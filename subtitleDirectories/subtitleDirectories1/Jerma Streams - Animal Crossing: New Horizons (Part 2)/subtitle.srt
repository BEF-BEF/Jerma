00:00:09,529 --> 00:00:22,890
Welcome back to Animal Crossing. This would be day 2 of Animal Crossing.

2
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,890
What do you mean it was real? I told you we were doing this yesterday.

3
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:28,280
Garbage game.

4
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,280
In the middle of like a bunch of pogs.

5
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,280
Garbage game.

6
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,280
God damn it. It's alright. Don't worry.

7
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,780
Let me just change one or two small things.

8
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:46,950
Have...eh...

9
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,950
That's good. It's gonna probably flash for a second.

10
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:53,020
Looks alright. I do have to change this.

11
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:59,539
There we go. So this is day 2.

12
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:04,510
Let me change the title.

13
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,510
Micro games 500% hurry.

14
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,510
This makes sense.

15
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:13,760
I mean this is like micro gaming, isn't it?

16
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,760
Animal Crossing. New Horizons.

17
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,500
Is this on the GameCube? No, it is not.

18
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:27,069
Not.

19
00:01:27,069 --> 00:01:29,069
So the question is, am I gonna keep a facecam on for this?

20
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:34,620
Fuck. I mean I turned it on already.

21
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:39,659
Fuck. I'm gonna have to.

22
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:47,010
Fuck. Alright, let's go.

23
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:49,010
Are you gonna get negative viewers? That's alright.

24
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:54,560
Whatever.

25
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:03,950
We're just playing Animal Crossing, man.

26
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,379
What's going on here? Is it Donald Duck?

27
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:08,560
Why is Donald Duck in the game?

28
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:21,789
Why is Donald Duck in this game?

29
00:02:21,789 --> 00:02:23,789
Testing, testing, test, test, test.

30
00:02:23,789 --> 00:02:25,789
Hello, every...

31
00:02:25,789 --> 00:02:27,789
Oh dear, so sorry about that.

32
00:02:27,789 --> 00:02:30,219
The volume's a little loud there.

33
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:34,379
Fix the screen?

34
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:41,229
What's wrong with the screen?

35
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:44,689
What do you mean the screen?

36
00:02:44,689 --> 00:02:48,590
Make it bigger.

37
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,590
What are you guys doing? Oh dear, so sorry about that.

38
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:53,340
The volume's a little loud.

39
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,340
Hello. Starting today, I'll be doing an island-wide

40
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,340
broadcast full of island updates going on and such.

41
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,400
I'll go over some things that are very important to island life,

42
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,400
so lend me your island ears for a short time.

43
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,919
It's the only thing that we kick off this daily ritual

44
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:10,919
with a doozy of an island announcement.

45
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:12,919
The Saltcrest Airport is now

46
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:17,719
open for business.

47
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:19,719
Starting today, you can use online or local communication

48
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:21,719
to fly to other islands for a visit.

49
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:23,719
That's not all. No, no, no. The airport counter now offers

50
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:25,719
a postal service as well.

51
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:29,879
And just like the Resident Service Center,

52
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:31,879
the airport is open 24 hours a day, so please drop by

53
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:34,310
for a look.

54
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,310
I do have one other item to share, and it too is a whopper.

55
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,310
As this very day, a brilliant fellow by the name of Blathers

56
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,310
will be joining us at Saltcrest.

57
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,490
That's the, uh, that's the...

58
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:47,009
Let Us In.

59
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:49,009
I'm not fucking giving you guys my Nintendo Switch address.

60
00:03:49,009 --> 00:03:51,009
That's a mistake.

61
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:53,889
As this very day, Blathers will be joining us

62
00:03:53,889 --> 00:03:55,889
at Saltcrest.

63
00:03:55,889 --> 00:03:57,889
He has a keen interest in biology,

64
00:03:57,889 --> 00:03:59,889
past and present, and he's here to study Saltcrest.

65
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:02,189
Still, I hope everyone lends their cooperation.

66
00:04:02,189 --> 00:04:04,189
Yes, this is the museum guy.

67
00:04:04,189 --> 00:04:06,189
Alright, let's go pick up weeds and shit.

68
00:04:06,189 --> 00:04:09,780
Let Us In.

69
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,780
I'm not, no, I'm not letting you guys in.

70
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:16,060
There are streamer codes.

71
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,970
I just want to pick up fucking weeds and stuff

72
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,970
and hit rocks with shovels for like an hour.

73
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,970
Oh, that's gotta change.

74
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,970
I forgot about this guy.

75
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,970
Uh, that looks bad. I don't want to look like this.

76
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,300
Whoa!

77
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,300
Look at all this mail.

78
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,300
Happy Home Academy.

79
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,300
Greetings from the Happy Home Academy, our goal

80
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,730
is to make your home the best.

81
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:47,040
Alright, gimme it.

82
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,040
The Nook Mileage Program

83
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,040
wishes to express our gratitude for your continued use

84
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,040
of the Nook Stomp and Nook Mileage Program.

85
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,040
The item you claim via our redemption is attached

86
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,339
to this message.

87
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,899
Oh, right, didn't I buy a bunch of shit yesterday?

88
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:04,060
Hold on.

89
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:09,819
We got a lot of crap in here.

90
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:14,819
Wooden mini table.

91
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:16,819
Sweet, I learned it. Oh, DIY wooden table.

92
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:18,819
Wait, I got a house now!

93
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,819
This isn't a tent anymore, this is a house.

94
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:28,819
Hold on.

95
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:30,819
Important.

96
00:05:30,819 --> 00:05:33,699
What are the tips?

97
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:35,699
Turn lights on in our decorating mode and open storage.

98
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:38,259
That's good to know.

99
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:40,939
Make the room brighter or dimmer.

100
00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:43,120
This feature lets you easily make design changes.

101
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,120
And open storage.

102
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,120
When in your home, you can open your pocket,

103
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,120
select furniture or other items. Yeah.

104
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,879
I like that better.

105
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:54,879
Okay, what about decorating?

106
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:57,500
Oh, I don't have anything.

107
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:03,180
I don't have shit.

108
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:08,819
Okay, well, let's pick this up. Put this in the corner.

109
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:12,399
I'm so glad you don't have to push this

110
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:18,860
and pull this and all that crap.

111
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,819
Switch. Right here.

112
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:25,629
And then the radio. Put this over here.

113
00:06:25,629 --> 00:06:27,629
This house is pretty bad.

114
00:06:27,629 --> 00:06:30,319
Radio in the middle so we can both listen to our favorite tunes.

115
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,319
And then the switch so we can both watch TV in bed.

116
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:38,000
Looks good.

117
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,439
No, that's the same thing.

118
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:47,339
Do I have anything else? No.

119
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:49,339
Alright, let's go get the elephant slides that I had.

120
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:54,829
Let's go put them in here.

121
00:06:54,829 --> 00:06:56,829
I've got lots of mail and all this stuff.

122
00:06:56,829 --> 00:07:01,120
Alright, hold on. What's this one?

123
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,279
Oh, eyes!

124
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:07,279
It's fucking 3D glasses.

125
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:09,279
Alright, where should I put my slides?

126
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:14,850
Change clothes.

127
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:17,730
My dear Jeremy,

128
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,730
how is your new life treating you?

129
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,730
Are you eating well, brushing your teeth, washing behind your ears?

130
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:23,730
Oh dear, I'm all worked up.

131
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,730
Here's a little something to help out.

132
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,730
Eat it or plant it, but think of me, says mom.

133
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:30,160
This is nice. This is sweet.

134
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,699
Alright, elephant slide. Get it.

135
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:38,860
I gotta go sell a bunch of crap.

136
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:42,379
Alright, hold on. Elephant slide.

137
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:46,399
Hell yeah.

138
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,829
It's just so good.

139
00:07:48,829 --> 00:07:51,329
Alright, what did mom give me?

140
00:07:51,329 --> 00:07:53,329
Apples. Ooh, thanks mom.

141
00:07:53,329 --> 00:08:03,620
Should I turn it this way?

142
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:11,279
Spin it. There we go.

143
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:13,579
Can I get on it? If I can't slide this,

144
00:08:13,579 --> 00:08:15,579
this is not worth 4,000 fucking bells.

145
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:20,959
I can't slide on the slide.

146
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:28,819
You've gotta be shitting me.

147
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:38,669
Put away the net?

148
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:40,669
How do you just put it away completely?

149
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:44,129
Tap A, don't hold.

150
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:49,629
How do you put something down? Down on D-pad?

151
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:54,820
Okay. I can't get on the slide.

152
00:08:54,820 --> 00:09:03,120
Bring it.

153
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,120
Alright, shopping. I got the loafers.

154
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:12,850
Can I store this? No.

155
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,850
ZL to check your nook miles.

156
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:19,259
Are those the same?

157
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:22,269
Slip on loafers?

158
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:24,269
What's the difference?

159
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:26,940
It's green. It's not a big difference.

160
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,940
Alright, I gotta get rid of some stuff.

161
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:32,450
I can't even open my mail.

162
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:34,450
I gotta go talk to the museum guy.

163
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:41,470
Dream house.

164
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:46,139
How many miles is it? 500, that's pretty good.

165
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:48,700
Put it in the house storage.

166
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:58,429
This is relaxing now.

167
00:09:58,429 --> 00:10:02,139
I'm like, this is good.

168
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:04,139
This is where I want to be.

169
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:06,450
Okay, how do I put this in here?

170
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:10,860
Put it in storage.

171
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,860
Am I gonna hang it on the wall?

172
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:16,450
I can hang the sneakers on the wall.

173
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,820
Why would I do that?

174
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:22,460
Alright, let's put...

175
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,899
I'll keep everything else.

176
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:31,620
In Back to the Future 3,

177
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,620
what profession did Doc Brown have?

178
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:37,710
He was a scientist.

179
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:45,009
Oh, they're blooming, that's cool.

180
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:47,009
Good. All the mail has been looked at.

181
00:10:47,009 --> 00:10:49,759
Right?

182
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:51,759
Wait, where's my...

183
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:54,769
Alright, I got everything.

184
00:10:54,769 --> 00:11:02,500
Alright, water this shit.

185
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,500
These are gonna be beautiful the next time we play.

186
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,080
Oh, shit.

187
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,700
I just realized something.

188
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,700
So, those of you that weren't here at the beginning of the stream,

189
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,700
I am not gonna be here

190
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,940
for at least a few days.

191
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,940
I will be gone for probably four or five

192
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,940
days.

193
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,940
I don't like to say that.

194
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,940
But,

195
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,940
I have a lot of shit to do

196
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,379
in my personal life.

197
00:11:29,379 --> 00:11:31,379
So, a lot of things going on

198
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:33,379
that has to be taken care of.

199
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:46,940
What am I gonna do about Animal Crossing?

200
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,940
Play offline and then update us.

201
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:52,340
Alright, what if I don't?

202
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,539
What if I just like, don't do that?

203
00:11:55,539 --> 00:11:57,539
Just play it off stream and update you guys?

204
00:11:57,539 --> 00:11:59,539
Is that okay?

205
00:11:59,539 --> 00:12:01,539
Alright, that sounds fun.

206
00:12:01,539 --> 00:12:03,539
I'm not gonna play that much, only like an hour or so a day.

207
00:12:03,539 --> 00:12:05,539
I might not even play it.

208
00:12:05,539 --> 00:12:09,820
I'm gonna be so fucking busy.

209
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,820
Those of you that are curious,

210
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,820
I'm moving.

211
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,059
Staying in Vegas.

212
00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:18,059
But I didn't want to make a big deal about it because obviously

213
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:20,059
many people hear that word.

214
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:22,059
And it's really, really bad timing too

215
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:24,059
because just everything is getting set here.

216
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:26,059
But,

217
00:12:26,059 --> 00:12:28,059
staying in Vegas, just going to a different spot.

218
00:12:28,059 --> 00:12:30,240
And,

219
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,240
I didn't want to really talk that much about it because obviously

220
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,240
when people hear the word moving, they go,

221
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,240
wait a minute, what, he's moving? He's fucking moving?

222
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,240
What's wrong? And so I don't want to, you know, make a big deal about it.

223
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,240
Staying in Vegas.

224
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,250
Somebody want to link the,

225
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,250
there's a link, there's a hashtag

226
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,250
exclamation point

227
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,250
thing that explains why

228
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,250
you read it,

229
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,250
read it,

230
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,250
it's right there, it's a few sentences.

231
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,549
Somebody's got it, right?

232
00:12:57,549 --> 00:13:01,460
No, no, no, no, nothing,

233
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,460
the exclamation point, there you go, somebody's got it, there you go.

234
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:06,139
Why isn't that one working?

235
00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:08,139
So you see, since the number of hormones is increasing, I agree that we need

236
00:13:08,139 --> 00:13:10,139
Oh, there's like a person face down with me.

237
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:12,700
Hold on.

238
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,700
I should probably do that.

239
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:19,059
I have every confidence that

240
00:13:19,059 --> 00:13:21,059
you'll find a way to handle this little puzzle.

241
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:23,059
Holy shit, he's fucking

242
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:25,059
moving? See, this is what I'm talking about.

243
00:13:25,059 --> 00:13:28,620
This is what I was talking about.

244
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,620
Uh, the two of you have been training under me for how many

245
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,570
years now? Hmm.

246
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:37,019
This should be a piece of cake.

247
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:39,389
No more of rumor.

248
00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:41,389
I don't, I don't know.

249
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:43,389
I don't think that's possible in Las Vegas to not

250
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:46,399
have a rumor. I don't think that's possible.

251
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,340
Are you happy with your home?

252
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,340
Is it meeting your expectations that you'll

253
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,340
be a lot more comfortable now?

254
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,340
Houses are so different from tents.

255
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,340
You can freely change up the flooring and wallpaper.

256
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,340
You've got some

257
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,340
built-in storage so you can put away the furniture you aren't

258
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,340
using.

259
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,779
There's more! There's more.

260
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:07,779
All homeowners are automatically

261
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:09,779
registered with the Happy Home Academy.

262
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:11,779
Uh, and evaluate your

263
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:13,779
home on a regular basis to send you helpful advice.

264
00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:15,779
Are you going to evaluate my house?

265
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:19,779
No more streams for another season?

266
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:21,950
No, no.

267
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:23,950
The move from Vegas to

268
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,950
Vegas is not the same as

269
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,950
the move from Boston to Vegas.

270
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,129
One of them is across the country.

271
00:14:30,129 --> 00:14:32,940
The other one's in the same city.

272
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,179
So, I will be back

273
00:14:35,179 --> 00:14:37,490
within

274
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,490
four or five days. It won't, it's not going to

275
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:44,669
take that long. Trust me.

276
00:14:44,669 --> 00:14:46,669
Yeah, the mileage on a hot air balloon,

277
00:14:46,669 --> 00:14:48,669
I'll get there in like four, six,

278
00:14:48,669 --> 00:14:50,669
seven days, something like that.

279
00:14:50,669 --> 00:14:53,549
Four to five years.

280
00:14:53,549 --> 00:14:55,549
Not four to five decades!

281
00:14:55,549 --> 00:14:57,549
Am I even going to be alive in five

282
00:14:57,549 --> 00:15:01,820
decades? How old am I?

283
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,820
I'll be like 85!

284
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,820
Am I going to be alive when I'm like 90?

285
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,820
I don't even, that's like a long

286
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:16,659
fucking time. Why do I like

287
00:15:16,659 --> 00:15:19,409
Vegas? Well, we,

288
00:15:19,409 --> 00:15:21,409
I mean, you're talking about a conversation

289
00:15:21,409 --> 00:15:23,409
we had dozens and dozens

290
00:15:23,409 --> 00:15:25,409
of times almost two years ago.

291
00:15:25,409 --> 00:15:27,580
I'm here. I love it here.

292
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,820
I love this city.

293
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,509
I want to stay in this city. Pretty much it.

294
00:15:32,509 --> 00:15:35,139
Oh, that

295
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:37,139
98,000 bells.

296
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:39,139
Can I pay in miles?

297
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:42,269
Can you pay in miles?

298
00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:46,029
Oh, no.

299
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:48,340
What's going to have to do with Tallix?

300
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,340
I think Tallix is staying here. I think

301
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,769
Tallix is staying in Vegas too. That's the

302
00:15:52,769 --> 00:15:55,580
plan. So,

303
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,950
look, the last couple

304
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,950
years has been

305
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,950
sort of a trial period if

306
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:04,259
it was something that we wanted to even do.

307
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:07,139
You know, I remember this,

308
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:09,139
I've never done anything like this before.

309
00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:11,139
I lived in Massachusetts my entire life.

310
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:13,379
So, coming out across

311
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:15,379
the whole country was like, you know, obviously

312
00:16:15,379 --> 00:16:17,379
I wanted to spend a year or two years

313
00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:19,379
or so to find out

314
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:21,740
is this something I actually want to do? Do I

315
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,740
actually want to be here more than a year or two?

316
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,740
That was for everybody involved.

317
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,980
And the answer is yes.

318
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,720
And wherever,

319
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,720
you know, wherever

320
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,720
Tallix ends up wanting to be, that's where he wants to be.

321
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,470
I'm pretty sure he's

322
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:39,899
staying in Vegas. That's at least the plan.

323
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:43,740
But that's kind of what,

324
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,240
that's the way it is, right?

325
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,240
I forgot about the nightbot command. Oh, no.

326
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,529
Enter the gamer hubs.

327
00:16:52,529 --> 00:16:54,529
No, he's not staying with me. No, not anymore.

328
00:16:54,529 --> 00:16:57,649
Not after this week.

329
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:59,649
Is Kim? Yes, Kim is coming with me.

330
00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:01,649
Him and I will be moving and so will

331
00:17:01,649 --> 00:17:05,299
Tallix as well. But I can't,

332
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:07,539
this is, I obviously

333
00:17:07,539 --> 00:17:09,539
don't want to make a big deal about moving

334
00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:11,539
because I'm not going very far.

335
00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:13,900
I'm staying in the city of Las Vegas.

336
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,900
So you, honestly, I'll be honest with you,

337
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,079
you probably won't even really see a

338
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,079
difference for stream downtime

339
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,710
because

340
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,210
the plan is by this

341
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:29,539
weekend to be done. We'll see.

342
00:17:29,539 --> 00:17:33,819
What about Otto? Do you honestly

343
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,819
think that my dog is not coming with me?

344
00:17:35,819 --> 00:17:38,450
What, how, what

345
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:43,059
are you talking about? Yeah,

346
00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:45,059
we're gonna keep it going. Otto, you know, Otto's

347
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:47,059
gonna go get his own place, I think.

348
00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:49,059
Otto's thinking about going and checking out some places.

349
00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:52,259
He was apartment hunting the other day.

350
00:17:52,259 --> 00:17:54,259
No, he's, he's my dog.

351
00:17:54,259 --> 00:17:58,210
Anyways, uh,

352
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,210
again, don't want to make a big deal about it because it's not a big deal at all.

353
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:02,509
Not a big deal.

354
00:18:02,509 --> 00:18:07,569
Not a big deal. Are you and Otto still

355
00:18:07,569 --> 00:18:11,789
friends? Payments can be made using

356
00:18:11,789 --> 00:18:13,789
the ABD feature of the Nook Stop.

357
00:18:13,789 --> 00:18:15,789
I think that's everything I need to tell you about homes

358
00:18:15,789 --> 00:18:19,180
today.

359
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:22,579
Otto is coming with me. I've said it like

360
00:18:22,579 --> 00:18:25,839
five times. I have a nice surprise

361
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:28,019
for you. You ready for this?

362
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:30,019
It's a premium miles redemption,

363
00:18:30,019 --> 00:18:32,509
a Nook Miles ticket.

364
00:18:32,509 --> 00:18:34,509
Pretty sick. What is a Nook Miles

365
00:18:34,509 --> 00:18:39,759
ticket?

366
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:41,759
It's a conundrum. We want to improve our island

367
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:43,759
but still hold on to that deserted island magic.

368
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:46,380
Well, now you can do both.

369
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,380
You can use one of these tickets

370
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,380
to do some island hopping adventuring. But yes, just

371
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,380
go anytime you want. If you're looking to meet

372
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,380
some new characters and gather materials for DIY projects,

373
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,380
excellent. Answer what question?

374
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,380
Answer the question. What, what question?

375
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,690
What question do you have? What are you talking about?

376
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:02,690
I just did. What question do you have?

377
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:04,690
You got me, you got me for 10 seconds. What question?

378
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:10,960
What do you got? What about Cheeto?

379
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,259
Yes. Are you and Otto

380
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:18,000
friends? Yes. Do you eat

381
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,779
ass? I plead with it!

382
00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:28,480
Anything else?

383
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,910
No, she's not. I'm not even going to say it out loud.

384
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,910
Are you still

385
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:35,789
friends with Otto? Yes. Is Otto

386
00:19:35,789 --> 00:19:37,789
a dog? Yes. You got four more seconds.

387
00:19:37,789 --> 00:19:40,349
What about Chad? You guys don't, you guys

388
00:19:40,349 --> 00:19:42,349
don't live in my house.

389
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:44,349
No, you won't be coming with me in my house.

390
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:50,740
Any plans to...

391
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,740
We don't, you don't, you don't live in

392
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,740
my, no, you don't live in, you don't

393
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:58,640
live here. You don't,

394
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,640
none of you guys are here in this house.

395
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,460
So how can I bring you to the new,

396
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,460
a new place when you don't occupy

397
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,460
this house, this room here?

398
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:10,660
Alright, fine. I'm turning the fucking

399
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,660
digital vacuum on. No, this is weird.

400
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,660
This is weird. This is going to get weird. I don't want to do that.

401
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:17,150
Alright, you got me for two more seconds.

402
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:22,720
I'm not doing like a fucking, Jerma sucks

403
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,720
you up in a digital vacuum thing.

404
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,789
That's fucking weird. I don't like

405
00:20:27,789 --> 00:20:29,789
that. You like the Olive Garden? Of course I do.

406
00:20:29,789 --> 00:20:31,789
I especially love...

407
00:20:31,789 --> 00:20:33,789
Out of all the things there, my favorite part

408
00:20:33,789 --> 00:20:35,789
about going to the Olive Garden has to be...

409
00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:45,789
Smoked mozzarella chicken.

410
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:50,349
I'm actually fucking just doing ads for

411
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:52,349
Olive Garden this whole stream.

412
00:20:52,349 --> 00:20:55,039
I didn't even pay me any money or anything.

413
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,539
I'm doing this for no reason.

414
00:20:57,539 --> 00:20:59,539
I am like shouting out the fuck

415
00:20:59,539 --> 00:21:01,539
out of the Olive Garden for

416
00:21:01,539 --> 00:21:03,539
almost two straight hours.

417
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:06,799
This is just for free.

418
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:17,470
Whatever.

419
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,470
That's for breadsticks. By the way,

420
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,650
they're endless. If you didn't know.

421
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:24,589
Alright, I could...

422
00:21:24,589 --> 00:21:26,589
I could play a game.

423
00:21:26,589 --> 00:21:28,589
Get the camera off.

424
00:21:28,589 --> 00:21:30,589
I could play a game. I'm playing a video game

425
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:34,559
right now. I'll have to take it to the counter

426
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,559
to use it whenever you have travel strikes.

427
00:21:41,059 --> 00:21:44,829
Wait, don't they have recycle?

428
00:21:44,829 --> 00:21:49,420
Alright, let's go. Camera on.

429
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,420
No, no, it's late. It's getting late.

430
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:56,299
No, I don't... I do not want to

431
00:21:56,299 --> 00:21:58,299
put the camera on. I think it's time

432
00:21:58,299 --> 00:22:00,299
to just kind of hang out and chill.

433
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:02,480
Take a... I don't...

434
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,480
The camera doesn't have to be on anymore.

435
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,480
What's the point of the camera? What does the camera have to be on for

436
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,190
every day? Doesn't have to be.

437
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:13,519
What's the point? I can just not have the camera on

438
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:28,480
when I don't feel like it. Alright, here we go.

439
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,480
Let's play. What are some chores

440
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,480
I can do today? Oh, somebody's like

441
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,480
on the ground over there, right? Wait.

442
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,200
I gotta go down here. Oh, the fucking

443
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,019
game sound is muted.

444
00:22:42,019 --> 00:22:44,019
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

445
00:22:44,019 --> 00:22:48,299
Alright, where's that person that was on the

446
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:55,920
beach? Get the bottle? I don't have

447
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:59,700
any room for the bottle. I don't have any room.

448
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,700
Oh, my pockets are full already.

449
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,000
I just put it down. I don't have any

450
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,779
room. I don't have any fucking room.

451
00:23:07,779 --> 00:23:09,779
What is this? Elephant slide.

452
00:23:09,779 --> 00:23:16,180
You know what? Just... What is this?

453
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:21,220
Ooh. There's someone out there

454
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,220
somewhere. The latest trend to

455
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,220
hit the waves is a little something I call self-care.

456
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,220
And how can you do that if you can't see yourself?

457
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,220
Take a little you time to make

458
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,220
this and any other recipe that floats

459
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,220
to shore. Cool.

460
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,390
Wooden full-length

461
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:42,430
mirror. That's cool.

462
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:45,380
Alright, okay.

463
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:50,500
Let's go talk to the

464
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:56,619
new guy. Donald Duck.

465
00:23:56,619 --> 00:23:58,619
The waves. The waves are good. Already the

466
00:23:58,619 --> 00:24:00,619
pool noodles.

467
00:24:00,619 --> 00:24:06,509
I've asked storms to come and brace yourselves,

468
00:24:06,509 --> 00:24:09,779
lads. Hard to starboard,

469
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:11,779
tough to port, stern to stern.

470
00:24:11,779 --> 00:24:19,250
Oh, it's not Donald Duck.

471
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,250
It's Donald Pelican.

472
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,420
Blur. Do you have my

473
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,420
pickled herring pizza? I already tipped

474
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,420
online, so...

475
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,420
Wait, I don't see a pizza. Where am I? Where are you? Who am I?

476
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,920
Oh, hang on. I know that one.

477
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,920
I'm none other than Gulliver, a seafaring

478
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,799
seagull of the seven seas.

479
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,799
Were you the one who kept nudging me just now?

480
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,799
Thanks for the wake-up call.

481
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,799
Those hasty hallucinations tend to sneak

482
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,799
up on me. You find it

483
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,799
hard to forgive this waterlogged bird brain?

484
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,799
I'm reading your vacant expression

485
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,799
as a yes, you.

486
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,799
As I dozed off and tumbled overboard

487
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,799
again. That's an endearing

488
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,799
character trait of mine. My crewmates love

489
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,799
it when I slip over the bow. Ha!

490
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,799
Don't worry, the fellas

491
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,799
will be here to rescue me in no time. Got an ace

492
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,799
up my wing, you see.

493
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,799
I'll just call for help using my handy

494
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,170
dandy, uh...

495
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:11,170
Oh my. Oh my

496
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:13,170
gosh. My handy dandy communicator is

497
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:15,170
broken. This isn't handy OR dandy!

498
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:17,170
Oh, sardines. It's all cracked and busted.

499
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:19,170
Looks like it's missing a few communicator

500
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:21,470
parts. That means

501
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:23,470
I'll have to wait for my crew to find me

502
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:25,470
on their own.

503
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,470
That could take a while. I've only got enough

504
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:29,470
nautical puns to last a couple more hours.

505
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:31,470
I'm begging you, will you look for my

506
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,470
communicator parts, please?

507
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:38,269
Sure.

508
00:25:44,269 --> 00:25:46,269
Communication parts are probably buried in the sand somewhere.

509
00:25:46,269 --> 00:25:48,269
I'm just missing five parts.

510
00:25:48,269 --> 00:25:50,269
Find them, I'll try to clear.

511
00:25:50,269 --> 00:25:52,269
Get them back together again.

512
00:25:52,269 --> 00:25:54,269
I'm sure my crewmates are looking for me, so

513
00:25:54,269 --> 00:25:56,269
I better stay here and watch for the boat.

514
00:25:56,269 --> 00:25:58,269
I'll leave the searching to you!

515
00:25:58,269 --> 00:26:00,269
I believe in you, partner. I don't have much of a choice.

516
00:26:00,269 --> 00:26:03,220
But let me get this straight.

517
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,220
Um, this character is

518
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,460
not in your game. But he's in mine.

519
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:10,509
Right?

520
00:26:10,509 --> 00:26:20,299
Is this possible?

521
00:26:20,299 --> 00:26:22,539
He shows up in everybody's.

522
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,539
This one everyone gets.

523
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:27,420
Oh, okay. There you are.

524
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:30,750
Okay, let's give him some creatures.

525
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:33,380
Ooh, a pleasure to meet you.

526
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,380
My name is Blathers.

527
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,380
I'm exceedingly interested in the ecosystem of this island.

528
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,380
Thus I have come to conduct research,

529
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:42,130
if you will. Could you be

530
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:44,130
that you are Jeremy, the personage

531
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:46,130
who chose the location for this tent?

532
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:48,130
I am.

533
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:50,369
Splendid job indeed, thanks to you, I was able to

534
00:26:50,369 --> 00:26:52,369
uh, I thought they said

535
00:26:52,369 --> 00:26:54,369
I'd. I was able to

536
00:26:54,369 --> 00:26:56,369
I'd. I was able to get on here.

537
00:26:56,369 --> 00:26:58,609
Now regarding the aforementioned research,

538
00:26:58,609 --> 00:27:00,609
truth be told, I am determined

539
00:27:00,609 --> 00:27:02,609
to open a museum and henceforth dwell on this

540
00:27:02,609 --> 00:27:04,609
island amongst you.

541
00:27:04,609 --> 00:27:06,779
If you discover any new types of inspector fish, come

542
00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:08,779
bring it here. I will exhibit

543
00:27:08,779 --> 00:27:10,779
them, as well as those you gave to Tom Nook.

544
00:27:10,779 --> 00:27:13,339
Now there's one small problem.

545
00:27:13,339 --> 00:27:15,650
I lack the number of exhibits needed to secure

546
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:17,650
permission to open a museum proper.

547
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:19,650
Empty display cases will not do, I'm told.

548
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:21,650
Display cases with something to display? That is another matter.

549
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:23,890
Where are you coming? Allow me

550
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:25,890
to explain.

551
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:27,890
I need insects. It's not just insects

552
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:29,890
and fish. I want fossils.

553
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:32,640
This is a substantial stretch of land

554
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,839
beyond the river. I would bet my pin

555
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:37,839
feathers. This primitive plot is flushed

556
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:41,299
with the fossils I require. On the river you say

557
00:27:41,299 --> 00:27:43,299
I can't just go over it? Well, it's a boat.

558
00:27:43,299 --> 00:27:46,670
Get on one. Pardon me, Jeremy,

559
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:48,670
while I transmit the vital data to your Nook phone.

560
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:55,950
I want to drink out of that.

561
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:57,950
Anybody else want to drink out of that thing?

562
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,950
There you see, with wood

563
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:01,950
gathered from salt, Chris one can

564
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,950
make a legendary pole vault.

565
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,950
This pole can be used to propel

566
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,950
oneself across the river. Up and over you go. Hooty

567
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:10,579
hoo. I sent DIY

568
00:28:10,579 --> 00:28:12,750
schematics for a shovel. I dig

569
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,750
fossils from the ground as well, which brings me to my

570
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,750
point. Please,

571
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,750
Jeremy, cross the river and seek out these ancient

572
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:21,119
relics. My feathers have

573
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:23,809
lathered on for too long, but let me leave you with this.

574
00:28:23,809 --> 00:28:25,809
Time to open the museum. I must acquire more items

575
00:28:25,809 --> 00:28:28,430
to exhibit 15. I hope

576
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:35,140
you do it. What do I got? I have things

577
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,630
to donate.

578
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:40,190
Okay, so I have...

579
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:44,930
Take this moth. I got a bunch of shit outside

580
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:48,319
too. Repugnance.

581
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:50,319
What happens if I miss-maintain my composure?

582
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:52,319
I beg your pardon. Bugs I do detest

583
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:55,140
them. Wait, aren't you...don't you want them?

584
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:58,589
Still, there's much I can tell you about the

585
00:28:58,589 --> 00:29:00,900
insect you apprehended. If you insist that is.

586
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:04,849
No. I know what a moth is.

587
00:29:04,849 --> 00:29:06,849
That's the joke.

588
00:29:06,849 --> 00:29:10,430
Bugs are the bane of my existence.

589
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:13,500
Rest assured the wretched thing will get the best of care here.

590
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,809
It's supposed to be funny, Jeremy.

591
00:29:15,809 --> 00:29:18,299
It was!

592
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:21,059
By the way, I wonder if you have anything else

593
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:23,940
that could be donated. I do.

594
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:27,819
Here, take this.

595
00:29:27,819 --> 00:29:32,349
Prussian carp.

596
00:29:32,349 --> 00:29:34,349
Any facts

597
00:29:34,349 --> 00:29:37,099
about the carp you want to know? No.

598
00:29:37,099 --> 00:29:39,730
It's a fish.

599
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:46,619
It fucking eats algae. Cool.

600
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:53,339
13 more. This dude's going feral?

601
00:29:53,339 --> 00:29:57,420
Why am I going feral?

602
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,420
Okay, I will get plenty. You know what?

603
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,599
I want...oops, don't do that.

604
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:05,869
Look at all these animals that I have out here.

605
00:30:05,869 --> 00:30:10,349
I was going to clean up...okay, let's go.

606
00:30:10,349 --> 00:30:20,210
We will get the lore of the hermit crab, I promise.

607
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:24,940
Why am I not an animal?

608
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:32,910
Hermit crab.

609
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:36,240
Hermit crab, ugh, what a wretched thing.

610
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,240
I don't like bugs. Hermit crab's not a bug?

611
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,680
Hold on. Hermit crab is not

612
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:45,460
a bug. It's like crustacean.

613
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:48,079
It's like a crab. It's not a bug?

614
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:53,309
Tell me about it. In that case,

615
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:56,380
ugh. Hermit crab is not an insect.

616
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,380
Well, it most certainly resembles one,

617
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,380
bleh. It looks much like a spider

618
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,380
with its creepy eyes and crawly legs,

619
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,940
but it is in fact a crustacean.

620
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,940
That sucks. The hermit crab has ten legs and also

621
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,940
wears a shell, but it doesn't grow this shell itself.

622
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,440
It slips its soft body...I mean, we're reading

623
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,440
a Wikipedia article about...that took the first

624
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,440
four lines of hermit crab

625
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,369
entry. We don't need to do this.

626
00:31:18,369 --> 00:31:23,099
I know what a hermit crab is. Talk about a strange

627
00:31:23,099 --> 00:31:25,099
way to make it. Anywho, thanks for the donation.

628
00:31:25,099 --> 00:31:31,500
Any more donations? I think I have one more, yeah?

629
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:35,279
Yeah, take this.

630
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:39,740
Bag worm.

631
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,740
Let him do the job. He loves it.

632
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:44,109
No, he hates it apparently, because

633
00:31:44,109 --> 00:31:46,990
he doesn't like any of these things.

634
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:51,710
Alright, you can read it. Here. It's caterpillar.

635
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:54,319
It uses silk.

636
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:59,039
It's very cute. It dangles.

637
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,039
They hide their bug bodies in

638
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,039
leaves. They eat trees.

639
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,039
They're villains.

640
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:11,440
Let me go.

641
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:34,779
Let me in.

642
00:32:34,779 --> 00:32:36,779
Let me in.

643
00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:39,789
Blathers, I've got more things for you.

644
00:32:39,789 --> 00:32:42,859
Is Jerma's character the Joker?

645
00:32:42,859 --> 00:32:54,579
I got a lot of stuff.

646
00:32:54,579 --> 00:32:59,059
All I have are bugs and shit.

647
00:32:59,059 --> 00:33:01,059
Alright, here's another centipede.

648
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:12,609
Sure, let's find out.

649
00:33:12,609 --> 00:33:14,609
The centipede's name means one hundred

650
00:33:14,609 --> 00:33:16,609
legs, but I tell you now, that's a lie.

651
00:33:16,609 --> 00:33:18,609
These ugly bugs can have as few

652
00:33:18,609 --> 00:33:20,609
as fifteen pairs, or as many

653
00:33:20,609 --> 00:33:22,609
as a hundred and seventy-one.

654
00:33:22,609 --> 00:33:24,849
Because of how their bodies are segmented,

655
00:33:24,849 --> 00:33:26,849
they never have exactly a hundred.

656
00:33:26,849 --> 00:33:28,849
Ooh, it's true.

657
00:33:28,849 --> 00:33:30,849
You know what else is true? Centipedes are

658
00:33:30,849 --> 00:33:32,849
carnivorous, aggressive, and venomous.

659
00:33:32,849 --> 00:33:34,849
Their bite is quite painful too.

660
00:33:34,849 --> 00:33:36,849
Horrible.

661
00:33:36,849 --> 00:33:38,849
Anywho, my sincerest thanks

662
00:33:38,849 --> 00:33:41,150
for your donation.

663
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:43,150
No bugs are the bane of my existence. Thank you.

664
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:45,150
Fun fact about centipedes.

665
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,150
If you see

666
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,779
a centipede,

667
00:33:49,779 --> 00:33:51,779
you're supposed to leave it alone. The centipede

668
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,779
is such an aggressive psycho, it

669
00:33:53,779 --> 00:33:55,779
will eat and kill all the other awful bugs

670
00:33:55,779 --> 00:34:00,190
that are even near your property.

671
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:02,190
A centipede is like the ultimate

672
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:04,190
ultimate hunter.

673
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:06,430
And they kill like scorpions and shit,

674
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:08,429
and spiders, and just leave

675
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:10,429
those motherfuckers alone. Let them just

676
00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:12,429
wreck havoc

677
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:14,429
on the pests that inhabit your house.

678
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:27,730
No one cares about centipedes.

679
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:29,730
I mean, I didn't tell you

680
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:31,730
to touch your tongue on it.

681
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:34,929
Just leave it alone.

682
00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:36,929
If it's in your house, just get it out of your house.

683
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:38,929
But if you see one around your house, I don't know, just leave it alone.

684
00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:43,659
I gotta bring most stuff.

685
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:47,699
Is this a fossil? Wait.

686
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:51,659
That's another fossil?

687
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:53,659
I need to get a shovel. Alright, back to the...

688
00:34:53,659 --> 00:35:02,880
I gotta go sell. It was one in my room

689
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,309
last week. Man, it probably

690
00:35:05,309 --> 00:35:07,309
wiped out the scary

691
00:35:07,309 --> 00:35:09,309
spider collection that may have been

692
00:35:09,309 --> 00:35:12,699
in your house. So you should just be thankful

693
00:35:12,699 --> 00:35:21,019
of the centipede.

694
00:35:21,019 --> 00:35:23,019
Hello. What would you like to talk to me about?

695
00:35:23,019 --> 00:35:26,980
No, no, no. I'm good. Other person.

696
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:31,329
Team Spider.

697
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:36,260
Did I tell you? I saw

698
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,260
the... I said the

699
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:40,260
other day, but this is horseshit.

700
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:43,139
It was probably like six months ago.

701
00:35:43,139 --> 00:35:45,139
I saw a

702
00:35:45,139 --> 00:35:47,139
fake widow. Whatever they're called.

703
00:35:47,139 --> 00:35:49,440
They're called like fraud widows.

704
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,940
They look like black widows.

705
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,940
They're big. Their legs are so terrifying.

706
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:56,369
It was terrifying. It was just outside.

707
00:35:56,369 --> 00:35:59,500
Those things are

708
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:04,559
scary.

709
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:06,559
It's a fraud. Yeah, it's actually called like

710
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:12,000
fraud widow.

711
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Proposal?

712
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,219
Proposal. Sure.

713
00:36:44,849 --> 00:36:46,849
There it is.

714
00:36:50,849 --> 00:36:54,349
False widow spider. There it is.

715
00:36:54,349 --> 00:36:56,349
I'm getting drunk.

716
00:36:56,349 --> 00:36:58,780
We'll need a lot of materials for proper

717
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,780
shops. So bring in wood and

718
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,780
stuff. Yeah, well, we'll do it.

719
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:08,860
Here's the items.

720
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:12,000
30 pieces of wood.

721
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,710
Wait, 90? 30 iron

722
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,710
uggets and 90 pieces of different wood.

723
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:21,679
Okay.

724
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:25,070
Holy shit, man.

725
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:28,719
All right. Well, here, I want to sell stuff.

726
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:30,719
Here, take this. I want to sell.

727
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:34,289
Let's get rid of

728
00:37:34,289 --> 00:37:36,289
these.

729
00:37:36,289 --> 00:37:39,360
These.

730
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:44,210
What else

731
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:50,210
should I get rid of?

732
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:53,340
I don't know what else to sell. Sell the weed?

733
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,340
Oh, I'm going to keep the weed.

734
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,340
Sell the nest too.

735
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:01,420
I guess so.

736
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:04,559
1,400 bills.

737
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:06,800
I got money in the

738
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:11,539
bank. Look, I got money in the bank.

739
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:21,900
I've got $5,500

740
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,139
in the bank. Loan payment.

741
00:38:24,139 --> 00:38:26,380
Pay from savings. Let's do

742
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,380
$2,000 onto our loan.

743
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:36,769
When am I going to play Odama next?

744
00:38:36,769 --> 00:38:40,139
I don't...

745
00:38:40,139 --> 00:38:42,139
I'm not playing that game again.

746
00:38:42,139 --> 00:38:48,219
You'll never see that game again.

747
00:38:48,219 --> 00:38:55,889
Not happening.

748
00:38:55,889 --> 00:38:57,889
Okay, so I need to find... I need to make

749
00:38:57,889 --> 00:39:01,150
a shovel. Let's take and make a shovel.

750
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:03,710
Let's collect some stuff first.

751
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:05,710
There's a rock down here. Let me hit the rock.

752
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:08,269
I need a bunch of wood too.

753
00:39:08,269 --> 00:39:11,019
Each tree has three wood.

754
00:39:11,019 --> 00:39:13,019
Is that three wood a day?

755
00:39:13,019 --> 00:39:17,949
I might be able to do the shop thing today.

756
00:39:17,949 --> 00:39:28,940
I should probably not.

757
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,940
The wood's the easy part. Oh, I need the

758
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:40,480
iron. Should I talk to Phoebe?

759
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,369
Yo, Jeremy!

760
00:39:44,369 --> 00:39:46,369
Hold on. I'll have time for you in a minute.

761
00:39:46,369 --> 00:39:49,699
Get out of my way! Get out!

762
00:39:49,699 --> 00:39:54,110
Stop! Get the fuck

763
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:56,110
out of my way. I've got stuff to do.

764
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:58,110
Oh my god, you've ruined everything.

765
00:39:58,110 --> 00:40:04,320
Cool. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

766
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,320
Nice. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Cool. Thanks for the lunch.

767
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,320
I figured out how to make a lunch.

768
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,320
Okay, cool. You can make a shovel

769
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,320
now. Thank you. There's gold over there.

770
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:21,150
Okay, thank you.

771
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:23,150
I'm rude? I only have about five

772
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:25,150
seconds to hit this stuff. Thanks for the...

773
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:28,610
Thanks for that. I'm so rude.

774
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:30,610
No! I'm clearly working and they

775
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:32,610
got in my way. You don't go walk into a

776
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:34,610
guy swinging an axe and go, hey, I have a question

777
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:36,610
for you. Is my face too close to your

778
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:38,980
backswing? Get out of here.

779
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:54,590
I was rude.

780
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:57,789
I just gave you a shovel. Be more fucking

781
00:40:57,789 --> 00:41:00,030
grateful.

782
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:02,030
Hey, now you're being rude

783
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:06,699
to me. It's a never

784
00:41:06,699 --> 00:41:08,699
ending cycle of rudeness.

785
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:18,500
I'll see you guys next week for the City of Heroes

786
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:21,059
stream. That'll be fun.

787
00:41:21,059 --> 00:41:24,579
We're gonna work together.

788
00:41:24,579 --> 00:41:26,579
We're gonna have a superhero group of like

789
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:28,579
4,000 of us.

790
00:41:28,579 --> 00:41:31,840
It'll be really cool. It'll be fun.

791
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:40,420
Gold nugget. Nice.

792
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:45,389
Alright, what does it take to make a shovel?

793
00:41:45,389 --> 00:41:47,389
Here, I'll talk to you. I'm sorry.

794
00:41:47,389 --> 00:41:51,039
Am I being pranked? Is there a hidden camera?

795
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:53,039
Let's talk.

796
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:56,110
That game is dead.

797
00:41:56,110 --> 00:42:01,869
Omega lol.

798
00:42:01,869 --> 00:42:03,869
Wait, the game doesn't even turn on.

799
00:42:03,869 --> 00:42:06,559
Is the server gone?

800
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:09,179
The servers are gone. I can't even play it.

801
00:42:09,179 --> 00:42:14,300
He's a

802
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:19,230
fan server. Okay.

803
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:21,230
There's a fan server. Well, I don't want to

804
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:23,230
diarrhea all over somebody's

805
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:25,230
fan server with like

806
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:27,230
5,000 fucking accounts made on it.

807
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:29,409
I'm not gonna do that.

808
00:42:29,409 --> 00:42:32,739
You better invite me over soon.

809
00:42:32,739 --> 00:42:42,719
Did I learn the shovel?

810
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:46,300
DIY? Play Champions Online?

811
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:58,780
Here we go.

812
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:00,780
It's hardwood. Shovel!

813
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:06,480
Let's have a sleepover.

814
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:11,789
Ooh, wait. I can make all this stuff.

815
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:14,929
I'm gonna make a little table.

816
00:43:14,929 --> 00:43:22,909
And we're gonna make a mirror.

817
00:43:22,909 --> 00:43:34,690
I have to have furniture in my house.

818
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:39,340
Alright, that's good for now. Okay.

819
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:41,340
Nook miles. What did I get?

820
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:44,099
I actually have a lot of miles.

821
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:49,920
5,000 is the inventory upgrade, right?

822
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:57,730
Furniture. Flower tender.

823
00:43:57,730 --> 00:44:02,019
I almost set the inventory upgrade.

824
00:44:02,019 --> 00:44:06,800
Very cool.

825
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:12,300
Okay. I need to make another axe.

826
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:15,309
Do I have enough for an axe?

827
00:44:15,309 --> 00:44:17,619
That's a net. That's not an axe.

828
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:28,900
Okay. Do the pole.

829
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:33,630
Oh yeah, the pole vault, right?

830
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:37,019
New vaulting pole.

831
00:44:37,019 --> 00:44:39,460
Pockets are too full. Shit.

832
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:43,679
I gotta get, hold on.

833
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:56,800
I gotta get this stuff in my house.

834
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,000
I gotta deposit some shit.

835
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:14,210
Okay, so mirror.

836
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:17,539
Turn the lights back on.

837
00:45:17,539 --> 00:45:20,539
Wooden full length mirror.

838
00:45:20,539 --> 00:45:22,539
Nice.

839
00:45:22,539 --> 00:45:24,780
What can I do with it?

840
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:27,659
Can I change up my look?

841
00:45:27,659 --> 00:45:31,119
What do you mean change up my look?

842
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:33,940
Oh, you can change your haircut and stuff?

843
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:39,179
That's kinda cool.

844
00:45:39,179 --> 00:45:41,679
Alright.

845
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:44,369
A little table.

846
00:45:44,369 --> 00:45:46,369
Nice.

847
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:48,369
And a elephants slide.

848
00:45:48,369 --> 00:46:03,150
Put the elephants slide down here.

849
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:06,420
I'll plant an apple.

850
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:09,230
Actually, I'll plant two apple trees.

851
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:16,340
Why not?

852
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:18,340
Alright, this looks like a fucking temple.

853
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:22,619
World of slides.

854
00:46:22,619 --> 00:46:24,619
Alright, now...

855
00:46:24,619 --> 00:46:26,619
I wanna go back.

856
00:46:26,619 --> 00:46:28,619
Make the pole and go across the river.

857
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:38,989
The people want 30 minutes slow mode.

858
00:46:38,989 --> 00:46:42,449
I don't think they do.

859
00:46:42,449 --> 00:46:45,389
I'm not sure they do.

860
00:46:45,389 --> 00:46:53,739
Okay.

861
00:46:53,739 --> 00:46:57,199
It begins.

862
00:46:57,199 --> 00:46:59,199
So, I wanna go help Donald Duck first.

863
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:03,300
I'll head down there.

864
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:06,239
Wait.

865
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:25,099
Come on.

866
00:47:25,099 --> 00:47:31,380
That kinda was a bad haul.

867
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:36,750
Suboptimal grinding.

868
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:38,750
I'm not gonna do 30 minutes slow mode.

869
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:40,750
No, why would I do that?

870
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:43,119
Flimsy shovel and shovel.

871
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:59,179
Okay, so I have to do

872
00:47:59,179 --> 00:48:01,179
look for holes, things to dig on the beach?

873
00:48:01,179 --> 00:48:03,619
Oh, the bird gave me the shovel.

874
00:48:03,619 --> 00:48:06,110
Didn't you say my stuff's on the beach?

875
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:09,760
Pole vault over here?

876
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:14,989
How do you pole vault?

877
00:48:14,989 --> 00:48:24,530
Use the shovel on the rock.

878
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:39,760
Use the shovel on the rock.

879
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:47,739
Damn. Wow.

880
00:48:47,739 --> 00:48:49,739
Holy shit, that one had like 4000.

881
00:48:49,739 --> 00:49:05,230
Dig a hole behind you

882
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:08,750
so you don't get recoiled.

883
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:10,750
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

884
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:30,320
I'm back here.

885
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:37,219
That thing was huge.

886
00:49:37,219 --> 00:49:39,219
How do I use the pole vault?

887
00:49:39,219 --> 00:49:51,170
It has to be equipped?

888
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:56,159
Oh, hold it.

889
00:49:56,159 --> 00:50:00,639
Alright, nice. Here we go.

890
00:50:00,639 --> 00:50:03,650
Here we go.

891
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:10,179
Oh, I'll plant apple trees over here.

892
00:50:10,179 --> 00:50:13,760
Yeah, I'm gonna plant some trees here.

893
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:27,250
Okay. Apples. Plant.

894
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:31,090
Cool.

895
00:50:31,090 --> 00:50:33,389
And then we do

896
00:50:33,389 --> 00:50:35,389
how far apart do they have to be?

897
00:50:35,389 --> 00:50:37,389
Does it matter? How far apart can I do whatever?

898
00:50:37,389 --> 00:50:40,079
Will this work? Can I do it here?

899
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:45,119
I can do it right there, right?

900
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,119
It doesn't matter? It just does? Okay, cool.

901
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:55,170
I'm gonna have an apple garden.

902
00:50:55,170 --> 00:50:57,170
Just at least one space.

903
00:50:57,170 --> 00:51:07,260
Do I have to water them?

904
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:12,829
I would assume, right?

905
00:51:12,829 --> 00:51:20,699
Trees don't need water. Oh, okay.

906
00:51:20,699 --> 00:51:22,699
Am I gonna play Smite after this?

907
00:51:22,699 --> 00:51:27,309
That's something I haven't heard in a very, very, very long time.

908
00:51:27,309 --> 00:51:34,289
Dude, you're gonna play

909
00:51:34,289 --> 00:51:42,219
Smite after this?

910
00:51:42,219 --> 00:51:44,849
Alright, I'm gonna

911
00:51:44,849 --> 00:51:46,849
make, okay, I've got three apple trees.

912
00:51:46,849 --> 00:51:50,429
Oh shit, there's a lot of stuff over here.

913
00:51:50,429 --> 00:51:53,489
Crap. I already have one of those

914
00:51:53,489 --> 00:51:58,989
though. I don't even want it.

915
00:51:58,989 --> 00:52:01,489
That's a huge fish. Huge fish.

916
00:52:01,489 --> 00:52:04,539
I don't have any money.

917
00:52:04,539 --> 00:52:07,360
I gotta get that space upgrade.

918
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,360
Alright, do I have enough for the upgrade?

919
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:13,260
I think I do. It's 5,000, right?

920
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:23,550
Come on. Come on. 500.

921
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:31,659
Ugh. What do I need to get there?

922
00:52:31,659 --> 00:52:34,929
I need...

923
00:52:34,929 --> 00:52:38,179
That's an easy one. Just take a...

924
00:52:38,179 --> 00:52:40,179
Just take a picture. Alright, just take any photo.

925
00:52:40,179 --> 00:52:51,059
Alright, I'm gonna go get the inventory upgrade.

926
00:52:51,059 --> 00:52:59,309
That's the plan.

927
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:11,199
Boomer selfie.

928
00:53:11,199 --> 00:53:13,199
I don't know why I'm laughing at that because I don't even know what that means.

929
00:53:13,199 --> 00:53:16,400
Take the bulletin board. What's this?

930
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,639
Free stuff tomorrow only at Tom Nook's house.

931
00:53:18,639 --> 00:53:20,639
Just go in. It's fine. Take anything.

932
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:22,639
Sign Tom Nook.

933
00:53:22,639 --> 00:53:24,639
Well, that's...

934
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:28,289
That's still valid?

935
00:53:28,289 --> 00:53:42,500
Is it still open?

936
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:47,679
5,000 miles.

937
00:53:47,679 --> 00:53:49,679
A pocket organization guide.

938
00:53:49,679 --> 00:53:51,860
I will take it.

939
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:56,269
Thank you.

940
00:53:56,269 --> 00:53:58,269
Are we actually on 30 minute slow mode? Why?

941
00:53:58,269 --> 00:54:00,579
We should not be on

942
00:54:00,579 --> 00:54:04,989
30 minute slow mode.

943
00:54:04,989 --> 00:54:06,989
I don't want to be on 30 minute slow mode.

944
00:54:06,989 --> 00:54:12,690
I learned some tricks for organizing

945
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:14,690
my belongings. I can carry a bit more stuff.

946
00:54:14,690 --> 00:54:16,989
Holy shit, that's

947
00:54:16,989 --> 00:54:20,000
so much better.

948
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,010
I can actually breathe.

949
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:25,010
Is it an almond or Wi-Fi?

950
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:35,119
It's Wi-Fi.

951
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:43,119
Wait, it was actually on.

952
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:45,940
Alright, now I have some room for this shit.

953
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:47,940
And then I want to store

954
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:51,969
the other things.

955
00:54:51,969 --> 00:54:57,730
I need storage.

956
00:54:57,730 --> 00:55:05,900
What do I do? Put it back.

957
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:08,460
You have the ability

958
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:10,460
to speak now and you want it taken away

959
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:12,460
from you? Why do you want that?

960
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:17,199
You don't actually want that.

961
00:55:17,199 --> 00:55:19,199
You sound like a cam girl

962
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:22,980
when she reads messages.

963
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:24,980
What the fuck does that even mean?

964
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:34,190
What?

965
00:55:34,190 --> 00:55:37,139
I don't even know what that means.

966
00:55:37,139 --> 00:55:39,820
What are you talking about?

967
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:44,750
True though, that's true.

968
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:47,440
What the fuck

969
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:50,190
are you talking about?

970
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:52,190
I don't even know what that reference is.

971
00:55:52,190 --> 00:55:55,710
I know what

972
00:55:55,710 --> 00:55:57,710
it is. I don't know what

973
00:55:57,710 --> 00:56:02,510
what did I say?

974
00:56:02,510 --> 00:56:19,980
It's so true. It's true. What are you talking about?

975
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:29,010
I think it's just how people read messages

976
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:34,449
in general. I got dressed for this shit.

977
00:56:34,449 --> 00:56:36,820
What does that mean?

978
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:41,679
Earlier, I don't want to use

979
00:56:41,679 --> 00:56:47,059
face cam.

980
00:56:47,059 --> 00:56:49,619
Look at me.

981
00:56:49,619 --> 00:56:53,260
Naked frame. Play Smite.

982
00:56:53,260 --> 00:57:01,260
The people have spoken. The people

983
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:03,260
have spoken. Play Nancy Drew

984
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:05,260
while you swallow a disc

985
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:07,260
of smite. Installation disc

986
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:20,000
one of four.

987
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
I didn't store my items.

988
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:28,139
Store your shit. I know, I'm being

989
00:57:28,139 --> 00:57:30,139
distracted by people saying

990
00:57:30,139 --> 00:57:32,139
things about me. They're saying

991
00:57:32,139 --> 00:57:34,449
things about me.

992
00:57:34,449 --> 00:57:41,360
They're saying things about me.

993
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:45,579
Store this. Store this.

994
00:57:45,579 --> 00:57:51,070
Store the clay. Store the stones.

995
00:57:51,070 --> 00:57:55,409
Stones. Yes, I'll

996
00:57:55,409 --> 00:57:59,940
get the stones.

997
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:03,840
Yes, my lord, I will.

998
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:14,019
I will get the stones.

999
00:58:14,019 --> 00:58:25,409
Do I need any of this other shit? Can you

1000
00:58:25,409 --> 00:58:27,409
imagine

1001
00:58:27,409 --> 00:58:29,409
not seeing a bunch of movies and not

1002
00:58:29,409 --> 00:58:31,409
knowing what the fifth element is? Imagine

1003
00:58:31,409 --> 00:58:33,409
not seeing a bunch of movies. You took the Universal

1004
00:58:33,409 --> 00:58:35,409
fucking Studios quiz. You don't

1005
00:58:35,409 --> 00:58:48,590
know movies? Imagine?

1006
00:58:48,590 --> 00:58:54,539
It's a great movie. All right, so

1007
00:58:54,539 --> 00:58:58,130
I need to go on

1008
00:58:58,130 --> 00:59:01,260
a flash. I need to watch

1009
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:03,260
more movies. German walk.

1010
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:10,500
What's a stack of

1011
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:13,630
fruits? It's one stack of fruits.

1012
00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:15,630
10, 20, 30.

1013
00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:21,460
Oh, look at those up

1014
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:24,139
there. Rock

1015
00:59:24,139 --> 00:59:30,019
40. I feel like that's different from the last

1016
00:59:30,019 --> 00:59:33,150
one. All right, here's somebody.

1017
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:35,150
This is a strategy, right? You do one behind

1018
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:37,150
you so you can't be bounced back. Is this the strategy?

1019
00:59:37,150 --> 00:59:39,519
It is.

1020
00:59:39,519 --> 00:59:45,280
Oh, you fucking can't be serious.

1021
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:56,159
I got some iron, though.

1022
00:59:56,159 --> 01:00:04,659
Watched it.

1023
01:00:04,659 --> 01:00:06,659
What's over here? Lots of stuff.

1024
01:00:06,659 --> 01:00:11,199
No, stop it. I want to just shake it.

1025
01:00:11,199 --> 01:00:13,630
Two diagonally by two holes.

1026
01:00:13,630 --> 01:00:21,119
Okay.

1027
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:24,699
Whole back seating. I distinctly

1028
01:00:24,699 --> 01:00:26,699
saw three peaches drop

1029
01:00:26,699 --> 01:00:28,699
and only one of them was collectible.

1030
01:00:28,699 --> 01:00:36,690
What's that?

1031
01:00:36,690 --> 01:00:38,929
I dug up a fossil.

1032
01:00:38,929 --> 01:00:42,000
Oh, cool.

1033
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:52,500
Any fish in here? This is worth 20.

1034
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:56,909
That's rare. Everything is rare

1035
01:00:56,909 --> 01:01:02,739
in this game, don't you know? I make a lot of money

1036
01:01:02,739 --> 01:01:14,380
from peaches. It's worth $90,000.

1037
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:19,570
What?

1038
01:01:19,570 --> 01:01:29,170
That's pretty cool. This time

1039
01:01:29,170 --> 01:01:35,300
I'm ready. Got you.

1040
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:37,300
Don't touch it.

1041
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:39,300
I caught a tarantula. The situation just got hairy.

1042
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:44,099
Let's get some more fish

1043
01:01:44,099 --> 01:01:46,099
to bring to the guy.

1044
01:01:46,099 --> 01:02:07,199
I caught a loach

1045
01:02:07,199 --> 01:02:13,090
looking at me with reproach.

1046
01:02:13,090 --> 01:02:15,329
What about this one?

1047
01:02:15,329 --> 01:02:17,329
What else is on this little island?

1048
01:02:17,329 --> 01:02:21,869
Two more spots. Nice.

1049
01:02:21,869 --> 01:02:25,519
Fossil.

1050
01:02:25,519 --> 01:02:27,820
Fossil and

1051
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:34,099
two more fossils.

1052
01:02:34,099 --> 01:02:36,099
This game is terrible for joke

1053
01:02:36,099 --> 01:02:40,190
stunks.

1054
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:43,139
Yeah, but we've got to remember

1055
01:02:43,139 --> 01:02:45,570
sometimes it's not about the jokes.

1056
01:02:45,570 --> 01:02:49,019
Sometimes it's about shaking trees.

1057
01:02:49,019 --> 01:02:51,519
Picking up apples on the ground.

1058
01:02:51,519 --> 01:02:53,820
Sometimes it's not about the jokes.

1059
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:57,150
Sometimes it's about sending

1060
01:02:57,150 --> 01:02:59,710
a message.

1061
01:02:59,710 --> 01:03:01,710
Why did you make me do that?

1062
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:04,340
It's always about the jokes.

1063
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:06,340
It's not always about the jokes. Sometimes it's about

1064
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:08,340
just, it's not always

1065
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:13,389
about the joke. Look, if it was only

1066
01:03:13,389 --> 01:03:15,389
joke, I could get joke exhaustion.

1067
01:03:15,389 --> 01:03:30,050
Alright, well I got a bunch of stuff.

1068
01:03:30,050 --> 01:03:32,050
Let's go talk to the, uh, wait.

1069
01:03:32,050 --> 01:03:42,289
Is he sentient rock?

1070
01:03:42,289 --> 01:03:55,969
Wouldn't that be something?

1071
01:03:55,969 --> 01:03:58,780
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1072
01:03:58,780 --> 01:04:00,780
No, no, no, no, no. Can you eat the grass?

1073
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:20,480
I'm going to blathers.

1074
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:22,480
Balloon present. Balloon present. Balloon alert.

1075
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:41,550
Attention streamer. I wasn't looking.

1076
01:04:41,550 --> 01:04:43,550
What's in it? Hopefully it's a fossil.

1077
01:04:43,550 --> 01:04:46,690
Bunch of clay. Eh, that's pretty good.

1078
01:04:46,690 --> 01:04:49,059
I only had one.

1079
01:04:49,059 --> 01:05:10,030
Rare clay? Alright blathers

1080
01:05:10,030 --> 01:05:12,030
I got some fossils for you.

1081
01:05:12,030 --> 01:05:14,909
I do.

1082
01:05:14,909 --> 01:05:22,239
Take this. Does he dust it off?

1083
01:05:22,239 --> 01:05:24,239
Let me know that this is a fossil.

1084
01:05:24,239 --> 01:05:26,239
Incredible. Wonderful. Remarkable. My intuition

1085
01:05:26,239 --> 01:05:28,239
was impeccable. There are fossils

1086
01:05:28,239 --> 01:05:30,610
on this island. Back to

1087
01:05:30,610 --> 01:05:32,610
the matter at Wing. I must assess your

1088
01:05:32,610 --> 01:05:34,610
fabulous find. Let me see here. Hmm.

1089
01:05:34,610 --> 01:05:38,190
I can declare

1090
01:05:38,190 --> 01:05:40,190
this to be a left

1091
01:05:40,190 --> 01:05:44,159
Magello slide. My feathers.

1092
01:05:44,159 --> 01:05:46,159
What a fabulous fossil. This left

1093
01:05:46,159 --> 01:05:48,159
Magello side would be a sizable

1094
01:05:48,159 --> 01:05:50,159
step toward opening the museum.

1095
01:05:50,159 --> 01:05:52,460
I wonder, would you perhaps consider donating this

1096
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:54,460
to the cause?

1097
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:58,940
Yes. I'll add this to the collection.

1098
01:05:58,940 --> 01:06:00,940
I wouldn't add your light shapes to my collection.

1099
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:03,250
I never thought I'd

1100
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:05,250
say I'd lay eyes on this bunch of

1101
01:06:05,250 --> 01:06:07,250
preserved left Magello

1102
01:06:07,250 --> 01:06:09,250
side.

1103
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:11,420
Dear me, I might have to give you a short

1104
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:13,420
presentation on the topic. Ah, no.

1105
01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:16,539
Uh, sure.

1106
01:06:16,539 --> 01:06:19,099
Wonderful.

1107
01:06:19,099 --> 01:06:21,099
It's fascinating stuff. I assure you. Now, where to begin?

1108
01:06:21,099 --> 01:06:23,789
The Megalosaurus

1109
01:06:23,789 --> 01:06:25,789
was a relative of the deer that

1110
01:06:25,789 --> 01:06:27,789
lived during the Ice Age, long after

1111
01:06:27,789 --> 01:06:29,789
the dinosaurs. It was also known as

1112
01:06:29,789 --> 01:06:31,789
Megaloceros giganteos,

1113
01:06:31,789 --> 01:06:33,789
which just means deer with

1114
01:06:33,789 --> 01:06:35,789
large horns. True to their name,

1115
01:06:35,789 --> 01:06:37,789
they were deer with antlers spanning roughly 10

1116
01:06:37,789 --> 01:06:40,989
feet across. Imagine the majesty.

1117
01:06:40,989 --> 01:06:42,989
While smaller than many dinosaurs, they were

1118
01:06:42,989 --> 01:06:44,989
nonetheless a very charismatic example of

1119
01:06:44,989 --> 01:06:48,059
megafauna. And that is what I have to say

1120
01:06:48,059 --> 01:06:50,059
about that. Anywho, I'll take it.

1121
01:06:50,059 --> 01:06:52,880
He's doing it on purpose.

1122
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,880
He has to be doing it on purpose.

1123
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:59,679
He has to be.

1124
01:06:59,679 --> 01:07:04,159
Oh, Megalosaurus.

1125
01:07:04,159 --> 01:07:06,159
Only a specialist can appraise a newly

1126
01:07:06,159 --> 01:07:10,190
discovered fossil.

1127
01:07:10,190 --> 01:07:12,750
Whether you choose to donate is up to

1128
01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:14,750
you. I will assess it.

1129
01:07:14,750 --> 01:07:18,139
Okay.

1130
01:07:18,139 --> 01:07:26,260
What about this bug?

1131
01:07:26,260 --> 01:07:29,309
A tarantula.

1132
01:07:29,309 --> 01:07:32,940
Let's learn. In that case,

1133
01:07:32,940 --> 01:07:34,940
as spiders go, the tarantula is said to

1134
01:07:34,940 --> 01:07:36,940
be quite docile. But have you ever seen

1135
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:38,940
such foul fuzziness?

1136
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:44,829
They're barbed, I tell you.

1137
01:07:44,829 --> 01:07:46,829
These awful arachnids let

1138
01:07:46,829 --> 01:07:48,829
loose their spiky, itchy hairs to protect themselves

1139
01:07:48,829 --> 01:07:50,829
from predators. But seeing how

1140
01:07:50,829 --> 01:07:52,829
tarantulas also prey on frogs, mice, and even

1141
01:07:52,829 --> 01:07:54,829
birds, one must ask,

1142
01:07:54,829 --> 01:07:57,199
who needs protecting from whom?

1143
01:07:57,199 --> 01:07:59,380
Who, indeed?

1144
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:01,619
Anywho, my serious thanks.

1145
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:03,619
They eat frogs. That's what they do. That's fucked up.

1146
01:08:03,619 --> 01:08:18,060
I got this thing. A loach.

1147
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:21,579
I don't care.

1148
01:08:21,579 --> 01:08:23,579
So hold on, the fossil that I dug up, that

1149
01:08:23,579 --> 01:08:25,579
the Magellan stone,

1150
01:08:25,579 --> 01:08:27,579
whatever it was called,

1151
01:08:27,579 --> 01:08:29,579
can I now sell that?

1152
01:08:29,579 --> 01:08:32,529
I don't have to give it to him anymore?

1153
01:08:32,529 --> 01:08:49,939
You can sell it off and get it again.

1154
01:08:49,939 --> 01:08:51,939
Place it.

1155
01:08:51,939 --> 01:08:55,970
Place the fossil.

1156
01:08:55,970 --> 01:09:02,670
He's donating. Why do you have

1157
01:09:02,670 --> 01:09:04,909
Why do I place it?

1158
01:09:04,909 --> 01:09:11,760
Place it, like, up here?

1159
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:14,449
Outside. On the ground?

1160
01:09:14,449 --> 01:09:24,670
I already donated it.

1161
01:09:24,670 --> 01:09:26,670
I keep giving him fossils, but I couldn't select it.

1162
01:09:26,670 --> 01:09:30,960
If you get it again. No, you did not.

1163
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:32,960
What?

1164
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,960
All the fossils were grayed out when I just talked to him.

1165
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:40,659
What are you talking about?

1166
01:09:40,659 --> 01:09:42,659
Wait, he has to assess the fossil first, then you can donate it.

1167
01:09:42,659 --> 01:09:53,539
Assess fossils? Okay.

1168
01:09:55,710 --> 01:09:58,909
Here, look at this.

1169
01:09:58,909 --> 01:10:01,859
Take them both. Sometimes it's automatically

1170
01:10:01,859 --> 01:10:03,859
donated.

1171
01:10:03,859 --> 01:10:08,340
What do we got?

1172
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:15,060
These are rare fossils.

1173
01:10:15,060 --> 01:10:27,260
What are they? What are they?

1174
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:35,579
T-Rex skull. How did I bring this in here?

1175
01:10:35,579 --> 01:10:38,020
T-Rex skull?

1176
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:40,640
I never thought I'd say it. Wait a minute.

1177
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:42,640
Hear me, I might give you a short presentation.

1178
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:44,640
How much can I sell a T-Rex skull for?

1179
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:49,060
I know what a T-Rex is.

1180
01:10:49,060 --> 01:10:51,060
I'm busy.

1181
01:10:51,060 --> 01:10:57,310
Don't put it outside.

1182
01:10:57,310 --> 01:10:59,310
Hold on. Put it outside?

1183
01:10:59,310 --> 01:11:01,310
Wait, it's a hundred thousand bells

1184
01:11:01,310 --> 01:11:11,680
to sell it?

1185
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:20,770
Place it down.

1186
01:11:20,770 --> 01:11:24,590
Where is it?

1187
01:11:24,590 --> 01:11:27,729
Oh.

1188
01:11:27,729 --> 01:11:29,729
It doesn't show up on the ground.

1189
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:47,460
No, I know it's not the right one.

1190
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:50,340
Alright, this is the Archaopteryx.

1191
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:53,539
Archaopteryx.

1192
01:11:53,539 --> 01:11:55,840
Archaopteryx.

1193
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:58,020
Archaopteryx.

1194
01:11:58,020 --> 01:12:02,800
Take it.

1195
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,800
Could it be? It is an Archaopteryx.

1196
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:08,579
It's so preserved. Thank you.

1197
01:12:08,579 --> 01:12:11,260
What is this thing?

1198
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:13,260
A skull of a dinosaur. Cool.

1199
01:12:17,539 --> 01:12:21,100
I only need five more.

1200
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:23,100
So I need to give...

1201
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:32,770
Let's go back out and explore.

1202
01:12:32,770 --> 01:12:34,770
I still need to do your thing.

1203
01:12:34,770 --> 01:12:36,770
Hey, communicative parts.

1204
01:12:36,770 --> 01:12:38,770
Come out, wherever you are.

1205
01:12:38,770 --> 01:12:40,770
I'll answer what it is. It's like they've all clammed up all of a sudden.

1206
01:12:40,770 --> 01:12:44,289
Buried their heads in the sand.

1207
01:12:44,289 --> 01:12:49,340
Am I responding to him?

1208
01:12:49,340 --> 01:12:52,350
Right.

1209
01:12:52,350 --> 01:12:56,770
What am I typing this for?

1210
01:12:56,770 --> 01:13:06,859
Buried in the sand.

1211
01:13:06,859 --> 01:13:11,409
What was that?

1212
01:13:11,409 --> 01:13:14,420
Excuse me.

1213
01:13:14,420 --> 01:13:25,659
Communicator part.

1214
01:13:25,659 --> 01:13:29,119
Communicator part.

1215
01:13:29,119 --> 01:13:38,000
5G chip.

1216
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,460
And the others.

1217
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:45,680
The little water spouts.

1218
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:55,069
I need five, right?

1219
01:13:55,069 --> 01:14:00,829
The profit is infected with 5G.

1220
01:14:00,829 --> 01:14:03,579
No more.

1221
01:14:03,579 --> 01:14:11,140
Other beach, yeah.

1222
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:23,090
Go this way.

1223
01:14:23,090 --> 01:14:25,090
Okay, give me more of these clams.

1224
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:28,670
I want that fish too. Yeah, give me this fish.

1225
01:14:28,670 --> 01:14:41,279
Good guy.

1226
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:43,520
I caught a red snapper.

1227
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:55,489
It looks pretty dapper.

1228
01:14:55,489 --> 01:14:58,560
Come on, little water spout.

1229
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:06,220
No?

1230
01:15:06,220 --> 01:15:25,149
Come on.

1231
01:15:25,149 --> 01:15:43,569
Nothing.

1232
01:15:43,569 --> 01:15:50,909
Bug spotted.

1233
01:15:50,909 --> 01:15:52,909
That's okay.

1234
01:15:52,909 --> 01:15:54,909
Go get the bugs.

1235
01:15:54,909 --> 01:16:08,909
Bugs, bugs, bugs.

1236
01:16:08,909 --> 01:16:19,840
Hey, no bug?

1237
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:36,270
Hey, I see a tinted rock.

1238
01:16:36,270 --> 01:16:49,380
Come on.

1239
01:16:49,380 --> 01:17:16,050
Come on.

1240
01:17:16,050 --> 01:17:27,220
Get it. Here it comes.

1241
01:17:27,220 --> 01:17:29,220
That's going to float out right in front of him, really?

1242
01:17:29,220 --> 01:17:35,039
I fucking can't believe

1243
01:17:35,039 --> 01:17:37,470
that just happened.

1244
01:17:37,470 --> 01:17:39,710
My sweaty ass hand just hit the button.

1245
01:17:39,710 --> 01:17:41,710
It was there.

1246
01:17:41,710 --> 01:17:43,710
Again,

1247
01:17:43,710 --> 01:17:45,710
I'm going to say this again and I know people are going to be like,

1248
01:17:45,710 --> 01:17:47,710
I know here it comes again.

1249
01:17:47,710 --> 01:17:49,710
You can press every single switch button with your thumb.

1250
01:17:49,710 --> 01:17:51,949
Every single one.

1251
01:17:51,949 --> 01:17:53,949
Every single button on the switch controller

1252
01:17:53,949 --> 01:18:08,539
is going to be pressed with one thumb.

1253
01:18:08,539 --> 01:18:10,979
All right, bug on rock.

1254
01:18:10,979 --> 01:18:12,979
He's not using the pro controller.

1255
01:18:12,979 --> 01:18:19,180
I'm not a pro.

1256
01:18:19,180 --> 01:18:21,180
Where's this bug on rock, as you were describing down?

1257
01:18:21,180 --> 01:18:39,710
Hey, look at that.

1258
01:18:39,710 --> 01:18:44,000
Middle of the island on the big black rock.

1259
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:49,180
I'll get the net out preemptively.

1260
01:18:49,180 --> 01:18:51,180
Up left, big rock.

1261
01:18:51,180 --> 01:19:00,140
Up here? I don't see any bugs.

1262
01:19:00,140 --> 01:19:22,529
He's fishing in really weird spots.

1263
01:19:22,529 --> 01:19:32,699
It's right next to his turn.

1264
01:19:32,699 --> 01:19:34,699
North bug.

1265
01:19:34,699 --> 01:19:42,829
Bug on chair.

1266
01:19:42,829 --> 01:20:01,579
Of course he turns to the left the second I do that shit.

1267
01:20:01,579 --> 01:20:05,300
The horse mackerel, of course.

1268
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:10,100
The bug is behind you.

1269
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:12,460
Looking for another bug.

1270
01:20:12,460 --> 01:20:21,300
Found him. Bugs.

1271
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:23,300
Yes, I got a wharf roach.

1272
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:27,819
Wow.

1273
01:20:27,819 --> 01:20:38,109
Wow. Whoa.

1274
01:20:38,109 --> 01:20:41,699
That was nice. That's cool.

1275
01:20:41,699 --> 01:20:43,699
All right, one more and then we're going to go donate.

1276
01:20:58,670 --> 01:21:01,300
Yes. Yes, I finally got it.

1277
01:21:01,300 --> 01:21:04,109
I got it. I finally got it.

1278
01:21:04,109 --> 01:21:06,609
Thank God it took so long.

1279
01:21:06,609 --> 01:21:09,810
That took so long.

1280
01:21:09,810 --> 01:21:11,810
Yes.

1281
01:21:11,810 --> 01:21:28,579
Yes.

1282
01:21:28,579 --> 01:21:30,579
Oh, I'm never going to delete that. That's going to stay there forever.

1283
01:21:30,579 --> 01:21:39,340
How do I get up there?

1284
01:21:39,340 --> 01:21:51,489
New sub zone.

1285
01:21:51,489 --> 01:22:01,859
Big guy.

1286
01:22:01,859 --> 01:22:05,180
Come back. Put the pole in your

1287
01:22:05,180 --> 01:22:08,640
pool ring.

1288
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:16,899
I knew you could do that.

1289
01:22:16,899 --> 01:22:38,079
All right, let's go give Donald Duck his

1290
01:22:38,079 --> 01:22:52,539
communicator parts. My pockets are full.

1291
01:22:52,539 --> 01:23:01,380
Uh oh. Drop it.

1292
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:03,380
Drop the fucking sea snail.

1293
01:23:03,380 --> 01:23:05,550
I don't even want this thing.

1294
01:23:05,550 --> 01:23:09,710
Uh oh.

1295
01:23:09,710 --> 01:23:12,720
Come on.

1296
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:14,720
Uh oh. I want to say it, but I

1297
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:16,720
don't want to.

1298
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:19,859
Do you know what I mean? I want to say it,

1299
01:23:19,859 --> 01:23:21,859
but I don't want to. I don't even want to.

1300
01:23:21,859 --> 01:23:23,859
Uh oh.

1301
01:23:23,859 --> 01:23:25,859
I don't know why I feel like saying this

1302
01:23:25,859 --> 01:23:27,859
right now. I hate that word.

1303
01:23:27,859 --> 01:23:29,859
The way that he says it,

1304
01:23:29,859 --> 01:23:31,859
it's fucked up.

1305
01:23:31,859 --> 01:23:37,939
It's fucking me up.

1306
01:23:37,939 --> 01:23:39,939
What did I just bury?

1307
01:23:39,939 --> 01:23:42,539
I'm begging you.

1308
01:23:42,539 --> 01:23:46,689
I'm going to turn off the mic

1309
01:23:46,689 --> 01:23:48,989
and I'm going to do it for me.

1310
01:23:48,989 --> 01:23:50,989
I had to do that for me.

1311
01:23:50,989 --> 01:23:57,840
I don't want this.

1312
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:01,100
It was a private one.

1313
01:24:01,100 --> 01:24:23,060
Please watch it.

1314
01:24:23,060 --> 01:24:25,060
I've seen the video by now.

1315
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:27,229
I don't live under a rock.

1316
01:24:27,229 --> 01:24:29,229
I've seen it.

1317
01:24:29,229 --> 01:24:31,229
Talk to Blathers.

1318
01:24:31,229 --> 01:24:37,630
He watches it every day.

1319
01:24:37,630 --> 01:24:57,409
I've got something for you to

1320
01:24:57,409 --> 01:25:00,350
assume.

1321
01:25:00,350 --> 01:25:02,350
I have something that I want you to

1322
01:25:02,350 --> 01:25:06,130
assume.

1323
01:25:06,130 --> 01:25:12,979
Poop guy not in chat

1324
01:25:12,979 --> 01:25:14,979
anymore. No, he's not. He got like banned.

1325
01:25:14,979 --> 01:25:17,600
Like the Poopoo BLT

1326
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:19,600
guy is gone. I don't think you'll be seeing

1327
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:22,800
him in chat again. Oh, it's a

1328
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,800
Megasero torso.

1329
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:26,979
You can have it.

1330
01:25:26,979 --> 01:25:46,180
Listen to the description, please.

1331
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:51,869
I don't know.

1332
01:25:51,869 --> 01:25:53,869
I wonder if you have anything else. Do I? I don't think I do.

1333
01:25:53,869 --> 01:25:56,880
I actually, yeah,

1334
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:59,380
I do. I got bugs and shit.

1335
01:25:59,380 --> 01:26:01,619
Fucking roach.

1336
01:26:01,619 --> 01:26:06,979
Tell me about the roach.

1337
01:26:06,979 --> 01:26:08,979
I see, in that case.

1338
01:26:08,979 --> 01:26:10,979
Wharf roach is an omnivore, which is merely a polite way of

1339
01:26:10,979 --> 01:26:12,979
saying it will eat almost anything.

1340
01:26:12,979 --> 01:26:15,920
This skittering scavenger

1341
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:17,920
and its uncouth

1342
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:19,920
appetite help keep beaches clean.

1343
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:21,920
It's said.

1344
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:23,920
I dare say their long antennae and bulging

1345
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:25,920
eyes burn my stomach.

1346
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:27,920
Unappetizing indeed.

1347
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:29,920
What is the Poopoo bit? Somebody came in here

1348
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:31,920
and said that they were eating a BLT

1349
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:33,920
shit sandwich or something and they

1350
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:35,920
made everybody lose their fucking minds.

1351
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:37,920
Chat went nuts. I went nuts. It was a huge

1352
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:40,739
problem. We're calling it

1353
01:26:40,739 --> 01:26:42,739
the BLT shit sandwich scenario

1354
01:26:42,739 --> 01:26:44,739
of fucking 2020.

1355
01:26:44,739 --> 01:27:00,029
Can I do multiple donations?

1356
01:27:00,029 --> 01:27:04,699
I can't do multiple donations at the same time.

1357
01:27:04,699 --> 01:27:09,380
This is a horse mackerel.

1358
01:27:09,380 --> 01:27:13,470
Do you want some facts?

1359
01:27:13,470 --> 01:27:16,930
I almost have enough for the museum.

1360
01:27:16,930 --> 01:27:19,359
Three more? Two more?

1361
01:27:19,359 --> 01:27:24,340
And

1362
01:27:24,340 --> 01:27:27,729
ooh, this big guy. Red snapper.

1363
01:27:27,729 --> 01:27:34,050
We'll get the facts on the snapper.

1364
01:27:34,050 --> 01:27:36,050
Give us some facts. Hit us with the facts.

1365
01:27:36,050 --> 01:27:39,250
Red snapper is the common name of dozens of

1366
01:27:39,250 --> 01:27:41,250
fish species and I wonder why it's so popular.

1367
01:27:41,250 --> 01:27:43,250
There's so many types of fish that are

1368
01:27:43,250 --> 01:27:45,250
both a shade of red and have a tendency to

1369
01:27:45,250 --> 01:27:48,319
snap? Were there no other names?

1370
01:27:48,319 --> 01:27:50,319
What about...

1371
01:27:50,319 --> 01:27:52,319
What about...

1372
01:27:52,319 --> 01:27:54,319
What about...

1373
01:27:54,319 --> 01:27:56,500
Uh, garnet...

1374
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:58,859
Brasper? Fuse? Pinscher?

1375
01:27:58,859 --> 01:28:02,899
There you have it. Fascinating

1376
01:28:02,899 --> 01:28:06,979
stuff.

1377
01:28:06,979 --> 01:28:08,979
Once the museum is complete, there you go.

1378
01:28:08,979 --> 01:28:13,199
One more donation.

1379
01:28:13,199 --> 01:28:21,380
And that's it. The crack stream.

1380
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:24,640
They're all crack streams.

1381
01:28:24,640 --> 01:28:27,390
Hey, uh,

1382
01:28:27,390 --> 01:28:35,779
look what I did.

1383
01:28:35,779 --> 01:28:41,779
I'm gonna click on it.

1384
01:28:41,779 --> 01:28:43,779
Yeah, sure.

1385
01:28:43,779 --> 01:28:55,149
There it is.

1386
01:28:55,149 --> 01:28:57,149
And you don't think

1387
01:28:57,149 --> 01:28:59,149
that person should have

1388
01:28:59,149 --> 01:29:01,149
received the 25 minute timeout.

1389
01:29:01,149 --> 01:29:03,149
For something like that.

1390
01:29:03,149 --> 01:29:05,149
And I'm the bad guy?

1391
01:29:05,149 --> 01:29:08,100
I'm the bad guy?

1392
01:29:08,100 --> 01:29:10,100
You don't think that that deserves

1393
01:29:10,100 --> 01:29:12,100
like a 20 minute fucking timeout?

1394
01:29:12,100 --> 01:29:14,100
Like, just relax and go over your life

1395
01:29:14,100 --> 01:29:25,170
for a little bit?

1396
01:29:25,170 --> 01:29:27,170
Alright, pieces of cram back in here. Let's see if this thing can send a message.

1397
01:29:27,170 --> 01:29:30,750
Hi there crew, it's me.

1398
01:29:30,750 --> 01:29:32,750
Your brother from another

1399
01:29:32,750 --> 01:29:34,750
rudder.

1400
01:29:34,750 --> 01:29:36,750
So, listen. It happened again. Can you swing by

1401
01:29:36,750 --> 01:29:38,750
to pick me up? Send me my coordinates now.

1402
01:29:38,750 --> 01:29:40,750
Gulliver. Over and out.

1403
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:44,899
That should do it.

1404
01:29:44,899 --> 01:29:46,899
You're the best. Thanks for all your help. I promised to return the favor.

1405
01:29:46,899 --> 01:29:48,899
Make sure to check your mail in a few days.

1406
01:29:48,899 --> 01:29:50,899
I'm gonna send you something that'll knock your flippers up.

1407
01:29:50,899 --> 01:30:03,699
Look at this dude.

1408
01:30:03,699 --> 01:30:05,699
Fireman. Yeah.

1409
01:30:05,699 --> 01:30:08,899
Fireman's in a lot of games.

1410
01:30:08,899 --> 01:30:10,899
Nothing to do now but pace back and forth the next few hours.

1411
01:30:10,899 --> 01:30:13,970
I'm gonna play Doom Eternal.

1412
01:30:13,970 --> 01:30:19,579
I don't know, maybe.

1413
01:30:19,579 --> 01:30:21,579
I had a choice to play Doom

1414
01:30:21,579 --> 01:30:23,579
or this and I chose this.

1415
01:30:23,579 --> 01:30:34,529
Wait, I still have

1416
01:30:34,529 --> 01:30:38,109
two more Gulliver requests?

1417
01:30:38,109 --> 01:30:41,439
What about Resident Evil 3?

1418
01:30:41,439 --> 01:30:43,810
Absolutely. Without question,

1419
01:30:43,810 --> 01:30:45,810
I will play Resident Evil 3. Resident Evil 2 Remake was

1420
01:30:45,810 --> 01:30:47,810
my favorite game of last year so I will absolutely.

1421
01:30:47,810 --> 01:30:54,779
Alright, so I got yours.

1422
01:30:54,779 --> 01:30:56,779
Yours only said a few days.

1423
01:30:56,779 --> 01:30:58,779
I need one more

1424
01:30:58,779 --> 01:31:01,729
thing to donate. Which, let's see.

1425
01:31:01,729 --> 01:31:03,729
I don't really have very much.

1426
01:31:03,729 --> 01:31:06,930
Let's go sell these peaches.

1427
01:31:06,930 --> 01:31:17,939
Let's go sell all this crap.

1428
01:31:17,939 --> 01:31:20,369
What about Half-Life Alyx? I can't

1429
01:31:20,369 --> 01:31:22,739
do it. I can't do it right now.

1430
01:31:22,739 --> 01:31:26,130
Not only am I moving

1431
01:31:26,130 --> 01:31:28,130
I still have this

1432
01:31:28,130 --> 01:31:30,130
fucking chest and back problem.

1433
01:31:30,130 --> 01:31:32,130
I'm not gonna be able to play that at launch.

1434
01:31:32,130 --> 01:31:41,340
He's moving? Alright.

1435
01:31:41,340 --> 01:31:43,340
I forgot, like, every hour there's another, like, new

1436
01:31:43,340 --> 01:31:45,340
thousand people. I forget that sometimes.

1437
01:31:45,340 --> 01:31:47,340
Um, yes.

1438
01:31:47,340 --> 01:31:49,520
Yes. Uh, staying in Vegas.

1439
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:52,850
Staying in Las Vegas.

1440
01:31:52,850 --> 01:31:54,850
Let me get the hashtag

1441
01:31:54,850 --> 01:31:56,850
What the fuck is he talking about? Why is he moving?

1442
01:31:56,850 --> 01:32:01,260
Look what they've done.

1443
01:32:01,260 --> 01:32:05,939
Uh, yeah, sometimes

1444
01:32:05,939 --> 01:32:07,939
I forget there's a lot of

1445
01:32:07,939 --> 01:32:09,939
If there's 5,000 people that

1446
01:32:09,939 --> 01:32:11,939
are here right now, that means

1447
01:32:11,939 --> 01:32:14,180
that 5 to 600

1448
01:32:14,180 --> 01:32:16,180
every 10 to 20 minutes are cycling

1449
01:32:16,180 --> 01:32:18,180
through. It's a very remarkable piece of data

1450
01:32:18,180 --> 01:32:22,270
if you ever get a chance to look at it.

1451
01:32:22,270 --> 01:32:31,939
Sell all this stuff. I'm gonna make some money

1452
01:32:31,939 --> 01:32:34,109
here, right? With clams.

1453
01:32:34,109 --> 01:32:36,109
Zelda. Kauris.

1454
01:32:36,109 --> 01:32:39,500
Very remarkable data. LOL

1455
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:41,500
Who the fuck is this guy?

1456
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:46,050
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1457
01:32:46,050 --> 01:32:50,270
Hey! Look at me!

1458
01:32:50,270 --> 01:32:53,659
Yadadadadada!

1459
01:32:53,659 --> 01:32:55,659
Sorry. I got a little

1460
01:32:55,659 --> 01:32:57,659
smart there. Let me, like, back it up a little.

1461
01:32:57,659 --> 01:33:04,510
Sorry. That's what I meant to say.

1462
01:33:04,510 --> 01:33:06,880
Sorry.

1463
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:10,079
What is this one?

1464
01:33:10,079 --> 01:33:12,960
Got it. What is this one?

1465
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:16,289
What is it saying? What is this one saying?

1466
01:33:16,289 --> 01:33:20,050
Got it. Got it. I can't hear it. Got it.

1467
01:33:20,050 --> 01:33:22,989
Got it. Got it. Got it.

1468
01:33:22,989 --> 01:33:25,739
Got it. Got it.

1469
01:33:25,739 --> 01:33:28,050
Got it. Oh, right. From

1470
01:33:28,050 --> 01:33:34,380
WariWare. Okay. I really

1471
01:33:34,380 --> 01:33:36,380
should. Oh, this is, I'm so

1472
01:33:36,380 --> 01:33:38,939
happy I have this recorded. Because

1473
01:33:38,939 --> 01:33:41,500
randomly, I'm just gonna play that.

1474
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:43,680
And people are gonna think it was a real sneeze. And I'm not gonna

1475
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:45,680
be funny or anything. I'm just gonna be

1476
01:33:45,680 --> 01:33:47,680
sitting there going, like, I'll make noise beforehand too.

1477
01:33:47,680 --> 01:33:50,819
I'll be like, and done! I can buy these

1478
01:33:50,819 --> 01:33:52,989
from you for a total of

1479
01:33:52,989 --> 01:33:55,739
seven thousand...

1480
01:33:55,739 --> 01:33:58,800
God! Sorry. And then just keep

1481
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:02,380
going with my deck.

1482
01:34:02,380 --> 01:34:04,380
I'm gonna do that all the fucking time. Prepare.

1483
01:34:04,380 --> 01:34:07,649
And done. I can buy these from you. Seven

1484
01:34:07,649 --> 01:34:11,229
thousand bells is a lot. It sounds so

1485
01:34:11,229 --> 01:34:14,239
real. It was real. It was real.

1486
01:34:14,239 --> 01:34:17,060
Two, three in a row.

1487
01:34:17,060 --> 01:34:25,039
Okay. Here we go. Ready? I want

1488
01:34:25,039 --> 01:34:27,789
you guys to start writing. Like, what the fuck

1489
01:34:27,789 --> 01:34:30,220
is wrong with them? Like, that's too many in a row.

1490
01:34:30,220 --> 01:34:32,220
Like, dude, do you have allergies? Like, start writing

1491
01:34:32,220 --> 01:34:42,109
that. Hold on. Ready?

1492
01:34:42,109 --> 01:34:46,000
Ugh. God.

1493
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,930
Ugh. No, no, no.

1494
01:34:48,930 --> 01:34:53,010
Another one.

1495
01:34:53,010 --> 01:34:58,430
Fuck. How many is that in a row? Ah, my nose

1496
01:34:58,430 --> 01:35:00,430
is so tingly. It sucks.

1497
01:35:00,430 --> 01:35:03,420
You know when you get...

1498
01:35:03,420 --> 01:35:07,439
Geez. Oh, I think

1499
01:35:07,439 --> 01:35:09,439
the room is kind of

1500
01:35:09,439 --> 01:35:11,869
dusty.

1501
01:35:11,869 --> 01:35:14,050
The room is so fucking dusty.

1502
01:35:14,050 --> 01:35:17,819
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have opened up the

1503
01:35:17,819 --> 01:35:20,000
bag of flour in here. That was a mistake.

1504
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:29,520
What happens if you sneeze?

1505
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:31,520
Does anybody know what happens?

1506
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:33,520
Does anybody know what happens if you sneeze

1507
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:35,520
like ten times in a row?

1508
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:37,760
What happens if you sneeze like ten times

1509
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:40,449
in a row?

1510
01:35:47,359 --> 01:35:49,359
Twenty.

1511
01:35:53,359 --> 01:35:55,920
Ugh.

1512
01:35:55,920 --> 01:35:57,920
Ugh.

1513
01:35:57,920 --> 01:35:59,920
Fuck.

1514
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:02,159
Oh, no. Is that better anymore?

1515
01:36:02,159 --> 01:36:04,159
Ugh.

1516
01:36:04,159 --> 01:36:07,489
This is the most time I've sneezed in my

1517
01:36:07,489 --> 01:36:09,489
entire life.

1518
01:36:09,489 --> 01:36:14,590
Ugh. Okay. I think

1519
01:36:14,590 --> 01:36:18,109
they're gone. I think they're gone. I think that's it.

1520
01:36:18,109 --> 01:36:24,560
I don't think there are any more in here.

1521
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:28,460
Jesus. Okay.

1522
01:36:28,460 --> 01:36:31,409
So, what I was saying was

1523
01:36:31,409 --> 01:36:33,409
I saw the Star Wars movie and it

1524
01:36:33,409 --> 01:36:35,649
was fucking... I mean, it was okay.

1525
01:36:35,649 --> 01:36:38,130
If you...

1526
01:36:38,130 --> 01:36:40,130
Ugh.

1527
01:36:40,130 --> 01:36:42,130
Ugh.

1528
01:36:42,130 --> 01:36:44,130
Ugh.

1529
01:36:44,130 --> 01:36:51,229
Fuck.

1530
01:36:51,229 --> 01:36:56,289
I'm okay now, I think.

1531
01:36:56,289 --> 01:37:01,789
Star Wars movie. Very topical.

1532
01:37:01,789 --> 01:37:03,789
You lost 150 viewers. It's alright.

1533
01:37:03,789 --> 01:37:06,479
I'll be back tomorrow.

1534
01:37:06,479 --> 01:37:18,260
I'm a fucking psycho. I gotta relax.

1535
01:37:18,260 --> 01:37:22,220
Okay. What's next?

1536
01:37:22,220 --> 01:37:24,590
Am I out of stuff to do?

1537
01:37:24,590 --> 01:37:26,590
Oh, wait a minute.

1538
01:37:26,590 --> 01:37:28,590
I need one more fossil. One more.

1539
01:37:28,590 --> 01:37:34,670
Fish. And then the airport. Yeah.

1540
01:37:34,670 --> 01:37:36,909
Let me get this last fish

1541
01:37:36,909 --> 01:37:38,909
and then we can figure that out.

1542
01:37:38,909 --> 01:37:40,909
Where's my fishing rod? God, this game is

1543
01:37:40,909 --> 01:37:44,819
so good.

1544
01:37:44,819 --> 01:37:47,250
Alright, I took it off.

1545
01:37:47,250 --> 01:37:49,250
Can I... How do I put it on my thing?

1546
01:37:49,250 --> 01:37:53,659
Register.

1547
01:37:53,659 --> 01:38:04,670
That just sneezes were real?

1548
01:38:04,670 --> 01:38:08,130
Well, that's not worth anything.

1549
01:38:08,130 --> 01:38:10,130
Put a...

1550
01:38:10,130 --> 01:38:12,130
That old tire could be repurposed. I've got an idea for a DIY

1551
01:38:12,130 --> 01:38:14,130
project?

1552
01:38:14,130 --> 01:38:18,850
Wait. That's kind of cool.

1553
01:38:18,850 --> 01:38:31,069
Really? Be a fish I haven't seen.

1554
01:38:31,069 --> 01:38:37,090
No, I've already seen this.

1555
01:38:37,090 --> 01:38:55,579
I probably need to go this way

1556
01:38:55,579 --> 01:38:57,579
and go to the river.

1557
01:38:57,579 --> 01:39:02,829
I want a rare fish.

1558
01:39:02,829 --> 01:39:04,829
It's weird. He does that sometimes

1559
01:39:04,829 --> 01:39:06,829
when I'm watching the streams.

1560
01:39:06,829 --> 01:39:08,829
He does that fake Boston accent, almost like

1561
01:39:08,829 --> 01:39:10,829
he's pretending that he's from the area that he's

1562
01:39:10,829 --> 01:39:13,260
actually from.

1563
01:39:13,260 --> 01:39:15,260
Does anybody know why he's doing that?

1564
01:39:15,260 --> 01:39:39,380
Enter. Question mark.

1565
01:39:39,380 --> 01:39:41,380
Ooh, it's a flounder. I caught a dab.

1566
01:39:41,380 --> 01:39:45,090
Not bad. Name of the fish.

1567
01:39:45,090 --> 01:39:50,850
Well, there's the last thing to give to the

1568
01:39:50,850 --> 01:39:54,430
museum.

1569
01:39:54,430 --> 01:39:58,909
Looking for bugs? Okay, no bugs?

1570
01:39:58,909 --> 01:40:01,729
Alright, let's do the museum.

1571
01:40:01,729 --> 01:40:03,729
And then I'm going to do the airline ticket thing.

1572
01:40:03,729 --> 01:40:08,529
Actually, it's called a nose wipe.

1573
01:40:08,529 --> 01:40:10,529
Yeah, sorry. I misspoke.

1574
01:40:10,529 --> 01:40:25,949
Wait, did I do this one? Yeah, I did.

1575
01:40:25,949 --> 01:40:28,770
It's a pretty fucking cool looking house.

1576
01:40:28,770 --> 01:40:38,109
I wonder who's that is.

1577
01:40:38,109 --> 01:40:40,109
I don't know if you're nominating this for the worst joke

1578
01:40:40,109 --> 01:40:42,109
taking more than five minutes.

1579
01:40:42,109 --> 01:40:45,060
I see the title a little that way.

1580
01:40:45,060 --> 01:40:47,060
You don't think I can see what clips are being made?

1581
01:40:47,060 --> 01:40:51,279
I can see it over there.

1582
01:40:51,279 --> 01:41:01,180
Assess this.

1583
01:41:01,180 --> 01:41:03,420
Wait, I don't have any policies, do I?

1584
01:41:03,420 --> 01:41:06,109
I'd like to make a donation.

1585
01:41:06,109 --> 01:41:08,420
I'd like to make a donation.

1586
01:41:08,420 --> 01:41:10,420
And then the museum can

1587
01:41:10,420 --> 01:41:13,739
open.

1588
01:41:13,739 --> 01:41:17,260
Probably tomorrow.

1589
01:41:17,260 --> 01:41:19,260
This is a dab.

1590
01:41:19,260 --> 01:41:23,680
Actually, let's get some facts.

1591
01:41:23,680 --> 01:41:25,680
The dab is a flatfish that bears some

1592
01:41:25,680 --> 01:41:27,680
resemblance to the olive flounder.

1593
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:29,680
The olive flarden.

1594
01:41:29,680 --> 01:41:31,680
Though their mouths are different.

1595
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:33,680
Personally, I'm more really fascinated by each

1596
01:41:33,680 --> 01:41:35,680
fish's eye placement.

1597
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:37,680
The dab's eyes are both on its right side,

1598
01:41:37,680 --> 01:41:39,680
while the olive flounder's are on the left.

1599
01:41:39,680 --> 01:41:42,560
These fish spend

1600
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:44,560
lots of time lying on their sides in the sands.

1601
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:46,560
The odd eye placement makes some sense.

1602
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:48,560
But it's not going to be this creepy.

1603
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:50,560
Incredibly disturbing.

1604
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:52,560
Profoundly upsetting to fans.

1605
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:54,560
And there you have it.

1606
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:56,560
Grasping stuff. Bravo.

1607
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:58,560
Once the museum is complete, it should be displayed

1608
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:02,779
with the utmost dignity. I do believe this

1609
01:42:02,779 --> 01:42:04,779
means, yes, we have acquired the number as

1610
01:42:04,779 --> 01:42:06,779
specimens required. I'm fed as I am a loss

1611
01:42:06,779 --> 01:42:08,779
for words. Never would I have imagined

1612
01:42:08,779 --> 01:42:10,779
we could reach our donation goal

1613
01:42:10,779 --> 01:42:12,779
on this, my very first day on the island.

1614
01:42:12,779 --> 01:42:14,779
The generosity that made this possible,

1615
01:42:14,779 --> 01:42:16,779
the passion I am humbled by, the spirit

1616
01:42:16,779 --> 01:42:18,779
of Salt-Bressed

1617
01:42:18,779 --> 01:42:21,090
Mountain.

1618
01:42:21,090 --> 01:42:23,090
Now we can submit our application to build a proper museum.

1619
01:42:23,090 --> 01:42:25,090
Oh, I'm, I'm, I must

1620
01:42:25,090 --> 01:42:27,090
make haste. I gotta prepare all this shit,

1621
01:42:27,090 --> 01:42:29,090
dude. I gotta, there's an opening that I gotta

1622
01:42:29,090 --> 01:42:31,090
be ready to open tomorrow. There's so much to do. Let's go.

1623
01:42:31,090 --> 01:42:37,739
Thank you so much, Jeremy.

1624
01:42:37,739 --> 01:42:46,050
All right. Done. Done.

1625
01:42:46,050 --> 01:42:48,220
Both tasks completed.

1626
01:42:48,220 --> 01:42:50,659
In record time.

1627
01:42:50,659 --> 01:42:52,659
Now we go to the airport.

1628
01:42:52,659 --> 01:42:57,460
Holy shit, he's chasing me!

1629
01:42:57,460 --> 01:42:59,890
Oh, oh!

1630
01:42:59,890 --> 01:43:02,060
What do I do? How do I? Okay, I'm gonna turn around.

1631
01:43:02,060 --> 01:43:04,060
Phoebe, do something! Phoebe!

1632
01:43:04,060 --> 01:43:10,079
Phoebe, do you have any? Get the fuck out of

1633
01:43:10,079 --> 01:43:12,079
here. That was bait the whole time. I had

1634
01:43:12,079 --> 01:43:16,560
confidence the entire time. Now I'm gonna

1635
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:19,380
sell this little fuck.

1636
01:43:19,380 --> 01:43:28,020
It's mean. Wait, can I just have,

1637
01:43:28,020 --> 01:43:40,430
what if I just keep it in my house?

1638
01:43:40,430 --> 01:43:46,130
I have a pet spider now. Can I play?

1639
01:43:46,130 --> 01:43:48,130
Oh my god, it's a friend. It's a friend.

1640
01:43:48,130 --> 01:43:50,130
His friend showed up.

1641
01:43:50,130 --> 01:43:53,779
Oh my god, I'm so scared. Oh my god.

1642
01:43:53,779 --> 01:43:55,779
Oh my god, what do I do? What do I?

1643
01:43:55,779 --> 01:44:01,859
Fuck, I was trying to go for a two.

1644
01:44:01,859 --> 01:44:07,229
It didn't work twice. It's okay.

1645
01:44:07,229 --> 01:44:16,560
But, here

1646
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:19,180
we go. So, Mirantula,

1647
01:44:19,180 --> 01:44:23,069
show it off. Ah!

1648
01:44:23,069 --> 01:44:27,600
Place. There's no, wait, what do you mean

1649
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:29,600
there's no room? I can't put it on the table?

1650
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:34,529
Yes!

1651
01:44:34,529 --> 01:44:43,789
Wow! It's just you

1652
01:44:43,789 --> 01:44:52,180
and me. This is so cool.

1653
01:44:52,180 --> 01:45:00,479
Right, here. Okay.

1654
01:45:00,479 --> 01:45:02,659
Come on. What do you want to watch?

1655
01:45:02,659 --> 01:45:11,300
Oh, you can watch it on Switch, whatever you want.

1656
01:45:11,300 --> 01:45:21,340
Put on anything. Small.

1657
01:45:21,340 --> 01:45:23,340
He's gonna binge Rocket Power.

1658
01:45:23,340 --> 01:45:25,779
I come back in

1659
01:45:25,779 --> 01:45:30,239
and watch history is like

1660
01:45:30,239 --> 01:45:32,239
every single fucking season,

1661
01:45:32,239 --> 01:45:34,239
every single episode of like

1662
01:45:34,239 --> 01:45:37,380
Doctor Who has just been watched.

1663
01:45:37,380 --> 01:45:40,000
Of all like

1664
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:49,409
20 years of the series. Okay.

1665
01:45:49,409 --> 01:45:51,409
So now, go just, do I just go to the airport?

1666
01:45:51,409 --> 01:45:57,420
What a mediocre show.

1667
01:45:57,420 --> 01:45:59,420
I'm, I think

1668
01:45:59,420 --> 01:46:01,420
what you just said right there.

1669
01:46:01,420 --> 01:46:03,420
I'm 99% certain that

1670
01:46:03,420 --> 01:46:05,420
somebody's going to scream in your face because you said that.

1671
01:46:05,420 --> 01:46:09,579
You know what I'm saying? Like I would

1672
01:46:09,579 --> 01:46:11,579
someone's probably gonna scream at you.

1673
01:46:11,579 --> 01:46:14,779
Where am I going? Where's the

1674
01:46:14,779 --> 01:46:16,779
airport? Down here.

1675
01:46:16,779 --> 01:46:28,619
So what can I do? I can go to a mystery

1676
01:46:28,619 --> 01:46:34,640
island? Doctor Who bad.

1677
01:46:34,640 --> 01:46:40,079
Doctor Who bad. Hey, welcome

1678
01:46:40,079 --> 01:46:42,079
to your one and only gateway to the skies.

1679
01:46:42,079 --> 01:46:44,079
Soft Crest Airport. Nice to meet you.

1680
01:46:44,079 --> 01:46:46,079
I'm Orville, ground crew for Dodo Airlines.

1681
01:46:46,079 --> 01:46:48,079
Dodo Airlines, the crew may be flightless.

1682
01:46:48,079 --> 01:46:50,380
That doesn't mean you have to be.

1683
01:46:50,380 --> 01:46:52,380
If you want to visit another island, invite friends

1684
01:46:52,380 --> 01:46:54,380
this one. Or go on a mystery tour, this is the place

1685
01:46:54,380 --> 01:46:56,380
to be. Oh, we've also got a mail

1686
01:46:56,380 --> 01:46:58,380
service at this airport. Sometimes a letter

1687
01:46:58,380 --> 01:47:00,380
is just better, you know?

1688
01:47:00,380 --> 01:47:02,380
If you want to send somebody a note, take a gander

1689
01:47:02,380 --> 01:47:04,619
to your right. Got all kinds of cards

1690
01:47:04,619 --> 01:47:07,380
at the card stand. By the way,

1691
01:47:07,380 --> 01:47:10,060
you're Jeremy, right?

1692
01:47:10,060 --> 01:47:12,060
It's a small island. Word gets around.

1693
01:47:12,060 --> 01:47:14,500
I just got a Nook Miles ticket

1694
01:47:14,500 --> 01:47:16,500
from Tom Nook with Jeremy written

1695
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:18,500
on it, which makes it yours.

1696
01:47:18,500 --> 01:47:20,500
So if you want to use this ticket,

1697
01:47:20,500 --> 01:47:22,500
you just got to say the magic words.

1698
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:26,529
I want to fly. Got it? So,

1699
01:47:26,529 --> 01:47:28,529
Jeremy, you got anything

1700
01:47:28,529 --> 01:47:31,659
to tell me? Thank you, Guy on

1701
01:47:31,659 --> 01:47:33,659
Fiverr for your voice acting that I paid

1702
01:47:33,659 --> 01:47:35,659
for. It was like $14.

1703
01:47:35,659 --> 01:47:38,609
Appreciate it. I want visitors.

1704
01:47:38,609 --> 01:47:40,609
I want to fly. Wait,

1705
01:47:40,609 --> 01:47:42,609
I want to send some cards

1706
01:47:42,609 --> 01:47:47,199
in the mail.

1707
01:47:47,199 --> 01:47:49,199
They have a card stand here. Looks like I can send a

1708
01:47:49,199 --> 01:47:52,529
message on a card with 200 bells.

1709
01:47:52,529 --> 01:47:56,989
Send a letter? Sure.

1710
01:47:56,989 --> 01:47:58,989
I want to go to Mystery Island.

1711
01:47:58,989 --> 01:48:00,989
I'm not letting chat join this.

1712
01:48:00,989 --> 01:48:02,989
I will ruin my whole game.

1713
01:48:02,989 --> 01:48:08,289
I want to fly. People are going to come

1714
01:48:08,289 --> 01:48:10,460
out here and just start throwing grass on

1715
01:48:10,460 --> 01:48:12,460
the ground. They're going to do like the Dark Souls

1716
01:48:12,460 --> 01:48:14,460
thing, where they just drop fucking humanity

1717
01:48:14,460 --> 01:48:23,810
everywhere until your game crashes. I want

1718
01:48:23,810 --> 01:48:25,979
to visit someone. I want...what should I do?

1719
01:48:25,979 --> 01:48:27,979
Do I use the Nook Miles ticket?

1720
01:48:27,979 --> 01:48:32,340
You want to use your Nook Miles ticket?

1721
01:48:32,340 --> 01:48:35,090
Roger. In that case, I'll just take this ticket

1722
01:48:35,090 --> 01:48:37,460
I got from Tom Nook.

1723
01:48:37,460 --> 01:48:39,460
Ready to get you in the sky right this minute, but let's just check.

1724
01:48:39,460 --> 01:48:43,489
Are you all packed? Tools already?

1725
01:48:43,489 --> 01:48:45,659
Wait, not yet.

1726
01:48:45,659 --> 01:48:47,659
Do I have any...wait, actually, I'm good.

1727
01:48:50,529 --> 01:48:53,920
Okay, hold on. Okay, I got a lot of crap in my inventory.

1728
01:48:53,920 --> 01:49:00,699
Hold on. I'll visit somebody from chat.

1729
01:49:00,699 --> 01:49:05,119
No, I don't want anyone to...I don't want to

1730
01:49:05,119 --> 01:49:07,119
visit somebody from chat. They can like reverse fucking

1731
01:49:07,119 --> 01:49:09,119
Google Image search my game and find my game.

1732
01:49:09,119 --> 01:49:20,369
I'm not doing...no. True.

1733
01:49:20,369 --> 01:49:22,369
He knows.

1734
01:49:22,369 --> 01:49:24,369
He's paranoid.

1735
01:49:24,369 --> 01:49:29,939
Hey, what are you watching? He's fucking

1736
01:49:29,939 --> 01:49:31,939
scary. I would never be able

1737
01:49:31,939 --> 01:49:33,939
to have a Tarantula for a pet, never, in a

1738
01:49:33,939 --> 01:49:44,300
million years. They're just scary.

1739
01:49:44,300 --> 01:49:47,039
I'll be honest.

1740
01:49:47,039 --> 01:49:49,039
I know they're not, and I know that's me just

1741
01:49:49,039 --> 01:49:51,340
being...that's bullshit.

1742
01:49:51,340 --> 01:49:53,899
I know, but they're scary.

1743
01:49:53,899 --> 01:49:55,899
They're terrifying to me. They

1744
01:49:55,899 --> 01:50:16,260
terrify the fuck out of me. Alright, what do I

1745
01:50:16,260 --> 01:50:19,460
need to bring? I need

1746
01:50:19,460 --> 01:50:22,270
I don't need the watering can. Shovel, net,

1747
01:50:22,270 --> 01:50:24,579
pole vault, slingshot,

1748
01:50:24,579 --> 01:50:28,739
I don't need the umbrella. Axe?

1749
01:50:28,739 --> 01:50:34,180
I need a fishing rod. Yeah. Alright.

1750
01:50:34,180 --> 01:50:42,539
Go visit italics? People say visit

1751
01:50:42,539 --> 01:50:50,609
Vinnie? Where did my rod go?

1752
01:50:50,609 --> 01:50:59,439
But they like playing their games.

1753
01:50:59,439 --> 01:51:04,560
I'm not going to go invade anybody.

1754
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:10,770
I don't want to be like a fucking Dark Souls

1755
01:51:10,770 --> 01:51:19,789
invader. Another Dark Souls

1756
01:51:19,789 --> 01:51:26,380
reference. There it is. Didn't Vinnie say

1757
01:51:26,380 --> 01:51:28,380
multiple times he didn't want to do online?

1758
01:51:28,380 --> 01:51:30,380
Yeah, that's what I'm saying. It's not like

1759
01:51:30,380 --> 01:51:33,500
Okay, listen.

1760
01:51:33,500 --> 01:51:35,680
If a bunch of...

1761
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:37,680
Let's say somebody was in their house

1762
01:51:37,680 --> 01:51:39,680
just sitting down like on their bed

1763
01:51:39,680 --> 01:51:41,859
and hanging out with some people. And then

1764
01:51:41,859 --> 01:51:43,859
there's like a whole group of people in another house

1765
01:51:43,859 --> 01:51:45,859
that want one person to

1766
01:51:45,859 --> 01:51:47,859
go over to that other person's house.

1767
01:51:47,859 --> 01:51:50,859
Dude, go to that person's house. Go

1768
01:51:50,859 --> 01:51:53,229
check out that person's house.

1769
01:51:53,229 --> 01:51:55,229
Alright, I'm going. And I'm like, I go over there and I fucking

1770
01:51:55,229 --> 01:51:57,229
start climbing up the window and knock on the window.

1771
01:51:57,229 --> 01:51:59,229
Hey, man. Hey, can I come in your

1772
01:51:59,229 --> 01:52:01,600
house? It's like, dude, I don't want anybody

1773
01:52:01,600 --> 01:52:03,600
over here right now. I know, but that's me.

1774
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:05,600
That's me, man. I'm coming over, right?

1775
01:52:05,600 --> 01:52:08,930
No, I don't want

1776
01:52:08,930 --> 01:52:10,930
anybody over. Hey, okay, just come in.

1777
01:52:10,930 --> 01:52:12,930
Yeah, that's right. I'm on the window.

1778
01:52:12,930 --> 01:52:14,930
And I fucking slide in. What are we doing?

1779
01:52:14,930 --> 01:52:16,930
What are we doing? Can I drink these beers?

1780
01:52:16,930 --> 01:52:19,939
Thanks, man.

1781
01:52:19,939 --> 01:52:21,939
Oh, that's a good one. You got any food?

1782
01:52:21,939 --> 01:52:24,939
I don't know what to say.

1783
01:52:24,939 --> 01:52:26,939
If we want to do it, then

1784
01:52:26,939 --> 01:52:30,659
we'll do it. We'll set it up.

1785
01:52:30,659 --> 01:52:33,220
Sorry.

1786
01:52:33,220 --> 01:52:35,220
Oh, sorry.

1787
01:52:35,220 --> 01:52:37,220
Well, what? Are you going to get mad at me?

1788
01:52:37,220 --> 01:52:39,220
I see your face right there. You're looking at me with a mad face.

1789
01:52:39,220 --> 01:52:41,220
You've got a buffet-style fucking

1790
01:52:41,220 --> 01:52:44,289
party here. What do you want me to do?

1791
01:52:44,289 --> 01:52:53,380
You don't have a sneeze guard.

1792
01:52:53,380 --> 01:53:00,800
I visited my

1793
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:02,800
drunken gerba at 3 a.m.

1794
01:53:05,939 --> 01:53:12,850
Oh, that's so stupid.

1795
01:53:12,850 --> 01:53:14,850
That's unfucking believable. All right.

1796
01:53:14,850 --> 01:53:17,409
Put the fire out. No!

1797
01:53:17,409 --> 01:53:19,409
No! No!

1798
01:53:19,409 --> 01:53:21,409
YouTube! Whoa!

1799
01:53:21,409 --> 01:53:31,260
Now it's not even scented.

1800
01:53:31,260 --> 01:53:33,890
All right. I'm going to the mystery

1801
01:53:33,890 --> 01:53:37,279
island. I got my tools.

1802
01:53:37,279 --> 01:53:39,279
Wait, no, I don't. I need a fishing

1803
01:53:39,279 --> 01:53:41,710
rod. Build it.

1804
01:53:41,710 --> 01:53:43,710
I did that joke yesterday. I'm not going to do

1805
01:53:43,710 --> 01:53:45,710
it again. I know. I mean, we're going to repeat

1806
01:53:45,710 --> 01:53:47,710
the same thing we just did. I'm

1807
01:53:47,710 --> 01:53:49,710
going to go the I am to set it. And then I'm going to

1808
01:53:49,710 --> 01:53:51,710
do the re thing.

1809
01:53:51,710 --> 01:53:53,710
But he spins. We already did that yesterday.

1810
01:53:53,710 --> 01:54:03,819
It's been less than 24 hours since I did that.

1811
01:54:03,819 --> 01:54:05,819
Remember, we just saw a frame of nudity.

1812
01:54:05,819 --> 01:54:09,340
So what is this?

1813
01:54:09,340 --> 01:54:11,899
Tire toy? Oh, cool.

1814
01:54:11,899 --> 01:54:15,100
All right. What does a fishing rod take?

1815
01:54:15,100 --> 01:54:17,539
Three branches.

1816
01:54:17,539 --> 01:54:31,300
Shake, shake, shake, shake.

1817
01:54:31,300 --> 01:54:34,100
What is that? Shake, shake, shake,

1818
01:54:34,100 --> 01:54:36,460
shake, shake, shake.

1819
01:54:36,460 --> 01:54:38,460
That's from Mystic Makers for the Nintendo 64.

1820
01:54:38,460 --> 01:54:40,460
I'll be playing that at some point.

1821
01:54:40,460 --> 01:54:56,020
Just farm tarantulas.

1822
01:54:56,020 --> 01:54:58,579
Just have a house of tarantulas.

1823
01:54:58,579 --> 01:55:04,779
Can I just have like every

1824
01:55:04,779 --> 01:55:06,779
tile in my house be tarantulas?

1825
01:55:06,779 --> 01:55:14,779
Just ride the rides in the amusement

1826
01:55:14,779 --> 01:55:19,649
park level. Go to the new island

1827
01:55:19,649 --> 01:55:21,649
already. I got to have a fishing rod, man.

1828
01:55:21,649 --> 01:55:24,079
And you're going to throw it in all caps

1829
01:55:24,079 --> 01:55:43,340
to me? A little annoyed by this.

1830
01:55:43,340 --> 01:55:46,539
OK, so we got, we just need

1831
01:55:46,539 --> 01:55:48,539
to get rid of these. Sell the twigs.

1832
01:55:48,539 --> 01:55:50,539
Who cares? Who even cares?

1833
01:55:50,539 --> 01:55:54,060
Sell. Fuck you,

1834
01:55:54,060 --> 01:55:56,060
Jerema. You rock. Kind of a weird

1835
01:55:56,060 --> 01:55:58,239
statement to make back to back

1836
01:55:58,239 --> 01:56:04,640
there. No, I want to sell.

1837
01:56:04,640 --> 01:56:07,140
Not B-A. Oh, fuck it.

1838
01:56:07,140 --> 01:56:09,140
I just dropped on the ground. I'm going to go on the plane

1839
01:56:09,140 --> 01:56:15,220
now. Good job, Jerema.

1840
01:56:15,220 --> 01:56:17,970
Nice one, dude. I'm sitting in my

1841
01:56:17,970 --> 01:56:19,970
chair right now leaning back.

1842
01:56:19,970 --> 01:56:30,449
Nice one, dude.

1843
01:56:30,449 --> 01:56:33,140
B'day. Fuck this guy. Fuck this

1844
01:56:33,140 --> 01:56:35,140
guy. Fuck this guy. Fuck this guy. Fuck this guy.

1845
01:56:35,140 --> 01:56:37,140
God, he sucks.

1846
01:56:54,479 --> 01:57:18,270
Who would have guessed that he would use that clip?

1847
01:57:18,270 --> 01:57:20,270
You may think I might be overdoing it, but do you

1848
01:57:20,270 --> 01:57:22,270
and if you haven't been here for a while, you might not know.

1849
01:57:22,270 --> 01:57:24,270
I've been waiting so long to get

1850
01:57:24,270 --> 01:57:26,270
that real sneeze recorded on

1851
01:57:26,270 --> 01:57:28,270
this stupid fucking thing. It's been

1852
01:57:28,270 --> 01:57:30,510
at least four or five months.

1853
01:57:30,510 --> 01:57:33,140
I'm sorry. I'm going to use

1854
01:57:33,140 --> 01:57:35,140
it. I've been waiting. I got my new toy.

1855
01:57:35,140 --> 01:57:37,140
I'm going to use it. Sorry.

1856
01:57:37,140 --> 01:57:39,140
It's the way it is. It's just the way it is.

1857
01:57:39,140 --> 01:57:42,779
Saltcrest

1858
01:57:42,779 --> 01:57:44,779
airport.

1859
01:57:44,779 --> 01:57:47,920
I want to fly.

1860
01:57:47,920 --> 01:57:54,560
Let's go to

1861
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:57,119
Mystery Island.

1862
01:57:57,119 --> 01:58:00,380
Loop the sneeze for three hours.

1863
01:58:00,380 --> 01:58:02,380
People would leave. They really would.

1864
01:58:02,380 --> 01:58:04,380
I mean, we make jokes, but people would actually be like,

1865
01:58:04,380 --> 01:58:06,380
I'm never coming back again.

1866
01:58:06,380 --> 01:58:11,039
Time for takeoff.

1867
01:58:11,039 --> 01:58:13,039
Did you delete almond or Wi-Fi? Yes, I did.

1868
01:58:13,039 --> 01:58:20,909
Dodo one. This is Dodo tower.

1869
01:58:20,909 --> 01:58:22,909
Wilbert. You copy? Got a walker

1870
01:58:22,909 --> 01:58:25,409
who needs wings. Roger.

1871
01:58:25,409 --> 01:58:27,409
Roger.

1872
01:58:27,409 --> 01:58:29,409
There you go.

1873
01:58:29,409 --> 01:58:31,409
How much time do I have on here?

1874
01:58:31,409 --> 01:58:33,409
Is this a limited amount of time here?

1875
01:58:41,859 --> 01:58:43,859
We're two down and docked at the

1876
01:58:43,859 --> 01:58:45,859
target. First time getting

1877
01:58:45,859 --> 01:58:47,859
your pontoons wet on

1878
01:58:47,859 --> 01:58:49,859
floor. Let me brief you on the Mystery Island.

1879
01:58:49,859 --> 01:58:51,859
First, we run the finder's keepers

1880
01:58:51,859 --> 01:58:53,859
protocol here. Lumber, root,

1881
01:58:53,859 --> 01:58:55,859
fish, whatever. Yours if you can carry it.

1882
01:58:55,859 --> 01:58:57,859
Next up, break a tool. Forget one.

1883
01:58:57,859 --> 01:58:59,859
I can requisition or you will replacement.

1884
01:58:59,859 --> 01:59:01,859
Got to charge you miles though.

1885
01:59:01,859 --> 01:59:03,859
There's one red line item you need

1886
01:59:03,859 --> 01:59:05,859
to memorize like your favorite leotard order.

1887
01:59:05,859 --> 01:59:07,859
Anything you leave behind stays here. We don't

1888
01:59:07,859 --> 01:59:09,859
come back to these places.

1889
01:59:11,859 --> 01:59:13,859
Actually burn the flight plans afterwards. Security

1890
01:59:13,859 --> 01:59:15,859
reasons. Can't explain that.

1891
01:59:15,859 --> 01:59:17,859
Kylo Ren.

1892
01:59:28,020 --> 01:59:31,859
No.

1893
01:59:31,859 --> 01:59:34,800
Go catch some bees.

1894
01:59:34,800 --> 01:59:36,800
Oh, wow. Holy shit. Look at these flowers.

1895
01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:39,739
What? What?

1896
01:59:39,739 --> 01:59:45,420
I can just take them?

1897
01:59:45,420 --> 01:59:47,420
Why can I just take everything?

1898
01:59:47,420 --> 01:59:57,279
Holy shit. It's all free.

1899
01:59:57,279 --> 02:00:14,430
Let me get this right.

1900
02:00:14,430 --> 02:00:45,199
Okay, that's good. Use the shovel on

1901
02:00:45,199 --> 02:00:53,899
the flowers. What's the difference?

1902
02:00:53,899 --> 02:00:58,380
Oh, it's like the actual plant.

1903
02:00:58,380 --> 02:01:04,850
Use the shovel. I know

1904
02:01:04,850 --> 02:01:06,850
I see the cow. I'm trying not to get that

1905
02:01:06,850 --> 02:01:09,340
excited about it. Trying to stay

1906
02:01:09,340 --> 02:01:17,979
grounded.

1907
02:01:17,979 --> 02:01:26,369
I just take them all? No, I don't want this

1908
02:01:26,369 --> 02:01:30,979
theft. Well, is it theft if

1909
02:01:30,979 --> 02:01:32,979
they just told? The guy just told me on the dock.

1910
02:01:32,979 --> 02:01:34,979
Take everything you can carry.

1911
02:01:34,979 --> 02:01:36,979
I see a stink bug.

1912
02:01:36,979 --> 02:01:40,239
I missed it and I'm bucking

1913
02:01:40,239 --> 02:01:43,630
furious. How could I

1914
02:01:43,630 --> 02:01:45,630
be so stupid? How could I

1915
02:01:45,630 --> 02:01:47,630
mess that up?

1916
02:01:47,630 --> 02:01:53,899
I can sell this stuff, can't I?

1917
02:01:53,899 --> 02:02:09,630
Sneeze alert. What do you mean

1918
02:02:09,630 --> 02:02:11,939
sneeze alert? Wait, okay,

1919
02:02:11,939 --> 02:02:13,939
hold on. So you're talking about I just need to do

1920
02:02:13,939 --> 02:02:15,939
this.

1921
02:02:15,939 --> 02:02:17,939
Like that? Is this gonna work?

1922
02:02:17,939 --> 02:02:39,359
Cool. Very cool.

1923
02:02:39,359 --> 02:02:49,789
He gets it. He gets it. He gets it. I do know.

1924
02:02:49,789 --> 02:02:52,220
Are those coconuts?

1925
02:02:52,220 --> 02:02:54,779
Fresh coconuts.

1926
02:02:54,779 --> 02:02:56,779
Can I plant a coconut tree?

1927
02:02:56,779 --> 02:03:00,800
I hope so.

1928
02:03:00,800 --> 02:03:02,800
No, those are dumb. I don't want those.

1929
02:03:02,800 --> 02:03:08,180
Actually, I'm running out

1930
02:03:08,180 --> 02:03:10,479
of space.

1931
02:03:10,479 --> 02:03:12,479
They don't stack.

1932
02:03:12,479 --> 02:03:16,130
These don't stack. Do they?

1933
02:03:16,130 --> 02:03:27,260
No, bury it.

1934
02:03:27,260 --> 02:03:33,659
Oh, shit. Okay.

1935
02:03:33,659 --> 02:03:46,060
Let's talk to Muriel.

1936
02:03:46,060 --> 02:03:48,060
Great to meet you. How are you?

1937
02:03:48,060 --> 02:03:50,060
I'm Patty. Welcome to my

1938
02:03:50,060 --> 02:03:52,060
Hype-tastic island getaway.

1939
02:03:52,060 --> 02:03:54,060
It's not my island, but it will be.

1940
02:03:54,060 --> 02:03:56,060
I want to be a pop star in all pop stars

1941
02:03:56,060 --> 02:03:58,060
on island.

1942
02:03:58,060 --> 02:04:00,060
To your Germans who salt-crest fab, I love meeting new

1943
02:04:00,060 --> 02:04:02,060
folks, aka new fans.

1944
02:04:02,060 --> 02:04:05,890
Nothing better than

1945
02:04:05,890 --> 02:04:07,890
kicking back and chilling on an island would be

1946
02:04:07,890 --> 02:04:09,890
to do it forever.

1947
02:04:09,890 --> 02:04:11,890
Spending time on an island is the best way to find your inner calm

1948
02:04:11,890 --> 02:04:13,890
and hug it as hard as you

1949
02:04:13,890 --> 02:04:15,890
can. If I lived on an island,

1950
02:04:15,890 --> 02:04:17,890
how now? I'd be the

1951
02:04:17,890 --> 02:04:19,890
calmest, most relaxed, cow-pop star I've ever met.

1952
02:04:19,890 --> 02:04:22,449
Do you want to live on

1953
02:04:22,449 --> 02:04:24,819
my

1954
02:04:24,819 --> 02:04:27,819
island?

1955
02:04:27,819 --> 02:04:29,819
Move to Saltcrest? Oh my

1956
02:04:29,819 --> 02:04:31,819
gosh, yes.

1957
02:04:31,819 --> 02:04:33,819
I could move to any old island, but this is way better

1958
02:04:33,819 --> 02:04:36,510
since you'll be there.

1959
02:04:36,510 --> 02:04:38,510
You hear that, world? I'm moving

1960
02:04:38,510 --> 02:04:42,159
to Saltcrest.

1961
02:04:42,159 --> 02:04:44,159
Yay.

1962
02:04:44,159 --> 02:04:46,159
That's sarcastic.

1963
02:04:46,159 --> 02:04:48,159
Oh my gosh, moving. Hey, guys, so stressful. So much to do.

1964
02:04:48,159 --> 02:04:50,159
Gotta calm down. Center yourself,

1965
02:04:50,159 --> 02:04:52,159
hug it. Find your

1966
02:04:52,159 --> 02:04:54,159
happy place. Calm down.

1967
02:04:54,159 --> 02:04:56,159
How better? So all I gotta do is

1968
02:04:56,159 --> 02:04:58,159
get this train going and just talk to Tom Nook.

1969
02:04:58,159 --> 02:05:00,159
Easy. I cannot

1970
02:05:00,159 --> 02:05:02,159
wait to have a cheek

1971
02:05:02,159 --> 02:05:04,159
Saltcrest zip code.

1972
02:05:04,159 --> 02:05:06,659
Welcome.

1973
02:05:06,659 --> 02:05:10,800
See you when you get there.

1974
02:05:10,800 --> 02:05:22,500
Ooh, there's another rock. I see a

1975
02:05:22,500 --> 02:05:25,060
rock. Uh-oh.

1976
02:05:25,060 --> 02:05:27,060
Okay. Drop this? I gotta replant some

1977
02:05:27,060 --> 02:05:29,060
shit. So let me...

1978
02:05:29,060 --> 02:05:31,060
Okay, we're gonna do

1979
02:05:31,060 --> 02:05:50,880
one of each. Plant.

1980
02:05:50,880 --> 02:05:54,270
And then, plant, no.

1981
02:05:54,270 --> 02:06:06,289
Plant.

1982
02:06:06,289 --> 02:06:08,289
I have so many yellow ones.

1983
02:06:08,289 --> 02:06:12,579
Plant this, too.

1984
02:06:12,579 --> 02:06:15,949
I get it.

1985
02:06:15,949 --> 02:06:17,949
Stupid. What do you mean stupid?

1986
02:06:17,949 --> 02:06:21,539
Don't plant next to rock.

1987
02:06:21,539 --> 02:06:24,029
Why? What's going on?

1988
02:06:24,029 --> 02:06:26,029
Just eat the peaches.

1989
02:06:26,029 --> 02:06:28,779
You don't have to dig.

1990
02:06:28,779 --> 02:06:48,539
I don't have to dig.

1991
02:06:48,539 --> 02:06:50,539
Oh, I see what you're saying. I get it now.

1992
02:06:50,539 --> 02:06:52,539
Now I understand.

1993
02:06:52,539 --> 02:06:55,420
Oh, fuck it, it's already ruined, I'm curious.

1994
02:06:55,420 --> 02:06:56,779
Anything's already broken in front of me.

1995
02:06:56,779 --> 02:06:57,619
What am I gonna do?

1996
02:06:57,619 --> 02:07:04,449
I don't know, it's over.

1997
02:07:04,449 --> 02:07:12,220
Well, coconut's giving me 2,000 nook miles wasted.

1998
02:07:12,220 --> 02:07:13,859
No, it's not, it's not.

1999
02:07:13,859 --> 02:07:15,899
It's my first time on Nook Island.

2000
02:07:16,859 --> 02:07:28,880
It's okay, I accidentally brought home too many plants.

2001
02:07:28,880 --> 02:07:31,630
And I, I wasn't even looking.

2002
02:07:31,630 --> 02:07:48,880
Can I dig up the tree?

2003
02:07:48,880 --> 02:07:56,350
Do I take a coconut tree with me?

2004
02:07:56,350 --> 02:07:57,710
Zero out of 10.

2005
02:07:57,710 --> 02:08:00,810
Okay, now I can, can I, do I take this with me?

2006
02:08:03,460 --> 02:08:07,350
Oh my God.

2007
02:08:07,350 --> 02:08:10,579
Let's get a, let's take all of them.

2008
02:08:10,579 --> 02:08:19,579
Eat another one.

2009
02:08:19,579 --> 02:08:21,060
Fruits are steroids.

2010
02:08:21,060 --> 02:08:22,819
Wait, why is it one out of 10?

2011
02:08:22,819 --> 02:08:24,020
What happens if I eat 10?

2012
02:08:33,600 --> 02:08:38,270
10, you'll die.

2013
02:08:38,270 --> 02:08:39,109
That's bad.

2014
02:08:40,350 --> 02:08:46,409
I'll take, I'll take like three of them.

2015
02:08:46,409 --> 02:08:47,250
It's a charge.

2016
02:08:47,250 --> 02:08:48,409
Oh, okay.

2017
02:08:52,960 --> 02:09:01,939
These have to be planted on the beach?

2018
02:09:01,939 --> 02:09:04,020
Yeah, well, oh wait, what about my problem

2019
02:09:04,020 --> 02:09:11,310
with having beach real estate?

2020
02:09:11,310 --> 02:09:13,510
Fuck are you all, you, they're following me around.

2021
02:09:13,510 --> 02:09:14,350
I swear to God.

2022
02:09:15,579 --> 02:09:18,180
They're following me everywhere.

2023
02:09:18,180 --> 02:09:29,970
They just, they're everywhere.

2024
02:09:29,970 --> 02:09:34,720
Got you.

2025
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:37,220
Yeah, swap it.

2026
02:09:37,220 --> 02:09:43,720
Swap it with these two stones, who cares?

2027
02:09:43,720 --> 02:09:49,859
Okay, anything else that I can do?

2028
02:09:49,859 --> 02:09:56,819
I got a lot of stuff.

2029
02:09:56,819 --> 02:10:04,289
Peaches are not stacked.

2030
02:10:04,289 --> 02:10:07,260
Eat the tarantula.

2031
02:10:07,260 --> 02:10:15,210
I'm not gonna eat the tarantula.

2032
02:10:15,210 --> 02:10:22,039
Shake the pine tree.

2033
02:10:22,039 --> 02:10:22,880
Oh, nothing.

2034
02:10:41,060 --> 02:10:42,140
Come on.

2035
02:10:42,140 --> 02:10:52,920
Come on, fish.

2036
02:10:52,920 --> 02:10:54,800
How do you keep getting tarantulas?

2037
02:10:57,659 --> 02:11:04,390
I don't know, just check my seed.

2038
02:11:04,390 --> 02:11:06,609
Oh, worthless.

2039
02:11:08,779 --> 02:11:09,619
Throw it back in.

2040
02:11:29,430 --> 02:11:30,510
I caught a boot.

2041
02:11:31,960 --> 02:11:34,920
Swap it, can I turn this into something?

2042
02:11:34,920 --> 02:11:38,300
Swap it with like a tree branches.

2043
02:11:40,750 --> 02:11:42,590
I could wear these if I found another one

2044
02:11:42,590 --> 02:11:53,220
and got a recipe.

2045
02:11:53,220 --> 02:11:54,819
You get two boots, you can make a pair of shoes.

2046
02:11:54,819 --> 02:12:03,020
It's funny.

2047
02:12:03,020 --> 02:12:09,020
Come on.

2048
02:12:09,020 --> 02:12:10,020
What is it, a tadpole?

2049
02:12:10,979 --> 02:12:11,819
Tadpole.

2050
02:12:15,479 --> 02:12:19,140
There's another fish over here.

2051
02:12:19,140 --> 02:12:19,979
A couple.

2052
02:12:19,979 --> 02:12:21,420
Oh, look it, there's a lot of fish in here.

2053
02:12:36,779 --> 02:12:38,500
I caught a carp.

2054
02:12:38,500 --> 02:12:40,779
I had another one, I could do a carpool.

2055
02:12:40,779 --> 02:12:41,859
Sure, swap it with.

2056
02:12:48,930 --> 02:12:54,020
I'm out of room.

2057
02:12:54,020 --> 02:13:03,079
Oh, I'm gonna get all the peaches and it's time to go.

2058
02:13:03,079 --> 02:13:05,520
I can grab the flowers.

2059
02:13:05,520 --> 02:13:10,510
Just actually pick them up, yeah.

2060
02:13:10,510 --> 02:13:12,029
Plant those goddamn flowers.

2061
02:13:12,029 --> 02:13:15,289
When I get back, I will.

2062
02:13:15,289 --> 02:13:17,489
Drop them, why?

2063
02:13:17,489 --> 02:13:20,010
Why would I do when you don't need peaches?

2064
02:13:23,300 --> 02:13:28,279
Can't I just, what's the point though?

2065
02:13:28,279 --> 02:13:29,199
Plant them in here.

2066
02:13:31,180 --> 02:13:33,020
Wait, aren't I just like leaving?

2067
02:13:33,020 --> 02:13:33,859
This is the mystery island.

2068
02:13:33,859 --> 02:13:40,260
You only just like leave after this and who gives a shit?

2069
02:13:40,260 --> 02:13:47,180
Wait, I come back here is what you're saying.

2070
02:13:47,180 --> 02:13:57,689
Oh, no you don't.

2071
02:13:57,689 --> 02:13:59,289
Oh, you never do, okay.

2072
02:13:59,289 --> 02:14:04,250
I want these flowers, I wanna keep them.

2073
02:14:04,250 --> 02:14:08,659
Plants are useless, aren't they?

2074
02:14:08,659 --> 02:14:12,979
The islands are just random.

2075
02:14:12,979 --> 02:14:14,180
You don't need so many.

2076
02:14:18,659 --> 02:14:28,130
All right, I need to make another hole.

2077
02:14:28,130 --> 02:14:33,869
I've already expelled that one for the cow.

2078
02:14:33,869 --> 02:14:37,180
I already got the cow, the cow's coming with me.

2079
02:14:37,180 --> 02:14:39,100
Keep plants, drop flowers.

2080
02:14:55,180 --> 02:15:13,500
Okay, so what should I pick up instead?

2081
02:15:13,500 --> 02:15:19,020
There's a centipede in here.

2082
02:15:19,020 --> 02:15:19,859
I hate it.

2083
02:15:22,680 --> 02:15:25,399
Another couple of fish?

2084
02:15:25,399 --> 02:15:26,840
I'll try to get another fish.

2085
02:15:26,840 --> 02:15:37,689
Every island has a piece of furniture in the trees.

2086
02:15:37,689 --> 02:15:40,649
Really?

2087
02:15:40,649 --> 02:15:46,340
Are you kidding?

2088
02:15:46,340 --> 02:15:49,689
Did I just get it?

2089
02:15:49,689 --> 02:15:51,529
What the hell was that?

2090
02:15:51,529 --> 02:15:54,479
Rattan wardrobe?

2091
02:15:54,479 --> 02:15:58,220
Well, okay.

2092
02:15:58,220 --> 02:16:00,960
Time to go.

2093
02:16:00,960 --> 02:16:01,960
But that's it.

2094
02:16:01,960 --> 02:16:04,020
I got everything I want.

2095
02:16:04,020 --> 02:16:12,689
Time to move.

2096
02:16:12,689 --> 02:16:14,939
Fun.

2097
02:16:14,939 --> 02:16:17,140
All right, let's go home.

2098
02:16:17,140 --> 02:16:18,300
What about the fish?

2099
02:16:18,300 --> 02:16:19,140
Huge fish.

2100
02:16:21,090 --> 02:16:24,470
All right, I'm gonna try to get the huge fish.

2101
02:16:24,470 --> 02:16:25,630
Huge fucking fish.

2102
02:16:25,630 --> 02:16:45,260
I'm going for it.

2103
02:16:45,260 --> 02:16:52,260
Come here.

2104
02:16:52,260 --> 02:17:02,870
Get it.

2105
02:17:02,870 --> 02:17:14,440
Whoa, I caught a koi.

2106
02:17:14,440 --> 02:17:16,500
Swap it with the mackerel.

2107
02:17:16,500 --> 02:17:22,200
I don't want the mackerel.

2108
02:17:22,200 --> 02:17:24,219
I got a koi.

2109
02:17:24,219 --> 02:17:32,370
There's another big one right here.

2110
02:17:32,409 --> 02:17:33,450
Koi is very rare.

2111
02:17:33,450 --> 02:17:36,340
Is it really?

2112
02:17:36,340 --> 02:17:37,180
Nice.

2113
02:17:37,180 --> 02:17:38,020
Is it really?

2114
02:17:38,020 --> 02:17:46,020
That's so cool.

2115
02:17:46,020 --> 02:17:47,500
It actually is.

2116
02:17:47,500 --> 02:17:48,340
Kind of.

2117
02:17:48,340 --> 02:17:54,729
Cool.

2118
02:17:54,729 --> 02:17:55,569
No!

2119
02:17:55,569 --> 02:18:10,600
It's okay.

2120
02:18:10,600 --> 02:18:13,500
Koi number two.

2121
02:18:13,500 --> 02:18:25,899
Okay.

2122
02:18:25,899 --> 02:18:29,360
Oh, should I get rid of the clay?

2123
02:18:29,360 --> 02:18:36,209
Should I throw my hat in the river?

2124
02:18:36,209 --> 02:18:37,610
Throw away the boot?

2125
02:18:37,610 --> 02:18:43,940
Okay, I'll throw the boot away.

2126
02:18:43,940 --> 02:18:44,780
Well, that was fun.

2127
02:18:44,780 --> 02:18:48,370
Time to go back.

2128
02:18:48,370 --> 02:18:49,329
No!

2129
02:18:49,329 --> 02:18:50,170
Get the boot.

2130
02:18:50,170 --> 02:18:51,090
Wait, get rid of the shovel.

2131
02:18:51,090 --> 02:18:54,059
Oh, I have a flimsy shovel, don't I?

2132
02:18:54,059 --> 02:18:58,020
Yeah, I can just drop this.

2133
02:18:58,020 --> 02:19:03,719
I'll pick the boot up.

2134
02:19:03,719 --> 02:19:04,920
I'm ready to leave.

2135
02:19:04,920 --> 02:19:05,760
That was fun.

2136
02:19:09,040 --> 02:19:10,120
I'm ready to go home.

2137
02:19:16,459 --> 02:19:17,540
I'm ready.

2138
02:19:30,190 --> 02:19:32,690
It is at this time in the stream

2139
02:19:32,690 --> 02:19:34,770
that I'm going to go appraise some of the stuff

2140
02:19:34,770 --> 02:19:35,610
and move stuff around,

2141
02:19:35,610 --> 02:19:37,649
but we're going to start doing the bits

2142
02:19:37,649 --> 02:19:45,600
as we're getting to the end of the stream.

2143
02:19:45,600 --> 02:19:49,489
We're going to hang out still.

2144
02:19:49,489 --> 02:19:52,250
It's time to say our goodbyes.

2145
02:19:52,329 --> 02:19:57,020
Probably four and a half days or so.

2146
02:19:57,020 --> 02:19:58,020
I'll see you guys very soon.

2147
02:19:58,020 --> 02:19:58,860
Hey, what's up?

2148
02:19:58,860 --> 02:20:01,010
Do you want to talk?

2149
02:20:01,010 --> 02:20:02,489
Are you getting stuff together to build us a shop?

2150
02:20:02,489 --> 02:20:03,690
Good, hustle.

2151
02:20:03,690 --> 02:20:04,770
I found something to help my things.

2152
02:20:04,770 --> 02:20:06,170
Here you go.

2153
02:20:06,170 --> 02:20:08,489
I can't carry this right now.

2154
02:20:08,489 --> 02:20:09,969
I was going to make that iron nugget

2155
02:20:09,969 --> 02:20:11,370
into an extra heavy free weight,

2156
02:20:11,370 --> 02:20:12,770
but having a shop's fine.

2157
02:20:15,770 --> 02:20:24,719
Okay.

2158
02:20:24,719 --> 02:20:26,280
So I'm going to put something on the screen

2159
02:20:26,280 --> 02:20:28,520
just so people realize that this is like kind of the end.

2160
02:20:28,520 --> 02:20:33,079
That people just know what's going on.

2161
02:20:33,079 --> 02:20:45,379
Text on the screen.

2162
02:20:45,379 --> 02:20:46,219
There.

2163
02:20:46,219 --> 02:20:52,520
So it says end of the stream, wind down.

2164
02:20:52,520 --> 02:21:01,909
So you know.

2165
02:21:01,909 --> 02:21:03,750
Library stream, please be quiet.

2166
02:21:03,750 --> 02:21:05,510
All right, so I got a bunch of stuff

2167
02:21:05,510 --> 02:21:08,719
and we're going to start going over the bits now.

2168
02:21:08,719 --> 02:21:11,379
Hey, that guy tag.

2169
02:21:11,379 --> 02:21:12,219
This is a long time ago.

2170
02:21:12,219 --> 02:21:15,250
This is like six and a half hours ago.

2171
02:21:15,250 --> 02:21:17,850
Thanks to the 1500 bits tag.

2172
02:21:17,850 --> 02:21:20,850
Newer USB 3.0 capture cards have no delay

2173
02:21:20,850 --> 02:21:24,379
so you don't have to do audio syncs with them.

2174
02:21:24,379 --> 02:21:26,180
Yeah, I'm just a fucking loser.

2175
02:21:26,180 --> 02:21:28,459
And I just, I'm using the same equipment

2176
02:21:28,459 --> 02:21:30,420
from like 2014.

2177
02:21:32,420 --> 02:21:33,940
That's pretty much all there is to it.

2178
02:21:33,940 --> 02:21:35,139
That's really what it is.

2179
02:21:36,870 --> 02:21:37,989
That's pretty much what it is.

2180
02:21:37,989 --> 02:21:39,190
I'm using the same equipment

2181
02:21:39,190 --> 02:21:42,559
from like six and a half years ago.

2182
02:21:42,559 --> 02:21:45,899
It is a true statement, but thanks tag.

2183
02:21:45,899 --> 02:21:49,420
Hey, new place after the move.

2184
02:21:50,739 --> 02:21:54,020
I'm going to be professional streamer, okay?

2185
02:21:54,020 --> 02:21:59,760
New place resolution, new year's resolution.

2186
02:21:59,760 --> 02:22:01,440
Thanks a lot tag, appreciate it.

2187
02:22:01,440 --> 02:22:04,639
Ooh, I can make sloshers, whatever they're called.

2188
02:22:07,030 --> 02:22:10,000
That's cool, but thanks a lot.

2189
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,659
That's $15 from tag.

2190
02:22:12,659 --> 02:22:14,579
S10W update.

2191
02:22:14,579 --> 02:22:15,620
I know your name is slow update,

2192
02:22:15,620 --> 02:22:17,239
but I like saying it that way.

2193
02:22:17,239 --> 02:22:18,079
Thanks to the 250.

2194
02:22:18,079 --> 02:22:19,319
Hey, Jerm, I happen to be donating again.

2195
02:22:19,319 --> 02:22:22,000
Glad to see you in at least functioning condition.

2196
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:22,920
Hope you're living your best life

2197
02:22:22,920 --> 02:22:25,860
and can't wait for the Jermania whenever that will happen.

2198
02:22:25,860 --> 02:22:26,860
Peace and love.

2199
02:22:28,520 --> 02:22:30,700
Hopefully at some point in the fall

2200
02:22:30,700 --> 02:22:33,200
is what it's going to be.

2201
02:22:33,200 --> 02:22:35,670
In the fall, that'll happen.

2202
02:22:35,670 --> 02:22:36,510
Wait, are you moving again?

2203
02:22:36,510 --> 02:22:38,139
Yes.

2204
02:22:38,139 --> 02:22:39,260
Staying in Las Vegas.

2205
02:22:40,180 --> 02:22:41,500
You can get a exclamation point

2206
02:22:41,500 --> 02:22:44,719
while you're moving, whatever the fuck the thing is.

2207
02:22:44,719 --> 02:22:50,690
I'm going to keep one of these toys.

2208
02:22:50,690 --> 02:22:52,489
But the game and the theater screen,

2209
02:22:54,159 --> 02:22:55,040
I don't really want to do that

2210
02:22:55,040 --> 02:22:57,280
because I'm kind of still playing it.

2211
02:22:57,280 --> 02:23:00,889
All right, can I make it like a fish pond?

2212
02:23:00,889 --> 02:23:03,379
Place item.

2213
02:23:09,459 --> 02:23:14,239
Oh, that's not enough room.

2214
02:23:14,239 --> 02:23:17,780
This needs to be like five times bigger.

2215
02:23:17,780 --> 02:23:19,100
Push table up against the wall.

2216
02:23:19,100 --> 02:23:20,500
I can't.

2217
02:23:20,500 --> 02:23:22,399
It's so small.

2218
02:23:22,399 --> 02:23:29,079
Well, I'm donating one to the museum.

2219
02:23:29,079 --> 02:23:32,120
But yeah, hopefully the Derma Rumble stuff.

2220
02:23:32,120 --> 02:23:33,920
That'll happen in the Boston Marathon.

2221
02:23:33,920 --> 02:23:38,750
If you don't know, it got pushed to hopefully in September.

2222
02:23:38,750 --> 02:23:41,750
So that's the whole point of having the stream there.

2223
02:23:41,750 --> 02:23:44,709
We've been sponsoring one of my friend's runs

2224
02:23:44,709 --> 02:23:45,549
in the Boston Marathon.

2225
02:23:45,549 --> 02:23:50,219
So let me go donate some of these things.

2226
02:23:50,219 --> 02:23:51,059
Thanks to the 250.

2227
02:23:51,059 --> 02:23:53,260
Thank you, GooBerry Juice of the 250.

2228
02:23:53,260 --> 02:23:55,059
Mini games for the mini streamer.

2229
02:23:55,059 --> 02:23:56,500
That's a laugh out loud moment.

2230
02:23:56,500 --> 02:24:01,250
Can't watch the stream tonight as I got work to do.

2231
02:24:01,250 --> 02:24:03,409
I hope you had fun nonetheless.

2232
02:24:03,409 --> 02:24:05,729
I hope your move goes well and you like your new place.

2233
02:24:05,729 --> 02:24:07,389
Me too.

2234
02:24:07,389 --> 02:24:09,389
Also make sure to give the Talics a can of beans

2235
02:24:09,389 --> 02:24:14,209
before you drive them out of the forest.

2236
02:24:14,209 --> 02:24:15,049
Thanks for the 250.

2237
02:24:15,049 --> 02:24:21,299
Oh, I can't donate anymore.

2238
02:24:25,510 --> 02:24:28,049
Wait, can I not donate anymore?

2239
02:24:28,049 --> 02:24:29,250
Until the museum's open?

2240
02:24:30,600 --> 02:24:31,440
Shit, okay.

2241
02:24:31,440 --> 02:24:36,180
Well, I guess that'll wait.

2242
02:24:36,180 --> 02:24:37,659
GooBerry Juice, thanks again for 250.

2243
02:24:37,659 --> 02:24:40,940
Also, I found your nudes, idiot.

2244
02:24:40,940 --> 02:24:42,100
Yeah, that was an accident.

2245
02:24:42,100 --> 02:24:42,940
That was an accident.

2246
02:24:42,940 --> 02:24:45,860
One accidental frame of my like bare shoulders.

2247
02:24:45,860 --> 02:24:48,540
Oh well.

2248
02:24:48,540 --> 02:24:49,700
You all know the photo.

2249
02:24:49,700 --> 02:24:52,239
It's okay.

2250
02:24:52,239 --> 02:24:53,799
Should I sell this other?

2251
02:24:53,799 --> 02:24:54,719
What else do I have?

2252
02:24:54,719 --> 02:24:56,719
Wait, I wanna plant these.

2253
02:24:56,719 --> 02:24:58,440
All right, I'm gonna plant.

2254
02:24:58,440 --> 02:25:00,940
Donald Duck, get out of the way.

2255
02:25:00,940 --> 02:25:09,620
I wanna plant those coconut trees.

2256
02:25:09,620 --> 02:25:11,100
I can't plant with other players in nearby.

2257
02:25:11,100 --> 02:25:16,850
Well, how do I chew them off here?

2258
02:25:16,850 --> 02:25:18,129
But thank you, GooBerry Juice.

2259
02:25:18,129 --> 02:25:19,700
Appreciate it.

2260
02:25:19,700 --> 02:25:22,299
I appreciate my nudes, I guess.

2261
02:25:22,299 --> 02:25:24,700
What?

2262
02:25:24,700 --> 02:25:27,709
Get out of the way.

2263
02:25:27,709 --> 02:25:32,500
Lizard Amiibo, thanks to the 250.

2264
02:25:32,500 --> 02:25:33,340
Lizard Amiibo says,

2265
02:25:33,379 --> 02:25:35,219
I'm sure it's my birthday on Wednesday.

2266
02:25:35,219 --> 02:25:36,940
Happy birthday on Wednesday.

2267
02:25:38,879 --> 02:25:42,940
Oh, there's plants on there.

2268
02:25:42,940 --> 02:25:45,459
Happy Wednesday birthday.

2269
02:25:45,459 --> 02:25:46,780
Not excited to spend it at home,

2270
02:25:46,780 --> 02:25:49,180
but I guess I'll just have to make the most of it.

2271
02:25:49,180 --> 02:25:50,379
Anyway, it's been a great stream already.

2272
02:25:50,379 --> 02:25:52,500
It's hard to go wrong with WarioWare.

2273
02:25:52,500 --> 02:25:54,100
The luck with whatever that stuff

2274
02:25:54,100 --> 02:25:57,989
you got going on this week and stay healthy.

2275
02:25:57,989 --> 02:25:59,739
I'm gonna try.

2276
02:25:59,739 --> 02:26:01,579
I tapped Donald.

2277
02:26:01,579 --> 02:26:03,219
Accidentally, I just touched him.

2278
02:26:03,219 --> 02:26:05,739
I just like poked him with the...

2279
02:26:05,739 --> 02:26:08,420
He got like the stick just like...

2280
02:26:08,420 --> 02:26:11,979
I'm trying not to poke him in the eye.

2281
02:26:11,979 --> 02:26:15,040
But happy birthday, Lizard Amiibo.

2282
02:26:15,040 --> 02:26:16,799
Wait, I'm gonna plant these up here.

2283
02:26:16,799 --> 02:26:19,239
Happy birthday on Wednesday.

2284
02:26:19,239 --> 02:26:28,579
I'm gonna go.

2285
02:26:28,579 --> 02:26:29,420
What?

2286
02:26:30,219 --> 02:26:31,659
Oh, I was trying to catch...

2287
02:26:31,659 --> 02:26:33,500
What the fuck?

2288
02:26:33,500 --> 02:26:35,059
He was hiding behind the tree.

2289
02:26:36,020 --> 02:26:37,360
Oh, whatever.

2290
02:26:37,360 --> 02:26:58,350
And here's my garden.

2291
02:26:58,350 --> 02:27:03,989
You got outsmited by a spider.

2292
02:27:03,989 --> 02:27:05,430
Nice.

2293
02:27:05,430 --> 02:27:07,629
Yeah, that's cool.

2294
02:27:07,629 --> 02:27:09,469
I'll have a big garden over there eventually.

2295
02:27:09,510 --> 02:27:10,950
Squiggity-squanky, thanks for the 250.

2296
02:27:10,950 --> 02:27:13,420
They say here it is.

2297
02:27:13,420 --> 02:27:14,299
I'm not sure what here it is.

2298
02:27:14,299 --> 02:27:20,680
It's a clip of something that says regret.

2299
02:27:20,680 --> 02:27:21,520
Oh, let me listen to this.

2300
02:27:21,520 --> 02:27:22,520
It's an ugly garden.

2301
02:27:22,520 --> 02:27:28,659
Well, it's gonna be ugly for a little while.

2302
02:27:28,659 --> 02:27:30,059
This is...

2303
02:27:30,059 --> 02:27:32,229
You guys hear it?

2304
02:27:32,229 --> 02:27:33,709
Turn this down for a second.

2305
02:27:33,709 --> 02:27:35,030
All right, I don't know what this is supposed to be,

2306
02:27:35,030 --> 02:27:36,469
but we'll find out together.

2307
02:27:40,200 --> 02:27:45,889
I got it.

2308
02:27:45,889 --> 02:27:47,649
I don't remember what this context is.

2309
02:27:55,299 --> 02:28:00,500
Anyways, thank you, squiggity-squanky.

2310
02:28:00,500 --> 02:28:04,739
Also, thank you to Archives for 500 bits.

2311
02:28:04,739 --> 02:28:06,690
Thank you, Archives.

2312
02:28:06,690 --> 02:28:08,879
Archives says,

2313
02:28:08,879 --> 02:28:10,479
Hey, Jerma, you may not be able to answer this question,

2314
02:28:10,479 --> 02:28:11,719
but I'm going to ask you

2315
02:28:11,719 --> 02:28:12,959
since you're one of my biggest inspirations.

2316
02:28:12,959 --> 02:28:14,479
When I stream, I get into this weird mode

2317
02:28:14,479 --> 02:28:16,360
where I feel like I'm not myself

2318
02:28:16,360 --> 02:28:17,719
because I'm in front of a live audience.

2319
02:28:17,719 --> 02:28:19,620
Do you have any experience with this?

2320
02:28:19,620 --> 02:28:21,420
I love streaming, but I can't seem to find the niche

2321
02:28:21,420 --> 02:28:23,500
where I'm comfortable and enjoy every stream.

2322
02:28:23,500 --> 02:28:25,659
Well, actually, I'm way more comfortable

2323
02:28:25,659 --> 02:28:29,090
in front of 10,000 people than I am in front of five.

2324
02:28:29,090 --> 02:28:31,860
So, I'm kind of the opposite way.

2325
02:28:32,860 --> 02:28:35,399
I could go in front of a stadium

2326
02:28:35,399 --> 02:28:37,879
and do anything and say anything,

2327
02:28:37,879 --> 02:28:39,719
but you put me in a room with less than 10 people

2328
02:28:39,719 --> 02:28:44,159
and I will have no fucking idea what to do.

2329
02:28:44,159 --> 02:28:45,360
It was 4,700 people.

2330
02:28:45,360 --> 02:28:47,280
Yeah, I'm rounding up.

2331
02:28:47,280 --> 02:28:50,079
I'm rounding up from, it was like 70,

2332
02:28:50,079 --> 02:28:53,059
it was 7,500 people here earlier.

2333
02:28:53,059 --> 02:28:54,299
I'm rounding up a little.

2334
02:28:54,299 --> 02:28:55,979
What, I can't round up on my resume?

2335
02:28:55,979 --> 02:29:02,049
Why not?

2336
02:29:02,049 --> 02:29:03,649
I mean, really all you can do with streaming

2337
02:29:03,649 --> 02:29:06,219
and trying to find what you want to do is just,

2338
02:29:06,219 --> 02:29:08,940
you just got to start throwing spaghetti at your fridge

2339
02:29:08,979 --> 02:29:10,780
and see what works, see what you like to do,

2340
02:29:10,780 --> 02:29:16,069
see how you feel and just try to do the best you can,

2341
02:29:16,069 --> 02:29:21,739
try to have the most fun you can and see what happens.

2342
02:29:21,739 --> 02:29:23,180
And trying to get more comfortable is,

2343
02:29:23,180 --> 02:29:30,940
I mean, that's a process back in like 2010.

2344
02:29:30,940 --> 02:29:32,299
I mean, I can't say that.

2345
02:29:32,299 --> 02:29:35,420
I mean, I guess I was kind of on base cam and stuff,

2346
02:29:35,420 --> 02:29:39,209
but I don't know.

2347
02:29:39,209 --> 02:29:42,879
I feel like I've always kind of just been,

2348
02:29:42,879 --> 02:29:44,579
I've always kind of just been

2349
02:29:44,579 --> 02:29:47,530
the annoying center of attention weirdo.

2350
02:29:47,530 --> 02:29:51,540
So, I've always been a look at me.

2351
02:29:51,540 --> 02:29:54,750
You know what I'm saying?

2352
02:29:55,469 --> 02:29:57,469
I've always been that like fucking annoying guy

2353
02:29:57,469 --> 02:30:00,190
that's like, hey, I have something to say today.

2354
02:30:00,190 --> 02:30:01,950
And everyone's like, okay, Jeremy's going to talk now.

2355
02:30:01,950 --> 02:30:03,590
But I guess we're all going to fucking just have to listen

2356
02:30:03,590 --> 02:30:05,350
for the next five straight minutes.

2357
02:30:05,350 --> 02:30:06,909
I'm going to pick up my phone

2358
02:30:06,909 --> 02:30:09,250
and just pretend to be listening.

2359
02:30:09,250 --> 02:30:12,479
So, I've kind of been uncomfortable doing it

2360
02:30:12,479 --> 02:30:17,780
for a long time.

2361
02:30:17,780 --> 02:30:20,020
But the best way to get better is to just to keep trying

2362
02:30:20,020 --> 02:30:22,100
and see what makes you comfortable.

2363
02:30:22,100 --> 02:30:22,940
Do the things you like to do,

2364
02:30:22,940 --> 02:30:24,100
play the games you like to play

2365
02:30:24,100 --> 02:30:26,139
and stream the way you want to stream.

2366
02:30:26,139 --> 02:30:28,379
It's your stream, remember, it's you.

2367
02:30:28,379 --> 02:30:32,899
It's you doing this.

2368
02:30:32,899 --> 02:30:34,219
He's wasting electricity.

2369
02:30:34,219 --> 02:30:38,010
No, I'm fucking tanning right now.

2370
02:30:38,010 --> 02:30:39,090
Come on.

2371
02:30:39,090 --> 02:30:40,569
Wait, where's my tanning light?

2372
02:30:40,569 --> 02:30:45,100
Here we go.

2373
02:30:45,100 --> 02:30:45,979
I wish you the best of luck though

2374
02:30:45,979 --> 02:30:50,760
with streaming and everything.

2375
02:30:50,760 --> 02:30:52,000
Heldrich, thanks for $5.

2376
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:53,799
I saw you coming out of the Starbucks bathroom

2377
02:30:53,799 --> 02:30:54,920
chewing something,

2378
02:30:54,920 --> 02:30:57,950
but I was too anxious to ask you what it was.

2379
02:30:57,950 --> 02:30:59,270
I cannot fucking believe that.

2380
02:30:59,270 --> 02:31:00,389
I just read that without realizing

2381
02:31:00,389 --> 02:31:01,430
what they were talking about.

2382
02:31:01,430 --> 02:31:02,940
Thanks for $5.

2383
02:31:02,940 --> 02:31:05,459
A John with no H.

2384
02:31:05,459 --> 02:31:07,260
Thanks for the 500 vids.

2385
02:31:07,260 --> 02:31:11,299
Jerma after yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yep, yep, yep, yep.

2386
02:31:11,299 --> 02:31:12,739
That's fucking funny.

2387
02:31:12,739 --> 02:31:14,139
Very hilarious.

2388
02:31:14,139 --> 02:31:16,989
All these kinds of words that you wrote down here.

2389
02:31:16,989 --> 02:31:18,190
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

2390
02:31:18,190 --> 02:31:20,930
You also say, I just finished that BLT.

2391
02:31:20,930 --> 02:31:22,450
Uh-huh, I hope you enjoyed

2392
02:31:22,450 --> 02:31:24,860
that bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich,

2393
02:31:24,860 --> 02:31:27,670
a staple of America.

2394
02:31:27,670 --> 02:31:32,819
Yes, thank you for the $10, John.

2395
02:31:32,819 --> 02:31:34,739
I'm not even sure if you're still,

2396
02:31:34,739 --> 02:31:36,879
you might even be potentially banned.

2397
02:31:36,879 --> 02:31:46,649
I might even be speaking into the wall right now.

2398
02:31:46,649 --> 02:31:48,129
When is the next time you're gonna stream?

2399
02:31:48,129 --> 02:31:51,350
I will answer this for you.

2400
02:31:51,350 --> 02:31:52,629
I'll answer this for you

2401
02:31:52,670 --> 02:31:56,100
because the rest of your two bit comments

2402
02:31:56,100 --> 02:31:57,659
have been unreadable,

2403
02:31:57,659 --> 02:32:01,020
just absolutely un-fucking-readable.

2404
02:32:01,020 --> 02:32:03,860
When do I stream in the CBT time zone?

2405
02:32:03,860 --> 02:32:07,780
Well, I stream Pacific time,

2406
02:32:07,780 --> 02:32:09,260
which is the west coast of the United States.

2407
02:32:09,260 --> 02:32:11,479
I'm in Las Vegas, Nevada.

2408
02:32:11,479 --> 02:32:14,620
Thank you for your question and goodbye forever

2409
02:32:14,620 --> 02:32:16,180
because I probably won't see you again.

2410
02:32:16,180 --> 02:32:18,219
You may have been permanently banned.

2411
02:32:18,219 --> 02:32:22,940
Thank you, okay.

2412
02:32:22,940 --> 02:32:28,629
Anyways, ash686868, thanks for the thousand vids.

2413
02:32:28,670 --> 02:32:31,159
What a tyrant.

2414
02:32:31,159 --> 02:32:32,680
Here, I really have enjoyed your content

2415
02:32:32,680 --> 02:32:33,520
for a couple of years now

2416
02:32:33,520 --> 02:32:35,040
and I also love JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.

2417
02:32:35,040 --> 02:32:38,729
Can you say Killer Queen really loudly?

2418
02:32:38,729 --> 02:32:43,809
It's killer queen, laser beam.

2419
02:32:43,809 --> 02:32:47,700
What does that have to do with JoJo?

2420
02:32:47,700 --> 02:32:53,260
I don't get it.

2421
02:32:53,260 --> 02:32:55,620
There you go, thank you.

2422
02:32:55,620 --> 02:32:58,389
Thanks for the thousand vids.

2423
02:32:58,389 --> 02:33:00,430
The man with the baby hands, thanks for the thousand vids.

2424
02:33:00,430 --> 02:33:07,000
Die to Wario wear wheel, omega low.

2425
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,100
That's just so loud.

2426
02:33:09,100 --> 02:33:11,040
I think I got a good 10.

2427
02:33:11,040 --> 02:33:15,940
Die to Wario wear wheel, sort of.

2428
02:33:15,940 --> 02:33:16,780
Not really though.

2429
02:33:16,780 --> 02:33:19,049
I'm gonna go sell a bunch of shit.

2430
02:33:19,049 --> 02:33:20,649
Wait, I got this wardrobe thing.

2431
02:33:20,649 --> 02:33:23,600
Let me see what it is.

2432
02:33:23,600 --> 02:33:27,129
Ooh, ugly.

2433
02:33:27,129 --> 02:33:27,969
And I don't want this.

2434
02:33:27,969 --> 02:33:38,780
Do I change?

2435
02:33:38,780 --> 02:33:43,059
No.

2436
02:33:43,059 --> 02:33:45,260
I'm not really into the wicker basket looking stuff

2437
02:33:45,260 --> 02:33:46,979
for furniture.

2438
02:33:46,979 --> 02:33:52,540
I mean, I'll keep it, but whatever.

2439
02:33:52,540 --> 02:33:56,719
Hey, Vibio Game, thanks for the 300 bits.

2440
02:33:56,719 --> 02:33:58,159
Vibio Game says, hey, Jeremy, thanks so much

2441
02:33:58,159 --> 02:34:00,659
for a fun run of streams the past few weeks.

2442
02:34:00,659 --> 02:34:02,739
I literally moved halfway around the world from home

2443
02:34:02,739 --> 02:34:05,260
just before all the virus stuff started

2444
02:34:05,260 --> 02:34:07,059
and your streams have really helped me keep

2445
02:34:07,059 --> 02:34:09,700
happy and sane during all the stress.

2446
02:34:09,700 --> 02:34:10,540
Best of luck with your move

2447
02:34:10,540 --> 02:34:13,700
and hope you keep safe and healthy.

2448
02:34:13,700 --> 02:34:17,260
Yeah, that's the worst part about moving now

2449
02:34:17,260 --> 02:34:19,979
is just, it was all planned.

2450
02:34:19,979 --> 02:34:22,299
Obviously, you try to make a plan as best you can

2451
02:34:22,299 --> 02:34:23,459
and then all this stuff started happening

2452
02:34:23,459 --> 02:34:26,370
and it's like, well, what do I do now?

2453
02:34:28,139 --> 02:34:30,579
Kim and I, we've been trying to figure out

2454
02:34:30,579 --> 02:34:32,180
the best course of action to do this

2455
02:34:32,180 --> 02:34:35,420
and stay healthy and avoid any potential issues

2456
02:34:35,420 --> 02:34:39,620
and it's just kind of tricky.

2457
02:34:39,620 --> 02:34:40,860
Game is too loud.

2458
02:34:45,809 --> 02:34:47,860
But we're gonna do our best.

2459
02:34:47,860 --> 02:34:49,790
That's all we can do.

2460
02:34:49,829 --> 02:34:52,010
Thank you, Vibio Game for the three dollars.

2461
02:34:53,540 --> 02:34:56,379
Moving halfway around the world seems like,

2462
02:34:56,379 --> 02:34:57,500
what the fuck is that thing?

2463
02:34:57,500 --> 02:34:58,540
Is this like a crater here?

2464
02:34:58,540 --> 02:35:01,299
What's this crater?

2465
02:35:01,299 --> 02:35:04,659
What is this thing?

2466
02:35:04,659 --> 02:35:10,329
Is this lava?

2467
02:35:10,329 --> 02:35:14,440
Look, I dug up a thousand bells.

2468
02:35:14,440 --> 02:35:15,280
What do I do?

2469
02:35:15,280 --> 02:35:20,280
What should I do with this?

2470
02:35:20,280 --> 02:35:22,819
Plant it back?

2471
02:35:22,819 --> 02:35:23,659
What do you mean plant it back?

2472
02:35:23,659 --> 02:35:27,069
Plant it back, bury in hole?

2473
02:35:27,069 --> 02:35:30,489
Put it back.

2474
02:35:30,489 --> 02:35:40,079
Whoa, am I gonna have a money tree?

2475
02:35:40,079 --> 02:35:40,920
Are you serious?

2476
02:35:40,920 --> 02:35:43,129
That's so cool.

2477
02:35:43,129 --> 02:35:46,920
I can actually have a money tree.

2478
02:35:46,920 --> 02:35:48,659
Wow.

2479
02:35:48,659 --> 02:35:49,500
Nice, that's cool.

2480
02:35:49,500 --> 02:35:54,049
I can't wait to see that in like nine days game time.

2481
02:35:54,049 --> 02:35:56,049
Hey John, with no H, there you are again.

2482
02:35:56,049 --> 02:35:57,969
Thanks for the 300 bits.

2483
02:35:57,969 --> 02:35:59,329
Jeremy, these are the last of my bits.

2484
02:35:59,329 --> 02:36:02,049
I'm done with the BLT joke.

2485
02:36:02,049 --> 02:36:03,409
Chat thought it was hilarious

2486
02:36:03,409 --> 02:36:06,129
and clearly your sense of humor is several levels lower

2487
02:36:06,129 --> 02:36:07,530
than mine because your initial reaction

2488
02:36:07,530 --> 02:36:09,329
was to have me timed out.

2489
02:36:09,329 --> 02:36:10,489
I love your stream and look forward

2490
02:36:10,489 --> 02:36:12,250
to the next time you use the Starbucks.

2491
02:36:12,250 --> 02:36:13,450
Yeah.

2492
02:36:13,450 --> 02:36:16,049
Yeah, my humor level is so much lower.

2493
02:36:16,090 --> 02:36:18,129
My humor level is just so,

2494
02:36:18,129 --> 02:36:20,850
like the 10 rungs down on the ladder underneath.

2495
02:36:21,850 --> 02:36:23,489
I can't even say it out loud.

2496
02:36:23,489 --> 02:36:25,690
You know what it is.

2497
02:36:25,690 --> 02:36:29,680
Make it permanent.

2498
02:36:29,680 --> 02:36:33,399
Yeah, I love, you know, let's, no, no.

2499
02:36:33,399 --> 02:36:34,719
All right, thank you.

2500
02:36:34,719 --> 02:36:39,350
See you later.

2501
02:36:39,350 --> 02:36:42,069
Thanks for the bits, I appreciate it.

2502
02:36:42,069 --> 02:36:45,280
But you've been 30 minute timed out.

2503
02:36:45,280 --> 02:36:47,520
That's right, I don't give those out that often.

2504
02:36:47,520 --> 02:36:49,840
That's a personal 30 minute timeout.

2505
02:36:50,319 --> 02:36:52,399
And not right now, on the night,

2506
02:36:52,399 --> 02:36:54,479
on the start of the, on the next,

2507
02:36:54,479 --> 02:36:57,920
on the night of the next start of the next stream,

2508
02:36:57,920 --> 02:36:59,079
it begins.

2509
02:36:59,079 --> 02:37:01,079
30 minutes for you.

2510
02:37:01,079 --> 02:37:03,120
The moment that the next stream turns on.

2511
02:37:03,120 --> 02:37:10,069
Oh, that's got to sting a little bit too, you don't it?

2512
02:37:10,069 --> 02:37:10,909
Thank you.

2513
02:37:10,909 --> 02:37:13,629
Hey, thanks, a normal user for the 300 bits.

2514
02:37:13,629 --> 02:37:19,360
Jeremy, you're stupid.

2515
02:37:19,360 --> 02:37:22,829
Thanks for the, thanks for the 300 money.

2516
02:37:22,829 --> 02:37:25,399
Thanks for the 300 bits.

2517
02:37:25,399 --> 02:37:27,079
The man with the baby hands thanks for 500 bits.

2518
02:37:27,120 --> 02:37:30,510
Of all the GameCube games you own,

2519
02:37:30,510 --> 02:37:34,659
you pick the one where you pick up trash for 90% of it.

2520
02:37:34,659 --> 02:37:36,299
That's fine.

2521
02:37:36,299 --> 02:37:38,950
What's wrong with that?

2522
02:37:38,950 --> 02:37:41,430
I wish I had a bigger net so I could catch bigger bugs.

2523
02:37:41,430 --> 02:37:42,750
Oh, what if I caught a bug so big

2524
02:37:42,750 --> 02:37:44,909
that I couldn't even lug it around?

2525
02:37:44,909 --> 02:37:48,170
I don't know.

2526
02:37:48,170 --> 02:37:53,659
Do you need a bigger net?

2527
02:37:53,659 --> 02:37:55,459
I don't know.

2528
02:37:55,459 --> 02:37:57,540
Morkus, Morkus, thanks for $30.

2529
02:37:57,540 --> 02:37:59,420
There's no message, just 30 bucks.

2530
02:37:59,420 --> 02:38:02,700
That's a big fucking drop.

2531
02:38:02,700 --> 02:38:06,700
Let me try to catch some fish here.

2532
02:38:06,700 --> 02:38:11,020
No message, just 3000 bits, just a bunch of money.

2533
02:38:11,020 --> 02:38:15,299
Thank you.

2534
02:38:15,299 --> 02:38:17,379
Come on, take it.

2535
02:38:17,379 --> 02:38:23,420
Please move the text that's fucking the animals talking.

2536
02:38:23,420 --> 02:38:28,860
Shit, you're right, here.

2537
02:38:28,860 --> 02:38:30,799
Thanks for the 30 bucks, man.

2538
02:38:30,799 --> 02:38:32,120
That's a lot of money just to give somebody

2539
02:38:32,120 --> 02:38:33,079
and there's just no messages.

2540
02:38:33,079 --> 02:38:35,579
Thanks for 30 bucks.

2541
02:38:35,579 --> 02:38:40,420
I wish I was at Olive Garden thanks for 300 bits.

2542
02:38:40,420 --> 02:38:46,909
Me too, man, me too, me too.

2543
02:38:46,909 --> 02:38:48,709
Map, map, map, map, map.

2544
02:38:53,059 --> 02:38:56,489
All right, there.

2545
02:38:56,489 --> 02:38:59,440
Kilkun, thanks for the 1000 bits.

2546
02:38:59,440 --> 02:39:00,959
I don't watch movies, I don't listen to music,

2547
02:39:00,959 --> 02:39:02,479
I don't watch TV.

2548
02:39:02,479 --> 02:39:04,520
What do you do to pass the time when not streaming?

2549
02:39:04,520 --> 02:39:06,000
Walk auto for three days?

2550
02:39:06,879 --> 02:39:08,399
No, talk into the mirror and pretend

2551
02:39:08,399 --> 02:39:10,559
that I'm in an Academy Award-winning movie.

2552
02:39:12,860 --> 02:39:21,299
I come up with, yeah, I make up my own TV shows in my mirror.

2553
02:39:21,299 --> 02:39:22,139
It's true?

2554
02:39:22,139 --> 02:39:23,819
You don't think it's true?

2555
02:39:23,819 --> 02:39:25,059
That's fine.

2556
02:39:25,059 --> 02:39:28,569
Oh, that's depressing.

2557
02:39:42,340 --> 02:39:45,479
I watch movie and TV shows.

2558
02:39:45,479 --> 02:39:51,260
Just not those five Universal Studios movies.

2559
02:39:51,260 --> 02:39:53,780
Thank you Keta Meme for the 255.

2560
02:39:53,780 --> 02:39:55,860
Would you say you're a boomer, zoomer, doomer, zoomer,

2561
02:39:55,860 --> 02:39:57,100
or the other one?

2562
02:39:59,299 --> 02:40:03,579
I'm just a, I'm a guy that fucking, I'm a guy.

2563
02:40:03,579 --> 02:40:05,020
That's it.

2564
02:40:05,020 --> 02:40:09,290
I'm a fucking millennial, okay?

2565
02:40:09,290 --> 02:40:12,090
I'm none of those things that you just described.

2566
02:40:12,090 --> 02:40:15,370
A crunch, thanks for the 300 bits.

2567
02:40:15,370 --> 02:40:17,649
First time donating a Twitch, hope I'm doing this right.

2568
02:40:17,649 --> 02:40:19,780
Seems like you are.

2569
02:40:19,780 --> 02:40:23,159
Anyways, since we brought up ET in the stream,

2570
02:40:23,159 --> 02:40:25,239
I'm taking the opportunity to bring up the official

2571
02:40:25,239 --> 02:40:27,680
Rushton ET doll when the movie came out.

2572
02:40:27,680 --> 02:40:29,399
They're so great and fucked up

2573
02:40:29,399 --> 02:40:32,200
and I'm lucky enough to have found one to own.

2574
02:40:32,200 --> 02:40:37,700
Wait, what?

2575
02:40:37,700 --> 02:40:41,319
This is supposed to be ET?

2576
02:40:41,319 --> 02:41:01,739
How the fuck is this ET?

2577
02:41:01,739 --> 02:41:03,579
That's ET.

2578
02:41:03,579 --> 02:41:05,590
Okay.

2579
02:41:05,590 --> 02:41:11,379
It seems impossible.

2580
02:41:11,379 --> 02:41:14,530
Bug, get the net, get the net, get the net.

2581
02:41:14,530 --> 02:41:15,489
I don't think I've seen this one yet.

2582
02:41:15,489 --> 02:41:20,659
This is like, this is a multi, I'm so bad at catching bugs.

2583
02:41:20,819 --> 02:41:21,659
It's depressing.

2584
02:41:22,860 --> 02:41:23,700
There we go.

2585
02:41:24,340 --> 02:41:32,059
So, thanks to the ET doll.

2586
02:41:32,059 --> 02:41:34,170
Thanks for the 300 bits.

2587
02:41:34,170 --> 02:41:35,850
Esparta Escalada, thanks for 250.

2588
02:41:35,850 --> 02:41:38,889
This is me watching you taking that quiz

2589
02:41:38,889 --> 02:41:41,770
over and over again.

2590
02:41:41,770 --> 02:41:43,729
Over for four seconds.

2591
02:41:43,729 --> 02:41:45,049
Did I get this one yet?

2592
02:41:45,049 --> 02:41:47,219
What is it?

2593
02:41:47,219 --> 02:41:49,700
Shut them ragtime music off.

2594
02:41:49,700 --> 02:41:54,739
This is like I live at Steakies Pizza.

2595
02:41:54,739 --> 02:41:56,950
Aquatine Hunger Force.

2596
02:41:56,950 --> 02:41:58,110
Good show.

2597
02:41:58,110 --> 02:41:59,870
Balloon, balloon, streamer alert.

2598
02:41:59,870 --> 02:42:01,870
Streamer alert, balloon, streamer alert,

2599
02:42:01,870 --> 02:42:03,989
streamer alert, streamer alert.

2600
02:42:04,829 --> 02:42:06,270
Alert.

2601
02:42:06,270 --> 02:42:08,549
I got it, I got it, I know I saw it.

2602
02:42:08,549 --> 02:42:11,270
First shot, second shot, guaranteed.

2603
02:42:11,270 --> 02:42:12,950
Third shot, guaranteed or I will never

2604
02:42:12,950 --> 02:42:14,469
stream on Twitch again, ever.

2605
02:42:14,469 --> 02:42:20,399
I will never stream again if I don't hit this right now.

2606
02:42:20,399 --> 02:42:28,520
Okay.

2607
02:42:28,520 --> 02:42:30,989
Pedal board?

2608
02:42:30,989 --> 02:42:35,620
What the fuck is a pedal board?

2609
02:42:35,620 --> 02:42:48,809
Wait, this is like a DJ table?

2610
02:42:48,809 --> 02:42:54,350
If I leave this out, is somebody gonna steal it?

2611
02:42:54,350 --> 02:42:55,190
Oh, cool.

2612
02:42:55,190 --> 02:42:57,430
Let's check my pedal board.

2613
02:42:57,430 --> 02:43:08,450
Achoo, achoo, achoo, achoo.

2614
02:43:08,450 --> 02:43:11,129
Hey, Friedl Schnitz.

2615
02:43:11,129 --> 02:43:12,209
Thanks for the 250.

2616
02:43:12,209 --> 02:43:13,170
Pleased with the love of God.

2617
02:43:13,170 --> 02:43:14,250
Watch Back to the Future.

2618
02:43:14,250 --> 02:43:16,049
I can't, not now.

2619
02:43:16,049 --> 02:43:18,200
Some other day.

2620
02:43:18,200 --> 02:43:19,399
Peaceful Haley, thanks for 250.

2621
02:43:19,399 --> 02:43:21,079
So you've never seen ET or Back to the Future,

2622
02:43:21,079 --> 02:43:23,600
but you've seen the shitty comedy Twins.

2623
02:43:23,600 --> 02:43:24,639
You are unbelievable.

2624
02:43:24,639 --> 02:43:27,159
Also, hope your penis is okay.

2625
02:43:27,159 --> 02:43:35,940
What?

2626
02:43:35,940 --> 02:43:36,780
What is it?

2627
02:43:36,780 --> 02:43:39,760
Oh my God.

2628
02:43:39,760 --> 02:43:42,719
Twins is a, I would rather watch Twins

2629
02:43:42,719 --> 02:43:43,639
than I can't say that.

2630
02:43:43,639 --> 02:43:45,799
Somebody will fucking probably murder me.

2631
02:43:46,959 --> 02:43:51,760
Twins is a cool movie.

2632
02:43:51,760 --> 02:43:53,360
Oh, the controller, right, right, right, right.

2633
02:43:53,360 --> 02:43:55,159
Let me sell this bugger.

2634
02:43:55,159 --> 02:43:56,200
Sell everything.

2635
02:43:56,200 --> 02:43:58,069
Sell it all.

2636
02:43:58,069 --> 02:44:01,399
Thank you, Peaceful Haley, appreciate it.

2637
02:44:01,399 --> 02:44:06,989
We also had Goiki5, more dolls from Goiki.

2638
02:44:06,989 --> 02:44:10,260
Thank you, Goiki.

2639
02:44:10,260 --> 02:44:12,700
Do you ever get the Tetris effect after you stream?

2640
02:44:12,700 --> 02:44:14,020
It's when you play a video game so much

2641
02:44:14,020 --> 02:44:17,079
when you see it when you close your eyes.

2642
02:44:17,079 --> 02:44:20,149
It happens to me all the time when I play Tetris.

2643
02:44:20,149 --> 02:44:21,510
Not really, that only happened.

2644
02:44:21,549 --> 02:44:24,979
It used to happen when I played Diablo 2,

2645
02:44:24,979 --> 02:44:30,260
but not anything recently.

2646
02:44:30,260 --> 02:44:31,940
Not anything recently.

2647
02:44:31,940 --> 02:44:37,510
I missed bits, what are you talking about, where?

2648
02:44:37,510 --> 02:44:40,799
Missed bits, missed bits, what are you talking about?

2649
02:44:40,799 --> 02:44:43,260
When, when, where?

2650
02:44:43,260 --> 02:44:51,889
What happened?

2651
02:44:51,889 --> 02:45:00,709
I got everybody so far.

2652
02:45:00,709 --> 02:45:09,180
Yeah, I got everybody so far.

2653
02:45:09,180 --> 02:45:10,899
According to my dashboard,

2654
02:45:10,899 --> 02:45:14,340
this is the list just going from bottom to top.

2655
02:45:20,799 --> 02:45:27,690
Yeah, what are you talking about?

2656
02:45:27,690 --> 02:45:31,780
Did they just come in?

2657
02:45:31,780 --> 02:45:35,420
Yeah, I'm going in descending order here.

2658
02:45:38,819 --> 02:45:44,420
This is how, what?

2659
02:45:44,420 --> 02:45:49,549
I'm going, these are bits from like three or four hours ago.

2660
02:45:49,549 --> 02:45:51,430
I'll get to it eventually, I'm gonna get there.

2661
02:45:51,430 --> 02:45:57,620
I'm gonna get there.

2662
02:45:57,620 --> 02:46:03,780
You skipped it already, they're not here.

2663
02:46:03,780 --> 02:46:18,700
I just, I'm refreshing, I don't see anything.

2664
02:46:20,049 --> 02:46:23,889
Not right, not where I am right now.

2665
02:46:23,889 --> 02:46:29,770
There's nothing here from like three or four hours ago.

2666
02:46:29,770 --> 02:46:35,159
Let's see if they pop up.

2667
02:46:35,159 --> 02:46:37,420
Let's see if they pop up eventually here.

2668
02:46:37,420 --> 02:46:40,409
But, let's keep going.

2669
02:46:40,409 --> 02:46:47,180
We left off right here, the Tetris effect.

2670
02:46:47,180 --> 02:46:51,059
That was Goiki for the Tetris effect.

2671
02:46:51,059 --> 02:46:52,299
Tar Alecron, thanks for 250.

2672
02:46:52,299 --> 02:46:55,059
Jeremy, you always backdate your Switch system.

2673
02:46:55,059 --> 02:46:57,889
You can always backdate your Switch until next week

2674
02:46:57,889 --> 02:47:00,370
so the game wouldn't realize that you hadn't played all week.

2675
02:47:00,370 --> 02:47:02,729
That way you could just resume like normal on stream

2676
02:47:02,729 --> 02:47:05,350
like it had only been one day.

2677
02:47:05,350 --> 02:47:09,620
I'd better rather just do it the way it's intended.

2678
02:47:09,620 --> 02:47:11,440
I'd rather do it the way it's intended.

2679
02:47:11,440 --> 02:47:14,120
Play it once a day.

2680
02:47:14,120 --> 02:47:15,840
Your text is blocking the bells.

2681
02:47:15,840 --> 02:47:19,959
It's fine, I wanna sell.

2682
02:47:28,100 --> 02:47:28,899
I'd rather just play it the way

2683
02:47:28,899 --> 02:47:33,860
it's normally intended to be played, you know.

2684
02:47:33,860 --> 02:47:38,850
I sell the coin, no, I gotta donate that one.

2685
02:47:38,850 --> 02:47:49,309
I can sell him a coconut tree, what the fuck?

2686
02:47:49,309 --> 02:47:52,790
9200 bells, holy shit.

2687
02:47:52,790 --> 02:47:54,780
That's a lot.

2688
02:47:54,780 --> 02:47:56,260
Spliceable Spleen, thanks for five dollars.

2689
02:47:56,260 --> 02:47:58,180
Hey Jerma, I saw a white Honda Civic

2690
02:47:58,180 --> 02:47:59,219
driving around Vegas the other day

2691
02:47:59,219 --> 02:48:00,899
with a license plate, Jerma's.

2692
02:48:00,899 --> 02:48:03,579
Can you confirm or deny that this was you?

2693
02:48:05,569 --> 02:48:08,799
Not me.

2694
02:48:08,799 --> 02:48:12,079
Also, I live near Henderson in the Las Vegas Valley.

2695
02:48:12,079 --> 02:48:13,840
Is that where you're headed in Vegas?

2696
02:48:13,840 --> 02:48:15,600
Thanks for all the quality content, man.

2697
02:48:15,600 --> 02:48:18,569
Best on your move.

2698
02:48:18,569 --> 02:48:21,379
There's a lot of places in Las Vegas.

2699
02:48:21,379 --> 02:48:24,659
A lot of places in Vegas, people to live

2700
02:48:24,700 --> 02:48:25,899
if they wanna live in places.

2701
02:48:25,899 --> 02:48:28,350
A lot of great places in Vegas.

2702
02:48:28,350 --> 02:48:30,030
A lot of people, about three million people

2703
02:48:30,030 --> 02:48:33,969
live in Las Vegas.

2704
02:48:33,969 --> 02:48:35,819
There's a lot of great places.

2705
02:48:35,819 --> 02:48:45,639
Thanks for the bits, appreciate that.

2706
02:48:45,639 --> 02:48:48,280
Actually, there are a lot of great places in Vegas.

2707
02:48:48,280 --> 02:48:49,639
He's turning into Trump.

2708
02:48:51,959 --> 02:48:53,959
There's a lot of great places in Vegas.

2709
02:48:53,959 --> 02:48:55,959
Beautiful places, wonderful places.

2710
02:48:55,959 --> 02:48:58,879
All the places in Vegas are great.

2711
02:48:58,879 --> 02:49:05,299
Is that close or far away from an Olive Garden?

2712
02:49:05,299 --> 02:49:10,299
Thank you, SpliceableSpleen, for the five dollars.

2713
02:49:10,299 --> 02:49:13,739
Hey, Kill, KillKun, thanks for five more dollars.

2714
02:49:13,739 --> 02:49:17,579
Are Poli-Politan Cuddles moving with you too?

2715
02:49:17,579 --> 02:49:18,979
No.

2716
02:49:18,979 --> 02:49:20,340
Tara Ollikorn, thanks for 250.

2717
02:49:20,340 --> 02:49:22,500
The odds that Jerma manages to move to a new house

2718
02:49:22,500 --> 02:49:24,020
set up as an internet properly

2719
02:49:24,020 --> 02:49:27,219
and find the motivation to stream is less than 0%.

2720
02:49:27,219 --> 02:49:29,379
If Jerma streams a real stream next Saturday,

2721
02:49:29,379 --> 02:49:32,750
I will give him permission to personally ban me for life.

2722
02:49:32,750 --> 02:49:35,510
I am, you've been around for a long time.

2723
02:49:35,510 --> 02:49:37,149
You've been around for a very long time,

2724
02:49:37,149 --> 02:49:40,059
but I do have to tell you something right now.

2725
02:49:40,139 --> 02:49:42,139
There are quite a few contingency plans.

2726
02:49:42,139 --> 02:49:44,379
If the internet does not work,

2727
02:49:46,700 --> 02:49:48,700
I will be streaming on Saturday.

2728
02:49:48,700 --> 02:49:50,579
You're about to be banned for life.

2729
02:49:50,579 --> 02:49:53,829
You've been around for like seven straight years.

2730
02:49:53,829 --> 02:49:57,670
So, I'm sorry, but we have to commit to this.

2731
02:49:57,670 --> 02:49:58,870
If I'm not live on Saturday,

2732
02:49:58,870 --> 02:49:59,950
then you're gonna get permanently banned.

2733
02:49:59,950 --> 02:50:05,979
You're gonna have to come back as Tara Ollikorn too.

2734
02:50:05,979 --> 02:50:07,379
I will be streaming on Saturday.

2735
02:50:07,379 --> 02:50:10,899
Like without question, less than 0%.

2736
02:50:10,899 --> 02:50:14,379
It is going to be 100%, 100%.

2737
02:50:14,379 --> 02:50:19,860
I will be live on Saturday, 100%.

2738
02:50:19,860 --> 02:50:20,700
I just made that.

2739
02:50:20,700 --> 02:50:25,059
Have fun being number three, you dick.

2740
02:50:25,059 --> 02:50:26,059
Thanks for the 250 though,

2741
02:50:26,059 --> 02:50:28,899
and have fun with your permanent ban.

2742
02:50:28,899 --> 02:50:32,860
Can't wait to see Tara Ollikorn 79,

2743
02:50:32,860 --> 02:50:34,659
or whatever the hell you're gonna have to make now.

2744
02:50:34,659 --> 02:50:36,979
Glow in the dark stars, thanks for $5.

2745
02:50:36,979 --> 02:50:41,659
He, hey, he sent a message earlier,

2746
02:50:41,659 --> 02:50:44,139
but it's a birthday from Lizard Amiibo.

2747
02:50:44,139 --> 02:50:46,180
It's Andy's birthday on the 25th.

2748
02:50:46,180 --> 02:50:47,819
He's an incredible dude and a fantastic friend.

2749
02:50:47,819 --> 02:50:49,020
He got me into watching your streams

2750
02:50:49,020 --> 02:50:51,459
and his friends wanted him to hear happy birthday again

2751
02:50:51,459 --> 02:50:53,100
from his favorite streamer.

2752
02:50:53,100 --> 02:50:56,950
Happy fucking birthday.

2753
02:50:56,950 --> 02:51:01,329
Happy birthday, Andy.

2754
02:51:01,329 --> 02:51:02,930
Thanks for the $5 glow in the dark stars.

2755
02:51:02,930 --> 02:51:03,930
Hope you have a good one.

2756
02:51:03,930 --> 02:51:07,100
Coming up.

2757
02:51:07,100 --> 02:51:09,959
Luigi man, thanks for 255 minutes into 30 minutes low mode.

2758
02:51:09,959 --> 02:51:19,110
I'm starving, please help.

2759
02:51:19,110 --> 02:51:20,389
You asked for this.

2760
02:51:20,389 --> 02:51:22,780
You guys wanted this shit.

2761
02:51:22,780 --> 02:51:26,579
Let me go look at the shopping center.

2762
02:51:26,579 --> 02:51:32,219
RTX42069TI, what a fucking unbelievable name.

2763
02:51:32,219 --> 02:51:42,399
Utility sync, I want one.

2764
02:51:42,399 --> 02:51:43,479
And I want a drying rack too.

2765
02:51:43,479 --> 02:51:44,319
No, I don't.

2766
02:51:44,319 --> 02:51:47,780
Why the fuck would I want one of those?

2767
02:51:47,780 --> 02:51:48,620
You say, hey Jeremy,

2768
02:51:48,620 --> 02:51:51,100
I'm happy you're branching out and playing City Skylines.

2769
02:51:51,100 --> 02:51:53,299
Just keep in mind that the City Skyline community swears

2770
02:51:53,299 --> 02:51:58,219
by absolute perfectionism and efficiency in design.

2771
02:51:58,219 --> 02:51:59,860
Oh, I know.

2772
02:51:59,860 --> 02:52:03,559
I know.

2773
02:52:03,559 --> 02:52:05,899
Oh, I know.

2774
02:52:05,899 --> 02:52:08,340
With some practice, I know you can become a loved mayor.

2775
02:52:08,340 --> 02:52:10,200
I think Chad is just mean.

2776
02:52:10,200 --> 02:52:11,959
You made a lot of progress over the last few streams.

2777
02:52:11,959 --> 02:52:13,399
I hope you play more of this game

2778
02:52:13,399 --> 02:52:28,370
and it's not just a 100 plus dollar joke.

2779
02:52:28,370 --> 02:52:33,370
Baby's first city builder is what you have to understand.

2780
02:52:33,370 --> 02:52:34,850
All right, that's the first time I ever played

2781
02:52:34,850 --> 02:52:37,549
any game like that.

2782
02:52:37,549 --> 02:52:43,659
No, my roads aren't gonna be fucking all at 90 degrees.

2783
02:52:43,940 --> 02:52:47,450
Some of you guys need to take a fucking bath, you know?

2784
02:52:47,450 --> 02:52:50,360
You need to take a bath with some Epsom salts in there

2785
02:52:50,360 --> 02:52:56,909
and just soak for a little bit.

2786
02:52:56,909 --> 02:52:59,420
I'm a more of a shower guy.

2787
02:52:59,420 --> 02:53:04,700
Should I pay this loan down for 10 grand?

2788
02:53:04,700 --> 02:53:09,579
I'll do 10,000 on it.

2789
02:53:09,579 --> 02:53:12,590
8600 lit, 36,000 lit.

2790
02:53:12,590 --> 02:53:15,459
All right, now I'm gonna deposit this money.

2791
02:53:15,459 --> 02:53:17,100
I get to play with like a bank account.

2792
02:53:17,100 --> 02:53:20,260
Look at this.

2793
02:53:20,260 --> 02:53:23,180
16,417, cool.

2794
02:53:23,180 --> 02:53:24,020
Hope you play more of it.

2795
02:53:24,020 --> 02:53:26,329
Um, I don't know, maybe.

2796
02:53:26,329 --> 02:53:29,379
Maybe, it depends.

2797
02:53:29,379 --> 02:53:33,280
I'd wanna get some mods for it or something.

2798
02:53:33,280 --> 02:53:34,760
Oh, I never got the hairstyles.

2799
02:53:34,760 --> 02:53:36,329
People are gonna be mad.

2800
02:53:36,329 --> 02:53:45,360
It's okay, it's okay.

2801
02:53:45,360 --> 02:53:47,280
But thank you to Rock Writing for the 300 bits.

2802
02:53:47,280 --> 02:53:49,360
Now realizing Jerma's villager,

2803
02:53:49,360 --> 02:53:55,639
walking around in an eye mask that resembles a maxi pad.

2804
02:53:55,639 --> 02:53:58,950
That's, that's like a,

2805
02:53:58,950 --> 02:54:00,309
is actually a nice metaphor for him

2806
02:54:00,309 --> 02:54:01,930
blindly bumbling around in the game,

2807
02:54:01,930 --> 02:54:03,290
but in the purest way possible.

2808
02:54:03,290 --> 02:54:06,909
Cool watching someone play AC for the first time.

2809
02:54:06,909 --> 02:54:07,750
And then we stay safe.

2810
02:54:07,750 --> 02:54:10,030
Everyone wishing on auto a peaceful move.

2811
02:54:10,030 --> 02:54:11,440
Thank you.

2812
02:54:11,440 --> 02:54:13,479
And thanks for imprint,

2813
02:54:13,479 --> 02:54:15,399
implanting that image into my brain

2814
02:54:15,399 --> 02:54:16,520
that I will never remove.

2815
02:54:16,520 --> 02:54:18,719
Until I remove this from my eyes.

2816
02:54:18,719 --> 02:54:22,530
Which will be later after this stream is over.

2817
02:54:22,530 --> 02:54:25,129
All right, what do I wanna do now before I leave?

2818
02:54:25,129 --> 02:54:25,969
Is that enough?

2819
02:54:25,969 --> 02:54:27,290
I think I did enough.

2820
02:54:27,290 --> 02:54:29,549
I can't really do much anymore.

2821
02:54:29,549 --> 02:54:32,059
Until tomorrow.

2822
02:54:32,059 --> 02:54:35,780
Okay, let's call it.

2823
02:54:35,780 --> 02:54:39,149
I, let me make sure the game's saved.

2824
02:54:39,149 --> 02:54:42,069
I will see you guys on Saturday,

2825
02:54:42,069 --> 02:54:44,190
guaranteed.

2826
02:54:44,190 --> 02:54:49,370
I don't care if I have to stream from my cell phone.

2827
02:54:49,370 --> 02:54:51,079
That guy's getting banned.

2828
02:54:51,079 --> 02:54:52,920
I'll make sure of it.

2829
02:54:52,920 --> 02:54:59,579
So let's actually do the actual wind down screen

2830
02:54:59,579 --> 02:55:06,020
and move there.

2831
02:55:06,020 --> 02:55:07,700
It's, it's, I'm not done.

2832
02:55:07,700 --> 02:55:11,600
Why do you guys, what's going on tonight?

2833
02:55:11,600 --> 02:55:13,159
This is how we do this every night.

2834
02:55:13,159 --> 02:55:22,170
What's going on here?

2835
02:55:22,170 --> 02:55:24,129
I'm a quick read, read, read, read, read, read, read.

2836
02:55:24,129 --> 02:55:37,829
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

2837
02:55:37,829 --> 02:55:42,620
That's just the same.

2838
02:55:42,620 --> 02:55:45,989
All right, anyways, let's keep going.

2839
02:55:45,989 --> 02:55:50,370
Thank you to a literal fraud of 500 bits.

2840
02:55:50,370 --> 02:55:52,409
Jerma, we're gonna need to talk about this sneeze joke.

2841
02:55:52,409 --> 02:55:53,690
Man, it's not funny.

2842
02:55:53,690 --> 02:55:55,489
We need to realize that it's not funny.

2843
02:55:55,489 --> 02:55:56,329
It hasn't been funny.

2844
02:55:56,329 --> 02:55:59,850
Please, we're trying to get it through to you.

2845
02:55:59,850 --> 02:56:01,209
I thought it was funny.

2846
02:56:01,209 --> 02:56:04,709
I'm gonna keep pressing that fucking button

2847
02:56:04,709 --> 02:56:08,590
until the day I die.

2848
02:56:08,590 --> 02:56:09,950
Ozals, thanks for the 300 bits.

2849
02:56:09,950 --> 02:56:12,469
Hey, Jeremy, Olive Garden music one guy here.

2850
02:56:13,950 --> 02:56:15,790
Just wanted to say thanks for reading my shitty joke

2851
02:56:15,790 --> 02:56:18,149
and turning it into an amazing one guy moment.

2852
02:56:18,149 --> 02:56:21,510
Can we get one last BB unit before you move?

2853
02:56:21,510 --> 02:56:29,879
God.

2854
02:56:29,879 --> 02:56:35,709
All right, okay.

2855
02:56:35,709 --> 02:56:37,389
I'll get, this is gonna be the, I'm gonna give it to you.

2856
02:56:37,389 --> 02:56:41,760
This is gonna be so, I'm gonna do as hard as I can.

2857
02:56:50,629 --> 02:57:34,780
I just want to see.

2858
02:57:34,780 --> 02:57:38,139
That's like, I clenched so hard doing that.

2859
02:57:38,139 --> 02:57:38,979
There you go.

2860
02:57:38,979 --> 02:58:01,659
I'm never doing that ever again.

2861
02:58:01,659 --> 02:58:26,709
Okay, God damn it.

2862
02:58:26,709 --> 02:58:28,629
Hey, eggs scramble, thanks for the 250.

2863
02:58:28,629 --> 02:58:29,510
Hey Jerma, great stream.

2864
02:58:29,510 --> 02:58:31,389
You looked very nice and handsome today.

2865
02:58:31,389 --> 02:58:33,850
Thanks.

2866
02:58:33,850 --> 02:58:35,850
I know eating enough healthy food

2867
02:58:35,850 --> 02:58:37,930
can be really tough during busy times.

2868
02:58:37,930 --> 02:58:40,850
Chorizo, eggs, tortillas, white onions,

2869
02:58:40,850 --> 02:58:43,370
couscous, Swiss chard, gold potatoes, hummus,

2870
02:58:43,370 --> 02:58:45,370
Ezekiel bread, walnuts, ground turkey.

2871
02:58:45,409 --> 02:58:46,290
Have a good week, man.

2872
02:58:46,290 --> 02:58:47,129
Stay hydrated.

2873
02:58:47,129 --> 02:58:51,209
What the fuck are you talking about?

2874
02:58:51,209 --> 02:58:53,250
Those are all delicious things,

2875
02:58:53,250 --> 02:58:57,979
but why are they all in a row?

2876
02:58:57,979 --> 02:59:00,180
Hey Spooky Fox, thanks for five dollars.

2877
02:59:00,180 --> 02:59:02,059
Here, me and my girlfriend are watching tonight

2878
02:59:02,059 --> 02:59:04,579
and I've been watching since like 2013.

2879
02:59:04,579 --> 02:59:06,860
She's really excited you're playing

2880
02:59:06,860 --> 02:59:10,850
Assassin's Animal Crossing.

2881
02:59:10,850 --> 02:59:11,850
I love you and your stuff

2882
02:59:11,850 --> 02:59:14,010
and also said girlfriend is thinking

2883
02:59:14,010 --> 02:59:15,409
of getting some rats at some point

2884
02:59:15,409 --> 02:59:20,549
and if she does, she might name one after you.

2885
02:59:20,549 --> 02:59:22,899
I'm honored.

2886
02:59:22,899 --> 02:59:24,819
I am honored.

2887
02:59:24,819 --> 02:59:29,229
I would love to be named after a rat, especially yours.

2888
02:59:29,229 --> 02:59:31,219
Thanks for the five dollars.

2889
02:59:31,219 --> 02:59:34,409
Jeremy the Rat.

2890
02:59:34,409 --> 02:59:37,969
That's okay, that's more of a name that you have

2891
02:59:37,969 --> 02:59:40,399
when you get beat up in prison

2892
02:59:40,399 --> 02:59:48,659
than a name that it would be for an animal,

2893
02:59:48,659 --> 02:59:52,850
but you know, thank you though.

2894
02:59:52,850 --> 02:59:55,250
Hey Keith King Crimson, thanks for the 250.

2895
02:59:55,250 --> 02:59:56,370
Most of the characters in Jojo

2896
02:59:56,370 --> 02:59:58,329
are named after music references.

2897
02:59:58,329 --> 02:59:59,809
Killer Queen is one of them.

2898
02:59:59,809 --> 03:00:02,930
Also the pro strat is to name yourself a Jojo reference

2899
03:00:02,930 --> 03:00:05,889
so Jermis says it out loud every time you donate.

2900
03:00:05,889 --> 03:00:08,540
Oh, I guess that makes sense then.

2901
03:00:08,540 --> 03:00:10,500
That's what your name is.

2902
03:00:10,500 --> 03:00:14,100
Keith King Crimson is the name of that person

2903
03:00:14,100 --> 03:00:18,219
that's in Jojo's, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.

2904
03:00:18,219 --> 03:00:22,229
Jojo's, I can hear myself talk now.

2905
03:00:22,229 --> 03:00:28,639
Jojo, Jojer, thanks.

2906
03:00:28,639 --> 03:00:30,239
I promised I would never do that again.

2907
03:00:30,239 --> 03:00:31,399
I didn't say I would stop streaming

2908
03:00:31,399 --> 03:00:35,590
if I did that again, right?

2909
03:00:35,590 --> 03:00:38,340
That wasn't part of the deal?

2910
03:00:38,500 --> 03:00:41,059
No, it wasn't, okay, good.

2911
03:00:41,059 --> 03:00:42,620
Hey Spunky Spade, there you are.

2912
03:00:42,620 --> 03:00:44,899
Thanks for the thousand bits.

2913
03:00:44,899 --> 03:00:46,459
Hey Jerm, I hope you're not mad at me

2914
03:00:46,459 --> 03:00:48,739
selling every drawing you've done in Animal Crossing.

2915
03:00:48,739 --> 03:00:49,739
I'm broke, but here's the bits

2916
03:00:49,739 --> 03:00:51,500
equal to the money I made from it.

2917
03:00:58,610 --> 03:01:01,729
Wait, are you the red bubble guy?

2918
03:01:01,729 --> 03:01:03,659
Are you the red bubble guy?

2919
03:01:03,659 --> 03:01:05,780
Are you the guy with like 300 listings?

2920
03:01:13,319 --> 03:01:15,379
It's him.

2921
03:01:15,379 --> 03:01:16,819
We got him.

2922
03:01:16,819 --> 03:01:18,379
It's him.

2923
03:01:18,379 --> 03:01:20,020
It's the red bubble guy.

2924
03:01:23,260 --> 03:01:27,479
Ha, we found him.

2925
03:01:27,479 --> 03:01:28,719
He outed himself.

2926
03:01:28,719 --> 03:01:36,299
We didn't have to do anything.

2927
03:01:36,299 --> 03:01:38,899
The, I'm the, hey, hey Jerm,

2928
03:01:38,899 --> 03:01:40,059
hey Jerm, we just wanted to let you know

2929
03:01:40,059 --> 03:01:46,180
I'm the red bubble guy, first and foremost.

2930
03:01:46,180 --> 03:01:48,059
Hey, thanks for the 10 bucks though.

2931
03:01:48,059 --> 03:01:55,469
Thank you.

2932
03:01:55,469 --> 03:01:57,350
Bulbaswag Desu, thanks for the five dollars.

2933
03:01:57,350 --> 03:01:58,870
Can you move the elephant on the right

2934
03:01:58,870 --> 03:02:00,629
one space to the right, please?

2935
03:02:01,829 --> 03:02:03,510
It's probably bad looking, it's okay.

2936
03:02:03,510 --> 03:02:05,799
I'll do it, I promise.

2937
03:02:05,799 --> 03:02:07,760
Hey Grave Embrace, thanks for three bucks.

2938
03:02:07,760 --> 03:02:10,719
Disney claimed a parody video depicting Bugs Bunny

2939
03:02:11,399 --> 03:02:12,239
as a, what?

2940
03:02:17,680 --> 03:02:26,930
What the fuck?

2941
03:02:26,930 --> 03:02:31,030
Okay, that's fucked up.

2942
03:02:31,030 --> 03:02:34,010
Thanks for the 300 bits.

2943
03:02:34,010 --> 03:02:35,770
Hey Celestial Maid, thanks for 300 bits.

2944
03:02:35,770 --> 03:02:38,209
Hey Jerma, I heard you generate electricity

2945
03:02:38,209 --> 03:02:40,049
and miniature lightning bolts while walking.

2946
03:02:40,049 --> 03:02:41,780
Is that true?

2947
03:02:41,780 --> 03:02:51,170
If it was, I'd probably be on the cover of Time Magazine.

2948
03:02:51,170 --> 03:02:54,739
The guy that can create electricity with his hands?

2949
03:02:54,739 --> 03:02:55,579
I'd be on there.

2950
03:03:05,739 --> 03:03:08,620
Hey Sammy Lant, thanks for the 300 bits.

2951
03:03:08,620 --> 03:03:11,620
I made something to help you with rocks.

2952
03:03:11,620 --> 03:03:19,709
This is a little chart for me.

2953
03:03:19,709 --> 03:03:21,700
Thank you.

2954
03:03:21,700 --> 03:03:27,209
A little rock chart?

2955
03:03:27,209 --> 03:03:30,500
You say that as if you're not gonna be on Time Magazine

2956
03:03:30,500 --> 03:03:33,459
as best streamer, I mean remember the carnival stream?

2957
03:03:33,459 --> 03:03:35,139
Yeah, but that's already over with.

2958
03:03:35,139 --> 03:03:40,139
Don't you go, guys, the internet has a memory

2959
03:03:40,819 --> 03:03:43,190
of about four days.

2960
03:03:43,190 --> 03:03:44,709
We gotta go, we gotta do more.

2961
03:03:44,709 --> 03:03:48,899
We gotta do more shit.

2962
03:03:48,899 --> 03:03:58,479
Time Magazine's already moved on from that.

2963
03:03:58,479 --> 03:04:00,000
If I'm gonna get on the cover of Time Magazine,

2964
03:04:00,000 --> 03:04:01,280
I'm gonna start to figure out

2965
03:04:01,280 --> 03:04:09,979
how to make electricity with my hands.

2966
03:04:09,979 --> 03:04:15,809
But thank you, Sammy Lant, for the 300 bits.

2967
03:04:15,809 --> 03:04:18,090
Toasty Knight, thanks for the 400 bits.

2968
03:04:18,090 --> 03:04:29,739
They say a-choo, a-choo, thanks for the 400 bits.

2969
03:04:33,420 --> 03:04:35,979
Hey John with no H for 500 bits.

2970
03:04:35,979 --> 03:04:37,500
It's the BLT guy again.

2971
03:04:37,500 --> 03:04:38,620
Hey Jerma, just want to apologize

2972
03:04:38,620 --> 03:04:41,020
for my statements earlier regarding a BLT.

2973
03:04:41,020 --> 03:04:42,979
I don't think I mentioned that,

2974
03:04:42,979 --> 03:04:48,969
well now you are getting banned.

2975
03:04:48,969 --> 03:04:54,319
It's like, you're hanging by a thread over like the cliff

2976
03:04:54,319 --> 03:04:55,920
and like I'm pulling you up

2977
03:04:55,920 --> 03:04:57,920
and there's like three other people

2978
03:04:57,920 --> 03:04:59,239
and I'm gonna pull you all up.

2979
03:04:59,239 --> 03:05:01,399
Oh no, I'm not strong enough.

2980
03:05:01,399 --> 03:05:02,559
I got you all, don't worry.

2981
03:05:02,559 --> 03:05:04,000
I think I can, no, one of us,

2982
03:05:04,000 --> 03:05:05,360
you have to let one of us go.

2983
03:05:05,360 --> 03:05:09,979
You just looked up and said, short streamer,

2984
03:05:09,979 --> 03:05:11,379
I'm gonna let you go.

2985
03:05:11,379 --> 03:05:15,149
I'm gonna be like, that's the guy I'm letting go.

2986
03:05:15,149 --> 03:05:27,299
Like you just made my decision so much easier.

2987
03:05:27,780 --> 03:05:32,200
You don't want me to have to use my like super strength

2988
03:05:32,200 --> 03:05:33,159
and pull everybody up.

2989
03:05:33,159 --> 03:05:35,799
All right, fine.

2990
03:05:35,799 --> 03:05:38,989
You're not big enough to save all three of us.

2991
03:05:38,989 --> 03:05:41,959
Well, you would be let go too.

2992
03:05:41,959 --> 03:05:47,549
You would, how many ropes do I have over the edge here?

2993
03:05:47,549 --> 03:05:49,389
Am I gonna have to let go of all of you?

2994
03:05:49,389 --> 03:05:51,780
Who am I pulling up here?

2995
03:05:51,780 --> 03:05:53,819
If you were holding onto the rope,

2996
03:05:53,819 --> 03:05:55,100
you're not gonna do this.

2997
03:05:55,100 --> 03:05:56,059
You're not gonna say this stuff

2998
03:05:56,059 --> 03:06:00,649
when you're hanging by the rope.

2999
03:06:00,649 --> 03:06:02,889
Pull me up, got it, got you.

3000
03:06:02,889 --> 03:06:04,409
Let them all go.

3001
03:06:04,530 --> 03:06:08,010
Now that's just, that's just a sicko thing.

3002
03:06:08,010 --> 03:06:09,930
That's just, you're fucking crazy.

3003
03:06:09,930 --> 03:06:17,829
You're pulling them all up as much as you can.

3004
03:06:17,829 --> 03:06:19,829
Hey, churro captain, thanks for 500 bits.

3005
03:06:19,829 --> 03:06:22,549
Hey, Jerma, are you gonna be using a Nook Miles ticket

3006
03:06:22,549 --> 03:06:25,959
when you move to your new place?

3007
03:06:25,959 --> 03:06:35,860
Yes, yes.

3008
03:06:35,860 --> 03:06:38,219
Let us go, we're nine inches off the ground.

3009
03:06:43,719 --> 03:06:48,799
You're so fucking funny.

3010
03:06:48,799 --> 03:06:52,639
It's so funny when I hear these things.

3011
03:06:53,700 --> 03:06:54,540
I go.

3012
03:06:59,819 --> 03:07:01,500
Let them go, let them all go.

3013
03:07:01,500 --> 03:07:02,979
Let them all go.

3014
03:07:02,979 --> 03:07:13,739
Just let them all go.

3015
03:07:13,739 --> 03:07:15,579
Ah, people are screaming.

3016
03:07:19,040 --> 03:07:19,879
Oh God.

3017
03:07:20,760 --> 03:07:24,659
Screaming at all caps.

3018
03:07:24,659 --> 03:07:27,020
Hey, egg scramble, thanks for the 250.

3019
03:07:27,020 --> 03:07:30,459
Yo, also my 21st birthday on Tuesday.

3020
03:07:30,459 --> 03:07:32,780
I'm gonna spend it alone in quarantine,

3021
03:07:32,780 --> 03:07:34,979
but your VODs are gonna get me through it.

3022
03:07:34,979 --> 03:07:37,379
Can you give me your favorite grocery list

3023
03:07:37,379 --> 03:07:39,180
as an early birthday present?

3024
03:07:39,180 --> 03:07:45,350
Yes, Cliff Bars, a bunch of them.

3025
03:07:45,350 --> 03:07:48,149
Campbell's Soups, a bunch of them.

3026
03:07:48,149 --> 03:07:50,350
Tons of Cliff Bars, make sure, and this is,

3027
03:07:50,350 --> 03:07:51,670
you might be able to,

3028
03:07:51,670 --> 03:07:53,469
oh, here comes another advertisement for a company

3029
03:07:53,469 --> 03:07:55,790
that there's no money involved here.

3030
03:07:56,790 --> 03:07:59,709
Cliff Bars are, they're delicious.

3031
03:07:59,709 --> 03:08:08,120
They're very filling and they'll carry you a long time.

3032
03:08:08,120 --> 03:08:12,319
I got a bunch of them.

3033
03:08:12,319 --> 03:08:15,479
Also, stuff like boxed macaroni and cheese

3034
03:08:15,479 --> 03:08:18,629
is really, really easy to store.

3035
03:08:18,629 --> 03:08:21,149
Soups, canned soups are very easy to store,

3036
03:08:21,149 --> 03:08:23,239
and they're good.

3037
03:08:23,239 --> 03:08:27,780
Tuna fish, tuna fish, it keeps forever,

3038
03:08:27,780 --> 03:08:29,540
and it can be used in a million different places.

3039
03:08:29,540 --> 03:08:32,540
You can eat that shit out of the can.

3040
03:08:32,540 --> 03:08:44,450
There you go, that's my grocery list.

3041
03:08:44,450 --> 03:08:47,020
Don't forget baby food.

3042
03:08:47,020 --> 03:08:49,370
Yeah, you get that too.

3043
03:08:49,370 --> 03:08:50,290
Eight-year-old diet?

3044
03:08:50,290 --> 03:08:51,729
No, I mean, we're talking about,

3045
03:08:54,139 --> 03:08:55,819
we're talking about the quarantine stuff,

3046
03:08:55,819 --> 03:08:57,659
and stuff they can easily,

3047
03:08:57,659 --> 03:09:01,739
guys, I'm not eating tuna fish out of the can every day.

3048
03:09:01,739 --> 03:09:04,819
We're talking about preparing for potentially

3049
03:09:04,819 --> 03:09:11,399
having to be in your house for two or three weeks.

3050
03:09:11,399 --> 03:09:17,370
Non-perishables, that's correct.

3051
03:09:17,370 --> 03:09:19,170
Peanut butter is another good one.

3052
03:09:19,170 --> 03:09:20,809
Rice is another good one.

3053
03:09:20,809 --> 03:09:22,930
Although, rice is kind of hard to find

3054
03:09:22,930 --> 03:09:27,399
during these kinds of people that go into the store

3055
03:09:27,399 --> 03:09:28,719
and they're buying up everything they can.

3056
03:09:28,719 --> 03:09:31,260
Peanut butter is great.

3057
03:09:31,260 --> 03:09:32,579
Beans are great.

3058
03:09:32,579 --> 03:09:35,020
If you like refried beans, just get a bunch of them.

3059
03:09:35,059 --> 03:09:37,299
You can just eat them.

3060
03:09:37,299 --> 03:09:43,100
Do what you can, right?

3061
03:09:43,100 --> 03:09:54,700
I could eat refried beans every day.

3062
03:09:54,700 --> 03:09:59,500
Stop talking about tuna, sorry.

3063
03:09:59,500 --> 03:10:01,180
But I wish you the best of luck.

3064
03:10:01,180 --> 03:10:04,260
Everybody around the world is currently

3065
03:10:04,260 --> 03:10:06,299
at a standstill right now,

3066
03:10:06,299 --> 03:10:08,420
hoping that this shit just goes away

3067
03:10:08,420 --> 03:10:13,319
and we can just kind of hunker down and get through it.

3068
03:10:13,319 --> 03:10:18,149
Let's hope so.

3069
03:10:18,149 --> 03:10:21,389
Hey, TarAlecran2.

3070
03:10:21,389 --> 03:10:24,709
Hey, Jerma, I'm holding the TarAlecran2 username hostage.

3071
03:10:24,709 --> 03:10:27,829
If TarAlecran wants TarAlecran2,

3072
03:10:27,829 --> 03:10:31,000
I need a bean burrito.

3073
03:10:31,000 --> 03:10:31,959
Well, that has nothing to do with me.

3074
03:10:31,959 --> 03:10:34,239
That is between the two of you.

3075
03:10:34,239 --> 03:10:37,000
That is between the two, that is between you two.

3076
03:10:37,000 --> 03:10:41,000
That's between you and TarAlecran2

3077
03:10:41,000 --> 03:10:44,629
and TarAlecran is between you two, the two of you.

3078
03:10:44,629 --> 03:10:46,329
Nothing to do with me.

3079
03:10:46,329 --> 03:10:48,290
Hey, GooBerryJuice, thanks for the 300 bits chat

3080
03:10:48,290 --> 03:11:01,110
whenever someone mentions JoJo.

3081
03:11:01,110 --> 03:11:04,659
No hate, I know everyone has their tastes.

3082
03:11:04,659 --> 03:11:06,700
We don't all have to like the same things

3083
03:11:06,700 --> 03:11:08,379
to love each other.

3084
03:11:08,379 --> 03:11:10,899
Also, there's new hairstyles in AC Mirror,

3085
03:11:10,899 --> 03:11:17,180
one of which looks like yours.

3086
03:11:17,180 --> 03:11:19,620
I just don't even, I have no say in any of this

3087
03:11:19,620 --> 03:11:22,379
because I've never seen the damn show.

3088
03:11:22,379 --> 03:11:26,299
I don't even know what the show is.

3089
03:11:26,299 --> 03:11:32,190
That show could star vegetables and fruits and shit

3090
03:11:32,190 --> 03:11:34,549
and I would be like, okay, that JoJo's Bizarre Adventure,

3091
03:11:34,549 --> 03:11:39,379
JoJo's a banana and he has his band of strawberries

3092
03:11:39,379 --> 03:11:41,940
and fruits and shit and like vegetables.

3093
03:11:41,940 --> 03:11:44,700
I'd be like, okay, that's a weird TV show, I guess.

3094
03:11:44,700 --> 03:11:50,069
I wouldn't even, I don't even know what it would be.

3095
03:11:50,069 --> 03:11:54,319
Seems like it could be, I don't know, I've never seen it.

3096
03:11:54,319 --> 03:11:56,040
Hey, Kirunch, thanks for the 500 bits.

3097
03:11:56,040 --> 03:11:58,000
Hey, LateBits, sorry about that.

3098
03:11:58,000 --> 03:12:00,860
Don't have to say sorry, we're just hanging out.

3099
03:12:00,860 --> 03:12:03,860
I just got confirmed as far as I know for my first job

3100
03:12:03,860 --> 03:12:06,940
and I've been wanting to donate to you for a while.

3101
03:12:06,940 --> 03:12:08,100
Wanted to do it the day I started it,

3102
03:12:08,100 --> 03:12:10,659
but it looks like you'll be off streaming when it happens,

3103
03:12:10,659 --> 03:12:13,500
so I'll send them over what I currently can early.

3104
03:12:13,500 --> 03:12:15,219
I'm a newer viewer.

3105
03:12:15,219 --> 03:12:18,020
I just think you're genuine cool and I wanna help out,

3106
03:12:18,940 --> 03:12:19,780
I wish you the best during your move

3107
03:12:19,780 --> 03:12:21,940
and during our weird pandemic times

3108
03:12:21,940 --> 03:12:26,379
as well as everybody in chat.

3109
03:12:26,379 --> 03:12:31,149
I really appreciate that, but take care of yourself.

3110
03:12:31,149 --> 03:12:32,670
Make sure you're taken care of.

3111
03:12:32,670 --> 03:12:34,350
Make sure you're taking care of your loved ones,

3112
03:12:34,350 --> 03:12:38,440
your friends, your family.

3113
03:12:38,440 --> 03:12:43,459
Take care of you, I hope you do.

3114
03:12:43,459 --> 03:12:47,989
And thanks for checking out the stream when you did.

3115
03:12:47,989 --> 03:12:56,100
Say you're a newer viewer, so I'm not sure how new,

3116
03:12:56,100 --> 03:13:07,139
but thank you and good luck on the new job.

3117
03:13:07,139 --> 03:13:11,430
We had 250 from Pigeon.

3118
03:13:11,430 --> 03:13:12,270
Thanks, Pigeon.

3119
03:13:12,270 --> 03:13:13,870
Hey, Germa, it's your favorite bird.

3120
03:13:13,870 --> 03:13:16,149
It's been a while, but college plus a boyfriend

3121
03:13:16,149 --> 03:13:19,270
has hindered my ability to watch all your streams.

3122
03:13:19,270 --> 03:13:21,229
Though I try to keep up on the archive.

3123
03:13:22,309 --> 03:13:25,350
Cue the you don't have to feel pressure to watch spiel.

3124
03:13:25,350 --> 03:13:26,389
I was gonna do it.

3125
03:13:26,389 --> 03:13:27,670
I was gonna do it.

3126
03:13:27,670 --> 03:13:29,510
You already took the words right out of my mouth.

3127
03:13:29,510 --> 03:13:31,030
But now with all my classes moving online,

3128
03:13:31,030 --> 03:13:33,190
I have a lot of more time.

3129
03:13:33,190 --> 03:13:35,510
Wish I could tell you that you've been super productive.

3130
03:13:35,510 --> 03:13:37,270
Oh, I've been super productive.

3131
03:13:37,270 --> 03:13:40,229
But honestly, I've just been catching up on video games

3132
03:13:40,309 --> 03:13:42,110
and I've been able to watch your streams again.

3133
03:13:42,110 --> 03:13:43,309
It's good to be back.

3134
03:13:43,309 --> 03:13:49,209
Love you.

3135
03:13:49,209 --> 03:13:51,329
You don't have to, yeah, yeah, yada, yada, yada,

3136
03:13:51,329 --> 03:13:53,540
the thing I was just gonna say.

3137
03:13:53,540 --> 03:13:54,659
If you have time and you're around

3138
03:13:54,659 --> 03:14:02,309
and you wanna hang out, then by all means, absolutely.

3139
03:14:02,309 --> 03:14:05,950
But I think we're all kinda catching up on video games

3140
03:14:05,950 --> 03:14:17,170
and sort of stuff to do in your house.

3141
03:14:17,170 --> 03:14:18,129
He hates us.

3142
03:14:18,129 --> 03:14:18,969
What?

3143
03:14:22,680 --> 03:14:27,459
Why did you just write that?

3144
03:14:27,459 --> 03:14:29,700
Doctor says, boyfriend sucks.

3145
03:14:29,700 --> 03:14:31,959
Oh yeah, I forgot about that.

3146
03:14:31,959 --> 03:14:33,829
Thanks a lot, Pigeon.

3147
03:14:33,829 --> 03:14:35,629
Good to see you again.

3148
03:14:35,629 --> 03:14:39,629
Hey, Keith King Crimson from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.

3149
03:14:39,629 --> 03:14:40,469
Thanks for the 250.

3150
03:14:40,469 --> 03:14:41,629
What if you went to Olive Garden

3151
03:14:41,629 --> 03:14:43,229
and ordered endless breadsticks

3152
03:14:43,229 --> 03:14:45,149
but the waiter brought out a single,

3153
03:14:45,149 --> 03:14:47,829
really long breadstick that stretched all the way

3154
03:14:47,829 --> 03:14:49,110
to the back of the kitchen?

3155
03:14:49,110 --> 03:14:51,190
And no matter how much you ate, more breadstick

3156
03:14:51,190 --> 03:14:55,139
just kept coming out of the kitchen with no end in sight.

3157
03:14:55,139 --> 03:14:57,100
Well, I would be a little disgusted

3158
03:14:57,100 --> 03:14:59,500
because how would that not touch other people?

3159
03:15:00,420 --> 03:15:02,059
How would that gigantic breadstick?

3160
03:15:02,059 --> 03:15:03,579
Some people are gonna be stepping over that.

3161
03:15:03,579 --> 03:15:04,540
Somebody might bump into it.

3162
03:15:04,540 --> 03:15:06,620
Somebody might put their shoe on it.

3163
03:15:06,620 --> 03:15:07,500
Somebody's gonna step on it.

3164
03:15:07,500 --> 03:15:08,739
I'm not eating that.

3165
03:15:08,739 --> 03:15:18,719
No, it's gonna be limbo.

3166
03:15:18,719 --> 03:15:20,079
But what if it's in a tube

3167
03:15:20,079 --> 03:15:22,440
and it comes out the end of the tube?

3168
03:15:22,440 --> 03:15:26,639
I would ask very, very, I'd eat some of it.

3169
03:15:26,639 --> 03:15:31,370
And after about two or three loaves of bread worth of bread,

3170
03:15:31,370 --> 03:15:34,379
I'd say, who's the guy that spent 40 grand

3171
03:15:34,379 --> 03:15:39,780
to make this a reality and why is it only on my table?

3172
03:15:39,780 --> 03:15:42,379
I see over there, that couple over there

3173
03:15:42,379 --> 03:15:44,479
has regular breadsticks.

3174
03:15:45,440 --> 03:15:46,840
And that group of friends over there

3175
03:15:46,840 --> 03:15:48,360
has regular soups and shit.

3176
03:15:48,360 --> 03:15:50,950
Why are you doing this to me?

3177
03:15:50,950 --> 03:15:53,469
And then you hear just a wheeze laugh

3178
03:15:53,469 --> 03:16:02,409
deep within the kitchen, just like a fucking wheeze laugh.

3179
03:16:02,889 --> 03:16:04,610
I was gonna do the wheeze laugh.

3180
03:16:04,610 --> 03:16:07,729
I was gonna smash it out, but I didn't

3181
03:16:07,729 --> 03:16:13,549
because I didn't wanna exert my chest cavity.

3182
03:16:13,549 --> 03:16:16,020
Pretend I did.

3183
03:16:16,020 --> 03:16:19,010
Hey, let's run those credits.

3184
03:16:19,010 --> 03:16:21,129
And again, I will see you guys.

3185
03:16:21,129 --> 03:16:26,139
Garin, Teed, Saturday, Garin Teed.

3186
03:16:26,139 --> 03:16:32,659
If there is no stream on Saturday, then I have hell to pay.

3187
03:16:32,659 --> 03:16:38,159
Saturday afternoon, I will be live at Garin fucking Teed.

3188
03:16:38,280 --> 03:16:39,120
I gotta stop swearing.

3189
03:16:39,120 --> 03:16:41,159
You know, my mother told me to stop swearing.

3190
03:16:41,159 --> 03:16:42,860
I tell you that.

3191
03:16:42,860 --> 03:16:44,799
My mother caught one of my streams recently.

3192
03:16:44,799 --> 03:16:46,180
She's like, oh, that was like really interesting

3193
03:16:46,180 --> 03:16:47,020
and really fun.

3194
03:16:47,020 --> 03:16:48,739
Can you stop, you gotta stop swearing.

3195
03:16:48,739 --> 03:16:53,340
And I was like, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma.

3196
03:16:53,340 --> 03:16:54,780
She's like, no, I want you to stop swearing.

3197
03:16:54,780 --> 03:16:59,840
And I'm like, ma.

3198
03:16:59,840 --> 03:17:05,079
So as of Saturday, I'm gonna say 25% less swear words.

3199
03:17:06,950 --> 03:17:09,020
We're gonna clean it up a little bit.

3200
03:17:09,020 --> 03:17:13,020
So instead of fuck, it's gonna be shoot.

3201
03:17:13,020 --> 03:17:15,940
And instead of shit, it's gonna be crap.

3202
03:17:15,940 --> 03:17:24,420
And instead of booger, it's gonna be snot.

3203
03:17:24,420 --> 03:17:25,979
I don't know.

3204
03:17:25,979 --> 03:17:27,819
Shoot.

3205
03:17:27,899 --> 03:17:29,139
Crap is just as bad.

3206
03:17:29,139 --> 03:17:29,979
No, it's not.

3207
03:17:29,979 --> 03:17:32,030
I'm kidding.

3208
03:17:32,030 --> 03:17:34,430
My mother said three swears telling me in the sentence

3209
03:17:34,430 --> 03:17:37,790
to tell me to stop swearing, to stop swearing.

3210
03:17:37,790 --> 03:17:39,940
And she swore like four times.

3211
03:17:39,940 --> 03:17:44,600
We're a swearing family.

3212
03:17:44,600 --> 03:17:47,309
Anyways, here come the credits.

3213
03:17:47,309 --> 03:17:49,840
They should be showing up on your screen now

3214
03:17:49,840 --> 03:17:52,840
in about 10 seconds or so.

3215
03:17:52,840 --> 03:17:54,709
Here they come.

3216
03:17:54,709 --> 03:17:55,590
Thanks everybody for your subs.

3217
03:17:55,590 --> 03:17:58,190
All of the new subs, all tubs, all the ongoing subs,

3218
03:17:58,190 --> 03:18:01,110
all the subs that maybe you subbed like 12 months ago

3219
03:18:01,110 --> 03:18:02,030
and you never did.

3220
03:18:02,030 --> 03:18:03,629
Maybe you got a community sub from somebody.

3221
03:18:03,670 --> 03:18:06,799
Maybe you subbed like four years ago or whatever.

3222
03:18:06,799 --> 03:18:08,360
Thanks for even considering.

3223
03:18:08,360 --> 03:18:09,559
Appreciate it.

3224
03:18:09,559 --> 03:18:11,659
All of you.

3225
03:18:11,659 --> 03:18:13,700
We're gonna finish up the bits.

3226
03:18:13,700 --> 03:18:17,139
We have a couple more to do.

3227
03:18:17,139 --> 03:18:20,379
We have Cosmocrat for the 300 bits here, three bucks.

3228
03:18:20,379 --> 03:18:22,219
Hey, Jerma, awesome stream as always.

3229
03:18:22,219 --> 03:18:23,540
You should play Hearthstone on Saturday.

3230
03:18:23,540 --> 03:18:24,459
Not gonna happen.

3231
03:18:24,459 --> 03:18:25,459
We'll buy you packs.

3232
03:18:25,459 --> 03:18:26,379
Not gonna happen.

3233
03:18:26,379 --> 03:18:28,659
Also really stupid, outdated question.

3234
03:18:28,659 --> 03:18:31,299
When you fake proposed to Kim on your moving to Vegas stream,

3235
03:18:31,299 --> 03:18:32,120
was she in on it?

3236
03:18:32,120 --> 03:18:33,840
Yes.

3237
03:18:33,840 --> 03:18:34,819
I would not do that to somebody.

3238
03:18:34,819 --> 03:18:39,020
That's so fucking horrible.

3239
03:18:39,020 --> 03:18:39,860
Play Smite.

3240
03:18:40,620 --> 03:18:43,579
Is this like a, are you guys plants?

3241
03:18:43,579 --> 03:18:47,530
Are you guys plants?

3242
03:18:47,530 --> 03:18:54,209
What's with the plants here about like play Smite?

3243
03:18:54,209 --> 03:18:55,170
It's working.

3244
03:18:55,170 --> 03:18:57,649
Just wanna let you know, your scheme is working.

3245
03:18:57,649 --> 03:19:00,360
You've got me thinking about it again.

3246
03:19:00,360 --> 03:19:02,959
What I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna go lie down in my bed

3247
03:19:02,959 --> 03:19:05,319
with my iPad and just look at all the stats

3248
03:19:05,319 --> 03:19:06,680
for all the gods that have released

3249
03:19:06,680 --> 03:19:09,809
in two and a half, three years.

3250
03:19:09,809 --> 03:19:14,420
It's working.

3251
03:19:14,420 --> 03:19:19,069
Hey, FrozenThor516, thanks for the 250.

3252
03:19:19,069 --> 03:19:20,709
Hey, Jerma, today when I was watching this stream,

3253
03:19:20,709 --> 03:19:23,989
my country New Zealand went into level three lockdown

3254
03:19:23,989 --> 03:19:25,790
and going to level four lockdown

3255
03:19:25,790 --> 03:19:28,340
at 48 hours because of the virus.

3256
03:19:28,340 --> 03:19:30,229
I'll be at home for a month.

3257
03:19:30,229 --> 03:19:32,950
Luckily, on the plus side, I'll be able to tune

3258
03:19:32,950 --> 03:19:36,479
into all your live streams for one month.

3259
03:19:36,479 --> 03:19:39,340
Stay safe out there, Jerma, and you chat.

3260
03:19:39,340 --> 03:19:40,159
Lots of love to all of you.

3261
03:19:40,159 --> 03:19:43,620
Also side note, no game you ever played has ever bored me.

3262
03:19:43,620 --> 03:19:48,180
I dare you to find a game I will hate you playing.

3263
03:19:48,180 --> 03:19:52,840
Please step right this way to Mountain Blade

3264
03:19:52,840 --> 03:19:58,860
or Europa Universe sales or Crusader Kings.

3265
03:19:58,860 --> 03:20:00,059
No one will want me to play those games.

3266
03:20:00,059 --> 03:20:01,799
I don't know you guys say those things.

3267
03:20:01,799 --> 03:20:06,040
If I play Crusader Kings, I will actually lose fans.

3268
03:20:06,040 --> 03:20:08,799
People that are like fans of this channel

3269
03:20:08,799 --> 03:20:13,620
will flip 180 degrees if I play Crusader Kings

3270
03:20:13,620 --> 03:20:15,200
for more than four or five hours.

3271
03:20:15,200 --> 03:20:18,129
I'm just telling you facts.

3272
03:20:18,129 --> 03:20:20,409
I would be so unbearable.

3273
03:20:20,409 --> 03:20:22,940
I would be so unbearable.

3274
03:20:24,139 --> 03:20:29,450
People would be, I couldn't even, you know.

3275
03:20:34,120 --> 03:20:41,049
See you guys on Saturday.

3276
03:20:41,049 --> 03:20:43,649
An anonymous cheer right at the very end, $10.

3277
03:20:43,649 --> 03:20:48,940
No message, just an anonymous amount of money.

3278
03:20:48,940 --> 03:20:51,729
Take care of yourselves.

3279
03:20:51,729 --> 03:20:54,329
Enjoy this week coming up here.

3280
03:20:54,329 --> 03:20:59,540
I will be back on Saturday at the latest.

3281
03:20:59,540 --> 03:21:03,100
I have to reiterate this one more time.

3282
03:21:03,100 --> 03:21:06,319
The latest you will see me is Saturday afternoon.

3283
03:21:06,319 --> 03:21:10,639
And that is a 100% guarantee this should not take very long.

3284
03:21:10,639 --> 03:21:11,600
Take care.

3285
03:21:11,600 --> 03:21:12,479
Much love to you.

3286
03:21:12,479 --> 03:21:16,479
Stay safe.

3287
03:21:16,479 --> 03:21:19,229
See you soon.

3288
03:21:19,229 --> 03:21:58,620
Take care.

3289
03:21:58,620 --> 03:21:59,819
Missed bits.

3290
03:21:59,819 --> 03:22:00,659
I did?

3291
03:22:00,659 --> 03:22:03,340
No, I didn't.

3292
03:22:03,340 --> 03:22:05,469
Are you guys gonna raid Joel?

3293
03:22:05,469 --> 03:22:09,530
How's he doing?

3294
03:22:09,530 --> 03:22:10,370
Joel, what?

3295
03:22:10,370 --> 03:22:12,819
Raid Joel.

3296
03:22:12,819 --> 03:22:17,180
Playing Super Mario World?

3297
03:22:17,180 --> 03:22:19,940
All right, let's go diarrhea over on Joel's channel.

3298
03:22:19,940 --> 03:22:21,139
See you guys next week.
