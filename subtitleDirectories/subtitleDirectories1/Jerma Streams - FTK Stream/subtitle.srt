1
00:00:02,549 --> 00:00:09,029
Hello! We're an hour and 10 minutes late, but who cares?

2
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:18,410
Oh, good, good, good, good, good. Hi, how are you? I am as exa- get these people away from me,

3
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:26,890
by the way. If you're within like a 10 second radius of the king. Uh, we had a little bit of-

4
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:30,250
we have some problems. Uh, we're trying to get through. There are currently, I think,

5
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:36,009
two or three hundred people on the server right now. Welcome to FTK, the first alpha test of FTK.

6
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:45,020
10 second radius. Uh, I'm Jerma, how are you? Good to see you. We've been, uh, debugging, uh,

7
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:52,619
back and forth, but the kingdom is currently, uh, full with people at the moment. Uh, some of which

8
00:00:52,619 --> 00:01:03,850
I don't know where they are. Early access, early access. Yes, yes, very much so. This is the first

9
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:10,019
he killed three people. I didn't kill anybody, okay? Debugging a server! Well, I haven't, but

10
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:15,379
there's been some devs. Uh, you're pro- if you're in the game right now, uh, very- a couple of very

11
00:01:15,379 --> 00:01:18,500
important things. I actually need to- I need to tweet this. I don't even know enough. I don't-

12
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:26,760
where the fuck is my phone? I have no idea where my phone is. Way more people were interested in

13
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:35,290
this than I thought were. There is no whitelist. We had to can that last second because, uh,

14
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:42,680
there was a lot of API problems that we had to work around, but no shit, Sherlock. I- look,

15
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:50,150
I know. I know. I- I know. It's a new video game. I- I- look, I'm out in a- I'm outside right now,

16
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:56,519
and I- there's a- I got a fucking paddle, and I'm in a boat, and we're just rowing. We're just rowing

17
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:08,039
in the water. No one's ever done anything like this before. We're charting new territory. Show us? Uh,

18
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:17,400
we can show you right now. It's an eight-year-old game. Little did German985 think that, uh,

19
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,680
5,000 people all trying to connect to the same server at the same time, even with, like, three

20
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:30,020
servers and a bunch of shit in place. I mean, he's just a fucking idiot. That's all you need to know.

21
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:35,900
Anyways, uh, I'm surprised no one's tried to attack me as the king, but if you can see the

22
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:44,979
screen here, I'm not sure if we can see anything. Uh, this is the kingdom. Uh, welcome, everybody.

23
00:02:44,979 --> 00:02:50,389
There are currently fucking hundreds of people in here, and you know how this game works.

24
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:57,639
So if anyone gets too close- I'm going to my throne room. I- I'm like, guards, stay with me.

25
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:11,590
If anybody tries anything, just get rid of them. Push them off. This is my bedroom,

26
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,870
if you wanted to see. There's a ton of people in my- I don't feel safe right now.

27
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:25,719
Oh, and there's the music. Welcome, everybody, to Fuck the King. Oh, it's because they're all

28
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:33,379
children. Right, okay, I get it. Somebody just punched me. Somebody just punched me.

29
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:41,639
I don't know who it was. All right, I'm gonna go down to my throne. The server actually is stable.

30
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:46,650
You gotta be kidding me. I'm so happy right now. The server's stable. We were getting fucking

31
00:03:46,650 --> 00:04:04,840
screwed. If you are under the- if you are under the age of five, you can't mine. So that's why-

32
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:16,500
get away from me. I'm gonna punch this person. Wait, are you a mod? All right, this is the dining

33
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:26,839
room. You can't mine until you're five years old. I can't believe- why is nobody trying to kill me?

34
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:31,560
This is the throne. All right, if you're on the throne, you just killed that person. Okay,

35
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:50,220
that person's dead. Hey! Don't let any- anybody on the throne. Somebody got killed.

36
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:58,100
Ladies and gentlemen, please, welcome to the kingdom, all of you. What did you throw to me?

37
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:09,620
The king needs to eat. Get the fuck out of here. Go exist in the kingdom. Why are you all standing

38
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:19,689
here? Why are there a hundred of you standing in front of the throne? Get out of my castle.

39
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:33,879
Okay, all right. If the throne room has anyone in it in the next 15 seconds, you will die. One,

40
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:54,569
two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen.

41
00:05:55,129 --> 00:06:06,389
You just made it out. Go exist! My gods will protect me from all this bullshit. All this food

42
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:17,899
is delicious. You know there's an entire kingdom. In fact, it's so good to see you. I may, in fact,

43
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:30,899
have a song that I would like to sing. It's so good to see everyone. You're all so wonderful.

44
00:06:31,779 --> 00:06:47,029
This is the first stream of the kingdom. I think I have a song coming on. What a little town. What

45
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:59,500
a quiet little village. Every day, like the day before, absolutely beautiful. There's so many

46
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:15,879
people here. What a quiet village, castle, and all of its participants. A hundred of them.

47
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:27,529
I just have one thing to say to you. Bonjour. Bonjour. Bonjour. There goes the baker with his tray

48
00:07:27,529 --> 00:07:36,170
like always. Don't hit me! Every day it's just the same. In the kingdom, just the same. All right,

49
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:44,730
kill them! Kill them! Kill them! They're attacking! Kill them! Stop! I'm going back to my castle.

50
00:07:48,009 --> 00:08:08,540
Brent! Kill them! Kill everyone! I shouldn't have attacked them. To the castle, because we just

51
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:15,990
deleted like 30 people. By the way, this is the first of the tests of the FDK show.

52
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:28,379
There's no way I'm gonna die. I'm not gonna die. I need to get back to my castle.

53
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:38,679
I think those are all babies. How old were they? Somebody just wrote, what am I supposed to do?

54
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:43,830
Kill this guy! No, don't, don't, don't, don't!

55
00:08:43,830 --> 00:09:10,340
Every day, like always, we check the garden and the stall. Every morning, just the same. Me and my guards, we have to take all the crazy people that will try to jump at the server at the same time and 5,000 connections crash the server. Get them away from me!

56
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:25,690
Okay, let's delete the music from Beauty and the Beast, or we will get the vomit claimed in less than

57
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:36,470
five minutes. So we should probably get rid of it. Because the vicar, the vomit is going to be de-fucking-lated

58
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:43,990
if you do not kill this music. What a beautiful garden! What a wonderful garden! I couldn't think

59
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:49,590
of anything other than a random gardener. Thank you for your participation. Thank you everyone for joining the server!

60
00:09:50,549 --> 00:10:04,220
Where's the castle? My trusted guards, let's go over them one by one. Cad, the video game developer.

61
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:18,740
Barretti, destroyer. Freshpink Flakes, the cereal worker. Are you a guard? I don't know. Supressor,

62
00:10:19,299 --> 00:10:27,129
the soup-based guard. He doesn't know his own kingdom. We must find, you have to eat food or you

63
00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:31,129
can't participate. The king needs to get back to his castle, but one of the guards, please show him

64
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:36,779
how to get back to the castle. And by the way, there is no whitelist on this server. You are

65
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:45,860
going to be nearly landed because this fucking API was fucked. My kingdom, I'm currently in the

66
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:54,980
Outer Lands right now. TP me to the castle. The king requires a TP to the castle because he's stupid

67
00:10:54,980 --> 00:11:04,919
and doesn't know where his own shit is. TP me to the castle, I don't know where it is. The king can

68
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:20,820
cheat if he wants to. Can I just say, oh, and there's the throne room. My beautiful throne,

69
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:29,799
nice fail RP. Somebody said in the chat room, well that person can fuck off. Currently in my

70
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:37,980
throne room, the king will exist here. Until then, someone just punched me. Get that person out of

71
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:50,940
here. I don't want them in my kingdom, I don't want them near my throne. Currently 31 years old. And

72
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:55,750
if we could start to, I know at least 30 people died right there. If we could bring some more

73
00:11:55,750 --> 00:12:04,620
people into the server, it would be fantastic. It's been one year and the harvest has been

74
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:31,850
completely fruitful. Why is this happening? Fuck. I would like to address the crowd if I may.

75
00:12:32,409 --> 00:12:43,779
I'm going to go up to my balcony. Whoops, that's a wall. Remember there are up to two, three, four

76
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:50,120
hundred people in the server at the same time. In my kingdom, in my journey, there's nothing in this

77
00:12:50,120 --> 00:13:09,899
chest. I'm going to go visit. I see only about 10 people in the courtyard. The king has been drinking

78
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:16,200
for the last hour and a half and the king was not sure this server was going to turn on. So he's a

79
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:25,269
little tipsy at the moment if we could just be very frank. My subjects, some of you which are not even

80
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:40,330
present at the moment, how have none of you started to eat? Here, take a few chickens on me, your king.

81
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:49,049
In fact, have a few mutton too. I'm a good king. You don't want to get rid of me. I'm a good king.

82
00:13:49,049 --> 00:13:59,159
How many people are here right now? Where are all of my subjects in the kingdom of Germalonia?

83
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:04,120
Yes, that's correct. That's the name of this whole thing. I just came up with that right now,

84
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:14,019
Germalonia. Are you dying of starvation yet? I somehow have de-aged. I have gone back a year.

85
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:26,570
I was 31 and now I'm 30. My loyal subjects, if you could please do something for your very,

86
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:37,799
very, very noble king. I require a gold block statue of my likeness in the middle of the

87
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:48,940
outland courtyard within the next 30 minutes or I will execute 50 people. I want a gold dick

88
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:56,629
that's representative of my life. I will show you. Wait, I don't want to fall off the edge

89
00:14:56,629 --> 00:15:10,470
because I deleted it. Take this. I said that in the very noble war. Would anyone like a piece

90
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:21,509
of bread? By the way, my loyal servants, my loyal guard, if anyone comes up these stairs,

91
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:31,320
kill them instantly. I want a gold statue of me and I'll show you where it is. I'll show you where

92
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:37,860
I want it. Guards, come with me. Set the castle on fire. Set the castle on fire. Good luck.

93
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:54,009
I'm getting lost in my own castle. Who is this person and why are they in here? Oh,

94
00:15:54,009 --> 00:16:00,710
bread for the king. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. You're doing a very good thing.

95
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:10,139
Thank you for the bread. Let me show you. Follow me. I'll show you. Somebody just punched me.

96
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:15,350
Who just punched me? I'd like to know who it was. Oh, I'm going a little too far in

97
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:25,980
the common people. This bread is just no good. Here, someone else eat this.

98
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:37,379
How did you make 64 bread? That was impossible. Don't let them in. Don't let them in. Get these

99
00:16:37,379 --> 00:17:07,269
bitches. I'll shower you with love. Follow me. Get away from me. Shit. Get away from everybody.

100
00:17:07,269 --> 00:17:17,559
I don't have any guards. This is a mistake. Where are my guards? I would like the gold statue.

101
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:26,119
By the way, I'm not kidding. If there's not a gold block statue right here, right here,

102
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:32,819
where I'm standing in 30 minutes from right now, I will execute 50 people. Good luck. Start the timer

103
00:17:32,819 --> 00:18:10,680
now. We can't mine. If you're outside of the red border, you can do whatever you want. Inside of

104
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:16,339
the red border is where you cannot do anything. You can do whatever you want outside as long as

105
00:18:16,339 --> 00:18:24,390
you were five years old. Okay. Good luck. How is this already done? Where did you get the gold

106
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:31,700
blocks? Is this person cheating? How did they get gold? No, there's no way they have that many gold

107
00:18:31,859 --> 00:19:10,220
blocks. Kill them. How many people? There's a lot of people in here. So what was the explosion?

108
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:20,890
I heard a fucking explosion. Who has creative mode? That shouldn't be a thing.

109
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:44,779
Okay. There's like 300 people here. What the fuck are they? I'm actually getting kind of nervous.

110
00:19:46,380 --> 00:20:04,099
Oh my God. Okay. Somebody just punched me. Somebody punched me. I'm going to go into my town.

111
00:20:04,099 --> 00:20:09,240
You can do whatever the hell you want out here. I don't matter. Oh, is that genome? Oh, genome.

112
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:35,900
What age am I? I'm 31. What age are you? I'm two, six, seven, two. I'm two. Yeah, maybe eventually

113
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:50,059
some of you plebs, because that's what you actually are. I'm going to go enjoy my fountain.

114
00:20:50,140 --> 00:21:05,619
Don't let anybody in here. If you come inside, you are dead. Do not let anyone inside. I have

115
00:21:05,619 --> 00:21:21,690
things to do, like exist in my throne room. What happened to the throne room? Why is it my throne

116
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:47,799
room floods? I want you to find who did this and I want you to kill someone. Don't let anyone in the

117
00:21:47,799 --> 00:22:11,990
front gates, no matter what. I'm age seven, yet I still have mining fatigue too. I think, you know

118
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:22,519
what I'd like to do? Is this Colgate Island? What? I'd like for me and my loyal subjects,

119
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:43,059
let's go explore the town a little. What's the matter? What are you all doing out here?

120
00:22:43,059 --> 00:22:52,009
Don't you have things to do? You need food. You need food. Join voice chat. Why? What does that

121
00:22:52,009 --> 00:23:37,190
mean? Join voice chat. Oh, I just went into the voice chat screaming. I live in the castle. No,

122
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:52,220
you don't. Somebody said they killed a Fortnite guy. Excuse me. Thank you for that ladder.

123
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:58,519
Please food. Go get food. Fine. Listen, this is the only time you're going to get a handout like

124
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:19,210
this. Fight for it. Go get it. Don't let them in. Get rid of them. Get rid of them. How dare you?

125
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:24,259
I'm starving. Well, then make some food. I can't be the one that provides everything.

126
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:41,299
I didn't anticipate. Somebody came in the server and said, what is this?

127
00:24:44,150 --> 00:25:03,960
You're going to fucking die. Not going to make it. Are there no animals? There should be.

128
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:33,450
Someone give me the coordinates of the town. I'm lost. There is no food. God, this is fucking so

129
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:42,250
stupid. This is no way no one's going to kill me. I am never going to die. No, there's not a chance

130
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:58,970
in hell. Even if three, four, 500 of you work together. No way. The guards are too strong.

131
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:08,700
My king, I would like to offer my jester services. Okay. Psychostatic. You are dressed like a jester.

132
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:24,279
Let's get you in here. That'll be fun. Psychostatic is allowed inside the king. Yes. Very, very, very

133
00:26:24,279 --> 00:27:00,759
funny. Absolutely hilarious. Now kill him. Why is he still here? I gave a specific order to my

134
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:51,900
subordinates. Just pick it up, man. Just pick it up. Okay. I need to. Oh, ow. Hey, let's take a look

135
00:27:51,900 --> 00:28:21,480
outside. Get out of my way. Go. Food. All right. Let's go this way. Follow me. I would like to go

136
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,960
fishing, please. If I could get a fishing rod. Watch these people behind me. They look like they

137
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:39,559
could be degenerates. What's a command? Excuse me. I'd like to go fishing in my pond. That would be

138
00:28:39,559 --> 00:29:32,819
nice, please. Yeah, go get it. Fuck this warden. I need a fishing rod. No. Everyone thought I was

139
00:29:32,819 --> 00:29:48,329
going to die in five minutes. Do I have a fishing rod yet? Wait, the guards are in creative mode?

140
00:29:48,970 --> 00:30:08,490
Get these guards out of creative mode. Excuse me. I'm trying to fish at my pond, please.

141
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:35,859
If you don't back off in five seconds. Wait, what? Kill that person. Help me. Help the king.

142
00:30:35,859 --> 00:31:33,029
God damn it. Protect me. Protect me at all cost. Are you still alive? We're still live, right? Oh,

143
00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:47,980
my God. What a shit show. What happened? I don't even know what happened. How did I die?

144
00:31:50,390 --> 00:32:02,700
I want to see that. Am I through the stream right now? We have two different calls going. What

145
00:32:02,700 --> 00:33:39,529
happened? Sword killed me. Stone fucking sword killed me. No way. What? I had diamond armor on.

146
00:33:39,529 --> 00:34:06,390
Doesn't make any sense. No, I didn't. I was naked. What do you mean? I was naked? Who killed me?

147
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:17,530
I got hit three times. What? I didn't have any armor. I get another life. Let's go. You're not

148
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:36,710
stopping. Wait, why did I die? Who has a clip? I want to see it. I had like five people with

149
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:44,599
diamond armor on me. Where is it? Let me see it. We're going again. We're going again. New people.

150
00:34:44,599 --> 00:35:27,349
I can't fucking believe I died. Nobody even did anything. I went fishing and got killed.

151
00:35:27,349 --> 00:35:40,019
I didn't have a single piece of armor on. That's not supposed to be real. It's so bad. I thought

152
00:35:40,019 --> 00:36:00,099
I had armor on. He doesn't know how to play Minecraft. Yes, I do. I thought I had armor on.

153
00:36:00,099 --> 00:36:10,039
God damn it. We're going to do a new game. We're going to do a new game. What does a command block

154
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:37,019
do? I don't know what that does. This is fucking funny. Somebody said, bro, please let me in.

155
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:48,500
Somebody set fire to a tree. Can we like deal with this? There's a fucking forest fire. There's a

156
00:36:48,500 --> 00:38:09,079
legit full forest fire right now. All right. Give me one second. I'm in there now. Bro, please let

157
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:16,389
me in, bro. I'm just so happy it works. There was a really high chance that this was not even going

158
00:38:16,389 --> 00:38:34,010
to work. We had a lot of hoops that we had to jump before this could turn on. Fucking hilarious.

159
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:39,130
I don't have any armor. I will have armor next time. You better guarantee it. I get two lives.

160
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:55,960
I love it when a plant falls apart. Well, this is like the alpha. Okay, now I got gear. Okay,

161
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:03,130
now I'm good. Now I do. All right. I didn't have armor last time. Someone's already trying to kill

162
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:14,940
me. What? 34, by the way. What's that mean? 34. Why is it 34? I don't get it. Oh, I was 34 when

163
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:27,210
I died. Oh, I get it. Okay. All right. The floodgates are going to open here soon. Remember,

164
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:34,219
there is no whitelisting right now on this server. This time I'm not dying. I'm not going to go,

165
00:39:34,219 --> 00:39:38,949
go out and like be with the people. No, no, no. Yeah. Fuck that. I'm staying in my castle. Good

166
00:39:38,949 --> 00:39:57,530
luck. I think we're ready. Yeah. I think once we get everybody in, we see some reopen people and

167
00:39:57,530 --> 00:40:05,780
we're good. I'm going to be my throne. I'm going to say this is where I belong. I'm going to say

168
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:18,300
the cameraman's a furry. I'm on a webcam mic. No, I'm not. I'm not on a webcam.

169
00:40:28,099 --> 00:40:39,320
Can we just take a look at the castle before we bring everybody in? Oh, look at how fucking cool

170
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:53,210
this place is. Fix my mic. What's wrong with my mic? Oh, and make sure all the mods are not in

171
00:40:53,210 --> 00:41:02,420
creative. What do you mean Trump? What are you talking about? Why is everybody saying that?

172
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:13,260
Mr. Trump, I don't understand. Why is everybody saying Trump? I don't get it. Somebody said you

173
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:32,380
stop. Oh, well, I'm sorry. Didn't mean to. My mic sucks. The assassin is back. All right.

174
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:38,409
Well, let's go. Round two. This time I'm not dying. I'll stream for 10 hours. I don't care.

175
00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:59,030
I'm not dying. Good luck, baby. I'm not leaving the seat. Hey, give me a diamond sword too, please.

176
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:11,300
There we go. Watch the back of the castle while you're at it. The mic is fucked. What's wrong?

177
00:42:11,300 --> 00:43:00,840
What's wrong with the mic? My mic is fucked. It shouldn't be. Jeremy's paranoid. Well, I have to

178
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:07,030
be. There's like hundreds of people trying to kill me. How many people are in the server right now?

179
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:17,190
Like 300? My mic is fine. So what the fuck? Why would you do that to me? Why would you tell me

180
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:33,139
that? It's literally not. It's actually not. What? Zero people in the server? That's not true.

181
00:43:33,139 --> 00:43:42,550
There's like fucking 300. Discord's fucking it up though. Get more RAM. I got like 120 gigs of RAM.

182
00:43:43,429 --> 00:43:46,789
Who is this person? Oh, that's you. Oh, that's like, okay, you just don't have a skin.

183
00:43:53,719 --> 00:43:57,159
All right. Are we good to go? How many people we got in the server right now?

184
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:03,820
This is the real game. That was the test game. This is the real one. This is the actual game.

185
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:23,769
You ready? What do we, what do we got in the server? How many people? I see the most important

186
00:44:23,769 --> 00:44:28,809
player is JermaFeet. I mean, that's the number one. Just kill that person. Find them and kill them.

187
00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:39,510
Yeah. Just whoever that person is, just find them and kill them. I don't want them in the server.

188
00:44:39,510 --> 00:45:00,599
Oh, I just got kicked. Fuck. Remember when people were going to make towns and stuff and go outside

189
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:09,190
the city limits and make houses and shit? No, it was just, we're just going to follow them around

190
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:20,539
till we have an opportunity for me to kill them with a stone sword. Just follow them around till

191
00:45:20,539 --> 00:45:33,539
we have an opportunity to kill them with an iron sword. That was iron. Okay. All right. Server's

192
00:45:33,539 --> 00:45:52,869
open. Back up again. We're going to try round two. It's hard when you get kicked. I'm just so happy

193
00:45:52,869 --> 00:46:00,940
we actually could get this to run. Why is one of the guards on fire? You die at age 100 if you do

194
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:16,920
not die on the server. Who punched me? All right. Are we good? Are we good to start? Are we good to go?

195
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:28,460
All right. Every morning, just the same. Every morning, just the same. You want to do that again?

196
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:56,309
Start it on. Put it on. Oh, what a glorious day. What a beautiful morning. Oh, what a quiet little

197
00:46:56,309 --> 00:47:17,130
town we're in. My town. My beautiful town. Oh, please. Bonjour. Bonjour. I can't hear the music

198
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:31,559
anymore. Bonjour. Bonjour. There goes the baker with his tray of bakeries. Save a bread and rolls to

199
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:38,199
sell. Every morning, just the same. Every morning, just the same. Since the morning that we came into

200
00:47:38,199 --> 00:47:55,320
this house. Oh, hello. Hello there. Yes. How are you? No, no, no. I'm not going out. I'm not going out.

201
00:47:55,320 --> 00:48:01,239
Someone's back in the throne. Someone's hiding. This will be in the hill right here. I'll show you.

202
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:06,679
Oh, you think you... Oh, where you going? You... Oh, hi there. You thought you were going to be able

203
00:48:06,679 --> 00:48:36,969
to get behind the king? Don't let him. Take my what? Look, you guys have to go mine. Do you see

204
00:48:36,969 --> 00:48:43,699
what I'm wearing right now? I have full diamond armor. You're not going to get in here. In fact,

205
00:48:43,699 --> 00:48:53,989
if you step one more foot forward, you're dead. Don't get stuck. Excuse me. You're getting too close.

206
00:48:54,789 --> 00:49:09,300
You're getting John. John. John. Every morning, just the same. Since the morning that we came

207
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:28,710
to kill the guy Chad striding into my view. How do I wall run? You can't. We got all diamond armor.

208
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:43,269
Go be a citizen for God's sake. I want to go on an adventure. Let's go. Get these people away from

209
00:49:43,909 --> 00:49:58,300
me. I would like a mine to be built down here. Do we have any pickaxes that I would like you to

210
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:09,349
do it for me? Go down. Dig down here. Turn off the music. I'm going crazy. Get this person away from

211
00:50:09,349 --> 00:50:35,239
me. Somebody naked? Thank you. I want to go find diamond blocks. I'd like to do it before anybody

212
00:50:35,239 --> 00:51:03,059
else. Look at the people looking in here. Look at this person dropping sand on here. Okay. Oh,

213
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:09,659
that hurts. That hurts. Somebody's fucking doing great. They're throwing shit at us.

214
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:20,440
This is bad. I want to get out. I want out of here. I want out. This is bad. Do I even have an axe?

215
00:51:21,159 --> 00:51:46,980
I don't have a pickaxe. I don't have a pickaxe. Let's go. Long live the king. That's right.

216
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:56,840
Don't dig straight down my brethren. Somebody died from falling. I just saw it in the chat.

217
00:51:57,639 --> 00:52:10,230
I ain't going that way. You guys, I'm not going to get killed by a creeper. Somebody else go.

218
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:29,530
Vec, you go first. I'm not doing it. Do we have any torches? I need to eat. King Jerma, I come from

219
00:52:29,530 --> 00:52:34,010
a faraway land to offer some of my wrestling talent to you. You come nearer, you're dead.

220
00:52:34,809 --> 00:52:49,369
Don't even come within 10 feet of me. Okay. At this point now, at this point in the game,

221
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:57,289
guards, if anyone comes within five feet of me, kill them. Do not let them survive.

222
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:03,639
We cannot have an opportunity when somebody comes in with a diamond axe and kills them.

223
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:19,030
What's five feet? I'll show you. This is five feet. 1.5 blocks. The king requires gold.

224
00:53:25,849 --> 00:53:34,949
Can we open the server back up again for more people to come in? Somebody said iPhone Mike.

225
00:53:35,429 --> 00:53:40,389
I don't even know what you're talking about. iPhone Mike. Shit Mike.

226
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:54,869
People aren't getting kicked when they die. Yeah. We got a lot of systems we're trying to fix.

227
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:11,590
It's a Game Boy Mike. Why did I get hurt? Why are you on fire? You all right?

228
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:33,179
It's a webcam Mike. It's not a webcam Mike. I hear a growling. How many people have gotten

229
00:54:33,179 --> 00:54:55,079
the server now? Let's load another 100 people in. Nobody can join. You're only playing with guards.

230
00:54:55,079 --> 00:55:06,739
That's not true. This is sick. There's like 10 guards. I see iron. I'm not going to mind.

231
00:55:06,739 --> 00:55:25,820
It's somebody else's mind for me. 150 now. You need food? No, get your own food. Watch that exit

232
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:40,619
here. No, you know what? Watch the water. Watch the water. Watch the water. Guards, get out of

233
00:55:40,619 --> 00:55:46,539
here. This is stupid for us to be doing. I would like 50 citizens to dig up this rest of this cave

234
00:55:46,539 --> 00:55:57,829
for us please. There will be four snakes on the ground. No, that's a diamond pickaxe. Give me that.

235
00:56:01,099 --> 00:56:05,719
I don't want to do this anymore. This is bringing like 50 people to dig this first

236
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:08,679
until we find a cool cave and find gold. Take the gold button and you're dead.

237
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:25,099
Who is this person? You know what? I'm killing this person. Like just kill this person.

238
00:56:25,099 --> 00:56:34,579
Look at how menacing that is. Okay, why am I on fire? Why am I on fire? Why am I on fire?

239
00:56:34,579 --> 00:56:50,820
Why am I on fire? Stop hitting me. Someone's going to drop a fucking canvass. All right,

240
00:56:50,820 --> 00:57:02,219
all the guards. Watch it. Watch it. Watch out for the Chad guy. Don't let him get away. Kill him

241
00:57:02,219 --> 00:57:25,719
please. PS2 mic. Is the stamina system working? I can't see anything.

242
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:56,710
Jeremiah, I can't eat anything. That sounds like a you problem. Wait, people in the castle? Since

243
00:57:56,710 --> 00:58:14,099
when? We have mining fatigue. I gotta get to the castle. Okay, I need to stop laughing. You can

244
00:58:14,099 --> 00:58:22,809
only eat cooked food, guys. Wait, I need my guards. There's people here. The castle's getting

245
00:58:22,809 --> 00:58:35,829
griefed? What? Guards to me please. The white list is broken. Oh, I know. It's fucked. The whole

246
00:58:35,829 --> 00:58:48,019
thing's fucked. Get Chad away from me. Sergeant Flakes. Good work. It's bread. How do I cook?

247
00:58:50,570 --> 00:59:09,639
Kill him. Kill him. You don't cook bread. You just eat it. What happened to the throne?

248
00:59:17,719 --> 00:59:29,349
All right. Let me give you this. Citizens of Earth, if there is not 100 iron bars

249
00:59:30,710 --> 00:59:38,820
given to the front of the castle in 15 minutes, 50 people are going to die

250
00:59:39,619 --> 00:59:51,989
at random starting now. 100 iron bars. There's like 200 of you here.

251
00:59:55,719 --> 01:00:04,199
I want it at the front of the castle. Nobody pick it up or I will execute 50 people.

252
01:00:04,199 --> 01:00:20,170
Nobody pick them up. Nobody touch them. We can't mine. We're babies. Look, we can't eat meat.

253
01:00:22,699 --> 01:00:30,300
Okay, listen. Listen. Very important. Listen to me. Inside of the red area where the town is,

254
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:37,019
you can't do anything. Outside of the city limits, outside of the town, the red line,

255
01:00:37,739 --> 01:00:44,139
you can do whatever you want. As long as you're over the age of five, you can mine. You can place

256
01:00:44,139 --> 01:00:57,000
blocks. You can eat. You're just inside the city limits. Child labor. It's not child labor.

257
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:09,110
How old are they? There's 12 people in the server. There's like 200 or 300 people in the server.

258
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:39,739
I don't see any gold, any iron bars up here. White list is broken. Open it back up. Open,

259
01:01:39,739 --> 01:01:51,800
open the first server up. Let's go. How does it feel to be number two Minecraft streamer on Twitch?

260
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:18,869
Yes, we don't even have one iron bar. I'm still waiting till age five. Chat, please. I'm starving.

261
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:35,929
Grrr. It's all baby population. You're the only person. Everyone's a literal child.

262
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:59,849
Nobody can do anything. The white list is fucked. King of the kindergarten. All right, I got an idea.

263
01:02:59,849 --> 01:03:04,920
I got an idea. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. I killed him. I got an idea. I got an idea.

264
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:33,380
Age everybody to 15. Go. Do it. Let's go. Somebody just died from a skeleton. I'm sorry to hear that.

265
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:43,639
Please don't steal two years of my life. Stealing years of my life, you king. I'm dying. I'm trapped

266
01:03:43,639 --> 01:03:48,280
in a building. Jerma, if you're eating this, fuck you. Food, please. I still have fucking mining

267
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:53,159
fatigue. At age 15, you've got mining fatigue. 15 you heard of. I was only three feet in front of me

268
01:03:53,159 --> 01:04:24,539
to be aged. Mining fatigue. This is how it was back in the day. I'm going to pee my pants.

269
01:04:24,539 --> 01:04:30,380
Somebody said Mike fatigue. All right. Hold on. Wait. All right. Guards. Important guards.

270
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:37,480
Protect me. I have to pee. Do not let me die. I actually have to go pee.

271
01:04:39,219 --> 01:04:42,500
Let a shitload of people on the server and fucking put everybody at age 15.

272
01:07:16,570 --> 01:07:35,510
Where am I? Where am I? You put me in a box? Why? All right. Well, get me out of here. How do I get

273
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:58,139
out of here? Oh, it's nighttime. Why are these people still in front of the castle gates?

274
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:18,220
I think all things dead. It crashed. I have to execute 50 people now. Well, good. Just come back

275
01:08:18,220 --> 01:08:26,579
in. I want to see some of the cool things that people have done in the outside of the town.

276
01:08:26,579 --> 01:08:38,760
I'm going for it. I'm going to go look. Just whitelist everyone. Oh yeah. Everything's broken.

277
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:47,619
Yeah. We, you know, you know, kill the music, kill the music. Let's talk real talk here.

278
01:08:48,979 --> 01:08:56,340
So the whitelisting server had some API issues, so we can't implement that now.

279
01:08:56,899 --> 01:09:02,500
So what we've done is just said, fuck it, and open the whole thing up. And sometimes when you

280
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:13,210
do that, you open up to thousands of connections at the same time. I'm still alive though. 128 RAM

281
01:09:13,210 --> 01:09:24,680
is not enough. There's like, there's like three servers here. You died. I did not die before. That

282
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:44,279
was not real. I just found diamond and now I can't rejoin. Fuck. I'm a cheater. Somebody just punched

283
01:09:44,279 --> 01:09:56,100
me. I don't know who it was. All right. Let's drop the whitelist server again. Open up the

284
01:09:56,100 --> 01:10:00,520
floodgates for like five minutes or so. A couple minutes. Get a bunch of people in here. Close it

285
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:18,840
up. I've been trying to mine wood for 10 years so I don't starve to death. Please help. That's so

286
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:27,930
funny. How do I get a shield? All right. I want to go look outside. Now that we have, there's a ton

287
01:10:27,930 --> 01:10:44,659
of people in here now. All right. You ready? I want to go look outside. I'm going this way. Please

288
01:10:44,659 --> 01:10:54,739
follow me. Guards. I'm going outside the city limits. Every time you say open up the server,

289
01:10:54,739 --> 01:11:03,750
it goes down. It's all good. I'm surprised that people are just following. I guess they're not

290
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:17,189
old enough to attack me. Oh, pog. I'm 15 now. Good. Yeah. I would just make everybody 15 and get

291
01:11:17,189 --> 01:11:31,449
rid of the mining fatigue. I heard an explosion somehow. I don't know what that was. All right.

292
01:11:31,449 --> 01:11:44,500
We're almost outside. Did anybody have anything interesting out here that I can see? Somebody has

293
01:11:44,500 --> 01:12:04,539
a crafting table and a furnace. Nobody can do anything. All right. Get him. Get him. Please

294
01:12:04,539 --> 01:12:12,359
get him. Don't let him do that. All right. Most people are 15 now. You shouldn't have mining

295
01:12:12,359 --> 01:12:28,729
fatigue anymore. Where's all the cool stuff in my kingdom? I'm too funny face. What is this? This

296
01:12:28,729 --> 01:12:35,130
is cool. How did you make this out of fucking fences? Let's break it. What does it take you?

297
01:12:35,130 --> 01:12:45,180
Like five years to make? All right. No, no, no. Stop, stop, stop. Don't break it. That's not nice.

298
01:12:45,899 --> 01:12:53,430
That's mean. That's mean. Let's keep moving. Here comes the heel turn. Oh, look. Somebody has a

299
01:12:53,430 --> 01:13:02,489
house out here. This is what I'm talking about. Watch out for that creeper. Kill that. Whose house

300
01:13:02,489 --> 01:13:10,170
is this? What's it say? Noodle's communal house. No rebels here. Just doing a quick inspection to

301
01:13:10,170 --> 01:13:15,159
make sure nothing is out of the ordinary. What do you have in here? I'll take those trees and you're

302
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:32,340
take that too. Okay. That's a nice little house you have there. Taxes? No, not yet. One house.

303
01:13:35,380 --> 01:13:54,649
Taxation equals theft. Taxation equals theft. How many players we got in the server? Can we open it

304
01:13:54,649 --> 01:14:02,359
up again? I would open it up again, try to get 200 and just get rid of all the limitations.

305
01:14:02,359 --> 01:14:07,000
Why is there an Enderman in here? Why is there an Enderman? Why is there an Enderman? There's an

306
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:24,340
Enderman in the server. I don't think that's supposed to be here. Maybe for a second. Maybe

307
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:30,899
bring in like 50 more people, 100 more people. Maybe. Why are you telling people to be creative

308
01:14:30,899 --> 01:14:39,979
when you'll ruin their creations? I didn't ruin anything. I just deleted a couple blocks.

309
01:14:39,979 --> 01:14:52,569
Nothing else over here. We opened it up. Oh shit. Somebody wrote, I'm in. Can anyone else not break

310
01:14:52,569 --> 01:14:58,170
blocks? When you get in the server, we're going to open it up so you don't have to worry about being

311
01:14:58,170 --> 01:15:19,579
a baby anymore. What is this? Why is this here? Cut this down. I don't like that. There's 150 to

312
01:15:19,579 --> 01:15:25,289
almost 200 people here. I'm trying to see if we can see anything. I want to go check out the community.

313
01:15:25,289 --> 01:15:46,119
Yeah, you guys have been babies for so long. Everyone's been a baby. So wait, does that mean

314
01:15:46,119 --> 01:15:56,779
that I've been killing babies? Is that what that means? Oh shit. I've been killing actual babies

315
01:15:56,779 --> 01:16:09,670
this whole time. So the guy that was chad-shriding, he was a baby. Yes, I'm a monster. I'm not though.

316
01:16:09,670 --> 01:16:22,119
Well, what are you doing? If you're a baby, why would you walk into the front door? Why would you

317
01:16:22,119 --> 01:16:27,880
come into the front door of the tower? You're just dead. Because he's a baby. He didn't know.

318
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:42,920
Yes, they did. Babies don't know. Yes, they do. Babies don't have logic. No, they just can't

319
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:54,979
mind blocks. Somebody, people are killing each other. All right, all right, we gotta be careful.

320
01:16:54,979 --> 01:17:09,319
We shouldn't roam too far. King, King Jerma, I'm starving. Three-year-old, help me, please.

321
01:17:09,319 --> 01:17:20,310
Okay, I'll help you. Where are you? I'm a man of the people. Where are you? Jerma, please, food,

322
01:17:20,310 --> 01:17:26,949
food. I'll help you. Where, who is this? What is this? What is that thing? What the hell was that?

323
01:17:26,949 --> 01:17:37,210
What the fuck was that? What was that? I'm lost, scared. Please guide me. I don't know where you,

324
01:17:37,210 --> 01:17:50,390
I don't know where I am. All right, let's make, let's go back. Jerma, I'm starving. Well, go get

325
01:17:50,390 --> 01:18:03,640
food. You have the whole outer bounds to look through. There's food everywhere. Please feed us.

326
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:09,960
You're my king. Please feed us. People are starving. I don't, I don't think that's a,

327
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:15,939
you should, where are the animals? There, I have a pig in front of me right now. I have three pigs

328
01:18:15,939 --> 01:18:22,199
in front of me. All right, can one of the guards please show me back to the castle? I have no idea

329
01:18:22,199 --> 01:18:39,930
where the fuck we're, and can we get the music back on too so I can fucking jam? That's, that's a

330
01:18:39,930 --> 01:18:57,500
little scoffed. Ooh. Little town. It's a quiet little village. Every day like the one before.

331
01:18:57,500 --> 01:19:13,380
It's so full of people here. So many things to see. So many people to talk to. My kingdom.

332
01:19:16,229 --> 01:19:33,029
Oh, for sure. There goes the baker with his tray of groceries. The only person following

333
01:19:33,029 --> 01:19:38,310
the guards and me. Every morning it's the same. The server can't handle more than a hundred people

334
01:19:38,310 --> 01:19:44,520
and there's no way we can do the game we wanted. Is that Belle? No, it's not Belle. It's another

335
01:19:44,520 --> 01:20:01,979
person, Jerma. Lots of groceries. I can't wait to, where, where is the fucking capital? I'm at,

336
01:20:01,979 --> 01:20:07,510
where's the capital? I don't know where we are. I have bread in my, who can, what does that mean?

337
01:20:08,149 --> 01:20:19,819
Someone's punching me. Where's the capital? I don't know where we are. This way?

338
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:39,100
All right, all right. We saw one house. Good. Don't die falling down. Someone's fucking punching me.

339
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:55,479
Is this the server? Am I in the right one? I can't, man. This is fucking so.

340
01:21:01,590 --> 01:21:17,560
Oh, watch these people. Whistle a wee to whistle my stuff. Oh, the crops are gone.

341
01:21:18,039 --> 01:21:39,750
My lord, there's no food anywhere. People are trying to plant new food. Oh, they're desperately

342
01:21:39,750 --> 01:22:42,020
trying to replace the food. Starving me. Jerma, please sign my love for bread. How many people

343
01:22:42,020 --> 01:22:53,380
are on the server now? Nobody can kill me because nobody can eat. Everyone's starving to death.

344
01:22:54,260 --> 01:23:02,250
There was a whole huge wheat farm right there and it's gone. It's empty. It's fucking empty.

345
01:23:03,460 --> 01:23:10,710
People are desperately planting new crops and I'm walking around. Nobody can even join.

346
01:23:16,630 --> 01:23:25,899
Oh my god, my fucking stomach hurts. It's my kingdom too. All right. Okay. I'm gonna plant

347
01:23:25,899 --> 01:23:40,220
some seeds. Isn't everybody still alive? What do you mean there's people in the throne room doing

348
01:23:40,220 --> 01:23:55,640
things to my throne? Guards with me, please. Get out of my way. What do you mean there's people

349
01:23:55,640 --> 01:24:01,140
doing things to my throne? What does that mean? The castle is full of skeletons. No, it's not.

350
01:24:04,090 --> 01:24:14,760
Get in there. Oh, my fucking chest. The second I saw the person with that, there's like one wall

351
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:25,960
built of their house. I mean, like, what the fuck, man? Somebody had like one wall of wood

352
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:42,649
and that was their house. What's wrong? What? Help me. Help, help, help, help, help, help, help. Help me.

353
01:24:46,489 --> 01:24:52,520
I need light. We need light. Chad, Chad, put light down here. We need light. We need light.

354
01:24:58,100 --> 01:25:02,659
Uh, someone's sleeping in my bed. Get dead. Whoever's in my bed is fucking dead.

355
01:25:03,380 --> 01:25:09,350
You're gonna sleep in the king's bed, for Christ's sake.

356
01:25:09,989 --> 01:25:47,180
I'm gonna sleep in my bed. Get out of my bed. How dare you. I'm gonna sleep. Watch out, watch out,

357
01:25:47,180 --> 01:26:06,630
watch out. He's trying to kill me. Hey, you got any coaches? Air for sale? You can't sell air in

358
01:26:06,630 --> 01:26:19,510
my kingdom, guys. Give me a bow. I'm gonna start sniping people. Fuck it. Let's go. Don't you fucking

359
01:26:19,510 --> 01:26:33,430
seriously? Who did that? Really? Get away from me. Get away from me. Don't come near me. Don't come

360
01:26:33,430 --> 01:26:42,899
near me. Don't come near me. Don't come near me. Don't come near me. The baby, this is the baby rush?

361
01:26:43,859 --> 01:26:50,520
The babies have just been sitting in the bed. German, my sire, you need a queen. Allow me to

362
01:26:50,520 --> 01:27:12,680
service you. Who's that? I'm sitting on the throne. I'm almost 50 years old, guys. Why? I'm not gonna

363
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:28,579
say that out loud. I don't know what that is. I will suck you for bread. Get them away from

364
01:27:28,579 --> 01:27:39,000
my throne. I don't want them even near me. Get out of here, you disgusting peasants.

365
01:27:39,000 --> 01:28:01,460
Cad the Brave, V.R. Josh the Virtual, and the person that just showed the escape route,

366
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:10,100
Will Sarcasm, the comedy comedian. I'd like for you to go out and find the pub inside of the kingdom.

367
01:28:11,609 --> 01:28:18,619
Go find the kingdom and take yourselves out of creative mode. I want to know more about this

368
01:28:18,619 --> 01:28:35,430
pub, but I'd like to know if it's kosher. A quest. Go on and find this pub that's been created.

369
01:28:35,430 --> 01:28:39,829
I've heard a pub has been created in my name. I'd like to maybe have a drink there.

370
01:28:49,689 --> 01:29:09,500
I'm dying, please. You'll figure it out. Scum. What was that? Watch the back entrance. Make sure

371
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:17,859
no one can get in the back. Someone took my bed. Greg from Nvidia, get out of the castle or you

372
01:29:17,859 --> 01:29:33,050
will die in 10 seconds. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two. Okay, they're okay.

373
01:29:36,979 --> 01:29:44,890
RDM, RDM admin, he killed me. Good luck. No, nobody liked that one.

374
01:29:51,289 --> 01:29:59,979
A nice bed that doesn't exist anymore. Oh, somebody took it and stole the bed. Now that's just

375
01:30:00,539 --> 01:30:12,619
interesting. Okay, they tried to, did they find a way behind? What is this? Can I get some light in

376
01:30:12,619 --> 01:30:21,720
here? What is this? Secret little hiding room? Get the fuck out of here. There's like diamonds back

377
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:35,939
here. How do I hold the torch out? What the fuck is going on over here? I didn't make this.

378
01:30:35,939 --> 01:30:41,100
Investigate this, please. Someone was trying to kill me when I lied down to go to sleep. I need

379
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:50,170
to eat food. The king has not eaten in like two days and watch this. This is kind of, this is

380
01:30:50,170 --> 01:31:03,029
ridiculous. Somebody got in here and made this. Who made that? I need food. Oh no, I got, I got,

381
01:31:03,029 --> 01:31:12,220
I got, I got. Well, let me just tell you guys something. If you're going to go for an assassination

382
01:31:12,220 --> 01:31:21,899
attempt, don't remove the bed. Get rid of the bed. That's like a giveaway that you're going to keep.

383
01:31:21,899 --> 01:31:37,380
Why would you take the bed? Sorry, we have found the pub. What's in the pub? Where is it? I'd like

384
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:45,590
to go have a drink at this pub. Okay, let's go. Somebody lead me to the pub. I'd like to have a

385
01:31:45,590 --> 01:31:54,539
drink at this new pub. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Please help

386
01:31:54,779 --> 01:32:18,260
me. Somebody's just rushed. Fuck him. Hold on, it is sword. Cowardly king. German die. I'm 51 years

387
01:32:18,260 --> 01:32:24,569
old. I'm, I'm going to live forever. All right, I'm coming. I would like a drink at the pub,

388
01:32:24,569 --> 01:32:43,220
please. What are they calling me? A boomer king. All right, the next person that writes that in chat

389
01:32:43,220 --> 01:32:52,489
is dead. Just, just slash kill them. Watch my back and watch the front. I mean like seriously,

390
01:32:52,489 --> 01:33:03,380
just slash kill whoever's in the pub. Watch out. Watch out in front of me. Greg from Nvidia, kill

391
01:33:03,380 --> 01:33:24,170
him. Greg from Nvidia, huh? You're not powering this stream. We're on AMD, motherfucker. I would

392
01:33:24,170 --> 01:33:33,159
like to be served a drink by the owner of the pub. Why did you kill that? Why did you kill? Oh,

393
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:45,079
they're fighting over food. He's like, I need to eat this. No, no, no, don't fight each other. Look,

394
01:33:45,079 --> 01:33:50,520
look, let me help you out here. Here. Somebody have a cooked t-shirt. Whatever the fuck this is.

395
01:33:50,520 --> 01:34:04,890
You're here. What a good king and Kingsman. Have a cooked t-shirt. Actual North Korea.

396
01:34:04,890 --> 01:34:20,409
I could use a drink. I heard a bow. Okay, guards be on the lookout. Seriously, I heard fucking bow.

397
01:34:20,409 --> 01:34:25,659
I heard like the dung. Somebody tried to shoot at me. I heard somebody shoot a bow.

398
01:34:25,659 --> 01:34:36,020
Why is there an Enderman? Someone's trying to snipe me right now. I, I stand in front of me.

399
01:34:36,020 --> 01:34:44,729
Okay, kill that guy. Kill the default Minecraft Steve guy. Okay, good. See you later. Guards,

400
01:34:44,729 --> 01:35:01,510
go in front of me and behind me. I'm so nervous. This is the pub. Why is this the only structure?

401
01:35:01,510 --> 01:35:06,279
Property of the king. Yeah, that's right. It is, but there seems to be too many people in it.

402
01:35:06,279 --> 01:35:16,979
I'm going to die. That's not a pub. That's a human box. There's nothing. I can't get in there.

403
01:35:16,979 --> 01:35:21,909
Make it bigger. I'm not going in there until it's bigger. It's a trap. I'm not going in.

404
01:35:28,489 --> 01:35:42,340
Imagine windows. Okay, what's he doing? I'm not going in until everyone's out. Everyone get up.

405
01:35:42,340 --> 01:35:46,100
Jeremy, how does it feel to have the worst stream on Twitch?

406
01:35:51,500 --> 01:36:03,899
I'm going in. Okay, everyone get up. Why are there animals in here? Why are there animals in here?

407
01:36:03,899 --> 01:36:34,869
I think the server crashed. I just wanted a drink. Oh, we still actually live? The chicken spawns

408
01:36:34,869 --> 01:36:45,210
crashed. Oh my God. I'm fucking, I've like been laughing too much. Wait, wait, where? Okay, wait.

409
01:36:45,210 --> 01:36:51,270
I'm sending too many packets. What the fuck are you talking about? All right, we're good. We're

410
01:36:51,270 --> 01:37:04,539
good. We're good. Okay. Here's the shop. Beer Baron. No, interesting. I will take one of your

411
01:37:04,539 --> 01:37:13,800
finest beers. I would like to knock and punch in the face. Potion of fire resistance. What is this?

412
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:30,380
I don't think you made this. What's that? Ooh, I will take a apple juice, please, because I don't

413
01:37:30,380 --> 01:37:47,659
drink this day on my A game. There's nothing in there. A finest apple juice. Okay, I'll take one.

414
01:37:47,659 --> 01:38:02,460
Block the door so no one can get in, please. Luis cheese, please give that to me. What is it? Salt?

415
01:38:03,100 --> 01:38:16,890
This is fucking trash. Give me something better or I'll burn it to the ground. Water. Oh, let me try

416
01:38:16,890 --> 01:38:28,489
this. That's pretty good. Pretty delicious, actually. Very good. Do you have anything

417
01:38:28,489 --> 01:38:37,189
else for me to try? Keep these peasants away from me. I'm starving.

418
01:38:39,590 --> 01:38:52,119
I'm a little starving trying to get in here. How do you make mushroom soup? I don't know. I have no idea.

419
01:38:54,420 --> 01:39:01,560
Watch it. Somebody got blooded by a creeper. You knew it was gonna happen.

420
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:21,449
Somebody got killed by a creeper. What is this? A nutrient? Pork? I'd love to try it. What is this?

421
01:39:21,449 --> 01:39:36,600
Why are you on fire? Excuse me, stop. Okay, hold on. Here.

422
01:39:39,850 --> 01:39:46,819
You actually blocked it off. Here, take some of this. Go adventure somewhere. Go make something.

423
01:39:47,930 --> 01:39:57,399
Take these. King Jerma is sponsored by Burger King. Not true. Rid of that. Oh, the rat's tail pub.

424
01:39:57,399 --> 01:40:15,350
All right, yeah. Jerma, I have a flower for you. Do you? Let me out of here. A flower. I'll take it.

425
01:40:17,590 --> 01:40:47,619
Let me see it. Oh, wow. Any other structures to see? I have raw meat for you. Why don't you eat it?

426
01:40:50,420 --> 01:41:04,170
Oops. I need to eat. I'm actually gonna be in trouble if I don't eat. Trading diamond pickaxe

427
01:41:04,170 --> 01:41:09,850
for food. That's because I know where you got that diamond pickaxe. You found that on the staircase

428
01:41:09,850 --> 01:41:15,420
because I dropped it on the ground. Don't listen. Don't trade with that person. I dropped that on

429
01:41:15,420 --> 01:41:36,789
the ground. There's a sky fort in my kingdom I'd like to see. Take me to it. Oh, let's just walk.

430
01:41:37,510 --> 01:41:53,770
The way it's intended to. I'm 56 years old. When do I start to slow down? It's gonna take a little

431
01:41:53,770 --> 01:42:10,760
time. I'm gonna burn that bitch down. Okay. What? It's a trap. Is it a trap? All right,

432
01:42:10,760 --> 01:42:16,760
guards, take me to it. Epic grass. Epic. Hey, epic grass, please. I'm freeing right now.

433
01:42:19,340 --> 01:42:25,109
Another small kingdom. This is for you because you're in a fucking Pokemon skin. That's pretty

434
01:42:25,109 --> 01:42:33,189
cool. Take this. Feed your family with it tonight. Oh, and take a couple of these, too. And I guess

435
01:42:33,189 --> 01:42:40,789
like a shitload of cobblestone because why did you? Why did you do? Why did you do? Why did you do

436
01:42:40,789 --> 01:42:51,210
that? That guy had a lot of stuff. That guy had a lot of stuff. That guy had gold gear. Why would

437
01:42:51,210 --> 01:43:02,250
you do that? Why did you do something like that? What's wrong with you? That wasn't a guard. That

438
01:43:02,250 --> 01:43:13,020
was a random dude. That wasn't a guard. That was a random. Wait, who? It wasn't a guard? All right,

439
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:18,539
who's punching me? All right, kill Garfield because Garfield sucks. All right, that's all

440
01:43:18,539 --> 01:43:31,529
I gotta say. All right, take me to the sky fort and light the way. Why did that person die?

441
01:43:34,170 --> 01:43:44,069
Look, if you got a Garfield Hawaiian shirt skin, I'm sorry, but like you just that's you die.

442
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:51,479
Oh shit, look at this. What's over here? What is it? Oh, skeleton. Somebody get that.

443
01:43:51,479 --> 01:44:03,510
Oh, can we open up the server to like another 100 people? Furnace workbench. Oh, that's nice.

444
01:44:03,510 --> 01:44:13,989
That's beautiful. Interesting. Very interesting. What is this? Hey, baby blood is on your hands.

445
01:44:13,989 --> 01:44:31,109
It doesn't need to be there. I broke the king's throne and all I got with it. So is you. You stole

446
01:44:31,109 --> 01:44:40,819
my bread. You stole my bed. You just took my bed from me. All right, where's the sky? What was that?

447
01:44:40,819 --> 01:44:58,859
Seriously, what was that? Who's punching me? All right, sky for it. Let's go. What's down here?

448
01:44:58,859 --> 01:45:07,300
Somebody died in there. Okay, take me to the sky for it. Give me 15. I'm a good boy. You gotta wait.

449
01:45:07,300 --> 01:45:26,859
Why is everybody pumped? Whatever. Where's the sky for it? Holy shit. Is that it right here?

450
01:45:26,859 --> 01:46:05,460
Who just died? Why did that person die? Oh shit. This is Dicks cannot be stopped. Oh, I see. It's

451
01:46:05,460 --> 01:46:21,340
a giant dick. It's just a dick. Good. Take this down. Is this the sky for it that I was told exists?

452
01:46:21,340 --> 01:46:34,020
This is not even a dick. You know, the funniest thing is seeing the chat and seeing people die

453
01:46:34,020 --> 01:46:43,060
from falling off edges and stuff. So and so has died from falling. Well, sorry. What's over here?

454
01:46:43,060 --> 01:47:17,670
There's a huge structure. Drop the chest plate. Let me take this down. Wait, what is this?

455
01:47:17,670 --> 01:47:36,020
There's a nice mic, buddy. Is that better? Wait, why can't I? I can't destroy this. King,

456
01:47:36,020 --> 01:47:49,449
there are monsters everywhere in your castle. You suck. Good use of your, like, six years of your

457
01:47:49,449 --> 01:48:18,539
life. What else is over here? Germa is tiny. Can you see who placed blocks in the server? I want

458
01:48:18,539 --> 01:48:36,010
that person to be killed in front of me. Signed? Where's the, where's the sign? I want them dead

459
01:48:36,010 --> 01:48:52,199
in front of me. Take this down. Disgusting. Absolutely fucking disgusting. Get rid of this.

460
01:48:52,199 --> 01:48:56,819
And again, I gotta ask, what's going on? Help, help, help, help, help. Stop, stop, stop. Fight

461
01:48:56,819 --> 01:49:05,420
them. Kill them. Yeah, nice try. Okay. Okay, we're getting some more. All right, this guy,

462
01:49:05,420 --> 01:49:15,670
kill this guy in the gold armor, in the guy in the gold armor. Kill the guy in the gold armor.

463
01:49:15,670 --> 01:49:23,109
He was following behind it for so long. He was walking behind this for a long time. Selling

464
01:49:23,109 --> 01:49:27,109
a strange rocket launcher with airborne enemies killed. Oh, well, you're not going to get shit

465
01:49:27,109 --> 01:49:46,180
for that. That's a terrible strange. Oh, another house. What is this? Don't fall off this. This is

466
01:49:46,180 --> 01:49:55,340
guaranteed death if I fall off. Can y'all age us? LOL. Just break it. Fuck the kingdom.

467
01:49:56,819 --> 01:50:11,449
I can't even. Good thing I have diamond armor on. Who is it? Who did the tiny sign? I want to know.

468
01:50:12,409 --> 01:50:22,890
Let's put them on trial. I want to put them on trial. Oh, it was Jonas? Okay. Teleport me

469
01:50:22,890 --> 01:50:29,100
to my throne room. Put them in the throne room. Surround them. Put guards. I want to trial right

470
01:50:29,100 --> 01:50:38,659
now. We know who it is. Put me in the throne. Teleport them to the throne room and like six

471
01:50:38,659 --> 01:50:51,420
guards surround them. I want to know what they did. I want to know why. What do you think was

472
01:50:51,420 --> 01:50:54,699
going to happen? Do you think you're going to kill me? Is it Scarfield Bracket again?

473
01:51:01,770 --> 01:51:09,220
So I would like to have a small meeting of the council. Bring the culprit in front of me into

474
01:51:09,220 --> 01:51:24,439
the throne room, please. What did you say their name was? Jonas. Get them in here. Did they die?

475
01:51:26,039 --> 01:51:30,979
Are they dead? They're just dead. They've been dead for like 30 minutes.

476
01:51:39,029 --> 01:51:45,850
They haven't been part of the game in like an hour. They built that and fucking fell and died.

477
01:51:46,489 --> 01:51:58,789
Bring him in here. Bring him. Who was it? John Comcast? Oh, I know that son of a bitch. Bring

478
01:51:58,789 --> 01:52:12,500
him into the throne room. John Comcast did it. Bring him into the throne. Surround him. John

479
01:52:12,500 --> 01:52:21,500
Comcast, you stand accused of writing slander against the king. Something along the lines of

480
01:52:21,500 --> 01:52:37,699
how tiny I am. Would you like to plead your case to Comcast? This is the wrong guy. No, it's not.

481
01:52:40,100 --> 01:52:46,069
I'm 31. I'm almost all this germa. Nice booster seat is what John Comcast says.

482
01:52:46,869 --> 01:52:53,500
Well, that just confirms that I have made a sentencing for you to die.

483
01:52:54,300 --> 01:52:58,140
How do you think about that, John Comcast? I said your name wrong. Don't kill him yet. I want to

484
01:52:58,140 --> 01:53:08,140
hear what he has to say. I'm on a booster seat. Isn't that funny? Public execution for John

485
01:53:08,140 --> 01:53:13,449
Comcast. By the way, you suck. What's happening to me? Somebody coming in the back. Somebody

486
01:53:13,449 --> 01:53:17,289
trying to get the back door. Somebody coming in the back door. Somebody coming to the back door.

487
01:53:17,289 --> 01:53:28,340
Don't kill him. Was it a zombie? What? John Comcast, for your crimes, I have determined

488
01:53:28,340 --> 01:53:38,380
that you will be, is he dead? What do you mean he ran away? How did he run away? There's like 10 of

489
01:53:38,380 --> 01:53:50,949
us. What? What do you mean he ran away? You don't run away? There's 10 people here. What? Get them

490
01:53:50,949 --> 01:54:05,369
back in here. He's dead. Somebody killed him. Who killed him? Get Screen Freak. Get him in the

491
01:54:05,369 --> 01:54:08,970
throne room. He killed John Comcast without a trial. Get Screen Freak in the throne room,

492
01:54:08,970 --> 01:54:15,859
please. I'm drowning. My apartment is pretty compromised. I actually am drowning. Somebody

493
01:54:15,859 --> 01:54:21,779
help me. How do I get out of here? How do I get out of my toilet? Okay, I'm dead serious. I'm

494
01:54:21,779 --> 01:54:29,829
gonna actually drown here. I don't have to get out. Thank you. Get them in here. We have a new

495
01:54:29,829 --> 01:54:38,380
trial, please. Teleport them into the room. Screen Freak, you stand accused of killing somebody that

496
01:54:38,380 --> 01:54:46,680
made a funny German 985 is tiny sign. Is he dead? Oh. Screen Freak, how do you plead? You killed

497
01:54:46,680 --> 01:54:51,960
somebody that made a sign that said German 985 is tiny and you killed them. Are you trying to act

498
01:54:51,960 --> 01:55:00,380
upon the king's wishes or was that for? It was a display of loyalty. I'm not guilty. Interesting.

499
01:55:00,380 --> 01:55:07,689
Display of loyalty. The next person that hits me from behind fucking delete their IP. Okay,

500
01:55:07,689 --> 01:55:20,949
just delete them. Okay. Why am I on fire? What the fuck? Why is the king on fire? Screen Freak,

501
01:55:20,949 --> 01:55:26,390
I would like to hear in two full sentences. German, I'm his lawyer. Please let me help.

502
01:55:27,699 --> 01:55:32,600
Don't kill, don't kill. All right, kill this guy because this guy is being a fucking sick one.

503
01:55:32,600 --> 01:55:39,000
All right, we have a lawyer. John Comcast. That's the castle again. Can we please bring in his

504
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:42,920
lawyer? What's your, who's your lawyer? Screen Freak, would you like to be represented by a

505
01:55:42,920 --> 01:55:55,319
lawyer? He has the right to legal representation. He doesn't. Lock him in. It's me. Screen Freak,

506
01:55:55,319 --> 01:56:07,479
do you have legal representation? God, somebody is burning me from below. Do I have food? What is

507
01:56:07,479 --> 01:56:13,319
all this trash? Okay. Protect me. Seriously, protect me. I'm going to die. Protect me. I'm 65.

508
01:56:14,279 --> 01:56:27,399
There's a slaughter. There's a slaughter. I was killed. We didn't even get to have a trial.

509
01:56:28,739 --> 01:56:39,020
He's dead. Save me. Okay, I need food. I need food right now. First of all, you know what?

510
01:56:39,020 --> 01:56:44,439
Fuck it. Where are the peasants? Are they watching this trial? Get over here. Here, just here. Take

511
01:56:44,439 --> 01:56:54,020
this shit. All of you. Why are you a zombie? Just take this. Look, I'm being a good king for once.

512
01:56:55,029 --> 01:57:02,180
Cobblestone to build your house. I don't care what you do with this. Somebody punched me. I

513
01:57:02,180 --> 01:57:06,100
don't know who it was. Look at the logs. It was a zombie guy. It was a zombie guy. It was a zombie

514
01:57:06,100 --> 01:57:29,989
guy. The guy that is a zombie skin killer. I need food. The king requires food. I have 61 fucking

515
01:57:29,989 --> 01:57:35,270
seeds. What do I have seeds for? What the hell do I have this for? My subjects, please come into the

516
01:57:35,270 --> 01:57:41,510
fountain area. We have somebody on trial. We have two scoops. Why is two scoops in the trial dungeon?

517
01:57:43,800 --> 01:57:51,189
What did two scoops do? Overload the machines until they learn their fucking lesson.

518
01:57:54,630 --> 01:58:04,760
What did two scoops do? I don't feel confident. I'm going up to my... I want two guards with me

519
01:58:04,760 --> 01:58:17,699
to balcony at all times, please. How many people are in the server? Can we open the server back up

520
01:58:17,699 --> 01:58:28,140
again for another few minutes? Get another hundred people in here? Okay, 142. Maybe get

521
01:58:28,140 --> 01:58:34,579
another 50 people in here. You're throwing seeds at a 15-year-old. Everything's fine.

522
01:58:36,739 --> 01:58:43,319
Ladies and gentlemen, if we could get everyone to pay attention to the trial of... I'm gonna

523
01:58:43,319 --> 01:58:48,789
get pushed off this. I'm not fucking sitting here. That's stupid. That's a stupid idea, actually. Like

524
01:58:48,789 --> 01:58:57,000
an actual dumb fucking idea. I only have one, two, three, four, five... There's like 20 people here.

525
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:03,319
That means there's a hundred plus people somewhere up. Motherfucker. Motherfucker. Motherfucker. Help

526
01:59:03,319 --> 01:59:07,000
me. Help me. Help me. Just start killing people. Just start killing fucking citizens. I don't care.

527
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:19,460
I'm 68. I'm almost... I'm almost fucking 70 years old. Watch out. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.

528
01:59:19,460 --> 01:59:32,550
Garfield. He just did 35 gold ore. Wow. Now listen to me. Who's shooting fucking bows and arrows?

529
01:59:35,380 --> 01:59:44,539
I have a proposition for people in the town. If you would like gold bars, come to the front

530
01:59:45,270 --> 01:59:50,500
of the castle doors. What is this? What is that? What is... I don't have any...

531
01:59:50,500 --> 02:00:04,409
This gives me diamond armor. Look at all this bread I have. Citizens of the kingdom, please,

532
02:00:04,409 --> 02:00:16,279
if you could come to... The good king is going to give you all bread and let you live. The good

533
02:00:16,279 --> 02:00:25,300
king will shower you with gifts if you are kind and gentle. And you can go about your day as a

534
02:00:25,300 --> 02:00:35,659
peasant in my wonderful kingdom. I have bread. I have 60 bread to the... Kill the person attacking

535
02:00:35,659 --> 02:00:44,340
me, please. I have 60 bread that will go... 20 of which will go to the victor of the trial by combat

536
02:00:44,340 --> 02:00:53,159
we are going to state right now, which, by the way, I have decided two scoops and John Comcast

537
02:00:54,039 --> 02:00:58,359
are going to be in the trial by combat. Please give them diamond armor, diamond swords,

538
02:00:58,359 --> 02:01:04,760
diamond everything. Put them into the pen and let them fight. Whoever wins gets 60 bread.

539
02:01:04,760 --> 02:01:11,659
Bye-bye, entertainment! Trial by combat. The next person that hits me, ban them from the server

540
02:01:11,659 --> 02:01:19,800
permanently. John Comcast and two scoops of the two that will be inside the trial by fucking combat.

541
02:01:19,800 --> 02:01:25,619
Make a pen for me. This is for me to enjoy my entertainment. Anybody that attacks me

542
02:01:25,619 --> 02:01:37,260
just fucking bury them into the ground six feet under for fuck's sake. Trial by combat.

543
02:01:37,260 --> 02:01:50,340
I want a good view. I'll get in my second house. What? What is that? That's concrete.

544
02:01:52,810 --> 02:01:57,770
I haven't found a single iron ore. I'm sorry to hear that. I wonder how long you've been in

545
02:01:57,770 --> 02:02:05,500
the server for. Remember, this is for 60 bread. You could feed a whole community with this for

546
02:02:05,500 --> 02:02:23,619
days. It's for 60 bread. The guards are all still in creative. All guards type this into the chat

547
02:02:23,699 --> 02:02:30,729
slash game mode space survival. Do it. What's wrong with my armor? I'm good. I have fucking

548
02:02:30,729 --> 02:02:37,930
blue pants on. I'm good. We're not in creative. Well, then you tell these fucking pussies.

549
02:02:37,930 --> 02:02:48,060
Get a good view. Two. Oh, well, I'm down here now. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, Godie. Okay. I

550
02:02:48,060 --> 02:02:56,710
just keep. Cad. Cad, give me. Protect me. Protect your king. Oh, God. Gold. Gold. Give me up. Give

551
02:02:56,710 --> 02:02:59,829
me up. Give me up. Give me up. Give me up. Give me up. Give me up. Give me up. Give me up.

552
02:03:09,109 --> 02:03:23,829
Dare you. How dare you, you fucking scumbag. Ow. Where's the box? Where's the box? What happened?

553
02:03:23,829 --> 02:03:37,979
Why did we get teleported? I want everyone in the server at this spot to watch this. Cheater. I

554
02:03:37,979 --> 02:03:48,090
don't even know I cheated. And I want my own throne over here. There's too many wizard cheats.

555
02:03:48,090 --> 02:03:55,479
Nobody's cheating. German is hacking. Oh, for the love of fuck. Get me out of here. Get me out. Just

556
02:03:55,479 --> 02:03:58,600
get me out. Get me out. Get me out. Get me out. Get me out. Get me out. Get me out. Get me out.

557
02:03:58,600 --> 02:04:04,920
Get me out. Get me out. Get me out. Get me out. Get me out. Get me out. Get me out. Get me out.

558
02:04:04,920 --> 02:04:18,460
Get me out. I'm 71. I have to make it 100. All right. Oh, my God. Why the fuck am I going in

559
02:04:18,460 --> 02:04:30,619
here again? What the fuck? All right. Get me out. Get me out. Get me out. Get me out. Also, by the

560
02:04:30,619 --> 02:04:35,609
way, the throne room is under attack. Can one of the guards please go examine what's going on in

561
02:04:35,609 --> 02:04:45,930
the throne room and take care of it, please? Okay. I want two scoops and I want John Comcast

562
02:04:45,930 --> 02:04:57,079
inside of the... You know what? Just start murdering civilians. I'm going back to my throne.

563
02:04:57,079 --> 02:05:06,729
I'm going to my bed. Fuck this. Why is it always devolved into a massacre? Because people

564
02:05:06,729 --> 02:05:13,829
are trying to kill me. You asked us here. All right. Look, I am going to go up to my balcony

565
02:05:13,829 --> 02:05:18,630
and I want a box built here that's big enough for two people to fight in. If you go in that box,

566
02:05:18,630 --> 02:05:26,069
you're dead. I want John Comcast, who's on trial, and two scoops, who's a random fucking person,

567
02:05:26,069 --> 02:05:40,279
to be put in there and fight to the death. Whoever wins gets 35 gold bars. Good luck.

568
02:05:40,279 --> 02:05:52,329
All that... Where's... We can't get back up. To the throne room. To my bedroom. They just...

569
02:06:02,869 --> 02:06:18,420
I have a bed still. What the fuck is this? All right. Amuse me. What's going on with this mic?

570
02:06:18,420 --> 02:06:26,100
I don't know. There are assassins in the castle. Well, don't let... I want a good view. Shit. Get

571
02:06:26,100 --> 02:06:44,090
them away from me. I'm 71 goddamn years old. I'm almost dead in a whole decade. All right. Get

572
02:06:44,090 --> 02:06:58,020
John Comcast and two scoops. Ooh. Oops. Jeremy, you got some nice stuff. Okay.

573
02:06:58,579 --> 02:07:12,250
John Comcast is dead. Fuck it. Do me a favor. What in the name of God is going on right now?

574
02:07:12,250 --> 02:07:26,010
He's right there. Did he die? Jeremy's in creative. I'm not in creative. I'm in fucking

575
02:07:26,010 --> 02:07:42,979
survival. Oblivion mic. Garfield's back. Well, he'll be dead soon when I see him. All right.

576
02:07:42,979 --> 02:07:50,310
How many people have gotten the servant now? What? Holy shit. Holy shit. That was brilliant.

577
02:07:50,310 --> 02:07:55,960
That was absolutely fucking brilliant. But thank God I'm still alive. Wow. That was brilliant.

578
02:07:55,960 --> 02:08:06,220
Good work, but didn't work. Holy fuck. Okay. Well, people are fucking falling down. Somebody made a

579
02:08:06,220 --> 02:08:18,680
death trap and I had diamond armor. Why am I still alive? Put some torches out here, please.

580
02:08:18,680 --> 02:08:25,979
Seriously, because I don't know what the hell's down here. I'm not in creative.

581
02:08:30,460 --> 02:08:39,369
I'm not cheating. I'm not in creative. I swear to God. I have pants and boots on.

582
02:08:41,210 --> 02:09:02,310
Jump twice. See? I have a hunger bar. Look, I can eat and shit. Oh, we need to get back up. How do

583
02:09:02,310 --> 02:09:13,850
we get? We need to get back up there. This is huge. Boots and pants, boots and pants. Yeah. I have

584
02:09:13,850 --> 02:09:18,260
just like a pair of pants on. All right. I'm going up. I'm just going to build up. Fuck it.

585
02:09:19,220 --> 02:09:43,340
Oh, I can get out. How do I? I don't have an axe. Somebody just got killed by a spider.

586
02:09:44,060 --> 02:10:08,979
Wow. That's embarrassing. All right. Get us out of here, Will. Somebody planned this really well,

587
02:10:08,979 --> 02:10:24,420
actually. Oh shit. I'm killing you. I'm sorry. How deep is this shit? Seriously? What the fuck?

588
02:10:25,060 --> 02:10:53,640
What the fuck? Was somebody up here waiting for us? We can't get up. Oh fuck. We're on fire.

589
02:10:53,640 --> 02:11:14,920
Why are we on fire? Who's firing us? Let's go back to the town. That was a reverse stream snipe.

590
02:11:19,619 --> 02:11:29,689
I'm 74 years old. If I turn 100, I'm dead. Oh, I'm right here. All right. No, I'm right here. All

591
02:11:29,689 --> 02:11:43,899
right. Are we ready? What are they in for armor? If I could please be aware. Are they in leather?

592
02:11:49,289 --> 02:11:56,340
Okay. Whoever wins this gets to take 60 bread back to... Why are you taking all your clothes off?

593
02:11:56,340 --> 02:12:11,619
Don't need it. Two scoops thinks they don't need it. Okay. John Comcast and two scoops,

594
02:12:11,619 --> 02:12:15,460
you have been declared trialed by combat. I wish you luck in the wars to come.

595
02:12:15,460 --> 02:12:22,539
Game of Thrones reference. Yeah, Game of Thrones reference. Good luck. Commence the battle. Battle

596
02:12:22,539 --> 02:12:31,109
commencing in five, four, three, two, one. Good luck to them. They want to get 60 bread to take

597
02:12:31,109 --> 02:12:36,649
back to their community and fucking build another pub. Who cares? I think the server crashed.

598
02:12:37,449 --> 02:13:00,819
Dermot's dead. Oh, oh, F exclamation point. Big F on the server. Oh, there we are. And there's two

599
02:13:00,819 --> 02:13:12,569
other people inside of the box. Let's make an incentive. Ah, it's brilliant. Throw food.

600
02:13:12,569 --> 02:13:38,090
I'm only wearing pants? I know. I think we lost everybody. I'm disappointed, Dermot. You're

601
02:13:38,090 --> 02:13:46,100
feeding your Napoleon complex by just cheating at a five-year-old game. You could have embraced your

602
02:13:46,100 --> 02:13:57,300
interjects and put your and your team of corrupt mods have ruined it. OK, fine. Fuck it. All guards,

603
02:13:57,300 --> 02:14:02,819
take off your armor, please. Let's see how much I give a shit about that. Take off. All guards,

604
02:14:02,819 --> 02:14:25,430
take your. OK, fine. Stop the trial. John Comcast is innocent. It was Jonas Bones was the real

605
02:14:25,430 --> 02:14:33,020
culprit. He has returned. Well, get him and John Comcast in the trial by combat. Let them kill

606
02:14:33,020 --> 02:14:44,619
each other. Get them inside of that circle. Jonas Bones and John Comcast, lawyer versus client.

607
02:14:48,970 --> 02:14:54,869
John Comcast did nothing wrong in his face. Do you think his fate? Do you think I care?

608
02:14:56,180 --> 02:14:59,859
He came to your defense and now you're going to have to come to your own

609
02:15:00,579 --> 02:15:17,479
against his blade. Good luck. All right. Are we ready? Jonas bonus versus John Comcast in the

610
02:15:17,479 --> 02:15:30,649
trial by me. All right. Let's start it up. Trial by combat. Can we get some appropriate music for

611
02:15:30,649 --> 02:15:44,149
this, please? John Comcast, you don't scare. You don't stand accused of anything. Jonas made the

612
02:15:44,789 --> 02:15:49,270
tiny thing so you just be banned forever and like fuck you. But we're going to have you fight.

613
02:15:49,270 --> 02:15:59,140
John Comcast, the discernment if you're going to stay in the server permanently or not.

614
02:15:59,140 --> 02:16:05,939
Serial box microphone is really taken off. When I say go, I would like for you to attack each other.

615
02:16:07,739 --> 02:16:13,260
Jonas bonus. Good luck. John Comcast, you're absolutely innocent, but you're just here for

616
02:16:13,260 --> 02:16:23,210
some breathing. Good. Three, one. Commence the battle for my amusement.

617
02:16:37,959 --> 02:16:45,719
One hit. He did it great. John Comcast is the victor of the battle. He hit him once and he died.

618
02:16:45,719 --> 02:17:00,260
I just killed a baby. John Comcast, congratulations.

619
02:17:04,899 --> 02:17:10,500
Put me in here. John Comcast, I'd like to present to you what you have won as a victory prize.

620
02:17:12,379 --> 02:17:20,840
You've won a full at least year supply of bread and Comcast killed the server

621
02:17:21,639 --> 02:17:26,340
right at the exact moment that he died. F in the chat.

622
02:17:32,549 --> 02:17:44,010
My stomach fucking hurts, man. This is so fucking ridiculous. Who would have thought that having

623
02:17:44,010 --> 02:17:54,379
thousands of people connected to the same place was a bad idea. John Comcast, correct. You have won.

624
02:17:54,379 --> 02:18:06,840
Where's John Comcast? Are they back in the server? Jerma, you're feeding your Garfield complex by just

625
02:18:06,840 --> 02:18:11,959
cheating a Garfield year old game. You could have embraced your inner Garfield and rose to the

626
02:18:12,840 --> 02:18:22,950
union. What are you talking about? John Comcast, congratulations. Please take this supply of food

627
02:18:22,950 --> 02:18:34,680
forever. John Comcast is with us again. I would like to go in the box of John Comcast. What the

628
02:18:34,680 --> 02:18:47,219
fuck just happened? Garfield is dead. John Comcast, please take your at least 10 year supply of food

629
02:18:47,219 --> 02:19:11,430
and your 35 gold bars. Congratulations. Nice work. Okay, now fuck off before I change my mind.

630
02:19:12,069 --> 02:19:17,670
I'm 81 years old. It's time for the mods to take their armor off and replace it with leather armor.

631
02:19:17,670 --> 02:19:35,290
This is a stadia server. Get out of here. All king's guards take all of their armor off.

632
02:19:35,290 --> 02:19:50,149
Why did you kill him? There was no reason for him to die. He was in gold armor. How did he die?

633
02:19:50,149 --> 02:20:00,229
Why is there an ear of corn over here? Help me. Help me, please. Help me. Somebody in the box

634
02:20:00,229 --> 02:20:07,829
jumped in the box, tried to kill me. All right, I'm out. Get me out. Seriously. Protect me. Seriously.

635
02:20:07,829 --> 02:20:14,459
Help me. Help me. Help me. Help me. I don't want to. All right, I'm going back in the throne room.

636
02:20:14,459 --> 02:20:25,370
Fuck this. They're revolting. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm going to the throne.

637
02:20:25,370 --> 02:20:32,579
Oh, fuck. People are dead. Oh my fucking god. They're chasing me. I need people

638
02:20:32,579 --> 02:20:42,280
follow me up to the bedroom. How long have you been streaming for? It's been two hours. Holy fuck.

639
02:20:42,280 --> 02:20:50,329
Wait, somebody's in my bedroom. Somebody's in my, I gotta get up. Where are my guards? Where are my

640
02:20:50,329 --> 02:20:56,620
guards? Where are my guards? Where are my guards? The guy, oh, no, no, no, no. You're good. You're

641
02:20:56,620 --> 02:21:19,110
good. I'd like to see that sky. Where's the sky? Okay, all the mods are not, there's only one mod

642
02:21:19,110 --> 02:21:36,680
that's diamond gear. ADHD. I want to see what people have built outside the town. Mods are

643
02:21:36,680 --> 02:21:52,860
corrupt. Let's go take a look. Am I going to die if I do this? Holy shit. No, I'm good. All right.

644
02:21:52,860 --> 02:22:02,920
I want to go see that sky town. That's right. I'm eating bread in front of people that are starving.

645
02:22:02,920 --> 02:22:11,770
What are you going to do about it? All right, man. Hey, man, stand up. Stand up. Stand up. Stand up.

646
02:22:11,770 --> 02:22:38,889
The retired king. Watch behind me. They're fucking fighting me. They're killing me. Help me. Anybody

647
02:22:38,889 --> 02:22:43,860
that's around? Okay, this is like 30. All right, I gotta run. I gotta run. I have to run. I have

648
02:22:43,860 --> 02:22:52,540
to run. The king has to fucking run. Somebody help, please. That's a creeper. That's a creeper.

649
02:22:52,540 --> 02:23:01,319
That's a creeper. Help, help, help, help. I just want to see the cool structures that people may

650
02:23:01,319 --> 02:23:20,520
have built. All right, the corn guy's freaking me out. Just get rid of him. All right, where's

651
02:23:20,520 --> 02:23:32,379
the sky town? I heard, hey, German, there's a cool sky town that's being built. Where is it? I just

652
02:23:32,379 --> 02:23:36,409
want to, I want to see it. I want to see where it is. I want to see what the cool shit people in my

653
02:23:36,409 --> 02:23:56,709
kingdom have been making. He fell for the sky town ruse. Is that for real? It's part of the

654
02:23:56,709 --> 02:24:05,620
farmer's guild. Where is that? No one made anything, German. They were killed by your guards.

655
02:24:22,819 --> 02:24:34,889
They just died. Somebody tried to put something together, but it didn't work. Let me finish it,

656
02:24:34,889 --> 02:24:57,190
motherfucker. This is my statue. Oh my God. What's this? Wait, wait, wait. What's this? What's this?

657
02:25:04,200 --> 02:25:29,350
Oh, what a shit show. I fucking love it. So you are a big stinky. Oh, wow. There's nothing here.

658
02:25:29,350 --> 02:25:43,510
All right. Where's that sky town? I want to find it. Execute them. I don't know. The furnace of

659
02:25:43,510 --> 02:25:59,479
legend. Fire, fire, fire, fire. A lot of damage. A lot of damage. A lot of damage. A lot of damage.

660
02:25:59,479 --> 02:26:25,139
A lot of damage. I want to find the sky town. Guards, please. Where's the sky town? Is it well

661
02:26:25,139 --> 02:26:49,260
hidden? It's at 600 and 1700. I don't know what the hell that means. Oops. Well, there's F3.

662
02:26:54,170 --> 02:27:05,159
What is it? What was the coordinates? People are trying to fucking kill me.

663
02:27:05,159 --> 02:27:16,360
Oh my God. I'm on fire. I'm going to die. I'm actually going to die.

664
02:27:16,360 --> 02:27:42,549
660. And what was the other one? 7-1. 660-500. 61700. 61700. Really? I'm going to go find this

665
02:27:42,549 --> 02:27:58,819
shit. You guys went far away. Damn. 1700. That's like a fucking thousand years away.

666
02:27:58,819 --> 02:28:10,809
I think I see it. Is that it over there? All right. People are throwing grenades.

667
02:28:10,809 --> 02:28:17,620
Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. I'm coming in. Why do I not have pants on? What the fuck am I

668
02:28:17,620 --> 02:28:35,399
doing? I don't have a helmet on. Why? Stop him. Stop him. Stop him from doing that. Whoever it is.

669
02:28:35,399 --> 02:28:48,020
I'm 91. I'm dead in like fucking April. Bring in more players. Should we open it up one more time?

670
02:28:48,020 --> 02:29:09,500
I'm 91. I'm going to die in less than... I have to see the Sky Kingdom. How do I get in? How do I

671
02:29:09,500 --> 02:29:29,450
get into the Sky Kingdom? This is actually kind of cool. There's a whole little community over here.

672
02:29:29,450 --> 02:29:42,059
It's all this. Look at this. Baked Lays. The Sour Tower property of Snoozencopter and the King

673
02:29:42,059 --> 02:29:51,829
IG. Oh, it's Snoozencopter's house. What the fuck? Really? Holy shit. Baby blood's on your hands.

674
02:29:51,829 --> 02:30:04,819
Support our rightful king, Grill. Get rid of that. How did you guys do this? Get these

675
02:30:05,139 --> 02:30:19,190
burgers. Don't even think about it. Community mine. What? Holy shit. You guys have been doing

676
02:30:19,190 --> 02:30:45,559
this the whole time. Oh my god. You guys have been building this. Open the server one more time.

677
02:30:45,559 --> 02:30:55,430
Dump water down there. Look at this. This is insane. So you guys have not even have been fighting.

678
02:30:55,430 --> 02:31:00,870
You've been making a little community over here. Well, that's nice. Donate iron for buckets so we

679
02:31:00,870 --> 02:31:17,379
can eat. Here. You guys did a lot of work. Take this. I got something for you. Oh fuck. Uh oh.

680
02:31:17,379 --> 02:31:34,860
Oh shit. Uh oh. Food. Food for the... Don't even fucking... Oh my god. Get him. Don't. What is

681
02:31:34,860 --> 02:31:51,819
horse armor? Holy shit. It's like we doubled the amount of people in the server. Germa dumb and a

682
02:31:51,819 --> 02:32:04,360
stupid butt. That's funny. Where's the actual... The whitelist is fucked. Yeah, the whitelist didn't

683
02:32:04,360 --> 02:32:25,139
work the whole stream. It was a Twitch API problem and now it's zero. Now it's fucked. Kill Germa.

684
02:32:25,139 --> 02:32:47,659
Oblivion DLC? Not quite. All right. Get me in the sky tower before this stream dies.

685
02:32:47,659 --> 02:32:52,459
Everywhere you go you bring a mass murder and destruction. Leave the village. I'm sorry. I just

686
02:32:52,459 --> 02:33:10,040
couldn't see the cool things people did. My kill baby is no more here but from the truth. All right.

687
02:33:10,040 --> 02:33:32,629
My child's grave. Starved to death. Holy shit. Uh. Germa. Your mom says hi. Hi mom. If you just have

688
02:33:32,629 --> 02:33:46,780
all this stuff I don't care. We gotta give this shit. Just have it up. So am I actually... Holy

689
02:33:46,780 --> 02:34:04,170
shit. Wow. Now I know where half the server has been. Are you serious? That's awesome. What?

690
02:34:07,559 --> 02:34:21,719
Now set it on fire. No, but actually don't. I didn't reach the sky fort. No, I didn't. I don't

691
02:34:21,719 --> 02:34:50,040
even know where the sky fort is. Yeah, where is it? I saw it already. There it is. Up here.

692
02:34:50,680 --> 02:35:19,799
Just TP to it. All right. TP me to the sky fort. I want to see it. Is that it right there? That's

693
02:35:19,799 --> 02:35:43,610
it right there. Okay. Hold on. This is it. I've seen this. Dude, look at the crops. It's so fucked.

694
02:35:43,610 --> 02:36:02,649
There was a lot of weed there and it's now empty. I'm 96. I'm almost dead. I don't see anything.

695
02:36:02,649 --> 02:36:21,420
What are you talking about? Dude, weed? I don't know. What do you mean? Shoot him. Uh, I need...

696
02:36:23,100 --> 02:36:39,579
I'm 102. I'm technically dead. I'm fucking 100. I died a long painful death. Cheater.

697
02:36:40,700 --> 02:36:59,190
I have a half a heart. I'm fucked. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was cheating?

698
02:36:59,190 --> 02:37:13,180
No, I was not. Rebels be like fort. Fork runner. No killing. No stealing. No rebels. Long

699
02:37:14,299 --> 02:37:55,290
reign for 10,000 years. Is this heaven? Where the fuck am I? I have no idea where I am.

700
02:37:55,290 --> 02:38:05,559
Where am I now? Oh, people have pens of animals already. I'm dead. I died. Fuck. Did you make

701
02:38:05,559 --> 02:38:29,399
all this in two hours, two hours, two hours? And you could actually get all this done and

702
02:38:29,399 --> 02:38:42,379
nice work. Holy shit. That's very little. Well, considering how many times the server crashed,

703
02:38:42,379 --> 02:38:55,719
let me see what else you got down here. We're starving. Yeah. Not really. I want to see what's

704
02:38:55,719 --> 02:39:13,559
down here. Quarry for cobble. You guys have been busy. All the bullshit we were doing in the castle.

705
02:39:13,559 --> 02:39:29,420
You guys were playing Minecraft over here the whole time. Wow. Seriously. Nice work. Am I going

706
02:39:29,420 --> 02:39:35,750
to open up the server? Well, we're going to pull the data from and first of all, the whitelist

707
02:39:35,750 --> 02:39:40,780
didn't work. So that's another thing that there was no whitelist pretty much. This goes down

708
02:39:40,780 --> 02:39:49,000
really fucking far. We did this today to make sure that we got info of people connecting to the

709
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:56,090
server. We're going to save it the way it is and we're going to do this again. Don't tell anybody

710
02:39:56,090 --> 02:40:05,989
there's anything down here, but look what's down here. There was only one way we could test anything

711
02:40:05,989 --> 02:40:26,040
that was doing it. That's the only way. This is huge by the way. Breaking with bread. So this was

712
02:40:26,040 --> 02:40:37,909
actually probably the reals versus yesterday and the day before. So what, what was our max amount

713
02:40:37,909 --> 02:40:55,110
of people in the server? 200, 400, 300, 200 something. So now we know for next time what we

714
02:40:55,110 --> 02:41:13,350
can do. Uh, yeah, just take email. Discord Mike. It should be 2000. Well, that's a lot harder than

715
02:41:13,350 --> 02:41:25,059
it looks because getting even two or 300 people in the same server is insane. It's only 108. Somebody

716
02:41:25,059 --> 02:41:48,739
just kill them. Don't worry. I'll take care. Just play RuneScape instead. I'm jumping off a building.

717
02:42:00,139 --> 02:42:08,889
Sunset. So what a beautiful do what? Well, some of you did a great community here.

718
02:42:08,889 --> 02:42:18,309
Hide and the server crashed like 10 times. So we got what we needed for data. Thanks for

719
02:42:18,309 --> 02:42:24,549
participating because this is probably what we're going to call it. So if we do this again,

720
02:42:24,549 --> 02:42:29,540
we're going to make sure that we have the whitelisting in place next time. We were like 10

721
02:42:29,540 --> 02:42:34,969
minutes away from, but I was like, no, fuck it. Let's just do it. Who cares? I didn't even give

722
02:42:34,969 --> 02:42:58,889
a shit. How did us, how did you, a spider get into kingdom? Yeah. I think we learned a lot from this

723
02:42:58,889 --> 02:43:11,319
stream. So that's good. So I will see you guys tomorrow. We're going to, we're going to pull as

724
02:43:11,319 --> 02:43:15,959
much as we can from this and try to see this as like another stress test, essentially.

725
02:43:27,379 --> 02:43:39,260
The microphone. We'll figure it. Did I name the kingdom? I didn't even name the kingdom. It's

726
02:43:39,260 --> 02:43:50,569
called no. Yeah, I did. We're going to save everything that's here now. And next time we're

727
02:43:50,569 --> 02:43:55,610
going to try four different things. I want to do this at least one more time and then hopefully

728
02:43:55,610 --> 02:44:09,500
we can have, why am I getting attacked by, stop attacking me. What's going on? Prove it's not

729
02:44:09,500 --> 02:44:18,420
creative. I'm dying right now. I'm being literally killed right now. I'm dead. Don't cheat. I'm not

730
02:44:18,420 --> 02:44:40,739
cheating. Next time. No cheating. I get to still be 108 years old, but you still owe me for crashing

731
02:44:40,739 --> 02:44:50,809
my jet pack and GTA castle. Oh, the server's dead. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That'll be it for tonight.

732
02:44:53,530 --> 02:44:59,219
Uh, those of you that got to participate, uh, we were minutes away from canceling the stream,

733
02:44:59,860 --> 02:45:06,440
but thanks for stress testing this and putting this in a, uh, in a position where we can figure

734
02:45:06,440 --> 02:45:15,879
out things we can do to put in place to make it a little bit. Yeah. If you want to, here's the

735
02:45:15,879 --> 02:45:24,840
people that are literally sitting trying to make this whole thing work. I had fun at least for the

736
02:45:24,840 --> 02:45:37,299
first couple hours. Let's see if we can get some more bugs ironed out and let's try this again.

737
02:45:37,299 --> 02:45:44,709
But I'll see you guys tomorrow. Tomorrow afternoon. Thanks for participating in the

738
02:45:44,709 --> 02:45:54,659
experiment in the stress test. We'll see what we can do with it next week. Fix Mike tomorrow.

739
02:45:54,659 --> 02:46:01,159
Don't worry. Mike's going to be back to normal. Good night guys. Thank you again.

740
02:46:02,040 --> 02:46:14,360
Sorry for the late start. See you tomorrow. The bits and the subs. I will do those tomorrow

741
02:46:14,360 --> 02:46:19,579
because I'm not. So I don't have access to the information, right? We'll go with the bits and

742
02:46:19,579 --> 02:46:26,180
subs tomorrow. Tomorrow after the stream. I'm not currently live from my own home.

743
02:46:27,770 --> 02:46:37,819
We're at a mobile studio right now. Nerf the guards.

744
02:46:40,620 --> 02:46:44,139
I told you we were going to have to do like a test of this to see how it worked out.

745
02:46:45,899 --> 02:46:52,120
I still had fun. I thought it was fucking funny. The mod should wear chain mail. Yeah.

746
02:46:52,920 --> 02:46:57,270
We'll do that next time. Good night though. We'll see you tomorrow.

747
02:46:58,649 --> 02:47:01,610
Thanks for participating. See you soon. Take care.
