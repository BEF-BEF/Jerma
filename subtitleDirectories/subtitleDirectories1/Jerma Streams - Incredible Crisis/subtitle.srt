00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:09,429
Guys, it's very easy to be early when the stream starts normally four hours ago.

2
00:00:09,429 --> 00:00:12,949
It's easy to be early when you're four hours late.

3
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,370
How are you guys doing? Doing well? Hope your day's going well.

4
00:00:23,929 --> 00:00:34,070
My day's going real well. I got out of physical therapy.

5
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:44,439
Got some info. I'm a little tight. It's all right. We did a nice consultation.

6
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:48,039
Find out what we're gonna do going forward. Now I'm gonna go two plus days a week.

7
00:00:49,219 --> 00:01:03,210
Let's go. Today, we're gonna be playing Incredible Crisis for the PlayStation 1.

8
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:08,790
The reason why we're gonna do this is because this game is a short,

9
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,219
albeit incredibly interesting experience from what I've told.

10
00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:22,099
It's kind of a rhythm game, but not... I think the whole game is just fucking weird.

11
00:01:22,099 --> 00:01:29,859
Because we're starting so late, this stream is gonna be only probably a few hours long,

12
00:01:29,859 --> 00:01:35,319
so we don't go until like 12, 1 a.m. Pacific, and we'll be back tomorrow.

13
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,319
I did want to get something in here. I didn't want to just not stream today.

14
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:48,090
I wanted to stream because I like streaming. I like streaming. Quick, do a funny grandma voice.

15
00:01:50,810 --> 00:02:01,859
That was perfect for what you're asking me to do. We got a wink.

16
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:09,000
That was a left funny grandma voice. I can do a funny grandma voice,

17
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,699
but that's not what you asked me to do. I had specific instructions. Wink for us already.

18
00:02:16,699 --> 00:02:21,740
Hold on a second. I'm getting there. Just wait. Let's wait. Let people trickle in.

19
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:31,460
Hurry up. You're a con artist. Hold on. I'm doing fine.

20
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:36,460
But you didn't ask me how I was doing. Hurry up. How was your day? I'm doing good.

21
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:42,789
All right. You want me to quell this whole thing for you? Do you care more about wink

22
00:02:43,349 --> 00:03:10,009
or do you care more about dog on screen? It's me being like, chewing on my tongue.

23
00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:18,810
We're getting angry. I tell you, this thing's gonna get me in trouble.

24
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:37,139
I was like, more blink than wink. Hold on. I got you. Hold on. There. Use it. Print it.

25
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:48,069
Edit it. All right. You guys ready? I want to say, what's the MOBA? What's the MOBA that they made

26
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:52,229
and they patched it like 10 times and it got to a point where it was 1.0 and then they closed it?

27
00:03:56,169 --> 00:04:02,009
Incredible Crisis. What was Infinite Crisis? Yes, that's the one.

28
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,909
Yes. Infinite Crisis is the game that got into 1.0 finally and then they closed the servers.

29
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:13,860
The family guy online. What the heck? What are you talking about?

30
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:23,930
All right. You guys ready? You can make a move around. This is awesome.

31
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:45,050
Here comes Incredible Crisis against the dog bones. Presents what? They present, but like

32
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:58,490
it's developed by Polygon Magic. Music by Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra. This is on PlayStation 1,

33
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:09,269
by the way. Is there a voiceover or anything? Please have a face. Two moons when I was Earth.

34
00:05:09,269 --> 00:05:45,509
Here comes the ant. You all know it's my birthday today. What? Birthday? Yeah, that's right.

35
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:55,800
I'll make your favorite dinner. It really is that family. It's 3D movie making. Not again.

36
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:01,480
It's the same family. Not again. Of course. Brad movie's free. That's my reason for living.

37
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:15,879
Happy birthday, grandma. I want everyone home early today. Who just opened that?

38
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:26,620
Who just closed that? Take an ice cream. Michael got old. Story of Taneo chapter 1. Goodbye. I

39
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:41,129
missed it. Whatever it said. Where's this? Okay. What are they doing with another Earth?

40
00:06:47,930 --> 00:07:07,689
Daydreaming? Time to exercise. Wait, the office is. I mean time to. Taneo dance fever. Okay. Okay.

41
00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:11,769
Hold on. Okay, everybody. Let's do some exercise to relieve the day's stress.

42
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:18,939
Let's dance. Press buttons and direction buttons as shown. Make a mistake. You're

43
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:23,819
fired. Your skill level goes down. Perfect dance. Your skill level goes up. This

44
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:48,410
game cannot be paused. Push what? Push what? What is that? Oh, what was that wrong? I did it wrong.

45
00:07:49,050 --> 00:08:01,259
That's good, Taneo. Good job. This is why it takes so long for somebody at Comcast to answer

46
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:21,430
the phone. Is this what people do at the office? Holy shit. Hang in there, Taneo. How am I doing

47
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:44,679
this wrong? What? You're doing great. What's on your resume? You know, I got my master's in

48
00:08:44,679 --> 00:09:04,019
business engineering. I sold brick. What? I already love this game. Okay, now I'm killing it.

49
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:16,100
All right, so when does the trap door open underneath the person that did the worst?

50
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:39,580
You've pleased me. Back to work. Hey, well, that was fun. They do this every day. What? What the

51
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:59,500
fuck? Holy shit. Bowling inferno? What? I thought we were dancing. Avoid the iron ball. In the

52
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:06,139
distance, meter turns red. Run with X. Make sure you have enough energy drink. When running, use up

53
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:15,909
and down directional buttons to avoid obstacles. What? I'm going to be being followed by a ball?

54
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:28,419
Wait, what do I have to do? I'm tapping, right? I'm tapping. I'm tapping. How much do I have to

55
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:58,730
tap? I didn't... Avoid the iron ball. If the distance meter turns red, run with X button.

56
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:18,220
So don't do anything until it's red. Okay, let's go. I have to have enough energy drink.

57
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:25,190
All right, I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. Oh shit, I have to pay attention to that too.

58
00:11:26,149 --> 00:11:37,299
All right, we're good. All right, same deal. Oh, fuck. It's going to hit me. All right, we're good.

59
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:59,220
Got it. That was interesting. Elevator of doom. First try. I made it. Phew.

60
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:11,159
Wouldn't the... Is it going to open and the ball's going to be there? Excellent. Is this an emulator?

61
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:25,110
No. Oh, it's like trying to get me. It's following me around. Why is it doing this? Stop the elevator.

62
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:30,490
Break it with X button. Stop it before the counter hits zero. Use directional buttons to avoid

63
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:38,360
falling objects. Blue meter indicates breaking power. I'm confused. Stop when it gets to zero.

64
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:58,220
Use directional button. Oh, okay. I get it. Stop it at zero? Mash A? Wait, stop it now?

65
00:12:59,259 --> 00:13:16,809
Who's dropping bots and fans at me? The people have thrown rocks at me. I can't laugh. Hold on.

66
00:13:16,809 --> 00:13:25,830
I can't laugh and play this. Oh, it's too many. Hold on. I got to get the... Hold on. I know what

67
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:50,169
to do now. Okay. There's a lot going on. Stop it. Break it with X. Stop it before it hits zero.

68
00:13:50,169 --> 00:13:57,259
When it hits zero. This is not a superhero movie. Okay. Here we go. I'll get this right now. You

69
00:13:57,259 --> 00:14:22,659
ready? Why is it not registering these? I'm doing it too fast again. There we go. I'm literally

70
00:14:22,659 --> 00:14:36,090
pressing it too fast for it to register. I was going like... Like, you know, I can do it if the

71
00:14:36,090 --> 00:15:11,909
game wouldn't register it. Am I dead? Again? We don't want to register this shit. It's still

72
00:15:11,909 --> 00:15:35,700
following me. It's still trying to kill me. What the fuck is going on, man? Am I going to be all

73
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:56,679
right? Nerd. Nerd. Nerd on a wire? Okay. Now what? Cross to safety. Press and hold X button to move

74
00:15:56,679 --> 00:16:01,399
towards the green zone. If you lose balance, recover with directional buttons. Pull will snap

75
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:21,379
when the time is up. What? I'm already gone. Oh, I get it. Okay. 40 milliseconds? 50 milliseconds?

76
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:35,779
What's this milliseconds? What? Get in the middle. All right. I'm good. Oh, God damn it. I try. You

77
00:16:35,779 --> 00:16:42,700
have to hold... Oh, fuck. It's going to happen again. Okay. Fine. I'm fine. It's the Tony Hawk

78
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:52,309
manual. Except sideways. We're good. I feel like I'm letting that go when it's supposed to.

79
00:16:54,919 --> 00:17:08,410
Don't get over it. This thing's going to snap, isn't it? Now what? What the fuck? He's trying...

80
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:13,450
He's holding. He's trying to hold it. Come on. Hold it for like another one more time.

81
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:30,839
That's a lot harder than it looks. Trust me. Trust me. I'm really good at Tiger Woods golf.

82
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:46,180
Holy shit. Okay. That's harder than you think it is. Guys, I get a perfect drive in Tiger Woods

83
00:17:46,180 --> 00:18:04,059
every time. Trust me. This is much harder than you think it is. Am I good? Hey, no. What? Is there

84
00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:16,819
gust of wind? I'm fucking trying. I didn't get it once. No, I didn't because it's really weird.

85
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:24,200
It's either too much or too little. This game's running... It's like 20 FPS. I'm not getting all

86
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:45,559
the exact frames that I need. All right. We're good. Nope. Look at that mocap acting. All right.

87
00:18:45,559 --> 00:19:04,119
That was pretty cool. All right. That was... Oh no. I got an A in bowling, an A in dancing,

88
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:20,549
and a C in an elevator, and a D on nerd on a wire. That's not good. Oh, this is a PlayStation 2

89
00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:28,920
memory card. Right. My PS1... I don't know where it is. This game's like three hours long. Don't

90
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:38,230
worry. We're going to beat it. Story of Teneo Chapter 2. Five seconds to what?

91
00:19:51,160 --> 00:20:07,319
I'll check it. Paramedics, the A team. Hold on. Just answer the questions. Press X for yes or

92
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:12,759
O for no. 10 correct answers are needed to clear the stage. Two wrong answers in a row will trigger

93
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:24,710
an electric shock. Hey, listen closely. Is 47,326 an even number? Yeah. What? Yes. What?

94
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:32,230
Hey, are you okay? Did Nightingale take an active role during World War II? What? You have to give

95
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:40,279
a heart massage. Hey, I can't read the text. Is one centimeter 10 millimeters? No, it's not. What?

96
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:46,519
I pressed no. Are you still alive? Is one kilometer 100,000 millimeters? No. What?

97
00:20:48,569 --> 00:20:52,490
I'm pressing the right buttons. Wait. X is yes, right? X is yes?

98
00:20:53,619 --> 00:21:00,099
Four play by six people per team. Yeah. Okay. I got it. I got it backwards. X is no. Oh my

99
00:21:00,099 --> 00:21:05,380
fucking God. I thought X was yes. Okay. I got it wrong. X is, I thought X was yes. X is no.

100
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:21,369
No. Press X for yes. I had it right. What? X is yes. You got, you're freaking me out. I live in

101
00:21:21,369 --> 00:21:26,890
America. I'm an American. When they start asking me about like 10,000 milliliters, I'm going to

102
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:35,740
get it wrong. Okay. Here we go. Is Maine the northernmost state in the U.S.? It's not. I

103
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:43,210
saw, I thought it was. Listen. What is it? Michigan? Is 21 an even number? No. He's American.

104
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:53,259
Is soccer played by 11 people per team? Yes. Are the reindeer pulling Santa's sleigh all female?

105
00:21:53,259 --> 00:22:09,240
No. No. No. I'm okay. Is soccer played by 15 people per team? No. You just asked me,

106
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,559
that's the question. Is four hundred and three hundred times two? No. Um, I don't know.

107
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:19,400
There's two. I couldn't do it. Can you hear me? Is 30,000 equals five? I don't know. Yes.

108
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:27,180
I don't know. I can't read the fucking numbers. Is 218 times 2576? No. I don't know. I don't know.

109
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:37,700
I don't know. Is basketball a sport played by five people per team? Yes. Is one times one two? No.

110
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:48,630
Can you hear me? Is 68 times nine 610? I don't know. No. I can't do that. I seriously can't do

111
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:59,319
the writing in two seconds. What? How many hoes are there? Ten. I don't know. Point A is three to

112
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:06,039
be north of the tower. Point B is one to be north of the tower. Is point A five meters south of point

113
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:16,470
zero D? No. I'm dead. I'm still alive. Is one plus one, that's one two three four five six seven

114
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:30,500
eight nine ten eleven twelve. Shit. I thought, I thought they were going to throw something in

115
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:35,940
the end where it was like is one plus one plus one plus one plus two plus three minus ten ten.

116
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:48,970
You know what I mean? I thought they were going to do a minus on me. Is Maine? No. I already know

117
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:52,890
this because I've, guys, I've died three times. I can come back to life and get the same questions.

118
00:23:52,890 --> 00:24:01,690
We rewind. Is the currency of Japan yen? Yes. Hey, you're still alive. Is California the western

119
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:05,450
most state in the U.S.? No, it's not. No, it's not. It's probably, I think it's Washington.

120
00:24:06,009 --> 00:24:13,849
Or Alaska. Is basketball or sport played by five people? Yes. Or Hawaii. Hawaii. Hawaii is all the

121
00:24:13,849 --> 00:24:27,099
way over there. Are the reindeer pulling this leg all female? No. By the way, yes. I don't know. Hey,

122
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:32,859
you okay? Is soccer played by 11 people per team? Oh, I don't, I don't watch soccer. I've never

123
00:24:32,859 --> 00:24:43,400
watched one full game in my entire life. It's 96. Yes. Hey, are you okay? An even number. No.

124
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:54,089
You hear me? I have no idea. I would need, I would need to write that down and do long division.

125
00:24:54,970 --> 00:25:02,180
It's 300 north of power and point B, one of east. I don't fucking, I can't even read the question.

126
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:16,789
I gotta get these right. Point A is, is point, fuck. West of B and D is 200. Is the west tower,

127
00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:31,480
is the tower? I can't read that fast. I can't even read. No, yes it is. No, it's not. I'm dead.

128
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:42,759
I'm gonna lose again. Point A is, it's point A, point A at point. I'm gonna suck her for a while.

129
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:51,099
What's it, what's it? One plus one plus one. Is that, no, what's, no, no, no, no, no. What, what is,

130
00:25:51,099 --> 00:25:54,779
was that a two? I couldn't, it's a, it's like the blurry fucking line. I can't even read it.

131
00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:10,519
Just do it again. Start over. I thought it was a plus. No, it's not. No, they're not. No,

132
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,720
they're not. Oh my god. Oh my god, I hate this one. They keep changing the questions.

133
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:20,200
I think I haven't memorized, but they haven't, fuck it, they changed it a little bit.

134
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:26,940
I think I haven't memorized. No, they're not all female. It just said are they all male. I thought

135
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:36,099
it was the same question and that's why I didn't read the other. Yes, it's yen. Is the currency of

136
00:26:36,099 --> 00:27:03,670
Japan? No. Yes. Hey, can you hear me? No. Three, no, no. It's 100 minutes past 11,

137
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:11,500
15, 12, 15. What? What do you mean, what are you talking about? 100, no, it's not. Is the tower,

138
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:24,380
Haidotokyo tower 330, what, how am I supposed to know how tall the tower is? What is that?

139
00:27:25,339 --> 00:27:31,349
How many sets is it? Oh, it's incentive. I don't know. There could be a small miniature tower in

140
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:37,430
Tokyo. That could be like a small welcome to like the miniature tiny Tokyo tower. I don't know

141
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:44,180
what's going on. I've never been there. Oh shit. Oh shit. I got to do that again. I can do the

142
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:50,539
whole thing again. All right, hold on. I can blow, I can do this one very easily, but I need to get

143
00:27:50,539 --> 00:28:16,200
that memory card right now. Oh shit. Shit. Why is he being here? He's Yorika. This game, no.

144
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:25,750
Tokyo tower is? How do I know it could be? It's under a lot of stress. They can electrocute me.

145
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:36,119
Just when they think, I think I got the answer. All right, let me check this. Make sure it's

146
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:40,119
actually going to read this. Me and my friend beat this with no memory cards.

147
00:28:42,539 --> 00:29:00,220
I don't care. I'm going to use one. What the fuck, dude? Easy. Oh, we had big bits come in.

148
00:29:02,579 --> 00:29:08,579
I know how these ones work now though. Don't you'll see. You'll see. I'm interested though.

149
00:29:08,579 --> 00:29:25,180
Now you got me interested. A phylactery lich gave $55, 5550 bits. Hey, Jerma, I bought the ring.

150
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:30,220
I'm going to use to propose to my girlfriend today and it's in part thanks to you. Thanks for

151
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:34,460
always putting on a good show and keeping us laughing. You're our special boy. Another marriage.

152
00:29:35,339 --> 00:29:50,039
Another marriage proposal. That's two in a row. Oh, congratulations on the proposal, right? Hope

153
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:56,170
it goes well for you. Hope you guys are happy. And I'm not going to say anything to potentially

154
00:29:56,170 --> 00:30:06,339
ruin it because that's what happened yesterday. Thanks for the huge amount of money. I'm happy to

155
00:30:06,339 --> 00:30:10,660
be your special boy. Well, no, no, that's weird. That's kind of weird to say out loud.

156
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:14,740
All right, here we go. Dance fever. I'm going to get, I'm going to get A's on all this.

157
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:30,170
Let's do some exercising. Yup. Yup. Yup. Yup. Yup. Fuck. Oh, did they change the song too?

158
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:59,289
Or is it the same? Good job. Can you please ask my wife to marry me? Well, I do like that you can't

159
00:30:59,289 --> 00:31:06,339
pause these. It makes it more interesting. I'm Han Solo.

160
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:44,039
Impressing those at the right time. The dude on the right looks like Jerma.

161
00:31:44,759 --> 00:32:04,650
Pretty cool suit. No, I don't. I need to get a new suit. What color? What should I get for a suit?

162
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:18,980
What color should I get? Should I get like a pink suit? No, no, no, no. Yellow? Wait, what's

163
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:25,880
someone in Dumb and Dumber? Pinstripe? I don't know. I don't know if I would. Pinstripe would

164
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:43,339
work here. I would, I would, a light. No, you just, I have people saying that because of the

165
00:32:43,339 --> 00:33:01,369
Joker. I get it. Um, I'd like light purple maybe. Red or green? Just trying to get to grandma's.

166
00:33:01,369 --> 00:33:24,500
That's all I care about. Turn the brightness down. You think so? Too bright? Is it too bright?

167
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:43,509
Maybe a little? Well, we'll take a look. We'll see. What do you think about this? Better? Look a

168
00:33:43,509 --> 00:34:02,650
little better? Oh, this part. This part kind of sucks. Here we go. Take it nice and easy. I know

169
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:30,730
how to play it. Fucking TV. Look out. Turn off the pixels. Uh, I can't do that because this is a

170
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:53,179
video game that was developed in 2002 or something. Cover that TV. All right. That was much cleaner

171
00:34:53,179 --> 00:35:07,210
than last time. I'm much happier with the outcome on this one. Do it. Come on. Do the line.

172
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:23,239
Get me back in that ambulance. Get these questions right. Oh no, I forgot. I have to do nerd on a

173
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:33,849
wire. Shit. All right. Let me try to get this at least once. I can't get a D on every single one

174
00:35:33,849 --> 00:35:43,320
of these. Here we go. Dude, I'm telling you, this is fucking hard. It's, it's very, it's got to be

175
00:35:43,320 --> 00:36:00,949
that. It's hard. Get in there. Finally. All right. Got it. It went faster that time. It

176
00:36:00,949 --> 00:36:24,789
fucks with you. Shit. Come on. All right. It's going to be faster. Yep. It's faster again.

177
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:46,969
Come on. Hit. Oh, good recovery. Immediate recovery. Oh my God. That's hard. I can't imagine

178
00:36:47,050 --> 00:37:04,539
getting that every time. Whoa. Oh my God. You can do it. I know you can. I know you're capable

179
00:37:04,539 --> 00:37:11,349
of it. There you are. Here we go. Okay. Would it be easier just to, yeah, these are just wrap

180
00:37:11,349 --> 00:37:18,820
around the thing and shimmy up. All right. It's time to save the game and let's get back in that

181
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:27,179
ambulance. In Alaska, the Western most state. What is the Western most state then? Why for

182
00:37:27,659 --> 00:37:33,219
a lot? Is it how it's Alaska? No. So what is it? Why? How far over is Hawaii?

183
00:37:43,429 --> 00:38:01,769
Like data data one. All right. Here we go. Five seconds. I'm going to get this. I will do this.

184
00:38:01,769 --> 00:38:13,349
That doesn't matter. It takes me three hours. Why is also East? That's what I mean. They,

185
00:38:13,349 --> 00:38:17,750
that muck ass, you know, it could be it's East and West. It's the East most and West most state

186
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:34,710
potentially. Right. It's one kilometer, 10,000 liters. No, it's not liters. I couldn't even

187
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:43,219
get it's hard to read. It's California. The Western most state. No, it's one centimeter,

188
00:38:43,219 --> 00:38:54,090
10 millimeters. It's not no 10 centimeters is one. No, an odd number. Did it say liters again?

189
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:59,530
I get hard to read. I thought of millimeters. Yes. It said milliliters.

190
00:39:00,329 --> 00:39:16,309
Is soccer played by 15 people? No, it's 11. It's 8, 57 times 9, 7. No. Yes.

191
00:39:16,869 --> 00:39:24,789
We got a wink. I know. Hold on. I don't, I have no idea. How the fuck am I supposed to know?

192
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:38,280
Hold on. That's a lot of subs. That's a lot of subs. Harrow is heavier than Hanoka.

193
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:42,280
Pierre is heavier than Harrow. Hanoka is, is Pierre heavier than? Yes.

194
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:50,760
Yes. Uh, Freddie Dredd. Freddie. Freddie. Hold on. No, Freddie. Freddie, did you go to,

195
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:58,280
did you go to Hash House or Go-Go? It's 93, 60 times 21. Not. Yes. I'm alive. I'm alive.

196
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:05,940
A hundred community subs from Freddie Dredd. Did you go to Hash House or Go-Go? And was it

197
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:09,829
your favorite restaurant you've ever been to in your whole life? Thanks for the fucking

198
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:26,760
100 community subs, Freddie. That's ridiculous. Insane. I, I, I need confirmation of that because

199
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:33,289
you said you were going. Well, we didn't get the verdict. Ride the stretcher. Use left and

200
00:40:33,289 --> 00:40:37,929
right directional buttons to steer. Avoid cars and motorbikes. If you hit construction signs,

201
00:40:37,929 --> 00:40:41,610
you'll lose control. For a while you're done when the distance meter reaches zero.

202
00:40:42,489 --> 00:40:48,659
All right. Don't hit any cars.

203
00:40:48,659 --> 00:41:11,480
All right. Why does his voice get lower? Can I jump? Is there a jump? Jesus. Why are they on

204
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:30,440
this? I have a long way to go. Come on. Stay good. Stay good. Oh my God. How many times

205
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:44,570
am I going to get a hit? I can't. All right. Settle down. Settle down.

206
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:58,280
I'm not, I'm not doing this. I hit one and it fucked up forever. I'm not pressing these buttons.

207
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:34,280
Now I can press. Dude, how have I not failed? I can't. I just read the funniest comment.

208
00:42:35,159 --> 00:42:39,239
I just read it. And it's going to stick with me for like two weeks.

209
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:46,360
Somebody said, why? What's with the America's funniest home video music?

210
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:08,519
Or any show on Animal Planet? Oh, God damn it. That was fucking funny. Oh,

211
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:27,480
look at me. Oh, Freddy. Freddy says something again. I went twice. I got the blue cheese burger

212
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:32,039
the first time. It was great. And then the chicken and waffles the next time. My girlfriend loved it

213
00:43:32,039 --> 00:43:36,360
as well. Thank you for that wonderful suggestion. I didn't get to see Betty White's slot machine

214
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:42,550
though. Unfortunate. Unfortunate, but that place is awesome. I'm glad they took care of you.

215
00:43:46,809 --> 00:43:59,639
Wait, what? Don't I have a wife? Wait, am I going to like, Taneo? That's not, Taneo, what the fuck

216
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:11,130
are you doing, man? What? Did we just go? Love fireworks and Ferris wheel. He just waved at the

217
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:19,340
stream. Hold on. Find the pressure points. The lady wants a back massage. She will guide you.

218
00:44:20,059 --> 00:44:27,059
Find the points with X. Press X repeatedly to fill up the massage meter.

219
00:44:34,059 --> 00:44:43,110
Okay, I don't. What? What does that mean? I don't know what that means.

220
00:44:43,110 --> 00:45:06,139
Oh, God damn it. Fuck. Okay. I get to put on like fucking animal planet music again.

221
00:45:11,579 --> 00:45:22,230
Okay. All right. All right. All right. So that's not what you think it is. That's like a remix of

222
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:54,329
a famous song. I just don't want it to tone. Hold on. I don't want to turn it off. Just wait,

223
00:45:54,329 --> 00:45:57,610
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'll do it with all the audio. You don't need to hear this.

224
00:45:57,610 --> 00:46:30,500
I'll pass you bedtime anyways, you kids. Okay. What? Okay. I'm going to get Twitch arrested if

225
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:50,699
I keep doing this. Okay. Hold on. I don't. Okay. Oh, God damn it. All right. I'm going to get

226
00:46:50,699 --> 00:46:59,690
through this. Let's get through this. I'll get through this. Yeah, I got to get some fucking

227
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:10,019
background music to make sure like people, whatever.

228
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:24,780
You don't need to hear anything.

229
00:47:37,880 --> 00:48:01,130
This is uncomfortable. This is uncomfortable. Is the song still going? I can't even hear it.

230
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:43,829
I can't. Is it still going? I have no audio. I have to do it. Dun dun dun. Okay. I'm glad this

231
00:48:43,829 --> 00:48:47,670
is muted because this is a lot of, this is a lot of fucked up stuff going on right now.

232
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:59,780
The other one. This is the new one.

233
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:24,809
I didn't play the new one. Make it stop. I'm trying.

234
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:33,349
All right. Let's go. Anybody in the chat, over the age of 18, stay.

235
00:49:35,989 --> 00:49:38,469
She's happy that there's a back massage going on.

236
00:49:38,469 --> 00:50:08,599
This is not the way I'm going out. This is not the way I'm going out on

237
00:50:08,599 --> 00:50:17,769
Twitch. This is not the way I'm going out on Twitch. This ain't the way I'm going out on Twitch.

238
00:50:18,489 --> 00:50:44,579
No. Not going to happen. Let's get to that.

239
00:50:44,579 --> 00:50:47,579
This is a strange of things.

240
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:57,360
This is too hard.

241
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:00,300
I'm gonna fucking pee my pants.

242
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:08,670
Alright, come on.

243
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:16,710
Oh my god, man, this is so hard.

244
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,480
Do you understand how hard this is?

245
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:27,480
Look, this is fucking impossible.

246
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,480
This is impossible.

247
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:36,880
Alright, no, no, no, no.

248
00:51:39,619 --> 00:51:41,619
Fucking god, I can't un-

249
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:55,099
What is this?

250
00:51:55,099 --> 00:51:56,099
Stranger Things-

251
00:51:56,099 --> 00:51:58,099
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.

252
00:51:58,099 --> 00:51:59,099
Is this like fucking spoilers?

253
00:51:59,099 --> 00:52:13,110
I just saw season three fucking tease, and I just had to-

254
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:14,110
I can't hear what's happening.

255
00:52:14,110 --> 00:52:16,110
I don't have audio for my desktop.

256
00:52:16,110 --> 00:52:19,110
I saw season three tease, and I'm like, oh fuck, is it like-

257
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:21,110
Are they talking about the season three?

258
00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:23,630
God almighty.

259
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:27,980
No, I don't want any more Stranger Things.

260
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:31,980
The boys of Stranger Things on fucking like Conan O'Brien.

261
00:52:33,219 --> 00:52:34,219
Get this off.

262
00:52:34,219 --> 00:52:52,210
Come on, I have to get this.

263
00:52:52,210 --> 00:53:03,369
Why?

264
00:53:03,369 --> 00:53:07,269
Why is it on this?

265
00:53:07,269 --> 00:53:15,420
I just went- I went and hit the back button like six times.

266
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:18,420
Why is it on Stranger Things announcements?

267
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:43,579
I'm paying attention to the game, and I look over at chat, and I see-

268
00:53:43,579 --> 00:53:46,579
Fucking change it, dude, change it.

269
00:53:46,579 --> 00:53:49,679
I'm gonna lose my mind.

270
00:53:49,679 --> 00:54:03,380
I got it, this is gonna be it.

271
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:11,949
Oh my fucking god.

272
00:54:11,949 --> 00:54:33,139
Oh my god, man.

273
00:54:33,139 --> 00:54:43,340
Okay, I got it, this is gonna be it.

274
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:47,840
Done.

275
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:48,840
Okay, we'll be back.

276
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:54,110
Alright.

277
00:54:54,110 --> 00:54:55,110
Jesus Christ.

278
00:54:55,110 --> 00:54:57,570
I can't believe my fucking legs.

279
00:54:57,570 --> 00:54:58,570
Did I?

280
00:54:58,570 --> 00:54:59,570
Alright, be real with me.

281
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:02,809
Did I like spoil fucking strange things like all three seasons?

282
00:55:02,809 --> 00:55:03,809
Did I?

283
00:55:03,809 --> 00:55:04,809
Like, I hope I didn't.

284
00:55:04,809 --> 00:55:05,809
Did that actually happen?

285
00:55:05,809 --> 00:55:09,539
No?

286
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:10,539
No, did I?

287
00:55:10,539 --> 00:55:12,679
Yes?

288
00:55:12,679 --> 00:55:14,110
No?

289
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:15,110
No, did I?

290
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:16,110
No, seriously?

291
00:55:16,110 --> 00:55:17,110
Don't fucking tell me that.

292
00:55:17,110 --> 00:55:26,320
How do we get from America's Funniest Home Videos theme to Stranger Things announcements

293
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:29,860
to-

294
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:30,860
You played music.

295
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:36,710
Oh.

296
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:37,710
Why did she leave a bomb with me?

297
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:47,440
I only got a C.

298
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:50,829
God damn it.

299
00:55:52,329 --> 00:55:57,940
Dirty old man.

300
00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:04,619
For that one to be under review.

301
00:56:04,619 --> 00:56:07,619
We had $50 come in.

302
00:56:07,619 --> 00:56:12,889
Twice.

303
00:56:12,889 --> 00:56:16,889
One from Vimthral and one from DesoidCatchfuck.

304
00:56:16,889 --> 00:56:20,750
You got an A.

305
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:23,309
Do you permit override?

306
00:56:23,309 --> 00:56:24,489
Yes.

307
00:56:24,489 --> 00:56:26,489
Vimthral, thanks for the 5000 bits.

308
00:56:26,489 --> 00:56:28,489
Fat bits for a very funny man.

309
00:56:28,489 --> 00:56:31,489
Please read this as it's important and this person needs to hear it.

310
00:56:31,489 --> 00:56:35,219
Okay.

311
00:56:35,219 --> 00:56:37,219
If you're out there.

312
00:56:38,219 --> 00:56:41,460
Ignis Scientia.

313
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:45,460
Please let me put your beautiful aqua line nose in my mouth.

314
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:46,460
What is that?

315
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:48,920
What is that?

316
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:53,400
What did I just do?

317
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:57,400
Also, chat, you better be making the away noises each time Teniro makes them in the

318
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:01,519
game.

319
00:57:01,519 --> 00:57:02,519
Thanks for the huge amount of money.

320
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:05,210
It's a Final Fantasy character.

321
00:57:05,210 --> 00:57:09,159
Now what the fuck is going on?

322
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:15,369
What is going on in this game?

323
00:57:15,369 --> 00:57:17,610
Thank you, Vimthral.

324
00:57:17,610 --> 00:57:19,909
Independence Debate?

325
00:57:19,909 --> 00:57:24,460
Independence 3A?

326
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:25,460
Hello?

327
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:26,460
Oh, Rurika.

328
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:27,460
It's me, Dad.

329
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:28,460
Don't let them attack.

330
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:29,460
That's the...

331
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:30,460
What are you all talking about?

332
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:31,460
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

333
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:33,820
That's the what?

334
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:34,820
That's terrible.

335
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:40,929
Okay.

336
00:57:40,929 --> 00:57:44,880
Protect the UFO.

337
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,880
But first, I want to say thank you to, uh, Desoid.

338
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:49,880
Another $5000.

339
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:51,880
It's 5000 bits.

340
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:54,119
5000 bit currency dollars.

341
00:57:54,119 --> 00:57:56,119
Uh, thanks for the 50 bucks.

342
00:57:56,119 --> 00:58:00,679
It's my birthday today and I had to go to three important meetings.

343
00:58:00,679 --> 00:58:02,679
It's the hardest I've laughed today.

344
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:06,010
Thanks for making today a little less stressful.

345
00:58:06,010 --> 00:58:07,010
Yeah.

346
00:58:07,010 --> 00:58:08,010
Absolutely.

347
00:58:08,010 --> 00:58:09,010
Thank you.

348
00:58:09,010 --> 00:58:10,010
Thanks for the 5000 bits.

349
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:11,179
Thanks for sticking around.

350
00:58:11,179 --> 00:58:13,380
Hope your meetings went well.

351
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:15,380
Alright, so shoot down the missiles attacking the UFO.

352
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:18,940
Directional buttons to aim and X to shoot.

353
00:58:24,489 --> 00:58:26,489
Why are we siding with the aliens?

354
00:58:26,489 --> 00:58:29,579
Again?

355
00:58:29,579 --> 00:58:31,019
Why, why does it...

356
00:58:31,019 --> 00:58:40,940
Did I shoot the planes?

357
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:54,909
Someone's there.

358
00:58:54,909 --> 00:59:04,699
Oh, it's coming right at me.

359
00:59:04,699 --> 00:59:05,699
Oh!

360
00:59:05,699 --> 00:59:06,699
Even in...

361
00:59:06,699 --> 00:59:16,860
Oh, this is kind of hard.

362
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:27,320
Okay.

363
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:28,320
He just...

364
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:29,320
Come on.

365
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:35,869
I did it, right?

366
00:59:35,869 --> 00:59:49,210
150.

367
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:50,210
15.

368
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:51,210
Five, four, three, two, one, zero.

369
00:59:51,210 --> 00:59:53,730
Good.

370
00:59:53,730 --> 00:59:54,730
That's not a UFO.

371
00:59:54,730 --> 00:59:56,480
That's a Simon Says.

372
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:06,849
It does kind of look like that.

373
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:11,820
Titanic away.

374
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:18,099
Not every day you see a middle-aged man falling out of the sky.

375
01:00:18,099 --> 01:00:21,239
Thank you so much.

376
01:00:21,239 --> 01:00:22,239
That's okay.

377
01:00:22,239 --> 01:00:24,889
No big deal.

378
01:00:26,829 --> 01:00:30,119
Um...

379
01:00:30,119 --> 01:00:31,119
Oh!

380
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:32,119
Why did you...

381
01:00:32,119 --> 01:00:33,119
What have you done?

382
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:35,940
Bail water out of the boat.

383
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:39,940
Press X button repeatedly to scoop up water with a bucket-press triangle to empty it.

384
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:42,940
Avoid falling objects with an umbrella.

385
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:44,940
The directional buttons.

386
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:46,940
Reach the goal before it sinks.

387
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:01,320
Do I have to help him?

388
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:03,519
Wait, he...

389
01:01:03,519 --> 01:01:06,210
Oh, he's gone.

390
01:01:06,210 --> 01:01:07,210
Sorry, Captain.

391
01:01:07,210 --> 01:01:13,500
I hope I don't lose points for that.

392
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:14,500
What?

393
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:24,789
How did I not get points for that?

394
01:01:24,789 --> 01:01:25,789
Come on, help.

395
01:01:25,789 --> 01:01:28,630
Faster and faster and faster.

396
01:01:28,630 --> 01:01:29,630
Oh, here it comes, right?

397
01:01:29,630 --> 01:01:30,630
I tried to press it.

398
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:31,869
I tried to press it.

399
01:01:31,869 --> 01:01:32,869
It didn't do anything.

400
01:01:32,869 --> 01:01:36,349
Uh-oh.

401
01:01:36,349 --> 01:01:41,300
We're not moving.

402
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:42,300
We're not moving.

403
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:43,300
We're not moving.

404
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:44,300
We're not moving.

405
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:46,820
We're not moving.

406
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:58,409
If he goes in the air again, I'm doing it.

407
01:01:58,409 --> 01:01:59,409
Okay, here we go.

408
01:01:59,409 --> 01:02:02,309
Okay, that...

409
01:02:02,309 --> 01:02:11,230
Yeah, an umbrella wouldn't stop a guy not hitting you.

410
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:20,260
Just get out.

411
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:21,260
Come on, move.

412
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:28,769
I don't care.

413
01:02:28,769 --> 01:02:31,349
Just go.

414
01:02:31,349 --> 01:02:37,750
No, it's gonna sink.

415
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:38,750
He's trying to kill me?

416
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:50,829
I get it now.

417
01:02:50,829 --> 01:03:02,969
Can you hear the fucking furious tapping?

418
01:03:02,969 --> 01:03:03,969
Dodge, right?

419
01:03:03,969 --> 01:03:04,969
How do I dodge?

420
01:03:04,969 --> 01:03:10,659
I just left, right?

421
01:03:10,659 --> 01:03:16,380
You don't?

422
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:18,750
Wait, I'm just supposed to get hit by it?

423
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:33,980
I don't think I can dodge it.

424
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:35,980
I'm sure I can.

425
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:39,699
Fuck, I thought that was him.

426
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:51,420
Stop trying to fill it up all the way.

427
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:59,900
All right, let's...

428
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:01,900
No, I can't go forward.

429
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:03,900
I can't go left or right.

430
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:05,900
Maybe that's scripted.

431
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:19,380
Oh, come on.

432
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:20,380
Felt good.

433
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:35,769
Throw it.

434
01:04:35,769 --> 01:04:48,250
All right, dodge, dodge, dodge.

435
01:05:01,349 --> 01:05:02,349
No, come on, come on.

436
01:05:02,349 --> 01:05:04,349
50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50.

437
01:05:04,349 --> 01:05:09,349
37, 36, 35, 40, 15, 10.

438
01:05:09,349 --> 01:05:21,769
Give me a D, I don't care.

439
01:05:28,869 --> 01:05:29,869
Great Canadian FK Club.

440
01:05:29,869 --> 01:05:31,869
Another $50, 5,000 more bits from another person

441
01:05:31,869 --> 01:05:33,869
that's been like fucking seven of them.

442
01:05:33,869 --> 01:05:36,500
Thanks for the huge amount of money.

443
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:38,500
I cut the brake lines.

444
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:40,860
What's wrong with this lady?

445
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:43,170
What the hell was that?

446
01:05:43,170 --> 01:05:45,409
Did we just get like a Hideo Kojima?

447
01:05:45,409 --> 01:05:47,409
What was that?

448
01:05:47,409 --> 01:05:50,579
That was like a please unplug your things turning off, right?

449
01:05:50,579 --> 01:06:00,119
Okay, you just killed a dog.

450
01:06:00,119 --> 01:06:01,360
No, you didn't, thank God.

451
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:03,360
I was gonna say, worst game ever.

452
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:05,360
Honey, I'm home.

453
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:11,139
I made it to Grandma's.

454
01:06:11,139 --> 01:06:12,139
I did it.

455
01:06:12,139 --> 01:06:13,449
Great Canadian says,

456
01:06:13,449 --> 01:06:14,449
Great Canadian says,

457
01:06:14,449 --> 01:06:15,449
Is this like one of those flash games

458
01:06:15,449 --> 01:06:17,449
where you need to shake your mouse back and forth

459
01:06:17,449 --> 01:06:19,449
to make the story advance?

460
01:06:19,449 --> 01:06:24,719
That was an A.

461
01:06:24,719 --> 01:06:27,469
I got an A+.

462
01:06:27,469 --> 01:06:30,539
I did it right during the...

463
01:06:30,539 --> 01:06:36,110
I'm never gonna be able to hear this song ever again

464
01:06:36,110 --> 01:06:37,110
and think.

465
01:06:37,110 --> 01:06:39,420
It's always gonna bring back memories.

466
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:50,619
B and A equals an A+.

467
01:06:50,619 --> 01:06:52,619
Yeah, but I got extra credit.

468
01:06:52,619 --> 01:06:57,159
Story of Etsuko, Chapter One.

469
01:06:57,159 --> 01:06:58,159
Etsuko's errands.

470
01:06:58,159 --> 01:07:07,250
New character unlocked.

471
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:08,489
This is Mom?

472
01:07:08,489 --> 01:07:15,420
Okay.

473
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:23,409
Afternoon of the Wolves.

474
01:07:23,409 --> 01:07:24,409
Wolf robbery?

475
01:07:24,409 --> 01:07:28,440
Oh dear.

476
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:29,440
Get to the exit.

477
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:31,440
Press X repeatedly to move forward.

478
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:33,440
If the robbers are around,

479
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,440
step back with Triangle.

480
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:37,440
This is Five Nights at Freddy's.

481
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:40,059
Step back with Triangle.

482
01:07:40,059 --> 01:07:42,059
Use the security cameras to detect their location.

483
01:07:42,059 --> 01:07:45,059
Be alert when the robber indicator turns yellow.

484
01:07:45,059 --> 01:07:53,130
So where am I?

485
01:07:53,130 --> 01:07:54,690
Oh, it's coming.

486
01:07:54,690 --> 01:07:55,690
Okay.

487
01:07:55,690 --> 01:08:00,449
Hurry, hurry.

488
01:08:00,449 --> 01:08:01,449
Get to something.

489
01:08:01,449 --> 01:08:02,449
Go, go, go.

490
01:08:02,449 --> 01:08:03,820
Hide, hide, hide, hide, hide.

491
01:08:03,820 --> 01:08:09,840
Hide.

492
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:10,840
Okay.

493
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:14,320
Um.

494
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:16,010
No, no, no.

495
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:17,010
Stay, stay, stay.

496
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:18,010
So he goes left,

497
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:19,010
and then he,

498
01:08:19,010 --> 01:08:20,010
was he turned left again?

499
01:08:20,010 --> 01:08:21,010
It's probably gonna walk down this way.

500
01:08:21,010 --> 01:08:22,010
All right.

501
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:23,569
I'm gonna wait till he goes,

502
01:08:23,569 --> 01:08:24,569
walks this way.

503
01:08:24,569 --> 01:08:25,569
Is this,

504
01:08:25,569 --> 01:08:35,000
that guy's permanently looking this way though,

505
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,000
isn't he?

506
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:41,210
Okay, I'm right there.

507
01:08:41,210 --> 01:08:42,210
Why'd the guy,

508
01:08:42,210 --> 01:08:43,640
okay, hold on.

509
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:50,000
Go.

510
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:57,699
Who saw me?

511
01:08:57,699 --> 01:08:58,699
Top left.

512
01:08:58,699 --> 01:08:59,699
Oh, shit.

513
01:08:59,699 --> 01:09:00,699
Okay.

514
01:09:00,699 --> 01:09:05,460
I'm the next best.

515
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:13,569
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

516
01:09:13,569 --> 01:09:15,000
Hurry up.

517
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Hurry the fuck up.

518
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,180
He's so slow.

519
01:09:18,180 --> 01:09:24,090
Okay.

520
01:09:24,090 --> 01:09:40,750
He's gonna see me every time.

521
01:09:40,750 --> 01:09:47,560
Go.

522
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:48,560
What?

523
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:49,560
I'm trying to hide in the other bush.

524
01:09:49,560 --> 01:10:03,090
Get in there.

525
01:10:03,090 --> 01:10:04,090
What?

526
01:10:04,090 --> 01:10:06,289
Okay, I made it.

527
01:10:06,289 --> 01:10:09,909
So now I gotta go across to the couch.

528
01:10:09,909 --> 01:10:15,800
So I'm not safe here.

529
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:18,800
I'll be safe when he comes this way.

530
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:21,420
So here we go.

531
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:25,670
Bang.

532
01:10:25,670 --> 01:10:26,670
Safe.

533
01:10:26,670 --> 01:10:27,670
Here we are.

534
01:10:27,670 --> 01:10:29,300
Now we got a scenario.

535
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:31,300
We got red, top left.

536
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:33,300
Goes back and forth,

537
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:36,369
and then he goes that way.

538
01:10:36,369 --> 01:10:38,369
Red comes back down.

539
01:10:38,369 --> 01:10:39,369
When he turns this way,

540
01:10:39,369 --> 01:10:42,569
it's time to go now.

541
01:10:42,569 --> 01:10:45,729
What?

542
01:10:45,729 --> 01:10:46,729
No, I was,

543
01:10:46,729 --> 01:10:47,729
I thought it was gonna turn green.

544
01:10:47,729 --> 01:10:49,029
Fuck.

545
01:10:49,029 --> 01:10:50,029
I thought the one on the left was gonna turn green.

546
01:10:50,029 --> 01:10:51,029
I thought,

547
01:10:51,029 --> 01:10:52,029
cause he was green,

548
01:10:52,029 --> 01:10:53,029
I thought they was gonna turn green

549
01:10:53,029 --> 01:11:07,779
right when I stood up.

550
01:11:07,779 --> 01:11:15,350
I'm gonna get caught.

551
01:11:15,350 --> 01:11:30,369
Ma, just break a window and dive.

552
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:31,369
No, do it again.

553
01:11:31,369 --> 01:11:42,460
Do it again.

554
01:11:42,460 --> 01:11:43,460
Do it again.

555
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:46,050
Get there.

556
01:11:46,050 --> 01:11:54,069
Am I there?

557
01:11:54,069 --> 01:11:57,359
All right, here we go.

558
01:11:57,359 --> 01:12:00,359
Two, three, and go.

559
01:12:00,359 --> 01:12:08,180
Okay.

560
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:09,180
Now.

561
01:12:09,180 --> 01:12:12,140
I got,

562
01:12:12,140 --> 01:12:13,140
I'm right there.

563
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:15,140
He's now red.

564
01:12:15,140 --> 01:12:17,140
He's yellow up there.

565
01:12:17,140 --> 01:12:18,140
He's green.

566
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:19,140
He's still yellow.

567
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:20,140
Now he's red coming down.

568
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:21,140
Now I can go.

569
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:22,140
Not yet.

570
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:23,140
No.

571
01:12:23,140 --> 01:12:26,340
What's the scenario where they're all green?

572
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:27,340
Right there?

573
01:12:27,340 --> 01:12:29,609
Right there.

574
01:12:29,609 --> 01:12:30,609
One, two.

575
01:12:30,609 --> 01:12:31,609
All right.

576
01:12:31,609 --> 01:12:32,609
It's when,

577
01:12:32,609 --> 01:12:33,609
holy shit.

578
01:12:33,609 --> 01:12:35,869
Okay.

579
01:12:35,869 --> 01:12:36,869
It's when he walks down.

580
01:12:36,869 --> 01:12:37,869
When he comes down,

581
01:12:37,869 --> 01:12:40,109
I get an opportunity right now.

582
01:12:40,109 --> 01:12:42,119
No.

583
01:12:42,119 --> 01:12:43,119
It's gonna be,

584
01:12:43,119 --> 01:12:44,119
I should know that.

585
01:12:44,119 --> 01:12:47,090
I would have been caught.

586
01:12:47,090 --> 01:12:50,520
One, two, three, and comes again.

587
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:51,520
Here he comes.

588
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:52,520
Here we go.

589
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:54,520
This is the part where we go.

590
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:58,300
And here it comes.

591
01:12:58,300 --> 01:13:05,680
I'm spamming it.

592
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:06,680
Settle down.

593
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:07,680
Jesus, Cherubi.

594
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:08,680
Wait.

595
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:20,819
I have to steal the diamond pig.

596
01:13:20,819 --> 01:13:38,800
Oh my God.

597
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:39,800
Okay.

598
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:41,800
That was, I was about to say that's not,

599
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:43,800
that was very ridiculous.

600
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:47,409
Okay.

601
01:13:47,409 --> 01:13:48,409
You didn't,

602
01:13:48,409 --> 01:13:54,060
pound for pound.

603
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:55,060
Balance the weights.

604
01:13:55,060 --> 01:13:58,060
Move items from shopping basket into plastic bag

605
01:13:58,060 --> 01:14:01,060
so weight of bag and pig become equal.

606
01:14:01,060 --> 01:14:05,060
Use L1 and R1 to switch between basket and bag.

607
01:14:05,060 --> 01:14:07,060
Use the X button to select items

608
01:14:07,060 --> 01:14:10,060
and the square button to compare weights.

609
01:14:10,060 --> 01:14:12,060
You can select up to six items.

610
01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:15,579
Okay.

611
01:14:15,579 --> 01:14:17,340
There's Paw.

612
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:20,340
Snapper.

613
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:21,340
Okay.

614
01:14:21,340 --> 01:14:22,340

01:50:09,729 --> 01:50:13,770
until the meter reaches the green zone be aware of the meter disappearing at a

787
01:50:13,770 --> 01:50:18,090

the greatest sport ever invented but you guys didn't have pickleball everyone

807
01:54:29,180 --> 01:54:33,720
should know pickleball yeah I agree I'm shocked at this that's like one of the

808
01:54:33,720 --> 01:54:39,579
most fun it's like tennis and ping-pong mixed together into one sport yeah I

809
01:54:39,579 --> 01:54:43,560
just made a bunch of new pickleball fans some of you guys right now what the

810
01:54:43,560 --> 01:54:45,819

816
01:55:36,949 --> 01:55:43,529
would you rather have an old man or like an eight-year-old do this that's tricky

817
01:55:43,529 --> 01:55:56,229
I don't know the old man or think what if the old man goes down and it goes like

818
01:55:56,670 --> 01:56:09,890
and then he can't go any he's done but he throws his back up but he didn't

819
01:56:09,890 --> 01:56:19,689
though yeah I guess that's true if if he's not getting hurt by getting thrown
