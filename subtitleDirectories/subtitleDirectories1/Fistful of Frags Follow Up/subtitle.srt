00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:15,000
Hey, what's going on everybody? Jerma here with a Fistful of Frags gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,600
Fistful of Frags, what are you talking about? What's this game? What is Fistful of Frags?

3
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:26,170
It's the title of this game. It's the actual title of this Western Source Engine shooter from the video from a couple days ago.

4
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:30,660
And the reason why I'm making this video, this is a follow-up to that video.

5
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,829
I wanted to show some good gameplay of me playing this game and talk about it a little bit more in depth.

6
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:42,409
Collect my thoughts a little bit rather than just like throw knives at people and stuff and this is that video.

7
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:47,549
So Fistful of Frags, I'm just gonna very, very bluntly say this.

8
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:53,130
Although this game was originally released years ago as a Half-Life 2 mod,

9
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:57,729
this port to the Source Engine and this final release, I'm gonna put in quotes,

10
00:00:57,729 --> 00:01:06,230
is one of the most fun, most satisfying first-person shooter experiences I've had in like five years.

11
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:13,629
That's a pretty ridiculous statement considering the amount of AAA first-person shooters that have come out in the last few years.

12
00:01:13,629 --> 00:01:17,799
And there's not even a whole lot of content in this game right now.

13
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:23,599
Apparently the developer is gonna add a bunch of stuff later on, but I don't know how.

14
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:29,200
The game's free. This is a free game. There's no things to buy at the moment.

15
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,599
It's just a free download and you can play it for free. There's no strings attached.

16
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:40,599
It's unbelievable that this game is as free as it is and I'm having as much fun in it as I am.

17
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:45,900
And yes, the game is rough around the edges. Yes, the game is a little sloppy in some regards,

18
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:50,799
but at the same time, I think that's what gives it a little bit of charm as well.

19
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,400
The sort of strange physics that happen when you drop a dynamite on somebody's feet,

20
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,400
the strange sort of voice lines that people have,

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,599
Pass, pass, pass, pass, pass a whiskey. I like it. I like charm.

22
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:09,099
If a game has charm, I will probably enjoy it. I will probably like it more than a game

23
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:18,240
that's your typical spray and pray, hold the button down, military shooters that we've become very used to in the last decade.

24
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,439
And that's why I love TF2 so much. Team Fortress 2 is one of those games that was just so off the beaten path.

25
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:29,039
It was just so crazy to me. I just had so much charm. It was just blistering with style.

26
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:33,439
I had to love it and I had to play it and it's become one of my favorite games of all time.

27
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:38,620
Now this game is sort of in that same category. It's not your typical shooter.

28
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:45,419
When was the last Western FPS, not third person, because of course Red Dead Redemption would take that role.

29
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:49,659
But when was the last first person shooter Western themed multiplayer game?

30
00:02:49,659 --> 00:02:54,460
There's like maybe five that have ever come out in the history of video games.

31
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:59,659
I can't think of any. I can think of maybe one or two that came out a long time ago.

32
00:02:59,659 --> 00:03:03,800
But recent, in the last 10 years, this is one of the only ones.

33
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,000
And it's pretty good, as you can tell by the tone of my voice.

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,800
And I've done two videos in a row on this game so far, which I don't know when the last time I did that.

35
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,639
Can you guys think of the last time?

36
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:17,639
Now here's a good indication of how much fun I've been having.

37
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:20,810
I've put probably five hours so far into the game total.

38
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:28,009
When was the last time I made a video about a game and then like immediately made another video about that same game?

39
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:30,569
Talking about how good it is. I don't know.

40
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:36,580
You got Team Fortress 2 and like Super Meat Boy, like some of the only ones.

41
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,780
So you can tell I like this game. This is not just bullshit.

42
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:45,219
I'm not bullshitting you that this is a good game because I think it really is.

43
00:03:45,219 --> 00:03:50,419
And I just wanted to hammer that point home to you guys, especially those that were on the fence of even downloading it.

44
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:54,620
Maybe it looks kind of crappy. I don't know. This kind of looks like a shitty game.

45
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,819
Don't let the looks deceive you.

46
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:02,419
If you're into very high skill ceiling, you know, landing shots, throwing projectiles.

47
00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:09,460
If you're into that type of stuff, you're going to really be into the high risk versus the high reward that this game gives.

48
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:12,259
Yes, it can be wonky. Yes, it can be sloppy.

49
00:04:12,259 --> 00:04:14,860
But still, it's got that flavor to it.

50
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,860
When you get that bang, you get that nice shot on somebody.

51
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:21,259
You throw that tomahawk across the map and it hits somebody in the face.

52
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:24,259
It's got a lot of awesome stuff that you can do in it.

53
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:32,459
And I would say at least give it a try. At least jump into it for an hour or so and grab some buddies and just go into the old west and just start gunslinging.

54
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:36,490
That's my my advice to those that want to check it out.

55
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:45,089
And to wrap this video up, I'm going to say for the next minute or so long live the modding community, long live modders.

56
00:04:45,089 --> 00:04:53,730
And if you're a game developer and you don't want to support modders and you think that modding is stupid or bad or ruins your game,

57
00:04:53,730 --> 00:05:02,100
you better talk to a handful of people because not only is this a original a mod of Half-Life 2, which grew into its own shoes here,

58
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:08,670
Team Fortress was a mod of a game. DayZ is a mod of a game originally.

59
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:11,050
Counter-Strike was a mod of a game.

60
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:17,920
Dota, Defense of the Ancients, one of the most popular things on planet Earth in gaming.

61
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:22,350
Dota, League of Legends, was started as a mod.

62
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:27,189
So Mike, this is just a standalone comment at the end of this video.

63
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:32,189
And I've made this video. I've talked about mods before in an entire video.

64
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:35,990
So I don't really need to go into that much more detail besides the sentence I just said.

65
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:41,589
But it needs to be noted that some of the most popular franchises were started as a mod.

66
00:05:41,589 --> 00:05:46,430
And who knows, this one could take off, it might not, but if it does, cool.

67
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:49,029
And that's pretty much all I got to say.

68
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:53,829
But yes, guys, Fistful of Frags, free on Steam, free, free, free, free, free, 100% free.

69
00:05:53,829 --> 00:05:55,029
It's a lot of fun.

70
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:56,629
I'd go get it.

71
00:05:56,629 --> 00:05:57,829
And that's pretty much it.

72
00:05:57,829 --> 00:05:59,230
And host a server too.

73
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,430
I forgot to mention this.

74
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:04,829
This game is in dire need of dedicated servers because of so many people are starting to play it.

75
00:06:04,829 --> 00:06:10,230
So if you have a server capabilities, if you make servers, if you run a bunch of servers,

76
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:14,829
maybe think about making one for Fistful of Frags because I'm thinking about doing it as well.

77
00:06:14,829 --> 00:06:17,230
I'm not sure if that will be this week or next week or something.

78
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,829
I need to iron up the details, but I will let you guys know regardless.

79
00:06:19,829 --> 00:06:21,430
And that's going to wrap up the video. Thanks for watching.

80
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,629
And I'll see you guys all next time.

81
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:31,220
And of course, take care, everyone.

82
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,019
Pass or whiskey?
