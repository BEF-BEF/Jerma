1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:17,879
All right, I have... Am I really starting with this one? I kind of have to. We're gonna start

2
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:34,939
with Caveman Olympics, I guess. Streamer's Choice? Uh, this is Streamer's Choice, yeah. I had to get

3
00:00:34,939 --> 00:00:52,659
one ready. Well, maybe, uh, maybe we'll do... All right, what do you guys think? Caveman Olympics,

4
00:00:54,179 --> 00:01:08,340
Museum Madness, or Pizza Tycoon? Pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza! All right, all right,

5
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:17,989
we'll do Pizza Tycoon. Let's get it going. I have to turn it down a little. It's gonna be loud as

6
00:01:17,989 --> 00:01:32,170
heck. Here we go. Knew it. I just saved you guys so fast. You have no idea. Do you understand how

7
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:42,709
this is at 30% volume? If this was at 100%, some... somebody would have been hurt. I'm so happy I caught

8
00:01:42,709 --> 00:01:58,120
that when I did. All right, so let's get it open here. This is, uh, here we go. This is that,

9
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:17,900
huh? Pizza Shop, whatever this is. Pizza Tycoon. Main, what does special animation mean? This is

10
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:31,500
very bright. Okay, how do I just go? Old game, new game. I've never played this before. I guess,

11
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:42,069
new game. Mission mode, free mode, let's do mission mode. Select mission. Entry, rise, fall,

12
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:54,710
gangster, tricky, traveler, winner, short, gangster. Um, let's just figure, let's just do entry.

13
00:02:56,409 --> 00:03:03,930
Entry. 1394 arrival in Berlin, takes out the first loan, opens first restaurant, first own pizza.

14
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:14,409
Able to meet 100% of deliveries for one week. I don't understand what this is. First own pizza.

15
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:24,539
Uh, what is rise? Arrival in Paris. You then are a worker, get first prize in pizza competition.

16
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:38,300
A thousand pizzas sold in a single day. That seems like it's not possible. Ten thousand dollar

17
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:46,139
turnover in one day. A thousand pizzas in a day? I'm not even sure McDonald's sells a thousand Big

18
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:57,639
Macs in a day across the whole entire world. Do they? Arrival in Baltimore, open first restaurant,

19
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:03,159
first own pizza. A thousand kilograms of ingredients used in a day. That's so much.

20
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:16,180
And then win 10 grand. What is gangster? Okay, you arrive in London, make first contact with mafia.

21
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:27,639
Tricky. First raid on competitor has assets of $500,000, but I'm stealing from a competitor?

22
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:37,819
We're just gonna do entry. Here we go. Select level. Push over, easy, normal, or we're gonna do

23
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:59,910
just normal. Jonathan Jaypes has $8,000, age 41, popularity 45. Does that 100? 45 intelligence,

24
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:25,589
30 charisma, 18 courage. Denis Flatulenceau. It's got a terrible personality though. No, terrible

25
00:05:25,589 --> 00:05:33,800
cooking. Got a great personality. And this is the name of the restaurant? Pizzaland. Wait, what?

26
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:52,490
What's going on? There. Uh, no, no, no. What? Really? There's a Donald Trump in this game?

27
00:05:54,550 --> 00:06:27,610
There's a Muppet Beaker Trump. Sorry, I had to get away from that one. That was... Okay, uh,

28
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:39,430
uh, Pizzaland. Whatever. That's fine. Pizzaland, charisma, intelligence, 85, energy, 38, health,

29
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:59,129
40. Well, it's Alfredo, Ronnie, Rhonda, Elvis is an Elvis. Okay, these are... Wait, what was this?

30
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:08,519
This guy. I like this guy. Sure. But he sucks at everything. I'm just gonna go.

31
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:28,220
Wow. Well, what a fucked up world we live in. In whatever this, what time frame this is. New

32
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:39,189
York, Baltimore, Chicago. Chicago's not all the way up here. That's like Canada. Madrid, Vienna.

33
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:51,060
Let's just go to, uh, let's just go to, um, let's go to Italy. Let's go to, let's go to Rome. Market

34
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:59,160
leader nobody. Nobody's ever made a pizza before in this room. Sounds good. Wait, what? Nobody.

35
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:12,220
What time? Is this back in like the caveman times? Nobody's made a pizza yet? Oh, pizza you eat.

36
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:22,279
Range, location, district. What am I looking at? That's clearly, this is just a worse,

37
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:28,199
this is like a pegboard version of this one. Um, map, character, mission mode one,

38
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:34,179
Dennis Flatulenza. That's not me. Start of the day, nine o'clock. Wait, start of the day five,

39
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:48,460
four a.m. Start of the day, score, position, loser, failure, okay. Turn page. Look at the,

40
00:08:49,419 --> 00:09:03,769
I gotta go to Berlin? Take it alone? Okay, how do I make a pizza? Locations. Uh, the church, the bank,

41
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:23,240
the cinema, the disco. Why would I have a pizza restaurant in a church? What's this? Why am I like

42
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:49,500
Google earthing? Road, what? Hotel gyms? Where's my restaurant? We messed up, please next.

43
00:09:53,210 --> 00:10:25,799
Wait, I can end my turn. The bank. Uh, yeah, this is very complicated. I'm not exactly sure what I'm

44
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:39,370
supposed to be doing here in pizza tycoon terminal. What? I don't have any time to waste with little

45
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:56,100
people like you. Goodbye. That's the BF Bugleberry mask. Agree. NYPD? Who are you? Get out of here

46
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:09,850
at once. Why is the NYPD in an old-timey western sheriff's uniform? I don't understand. I think I

47
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:19,909
just want to call people. Let's call Wall Street Finance. Wall Street Finance may help you.

48
00:11:20,789 --> 00:11:25,559
Agree. I need a loan. I want to invest some money. I want to transfer. I want to repay. I want to,

49
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:32,659
I want to, I want to invest some money. I want a loan. We can offer you the following loan

50
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:52,460
arrangement. $3,000 interest, 23%. 12 months. What? A 23% interest? Okay. I want to transfer

51
00:11:52,460 --> 00:12:15,379
some money. Transfer $8,600 to account number. I need account numbers? Mine? Okay. Um, BMART.

52
00:12:20,179 --> 00:12:29,049
BMART. How may I help you? What? Why do they all have so much money behind them? Okay. Other?

53
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:42,919
Reservoir frogs? Holy shit. Hey you lousy little pizza maker. Where's the fire?

54
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:49,740
Um, looking for a job on the side. Pick up a suitcase full of pirated films in the hotel tower

55
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:55,500
in Union City on March 4th at 1030 and bring it to the Hotel Low Society in Manhattan on March 5th.

56
00:12:56,299 --> 00:13:03,899
Um, okay. If you're successful, you'll get $1,638. The risk is 9% interest. Do you accept the mission?

57
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:08,950
Sure. We expect you to carry out the orders to the letter and with absolute discretion. Okay.

58
00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:22,330
Um, just going around. I'm just like, welcome to our little joke shop. We have, we have something

59
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:29,000
for everybody. Do you have ice cream? We just imported some delicious ice cream. What's your

60
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:40,220
favorite? Lemon. One scoop is $11,000. Okay. How many scoops do you want? Um, 20. Okay. Well,

61
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:50,059
I can't afford ice cream. Hey there, you lousy pizza maker. Uh, I'm looking for a job.

62
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:55,500
You've already got one. I need money now. Before you can hit the big time, we need to get to know

63
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,059
you better. You have some, you have to make a name for yourself. All right. What do I have to do?

64
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:08,980
All right. Hey, I got a NYPD. I got something for you. Who are you? Get out. Never mind. Okay. I

65
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:36,100
have to deliver the, I don't even remember the street. I'm done. This one's done. We're going to

66
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:55,269
go with another one called museum madness. This one looks very interesting. I can turn this up

67
00:14:55,269 --> 00:15:05,929
a little bit. I think science and history learning mystery museum madness. Wait, let me, I can break

68
00:15:05,929 --> 00:15:16,379
it up a little bit. Okay. That's fine. Just want to turn it up a little. This is my room.

69
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:27,259
Detail. The national museum database usually has tons of great stuff. That dinosaur puzzle I

70
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:33,940
downloaded last month was excellent, but there isn't anything new since then. I think I'll quit

71
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:39,299
info surfing and sign off for tonight. I sure miss talking to Mick, the museum information computer

72
00:15:39,299 --> 00:15:45,700
kiosk. That robot knows everything about the museum. Too bad he's offline until the museum

73
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:59,799
computers are fixed. Interactive system service national museum. Please wait. Now this would

74
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:05,559
terrify me as an eight year old. Oh, cool. It's Mick. I thought you were offline while the museum

75
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:09,159
was being converted to total computer control. I guess you missed me too much since I'm the only

76
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:16,919
one who knows you can think for yourself. Ever since I discovered you could talk back to me last

77
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:28,330
year, you've given me the best information about the museum was offline undergoing reprogramming,

78
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:34,250
but I have returned because I need your help. The entire national museum is in danger.

79
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:39,049
You must help me save it before its secrets are lost forever. You know I am responsible for

80
00:16:39,049 --> 00:16:43,690
maintaining the museum database. The database has been corrupted and the museum exhibits are

81
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:53,289
out of control. And only this eight year old boy can do it and not the police or the FBI or like

82
00:16:53,289 --> 00:16:59,029
the CIA or anything. You. This is some sort of new online game, right? How can the museum be in

83
00:16:59,029 --> 00:17:02,950
danger? I know you're the guardian of the museum's database, but this is a little strange, don't you

84
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:11,339
think? This is no game. A strange force has taken over the museum since it closed a month ago to

85
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:16,619
undergo conversion to total computer control. The exhibits have come to life. They're acting very

86
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:21,660
peculiar. I suspect that a virus has invaded the system and corrupted the main control program.

87
00:17:22,299 --> 00:17:26,059
You must come to the museum at once and help me track down the virus. Don't go.

88
00:17:27,019 --> 00:17:36,920
This is very weird, Mick. How can I help? I know you're the one in charge of keeping the museum

89
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:41,640
database in shape, but you keep saying that so strangely. And I know you always tell the truth,

90
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:50,099
but what can I do? You must come to the museum at once. My power is failing and my memory has

91
00:17:50,099 --> 00:18:01,559
been corrupted. I cannot last much longer. I don't know about this, but Mick has been programmed to

92
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:05,720
always act in the best interest of the museum. He's always given me good information and helped

93
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:10,759
me solve problems using my museum database. Yeah. If he says I'm the only one who can help,

94
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:14,440
then I guess I have to believe him. Besides, he's a good friend and he needs my help.

95
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:22,920
I will download a program onto your floppy drive. Bring the disk with you.

96
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:27,319
It contains vital information. You will know how to use it when you get inside.

97
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:32,440
I must sign off now. I think I hear the dinosaurs roaring. Or is that the Wright brothers playing?

98
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:42,650
Hurry! I cannot last much longer. Adam Sandler made a movie about this like 10 years ago already.

99
00:18:43,529 --> 00:18:50,460
I mean, no, Ben, not Ben Stiller. Robots? Dinosaurs? The Wright brothers? I guess I

100
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,779
have to do something. I know I can trust Mick because he is programmed to always tell the truth.

101
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:59,500
What about you? You sound pretty programmed too, to say the same like five words.

102
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:08,940
I better get down to the museum and check this out. That was just to get to the title card.

103
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:24,950
Guys, is Mick programmed to always tell the truth? I'm not sure. I thought maybe possible.

104
00:19:25,829 --> 00:19:36,970
They always did the pre-credits thing back here. Is this Pokemon? That's the same outfit. Okay,

105
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:40,329
I'm here. I'm glad I waited until morning. This place could be very creepy at night.

106
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:51,990
It's the same image. It's the same image, but they just put a hat on him and put like a t-shirt here

107
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:57,180
with a good backpack. Wait, I'm gonna get grounded now. How do I get inside? Mick wasn't much help.

108
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:12,779
I guess I'll have to figure it out for myself. You made it up the stairs. Good for you. I wonder

109
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:17,210
if anyone's around. Maybe I should take a closer look. I know the museum is closed for repairs.

110
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:26,119
Maybe someone left a door open or something. What happened? Am I blacking out?

111
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:50,680
I can't read this.

112
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:13,619
An angered age the combination lock on the guide door. You know the combination, but if you forgot,

113
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:20,180
just look it up. Once you are inside, follow the game radar to the entrance hall. See you tomorrow.

114
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:30,500
If you forget, just look up. Once you are inside, follow the same order to the... I don't know what

115
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:38,630
this says. Oh no! Okay, if I go all the way... I have to go all the way back here. I can read this.

116
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:46,440
Pull back in your chair and go all the way back. I had to leave early. If you need to get inside,

117
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:52,359
use the combination lock on the side door. You know the combination, but if you forget, just look up.

118
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:57,000
Once you are inside, follow the same order to the entrance hall. See you tomorrow. The game order.

119
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:04,470
Whatever. All right, let's go. Smash the fucking window. All right, side door.

120
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:22,599
I feel like this is not possible to screw this up. This place is spooky. I hope I don't bump into

121
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:35,980
anything. All right, look up. What the hell was that? Do I have weapons? Who gave this kid a knife?

122
00:22:45,049 --> 00:23:02,420
Um, pen, anger cheat. No, I want to like look up. If you forget it, just look up. Oh, what kind of

123
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:09,400
password is this? I know I've seen these symbols somewhere before. Maybe I should look around

124
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:23,849
outside to jog my memory. Why would you need to shine the flashlight on this? Uh, was it outside?

125
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:47,029
I had to look up. I can't look up. This is the password to the door. This is the equivalent of

126
00:23:47,029 --> 00:23:54,230
me like pasting my stream key on my house. Okay, uh, American flag globe. All right, America globe

127
00:23:54,789 --> 00:24:06,309
tree ship computer. American flag all of the world. Flag world tree ship computer.

128
00:24:07,349 --> 00:24:27,190
Flag world tree ship computer. Flag world tree ship computer. Got it. Same thing. Get the light

129
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:48,859
out. Flag world tree ship computer. Flag world tree ship computer. There we go. Uh, what is that?

130
00:24:48,859 --> 00:24:58,940
What did I just pick up? Car to room one. Am I in the museum? What is the kind of museum is this?

131
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:18,940
What the hell is this? Uh, this is room three. I don't know what room this is. Exit to museum.

132
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:45,539
No, no, I need to go to room one. Three. What? Two. This is room two to room four. No, I need room one.

133
00:25:52,140 --> 00:26:06,279
Exit. Wouldn't room one be like right here? No, that's room three. Which room is this?

134
00:26:08,069 --> 00:26:42,420
Workshop. It's locked. Found it. Hard read around room one. Nice. Door locked. Earth is all this

135
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:45,220
stuff. I'm going to have to remember this. All right. It's another one of these stupid things.

136
00:26:45,859 --> 00:26:53,460
Um, all right. Flag statue. Uh, is this supposed to be like one, two, three, four, five? Flag statue

137
00:26:53,460 --> 00:27:01,480
mountain train witch. Flag statue mountain train witch. Flag statue mountain train witch.

138
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:19,299
All right, let's find two. Flag. Um, uh, flag mountain something mountain train witch.

139
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:32,740
Flag statue mountain train witch. Did it move? It was, it was two and four. Where is it?

140
00:27:40,490 --> 00:28:05,450
What the fuck is happening? I got it. What was it? Um, flag statue mountain train witch. Uh, flag

141
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:17,339
flag statue mountain train witch. Flag statue mountain train witch. Factory factory pyramid

142
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:28,730
hammer shield book. Factory pyramid hammer shield book. Um, flag statue mountain train witch.

143
00:28:29,369 --> 00:28:36,940
Factory pyramid hammer shield. Somebody just screenshot this. Just somebody got one.

144
00:28:37,579 --> 00:28:50,819
What's this next key for? Three. I think somebody made this just to fuck with this kid.

145
00:28:51,539 --> 00:29:01,640
You know what I mean? This is the wall. These walls are cardboard. This is not even a real place.

146
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:36,710
Where is three? No, that's four. Uh, right? No, left. Which one is this one? Is this three?

147
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:58,680
Got it. Let's hope it's not boxes with symbols. It is. Seahorse. Let's just screenshot it.

148
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:05,609
All righty, take it. Good. Somebody get it? Good. Now I gotta go find four again.

149
00:30:06,329 --> 00:30:16,730
But there's five. Is it five? I don't even come. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Five is across from

150
00:30:18,099 --> 00:30:29,859
two. This is two. This is one. Five is across from one. What do I have? Four.

151
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:55,670
That's three. The box is one was two. I mean one. Here comes five. Five is across from three.

152
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:05,380
Just make a map. Do you think I have like paper and like crayons in front of me? I'm at my desk.

153
00:31:06,099 --> 00:31:25,000
Screenshot this. Five is across from three. Down here is the workshop. All right, all right. Turn

154
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,640
around. It's directly in front of me. No, it's not. It's not directly in front of me because

155
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:56,759
that's the workshop. Wait. Stop. Stop. Stop. All right. I think that's it. You define no idea

156
00:31:56,759 --> 00:32:10,410
where I'm going. That's where five is supposed to be. This is like the reddlers behind this.

157
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:17,500
I told you they just fuck with me. It's across from there.

158
00:32:38,009 --> 00:32:44,900
It's not it. That's the exit. Oh shit. Okay. Does anybody have any idea from here

159
00:32:45,619 --> 00:32:57,819
where to get, how to get to five? I think I've tried every option. That's this. There is no five.

160
00:32:57,819 --> 00:33:12,119
It has to be. This is two and four. Okay. That's two and four. There. But I don't even know what

161
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:36,569
direction I'm turning. Um, over here. I need Mick. Mick, help. Help me, Mick. It's not that one. It's

162
00:33:36,569 --> 00:33:41,369
not the one when I turn around. That's the exit. But I'm not even facing the right way. Like,

163
00:33:41,369 --> 00:33:51,579
you understand? Like this is, this is all fucked up. That's not it. This is the exit. This, okay.

164
00:33:51,579 --> 00:34:02,890
Over here is two and four. This is a circle. All right. Hold on a minute. No, stop. Don't take,

165
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:43,690
don't comb your hair. Wasn't it right here? I don't even think there's another door.

166
00:34:44,329 --> 00:35:11,559
What's this other door? Card to the museum door. Got it. Let's go. Let's go. I'm, get fucking

167
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:26,699
excited. I am pumped right now. Oh, there he is. This must be the main hall of the museum. It looks

168
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:31,820
more like the inside of a doom at night. I wonder if this place is haunted. Oh, there's Mick. I wonder

169
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:35,420
why he doesn't say something to me. He said, I'd know what to do when I got here. I guess I'm still

170
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:45,320
on my own. I.O. error. What do you mean I.O. error? You've got me all the way down here to tell me you

171
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:52,360
have an I.O. error? Take two aspirin and get over it. I thought you needed my help. Passive, aggressive.

172
00:35:53,400 --> 00:36:03,639
Now that's just straight up aggressive. Wait, wait, what'd he say? Maybe he's trying to tell me

173
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:07,320
something. That's the message I get from my computer when I haven't put the disc in the drive.

174
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:19,269
What kept you? I've been waiting for you to arrive. My power is fading fast. You must act

175
00:36:19,269 --> 00:36:26,119
quickly. I need a new bat. Well, why didn't you tell me to come in through the skylight

176
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:32,860
instead of through the maze? Keep your silicon shirt on. You didn't give me much help. Hey,

177
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:43,260
what's going on? You need bats? I need new bat. You need a bat? What, batter up? Bats and you

178
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:48,300
Belfry? Batman? I guess I should look for something batty. This better be worth it. I'm

179
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:59,739
missing the next episode of America's Most Unwanted. Hey, well, let's be fair. This kid is

180
00:37:00,539 --> 00:37:12,500
like a pen. Museum tour on tape. Batteries included. All right, well, let's open it up.

181
00:37:13,219 --> 00:37:37,429
The kid's pretty handy. All right, it has batteries. He just jabbed it with the knife. That

182
00:37:37,429 --> 00:37:45,369
battery's here. Yeah, take some soda. Oh, that's better. I was almost a victim of an energy crisis.

183
00:37:45,369 --> 00:37:49,929
We have to work quickly to save the museum before my power runs low again. Please insert

184
00:37:49,929 --> 00:37:56,789
the disc again so that I may reprocess the data I sent you. I'm working on it. Why did it get

185
00:37:56,789 --> 00:38:11,960
so mean? I have reprocessed the information on the disc. The virus caused large gaps in my memory

186
00:38:12,519 --> 00:38:18,519
but I was able to reconstruct some of the missing data from the program I modemed to you.

187
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:23,909
I have modified the disc and put a new label on it. You can use the disc to save a record of your

188
00:38:23,909 --> 00:38:29,659
progress through the museum. Until all of the gaps are filled in, we cannot discover the source of

189
00:38:29,659 --> 00:38:35,670
the virus that has infected the museum computers. The virus has thrown the exhibits into chaos.

190
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:38,309
We must go to each exhibit and restore it to its normal state.

191
00:38:38,309 --> 00:38:48,860
I'm not sure anything is ever normal around here but that sounds like fun. How do we get started?

192
00:38:50,039 --> 00:38:53,639
First, there are a few things you should know. The exhibits are now fully automated. Read the

193
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:58,599
holographic information displays that appear as you enter each exhibit. You can access more

194
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:03,239
information by activating the hollow displays in each exhibit room. They are on the left.

195
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:09,719
Cool. That way I'll know what's going on, I think. Be careful. All exhibit computer systems

196
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:14,760
have been corrupted, including the cybernetic replicas. The SIREPs are robots that look like

197
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:20,710
people from history. You must interact with them to fix the exhibits. Then I have to talk to the

198
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:25,989
robots that look like people from history books. Yes, that is what was just said. Excellent. Will

199
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:31,960
you be there to help me? I will accompany you to each exhibit. When we arrive, I will link myself

200
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:35,400
to the main computer and try to calculate what must be done to restore the exhibit.

201
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:40,199
I will provide you with data for each room but my processing power is limited and I don't need

202
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:43,320
batteries and there are gaps in the database due to the effects of the virus and the thing

203
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:47,480
that you put in. Okay, got it. We go to each exhibit. I check out the information displays

204
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,920
that I checked with you to see what's happening after that. I talk to any SIREPs that are hanging

205
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:55,239
out. Then I fix what's wrong with the exhibit. If I get stuck, you can give me some help unless

206
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:58,599
that part of your brain has been fried. No sweat, let's get started. How do I get to the first

207
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:02,760
exhibit? Use the map on the wall to unlock the exhibits. When we arrive, consult me again to

208
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,880
learn what you must do. Remember, you must restore the exhibit before you can find the source of the

209
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:29,289
virus. Oh my god, let's go. I actually don't remember where to go. What is this? No! This is

210
00:40:29,289 --> 00:40:37,099
a mess. It looks more like spaghetti than a map. How do you see spaghetti here? I think this kid

211
00:40:37,099 --> 00:40:42,420
needs a coffee. The map has been scrambled by the same force that is affecting the museum. You must

212
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:47,780
unscramble it before we can unlock the exhibits but we're gonna be here for a while. Try touching

213
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:52,500
one square and then another to rearrange them until the map is fixed. I'm gonna shut down for a while

214
00:40:52,500 --> 00:41:22,070
to save my energy. You do it. I just yawned. Fuck. It connects to this on the other side here.

215
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:34,150
I need the left side here. Where's the left side? All right, I got that. That's good. I got

216
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:41,579
this one over here. All right, then that goes up. More of these like clouds, whatever they are.

217
00:41:42,139 --> 00:41:50,309
No, where is it? Right here. That leads up to the green area, which is this one, and then that leads

218
00:41:50,309 --> 00:42:01,539
up to here. Huh, now that's a good question. I'll ask it again. I did ask a question. Here we go.

219
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:11,420
All right, this one comes over here. To the middle, correct?

220
00:42:14,809 --> 00:42:16,730
Everyone is resident sleeper right now.

221
00:42:22,179 --> 00:42:27,300
We gotta give this one a chance. We do. I'm sorry, we have to give this one a chance.

222
00:42:28,019 --> 00:42:43,670
Where is the... where the hell does this one go? Is it like a cap? No, shit. There it is. Okay, then we bring this one over here.

223
00:42:46,409 --> 00:42:54,820
It's wrong. Wrong. Correct. Okay, we need the... this one definitely goes over here.

224
00:42:55,699 --> 00:43:08,409
No, it doesn't. One doesn't either. Uh, something went wrong here.

225
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:32,519
Oh, I think this all goes up. The whole middle is fucked up. Wait, hold on. Give me a moment.

226
00:43:33,239 --> 00:43:43,829
I just simply have to go like this. Okay, but this is... how is this wrong? I need this one down here.

227
00:43:45,269 --> 00:43:57,159
No, where is it? It's like right here. There it is. I'm fixing it. Don't worry, I got it. Okay, all right.

228
00:43:57,639 --> 00:44:12,469
I'm going. I'm going. All right, now there's this one over here, this one over here,

229
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:29,750
that one over here. Bingo. I'm glad to see you finally finished the map. Now we can proceed to

230
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:37,210
the exhibits. What do you mean finally? Something tells me I'm gonna be doing all the work. We have

231
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:41,050
no time for this idle chatter. I have analyzed the present state of the museum exhibits. We can

232
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:46,010
proceed to any exhibit. They're all desperately in need of help. We should move quickly before

233
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:54,469
and my power runs out. Don't tempt me to slow down. What do we do now? Yes, I know the map will

234
00:44:54,469 --> 00:44:58,389
unlock the exhibits. Just touch a location on the map to unlock that exhibit hall. I will fill you

235
00:44:58,389 --> 00:45:11,429
in on the situation when we get there. I mean, we have to go to the dinosaur one. There's a lot.

236
00:45:11,429 --> 00:45:19,429
A hall of robots, computer tech, radio, energy, simple machines, boring. How big is the universe?

237
00:45:19,429 --> 00:45:23,909
Kind of good. Solo system. Cool. Rockets and computers. All right. Air powered flight. The

238
00:45:23,909 --> 00:45:34,360
Wright brothers. Cool. Salem witch trials. Ellis Island. Hall of the dinosaurs. I don't see any

239
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:57,059
others. Dinosaurs were first discovered in the 1820s. In my brain it was like they're like birds.

240
00:45:57,059 --> 00:46:02,539
We like found them. They're still around. Since then their remains have been found on every

241
00:46:02,539 --> 00:46:06,139
continent. They were the largest creatures to ever live on land and they dominated the earth

242
00:46:06,139 --> 00:46:13,860
for 150 million years. This is a computer lab. I don't know what they do here but it sure looks

243
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:29,719
important. Maybe it's some type of government work. Where are the dinosaurs? There's 150 years. Many

244
00:46:29,719 --> 00:46:40,760
scientists excavate dinosaurs as fossils. You can make them into models. There's a computer program

245
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:47,849
that assembles the bones completely. The dinosaur reconstruction computer assembles a dinosaur

246
00:46:47,849 --> 00:46:51,690
within a few minutes. This computer's on display here. Okay you can make a dinosaur in a few minutes.

247
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:58,809
Program to build the dinosaur had this dinosaur reconstruction program has been wrecked by the

248
00:46:58,809 --> 00:47:03,289
museum-wide computer virus. Say okay. Go fix it. The dinosaur skeletons it built are completely

249
00:47:03,289 --> 00:47:10,010
corrupted. You must rebuild the skeletons. You got it. This is a dinosaur bone assembly program.

250
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:18,219
Why not try the controls and take this thing for a spin. This is supposed to be a triceratops.

251
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:51,210
Okay this is just auto. All right triceratops. That one. Wait no why is this changing? What's

252
00:47:51,210 --> 00:48:10,780
going on? Why is it changing? I thought it wanted me to make a triceratops. Okay I got it. There it

253
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:35,429
is. What about the tail? That's it right? Different neck. That's not a triceratops.

254
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:54,650
It's the legs. That's but they're also wrong. The legs aren't even touching the crown.

255
00:48:56,059 --> 00:49:37,880
It's the front legs. That's not correct. This is correct but they didn't have a big tail. Wait hold

256
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:56,570
on. That looks close. Oh fuck. Okay we'll make the t-rex. T-rex head. There's t-rex neck. Body.

257
00:49:57,130 --> 00:50:29,050
It's that one. Here's the little baby hands. This is making me laugh way too much. Okay.

258
00:50:33,449 --> 00:51:03,000
Help. T-rex. So just the tail. That doesn't fit. This is correct. The legs I think. Is that it?

259
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:23,449
That looks. I mean what does the t-rex's tail look like? Doesn't look like that. It's kind of long

260
00:51:23,449 --> 00:51:55,239
isn't it? I think it's this one. I think it's that one. Oh god damn it. Let me do like the prayer

261
00:51:55,239 --> 00:52:11,739
hands. It doesn't look like anything. There it is. That's not the t-rex. That's not the t-rex.

262
00:52:11,739 --> 00:52:53,190
I'm surprised. No that was. This is a t-rex head. The tail. This head is too small. I got it. Whoa

263
00:52:53,190 --> 00:53:01,349
that's a fucking big fatty. That's not. That is not what a t-rex looks like. Bullshit. This is

264
00:53:01,349 --> 00:53:09,980
Slimer from Ghostbusters. That is not a t-rex. That is a frog. Bull. I die. That is absolute dog

265
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:20,340
shit. I refuse to accept that one. I don't even know what that looks like. Stegosaurus. I can do

266
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:57,289
this one. Fucking t-rex. Give me a break. What is going on here? It's a new dinosaur. Ah Frank I

267
00:53:57,289 --> 00:54:16,179
think you put it together wrong. No I didn't. It's it's all this one. Tail. The tail is correct too.

268
00:54:19,179 --> 00:54:35,260
Got it. That. Why is it skin? Why is it flesh? This is not. It was scales wasn't it? This wasn't

269
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:48,980
part of his body. Weren't these different like armor plates? These were not just pieces of skin

270
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:59,059
with fat in them. Like a camel. Iguanodon. I don't even know what that is. Triceratops. We're going

271
00:54:59,059 --> 00:55:12,659
forward again. Triceratops. It didn't look like. I mean that. When I think of Triceratops this is

272
00:55:12,659 --> 00:55:29,000
what I see in my head. Like just big thick body. They're short. They're not tall. It is like this

273
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:45,610
but is the body bigger? No not that short. The body is right. No I know that's what I'm saying.

274
00:55:46,489 --> 00:56:12,730
This looks correct. It's the neck. Taller and thicker. No the neck. That's correct.

275
00:56:12,730 --> 00:56:21,300
The legs need to be longer. No this is a guy. This is a cat. That's not a Triceratops.

276
00:56:22,179 --> 00:56:47,880
It's definitely that one. Both legs wrong. There's no way.

277
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:14,230
No the body is. It's not the body. Look the body just gives you the starting point.

278
00:57:16,139 --> 00:57:28,199
This is the Triceratops body. Don't they have a low hanging neck? This is a goddamn. This is it.

279
00:57:31,610 --> 00:57:42,260
It's no it's not these ones. I gotta look up what I gotta see what a Triceratops looks like.

280
00:57:43,269 --> 00:57:55,159
I need to look it up right now. The neck needs to be longer. No it doesn't. Triceratops. What the

281
00:57:55,159 --> 00:58:03,880
fuck does a Triceratops look like? Like this. I had it right. This is correct. The head needs

282
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:14,500
to be up a little higher. Like right there. And then they had these these fat asses. These legs

283
00:58:14,579 --> 00:58:26,570
and then the tail is not that long. The Triceratops tail is not this long.

284
00:58:26,570 --> 00:59:00,920
The legs are two. There's only like three legs. Look at this. It's this not it. That's not it.

285
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:10,659
It's absolutely not these ones. It's not the neck. The neck is in the right spot.

286
00:59:10,659 --> 00:59:44,489
No this is wrong. That's not a Triceratops's body. A Triceratops's body doesn't go up this high.

287
00:59:44,489 --> 00:59:48,329
We were all wrong. Yeah everyone was screaming at me. You guys didn't even get it right either.

288
00:59:49,369 --> 01:00:06,139
I break Brachiosaurus. I don't I don't know what that. I know Brontosaurus. It's the same thing.

289
01:00:06,139 --> 01:00:22,389
Okay that's definitely correct. The hind legs. I think they're like this aren't they? Yeah they're

290
01:00:22,389 --> 01:00:32,340
big tall. They got kind of those the big legs. Look at the tail. How big are their arms? Aren't

291
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:46,380
they like usually that long? They have the big tails right? So what's missing here? The legs maybe?

292
01:00:46,940 --> 01:01:10,489
Like that maybe? Longer neck. Yeah the head doesn't look right. No the head is not correct.

293
01:01:10,489 --> 01:01:14,489
That's definitely not the right head. You're right. It's just one of these like weird ones.

294
01:01:14,489 --> 01:01:39,000
It's like the weird crocodile one. No it is that one. Okay so let's go back to this. All right so

295
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:58,710
now what is what else is wrong here? The neck. I think the neck is not right. Long legs. I'm not

296
01:01:58,710 --> 01:02:08,380
sure it's this neck. You guys are telling me it's this. I don't think it is. This looks pretty right.

297
01:02:24,219 --> 01:02:33,019
That okay that to me looks correct. There's only three options. Are they squished in together? They

298
01:02:33,019 --> 01:02:50,099
don't that long. Well it's definitely that what it has to be right? The body. If I change the body

299
01:02:50,099 --> 01:03:13,079
it's not going to be Brontosaurus anymore. Change neck. Change neck. That doesn't look right. You

300
01:03:13,079 --> 01:03:40,969
already tried that tail. Wrong forelimbs. It's not the prayer hands. Is it the prayer hands? They

301
01:03:40,969 --> 01:03:46,280
walked on all fours. Yeah that's what I'm saying. It's got to be like these two. It's either this

302
01:03:46,280 --> 01:04:02,250
one or this one. Is it the shorter ones or the the bigger the longer ones? So this is it. Neck

303
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:06,889
and tail are wrong. Well fight the 3,000 people that are screaming as loud as they can that I

304
01:04:06,889 --> 01:04:33,369
have the neck correct. Shorter tail. Now the neck. I'm not sure. Oh my god. I've just it was the

305
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:38,889
fucking neck. I knew it. I knew it. I told you guys the neck was wrong. I told you the neck was wrong

306
01:04:38,889 --> 01:04:43,849
and I was everybody yelled at me. They laughed at me. Said I was stupid. You're dumb. You're an idiot.

307
01:04:44,570 --> 01:04:55,239
The neck was fucking. I knew it. I was right. Everyone long neck. Big neck. Long neck.

308
01:05:05,449 --> 01:05:14,099
Somebody is overfeeding these things. But like I don't. And then the image in my brain when I

309
01:05:14,099 --> 01:05:27,219
think of like a Brontosaurus is not this. This looks like the Loch Ness monster picture that

310
01:05:27,219 --> 01:05:32,260
circled around. Like this is a person's arm. A hand arm and this is their shoulder and their head

311
01:05:32,260 --> 01:06:13,139
should be here. This is their other arm. Okay Iguanodon. Posture. Got that one easily. This

312
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:27,690
next one. Didn't even need to look. All right so this this is the head down here for me. This is

313
01:06:27,690 --> 01:06:32,570
the tail. I feel like this is standing this way and it's head is like slumped down lying down.

314
01:06:32,570 --> 01:06:45,860
It's sleeping. That's how they sleep. I did it. That was tough but I'm glad I boned up on

315
01:06:45,860 --> 01:06:50,019
paleontology before I came down here. I wonder if the dinosaur exhibits are in any better shape.

316
01:06:50,019 --> 01:07:17,380
Maybe I should take a look. Now that's what I call a tyrant lizard. This thing alive? Quick stab it.

317
01:07:19,349 --> 01:07:34,309
Um Tyrannosaurus Rex. Don't care. It's a pug now. That Iguanodon looks a little like my math teacher.

318
01:07:34,309 --> 01:07:47,320
I wonder if he can do three plays multiplication in his little brain. Right. Didn't know the

319
01:07:47,320 --> 01:08:00,070
Brachiosaurus was so tall. I wonder what was kept in that bump on its head. This is one long

320
01:08:00,070 --> 01:08:13,349
dinosaur. I bet she would make a great waterslide if you could get her to stand still. Those three

321
01:08:13,349 --> 01:08:21,220
horns look dangerous. I'll bet he could play fullback for any team he wanted. No they don't

322
01:08:21,220 --> 01:08:30,979
do anything. The Stegosaurus was probably a nice guy but I wouldn't want him to get mad and hit me

323
01:08:30,979 --> 01:08:35,859
with that spiked tail. This is fun but I still have work to do if I'm gonna get this whole museum

324
01:08:35,859 --> 01:08:40,659
put back together. These guys are dynamite but I should hustle back to the main hall and see if

325
01:08:40,659 --> 01:08:47,050
anything else is falling apart. What was the point of me walking down here? All right that was fun.

326
01:08:47,050 --> 01:09:02,899
That was easy. Ocean life. All of animal habitats. All of ecology. The earth's geology. Prehistoric

327
01:09:02,899 --> 01:09:08,739
people. The development of writing. Knights, heraldry, and jousting. Galileo's telescope

328
01:09:08,739 --> 01:09:14,649
or industrial revolution. Solar system. How big is the universe? The solar system. All right

329
01:09:14,649 --> 01:09:30,619
everyone wants to do it. Sure nobody's gonna read any of this. Look at all the stars. I love looking

330
01:09:30,619 --> 01:09:35,659
at that night sky. Makes me think about how large the universe is and how small we are. Also makes

331
01:09:35,659 --> 01:09:38,939
me think about a t-shirt that I could possibly purchase if I really cared about having one of

332
01:09:38,939 --> 01:09:44,899
those from the you do acclimation point t-shirts. The sky looks peaceful enough but I'm sure

333
01:09:44,899 --> 01:09:50,550
something must be wrong or we wouldn't be here. Warning computer analysis has determined that

334
01:09:50,550 --> 01:09:56,149
stars in projection dome do not match star at the settings. Uh-oh there's the main computer's voice.

335
01:09:56,149 --> 01:10:01,590
It probably means something bad's about to happen. Warning warning program overload cannot resolve

336
01:10:01,590 --> 01:10:06,470
out of place star data. System shutdown sequence initiated star data will be purged from system in

337
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:11,829
60 minutes. Yes that means I have to find a way to put those stars back where they belong. I always

338
01:10:11,829 --> 01:10:16,789
wanted to save the world but saving the universe is a little much. Maybe I should check with Nick.

339
01:10:16,789 --> 01:10:24,859
He usually has some good info. What does this thing look like? Like an ion cannon? I don't understand.

340
01:10:26,039 --> 01:10:32,600
Is this like a death star? What do you mean purge the stars? This is the planetarium projection

341
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:42,220
room. The celestial projector shows the stars as they actually appear in the night sky. Okay the

342
01:10:42,220 --> 01:10:45,180
projector's program has been corrupted by the virus and the five stars are out of place.

343
01:10:45,979 --> 01:10:52,520
Oh and only five are out of I was gonna say there's only five. When the projection system tried to

344
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:57,479
correct the locations of these stars it caused a program overload. All the data will be lost

345
01:10:57,479 --> 01:11:05,000
forever if the stars are not put back in their proper location. Use the information in the star

346
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:22,649
atlas to reprogram the projector and put the stars back where they belong. What the fuck do you want me to do?

347
01:11:24,649 --> 01:11:28,329
This looks like the sky in the planetarium but something tells me that it's not quite the same.

348
01:11:29,289 --> 01:11:34,619
If I'm correct I should be able to get some information about the stars from the screen.

349
01:11:34,619 --> 01:11:50,090
Maybe I can use the info to put the stars back where they belong. Blue blue green frog

350
01:11:51,819 --> 01:12:00,579
uh light green orange pink red what does that tell me though I don't get it

351
01:12:00,579 --> 01:12:50,090
8 26 1991 okay 8 26 1991 uh new game 40 260 this is cool though I don't hate this

352
01:12:51,449 --> 01:12:58,550
it's a fun game I don't get what this stuff is for though radio wave infrared spectrum like

353
01:12:59,109 --> 01:13:11,340
how do I I mean that's correct day everything project it's right there

354
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:33,289
put your birthday in it's time for you guys to pick where we go

355
01:13:36,869 --> 01:13:47,579
this is where we were I believe at the end of no I think we were further down no we were right here

356
01:13:47,579 --> 01:13:58,420
right like here oh no the bar we did the bard's tail right yeah I remember the bard's tail

357
01:13:58,420 --> 01:14:07,210
pizza tycoon's right there yeah this looks right all right in just a moment you'll be able to click

358
01:14:07,210 --> 01:14:28,489
on the screen and please do right now wayne's world wizardry proving grounds of the mad

359
01:14:30,659 --> 01:14:40,899
uh it seems to be unanimous wayne's world this is gonna be just a side scroller

360
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:46,060
but you have a slingshot and you have to do you're in like a living room and jumping over stuff and

361
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:51,020
it's like a guitar power up that you pick up for points I already know what this game is but we're

362
01:14:51,020 --> 01:15:08,819
gonna play it like every game back in like the 80s and 90s it was based on a tv show or a movie

363
01:15:08,819 --> 01:15:27,239
was always a side scroller let's see how that is capstone

364
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:31,369
pinnacle of entertainment software

365
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:56,140
don't think I remember this watch that be it

366
01:15:59,369 --> 01:16:07,960
next disc we're not mental or anything so don't be afraid they have whole voice

367
01:16:14,279 --> 01:16:18,859
that's it that's all they just did one line oh it's just pulled audio

368
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:30,659
uh where you the viewer can express your opinions about babes oh okay yeah or perhaps videos

369
01:16:31,539 --> 01:16:40,439
or even garth's yeah or whatever you want to talk about okay oh first caller hi my name is c

370
01:16:41,079 --> 01:16:46,140
l elvis i'm the local community access program reviewer what do you think of our show well

371
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:51,500
that's why i called first of all i think that uh the wayne's world logo should rotate counter

372
01:16:51,500 --> 01:17:01,590
clockwise instead of clockwise that would double our ratings not not also since i think that garth

373
01:17:01,590 --> 01:17:07,529
should be left-handed it will add to certain symmetry sorry chump no can do garth nodded his

374
01:17:07,529 --> 01:17:14,010
right mind are you mental get the net finally i think that those interruption things that happen

375
01:17:14,010 --> 01:17:20,970
during the show should be taken out they distract the viewer you mean the commercials do you know

376
