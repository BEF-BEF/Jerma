1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:08,619
Holy shit, he's early. Yeah, very early. There's a reason for that though.

2
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:13,050
There's always a reason for it, and these are the reasons why.

3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:24,760
It is 12 p.m. Pacific. I'm awake. I'm kind of back on an incredibly early sleep schedule and

4
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:33,960
I went to the doctor yesterday. I didn't mean to be on this schedule, but I went to the

5
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:42,250
doctor yesterday and had some blood work done, and they took like seven vials of blood,

6
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:48,359
and I was like, well, I'm getting a little fucking lightheaded. I came home and I just fell asleep.

7
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:59,219
I like went right to bed, and I woke up with like 4 30 in the morning. So I mean,

8
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:11,219
come on, we're here, right? Blood talk? I mean, it was in the vial, so you didn't

9
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:17,560
have to touch the blood. You just have to know it was there. So I'm going to go over a few things

10
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:23,909
that are very important, and they include all of you. Well, maybe not all of you,

11
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:32,280
but a large portion of you. So give me a minute. I will be right back and we can get

12
00:01:32,280 --> 00:02:35,060
started. Okay, see you in a second. What the fuck are you guys saying? This guy's too early.

13
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:44,439
Yeah, I mean, don't expect streams like this to happen all the time, but I was blood

14
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:53,379
tired last night. I'm not going to be blood tired every day. They took too much of my blood,

15
00:02:53,379 --> 00:03:03,530
and then they made me really tired. That sounds really fucked up. But tonight,

16
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,969
or today, or today, it's not even tonight. Maybe it's tonight for some of you guys.

17
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:11,289
We're gonna play Hotline Miami 2. I'm going to try to finish it. I have a fresh take on it.

18
00:03:12,169 --> 00:03:18,409
It kicked the shit out of me a couple days ago. But I said I was going to persevere,

19
00:03:18,409 --> 00:03:24,889
and I was going to try my hardest to beat it. And even if we don't, let's just say I get to

20
00:03:24,889 --> 00:03:31,110
a portion of the game where I can't do it, and I'm going to freak out. It's all right,

21
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:38,409
because there's also I got a bunch of community workshop levels as well. I got a little

22
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:43,930
sampling of workshop levels to check out. So if it does get to a point where it's just

23
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:53,539
not completable for me, we'll be good. So let's talk about... No, not yet. Not yet.

24
00:03:53,539 --> 00:04:00,819
I'm gonna wait for most people to be here, because it's about Christmas. It's about the

25
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:09,419
Christmas Eve stream that is happening, and it's going to involve you guys. Do it now.

26
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:15,080
All right. You know, fine. Fuck it. We'll do it now. How about we wait? Now do it now.

27
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:23,259
So let's start by saying that there's going to be a live stream on Christmas Eve. That's

28
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:30,810
December 24th. The stream is going to be at some point in the afternoon Pacific,

29
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:39,240
probably like early evening. I'd say around maybe probably like three to four p.m. Pacific

30
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,920
time is when it'll probably start. And it's going to be a Christmas slash Halloween

31
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:51,220
extravaganza, because I missed a Halloween stream. I typically like to do Halloween

32
00:04:51,220 --> 00:05:02,629
themed streams. So we're going to do both. And at the apex kind of the climax of the night

33
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:08,470
is going to involve you guys doing some stuff. And what does that mean? Well, there's going

34
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:16,019
to be a secret Santa chat gives me presents portion of the stream. Remember how a week or

35
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:21,540
so ago we talked about, man, wouldn't it be funny if chat, I just let them kind of decide what

36
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:29,699
to buy on Amazon? Well, what a perfect time to do that. So there is a channel. There's a channel

37
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:35,620
in the Discord called Secret Santa suggestions. What you're going to do in that channel is

38
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:47,370
you're going to give suggestions of what you would like to give me for Christmas.

39
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:54,410
And from those suggestions, they will be selections. The moderators are going to be

40
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:59,899
selecting. So there's no voting. There's no nominations or anything like that.

41
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:05,589
It's just suggestions the mods are going to be taking from that channel are then I'm going to

42
00:06:05,589 --> 00:06:11,959
buy them. But I'm not going to know, because I'm going to have Kim is going to buy them for

43
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:20,170
me. And then she's going to wrap them. And I am going to have no fucking idea what they are.

44
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:29,379
And I'm going to open them on stream. So there are some criteria involved in this,

45
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:39,540
you could probably imagine. No, let's go over them right now. You want me to talk about it. So

46
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:49,110
let's talk about it. They will absolutely, absolutely no living creatures. So oh, that's

47
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:56,540
right. Let's let let's put on the list of 50,000 ants. Oh, no, no, no. Your suggestion has

48
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:04,089
to be under no more than $50. So we're talking zero to $50 is what your suggestion

49
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:12,300
can be. It has to be an Amazon link and it has to be prime ready. So has to be an Amazon link,

50
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:21,990
has to be prime ready, has to be under $50. But the channel, what happened to the channel?

51
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:41,689
Is it not there? The channel is gone. No, it's here. The channel is gone. No, it's here.

52
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:53,220
It should be okay now. So by the way, in that channel, please do not, that's not a chat

53
00:07:53,220 --> 00:08:00,629
channel, by the way, not a chat channel, not a chat channel. Wait, no, don't do that. Oh,

54
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:05,509
wait, wait, should I? Wait, okay, but I'm gonna I'm gonna disable those permissions for a second.

55
00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:12,600
Let me explain this. Listen. Okay. So everybody just jumped in there and fucking started

56
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:19,540
spamming. Let me explain the rules before you do anything crazy. So in remember, that is not

57
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:25,459
a chat channel. That is a suggestion channel. And you are only allowed three suggestions per

58
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:32,950
person and the bonds are going to be very strict on this. Okay, it's a chat channel. We get it.

59
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:42,809
You know, that channel is a chat channel. Read the spam that got in. Okay. No, no, no, no, no,

60
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:53,590
no, I'm not. I'm not. Because I don't I don't want to give any opinions. I don't want to

61
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:58,629
know what you guys are going to have me buy. And that's that's the thing. I'm going to be

62
00:08:58,629 --> 00:09:07,450
opening presents that I'm purchasing, sending to myself, wrapped up from you guys. Because

63
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:10,570
think about that. And people say, well, he's buying his own Christmas presents. What an ego

64
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:16,070
maniac. Am I though? You know, you guys subscribe to this channel, you guys give money to this

65
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:22,919
channel. Be sure that it's not you guys with your suggestion. He's a fucking psycho.

66
00:09:28,169 --> 00:09:34,250
What like an ego maniac. That's right. I want to open a present. These are presents to me.

67
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:39,480
But I did mention that I want to do it. And the maximum money is going to be 500 bucks.

68
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:46,220
So there's not going to be a shitload of if you so by the way, knowing that,

69
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:51,299
and the mods are going to have full discretion here. Oh, I have an idea for a present. How

70
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:59,960
about like a $499 vibe? Don't do that. It has to be under 50 bucks. The lower I mean,

71
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:04,200
you could make it a good suggestion if it's higher in price, because that gives you more

72
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:09,000
of a, you know, reason why it would be picked. That'll be a fun idea. And that's just

73
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:24,220
one portion of the stream on Christmas Eve. A $50 fake vibe. Metal Socks just gave 50 bucks

74
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:31,899
right now. Thank you so much, Metal Socks. They say, Hey, Jeremy, I haven't been able to

75
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:35,820
haven't been catching up the streams. Works pushing me hard, but watching the

76
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,500
VODs and the second channel stuff really made this whole year for me. I hope you know that

77
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:46,860
I hope you and all have a happy December wean and a happy new yard. Well, thank you,

78
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:58,200
Metal Socks. That's big money. Thank you. Can we donate bits towards a bigger Christmas budget?

79
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:10,600
No, no, no. $500 is it. That's it. No, no bigger Christmas budget. By the way,

80
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:17,879
because of the short notice here, that channel suggestions are only going to be able to be put

81
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:23,080
in that channel until tomorrow, tomorrow evening. You know, essentially like a little

82
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:29,539
bit more than 24 hours from now because I have to get them here. So if you have a suggestion

83
00:11:29,539 --> 00:11:33,220
and you got a good one, make sure you get it in there. Make sure it's an Amazon prime

84
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:39,289
link, a link to an Amazon product that is prime shippable. Otherwise I'm not going

85
00:11:39,289 --> 00:11:49,000
to be able to get it here in time. Don't tell me, don't give me any ideas. I don't

86
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:59,240
want to see any of these. If you got a good, if you got a good one, get it in there.

87
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:06,440
Why not a bigger budget than $500? Because I don't know, I didn't want to be sitting there

88
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,980
opening like 60 Christmas presents. You know how fucked up that would be?

89
00:12:13,539 --> 00:12:19,450
Hey, well, Merry Christmas to me. Here's like 75 Christmas presents. That's just like,

90
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:30,360
that's like next level. Can it be eBay? It cannot. It has to be on Amazon. No animals,

91
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:37,399
no live creatures, no parrot. Listen, no perishable food items. If your item is perishable,

92
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:42,889
do not link it in that. It's not going to get used. No sexual shit. I don't even have to say

93
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:47,750
the D word. You know what I'm saying? Like no, none of that. That's not going to get taken.

94
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:03,240
Boring. No, it's called, I don't want to get in fucking trouble. I'm going to be in the

95
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:08,600
studio guys. You want to send me like 20,000 ants and have me open it and be like, oh,

96
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:20,899
and have the ants go all over the fucking studio. I'm going to be fucked. Yes. Oh yeah.

97
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:34,620
That would be real fun. If you have fun with it, don't send me any fucked up shit. What do

98
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:41,669
you mean don't send me? I'm buying these things through the Kim, the proxy, and then she's going

99
00:13:41,669 --> 00:13:49,669
to wrap them and I'm not allowed to see them. Do you not trust us mods? No, of course I do.

100
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:58,809
All right. With that being said, let's move on. Hopefully you got enough information there.

101
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:14,090
I don't trust the mods. Thank you KXE for the 30 bucks. Oh shit. EU German stream.

102
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:19,129
Excellent way to celebrate turning 30. Hope you have a Merry Christmas friend. Hashtag charity.

103
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:28,500
Happy 30. That's a big number. That's a big milestone to get over. Thank you for the 30

104
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:41,289
dollars. Now I've been stalling enough because this game beat the absolute shit out of me.

105
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:52,389
I think I've felt, I think I felt worse. Yeah, I'm not sure. I may have like felt worse

106
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:57,909
after being mad at Hotline Miami 2 than I was after seven vials of blood being removed from

107
00:14:57,909 --> 00:15:02,870
my body yesterday. I don't know which made me feel more uncomfortable. I don't know. That's a

108
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:23,830
tough one. What song is this? Oh, I'm actually not sure. Buy more blood. Bloodborne gamer? No,

109
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:29,299
not blood. I had, I had a lot of blood work done yesterday. All right, so we're gonna go

110
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:43,259
123456789. Where were we? We were at number 20. Release. I wish I could drink Jerma's blood.

111
00:15:47,419 --> 00:15:54,220
I wish you wouldn't. I wish that you wouldn't do that. Why did I read that? All right,

112
00:15:54,220 --> 00:16:01,740
I gotta be like calm and collected. I gotta be ready and I'm gonna complete this. I was very,

113
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:10,090
very upset. This music is very loud. I'm gonna, okay, hold on. This is distracting me already.

114
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:22,409
No, that's all right. Okay, here we go. I think I remember, yeah, I remember this part. This guy

115
00:16:22,409 --> 00:16:31,480
chases you around. I have, why did I have to start at the very beginning here? All my muscle

116
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:40,600
memory is gone too. This is gonna be a disaster. This is gonna be a fucking disaster.

117
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:54,389
I already know. All right, I got it. We're good. What happened to the, what's with the

118
00:16:54,389 --> 00:17:00,549
audio? What the heck happened to the audio? All right, now I remember this part. You walk

119
00:17:00,549 --> 00:17:07,769
through here and I'm gonna die right now because I don't remember. No, I do. Oh, that guy has a

120
00:17:07,769 --> 00:17:19,700
gun. All right. Oh boy. That's one, two, three, four. Windows everywhere. Does that guy have a

121
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:32,789
gun? That guy's got a gun. Two guys with guns. Anybody, who else? That guy, that guy, that guy.

122
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:40,660
All right, I gotta watch out. Old god. Why is he not coming after me? Why is that guy not

123
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:52,279
coming after me? He just shot me and didn't care. Somebody please come after me. I don't want to go

124
00:17:52,279 --> 00:18:07,509
in those rooms. It's just death. What the fuck? Why won't he come out here? He did come out here.

125
00:18:07,509 --> 00:18:17,400
Okay, he came out that time. Is he not, okay, what about this guy in there? I wonder if I

126
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:23,779
can hit this door and throw it at this guy. That's what I'm gonna try to do. Okay, I'm

127
00:18:23,779 --> 00:18:27,299
gonna knock that guy out of the door, throw a crowbar at this guy's face, break that guy's

128
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:29,619
neck, shoot him in the face, and then throw the, I don't even know. I don't know what I'm

129
00:18:29,619 --> 00:18:41,740
gonna do. Perfect. Okay, I did it, but what did I do? Is there anybody else? I think I got that

130
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:51,859
guy in there already. Okay. Damn it! I wasn't trying, I was trying to hit that guy. Fuck!

131
00:18:52,500 --> 00:19:03,930
I was trying to hit the guy with, the guy with the fucking gun. Not this dumb ass. Good,

132
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:09,430
come out here. All right, that's the only guy with the gun. These guys have to

133
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:14,470
worry about those two. Can I pull them? Whoa. Oh god. That was so many of them. I gotta

134
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:27,609
throw this thing down. You know another thing I don't like about this place?

135
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:32,460
It's like the lighting. The fact that it gets like that dark and then the red.

136
00:19:33,339 --> 00:20:15,160
Get over here. Dear lord. Okay, pull this guy out here and go up. Come on, why are you

137
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:32,309
not chasing after me? Shouldn't he be running out here? Oh god. Okay, just gonna deal with

138
00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:39,690
this guy and then I get a gun and we can do it again. All right, here we go. Don't fuck

139
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:45,029
it up. Come on Jeremy, don't fuck this up. Wait, somebody has a gun. Somebody has a gun.

140
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:57,960
Give me that gun. What? He doesn't hear that? There's a guy with a pistol. There he is.

141
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:06,619
Okay, here we go. He can shoot me through the walls but so can I. Bingo. Give me the new

142
00:21:06,619 --> 00:21:20,150
gun. Nobody else, right? I'm so paranoid. You know, it would be nice. Why did that take so

143
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:42,599
long? Okay, no gun. Gun, gun, gun. One guy left. That's it. Please, please have this be the last

144
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:47,509
guy on this floor. I can't see all the way up there though. I think it is. I'm going for it.

145
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:52,539
Holy shit, I just got so scared. I thought there was a guy right there but it was a

146
00:21:52,539 --> 00:22:21,380
fucking plant. Okay, here we go. Got it. He's back baby. Give me the gun. Give me the gun.

147
00:22:27,259 --> 00:22:40,380
This is so sloppy. I got to get this fucking gun out of here, man. Oh yeah, yeah.

148
00:22:50,839 --> 00:23:03,529
Fuck. No, well, I wanted to shoot you. I'm so confused here. Am I like picking up the gun

149
00:23:03,529 --> 00:23:10,490
without right clicking? Hold on a second. I'm really confused. I'm running over this gun

150
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:20,940
and it's picking up. Like, I'm not hitting right click. Am I out of my mind? Oh boy,

151
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:38,470
all right. What do we got? Fuck. Okay, I think I was going to... Got it. Okay,

152
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:49,299
now wait for this one guy. Give me this gun, please. That one, I think. Who's left? All

153
00:23:49,299 --> 00:24:02,869
right, we got a ton of people down there. Gun. Got it. Anybody else? Gun. Got it. Oh my

154
00:24:02,869 --> 00:24:06,630
god, there's a people in there. Fuck, I forgot about the people in that room. God damn

155
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:23,289
it. Oh my god, there's some people in there. What the hell was that? And I told myself today,

156
00:24:23,289 --> 00:24:28,329
listen guys, I said I was going to be fucking calm. I wasn't going to freak out. I was going

157
00:24:28,329 --> 00:24:40,900
to be very, very careful. I'm okay. I got this. Everything's fine. I said I was going to be

158
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:44,579
cautious. I was not going to freak out. I was going to be very, very collected today.

159
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:53,369
I think so far I've been okay. You know what I'm saying? What do you guys think? I've

160
00:24:53,369 --> 00:25:00,380
been pretty calm and collected. Tons of... Oh, I didn't want to shoot. I just accidentally

161
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:04,359
shot that guy. All right, give me another gun. I don't have... There's no other guns here.

162
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:15,910
Sir, could you... There's another gun. All right. Right, what's happening? What's that?

163
00:25:18,329 --> 00:25:22,730
What? I don't understand why I don't... Jeremy, don't do it. But I don't understand

164
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:28,789
why. I don't understand. I don't understand why it was locked on and I couldn't get the

165
00:25:28,789 --> 00:25:34,069
lock on to come back. I don't... I don't understand. I'm infuriated right now. Stop it.

166
00:25:34,069 --> 00:25:36,789
It's all right. Everything's going to be fine. Just pick up the gun on the ground.

167
00:25:37,349 --> 00:25:40,069
Don't worry about it. Just think about it. It's like Christmas time. You know what

168
00:25:40,069 --> 00:25:50,059
I mean? Like, isn't that nice? Christmas is fucking nice. The holidays are here.

169
00:25:51,380 --> 00:26:08,980
You know? I didn't get more than one... He's dead? All right. There's people down

170
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:14,019
there and that door is open. So I got to get in here. I got to shoot one guy.

171
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:28,869
That guy got a gun? I just fucking panicked. What the hell are you doing, Jeremy? What have

172
00:26:28,869 --> 00:26:42,119
I done? It's ruined. No, it's not. I got a gun right here. Fucking door. All right.

173
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:45,000
It's just this guy with this pistol. I'm going to go down here. I'm safe.

174
00:26:46,869 --> 00:27:02,119
That's it. Okay. Just wait for... That guy's dead in that room. Okay. One bullet. No,

175
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:13,430
it's too risky. Uh, give me something else. It's too risky. Told you it was risky.

176
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:19,930
See? Nobody else is alive. Come on. I was told this is like the hardest level in the

177
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:47,559
game. That's what my horoscope said this morning. That's it. Oh, I almost died. Okay.

178
00:27:48,119 --> 00:28:01,099
Get changed. This level is where I quit for six months. Six months. That's a long time.

179
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:13,500
Who the hell is this guy? Is this guy Duck? What? I... I don't understand this guy. He

180
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:24,900
Ducked. Does he... What? What am I supposed to do about this guy? I guess just avoid him?

181
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:35,130
Okay. What do I do about the Duck guy? There's a bunch of Duck guys.

182
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:52,009
Melee? Huh. Well, there's a melee here. Let's see if this theory works.

183
00:28:54,019 --> 00:29:02,259
Ooh. All right. So they... I can't shoot these guys. Oh my god, he's running so fast.

184
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:14,039
Oh, I didn't know they... Holy fuck. I like how... I need to like crack my fingers for a

185
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:26,410
second. They like hurt my chest. I could... Come on. Get over here. He doesn't see me?

186
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:39,769
This guy's gonna see me. Give me a gun. What the fuck? What just happened?

187
00:29:39,769 --> 00:29:58,099
I went through every single window. It didn't hit anybody. Okay. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh

188
00:29:58,099 --> 00:30:02,180
my god. What do I do? I need a melee weapon. I need a melee weapon. I need a melee weapon.

189
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:16,680
Knife. Knife. Punch. What happened? Okay. We're fine. No more guns? I think this guy

190
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:23,099
just has a... My guy just has a bayonet. See through, but it's okay. Just pull this guy out.

191
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:30,200
That guy can see through here. Oh! Okay, we're fine. There's another guy there.

192
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:53,099
How do I get rid of this guy? Oh, like this. Got it. God. What? I was... What am I even

193
00:30:53,099 --> 00:31:05,529
saying? I'm trying... It's not over. There's more to do. Oh. Cafeteria or something? No

194
00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:21,900
guns. Why use the shotgun when I can just go like this? I didn't get the combo. That's

195
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:27,819
all right. Whatever. Pull this guy. All right. There's another big guy. Get the gun.

196
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:45,349
Okay. Big guy. I mean like, whoa, you got big guy. All right. We got a psycho though. I got

197
00:31:45,349 --> 00:31:52,619
a... All right. This is the plan. Shoot. Grab melee. Hit guy. Or shoot, throw, punch. Right?

198
00:31:53,259 --> 00:32:09,240
What do I do? Did he come? Is he over here? He has a gun? I thought that... No. I thought

199
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:17,130
that was one of those... Oh, what? I thought that was one of those crazy guys that...

200
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:29,609
Fucking hell. Oh, that made... Like why... Why are you doing that when you have a gun?

201
00:32:30,329 --> 00:32:35,559
Is there a reason for that? That made me extremely upset. I'm upset right now.

202
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:40,119
You're just going to sit there and pound on his face and you just have a shotgun in your

203
00:32:40,119 --> 00:33:10,819
pocket. No, I didn't have any bullets. Taking the gun with me. That guy's got a gun. Just pull

204
00:33:10,819 --> 00:33:24,250
him if I can. Actually, shoot him. All right. Let's try this again. I need that one shot here

205
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:35,589
for him. All right. This guy has a gun. Oh, fuck. What am I going to do about that? Okay.

206
00:33:36,309 --> 00:33:49,880
Well, I have to kill this guy. Fuck. Okay. I gotta run in there. No, I don't. Huh. Okay.

207
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:57,240
All right. I have to throw a knife at somebody's head. All right. Here we go. Knife this guy

208
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:02,630
right in the face. No, knife this guy right in the face. Wait, there's a pistol? Pistol?

209
00:34:03,269 --> 00:34:11,320
Does it have bullets? Did I... Oh, there it is. You know, what would I do without you guys?

210
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:17,019
What would I do without you guys? What the hell would I even do without you?

211
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:26,340
What? I'm pan... What happened? What? That's not a door. What? Why did this not open? What?

212
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:35,860
What? What? Why did the door not... I walked right into it. I don't understand. What the

213
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:42,869
fuck did I just do? No, no, no, no, no. What? What the fuck did I just do? Did I just go back?

214
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:54,139
I just press... No fucking way. You gotta be kidding me. Really? That that just actually

215
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:58,170
happened? When you're in the middle of a level, you just... It's that easy to go all

216
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:16,780
the way to the beginning? No way. You gotta be fucking kidding me. What? No, no. Not even

217
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:20,300
like a confirmation, right? What? It's just like, now you're at the beginning again.

218
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:29,539
What? I'm so fucking mad right now. I can't believe it. That was like on floor three or four.

219
00:35:29,539 --> 00:35:42,280
If I was on the first floor, I would understand, but why? There's no way to

220
00:35:42,280 --> 00:36:02,820
undo that. And why did the music get so quiet? Yeah, I guess I just accidentally

221
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:11,269
restarted the entire thing. Now I gotta do this all over again. What the fuck?

222
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:34,630
Okay. Well, I think I'm so upset by that that I like, I don't even know what to do.

223
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:41,349
I'm going to do it again, but I'm, I'm so like annoyed by what just happened that I can't even

224
00:36:41,349 --> 00:36:45,909
give you a reaction and I'm just going to play. Let's go. Base cam. All right. Fine.

225
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:07,670
End of the stream voice. Somebody wrote, I would quit for six months over that.

226
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:13,340
No, I, but I'm, I'm all right though. I've, I figured these levels out before

227
00:37:14,059 --> 00:37:19,849
as a list. Go ahead and just don't get so upset that you can't just have no emotion right now.

228
00:37:19,849 --> 00:37:33,559
This guy with gun, what else is over here? Give me another weapon. I gotta be ready for

229
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:37,159
this. I'm going to pull people into the bathroom. I didn't even know there was a way

230
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:42,840
to go in there. Oh, come on. I didn't even know there was a way to go down there.

231
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:47,639
Why did it rewind? No, it's coming out. Why did it rewind all the way without a confirmation?

232
00:37:48,659 --> 00:37:51,300
What's what's what's with the cotton? No, no confirmation.

233
00:38:04,409 --> 00:38:10,199
I can't believe it. I can't fucking believe it. Oh, no, I can't just relax.

234
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:25,989
I didn't even know they could go through there. Get in here. You

235
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:45,269
did this. Stop it. Just do it. Just I can't fucking, why would that even be an option?

236
00:39:06,059 --> 00:39:20,949
I'm so fucking mad. I need to relax, man. I seriously need to relax. I'm gonna like

237
00:39:20,949 --> 00:39:26,789
eat my microphone. But I'm, I might not sound that upset, but deep down and inside of like

238
00:39:26,789 --> 00:39:35,289
my fucking veins, this is like when the evil villain is so dangerous and so terrifying and

239
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:43,130
somebody makes fun of him or slights him and he doesn't look upset. He's very collected and

240
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:49,050
he's just sitting there like, Oh, yes. Isn't that an interesting thing you said? And he's

241
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:53,449
so collected about it. But deep down, you know, you know that what he's he's planning.

242
00:39:54,090 --> 00:40:03,190
He's planning to eat his microphone when he goes home. That guy doesn't have a gun.

243
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:12,010
I don't want him to see me. All right. Let's I gotta run up on this guy and get him.

244
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:18,219
Run up on him and get him. I can write. I know I can give me that gun. All right.

245
00:40:19,019 --> 00:40:26,820
It's time to guns. No, I'm not going to do this yet. Yes, I am. I already did it.

246
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:40,059
Got it. Okay. I got it with one shot. Thank you. It's that easy. We're fine. Oh,

247
00:40:40,059 --> 00:40:46,280
fuck. That's still going. Right. I'm, I still have to do this whole thing again, too.

248
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:03,099
I think that like when I, when I know that I, I'm just like fucking angry

249
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:09,190
and it's making me play at a level that I've never even seen before. Okay.

250
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:15,860
So we're good. Two guys up there with a gun. Anybody down there? I don't think there is.

251
00:41:17,539 --> 00:41:20,820
Nope. Gun, gun. Let's go ahead and pull.

252
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:47,539
Of course that guy's still alive. Give me a break. That guy hit himself in the

253
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:53,449
fucking head with the door. I don't, I don't like the shotgun.

254
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:59,349
I seriously don't like the shotgun at all. It just causes fucking problems.

255
00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:27,929
All right. Give me. Got them both. Yes. That guy can probably see me. Does that have,

256
00:42:27,929 --> 00:42:31,989
that guy have line of sight on me? All right. Only guy with the gun right here.

257
00:42:36,219 --> 00:42:47,500
Oh boy. Right. Give me this one. Very close to being exactly where we were and

258
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:56,809
deleted a bunch of fucking time for no reason. Wiser rewind. Give me that.

259
00:42:56,809 --> 00:43:05,380
All right. These guys both have, that guy has a gun. That guy up there has a gun. Did I get

260
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:11,139
the guy over here? It was two, right? This guy in the bathroom. All right. I'm going to say

261
00:43:11,139 --> 00:43:17,800
I'm going bathroom. Oh my fucking God. What have I done? I saw the guy behind me.

262
00:43:19,510 --> 00:44:01,860
Oh my fucking God. I can't, I don't, I did it already. Oh, that's it up there. Okay. Give me

263
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:13,619
the pistol. No, fuck the pistol. Explain it. I want a full written report of what happened

264
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:23,750
there. All right. Now we got these two. Didn't hear that. I guess. Fine. You fucking can't be

265
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:47,559
serious. Oh my fucking God. I can't fucking believe it. Just give me a weapon. Any of

266
00:44:47,559 --> 00:45:02,070
them that had bullets. Is he dead? Did the door hit him or is he dead? I don't know.

267
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:11,579
I think he's dead. The guy with the gun right here. I'm trying to fucking shoot the guy behind

268
00:45:11,579 --> 00:45:18,039
him. What the, why? He knocked him down and he, I still shot him with the shotgun

269
00:45:18,039 --> 00:45:28,019
and he absorbed every single fucking pellet. Just never forget, never forget that I did,

270
00:45:28,099 --> 00:46:08,889
I pressed enter on this and almost did it again. Press R to reload. Can I pick, please? Anything,

271
00:46:08,889 --> 00:46:14,840
please? Can you just go back to pick a chapter? No, it starts at the very beginning.

272
00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:39,659
Damn it. These guys, that guy has a gun. What the fuck was that? All right. I need

273
00:46:39,659 --> 00:46:43,780
something here. All right. This time I can't let that happen again. I got to get back to

274
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:54,809
where I just was. I don't think these, any of these have, no, no bullets at all.

275
00:46:54,809 --> 00:47:04,300
I'm in trouble. I guess I could throw, nobody has a gun over here. Yeah,

276
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:23,699
they do. Shit. I have to pull this guy in here. Give me your gun. Okay. Can we please try this

277
00:47:23,699 --> 00:47:38,969
again? Without like a total disaster. All right. How did I even get shot by that guy?

278
00:47:38,969 --> 00:47:46,519
This guy was, what the heck happened? All right. This crunch time here. Get it done.

279
00:47:46,519 --> 00:47:52,730
For the love of God. That, kill that guy last. Because there's two, there's a pistol

280
00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:57,929
on the ground there. He's done, nobody has line of sight. All right. Here we go.

281
00:47:58,489 --> 00:48:06,599
I got to make this happen. What the fuck is you doing over here? What are you doing over here?

282
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:19,559
What do you think you're doing over here? What are you doing over here?

283
00:48:21,699 --> 00:48:30,900
All right. Finally. Don't press escape ever again. My heart is racing right now. No,

284
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:34,659
I already did this too, didn't I? Did I already, where's my fucking character? What the

285
00:48:34,659 --> 00:48:59,539
fuck? What? All right. But by the way, when I press R, why doesn't R go now? Who's left? Oh boy. Oh

286
00:48:59,539 --> 00:49:09,320
boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. When there's somebody up here, I got like collapsed on by somebody before

287
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:22,010
this guy. I need a melee. That's it, right? Somebody else ran after me before. I remember

288
00:49:22,010 --> 00:49:30,980
distinctly. Fuck. Somebody came after me with, I need to get a melee. Give me a reliable

289
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:49,659
melee. I don't even know who's down there. Nobody has a gun. That guy. I knew I saw,

290
00:49:49,659 --> 00:49:58,070
I knew he was coming. This guy has a gun. Nobody in this room. Just this guy here. Come on.

291
00:49:58,070 --> 00:50:10,360
You can see me. Get over here. How do you not see me? Jesus, man. Don't go in there.

292
00:50:11,159 --> 00:50:22,500
Don't go in there. Just wait. Fuck. Come on. I don't, I don't want to go in there yet.

293
00:50:24,070 --> 00:50:42,789
Oh, he almost did it. He almost did it to me. Last guy. Now we're back. Kill them. I know.

294
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:55,139
I'm trying. It's just very nerve wracking. This is where I was before it. No. Actually,

295
00:50:55,139 --> 00:51:04,579
I kind of like that strategy. That you stupid door. It has to be the same color as everything

296
00:51:04,579 --> 00:51:26,869
else. I liked that strategy before it was a fucking terrible strategy. Fucking guy.

297
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:39,900
I thought it was a fat guy. Fucking God again. Where's the fucking sprint guy?

298
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:50,980
I right clicked three times to try to pick that up and it didn't pick it up until like

299
00:51:50,980 --> 00:52:07,179
the fourth one. Why? I seriously, he just fucking like instant teleported around the corner.

300
00:52:07,179 --> 00:52:30,409
I need that gun. The fuck. All right. Can you not like fucking hit box me from five feet away?

301
00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:43,909
Same thing up here. Where's the guy? He's right up here somewhere, right?

302
00:52:46,280 --> 00:53:02,539
Jesus game. Come on. All right. We got one, two, a guy with a gun. I'm going to melee over

303
00:53:02,539 --> 00:53:07,800
here. Is this a toothbrush? Bring this gun a little closer because I know for a fact I'm

304
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:15,829
going to fuck it up and need it. What the hell? What the hell? Where's the gun? Oh, what happened

305
00:53:15,829 --> 00:53:30,860
to the gun? I threw it up here. I'm going to shoot this guy from over here. There's a guy.

306
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:39,989
Is that guy alive to the right? I think he is. Is he? He's not moving. Is this guy alive

307
00:53:39,989 --> 00:54:01,750
right here? He is. It's one of these idiots. Okay, gun. Fucking bird noise. All right. I

308
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:05,670
got to be very careful here. This too, this too much can go wrong. Don't do it yet.

309
00:54:13,059 --> 00:54:33,960
Okay. Got it. Last guy. This guy has a gun. Yet. Escape. No, it's not over.

310
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:40,179
Don't have a guy. I don't have a guy come over to me. It killed me.

311
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:44,869
Oh, okay. We've got this. We're evacuating. Go get yourself out of here.

312
00:54:49,340 --> 00:55:00,139
I'm just kidding. I'm not going to press fucking reset. Oh boy. Hey, I still got it.

313
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:10,739
I might have failed that level though. It depends. Not even a confirmation.

314
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:22,860
What do you think? D? That's all right. C-. I got a better score because I rewound.

315
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:30,949
After that, well, there's not a whole lot more to tell. If I may ask, where did you go after

316
00:55:30,949 --> 00:55:36,860
you escaped? I guess I might as well tell you. I went to Hawaii. You see, that's why I need

317
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:40,780
you to get me a plane ticket. By the way, those of you guys that are watching,

318
00:55:42,059 --> 00:55:46,860
this is like 80% of the way through the game. This is not like Hotline Miami 2 part 1.

319
00:55:47,590 --> 00:55:51,510
We played this a couple of days ago. I'm just finishing it up. I'm going to play it until it's

320
00:55:51,510 --> 00:56:01,340
done. And there you go. Spoiler if you've never seen the game. This is not level 1. You see,

321
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:05,900
that's why I need you to get me a plane ticket. It's not for me. It's for my mother. I'm

322
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:10,630
really worried about her. She can't take care of herself. I was hoping you could get her

323
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:16,139
to come here. I understand I'm going to have to check my bank account. I'll get the money

324
00:56:16,139 --> 00:56:22,469
for it one way or another, okay? Wouldn't be right otherwise. I don't think you understand

325
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:29,780
how much of a help you've been. By the way, those of you that are just joining us now,

326
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:33,219
I want to make sure I make this very clear. We talked about it. Let's talk about it for like

327
00:56:33,219 --> 00:56:39,639
a couple minutes right now. Christmas Eve is going to be a stream. And you, yes,

328
00:56:39,639 --> 00:56:45,940
you are going to be involved if you want. There's a channel on the Discord right now

329
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:50,500
that is designed for you to give suggestions of what you'd like to buy me for Christmas.

330
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:54,260
And it's going to be secret. I'm not going to know what they are. It's going to be

331
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:58,340
secretly purchased. You don't have to buy anything. Yeah, I'm going to buy it

332
00:56:59,539 --> 00:57:03,460
through a proxy. So I will not know what it is. And they're going to be wrapped and I'm

333
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:11,460
going to open them on stream on Christmas Eve. That is what's happening. Your suggestions have

334
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:17,940
to be an Amazon link and they have to be prime shippable. Otherwise I will not be able

335
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:24,820
to get them in time. Has to be Amazon. Has to be prime shippable. Shippable. Shippable.

336
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:36,500
There's too many P's in that word. And your suggestions have to be between zero and fifty

337
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:44,809
dollars. No more than that. Maximum budget that's allowed is fifty bucks. And the mods are going

338
00:57:44,809 --> 00:57:50,150
to take this from the suggestions and I come up with a Christmas list and that's one of

339
00:57:50,150 --> 00:58:00,280
the things we're going to be doing on Christmas Eve. Zero dollars. Dear Evan, I haven't heard

340
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:04,679
from you in a while. I miss you. The kids miss you too. I think we can still make this work

341
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:09,239
but I can't live with a man who puts his job before his family. I still love you. You know

342
00:58:09,239 --> 00:58:17,980
I do. I hope you love me too. Please call me when you read this. Sharon. 49.99 or

343
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:29,179
fifty dollars. Like fifty. Five zero dot space zero zero zero. Why are there multiple

344
00:58:29,179 --> 00:58:46,019
things to look at here? Hold on. Wait what? Act six catastrophe. Did I just go am I

345
00:58:46,019 --> 00:58:52,980
writing a story right now? You wanted to see me boss. Yeah we've got things to do tonight.

346
00:58:54,420 --> 00:59:01,659
Like what? You know the strip club on 77th? It's opening up tomorrow. So? The Colombians

347
00:59:01,659 --> 00:59:07,829
they own the place. They're having an opening party tonight. VIPs only. Let you find out.

348
00:59:07,829 --> 00:59:13,480
How do you think they invited me? Bring your guns. We're going to make sure they have a

349
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:18,280
fun party. You want to start a war with the Colombians. Is that really a good idea?

350
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:23,530
Got a lot more people than we do. After my father died they went in and stole our territory. Our

351
00:59:23,530 --> 00:59:27,369
business. You think I'm just gonna let that slide. This is really a good time for it.

352
00:59:27,369 --> 00:59:31,820
This is not going to be a better time while we wait. They keep expanding. Now who's the

353
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:36,230
boss here? You or me? You got any more objections? You're the boss. They'll do

354
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:48,250
whatever you tell me. Alright then let's go. So now I play as this guy. You guys know that

355
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:53,380
machine that you punch and it tells you like how many pounds per square inch your punches are?

356
00:59:53,380 --> 01:00:00,170
I can get that thing over like seven or eight hundred. I can almost get that thing.

357
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:08,869
I can almost max that thing out at nine nine nine nine nine. Stop changing characters. I have no

358
01:00:08,869 --> 01:00:16,679
control over it. Yeah okay sure. I'll prove it. Next time I'm available and I'm in front of one

359
01:00:16,679 --> 01:00:19,639
of those things I'm going to I'm going to hit that thing over a hundred pounds per square

360
01:00:19,639 --> 01:00:24,789
inch. I impress people all the time. They go holy shit man. Well you go like it's my turn.

361
01:00:24,789 --> 01:00:30,059
They're like like 620 and I'm like oh wow that was pretty good. You know another guy

362
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:35,500
goes up like oh wow the 540. That's a lot dude. That's a fucking shit load. Good for you.

363
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:40,420
Somebody else comes up and like spins around runs across the room sprinting and then they punch as

364
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:46,059
hard as they can. Like seven seven hundred and then the whole place fucking screams and I just

365
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:51,369
like crack my neck a little bit. I'm like um let me try. I'll try. It sounds like fun.

366
01:00:51,369 --> 01:00:53,690
I get up there and I fucking destroy this thing and the thing goes like

367
01:00:54,650 --> 01:01:01,659
and then people just their jaws drop because I do about 800 fucking per pound per square

368
01:01:01,659 --> 01:01:09,500
inch punch. I know I can do it and I'm just letting them all have like their moment

369
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:14,940
with their like 600 pounds per square inch punches and I let them have it and I'm like yeah yeah and

370
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:28,920
then I get up there and I'm telling you this is real. I'll do it. You want to see like how

371
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:35,030
ferocious of a person I am. The next time one of those is around I'm going to have somebody

372
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:44,650
videotape me doing it. 21st scene. This is called the screw. What was it called? I didn't

373
01:01:44,650 --> 01:01:57,380
I saw it for one second. Roll dodge. That's all I have. Oh seizure. Okay I can't pick

374
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:07,019
anything else. I don't want to dodge roll. All right let's go. I didn't why did I not hit that

375
01:02:07,019 --> 01:02:22,949

376
01:02:22,949 --> 01:02:35,670

377
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:54,760
through here. God it's so dark. Come on. Where are you? We go. Here comes two other guys. All

378
01:02:54,760 --> 01:03:03,909

379
01:03:03,909 --> 01:03:16,070
All right. That guy's just dancing over there. I need to light up again so I can see. Turn it

380
01:03:16,070 --> 01:03:24,940
up. All right. All right. You get you get one piece of pez. Let's go with this. I can't tell

381
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:33,500
it was anybody else. There's a guy right here. Well where'd he go? Where did that guy go?

382
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:42,300
God damn it. All right. Well I'm just gonna go in here and shoot these guys I guess. All

383
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:54,219
right. I don't know. I can't. That guy's a window. That's it up here. I'm just gonna

384
01:03:54,219 --> 01:04:01,929
keep going. What the fuck? That patrol took so long for him to get down here.

385
01:04:01,929 --> 01:04:26,619
Where the hell was that guy? All right. Again we've got these two guys. Got a knife. Pull

386
01:04:26,619 --> 01:04:42,039
them over here. Why are you like this? What? Am I missing something here? Am I

387
01:04:42,039 --> 01:04:53,260
missing something here? Is he like up? Who the hell is this guy? Why can I not? Okay.

388
01:04:53,260 --> 01:05:38,440
That was weird. That patrol didn't get him. Shit. Last guy. There he is. What? What? Where?

389
01:05:38,440 --> 01:06:18,599
What? What killed me? There's a guy in a bush. Why am I fucking not surprised? All right. I

390
01:06:18,599 --> 01:06:29,820
gotta shoot this guy. I just took the guy's head off. All right. Again I can't see anything

391
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:37,030
on the ground. I guess there's a gun here. All right. Watch out for guy in the bush.

392
01:06:37,590 --> 01:06:50,090
That's great. I love everything about that. Fucking asshole. All right. Let's go. I have

393
01:06:50,090 --> 01:07:16,789
a choice apparently. I can't go that way. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. He came out this time. Well. Well.

394
01:07:16,789 --> 01:07:34,539
Okay. I'm gonna miss somebody and I'm not gonna even see them. I guarantee that. Someone's

395
01:07:34,539 --> 01:07:54,840
gonna be like hiding in a sofa and they're gonna shoot me. The dog. Don't let me forget

396
01:07:54,840 --> 01:08:10,219
about the dog. I will forget about that fucking dog. Is he still alive? What? Huh? Huh? Huh?

397
01:08:10,219 --> 01:08:21,579
Why am I? Stop doing that. Huh? Why am I making that fucking noise? Relax. Dog. Dog.

398
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:31,899
Who's left? I don't know. Maybe the one with 20. All right. We got guy with a shotgun. I'm

399
01:08:31,899 --> 01:08:40,810
gonna keep this guy locked on because I know I'm gonna fuck this up. Told you. I just

400
01:08:40,810 --> 01:08:48,119
didn't even look. I hope I got somebody. What is the fucking door in the way?

401
01:08:57,029 --> 01:09:16,949
Who is left? I'm so paranoid. Right here. Last guy? Yep. Okay. I guess I'm gonna go over here.

402
01:09:24,810 --> 01:09:38,550
Well. That was it. Apparently. Go to the car. But what about over here? I want to go up

403
01:09:38,550 --> 01:09:44,170
that way. Is it the same? No. It's the same thing. No. Just different entrance. Okay. Well.

404
01:09:47,479 --> 01:09:59,289
That wasn't hard enough for you. No. That was okay. That was fine. That was like a nice level.

405
01:09:59,850 --> 01:10:27,130
It was challenging. Dark. Nice. Always a C. All right. Somebody tell me. I'm unlocking

406
01:10:31,350 --> 01:10:36,250
items that I'm... I thought that was a fucking like... I thought that was a monster and those

407
01:10:36,250 --> 01:10:39,210
were eyes for a second. I was like who's in like a different costume? I thought it was like

408
01:10:39,210 --> 01:10:42,970
a weird like bear costume. Whatever. Let's just not pay attention to it.

409
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:51,500
Ugh. We sure did a number on those bastards, huh? Call us for a celebration, don't you think?

410
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:56,600
I don't know, boss. That's what that is. It's not... there's no nudity here.

411
01:10:57,159 --> 01:11:03,500
That's those people in costumes. Those are just like eyes and that's like a head and they have

412
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:08,859
like hats on. You know how I make like 40% of every rumble character in the new 2k games?

413
01:11:09,939 --> 01:11:14,420
That's... that's what it is. I don't know, boss. You don't know what the hell is that

414
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:22,409
supposed to mean. I think I'm gonna head back home. I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

415
01:11:22,409 --> 01:11:30,729
And why is that? You've got all you need right here, don't you? I gotta get home to my girlfriend.

416
01:11:30,729 --> 01:11:37,829
Been a long day, you know? You guys see that fucking shark? Yeah, it's a pretty big shark.

417
01:11:37,829 --> 01:11:42,390
Boy, that girl sure did a number on you, huh? You know, a real man doesn't need to rely

418
01:11:42,390 --> 01:11:46,789
on women to live his life. The minute you get attached to anyone, you know you're fucked.

419
01:11:46,789 --> 01:11:51,270
Besides, that girl of yours is way too good for you. One day she will come to her senses,

420
01:11:51,270 --> 01:11:56,890
you know. Well, that's none of my business. Go on home if that's what you want.

421
01:12:01,979 --> 01:12:07,560
All right, see you soon. Oh, before you go, I left a little something for you on the desk outside.

422
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:22,149
Buy your girl something nice. I can't, like, smash this? What is it? Oh, nice. Money! Thanks

423
01:12:22,149 --> 01:12:42,010
for the money. Oh, I can't go in the cool car? I let the door open? It's all right. All right,

424
01:12:42,010 --> 01:12:46,359
boys, this is it. Tonight we'll be rich. We can do anything we want. The Colombians will

425
01:12:46,359 --> 01:12:51,319
have nothing left. They'll learn to fear us. Toast to our new lives as kings of the street.

426
01:12:51,880 --> 01:13:20,460
This kind of sounds like a cool Bowser theme song from Mario and Luigi RPG games. Don't die

427
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:34,260
on the third floor. All right, I'll try not to. Am I supposed to be getting attacked here?

428
01:13:34,819 --> 01:13:47,930
If only we could hear it. You can hear it. Uh, guys? Oh, what an end. What an end to the

429
01:13:47,930 --> 01:14:02,600
arc. Oh, there's guys right there. Let's see if we can spring something together here.

430
01:14:03,159 --> 01:14:23,220
Turn the mouse sensitivity down. It's fucking me up. Need a new weapon.

431
01:14:25,850 --> 01:14:39,670
Ooh, boy. Come on up. Pistol, please. All right, this somebody, this people down here.

432
01:14:40,390 --> 01:14:47,500
I'm gonna get lit up by this guy. No, okay. They don't have line of sight here?

433
01:14:49,369 --> 01:14:52,729
No, just I'm checking to make sure they don't have, you know, pull them. What's the point

434
01:14:52,729 --> 01:15:00,539
of that? How do they miss? Just this guy. What about down here? Nobody. Okay, got ya.

435
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:41,380
Pistol. I would like that. Fuck. I don't know. Knew it. Okay, we're good. Straight up.

436
01:15:43,479 --> 01:15:53,770
Okay, we've got, ooh, I didn't mean to do that. Well, okay. I feel like I have to stand here.

437
01:15:57,500 --> 01:16:05,340
Sensitivity, please. All right, let me think about this. So, this guy's gonna get up.

438
01:16:06,140 --> 01:16:12,409
And then, nobody. There's a, watch out for the walls. I got a guy here.

439
01:16:13,369 --> 01:16:18,729
Why ya, why we? Oh, okay. Whatever. Who has sight on me? Somebody all the way up there?

440
01:16:21,579 --> 01:16:31,529
Okay, I get it. Okay, get you. Get you. Watch everybody come around the corner.

441
01:16:32,649 --> 01:16:47,350
That leaves you. You. And somebody else, I guess. You two. I need to make sure that none of you

442
01:16:47,350 --> 01:17:02,119
people up here are going to kill me like you. One, two, three. That it? Nope. Couple of guys

443
01:17:02,119 --> 01:17:09,140
left. Although, I want this gun. It's more reliable for me. What do we got? See if I

444
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:14,340
can get them both. Nope. I should still be able to get you though. Oh, no, I didn't. I got

445
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:24,699
him. I got him. Is it safe? That's the question. I don't think, I think it's just this guy.

446
01:17:24,699 --> 01:17:30,470
Nobody else in this room. No hidden people. No bush. Almost guy in a bush. He was, he was

447
01:17:30,470 --> 01:17:40,199
turning into a bush guy. I got him before he transformed. Do it before he gets up!

448
01:17:40,760 --> 01:18:00,250
All right, we're good. Is that it? Oh, no. There. That should disable all the security

449
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:06,970
doors. I heard about this guy, the Joker. Yeah, he's crazy. You hear how weird he is?

450
01:18:06,970 --> 01:18:28,060
Yes, I have heard about how weird he is. Whoops. I can't. What the fuck? The Joker

451
01:18:28,060 --> 01:18:31,180
misses at the beginning of the movie. Don't worry. You've never seen, I've never seen

452
01:18:31,180 --> 01:18:41,430
Star Wars before. This, yo, it's fine. You'll be fine. How are you still living? How are

453
01:18:41,430 --> 01:19:22,949
you still among the living? You got shot. Oi! I don't know. I have a gun in my hand.

454
01:19:22,949 --> 01:19:28,630
Oh, you put the gun down when you do that. All right, let's see who's up here.

455
01:19:29,590 --> 01:19:44,010
You. Dead. Dead. Dead. Anybody else? Ah, place to hide. Good vantage point. Guy with the gun.

456
01:19:44,729 --> 01:19:53,020
We got fat guy. I need another gun. I need that. Give it to me.

457
01:19:55,079 --> 01:20:10,340
Ah, you. Be right back. Oh shit. Okay, I'm fine. Why was I even locked on? Made no sense.

458
01:20:14,710 --> 01:20:16,949
Ha, now I'm not locked on and it was a problem.

459
01:20:18,310 --> 01:20:23,800
All right, that's it. Just the two guys in there. Shouldn't be too much of a problem.

460
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:34,739
It will be though. Of course it will be. And hey ho ho. Got it. Okay. All right,

461
01:20:34,739 --> 01:20:50,649
just slurp it up. Did you say I'm high as fuck? Father, what are you doing here?

462
01:20:53,619 --> 01:21:10,359
I'm not here. You know that. Yes, I know. Then why are you here? I don't know. I want

463
01:21:10,359 --> 01:21:16,279
to make you proud. Such things don't matter. I can see you haven't changed. You're just like

464
01:21:16,279 --> 01:21:24,439
me. You won't get in it until it's already too late. You know, it's me the chicken. Your

465
01:21:24,439 --> 01:21:29,399
father is right. You don't get it, do you? Not that it matters anymore. It's all the same in

466
01:21:29,399 --> 01:21:35,539
the end. And there's nothing wrong. There's nothing you can do about that, is there?

467
01:21:37,420 --> 01:21:57,939
Goddamn. But father. We already told you, Dutch. He's not here anymore. In fact, neither are you.

468
01:21:57,939 --> 01:22:11,819
That was a B for effort. A C- for effort. My face came on. Let me turn it off. Thanks

469
01:22:11,819 --> 01:22:27,270
for reminding me. Uh, you are style unlocked. Blood? What was it? What? Why is it already

470
01:22:27,270 --> 01:22:45,539
laughing? It's already laughing at me. Blood tired. I am still a little blood tired. I don't

471
01:22:45,539 --> 01:22:48,899
know about you guys, but when I get blood taken, it takes me like three or four days

472
01:22:48,899 --> 01:22:55,880
to completely recover from it. I just feel my life force draining and it just, it throws me off

473
01:22:55,880 --> 01:23:04,949
for almost a week. It took six, seven vials. What do we have here? And I had to breathe into

474
01:23:04,949 --> 01:23:13,770
a bag. They were testing to see if I have, um, Healabacta pylori, which is like a bad

475
01:23:13,770 --> 01:23:19,909
stomach and intestinal bacteria. That's a whole ordeal, but everything's fine. Don't worry.

476
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:29,130
Uh, what do we have here, Johnson? That's not real. They were just fucking with you. What?

477
01:23:30,810 --> 01:23:36,180
H. pylori is like a bacteria. I looked it up. What do we have here? Looks like your

478
01:23:36,180 --> 01:23:49,289
perp's been at it again. This one got quite the treatment. How much for a vial of my blood?

479
01:23:49,289 --> 01:23:53,289
You're not getting any of my blood. This is one got quite the treatment. He left another

480
01:23:53,289 --> 01:23:57,130
message. You have to stop them. I don't want to take any more innocent lives. Whoever did

481
01:23:57,130 --> 01:24:03,880
this must be completely out of their mind. He's a whack job, all right? This city seems

482
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:08,649
to be full of them. Did he leave any clues behind? The chief's going to be on my ass

483
01:24:08,649 --> 01:24:15,989
with all the press with this will get a shell casing and a couple of prints.

484
01:24:15,989 --> 01:24:22,630
No, you know, you know why I would never give somebody my blood because that's everything.

485
01:24:24,039 --> 01:24:27,800
Like you're talking about everything. Oh, you're concerned that your passwords are in

486
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:34,180
there. Your DNA is in there. Your entire genetic makeup is in that vial. Everything

487
01:24:34,180 --> 01:24:39,750
about you that ever will be and ever was. I don't want you guys to know what my fucking

488
01:24:39,989 --> 01:24:48,920
body passwords are. Are you serious? A shell casing and a couple of prints is going to be

489
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:55,670
hard to see if they match the victim given the state he's in. Might find more when we do

490
01:24:55,670 --> 01:25:00,300
a more thorough inspection of the place. Well, I hope you do find something. Not to put any

491
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:05,270
pressure on you guys, but my job's on the line on this one. We'll do our best. All right,

492
01:25:05,270 --> 01:25:09,819
don't think I'll be much use here. I'm pretty beat. I'm heading home to catch some sleep.

493
01:25:09,819 --> 01:25:16,970
Let me know what you find tomorrow. We'll do sir. I don't know. I don't know what my blood

494
01:25:16,970 --> 01:25:44,630
type is. I have no idea. Four? I don't know. I don't know. Brute force his blood. No,

495
01:25:44,630 --> 01:25:51,609
sooner or later. I don't want anyone to have that because sooner or later in 500 years,

496
01:25:51,609 --> 01:25:56,250
you'll be able to like read people's thoughts with their DNA and shit. You'll be able to like

497
01:25:56,250 --> 01:26:01,050
recreate somebody's brain and look up like, like in their brain catalog, everything they've

498
01:26:01,050 --> 01:26:08,060
ever done or said or anything they ever spoke of. You're going to be able to pour my blood

499
01:26:08,060 --> 01:26:11,500
into like a machine and go through my back catalog and find out last time I shit my

500
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:30,310
pants. I don't want you to be able to do that ever in a thousand years. Time for bed. Why would

501
01:26:30,310 --> 01:26:38,939
you care if it's a thousand years? Because I can't, I don't know. I don't want, I can't find it.

502
01:26:44,380 --> 01:26:56,300
Thunder and lightning. I can't find it. What am I looking for? You'll be able to take that

503
01:26:56,300 --> 01:27:02,390
blood DNA brain thing and you'll be able to just go watch a video recording of me,

504
01:27:02,390 --> 01:27:15,029
like a POV of me eating a booger when I was 11. That's scary. No, we got a huge amount

505
01:27:15,029 --> 01:27:18,310
of community subs here. Furt, thank you Furt. Fernandez for the 10 community subs.

506
01:27:24,199 --> 01:27:36,090
Thank you so much for 10 community subs coming in right now. Am I missing something here?

507
01:27:45,220 --> 01:27:56,069
Looking for this. For Smash. You know, Convert. You know, Convert for Smash.

508
01:27:57,029 --> 01:28:02,119
What are you doing here? This is a crime scene. Well, you know what they say.

509
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:10,600
Twitterers always return to the scene of the crime. I guess there must be some truth to that,

510
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:18,329
huh? Right, who are you? You don't recognize me? We're related by blood, aren't we?

511
01:28:19,899 --> 01:28:26,359
Think of me as your son. You created me after all. Give me back my gun, creep. You want it,

512
01:28:26,359 --> 01:28:49,189
huh? How about a hug instead? What? Did I drop a TV on his head? There you are, hop on in.

513
01:28:49,270 --> 01:29:02,300
Your next scene is up. So step on it. Is there a reason why we took the dog van from Dumb and

514
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:19,609
Dumber? Okay, um, your next scene is up. What just happened? What did I just do? What?

515
01:29:20,250 --> 01:29:29,050
So this hotline Miami is just a movie? Is that what this is?

516
01:29:29,770 --> 01:29:50,550
Oh, I need that gun. Speaking of guns. I got stuck. I got stuck. I got stuck. Speaking of

517
01:29:50,550 --> 01:30:04,569
guns. Give me that one. Holy fuck. Got the gun over here. Anybody else in this room? Oh yeah,

518
01:30:04,569 --> 01:30:22,600
there is. What is this guy? What is that guy? I don't know yet. He left it. I'll deal with

519
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:30,039
him in a minute. I don't know. I had the glass. He was, ah, I had that so clean too.

520
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:46,710
That really was clean. Glass windows. Every fucking, every fucking level has to have a

521
01:30:46,710 --> 01:31:07,130
glass window. Everywhere. No, always a mistake. Never hit space on anybody for any reason.

522
01:31:07,130 --> 01:31:10,329
What's the reason for it? It just takes extra time. You just get extra points.

523
01:31:10,890 --> 01:31:15,369
I'm just a C minus fucking streamer. Why do I care about like the extra 200 points?

524
01:31:16,170 --> 01:31:22,939
2000 points. Rewind. What are you talking about? Why would I rewind? Why would I do that?

525
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:32,500
No, I'm not going to rewind. I missed a cut scene. If I rewind, where is it going to

526
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:38,100
put me? I broke the game. Why did I break the game? What? I better not regret this.

527
01:31:48,819 --> 01:32:00,460
I went all the way. How did I get it to work? I have no idea. What was I? Was I delirious?

528
01:32:00,460 --> 01:32:07,739
What were we talking about? DNA? Detective Pardo, you're a disgrace. I've never heard

529
01:32:07,739 --> 01:32:11,260
of anything like this before. Normally, I never offer any kindness to a person such

530
01:32:11,260 --> 01:32:15,420
as yourself, but since you are a police officer, I will now give you a choice.

531
01:32:15,420 --> 01:32:19,260
Turn yourself in and confess to your crimes. Maybe they'll go easy on you.

532
01:32:19,260 --> 01:32:23,180
If you don't, I have several officers waiting outside to arrest you.

533
01:32:23,979 --> 01:32:28,119
Sir, I'm not sure what you're talking about here. What is it you think I've done?

534
01:32:29,340 --> 01:32:33,100
Think I have a pile of evidence here against you. Ballistics report, fingerprints,

535
01:32:33,100 --> 01:32:40,470
witness statements. To think a police officer would be the Miami mutilator. You make me sick.

536
01:32:41,109 --> 01:32:44,630
Now hand me your badge. I'll have one of our officers take your confession.

537
01:32:45,430 --> 01:32:48,390
Sir, there must have been some mistake. Someone must have set me up.

538
01:32:49,510 --> 01:32:53,590
I'll prove it to you if you just let me go, okay? You're going nowhere, Pardo.

539
01:32:54,149 --> 01:32:59,189
Don't make this any harder than it already is. Sorry, sir. You'll have to take me by force.

540
01:32:59,189 --> 01:33:08,630
Well, I did really miss a lot, didn't I? I just walked on the movie set and then started

541
01:33:08,630 --> 01:33:33,100
punching people. That doesn't work on dogs. All right, all right. That's it. Keep it going.

542
01:33:33,819 --> 01:33:49,029
Pistol. Oh, oh, oh, why? I'm actually upset by that. I'm actually pissed off. What am I doing?

543
01:34:02,420 --> 01:34:10,090
I want this gun. That one. That one. I want this one. Okay, so we've got

544
01:34:11,460 --> 01:34:30,170
gun. No gun. Gun, gun, gun. Watch out for that gun. I didn't even get the guy. Oh,

545
01:34:30,250 --> 01:34:52,039
fucking that's called panicking. All right. Hydrate. I'm very hydrated. Yeah, I've got a

546
01:34:53,369 --> 01:35:02,890
water here. I'm good. What about the guy in here? No, that guy would have just killed me

547
01:35:02,890 --> 01:35:18,420
if he had a gun. I was prepared for it. You know, I was very prepared. Oh,

548
01:35:23,449 --> 01:35:33,689
grab the shotgun. Oh, yeah. Here it comes. This is where I get. I had it and it was so

549
01:35:33,689 --> 01:35:44,310
clean and I did it. I did that. I had that. So I got all nice shot, shot, shot, shot.

550
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:58,520
We call this bullshit. This is called bullshit. By the way, nobody in the world,

551
01:35:58,520 --> 01:36:04,520
nobody on earth. Let's go over like offices. Okay. This makes sense. Nobody has a window

552
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:10,149
to another like coworkers office like this. This window doesn't do anything. Nobody has

553
01:36:10,149 --> 01:36:21,720
a window like this. This is called whining. Nobody has a window here. And who built these?

554
01:36:22,520 --> 01:36:30,310
The window should be here to the outside. I've seen something like that before, actually.

555
01:36:31,539 --> 01:36:46,729
Wait, I won. I won. I'm not whining. Am I? Is this whining? This guy with the taser.

556
01:36:46,729 --> 01:37:12,010
I'm about to start fucking whining. Okay. Got him. Die. I had it. What am I doing?

557
01:37:12,739 --> 01:37:22,619
Just shoot him. I mean, why do I have to be paranoid of 15 people with guns? Fine,

558
01:37:22,619 --> 01:37:41,609
I'll do the strategy and it would have worked. Just shoot him. What the fuck was that? Dude.

559
01:37:53,270 --> 01:37:55,750
You know, I wanted to pick up the same weapon twice. That'd be wonderful.

560
01:38:00,310 --> 01:38:13,050
Got it. Okay. Geez. Any more windows? Gun. What the fuck? Whoa.

561
01:38:13,050 --> 01:38:21,239
Oh, fucking office windows. Why do they have? God damn it. What the fuck?

562
01:38:22,439 --> 01:38:38,890
What the hell? It's so unnecessary. He's terrible at 80% of every game he plays.

563
01:38:39,609 --> 01:38:48,279
Give me a break. Please. What? This shit is fucking hard as shit.

564
01:38:52,180 --> 01:38:58,020
People have quit this game. Like not played for six months. You saw the chat room. People

565
01:38:58,020 --> 01:39:14,380
went away from this game for six months. I'm still here. One guy said that. Yeah,

566
01:39:14,380 --> 01:39:24,520
and that's fine because the game is fucking hard. I read a post on Twitter where a guy said he

567
01:39:24,520 --> 01:39:44,500
couldn't even beat the first room. All right. Come on. I got a C on these levels. Did I

568
01:39:44,500 --> 01:40:05,880
get that guy too? That worked. That worked. Now, I went to Twitter. There was a guy that

569
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:10,550
was like, hey, I can't beat the first room. Can somebody help? What do you think the

570
01:40:10,550 --> 01:40:40,359
responses were? Idiot. Fucking this stupid door. Hey, you want to know what all the responses were?

571
01:40:41,609 --> 01:40:52,810
Idiot. And then he finally beat the second floor. And he went out back on Twitter and he said,

572
01:40:52,810 --> 01:40:56,329
hey guys, I beat the second floor. I'm really trying. It's a tough game.

573
01:40:57,369 --> 01:41:11,300
Idiot. And this is how you make me making this story up. So? You don't think this

574
01:41:11,300 --> 01:41:28,039
happened at one point? Somebody said this. Give me one pellet on this guy. Come on. Nobody

575
01:41:28,039 --> 01:41:38,380
else is up here, right? Get good. Most people get good. Oh, I've got some news for you. I've got

576
01:41:38,380 --> 01:41:44,600
news for you. Go open up the achievements of this game on Steam. How many people have gotten past

577
01:41:44,600 --> 01:41:59,050
the first level? It's not even going to be fucking 30%. I can't answer that. How many

578
01:41:59,050 --> 01:42:04,810
people beat the cleric beast? It's like 40. You're one of 40 people that did that. You

579
01:42:04,810 --> 01:42:23,270
should be proud of yourself. Put your hands behind your head. Get down on the ground.

580
01:42:28,470 --> 01:42:48,069
29% of people have the beat the game achievement. So, yeah. What the heck? That's less than a third

581
01:42:48,069 --> 01:42:59,579
of all people that have played this game on Steam. Stop flaming me. Stop flaming me.

582
01:43:04,760 --> 01:43:10,039
Two out of thirds of bad? No, it's not. Come on. You can't look at it like that.

583
01:43:11,770 --> 01:43:19,640
If 70% of everybody doesn't beat the game, does that mean that 70% of people aren't good

584
01:43:19,640 --> 01:43:25,640
gamers? I mean, probably. You're probably right. Don't shoot. I'm a detective. Here's my badge.

585
01:43:28,390 --> 01:43:33,369
I said get down on the ground. This is your last warning. Let me through. I'm a police.

586
01:43:34,569 --> 01:43:48,069
I don't get losing for that, right? You'd be surprised if you go look at achievements

587
01:43:48,069 --> 01:44:07,369
and trophies. This is Pardo speaking. Cough. They're casuals. Are they though? What if they

588
01:44:07,369 --> 01:44:13,670
just aren't good at it? It's okay. That's okay if you're not good at it.

589
01:44:13,750 --> 01:44:25,750
We need you down at the station. I don't feel too good. I'm gonna have to take the day off.

590
01:44:25,750 --> 01:44:58,329
This isn't really the time. You're not a pro gamer. T? C-? I've never failed a level.

591
01:44:58,970 --> 01:45:20,920
Hey, you there. I'm here to see your boss. Bring him out for me, will you? You don't have

592
01:45:20,920 --> 01:45:26,779
an appointment, do you? Besides, the boss isn't in. Oh, yeah? Well, his car is right

593
01:45:26,779 --> 01:45:35,770
outside. Boss has many cars. Was there anything else? Playing that game, huh? My back suit

594
01:45:35,770 --> 01:45:41,960
won't be telling that, okay? Time, guys. After today, we'll be in the big league again.

595
01:45:41,960 --> 01:45:47,720
Just remember the plan and don't be late. If you are, we're toast. All right, I'm going

596
01:45:47,720 --> 01:46:12,020
in. Wish me luck. What? I don't get it. Takeover is the last 24th scene. Killing

597
01:46:12,020 --> 01:46:24,020
punches, no weapons, bloodline, firepower. What is firepower? I guess we'll find out.

598
01:46:24,500 --> 01:46:46,329
Uh, okay. Oh, this must be T-pose, I remember. Oh, that didn't work. Maybe it will.

599
01:46:49,300 --> 01:47:16,380
Fuck, come on. Oh, who's left? Watch it. But where are you gonna come from? Over here,

600
01:47:16,380 --> 01:47:22,899
I see you. Almost out of bullets. I gotta get this last guy right here through the glass.

601
01:47:24,500 --> 01:47:30,460
Okay, who's left? That's a big gun right here, isn't it? No, it's not. Those are the

602
01:47:30,460 --> 01:47:41,420
guns I just had. I was just wearing those. All right, that's fine. Let's go. This is all

603
01:47:41,420 --> 01:47:47,079
cleared down here. Window, though. Watch out for the window. Watch out for the window.

604
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:56,119
I panicked, but it's okay. I need that gun. Uh, this guy right here, I should get side on

605
01:47:56,119 --> 01:48:00,279
him right there. Nope. I'll try it again. I got it. Okay. What about you right here?

606
01:48:01,239 --> 01:48:23,819
Got it. What? What's going on? Uh, is there a reason for that? One guy over there with

607
01:48:23,819 --> 01:48:27,260
a gun. Everybody else has melee. I don't think, unless I miss somebody over here.

608
01:48:28,979 --> 01:48:39,369
Yep, I did. What do I have to do with you? What do I do with you? What the fuck? No. What? I

609
01:48:41,289 --> 01:48:49,770
tried to punch him. He has so much reach. Holy shit. I mean, I knew it was the duck guy,

610
01:48:49,770 --> 01:49:01,750
but he has like some insane reach. You can't punch him. Okay. So I need a melee weapon?

611
01:49:02,470 --> 01:49:10,100
Because I could punch the other. I could punch the other guy that was running. That was melee

612
01:49:10,100 --> 01:49:31,130
only. Apparently not this dude. How's that guy doing? Oh fuck! I ran out of bullets right at

613
01:49:31,130 --> 01:49:57,029
the end. 64 bullets remaining in that. I say that like that's not very much. Same deal. All

614
01:49:57,029 --> 01:50:09,449
right, where's the melee weapon? Right here, down around you. Let's wait. All right, then you

615
01:50:09,449 --> 01:50:23,189
and you. Little dog. Yep. Give me a melee weapon. No, I could probably get you too.

616
01:50:24,729 --> 01:50:36,420
No, I can't. Whatever. I think I need a gun. I believe I, yeah, I need to kill these dudes

617
01:50:36,420 --> 01:50:57,029
here. One more guy up there, I think. Maybe not. Can I pull him out? Can I like throw

618
01:50:58,199 --> 01:51:05,510
a knife over there? Over that? Or let hit it? I'm not sure. Once I shoot this guy,

619
01:51:05,510 --> 01:51:25,300
though, he's gonna run out. Is he out? No, he's not out. Okay, now melee weapon. Let's go.

620
01:51:26,100 --> 01:51:39,539
Pull him out. Let's go. Got it. Okay. Over there. I didn't check over this way though. I

621
01:51:39,539 --> 01:51:47,670
got everybody over here, didn't I? That's where I started, isn't it? Okay, let's wrap around

622
01:51:47,670 --> 01:51:56,420
here again. No other dogs. No random stray people. Okay, I just want to check. I think

623
01:51:56,420 --> 01:52:02,170
there might be another guy over here. I didn't mean to click my fucking thumb.

624
01:52:07,369 --> 01:52:28,409
Ah, holy shit. Okay. So we got one guy left, I think, right here. That's it.

625
01:52:29,210 --> 01:53:04,060
Nobody's standing. Nobody in a bush, right? I'm not gonna get pushed. He's above me. Wow.

626
01:53:04,060 --> 01:53:40,569
What? Oh, he came from the top. Oops. I knew he was coming. Shit. He's coming. Oh, he's

627
01:53:40,569 --> 01:53:44,729
coming. He's coming. He's coming to get me. He's coming to get me. The guy with the melee

628
01:53:44,729 --> 01:54:06,970
is on his way. Oh, fuck. Okay, relax. What else is there? I need a gun. That'll do it.

629
01:54:07,770 --> 01:54:13,239
Windows. Anybody above? I think this room is safe. Yeah, this room is safe except

630
01:54:13,239 --> 01:54:49,899
the windows. Wait, what? Did I knock it through? I just used them on 10. I knew

631
01:54:49,899 --> 01:54:54,460
somebody else was gonna come over there. I knew it. And I fucking freaked out.

632
01:54:57,829 --> 01:55:06,439
Good. All right. Now. Oh, what? There's a window there. They can shoot through here.

633
01:55:07,859 --> 01:55:18,539
Ay, yi, yi. You go through one, two, three, four rooms with this window. There's no other way

634
01:55:18,539 --> 01:55:26,310
you can get over there. Any windows up top? There are windows right there. All right. I gotta

635
01:55:26,310 --> 01:55:59,180
go up. Hold on. All right. Fuck. What? This like across the map. You can't see anybody.

636
01:56:04,090 --> 01:56:24,760
Fucking hell. I'm just gonna sit here. Out of bullets. Somebody's coming. Which way are

637
01:56:24,760 --> 01:56:47,300
they coming though? Are they coming this way? Who else? Anybody else down the whole hallway?

638
01:56:47,300 --> 01:56:54,439
I gotta go this way anyways, bud. Yeah, he saw me. He's coming. That's the guy with the

639
01:56:54,439 --> 01:57:19,180
fucking this thing. Shotgun. I'm gonna get collapsed on. I know it. I'm so paranoid.

640
01:57:19,180 --> 01:57:28,979
Someone's gonna fucking come all the way down here. All right. Safe. What's this? I can't

641
01:57:28,979 --> 01:57:48,500
pick it up. Dog. I have to snipe them over here. I gotta try because this is gonna be

642
01:57:49,460 --> 01:57:59,539
something else here. I gotta pick off at least a couple of people. Dog. There's gonna be a

643
01:57:59,539 --> 01:58:22,649
dog coming. Just wait. You sure? He's coming though. Where's he going? I don't know where

644
01:58:22,649 --> 01:58:48,310
he's going but I'm gonna wait. Excuse me? Did I fall off the map? Did I walk backwards too far?

645
01:58:48,869 --> 01:59:00,920
Is that what happened? Fuck it. No, you can't do it like that unless you memorize the entire

646
01:59:00,920 --> 01:59:03,720
level. You have to, I have to memorize the whole level to play it like that.

647
01:59:04,439 --> 01:59:08,970
All right. Here's the dog. Wait till he goes across the entire map. The whole thing.

648
01:59:09,770 --> 01:59:35,449
I can't believe it. There's probably another dog coming. All right. I got a bunch. Who the fuck

649
01:59:35,449 --> 01:59:41,050
are you? What are you doing on the stairs? Why are you in the very beginning on the stairs

650
01:59:41,050 --> 01:59:45,770
out of my line of sight holding shift the whole way up? What the fuck?

651
01:59:48,010 --> 02:00:39,939
All right. Here he comes. Got it. I gotta piss so bad. No other dogs. Dog. Somebody.

652
02:00:39,939 --> 02:00:46,630
Is somebody here? Somebody's here. Okay. I gotta sit here for a second because I just

653
02:00:46,630 --> 02:01:07,260
may have alerted like at least two. Oh my lord. Okay. Did I get him? Nope. Just wait.

654
02:01:07,819 --> 02:01:22,920
We'll make it over here eventually. He'll find it. Thanks for the new gun. Now it's

655
02:01:22,920 --> 02:01:30,779
a question of shooting through here. Where the fuck? Holy shit. There's an entrance there.

656
02:01:31,579 --> 02:01:36,819
Move out of the way. All right. Anybody. Somebody. I gotta hide it over here.

657
02:01:36,819 --> 02:01:41,300
Just hide here. No. Where? I got a safe room. This one's safe. Right? No, it's not. Yes,

658
02:01:41,300 --> 02:01:53,079
it is. There's only two other people in that other room. I think I'm good. I'm gonna go

659
02:01:53,079 --> 02:02:09,979
down. If I see a dog, I swear to you. I'm so ready for a dog. Where is the dog?

660
02:02:13,670 --> 02:02:21,659
Look at how far away you are. I'm so fucking paranoid right now. Any other guns up here?

661
02:02:21,659 --> 02:02:31,819
This one. Did I get him? I'm gonna go for it. Whatever. Guy on the stairs. Right? Nope.

662
02:02:32,539 --> 02:02:41,420
Is it? Okay. Wait, wait, wait. I need to. Okay. There's a machete right here.

663
02:02:43,220 --> 02:02:50,890
Give me the machete. Oh, you idiot. You fucking idiot. Is it safe to get that?

664
02:02:55,640 --> 02:03:13,079
One guy right here. Holy fuck. He almost just got me. Last guy. Right? Nope. That guy

665
02:03:13,079 --> 02:03:24,010
would have killed me. Alright. So looks like I gotta go down. Last dude right here. No windows

666
02:03:24,010 --> 02:03:36,470
for him to shoot me. Nobody else. Just him. I know I freaked out right there, but you gotta

667
02:03:36,470 --> 02:04:24,199
do what you gotta do. Alright. Another one. This way. Fuck. Damn it. Alright. Wrap around.

668
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:32,810
Let's do it again here. Give me the shotgun. So I gotta take this guy out

669
02:04:33,529 --> 02:04:49,579
cleanly. He's all the way at the end and then shotgun blast once. I, whatever. Three shots.

670
02:04:49,579 --> 02:05:02,250
Who's up there? Okay. It's safe. No, it's not. I can't go over there. Dog. Dog. Big guy.

671
02:05:03,130 --> 02:05:39,720
This room is safe. I need a better gun than this. Windows. No, I gotta be. Dog. Nope.

672
02:05:39,720 --> 02:06:03,239
Can go. Just gonna make sure no one's right. Okay. There's another dog. Watch it. Watch it.

673
02:06:04,199 --> 02:06:15,779
That's not gonna make anybody sprint over here. We sure about that? Give me the other gun. These

674
02:06:15,779 --> 02:06:19,779
dogs are freaking out. Are they trying to come get me? I think they trying to get me,

675
02:06:19,779 --> 02:06:24,840
but I don't know. I gotta go. I gotta take those. Okay. There's a melee only guy right here.

676
02:06:24,840 --> 02:06:31,819
I gotta get this guy now. Okay. So give me a melee weapon. I'm gonna go pull that guy out.

677
02:06:32,460 --> 02:06:45,109
Come on. Come on down here. Alright. I think that's it for that. I need a gun back.

678
02:06:45,909 --> 02:06:56,260
They're coming for me. Are they? I have to kill them right now. I gotta go

679
02:06:56,260 --> 02:07:00,420
up down here and I gotta shoot. Alright. That's my plan. Watch out for that guy.

680
02:07:01,300 --> 02:07:21,850
Those dogs are coming after me. I don't know. I hate not being able to see over there.

681
02:07:23,449 --> 02:07:29,319
Dogs are coming over here now. No, they're not. It's not safe standing there.

682
02:07:29,880 --> 02:07:41,770
One dude and then it's safe and I can collect guns. That guy. Is that a melee only guy?

683
02:07:41,770 --> 02:07:56,569
No, just a just a guy. I'm just like losing it. I'm freaking out right now because I'm

684
02:07:56,569 --> 02:08:04,170
terrified of something behind me. Okay, done. New gun. I can go down.

685
02:08:05,050 --> 02:08:12,069
There's only one two remaining. I have to go from this room. No windows.

686
02:08:12,069 --> 02:08:25,180
I just have to shoot. There's a door. Don't fuck it up. I fucked it up. I

687
02:08:25,180 --> 02:08:34,069
fucked it up bad. I fucked it up real bad. Okay. Wait, that's not it?

688
02:08:36,149 --> 02:08:53,060
Where? Okay, that is it. Is it? I see the arrow. Okay, it is. This game is gonna give me diarrhea.

689
02:08:53,060 --> 02:09:00,420
It really is. Fuck, there's even more. No, is this it? Alright, this is the end. I'm just

690
02:09:00,420 --> 02:09:05,239
gonna get rid of everybody in this room. Is there any special gun I can pick up in here?

691
02:09:05,960 --> 02:09:19,380
I don't think there's anything else. I'm dropping the gun on the ground.

692
02:09:19,380 --> 02:09:25,619
You got some balls coming in here alone, but this is as far as you go. That's how you greet your

693
02:09:25,619 --> 02:09:31,060
guests, is it? You can drop the AK now. Face it, you're already dead. And why are you still

694
02:09:31,060 --> 02:09:37,369
talking to me? Got him. I'll give you 10 seconds to surrender. Maybe I'll let you live.

695
02:09:38,010 --> 02:09:51,619
You're out of your mind. Uh oh. One, two, three, seven, eight, nine, ten.

696
02:09:53,699 --> 02:10:00,279
Hey, how does it feel? How do you like it? I've been playing like that the whole game.

697
02:10:00,279 --> 02:10:15,340
Do you have a problem with that one? I give you... Alright, fine. That's okay.

698
02:10:23,140 --> 02:10:36,659
Sick. Why don't you swing on by and check it out? Anyone there? Click. Wait, those jelly beans?

699
02:10:37,220 --> 02:10:42,600
Come on, those are drugs. Okay, hey boss, take it easy on those pills. You shouldn't

700
02:10:42,600 --> 02:11:12,340
take too many of them. Can I stand up? What the fuck is this? Oh no. You're really gonna

701
02:11:12,340 --> 02:11:18,760
throw Yoshi's Island fucking mushroom level at me right now? This is gonna make me sick.

702
02:11:22,439 --> 02:11:39,859
Oh no. I hate this. Who the fuck are you? Why can I not hit this guy?

703
02:11:47,770 --> 02:11:57,449
Dog has like two heads. Please tell me I can like first try this. This is actually

704
02:11:57,449 --> 02:12:07,930
gonna give me a problem. Alright, come on, let's go. Congratulations, you beat the level.

705
02:12:13,449 --> 02:12:13,949
Uh...

706
02:12:18,789 --> 02:12:30,229
Is that a bear? There's an actual bear in here. What the fuck? What? Okay, I get...

707
02:12:42,539 --> 02:12:47,979
No, I get it. I get it. Well, actually, I don't get it. I'll get it if something else happens.

708
02:12:48,539 --> 02:13:05,180
Alright, wait. So this is... Alright, this is... I get it. I get it. I understand it.

709
02:13:08,199 --> 02:13:30,199
What? Gotta get a grip. Gar. Uh-oh, windows. Of course. Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.

710
02:13:35,029 --> 02:13:39,350
Yeah, alright. He's on a... This is... This happened in like the third level, didn't it?

711
02:13:44,039 --> 02:13:54,199
I get it. No, I get it. That was like the zebra. What is that? Uh, I guess I'm gonna...

712
02:13:54,840 --> 02:14:06,260
Does that explosion hurt me? I apologize to those of you that are, you know,

713
02:14:06,260 --> 02:14:30,699
photo-sensitive to this kind of shit. I don't even know if I'm shooting this. Was that a tiger?

714
02:14:31,340 --> 02:14:54,060
Did I win? I did. That's it. Keep going. I got an axe. Um, I don't remember bats.

715
02:14:58,520 --> 02:15:02,279
Oh no, it's the two ducks. Okay, it's the... It's my favorite character! Ooh.

716
02:15:03,079 --> 02:15:27,689
That's my favorite character. Or two characters. Uh, alright. Oh, ffff...

717
02:15:28,649 --> 02:15:41,020
Alright, it's just doing a gigantic fire-breathing dragon. Oh my goodness. Um,

718
02:15:42,220 --> 02:15:56,810
I killed one of them before. Dodge it? Easier said than done. Are they immune to damage?

719
02:16:07,350 --> 02:16:27,000
Oh, okay. I see. Holy fuck. Alright, so I can only hurt them at a specific time. Oh man.

720
02:16:30,039 --> 02:16:57,139
When can I hit you? Do it! Sorry, swans. Whoops. Do I need that? I hope not. Is this the end

721
02:16:57,139 --> 02:17:11,079
of the game? That's it? Okay, that's the end of the game. No, the last game had a post-credits

722
02:17:11,079 --> 02:17:21,860
chapter, right? That's probably what's gonna happen. Well, yeah, the ending was not actually

723
02:17:21,860 --> 02:17:31,260
the ending. Out of chronological order. Uh, so I... I have no idea what the fuck that game was.

724
02:17:31,979 --> 02:17:38,649
I have no idea what happened. I have a general understanding of kind of what happened,

725
02:17:38,649 --> 02:17:53,319
but I don't think I do. There's a video on YouTube that greatly explains it all.

726
02:17:58,520 --> 02:18:07,750
Because that was- that was the son of the first game boss. And they were all part- they were

727
02:18:07,750 --> 02:18:25,270
all in a military troop together, right? First game is Jacket, and no, the- the- the son- that

728
02:18:25,270 --> 02:18:30,600
son wasn't like part of the group. But I'm talking about the whole thing. There was so

729
02:18:30,600 --> 02:18:35,959
many characters- one guy was a serial killer? Alright, so Evan, what's your opinion? Do you

730
02:18:35,959 --> 02:18:40,950
think there's any truth to his claims of a conspiracy? I couldn't find any substantial

731
02:18:40,950 --> 02:18:44,790
proof of a conspiracy, but my research strongly indicates that there might have been one.

732
02:18:45,350 --> 02:18:51,190
Hopefully my book will get people to start asking questions. Perhaps a more thorough

733
02:18:51,190 --> 02:18:55,110
investigation can be conducted in the future. You're implying that the official investigation

734
02:18:55,110 --> 02:18:59,270
wasn't thorough? From the police reports I've seen, the investigation was a complete mess.

735
02:18:59,989 --> 02:19:03,030
A lot of stones were left unturned, so many questions left unanswered.

736
02:19:03,590 --> 02:19:06,389
I really hope we'll get to the bottom of the whole incident one day.

737
02:19:07,270 --> 02:19:09,510
And when can we expect to read this book of?

738
02:19:11,670 --> 02:19:14,700
We are interrupting the program for an emergency broadcast, the president of the

739
02:19:14,700 --> 02:19:19,190
united states has been assassinated. A press conference in washington was uninterrupted by

740
02:19:19,190 --> 02:19:24,629
a league of armed men during what appears to be a coup d'etat. The president was shot and

741
02:19:24,629 --> 02:19:28,309
killed, the russian president was also shot dead in the chaos that ensued- what?

742
02:19:28,309 --> 02:19:32,790
The ringleader of the uprising appears to be a u.s army general- in this time no official

743
02:19:32,790 --> 02:19:36,979
statements have been made experts believe this will be seen as an act of

744
02:19:36,979 --> 02:19:40,780
war against Russia the fear of repercussions may be severe stay tuned

745
02:19:40,780 --> 02:19:47,819
as we will be purporting live from looks like you've gotten yourself quite

746
02:19:47,819 --> 02:19:51,700

748
02:19:57,950 --> 02:20:03,809
feeling things would catch up with me are they on to me oh no this this

749
02:20:03,809 --> 02:20:10,299
is much worse how long do I have you you don't have much time no one

750
02:20:10,299 --> 02:20:15,059
does there's nothing I can do about it right no by now there's nothing anyone

751
02:20:15,059 --> 02:20:23,100
can do about it okay no need to fight it then I'm glad you understand leaving

752

03:40:29,360 --> 03:40:32,659
elevator

1097
03:40:33,739 --> 03:40:43,170
silence I mean I had to be silent there there's no way I'm gonna well that's

1098

1100
03:41:19,239 --> 03:41:33,030
friend over here got it that was tricky that was very fun though very tricky

1101
03:41:33,030 --> 03:41:51,579
but very fun dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot that's not the car that's

1102
03:41:51,579 --> 03:42:08,440
not my car you sure this is not my car what it's where you came in I have

1103
03:42:08,440 --> 03:42:13,290
I mean you think I remember that I can't write it is this level is like 25

1104
03:42:13,290 --> 03:42:38,239
minutes I don't remember what happened it's not it right this is the

1105
03:42:38,239 --> 03:42:42,159
hardest part of the game is like just trying to find the car there's like

1106
03:42:42,159 --> 03:42:47,729
six levels here why I guess I'm gonna go up the stairs should I be

1107
03:42:47,729 --> 03:42:51,209
going down the stairs we're going the elevator and then down the stairs

1108
03:42:51,209 --> 03:43:07,790
why does it keep wanting me to do that and this is down it's hard to

1109
03:43:07,790 --> 03:43:16,590
even tell which one is up and down I'm all the way up now this could

1110
03:43:16,629 --> 03:43:32,819
be either one this could be up or down I love tongue twisters north side of the

1111
03:43:32,819 --> 03:43:35,899
bottom floor is this does the elevator take me to the bottom floor

1112
03:43:35,899 --> 03:43:47,100
because this is the top floor now I have absolutely no idea where I am all

1113
03:43:47,100 --> 03:44:10,200
right found it I accidentally just found it that was fun so that takes

1114
03:44:10,200 --> 03:44:14,440

1186
04:02:42,750 --> 04:02:48,690
he's taking care of one more patrol coming down he's getting impatient I

1187
04:02:48,690 --> 04:02:59,100
know that should be enough of that I can actually walk over here now I'm

1188
04:02:59,100 --> 04:03:04,709
not sure I want to they're gonna come oh fuck there's another dog oh fuck all

1189
04:03:04,709 --> 04:03:23,229
right where you go it's the disco diaper lying down still there and I

1190
04:03:23,229 --> 04:03:30,959

1192
04:03:42,500 --> 04:03:58,520
beers yes up here is this one dude and then the two beers and that should

1193
04:03:58,520 --> 04:04:16,659
bring me to I gotta get it easy hits here got it who oh this one person

1194
04:04:16,659 --> 04:04:26,860
remains wait glass no but you're trying to fool me with the glass got

1195
04:04:26,860 --> 04:04:41,500
it that was compact that was the was great I know how to get out of this

1196
04:04:41,700 --> 04:05:07,879
hardest part of the level that was fantastic thank you for that B plus that

1197
04:05:07,879 --> 04:05:12,260
was a lot of work that went in a lot of work went into all these excellent job

1198
04:05:12,260 --> 04:05:28,299
so that leaves us with patrol and pain train as we do patrol oh don't worry

1199
04:05:28,299 --> 04:05:35,239
I'll get Garfield we'll do Garfield before I turn the stream off Garfield

1200
04:05:35,239 --> 04:05:57,129
will be the last one that I attempt so let's do patrol by plank all

1201
04:05:57,170 --> 04:06:07,780
right so that's me sniper rifle I can't shoot I can't just rewind I can't rewind

1202
04:06:07,780 --> 04:06:29,690
no rewinds are allowed actually actual game mechanic all right let's try a

1203
04:06:29,690 --> 04:06:50,219
different approach here give me an open door really whoa what who saw me what

1204
04:06:50,219 --> 04:06:58,680
the hell was that this guy shot me through there I have no idea who's

1205
04:06:58,680 --> 04:07:24,079
shooting me who's shooting me what is he standing up is it it's a turret bush

1206
04:07:24,079 --> 04:07:40,319
it's not this guy is it is it this guy I don't know maybe we'll find him

1207
04:07:40,319 --> 04:07:56,840
later I like the sniping aspect of it oh I got that thought that was a wall

1208
04:07:56,840 --> 04:08:18,639
so I can snipe you from here okay it leaves who that guy right there what

1209
04:08:18,639 --> 04:08:32,819
the hell is oh can I even kill these guys I think these guys and I think these

1210
04:08:32,819 --> 04:08:41,180
guys are turrets I think that's that that's actually by design I think I'm

1211
04:08:41,180 --> 04:08:48,219
pretty sure maybe I can melee the turrets because if I go like this oh

1212
04:08:48,219 --> 04:08:57,959
boy he's just not turning well wouldn't I be able to shoot him then

1213
04:08:57,959 --> 04:09:24,569
like he's no that those guys are definitely supposed to stay alive so I

1214
04:09:24,569 --> 04:09:27,149
can't go this way I gotta go the other way once I take out the this

1215
04:09:27,149 --> 04:09:32,120
big dude once the big dude is dead what about it this way I guess I can wrap

1216
04:09:32,120 --> 04:09:43,200
around you know I can't I'm supposed to get in there this guy shoots through

1217
04:09:43,200 --> 04:09:59,959
here I gotta get a good spot to shoot this guy hmm I'm the let's see all

1218
04:09:59,959 --> 04:10:11,590
right now I wonder if I can just walk up here and then down huh whoa

1219
04:10:11,590 --> 04:10:21,559
melee melee melee melee well I have to get close enough before I can do

1220
04:10:21,559 --> 04:10:52,520
that gonna take these guys out again let's try it again okay I'm gonna try

1221
04:10:52,520 --> 04:11:09,620
doing that again I have to shoot this dude now get in here but um I can't

1222
04:11:09,620 --> 04:11:12,559
stand here you can shoot through the door I feel like you shot through the

1223
04:11:12,559 --> 04:11:31,030
door last time no it was somebody else oh fuck man I think I can so who

1224
04:11:31,030 --> 04:11:35,430
is who is this which I don't know guys shooting me because this guy

1225
04:11:35,430 --> 04:11:51,530
dies where's the other big guy he's right there so I'm gonna I'm gonna have

1226
04:11:51,530 --> 04:12:09,950
to snipe through this hole I feel like I kind of have to how do I line that

1227
04:12:09,950 --> 04:12:21,719
up is he gonna shoot me if I go like that through there maybe but I think

1228
04:12:21,719 --> 04:12:26,209
that's gonna be hard to get over there I think I can do it from like

1229
04:12:26,209 --> 04:12:37,959
a better angle I don't think so I'm gonna have to run in and shoot

1230
04:12:37,959 --> 04:12:44,969
through here right like this what the fuck who the hell are why are you

1231
04:12:44,969 --> 04:13:05,139
standing whoa what that just scraped my brain what the hell I actually all

1232
04:13:05,139 --> 04:13:15,180
right so fuck just come out here so I can figure this out again what in the

1233
04:13:15,180 --> 04:13:18,340
name of God all right so they have to melee that guy and they they're not

1234
04:13:18,340 --> 04:13:46,190
just turrets they're not turrets so I I didn't even shoot that guy all

1235
04:13:46,229 --> 04:13:54,110
right here we go again so now maybe I should just shoot the wall and bait

1236
04:13:54,110 --> 04:14:13,120
this guy okay that changes things I just just shoot him just shoot the fucking

1237
04:14:13,120 --> 04:14:29,639
guy well the reason I thought it was a

1238
04:14:29,639 --> 04:14:32,079
turret is because they were shooting backwards and they weren't doing any

1239
04:14:32,079 --> 04:14:40,940
animations so I mean what am I supposed to think all right let's take

1240
04:14:40,940 --> 04:14:52,889
a look I don't there's any way I can get shot in here it's gonna pick

1241
04:14:52,889 --> 04:15:33,600
this guy off fucking dumb door really you give me a break so then fuck it just

1242
04:15:33,600 --> 04:15:38,829
do this why would I ever even do this just attack them they're not like

1243
04:15:38,829 --> 04:15:47,379
turrets to just go like this and then maybe I can go in that room now

1244
04:15:47,379 --> 04:16:05,530
someone snuck up on me there all right then you're here I think

1245
04:16:05,530 --> 04:16:15,430
somebody's coming out here I can't get off that okay so now I'm safe to go

1246
04:16:15,430 --> 04:16:18,629
up here and into this room because this guy's not here anymore so let me

1247
04:16:18,629 --> 04:16:33,450
see what's available up here hmm I guess I could just pull them but this

1248
04:16:33,450 --> 04:16:45,090
takes a while to switch back I gotta be careful okay anybody have line of sight

1249
04:16:45,090 --> 04:16:57,649
no but this guy is he stand I don't is that guy standing no not anymore okay

1250
04:16:57,649 --> 04:17:24,350
much left one guy no more than one guy I'll wait for you and leaves just

1251
04:17:24,350 --> 04:17:51,950
to you sorry well okay let's try this way whoa all right I think I have to pull

1252
04:17:51,950 --> 04:18:17,559
you first the right idea really you saw me through here there's one more

1253
04:18:17,559 --> 04:18:24,329
guy over there but see if I can kill this dude right now hmm nowhere I'm

1254
04:18:24,329 --> 04:18:55,719
gonna go this way really it sucks there a guy with melee that was down

1255
04:18:55,719 --> 04:19:29,649
there no god what the fuck I'm trying to right-click okay gotta get the fat

1256
04:19:29,649 --> 04:20:03,110
guy here just bait these guys I can kill them what killed me what did I

1257
04:20:03,110 --> 04:20:16,500

1258
04:20:16,500 --> 04:20:37,850

1259
04:20:37,850 --> 04:20:49,719
boy let's kill me I have to wait till he stands but I can't see when he

1260
04:20:49,719 --> 04:21:32,510
stands I can't move give me a break happens every fucking time let's try

1261
04:21:32,510 --> 04:21:46,959
this again so one of these guys has a gun I got a slow down I don't have

1262
04:21:46,959 --> 04:21:51,420
any ammo oh no that's not good is there ammo down here somewhere is

1263
04:21:51,420 --> 04:22:04,250

1280
04:26:39,030 --> 04:26:42,149
and see if I can bait him to stand up which I did and I didn't shoot him

1281
04:26:42,149 --> 04:26:58,690

1285
04:27:25,399 --> 04:27:37,879
thinking of them whatever oh now I'm just rushing god damn it for some

1286
04:27:37,879 --> 04:27:41,479
reason I don't know why my brain right there I just like that guy was

1287

a melee cuz like I said oh melee that's a melee guy kill this guy

1288
04:27:52,799 --> 04:27:58,200
right now and also after you shoot it takes a full almost two seconds before I

1289
04:27:58,200 --> 04:28:25,059
can switch back to the knife so and I'm not compensating for that all right

1290
04:28:25,059 --> 04:28:41,719
where the hell am I gonna shoot here I gotta shoot him what the fuck why did

1291
04:28:41,719 --> 04:28:46,139

1314
04:33:07,470 --> 04:33:14,310

05:26:58,029 --> 05:27:02,299
an elevator oh okay I'm just following the red arrows just following the red

1585
05:27:41,540 --> 05:27:44,979
Garfield think about what you're doing remember all the good times we

1586
05:27:44,979 --> 05:27:53,750
like like the time I drank ha ha ha all the wacky times remember those yeah I do

1587
05:27:53,750 --> 05:28:18,459
so thanks for all the years that's it hey Garfield oh hi Tony they're showing

1588
05:28:18,459 --> 05:28:22,060
the fly on TV why am I still have my eyes bucket out of my head

1589
05:28:22,060 --> 05:28:32,319
oh that's a good movie grab a cold one son you know they shot an alternate

1590
05:28:32,319 --> 05:28:38,240
ending for this oh yeah yeah Veronica has a dream of her baby with

1591
05:28:38,240 --> 05:28:42,680
butterfly wings oh that's beautiful especially after all the gruesome things

1592
05:28:42,680 --> 05:29:00,549
yeah it's kind of burp well there we go I love the Garfield created by Jim

1593
05:29:00,549 --> 05:29:08,080
Davis you notice the continuity error in this campaign by the way 21st as

1594
05:29:08,080 --> 05:29:10,479
he's thankful of being unemployed but later he says he's jealous of people

1595
05:29:10,479 --> 05:29:12,560
who have jobs that kind of shit happens when you work without notepad

1596
05:29:12,560 --> 05:29:15,200
and don't write down your story apparently or is it a continuity or

1597
05:29:15,200 --> 05:29:18,439
maybe Tony was just trying to impress his whole friends sadly we

1598
05:29:18,439 --> 05:29:20,439
might never know the true background of this mystery nevertheless I hope you

1599
05:29:20,439 --> 05:29:22,400
enjoyed and check out my other campaigns a brave man is a man who

1600
05:29:22,400 --> 05:29:28,520
dares to look the devil in the face James Garfield

1601
05:29:30,610 --> 05:29:42,939
well that was outrageous it was absolutely outrageous I think that's a

1602
05:29:42,939 --> 05:29:55,590
great one to go out on well Garfield actually said that all those it's a

1603
05:29:55,909 --> 05:30:07,680
actually surprising to see just how high quality and worthy of being in the game

1604
05:30:07,680 --> 05:30:16,400
type of content that people are making and I don't think I even scratched the

1605
05:30:16,400 --> 05:30:23,639
surface there's a lot to bet you were too cowardly to read half the story

1606
05:30:23,639 --> 05:30:35,860
I'm not going to play the Shrek one maybe one day you'll just know I'm

1607
05:30:35,860 --> 05:30:40,630
not gonna not playing Shrek you can call me a coward all you want I'm

1608
05:30:40,709 --> 05:31:44,400
gonna play the Shrek campaign coward coward coward coward coward I can't

1609
05:31:44,400 --> 05:31:59,979
believe John drank dog no I'm not saying it my god no all right no

1610
05:31:59,979 --> 05:32:04,500
that's not a coward because I don't want to say I guess if I say that then

1611
05:32:04,500 --> 05:32:43,740
I get to be edited in a hundred thousand different ways I don't what a

1612
05:32:43,740 --> 05:33:02,779
load of bullshit well time all right that hey good night everybody that's

1613
05:33:02,779 --> 05:33:14,909
where we're gonna end thanks for coming out to the stream that's where

1614
05:33:14,909 --> 05:33:23,119
we're gonna end see you next time it's just an expression what's saying

1615
05:33:23,119 --> 05:33:32,200
I'm going to go jack it I'm concerned for the future of content and when I

1616
05:33:32,200 --> 05:33:49,700
press them when I click the button I gotta take a break I do I can't play

1617
05:33:49,700 --> 05:33:54,770
this game for more than like six hours it's a great game maybe maybe you'll

1618
05:33:54,770 --> 05:33:59,229
see Shrek start the next stream so I don't know what the hell I'm gonna do

1619
05:33:59,229 --> 05:34:04,740
tomorrow I have to come up with something because my plan was I was

1620
05:34:04,740 --> 05:34:15,849
gonna play Atlas tomorrow but that has been delayed so we'll figure

1621
05:34:16,450 --> 05:34:24,459
I have a couple of potential ideas play Shrek all right I will play I will play

1622
05:34:24,459 --> 05:34:29,189
this Shrek campaign tomorrow okay but we're not but doing something else

1623
05:34:29,189 --> 05:34:37,709
after that somebody just in all capitals called me a liar well then

1624
05:34:37,709 --> 05:34:43,259
you're gonna have to tune in tomorrow we got him no you don't I get but I

1625
05:34:43,259 --> 05:34:52,599
didn't say how long I was gonna play it for why you make this this

1626
05:34:52,599 --> 05:34:58,360
campaign probably took like 30 hours of work to make you know it's not

1627
05:34:58,360 --> 05:35:02,560
fucking I'm making my own campaign I'm gonna make my own hotline Miami to

1628
05:35:02,560 --> 05:35:20,590
campaign and we're gonna play it it's gonna be terrible but good night

1629
05:35:20,590 --> 05:35:26,180
everybody I'll see you tomorrow final thoughts on hotline Miami as a series

1630
05:35:26,180 --> 05:35:35,099
there's a great series the first one I enjoyed a little more than the second

1631
05:35:35,099 --> 05:35:39,659
ones campaign but the second had way more content and much more to do it

1632
05:35:39,659 --> 05:35:45,479
was way harder both very very good games I would highly recommend them

1633
05:35:45,520 --> 05:35:58,639
wrong overlay oops well that was embarrassing two has the better music I

1634
05:35:58,639 --> 05:36:04,619
mean they're both great I would probably say if the first one's not as

1635
05:36:04,619 --> 05:36:11,130
difficult as the second one second one's a lot larger there's a lot more

1636
05:36:11,130 --> 05:36:18,139
enemies people are off-screen there's a lot more windows and more doors I like

1637
05:36:18,139 --> 05:36:26,299
this new end stream that's right it's just pulling from Shrek and there's

1638
05:36:26,299 --> 05:36:29,819
a the two is worth purchasing for all the community content for sure there's

1639
05:36:29,819 --> 05:36:41,389
so much you know Shrek and Garfield themed campaigns but with that we are

1640
05:36:41,389 --> 05:36:50,310
going to wrap it up we're gonna do the bits and let's actually put on the real

1641
05:36:50,310 --> 05:36:53,709
goodbye music what do you say because this is this is a little too upbeat I

1642
05:36:53,709 --> 05:36:59,659
think there we go but I'll see you guys tomorrow if you're taking off

1643

1690
05:42:01,799 --> 05:42:13,310
that's gonna have weight to it right there are there are channel pins

05:42:30,930 --> 05:42:35,459
picked but we're gonna have a bunch of random shit to open I remember we

1696
05:42:35,459 --> 05:42:40,459
talked about this a few weeks ago oh wouldn't that be funny if chat and the

1697
05:42:40,459 --> 05:42:44,860
mods kind of just bought a bunch of stuff on Amazon and I opened it this

1698
05:42:44,860 --> 05:42:49,900
is kind of part of that so should be a lot of fun I have no idea what

1699
05:42:49,900 --> 05:42:51,700
they're gonna be I'm gonna make sure I don't see it Kim's gonna wrap

1700

05:42:56,819 --> 05:43:02,409
them on my Amazon but Kim's going to do it so I'm not gonna know what they are

1702
05:43:02,409 --> 05:43:10,970

1703
05:43:10,970 --> 05:43:18,409
bugs no perishable food no shit no bad stuff they're rules you got to read

1757
05:50:02,529 --> 05:50:10,639
travel large commitment London in Europe well you know what I mean

egg thanks for the one dollar why do you get your blood removed often are

1761
05:50:31,400 --> 05:50:43,119
you okay I have been struggling with an annoying thing for about six months I

1762
05:50:43,119 --> 05:50:47,979
don't know what it is and I'm not going just like oh hey this is what

1763
05:50:47,979 --> 05:50:51,869
this is the problem I don't know all I know is like I've told you guys

1764
05:50:51,909 --> 05:50:57,830
over the last three or four streams I've been trying to eat a different diet

1765
05:50:57,830 --> 05:51:01,430
I've been trying to stay away from gluten to see if that helps but I've

1766
05:51:01,430 --> 05:51:06,509
been having some weird stomach and back and chest pain for about six

1767
05:51:06,509 --> 05:51:12,770
months and that's why I've kind of been at the doctor a lot to try to

1768
05:51:12,770 --> 05:51:15,330
figure out what the fuck is going on with my body and why it's doing

1769
05:51:15,330 --> 05:51:26,340
this and there's been stay healthy no I'm fine don't worry about me but if

1770
05:51:26,380 --> 05:51:28,979
you're wondering why I'll go to the doctor well I can't stream tomorrow I

1771
05:51:28,979 --> 05:51:44,560
gotta I gotta go to the doctor I need to eat Flintstones but it's

1772
05:51:44,560 --> 05:51:52,110
potentially something as simple as too much bad bacteria and that would be

1773
05:51:52,110 --> 05:52:00,000
really really great if it was because that's very easy to fix but

1774
05:52:00,000 --> 05:52:03,419
if that's some really just strange medical happenings that really has

1775
05:52:03,419 --> 05:52:18,060
nothing to do with my intestines quick send him taffy see I would feel

1776
05:52:18,060 --> 05:52:26,900
so much better if I had some taffy no all jokes aside I'll figure it out

1777
05:52:26,900 --> 05:52:35,299
don't worry about me I'm fine but I am there I did I have been at the doctor

1778

1783
05:53:09,209 --> 05:53:11,290
your video since the beginning and you've always had the ability to help

1784
05:53:11,290 --> 05:53:14,569
with my depression and make me feel better without fail I'm at the lowest

1785
05:53:14,569 --> 05:53:19,250
point in my life so far and I want to hear what advice you might have

1786
05:53:19,250 --> 05:53:23,669
love you and I'm glad I've never you've never stopped making me laugh

1787
05:53:25,549 --> 05:53:36,349
it's the same advice that I I say kind of often right that's sometimes you

1788
05:53:36,349 --> 05:53:43,340
might feel pretty fucking low right now right but you got to take each day

1789
05:53:43,340 --> 05:53:52,409
at a time is slow it doesn't happen overnight it takes a while but as long

1790
05:53:52,409 --> 05:53:56,090
as every day or every you know once a week once every few days you're

1791
05:53:56,090 --> 05:54:02,349
really trying to either better yourself or try to figure out why it's

1792
05:54:02,389 --> 05:54:18,110
not easy and I always feel I always feel for people that you know say this

1793
05:54:18,110 --> 05:54:24,150
kind of shit because you know I've been there you guys have heard the stories

1794
05:54:24,150 --> 05:54:30,750
before I've felt like fucking shit before you know ten years ago or so

1795
05:54:30,750 --> 05:54:57,650
you just got to try you know you're so sweet chairman no I mean I but I

1796
05:54:57,650 --> 05:55:03,799
want also to you know have people realize that there isn't just a simple

1797
05:55:03,799 --> 05:55:07,000
hope this is how you fix it that's it it's all fucked up that's how you fix

1798
05:55:07,000 --> 05:55:11,159
it because everybody's so different you everybody has such different wildly

1799
05:55:11,159 --> 05:55:15,799
different personalities viewpoints beliefs things that they like this

1800
05:55:15,799 --> 05:55:21,200
they don't like that it's it's hard somebody a problems right different

1801
05:55:21,200 --> 05:55:26,099
problems there's a lot of different points you can come from so it's

1802
05:55:26,099 --> 05:55:43,319
very very difficult because there's so many ways takes time to get over it

1803
05:55:43,319 --> 05:55:50,389
it does but I really do wish you the best hopefully you get it all

1804
05:55:50,389 --> 05:56:06,400
figured out much love to you somebody said therapy therapy

1805
05:56:06,400 --> 05:56:11,680
helps yeah if it's something you think would help you could get out there

1806
05:56:11,680 --> 05:56:20,409
start talking to somebody because you never really want to have it just kind

1807
05:56:20,409 --> 05:56:27,580
of sit there and just wallow inside over and over and over again it's

1808
05:56:27,580 --> 05:56:36,110
it's not healthy you know it really is better to at least have somebody

1809
05:56:36,110 --> 05:56:41,400
that either knows or is a professional and I'm not a professional at all that's

1810
05:56:41,400 --> 05:56:46,680
another thing I guess we need to address is I can only tell you the

1811
05:56:46,680 --> 05:56:50,240
things that have helped me or the things that I think are a good idea

1812
05:56:50,240 --> 05:56:59,689
but at the end of the day I'm not really equipped for it but I really do

1813
05:56:59,689 --> 05:57:06,880
wish you the best hopefully you figure it out soon takes time I am a

1814
05:57:06,880 --> 05:57:10,200
professional streamer oh well I'm not a professional therapist or a

1815
05:57:10,200 --> 05:57:21,099
psychiatrist so there is that not a professional gamer I've never went if I

1816

and that's why I don't get it I was born in 1991 so how could I be a boomer

1921
06:10:33,430 --> 06:10:47,090
that's a song that has a 1.5 billion views I mean if you have a YouTube

1922
06:10:47,090 --> 06:10:49,650
channel that gets to a point where you have more views than people on

1923
06:10:49,650 --> 06:10:58,799
earth I don't even that's that's and that's like God status if you have

1924

swearing my 13 children watch this channel hashtag charity I can't I'm

1965
06:16:08,599 --> 06:16:14,099
sorry just every time you feel yawning I told you fucking they took

1966
06:16:14,099 --> 06:16:19,750
too much blood so are you gonna let me ask you guys guys be like this

1967
06:16:19,750 --> 06:16:29,560
because I'm like this when I go to the doctor and I get my blood taken and you

1968
06:16:29,560 --> 06:16:35,040
sit there I've by the way I've never seen ever I've never seen a needle go

1969
06:16:35,040 --> 06:16:41,369
into my arm I've never looked at it I don't know what it looks like I have

1970
06:16:41,369 --> 06:16:44,889
no idea what the mechanism is I just know that it hurts for a second and

1971
06:16:44,889 --> 06:16:52,599
that's it and I don't look it changes oh yep I don't ever want to

1972
06:16:52,599 --> 06:16:58,220
know so what I do is I did this little technique that right when the needles

1973
06:16:58,220 --> 06:17:04,060
about to go in for either a shot or for blood work I will take my index finger

1974
06:17:04,060 --> 06:17:07,220
and I'll put it on my let's say I'm getting blood drawn from my left arm

1975
06:17:07,220 --> 06:17:11,860
I'll put my index finger down on my right knee and I just got just give a

1976
06:17:11,860 --> 06:17:15,099
little bit of a little scratch little little scratch scratch on my

1977
06:17:15,099 --> 06:17:19,279
right knee not hard or anything because it tricks your brain once it

1978
06:17:19,279 --> 06:17:22,259
goes you know okay they say here comes the pinch I just start

1979
06:17:22,259 --> 06:17:27,020
scratching and then you it your brain doesn't know where to feel a sensation

1980
06:17:27,020 --> 06:17:32,639
so you're kind of like messes with your brain anyways after the first because I

1981
06:17:32,639 --> 06:17:36,000
had to get like seven vials taken out of me and that I saw that and I

1982
06:17:36,000 --> 06:17:40,919
was like oh okay well I'll be alright after one vial you kind of just sit

1983
06:17:40,919 --> 06:17:45,159
in there and you say okay everything's fine they got that's the one vial I

1984
06:17:45,159 --> 06:17:50,599
usually only have like one or two vials take after the third vial I

1985
06:17:50,599 --> 06:17:56,599
could really start to feel like they were draining my life force vial number

1986
06:17:56,599 --> 06:18:01,200
four and five I could just you know when you're getting blood taken and you

1987
06:18:01,200 --> 06:18:05,360
just talk to like the nurse or the nurse practitioner and you hate every

1988
06:18:05,360 --> 06:18:10,240
second of it so uh how you know you just move here yeah yeah I just moved

1989
06:18:10,240 --> 06:18:16,840
here great place oh cool so what are you into I died I like

1990
06:18:16,840 --> 06:18:22,040
hamburgers please let me alone leave me the fuck alone you just

1991
06:18:22,040 --> 06:18:25,119
don't want to talk you just I hate that because I always feel like I have to

1992
06:18:25,119 --> 06:18:30,000
put on like a show because I'm like panicking internally and I'm trying as

1993
06:18:30,000 --> 06:18:33,759
hard as I can to focus on trying not to panic internally and now I have to

1994
06:18:33,759 --> 06:18:42,650
tell you what my favorite food is and at like vial number six and seven I

1995
06:18:42,650 --> 06:18:46,930
don't like I don't care about needles they don't scare me I'm not

1996
06:18:46,930 --> 06:18:51,849
scared of having my blood taken or having a shot or anything but you

1997
06:18:51,849 --> 06:18:54,209
kind of psych yourself up after you've been sitting there for about

1998
06:18:54,209 --> 06:19:02,819
five minutes and I've never given blood before I they take like at least

1999
06:19:02,819 --> 06:19:08,599
I think two or three times what I had taken out of me yesterday and at at

2000
06:19:08,599 --> 06:19:12,799
that seventh file I remember like the world was kind of starting to close in

2001
06:19:12,799 --> 06:19:18,099
and it wasn't because I was scared of the needle it was because I think

2002
06:19:18,099 --> 06:19:21,299
they were just taking I think they were just taking all my blood you

2003
06:19:21,299 --> 06:19:31,139
know I'm sitting there like they're taking too much I think here we go

2004
06:19:31,139 --> 06:19:35,220
I'm starting to feel it I'm going out no no everything's fine everything's fine

2005
06:19:35,220 --> 06:19:41,000

a free FPS that's on Steam that everybody knows is a really good game

it empathy is I don't know nobody ever wants to watch somebody not have

2207
06:45:11,110 --> 06:45:16,090
a good time be feel bad about themselves or their life you know I

2208
06:45:16,650 --> 06:45:33,759
genuinely it makes me feel fucking bad so because I take a look at you know the

2209
06:45:33,759 --> 06:45:39,279
things that have happened in my life and where I've gone and where I want to

2210
06:45:39,279 --> 06:45:46,830
go and where I've been and it's um we all we're all doing this together

2211
06:45:46,830 --> 06:45:53,279
we're all doing it in the same time you know and I would feel terrible if

2212
06:45:53,279 --> 06:45:56,799
I just kind of wrote this type of stuff off is like yeah whatever oh

2213
06:45:58,599 --> 06:46:01,959

2214
06:46:01,959 --> 06:46:07,119

06:46:07,119 --> 06:46:19,450
that people can come here and enjoy themselves some people I know do like

2216
06:46:19,450 --> 06:46:27,130
watching me suffer it's so it's a comfort when you care that just

2217
06:46:27,130 --> 06:46:45,240
shouldn't be how it is that just shouldn't be the way it is and I don't

2218
06:46:45,240 --> 06:46:50,159
think it is I think it's just like a people thing I mean I I always feel

2219
06:46:50,159 --> 06:46:55,299
terrible when somebody just doesn't feel like good enough doesn't feel

2220
06:46:55,299 --> 06:47:07,860
fucking smart enough doesn't feel good enough doesn't feel liked or don't

2221
06:47:07,860 --> 06:47:12,709
worry about what other people think that's tough though you know because

2222
06:47:12,709 --> 06:47:17,590
it's I say the same thing like oh just let things be yeah we know if

2223
06:47:17,590 --> 06:47:20,549
somebody wants to be like a dick about something or if somebody wants to be

like genuinely like and we're not talking about like banter right we're

2225
06:47:24,750 --> 06:47:31,119

feel like that well I do think about it a lot because I've got into this

2227

2316
07:00:44,979 --> 07:00:48,310

2317
07:00:48,310 --> 07:00:58,840
embarrassing and I'm glad I didn't do that joke dropped joke dropped joke

dollar more beatboxes all right same time tomorrow or normal time I don't

2321
07:01:33,959 --> 07:01:40,240
know because of me going to bed and getting up such strange times I'm

2322
07:01:40,240 --> 07:01:49,630
probably gonna I really don't know because there's a chance that I go eat

2323
07:01:49,630 --> 07:01:56,470
food and then go food blood pass out it's possible I'm thinking such a big

2324
07:01:56,470 --> 07:02:01,880
deal out of this I had my blood taken yesterday it's like oh you see the

2325
07:02:01,880 --> 07:02:07,549
thing is I had my blood taken yesterday so I'm gonna go to bed like

2326
07:02:07,549 --> 07:02:12,150
I'm blowing that out of proportion so much I'm over exaggerating that so

2327
07:02:12,150 --> 07:02:23,060
much more beatbox okay but I think probably around the normal time

2328
07:02:23,060 --> 07:02:32,029
because there's a chance that I'll stay up but there's an equal chance

2329
07:02:32,189 --> 07:02:37,069
that I fall asleep in like an hour or two so I really don't know forgive me

2330
07:02:37,069 --> 07:02:41,880
I'm sorry I've kind of screwed up my sleep schedule here yesterday but there

2331
07:02:41,880 --> 07:02:44,639
will be a stream tomorrow at some point will I will figure out when
