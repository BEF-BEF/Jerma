1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:12,910
Dark Carnival, you must be this tall to die.

2
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,910
Oh yeah, baby!

3
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:22,910
Obviously, you can see we're in here with Boo, Burger Boy, of course, MLC Stealth, who is freaking out with a glitch.

4
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:29,339
This is our survival, so we're just jumping right into this here. I have no idea if we're gonna do this or not.

5
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:32,340
Boo, are you gonna throw that firearm on the ground?

6
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,340
This is a strategy.

7
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:38,340
I'm saying we climb up on this here thing over here.

8
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,340
Boo, toss down your ammo and go get a health kit.

9
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,649
Yeah, make sure you have health and pills and boom-a-bile and puke and pee.

10
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:48,649
Ooh, puke.

11
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:49,649
I love puke.

12
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:54,259
Alright, nobody pick up the grenade launcher, that's gonna be bad.

13
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:56,259
Meet Burger.

14
00:00:56,259 --> 00:00:58,820
Hello, everyone.

15
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,990
I was like reading that.

16
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:04,989
Hello, everyone.

17
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:08,420
I was reading that sign that says Meet Burger.

18
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:11,420
Yeah, this is like the first time Burger Boy's been in a video, I think.

19
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,420
I'm trying to jump on top of the corn dogs.

20
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,420
Alright, does that mean you're ready? Okay, cool.

21
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,420
Do we have the little gasket? Oh, never mind.

22
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,420
Everyone hang out up here.

23
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,659
Where did the zombies come from?

24
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:23,659
Oh, jockey gods.

25
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:25,659
Oh god, that was, oh my god.

26
00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:27,659
Spitter, spitter across the way.

27
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:28,659
We're already like dead.

28
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:29,659
No, we're not.

29
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:31,659
Yeah, I've already fallen off.

30
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:34,500
It's alright.

31
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,500
I'm like on fire.

32
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,500
We've just got four minutes, that's it.

33
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,959
Yeah, I'm saving that.

34
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:42,959
I'm coming back up.

35
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:43,959
I'm up.

36
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:45,959
There's pills up here, so heal up and grab some pills.

37
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:48,519
Boom-a-bile.

38
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:55,640
Oh, we just need to, if we survive four minutes, we're super MLG pros.

39
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,640
Oh my god.

40
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,640
I got you, I got you.

41
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,640
I don't like this.

42
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,140
Get off of my bread.

43
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,140
Oh, charge.

44
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,140
Get out of here.

45
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,379
Oh, that didn't take long.

46
00:02:03,379 --> 00:02:05,379
You're almost dead.

47
00:02:05,379 --> 00:02:07,939
You need to heal, bro.

48
00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:10,330
Burning sensation.

49
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,330
Look at me, just achievements all around.

50
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,330
Oh, you're getting a bunch of achievements right now?

51
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,330
By all around, I mean one.

52
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:18,330
Whoa.

53
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,629
That just destroyed.

54
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:21,629
Yeah, we gotta be careful of the spitters, man.

55
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:24,629
The spitter's gonna spit up here and we're gonna be all done.

56
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:26,629
Oh, you mean like that, except he missed.

57
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:29,629
Oh my god, I was just unloading on your back, dude.

58
00:02:29,629 --> 00:02:30,629
I'm sorry.

59
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:31,629
Tank.

60
00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:32,629
Oh, he's throwing a rock.

61
00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:33,629
Tank, where is he?

62
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:34,629
Ow.

63
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:35,629
Just unload on him.

64
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:36,629
He has to climb up here.

65
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:37,629
He has to climb up here.

66
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:38,870
Just destroy him.

67
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,870
All right, get off.

68
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:40,870
Oh, man.

69
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,870
It doesn't have to take too long, does it?

70
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,870
Smack out.

71
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:43,870
There's a hunter around too.

72
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,110
Be careful.

73
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,110
He's going down.

74
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,110
He's down.

75
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,110
Tank dead.

76
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,110
Tank dead.

77
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,110
Oh, god.

78
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,110
Get this.

79
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,110
Oh, I got a jockey on me.

80
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,110
Oh, and a charger, too.

81
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,539
Are you kidding me?

82
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:55,539
I'm over here, screwed.

83
00:02:55,539 --> 00:02:56,539
Oh, shit.

84
00:02:56,539 --> 00:02:57,539
I'm trying to get to you.

85
00:02:57,539 --> 00:02:58,539
Oh, you got boom too.

86
00:02:58,539 --> 00:02:59,539
Boomer and a charger.

87
00:02:59,539 --> 00:03:02,189
Oh, god.

88
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:03,189
Oh, god.

89
00:03:03,189 --> 00:03:06,009
Take your pills if you have them.

90
00:03:06,009 --> 00:03:08,530
Yeah, good throw.

91
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,530
Good throw.

92
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:10,530
Good throw.

93
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,530
Good toss.

94
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:12,530
Are you dead?

95
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:13,530
I'm lying down right here on the ground.

96
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:18,139
Oh, come on, Burger Boy.

97
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:19,139
Tank again.

98
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:20,139
Tank.

99
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:21,139
Oh, my god.

100
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:25,129
Wow.

101
00:03:25,129 --> 00:03:26,129
I'm trying to save you, German.

102
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:31,370
Dude, you just got flushed so far on my screen.

103
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,370
I'll get him.

104
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,370
Don't worry.

105
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,370
He's going down.

106
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,370
Burger Boy, you are like the master of this game.

107
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,250
All right, come on.

108
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,250
Come on.

109
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,250
I'll be the bait.

110
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,250
I'm going down.

111
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,550
I'm dead.

112
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,550
I'm dead.

113
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,550
Another minute and a half.

114
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:52,009
Oh, if anybody can get rid of that tank and somebody picks up the defibs.

115
00:03:52,009 --> 00:03:54,009
Oh, dear lord.

116
00:03:54,009 --> 00:03:57,530
Oh, Burger Boy.

117
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:58,830
I think I got him.

118
00:03:58,830 --> 00:03:59,830
Oh, boo.

119
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:00,830
You get full health.

120
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,830
Boo, I'm like healing and stuff.

121
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:03,830
I am so dead.

122
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:04,830
His tank's dead.

123
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:05,830
He's quieting down a little bit.

124
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,830
Hey, revive me, ML.

125
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,830
ML.

126
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,830
Oh, my charger.

127
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,069
Oh, Hunter.

128
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:14,069
Yeah, that's the end of me.

129
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:15,069
No, no, no, no.

130
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:16,439
Stealth, it's up to you.

131
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:17,439
Oh, you got Burger Boy.

132
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:18,439
Oh, you got Burger Boy.

133
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:20,379
Nice.

134
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:21,379
Burger Boy got a Hunter on him.

135
00:04:21,379 --> 00:04:22,379
And a Spitter right there.

136
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:23,379
Spitter right behind you guys.

137
00:04:23,379 --> 00:04:24,939
Tank.

138
00:04:24,939 --> 00:04:25,939
Oh, dear.

139
00:04:25,939 --> 00:04:28,720
Deary, deary me.

140
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,720
Oh, come on.

141
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,899
I'm coming in all kinds of spit here.

142
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:33,899
Do some crazy techniques.

143
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:34,899
Four minutes.

144
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:35,899
How?

145
00:04:35,899 --> 00:04:36,899
Oh, man.

146
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:37,899
Oh, Stealth.

147
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:38,899
Oh, there's a Hunter coming.

148
00:04:38,899 --> 00:04:39,899
Run around in circles.

149
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:41,579
All right.

150
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:42,579
All right.

151
00:04:42,579 --> 00:04:43,579
Good first attempt.

152
00:04:43,579 --> 00:04:44,579
We almost made it to four minutes.

153
00:04:44,579 --> 00:04:45,579
Charger's coming for you.

154
00:04:45,579 --> 00:04:46,579
Oh.

155
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:47,579
That's it.

156
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:48,579
That's all she wrote.

157
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:49,579
Three and a half.

158
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:50,579
God damn it.

159
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:51,579
That was the best time.

160
00:04:51,579 --> 00:04:55,129
So.

161
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:56,129
I'm terrified.

162
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,129
Me too.

163
00:04:57,129 --> 00:04:58,129
Just hang in that corner.

164
00:04:58,129 --> 00:04:59,129
There's a Jaguar right behind us.

165
00:04:59,129 --> 00:05:00,129
There's a Goldberg to our left right here, too.

166
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:01,129
Oh, God.

167
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:02,129
Smoker hasn't...

168
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:03,129
Oh, never mind.

169
00:05:03,129 --> 00:05:04,129
It failed.

170
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:05,129
All right.

171
00:05:05,129 --> 00:05:06,129
Just get in this corner.

172
00:05:06,129 --> 00:05:07,129
Oh, man.

173
00:05:07,129 --> 00:05:08,129
I'm already stung.

174
00:05:08,129 --> 00:05:09,129
You're good.

175
00:05:09,129 --> 00:05:10,620
You're good.

176
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,620
You're good.

177
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,620
Yes.

178
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,060
All right.

179
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,060
Hop in this corner.

180
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,060
This is it.

181
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,060
When a tank comes, we can...

182
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,860
Oh, come on.

183
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:21,860
We can deal with it.

184
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:22,860
Oh, yeah.

185
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,860
I'm tanking my bile.

186
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,860
Yeah.

187
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,860
When a tank comes, we can...

188
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,860
That's better.

189
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,860
Smoker right there.

190
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,860
Smoker straight ahead.

191
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,860
Oh.

192
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,860
And an idiot that just fell.

193
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,029
All right.

194
00:05:32,029 --> 00:05:33,029
Look at this.

195
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:34,029
Spitter up top on the...

196
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:35,029
Oh, that Spitter's gonna get us.

197
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:36,029
No, she's not.

198
00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:37,029
She's too stupid.

199
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:38,029
Jock's coming to our left.

200
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:39,029
Straight ahead.

201
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:40,029
Tank.

202
00:05:40,029 --> 00:05:41,029
All right.

203
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:42,029
This is where we start to move around.

204
00:05:42,029 --> 00:05:43,269
Boom-a-bile.

205
00:05:43,269 --> 00:05:44,269
I'm throwing it the other way.

206
00:05:44,269 --> 00:05:45,269
Throw it on him.

207
00:05:45,269 --> 00:05:46,269
Oh, I'm an idiot.

208
00:05:46,269 --> 00:05:47,269
Hey, Hunter.

209
00:05:47,269 --> 00:05:48,269
Heads up.

210
00:05:48,269 --> 00:05:49,269
It's all right.

211
00:05:49,269 --> 00:05:50,269
Just focus on the tank.

212
00:05:50,269 --> 00:05:51,269
Spitter.

213
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,540
Tank should be almost dead.

214
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,709
Hunter's dead.

215
00:05:55,709 --> 00:05:56,709
Run, Jerma.

216
00:05:56,709 --> 00:05:58,980
Tank's dead.

217
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,980
Tank's dead.

218
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,819
Regroup.

219
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:03,819
Tank's dead.

220
00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:04,819
Hey, Jocky.

221
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:05,819
Oh, watch out for the Jocko.

222
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:06,819
Jocker.

223
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:08,949
Whatever.

224
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:09,949
All right.

225
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:10,949
Back in the corner.

226
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:12,379
Back in the corner.

227
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:13,939
Oh, is it...

228
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:15,500
Oh, I've been Jocky.

229
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,500
Jocky.

230
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,500
There's somebody back here.

231
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,500
Thanks.

232
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,500
All right.

233
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,500
Good.

234
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,500
Good.

235
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,500
Good.

236
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,500
All right.

237
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,500
This is the best we've done so far.

238
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,680
No one's running around aimlessly in circles dying.

239
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,680
Just about out of ammo, though.

240
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,110
Yeah, we're going to have to make a team ammo run in a second here.

241
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,110
You guys want to do it?

242
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,180
After the next tank.

243
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,180
Get the ammo.

244
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,180
No, actually, yeah.

245
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,180
Where's the ammo?

246
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,180
Let's just go as a team.

247
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,180
I just need the shotgun right here.

248
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,180
I'll smoke right here.

249
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,180
Spitter.

250
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,180
Spitter, actually.

251
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,180
All right.

252
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,180
Go back in the corner.

253
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,180
Back in the corner.

254
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,810
Buma.

255
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:48,810
Back in that good old corner.

256
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,300
Hunter.

257
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,300
Oh, God.

258
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,670
He got right on me.

259
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,670
There's a tank coming.

260
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,300
Oh, dear Lord.

261
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,300
Right next to us.

262
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,300
Right behind us.

263
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,300
He got behind us.

264
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,300
He climbed up behind us.

265
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,790
Holy shit.

266
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:01,790
He's right there.

267
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,970
I threw a Molotov on you guys.

268
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:04,970
I apologize.

269
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:05,970
It's okay.

270
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:06,970
Somebody want to watch my back for one second?

271
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:07,970
Oh, jeez.

272
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:08,970
Oh, I got chargers.

273
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:09,970
Watch my back for one second.

274
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:10,970
No, I'm going to go down.

275
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:11,970
I'm going to kill this charger.

276
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:12,970
Come on.

277
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:13,970
Come on.

278
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:14,970
I'm trying to get something.

279
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:15,970
I just can't believe I got that off.

280
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,399
Oh, a charger downed me.

281
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,399
Oh, come on.

282
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:19,399
The tank's right behind me.

283
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:20,399
I'm done.

284
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,399
Oh, my God.

285
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,399
This is over.

286
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:23,399
We were doing so good.

287
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:24,399
We have to do another.

288
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:25,399
We can't end it on that.

289
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:26,399
That was a good strategy.

290
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,399
No.

291
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:30,399
We didn't even make it to duh.

292
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,399
Oh, my God.

293
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:34,399
Like, where did that charger come from?

294
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,399
We just got our ass washed.
