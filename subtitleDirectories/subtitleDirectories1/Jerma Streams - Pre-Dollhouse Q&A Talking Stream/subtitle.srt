1
00:00:06,459 --> 00:00:10,460
Why can't I tweet this? What's going on?

2
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:15,339
Hello, how are you? Hi. Oh, ads.

3
00:00:15,339 --> 00:00:19,339
No, no ads today.

4
00:00:19,339 --> 00:00:23,339
Is it Echo? Yeah, I'm in a different room.

5
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:30,629
It's probably really loud. Yeah, I'm streaming from my bathroom.

6
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:37,100
It was literally an ad. Well, I can't control that.

7
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:44,020
I'll talk quieter. There we go. Is that better? Bye from the hospital.

8
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:49,969
What a wild week it's been.

9
00:00:49,969 --> 00:00:53,969
I will say it's been very stressful, but I'm very excited.

10
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,270
Toilet cam. What if I do that?

11
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:02,700
Hold on. Does this help at all? Does that change anything?

12
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:08,219
There's not much I can really do about it. It's probably going to be very Echo-y.

13
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:12,719
Did that help? Oh, shit, it did. Oh, I'll just do this then.

14
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:23,790
Just put the mic in your mouth. Let me change a bit there.

15
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,790
I can't tweet this for some reason. I don't know why.

16
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:31,790
Yeah, we're going to talk about the dollhouse. This frame is going to be very short.

17
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:35,790
I envision this will be live for about 20-30 minutes.

18
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,790
There's a lot of work going on behind the scenes.

19
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:43,790
I will tell you that this is literally the coolest fucking thing I've ever seen

20
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:47,790
in the 10 plus years I've been doing Twitch and YouTube.

21
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,790
I am incredibly excited. I couldn't be more excited.

22
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:56,790
So, it's going to be insane.

23
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:04,939
Let me see. Reverb. Let me see what it sounds like. I have these headphones here.

24
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:11,159
Well, yeah, it is pretty...

25
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:15,340
Well, actually, it's not that bad. You can handle it, can't you?

26
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:26,770
Yeah, I'm okay. I want to make that really clear first and foremost.

27
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:43,229
Streaming from... Yeah, I'm in my office right now.

28
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:54,289
Old Jerma. Do I look old?

29
00:02:54,289 --> 00:03:00,689
Why can't I... Hold on. We're going back to the start screen.

30
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:04,689
You look like a podcaster. I was thinking about just eating the microphone, but I don't know.

31
00:03:04,689 --> 00:03:08,689
This is not my mic, so I don't think I want to do that.

32
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:19,580
I'm trying to send a tweet. I'll go over very quickly. Sorry about the echo.

33
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:27,729
Not in my usual setup, as you can probably tell.

34
00:03:27,729 --> 00:03:31,729
This stream, I really want to just kind of reiterate the dollhouse stream.

35
00:03:31,729 --> 00:03:35,729
I announced it, then I went on Ludwig's stream and we talked about some stuff.

36
00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:42,729
Then I had a fucking immediate medical concern that was an annoying process that I just barely finished.

37
00:03:42,729 --> 00:03:47,349
Literally, like yesterday.

38
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:53,349
I'm still kind of dealing with it. I won't give you any details because I don't want anybody to be concerned about this or anything.

39
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:57,349
But I had a little bit of a medical problem that's completely unrelated to the other stuff.

40
00:03:57,349 --> 00:04:02,349
Of course it happens, like a week before a big show like this.

41
00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:07,039
It sounds like a Zoom court meeting.

42
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:16,360
Yeah, I guess.

43
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:20,240
Young man, this is not a joke.

44
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:24,889
Yeah, whatever. Fuck you.

45
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:30,699
And by the way, get some fucking padding on these walls. This is unbearable.

46
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:35,910
It's bugleberry.

47
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:42,579
Let me try to tweet. If I can't tweet it, I can't. I don't know why.

48
00:04:42,579 --> 00:04:50,459
Talking stream. Come on, tweet.

49
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:55,829
There we go. That took long enough.

50
00:04:55,829 --> 00:05:09,100
I'll come back on. Look, I'm here.

51
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:15,060
That's not what I wanted to click. I didn't want to click that.

52
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:19,699
But anyways, hello, how are you?

53
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:27,009
I love how there's stream start, there's face cam, there's desktop capture, there's desktop with face.

54
00:05:27,009 --> 00:05:31,000
And then BRB. And then stream it.

55
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,500
So I probably look tired, because I kind of am.

56
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:43,160
Why am I in the void? Handsome?

57
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,160
Yeah, well, probably not today.

58
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,560
I'll be honest with you.

59
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,930
The mic sucks? Yeah, it does.

60
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:57,410
Here, let me hold onto it.

61
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,410
I feel like the price is right.

62
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:01,410
Does it have one of these mics?

63
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:08,230
Look at how fucking big this is. Hold on, ready?

64
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:18,259
No, that looks like I'm on a podium.

65
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:23,259
Yes, I'm here to accept the award for a small but cool streamer.

66
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:33,500
What the fuck do I care?

67
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,500
A spelling bee.

68
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:41,300
Okay, so let's talk about a few things. This is going to be very quick.

69
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,300
Still going through some medical shit.

70
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:47,300
I'm trying to get it just completely gone by this coming week,

71
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:53,300
because obviously a lot of shit going on here that I can't really be ill for.

72
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,300
And it's not like a cough-cough like I'm sick.

73
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,300
It's something completely different than how I'm dealing with.

74
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,300
And it's annoying, so we'll see how that plays out.

75
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05,300
I feel pretty good now. I feel okay.

76
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,300
Maybe after the streams are over,

77
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,300
I will give a more in-depth detail of what I'm talking about here.

78
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,300
But it's nothing to be majorly concerned about, so don't worry.

79
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,860
The show must go on. We're going to continue.

80
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,860
And the show is going to be crazy.

81
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,860
I want to reiterate something I didn't really talk about too much,

82
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,100
is that we have special guests.

83
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,100
Ludwig is one of them.

84
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,100
We also have Kit Boga is going to be on the stream too,

85
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:36,100
which I only really barely leaked for 14 seconds on Ludwig's stream last week.

86
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,100
So Kit Boga is going to be there.

87
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,899
And I can't wait to do that.

88
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:43,899
I can't wait to just have Kit, can't wait to have Ludwig on the streams.

89
00:07:43,899 --> 00:07:46,899
It's going to be the funnest thing I've ever done in my entire life.

90
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:51,829
So having a new medical problem is fucking annoying.

91
00:07:51,829 --> 00:07:57,949
It was a testicular tortusion.

92
00:07:57,949 --> 00:08:04,560
Does that mean that I got like a testicular contusion?

93
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,339
Yeah, I don't want to talk about it, guys.

94
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:14,339
I slammed my balls in a car door getting out to come to the dollhouse.

95
00:08:14,339 --> 00:08:20,899
Anyways, Kit Boga is going to be there.

96
00:08:20,899 --> 00:08:22,899
Ludwig is going to be there.

97
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:25,899
We also, I can say today, I can say this today too.

98
00:08:25,899 --> 00:08:28,339
I want to make sure that you guys are aware of this.

99
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:33,340
We have a sponsor that is now going to be completely baked into the stream.

100
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:38,340
And it's really good because it can help pay for a shitload of stuff that's really expensive.

101
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:44,960
So not only Twitch, but Coinbase is also going to be helping pay for the stream.

102
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,960
They're going to be presenting the stream as well.

103
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,960
So now we got all the money we need.

104
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,139
And that's probably really, really, really loud.

105
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:55,139
But now we got literally all the money we need.

106
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:59,139
I can't fucking wait to do this show.

107
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:05,659
You're a stock user?

108
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:08,149
Bitcoin Andy.

109
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:15,149
Those of you that have followed this stream for a fairly long time, though, will know that I have been into cryptocurrency since like 2015.

110
00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:21,460
So you've heard me talk about, I mean, we literally have a fucking crypto fake bald coin emote.

111
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:30,779
So it's cool that they wanted to actually come in and help sponsor the stream because we needed it for sure.

112
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:40,299
And at this stage, I wish I could just yell all these insane things that you're going to see in the next like four or five days,

113
00:09:40,299 --> 00:09:44,250
but I can't. I can't do that.

114
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,250
I want to make this really clear again, too.

115
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:52,190
All of the money that's coming in from Twitch, all the money that's coming in from potentially Coinbase,

116
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:57,879
anything that's coming in, I'm not taking any money from.

117
00:09:57,879 --> 00:10:04,879
It's only to make sure that we can pay for the stream and all the production staff, all the people, everybody that's coming together to do this.

118
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:08,309
I can't take any money. It would be impossible.

119
00:10:08,309 --> 00:10:12,549
If I took any money from this stream, the stream wouldn't happen.

120
00:10:12,549 --> 00:10:13,549
It just would be impossible.

121
00:10:13,549 --> 00:10:18,549
So I want to make that really clear that this isn't like, yeah, Coinbase is coming in.

122
00:10:18,549 --> 00:10:21,549
I'm getting a fucking bunch of money for doing it.

123
00:10:21,549 --> 00:10:23,980
So no, that's that's not happening.

124
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:34,399
It's just to I'm fucking grateful, actually, because for them to kind of come in here and give us the remaining kind of funding that that we need is a huge fucking deal.

125
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,789
So this microphone is fucking freaking me out.

126
00:10:38,789 --> 00:10:43,100
But I want to reiterate a couple of things about the extension.

127
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,100
We'll talk about that really briefly.

128
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,659
Am I in jail?

129
00:10:46,659 --> 00:10:51,250
No, I'm wearing a Red Sox shirt.

130
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,870
I'm not like in a prison outfit.

131
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:57,139
Zoom call.

132
00:10:57,139 --> 00:10:59,139
I know this looks like I'm like a fucking professor.

133
00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:05,600
Oh, that was a that was a really weird face.

134
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,860
I'm annoyed that it was an HD prison break.

135
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,360
Yeah, I didn't do shit.

136
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,360
Let me out.

137
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,620
You're in the courthouse.

138
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:22,129
All Boston prisons have Red Sox jumpsuits.

139
00:11:22,129 --> 00:11:25,690
Yeah, they let us all watch the games on TV.

140
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:31,129
Convicted Andy.

141
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:39,750
Well, it's a further back away.

142
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,750
I go the worst it is.

143
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,750
Let's see.

144
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:46,230
Yeah, I'll just give you like a couple of clips just for fun.

145
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:56,820
Ready?

146
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,820
Like, I didn't fucking do anything.

147
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:01,779
I didn't I didn't do anything.

148
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:13,710
Yep.

149
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:16,710
No, I'm not going to give you like no, we're not doing that anymore.

150
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:19,210
Mini green screen.

151
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:21,830
No, I don't want people to fuck with that.

152
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:22,830
Never mind.

153
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:23,830
We're not doing that anymore.

154
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:26,460
Life sentence Larry.

155
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:29,299
I can see your pores.

156
00:12:29,299 --> 00:12:31,299
Don't don't look at me.

157
00:12:31,299 --> 00:12:33,299
This is why I never stream with the camera.

158
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:37,299
This is good because like people can like see my fucking like my nose goes this way.

159
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:39,299
Like one of my eyes has a like red line in it.

160
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:41,299
And my hair is like I'm getting a little gray up here.

161
00:12:41,299 --> 00:12:42,299
I don't want people to know this shit.

162
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:44,299
I'm 25 to a half of you.

163
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:48,299
I can't be like pushing 40 to add to you guys.

164
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:55,299
I have to be able to keep up the appearance of being of I have to keep up the appearance of being a 25 year old.

165
00:12:55,299 --> 00:12:58,299
I have to pick up the appearance being a 25 year old boy.

166
00:12:58,299 --> 00:13:07,559
It's a school assembly.

167
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:11,559
What a weird school assembly this would be if this is what the person was doing.

168
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:13,740
You kids don't understand as the principal.

169
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,740
I have to keep up appearances.

170
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,740
I have to be a 26 year old.

171
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,740
Are you guys don't you understand?

172
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:24,279
I know I can't be old to you pushing 40.

173
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:25,279
Yeah, I know.

174
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:30,080
Your face has too many colors.

175
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,919
No, it doesn't.

176
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:41,259
I mean, if you have a few extra nose hairs, but I don't think that's out of the ordinary.

177
00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:47,169
What are you saying?

178
00:13:47,169 --> 00:13:48,169
You're not 20.

179
00:13:48,169 --> 00:13:51,370
No, your head is huge.

180
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,370
My head is tiny.

181
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:53,370
OK.

182
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,370
Here's a bit more perspective.

183
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:57,669
My I don't have my head is small.

184
00:13:57,669 --> 00:13:59,669
It's because I was leaning in.

185
00:13:59,669 --> 00:14:00,669
Do you know perspectives?

186
00:14:00,669 --> 00:14:03,129
Come on, man.

187
00:14:03,129 --> 00:14:04,129
OK.

188
00:14:04,129 --> 00:14:15,580
Take your mug shot.

189
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:23,360
I just imagine people editing that and being like, dude, I found his fucking arrest records.

190
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,649
He's wearing the same shirt he was wearing when he streamed that time.

191
00:14:28,649 --> 00:14:29,649
Do a side profile.

192
00:14:29,649 --> 00:14:30,649
OK.

193
00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:31,649
No.

194
00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:32,649
What the fuck is the stream?

195
00:14:32,649 --> 00:14:33,649
I don't want to do.

196
00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:35,649
We're supposed to be talking about the dollhouse.

197
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:39,139
I don't want to give you guys like fucking every avenue.

198
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:41,139
Look what I've done to myself.

199
00:14:41,139 --> 00:14:43,139
I gave myself like fucking a rash.

200
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:45,139
I just gave myself a rash on camera.

201
00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:46,139
OK.

202
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:52,139
So the dollhouse is coming up on the 18th, the 20th and 20th.

203
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:53,139
It's three streams.

204
00:14:53,139 --> 00:14:54,139
Not just one.

205
00:14:54,139 --> 00:14:55,139
We're doing three streams.

206
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:57,600
Yes.

207
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,600
I'm going to throw up.

208
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,629
Why?

209
00:15:01,629 --> 00:15:03,629
The extension is going to be baked into Twitch.

210
00:15:03,629 --> 00:15:05,629
A lot of people have been asking this question.

211
00:15:05,629 --> 00:15:08,629
I want to make sure this is very much taken care of.

212
00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:10,940
You're in a porn mansion.

213
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:11,940
Just listen for a second.

214
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,940
We can get back to that in a second.

215
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,940
So the extension is baked.

216
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,940
It's actually a Twitch extension.

217
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,940
There's not going to be anything in the chat room.

218
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,940
So you're not going to be chatting and doing commands or anything.

219
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:23,940
No.

220
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:27,940
It's an extension, an elaborate extension that's baked in through Twitch.

221
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,940
So people were sick.

222
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,940
Do you want me to put something back here so people stop freaking out?

223
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:33,940
Like, hold on.

224
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,940
Should I have a picture of like a painting or something?

225
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:41,190
I don't know.

226
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,190
So we can't see chat.

227
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,190
No.

228
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,190
Chat will be available.

229
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,190
You can chat in the chat room.

230
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:49,190
It's just none of the actions or anything will be in the chat.

231
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:52,190
You'll be actually physically clicking on the screen on an extension

232
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,190
that is baked in through Twitch.

233
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:56,620
You need a louder mic?

234
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:00,250
I thought people told me to lower it because it was so annoying.

235
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,250
How's that?

236
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,740
All right.

237
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:05,690
Is that better?

238
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:07,690
I think it's going to work.

239
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:11,690
I believe a portion of the extension does work on mobile.

240
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:13,690
I think mobile does work.

241
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:18,250
So I don't know if every single feature is going to work on mobile,

242
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,250
but I think I probably would have to get that corrected,

243
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:25,490
but I believe mobile works for at least some of it.

244
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:29,289
The mic sucks.

245
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:30,289
I know.

246
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:31,289
There's nothing I can do about it.

247
00:16:31,289 --> 00:16:34,830
Are you...

248
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:35,830
What are you...

249
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:36,830
Is this supposed to...

250
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:37,830
Oh, also really important.

251
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,830
I want to make sure people are very clear on what you are going to be able to do

252
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:41,830
on this stream.

253
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:45,830
I've seen comments like, oh, so we can make them just like sit and zerk off

254
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,830
for like fucking two hours.

255
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:48,830
That's...

256
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:49,830
That's not...

257
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:50,830
No.

258
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:51,830
Why...

259
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:53,070
No.

260
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,070
This is a game.

261
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:58,070
This is a game where you have to play by the rules of the game, essentially, right?

262
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:01,070
You guys are going to have a lot of things to be able to do,

263
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:05,309
as if you were playing some kind of like type of simulation type games, right?

264
00:17:05,309 --> 00:17:10,309
This is not a scenario where somebody just like tells me to go like zerk off

265
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:12,309
into the fridge for an hour.

266
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:16,309
So that's not how this is going to work.

267
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:20,680
You'll have a lot of shit to do, but that's not one of them.

268
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,680
I heard people say like, oh, can we...

269
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,920
Oh, okay.

270
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:28,920
So ladies and gentlemen, it has just been confirmed by Community Jake.

271
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:33,799
All features work on mobile.

272
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:35,799
Somebody was like coming in here.

273
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:39,059
I was like, shit, what happened?

274
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:44,309
So all features do work on mobile.

275
00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:46,309
No pants?

276
00:17:46,309 --> 00:17:50,180
Right.

277
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,180
Somebody just asked something.

278
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:54,589
What was it?

279
00:17:54,589 --> 00:17:55,589
You're on record calling...

280
00:17:55,589 --> 00:17:59,589
No, I'm not going to be on record in front of like with this like court mic.

281
00:17:59,589 --> 00:18:00,589
What do you got?

282
00:18:00,589 --> 00:18:02,599
You said you wanted something on the mic.

283
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:03,599
What is that?

284
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:11,750
It's just a...

285
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,930
That looks worse.

286
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:13,930
That looks way worse.

287
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:14,930
It's not...

288
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:15,930
That looks like...

289
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:20,920
That looks like I'm streaming from like the bottom of a dumpster.

290
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,920
There's this trash all down here.

291
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,059
And like that's like stuck on the lid.

292
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:33,619
Didn't Oscar the Grouch have like a fucking entire like civilization of the trash can, right?

293
00:18:33,619 --> 00:18:35,789
You need more garbage back there.

294
00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:38,930
Do a dumpster stream.

295
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:40,680
Okay.

296
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,680
Let's...

297
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,680
One thing at a time, please.

298
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,680
One thing at a time.

299
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:50,859
Because this stream that you're going to see in the next week, right?

300
00:18:50,859 --> 00:18:56,539
We were just in chat and somebody was like, oh, hey, man, like, this would be cool.

301
00:18:56,539 --> 00:18:58,539
And like, yeah, it would be cool, wouldn't it?

302
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:02,539
Oh, imagine if I like if I was in a dollhouse and you guys like controlled what I was doing

303
00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:06,539
and we did like a real life like life simulator.

304
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:08,359
Ha ha ha.

305
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:10,109
Oh dear.

306
00:19:10,109 --> 00:19:11,109
Oh dear.

307
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:12,109
Literally.

308
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:15,539
Big, big shit later and here we are.

309
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:17,539
So can we do one at a time?

310
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:20,539
Like I don't want to go now like contact a bunch of people and be like, okay, I'm going

311
00:19:20,539 --> 00:19:24,539
to do a dumpster stream and it's going to cost this amount of money and I need to have

312
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,539
like a fucking whole civilization in the dumpster.

313
00:19:26,539 --> 00:19:30,579
Like, you know, one thing at a time.

314
00:19:30,579 --> 00:19:31,579
Are there any breaks?

315
00:19:31,579 --> 00:19:33,259
Yeah.

316
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:35,259
So you guys are going to be able to buy stuff.

317
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:36,259
I want to make that clear too.

318
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:39,259
So people think, oh, we're just going to make you like be able to like take a shit like

319
00:19:39,259 --> 00:19:40,259
a thousand times.

320
00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:43,569
You are going to have a buy menu.

321
00:19:43,569 --> 00:19:44,569
Yes.

322
00:19:44,569 --> 00:19:48,569
With lots and lots and lots of options.

323
00:19:48,569 --> 00:19:49,569
You will have money.

324
00:19:49,569 --> 00:19:54,579
You're going to have a currency to have to deal with there.

325
00:19:54,579 --> 00:19:59,579
This is not just me walking around a room without any interaction from you guys or just

326
00:19:59,579 --> 00:20:01,579
simply telling me where to go.

327
00:20:01,579 --> 00:20:05,750
You're going to be able to put furniture wherever the fuck you want.

328
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,750
It's baked into the extension.

329
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:12,740
So it's, it's not, it's not, it's not real money.

330
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:17,339
Will there be gambling?

331
00:20:17,339 --> 00:20:19,829
I don't, I don't know.

332
00:20:19,829 --> 00:20:20,829
I don't think so.

333
00:20:20,829 --> 00:20:25,019
Not off the top of my head.

334
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:27,019
It's going to be bonkers.

335
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:31,859
I can at least say it'll be, it'll be interesting to watch.

336
00:20:31,859 --> 00:20:32,859
Buy a slot machine.

337
00:20:32,859 --> 00:20:34,859
I wonder, I wonder if there's anything.

338
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:35,859
I don't know.

339
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:37,740
We'll see.

340
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,740
Is it channel points?

341
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,740
No.

342
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,740
It is its own currency in the extension baked into the game.

343
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,700
Not channel points.

344
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:49,740
Is it going to be a shit pants button?

345
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:53,109
You guys are going to have to take care of me.

346
00:20:53,109 --> 00:20:54,109
Let me make that clear as well.

347
00:20:54,109 --> 00:20:58,309
You're going to have things that you're going to have to manage.

348
00:20:58,309 --> 00:21:01,309
It's not just me walking around and like pooping.

349
00:21:01,309 --> 00:21:05,180
I have quite a few needs that you're going to have to attend to.

350
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:09,230
Can you cook?

351
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:11,430
Yes.

352
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:14,819
I don't want to give too much shit away.

353
00:21:14,819 --> 00:21:15,819
I really don't.

354
00:21:15,819 --> 00:21:23,250
But yes, you're going to be able to do things.

355
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,900
He's a maniac.

356
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,539
Debatable.

357
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:29,539
Is there a mana bar?

358
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:31,539
No, but there's something.

359
00:21:31,539 --> 00:21:36,779
There are things that need to be managed that could be potentially bar related.

360
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:44,940
How many things will be baked?

361
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,880
I don't know.

362
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:53,980
That's not like a fire alarm.

363
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:59,190
Can you guys hear that?

364
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:03,779
Yeah, just leave it over there for now.

365
00:22:03,779 --> 00:22:08,680
There's a fucking lift over here.

366
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:13,160
I told you I'm in the dumpster.

367
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:22,559
There may or may not be a lift for some reason over here.

368
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:23,559
I don't know.

369
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:26,400
Do a recap.

370
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,640
Okay.

371
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,880
Quick recap.

372
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,880
Extension works on mobile.

373
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,880
It works on desktop.

374
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,880
You don't have to be nothing special.

375
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,880
You just have to be on Twitch.

376
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,869
Kitboga's going to be there.

377
00:22:37,869 --> 00:22:38,869
Ludwig's going to be there.

378
00:22:38,869 --> 00:22:45,099
There may even be a few others that you may or may not know.

379
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:50,880
How do we control you?

380
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,880
Through the extension.

381
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:55,380
The extension is going to have a menu.

382
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:59,380
We're doing this for three days, so this is something important to remember, too.

383
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:03,940
The first stream that we're doing on, I believe it's Wednesday the 18th, right?

384
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:04,940
Yeah.

385
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:08,299
The first stream is a tutorial.

386
00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:09,299
It really is.

387
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:13,480
Because I want to make sure that everything works, that people know how the thing, how

388
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,480
the extension works, how well did it work, does anything need to be changed, tweaked.

389
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,480
The first stream is a tutorial.

390
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,480
I'm just going to say it because that's the way it is.

391
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,779
What are you saying?

392
00:23:22,779 --> 00:23:27,700
Am I saying Joe Biden?

393
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,599
No.

394
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:31,599
No.

395
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:33,859
No, Joe.

396
00:23:33,859 --> 00:23:34,859
No.

397
00:23:34,859 --> 00:23:36,170
He's not here.

398
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:38,369
I was like, why are they saying that?

399
00:23:38,369 --> 00:23:40,369
It doesn't make any sense.

400
00:23:40,369 --> 00:23:47,970
But anyways, the first stream is a tutorial for everyone to learn how the extension works.

401
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:51,970
That doesn't mean it's not going to be a fun experiment, a fun stream.

402
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:53,970
It's just that's why we did three of them.

403
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:59,140
Because we want you guys to have the ability to kind of learn how it works and keep going.

404
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:01,140
Because one stream is just not going to do it.

405
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:07,069
If we did one stream or even two streams, by the time you guys figured out even how it worked,

406
00:24:07,069 --> 00:24:08,069
it's like, oh, that's it.

407
00:24:08,069 --> 00:24:09,069
See you later.

408
00:24:09,069 --> 00:24:14,809
No, we wanted time for you guys to play around and have fun.

409
00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:16,809
So there will be plenty of instructions.

410
00:24:16,809 --> 00:24:19,809
There will be plenty of ways for you guys to figure out what's going on.

411
00:24:19,809 --> 00:24:21,809
And we'll be doing it for three days.

412
00:24:21,809 --> 00:24:27,099
How many hours?

413
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:28,789
That's a really good question.

414
00:24:28,789 --> 00:24:31,539
It really depends on a few factors.

415
00:24:31,539 --> 00:24:41,619
But it will be at least, each stream will be probably at least, the first stream is a tutorial.

416
00:24:41,619 --> 00:24:45,619
Because remember, it's the 18th, the 20th, and 21st.

417
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:52,930
So that day, that first stream is probably going to be pretty short just to make sure things go off.

418
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:54,930
People know what they're doing.

419
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:55,930
The tutorial goes well.

420
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,930
We do some fun stuff.

421
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:01,930
And then we have a day to get other stuff prepared and make sure we can get it all ready.

422
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:06,920
And then day two and three are like, here we go.

423
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,920
And I would assume it's probably going to be at least three to six hours a day.

424
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,920
At least.

425
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,920
Probably four to six hours each stream.

426
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:18,309
So it's not going to be a two-hour stream for each one.

427
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:20,309
There will be at least four, five, six hours each.

428
00:25:20,309 --> 00:25:26,289
What else is he saying here?

429
00:25:26,289 --> 00:25:28,359
Is it a tutorial?

430
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:29,599
Yeah.

431
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:31,599
It's a very elaborate extension.

432
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:35,099
So it's, like I said, it's not just simply writing.

433
00:25:35,099 --> 00:25:40,099
Because remember, the carnival stream had people just kind of doing inputs into the stream.

434
00:25:40,099 --> 00:25:45,099
You know, like up, down, fire, up, down, left, right, like forward, forward, back, back, back, right?

435
00:25:45,099 --> 00:25:51,400
This is multiple menus, multiple things to click on, multiple things to look at.

436
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,579
So you're going to need the time to figure out how to use it.

437
00:25:54,579 --> 00:25:56,839
Ken, is it?

438
00:25:56,839 --> 00:25:57,839
No.

439
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:01,940
What are you saying?

440
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:02,940
Snob Andy?

441
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,079
What?

442
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:06,079
Snob Andy?

443
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:10,519
Why did you call me Snob Andy?

444
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:12,660
Is that what you said?

445
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,660
I didn't even see it.

446
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:16,789
How many NPCs were there be?

447
00:26:16,789 --> 00:26:28,420
Do I need to just confirm that there are NPCs?

448
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,869
I don't know.

449
00:26:30,869 --> 00:26:31,869
I don't know.

450
00:26:31,869 --> 00:26:32,869
It could be fucking...

451
00:26:32,869 --> 00:26:33,869
You'll see.

452
00:26:33,869 --> 00:26:37,460
It'll be enough.

453
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,460
Fuck it.

454
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,460
I don't know.

455
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:42,940
Fuck around and find out.

456
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:43,940
Wake me up when he plays Sly Cooper.

457
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:57,210
And I'm here to announce, ladies and gentlemen, that after the Dollhouse streams, I will...

458
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:59,210
I'm not playing Sly Cooper.

459
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:00,210
I tried to play it.

460
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:03,509
It ran like shit and I couldn't get it to work.

461
00:27:03,509 --> 00:27:05,509
But I'll play it on the remastered ones.

462
00:27:05,509 --> 00:27:08,509
Why am I even fucking responding to this person?

463
00:27:08,509 --> 00:27:10,509
Why am I responding to this?

464
00:27:10,509 --> 00:27:12,509
This has nothing to do with the stream.

465
00:27:12,509 --> 00:27:14,509
Let me tell you when I'm going to play Sly Cooper.

466
00:27:14,509 --> 00:27:17,460
Why am I even responding?

467
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,460
That person just wrote...

468
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:21,460
Why did I even reply to that person?

469
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:24,720
What am I doing?

470
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,960
It was like...

471
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,960
I don't know.

472
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,960
Small words work on me.

473
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,390
Like, sly.

474
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:32,390
That's easy.

475
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,390
That's an easy word.

476
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:34,390
I know that.

477
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:35,390
One, two, three.

478
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:36,390
Small words.

479
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:39,230
I see them.

480
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:40,230
And I go, okay.

481
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:43,650
What's this stream about anyways?

482
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:49,579
In offline chat four and a half years ago, we made a couple of offhand comments about

483
00:27:49,579 --> 00:27:53,250
being in a simulator.

484
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:56,250
And like, what if I was in a dollhouse and you guys could control me and funny things

485
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,250
happened, in quotes.

486
00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:00,319
And I was like, oh, that sounds like a pretty funny idea.

487
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:02,319
And then four years later, we decided to do it.

488
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:04,900
Aaron.

489
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:05,900
Fuck.

490
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:10,150
God.

491
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:11,150
Oh, my pinky.

492
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:16,460
Why don't you use that for the court session?

493
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:19,829
Uh, Mr. Albertson, are you aware of the charges?

494
00:28:19,829 --> 00:28:23,890
I fucking lock him up.

495
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:25,890
Like, I guess he did it.

496
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:30,460
Comic Con panel.

497
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,460
All right.

498
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,460
Yeah.

499
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:37,539
I'll do Comic Con.

500
00:28:37,539 --> 00:28:40,759
Why do they all sit like this?

501
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:42,059
What's up?

502
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:43,059
Hey, hey.

503
00:28:43,059 --> 00:28:45,200
What's going on?

504
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,200
Is there a reason?

505
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,200
Does this make you look more relatable or something?

506
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:52,509
It's always like, yeah, that was a pretty sick project that we did.

507
00:28:52,509 --> 00:28:53,509
We worked on it.

508
00:28:53,509 --> 00:28:54,509
It was pretty cool.

509
00:28:54,509 --> 00:28:56,690
Yeah, I got a couple of funny fucking stories for you.

510
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:58,690
It's like, what's this doing up here?

511
00:28:58,690 --> 00:28:59,690
Why is this up here?

512
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:01,690
Put it down here and sit like this.

513
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:04,759
I don't get it.

514
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:09,069
That's not relatable.

515
00:29:09,069 --> 00:29:12,269
It's because they're waiting to leave.

516
00:29:13,269 --> 00:29:16,619
Well, let me put these on.

517
00:29:16,619 --> 00:29:18,799
No, I'm not going to play around with any toys over here.

518
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:19,799
This is not toys.

519
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:23,319
What's the bag behind you?

520
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:26,819
It's part of a dollhouse.

521
00:29:26,819 --> 00:29:27,819
Arg.

522
00:29:27,819 --> 00:29:35,019
Community Jake just put it back here.

523
00:29:35,019 --> 00:29:36,019
There's no arg.

524
00:29:36,019 --> 00:29:37,019
I just want to make that clear.

525
00:29:37,019 --> 00:29:39,099
Eat the mic.

526
00:29:39,099 --> 00:29:40,099
No.

527
00:29:40,099 --> 00:29:45,730
Do you have any pets that we can pet for there?

528
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:46,730
There are no pets.

529
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:48,099
There are no pets.

530
00:29:48,099 --> 00:29:51,170
I want to make that clear.

531
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:55,609
He's unaware.

532
00:29:55,609 --> 00:29:59,829
There's no auto DLC.

533
00:29:59,829 --> 00:30:01,829
No, unfortunately, no auto DLC.

534
00:30:01,829 --> 00:30:04,670
He doesn't know.

535
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:05,670
Don't say anything.

536
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,740
Is someone in my face?

537
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,740
Someone in my nose?

538
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:09,740
What's wrong with me?

539
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:10,740
What?

540
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:18,180
What the heck was wrong?

541
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:21,990
I'm going to burp and I can't turn the camera off because I don't know how.

542
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:23,990
I don't know what this is.

543
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:24,990
This is not my usual setup.

544
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,990
I'm going to have to lean back for a second.

545
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:27,990
Don't tell him.

546
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:38,380
Well, whatever.

547
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:41,380
I'm sure I'll read it on fucking Reddit tomorrow.

548
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:44,009
He had boogers all over his hair.

549
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:45,009
Oh, whatever.

550
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,009
What are the times again?

551
00:30:46,009 --> 00:30:50,039
Okay, let's make that clear as well.

552
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,039
I just got stuck up here.

553
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:55,039
Did you see that?

554
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:59,039
So I'm going to say, no, this is in August.

555
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:04,039
So Wednesday the 18th, we're starting at 12 p.m. Pacific.

556
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:12,670
And then Friday the 20th, we are starting at 12 p.m. Pacific.

557
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:20,279
And then Saturday, we're starting at 9 a.m. Pacific because we want to be able to have

558
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:21,279
as much time as we can.

559
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,279
So 12, 12, 9 Pacific.

560
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:27,539
You have a wig on?

561
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:28,539
Rip it off.

562
00:31:28,539 --> 00:31:36,849
Okay, I have a question for you.

563
00:31:36,849 --> 00:31:40,789
What would you guys say is my good side?

564
00:31:40,789 --> 00:31:45,059
This one or this one?

565
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:52,700
What's my good side?

566
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:58,480
I would say this is the bad side because my nose goes like that way.

567
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,410
Front-facing?

568
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:03,410
This side?

569
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:06,059
This side.

570
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:10,109
Who cares?

571
00:32:10,109 --> 00:32:12,109
Like, really, who gives a shit?

572
00:32:12,109 --> 00:32:13,109
What are we talking about?

573
00:32:13,109 --> 00:32:15,109
You're not talking about it.

574
00:32:15,109 --> 00:32:16,109
It's me talking about it.

575
00:32:16,109 --> 00:32:17,109
I don't know why I am.

576
00:32:17,109 --> 00:32:18,990
I didn't.

577
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:20,490
I missed.

578
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:27,779
I was looking at the preview and I was going to try to pretend to snort the mic and I went

579
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:28,779
the wrong way.

580
00:32:28,779 --> 00:32:35,640
So I just looked like a fucking maniac because that would have been like, oh, he's like

581
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,640
sniffing the mic.

582
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:41,990
But instead, I just went like, is the Minecraft server still being developed?

583
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:45,990
Yes, it's just this was such a big project that everything else had to go on hold.

584
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:50,299
But as of next week, we'll be ready to focus on some more stuff.

585
00:32:50,299 --> 00:32:54,460
How do you eat peanut butter?

586
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:59,460
50% of the time, out of the jar with a spoon with some fluff next to me.

587
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:03,460
So I do one big spoon of peanut butter and then one big spoon of fluff and let it just

588
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,460
mess around in my mouth and swallow it.

589
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:10,460
And then the other half is on like a piece of toast, just like spread it on toast.

590
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:17,359
And if you've never done the first one, then I don't even know how I could even explain

591
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:18,359
that to you.

592
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:20,359
It's unbelievably good.

593
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:21,359
And I'm going to die.

594
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:25,359
Guys, this is not a thing I do every day.

595
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:29,299
I don't eat like a jar of peanut butter every day.

596
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:34,740
Although I have Googled before, do you die if you eat a whole jar of peanut butter?

597
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:35,740
I've Googled that.

598
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:37,740
I actually have Googled that.

599
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,740
And the answer is no.

600
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:41,740
But be careful.

601
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:44,740
So yeah, I love peanut butter, though.

602
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,740
I think it's awesome.

603
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:49,799
Cholesterol.

604
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:51,799
Now, you don't eat a whole jar of anything.

605
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:57,980
The Google result should be, Google, what happens if you eat a whole jar of pickles?

606
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:58,980
I don't know, but don't do it.

607
00:33:58,980 --> 00:33:59,980
Just eat like four.

608
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:03,559
Google, what happens if you eat a whole jar of peanut butter?

609
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:04,559
I don't know.

610
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:05,559
Probably nothing good.

611
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:06,559
Don't do it.

612
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:07,559
Just have like three or four servings.

613
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:09,309
Have like a serving.

614
00:34:09,309 --> 00:34:11,309
You could say that for anything.

615
00:34:11,309 --> 00:34:12,309
Literally any food product.

616
00:34:12,309 --> 00:34:13,309
Just don't eat the whole thing.

617
00:34:13,309 --> 00:34:14,309
Eat like one or two servings.

618
00:34:14,309 --> 00:34:15,309
That's it.

619
00:34:15,309 --> 00:34:18,409
Do I like cantaloupe?

620
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:20,159
No.

621
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,159
Sorry.

622
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:23,940
A whole, what about moderation?

623
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:24,940
Yeah.

624
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:25,940
Just do moderation.

625
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,690
Moderate.

626
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,690
Do you like bananas?

627
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:29,989
Yes.

628
00:34:29,989 --> 00:34:30,989
AMA stream.

629
00:34:30,989 --> 00:34:31,989
Yeah.

630
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:33,300
That's what this is.

631
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:37,559
Do you have more than one food product in your house?

632
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:38,929
Yeah.

633
00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:40,940
Of course I do.

634
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:41,940
What do you think I am, dumb?

635
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:48,039
Can you guys ask dollhouse related questions?

636
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:52,039
Like what my favorite peanut butter brand is is not relevant to the dollhouse stream.

637
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:56,010
What happens if we take good care of you?

638
00:34:56,010 --> 00:35:00,010
Well, then I will have probably be a more happy existence.

639
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:05,139
I mean, I'm going to have to make money somehow, right?

640
00:35:05,139 --> 00:35:09,139
I'm going to have to make sure that I'm taken care of so I can perform, right?

641
00:35:09,139 --> 00:35:17,869
What's my favorite Sonic character?

642
00:35:17,869 --> 00:35:23,760
That's a really hard question.

643
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,760
Who's my favorite Sonic character?

644
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:34,079
I don't want to say Tails.

645
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,320
That's easy, right?

646
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:42,530
Robotnik is easy too.

647
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:50,630
Can I just say Jim Carrey?

648
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:52,809
That's my answer.

649
00:35:52,809 --> 00:35:57,579
When you speak in, no, it's going to be in English.

650
00:35:57,579 --> 00:36:04,579
So not going to be doing any other dialect or any language that's not English.

651
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:05,579
It's going to be in English.

652
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:12,579
We fought for a long time about if I should talk in like kind of non-existent language,

653
00:36:12,579 --> 00:36:22,579
but that turned out to be something that I did not want to do for like more than 12 to 18 fucking hours.

654
00:36:22,579 --> 00:36:23,579
You know what I mean?

655
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:27,579
Like if each one of these streams is like four, five, six hours long,

656
00:36:27,579 --> 00:36:34,579
I'm not, I don't want to talk in like fake, not just a fake language for that long.

657
00:36:34,579 --> 00:36:35,579
It would be unbearable.

658
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:41,219
So no.

659
00:36:41,219 --> 00:36:45,949
What was he saying?

660
00:36:45,949 --> 00:36:50,429
Are you going to do a funny accent?

661
00:36:50,429 --> 00:36:53,909
Probably not.

662
00:36:53,909 --> 00:36:55,909
It's just me.

663
00:36:55,909 --> 00:37:02,460
I'm not going to answer specific questions about specific things that you want to see there,

664
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,460
or if certain objects are there, you're just going to have to see.

665
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,460
You're just going to have to play the game.

666
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:13,329
Hold on.

667
00:37:13,329 --> 00:37:14,329
Somebody had like an interesting question.

668
00:37:14,329 --> 00:37:15,329
What was it?

669
00:37:15,329 --> 00:37:16,699
What did you say?

670
00:37:16,699 --> 00:37:20,699
Do we get to do a character customizer?

671
00:37:20,699 --> 00:37:32,929
I just keep touching my fucking mouth.

672
00:37:32,929 --> 00:37:35,360
Is there a character customizer?

673
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:40,610
I really am at like a court session.

674
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:44,170
I'm not going to answer that question, Your Honor.

675
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:46,369
Okay.

676
00:37:46,369 --> 00:37:47,369
All right.

677
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:48,369
So that means you did it.

678
00:37:48,369 --> 00:37:50,369
I'm just not going to answer that question.

679
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:52,369
I don't think I need to answer that question.

680
00:37:52,369 --> 00:37:55,369
If there will or will not be character customization.

681
00:37:55,369 --> 00:37:57,369
I don't think I have to answer that, Your Honor.

682
00:37:57,369 --> 00:37:59,369
I keep fucking touching this thing with my mouth.

683
00:37:59,369 --> 00:38:06,789
The stream is so fucking vague.

684
00:38:06,789 --> 00:38:10,789
It kind of has to be though, because there's a lot of surprises.

685
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:13,789
There's a lot of things that I think people don't know are going to happen.

686
00:38:13,789 --> 00:38:17,789
And I'd rather not just sit here three or four days before the stream

687
00:38:17,789 --> 00:38:21,789
and just tell you all the fun potential things you can do.

688
00:38:21,789 --> 00:38:23,789
I'd rather you figure that out on your own.

689
00:38:23,789 --> 00:38:29,739
Yes, there's a fucking, yes, there's a character creator.

690
00:38:29,739 --> 00:38:30,739
Okay.

691
00:38:30,739 --> 00:38:31,739
There you go.

692
00:38:31,739 --> 00:38:32,739
Yes.

693
00:38:32,739 --> 00:38:35,010
Yes, there is a character creator.

694
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,010
Yes.

695
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:37,010
That's all you're getting.

696
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:39,380
That is literally the only thing you're getting.

697
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:52,219
Can we adjust your height?

698
00:38:52,219 --> 00:38:57,619
And I specifically made sure that that was something we weren't going to do.

699
00:38:57,619 --> 00:38:59,619
What are the dates and times of the streams?

700
00:38:59,619 --> 00:39:03,619
18th, the 18th, the 20th, and the 21st.

701
00:39:03,619 --> 00:39:07,619
The 18th and the 20th, the streams will be at 12 p.m. Pacific.

702
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:11,619
The 21st stream will be at 9 a.m. Pacific.

703
00:39:11,619 --> 00:39:17,619
Each stream is scheduled to go for approximately three to six hours,

704
00:39:17,619 --> 00:39:23,940
depending on chat interaction and scenario play-outs.

705
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:24,940
How's your body feeling?

706
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,699
I'm feeling okay.

707
00:39:26,699 --> 00:39:29,699
I'm still dealing with it.

708
00:39:29,699 --> 00:39:35,380
I'm powering through a handful of problems right now.

709
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:41,070
I don't know what Greek god I angered in the last two or three weeks,

710
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:44,070
but a few things have just piled on here.

711
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:47,070
The last 48 hours, too.

712
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:51,139
I'm powering through as hard as I can,

713
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:56,139
and I'm on some medication to help with stuff that's happening,

714
00:39:56,139 --> 00:39:58,139
and I should be good to go.

715
00:39:58,139 --> 00:40:01,380
This stream is so interesting to me.

716
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:03,380
There's tons of people involved.

717
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:06,940
Tons of awesome people have worked on this,

718
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:09,940
and maybe eventually we'll do something.

719
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,940
Maybe after the stream is over,

720
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:14,940
we'll probably get people together to talk about it,

721
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:18,940
because it's not just me that had anything to do with this.

722
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,940
Yes, I was like, this is what I want,

723
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:21,940
this is what I think would be funny,

724
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,940
and this is what I think would be fun.

725
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:28,250
But it took a monumental amount of people

726
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:31,250
and a monumental amount of financial support

727
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:34,250
from different organizations.

728
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:37,250
I couldn't be happier with how this is turning out.

729
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:39,250
I really hope it's a lot of fun for everybody.

730
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:41,250
I'm really excited.

731
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:45,250
I hope it's as interesting and as fun as I hope it is.

732
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:46,250
And if it is, great.

733
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:49,250
If it isn't, then we tried to do something interesting, right?

734
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:52,250
But I can't see a scenario where this is not at least worth

735
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:55,679
at least watching for a little while.

736
00:40:55,679 --> 00:41:00,670
Yeah, I've seen a lot of things the last few days

737
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:03,170
that I'm just so...

738
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:06,170
I'm very proud and very grateful for the people

739
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:08,170
that have been working on this project.

740
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:11,170
It's fucking unbelievable.

741
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:13,469
So I can't wait for you to see it.

742
00:41:13,469 --> 00:41:14,469
I really can't.

743
00:41:14,469 --> 00:41:18,440
He's going to cry.

744
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:23,070
Show your feet.

745
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:27,210
Okay, let's show our bare feet.

746
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:31,179
What are you doing here?

747
00:41:31,179 --> 00:41:32,480
What?

748
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:39,480
Okay, worst phase 2021.

749
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:47,610
Who else is in the room?

750
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:55,179
Your honor.

751
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,179
What's happening?

752
00:41:56,179 --> 00:41:57,739
Booger.

753
00:41:57,739 --> 00:41:58,739
Is the echo...

754
00:41:58,739 --> 00:42:04,949
I'm just in a big room, a big empty room.

755
00:42:04,949 --> 00:42:05,949
Blink if you're in trouble.

756
00:42:05,949 --> 00:42:08,949
I have to blink normally as a human.

757
00:42:08,949 --> 00:42:09,949
I'm fine.

758
00:42:09,949 --> 00:42:10,949
Nothing's wrong.

759
00:42:10,949 --> 00:42:13,949
I'm blinking now because I'm literally a human that blinks.

760
00:42:13,949 --> 00:42:15,949
That's how we like secrete liquid into our eyelids

761
00:42:15,949 --> 00:42:18,949
to keep our eyes moisturized.

762
00:42:18,949 --> 00:42:21,150
I have to blink.

763
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:22,150
I'm fine.

764
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:24,150
I am fine right now, okay?

765
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:27,150
I'm going to clip these weird images of me with an HD camera

766
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:29,150
and be like, what's wrong with him?

767
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:31,150
You're going to take that, and you're going to get like this,

768
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:33,150
and people are going to be like, is he all right?

769
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,150
What happened to him?

770
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:35,969
I'm fine.

771
00:42:35,969 --> 00:42:44,010
So there's a lot of work still to be done.

772
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:47,500
I wanted to come in and make sure that I talk to you guys

773
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,500
one-on-one before the stream happened

774
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,500
because I wasn't able to the last week,

775
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,500
and I wanted to play The Sims 3,

776
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,500
and I have a shitload of mods on The Sims 3,

777
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:59,500
and that game is an absolute clown show ready to happen.

778
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:02,500
I'll probably do that after the Dollhouse stuff,

779
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:05,190
but I wanted to at least say hello

780
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:07,190
and explain a little more detail on stuff

781
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:09,190
and give you some more insight on it.

782
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:13,889
So I'm glad I was at least able to do this

783
00:43:13,889 --> 00:43:15,889
for the period I have here.

784
00:43:15,889 --> 00:43:17,889
So there's still a lot of shit to be done.

785
00:43:17,889 --> 00:43:19,889
I'm going to get back to it,

786
00:43:19,889 --> 00:43:23,889
and I can't wait for you to see the finished product.

787
00:43:23,889 --> 00:43:26,889
Hopefully it's as interesting as I hope it is.

788
00:43:26,889 --> 00:43:31,340
How much power does one person have?

789
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:35,340
One person has not power over anybody else.

790
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:40,340
It's going to be a system based off of a democracy-type system,

791
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:43,519
and there is...

792
00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:49,329
Why? What?

793
00:43:49,329 --> 00:43:51,329
It's baked in through Twitch.

794
00:43:51,329 --> 00:43:57,730
That's pretty much how it works.

795
00:43:57,730 --> 00:43:59,730
Do we get money for watching the stream?

796
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:02,730
So there's going to be a monetary system

797
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:04,730
that you guys will have to manage,

798
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:08,969
and whether that's sending me to work, right?

799
00:44:08,969 --> 00:44:12,969
Whether that's managing what kind of thing you want to buy.

800
00:44:12,969 --> 00:44:15,400
Where do you want to put it?

801
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,400
You're going to have a lot of things to worry about,

802
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,579
and hopefully you can work together

803
00:44:19,579 --> 00:44:22,460
to have a good outcome.

804
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:26,460
Otherwise, I'm going to be in trouble.

805
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:32,079
Where will you work?

806
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:35,079
These are all things that you will be shown very shortly.

807
00:44:35,079 --> 00:44:40,900
And then microtransactions.

808
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:42,900
The entire game is a microtransaction,

809
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:45,210
if you think about it.

810
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:47,210
You're going to be spending money on all kinds of stuff.

811
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:49,690
So the whole thing is a microtransaction.

812
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:51,860
But you don't have to pay for anything.

813
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:59,099
You just have to watch.

814
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:03,059
Chat's going very fast. Let me see.

815
00:45:03,059 --> 00:45:06,059
Will the extension work on every web navigator?

816
00:45:06,059 --> 00:45:10,059
I believe all through desktop and mobile

817
00:45:10,059 --> 00:45:12,059
it's been confirmed that it will work.

818
00:45:12,059 --> 00:45:22,349
What if we kill you in the tutorial?

819
00:45:22,349 --> 00:45:26,780
I don't want to give you guys any ways

820
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:28,780
to make this any different than it could be.

821
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:31,860
Like, take care of me.

822
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:35,550
Take care of me.

823
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:37,550
I'm a growing boy. I'm pushing for it.

824
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:41,579
But I'm a growing boy still.

825
00:45:41,579 --> 00:45:43,579
How much interaction with the outside world?

826
00:45:43,579 --> 00:45:51,340
I think you mean how much interaction with other people

827
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:53,340
or things that come to the dollhouse?

828
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:56,030
Is that what you mean?

829
00:45:56,030 --> 00:46:00,210
Because with you guys, I will be communicating with you

830
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:04,449
as well as potential NPCs

831
00:46:04,449 --> 00:46:07,619
and people that will arrive or not arrive, right?

832
00:46:07,619 --> 00:46:09,619
So there will be lots of interactions

833
00:46:09,619 --> 00:46:13,340
with other people.

834
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:20,820
Will I go outside?

835
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:24,090
You fucking answered. You're my lawyer.

836
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:26,090
Stop acting like a teen. You're 35, dude.

837
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:28,090
I'm not acting like...

838
00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:30,090
Me getting angry and loud is like a teen.

839
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:32,389
Like, that's not what I'm doing, Mom!

840
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:38,789
I'll be an adult.

841
00:46:38,789 --> 00:46:40,789
How is it going to work with people in the chat?

842
00:46:40,789 --> 00:46:42,789
The chat room is just going to be the chat room.

843
00:46:42,789 --> 00:46:45,159
So you are free to just chat like you normally would.

844
00:46:45,159 --> 00:46:47,159
Everything is going to be baked in through Twitch

845
00:46:47,159 --> 00:46:49,340
as an extension.

846
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:51,340
So the chat's going to be free for you guys just to talk.

847
00:46:51,340 --> 00:47:00,219
Will there be action?

848
00:47:00,219 --> 00:47:05,849
You want to take that one?

849
00:47:05,849 --> 00:47:07,849
How much bacon? I stopped touching this.

850
00:47:07,849 --> 00:47:12,650
How much bacon are you allowed to eat?

851
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:14,650
Is there even a limit of how much bacon you should have?

852
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:22,179
Will there be QuickTime events?

853
00:47:22,179 --> 00:47:25,510
Hey, you want some bacon, lawyer?

854
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:27,510
You want some bacon?

855
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:32,820
How will the camera work?

856
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:38,250
Just wait.

857
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:40,679
Will there be pyrotechnics?

858
00:47:40,679 --> 00:47:42,679
Yeah.

859
00:47:42,679 --> 00:48:03,980
I don't know.

860
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:06,219
You guys can hear the explosions, right?

861
00:48:06,219 --> 00:48:11,590
Fireworks?

862
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:15,030
Good.

863
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:17,030
I am going to go.

864
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:20,280
There's a lot to do.

865
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,280
Will there be ragdoll physics?

866
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:27,460
What the fuck was that?

867
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:30,730
I don't want to tell you guys everything.

868
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:32,730
You're just going to have to watch.

869
00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:38,420
That was such a smug asshole.

870
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:40,420
Oh, is there ragdoll physics?

871
00:48:48,309 --> 00:48:51,829
Can we make you eat a jar of fluff?

872
00:48:51,829 --> 00:48:53,829
Just wait.

873
00:48:53,829 --> 00:48:57,030
Baked in through Twitch.

874
00:48:57,030 --> 00:48:59,030
That's been the motto.

875
00:48:59,030 --> 00:49:01,030
What am I trying to say?

876
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:04,420
The motto of this stream

877
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:06,920
is

878
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:08,920
it's baked in through Twitch.

879
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:11,800
But yeah, we have

880
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:13,800
Coinbase is now a presenting

881
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,800
sponsor on the stream.

882
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,800
We're able to do a lot of stuff.

883
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,800
I am fucking insanely

884
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,800
excited. I'm going to power through

885
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,800
some of these issues that I have

886
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,800
because I think it's going to be really fun.

887
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,800
It's going to be at least fun to do.

888
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,619
The next time you see this stream

889
00:49:30,619 --> 00:49:32,619
live, it will be on the 18th

890
00:49:32,619 --> 00:49:34,619
at 12 p.m. Pacific.

891
00:49:34,619 --> 00:49:36,619
We're going to go for it.

892
00:49:36,619 --> 00:49:38,860
It'll be a tutorial.

893
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:40,860
Hopefully you'll learn how to play it.

894
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:42,860
We'll see how it goes.

895
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:45,989
I'm really, really excited.

896
00:49:45,989 --> 00:49:47,989
I can't wait.

897
00:49:47,989 --> 00:49:49,989
I'm just going to go

898
00:49:49,989 --> 00:49:52,230
and just turn the stream off.

899
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:54,230
Let me make sure this is correct.

900
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:56,230
My brain is...

901
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:59,559
I'm slowing down here.

902
00:49:59,559 --> 00:50:01,559
I will see you guys Wednesday the 18th.

903
00:50:01,559 --> 00:50:03,559
That's only a few days from now.

904
00:50:03,559 --> 00:50:05,559
That's 12 p.m. Pacific.

905
00:50:05,559 --> 00:50:07,559
It's the next time this stream is going to be live.

906
00:50:07,559 --> 00:50:09,559
The extension will be there

907
00:50:09,559 --> 00:50:12,570
and you can learn how to play.

908
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:14,570
See you soon. I'm very excited.

909
00:50:14,570 --> 00:51:04,519
One more for the road, right?

910
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:06,519
Look at this.
