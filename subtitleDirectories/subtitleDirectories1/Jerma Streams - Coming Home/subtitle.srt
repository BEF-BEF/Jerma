1
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:14,470
I told you guys I was gonna be early. I told you. I mean, I'm only five minutes early,

2
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:27,179
but I'm still early. Still counts. Well does. How you doing? Are we doing good?

3
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:42,549
I gotta tweet this. Today, we're gonna play some FMV games. One just came out that piqued my

4
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:54,299
interest. If we're gonna play the first one is not late. No, I'm not late. I'm precisely on

5
00:00:54,299 --> 00:01:06,329
time. The first one is called American Hero and apparently this game is like 25 years old

6
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:16,939
and it was never released. So some company, I guess they like got 90% of the way through

7
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:22,920
development and they just didn't finish the game. So some random indie company, I don't

8
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:29,159
see what the name of the company is. I kind of forget. Got all the footage

9
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:38,379
and actually released it. So this is a very old game. I'm very interested in this one.

10
00:01:38,379 --> 00:01:47,370
You're a hipster king. Well, not really. This thing's on the Nintendo Switch right now.

11
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:58,010
So not really. I didn't like go get this on some secret place. You can literally get this

12
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:10,419
on Switch right now. What about Monster Breeder? It's possible we play Monster Breeder later

13
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:17,539
today. It really depends on how long these take. Because with some FMV games, some of these games

14
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:24,139
are 40 minutes. Some of them are three hours. It really depends on how many. Maybe if we play

15
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:30,300
through it again, if we move on to the next one, I don't know. It depends. We'll see.

16
00:02:30,939 --> 00:02:45,020
We can play among us. It's never gonna happen. It's gonna be awful or bad.

17
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:56,009
Is that what you said? Did I read that wrong? This is gonna be awful or bad. What about the

18
00:02:56,009 --> 00:03:01,689
Goosebumps FMV with Jeff Goldblum? I did not even know that existed. But now that I know that

19
00:03:01,689 --> 00:03:08,860
exists, I'm very interested. I'm like an FMV wine connoisseur. It doesn't matter how bad they are.

20
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:21,300
It doesn't matter how shitty they are. I have to play them. All of them, if I can. Also,

21
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:26,840
I want to make this really clear. There was a content warning on this game. Apparently,

22
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:32,680
it's pretty dated. I don't know exactly what that means. But like I said, it's on the

23
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:44,060
Switch. I don't exactly know what to be looking for. But we'll be on the ready.

24
00:03:44,699 --> 00:04:01,050
Are you gonna stream bad mojo? Probably not. So if we do come across something that's

25
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:07,990
fucking shitty and bad, you know, you fucking behave yourselves. Come on. Come on, Gwen.

26
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:26,819
You know what I mean? Are you gonna stream crab game? No, I don't. Every one of these

27
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:35,689
games it takes off. I don't play them. I watch. Okay, this with like trends on Twitch.

28
00:04:36,649 --> 00:04:41,370
It's kind of like how a lot of people jump into like the stock market and stuff.

29
00:04:42,329 --> 00:04:46,410
It's like a game will come along and I'll go that looks kind of cool. I would like to

30
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:51,610
maybe try that out. That looks like a great experience. And then I don't play it. And then

31
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:57,610
two or three weeks later, it's it's incredibly popular and everyone's on it. Oh, that's

32
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:01,209
awesome. I probably should have maybe I could get in now. I don't think I'm gonna get it. I

33
00:05:01,209 --> 00:05:05,449
you know, maybe it looks fun. Now it's like the biggest thing on Twitch, the biggest the

34
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:10,410
biggest thing in the world. I don't want to buy the top of the crab game meta.

35
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:16,310
You know what I mean? Stop calling me a hipster. Why are you saying that?

36
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,759
Why don't you stream McDonald's hamburger adventure? I don't even know what you're

37
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:38,759
talking about. All right, you guys ready? Apparently this is something else I read about

38
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:47,689
this too is the actor that's in this. They had to have him rerecord lines with the restoration.

39
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:55,160
And I mean, the guy's like almost 25 plus years older than he is. So I don't know how

40
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:05,379
that's gonna play out. But it might be pretty funny. But this is American hero. I am ready.

41
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:12,519
Our choices matter apparently. Are you gonna play Fortnite or should I just go?

42
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:20,620
You liar. Euro how many months up? You're a six month subscriber. You've been here for six months.

43
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:24,920
You know what happens on this channel. You're a liar. You're lying to everybody.

44
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:37,660
All right, you ready? Let's go. This is American hero. Viewer discretion is advised apparently.

45
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:50,620
And let's go. You ready? Oh, by the way, very important. That's the guy from That's My Bush

46
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:56,089
from Comedy Central. Yeah, I don't know if anyone remembers that show.

47
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:11,240
That was a really weird reference. But here we go. American hero. Yeah, okay. Well,

48
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:21,269
this right off the bat, right off the bat. I hope this I don't think there's any nudity.

49
00:07:21,269 --> 00:07:37,029
I hope not. No, there's not. Oh, God. My home away from home. It's I crystals looking

50
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:41,430
good today. I think that's the I think that's the voiceover. I think that's a new line.

51
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:51,290
Relax. Just care. Asshole. There is nudity. No, there's not. It's on the switch. It can't be.

52
00:07:52,089 --> 00:07:56,410
It's on the Nintendo Switch. It's impossible. They don't allow any nudity on the switch.

53
00:07:56,410 --> 00:08:08,970
That's a lie. It can't be possible. Here's trouble. They were right. Now you can piss

54
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:16,310
off Sergeant. It's Colonel. BFD. The old man has a problem. Why does it sound like he's

55
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:25,290
in a bathroom? Not interested. It involves Laura in a dangerous mind control virus.

56
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:32,490
Dangerous. Okay. I think she's been kidnapped. Can't say more.

57
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:36,250
It looks like Borderlands characters. It looks weird. Why? You're interested.

58
00:08:36,889 --> 00:08:44,809
Meet me somewhere a little more private. You're a big fucking dork. All right,

59
00:08:44,809 --> 00:08:47,529
let me pay attention to the game. A rock in a hard place.

60
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:58,779
I have to make a decision here. What do I want to do? Bad news. Bad news or party?

61
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:04,700
Party. What? Bad news. What's going on? What do I do?

62
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:21,750
Did he leave? Oh shit. Am I going to get run over by a car? Why is there a truck?

63
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:37,210
Do I have to move the QTE? What do I do? What do I do?

64
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:43,129
A ledge. Run. A ledge. Run. A ledge. Run. Run.

65
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:56,259
Jump. I'm going to jump. I'm going to drop. I'm going to drop. He's going to get run over.

66
00:10:01,299 --> 00:10:06,120
New item unlocked? Oh shit.

67
00:10:20,809 --> 00:10:31,259
Wait, hold on a second. Hold on. So I was in a strip club and then I was either going to

68
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:34,620
go do this mission or stay in the strip club. And then he left the strip club,

69
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:43,460
running away from a somebody in a Mack truck that ran my whole body over lengthwise,

70
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:50,409
which is fucking crazy. I got steamrolled. Okay. All right. No, Jesus. We have to do this

71
00:10:50,409 --> 00:10:57,450
again. I don't want to have to show this again. All right. What should I do? Should I?

72
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,850
I'm going to go get the bad news. I'm not clicking party on a game that has been

73
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:06,409
confirmed to have nudity in it. No way. Not going to happen. Nope. Not happening.

74
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:15,990
My home away from home. I could run up a lengthwise. That's fucking it ran up from

75
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:22,059
my heels. Looking good today. To the top of my head. That was insane. Hey, Sherlock,

76
00:11:22,059 --> 00:11:29,799
you got something against me making a living? Relax. Pinhead. I missed that last time as

77
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:40,789
well. He's drinking carrot juice. I don't get it. I don't believe there's nudity on

78
00:11:40,789 --> 00:11:49,659
the switch. Here's trouble. They were right. So now you can piss off. Oh, there's not.

79
00:11:50,299 --> 00:11:59,129
It's Colonel. BFD. The old man has a problem. I'm not clicking party. I'm not interested.

80
00:11:59,129 --> 00:12:13,700
Involves Laura in a dangerous mind control virus. I didn't mean to click that. I think

81
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:19,450
she's been kidnapped. Can't say more. It's upscaled with AI. You're interested.

82
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:24,649
It does actually. I'm actually kind of glad it looks like this because some of the old

83
00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:29,049
FMV games we've played in the past, they look like absolute dog shit. So this

84
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:35,450
doesn't really even look that bad. All right. No, no party. No, I have to get this right.

85
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:46,019
It's like a rhythm game. Bad news. Bad news. Bad news. Bad news. I clicked bad news.

86
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:53,960
I clicked bad news. I don't want to run away from the fucking truck. I clicked bad news.

87
00:12:54,759 --> 00:13:00,899
I clicked. What the fuck? No, I'm. How do I skip the cut scene?

88
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:09,850
I'm not going to get run over again. The truck is bad news. Oh, no, it's not. I didn't do

89
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:16,039
anything last time. All right. All right. This time don't drop. This time I'm going to,

90
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:28,309
I'm going to go for the ledge. Ledge. Ledge. Run. Ledge. Run. Ledge. Ledge. Run. Is he doing it?

91
00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:38,070
What? He's not making decisions. What the fuck? Drop. Jump. Drop. I can't do anything.

92
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:56,600
Do you hear me clicking? Do you hear this? Why doesn't the game work? Mouse one. I'm clicking

93
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:11,529
mouse one. Oh, this is not good. It's not right click. It's left click, right? Maybe I

94
00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:18,409
should unplug the controller. I don't think I have one and plugged in. I mean, the mouse

95
00:14:18,409 --> 00:14:24,299
apps. Yeah, that's left click. I don't think. No, there's no controller plugged in.

96
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:36,840
It's just my mouse. I was spamming too. 10 second reaction time. Try right clicking. Hold on.

97
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:50,179
Options. Dirty full screen. Set keys. Set. OK, select left click, right? Yeah. Action space.

98
00:14:51,539 --> 00:15:05,539
There'll be pressing. Well, why would it say left click? I guess I'm going to try to hit

99
00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:13,980
space. It's also up, down, left, right as well. Well, I'll try space. God damn it.

100
00:15:16,789 --> 00:15:22,070
All right, I'll try space. You better believe I'm going to try to make sure this get this to

101
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:26,789
work. You don't get run over lengthwise by a car like that and not like play out at least

102
00:15:26,789 --> 00:15:35,340
some of the game. You kidding me? No way. All right, let me see what happens. The tutorial

103
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:40,460
doesn't give you it just tells you like the gist of the game. I read it already. All

104
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:48,200
right. Can I skip this cut scene? How do you skip cut scene? Escape. There's definitely a way

105
00:15:48,200 --> 00:16:02,379
to do it. Enter. I mean, it tab works. My home away from home. Right click. No,

106
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:10,970
that's definitely a way to do it. Looking good today. I'm going to see if space works.

107
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,399
Pinhead. Are you making us watch this? I'm not making you watch this again.

108
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:35,240
I'm trying the game's controls are not accurate. Here's trouble. They were right.

109
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:43,190
Now you can piss off. Sergeant. It's Colonel. BFD. The old man has a problem.

110
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:49,269
He needs your help. Not interested. Bad news space. It involves law. It doesn't work that

111
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:55,909
I don't know what I'm going to do. It's not the game. Oh, should I like? Should

112
00:16:55,909 --> 00:17:02,059
I plug it to controller in? I think she's been kidnapped. Can't say more walls have ears.

113
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:06,059
If you're interested, meet me somewhere a little more private.

114
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:24,250
And let's see. Base rock in a hard place. Come on, please work. Please work. Bad news.

115
00:17:25,289 --> 00:17:35,779
Space. It's fucking space. What is that meter at the top? I know you'd make the right

116
00:17:35,779 --> 00:17:41,619
choice. Okay, Colonel, this better be good. I hope I still get run over by a fucking truck.

117
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:50,359
I'm sure Laura would be impressed. I'm not here on a social visit.

118
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:55,799
So many cigarettes. Kruger's escaped. It's up to his old tricks. Laura was working for us.

119
00:17:55,799 --> 00:18:01,319
She developed an antivirus formula that kidnapped her before she could get it to us.

120
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:06,119
Tell me about the virus. The old man will do that. What matters is you want Laura.

121
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:13,220
We want the antivirus formula. Okay. No, that's not. That's not Nick Cage.

122
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:20,869
Jack, can you get it up for another? Fuck you. Yes. Fuck you. Yes.

123
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:26,250
I just blacked out.

124
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:33,289
Why did I black out? What was the point of blacking out?

125
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:43,750
Oh, it's sensor. Get it. Split. Lemon. Get it. Lemon. No, no, no, no, no, no.

126
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:48,170
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. It's all the Switch. It's

127
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,490
on the Switch. It's all the Switch. It's all the Nintendo Switch. It's not gonna happen.

128
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:55,829
It's not gonna happen. It's all the Nintendo Switch. It's just drinking big water. That's

129
00:18:55,829 --> 00:18:58,230
it. It's all the Nintendo Switch. It's not gonna happen. Things are looking up.

130
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,710
No, they're not. They're not no. They're not. I have to get out of this.

131
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:04,150
That's three options. I think I'm playing a fucking Mario Party game where you have to

132
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:08,309
like hit the dice at the right time. Give me a break. That's weird. I don't. Okay. Get

228
00:35:54,780 --> 00:36:22,559

229
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:32,800
decisions probably break I yeah okay what if I hit gas here's what the

230
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:43,599
other option this game is having a nightmare it is

231
00:36:43,599 --> 00:37:14,320
kind of having a nightmare it's break break is the right play we're gonna get

232
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:38,960
the same ending it's my lucky day this is the outrageous is brave the way Jack

233
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:45,960
would watch it be ashes to ashes dust to dust what was the budget for this

234
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,400
game I don't know but the crazy story about this game is that you weren't

235
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:56,679
here in the very beginning this game was never released it it was done

236
00:37:56,679 --> 00:38:00,079
filming and I don't know if they ran the studio ran out of money or something

237
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:04,079
but it was never actually released a new company came in and kind of

238
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:08,119
remastered all the footage and restored it it's the only reason why

239
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:25,579
we're playing it today okay it's great great oh it's just was in a Jaguar

240
00:38:25,579 --> 00:38:46,289
right we're not arguing about McDonald's or Wendy's we're talking

241
00:38:46,289 --> 00:39:08,119
about life and death here there we go okay we're good on to the next sequence

242
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:28,250
what are you waiting for let's go okay what is this pretty tight security

243
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:38,239
this is the lab why would I just walk to the front door like a fucking sim

244
00:39:38,239 --> 00:40:05,840
that's a neighbor what are you doing oh what are you doing he was wearing a

00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:08,800
it was a rubber hand I will release my virus into the system within minutes

248
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:16,889
the disease will ripple out exponent it will be the greatest biological

249
00:41:16,889 --> 00:41:26,699
conquest of all boys in the water oh that's why they're drinking the water

250

253
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:34,329

254
00:42:34,329 --> 00:42:38,449
retirement I came out of retirement to solve this madman poisoning the water

256
00:43:03,409 --> 00:43:07,530
bulb is so expensive that's very okay we're gonna take the solution here

257
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:17,650
quick okay all right right right hairpin the guard hairpin the guard do the

258
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:38,159
medical salt I'm sick I have diarrhea what something anti-virus formula has

259
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:44,920
an error yeah yeah he's gonna get crushed what would you open the door

260
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:49,679
without like a weapon yeah I was in the middle of pressing the squish

261
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:56,000
what do you want we're gonna help you with oh yeah they told me never to do

262
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,480
one thing I forget what it was I think it was don't ever open this fucking door

263
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:10,719
when people are in it that wasn't even cartoon logic that was like they had a

264
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:14,199
whole scene and like they had like that the scene they threw the whole

265
00:44:14,199 --> 00:44:16,960
scene away and they had to get an extra to be that guy like there was

266
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:21,679
like a full ten minutes of dialogue there left right left that was a

267
00:44:21,679 --> 00:44:31,519
reshoot left right they had a whole sequence with a guard oh shit they went

268
00:44:31,519 --> 00:45:07,829
left oh god oh here we go oh no don't push her into the way sound effect if

269
00:45:07,829 --> 00:45:10,550
you type in punch sound effect on YouTube right now that's the first

270
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:18,619
that's exactly the first one I have not had a decision to make they're

271
00:45:18,619 --> 00:45:24,230
just doing it on their own the AI is just picking direction left right

272
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:37,869
left right right that'll do holy shit she's running way faster than me and

273
00:45:37,869 --> 00:45:48,170
she's in heels that's crazy left right oh my god I have no idea

274
00:45:48,170 --> 00:46:07,980

275
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:13,070
gonna see this guy again I that's the wrong way I think if you make the

276
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:16,989
wrong decision you go in a circle you see that guy every time we're

277
00:46:16,989 --> 00:46:40,679
gonna see him again um right left right right that'll do we're about to

278
00:46:40,679 --> 00:46:50,960
loop again is that guy gonna get up again not just shoot that guy left

279
00:46:50,960 --> 00:47:13,099
right not again all right there's no way that guy comes back another time

280
00:47:13,099 --> 00:47:19,159
it's not possible you understand it's not possible that guy's back he flew

281
00:47:19,159 --> 00:47:31,800
off of a balcony like 15 feet no way I need to know right I have no that guy's

282
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:52,400

283
00:47:52,400 --> 00:48:01,559

284
00:48:01,559 --> 00:48:21,010
shots there's two there now okay oh no we just we got an we got the end card

285

287
00:48:52,219 --> 00:48:58,380
get at least some kind of other ending and having far too much fun to

288
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:12,750
let's go again let's try a new route let's go wait unlockable find every way

289
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:17,469
to end the game at Jack's funeral reach all the endings where Jack

290
00:49:17,469 --> 00:49:24,139

353
01:03:58,309 --> 01:04:02,730
really bad one to have to redo it's been people walking around setting up

367
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:46,849
Krueger I can't shoot him from up here oh I hope the checkpoints really close I

368
01:07:46,849 --> 01:07:53,719
thought I was gonna snipe him from all the way back there that would have

369
01:07:53,719 --> 01:08:19,920
been so funny oh I was right at the checkpoint good very good yeah it's

370
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:21,840
this it's not I think it's time for this guy to go back to the

371
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:37,279
drawing board mojo Jojo tried this like three times already all right oh

372
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:46,079
god damn it all right whatever it's all right it's all right we've

373
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:50,359
watched this whole thing again all right this time I'm gonna who should I

374
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:58,949
shoot I point the gun at Hoover who should I point the gun at then not the

375
01:08:58,949 --> 01:09:02,550
barrels right I thought the barrels is a great idea I'm gonna shoot the barrel

376
01:09:02,550 --> 01:09:05,869
which is gonna destroy everything and everyone's gonna get the virus or

377
01:09:05,869 --> 01:09:08,409
whatever all over them right that was like okay but then the guy just came

378
01:09:08,409 --> 01:09:13,359
behind me the extra came behind me and hit me in the head so I was

379
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:17,220
supposed to know that was gonna happen it's gonna take it's gonna

380
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:22,810

383
01:09:44,470 --> 01:09:49,750
think we'll get it this time skip no way not in a hundred million years

384
01:09:49,750 --> 01:10:13,380
let's go all right we're gonna aim the gun at Hoover I feel like Hoover's

385
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:15,979
gonna be like no no don't shoot me all right hold this is what's gonna

386
01:10:15,979 --> 01:10:24,439
happen don't shoot me this guy's a snake right goodbye Hoover goodbye Kruger

387
01:10:28,810 --> 01:10:44,579
I said the guy looks like Joe Biden no it looks like it looks like somebody

388
01:10:44,579 --> 01:10:49,079
took young Joe Biden and put them in one of those age of five apps to make

389
01:10:49,079 --> 01:11:15,960
old Joe Biden that's what it looks like all right we got to aim at this

390
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:22,420
guy go after him because I feel like you'll probably get another decision

391
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:33,939
guns don't even have barrels really bringing the crane well it gets the

392
01:11:33,939 --> 01:11:36,739
same message

01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:51,020
don't screw this up I don't want to watch the first five minutes of every

394
01:11:51,020 --> 01:12:13,500
RTS phase no I don't want to watch this don't have much time okay here

395
01:12:13,539 --> 01:12:33,680
we go over construction complete building building construction complete

396
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:45,199
unit lost unit lost Kruger Hoover drums what the fuck who did that and they

397
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:56,560

pick the goon I know I'm I don't care about him he's nothing to me kill him

401
01:13:28,029 --> 01:13:39,949
it has to be the main guy but can I even get to the main guy I damn it that's so

402
01:13:39,949 --> 01:13:55,800
funny it has to be a way to skip I'd really don't think there is it's space

403
01:13:55,800 --> 01:14:06,079
I don't know I don't think it is yeah hey yeah this is very important to

404
01:14:06,079 --> 01:14:24,029
remember this is 25 years old it's 25 years old how old are these actors

405
01:14:24,029 --> 01:14:30,829
now the craziest part is the main character recorded voice lines with

406
01:14:30,909 --> 01:14:37,350
this remaster so how old is this main character here probably in his I want to

407
01:14:37,350 --> 01:14:43,920
say probably the 40s maybe early 40s probably so this this person the actor

408
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:59,100
might actually be in their late 60s into early 70s late 30s early 40s yeah

409
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:04,979
that's another thing spam every button no it doesn't do any I'm telling

410
01:15:04,979 --> 01:15:12,699
you there is no skip he's George Bush from that's my bush gotta get

411
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:36,409
it was on Comedy Central he's almost as old as you are now now what I forgot

412
01:15:36,409 --> 01:15:40,760
about that's why Bush yeah that was correct me if I'm wrong but that was

413
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:46,399
Trey Parker and Matt Stone made that show or at least Trey Parker did South

414
01:15:46,399 --> 01:15:50,979
Park guys I think it was only live for like four episodes or like six

415
01:15:50,979 --> 01:16:10,069
episodes goodbye Hoover goodbye Kruger here we go don't screw this up Bill

417
01:16:19,970 --> 01:16:28,359

419
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:47,060

420
01:16:47,060 --> 01:17:24,010
funny as you said it was okay where is he brain is the big moment that's not

421
01:17:24,010 --> 01:17:28,090
even that's not even close it's his face is so pixelated in what is this

422
01:17:28,090 --> 01:17:33,319

423
01:17:33,319 --> 01:17:38,279

429
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:54,770

430
01:18:54,770 --> 01:19:01,340
here you did Hoover last time no I tried to shoot him from down here I

431
01:19:01,340 --> 01:19:13,279
grabbed his gun I tried to aim up at him and he shot her in the head

432
01:19:25,930 --> 01:19:31,010
it's still a little bit in there I just picked that thing up and just

433
01:19:31,010 --> 01:19:35,569
start going I would start inhaling right because you get like the

434
01:19:35,569 --> 01:19:38,489
vapors in my help a little

435
01:19:43,220 --> 01:19:54,130
yeah or like just touch a little bit of the wetness and get it again you

436
01:19:54,130 --> 01:19:57,409
mucous membranes just put your fingers in your nose all the way

437
01:19:57,409 --> 01:19:59,489
back and try to get it in there you get absorbed in your mucous

438
01:19:59,489 --> 01:20:19,729
membranes I really don't want to have to view this whole thing again so

439
01:20:19,729 --> 01:20:31,090
this better be right take it away did Hoover last time no I didn't I tried

440
01:20:31,090 --> 01:20:34,250
to shoot up at Kruger I was like I'm gonna shoot him from here and I aimed

441
01:20:34,250 --> 01:20:39,529
down sights and he killed Laura it's Hoover I'm gonna pick Hoover

01:25:45,380 --> 01:25:58,069
a coffee and then I had nothing else I don't eat it's hard to eat

471
01:25:58,069 --> 01:26:04,409
breakfast when I get up in the morning and going all the way into the early

472
01:26:04,409 --> 01:26:10,420
afternoon I can't eat anything thought of eating breakfast a lot of times make

473
01:26:10,420 --> 01:26:16,760
me kind of like nauseous I'm just not ready for food the first three or four

474
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:28,310
hours when I get up but coffee that I can do I usually eat lunch lunch some

475
01:26:28,310 --> 01:26:34,069
kind of snack some kind of small mid late kind of afternoon meal and then

476
01:26:34,069 --> 01:26:44,300
I do dinner breakfast is overrated anyways I mean breakfast is

477
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:51,560
incredibly important your body needs fuel to burn so you can function it's

478
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:56,539
important to do something you have any he'll I actually don't have any heels

479
01:26:56,539 --> 01:27:08,039
left smoothies are good yeah that's that's a good idea you're being played

480
01:27:08,039 --> 01:27:22,739
by big breakfast okay let me get this remember this drum Hoover fight drum

of cereals are just cotton candy with vitamin powder sprinkled all over it

485
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:35,199
pretty much the same thing Kruger over drums drums I feel like that would be a

486
01:28:35,199 --> 01:28:43,680
great skrillex intro I mean don't shoot the drum call them off or you're

487

539
01:38:44,399 --> 01:38:51,869
though I'm so glad that we get to like see this and experience this

540
01:38:51,949 --> 01:39:06,949
harvester meets James Bond harvester was fucked I would not play that game a

541
01:39:06,949 --> 01:39:19,100
second time all right let's start the process here get the audio back where

542
01:39:19,100 --> 01:39:32,220
it should be all right let's go I didn't realize the run he screams run

543
01:39:32,220 --> 01:40:04,989
at the people drum Kruger Hoover drum from over fight yet and if there's

544
01:40:04,989 --> 01:40:07,909
something afterwards again I have to remind myself a thousand times it's

545
01:40:07,909 --> 01:40:11,880
fight if there's another choice is therefore I would have taken the

546
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:30,039
antidote marijuana is a memory loss drug I'm not

547
01:40:30,079 --> 01:40:54,750
that would have been a huge mistake for this dream these serious don't get it

548
01:40:54,750 --> 01:40:59,109
wrong every cell in your body is gonna mutate you're gonna be another one of

549
01:40:59,109 --> 01:41:10,699
dr. Kruger's mindless zombies get it is wrong then that's not my fault

550
01:41:10,699 --> 01:41:16,180
because you all we all have come to a consensus here that I need to get it

551
01:41:16,180 --> 01:41:24,880
when it's on the ground because otherwise I turn into the zombie

552
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:34,430
we get a poll we get a short poll as to what I should do on the second after

553
01:41:34,430 --> 01:41:39,789
I fight the first time in a poll I need because I if I'm gonna be wrong I

554
01:41:39,789 --> 01:41:42,189
need a bunch of people to be wrong too so we can all be wrong together so

555
01:41:42,189 --> 01:41:54,210
I don't feel as bad bite or get on the second attempt one that we just

556
01:41:54,250 --> 01:42:04,310
died at we go within three minutes Los Angeles will be mine perhaps you might

557
01:42:04,310 --> 01:42:16,569

558
01:42:16,569 --> 01:42:40,079

559
01:42:40,079 --> 01:42:59,539
Wilhelm Wilhelm okay why do we got anything 80% yet so if I'm wrong you're

560
01:42:59,539 --> 01:43:30,670
wrong too this guy shoots so many bullets like I

561
01:43:30,670 --> 01:43:42,619
probably gonna throw in a rock and hit me easier than his shooting okay

562
01:43:42,619 --> 01:44:15,819
right right yeah I swear to God if it's not like rabbit fight there we go I

563

571
01:46:51,060 --> 01:47:09,939
without her that's cool we need an alternate ending all right I am willing

572
01:47:09,939 --> 01:47:13,659
to play through one and not play through I just want to say there's

573
01:47:13,659 --> 01:47:21,770
some stuff early that I really want to see there's a lot of other shit

574
01:47:21,770 --> 01:47:38,180
that we need to know where it goes play I start from the beginning oh

575
01:47:38,319 --> 01:47:48,489

582
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:01,479
actually censored this re-release the original game did have nudity

583
01:49:01,479 --> 01:49:07,289
interesting okay

584
01:49:10,689 --> 01:49:18,859
pinhead the voiceover lines were not in the original now no way the actor

585
01:49:18,859 --> 01:49:25,229
actually came back to rerecord them I'm surprised they didn't port this to

586
01:49:25,229 --> 01:49:30,619
something else here's trouble this whole thing was done even if it was

587
01:49:30,619 --> 01:49:33,539
not on the Jaguar why would they not release it all right so now you can piss

off Sega Saturn or something take a CD it's Colonel BFD the old man has a

589
01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:48,550
problem not interested it involves Laura and a dangerous mind control

590
01:49:48,550 --> 01:49:57,380

adults-only rating balls have ears if you're interested meet me somewhere a

592
01:50:02,420 --> 01:50:06,920
little more private and you nudity in any piece of media is gonna have

593
01:50:06,920 --> 01:50:15,810
that especially in a game ESRB rock in a hard place like real people on camera

594
01:50:15,810 --> 01:50:24,710

way through the game and then just now what February I don't want to do that

701
02:13:25,750 --> 02:13:30,630
struggled to clear my head I clicked on my flashlight and looked around

702
02:13:30,630 --> 02:13:35,310
any fool could see that the place had more than its share of dingbats and

703
02:13:35,310 --> 02:13:42,310

715
02:15:28,819 --> 02:15:34,060
gonna do something clever I was trying to think of a diversion when I

716
02:15:34,260 --> 02:15:47,430
started to slip away as the rope bit into my neck what do I do wait I didn't

717
02:15:47,430 --> 02:15:53,250

718
02:15:53,250 --> 02:16:03,390
impression on laughing boy okay make good use of the rope take the candle

719
02:16:03,390 --> 02:16:15,010
and go uh take the candle I grabbed a candle and headed out a sudden

720
02:16:15,010 --> 02:16:19,329
breeze blew out my candle and I could barely make out my surroundings in the

721
02:16:19,329 --> 02:16:26,720
darkness I should have taken the rope or something use your last match go look

722

737
02:18:28,579 --> 02:18:33,540

02:18:33,540 --> 02:18:40,559
your investigation yeah we got gum shoot got the we got gum overconfidence

757
02:20:46,959 --> 02:20:56,690
the dear hatchet Institute was founded by a Nobel prize-winning scientist who

758
02:20:56,690 --> 02:21:01,450
disappeared in the late 50s leaving the place deserted for nearly 30 years

759
02:21:01,450 --> 02:21:07,450
it's packaged up I walked up the creeping front steps and turned the knob all

760
02:21:07,450 --> 02:21:12,500
right the ladies here I have a choice to turn around or get the key from under

761
02:21:12,500 --> 02:21:18,350
the mat and then what do I do about the lady try just naturally talk to the

762
02:21:18,350 --> 02:21:25,389
lady there was a key to fit the front door under the mat the stench was

763
02:21:25,389 --> 02:21:30,229
awful it was like entering a tube I just keep running from the layers to

764
02:21:30,229 --> 02:21:35,389
my right and a room to my left and I felt a cold chill on the back of my

765
02:21:35,389 --> 02:21:45,170
neck carefully climb should I carefully climb the stairs yeah if I sneak I

766
02:21:45,170 --> 02:21:50,370
probably can as I ascended the rotting stairs I began to feel as if I were

767
02:21:50,370 --> 02:22:01,229
being followed from the top of the stairs I could see a woman below okay

768
02:22:01,229 --> 02:22:14,180
I don't have a weapon holy water use the holy water her skin erupted as

769
02:22:14,180 --> 02:22:25,079
the water splashed on the stench was awful the second floor looked dark and

770
02:22:25,079 --> 02:22:33,600
uninviting okay that was a waste I don't know if I could have got away check

771
02:22:33,600 --> 02:22:38,399
on her condition run into the nearest room right I don't you have so much

772
02:22:38,399 --> 02:22:46,600
there's not enough time my fear faded as I fled I felt fine till I fell so

773
02:22:46,600 --> 02:22:50,799
I flipped over and found I'd been followed by a fanged femme fatale with

774
02:22:50,799 --> 02:22:59,719
a fried finger it's her use the vial of holy water I don't do I have it kick

775
02:22:59,719 --> 02:23:06,010
her teeth out oh I don't still have any left it wasn't till I cut my hand on

776
02:23:06,010 --> 02:23:09,950
the broken glass that I realized that the bottle of holy water wasn't

777
02:23:09,950 --> 02:23:23,219
shatterproof I just well here we go again I don't know how long I was out

778
02:23:23,219 --> 02:23:28,500
but someone or something had dragged me to a seller below der Hatchet

779
02:23:28,700 --> 02:23:34,989
is this guy as I struggled to clear my head I clicked on my flashlight and

780
02:23:34,989 --> 02:23:38,909
looked around which disappeared after the fool could see that the place had

781
02:23:38,909 --> 02:23:44,430
more than its share of dingbats and I was no exception

782
02:23:45,229 --> 02:23:52,940
find who dragged you in here explode go looking for trouble find who dragged

783
02:23:52,940 --> 02:23:58,819
you here I don't I think these are all the same thing it was there in

784
02:23:58,819 --> 02:24:03,819
the cellar that I discovered the little man with the evil grin what's

785
02:24:03,819 --> 02:24:07,030
the correct play here

786
02:24:21,799 --> 02:24:26,540
all right so now what are the choices don't lunge at him grab his shovel

787
02:24:26,540 --> 02:24:34,899
glance past him say don't turn around and you bait him he fell for it so I

788
02:24:34,979 --> 02:24:41,059
took the opportunity to bash him in the chops I never hit a man when he's down

789
02:24:41,059 --> 02:24:45,659
but I knew I should have white an exception when I felt his fingers on

790
02:24:45,659 --> 02:24:57,809
my throat you can't be serious I have to flip that second off she's not

791
02:24:57,809 --> 02:25:04,049
gonna do anything flip up I flipped him into his coal bin and ran into the

792
02:25:04,090 --> 02:25:12,379
darkness that's not gonna kill me okay laundry why would I hit somebody with a

793
02:25:12,379 --> 02:25:15,340
shovel and be like you know I don't hit a person when they're down even if

794
02:25:15,340 --> 02:25:23,280
they're a degenerate murdering zombie person find an elevator find an

795
02:25:23,280 --> 02:25:34,280
elevator I found myself ascending a steep circular stairway when a green

796
02:25:34,280 --> 02:25:40,360
ghoul in a rented tuxedo made a dramatic entrance these people just

797
02:25:40,399 --> 02:25:44,360
went to the Halloween store and bought everything on the rack and then just

798
02:25:44,360 --> 02:25:48,739
decided to shoot stuff with it and they made choices around it they were just

799
02:25:48,739 --> 02:25:53,790
having a they're just having like fun for like a weekend let's make some

800
02:25:53,790 --> 02:25:59,250
small talk see if it works I approached the zombie reluctant took his hat off

801
02:25:59,250 --> 02:26:11,049
and asked him who his tailor was his response he took his hat off like oh

802
02:26:11,049 --> 02:26:30,719
it's me hello oh floor surprise me um surprise me we arrived on the first

803
02:26:30,719 --> 02:26:36,040
floor and I got off I could hear faint piano music coming from somewhere

804
02:26:36,040 --> 02:26:45,680
piano music this is it could be anything I have no idea um enter the

805
02:26:45,680 --> 02:26:54,840
room on the left the room was crawling with vermin but otherwise

806
02:26:55,280 --> 02:27:06,780
empty they're so cute they just have that is vibing leave him alone follow the

807
02:27:06,780 --> 02:27:17,889
rats yeah they know what they're doing the next room I came to had nothing in

808
02:27:17,889 --> 02:27:23,540
it there was an old freezer on one side and a wall full of potions on the

809
02:27:23,540 --> 02:27:31,549
other Frank one of the random potions just as I started to examine them I

810
02:27:31,549 --> 02:27:48,819
heard a scream okay find a place to hide open the freezer I'm putting the few

811
02:27:48,819 --> 02:27:56,200
reasons I opened the freezer be only to find another prisoner of this horrible

812
02:27:56,200 --> 02:27:59,780
place

813
02:28:16,540 --> 02:28:20,540
we have to keep this guy alive

814
02:28:27,780 --> 02:28:31,139
you wouldn't have a car by any chance you wouldn't be going to your Fresno

815
02:28:31,139 --> 02:28:41,780
area Fresno's really not that far he was unfortunately an obnoxious jerk

816
02:28:41,780 --> 02:28:46,540
who didn't have anything intelligent off money or a cigarette you thought

817
02:28:46,540 --> 02:28:50,540
what a jerk it's remarkably still alive what are you talking about this

818
02:28:50,540 --> 02:28:55,020
guy could probably help see what he knows about the house what do you know

819
02:28:55,020 --> 02:28:59,340
about the house you've been here probably for a while oh shit the

820
02:28:59,940 --> 02:29:04,219
crazy I mean I couldn't get out of the box how am I supposed to know how to get

821
02:29:04,219 --> 02:29:09,540
out of the house no no man don't don't leave man look I just give me five

822
02:29:09,540 --> 02:29:15,059

823
02:29:15,059 --> 02:29:19,959
I swear he just wouldn't let me go this is a monster this might be a

824
02:29:19,959 --> 02:29:26,620
monster in the house maybe this is not a person I give him five bucks I

825
02:29:26,860 --> 02:29:43,799
gave him five dollars and left okay leave this loony bin behind search

826
02:29:43,799 --> 02:29:53,040
remaining rooms search remaining rooms that actually might have been a

827
02:29:53,040 --> 02:30:03,350
monster to the next room I heard the scream again take the source of the

828
02:30:03,350 --> 02:30:11,549
scream we have to know we have to know returning to the hall I glanced

829
02:30:11,549 --> 02:30:23,670
up to where the sound came from Jesus see run away right but I don't know

830
02:30:23,670 --> 02:30:30,520
see what he does next run see what he does

831
02:30:30,520 --> 02:30:47,379
was thrashing about so I backed up and gave him plenty of room I don't but what

832
02:30:47,379 --> 02:31:08,450
if what if he's not hostile I don't we might not be hostile how yeah but you

833
02:31:08,450 --> 02:31:14,329

834
02:31:14,329 --> 02:31:20,059
that I was I was fit to be tied all right so we got this right last time

835
02:31:20,059 --> 02:31:22,940
life hung in the balance we have to like tie this guy up or something this

836
02:31:22,940 --> 02:31:47,979
was no time for reflection if I didn't stream I would probably be this guy

837
02:31:48,020 --> 02:31:55,219
like if I was on a streamer what did YouTube or something I would have

838
02:31:55,219 --> 02:32:00,899
probably been that guy at some point something clever I was trying to

839
02:32:00,899 --> 02:32:07,479
think of a diversion when I lost this was the right thing last thing hit

840
02:32:07,479 --> 02:32:20,959
something okay you need to get the rope I got up I saw monster or the

841
02:32:20,959 --> 02:32:27,360

842
02:32:27,360 --> 02:32:37,280
actor oh my god all right make good use of the rope I told laughing boy he was

843
02:32:37,280 --> 02:32:42,219
bound to be out of circulation for a while but he didn't appreciate the

844
02:32:42,219 --> 02:32:51,250
gag okay head for the hallway exploded look for a sign and head for the

845
02:32:51,250 --> 02:33:02,790
hallway I guess artifacts you are that's what the piano music's coming

846

artifacts or music room we already did the elevator I don't want to go back in

847
02:33:07,329 --> 02:33:19,860

848
02:33:19,860 --> 02:33:27,040
the der hatchet family crest on the desk were many items of interest hey

849
02:33:27,040 --> 02:33:39,200
old coins wine cryptic runes decipher the ruins just as I picked up the

850
02:33:39,200 --> 02:33:48,270
papers the candle lit itself and a funky phantom friar floated into the room

851
02:33:53,309 --> 02:34:01,520
this guy looks friendly okay burn his papers enjoy wine and candlelight he's

852
02:34:01,520 --> 02:34:06,239
snapping his fingers the candle and a glass of the house vino and the

853
02:34:06,239 --> 02:34:13,540
phantom friar gave up the ghost what I didn't want to kill him he just wanted

854
02:34:13,540 --> 02:34:23,770
to hang out oops well I guess I won half of these monsters come up to me

855
02:34:23,770 --> 02:34:37,260
varied non-hostile I'll get the golden split I'll get the gold music

856
02:34:37,260 --> 02:34:47,979
room I want to go to the music room quickly leave the cellar search the

857
02:34:47,979 --> 02:34:59,079
cell where's the music room just leave the cellar oh it's this guy

music room whistle a happy tune first floor say second floor second floor

859
02:35:10,860 --> 02:35:18,219
we're already on the first floor the second floor look dark and

860
02:35:18,219 --> 02:35:36,000
uninviting it could room at random find the kitchen the room I next entered

861
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:42,139
was obviously a library of some sort great job finding the kitchen there

862
02:35:42,139 --> 02:35:46,100
is there was a door to my left another dead ahead but most of the

863
02:35:46,100 --> 02:35:51,020
action was taking place in the kitchen on my right someone was practicing a

864
02:35:51,020 --> 02:36:03,989
bizarre form of culinary preparation right let's go right let's see I

865
02:36:03,989 --> 02:36:08,610
couldn't put my finger on it but there was something odd about the

866
02:36:08,610 --> 02:36:21,389
woman in the kitchen I think maybe it was her three-day beard okay grab

867
02:36:21,389 --> 02:36:36,290
some food and go can I look in the fridge oh it's Edna fine a find the

868
02:36:36,290 --> 02:36:41,200
edibles find the edibles everybody on this house is on them might as well

869
02:36:41,200 --> 02:36:47,159
join a clove of garlic and a couple of potatoes definitely take the garlic

870
02:36:47,159 --> 02:37:08,620
shut that down the boss's throat of garlic okay I'm gonna leave sneak away

871
02:37:08,620 --> 02:37:13,540
quietly I don't want to do anything else out of the kitchen and left her to

872
02:37:13,739 --> 02:37:23,760
work a faint breeze carried a musty odor to my sensitive nostrils okay well

873
02:37:23,760 --> 02:37:27,159
over to the closed door okay we're gonna peek through that I'm not going

874
02:37:27,159 --> 02:37:35,139
in there just yet this room seemed to be a laboratory there was something

875
02:37:35,139 --> 02:37:45,610
odd about it and then I realized what it was the room suddenly I realized

876
02:37:45,610 --> 02:37:53,719
that someone was coming up behind me it's a vampire see the teeth jump in

877
02:37:53,719 --> 02:38:01,139
the tub and quickly jump in the tub thinking quickly I stepped into the

878
02:38:01,139 --> 02:38:07,520
shower and pulled the curtain closed a hairy paw reached in and turned on

879
02:38:07,520 --> 02:38:16,579
the water I peered around the corner and saw a she wolf busily primping

880
02:38:16,579 --> 02:38:26,200
yourself for a night on the town this is such a crack game it really is what

I didn't even have a chance okay we know what to do with this this is a

925
02:45:40,069 --> 02:45:42,489
this whole thing's a wash let's see if I stand on what happens but I was

926
02:45:42,489 --> 02:46:01,739
trying to think of a diversion when I think they all do the same thing I got

927
02:46:01,739 --> 02:46:08,030
up I saw that the pipe it made quite an impression okay use the rope

928
02:46:08,030 --> 02:46:17,290

931
02:46:44,260 --> 02:46:53,889

932
02:46:53,889 --> 02:47:05,530
gracefully this is the elevator guy okay makes polite talk he puts me in

933
02:47:05,530 --> 02:47:07,690
the elevator I don't want to go anywhere though I don't want to go back

934
02:47:07,690 --> 02:47:21,190
down I'm surprised but I don't what if I don't say anything will he keep me on

935
02:47:21,190 --> 02:47:39,020
this floor somewhere back in the elevator right down the hallway the

936
02:47:39,020 --> 02:47:43,020
next room I came to had nothing in it all right here's there was an old

937
02:47:43,020 --> 02:47:48,059
freezer on one side okay we're gonna try to get more info from the hippie

938
02:47:48,139 --> 02:48:26,809
okay do you know any escape options what if I don't give him five bucks what

939
02:48:26,809 --> 02:48:39,389

strength potion instant steak pill anti-grav tablets instant steak instant

941
02:48:49,920 --> 02:48:58,219
strength steak or strength steak or straight steak I wasn't hungry now but

942
02:48:58,219 --> 02:49:05,659
an instant steak might come in handy later yeah we have to put this into

943
02:49:05,659 --> 02:49:13,110
his wine right because it goes in you and it's a steak and you what

944
02:49:13,110 --> 02:49:19,049
about the stench why does it smell because then it'll the steak will blow

945
02:49:19,049 --> 02:49:28,969
up in his body right it sticks to your ribs yeah that means that it's gonna

946
02:49:28,969 --> 02:49:35,719
turn into a steak inside your body you could bathe more off all right I

947
02:49:35,719 --> 02:49:39,579
gotta leave we're gonna we're gonna both die from this like poison I gave

948
02:49:39,579 --> 02:49:48,030
him five dollars and left if the vampire eats this somehow whether we

949
02:49:48,030 --> 02:49:52,680
have I don't know how we get it to have him to eat it all right we're

950
02:49:52,680 --> 02:49:58,110
gonna leave we're gonna leave leave leave he takes it yeah but that he

951
02:49:58,110 --> 02:50:01,809
takes yourself if you die which I haven't died yet if I get knocked out

952
02:50:01,809 --> 02:50:06,889
again yeah I ran into the next room I heard the scream again this guy we

953
02:50:06,889 --> 02:50:13,819
just do avoid this do not go investigate this at all just keep no

954
02:50:13,819 --> 02:50:19,969
keep moving forward this guy knocks you up I ran through the door and found

955
02:50:19,969 --> 02:50:25,530
myself near the elevator okay up I pushed the button and waited there

956
02:50:25,530 --> 02:50:37,209
was a green door to my left and a stairway to my right wait for the

957
02:50:37,250 --> 02:50:45,120
elevator but what if he comes out what's behind the green door I walked over and

958
02:50:45,120 --> 02:50:49,120
opened the green door well the last thing I remember is staring at the

959
02:50:49,120 --> 02:51:02,700
hole in his chest where a steak should have been oh come on come on I

960
02:51:02,700 --> 02:51:08,819
came to in an attic someone or something was sitting across the attic

961
02:51:09,420 --> 02:51:10,420
shit

962
02:51:12,100 --> 02:51:14,100
Don't go look for double E

963
02:51:20,979 --> 02:51:22,979
I wonder if this way I can get through this

964
02:51:29,780 --> 02:51:39,729
maybe maybe it's too small maybe he didn't take it okay uh yeah I don't know you

965
02:51:44,450 --> 02:51:46,450
I love this costume

966
02:52:06,069 --> 02:52:15,940
okay uh should I offer him a bribe that's the only thing I haven't

967
02:52:16,260 --> 02:52:28,079
picked my pockets were empty I took the liberty of removing everything from

968
02:52:28,079 --> 02:52:33,040
your pocket I love this guy this was count your

969
02:52:33,040 --> 02:52:38,799
Chakonsky I knew I had failed when I looked into his eyes I was powerless

970
02:52:38,799 --> 02:52:45,559
to resist him all right I'm gonna try this one more

971
02:52:45,559 --> 02:52:53,940
time let me try one more time come on at least well I opened the green door and

972
02:52:53,940 --> 02:52:58,899
it was okay like I choose your adventure game there's a reason why you

973
02:52:58,899 --> 02:53:04,659
hold your finger on the previous page because open door on right guy kills

974
02:53:04,659 --> 02:53:08,079
you you know that's okay well fuck that I'm not doing that one and you

975
02:53:08,079 --> 02:53:11,200
keep your hand your finger on the tab you go back and you choose the

976
02:53:11,200 --> 02:53:33,920
right one you're cheating at books that's not cheating it's not cheating

977
02:53:33,920 --> 02:53:41,780
there's still so much stuff okay where do I where am I what am I doing wrong

978
02:53:42,500 --> 02:53:48,049
there's a lot more in this game that I really thought there was all right one more try

979
02:53:51,989 --> 02:54:06,799
holy water and then we gotta leave he wanted money all right but it was for a good cause

980
02:54:08,079 --> 02:54:15,989
okay it was nice to see you the okay don't send in the next client it's the guy that

981
02:54:15,989 --> 02:54:28,450
punches you so I'm gone the derhatchet institute was founded by

982
02:54:28,530 --> 02:54:44,930
under the mat of course naturally there was a key to the back of my neck okay now what

983
02:54:44,930 --> 02:54:52,000
over my shoulder is the girl explore the room everything is the girl I think the

984
02:54:52,000 --> 02:54:59,360
candlelit room should be okay the room was crawling with vermin but otherwise empty

985
02:54:59,360 --> 02:55:05,590
she follows oh god damn it she follows you both times she follows you in both scenarios I don't

986
02:55:05,670 --> 02:55:20,309
think you can avoid this wait explain I can't run I could sense that she was attracted to me

987
02:55:20,309 --> 02:55:31,879
what run tell her she has nice eyes what I don't understand what do you if I hadn't

988
02:55:31,879 --> 02:55:40,389
been so busy talking I might have noticed what why isn't a run really listening I can't believe

989
02:55:40,389 --> 02:55:43,909
there's not oh god damn it I could have avoided that all right there's one here's how

990
02:55:43,909 --> 02:55:49,750
you avoid that one you just have to go up the stairs and run because if you go to the

991
02:55:49,750 --> 02:55:55,510
candle it wrong I was out but someone or something had dragged me to a cellar below

992
02:55:55,510 --> 02:56:00,950
derhatchet holy water works but she follows you up the stairs as I struggled to clear my head

993
02:56:00,950 --> 02:56:03,590
I clicked on my flashlight and looked around

994
02:56:09,989 --> 02:56:14,000
all right these are yeah these all don't go look for trouble these all lead to the same

995
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:24,069
place anyways it was there in the cellar that I just okay so what's the correct thing with

996
02:56:24,069 --> 02:56:32,360
this guy don't turn around glance past him just just glance past him what if we don't attack

997
02:56:33,399 --> 02:56:38,920
he fell for it so I took the opportunity to bash him in the chops he fell for me looking the

998
02:56:38,920 --> 02:56:44,120
other way I never hit a man when he's down but I knew I should have made an exception when

999
02:56:44,120 --> 02:56:56,360
I felt his fingers on my throat can you avoid this guy oh flip over backwards right

1000
02:56:57,879 --> 02:57:02,280
I flipped him into his cold bin and ran into the darkness

1001
02:57:11,510 --> 02:57:21,270
Egyptology laundry look look for a stairway I don't think we did the stairway last time

1002
02:57:24,639 --> 02:57:32,129
I found myself ascending a steep here's the guy with the hat when a green ghoul

1003
02:57:32,129 --> 02:57:39,510
and a resin tuxedo made a dramatic entrance I wonder if there's a wrong option with this guy

1004
02:57:40,709 --> 02:57:49,409
proceed small I don't think it really matters let's just do small talk

1005
02:57:52,440 --> 02:57:57,989
I approached the zombie I don't want to go down I don't want to go down the to the

1006
02:57:58,790 --> 02:58:03,059
what if I say mind your own business that's the one option I did not do

1007
02:58:08,690 --> 02:58:14,610
we arrived on the first floor and I got off I could hear faint piano music coming from

1008
02:58:14,610 --> 02:58:24,530
somewhere all right where's the steak kitchen I don't I don't remember where the kitchen is

1009
02:58:24,530 --> 02:58:30,549
is it straight I'm getting so turned around like I don't even know what

1010
02:58:30,549 --> 02:58:35,350
any of these options really go the next room I came to had nothing in it okay here we go

1011
02:58:35,350 --> 02:58:40,149
there was an old freezer on one side and a wall full of potions on the other

1012
02:58:40,149 --> 02:59:04,600
so that we want the steak one we gotta give this guy money uh what about those potion bottles

1013
02:59:04,600 --> 02:59:10,680
hey man you don't want to be messing with those chemicals man they're bad for your karma

1014
02:59:12,709 --> 02:59:19,829
I read the labels extra strength potion instant steak pill anti-grav tablet

1015
02:59:19,829 --> 02:59:31,159
anti-gravity I feel like the steak is the is the correct option steak I wasn't hungry now

1016
02:59:31,159 --> 02:59:40,040
but an instant steak might come in handy later we'll stick to your ribs I gotta get up the

1017
02:59:40,040 --> 02:59:52,239
stair okay wait should I take the anti-gravity one too anti-grav tablets I noticed something

1018
02:59:52,239 --> 03:00:05,940
strange from the moment I opened the jar get some strength stop get the all right take the

1019
03:00:05,940 --> 03:00:10,500
instant strength potion and run taking the extra strength I gotta get out of here like a good

1020
03:00:10,500 --> 03:00:22,440
idea till I read the fine print oh god damn it we're dead we're dead ask take a deep breath

1021
03:00:22,440 --> 03:00:30,680
no run run run how do I get out run leave the fumes in the room no I'm trying to get out

1022
03:00:31,319 --> 03:00:44,389
and consequently I oh come on so I blacked out well how was how was I gonna know that

1023
03:00:44,389 --> 03:00:49,190
like it was there was a two joke options that I was at the end of my rope the anti-gravity

1024
03:00:49,190 --> 03:01:07,540
pills oh they fly up I was fit to be I did the situation none of this matters I was trying to

1025
03:01:07,540 --> 03:01:16,530
think of a diversion when I lost my footing and then how do I get up to the attic started

1026
03:01:16,530 --> 03:01:28,850
to slip away as the rope bit into my neck okay let's get them make good use of the rope

1027
03:01:28,850 --> 03:01:35,010
I told laughing boy was bound to be out of circulation for a while but he didn't

1028
03:01:35,010 --> 03:01:43,670
appreciate the gag okay so now from here look for a sign oh I don't think we clicked this

1029
03:01:43,670 --> 03:01:58,819
yet I'm pretty sure this is one I have not done look for a sign I did okay music I need

1030
03:01:58,819 --> 03:02:04,520
like a piece of paper that has like the blueprint of this house it's just like teleporting around

1031
03:02:04,520 --> 03:02:13,649
I was like my brain cannot remember where I am oh let's go do this the next room contained an

1032
03:02:13,649 --> 03:02:17,409
old writing desk under the derhatchet family we'll get points for getting rid of this on

1033
03:02:17,409 --> 03:02:30,360
the desk were many items of interest decipher the cryptic rune and then that makes him come

1034
03:02:30,360 --> 03:02:36,520
over and then we put it in the thing and we burn up the papers the candle lit itself

1035
03:02:36,600 --> 03:02:40,120
here we go and a funky phantom friar floated into the room

1036
03:02:48,209 --> 03:02:58,290
okay enjoy wine and candle light I extinguished the candle in a glass of the house vino

1037
03:02:58,290 --> 03:03:10,770
and the phantom friar gave up the ghost okay so from here we're still down I have the coins

1038
03:03:11,940 --> 03:03:18,420
I need to find my way up to the second floor find the elevator look for a way out okay

1039
03:03:19,059 --> 03:03:24,690
I'll get the golden split we did this last time which takes us outside

1040
03:03:25,409 --> 03:03:47,510
we can go to the elevator okay get in the elevator I want to go to the second floor

1041
03:03:50,020 --> 03:04:04,680
what floor please second floor so then from here where do I go from here

1042
03:04:04,680 --> 03:04:09,159
then remember second floor look dark and uninviting remember where to go from here

1043
03:04:09,719 --> 03:04:25,040
to get to the guy the kitchen all right yeah the kitchen already beat the last score the

1044
03:04:25,040 --> 03:04:34,040
room I next entered was obviously a library of some sort there was a door I don't remember

1045
03:04:34,040 --> 03:04:39,559
what timeline but most of the action was taking place in the kitchen on my right

1046
03:04:39,559 --> 03:04:45,159
where someone was practicing a bizarre form of here we go we're gonna go into the kitchen

1047
03:04:45,159 --> 03:04:54,610
get the points and towards the right I couldn't put my finger on it but there was something

1048
03:04:54,610 --> 03:05:04,979
was good eat holy shit it actually was good eats I think maybe it was her three-day beard

1049
03:05:08,120 --> 03:05:21,719
wow okay look in the fridge no way are you kidding me this game came out like how long ago

1050
03:05:21,719 --> 03:05:33,120
10 20 years ago inside the cupboard was a rose a clove of garlic and a couple of potatoes

1051
03:05:33,840 --> 03:05:38,799
so let me get this right my memory is fucking dog shit after this where do I want to go after

1052
03:05:38,799 --> 03:05:45,569
this I don't want to do the um I don't want to deal with the the wolf I reached in and took

1053
03:05:45,569 --> 03:06:00,370
the clove of garlic wolf is a death scenario okay sneak away sneak away quietly right I need

1054
03:06:00,370 --> 03:06:05,860
a drink I need the rose tiptoed out of the kitchen and left her right from here from here

1055
03:06:05,860 --> 03:06:10,340
where the fuck do I go from here a faint breeze carried a musty odor to my sensitive

1056
03:06:10,659 --> 03:06:21,319
I'm not going in there okay peek through go over to follow the breeze all the breeze I don't want

1057
03:06:21,319 --> 03:06:29,700
to go in the bathroom this room seems to be a laboratory I thought that was the closed door

1058
03:06:30,340 --> 03:06:36,260
I gotta get out of here right now realized what it was the room smelled like a wet dog

1059
03:06:38,790 --> 03:06:43,030
suddenly I realized that someone was coming up behind me I don't what I do I don't know

1060
03:06:43,030 --> 03:06:48,959
what to do what do I do what do I do turn around think quickly what the fuck am I

1061
03:06:48,959 --> 03:06:57,489
supposed to do think quickly thinking quickly I stepped into the shower and pulled the curtain

1062
03:06:57,489 --> 03:07:07,489
closed a hairy paw okay I don't think what should I do I peered around the corner you

1063
03:07:07,489 --> 03:07:13,329
have to flirt with the wolf she wolf busily primping herself for a night on the town

1064
03:07:14,290 --> 03:07:28,040
okay I'm gonna try um I give a you want me to show the flirt

1065
03:07:35,620 --> 03:07:43,030
and giggled like a school girl what then she started towards me are you kidding me

1066
03:07:43,030 --> 03:07:53,059
those eyes my life what do I do um um um puck her up puck her up puck her up puck her up

1067
03:07:53,459 --> 03:08:00,159
she's coming over I don't know she looked forward and planted a wet sloppy kiss on my lips

1068
03:08:00,879 --> 03:08:08,920
then stepped aside to let me pass got it okay now what smile and leave enter the room across the

1069
03:08:08,920 --> 03:08:13,959
say smile and leave the room all right bye bye smile I don't want to have to be followed

1070
03:08:13,959 --> 03:08:20,879
I stopped for a moment near the doorway okay we've not gone this far for good luck and now

1071
03:08:20,879 --> 03:08:26,479
from here I rounded the corner and very nearly bumped into a female vampire

1072
03:08:27,760 --> 03:08:36,629
she was starting to leave when I gave myself away shit okay well I have garlic confront her

1073
03:08:36,629 --> 03:08:41,190
hide um confront her I have garlic I have garlic I'm gonna do it I have garlic I'm gonna do it

1074
03:08:41,190 --> 03:08:48,360
I have garlic I'm gonna do it could see she was in no mood for a confrontation I have I have

1075
03:08:48,360 --> 03:08:58,079
garlic in my pocket what I have the stakes I have the guard why can't I attack I came to in an

1076
03:08:58,079 --> 03:09:04,420
attic someone or something was sitting across the attic from me I have garlic and I have the

1077
03:09:04,420 --> 03:09:13,219
steak pill and holy water decides to pay a visit to his host oh well have you enjoyed our

1078
03:09:13,219 --> 03:09:20,180
hospitality so many 500 points it's fine at least we seduced the werewolf it was difficult

1079
03:09:20,180 --> 03:09:30,200
not to listen his voice had a strong hypnotic effect god damn it well let's just get as many

1080
03:09:30,200 --> 03:09:38,120
I'm trying to get to 8000 points you don't know me I love this guy but I know you you have in

1081
03:09:38,120 --> 03:09:46,200
my inventory in consciousness was all the shit that vampires are weak against holy water see

1082
03:09:46,280 --> 03:09:54,200
steaks garlics I couldn't use any of them I picked out close to your heart that was my blood

1083
03:09:54,200 --> 03:09:57,879
he was sucking on I'm not gonna beat it you have to this is guys this game came out like

1084
03:09:57,879 --> 03:10:06,610
in 1984 1985 or something find something of value I don't have anything quickly I checked

1085
03:10:06,610 --> 03:10:19,719
my pockets what is it what's going on what's in my pocket throw a gold

1086
03:10:19,719 --> 03:10:32,979
coin kick in the groin what should I do I tried to attack but I can't do it into my eyes and I

1087
03:10:32,979 --> 03:10:42,760
knew I had failed I blacked out what would you pick the gold coins out why wouldn't you take

1088
03:10:42,760 --> 03:10:48,600
why wouldn't garlic be an option why wouldn't the steak pill a holy water he didn't take the

1089
03:10:48,600 --> 03:10:57,010
shit out of my pockets this time I have coin where I throw a coin at him why don't you give

1090
03:10:57,010 --> 03:11:02,819
him a coin because I want to try to kick the guy in the groin all right this game came out

1091
03:11:02,819 --> 03:11:07,059
in like 1992 are you serious you don't think it would have been like a comedy routine where

1092
03:11:07,059 --> 03:11:15,969
it's he goes like oh my oh my balls I was going for like the stupid like 90s comedy routine

1093
03:11:15,969 --> 03:11:29,200
this game came out in 2016 it wasn't yet but it wasn't filmed in 2016 it was filmed

1094
03:11:29,200 --> 03:11:47,760
in probably like 1990 shit all right well that was fun the game was made in 84 yeah come on well

1095
03:11:47,760 --> 03:12:17,559
now let's watch them well now we can see the music video wait did showing him dying what the

1096
03:12:17,559 --> 03:12:43,399
hell was that we didn't see any of this stuff oh we didn't get any of these options behind

1097
03:12:43,399 --> 03:12:56,399
the scenes yeah I think the skeleton guy's mouth is partially made from a baseball mitt

1098
03:12:56,479 --> 03:13:19,430
is this like a wizard like cantaloupe no not really I can't believe there's a wizard that

1099
03:13:19,430 --> 03:13:50,840
can cast fireball at you play it again oh you need to probably have the ace for that

1100
03:13:50,840 --> 03:13:54,930
the thing with these old games though is you have to be so weirdly specific about everything

1101
03:13:54,930 --> 03:14:34,159
to see some of this stuff some random lady we saw that plenty of times wait was that the real

1102
03:14:34,799 --> 03:14:53,319
ending villain that was fun actually in love with this game play more play again use a

1103
03:14:53,319 --> 03:14:58,159
walkthrough I could just use a walkthrough you look at the restoration of a 16 millimeter

1104
03:14:58,159 --> 03:15:02,959
film adaptation of the original interactive text adventure designed wait this is an

1105
03:15:02,959 --> 03:15:13,399
it's a text adventure that's why it feels like this uh remember the chance to create

1106
03:15:13,399 --> 03:15:19,409
a feature-length interactive film I wanted to read that vampires wanted restoration

1107
03:15:20,129 --> 03:15:25,920
that's really cool I did not back-to-back games that just never released

1108
03:15:26,559 --> 03:15:37,649
it's really interesting I love this shit I really do this kind of old-fashioned way to

1109
03:15:37,649 --> 03:15:46,049
have the sort of old 16 millimeter fmb games with all the weird goofy choices I love this shit

1110
03:15:50,979 --> 03:15:58,690
people still make them now but the people make interactive movies right now right

1111
03:15:59,329 --> 03:16:05,409
there's been a few of them one more playthrough all right one more time with I'm gonna get a

1112
03:16:05,409 --> 03:20:23,430
walkthrough I'm gonna go pee though I'll be right back boys and girls a little bit of an

1113
03:20:23,430 --> 03:20:32,500
issue here we have a little bit of a small problem here I don't think a walkthrough exists

1114
03:20:32,500 --> 03:20:44,959
for this game I don't see any there are no walkthroughs so that's bad make the walkthrough

1115
03:20:44,959 --> 03:21:01,280
did you even go to the bathroom I did I was promised to overwatch I don't I think you're

1116
03:21:01,280 --> 03:21:13,110
in the wrong place nobody's beaten this we'll help you you gotta be quick though you gotta

1117
03:21:13,110 --> 03:21:17,590
be really quick it's like two seconds it takes three seconds for the stream delay to kick in

1118
03:21:17,590 --> 03:21:31,680
for you guys to see what happened we're not gonna be able to do it I can't elongate that slow your

1119
03:21:31,680 --> 03:21:45,840
CPU down what if you alt tab does it actually let me test that let me just see if this works if I

1120
03:21:45,840 --> 03:21:59,510
like tab out will the game stop no it just keeps going yeah it keeps going wait a minute

1121
03:21:59,510 --> 03:22:05,510
wait a minute wait a minute what if I had known this shit this would have been so much

1122
03:22:05,510 --> 03:22:16,870
better guys oh my god damn it take a look at this get a good view get a good view

1123
03:22:16,870 --> 03:22:30,180
the timer doesn't do anything when it gets to zero it's just points I was panicking half the

1124
03:22:30,180 --> 03:22:46,549
time because I thought are you kidding me it's just puts your score up higher well you can help

1125
03:22:46,549 --> 03:22:54,610
let's figure this out together and this needs to be unanimous so the obvious play here

1126
03:22:54,610 --> 03:22:59,270
is I can't believe this I could have whatever we're gonna meet the gentleman

1127
03:23:02,959 --> 03:23:09,680
wanted money all right for a good cause thank you mr specter whatever your name is

1128
03:23:09,680 --> 03:23:19,670
tax deductible deductible they're not deductible okay so this just means a lot of points mid

1129
03:23:19,670 --> 03:23:27,170
points not I don't care if I get zero points I just want to see the end of the game okay

1130
03:23:27,170 --> 03:23:36,959
we do click maps click max is gonna take way too long all right the obvious thing here is

1131
03:23:36,959 --> 03:23:43,319
I have the holy water I don't want to send in do click maps I don't even I don't even

1132
03:23:43,319 --> 03:23:55,590
have it like installed we can do quick polls how long does the poll take just give us two

1133
03:23:55,590 --> 03:23:59,270
seconds to click hold all right well then give me a second I gotta like enable it again

1134
03:23:59,270 --> 03:24:06,239
oh this again I might I might not be able to do it no click map the shortest poll is one

1135
03:24:06,239 --> 03:24:13,600
minute that's much easier click okay to enable click maps have you guys click and me disable

1136
03:24:13,600 --> 03:24:29,270
it is like 45 seconds a b or c let's go the very obvious one I know how to get here it's b

1137
03:24:33,170 --> 03:24:41,059
I know how to get us into the room into the door the derhatchet institute was founded by a

1138
03:24:41,059 --> 03:24:52,049
noble prize-winning scientist locked is what okay fine we have not done we've only done look

1139
03:24:52,049 --> 03:25:03,559
under the mat what do you guys want to do let's open it up why not we'll do a full

1140
03:25:03,559 --> 03:25:15,479
chats choice run how does that sound and I look I can look at this as it's coming in

1141
03:25:16,200 --> 03:25:21,879
and yeah it's not gonna take 60 seconds look at 66 percent of the vote wants me to go a

1142
03:25:22,440 --> 03:25:28,600
so I could theoretically just once it once it becomes like a 50 to 60 percent majority

1143
03:25:28,600 --> 03:25:32,979
I'm just gonna go can you just close the poll like if you cancel the poll right now just

1144
03:25:32,979 --> 03:25:39,159
close it like I know that's 67 percent of voted for a and there's no way B is coming back

1145
03:25:39,159 --> 03:25:54,260
I can just do it right yeah let's go that works find another way inside as I walked around

1146
03:25:54,260 --> 03:26:00,899
the house I saw an open window high above me isn't that where the guy is I found a ladder

1147
03:26:00,899 --> 03:26:11,569
leaning next to another window okay I think that's where the guy is well there we go

1148
03:26:11,569 --> 03:26:18,760
perfect so after the poll is over it gives enough time after majority is seen to just

1149
03:26:18,760 --> 03:26:24,129
keep going that's perfect timing okay we can either climb the ladder look around explore

1150
03:26:24,129 --> 03:26:30,129
the extensive grounds or move ladder to access the open window I'm just going to tell you

1151
03:26:30,389 --> 03:26:35,110
I am under the impression here that I think that's the um the Count Dooku guy

1152
03:26:35,110 --> 03:26:44,469
uh the gravest guy is up there this is extraordinarily unanimous looks like we're

1153
03:26:44,469 --> 03:26:58,879
going to see I moved the ladder and started I hope it's him I was halfway through the window

1154
03:26:58,879 --> 03:27:04,159
looking at the ground below when I was struck from above by what felt like a Louisville slugger

1155
03:27:05,459 --> 03:27:17,319
the gorilla hovering above me was a bat from the big leagues push its face in swing for

1156
03:27:17,319 --> 03:27:26,049
the fences or maintain a safe distance I doubt any of these work if I'm going to be honest with

1157
03:27:26,049 --> 03:27:40,559
you a bat from the big leagues well B makes sense because B is part of the pun right

1158
03:27:40,559 --> 03:27:55,760
it's waiting for the fences a big bat from the big leagues all right we'll go and be

1159
03:27:55,760 --> 03:28:03,110
it's unanimous waiting for the fence I grabbed the bat with both hands and swung

1160
03:28:03,110 --> 03:28:08,309
away from me to say it looked angry would be a gross understatement that definitely hurt

1161
03:28:08,309 --> 03:28:21,879
the actor okay snare the bat with the rope climb up to the rafters or use the rope to escape

1162
03:28:30,879 --> 03:28:40,200
snare the bat with the rope that's in that it's 80 percent of the votes so far

1163
03:28:40,200 --> 03:28:50,290
yeah okay snare the bat I grabbed the rope and a trap door opened as we're running fell

1164
03:28:50,290 --> 03:28:56,690
for what seemed to be a long long time they hit the ground hard fortunately I broke my

1165
03:28:56,770 --> 03:29:03,000
fall on something soft well well what do you think you're doing mother doesn't like anybody

1166
03:29:03,000 --> 03:29:12,149
playing in our laundry do your mom that's right stay out of my laundry why did he change

1167
03:29:12,149 --> 03:29:28,290
his voice halfway through this guy was obviously a psycho this guy's a psycho uh

1168
03:29:30,229 --> 03:29:39,350
why does it sound like bobcat gault wait I mean I had to like make sounds and make voices

1169
03:29:39,350 --> 03:29:45,989
and stuff like that it sounds like me you guys say this to me all right give the psycho

1170
03:29:45,989 --> 03:29:56,500
a closer look go find the butler give mama a friendly smile well I think this is the death

1171
03:29:56,500 --> 03:30:01,799
one but we have to click it because that's what you guys want to do give mama a friendly smile

1172
03:30:09,729 --> 03:30:35,479
yet within striking distance casually gain his confidence or go find the butler

1173
03:30:35,479 --> 03:30:39,239
I'm convinced that you made this game and this is some kind of prank stream I wish I

1174
03:30:39,239 --> 03:30:59,840
did I wish I made this game all right we're going to be I moved cautiously towards mama's

1175
03:31:00,159 --> 03:31:11,729
watch it right okay you guys got that double wrong that's double wrong he flattened your nose

1176
03:31:11,729 --> 03:31:21,350
I don't know how long I was out but someone or something had dragged me to a cellar below

1177
03:31:21,350 --> 03:31:29,110
der hatchet manor as I struggled to clear my head I clicked on my flashlight and looked

1178
03:31:29,110 --> 03:31:35,190
around any fool could see that the place had more than its share of dingbats and I was

1179
03:31:35,190 --> 03:31:47,430
no exception FMV game you know how badly I've okay here's the problem there's I have to be

1180
03:31:47,430 --> 03:31:53,590
careful for like shotgun blasting out a bunch of ideas that I think are really fun because

1181
03:31:54,149 --> 03:32:02,629
I have to focus on only a few things at a time make no mistake about it I would love

1182
03:32:02,629 --> 03:32:12,000
nothing more than to put hundreds and hundreds of hours of time and any amount of money

1183
03:32:12,079 --> 03:32:19,159
doesn't matter how much it would cost to make an FMV game that's like this but holy shit that

1184
03:32:19,159 --> 03:32:27,940
is like a monumental undertaking and there's no way I'm going to be able to do it there's only

1185
03:32:27,940 --> 03:32:35,430
so many things that can be in the tank you can't load up too much luggage in your car to the

1186
03:32:35,430 --> 03:32:41,350
point where your car is touching the ground because it won't drive yeah I can't weigh the

1187
03:32:41,350 --> 03:32:52,549
car down with 500 cinder blocks make that one the last bit before retirement all right

1188
03:32:52,549 --> 03:33:00,770
explore the seller it was there in the cellar that I discovered the little man with the evil

1189
03:33:00,770 --> 03:33:05,569
grin I've actually talked about it before with people in the community about like things that

1190
03:33:05,569 --> 03:33:11,250
I've wanted to do but it's just I can't I get it's too much to think about too much to do

1191
03:33:30,389 --> 03:33:33,110
all right I mean we already know how this one plays out I probably just do this on my

1192
03:33:37,959 --> 03:33:45,780
own it's don't turn around and then we flip them he fell for it so I took the opportunity

1193
03:33:45,780 --> 03:33:52,979
to bash him in the chops I never hit a man when he's down but I knew I should have made

1194
03:33:52,979 --> 03:33:59,139
an exception when I felt his fingers on my throat how fucking awesome how fun would that be

1195
03:34:02,659 --> 03:34:11,170
man imagine making a full FMV game and we just do it when you guys play it like I don't

1196
03:34:11,170 --> 03:34:25,700
even play it you guys pick like this oh god damn it that would be fun yeah do it I don't tell me

1197
03:34:25,700 --> 03:34:35,059
to do these things because I will fuck up every other project just give me a little bit more

1198
03:34:35,059 --> 03:34:42,420
time I have a lot more things to talk about just a little bit more time um I want to do

1199
03:34:42,420 --> 03:34:49,280
so many of these things a little bit more time all right what are we doing all right

1200
03:34:49,280 --> 03:34:56,760
well Chad is deciding to lose another heart so uh we're going to tickle him he just tightened

1201
03:34:56,760 --> 03:35:12,870
his grip and laughed while you died I woke up with the feeling that I was at the end of my

1202
03:35:12,870 --> 03:35:21,729
rope it didn't work realized that I was you lost a heart the situation was bad and my life

1203
03:35:21,729 --> 03:35:27,989
hung in the balance but this was no time for reflection just make an unfinished FMV project and

1204
03:35:27,989 --> 03:35:35,010
have somebody else need to finish it in 30 years that's really funny well it would have

1205
03:35:35,010 --> 03:35:39,190
to be shot in 16 millimeter that's one of the things I'm going to make it really incredibly

1206
03:35:39,190 --> 03:35:46,770
incredibly clear if I'm if I were to do this it's being shot in 16 millimeter I don't care

1207
03:35:46,770 --> 03:36:02,500
how expensive it is this needs to be led that way it's going to be like two million dollars

1208
03:36:02,500 --> 03:36:12,149
fuck it I don't think it's gonna cost that much do 16 millimeter and then get it restored

1209
03:36:13,110 --> 03:36:23,760
wow now that's a big brain play that's a big brain play where'd you put somebody say cringe

1210
03:36:23,760 --> 03:36:28,000
all right uh we all we know this is easy all these are the same I was trying to think

1211
03:36:28,000 --> 03:36:38,680
of a diversion when I lost my footing the control started to slip away as the rope bit

1212
03:36:38,680 --> 03:36:47,250
into my neck have us pay for it do like a pay-per-view stream when I got up I saw that

1213
03:36:47,250 --> 03:36:55,219
the pipe had made quite an impression on laughing boy I wouldn't want to do okay here's what I

1214
03:36:55,219 --> 03:37:02,040
wouldn't want to do I wouldn't want to make it so people couldn't watch it even if that okay

1215
03:37:02,040 --> 03:37:05,639
let's say that this whole project if it was ever if it was ever done remember this is not

1216
03:37:05,639 --> 03:37:12,129
me saying it's happening I'm just saying that's I'm interested if it was oh here's an idea

1217
03:37:12,129 --> 03:37:16,959
we'll make the whole thing and then the stream will be you pay for the stream like a

1218
03:37:16,959 --> 03:37:23,239
pay-per-view stream no I want as many people to experience that as humanly possible

1219
03:37:25,379 --> 03:37:32,290
maybe do paid physical copies yeah I honestly I would not give a shit at all I mean obviously

1220
03:37:32,290 --> 03:37:37,620
I don't want to like lose like millions of dollars like that would be fucking devastating

1221
03:37:37,620 --> 03:37:43,799
I don't have millions of dollars that would be pretty bad maybe there's a way maybe

1222
03:37:43,799 --> 03:37:53,479
maybe I'll find a way all right what do you guys want to make yeah of course I told

1223
03:37:53,479 --> 03:37:58,840
laughing boy he was bound to be out of circulation for a while but he didn't

1224
03:37:59,799 --> 03:38:11,829
losing millions is really funny though no not really okay well all right this is where

1225
03:38:11,829 --> 03:38:25,280
it all goes completely off the rails what about getting it sponsored

1226
03:38:26,500 --> 03:38:37,590
yeah you don't know you're gonna get the sign it would need to be done with actors

1227
03:38:38,389 --> 03:38:57,920
shot on film I wanted to be old where we going I would make yourself an actor no I

1228
03:38:57,920 --> 03:39:01,440
would know I don't be the only actor I would be I would be in it for like 10 seconds

1229
03:39:04,440 --> 03:39:16,819
I'd be like the the old prospector that you run into like in a hallway somewhere

1230
03:39:16,819 --> 03:39:19,940
this is also pretty this is very unanimous look for some artifacts

1231
03:39:22,709 --> 03:39:27,670
the next room contained an old writing desk under the derhatchet family crest

1232
03:39:27,670 --> 03:39:39,959
on the desk were many items of interest did you get streamers to be actors no I don't

1233
03:39:39,959 --> 03:39:45,430
think so I don't want anyone I feel like okay I want them to be unknown I don't want

1234
03:39:45,430 --> 03:39:50,360
anyone to know who they are I wanted to be actors I wanted to be I'd like to be like

1235
03:39:51,239 --> 03:39:59,190
because here's the thing stuff like that would be really funny but let's just say it was like

1236
03:39:59,190 --> 03:40:06,790
streamer x it's no it's it's like streamer x playing character right it's not that's the

1237
03:40:06,790 --> 03:40:13,219
that's a monster on the screen so if I would ever do exactly the same reason why I said I

1238
03:40:13,219 --> 03:40:18,129
don't even want to be in it either like I would want to be in it for like 10 seconds

1239
03:40:18,129 --> 03:40:22,290
as like an easter egg I don't want to be in this I want to hire I want to like direct

1240
03:40:22,290 --> 03:40:28,069
actors right because then it's just oh look it's germa as this character you know I'm

1241
03:40:28,069 --> 03:40:35,959
saying so no it would be all just actors that we would be hiring and I'm talking like this is

1242
03:40:35,959 --> 03:40:46,479
happening soon but it's not if it did happen it would be like that all right uh taste the wine

1243
03:40:47,280 --> 03:40:52,850
we already know how to do this one we already know how to do this one why are you doing

1244
03:40:52,850 --> 03:41:03,170
this as I reached forward the candle lit itself and as if by magic a monk appeared

1245
03:41:03,170 --> 03:41:23,670
well this is a different option now play more of these games if you're a relatively new viewer

1246
03:41:23,670 --> 03:41:29,829
fold motion video games I've played almost all of them over the last five years or so

1247
03:41:29,829 --> 03:41:36,549
there actually aren't very many left that I haven't played some of the new ones I haven't

1248
03:41:36,549 --> 03:41:44,600
played the ones that have come out in the last year or two and we're going to be

1249
03:41:44,600 --> 03:41:50,120
dunk the flame in the wine oh yeah okay wish the candle and a glass of the house vino

1250
03:41:50,120 --> 03:41:58,399
and the phantom friar gave up the ghost at least the ones that looked like we'd have a good time

1251
03:41:58,399 --> 03:42:04,079
playing them right some fmv games that are very much meant to be taken very seriously

1252
03:42:05,139 --> 03:42:08,979
and it's not like oh my god look at how funny that was look at how bizarre of a scenario

1253
03:42:08,979 --> 03:42:12,739
that was it's just actors doing things in front of a camera so it's supposed to be

1254
03:42:12,739 --> 03:42:16,500
taken seriously and not like oh let's have a fun time and laugh at this

1255
03:42:16,500 --> 03:42:36,180
all right pocket the gold and split I think that's what it's going to be it is you guys

1256
03:42:36,180 --> 03:42:54,520
cannot make another mistake okay you want to go I don't want to say anything because it's

1257
03:42:54,520 --> 03:43:02,709
kind of close when is the baseball stream baseball stream is going to be at some point

1258
03:43:02,709 --> 03:43:11,680
in the first quarter or second quarter of next year somewhere when baseball is played

1259
03:43:11,680 --> 03:43:15,780
it was a theory that we might be able to get it done this year but it's not going

1260
03:43:15,780 --> 03:43:28,520
to happen too cold but that I refuse to not do that stream and what about grotto beasts

1261
03:43:28,520 --> 03:43:36,799
grotto beast actually let's do this right now I want to shout this out so grotto beasts I

1262
03:43:36,799 --> 03:43:42,239
can't give you a time or a date for that but I really really want you to be able to have

1263
03:43:42,239 --> 03:43:52,950
that stuff in your hands the physical cards in your hands by the latest quarter one of this

1264
03:43:52,950 --> 03:43:58,520
coming year I'm giving a huge window for that because it's very very possible that's

1265
03:44:01,319 --> 03:44:10,370
but I don't want to rush people on the work that they're doing so if you get it at some

1266
03:44:10,370 --> 03:44:16,209
point at the end of this year or January maybe you do but I'm not going to tell you that

1267
03:44:16,209 --> 03:44:20,129
because I don't want to put on just a dumb amount of pressure on people to have to get

1268
03:44:20,129 --> 03:44:25,510
stuff done that's I don't know I do not want to do that so whenever it's done

1269
03:44:25,510 --> 03:44:31,540
and whenever it's like okay it's ready to go and with that let's go ahead and talk about

1270
03:44:31,540 --> 03:44:44,639
this so the grotto beasts team as a twitter and they post various updates I actually just

1271
03:44:44,639 --> 03:44:57,989
retweeted them on Halloween here's the official grotto beasts twitter account let me put it in

1272
03:44:57,989 --> 03:45:04,200
the chat go give it a follow if you want to know more about grotto beast coming up

1273
03:45:04,200 --> 03:45:18,000
they post all the time all the various artists and here you go here is the official twitter of

1274
03:45:18,000 --> 03:45:29,190
the grotto beasts trading card game I was holding off on talking about this until it

1275
03:45:29,190 --> 03:45:39,760
was clear that we had sort of like an end goal of soon grotto beast nfts these are not nfts

1276
03:45:39,760 --> 03:45:46,389
but not there's not going to be an nft there won't be any grotto beast nfts this is you're

1277
03:45:46,389 --> 03:45:50,049
going to be able to hold these in your hand well not you get that it's a you're going to

1278
03:45:50,049 --> 03:45:59,729
be a whole it's cards you will be able to purchase and open for yourself packs of grotto

1279
03:45:59,729 --> 03:46:09,809
beasts by the way let's make this very clear too if you think that this was just going to

1280
03:46:09,889 --> 03:46:17,780
be a repackaged thing that I opened on the stream you are so wrong there's going to be

1281
03:46:18,790 --> 03:46:28,149
an astronomical more amount of cards and it's going to have a playable game behind it as well

1282
03:46:28,149 --> 03:46:36,079
you're actually going to be able to play this with people it's a real game have a game

1283
03:46:36,079 --> 03:46:43,700
designer and I hope you like it when it comes out because there's other stuff that I haven't

1284
03:46:43,700 --> 03:46:51,190
talked about yet with it too but you know what yeah fuck it let's just talk about it why

1285
03:46:51,190 --> 03:47:06,979
not hey I I'm the goddamn CEO okay um should I hold off on some stuff so the grotto beasts

1286
03:47:06,979 --> 03:47:16,020
card game is going to end up being a pretty significant uh when people talk about like

1287
03:47:16,020 --> 03:47:20,309
merch right oh what what should you do for merch should you do a t-shirt I could do

1288
03:47:20,309 --> 03:47:23,590
another t-shirt oh maybe I'll do a t-shirt maybe I'll do something else or maybe I'll

1289
03:47:23,590 --> 03:47:30,680
do like a toy or something in the grotto beast card game is going to be not just

1290
03:47:30,680 --> 03:47:40,479
grotto beasts it's not just going to be grotto beasts it's going to be tons and tons of this

1291
03:47:40,479 --> 03:47:53,940
channel's references characters it's going to be a gigantic crossover so it's not just simply

1292
03:47:53,940 --> 03:47:58,690
the grotto beasts there's potentially lots of other things too that you'll be able to have

1293
03:47:58,690 --> 03:48:10,690
and collect it's the biggest crossover event ever and it's two things that were created

1294
03:48:11,170 --> 03:48:18,079
on this same channel in this same community it's not even a crossover event it's the same goddamn

1295
03:48:18,079 --> 03:48:29,600
channel um so I've been pretty tight-lipped about this because I don't I didn't want to

1296
03:48:29,600 --> 03:48:34,229
like hype this up until I knew that it was going to start to become a thing so it's a

1297
03:48:34,229 --> 03:48:43,879
game you can actually play it you don't even have to he's losing viewers no stay don't please

1300
03:49:20,579 --> 03:49:27,239
just know that it's gonna have a lot of cards it's gonna be I don't want to talk too much

I have no answer for that time I don't I currently do not have an answer for this time

1314
03:51:43,409 --> 03:51:48,479
I'm I think so I just can't give you an answer I don't know I do not have an answer

1315
03:51:48,479 --> 03:51:54,120
for this time and my phone just blew up uh I've got eight unread notifications on my phone

1316
03:51:55,620 --> 03:52:03,940
uh I see a stop sign emoji a hundred times okay I probably should um let's go ahead and

1317
03:52:03,940 --> 03:52:23,200
play the game what did you guys pick it was a I don't remember it I can't it was b all

1318
03:52:23,200 --> 03:52:37,430
right b let's go on the steps above me a green ghoul gestured gracefully I'm really really

1319
03:52:37,430 --> 03:52:41,190
excited for not just the fact that the grotto beast are really awesome but it's going to

1320
03:52:41,190 --> 03:52:47,280
be this interesting kind of mix of like a ton of references to this the last decade plus

1321
03:52:48,149 --> 03:53:06,120
of this channel and community it's a really interesting way I was hopeful to do merch and

1322
03:53:06,200 --> 03:53:16,709
we're going a proceed boldly I approached the zombie reluctantly and asked him who his tailor

1323
03:53:16,709 --> 03:53:27,079
was his response was to push him backwards into a rickety old freight elevator yeah you said

1324
03:53:37,399 --> 03:53:41,639
you end up going to do the germa joke plus two minus two futures market with channel

1325
03:53:41,639 --> 03:53:52,290
points that seems like a fun idea yeah I did but that's the problem this is why I get into

1326
03:53:52,290 --> 03:54:00,209
trouble I get in a lot of trouble because we okay I tell I tell you guys about four or five

1327
03:54:00,209 --> 03:54:06,600
different things that sound really interesting don't they but in reality only one or two of

1328
03:54:06,600 --> 03:54:13,190
those things can possibly be worked on so what ends up happening is you are like oh my god

1329
03:54:14,149 --> 03:54:18,469
he talked about like four or five different cool things going on when in reality one of these

1330
03:54:18,469 --> 03:54:23,159
things is actually going to work these are all things that I really want to do every time I

1331
03:54:23,159 --> 03:54:31,040
talk it's things that I really want to do but here's the thing right since the dollhouse stream

1332
03:54:33,350 --> 03:54:43,059
there's been some potential here to do more possibly maybe hopefully maybe find more people

1333
03:54:43,059 --> 03:54:48,340
that are willing to get on board and help us pay for projects and help us do things

1334
03:54:50,129 --> 03:54:56,209
some of these things are possible now because the dollhouse happened and the dollhouse was a

1335
03:54:56,209 --> 03:55:01,959
really really fun time so I can't tell you exactly what's going to happen because I still

1336
03:55:01,959 --> 03:55:08,600
don't even know but if some of these doors are starting to open a little bit more with

1337
03:55:08,600 --> 03:55:15,250
like okay now people are aware that I want to do big projects and I need capital and I need

1338
03:55:15,250 --> 03:55:20,610
people and I need um more crew members and stuff right like this is all stuff that's

1339
03:55:21,569 --> 03:55:28,610
knowledgeable to a lot of people now so if I can get some of these things to help make

1340
03:55:28,610 --> 03:55:41,000
these projects come faster that's what I'm gonna do networking Andy well you bet your ass that

1341
03:55:41,000 --> 03:55:50,280
I want to try to make some of these things a reality right and if they do become a reality

1342
03:55:50,280 --> 03:55:54,879
that's what makes me happy I don't care about anything else I really don't I don't give a

1343
03:55:54,879 --> 03:56:00,000
shit about anything else I could not make a single dollar from any of the projects

1344
03:56:00,000 --> 03:56:06,049
none of them zero I would not give a flying fuck at all I wouldn't care at all I don't care

1345
03:56:06,049 --> 03:56:11,799
if they if the projects can be paid for and I don't have to worry about it then fucking

1346
03:56:11,799 --> 03:56:21,760
perfect that's exactly what I want I don't care he's lying by the way I'm not I swear

1347
03:56:21,760 --> 03:56:32,930
I promise you I don't care you've seen okay you've seen the leak I don't even need to

1348
03:56:32,930 --> 03:56:39,569
tell you that like we've made jokes about it before do I really need to make a shitload of money

1349
03:56:39,569 --> 03:56:59,909
on each project because I'm I have to no I don't care I'm for 98 yeah I'm not a liar says the

1350
03:56:59,909 --> 03:57:08,370
lie yeah all right I am a liar I'm a liar but not in not on important stuff like this I'm not

1351
03:57:08,370 --> 03:57:14,850
trying to make a bunch of money I'm trying to have things be paid for right that I'm

1352
03:57:14,850 --> 03:57:20,100
I hear about and sometimes people will hear about some of the how much some of this

1353
03:57:20,100 --> 03:57:28,149
these projects costed right holy shit it was that much money yeah I I it kind of sometimes

1354
03:57:28,149 --> 03:57:34,790
it has to be but don't get do not give me any money I'm seeing people give money don't do that

1355
03:57:34,790 --> 03:57:39,879
stop giving me money right now I demand it somebody's give me a hundred dollars

1356
03:57:39,879 --> 03:57:46,209
thank you for the do not do not give me any money stop that immediately I command it I

1357
03:57:47,170 --> 03:58:01,059
demand it it ends at once where we going stop reverse engineer Andy I'm just saying all right

1358
03:58:01,059 --> 03:58:08,680
just know in the future whatever projects we do I'm just I'm glad that they were able to happen

1359
03:58:08,680 --> 03:58:15,059
that's it just think about this thing this is like the kind of shit that I've wanted to do

1360
03:58:15,059 --> 03:58:24,760
since I was like fucking 12 right I cannot even begin to tell you guys just how how it

1361
03:58:24,760 --> 03:58:32,709
feels to like something that I wanted to do when I was 11 you are 12 like I am I'm really

1362
03:58:32,709 --> 03:58:38,399
I'm living every single one of my fantasies from when I was a kid it's unbelievable to me

1363
03:58:38,399 --> 03:58:43,940
and the fact that I'm able just to do that alone just just by itself is worth more than

1364
03:58:43,940 --> 03:58:52,790
anything anything so the fact that I can sit here and talk like this is already enough

1365
03:58:52,790 --> 03:59:12,979
just want to be clear Jesus fucking Christ just play the game already I just I just had a

1366

1375
04:00:35,190 --> 04:00:45,569
walk straight this I don't think I've done this before the next room I came to had nothing

1376
04:00:45,569 --> 04:00:51,649
in it there was an old freezer on one side and a wall full of potions on the other

1377
04:00:51,649 --> 04:01:15,909
just as I started to examine them I heard a scream open the freezers the correct play

1378
04:01:15,909 --> 04:01:28,200
we've all seen it like five times already although there's opening the freezer stop

1379
04:01:28,200 --> 04:01:41,600
whatever the laughing screaming person coming in the room I think Coolsville sucks just open

1380
04:01:41,600 --> 04:02:00,370
the freezer ignoring the fumes I opened the freezer I love this guy uh can I just do this

1381
04:02:00,370 --> 04:02:21,489
on my own because I know how to get there please do okay hey man you don't want to be

1382
04:02:21,489 --> 04:02:30,420
messing with those chemicals man they're bad for your karma I read the labels extra strength

1383
04:02:30,420 --> 04:02:43,809
potion instant steak pill anti-grav tablets okay uh so it's the take the steak leave

1384
04:02:44,770 --> 04:02:55,719
I wasn't hungry now but an instant steak might come in handy later where's your choice

1385
04:02:55,719 --> 04:03:04,549
that's what everybody was gonna pick all right this is it's a and then you leave these are

1386
04:03:04,549 --> 04:03:29,569
both this is gonna kill us so don't don't be don't be stupid about this thank you hey man

1387
04:03:29,569 --> 04:03:35,170
like I don't mean to be rude you know but like there's something in here that smells

1388
04:03:35,250 --> 04:03:39,649
almost worse than I do you know he did have a point

1389
04:03:48,850 --> 04:04:05,729
that noise at the end uh yeah we gotta get out of this room it's your one year

1390
04:04:05,729 --> 04:04:28,790
anniversary with the sus face I want a divorce I gave him five dollars and left all right

1391
04:04:28,790 --> 04:04:34,159
this is a tough call because I don't remember exactly which one of these means you get

1392
04:04:34,159 --> 04:04:56,000
grabbed but how do you feel about the rats becoming extremely popular and tiktok

1393
04:04:56,000 --> 04:05:01,829
sorry say that again say that one more time I didn't hear that that well say that again

1394
04:05:01,829 --> 04:05:13,079
I want you to say that again the rats are incredibly popular on tiktok the rats are

1395
04:05:13,079 --> 04:05:18,149
huge on tiktok excuse I'm sorry I'm leaning with my ear say that one more time what did

1396
04:05:18,149 --> 04:05:27,350
we talk about like a few weeks ago what that I I am huge on tiktok and I'm not even there

1397
04:05:27,350 --> 04:05:32,819
so I'm excuse me I'm just trying to understand why everyone was saying that

1398
04:05:32,819 --> 04:05:50,479
that was not accurate the rats are also huge on Facebook all right let's search the room the

1399
04:05:50,479 --> 04:05:59,399
rats are popular not you bozo as I ran into the next room I heard the scream

1400
04:05:59,399 --> 04:06:13,600
again I am the rats the rats are nothing without me should I make a tiktok video of

1401
04:06:13,600 --> 04:06:18,340
doing the rat song but make sure I'm doing it really poorly and I'd be pretty relatively

1402
04:06:18,340 --> 04:06:23,219
unknown on tiktok would people like hate me for it would be like oh that was terrible

1403
04:06:23,219 --> 04:06:28,360
nice try my video is way better on the tick on the rats meme it's like I'm I'm the one

1404
04:06:28,360 --> 04:06:39,120
who made it talking you talking to the guy that made it up keep moving forward why you're

1405
04:06:39,120 --> 04:06:47,860
not actually gonna do this are you I ran through the door and found myself near the elevator

1406
04:06:47,860 --> 04:06:53,780
oh I thought you fall I pushed the button and waited there was a green door to my left

1407
04:06:53,780 --> 04:06:59,590
and a stairway to my right okay I know for a fact that we don't do the green door

1408
04:06:59,590 --> 04:07:20,879
this is a really important decision but I'm just kidding I scramble up the stairs

1409
04:07:21,440 --> 04:07:38,629
is it time to release release release is it time to release the third rat song

1410
04:07:38,629 --> 04:07:53,969
I wonder if we're gonna get to the end at the top of the stairs I saw an ugly dwarf

1411
04:08:00,610 --> 04:08:16,639
private eye versus private eye gory how tall am I okay show them your license take evasive

1412
04:08:16,639 --> 04:08:34,819
action and put down that shovel take evasive action when he moved I jumped over the railing

1413
04:08:35,860 --> 04:08:40,340
it was a long way to the first floor and laughing boy was no help at all

1414
04:08:44,309 --> 04:08:53,860
that would hurt so bad holy shit that was painful looking I think you guys are in some

1415
04:08:53,860 --> 04:09:04,149
trouble here grab his shirt and pull punch with your stronger hand or let go of the

1416
04:09:04,149 --> 04:09:13,670
railing grab his shirt and pull is winning by a way too much I grabbed his shirt and he flipped

1417
04:09:13,670 --> 04:09:33,190
over the railing symbol crash the second floor looked dark and uninviting okay where we go I

1418
04:09:33,190 --> 04:09:40,920
told my friend who used to work with a company that helped with this game and he thought that

1419
04:09:40,920 --> 04:09:47,409
it was crazy that you were playing it I mean it's we're having a great time the last one

1420
04:09:47,409 --> 04:09:57,909
too I applaud the companies that actually tried to restore this stuff this is awesome

1421
04:09:57,909 --> 04:10:09,110
I'm having a lot of fun ask your friend how to beat the game all right we're going I don't know

1422
04:10:09,110 --> 04:10:21,649
it's 5142 a and c if it were me I would probably pick the one that we didn't do yet

1423
04:10:21,649 --> 04:10:25,649
which is probably whatever medical records so and that's winning right now so that's what

1424
04:10:25,649 --> 04:10:40,229
I'm gonna pick the room I next entered was obviously a library of some sort well kitchen

1425
04:10:40,229 --> 04:10:45,909
regardless I'm gonna get the garlic there was a door to my left another dead ahead

1426
04:10:45,909 --> 04:10:50,950
but most of the action was taking place in the kitchen on my right where someone was

1427
04:10:50,950 --> 04:11:02,770
practicing a bizarre form of culinary preparation but we don't necessarily have to do the kitchen

1428
04:11:02,770 --> 04:11:23,250
but the garlic seems pretty important huh yes the library kitchen I couldn't put my finger

1429
04:11:23,250 --> 04:11:28,360
on it but there was something odd about the woman in the kitchen if you're hungry get it

1430
04:11:29,000 --> 04:11:38,159
it's really cold in this room I think you see the breath coming out do you see that do you see just

1431
04:11:38,159 --> 04:11:51,670
how cold it is in there I feel bad for the actor uh yeah we look in the we're gonna look

1432
04:11:51,670 --> 04:12:14,530
in the fridge of course uh find other edibles we've gotten this right plenty of times

1433
04:12:14,530 --> 04:12:19,799
make the fmv game and make sure there's no references to you in it no there won't be

1434
04:12:19,799 --> 04:12:26,180
it would be it would be I mean well there'd be you'd probably know I made it somehow but

1435
04:12:26,420 --> 04:12:32,450
this would not be a like germa 985 fmv experience it'd be like an old western

1436
04:12:32,450 --> 04:12:43,590
game or something like an old horror game inside the cupboard was a rose a clove of garlic

1437
04:12:43,590 --> 04:13:05,959
and a couple of potatoes what are we doing don't tell us you made it and just play it one day

1438
04:13:05,959 --> 04:13:11,090
well I think it would be really fun if the first experience ever with the game

1439
04:13:11,090 --> 04:13:17,079
was on the stream and you guys are doing this maybe we'll build like an extension or

1440
04:13:17,079 --> 04:13:23,170
something I have like some kind of use of an extension for you guys to do it easier

1441
04:13:23,170 --> 04:13:31,090
so you guys will get the first experience of the game and then I reached in and took

1442
04:13:31,090 --> 04:13:39,639
the clove of god a week later or something it goes on steam or whatever stop giving him

1443
04:13:39,639 --> 04:13:57,399
the idea he only cares about money I care about money I don't only care about money

1444
04:13:57,399 --> 04:14:08,920
money's somewhere on the list somewhere take the potato I feel like I'm gonna get hurt

1445
04:14:08,920 --> 04:14:23,000
I you guys really I think A is you took too much die and we get stabbed

1446
04:14:23,079 --> 04:14:36,959
this is a gg I think yeah all right well

1447
04:14:44,760 --> 04:14:57,639
what the hell I came to here I am it's me I took all the things

1448
04:14:58,680 --> 04:15:06,600
was sitting across the attic from me at long last the detective decides to pay a bit

1449
04:15:06,600 --> 04:15:16,000
hypnotic effect this doesn't matter oh I feel like we've met before

1450
04:15:18,659 --> 04:15:25,860
you don't know me but I know you that's my favorite shot of the whole thing when he's

1451
04:15:25,860 --> 04:15:37,440
kind of leaned over you all said A anyways I want this guy it's something I picked out

1452
04:15:37,440 --> 04:15:49,270
close to your heart that was my blood he was sucking on this character okay this is

1453
04:15:49,270 --> 04:16:11,840
actually important I want that exact character in another game find something of value I should

1454
04:16:11,840 --> 04:16:31,110
have the coins quickly I checked my pockets okay throw a gold coin that's the only option

1455
04:16:31,110 --> 04:16:41,750
that probably results in something different that's a different video clip let's try it

1456
04:16:41,750 --> 04:16:49,250
I threw it in his mouth expecting him to choke to death what but instead

1457
04:16:50,790 --> 04:16:59,479
very tasty when I looked in his eyes I knew I had failed I was powerless to resist him

1458
04:17:02,840 --> 04:17:22,629
it was so stupid that sucked that sucked it was a great throw but Jesus okay you guys

1459
04:17:22,709 --> 04:17:33,959
want one more chance at this I'm gonna give you one more chance but let's get to the end

1460
04:17:33,959 --> 04:17:48,309
I know you can do it collectively I know you can is there another FMV I have this I have one more

1461
04:17:48,309 --> 04:17:53,190
that's ready for right now but it's new and I don't know I'm not sure if I want to do it

1462
04:17:53,190 --> 04:18:07,959
right now it looks like it might be long depends on how long it is is it the battle

1463
04:18:07,959 --> 04:18:24,389
royale one omega lol it is why are you saying that omega lol omega lol omega lol no

1464

kill stream now entering its 13th season has been criticized by human rights experts

1496
04:24:53,120 --> 04:24:59,280
for its brutality having claimed the lives of 210 of its 470 contestants thus far

1497
04:24:59,360 --> 04:25:02,879
showrunners Alan Kroll claimed that all contestants are fully aware of

1498
04:25:02,879 --> 04:25:04,399
all right I know where I can get it I got it

1499

1501
04:25:14,479 --> 04:25:17,760
career any problems these good problems you're right many would argue that the

1502
04:25:17,760 --> 04:25:21,680
corporation is abusing its position of power to take advantage of the destitute and are

1503
04:25:21,680 --> 04:25:26,959
responsible in large part for the cutthroat society we live in Eugene Kristoff when you

1504
04:25:26,959 --> 04:25:33,520
created the show you put the world's deadliest death row inmates on an island to battle to

1505
04:25:33,520 --> 04:25:38,000
the death the winners of the first few seasons have become some of the wealthiest people in

1506
04:25:38,000 --> 04:25:46,399
the world yes is that justice I guess I have what it took death or glory in the past few

1507
04:25:46,399 --> 04:25:51,829
years who do we play as have risen in line with the economic downturn what could do

1508
04:25:51,829 --> 04:25:56,069
everyone these people are a byproduct of the society created by you some would say

1509
04:25:56,069 --> 04:26:00,389
you're a coward having tapped out they can say that's my face you have been inundated

1510
04:26:00,389 --> 04:26:05,030
with applications they have been ground into dust by the boot heel of the rich and powerful

1511
04:26:05,030 --> 04:26:10,469
who are now using them for their own entertainment socialist mother if I didn't know

1696
04:52:46,959 --> 04:52:54,630

1697
04:52:54,630 --> 04:53:03,520
my group yeah right look around they're out here they're probably hiding they did

1698
04:53:07,250 --> 04:53:13,520

goddamn team this guy's fucking dead news guys this shit's fucking real it's fucking

1700
04:53:23,909 --> 04:53:38,790
real hesitation is defeat you know everyone's gonna come after you now in no time at all

1701
04:53:39,430 --> 04:53:51,860
now it's getting interesting no if everyone's look that's the thing if you landed away from

1702
04:53:51,860 --> 04:53:58,520
your group you're not going to hide behind a tree and approach another group choco boy 89

1703
04:53:58,520 --> 04:54:02,279
says it's a little landing not a chance in hell why would you sneak up on another group

1704
04:54:02,279 --> 04:54:10,279
that's not gonna happen i did what i had to do anything in camo camo's so in right now

1705
04:54:10,279 --> 04:54:19,599
really you never see it anywhere seriously though what is this shit these guns are almost antique

1706
04:54:19,599 --> 04:54:27,240
we should head for the center see that what about it it's got to be something it's not

1707
04:54:27,240 --> 04:54:33,159
in the muck exactly there's a bridge up ahead from there we can either go straight through

1708
04:54:33,240 --> 04:54:41,430
or we can go around i don't know straight ahead i feel like everyone's going to be going around

1709
04:54:43,840 --> 04:54:46,720
nobody wants to do the straight shot because as well it's too far in the open we don't want

1710
04:54:46,720 --> 04:55:02,439
to be too exposed but isn't everybody going to be going around i think it's straight on i say

1711
04:55:02,439 --> 04:55:08,180
we go straight through let's go see if we can catch someone off guard no we go the other way

1712
04:55:08,819 --> 04:55:16,770
yeah it makes sense we shouldn't say the risk are you serious i didn't just get telltale

1713
04:55:16,770 --> 04:55:21,810
did i have the trust of his teammates what's it gonna take to pull this back oh wait they

1714
04:55:21,810 --> 04:55:30,159
don't trust me it's actually a meter oh shit they won't listen to me that's actually kind of

1715
04:55:30,159 --> 04:55:41,400
interesting it's illusion of choice but it's not really an illusion of choice is this a team

1716
04:55:41,400 --> 04:55:45,560
morale meter and they would have listened to me if i if i didn't they didn't hate me or

1717
04:55:45,560 --> 04:55:55,779
something i don't know what's the difference between a liberal and a puppy a puppy stops

1718
04:55:55,779 --> 04:56:05,119
whining when it grows up landmine here comes the landmine or maybe they're gonna keep

1719
04:56:05,119 --> 04:56:09,599
them around long enough to like make everybody like hate him and then they'll kill him i don't

1720
04:56:09,599 --> 04:56:27,169
know i'm just gonna keep walking by the way let's talk strategy here if you make it out give me

1721
04:56:27,169 --> 04:56:33,319
a call why would you ever talk like that with your teammates in a life or death scenario where

1722
04:56:33,319 --> 04:56:39,729
you need to like have each other's backs but i i feel i feel like if you don't want your

1723
04:56:39,729 --> 04:56:44,689
teammates to like fucking hate your guts regardless of any of this right why would you

1724

05:01:04,319 --> 05:01:10,020
we got three seconds left and i gotta be honest i'm really not so sure what i should do

1750
05:01:11,090 --> 05:01:18,049
i'm thinking that gav has experience with potential uh survival skills but tish had

1751
05:01:18,049 --> 05:01:36,200
a lot of big brain ideas i'm not so certain about this though she had some i think she's

1752
05:01:36,360 --> 05:02:00,869
probably it's probably to keep the smart person tish tish suspects me oh shit she does you were

1753
05:02:00,869 --> 05:02:08,720
acting sus you've been acting sus towards tish if you save her then she should trust you again

1754
05:02:08,720 --> 05:02:28,080
but tish had a headshot that's right that's right um what but i feel like i haven't heard

1755
05:02:28,080 --> 05:02:36,599
very much from from gav in fact people saying who is gav so just because of that

1756
05:02:37,159 --> 05:02:42,880
i think we have to that's it

1757
05:02:49,840 --> 05:02:54,959
gav is not the annoying guy that's a good job i followed you down

1758
05:02:55,599 --> 05:03:02,580
i could work on the bridge there you really showed them it's your lucky day

1759
05:03:06,049 --> 05:03:13,810
dev the cannibal has cornered his own landing squad and that creative reuse of minds means

1760
05:03:13,889 --> 05:03:20,529
gav sees his final destination tish tasker and nick romeo he did get a headshot that was the

1761
05:03:20,529 --> 05:03:28,849
deciding factor for me that's what put me over the edge i forgot about her arms skills

1762
05:03:35,720 --> 05:03:52,840
tish led you to the bomb trap though looks like the mines they must have figured out

1763
05:03:52,840 --> 05:03:56,599
a way to reuse them the heck i might be impressed with my

1764
05:03:56,599 --> 05:04:01,959
ears stop ringing oh shit she's injured see what happened to the others i didn't see shit

1765
05:04:02,680 --> 05:04:11,319
i think scarlet went down and you shoot out though where are we oh thank god we're five

1766
05:04:11,319 --> 05:04:20,819
miles inland you should have stayed with auto fuck yeah well look what is it he said he was

1767

1768
05:04:38,229 --> 05:04:46,069
you are too though well if somebody wants to decide on taking me over somebody else then

1769
05:04:46,069 --> 05:04:50,549
you know not to take the camper you know it's great to be part of a real team i think you

1770
05:04:50,549 --> 05:05:20,630

05:06:01,750 --> 05:06:07,520
apologize to scarlet's friends and family let's take a moment now in remembrance of her life

1774
05:06:08,770 --> 05:06:19,959
moving on i'm glad i got the mature stream warning on this one holy fucking moly looks

1775
05:06:20,599 --> 05:06:48,240
that was fast we saw where his heart was right at the christopher that was fucking scarring yeah

1776
05:06:48,240 --> 05:07:03,060
that was fucking horrible like forever changed from that one let's stop watching tv you've also

1777
05:07:03,060 --> 05:07:40,869
broadened it out actually good effects though not very realistic but pretty good i mean that

1778
05:07:40,869 --> 05:08:03,139
was fucked up you want another drink yeah how many people are even left on our team

1779
05:08:05,200 --> 05:08:15,889
nick slow down let's take a breather there's something up ahead can we please stop playing

1780
05:08:15,889 --> 05:08:35,799
this um i mean there's only two of us left what what what are you looking for you need to tell

1781
05:08:35,799 --> 05:08:50,610
me what's going on that headcase ari was almost right throw for content i actually have not

1782
05:08:51,169 --> 05:08:57,250
about that but this game is fixed what do you mean winners picked out before the game begins

1783
05:08:58,049 --> 05:09:05,680
how guns are real the mines are real how could you possibly stop someone from getting killed

1784
05:09:05,680 --> 05:09:08,560
it's not a sure thing but from what we can tell what are you saying it's fake

1785
05:09:11,759 --> 05:09:19,520
i'm too speed i'm not here to win tish you need to stop i've been sent here by a group

1786
05:09:19,520 --> 05:09:26,549
called the alliance they've sent me here to expose the truth that the corporation used

1787
05:09:26,549 --> 05:09:33,080
deep fake technology to rig the outcome of kill street with a deep fake stuff computer

1788
05:09:33,080 --> 05:09:37,880
generated scenarios they can alter the broadcast in real time to make things play out the way

1789
05:09:37,880 --> 05:09:43,319
they want why why can't they just let it play out the winner's a puppet all the fame

1790
05:09:43,319 --> 05:09:47,000
and power that come from winning this thing can be controlled if they know who the winner is

1791
05:09:47,639 --> 05:09:52,200
alan corp are fucked they've been hemorrhaging money for years they're on the deep faking people

1792
05:09:52,200 --> 05:09:56,840
dying cost of running this meat grinder adds up the bribes the countries that host it the

1793
05:09:56,840 --> 05:10:02,520
jurisdictions that broadcast it the lawsuits from the contestants estates them with audiences

1794
05:10:02,520 --> 05:10:07,479
dwindling they had to come up with a plan so they started fixing it we're not sure when

1795
05:10:07,479 --> 05:10:12,689
but when the creator left their big changes behind the scenes the winners always became big

1796
05:10:12,849 --> 05:10:17,330
all the way up to the top and then all the way to the top man decided to change that

1797
05:10:17,889 --> 05:10:21,569
with the winners in their pockets they managed to keep things afloat for a while longer

1798
05:10:21,569 --> 05:10:25,569
but now they're getting desperate that's why the rules keep getting more brutal

1799
05:10:26,290 --> 05:10:32,369
so you were being serious about the no tap ups they're doing it to boost the ratings

1800
05:10:33,880 --> 05:10:42,639
and the puppet who is it i'm not sure yet it's him sure it's um it's i'm the bad guy

1801
05:10:42,639 --> 05:10:46,959
probably right it's me who's i talking to on the phone before on the walkie-talkie

1802
05:10:52,229 --> 05:10:58,849
it's me it's gonna be me you're here to expose all of this how why do you be like

1803
05:11:04,450 --> 05:11:11,619
not bad and send you let's just say i have a reason to hate alan corp we're all getting

1804
05:11:11,619 --> 05:11:16,740
deep faked the alliance knew this and it was a safe bet my this is the last thing i'm playing

1805
05:11:16,740 --> 05:11:22,099
before i'm starting streaming they gave me this device a payload that i need to plant in the

1806
05:11:22,099 --> 05:11:28,180
corporation's network if they can get in they can hijack the stream expose it all the deep fakes the

1807
05:11:28,180 --> 05:11:34,500
fix everything so why are you telling me this why isn't the alliance helping you who's the

1808
05:11:34,500 --> 05:11:38,819
no something goes up they switched locations at the last moment who's the known animal

1809
05:11:40,500 --> 05:11:48,180
last dream ever what no i'm saying just for today what about gps our phones blocked

1810
05:11:48,180 --> 05:11:51,380
this all signals in and out of this place go through alan corp's network

1811
05:11:52,560 --> 05:11:57,040
we're almost done ice was meant to be vulnerable to their control but the blast back there must

1812
05:11:57,040 --> 05:12:02,639
have knocked it out i need to find a way in the alan corp's network a comms tower maybe

1813
05:12:02,639 --> 05:12:06,880
i can find a way to get a message out we can find out where the fuck they're going to kill

1814
05:12:06,880 --> 05:12:11,680
you gotta be something i didn't say this was bad they're streaming from all these drones 24

1815
05:12:11,680 --> 05:12:17,479
seven let me see that even if the radio is broken we should be able to get some info from

1816
05:12:17,479 --> 05:12:24,470
the storage i'm not dying on this fucking island for nothing do i do i trust her what do you think

1817
05:12:28,360 --> 05:12:34,900
i don't know i don't think so i'm gonna keep hold of it for now they keep just doing the

1818
05:12:34,900 --> 05:12:46,849
double cross thing no okay it's getting dark if there is a predetermined winner it could be

1819
05:12:46,849 --> 05:13:05,590
anyone you have another tower then we know that so what if it's just her we should take it

1820
05:13:05,590 --> 05:13:10,470
in turns keeping watch and tell them to stop cursing please toss a point no need

1821
05:13:11,669 --> 05:13:15,430
you're concerned about cursing you sure and there was just like a gruesome scene with

1822
05:13:15,430 --> 05:13:22,240
somebody's like face like blown off may as well have the conversation how'd you end up here

1823
05:13:23,279 --> 05:13:33,490
that's complicated answer why not not much call for an aging child actor i didn't make the

1824
05:13:33,490 --> 05:13:42,479
transition you bleep the swears sure tv and film that all changed i will do that for you

1825

reality killed the tv store while you're breaking my heart mikey

1826
05:13:53,060 --> 05:14:00,040

nicky murk you guys do like a double f for one what we're doing on a shelf life

1828
05:14:09,569 --> 05:14:18,369
this hollywood chews you up and spits you out when you do anything you can to stay on top i'm

1829
05:14:18,369 --> 05:14:26,680

1830
05:14:26,680 --> 05:14:38,549
sense drinking drugs made him a different person made him feel invincible he thought

1831
05:14:38,630 --> 05:14:52,799
this was the only way out deep fake it is for some of us i'm sorry i didn't mean

1832
05:15:11,750 --> 05:15:16,150
someone tipping the scales so here i am

1833
05:15:16,549 --> 05:15:23,830
um the ad revenue for my channel since i've been in here that's gotta be something for them right

1834
05:15:25,590 --> 05:15:37,919

1835
05:15:42,720 --> 05:15:48,159
oh my god all right this i haven't had a complaint about this game until right now

1836
05:15:49,840 --> 05:15:55,919

05:19:33,779 --> 05:19:39,479
goddamn lame stream media and their goddamn witch hunts i mean so what if you took a bus

1852
05:19:39,479 --> 05:19:48,849
out of school kids hostage you only killed the teacher you're sure you saw something

1853
05:19:48,849 --> 05:19:56,209
i thought i might have seen an antenna okay what's this about an antenna oh don't even think

1854
05:19:56,209 --> 05:20:01,729
about it no we were wrong i'm sorry i was very wrong six could taking you both down

1855
05:20:01,729 --> 05:20:06,209
then why didn't you douchebag the math like that just might auto i'm so sorry

1856
05:20:06,689 --> 05:20:14,099
hey can we start over you were listening we need to work together that's not what you said to me

1857
05:20:14,099 --> 05:20:22,049
last time we met look i'm so sorry you said you were a camper in um call of duty whatever it

1858
05:20:22,049 --> 05:20:31,840
was there's more going on here than you know lower the gun let's talk camping is a really

1859
05:20:31,840 --> 05:20:38,150
good strategy it keeps your kill death high you get to enjoy the game you can eat a

1860
05:20:38,150 --> 05:20:41,729
sandwich while you're playing you don't have to have two hands the controller i mean that's

1861
05:20:41,729 --> 05:20:47,729
a pain in the ass what's the difference between this island and a dead prostitute

1862
05:20:54,069 --> 05:21:01,279
uh auto hears me saying auto and is walking over here now hello auto well it's a different

1863
05:21:01,279 --> 05:21:14,119
auto not you this island still sucks now we get a new party why don't get is if they can

1864
05:21:14,119 --> 05:21:18,759
fake bits of it why not fake the whole thing why bother going to the expense of hosting it

1865
05:21:18,759 --> 05:21:27,330
in the first place so let's let's get auto involved here too many variables all the drama

1866
05:21:27,330 --> 05:21:33,330
power struggles randomness of people is hard to script plus i don't know whether you notice but

1867
05:21:34,450 --> 05:21:39,889
seriously cutting you want 50 auto cam 50 game that everybody apparently hates that i'm streaming

1868
05:21:40,610 --> 05:21:43,889
that and there's just too many people involved by the time i start fixing this shit

1869
05:21:44,930 --> 05:21:48,689
trust a handful of people at the top to stay quiet they've got the most to lose

1870
05:21:49,409 --> 05:21:51,970
the winner's gonna keep their mouth shut but what about everyone else

1871
05:21:52,689 --> 05:21:59,439
let's see if i can get it so who is it you know the puppet the winners ari seems to think it was all

1872
05:21:59,439 --> 05:22:04,479
fake you know he really believed it maybe he was onto something maybe it's you mysteriously

1873
05:22:04,479 --> 05:22:09,279
popping up after an explosion one foot in one foot out of the group seems a bit suspicious

1874
05:22:11,279 --> 05:22:15,119
could be anyone he needs something i've got my suspicions but he's hungry

1875
05:22:15,200 --> 05:22:18,479
no you hungry fingers it could be more than one for all we know

1876
05:22:22,520 --> 05:22:26,040
west i'm gonna take them out and give them a little snack and then that's where i saw the

1877
05:22:26,040 --> 05:22:31,639
building 50 auto my promise has to be something so you get to a part where i can freeze it

1878
05:22:32,759 --> 05:22:38,040
there you go all right uh this is gonna be the last brb of the night i'll be right back

1879
05:22:38,900 --> 05:26:34,209
and then we'll have a 50 auto cam let's see how if the auto cam will work auto cam okay um

1880
05:26:34,209 --> 05:27:05,080
if he sits down let's see i don't 50 auto cam okay well you want you can't see the game

1881
05:27:05,080 --> 05:27:28,279
okay can you see the game cooking down to the final 10 who cares about the game this tension

1882
05:27:28,279 --> 05:27:34,439
with a spoon nick romeo is still and what do you think in your party maybe there's still hope

1883
05:27:35,080 --> 05:27:41,479
maybe the pieces are just too small this is strange they're not showing anything

1884
05:27:41,479 --> 05:27:49,509
bullshit what the fuck is going on the show's really gone downhill oh the show's gone downhill

1885
05:27:50,630 --> 05:27:55,590
that's two clicks west just past those trees past the mines we're just gonna get through

1886
05:27:55,590 --> 05:28:01,000
the field isn't there another way around the river mines around the island is 200 meters

1887
05:28:01,000 --> 05:28:08,680
oh no i don't this open ground it gives us an advantage so you're on like a bright red blanket

1888
05:28:08,680 --> 05:28:13,159
how can someone who joined this is way too suddenly be so risk averse it doesn't contrast

1889
05:28:13,159 --> 05:28:18,439
well at all i don't know it's better than fumbling around in the dark just hoping to come

1890
05:28:18,439 --> 05:28:25,240
across something okay what are our options well there's one thing that i think might live

1891
05:28:25,240 --> 05:28:30,759
auto reaction go on well you said those guys use the mines to blow up the bridge

1892
05:28:30,759 --> 05:28:34,439
yeah that means one of those assholes has figured out how to rig those mines to blow

1893
05:28:34,439 --> 05:28:39,000
up on command that means it can be hacked if they can be hatched figure out how they're

1894
05:28:39,880 --> 05:28:47,319
itchy head so what we take a live mine and deactivate oh he's hitting his ear that sounds

1895
05:28:47,319 --> 05:28:53,159
like it's gonna take forever not only for the first one these mines are smart which means

1896
05:28:53,159 --> 05:28:58,279
it's probably part of a mesh network they send a signal to arm disarm from mine to mine

1897
05:28:59,080 --> 05:29:03,479
if i can figure out how to break one of these guys security i can maybe disarm the whole

1898
05:29:03,479 --> 05:29:11,319
thing at least the area we're in wow that sounds like a long shot okay then fuckers

1899
05:29:11,319 --> 05:29:15,080
why don't you go grab a big stick and get ready to prod and poke your way through the next 200

1900
05:29:15,080 --> 05:29:19,080
meters of open ground meter by meter i'm sure there's no risk there at all i haven't

1901
05:29:19,080 --> 05:29:25,560
been paying any attention to this what happened uh auto's plan i don't even i don't even know

do that no swatting called the cops and said there was a hostage situation at the house of

1929
05:33:53,810 --> 05:34:03,750
another player so they would send an armed response and what happened auto is killed

1930
05:34:05,840 --> 05:34:12,080
i didn't mean like i don't care about anyone's past the fact is we're already in this situation

1931
05:34:12,080 --> 05:34:17,200
and we have to keep going how do we know he's not the puppet how do we know you're not the

1938
05:35:07,700 --> 05:35:25,479

speedrun 100 auto run no i mean didn't i tell you that near the end i was gonna have to have a

1954
05:38:21,459 --> 05:38:28,439
sacrifice but here's the thing what if they're baking this up what if they're working together

1955
05:38:28,439 --> 05:38:42,240
this could just be an elaborate ruse this is an elaborate ruse they're working i knew it i told

1958
05:39:08,639 --> 05:39:27,680
arc too but you needed a helpful man to take me down this is the end for otto blakely

1959
05:39:27,680 --> 05:39:33,200
necro to his fans and now just plain necrotic to the rest okay so now what

1960
05:39:33,759 --> 05:39:35,680
what is the climax of this whole thing right

1961
05:39:46,419 --> 05:40:32,599
you're just at the beginning your face on autos he's using the webcam i can't do that

1962
05:40:48,930 --> 05:41:06,159
okay i thought he was just saying he wanted to take a bath i wasn't paying too much attention

1963
05:41:06,159 --> 05:41:14,549
okay so what happens here how does this end the acting that acting is not even bad was

1964
05:41:15,189 --> 05:41:18,229
that was like good acting that wasn't bad acting what are you talking about

1965
05:41:18,869 --> 05:41:35,110
i mean some of the acting is not good is not good

1966
05:41:45,430 --> 05:41:56,840
you know you think he's a bad actor i think that guy's pretty good where the

1967
05:41:56,840 --> 05:42:02,279
fuck have you been i got this so wrong i thought this guy was gonna die first and

1968
05:42:02,279 --> 05:42:32,159
they kept him through the whole game like comedy relief guy yeah stealth takedown

1969
05:42:32,159 --> 05:42:41,840
how do you do a stealth takedown if somebody's looking at you i don't know

1970
05:42:41,840 --> 05:43:16,610
how i got over here what yeah search where'd the knife come from i don't remember it was makeup

1972
05:43:31,299 --> 05:43:56,610

another gun upgrade nice go go get in there hurry nick let's talk we can still get on the

1974
05:44:47,090 --> 05:45:05,959
blur and get this all sorted you awake again okay but we're almost there the finale wait what

1975
05:45:05,959 --> 05:45:14,439
what chance do you think you had you fucking muppet see the decision's already been made

1976
05:45:14,439 --> 05:45:20,840
okay but i'm still alive oh the deep fakes are out there as far as the world knows you're

1977
05:45:20,840 --> 05:45:32,279
already dead i can easily just show up and be alive they can't let you there will be

1978
05:45:32,279 --> 05:45:40,659
survivors one survivor anyway oh my god i can't believe he just showed that what the fuck why

1979
05:45:40,659 --> 05:45:58,759
don't remember that happening everyone gets shot through their right eye by the way now what

1980
05:45:58,759 --> 05:46:06,869
put the gun down tish so we made it to the last two that's not true doesn't have to end

1981
05:46:06,869 --> 05:46:12,470
this what about what about the girl the blood in her mouth lived through this maybe she just

1982
05:46:12,549 --> 05:46:22,369
dipped out there are no guarantees what then this right here is the ultimate prize nick

1983
05:46:22,369 --> 05:46:29,270
that's bullshit you just don't get it do you you may have lost your fame your fortune your

1984
05:46:29,270 --> 05:46:36,150
friend but it's just seven times i never had any of that to begin with i came here for

1985
05:46:36,150 --> 05:46:42,229
my family and now i can have it all the hell with everyone else you can't change it nick

1986
05:46:42,950 --> 05:46:48,389
we gotta look out for ourselves there's a better way we can put an end to all this bloodshed you

1987
05:46:48,389 --> 05:46:55,810
are better than this tish you don't know me who i am you still have a choice i never had a choice

1988
05:46:55,810 --> 05:47:12,319
nick don't do it your move fine don't make me do it don't make me do it please tish never

1989
05:47:12,319 --> 05:47:15,759
point a gun at something you don't intend to kill oh you didn't intend to kill me okay well

1990
05:47:16,709 --> 05:47:44,470
never mind

1991
05:48:14,979 --> 05:48:24,639
the broadcast is out you're dead anyway not if i skip the ending cut scene i can do my own deep

1992
05:48:24,639 --> 05:49:03,090
fake chaotic laughter do i live do i survive that that's probably a really bad ending

1993
05:49:03,569 --> 05:49:13,880
oh it's gonna be after credits it's a battle royale you want but i didn't win though

1994
05:49:14,439 --> 05:49:24,130
because they fake the whole thing with cg characters like one of the characters was

1995
05:49:24,130 --> 05:49:28,849
saying earlier what is the point of even doing this show if you can just have realistic

1996
05:49:30,229 --> 05:49:35,990
completely uncanny valley real people cg of people doing this what's the point of doing

1997
05:49:35,990 --> 05:49:52,180
this in real life that might be the worst ending it could be it's probably at least

1998
05:49:52,180 --> 05:50:16,560
like five endings the full screen auto well hold on not yet in one of the other endings

1999
05:50:16,560 --> 05:50:27,189
you hack the stuff and release the deep fake info oh okay all right let's get the credits and see

2000
05:50:27,189 --> 05:51:04,520
what happens there's nothing there is it it's it no morale nobody likes me nobody loves me

2001
05:51:04,520 --> 05:51:20,259
but i'm strong and smart i guess no one likes me but i'm very strong and very smart

2002
05:51:20,819 --> 05:51:40,290
okay decisions made 54 scenes viewed this 294 scenes holy shit damn okay no romances all right

2003
05:51:40,290 --> 05:51:46,119
uh i'm gonna do one thing before we go there's a short video i want to watch it's a short

2004
05:51:46,119 --> 05:51:54,930
sorcery film about this stream and the sorcery game uh but the stream is essentially over

2005
05:51:55,650 --> 05:52:04,290
next time i'll be live will likely be next weekend probably on either friday or saturday

2006
05:52:04,290 --> 05:52:11,459
or sunday keep an eye on the sus likely sunday either maybe friday and sunday or maybe just sunday

2007
05:52:17,090 --> 05:52:33,159
at auto first oh i'm gonna pet you i'm gonna pet mr auto you have a scratchy bum do you

2009
05:52:59,520 --> 05:53:06,310
his penguin stripe okay um i'm going to grab this video real quick give me one second will

2010
05:53:06,310 --> 05:53:14,840
i grab it but that's going to conclude essentially the gaming portion of the stream and i think this

2011
05:53:14,840 --> 05:53:21,279
video is like you two three minutes four minutes something like that those who have never seen

2012
05:53:21,279 --> 05:53:28,290
the sorcery playthrough is one of the first streams i really did on twitch when i went

one wall is the only piece of furniture where an old man sits we're gonna go talk to him

2019
05:55:28,580 --> 05:55:34,900
it's a better movie greetings old man he ignores you he is concentrating hard on

2020
05:55:34,900 --> 05:55:40,099
something on the ground just in front of him you glance upwards to the stars and suddenly

2021
05:55:40,099 --> 05:55:48,130
the old man shouts her sorcerer i knew it you're mistaken you reply cautiously oh i don't think so

2022
