00:00:19,320 --> 00:02:53,719
I have a quick question. If I were to say in a tweet, for instance, like I'm out running something out running the cylinder, is it out space running? Or is it out running one word? Because the other one implies you you're like out. It's one word. Yeah, that's what I thought. All right, in here in a minute. All right, let's go. Let's go. How you doing? Just wanted to get my tea. A nice hot tea here. We're going to pick up where we left off a day or two ago. Still in the eternal cylinder.

2
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:55,379
Well, still trying to outrun the eternal cylinder. Let's get that correct. You finished Elden Ring so fast. Um, I mean, we did it. Took us four streams. Each stream was what? Between seven and nine hours. Took us like 30, 40 hours to do it. There we go. Okay. All right. Are you ready? We're moving. Welcome back. This game is pretty cute. It's really fun. Let's keep playing it. Do we need a recap for anybody that wasn't here? Here's the recap. That's a very

3
00:03:52,219 --> 00:04:14,370
loud for me. I'm so glad I turned it down for you. All right, so here's the recap. I plugged a controller into I'm imagining is probably better this way. So recap. There's a gigantic cylinder that is crushing every I can't we can't we have to move now.

4
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:31,800
All right, that thing instantly kills you. We lost a couple of friends along the way here. The last thing that happened is we went inside we went across. I can't we got to go. We have to we actually have to leave like right now. No.

5
00:04:40,560 --> 00:05:29,040
It's not happening. It's not happening. No, no, no. I'm sorry. That's not happening. I've that's just not happening guys. I'm sorry. That's not the way it works. We got to go. How do I Okay, that's how I do it on controller like this. Okay, who's who's the horn? Who's the horn? You do right? Who's the horn? Somebody has a horn. Can't tell who has the horn. Oh, no, you do. You do. Okay, do it. Hold the horn. Fuck off. Get out of here.

6
00:05:29,040 --> 00:06:26,180
All right. Good. Okay. So recap. Let's get away from that thing because I think it's horrible. Got to get away from the cylinder every time you leave this kind of dome. It's kind of like fortnight area. The cylinder moves. Do I want to do this? This is a goo one. Whoa, I actually kind of like that. I do it. How many stakes? We need six. Do I have six stakes? I have seven stakes. Okay, we can get one. Let's do it. Whoa, this is cool. I like the goo one. All right, let's go. It's like orange.

7
00:06:26,220 --> 00:07:28,750
White and green. Okay, I feel safer. Where's our new friend? Oh, no, it's pink and red. Very cool. All right. Is Gunu dead? No, Gunu is right here. This is Gunu. Everybody hungry? We're good. I mean, this is a hardcore playthrough. If Gunu dies, that's over. I leave. I would be so distraught if that happens. I do kind of have to relearn the game though. I'm playing on a controller. I would cry. All right, here we go. A few stakes. You know, get rid of some of this bullshit. I don't want all this. Here we go.

8
00:07:28,750 --> 00:08:20,220
I don't have anything on the map. The map is kind of all blurry. I think we just have to keep going. You see the big lit up kind of Sauron eye? We have to go over there. We did get a new friend. I can't see very much on the map. I don't know. I think we're just gonna go. So I crossed that threshold. Now the cylinder moves and you got to make it to this thing or you die. Come on, friends. Let's go. This is your quick recap. The Eternal Cylinder. It's a pretty fun game. I don't know how long the game

9
00:08:20,220 --> 00:09:26,210
is, but wait. Oh, he's sparkly. Yeah, I think it's somewhere between 10 and 15 hours. We'll get through it. So we made it. Let's see what happens now. It was so weird going across this thing and seeing the actual huge guy. Spoiler alert, but there's a huge guy. We got everybody. Yep. We got everybody. Everybody eat. Yeah, the mathematician. Yep. The mathematician was as weird as that thing. Okay. All right. We're not going over there. I'm not going that way. Do I still have? Do I have

10
00:09:26,210 --> 00:10:02,370
a map yet? I don't. How do I make the map not scrambled? I want to be able to see where I can go. This time, the Trevor knew what they were feeling. Here was another servant of the cylinder. But what shape would this creature's evil take? It did not seem interested in the Trevor. The servant of the cylinder had released a swarm. Small parasites had come from within it and attached themselves to the creatures of this area.

11
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:46,940
I'm ready to burn. It was somehow using them to corrupt the tower, to turn its protective force into a trap. What? All Tribum hate parasites by nature. And they hated these even more. They would have to remove them. But how? Burn. I burn? All right. I'm going to try. I'm going to everybody stay back. I'm going to try burning. No, get away. Get away. Get away. Get away. I don't want anybody to die. I wonder how I do that.

12
00:10:46,940 --> 00:11:59,679
How do I do this? I can't save it here. Come on, get it off. All right. It's just water. It's one. Actually, get it. No, no, no. Move out of the way. Another friend over there. Bring it. Do we get it? I don't think so. Where is it? Where is it attached? On the back? Get the fuck out of here. No, I don't know. I don't know where it is. It's like on the back leg. I get it. OK, got it. Oh, it completely missed everybody. Holy shit.

13
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:29,159
I can't believe nobody got hurt. OK, this is a huge pain in the ass. How am I supposed to reliably do this without everybody getting killed? All right, there. Got it. OK, like hit its head. We're good.

14
00:12:30,299 --> 00:13:28,029
There's one, two more or one more. I wonder what happens when I do this. That's three. I think I killed it. I killed it. Did I? Yeah, I think I think it's just dead. So true.

15
00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:57,679
Yeah, true, true. Let's go back to Gunnu. Pick up the stuff that you sprayed. That's a good idea. Wait, what is anything on this? The one fell over here.

16
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:25,539
Why do you hate Gunnu? All right, where is it? Right here? Is that it? I don't think that's it. Where did it fall off? I was too busy trying to I was panicking because I didn't want to die.

17
00:14:25,779 --> 00:15:14,279
All right, can I get this one? Three and no, I can't. Sorry, buddy. I don't remember where they are. I'm too afraid to investigate anymore. Yeah, this is this is just me dying matter. This is definitely an opportunity where I can pick it up again. It's all good.

18
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:50,960
I wish I wish I had a way to defend myself. I want I want like a trebum that has a fucking like gun. What does this do again? Oh, the the eyes. OK. Um, I think somebody already have this. Oh, my God. Will you leave me the fuck alone?

19
00:15:55,299 --> 00:16:08,009
I can't even have five seconds to look at the menu. All right. Come here. You. Hey, hey, hey, new guy. This is yours.

20
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:29,419
Get up. Leave me alone. I want to move. Move. Move. It's gonna be like a chill night. This I these fucking random ass creatures. I want to just I want to just blow them up.

21
00:16:30,909 --> 00:16:48,009
This is no way to go. I have to just keep moving. If I stop for more than 10 seconds, everybody dies. OK. Can you eat that? Oh, my God. Leave us alone for one second. Leave me fucking alone.

22
00:16:48,730 --> 00:17:15,230
I'm not going that way yet. Use the horn. I only have one. One of my random assholes has it. OK, you have the horn. I'm just I'm only playing as this character.

23
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:26,980
I think the horn actually pisses them off and makes them more angry sometimes, though. Oh, fuck. I went across the threshold. Good to go.

24
00:17:29,099 --> 00:18:10,940
Um, what? I got time. Yeah, this time I got plenty of time. No, we're good. OK. Can they not be like a hundred monsters everywhere right now? Thank God. That was horrible.

25
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:30,980
OK. Never mind. It's about to get way worse. Keep up. Keep up. Keep up. Keep up. OK. Where's the next one? It's OK. We have to we have to keep it in between us.

26
00:18:31,339 --> 00:18:44,349
Where? Come on, hurry up. Hurry up. Face toot. I don't know what that person's name is. Don't fall behind. Don't fall behind. Come on. You can do it.

27
00:18:45,869 --> 00:19:13,720
Come on. Why is he so slow? Keep going. Oops. We got everybody. We got I think we got everyone. Everybody safe. We got to stay close.

28
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:45,980
We got that. That's fine. I think better not swoop down. Do not swoop down. Do not swoop down. Hold on. Where's my friend? Where are they? Where are they? Where are they? Come here. You. Leave. Leave us alone. Leave us alone. Leave us alone.

29
00:19:47,299 --> 00:20:03,509
Leave us alone. Leave us alone. Leave us alone. We're just trying to survive like you. Leave us alone. Leave us alone.

30
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:27,329
Did he get somebody? Oh, shit. I think we're OK. Do not swoop. No, no, that's it. Oh, no. We're good. We're good. We got it. We got it. We got it. I can't go too far because if I go too far, then they get struck by lightning. We're all right.

31
00:20:28,089 --> 00:20:49,069
Stick together. You need to look where you're going. I know where I'm going. I can't go too far, though. All right. I'm going too far. Get away from us.

32
00:20:51,460 --> 00:21:44,049
Get out. Get out. Is everybody OK? I think so. Almost there. I can't. Not yet. I got to wait. I'm too far ahead. I need food. Does anybody have any? You do. OK, now I'm going to cross it. Thank God. All right. Please don't have that. Keep going. If this thing goes down too, I'm going to be so pissed.

33
00:21:44,049 --> 00:22:43,059
Wait, just in case it doesn't need food. My God, there's no vegetation here. I mean, this is water, but no, no. Here you go. I'm all right. This doesn't count as food, right? Are we good? Oh, thank God. OK, so for those of you who don't know what just happened, sometimes that is not enough to stop the cylinder and it keeps going. But if you go too far, everybody gets struck by lightning and dies. Let's eat. Oh, thank goodness. Everybody fill up. Anyone want that?

34
00:22:48,779 --> 00:23:58,769
We're all still so hungry. Somebody said, dude, that was not chill. No, it wasn't. It was not chill. That doesn't work. It was the worst enemy in the game. What did I just do? Oh, shit. I didn't want to do that. I ate the wrong thing. No. Burn him. Burn him alive. Burn him. Somebody burn him. Somebody burn this guy. Burn him. Somebody help me. Excuse me. Help. Somebody burn him. Can I help? Somebody help me. Help me. Somebody help. Fuck you. Fuck you.

35
00:23:58,769 --> 00:25:01,920
Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. I'm going to take more than that. I'm going to take more than that to kill Wee Womp. Wait, let's go. Somebody help me. Somebody help me. Somebody. What was I doing? I was going to fucking do something. I mean, I couldn't do anything, but you know. All right. All right. All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Let's temple over her. Somebody help me. Somebody help me. They're still hungry. There's no chill. There's no time for me to chill. I want to eat stuff.

36
00:25:01,920 --> 00:26:08,000
Some flying enemies just ruin everything. All right. Now we're full. Let's keep going. I don't care what this does. Other side probably. Oh, my God. Don't even. This is dangerous now. Every day. There we go.

37
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:23,789
This place made the trebum uncomfortable. It felt like a place of desperation where terrible, bitter things had happened a long, long time ago.

38
00:26:24,109 --> 00:27:02,940
I'm good on food. Let's get topped off. What is that? Did you just die? You all right? I can't move. No, it doesn't mean all of you don't come over here and investigate it. Get out of the way. It's OK. All right.

39
00:27:03,019 --> 00:28:03,630
Um, I got an idea. You didn't drop anything. Oh, new power. I wonder. All right. I've got legs on here. I've got two flames. Anybody kind of miss it. You got water. I'm going to give it to to you over here. I feel like we could see what it is better off you getting it. All right.

40
00:28:03,630 --> 00:29:05,089
The new guy. Oh, yeah, that's right. I forgot you existed. All right. Moment of truth. Sucker feet allows the trebum to attach to surface and remain glued. How do I do that side? Oh, that's very helpful. Actually, I feel like I want everybody to have that. That probably prevents being picked up by the birds. I'm going to give that to everybody that doesn't. Yeah, let's give it to everybody. Everybody has 10 of these has it. All right. Spread it around. I don't want you have the stomp feet.

41
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:25,410
So I don't want you to do it, but I want it's going to replace the jumping. You still have jumped, though. So I think that's fine. I'm going to give it to. Yeah, let's give it to Gunnu. I didn't mean to do that. I pressed. I pressed the wrong fucking button.

42
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:44,970
And this is what happens when you didn't play with the controller last time you played keyboard and mouse. You plug the controller in. So B is like the back button. Why am I playing with the controller? Because it feels way better than WASD.

43
00:29:44,970 --> 00:30:09,500
That's great. I guess I could just three minutes. That's not that big of a deal. Yeah, it's not too bad. I think it's when we open the door here. It is. OK, so let's just bring this. Use the stomp.

44
00:30:12,509 --> 00:30:27,650
OK, this place made the trebum uncomfortable. It felt like a place of desperation where terrible, bitter things had happened a long, long time ago.

45
00:30:28,049 --> 00:30:30,569
I don't want anyone to die. See if I can do it right here.

46
00:30:31,569 --> 00:31:01,619
It just picked somebody up. OK, it was about to like eat that person. All right. So you are going to do it. So just do it. So that's Sticky Feet for you. He's so much cooler now. I love him even more. All right.

47
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:51,220
Sticky Feet for you. Sticky. Yes, you guys. So then we have swimmer, three suckers, a jumper and a stomper. I think that's good. There we go. This is the dream blunt rotation. No, it's not. It's not. I wonder if I can break this. Yes, it is.

48
00:31:51,220 --> 00:32:41,680
All right. You're telling me that these five trebums are your dream blunt rotation. The one, two, three, four. Wait, these six trebums. Yes. OK, we need to. Of course it is. You don't want anybody else throughout all of history, all any character, any celebrity, any history. Like, I don't know. Abraham Lincoln is not in there. It's these five. It's five trebums and Abraham Lincoln. Dream blunt rotation.

49
00:32:41,680 --> 00:33:36,549
All right. What am I supposed to be doing? No. Interesting. What is that? What it do? Secret. What's that? Another power. I don't know who should eat this. Probably this one, right? This guy. This one doesn't have a body. Save scum. I can't. All right. New guy. Go ahead.

50
00:33:36,549 --> 00:33:51,619
The mixer mutation allows the trebum to combine specific ingredients to create offensive projectiles. Finally, that can be launched at enemies.

51
00:33:51,619 --> 00:34:11,340
There was something strange about this new body that Trebum thought. It was powerful, but also a little frightening. Finally, a gun. They now had the ability to mix ingredients in order to create projectiles with which they could attack other creatures.

52
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:24,820
This new power might be necessary for their survival. Thank God. OK, so this is now a gun to make sure to use it carefully so they would never become as cruel as the servants of the cylinder. This is hurt.

53
00:34:24,820 --> 00:35:02,619
What the fuck? It's a grenade. What? Oh, you all right? You get out of the way. I don't know what I did. I don't know what I did. The chain reaction reaction just went off. I'm sorry. I'm testing. I'm testing it. Just mix everything. Wait, is this the slot that I think this cannot be used?

54
00:35:06,099 --> 00:35:29,780
I can't. All right. My play the resident before remake 100% guaranteed 100% guaranteed. Yes. Can I break this? Maybe I can break it with my new grenade. Ready? Get out of the way. Get out of the way. I don't want to hurt anybody.

55
00:35:30,780 --> 00:36:10,480
Can I not shadow this? Well, let's get the info. Yes, the map. Thank God. So this little guy has to survive under any means necessary. Without this, we have no offense. So I have to control this character. Very cool. I think that's it.

56
00:36:10,480 --> 00:37:01,699
Hold on now. Who doesn't have a body? You don't. Fire doesn't. You don't have a body. You do now. Nice. All right. This guy is now total offense. These are the floating things, right? I feel like I should hang on to maybe one or two of these. I wish I could store them somewhere. I wish I had a chest.

57
00:37:01,699 --> 00:37:38,750
All right. In the meantime, I have projectiles on you. Let's get I'm ready. I'm ready to shoot a grenade if I need to. Who is the chest? Yeah, but I mean, not like two extra three extra slots. I mean, you know what I mean? You can put them on your stored. You're a teammate turning it into water.

58
00:37:38,750 --> 00:39:02,929
Wait, hold on. Why are they over here? Why are they split up like this? Kind of weird. There's a hole back in the wall. Was there? Gunu is looking svelte today. What is svelte? Oh, what's up? How you doing? Um, ah, shoot him. Shoot him. What? Why did I was shooting? Why? I'm excuse me. I'm literally holding right trigger and he sprayed water at him. Yeah, fuck you. Was that a new thing? Somebody eat me?

59
00:39:06,690 --> 00:40:40,500
You eat it. You eat this. I don't know what it does, but you eat it. Oh, oh, oh, that's not good. Um, sorry. Okay, well, we're gonna just keep moving. I need some ingredients. We're okay. Where am I going from here? Straight up. There's a hole on the left. I'm going to go the hole like over here. I don't want to miss all these things. There's a lot of good stuff in here. Okay, this little village area. All right, make some grenades. I gotta have a good stockpile of these. That's a different grenade. That's different. I have no idea what that does, but all I care about

60
00:40:40,500 --> 00:41:56,179
is does it hurt. I don't care about anything else. Shit, this is a poison hole. They still, a bunch of them still have the poison resist. Does that matter? What if one of them goes down and doesn't have poison resist? Is it okay? Find out. Okay. Yep. Nice. Where am I going? Down here. Because this one is free. You okay? I have it. I can get him. Hold on. What's up here? Dude, what is this? These are like super rocks. I'm keeping him. Gino!

61
00:41:56,179 --> 00:43:40,940
Sick! How many do I have? Seven? I wonder if I can break these. No, they made it a point that these were here. Why were these incubating? Maybe for ammo. That's a good idea. Find out. So if I give you these, is that doing anything? Cluster bomb? Big cluster bomb. I don't think I can mix it with anything yet. It should be seven. I don't, that's poison stuff. Well then that's glow in the dark. Wait, maybe somebody should be glow in the dark. I'm going to take it for now. Why is there weird music playing right now? Look at all this.

62
00:43:40,940 --> 00:44:45,599
Okay. So this is a, I got to, all right, we got to do some inventory management here. So you would, okay. No, not, no, no. You, no, no, no. I don't want you to get rid of those. No. Gas bomb? I mean, actually kind of cool. Nevermind. Do that. You're missing the one that went blind. I did? Wait, where? One, two, three, four, five. No, I got seven. Okay. Take the rest of these. Nice. All right. So this is a full heal. This is full food and full water. Gino, you hold on to that stuff.

63
00:44:45,599 --> 00:45:57,570
I think, I think it's got web feed already. Cool. Wow. All right. Cool. All right. I'm happy with this group. I do want to be on one of the offense. Yep. Okay. Is somebody on offense? Get out of here. He doesn't, but it still looks cool. They all look cool in their own way. Oh, fuck. Oops. Positivity, Andy. Um, are you, hold on a minute. Who doesn't look cool in their own cool way in our group? Everybody looks super cool. Yeah. Where are you? You're about to get fucking poisoned.

64
00:45:57,570 --> 00:47:12,320
Grenade shot into your face. All right. There's another thing over here. I can go to investigate that. I like the blue one. I'm going to pick my favorite right now. Uh, goo, goo. One's goo. One's my favorite. Gunu is still, you know, pretty cool, but I'm going to have to go with, uh, gonna have to go with you with that one. I got my bomb selected. Continue the investigation. How you guys doing? Are you doing good? How's your, uh, is your week gone? I cannot wait to kill this thing. I can't wait. You're the, I'm going to make sure you die. Fuck you. Oh yeah. Oh,

65
00:47:12,320 --> 00:48:29,489
yeah. Somebody else has to do it now. Wait, what? I can't shoot that high. Oh shit. Everybody. We're good. We're okay. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. I used every single poison bomb. Fuck shit. What is this? This is the fire. There's so many decisions. I, it's too, it's, it's too cool. Oh, egg. What was that? Can I hatch it from here? Yup. We're going to have eight. All right. Come on. Hatch. Oh no. Look at how cool this one is. This one has like cool hair.

66
00:48:29,489 --> 00:50:09,789
Um, that's not good. All right. I need to mark where that is. I think you're just going to die. Sacrifice Gunu? No, nobody can be sacrificed. They're all. Yeah. I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do about this. I'm not sacrificing anybody. Who has the stakes? You do. I'm not sacrificing anybody. I'm sorry. There's a storage place. Okay. I got to remember where this is. It's right on the kind of corner here and I got to go over here. I'll be back. I can store somebody. I'll be back. All right. Who's getting uploaded? Yeah. But do I want us to, I mean, I don't know who to upload. I guess you could get uploaded.

67
00:50:09,789 --> 00:51:33,539
You're the swimmer. All right. Woogwool. You're getting uploaded. Oh no. Sad. We can bring them back. Woogwool has been uploaded. How much does it cost to bring somebody back? Too expensive. Too expensive. All right. Let's go get the other one. Somebody have a bomb? Don't even think about it. Just move. Just move. Just move. Not worth it. All right. Cool hair friend. Aha. Groppo. All right. Groppo. Come with us. What the fuck? Okay. I think there's one more thing over here. What is it? You see this? Where is this going?

68
00:51:33,539 --> 00:52:39,119
Oh yeah. For that very, all right. It's time to move. You guys ready to go? Let's eat first. I already have. Who is it? You got the steaks. Yeah. Eat all these steaks. You have the steak. We're good on food. Oh yeah. You got all the steaks. All right. Continue. I'm thinking of going. I'm going to just bang around here. Yeah. All right. Let's go. Change his name. I don't think I can. Groppo? Groppo? All right. Fill up that meter. I'm very interested. All right. We got to, this is a pretty good party. We have offense now.

69
00:52:39,119 --> 00:54:24,059
And go. This is not too far. Wait. You're a new animal that I saw early and I don't know what to do with. Nevermind. Okay. Everybody safe? Yes. What was that? Did you see that? It's like a giant tail. That was actually kind of terrifying. All right. We got something over here. Finally. It's warm. Yeah. Thank God. Another friend. Possible. God. Come on.

70
00:54:24,059 --> 00:55:45,250
What do you want? What was that for? That's it. What is that thing? No, we're good. Oh no. It's taking powers away. It's taking our powers away. It's taking powers away. What the fuck is this? Wait. No. What? What's going on?

71
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:48,260
Hold on. Go back. What am I doing? I'm trying to get away from the light. It just follows you around. Can we stand? I don't. I think this is scripted because there's nowhere to go. I think we're supposed to have this happen for like now. I can't outrun it. Look, I literally can't outrun it. What would I need to do? I don't understand. What does it want me to do? Sticky feet? Close the thing. Something nearby may help. Yeah. I mean, that's

72
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:29,219
pretty vague, though. I don't know if it wants me to like attack somebody or get one of these monsters to move around or just run in the temple or the strangely named evil giant was back. What was he hunting for? What monstrosities would he summon this time?

73
00:57:31,219 --> 00:57:31,980
Fuck you, buddy.

74
00:57:40,739 --> 00:57:41,300
All right, get in.

75
00:57:46,849 --> 00:57:50,380
It's definitely something in here. Maybe not.

76
00:58:13,739 --> 00:58:36,869
I have discovered the recipe to permanently imbue my body with the power of this mutation and protect it from the evil light of our enemies. You must learn to use this formula as I did long before you, or you will never gain enough strength to continue our people's struggle.

77
00:58:36,869 --> 00:58:42,420
The trebum thanked the apparition, never knowing that it couldn't hear them.

78
00:58:50,090 --> 00:59:21,000
Mutation tree? Is this just, hold on, filtered? Is this like a permanent upgrade system? Okay, so track this. So this is a toxic filter. Oh, you just got Elden Ring.

79
00:59:21,000 --> 01:00:30,340
Okay, so is another egg here? No, it's just this. It's just this person's ass. I don't think I'm going to have enough for anything. I think I'm going to do health. I feel like I want it. How can we referring to everything as a person? I don't know. This is a little like a little person. I don't know. A little alien, a little creature. I don't know. It's very. Yeah, it's not. It's definitely an alien.

80
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:55,300
Not a person. It's a a creature of some sort of of of intelligence. I don't know. There are people. Yeah, whatever. What do you guys think health health is for? What do I just hold? What do you guys think?

81
01:00:55,300 --> 01:01:23,699
As the trebum prepared to leave the cave, the apparition spoke one final time. If you are lost and wandering helplessly across the land, look to the sky and seek a celestial serpent. Yeah, we did that already. And they were mean many tales which hang down from the clouds as the serpents contemplate the matters of the heavens.

82
01:01:24,539 --> 01:01:44,480
These serpents guard the way to the wisest of our kind who can guide you to salvation. That's it. We came across one that was made of asking the apparition to join them. But before they could, it had faded away like the voice in their minds. It was only a memory.

83
01:01:44,480 --> 01:02:59,010
I'm doing health. OK, so that's very interesting is now I have this mutation tree. Three of those plus one egg means I can just use it. But OK, is there anything I can do to prevent being leaping legs and feet? There's a bunch of other stuff I haven't found yet. There's a lot of stuff I haven't found. All right, so the play is I got to get out of here and I have to go very fast just away from this area. Yeah, it should be saved in here. I mean, all my friends ready to move. We've got to go very fast.

84
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:38,179
Right when we get out, we're going to move you on silently and make dad noises. I'm curious. I'm probably are you talking about like the ingredients required for the impervious mutation were all here. But stealing an onkyford egg was easier said than done. Oh, my God. And cracking one open was even harder.

85
01:03:38,179 --> 01:03:56,579
OK, we get get out of the way of this is going to take away our powers in order in order to permanently protect a mutation from the light radiated by the servants of the cylinder, you must find underground shrines where recording will teach you the ingredients required to permanently protect that mutation.

86
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:22,710
Ah, so we have to so we have to find shrines. This area is enclosed by poisonous gas that can't be filtered by the filter trunk mutation over the nearby servant will not allow you to keep your mutations. Find the ingredients requested in the filter trunk node in the mutation tree and activate them there.

87
01:04:23,769 --> 01:04:56,380
OK, I can. So I think it's I think if I lose mutation, yeah, I think it's just going to happen. Right. Yeah, it's OK. It's all right with this happened before. Yeah, there's no there's no hiding. Really? We just have to kind of do it again.

88
01:04:58,849 --> 01:05:00,849
How do I get you to get off of there?

89
01:05:16,630 --> 01:05:43,090
All right. Now, get up. You know, just take it. Just get one. I got one. I got one. All right. Let's get out of here. Let's get out of here. What do I do? I have to break it. There's one. Now I see three of these things.

90
01:05:44,809 --> 01:05:56,809
The trebum had stolen the ocky fat egg, but cracking its thick shell was proving difficult. I already got it. Perhaps the answer lay in the mighty jaws of the fearsome Omnigrom.

91
01:05:57,409 --> 01:06:38,500
I just broke it, man. What are you going about? OK, so now I can mix items. So now they permanently have a filter trunk mutate permanently. Hey, that work for as it for everybody. That's like a thicker one, too.

92
01:06:38,539 --> 01:06:53,139
Look at that. Is it for everybody? It is for everybody. Oh, that's so awesome. Thank God. Oh, my God. That's so much better. Perfect. Oh, yeah.

93
01:06:58,619 --> 01:07:35,099
So then what is this? What is this saying? Is there a person here? What the hell? Puzzle. Any more of those? Yep. This is a Lego Star Wars ass puzzle.

94
01:07:37,719 --> 01:08:03,699
Kind of is. Where's that thing that I'm moving? Is it down here somewhere? Looks like it's down here somewhere. Can I just jump out of here? What's the significance of doing this?

95
01:08:05,769 --> 01:08:46,029
It's just making stairs. All I'm going to scream for. I don't know. A lot longer than than right now. I don't know. Yeah, I don't. What's the significance of this? This is not like a big deal. I have a jumper. I can jump out of this if I wanted to.

96
01:08:58,409 --> 01:09:22,140
You don't have a jumper. Gunnu has the jumper legs. Where is Gunnu? Oh, that's right. Everything. I was like, where is it? Right. It's all the powers got removed. OK. I was like, what happened?

97
01:09:25,289 --> 01:09:46,899
So this is not right. Where's my where's my where's my big friend? All right. So I'm just going to move. I want to make sure I didn't miss anything. Didn't. All right. Are we good? I got to go straight and go. I do need water, but it's OK.

98
01:10:05,619 --> 01:10:21,140
The song reminds me of something that would be played in Rugrats. This is a Rugrats theme that like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

99
01:10:37,569 --> 01:11:18,979
You've never seen the Rugrats? It's an old cartoon. Back to the cold. Oh, OK. Hold on. All right. There's nothing here, technically. So just explore a little bit. Don't get killed.

100
01:11:18,979 --> 01:11:33,039
Save it water

101
01:11:33,079 --> 01:11:53,699
Which rug rat would you be? I think I'd be yeah, I'd be grandpa. Oh mornin' Sprout. How you doing mornin' Sprout?

102
01:11:54,260 --> 01:12:13,920
Yeah, no, you're stew. No, I am NOT stew pickles. Oh, we need

103
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:26,869
Jackets, there are no jacket plants anywhere over here. There we go right here. I'm not stew pickles

104
01:12:26,869 --> 01:12:44,529
No, I'm not I refuse to listen to that. Aha. It is warm again

105
01:12:54,789 --> 01:13:03,260
Average stew reaction. Wait, so hold on the way. Wait, wait, it's stew

106
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:09,239
It's still the one that talks like this. Who's the mother talks like this? Who's the mother?

107
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:29,909
Who's the Brian Griffin was it? What's his name? Is that stew? Okay, the second one. What was stews?

108
01:13:29,909 --> 01:13:42,659
What was stews brother's name both the glasses drew? Okay. Yeah. All right for a second

109
01:13:42,659 --> 01:13:45,260
I thought you talked about I was drew pickles and I was like, bro

110
01:13:45,260 --> 01:13:49,600
I am NOT drew pickles now. I could I could see stew. I could see that makes sense to me

111
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:59,739
All right, we're going for that hole over there remember why are you making chocolate pudding?

112
01:14:01,229 --> 01:14:21,350
That I actually probably would do that. That actually sounds like pretty pretty good idea right now. Actually, this is moving kind of fast

113
01:14:21,350 --> 01:14:39,020
Oh, this one's moving much faster than the other one did. I made mac and cheese before at like 2 a.m

114
01:14:39,020 --> 01:14:51,310
Yeah, but that was a completely different scenario. Maybe one day I'll explain that scenario. Yeah. All right

115
01:14:51,310 --> 01:14:55,609
So yeah, this is this is this is a topic for another day

116
01:14:56,369 --> 01:15:08,399
Okay, so I'll bring it I'll bring the topic up so I

117
01:15:09,199 --> 01:15:12,960
I was I may have been I may have had some marijuana

118
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:22,500
This is a couple weeks ago and I posed the question to Holly and this was an incredibly deep conversation

119
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:33,720
I asked we're talking about like food and I sit there going who made the first sauce who made the first

120
01:15:34,119 --> 01:15:42,010
Sauce because at some point, you know food was for energy food was to survive

121
01:15:42,449 --> 01:15:50,319
Who the fuck decided to make the first sauce and I wrote down on whiteboard a

122
01:15:51,020 --> 01:15:59,520
Shitload of information because it was the questions were okay. If you're a hunter-gatherer, you don't you can't make a sauce

123
01:16:00,119 --> 01:16:08,550
When did pickiness when did preference become a thing was it a surplus of food who made the first sauce?

124
01:16:09,029 --> 01:16:16,800
Because why would you make a sauce? Why would you make a sauce? There's no reason for it. Oh today

125
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:23,590
We've got onions and meat. I'm gonna make our shoe. No, no, no, no you eat because food was scarce

126
01:16:24,189 --> 01:16:31,140
At what who why would you make a sauce? Like whoa, you know, why would you make a sauce?

127
01:16:31,859 --> 01:16:43,560
Until preference and became a thing, right? Possibly the oldest recorded European sauce is

128
01:16:44,199 --> 01:16:47,479
Garum the fish sauce used by the ancient Romans

129
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:49,779
Okay

130
01:16:49,779 --> 01:16:53,300
so but but why if

131
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:59,899
Food was as from caveman times to hunter-gatherers food was you eat food eat the food

132
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:03,779
There's no like, oh, I'm give me like four or five hours to make up like a fucking sauce

133
01:17:03,779 --> 01:17:12,149
No, you eat that fucking meat that we just got this four onions out back yet

134
01:17:12,149 --> 01:17:16,550
When did it was its taste? So when did taste become a thing that you could care about?

135
01:17:17,829 --> 01:17:31,859
Romans it was rich people

136
01:17:35,409 --> 01:17:51,029
Yeah, once a bund yeah abundance hold on a second this is important

137
01:18:00,770 --> 01:18:11,029
Okay, so what I'm about to present to you I'm gonna present to you something is the whiteboard

138
01:18:11,670 --> 01:18:14,189
That I wrote on with the help from Holly

139
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:22,100
And we're gonna go over it was just very quickly

140
01:18:22,779 --> 01:18:29,359
Very quickly. I had to write this down because I don't in my brain

141
01:18:29,359 --> 01:18:32,399
I'm like this is kind of wild to think about like what who why would you make a sauce?

142
01:18:32,399 --> 01:18:34,479
Like why who would do that?

143
01:18:34,479 --> 01:18:45,619
Abundance joy has a happiness. Hold on. I'll just show it for a minute. Okay

144
01:18:52,829 --> 01:19:00,560
Where'd it go? Hold on

145
01:19:09,439 --> 01:19:24,279
Okay, what the hell? Why can I not save this as an image? I'm gonna save it as

146
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:44,710
There it is. What the fuck? It's a J. It's a JPEG on my desktop. Why is it not showing up on my desktop now?

147
01:19:44,710 --> 01:19:51,539
I don't understand computers. It doesn't make any sense save to desktop this image and it's not there

148
01:19:51,539 --> 01:20:05,960
I just literally just did it three times. Okay, there it is. All right, let's go over this really really quick

149
01:20:28,670 --> 01:20:33,430
All right, so let's go over this really really fast

150
01:20:33,430 --> 01:20:40,399
I don't want to spend too much time on this who made the first sauce was a caveman

151
01:20:40,399 --> 01:20:48,289
No, survival only no time for sauce food was hard to get hunter-gatherers people. Why make sauce people were nomadic

152
01:20:48,289 --> 01:20:50,270
What what was the first sauce?

153
01:20:50,270 --> 01:20:58,630
When was the concept of taste when something isn't just feel what I need this to wait

154
01:20:58,630 --> 01:21:05,180
What does it say? I need this to taste the way that I want no such thing as picky

155
01:21:05,180 --> 01:21:12,279
When did humans allow picky preferences smells no matter what there's no reason to make a sauce

156
01:21:12,739 --> 01:21:21,000
There is no reason that just kind of isn't the answer was watch ratatouille

157
01:21:21,180 --> 01:21:24,909
The concept of being picky luxury joy smells

158
01:21:25,270 --> 01:21:32,380
Hawley told me to watch ratatouille and I told her I don't think I can handle ratatouille right now

159
01:21:32,579 --> 01:21:36,590
While this whole conversation was happening. I was going from the whiteboard

160
01:21:36,590 --> 01:21:44,399
I was making mac and cheese on the stove at two o'clock in the morning. I remember just going slop like

161
01:21:45,180 --> 01:21:49,560
Slop she's like you should just watch ratatouille. It's kind of that concept that same concept

162
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:52,199
I don't think I can handle ratatouille right now

163
01:21:52,340 --> 01:21:59,140
Like I was when I quit I was like too high for ratatouille and I'm like, what does that even mean?

164
01:21:59,380 --> 01:22:10,100
But I don't know how to think about it. Like who why would you make who made the first sauce?

165
01:22:10,340 --> 01:22:35,130
I'm saying it like that like what how does Mike rat rat rat ratatouille ratatouille ratatouille ratatouille

166
01:22:35,569 --> 01:22:49,819
Well, isn't it about a rat ratatouille? It's not ratatouille. Okay, I gotta go this way. I'm done

167
01:22:51,659 --> 01:22:54,670
That oh by the way

168
01:22:55,470 --> 01:23:01,229
Holly in the middle of that took over and was writing for me because I went mid-sentence and said hey, can you do this instead?

169
01:23:01,930 --> 01:23:03,930
She's like, ah sure. I guess

170
01:23:04,329 --> 01:23:08,569
That's why like the handwriting changes like halfway through

171
01:23:09,630 --> 01:23:22,369
Yeah, but everything that we can talk about the concept of abundance or being picky or preference or taste or smells or just happy

172
01:23:22,369 --> 01:23:29,279
It tastes good that concept almost like why who decided to like make the first one

173
01:23:29,619 --> 01:23:40,130
Did you just have too much fucking corn and you just squished it is an interesting concept. It's not hard

174
01:23:40,130 --> 01:23:43,069
No, it isn't hard. But what somebody had to make that call?

175
01:23:45,359 --> 01:23:59,619
Am I going the right way? Yeah, wait sure, dude. Yeah, somebody had to make that call somebody had to be like

176
01:23:59,619 --> 01:24:04,000
You know what? We have a lot of onions. I'm gonna just ruin them all. What are you talking about? Don't do that

177
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:09,899
You're gonna mash up like fit ten of them. Yeah, we need those to eat. Yeah, but I want to make a sauce

178
01:24:10,359 --> 01:24:14,659
No, you're talking about what is that? What are you talking about? You're not don't touch those fucking onions

179
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:23,489
That's for the next six months. I missed a fucking thing

180
01:24:24,090 --> 01:24:34,079
Sorry. Oh, oh, oh, oh

181
01:24:34,819 --> 01:24:54,439
What happened? It was agriculture. Okay, so something went wrong there. I probably need heat resistance

182
01:24:54,880 --> 01:25:01,369
From what? Hold on. I went I kind of was walking back. I gotta go back this way

183
01:25:01,810 --> 01:25:11,909
The first sauce had to have been mayonnaise. Think about it. I don't think that's accurate

184
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:32,039
Wait, wait, wait, somebody has an answer on lack of refrigeration in the early days of cooking meat poultry fish seafood didn't last long

185
01:25:32,439 --> 01:25:35,979
Sauces and gravies were used to make the flavor of tainted foods

186
01:25:36,359 --> 01:25:41,779
So 200 ad the Romans used sauces to disguise the taste of the food

187
01:25:42,779 --> 01:25:44,850
possibly to

188
01:25:44,850 --> 01:25:48,720
Conceal doubtful freshness Wow

189
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:55,470
Really? I'm gonna say that can't be right. Is that wrong? What do you mean wrong? That's not real

190
01:25:55,470 --> 01:25:57,550
Is that why it's been getting deleted by the mods?

191
01:26:02,529 --> 01:26:10,060
Is that made up lore? All right, let me go back to paying attention to the game for a minute

192
01:26:12,439 --> 01:26:16,720
Who made the first sauce because every time you think about like who it was this you have to kind of go like well

193
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:17,600
Why?

194
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:23,399
You hunted you ate you planted this there's no reason to make one

195
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:42,359
This there was this hole. It was me was there already back here

196
01:26:42,359 --> 01:26:46,640
I got really confused after showing my fucking like whiteboard rant

197
01:26:47,439 --> 01:26:53,359
I don't think I have someone had heard the trebam's prayers after all

198
01:26:53,960 --> 01:27:01,039
If there was a flying serpent in this place, there might also be a temple and an elder to guide them

199
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:21,199
First sauce was invented by Ronald McDonald. It was ketchup. This is a new creature

200
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:33,430
You know what I'll tell you though, let's be fucking careful write shit down

201
01:27:33,989 --> 01:27:39,789
Make sure you're documenting things. We need to make sure we document history because in a thousand years

202
01:27:40,310 --> 01:27:47,680
Somebody might fucking think that do you understand this that like there's a there might be a point eventually a

203
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:53,239
Thousand two thousand years in the future where somebody's just like oh who made the first sauce? Oh, well, of course

204
01:27:53,239 --> 01:27:57,060
It was Ronald McDonald. This was God back in the

205
01:27:57,579 --> 01:28:03,539
Two thousand AD we got to be careful with how we documenting history and make sure we keep it accurate

206
01:28:03,539 --> 01:28:15,510
We got to make sure it's correct. The water can get really really muddy if we're not careful

207
01:28:16,149 --> 01:28:21,739
This is a different kind of fish. I try it. I'm gonna try it

208
01:28:29,180 --> 01:28:37,310
Electro skin allows a treban to create electrical discharges which can revive an ally. Um

209
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:43,510
I'm

210
01:28:45,069 --> 01:28:50,510
Everybody's freezing get out of the water get out of the water. Can I go in here? I'm electrified

211
01:28:51,069 --> 01:28:53,300
No, I'm not. Okay

212
01:28:53,300 --> 01:29:04,319
Get out of the water get out of the water

213
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:17,300
Get out of the water get out of the fucking water

214
01:29:17,859 --> 01:29:21,939
Wait, are they cold? I don't understand what's going on right now. Didn't I get one of the things?

215
01:29:22,699 --> 01:29:26,170
There wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm so confused

216
01:29:26,210 --> 01:29:31,840
I ate one of the I ate one of the fuzzy things and it went on everybody, right?

217
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:48,510
That was like five minutes ago. I don't you lost it when you got electro. What? Hold on a second. Wait a minute

218
01:29:48,510 --> 01:29:56,829
Wait a minute. Wait a minute

219
01:29:57,109 --> 01:29:59,109
They didn't all have it

220
01:29:59,149 --> 01:30:14,319
No, this is not right. Is it the cold water or whatever it is? I fucking don't know

221
01:30:14,439 --> 01:30:24,779
All right. Well, I gotta get out of here. I only need one to have it. Yeah, it's the water. Okay, it's the water

222
01:30:24,779 --> 01:30:27,460
I was gonna say like doesn't make any sense

223
01:30:27,859 --> 01:30:39,500
I don't think it's the water. Let's get out of here. You replace the one that actually had it

224
01:30:39,840 --> 01:31:25,020
Well, let me get the fuck out of here shit. Sorry, buddy. We gotta go. Oh my god, dude

225
01:31:25,220 --> 01:31:29,699
Like the hit the collision detection on some of these fucking rocks. I swear to God

226
01:31:30,300 --> 01:32:00,859
This is like the hardest thing I've had to do so far in the whole game. Okay, so somebody eat a fuzzy then

227
01:32:00,859 --> 01:32:16,460
What the fuck happened here? Everyone's still dying from the cold. Alright, so that's I guess that's my fault for I thought that if

228
01:32:16,899 --> 01:32:21,899
Somebody ate one that it just went on everybody and it did go on everybody

229
01:32:21,899 --> 01:32:25,699
But it comes off of everybody if the one person doesn't have it on I

230
01:32:28,699 --> 01:32:38,390
Okay, that what the fuck I how much but I what I thought they all had it

231
01:32:38,569 --> 01:32:43,779
So this guy didn't have it so they all don't have it fucking horse shit

232
01:32:49,810 --> 01:32:51,810
No, it's fine. I I

233
01:32:51,850 --> 01:33:11,020
Keeping this one. This guy has a electric skin. Well, we need to heal now only six. Oh

234
01:33:11,300 --> 01:33:20,569
It would have said somebody died didn't say anybody died. Oh my goodness

235
01:33:23,449 --> 01:33:27,090
Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Stop

236
01:33:27,890 --> 01:33:42,020
What what just what he rolled backwards? Why did he rolled backwards?

237
01:33:42,020 --> 01:33:47,180
I am fucking confused as you could ever be right now. He's dead

238
01:34:01,670 --> 01:34:06,909
Come on dude, get out of the way you piece of shit. Oh

239
01:34:11,159 --> 01:34:19,369
No, it's over. It's it actually is we're actually just fucked

240
01:34:19,369 --> 01:34:48,850
I don't even know who I who even died reload from or 20 minutes ago. No, but the game is designed

241
01:34:49,369 --> 01:34:51,689
You're not everybody doesn't get to stay

242
01:34:52,369 --> 01:35:10,380
Now what the fuck is happening? He spent 20 minutes talking about the sauce. It's fine. What are you?

243
01:35:10,579 --> 01:35:22,199
Why are you looking at this is that true true? I mean I did. All right. I did spend 20 minutes talking about sauce

244
01:35:22,199 --> 01:35:58,630
Oh, yeah, this is right here. We're good. Perhaps someone had heard the trebam's prayers after all

245
01:35:58,670 --> 01:35:59,270
All right

246
01:35:59,270 --> 01:36:01,670
So we're with a flying serpent in this place

247
01:36:01,829 --> 01:36:11,239
There might also be a temple and an elder to guide them. Okay, so same deal

248
01:36:11,239 --> 01:36:17,569
I wish I could just take one person having to take everybody is just so dangerous. Everybody's can die

249
01:36:18,329 --> 01:36:31,439
I want to get that powered though. So I'm just going in and going out and make it very easy very quick

250
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:46,619
I'm gonna make it simple. I'm not gonna put it on this one. I won't okay and that up this shit out of here

251
01:36:46,859 --> 01:36:49,619
No, don't know. I don't wanna

252
01:36:50,380 --> 01:36:59,350
Sorry, I don't like the buttons. I should just change them. They're just so fucked up

253
01:37:09,319 --> 01:37:16,319
Please raise your hand in the chat if B is always cancel or always like get back always no matter what

254
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:20,039
Or run it's sprint or back

255
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:33,329
To me B is never use item. It's back out of menu this to you

256
01:37:40,779 --> 01:37:54,680
Okay, let's go. Yeah, it says it. It doesn't matter if it says it

257
01:37:54,680 --> 01:38:02,979
It's built baked into 30 years of me playing video games. Just change to the menu

258
01:38:03,699 --> 01:38:24,260
Okay, let's get up. I can't save that one. They would don't do that shit again

259
01:38:25,060 --> 01:38:30,060
All right. Everything is back crisis averted. We talked about the sauce pretty cool. Let's go

260
01:38:30,060 --> 01:38:33,640
We have to find a way over here

261
01:38:33,640 --> 01:38:41,340
I do want somebody to eat this though, but not right now in fact get rid of this

262
01:38:41,340 --> 01:38:48,739
I don't want this fucking thing. I want to control who's the one that has

263
01:38:49,220 --> 01:38:57,479
No, it's you're the best one to be in control right now. All right, let's go. All right, don't I can get I'm gonna get electrocuted

264
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:03,529
I'm gonna go underneath

265
01:39:03,529 --> 01:39:19,500
Get those stakes stay away from that. All right, can I go under here?

266
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:32,489
Yep, is the temples under here? I got screwed last time

267
01:39:33,390 --> 01:39:58,840
Everybody in let's go. Huh? All right. Cool. We made it. So what was in here that I wanted to look at?

268
01:39:59,399 --> 01:40:06,060
How do you still have all of your powers?

269
01:40:06,779 --> 01:40:15,420
Holy shit, this dude is still stacked. All right, there's a balloon. Let me check the other areas though

270
01:40:24,720 --> 01:40:27,109
Okay, uh

271
01:40:27,109 --> 01:40:33,699
You I'll give this to a few people not everybody needs it

272
01:40:35,939 --> 01:40:40,850
Okay, you go, do you know

273
01:40:41,289 --> 01:40:48,729
No, do you know is the healer it'll be

274
01:40:52,189 --> 01:41:41,340
Laundry detergent here, you know what you take one of these two use this

275
01:41:42,060 --> 01:42:03,260
Okay, really pretty in here. Save the game. I didn't right when I walked in. Hmm. I need a square

276
01:42:03,819 --> 01:42:16,569
Square right here. We should be a square. I

277
01:42:17,130 --> 01:42:34,140
Think you do square. I love the graphics. Yeah, it's a very pretty game

278
01:42:34,340 --> 01:42:40,060
I'm at sick you watching it at 6,000 bitrate, even if you're at source

279
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
It probably does not do justice with how

280
01:42:43,439 --> 01:42:48,399
Very pretty the game is the game also has I think a different direct X mode. I'm on the default mode

281
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:54,500
Figured for streaming and probably easier, but yeah, it's pretty cool. Looks really nice

282
01:42:55,140 --> 01:43:30,539
Okay. Now we're gonna get around how I get over there. Can I go up further? I guess maybe I can make that

283
01:43:30,539 --> 01:43:36,229
Let's find out this looks like it keeps going

284
01:43:54,159 --> 01:44:21,779
Button zero, but I don't see anything over here

285
01:44:22,260 --> 01:44:31,829
This doesn't count as something does it oh wait, is it a button this is what you mean

286
01:44:32,189 --> 01:44:41,060
Hey friends, that wasn't what I needed to put in there. Was it I didn't just shoot that thing that has to go in there

287
01:44:41,060 --> 01:44:50,909
Right friends. That's how it just happened. Right now. I doubt that this is another one over here

288
01:44:51,430 --> 01:45:11,439
Come on. No way. All right. No way. Isn't it? That's just where the cube fits. No, I don't think so

289
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:15,439
I would be shocked if that's really what it was

290
01:45:15,439 --> 01:45:46,020
Well, what the hell it this way whoo, I didn't even see this. I'm sorry, buddy. I can't help you. I

291
01:45:53,619 --> 01:46:00,340
Really want to I really do that's a sad. Sorry, buddy. It's cold

292
01:46:00,340 --> 01:46:17,489
I know I wish I could give him a blanket or something or like a nice a couple of snakes or something

293
01:46:17,890 --> 01:46:19,890
What is this? Oh

294
01:46:19,890 --> 01:46:50,779
This time the discovery of a new statue and the knowledge it granted was not a surprise

295
01:46:50,779 --> 01:46:55,439
But a welcome sign that there was someone waiting for the Drebham

296
01:46:55,920 --> 01:47:01,340
As soon as they completed the trials, of course as was only appropriate

297
01:47:01,819 --> 01:47:04,460
Oh, I bet that unlocks. Um permanent upgrade

298
01:47:05,180 --> 01:47:07,659
Cool. All right. I need cube

299
01:47:10,699 --> 01:47:15,890
Where's cube? Where's voo?

300
01:47:16,449 --> 01:47:23,180
Come on, voo. Yeah, you need to get up here. Yeah fair complete the shrine

301
01:47:23,739 --> 01:47:35,460
Yeah fair. Come on up here. I need you right now

302
01:47:44,739 --> 01:48:02,829
Yeah fair come on up here. I need you right now you doofus

303
01:48:03,310 --> 01:48:18,189
Come on

304
01:48:18,189 --> 01:48:23,630
You what you are the best? Look it you always are on time. You always come immediately

305
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:28,079
This is look it i'll make sure you're staying alive

306
01:48:30,350 --> 01:48:55,869
You're always right behind me. God. Damn it. Get up here. Where are you?

307
01:48:57,949 --> 01:49:01,869
Just chilling down here in the water in the freezing cold water, by the way

308
01:49:09,710 --> 01:49:11,710
Oh my god, he's gonna die

309
01:49:11,949 --> 01:49:13,949
He's gonna drown

310
01:49:15,060 --> 01:49:18,100
Dude if you drown i'm gonna be very very upset

311
01:49:57,279 --> 01:49:59,229
Well

312
01:49:59,229 --> 01:50:07,329
I yeah, I guess I have to eat a cube but isn't the cube a body the cube is a body not a head, right?

313
01:50:07,649 --> 01:50:12,510
I don't know how it works essentially just bring a fruit up here

314
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:16,159
Yeah, I would try to avoid having to do that

315
01:50:17,729 --> 01:50:34,819
There's one over here though. Float is also body. Yeah, somebody else has to eat it up here then

316
01:50:40,579 --> 01:50:55,779
One of you has to eat it. Come on. Let's go. All right, let's try this one

317
01:50:56,260 --> 01:51:14,640
All right, who made it very very nice

318
01:51:15,439 --> 01:51:17,439
You get it because you're

319
01:51:17,600 --> 01:51:38,979
I ate it jump is b

320
01:51:39,390 --> 01:51:41,760
interact is x

321
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:58,560
Eat is a I want interact to be x roll is x interact is y eat is b

322
01:51:59,279 --> 01:52:03,649
I don't like it. Yeah, I don't really like any of these

323
01:52:04,130 --> 01:52:14,850
I'll keep it stuff to get used to it. So what's down here?

324
01:52:35,489 --> 01:52:37,539
Very nice

325
01:52:37,539 --> 01:52:44,689
This area is kind of big i've been playing with a different layout

326
01:52:44,770 --> 01:52:46,770
Yeah, I was playing with pc controls and then

327
01:52:47,569 --> 01:52:51,970
I decided to use controller today game like this

328
01:52:51,970 --> 01:52:59,819
I probably should have used controller to begin with pretty much any third person game. I prefer on um controller

329
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:05,199
Walking around with the analog to me is better than walking around with w

330
01:53:05,920 --> 01:53:09,279
And the mouse and like ad. Ooh, what's up?

331
01:53:14,210 --> 01:53:22,989
New mutation. No, wait, somebody can turn this into like a bomb or something, right?

332
01:53:23,310 --> 01:53:48,460
What are your thoughts on your dog? Is he a good boy? Do you let him cook? What I

333
01:53:49,260 --> 01:53:57,939
Yeah, I guess I think so. Where's my um, where's my offense?

334
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:28,579
This is I don't remember. This is electricity skin. You do it. You missed all of them now that that's the fish

335
01:54:28,659 --> 01:54:42,380
What is this one? Oh, it's sticky sticky. Okay, jesus

336
01:54:42,460 --> 01:54:49,659
This looks intense deep in their memory that trebum carried a fragment of knowledge about this temple

337
01:54:50,779 --> 01:54:56,130
It had once been a place of learning where wise trebum came to study the crystals

338
01:54:56,899 --> 01:55:03,390
Which which but the memory was incomplete what happened?

339
01:55:05,069 --> 01:55:08,210
What happened to us?

340
01:55:13,819 --> 01:55:16,140
All right. Uh, this is gonna be fun

341
01:55:16,859 --> 01:55:33,869
Wish me luck

342
01:55:33,869 --> 01:55:35,649
nice

343
01:55:35,649 --> 01:55:37,649
Not gonna dump me

344
01:55:45,760 --> 01:55:48,399
Bod watchers skip an hour. I don't think so

345
01:56:04,579 --> 01:56:09,859
Oh, I wanted to do it so bad. Fuck. It's all right. I just should have been patient. That's my own fault

346
01:56:10,180 --> 01:56:12,180
I should have been patient and I wasn't

347
01:56:13,220 --> 01:56:15,140
It's not gonna take an hour

348
01:56:15,140 --> 01:56:17,460
It's not vod watchers. I don't have to skip an hour. I'm good

349
01:56:18,180 --> 01:56:47,300
I got it. I got it. I got it

350
01:56:47,380 --> 01:56:49,699
Fuck no. Okay, relax. I'm

351
01:56:55,569 --> 01:56:58,449
He's doing it because of the highlight channel. No, I'm not

352
01:56:59,090 --> 01:57:01,890
I just have no I just I hate being patient

353
01:57:06,479 --> 01:57:09,359
It's so funny. It really is. I hate it so much

354
01:57:10,640 --> 01:57:14,960
In the so I want to get through this fast. I don't want to sit here for this one second

355
01:57:15,600 --> 01:57:17,600
This is an eternity to me

356
01:57:18,050 --> 01:57:21,250
That right there that was my it may as well have been 100 years

357
01:57:25,819 --> 01:57:29,739
But if I had just done it normally the first time it would have taken five times less time

358
01:57:33,060 --> 01:57:38,430
Like if I have to stand still in a game or in real life, it may as well be 500 years sitting still

359
01:57:42,899 --> 01:57:44,899
That's genuine. I really I mean that

360
01:57:45,220 --> 01:58:22,670
See this is what I know a lot of people like oh man, you should play

361
01:58:23,229 --> 01:58:26,189
You know like getting over it or no. No, I did that

362
01:58:27,539 --> 01:58:30,100
And I got maybe I think halfway up the level

363
01:58:30,899 --> 01:58:32,659
And I thought I was at the end

364
01:58:32,659 --> 01:58:37,220
And when I looked over the chat and they said omega l you're only 40% of the way through the game

365
01:58:37,220 --> 01:58:42,399
I never turned it on ever again. This is a while. I'm never doing this again

366
01:58:50,909 --> 01:58:52,909
Jesus. Um, okay

367
01:58:52,989 --> 01:58:58,060
What's the plan here?

368
01:58:58,060 --> 01:58:59,340
uh

369
01:58:59,340 --> 01:59:01,420
Um, I think I have to drop

370
01:59:02,380 --> 01:59:04,880
down like

371
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:07,920
Oh my goodness. That's not what I had to do at all, but I

372
01:59:09,149 --> 01:59:10,750
Somehow made it work

373
01:59:10,750 --> 01:59:40,590
We're always comparing the eternal cylinder puzzle to getting over it

374
01:59:40,989 --> 01:59:46,260
No, i'm just saying I don't have very much patience for I don't have patience

375
01:59:46,899 --> 02:00:05,260
That sounds like a you problem

376
02:00:05,260 --> 02:00:06,989
Yeah, it is

377
02:00:06,989 --> 02:00:09,899
We're all very different

378
02:00:09,899 --> 02:00:12,460
Sorry

379
02:00:12,460 --> 02:00:18,020
I thought I didn't make it

380
02:00:18,020 --> 02:00:27,340
That's some interesting shit right there. Whatever. This is who should eat this

381
02:00:28,909 --> 02:01:00,270
You I don't know gunu. I feel like gunu does not have anything. I'm giving it to guno. Nice part two

382
02:01:00,510 --> 02:01:09,260
There is a part two, but hold on

383
02:01:09,899 --> 02:01:15,659
Okay, this is gonna be interesting. I need I can't uh that I cannot save if they look at all these crunchies here

384
02:01:16,140 --> 02:01:18,180
It's probably bad idea

385
02:01:18,180 --> 02:01:23,569
But i'm i'm about to reset the whole i'm about to reset the whole thing. I'm about to reset the whole thing

386
02:01:23,649 --> 02:01:25,010
No, i'm not i'm good

387
02:01:25,010 --> 02:01:26,850
Can I breathe in?

388
02:01:26,850 --> 02:01:28,529
While being stuck I can

389
02:01:28,529 --> 02:01:46,000
All right, it's gonna face the right way

390
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,159
You can still suck while stuck. Yep

391
02:01:48,720 --> 02:02:01,579
Someone tells me you shouldn't be snorting the random shit on the walls, but whatever

392
02:02:01,899 --> 02:02:14,109
I have this game, but you got way further than I did

393
02:02:18,109 --> 02:02:28,239
I think it's just a test of almost would but we're good. You're gonna get lead poisoning

394
02:02:30,189 --> 02:02:45,890
This is definitely worth it even though it's taken a while

395
02:02:46,449 --> 02:02:55,409
Sometimes being impatient pays off like right there

396
02:02:55,810 --> 02:02:59,220
Uh, there was like a 10 to 20 chance that I actually make that

397
02:02:59,779 --> 02:03:02,850
But I did so we're good

398
02:03:15,119 --> 02:03:17,279
Okay, so that's it

399
02:03:18,079 --> 02:03:20,159
I just gotta go backwards now

400
02:03:23,600 --> 02:03:26,159
It was worth it. I got what three gems

401
02:03:42,560 --> 02:03:45,340
Stink bugs are cute

402
02:03:45,340 --> 02:03:46,859
Oh, I have a bug story

403
02:03:46,859 --> 02:03:56,590
Good thing I fell

404
02:03:56,590 --> 02:04:07,779
All right. So here's the bug story

405
02:04:07,779 --> 02:04:11,550
I got it. I'm good. I'm good

406
02:04:12,829 --> 02:04:19,550
You know what I want

407
02:04:19,550 --> 02:04:21,550
I'm actually probably going to get

408
02:04:23,680 --> 02:04:29,279
Some of you guys are gonna pog some people are gonna be like, whoa. Oh, I know what that is. That's cool, man. That's cool

409
02:04:31,699 --> 02:04:33,380
I'm going to

410
02:04:33,380 --> 02:04:38,029
If I can i'm going to get

411
02:04:39,579 --> 02:04:41,579
Maybe like three four

412
02:04:43,380 --> 02:04:45,380
And like a little enclosure

413
02:04:47,710 --> 02:04:53,380
What's he gonna say

414
02:04:53,380 --> 02:04:58,239
blue death fainting beetles

415
02:04:58,239 --> 02:05:07,840
Have you ever seen one? I'm at the very bottom. Oh, I looked over a chat. That's fucking whatever

416
02:05:11,439 --> 02:05:14,960
I want to get a little enclosure and have some little blue death fainting beetles

417
02:05:16,350 --> 02:05:18,350
If you don't know what they are go look them up

418
02:05:18,750 --> 02:05:23,069
They look like the elden ring beetles. They're this bright blue

419
02:05:23,869 --> 02:05:26,899
There are crunchies in the corner

420
02:05:26,899 --> 02:05:31,949
People shit or do you mean that?

421
02:05:33,649 --> 02:05:35,649
Wait, what do you mean in here?

422
02:05:36,609 --> 02:05:39,579
I missed crunchies

423
02:05:39,579 --> 02:05:41,180
On the bottom you mean

424
02:05:41,180 --> 02:05:48,430
other corner

425
02:05:48,430 --> 02:05:50,430
Holy shit, this is a lot too

426
02:05:50,590 --> 02:05:54,529
That's like a two that's one full crystal writer

427
02:05:56,590 --> 02:06:00,029
Actually worth it. All right. Let's actually get to the top of this damn thing

428
02:06:00,829 --> 02:06:11,810
Yeah, they're apparently one of the easiest things in the in the world to take care of

429
02:06:18,130 --> 02:06:21,810
And they live do you want to how long blue death fainting beetles last?

430
02:06:22,689 --> 02:06:24,689
nice super villain pet choice

431
02:06:25,789 --> 02:06:28,100
Ow

432
02:06:29,300 --> 02:06:31,300
My my beetles

433
02:06:36,689 --> 02:06:39,649
I let them like walk over my fingers dash the beetles

434
02:06:40,750 --> 02:06:42,750
You know about the blue death fainting beetle

435
02:06:44,289 --> 02:06:47,649
That's like that. That's a monologue moment where like the villain is explaining something

436
02:06:53,310 --> 02:06:57,069
Uh, hold on

437
02:06:57,069 --> 02:07:02,029
Yeah, so blue death fainting beetles can live I think up to eight to ten years

438
02:07:03,810 --> 02:07:06,449
And they're just happy little creatures

439
02:07:07,470 --> 02:07:08,510
they eat

440
02:07:08,510 --> 02:07:14,319
Carrots like grapes and stuff. They're just like little and they're they're not little they're pretty large

441
02:07:16,800 --> 02:07:19,760
They're they're apparently incredibly simple to take care of

442
02:07:20,560 --> 02:07:24,319
You just need an enclosure. You just need some like sand and shit

443
02:07:24,960 --> 02:07:28,420
I would want to make it nice and fun and make sure that's in the room

444
02:07:28,979 --> 02:07:45,949
What are you gonna name them? I don't know. I need to get them first

445
02:07:46,989 --> 02:07:50,800
They're apparently pretty social too

446
02:07:50,800 --> 02:08:01,310
That's why they say getting a few they can they get along with some other uh other insects, too

447
02:08:02,029 --> 02:08:04,930
I don't think I would do multiple. They just were kind of cute looking

448
02:08:11,329 --> 02:08:12,770
They do look

449
02:08:12,770 --> 02:08:15,569
Just like the elden ring dung beetle though. They really do

450
02:08:19,760 --> 02:08:26,930
I'm just a friend. Can we get a beetle cam?

451
02:08:28,100 --> 02:08:30,100
That might be kind of fun. Actually

452
02:08:30,100 --> 02:08:33,760
All right, I could blow up. I'm gonna blow this so I gotta be careful

453
02:08:34,319 --> 02:08:37,470
Is anything on the is anything on the ground? Yep. Wait

454
02:08:38,270 --> 02:08:39,390
I don't care

455
02:08:39,390 --> 02:08:46,899
I'm getting it a little beetle cam

456
02:08:58,529 --> 02:09:02,430
Okay, that's it

457
02:09:02,430 --> 02:09:04,430
live beetle reaction

458
02:09:04,510 --> 02:09:11,840
Uh recently I kind of like you can call me bug andy if you want

459
02:09:14,770 --> 02:09:16,770
I don't know. It's kind of like a new

460
02:09:16,850 --> 02:09:18,850
I don't want to say hobby but

461
02:09:19,010 --> 02:09:23,699
There's a lot of really really crazy beetles and insects and stuff like scarabs

462
02:09:23,699 --> 02:09:26,659
Have you seen some of the scarabs that look like fucking jewels?

463
02:09:29,119 --> 02:09:30,640
They're remarkable

464
02:09:30,640 --> 02:09:32,939
They actually are

465
02:09:32,939 --> 02:09:34,939
Some of them are they like

466
02:09:35,659 --> 02:09:37,659
Made out of they look like they have chrome

467
02:09:38,140 --> 02:09:39,630
skin

468
02:09:39,630 --> 02:09:41,869
They look like emeralds and stuff. It's really really interesting

469
02:09:43,090 --> 02:09:45,090
Bro has been watching the mummy

470
02:09:45,409 --> 02:09:52,220
No, I haven't

471
02:09:52,220 --> 02:09:56,220
Yeah, so I mean, uh, I watched the mummy recently and now I want bugs

472
02:10:01,180 --> 02:10:17,630
Oh, we found somebody the elder was sad to hear the story of the trebum and their failed journey behind the cylinder

473
02:10:18,350 --> 02:10:20,350
You have been through so much

474
02:10:20,909 --> 02:10:24,270
I wish I did not have to place even greater burdens upon you

475
02:10:24,829 --> 02:10:29,390
But we trebum are not meant to live in this cold and cruel place

476
02:10:30,109 --> 02:10:32,109
You must continue your voyage

477
02:10:32,430 --> 02:10:36,670
You must cross the waters and reach the ancient lands of the desert

478
02:10:37,149 --> 02:10:39,949
There lies the only hope for our people

479
02:10:40,829 --> 02:10:49,550
You see we trebum once had the means to sing to the stars and build vessels that allowed us to dance in the heavens

480
02:10:50,350 --> 02:10:57,869
Seek one of these floating palaces. They may be the key to finding salvation in these times of despair

481
02:10:58,109 --> 02:11:03,149
Oh shit. Yeah, we we gotta we gotta recap somebody here. May we meet again someday?

482
02:11:03,869 --> 02:11:08,189
Somebody said hey, well wait bro, you went beyond the cylinder

483
02:11:09,010 --> 02:11:15,430
We did we did and it was it was mind-blowing

484
02:11:16,880 --> 02:11:23,489
We went to this weird astral heaven world and i'm not making this up. It actually happened. I go check it out

485
02:11:23,810 --> 02:11:25,390
Go check it out

486
02:11:25,390 --> 02:11:37,220
All right, so I gotta find this floating thing in the sky. That's just super food. It's just one. Oh, there were two

487
02:11:39,060 --> 02:11:41,739
Cool. All right. So let me get out of here now

488
02:11:42,220 --> 02:11:52,560
I got 16 rocks here. Yeah, I don't know something about bugs

489
02:11:53,199 --> 02:11:56,850
You want let's get real. Let's get real. Why not?

490
02:11:57,409 --> 02:11:59,359
Come on

491
02:11:59,359 --> 02:12:05,119
I feel like we kind of treat a lot of insects like they're just random pieces of shit and they're just like meaningless

492
02:12:05,760 --> 02:12:14,350
Like oh bug who cares crush it who gives a shit, right? There are a lot of really remarkable

493
02:12:15,649 --> 02:12:18,689
kind of animals in like the insect world that I think we kind of just

494
02:12:19,489 --> 02:12:20,770
Blossom over

495
02:12:20,770 --> 02:12:30,289
Now don't get me wrong. There are a lot of bugs that are just pieces of absolute dog shit

496
02:12:36,289 --> 02:12:41,729
Like there are some bugs that are just like oh fuck you. You know what I mean? Like ticks

497
02:12:43,100 --> 02:12:50,750
Murder hornets like horribly aggressive wasps and yellow jacket. No, no, no, no. I'm not talking about that

498
02:12:53,090 --> 02:12:55,869
Don't hurt us, please

499
02:12:55,869 --> 02:12:58,189
What the that scared the shit out of me?

500
02:12:59,680 --> 02:13:03,260
Is he all right? I thought he was gone. All right, I need to heal

501
02:13:03,979 --> 02:13:05,100
That actually

502
02:13:05,100 --> 02:13:08,220
Oh, no, I activated it. Oh, okay. We gotta go

503
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,079
I don't know what direction I gotta go from here. All right writer

504
02:13:19,439 --> 02:13:21,439
Feel like a cockroach. Yeah

505
02:13:23,710 --> 02:13:30,189
Well, the thing is I see cockroaches. I mean it like flies they are they have a very important part of our ecosystem

506
02:13:34,399 --> 02:13:35,960
like

507
02:13:35,960 --> 02:13:37,960
Decomposing decomposition, right?

508
02:13:38,300 --> 02:13:42,430
Let me get safe here for a second

509
02:13:48,619 --> 02:13:50,619
Oh boy

510
02:13:51,260 --> 02:13:53,579
No

511
02:13:53,579 --> 02:13:54,779
Whee wham

512
02:13:54,779 --> 02:14:00,770
Who was whee wham? Oh, no, he's so sad

513
02:14:07,380 --> 02:14:12,689
Whee wham, where are you going? Don't go that way. Where are you going? Why are you going over there?

514
02:14:13,489 --> 02:14:15,489
Why is he going over there? What's his problem?

515
02:14:16,130 --> 02:14:20,449
What's his problem?

516
02:14:20,449 --> 02:14:27,500
Do not do that

517
02:14:27,500 --> 02:14:28,770
What are we?

518
02:14:28,770 --> 02:14:30,770
What is his problem?

519
02:14:37,710 --> 02:14:39,789
Jesus

520
02:14:39,789 --> 02:14:41,149
uh

521
02:14:41,149 --> 02:15:04,210
Okay, we need to figure out what just happened. It's okay. I have a lot we can we can upgrade reload

522
02:15:05,859 --> 02:15:13,569
No was we was we won the trumpet guy the dead one was the mixer

523
02:15:14,050 --> 02:15:23,659
Oh, we can't yeah, we can't live without we won

524
02:15:35,979 --> 02:15:41,260
In fact, I need to control we won because we won the one that actually can hurt people. All right now

525
02:15:41,979 --> 02:15:47,699
Before I blow this turn around save scum

526
02:15:48,340 --> 02:15:57,840
Yeah, that's fine. All right. Are we good? Let's eat. Yeah, it's okay to save scum

527
02:15:58,779 --> 02:16:16,430
Wait, we didn't know what this does eat it minerals can process minerals

528
02:16:19,020 --> 02:16:20,560
Interesting so

529
02:16:20,560 --> 02:16:24,000
The crystals I get it. All right. Well, let's get to a safe spot here

530
02:16:25,359 --> 02:16:33,200
Wait to go yet. So all those red and blue crystals

531
02:16:35,420 --> 02:16:45,120
Can be processed by that now. Okay, who's in here vegan vegan

532
02:16:45,600 --> 02:17:15,629
Okay, even if I find an egg, I can't hatch it right now. Anyways, leave them. I have to there's an egg here

533
02:17:18,620 --> 02:17:20,299
I i'm gonna

534
02:17:20,299 --> 02:17:22,299
can I

535
02:17:22,299 --> 02:17:32,620
Can I bring the egg? I don't think I can bring it i'll try because there's a

536
02:17:33,260 --> 02:17:47,309
Upgrade temple over there. I'm gonna there's no way. I'm sorry, bro. You're you're dead

537
02:18:07,940 --> 02:18:13,459
I can light it on fire with my trunk. The problem is we can't put him in the party because I only have six or seven slots

538
02:18:14,020 --> 02:18:26,850
So we can't he cannot join. Okay, much cleaner than last time

539
02:18:31,940 --> 02:18:36,000
All right. The next thing we've got here

540
02:18:36,479 --> 02:18:46,559
Is this coming up next? We got the temple here I can upgrade

541
02:18:47,200 --> 02:18:48,639
Which is perfect

542
02:18:48,639 --> 02:18:53,190
Plenty of food. I got my party. I got the mineral processor

543
02:18:54,500 --> 02:18:56,500
Which there's gonna be a ton of crystals in this cave

544
02:18:56,819 --> 02:19:01,579
What's the cube do?

545
02:19:01,579 --> 02:19:03,579
Cube can fit into cube slots

546
02:19:04,829 --> 02:19:05,709
only

547
02:19:05,709 --> 02:19:09,520
Somebody that has the cube mutation could fit into a cube slot

548
02:19:10,590 --> 02:19:13,469
Which allows to open some doors

549
02:19:21,659 --> 02:19:26,120
All right. I got a lot of money. It's time to make some real decisions

550
02:19:27,219 --> 02:19:29,219
We're gonna have probably 20 crystals

551
02:19:30,180 --> 02:19:48,930
Excuse me lots of crystals in here. In fact, let's start this what I wonder what does it turn it into I wonder

552
02:19:49,489 --> 02:19:55,549
What do you do? Okay a bunch of crystals pick up everything

553
02:19:56,190 --> 02:20:00,989
Let's make food

554
02:20:00,989 --> 02:20:06,110
I wonder it takes a while

555
02:20:06,510 --> 02:20:08,989
It's not as fast as um, some of the other shit

556
02:20:09,629 --> 02:20:29,569
What does it do?

557
02:20:29,569 --> 02:20:31,809
Oh, it gives you crystal dust

558
02:20:35,659 --> 02:20:37,180
That's pretty good

559
02:20:37,180 --> 02:20:39,489
How much does it give I didn't see?

560
02:20:44,860 --> 02:20:46,860
Holy shit, that gives a lot

561
02:20:46,860 --> 02:20:48,159
That's a

562
02:20:48,159 --> 02:20:49,920
That's a lot

563
02:20:49,920 --> 02:21:06,180
Wait, should I eat this? I'm gonna eat it. Okay

564
02:21:24,059 --> 02:21:34,450
I feel like it's gonna be a lot the attractive crystal. I think it's gonna be a lot

565
02:21:35,069 --> 02:21:40,129
You should break it first. Maybe I don't think I should I wonder because it's it counts as a crystal right now

566
02:21:40,610 --> 02:21:47,940
All right. We definitely need leadership. I know i'm doing that for a fact

567
02:21:48,500 --> 02:21:58,319
Maybe the stamina wheel give orange meteors to smelt

568
02:22:01,120 --> 02:22:23,920
Did I miss any um crunchies water storage? I feel like the water is not a problem. All right, let's do leadership

569
02:22:24,159 --> 02:22:48,930
Try to do it again. We're gonna have nine give the orange meteorite. Oh, you're right

570
02:22:49,579 --> 02:22:53,100
Yes, you are. Absolutely right. I've been holding on to these things for a long time

571
02:22:54,459 --> 02:23:00,260
Oh, yep, this guy look at how long it's taking too. All right, we're doing it again

572
02:23:06,340 --> 02:23:10,100
Now I can actually get more people and i'm probably gonna get more from this shit

573
02:23:10,340 --> 02:23:14,370
Can you summarize this game in 15 words or less? Yeah, sure

574
02:23:16,129 --> 02:23:20,770
Little creatures on a planet being destroyed by a huge rolling pin

575
02:23:21,840 --> 02:23:23,819
Must find a way

576
02:23:23,819 --> 02:23:27,260
To activate their memories to figure out why this is happening

577
02:23:28,190 --> 02:23:36,739
And what the heck's going on behind that cylinder? There you go

578
02:23:38,399 --> 02:23:42,829
All right. I want to I i'm we're gonna wait this out because I want to I bet you I get a lot from this

579
02:23:47,549 --> 02:24:07,409
Bro, who made the first sauce? This is gonna take a while health stem. How much is stamina wheel?

580
02:24:08,739 --> 02:24:11,579
All right. I'm doing stamina wheel and

581
02:24:13,200 --> 02:24:24,159
Look at how many more crystals are up here. Look at all of them. I need them all. Holy shit

582
02:24:24,159 --> 02:24:26,959
There's so many crystals. How do I I need to get all of these every single one?

583
02:24:26,959 --> 02:24:40,319
I'm not leaving till I have them all who has the inflating head you do come here. Give me that way

584
02:24:40,639 --> 02:25:30,940
I can't get up there. Can we shoot them down with water? Come on. I need more of those crystals. Yes float up there

585
02:25:31,260 --> 02:26:30,639
Look at all these come over here get another smelter. I could double it up. You're gonna be a smelter

586
02:26:30,879 --> 02:26:52,860
How much was that? All right smelter. Come here. Where did it go right? This is really fun. It is pretty fun

587
02:26:53,180 --> 02:27:19,760
I very much enjoy it. Okay, how much is this gonna go for nine? Well, that was worth it. Holy shit. Okay

588
02:27:20,239 --> 02:27:34,059
Stamina wheel, I don't know if I'll be able to get anything else. There's more crystals over on the corner

589
02:27:34,059 --> 02:28:19,870
I think there are more come on dislodge these that should be enough to do one more thing with the

590
02:28:20,430 --> 02:28:31,489
Meteorite, uh, there's water in the middle. What should I do? Can you stomp them down? Uh,

591
02:28:32,129 --> 02:28:37,500
Maybe maybe I can like blow them out of the wall

592
02:28:39,170 --> 02:28:40,930
All right, you can't really aim

593
02:28:40,930 --> 02:29:03,020
So i'm just gonna I think these ones are way too lodged in I'd have to jump all the way up

594
02:29:04,420 --> 02:29:22,909
Maybe here we go. All right, i'll give these to the other one. I missed a raid shit. I missed ramala

595
02:29:23,149 --> 02:29:30,459
That's from a long time ago. Oh shit. I'm sorry a lot of people you're still here. Thanks for this. Uh, thanks

596
02:29:30,540 --> 02:29:35,389
I just said thanks for the stream. Well, thanks for the stream. Well, you were streaming. Thanks for that stream

597
02:29:38,049 --> 02:29:47,139
Thanks for the stream. Okay you process these

598
02:30:11,059 --> 02:30:29,739
Process now, let's go talk. I'm sorry. I'm so I am so anal about this

599
02:30:29,819 --> 02:30:38,340
I just want every single one of them projection shared a new recipe with the trebum

600
02:30:38,819 --> 02:30:43,659
Which could protect them from the cruel light of their enemies. Thank god

601
02:30:47,520 --> 02:30:52,989
Oh, that's not what it is. It's a small flame

602
02:30:53,389 --> 02:31:08,850
I thought I had one of these like jawbreakers. I guess not didn't I have one of those somebody does

603
02:31:10,020 --> 02:31:34,350
I think one of the other people has one what I said anal. I've never heard that phrase before

604
02:31:34,590 --> 02:31:59,840
Have you never heard that phrase you want about have you never heard that before? All right, I

605
02:32:00,479 --> 02:32:09,489
Okay, uh, i'm waiting for this to be completely processed. We're at seven now. Perfect

606
02:32:12,120 --> 02:32:16,379
Digested food is seven. I think it's probably a good idea. But what hold on is anything else?

607
02:32:16,379 --> 02:32:23,520
I didn't I don't think I upgraded something once that's stamina. I just did it. Is water am I neglecting water?

608
02:32:23,600 --> 02:32:32,540
Is it bad? Maybe I shouldn't

609
02:32:33,500 --> 02:32:42,639
I feel like I have to do it at least once it's level one. Um

610
02:32:51,420 --> 02:32:56,620
People are gonna freak out. Hey, but it's all right. I got two crystal processors now. We're gonna be fine

611
02:32:57,020 --> 02:33:04,850
I haven't upgraded water once it's probably gonna be a problem soon. All right

612
02:33:06,850 --> 02:33:08,850
I am ready

613
02:33:11,219 --> 02:33:17,709
I do need three crystals to make this thing and I think there's a jawbreaker in my storage

614
02:33:18,110 --> 02:33:35,870
So I think we're good. Everyone's healthy. Everyone's happy got plenty of food. Let's go the apparitions spoke to the trebum

615
02:33:36,850 --> 02:33:40,370
Do not leave this cave without extracting its riches

616
02:33:40,930 --> 02:33:48,879
It said the walls hide valuable minerals necessary for our recipes and other important matters

617
02:33:49,889 --> 02:33:57,629
Now while the common trebum has no way of processing them our crafty ancestors created a mutation

618
02:33:58,250 --> 02:34:06,000
Capable of performing such a task the apparition faded and the trebum was sad

619
02:34:07,229 --> 02:34:14,350
It was almost like losing one of their elders. Oh, that's not okay. He's sad sad

620
02:34:17,760 --> 02:34:42,930
Need three stones. They're in every single one of those caves. All right, where to no more points of interest

621
02:34:43,329 --> 02:35:03,659
This is gonna be weird though. I'm gonna go to the other side of this. Yeah. All right, it's over there

622
02:35:05,870 --> 02:35:08,500
all right, I gotta get the right spot and

623
02:35:29,170 --> 02:35:34,579
This one's quick. Uh-oh. Uh-oh

624
02:35:36,129 --> 02:36:06,479
Uh-oh had to cut a few of these corners here. I think i'm good. Okay, everybody through

625
02:36:11,250 --> 02:36:19,870
We did it. Aha

626
02:36:20,350 --> 02:36:38,479
There's no light coming off of it. No point of interest. We might be able to find a few friends

627
02:36:47,899 --> 02:37:09,409
Interesting. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I haven't really figured out the deal with these are is there a deal or is it just what was this?

628
02:37:10,159 --> 02:37:16,579
Curiously a creature. It did not resemble the servants of the cylinder, but somehow it seemed oddly

629
02:37:17,200 --> 02:37:22,899
Menacing and what was that thing pulsating beneath it? The heart is a friend

630
02:37:23,459 --> 02:37:26,260
Something in the trebam's ancient memories made them

631
02:37:26,879 --> 02:37:28,020
apprehensive

632
02:37:28,100 --> 02:37:47,229
Okay, it is pumping the heart was beating slowly

633
02:37:47,870 --> 02:37:49,870
And the creature was asleep

634
02:37:50,659 --> 02:38:10,579
Could it be that the cold was keeping the creature frozen in this strange slumber? Oh, they're all scared

635
02:38:11,059 --> 02:38:24,350
What if I do this? Hi

636
02:38:24,930 --> 02:38:26,290
Are you okay?

637
02:38:26,290 --> 02:38:45,069
Wait, uh, I don't know. Do I have to fill it up? Maybe I have to fill it maybe to fill it up

638
02:38:47,600 --> 02:38:53,680
The warmer it got the more the monstrous creature seemed to start losing control of its body

639
02:38:54,639 --> 02:38:56,639
That must be its weakness

640
02:38:56,959 --> 02:38:58,879
All right warmth

641
02:38:58,879 --> 02:39:02,100
Warm

642
02:39:02,100 --> 02:39:03,620
Oh shit

643
02:39:03,620 --> 02:39:23,969
Is everybody all right? Who needs help? I think I need to heal all right back it up back it up back it up

644
02:39:24,530 --> 02:39:36,129
Where's my fire? That's the right idea. All right fire

645
02:39:36,770 --> 02:40:01,139
Come here fire breathe the fire. Ow

646
02:40:03,600 --> 02:40:09,010
Someone's there

647
02:40:09,010 --> 02:40:17,379
Got it. You get the fuck away from me. That's a heart now. I can eat that

648
02:40:18,020 --> 02:40:20,079
Get out of here

649
02:40:20,079 --> 02:40:22,079
Get out of here get out of here

650
02:40:22,479 --> 02:40:24,479
Stop get out of here

651
02:40:25,280 --> 02:40:30,159
I don't know what the hell that is, but we're gonna I gotta move though because this fucking annoying thing is just

652
02:40:34,959 --> 02:40:38,799
Leave me alone. Nobody has a horn

653
02:40:42,639 --> 02:40:45,700
Okay, let me just double check make sure that's not over here

654
02:40:46,260 --> 02:40:48,610
What about this shit?

655
02:40:48,610 --> 02:40:50,370
This looks fucking cool

656
02:40:50,370 --> 02:40:58,540
More fire. I'm gonna oh

657
02:40:59,100 --> 02:41:05,469
All right. All right. All right. Hold on. I feel like there's something with these

658
02:41:07,649 --> 02:41:09,649
Right like there's got to be something I can do with this

659
02:41:15,790 --> 02:41:17,389
Stomp them

660
02:41:17,389 --> 02:41:26,540
Yeah, that worked. But did they drop anything?

661
02:41:29,489 --> 02:41:33,840
They don't oh I hear one

662
02:41:33,840 --> 02:41:36,479
Okay, shit's dangerous. Who should eat this?

663
02:41:41,540 --> 02:41:47,299
I don't know what this is gonna do. Maybe you in the middle here

664
02:41:49,180 --> 02:41:58,270
Um go one give it to gunu gunu. I if this is a body. I don't I guess we do have an extra smelter

665
02:41:58,590 --> 02:42:14,139
Yeah, there's still there's an extra smelter. All right, let's try it. I don't want to craft these but you know, that's

666
02:42:14,540 --> 02:42:18,700
As long as I have one somebody else has to hold on to these

667
02:42:26,219 --> 02:42:50,290
You know you hold on to that energy bomb. Okay gunu. I want to truth regenerating body

668
02:43:01,120 --> 02:43:15,500
Somebody should take this too. We need a horn very important. Okay

669
02:43:16,139 --> 02:43:42,319
Very very cool. So that was the big thing here. Anything else? Let me get some food. Gunu sucks

670
02:43:43,139 --> 02:43:47,420
What no, he doesn't. All right, it's straight and then right

671
02:44:17,709 --> 02:44:26,350
I got time you get somebody

672
02:44:29,229 --> 02:44:31,229
Oh, I spent too much time

673
02:44:31,870 --> 02:44:36,430
Trying to blow the horn against that. They're all dead. Everybody's dead. We're all fucking dead, man

674
02:44:37,069 --> 02:44:38,430
We're dead

675
02:44:38,430 --> 02:44:40,350
We're dead

676
02:44:40,350 --> 02:44:42,350
Everybody's gonna die

677
02:44:42,409 --> 02:44:44,409
Everybody's gonna die

678
02:44:46,110 --> 02:44:58,879
It's all right, we're good this time don't even blow the horn

679
02:45:45,950 --> 02:45:50,430
I think I got it

680
02:45:55,489 --> 02:45:57,489
Come on

681
02:45:57,489 --> 02:46:00,239
Ayayay

682
02:46:00,239 --> 02:46:07,709
We made it dangerous

683
02:46:07,709 --> 02:46:13,569
Beware the voice of their memories cried out the mathematician has been summoned

684
02:46:14,639 --> 02:46:17,120
This place was no longer safe. What do we do?

685
02:46:19,020 --> 02:46:21,020
He's pulling it out with his hands

686
02:46:22,850 --> 02:46:25,739
Is that what does that do? What does that mean for us?

687
02:46:26,620 --> 02:46:39,860
Did you get it? You got it? Okay, it's gonna be lightning shit

688
02:46:45,700 --> 02:46:47,700
Is it lightning or is it not?

689
02:46:48,020 --> 02:46:50,129
It's just going

690
02:46:50,129 --> 02:46:51,170
uh

691
02:46:51,170 --> 02:46:52,430
Okay

692
02:46:52,430 --> 02:46:59,700
Why am I standing around because a lot sometimes it's purple and

693
02:47:00,659 --> 02:47:04,559
You have to stay near it, but I guess that's not the case right now

694
02:47:05,440 --> 02:47:06,799
No

695
02:47:06,799 --> 02:47:09,229
There's an egg. What the fuck?

696
02:47:20,829 --> 02:47:22,829
That's so far away

697
02:47:41,950 --> 02:47:54,819
Come on, come on, come on

698
02:48:08,370 --> 02:48:10,799
Everybody make it

699
02:48:11,840 --> 02:48:14,719
I think we're good

700
02:48:14,719 --> 02:48:19,200
We got it

701
02:48:19,200 --> 02:48:25,540
Everybody's safe. I think has the trebum continued their voyage to the desert

702
02:48:26,340 --> 02:48:28,739
They felt a strange sense of being observed

703
02:48:29,920 --> 02:48:33,520
But this was not the cruel gaze of the cylinder and its servants

704
02:48:34,750 --> 02:48:35,709
No

705
02:48:35,709 --> 02:48:42,059
It was almost as if someone was trying to help them laying out a path for them to find

706
02:48:42,799 --> 02:48:46,159
The voice and their memories encouraged them to go forward

707
02:48:51,040 --> 02:48:53,040
All right. There's a couple points of interest here

708
02:48:53,649 --> 02:48:59,649
Which we will very much investigate when I go get another tea go pee and come back. I'll be right back

709
02:48:59,889 --> 02:55:04,620
See you in a minute those of you that are wondering I uh, I did see the emu

710
02:55:08,670 --> 02:55:16,159
Pretty cool. I know that people in the discord were very very adamant that I see this is bird

711
02:55:18,610 --> 02:55:20,610
What do you mean? What? Okay, so

712
02:55:20,770 --> 02:55:28,540
Let me explain for those of you that don't have any idea you just oh, yeah

713
02:55:28,540 --> 02:55:32,239
I saw the emu like what is he all right?

714
02:55:32,559 --> 02:55:38,209
I don't know if somebody in the discord uploaded a picture of like an emu in my room

715
02:55:38,290 --> 02:55:40,530
I'm saying get an emu pet instead of the beetles

716
02:55:43,809 --> 02:55:47,680
I was like, all right. It's like we need him to see this. Okay, I saw it

717
02:55:53,280 --> 02:55:57,280
Got a lemon ginger tea this time. I'm getting a little wacky

718
02:56:00,459 --> 02:56:01,659
Yeah, I'm

719
02:56:01,659 --> 02:56:04,829
Lemon ginger. Whoo. Slow down

720
02:56:12,940 --> 02:56:15,739
No, this is cool. Okay. I gotta let it sit for a minute though

721
02:56:16,059 --> 02:56:23,860
the problem I have with tea hot tea in particular is I will brew it and

722
02:56:24,579 --> 02:56:28,930
Let it just sit on a counter or something and the bags just stay in there for 10 minutes

723
02:56:29,010 --> 02:56:36,030
And it just ruins everything because then you get that weird that's that bad taste. It's got a certain name

724
02:56:36,030 --> 02:56:49,219
What's it called? This actually like it's a bad thing, right something leeches into the tea. What's it called tannins?

725
02:56:49,219 --> 02:56:59,440
Yep. Yeah tannins leech in there and it's just yeah, it's not good tannins aren't bad, but they're bitter

726
02:56:59,520 --> 02:57:02,959
Yeah, well not necessarily bad but bad in the sense of you don't want to taste it

727
02:57:03,280 --> 02:57:11,889
All right, I'll give it hey, please remind me because I will forget

728
02:57:13,059 --> 02:57:22,590
In two minutes take the tea bags out of the drink. I know I can rely on you guys. I know I can let's go

729
02:57:22,909 --> 02:57:34,959
Still got everybody. I was just laughing about this though. I was making the tea that I think this game

730
02:57:35,040 --> 02:57:38,000
You're supposed to lose creatures and get new ones

731
02:57:38,319 --> 02:57:42,579
But I just keep safe scumming with the same ones that we have because I don't want to lose anybody

732
02:57:45,059 --> 02:57:48,819
Every time we've come across a new couple of creatures in a new zone like this

733
02:57:49,709 --> 02:57:53,389
I think it's designed for it to be oh you lost one back there. Don't worry

734
02:57:53,389 --> 02:58:00,340
There's another one here, but we just keep passing everybody by we have I feel so bad

735
02:58:00,500 --> 02:58:14,610
We have our team and I I don't want to lose anybody. Well, we're going in here a lot of crunchies

736
02:58:22,030 --> 02:58:31,389
Uh jumping legs for this for sure who could use it and a cube. I have a cube don't I yes

737
02:58:31,549 --> 02:58:49,139
I do have a cube what I do. I don't know but get out of the water. What did that do?

738
02:58:52,049 --> 02:58:55,860
Oh, it turns this on. This is an egg right there as well. I'll come back down and get it

739
02:58:55,940 --> 02:58:57,940
I just want to get out of the oh shit. Cool

740
02:58:58,180 --> 02:59:26,989
You do this you take it because that's the way to get out. Oh my fucking god. They're gonna die

741
02:59:28,510 --> 02:59:52,690
Come on, man. I can't eat it from the menu. Why not? Thank god. I had that

742
03:00:01,100 --> 03:00:02,059
Jesus

743
03:00:02,059 --> 03:00:08,190
Okay, that was almost a disaster. I there's a lot down. I wish I could just leave people up here

744
03:00:09,790 --> 03:00:20,850
Tannins the tannins the tannins. Okay, I got it. Thank you. It's really been two minutes time flies

745
03:00:21,090 --> 03:00:33,069
Okay, I gotta do the dunk pole dunk pole dunk pole dunk pole because I don't I don't feel like stirring it. Okay

746
03:00:33,850 --> 03:00:46,290
Transferring transfer success. No mess. All right, let's go. There's a bunch of shit down here

747
03:00:46,370 --> 03:00:59,409
I'm getting it all gotta go quick crystals

748
03:00:59,969 --> 03:01:27,680
Yep. Hey, come on. Come on. Come on the egg. I hate jumping on the rocks in this game. Hurry up. Hurry up

749
03:01:31,739 --> 03:01:44,079
Guelphal. All right guelphal. Let's go. We gotta get up now. I can't get all this shit. Ah

750
03:01:44,639 --> 03:01:48,239
Greedy greedy greedy greedy bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad

751
03:02:01,090 --> 03:02:14,100
Everybody's alive. Just barely I need health so bad. It's so dangerous down there

752
03:02:15,139 --> 03:02:19,219
Every single one of them just follows you in and they just die in the water

753
03:02:19,459 --> 03:02:38,530
Okay, everyone just regen out of combat. Pretty good. I don't even get to see the new guy. Where's the new guy?

754
03:02:38,690 --> 03:03:03,649
Is this is you watch out? All right, anything else I can do here. I did the hole there is this

755
03:03:03,649 --> 03:03:09,899
Let's go do this. I think this is probably a yeah, let's do that

756
03:03:10,139 --> 03:03:27,440
How many crystals do I have because I can get another party member. I can do it. I need six mushrooms

757
03:03:27,680 --> 03:03:44,079
Oh, I have six mushrooms. I don't think I hold on. I don't have six mushrooms. Guto. All right

758
03:03:44,079 --> 03:04:15,120
I need six mushrooms keep an eye out. Oh, wait, there's an upload tank over here. Come on mushrooms fire upload tank

759
03:04:15,440 --> 03:04:39,940
I could pull somebody out who's in here. Rutemu and Wugwul are in here. I could also revive

760
03:04:41,100 --> 03:05:26,819
Gowu, I do have room for one more. Rutemu, Wugwul. I mean, this is free. I think we're at our capacity

761
03:05:27,969 --> 03:05:38,610
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Can we get can we have nine? What about Gowu?

762
03:05:38,930 --> 03:05:51,569
Gowu is still there in spirit. Oh, here we go. I need one more mushroom

763
03:05:51,809 --> 03:06:01,629
The one you get don't nobody eat one. I need one more mushroom and I can go get the other. There we go

764
03:06:01,790 --> 03:06:24,129
Okay, rescue. Let's go. Is it eight or nine if it's eight? I'll just put somebody back

765
03:06:24,370 --> 03:06:38,290
Okay, so it is. Which one of you is the least interesting? Fire stomp eyes

766
03:06:39,319 --> 03:06:47,250
regeneration horn cube jump sticky feet fuzzy airhead

767
03:06:49,969 --> 03:06:52,340
uh webbed feet and

768
03:06:53,819 --> 03:07:08,659
Anti-poison. What's your deal? What's your deal? You got nothing. I like the way you look though. That's the new guy

769
03:07:10,379 --> 03:07:19,739
Yeah, should we should we get Guto? Yeah, I want Guto. All right, I'm gonna put Wugwul back

770
03:07:19,979 --> 03:07:32,850
Get rid of the crest 3d white one

771
03:07:37,010 --> 03:07:43,409
Uh, you were you were really close. That was really funny, but you meant to say

772
03:07:44,030 --> 03:07:45,940
aqua fresh

773
03:07:45,940 --> 03:07:53,010
Shower clean. That's what it is. It's not crest. It's aqua fresh. The joke was there

774
03:07:53,250 --> 03:08:07,139
A ruin some part of an old temple. No, not quite. Wait, what happened to the wait a minute? What's going on?

775
03:08:27,459 --> 03:08:40,340
Oh, well, this is the group we have had the trebum walked into a trap was their journey

776
03:08:40,819 --> 03:08:45,780
over

777
03:08:45,780 --> 03:08:51,329
crystals though the scorn like

778
03:08:51,889 --> 03:09:03,680
This actually is a scorn like I agree. I I see it. I understand that what was this place?

779
03:09:05,069 --> 03:09:07,379
Were the trebum dead?

780
03:09:07,379 --> 03:09:10,020
If so, this was a very odd after life

781
03:09:14,030 --> 03:09:16,030
Evie the elder

782
03:09:16,030 --> 03:09:23,569
What is going on?

783
03:09:23,569 --> 03:09:33,540
Uh, I perhaps this strange elder could tell them what was going on

784
03:09:34,020 --> 03:09:36,659
But before they could ask the elder spoke

785
03:09:37,540 --> 03:09:40,659
The celestial trephala have seen your journey

786
03:09:41,459 --> 03:09:47,540
And I have been told of your deeds. Why was it? Why are they trying to kill us between our people?

787
03:09:48,159 --> 03:09:50,159
trebum and trephala

788
03:09:50,659 --> 03:09:55,700
We once lived in harmony, but the invasion of our world has split us apart

789
03:09:56,739 --> 03:09:58,739
If you do not know their song

790
03:09:59,219 --> 03:10:03,940
The trephala will not recognize you as a friend. So I am here to help you

791
03:10:04,819 --> 03:10:06,819
As much as I can

792
03:10:07,579 --> 03:10:11,420
The floating palaces you seek lie ahead as you were told

793
03:10:12,219 --> 03:10:16,780
But they will be of no use to you unless you reclaim all the powers

794
03:10:17,340 --> 03:10:20,719
Of our people which the cylinder has stolen

795
03:10:22,030 --> 03:10:24,030
There is only one way to do so

796
03:10:24,670 --> 03:10:30,350
By entering the portal that links our world to the dreams of the eternal cylinder

797
03:10:31,700 --> 03:10:36,819
The greatest of the cylinder's servants the mathematician is the gatekeeper

798
03:10:37,620 --> 03:10:44,979
He absorbs that which is of value to the cylinder and his master has become intrigued by the crystals

799
03:10:45,379 --> 03:10:47,379
That the trephala wear as crowns

800
03:10:48,340 --> 03:10:50,340
Find these crystals

801
03:10:50,340 --> 03:10:54,420
And acquire the mutation which will allow you to appear as one of them

802
03:10:55,299 --> 03:10:59,139
Thus you will trick the mathematician into granting you passage

803
03:11:00,000 --> 03:11:02,639
And now I must return you to the land

804
03:11:03,200 --> 03:11:04,799
There is little time

805
03:11:04,799 --> 03:11:08,559
The trephala are being hunted and only few are left

806
03:11:09,280 --> 03:11:11,440
May you succeed in your quest?

807
03:11:12,079 --> 03:11:14,079
for all our sakes

808
03:11:25,680 --> 03:11:37,790
Hold on

809
03:11:37,790 --> 03:11:39,870
So, okay

810
03:11:39,870 --> 03:11:45,870
We need to get the crystal we're beginning to understand that there was more to this journey than mere survival

811
03:11:47,489 --> 03:11:49,889
So far they had acted only for themselves

812
03:11:51,010 --> 03:11:55,889
But now they had been entrusted with a task that would affect many others

813
03:11:56,610 --> 03:11:59,229
And although that was frightening

814
03:11:59,629 --> 03:12:02,350
The knowledge that they were acting for the greater good

815
03:12:03,069 --> 03:12:04,750
Gave them strength

816
03:12:04,750 --> 03:12:10,479
So we're going to look like a crystal that's on top of one of those

817
03:12:11,840 --> 03:12:13,200
serpent heads

818
03:12:13,200 --> 03:12:15,709
I wonder how we do that

819
03:12:15,709 --> 03:12:18,079
It will unfold

820
03:12:18,079 --> 03:12:21,360
In front of us. I imagine the next several hours

821
03:12:23,280 --> 03:12:25,280
All right, let's go store one of these

822
03:12:28,559 --> 03:12:42,049
Well, that was a cool scene. I mean

823
03:12:42,940 --> 03:12:45,340
Wugwul you just got maybe it shouldn't be wugwul

824
03:12:46,780 --> 03:12:51,219
swimming

825
03:12:51,219 --> 03:13:01,549
Hmm. I'm wearing ice world. I don't think we need wugwul. Sorry. Well, you got a little bit of exercise

826
03:13:01,870 --> 03:13:12,770
You're gonna go back in. Okay. Now let's go get a new character

827
03:13:25,790 --> 03:13:29,659
Send his ass back to hell. That's not he's in the cloud

828
03:13:33,069 --> 03:13:35,149
Who's this?

829
03:13:35,149 --> 03:13:45,340
Vivino this person's this is different, but we know is kind of way cooler

830
03:13:47,170 --> 03:13:53,680
This is not guto, but look at but look at villino

831
03:14:00,110 --> 03:14:12,770
Okay. All right. Well, I have the mushroom so i'm doing it. Just gotta remember where that was

832
03:14:14,860 --> 03:14:16,860
Over here, isn't it? Oops. Sorry

833
03:14:19,219 --> 03:14:26,270
Where is it?

834
03:14:26,270 --> 03:14:27,950
Yeah, where's guto?

835
03:14:27,950 --> 03:14:37,760
Where is that?

836
03:14:37,760 --> 03:14:40,350
You got replaced

837
03:14:40,350 --> 03:14:44,450
Oh fuck

838
03:14:44,450 --> 03:14:49,260
You come near me. I'm gonna blow you to hell. I'm just saying i'm just saying i'm just saying

839
03:14:57,920 --> 03:15:02,190
Did he get replaced? I think he got replaced

840
03:15:03,600 --> 03:15:17,600
Yeah, I think he's replaced shit, um the cutscene replaced him, but that's annoying

841
03:15:22,049 --> 03:15:24,479
You go get that ice monster

842
03:15:24,479 --> 03:15:42,700
I want to upgrade before I do that. There are I did get some crystals

843
03:15:43,180 --> 03:16:13,059
Uh-huh. There's gonna be a shitload of crystals probably in here. I'd eat three of these

844
03:16:16,399 --> 03:16:24,750
Make sure I do not get rid of three of these mushrooms are fine because we're not uh guto's not available anymore

845
03:16:25,069 --> 03:16:34,909
So that's all good five

846
03:16:35,069 --> 03:16:38,579
Uh-huh. Ooh

847
03:16:38,579 --> 03:17:14,059
It's a big one. Very nice. Yep. Can these be broken? Well, I currently have a full party

848
03:17:14,139 --> 03:17:34,180
So i'm not too concerned about it. Okay. Let me get these to the

849
03:17:38,750 --> 03:18:13,889
Processor throw the tea that tea's fine. Nice and hot. Yeah, I took the tea bags out

850
03:18:13,969 --> 03:18:17,739
You guys are like 40 minutes late. I already did it

851
03:18:22,219 --> 03:18:26,139
All right. I need whatever that is like some kind of like a tongue or something. What is that?

852
03:18:37,520 --> 03:18:51,840
Derma the tannins derma the tannins. Oh shit the tannins you're right. It's ruined. What do I do?

853
03:18:53,059 --> 03:19:10,209
Stamina wheel I have 12. I don't think you can go wrong with the stamina wheel for health. Here we go

854
03:19:10,450 --> 03:19:18,620
I wonder if i'll have enough to do health in the meantime

855
03:19:18,860 --> 03:19:36,850
The projection shared a recipe with the treba one which could protect them from the light of the cylinder's servants permanent inflatable body

856
03:19:41,139 --> 03:19:52,690
Uh, I gotta start paying attention to this six mushrooms and three

857
03:19:53,680 --> 03:19:58,500
luffies

858
03:19:58,500 --> 03:20:01,059
two fish two crystals

859
03:20:04,209 --> 03:20:08,639
Okay

860
03:20:08,639 --> 03:20:14,750
All right. All right. I don't think I can do that for a while. So let's track a different one

861
03:20:16,020 --> 03:20:18,020
How about inflatable?

862
03:20:20,260 --> 03:20:22,450
Probably this one

863
03:20:22,450 --> 03:20:24,379
Yeah

864
03:20:24,379 --> 03:20:31,409
Yeah, uh, yep. This was made by the rock of ages dev also xeno clash

865
03:20:32,049 --> 03:20:45,229
How much crystals do I have two three?

866
03:20:46,620 --> 03:21:13,059
All right. I got more stamina. I'm happy with it. Gunu is still alive. Yeah, wait, let me get some water. Okay

867
03:21:13,700 --> 03:21:27,149
I think i'm good to go. I've got the crystals. I need water. Cool. Let's get out of here

868
03:21:32,750 --> 03:21:37,170
You should name one of the beetles Gunu. That might be cute

869
03:21:40,100 --> 03:21:54,239
You're dead the hell was that I need these I need three of these right? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

870
03:21:54,239 --> 03:21:57,760
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

871
03:21:58,719 --> 03:22:20,540
Somebody else pick it up. Please you it's three fluffies the suck sound off

872
03:22:21,020 --> 03:22:40,049
No, I can't hear the sucking. I need six mushrooms and I can do this one

873
03:22:40,290 --> 03:22:52,700
I don't think I want to fuck around with that. I'm probably gonna need that material to

874
03:22:53,420 --> 03:22:57,760
Have a permanent upgrade. It's terrifying to me and I don't really want to fight it

875
03:22:59,389 --> 03:23:50,290
Did I didn't even care who's got the horn who has the horn who's got the horn I need to use it right now

876
03:23:50,290 --> 03:24:24,020
Nobody has the horn Gunu has the horn. He just doesn't even care. Why am I hurt getting hurt? Don't you get idiot?

877
03:24:24,420 --> 03:25:10,690
It's actually really annoying to pick people with the controller not who I wanted. Oh shit. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out dangerous

878
03:25:10,770 --> 03:25:16,579
It's dangerous over here. It's dangerous. Nice. All right, pick it up. Let's get the fuck out of here

879
03:25:17,059 --> 03:25:25,299
All right, somebody needs to be just the person that holds everything

880
03:25:28,110 --> 03:25:41,790
I think it's gonna have to be we won't just don't eat that I need health. I could have gone worse

881
03:25:42,030 --> 03:26:26,620
See any mushrooms yell fucking ice monster died from poop rocks. It works. It works use the eye

882
03:26:27,809 --> 03:26:37,920
Ah now you're thinking

883
03:26:40,420 --> 03:26:45,280
Yes, eat one

884
03:26:47,309 --> 03:27:03,870
Six, right? I'm going to trip the wall. So where am I going from here? I actually don't know

885
03:27:07,139 --> 03:27:09,440
um

886
03:27:09,440 --> 03:27:11,620
Is the wall right here?

887
03:27:39,979 --> 03:27:46,159
Aha, yes, okay. Let's do it. Okay. So this is

888
03:27:47,340 --> 03:28:03,760
Uh the bird skin permanent mutation are these permanent because that's a pretty big deal if it's permanent

889
03:28:03,920 --> 03:28:16,340
What else can I do? This one's third eye? This is probably the closest one

890
03:28:16,340 --> 03:28:26,190
I have I wonder if I can look it up with the third eye. Maybe these organs anywhere. I'll keep it on

891
03:28:26,430 --> 03:28:32,879
All right. Well, that's good. Now. They just automatically enable it when they need it. It's a big deal. Okay, so

892
03:28:35,299 --> 03:28:45,899
We are good to continue moving. I'm going to select somebody else. You got like a missile. Okay, you got bombs

893
03:28:46,219 --> 03:29:08,129
Did you activate it? Um, I don't think I could there's one last thing over here

894
03:29:08,690 --> 03:29:17,739
Actually, I probably should stay with um, we bomb just in case one of these things pop up

895
03:29:17,899 --> 03:29:22,579
Why why are we getting hurt? I'm hurt. I shouldn't be hurt

896
03:29:36,739 --> 03:29:42,510
Everybody hurts

897
03:29:42,510 --> 03:29:49,920
Okay. Yeah, I get some more of those. I feel like I might need wait these counters minerals

898
03:29:52,159 --> 03:30:05,700
No, all right. We got am I pulling somebody out of here? I gotta go get yeah, we need eight. Let's close it up

899
03:30:19,010 --> 03:30:20,510
Get the new guy

900
03:30:20,510 --> 03:30:26,190
Unfortunately, the new guy was randomly rolled to a different new guy and I don't have the materials

901
03:30:28,100 --> 03:30:37,680
All right, we got a whole crew now and that one can swim get the big power from the river

902
03:30:38,420 --> 03:30:57,940
Somebody should be big. That's true

903
03:30:57,940 --> 03:31:02,850
Oh, fuck. Yeah, I get all these crystals

904
03:31:10,299 --> 03:31:34,030
Crystals need food. Oh, you got all those steaks eat them. You're just supposed to be crystal person. I need to knock

905
03:31:34,670 --> 03:32:15,549
Nobody else touch these please who can jump somebody is you have jumping come here

906
03:32:15,790 --> 03:32:29,600
I don't think I can get the ones up there, but that's fine

907
03:32:30,159 --> 03:32:38,899
It's funny

908
03:32:38,979 --> 03:32:40,180
What is that?

909
03:32:40,180 --> 03:32:47,020
This is like a pumpkin

910
03:32:47,020 --> 03:32:52,299
Shit, who's gonna eat the pumpkin? Wait new guy this is for you

911
03:32:54,620 --> 03:33:00,110
Oh, you're not even the new guy. Where's the new guy? Oh, you're over there. Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm losing track

912
03:33:00,750 --> 03:33:19,420
Here you take this

913
03:33:19,420 --> 03:33:26,159
Long-distance water squirting. Oh my goodness. That's far

914
03:33:26,719 --> 03:33:35,549
I mean, that's not I mean, that's kind of I guess it's kind of cool

915
03:33:38,340 --> 03:33:40,700
I guess

916
03:33:40,700 --> 03:33:42,700
Well, it was definitely wait. It might be an egg

917
03:33:47,180 --> 03:33:50,319
What is all this stuff?

918
03:33:50,879 --> 03:33:52,879
I feel like I need to I should probably save some of these

919
03:33:54,510 --> 03:33:58,110
Okay, just save the rest of these because this looks like an interesting flower

920
03:34:18,270 --> 03:34:35,620
Interesting. Oh wait. I need this to to get uh, whatever their name was now. We got a full squad

921
03:34:38,219 --> 03:34:46,510
We got a full squad. It's probably randomized again. We got a full squad. We got eight. Look at it. It's a full squad

922
03:34:50,350 --> 03:34:59,760
Best way to go. Actually, I don't know. It's kind of far. Let me get a better view

923
03:35:00,000 --> 03:35:06,940
We don't even need to be running around with a full squad either

924
03:35:07,100 --> 03:35:08,750
It's just I don't know

925
03:35:08,750 --> 03:35:14,879
I feel like they have they're friends and I wouldn't want two or three of them to be alone. Not cool

926
03:35:15,120 --> 03:35:58,340
I want to get these stakes. All right, got plenty of stakes. So the best way to go is

927
03:35:59,709 --> 03:36:06,639
Okay, straight here bang a left outside of the force field. Yeah, that's the right way to go. Let's move

928
03:36:17,469 --> 03:36:29,170
Are they fighting? All right. So then from here not go this way. It's wait, there might be something there

929
03:36:31,780 --> 03:36:33,700
What a cave?

930
03:36:33,700 --> 03:36:38,370
So many things to look at. I don't know if I go in there. I'm gonna all right. We're just gonna go

931
03:36:39,440 --> 03:36:42,049
Eat some food

932
03:36:42,049 --> 03:36:43,950
full water

933
03:36:43,950 --> 03:36:49,229
Nope, it's crystals down there and shit. Sorry. They're

934
03:36:49,850 --> 03:36:54,739
Completionist Andy. I know

935
03:36:54,739 --> 03:37:01,219
Is anybody else snug as a bug right now?

936
03:37:06,780 --> 03:37:08,780
It's it's okay. I got I got time

937
03:37:12,770 --> 03:37:32,799
snug as a bug

938
03:37:32,879 --> 03:37:45,569
Made it that way. I have to make my way to one of those serpents, right?

939
03:37:49,340 --> 03:38:13,100
Temple right here should touch the cylinder. I don't do that. It might kill me. I want

940
03:38:13,819 --> 03:38:23,920
Come here

941
03:38:23,920 --> 03:39:10,340
Get the fuck away from me touch it. No, what if it hurts if it hurts? That's bad. You won't know unless you try crystals

942
03:39:13,299 --> 03:39:20,120
Wait glow in the dark. Oh, that's right. You were glow in the dark. You are multi-talented

943
03:39:21,250 --> 03:39:30,209
Cool, all right. Uh, we're gonna use the piss man. Where's piss man? There you are

944
03:39:30,290 --> 03:39:43,120
This man's gonna knock down all these stones. Is this even piss man? No, this is piss man

945
03:39:43,200 --> 03:40:22,389
Everybody get out of the way got it carbonate mutation incoming. I need more distance. Here we go. This should do it really

946
03:40:22,790 --> 03:40:49,829
Are you serious dude? How bad do you piss on the toilet seat?

947
03:40:56,340 --> 03:41:01,700
Um one time recently I was so tired. I don't know what happened

948
03:41:02,659 --> 03:41:05,620
But i'm usually pretty good about that. I'm usually very good about that

949
03:41:07,030 --> 03:41:10,069
But I was I must have been really tired like just out of a dead sleep

950
03:41:10,870 --> 03:41:14,069
And I think dude, I just pissed I think all over this toilet

951
03:41:17,170 --> 03:41:20,520
Because holly said she went into the room into the bathroom

952
03:41:21,399 --> 03:41:23,719
And walked out. She was like nope

953
03:41:28,930 --> 03:41:32,370
I definitely just pissed all over it too. It was so bad

954
03:41:35,520 --> 03:41:39,940
What that was the raid? Hey, hey

955
03:41:41,379 --> 03:41:43,379
What's going on? Welcome

956
03:41:43,540 --> 03:41:47,059
Thanks for the uh, thanks for the raid. It was honey goblin

957
03:41:48,309 --> 03:41:51,520
Thanks honey goblin welcome everybody. Hope you had a good stream

958
03:41:52,680 --> 03:41:55,559
Pretty cool. We were talking about something very very normal

959
03:41:56,610 --> 03:41:58,610
Not anything strange promise

960
03:42:01,299 --> 03:42:06,340
Yeah, we don't even need to honestly we don't even need to repeat what we were just talking about. This is unnecessary

961
03:42:10,930 --> 03:42:13,409
Right. There's no reason to even bring it up ever again

962
03:42:14,290 --> 03:42:16,049
For any certain thing

963
03:42:16,049 --> 03:42:25,649
How come this doesn't work? It needs to be like a concentrated pee stream

964
03:42:27,329 --> 03:42:36,549
Everybody do it

965
03:42:36,790 --> 03:42:38,149
Oh, no, no

966
03:42:38,149 --> 03:42:48,020
Whoops, it's all right. Who cares? Yeah. Thanks for the raid. Welcome. This is the eternal cylinder

967
03:42:48,340 --> 03:42:50,340
Give you a quick recap of what's going on

968
03:42:52,629 --> 03:42:53,510
the

969
03:42:53,510 --> 03:42:57,190
Point of the game is these little creatures they have different mutations you can do

970
03:42:57,829 --> 03:43:03,719
And there's a gigantic rolling pin. That's uh crushing earth imagining. We're on some kind of earth

971
03:43:04,440 --> 03:43:21,090
Let me do this permanent mutation real quick. Where is it? This one? Okay, so this is I can make a

972
03:43:21,809 --> 03:43:28,239
mixer body

973
03:43:28,239 --> 03:43:30,479
All right, so I can turn it on

974
03:43:33,540 --> 03:43:50,360
Cool. I well this I don't want to turn it on to everybody though. Stop bumping into each other

975
03:43:53,459 --> 03:43:54,100
All right

976
03:43:54,100 --> 03:43:55,299
What do you got for us?

977
03:43:55,299 --> 03:44:03,170
The projection from wherever you're controlling shared its wisdom with the trebum

978
03:44:03,729 --> 03:44:07,969
And showed them how to protect it from the evil light of their enemies

979
03:44:08,450 --> 03:44:17,479
Good thing I held on to that because this is greatly improves trebum regenerative capabilities

980
03:44:18,850 --> 03:44:23,520
Missing one object some kind of brain. I think that's a brain

981
03:44:27,670 --> 03:44:29,190
I'll track it for now

982
03:44:29,190 --> 03:44:29,989
All right

983
03:44:29,989 --> 03:44:33,479
Decision time

984
03:44:33,479 --> 03:44:56,879
Where's the jumper? I'm just getting these for the uh for the material collector

985
03:44:57,280 --> 03:45:01,409
That's a lot. I know i'm gonna spend like a half an hour doing this. It's all right

986
03:45:01,409 --> 03:45:04,450
Just like just like I don't know wash a few dishes or something

987
03:45:06,370 --> 03:45:12,049
You know that gross ass cup that's sitting on your fucking desk right now the disgusting one that you peer in

988
03:45:12,530 --> 03:45:18,049
And this it's just wow, that's fucking gross. Go just go right now while i'm doing this and just go clean that cup

989
03:45:19,780 --> 03:45:24,260
I know you all have one everybody has one everybody has one gross ass cup that's sitting there

990
03:45:24,420 --> 03:45:27,219
That's been there for probably a week and it's fucking filthy. Just do it now

991
03:45:28,479 --> 03:45:30,079
Do it now while you have a minute

992
03:45:30,079 --> 03:45:46,229
I don't use a cup

993
03:45:46,229 --> 03:45:49,670
You're drinking water with your hands you're drinking. What are you are you scooping it up?

994
03:45:51,059 --> 03:45:58,239
Out of a well with your hands. What are you talking about? All right, that's enough crystals

995
03:45:59,040 --> 03:46:01,600
No, it's not it's never enough crystals

996
03:46:02,239 --> 03:46:04,879
Are you serious?

997
03:46:04,879 --> 03:46:06,879
You don't think i'm gonna get all those up there?

998
03:46:07,860 --> 03:46:10,280
I have to

999
03:46:10,280 --> 03:46:28,870
If I don't get those crystals, I will disintegrate. I have to get them. Fuck you

1000
03:46:31,430 --> 03:46:55,350
Not you know, not you but in general. All right, that's good enough. That's good. That's good enough. That's good enough

1001
03:46:55,510 --> 03:47:23,299
That's good enough. All right, let's give them to the uh, crusher. It's almost full stacks of crystals health. Um

1002
03:47:26,340 --> 03:47:34,979
Yeah, stamina is fine

1003
03:47:40,340 --> 03:47:46,770
I need three didn't I already do that upgrade. Did I not do that upgrade? I thought I did it already

1004
03:47:47,010 --> 03:47:57,360
I got time. All right, uh maximum food. I'm gonna do this next in about 10 seconds

1005
03:47:57,680 --> 03:48:15,250
I washed a cup good do leadership. I did leadership twice already

1006
03:48:15,489 --> 03:48:25,590
I feel like it's gonna be way too expensive at this point 13. Yeah, no, we'll do that later. I got eight wait

1007
03:48:25,989 --> 03:48:39,190
Spray it wait. I need three you said there we go refill the water and let's get out of here

1008
03:48:39,270 --> 03:48:46,760
Hey, dude, can you please just say yippee? Yeah

1009
03:48:48,870 --> 03:49:06,450
Is that what you wanted? I am satisfied with this. I do want to eat. Let's give oh you oh, yeah

1010
03:49:06,450 --> 03:49:16,790
Yeah, yeah, Guelvo's got all the steaks Guelvo. Come here, please. I'm gonna cook us up

1011
03:49:16,790 --> 03:49:43,270
Why don't you fry us up some of those steaks new york city new york city

1012
03:49:51,809 --> 03:50:01,459
All right, there's a hole over there though. Let's go in the hole never mind go

1013
03:50:18,690 --> 03:50:36,549
Treasures lie in here for our treble and fret. Oh, okay worth it

1014
03:50:36,870 --> 03:50:44,319
And there's a shitload of crystals down here. You know what i'm doing down here. All right, who can somebody take this?

1015
03:50:44,639 --> 03:50:51,799
I can take a bowl full

1016
03:50:51,959 --> 03:50:55,399
Health, that's a big deal. All right. I need uh, where's my

1017
03:50:56,280 --> 03:51:08,629
Uh refinery I need you down here. They're trying to do it through the wall

1018
03:51:09,190 --> 03:51:27,440
They're trying they're helping. All right. You actually have to come down here though guys. Come on

1019
03:51:39,030 --> 03:51:52,000
Actually come down there's so many big thick crystals down here you where it you

1020
03:51:52,639 --> 03:52:09,590
Don't side eye me like that you get down here get over here get these

1021
03:52:10,309 --> 03:52:28,340
These things have a lot in them seven. There's like 15 down here

1022
03:52:28,979 --> 03:52:43,489
Maybe if you all got out of the way i'd be able to do this faster

1023
03:52:44,049 --> 03:53:01,010
Did I get them all camera? Are you not helping?

1024
03:53:12,690 --> 03:53:15,569
Okay

1025
03:53:15,569 --> 03:53:18,959
Cool. I'm rooting for the other team

1026
03:53:19,360 --> 03:53:24,399
You suck

1027
03:53:24,399 --> 03:53:26,770
Enjoy your ban

1028
03:53:27,170 --> 03:53:31,139
Enjoy your ban

1029
03:53:31,139 --> 03:53:37,360
and and

1030
03:53:37,360 --> 03:53:38,709
See you

1031
03:53:38,709 --> 03:53:41,239
Hey, see you later

1032
03:53:41,239 --> 03:53:43,239
Hey, huh? Enjoy the ban

1033
03:53:46,260 --> 03:53:54,360
Yeah. Hi. Hey, don't let the door hit you

1034
03:53:55,879 --> 03:53:56,920
and

1035
03:53:56,920 --> 03:54:04,629
See you

1036
03:54:04,629 --> 03:54:09,190
Uh everybody in everybody back in everybody get back in back in back in everybody back back in back in back in don't die, please

1037
03:54:12,950 --> 03:54:18,069
I just spent like 10 minutes mining this fucking goddamn hole if one of you gets sucked up by the alien thing

1038
03:54:18,069 --> 03:54:28,370
I'm gonna be so upset

1039
03:54:28,850 --> 03:54:30,530
Bye

1040
03:54:30,530 --> 03:54:42,049
Oh, you probably giggle when godzilla cry no way what?

1041
03:54:42,690 --> 03:54:54,079
If you had to pick one of these creatures to be which one would you be and why?

1042
03:54:56,280 --> 03:55:03,280
Uh, hmm, probably this one. I can just put rocks in my mouth and turn it into money in my bank account

1043
03:55:04,069 --> 03:55:05,510
that seems

1044
03:55:05,510 --> 03:55:21,729
Like a great thing to do

1045
03:55:21,729 --> 03:55:30,629
All right. I got that. We just gotta go this way now and yes over here. All right, let's move

1046
03:55:30,870 --> 03:55:42,850
I think we got everything we needed. Are we on food? I think we're fine. I just gotta let's get it in the right spot

1047
03:55:51,399 --> 03:56:01,110
Hey, look at that. Perfect. This is a straight shot here

1048
03:56:02,549 --> 03:56:03,670
and

1049
03:56:03,670 --> 03:56:49,090
Go take a break

1050
03:56:50,129 --> 03:56:55,540
That was pretty uneventful feel good about that

1051
03:57:06,020 --> 03:57:07,379
You actually made it

1052
03:57:07,379 --> 03:57:09,219
Good for you. Wow

1053
03:57:09,219 --> 03:57:10,979
Actually did it. Yes

1054
03:57:10,979 --> 03:57:14,500
These were the crystals that the trowala used as crowds

1055
03:57:15,879 --> 03:57:22,930
The trebum wondered what secret powers they hid really but there was little time to think about such things as soon

1056
03:57:23,409 --> 03:57:26,610
The mathematician would make his terrible entrance

1057
03:57:27,889 --> 03:57:34,319
Where drop it on you? I might reload the game would transform the skin into crystal. It had to be nearby

1058
03:57:34,879 --> 03:57:44,149
Let me just reset it

1059
03:57:44,149 --> 03:58:01,030
You like oreos? I do

1060
03:58:01,030 --> 03:58:12,360
What's your dream trebum blunt rotation? We already talked about this. You want me to do it fine this one

1061
03:58:13,079 --> 03:58:18,120
For sure. You're telling me you want to talk to some sick fucking fat rips this one could do

1062
03:58:20,290 --> 03:58:31,000
Okay, this one how many can be there four?

1063
03:58:32,360 --> 03:58:43,270
Including me this one like I think this is that's just cool

1064
03:58:45,510 --> 03:58:51,190
You bet your ass that he's gonna walk on the wall and just stick there and everyone's gonna go. Whoa. Yo, what the fuck?

1065
03:58:51,510 --> 03:59:06,120
I mean one of the cubes because I mean your your cube

1066
03:59:06,360 --> 03:59:11,649
That's just kind of don't you feel like this is a I feel like this would be like a great

1067
03:59:12,870 --> 03:59:17,030
I don't know like just sitting there on the couch like just fuzzy cube. You're like, oh, that's kind of cool

1068
03:59:17,110 --> 03:59:24,340
It's a huge shadow right now

1069
03:59:26,319 --> 03:59:30,040
That was so ominous what about me

1070
03:59:31,959 --> 03:59:33,239
I guess you could hit the blunt man

1071
03:59:33,239 --> 03:59:46,629
I don't know and the last one because I feel like play some pretty sick music when we all wanted it, right?

1072
03:59:46,870 --> 03:59:50,389
Everyone's sitting around rotation happens and then

1073
03:59:51,510 --> 04:00:07,280
Why is the audio still messed up? Okay, I need to get one of these crystals has to be we need to get this

1074
04:00:07,840 --> 04:00:22,870
Right skin. Okay one of these no, I think it is one of these

1075
04:00:23,190 --> 04:00:41,430
Do we need to break it or do something to it? Maybe I can process it. Maybe hold on

1076
04:00:41,590 --> 04:01:13,280
Can you do anything with that? I can't suck it in. Maybe I can burn it. It's on fire

1077
04:01:13,760 --> 04:01:27,569
No, it's not. I don't know. I actually might need to reset the whole game

1078
04:01:27,969 --> 04:01:32,879
The audio is still kind of messed up for me. Is that just a me problem?

1079
04:01:32,879 --> 04:01:40,500
Or are you can you like hear a lot of this stuff or is it half the audio gone? It's normal

1080
04:01:40,739 --> 04:01:52,280
Why does it sound so weird for me? I think I figured it out. Okay. Yeah, i'm good. Um

1081
04:01:52,840 --> 04:01:56,549
Well, I have to process the crystal somehow

1082
04:02:04,790 --> 04:02:07,059
There it was

1083
04:02:07,139 --> 04:02:11,620
The unifier ow now the trebum would have to be brave and clever

1084
04:02:11,860 --> 04:02:19,139
What find a way of defeating this dreadful creature? Okay, so they could claim the ingredient they needed to transform

1085
04:02:19,299 --> 04:02:36,260
Okay, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Um, what what do I do? Oh that would have been sick

1086
04:02:36,500 --> 04:02:38,500
Was a terrible enemy

1087
04:02:38,899 --> 04:02:42,899
But in its rage it had revealed its weakness. I need to eat

1088
04:02:43,620 --> 04:02:47,219
The crystal fragments it was igniting against it

1089
04:02:47,540 --> 04:02:52,100
Who's got the health the trebum would have to be nimble and make good use of their trunks

1090
04:02:52,979 --> 04:02:55,940
But this was a challenge they were fit for

1091
04:03:03,510 --> 04:03:08,069
Thank god. Okay, everyone move move move out move out move out vote far away far away

1092
04:03:08,870 --> 04:03:17,719
far away

1093
04:03:17,719 --> 04:03:19,000
Shoot it

1094
04:03:19,000 --> 04:03:21,360
Shoot it shoot him

1095
04:03:21,680 --> 04:03:25,889
I I don't understand how to shoot him. I don't I don't get it

1096
04:03:26,530 --> 04:03:48,850
All right, there's no more crystals do they have to be glowing so to hurt or no

1097
04:03:51,809 --> 04:03:56,290
Yeah, I wish there was an aim so bad in this game like shoot it out. I can't I I cannot shoot this

1098
04:03:58,340 --> 04:04:00,340
I don't understand what's going on

1099
04:04:01,190 --> 04:04:03,280
um

1100
04:04:03,280 --> 04:04:04,239
Okay

1101
04:04:04,239 --> 04:04:10,690
And he's dead

1102
04:04:10,690 --> 04:04:15,409
Okay, that was I swear to god. That was the most awkward thing i've ever done in my whole life

1103
04:04:16,049 --> 04:04:32,200
It's very awkward

1104
04:05:04,129 --> 04:05:12,360
I see I can't like get close and it was the unifier. This is

1105
04:05:13,319 --> 04:05:19,000
Weird man, i'm saying clever and it's not a way of defeating this dreadful creature

1106
04:05:19,559 --> 04:05:23,959
So they could claim the ingredient they needed to transform. There's no aim

1107
04:05:24,520 --> 04:05:27,559
You just have to shoot it in a direction. Hope it doesn't hit the fucking ground

1108
04:05:41,350 --> 04:05:49,219
No, everybody run

1109
04:05:49,219 --> 04:06:02,309
Do it. Fuck you. Come on

1110
04:06:03,190 --> 04:06:19,760
Just don't be bad. I don't do the

1111
04:06:20,000 --> 04:06:21,200
the

1112
04:06:21,200 --> 04:06:28,739
You don't understand. It's weird. I have to get right in front of them. It slows the character down and then I have to like

1113
04:06:29,459 --> 04:06:33,270
I mean, it's very weird. It's very strange

1114
04:06:36,129 --> 04:06:48,819
Do you understand at the high ground? I might just shoot it over his head

1115
04:06:49,459 --> 04:06:59,590
I liked my I liked my way better

1116
04:07:00,229 --> 04:07:13,030
I need more crystals. He needs to break them

1117
04:07:29,440 --> 04:07:35,920
Crystals swish cheese objects that had fallen from the unifier's head must be the ingredients the tribum needed for the

1118
04:07:36,200 --> 04:08:04,420
Vegetation who wants to eat the weird cheese who wants it you nice blue cheese. It's kind of shiny. All right

1119
04:08:05,700 --> 04:08:12,479
Who else are you?

1120
04:08:12,479 --> 04:08:14,290
Oh

1121
04:08:14,290 --> 04:08:21,750
Right now that the tribum had transformed themselves. They would need to find the largest crystal formation in the area

1122
04:08:22,719 --> 04:08:30,229
That would be their best chance at tricking the mathematician into absorbing them. I mean, it's that right there

1123
04:08:37,059 --> 04:08:38,340
Did it work?

1124
04:08:38,340 --> 04:08:42,319
Oh, no

1125
04:08:42,319 --> 04:08:43,760
It's just you

1126
04:08:43,760 --> 04:09:04,309
I hope you're gonna be all right. Oh god. I actually puke warning everyone needs to be aware of this

1127
04:09:04,870 --> 04:09:08,870
This world gets a little weird in mirrors. It actually is kind of you can do something to see where

1128
04:09:09,510 --> 04:09:13,670
The tribum had returned to the strange place in the giant's dreams

1129
04:09:15,040 --> 04:09:22,739
There were more mysteries to uncover more memories to take back. The voice seemed even stronger now. Yes

1130
04:09:23,299 --> 04:09:25,299
Yes, I can almost

1131
04:09:25,700 --> 04:09:27,479
speak

1132
04:09:27,719 --> 04:09:29,799
Let me tell you your story

1133
04:09:30,520 --> 04:09:36,280
Okay, the song of your people is rich and beautiful

1134
04:09:40,100 --> 04:09:46,739
What did I just do what did I just do and so you learn to avoid repeating your mistakes

1135
04:09:47,680 --> 04:09:51,200
Slowly you discovered the secrets of your world remains alive

1136
04:09:51,600 --> 04:09:58,930
You built great cities full of wonders and then you sang to the stars to find others like you

1137
04:09:59,329 --> 04:10:10,600
To share in the joys of existence when you sang to the stars

1138
04:10:11,159 --> 04:10:13,159
There were many who heard you

1139
04:10:13,559 --> 04:10:15,799
And raised their voices in song

1140
04:10:17,479 --> 04:10:21,879
Most are gone now save for the trawana your oldest friends

1141
04:10:23,680 --> 04:10:25,680
When we heard your song

1142
04:10:26,159 --> 04:10:28,239
It was already too late for us

1143
04:10:29,280 --> 04:10:33,409
The cylinder was upon us and there was nothing we could do

1144
04:10:33,969 --> 04:10:35,010
Well

1145
04:10:35,010 --> 04:10:37,649
But we are not that different from you

1146
04:10:38,760 --> 04:10:40,760
We are also not strong

1147
04:10:41,079 --> 04:10:46,319
Or fast and we don't have sharp teeth. We are stubborn

1148
04:10:48,579 --> 04:10:52,819
The cylinder creates its minions from pieces of what it absorbs

1149
04:10:53,700 --> 04:10:55,780
So we found a way to help you

1150
04:10:57,540 --> 04:10:59,540
All of us together

1151
04:10:59,540 --> 04:11:03,860
These fragments of my people the memories of your ancestors

1152
04:11:05,239 --> 04:11:08,840
And what's left of all those others who shared our fate

1153
04:11:09,909 --> 04:11:16,069
A conspiracy of ghosts to sabotage the cylinder and give you a chance

1154
04:11:18,159 --> 04:11:20,159
There is more to be found

1155
04:11:20,559 --> 04:11:24,399
Memories to be reclaimed and what you need in order to

1156
04:11:25,280 --> 04:11:29,829
to a fading

1157
04:11:31,590 --> 04:11:33,760
Being absorbed

1158
04:11:33,840 --> 04:11:35,840
These moments of strength are rare

1159
04:11:36,319 --> 04:11:44,959
The voice could not continue

1160
04:11:45,459 --> 04:11:48,500
Once more it was only a memory

1161
04:12:12,239 --> 04:12:14,239
Group piss break

1162
04:12:20,579 --> 04:12:23,639
Okay

1163
04:12:23,639 --> 04:12:26,049
wacky

1164
04:12:26,049 --> 04:12:30,079
Interesting a little scary

1165
04:12:30,639 --> 04:12:54,790
Where we know that ocean we're at the end of the world

1166
04:13:07,190 --> 04:13:10,549
What was this artificial island on the horizon?

1167
04:13:11,350 --> 04:13:14,840
Could it be what the trebum had been told to search for?

1168
04:13:15,559 --> 04:13:20,260
Could their adventure be nearing an end? We're good on food knowledge. They had gained

1169
04:13:20,899 --> 04:13:25,139
All they now needed to do was to catch a specific kind of fish

1170
04:13:25,860 --> 04:13:32,420
Which would allow them to acquire the wonderful ability to swim without ever getting tired

1171
04:13:33,059 --> 04:13:34,659
Eat it

1172
04:13:34,659 --> 04:13:46,709
Water's cold

1173
04:13:46,709 --> 04:13:53,559
Hell, so what does what's the web feed for then?

1174
04:13:57,750 --> 04:13:59,750
Only one person has to have it. So let's go

1175
04:14:00,389 --> 04:14:05,329
Maybe the web maybe it stacks

1176
04:14:05,329 --> 04:14:07,200
Probably does stack

1177
04:14:07,200 --> 04:14:08,659
All right, let's go

1178
04:14:08,659 --> 04:14:10,659
Are they gonna get hurt from this? Whatever

1179
04:14:10,899 --> 04:14:19,520
The web heat makes you jump higher out of the water. This is really pretty

1180
04:14:20,159 --> 04:14:22,389
Looks really nice

1181
04:14:22,389 --> 04:14:27,829
They're all too cold

1182
04:14:27,829 --> 04:14:32,500
Um, i'm gonna save this

1183
04:14:32,500 --> 04:14:34,579
It's a little dinosaur. It does look like a little dinosaur

1184
04:14:53,250 --> 04:14:55,680
Cube's not looking great

1185
04:14:55,680 --> 04:14:57,680
Come on. Come on cube

1186
04:14:57,840 --> 04:15:00,899
All right, i'm gonna eat this

1187
04:15:00,899 --> 04:15:14,049
Please get out of the water. Please get out of the water

1188
04:15:19,989 --> 04:15:24,579
Uh cube ain't gonna make it the cube is dead officially as of right now

1189
04:15:29,809 --> 04:15:37,040
Yeah, we're gonna lose a couple people here

1190
04:15:37,040 --> 04:15:40,360
Eat another fish

1191
04:15:40,360 --> 04:15:43,299
Cube's dead

1192
04:15:48,049 --> 04:15:50,450
Oh just barely. All right, get out of here

1193
04:15:54,209 --> 04:15:56,850
Get up on the island. We're gonna eat we're gonna regen

1194
04:15:57,409 --> 04:15:59,010
Please tell me everyone's out

1195
04:15:59,010 --> 04:16:01,829
One two, three, four

1196
04:16:01,829 --> 04:16:03,829
Five six seven eight. Okay, we're good

1197
04:16:05,010 --> 04:16:06,610
All right, everybody relax

1198
04:16:06,610 --> 04:16:12,319
regen

1199
04:16:12,319 --> 04:16:14,159
I actually need some of these

1200
04:16:14,159 --> 04:16:21,079
For a um mutation get out of there

1201
04:16:30,950 --> 04:16:32,950
Okay, i'm gonna not do that shit

1202
04:16:36,500 --> 04:16:44,360
All right, so I need one inflatable body thing

1203
04:16:44,840 --> 04:16:46,840
I think somebody actually has one

1204
04:16:57,360 --> 04:16:58,950
You know what?

1205
04:16:58,950 --> 04:17:01,079
Eat the swim thing too

1206
04:17:01,079 --> 04:17:02,200
Eat the fish

1207
04:17:02,200 --> 04:17:10,069
You're going way too far away from me

1208
04:17:10,799 --> 04:17:13,360
Oh you piece of shit. It's okay. Everyone's still fine

1209
04:17:14,239 --> 04:18:04,520
Come on. We're good. Somebody else should take this but I don't know maybe not

1210
04:18:05,079 --> 04:18:06,719
I think we're fine

1211
04:18:06,719 --> 04:18:23,409
You idiot. I just want to heal

1212
04:18:34,290 --> 04:18:36,049
last bit here

1213
04:18:36,049 --> 04:18:52,799
What's that? Whatever. All right

1214
04:18:53,120 --> 04:18:56,639
tutmit the elder

1215
04:18:57,860 --> 04:19:05,280
Oh, this is alive

1216
04:19:05,280 --> 04:19:07,680
Is this its face or is this its back?

1217
04:19:30,520 --> 04:19:34,799
Oh, we're good

1218
04:19:34,799 --> 04:19:42,159
The tremor were happy to find a friend resting on the island. However, they quickly realized he was not well

1219
04:19:42,979 --> 04:19:44,979
The elder told him

1220
04:19:45,139 --> 04:19:50,200
What a pleasant surprise to find a group of such brave little adventurers

1221
04:19:51,219 --> 04:19:57,139
Oh, i'm glad to see your faces before my end. I don't know. I'm sorry to tell you

1222
04:19:57,780 --> 04:20:00,500
That this structure will not ascend on its own

1223
04:20:01,299 --> 04:20:06,500
I was hoping someone might bring the lenses that power this palace before the cylinder came

1224
04:20:07,059 --> 04:20:09,059
But as I can see

1225
04:20:09,139 --> 04:20:11,139
You do not know of what I speak

1226
04:20:12,020 --> 04:20:14,020
And this is simply not to be

1227
04:20:14,739 --> 04:20:16,340
But fear not

1228
04:20:16,340 --> 04:20:19,620
There are other palaces in the waters of this great desert

1229
04:20:20,340 --> 04:20:26,659
And resting in the golden dunes of these marvelous plains you will find the hidden treasures that can

1230
04:20:26,719 --> 04:20:34,579
Awaken and lift to their majestic heights the trebum palaces that were once the pride of our people

1231
04:20:35,459 --> 04:20:40,899
Swim over to the other side and seek the trawler that guards my brother's temple

1232
04:20:41,780 --> 04:20:45,250
He will explain what you must do. I wish you luck

1233
04:20:46,280 --> 04:20:50,600
Know that my spirit will dance and sing when you succeed

1234
04:20:51,159 --> 04:20:53,559
Where I have failed do we get that big?

1235
04:20:55,239 --> 04:20:57,239
It's kind of remarkable

1236
04:20:57,479 --> 04:21:00,520
We get to be that we get to be huge like this eventually

1237
04:21:01,319 --> 04:21:07,440
Well, don't worry

1238
04:21:07,440 --> 04:21:09,520
We'll do it. I'll make sure we we

1239
04:21:11,010 --> 04:21:14,850
I'm the leader. So i'll make sure that I tell all these other chumps what we need to do

1240
04:21:15,649 --> 04:21:19,780
Come on chumps

1241
04:21:19,780 --> 04:21:23,299
Follow me

1242
04:21:23,299 --> 04:21:32,520
Oh any three of them?

1243
04:21:40,840 --> 04:21:46,469
Wait, this is interesting stuff

1244
04:21:47,110 --> 04:21:50,129
But you still have the like the weird moon cheese

1245
04:21:59,620 --> 04:22:08,399
I thought that was water

1246
04:22:08,399 --> 04:22:10,399
Would you eat a cheese that looked like that? I don't think I would

1247
04:22:13,040 --> 04:22:16,579
Maybe I actually know maybe I would it's kind of good

1248
04:22:22,319 --> 04:22:29,030
Okay

1249
04:22:29,030 --> 04:22:32,959
Whoa, I guess we have to get on this

1250
04:22:33,840 --> 04:22:34,879
and

1251
04:22:34,879 --> 04:22:38,309
What's the plan here? We have to like blow it

1252
04:22:43,700 --> 04:22:49,829
Be careful

1253
04:22:49,829 --> 04:22:52,920
Well, whatever

1254
04:22:52,920 --> 04:23:03,540
uh

1255
04:23:03,540 --> 04:23:06,739
Just go just go just go just go just go just go just go

1256
04:23:13,860 --> 04:23:15,860
Wait, there's like a what is that?

1257
04:23:16,020 --> 04:23:46,229
I don't know. It's something weird. What is this thing? It's hot. We're kind of burning up here. It's gonna be kind of sad

1258
04:23:57,159 --> 04:23:59,000
you lucky

1259
04:23:59,000 --> 04:24:01,040
lucky bastard

1260
04:24:01,040 --> 04:24:01,920
Yeah

1261
04:24:01,920 --> 04:24:13,010
They drop something during the brightest hours of the day. The desert is too hot for trebum unless they stay in the shade or get

1262
04:24:13,010 --> 04:24:14,450
Into the water

1263
04:24:14,450 --> 04:24:17,379
It will slowly lose health

1264
04:24:17,379 --> 04:24:18,260
Okay

1265
04:24:18,260 --> 04:24:20,579
So in the shade or water it's probably this

1266
04:24:21,620 --> 04:24:25,219
The trebum sense that something was roaming the desert

1267
04:24:26,100 --> 04:24:28,500
Something that did not belong there

1268
04:24:29,479 --> 04:24:34,280
No doubt the eternal cylinder had once again sent forth its cruel servants

1269
04:24:35,639 --> 04:24:41,000
Perhaps it had taken notice of the trebum and was seeking to stop them from accomplishing their goals

1270
04:24:41,799 --> 04:24:49,440
Get in the shade

1271
04:24:49,440 --> 04:24:54,129
Everybody get in the shade

1272
04:24:54,129 --> 04:25:04,719
fuck, um

1273
04:25:04,719 --> 04:25:06,399
Eat this bug

1274
04:25:06,399 --> 04:25:30,690
I don't know. It does just eat it. I can run faster. That's not what i'm really looking for man. Oh shit

1275
04:25:34,520 --> 04:25:44,840
Spray water. Let me get in the temple first

1276
04:25:50,899 --> 04:25:54,850
Wuto

1277
04:25:54,850 --> 04:25:58,020
Shit all over this

1278
04:25:58,020 --> 04:26:00,500
I don't know what this does. Oh my god. It's a super crystal

1279
04:26:01,479 --> 04:26:05,239
Shit, I need to no we're all gonna die. I where where where where where

1280
04:26:06,120 --> 04:26:26,120
This is too stressful. Where's this temple get in it? Go go go go

1281
04:26:27,000 --> 04:26:35,719
Everyone's fine. I wonder if I should break this

1282
04:26:37,159 --> 04:26:39,329
Okay, I broke it

1283
04:26:39,329 --> 04:26:41,409
I don't know what this does but

1284
04:26:42,049 --> 04:27:06,870
I don't know who to give this to. I like the legs. Maybe the cube. Yeah, the cube has been kind of lackluster

1285
04:27:07,270 --> 04:27:12,020
Wait, we got to figure out who we haven't been using and who's gonna get who's who gets the axe here

1286
04:27:12,340 --> 04:27:19,510
I feel like I haven't used you in a while floating head. I haven't used cube in a while

1287
04:27:22,000 --> 04:27:28,020
We even really need the light with this two cube, but this is a jumping cube. I wonder if that matters

1288
04:27:28,659 --> 04:27:30,659
All right. Come here regular cube

1289
04:27:31,430 --> 04:27:45,110
Yep, it's you. I think that's the best way to do it. See what happens

1290
04:27:53,579 --> 04:28:00,899
Camouflage. Well, that doesn't really help

1291
04:28:01,909 --> 04:28:12,819
It's cool, but it doesn't really help. They would all need to have it

1292
04:28:13,540 --> 04:28:31,840
unless I can get the permanent upgrade lots of crystals in here, but

1293
04:28:32,559 --> 04:28:34,930
I really want to spend the time to get them all

1294
04:28:35,010 --> 04:28:51,459
Probably okay. There's some goofy shit in here. I don't know what this does. That's fine. Don't

1295
04:28:52,180 --> 04:28:54,870
Okay, that's the spike one

1296
04:28:55,909 --> 04:28:57,920
this one is

1297
04:28:57,920 --> 04:29:05,280
the shiny and this is

1298
04:29:06,100 --> 04:29:42,209
Um, should I break it? I'm gonna break this sure. Why not? Oh, it's the plated body doesn't resist heat food

1299
04:29:42,610 --> 04:30:06,549
I don't think I need water. Maybe it's health again health stamina wheel. I could do stamina wheel leader also possible

1300
04:30:19,010 --> 04:30:22,950
You're in the desert. You should do water. I didn't even think about that. That's probably a problem

1301
04:30:23,030 --> 04:30:43,120
Yeah, i'll do that. Uh water's the next one, right? No, that's smart smart. I think i'll save the rest

1302
04:30:43,360 --> 04:31:12,079
It's time for some inventory management. Okay, eat all the bullshit that I don't care about this

1303
04:31:16,690 --> 04:31:22,690
I need some of these. I can't get rid of any of this. It's all just crap rid of all of it

1304
04:31:27,879 --> 04:31:42,260
Junk as well. Gunu has the heat management one. Oh, he does

1305
04:31:43,200 --> 04:31:55,670
Okay, I needed three of these though for the mutation. Hold on. Didn't I need to hold on to them though?

1306
04:31:57,120 --> 04:32:09,719
Where is it? I need one. Okay

1307
04:32:11,090 --> 04:32:13,329
Um

1308
04:32:13,329 --> 04:32:17,879
Gunu i'm gonna give it to you and then it should give it to everybody technically, right?

1309
04:32:18,200 --> 04:32:48,309
It's not giving it to everybody because he already had it. That's just for the fire trunk

1310
04:32:48,549 --> 04:33:01,409
Well, it did say heat resistant. That's what the tooltip said a gas-filled membrane that absorbs heat

1311
04:33:02,500 --> 04:33:10,130
Wait a minute that absorbs heat. It doesn't mean you absorb heat if you eat it. Well, great

1312
04:33:10,450 --> 04:33:33,380
Where the hell is it?

1313
04:33:33,380 --> 04:33:39,360
Dude, what is this a menu scroll? There we go. That's because the mouse is on the screen. God damn it

1314
04:33:39,599 --> 04:34:01,400
I don't know. I don't think it does. I don't think we found that thing yet that I need

1315
04:34:01,959 --> 04:34:05,590
But i'm gonna uh, i'm gonna get out of here

1316
04:34:05,750 --> 04:34:22,040
The projection shared a recipe with the trebum one which could protect them from the light of the cylinder's servants crystal

1317
04:34:25,139 --> 04:34:31,200
Camouflage. I think I just have to find it but I need to I feel like i'm gonna be in trouble

1318
04:34:37,080 --> 04:34:38,599
Okay. Well

1319
04:34:38,599 --> 04:34:40,740
Everybody's got full health

1320
04:34:40,819 --> 04:35:01,990
Regen'd cleaned up a couple inventories. Although what about the spike head somebody do that starting to get a there's a lot of different mutations

1321
04:35:01,990 --> 04:35:04,069
And I don't really know what one I should have on

1322
04:35:08,799 --> 04:35:13,240
I'm just gonna hold on to stuff because that's all I do in games like this

1323
04:35:13,319 --> 04:35:49,189
I just hold it forever and I never use it. Look at all these. All right, can't get them all

1324
04:35:50,150 --> 04:36:14,799
You know what? Fuck it. It is fuck it friday after all my tea is almost gone. I've been sipping it this whole time

1325
04:36:15,430 --> 04:36:30,150
It's not yeah, i'm good still hot. I think it is actually working on no, it's not

1326
04:36:33,090 --> 04:36:55,750
All right, we're from here these crystals. I'm gonna suck them all up. Come on. Fuck away from me

1327
04:36:56,310 --> 04:37:11,000
Get out of here. What was that? All right, there's like there's a there's a uh, uh, uh, I was like we gotta go

1328
04:37:11,560 --> 04:37:19,490
I gotta get out of here that whatever that was it's here. But hold on. There's a few more of these I can steal. Come on

1329
04:37:20,819 --> 04:37:30,290
Just one more. All right, I got six one more. Okay, go

1330
04:37:35,729 --> 04:37:39,540
um

1331
04:37:39,540 --> 04:37:54,840
Uh, there's one over there. It's gonna be making a lot of money doing that shit. Okay, I guess I gotta go

1332
04:37:56,000 --> 04:38:24,790
Oh

1333
04:38:24,790 --> 04:38:26,790
Dumb i'm losing time

1334
04:38:43,400 --> 04:38:46,389
Uh

1335
04:38:46,389 --> 04:38:50,069
Holy shit that that just saved everything that just saved the whole entire thing

1336
04:39:04,099 --> 04:39:28,040
Too bad. I want them. Okay

1337
04:39:30,049 --> 04:39:35,119
It didn't come up. It didn't come up. We're good. Okay, we're good. We're good. We're good

1338
04:39:35,119 --> 04:39:44,630
We're good. Just get out of the get out of this domain. Okay get in a good position

1339
04:39:58,310 --> 04:40:02,020
Now what's like sniffing?

1340
04:40:02,259 --> 04:40:06,759
Oh, it's that thing. Okay, get in the right spot and it's over there

1341
04:40:07,240 --> 04:40:37,319
okay, and

1342
04:40:37,319 --> 04:40:50,360
Here we go. Not yet. Let me get right to the edge and

1343
04:41:05,909 --> 04:41:30,310
Actually fucking clean

1344
04:41:30,310 --> 04:41:38,310
All right

1345
04:41:38,310 --> 04:41:43,400
Still hot though. Ah water just chill in here for a little bit

1346
04:41:54,259 --> 04:41:55,060
shit

1347
04:41:55,060 --> 04:42:05,319
Everybody all right. Don't just eat stuff in your inventory, please that stuff is very needed at stuff requests and you ate it

1348
04:42:05,560 --> 04:42:25,520
But idiot still no map. I think i'm all right. Oh, there we go

1349
04:42:25,840 --> 04:42:44,229
Oh, I feel like I can do something with these can I spray these with water or something?

1350
04:42:44,549 --> 04:42:49,750
Maybe I can blow them up. Doesn't it look like I can do something with these

1351
04:42:53,409 --> 04:42:55,409
Please leave me alone

1352
04:43:01,779 --> 04:43:03,779
Did not deter it at all

1353
04:43:04,580 --> 04:43:06,259
Didn't deter it at all

1354
04:43:06,259 --> 04:43:08,020
Didn't deter it at all

1355
04:43:08,020 --> 04:43:10,520
And now we're down in the fucking depths

1356
04:43:13,110 --> 04:43:28,419
Oh, actually, this is kind of good. Maybe I can just suck it up

1357
04:43:33,439 --> 04:43:59,779
Um, nope, why are you looking at me the treban was surprised to see this temple was protected by some sort of

1358
04:43:59,860 --> 04:44:06,290
Breath of the wild kind of is like that, isn't it? Was this some futile attempt to keep out the servants of the cylinder?

1359
04:44:07,090 --> 04:44:09,090
Or was there another reason?

1360
04:44:09,330 --> 04:44:11,330
now lost to history

1361
04:44:11,650 --> 04:44:14,279
Everybody get out of the way. That's a fucking bomb

1362
04:44:15,080 --> 04:44:21,479
I thought it was water shit

1363
04:44:21,720 --> 04:44:22,599
Okay

1364
04:44:22,599 --> 04:44:35,029
No, ah

1365
04:44:35,029 --> 04:44:39,459
Okay

1366
04:44:39,459 --> 04:44:40,819
interesting

1367
04:44:40,819 --> 04:44:48,849
We're very hungry

1368
04:45:02,099 --> 04:45:39,729
Is this going to squish them? How is it? How are you doing it the wrong? I don't can we just roll it

1369
04:45:39,889 --> 04:46:02,900
Is this thing even important camo? I think the camo is only for enemies

1370
04:46:05,569 --> 04:46:11,860
There we go

1371
04:46:11,860 --> 04:46:20,919
This looks to be something new do not do that. Actually, you don't make some bombs or something else

1372
04:46:21,240 --> 04:46:26,310
Here take some like meat still have a cube. So we're fine

1373
04:46:28,040 --> 04:46:38,630
Take these crystals and shit. What else can you turn into meat or bomb? There use this

1374
04:46:41,650 --> 04:46:47,669
I'm fucking I'm like chilled out right now. Who cares?

1375
04:46:50,919 --> 04:46:59,860
I'm so chilled out right now. I think that's fine. All right

1376
04:46:59,860 --> 04:47:00,900
So what does it do?

1377
04:47:00,900 --> 04:47:18,130
I'm afraid for you to eat this because I want you to be the generator of crystals. Somebody's lacking. It's you

1378
04:47:18,689 --> 04:47:25,479
Fair. I know floating is cool, but we haven't needed to use it in like three hours

1379
04:47:39,139 --> 04:47:55,669
camouflage

1380
04:47:55,669 --> 04:48:08,229
Oh, hey, can I change my answer? No, no, I was gonna uh, you know, never mind

1381
04:48:08,549 --> 04:48:42,880
Okay, we want this one to exist because we want to walk up that. Okay. We'll quit screwing it up and nice and hearty

1382
04:48:45,700 --> 04:48:48,580
Oh fucking three head

1383
04:48:48,659 --> 04:48:55,619
Oh fucking three head, right? I think about that

1384
04:48:56,419 --> 04:48:58,580
All the time since last week. I really do

1385
04:48:59,299 --> 04:49:03,360
I'll just be in the shower

1386
04:49:03,360 --> 04:49:05,840
Just washing I just start going

1387
04:49:06,479 --> 04:49:09,599
Oh left but dead. I fucking love that guy, mate

1388
04:49:10,479 --> 04:49:14,000
It's just like fucking left but dead fucking free

1389
04:49:15,200 --> 04:49:21,040
I think uh

1390
04:49:21,040 --> 04:49:26,709
I think you can reach that. Can you reach that?

1391
04:49:28,950 --> 04:49:30,950
Oh, yep

1392
04:49:31,189 --> 04:49:32,610
new power

1393
04:49:32,610 --> 04:49:33,830
Incoming

1394
04:49:33,830 --> 04:49:42,520
Oh my god, we're fucking we don't have any water. We're gonna die. We're gonna starve to thirst. Oh, we need water

1395
04:49:42,840 --> 04:50:01,669
You're gonna get anybody. Oh, okay, dude. How can you not hit that?

1396
04:50:09,139 --> 04:50:11,139
It's right there

1397
04:50:11,220 --> 04:50:26,439
I can't aim higher than this

1398
04:50:26,439 --> 04:50:43,520
Hold on float over there. Ow. Oh, I see I have to move with the uh, cut out

1399
04:50:44,000 --> 04:51:19,990
Let's go. Can you do the minecraft villager herm noise?

1400
04:51:20,770 --> 04:51:23,590
Hmm

1401
04:51:26,979 --> 04:51:34,580
That close I feel like that was pretty close

1402
04:51:48,209 --> 04:51:58,680
Too fast and the travel these curious little shits

1403
04:51:59,599 --> 04:52:05,619
Figured out that the map is leading them to the serpent far away in the oasis

1404
04:52:05,939 --> 04:52:28,639
Will they be able to reach in time? Uh, I can leave I do need water though. I need my uh smoker

1405
04:52:47,560 --> 04:52:49,720
Ooh

1406
04:52:49,720 --> 04:52:52,520
Oh, dude, look at how many crystals are back here

1407
04:52:58,450 --> 04:53:28,240
You know what to do suck them up and water. Thank god. All right

1408
04:53:31,330 --> 04:53:41,159
No, I don't want you to do that. This should give me probably three or four crystals

1409
04:53:41,479 --> 04:53:58,119
I am excited. So we're gonna have to wait here for a minute. It's getting kind of late might um, call it here soon

1410
04:53:58,439 --> 04:54:00,439
maybe at the next uh

1411
04:54:01,040 --> 04:54:17,650
Checkpoint, you know, i'm telling you i've been loving these after six o'clock just kind of nighttime streams. I love it

1412
04:54:17,970 --> 04:54:36,869
I wonder how much is left. I'm over another few hours. Maybe you should finish it tonight. Uh,

1413
04:54:39,430 --> 04:54:40,849
I don't know

1414
04:54:40,849 --> 04:55:00,680
We'll see what what happens when I get to the next checkpoint something to look forward to after work and leave this point got everything

1415
04:55:05,159 --> 04:55:08,560
This uh, buddy is going to be turning out crystals

1416
04:55:09,119 --> 04:55:30,740
That's fantastic. All right, let's get to the next tower. There's a decent chunk left

1417
04:55:30,819 --> 04:55:36,130
This is the area which you just started in a whole nother area. I imagine probably another few hours

1418
04:55:36,610 --> 04:55:47,009
It's probably three or four hours. I'll finish it up. Don't worry. All right, I got the map

1419
04:55:48,229 --> 04:55:53,110
Weirdly enough, there is no tower. So that's kind of scary. Wait, maybe this one over here

1420
04:55:53,270 --> 04:56:11,009
Did I go down this hole? I don't remember. I was kind of panicking. I don't think I went down this hole

1421
04:56:12,930 --> 04:56:39,189
I didn't have it revealed. No, I definitely didn't there it is. It's at least another few hours. Yeah, that's all good

1422
04:56:41,159 --> 04:57:18,580
I'll finish it. I got a lot of crystals. That's a scary thing happening and I don't know what's going on

1423
04:57:18,580 --> 04:57:42,470
But they're not still up there, right? No, I don't think it doesn't count unless I can see them. Nice. It's a long game

1424
04:57:43,029 --> 04:57:46,310
Um, I don't think it's a long game. I think it's just

1425
04:57:47,909 --> 04:57:49,909
12 hours 14 hours 15 hours

1426
04:57:53,669 --> 04:58:06,310
All right. There it is

1427
04:58:06,310 --> 04:58:14,419
I'm gonna have like 25 crystals. We need to find one of those things. All right

1428
04:58:14,580 --> 04:58:20,740
I think I just have to go wait. We need to eat. I'm gonna have any food

1429
04:58:20,979 --> 04:58:29,279
I know but I don't want to get rid of those. All right, where's where's grapple?

1430
04:58:29,520 --> 04:58:59,189
All right grapple. You need to feed us. Oh, there are stakes here. I want full stomach full water

1431
04:59:01,759 --> 04:59:11,840
Oh, I don't want to cross there. No, no, no this way you to feed yourself. I'll be good. I think uh,

1432
04:59:12,400 --> 04:59:18,080
Holly was talking about making curry tonight, so that's gonna be dog champ

1433
04:59:28,799 --> 04:59:30,799
I love curry. It's so good

1434
04:59:31,439 --> 04:59:34,689
so easy

1435
04:59:34,689 --> 04:59:36,130
Get a fucking onion

1436
04:59:36,130 --> 04:59:38,069
potatoes

1437
04:59:38,069 --> 04:59:39,110
carrots

1438
04:59:39,110 --> 04:59:45,090
Mix in that shit. Oh, it's so good. It's such like a nice

1439
04:59:46,069 --> 04:59:47,639
filling

1440
04:59:47,639 --> 04:59:49,479
party dinner

1441
04:59:49,479 --> 04:59:52,159
with rice too

1442
04:59:52,159 --> 04:59:56,450
curry at 11 pm

1443
04:59:57,650 --> 05:00:02,119
What's wrong with that?

1444
05:00:02,119 --> 05:00:04,119
What the fuck?

1445
05:00:04,119 --> 05:00:06,360
Holy shit, that was terrifying

1446
05:00:07,159 --> 05:00:09,159
That was actually terrifying

1447
05:00:10,080 --> 05:00:13,599
Um, okay. Well that exists. Oh that just happened

1448
05:00:15,319 --> 05:00:16,840
I'm sorry

1449
05:00:16,840 --> 05:00:19,919

Seeing the celestial trawalla

The trebum were reminded of all the many creatures that had fallen before the cylinder

1459
05:00:56,900 --> 05:01:02,099
Somewhere out there waited an elder who did not know of his siblings fate

1460
05:01:02,900 --> 05:01:06,900
And the trebum is sad the weight of the bad news they carried

1461
05:01:07,540 --> 05:01:10,209
Oh, no

1462
05:01:10,209 --> 05:01:29,720
Somebody else is fucking dead. Hold on a second guys. We're going back

Seeing the celestial trawalla

1474

The trebum were reminded of all the many creatures that had fallen before the cylinder. Please leave us alone

1475
05:03:41,479 --> 05:03:46,680
Somewhere out there waited an elder who did not know of his siblings fate

1476
05:03:47,560 --> 05:03:51,479
And the trebum felt the weight of the bad news they carried

1477
05:03:54,400 --> 05:04:01,889

1489
05:05:33,700 --> 05:05:37,439
Where it all started i've been really enjoying these

1490
05:05:44,000 --> 05:05:48,419
The old days

1491
05:05:48,419 --> 05:05:55,139
Thank you for being honest. I gotta be honest. I love this. Yeah, don't want to go too too late

1492
05:05:55,459 --> 05:05:57,189
Thanks for watching everybody

1493
05:05:57,189 --> 05:06:07,029
We will conclude the eternal cylinder on sunday evening, which is just about a day and some change from now. We'll see you soon

1494
05:06:09,919 --> 05:06:22,869
Night streamer andy i'm very curious of the conclusion. We'll see it on sunday

1495
05:06:23,110 --> 05:06:44,900
I'm gonna go eat see in a day to go to the other screen. Appreciate you sticking around

1496
05:06:45,299 --> 05:06:52,659
I know this kind of new change of schedule is um and change of pace appreciate you hanging out though

1497
05:06:59,560 --> 05:07:11,250
Teabags are out teabags are right here. You eat hamburger helper on the toilet

1498
05:07:11,490 --> 05:07:15,479
I can't think of anything worse to eat on the toilet

1499
05:07:15,560 --> 05:07:23,139
That sounds like the worst possible food option for when you're in the bathroom

1500
05:07:26,560 --> 05:07:31,750
Maybe tacos would be second. I mean, maybe tacos would be worse

1501
05:07:35,080 --> 05:07:38,599
Well, it depends if it's a like a taco or a burrito burrito would be fine

1502
05:07:39,080 --> 05:07:45,220
Why am I even answering this question that you just asked like this is a real question that I have to ask

1503
05:07:45,619 --> 05:07:47,599
I have to answer

1504
05:07:47,599 --> 05:07:49,599
There's no reason to answer this question

1505
05:07:49,680 --> 05:07:56,360
I'm gonna just let it roll by in the chat. It would have just been gone, but here we are

1506
05:07:56,680 --> 05:08:15,040
You have a strange attraction to very weird comments. It's fun to read the goofy stuff. I like it

1507
05:08:24,529 --> 05:08:25,729
Yeah, have a good night

1508
05:08:25,729 --> 05:08:31,669
See you for the oh and by the way

1509
05:08:31,669 --> 05:08:35,270

1510
05:08:36,790 --> 05:08:37,669
so

1511
05:08:37,669 --> 05:08:49,220
Maybe we'll start something else on sunday or maybe we'll do more breath of the wild or

1512
05:08:49,779 --> 05:08:52,919
Frog detective. I keep seeing pizza tower

1513
05:08:53,479 --> 05:08:58,880
Maybe i'll do pizza star. I have to finish breath of the wild though

1514
05:08:59,439 --> 05:09:04,049
