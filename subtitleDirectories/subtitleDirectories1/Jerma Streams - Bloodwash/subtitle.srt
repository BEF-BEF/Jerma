1
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,620
I fixed it. I fixed it. Okay. Hi.

2
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:24,920
Hey, how are you?

3
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,480
Actually muted. Not anymore.

4
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,179
How do I sound?

5
00:00:31,179 --> 00:00:32,579
What do you guys think?

6
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:36,600
Do you like the new audio? Do you think it sounds alright?

7
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,189
How does it sound?

8
00:00:39,189 --> 00:00:43,149
Welcome back. How are you?

9
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:44,850
It sounds like shit.

10
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,850
It does not sound like shit, okay?

11
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,950
By the way, I only stream every three or four days.

12
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,149
So, I already know the joke.

13
00:00:55,149 --> 00:00:57,149
I already know the funny joke.

14
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:06,599
To put the mute thing up.

15
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,920
You sound like you're in my head. Please get out of here.

16
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,439
You sound like old Jerma.

17
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,870
It sounds too clean.

18
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,670
It does sound worse.

19
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,670
No, it doesn't.

20
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,269
You know what the funniest part about this?

21
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:26,569
In like three days, you guys will get used to this.

22
00:01:26,569 --> 00:01:34,439
And it'll just be normal.

23
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,340
You sound like a 16-year-old.

24
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,840
What the fuck are you talking about?

25
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,370
Hold on. Let me listen to it. Let me see how it sounds.

26
00:01:41,370 --> 00:02:13,129
You sound like 2010 Andy.

27
00:02:13,129 --> 00:02:15,229
This is what I hear.

28
00:02:15,229 --> 00:02:16,629
Okay?

29
00:02:16,729 --> 00:02:22,629
I am a quarter of a second delayed in my head.

30
00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:28,849
So, I'm listening to myself talking

31
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:49,620
and I'm a quarter of a second delayed in my head.

32
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,219
Okay, I have to mute that.

33
00:02:51,219 --> 00:03:02,210
I was hearing myself in my ears a quarter of a second after I talked.

34
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:06,530
Okay. You sound like a librarian.

35
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:07,530
I don't sound like a librarian.

36
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:08,930
Look, it's going to take a little bit of tweaking.

37
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,830
I just got it set up.

38
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:11,830
It's going to take some tweaking.

39
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,360
It's going to take some finagling.

40
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,009
It's fine.

41
00:03:18,009 --> 00:03:23,430
You sound like a podcast host.

42
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,629
Well, okay, what's worse podcast host

43
00:03:25,629 --> 00:03:28,430
or Jerma, please go back to the setup you had.

44
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:32,689
You sound like you were in my bathroom.

45
00:03:32,689 --> 00:03:35,259
I don't think there's any compression even on.

46
00:03:35,259 --> 00:03:37,159
All right. Let's do a test. Ready?

47
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:38,729
You guys can help me.

48
00:03:38,729 --> 00:03:40,330
All right. This is going to be a quick test.

49
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:45,479
We're going to see how you guys feel about this.

50
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:48,520
How do you guys feel about this?

51
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,319
I turned off some setting

52
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,719
and now it sounds probably really awful.

53
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:56,490
That sounds better.

54
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:57,590
That's perfect.

55
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:00,780
It sounds like an Xbox 360.

56
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,780
Your voice is too crackly.

57
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,580
It sounds exactly the same.

58
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:08,159
Worse.

59
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,090
It sounds the same.

60
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,289
Okay.

61
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:12,530
How about now?

62
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:15,259
How does that sound?

63
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:16,459
Do you guys like this better?

64
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:18,459
Are you happier with this setup?

65
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:19,660
Does this sound better?

66
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:24,449
If I were to turn it up?

67
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:25,250
It's very quiet.

68
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,750
Well, okay.

69
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,449
So how about this?

70
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:29,550
You tell me. You tell me.

71
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,550
We'll figure this out.

72
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,519
We'll figure this out.

73
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:33,519
How do you sound now?

74
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:37,199
How you doing?

75
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,480
Now you're too loud.

76
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,660
Sound like a podcaster.

77
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,959
That sounds really good.

78
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:48,079
That was better before.

79
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,180
I can't tell the difference.

80
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,079
How do you sound?

81
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:55,860
It's really too quiet.

82
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,160
You sound like SpongeBob.

83
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,050
What?

84
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:07,560
It sounds like SpongeBob?

85
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,759
Somebody said that's good,

86
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:10,759
but you have the mute thing on.

87
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:12,060
So you're full of shit.

88
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,660
And look, there's no compressor on now.

89
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,860
So if I get loud, it's going to hurt your ears.

90
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,060
Hold on.

91
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,160
I have to...

92
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,959
We're going back to this one.

93
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:20,160
Oh my God.

94
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,660
Okay.

95
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,560
All right. I don't fucking care.

96
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,759
My audio setup has sucked asshole

97
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,459
since I started fucking YouTube back in like 2010.

98
00:05:28,459 --> 00:05:29,459
Okay.

99
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:30,759
Are you really here for the audio?

100
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:31,860
Are you here for the audio?

101
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,060
Are you here for the audio?

102
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,870
Is that what you're here for?

103
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,279
Huh?

104
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,480
You're here for the audio?

105
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,180
I look like my fucking dad.

106
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,209
Hold on.

107
00:05:46,209 --> 00:05:51,379
Are you even here for the audio?

108
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:52,939
Okay. There we go.

109
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:53,339
How do you...

110
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:54,240
I think that sounds fine.

111
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:54,839
Let me listen to it.

112
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:56,970
Let me see how it sounds.

113
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:57,769
Let me get it.

114
00:05:57,769 --> 00:06:01,389
I haven't changed my audio setup in like fucking four and a half years.

115
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:02,579
Okay.

116
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:03,680
I think this sounds fine.

117
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,319
This really does.

118
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:06,519
Holy shit.

119
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:08,480
Complainer Andes.

120
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,879
This sounds fucking fine.

121
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:11,480
This sounds flawless.

122
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,379
If I get a little closer to the microphone,

123
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:15,709
by the way, it's up here now.

124
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,850
This sounds fucking flawless.

125
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:18,449
This sounds...

126
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:20,139
Let me get loud.

127
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:20,839
It's too...

128
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,180
It's too loud.

129
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,279
Oh, it's too loud.

130
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,480
Oh, it's too soft.

131
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,680
I need the band that's just right.

132
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,639
Hold on.

133
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:36,569
A bunch of fucking Goldilocks Andes.

134
00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:42,339
I have to stop monitoring because I can't even talk.

135
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:44,439
How many times am I going to say Andy in the same day?

136
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:45,600
Okay.

137
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,000
I think it sounds great.

138
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,300
I'm ready.

139
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:53,759
That last bit sounded weird when you went high-pitched.

140
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,459
Microphones are fucking stupid.

141
00:06:55,459 --> 00:06:56,360
Microphones suck.

142
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,060
And like you're in a different place too.

143
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:58,660
I moved my...

144
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,759
Look, this is here.

145
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:00,660
It's in the way.

146
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,060
Look at this.

147
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,459
I don't even want to move it because I got it on the right spot.

148
00:07:03,459 --> 00:07:05,689
This thing is aiming at me.

149
00:07:05,689 --> 00:07:08,569
I have this thing that's like aiming directly at me.

150
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:12,040
It's literally aiming at me.

151
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,279
It's freaking me out.

152
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:15,680
It actually is kind of freaking me out.

153
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,139
This thing is literally aiming at me like a cannon.

154
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:22,990
Dude, you got a duck.

155
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,350
All right, we're good.

156
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,750
You sound like you have auto-tune on.

157
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,649
No, I do not.

158
00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:27,149
I do not.

159
00:07:27,149 --> 00:07:30,350
I sat there for fucking an hour holding my hands like this

160
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:34,750
and talking and going like ABCDE, ABCDE, ABCDE.

161
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,319
And I was like, that sounds fine.

162
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:43,089
So we're going to keep it the way it is.

163
00:07:43,089 --> 00:07:49,199
Check the gain.

164
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,470
I think it's fine.

165
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,329
It's fine.

166
00:07:53,329 --> 00:07:55,129
Look, I have to turn my gain up because...

167
00:07:55,129 --> 00:08:02,220
Look, listen.

168
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,759
Why can't I talk?

169
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,920
This is like froze up.

170
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,120
Listen to me.

171
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,920
Where? There you are.

172
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,019
You're in a different spot now.

173
00:08:09,019 --> 00:08:11,120
Like the chat's like over here now.

174
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,120
Like you're over there.

175
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,920
I don't like this new thing.

176
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,319
I'm going back to what it was in 2012

177
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,300
when I used to hold the mic like this

178
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:23,240
because I didn't have a mic stand.

179
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,040
The laugh had a distortion on it.

180
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,779
Well, we'll figure it out some other day.

181
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:30,980
My audio has been too low.

182
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:34,610
People have complained about how I'm not loud enough.

183
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,509
It seems that the laugh had a tinny sound.

184
00:08:36,509 --> 00:08:37,450
Hold on.

185
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:38,450
I know. Look, trust me.

186
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:39,649
We'll get on with it.

187
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:41,139
Just hold on.

188
00:08:41,139 --> 00:08:42,240
Let me see.

189
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,210
So when I laughed, it was a tinny sound.

190
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:52,279
Oh my God.

191
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:54,769
That is weird.

192
00:08:56,139 --> 00:08:56,639
What the fuck?

193
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:59,019
Why is it doing that?

194
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,320
You're the loudest person on Twitch?

195
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,419
No, I'm not.

196
00:09:08,419 --> 00:09:10,940
Why is it doing that?

197
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,039
Why is it doing that?

198
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:17,370
Shit.

199
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:17,970
I'm sorry, guys.

200
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,500
I didn't sit there.

201
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,500
I didn't sit there and put my headphones in

202
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,500
and sit there and go...

203
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,840
Like what am I doing in here?

204
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,139
You need to refund it.

205
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,240
Am I too loud?

206
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,779
But everybody says I'm too soft.

207
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:35,879
The gain is too high.

208
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:37,279
All right, I'm going to turn the gain down

209
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:43,230
and then we're going to get this right.

210
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,440
We'll get it right.

211
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,120
Okay, you ready?

212
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,720
Boom.

213
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,519
How's that?

214
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,059
How are we feeling about this one?

215
00:09:49,059 --> 00:09:50,059
How do we feel about this?

216
00:09:50,059 --> 00:09:51,899
Do we feel pretty good about this?

217
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:54,950
Are we feeling better about this?

218
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,830
This is literally perfect right now.

219
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,110
Okay, we have to do a test.

220
00:10:01,409 --> 00:10:02,610
Oh, I fucking hate that.

221
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:07,559
Get off camera.

222
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:09,840
The laugh is still weird.

223
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,740
I think that was a weird laugh, man.

224
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:18,190
Does that sound weird?

225
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,389
You have a distortion filter on.

226
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:20,190
I actually, I really don't.

227
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:22,429
I promise, I really don't.

228
00:10:22,429 --> 00:10:23,429
It's phasing.

229
00:10:23,429 --> 00:10:25,779
Yeah, why is it phasing?

230
00:10:25,779 --> 00:10:27,429
Whatever.

231
00:10:27,429 --> 00:10:28,429
Look, the game we're playing

232
00:10:28,429 --> 00:10:29,929
is wicked fucked up today anyways.

233
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:35,620
So look, just pretend it's part of the VHS filter.

234
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,519
Yeah, who gives a shit?

235
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:38,899
Let's go.

236
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:42,679
I'll get it right.

237
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:45,940
It's trying to cut off your weird voices.

238
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,740
Why?

239
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:51,360
That's weird.

240
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,159
All right, I just came in here to do some settings.

241
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:55,769
Should I turn the filter off?

242
00:10:55,769 --> 00:10:57,269
Should I turn the VHS filter off?

243
00:10:57,269 --> 00:11:00,769
Or what?

244
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:07,730
I mean, everyone hates this, don't they?

245
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,730
Turn it off and lights off too.

246
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:14,360
All the lights are off in my whole house.

247
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,460
Just don't laugh or don't make any weird sounds.

248
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,259
I'll figure out the weird sound filter

249
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:21,080
that I have for no reason.

250
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,950
Your mic thinks your noises are inhuman

251
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:29,159
and is filtering them out.

252
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:35,039
That's so stupid.

253
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:39,700
Whatever, I'm getting caught by a weird noise filter?

254
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,799
I don't have a noise gate on.

255
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:43,799
I don't have a compressor on right now either.

256
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:48,899
I think this just hates me.

257
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:50,299
The VHS filter kind of hurts my head.

258
00:11:50,299 --> 00:11:52,970
I'll keep the CRT filter on.

259
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,169
If anyone has to complain about that,

260
00:11:54,169 --> 00:11:55,169
then get in line,

261
00:11:55,169 --> 00:11:58,899
because I have a lot of announcements to make today.

262
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,399
Hold on, what?

263
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:00,600
I'm not even fucking ready to stream yet.

264
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,750
I got a lot of things to talk about.

265
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,549
Yeah, I'm not even ready yet.

266
00:12:05,549 --> 00:12:08,389
Hold on, give me a second.

267
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:13,320
I have some announcements.

268
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,830
Announcement number one.

269
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:17,690
Are you ready?

270
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:21,309
Over the next day or so, next couple of days,

271
00:12:21,309 --> 00:12:23,639
we are going to be officially...

272
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:24,440
Officially...

273
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:28,059
Did that sound weird?

274
00:12:28,059 --> 00:12:33,779
I just coughed normally.

275
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:39,350
Green screen part three, the finale.

276
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:43,340
The final green screen stream

277
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,980
is coming in the next week or two.

278
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:50,529
I'm going back in front of the screen one last time.

279
00:12:50,529 --> 00:12:55,529
One final time ever.

280
00:12:55,529 --> 00:12:56,629
So what's going to happen is,

281
00:12:56,629 --> 00:12:57,929
just like in previous years,

282
00:12:57,929 --> 00:13:02,909
in the Discord, you are going to go to the Discord.

283
00:13:02,909 --> 00:13:05,509
The channel has to be created and has to be...

284
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:08,350
The rules need to be pinned up and everything.

285
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:09,950
But I need actions.

286
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:11,950
I need things that you want me to do.

287
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:12,850
Just like in previous years,

288
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:16,350
we're going to have people curate a ton of actions.

289
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,750
I, myself, am going to go do some things as well.

290
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,620
I'm going to make my own actions up.

291
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,620
Please do all the Fortnite dances.

292
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:26,019
Well, let me just be very clear.

293
00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:28,929
This is the last time this is ever happening.

294
00:13:28,929 --> 00:13:31,029
Three times in front of the green screen.

295
00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:31,629
There you go.

296
00:13:31,629 --> 00:13:33,779
That's it.

297
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:36,039
We'll have the whole trilogy.

298
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:39,669
And I'm going to do a green screen movie night

299
00:13:39,669 --> 00:13:43,940
at some point in June.

300
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,139
I will tell you the hard date

301
00:13:45,139 --> 00:13:46,539
that I'm going to go in front of the screen,

302
00:13:46,539 --> 00:13:49,639
but for now, let's just make this really, really...

303
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:52,340
My microphone socks, dude.

304
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,740
We'll make this really easy.

305
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,840
And just, if you have actions,

306
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,039
I would like to see you do this.

307
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:58,440
I would like to see you do this.

308
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,240
We're going to have a discussion channel to open up

309
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,809
in some ways you guys can figure out what you want me to do.

310
00:14:04,809 --> 00:14:06,590
I'll give you more info soon.

311
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:09,480
What's the status on baseball?

312
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,389
July 14th?

313
00:14:11,389 --> 00:14:12,690
The baseball stream is happening.

314
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:13,490
July 14th?

315
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,190
That's all you need to know.

316
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,950
I'm not telling you anything else.

317
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:21,529
Please use multiple outfits.

318
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:22,629
Do this, IRL.

319
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:25,539
I just did!

320
00:14:25,539 --> 00:14:27,740
Yeah, a lot of Discord users probably covered it right now.

321
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,840
I don't think it's there yet.

322
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:33,500
I just want to talk about it now.

323
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,879
The second thing I want to talk about is Otto.

324
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:37,980
Otto was doing way better.

325
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,360
If you don't, if you missed the past weekend,

326
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,600
Otto had a UTI

327
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,600
and it was actually really, really awful.

328
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,559
Really sad.

329
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:48,659
He was throwing up.

330
00:14:48,659 --> 00:14:53,659
He was peeing 10, 20 times in a couple of hours.

331
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,059
He was constantly every 5, 10 minutes.

332
00:14:55,059 --> 00:14:55,960
I got to go out. I got to go out.

333
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,440
I got to go out.

334
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,740
It's like, all right, well, let's see what's going on.

335
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:03,639
So I kind of canceled the whole weekend worth of streams

336
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:07,570
and we're picking up this horror stuff I was supposed to do two days ago.

337
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:12,240
But he's been put on an antibiotic and he is way better.

338
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,639
I would say he's pretty much back to normal.

339
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:16,490
He is almost 100% normal now.

340
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,289
So that's really good too.

341
00:15:18,289 --> 00:15:20,480
Really happy about that.

342
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,480
The other thing I want to talk about,

343
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,679
let's talk about this.

344
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:28,679
The archive channel, the VOD channel,

345
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:31,080
you know, the German archive channel on YouTube

346
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,960
that you've come to know and love over the years,

347
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:38,360
is now officially an official channel

348
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:42,710
that has been absorbed into the German network.

349
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:45,009
So that's really, really cool too.

350
00:15:45,009 --> 00:15:46,909
If you don't know what I'm talking about,

351
00:15:46,909 --> 00:15:53,320
the archive channel has been uploading every stream I've ever done.

352
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:58,220
And I mean, they're dating back to like 2014, 2015.

353
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:04,360
Every single one.

354
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,759
You need to upload the...

355
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,059
Guys, I don't even have access.

356
00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:12,659
Okay, people are like, hey dude, back in like 2013,

357
00:16:12,659 --> 00:16:14,759
you did like a stream.

358
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:16,159
You have like access to that stream.

359
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:17,960
Like we kind of want to see it.

360
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:23,789
It's like, bro, I don't even know what computer I uploaded that on.

361
00:16:23,789 --> 00:16:28,149
You know, I have no fucking idea.

362
00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:29,850
I have no idea.

363
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:34,649
Hey dude, you played like Diablo back in like 2012 on stream on YouTube.

364
00:16:34,649 --> 00:16:37,190
You have any like idea where I can find that?

365
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:38,590
I know.

366
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:40,789
I don't know where that would be.

367
00:16:40,789 --> 00:16:55,710
I have no fucking idea.

368
00:16:55,710 --> 00:17:01,230
Only three German channels.

369
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,730
Hey, back in 2013, you did a stream.

370
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,529
You have backup of that stream because a lot of us would like to see it.

371
00:17:05,529 --> 00:17:07,130
I have no fucking idea.

372
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:07,730
Because I don't even know.

373
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,930
I don't remember what even happened at breakfast yesterday.

374
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:12,930
You think I remember what like hard drive from 10 years ago

375
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:14,829
that I had some stream on it maybe?

376
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:17,930
I don't fucking know.

377
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:19,829
Can we see the baseball stream in person?

378
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:21,579
No.

379
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:35,180
No.

380
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,380
Sag.

381
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,680
What about baseball merch?

382
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,480
They will be baseball merch.

383
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,450
A lot of it.

384
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:44,549
And I'm really excited for it because it's going to be.

385
00:17:44,549 --> 00:17:45,049
Oh man.

386
00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:46,829
What do the kids say?

387
00:17:46,829 --> 00:17:47,829
It's going to be.

388
00:17:47,829 --> 00:17:51,029
Give me some things that the kids say so I can sound fucking cool right now.

389
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:51,730
What?

390
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:52,230
I'm serious.

391
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:55,930
They're going to be some of the best merch you've ever seen in your whole life.

392
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:57,730
It's going to be awesome.

393
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:01,009
Now, let's add a style right now.

394
00:18:01,009 --> 00:18:02,410
Bustin'.

395
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:04,400
There you go.

396
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,069
Oh man, you're going to be wanting to take like fucking pictures of this.

397
00:18:08,069 --> 00:18:09,069
This is going to be so sick.

398
00:18:09,069 --> 00:18:11,420
Trust me.

399
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:11,920
All right.

400
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,420
I got another thing to talk about because this is something that I wanted to address.

401
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:21,259
You probably noticed a few days ago or a week ago now that I VIP'd some new people

402
00:18:21,259 --> 00:18:24,759
and revoked VIP for all those people.

403
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:26,160
Well, some of them.

404
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,259
And it's a very important reason for that.

405
00:18:28,259 --> 00:18:33,259
As you know, over the last three years or so, where's mine?

406
00:18:33,259 --> 00:18:36,529
Precisely what I'm about to talk about.

407
00:18:36,529 --> 00:18:40,930
So VIP has been in this weird place in the channel for the last three or four years or so

408
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:43,329
because I haven't really given it to really anybody.

409
00:18:43,329 --> 00:18:46,130
I mean, maybe a few times during random streams and whatever,

410
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:49,529
but besides the community leader stuff in the Discord,

411
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:51,329
I haven't really given it to anybody.

412
00:18:51,329 --> 00:18:56,529
And what I realized and what I'm going to kind of change my rules here,

413
00:18:56,529 --> 00:19:00,490
I'm not giving VIP to anybody ever again.

414
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:07,250
And there's very few specific reasons why I cannot pick and choose people in this community.

415
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:14,130
It seems like if I give VIP to somebody, there might be 10 other people that are disappointed.

416
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:16,430
There might be a hundred people that deserve it.

417
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:20,289
But how can I possibly do that?

418
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:23,789
Since this, I mean, there are 16,000 people here right now.

419
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:28,390
Ever since this channel grew two or three times in the last two or three years,

420
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:31,990
I cannot reliably pick out even probably a hundred of you that I would be like,

421
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:34,190
okay, should I? You've done this.

422
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,690
You've been around. You've said this.

423
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,390
You've been like an active member of the...

424
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:39,589
There's just too many people I could give it to.

425
00:19:39,589 --> 00:19:43,160
So no one's going to get it.

426
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,359
Just no one's going to get VIP anymore.

427
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:51,259
Unless you are somebody that I really need to see you,

428
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:56,059
but like another streamer or a game dev comes in or whatever, right?

429
00:19:56,059 --> 00:19:59,910
And I want to see them like in the chat.

430
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:05,089
This is communism.

431
00:20:05,089 --> 00:20:06,390
This is what do you mean communism?

432
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,690
I'm literally removing it from everybody.

433
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:12,660
I'm not giving it to everybody.

434
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:17,339
That's not, what are you talking about?

435
00:20:17,339 --> 00:20:19,240
Durama, communist move.

436
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,670
Mad, communist.

437
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:28,049
Actually, that's not communism.

438
00:20:28,049 --> 00:20:30,450
I'm about to disturb my microphone.

439
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:33,630
Don't get me loud.

440
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:37,160
Don't make me distort my microphone.

441
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,059
No, but in all seriousness, no, it's too hard to pick.

442
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:42,259
And I don't want people will get pissed off at each other.

443
00:20:42,259 --> 00:20:47,519
And I already see the issues of,

444
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:50,619
hey, this person got VIP.

445
00:20:50,619 --> 00:20:52,299
Why didn't I get it?

446
00:20:52,299 --> 00:20:54,799
Or this person doesn't deserve it for XYZ.

447
00:20:54,799 --> 00:21:01,180
And it's like, I just don't even want to do it.

448
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,380
There's too many people to give it to.

449
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,680
Too many people I could give it to.

450
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,700
So I'm just not going to give it to anybody.

451
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:14,200
You understand?

452
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,380
No cap, your mic is ass.

453
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:24,109
VIP that person for an hour.

454
00:21:24,109 --> 00:21:25,910
The nuclear option.

455
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,410
But sometimes you have to do the nuclear option.

456
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,950
You really do.

457
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:34,150
I don't want to have, I don't want to give VIP to five people

458
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:38,250
and have five other people then like get mad at those five people

459
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,349
and cause ripples through the community of people

460
00:21:41,349 --> 00:21:43,750
that are just pissed off that they don't have it

461
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,319
or that they don't think somebody deserves it.

462
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:47,720
For real.

463
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,519
I don't want to cause this big pick,

464
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:54,420
Jerma's picking favorites and he gave it to this person,

465
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,619
but not to this person.

466
00:21:55,619 --> 00:21:56,519
It's a huge problem.

467
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:57,420
It really could be.

468
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:01,019
And so I don't even want to have it be a problem.

469
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:02,019
And this is a horror game night.

470
00:22:02,019 --> 00:22:08,759
So you should be fucking scared.

471
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:10,160
You have a webcam mic on.

472
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:14,380
I don't, there's no webcam mic on right now.

473
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,380
You know how angry,

474
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:21,869
you know how angry that just made me what you just said?

475
00:22:21,869 --> 00:22:24,269
You guys are going to get used to it.

476
00:22:24,269 --> 00:22:26,869
New things are evil and awful, right?

477
00:22:27,769 --> 00:22:29,369
Remember when I had the new audio setup

478
00:22:29,369 --> 00:22:31,569
and everyone told me that like I'm the worst streamer

479
00:22:31,569 --> 00:22:33,700
on the website.

480
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,000
I remember looking over at chat

481
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,599
and people on my other audio setup

482
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:39,099
that you've gotten used to over the last two to three years.

483
00:22:39,099 --> 00:22:40,000
Right?

484
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,099
Somebody brought like this paragraph.

485
00:22:42,099 --> 00:22:43,700
I might be making this up.

486
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,599
I don't know, I could be,

487
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:45,599
but like I swear to God,

488
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:47,200
I looked over and someone was like, dude,

489
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,700
like you're like probably the worst fucking Twitch streamer

490
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,599
like quality wise and professional wise or something.

491
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:54,299
And I'm just like, what the, what the hell?

492
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:00,250
Let's go.

493
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,549
Why is this here?

494
00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:06,799
I don't know, this is a mystery that we need to solve.

495
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,099
Can you guys help me with this mystery?

496
00:23:08,099 --> 00:23:13,099
Why is there a chili cheese Frito here on my desk?

497
00:23:14,539 --> 00:23:17,910
But what, why is this here?

498
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:19,509
I'm not gonna eat it, what if it hit the ground?

499
00:23:19,509 --> 00:23:23,200
Why is it in here?

500
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,799
The mic censored, fuck, or did you not say it?

501
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:29,819
I don't know.

502
00:23:29,819 --> 00:23:32,119
He saves all his production value for the big streams.

503
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,930
Thank you, thank you.

504
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:37,460
I appreciate that.

505
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,559
All right, this is blood wash.

506
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,710
It's a scary game about, I don't know.

507
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:42,609
People told me to play this.

508
00:23:42,609 --> 00:23:44,809
People said, hey dude, play this game and it's scary.

509
00:23:44,809 --> 00:23:45,809
And I've been sitting here for 30 minutes.

510
00:23:45,809 --> 00:24:11,549
So what production value?

511
00:24:11,549 --> 00:24:21,480
So I'll have to say about that.

512
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,980
How do you not know what I'm doing?

513
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:23,880
What a day.

514
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,680
There's people talking.

515
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,880
Professor Watt was his usual miserable self

516
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,000
and that test was a killer.

517
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:39,680
Like I can just rocks and.

518
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,779
Are you fucking kidding me?

519
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:43,309
Liam didn't do the laundry or clean.

520
00:24:43,309 --> 00:24:45,009
I'll have to do a load of laundry.

521
00:24:45,009 --> 00:24:45,849
What are you?

522
00:24:45,849 --> 00:24:47,210
I have an interview for a job tomorrow

523
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:50,039
and have nothing to wear.

524
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:52,849
Those, no, I'm doing the thing.

525
00:24:52,849 --> 00:25:05,210
I'm doing the thing, that fucking meme.

526
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:08,740
Okay, I actually just did it.

527
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,740
I, whatever, I don't care.

528
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,579
Let's go.

529
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:13,400
I'll gather these clothes up

530
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,329
and head to the laundry room in the basement.

531
00:25:15,329 --> 00:25:18,910
I'm going to have to be too upset and tired

532
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,009
to go through it again.

533
00:25:20,109 --> 00:25:21,009
Let me pay attention to this

534
00:25:21,009 --> 00:25:24,200
because this is important.

535
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,039
I need to pay attention.

536
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,500
This is a scary game and you're fucking with me.

537
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:30,380
Do I turn the volume down on this?

538
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,279
Do I turn it up or down?

539
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,380
This is one of those games

540
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:36,089
that's going to blow my eardrums out, right?

541
00:25:36,089 --> 00:25:37,619
I'm scared.

542
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,119
That's why I'm not scared of the jump scares.

543
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:43,680
I'm scared of my ears hurting.

544
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,859
Okay, haven't had time to unpack yet.

545
00:25:47,859 --> 00:25:50,579
Not sure when I will.

546
00:25:50,579 --> 00:26:02,980
He did that on purpose.

547
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,859
Not really, actually.

548
00:26:05,859 --> 00:26:07,559
I mean, I got like halfway through it

549
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:09,059
and then I realized that I was doing it.

550
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:11,220
So I was like, fucking whatever.

551
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,700
And then I started laughing about it.

552
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,279
Hold on, I need to see it.

553
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,079
Well, people were like,

554
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:17,920
what do you mean?

555
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,740
What am I talking about?

556
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,769
It's so clear what I was pointing at.

557
00:26:20,769 --> 00:26:21,609
Soy Andy.

558
00:26:21,609 --> 00:26:24,109
Let me see if I did it on purpose.

559
00:26:24,109 --> 00:26:24,950
Laundry.

560
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:30,039
What are you?

561
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:31,799
Those.

562
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:32,640
Yeah, okay.

563
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,460
No, I'm doing the thing.

564
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,299
I'm doing.

565
00:26:34,299 --> 00:26:35,599
Okay, at about, so of this clip right here.

566
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:36,940
Those.

567
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:40,779
At exactly eight seconds when my mouth opens

568
00:26:40,779 --> 00:26:43,880
and I say those is when I realized

569
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,460
that this is what I was doing.

570
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,359
So I just held it.

571
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:47,259
I freeze.

572
00:26:47,259 --> 00:26:48,099
I froze.

573
00:26:48,099 --> 00:26:48,920
No, I'm doing.

574
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,960
And that's when it was, you know,

575
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,390
it could have been on purpose at that point.

576
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:55,210
It was not on purpose until about seven

577
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:58,960
and a half seconds in that clip.

578
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,500
I can't play the game before people scream

579
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:06,579
at me for being the worst streamer on Twitch again.

580
00:27:06,579 --> 00:27:10,619
Okay.

581
00:27:10,619 --> 00:27:11,640
Why do you hate Europeans?

582
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:20,369
I live in the fucking America.

583
00:27:20,369 --> 00:27:21,710
I live in the United States of America

584
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:24,650
on the western most coast of the country.

585
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:27,420
You and I, when you're eating breakfast, dude,

586
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,380
I'm just going to bed.

587
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,980
I'm like getting under the covers

588
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,380
and like going to sleep when you wake up

589
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,720
and you eat breakfast.

590
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,519
When you go to bed, I'm like, oh, waking up.

591
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:38,460
It's like fucking 11 o'clock in the morning.

592
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:41,740
I live across the world from you.

593
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:45,799
I live in the United States of America.

594
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:49,660
He hates Europeans.

595
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,480
All right.

596
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,720
I need to leave.

597
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,720
It's 3 a.m. right now.

598
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,859
Dude, it's four o'clock in the afternoon here

599
00:27:58,859 --> 00:28:00,920
and I'm at peak happiness.

600
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:04,710
So I'm sorry.

601
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:06,109
Okay.

602
00:28:06,109 --> 00:28:08,640
Let's go.

603
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,480
I can't leave.

604
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,319
I need to gather my dirty clothes.

605
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:11,140
All right.

606
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:16,509
Let's get the dirty clothes.

607
00:28:16,509 --> 00:28:26,369
Pizza, chair, small black and white TV, okay.

608
00:28:26,369 --> 00:28:27,190
All right.

609
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:30,299
How much dirty clothes do I have?

610
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:35,099
Dirty clothes and Coke 24 packs.

611
00:28:35,099 --> 00:28:37,829
Did I get it all?

612
00:28:37,829 --> 00:28:38,670
Okay.

613
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:39,940
I think I got it all.

614
00:28:41,849 --> 00:28:45,970
What do you mean all my dirty clothes?

615
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:47,089
Is that it?

616
00:28:47,089 --> 00:28:47,930
There we go.

617
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:48,829
I think that's all the dirty laundry.

618
00:28:48,829 --> 00:28:52,579
Time to go to the basement.

619
00:28:52,579 --> 00:28:57,630
You didn't deny that you hate EU.

620
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:58,670
What do you mean I hate EU?

621
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:03,880
No, I'm saying I don't hate EU.

622
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,210
I just said it.

623
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,869
I said I don't hate EU.

624
00:29:06,869 --> 00:29:07,710
Why are you making that up?

625
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:11,819
What are you trying to make me look bad?

626
00:29:11,819 --> 00:29:15,890
I'm sorry that our clocks are different right now.

627
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:18,660
Where's the basement?

628
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:27,359
Oh, okay.

629
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:28,930
Wait, what?

630
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:29,970
Jerma, keep me entertained

631
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:32,009
while my bowels are being cleansed.

632
00:29:32,009 --> 00:29:41,130
That's from the Dusk Dev.

633
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:43,539
I'm gonna try.

634
00:29:43,539 --> 00:29:44,380
A nice man lives here.

635
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,200
It's good to know you have

636
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:52,380
at least one good neighbor.

637
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,589
Newspaper.

638
00:29:53,589 --> 00:29:54,990
Headline reads,

639
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:57,640
womb ripper strikes again.

640
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,900
In the early hours of the 30th,

641
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,799
authorities were called when a passerby

642
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,859
found a terribly mangled corpse,

643
00:30:02,859 --> 00:30:06,279
haphazardly tossed on the nearby grounds.

644
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:08,960
Sources indicate that the woman was indeed pregnant.

645
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,160
And just like previous victims,

646
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,759
the fetus was cut out and assumed

647
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:14,079
to be taken by the assailant.

648
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:15,940
This is now the fourth victim in as many weeks,

649
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,619
and authorities are struggling to come up with leads

650
00:30:17,619 --> 00:30:20,079
and one of the most gruesome crime sprees

651
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:25,880
the city has ever endured.

652
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,880
The woman and her son live here.

653
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,720
Now that I think about it,

654
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:37,920
I haven't seen either one in about a week.

655
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,599
Okay.

656
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:42,259
Oh, also, you know what's different about this audio setup

657
00:30:42,259 --> 00:30:45,250
that a bunch of people are gonna be really pissed off about?

658
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:47,339
But I'll try to fix it eventually.

659
00:30:47,339 --> 00:30:49,019
I make a ton of mouth sounds.

660
00:30:49,019 --> 00:30:55,000
And now, now you can hear them all.

661
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:02,859
See, before you couldn't hear any of those.

662
00:31:02,859 --> 00:31:03,700
See?

663
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,789
I hate that.

664
00:31:05,789 --> 00:31:07,569
Okay.

665
00:31:07,569 --> 00:31:08,410
I don't need to go to that floor

666
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:13,579
besides one of the people in that floor has a mean dog.

667
00:31:13,579 --> 00:31:16,339
All right, we'll make sure we get over this really quick.

668
00:31:16,339 --> 00:31:17,500
Let's get over this really quick

669
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,880
because I know that we're gonna see a lot of these.

670
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,829
So let's just get over this for the next minute or so.

671
00:31:21,829 --> 00:31:23,700
Let's just get over this.

672
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,539
Hold on.

673
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:30,640
Let me just get over this real quick.

674
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:36,319
Let me just get over this.

675
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:37,920
Okay.

676
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,519
This is, we're gonna get over this.

677
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:45,329
Just bear with me while we go through these.

678
00:31:45,329 --> 00:31:47,319
Very nice.

679
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:48,160
Yes.

680
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:52,759
Absolutely.

681
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:56,819
I think that's BB-8 or whatever that character's name is.

682
00:31:56,819 --> 00:31:59,480
Okay.

683
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,319
Let's keep them coming.

684
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:05,450
We're gonna blow through these.

685
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:07,940
Uh-huh.

686
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,529
Very nice.

687
00:32:09,529 --> 00:32:10,529
It's a pretty good website.

688
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:13,869
If you're looking for news or...

689
00:32:13,869 --> 00:32:22,049
How did you, what?

690
00:32:22,049 --> 00:32:25,970
That one's kind of big.

691
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:31,529
Uh-huh.

692
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:34,960
But why are these so, like, who cares?

693
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:40,839
This is like...

694
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:43,299
Yeah, I'm sorry, but Las Vegas is fucking cool.

695
00:32:43,299 --> 00:32:44,140
Okay?

696
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:44,960
I'm sorry.

697
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,799
Me pointing at the Las Vegas sign

698
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,640
is not me pointing at the Reddit sign

699
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,039
because Vegas is fucking cool.

700
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:51,279
I love this place.

701
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:57,400
So, excuse me?

702
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:05,680
Somebody made the template, but it's not even...

703
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,519
Here's the template.

704
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:23,210
Should I leave this on the stream?

705
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:31,500
So stupid.

706
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:35,740
Oh, this is so annoying.

707
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:36,980
Wait, I've already done this?

708
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:37,819
What do you mean?

709
00:33:37,819 --> 00:33:41,440
Hold on.

710
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,279
A classic.

711
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:46,329
I did already do this?

712
00:33:47,009 --> 00:33:52,250
This is from years ago.

713
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:55,319
This is the hot air balloon.

714
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:57,839
I didn't actually do this, did I?

715
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:00,559
I fucking did.

716
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:05,299
This is before anybody even gave a shit about this.

717
00:34:05,299 --> 00:34:07,809
This actually was from, like, four years ago

718
00:34:07,809 --> 00:34:11,429
before that meme, anyone even cared.

719
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:14,219
Oh my God, I look like shit.

720
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:15,059
I look tired.

721
00:34:15,059 --> 00:34:16,800
What's wrong with my eyes?

722
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,389
Why do I look so fucking disheveled?

723
00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:23,599
Okay.

724
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:24,639
This one, we'll just put this one up

725
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,480
and then I'm gonna move on.

726
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,480
I'm gonna play the horror game

727
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,679
that I'm supposed to be playing.

728
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,000
You know, why not show this one too?

729
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,380
This is gonna be a favorite, I think.

730
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:40,920
You look like a newly discovered fish.

731
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:50,929
All right, dude.

732
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:52,780
That was fun.

733
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:55,780
Let's play the video game.

734
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:58,969
Do I have audio?

735
00:34:58,969 --> 00:35:00,289
All right.

736
00:35:00,289 --> 00:35:06,239
You look like a taxidermy fish.

737
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:11,670
What do you look like at eight o'clock in the morning?

738
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:12,510
Oh, that's loud.

739
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,329
That's very loud.

740
00:35:13,329 --> 00:35:14,659
It hurts.

741
00:35:14,659 --> 00:35:20,079
I get a...

742
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,199
All right, this is the last one I'm gonna show.

743
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:43,840
I promise.

744
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:54,079
Nice zit.

745
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:55,159
An old tire.

746
00:35:55,159 --> 00:35:56,960
Actually, I don't like the CRT filter.

747
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:04,710
It kind of makes me wanna throw up.

748
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:08,019
Out of order?

749
00:36:08,019 --> 00:36:08,840
Turn it off.

750
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:24,059
Yeah, it kind of makes me wanna puke.

751
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:28,659
It's worse.

752
00:36:28,659 --> 00:36:33,769
It smells like it hasn't been taken out in months.

753
00:36:33,809 --> 00:36:34,789
Out of order?

754
00:36:34,789 --> 00:36:35,809
What am I gonna do now?

755
00:36:35,809 --> 00:36:38,159
I should probably go back upstairs and figure something out.

756
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:41,610
Turn the headbomb off.

757
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:53,190
I think I heard something coming from the closet.

758
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,570
I think I need to keep it on.

759
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:56,480
I think it's designed to have it on.

760
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,030
It looks weird now.

761
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:03,829
Yeah, it somehow looks worse the other way.

762
00:37:03,829 --> 00:37:12,880
What do you mean from the closet?

763
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:20,909
Oh, that hurts.

764
00:37:20,909 --> 00:37:27,579
I don't need to go through there.

765
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:28,420
Loud, by the way.

766
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,260
It's probably gonna be loud.

767
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:33,639
Somebody's probably gonna jump in front of the screen.

768
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:34,920
Go back.

769
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,900
You ignored this jump scare.

770
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:40,920
What?

771
00:37:40,920 --> 00:38:01,400
What are you talking about?

772
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:05,480
Let's see what's inside.

773
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,489
This one's empty.

774
00:38:07,489 --> 00:38:13,929
Filled with porno.

775
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:14,849
What are you talking about?

776
00:38:14,849 --> 00:38:17,469
The closet?

777
00:38:17,469 --> 00:38:19,820
What closet?

778
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:46,239
This is a filing cabinet.

779
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:47,159
That's a tuba reaction.

780
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:49,760
I kinda feel like a cartoon.

781
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,719
It was a tuba reaction.

782
00:38:50,719 --> 00:39:01,969
I did not expect, whatever.

783
00:39:01,969 --> 00:39:04,460
Damn girl, you scared the big Jesus out of me.

784
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:07,019
God damn girl, you scared the big Jesus out of me.

785
00:39:07,019 --> 00:39:07,860
I scared you?

786
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:12,829
You scared me.

787
00:39:12,829 --> 00:39:16,000
Goku.

788
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,380
I'm sorry for scaring you.

789
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:19,739
I'll tell you, but can you keep this to yourself?

790
00:39:19,739 --> 00:39:20,800
I love this acting.

791
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,739
I love this actor.

792
00:39:21,739 --> 00:39:22,579
This is great.

793
00:39:22,579 --> 00:39:23,599
This is actually, I love this.

794
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:26,800
Jesus Christ, Joe, you're insane.

795
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,840
Yeah, I can.

796
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,079
What's up?

797
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,800
The missus kicked me out and it's too cold outside,

798
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,239
so I'm trying to wait her out down here.

799
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:35,880
I really didn't mean to creep argue.

800
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:42,519
Honest.

801
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:44,750
This is never gonna end, is it?

802
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:46,190
This is never gonna end.

803
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,030
This is what happens.

804
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:47,869
I just can't stop.

805
00:39:47,869 --> 00:39:55,889
I cannot stop this.

806
00:39:55,889 --> 00:39:58,010
But I need to show them, right?

807
00:39:58,010 --> 00:40:04,739
It's my obligation to.

808
00:40:04,739 --> 00:40:05,579
I believe you.

809
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:07,699
Just next time, maybe don't go around

810
00:40:07,699 --> 00:40:11,039
slinging doors open and hiding in the dark.

811
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:11,920
I will.

812
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,079
Thanks, kid.

813
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:15,360
Say, if you're wanting to use the washing machine,

814
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,760
it's broken.

815
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,800
Yeah, thanks.

816
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:20,690
I figured that out.

817
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:25,300
Okay, thanks a lot.

818
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,460
I thought you guys were full of shit

819
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,980
that I missed the jump scare.

820
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:30,219
I thought, like, go check the closet.

821
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:32,340
I thought it was this.

822
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:39,000
I did not know the door was gonna rip open.

823
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:39,920
That was very scary.

824
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,760
It was probably loud.

825
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,760
Just, it's gonna be loud.

826
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,019
Just, please be aware of that.

827
00:40:45,019 --> 00:40:46,139
They're gonna hear it.

828
00:40:50,809 --> 00:40:52,170
Oh, fuck, I don't have a noise gate anymore.

829
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:56,889
You definitely heard that, without a doubt.

830
00:40:56,889 --> 00:41:00,210
Oh, well.

831
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:01,289
Fuck.

832
00:41:01,289 --> 00:41:06,880
This is why I can't, wait, forget what I just did.

833
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,650
What's up, sir?

834
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:11,849
Oh, you know, trying to balance life, school, and job hunting.

835
00:41:11,849 --> 00:41:14,090
It's a tough world these days.

836
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:15,690
Liam been treating you well.

837
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:19,699
When he isn't drunk, yeah.

838
00:41:19,699 --> 00:41:22,929
You'll tell me if it gets bad, yeah?

839
00:41:22,929 --> 00:41:23,849
This is my neighbor.

840
00:41:23,849 --> 00:41:26,139
I know it ain't easy to talk about.

841
00:41:26,139 --> 00:41:28,170
And you don't have to tell me nothing.

842
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:31,010
Just promise me you'll tell me if you need help.

843
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:33,369
My sister used to be in a bad situation, too.

844
00:41:33,369 --> 00:41:34,929
And there's places you can go.

845
00:41:34,929 --> 00:41:36,650
I appreciate that, Stan.

846
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:37,690
I really do.

847
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:38,929
Yeah, sure.

848
00:41:38,929 --> 00:41:41,170
You doing some laundry at this time of night?

849
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:42,900
I'm trying to.

850
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,099
Of course, when I really need it,

851
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:46,260
the washer downstairs is broken.

852
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,900
Ain't that some shit?

853
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,039
Yeah.

854
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:51,159
And speaking of shit, I have an interview tomorrow,

855
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:54,369
so I guess I'll show up smelling like crap.

856
00:41:54,369 --> 00:41:55,210
Jesus.

857
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:56,289
Well, if it's an emergency,

858
00:41:56,289 --> 00:41:59,130
I heard of this laundromat that's open 24-7,

859
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:00,409
just outside of town.

860
00:42:00,409 --> 00:42:02,760
Still early enough to catch the last bus.

861
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,760
24-7, outside of town.

862
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,599
I'll have to say, though,

863
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:09,199
it's a hell of a time to be out so late,

864
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:13,929
especially with that maniac roaming around.

865
00:42:13,969 --> 00:42:17,079
I mean, if I needed to do laundry and I couldn't,

866
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:19,400
I'd probably just turn the sink on

867
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,000
and just put a bunch of soap in the sink

868
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,280
and plug the hole so the sink will fill up

869
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,119
and just like...

870
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:27,760
Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug.

871
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,869
And then just kind of hang it over the shower curtain

872
00:42:31,869 --> 00:42:35,360
and just let it dry.

873
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,260
I'm a big girl, Stan.

874
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,599
Do you know the address?

875
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:40,719
Sure, sure.

876
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:41,960
Let me write it down for you.

877
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,800
1800s laundry?

878
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,760
Promise me you'll take care, all right?

879
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,789
I mean, if you just need one, you know,

880
00:42:47,789 --> 00:42:50,710
a shirt, a pair of pants,

881
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:51,829
maybe another shirt or something.

882
00:42:51,829 --> 00:42:52,750
Yeah, I would just do it in the,

883
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:54,030
I would just turn the shower on and just,

884
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,429
I would just put the clothes on

885
00:42:55,429 --> 00:42:56,269
and just get in the shower

886
00:42:56,269 --> 00:42:58,610
and take a shower with the clothes on

887
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:11,360
and then just take them off and just air dry them.

888
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,989
That's how, why is that weird?

889
00:43:13,989 --> 00:43:17,190
Is that really that weird to like wash your clothes

890
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:19,190
if you're in like an emergency situation

891
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:21,389
where your laundry machine doesn't work

892
00:43:21,389 --> 00:43:26,650
or to just wash your fucking clothes in the sink?

893
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:31,539
Why is that such a weird take?

894
00:43:31,539 --> 00:43:33,280
It's warm water and soap.

895
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,230
What do you think happens in the washing machine?

896
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:37,769
Do you think there's like a magical elf

897
00:43:37,889 --> 00:43:39,090
that when you turn the washing machine on

898
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:43,139
that takes your clothes to someplace to clean them,

899
00:43:43,139 --> 00:43:45,139
it's just soap and water and it just goes.

900
00:43:45,139 --> 00:43:56,389
doesn't do anything else while wearing them?

901
00:43:56,389 --> 00:43:59,670
Well, you could like probably save water.

902
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:11,150
You take a shower and clean the clothes at the same time.

903
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:12,349
So now I just gotta get ready

904
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:19,380
to go to the laundromat, I think, right?

905
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:29,730
I thought it was a clock, thought it was a health pack.

906
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:31,170
All right, I'm ready to go.

907
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:38,119
I got my clothes, I'm ready to move out.

908
00:44:38,119 --> 00:44:40,039
Hurry, you might be able to catch the next bus.

909
00:44:40,039 --> 00:44:53,610
Thanks again, Stan.

910
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:54,449
Do I have to go all the way down

911
00:44:54,449 --> 00:44:55,780
or just out this front door?

912
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:57,119
I'm on the second floor right now, okay.

913
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:59,670
Second floor.

914
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:01,559
I need to get my purse first.

915
00:45:01,559 --> 00:45:10,769
What?

916
00:45:10,769 --> 00:45:13,269
Dan's the murderer.

917
00:45:13,269 --> 00:45:14,110
Don't you dare.

918
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:19,070
It just, okay, if that's a spoiler, you're in deep shit.

919
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:23,710
You're in deep shit.

920
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:26,090
That person's in deep shit.

921
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:33,869
All right, where's my purse?

922
00:45:33,869 --> 00:45:35,369
Where's my purse?

923
00:45:35,369 --> 00:45:36,840
Oh, there it is.

924
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,239
You can backseat me.

925
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:39,360
You can call me an idiot.

926
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,519
You can call me stupid.

927
00:45:40,519 --> 00:45:42,760
But the second that you put what happens

928
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:45,960
at the end of end game in the chat here,

929
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:49,289
I don't think so.

930
00:45:49,289 --> 00:45:55,360
All right, let's do it.

931
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,449
Goodbye.

932
00:45:57,449 --> 00:46:01,800
I gotta, this image is just on my other monitor.

933
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,619
I'm gonna add this as Jerma Chest to BTTV.

934
00:46:05,619 --> 00:46:08,099
Whatever, that's fine.

935
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:13,849
That's fine.

936
00:46:13,849 --> 00:46:18,769
That's fine.

937
00:46:18,769 --> 00:46:20,789
Ugh.

938
00:46:20,789 --> 00:46:23,289
All right, can I turn the audio down?

939
00:46:23,289 --> 00:46:24,489
Is it really gonna be that loud?

940
00:46:24,489 --> 00:46:26,159
Like, I don't like that.

941
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:27,519
I don't like this.

942
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:29,139
I don't like how loud the sounds are.

943
00:46:29,139 --> 00:46:33,969
There's a person right here.

944
00:46:33,969 --> 00:46:35,429
Hi there.

945
00:46:35,429 --> 00:46:36,510
Are you okay?

946
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:38,289
Can I get you anything?

947
00:46:38,289 --> 00:46:40,000
It's gone.

948
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,889
They took it.

949
00:46:41,889 --> 00:46:44,900
Did someone steal something from you?

950
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:45,739
They took it.

951
00:46:45,739 --> 00:46:49,460
The people in the walls, they took it from me.

952
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:52,280
Oh God, she's here now.

953
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:54,119
I should probably leave him alone.

954
00:46:54,119 --> 00:47:00,599
Poor guy.

955
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:08,210
Jesus.

956
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:31,099
Bus stop.

957
00:47:31,099 --> 00:47:31,940
What?

958
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:37,670
What are you doing?

959
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:38,489
Run?

960
00:47:38,489 --> 00:47:39,329
Is that the bus?

961
00:47:39,329 --> 00:47:44,760
That's not the bus?

962
00:47:44,760 --> 00:48:00,800
That'd be a really weird bus.

963
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,329
Got any change?

964
00:48:02,329 --> 00:48:04,929
Sure, I have a couple dollars.

965
00:48:04,929 --> 00:48:06,010
Better than nothing.

966
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:07,130
Thanks, kid.

967
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:09,389
Haven't seen you around here before.

968
00:48:09,389 --> 00:48:11,369
I moved in not too long ago.

969
00:48:11,369 --> 00:48:12,889
I'm usually studying or at my classes.

970
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:13,730
It's your Uber.

971
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:15,010
So that's probably why.

972
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:16,920
What was that?

973
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,309
Oh, a college girl, huh?

974
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:21,840
What are you studying?

975
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,780
I'm pursuing a career in education at the moment.

976
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:27,980
Nice, that's what I got my bachelor's in.

977
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:31,559
Oh, that's great.

978
00:48:31,559 --> 00:48:34,079
I hope I can find a gig soon afterwards.

979
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:40,849
If not, my sleeping bag has room for two.

980
00:48:40,849 --> 00:48:43,900
Anything in the dumpster?

981
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:49,710
Oh, there's the bus.

982
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:54,949
How do I get on?

983
00:48:54,949 --> 00:48:57,230
Where are you heading at this hour?

984
00:48:57,230 --> 00:48:59,809
If you don't mind me asking.

985
00:48:59,809 --> 00:49:06,380
The laundromat on the outside of town.

986
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:08,260
Not sure I believe that.

987
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:10,679
Pretty late to be doing laundry.

988
00:49:10,679 --> 00:49:12,519
Hey, if you're looking to score,

989
00:49:12,519 --> 00:49:16,440
I have a good deal just for a pretty little thing like you.

990
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,880
Oh, fucking leave me alone.

991
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:19,719
You won't even have to pay cash if you know what I mean.

992
00:49:19,719 --> 00:49:21,159
How about you just drive the bus

993
00:49:21,159 --> 00:49:23,159
and I'll pretend you're not a desperate loser.

994
00:49:23,159 --> 00:49:25,059
Whatever, bitch.

995
00:49:25,059 --> 00:49:27,400
Sit the fuck down so I can get this piece

996
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:31,130
of junk rolling again.

997
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:32,909
What the fuck?

998
00:49:32,909 --> 00:49:35,150
Dirty seat, dirty seat, dirty seat,

999
00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:36,690
dirty seat, dirty seat.

1000
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:48,250
Well, I guess I'm gonna sit here.

1001
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:49,429
It's gonna be fucking loud.

1002
00:49:49,429 --> 00:49:59,769
Should I turn it down?

1003
00:49:59,769 --> 00:50:20,150
Turn it down.

1004
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:27,889
Turn it up.

1005
00:50:27,889 --> 00:50:28,889
I was gonna say, excuse me,

1006
00:50:28,889 --> 00:50:30,579
when does the bus leave?

1007
00:50:30,579 --> 00:50:32,139
There was a, I looked online

1008
00:50:32,139 --> 00:50:43,760
and said the schedule was at 12.15 and it's 12.18.

1009
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:51,480
Turn the FOV down.

1010
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:52,639
What are you doing?

1011
00:50:52,639 --> 00:50:56,380
Sit down in a seat.

1012
00:50:56,380 --> 00:51:05,530
Why are you still, okay, that's fucking.

1013
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:10,179
Sit down in a seat.

1014
00:51:10,179 --> 00:51:12,380
All right, dude, like seriously, sit down.

1015
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:14,219
This is, no fucking way.

1016
00:51:14,219 --> 00:51:15,219
This is no way.

1017
00:51:15,219 --> 00:51:18,559
This guy right now would be going like this,

1018
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:21,159
flanning his right foot and stuffing it on the ground

1019
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:27,130
desperately trying to not fall down.

1020
00:51:27,130 --> 00:51:28,610
You don't have to do that, by the way.

1021
00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:31,010
I know that when some of you guys get on the train

1022
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:32,690
or on the bus or whatever,

1023
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:40,940
or whatever, you just grab onto it.

1024
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:42,800
Dude, I fucking hate this guy.

1025
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:50,989
He's just weird and he's right next to me.

1026
00:51:50,989 --> 00:51:53,429
How many of you guys have done that shuffle

1027
00:51:53,429 --> 00:51:54,929
where you just plant your foot

1028
00:51:54,929 --> 00:51:56,849
and you don't want to grab onto anything

1029
00:51:56,849 --> 00:51:57,769
because it's like, well, I know,

1030
00:51:57,769 --> 00:52:00,130
I can't grab onto the pole.

1031
00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:01,880
I can handle it.

1032
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:04,159
Then you go, ooh.

1033
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:06,880
And then everybody looks at you

1034
00:52:07,699 --> 00:52:08,980
and they're like, fucking idiot.

1035
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:14,980
Should have just held onto the pole.

1036
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:20,619
All right, I don't want.

1037
00:52:20,619 --> 00:52:28,079
This person's freaking me out.

1038
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:29,420
I did that as a kid.

1039
00:52:31,519 --> 00:52:34,199
Look out the window.

1040
00:52:34,199 --> 00:52:38,130
It's so dark, I can't even see the street.

1041
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:40,210
I knew he was going to do that.

1042
00:52:40,210 --> 00:52:41,289
I was ready for it.

1043
00:52:41,289 --> 00:52:43,590
I was like, oh dude, look out the window, okay.

1044
00:52:47,550 --> 00:52:49,070
I fucking knew that was going to happen.

1045
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:49,889
I knew it.

1046
00:52:49,889 --> 00:52:52,230
I was waiting for it for the whole time he was on the bus.

1047
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:56,219
May I sit beside you?

1048
00:52:56,219 --> 00:52:57,420
There's plenty of other seats,

1049
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:02,650
so I don't see why you would need to do that.

1050
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:08,289
May I, may I sit beside you?

1051
00:53:08,289 --> 00:53:10,929
Are you deaf?

1052
00:53:10,929 --> 00:53:13,690
Do I need to get the driver to throw you off?

1053
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:19,670
You're going to die tonight.

1054
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:21,000
What?

1055
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,679
You're going to die tonight.

1056
00:53:23,679 --> 00:53:25,239
I've seen it.

1057
00:53:25,239 --> 00:53:28,559
Tonight is your last night on earth.

1058
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:31,800
You are walking straight into your doom.

1059
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,780
Can't you see that?

1060
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:36,280
You and that child inside you.

1061
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,099
How did you?

1062
00:53:40,099 --> 00:53:45,099
You will be found just like all the others.

1063
00:53:45,579 --> 00:53:48,340
Ripped open, your insides displayed

1064
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:51,940
for all the angels above to look down and see.

1065
00:53:53,039 --> 00:53:57,179
Oh yes, of that I am certain.

1066
00:53:57,179 --> 00:53:59,260
Please just stop talking.

1067
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:01,780
May I sit beside you?

1068
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:06,909
All right miss, this is your stop.

1069
00:54:06,909 --> 00:54:11,110
I mean, so where you put the fucking,

1070
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:13,050
just fucking grab him by the neck.

1071
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:13,889
Just grab him.

1072
00:54:13,889 --> 00:54:16,090
Just fucking go bang into the back of the over here

1073
00:54:16,090 --> 00:54:17,809
and be like, what are you threatening me?

1074
00:54:17,809 --> 00:54:25,920
What's how we tell what's happening here?

1075
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:38,159
Get his ass.

1076
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:40,539
Yeah, you mean it's something like, I don't know, man.

1077
00:54:40,539 --> 00:54:45,159
I'm just like, you kind of be like, oh, what's,

1078
00:54:45,159 --> 00:54:46,000
let's go.

1079
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:46,820
You know what I mean?

1080
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:50,980
Like go.

1081
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:51,820
Like, what's that?

1082
00:54:51,820 --> 00:55:03,920
There's lights or something, grab.

1083
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,099
No noise gate, so loud.

1084
00:55:06,099 --> 00:55:19,059
I told you.

1085
00:55:19,059 --> 00:55:26,079
It's not that bad.

1086
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:39,639
That guy was fucking scary.

1087
00:55:39,659 --> 00:55:42,619
I'm scared, please turn it off.

1088
00:55:42,619 --> 00:55:47,280
This is what we're here for.

1089
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,840
Good job, you completed the tutorial in one hour.

1090
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:53,329
No, don't be a liar.

1091
00:55:53,329 --> 00:55:54,750
Don't be a liar.

1092
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:56,719
That's what you're doing, you're lying.

1093
00:55:56,719 --> 00:55:58,119
The first 30 minutes of the stream

1094
00:55:58,119 --> 00:55:59,679
was me talking about announcements,

1095
00:55:59,679 --> 00:56:02,239
talking about some changes that I'm gonna be making.

1096
00:56:02,239 --> 00:56:03,719
We sat there for about 30 minutes.

1097
00:56:03,719 --> 00:56:05,880
Then I did the soy face thing.

1098
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:07,360
That was about 15 minutes.

1099
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,159
So no, that's you being a liar

1100
00:56:09,159 --> 00:56:11,880
and I don't appreciate that very much.

1101
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:15,119
It's been about 15 to 16 minutes

1102
00:56:15,139 --> 00:56:39,820
of actual in-game video game time.

1103
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:50,179
Laundromat.

1104
00:56:50,179 --> 00:56:51,860
Yes, what is it?

1105
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:56,349
Oh, are you all really open all night?

1106
00:56:56,349 --> 00:56:59,159
We're open all night, but I take my naps at midnight.

1107
00:56:59,159 --> 00:57:01,800
So you better not need anything after that.

1108
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,480
Oh, okay.

1109
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:05,880
I'll be sure not to need anything.

1110
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:09,829
Yeah, we'll see.

1111
00:57:09,829 --> 00:57:11,550
Need a game toy here?

1112
00:57:11,550 --> 00:57:15,369
Press tab to equip and un-equip your inventory.

1113
00:57:15,369 --> 00:57:16,449
I'll bring it back before I leave.

1114
00:57:16,449 --> 00:57:20,139
It'll be a long night, so I might need it.

1115
00:57:20,139 --> 00:57:21,960
Game toy, can I play it?

1116
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:22,800
Whoa, okay.

1117
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:25,639
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right.

1118
00:57:25,639 --> 00:57:26,920
Fork sees revenge.

1119
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:32,340
Left mouse button to start the game.

1120
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:37,239
What do I do?

1121
00:57:37,239 --> 00:57:38,880
How do I, what do I do?

1122
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:42,699
How do I control the game?

1123
00:57:42,699 --> 00:57:50,280
What the fuck, did I just kill somebody?

1124
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:56,260
Am I doing this right?

1125
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:58,820
Am I doing this right?

1126
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:06,440
Should I not be doing that?

1127
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:07,400
Should I not be doing that?

1128
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:08,559
All right, what if I avoid?

1129
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:10,099
I can't, I have to.

1130
00:58:10,099 --> 00:58:18,909
Score one.

1131
00:58:18,909 --> 00:58:25,730
Okay, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it.

1132
00:58:25,730 --> 00:58:28,920
How do I win?

1133
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:40,150
All right, I gotta pay attention to the screen.

1134
00:58:41,010 --> 00:58:51,119
What do I need to win?

1135
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:52,840
The song is really good.

1136
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:57,139
Yeah, it's a pretty good song.

1137
00:58:57,139 --> 00:58:58,539
Oh, I'm done.

1138
00:58:58,539 --> 00:58:59,380
That's stupid.

1139
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:04,110
All right, do I actually have to do this?

1140
00:59:04,110 --> 00:59:15,329
You have to get to 100.

1141
00:59:15,329 --> 00:59:16,630
Okay, get that out of here.

1142
00:59:16,630 --> 00:59:18,969
All right, so I'm just gonna do my laundry.

1143
00:59:18,969 --> 00:59:20,289
Which one should I use?

1144
00:59:20,289 --> 00:59:21,800
Those are dryers.

1145
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,530
Soap dispenser.

1146
00:59:23,530 --> 00:59:27,599
Brought my own soap.

1147
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:31,349
Laundry cot.

1148
00:59:31,349 --> 00:59:36,139
Coffee.

1149
00:59:36,139 --> 00:59:36,980
A patron.

1150
00:59:42,179 --> 00:59:44,039
Laundry down the road.

1151
00:59:44,039 --> 00:59:47,239
This place is the only one open when I get off work.

1152
00:59:47,239 --> 00:59:50,599
Was a real pain when the first one burnt down.

1153
00:59:50,599 --> 00:59:52,400
First one?

1154
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,000
You knew around here?

1155
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,679
Yeah, this place used to be next door years ago.

1156
00:59:57,679 --> 00:59:59,960
But there was a big fire.

1157
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:03,159
I don't think they ever found out exactly what caused it.

1158
01:00:03,159 --> 01:00:04,440
That sounds awful.

1159
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:08,769
Girl died in that fire too.

1160
01:00:08,769 --> 01:00:10,409
An employee.

1161
01:00:10,409 --> 01:00:13,369
I don't like to spread rumors, but.

1162
01:00:14,230 --> 01:00:16,630
Pretty mysterious.

1163
01:00:16,630 --> 01:00:18,630
The way she died, I mean.

1164
01:00:18,630 --> 01:00:21,150
It wasn't a fire that started quickly.

1165
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:23,989
She should have had plenty of time to get out.

1166
01:00:23,989 --> 01:00:26,190
But she was found in the office.

1167
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:29,340
It was me that died in the fire.

1168
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:32,400
This is like a whole weird Silent Hill type thing

1169
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:36,219
where it's me that died in the fire.

1170
01:00:36,219 --> 01:00:38,019
I heard they were close to opening up

1171
01:00:38,019 --> 01:00:39,539
a murder investigation.

1172
01:00:39,539 --> 01:00:40,380
Right.

1173
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:44,159
That a detective thought the girl was locked in.

1174
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:45,000
Could be.

1175
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,539
She decided to drop it when nobody came up.

1176
01:00:48,539 --> 01:00:49,940
You know, cops.

1177
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:52,880
Lazy sons of bitches.

1178
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:55,699
As a fellow writer, you know, you can,

1179
01:00:55,699 --> 01:00:58,099
as a fellow writer, when you start to see

1180
01:00:58,099 --> 01:01:01,239
the pieces come together in the intro

1181
01:01:01,239 --> 01:01:03,079
or what could be the outro,

1182
01:01:03,079 --> 01:01:05,800
I can kind of see it from a pretty long way away.

1183
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:07,079
As a fellow writer, of course.

1184
01:01:07,079 --> 01:01:14,420
Well, if that's true, it does sound pretty suspect.

1185
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:16,300
Sure does.

1186
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:19,420
Feels like it got swept under the rug pretty quick.

1187
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:21,119
What with the womb ripper coming around

1188
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:23,429
and butchering those women.

1189
01:01:23,429 --> 01:01:29,360
That has all the headlines these days.

1190
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:30,599
Okay.

1191
01:01:30,599 --> 01:01:33,829
So, all right.

1192
01:01:33,829 --> 01:01:36,440
So let me just do my laundry.

1193
01:01:36,440 --> 01:02:10,929
Pick up urban legends one.

1194
01:02:10,929 --> 01:02:11,769
All right.

1195
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:12,590
That was pretty good.

1196
01:02:12,590 --> 01:02:15,090
What happened though?

1197
01:02:15,090 --> 01:02:22,349
I couldn't really tell.

1198
01:02:22,349 --> 01:02:23,710
Yes, what is it?

1199
01:02:23,710 --> 01:02:25,150
Oh, um.

1200
01:02:25,150 --> 01:02:25,989
We're up on.

1201
01:02:25,989 --> 01:02:26,829
Oh yeah.

1202
01:02:26,829 --> 01:02:31,559
So how do I do laundry?

1203
01:02:31,559 --> 01:02:34,159
Dryers, washers.

1204
01:02:34,159 --> 01:02:35,000
Okay.

1205
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,829
Where do I, how do I use one?

1206
01:02:36,829 --> 01:02:42,210
Washers, washers, washers.

1207
01:02:42,269 --> 01:02:43,110
Oh, okay.

1208
01:02:43,110 --> 01:02:44,260
This one's up.

1209
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:54,659
I need to get some change first.

1210
01:02:54,659 --> 01:02:55,500
Where's the change?

1211
01:02:55,500 --> 01:03:01,619
Change machine?

1212
01:03:01,619 --> 01:03:03,519
What do I make change?

1213
01:03:03,519 --> 01:03:04,360
What do I make change?

1214
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:05,199
Yes, what is.

1215
01:03:05,199 --> 01:03:06,039
Oh, um.

1216
01:03:06,039 --> 01:03:06,880
We're up.

1217
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:07,719
Oh yeah.

1218
01:03:07,719 --> 01:03:13,000
Where do I make change?

1219
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:17,250
The vending machine?

1220
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:19,570
Isn't there usually a thing to do it with?

1221
01:03:19,570 --> 01:03:22,670
Where is it?

1222
01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:23,510
Magazines.

1223
01:03:23,510 --> 01:03:28,019
Where's the change machine?

1224
01:03:28,019 --> 01:03:32,980
You put the dollar in and you get the arcade tokens.

1225
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:36,090
You need to look in your purse.

1226
01:03:36,090 --> 01:03:40,320
Explore, you stooge.

1227
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:41,780
I still fucking so pissed off

1228
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:44,619
that they're not in Fortnite.

1229
01:03:44,619 --> 01:03:45,460
Yeah.

1230
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:48,639
The other day they added to Fortnite in the last two weeks.

1231
01:03:48,639 --> 01:03:50,920
And you tell me that the three stooges

1232
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:52,320
could not have been a possibility.

1233
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:54,829
Please.

1234
01:03:54,829 --> 01:03:56,710
In fact, it's gonna, it's going to fucking happen.

1235
01:03:56,710 --> 01:03:58,230
It will happen.

1236
01:03:58,230 --> 01:04:05,340
It's just not gonna happen on our timetable.

1237
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:17,139
Aren't they adding, aren't they adding like obi-wan Kenobi?

1238
01:04:17,139 --> 01:04:18,360
Three stooges is too,

1239
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:19,829
Pac-Man?

1240
01:04:19,829 --> 01:04:24,070
Pac-Man, how is Pac-Man not Boomer?

1241
01:04:24,070 --> 01:04:24,909
All right.

1242
01:04:24,909 --> 01:04:27,619
Where do I make change?

1243
01:04:27,619 --> 01:04:30,460
That's fucking weird.

1244
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:31,280
Oh my God.

1245
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:32,119
Why is it all the way over here?

1246
01:04:32,119 --> 01:04:38,260
What a terribly designed place.

1247
01:04:38,260 --> 01:04:43,920
Pac-Man's coming next week.

1248
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:46,619
They're gonna add all the Wizard of Oz characters.

1249
01:04:46,619 --> 01:04:51,619
Dorothy, Tin Man, the Tiger, the Scarecrow.

1250
01:04:52,780 --> 01:04:53,619
They're gonna add,

1251
01:04:53,619 --> 01:04:55,400
there was gonna be a Wizard of Oz update.

1252
01:04:55,400 --> 01:05:00,510
They're gonna add, okay.

1253
01:05:00,510 --> 01:05:01,349
They're gonna be,

1254
01:05:01,349 --> 01:05:03,630
I feel so pissed off about this.

1255
01:05:03,630 --> 01:05:05,769
I'm gonna have like FOMO on this.

1256
01:05:05,769 --> 01:05:07,849
Because if I don't make a bet here

1257
01:05:07,849 --> 01:05:10,750
and they add the Wizard of Oz characters like in a year,

1258
01:05:10,750 --> 01:05:11,590
I'm gonna be pissed

1259
01:05:11,590 --> 01:05:17,079
because I could have told you I was right.

1260
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:17,920
You know what I mean?

1261
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:19,179
Like I didn't say that.

1262
01:05:19,179 --> 01:05:25,150
I was, I may have started to say it, but I didn't say it.

1263
01:05:25,170 --> 01:05:30,130
Take a look at the other stores and the plaza.

1264
01:05:30,130 --> 01:05:31,800
How much are you gonna put up?

1265
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:35,320
There's no way they're gonna add the Wizard of Oz.

1266
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:40,570
What about like Willy Wonka, right?

1267
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:43,440
Also, I don't know why I'm attributing,

1268
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,880
fuck, this is what's happening.

1269
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:49,139
I am attributing all the slot machines in the casino

1270
01:05:49,139 --> 01:05:51,280
with what is popular with the Fortnite kids,

1271
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,659
which is completely inaccurate.

1272
01:05:53,659 --> 01:05:57,159
Willy Wonka slot machines are literally fucking everywhere.

1273
01:05:57,159 --> 01:06:01,280
Wizard of Oz slot machines everywhere.

1274
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:07,030
The three stooges have a bunch of slot machines.

1275
01:06:07,030 --> 01:06:12,400
I'm doing this wrong.

1276
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:18,980
I still think, sounds like a child crying,

1277
01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:31,780
but I don't think it's a kid.

1278
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:35,570
Shoes.

1279
01:06:35,570 --> 01:06:37,010
That's cause boomers play slot machines

1280
01:06:37,010 --> 01:06:41,260
and zoomers bet on Fortnite skins.

1281
01:06:41,260 --> 01:06:44,800
Just wait, I am, are you ready?

1282
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,460
Listen to me.

1283
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:47,420
You can, in a hundred years,

1284
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,650
you can go back and watch this clip.

1285
01:06:49,650 --> 01:06:52,329
They are going to have to pivot soon

1286
01:06:52,329 --> 01:06:54,460
in these Vegas casinos

1287
01:06:54,460 --> 01:06:56,860
because all the Wizard of Oz slot machines

1288
01:06:56,860 --> 01:07:00,239
are not gonna do very well when the zoomers are like,

1289
01:07:00,239 --> 01:07:03,659
no, no, no, no, I want, where's my Fortnite machine?

1290
01:07:03,679 --> 01:07:06,079
There's gonna be Fortnite machines.

1291
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:10,650
There's gonna be video game, like zoomer type machines.

1292
01:07:10,650 --> 01:07:11,489
There's not, I don't think,

1293
01:07:11,489 --> 01:07:16,300
I think slot machines might be replaced, but like skins.

1294
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:18,179
You sit down and you like pull the machine.

1295
01:07:18,179 --> 01:07:22,280
It's like the skin, like a box opening.

1296
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:24,440
I think, I don't know in like the next 50 years or so,

1297
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:28,690
if people are gonna care that much about spinning a slot,

1298
01:07:28,690 --> 01:07:31,010
just in making, oh, like I hit money.

1299
01:07:31,010 --> 01:07:32,050
I don't think so.

1300
01:07:32,050 --> 01:07:35,110
I don't think the younger generation cares that much.

1301
01:07:35,110 --> 01:07:38,380
I think like Fortnite skins might be more,

1302
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:41,739
or some type of video game thing.

1303
01:07:41,739 --> 01:07:43,610
A Morbius slot machine.

1304
01:07:43,610 --> 01:07:45,260
I'd play it.

1305
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:46,420
I'd never even seen the movie.

1306
01:07:46,420 --> 01:07:52,159
I would just sit there and like laugh.

1307
01:07:52,159 --> 01:07:53,599
Morbius slots.

1308
01:07:53,599 --> 01:08:05,880
Customer, looking for a TV, toaster?

1309
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:09,659
Sorry, I'm just browsing.

1310
01:08:09,659 --> 01:08:12,460
What kind of person just browses the appliance stores

1311
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:16,199
at this time of night?

1312
01:08:16,199 --> 01:08:20,199
I don't know if I, I mean, anytime I go to like a Best Buy,

1313
01:08:20,199 --> 01:08:23,039
I always just end up walking around the washer

1314
01:08:23,039 --> 01:08:27,659
and dryers and stoves and just go, oh, that's nice.

1315
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:28,880
I'm never gonna buy one of those,

1316
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:32,420
but you kind of just walk around and just open up the lid,

1317
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:34,970
turn the dial.

1318
01:08:34,970 --> 01:08:35,810
That's it.

1319
01:08:35,810 --> 01:08:36,930
I'm just waiting on my laundry.

1320
01:08:36,930 --> 01:08:40,489
Well, then why don't you just buy a washer and dry here?

1321
01:08:40,489 --> 01:08:44,090
We have the newest models at the lowest prices.

1322
01:08:44,090 --> 01:08:48,420
That's such a stoner thing to do.

1323
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:50,479
I've never heard of a stoner that's like,

1324
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:53,479
yo, bro, let's go look at the washing machines

1325
01:08:53,479 --> 01:08:58,510
at Best Buy, dude.

1326
01:08:58,510 --> 01:09:03,270
No, it's like, I've been abducted by aliens

1327
01:09:03,270 --> 01:09:05,189
and like, I think aliens exist.

1328
01:09:05,189 --> 01:09:07,850
And like, I think the aliens are all,

1329
01:09:07,850 --> 01:09:11,350
are putting the TV shows on the TV stations.

1330
01:09:11,350 --> 01:09:16,729
That's like a, I'm high conversation.

1331
01:09:16,729 --> 01:09:19,289
I'm a fan, but I feel like you're the newest thing

1332
01:09:19,289 --> 01:09:21,899
in the store.

1333
01:09:21,899 --> 01:09:24,579
That's meth.

1334
01:09:24,579 --> 01:09:25,539
Well, thank you.

1335
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,680
You take pride in my appearance.

1336
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:29,720
Oh, wait, question marks.

1337
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:30,539
What are you talking about?

1338
01:09:30,539 --> 01:09:33,680
You talk about like weird existential shit when you're high.

1339
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:45,079
Not, I want to go look at Best Buy washing machines.

1340
01:09:45,079 --> 01:09:46,579
Now, when you get high, you think about,

1341
01:09:46,579 --> 01:09:49,100
are all my friends actors?

1342
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:50,760
You know what I mean?

1343
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:56,729
Not, oh, I want to go look at the washing machine.

1344
01:09:56,729 --> 01:10:03,050
Customer, looking for a TV, toaster.

1345
01:10:03,050 --> 01:10:04,890
What are you talking about?

1346
01:10:04,890 --> 01:10:06,449
I'm not saying you really think that.

1347
01:10:06,449 --> 01:10:09,479
You sit there in the couch and you go,

1348
01:10:09,479 --> 01:10:12,800
holy shit, what if like, we're all actors?

1349
01:10:15,710 --> 01:10:20,100
You guys don't have those gone, what?

1350
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:22,239
I don't, I've never gotten high and gone,

1351
01:10:22,239 --> 01:10:23,640
everybody's an actor.

1352
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:26,359
No, I've got, I'm go, man, wouldn't it be crazy

1353
01:10:26,359 --> 01:10:30,699
if everybody was an actor?

1354
01:10:30,699 --> 01:10:32,699
Sorry, I'm just browsing.

1355
01:10:34,710 --> 01:10:36,050
You're delusional.

1356
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:41,359
I keep talking to this person.

1357
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:43,079
Get away from me.

1358
01:10:43,079 --> 01:10:44,680
Okay, what do you got here?

1359
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:50,760
TV?

1360
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:53,520
Oh, look, drying machine.

1361
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:57,279
Oh, wow, that could fit probably like two, three loads.

1362
01:10:57,279 --> 01:10:59,760
Cool.

1363
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,199
No, you know, I'm not a big fan of the front loaders.

1364
01:11:02,199 --> 01:11:10,880
I'm not a front loader guy, no, not really, no.

1365
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:16,239
Oven, stereo, radio, can I,

1366
01:11:16,239 --> 01:11:17,560
what am I supposed to do here?

1367
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:19,109
A lock box.

1368
01:11:19,109 --> 01:11:20,430
I need a code to go in it.

1369
01:11:20,449 --> 01:11:30,539
Okay, I need a code for the lock box.

1370
01:11:30,539 --> 01:11:31,899
Okay, well, goodbye.

1371
01:11:31,899 --> 01:11:42,500
I need a code for the lock box.

1372
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:55,300
Pizza.

1373
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:57,260
Sorry, didn't see you there.

1374
01:11:57,260 --> 01:11:58,100
What time is it?

1375
01:11:58,100 --> 01:11:59,699
Can I get you anything?

1376
01:11:59,699 --> 01:12:00,819
No, thanks.

1377
01:12:00,819 --> 01:12:03,800
I'm just killing time until my laundry next door is done.

1378
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:06,619
Well, you're out. How about it was supposed to be late?

1379
01:12:06,619 --> 01:12:09,720
Just a heads up, we're closing soon.

1380
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:11,680
Feel free to hang out until then, though.

1381
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:13,319
Ask for pizza?

1382
01:12:13,319 --> 01:12:15,430
What do you got here?

1383
01:12:15,430 --> 01:12:19,090
They're about to close, so the pizza is pretty stale now.

1384
01:12:19,090 --> 01:12:20,170
That's not what I asked.

1385
01:12:20,430 --> 01:12:24,899
I'm fine, that's all right.

1386
01:12:24,899 --> 01:12:30,649
Soda fountain, trash can.

1387
01:12:30,649 --> 01:12:33,319
Any codes in here?

1388
01:12:33,319 --> 01:12:37,960
This is, what is this?

1389
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:39,039
Sin eater.

1390
01:12:42,109 --> 01:12:50,430
I knew the whole thing.

1391
01:12:50,430 --> 01:12:52,529
I did not realize that was gonna be that flashing.

1392
01:12:52,529 --> 01:12:53,369
I'm sorry.

1393
01:12:54,310 --> 01:12:55,710
I thought it was gonna be,

1394
01:12:55,710 --> 01:12:56,989
I thought it was gonna be colors.

1395
01:12:56,989 --> 01:12:58,710
I didn't know it was gonna be black and white.

1396
01:12:58,710 --> 01:13:00,029
I'm really sorry.

1397
01:13:00,029 --> 01:13:02,569
I thought it was gonna be like this one.

1398
01:13:02,569 --> 01:13:04,449
I thought it was gonna be like this one.

1399
01:13:04,449 --> 01:13:07,350
Like, look, that's not a problem doing it like this.

1400
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:08,449
I didn't know it was gonna be black and white.

1401
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:09,390
I'm really sorry.

1402
01:13:09,390 --> 01:13:10,710
That actually, I didn't know it was gonna be that painful.

1403
01:13:10,710 --> 01:13:14,220
I'm actually really sorry.

1404
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:16,939
I was trying to inhale the magazine.

1405
01:13:16,939 --> 01:13:18,939
I just got flash-banked.

1406
01:13:18,939 --> 01:13:36,579
What the fuck is this?

1407
01:13:36,579 --> 01:13:47,500
Okay, guys, that's a dick.

1408
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:52,989
Okay, well, sorry.

1409
01:13:52,989 --> 01:13:54,829
That's back-to-back, kind of.

1410
01:13:54,829 --> 01:13:56,029
I didn't mean to do that.

1411
01:13:56,029 --> 01:13:58,590
I thought that was not gonna be as flashing,

1412
01:13:58,590 --> 01:14:03,800
and then you got flashed anyways a few moments later.

1413
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:06,060
So I'm really sorry about that, back-to-back.

1414
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:11,600
Nobody else is gonna, okay, very sorry.

1415
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,739
Can I do anything else in here?

1416
01:14:13,739 --> 01:14:14,819
I get nothing.

1417
01:14:14,819 --> 01:14:17,119
Well, you're out.

1418
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:23,680
No pizza, vending machine, no.

1419
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:25,039
You flash-banked your audience

1420
01:14:25,039 --> 01:14:30,289
and then showed him a dick, great start.

1421
01:14:30,289 --> 01:14:32,729
Shit, I wanna be more careful with that.

1422
01:14:32,729 --> 01:14:33,569
I didn't know.

1423
01:14:33,569 --> 01:14:39,539
I actually am annoyed that I just did that.

1424
01:14:39,539 --> 01:14:46,800
All right, so where are we going now?

1425
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:52,399
Peapaws?

1426
01:14:52,399 --> 01:14:56,600
No refunds or exchanges, all sales final.

1427
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:57,439
Peapaw.

1428
01:14:57,439 --> 01:14:58,760
Can I help you?

1429
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:02,520
Looking for anything specific?

1430
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:04,880
Looking for something specific?

1431
01:15:04,899 --> 01:15:06,840
You have a great day now.

1432
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:08,039
A movie?

1433
01:15:08,039 --> 01:15:10,020
A video game?

1434
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:11,340
Fish?

1435
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:17,470
No, just browsing, thanks.

1436
01:15:17,470 --> 01:15:23,100
Let me know if you need any help.

1437
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:25,619
And don't you even think about stealing anything?

1438
01:15:25,619 --> 01:15:30,159
I have eyes everywhere.

1439
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:31,760
Wouldn't dream of it.

1440
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:33,399
You have quite an assortment of-

1441
01:15:33,399 --> 01:15:35,520
It's Peapaws.

1442
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:37,079
I'm Peapaw.

1443
01:15:37,079 --> 01:15:39,840
It's my store.

1444
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:40,680
PeaPants.

1445
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:45,090
Right.

1446
01:15:45,090 --> 01:15:47,170
Am I allowed to tell the story of PeaPants?

1447
01:15:49,159 --> 01:15:50,640
I mean, I tell it like once every two years,

1448
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:52,760
but I feel like we have a lot more viewers here now.

1449
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:58,430
Can I just do your TLDR?

1450
01:15:58,430 --> 01:15:59,880
What is that?

1451
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:01,100
Read Reapers, what?

1452
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:02,579
No, I'm not doing this.

1453
01:16:02,579 --> 01:16:08,920
I mean, this is cool.

1454
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:09,840
This is, I mean, this is cool.

1455
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:12,119
They got like these comics in here.

1456
01:16:12,119 --> 01:16:13,720
This is cool.

1457
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:16,800
They got comic books you can read.

1458
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:17,960
Okay, well, we're gonna have,

1459
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:19,520
we're gonna just go like this for now.

1460
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:20,359
We're gonna go like this.

1461
01:16:20,359 --> 01:16:21,859
We're just gonna get rid of those.

1462
01:16:21,859 --> 01:16:22,880
Okay, cool.

1463
01:16:29,409 --> 01:16:33,729
There's probably an item in here.

1464
01:16:33,729 --> 01:16:38,930
Or no, tapes.

1465
01:16:38,930 --> 01:16:40,649
Okay, get it.

1466
01:16:40,649 --> 01:16:42,569
I'm putting my hand up over this screen.

1467
01:16:42,569 --> 01:16:44,060
What am I doing?

1468
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:44,899
What am I doing?

1469
01:16:44,899 --> 01:16:46,279
What?

1470
01:16:46,279 --> 01:16:47,420
I can't put my hand up on,

1471
01:16:47,420 --> 01:16:49,420
I just put my hand up to block it

1472
01:16:49,420 --> 01:16:51,020
like you were behind me.

1473
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:52,020
Hold on.

1474
01:16:52,020 --> 01:16:52,859
What the fuck?

1475
01:16:52,859 --> 01:16:57,529
Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.

1476
01:16:57,529 --> 01:17:03,640
Does that, do I need to be in here for anything?

1477
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:05,060
I swear to God, there's probably something in here

1478
01:17:05,060 --> 01:17:06,970
that I need to get.

1479
01:17:06,970 --> 01:17:08,130
Okay, okay.

1480
01:17:12,180 --> 01:17:13,020
I was looking.

1481
01:17:14,140 --> 01:17:15,899
That's not what you wanna have happen

1482
01:17:15,899 --> 01:17:17,859
coming out of this room.

1483
01:17:17,859 --> 01:17:19,060
This is like, you put the hat down,

1484
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:21,199
and you go like this, and you're like.

1485
01:17:21,199 --> 01:17:25,409
No, hey, how are ya?

1486
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:28,819
You're not stealing anything?

1487
01:17:28,819 --> 01:17:30,420
No.

1488
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:44,039
My apologies.

1489
01:17:44,039 --> 01:17:46,199
My friend was making a joke about,

1490
01:17:46,199 --> 01:17:48,680
let's go into the porn section,

1491
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:50,800
and it was funny, it was like,

1492
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:51,640
you have one of these?

1493
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:52,779
That's crazy.

1494
01:17:52,779 --> 01:17:53,619
I was just saying,

1495
01:17:53,619 --> 01:17:55,199
I couldn't believe you actually had one of these.

1496
01:17:55,199 --> 01:17:56,039
This is crazy.

1497
01:17:56,039 --> 01:17:56,880
Like, what the fuck?

1498
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:02,279
I was going into it, like, that's funny.

1499
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:21,000
Should I buy a gumball?

1500
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,960
Ooh, games.

1501
01:18:23,739 --> 01:18:24,779
The Master system is out now.

1502
01:18:24,779 --> 01:18:27,199
This is still my favorite.

1503
01:18:27,199 --> 01:18:28,960
Okay, I don't think I,

1504
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:30,960
my laundry has probably been done for an hour.

1505
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:39,819
What am I doing still here?

1506
01:18:39,819 --> 01:18:41,340
Oh, the story of pee pants, right.

1507
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:42,430
Okay.

1508
01:18:42,430 --> 01:18:46,239
So, Burger Boy and I used to play Smite all the time,

1509
01:18:46,239 --> 01:18:47,699
and we would just, you know,

1510
01:18:47,699 --> 01:18:49,439
you'd make the,

1511
01:18:49,439 --> 01:18:51,359
I think it was like a party or something.

1512
01:18:51,359 --> 01:18:53,199
You had to like join with a password or something,

1513
01:18:53,199 --> 01:18:55,220
whatever it was.

1514
01:18:55,220 --> 01:18:57,380
So, we would be playing games,

1515
01:18:57,380 --> 01:18:59,880
and we'd be making the,

1516
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:01,279
yeah, Smite, okay, whatever, fine.

1517
01:19:01,899 --> 01:19:03,840
You batch-ass me all you want.

1518
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:06,340
So, we were in the,

1519
01:19:06,340 --> 01:19:08,989
essentially, I was being told,

1520
01:19:08,989 --> 01:19:11,350
hey, here's the password to get into the lobby,

1521
01:19:11,350 --> 01:19:13,869
so then we can queue up together or whatever it was.

1522
01:19:13,869 --> 01:19:16,029
So, he gives me the password.

1523
01:19:16,029 --> 01:19:16,869
He's like, hey, this is it,

1524
01:19:16,869 --> 01:19:17,909
the password is pee pants.

1525
01:19:17,909 --> 01:19:18,750
And I was like, okay, fine.

1526
01:19:18,750 --> 01:19:20,449
So, I'm like, pee pants.

1527
01:19:20,449 --> 01:19:21,270
It doesn't work.

1528
01:19:21,270 --> 01:19:22,109
So, the password is incorrect.

1529
01:19:22,109 --> 01:19:24,119
I say, hey, dude, the password is incorrect.

1530
01:19:24,119 --> 01:19:26,039
This doesn't, there's no,

1531
01:19:26,039 --> 01:19:27,649
it's not pee pants.

1532
01:19:27,649 --> 01:19:29,550
And Burger Boy looks at me and he just goes,

1533
01:19:29,550 --> 01:19:30,850
yeah, it is.

1534
01:19:30,850 --> 01:19:32,289
By the way, Burger Boy was high.

1535
01:19:32,289 --> 01:19:34,449
He was like as high as a kite.

1536
01:19:35,350 --> 01:19:37,350
And he's sitting there going, it's pee pants, dude.

1537
01:19:37,350 --> 01:19:39,310
I was like, Burger Boy, it's not.

1538
01:19:39,310 --> 01:19:40,149
Is there a space?

1539
01:19:40,149 --> 01:19:42,329
Is it like pee space pants?

1540
01:19:42,329 --> 01:19:46,109
No, it's just no spaces, no capitals, pee pants.

1541
01:19:46,109 --> 01:19:49,109
I'm just like, I keep typing that, it's not it.

1542
01:19:49,109 --> 01:19:51,069
And me and him get into an argument

1543
01:19:51,069 --> 01:19:54,510
about how he thinks I'm fucking with him

1544
01:19:54,510 --> 01:19:58,300
because it's pee pants and you're not doing it

1545
01:19:58,300 --> 01:20:01,220
and this is annoying and I wanna play.

1546
01:20:01,220 --> 01:20:03,260
So, eventually, finally, after probably

1547
01:20:03,260 --> 01:20:04,939
at least three to five straight minutes

1548
01:20:04,939 --> 01:20:07,460
of being annoyed with each other,

1549
01:20:07,460 --> 01:20:09,920
I go, how are you spelling this?

1550
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:12,319
And I walk over and I show him what I'm typing

1551
01:20:12,319 --> 01:20:13,479
and he's like, what?

1552
01:20:13,479 --> 01:20:19,859
This not, he's like, this, pee pants.

1553
01:20:19,859 --> 01:20:23,579
That's how we thought it was spelled.

1554
01:20:23,579 --> 01:20:29,239
He thought it was P-A-N-C-E in his like high weed brain.

1555
01:20:29,239 --> 01:20:31,140
So, we were actually in a pretty,

1556
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:33,840
it was, I was not, we were both pretty annoyed

1557
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:36,239
and he was spelling it P-A-N-C-E

1558
01:20:36,239 --> 01:20:40,779
and that's how we thought pants was spelled in that moment.

1559
01:20:40,779 --> 01:20:43,680
And then, finally, he sat there

1560
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:46,289
and he was just like laughing his ass off

1561
01:20:47,189 --> 01:20:50,210
and then pee pants just became a verb

1562
01:20:50,210 --> 01:20:52,789
that we just started using.

1563
01:20:52,789 --> 01:20:54,069
We would call each other that

1564
01:20:54,069 --> 01:20:56,439
if we had like a stupid moment.

1565
01:20:56,439 --> 01:20:57,800
It'd be like, oh, hey, yeah, hey, pee pants.

1566
01:20:57,800 --> 01:20:59,880
Oh, come on, pee pants.

1567
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:01,119
Like, we just started calling each other that.

1568
01:21:01,119 --> 01:21:04,729
We started using it as a verb and stuff.

1569
01:21:04,729 --> 01:21:07,600
Oh, dude, that's, you're a wicked pee pants right now.

1570
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:09,640
Oh, yeah, okay, yeah.

1571
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:10,560
It was fun.

1572
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:12,239
Using it as a noun, verb.

1573
01:21:12,239 --> 01:21:14,420
We pretty much used it as,

1574
01:21:14,420 --> 01:21:17,859
we used to use random words, kind of like smurfs.

1575
01:21:17,859 --> 01:21:20,619
We'd replace them as nouns and verbs

1576
01:21:20,619 --> 01:21:22,960
and it was just a smurf language.

1577
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:23,859
It was weird.

1578
01:21:23,859 --> 01:21:32,039
We used to do it all the time with tons of stuff.

1579
01:21:32,039 --> 01:21:35,050
Who the fuck is Burger Boy?

1580
01:21:35,050 --> 01:21:51,800
Oh, that's a new viewers.

1581
01:21:51,800 --> 01:22:00,119
Okay, so I think I'm ready.

1582
01:22:00,119 --> 01:22:04,340
Okay, I thought someone was coming to get me.

1583
01:22:04,340 --> 01:22:05,720
Why is he called Burger Boy though?

1584
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:06,539
I don't know.

1585
01:22:06,539 --> 01:22:07,380
Maybe it has something to do with the fact

1586
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:08,840
that he used to bring double cheeseburgers

1587
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:09,960
into the movie theater.

1588
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:12,609
Like they were popcorn.

1589
01:22:12,609 --> 01:22:14,930
Like a bag of at least four to six of them

1590
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:16,779
and eat them for the movie.

1591
01:22:16,779 --> 01:22:26,729
That might have had something to do with it.

1592
01:22:26,729 --> 01:22:28,699
Did I get the laundry?

1593
01:22:28,699 --> 01:22:35,529
You haven't said that.

1594
01:22:35,529 --> 01:22:36,529
How do I use the dryers?

1595
01:22:36,529 --> 01:22:54,989
Are these washers?

1596
01:22:54,989 --> 01:22:59,579
Bathroom key?

1597
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:00,439
That's old lore.

1598
01:23:00,439 --> 01:23:02,500
Oh yeah, that's, I mean,

1599
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:07,199
I know I've told that story before.

1600
01:23:07,199 --> 01:23:15,659
Okay, so go to the bathroom.

1601
01:23:15,659 --> 01:23:17,859
You've told the pee pants stream a bunch of times too.

1602
01:23:17,859 --> 01:23:20,800
Oh yeah.

1603
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:21,640
Do you guys still talk?

1604
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:27,609
Yeah, from time to time.

1605
01:23:27,609 --> 01:23:30,720
I think he's doing all right.

1606
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:32,460
Just living on the West Coast.

1607
01:23:32,460 --> 01:23:35,600
A lot of people that I would talk to on a regular basis.

1608
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:37,789
Obviously I live in Vegas, right?

1609
01:23:37,789 --> 01:23:40,770
But yeah, I think he's doing pretty good.

1610
01:23:40,770 --> 01:23:44,409
Last time I talked to him.

1611
01:23:44,409 --> 01:23:54,739
Don't I have the key?

1612
01:23:54,739 --> 01:24:09,210
God damn it.

1613
01:24:09,210 --> 01:24:12,420
Now I'm gonna read that.

1614
01:24:12,420 --> 01:24:15,189
Six, seven, five, eight.

1615
01:24:15,189 --> 01:24:16,670
This might be fun to call if I get bored.

1616
01:24:16,729 --> 01:24:19,170
There's a phone in the lobby.

1617
01:24:19,170 --> 01:24:21,449
Really?

1618
01:24:21,449 --> 01:24:36,500
Really?

1619
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:40,670
Wait, why did I go in here?

1620
01:24:40,670 --> 01:24:41,750
There's something I need?

1621
01:24:41,750 --> 01:24:43,439
Police report.

1622
01:24:43,439 --> 01:24:47,119
Police report that details a suspect named Lewis Kennedy.

1623
01:24:47,119 --> 01:24:49,119
This is just for public intoxication,

1624
01:24:49,119 --> 01:24:50,659
but that name keeps popping up.

1625
01:24:50,659 --> 01:24:52,659
Wonder if I can find out more about him.

1626
01:24:52,659 --> 01:24:54,319
Bring this to the people and see if they have anything

1627
01:24:54,319 --> 01:24:56,119
to say about it.

1628
01:24:56,119 --> 01:24:57,220
Do something funny.

1629
01:24:57,220 --> 01:24:58,300
Your dog is crying.

1630
01:24:58,300 --> 01:25:03,859
Why does your dog care if I make a joke or not?

1631
01:25:03,859 --> 01:25:06,039
Oh my God, there's somebody in here.

1632
01:25:06,039 --> 01:25:08,989
Oh my God.

1633
01:25:08,989 --> 01:25:13,840
Is there an item I need over here or anything?

1634
01:25:13,899 --> 01:25:14,739
Dude, okay.

1635
01:25:14,739 --> 01:25:19,699
This is probably something I need right here.

1636
01:25:19,699 --> 01:25:21,659
Nothing?

1637
01:25:21,659 --> 01:25:31,590
Okay, goodbye.

1638
01:25:31,590 --> 01:25:33,229
What is, who's that?

1639
01:25:39,810 --> 01:25:41,050
What happened?

1640
01:25:41,050 --> 01:25:42,449
I feel like I was supposed to be scared.

1641
01:25:42,449 --> 01:25:45,180
I was like, why is there a naked guy?

1642
01:25:45,180 --> 01:25:50,340
What happened?

1643
01:25:50,340 --> 01:25:51,260
I just turned the quarter

1644
01:25:51,260 --> 01:25:52,539
and I thought there was a naked person

1645
01:25:52,539 --> 01:25:53,460
so I just went like this

1646
01:25:53,460 --> 01:25:56,949
and then I was supposed to get jump scared, I think.

1647
01:25:56,949 --> 01:25:57,789
Who put this here?

1648
01:25:57,789 --> 01:26:05,779
I don't know.

1649
01:26:05,779 --> 01:26:07,399
Did you do that?

1650
01:26:07,399 --> 01:26:09,140
Doing the late night wash too.

1651
01:26:09,140 --> 01:26:14,050
Yeah, I work night shift at the factory down the road.

1652
01:26:14,050 --> 01:26:15,729
This place is the only one open.

1653
01:26:15,729 --> 01:26:17,470
Yeah, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know,

1654
01:26:17,470 --> 01:26:19,109
we know, we know, we know, we know, we know.

1655
01:26:19,109 --> 01:26:19,949
Mysterious.

1656
01:26:21,270 --> 01:26:22,510
Doing the late night wash.

1657
01:26:22,510 --> 01:26:24,270
The first one, that's good, but what?

1658
01:26:25,449 --> 01:26:27,149
Okay, don't click again.

1659
01:26:27,149 --> 01:26:30,199
Do you know anything about this?

1660
01:26:30,199 --> 01:26:31,800
No, not these comic books.

1661
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:32,640
This.

1662
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:36,840
Don't know how you got that, but yeah, I knew Louis.

1663
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:39,899
He owned the old laundromat that burnt down.

1664
01:26:39,899 --> 01:26:44,470
We were buds, but he disappeared one day.

1665
01:26:44,470 --> 01:26:46,390
It's the aliens, I tell ya.

1666
01:26:46,390 --> 01:26:49,170
Louis is looking down on us poor schmucks right now

1667
01:26:49,170 --> 01:26:51,329
from the cosmos.

1668
01:26:51,329 --> 01:26:52,529
Do you know anything about this?

1669
01:26:52,529 --> 01:27:08,989
Shows him a porno mag.

1670
01:27:08,989 --> 01:27:15,270
So I just gotta show this to people in the town

1671
01:27:15,270 --> 01:27:16,329
that sounds like you.

1672
01:27:16,329 --> 01:27:17,430
Call that number.

1673
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:23,699
Don't tell me what to do.

1674
01:27:23,699 --> 01:27:28,510
Okay, where's the phone?

1675
01:27:28,510 --> 01:27:29,350
Oh, what?

1676
01:27:29,350 --> 01:27:31,029
The phone is ringing.

1677
01:27:31,029 --> 01:27:35,699
You will be connected to the girl

1678
01:27:35,699 --> 01:27:38,539
of your wildest fantasies for 63 seconds.

1679
01:27:39,619 --> 01:27:42,380
Well, hey there, stud.

1680
01:27:42,380 --> 01:27:43,800
All right, for one second,

1681
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:48,560
one second I thought she said 63 seconds

1682
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:50,000
in English accent.

1683
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:54,800
Not 63 seconds, 63.

1684
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:57,300
You'll be connected for 63 seconds.

1685
01:27:57,300 --> 01:27:58,140
I was like, what?

1686
01:27:58,140 --> 01:27:58,960
Oh, okay, that's a weird number.

1687
01:27:58,960 --> 01:27:59,800
And then I read it.

1688
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:03,310
Cool, no?

1689
01:28:03,310 --> 01:28:07,149
I mean, hey there.

1690
01:28:07,149 --> 01:28:09,489
I'm so glad you called.

1691
01:28:09,489 --> 01:28:12,409
It's been so lonely over here.

1692
01:28:12,409 --> 01:28:14,930
Been thinking about your big cut.

1693
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:17,500
Wait.

1694
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:18,779
Damn it, I'm sorry.

1695
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:20,800
This is my first night on the job.

1696
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:24,000
I don't think it's for me.

1697
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:24,840
That's okay.

1698
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:27,640
I didn't even know what this number was for.

1699
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:29,159
I just called for cakes.

1700
01:28:29,159 --> 01:28:30,479
The phone rang.

1701
01:28:30,479 --> 01:28:32,760
Oh, it's been one night,

1702
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:34,760
but I've had my fair share of creeps.

1703
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:37,029
Didn't the phone ring?

1704
01:28:37,029 --> 01:28:37,869
I didn't call.

1705
01:28:37,869 --> 01:28:40,909
I answered the phone.

1706
01:28:40,909 --> 01:28:42,750
A person just dials a random phone number

1707
01:28:42,750 --> 01:28:44,390
at this time of night.

1708
01:28:44,390 --> 01:28:45,750
A burnt out college student

1709
01:28:45,750 --> 01:28:46,590
who's waiting for on-

1710
01:28:46,590 --> 01:28:47,909
I didn't make any phone calls.

1711
01:28:47,909 --> 01:28:50,270
Go home and get some sleep.

1712
01:28:50,270 --> 01:28:52,789
Those places are still open at this time of night?

1713
01:28:53,939 --> 01:28:56,619
Not just this one a little out of town.

1714
01:28:56,619 --> 01:29:01,279
Wait, in that plaza with the pizza palace?

1715
01:29:01,279 --> 01:29:06,199
Oh, that one.

1716
01:29:06,199 --> 01:29:08,199
Hey, you really shouldn't be out over there

1717
01:29:08,199 --> 01:29:09,039
this late at night,

1718
01:29:09,039 --> 01:29:10,840
not with the womb ripper at large.

1719
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:12,460
I remember,

1720
01:29:12,460 --> 01:29:15,180
do you guys remember the commercials late at night on TV

1721
01:29:15,180 --> 01:29:18,420
for these lines that were 1-900 numbers?

1722
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:20,420
It's like, call now

1723
01:29:20,420 --> 01:29:23,699
and talk to the hardest of all of us, right?

1724
01:29:23,699 --> 01:29:25,779
Now, do you remember those?

1725
01:29:25,779 --> 01:29:28,600
And it was always like two or three dollars a minute.

1726
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:31,289
I remember just sitting there going,

1727
01:29:32,149 --> 01:29:33,229
I wonder,

1728
01:29:33,229 --> 01:29:38,039
do they like try to keep people on the phone?

1729
01:29:38,039 --> 01:29:41,739
And the more that I thought about it is like,

1730
01:29:41,739 --> 01:29:43,260
oh, I'm trying to think of ways

1731
01:29:43,260 --> 01:29:44,100
if you would keep somebody on the phone

1732
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:45,800
for two dollars a minute.

1733
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:47,949
And one of the things I was thinking of was,

1734
01:29:47,949 --> 01:29:49,869
oh yeah, it would be so sexy

1735
01:29:49,869 --> 01:29:52,949
if we played a full game of Monopoly over the phone.

1736
01:29:52,949 --> 01:29:55,989
Oh, I would think that was so hot.

1737
01:29:55,989 --> 01:29:57,029
Yeah, you do?

1738
01:29:57,029 --> 01:30:00,189
Yeah, yeah.

1739
01:30:00,189 --> 01:30:01,270
That'd be like,

1740
01:30:01,270 --> 01:30:02,189
oh, you know,

1741
01:30:02,189 --> 01:30:06,210
if we could play Risk, that would be fantastic.

1742
01:30:06,210 --> 01:30:09,869
Just gave them there.

1743
01:30:09,890 --> 01:30:10,970
They were always so weird, though.

1744
01:30:10,970 --> 01:30:12,210
I remember just being,

1745
01:30:12,210 --> 01:30:14,449
because I was an infomercial aficionado, right?

1746
01:30:14,449 --> 01:30:15,939
We all know that.

1747
01:30:15,939 --> 01:30:17,659
But in between those,

1748
01:30:17,659 --> 01:30:22,579
or on random channels at the past 12, 1 a.m.,

1749
01:30:22,579 --> 01:30:31,899
you'd get those ads all the time.

1750
01:30:31,899 --> 01:30:34,199
You called them.

1751
01:30:34,199 --> 01:30:36,079
Do you guys really think,

1752
01:30:40,409 --> 01:30:47,180
so I'm gonna call and have sent to my parents' house?

1753
01:30:47,180 --> 01:30:48,699
Huh?

1754
01:30:48,699 --> 01:30:50,060
I wasn't even fucking old enough

1755
01:30:50,060 --> 01:30:52,470
to make these phone calls, I don't think.

1756
01:30:52,470 --> 01:30:55,659
Why would I, what are you talking about?

1757
01:30:55,680 --> 01:31:00,850
I am in no way going to have my mother or father back then

1758
01:31:01,859 --> 01:31:04,260
be like, why is there,

1759
01:31:04,260 --> 01:31:05,859
why is there all this shit here?

1760
01:31:05,859 --> 01:31:07,859
Why would there, I never thought they were worth it.

1761
01:31:07,859 --> 01:31:11,859
I was like, I'm not gonna call these.

1762
01:31:11,859 --> 01:31:13,659
I'm like, I don't know, I don't wanna do that.

1763
01:31:13,659 --> 01:31:15,470
That's weird.

1764
01:31:15,470 --> 01:31:16,770
He's offended.

1765
01:31:16,770 --> 01:31:22,119
What an obvious lie.

1766
01:31:22,119 --> 01:31:25,720
The 30 second call the 1-900 number

1767
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:28,279
that we're just talking, taking the piss on right now.

1768
01:31:28,279 --> 01:31:30,739
You think I was calling it every day?

1769
01:31:32,479 --> 01:31:34,640
You're weirdly defensive about this.

1770
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:37,600
I have not called one of these numbers.

1771
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:41,529
I was with one eye open like this.

1772
01:31:41,529 --> 01:31:42,689
What's that on TV?

1773
01:31:42,689 --> 01:31:44,939
I don't fucking care.

1774
01:31:44,939 --> 01:31:46,300
Where's Kathy Mitchell?

1775
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:47,140
Right, no.

1776
01:31:49,140 --> 01:31:50,760
No.

1777
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:52,319
Why do I do this to myself?

1778
01:31:52,319 --> 01:31:53,279
Why do I do this?

1779
01:31:53,279 --> 01:31:54,720
Why are you doing this to me?

1780
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:55,720
Listen to me.

1781
01:31:55,720 --> 01:31:59,359
I mean, infomercials, infomercials, infomercials,

1782
01:31:59,359 --> 01:32:01,720
infomercials, I wanted to watch infomercials,

1783
01:32:02,380 --> 01:32:04,420
call fucking, okay.

1784
01:32:04,420 --> 01:32:06,220
All right, that's enough.

1785
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:07,779
Why are you doing this to me?

1786
01:32:07,779 --> 01:32:10,020
That's enough, that's enough.

1787
01:32:10,020 --> 01:32:13,430
There's some things that the newspapers don't talk about.

1788
01:32:13,430 --> 01:32:26,310
There's things to get out of.

1789
01:32:26,310 --> 01:32:27,489
Look at how red I am.

1790
01:32:27,489 --> 01:32:28,789
I'm like embarrassed.

1791
01:32:28,789 --> 01:32:30,109
I don't want anybody to think this.

1792
01:32:30,109 --> 01:32:32,300
There's more to it than just talking and killing.

1793
01:32:32,300 --> 01:32:33,140
Fuck.

1794
01:32:33,140 --> 01:32:33,960
It's a real psychopath

1795
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:35,819
and you are right in the middle of its hunting grounds.

1796
01:32:35,819 --> 01:32:39,319
Do you understand? Shit, shit.

1797
01:32:39,319 --> 01:32:41,039
You need to take your laundry right now

1798
01:32:41,039 --> 01:32:43,279
and get out of there as fast as you can.

1799
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:45,539
That's like embarrassing.

1800
01:32:45,539 --> 01:32:47,460
What is going on in this dialogue?

1801
01:33:01,260 --> 01:33:02,859
It's the same reason why hotels,

1802
01:33:02,859 --> 01:33:06,760
when they had all the porn in the hotel rooms.

1803
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:09,470
I didn't want to check out of a hotel

1804
01:33:09,470 --> 01:33:14,470
and walk up to the person at the checkout counter

1805
01:33:15,390 --> 01:33:18,069
and, sir, would you like a receipt?

1806
01:33:18,069 --> 01:33:20,949
No, no, no.

1807
01:33:20,949 --> 01:33:22,029
Don't look at the receipt.

1808
01:33:22,029 --> 01:33:24,109
Just, you know what?

1809
01:33:24,109 --> 01:33:25,710
Here's $200 cash.

1810
01:33:25,729 --> 01:33:26,729
I don't want you to print the receipt.

1811
01:33:26,729 --> 01:33:28,130
I don't want you to look at the receipt.

1812
01:33:28,130 --> 01:33:31,289
Can you drag the receipt into the recycling bin right now?

1813
01:33:31,289 --> 01:33:34,100
I'll give you $200 right now.

1814
01:33:34,100 --> 01:33:36,699
Sir, it says you only have about $42 in charges.

1815
01:33:36,699 --> 01:33:37,539
No, just don't open it.

1816
01:33:37,539 --> 01:33:38,460
And here's $200 cash.

1817
01:33:38,460 --> 01:33:39,300
Don't look at the receipt.

1818
01:33:39,300 --> 01:33:41,899
Don't look at it.

1819
01:33:41,899 --> 01:33:42,739
I don't know.

1820
01:33:42,739 --> 01:33:44,640
I don't want to talk to somebody and be like,

1821
01:33:44,640 --> 01:33:45,479
oh, hey, by the way,

1822
01:33:45,479 --> 01:33:48,119
oh, what do we have with these charges?

1823
01:33:48,119 --> 01:33:52,090
Some incidental charges to the room.

1824
01:33:56,029 --> 01:34:03,829
No.

1825
01:34:03,829 --> 01:34:04,649
So you bought it.

1826
01:34:04,649 --> 01:34:05,489
No, I didn't.

1827
01:34:05,489 --> 01:34:06,329
I'm just saying.

1828
01:34:06,329 --> 01:34:08,680
I didn't want to have anybody.

1829
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:09,520
You're making it worse.

1830
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:10,340
This is a self-report.

1831
01:34:10,340 --> 01:34:11,180
No, it's not.

1832
01:34:11,180 --> 01:34:19,930
I'm watching porn in a hotel room.

1833
01:34:19,930 --> 01:34:22,609
No, I just want to sleep in the hotel room.

1834
01:34:22,609 --> 01:34:23,449
You know what I mean?

1835
01:34:23,449 --> 01:34:24,270
I don't want to do it.

1836
01:34:24,270 --> 01:34:26,250
No.

1837
01:34:26,250 --> 01:34:29,550
I don't want to sit there and just sit there and be like,

1838
01:34:29,550 --> 01:34:35,470
all right, here we go.

1839
01:34:35,470 --> 01:34:36,550
No.

1840
01:34:36,550 --> 01:34:37,430
Jerma, stop.

1841
01:34:37,430 --> 01:34:38,920
You need to act cool.

1842
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:39,760
Act cool.

1843
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:41,199
You got to act cool.

1844
01:34:41,199 --> 01:34:42,039
All right, all right.

1845
01:34:42,039 --> 01:34:42,859
I'll act cool.

1846
01:34:42,859 --> 01:34:48,869
All right, I'll act cool.

1847
01:34:48,869 --> 01:34:49,710
Okay.

1848
01:34:49,710 --> 01:34:50,529
Just be cool.

1849
01:34:50,529 --> 01:34:51,369
Be cool.

1850
01:34:51,369 --> 01:34:52,210
It's not a big deal.

1851
01:34:52,210 --> 01:34:57,619
Whatever.

1852
01:34:57,619 --> 01:34:58,460
Be cool.

1853
01:34:58,460 --> 01:34:59,300
This is actually so bad.

1854
01:34:59,300 --> 01:35:00,119
No, it's not.

1855
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,680
We made a couple of comments

1856
01:35:02,680 --> 01:35:05,880
about late night telephone sex lines

1857
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:09,840
and all of a sudden I buy porn every time I go to the hotel.

1858
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:11,680
That's you doing that.

1859
01:35:11,680 --> 01:35:14,119
That's you putting that on me.

1860
01:35:14,119 --> 01:35:15,720
We never talked about that.

1861
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:18,260
We literally never talked about that.

1862
01:35:18,260 --> 01:35:20,819
I made a quick comment about this

1863
01:35:20,819 --> 01:35:23,779
and it became literally what I do every day.

1864
01:35:23,779 --> 01:35:28,550
Lewis Kennedy.

1865
01:35:28,550 --> 01:35:32,880
Jerma watches porn and gets naked.

1866
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:33,720
Yeah.

1867
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:34,560
No, no.

1868
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:37,720
I get naked because I have to go take a shower and get naked.

1869
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:38,640
I'm done with this conversation.

1870
01:35:38,640 --> 01:35:40,279
Put it in emote only mode right now.

1871
01:35:40,279 --> 01:35:41,399
Put it in emote only mode.

1872
01:35:41,399 --> 01:35:44,159
I demand emote only mode right now.

1873
01:35:44,159 --> 01:35:55,500
Emotes only for an hour.

1874
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:56,420
Lewis Kennedy.

1875
01:35:56,420 --> 01:35:57,260
All right.

1876
01:35:57,260 --> 01:35:58,300
You never heard of Lewis Kennedy.

1877
01:35:58,300 --> 01:35:59,539
That's fine.

1878
01:35:59,539 --> 01:36:01,840
Anybody else here?

1879
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:13,880
Can I play this?

1880
01:36:13,880 --> 01:36:17,000
You look just like her.

1881
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:17,840
Who?

1882
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:18,840
Same eyes.

1883
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:19,920
I'm telling you it's me.

1884
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:20,920
Same hair.

1885
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:21,760
It's me.

1886
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:28,109
She used to be so beautiful,

1887
01:36:28,109 --> 01:36:31,149
but I've lost her.

1888
01:36:31,149 --> 01:36:34,930
It's been so long now.

1889
01:36:34,930 --> 01:36:37,399
Oh, did you know one of the girls

1890
01:36:37,399 --> 01:36:48,640
who went missing around here, ma'am?

1891
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:53,729
Oh, and by the way, let me just make this really clear.

1892
01:36:53,729 --> 01:36:56,430
It's 2022.

1893
01:36:56,430 --> 01:37:00,250
If you've consumed pornographic material,

1894
01:37:00,250 --> 01:37:02,930
this isn't like 1902 where it's like,

1895
01:37:02,930 --> 01:37:06,250
oh no, nobody's consumed, how dare you, the devil.

1896
01:37:06,250 --> 01:37:08,770
Now, who really gives a shit?

1897
01:37:08,770 --> 01:37:10,210
Who really gives a shit?

1898
01:37:10,210 --> 01:37:14,600
If you watch porn movies in the hotel room,

1899
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:16,880
I don't care.

1900
01:37:18,510 --> 01:37:24,899
Who cares?

1901
01:37:24,899 --> 01:37:26,539
I don't give a shit if you're watching porn

1902
01:37:26,539 --> 01:37:28,659
in your hotel room, but what the fuck do I care?

1903
01:37:28,659 --> 01:37:30,060
It has nothing to do with me.

1904
01:37:36,149 --> 01:37:45,409
I'm glad that got sniped, and I'm glad it did.

1905
01:37:45,409 --> 01:38:09,489
My fingers are so, ugh.

1906
01:38:09,489 --> 01:38:20,989
I'm going to take it off of emote-only mode in 10 seconds.

1907
01:38:20,989 --> 01:38:27,729
I want strict behavior.

1908
01:38:27,729 --> 01:38:28,970
Doing a late night walk.

1909
01:38:28,970 --> 01:38:29,810
First one.

1910
01:38:29,810 --> 01:38:31,130
That's girl, but what?

1911
01:38:31,130 --> 01:38:31,970
I don't know if-

1912
01:38:31,970 --> 01:38:34,159
Okay, we want behavior.

1913
01:38:34,159 --> 01:38:37,479
I want you on your best behavior.

1914
01:38:37,479 --> 01:38:39,039
There could be a sponsor watching.

1915
01:38:39,039 --> 01:38:40,159
You never know.

1916
01:38:40,159 --> 01:38:42,439
There could be a sponsor watching.

1917
01:38:42,439 --> 01:38:46,840
How would you, there could be somebody from, I don't know.

1918
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:49,189
You never know, I gotta be careful.

1919
01:38:49,189 --> 01:38:51,819
We'll talk about that anymore.

1920
01:38:51,819 --> 01:38:56,369
All right, so is my clothes done?

1921
01:38:56,369 --> 01:38:59,750
I just keep getting derailed.

1922
01:38:59,750 --> 01:39:02,069
I think this game is like a 40 minute experience,

1923
01:39:02,069 --> 01:39:08,420
and I just keep getting so derailed.

1924
01:39:08,420 --> 01:39:10,619
What about the, maybe P-Paw?

1925
01:39:10,619 --> 01:39:26,630
Yeah, I'll go talk to P-Paw.

1926
01:39:26,630 --> 01:39:30,000
Old Louis was a real son of a bitch.

1927
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:33,439
Had a real eye for the younger girls he did.

1928
01:39:33,439 --> 01:39:37,000
Don't mean to gossip, but I have it on good authority.

1929
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:40,199
He was the one who knocked up that poor girl

1930
01:39:40,199 --> 01:39:41,840
who worked for him.

1931
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:43,640
Can't remember her name,

1932
01:39:44,199 --> 01:39:46,520
but between that scandal, the fire,

1933
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:48,960
and then the disappearances,

1934
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:52,159
I would say all the details will never be known.

1935
01:39:54,170 --> 01:40:08,899
Okay, I don't know why.

1936
01:40:08,899 --> 01:40:11,399
I just thought it would be like kind of funny.

1937
01:40:11,399 --> 01:40:14,609
Remember Supermarket Sweep?

1938
01:40:14,609 --> 01:40:17,010
Imagine they did like a supermarket sweep type thing

1939
01:40:17,010 --> 01:40:19,029
with like a video store.

1940
01:40:19,029 --> 01:40:21,909
And it was the person, the contestant got to the end.

1941
01:40:21,909 --> 01:40:23,510
It was like, okay, you gotta go through each aisle

1942
01:40:23,510 --> 01:40:27,159
and you gotta get as many DVDs as you want.

1943
01:40:27,159 --> 01:40:29,439
Any shelf, anything that you care about, right?

1944
01:40:29,439 --> 01:40:30,399
And the music starts and it's like,

1945
01:40:30,399 --> 01:40:31,600
all right, let's go.

1946
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:35,640
They fucking sprint into this room

1947
01:40:35,640 --> 01:40:38,460
and just start sliding their hand into the cart.

1948
01:40:38,460 --> 01:40:40,260
Just filling it with all these porns.

1949
01:40:40,260 --> 01:40:42,369
And they don't even touch anything else.

1950
01:40:42,369 --> 01:40:44,050
And after five straight minutes, they come out of here

1951
01:40:44,050 --> 01:40:48,039
with like a cart full of just porn DVDs.

1952
01:40:48,039 --> 01:40:48,880
And everyone just sitting there like,

1953
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:51,659
what the fuck?

1954
01:40:51,659 --> 01:40:52,939
Don't go in there.

1955
01:40:52,939 --> 01:40:54,670
I, whatever.

1956
01:40:54,670 --> 01:40:58,149
He looks like a shrimp.

1957
01:40:58,149 --> 01:40:58,970
Me?

1958
01:40:58,970 --> 01:41:03,670
Like, wait, the animal, the shrimp.

1959
01:41:03,670 --> 01:41:08,560
What does the shrimp's face look like?

1960
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:15,359
There's blood on this?

1961
01:41:15,359 --> 01:41:16,520
Gross, okay.

1962
01:41:32,109 --> 01:41:35,869
Can I just read you a portion of my modding chat?

1963
01:41:37,630 --> 01:41:38,989
This is from VR Josh.

1964
01:41:38,989 --> 01:41:41,840
This is very important.

1965
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:42,680
Thumbs up.

1966
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:45,539
Emote only mode enabled.

1967
01:41:45,539 --> 01:41:47,439
I'm not gonna read that one, next one.

1968
01:41:47,439 --> 01:41:48,680
I'm ready, LOL.

1969
01:41:48,680 --> 01:41:50,439
Okay, emote only coming off.

1970
01:41:50,439 --> 01:41:52,949
I'm gonna block the word porn.

1971
01:41:52,949 --> 01:41:58,250
Nevermind.

1972
01:41:58,250 --> 01:41:59,819
They're trying.

1973
01:41:59,819 --> 01:42:01,640
They're trying, guys.

1974
01:42:01,640 --> 01:42:03,800
They're trying.

1975
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:05,479
Did I already show this?

1976
01:42:05,479 --> 01:42:06,479
Did I already show you this?

1977
01:42:06,479 --> 01:42:13,600
That is, but he sounds like a real asshole to me.

1978
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:20,050
Okay.

1979
01:42:20,050 --> 01:42:21,210
I think that's pretty much it.

1980
01:42:21,210 --> 01:42:25,569
There's nobody else to talk to, right?

1981
01:42:25,569 --> 01:42:27,300
Is there another store over here?

1982
01:42:27,300 --> 01:42:32,270
What is the car that was in front of the bus stop?

1983
01:42:32,270 --> 01:42:41,069
Yeah, that's the bus stop car.

1984
01:42:41,069 --> 01:42:44,390
Do I look like a shrimp?

1985
01:42:44,390 --> 01:42:47,770
Let me see.

1986
01:42:47,770 --> 01:42:49,239
What does a shrimp look like?

1987
01:42:49,239 --> 01:42:52,729
I know what they look like, but do I look a little bit?

1988
01:42:52,729 --> 01:42:54,920
What animal do I look like?

1989
01:42:54,920 --> 01:42:56,949
All right, mods, run a poll.

1990
01:42:56,949 --> 01:42:57,789
I want you to run a poll

1991
01:42:57,789 --> 01:43:03,119
and I want you to put 10 of sort of the most iconic animals.

1992
01:43:03,159 --> 01:43:04,119
I don't want people to vote

1993
01:43:04,119 --> 01:43:12,630
on what animal they think I look like.

1994
01:43:18,239 --> 01:43:20,800
I need a code for that lock box.

1995
01:43:33,850 --> 01:43:35,050
Can I break this?

1996
01:43:35,050 --> 01:43:39,439
What do I do with this doll head?

1997
01:43:39,439 --> 01:43:42,199
Polls only have five options.

1998
01:43:42,199 --> 01:43:52,829
Oh, nevermind.

1999
01:43:52,829 --> 01:43:54,270
So what do I do?

2000
01:43:54,270 --> 01:43:58,869
Is my clothes not done drying yet?

2001
01:43:58,869 --> 01:44:02,909
Maybe they are.

2002
01:44:02,909 --> 01:44:05,819
No, they're not done.

2003
01:44:05,819 --> 01:44:06,760
Oh, there it is.

2004
01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:07,939
What the hell?

2005
01:44:07,939 --> 01:44:09,720
These clothes are still wet.

2006
01:44:09,720 --> 01:44:10,840
This machine must be broken,

2007
01:44:10,840 --> 01:44:12,960
but those were my last quarters.

2008
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:17,250
Where's that employee?

2009
01:44:18,090 --> 01:44:21,479
Excuse me.

2010
01:44:21,479 --> 01:44:27,130
Excuse me.

2011
01:44:27,130 --> 01:44:29,949
Where are you?

2012
01:44:29,949 --> 01:44:34,020
Hello?

2013
01:44:34,020 --> 01:44:35,340
Get up.

2014
01:44:35,340 --> 01:44:44,560
There's blood.

2015
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:45,960
What are you doing in here?

2016
01:44:45,960 --> 01:44:47,079
Doing a late night wash.

2017
01:44:47,079 --> 01:44:47,920
Yeah.

2018
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:48,760
First one.

2019
01:44:48,760 --> 01:44:49,579
That's girl.

2020
01:44:49,579 --> 01:44:50,420
But what?

2021
01:44:50,420 --> 01:44:54,130
I heard.

2022
01:44:54,130 --> 01:44:54,949
Well.

2023
01:44:54,949 --> 01:44:56,729
What do you have to say about this?

2024
01:44:56,729 --> 01:45:01,159
Not my kind of doll, if you know what I mean.

2025
01:45:01,159 --> 01:45:02,600
You read these?

2026
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:03,640
I don't need to ask him about this.

2027
01:45:03,640 --> 01:45:05,069
Okay.

2028
01:45:05,069 --> 01:45:16,000
So what's going on?

2029
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:17,600
What?

2030
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:20,319
Oh, it's the employee.

2031
01:45:20,319 --> 01:45:22,960
He's been ripped to shreds.

2032
01:45:22,960 --> 01:45:38,399
I need to call the police.

2033
01:45:38,399 --> 01:45:47,659
Shit.

2034
01:45:47,659 --> 01:45:51,710
You watched porn at the Holiday Inn and got caught.

2035
01:45:51,710 --> 01:45:57,090
That's very specific.

2036
01:45:57,090 --> 01:45:59,710
Why are you still on that?

2037
01:45:59,710 --> 01:46:00,550
Hello?

2038
01:46:00,550 --> 01:46:01,989
Somebody just fell from the ceiling.

2039
01:46:01,989 --> 01:46:02,829
You need to send someone now.

2040
01:46:02,829 --> 01:46:03,649
I'm at the...

2041
01:46:03,649 --> 01:46:05,430
Somebody fell from the ceiling covered in blood

2042
01:46:05,430 --> 01:46:07,170
and they were like ripped up.

2043
01:46:07,170 --> 01:46:09,949
And you're still on the dude you got caught

2044
01:46:09,949 --> 01:46:13,880
at the Holiday Inn back a year or two ago or something.

2045
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:20,420
We're trying to play a game.

2046
01:46:20,420 --> 01:46:22,300
Shit.

2047
01:46:22,300 --> 01:46:23,560
20 minutes later.

2048
01:46:26,270 --> 01:46:29,750
20 minutes later.

2049
01:46:29,750 --> 01:46:33,529
Dispatch said they got a call coming from out here,

2050
01:46:33,529 --> 01:46:37,289
but it's strange.

2051
01:46:37,289 --> 01:46:39,770
Don't give them specific timeframes.

2052
01:46:39,770 --> 01:46:42,689
I'm just, I'm getting in their mindset.

2053
01:46:42,689 --> 01:46:47,130
I can't seem to be able to find anyone.

2054
01:46:47,130 --> 01:46:50,729
Where is this person talking?

2055
01:46:50,729 --> 01:46:51,729
There's no body in here?

2056
01:46:51,729 --> 01:46:58,000
What?

2057
01:46:58,000 --> 01:46:58,819
They don't know.

2058
01:46:58,819 --> 01:46:59,960
What do you mean?

2059
01:46:59,960 --> 01:47:02,649
I'd be a rodent.

2060
01:47:02,649 --> 01:47:05,279
I don't know if I'd be a rodent.

2061
01:47:05,279 --> 01:47:10,470
I think I'm more of a lion.

2062
01:47:10,470 --> 01:47:14,649
Is that someone crying?

2063
01:47:14,649 --> 01:47:16,569
It sounds like it's coming from that office

2064
01:47:16,569 --> 01:47:22,939
by the pizza place.

2065
01:47:22,939 --> 01:47:24,979
Well, you're a police officer.

2066
01:47:24,979 --> 01:47:31,819
Go look.

2067
01:47:31,819 --> 01:47:32,659
I hate this.

2068
01:47:32,659 --> 01:47:33,720
I hate this.

2069
01:47:33,720 --> 01:47:35,180
Go look in there.

2070
01:47:35,180 --> 01:47:38,520
Go look in there.

2071
01:47:38,520 --> 01:47:42,319
All I have is I have a key for a weapon.

2072
01:47:42,319 --> 01:47:43,439
I'm the police officer.

2073
01:47:43,439 --> 01:47:46,859
What are you?

2074
01:47:46,859 --> 01:47:49,689
Oh, I'm the officer.

2075
01:47:49,689 --> 01:47:56,500
Oh.

2076
01:47:56,500 --> 01:48:07,640
The office by the pizza place?

2077
01:48:07,640 --> 01:48:12,340
Oh, it's just somebody that has to do the taxes.

2078
01:48:12,340 --> 01:48:26,979
Yeah, I get upset every fucking April 10th as well.

2079
01:48:26,979 --> 01:48:29,260
Is anyone there?

2080
01:48:29,260 --> 01:48:30,539
That was a boomer joke.

2081
01:48:30,539 --> 01:48:31,380
That's fine.

2082
01:48:31,380 --> 01:48:33,029
This is the police.

2083
01:48:33,029 --> 01:48:37,600
If anyone is there, then come out now.

2084
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:41,189
There's something wrong here.

2085
01:48:41,189 --> 01:48:45,760
Investigate thoroughly.

2086
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:52,239
Oh, God.

2087
01:48:52,239 --> 01:49:03,859
Business plan, computer, doesn't look suspicious.

2088
01:49:03,859 --> 01:49:12,659
Binders, copy machine, water cooler.

2089
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:17,880
The TV got worse.

2090
01:49:17,880 --> 01:49:26,470
It's hard to see.

2091
01:49:26,470 --> 01:49:30,710
Fuck off.

2092
01:49:30,710 --> 01:49:32,390
If you, I found if you sniff in,

2093
01:49:32,390 --> 01:49:33,750
when you think a jump scare is gonna happen,

2094
01:49:33,750 --> 01:49:55,619
it scares you less.

2095
01:49:55,619 --> 01:49:56,460
Yeah.

2096
01:49:56,460 --> 01:49:57,279
Yeah.

2097
01:49:57,279 --> 01:49:58,119
Yeah.

2098
01:49:58,119 --> 01:49:59,329
Yeah.

2099
01:49:59,329 --> 01:50:01,220
Yeah.

2100
01:50:01,220 --> 01:50:05,180
Yeah.

2101
01:50:05,180 --> 01:50:06,020
Yeah.

2102
01:50:06,020 --> 01:50:06,840
Yeah.

2103
01:50:06,840 --> 01:50:07,680
Yeah.

2104
01:50:07,680 --> 01:50:08,520
Yeah.

2105
01:50:08,520 --> 01:50:09,340
Yeah.

2106
01:50:09,340 --> 01:50:10,180
Yeah.

2107
01:50:10,180 --> 01:50:11,020
Yeah.

2108
01:50:11,020 --> 01:50:11,840
Yeah.

2109
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:12,680
Yeah.

2110
01:50:12,680 --> 01:50:13,520
Yeah.

2111
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:14,899
Yeah.

2112
01:50:14,899 --> 01:50:15,739
Yeah.

2113
01:50:15,739 --> 01:50:16,579
Yeah.

2114
01:50:16,579 --> 01:50:17,399
Yeah.

2115
01:50:17,399 --> 01:50:18,239
Yeah.

2116
01:50:18,239 --> 01:50:19,079
Yeah.

2117
01:50:19,079 --> 01:50:19,899
Yeah.

2118
01:50:19,899 --> 01:50:23,479
How many bolts do I have?

2119
01:50:23,479 --> 01:50:24,319
An infinite amount.

2120
01:50:24,319 --> 01:50:38,050
Good.

2121
01:50:38,050 --> 01:50:54,039
Office key.

2122
01:50:54,039 --> 01:50:54,880
That's so bad.

2123
01:50:54,880 --> 01:51:08,260
I wanna press G and throw a grenade down the hall.

2124
01:51:08,260 --> 01:51:09,100
Get the key.

2125
01:51:09,100 --> 01:51:09,939
Get the key.

2126
01:51:09,939 --> 01:51:11,829
Get the key out, man.

2127
01:51:12,470 --> 01:51:13,310
Where's my key?

2128
01:51:13,310 --> 01:51:15,159
I got an office key.

2129
01:51:15,159 --> 01:51:16,000
Officer.

2130
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:17,840
Oh, that's an office, Burton.

2131
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:18,760
Burton's office.

2132
01:51:18,760 --> 01:51:19,600
Locked.

2133
01:51:19,600 --> 01:51:20,420
I can find a key.

2134
01:51:20,420 --> 01:51:22,199
What is this?

2135
01:51:22,199 --> 01:51:34,220
Is that where I can't, how do I get it?

2136
01:51:34,220 --> 01:51:39,010
The door is stuck.

2137
01:51:39,010 --> 01:51:40,090
Why do I get my key out?

2138
01:51:40,090 --> 01:51:44,380
Turn on a flashlight?

2139
01:51:44,380 --> 01:51:46,300
What do you mean turn?

2140
01:51:46,300 --> 01:51:47,979
I don't, I need, where's my key?

2141
01:51:47,979 --> 01:51:50,340
I just picked one up.

2142
01:51:50,340 --> 01:51:51,180
Door is stuck.

2143
01:51:51,180 --> 01:51:52,000
Door is stuck.

2144
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,229
Door is stuck.

2145
01:51:54,229 --> 01:51:57,649
But I got a key to the office, didn't I?

2146
01:51:57,649 --> 01:52:01,159
Locked.

2147
01:52:01,159 --> 01:52:02,500
It's tab, isn't it?

2148
01:52:02,500 --> 01:52:13,810
There's no scroll.

2149
01:52:13,810 --> 01:52:14,649
Where do I get it?

2150
01:52:14,649 --> 01:52:20,539
Press I.

2151
01:52:20,539 --> 01:52:23,840
I picked it up, didn't I?

2152
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:24,680
I don't get it.

2153
01:52:24,680 --> 01:52:25,520
Yeah, I have it.

2154
01:52:28,630 --> 01:52:29,470
What is it?

2155
01:52:29,470 --> 01:52:37,189
Look at the fire extinguisher.

2156
01:52:37,189 --> 01:52:38,029
Where, I don't get it.

2157
01:52:38,029 --> 01:52:40,670
Press one, two, three, four.

2158
01:52:40,670 --> 01:52:41,590
Press the key button.

2159
01:52:41,590 --> 01:52:47,170
Usually I just hit tab and I have an inventory.

2160
01:52:47,170 --> 01:52:49,829
I don't understand what's happening here.

2161
01:52:49,829 --> 01:52:50,670
It's one.

2162
01:52:50,670 --> 01:52:58,859
It's not one.

2163
01:52:58,859 --> 01:53:01,189
It even says I need a key.

2164
01:53:01,189 --> 01:53:02,289
Is it bugged?

2165
01:53:02,289 --> 01:53:06,140
Right click.

2166
01:53:06,140 --> 01:53:06,979
Locked.

2167
01:53:06,979 --> 01:53:07,819
What the fuck?

2168
01:53:07,819 --> 01:53:09,220
Scroll with the gun out.

2169
01:53:09,220 --> 01:53:37,289
Oh, come on, Gwyn.

2170
01:53:37,289 --> 01:53:53,090
What?

2171
01:53:53,090 --> 01:53:53,930
Oh my God.

2172
01:53:53,930 --> 01:53:54,770
You gotta help me.

2173
01:53:54,770 --> 01:53:55,590
Slow down.

2174
01:53:55,590 --> 01:53:56,430
It's okay.

2175
01:53:56,430 --> 01:54:07,659
Just follow me.

2176
01:54:07,659 --> 01:54:08,619
Fire!

2177
01:54:08,619 --> 01:54:12,130
Fire!

2178
01:54:12,130 --> 01:54:14,680
Fire!

2179
01:54:14,680 --> 01:54:15,640
What happened?

2180
01:54:17,640 --> 01:54:18,479
What?

2181
01:54:18,479 --> 01:54:19,810
Okay, go.

2182
01:54:19,810 --> 01:54:26,510
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

2183
01:54:26,510 --> 01:54:27,390
I didn't mean to do that.

2184
01:54:27,390 --> 01:54:35,470
I'm too jumpy today.

2185
01:54:35,470 --> 01:54:37,760
I wanna say at this point, I don't give a shit.

2186
01:54:37,760 --> 01:54:39,319
I'm gonna turn the corner and...

2187
01:54:39,319 --> 01:54:40,159
Yeah.

2188
01:54:40,159 --> 01:54:43,100
Yeah.

2189
01:54:43,100 --> 01:54:43,920
I don't care.

2190
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:44,760
I'm gonna turn the corner.

2191
01:54:44,760 --> 01:54:45,600
Someone's gonna go, wait!

2192
01:54:45,600 --> 01:54:47,949
And I'm gonna...

2193
01:54:47,949 --> 01:54:48,789
You know what I mean?

2194
01:54:48,789 --> 01:54:58,300
In those old like shooter games.

2195
01:54:58,300 --> 01:55:25,680
What are you talking about?

2196
01:55:25,680 --> 01:55:26,520
I didn't get them.

2197
01:55:26,520 --> 01:55:28,859
I was shooting every two steps.

2198
01:55:28,859 --> 01:55:33,640
And the one step that I don't shoot, I get killed.

2199
01:55:33,640 --> 01:55:35,270
No one's coming.

2200
01:55:35,270 --> 01:55:36,630
Maybe I can make a run for it.

2201
01:55:53,779 --> 01:56:11,680
Fucking smashing.

2202
01:56:11,680 --> 01:56:26,239
In that receipt.

2203
01:56:26,239 --> 01:56:28,979
It's a receipt for a building repair company.

2204
01:56:28,979 --> 01:56:30,920
Looks like they had to repair one of the walls in the...

2205
01:56:30,920 --> 01:56:33,520
Oh.

2206
01:56:33,520 --> 01:56:36,010
Okay.

2207
01:56:36,010 --> 01:56:38,869
I can smash the wall with a hammer.

2208
01:56:38,869 --> 01:56:39,710
Without a doubt.

2209
01:56:43,659 --> 01:56:51,279
God damn it.

2210
01:56:51,279 --> 01:56:54,399
My clothes done.

2211
01:56:54,399 --> 01:57:11,270
What the fuck are you doing?

2212
01:57:11,270 --> 01:57:13,479
What?

2213
01:57:14,619 --> 01:57:15,460
What?

2214
01:57:15,460 --> 01:57:23,199
Cradle at baby is drowsing.

2215
01:57:23,359 --> 01:57:24,840
Who is doing that?

2216
01:57:24,840 --> 01:57:29,689
Are they in the washing machine?

2217
01:57:30,569 --> 01:57:31,409
Discord Mike?

2218
01:57:35,140 --> 01:57:35,979
I don't know.

2219
01:57:35,979 --> 01:57:37,939
We're just gonna get out of here quick.

2220
01:57:37,939 --> 01:57:40,670
There's a door behind here.

2221
01:57:40,670 --> 01:57:58,189
Get out, get out, get out, get out.

2222
01:57:58,189 --> 01:57:59,029
Grenade.

2223
01:57:59,029 --> 01:58:05,529
No.

2224
01:58:05,529 --> 01:58:10,640
Do I hide?

2225
01:58:10,640 --> 01:58:11,479
Do I, where do I go?

2226
01:58:11,479 --> 01:58:12,300
Do I hide in here?

2227
01:58:12,300 --> 01:58:14,340
An event?

2228
01:58:14,340 --> 01:58:29,739
Leave.

2229
01:58:29,739 --> 01:58:30,579
No!

2230
01:58:33,789 --> 01:58:39,779
Fuck you.

2231
01:58:39,779 --> 01:58:42,579
Newspaper.

2232
01:58:42,579 --> 01:58:47,329
Main suspect in police investigation disappears.

2233
01:58:47,329 --> 01:58:49,689
45 year old Lewis Kennedy has gone missing.

2234
01:58:49,689 --> 01:58:51,489
The top suspect in the grisly crime

2235
01:58:51,489 --> 01:58:54,310
of an arson alleged kidnapping.

2236
01:58:54,310 --> 01:58:56,310
What the fuck?

2237
01:58:56,350 --> 01:58:58,029
Sources say that Kennedy had been under surveillance

2238
01:58:58,029 --> 01:58:59,750
for a few weeks and at some point of the course

2239
01:58:59,750 --> 01:59:02,649
of last night had broken contact with officers.

2240
01:59:02,649 --> 01:59:09,189
That was a centipede scream?

2241
01:59:09,189 --> 01:59:11,189
The audio did something really weird to your voice.

2242
01:59:11,189 --> 01:59:14,439
Can I hear, let me hear it.

2243
01:59:14,439 --> 01:59:17,680
Take less cocaine next time.

2244
01:59:17,680 --> 01:59:21,750
Let me hear this.

2245
01:59:21,750 --> 01:59:27,960
Let me see, I need to know what this sounds like.

2246
01:59:27,960 --> 01:59:32,720
How bad does it sound?

2247
01:59:36,390 --> 01:59:43,760
That's so weird.

2248
01:59:43,760 --> 01:59:46,800
Fuck, it sounds like it's in a different room.

2249
01:59:46,800 --> 01:59:48,159
So what doesn't sound like that right now?

2250
01:59:48,159 --> 01:59:52,420
It's only when I get loud?

2251
01:59:52,420 --> 01:59:53,659
It sounds like I have like,

2252
01:59:53,659 --> 01:59:57,779
it sounds like I'm yelling into my hands.

2253
01:59:57,779 --> 02:00:03,279
It doesn't sound like that right now, right?

2254
02:00:03,279 --> 02:00:12,010
It sounds like a Diablo II death sound.

2255
02:00:12,010 --> 02:00:13,010
It really does.

2256
02:00:29,720 --> 02:00:36,569
It sounds like a fucking Diablo II death.

2257
02:00:36,569 --> 02:00:39,369
But what's missing is me slamming the desk

2258
02:00:39,369 --> 02:00:43,550
and going, what the fuck, dude?

2259
02:00:43,550 --> 02:00:44,789
It's trying to filter out anything

2260
02:00:44,789 --> 02:00:51,000
that it's a noise that humans don't normally make.

2261
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:52,560
I don't know, I try to fix it,

2262
02:00:52,560 --> 02:00:59,880
but I don't know what the fuck is going on there, man.

2263
02:00:59,880 --> 02:01:02,180
That's so fucking dumb.

2264
02:01:02,180 --> 02:01:08,189
Sounds like an old Mortal Kombat attack.

2265
02:01:08,189 --> 02:01:14,819
It does, it really does.

2266
02:01:14,819 --> 02:01:18,550
Like Mortal Kombat on the Sega Genesis.

2267
02:01:18,550 --> 02:01:36,680
Okay, okay, I'm gonna fucking freak out.

2268
02:01:36,680 --> 02:01:39,960
AC unit, it won't open.

2269
02:01:39,960 --> 02:01:48,340
Flashlight, how do I turn it on?

2270
02:01:48,340 --> 02:01:57,600
F for flashlight?

2271
02:01:59,600 --> 02:02:01,800
Oh, hey, fuck, hey, I don't wanna look this way.

2272
02:02:01,800 --> 02:02:04,939
I wanna run away.

2273
02:02:04,939 --> 02:02:06,939
It won't budge, what do you mean it won't budge?

2274
02:02:06,939 --> 02:02:09,260
Hide somewhere, hide in the filing cabinet or something.

2275
02:02:09,260 --> 02:02:11,130
Hide in the filing cabinet.

2276
02:02:11,130 --> 02:02:12,449
Hide over here.

2277
02:02:12,449 --> 02:02:15,069
Go this way, turn on the flashlight.

2278
02:02:16,510 --> 02:02:17,520
Yikes.

2279
02:02:18,439 --> 02:02:24,039
Oh, like, oh, no.

2280
02:02:24,039 --> 02:02:26,199
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

2281
02:02:26,199 --> 02:02:42,609
Whoa, whoa, whoa, a scalpel.

2282
02:02:42,609 --> 02:02:43,970
I thought that was my face.

2283
02:02:43,970 --> 02:02:47,529
I thought that was an emote of my face.

2284
02:02:47,529 --> 02:02:52,619
I know I won't be getting out of here alive.

2285
02:02:52,619 --> 02:02:55,659
That psychopath, it kills women like me.

2286
02:02:55,659 --> 02:02:59,359
I've heard at least three of those brought here and killed.

2287
02:02:59,359 --> 02:03:00,439
Peeking through the cracks I saw

2288
02:03:00,439 --> 02:03:04,000
that it creates these masks out of skin.

2289
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:07,300
Whoa, I don't know what kind of game it's wanting to play.

2290
02:03:07,300 --> 02:03:08,939
I think my time is up.

2291
02:03:08,939 --> 02:03:10,220
It made me swallow a key,

2292
02:03:10,220 --> 02:03:12,100
a key that I think would get me out of here,

2293
02:03:12,100 --> 02:03:13,739
but I have a feeling it won't let me live long enough

2294
02:03:13,739 --> 02:03:14,739
to use it.

2295
02:03:14,739 --> 02:03:27,130
I'll be struggling butchered like the rest.

2296
02:03:27,130 --> 02:03:31,840
Ah, where are you?

2297
02:03:31,840 --> 02:03:33,359
I know that this is this person over here.

2298
02:03:33,359 --> 02:03:36,039
This is gonna burn me.

2299
02:03:36,039 --> 02:03:42,590
Yeah, you, I got a scalpel and I got, there's a key.

2300
02:03:42,590 --> 02:03:43,630
I can't believe I'm doing this.

2301
02:03:43,630 --> 02:03:46,039
I got a key to get out of here.

2302
02:03:46,039 --> 02:03:47,399
All right, all right, all right, all right.

2303
02:03:47,399 --> 02:03:48,239
Give me that key.

2304
02:03:48,239 --> 02:03:50,199
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right.

2305
02:03:50,199 --> 02:03:56,630
Just, I'm gonna hold this out and run.

2306
02:03:56,630 --> 02:03:57,670
Oh, he's gonna be in this door.

2307
02:03:57,670 --> 02:03:58,550
He's gonna break through this door.

2308
02:03:58,550 --> 02:03:59,390
I know it.

2309
02:03:59,390 --> 02:04:00,229
He's gonna break through the door.

2310
02:04:00,229 --> 02:04:04,880
He's gonna, he's gonna break out the door.

2311
02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:23,039
Wrong key.

2312
02:04:23,039 --> 02:04:30,470
Is that, who's that?

2313
02:04:30,470 --> 02:04:32,250
Corpse.

2314
02:04:32,250 --> 02:04:35,640
Corpse, been here for years.

2315
02:04:35,640 --> 02:04:38,399
There's a wallet sticking out of his pocket.

2316
02:04:38,399 --> 02:04:39,239
Who is it?

2317
02:04:39,239 --> 02:04:40,510
What?

2318
02:04:40,510 --> 02:04:43,140
The driver's license belongs to Lewis Kennedy.

2319
02:04:43,140 --> 02:04:45,260
This doesn't make any sense.

2320
02:04:45,260 --> 02:04:50,770
I need to get out of here and call the police.

2321
02:04:50,770 --> 02:04:52,310
There's a, what?

2322
02:04:52,310 --> 02:04:53,600
There's a, what?

2323
02:04:53,600 --> 02:04:55,800
No, I don't wanna get out of here.

2324
02:04:55,800 --> 02:05:10,800
How do I get out of here?

2325
02:05:10,800 --> 02:05:23,720
Oh, oh, person, Scoob.

2326
02:05:24,239 --> 02:05:27,159
Rocky, we need to get out of here.

2327
02:05:27,159 --> 02:05:28,800
Like, I agree, Scoob.

2328
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:30,199
Let's skedaddle.

2329
02:05:33,420 --> 02:05:45,260
Rocky, we need to get out of here.

2330
02:05:45,260 --> 02:05:55,029
Find the child.

2331
02:05:55,029 --> 02:05:58,619
Oh, by the way, speaking of those two,

2332
02:05:58,619 --> 02:06:03,479
I have access to the Multiversus Early Alpha.

2333
02:06:03,479 --> 02:06:06,550
I was thinking about playing it on stream at some point.

2334
02:06:06,550 --> 02:06:07,590
Just letting you know.

2335
02:06:07,590 --> 02:06:12,119
I have access to it and that could be pretty fun

2336
02:06:12,119 --> 02:06:16,520
if we were to do it eventually.

2337
02:06:16,520 --> 02:06:19,939
Can I go through here?

2338
02:06:19,939 --> 02:06:29,149
I need to get this lock off.

2339
02:06:29,189 --> 02:06:30,029
What was that?

2340
02:06:30,029 --> 02:06:31,029
I don't know.

2341
02:06:31,029 --> 02:06:32,189
I don't know, I don't know.

2342
02:06:32,189 --> 02:06:35,930
I don't know what it is.

2343
02:06:35,930 --> 02:06:40,239
I don't know.

2344
02:06:40,239 --> 02:06:45,869
I don't know.

2345
02:06:45,869 --> 02:07:04,550
I don't know.

2346
02:07:04,550 --> 02:07:13,609
What was that?

2347
02:07:13,609 --> 02:07:16,859
Ammo.

2348
02:07:16,859 --> 02:07:18,779
I have ammo?

2349
02:07:18,779 --> 02:07:19,960
Okay, I've got ammo.

2350
02:07:19,960 --> 02:07:31,029
I don't know.

2351
02:07:31,029 --> 02:07:40,810
You're gonna be right here, aren't you?

2352
02:07:40,810 --> 02:07:57,510
Wait!

2353
02:07:57,510 --> 02:08:05,220
Gun.

2354
02:08:05,220 --> 02:08:07,239
How many bullets does this have?

2355
02:08:07,239 --> 02:08:09,710
I'm afraid to shoot it.

2356
02:08:09,710 --> 02:08:13,899
How do I turn the flashlight on?

2357
02:08:13,899 --> 02:08:22,659
It's so hard to see.

2358
02:08:22,659 --> 02:08:24,460
Oh, there's so many warships.

2359
02:08:24,460 --> 02:08:29,119
Gosh, there's so many washing machines down here, Mickey.

2360
02:08:29,119 --> 02:08:30,720
Of course there is, Goofy.

2361
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:46,210
That's where they do their laundry.

2362
02:08:46,210 --> 02:08:48,829
That was a bad bit.

2363
02:08:48,829 --> 02:08:56,109
I'm not doing a bit.

2364
02:08:56,109 --> 02:08:57,829
Come out, you asshole.

2365
02:08:57,829 --> 02:09:03,000
I'm ready for you.

2366
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:04,930
Why would you do that?

2367
02:09:04,930 --> 02:09:06,369
Don't say that.

2368
02:09:06,369 --> 02:09:07,770
You need to...

2369
02:09:07,770 --> 02:09:08,729
Actually, you know what?

2370
02:09:08,729 --> 02:09:11,109
This is what I'd do.

2371
02:09:11,109 --> 02:09:14,130
I'd say, like, come get me, motherfucker.

2372
02:09:14,130 --> 02:09:15,409
Like, I'm here, I'm waiting for you.

2373
02:09:15,409 --> 02:09:17,449
And then I would throw something over there

2374
02:09:17,449 --> 02:09:20,289
and be like, ow, my knee, ow!

2375
02:09:20,289 --> 02:09:22,260
I'd be like, ow, my knee!

2376
02:09:22,260 --> 02:09:23,100
And then they'd think, holy shit,

2377
02:09:23,100 --> 02:09:26,100
he must have fallen down and gotten hit.

2378
02:09:26,100 --> 02:09:32,350
And then he'd go on over there.

2379
02:09:32,350 --> 02:09:56,350
There's a person right there.

2380
02:09:56,350 --> 02:09:57,189
Oh!

2381
02:09:57,189 --> 02:10:00,319
Oh!

2382
02:10:00,319 --> 02:10:02,140
Oh!

2383
02:10:02,140 --> 02:10:08,920
Oh!

2384
02:10:08,920 --> 02:10:09,760
Where's my flashlight?

2385
02:10:09,760 --> 02:10:15,699
Oh my God, I can't see anything.

2386
02:10:15,739 --> 02:10:34,159
Oh my God, I can't see.

2387
02:10:34,159 --> 02:10:40,319
Whoa!

2388
02:10:40,319 --> 02:10:45,800
That was like, that sounds like my mic.

2389
02:10:45,800 --> 02:10:49,670
Why can't I move?

2390
02:10:49,670 --> 02:10:50,989
All right, I'm just gonna...

2391
02:10:50,989 --> 02:10:54,569
What the...

2392
02:10:54,569 --> 02:10:55,390
Oh!

2393
02:10:55,390 --> 02:11:02,159
Oh!

2394
02:11:02,159 --> 02:11:03,000
Oh!

2395
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:03,840
What the fuck, dude?

2396
02:11:03,840 --> 02:11:04,680
Oh!

2397
02:11:04,680 --> 02:11:06,920
Oh!

2398
02:11:06,920 --> 02:11:07,760
Oh!

2399
02:11:07,760 --> 02:11:14,600
Oh!

2400
02:11:14,600 --> 02:11:15,779
What's wrong with my mic?

2401
02:11:15,779 --> 02:11:16,659
What are you guys talking about?

2402
02:11:16,659 --> 02:11:18,159
Something wrong with my mic?

2403
02:11:18,159 --> 02:11:24,130
It's fucked up?

2404
02:11:24,130 --> 02:11:38,689
What's wrong?

2405
02:11:38,689 --> 02:11:39,529
What the fuck?

2406
02:11:39,529 --> 02:11:45,390
What the fuck?

2407
02:11:45,390 --> 02:11:46,229
This game's not even fucking scary.

2408
02:11:46,229 --> 02:11:51,600
It's fucking easy.

2409
02:11:51,600 --> 02:11:53,789
That'll make sense now.

2410
02:11:53,789 --> 02:12:00,380
Lewis Kennedy wasn't killing all those women.

2411
02:12:00,420 --> 02:12:01,539
You sound all muffled.

2412
02:12:01,539 --> 02:12:02,380
I don't know why.

2413
02:12:02,380 --> 02:12:04,850
I think the microphone is freaking out

2414
02:12:04,850 --> 02:12:06,800
when I hit a certain level,

2415
02:12:06,800 --> 02:12:09,609
because I sound completely normal right now.

2416
02:12:09,609 --> 02:12:12,479
But when I get to a certain audio level,

2417
02:12:12,479 --> 02:12:17,920
it just muffles me and puts a wall in front of my face.

2418
02:12:22,949 --> 02:12:24,590
The mic keeps freaking out.

2419
02:12:32,300 --> 02:12:33,140
Is it the noise gate?

2420
02:12:33,140 --> 02:12:34,539
I don't think it's on.

2421
02:12:42,119 --> 02:12:43,680
Your mic is trying to smother you

2422
02:12:43,680 --> 02:12:45,199
when you get really loud.

2423
02:12:45,199 --> 02:12:47,979
Scream loud right now.

2424
02:12:47,979 --> 02:12:50,479
Actually, let's find the level, right?

2425
02:12:50,479 --> 02:12:51,319
So like...

2426
02:12:56,329 --> 02:12:57,329
Were those all fine?

2427
02:12:59,359 --> 02:13:03,369
Were those fine?

2428
02:13:03,369 --> 02:13:04,710
Yeah.

2429
02:13:04,710 --> 02:13:06,170
Okay, so...

2430
02:13:09,210 --> 02:13:11,460
What happened?

2431
02:13:11,460 --> 02:13:17,020
What happened to the end there?

2432
02:13:17,020 --> 02:13:18,920
That was fine too.

2433
02:13:18,920 --> 02:13:24,140
Weird.

2434
02:13:24,140 --> 02:13:24,979
I don't know.

2435
02:13:24,979 --> 02:13:28,770
I have to mess with some of the settings.

2436
02:13:28,770 --> 02:13:32,409
She must have lost her baby though.

2437
02:13:32,409 --> 02:13:34,770
With almost being killed, losing her child,

2438
02:13:34,770 --> 02:13:37,470
and being terribly burned.

2439
02:13:37,470 --> 02:13:39,430
Completely snapped.

2440
02:13:39,430 --> 02:13:42,510
Maybe loud, quick loud sounds freak it out.

2441
02:13:44,880 --> 02:13:48,439
I think she has sudden loud sounds.

2442
02:13:48,439 --> 02:13:51,859
That's like half my fucking content.

2443
02:13:51,859 --> 02:13:54,100
She killed Louis,

2444
02:13:54,100 --> 02:13:57,520
and then set her sights on killing others

2445
02:13:57,520 --> 02:14:00,500
who had something she didn't.

2446
02:14:00,500 --> 02:14:14,640
God.

2447
02:14:14,640 --> 02:14:16,789
That was intense.

2448
02:14:16,789 --> 02:14:22,760
That was blood wash.

2449
02:14:22,760 --> 02:14:24,600
Isn't the barf drinker?

2450
02:14:24,600 --> 02:14:31,359
It does kind of look like the barf drinker.

2451
02:14:31,359 --> 02:14:33,640
It turns into a McDonald's mic.

2452
02:14:33,680 --> 02:14:34,680
Eventually, yeah.

2453
02:14:34,680 --> 02:14:37,949
It does.

2454
02:14:37,949 --> 02:14:38,789
That was pretty good.

2455
02:14:38,789 --> 02:14:39,630
That was good.

2456
02:14:39,630 --> 02:14:44,020
That was scary, interesting, creepy.

2457
02:14:44,020 --> 02:14:47,699
I thought that was cool.

2458
02:14:47,699 --> 02:14:49,819
Are you gonna play multiverses?

2459
02:14:49,819 --> 02:14:52,090
I mean, yeah.

2460
02:14:52,090 --> 02:14:59,670
Eventually.

2461
02:14:59,670 --> 02:15:00,510
Wait for the end.

2462
02:15:00,510 --> 02:15:05,000
I'm not gonna skip the after credits.

2463
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,560
Don't act like you were paying attention.

2464
02:15:07,560 --> 02:15:08,600
I was, what do you mean?

2465
02:15:08,600 --> 02:15:12,119
Of course I was.

2466
02:15:12,119 --> 02:15:16,609
What's next after this?

2467
02:15:16,609 --> 02:15:19,829
Hold on a minute, that's really cool.

2468
02:15:19,829 --> 02:15:23,550
So those were custom-made comic books for this game.

2469
02:15:23,550 --> 02:15:30,319
Is that what I'm understanding?

2470
02:15:30,319 --> 02:15:32,680
That's pretty cool.

2471
02:15:32,680 --> 02:15:41,760
Hold on.

2472
02:15:41,760 --> 02:15:43,119
Well, I was pretty upset to be woken up

2473
02:15:43,119 --> 02:15:46,369
so late for an impromptu autopsy,

2474
02:15:46,369 --> 02:15:49,539
but when they told me that it was the actual womb ripper,

2475
02:15:49,539 --> 02:15:53,430
well, I got down here as soon as I could.

2476
02:15:53,430 --> 02:15:56,229
I can't believe that it turned out to be Samantha Rhodes,

2477
02:15:56,229 --> 02:15:59,550
who'd gone missing and was presumed dead years ago.

2478
02:15:59,550 --> 02:16:00,909
So what I did is I do what I do

2479
02:16:00,909 --> 02:16:04,310
with all of these potential serial killer maniacs.

2480
02:16:04,310 --> 02:16:05,949
I stand across the room first,

2481
02:16:05,949 --> 02:16:07,550
even though they're supposed to be dead,

2482
02:16:07,550 --> 02:16:09,029
and I throw a fucking brick

2483
02:16:09,029 --> 02:16:11,869
as fast and as hard as I can at their head

2484
02:16:11,909 --> 02:16:14,109
to make sure that they're not gonna get up and scare me

2485
02:16:14,109 --> 02:16:38,000
and grab me and stab me with a knife.

2486
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:39,760
The fuse box is down the hall.

2487
02:16:39,760 --> 02:16:41,629
Yeah, great.

2488
02:16:41,629 --> 02:16:43,430
I wonder what happens here.

2489
02:16:43,430 --> 02:16:48,229
You should have threw the brick.

2490
02:16:48,229 --> 02:16:50,670
I mean, like, honestly, it's like, do we need to,

2491
02:16:50,670 --> 02:16:52,520
just, mm-mm.

2492
02:16:52,520 --> 02:16:57,930
Always keep a brick with your, no.

2493
02:16:57,930 --> 02:17:08,379
God damn it, I thought it was over.

2494
02:17:08,379 --> 02:17:41,239
Shut the fuck up.

2495
02:17:41,239 --> 02:17:42,079
No, don't.

2496
02:17:47,020 --> 02:17:48,219
What the, she's gone.

2497
02:17:48,219 --> 02:17:58,559
I have to get out of here.

2498
02:17:58,559 --> 02:18:00,799
Cause of death, multiple gunshot wounds.

2499
02:18:00,799 --> 02:18:01,920
That's the official cause of death,

2500
02:18:01,920 --> 02:18:03,360
but Jesus Christ, I don't even understand

2501
02:18:03,360 --> 02:18:06,739
how she was still alive in the first place.

2502
02:18:06,739 --> 02:18:08,020
I took so many shots to bring her down.

2503
02:18:08,020 --> 02:18:09,899
Most of these look fatal on first glimpse to me.

2504
02:18:09,899 --> 02:18:23,719
Guess we'll dig in to find out more.

2505
02:18:23,719 --> 02:18:26,159
I, okay, well, let's go.

2506
02:18:29,899 --> 02:18:39,899
Oh, how does that, done.

2507
02:18:39,899 --> 02:18:46,020
I'm sorry, but I'm just gonna go right here, right there.

2508
02:18:46,020 --> 02:18:52,809
Just bang.

2509
02:18:52,809 --> 02:19:06,899
You wanna see a fucking, that's fun.

2510
02:19:06,899 --> 02:19:08,059
You should play chess.

2511
02:19:08,059 --> 02:19:11,829
Why would I ever play chess?

2512
02:19:11,829 --> 02:19:13,860
I'm never gonna play chess.

2513
02:19:13,860 --> 02:19:16,700
I, it's too, the game is too high brain for me.

2514
02:19:16,700 --> 02:19:19,100
It's too slow, I need it to be.

2515
02:19:19,100 --> 02:19:20,420
All right, if there was chess,

2516
02:19:20,420 --> 02:19:24,040
where after every move, we got to watch a family guy clip.

2517
02:19:24,040 --> 02:19:25,719
That's just, it just happened.

2518
02:19:25,719 --> 02:19:34,399
Then okay, I'd play it.

2519
02:19:34,399 --> 02:19:36,360
Make the, make a family guy chess.

2520
02:19:36,360 --> 02:19:38,370
And every time I move Peter Griffin,

2521
02:19:38,370 --> 02:19:43,329
he says just a random audio clip from the show.

2522
02:19:43,329 --> 02:19:46,920
It's very clear that they didn't record any new dialogue.

2523
02:19:46,920 --> 02:19:48,760
You move Peter.

2524
02:19:48,760 --> 02:19:51,069
Oh, holy crap, Lois.

2525
02:19:51,069 --> 02:19:55,450
So you didn't record any new audio for this.

2526
02:19:55,450 --> 02:19:58,239
Stewie gets moved, and Stewie just says,

2527
02:19:58,280 --> 02:20:00,479
you can tell he's talking to somebody

2528
02:20:00,479 --> 02:20:03,399
during one of the episodes,

2529
02:20:03,399 --> 02:20:06,270
but it has nothing to do with chess.

2530
02:20:06,270 --> 02:20:12,420
He's on to something.

2531
02:20:12,420 --> 02:20:13,860
No, they know that, that wouldn't happen.

2532
02:20:13,860 --> 02:20:17,180
It wouldn't be, oh, look at me, I'm the king, Lois.

2533
02:20:17,180 --> 02:20:19,200
No, no, no, no, no.

2534
02:20:19,200 --> 02:20:23,430
It would be like a specific, oh, wow.

2535
02:20:23,430 --> 02:20:25,959
I can't believe I became mayor.

2536
02:20:25,959 --> 02:20:30,069
Like, what does that have to do with chess?

2537
02:20:30,069 --> 02:20:35,420
All right, we're gonna go on, we're gonna move on.

2538
02:20:35,420 --> 02:20:41,600
Play checkers, I'm not gonna play checkers.

2539
02:20:41,600 --> 02:20:43,239
All right, I'm gonna take a quick break.

2540
02:20:43,239 --> 02:20:44,719
I'll be right back.

2541
02:20:44,719 --> 02:20:46,639
I'm gonna pee, I'm gonna refill this drink,

2542
02:20:46,639 --> 02:20:48,399
and we're gonna play Murder House.

2543
02:20:48,399 --> 02:20:50,440
That's what's on tap next.

2544
02:20:50,440 --> 02:20:53,969
See you guys in about, I wanna say two minutes,

2545
02:20:53,969 --> 02:20:55,649
maybe a little less.

2546
02:20:55,649 --> 02:20:57,309
We'll find out.

2547
02:20:57,309 --> 02:21:49,440
See you in just a moment.

2548
02:21:49,440 --> 02:21:52,719
Oops, hold on, let me fix it.
