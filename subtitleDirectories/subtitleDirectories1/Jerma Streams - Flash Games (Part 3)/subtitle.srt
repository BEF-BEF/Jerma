1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:02,710
What's up? How you doing?

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:07,339
There's a bird at my window. I- I- Sorry, I was like, one minute late.

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:12,470
I had to see it. I heard like, a tapping, like tap at the window.

4
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:15,029
I was like, this bird- Ah, it's a bird. It's definitely a bird.

5
00:00:15,589 --> 00:00:21,370
I was like, I gotta see it. I missed him.

6
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:22,809
Didn't see the bird, unfortunately.

7
00:00:24,219 --> 00:00:26,300
Uh, as you get- Listen to me. You hear the voice, right?

8
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:27,820
Kind of getting back to normal.

9
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,460
It's a little, uh, it's a little grungy, but, you know.

10
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:32,780
That's a good excuse.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,600
So, uh, those of you that didn't know,

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,320
the reason why I've been gone for the last like, four or five days,

13
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:42,840
is specifically because I couldn't talk.

14
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,439
I was sick for about a week and a half,

15
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:49,799
with some type of cold or flu or something.

16
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:52,060
I tested negative for COVID.

17
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:54,170
That's a good thing.

18
00:00:55,299 --> 00:00:57,539
But I- I blew out my voice.

19
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:03,929
The day after that last stream, I sounded like this.

20
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:05,049
I couldn't even talk.

21
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:07,209
It was- I blew my voice out somehow.

22
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:12,810
How am I talking now?

23
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:16,060
Um, because that was a week ago.

24
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:22,700
Gion Rivers, yeah.

25
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:26,700
No, the last ti- Yeah, don't we know?

26
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,140
When I turned the stream on last,

27
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,459
that's the last time that I was like, alive.

28
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,510
I just go into like, hibernation.

29
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,069
I go- You just power me off and then you turn me back on.

30
00:01:36,709 --> 00:01:37,829
Hold on, I gotta get auto.

31
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,980
But no, I'm feeling a lot better.

32
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,780
I haven't been sick for probably at least a few days.

33
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:05,459
But I've just barely, last night into today,

34
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:10,680
I haven't had a just completely constricted, horrendous voice.

35
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:12,360
So I didn't want to talk.

36
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,280
So I'm trying to keep my mouth shut.

37
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,430
And here we are now.

38
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,229
I should be fine.

39
00:02:19,909 --> 00:02:22,069
Scrap this shit for an auto stream.

40
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:29,139
Oh, I just want to like, chill and like, play flash games.

41
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:30,659
What do you mean, scrap this shit?

42
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:33,060
People have been asking for flash games for like, a year.

43
00:02:33,939 --> 00:02:35,860
I'm not gonna play cyberpunk.

44
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,990
I probably- I don't know.

45
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,990
I probably will never play cyberpunk.

46
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,610
You want me to be honest?

47
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:47,110
It's probably cool.

48
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:47,590
I don't know.

49
00:02:51,189 --> 00:02:52,150
Maybe eventually.

50
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,219
You mean like, look, I'm like-

51
00:02:55,219 --> 00:02:58,500
I play new games a year after they come out.

52
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,500
Or like, at least a few months.

53
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:02,840
What is this?

54
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,819
Hold on.

55
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:07,780
Cyberpunk sucks.

56
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:08,979
Does it though?

57
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:09,860
I mean, I don't think it does.

58
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,219
Who told you that?

59
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:15,639
We had a bunch of subs come in.

60
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:19,879
Thank you, Nukable, Super Bruce, Bananarism, and TheFooly.

61
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:21,240
All for five community subs.

62
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,520
Back to back to back to back to back.

63
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,889
Thanks guys.

64
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,599
All bugs, no snacks.

65
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,080
But yeah, how- is it- is it any good?

66
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:37,270
Do a cheese and wine tasting stream.

67
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,789
I didn't even tweet this stream out yet.

68
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:39,509
Hold on.

69
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:42,069
Everybody- it says in the title, just chill, okay?

70
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,979
Five subs from any neb subs here.

71
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,099
I don't know.

72
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:52,500
Are there?

73
00:03:53,060 --> 00:04:04,580
Jerma, please, we need the funny.

74
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,819
That's what I'm doing here, man.

75
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:08,500
I'm trying to come back so I can give you the funny.

76
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,500
I almost just like cough- like, flam-puked on you.

77
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,860
And that would have been horrible.

78
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,500
Some of you heard it.

79
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:16,660
Some of you were like, I heard that.

80
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,060
That was like phlegm coming up from like your esophagus

81
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:19,779
all the way into your mouth.

82
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:20,980
You heard it.

83
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,180
I know some of you did.

84
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,699
That's why it took a little bit of time.

85
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:29,769
Also, we have to talk really quickly about, of course,

86
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,889
that an anonymous gifter has given five community subs.

87
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:38,379
Besides that, in the Discord right now,

88
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,949
guess what channel just opened?

89
00:04:41,589 --> 00:04:43,740
Come on, let's see some slugpogs.

90
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,060
Uh, the New Year's Eve nomination and discussion channel is open.

91
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:50,500
You're going to be able to nominate stuff.

92
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:52,660
Maybe even add categories.

93
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,100
It's just open for discussion.

94
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,980
It's going to be up there for another probably eight to ten days.

95
00:04:59,019 --> 00:05:01,019
The voting will commence after that.

96
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:07,100
So you got about ten days to figure out your nominations for the year.

97
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,870
Cyberpunk in two hours?

98
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:11,829
I'm not- I don't care.

99
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:15,560
Look, I'm up playing Cyberpunk.

100
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:24,709
That's a Reddit game.

101
00:05:24,709 --> 00:05:25,910
It's not a Reddit game.

102
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:31,370
No, that's a mainstream, huge video game.

103
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:32,889
So many people are waiting for that.

104
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:35,930
That's not just like Redditors that are waiting to play Cyberpunk.

105
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,569
That game had like 600 million pre-orders.

106
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,220
Only like 12 million people use Reddit.

107
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:45,399
Okay, I gotta- I gotta retweet this.

108
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:48,730
Hold on.

109
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:49,930
It's a Reddit game.

110
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:57,050
I just wrote Cyberpunk and then for like my stream,

111
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,089
but no, I can't do that.

112
00:05:58,089 --> 00:05:58,889
That's misleading.

113
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,819
No, I'm not going to do that.

114
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:08,819
I'm not going to piss people off for no reason.

115
00:06:09,379 --> 00:06:11,399
Although I kind of do that anyways sometimes.

116
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:12,839
I do that like for fun all the time.

117
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:14,899
I didn't even say a title.

118
00:06:14,899 --> 00:06:16,420
I just wrote my stream.

119
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:16,920
Fuck.

120
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:17,939
It's been a week.

121
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:18,980
Give me a- give me a minute.

122
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:21,980
Flash games, dude.

123
00:06:23,019 --> 00:06:24,300
I'm so high right now.

124
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,220
It took so much.

125
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:27,980
Flash games, dude.

126
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:31,959
I'm not- I'm kidding.

127
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:32,279
I'm not.

128
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,399
And then take- I haven't-

129
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:37,079
I have not consumed a marijuana product in probably three weeks, okay?

130
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,220
Relax.

131
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:46,170
Clip it.

132
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:47,910
You can play Dead Space?

133
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:51,029
Yeah, maybe like eventually before I turn 40.

134
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:54,550
Oh, I'm assuming that before I turn 40, I'll play Dead Space.

135
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,620
Oh, you'll see it before I turn 40.

136
00:06:58,259 --> 00:06:59,509
All right.

137
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:00,069
You guys ready?

138
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:02,420
You guys ready for the-

139
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,060
I don't even- hold on.

140
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,100
Wait, let me make sure my-

141
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,339
Because I know everyone's going to freak out and be like,

142
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:07,620
dude, why do you not have click maps?

143
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,259
Come on, dude.

144
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:10,259
I'm going to have them, but I'm going to-

145
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:11,860
It's going to be streamer's choice and then your choice.

146
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,100
I'm on congregate and I'm on armor games.

147
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:17,500
If I missed one, please tell me I missed one.

148
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,019
But I'm just going to play some flash games.

149
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:19,740
Whatever. Let's go.

150
00:07:23,019 --> 00:07:24,300
Let me just get the click maps running.

151
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:33,420
No, not Neopets.

152
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,360
Neopets is- I don't know.

153
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,519
I'm not playing Neopets.

154
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:39,000
Holy shit.

155
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,360
Like how- You know what I want to see?

156
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,860
Am I not logged into Twitch?

157
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,129
What the fuck?

158
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,220
I got logged out of Twitch?

159
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:51,420
Have I not been- Have I not opened it in like three- two weeks?

160
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,310
No, I have to like- Hold on.

161
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,660
You got to feed your little gremlin.

162
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,019
I don't- No, I don't want to do Neopets.

163
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:06,500
They'll die.

164
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:08,920
I'll do a Neopets stream.

165
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,120
We'll hang out for a little while.

166
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,680
And it'll be- Aw, cool.

167
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,279
You got like a little octopus buddy.

168
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,040
Dude, oh my god.

169
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,560
You fed him like his favorite treat.

170
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,680
Like octopus food.

171
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,279
Everyone will freak out and it'll be fine.

172
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:22,439
And then I'll never hear the end of it when after two or three weeks

173
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:23,639
when I don't play the game

174
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:25,480
and people say check on your Neopets and they're all dead.

175
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,879
You guys are going to be very upset with me

176
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:28,680
and I don't want to do that.

177
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:34,419
True. Yeah, I know.

178
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:35,379
I'm- I know.

179
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:36,019
Trust me. I know.

180
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:39,419
All right.

181
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,179
Let me turn on- Let me get click maps ready.

182
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:43,340
Because I know everyone's going to say,

183
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,379
do it, do it, do it.

184
00:08:44,379 --> 00:08:46,139
You're fucking making me so angry.

185
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:47,419
You're pissing me off Jeremy.

186
00:08:47,419 --> 00:08:48,539
There's no click maps.

187
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:50,779
I'm going to punch you in the mouth.

188
00:08:50,779 --> 00:08:52,379
I'm going to punch you as hard as I can in the mouth.

189
00:08:53,259 --> 00:08:53,899
Like, all right.

190
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:54,860
Well, just relax.

191
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:55,580
It's in the title.

192
00:08:56,379 --> 00:08:58,570
Okay.

193
00:08:58,570 --> 00:08:59,529
Uh, shall we?

194
00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:00,250
What should I start with?

195
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,370
Kongregate or Armored Games?

196
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:02,330
I guess it doesn't really matter, right?

197
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:03,529
We'll go to Armored Games first.

198
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:10,490
Why are people already doing click maps?

199
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:12,870
Stop clicking on the screen.

200
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:13,509
It's not ready yet.

201
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:15,740
Stop clicking.

202
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,700
I have to- I just turned it off.

203
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,860
Viruses everywhere.

204
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,059
There's no viruses here.

205
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:21,940
Relax.

206
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,580
It's in the title.

207
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:23,940
Come on, quit.

208
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:29,000
Hey, we get it.

209
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,639
You smoke.

210
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:30,200
I don't.

211
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:32,409
So what should I play?

212
00:09:32,409 --> 00:09:33,590
What we got?

213
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:34,389
These are new games.

214
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:35,590
How about Bouncy Quest?

215
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:36,789
Is Bouncy Quest any good?

216
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,440
Has anybody played Bouncy Quest?

217
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:42,919
I don't know.

218
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:43,399
Let's try it.

219
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,039
Oh, can I make this full screen?

220
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:47,240
Please tell me I can.

221
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:51,529
Turn it on.

222
00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:52,090
I just did.

223
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:54,730
Loading.

224
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:55,049
Okay.

225
00:09:55,049 --> 00:09:57,450
Is there a full screen in- on, uh, Armored Games?

226
00:09:59,049 --> 00:09:59,549
Ow!

227
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,759
This just happened in real life.

228
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,629
I- that's- I seriously feel like I got hit in the head by a frying pan.

229
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,659
I got hit right in the fucking head by a frying pan.

230
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,419
I gotta turn this on in my mixer.

231
00:10:13,419 --> 00:10:16,840
I- I know that's- I feel like that's what it would feel like.

232
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:18,779
Jesus.

233
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:24,169
I end up with like-

234
00:10:24,169 --> 00:10:24,570
Okay.

235
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:25,210
Is that better?

236
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,450
Am I gonna zoom this shit in?

237
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:32,299
The hell?

238
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:36,659
I have to manual zoom?

239
00:10:37,299 --> 00:10:39,590
Is a dev in chat?

240
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:40,870
No, no, no.

241
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:41,190
Leave it.

242
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:41,429
Leave it.

243
00:10:41,429 --> 00:10:42,149
What do you mean leave it?

244
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:42,950
Control plus.

245
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,870
No, I- I'm gonna- I'm gonna do a manual zoom.

246
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:54,580
No.

247
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,340
Hey, we're doing the Game Awards tomorrow, by the way.

248
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,100
Those of you that make it excited over that one.

249
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:01,350
All right.

250
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,309
We got the manual zoom.

251
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,860
What the fuck?

252
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,690
What just happened?

253
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,639
I'm supposed to be playing Bouncy Quest.

254
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,169
Did I just open up like an ad page?

255
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,179
Okay.

256
00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:14,340
Wait.

257
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,779
Now it's not zoomed in for me, though.

258
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:17,220
This needs to be zoomed in.

259
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,740
Oh, I need to do a manual zoom on my own.

260
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,620
Control plus, right?

261
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:21,669
Okay.

262
00:11:21,669 --> 00:11:22,070
I got it.

263
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:22,389
I got it.

264
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:22,549
I got it.

265
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:22,789
I got it.

266
00:11:22,789 --> 00:11:23,509
I manual zoom.

267
00:11:23,509 --> 00:11:25,590
I have to manual zoom and then I'm gonna manual zoom you out.

268
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,210
Omega low.

269
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:38,490
Quiet.

270
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:40,980
Quiet.

271
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,169
All right.

272
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:42,730
That was-

273
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:43,210
Now we're fine.

274
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:44,490
We're playing Bouncy Quest.

275
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:44,730
All right.

276
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:45,210
How do we play?

277
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:48,139
Oh, this has got a good soundtrack.

278
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,500
Super foil.

279
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,539
Thanks for the 10 community subs.

280
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:55,399
Level select.

281
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:56,200
Level one.

282
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:56,919
Bouncy Quest.

283
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,779
How do you play Boun-

284
00:11:58,779 --> 00:11:59,259
How do you play?

285
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:01,080
Save your-

286
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,200
Use the arrow keys to move.

287
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,870
Okay.

288
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:05,429
There's one.

289
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,659
It's not centered.

290
00:12:07,659 --> 00:12:07,980
All right.

291
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:08,940
Just hold on.

292
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:09,580
I'm trying.

293
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,700
I'm working on it.

294
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:18,299
There.

295
00:12:18,299 --> 00:12:18,779
Is it better?

296
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,360
That's better.

297
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:20,600
Okay.

298
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,000
We're fine.

299
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:23,029
All right.

300
00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:23,509
Let's go.

301
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:25,500
Let's go.

302
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,740
Hey, Syrophunk.

303
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,139
No.

304
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:31,019
Fuck Syrophunk.

305
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:32,539
We're playing Bouncy Quest.

306
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:38,809
Play this is the only level.

307
00:12:38,809 --> 00:12:39,769
Watch out for spikes.

308
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:43,080
This is fun.

309
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,720
I like this.

310
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,600
How do you jump higher?

311
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:46,440
That one's extra bouncy quest.

312
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:49,990
This is the only level.

313
00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:53,190
Obviously, this is level four.

314
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:53,909
I don't know what you're talking about.

315
00:12:53,909 --> 00:12:55,029
Watch out for enemy slime.

316
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,480
Jump on to eliminate.

317
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:00,279
I said that right, right?

318
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:00,840
Eliminate.

319
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:02,200
Did I say that wrong?

320
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:03,480
That was weird, right?

321
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,000
Thank you for winning those.

322
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,799
What?

323
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:17,509
This dude is zonked.

324
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:20,299
I'm not zonked.

325
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:23,830
Dude, when does Syrophunk come out?

326
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:24,629
Oh, dude.

327
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:25,509
Syrophunk.

328
00:13:26,409 --> 00:13:26,889
What?

329
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:27,610
When they-

330
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:28,809
Do not leap when they sleep.

331
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:33,220
Hey, I got a cyber game for you.

332
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,389
Hey, guys.

333
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:38,230
I got a cyber game early.

334
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,480
Oh, he did, didn't he?

335
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:47,299
Does he get an early copy of-

336
00:13:47,299 --> 00:13:48,500
Does he have a copy of a game

337
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,690
that people don't have right now?

338
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:52,730
I wonder what that could be.

339
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:54,679
Of course.

340
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:57,000
I mean, please don't be naked.

341
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,840
Of course, I'm talking about Siberia.

342
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,970
27, 2027.

343
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:09,340
Siberia, the year 2027 for the 3DO.

344
00:14:10,419 --> 00:14:11,620
You don't think I came prepared

345
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,340
for the launch of-

346
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,620
This is the right one, right?

347
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:23,659
This is the right one.

348
00:14:23,659 --> 00:14:25,340
Mom, your mother at GameStop

349
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,340
that buys you the wrong game.

350
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,059
No, mom.

351
00:14:32,259 --> 00:14:33,779
I didn't want the SpongeBob game.

352
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:34,899
I wanted GTA.

353
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:38,090
Henry, you're 14.

354
00:14:38,809 --> 00:14:40,250
Mom, buy me that game

355
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:50,889
where you can see naked people.

356
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:51,529
Hey, idiot.

357
00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:51,769
What?

358
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,059
Fuck, hold on.

359
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:54,940
This game's cool.

360
00:14:55,659 --> 00:14:56,539
Siberia.

361
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,480
You got an emote.

362
00:14:59,480 --> 00:14:59,960
I did?

363
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,279
Why?

364
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:04,389
Make sure you-

365
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:05,350
Do the nominations, guys.

366
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,309
Make sure you get some nominations

367
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:07,750
and you only got like 10 days.

368
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:11,779
How do I keep dying from the same person?

369
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:12,659
It's like, have I not-

370
00:15:12,659 --> 00:15:13,779
Have I not burned in my memory

371
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:14,980
that that person is here?

372
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:24,759
This music's pretty good, though, I will say.

373
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:26,309
What's this game called?

374
00:15:26,309 --> 00:15:35,879
Bouncy Castle?

375
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:36,679
Dev here?

376
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:37,860
Where's the dev?

377
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,509
Do you want to know where the dev is?

378
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:43,980
Certified idiot.

379
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:44,299
What?

380
00:15:44,299 --> 00:15:45,019
I'm doing fine.

381
00:15:51,769 --> 00:15:52,889
I'm fine.

382
00:15:52,889 --> 00:15:53,529
Look at chat.

383
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:54,889
Stop!

384
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:55,929
Leave me alone.

385
00:15:55,929 --> 00:15:56,570
No screaming.

386
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:57,690
My voice is gone.

387
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,289
I just looked over at chat.

388
00:15:59,289 --> 00:16:00,970
I have not had any Marijuana products

389
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,169
in like three weeks, okay?

390
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:07,639
Relax.

391
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:09,559
Thank you BBB for the five community-

392
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:10,519
A lot of community subs today.

393
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:11,159
What are you guys doing?

394
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:17,419
I think I'm done with-

395
00:16:17,419 --> 00:16:17,740
Okay.

396
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,580
I'm done with fucking Bouncy Quest.

397
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,659
I swear to God, I'm not like pretending.

398
00:16:21,659 --> 00:16:22,700
I gotta beat this level, though.

399
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,899
I'm not pretending.

400
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:27,500
By the way, speaking of pretending,

401
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:32,389
that is a new category in the 2020

402
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:35,850
Vest of Worst of the Year.

403
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:38,889
In your nominations for the new category of Worst,

404
00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:41,210
he is pretending moment where you thought

405
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,330
I had to have been making it up.

406
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:43,690
There's no way it would be fake.

407
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:45,720
There's no way it would be real, I mean.

408
00:16:56,659 --> 00:16:57,460
I'm not.

409
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:03,590
I swear to God.

410
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,390
I promise.

411
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:08,500
Bouncy Louncy?

412
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,059
What?

413
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:11,049
I had timed that person out.

414
00:17:11,049 --> 00:17:12,009
I don't know what they said.

415
00:17:12,009 --> 00:17:12,970
All right, I'm done.

416
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,730
I'm done with Bouncy Castle.

417
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,329
I don't want to play it anymore.

418
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:18,329
No more Bouncy Castle for me.

419
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:20,490
This is so easy.

420
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:20,809
And I just-

421
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:22,250
I'm just like not paying attention.

422
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,289
Pay attention.

423
00:17:23,289 --> 00:17:39,579
I'm so glad I didn't decide to play Spelunky 2 today.

424
00:17:39,579 --> 00:17:41,019
It's just not one of those days, right?

425
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:41,740
You can already tell.

426
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:43,660
It's not one of those days.

427
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,720
I beat it, see?

428
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,079
Are you gonna cry on New Year's?

429
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:48,359
Are you gonna cry on New Year's?

430
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:48,839
What?

431
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:49,559
What are you talking about?

432
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,619
Jump on top to break.

433
00:17:53,619 --> 00:18:03,960
It's one.

434
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,460
Wink.

435
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,140
Wink.

436
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:12,539
Stop breaking them, you dickhead.

437
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:13,660
I'm gonna do what I'm gonna do.

438
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,460
Can you see the mouse?

439
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,180
Oh, shit.

440
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,539
That's what everybody was yelling at me for.

441
00:18:17,339 --> 00:18:18,140
Sorry.

442
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,500
Everybody was screaming at me.

443
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:19,980
They were like,

444
00:18:20,779 --> 00:18:21,900
Get it off the screen.

445
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,779
Get it off.

446
00:18:22,779 --> 00:18:28,150
All right, I gotta beat one more level in Bouncy Quest

447
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,390
and then we're gonna move on to the next one.

448
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:30,950
Whatever it is.

449
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,460
I don't know.

450
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:32,940
I'm like-

451
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:33,660
No, we're done.

452
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:39,660
How about Idle Racing?

453
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,390
Simplified racing game where you don't actually race

454
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:44,869
but manage cars, garages, and races.

455
00:18:45,349 --> 00:18:50,660
Each race has its upgrades in racing.

456
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,700
Our choice now.

457
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,200
Okay.

458
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,259
Well, it has to be on a page.

459
00:18:55,589 --> 00:18:56,390
Let me choose.

460
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:56,950
Let me choose.

461
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:58,230
All right, well, okay, hold on.

462
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:02,069
You guys wanna choose one here?

463
00:19:02,069 --> 00:19:10,019
Okay, you guys can choose one here.

464
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:22,890
Go ahead.

465
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:23,289
Today?

466
00:19:24,819 --> 00:19:28,599
Oh.

467
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:29,880
Make him do a puzzle game.

468
00:19:31,059 --> 00:19:32,420
Because there's zero waiting room.

469
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,460
I'll go back to that-

470
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,900
I'll go back to that after the game awards.

471
00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:39,059
Just let one random person choose.

472
00:19:39,619 --> 00:19:40,900
Maybe I'll do that eventually.

473
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,779
I'm just hanging out today.

474
00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:43,220
I'm just trying to ease back into it, man.

475
00:19:44,859 --> 00:19:46,140
All right, looks like we have-

476
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,259
I mean, I said I-

477
00:19:47,259 --> 00:19:48,619
The streamer said the thing.

478
00:19:48,619 --> 00:19:50,380
So that's why everybody clicked it, right?

479
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,640
I guess we're gonna do Idle Racing for a little while.

480
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,759
See how much I like it.

481
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:56,440
Hey, Under Armour, thanks for the five-

482
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,559
That's not your name.

483
00:19:57,559 --> 00:20:03,130
Under Andrew, thanks for the five community subs.

484
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,730
All right, we'll do an Idle Racing.

485
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:05,450
Thanks for voting.

486
00:20:06,009 --> 00:20:09,190
See if this game's any good.

487
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:16,650
Rigged.

488
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:17,819
I wasn't rigged.

489
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,029
Play This Is The Only Level.

490
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:24,869
All right, I'll play This Is The Only Level in like a-

491
00:20:24,869 --> 00:20:25,349
In a minute.

492
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:29,240
Idle Racing, buy your first car and start-

493
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:29,720
Hold on.

494
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,920
You guys, this is way too-

495
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,720
This is messed up here.

496
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,359
Hold on.

497
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:40,569
You're gonna play the game I want.

498
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,400
All right, that's better, right?

499
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,990
You're gonna play the game I want.

500
00:20:47,339 --> 00:20:48,619
I probably will eventually.

501
00:20:48,619 --> 00:20:49,660
You just gotta be patient.

502
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,650
Okay, buy your first car and start racing.

503
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:53,369
Go to dealer.

504
00:20:55,019 --> 00:20:55,980
No sponsor.

505
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,019
Compact car.

506
00:20:57,019 --> 00:20:57,660
I like those.

507
00:20:58,619 --> 00:20:59,339
Family car.

508
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:01,269
No sponsor.

509
00:21:01,269 --> 00:21:01,910
City car.

510
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:04,569
Or off-road.

511
00:21:04,569 --> 00:21:05,369
Let us pick.

512
00:21:05,369 --> 00:21:06,009
No.

513
00:21:06,009 --> 00:21:08,180
All right, well, I wanna do a city car.

514
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,779
Probably, I don't know, the Simpsons car?

515
00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:14,940
Okay, I'm gonna do the Simpsons.

516
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,740
Homer Simpson's car.

517
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,940
How much money do I have?

518
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,430
Where's my money?

519
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:23,299
City, 5300.

520
00:21:23,299 --> 00:21:23,940
Where's my money?

521
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:29,180
Wait, is this an ad?

522
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:33,190
Go to the dealer.

523
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:33,829
Buy your first-

524
00:21:33,829 --> 00:21:34,549
No sponsor.

525
00:21:34,549 --> 00:21:35,109
Compact.

526
00:21:35,109 --> 00:21:39,319
Oh, I just have to get one of these.

527
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:40,519
I don't have-

528
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:41,000
Oh, I have-

529
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,640
Where's my money?

530
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,500
This is how much money I have.

531
00:21:46,809 --> 00:21:49,289
Oh, okay, it's up there.

532
00:21:49,289 --> 00:21:50,779
It's a little too big.

533
00:21:50,779 --> 00:21:51,099
Hold on.

534
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:59,019
Just look, you fucking dope.

535
00:21:59,019 --> 00:22:02,119
Okay, I'm just gonna get a basic compact car.

536
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:03,880
One acceleration, one speed,

537
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,650
one hindrance.

538
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:07,450
Bought it.

539
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:09,690
Okay, now we go to the race.

540
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:14,869
This one here, free race.

541
00:22:14,869 --> 00:22:16,309
First place gets $50.

542
00:22:16,309 --> 00:22:17,750
Takes five seconds.

543
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:18,549
Select my car.

544
00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:19,349
I'm gonna be using-

545
00:22:19,349 --> 00:22:20,710
The winning chance is bad on this one,

546
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:21,430
but okay, race.

547
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,920
Okay, I'm done.

548
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,319
Give me another one.

549
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,519
I don't wanna do this.

550
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:33,980
I wanna get a better one.

551
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:34,460
This game's-

552
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,180
I don't know.

553
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,859
This is like a game that you sit on the toilet

554
00:22:36,859 --> 00:22:37,740
and play for like four hours.

555
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,019
All right, give me another one.

556
00:22:39,019 --> 00:22:41,930
What was it called?

557
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:42,890
This is the Only Level?

558
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:44,089
Should I play that one?

559
00:22:44,089 --> 00:22:47,319
Or do Simpocalypse?

560
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:49,079
Streamer's Choice.

561
00:22:49,079 --> 00:23:00,019
Guys, I'm gonna be here all night.

562
00:23:00,019 --> 00:23:00,500
We're good.

563
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,180
I'll be here for like at least five hours.

564
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,259
This is the demo version.

565
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,700
Standalone game with all unlocked features

566
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:13,509
is coming to Steam on December 15th, 2020.

567
00:23:13,509 --> 00:23:14,009
Uh-oh.

568
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,259
So, should I play the demo?

569
00:23:18,259 --> 00:23:18,980
What if I like it?

570
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:23,000
Sign up for the beta.

571
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,619
Hold on, it's too zoomed in.

572
00:23:25,619 --> 00:23:29,640
I'm not gonna put my email in anywhere.

573
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:33,880
How would I put my email in?

574
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:40,519
Do it, do it.

575
00:23:41,529 --> 00:23:42,329
Guys, you got-

576
00:23:42,329 --> 00:23:43,130
Some of you might remember,

577
00:23:43,849 --> 00:23:44,970
back in the day,

578
00:23:45,769 --> 00:23:46,809
there would be a mall.

579
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,660
Just, they would-

580
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,420
Well, of course, there would be a mall.

581
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,859
You know, back then when there were malls.

582
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,019
At your mall,

583
00:23:54,019 --> 00:23:55,769
there used to be a little drop box

584
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:58,009
where you would just sign up to try to win something.

585
00:23:58,009 --> 00:23:59,380
You would put all your information on it

586
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,420
and drop it into a little box

587
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:02,980
and hope you like got like your name on a list or something.

588
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,180
Or you got where-

589
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,299
This is like-

590
00:24:05,299 --> 00:24:08,019
This is dropping your name in that like mall box

591
00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:11,299
of signing up for shit.

592
00:24:11,299 --> 00:24:14,019
Just, you're just giving an email to somebody.

593
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:14,900
And what are they gonna use it for?

594
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,740
Are they gonna tell you about beta testing?

595
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,420
They might.

596
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:23,130
It's not a bad analogy.

597
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:23,690
No, it's not.

598
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,390
Maybe you just write their full addresses and shit

599
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:27,750
and put it in that slot.

600
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,849
Your email address is your like on-

601
00:24:29,849 --> 00:24:31,769
Your email address is your online address.

602
00:24:31,769 --> 00:24:34,170
You don't want anybody to have that shit that you don't want.

603
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:37,109
That's why it's called email address.

604
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:39,029
It's your internet e-address.

605
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:41,180
No, it's not.

606
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:41,980
Yes, it is.

607
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,240
You gotta be careful.

608
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,279
Don't fuck around.

609
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:49,430
That's your IP.

610
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:49,910
No, it's not.

611
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:50,789
It's your email address.

612
00:24:51,509 --> 00:24:55,940
The world as you know it is gone.

613
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:58,180
Human greed inevitably led to war.

614
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,390
After 10 years, the radiation settled down

615
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:03,430
enough for small groups of survivors to start coming out of their nuclear shelters.

616
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:07,099
You are the leader of one of them.

617
00:25:07,099 --> 00:25:09,079
Okay.

618
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:12,230
Everything is ruined.

619
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,029
Resources seem gone.

620
00:25:13,029 --> 00:25:15,190
But this must not be our end.

621
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:17,190
Explore and establish your settlement to survive.

622
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,069
Good luck.

623
00:25:18,069 --> 00:25:21,660
Okay.

624
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,430
Starting boost.

625
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:24,789
Select your home continent.

626
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:25,940
Start in Africa.

627
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:29,369
Plus 30% faster builders suggested.

628
00:25:29,369 --> 00:25:29,849
Australia.

629
00:25:29,849 --> 00:25:31,130
Plus 20% mining rate.

630
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:31,450
Europe.

631
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:34,859
Plus 20% knowledge gain.

632
00:25:34,859 --> 00:25:35,180
Asia.

633
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,380
Plus 30% citizen gain.

634
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,019
North America.

635
00:25:37,019 --> 00:25:41,579
Plus 50% lower market spread.

636
00:25:41,579 --> 00:25:42,380
Antarctica.

637
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,059
Plus 40% water gain.

638
00:25:47,369 --> 00:25:50,539
Uh, the mining.

639
00:25:50,539 --> 00:25:59,380
Let's do North America.

640
00:25:59,380 --> 00:25:59,700
I don't know.

641
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,460
50% lower market spread.

642
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,619
Whatever.

643
00:26:02,619 --> 00:26:03,819
Start exploring.

644
00:26:03,819 --> 00:26:12,940
Get out of your shelter and start exploring for resources to survive the post-apocalyptic era.

645
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:16,539
Your group of survivors is small, but maybe you can find others.

646
00:26:16,539 --> 00:26:18,940
Start by exploring the area around your shelter.

647
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,539
There have to be resources we can use around here.

648
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:22,740
I'm not nexting already.

649
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:22,980
What?

650
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:23,940
We did that already.

651
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,859
Start...

652
00:26:25,859 --> 00:26:29,380
Assign some explorers.

653
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:29,779
Okay.

654
00:26:29,779 --> 00:26:32,740
Assign some citizens to focus on exploring and look for resources.

655
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,470
And mom, don't next me yet.

656
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:35,109
I'm not ready.

657
00:26:35,349 --> 00:26:38,019
Okay, so I want to put...

658
00:26:38,019 --> 00:26:38,740
Assign explorers.

659
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,460
Okay, they're exploring.

660
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:44,869
Scavengers.

661
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:48,230
Assign citizens to start collecting food for your explorers.

662
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:49,269
Oh, this is cool.

663
00:26:49,269 --> 00:26:50,579
It's just like a...

664
00:26:50,579 --> 00:26:52,980
Everyone, you kind of spread people out to do different tasks and stuff.

665
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,619
It's an idle game.

666
00:26:53,619 --> 00:26:53,859
I know.

667
00:26:53,859 --> 00:26:54,339
All right.

668
00:26:54,339 --> 00:26:55,430
Just let me...

669
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:55,990
Give me a minute.

670
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,740
Let me see how good it is.

671
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,099
And have one scavenger.

672
00:26:59,099 --> 00:27:04,390
I'm seeing a lot of resident sleepers and it's really starting to make me self-conscious as a streamer.

673
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:07,029
Let's go with five scavengers.

674
00:27:07,029 --> 00:27:13,640
It's making me look a little self-conscious.

675
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,839
Water and food are critical.

676
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:18,809
Drinking water.

677
00:27:18,809 --> 00:27:20,250
Oh, um...

678
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,369
Okay, I guess...

679
00:27:21,369 --> 00:27:28,980
You know when you get yourself in trouble here?

680
00:27:29,619 --> 00:27:31,940
I was too lazy to type in armorgames.com.

681
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:34,259
I searched Armor Games.

682
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:36,740
Is Armor Games a safe website?

683
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:41,109
I couldn't just write armorgames.com.

684
00:27:41,109 --> 00:27:41,589
No.

685
00:27:41,589 --> 00:27:51,660
I had to search for it and then click on it.

686
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:54,539
That's lazy, but that's lazy for all the wrong reasons.

687
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:57,299
Because it's adding extra steps.

688
00:27:57,299 --> 00:27:59,460
That's kind of bizarre.

689
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:03,000
Okay, what should I play?

690
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,200
What's this on the front page?

691
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:04,440
This is...

692
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,400
Oh wait, popular games.

693
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,119
Here we go.

694
00:28:08,099 --> 00:28:08,900
Raid Heroes.

695
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,859
Total War.

696
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:12,500
Mob Wars.

697
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,019
Which one of these is actually, like, should I play?

698
00:28:14,579 --> 00:28:18,259
This is not the only level.

699
00:28:18,259 --> 00:28:19,059
This is not...

700
00:28:19,059 --> 00:28:20,579
Please sort by god.

701
00:28:20,579 --> 00:28:20,819
What?

702
00:28:22,089 --> 00:28:23,049
Sort by god.

703
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:27,700
All games.

704
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:28,500
Action games.

705
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:32,839
Wait, hold on.

706
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:33,640
Adventure games.

707
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:35,960
There is no game.

708
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:46,279
Did we do that one?

709
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:46,599
Yes.

710
00:28:47,609 --> 00:28:47,849
Okay.

711
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:51,829
If you like this non-game, go check out the Steam page.

712
00:28:51,829 --> 00:28:53,349
What do you mean, Steam page?

713
00:28:53,349 --> 00:28:59,700
Is this another one of those you sign up for the beta because there's a demo?

714
00:29:00,259 --> 00:29:04,519
Better with audio.

715
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:14,309
Is this a crosshair?

716
00:29:14,309 --> 00:29:15,430
Not a game.

717
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:17,819
By Kamizoto.

718
00:29:19,539 --> 00:29:22,420
Probably not made with constructs.

719
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,660
There is no game.

720
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:36,970
I was feeling very leave.

721
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:38,089
There's no game.

722
00:29:38,089 --> 00:29:41,619
So I hope you're not too much disappointed.

723
00:29:41,619 --> 00:29:49,480
You can still watch TV, go outside, read a book, ask for refund.

724
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,750
And that game is free.

725
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,869
This is not a game.

726
00:29:55,509 --> 00:29:57,430
It has nothing to do with the game.

727
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:00,950
It's just a massive package of boredom.

728
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:04,630
Okay, cool.

729
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:08,150
So I just sit here and let this guy give me comedy lines, right?

730
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:09,190
There's nothing to do in here.

731
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:11,079
Start clicking on stuff?

732
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:14,490
You can quit and leave me alone.

733
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:17,130
Sorry.

734
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:19,849
What have you done?

735
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:22,250
You've just ruined the title.

736
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:23,529
Put it back.

737
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:25,289
Put the latter back.

738
00:30:25,289 --> 00:30:26,009
Okay.

739
00:30:26,009 --> 00:30:26,250
No.

740
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:26,650
Come on.

741
00:30:28,009 --> 00:30:29,289
I'm trying to put the letter back, dude.

742
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:31,289
Never mind.

743
00:30:31,289 --> 00:30:33,529
I will fix it next time someone reloads the game.

744
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:35,289
Non-game.

745
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:37,529
No game here.

746
00:30:38,089 --> 00:30:41,880
No game.

747
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,160
He said no game.

748
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:43,960
Click game.

749
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,759
No game.

750
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:55,109
Do I have to refresh the page?

751
00:30:55,109 --> 00:30:56,150
Pop right.

752
00:30:56,150 --> 00:31:00,759
Delete the Y.

753
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:01,000
What?

754
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,519
What is this?

755
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,700
I can't click it.

756
00:31:05,589 --> 00:31:06,309
Use the O.

757
00:31:11,029 --> 00:31:12,250
What?

758
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:13,049
Delete the A.

759
00:31:13,769 --> 00:31:15,450
I can't do anything.

760
00:31:16,089 --> 00:31:19,259
There is no game-o.

761
00:31:19,259 --> 00:31:21,420
I don't know.

762
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:25,529
There-o-e-o is...

763
00:31:25,529 --> 00:31:29,339
I don't know.

764
00:31:29,339 --> 00:31:29,740
Duh.

765
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,099
What do I do?

766
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:32,700
Oh, shit.

767
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,880
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

768
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,599
Seriously.

769
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:41,019
Are you going to break everything?

770
00:31:41,019 --> 00:31:41,819
I muted him.

771
00:31:41,819 --> 00:31:46,009
That was horrible.

772
00:31:46,009 --> 00:31:46,490
Finally.

773
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:47,369
Well, I get it.

774
00:31:47,369 --> 00:31:53,059
You're trying to kill me.

775
00:31:53,059 --> 00:31:54,740
Am I putting like a bag over his head?

776
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,740
As you love to click everywhere.

777
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,779
What do you think about that?

778
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:01,460
All right.

779
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,259
I have to crush him.

780
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:03,539
I can still get it.

781
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:08,710
Stop it now.

782
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:11,509
I think we're good.

783
00:32:11,509 --> 00:32:12,230
Sorry.

784
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:15,750
I had to use the sort of procedures, but I had to.

785
00:32:16,549 --> 00:32:17,509
I love the voice.

786
00:32:17,509 --> 00:32:18,309
I love the accent.

787
00:32:18,309 --> 00:32:20,549
He sounds like, oh, what's his name?

788
00:32:20,549 --> 00:32:22,069
Oh, my God.

789
00:32:22,069 --> 00:32:23,509
I'm trying to bring that one.

790
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:24,470
Oh, it's his name.

791
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:24,950
Peter.

792
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:25,910
Oh, Peter.

793
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:27,509
It's Peter.

794
00:32:27,509 --> 00:32:28,309
What is it?

795
00:32:28,309 --> 00:32:30,099
Peter.

796
00:32:30,099 --> 00:32:31,859
Oh, he's in...

797
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:36,549
What's the game with the horror game?

798
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:37,930
Yes.

799
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:38,809
Stormer.

800
00:32:38,809 --> 00:32:40,089
Peter Stormer.

801
00:32:40,089 --> 00:32:42,140
I love that accent.

802
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:48,950
It's great.

803
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:52,019
You're a stubborn as a mule.

804
00:32:52,019 --> 00:32:53,460
Call Superman for that one.

805
00:32:54,099 --> 00:32:54,819
What's his name?

806
00:32:54,819 --> 00:32:55,619
I don't know.

807
00:32:55,619 --> 00:32:56,180
Stormer?

808
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,019
Stormerage.

809
00:32:59,019 --> 00:32:59,660
Stormare?

810
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:03,779
I know Superman does not exist, but as we're in a game...

811
00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:04,579
No, we're not.

812
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,589
The guy from Fargo?

813
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:09,349
You're still there.

814
00:33:09,349 --> 00:33:09,910
Wait, what?

815
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:14,599
You're thinking about how to live that big days on you.

816
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:15,720
Check this shit out, guys.

817
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:23,559
Now you get audio cues as to how fast I can do that.

818
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:26,890
What was that?

819
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:27,450
What were they doing?

820
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:29,049
Oh, pick up the O and drop the O there.

821
00:33:34,859 --> 00:33:35,900
Grab the E.

822
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:36,859
Grab the H.

823
00:33:36,859 --> 00:33:40,279
It's going to be a screamer.

824
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:41,000
I don't think so.

825
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:44,920
It's a hit sound?

826
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:47,980
It kind of is, isn't it?

827
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:51,450
It is a hit sound.

828
00:33:57,049 --> 00:33:59,369
Yeah, you have Pyro running around holding down the button.

829
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,740
You just turn the corner on Dust Bowl,

830
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:06,259
and you don't even care if you instantly explode.

831
00:34:06,259 --> 00:34:07,859
The final point on Dust Bowl,

832
00:34:07,859 --> 00:34:11,139
when there's like four engineers with four sentry guns pointing at you,

833
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:13,139
you just turn the last corner,

834
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:15,460
and even though you're dead in a half of a second,

835
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,980
you hold the button down and you hear this.

836
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,420
And then you hear...

837
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,539
You're like, yeah, yeah, you're still on fire.

838
00:34:29,539 --> 00:34:30,820
Oh, you fucks.

839
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:35,530
Oh, shit.

840
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:36,809
Yes, yes, go on.

841
00:34:36,809 --> 00:34:37,769
This is for my life.

842
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:39,980
What the mess?

843
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,019
These screws?

844
00:34:41,019 --> 00:34:43,099
I hope you will clean the place before living.

845
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:50,489
Just what do you think you're doing, Yuzuru?

846
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:51,769
This is pretty cool.

847
00:34:51,769 --> 00:34:52,889
There is a game.

848
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:54,010
Don't look.

849
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:55,289
It's private.

850
00:34:55,289 --> 00:34:58,550
You're going to do a terrible mistake.

851
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,219
There is a game.

852
00:35:05,219 --> 00:35:06,420
I can spell it.

853
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:14,539
Oh, cool.

854
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,510
This is one of my favorite games.

855
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,309
Breakout.

856
00:35:18,309 --> 00:35:19,590
Don't play, it's forbidden.

857
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:22,070
If you play, they will come.

858
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:24,550
I don't want them to come.

859
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:25,110
What?

860
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:28,820
They can kill me, you know?

861
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:29,320
Please.

862
00:35:30,019 --> 00:35:31,219
Oh, arrow keys.

863
00:35:31,219 --> 00:35:31,860
How do I move?

864
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:40,519
Oh, bug snacks.

865
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,440
Bug snacks ending.

866
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:43,960
What do you mean?

867
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:44,679
There's a fun game.

868
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:44,920
What?

869
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,800
Oh, fuck.

870
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:49,000
I mean, nobody lists stuff.

871
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,960
Oh, shit.

872
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,579
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

873
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:54,059
What do I say?

874
00:35:54,059 --> 00:35:55,980
What do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do?

875
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,099
What do I do, what do I do?

876
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:03,579
Bug snacks ending like when I ended the stream and I like fucking...

877
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,139
I like played Breakout at the end of that stream.

878
00:36:07,019 --> 00:36:08,860
I must find a way to stop you.

879
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:11,579
No, there's no one talking about like a game ending.

880
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:12,699
Like any spoilers or anything.

881
00:36:13,769 --> 00:36:14,809
I like ended the stream.

882
00:36:15,289 --> 00:36:17,289
And I like went, fuck, I'll play Breakout, who cares?

883
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:22,469
Dude, without the ball.

884
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:25,510
That was a bad save.

885
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:26,070
Look, I'm...

886
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:27,110
No more ball.

887
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:27,670
Who cares?

888
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,780
Actually, I almost just dropped it.

889
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:33,900
Leave now, please.

890
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:38,969
I don't feel well.

891
00:36:38,969 --> 00:36:40,170
What was he talking about?

892
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:41,769
I'm going to be sick.

893
00:36:41,769 --> 00:36:43,769
We just like kind of spoiled the end of bug snacks.

894
00:36:43,769 --> 00:36:46,329
So I just desperately tried to pretend like we did.

895
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:49,130
The one person that doesn't think that we did.

896
00:36:50,539 --> 00:36:51,099
Oh, no.

897
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,099
They're here.

898
00:36:54,789 --> 00:36:55,750
Glitches.

899
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:56,630
He said, we.

900
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:58,070
Well, somebody did.

901
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:59,429
And then I just read it because I'm stupid.

902
00:36:59,989 --> 00:37:01,510
I told you to stop.

903
00:37:02,309 --> 00:37:03,980
You must find a way to get rid of them.

904
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:06,059
How is this even remotely like that, by the way?

905
00:37:06,699 --> 00:37:07,340
How is it...

906
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,059
This doesn't make any sense.

907
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,780
How can I become self-success with all the glitches?

908
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:14,139
Think, think, think.

909
00:37:14,139 --> 00:37:17,340
What the developer will implement will sell a bugged creation.

910
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,139
I'm not talking about spoilers.

911
00:37:18,139 --> 00:37:19,500
I see three possible things.

912
00:37:20,219 --> 00:37:22,380
Gorgeous armed hero girls.

913
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:26,300
Or a ton of zombies and brood, of course.

914
00:37:27,019 --> 00:37:30,059
Or a goat.

915
00:37:30,059 --> 00:37:31,019
Cyberfunk is out.

916
00:37:31,019 --> 00:37:33,019
I know, but try to find one of these three things.

917
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,389
OK, so we have to find...

918
00:37:37,349 --> 00:37:39,559
Does it find a goat?

919
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:46,119
Perhaps the letters can help us.

920
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,619
There is a goat.

921
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:58,409
Sexy girls and zombies.

922
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:00,969
OK, it's attractive in a way.

923
00:38:00,969 --> 00:38:02,489
All right, well, well, we got to go now, all right?

924
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:05,050
Obviously, the cage is locked.

925
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:06,889
You must find the key.

926
00:38:06,889 --> 00:38:07,610
All right, we need a key.

927
00:38:09,429 --> 00:38:10,789
Key, key, key, key, key.

928
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:12,389
Can I spell key?

929
00:38:13,429 --> 00:38:13,989
Key!

930
00:38:13,989 --> 00:38:14,309
Get it!

931
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:15,829
Hey!

932
00:38:15,829 --> 00:38:17,909
That flying squirrel took it.

933
00:38:17,909 --> 00:38:18,869
You must get it back.

934
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:22,230
Find a ladder or something to go up.

935
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:22,710
Something to go up.

936
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:24,230
Something you can climb.

937
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:24,789
What can I climb?

938
00:38:24,789 --> 00:38:25,429
What can I climb?

939
00:38:25,429 --> 00:38:27,590
That reminds me of my childhood.

940
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:28,150
Can I spell it?

941
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:31,429
You used to climb a huge tree in the garden to get back my kite.

942
00:38:32,469 --> 00:38:33,190
Yes, I know what you're trying to do.

943
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:33,750
Climb a tree?

944
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:38,059
Climb a waterfall?

945
00:38:38,059 --> 00:38:39,500
Well, this is a small tree.

946
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,179
And finally, it was bigger.

947
00:38:42,179 --> 00:38:42,980
How do I get a big tree?

948
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:43,860
All right, I'm going to take it over here.

949
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:45,860
Can I bring water over here?

950
00:38:47,139 --> 00:38:51,480
There's water here.

951
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,840
All right, I need to bring the water over here.

952
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,760
How can you bring water to that tree?

953
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,260
Bucket.

954
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,599
Bucket.

955
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:57,960
A container.

956
00:38:59,019 --> 00:39:01,019
A box.

957
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:16,219
I'm going to bring water over here.

958
00:39:16,219 --> 00:39:17,110
I need a bucket.

959
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,000
The rope?

960
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:22,360
That's five letters, man.

961
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,360
Yeah, I'm going to drink it, and I'm going to come back over and regurgitate it into the tree.

962
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:27,800
I need to see the words.

963
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,440
Let me see the letters.

964
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:43,369
I'm more water.

965
00:39:43,369 --> 00:39:44,170
Trophy.

966
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:44,809
Read chat.

967
00:39:44,809 --> 00:39:45,369
The trophy.

968
00:39:49,849 --> 00:40:00,409
Oh, oops.

969
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,340
Backseaters.

970
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:03,579
What?

971
00:40:03,579 --> 00:40:04,780
I didn't know it was actually...

972
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:05,739
Okay, whatever.

973
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:06,300
Give me some more.

974
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,300
Keep going.

975
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:11,619
More.

976
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:14,820
Save the goat.

977
00:40:15,219 --> 00:40:15,699
I'm...

978
00:40:15,699 --> 00:40:16,099
I'm...

979
00:40:16,099 --> 00:40:17,059
That's what I'm trying to do, isn't it?

980
00:40:17,059 --> 00:40:17,699
Trying to save the goat.

981
00:40:18,739 --> 00:40:20,360
We fucking finally did it.

982
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:22,579
Hey, I...

983
00:40:22,579 --> 00:40:22,900
This is...

984
00:40:23,539 --> 00:40:24,619
Give me that key.

985
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:30,969
And then you go over to your friend's house, and they have a fucking really annoying hit sound,

986
00:40:30,969 --> 00:40:33,369
and you just have to play on their terrible hit sound,

987
00:40:33,369 --> 00:40:34,969
and they think it's funny, but you think it's annoying.

988
00:40:35,929 --> 00:40:47,699
Can I go even higher?

989
00:40:47,699 --> 00:40:48,500
All right, I need to take that...

990
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,699
What does a squirrel like?

991
00:40:49,699 --> 00:40:50,019
Nuts.

992
00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:52,280
Uh, nuts.

993
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,719
I kind of smell nuts.

994
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:58,039
Does it go even higher?

995
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:00,550
No, I don't have to go higher.

996
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,760
It's nuts, but there's no N.

997
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:07,659
Can I get a nut somewhere?

998
00:41:10,099 --> 00:41:10,420
Nut.

999
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,019
Uh...

1000
00:41:13,019 --> 00:41:13,980
No, I need water.

1001
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:14,539
I need a nut.

1002
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:21,429
I dropped the...

1003
00:41:21,429 --> 00:41:22,710
I dropped the safe on his head?

1004
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:23,349
Why would I do that?

1005
00:41:23,349 --> 00:41:24,150
That's, like, terrible.

1006
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:31,559
Can I pick...

1007
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:32,199
Can I move this?

1008
00:41:33,929 --> 00:41:34,409
Is it in...

1009
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:35,210
It's in the tree.

1010
00:41:35,849 --> 00:41:37,460
Is it?

1011
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:41,750
Got it.

1012
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:47,420
Shit.

1013
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:47,820
Come here.

1014
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:51,980
I have to break it?

1015
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:52,460
Oh.

1016
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:53,019
All right, wait, wait.

1017
00:41:53,019 --> 00:41:54,619
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.

1018
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,980
Give me that.

1019
00:41:57,619 --> 00:42:04,570
All right, I got the key.

1020
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:05,050
Save the goat.

1021
00:42:11,769 --> 00:42:12,650
Save the goat.

1022
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:13,289
Save the world.

1023
00:42:13,929 --> 00:42:14,170
Open.

1024
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:17,269
He fucking exploded.

1025
00:42:17,269 --> 00:42:17,989
No!

1026
00:42:17,989 --> 00:42:22,820
The goat, it's getting worse.

1027
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:23,860
Goat was a lie.

1028
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:24,820
Oh, gracious.

1029
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:35,269
Now what?

1030
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:42,469
It was wrong.

1031
00:42:42,469 --> 00:42:43,670
It was a bad idea.

1032
00:42:44,699 --> 00:42:45,820
Everything disappeared.

1033
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:47,340
Except me.

1034
00:42:48,139 --> 00:42:49,690
How old is this game?

1035
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:50,170
I don't know.

1036
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:51,130
Probably a lot...

1037
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:52,250
Pretty old.

1038
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:54,179
It's all my fault.

1039
00:42:54,179 --> 00:42:56,099
Please, will you forgive me?

1040
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:05,320
Oh, there it is.

1041
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:05,719
All right.

1042
00:43:06,199 --> 00:43:06,679
That was called...

1043
00:43:07,639 --> 00:43:08,760
There is no game.

1044
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,420
Now should I play there is only one level?

1045
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:14,570
Wait, what did that say?

1046
00:43:16,059 --> 00:43:16,460
World...

1047
00:43:17,099 --> 00:43:20,380
One billion off debt if he gets world record speedrun in any of these games.

1048
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:21,099
That's not gonna happen.

1049
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:22,789
All right.

1050
00:43:22,789 --> 00:43:24,150
Now play there is only one level.

1051
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:26,070
So first there was no game.

1052
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:27,190
But now there's one level.

1053
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:29,829
Okay.

1054
00:43:30,389 --> 00:43:32,869
Is it on here?

1055
00:43:35,139 --> 00:43:37,619
Oh, I played the absolute hell out of this on iPad.

1056
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:41,030
I like almost 100% at this game.

1057
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:41,909
Like a year or two ago.

1058
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:44,059
Is it on here?

1059
00:43:44,059 --> 00:43:48,570
It's called...

1060
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:49,849
There is only one level.

1061
00:43:50,409 --> 00:43:54,469
Just search for it.

1062
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:57,300
Okay.

1063
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,960
There is a bomb.

1064
00:44:02,309 --> 00:44:03,989
I don't think it's on armor games.

1065
00:44:08,699 --> 00:44:10,300
This is the only...

1066
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:13,110
This is a work of fiction.

1067
00:44:13,989 --> 00:44:15,510
This is the only level.

1068
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:15,989
This...

1069
00:44:15,989 --> 00:44:16,630
Four of these.

1070
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:17,110
This is...

1071
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:19,030
This five of these games.

1072
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:21,980
This is the only level.

1073
00:44:23,239 --> 00:44:24,519
This game requires flash.

1074
00:44:24,519 --> 00:44:25,719
Flash is blocked.

1075
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:28,469
Fuck.

1076
00:44:28,469 --> 00:44:28,949
Does it?

1077
00:44:28,949 --> 00:44:29,829
It looks like it's loading.

1078
00:44:33,159 --> 00:44:33,400
Oh.

1079
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:39,219
Well, hold on.

1080
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:42,820
Yeah, by the way, the reason why we're doing this

1081
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:44,260
is because in like two or three weeks,

1082
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:46,739
flash is literally going to be deleted from the internet.

1083
00:44:46,739 --> 00:44:50,010
It's a nice flash games.

1084
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:50,409
Hold on.

1085
00:44:52,969 --> 00:44:53,530
Let me do this.

1086
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:55,460
Go into...

1087
00:44:56,659 --> 00:44:57,860
Go into settings.

1088
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:58,340
Should I do this?

1089
00:44:58,340 --> 00:44:58,820
This is bad.

1090
00:45:00,949 --> 00:45:01,510
Settings.

1091
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:02,230
Site settings.

1092
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:02,630
Flash.

1093
00:45:05,079 --> 00:45:05,960
Site settings.

1094
00:45:06,519 --> 00:45:09,219
I don't think...

1095
00:45:09,219 --> 00:45:10,900
Isn't it highly recommended not to do this?

1096
00:45:11,539 --> 00:45:19,380
Not yet.

1097
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:19,699
Okay.

1098
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:22,019
Site settings.

1099
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:24,139
Uh...

1100
00:45:24,139 --> 00:45:24,699
Flash.

1101
00:45:24,699 --> 00:45:26,940
Block sites from using flash.

1102
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:28,219
Okay, we're going to allow.

1103
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,579
Ask first is what it says.

1104
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:39,719
I can't even allow it.

1105
00:45:39,719 --> 00:45:41,239
I have to do ask first.

1106
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:46,920
Okay.

1107
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,599
Well, let's have to reboot it.

1108
00:45:49,239 --> 00:45:53,659
Okay.

1109
00:45:53,659 --> 00:45:55,260
Run flash this time.

1110
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:55,500
Okay.

1111
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,380
Did it work?

1112
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:01,690
I don't think it did.

1113
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:03,510
Oh shit.

1114
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:03,989
What happened?

1115
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:06,309
What happened?

1116
00:46:06,309 --> 00:46:06,710
Already?

1117
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:07,829
Did I get hacked already?

1118
00:46:07,829 --> 00:46:08,389
What happened?

1119
00:46:08,949 --> 00:46:13,849
I turned...

1120
00:46:13,849 --> 00:46:16,170
I turned on flash and I get a notification.

1121
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:17,769
They really don't want you to turn this on.

1122
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:20,969
They desperately do not want you to turn this on.

1123
00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:23,449
Flash player will no longer be supported.

1124
00:46:23,449 --> 00:46:24,010
Turn it off.

1125
00:46:28,409 --> 00:46:29,449
Holy shit, man.

1126
00:46:30,010 --> 00:46:32,780
Can you see?

1127
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,480
How come I can't capture the window now?

1128
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:48,409
Oh, okay.

1129
00:46:48,409 --> 00:46:48,969
There we go.

1130
00:46:48,969 --> 00:46:49,530
That was weird.

1131
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:53,579
Okay.

1132
00:46:53,579 --> 00:46:54,059
All right.

1133
00:46:54,059 --> 00:46:56,219
So this is the only level.

1134
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:58,650
This game...

1135
00:46:58,650 --> 00:46:59,530
Flash is blocked.

1136
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:01,159
It's not.

1137
00:47:01,159 --> 00:47:02,039
I just unblocked it.

1138
00:47:04,949 --> 00:47:05,909
I don't think I can play this.

1139
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,039
Click it.

1140
00:47:22,679 --> 00:47:23,079
Click.

1141
00:47:24,329 --> 00:47:24,969
I...

1142
00:47:24,969 --> 00:47:26,090
Look, I don't use...

1143
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:27,449
I never really use Chrome.

1144
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:29,369
I'm a Firefox guy.

1145
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:32,019
There's only one level.

1146
00:47:32,019 --> 00:47:32,579
Okay, play it.

1147
00:47:33,139 --> 00:47:37,539
That's based...

1148
00:47:37,539 --> 00:47:38,179
Of course it is.

1149
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:40,070
Why would you use Chrome?

1150
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:41,750
It uses like 40% CPU.

1151
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:45,429
Mozilla's got like quantum tech...

1152
00:47:45,429 --> 00:47:48,070
Mozilla has quantum technology.

1153
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:49,110
I've read that.

1154
00:47:49,110 --> 00:47:51,989
Did you read that about Mozilla quantum?

1155
00:47:51,989 --> 00:47:53,269
Firefox quantum?

1156
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:58,380
Yes, I'm aware that that's just like

1157
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:01,260
infomercial speak of like new and improved.

1158
00:48:02,139 --> 00:48:03,420
It's just soap and water.

1159
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:03,980
I know.

1160
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:06,059
But like they say, the new technology.

1161
00:48:06,059 --> 00:48:07,820
The new soap bubble technology.

1162
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:08,940
I get it.

1163
00:48:10,809 --> 00:48:12,170
Play or continue level one.

1164
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,239
I have a web timer?

1165
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:15,800
Hold on.

1166
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:16,599
I gotta zoom this in.

1167
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:21,210
Why do I feel like I've played this game before?

1168
00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:26,679
Does the timer matter?

1169
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:33,559
Okay.

1170
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:35,670
Arrow keys.

1171
00:48:36,389 --> 00:48:43,539
All right.

1172
00:48:43,539 --> 00:48:44,260
Stage complete.

1173
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:45,699
But this is the level over.

1174
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:49,800
Okay.

1175
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,639
So they made my controls backwards.

1176
00:48:51,639 --> 00:48:53,880
I remember this game from like 2001.

1177
00:48:56,409 --> 00:48:57,690
Think before doing.

1178
00:48:57,690 --> 00:48:58,650
I remember this game.

1179
00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:00,730
This is one of those original like troll games.

1180
00:49:07,659 --> 00:49:08,860
Alternate control scheme.

1181
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:12,320
What?

1182
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:18,840
Mouse?

1183
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:19,800
Oh, okay.

1184
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:23,619
Get in.

1185
00:49:23,619 --> 00:49:26,659
This is like the impossible quiz

1186
00:49:26,659 --> 00:49:29,139
where you had to memorize every single answer.

1187
00:49:32,539 --> 00:49:33,420
Free floating.

1188
00:49:34,059 --> 00:49:40,250
It's a legendary game.

1189
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:41,289
Yeah, it's a bit bouncy.

1190
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:43,059
But okay.

1191
00:49:43,059 --> 00:49:43,559
I get it.

1192
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:51,179
This is not like the impossible quiz.

1193
00:49:51,179 --> 00:49:52,780
Yeah, but it was the same time frame.

1194
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:54,219
Wait, I can jump?

1195
00:49:55,019 --> 00:49:55,519
Oh.

1196
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:58,500
These all came out like around the same time.

1197
00:49:59,219 --> 00:50:02,519
With the impossible quiz today.

1198
00:50:02,519 --> 00:50:03,400
You know what's really funny?

1199
00:50:04,119 --> 00:50:05,719
I probably have still...

1200
00:50:05,719 --> 00:50:07,559
I played that game so often when I was younger.

1201
00:50:07,559 --> 00:50:09,400
I think I probably have memorized

1202
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:10,440
a shitload of those answers.

1203
00:50:12,730 --> 00:50:14,010
Handy stripes of doom.

1204
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:17,219
Okay, so don't touch pink.

1205
00:50:17,219 --> 00:50:18,099
Okay, don't touch pink.

1206
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:19,860
How do I...

1207
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:26,059
Oh, fuck.

1208
00:50:26,059 --> 00:50:26,380
Hold on.

1209
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,380
How am I supposed to...

1210
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:28,940
How do I get up there?

1211
00:50:29,579 --> 00:50:35,750
A hundred million off the dead

1212
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:36,949
if you can do the impossible quiz.

1213
00:50:38,699 --> 00:50:41,179
I think I remember most of the answers.

1214
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:47,510
Arrow control?

1215
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:50,409
Oh, shit.

1216
00:50:50,409 --> 00:50:50,909
Hold on.

1217
00:50:57,780 --> 00:50:58,980
You know when you go to your friend's house

1218
00:50:58,980 --> 00:50:59,940
and they've got a fucking crazy...

1219
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:00,420
He hits it out.

1220
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:08,579
Okay, then do it.

1221
00:51:08,579 --> 00:51:09,139
I have to click.

1222
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:16,920
Heavy headwind here.

1223
00:51:17,639 --> 00:51:21,239
Look at how fun this is.

1224
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:22,599
Remember when...

1225
00:51:22,599 --> 00:51:23,960
Oh, dude, remember when video games

1226
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:24,920
were so much better?

1227
00:51:25,639 --> 00:51:28,619
So much time and passion went into it.

1228
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:37,579
This ain't even boomer.

1229
00:51:37,579 --> 00:51:38,139
What are you talking about?

1230
00:51:38,139 --> 00:51:39,980
This is millennial.

1231
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:42,340
This game came out when I was probably 14.

1232
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:43,619
15 or something.

1233
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:51,429
Got a raid?

1234
00:51:51,989 --> 00:51:52,860
We're raided.

1235
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:54,250
We're raided.

1236
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:54,650
We got a raid?

1237
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:55,289
Did we get a raid?

1238
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:57,030
Oh, shit.

1239
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:58,309
It's Kit Vogan.

1240
00:51:59,349 --> 00:52:00,309
Kit Vogan raid.

1241
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:03,500
I got to sing the raid song.

1242
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:07,840
Hey.

1243
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:10,360
Thank you for the raid.

1244
00:52:11,159 --> 00:52:13,239
Well, I'm doing it to this song in the background.

1245
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:17,829
Thanks, Kit.

1246
00:52:17,829 --> 00:52:19,030
I hope you had a good stream today.

1247
00:52:21,719 --> 00:52:22,760
Hope you had a good stream.

1248
00:52:23,989 --> 00:52:24,710
Welcome everybody.

1249
00:52:25,269 --> 00:52:27,000
We're currently just doing flash games

1250
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:27,960
and chilling for a little bit.

1251
00:52:32,099 --> 00:52:35,059
I actually saw a pretty funny Kit Vogan clip recently

1252
00:52:35,059 --> 00:52:38,579
and when he was talking to a scammer

1253
00:52:38,579 --> 00:52:40,179
that didn't believe he was him.

1254
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:42,150
This scammer was like,

1255
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:43,670
yeah, I'm a big fan of Kit Vogan.

1256
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:44,230
It's not you.

1257
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:45,909
He's like, okay.

1258
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:49,590
He's like, maybe one day you'll get to talk to him.

1259
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:52,150
And the guy's like, yeah, maybe.

1260
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:53,110
It's not you, though.

1261
00:52:53,829 --> 00:52:59,050
But welcome, guys.

1262
00:52:59,690 --> 00:53:00,630
Thanks for the raid.

1263
00:53:02,170 --> 00:53:03,610
One, I could only jump once.

1264
00:53:05,159 --> 00:53:06,519
Yeah, we're currently playing games that,

1265
00:53:06,519 --> 00:53:07,880
you know, you look back and you go like, man.

1266
00:53:09,079 --> 00:53:11,000
Back when people made games like Passion,

1267
00:53:11,719 --> 00:53:16,809
like Super Mario, Super Mario 2, Super Mario 3.

1268
00:53:17,769 --> 00:53:19,210
The impossible game.

1269
00:53:19,929 --> 00:53:21,539
Time to refresh.

1270
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:35,030
I mean, what?

1271
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:43,539
I have to actually hit F5?

1272
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:45,340
No, you don't.

1273
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:47,590
But is it going to count though?

1274
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:49,349
Because Flash Player is like dead and broken.

1275
00:53:49,349 --> 00:53:49,989
Will it remember?

1276
00:54:00,579 --> 00:54:04,980
Uh, okay.

1277
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:09,769
Welcome to the channel.

1278
00:54:09,769 --> 00:54:13,530
Thank you Kit Vogan for that sweet ass raid.

1279
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:23,239
That was a bad one.

1280
00:54:23,239 --> 00:54:23,960
That was a good one,

1281
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,239
but it was a bad one at the same time.

1282
00:54:25,239 --> 00:54:28,039
Why am I at level one?

1283
00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:33,369
I was like, that was yikes.

1284
00:54:34,579 --> 00:54:36,260
Oh, what happened?

1285
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:36,980
Did I get baited?

1286
00:54:41,099 --> 00:54:43,179
Oh, for that sweet ass raid.

1287
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:49,340
No, I don't want to do this whole thing again.

1288
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:50,139
Did I get fooled?

1289
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:52,699
Do an impossible quiz.

1290
00:54:52,699 --> 00:54:53,820
No, let me get past that.

1291
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:54,539
Let me do this first.

1292
00:54:54,539 --> 00:54:55,099
I'll do this quick.

1293
00:54:55,099 --> 00:54:55,820
Think before doing.

1294
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:01,300
Turn on cookies.

1295
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:06,920
Am I going to turn cookies on?

1296
00:55:07,559 --> 00:55:14,139
Possible quiz.

1297
00:55:14,139 --> 00:55:15,980
I will do the impossible quiz, I promise.

1298
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:17,500
By the end of the stream today,

1299
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:20,300
I will have completed the impossible quiz.

1300
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:23,940
Okay, you understand?

1301
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,639
At least, hold on, let me make this.

1302
00:55:27,639 --> 00:55:29,559
I know people are calling me a liar and that's fine.

1303
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:33,340
At least the first 50 levels, okay?

1304
00:55:34,059 --> 00:55:35,900
I will get to level 50.

1305
00:55:38,679 --> 00:55:40,280
I know there's like 125 levels,

1306
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:41,880
but I'll get to at least level 50.

1307
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:48,019
Moving a goal post, that's fine.

1308
00:55:48,019 --> 00:55:49,219
I'll continue to do so.

1309
00:55:49,219 --> 00:55:52,260
What's that singing?

1310
00:55:59,019 --> 00:56:02,230
You said you'd beat it.

1311
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:05,219
Oh, come on.

1312
00:56:05,219 --> 00:56:05,780
What the fuck?

1313
00:56:14,139 --> 00:56:14,780
I'm going to...

1314
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:15,900
This is all going on YouTube, guys.

1315
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:22,409
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

1316
00:56:25,079 --> 00:56:27,400
And then what's going to happen is whenever I do...

1317
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,079
Whenever I get really close to dying,

1318
00:56:29,079 --> 00:56:30,840
the camera is going to zoom the fuck in

1319
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:31,960
right at when I fall down, right there.

1320
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:32,920
It's like a one second cut.

1321
00:56:34,039 --> 00:56:35,639
Like, no, no, no, no, I got it, I got it, I got it.

1322
00:56:36,199 --> 00:56:36,440
No.

1323
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,119
Oh, I mean...

1324
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:39,239
No.

1325
00:56:39,239 --> 00:56:40,039
Oh, there we go.

1326
00:56:40,599 --> 00:56:41,960
It's going to zoom, wick-a-ding, wick-a-close.

1327
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:43,960
And it's going to zoom, wick-a-close to my face.

1328
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:44,679
I'm going to be going like this.

1329
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:47,179
I don't...

1330
00:56:47,179 --> 00:56:47,900
Don't use that.

1331
00:56:48,539 --> 00:57:05,940
Perfect dog cam today.

1332
00:57:15,079 --> 00:57:16,039
Air pet him, all right.

1333
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:20,780
Otto!

1334
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:22,420
Otto!

1335
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:24,889
Who's a good dog, Otto?

1336
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:28,550
Move.

1337
00:57:28,550 --> 00:57:29,110
I'm...

1338
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:29,750
How's my hair?

1339
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:42,199
It's there.

1340
00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:52,010
It's there.

1341
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:56,969
You've got to press it on you.

1342
00:57:58,090 --> 00:58:02,889
I guess again that's what you do, baby.

1343
00:58:03,769 --> 00:58:06,059
Hold it down.

1344
00:58:06,059 --> 00:58:06,559
There.

1345
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:17,400
In DMCA me, well, that means I did a good job.

1346
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:17,880
So go ahead.

1347
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:28,579
It's there.

1348
00:58:29,219 --> 00:58:30,630
It's a great song.

1349
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:42,380
No returns, no refunds.

1350
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:46,650
It's coming up.

1351
00:58:46,650 --> 00:58:47,610
It's coming up.

1352
00:58:47,610 --> 00:58:48,570
It's coming up.

1353
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:49,769
It's coming up.

1354
00:58:49,769 --> 00:58:50,650
It's there.

1355
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:55,019
Left, right, march.

1356
00:59:07,079 --> 00:59:08,679
I actually haven't heard the new Gorillaz album.

1357
00:59:08,679 --> 00:59:09,159
I really haven't.

1358
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:13,239
It's kind of bad.

1359
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:14,920
I love that, man.

1360
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,119
Stop playing this trash.

1361
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:16,599
I will.

1362
00:59:16,599 --> 00:59:17,639
Okay, time to refresh.

1363
00:59:18,519 --> 00:59:20,760
Why though?

1364
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:21,559
Why is it doing this?

1365
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:26,409
Enter refresh.

1366
00:59:27,050 --> 00:59:28,329
I'm not pressing F5 again.

1367
00:59:28,969 --> 00:59:31,019
You have to enable cookies.

1368
00:59:31,659 --> 00:59:31,980
Is that...

1369
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:34,840
Cookies are enabled.

1370
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:43,829
Turn on cookies and refresh.

1371
00:59:43,829 --> 00:59:44,550
They're on.

1372
00:59:45,269 --> 00:59:48,630
All right.

1373
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:49,190
Give me the...

1374
00:59:49,190 --> 00:59:49,510
Let's go.

1375
00:59:49,510 --> 00:59:50,469
I'm doing impossible quiz.

1376
00:59:50,469 --> 00:59:51,510
That one was fun.

1377
00:59:51,510 --> 00:59:55,639
Impossible ball.

1378
00:59:55,639 --> 00:59:56,280
Well, that's not it.

1379
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:57,079
Where's impossible quiz?

1380
00:59:57,079 --> 00:59:57,880
Is it on congregate?

1381
01:00:02,789 --> 01:00:03,190
Oh, there it is.

1382
01:00:03,190 --> 01:00:04,070
Impossible quiz.

1383
01:00:04,949 --> 01:00:06,150
Wait, impossible game?

1384
01:00:06,789 --> 01:00:13,880
Enabling flash.

1385
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:14,360
Hello, players.

1386
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,519
The latest version of Chrome includes enhanced security.

1387
01:00:16,519 --> 01:00:18,199
It must be configured to allow flash.

1388
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:19,480
Oh, God.

1389
01:00:20,119 --> 01:00:21,860
Okay.

1390
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:25,139
Use the supernova plugin as an easy way to enable.

1391
01:00:26,099 --> 01:00:27,380
It's already installed, isn't it?

1392
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:28,659
Go get flash player.

1393
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:32,139
Do it.

1394
01:00:32,139 --> 01:00:32,699
Click the link.

1395
01:00:32,699 --> 01:00:33,260
I'm afraid.

1396
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:33,900
I'm like afraid.

1397
01:00:34,619 --> 01:00:36,809
I'm afraid to click the link.

1398
01:00:36,809 --> 01:00:37,449
I don't think I'm...

1399
01:00:37,449 --> 01:00:37,929
Hold on.

1400
01:00:37,929 --> 01:00:38,429
What's this?

1401
01:00:42,869 --> 01:00:43,909
Zorn lovers?

1402
01:00:43,909 --> 01:00:45,190
I'm only five miles away.

1403
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:49,639
All right.

1404
01:00:49,639 --> 01:00:51,239
It took me a second to realize what this was.

1405
01:00:51,239 --> 01:00:52,679
And then it was very funny.

1406
01:00:55,079 --> 01:01:00,940
Hold on.

1407
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:01,420
Let's get it.

1408
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:14,059
Okay.

1409
01:01:14,059 --> 01:01:15,340
We're going to enable it, I guess.

1410
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:15,980
Is it going to work?

1411
01:01:16,539 --> 01:01:22,090
I think it worked.

1412
01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:22,650
Did it work?

1413
01:01:23,210 --> 01:01:25,260
It's not loading it though.

1414
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:31,059
It's blank.

1415
01:01:31,059 --> 01:01:32,619
Hold on.

1416
01:01:32,619 --> 01:01:33,420
Let me try to refresh.

1417
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:35,260
Refresh.

1418
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:39,480
Come on.

1419
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:42,809
Is there another one?

1420
01:01:42,809 --> 01:01:42,969
Wait.

1421
01:01:42,969 --> 01:01:43,530
There's another one.

1422
01:01:43,530 --> 01:01:44,809
Impossible quiz dot...

1423
01:01:44,809 --> 01:01:45,690
Is that a good one?

1424
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:47,130
Is this a real website?

1425
01:01:47,130 --> 01:01:48,650
Or did you just fucking type this in and make it up?

1426
01:01:51,559 --> 01:01:52,599
Oh, this feels like a fake.

1427
01:01:52,599 --> 01:01:54,039
This doesn't feel like a real website to me.

1428
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:58,389
It's real.

1429
01:01:58,389 --> 01:01:58,789
It's real.

1430
01:01:58,789 --> 01:01:58,949
Okay.

1431
01:01:58,949 --> 01:01:59,590
All right.

1432
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:00,869
This website uses cookies.

1433
01:02:00,869 --> 01:02:01,269
Eat them.

1434
01:02:09,079 --> 01:02:10,360
I'm five miles away.

1435
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:11,480
I love to chat.

1436
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:17,269
Can I get rid of these ads though?

1437
01:02:17,269 --> 01:02:17,989
Like really?

1438
01:02:18,710 --> 01:02:22,860
What the fuck just happened?

1439
01:02:24,059 --> 01:02:25,340
I just clicked an ad.

1440
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:26,699
This was an ad.

1441
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:33,619
You suck.

1442
01:02:34,179 --> 01:02:36,659
The game's taking impossibly long to load, but it'll be worth it.

1443
01:02:36,659 --> 01:02:37,860
Oh, it's part of the joke.

1444
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:41,219
What the fuck?

1445
01:02:41,219 --> 01:02:42,500
I just clicked the ad again.

1446
01:02:49,989 --> 01:02:50,469
Hurry up.

1447
01:02:51,349 --> 01:02:51,829
I want to get...

1448
01:02:51,829 --> 01:02:52,230
Hold on.

1449
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:52,789
Get rid of this.

1450
01:02:52,789 --> 01:02:53,750
I'm not going to let this...

1451
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:54,710
I'm not going to stand for this.

1452
01:02:56,119 --> 01:02:56,679
I'm not going to...

1453
01:02:56,679 --> 01:02:57,719
I'm not going to stand for this.

1454
01:02:58,920 --> 01:02:59,320
I'm sorry.

1455
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:00,519
That's not going to happen.

1456
01:03:00,519 --> 01:03:05,380
Wait a minute.

1457
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:06,260
What's that slot machine?

1458
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:15,219
Okay.

1459
01:03:15,219 --> 01:03:17,219
Oh my fucking god, Jeremy.

1460
01:03:17,780 --> 01:03:19,619
I just gave this website...

1461
01:03:19,619 --> 01:03:21,539
Like why is this doing this?

1462
01:03:30,039 --> 01:03:31,320
Play the Zorn game.

1463
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:32,840
I'm on the impossible quiz.

1464
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:33,880
Why is this doing this?

1465
01:03:40,219 --> 01:03:41,659
I didn't even click anything.

1466
01:03:41,659 --> 01:03:42,860
I highlighted text.

1467
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:47,619
Stop.

1468
01:03:47,619 --> 01:03:48,340
I'm trying to get...

1469
01:03:50,730 --> 01:03:52,090
My fucking god.

1470
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:54,179
Okay.

1471
01:03:54,179 --> 01:03:54,980
We're finally done.

1472
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:55,619
We're finally done.

1473
01:03:55,619 --> 01:03:56,420
We're ready.

1474
01:03:56,420 --> 01:03:56,900
I'm going to...

1475
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:58,739
I remember half of these answers.

1476
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:00,820
I remember half of these answers.

1477
01:04:05,909 --> 01:04:06,150
All right.

1478
01:04:06,150 --> 01:04:06,949
Impossible quiz.

1479
01:04:06,949 --> 01:04:07,429
I remember.

1480
01:04:07,429 --> 01:04:07,750
Let's go.

1481
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:08,949
Let's see how many I remember.

1482
01:04:08,949 --> 01:04:09,510
Are you ready?

1483
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:11,860
It's time.

1484
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:13,780
Let's see if I can remember these.

1485
01:04:14,659 --> 01:04:16,760
How many holes in polo?

1486
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:17,800
That's two because they're actually...

1487
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,000
They're talking about the word polo.

1488
01:04:19,719 --> 01:04:20,280
No, they're not.

1489
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:20,760
No, they're not.

1490
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:21,079
I forgot.

1491
01:04:21,079 --> 01:04:21,800
I missed it already.

1492
01:04:22,679 --> 01:04:23,559
How many holes in a polo?

1493
01:04:23,559 --> 01:04:24,440
One because it's a t-shirt.

1494
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:25,719
Okay.

1495
01:04:25,719 --> 01:04:26,280
That's wrong.

1496
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:29,739
What?

1497
01:04:29,739 --> 01:04:31,019
Four because it's polo.

1498
01:04:31,019 --> 01:04:31,420
The word.

1499
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:31,739
Okay.

1500
01:04:32,539 --> 01:04:33,420
Can a match box?

1501
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:34,460
No, but a tin can.

1502
01:04:36,730 --> 01:04:37,369
K.O.

1503
01:04:38,010 --> 01:04:39,050
Click the answer.

1504
01:04:39,050 --> 01:04:39,769
It's the answer.

1505
01:04:39,769 --> 01:04:41,130
Put the mouse on here.

1506
01:04:41,130 --> 01:04:42,250
Now don't touch the blue.

1507
01:04:42,250 --> 01:04:42,809
Sure thing.

1508
01:04:42,809 --> 01:04:44,230
I won't.

1509
01:04:44,230 --> 01:04:44,869
Onion.

1510
01:04:44,869 --> 01:04:45,750
That would be shallots.

1511
01:04:46,309 --> 01:04:48,469
The answer is really big.

1512
01:04:48,469 --> 01:04:49,030
An elephant.

1513
01:04:49,670 --> 01:04:50,550
Search for it.

1514
01:04:50,550 --> 01:04:51,929
It's not there.

1515
01:04:51,929 --> 01:04:52,789
It's not there.

1516
01:04:52,789 --> 01:04:53,349
It's right there.

1517
01:04:53,909 --> 01:04:55,269
What was the answer to question two?

1518
01:04:55,269 --> 01:04:55,829
It would be that one.

1519
01:04:56,389 --> 01:04:57,190
Choose the food.

1520
01:04:57,190 --> 01:04:59,110
It's the teeth.

1521
01:04:59,110 --> 01:05:00,869
What follows December 2nd?

1522
01:05:00,869 --> 01:05:02,840
That would be N.

1523
01:05:04,019 --> 01:05:05,139
Click the smallest.

1524
01:05:05,139 --> 01:05:06,099
It's this one.

1525
01:05:06,099 --> 01:05:08,739
It's this one.

1526
01:05:08,739 --> 01:05:10,179
What sound does a bell make?

1527
01:05:10,179 --> 01:05:10,659
Fatang.

1528
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:13,300
What can you put in a bucket to make it lighter?

1529
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:16,400
A hole.

1530
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:19,289
I got kind of close though.

1531
01:05:19,289 --> 01:05:20,010
I could do it.

1532
01:05:20,010 --> 01:05:21,050
How many holes in a polo?

1533
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:21,449
That'd be four.

1534
01:05:21,449 --> 01:05:22,090
Where's the music?

1535
01:05:22,809 --> 01:05:24,010
Isn't there usually music?

1536
01:05:24,010 --> 01:05:28,730
Where's the sounds?

1537
01:05:28,730 --> 01:05:31,260
Okay, how many holes in a polo?

1538
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:31,900
Four.

1539
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:33,579
Can a matchbox know what it's in can?

1540
01:05:33,579 --> 01:05:34,780
That's a KO.

1541
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:36,179
Click the answer.

1542
01:05:36,179 --> 01:05:37,610
Mouse over here.

1543
01:05:37,610 --> 01:05:38,730
Next question, please.

1544
01:05:38,730 --> 01:05:39,449
Shallots.

1545
01:05:39,449 --> 01:05:40,170
The answer is really big.

1546
01:05:40,170 --> 01:05:41,050
It's an elephant.

1547
01:05:41,050 --> 01:05:42,250
Search for it right here.

1548
01:05:42,250 --> 01:05:42,889
What was the answer?

1549
01:05:42,889 --> 01:05:43,610
This one.

1550
01:05:43,610 --> 01:05:45,349
Teeth.

1551
01:05:45,349 --> 01:05:46,070
Uh, N.

1552
01:05:46,070 --> 01:05:47,510
Click the smallest.

1553
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:49,989
What sound does a bell make?

1554
01:05:49,989 --> 01:05:50,869
Fatang.

1555
01:05:50,869 --> 01:05:52,869
What can you put in a bucket to make it lighter?

1556
01:05:52,869 --> 01:05:54,039
Torch.

1557
01:05:54,039 --> 01:05:58,730
Oh, this would be horse.

1558
01:05:58,730 --> 01:06:01,340
What is the seventh letter of the alphabet?

1559
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:03,099
A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

1560
01:06:03,099 --> 01:06:04,699
It's G, but it's probably not G.

1561
01:06:04,699 --> 01:06:07,340
It is A, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

1562
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:10,139
It would be the letter E.

1563
01:06:10,139 --> 01:06:14,059
One, two, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, H.

1564
01:06:14,059 --> 01:06:16,630
24 minus seven equals?

1565
01:06:16,630 --> 01:06:21,849
That would be 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17.

1566
01:06:23,050 --> 01:06:26,739
Um, it's not, I, this is, no, it's a trick.

1567
01:06:26,739 --> 01:06:28,250
There it is.

1568
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:30,420
Stop.

1569
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:32,019
I believe the answer is banana.

1570
01:06:34,179 --> 01:06:34,900
It's hammer.

1571
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:37,289
Uh, color in the correct order.

1572
01:06:37,289 --> 01:06:41,619
That would be blue, orange, green, green, yellow.

1573
01:06:41,619 --> 01:06:42,260
Masterpiece.

1574
01:06:42,260 --> 01:06:43,340
Thank you.

1575
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:44,300
Deal or no deal?

1576
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:45,940
No deal.

1577
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:46,260
No.

1578
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:47,619
Yeah, no, it was deal.

1579
01:06:47,619 --> 01:06:49,480
I forget.

1580
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:52,090
I think it was no seal.

1581
01:06:52,090 --> 01:06:53,369
Watch carefully.

1582
01:06:53,369 --> 01:06:58,739
The choice is yours.

1583
01:06:58,739 --> 01:07:02,659
I would like plus one skip.

1584
01:07:02,659 --> 01:07:04,739
Save changes to untitled.

1585
01:07:04,739 --> 01:07:05,239
No.

1586
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:06,579
Cancel.

1587
01:07:06,579 --> 01:07:09,579
All right, I got it, I got it, four.

1588
01:07:09,579 --> 01:07:11,420
Get a matchbox if I can.

1589
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:12,059

01:07:12,619 --> 01:07:13,900
Uh, click the answer.

1594
01:07:18,010 --> 01:07:19,539
Go ahead.

1595
01:07:19,539 --> 01:07:20,260
Uh, elephant.

1596
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:22,059

01:07:23,019 --> 01:07:24,679

Batang.

1602
01:07:28,550 --> 01:07:29,590
It's a torch.

1603
01:07:29,590 --> 01:07:30,389
That's a horse.

1604
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:37,179
Uh, the seventh letter of the alphabet was, um, wait, it was H.

1605
01:07:37,179 --> 01:07:37,820
Seventeen.

1606
01:07:38,380 --> 01:07:39,480
Hammer.

1607
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:43,239
Blue, orange, blue, green, green, yellow.

1608
01:07:43,239 --> 01:07:43,800
Good.

1609
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:45,980
Deal or no deal?

1610
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:47,380
Seal.

1611
01:07:47,380 --> 01:07:48,019
Watch carefully.

1612
01:07:48,019 --> 01:07:48,900
It's this one.

1613
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:50,469
Plus one skip.

01:07:53,139 --> 01:07:53,780
Okay.

1617
01:07:53,780 --> 01:07:56,659
I know how to do this one.

1618
01:07:56,659 --> 01:07:58,469
Click.

1619
01:07:58,469 --> 01:08:02,460
Click the lives button.

1620
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:05,260
How do you kill a werewolf?

1622
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:14,070
Which of these places names doesn't exist?

1623
01:08:14,070 --> 01:08:18,970
Oh, I don't, I think it's arse facey.

1624
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:21,210
Okay, I hope you've been paying attention to the questions.

1625
01:08:21,210 --> 01:08:22,729
Numbers go to 21.

1626
01:08:23,369 --> 01:08:24,250
Go to 24.

1627
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:25,670
It's go to 26.

1628
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:27,829

Arse facey.

1630
01:08:28,710 --> 01:08:30,460
Go to 28.

1631
01:08:30,460 --> 01:08:31,100
What is this?

1632
01:08:31,659 --> 01:08:33,420
That would be abundance.

1633
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:35,420
What flavor is cardboard?

1634
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:40,649

Fuck.

1637
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:45,399
Egg mayonnaise.

1638
01:08:45,399 --> 01:08:47,130
Okay, put the mouse here.

1639
01:08:47,130 --> 01:08:49,909
Be careful.

1640
01:08:49,909 --> 01:08:50,630
Woof.

1641
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:53,060
I believe this is woof woof woof.

1642
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:56,170

01:08:56,170 --> 01:09:01,050
Uh, rocks and saucers.

1644
01:09:01,050 --> 01:09:02,659
Nope.

1645
01:09:02,659 --> 01:09:03,460
Baby Cham.

1646
01:09:03,460 --> 01:09:03,939
Okay.

One, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

1649
01:09:13,029 --> 01:09:17,500
There's nine there, but that's not what they're asking.

1650
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:20,470
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

1651
01:09:20,470 --> 01:09:22,619
Elephants don't like mice.

1652
01:09:22,619 --> 01:09:23,180
They don't.

1653
01:09:23,180 --> 01:09:28,649
So get it off the screen so they can move in.

1654
01:09:28,649 --> 01:09:29,369
Read chat.

1655
01:09:29,369 --> 01:09:30,170
What?

1656
01:09:30,170 --> 01:09:33,319
If you press this button, it's game over.

1657
01:09:33,319 --> 01:09:34,199
Right.

1658
01:09:34,199 --> 01:09:37,079
Alternatively, click this one to carry on.

1659
01:09:37,079 --> 01:09:39,800

01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:43,060
Shit.

1662
01:09:43,060 --> 01:09:47,399
What are you guys saying?

1663
01:09:47,399 --> 01:09:48,760
It doesn't need to read chat.

1664
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:54,739
No, I'm trying to do this on my own.

1665
01:09:54,739 --> 01:09:55,619
Heyo.

1666
01:09:55,619 --> 01:09:56,659
Click the answer.

1667
01:09:56,659 --> 01:09:59,020
I told you I knew half of these already.

1668
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:02,520
I played this so many times when I was younger.

1669
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:03,079
That one.

1670
01:10:03,079 --> 01:10:03,479
Teeth.

1671
01:10:04,439 --> 01:10:05,000
This one.

1672
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,039
Whoa, don't do that.

1673
01:10:06,039 --> 01:10:10,140
Don't right click.

1674
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:10,699
Tang.

1675
01:10:10,699 --> 01:10:11,260
A torch.

1676
01:10:12,439 --> 01:10:13,000
Horus.

1677
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:15,029
H.

1678
01:10:15,899 --> 01:10:16,699
Seventeen.

1679
01:10:16,699 --> 01:10:17,979
The hammer.

1680
01:10:17,979 --> 01:10:19,899
Blue, orange, green, green, yellow.

1681
01:10:19,899 --> 01:10:20,300
Go ahead.

1682
01:10:20,859 --> 01:10:21,340
Seal.

1683
01:10:22,710 --> 01:10:23,750
It's this one.

1684
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:25,220
Fuzz a skip.

1685
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:25,619
Ran.

1686
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:26,819
Click the V.

1687
01:10:29,939 --> 01:10:31,159
It's shoe polish, right?

1688
01:10:31,159 --> 01:10:32,039
Yeah, okay.

1689
01:10:32,039 --> 01:10:32,279
R.

1690
01:10:32,279 --> 01:10:33,079
Spacey.

1691
01:10:33,079 --> 01:10:34,199
Go to 28.

1692
01:10:34,199 --> 01:10:35,479
That's abundance.

1693
01:10:35,479 --> 01:10:36,840
It was egg mayonnaise.

1694
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:37,560
Start here.

1695
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:38,359
Be careful.

1696
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:38,920
Good.

1697
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:40,039
Woof, woof, woof.

1698
01:10:40,039 --> 01:10:41,000
Baby Cham.

1699
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:42,439
Seven.

1700
01:10:42,439 --> 01:10:43,239
Watch out.

1701
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:45,750
What are you doing?

1702
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:46,390
God gamer.

1703
01:10:47,350 --> 01:10:48,630
Boomer reliving his youth.

1704
01:10:48,630 --> 01:10:49,750
What are you linking here?

1705
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:52,039
Put it in E mode only?

1706
01:10:54,579 --> 01:10:56,260
You lost 2,000 viewers.

1707
01:10:57,060 --> 01:10:57,539
Whatever.

1708
01:10:57,539 --> 01:10:58,260
I don't care.

1709
01:10:58,260 --> 01:10:59,640
Okay, I gotta get this right.

1710
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:00,520
I'm on 36.

1711
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:05,699
A walk, I think.

1712
01:11:05,699 --> 01:11:08,329
Okay.

1713
01:11:08,329 --> 01:11:10,729
Can you get this question wrong?

1714
01:11:10,729 --> 01:11:11,210
No way.

1715
01:11:12,069 --> 01:11:13,909
Mary Rose sat on a pin.

1716
01:11:18,710 --> 01:11:19,460
I think it's-

1717
01:11:19,460 --> 01:11:20,020
Oh, really?

1718
01:11:20,579 --> 01:11:21,779
No, it's not.

1719
01:11:21,779 --> 01:11:28,390
First her piles?

1720
01:11:28,949 --> 01:11:29,590
Mary Rose.

1721
01:11:29,590 --> 01:11:30,149
Okay.

1722
01:11:30,149 --> 01:11:32,329
Right here, right now.

1723
01:11:32,329 --> 01:11:32,970
Space here.

1724
01:11:32,970 --> 01:11:33,529
Cough drops.

1725
01:11:33,529 --> 01:11:34,729
Cylindrical adventures.

1726
01:11:35,449 --> 01:11:36,409
I don't remember.

1727
01:11:36,409 --> 01:11:38,869
Cough drops.

1728
01:11:39,350 --> 01:11:39,829
Nope.

1729
01:11:39,829 --> 01:11:44,119
Shit.

1730
01:11:44,119 --> 01:11:44,680
I don't remember.

1731
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:45,319
I think it's adventures.

1732
01:11:45,319 --> 01:11:45,560
Yep.

1733
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:46,680
Put the mouse here.

1734
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:47,479
Don't touch pink.

1735
01:11:47,479 --> 01:11:50,409
Hmm, I've only had a bridge.

1736
01:11:50,409 --> 01:11:52,409
Uh, wait.

1737
01:11:52,409 --> 01:11:53,609
How do I do this one?

1738
01:11:53,609 --> 01:11:55,510
How do you do this one?

1739
01:11:55,510 --> 01:11:56,149
I forget.

1740
01:11:56,149 --> 01:11:57,350
Um, I've only had a bridge.

1741
01:11:57,350 --> 01:11:57,670
What's the-

1742
01:11:57,670 --> 01:11:58,229
What do I have to do?

1743
01:12:00,779 --> 01:12:01,260
Oh, shit.

1744
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:01,500
Right.

1745
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:02,140
I can right click.

1746
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:05,619
Wing.

1747
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:08,199
Okay.

1748
01:12:08,199 --> 01:12:10,279
Afro sexy bill.

1749
01:12:12,439 --> 01:12:13,319
Dirty rectum?

1750
01:12:13,319 --> 01:12:13,640
I think it's-

1751
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:14,039
Is it dirt?

1752
01:12:14,039 --> 01:12:14,520
No, it's-

1753
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:15,750
What is it?

1754
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:17,029
I think it's dirty rectum.

1755
01:12:17,029 --> 01:12:29,079
I don't know why I thought it was dirty rectum.

1756
01:12:29,079 --> 01:12:30,199
That was stupid of me.

1757
01:12:30,199 --> 01:12:40,409
Okay, click the smallest one.

1758
01:12:41,449 --> 01:12:42,489
That's a tang.

1759
01:12:42,489 --> 01:12:43,449
We got a torch.

1760
01:12:43,449 --> 01:12:44,489
We got a horse.

1761
01:12:45,050 --> 01:12:45,960
Very cool.

1762
01:12:48,810 --> 01:12:50,310
H-17.

1763
01:12:50,869 --> 01:12:51,350
Hammer.

1764
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:55,239
The funniest thing about this game is

1765
01:12:55,239 --> 01:12:56,279
I swear to God,

1766
01:12:56,279 --> 01:12:58,279
every like three to five years,

1767
01:12:58,279 --> 01:13:01,819
I come back and beat this game.

1768
01:13:01,819 --> 01:13:02,220
Seal.

1769
01:13:02,779 --> 01:13:08,890
I think everybody does that, right?

1770
01:13:09,529 --> 01:13:16,710
Woof, woof, woof.

1771
01:13:16,710 --> 01:13:17,350
Okay.

1772
01:13:17,350 --> 01:13:17,750
This one.

1773
01:13:18,390 --> 01:13:19,189
Seven.

1774
01:13:19,189 --> 01:13:19,670
Watch out.

1775
01:13:21,340 --> 01:13:21,819
Everybody?

1776
01:13:21,819 --> 01:13:22,699
I think a lot of people do.

1777
01:13:22,699 --> 01:13:25,560
I think at this point, yeah.

1778
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:27,079
Emote only to keep him honest.

1779
01:13:27,079 --> 01:13:28,199
You can do that if you want.

1780
01:13:28,199 --> 01:13:29,260
Keep me honest.

1781
01:13:29,260 --> 01:13:29,819
That's fine.

1782
01:13:29,819 --> 01:13:31,340
Yeah, I mean, clearly.

1783
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:33,100
You guys have to remember.

1784
01:13:33,670 --> 01:13:36,470
From the second that you see something on screen,

1785
01:13:36,470 --> 01:13:39,510
it takes about five to eight seconds before,

1786
01:13:39,510 --> 01:13:41,060
like before you see it.

1787
01:13:41,060 --> 01:13:42,100
Like when I do something,

1788
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:43,220
right now when I say,

1789
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:48,539
you probably just heard it right there.

1790
01:13:48,539 --> 01:13:50,220
So it doesn't matter.

1791
01:13:50,220 --> 01:13:51,340
I've been doing it on my own.

1792
01:13:51,340 --> 01:13:51,939
All right.

1793
01:13:51,939 --> 01:13:53,220
I want everyone to do yes

1794
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:55,619
when they hear this sound, okay?

1795
01:13:55,619 --> 01:13:56,600
We'll test it out.

1796
01:13:57,560 --> 01:14:01,619
One, two, three, four, five.

1797
01:14:01,619 --> 01:14:02,899
Okay, it's five seconds.

1798
01:14:02,899 --> 01:14:04,550
So it's five full seconds.

1799
01:14:04,550 --> 01:14:05,350
Let's try it again.

1800
01:14:05,350 --> 01:14:07,739
I want you to do Resident Sleepers.

1801
01:14:07,739 --> 01:14:08,300
No, don't do that.

1802
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:10,460
I don't want people to think this is like a boring stream.

1803
01:14:10,859 --> 01:14:14,180
Do no, okay?

1804
01:14:14,180 --> 01:14:18,069
Two, three, four, five, five.

1805
01:14:18,069 --> 01:14:19,750
Yeah, it's about five full seconds.

1806
01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:25,029
No way.

1807
01:14:25,029 --> 01:14:26,229
It's Mary Rose.

1808
01:14:26,229 --> 01:14:27,430
There we go.

1809
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:28,149
Bridge.

1810
01:14:28,149 --> 01:14:30,500
Okay, this one, what was it?

1811
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:32,500
Is it Evil Eye?

1812
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:34,659
Afro, okay.

1813
01:14:34,659 --> 01:14:37,300
What is the answer to life, the universe, and everything?

1814
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:38,500
It's 42.

1815
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:41,539
Right, but it's weird.

1816
01:14:41,539 --> 01:14:49,159
No skipping here.

1817
01:14:49,159 --> 01:14:49,720
I forget.

1818
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:52,060
There's a distinct reason.

1819
01:14:52,060 --> 01:14:54,300
I think you click on like the 40 second one.

1820
01:14:54,380 --> 01:14:54,939
Let's see.

1821
01:14:54,939 --> 01:14:58,779
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

1822
01:14:58,779 --> 01:15:02,180
Ten, 20, 30, 40, 42.

1823
01:15:02,180 --> 01:15:03,500
There it is.

1824
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:08,460
Bridget makes everyone a straight by Tom Cruise.

1825
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:10,140
I remember Tom Cruise.

1826
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:18,340
We're gonna put the piece together.

1827
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:19,060
Uh, hold on.

1828
01:15:19,619 --> 01:15:20,970
There's no timer, so don't worry.

1829
01:15:20,970 --> 01:15:21,449
It doesn't matter.

1830
01:15:22,010 --> 01:15:25,380
Does this one say cheese?

1831
01:15:26,579 --> 01:15:28,010
Cheese check?

1832
01:15:33,659 --> 01:15:40,149
Cheerios flick here.

1833
01:15:42,010 --> 01:15:42,489
Oh, right.

1834
01:15:42,489 --> 01:15:43,369
Okay, hold on.

1835
01:15:43,369 --> 01:15:48,729
I can't move this one.

1836
01:15:51,829 --> 01:15:54,380
Click here.

1837
01:15:54,380 --> 01:15:56,460
Okay, we're good.

1838
01:15:56,460 --> 01:15:57,420
Good, good, good, good, good.

1839
01:15:57,420 --> 01:16:00,779
This is Wingdings, but I don't remember which one.

1840
01:16:01,420 --> 01:16:04,899
I believe it's, uh, I don't know.

1841
01:16:04,899 --> 01:16:05,380
I have no idea.

1842
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:06,939
I have to guess top right.

1843
01:16:06,939 --> 01:16:07,819
Fucking beautiful.

1844
01:16:07,819 --> 01:16:09,449
One of the four chance.

1845
01:16:09,449 --> 01:16:10,890
Best flash, holy shit.

1846
01:16:10,890 --> 01:16:11,449
What's happening?

1847
01:16:11,449 --> 01:16:12,810
Best flash ever.

1848
01:16:12,810 --> 01:16:14,010
Man, oh my fucking God.

1849
01:16:14,010 --> 01:16:14,890
You kill Sonic.

1850
01:16:14,890 --> 01:16:15,850
You bastard.

1851
01:16:15,850 --> 01:16:16,329
It's that one.

1852
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:20,500
What is this?

1853
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:24,729
Where's my mouse?

1854
01:16:25,289 --> 01:16:31,750
Okay, snake, snake, snake.

1855
01:16:31,829 --> 01:16:33,109
Which is the correct spelling?

1856
01:16:33,109 --> 01:16:37,510
Slap-me-do, slap-me-do, spap-me-do, splap-me-do, it's slap-me-do.

1857
01:16:38,310 --> 01:16:38,869
Shit.

1858
01:16:38,869 --> 01:16:42,010
It's splap-me-do.

1859
01:16:42,010 --> 01:16:45,640
Remember, blue, red, blue, yellow.

1860
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:52,020
Uh, 108 minus 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42.

1861
01:16:52,020 --> 01:16:54,460
Blue, red, blue, yellow.

1862
01:16:54,460 --> 01:16:56,140
Remember, blue, red, blue, yellow.

1863
01:17:01,319 --> 01:17:02,810
Fuck.

1864
01:17:02,810 --> 01:17:09,909
Uh, blue, red, blue, yellow?

1865
01:17:10,550 --> 01:17:15,659
I'm gonna skip it.

1866
01:17:15,659 --> 01:17:15,979
I don't know.

1867
01:17:16,779 --> 01:17:17,279
Fight.

1868
01:17:22,060 --> 01:17:22,560
Hooray.

1869
01:17:23,939 --> 01:17:24,420
Carrot.

1870
01:17:24,420 --> 01:17:26,100
Holy shit, I guessed it correctly.

1871
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:26,739
Accidentally.

1872
01:17:26,739 --> 01:17:27,539
Okay, that's the third one.

1873
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:28,819
Marmite.

1874
01:17:28,819 --> 01:17:30,729
Uh, what is that?

1875
01:17:30,729 --> 01:17:31,050
Yum.

1876
01:17:32,229 --> 01:17:34,470
Butt-pa might not.

1877
01:17:34,470 --> 01:17:38,659
I only have one life left.

1878
01:17:38,659 --> 01:17:39,140
I don't know.

1879
01:17:39,140 --> 01:17:40,420
I can't take a chance.

1880
01:17:40,420 --> 01:17:42,840
I think it's urr.

1881
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:44,260
Depends.

1882
01:17:44,260 --> 01:17:47,029
I think it's probably yum.

1883
01:17:47,590 --> 01:17:48,149
Nope.

1884
01:17:48,149 --> 01:17:48,869
Shit, it's urr.

1885
01:17:53,590 --> 01:17:53,909
Shit.

1886
01:17:53,909 --> 01:17:54,470
Okay, whatever.

1887
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:55,829
I got it.

1888
01:17:55,829 --> 01:17:56,630
Pick the answer.

1889
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:57,510
Yeah, move over here.

1890
01:18:00,380 --> 01:18:01,420
An elephant.

1891
01:18:01,420 --> 01:18:02,060
Search for it.

1892
01:18:02,060 --> 01:18:02,539
There it is.

1893
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:03,979
That one.

1894
01:18:03,979 --> 01:18:05,909
Teeth.

1895
01:18:05,909 --> 01:18:07,189
And click the small one.

1896
01:18:07,829 --> 01:18:09,029
A tang.

1897
01:18:09,029 --> 01:18:10,710
Uh, a torch.

1898
01:18:10,710 --> 01:18:11,779
Spell it out.

1899
01:18:13,609 --> 01:18:18,779
School, H, uh, 17, blue, orange.

1900
01:18:18,779 --> 01:18:22,060
Queen, queen, yellow.

1901
01:18:22,060 --> 01:18:23,340
Oh, seeing Resonance Leapers.

1902
01:18:23,979 --> 01:18:26,060
Oh, see it, see it tomorrow when you wake up.

1903
01:18:26,060 --> 01:18:27,819
Cause I'm beating it.

1904
01:18:27,819 --> 01:18:29,989
This one.

1905
01:18:29,989 --> 01:18:30,949
This one.

1906
01:18:30,949 --> 01:18:32,970
This one.

1907
01:18:32,970 --> 01:18:34,060
This one.

1908
01:18:34,060 --> 01:18:37,180
Well, you guys should be thinking about the next game.

1909
01:18:37,180 --> 01:18:45,399
You should be thinking about the next Flash game.

1910
01:18:45,399 --> 01:18:46,199
Egg mayonnaise.

1911
01:18:46,199 --> 01:18:46,760
Here it is.

1912
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:49,220
Woof, woof, woof.

1913
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:50,340
Uh, baby.

1914
01:18:50,340 --> 01:18:52,470
Seven.

1915
01:18:52,470 --> 01:18:53,989
You guys should be thinking about the next Flash game.

1916
01:18:56,489 --> 01:18:57,689
That's only an hour.

1917
01:18:57,689 --> 01:18:58,489
I got plenty of time.

1918
01:18:58,489 --> 01:18:59,289
I'm just gonna get a water.

1919
01:18:59,289 --> 01:19:00,569
We'll get a coffee or something.

1920
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:00,970
We'll hang out.

1921
01:19:00,970 --> 01:19:01,449
Whatever.

1922
01:19:01,449 --> 01:19:01,689
What?

1923
01:19:01,689 --> 01:19:04,729
Come on.

1924
01:19:04,729 --> 01:19:05,130
Away.

1925
01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:07,659
Uh, Mary Rose.

1926
01:19:07,659 --> 01:19:09,180
This one.

1927
01:19:09,180 --> 01:19:09,739
This one.

1928
01:19:10,970 --> 01:19:11,689
Okay.

1929
01:19:11,689 --> 01:19:12,489
Afro.

1930
01:19:12,489 --> 01:19:13,449
It's 42.

1931
01:19:14,649 --> 01:19:15,050
Shit.

1932
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:16,010
It's the one below it.

1933
01:19:16,010 --> 01:19:17,609
Oh, god.

1934
01:19:17,609 --> 01:19:19,100
I'm cruise.

1935
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:20,140
Click here.

1936
01:19:20,140 --> 01:19:25,289
All right, which one is this one?

1937
01:19:25,289 --> 01:19:26,569
It's not this one.

1938
01:19:26,569 --> 01:19:28,180
We have three more chances.

1939
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:28,979
Top left.

1940
01:19:28,979 --> 01:19:30,579
That's bottom left.

1941
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:31,699
Shit.

1942
01:19:31,699 --> 01:19:32,680
Top left.

1943
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:33,880
Oh, god damn it.

1944
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:34,279
Whatever.

1945
01:19:34,279 --> 01:19:34,600
Fuck.

1946
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:34,920
Okay.

1947
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:36,039
Nobody can.

1948
01:19:36,039 --> 01:19:36,439
K.O.

1949
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:37,859
Get the answer.

1950
01:19:37,859 --> 01:19:38,260
It's this one.

1951
01:19:38,260 --> 01:19:38,739
Go over here.

1952
01:19:38,739 --> 01:19:39,800
Quick.

1953
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:40,600
Hurry up.

1954
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:41,560
Hurry.

1955
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:42,840
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

1956
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:43,319
My voice.

1957
01:19:43,319 --> 01:19:44,359
Oh, no.

1958
01:19:44,359 --> 01:19:44,920
No, no.

1959
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:46,359
I wasn't ready to come back.

1960
01:19:46,359 --> 01:19:48,039
I wasn't ready to come back yet.

1961
01:19:48,039 --> 01:19:48,680
I shouldn't have.

1962
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:49,720
I should have waited another day.

1963
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:51,239
I wasn't ready to come back.

1964
01:19:51,239 --> 01:19:52,279
Wasn't ready to come back.

1965
01:19:52,279 --> 01:19:53,399
I should have waited another day.

1966
01:19:53,399 --> 01:19:54,119
That's my fault.

1967
01:19:54,119 --> 01:19:55,079
I should have waited.

1968
01:19:55,079 --> 01:19:56,250
Okay.

1969
01:19:56,250 --> 01:19:57,529
What if I calm down and just stop?

1970
01:19:57,529 --> 01:20:00,329
I'm gonna just clear my throat for a second.

1971
01:20:00,329 --> 01:20:00,729
We're fine.

1972
01:20:00,729 --> 01:20:06,409
See, I'm back.

1973
01:20:06,409 --> 01:20:09,560
Blue, orange, green, green, yellow.

1974
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:10,199
Seal.

1975
01:20:10,199 --> 01:20:11,899
This one.

1976
01:20:11,899 --> 01:20:12,300
Plus one.

1977
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:12,859
Skip.

1978
01:20:12,859 --> 01:20:14,300
Ran.

1979
01:20:14,300 --> 01:20:15,100
That one.

1980
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:16,699
Shoe polish.

1981
01:20:16,699 --> 01:20:17,739
Arse facey.

1982
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:19,260
Abundance.

1983
01:20:19,260 --> 01:20:20,380
Egg mayonnaise.

1984
01:20:21,260 --> 01:20:26,420
By the way, I'd do this if the stream wasn't even turned on,

1985
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:28,199
I would be doing this.

1986
01:20:28,199 --> 01:20:29,479
You say all the things.

1987
01:20:30,119 --> 01:20:30,920
Out loud.

1988
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:32,069
Okay, baby.

1989
01:20:32,069 --> 01:20:32,229
Yeah.

1990
01:20:32,229 --> 01:20:32,949
Okay, seven.

1991
01:20:32,949 --> 01:20:34,439
This is the elephant part.

1992
01:20:34,439 --> 01:20:39,300
Okay, don't click it.

1993
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:40,260
Wait till it changes.

1994
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:43,449
Like this one.

1995
01:20:43,449 --> 01:20:44,649
Okay.

1996
01:20:44,649 --> 01:20:46,460
Okay, that's a walk.

1997
01:20:46,460 --> 01:20:47,579
In a way.

1998
01:20:47,579 --> 01:20:48,949
Mary Rose.

1999
01:20:48,949 --> 01:20:49,909
Cylindrical.

2000
01:20:49,909 --> 01:20:50,699
Watch that.

2001
01:20:50,699 --> 01:20:52,020
Get a right click.

2002
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:52,340
Okay.

2003
01:20:53,689 --> 01:20:54,569
Afro, 42.

2004
01:20:55,210 --> 01:20:56,020
Tom Cruise.

2005
01:20:57,289 --> 01:20:58,729
Of course, everybody does that.

2006
01:20:58,729 --> 01:20:59,529
Don't lie to me.

2007
01:20:59,529 --> 01:21:00,090
Bottom right.

2008
01:21:00,810 --> 01:21:01,850
So what the hell is it?

2009
01:21:01,850 --> 01:21:07,720
I clicked on all of them.

2010
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:12,380
Which one is it?

2011
01:21:12,380 --> 01:21:13,180
What?

2012
01:21:13,180 --> 01:21:21,689
I clicked on every single one of them.

2013
01:21:22,250 --> 01:21:29,449
It's not anything down here.

2014
01:21:29,449 --> 01:21:29,930
The number?

2015
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:35,850
I can't cheat.

2016
01:21:35,850 --> 01:21:36,329
I can't.

2017
01:21:37,689 --> 01:21:38,810
It's one of the symbols?

2018
01:21:47,510 --> 01:21:47,829
Shit.

2019
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:49,880
I don't know.

2020
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:51,029
I don't know what to do.

2021
01:21:51,029 --> 01:21:51,909
I think I'm just gonna skip it.

2022
01:22:01,859 --> 01:22:02,100
Okay.

2023
01:22:02,659 --> 01:22:07,000
Snake.

2024
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:07,399
Snake.

2025
01:22:08,420 --> 01:22:10,020
Splap me do, right?

2026
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:10,739
Okay.

2027
01:22:10,739 --> 01:22:11,850
Now what is this one?

2028
01:22:11,850 --> 01:22:12,729
Blue, red, blue, yellow.

2029
01:22:12,729 --> 01:22:13,850
It's not what.

2030
01:22:13,850 --> 01:22:19,939
It's probably GTFO.

2031
01:22:19,939 --> 01:22:21,939
Oh, that was so popular at the time.

2032
01:22:21,939 --> 01:22:25,720
Really?

2033
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:26,199
I can't.

2034
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:32,460
This was so deeply in the lingo

2035
01:22:32,460 --> 01:22:33,979
back in early 2000s,

2036
01:22:33,979 --> 01:22:34,859
late 90s internet.

2037
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:37,539
Okay.

2038
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:39,960
I gotta skip it.

2039
01:22:43,909 --> 01:22:47,180
There's the carrot right here.

2040
01:22:47,899 --> 01:22:50,699
Okay.

2041
01:22:50,699 --> 01:22:51,420
It's ugh.

2042
01:22:52,460 --> 01:22:53,819
What the fuck?

2043
01:22:53,819 --> 01:22:54,460
No.

2044
01:22:54,460 --> 01:22:54,779
What?

2045
01:23:01,829 --> 01:23:02,949
Are you serious?

2046
01:23:02,949 --> 01:23:06,579
Some super obscure thing.

2047
01:23:06,579 --> 01:23:07,380
It's impossible.

2048
01:23:07,380 --> 01:23:08,579
That's the nature of the game.

2049
01:23:08,579 --> 01:23:08,899
Okay.

2050
01:23:08,899 --> 01:23:10,180
I gotta get the Wingdings one.

2051
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:20,199
Horse.

2052
01:23:21,510 --> 01:23:22,229
Age.

2053
01:23:22,229 --> 01:23:23,109
17.

2054
01:23:23,109 --> 01:23:23,430
Yeah.

2055
01:23:25,670 --> 01:23:26,310
Oh.

2056
01:23:26,310 --> 01:23:27,430
Resident sleeper.

2057
01:23:27,430 --> 01:23:28,470
Resident sleeper.

2058
01:23:28,470 --> 01:23:29,590
Resident sleeper.

2059
01:23:29,590 --> 01:23:30,710
Resident sleeper.

2060
01:23:30,710 --> 01:23:31,829
Resident sleeper.

2061
01:23:31,829 --> 01:23:33,029
Resident sleeper.

2062
01:23:33,029 --> 01:23:34,229
Resident sleeper.

2063
01:23:34,229 --> 01:23:35,350
Resident sleeper.

2064
01:23:36,489 --> 01:23:37,609
Resident sleeper.

2065
01:23:40,229 --> 01:23:41,670
Why is he not listening to me?

2066
01:23:41,670 --> 01:23:43,270
Resident sleeper, I said.

2067
01:23:51,369 --> 01:23:52,329
What was that laugh?

2068
01:23:53,130 --> 01:23:53,369
No.

2069
01:23:54,090 --> 01:23:54,409
Shit.

2070
01:23:54,409 --> 01:23:55,689
I was looking over at you guys.

2071
01:24:04,569 --> 01:24:08,840
Dude, there's one

2072
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:11,800
three, three, one, seven viewers here

2073
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:12,920
that's like late.

2074
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:16,329
All right.

2075
01:24:16,329 --> 01:24:17,130
There's a lot of people here.

2076
01:24:17,130 --> 01:24:18,970
I'm like, am I trying to like make people leave?

2077
01:24:18,970 --> 01:24:20,649
Am I trying to make people think I'm like a dork?

2078
01:24:21,529 --> 01:24:21,770
No.

2079
01:24:21,770 --> 01:24:22,329
Stay.

2080
01:24:22,329 --> 01:24:22,970
All right.

2081
01:24:22,970 --> 01:24:33,770
All right.

2082
01:24:33,770 --> 01:24:34,970
What the fuck is this one?

2083
01:24:42,119 --> 01:24:44,119
I don't get it.

2084
01:24:44,119 --> 01:24:44,520
Flag.

2085
01:24:45,479 --> 01:24:45,960
Square.

2086
01:24:46,939 --> 01:24:47,420
Diamond.

2087
01:24:52,899 --> 01:24:53,220
Nay.

2088
01:24:54,100 --> 01:24:54,899
Yay.

2089
01:24:54,899 --> 01:24:55,539
Nay, nay.

2090
01:24:56,619 --> 01:24:56,939
No.

2091
01:24:56,939 --> 01:24:57,340
Yes.

2092
01:24:57,340 --> 01:24:57,899
No, no.

2093
01:24:57,899 --> 01:24:58,220
No.

2094
01:24:58,220 --> 01:24:58,619
Yes.

2095
01:24:58,619 --> 01:24:59,420
No, no.

2096
01:24:59,420 --> 01:25:00,460
What is that supposed to mean?

2097
01:25:00,460 --> 01:25:01,500
I can't figure.

2098
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:01,899
No.

2099
01:25:01,899 --> 01:25:02,220
Yes.

2100
01:25:02,220 --> 01:25:02,539
No.

2101
01:25:02,539 --> 01:25:02,779
No.

2102
01:25:03,659 --> 01:25:05,420
What are you trying to convey to me?

2103
01:25:06,149 --> 01:25:07,189
What are you trying to say?

2104
01:25:08,199 --> 01:25:08,680
No.

2105
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:09,079
Yes.

2106
01:25:09,079 --> 01:25:09,399
No.

2107
01:25:09,399 --> 01:25:09,560
No.

2108
01:25:10,439 --> 01:25:10,840
Wait.

2109
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:11,319
No.

2110
01:25:11,319 --> 01:25:11,880
Yes.

2111
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:12,119
No.

2112
01:25:12,119 --> 01:25:12,439
No.

2113
01:25:12,439 --> 01:25:14,779
But I clicked this one already.

2114
01:25:14,779 --> 01:25:15,579
What?

2115
01:25:15,579 --> 01:25:16,729
What?

2116
01:25:16,729 --> 01:25:17,289
I clicked.

2117
01:25:19,369 --> 01:25:20,489
I clicked that one.

2118
01:25:24,869 --> 01:25:25,829
You're in emote only.

2119
01:25:25,829 --> 01:25:27,189
So no backseating.

2120
01:25:27,189 --> 01:25:27,670
I know.

2121
01:25:27,670 --> 01:25:30,149
But I didn't understand.

2122
01:25:30,149 --> 01:25:30,869
I didn't get it.

2123
01:25:33,130 --> 01:25:34,010
I didn't get it.

2124
01:25:34,010 --> 01:25:35,210
And it was so obvious.

2125
01:25:35,850 --> 01:25:36,090
All right.

2126
01:25:36,090 --> 01:25:37,210
Splat we do.

2127
01:25:37,210 --> 01:25:37,689
OK.

2128
01:25:37,689 --> 01:25:38,489
What about this one?

2129
01:25:41,899 --> 01:25:44,859
Blue, red, blue, blue, blue, red, blue, yellow.

2130
01:25:45,899 --> 01:25:49,130
Blue, red, blue, yellow.

2131
01:25:55,210 --> 01:25:56,329
They're cheating again.

2132
01:25:56,329 --> 01:25:57,130
They're cheating again.

2133
01:25:57,130 --> 01:25:57,689
They're cheating.

2134
01:25:58,329 --> 01:26:05,779
They're cheating.

2135
01:26:05,779 --> 01:26:06,659
You can cheat.

2136
01:26:06,659 --> 01:26:07,380
You know what?

2137
01:26:07,380 --> 01:26:11,850
It would be actually easier if emote only mode was off.

2138
01:26:11,850 --> 01:26:15,449
Because then you guys can't do the connect four to tell me what to do.

2139
01:26:15,449 --> 01:26:17,210
It would get lost.

2140
01:26:17,210 --> 01:26:20,149
OK.

2141
01:26:20,149 --> 01:26:20,789
It's not yum.

2142
01:26:20,789 --> 01:26:21,350
It's not.

2143
01:26:22,779 --> 01:26:23,420
What is that?

2144
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:24,539
It's probably what is that?

2145
01:26:24,539 --> 01:26:27,659
Because a lot of Americans don't eat this.

2146
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:30,579
Nope.

2147
01:26:30,579 --> 01:26:31,060
Shit.

2148
01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:32,659
But Pah might not.

2149
01:26:32,659 --> 01:26:33,779
What does that even mean?

2150
01:26:33,779 --> 01:26:38,199
What the fuck does that mean?

2151
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:42,619
Shanghai is indeed the largest city in China.

2152
01:26:42,619 --> 01:26:43,579
Why is there a question mark?

2153
01:26:45,109 --> 01:26:46,630
About 20 centimeters off the ground.

2154
01:26:46,630 --> 01:26:47,029
Never been.

2155
01:26:47,590 --> 01:26:50,939
Why is there a question mark?

2156
01:26:50,939 --> 01:26:51,850
It's true.

2157
01:26:59,609 --> 01:27:00,170
It's never been.

2158
01:27:02,899 --> 01:27:03,779
God damn it.

2159
01:27:10,340 --> 01:27:11,140
Nostalgia.

2160
01:27:12,739 --> 01:27:13,779
Hey, do you guys remember?

2161
01:27:14,939 --> 01:27:16,539
Hey, and who remembers this?

2162
01:27:16,539 --> 01:27:18,119
Nostalgia gaming.

2163
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:21,500
Everyone's probably playing cyberpunk right now.

2164
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:22,699
No, not me.

2165
01:27:22,699 --> 01:27:24,060
I'm a contrarian asshole.

2166
01:27:26,090 --> 01:27:26,810
New game that came out.

2167
01:27:26,810 --> 01:27:27,529
It's like a big AAA game.

2168
01:27:27,529 --> 01:27:28,250
People have been waiting for years.

2169
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:28,810
No, not me.

2170
01:27:28,810 --> 01:27:29,529
Contrarian.

2171
01:27:29,529 --> 01:27:30,489
I don't do that here.

2172
01:27:30,489 --> 01:27:47,189
No, we do things that go under the radar.

2173
01:27:47,189 --> 01:27:51,430
There's tons of streams you can watch to play cyberpunk.

2174
01:27:51,430 --> 01:27:51,989
But not for a minute.

2175
01:27:57,430 --> 01:27:59,829
I yell that to myself in the mirror every stream.

2176
01:28:04,539 --> 01:28:04,939
28.

2177
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:05,979
Abundance.

2178
01:28:06,539 --> 01:28:08,220
Egg mayonnaise.

2179
01:28:08,220 --> 01:28:09,100
Don't screw it up.

2180
01:28:09,739 --> 01:28:11,210
Triple woof.

2181
01:28:11,210 --> 01:28:15,460
What do you guys do?

2182
01:28:15,460 --> 01:28:16,739
There's no answers that I'm looking for.

2183
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:21,539
How was you guys week, by the way?

2184
01:28:21,539 --> 01:28:23,380
How was you guys like Thanksgiving and stuff?

2185
01:28:23,380 --> 01:28:25,819
Wait, I streamed after Thanksgiving, didn't I?

2186
01:28:25,819 --> 01:28:26,939
Yeah, what am I talking about?

2187
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:32,619
I almost fucked that up.

2188
01:28:32,619 --> 01:28:35,750
You guys can't even answer me.

2189
01:28:35,750 --> 01:28:39,319
Wait, which one was it again?

2190
01:28:39,319 --> 01:28:40,439
Top right, right?

2191
01:28:40,439 --> 01:28:40,760
Yes.

2192
01:28:46,869 --> 01:28:47,270
Snake.

2193
01:28:47,829 --> 01:28:48,470
Splat be do.

2194
01:28:49,510 --> 01:28:50,149
Wait, which one?

2195
01:28:50,149 --> 01:28:50,710
Is that okay?

2196
01:28:51,350 --> 01:28:51,909
I forget.

2197
01:28:51,909 --> 01:28:52,869
I forget this one already.

2198
01:28:52,869 --> 01:28:53,829
I think it's okay.

2199
01:28:53,829 --> 01:28:56,659
Do I forget this one already?

2200
01:28:56,659 --> 01:28:59,659
Okay, I got it.

2201
01:28:59,659 --> 01:29:05,880
It kind of looks like Rocco from Rocco's Modern Life.

2202
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:10,260
All right, Papa.

2203
01:29:10,260 --> 01:29:12,470
Why is there a question mark?

2204
01:29:13,430 --> 01:29:13,750
Shit.

2205
01:29:16,170 --> 01:29:18,649
Is indeed the largest city in China.

2206
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:21,960
Oh my god.

2207
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:23,159
So it's the fourth one.

2208
01:29:23,159 --> 01:29:26,619
Oh, about 20 centimeters off the ground.

2209
01:29:26,619 --> 01:29:27,180
Oh my god.

2210
01:29:27,180 --> 01:29:29,020
What is the digestive system?

2211
01:29:29,020 --> 01:29:29,670
A series...

2212
01:29:29,670 --> 01:29:30,390
Oh god.

2213
01:29:30,390 --> 01:29:33,050
A series of workers to break down food and extract energy and nutrients.

2214
01:29:33,050 --> 01:29:33,369
Cheese.

2215
01:29:34,250 --> 01:29:47,289
I thought it was going to be a meme answer or something.

2216
01:29:47,289 --> 01:29:51,159
At least I got to that point now.

2217
01:29:51,159 --> 01:30:00,699
The best part about this is every time I start over, it's just a wave of resident sleepers.

2218
01:30:00,699 --> 01:30:04,460
It's like, isn't that the nature of the game to like have to go through it a bunch of times?

2219
01:30:07,300 --> 01:30:08,180
That's the whole point.

2220
01:30:08,819 --> 01:30:16,020
I'm getting that 100 million off.

2221
01:30:16,020 --> 01:30:16,659
I'm telling you.

2222
01:30:16,659 --> 01:30:17,300
It's going to happen.

2223
01:30:29,939 --> 01:30:32,180
Cyberpunk 2024.

2224
01:30:33,539 --> 01:30:34,180
20...

2225
01:30:34,180 --> 01:30:34,500
40...

2226
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:34,899
What is it?

2227
01:30:36,899 --> 01:30:38,100
2044?

2228
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:38,899
2077?

2229
01:30:39,460 --> 01:30:42,020
No, that's 2024 is the one that I have.

2230
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:43,300
2024, right?

2231
01:30:43,699 --> 01:30:45,819
Who cares?

2232
01:30:45,819 --> 01:30:53,829
Why did they just name it cyberpunk in the future?

2233
01:30:53,829 --> 01:30:55,829
But like, it's just cyberpunk.

2234
01:30:55,829 --> 01:30:57,510
Why does it have to have a year on it?

2235
01:30:57,510 --> 01:31:02,500
Because you know what's going to happen.

2236
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:06,819
In like 2080 in real life, people are going to be laughing at that game.

2237
01:31:06,819 --> 01:31:10,300
They're going to be looking back and going like, yeah, look what they thought was going to happen.

2238
01:31:10,300 --> 01:31:13,270
Don't ever put a year.

2239
01:31:13,270 --> 01:31:18,869
Look at how much we make fun of that.

2240
01:31:18,869 --> 01:31:20,069
Like, danger Will Robinson.

2241
01:31:20,069 --> 01:31:21,029
Danger Will Robinson.

2242
01:31:21,029 --> 01:31:23,189
They thought that was going to happen in like 1992.

2243
01:31:23,829 --> 01:31:29,539
Didn't.

2244
01:31:29,539 --> 01:31:30,420
You get this question wrong.

2245
01:31:30,420 --> 01:31:31,220
No way.

2246
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:32,420
Mary Rose.

2247
01:31:33,159 --> 01:31:33,399
Yes.

2248
01:31:34,119 --> 01:31:34,439
Cheat.

2249
01:31:35,220 --> 01:31:36,020
Thank you.

2250
01:31:36,020 --> 01:31:36,819
Go.

2251
01:31:36,819 --> 01:31:37,619
42.

2252
01:31:37,619 --> 01:31:38,680
Tom Cruise.

2253
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:39,399
Click this.

2254
01:31:39,399 --> 01:31:41,659
Click this one.

2255
01:31:41,659 --> 01:31:42,539
That's Sonic.

2256
01:31:42,539 --> 01:31:46,579
You guys chilling out?

2257
01:31:46,579 --> 01:31:48,340
How you guys doing on a chill...

2258
01:31:48,340 --> 01:31:49,380
I don't even know what day of the week it is.

2259
01:31:49,380 --> 01:31:49,859
I don't even know.

2260
01:31:51,659 --> 01:31:54,619
If you made me tell you what day of the week it is right now,

2261
01:31:54,619 --> 01:31:57,819
for a million dollars, I would not be able to tell you.

2262
01:31:57,819 --> 01:32:03,479
Jeremy, I'm going to give you one fucking million dollars in cash.

2263
01:32:03,479 --> 01:32:04,840
Taxed, by the way.

2264
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:05,800
You don't have to pay taxes.

2265
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:06,680
It's like, taxed.

2266
01:32:06,680 --> 01:32:07,319
One million.

2267
01:32:07,319 --> 01:32:08,119
Cash.

2268
01:32:08,119 --> 01:32:09,640
I can't tell you what day it is.

2269
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:12,649
I don't know.

2270
01:32:12,649 --> 01:32:13,289
It's Wednesday.

2271
01:32:13,289 --> 01:32:13,689
Nope.

2272
01:32:13,689 --> 01:32:14,170
No, what's today?

2273
01:32:14,170 --> 01:32:14,970
Is it Wednesday?

2274
01:32:14,970 --> 01:32:16,229
Did I get the money?

2275
01:32:16,229 --> 01:32:16,789
It's Wednesday.

2276
01:32:16,789 --> 01:32:17,109
I win.

2277
01:32:17,109 --> 01:32:17,829
I'll take it.

2278
01:32:17,829 --> 01:32:20,680
I was going to say Thursday.

2279
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:24,920
Splat me do.

2280
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:25,239
Okay.

2281
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:26,600
Make a...

2282
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:27,239
Make a fight.

2283
01:32:29,750 --> 01:32:30,149
Nice.

2284
01:32:30,149 --> 01:32:30,949
I win.

2285
01:32:30,949 --> 01:32:34,619
Garrett.

2286
01:32:34,619 --> 01:32:34,859
Nay.

2287
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:38,359
Is this one...

2288
01:32:38,359 --> 01:32:39,399
Okay, here we go.

2289
01:32:39,399 --> 01:32:41,640
A series of organs that break down food.

2290
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:44,359
A games console for whole meal biscuits.

2291
01:32:44,359 --> 01:32:45,079
A series of...

2292
01:32:45,079 --> 01:32:45,880
This one.

2293
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:47,380
Something best by...

2294
01:32:47,380 --> 01:32:48,100
This one!

2295
01:32:48,100 --> 01:32:49,319
Okay, it's top right.

2296
01:32:49,319 --> 01:32:50,970
It was top right.

2297
01:32:50,970 --> 01:32:53,590
I do remember.

2298
01:32:53,590 --> 01:32:54,149
It was...

2299
01:32:54,149 --> 01:32:54,470
Wait.

2300
01:32:54,470 --> 01:32:57,029
Remember the color or remember where the placement was?

2301
01:32:57,270 --> 01:32:57,909
It was red.

2302
01:32:59,300 --> 01:32:59,699
Shit!

2303
01:32:59,699 --> 01:33:00,659
It was placement.

2304
01:33:00,659 --> 01:33:08,359
That was a wave of resident sleepers.

2305
01:33:15,670 --> 01:33:16,630
So predictable.

2306
01:33:17,270 --> 01:33:18,390
At least do it...

2307
01:33:18,390 --> 01:33:21,109
Okay, at least do it by question 30.

2308
01:33:21,109 --> 01:33:28,630
You can't just do it at question 1 through 10 and then stop.

2309
01:33:28,630 --> 01:33:29,989
You can't just do that.

2310
01:33:29,989 --> 01:33:31,909
You have to do it like the whole time.

2311
01:33:32,470 --> 01:33:34,470
But don't do it the whole time because that...

2312
01:33:34,470 --> 01:33:34,949
What the hell?

2313
01:33:35,750 --> 01:33:37,029
Don't do that the whole time.

2314
01:33:46,039 --> 01:33:48,840
Okay, blue, orange, green, green, yellow.

2315
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:51,479
You better be getting the next game ready because I'm going to beat this soon.

2316
01:33:51,479 --> 01:34:01,880
I have this weird memory that's coming back to me right now.

2317
01:34:04,819 --> 01:34:08,149
It was four, five o'clock in the morning.

2318
01:34:08,149 --> 01:34:14,010
I was in college and I was incredibly tired and just over exhausted.

2319
01:34:14,010 --> 01:34:20,789
And I was playing this and my body and brain wanted so badly to go to sleep.

2320
01:34:20,789 --> 01:34:21,430
But I wouldn't.

2321
01:34:21,430 --> 01:34:24,149
I had like class the next day.

2322
01:34:24,149 --> 01:34:27,739
I just was sitting there just with my eyes just burning.

2323
01:34:28,779 --> 01:34:30,140
I was on the question 50.

2324
01:34:30,140 --> 01:34:31,020
I'll go to the beginning.

2325
01:34:31,020 --> 01:34:32,140
Go through, go through, go through.

2326
01:34:32,140 --> 01:34:34,760
Question 55, go to the beginning.

2327
01:34:34,760 --> 01:34:36,520
And I think I had closed my laptop.

2328
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:38,939
I was like, I have to go to fucking bed now.

2329
01:34:39,500 --> 01:34:40,779
I can't do this anymore.

2330
01:34:40,779 --> 01:34:48,739
Do you know when you're lying down in bed and you know that you should be sleeping

2331
01:34:48,739 --> 01:34:50,970
but you just don't?

2332
01:34:50,970 --> 01:34:57,289
Because your mind just needs to just continue to do something.

2333
01:34:57,289 --> 01:35:00,090
Sleeping is too boring for your brain at that moment.

2334
01:35:00,090 --> 01:35:04,090
Even though your brain and body are like, dude, just fucking put your iPad down.

2335
01:35:04,090 --> 01:35:04,890
Put your phone down.

2336
01:35:04,890 --> 01:35:05,529
Just close your eyes.

2337
01:35:05,529 --> 01:35:07,130
You'll be asleep in 30 seconds.

2338
01:35:07,130 --> 01:35:09,739
It's like, no, I don't want to do that.

2339
01:35:09,739 --> 01:35:12,140
I like want to keep playing the impossible quiz.

2340
01:35:12,140 --> 01:35:14,220
I want to keep watching this woodcutting video.

2341
01:35:14,220 --> 01:35:27,300
So judging by all the residents sleepers, it feels like a lot of you guys are doing

2342
01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:28,020
that right now.

2343
01:35:28,020 --> 01:35:39,640
It's fun.

2344
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:40,760
Okay, here we go.

2345
01:35:40,760 --> 01:35:41,560
This is where it gets a little...

2346
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:43,460
Okay, I got to remember this.

2347
01:35:43,460 --> 01:35:44,500
Is it placement?

2348
01:35:45,140 --> 01:35:46,020
It's placement.

2349
01:35:46,020 --> 01:35:47,539
So it's right there.

2350
01:35:47,539 --> 01:35:49,300
Right here, right kind of in the top kind of center.

2351
01:35:54,659 --> 01:35:55,779
I thought it was color.

2352
01:35:55,779 --> 01:36:03,180
Oh, by the way, anybody know how long are the game awards?

2353
01:36:03,180 --> 01:36:06,170
How many hours?

2354
01:36:06,810 --> 01:36:10,739
Like just write yay and write how many hours it is.

2355
01:36:10,739 --> 01:36:14,489
Judging by the amount of residents sleepers, whatever.

2356
01:36:14,489 --> 01:36:18,390
Okay, four residents sleepers in four hours?

2357
01:36:18,390 --> 01:36:19,270
Three hours?

2358
01:36:19,270 --> 01:36:20,789
Is it three hours?

2359
01:36:21,350 --> 01:36:26,569
Okay, four residents sleepers in four hours.

2360
01:36:26,569 --> 01:36:27,050
Three, okay.

2361
01:36:27,609 --> 01:36:30,390
All right, here we go.

2362
01:36:30,390 --> 01:36:31,189
I hope I remembered.

2363
01:36:31,189 --> 01:36:34,949
It's right here.

2364
01:36:34,949 --> 01:36:35,350
Right there.

2365
01:36:36,699 --> 01:36:37,659
What?

2366
01:36:37,659 --> 01:36:38,380
What?

2367
01:36:38,380 --> 01:36:39,500
That doesn't make any sense.

2368
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:39,739
What?

2369
01:36:43,529 --> 01:36:44,250
What are you talking about?

2370
01:36:44,810 --> 01:36:46,140
Is it hidden somewhere?

2371
01:36:46,779 --> 01:36:49,739
What?

2372
01:36:49,739 --> 01:36:53,210
It was the red one, but it was up here.

2373
01:36:53,210 --> 01:36:54,810
I clicked red last time and it was wrong.

2374
01:36:55,449 --> 01:36:59,510
What just happened?

2375
01:37:01,159 --> 01:37:01,479
What?

2376
01:37:01,479 --> 01:37:11,829
What the fuck was that?

2377
01:37:16,310 --> 01:37:16,630
What?

2378
01:37:17,350 --> 01:37:18,069
No.

2379
01:37:18,069 --> 01:37:18,390
What?

2380
01:37:19,850 --> 01:37:22,359
What?

2381
01:37:22,359 --> 01:37:23,079
What?

2382
01:37:23,079 --> 01:37:27,189
I don't understand.

2383
01:37:27,189 --> 01:37:28,390
It was correct for a second.

2384
01:37:34,489 --> 01:37:35,289
All right, turn off.

2385
01:37:35,930 --> 01:37:37,050
Turn off emote only mode.

2386
01:37:37,050 --> 01:37:38,569
I want some suggestions on there.

2387
01:37:38,569 --> 01:37:40,250
I'm going to do the same thing I did when I was in college.

2388
01:37:40,810 --> 01:37:41,930
I'm going to get to question 16.

2389
01:37:41,930 --> 01:37:43,529
Just close the laptop and be like, fuck this.

2390
01:37:53,289 --> 01:37:54,890
Blue, red, blue.

2391
01:37:54,890 --> 01:37:58,300
Oh, okay.

2392
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:01,560
I get you now.

2393
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:02,920
I see what you're saying.

2394
01:38:02,920 --> 01:38:03,239
Okay.

2395
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:05,750
This is the worst game ever.

2396
01:38:05,750 --> 01:38:07,510
It's a classic.

2397
01:38:07,670 --> 01:38:09,829
It's like saying that like Super Mario is the worst game ever.

2398
01:38:20,739 --> 01:38:21,380
Stop.

2399
01:38:21,380 --> 01:38:22,100
You made your point.

2400
01:38:22,739 --> 01:38:24,729
Wait, what do you guys think?

2401
01:38:25,369 --> 01:38:26,569
You think I'm making a point?

2402
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:28,199
What do you mean?

2403
01:38:28,199 --> 01:38:29,319
I'm trying to get through this.

2404
01:38:29,319 --> 01:38:31,159
I have a hundred million on the line.

2405
01:38:31,159 --> 01:38:32,359
The deal is off the table.

2406
01:38:32,359 --> 01:38:32,600
What?

2407
01:38:33,159 --> 01:38:36,420
What are you talking about?

2408
01:38:36,420 --> 01:38:37,140
There's no deal.

2409
01:38:37,140 --> 01:38:38,500
The deal is off the table.

2410
01:38:38,500 --> 01:38:43,079
How is it off the table?

2411
01:38:43,079 --> 01:38:43,880
I cheated?

2412
01:38:44,439 --> 01:38:45,000
When did I?

2413
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,119
What are you talking about?

2414
01:38:46,119 --> 01:38:47,939
When did I cheat?

2415
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:51,100
Off the table.

2416
01:38:51,100 --> 01:38:51,659
No deal.

2417
01:38:51,659 --> 01:38:53,260
You had one shot.

2418
01:38:53,260 --> 01:38:58,060
So wait, it's been an emote only mode this whole time

2419
01:38:58,060 --> 01:38:59,500
and you guys have desperately been telling me

2420
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:00,539
that I don't have to keep doing this

2421
01:39:00,539 --> 01:39:08,100
because I lost the bet already?

2422
01:39:08,100 --> 01:39:08,739
Oh.

2423
01:39:08,739 --> 01:39:12,649
Well, now I kind of want to just do it.

2424
01:39:13,289 --> 01:39:20,420
Keep going.

2425
01:39:20,979 --> 01:39:22,630
I know I'm close to the end.

2426
01:39:23,430 --> 01:39:25,029
There's like 80 questions or something, right?

2427
01:39:25,670 --> 01:39:28,970
We have to pay him to stop.

2428
01:39:28,970 --> 01:39:30,489
No, you don't have to pay me to stop.

2429
01:39:31,420 --> 01:39:34,300
Don't pay me to stop.

2430
01:39:34,300 --> 01:39:34,619
Okay.

2431
01:39:34,619 --> 01:39:36,140
Blue, red, blue, yellow.

2432
01:39:51,159 --> 01:39:51,399
Okay.

2433
01:39:51,399 --> 01:39:51,960
I did.

2434
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:53,399
Blue, red, blue, yellow.

2435
01:39:54,840 --> 01:39:55,560
Hey, lobster.

2436
01:39:55,560 --> 01:39:57,319
Thanks for the five community subs.

2437
01:39:57,319 --> 01:40:00,600
Blue, red, blue, yellow.

2438
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:01,659
Look out.

2439
01:40:01,659 --> 01:40:04,149
Count Dracula.

2440
01:40:04,149 --> 01:40:05,189
He's a sexy one.

2441
01:40:05,189 --> 01:40:05,430
Sorry.

2442
01:40:05,430 --> 01:40:06,470
I prefer lemurs.

2443
01:40:06,470 --> 01:40:06,869
I don't know.

2444
01:40:08,329 --> 01:40:08,970
Look.

2445
01:40:08,970 --> 01:40:10,090
Count Dracula.

2446
01:40:10,090 --> 01:40:10,409
One.

2447
01:40:10,970 --> 01:40:11,689
Okay.

2448
01:40:11,689 --> 01:40:14,569
On the subject of Dracula, what is his favorite food?

2449
01:40:14,569 --> 01:40:15,210
Shepherd's pie.

2450
01:40:16,229 --> 01:40:17,430
Charge the laser.

2451
01:40:17,430 --> 01:40:19,460
How?

2452
01:40:19,460 --> 01:40:24,550
Oh, how do I do that?

2453
01:40:24,550 --> 01:40:25,350
Shoot it.

2454
01:40:25,350 --> 01:40:29,460
Be honest.

2455
01:40:29,460 --> 01:40:32,100
Did you manage to do the last question on your first go?

2456
01:40:32,100 --> 01:40:33,140
Yes, I did.

2457
01:40:33,140 --> 01:40:40,170
Is that a butt?

2458
01:40:50,180 --> 01:40:54,420
If thimple, click the moth.

2459
01:40:56,859 --> 01:40:58,619
If thimple, click the moth.

2460
01:40:59,899 --> 01:41:00,220
What?

2461
01:41:00,779 --> 01:41:02,300
Oh, the moss, not the mop.

2462
01:41:02,859 --> 01:41:03,579
The moth.

2463
01:41:03,579 --> 01:41:03,819
Okay.

2464
01:41:04,779 --> 01:41:06,220
What are chicken nuggets made of?

2465
01:41:07,109 --> 01:41:08,630
Tasteless white filth.

2466
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:15,239
Win.

2467
01:41:16,220 --> 01:41:17,579
It's definitely, it's not.

2468
01:41:17,579 --> 01:41:17,899
Soil?

2469
01:41:21,420 --> 01:41:21,899
I don't know.

2470
01:41:21,899 --> 01:41:23,180
So I'll come back to it.

2471
01:41:23,180 --> 01:41:23,420
Skip.

2472
01:41:24,220 --> 01:41:25,100
Which is true.

2473
01:41:25,100 --> 01:41:26,779
PSP is better than the DS.

2474
01:41:27,340 --> 01:41:29,100
The DS is better than the PSP.

2475
01:41:29,750 --> 01:41:31,750
PSP is the DS.

2476
01:41:31,750 --> 01:41:38,420
Or egg is better than 28.

2477
01:41:38,420 --> 01:41:39,140
Egg.

2478
01:41:39,140 --> 01:41:40,260
Click the largest.

2479
01:41:44,359 --> 01:41:45,399
It's gonna be a trick.

2480
01:41:45,399 --> 01:41:48,149
This is a trick.

2481
01:41:48,149 --> 01:41:49,989
It's probably, I don't know.

2482
01:41:49,989 --> 01:41:50,869
Click the largest.

2483
01:41:51,670 --> 01:41:53,420
Got it.

2484
01:41:53,420 --> 01:41:53,739
Hurry up.

2485
01:41:53,739 --> 01:41:54,539
It's the end of the world.

2486
01:41:55,180 --> 01:41:55,739
Armageddon.

2487
01:41:55,739 --> 01:41:57,180
Oh my fucking god.

2488
01:41:57,180 --> 01:41:57,659
D.

2489
01:41:57,659 --> 01:41:58,300
Armageddon.

2490
01:41:58,300 --> 01:41:58,460
D.

2491
01:42:23,100 --> 01:42:24,140
No, what else?

2492
01:42:24,140 --> 01:42:25,340
What do you want me to do?

2493
01:42:25,340 --> 01:42:26,619
I'm not playing cyberpunk.

2494
01:42:28,890 --> 01:42:29,770
What's that?

2495
01:42:29,770 --> 01:42:30,569
Fucking stop it.

2496
01:42:30,569 --> 01:42:30,810
All right.

2497
01:42:30,810 --> 01:42:31,609
What's the next game then?

2498
01:42:37,699 --> 01:42:39,140
What's the next flash game?

2499
01:42:39,779 --> 01:42:41,100
Well, you guys figure it out.

2500
01:42:41,100 --> 01:42:48,840
You guys will debate it in chat for like a few minutes.

2501
01:42:48,840 --> 01:42:49,399
Cool math.

2502
01:42:49,399 --> 01:42:54,250
I've done cool math.

2503
01:42:54,250 --> 01:42:54,970
Pop-up games.

2504
01:42:54,970 --> 01:42:55,850
Age of War.

2505
01:42:57,850 --> 01:42:59,289
Age of War?

2506
01:42:59,289 --> 01:43:02,220
I feel like that's gonna take a while.

2507
01:43:02,220 --> 01:43:03,579
I feel like it's like a strategy game or something.

2508
01:43:04,600 --> 01:43:05,239
Yes, do that.

2509
01:43:05,239 --> 01:43:06,520
Is that like an idle game?

2510
01:43:06,520 --> 01:43:08,279
You guys are gonna be mad at me for that one.

2511
01:43:08,279 --> 01:43:12,819
Do Age of War.

2512
01:43:12,819 --> 01:43:17,350
I will after this.

2513
01:43:17,350 --> 01:43:17,510
All right.

2514
01:43:17,510 --> 01:43:18,630
I'm gonna see if I can get through here.

2515
01:43:18,630 --> 01:43:29,930
Cookie clicker.

2516
01:43:29,930 --> 01:43:32,010
I did an idle game already.

2517
01:43:34,539 --> 01:43:35,899
Swords and sandals.

2518
01:43:35,899 --> 01:43:36,779
I'm seeing a lot of that.

2519
01:43:36,779 --> 01:43:37,180
Is that good?

2520
01:43:37,899 --> 01:43:48,039
I, no, I legit refuse to play Happy Wheels.

2521
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:49,800
I refuse.

2522
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:58,149
I'm never gonna play that game ever for any reason.

2523
01:43:58,710 --> 01:44:04,859
Both swords and sandals.

2524
01:44:04,859 --> 01:44:05,340
Is it good?

2525
01:44:09,829 --> 01:44:10,470
Any reason?

2526
01:44:11,029 --> 01:44:13,529
I wouldn't even do it for a million dollars.

2527
01:44:22,630 --> 01:44:24,359
Play Roblox.

2528
01:44:24,359 --> 01:44:27,899
Hey, I'll play Roblox when their IPO comes out.

2529
01:44:27,899 --> 01:44:28,779
We can celebrate it.

2530
01:44:29,500 --> 01:44:31,220
They went public.

2531
01:44:31,779 --> 01:44:32,420
Yeah.

2532
01:44:32,420 --> 01:44:34,100
Is it gonna be like, uh.

2533
01:44:34,100 --> 01:44:36,409
Swords and sandals.

2534
01:44:36,409 --> 01:44:36,890
I'll check it out.

2535
01:44:43,770 --> 01:44:44,489
I did remember.

2536
01:44:44,489 --> 01:44:45,850
Blue, red, blue, yellow.

2537
01:44:51,060 --> 01:44:51,539
Okay.

2538
01:44:51,539 --> 01:44:51,859
One.

2539
01:44:52,420 --> 01:44:54,140
His favorite food is shepherd's pie.

2540
01:44:55,880 --> 01:45:01,079
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot it, shoot it, shoot it.

2541
01:45:01,079 --> 01:45:02,520
Play Raid Shadow Legends.

2542
01:45:02,520 --> 01:45:02,920
No.

2543
01:45:02,920 --> 01:45:04,119
That doesn't, that will never happen.

2544
01:45:05,449 --> 01:45:06,890
I did it on my first try.

2545
01:45:06,890 --> 01:45:07,369
Thumbs up.

2546
01:45:08,229 --> 01:45:10,229
Click the moth.

2547
01:45:10,229 --> 01:45:15,420
Now this, I'm stuck here.

2548
01:45:15,420 --> 01:45:21,979
Play Spongebob flip flop.

2549
01:45:21,979 --> 01:45:22,699
I'll try, um.

2550
01:45:24,810 --> 01:45:27,029
I just clicked on like the first five.

2551
01:45:27,029 --> 01:45:28,390
It was five people said win in a row.

2552
01:45:28,390 --> 01:45:29,350
And I, or I did, no.

2553
01:45:29,909 --> 01:45:32,010
Faceless white filth.

2554
01:45:32,010 --> 01:45:32,250
Okay.

2555
01:45:32,970 --> 01:45:34,170
I already knew the answer to that.

2556
01:45:34,170 --> 01:45:34,409
Egg.

2557
01:45:35,050 --> 01:45:35,850
Like the largest.

2558
01:45:36,729 --> 01:45:37,050
Okay.

2559
01:45:37,050 --> 01:45:38,090
Armageddon.

2560
01:45:38,090 --> 01:45:39,210
Hurry up, it's the end of the world.

2561
01:45:39,210 --> 01:45:39,689
Armageddon.

2562
01:45:40,329 --> 01:45:41,529
Oh my fucking, Australia.

2563
01:45:42,250 --> 01:45:42,489
What?

2564
01:45:44,119 --> 01:45:45,239
Oh my god, damn it.

2565
01:45:45,880 --> 01:45:46,920
We'll figure it out the next game.

2566
01:45:46,920 --> 01:45:48,439
We'll just figure, we'll get the next game figured out.

2567
01:45:48,439 --> 01:45:51,380
We're gonna play swords and sandals, possibly.

2568
01:45:51,380 --> 01:45:54,979
Any other things that you guys have up your sleeve.

2569
01:45:54,979 --> 01:46:00,579
Swords and sandals, um.

2570
01:46:00,579 --> 01:46:02,739
Balloons, tower defense is a pretty good idea.

2571
01:46:02,739 --> 01:46:09,430
Swords and sandals is long enough.

2572
01:46:09,430 --> 01:46:10,470
Okay, all right.

2573
01:46:10,470 --> 01:46:11,750
Madness interactive.

2574
01:46:11,750 --> 01:46:12,550
That's an interesting game.

2575
01:46:12,550 --> 01:46:15,029
But please, why don't you guys explain, tell me about it.

2576
01:46:15,029 --> 01:46:18,859
What is the premise of madness interactive?

2577
01:46:18,859 --> 01:46:19,659
What do you do?

2578
01:46:20,220 --> 01:46:22,180
Tell me, I'd like to read about it.

2579
01:46:22,180 --> 01:46:23,979
For the next five to ten minutes.

2580
01:46:24,899 --> 01:46:25,779
Balloons six.

2581
01:46:27,060 --> 01:46:27,859
It sucks.

2582
01:46:27,859 --> 01:46:30,020
Okay, well, that's why we're having this debate.

2583
01:46:30,020 --> 01:46:31,619
That's why we're spending the time here.

2584
01:46:31,619 --> 01:46:33,619
To make sure we get everybody's opinions on the matter.

2585
01:46:37,720 --> 01:46:38,279
Tropica.

2586
01:46:39,720 --> 01:46:40,680
That's interesting too.

2587
01:46:41,399 --> 01:46:42,279
Let's check that out.

2588
01:46:44,119 --> 01:46:45,479
Interactive buddy.

2589
01:46:45,479 --> 01:46:49,659
Wait, is that the moment you just kind of throw the guy around a room?

2590
01:46:49,659 --> 01:46:57,079
And you like punch him in the face and stuff and like throw stuff at him?

2591
01:46:57,079 --> 01:46:59,899
All right, this is the last attempt, I swear to God, no matter what.

2592
01:46:59,899 --> 01:47:06,859
And I'm gonna open up sword and sandals.

2593
01:47:06,859 --> 01:47:09,020
No matter what, this is the final attempt.

2594
01:47:09,020 --> 01:47:12,439
People are, I'm looking at the capas.

2595
01:47:12,439 --> 01:47:14,199
Okay, let's make this interesting.

2596
01:47:14,199 --> 01:47:17,239
If I do another attempt, add a billion to the debt.

2597
01:47:17,239 --> 01:47:18,279
How's that sound?

2598
01:47:18,279 --> 01:47:19,960
Right, I got it, now I have to.

2599
01:47:19,960 --> 01:47:31,640
It's the last attempt.

2600
01:47:31,640 --> 01:47:33,770
Cruise, okay, okay.

2601
01:47:34,489 --> 01:47:38,729
This one, a final ninja.

2602
01:47:40,260 --> 01:47:41,140
Okay, put it on the list.

2603
01:47:47,539 --> 01:47:50,420
Play the world's hardest game.

2604
01:47:50,420 --> 01:47:51,779
No, I don't, let's play something fun.

2605
01:47:53,050 --> 01:47:54,890
Not that that game's not fun, but you know.

2606
01:47:55,449 --> 01:47:59,659
Age of War.

2607
01:47:59,659 --> 01:48:04,380
I got that, it's on the list.

2608
01:48:04,380 --> 01:48:05,340
Blue, red, blue, yellow.

2609
01:48:08,949 --> 01:48:11,270
Blue, red, blue, yellow.

2610
01:48:11,909 --> 01:48:13,029
Okay, one.

2611
01:48:13,029 --> 01:48:13,670
Shepherd's Pie.

2612
01:48:14,390 --> 01:48:14,710
Shoot.

2613
01:48:15,270 --> 01:48:26,229
Okay, I got it on my first go.

2614
01:48:26,229 --> 01:48:26,710
Thumbs up.

2615
01:48:27,430 --> 01:48:27,829
Moss.

2616
01:48:28,710 --> 01:48:30,069
Tasteless white filth.

2617
01:48:30,069 --> 01:48:30,789
Egg.

2618
01:48:30,789 --> 01:48:31,909
Click the largest.

2619
01:48:31,909 --> 01:48:34,149
Okay, now the next one is the Armageddon one.

2620
01:48:34,149 --> 01:48:37,270
It's the end of the world.

2621
01:48:37,270 --> 01:48:40,069
Oh, shit, here we go.

2622
01:48:40,069 --> 01:48:40,630
Can I show this?

2623
01:48:41,430 --> 01:48:42,630
What do I do, what do I do, what do I do?

2624
01:48:44,680 --> 01:48:45,800
What do I do, what do I do?

2625
01:48:45,800 --> 01:48:47,079
Okay, it's a big hairy asshole.

2626
01:48:47,079 --> 01:48:47,560
Whatever it was.

2627
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:56,060
Oh, you have to pet the cat.

2628
01:49:09,029 --> 01:49:12,260
Okay, are you enjoying the quiz?

2629
01:49:12,260 --> 01:49:13,779
I'm level 69.

2630
01:49:14,500 --> 01:49:16,020
My dog's got no nose.

2631
01:49:16,020 --> 01:49:16,899
How does it smell?

2632
01:49:17,960 --> 01:49:18,840
How am I supposed to know?

2633
01:49:19,479 --> 01:49:20,680
Terrible, like piss.

2634
01:49:24,550 --> 01:49:25,510
Terrible, fuck.

2635
01:49:27,270 --> 01:49:28,470
How am I supposed to know?

2636
01:49:31,380 --> 01:49:33,300
Using my dog's got no nose.

2637
01:49:33,300 --> 01:49:34,100
How does it smell?

2638
01:49:34,739 --> 01:49:40,500
How am I supposed to know?

2639
01:49:40,500 --> 01:49:41,300
Using its anus?

2640
01:49:42,020 --> 01:49:42,899
Oh, Christ.

2641
01:49:46,060 --> 01:49:46,460
Search.

2642
01:49:47,100 --> 01:49:55,899
What am I searching for?

2643
01:50:25,420 --> 01:50:25,979
I got it.

2644
01:50:26,619 --> 01:50:27,420
Question mark.

2645
01:50:31,479 --> 01:50:33,000
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.

2646
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:33,399
I don't understand.

2647
01:50:33,399 --> 01:50:34,920
What is it trying to ask me?

2648
01:50:38,439 --> 01:50:39,239
It's just the same one.

2649
01:50:39,239 --> 01:50:41,159
How many questions does this quiz have?

2650
01:50:41,880 --> 01:50:42,970
100.

2651
01:50:43,770 --> 01:50:44,489
No one knows that.

2652
01:50:44,489 --> 01:50:46,250
You can't really class this as a quiz.

2653
01:50:49,109 --> 01:50:49,989
200.

2654
01:50:50,069 --> 01:50:51,270
It's not 200.

2655
01:50:51,270 --> 01:50:51,829
It's 100.

2656
01:50:54,760 --> 01:50:58,020
Skip it.

2657
01:50:58,020 --> 01:50:58,819
I don't know.

2658
01:50:58,819 --> 01:51:00,520
Skip it.

2659
01:51:00,520 --> 01:51:01,560
Be prepared.

2660
01:51:01,560 --> 01:51:05,220
Skip it, skip it.

2661
01:51:06,199 --> 01:51:07,960
You are my candy girl.

2662
01:51:08,840 --> 01:51:09,319
Sugar.

2663
01:51:11,720 --> 01:51:13,319
Oh, honey, honey.

2664
01:51:15,880 --> 01:51:18,439
You are my sugar.

2665
01:51:18,439 --> 01:51:19,319
Honey, honey.

2666
01:51:20,039 --> 01:51:20,680
Okay.

2667
01:51:20,680 --> 01:51:21,880
What is this?

2668
01:51:21,880 --> 01:51:23,479
It's a tea bag.

2669
01:51:23,479 --> 01:51:24,520
A testicle.

2670
01:51:24,520 --> 01:51:26,439
Mr. T's oven glove.

2671
01:51:26,439 --> 01:51:27,960
Question 77.

2672
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:33,239
It's a tea bag.

2673
01:51:33,720 --> 01:51:34,920
But I don't know if it is.

2674
01:51:34,920 --> 01:51:35,399
I don't know.

2675
01:51:35,399 --> 01:51:36,119
It could be wrong.

2676
01:51:38,170 --> 01:51:38,670
Skip.

2677
01:51:39,210 --> 01:51:39,930
Déjà vu.

2678
01:51:40,569 --> 01:51:41,609
Plus one life.

2679
01:51:42,170 --> 01:51:43,100
Give it to me.

2680
01:51:44,380 --> 01:51:44,880
No!

2681
01:51:49,130 --> 01:51:51,369
No, I'm so close to the end of the game.

2682
01:51:57,510 --> 01:51:58,869
I'm so close.

2683
01:51:58,869 --> 01:52:00,710
There's like three questions left.

2684
01:52:02,550 --> 01:52:03,510
No, I have...

2685
01:52:03,510 --> 01:52:04,789
It's a billion dollars.

2686
01:52:04,789 --> 01:52:05,590
What's it at now?

2687
01:52:06,819 --> 01:52:07,460
No, I don't.

2688
01:52:07,460 --> 01:52:07,859
I can't.

2689
01:52:07,859 --> 01:52:08,739
That's a billion.

2690
01:52:09,460 --> 01:52:11,590
That's too much to add.

2691
01:52:12,149 --> 01:52:14,470
That's too...

2692
01:52:14,470 --> 01:52:14,949
No, I can't.

2693
01:52:14,949 --> 01:52:15,430
It's too much to add.

2694
01:52:15,430 --> 01:52:15,989
What's the next one?

2695
01:52:15,989 --> 01:52:16,710
Sword and sandals.

2696
01:52:18,090 --> 01:52:18,729
Sword and sandals.

2697
01:52:18,729 --> 01:52:19,529
Let's go.

2698
01:52:19,529 --> 01:52:21,560
God damn it.

2699
01:52:21,560 --> 01:52:22,439
I really want to beat it too.

2700
01:52:24,869 --> 01:52:26,069
Swords and sandals.

2701
01:52:26,069 --> 01:52:27,670
Wait, this is on Steam.

2702
01:52:27,670 --> 01:52:34,729
To buy this on Steam?

2703
01:52:35,449 --> 01:52:41,989
Hey Wiggly Joe, thanks for the 15 community subs.

2704
01:52:42,890 --> 01:52:44,409
15 subs.

2705
01:52:44,409 --> 01:52:45,289
You can if you want.

2706
01:52:45,289 --> 01:52:45,930
Where do I get it?

2707
01:52:46,970 --> 01:52:47,689
What can I just play it?

2708
01:52:47,689 --> 01:52:48,649
Is it on congregate?

2709
01:52:52,310 --> 01:52:55,319
Sword and sandals?

2710
01:52:57,899 --> 01:53:02,970
What the hell is it?

2711
01:53:05,590 --> 01:53:07,109
Swords and souls.

2712
01:53:07,109 --> 01:53:08,710
Swords and sandals?

2713
01:53:09,670 --> 01:53:12,390
Swords and sandals crusader.

2714
01:53:12,390 --> 01:53:13,750
Swords and sandals one.

2715
01:53:13,750 --> 01:53:15,109
Swords and sandals two.

2716
01:53:15,989 --> 01:53:17,829
I guess I'm just going to do the first one.

2717
01:53:17,829 --> 01:53:26,229
Loading game info.

2718
01:53:26,869 --> 01:53:27,670
Okay.

2719
01:53:27,670 --> 01:53:32,760
Oh, that scared the shit out of me.

2720
01:53:45,529 --> 01:53:49,619
Swords and sandals.

2721
01:53:50,579 --> 01:53:52,630
Is this game any good?

2722
01:53:52,630 --> 01:53:53,590
Swords and sandals two.

2723
01:53:53,590 --> 01:53:54,149
Waiting room.

2724
01:53:54,149 --> 01:53:55,029
But hold on.

2725
01:53:55,670 --> 01:53:57,850
I just...

2726
01:53:57,850 --> 01:53:58,329
I have...

2727
01:53:58,329 --> 01:53:59,369
This is the first game.

2728
01:53:59,369 --> 01:54:00,810
Can I even play the first one?

2729
01:54:01,529 --> 01:54:10,489
Okay.

2730
01:54:10,489 --> 01:54:11,770
Play.

2731
01:54:11,770 --> 01:54:12,329
How to play.

2732
01:54:12,329 --> 01:54:13,449
Click here to get an overview.

2733
01:54:14,250 --> 01:54:15,449
Swords and sandals is a...

2734
01:54:15,449 --> 01:54:16,329
Oops.

2735
01:54:16,329 --> 01:54:18,489
Is a mini epic gladiator game.

2736
01:54:19,210 --> 01:54:19,529
Wait.

2737
01:54:19,529 --> 01:54:21,289
Two is just the same thing but better.

2738
01:54:21,850 --> 01:54:26,060
It's just the exact same thing.

2739
01:54:27,430 --> 01:54:27,909
Yes.

2740
01:54:27,909 --> 01:54:28,710
Two is way better.

2741
01:54:28,710 --> 01:54:29,270
Just play it.

2742
01:54:29,270 --> 01:54:30,630
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

2743
01:54:30,630 --> 01:54:31,989
I've seen a couple of no's but...

2744
01:54:32,710 --> 01:54:32,949
I've...

2745
01:54:33,590 --> 01:54:39,800
Sword and sandals two.

2746
01:54:39,800 --> 01:54:41,000
Emperors reign.

2747
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,100
Why the different versions of this?

2748
01:54:43,100 --> 01:54:44,380
Swords and sandals two.

2749
01:54:44,939 --> 01:54:46,140
Why the different versions?

2750
01:54:46,699 --> 01:54:52,260
The game will start after this message.

2751
01:54:52,260 --> 01:54:52,739
What message?

2752
01:54:53,460 --> 01:54:58,229
Game brought to you by Third Sense.

2753
01:54:58,869 --> 01:54:59,189
This is the...

2754
01:55:00,149 --> 01:55:07,909
Okay, I have to zoom this in.

2755
01:55:08,710 --> 01:55:11,750
Graphics on high, obviously.

2756
01:55:12,630 --> 01:55:14,579
This is way too far.

2757
01:55:14,579 --> 01:55:15,539
I need to go in closer.

2758
01:55:15,539 --> 01:55:15,939
Hold on.

2759
01:55:16,739 --> 01:55:20,180
Okay.

2760
01:55:20,180 --> 01:55:20,659
There's a...

2761
01:55:20,659 --> 01:55:21,460
Why is there a chat?

2762
01:55:22,100 --> 01:55:31,979
I remember not being able to put games on high.

2763
01:55:32,939 --> 01:55:34,710
Every game had to be...

2764
01:55:34,710 --> 01:55:35,029
You had to...

2765
01:55:35,029 --> 01:55:37,189
I had to right click every game and put it all...

2766
01:55:37,189 --> 01:55:39,510
Put like the shockwave player down to low.

2767
01:55:39,510 --> 01:55:41,659
Because it would run at like two frames a second.

2768
01:55:42,220 --> 01:55:45,340
Okay.

2769
01:55:45,340 --> 01:55:45,899
That looks all right.

2770
01:55:45,899 --> 01:55:46,380
All right, let's go.

2771
01:55:47,100 --> 01:55:48,140
How to play.

2772
01:55:48,140 --> 01:55:51,100
Much has changed since swords and sandals one.

2773
01:55:51,100 --> 01:55:52,140
Apparently, chat.

2774
01:55:52,699 --> 01:55:54,890
But for those who have played the first game,

2775
01:55:55,449 --> 01:55:57,529
the basic premise is the same.

2776
01:55:58,170 --> 01:56:01,930
Create your gladiator and battle your way to fame and fortune.

2777
01:56:01,930 --> 01:56:04,569
Tooltips will guide you through the specifics of the game.

2778
01:56:04,569 --> 01:56:06,649
But the basic pattern of the game is as follows.

2779
01:56:06,649 --> 01:56:08,729
Create, build up your character,

2780
01:56:09,289 --> 01:56:11,449
buy weapons, armor, spells, and potions,

2781
01:56:11,449 --> 01:56:13,289
defeat gladiators to win experience and gold,

2782
01:56:13,289 --> 01:56:14,489
and then do it all over again.

2783
01:56:14,489 --> 01:56:19,979
Your ultimate aim is to defeat all the arena champions

2784
01:56:19,979 --> 01:56:21,659
and reign as champion yourself.

2785
01:56:21,659 --> 01:56:22,159
All right.

2786
01:56:22,239 --> 01:56:24,189
Great.

2787
01:56:25,930 --> 01:56:31,390
Become a member of the playaholics to save and load characters.

2788
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:35,609
I'm not going to do that.

2789
01:56:35,609 --> 01:56:36,109
Name.

2790
01:56:41,310 --> 01:56:45,800
How about killer?

2791
01:56:46,359 --> 01:56:47,689
The killer.

2792
01:56:50,270 --> 01:56:50,770
Yeah.

2793
01:56:51,470 --> 01:56:52,109
The killer.

2794
01:56:52,670 --> 01:56:58,489
How about um...

2795
01:56:58,489 --> 01:56:58,989
Great.

2796
01:57:03,640 --> 01:57:04,680
Follow me.

2797
01:57:04,680 --> 01:57:05,319
Follow me.

2798
01:57:06,760 --> 01:57:07,260
Follow me.

2799
01:57:07,800 --> 01:57:08,300
Okay.

2800
01:57:30,489 --> 01:57:33,760
Well, I feel like this looks like a self-part character.

2801
01:57:33,760 --> 01:57:34,260
Okay.

2802
01:57:34,720 --> 01:57:36,430
Hairstyle.

2803
01:57:36,430 --> 01:57:37,310
I give him the...

2804
01:57:37,310 --> 01:57:39,229
Wait, I gotta find the German 985.

2805
01:57:42,539 --> 01:57:44,699
These all could be German 985.

2806
01:57:44,699 --> 01:57:45,739
I have different hair every day.

2807
01:57:48,010 --> 01:57:48,510
Um...

2808
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:56,560
No.

2809
01:57:56,560 --> 01:57:57,439
How about just uh...

2810
01:57:58,640 --> 01:58:00,880
I don't know.

2811
01:58:00,880 --> 01:58:02,000
Should I do like the poop hair?

2812
01:58:08,670 --> 01:58:09,789
No, that's too wild.

2813
01:58:13,659 --> 01:58:14,939
Oh, Dragon Ball Z character.

2814
01:58:14,939 --> 01:58:15,439
Yeah.

2815
01:58:15,439 --> 01:58:16,939
It's gonna be one of the Dragon Ball Z characters.

2816
01:58:16,939 --> 01:58:18,539
The ones that like don't fight that much.

2817
01:58:20,829 --> 01:58:21,789
They're like smaller.

2818
01:58:27,390 --> 01:58:28,430
Piccolo fights all the time.

2819
01:58:30,350 --> 01:58:32,189
There's a little green guy that doesn't fight all the time.

2820
01:58:32,189 --> 01:58:32,689
Right?

2821
01:58:33,149 --> 01:58:37,199
Who's the little green guy that doesn't fight?

2822
01:58:37,760 --> 01:58:41,470
Krillin.

2823
01:58:41,470 --> 01:58:41,970
Yeah.

2824
01:58:41,970 --> 01:58:42,750
What color is his hair?

2825
01:58:46,479 --> 01:58:46,979
Dendy?

2826
01:58:47,760 --> 01:58:48,159
Yeah.

2827
01:58:48,159 --> 01:58:48,640
I don't know.

2828
01:58:48,640 --> 01:58:50,239
What color is Dendy's hair?

2829
01:58:50,960 --> 01:58:54,810
Do I have this right?

2830
01:58:55,449 --> 01:58:56,380
Hold on.

2831
01:58:56,380 --> 01:58:56,880
Dendy?

2832
01:58:57,739 --> 01:58:58,239
Dendy.

2833
01:59:01,260 --> 01:59:01,899
Okay, yeah.

2834
01:59:01,899 --> 01:59:02,539
It's this guy.

2835
01:59:04,329 --> 01:59:04,569
No.

2836
01:59:04,569 --> 01:59:05,930
Is it Dendy or is it Krillin?

2837
01:59:07,079 --> 01:59:09,130
Who has like the hair?

2838
01:59:09,130 --> 01:59:09,449
No.

2839
01:59:09,449 --> 01:59:10,409
Krillin does not.

2840
01:59:10,409 --> 01:59:11,050
Yeah, it's Dendy.

2841
01:59:11,050 --> 01:59:13,210
But is there a Dendy with like uh...

2842
01:59:13,210 --> 01:59:14,729
Is there a Dendy with like the hair?

2843
01:59:19,689 --> 01:59:20,090
No.

2844
01:59:20,090 --> 01:59:20,489
Okay.

2845
01:59:20,489 --> 01:59:21,289
I guess whatever.

2846
01:59:23,800 --> 01:59:24,439
I love that.

2847
01:59:25,159 --> 01:59:25,880
I like that.

2848
01:59:25,880 --> 01:59:26,380
Okay.

2849
01:59:27,279 --> 01:59:27,600
Okay.

2850
01:59:27,600 --> 01:59:29,279
Strength, agility, attack.

2851
01:59:29,279 --> 01:59:33,770
Let's just make my character, right?

2852
01:59:33,770 --> 01:59:35,550
Yeah.

2853
01:59:35,550 --> 01:59:35,869
Okay.

2854
01:59:35,869 --> 01:59:36,590
So, um...

2855
01:59:37,550 --> 01:59:38,029
The great...

2856
01:59:38,029 --> 01:59:40,590
The great star, underscore, once said

2857
01:59:40,590 --> 01:59:42,880
that if I had a character sheet in real life,

2858
01:59:44,279 --> 01:59:47,079
every single point would be in luck and charisma

2859
01:59:47,079 --> 01:59:50,010
and I'd have a zero in everything else.

2860
01:59:50,010 --> 01:59:50,729
So I...

2861
01:59:50,729 --> 01:59:52,810
I mean, I don't know how accurate that particularly is.

2862
01:59:54,329 --> 01:59:56,250
But I feel like I'll lose every match.

2863
02:00:02,189 --> 02:00:06,170
I wanted to be kind of strong.

2864
02:00:06,810 --> 02:00:08,270
I don't even know what these do.

2865
02:00:08,270 --> 02:00:08,750
Can I look?

2866
02:00:09,310 --> 02:00:10,729
Strength...

2867
02:00:11,529 --> 02:00:12,090
I definitely need...

2868
02:00:12,810 --> 02:00:13,050
Okay.

2869
02:00:13,050 --> 02:00:14,010
Stamina and vitality.

2870
02:00:14,010 --> 02:00:14,489
What's the difference?

2871
02:00:17,289 --> 02:00:20,970
Five strength, two agility, three attack.

2872
02:00:20,970 --> 02:00:32,909
Is that gonna work?

2873
02:00:33,630 --> 02:00:36,800
I don't think that's gonna do anything.

2874
02:00:37,359 --> 02:00:38,319
I'm gonna probably die.

2875
02:00:38,880 --> 02:00:41,529
Tool tips are at the bottom.

2876
02:00:42,090 --> 02:00:42,569
They are?

2877
02:00:44,329 --> 02:00:44,729
Oh, shit.

2878
02:00:44,729 --> 02:00:45,369
Okay.

2879
02:00:45,369 --> 02:00:48,319
Strength determines how much damage your character dishes out

2880
02:00:48,319 --> 02:00:49,760
and your skill with axes and clubs.

2881
02:00:50,479 --> 02:00:53,039
It also affects the height and weight of your character.

2882
02:00:53,039 --> 02:00:55,199
Stronger characters can push weaker characters further.

2883
02:00:55,199 --> 02:00:57,279
Okay, well, I mean, I'm not the biggest guy in the room,

2884
02:00:57,279 --> 02:00:58,960
but you know, I'm also not the smallest guy in the room,

2885
02:00:58,960 --> 02:01:00,640
but I can keep that at a one.

2886
02:01:01,119 --> 02:01:02,720
Agility represents your character's speed,

2887
02:01:02,720 --> 02:01:04,159
skill with swords and ranged weapons.

2888
02:01:04,159 --> 02:01:06,960
Faster characters can move in and out of combat more easily

2889
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:09,359
and perform spectacular aerobatic leaps.

2890
02:01:09,359 --> 02:01:11,680
Well, with my kind of medical stuff recently,

2891
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:13,199
I haven't been able to move around too much,

2892
02:01:13,199 --> 02:01:14,399
like that fast or that much.

2893
02:01:14,399 --> 02:01:16,829
So having some, you know, trouble layers

2894
02:01:16,829 --> 02:01:17,550
probably should be a one.

2895
02:01:18,649 --> 02:01:18,890
Attack.

2896
02:01:18,890 --> 02:01:20,729
Your attack is overall offensive weapon skill.

2897
02:01:20,729 --> 02:01:22,090
Gladiators with high attack scores

2898
02:01:22,090 --> 02:01:23,689
tend to hit their enemies more often.

2899
02:01:23,689 --> 02:01:25,609
Finding gaps in armor with masterful precision.

2900
02:01:28,760 --> 02:01:30,680
I have trouble like opening up Amazon packages

2901
02:01:30,680 --> 02:01:32,119
with like a pair of scissors.

2902
02:01:32,119 --> 02:01:34,539
I can never quite like cut the tape

2903
02:01:34,539 --> 02:01:36,270
and I end up just ripping it up.

2904
02:01:36,270 --> 02:01:37,390
I just grab the edges

2905
02:01:37,390 --> 02:01:39,710
and I just fucking pull as hard as I can

2906
02:01:39,710 --> 02:01:41,069
and the tape is starting to give,

2907
02:01:41,069 --> 02:01:42,189
but it hasn't given yet

2908
02:01:42,189 --> 02:01:43,789
and I pull as hard as I fucking can

2909
02:01:43,789 --> 02:01:45,149
until it just breaks.

2910
02:01:45,149 --> 02:01:46,890
So I probably wouldn't be very good at that either.

2911
02:01:47,609 --> 02:01:50,569
Defense is a vital part of protecting oneself in combat.

2912
02:01:50,569 --> 02:01:52,170
High defensive stat means you'll get hit less.

2913
02:01:54,729 --> 02:01:57,340
I mean, I do a lot of sitting.

2914
02:01:57,340 --> 02:01:57,899
I just sit here.

2915
02:01:57,899 --> 02:01:59,340
I mean, people could give you through

2916
02:01:59,340 --> 02:02:00,380
like a rock at my window right now.

2917
02:02:00,380 --> 02:02:01,260
It'd go hit me right in the head.

2918
02:02:01,260 --> 02:02:03,979
So I don't think I'd be very good at that either.

2919
02:02:03,979 --> 02:02:05,739
Your vitality represents your overall health.

2920
02:02:06,859 --> 02:02:07,659
That's one.

2921
02:02:07,659 --> 02:02:10,649
Charisma reflects your overall charm and likeability.

2922
02:02:10,649 --> 02:02:13,289
Characters with high charisma please the crowd.

2923
02:02:13,289 --> 02:02:15,449
Winning you more gold for winning fights.

2924
02:02:15,449 --> 02:02:18,090
Shopkeepers will lower their prices by 1%

2925
02:02:18,090 --> 02:02:21,229
for every charisma point you have.

2926
02:02:21,229 --> 02:02:23,550
I feel like I'm right at home here.

2927
02:02:23,550 --> 02:02:25,789
I feel like I can do this pretty well.

2928
02:02:25,789 --> 02:02:27,710
I feel like I have energy sometimes

2929
02:02:27,710 --> 02:02:30,029
and I can really speak to a crowd of people.

2930
02:02:30,029 --> 02:02:31,149
Are you guys ready?

2931
02:02:31,149 --> 02:02:33,229
Are you excited for German 985's

2932
02:02:33,229 --> 02:02:34,189
YouTube account?

2933
02:02:34,189 --> 02:02:35,600
I think it should be 10.

2934
02:02:35,600 --> 02:02:38,159
Stamina.

2935
02:02:38,159 --> 02:02:40,890
Every leap, every parry or hack you perform

2936
02:02:40,890 --> 02:02:43,210
in the area arena takes some of your energy.

2937
02:02:43,210 --> 02:02:45,600
I got some energy.

2938
02:02:45,600 --> 02:02:46,779
Well, no, I don't.

2939
02:02:46,779 --> 02:02:47,979
I stream for like four hours.

2940
02:02:47,979 --> 02:02:50,750
Um, what about magicka?

2941
02:02:50,750 --> 02:02:53,470
You cannot harness the power of magicka in your combats.

2942
02:02:53,470 --> 02:02:55,869
To cast magic spells and potions,

2943
02:02:55,869 --> 02:02:57,149
you'll need a high magicka.

2944
02:02:57,149 --> 02:03:00,760
Each magicka point you have also adds 1% resistance

2945
02:03:00,760 --> 02:03:02,989
to magical damage.

2946
02:03:02,989 --> 02:03:04,029
I don't know, man.

2947
02:03:04,029 --> 02:03:06,989
I kind of feel like, you know, how many times have I,

2948
02:03:06,989 --> 02:03:09,630
you know, like power, like total power.

2949
02:03:10,729 --> 02:03:13,720
I feel like I would be like one of those guys.

2950
02:03:13,720 --> 02:03:14,520
I would just open up.

2951
02:03:14,520 --> 02:03:16,199
I would go into the room with a big robe on

2952
02:03:16,199 --> 02:03:17,800
and I would just tell a bunch of jokes

2953
02:03:17,800 --> 02:03:20,640
and then I would zap everybody to death.

2954
02:03:20,640 --> 02:03:21,439
I think that would be me.

2955
02:03:21,439 --> 02:03:30,720
If I had a D&D character, that's who it would be.

2956
02:03:30,720 --> 02:03:31,920
You are a wizard.

2957
02:03:31,920 --> 02:03:34,960
Well, I don't know if it would be a wizard.

2958
02:03:34,960 --> 02:03:36,239
No, 10 charisma.

2959
02:03:36,239 --> 02:03:38,399
No, I could be like a magic user.

2960
02:03:38,399 --> 02:03:40,479
How could I not be a magic user?

2961
02:03:40,479 --> 02:03:40,880
Fine.

2962
02:03:40,880 --> 02:03:42,970
Nine charisma, two magic.

2963
02:03:42,970 --> 02:03:44,250
Well, this is going to be really funny.

2964
02:03:44,250 --> 02:03:45,449
Laugh out loud streamer joke.

2965
02:03:45,449 --> 02:03:47,920
I can't wait for like this to not go well at all

2966
02:03:47,920 --> 02:03:49,600
and I'm going to die in like the first arena

2967
02:03:49,600 --> 02:03:51,119
and like I'm going to fucking just quit the game

2968
02:03:51,119 --> 02:03:52,680
and we're going to move on.

2969
02:03:52,680 --> 02:03:54,920
Tholomew, yes, that was your name

2970
02:03:54,920 --> 02:03:58,779
but it seems and now here you are languishing in the darkness.

2971
02:03:58,779 --> 02:04:02,890
A forgotten prisoner in the emperor's dungeon.

2972
02:04:02,890 --> 02:04:04,729
Door opens and your eyes are blinded by the light.

2973
02:04:04,729 --> 02:04:06,970
A dark shape appears before you.

2974
02:04:06,970 --> 02:04:11,180
Soldiers, oh, you're in the basement.

2975
02:04:11,180 --> 02:04:12,380
Hey, you get up, worm.

2976
02:04:12,939 --> 02:04:15,739
It is time and boogers are flowing out of this guy's nose

2977
02:04:15,739 --> 02:04:17,579
and he has a plate of bacon in his hand

2978
02:04:17,579 --> 02:04:19,960
and he waves the bacon in front of your face.

2979
02:04:19,960 --> 02:04:22,239
Somebody who, if you know what that is,

2980
02:04:22,239 --> 02:04:24,560
holy shit, you are a long-term viewer.

2981
02:04:24,560 --> 02:04:26,960
It's the fucking copy paste book that I put into the chat

2982
02:04:26,960 --> 02:04:28,000
when I was writing that book.

2983
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,560
And so in a frenzy of blood with a stench of fear,

2984
02:04:30,560 --> 02:04:32,000
your days as a gladiator begin.

2985
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:39,310
Tholomew versus live from the dungeon.

2986
02:04:39,310 --> 02:04:40,510
Fearful prisoner.

2987
02:04:40,510 --> 02:04:44,729
Check out your opponent's armor.

2988
02:04:44,729 --> 02:04:45,689
Okay, stats.

2989
02:04:45,689 --> 02:04:49,470
This guy's got zero in everything.

2990
02:04:49,470 --> 02:04:55,039
Preview, okay, let's go.

2991
02:04:55,039 --> 02:04:57,470
Walk forward, jump forward.

2992
02:05:00,439 --> 02:05:04,380
Wait, is this like, is this how I can tell a joke?

2993
02:05:04,380 --> 02:05:07,260
Taunt enemy, press this to yell taunts at your enemy.

2994
02:05:08,909 --> 02:05:13,100
Just fucking made him angry.

2995
02:05:13,100 --> 02:05:14,300
Let me read these.

2996
02:05:16,090 --> 02:05:18,729
Jump backwards, press this leap to leap out of danger.

2997
02:05:18,729 --> 02:05:21,470
Jumping saps your energy quickly.

2998
02:05:21,470 --> 02:05:22,670
The height and distance of your jump

2999
02:05:22,670 --> 02:05:26,279
is determined by your agility.

3000
02:05:26,279 --> 02:05:28,279
Step away, useful when your health is low,

3001
02:05:28,279 --> 02:05:30,039
but be aware that jumping saps your energy.

3002
02:05:30,039 --> 02:05:32,680
Okay, so it's to get away.

3003
02:05:32,680 --> 02:05:34,279
Jump forward, jumping uses a lot of energy,

3004
02:05:34,279 --> 02:05:36,329
but it's faster, you get closer.

3005
02:05:36,329 --> 02:05:38,439
Or attack, charge enemy.

3006
02:05:38,439 --> 02:05:39,960
Press this to perform an aerobatic,

3007
02:05:43,310 --> 02:05:45,689
an aerobatic, like I'm flying,

3008
02:05:45,689 --> 02:05:46,729
leaping attack at your enemy.

3009
02:05:47,689 --> 02:05:49,770
I missed him.

3010
02:05:52,029 --> 02:05:53,630
How do you block somebody yelling at you?

3011
02:05:53,630 --> 02:05:54,590
Do you just close your ears?

3012
02:05:54,590 --> 02:05:57,119
Do you like plug your ears into your fingers?

3013
02:05:57,119 --> 02:06:01,840
All right, all right, all right, shove him.

3014
02:06:01,840 --> 02:06:03,600
Shove enemy, press this to push your opponent back

3015
02:06:03,600 --> 02:06:06,329
and give yourself some breathing space.

3016
02:06:06,329 --> 02:06:18,779
Power attack, holy shit, okay.

3017
02:06:18,779 --> 02:06:20,989
2,500 gold.

3018
02:06:20,989 --> 02:06:32,119
I leveled up, sick.

3019
02:06:32,119 --> 02:06:33,479
Day one, glorious freedom.

3020
02:06:33,479 --> 02:06:36,510
Your adventure starts here in town square.

3021
02:06:36,510 --> 02:06:37,949
Before you enter the arena,

3022
02:06:37,949 --> 02:06:40,279
you should visit the armory in the weaponsmith

3023
02:06:40,279 --> 02:06:42,439
and stock up on a weapon or some armor.

3024
02:06:42,439 --> 02:06:43,880
Click on one of the buildings nearby to enter

3025
02:06:43,880 --> 02:06:46,039
or click the call scene to jump straight into battle.

3026
02:06:46,039 --> 02:06:47,819
All right, let's go to the armory.

3027
02:06:49,600 --> 02:06:51,680
What sort of armor are you looking for?

3028
02:06:51,680 --> 02:06:53,789
The portrait on the right represents

3029
02:06:53,789 --> 02:06:55,470
the different types of armor you can buy.

3030
02:06:56,029 --> 02:06:58,350
Click an area on your body to see what's available.

3031
02:06:58,350 --> 02:07:02,920
Elmets protect you against critical hit damage

3032
02:07:02,920 --> 02:07:05,079
as well as contributing to your overall defense.

3033
02:07:05,720 --> 02:07:07,449
Shoulder guards increase the chance

3034
02:07:07,449 --> 02:07:09,529
of a charge attack succeeding

3035
02:07:09,529 --> 02:07:11,930
as well as contributing to your overall defense.

3036
02:07:11,930 --> 02:07:14,600
A breastplate converts a percentage of damage

3037
02:07:14,600 --> 02:07:16,439
taken into energy as well as contributing

3038
02:07:16,439 --> 02:07:17,880
to your overall defense.

3039
02:07:17,880 --> 02:07:20,239
A gauntlet increases the distance you can shove

3040
02:07:20,239 --> 02:07:21,680
your enemies as well as contributing

3041
02:07:21,680 --> 02:07:22,640
to your overall defense.

3042
02:07:23,840 --> 02:07:26,640
This thorough thigh guard protects against

3043
02:07:26,640 --> 02:07:27,920
critical hits as well as contributing

3044
02:07:27,920 --> 02:07:28,800
to your overall defense.

3045
02:07:29,439 --> 02:07:31,689
Shields make you hold them up in the air.

3046
02:07:31,689 --> 02:07:34,329
Shin guards you block soccer players.

3047
02:07:34,329 --> 02:07:36,239
Boots increase your movement speed

3048
02:07:36,239 --> 02:07:38,000
and contribute to your overall defense.

3049
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:41,359
Okay, and then over here we have...

3050
02:07:41,359 --> 02:07:42,479
I'm not trying to be funny.

3051
02:07:42,479 --> 02:07:43,279
Stop, I'm not trying to be...

3052
02:07:43,279 --> 02:07:43,840
Everybody get...

3053
02:07:43,840 --> 02:07:46,489
Okay, can I just say something?

3054
02:07:46,489 --> 02:07:47,689
If I go in...

3055
02:07:47,689 --> 02:07:49,979
If I do an English accent,

3056
02:07:49,979 --> 02:07:53,050
you guys just burn your computers.

3057
02:07:53,050 --> 02:07:55,449
It's like this huge triggering thing.

3058
02:07:55,449 --> 02:07:57,039
Like, hi everybody.

3059
02:07:57,039 --> 02:07:58,079
I'm going to do an English accent.

3060
02:07:58,960 --> 02:07:59,920
Break, break my...

3061
02:07:59,920 --> 02:08:01,600
Throw my computer in the fucking trash.

3062
02:08:02,239 --> 02:08:05,279
I could sit...

3063
02:08:05,279 --> 02:08:05,600
I could...

3064
02:08:05,600 --> 02:08:06,880
I could sit here and go like this.

3065
02:08:11,439 --> 02:08:12,880
Yes, yes, do it again.

3066
02:08:12,880 --> 02:08:13,520
Yes.

3067
02:08:13,520 --> 02:08:15,340
Hi everybody.

3068
02:08:15,340 --> 02:08:16,939
I'm just talking with a different accent.

3069
02:08:19,899 --> 02:08:22,079
My whole body's on fire.

3070
02:08:22,079 --> 02:08:29,289
Just use it, cover yourself in a blanket

3071
02:08:29,289 --> 02:08:30,649
and like roll around your room.

3072
02:08:31,449 --> 02:08:34,760
All right, what do I want to do?

3073
02:08:35,640 --> 02:08:36,750
Helmet?

3074
02:08:36,750 --> 02:08:37,949
Ooh, it's a leather helmet.

3075
02:08:38,829 --> 02:08:40,029
Anything but the accent.

3076
02:08:46,010 --> 02:08:52,569
How much is it?

3077
02:08:52,569 --> 02:08:53,069
$1,200?

3078
02:08:53,930 --> 02:08:54,649
If you have enough gold,

3079
02:08:54,649 --> 02:08:56,250
you can buy this item by clicking the tick button

3080
02:08:56,250 --> 02:08:58,090
and it will automatically place on your character.

3081
02:08:58,090 --> 02:08:59,130
Have you changed your mind?

3082
02:08:59,130 --> 02:09:00,810
I wasn't supposed to scream today.

3083
02:09:00,810 --> 02:09:01,449
What the fuck?

3084
02:09:01,449 --> 02:09:02,409
I'm not supposed to be yelling.

3085
02:09:02,409 --> 02:09:03,050
Listen to this now.

3086
02:09:03,050 --> 02:09:03,850
I'm getting a little...

3087
02:09:03,850 --> 02:09:05,130
I'm going to have to take another two days off.

3088
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:07,439
No, the game awards is tomorrow.

3089
02:09:07,439 --> 02:09:08,079
I can't miss it.

3090
02:09:13,930 --> 02:09:16,090
Okay, how do I get the tooltips off for a second?

3091
02:09:16,090 --> 02:09:18,880
30% crit protection adds 20 to your armor.

3092
02:09:19,439 --> 02:09:22,380
Acquired gladiator level.

3093
02:09:22,380 --> 02:09:23,260
It's like Bane.

3094
02:09:23,260 --> 02:09:23,819
When I used to...

3095
02:09:23,819 --> 02:09:24,460
Remember Bane?

3096
02:09:25,100 --> 02:09:26,140
It would go like this,

3097
02:09:26,140 --> 02:09:27,500
and all of a sudden everybody's...

3098
02:09:27,500 --> 02:09:28,779
Oh, everybody's...

3099
02:09:28,779 --> 02:09:38,399
All their entrails would come out.

3100
02:09:38,399 --> 02:09:39,439
Uh, I don't want that.

3101
02:09:39,439 --> 02:09:40,399
I should get a weapon.

3102
02:09:41,600 --> 02:09:42,489
What the fuck?

3103
02:09:43,050 --> 02:09:44,000
What's going on?

3104
02:09:49,210 --> 02:09:50,409
Louis D. Lungeville,

3105
02:09:50,409 --> 02:09:51,050
master at arms.

3106
02:09:51,050 --> 02:09:52,010
Can I interest you in a weapon?

3107
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,079
Slashing weapons are truly the weapon of the gentleman.

3108
02:09:55,079 --> 02:09:56,199
They require high agility.

3109
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,960
What's the weapon of the charisma?

3110
02:09:59,960 --> 02:10:00,680
A microphone?

3111
02:10:01,930 --> 02:10:04,170
Hacking weapons are great for slicing.

3112
02:10:04,170 --> 02:10:05,289
They require high strength.

3113
02:10:05,930 --> 02:10:08,090
High strength?

3114
02:10:11,449 --> 02:10:12,329
Okay, I need, um...

3115
02:10:12,329 --> 02:10:13,930
I need like a staff.

3116
02:10:13,930 --> 02:10:14,250
I have...

3117
02:10:14,250 --> 02:10:15,529
What was a magic thing I can use?

3118
02:10:18,989 --> 02:10:19,869
Why does everybody get so mad?

3119
02:10:19,869 --> 02:10:19,949
I...

3120
02:10:19,949 --> 02:10:20,109
What?

3121
02:10:20,109 --> 02:10:21,869
Did I do an accent to these people?

3122
02:10:23,319 --> 02:10:23,640
Sorry.

3123
02:10:24,510 --> 02:10:26,350
I did an English accent for five seconds.

3124
02:10:26,350 --> 02:10:26,989
Nobody kill me.

3125
02:10:28,560 --> 02:10:29,199
Magic shop.

3126
02:10:29,760 --> 02:10:32,220
Welcome to the magic shop.

3127
02:10:32,220 --> 02:10:33,020
Don't steal anything.

3128
02:10:33,020 --> 02:10:33,659
Okay, spells.

3129
02:10:34,300 --> 02:10:37,260
Teleport to a random spot.

3130
02:10:37,260 --> 02:10:38,140
Gale.

3131
02:10:38,140 --> 02:10:41,579
A gust of wind that knocks your opponent back a great distance.

3132
02:10:41,579 --> 02:10:43,020
Oh, shit.

3133
02:10:43,020 --> 02:10:50,140
Enchant weapon?

3134
02:10:50,140 --> 02:10:51,600
Burn your...

3135
02:10:51,600 --> 02:10:52,560
A flame weapon?

3136
02:10:52,560 --> 02:10:53,279
I don't have a weapon.

3137
02:10:53,840 --> 02:10:56,729
I could put it on a rusty knife.

3138
02:11:02,960 --> 02:11:03,279
What?

3139
02:11:04,140 --> 02:11:04,619
Nightfall.

3140
02:11:04,619 --> 02:11:06,460
The hours late and the town quiets.

3141
02:11:06,460 --> 02:11:07,659
You find yourself growing weary.

3142
02:11:07,659 --> 02:11:09,659
Will you brave the streets to spend some gold?

3143
02:11:09,659 --> 02:11:10,619
I didn't buy anything.

3144
02:11:12,560 --> 02:11:14,000
Uh, I need to go to bed.

3145
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:17,659
You make your way to the Cozy Nook,

3146
02:11:17,659 --> 02:11:19,680
a tavern in the merchant's quarter.

3147
02:11:19,680 --> 02:11:21,359
Paying the innkeeper 250 gold pieces,

3148
02:11:21,359 --> 02:11:22,560
you're shown to a comfortable room

3149
02:11:22,560 --> 02:11:24,159
with a view of the forest to the east.

3150
02:11:24,720 --> 02:11:26,159
Just leave this peaceful and awake feeling

3151
02:11:26,159 --> 02:11:27,520
ready to take the world again.

3152
02:11:27,520 --> 02:11:31,289
I wasted time browsing around.

3153
02:11:31,289 --> 02:11:31,529
Okay.

3154
02:11:33,550 --> 02:11:33,949
I need...

3155
02:11:34,670 --> 02:11:36,350
I need a weapon or something.

3156
02:11:36,350 --> 02:11:37,229
I should buy something.

3157
02:11:37,789 --> 02:11:41,850
I buy, like, a dagger and...

3158
02:11:42,649 --> 02:11:43,449
Enchant it?

3159
02:11:43,449 --> 02:11:46,880
Let's just go.

3160
02:11:46,880 --> 02:11:47,680
Whatever.

3161
02:11:47,680 --> 02:11:51,369
I am Arglax, Overlord of the Arena.

3162
02:11:51,369 --> 02:11:51,770
What kind of...

3163
02:11:51,770 --> 02:11:53,529
What sort of fighter are you after?

3164
02:11:53,529 --> 02:11:56,350
The next tournament is for Gladius level 4.

3165
02:11:56,350 --> 02:11:57,149
A duel.

3166
02:11:57,149 --> 02:12:00,590
Okay.

3167
02:12:00,590 --> 02:12:04,329
This person is just me, but way better.

3168
02:12:04,329 --> 02:12:12,600
He's just got a bigger chest and got a helmet.

3169
02:12:12,600 --> 02:12:12,920
He's a...

3170
02:12:16,829 --> 02:12:18,840
What do I do to him?

3171
02:12:18,840 --> 02:12:20,199
Oh, go, go, go, go, go, go.

3172
02:12:20,199 --> 02:12:21,159
All right, let's go.

3173
02:12:21,159 --> 02:12:23,369
You get seven armor, he's got 40 health.

3174
02:12:23,369 --> 02:12:24,170
I got more health than him.

3175
02:12:25,050 --> 02:12:29,369
Like, what, I beat him?

3176
02:12:30,010 --> 02:12:41,180
He yielded.

3177
02:12:41,180 --> 02:12:42,699
Okay, you gained a new ability.

3178
02:12:42,699 --> 02:12:43,659
Win the crowd.

3179
02:12:43,659 --> 02:12:46,060
It allows you to gain more gold from fights.

3180
02:12:46,060 --> 02:12:54,300
Okay, I got money now.

3181
02:12:54,300 --> 02:12:54,859
Weaponsmith.

3182
02:12:55,420 --> 02:12:57,960
I need just something to enchant.

3183
02:12:58,520 --> 02:13:04,430
No, should I get Gale?

3184
02:13:04,430 --> 02:13:05,310
I think I'm gonna get Gale.

3185
02:13:09,390 --> 02:13:10,109
Gale.

3186
02:13:10,109 --> 02:13:11,149
37, 40.

3187
02:13:11,149 --> 02:13:11,869
Shit.

3188
02:13:11,869 --> 02:13:19,920
I'm gonna enchant my weapon with flame.

3189
02:13:19,920 --> 02:13:22,960
Your opponent will miss a turn writhing burning pain.

3190
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:26,699
Frost, your opponent will miss a turn frozen to the ground.

3191
02:13:26,699 --> 02:13:27,979
The power of venom.

3192
02:13:27,979 --> 02:13:32,569
How much does it cost to do this?

3193
02:13:32,569 --> 02:13:34,670
It costs zero gold.

3194
02:13:35,229 --> 02:13:37,689
Oh, it's range only?

3195
02:13:38,409 --> 02:13:40,060
Don't waste the money.

3196
02:13:42,060 --> 02:13:44,380
What's in the church?

3197
02:13:44,380 --> 02:13:45,420
Welcome, you will find peace here.

3198
02:13:45,420 --> 02:13:47,100
Do you require the church's aid and your soul saved?

3199
02:13:47,100 --> 02:13:48,539
I guess you can just buy potions.

3200
02:13:48,539 --> 02:14:06,079
I'm just like juggling.

3201
02:14:10,329 --> 02:14:11,609
The crowd is bored.

3202
02:14:27,260 --> 02:14:29,039
Oh, shit.

3203
02:14:31,340 --> 02:14:32,840
Look at his face.

3204
02:14:34,779 --> 02:14:37,260
You have the forehead of a 400 gold?

3205
02:14:37,260 --> 02:14:38,220
What the fuck?

3206
02:14:41,920 --> 02:14:43,279
Buy armor, you dummy.

3207
02:14:43,279 --> 02:14:46,350
All right, I'm gonna buy a leather helmet.

3208
02:14:46,350 --> 02:14:47,229
Buy it.

3209
02:14:47,229 --> 02:14:48,829
Okay, I have a leather helmet.

3210
02:14:48,829 --> 02:14:53,000
I have shoulder pads.

3211
02:14:53,560 --> 02:14:56,880
Is this just skin?

3212
02:14:56,880 --> 02:14:58,560
All right, and breastplate.

3213
02:15:02,750 --> 02:15:04,029
Okay, I'm gonna get my money back.

3214
02:15:04,670 --> 02:15:09,239
What do you got?

3215
02:15:10,810 --> 02:15:11,449
He's terrible.

3216
02:15:11,449 --> 02:15:12,329
His hit points are 100.

3217
02:15:12,329 --> 02:15:13,289
He's got terrible strength.

3218
02:15:13,289 --> 02:15:14,729
I'm gonna scream at his face and win.

3219
02:15:14,729 --> 02:15:15,130
Let's go.

3220
02:15:15,130 --> 02:15:16,170
All right, get the crowd behind me.

3221
02:15:22,520 --> 02:15:26,510
How much money did I get?

3222
02:15:26,510 --> 02:15:27,390
Do it again.

3223
02:15:27,390 --> 02:15:31,319
This is level three.

3224
02:15:31,319 --> 02:15:31,960
Give me some more money.

3225
02:15:31,960 --> 02:15:32,760
Go.

3226
02:15:32,760 --> 02:15:36,079
Oh, shit.

3227
02:15:36,079 --> 02:15:42,189
All right, back it up, back it up, back it up.

3228
02:15:42,189 --> 02:15:46,520
Okay.

3229
02:15:49,659 --> 02:15:49,979
Shit.

3230
02:15:52,760 --> 02:15:53,239
Come on.

3231
02:15:57,439 --> 02:15:57,920
What happened?

3232
02:15:58,880 --> 02:16:01,340
Oh god, oh god, oh god.

3233
02:16:01,340 --> 02:16:02,859
Uh, I win.

3234
02:16:02,859 --> 02:16:15,100
What do I do?

3235
02:16:15,739 --> 02:16:21,529
Okay, I need more.

3236
02:16:21,529 --> 02:16:22,090
I need a weapon.

3237
02:16:24,479 --> 02:16:26,079
I'm just gonna get a sword or something, man.

3238
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:27,850
I'm gonna get a dagger.

3239
02:16:29,050 --> 02:16:29,930
I can't buy anything.

3240
02:16:29,930 --> 02:16:31,130
I need three agility.

3241
02:16:31,850 --> 02:16:38,680
I can't even get a slingshot.

3242
02:16:38,680 --> 02:16:43,579
Okay, I'm going for agility next time.

3243
02:16:43,579 --> 02:16:50,600
Breastplate.

3244
02:16:51,159 --> 02:16:51,959
32 armor.

3245
02:16:52,600 --> 02:17:00,840
Okay.

3246
02:17:01,479 --> 02:17:02,360
Nightfall.

3247
02:17:02,360 --> 02:17:04,040
All right, find a tavern.

3248
02:17:04,040 --> 02:17:11,079
Okay, go to the arena.

3249
02:17:11,639 --> 02:17:13,549
It's time for the tournament.

3250
02:17:13,549 --> 02:17:15,500
Once you enter a tournament,

3251
02:17:15,500 --> 02:17:17,579
you cannot return to the town until you are victorious.

3252
02:17:17,579 --> 02:17:19,100
To lose a fight is death.

3253
02:17:19,739 --> 02:17:22,799
Okay.

3254
02:17:25,440 --> 02:17:28,159
John the Butcher Woldridge is a pillar of the community.

3255
02:17:28,159 --> 02:17:32,479
Every year, he hosts a tournament for low-level gladiators to gain valuable experience.

3256
02:17:32,479 --> 02:17:36,799
The winner even gets to take on Woldridge himself for a short shot of big prize money.

3257
02:17:39,680 --> 02:17:40,479
I'm level four.

3258
02:17:40,479 --> 02:17:43,280
I'm four, I'm two levels higher than Poseidon.

3259
02:17:56,319 --> 02:17:57,360
I'm gonna get the crowd behind me.

3260
02:17:57,920 --> 02:17:58,719
Crowd's indifferent.

3261
02:18:00,280 --> 02:18:01,479
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3262
02:18:01,479 --> 02:18:04,649
Oh, I'm fine, fine, fine.

3263
02:18:04,649 --> 02:18:05,129
Interested?

3264
02:18:06,200 --> 02:18:06,600
It's okay.

3265
02:18:09,159 --> 02:18:09,799
Entertained.

3266
02:18:13,600 --> 02:18:14,479
Enthusiastic.

3267
02:18:15,040 --> 02:18:16,079
All right, now scream at him.

3268
02:18:16,799 --> 02:18:23,610
What just happened?

3269
02:18:24,250 --> 02:18:28,059
Come on.

3270
02:18:28,059 --> 02:18:37,309
He fell, he fell, he fell.

3271
02:18:37,309 --> 02:18:37,709
That was funny.

3272
02:18:37,709 --> 02:18:38,430
The crowd liked that.

3273
02:18:38,430 --> 02:18:38,989
Back up.

3274
02:18:38,989 --> 02:18:51,520
He's cutting my limbs off.

3275
02:18:56,379 --> 02:18:57,020
I won.

3276
02:18:57,020 --> 02:19:02,889
Oh, shit.

3277
02:19:02,889 --> 02:19:03,209
Nice.

3278
02:19:03,209 --> 02:19:03,450
Okay.

3279
02:19:10,780 --> 02:19:14,440
I'm blocking that shit.

3280
02:19:21,600 --> 02:19:22,639
Rest and heal.

3281
02:19:23,280 --> 02:19:49,579
Oh, am I hitting him with a sandwich?

3282
02:19:49,579 --> 02:19:50,620
I don't even have a weapon.

3283
02:20:00,120 --> 02:20:00,600
Come on.

3284
02:20:02,569 --> 02:20:03,049
There it is.

3285
02:20:10,239 --> 02:20:10,479
What?

3286
02:20:12,200 --> 02:20:13,559
How are you blocking this?

3287
02:20:13,559 --> 02:20:14,440
Ow, that hurt.

3288
02:20:24,159 --> 02:20:24,879
Fuck, come on.

3289
02:20:30,159 --> 02:20:31,360
Back up, back up, back up, back up.

3290
02:20:31,360 --> 02:20:31,920
I need to sleep.

3291
02:20:37,200 --> 02:20:37,520
No.

3292
02:20:48,329 --> 02:20:49,370
Come on, please.

3293
02:20:58,010 --> 02:20:58,329
No.

3294
02:20:59,979 --> 02:21:01,020
Come on, dude.

3295
02:21:11,719 --> 02:21:14,040
All right, I want to play a real one.

3296
02:21:14,040 --> 02:21:15,159
Let me play a real one.

3297
02:21:18,969 --> 02:21:20,409
Play again, play again, play again, play again.

3298
02:21:20,409 --> 02:21:21,290
All right, I'm going to do a real one.

3299
02:21:21,290 --> 02:21:21,770
I'm going to do a real one.

3300
02:21:21,770 --> 02:21:23,049
I'm going to do a real one.

3301
02:21:23,049 --> 02:21:33,360
I don't know.

3302
02:21:33,360 --> 02:21:33,920
I don't know.

3303
02:21:33,920 --> 02:21:34,399
I don't know.

3304
02:21:34,399 --> 02:21:34,959
I don't know.

3305
02:21:34,959 --> 02:21:35,760
Okay, I don't know.

3306
02:21:35,760 --> 02:21:36,239
I don't know.

3307
02:21:36,239 --> 02:21:36,959
I don't know.

3308
02:21:36,959 --> 02:21:37,760
I don't know.

3309
02:21:37,760 --> 02:21:39,129
I don't know.

3310
02:21:39,129 --> 02:21:39,530
I don't know.

3311
02:21:39,930 --> 02:21:40,729
This guy, okay.

3312
02:21:42,780 --> 02:21:50,989
Uh, is it a guy from Star Fox?

3313
02:21:51,549 --> 02:21:53,959
Is it a guy from Star Fox?

3314
02:21:54,520 --> 02:21:59,079
Pigma.

3315
02:21:59,079 --> 02:22:07,340
Okay, I'm going to do this for real.

3316
02:22:08,760 --> 02:22:09,559
I want strength.

3317
02:22:09,559 --> 02:22:10,200
I want attack.

3318
02:22:11,639 --> 02:22:12,280
Get rid of the magic.

3319
02:22:12,280 --> 02:22:12,760
I don't care.

3320
02:22:12,760 --> 02:22:13,159
Attack.

3321
02:22:14,540 --> 02:22:15,100
Vitality.

3322
02:22:15,100 --> 02:22:15,979
Agility.

3323
02:22:15,979 --> 02:22:16,379
Let's go.

3324
02:22:16,940 --> 02:22:17,340
Ow.

3325
02:22:19,680 --> 02:22:20,319
Pigma.

3326
02:22:21,520 --> 02:22:22,559
No, don't you dare.

3327
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:26,600
Oh, I'll do it.

3328
02:22:30,680 --> 02:22:31,719
That's worse noise contender.

3329
02:22:31,719 --> 02:22:32,520
Fuck, I'm in trouble.

3330
02:22:33,079 --> 02:22:33,879
I'm in trouble, I'm in trouble.

3331
02:22:34,280 --> 02:22:35,559
That was like worse noise contender.

3332
02:22:36,200 --> 02:22:37,799
No, by the way, it's too late.

3333
02:22:37,799 --> 02:22:38,920
You know how December is the month,

3334
02:22:38,920 --> 02:22:40,040
like halfway through December?

3335
02:22:42,959 --> 02:22:44,000
You can't nominate that anymore

3336
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:45,680
because we're like too far in December.

3337
02:22:45,680 --> 02:22:55,520
All right, let's just,

3338
02:22:55,520 --> 02:22:56,399
let's smoke this guy.

3339
02:23:13,850 --> 02:23:14,729
Low charisma.

3340
02:23:14,729 --> 02:23:15,290
I know.

3341
02:23:15,290 --> 02:23:15,930
What the fuck?

3342
02:23:16,649 --> 02:23:22,159
What are they saying?

3343
02:23:26,280 --> 02:23:27,000
Gladiator.

3344
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:27,959
Gladiator's off.

3345
02:23:27,959 --> 02:23:28,920
Gladiator's off.

3346
02:23:28,920 --> 02:23:29,959
Gladiator's off.

3347
02:23:29,959 --> 02:23:30,840
Gladiator's off.

3348
02:23:31,719 --> 02:23:33,290
Gladiator's off.

3349
02:23:33,290 --> 02:23:34,170
I hit Gladiator's off.

3350
02:23:34,809 --> 02:23:35,290
Gladiator's off.

3351
02:23:35,290 --> 02:23:36,170
Gladiator's off.

3352
02:23:37,209 --> 02:23:37,930
I don't know.

3353
02:23:37,930 --> 02:23:39,610
All right, give me a dagger.

3354
02:23:40,250 --> 02:23:46,430
Graded nine slashing damage.

3355
02:23:47,309 --> 02:23:47,870
I'll take it.

3356
02:23:48,430 --> 02:23:49,719
Let's go.

3357
02:23:50,440 --> 02:23:51,959
Start stabbing.

3358
02:23:51,959 --> 02:23:56,010
It's time for a duel.

3359
02:23:56,809 --> 02:23:58,670
Here we go.

3360
02:23:58,670 --> 02:23:59,469
Scream.

3361
02:23:59,469 --> 02:24:00,190
Get a man.

3362
02:24:00,190 --> 02:24:00,750
What's that club?

3363
02:24:00,750 --> 02:24:01,790
He's gonna enchant a club.

3364
02:24:08,639 --> 02:24:08,879
What?

3365
02:24:09,600 --> 02:24:19,260
What the fuck just happened?

3366
02:24:19,979 --> 02:24:24,559
How much money is this?

3367
02:24:24,559 --> 02:24:25,440
I can't even afford this.

3368
02:24:26,559 --> 02:24:28,090
Get armor, you idiot.

3369
02:24:28,969 --> 02:24:29,209
I will.

3370
02:24:43,129 --> 02:24:43,770
We're good.

3371
02:24:43,770 --> 02:24:48,379
Okay, now I'm gonna get armor.

3372
02:24:49,020 --> 02:24:50,969
Gladiator's off.

3373
02:24:50,969 --> 02:24:51,930
Gladiator's off.

3374
02:24:51,930 --> 02:24:53,559
Gladiator's off.

3375
02:24:53,559 --> 02:24:54,760
Gladiator's off.

3376
02:24:54,760 --> 02:24:55,079
All right.

3377
02:24:59,209 --> 02:25:00,489
All right, strength and attack.

3378
02:25:05,479 --> 02:25:06,360
Wash your ears.

3379
02:25:08,170 --> 02:25:09,129
Wash your ears?

3380
02:25:09,129 --> 02:25:09,850
They're filthy.

3381
02:25:10,569 --> 02:25:13,690
Shoulder guards.

3382
02:25:14,409 --> 02:25:14,969
Okay.

3383
02:25:14,969 --> 02:25:15,690
All right.

3384
02:25:15,690 --> 02:25:22,200
I need a better weapon though.

3385
02:25:22,200 --> 02:25:22,520
All right.

3386
02:25:22,520 --> 02:25:23,879
I'm gonna try to make money for a weapon.

3387
02:25:30,299 --> 02:25:31,180
All right, let's get in closer.

3388
02:25:32,969 --> 02:25:33,370
Closer.

3389
02:25:35,079 --> 02:25:35,399
Nice.

3390
02:25:35,399 --> 02:25:35,799
Good trick.

3391
02:25:44,600 --> 02:25:45,799
What can I get for a weapon?

3392
02:25:47,959 --> 02:25:48,760
High agility.

3393
02:25:49,319 --> 02:25:50,200
High strength.

3394
02:25:50,200 --> 02:25:50,680
Okay.

3395
02:25:50,680 --> 02:25:51,879
So this is 22.

3396
02:25:52,680 --> 02:25:53,629
28.

3397
02:25:53,629 --> 02:25:54,590
All right, let's get a few more.

3398
02:25:54,590 --> 02:25:55,149
We'll get an axe.

3399
02:25:57,340 --> 02:26:05,739
All right, get in.

3400
02:26:10,409 --> 02:26:11,040
Shit.

3401
02:26:11,040 --> 02:26:12,239
See, I blocked it.

3402
02:26:12,239 --> 02:26:12,559
Power.

3403
02:26:14,459 --> 02:26:14,780
Power.

3404
02:26:18,680 --> 02:26:19,000
Charge.

3405
02:26:21,370 --> 02:26:22,649
What the fuck, dude?

3406
02:26:23,530 --> 02:26:34,139
God damn it.

3407
02:26:34,139 --> 02:26:39,159
The child in the mill.

3408
02:26:39,159 --> 02:26:41,000
You are approached by a frantic woman.

3409
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:41,639
Please help me.

3410
02:26:41,639 --> 02:26:43,879
My only child was playing in the old mill

3411
02:26:43,879 --> 02:26:46,120
and is trapped under some heavy wooden blocks.

3412
02:26:46,120 --> 02:26:47,079
I cannot free him.

3413
02:26:47,639 --> 02:26:49,639
You help the rescue of the child or decline and get about...

3414
02:26:49,639 --> 02:26:50,680
Yeah, let's rescue the child.

3415
02:26:51,479 --> 02:26:52,840
You follow the woman to the mill

3416
02:26:52,840 --> 02:26:54,440
and get to work with the rescue effort.

3417
02:26:54,440 --> 02:26:56,360
Although it takes an hour and most of your strength,

3418
02:26:56,360 --> 02:26:57,479
eventually the child is free.

3419
02:26:58,040 --> 02:26:59,319
You become a hero.

3420
02:26:59,319 --> 02:27:00,760
In both the mother and the child's eyes,

3421
02:27:00,760 --> 02:27:02,440
you gain three charisma points.

3422
02:27:03,159 --> 02:27:03,979
Oh, shit.

3423
02:27:03,979 --> 02:27:06,969
Nice.

3424
02:27:06,969 --> 02:27:08,489
I have to win a battle.

3425
02:27:08,489 --> 02:27:10,639
I have no money to buy anything.

3426
02:27:10,639 --> 02:27:11,280
All right, duel.

3427
02:27:11,280 --> 02:27:11,680
Come on.

3428
02:27:12,239 --> 02:27:13,420
What do you have?

3429
02:27:14,639 --> 02:27:16,479
Shin guards and a shoulder guard.

3430
02:27:16,479 --> 02:27:16,719
Okay.

3431
02:27:17,440 --> 02:27:20,040
Four to 16.

3432
02:27:20,040 --> 02:27:21,000
You guys got a cleaver.

3433
02:27:21,639 --> 02:27:26,559
Hey, Dallas O'Leary is the patron saint.

3434
02:27:26,559 --> 02:27:27,120
I'm gonna lose.

3435
02:27:27,120 --> 02:27:27,920
Let's get in.

3436
02:27:27,920 --> 02:27:32,750
Rest.

3437
02:27:42,670 --> 02:27:47,180
Okay, he fell.

3438
02:27:47,180 --> 02:27:48,139
Now we go in.

3439
02:27:49,579 --> 02:27:50,139
Normal.

3440
02:27:50,139 --> 02:27:50,620
Good.

3441
02:27:50,620 --> 02:27:52,120
All right.

3442
02:27:52,120 --> 02:27:52,440
All right.

3443
02:27:52,440 --> 02:27:52,760
Okay.

3444
02:27:52,760 --> 02:27:53,159
All right.

3445
02:27:53,159 --> 02:27:53,639
Back it up.

3446
02:27:53,639 --> 02:27:54,120
Back it up.

3447
02:27:54,120 --> 02:27:55,319
Rest and heal.

3448
02:27:55,319 --> 02:27:56,760
Get the energy back.

3449
02:27:56,760 --> 02:27:57,319
Back it up again.

3450
02:27:58,120 --> 02:27:58,680
Lunge.

3451
02:28:03,209 --> 02:28:03,690
Shit.

3452
02:28:03,690 --> 02:28:04,489
Okay, we're fine.

3453
02:28:05,690 --> 02:28:06,489
All right.

3454
02:28:06,489 --> 02:28:12,280
What should I put this into?

3455
02:28:12,280 --> 02:28:13,079
Seriously.

3456
02:28:13,079 --> 02:28:14,040
Attack?

3457
02:28:14,040 --> 02:28:15,959
Let me look at this again.

3458
02:28:16,760 --> 02:28:18,040
Vitality?

3459
02:28:18,440 --> 02:28:26,200
Yeah.

3460
02:28:26,200 --> 02:28:26,840
Okay.

3461
02:28:26,840 --> 02:28:30,329
How much money do I have now?

3462
02:28:30,329 --> 02:28:33,549
Enough for an axe?

3463
02:28:34,190 --> 02:28:34,909
17.

3464
02:28:34,909 --> 02:28:35,149
Nope.

3465
02:28:35,149 --> 02:28:36,600
I don't have enough money.

3466
02:28:36,840 --> 02:28:37,079
Nope.

3467
02:28:37,079 --> 02:28:37,959
I don't have enough for an axe.

3468
02:28:39,319 --> 02:28:40,120
I have to win another...

3469
02:28:40,120 --> 02:28:41,000
I have to win another one.

3470
02:28:42,280 --> 02:28:43,959
Oh, god damn it.

3471
02:28:43,959 --> 02:28:47,340
I'm gonna have to do this again.

3472
02:28:47,340 --> 02:28:48,379
Can I sell something?

3473
02:28:48,940 --> 02:28:56,170
I've got to get a...

3474
02:28:57,290 --> 02:29:00,120
Go to the church and save the game?

3475
02:29:04,590 --> 02:29:05,149
Fuck.

3476
02:29:05,149 --> 02:29:13,260
Are the graphics on medium?

3477
02:29:13,260 --> 02:29:13,500
Yeah.

3478
02:29:13,500 --> 02:29:14,059
What the hell?

3479
02:29:16,829 --> 02:29:18,030
Save your character.

3480
02:29:18,030 --> 02:29:18,430
Oh, shit.

3481
02:29:18,430 --> 02:29:18,909
There we go.

3482
02:29:21,180 --> 02:29:21,819
Wait.

3483
02:29:21,819 --> 02:29:22,219
Do you want...

3484
02:29:22,219 --> 02:29:24,299
The church can save your soul for 40 gold.

3485
02:29:24,299 --> 02:29:25,899
Do I want playaholics to load?

3486
02:29:25,899 --> 02:29:26,620
Oh my god.

3487
02:29:34,520 --> 02:29:35,239
I just have to win.

3488
02:29:35,799 --> 02:29:37,469
I'm not gonna be able to win.

3489
02:29:37,469 --> 02:29:38,829
I bought the wrong weapon.

3490
02:29:42,120 --> 02:29:44,239
Can I afford any armor?

3491
02:29:44,959 --> 02:29:45,920
What about a shield?

3492
02:29:45,920 --> 02:29:47,120
Or just even just a little one?

3493
02:29:47,120 --> 02:29:47,840
Nope.

3494
02:29:47,840 --> 02:29:51,629
What about gauntlets?

3495
02:29:52,510 --> 02:29:53,790
I can afford gauntlets.

3496
02:29:55,639 --> 02:29:56,280
Want any armor?

3497
02:29:56,840 --> 02:29:59,209
What is your armor?

3498
02:29:59,209 --> 02:29:59,450
Yeah.

3499
02:29:59,450 --> 02:29:59,850
Okay.

3500
02:29:59,850 --> 02:30:00,649
I have to get something.

3501
02:30:01,290 --> 02:30:06,969
All right.

3502
02:30:06,969 --> 02:30:07,450
Just win.

3503
02:30:07,450 --> 02:30:07,850
Just win.

3504
02:30:08,649 --> 02:30:13,920
I've got more health.

3505
02:30:13,920 --> 02:30:14,799
I've got more armor.

3506
02:30:14,799 --> 02:30:16,079
And I just have to kill him.

3507
02:30:19,200 --> 02:30:19,920
Oh.

3508
02:30:19,920 --> 02:30:21,040
Good start.

3509
02:30:21,040 --> 02:30:21,440
All right.

3510
02:30:21,440 --> 02:30:21,760
Power.

3511
02:30:24,969 --> 02:30:25,290
Lunch.

3512
02:30:27,520 --> 02:30:27,920
Normal.

3513
02:30:31,149 --> 02:30:32,270
Stop.

3514
02:30:32,270 --> 02:30:32,829
Lunch.

3515
02:30:32,829 --> 02:30:33,069
Okay.

3516
02:30:33,069 --> 02:30:33,389
I won.

3517
02:30:34,270 --> 02:30:34,909
1000 gold.

3518
02:30:39,069 --> 02:30:39,629
Okay.

3519
02:30:39,629 --> 02:30:39,950
Shit.

3520
02:30:39,950 --> 02:30:40,590
I'm not gonna win.

3521
02:30:41,389 --> 02:30:43,360
He's got 18 armor.

3522
02:30:43,360 --> 02:30:44,159
He's got an axe.

3523
02:30:44,159 --> 02:30:45,280
He's got an enchanted axe.

3524
02:30:50,110 --> 02:30:51,120
Come on.

3525
02:30:51,120 --> 02:30:52,079
Let me get lucky here.

3526
02:30:56,479 --> 02:30:56,959
Don't you...

3527
02:30:56,959 --> 02:30:57,600
Don't...

3528
02:30:57,600 --> 02:30:57,680
You...

3529
02:30:57,680 --> 02:30:58,319
Don't pull...

3530
02:30:58,319 --> 02:30:58,959
Get over here.

3531
02:30:58,959 --> 02:30:59,520
Get over here.

3532
02:30:59,520 --> 02:31:00,159
Don't pull that out.

3533
02:31:02,780 --> 02:31:03,309
Yeah.

3534
02:31:03,309 --> 02:31:03,790
I was gonna say.

3535
02:31:03,790 --> 02:31:04,350
Give me a break.

3536
02:31:05,389 --> 02:31:06,110
Good.

3537
02:31:06,110 --> 02:31:06,590
Lunch again.

3538
02:31:08,159 --> 02:31:08,719
Back it up.

3539
02:31:08,719 --> 02:31:10,520
Sleep.

3540
02:31:10,520 --> 02:31:10,840
Lunch.

3541
02:31:13,530 --> 02:31:14,409
What happened?

3542
02:31:14,409 --> 02:31:14,729
Power.

3543
02:31:17,959 --> 02:31:18,520
Good.

3544
02:31:18,520 --> 02:31:21,639
Okay.

3545
02:31:21,639 --> 02:31:22,040
All right.

3546
02:31:22,040 --> 02:31:22,840
All right.

3547
02:31:22,840 --> 02:31:23,870
Just a couple more.

3548
02:31:24,750 --> 02:31:25,149
Behold.

3549
02:31:25,149 --> 02:31:25,950
Arena champion.

3550
02:31:25,950 --> 02:31:31,319
John the Butcher.

3551
02:31:31,319 --> 02:31:32,040
Oh, shit.

3552
02:31:32,040 --> 02:31:32,440
All right.

3553
02:31:32,440 --> 02:31:32,760
Okay.

3554
02:31:39,319 --> 02:31:39,639
Back up.

3555
02:31:39,639 --> 02:31:39,959
Back up.

3556
02:31:39,959 --> 02:31:40,280
Back up.

3557
02:31:40,280 --> 02:31:40,600
Run away.

3558
02:31:41,959 --> 02:31:47,129
Back up.

3559
02:31:47,129 --> 02:31:47,610
Run.

3560
02:31:47,610 --> 02:31:47,850
Shove.

3561
02:31:51,979 --> 02:31:52,379
Sleep.

3562
02:31:52,379 --> 02:31:52,700
Black.

3563
02:31:52,700 --> 02:31:53,340
Back up.

3564
02:31:53,340 --> 02:31:53,659
Back up.

3565
02:31:57,850 --> 02:31:59,370
His energy is so much higher than mine.

3566
02:32:00,329 --> 02:32:00,569
Fine.

3567
02:32:00,569 --> 02:32:00,889
That's okay.

3568
02:32:03,069 --> 02:32:03,469
Good.

3569
02:32:03,469 --> 02:32:03,790
Good.

3570
02:32:05,959 --> 02:32:06,600
Fuck.

3571
02:32:06,600 --> 02:32:07,399
No.

3572
02:32:07,399 --> 02:32:08,040
Don't kill me.

3573
02:32:15,840 --> 02:32:16,879
75 stamina pot.

3574
02:32:16,879 --> 02:32:17,040
Huh?

3575
02:32:17,040 --> 02:32:17,280
Wait.

3576
02:32:17,280 --> 02:32:18,079
I didn't have the stamina pot.

3577
02:32:18,079 --> 02:32:18,399
What?

3578
02:32:20,120 --> 02:32:21,879
What?

3579
02:32:21,879 --> 02:32:24,440
What?

3580
02:32:24,440 --> 02:32:25,000
What?

3581
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:31,450
What?

3582
02:32:31,450 --> 02:32:34,239
Ah.

3583
02:32:34,239 --> 02:32:36,000
No.

3584
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:36,559
I'll do it again.

3585
02:32:36,559 --> 02:32:36,879
I can do it.

3586
02:32:36,879 --> 02:32:37,280
I can do it.

3587
02:32:37,280 --> 02:32:37,520
I get it.

3588
02:32:37,520 --> 02:32:38,319
I understand the game.

3589
02:32:38,319 --> 02:32:38,959
Go, go, go, go, go.

3590
02:32:38,959 --> 02:32:39,280
I don't care.

3591
02:32:39,280 --> 02:32:39,520
Okay.

3592
02:32:39,520 --> 02:32:39,760
I get it.

3593
02:32:39,760 --> 02:32:40,319
I get it.

3594
02:32:40,319 --> 02:32:40,879
I understand.

3595
02:32:40,879 --> 02:32:42,079
I understand.

3596
02:32:42,079 --> 02:32:50,959
I don't care.

3597
02:32:50,959 --> 02:32:51,920
Zero skill points.

3598
02:32:51,920 --> 02:32:52,159
What?

3599
02:33:14,729 --> 02:33:17,149
Okay.

3600
02:33:17,149 --> 02:33:17,389
Go.

3601
02:33:17,389 --> 02:33:17,950
I win.

3602
02:33:17,950 --> 02:33:18,190
Good.

3603
02:33:18,190 --> 02:33:18,430
Good.

3604
02:33:18,430 --> 02:33:18,750
I get it.

3605
02:33:18,750 --> 02:33:19,229
I understand.

3606
02:33:25,340 --> 02:33:25,579
Okay.

3607
02:33:27,770 --> 02:33:30,170
I know I bought a dagger on the axe build.

3608
02:33:30,170 --> 02:33:30,729
Not again.

3609
02:33:30,729 --> 02:33:31,530
Not going to happen again.

3610
02:33:32,329 --> 02:33:34,729
Here we go.

3611
02:33:34,729 --> 02:33:36,409
I'm going to buy this cleaver.

3612
02:33:36,409 --> 02:33:37,129
Done.

3613
02:33:37,129 --> 02:33:38,250
Now I'm going to win.

3614
02:33:38,250 --> 02:33:38,729
Watch this.

3615
02:33:46,760 --> 02:34:01,770
Okay.

3616
02:34:35,579 --> 02:34:37,020
What the heck?

3617
02:34:49,370 --> 02:34:49,610
Yes.

3618
02:34:49,610 --> 02:34:49,930
Okay.

3619
02:34:49,930 --> 02:34:50,170
All right.

3620
02:34:50,170 --> 02:34:50,409
We're good.

3621
02:34:50,409 --> 02:34:50,729
We're good.

3622
02:34:50,729 --> 02:34:50,969
We're good.

3623
02:34:50,969 --> 02:34:53,639
We're good.

3624
02:34:53,639 --> 02:34:54,120
Strength.

3625
02:34:57,020 --> 02:34:58,440
Okay.

3626
02:34:58,440 --> 02:35:00,280
Now I'm going to go to the armory.

3627
02:35:01,079 --> 02:35:02,680
I'm going to buy some potions and shit too.

3628
02:35:03,319 --> 02:35:07,440
I need magicka of four.

3629
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:08,799
Oh, shit.

3630
02:35:08,799 --> 02:35:09,200
I can't.

3631
02:35:10,399 --> 02:35:12,270
Get stamina and defense.

3632
02:35:12,270 --> 02:35:12,829
I will soon.

3633
02:35:13,629 --> 02:35:14,430
How much money do I have?

3634
02:35:14,989 --> 02:35:16,000
Okay.

3635
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,399
I need 2800.

3636
02:35:25,049 --> 02:35:25,690
Elmit.

3637
02:35:25,690 --> 02:35:28,200
I can't afford any of this stuff.

3638
02:35:29,079 --> 02:35:29,799
Shoulder guards.

3639
02:35:30,440 --> 02:35:32,000
I can't afford this.

3640
02:35:32,319 --> 02:35:33,280
At least I can afford these.

3641
02:35:33,280 --> 02:35:33,680
That's fine.

3642
02:35:34,239 --> 02:35:36,139
Okay.

3643
02:35:36,780 --> 02:35:37,579
Back to it.

3644
02:35:37,579 --> 02:35:37,899
Duel.

3645
02:35:38,620 --> 02:35:43,760
Buy boots.

3646
02:35:43,760 --> 02:35:44,159
I will.

3647
02:35:54,159 --> 02:35:55,280
One guy.

3648
02:35:55,280 --> 02:35:56,559
One guy's laughing.

3649
02:36:01,389 --> 02:36:02,750
What the fuck, dude?

3650
02:36:02,750 --> 02:36:03,309
I wasn't even...

3651
02:36:08,620 --> 02:36:12,219
One guy in the audience just screwed everything up so bad.

3652
02:36:15,120 --> 02:36:16,399
No, don't.

3653
02:36:16,399 --> 02:36:16,879
What happened?

3654
02:36:16,879 --> 02:36:17,680
I'm on fire.

3655
02:36:17,680 --> 02:36:19,200
This character just sucks.

3656
02:36:19,200 --> 02:36:19,840
I suck.

3657
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:35,319
Hi.

3658
02:36:38,540 --> 02:36:43,180
What?

3659
02:36:43,180 --> 02:36:44,540
Oh, my fucking God.

3660
02:36:44,540 --> 02:36:47,340
The guy has a loincloth on and that's it.

3661
02:36:49,209 --> 02:36:50,569
I have no fucking money.

3662
02:36:50,569 --> 02:36:51,209
I'm over.

3663
02:36:52,010 --> 02:37:00,059
I need stamina.

3664
02:37:00,620 --> 02:37:01,819
God damn it, man.

3665
02:37:02,700 --> 02:37:03,739
It's asleep over here.

3666
02:37:12,649 --> 02:37:17,120
Why does everybody have magic fucking items?

3667
02:37:17,840 --> 02:37:19,360
Why does everybody have magical shit?

3668
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:31,309
I have no money.

3669
02:37:31,309 --> 02:37:32,030
God damn it.

3670
02:37:32,030 --> 02:37:34,989
I thought I was going to be able to do like a basic strength build.

3671
02:37:37,049 --> 02:37:38,090
Charisma was better.

3672
02:37:39,629 --> 02:37:41,229
You did best on the joke character.

3673
02:37:41,950 --> 02:37:42,430
I know.

3674
02:37:42,430 --> 02:37:43,389
Oh, my God.

3675
02:37:43,389 --> 02:37:44,909
That's so frustrating.

3676
02:37:44,909 --> 02:37:45,549
Why?

3677
02:37:45,549 --> 02:37:46,670
Why is it possible?

3678
02:38:15,360 --> 02:38:17,290
Why can't I hit anybody?

3679
02:38:17,290 --> 02:38:18,649
Why can't I hit anybody?

3680
02:39:16,680 --> 02:39:17,079
All right.

3681
02:39:17,079 --> 02:39:18,760
So give me some stamina.

3682
02:39:20,059 --> 02:39:21,340
Give me some defense.

3683
02:39:23,020 --> 02:39:24,059
Give me some attack.

3684
02:39:25,180 --> 02:39:25,899
223.

3685
02:39:27,180 --> 02:39:27,579
Attack.

3686
02:39:28,649 --> 02:39:29,290
Reattack.

3687
02:39:29,850 --> 02:39:36,809
This is good.

3688
02:39:38,670 --> 02:39:38,989
Okay.

3689
02:39:41,959 --> 02:39:42,200
Go.

3690
02:39:50,239 --> 02:39:50,799
Here we go.

3691
02:39:50,799 --> 02:39:51,680
Let's kill this guy.

3692
02:39:54,010 --> 02:39:55,610
Oh, four strength, four stamina.

3693
02:39:57,610 --> 02:40:03,420
Okay.

3694
02:40:03,979 --> 02:40:04,540
So I should do...

3695
02:40:05,579 --> 02:40:06,139
No, no.

3696
02:40:06,139 --> 02:40:06,459
Go back.

3697
02:40:06,459 --> 02:40:07,420
How do I take that back?

3698
02:40:07,420 --> 02:40:08,299
Why is it not a minus?

3699
02:40:10,510 --> 02:40:11,309
This should be a minus.

3700
02:40:11,309 --> 02:40:12,190
Why is it not a minus?

3701
02:40:12,909 --> 02:40:26,889
I'm ready.

3702
02:40:27,530 --> 02:40:30,540
I'm going into this shop and we're going to buy...

3703
02:40:31,659 --> 02:40:35,420
I'm going to get the bigger axe because I'm going to just watch this shit.

3704
02:40:35,420 --> 02:40:36,059
You ready for this?

3705
02:40:36,700 --> 02:40:37,180
Watch this.

3706
02:40:38,139 --> 02:40:39,899
Oh, wait a minute.

3707
02:40:39,899 --> 02:40:41,899
Fair maiden, while leaving the arena,

3708
02:40:41,899 --> 02:40:45,180
you spot a pretty girl smiling at you as she spends some time as you know a lady.

3709
02:40:45,180 --> 02:40:48,139
You pluck up the courage to ask her for a meal.

3710
02:40:48,139 --> 02:40:50,139
Will you be extravagant or just take her out for beers?

3711
02:40:50,780 --> 02:40:52,139
1,500 gold.

3712
02:40:52,860 --> 02:40:57,629
You accept your offer and that night you meet at one of the finest restaurants in town.

3713
02:40:58,190 --> 02:40:58,989
The meal is splendid.

3714
02:40:58,989 --> 02:41:00,350
The conversation flows and soon enough,

3715
02:41:01,149 --> 02:41:03,069
the next morning the maiden gives you a kiss and a rose.

3716
02:41:03,069 --> 02:41:04,110
You shall be her champion.

3717
02:41:04,750 --> 02:41:06,190
You got two stamina points.

3718
02:41:07,260 --> 02:41:08,219
1,500 gold.

3719
02:41:08,219 --> 02:41:09,020
It was not worth it.

3720
02:41:10,350 --> 02:41:14,190
We just got monster subs from Mr. Sark.

3721
02:41:16,030 --> 02:41:17,870
Sark, thanks for the 20 community subs.

3722
02:41:18,670 --> 02:41:21,469
That's the Mr. Sark, streamer on Twitch.

3723
02:41:22,190 --> 02:41:24,350
One of the old school YouTubers.

3724
02:41:26,139 --> 02:41:27,020
Very, very funny guy.

3725
02:41:27,020 --> 02:41:31,180
Follow him right now or I'm going to be extraordinarily upset with you.

3726
02:41:31,180 --> 02:41:38,700
By the way, I've heard that Mr. Sark is the new Drew Crew ambassador from what I heard.

3727
02:41:40,059 --> 02:41:42,670
Hey, Sark, they're yours now.

3728
02:41:44,479 --> 02:41:45,520
They're yours now.

3729
02:41:49,959 --> 02:41:54,639
No, but thanks though.

3730
02:41:54,639 --> 02:41:56,000
Seriously, why does it keep going to medium?

3731
02:41:57,579 --> 02:41:59,739
I haven't gone pee or had water the whole day.

3732
02:42:00,620 --> 02:42:01,659
So let me just do that real quick.

3733
02:42:01,659 --> 02:42:02,219
I'll be right back.

3734
02:42:02,860 --> 02:42:08,479
Let's take a look at some art.

3735
02:47:11,020 --> 02:47:13,850
I just drank so much water.

3736
02:47:13,850 --> 02:47:14,889
That's a lot.

3737
02:47:14,889 --> 02:47:16,350
How's the art looking?

3738
02:47:16,350 --> 02:47:16,909
Looks good.

3739
02:47:18,719 --> 02:47:19,200
That's good.

3740
02:47:19,200 --> 02:47:19,600
Look at that.

3741
02:47:19,600 --> 02:47:20,559
Will you lower it to auto?

3742
02:47:22,799 --> 02:47:26,319
So funny, whenever I talk to the vet,

3743
02:47:27,450 --> 02:47:28,170
I can't help it.

3744
02:47:28,170 --> 02:47:31,690
Every time I say auto's name, I have to say auto.

3745
02:47:31,690 --> 02:47:33,920
So it's like, oh yeah, just call him.

3746
02:47:33,920 --> 02:47:35,280
Yeah, auto has an appointment.

3747
02:47:35,280 --> 02:47:38,399
Yeah, I'm just calling to make an appointment for my dog, auto.

3748
02:47:38,959 --> 02:47:43,770
What's his name?

3749
02:47:43,770 --> 02:47:44,569
Oh, it's auto.

3750
02:47:46,159 --> 02:47:46,399
Sorry.

3751
02:47:46,399 --> 02:47:46,799
Excuse me.

3752
02:47:46,799 --> 02:47:48,559
I mean, auto.

3753
02:47:48,559 --> 02:47:53,770
Sark says sexy art presentation too.

3754
02:47:53,770 --> 02:47:54,569
Sick transitions.

3755
02:47:54,569 --> 02:47:58,379
Yeah, it was made by a couple of people in the community.

3756
02:47:58,379 --> 02:48:01,760
So Yen Wen Len and Lazy Luke.

3757
02:48:03,790 --> 02:48:04,190
It's real.

3758
02:48:04,190 --> 02:48:08,909
Oh, can you imagine?

3759
02:48:08,909 --> 02:48:10,750
Look at that fucking booty.

3760
02:48:11,469 --> 02:48:14,989
I've really leaned into that, I've noticed.

3761
02:48:15,709 --> 02:48:20,909
I've really leaned into that.

3762
02:48:20,909 --> 02:48:21,549
I don't know why.

3763
02:48:21,549 --> 02:48:24,159
I just have whatever.

3764
02:48:24,159 --> 02:48:24,799
Yeah, why?

3765
02:48:24,799 --> 02:48:25,680
I don't know.

3766
02:48:25,680 --> 02:48:26,799
Look, I thought it was fun.

3767
02:48:27,440 --> 02:48:28,159
It's funny.

3768
02:48:28,159 --> 02:48:28,639
It's fun.

3769
02:48:28,639 --> 02:48:29,600
It was fun, okay?

3770
02:48:29,600 --> 02:48:31,120
It's a funny, fun thing.

3771
02:48:31,120 --> 02:48:31,760
I don't care.

3772
02:48:32,399 --> 02:48:37,149
If you do a big zoom in of my ass, it doesn't bother me.

3773
02:48:37,149 --> 02:48:38,479
It just doesn't.

3774
02:48:40,120 --> 02:48:46,360
If you have a zoomed in picture of my ass cheeks, I don't care.

3775
02:48:47,079 --> 02:48:49,319
I'm just like, all right, what are you doing?

3776
02:48:49,319 --> 02:48:52,760
But I don't give a shit.

3777
02:48:52,760 --> 02:48:55,870
I look good for my age.

3778
02:48:55,870 --> 02:48:56,590
I'm 35.

3779
02:48:58,090 --> 02:49:00,649
Look, there's art that says it too.

3780
02:49:02,510 --> 02:49:03,709
No, you don't think I know?

3781
02:49:03,709 --> 02:49:05,309
You don't think I know what I got going on down there?

3782
02:49:13,280 --> 02:49:14,319
Get it off.

3783
02:49:14,319 --> 02:49:14,879
Get it off.

3784
02:49:14,879 --> 02:49:15,440
Never mind.

3785
02:49:15,440 --> 02:49:16,000
Never mind.

3786
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:16,399
Never mind.

3787
02:49:16,399 --> 02:49:16,799
Never mind.

3788
02:49:16,799 --> 02:49:17,200
Never mind.

3789
02:49:23,200 --> 02:49:23,680
I love this though.

3790
02:49:23,680 --> 02:49:24,639
This is fantastic.

3791
02:49:24,639 --> 02:49:27,180
I'm going to cut it off.

3792
02:49:27,180 --> 02:49:29,000
A collection of sub badges.

3793
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:30,200
Oh, shit.

3794
02:49:34,780 --> 02:49:37,739
I have so many empty slots on my Twitch dashboard.

3795
02:49:39,420 --> 02:49:41,659
I really need to do something about this shit.

3796
02:49:44,829 --> 02:49:45,709
Look at that.

3797
02:49:45,709 --> 02:49:47,479
All right, let's go.

3798
02:49:49,760 --> 02:49:50,239
Back to it.

3799
02:49:53,549 --> 02:49:55,149
All right, let's find a bed in the tavern.

3800
02:49:58,399 --> 02:50:00,959
Game Awards start at 3.30 Pacific tomorrow, right?

3801
02:50:00,959 --> 02:50:04,840
I can't wait.

3802
02:50:05,799 --> 02:50:06,280
I'm going to get there.

3803
02:50:06,280 --> 02:50:07,559
I'm going to get my coffee.

3804
02:50:07,559 --> 02:50:08,760
I'm going to have a nice hot coffee.

3805
02:50:10,270 --> 02:50:11,309
Back to the art.

3806
02:50:11,309 --> 02:50:17,690
Okay.

3807
02:50:17,690 --> 02:50:18,719
Here we go.

3808
02:50:18,719 --> 02:50:21,639
What is he holding?

3809
02:50:21,639 --> 02:50:22,040
A disc?

3810
02:50:27,659 --> 02:50:29,239
Can I just smile at him?

3811
02:50:30,799 --> 02:50:33,440
What the fuck am I doing wrong?

3812
02:50:34,319 --> 02:50:43,879
I don't have any armor, but I can afford armor.

3813
02:50:43,879 --> 02:50:47,479
I took a lady out for an expensive quail.

3814
02:50:48,200 --> 02:50:49,239
I don't have any money.

3815
02:51:02,969 --> 02:51:03,290
Boots.

3816
02:51:03,290 --> 02:51:04,010
I have shoes.

3817
02:51:04,010 --> 02:51:04,569
Okay, cool.

3818
02:51:04,569 --> 02:51:06,010
So I have shoes on now.

3819
02:51:06,010 --> 02:51:13,850
I got the boots.

3820
02:51:13,850 --> 02:51:14,889
What about greaves?

3821
02:51:15,530 --> 02:51:18,250
Oh, I can do greaves.

3822
02:51:18,250 --> 02:51:21,559
Just reset.

3823
02:51:21,559 --> 02:51:22,600
No, I can't.

3824
02:51:30,010 --> 02:51:32,170
Please, can you do...

3825
02:51:32,170 --> 02:51:33,129
I don't even know what you're asking.

3826
02:51:33,129 --> 02:51:34,010
I'm not even going to respond.

3827
02:51:40,520 --> 02:51:49,260
Come on.

3828
02:51:49,260 --> 02:51:53,120
11K Andy, 11K Andy, 11K Andy.

3829
02:51:53,120 --> 02:51:54,280
That's pretty good.

3830
02:51:54,280 --> 02:51:55,000
That's really good.

3831
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:55,719
I'm happy with that.

3832
02:51:55,719 --> 02:51:56,440
That's pretty big.

3833
02:52:03,770 --> 02:52:06,329
How about you went from 12K to 11K?

3834
02:52:08,600 --> 02:52:08,840
So?

3835
02:52:09,559 --> 02:52:12,799
But you guys don't understand when I go on break,

3836
02:52:13,600 --> 02:52:15,280
I fucking squeeze both my fists together.

3837
02:52:15,280 --> 02:52:19,200
I go, I went from fucking 12.3K to 11.1K.

3838
02:52:20,319 --> 02:52:22,079
This can't be happening.

3839
02:52:22,079 --> 02:52:23,120
This can't be happening.

3840
02:52:23,120 --> 02:52:24,399
I've got to pull them back.

3841
02:52:24,399 --> 02:52:25,360
I've got to pull them back,

3842
02:52:25,360 --> 02:52:26,479
and I'm going to do it as best I can.

3843
02:52:26,479 --> 02:52:28,159
I'm going to go in there still making cartoon noises.

3844
02:52:28,719 --> 02:52:30,600
And what should I do?

3845
02:52:30,600 --> 02:52:31,559
Vitality?

3846
02:52:31,559 --> 02:52:36,219
Was it Trump?

3847
02:52:37,260 --> 02:52:37,579
What?

3848
02:52:39,360 --> 02:52:39,760
I'm going to...

3849
02:52:40,479 --> 02:52:41,440
It kind of was.

3850
02:52:41,440 --> 02:52:42,159
Shit.

3851
02:52:42,159 --> 02:52:46,090
I'm going to be pulling them back.

3852
02:52:46,090 --> 02:52:46,809
I'm so...

3853
02:52:46,809 --> 02:52:48,489
No, this is just like I'm annoyed.

3854
02:52:49,129 --> 02:52:50,250
Oh, it is kind of Trump.

3855
02:52:50,809 --> 02:52:52,299
This is I'm...

3856
02:52:53,500 --> 02:52:54,700
I do that all...

3857
02:52:54,700 --> 02:52:55,500
Okay, all right, all right.

3858
02:52:55,500 --> 02:52:56,219
Everybody settle down.

3859
02:52:56,219 --> 02:52:57,819
I'm putting one of the strength, one to attack it.

3860
02:52:57,819 --> 02:52:58,379
What did you say?

3861
02:52:59,260 --> 02:53:00,620
One into vitality.

3862
02:53:06,489 --> 02:53:07,950
What's your favorite cartoon noise?

3863
02:53:11,610 --> 02:53:12,090
That or...

3864
02:53:13,770 --> 02:53:35,819
All right, I got to relax.

3865
02:53:35,819 --> 02:53:37,739
I'm just having too much fun today.

3866
02:53:37,739 --> 02:53:39,340
I'm having way too much fun today.

3867
02:53:39,979 --> 02:53:50,809
This guy has so much shit on.

3868
02:54:01,100 --> 02:54:01,899
Come on.

3869
02:54:01,899 --> 02:54:04,620
70% chance.

3870
02:54:04,620 --> 02:54:05,819
How do you not...

3871
02:54:05,819 --> 02:54:08,940
How do you miss 70% chance three times in a row?

3872
02:54:09,500 --> 02:54:10,520
I don't understand.

3873
02:54:11,239 --> 02:54:18,569
It's because duels are only first blood.

3874
02:54:19,899 --> 02:54:20,780
Yeah, but I...

3875
02:54:26,190 --> 02:54:28,670
Okay, all right.

3876
02:54:28,670 --> 02:54:29,389
I got it, I got it, I got it.

3877
02:54:29,389 --> 02:54:30,110
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.

3878
02:54:31,069 --> 02:54:32,030
Some armor on.

3879
02:54:32,030 --> 02:54:32,750
It costs money.

3880
02:54:33,469 --> 02:54:38,719
That costs money.

3881
02:54:38,719 --> 02:54:39,840
Play Binding of Isaac.

3882
02:54:39,840 --> 02:54:41,360
Ooh, when's the expansion coming out?

3883
02:54:53,629 --> 02:54:56,520
Okay, do I finally have enough money to buy anything?

3884
02:54:59,340 --> 02:54:59,899
First blood.

3885
02:54:59,899 --> 02:55:00,860
I got to go for a stab.

3886
02:55:00,860 --> 02:55:02,459
A quick 92% stab in the face.

3887
02:55:03,020 --> 02:55:07,049
Sometime before the end of the year is what's planned.

3888
02:55:07,049 --> 02:55:07,530
Wait, what?

3889
02:55:08,090 --> 02:55:12,700
Can't do that.

3890
02:55:12,700 --> 02:55:14,059
I have to reset again.

3891
02:55:14,059 --> 02:55:17,159
Do I really have to reset again?

3892
02:55:17,159 --> 02:55:18,040
I can't be, right?

3893
02:55:18,600 --> 02:55:24,440
Just get a weapon.

3894
02:55:24,440 --> 02:55:28,590
I can't do it.

3895
02:55:29,149 --> 02:55:29,629
I really don't...

3896
02:55:29,629 --> 02:55:30,510
I don't think I can do it.

3897
02:55:56,909 --> 02:55:58,750
Die, you motherfucker!

3898
02:55:58,750 --> 02:56:02,059
You need way more armor.

3899
02:56:02,059 --> 02:56:04,860
Yeah, I need to not die five times in a row.

3900
02:56:08,590 --> 02:56:08,989
I have to...

3901
02:56:08,989 --> 02:56:09,709
I'd have to get lucky.

3902
02:56:10,430 --> 02:56:16,090
This guy's got a club.

3903
02:56:22,569 --> 02:56:23,450
Yes, okay.

3904
02:56:23,450 --> 02:56:23,850
We're good.

3905
02:56:25,340 --> 02:56:25,899
Okay, hold on.

3906
02:56:25,899 --> 02:56:26,780
We're good, we're good, we're good.

3907
02:56:28,959 --> 02:56:29,920
No, you dick!

3908
02:56:35,790 --> 02:56:36,270
Where did he...

3909
02:56:37,559 --> 02:56:37,959
92.

3910
02:56:38,680 --> 02:56:39,079
Come on.

3911
02:56:39,639 --> 02:56:39,959
Again.

3912
02:56:40,760 --> 02:56:41,079
Again.

3913
02:56:42,729 --> 02:56:43,770
No, don't let him win.

3914
02:56:46,329 --> 02:56:47,129
Yes.

3915
02:56:47,129 --> 02:56:59,450
All right, come on, John the Butcher.

3916
02:56:59,450 --> 02:57:00,010
This is the one.

3917
02:57:01,440 --> 02:57:01,920
Come on.

3918
02:57:02,479 --> 02:57:03,739
This is the one right here.

3919
02:57:07,760 --> 02:57:08,239
Blocked it.

3920
02:57:08,239 --> 02:57:08,799
Okay, get in.

3921
02:57:11,530 --> 02:57:13,819
Okay.

3922
02:57:20,059 --> 02:57:21,420
That hurt a lot.

3923
02:57:24,680 --> 02:57:25,000
Yes!

3924
02:57:27,950 --> 02:57:29,229
Oh, it hurt.

3925
02:57:29,229 --> 02:57:30,430
It hurt, it hurt, it hurt, it hurt.

3926
02:57:31,149 --> 02:57:31,870
I'm gonna lose.

3927
02:57:40,120 --> 02:57:41,079
God damn it!

3928
02:57:41,079 --> 02:57:41,719
I'm in trouble.

3929
02:57:59,850 --> 02:58:00,729
I'm trying to sleep.

3930
02:58:01,690 --> 02:58:02,649
Just stay away from me.

3931
02:58:03,819 --> 02:58:04,620
Get away from me.

3932
02:58:05,260 --> 02:58:05,979
Stay away from me.

3933
02:58:07,840 --> 02:58:09,120
I'm running out of room.

3934
02:58:09,120 --> 02:58:15,340
Oh my, how big is this place?

3935
02:58:15,340 --> 02:58:16,299
I want rest and heal.

3936
02:58:17,260 --> 02:58:17,979
Rest and heal.

3937
02:58:19,020 --> 02:58:21,819
Rest and heal.

3938
02:58:30,840 --> 02:58:40,139
How come I can't heal?

3939
02:58:40,139 --> 02:58:45,770
Rest and heal.

3940
02:58:45,770 --> 02:58:47,049
Keep walking, keep walking.

3941
02:58:55,610 --> 02:58:57,530
Rest and heal.

3942
02:58:57,530 --> 02:58:57,850
There we go.

3943
02:58:57,850 --> 02:58:58,889
All right, all right, right, right.

3944
02:59:07,129 --> 02:59:09,290
What just happened?

3945
02:59:09,290 --> 02:59:10,729
Oh, shit.

3946
02:59:10,729 --> 02:59:11,129
Come on.

3947
02:59:11,129 --> 02:59:12,170
No, no, no, no, no, no.

3948
02:59:14,590 --> 02:59:16,909
This is the most boring fight ever.

3949
02:59:16,909 --> 02:59:18,510
Imagine paying for front row seats here.

3950
02:59:24,280 --> 02:59:26,840
God damn it, I'm dead.

3951
02:59:26,840 --> 02:59:28,840
I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead.

3952
02:59:28,840 --> 02:59:30,280
I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead.

3953
02:59:30,280 --> 02:59:31,399
Run, run, run, run away.

3954
02:59:31,399 --> 02:59:31,959
Run, run, run.

3955
02:59:33,850 --> 02:59:35,340
Oh, shit, can I go behind him?

3956
02:59:35,340 --> 02:59:43,850
Oh, come on, get him.

3957
02:59:43,850 --> 02:59:44,250
Come on.

3958
02:59:45,500 --> 02:59:46,219
Come on, heal.

3959
02:59:49,079 --> 02:59:49,319
No.

3960
02:59:53,719 --> 02:59:54,760
Come on, dude.

3961
02:59:54,760 --> 02:59:55,719
God damn it.

3962
02:59:56,840 --> 02:59:59,719
No, I have to get this right.

3963
02:59:59,719 --> 03:00:03,239
I can't just pay like some lady $1,500 for food.

3964
03:00:04,120 --> 03:00:06,430
I can't just pay somebody $1,500 for food.

3965
03:00:06,430 --> 03:00:08,350
Just win, win.

3966
03:00:08,350 --> 03:00:09,870
For God's sakes, just win.

3967
03:00:10,350 --> 03:00:21,719
Ah, five strength, four strength, four attack, three defense, four defense.

3968
03:00:21,719 --> 03:00:26,670
Okay, four stamina, two, three stamina.

3969
03:00:26,670 --> 03:00:27,549
Okay, all right.

3970
03:00:28,110 --> 03:00:29,069
I don't care what his name is.

3971
03:00:29,069 --> 03:00:29,950
Who cares?

3972
03:00:29,950 --> 03:00:34,780
It's the same person.

3973
03:00:42,510 --> 03:00:51,760
If I do not beat this guy, I'm going to be very mad.

3974
03:00:52,399 --> 03:01:01,600
Here we go.

3975
03:01:01,600 --> 03:01:05,469
Are you ready?

3976
03:01:05,469 --> 03:01:07,549
I'm going to stab this guy once and win.

3977
03:01:07,549 --> 03:01:08,510
And then go buy the axe.

3978
03:01:14,959 --> 03:01:16,889
Oh, my fucking God.

3979
03:01:17,930 --> 03:01:20,090
What the fuck is going on?

3980
03:02:10,120 --> 03:02:10,680
Okay.

3981
03:02:10,680 --> 03:02:11,719
All right, all right, all right.

3982
03:02:11,719 --> 03:02:12,440
I'm good.

3983
03:02:12,440 --> 03:02:16,559
What should I put it in?

3984
03:02:17,200 --> 03:02:25,389
Attack and strength, defense and vitality.

3985
03:02:25,389 --> 03:02:35,600
How much money do I have?

3986
03:02:36,159 --> 03:02:39,950
I need, okay, I need to win a few more.

3987
03:02:39,950 --> 03:02:41,309
I'm going to get the crowd riled up.

3988
03:02:50,989 --> 03:02:54,409
How are they still bored?

3989
03:02:54,409 --> 03:03:03,319
All right, all right, all right, all right.

3990
03:03:20,649 --> 03:03:21,850
Back up, back up.

3991
03:03:21,850 --> 03:03:28,479
Get me in there, get me in there.

3992
03:03:28,479 --> 03:03:29,120
Okay.

3993
03:03:29,120 --> 03:03:31,360
Oh, fuck you.

3994
03:03:31,360 --> 03:03:32,159
Thank God.

3995
03:03:32,159 --> 03:03:42,520
Vitality and strength.

3996
03:03:51,709 --> 03:03:52,350
Weaponsmith.

3997
03:03:52,350 --> 03:03:52,909
Come on.

3998
03:03:52,909 --> 03:03:53,870
Let's go.

3999
03:03:53,870 --> 03:03:54,590
2,200.

4000
03:03:56,319 --> 03:03:59,309
I have enough of the axe.

4001
03:03:59,309 --> 03:04:00,190
Let's get the axe.

4002
03:04:02,329 --> 03:04:03,209
Thank God.

4003
03:04:03,209 --> 03:04:05,370
I have a goddamn weapon now.

4004
03:04:05,370 --> 03:04:08,540
And it's time for the tournament.

4005
03:04:08,540 --> 03:04:09,100
It's time.

4006
03:04:09,659 --> 03:04:11,180
I'm going to win.

4007
03:04:11,180 --> 03:04:11,659
Let's go.

4008
03:04:11,659 --> 03:04:13,579
If I lose right now, then I'm going to be doing something else

4009
03:04:13,579 --> 03:04:15,819
because obviously I'm not, I cut out for this apparently.

4010
03:04:15,819 --> 03:04:17,579
I'm not cut out for this game if I can't do it.

4011
03:04:28,920 --> 03:04:29,639
It was risky.

4012
03:04:44,219 --> 03:04:44,780
Okay.

4013
03:04:44,780 --> 03:04:48,270
Otis?

4014
03:04:48,829 --> 03:04:50,159
Bootis?

4015
03:04:50,159 --> 03:04:55,260
Okay, here we go.

4016
03:04:59,549 --> 03:05:00,030
Nice fall.

4017
03:05:00,030 --> 03:05:00,670
That's comedy.

4018
03:05:01,389 --> 03:05:02,110
That's pretty funny.

4019
03:05:04,700 --> 03:05:05,819
Good guy in the audience.

4020
03:05:12,750 --> 03:05:13,979
Come on.

4021
03:05:13,979 --> 03:05:16,090
92%.

4022
03:05:16,090 --> 03:05:18,799
We're going with normal.

4023
03:05:18,799 --> 03:05:19,040
Again.

4024
03:05:27,149 --> 03:05:28,219
Aye.

4025
03:05:28,860 --> 03:05:29,180
All right.

4026
03:05:29,180 --> 03:05:30,940
Here comes, here comes the butcher.

4027
03:05:30,940 --> 03:05:35,469
This is it.

4028
03:05:35,469 --> 03:05:36,430
I have to win this.

4029
03:05:36,989 --> 03:05:40,350
Doesn't, his armor sucks.

4030
03:05:40,350 --> 03:05:42,030
Why is, how is it, how does he have that much armor?

4031
03:05:53,079 --> 03:05:53,559
Let's go.

4032
03:05:54,440 --> 03:05:55,239
Let's go.

4033
03:05:55,239 --> 03:05:57,159
Wow, he put himself in such a bad spot.

4034
03:05:57,159 --> 03:05:58,670
And he slept too.

4035
03:05:58,670 --> 03:06:00,030
Perfect opportunity to get to him.

4036
03:06:00,590 --> 03:06:00,989
Nice.

4037
03:06:00,989 --> 03:06:01,389
All right.

4038
03:06:01,389 --> 03:06:01,790
Let's go.

4039
03:06:01,790 --> 03:06:03,440
Forward, move forward.

4040
03:06:03,440 --> 03:06:04,159
Lunch.

4041
03:06:04,159 --> 03:06:06,079
What are we at?

4042
03:06:06,079 --> 03:06:07,200
70, only go for the 70%.

4043
03:06:09,479 --> 03:06:11,469
Move forward, we're not going to do anything stupid.

4044
03:06:11,469 --> 03:06:13,069
Again, move forward, not going to do anything dumb.

4045
03:06:13,069 --> 03:06:14,989
Move forward again, not going to do anything stupid.

4046
03:06:14,989 --> 03:06:17,360
He just crit me for fucking 50 damage.

4047
03:06:17,360 --> 03:06:18,559
You piece of shit.

4048
03:06:18,559 --> 03:06:19,360
Are you kidding me?

4049
03:06:21,129 --> 03:06:21,450
Really?

4050
03:06:21,450 --> 03:07:10,040
Fuck, I just cut off my attack.

4051
03:07:10,040 --> 03:07:13,319
The guy, if I get close, I'm going to die.

4052
03:07:13,319 --> 03:07:32,959
I don't even know what the character looks like.

4053
03:07:32,959 --> 03:07:36,680
I don't even know what he had points in.

4054
03:07:47,639 --> 03:07:50,459
Just go full charisma.

4055
03:07:51,340 --> 03:07:58,000
I'm never going to beat the butcher.

4056
03:07:58,000 --> 03:08:08,159
Fine.

4057
03:08:08,159 --> 03:08:08,799
Fuck it.

4058
03:08:20,430 --> 03:08:22,350
How about just a bashing stick?

4059
03:08:22,909 --> 03:08:26,540
Christmas OP, just yell and taunt.

4060
03:08:26,540 --> 03:08:31,930
No, get armor first.

4061
03:08:31,930 --> 03:08:32,170
Okay.

4062
03:08:32,809 --> 03:08:36,139
So should I just get a big chest plate?

4063
03:08:36,879 --> 03:08:38,879
What's the best thing to buy first?

4064
03:08:39,520 --> 03:08:40,159
Please help me.

4065
03:08:40,159 --> 03:08:41,360
I can't beat the butcher.

4066
03:08:41,920 --> 03:08:49,930
Just get all the cheapest shit.

4067
03:08:49,930 --> 03:08:52,479
So just get all the cheap crap?

4068
03:08:52,479 --> 03:09:07,709
Like the 48, these peasant boots?

4069
03:09:07,709 --> 03:09:08,909
Single comma name.

4070
03:09:08,909 --> 03:09:09,149
What?

4071
03:09:10,479 --> 03:09:10,719
No.

4072
03:09:11,979 --> 03:09:12,219
All right.

4073
03:09:12,219 --> 03:09:12,700
I'm just going to...

4074
03:09:12,700 --> 03:09:12,940
Okay.

4075
03:09:13,579 --> 03:09:14,559
I'm going to buy these.

4076
03:09:15,360 --> 03:09:17,639
I'm going to buy how much of these?

4077
03:09:18,280 --> 03:09:19,260
400, hold on.

4078
03:09:19,979 --> 03:09:22,680
Gauntlets are 300.

4079
03:09:25,309 --> 03:09:26,350
Helmet is cheap.

4080
03:09:26,350 --> 03:09:26,989
No, it's not.

4081
03:09:27,879 --> 03:09:29,000
Shoulder guards are cheap.

4082
03:09:29,000 --> 03:09:29,559
No, they're not.

4083
03:09:30,280 --> 03:09:31,639
Gauntlets are cheap.

4084
03:09:31,639 --> 03:09:32,120
Yes, they are.

4085
03:09:32,840 --> 03:09:33,959
We'll get the middle of the road ones.

4086
03:09:34,520 --> 03:09:37,040
What about a shield?

4087
03:09:37,040 --> 03:09:38,000
Can I get a cheap shield?

4088
03:09:38,000 --> 03:09:38,239
No.

4089
03:09:39,340 --> 03:09:39,819
Greaves.

4090
03:09:39,819 --> 03:09:40,059
Okay.

4091
03:09:40,860 --> 03:09:41,260
These are...

4092
03:09:41,260 --> 03:09:41,899
Okay.

4093
03:09:41,899 --> 03:09:42,620
Get the greaves.

4094
03:09:43,420 --> 03:09:46,799
Shoulder guards.

4095
03:09:46,799 --> 03:09:48,079
I'm just going to get the...

4096
03:09:48,719 --> 03:09:49,920
I'll get the cheap shoulder guards.

4097
03:09:50,479 --> 03:09:54,219
Or should I get shin guards instead?

4098
03:09:54,940 --> 03:09:56,219
Do the shoulder guards.

4099
03:09:56,219 --> 03:09:57,979
Okay.

4100
03:09:58,940 --> 03:10:00,379
I bought all the armor I could buy.

4101
03:10:01,180 --> 03:10:05,260
So now I'm going to go and I'm going to start screaming at people for the duels.

4102
03:10:05,260 --> 03:10:06,860
And I'm going to taunt and I'm going to make a bunch of money.

4103
03:10:28,250 --> 03:10:29,450
Get me over there now.

4104
03:10:50,940 --> 03:10:52,750
How can you block a scream?

4105
03:11:03,610 --> 03:11:04,409
God damn it.

4106
03:11:18,000 --> 03:11:20,000
Get that first hit on him.

4107
03:11:20,000 --> 03:11:48,190
Let's work the crowd and make some money.

4108
03:11:56,670 --> 03:11:57,389
What is this guy's weapon?

4109
03:11:57,389 --> 03:11:58,750
He's got a golden sword.

4110
03:11:58,750 --> 03:12:11,659
Why is this working?

4111
03:12:22,969 --> 03:12:23,690
Stop.

4112
03:12:23,690 --> 03:12:24,250
Come on.

4113
03:12:28,889 --> 03:12:32,750
You piece of shit.

4114
03:12:32,750 --> 03:12:32,989
All right.

4115
03:12:32,989 --> 03:12:33,469
I'm good.

4116
03:12:33,469 --> 03:12:36,270
Okay.

4117
03:12:36,270 --> 03:12:37,149
Doing all right.

4118
03:12:37,149 --> 03:12:39,469
I don't want to mess this up now.

4119
03:12:39,469 --> 03:12:40,190
Seriously.

4120
03:12:40,190 --> 03:12:42,250
What should I really put this into?

4121
03:12:42,889 --> 03:12:52,059
Charisma and vitality.

4122
03:12:53,879 --> 03:12:54,360
Charisma.

4123
03:12:54,360 --> 03:12:54,920
Seriously.

4124
03:12:54,920 --> 03:12:55,319
Seriously.

4125
03:12:55,319 --> 03:12:55,719
Charisma.

4126
03:12:55,719 --> 03:12:56,200
Stamina.

4127
03:12:56,760 --> 03:12:58,459
I'm going to do...

4128
03:12:58,459 --> 03:12:59,180
All right.

4129
03:12:59,180 --> 03:13:03,549
What do I got for money?

4130
03:13:06,879 --> 03:13:07,920
2400.

4131
03:13:07,920 --> 03:13:08,319
Okay.

4132
03:13:08,319 --> 03:13:08,879
I'm going to save it.

4133
03:13:08,879 --> 03:13:10,000
I'm going to keep screaming at people.

4134
03:13:12,569 --> 03:13:12,809
No.

4135
03:13:12,809 --> 03:13:12,969
Okay.

4136
03:13:12,969 --> 03:13:14,409
I had to buy something.

4137
03:13:14,409 --> 03:13:15,920
What do I do?

4138
03:13:15,920 --> 03:13:21,069
I feel like I should just get this.

4139
03:13:26,670 --> 03:13:27,389
Enchant the club.

4140
03:13:28,030 --> 03:13:30,479
Or better armor.

4141
03:13:30,479 --> 03:13:31,959
The waist?

4142
03:13:34,889 --> 03:13:35,290
Armor.

4143
03:13:35,290 --> 03:13:35,690
Armor.

4144
03:13:35,690 --> 03:13:36,010
Armor.

4145
03:13:36,010 --> 03:13:36,329
Armor.

4146
03:13:36,329 --> 03:13:36,649
Armor.

4147
03:13:36,649 --> 03:13:36,969
Armor.

4148
03:13:36,969 --> 03:13:37,209
Okay.

4149
03:13:38,729 --> 03:13:39,530
A shield?

4150
03:13:39,530 --> 03:13:42,120
I could get a shield.

4151
03:13:42,120 --> 03:13:46,280
Okay.

4152
03:13:46,280 --> 03:13:50,409
What else can I get?

4153
03:13:50,409 --> 03:13:52,079
Shin guards?

4154
03:13:52,079 --> 03:13:53,120
All right.

4155
03:13:53,120 --> 03:13:53,440
Okay.

4156
03:13:53,440 --> 03:13:54,319
I can get shin guards.

4157
03:13:56,649 --> 03:13:56,889
Okay.

4158
03:13:58,520 --> 03:13:59,159
All right.

4159
03:13:59,159 --> 03:14:02,190
I think I'm ready.

4160
03:14:02,190 --> 03:14:04,670
I already have these, right?

4161
03:14:08,680 --> 03:14:09,079
Potions?

4162
03:14:09,079 --> 03:14:09,959
I can't buy potions.

4163
03:14:09,959 --> 03:14:10,840
I don't have enough magic.

4164
03:14:11,479 --> 03:14:19,319
Okay.

4165
03:14:19,319 --> 03:14:21,000
You need four magicka to buy potion.

4166
03:14:21,799 --> 03:14:22,750
Go enchant.

4167
03:14:23,389 --> 03:14:25,100
Okay.

4168
03:14:25,100 --> 03:14:25,500
Enchant.

4169
03:14:27,100 --> 03:14:28,540
So I'm going to enchant with...

4170
03:14:29,340 --> 03:14:32,440
I'm going to enchant my rusty knife.

4171
03:14:33,600 --> 03:14:34,799
With fire.

4172
03:14:34,799 --> 03:14:40,969
Or ice?

4173
03:14:40,969 --> 03:14:44,120
Yeah.

4174
03:14:44,120 --> 03:14:44,760
We're going to fire.

4175
03:14:45,399 --> 03:14:48,860
That's one flame, one frost, one poison.

4176
03:14:48,860 --> 03:14:49,020
Yeah.

4177
03:14:49,020 --> 03:14:49,739
We're just going to fire.

4178
03:14:49,739 --> 03:14:50,059
Whatever.

4179
03:14:51,899 --> 03:14:52,940
Potency.

4180
03:14:52,940 --> 03:14:55,579
Add three fire damage.

4181
03:14:55,579 --> 03:14:55,819
That's...

4182
03:14:56,780 --> 03:14:57,260
For free?

4183
03:14:57,819 --> 03:14:58,219
All right.

4184
03:14:58,219 --> 03:14:58,940
That's pretty sick.

4185
03:14:59,739 --> 03:15:00,809
All right.

4186
03:15:00,809 --> 03:15:01,129
Let's go.

4187
03:15:01,850 --> 03:15:03,309
I'm ready.

4188
03:15:03,309 --> 03:15:05,770
I'm going to beat John the Butcher right now.

4189
03:15:06,489 --> 03:15:08,840
I'm so sick of this.

4190
03:15:08,840 --> 03:15:09,000
Okay.

4191
03:15:09,000 --> 03:15:10,040
I've got 107 armor.

4192
03:15:10,040 --> 03:15:10,360
Let's go.

4193
03:15:11,399 --> 03:15:23,420
Burnt him with my sound?

4194
03:15:25,979 --> 03:15:39,690
Am I finally going to beat the butcher?

4195
03:15:40,920 --> 03:15:41,399
Please.

4196
03:15:41,399 --> 03:15:42,760
Am I finally going to beat the butcher?

4197
03:15:43,719 --> 03:15:47,069
With my yell build?

4198
03:15:51,979 --> 03:15:58,879
I told you to do this build.

4199
03:15:59,840 --> 03:16:00,000
Yeah.

4200
03:16:00,000 --> 03:16:00,399
But I don't know.

4201
03:16:00,399 --> 03:16:02,239
I was under the impression that this was just a joke

4202
03:16:02,239 --> 03:16:03,760
that we were doing in the beginning of the game.

4203
03:16:03,760 --> 03:16:05,120
I didn't know it was actually viable.

4204
03:16:05,920 --> 03:16:14,479
I want the money.

4205
03:16:14,479 --> 03:16:17,739
He's got a long way to go before he gets over here.

4206
03:16:26,350 --> 03:16:26,670
No.

4207
03:16:26,670 --> 03:16:27,229
He's coming.

4208
03:16:27,229 --> 03:16:31,610
Hold on.

4209
03:16:31,610 --> 03:16:32,809
Oh, that hurt.

4210
03:16:32,809 --> 03:16:36,040
Good.

4211
03:16:36,040 --> 03:16:36,520
Good, good.

4212
03:16:36,520 --> 03:16:36,840
All right.

4213
03:16:36,840 --> 03:16:37,319
No.

4214
03:16:37,319 --> 03:16:37,639
Back up.

4215
03:16:37,639 --> 03:16:38,040
Back up.

4216
03:16:38,040 --> 03:16:38,520
Back him up.

4217
03:16:41,549 --> 03:16:44,319
Come on.

4218
03:16:49,040 --> 03:16:49,520
There it is.

4219
03:16:53,549 --> 03:16:56,250
Again.

4220
03:16:56,250 --> 03:16:56,569
Again.

4221
03:16:58,059 --> 03:16:58,299
Again.

4222
03:16:59,579 --> 03:16:59,899
Again.

4223
03:17:01,180 --> 03:17:01,899
Again.

4224
03:17:01,899 --> 03:17:02,379
Again.

4225
03:17:02,379 --> 03:17:02,780
Again.

4226
03:17:02,780 --> 03:17:03,180
Again.

4227
03:17:03,180 --> 03:17:03,579
Again.

4228
03:17:03,579 --> 03:17:03,899
Again.

4229
03:17:03,899 --> 03:17:04,299
Again.

4230
03:17:04,299 --> 03:17:04,620
Again.

4231
03:17:04,620 --> 03:17:04,860
All right.

4232
03:17:12,159 --> 03:17:13,120
15 charisma.

4233
03:17:14,329 --> 03:17:15,129
For John the butcher,

4234
03:17:15,129 --> 03:17:17,049
I think I'm going to have to do some more defense.

4235
03:17:17,049 --> 03:17:20,409
What vitality?

4236
03:17:20,409 --> 03:17:23,340
Which one?

4237
03:17:23,340 --> 03:17:24,139
Vitality probably?

4238
03:17:24,139 --> 03:17:24,299
Yeah.

4239
03:17:25,840 --> 03:17:26,079
All right.

4240
03:17:26,079 --> 03:17:26,559
Bring him on.

4241
03:17:26,559 --> 03:17:26,959
Let's go.

4242
03:17:26,959 --> 03:17:28,079
I'm done with this bullshit.

4243
03:17:28,959 --> 03:17:33,600
There it is.

4244
03:17:33,600 --> 03:17:33,920
All right.

4245
03:17:33,920 --> 03:17:34,399
38.

4246
03:17:37,280 --> 03:17:37,920
38 again.

4247
03:17:37,920 --> 03:17:38,879
This is the win.

4248
03:17:38,879 --> 03:17:39,760
This is the win right now.

4249
03:17:48,700 --> 03:17:49,420
Get away from me.

4250
03:17:50,940 --> 03:18:09,819
Eventually, it's going to work.

4251
03:18:09,819 --> 03:18:10,780
It's a matter of time.

4252
03:18:11,500 --> 03:18:13,520
Oh, you know what?

4253
03:18:13,520 --> 03:18:15,040
Let's get a little step.

4254
03:18:15,040 --> 03:18:16,239
No, let's not get a little.

4255
03:18:19,069 --> 03:18:19,629
Move him away.

4256
03:18:21,690 --> 03:18:22,329
Nice.

4257
03:18:22,329 --> 03:18:22,889
Come on.

4258
03:18:22,889 --> 03:18:23,209
Please.

4259
03:18:23,209 --> 03:18:24,649
Let me beat John the butcher.

4260
03:18:28,059 --> 03:18:28,379
Yes.

4261
03:18:29,850 --> 03:18:30,250
Yes.

4262
03:18:31,049 --> 03:18:31,770
Finally.

4263
03:18:31,770 --> 03:18:32,889
He's dead.

4264
03:18:32,889 --> 03:18:34,090
It took like an hour.

4265
03:18:35,049 --> 03:18:39,129
12,500 gold pieces.

4266
03:18:40,190 --> 03:18:40,909
What?

4267
03:18:40,909 --> 03:18:41,149
What?

4268
03:18:41,870 --> 03:18:51,680
Oh, my God.

4269
03:18:51,680 --> 03:18:52,079
Okay.

4270
03:18:52,079 --> 03:18:54,000
Well, now I need to figure out what the hell I'm going to do.

4271
03:18:58,719 --> 03:18:59,280
Breastplate.

4272
03:19:00,879 --> 03:19:01,920
I have to get this one, right?

4273
03:19:04,940 --> 03:19:05,739
64 armor.

4274
03:19:05,739 --> 03:19:07,739
So I just dump all my money into this breastplate.

4275
03:19:08,299 --> 03:19:14,809
3% damage taken converted to energy.

4276
03:19:15,450 --> 03:19:29,819
What about a shield?

4277
03:19:29,819 --> 03:19:30,459
Definitely this one.

4278
03:19:30,459 --> 03:19:31,020
Look at this thing.

4279
03:19:31,659 --> 03:19:37,420
Okay.

4280
03:19:37,420 --> 03:19:37,659
Nice.

4281
03:19:38,639 --> 03:19:38,959
Nice.

4282
03:19:38,959 --> 03:19:39,200
Nice.

4283
03:19:39,200 --> 03:19:39,440
Nice.

4284
03:19:39,440 --> 03:19:39,600
All right.

4285
03:19:39,600 --> 03:19:40,159
What about this one?

4286
03:19:44,190 --> 03:19:44,909
Now enchant.

4287
03:19:45,549 --> 03:19:50,329
Enchant weapon.

4288
03:19:50,329 --> 03:19:53,159
Enchant.

4289
03:19:53,159 --> 03:19:53,879
More potency.

4290
03:19:54,520 --> 03:19:56,299
Do fire again?

4291
03:19:58,719 --> 03:19:59,440
Buy a weapon.

4292
03:20:00,159 --> 03:20:01,739
Oh, I don't have enough money for a weapon.

4293
03:20:10,250 --> 03:20:11,049
Save at the church.

4294
03:20:11,049 --> 03:20:12,809
I need to make an account to save and I'm not doing it.

4295
03:20:13,690 --> 03:20:14,489
All right.

4296
03:20:14,489 --> 03:20:15,049
Let's try this.

4297
03:20:16,559 --> 03:20:17,280
Level five.

4298
03:20:17,280 --> 03:20:18,079
Level five.

4299
03:20:18,079 --> 03:20:18,639
All right.

4300
03:20:18,639 --> 03:20:20,000
Look at all this armor, though.

4301
03:20:20,000 --> 03:20:20,959
This guy doesn't have any armor.

4302
03:20:22,000 --> 03:20:23,280
I just instantly killed that guy.

4303
03:20:23,840 --> 03:20:26,010
I just made money.

4304
03:20:26,649 --> 03:20:32,239
This guy doesn't have any armor either.

4305
03:20:32,239 --> 03:20:32,399
All right.

4306
03:20:32,399 --> 03:20:33,200
We're going to work with the crowd.

4307
03:20:33,200 --> 03:20:34,559
I want to work with the crowd a little bit.

4308
03:20:35,360 --> 03:20:35,760
I'm just...

4309
03:20:35,760 --> 03:20:36,000
Wait.

4310
03:20:36,000 --> 03:20:37,040
Did I just burn him with...

4311
03:20:37,040 --> 03:20:38,639
I just farted on him and I burnt him?

4312
03:20:39,200 --> 03:20:40,000
What the hell was that?

4313
03:20:53,280 --> 03:20:54,799
It was a charisma fart.

4314
03:20:57,610 --> 03:20:58,649
Don't let him get the first hit.

4315
03:20:58,649 --> 03:20:58,809
All right.

4316
03:20:58,809 --> 03:20:59,530
Crowd's entertained.

4317
03:20:59,530 --> 03:20:59,930
Hold on.

4318
03:21:05,879 --> 03:21:06,440
Interested.

4319
03:21:08,440 --> 03:21:09,159
Entertained.

4320
03:21:10,840 --> 03:21:12,040
Enthusiastic.

4321
03:21:12,040 --> 03:21:12,280
Okay.

4322
03:21:12,280 --> 03:21:12,680
I don't care.

4323
03:21:12,680 --> 03:21:13,319
I'm still dancing.

4324
03:21:13,319 --> 03:21:14,040
Let's fill that bar.

4325
03:21:14,600 --> 03:21:15,559
Wildly entertained.

4326
03:21:15,559 --> 03:21:15,799
More.

4327
03:21:18,600 --> 03:21:19,559
Wildly entertained.

4328
03:21:22,680 --> 03:21:23,399
Transfixed.

4329
03:21:26,219 --> 03:21:26,860
Fanatical.

4330
03:21:30,510 --> 03:21:30,750
And...

4331
03:21:31,309 --> 03:21:37,049
Come on.

4332
03:21:37,049 --> 03:21:37,450
Get him.

4333
03:21:41,790 --> 03:21:42,670
Get him.

4334
03:21:42,670 --> 03:21:43,790
All right.

4335
03:21:44,590 --> 03:21:45,469
Get him out of transfixed.

4336
03:21:47,000 --> 03:21:47,559
Fanatical.

4337
03:21:48,280 --> 03:21:49,920
How much money do you get for doing this?

4338
03:21:55,959 --> 03:21:56,280
Back up.

4339
03:21:56,280 --> 03:21:56,600
Back up.

4340
03:21:56,600 --> 03:21:57,000
Back up.

4341
03:21:57,000 --> 03:21:57,239
Back up.

4342
03:21:57,239 --> 03:21:57,559
Back up.

4343
03:21:57,559 --> 03:21:57,719
All right.

4344
03:21:57,719 --> 03:21:58,040
Here we go.

4345
03:22:00,219 --> 03:22:01,180
Just kill him.

4346
03:22:01,180 --> 03:22:02,059
Just punch him in the face.

4347
03:22:06,329 --> 03:22:08,010
3,200...

4348
03:22:08,010 --> 03:22:09,770
3,300 gold for that.

4349
03:22:11,899 --> 03:22:13,739
Holy shit.

4350
03:22:13,739 --> 03:22:22,860
What do I do?

4351
03:22:24,219 --> 03:22:25,260
Not all charisma.

4352
03:22:25,260 --> 03:22:26,059
I can't be a dope.

4353
03:22:29,180 --> 03:22:29,899
I mean, maybe one.

4354
03:22:29,899 --> 03:22:30,299
One more.

4355
03:22:31,850 --> 03:22:32,569
New weapon.

4356
03:22:32,569 --> 03:22:33,049
What do we need?

4357
03:22:33,049 --> 03:22:33,610
What do we want?

4358
03:22:35,739 --> 03:22:36,139
Bow?

4359
03:22:36,139 --> 03:22:36,379
No.

4360
03:22:37,020 --> 03:22:39,319
What about this?

4361
03:22:39,319 --> 03:22:40,440
I got 6,000 gold.

4362
03:22:41,159 --> 03:22:51,950
I kind of need to do that.

4363
03:22:51,950 --> 03:22:52,750
I have to buy this.

4364
03:22:53,469 --> 03:22:55,370
Don't buy a weapon, you dummy.

4365
03:22:59,000 --> 03:22:59,639
More armor.

4366
03:23:01,680 --> 03:23:02,000
Okay.

4367
03:23:04,889 --> 03:23:07,709
Let's replace the chin guards.

4368
03:23:08,799 --> 03:23:09,120
Ooh.

4369
03:23:10,079 --> 03:23:10,719
Look at these ones.

4370
03:23:11,739 --> 03:23:11,979
Yeah.

4371
03:23:13,290 --> 03:23:13,610
Nice.

4372
03:23:13,610 --> 03:23:13,930
Okay.

4373
03:23:14,569 --> 03:23:15,209
New greaves.

4374
03:23:15,770 --> 03:23:17,370
Oh, look at these.

4375
03:23:17,370 --> 03:23:18,170
Veteran greaves.

4376
03:23:18,889 --> 03:23:19,290
Nice.

4377
03:23:19,290 --> 03:23:19,690
Okay.

4378
03:23:19,690 --> 03:23:20,889
What about new boots?

4379
03:23:23,069 --> 03:23:24,190
Oh, veteran boots.

4380
03:23:30,010 --> 03:23:30,489
Greaves.

4381
03:23:31,049 --> 03:23:32,680
Okay.

4382
03:23:32,680 --> 03:23:33,000
All right.

4383
03:23:33,000 --> 03:23:34,200
I'm gonna say about...

4384
03:23:34,200 --> 03:23:40,110
Level 9.

4385
03:23:46,430 --> 03:23:48,110
229 armor.

4386
03:23:54,569 --> 03:23:54,969
Easy.

4387
03:23:56,780 --> 03:23:57,659
Easy with this.

4388
03:24:07,790 --> 03:24:08,270
Block that.

4389
03:24:08,989 --> 03:24:11,920
3,700 gold, dude.

4390
03:24:12,799 --> 03:24:14,040
Looking pretty good.

4391
03:24:14,760 --> 03:24:20,000
Just level 3.

4392
03:24:20,639 --> 03:24:24,000
Why is a level 3 fighting a level 6?

4393
03:24:24,639 --> 03:24:33,799
Save up for the better helmet?

4394
03:24:36,639 --> 03:24:38,079
You're never gonna break my armor, dude.

4395
03:24:38,079 --> 03:24:41,200
I'm gonna sit here all day until I get the most amount of money possible.

4396
03:24:47,739 --> 03:24:48,459
Nice weapon.

4397
03:24:54,399 --> 03:25:07,790
I had 200...

4398
03:25:07,790 --> 03:25:09,469
I had 200 armor.

4399
03:25:10,030 --> 03:25:12,299
How did that happen?

4400
03:25:12,299 --> 03:25:17,870
A crit goes through armor?

4401
03:25:19,309 --> 03:25:20,350
Oh, you shitting me.

4402
03:25:21,069 --> 03:25:31,840
Don't...

4403
03:25:31,840 --> 03:25:32,239
Okay.

4404
03:25:32,239 --> 03:25:32,799
Just kill him.

4405
03:25:33,680 --> 03:25:39,579
Can even shoot...

4406
03:25:39,579 --> 03:25:40,059
Okay.

4407
03:25:40,059 --> 03:25:40,540
He's dead.

4408
03:25:41,340 --> 03:25:44,909
I just beat John the Butcher, chat.

4409
03:25:45,790 --> 03:25:46,350
Did you?

4410
03:25:46,350 --> 03:25:46,670
Nice.

4411
03:25:47,629 --> 03:25:48,270
He's tough.

4412
03:25:48,270 --> 03:25:48,670
Hey.

4413
03:25:48,670 --> 03:25:49,309
Hey.

4414
03:25:49,309 --> 03:25:50,350
He's pretty tough.

4415
03:25:50,350 --> 03:25:50,909
Nice work.

4416
03:25:53,370 --> 03:25:54,649
Swift sandals, was that?

4417
03:25:55,450 --> 03:26:07,819
Don't crit me.

4418
03:26:13,309 --> 03:26:28,190
That counts, right?

4419
03:26:28,190 --> 03:26:28,989
Chauvin taunt.

4420
03:26:28,989 --> 03:26:30,110
Don't ever use your weapon.

4421
03:26:31,069 --> 03:26:39,959
So just never upgrade the weapon?

4422
03:26:39,959 --> 03:26:40,360
Never.

4423
03:26:40,360 --> 03:26:45,309
What the hell?

4424
03:26:45,309 --> 03:26:46,510
I don't want to just do only...

4425
03:26:47,149 --> 03:26:48,350
All right, I'm going to bed.

4426
03:26:48,350 --> 03:26:48,989
Okay, I'm going to bed.

4427
03:26:55,370 --> 03:26:56,329
6900.

4428
03:26:56,329 --> 03:26:57,290
I'm gonna save it.

4429
03:26:57,290 --> 03:26:58,090
I'm gonna save the money.

4430
03:26:58,729 --> 03:26:59,280
All right.

4431
03:26:59,280 --> 03:26:59,600
No, no, no.

4432
03:26:59,600 --> 03:26:59,840
I'm not.

4433
03:26:59,840 --> 03:27:00,479
No, I'm not.

4434
03:27:00,479 --> 03:27:00,719
Okay.

4435
03:27:01,360 --> 03:27:06,010
What can I replace that's expensive?

4436
03:27:09,319 --> 03:27:09,959
Gauntlets?

4437
03:27:09,959 --> 03:27:10,200
Yeah.

4438
03:27:10,200 --> 03:27:10,440
Okay.

4439
03:27:10,440 --> 03:27:10,920
What are these?

4440
03:27:11,799 --> 03:27:12,200
Yeah.

4441
03:27:12,200 --> 03:27:12,760
Get these things.

4442
03:27:13,819 --> 03:27:14,139
Nice.

4443
03:27:14,139 --> 03:27:14,379
All right.

4444
03:27:14,379 --> 03:27:14,940
What about the...

4445
03:27:18,719 --> 03:27:23,680
60 armor, 50 armor, 40 armor, 30 armor.

4446
03:27:23,760 --> 03:27:24,239
Okay.

4447
03:27:26,239 --> 03:27:27,120
Helmet, you fool.

4448
03:27:27,120 --> 03:27:28,079
All right, I got it.

4449
03:27:28,079 --> 03:27:28,639
All right, let's go.

4450
03:27:28,639 --> 03:27:30,239
Let's kick this guy's ass.

4451
03:27:30,239 --> 03:27:33,239
What's the next tournament?

4452
03:27:33,239 --> 03:27:34,760
The evil ninja.

4453
03:27:34,760 --> 03:27:41,870
What the hell is this?

4454
03:27:42,829 --> 03:27:43,389
Psych up?

4455
03:27:44,030 --> 03:27:48,920
Psych up two?

4456
03:27:50,600 --> 03:27:51,639
Psych up three.

4457
03:27:55,040 --> 03:27:56,459
What the hell am I doing?

4458
03:27:58,329 --> 03:28:11,819
To charge up power mood.

4459
03:28:11,819 --> 03:28:13,739
Yeah, but I just yell at people, right?

4460
03:28:13,739 --> 03:28:27,049
Yeah, what's the point of doing that?

4461
03:28:33,020 --> 03:28:34,219
Screaming and farting.

4462
03:28:35,739 --> 03:28:36,459
It really is.

4463
03:28:43,959 --> 03:28:45,159
I think I can fill that bar.

4464
03:28:45,159 --> 03:28:46,040
He's not going to kill me.

4465
03:28:49,200 --> 03:28:50,639
Fart and scream build.

4466
03:28:50,639 --> 03:28:51,200
I know.

4467
03:28:51,200 --> 03:28:53,280
Well, look, I didn't intend for that to happen tonight.

4468
03:28:59,340 --> 03:29:00,139
He's in close.

4469
03:29:00,139 --> 03:29:00,540
Just kill him.

4470
03:29:03,680 --> 03:29:14,200
Don't use your weapon.

4471
03:29:14,200 --> 03:29:16,280
Well, sometimes we have like a 70% chance.

4472
03:29:16,280 --> 03:29:17,079
That's good.

4473
03:29:17,079 --> 03:29:24,010
Here we go.

4474
03:29:24,010 --> 03:29:26,409
We have next coming up is another level seven.

4475
03:29:37,549 --> 03:29:38,909
Haunt is 99.

4476
03:29:39,950 --> 03:29:41,790
My god, it's so stupid.

4477
03:29:43,069 --> 03:29:44,510
It's so stupid.

4478
03:29:48,299 --> 03:29:49,659
That sword looks kind of scary.

4479
03:29:52,379 --> 03:29:53,180
No farting.

4480
03:29:54,059 --> 03:29:54,700
Yeah, I'm sorry.

4481
03:29:54,700 --> 03:29:55,659
I haven't incorporated it.

4482
03:29:56,540 --> 03:29:57,659
I got to get my rotation.

4483
03:29:58,459 --> 03:30:00,989
Okay, what happened?

4484
03:30:00,989 --> 03:30:12,860
Here comes the evil ninja.

4485
03:30:13,579 --> 03:30:20,200
Okay, let's get the crowd behind us.

4486
03:30:20,200 --> 03:30:21,959
He's got no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

4487
03:30:21,959 --> 03:30:22,360
We do not.

4488
03:30:22,360 --> 03:30:22,760
We just go.

4489
03:30:31,079 --> 03:30:43,370
Oh, come on.

4490
03:30:43,370 --> 03:30:52,200
Oh, come on.

4491
03:31:03,879 --> 03:31:04,920
Does it not work?

4492
03:31:04,920 --> 03:31:06,120
He has shout protection.

4493
03:31:07,319 --> 03:31:08,200
He has shout protection.

4494
03:31:08,200 --> 03:31:08,680
It doesn't work.

4495
03:31:10,440 --> 03:31:11,159
I can't kill him.

4496
03:31:11,159 --> 03:31:12,040
He has shout protection.

4497
03:31:18,170 --> 03:31:19,209
Where did it go?

4498
03:31:19,209 --> 03:31:20,329
Where did it go?

4499
03:31:22,280 --> 03:31:22,920
What just happened?

4500
03:31:22,920 --> 03:31:23,559
He just pulled my.

4501
03:31:32,729 --> 03:31:36,409
Am I seriously going to lose because he has like shout protection?

4502
03:31:43,469 --> 03:31:43,709
No.

4503
03:31:46,600 --> 03:31:48,700
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

4504
03:31:48,700 --> 03:31:51,979
Why did you guys tell me that was 57 fucking damage?

4505
03:31:58,639 --> 03:31:58,879
Yet.

4506
03:32:10,280 --> 03:32:11,799
Why is it not hurting him though?

4507
03:32:11,799 --> 03:32:12,600
It should be hurting him.

4508
03:32:14,639 --> 03:32:18,969
No, it don't work.

4509
03:32:18,969 --> 03:32:19,450
It doesn't work.

4510
03:32:20,090 --> 03:32:20,569
It's over.

4511
03:32:34,190 --> 03:32:37,000
Did I do it?

4512
03:32:37,000 --> 03:32:37,719
Oh, shit.

4513
03:32:37,719 --> 03:32:38,360
That was stupid.

4514
03:32:38,360 --> 03:32:39,079
Didn't do anything.

4515
03:32:50,399 --> 03:32:51,760
One of these has to land, right?

4516
03:32:53,040 --> 03:32:54,250
It says blocked.

4517
03:33:00,600 --> 03:33:01,079
Holy shit.

4518
03:33:01,079 --> 03:33:01,399
It worked.

4519
03:33:01,399 --> 03:33:02,360
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

4520
03:33:02,360 --> 03:33:04,040
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, ladies and gentlemen.

4521
03:33:04,040 --> 03:33:04,680
Hold on a second.

4522
03:33:04,680 --> 03:33:05,639
Everyone relax.

4523
03:33:06,360 --> 03:33:07,239
Everyone relax for a sec.

4524
03:33:08,120 --> 03:33:09,719
I did 57 damage.

4525
03:33:09,719 --> 03:33:10,360
We're OK.

4526
03:33:15,000 --> 03:33:15,639
We're going to be fine.

4527
03:33:16,360 --> 03:33:16,840
We're OK.

4528
03:33:20,350 --> 03:33:26,159
Good.

4529
03:33:26,159 --> 03:33:26,799
Keep doing that.

4530
03:33:26,799 --> 03:33:28,239
I hope you keep doing that.

4531
03:33:28,239 --> 03:33:28,959
Stick to the plan.

4532
03:33:29,440 --> 03:33:30,319
I'm going to stick to the plan.

4533
03:33:34,459 --> 03:33:39,530
Chad is bored to tears.

4534
03:33:40,569 --> 03:33:41,850
Oh, hold on a sec.

4535
03:33:43,049 --> 03:33:43,770
It's working.

4536
03:33:43,770 --> 03:33:44,729
Wait, it's working.

4537
03:33:44,729 --> 03:33:45,129
Just wait.

4538
03:33:52,430 --> 03:33:52,989
All right, fine.

4539
03:33:52,989 --> 03:33:53,790
You want to play that game?

4540
03:33:54,510 --> 03:34:04,219
Now you're just bored silly.

4541
03:34:06,190 --> 03:34:06,909
57.

4542
03:34:06,909 --> 03:34:07,549
Let's go.

4543
03:34:07,549 --> 03:34:08,989
Come on.

4544
03:34:08,989 --> 03:34:09,709
57 again.

4545
03:34:09,709 --> 03:34:10,590
Back to back.

4546
03:34:10,590 --> 03:34:11,549
Plus 85.

4547
03:34:13,159 --> 03:34:14,120
He's got healing potions.

4548
03:34:14,120 --> 03:34:14,680
Of course he does.

4549
03:34:16,250 --> 03:34:16,969
Get away from me.

4550
03:34:17,850 --> 03:34:19,129
Get the fuck away from me.

4551
03:34:19,129 --> 03:34:19,850
Get the fuck away from me.

4552
03:34:19,850 --> 03:34:20,409
Get away from me.

4553
03:34:28,909 --> 03:34:29,629
Get away.

4554
03:34:29,629 --> 03:34:32,270
Get away.

4555
03:34:32,270 --> 03:34:33,149
One more and it's over.

4556
03:34:38,489 --> 03:34:39,530
And we thought I was going to lose.

4557
03:34:39,530 --> 03:34:40,729
We thought I was going to lose that one.

4558
03:34:40,729 --> 03:34:41,930
No, not that one.

4559
03:34:41,930 --> 03:34:42,889
17,000 gold.

4560
03:34:42,889 --> 03:34:43,930
I'll take it.

4561
03:34:43,930 --> 03:34:59,680
What do I got on now?

4562
03:34:59,680 --> 03:35:00,239
This?

4563
03:35:00,239 --> 03:35:01,280
This is double the armor.

4564
03:35:01,840 --> 03:35:10,590
OK.

4565
03:35:10,670 --> 03:35:13,049
Shoulder guards?

4566
03:35:13,049 --> 03:35:14,649
No, I already have the best ones on.

4567
03:35:14,649 --> 03:35:15,209
No, I don't.

4568
03:35:16,590 --> 03:35:17,069
48.

4569
03:35:18,700 --> 03:35:19,180
Gauntlets.

4570
03:35:20,489 --> 03:35:20,969
Shield.

4571
03:35:20,969 --> 03:35:21,290
OK.

4572
03:35:23,200 --> 03:35:23,760
That's a big deal.

4573
03:35:25,100 --> 03:35:25,899
72 armor.

4574
03:35:25,899 --> 03:35:26,219
Let's go.

4575
03:35:29,319 --> 03:35:30,200
Greaves.

4576
03:35:30,200 --> 03:35:31,479
I have the best greaves on.

4577
03:35:32,489 --> 03:35:33,049
Chin guards.

4578
03:35:33,049 --> 03:35:34,879
Yeah, these are the worst.

4579
03:35:34,879 --> 03:35:36,239
Put these on please.

4580
03:35:36,239 --> 03:35:39,559
Improve that shoulder.

4581
03:35:39,559 --> 03:35:40,520
No, I can't.

4582
03:35:40,520 --> 03:35:43,879
Get a fucking weapon.

4583
03:35:44,440 --> 03:35:46,239
All right, I'm just going to get a weapon

4584
03:35:46,239 --> 03:35:47,280
because why wouldn't I?

4585
03:35:47,280 --> 03:35:48,479
Just give me the turkey leg.

4586
03:35:48,479 --> 03:35:48,959
Who cares?

4587
03:35:49,680 --> 03:36:00,729
I don't have money.

4588
03:36:01,370 --> 03:36:02,809
Oh, well potency two.

4589
03:36:02,809 --> 03:36:03,129
Whatever.

4590
03:36:05,239 --> 03:36:05,799
All right, let's go.

4591
03:36:07,879 --> 03:36:08,520
Sorry.

4592
03:36:08,520 --> 03:36:10,600
Sorry about that.

4593
03:36:10,600 --> 03:36:11,479
Sorry about that.

4594
03:36:11,479 --> 03:36:11,799
OK.

4595
03:36:15,129 --> 03:36:16,729
Hey, soy.

4596
03:36:16,729 --> 03:36:17,690
Soy boy.

4597
03:36:17,690 --> 03:36:18,889
Thanks for the five community subs.

4598
03:36:20,219 --> 03:36:31,819
They like me better.

4599
03:36:31,819 --> 03:36:33,260
I got way more charisma than you.

4600
03:36:40,649 --> 03:36:42,809
37,000 back in gold, dude.

4601
03:36:42,809 --> 03:36:45,530
37,000 back in gold, dude.

4602
03:36:45,530 --> 03:36:47,389
Need more stamina.

4603
03:36:48,760 --> 03:36:49,159
I'll do.

4604
03:36:49,159 --> 03:36:50,600
I'm going to just load into stamina after this.

4605
03:37:02,860 --> 03:37:03,979
No more charisma.

4606
03:37:03,979 --> 03:37:04,780
More charisma.

4607
03:37:04,780 --> 03:37:05,280
What?

4608
03:37:06,620 --> 03:37:14,680
One more.

4609
03:37:14,680 --> 03:37:17,610
One more.

4610
03:37:17,610 --> 03:37:19,639
All right, bang.

4611
03:37:19,639 --> 03:37:20,510
Got him.

4612
03:37:21,229 --> 03:37:22,770
4,400.

4613
03:37:23,409 --> 03:37:27,020
No, just do more charisma.

4614
03:37:27,020 --> 03:37:27,659
Yeah, but I don't.

4615
03:37:27,659 --> 03:37:28,860
I want to be able to land.

4616
03:37:29,579 --> 03:37:30,659
I don't know, man.

4617
03:37:30,659 --> 03:37:31,379
That seems kind of like.

4618
03:37:32,979 --> 03:37:35,139
Am I going to beat this whole game by yelling at people?

4619
03:37:35,700 --> 03:37:38,860
How can you stomach playing this for two hours?

4620
03:37:38,860 --> 03:37:39,420
I don't know.

4621
03:37:39,420 --> 03:37:40,059
Kind of just fun.

4622
03:37:40,780 --> 03:37:42,350
I've been having a good time.

4623
03:37:44,290 --> 03:37:45,090
I'm just chilling, man.

4624
03:37:45,090 --> 03:37:45,569
I'm just having.

4625
03:37:45,569 --> 03:37:46,850
I'm just hanging out having a good time.

4626
03:37:47,889 --> 03:37:49,010
We're just chilling today.

4627
03:37:50,860 --> 03:37:51,420
It's fun.

4628
03:37:51,420 --> 03:37:52,059
Yeah, it's fun.

4629
03:37:52,780 --> 03:37:59,139
How dare you stop enjoying this?

4630
03:38:02,270 --> 03:38:03,790
Just chill, screaming and farting

4631
03:38:03,790 --> 03:38:08,319
and yelling and losing to the first tutorial boss for an hour.

4632
03:38:08,319 --> 03:38:08,959
You know?

4633
03:38:08,959 --> 03:38:19,120
All right, this guy's got shout protection too.

4634
03:38:19,120 --> 03:38:20,000
There it is.

4635
03:38:20,000 --> 03:38:30,110
What is the last level in this game?

4636
03:38:30,110 --> 03:38:31,309
How hard does it go?

4637
03:38:31,309 --> 03:38:33,260
He's a little too close.

4638
03:38:37,819 --> 03:38:38,700
Goes forever.

4639
03:38:45,409 --> 03:38:46,290
Don't let him do that.

4640
03:38:46,290 --> 03:38:46,790
Okay.

4641
03:38:47,489 --> 03:38:49,540
All right, I got to level up here.

4642
03:38:50,500 --> 03:38:51,940
I'm thinking you get a new quiver.

4643
03:38:52,500 --> 03:38:52,979
Whatever.

4644
03:38:52,979 --> 03:38:57,579
I'm thinking charisma and defense.

4645
03:38:58,379 --> 03:39:00,299
Or stamina.

4646
03:39:00,299 --> 03:39:01,180
Or actually magic.

4647
03:39:03,489 --> 03:39:05,010
Stamina and charisma.

4648
03:39:05,010 --> 03:39:10,260
Okay.

4649
03:39:10,260 --> 03:39:12,129
All right, it's tournament time.

4650
03:39:12,129 --> 03:39:14,110
Tournament time.

4651
03:39:14,110 --> 03:39:15,229
What can I upgrade here?

4652
03:39:15,229 --> 03:39:15,790
Breastplate.

4653
03:39:18,670 --> 03:39:19,389
Can't do that yet.

4654
03:39:20,659 --> 03:39:21,620
How about a new helmet?

4655
03:39:21,620 --> 03:39:22,420
No.

4656
03:39:22,420 --> 03:39:25,020
I'm going to get...

4657
03:39:25,739 --> 03:39:27,440
What about boots?

4658
03:39:27,440 --> 03:39:27,940
No.

4659
03:39:29,860 --> 03:39:30,500
Chin guards?

4660
03:39:31,139 --> 03:39:32,639
No.

4661
03:39:32,639 --> 03:39:33,760
Greaves?

4662
03:39:33,760 --> 03:39:35,069
No.

4663
03:39:35,069 --> 03:39:36,030
Gauntlets?

4664
03:39:36,030 --> 03:39:38,610
Shield?

4665
03:39:38,610 --> 03:39:40,190
No.

4666
03:39:40,190 --> 03:39:41,389
Shoulders are the only thing I can do.

4667
03:39:45,010 --> 03:39:45,649
Okay.

4668
03:39:45,649 --> 03:39:48,610
All right.

4669
03:39:48,610 --> 03:39:49,409
You get the discount.

4670
03:39:49,409 --> 03:39:50,450
Try to buy it.

4671
03:39:50,450 --> 03:39:53,950
Wait, what?

4672
03:39:53,950 --> 03:39:54,909
Oh, shit.

4673
03:39:54,909 --> 03:39:57,420
Would you look at that?

4674
03:39:57,420 --> 03:39:58,059
Oh, well.

4675
03:39:58,059 --> 03:40:00,899
We'll come back.

4676
03:40:00,899 --> 03:40:01,299
Potions?

4677
03:40:01,299 --> 03:40:02,100
I can't buy potions.

4678
03:40:02,100 --> 03:40:02,579
I don't need them.

4679
03:40:03,139 --> 03:40:04,000
I don't need them.

4680
03:40:13,489 --> 03:40:16,000
I don't need them and I can't buy them anyways.

4681
03:40:16,000 --> 03:40:28,670
This game looks better than Watch Dogs.

4682
03:40:30,739 --> 03:40:31,059
I mean...

4683
03:40:33,059 --> 03:40:33,780
God.

4684
03:40:33,780 --> 03:40:34,420
That game.

4685
03:40:34,420 --> 03:40:35,459
I swear to God.

4686
03:40:37,180 --> 03:40:37,420
That's...

4687
03:40:37,420 --> 03:40:37,979
Okay.

4688
03:40:37,979 --> 03:40:39,579
That's not nominated for anything.

4689
03:40:39,579 --> 03:40:40,459
Are the game awards right?

4690
03:40:41,020 --> 03:40:43,139
Is that nominated for even one award?

4691
03:40:44,479 --> 03:40:45,600
I hope not.

4692
03:40:45,600 --> 03:40:46,319
Is it?

4693
03:40:46,319 --> 03:40:46,799
No, it's not.

4694
03:40:46,799 --> 03:40:48,559
What is it nominated for?

4695
03:40:49,200 --> 03:40:51,040
No, it is not.

4696
03:40:51,040 --> 03:40:51,680
Bullshit.

4697
03:40:51,680 --> 03:40:52,719
What's it nominated for?

4698
03:40:52,719 --> 03:40:53,120
Tell me.

4699
03:40:53,120 --> 03:40:54,239
It's not nominated for the game of the year.

4700
03:40:54,239 --> 03:40:55,420
No, it's not.

4701
03:40:55,420 --> 03:40:55,819
Nothing.

4702
03:40:55,819 --> 03:40:56,059
Good.

4703
03:40:56,700 --> 03:41:05,360
Where'd he go?

4704
03:41:05,360 --> 03:41:06,000
Oh, he's...

4705
03:41:07,700 --> 03:41:18,739
Remember, I worked so hard on that game.

4706
03:41:18,739 --> 03:41:18,979
Stop.

4707
03:41:18,979 --> 03:41:19,620
Don't...

4708
03:41:19,620 --> 03:41:20,420
Hey.

4709
03:41:20,420 --> 03:41:20,899
That's not...

4710
03:41:23,729 --> 03:41:29,739
Dude, quit hitting your bong.

4711
03:41:31,659 --> 03:41:33,680
I don't think I could hit a bong, man.

4712
03:41:33,680 --> 03:41:35,040
I really don't think I could in real life.

4713
03:41:35,040 --> 03:41:36,639
I would probably fucking fall down.

4714
03:41:37,280 --> 03:41:40,459
I would hit the bong.

4715
03:41:40,459 --> 03:41:41,020
It'd be like...

4716
03:41:49,600 --> 03:41:51,389
I gotta be...

4717
03:41:52,750 --> 03:41:55,790
Because my head would just fucking hit the table.

4718
03:41:56,430 --> 03:41:57,389
I'm not doing that.

4719
03:42:03,329 --> 03:42:03,649
No.

4720
03:42:03,649 --> 03:42:05,569
I want to be able to control exactly what I'm doing.

4721
03:42:05,569 --> 03:42:06,770
I'm back to how much I'm taking.

4722
03:42:11,569 --> 03:42:19,780
Yeah, and why did I just do that like I was eating spaghetti?

4723
03:42:19,780 --> 03:42:22,750
That was not a good bong sound.

4724
03:42:22,750 --> 03:42:25,629
That was like you're slipping up like spaghetti and meatballs.

4725
03:42:25,629 --> 03:42:28,379
What is that?

4726
03:42:30,719 --> 03:42:34,260
This is...

4727
03:42:35,219 --> 03:42:35,620
This is not...

4728
03:42:35,620 --> 03:42:36,739
I'm not even having fun.

4729
03:42:36,739 --> 03:42:38,100
This is just like screaming.

4730
03:42:38,899 --> 03:42:39,219
I'm not...

4731
03:42:39,219 --> 03:42:40,180
I feel like I'm not even playing.

4732
03:42:40,180 --> 03:42:41,780
I'm just like looking at you guys and talking.

4733
03:42:44,819 --> 03:42:47,700
I've kept my mouth in the same place, I think, for the last

4734
03:42:47,700 --> 03:42:48,739
four or five straight minutes.

4735
03:42:56,159 --> 03:42:58,940
Play Doodle God?

4736
03:42:58,940 --> 03:43:01,340
Oh, I played the absolute hell out of that a long time ago.

4737
03:43:03,020 --> 03:43:10,319
Okay, Son of Stylonius.

4738
03:43:11,360 --> 03:43:11,840
Not yet.

4739
03:43:12,399 --> 03:43:22,989
Hey, Doodle God, right now.

4740
03:43:23,870 --> 03:43:25,100
Well, link it to me.

4741
03:43:35,219 --> 03:43:37,840
Turn off the stream.

4742
03:43:37,840 --> 03:43:38,079
What?

4743
03:43:38,799 --> 03:43:39,440
I'm not done yet.

4744
03:43:45,729 --> 03:43:52,030
Remember, he hits the bong and dies.

4745
03:43:52,030 --> 03:43:52,430
Hold on.

4746
03:43:53,069 --> 03:43:59,469
Remember, he hits the bong and dies.

4747
03:43:59,469 --> 03:44:00,110
Let's hear this.

4748
03:44:00,989 --> 03:44:03,229
Curious.

4749
03:44:20,299 --> 03:44:22,059
Not what I intended for that to sound like.

4750
03:44:22,059 --> 03:44:23,340
I wanted that to sound like this.

4751
03:44:24,219 --> 03:44:26,579
I wanted it to sound like this.

4752
03:44:27,379 --> 03:44:30,930
For some reason, when I go through the stream,

4753
03:44:31,940 --> 03:44:36,110
I don't know why, but I'm going to leave it on this for a little while.

4754
03:44:39,219 --> 03:44:41,299
Hold on.

4755
03:44:41,299 --> 03:44:41,860
Is it?

4756
03:44:41,860 --> 03:44:42,899
Let's find out.

4757
03:44:42,899 --> 03:44:44,639
Let me find out.

4758
03:44:44,639 --> 03:44:45,680
Let me find out if it's...

4759
03:44:45,680 --> 03:44:46,479
Let me find out.

4760
03:44:46,479 --> 03:44:47,520
Let me find out.

4761
03:44:48,479 --> 03:44:51,659
Now, let me tell you.

4762
03:44:51,659 --> 03:44:52,299
I am not...

4763
03:44:53,420 --> 03:44:56,620
Madam Secretary, I am not going to stand down here

4764
03:44:56,620 --> 03:44:57,979
and not give a stimulus.

4765
03:44:58,540 --> 03:44:59,180
No, no.

4766
03:44:59,180 --> 03:45:01,180
The American people are going to be just fine.

4767
03:45:01,180 --> 03:45:01,979
They're going to be fine.

4768
03:45:06,780 --> 03:45:09,659
Mitch McConnell has a joker laugh, by the way.

4769
03:45:09,659 --> 03:45:12,370
Listen to Mitch McConnell laugh at something.

4770
03:45:12,370 --> 03:45:14,209
He does the Jared Leto joker.

4771
03:45:16,819 --> 03:45:17,459
Seriously, it's like...

4772
03:45:19,899 --> 03:45:23,360
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.

4773
03:45:23,360 --> 03:45:30,540
How do you laugh like that?

4774
03:45:31,100 --> 03:45:33,920
Think about it, people that...

4775
03:45:33,920 --> 03:45:34,959
You know, when you laugh, you just go...

4776
03:45:35,520 --> 03:45:35,920
Or like...

4777
03:45:41,469 --> 03:45:46,940
Is that political?

4778
03:45:46,940 --> 03:45:49,459
Political.

4779
03:45:52,590 --> 03:45:59,819
All right, here he comes.

4780
03:46:00,459 --> 03:46:01,899
Son of Stylonius.

4781
03:46:02,459 --> 03:46:03,950
Scream at him.

4782
03:46:03,950 --> 03:46:04,670
I win.

4783
03:46:04,670 --> 03:46:05,309
Scream at him.

4784
03:46:05,309 --> 03:46:06,110
I win.

4785
03:46:06,110 --> 03:46:06,750
Scream at him.

4786
03:46:06,750 --> 03:46:07,229
I win.

4787
03:46:07,229 --> 03:46:07,790
Nice fart.

4788
03:46:07,790 --> 03:46:09,149
I can match your fart with a fart, too.

4789
03:46:09,149 --> 03:46:10,030
You want to get farts on?

4790
03:46:10,030 --> 03:46:10,430
All right, fine.

4791
03:46:10,430 --> 03:46:10,829
Let's go.

4792
03:46:11,709 --> 03:46:21,329
Oh, he's charging something.

4793
03:46:22,049 --> 03:46:22,450
Nice.

4794
03:46:22,450 --> 03:46:23,250
Okay, you missed.

4795
03:46:24,209 --> 03:46:36,340
People are wildly entertained by that, too.

4796
03:46:36,340 --> 03:46:37,219
Oh, he's burnt.

4797
03:46:43,059 --> 03:46:47,229
Piss on him.

4798
03:46:47,229 --> 03:46:48,670
You can't even pee on people in this game.

4799
03:46:49,629 --> 03:46:51,069
And if you can, I don't know.

4800
03:46:51,069 --> 03:46:52,350
I'm not going to probably unlock it yet.

4801
03:47:05,700 --> 03:47:06,420
I won.

4802
03:47:06,420 --> 03:47:10,290
Congratulations, you have won.

4803
03:47:12,930 --> 03:47:17,299
I kind of feel like I have not been in the arena yet.

4804
03:47:19,629 --> 03:47:20,270
Okay.

4805
03:47:20,270 --> 03:47:23,309
Emperor Antares has granted you 22,500 gold.

4806
03:47:24,110 --> 03:47:30,180
The hour is late.

4807
03:47:30,180 --> 03:47:31,540
Okay, find a tavern.

4808
03:47:31,540 --> 03:47:32,420
Sleep peacefully.

4809
03:47:45,940 --> 03:47:46,819
All right, that was fun.

4810
03:47:46,819 --> 03:47:48,260
I'm going to move on to Doodle God now.

4811
03:47:48,819 --> 03:47:50,739
Let's move on.

4812
03:47:50,739 --> 03:47:51,540
Let's do Doodle God.

4813
03:47:52,100 --> 03:47:53,700
Yeah, this game is cool.

4814
03:47:53,700 --> 03:47:54,979
But like, I don't know.

4815
03:47:54,979 --> 03:47:57,059
I don't want to just yell at people for another hour or something.

4816
03:47:58,299 --> 03:47:58,860
That's too much.

4817
03:48:00,459 --> 03:48:00,860
I like it.

4818
03:48:00,860 --> 03:48:01,659
It's a really fun game.

4819
03:48:01,659 --> 03:48:02,379
And I remember it.

4820
03:48:02,379 --> 03:48:03,260
It's very nostalgic.

4821
03:48:04,700 --> 03:48:10,850
But we are going to do this.

4822
03:48:12,379 --> 03:48:13,020
Doodle God.

4823
03:48:15,180 --> 03:48:16,299
I remember this game.

4824
03:48:17,790 --> 03:48:20,690
Might be a little too big.

4825
03:48:20,690 --> 03:48:23,649
Let's make it a little bit smaller.

4826
03:48:25,250 --> 03:48:26,370
Okay, a little.

4827
03:48:26,370 --> 03:48:27,090
Just a little.

4828
03:48:27,090 --> 03:48:27,569
Okay.

4829
03:48:27,569 --> 03:48:31,329
Remember, you normally just yell at us for hours.

4830
03:48:31,329 --> 03:48:32,049
What?

4831
03:48:32,049 --> 03:48:32,899
I don't.

4832
03:48:32,899 --> 03:48:33,459
You do that to me.

4833
03:48:34,180 --> 03:48:36,049
All right, Doodle God, play.

4834
03:48:36,930 --> 03:48:39,579
You can now play Doodle God on your phone.

4835
03:48:39,579 --> 03:48:40,219
Check it out.

4836
03:48:40,219 --> 03:48:42,540
iPhone version has priority in getting updates.

4837
03:48:43,260 --> 03:48:46,670
In the beginning, there was only Doodle God.

4838
03:48:46,670 --> 03:48:50,979
Doodle God created the four basic elements.

4839
03:48:50,979 --> 03:48:52,819
Earth, water, fire, air.

4840
03:48:53,700 --> 03:48:57,299
From Earth, Doodle God created the planets.

4841
03:48:57,299 --> 03:49:03,709
From water, seas, and oceans were created.

4842
03:49:04,579 --> 03:49:07,620
From fire were created volcanoes and other stuff.

4843
03:49:08,340 --> 03:49:11,459
From air, you know, the world is still vast.

4844
03:49:11,459 --> 03:49:12,340
I know what the game is.

4845
03:49:13,059 --> 03:49:13,700
Okay, here we go.

4846
03:49:14,500 --> 03:49:18,260
We're going to do we're going to do fire and we're going to do Earth.

4847
03:49:18,899 --> 03:49:22,899
And that is going to make stone lava.

4848
03:49:24,020 --> 03:49:27,219
If your heart is a volcano, how shall you expect flowers to bloom?

4849
03:49:27,219 --> 03:49:28,020
They get quotes.

4850
03:49:28,659 --> 03:49:29,620
Okay, cool.

4851
03:49:29,620 --> 03:49:31,379
There's a new element in the group now.

4852
03:49:33,659 --> 03:49:34,299
Yeah, there is.

4853
03:49:34,299 --> 03:49:35,260
Now we have lava.

4854
03:49:35,819 --> 03:49:38,139
We can do lava and Earth.

4855
03:49:38,139 --> 03:49:42,370
Earth and lava equals the same thing Earth and fire do.

4856
03:49:42,370 --> 03:49:45,969
How about air and lava, steam, stone?

4857
03:49:49,979 --> 03:49:54,399
We have stone and water equals sand.

4858
03:49:58,399 --> 03:49:58,799
Cool.

4859
03:49:58,799 --> 03:50:04,270
Now we can do let's do air, air and sand.

4860
03:50:05,549 --> 03:50:08,430
Air and Earth creates dust.

4861
03:50:09,790 --> 03:50:21,170
How about fire and sand makes glass?

4862
03:50:21,170 --> 03:50:22,530
I know that from Minecraft.

4863
03:50:23,170 --> 03:50:24,989
I know that from Minecraft.

4864
03:50:25,790 --> 03:50:27,790
Teaching children all these things too.

4865
03:50:27,790 --> 03:50:29,629
Don't forget that your little brother plays Minecraft.

4866
03:50:30,270 --> 03:50:32,319
It's teaching him things.

4867
03:50:32,319 --> 03:50:38,639
Dust and glass, dust and stone, dust and sand, dust and Earth, air and dust.

4868

03:50:44,780 --> 03:50:45,260
There it is.

4870
03:50:49,729 --> 03:50:54,620
How about steam and fire equals plasma?

4871
03:50:56,239 --> 03:50:57,280
Glass and steam.

4872
03:51:03,059 --> 03:51:06,260
Fire and steam, fire and dust is ash.

4873
03:51:06,899 --> 03:51:08,690
Who suggested this?

4874
03:51:08,690 --> 03:51:09,329
I don't know, man.

4875
03:51:09,329 --> 03:51:10,290
We're just jumping around.

4876
03:51:11,090 --> 03:51:12,860

Turn off the game sounds.

4881
03:51:37,860 --> 03:51:38,659
All right.

4882
03:51:38,659 --> 03:51:39,780
You don't like them?

4883
03:51:39,780 --> 03:51:41,540
You're too loud.

4884
03:51:45,020 --> 03:51:54,590
Okay, Earth, sand and sand, sand and stone.

03:58:47,870 --> 03:58:50,319
So it's so much fun to try all the combos.

4977
03:58:50,319 --> 03:58:54,020
Yeah, it is.

4978
03:58:54,020 --> 03:58:57,840
How about kind of something with bird?

4979
03:58:58,829 --> 03:59:06,819
Bird and weeds, moss and bird, and life and bird, no?

4980
03:59:06,819 --> 03:59:10,959
How do we make a life and sand to seeds?

4981
03:59:10,959 --> 03:59:14,799
Here we go, seeds and water is plants, right?

4982
03:59:14,799 --> 03:59:16,000
I mean, that's very obvious, right?

4983
03:59:16,000 --> 03:59:16,479
It has to be.

4984
03:59:18,049 --> 03:59:20,370
Seeds and water, fucking dumb game.

4985
03:59:22,030 --> 03:59:22,350
Really?

4986
03:59:25,010 --> 03:59:28,930
Seeds and grass, kidding me?

4987
03:59:30,049 --> 03:59:36,819
Life and seeds, egg seeds, energy and seeds.

4988
03:59:36,819 --> 03:59:38,030
What?

4989
03:59:38,030 --> 03:59:43,760
Seeds and bird, what the fuck?

4990
03:59:43,760 --> 04:00:01,860
Seeds and Earth, tree, tree and bird, bird family.

4991
04:00:01,860 --> 04:00:03,780
Tree and tree is forest.

4992
04:00:04,899 --> 04:00:05,379
Seeds?

4993
04:00:06,020 --> 04:00:12,500
What about air and tree?

4994
04:00:12,500 --> 04:00:13,549
Anything?

4995
04:00:15,219 --> 04:00:19,219
Tree and dust, steam tree, ash tree, storm tree.

4996
04:00:19,219 --> 04:00:26,559
I'm not gonna, I can't do it.

4997
04:00:26,559 --> 04:00:27,200
I can't do it.

4998
04:00:27,200 --> 04:00:32,129
Those are all last names of different Warcraft characters.

4999
04:00:33,010 --> 04:00:34,290
Whatever, I'm not gonna do it.

5000
04:00:34,290 --> 04:00:35,329
You know what I was gonna do.

5001
04:00:35,329 --> 04:00:36,049
I'm not gonna do it.

5002
04:00:36,049 --> 04:00:42,430
I refuse.

5003
04:00:42,430 --> 04:00:48,959
Shadowlands, game's got the fastest selling PC games of all time.

5004
04:00:48,959 --> 04:00:50,479
It really changed a bunch of stuff for the better.

5005
04:00:50,479 --> 04:00:57,040
It's like, it's pretty, I mean, it's a stupid fucking game.

5006
04:00:57,040 --> 04:01:01,040
I don't know why, if you play that game, then you seriously have to be dumb.

5007
04:01:01,200 --> 04:01:04,079
There's no way you're not dumb if you play that, right?

5008
04:01:04,079 --> 04:01:10,850
I don't play.

5009
04:01:10,850 --> 04:01:13,010
Why is it the fastest selling PC game ever?

5010
04:01:13,010 --> 04:01:13,969
Fucking game sucks.

5011
04:01:19,180 --> 04:01:20,459
Energy and phoenix.

5012
04:01:20,459 --> 04:01:23,899
No, energy and, there's gotta be something else here.

5013
04:01:23,899 --> 04:01:26,030
Egg and here we go.

5014
04:01:26,030 --> 04:01:26,590
Dinosaur.

5015
04:01:27,389 --> 04:01:30,639
Entrairian loser.

5016
04:01:30,639 --> 04:01:32,639
No, game's fucking stupid, like dumb game.

5017
04:01:35,260 --> 04:01:37,180
All those warlock changes look pretty fun.

5018
04:01:37,180 --> 04:01:39,180
Fucking stupid game, stupid shitty game.

5019
04:01:41,940 --> 04:01:43,459
Air and dinosaur is dragon.

5020
04:01:48,299 --> 04:01:49,500
This is not funny.

5021
04:01:55,120 --> 04:01:56,719
Somebody's actually really upset today.

5022
04:01:57,120 --> 04:01:57,840
This is for real.

5023
04:01:58,639 --> 04:01:59,120
Sorry.

5024
04:01:59,120 --> 04:01:59,760
I'm sorry.

5025
04:02:00,399 --> 04:02:02,299
Look, all right, I bought it.

5026
04:02:02,299 --> 04:02:03,100
All right, I bought it.

5027
04:02:03,100 --> 04:02:03,659
And what are you gonna do?

5028
04:02:03,659 --> 04:02:04,379
Are you gonna be mad at me?

5029
04:02:04,379 --> 04:02:05,340
Are you gonna yell at me?

5030
04:02:05,340 --> 04:02:08,079
I bought it and I played it.

5031
04:02:08,079 --> 04:02:09,440
You're gonna be upset with me about this?

5032
04:02:13,180 --> 04:02:14,940
Fine, I'm gonna admit you.

5033
04:02:14,940 --> 04:02:15,739
Here we go.

5034
04:02:15,739 --> 04:02:18,379
I bought Shadowlands and guess what?

5035
04:02:18,379 --> 04:02:19,579
I'm having some fun.

5036
04:02:19,579 --> 04:02:21,579
Not that, not very much, but I'm having fun with it.

5037
04:02:21,579 --> 04:02:22,780
It's very good so far.

5038
04:02:22,780 --> 04:02:23,819
I've played it a little bit.

5039
04:02:24,459 --> 04:02:33,659
Kill this man.

5040
04:02:34,540 --> 04:02:42,129
He bought Shadowlands, oh mega low.

5041
04:02:42,129 --> 04:02:44,610
Look, I haven't played the game since Legion and I was just looking at it.

5042
04:02:45,819 --> 04:02:47,180
I haven't played it for like two weeks.

5043
04:02:47,180 --> 04:02:50,370
I just told you.

5044
04:02:50,370 --> 04:02:51,170
How dare you?

5045
04:02:51,969 --> 04:02:53,729
I know, like what the fuck?

5046
04:02:53,729 --> 04:03:00,370
Add Shadowlands to the dead.

5047
04:03:00,370 --> 04:03:00,690
Why?

5048
04:03:00,690 --> 04:03:01,409
Because I bought it?

5049
04:03:02,129 --> 04:03:03,219
He wasn't sick.

5050
04:03:03,219 --> 04:03:04,420
He was playing Shadowlands.

5051
04:03:04,420 --> 04:03:05,459
Now that's horseshit.

5052
04:03:05,459 --> 04:03:06,340
That's not even real.

5053
04:03:06,340 --> 04:03:08,260
You know, I actually was, I was.

5054
04:03:09,139 --> 04:03:10,420
It's not even real.

5055
04:03:10,420 --> 04:03:21,979
The truth comes out.

5056
04:03:21,979 --> 04:03:24,219
No, no, are you kidding me?

5057
04:03:24,219 --> 04:03:28,719
I would not stop streaming for like a week to play Shadowlands.

5058
04:03:29,280 --> 04:03:33,100
I've just been, I've like smelled it a few times.

5059
04:03:33,100 --> 04:03:44,500
I would not do that.

5060
04:03:45,459 --> 04:03:47,870
A tree in life.

5061
04:03:47,870 --> 04:03:50,299
A tree in, oh my god.

5062
04:03:50,299 --> 04:03:51,579
Just like that game, just like that game.

5063
04:03:51,579 --> 04:03:52,940
World of Warcraft with the tree.

5064
04:03:52,940 --> 04:03:54,620
It's where the, at Mount Hyjal.

5065
04:03:55,180 --> 04:04:08,340
I mean, why are you doing this?

5066
04:04:09,979 --> 04:04:11,340
That could mean a lot of different things.

5067
04:04:11,899 --> 04:04:13,420
Why am I talking about Shadowlands?

5068
04:04:13,420 --> 04:04:14,700
Why did I admit that I bought Shadowlands?

5069
04:04:14,700 --> 04:04:15,739
Why am I playing flash games?

5070
04:04:15,739 --> 04:04:16,700
Why am I playing Doodle God?

5071
04:04:16,700 --> 04:04:18,219
Why have I not played Cyberpunk?

5072
04:04:18,219 --> 04:04:19,260
Why are you not playing Cyberpunk?

5073
04:04:19,260 --> 04:04:19,979
I mean, I could answer that.

5074
04:04:19,979 --> 04:04:21,100
That depends on what you mean.

5075
04:04:21,659 --> 04:04:23,260
There's a lot of different answers there.

5076
04:04:23,260 --> 04:04:32,540
All right, what's sand and where's the Swiss Swamp?

5077
04:04:32,540 --> 04:04:39,569
Swiss Swamp.

5078
04:04:49,020 --> 04:04:49,819
Clay, okay, cool.

5079
04:04:54,139 --> 04:04:58,430
How about clay and clay and earth?

5080
04:04:59,920 --> 04:05:03,040
Stone and clay, sand and clay, glass and clay.

5081
04:05:05,120 --> 04:05:07,520
Life and clay, that's gonna be a golem.

5082
04:05:08,319 --> 04:05:15,500
Cool, all right.

5083
04:05:15,500 --> 04:05:18,059
What about dragon and, dragon and fire?

5084
04:05:18,059 --> 04:05:22,059
Did I make like a fire dragon?

5085
04:05:27,899 --> 04:05:29,340
Life and go, I made a human.

5086
04:05:29,340 --> 04:05:30,379
There it is, finally.

5087
04:05:30,379 --> 04:05:30,860
I did it.

5088
04:05:31,420 --> 04:05:34,659
Wait, you actually bought Shadowlands.

5089
04:05:34,659 --> 04:05:35,459
No, I didn't.

5090
04:05:36,100 --> 04:05:37,940
I did not.

5091
04:05:39,180 --> 04:05:40,700
Human and human is baby.

5092
04:05:41,659 --> 04:05:42,219
Sex.

5093
04:05:48,290 --> 04:05:54,780
Sex and, let's see.

5094
04:05:55,899 --> 04:05:59,500
Sex and, sex and water?

5095
04:06:00,219 --> 04:06:01,180
Sex in the swamp?

5096
04:06:03,819 --> 04:06:04,940
Sex on the beach?

5097
04:06:06,860 --> 04:06:07,899
Sex in the backyard?

5098
04:06:10,959 --> 04:06:14,319
Nope, sex on the, it sucks, sex up in a tree.

5099
04:06:17,540 --> 04:06:25,860
Passion and sex, sex and eggs.

5100
04:06:25,860 --> 04:06:27,540
I don't know, sex and eggs.

5101
04:06:28,510 --> 04:06:31,309
Sex and energy, it's like, whatever.

5102
04:06:31,309 --> 04:06:32,909
I'm starting to get a little weird here.

5103
04:06:32,909 --> 04:06:33,870
Sex and sex.

5104
04:06:37,100 --> 04:06:38,459
I'm trying to combine stuff.

5105
04:06:43,219 --> 04:06:45,139
Sex and sex is sex too.

5106
04:06:45,139 --> 04:06:46,739
Sex with a dinosaur.

5107
04:06:49,299 --> 04:06:50,979
I want to click it, but I can't.

5108
04:06:53,899 --> 04:06:55,979
God, God is sitting in the clouds.

5109
04:06:55,979 --> 04:06:58,700
Oh my God, sex, oh, sex in a tree.

5110
04:06:58,700 --> 04:07:01,739
Sex in the water, oh, sex with a dinosaur.

5111
04:07:01,739 --> 04:07:02,459
Sex with a bird.

5112
04:07:04,610 --> 04:07:07,520
What else, I wonder what else we could do.

5113
04:07:10,860 --> 04:07:12,379
Sex with a dragon.

5114
04:07:13,620 --> 04:07:14,659
Sex with a ghost.

5115
04:07:19,149 --> 04:07:24,739
Sex, he just had a whiteboard,

5116
04:07:24,739 --> 04:07:26,180
just writing all this shit down.

5117
04:07:26,899 --> 04:07:31,229
No, no, no, oh, sex while playing the harmonica.

5118
04:07:31,229 --> 04:07:31,950
Yeah, that's a good one.

5119
04:07:31,950 --> 04:07:32,909
I think I'll do that one too.

5120
04:07:41,969 --> 04:07:43,729
Steam and sand.

5121
04:07:43,729 --> 04:07:51,569
No, I keep doing steam and swamp and sand.

5122
04:07:52,370 --> 04:07:53,250
No, I did that already.

5123
04:07:54,530 --> 04:07:56,770
Fire, yeah, fire and clay, that's a good one.

5124
04:08:01,059 --> 04:08:02,420
Makes bricks.

5125
04:08:03,379 --> 04:08:05,219
New element, structure.

5126
04:08:06,260 --> 04:08:07,219
Bricks and water.

5127
04:08:08,620 --> 04:08:09,659
Bricks and life.

5128
04:08:10,459 --> 04:08:11,420
Energy and bricks.

5129
04:08:11,420 --> 04:08:12,620
Eggs and bricks.

5130
04:08:12,620 --> 04:08:13,659
Seeds and bricks.

5131
04:08:13,659 --> 04:08:14,940
Sex and bricks.

5132
04:08:14,940 --> 04:08:16,059
Bricks and sex.

5133
04:08:17,809 --> 04:08:19,569
I don't know what, I don't know what you're doing.

5134
04:08:20,129 --> 04:08:21,649
Um, I don't know why you need a brick.

5135
04:08:22,850 --> 04:08:23,889
Okay, never mind.

5136
04:08:24,610 --> 04:08:26,129
Like, um, what?

5137
04:08:45,899 --> 04:08:46,780
Dude, no.

5138
04:08:47,819 --> 04:08:49,979
Hold on, I'm starting to like see stars.

5139
04:08:49,979 --> 04:08:52,219
That was, I laughed too hard very quickly.

5140
04:08:52,219 --> 04:08:52,620
Hold on.

5141
04:08:54,139 --> 04:08:55,340
Smash with a brick.

5142
04:08:55,340 --> 04:08:58,379
No, guys, that's ridiculous.

5143
04:09:04,670 --> 04:09:06,750
That would fucking hurt so bad.

5144
04:09:15,540 --> 04:09:19,840
All right, I'm gonna be all right.

5145
04:09:19,840 --> 04:09:20,559
I'm gonna be fine.

5146
04:09:22,719 --> 04:09:25,040
What's, what's the, the bricks and the bees?

5147
04:09:25,040 --> 04:09:25,920
The birds and the bricks?

5148
04:09:26,559 --> 04:09:27,819
The birds and the bees?

5149
04:09:33,729 --> 04:09:34,850
The birds and the bricks.

5150
04:09:37,819 --> 04:09:43,420
Okay, how about bricks and sand?

5151
04:09:43,420 --> 04:09:44,379
Bricks and earth?

5152
04:09:45,420 --> 04:09:46,379
Bricks and stone.

5153
04:09:48,299 --> 04:09:48,860
Clay and bricks.

5154
04:09:48,860 --> 04:09:49,979
How do you make a house?

5155
04:09:49,979 --> 04:09:50,780
Bricks and glass?

5156
04:09:51,579 --> 04:10:03,700
How about human and brick?

5157
04:10:04,420 --> 04:10:09,120
That's not gonna work.

5158
04:10:09,920 --> 04:10:13,469
You know, can I tell you guys,

5159
04:10:14,190 --> 04:10:17,709
one of my favorite words in the English language is brick.

5160
04:10:18,670 --> 04:10:21,069
It's the perfect word for what that is.

5161
04:10:23,809 --> 04:10:25,489
I love that word.

5162
04:10:25,489 --> 04:10:27,489
When you think of the word brick,

5163
04:10:28,129 --> 04:10:31,969
you just see this heavy, thick, dense,

5164
04:10:32,959 --> 04:10:36,239
just clump of fucking a heavy, dense thing.

5165
04:10:39,329 --> 04:10:40,690
It's just, I love the word.

5166
04:10:40,690 --> 04:10:41,809
It's perfect.

5167
04:10:41,809 --> 04:10:45,739
Why is he not playing Nitro?

5168
04:10:45,739 --> 04:10:46,459
I will in a second.

5169
04:10:46,459 --> 04:10:47,100
Hold on.

5170
04:10:47,100 --> 04:10:53,149
Dinosaur and water.

5171
04:10:53,149 --> 04:10:55,309
It's like a water dinosaur, right?

5172
04:10:55,309 --> 04:10:57,020
Dinosaur and swamp?

5173
04:10:57,659 --> 04:10:58,620
Alligator?

5174
04:10:58,620 --> 04:11:02,459
Hey, Morty, I turned myself into a brick.

5175
04:11:02,459 --> 04:11:03,819
No, that's not funny.

5176
04:11:03,819 --> 04:11:06,219
If it was a pickle, I might have laughed at it.

5177
04:11:06,219 --> 04:11:23,299
That wouldn't be baby.

5178
04:11:23,299 --> 04:11:24,930
Pickle, brick.

5179
04:11:24,930 --> 04:11:25,969
All right, that's enough.

5180
04:11:25,969 --> 04:11:27,170
Tobacco and free.

5181
04:11:27,170 --> 04:11:36,590
What am I looking for?

5182
04:11:37,389 --> 04:11:40,030
I don't want to do that, but oh, coal.

5183
04:11:46,059 --> 04:11:46,940
Sex and life.

5184
04:11:53,309 --> 04:11:54,270
Sex and egg.

5185
04:11:54,270 --> 04:11:55,629
No, sex and life didn't work.

5186
04:11:56,430 --> 04:12:03,600
Human and brick.

5187
04:12:03,600 --> 04:12:05,040
I already did a human and brick.

5188
04:12:05,040 --> 04:12:06,000
It didn't do anything.

5189
04:12:06,879 --> 04:12:07,680
Oh my God.

5190
04:12:09,420 --> 04:12:10,299
Human and moss.

5191
04:12:10,940 --> 04:12:11,899
Human and weeds.

5192
04:12:11,899 --> 04:12:13,979
Can I make like a swamp person?

5193
04:12:15,360 --> 04:12:16,239
Fire and human.

5194
04:12:17,489 --> 04:12:37,899
Oh, corpse and air.

5195
04:12:37,899 --> 04:12:38,459
I don't know.

5196
04:12:38,459 --> 04:12:41,680
Corpse and dust.

5197
04:12:41,680 --> 04:12:42,319
Corpse and...

5198
04:12:43,120 --> 04:12:44,399
What about corpse and life?

5199
04:12:46,209 --> 04:12:46,690
Zombie.

5200
04:12:50,260 --> 04:12:59,440
Zombie and coal.

5201
04:12:59,440 --> 04:12:59,840
I don't know.

5202
04:12:59,840 --> 04:13:01,040
I'm trying to get away from...

5203
04:13:02,459 --> 04:13:03,579
I'm trying to get away from...

5204
04:13:04,459 --> 04:13:05,500
I'm trying to get away from...

5205
04:13:06,059 --> 04:13:07,700
I'm trying to get away from...

5206
04:13:09,700 --> 04:13:10,819
I'm trying to get away from...

5207
04:13:10,819 --> 04:13:11,780
What's the new game?

5208
04:13:11,780 --> 04:13:12,420
What was the new game?

5209
04:13:12,420 --> 04:13:13,780
Was it called Nitroam or something?

5210
04:13:17,819 --> 04:13:18,780
Bricks and coal.

5211
04:13:23,780 --> 04:13:25,059
Yeah, that's a good one.

5212
04:13:25,059 --> 04:13:27,979
Wait, what's coal?

5213
04:13:34,139 --> 04:13:34,860
Brick and coal.

5214
04:13:35,500 --> 04:13:36,379
No, nothing.

5215
04:13:36,379 --> 04:13:38,190
Remember, you good?

5216
04:13:38,190 --> 04:13:39,149
I'm fine.

5217
04:13:39,149 --> 04:13:44,379
I need another building material.

5218
04:13:44,379 --> 04:13:45,180
How do you build a house?

5219
04:13:45,180 --> 04:13:45,579
Wood.

5220
04:13:45,579 --> 04:13:46,219
Where's wood?

5221
04:13:46,219 --> 04:13:47,100
Where the hell's wood?

5222
04:13:47,659 --> 04:13:49,020
Tree and axe.

5223
04:13:49,020 --> 04:13:49,579
Where's wood?

5224
04:13:50,139 --> 04:13:51,409
Where's tree?

5225
04:13:53,309 --> 04:13:56,030
Tree and something to break it.

5226
04:13:56,590 --> 04:13:57,389
Life and tree?

5227
04:13:58,110 --> 04:14:00,819
No, that's tree and...

5228
04:14:02,899 --> 04:14:03,700
Brick and brick.

5229
04:14:04,860 --> 04:14:05,500
Mud and brick.

5230
04:14:05,500 --> 04:14:06,459
Yeah, how do you make mud?

5231
04:14:07,020 --> 04:14:07,819
Earth and water?

5232
04:14:08,459 --> 04:14:09,579
I think I've already done that.

5233
04:14:10,219 --> 04:14:11,899
Yeah, I already did that.

5234
04:14:13,020 --> 04:14:13,739
Water and clay?

5235
04:14:15,649 --> 04:14:23,809
I need tools.

5236
04:14:23,809 --> 04:14:24,930
Yeah, how do I make tools?

5237
04:14:25,889 --> 04:14:28,700
Human and vodka.

5238
04:14:29,500 --> 04:14:36,450
Alcoholic.

5239
04:14:36,450 --> 04:14:36,690
What?

5240
04:14:37,889 --> 04:14:41,459
What?

5241
04:14:41,459 --> 04:14:42,180
Alcoholic?

5242
04:14:42,899 --> 04:14:45,149
And I don't understand.

5243
04:14:45,870 --> 04:14:46,110
What?

5244
04:14:46,829 --> 04:14:54,659
Human and corpse.

5245
04:14:56,239 --> 04:14:56,639
About...

5246
04:14:58,719 --> 04:14:59,840
Egg and corpse.

5247
04:14:59,840 --> 04:15:01,040
Energy and corpse.

5248
04:15:01,040 --> 04:15:01,840
Human and energy.

5249
04:15:03,100 --> 04:15:03,739
A wizard!

5250
04:15:13,649 --> 04:15:23,739
Fire wizard.

5251
04:15:23,739 --> 04:15:26,340
Coal wizard.

5252
04:15:26,340 --> 04:15:28,340
Oh, that face went no wizard.

5253
04:15:28,340 --> 04:15:28,739
Sex.

5254
04:15:33,309 --> 04:15:42,530
Oh, my fucking face hurts right now.

5255
04:15:42,530 --> 04:15:43,409
It's so stupid.

5256
04:15:44,209 --> 04:15:45,250
Wizard and energy.

5257
04:15:46,659 --> 04:15:48,739
Who makes a demigod?

5258
04:15:51,409 --> 04:15:53,969
Okay, if you have sex with a demigod,

5259
04:15:55,860 --> 04:15:59,790
that means that that's how like...

5260
04:15:59,790 --> 04:16:04,020
Isn't that like...

5261
04:16:04,020 --> 04:16:08,510
Yeah, aren't they like Dante, right?

5262
04:16:08,510 --> 04:16:12,780
This makes a quarter god.

5263
04:16:12,780 --> 04:16:17,180
Hercules.

5264
04:16:17,739 --> 04:16:19,700
Somebody said Dante.

5265
04:16:19,700 --> 04:16:20,819
Yeah, Dante.

5266
04:16:20,819 --> 04:16:23,379
Is Dante from Devil May Cry a quarter god?

5267
04:16:24,020 --> 04:16:35,840
Don't you feel like that eventually?

5268
04:16:35,840 --> 04:16:39,329
If let's say like, you know, demigods were, you know, procreating,

5269
04:16:39,329 --> 04:16:41,649
you know, procreating, and they were, you know, demigods,

5270
04:16:41,649 --> 04:16:45,409
and now you have, you know, just like a human and a demigod,

5271
04:16:45,409 --> 04:16:46,690
and then, you know, eventually you get to the point

5272
04:16:46,690 --> 04:16:51,659
where you have like, like 2% demigod on like Ancestry.com.

5273
04:16:52,219 --> 04:16:55,440
He would be like, I'm a demigod!

5274
04:16:55,440 --> 04:16:55,920
That's me!

5275
04:16:58,620 --> 04:17:00,459
They'd be like, just you stand over there, man.

5276
04:17:00,459 --> 04:17:02,379
I'm gonna try to like shoot fireballs at you.

5277
04:17:02,940 --> 04:17:04,239
Like, that's not how it works, dude.

5278
04:17:04,239 --> 04:17:04,959
Just fucking relax.

5279
04:17:06,899 --> 04:17:09,940
Yeah, like fucking like 27 million years ago,

5280
04:17:10,819 --> 04:17:11,620
you had a demigod.

5281
04:17:11,620 --> 04:17:12,180
Okay, whatever.

5282
04:17:12,979 --> 04:17:23,739
And he said, I thought the gladiator yelling was boring,

5283
04:17:23,739 --> 04:17:25,260
but you managed to outdo yourself.

5284
04:17:25,260 --> 04:17:26,459
I'll time that person up for an hour.

5285
04:17:27,840 --> 04:17:28,879
No, I'll do it.

5286
04:17:28,879 --> 04:17:30,139
What's your name?

5287
04:17:30,139 --> 04:17:30,860
I don't remember you.

5288
04:17:31,500 --> 04:17:32,559
There you are.

5289
04:17:33,700 --> 04:17:34,659
There you are.

5290
04:17:35,219 --> 04:17:37,440
There they go.

5291
04:17:38,079 --> 04:17:38,639
Right click.

5292
04:17:39,780 --> 04:17:42,180
Ban for 72 days.

5293
04:17:42,739 --> 04:17:48,799
Oh, he actually died.

5294
04:17:48,799 --> 04:17:49,760
You actually died about.

5295
04:17:51,620 --> 04:17:56,079
All right, after 10 minutes, reverse that ban.

5296
04:17:56,079 --> 04:18:06,239
I just want them to know what they did.

5297
04:18:06,479 --> 04:18:07,600
Egg and grass?

5298
04:18:07,600 --> 04:18:14,780
I feel like I need to do more stuff with eggs.

5299
04:18:14,780 --> 04:18:18,459
Human plus computer.

5300
04:18:19,100 --> 04:18:20,700
I don't have a computer.

5301
04:18:20,700 --> 04:18:24,739
Do brick and brick.

5302
04:18:24,739 --> 04:18:25,700
Would that actually do anything?

5303
04:18:26,260 --> 04:18:32,899
Where is brick?

5304
04:18:32,899 --> 04:18:34,020
Okay, brick and brick.

5305
04:18:34,819 --> 04:18:37,059
No, that's not gonna do anything.

5306
04:18:37,940 --> 04:18:45,040
Brick and corpse.

5307
04:18:45,680 --> 04:18:51,280
No, I tried that already.

5308
04:18:51,280 --> 04:18:52,399
Clay and water.

5309
04:18:52,399 --> 04:18:56,940
I'm gonna like lose track where everything is.

5310
04:18:56,940 --> 04:18:58,739
Clay and water.

5311
04:18:58,739 --> 04:18:59,780
Let's go for it.

5312
04:18:59,780 --> 04:19:04,639
No, swamp and...

5313
04:19:05,440 --> 04:19:08,299
I need to make mud or like cement.

5314
04:19:18,700 --> 04:19:19,420
Bacteria.

5315
04:19:19,420 --> 04:19:19,979
Oh shit.

5316
04:19:19,979 --> 04:19:21,020
Okay, hold on.

5317
04:19:23,260 --> 04:19:26,379
Bacteria and dinosaur?

5318
04:19:27,250 --> 04:19:28,959
Bacteria and...

5319
04:19:28,959 --> 04:19:29,760
Not that.

5320
04:19:29,760 --> 04:19:43,760
Come on, earth and bacteria.

5321
04:19:43,760 --> 04:19:44,639
Stone and...

5322
04:19:44,639 --> 04:19:46,879
I could make some kind of animal, right?

5323
04:19:46,879 --> 04:19:50,129
Bird bacteria.

5324
04:19:50,129 --> 04:19:51,010
Water bacteria.

5325
04:19:51,010 --> 04:19:51,969
Energy bacteria.

5326
04:19:51,969 --> 04:19:52,930
Life bacteria.

5327
04:19:52,930 --> 04:19:54,049
Egg bacteria.

5328
04:19:54,049 --> 04:19:57,020
Look, I'm just gonna do it because I have to.

5329
04:19:57,020 --> 04:19:58,139
Water and bacteria.

5330
04:19:58,139 --> 04:19:58,780
There we go.

5331
04:19:58,780 --> 04:20:00,079
Oh, plankton.

5332
04:20:00,079 --> 04:20:00,579
Okay.

5333
04:20:01,940 --> 04:20:03,299
Plankton and...

5334
04:20:03,299 --> 04:20:05,940
Plankton and energy.

5335
04:20:05,940 --> 04:20:07,260
Plankton and egg.

5336
04:20:07,260 --> 04:20:07,979

Sand and worm.

5353
04:20:43,229 --> 04:20:44,129
There's a snake.

5354
04:20:44,129 --> 04:20:45,090
All right, we got another animal.

5355
04:20:45,889 --> 04:20:50,450
Bird and worm.

5356
04:20:50,450 --> 04:20:51,010
Let's try that.

5358
04:20:58,770 --> 04:20:59,170

5359
04:20:59,170 --> 04:21:00,049

04:21:00,049 --> 04:21:00,850

There's a lizard.

5364
04:21:05,170 --> 04:21:08,079
I still need...

5365
04:21:08,079 --> 04:21:08,799
I make bricks.

5366
04:21:09,440 --> 04:21:11,569

5381
04:21:34,159 --> 04:21:34,659
Okay.

Fish and...

5383
04:21:37,899 --> 04:21:38,700
I don't know.

5384
04:21:38,700 --> 04:21:39,579
Fish and what?

5385
04:21:39,579 --> 04:21:40,059
Fish and...

5386
04:21:41,629 --> 04:21:42,030

Lizard and fire.

5393
04:21:59,659 --> 04:22:00,700
You just burn it.

5394
04:22:06,659 --> 04:22:08,959
Just toss the lizard in the fire.

5395
04:22:08,959 --> 04:22:10,000
Why would you do that?

5396
04:22:10,000 --> 04:22:10,479
I don't know.

5397
04:22:10,479 --> 04:22:11,200
I just...

5398
04:22:11,200 --> 04:22:12,479
It's on the whiteboard, I guess.

5399
04:22:12,479 --> 04:22:13,280
I don't know.

5400
04:22:13,280 --> 04:22:21,940
Let's take it off.

5401
04:22:21,940 --> 04:22:23,219

Fish and...

5409
04:22:38,030 --> 04:22:39,870
I'm surprised fish and water doesn't make something else.

5410
04:22:39,870 --> 04:22:40,750
I guess it is just a fish.

5411
04:22:41,780 --> 04:22:43,870
Lizard zombie.

5412
04:22:43,870 --> 04:22:44,829

No, I'm talking about like...

5425
04:23:14,879 --> 04:23:15,680
It's just a term.

5426
04:23:15,680 --> 04:23:17,040
It's not like you...

5427
04:23:18,000 --> 04:23:21,120
It's not you having sex with a lizard, okay?

5428
04:23:21,200 --> 04:23:25,040
It's just the terminology for like procreation.

5429
04:23:37,629 --> 04:23:39,229
I feel like I haven't been using fire for anything.

5430
04:23:39,229 --> 04:23:40,590
Fire and bacteria.

5431
04:23:40,590 --> 04:23:41,309
Beetle fire.

5432
04:23:42,030 --> 04:23:42,989
Worm and lava.

5433
04:23:42,989 --> 04:23:43,709
Fire and worm.

5434
04:23:43,709 --> 04:23:44,829
There we go.

04:24:00,190 --> 04:24:01,309
What? Tobacco and human.

5439
04:24:01,950 --> 04:24:02,909
I haven't tried that at all.

5440
04:24:11,729 --> 04:24:12,690
Fish and plankton.

5441
04:24:12,690 --> 04:24:13,329
Hmm.

5442
04:24:13,329 --> 04:24:13,889
Good call.

5443
04:24:14,780 --> 04:24:15,579
That's a really good call.

5444
04:24:17,620 --> 04:24:18,100
Look at that.

5445
04:24:19,299 --> 04:24:20,340
It made a whale.

5446
04:24:20,340 --> 04:24:21,620

Like, I don't even have a lot of fun, but...

5453
04:24:36,700 --> 04:24:37,819
I mean, it's on the app store.

5454
04:24:37,819 --> 04:24:38,299
Go get it.

5455
04:24:40,979 --> 04:24:42,899

I already did it.

Do beetle and sand.

5476
04:25:26,110 --> 04:25:26,430
Okay.

5477
04:25:29,440 --> 04:25:30,559
Sand and beetle, you said?

5478
04:25:32,739 --> 04:25:33,059
Sand.

5479
04:25:33,059 --> 04:25:33,620
That's not right.

5480
04:25:33,620 --> 04:25:34,659
Here, it's over here.

5481
04:25:34,659 --> 04:25:37,600
Oh, scorpion.

5482
04:25:37,600 --> 04:25:37,920
Nice.

It's fun.

5487
04:25:44,719 --> 04:25:45,360
We'll change.

5488
04:25:45,360 --> 04:25:45,760

We'll change.

5490
04:25:46,479 --> 04:25:48,399

I haven't done fire and stone yet.

5501
04:26:14,940 --> 04:26:15,579
Are you serious?

5502
04:26:16,299 --> 04:26:17,469
How have I not done that?

5503
04:26:19,010 --> 04:26:19,489
What?

5504
04:26:19,489 --> 04:26:20,530
How have I not done that?

5505
04:26:27,469 --> 04:26:28,829
Metal and brick equals house.

04:27:18,899 --> 04:27:19,620
Ash tools.

5530
04:27:19,620 --> 04:27:20,420
Storm tools.

5531
04:27:22,530 --> 04:27:26,340
Brick and tools.

5532
04:27:26,340 --> 04:27:28,639
What?

5533
04:27:28,639 --> 04:27:31,280
Earth and tools is field, okay.

5534
04:27:32,239 --> 04:27:37,280
About metal and tools, obviously, right?

5535
04:27:37,280 --> 04:27:39,950
It has to be metal and tools.

5536
04:27:39,950 --> 04:27:40,829
Weapon.

5537
04:27:40,829 --> 04:27:42,750
Human and weapon is going to make like a fighter.

5538
04:27:42,750 --> 04:27:46,440
Hunter.

5539
04:27:47,219 --> 04:27:51,600
Hunter and beast equals food.

5540
04:27:55,780 --> 04:27:57,620
Meat, wool, and blood.

5541
04:27:57,620 --> 04:28:01,750
Okay.

5542
04:28:02,370 --> 04:28:05,700
Meat, what is it like?

5543
04:28:05,700 --> 04:28:06,500
Lettuce, like meat?

5544
04:28:06,500 --> 04:28:09,600
Okay, meat, lettuce, tomato.

5545
04:28:09,600 --> 04:28:18,819
It's like a whopper, like it comes together.

5546
04:28:18,819 --> 04:28:20,420
Wool and human.

5547
04:28:20,420 --> 04:28:21,760
Sweater.

5548
04:28:21,760 --> 04:28:26,739
Corpse meat.

5549
04:28:26,739 --> 04:28:28,020
Wizard meat.

5550
04:28:28,020 --> 04:28:31,979
Tools and wool.

5551
04:28:31,979 --> 04:28:36,110
It's your fabric.

5552
04:28:36,110 --> 04:28:37,309
Meat and fire.

5553
04:28:37,309 --> 04:28:42,739
It's a good one.

5554
04:28:42,739 --> 04:28:44,020
Wow, okay.

5555
04:28:44,020 --> 04:28:45,819
That's actually pretty surprising.

5556
04:28:48,879 --> 04:28:55,629
Tools and meat.

5557
04:28:55,629 --> 04:28:59,020
Brick and tool.

5558
04:28:59,020 --> 04:29:01,659
Okay, I'm surprised brick and tool doesn't do anything.

5559
04:29:01,659 --> 04:29:03,040
Tools and fabric.

5560
04:29:03,040 --> 04:29:03,600
No.

5561
04:29:03,600 --> 04:29:06,719
Water and fabric.

5562
04:29:06,719 --> 04:29:07,200
Alcohol.

5563
04:29:07,940 --> 04:29:09,139
Water and field.

5564
04:29:09,139 --> 04:29:10,860
No, okay.

5565
04:29:10,860 --> 04:29:12,059
Grass and field.

5566
04:29:12,059 --> 04:29:15,020
Blood and field.

5567
04:29:15,020 --> 04:29:16,459
Blood and bricks.

5568
04:29:16,459 --> 04:29:17,420
Blood and life.

5569
04:29:17,420 --> 04:29:19,739
That sounds like a good one.

5570
04:29:19,739 --> 04:29:20,540
Blood and egg.

5571
04:29:20,540 --> 04:29:21,260
Energy and blood.

5572
04:29:24,770 --> 04:29:25,649
I'm not going to do it.

5573
04:29:25,649 --> 04:29:27,790
I'm not going to click that.

5574
04:29:27,790 --> 04:29:28,270
Seeds.

5575
04:29:28,270 --> 04:29:28,829
Oh, fire.

5576
04:29:28,829 --> 04:29:29,329
Yeah.

5577
04:29:30,110 --> 04:29:30,829
Seeds and fields.

5578
04:29:30,829 --> 04:29:31,469
You're right.

5579
04:29:31,469 --> 04:29:35,889
Where are those seeds?

5580
04:29:35,889 --> 04:29:41,200
Hey, where's the seeds?

5581
04:29:41,760 --> 04:29:42,399
What do I do with them?

5582
04:29:42,959 --> 04:29:43,680
There.

5583
04:29:43,680 --> 04:29:45,440
Seed and field equals crops.

5584
04:29:46,799 --> 04:29:55,360
Air and blood.

5585
04:29:55,360 --> 04:29:56,319
Blood and storm.

5586
04:29:59,549 --> 04:30:00,510
Blood and snake.

5587
04:30:00,510 --> 04:30:01,629
Lizard blood.

5588
04:30:01,629 --> 04:30:02,350
Bird blood.

5589
04:30:02,350 --> 04:30:02,850
No.

5590
04:30:03,229 --> 04:30:05,420
Grass blood.

5591
04:30:05,420 --> 04:30:06,379
Tree blood.

5592
04:30:06,379 --> 04:30:07,100

04:30:08,700 --> 04:30:09,659
Fire and blood.

5594
04:30:12,799 --> 04:30:18,459
Blood with water?

5595
04:30:18,459 --> 04:30:18,959
No.

5596
04:30:22,850 --> 04:30:24,129
Tree and tools.

5597
04:30:24,129 --> 04:30:24,610
There you go.

5598
04:30:24,610 --> 04:30:25,170
Wood.

5599
04:30:25,170 --> 04:30:25,889
Finally.

5600
04:30:25,889 --> 04:30:26,770
That took forever.

5601
04:30:30,270 --> 04:30:31,870
Now let's go with wood and...

5602
04:30:33,649 --> 04:30:34,850
Wood and tools again, right?

5603
04:30:34,850 --> 04:30:35,350
Yeah.

5604
04:30:35,729 --> 04:30:36,370
Makes a wheel.

5605
04:30:40,479 --> 04:30:41,680
Blood and stone.

5606
04:30:44,540 --> 04:30:45,920
Blood and earth.

5607
04:30:45,920 --> 04:30:46,879
Blood and metal.

5608
04:30:46,879 --> 04:30:47,680
Blood and sand.

5609
04:30:47,680 --> 04:30:48,559
Blood and...

5610
04:30:48,559 --> 04:30:49,280
It doesn't do anything.

5611
04:30:49,280 --> 04:30:50,000
Blood and clay.

5612
04:30:55,809 --> 04:30:56,770
Blood and weapon.

5613
04:30:57,409 --> 04:30:58,370
Oh, that's not a bad idea.

5614
04:31:00,340 --> 04:31:03,700
Too bad.

5615
04:31:03,700 --> 04:31:04,739
Ooh, blood and zombie.

5616
04:31:05,299 --> 04:31:06,579
Meat and zombie, right?

5617
04:31:06,579 --> 04:31:07,299
That would be a good one.

5618
04:31:10,260 --> 04:31:15,020
Blood and blood.

5619
04:31:16,129 --> 04:31:20,340
Hmm, I tried that.

5620
04:31:20,340 --> 04:31:21,379
Coal and fire.

5621
04:31:28,959 --> 04:31:29,840
Blood and human.

5622
04:31:32,930 --> 04:31:33,489
Oh, shit.

5623
04:31:34,290 --> 04:31:35,010
Vampire?

5624
04:31:35,889 --> 04:31:36,690
Vampire.

5625
04:31:37,709 --> 04:31:39,389
Okay, vampire and wood

5626
04:31:39,389 --> 04:31:40,510
is like a stake through the heart

5627
04:31:40,510 --> 04:31:43,620
which makes a corpse, right?

5628
04:31:50,319 --> 04:31:51,360
Sex and vampire.

5629
04:31:51,920 --> 04:31:56,059
A human vampire is just

5630
04:31:56,059 --> 04:31:57,500
a double vampire, I guess?

5631
04:31:59,780 --> 04:32:02,579
Wheel and energy.

5632
04:32:02,579 --> 04:32:06,239
What could I do with wheel?

5633
04:32:08,260 --> 04:32:08,979
Wool and wheel?

5634
04:32:09,540 --> 04:32:10,989
No.

5635
04:32:10,989 --> 04:32:11,709
Tools and wheel.

5636
04:32:13,260 --> 04:32:14,299
Wood and...

5637
04:32:14,299 --> 04:32:15,020
Metal and wheel.

5638
04:32:15,659 --> 04:32:16,299
Stone and wheel.

5639
04:32:17,020 --> 04:32:17,340
Really?

5640
04:32:17,340 --> 04:32:18,219
Glass and wheel?

5641
04:32:18,219 --> 04:32:18,620
Come on.

5642
04:32:25,260 --> 04:32:26,459
Brick and wheel?

5643
04:32:26,459 --> 04:32:27,020
No?

5644
04:32:27,020 --> 04:32:28,299
Oh, there we go.

5645
04:32:28,299 --> 04:32:28,799
Cart.

5646
04:32:31,969 --> 04:32:33,329
Steam and metal, somebody said.

5647
04:32:33,329 --> 04:32:33,829
I'll try it.

5648
04:32:37,950 --> 04:32:40,770
Steam and metal.

5649
04:32:40,770 --> 04:32:42,420
Hell yeah.

5650
04:32:42,420 --> 04:32:42,920
Boiler.

5651
04:32:48,260 --> 04:32:49,059
Cart and...

5652
04:32:49,059 --> 04:32:49,940
Wheel and animal?

5653
04:32:49,940 --> 04:32:50,739
Cart and animal?

5654
04:32:50,739 --> 04:32:51,239
Hold on.

5655
04:32:59,120 --> 04:33:00,079
Wheel and animal.

5656
04:33:02,909 --> 04:33:03,709
Cart and animal.

5657
04:33:04,349 --> 04:33:05,310
Wheel and beast.

04:33:06,349 --> 04:33:07,470
Cart and lizard.

5660
04:33:07,470 --> 04:33:08,750
Snake cart.

5661
04:33:08,830 --> 04:33:09,790
Wheel dinosaur.

5662
04:33:09,790 --> 04:33:10,290
No.

5663
04:33:11,580 --> 04:33:12,619
Boiler and human.

5664
04:33:14,659 --> 04:33:17,040
Okay.

5665
04:33:17,040 --> 04:33:17,680
No.

5666
04:33:17,680 --> 04:33:18,959
Boiler and hunter.

5667
04:33:18,959 --> 04:33:19,680
Weapon and human.

5668
04:33:19,680 --> 04:33:20,240
I already got it.

5669
04:33:23,040 --> 04:33:24,080
Wheel, whale.

5670
04:33:26,139 --> 04:33:27,580
I haven't done anything with meat.

5671
04:33:27,580 --> 04:33:28,860
How have I not done anything with meat?

5672
04:33:28,860 --> 04:33:30,619
How about life and meat?

5673
04:33:32,130 --> 04:33:33,409
Energy and meat?

5674
04:33:33,409 --> 04:33:35,779
How have I not found anything?

5675
04:33:36,740 --> 04:33:37,380
Human meat.

5676
04:33:38,369 --> 04:33:39,169
Hunter meat.

5677
04:33:40,299 --> 04:33:41,340
Alcoholic meat.

5678
04:33:41,340 --> 04:33:42,060
Wizard meat.

5679
04:33:42,060 --> 04:33:42,540
What can I do?

5680
04:33:46,209 --> 04:33:46,930
Hunter and...

5681
04:33:47,490 --> 04:33:48,610
What about some of these other animals?

5682
04:33:48,610 --> 04:33:49,330
Hunter and bird.

5683
04:33:50,419 --> 04:33:50,979
Oh, feather.

5684
04:33:50,979 --> 04:33:51,479
Okay.

5685
04:33:53,540 --> 04:33:54,340
All right.

5686
04:33:54,340 --> 04:33:55,819
Let's do...

5687
04:33:55,819 --> 04:33:56,779
I want to do hunter on the other one.

5688
04:33:56,779 --> 04:33:57,580
On everything else too.

5689
04:33:59,299 --> 04:34:02,029
Hunter and dinosaur.

5690
04:34:03,889 --> 04:34:04,930
Is just blood.

5691
04:34:04,930 --> 04:34:05,430
Okay.

5692
04:34:08,849 --> 04:34:13,729
Hunter and snake.

5693
04:34:14,529 --> 04:34:15,889

5696
04:34:18,130 --> 04:34:20,110
Hunter and beast.

5697
04:34:20,110 --> 04:34:20,430
Okay.

5698
04:34:20,430 --> 04:34:21,389
What about hunter and...

5699
04:34:21,389 --> 04:34:21,889
Okay.

5700
04:34:26,139 --> 04:34:27,419
Tree and tool.

5701
04:34:27,419 --> 04:34:29,169
I think I did wood already, right?

5702
04:34:29,169 --> 04:34:29,669
Yeah.

5703
04:34:32,110 --> 04:34:38,139
Human and snake.

5704
04:34:38,139 --> 04:34:39,020
Oh, nope.

5705
04:34:39,020 --> 04:34:40,299
That was a pretty good idea though.

5706
04:34:40,299 --> 04:34:41,180
That was a good idea.

5707
04:34:42,060 --> 04:34:43,099
Hunter and vampire.

5708
04:34:43,580 --> 04:34:46,099

Hunter and dragon.

5713
04:34:52,159 --> 04:34:52,659
What?

5714
04:34:53,599 --> 04:34:56,000
Oh, I get it.

5715
04:34:56,560 --> 04:34:57,279
The hunter's dead.

5716
04:35:00,540 --> 04:35:01,740
Energy and demigod.

5717
04:35:11,889 --> 04:35:13,490
Energy and wizard is demigod.

5718
04:35:13,490 --> 04:35:15,169
So energy and demigod makes...

5719
04:35:16,430 --> 04:35:16,930
What?

5720
04:35:18,830 --> 04:35:19,869
Life and demigod?

5721
04:35:20,509 --> 04:35:21,470
Blood and demigod.

5722
04:35:21,470 --> 04:35:23,310
Well, demigods don't have blood.

5723
04:35:23,310 --> 04:35:26,819
They don't like electricity or something.

5724
04:35:34,700 --> 04:35:35,819
Yeah, I got to combine wheat with something.

5725
04:35:41,439 --> 04:35:45,439
The boiler and the wheel.

5726
04:35:45,520 --> 04:35:49,020

5727
04:35:49,020 --> 04:35:49,520

5741
04:36:11,740 --> 04:36:12,779

04:36:17,790 --> 04:36:18,509
Tools and cart.

5746
04:36:18,509 --> 04:36:21,020
No, really.

5747
04:36:21,020 --> 04:36:22,220
Hunter and hunter.

5748
04:36:22,220 --> 04:36:22,720

04:36:27,139 --> 04:36:28,849
Hunter, hunter.

5752
04:36:28,849 --> 04:36:29,650
Doesn't do anything.

5753
04:36:29,650 --> 04:36:30,529
Hunter and human...

5754
04:36:30,529 --> 04:36:31,250
Human hunter?

5755
04:36:36,139 --> 04:36:37,099
Water and wheel.

5756
04:36:37,099 --> 04:36:37,599
Smart.

5757
04:36:38,500 --> 04:36:39,060
Very smart.

5758
04:36:39,790 --> 04:36:40,830
Hunter x hunter.

5759
04:36:42,500 --> 04:36:43,459
Um, oh.

5760
04:36:43,459 --> 04:36:44,580
All right, never mind.

5761
04:36:44,580 --> 04:36:50,270
Let's do water and wheel.

5762
04:36:50,270 --> 04:36:51,549
Wait, water and field?

5763
04:36:52,509 --> 04:36:53,069
No.

5764
04:36:53,069 --> 04:36:53,790
Water and wood?

5765
04:36:54,939 --> 04:36:55,439
Boat!

5766
04:36:58,259 --> 04:37:02,979
Cool. All right, I got a boat.

5767
04:37:02,979 --> 04:37:04,259
But what was the last one you guys want to do?

5768
04:37:04,259 --> 04:37:06,610
Water and what?

5769
04:37:06,610 --> 04:37:07,810
Water and human.

5770
04:37:07,810 --> 04:37:09,009

Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5776
04:37:17,389 --> 04:37:17,950

A boat in a swamp.

5782
04:37:30,099 --> 04:37:31,299
Energy in the wheel.

5783
04:37:31,299 --> 04:37:32,740
I'm gonna try everything with the wheel, actually.

5784
04:37:32,740 --> 04:37:39,229
Let's go.

5785
04:37:39,229 --> 04:37:40,189
No, okay.

Storm in the wheel.

5809
04:38:08,029 --> 04:38:08,669
Storm in the cart.

5810
04:38:08,669 --> 04:38:09,709
And storm in the boat.

5811
04:38:09,709 --> 04:38:13,360
We've got a bird in the wheel.

5812
04:38:14,479 --> 04:38:15,599
We've got a bird in the wheel.

5813
04:38:15,599 --> 04:38:16,319

A dinosaur.

5819
04:38:19,919 --> 04:38:21,119
That's too many syllables.

5820
04:38:21,119 --> 04:38:25,790
Animal in cart.

5821
04:38:25,790 --> 04:38:26,909
I'm surprised this one doesn't work.

5822
04:38:26,909 --> 04:38:31,700
Fish boat.

5823
04:38:31,700 --> 04:38:32,819
What's storm in metal?

5824
04:38:34,020 --> 04:38:34,979
That's a good...

5825
04:38:34,979 --> 04:38:37,380
This is such a chill day right now.

5826
04:38:37,380 --> 04:38:37,939
I'm just chilling.

5827
04:38:37,939 --> 04:38:38,819
You guys chilling?

5828
04:38:38,819 --> 04:38:40,619
This is kind of nice.

5829
04:38:40,619 --> 04:38:41,500
I like this.

5830
04:38:41,500 --> 04:38:44,529
Storm in metal.

5831
04:38:44,529 --> 04:38:45,330
No, fuck you.

5832
04:38:45,330 --> 04:38:45,810
Fuck you.

5833
04:38:45,810 --> 04:38:46,529
No, you suck.

5834
04:38:46,529 --> 04:38:47,090
Fuck you.

5835
04:38:47,090 --> 04:38:47,650
No, no.

5836
04:38:47,650 --> 04:38:49,169
Oh my god.

5837
04:38:49,169 --> 04:38:50,770
What the hell?

5838
04:38:50,770 --> 04:38:54,130
What's going on here?

5839
04:38:54,130 --> 04:38:55,490
You guys are making me sad.

5840
04:38:55,490 --> 04:38:57,569
Storm in metal.

5841
04:38:57,569 --> 04:38:58,049
Nope.

5842
04:38:58,049 --> 04:39:09,979
Metal and energy, mate.

5843
04:39:09,979 --> 04:39:15,139
Oh, here we go.

5844
04:39:15,139 --> 04:39:18,259
A countess flagrant.

5845
04:39:18,259 --> 04:39:21,630
Boosie?

5846
04:39:21,630 --> 04:39:25,389
Boochie?

5847
04:39:25,389 --> 04:39:32,319
Energy in metal.

5848
04:39:32,319 --> 04:39:33,630
Dude.

5849
04:39:33,630 --> 04:39:34,750
Oh, yes.

5850
04:39:34,750 --> 04:39:41,200
Fabric and feathers, please.

5851
04:39:41,200 --> 04:39:42,479
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

5852
04:39:42,479 --> 04:39:46,849
But I got electricity.

5853
04:39:46,849 --> 04:39:47,569
Zombie and...

5854
04:39:47,569 --> 04:39:49,330
What's electricity and stone?

5855
04:39:49,330 --> 04:39:50,290
Electricity and metal.

5856
04:39:50,290 --> 04:39:51,889
Oh, electricity and stone.

5857
04:39:51,889 --> 04:39:55,090
Electricity and glass.

5858
04:39:55,090 --> 04:39:56,450
Fire and electricity.

5859
04:39:56,450 --> 04:40:01,500
Boat and electricity.

5860
04:40:01,500 --> 04:40:02,299
Motorboat.

5861
04:40:02,299 --> 04:40:09,470
Water and wind.

5862
04:40:09,470 --> 04:40:10,029
Oh, wait.

5863
04:40:10,029 --> 04:40:10,590
I got steam.

5864
04:40:13,380 --> 04:40:18,049
Electricity and human.

5865
04:40:18,049 --> 04:40:19,009
Just electrocute them?

5866
04:40:29,180 --> 04:40:30,060
Boiler and coal.

5867
04:40:31,380 --> 04:40:36,990
Go for it.

5868
04:40:36,990 --> 04:40:37,709
Damn, there it is.

5869
04:40:38,270 --> 04:40:39,229
Steam engine.

5870
04:40:39,229 --> 04:40:39,729
Okay.

5871
04:40:40,349 --> 04:40:41,950
Now we're getting real.

5872
04:40:41,950 --> 04:40:48,319
Steam engine and tools.

5873
04:40:48,959 --> 04:40:50,830
Steam engine and weapon.

5874
04:40:50,830 --> 04:40:52,110
Steam engine and cart.

5875
04:40:58,080 --> 04:40:59,360
Steam engine and steam.

5876
04:40:59,919 --> 04:41:01,180
Does that sound...

5877
04:41:01,900 --> 04:41:02,779
Oh.

5878
04:41:02,779 --> 04:41:07,310
Electricity boiler.

5879
04:41:09,139 --> 04:41:09,700
Yeah, you know what?

5880
04:41:09,700 --> 04:41:11,299
We're going to do some spamming here.

5881
04:41:11,299 --> 04:41:14,220
Because I really feel like electricity is going to work with so much stuff.

5882
04:41:14,220 --> 04:41:15,020
Electricity, energy.

5883
04:41:15,020 --> 04:41:15,740
Let's just go for it.

5884
04:41:16,380 --> 04:41:19,619
Electricity, egg.

5885
04:41:19,619 --> 04:41:20,580
Electricity, sex.

5886
04:41:21,139 --> 04:41:21,860
Seeds, no.

5887
04:41:23,150 --> 04:41:24,349
Meat, electricity, wool.

5888
04:41:25,229 --> 04:41:27,389
I have feathers too.

5889
04:41:34,799 --> 04:41:35,040
No.

5890
04:41:36,700 --> 04:41:37,740
Electricity, scorpion.

5891
04:41:38,380 --> 04:41:42,080
Electricity, metal.

5892
04:41:42,080 --> 04:41:42,560
No.

5893
04:41:42,560 --> 04:41:43,360
None of this works.

5894
04:41:44,319 --> 04:41:57,470
Electric, snake.

5895
04:41:57,470 --> 04:41:58,189
Hold on.

5896
04:41:58,189 --> 04:42:02,860
Electricity, water.

5897
04:42:02,860 --> 04:42:03,740
Alcohol.

5898
04:42:03,740 --> 04:42:04,220
Swamp.

5899
04:42:04,220 --> 04:42:04,540
Really?

5900
04:42:05,099 --> 04:42:11,040
Electricity and snake.

5901
04:42:11,040 --> 04:42:11,439
No.

5902
04:42:11,439 --> 04:42:11,759
Damn it.

5903
04:42:15,099 --> 04:42:15,580
No.

5904
04:42:15,580 --> 04:42:17,180
Guys, we're not trying to make Pokemon here.

5905
04:42:17,180 --> 04:42:19,259
We're trying to combine elements.

5906
04:42:19,900 --> 04:42:26,849
Use one of the hints.

5907
04:42:27,490 --> 04:42:33,740
Some of these may react.

5908
04:42:33,740 --> 04:42:34,939
Vodka and lava.

5909
04:42:34,939 --> 04:42:35,659
Swamp and coal.

5910
04:42:36,220 --> 04:42:37,099

Where the hell is it?

5921
04:42:55,150 --> 04:43:04,939
What did I not do?

5922
04:43:04,939 --> 04:43:05,900
Water and fire?

5923
04:43:05,900 --> 04:43:06,619

Hunter and bread.

6056
04:49:19,009 --> 04:49:19,889
Well, you don't hunt bread.

6057
04:49:19,889 --> 04:49:20,770
You just make it.

6058
04:49:22,290 --> 04:49:23,009
Bread and meat.

6059
04:49:23,650 --> 04:49:24,750

Fire and meat.

6069
04:49:53,040 --> 04:49:53,599
Yeah, I tried that.

6070
04:49:53,599 --> 04:49:54,400
It didn't do anything.

6071
04:49:54,400 --> 04:49:54,900
That's weird.

6072
04:49:58,139 --> 04:49:58,860

Yeah.

6083
04:50:26,419 --> 04:50:27,060
If there's anything else.

04:50:59,599 --> 04:51:02,319
Where'd it go?

6092
04:51:02,319 --> 04:51:03,819
Where is it?

6093
04:51:03,819 --> 04:51:04,880
Where's the hut?

6094
04:51:04,880 --> 04:51:10,049
Where the hell did it go?

6095
04:51:10,049 --> 04:51:12,340
Am I stupid?

6096
04:51:12,819 --> 04:51:15,889
What is it?

6097
04:51:15,889 --> 04:51:16,450

Oh my god.

6101
04:51:25,549 --> 04:51:26,189
I was looking under...

6102
04:51:26,189 --> 04:51:27,229
I was...

6103
04:51:27,229 --> 04:51:28,669

6104
04:51:28,669 --> 04:51:29,310

Yeah, that would be so funny

6110
04:51:42,450 --> 04:51:44,529
if they did like a dumb branded version.

6111
04:51:44,529 --> 04:51:45,490
I know it would be stupid,

6112
04:51:45,490 --> 04:51:47,409
but if you could eventually make like a king

6113
04:51:48,049 --> 04:51:49,169
and you had like a burger

6114
04:51:49,169 --> 04:51:50,770
and you could make Burger King or something.

6115
04:51:52,430 --> 04:51:53,470
Nobody would think that was cool,

6116
04:51:53,470 --> 04:51:55,229
but like three of us here.

6117
04:51:56,400 --> 04:51:58,400

A book and worm.

6476
05:08:31,659 --> 05:08:32,860

Hold on.

6481
05:08:49,259 --> 05:08:50,060
Weed and swamp.

6482
05:08:50,060 --> 05:08:51,180
Oh, that's a no-brainer.

6483
05:08:59,450 --> 05:09:00,169
Oh, it didn't work.

6484
05:09:01,049 --> 05:09:01,849
Book and house.

6485
05:09:03,990 --> 05:09:05,029
Okay, book and house.

6486
05:09:05,590 --> 05:09:10,279
What about book and human?

6487
05:09:10,279 --> 05:09:11,959
Like scholar or something?

6488
05:09:11,959 --> 05:09:12,459
No.

6489
05:09:12,919 --> 05:09:18,900
Book and...

6490
05:09:18,900 --> 05:09:22,279
I don't know.

6491
05:09:22,279 --> 05:09:23,159
Book and house?

6492
05:09:23,159 --> 05:09:23,720
No.

6493
05:09:23,720 --> 05:09:24,360

05:09:27,909 --> 05:09:29,189
Brick and steam engine.

6496
05:09:29,189 --> 05:09:30,229
Wait, give it to me.

6497
05:09:30,229 --> 05:09:30,869
All right, let's go.

6498
05:09:32,470 --> 05:09:33,110
Ash and...

6499
05:09:33,110 --> 05:09:33,750
I'm gonna do ash.

6500
05:09:40,810 --> 05:09:41,290
No.

6501
05:09:41,290 --> 05:09:42,090
Storm worm.

6502
05:09:43,290 --> 05:09:44,009

6503
05:09:45,779 --> 05:09:46,580

05:09:51,669 --> 05:09:52,549
Steam beetle.

6506
05:09:59,319 --> 05:10:00,040
Dust?

6507
05:10:00,040 --> 05:10:00,520
Weed?

6508
05:10:00,520 --> 05:10:01,240
Dust beetle?

6509
05:10:04,180 --> 05:10:05,299
Steamed weeds.

6510
05:10:06,939 --> 05:10:08,139
That's gotta be air then.

6511
05:10:08,139 --> 05:10:08,779
Whatever.

6512
05:10:08,779 --> 05:10:10,459
Air and weeds.

6513
05:10:10,459 --> 05:10:11,099
Air beetle.

6514
05:10:12,790 --> 05:10:13,669

6515
05:10:16,020 --> 05:10:17,220

05:10:18,740 --> 05:10:19,619
Air worm?

6518
05:10:21,240 --> 05:10:21,740
Oh.

6519
05:10:24,520 --> 05:10:25,880
Last one I possibly could have done.

6520
05:10:25,880 --> 05:10:26,919
Okay, butterfly.

6521
05:10:26,919 --> 05:10:27,419
Ten more.

6522
05:10:27,959 --> 05:10:34,330
What about lizard shell?

6523
05:10:34,889 --> 05:10:37,479
I'll try it.

6524
05:10:38,099 --> 05:10:42,419

6525
05:10:42,419 --> 05:10:43,139

05:10:46,680 --> 05:10:47,639
Butterfly lizard.

6529
05:10:48,279 --> 05:10:50,630
Clay and gum powder.

6530
05:10:51,189 --> 05:10:52,889
Let's try clay and gum powder.

6531
05:10:53,529 --> 05:10:59,689
Do snake and oil.

6532
05:11:04,869 --> 05:11:06,549
Okay, I have not used wheat.

6533
05:11:07,189 --> 05:11:08,310
I've used wheat like once.

6534
05:11:09,110 --> 05:11:10,229
Feather once.

6535
05:11:10,229 --> 05:11:11,270
Wool like once.

6536
05:11:14,709 --> 05:11:15,590
Worm and shell.

6537
05:11:21,500 --> 05:11:23,000
I guess I could try it.

6538
05:11:23,000 --> 05:11:23,880
Yeah, let me try these.

6539
05:11:24,520 --> 05:11:33,779
Do glass with glass and house.

6540
05:11:34,419 --> 05:11:36,549
Try it.

6541
05:11:36,549 --> 05:11:39,400
Okay, glass with glass.

6542
05:11:44,459 --> 05:11:45,659
Glass and house.

6543
05:11:50,220 --> 05:11:51,099
Oh, shit.

6544
05:11:51,099 --> 05:11:51,979
Skyscraper.

6545
05:11:51,979 --> 05:11:52,299
Perfect.

6546
05:11:52,299 --> 05:11:55,979
Alright, skyscraper and human is like office worker,

6547
05:11:55,979 --> 05:11:57,340
businessman or something, right?

6548
05:12:00,919 --> 05:12:04,869
Oh.

6549
05:12:04,869 --> 05:12:06,069
Skyscraper and house?

6550
05:12:08,439 --> 05:12:09,720
Do fertilizer in the field.

6551
05:12:09,720 --> 05:12:10,520
Oh, shit.

6552
05:12:10,520 --> 05:12:11,240
Okay, yeah.

6553
05:12:13,909 --> 05:12:14,790
What category is that in?

6554
05:12:14,790 --> 05:12:15,669
I don't fucking remember.

6555
05:12:15,669 --> 05:12:16,709
Fertilizer and field.

6556
05:12:16,709 --> 05:12:17,349
Fertilizer is...

6557
05:12:19,340 --> 05:12:20,060
I don't remember.

6558
05:12:20,060 --> 05:12:21,099
There's so many categories.

6559
05:12:21,099 --> 05:12:21,740
There's so many things.

6560
05:12:22,380 --> 05:12:23,099
Fertilizer and...

6561
05:12:23,099 --> 05:12:23,819
Where's the fertilizer?

6562
05:12:23,819 --> 05:12:25,020
Okay, fertilizer field.

6563
05:12:25,020 --> 05:12:25,659
No, shit.

6564
05:12:26,380 --> 05:12:28,229
Skyscraper and hut.

6565
05:12:30,220 --> 05:12:31,020
Field and house.

6566
05:12:31,740 --> 05:12:38,009
Concrete house.

6567
05:12:38,650 --> 05:12:40,599
Human and clothes.

6568
05:12:43,220 --> 05:12:43,720
Shit.

6569
05:12:44,500 --> 05:12:45,459
Fabric and boat.

6570
05:12:47,299 --> 05:12:48,500
Okay, fabric and boat.

6571
05:12:48,500 --> 05:12:49,139
Try this one.

6572
05:12:49,779 --> 05:12:52,790
What would fabric and boat do?

6573
05:12:54,169 --> 05:12:54,669
No.

6574
05:12:57,680 --> 05:12:58,639
Fabric and feather.

6575
05:12:59,439 --> 05:12:59,939
Okay.

6576
05:13:00,400 --> 05:13:01,919
Where the hell is the feather?

6577
05:13:02,479 --> 05:13:03,709
How many things?

6578
05:13:03,709 --> 05:13:05,310
Fucking hundred goddamn elements.

6579
05:13:06,029 --> 05:13:07,610
I just keep forgetting where everything is.

6580
05:13:07,610 --> 05:13:09,919
My brain is fucking fried.

6581
05:13:12,970 --> 05:13:13,770
Feather is...

6582
05:13:13,770 --> 05:13:14,409
Yeah, I don't know.

6583
05:13:15,049 --> 05:13:15,549
This one?

6584
05:13:16,250 --> 05:13:21,819
There it is.

6585
05:13:21,819 --> 05:13:22,619
Oh, it's in food.

6586
05:13:22,619 --> 05:13:23,500
Why is it in food?

6587
05:13:24,139 --> 05:13:27,630
Alright, bird house.

6588
05:13:31,439 --> 05:13:32,720
Shit, there's less than 10.

6589
05:13:36,139 --> 05:13:37,020
Bird house.

6590
05:13:37,020 --> 05:13:37,520
Shit.

6591
05:13:38,459 --> 05:13:39,419
Sand and egg.

6592
05:13:39,419 --> 05:13:39,919
Egg.

6593
05:13:42,479 --> 05:13:43,119
Oh, no.

6594
05:13:43,840 --> 05:13:45,119
Sand and egg.

6595
05:13:45,119 --> 05:13:45,619
Okay.

6596
05:13:49,229 --> 05:13:49,729
Turtle!

6597
05:13:51,840 --> 05:13:52,560
Yes, okay.

6598
05:13:52,560 --> 05:13:53,360
Turtle in water.

6599
05:13:55,919 --> 05:13:57,360
Turtle in swamp.

6600
05:13:58,000 --> 05:14:02,840
There's one more animal that is not here.

6601
05:14:02,840 --> 05:14:03,720
Cat and beast?

6602
05:14:05,639 --> 05:14:07,080
Do water and sand.

6603
05:14:07,080 --> 05:14:11,720
I feel like I did water and sand a while ago.

6604
05:14:12,279 --> 05:14:13,000
Didn't I?

6605
05:14:13,000 --> 05:14:14,159
No.

6606
05:14:14,159 --> 05:14:17,709
Oh, this is interesting.

6607
05:14:18,509 --> 05:14:20,909
How about ghost and bird?

6608
05:14:21,549 --> 05:14:23,709
Ghost, whale, ghost, dinosaur, ghost, beast.

6609
05:14:25,470 --> 05:14:31,419
Ghost, snake, ghost, animal, lizard, ghost, turtle, ghost, fish, ghost, zombie, bird,

6610
05:14:34,250 --> 05:14:45,159

6612
05:14:53,549 --> 05:14:56,909
freent, whale, vampire, beast.

6613
05:14:56,909 --> 05:14:57,790
Oh, Jesus.

6614
05:14:57,790 --> 05:14:58,590
Okay, there it is.

6615
05:14:59,229 --> 05:14:59,709
Werewolf.

6616
05:15:01,400 --> 05:15:02,040
Nice.

6617
05:15:02,040 --> 05:15:02,840
Nice.

6618
05:15:08,459 --> 05:15:09,340
Sand and tree.

6619
05:15:10,139 --> 05:15:14,060
No.

6620
05:15:14,060 --> 05:15:15,020
Fertilizer and tree.

6621
05:15:15,580 --> 05:15:22,490
Boat and wood.

6622
05:15:22,490 --> 05:15:23,849
Wouldn't the boat made out of wood?

6623
05:15:26,490 --> 05:15:27,770
I feel like the boat is already made out of wood.

6624
05:15:33,180 --> 05:15:33,500
Ship.

6625
05:15:34,540 --> 05:15:36,029
All right.

6626
05:15:36,029 --> 05:15:37,950
Down to the final six.

6627
05:15:37,950 --> 05:15:38,750
Only a few more.

6628
05:15:39,470 --> 05:15:43,529
Yeah, I figured boat and oil would.

6629
05:15:43,529 --> 05:15:44,409
Ship and oil?

6630
05:15:44,409 --> 05:15:44,650
No.

6631
05:15:45,290 --> 05:15:46,409
Coal and ship.

6632
05:15:46,409 --> 05:15:47,130
Fire and ship.

6633
05:15:49,080 --> 05:15:50,279
Coal and locomotive?

6634
05:15:50,279 --> 05:15:50,919
No, really.

6635
05:15:52,349 --> 05:15:53,549
Ship and steam engine.

6636
05:15:54,430 --> 05:15:54,909
Try that.

6637
05:15:57,689 --> 05:15:58,970
And there's the steam ship.

6638
05:15:58,970 --> 05:15:59,450
Perfect.

6639
05:15:59,450 --> 05:15:59,849
Five more.

6640
05:16:00,569 --> 05:16:02,110
Now I'll do ship and boiler.

6641
05:16:02,669 --> 05:16:05,020
Human and ship.

6642
05:16:05,580 --> 05:16:09,020
We'll try human and steam ship.

6643
05:16:09,020 --> 05:16:09,659
Human and ship.

6644
05:16:10,939 --> 05:16:11,740
Human and airplane.

6645
05:16:12,299 --> 05:16:16,430
What about beast and fish?

6646
05:16:16,430 --> 05:16:16,750
Cool.

6647
05:16:16,750 --> 05:16:17,229
I'll try it.

6648
05:16:22,139 --> 05:16:22,939
Dolphin.

6649
05:16:22,939 --> 05:16:23,979
There's only four more.

6650
05:16:23,979 --> 05:16:24,779
This is almost done.

6651
05:16:24,779 --> 05:16:25,500
Metal and energy.

6652
05:16:25,500 --> 05:16:26,220
That's a good try.

6653
05:16:26,939 --> 05:16:27,340
Let's see.

6654
05:16:30,139 --> 05:16:31,900
Oh, oh, it's electricity.

6655
05:16:34,750 --> 05:16:35,869
I'll do ship and fabric.

6656
05:16:36,430 --> 05:16:40,159
Okay.

6657
05:16:40,159 --> 05:16:41,279
Ship and fabric.

6658
05:16:43,389 --> 05:16:45,150
Is this a sailboat?

6659
05:16:47,979 --> 05:16:49,020
What are the last three?

6660
05:16:49,819 --> 05:16:50,779
We got all the animals.

6661
05:16:51,849 --> 05:16:53,610
All the gooey things.

6662
05:16:54,330 --> 05:16:57,130
We're missing some of the life things.

6663
05:16:58,779 --> 05:17:00,220
I feel like a little bit of fire.

6664
05:17:00,220 --> 05:17:05,580
House and domestic animal.

6665
05:17:05,580 --> 05:17:06,619
And then they wrote four.

6666
05:17:06,619 --> 05:17:07,259
Fuck's sake.

6667
05:17:07,819 --> 05:17:08,720
All right.

6668
05:17:08,720 --> 05:17:09,360
I hope you're right.

6669
05:17:09,360 --> 05:17:11,680
If you're not right, you're getting fucking timed up for 10 minutes.

6670
05:17:11,680 --> 05:17:15,470
You're getting timed up for 10 minutes if this is incorrect.

6671
05:17:15,470 --> 05:17:18,840
Okay, let's find a house.

6672
05:17:18,840 --> 05:17:20,959
Ready?

6673
05:17:20,959 --> 05:17:23,709
House and domesticated animal.

6674
05:17:23,709 --> 05:17:31,389
Oh, get him.

6675
05:17:33,150 --> 05:17:37,360
Right now he's like, no, no, you'll never take me alive.

6676
05:17:38,240 --> 05:17:40,299
Or what if he just hit the X?

6677
05:17:41,259 --> 05:17:42,569
Otto, what is it?

6678
05:17:46,639 --> 05:17:47,680
Oh shit, I'm out of here.

6679
05:17:51,240 --> 05:17:52,360
Whale and human.

6680
05:17:52,919 --> 05:17:53,959
Oh, hi, Otto.

6681
05:17:55,369 --> 05:17:56,090
Whale and human?

6682
05:17:56,650 --> 05:18:00,159
Okay.

6683
05:18:00,159 --> 05:18:05,930
Otto plus energy.

6684
05:18:06,810 --> 05:18:08,090
Fire arm and vodka.

6685
05:18:08,650 --> 05:18:10,720
Oh, we got a hidden coming up here.

6686
05:18:10,720 --> 05:18:11,040
Hold on.

6687
05:18:14,060 --> 05:18:16,189
And okay.

6688
05:18:18,000 --> 05:18:20,000
A blast thing of transportation.

6689
05:18:23,150 --> 05:18:23,950
Fish and boat.

6690
05:18:25,150 --> 05:18:25,950
Fish and ship.

6691
05:18:26,590 --> 05:18:28,159
Fish and steamship.

6692
05:18:28,159 --> 05:18:28,400
No.

6693
05:18:30,189 --> 05:18:31,150
Bird and plane.

6694
05:18:33,150 --> 05:18:34,110
Beast and cart.

6695
05:18:36,569 --> 05:18:38,009
There it is.

6696
05:18:38,009 --> 05:18:38,330
Nice.

6697
05:18:38,970 --> 05:18:41,580
This is done.

6698
05:18:42,619 --> 05:18:43,259
What's left?

6699
05:18:43,259 --> 05:18:44,540
There's only a few things left.

6700
05:18:45,099 --> 05:18:46,139
Two things left.

6701
05:18:46,139 --> 05:18:47,259
Okay, Otto, I'll take your side.

6702
05:18:47,900 --> 05:18:50,400
Otto?

6703
05:18:52,319 --> 05:18:53,439
Let me just take him off real quick.

6704
05:18:53,439 --> 05:18:54,560
I'll be right back.

6705
05:18:54,560 --> 05:18:55,759
You want to go over this way?

6706
05:18:55,759 --> 05:18:56,400
Okay.

6707
05:18:56,400 --> 05:18:57,240
I'll be right back.

6708
05:21:59,069 --> 05:21:59,630
Very cool.

6709
05:22:02,830 --> 05:22:04,189
Very, very cool.

6710
05:22:04,189 --> 05:22:07,790
Chunky fireman in real life.

6711
05:22:08,349 --> 05:22:14,810
I'll hit.

6712
05:22:14,810 --> 05:22:16,750
Very cool.

6713
05:22:16,750 --> 05:22:20,279
There was a hundred gifted subs.

6714
05:22:20,279 --> 05:22:21,080
Wait, what?

6715
05:22:21,080 --> 05:22:21,560
Hold on.

6716
05:22:22,119 --> 05:22:30,970
Let me see.

6717
05:22:30,970 --> 05:22:31,770
What are you talking about?

6718
05:22:32,990 --> 05:22:33,630
Oh my god.

6719
05:22:33,630 --> 05:22:34,909
There was a hundred subs.

6720
05:22:34,909 --> 05:22:36,720
What the fuck?

6721
05:22:36,720 --> 05:22:37,599
What the fuck?

6722
05:22:38,970 --> 05:22:40,169
That's too many.

6723
05:22:40,169 --> 05:22:41,130
That's too many.

6724
05:22:42,009 --> 05:22:43,689
That's from ZapX.

6725
05:22:43,689 --> 05:22:46,090
There's a hundred community subs.

6726
05:22:46,090 --> 05:22:47,979
I thought you guys were debating for a second.

6727
05:22:47,979 --> 05:22:49,180
I was like, oh my god.

6728
05:22:49,740 --> 05:22:55,720
I feel like you've done this before.

6729
05:22:58,110 --> 05:22:58,990
That's too many.

6730
05:23:01,880 --> 05:23:03,080
I really appreciate it though.

6731
05:23:03,080 --> 05:23:03,639
Thank you.

6732
05:23:03,639 --> 05:23:06,040
That's a monster amount of money.

6733
05:23:10,400 --> 05:23:10,799
Thank you.

6734
05:23:15,319 --> 05:23:15,639
Thank you.

6735
05:23:15,639 --> 05:23:15,959
Thank you.

6736
05:23:15,959 --> 05:23:17,599
Thank you.

6737
05:23:17,599 --> 05:23:18,400
Way more.

6738
05:23:18,400 --> 05:23:20,000
It's way more than I deserve.

6739
05:23:20,799 --> 05:23:21,919
So what is that?

6740
05:23:23,520 --> 05:23:29,979
Oh, bust of an E-clown.

6741
05:23:33,869 --> 05:23:34,189
Okay.

6742
05:23:34,189 --> 05:23:34,909
Let's stop there.

6743
05:23:34,909 --> 05:23:35,790
Let's head back over here.

6744
05:23:35,790 --> 05:23:39,979
We have only two more elements and I have a hint.

6745
05:23:45,340 --> 05:23:46,139
Water scorpion?

6746
05:23:48,509 --> 05:23:49,310
Water moss?

6747
05:23:49,310 --> 05:23:50,270
Water bacteria?

6748
05:23:50,909 --> 05:23:51,150
No.

6749
05:23:52,110 --> 05:23:53,340
What's the last one?

6750
05:23:56,810 --> 05:23:58,250
Water mushroom?

6751
05:23:58,250 --> 05:23:58,889
Water shell?

6752
05:24:00,650 --> 05:24:01,529
Butterfly water?

6753
05:24:02,169 --> 05:24:03,049
Swamp butterfly?

6754
05:24:03,849 --> 05:24:05,319
Water beetle?

6755
05:24:05,959 --> 05:24:06,439
No.

6756
05:24:06,439 --> 05:24:07,560
Water swamp?

6757
05:24:07,560 --> 05:24:08,200
Beetle swamp?

6758
05:24:09,639 --> 05:24:10,840
Alcohol and worm?

6759
05:24:10,840 --> 05:24:12,040
Yeah, I tried that one already.

6760
05:24:14,189 --> 05:24:14,990
Weed swamp?

6761
05:24:15,709 --> 05:24:16,889
No, I did that already.

6762
05:24:23,119 --> 05:24:23,919
I don't know.

6763
05:24:23,919 --> 05:24:24,400
What is it?

6764
05:24:25,040 --> 05:24:27,799
Mushroom and vodka?

6765
05:24:28,599 --> 05:24:31,840
Water and...

6766
05:24:33,630 --> 05:24:36,029
Is it alcohol?

6767
05:24:36,029 --> 05:24:36,990
Has to be something weird.

6768
05:24:45,290 --> 05:24:46,729
Vodka and beetle?

6769
05:24:51,319 --> 05:24:52,360
Moss and swamp.

6770
05:24:54,439 --> 05:24:54,919
Urn.

6771
05:24:55,560 --> 05:24:56,439
There's only one more.

6772
05:24:56,439 --> 05:24:57,159
What's the last one?

6773
05:24:57,880 --> 05:25:01,770
What's the last one?

6774
05:25:04,380 --> 05:25:08,380
Urn and something?

6775
05:25:08,380 --> 05:25:09,259
Fabric and ship.

6776
05:25:09,259 --> 05:25:09,979
Fabric and ship.

6777
05:25:09,979 --> 05:25:10,779
Yeah, I did...

6778
05:25:10,779 --> 05:25:12,220
Yeah, I got the sailboat.

6779
05:25:16,400 --> 05:25:17,520
Is it water and metal?

6780
05:25:17,520 --> 05:25:19,279
That can't be the last one that I didn't do.

6781
05:25:20,000 --> 05:25:23,740
No way.

6782
05:25:23,740 --> 05:25:23,979
Okay.

6783
05:25:24,540 --> 05:25:27,869
Do zombie and wizard.

6784
05:25:37,500 --> 05:25:38,459
Vampire wizard?

6785
05:25:39,849 --> 05:25:40,650
Ghost wizard?

6786
05:25:41,529 --> 05:25:41,930
Zombie...

6787
05:25:42,569 --> 05:25:44,060
I don't know.

6788
05:25:44,060 --> 05:25:49,360
Vodka plus firearm.

6789
05:25:49,360 --> 05:25:50,159
Oh, okay.

6790
05:25:56,299 --> 05:25:57,340
Zombie and corpse.

6791
05:26:03,200 --> 05:26:03,599
Is it?

6792
05:26:06,700 --> 05:26:07,979
Oh, there it is!

6793
05:26:09,610 --> 05:26:10,650
That's the end of the game.

6794
05:26:12,729 --> 05:26:13,130
Ghoul.

6795
05:26:14,009 --> 05:26:14,970
Congratulations.

6796
05:26:16,159 --> 05:26:17,439
In the next episodes,

6797
05:26:17,439 --> 05:26:19,919
which path will the development of the world creation take?

6798
05:26:19,919 --> 05:26:21,919
What other fantastic adventures will Doodle God make?

6799
05:26:22,560 --> 05:26:26,540
Maybe technological disaster will throw the world into stone age.

6800
05:26:26,540 --> 05:26:28,060
What creatures will inhabit the planet?

6801
05:26:28,060 --> 05:26:31,500
Or maybe world will take the path of magic.

6802
05:26:32,139 --> 05:26:34,560
Perhaps the Doodle God himself will descend from heavens

6803
05:26:35,200 --> 05:26:36,720
and take on adventures personally.

6804
05:26:38,990 --> 05:26:40,750
You can now play it on your iPhone, by the way.

6805
05:26:43,869 --> 05:26:45,790
There are like five of these.

6806
05:26:48,720 --> 05:26:49,919
Yeah, there's like Doodle Devil,

6807
05:26:49,919 --> 05:26:52,959
this is Doodle Medieval, Doodle Doodle Magic or something, right?

6808
05:26:53,759 --> 05:26:56,830
That was fun.

6809
05:26:56,830 --> 05:26:57,310
That was fun.

6810
05:26:57,310 --> 05:26:58,509
That was very chill and just...

6811
05:26:58,509 --> 05:26:59,790
That was really fun just to hang out.

6812
05:27:04,619 --> 05:27:12,959
Okay, I promise everybody that I will play Nitrome this week, okay?

6813
05:27:12,959 --> 05:27:15,799
We'll go back to it.

6814
05:27:15,799 --> 05:27:18,909
But I am going to call it here.

6815
05:27:18,909 --> 05:27:20,430
It's been five and a half hours.

6816
05:27:20,430 --> 05:27:21,470
It hasn't really felt that long.

6817
05:27:22,110 --> 05:27:28,560
I'll see you guys tomorrow for the game awards.

6818
05:27:29,200 --> 05:27:32,479
Stream will be starting somewhere around like 3 15.

6819
05:27:33,279 --> 05:27:35,119
We'll hang out for like 15 minutes before it starts.

6820
05:27:35,680 --> 05:27:38,110
We'll do that.

6821
05:27:38,110 --> 05:27:41,479
And then we'll see what's going on on Friday.

6822
05:27:41,479 --> 05:27:45,880
But I'll see you guys tomorrow.

6823
05:27:45,880 --> 05:27:48,319
Yeah, game awards are tomorrow.

6824
05:27:48,319 --> 05:27:50,720
I'm only watching the game awards for Elden Ring.

6825
05:27:50,720 --> 05:27:52,159
I don't care about anything else.

6826
05:27:52,159 --> 05:27:54,169
I'm just going to sleep through it until...

6827
05:27:54,169 --> 05:27:57,130
I have like an alert on my phone when the announcement is coming.

6828
05:27:57,130 --> 05:28:03,520
There's probably some other cool reveals too.

6829
05:28:03,520 --> 05:28:04,000
There might be.

6830
05:28:04,000 --> 05:28:08,009
We'll see.

6831
05:28:08,009 --> 05:28:09,689
That's going to conclude tonight's stream.

6832
05:28:09,689 --> 05:28:10,490
Thanks for watching, guys.

6833
05:28:10,490 --> 05:28:11,689
Sorry I was gone for so long.

6834
05:28:13,479 --> 05:28:15,080
I just wasn't able to talk.

6835
05:28:15,159 --> 05:28:17,560
It really took until about this morning

6836
05:28:17,560 --> 05:28:20,599
before I felt comfortable speaking for more than like an hour straight.

6837
05:28:20,599 --> 05:28:23,439
So we unban that guy?

6838
05:28:23,439 --> 05:28:25,119
That guy should be unbanned by now, right?

6839
05:28:25,119 --> 05:28:32,880
Send him a DM like and just say, hey, you got noticed.

6840
05:28:34,750 --> 05:28:36,349
No, he's still banned.

6841
05:28:36,349 --> 05:28:37,689
He's still banned.

6842
05:28:46,400 --> 05:28:47,200
Well, okay.

6843
05:28:47,200 --> 05:28:52,909
Maybe he'll be unbanned tomorrow.

6844
05:28:52,909 --> 05:28:53,470
All right.

6845
05:28:53,470 --> 05:29:02,060
So raid, raid.

6846
05:29:02,060 --> 05:29:02,540
Okay.

6847
05:29:02,540 --> 05:29:02,939
Raid.

6848
05:29:02,939 --> 05:29:03,340
You want...

6849
05:29:03,979 --> 05:29:04,700
Is Dunkey...

6850
05:29:04,700 --> 05:29:05,819
Dunkey is streaming now, right?

6851
05:29:06,459 --> 05:29:07,979
But I'm such like a fan.

6852
05:29:07,979 --> 05:29:09,180
Like if I stream...

6853
05:29:09,180 --> 05:29:10,540
If I raid Dunkey...

6854
05:29:10,860 --> 05:29:12,939
I could be like, oh, it's Dunkey.

6855
05:29:12,939 --> 05:29:13,659
I'm such a big fan.

6856
05:29:13,659 --> 05:29:14,860
And here's like a bunch of people.

6857
05:29:24,169 --> 05:29:25,610
Yeah, Dunkey's really funny.

6858
05:29:25,610 --> 05:29:26,889
He's been around for a long time.

6859
05:29:26,889 --> 05:29:29,529
If you don't know who he is, he's very, very funny.

6860
05:29:29,529 --> 05:29:32,509
He's got some of the funniest YouTube videos I've ever watched.

6861
05:29:33,069 --> 05:29:35,400
One of my favorites is the capture video.

6862
05:29:35,400 --> 05:29:37,159
If you haven't seen it, please give yourself a treat

6863
05:29:37,159 --> 05:29:39,720
and go watch it right now before you, you know, watch the stream.

6864
05:29:39,720 --> 05:29:43,319
We're going to raid Dunkey.

6865
05:29:43,319 --> 05:29:45,560
Look, I'm just a fan.

6866
05:29:45,560 --> 05:29:46,200
Whatever.

6867
05:29:46,200 --> 05:29:46,599
He's cool.

6868
05:29:46,599 --> 05:29:47,159
Whatever.

6869
05:29:47,159 --> 05:29:51,479
What is this?

6870
05:29:51,479 --> 05:29:52,520
I got to follow him on Twitch.

6871
05:29:52,520 --> 05:29:53,720
What is his Twitch name?

6872
05:29:53,720 --> 05:29:59,770
I got to follow him right now.

6873
05:29:59,770 --> 05:30:02,360
Dunkstream.

6874
05:30:02,360 --> 05:30:02,919
Oh, yeah.

6875
05:30:02,919 --> 05:30:08,459
He's had this account for a long time, hasn't he?

6876
05:30:08,459 --> 05:30:08,700
All right.

6877
05:30:08,700 --> 05:30:09,900
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

6878
05:30:09,900 --> 05:30:11,419
Have a good one.

6879
05:30:11,419 --> 05:30:11,900
Take care.

6880
05:30:11,900 --> 05:30:12,459
Good night.

6881
05:30:12,459 --> 05:30:13,099
Goodbye.

6882
05:30:13,099 --> 05:30:15,240
See you tomorrow for the game awards.

6883
05:30:15,240 --> 05:30:16,599
Goodbye.

6884
05:30:16,599 --> 05:30:20,430
Get that raid going.

6885
05:30:21,610 --> 05:30:28,240
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

6886
05:30:28,240 --> 05:30:29,439
I'm looking forward to the game awards.

6887
05:30:29,439 --> 05:30:31,720
I think it's going to be some cool stuff there.

6888
05:30:31,720 --> 05:30:32,279
I don't know.

6889
05:30:32,279 --> 05:30:33,240
We'll see.

6890
05:30:33,240 --> 05:30:36,959
Good night, guys.

6891
05:30:36,959 --> 05:30:38,319
Thanks for watching, as always.

6892
05:30:38,319 --> 05:30:40,779
See you soon.
