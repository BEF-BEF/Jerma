1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:12,300
Late. I actually just walked in here, just moving some stuff around. I went to the bathroom

2
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,019
and saw the time. I saw it was 3 59 and I said, oh fuck, and I pressed the button.

3
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:34,100
I ain't even fucking ready, but I'm gonna press it. That was an awful little laugh. What are you

4
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:40,439
talking about? You've been doing this all week. Hey, I was live at 11 15 yesterday.

5
00:00:41,079 --> 00:01:02,179
The window was 11 to 12 yesterday and I was there at 11 15. Right? Yeah, but that was

6
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:11,430
yesterday. This is today. The one time you're early. There's no, look, there is no early or

7
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:18,310
late anymore. There is between three and four. That's it. Might start at three. Might start at

8
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:24,250
four. Just gives me that window so it doesn't matter. Usually though, all jokes aside,

9
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:31,799
usually though, if you look back at the last like three or four weeks, it's usually been

10
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:41,260
like 3 40, like 350. So between three and four p.m. has averaged out somehow to like 3 45,

11
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:51,560
like 3 40 and 3 50. Well, that's the design. That's what it's there for.

12
00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:00,329
Just make it 3 30 to 4 30. No, because no, no, I can't do that. Because look,

13
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:07,769
the whole point of this whole thing was to make sure that I didn't start after four.

14
00:02:08,409 --> 00:02:11,530
You know what I mean? Because like if I got a three to four hour window, like what, are you

15
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:18,490
kidding me? Making it 3 30 to 4 30 is then like, oh, I got it till 4 30 now. No, no, no, no,

16
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:23,930
no. It's to make sure that I like get fucking ready and get here between three and four.

17
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:33,020
The more you push that window forward, the more it's like, wow, 5 30. All right, fine. I'll

18
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:50,139
start at 5 22. But anyways, how you doing? Make it within a 24 hour range. Well, the idea

19
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:57,939
was that, okay, I got rid of the schedule, right? So no, it is not like, oh, Tuesday, Thursday,

20
00:02:57,939 --> 00:03:02,819
Friday, and that's it. It's, we'll just do whatever. Getting rid of the time schedule

21
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:07,939
was also part of the plan, but I didn't want to do that. So I kept it at like the three to

22
00:03:07,939 --> 00:03:15,860
fourish sort of range because I don't want to just have it be, oh yeah, he's going to be

23
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:22,889
live at some point at some time. That doesn't make any sense. Why would I do that? All right,

24
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:30,060
guys, I'll see you streams over for today. I'll see you guys at some point at some time.

25
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:36,650
You mean tomorrow? I don't know. You mean what? You mean like this week? Yeah. Oh yeah. I'll

26
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:40,539
stream at some point this week, but at some time, it's like, it's like sitting there

27
00:03:40,539 --> 00:03:49,530
waiting at the telephone. Is he going to call? Hey, that's like, can I get your number? Yeah,

28
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:54,680
yeah, sure. I'll give you my number. What's your number? Thank you. Thank you. What do you

29
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,580
want to like, when do you think he'll call? At some point at some time. Don't do that to

30
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:10,120
me. Tell me if you're going to call me tomorrow. Anyways, let's move on. Today is going to be Sam

31
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:23,509
and Max season two. I'm going to start, he's ghosting his chat. I've never done that.

32
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:30,519
Actually, well, I have maybe a few times, but we're going to do season two, episode one

33
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:39,910
of Sam and Max. Can you, could you already tell that will there be anything else than

34
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:46,889
Sam and Max? So I, I know. No, Sam, we're just going to do probably the first two episodes of

35
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:54,139
Sam and Max tonight. And then tomorrow, that's right, four days in a row. Tell him to get rid

36
00:04:54,139 --> 00:05:02,329
of that schedule. And I have unleashed. You see, you see, it's the same thing.

37
00:05:02,329 --> 00:05:06,649
Look, look, look. I know. Oops. I'm sorry. I know people are going to be like, I know,

38
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:13,779
I know we get it. Just go. But listen, removing the schedule. It's the same idea of

39
00:05:13,779 --> 00:05:20,360
having the window there, right? Or giving like a perfect time. Cause if I have a three

40
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:25,370
day a week schedule, I'm only going to stream three days a week, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday.

41
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:31,560
That's it. Okay. Bye. I don't have to worry about anything. Just that's it.

42
00:05:32,649 --> 00:05:35,209
See now I can, whenever I feel like it, we can just fucking keep going.

43
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:45,430
I can, I could go three, four, five straight days, whatever. Keep talking to us. No,

44
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,790
with no schedule, you can stream less. Oh, that's true, but that's not the case.

45
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:54,649
All right. If that was the case, is he mad? No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait, mad.

46
00:05:54,649 --> 00:05:57,930
No, no, no, no. I'm just trying to give some more insight. It's some more lore for

47
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:05,610
the Wiki page. Keep stalling. All right. You think I'm stalling? It's already ready to go.

48
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:16,680
Bang. Game paused. Press space. All I have to do is press space. Oh,

49
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,160
fucking set. Who set him off? No, no, no. I'm not. I'm just, nobody set me off. Don't

50
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:31,850
worry. See, it's right there. I can just press it. That's a screenshot. Oh yeah. You

51
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:40,899
think that's a screenshot? Is it now, huh? What you guys don't know is I animated all

52
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:49,610
this in dreams. That's not a video. Hold on. Let me just tweet this. All right. Too long,

53
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:56,060
too long streamer stalling for fucking 10 minutes before we do anything. No schedule,

54
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:00,699
no timeframe means I stream more. I need to get more of me. I don't know if you want

55
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:03,259
that or not. Maybe you don't want that. Maybe you're like, dude, we liked it when you were

56
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:17,079
less. Get the fuck out of here. Called dentist waiting room. All right. Here we go. Season

57
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:22,740
one, uh, season two. Sorry, I'm saying Max, but I didn't even get a chance to ask you

58
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:27,990
guys how has your day been going? That's the ultimate stall question.

59
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:42,519
Because I'm talking, okay, I'm typing right now a tweet saying that I'm live. Hey,

60
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:46,279
and so by the way, how has your day been? Let's go ahead. Give me some answers here.

61
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,589
All right. Season two.

62
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:09,939
All right. Now it's official. I gotta go. Season two, episode one, Sam and Max.

63
00:08:11,019 --> 00:08:17,500
Let's see what the intro is doing for us today. Congratulations on another successful

64
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:23,740
peace summit, Mr. President. Don't congratulate me. Congratulate the peacemaker. You crack me

65
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:28,779
up a little brain salad. Oh, that was, he just, he's been acting surly and withdrawn

66
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:32,460
even for a vice president, but I never thought it would come to this.

67
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:38,779
His lust for power has twisted him into a mockery of the goldfish. We once kind of loved

68
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:45,100
that in sushi and fin flapping that glassy malevolent stare like a sociopath or a Fox

69
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:52,940
newscaster. Mr. Spatula has become pure evil. Why would he do staging a spatula? Not on my

70
00:08:52,940 --> 00:09:02,649
watch. Eliminate him. You are my idol. I didn't. Why did they do that?

71
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:10,090
Hi fellas. Hey, what's the rumpus? I'm in the middle of some sensitive PI business.

72
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:13,690
And we respect your sensitivity. Is that mechanical goon one of yours?

73
00:09:16,169 --> 00:09:18,889
Secret sideburns of Isaac Asimov. My name Tron.

74
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:31,509
That's what Mr. Spatula gets for sending a hitman with lousy aim.

75
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:35,110
Max, what say we go down and administer a freelance police style beat down to that

76
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:40,389
metal monstrosity? And then dance on its smoking carcass. It's that attention to detail that

77
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:52,230
makes me glad you're still president, little buddy. Sorry, I had to, I had something, I had to

78
00:09:52,230 --> 00:10:00,490
talk to you real quick. All right, so first of all, this is important. I need to make sure

79
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:08,009
this is in the right settings. Are these right? Wait, is it, is Cox coming back? Help not.

80
00:10:09,929 --> 00:10:15,480
I think this is fine. I had to do this because I couldn't do full screen,

81
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:23,080
because full screen wasn't gonna work. Top titles are on, hint level. They added this

82
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:30,139
in season two. I can't turn this on, right? People would make fun of me. I think we're

83
00:10:30,139 --> 00:10:36,230
good. All right, let's go see what this thing's doing. He's tearing apart the entire

84
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:47,190
building. That's fucking kind of loud though. Hold on, that's the thing. We're not dropping frames,

85
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:58,700
right? We better not be. All right, what do you say? Hello? We didn't see you at all last year,

86
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:04,460
Flint. What gives? Okay, that was weird. I had one hell of a crazy case, fellas.

87
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:10,220
Boiling a conspiracy in the movie biz, matching wits with a reanimated Grover Cleveland,

88
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:15,019
breaking up Ascension's cell phone network, and a showdown with a cult leader on Saturn's

89
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:21,240
sergeant moon. It's wall dead. Wow, come we never get to do cool stuff like that.

90
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:29,320
That really is wall dead. All right, so I don't have, what do I have? Gun? Shoot robot with

91
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:37,820
gun. Not even a gun. They just don't make bullets like they used to. Wall dead. He's

92
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:53,539
tearing apart the entire building. He's tearing apart the entire building. I'm worried, Max.

93
00:11:53,539 --> 00:11:56,580
Worried that enormous black mole on your back might be malignant?

94
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:01,460
Well, I am now. I was just worried that the giant robot was going to tear down our building.

95
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:11,080
Can you hear me? Okay, the button's fucked up. How are things going with your presidency?

96
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:16,200
The winds of progress are blowing swift and juicy, Sam. I'm proudest of the new law I

97
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:21,639
just pushed through congress. I'm pretty sure he who smelt it dealt it was already established

98
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:28,299
during the Eisenhower administration, little pal. I enjoy our little chats. Anything for a

99
00:12:28,299 --> 00:12:34,490
friend and registered voter. I'm excited for season fucking two. What's this? We should just

100
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:39,610
accept we'll never teach that chief to be an arts grand master. How do I stop a robot from

101
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:43,210
punching me? Banana peels are a lot better than what he used to fling at it.

102
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:50,759
All right, this is really loud. Like, too loud for comfort. We can't do anything out here.

103
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:53,159
He's tearing apart. Should we leave? Should we just leave?

104
00:13:02,299 --> 00:13:10,730
What goes up must come down. The boss goes back. Just to tell you once again who's back.

105
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,799
He may be a mechanized engine of wanton destruction, but his taste in hideous

106
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:28,629
middle of the road pop music is impeccable dead. No, they wouldn't kill a main character like that.

107
00:13:29,429 --> 00:13:34,539
I don't believe it for a second. All right, so he's lost that loving feeling.

108
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,820
Excuse me, Mr. ginormous wind up toy of destruction.

109
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,740
Yes, I don't suppose you care to start. What do you want?

110
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:53,399
Hmm. In truth, it does not matter. I exist only as a mechanized engine for destruction.

111
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:57,159
What I do is what I am, whether I care for it or not.

112
00:13:57,159 --> 00:14:01,399
Oh, no, Sam, he's been to community college. It's trouble. All right.

113
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:10,169
All right, so we're not I have a question. You seem like a smart guy for a robot.

114
00:14:10,169 --> 00:14:14,009
Can you explain something to us? There is no question you could have

115
00:14:14,009 --> 00:14:19,769
that I could not answer immediately. Okay. No, no, no, no. Put that away.

116
00:14:20,889 --> 00:14:25,929
Max, you're always screwing things up. God, I love them. Why are you doing this? What if all

117
00:14:25,929 --> 00:14:30,889
this is an illusion? Why do fools fall in love? He's having love. He's saying stuff about

118
00:14:30,889 --> 00:14:36,889
love. Let's ask him that. Why do fools fall in love? Why do birds sing so gay and lovers

119
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:41,529
await the break of day? All right. Well, that stopped him from doing something from

120
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:46,490
attacking the building. I wonder what that means now. Maybe we come back and we

121
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:53,179
throw a grenade at him. I don't know. We're going to go to Bosco's. He's selling a

122
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,370
limb tear off device and it turns out as a grenade. The car's fucked up.

123
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:05,370
I've spent too many cycles processing this query. I might as well face it. I'm addicted

124
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:11,620
to show. So that stops him. I don't think I can do anything else.

125
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:19,620
Excuse me, Mr. Manedron. He didn't go high enough. He should have went.

126
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:28,620
All right. Let's do again. I have a question. I want to ask you something. Why do birds

127
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:32,700
appear every time you're near? What if all this is an illusion? Why do birds

128
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:37,019
appear every time you're near? Why do birds suddenly appear every time you are near?

129
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:45,340
Do that. Fascinating. All right. You get him to start thinking and then.

130
00:15:49,539 --> 00:15:59,700
Wait, hold on. The robot sounds like Kylo Ren. I seem to get to turn him off. Reach

131
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:10,200
out the window and turn off his thing. Pull the key up. Oh, you were trying to

132
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:15,879
destroy us and worse. You butchered every song I wish I'd forgotten. And another one

133
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:22,600
bites. And another one bites. And another one bites. I didn't kill him.

134
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:38,379
I didn't kill him. He's alive. Check the closet. Oh, that's from season one. Here's

135
00:16:38,379 --> 00:16:45,860
the Whack the Rats bulletin board. Cool. Pardoned. Have you been abusing your

136
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:49,940
presidential powers again, Max? He's not. That depends on what your definition of

137
00:16:50,019 --> 00:17:01,659
abuse is. He's not dead. He has a wind-up toy in his back. He cannot die. He cannot

138
00:17:01,659 --> 00:17:09,299
die. He cannot live. He can merely exist. And I know what you're saying. Oh, hey,

139
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:12,740
Jeremy. What about your fucking body's electrolytes? That's the same exact

140
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:18,819
thing as pulling the key out. No, it's not. So he's just. Who is he fighting?

141
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:27,740
What's he doing in here? I'm surprised this game survived being thrown clear

142
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:32,460
at the Playland and Casino explosion. Nobody's saying that. Yeah, they are.

143
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:46,170
You're thinking it. I forget which. It's the orange. Okay, it's the orange one. I

144
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:53,210
didn't know. I forgot. I'll get that better. Hold on. Do it again. I don't

145
00:17:53,210 --> 00:18:15,240
lose. I don't. I never lose. Don't say that. I don't lose. I don't lose.

146
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:26,259
Don't ever say that to me again. I don't ever lose. It's our Salvia

147
00:18:26,259 --> 00:18:30,339
Hispanic of Brady culture here. Safe and fun gardening at home with no

148
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:33,619
threat of legal action due to trademark infringement.

149
00:18:33,619 --> 00:18:38,099
Oh, okay. All right, let's go check on the robot.

150
00:18:38,099 --> 00:18:43,450
We pressed a few buttons. Not bad, kid.

151
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:52,549
Question, Sam. How do you like me now, spatula?

152
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:55,829
I'll ignore that question, Max, in order to say, look,

153
00:18:55,829 --> 00:18:59,509
holy knuckle cracking cringles on a bullet train with a sack full of head-covered cheese.

154
00:18:59,509 --> 00:19:02,230
I wish Jerma played Joffrey in Game of Thrones.

155
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:06,069
We were wrong about Mr. Spatula all along. What do you mean

156
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:09,109
why?

157
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:14,789
It was sent from a bleak and desolate wasteland by the most ancient and

158
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:20,789
powerful opponent we've ever faced. A hairy, bloated, pagan god.

159
00:19:20,789 --> 00:19:25,829
To Sam and Max from Santa. Why is, why would Santa be sending us, um...

160
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:34,470
Dun-unh, dun-unh, dun-unh, dun-unh-unh. Dun-unh, dun-unh, dun-unh, dun-unh-unh.

161
00:19:34,470 --> 00:20:00,579
Dun-unh, dun-unh, dun-unh, dun-unh-unh. Dun-unh, dun-unh, dun-unh, dun-unh.

162
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:05,079
I missed my cue. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

163
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:09,400
Goodbye, Santa. Leave the talking to me. And the hasty trial, the harsh

164
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,640
sentencing, and the immediate execution. I took a bite out of a sandwich.

165
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,640
God damn it. Don't I get to do anything?

166
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:24,170
Don't, I can't restart it. God damn, that was a perfect opportunity.

167
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:29,049
I don't know. I took a bite out of my sandwich. I have a sandwich over here.

168
00:20:29,049 --> 00:20:33,529
Hold on. I was gonna, I was gonna go like this.

169
00:20:33,529 --> 00:20:37,589
It's too late now, but just add it. Add it.

170
00:20:37,589 --> 00:20:39,829
Somebody add it to the end of that. I know someone's gonna fucking clip it

171
00:20:39,829 --> 00:20:55,619
or something, but add this. Oh, hey look, Max. It's the soda

172
00:20:55,619 --> 00:20:58,099
poppers. Again. We thought you'd all gotten

173
00:20:58,099 --> 00:21:00,500
taken out in the Great Dakotan Conflict.

174
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,940
You might be relieved to see we made it. Right.

175
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:09,220
Relieved. What are you doing here? We all got terrible presents from Santa.

176
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:12,819
So we decided to come to the North Pole and return them.

177
00:21:12,819 --> 00:21:16,099
Better that than spending Christmas Eve with a shotgun aimed at the

178
00:21:16,099 --> 00:21:19,460
fireplace. Kids today have no respect for

179
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:22,259
tradition, Sam. Yeah, these, these guys again.

180
00:21:22,259 --> 00:21:28,599
Why don't you go inside? We were on our way in when we heard some

181
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,720
frightening noises. That's the end of the Cowboy Bebop intro.

182
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,400
It almost sounded like. I thought you guys liked that shit.

183
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:40,119
Yeah. I'll write it down. Why am I the only one who associates Christmas with

184
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:49,609
the sound of gunfire? Best not to think about it, Max.

185
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:52,410
Uh yeah, weren't they governors? Aren't you guys governors of the Dakotas?

186
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:58,730
We were, but that wasn't enough. So we annexed Nebraska. Unfortunately, there

187
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:03,450
was a bit of a disagreement. With who? 2.5 million

188
00:22:03,529 --> 00:22:09,420
voters. They won. Are you going to run for reelection?

189
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:15,259
No, now we're focused on environmental issues. We've got a new respect for

190
00:22:15,259 --> 00:22:18,619
nature since we got kicked out of the governor's mansion.

191
00:22:18,619 --> 00:22:24,630
Can we stay with you guys? No. Are they?

192
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:28,250
Okay. Well, what did you get from Santa? What did you get from Santa?

193
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:32,250
A jar full of rhinoceros musk. Yes, another one.

194
00:22:32,329 --> 00:22:37,289
I got a see-through 90. It's beautiful, but I don't have the hips for it.

195
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:40,329
I'll trade you. Why? What did you get?

196
00:22:40,329 --> 00:22:45,059
Tuberculosis. That's what I gave Sam last year.

197
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:48,819
Don't do it. And that's why we no longer have secret Santa at the

198
00:22:48,819 --> 00:22:51,539
office. Don't fucking do it. I know some of

199
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:57,339
you guys don't. You dare. Okay. We should be going. Christmas

200
00:22:57,339 --> 00:23:01,740
isn't going to save itself. Yeah, not like that snobby self-sufficient

201
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:10,019
St. Patrick's Day. All right, so we gotta go

202
00:23:10,019 --> 00:23:13,220
Santa's Workshop, the second happiest place on Earth. The first

203
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:20,980
happiest place in the Disney world. He's really let himself go.

204
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:24,900
I should make a snowman on stream. I can't do that.

205
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,099
I live in the desert. Oh, I forgot I don't live

206
00:23:28,099 --> 00:23:38,869
in Massachusetts anymore. I can't do that. Never mind. Wait, what's this?

207
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:46,460
Yellow snow reclamation. Just make a sandman.

208
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:50,299
Bleaches it into fresh sanitary snow. Want to have a snowball fight?

209
00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:54,180
Not without industrial goggles, I don't.

210
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:58,339
What do I do? Okay, I have a snowball. This is a pea snowball.

211
00:23:58,339 --> 00:24:07,059
I throw it. He gonna throw this in his face? Hey, wizard.

212
00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:10,660
Please forgive us for what we are about to do. Oh, crap.

213
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:14,819
You guys are gonna kill me, aren't you? Yeah, we're gonna kill you.

214
00:24:14,819 --> 00:24:21,049
You need to relax. Take a deep breath. Put your guard down.

215
00:24:21,049 --> 00:24:26,009
I don't know why I'm so tense all the time.

216
00:24:26,009 --> 00:24:30,819
All right, let me tell you something. That sucked. You ever been hit in the

217
00:24:30,819 --> 00:24:33,299
face by a snowball before? It's not fun.

218
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:39,259
Of the smell of snowballs in the morning.

219
00:24:39,259 --> 00:24:45,299
It really, really fucking hurts and it's like this equal parts

220
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:49,299
numb, pain, cold. It goes down your neck into your shirt and

221
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:59,910
it's awful. All right, well, I have a snowball here

222
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:03,029
and it really depends on the snow too. You can get

223
00:25:03,029 --> 00:25:08,230
packed up really, really wet snow and it's like getting punched in the face

224
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:11,430
by a fist. People don't realize that shit.

225
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:18,970
Mostly. Not him, Santa. He forced us to make all those awful hurtful toys.

226
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:24,250
We don't know what's gotten into him. Whoa.

227
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:29,609
The snow will turn red with the blood of the knot.

228
00:25:29,609 --> 00:25:36,500
The cartoons always made him seem a lot more jolly.

229
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:40,339
If you have wet snow and you pack it up and throw a snowball at somebody,

230
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:43,220
you are throwing a baseball at them and then it's like it's all fun and

231
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:46,099
games. Would you throw a baseball at your

232
00:25:46,099 --> 00:25:50,549
friend's face as hard as you can? Why would you do that with a snowball?

233
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,670
It's not, it's fake. It's made out of like fluffy water.

234
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:58,660
No, no, no. It's a baseball you're throwing at your friend's head.

235
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:02,500
We're trying to talk to Santa. You know him? Mind if I keep cowering?

236
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:06,180
I'd encourage it. Just remember to cower with your legs,

237
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:12,230
not your back. The evidence melts away.

238
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:23,240
Whoa. I would, I would track that guy. Okay, uh, see anything unusual?

239
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,839
Well, this morning I could have sworn I felt the presence

240
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,759
of an unspeakable evil. Tell us more about this.

241
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:34,839
That doesn't even look like me. Give me a break. I'd rather not speak about it.

242
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:42,779
My teeth are way better. You all know that.

243
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:46,140
All right, so unspeakable evil. Can't you tell us anything about that

244
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:53,289
unspeakable evil? No. Don't you know what unspeakable means?

245
00:26:53,289 --> 00:26:56,650
Okay, what's, what is he doing? Why is he doing this? Santa went nuts.

246
00:26:56,650 --> 00:27:01,130
Beat me? I'm the intern. I just came off the assembly line yesterday.

247
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:04,890
Jumping jacks and half stacks of hat racks. Are you saying elves are made in

248
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:07,769
factories? Because if you are, I want to place an

249
00:27:07,769 --> 00:27:11,609
order for six million. Also, tell my army they're fired.

250
00:27:11,609 --> 00:27:16,250
No, I meant I was working in a factory. Sorry, it's relevant at the moment.

251
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:24,819
What did the factory make? Elves. Okay. Merry Christmas.

252
00:27:24,819 --> 00:27:29,539
It sure is. So the snowball melts. Should I throw a snowball in the elf's face?

253
00:27:29,539 --> 00:27:32,819
Or should I compact up a baseball snowball, throw it into the window, and

254
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:39,079
hit Santa right in the mouth? Okay, we got a lot of things to look at

255
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:46,329
here. Hold on. Trampoline. Max, get on the trampoline.

256
00:27:46,329 --> 00:27:53,769
We do? Not really. All right. We've got better things to do than jump

257
00:27:53,769 --> 00:27:59,670
around on a trampoline. Okay, so the gift dispenser. This tube

258
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:03,430
spits out presents. Hey, it's just like me. I wouldn't

259
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:06,390
call those presents, Max. It's a high score. I can put it with

260
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:12,490
high score. This must be what Santa uses to send presents.

261
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:17,799
Cougar in a box. Footbath and piranha aquarium.

262
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:21,940
That's what he sent to us. Grandma's happy pills.

263
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:35,109
My first Moai head. Santa exclusive. Obsess-o-matic stopwatch.

264
00:28:35,109 --> 00:28:42,420
Uh, footbath and piranha aquarium. Just scoop them out.

265
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:46,740
Oh, now we just need to attach a gift tag. Attach a gift tag?

266
00:28:46,819 --> 00:28:50,420
Look. I gotta find out what people want for Christmas. Perfect.

267
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:54,019
I've had a hard time lately getting people to open packages that say

268
00:28:54,019 --> 00:28:57,619
from Max on them. So who should this go to? You don't have yourself to blame for that.

269
00:28:57,619 --> 00:29:20,359
It was worth it. Okay, I just wanted to take a bite of a sandwich, but I just

270
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:22,839
realized that sounded like somebody came up behind me

271
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:32,220
and like put like a fucking covered my mouth and like dragged me away.

272
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:42,069
Then I'm gone. Okay, we got the gift tags.

273
00:29:42,549 --> 00:29:47,740
Let me see. Hold on. Who's it for? No one. Actually, I can't think of-

274
00:29:47,740 --> 00:30:00,890
It's for me. Oops. All right, so I have gift tags. I can put them on the presents.

275
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:10,019
There's a switch too. That turns- All right, so hold on.

276
00:30:10,019 --> 00:30:15,160
Let's stop it right here and then Max jump on the trampoline

277
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:22,220
and get the coin, the star, whatever it is. Go for it, Max.

278
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:29,690
Get it. What the hell? It's a toy bomber.

279
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:32,970
Or a real bomber that just takes tiny warheads.

280
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:36,009
Makes me wish we still had that box of tiny warheads.

281
00:30:36,009 --> 00:30:39,930
Not me. So I can't jump on that? That was our best fishing trip ever.

282
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:44,440
All right, well, slimy crate. What is this gelatinous goo?

283
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,960
I don't know, but for once I don't find myself wanting to eat it.

284
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:52,440
There's a mailing label. To Santa from lower Manitoba.

285
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,119
And they said Santa never gets gifts. Manitoba.

286
00:30:56,119 --> 00:31:03,420
Should you get chicken tenders? Absolutely, get them.

287
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:08,500
I wonder why they call this the Flounder Pounder.

288
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:15,750
So you can shoot tennis balls out. Don't get ten- Why not?

289
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:18,950
That's fine. Just don't- Just get chicken tenders and get like honey

290
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:22,470
mustard sauce. I don't know. The bop buddy pre-adolescent

291
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:25,349
aggression management system. German would never say to get

292
00:31:25,349 --> 00:31:29,670
tenders. Somebody just said should I get tenders and I'm like yeah.

293
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:36,519
It's the world's simplest maze. What's the big deal?

294
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:40,680
All mazes are simple. Not everybody has your knack for lateral sinking and heavy

295
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:46,259
ordnance, Max. This is not fake. Why would you say

296
00:31:46,259 --> 00:31:52,569
something like that? Am I not real enough for you?

297
00:31:52,569 --> 00:32:14,789
I will try harder. Tendies, right? Okay, world's simplest maze.

298
00:32:14,789 --> 00:32:24,980
So let me go talk to Santa. Will he shoot at me?

299
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:38,519
Sugar in water. More, more, more. All right, come on. Give me

300
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:43,079
some intel, Santa. I want intel.

301
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:52,500
Hi, we're collecting guns for tots. Care to make a donation?

302
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:57,369
No siree. Should I give him the kitty litter box?

303
00:32:57,369 --> 00:33:00,650
All right, record player. It's Santa's record player. Do you think it still

304
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:02,970
works? Since we haven't gone near it yet,

305
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:13,740
I assume so. Wait, hold on. Double click to run.

306
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:18,230
That doesn't work. He just walks a little faster. All right, cannon. Wait, wait, wait,

307
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,390
wait. We're gonna have to do like a Rube Goldberg machine here.

308
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:23,990
It's one of those infinitely reloading cannons. Is it loaded?

309
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:30,619
Well, yes. It even has the easy light wick.

310
00:33:30,619 --> 00:33:34,779
Toy Marie Antoinette sold separately. Okay,

311
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:38,700
so what put the other half? We're trying to talk to Santa. You know him?

312
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,980
Oh sure, he's the one who put me in charge here.

313
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:45,339
Was that before or after he went crazy? I'm not sure.

314
00:33:45,339 --> 00:33:49,259
When someone offers me a promotion, I don't ask a lot of questions.

315
00:33:49,259 --> 00:33:58,059
That's a soda popper. Santa fired them to stay competitive with the other major

316
00:33:58,059 --> 00:34:01,500
holidays. We had to outsource our gift manufacturing.

317
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:06,299
How'd the elves take it? They all got together and sang a farewell song.

318
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:09,739
Oh, that's sweet. You didn't hear the song.

319
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:15,420
Let's just say it wasn't very Christmasy. No, no more songs. No more Christmas songs.

320
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,940
What's it like being here? What's it like living at the North Pole? I wouldn't know.

321
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:25,780
I commute. Okay, okay we'll buy. Merry Christmas. Don't remind me. If we don't

322
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:29,940
deal with Santa soon, we'll never make our shipping date.

323
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:33,699
All right, so what about Boxing Betty? It's a Boxing Betty doll.

324
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:38,260
The finest in remote control fisticops. Didn't the Mame-tron teach us

325
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:41,460
anything about the dangers of playing with violent robots?

326
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:46,099
No, I didn't learn anything. Good, I worry sometimes.

327
00:34:46,099 --> 00:34:50,739
Okay, well I have Boxing Betty. Boxing Betty, simple maze,

328
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:56,920
gift tags, gun. It just wouldn't feel like Christmas without the needless

329
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:04,420
destruction of an innocent bystander. Can I put like Boxing Betty on the

330
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:08,619
trampoline and launch Boxing Betty up into the

331
00:35:08,619 --> 00:35:11,849
atmosphere?

332
00:35:12,809 --> 00:35:17,139
I wonder what the elves have on their office computer. Oh, let's read

333
00:35:17,139 --> 00:35:20,500
their email. It's a high score list for Minesweeper.

334
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:24,980
Let's see. Prancer, Wiggles, Shambling corporate presents.

335
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:28,260
How'd that get there? Well, pretty soon it's gonna be all

336
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:32,099
max. Now how do I start a new game? Sorry, I think it's

337
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:36,500
frozen. Torture? What does that say? Icey arctic wasteland. Hold on, what does that mean?

338
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:43,880
I need to see it. There's a, there's a torture thing over here.

339
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:51,739
Torture me Elmer, product testing. It's a torture me Elmer doll. Look, he comes

340
00:35:51,739 --> 00:35:58,230
with his own breakable spirit and detachable retinas. What the

341
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:05,900
fuck? Seeing all these toys kind of makes me wish I was a kid again.

342
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:09,260
If it's any consolation, I still think of you as a child.

343
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:37,559
Thanks, I wish the courts did. No, you can only do that for three

344
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:44,380
seconds before people start to leave. All right, we got uh. Hi guys. Let me

345
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:59,320
check, wait, wait, wait. See you later guys. Did we do this to him?

346
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:06,420
It's a topiary planted in a tiny clay pot.

347
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:10,869
You guys, you guys are the, I think you guys might be the villains here.

348
00:37:10,869 --> 00:37:15,269
This must be Santa's sleigh. Where does he attach the flying reindeer?

349
00:37:15,269 --> 00:37:19,590
There's a boiler on the back. Whoa, tough break for the reindeer.

350
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:24,179
Wait, I want to, before you don't leave yet, let me see what this

351
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:28,579
out of you as a child. Thanks, I wish the courts did.

352
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:41,420
All right, that's fucked up. All right, I'll give that to you. That's fucked up.

353
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:51,659
Santa's coal-powered sleigh. Sleigh. Where are the reindeer? Whoa, you

354
00:37:51,659 --> 00:37:54,889
actually can run. You guys weren't lying. I can

355
00:37:54,889 --> 00:37:58,409
snowball. Let's think about the snowball. Boxing Betty.

356
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:07,019
Gift. Tags. Snowball. Um, let's see snowball.

357
00:38:07,099 --> 00:38:10,860
Again and head. Baseball throw into dude's face.

358
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:25,449
Didn't even break. The co-op Jupiters are really good today.

359
00:38:25,449 --> 00:38:36,070
They tend to be. All right, what about Santa? Throw it at Santa?

360
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:39,349
It's a bot. Oh no, no, it better not be.

361
00:38:39,349 --> 00:38:45,289
I don't like to hear that. No, they teach you how to dodge snowballs on

362
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:53,130
day one of elf orientation. Should I shoot back at Santa?

363
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:55,369
I feel like there's an elaborate puzzle here that I need to be thinking

364
00:38:55,369 --> 00:39:02,099
of rather than throw snowballs at people. I think I'll save my gun.

365
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:22,250
North pole. Okay, all right. Well, let's just leave.

366
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:27,210
Use Max on the torture rack. No. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

367
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:29,769
Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Can I actually shoot

368
00:39:29,769 --> 00:39:43,849
the cannon? I'm not going to do that. Whoa,

369
00:39:43,849 --> 00:39:48,150
because that line, I lined it up with the, what's not lined up anymore?

370
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:58,090
It should be, right? So can I put it right in front of it? Like right

371
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:02,699
here? No. I need to shoot the toy bomber.

372
00:40:02,699 --> 00:40:11,449
It's very obvious. No, you can only stop it here.

373
00:40:11,449 --> 00:40:20,840
I can't stop it anywhere else. How is it obvious? Well, I mean, I have to

374
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:27,699
move it and then get it right. Okay, it doesn't work.

375
00:40:27,699 --> 00:40:31,059
What happened to Santa? I don't know, but if you ask me,

376
00:40:31,059 --> 00:40:34,179
it was only a matter of time before he snapped.

377
00:40:34,179 --> 00:40:38,019
He's always been a little crazy. He has?

378
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:42,099
Think about it. The man gives presents away for free.

379
00:40:42,099 --> 00:40:46,260
I always assumed he did it for the tax write-off.

380
00:40:48,329 --> 00:40:53,159
Ah, that's right, right. Oh, that's a good humor right there. Who manufactures

381
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,880
the toys now? It's all been moved off site, so

382
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:03,530
officially speaking, I have no idea. What about unofficially? Baby penguins.

383
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:07,289
Why on earth would you use baby penguins? The adults refuse to work

384
00:41:07,289 --> 00:41:11,769
without a health plan. Santa paid more in taxes in 2018

385
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:14,570
than Amazon.

386
00:41:15,349 --> 00:41:19,349
I mean, think about that. That is a funny joke. Santa is operating at such a

387
00:41:19,349 --> 00:41:24,630
massive loss. Oh, the elves make the toys, but

388
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:27,909
Santa, buddy, I gotta have payroll. They're probably, and he's gotta give

389
00:41:27,909 --> 00:41:32,150
toys to literally everybody on earth. That's the thing. That's the lore,

390
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:34,489
right? You just wake up and there's a bunch

391
00:41:34,489 --> 00:41:38,579
of fucking shit expensive stuff under your tree to

392
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:43,099
millions and millions of families. Santa is operating at like a 40 to 50

393
00:41:43,099 --> 00:41:47,099
billion dollar loss every year. I don't know, where's he getting the

394
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:51,820
money? Who is like leveraging and insuring Santa

395
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:59,019
Claus? He might not even be real. I mean, I

396
00:41:59,019 --> 00:42:00,940
don't know where the presents come from. I just assumed

397
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:04,780
that they just, they just were kind of, he did it. I don't know, he might

398
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:10,230
not be real. That's kind of weird to think about.

399
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:14,469
Wait, if it's like 50 to 100 billion dollars a year and nobody pays it,

400
00:42:14,469 --> 00:42:19,530
but what about the guy that's at the mall? There's a person, there's a

401
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:22,940
guy, I guess you could just, you could dress

402
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:32,199
up as that guy, but they say it's him. It could be an actor.

403
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:39,769
Merry Christmas. If you say so. Fuck. No, but then how,

404
00:42:39,769 --> 00:42:45,610
then where did I get my stuff? When I was like,

405
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:55,239
parents might have done it. I gotta take a,

406
00:42:55,239 --> 00:43:01,739
I gotta take a quick break after this. I'm just gonna make a couple phone

407
00:43:01,739 --> 00:43:10,090
calls. Where to, Sam? On second thought, let's just stay here.

408
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:13,690
Kind of, my whole world's kind of crumbling on me right now.

409
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:19,940
Trying to figure out what the fuck is going on here. I can't leave!

410
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:23,059
Where to, Sam? On second thought, let's just stay here.

411
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:28,389
Okay, well I have to figure this out. Simplest maze. Max, come here.

412
00:43:28,389 --> 00:43:33,130
Can you do this? When one of the soda poppers touches this?

413
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:37,429
Then they try to give me something I didn't want. Give me a snowball.

414
00:43:37,429 --> 00:43:44,599
Let's try throwing snowballs and stuff. I didn't do shit, don't stop

415
00:43:44,599 --> 00:43:59,380
saying that. Throw a snowball at me. Baby

416
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:01,059
penguins. Do penguins do good work?

417
00:44:01,059 --> 00:44:04,900
Sure, if you don't mind toys that have a slightly fishy smell.

418
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:09,059
Giving them or receiving them? You can use the gift tube over there and see

419
00:44:09,059 --> 00:44:11,460
for yourself. Gift tube, we already clicked on it.

420
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:14,260
Okay, we want to talk to Sam. We've already done this.

421
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:17,619
I don't think talking is going to do any good.

422
00:44:17,619 --> 00:44:21,940
All he wants to do is shoot everything. That's understandable.

423
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:25,059
You gotta get his gun away from him or he's gonna make us do

424
00:44:25,059 --> 00:44:28,900
bad things. Get the gun away. Merry Christmas.

425
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:31,619
Don't remind me if we don't deal with Santa.

426
00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:35,019
Yep, all right. What about you? You have anything else to say?

427
00:44:35,019 --> 00:44:38,380
What are you doing? So what do you do here? I'm supposed to make this tree

428
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:42,300
grow. Oh. By crying. Christmas trees love

429
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:47,659
elf tears. Heck, who doesn't? It makes them grow up big and fast.

430
00:44:47,659 --> 00:44:51,500
But I'm too darn happy. I'll never be able to cry.

431
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:54,300
So we gotta make him cry. It's enough to make you cry.

432
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:59,210
I wish. Throw a snowball at his face. I bet we could make you cry.

433
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:03,210
Thanks. I've been trying to cry but I'm just too darn happy.

434
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:06,730
We can fix that. In fact, that's about the only thing we can fix.

435
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:11,449
If you want to make me cry, go ahead. We want to. We want to.

436
00:45:11,449 --> 00:45:16,010
Me first. Okay, wait, wait, wait. We killed your dog. I'll feed you to a

437
00:45:16,010 --> 00:45:20,489
polar bear. I'll rip your eyes out. You were adopted. Santa isn't real.

438
00:45:20,489 --> 00:45:24,489
You're fired. I give up. All right, hold on. Should we drop this

439
00:45:24,489 --> 00:45:28,329
absolute bombshell on him? You don't still believe in Santa Claus, do you?

440
00:45:28,329 --> 00:45:32,650
Sure I do. I saw him this morning. Well, I hate to be the one to break it to you

441
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:36,570
but Santa isn't real. He's just make believe.

442
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:40,969
Like the black Easter bunny or elves. But I'm an elf.

443
00:45:40,969 --> 00:45:45,929
That's what makes this so hard. Wait a second. Are you saying I don't exist?

444
00:45:45,929 --> 00:45:49,050
I got him. Can you prove that you exist? Well, sure. Got him.

445
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:53,639
I mean, no, I guess I can't. Got him.

446
00:45:53,639 --> 00:46:04,440
Ouch, tough break. Surprise, we were lying. Congratulations, you exist.

447
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:10,179
Nice try, but I don't believe in you either.

448
00:46:10,179 --> 00:46:17,619
Grow? Excellent. Hey, my snowball melted.

449
00:46:17,619 --> 00:46:21,539
All right, so now it's bigger. That's a big honking tree.

450
00:46:21,539 --> 00:46:26,659
Those elf tears really work. So now,

451
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:33,130
uh, is this gonna bump into the tree?

452
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:37,210
No, I thought it could have, like, stopped at a bump into one or something. I don't know, dude.

453
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:40,730
Um, all right, cannon. But let me, hold on.

454
00:46:40,730 --> 00:47:05,000
There's a demon at the top of the tree. Yeah, there it is. All right, so we can throw

455
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:10,280
snowball at, give me this. Well, I can't believe he filled up the entire can.

456
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:14,840
Yeah, we must have really terrified the poor guy. Good work, little buddy.

457
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:19,800
Oh, stop. Now you're gonna make me cry. He shat the line, little buddy.

458
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:24,179
All right, let's throw snowball at cannon.

459
00:47:24,179 --> 00:47:27,619
The cannon's already loaded. No, snowball.

460
00:47:27,619 --> 00:47:32,710
He's already cried. There's this thing, snowball

461
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:37,989
into this thing. I think I'll save my snowball for a more satisfying target.

462
00:47:37,989 --> 00:47:49,820
Okay, snowball. No. Can I make something else grow? Can I make the

463
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:55,940
trampoline grow? Hey, my snowball. Maybe a bigger

464
00:47:55,940 --> 00:48:02,380
trampoline? I can't water that. Why not? Wait, do I have any other stuff

465
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:12,199
in my office or something? Can I leave now?

466
00:48:12,199 --> 00:48:21,590
There is something out here. Can we grow? I remember this thing. All right, so that's huge.

467
00:48:21,590 --> 00:48:25,429
Give me the rest of those elf tears. I've got a date with an unsuspecting

468
00:48:25,429 --> 00:48:28,710
metropolis. Sorry, little buddy. They only work on

469
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:32,469
plants. Only on plants. You win again, Tokyo!

470
00:48:32,469 --> 00:48:48,889
Giant topiary. I know it's called a topiary.

471
00:48:48,889 --> 00:48:56,519
So now we're in Santa's room. Merry Christmas!

472
00:48:56,519 --> 00:49:00,280
We come bearing good cheer and high-powered pistols.

473
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:08,420
Chuck-a-bump fairies! Santa, you okay in there?

474
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:17,780
Wait, why are we coming down again?

475
00:49:18,969 --> 00:49:23,179
Okay, so we have to be quiet. Now, let's see here. We've got

476
00:49:23,179 --> 00:49:29,480
Boxing Betty. Simple maze. That's his aggro zone. Santa's safe.

477
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:39,050
Bookshelf photo. Exit. Santa's hat. It's Santa's hat. Do you think it's

478
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:43,210
magical? Nope. The tag says it's 100% polyester.

479
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:47,530
Wow, that's the exact opposite of magical. I'm not gonna shoot him. That's not the solution.

480
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:54,019
Okay, we've got... Grr?

481
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:10,599
All right, I'm gonna shoot him now. That was my one shot. That was my one chance.

482
00:50:10,599 --> 00:50:13,800
I can't shoot Santa Claus. What if I missed?

483
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:17,960
That'd just make him even meaner. But don't miss.

484
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:21,860
Problem solved. Boxing Betty. All right, wait, wait, wait, wait.

485
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:26,179
Wait, what's... Christmas record? Record player?

486
00:50:26,179 --> 00:50:29,780
Oh, it includes the smash hit, the friendly demon song.

487
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:32,659
I can't think of anything to say right now. He'll come up.

488
00:50:32,659 --> 00:50:40,119
Okay, so record player Parchment. Their exorcism instructions.

489
00:50:40,119 --> 00:50:45,400
Wicked! I want to do it now! But we don't know anyone who's possessed

490
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:49,400
or doing. Possessed. How do we start? Hey kids,

491
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:54,760
want to silence those inner voices? Do I? No more messy arcane rituals.

492
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:58,039
The My Little Demon playset makes it easy. First,

493
00:50:58,039 --> 00:51:01,719
signal the emergence of the demon with the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse

494
00:51:01,719 --> 00:51:07,530
action figures, sold separately. Ask your parents to help you place the

495
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:10,329
horsemen around a powerful magnetic pole.

496
00:51:10,329 --> 00:51:14,889
Roman Polanski? Finally, draw the hell spawn out by singing the friendly

497
00:51:14,889 --> 00:51:17,769
demon song, using personal information about your

498
00:51:17,769 --> 00:51:24,739
demon. He won't be able to resist. Okay, so we need four horsemen.

499
00:51:24,739 --> 00:51:31,349
We need the four horsemen. Where am I going to get the four horsemen?

500
00:51:31,349 --> 00:51:39,829
Performance reviews for young children. Well, at least I have the

501
00:51:39,829 --> 00:51:43,670
record. It's either a trip to the zoo or Santa's gotten remarried.

502
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:46,710
Either way, I can't tell what he sees in her.

503
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:50,969
Yeah, I think you'd need a wider lens. All right.

504
00:51:50,969 --> 00:51:53,849
Well, can I put on the coat? I can't touch any of this stuff. I've never

505
00:51:53,849 --> 00:51:57,210
seen Santa take his coat off before. Now that you mention it, I don't

506
00:51:57,210 --> 00:51:59,929
think I've ever seen you take your coat off either.

507
00:51:59,929 --> 00:52:04,570
I haven't. Reindeer? Wait, this is one of the reindeer? It's either

508
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:11,239
dasher or dancer. Well, let's just see what we can do now. We

509
00:52:11,239 --> 00:52:17,800
have a way to get in. So I'm gonna assume we can

510
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:22,789
eventually hear. I got the record and exorcism instructions.

511
00:52:22,789 --> 00:52:39,719
Can I play the record? There's a whole lot of random stuff in here that I

512
00:52:39,719 --> 00:52:51,179
feel like I'm missing. Naruto? Why you gotta say Naruto?

513
00:52:51,260 --> 00:53:02,900
Let's put on the friendly demon song.

514
00:53:08,099 --> 00:53:16,969
What? What? Very scary demon. We had him. Like two ferrets and a dolphin

515
00:53:16,969 --> 00:53:23,829
stapled together.

516
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:46,179
In the bathtub of 94 Honda Civic. I pull the tail off the donkey.

517
00:53:46,179 --> 00:53:50,579
Hey, nameless one of his homilinkers. Hey, he has a thousand unanswered

518
00:53:50,579 --> 00:53:54,420
supplies. Hey, Shambling Corporate Presence. Hey,

519
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:59,849
Shambling Corporate Presence. I don't think that's how the song goes.

520
00:53:59,849 --> 00:54:11,420
So we have to, all right. We have uh, what would it,

521
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:18,409
who's on here? Who's number one? It's a high score list for Minesweeper.

522
00:54:18,409 --> 00:54:21,849
Prancer, Wiggles, and the Shambling Corporate Presence.

523
00:54:21,849 --> 00:54:32,070
Okay, Prancer. So these are all references to stuff in

524
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:40,199
the I.K. All right. So let me look at that again.

525
00:54:40,199 --> 00:54:43,400
It's Santa's record player. It's Santa. Oh, play it.

526
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:55,530
Let me just see what those options were again.

527
00:54:58,409 --> 00:55:06,860
Very scary form. IRS 1040. I mean, that's, didn't they make an IRS

528
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:13,300
gelatinous goo? Because that's what's in the box.

529
00:55:14,329 --> 00:55:16,329
I'm going to say this one.

530
00:55:20,519 --> 00:55:27,019
Most unholy creature that was ever born. Okay, Manitoba.

531
00:55:27,019 --> 00:55:38,260
In lower Manitoba. What's on the box? It's like Minesweeper, right? Because the

532
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:49,739
computer. Shout his name. Prancer. Oh, shit.

533
00:55:49,739 --> 00:55:59,659
That's not the, the Corporate Presence didn't win. Is it that?

534
00:55:59,659 --> 00:56:05,849
That's no, no, no. That's the only, that's the only possible option.

535
00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:10,650
Oh, the song seemed right. I guess we must not have all the

536
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:13,449
horsemen in place. Oh, fuck. I have to have to put them over here.

537
00:56:13,449 --> 00:56:17,210
I have to have four horsemen. Hey, it's the North Pole,

538
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:20,889
the magnetic center of the earth. Well, magnetism.

539
00:56:20,889 --> 00:56:25,289
Don't tell me you're one of those kooks. You don't believe in magnetism.

540
00:56:25,289 --> 00:56:28,329
It's an interesting theory, but I'm not convinced.

541
00:56:28,329 --> 00:56:32,650
Your magnetism is a cute bedtime story, but I believe in one

542
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:39,260
thing. Okay, fine. I can't believe this works.

543
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:42,840
I believe in two things, but that's my limit.

544
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:49,960
Max is a flat earther. All right, so we need four people or four things

545
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:55,699
out here. How do we, where the hell does that come into play?

546
00:56:55,699 --> 00:57:01,190
Is it the soda poppers? It's only three. Who's the fourth?

547
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:11,829
Is it Max? Hi, guys. Why don't you go inside?

548
00:57:11,829 --> 00:57:15,429
We're waiting for the shootout to end. I can respect that.

549
00:57:15,429 --> 00:57:21,590
How? So I have to stop Santa from doing that. See you later, guys. So they go inside so I

550
00:57:21,590 --> 00:57:33,219
can teleport them to hell. All right, maybe something with the gifts.

551
00:57:33,219 --> 00:57:40,039
No, but I don't have it. Can I leave yet? Where to, Sam?

552
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:42,280
Okay, I can leave. Let's go back to the office. Let's head back to

553
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:46,280
civilization or what's left of it. Good thinking. We can always freeze to

554
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:59,219
death out here later. Drive from here to there because I

555
00:57:59,219 --> 00:58:01,460
couldn't leave before. This is the first time I've been able

556
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:05,699
to come back to the town. All right, well hold on. Sibyl's is, is

557
00:58:05,699 --> 00:58:08,900
Sibyl alive in here? Sibyl's not here. It's closed.

558
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:12,420
Open 24 hours unless I don't feel like it.

559
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:17,059
Or a giant robot tosses the entire building a city block.

560
00:58:17,059 --> 00:58:22,860
Poor Sibyl. Sorry, Sibyl. We tried. All right, boss goes for the first time.

561
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:30,789
Who's this rat? It's not a clickable rat. New S&M

562
00:58:30,789 --> 00:58:33,829
season. It's a shame you don't wear collars, Sam.

563
00:58:33,829 --> 00:58:37,750
It says they're coming back in style. Sam back.

564
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:42,070
U.S. to Macroheart Corporation. I wondered why the stock market kept

565
00:58:42,070 --> 00:58:45,929
crashing. All right, let's go in. How's Bosco

566
00:58:45,929 --> 00:58:54,650
doing in season two? Welcome to Bosco's

567
00:58:54,650 --> 00:58:58,010
inconvenience. Please wait while I determine whether

568
00:58:58,010 --> 00:59:02,409
you are truly welcome or if I am just uttering idle pleasantries.

569
00:59:02,409 --> 00:59:05,929
Nothing says inconvenience like a full body search before you can buy

570
00:59:06,010 --> 00:59:08,170
your candy cigarettes and all day suckers.

571
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:13,380
You have been deemed not unacceptable. Welcome.

572
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:19,860
Bosco, your disguise. It's, it's, it's hideous. Claw my eyes out, Sam. I can't

573
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:23,380
bear to look at it. Not if I claw my own eyes out first.

574
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:26,900
He's not going to be in a costume. I'm not wearing a disguise.

575
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:32,019
I know comedy. I forgot how ugly you were without a wig or hat or something.

576
00:59:32,019 --> 00:59:40,409
My package. All right, so what, uh, what, what package? Say Bosco, what's in the-

577
00:59:40,409 --> 00:59:43,769
Hey guys, does my package sound like it's ticking to you?

578
00:59:43,769 --> 00:59:47,289
Not your best pickup line, Bosco. Oh, I don't know.

579
00:59:47,289 --> 00:59:51,050
I think my package is the bomb. Now that's

580
00:59:51,050 --> 00:59:58,170
a pickup line. Okay. Keep going. Who would send you a bomb?

581
00:59:58,170 --> 01:00:02,409
My mother, of course. She sends me one every year around this time.

582
01:00:02,409 --> 01:00:06,409
What the? Families need traditions. So why don't you just get rid of it?

583
01:00:06,409 --> 01:00:10,250
I built that bomb disposal unit for that very purpose.

584
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:15,690
So why don't you just get rid of it? Because it might be the billion dollar

585
01:00:15,690 --> 01:00:22,010
plunger I just ordered. What a dilemma. Billion dollar. Just open it. Just open

586
01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:25,610
your package, Bosco. What if it's the bomb? I thought I

587
01:00:25,610 --> 01:00:30,630
heard ticket. Just get rid of your package, Bosco.

588
01:00:30,630 --> 01:00:35,449
Forehead. But what if it's my plunger? I gotta be sure it's ticket.

589
01:00:35,449 --> 01:00:40,099
Just open your package, Bosco. Just get rid of your package, Bosco.

590
01:00:40,099 --> 01:00:44,300
But what- Just open your package, Bosco.

591
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:54,679
Just get rid of your package, Bosco. That's-

592
01:00:54,679 --> 01:01:06,039
that's the shit I gotta deal with on a day-to-day basis.

593
01:01:06,039 --> 01:01:10,039
I know what it's like. Why not disguise it?

594
01:01:10,039 --> 01:01:13,719
No hilariously inadequate disguise this time? Sam, Sam, Sam, you

595
01:01:13,719 --> 01:01:19,400
poor naive fool. Don't you realize the time for disguises is past?

596
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:22,840
Yeah, you poor naive fool. Don't you realize that?

597
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:26,840
Quiet, head knuckle. A disguise could never protect you from

598
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:36,039
T-H-E-M. Them. You scared me. Who's them?

599
01:01:36,039 --> 01:01:39,480
That's exactly what I'm trying to figure out. I'm watching,

600
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:43,880
I'm listening, and I will find T-H-E-M.

601
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:50,659
Well, if you do, tell them- Okay, this is getting old fast.

602
01:01:50,659 --> 01:02:01,510
Them. Them. That's great, I love it. Just open your package, Bosco.

603
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:06,949
What- Them. Just get rid of your package, Bosco.

604
01:02:06,949 --> 01:02:13,159
But what if it- Them. Welcome to every German 985 stream.

605
01:02:13,159 --> 01:02:19,219
Just open- Them. Just get rid of your package, Bosco.

606
01:02:19,219 --> 01:02:34,460
But what if- Them. Oh, shit!

607
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:43,320
I don't do that, though. I don't do that. I can't do that.

608
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:47,159
What's with your store? I'm not sure if you noticed, but this ain't-

609
01:02:47,159 --> 01:02:51,860
Jokes do always go wrong. I haven't noticed anything.

610
01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:55,619
Look, I've got a hundred trillion dollars and a thousand faceless

611
01:02:55,619 --> 01:02:59,780
enemies. I don't need to sell anything. Then why keep the place open?

612
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:04,730
I'm a people person. You would if you could. No, I would not.

613
01:03:04,730 --> 01:03:09,369
I love you guys, you guys are great. You think I would ever do that?

614
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:13,449
Okay, what's the door scanner? What's with the fancy dance scanner, Bosco?

615
01:03:13,449 --> 01:03:17,769
Tools are necessary. Tools are the only things that separate us from the

616
01:03:17,769 --> 01:03:20,409
animals. That probably plays a little better

617
01:03:20,409 --> 01:03:24,250
with the non-dog and rabbit ground. That's why I need the personal

618
01:03:24,329 --> 01:03:28,090
antipathy registration annulment and non-negational

619
01:03:28,090 --> 01:03:32,650
omnifunctional identification device. That's just paranoid.

620
01:03:32,650 --> 01:03:37,130
Technically, yes it is. Okay, oh here we got another one of these.

621
01:03:37,130 --> 01:03:40,889
Do you have any bulletproof edible underwear? I don't have

622
01:03:40,889 --> 01:03:44,250
anything. This ain't a store. It's not a store anymore.

623
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:47,449
Do you have any lords of leaping and or maids of milking?

624
01:03:47,449 --> 01:03:51,610
I told you this ain't a store. I'm gonna get punched.

625
01:03:51,610 --> 01:03:55,289
Do you have any inflatable arms capable of being used as replacements for your

626
01:03:55,289 --> 01:03:59,050
real arms? Didn't I just tell you this ain't a store

627
01:03:59,050 --> 01:04:03,590
no more? Do you have any passive aggressive

628
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:06,789
payback disguised as an innocuous customer inquiry?

629
01:04:06,789 --> 01:04:13,670
Punch. Do you have any- No! This ain't a store!

630
01:04:13,670 --> 01:04:18,860
It's not? No! Oh, why didn't you say so?

631
01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:22,460
A trillion dollars worth of detection equipment and yet he still didn't see

632
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:29,030
that one coming a mile away. Now the store looks interesting.

633
01:04:29,030 --> 01:04:32,789
It ain't a store no more. And did you know people who say that-

634
01:04:32,789 --> 01:04:36,389
Wow, I'm being a real asshole. Are more likely to be serial killers?

635
01:04:36,389 --> 01:04:39,750
More likely than who? Than non-serial killers.

636
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:43,110
It's a fact. A fact they don't want you to know.

637
01:04:43,110 --> 01:04:49,159
Who doesn't want me to know? Exactly.

638
01:04:49,159 --> 01:04:52,440
Hold on. My regards to your decorator. I like this. Yeah, what's the style?

639
01:04:52,519 --> 01:04:57,880
Early colonial conspiracy theorist? No, a theorist is somebody who has a theory.

640
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:03,079
I have conspiracy facts. So I guess you'd be a conspiracy factist.

641
01:05:03,079 --> 01:05:07,480
He's certainly not a cluist. Conspiracy factist.

642
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:13,079
Because he doesn't have a clue. Yeah, I got it.

643
01:05:13,079 --> 01:05:16,039
All right. Enough about your store. It's not a-

644
01:05:16,119 --> 01:05:23,059
Oh, forget it. Just open your package, Bosco.

645
01:05:23,059 --> 01:05:25,780
See ya, Bosco.

646
01:05:26,739 --> 01:05:31,079
All right. Bomb be gone. Can we borrow your bomb be gone?

647
01:05:31,079 --> 01:05:34,360
There's some obsolete landmines around the office we need to get rid of.

648
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:37,719
No. If I loaned my bomb disposal unit out to everyone in the

649
01:05:37,719 --> 01:05:40,280
neighborhood who needed it, I'd never get it back.

650
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:44,280
You know, in this neighborhood that's actually true.

651
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:48,409
X-ray machine. So it's not a store. It really isn't.

652
01:05:48,409 --> 01:05:54,380
Theory of everything. Suddenly, it all makes sense.

653
01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:57,019
I can't see where we fit into all this, Sam.

654
01:05:57,019 --> 01:06:04,139
Oh, I've got a couple of walls upstairs devoted to YouTube.

655
01:06:04,139 --> 01:06:07,019
That's not the shit that he made. That's not the stuff that he

656
01:06:07,019 --> 01:06:10,539
researched. All right, X-ray machine. Hey, an X-ray machine.

657
01:06:10,539 --> 01:06:15,559
Don't fool with that. X-ray boxing bag.

658
01:06:15,559 --> 01:06:20,969
Don't fool with that. X-ray... What about these?

659
01:06:20,969 --> 01:06:23,769
To exorcise the demon, it says we'll need to

660
01:06:23,849 --> 01:06:27,130
collect the four horsemen of the apocalypse action figures. Place the

661
01:06:27,130 --> 01:06:30,570
horsemen around a magnetic pole and draw the demon out using the

662
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:34,170
friendly demon stone. We just need the four horsemen.

663
01:06:34,170 --> 01:06:39,769
Enlarger. I wonder if we can enlarge anything else.

664
01:06:39,769 --> 01:06:49,050
No, Max. No. Okay, if the tears make things grow,

665
01:06:49,050 --> 01:06:53,239
I'm not gonna say it because that's an easy

666
01:06:53,239 --> 01:07:00,440
low-hanging fruit. Fill in the blank. All right, so

667
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:13,190
I'm not, let me go check the other stuff. Wait, this is open?

668
01:07:13,190 --> 01:07:18,139
Stinky's Diner is open. Stinky's Diner.

669
01:07:18,139 --> 01:07:20,780
It's back in business. We're gonna, a new character? An excited neighborhood

670
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:26,780
reopens its arms and its emergency rooms. Stinky's

671
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:30,059
Diner. I'm excited for a new character. Ah, the

672
01:07:30,059 --> 01:07:34,059
smell of desiccated eggs, congealing bacon fat and rye bread gone

673
01:07:34,059 --> 01:07:36,539
awry. It's like Stinky's Diner never

674
01:07:36,579 --> 01:07:42,940
closed. Welcome to Stinky's. We never close except when we're closed.

675
01:07:42,940 --> 01:07:46,940
Who are you? Is it Stinky? I'm Stinky. The Stinky we know was a

676
01:07:46,940 --> 01:07:50,860
cantankerous old man who transformed his seething hatred of humanity into a

677
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:53,980
misanthropic smorgasbord of culinary horrors.

678
01:07:53,980 --> 01:07:58,300
That does sound like grandpa. Okay, we're ready for the next round of

679
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:01,179
trivia and the question is... They're alive!

680
01:08:01,820 --> 01:08:03,820
They're alive!

681
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:18,420
Bangers and match. Do I get the answer?

682
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:28,069
I can't. Okay, alpha horn. Bug. Oh wait, it's a bug.

683
01:08:37,510 --> 01:08:50,550
I've got two people living in there.

684
01:08:51,109 --> 01:08:56,979
Why'd you play back that demon recording? I've got a case of PISD,

685
01:08:56,979 --> 01:09:01,699
post insecticide stress disorder. It keeps causing these flashbacks.

686
01:09:01,699 --> 01:09:05,859
How so? I get a whiff of something familiar and the memories just come

687
01:09:05,859 --> 01:09:08,420
rushing back. All right, so you get a smell. Must have been some brimstone in the

688
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:11,380
air during that exorcism. Oh, was that brimstone?

689
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:14,659
This whole time I just assumed you let out a 200 pound fart.

690
01:09:14,659 --> 01:09:23,130
No, it was brimstone, honest. Okay. You don't get along with your family?

691
01:09:23,130 --> 01:09:27,689
Negative. Except for my dad. They're all a bunch of spineless ladybugs.

692
01:09:27,689 --> 01:09:30,890
Aren't all bugs spineless? Not in my regiment.

693
01:09:30,890 --> 01:09:34,890
If you didn't have a spine, by god, my dad would make you grow a pair.

694
01:09:34,890 --> 01:09:38,250
A pair of spines? That's just the kind of bug he was.

695
01:09:38,250 --> 01:09:42,409
Oh, I forgot about the dream. Like, I had a dream last night.

696
01:09:42,409 --> 01:09:46,039
This is important. Really important. Pause this for a second.

697
01:09:46,039 --> 01:09:50,199
I actually can pause this. So listen to this shit. So last night I had a

698
01:09:50,199 --> 01:09:55,159
dream, and this is, it was too real. So I had a dream. You know how people

699
01:09:55,159 --> 01:09:59,500
have dreams about me streaming? They say, dude, I was having this

700
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:02,699
dream, you're streaming it, you got sucked up, the gray fluid went into

701
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:06,779
your brain, and then I... So I was having a dream that I was

702
01:10:06,779 --> 01:10:11,350
streaming. And I turned on the webcam. I don't

703
01:10:11,350 --> 01:10:13,430
know what game I was playing, what didn't matter, but that was about, I

704
01:10:13,430 --> 01:10:16,470
was gonna do like a joke that I thought was gonna be funny.

705
01:10:16,470 --> 01:10:19,670
And everyone was like, oh, joke incoming, joke incoming,

706
01:10:19,670 --> 01:10:24,939
webcam's on, and I was like, I didn't have anything. I had nothing.

707
01:10:24,939 --> 01:10:27,739
So I was like, oh fuck, I gotta think of something funny to do quick,

708
01:10:27,739 --> 01:10:30,939
because I didn't, I don't like have a joke ready. And I like did the turn on

709
01:10:30,939 --> 01:10:34,149
the webcam thing. So I just started going like this. I

710
01:10:34,149 --> 01:10:38,069
started punching towards the camera, and every time I would punch, I was

711
01:10:38,069 --> 01:10:43,100
going, I'm gonna get you guys with some karate!

712
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:46,460
And it was like minus twos, and people would just like, I did it like

713
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:51,640
four or five times in a row. And I remember right when I stopped

714
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:54,520
doing it, I was like that, this was not even funny,

715
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:58,279
that was not even, that was horrible. And I was like, I'm just like kidding, I

716
01:10:58,279 --> 01:11:02,920
turned off the webcam, and I was still asleep. And I went

717
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:07,060
through the rest of my night, walking around like eating, I just

718
01:11:07,060 --> 01:11:10,180
have these vague weird flashes of me lying in my bed,

719
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:13,800
being like, fuck, that like, that really, that joke really sucked.

720
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:16,520
Ah, it's all right, like I'll come back tomorrow and like do something funny,

721
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:24,760
and then I woke up. That was yesterday.

722
01:11:28,489 --> 01:11:36,550
Imagine if this actually happened.

723
01:11:37,670 --> 01:11:41,029
I'm so fucked up, and like delirious, and so

724
01:11:41,029 --> 01:11:44,229
scatterbrained, that I don't even remember what I did yesterday,

725
01:11:44,229 --> 01:11:55,369
and I thought it was a dream. He doesn't remember it.

726
01:11:55,369 --> 01:12:12,659
He's not even funny in his dreams! No, I'm not. Here we go, let's go.

727
01:12:12,659 --> 01:12:16,340
I just, that makes it even funnier in my brain, that like this actually

728
01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:24,680
happened. And I thought it was, I don't have any

729
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:31,800
clothes on, I can't turn my webcam on. I was like, punch, punch, punch, I call

730
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:36,359
raw tea to you guys! And people hated it. That didn't happen

731
01:12:36,359 --> 01:12:44,819
yesterday. No, stop fucking with my head! No,

732
01:12:44,819 --> 01:12:50,659
no, this is not like time travel, guys. I don't have to like redo the

733
01:12:50,659 --> 01:12:53,859
thing that I did to keep the timeline going correctly.

734
01:12:53,859 --> 01:13:00,359
What do you mean we have the clip? What are you linking?

735
01:13:00,359 --> 01:13:11,000
Hold on. No, it's not the slap. What is that, what,

736
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:26,939
Effectator, what are you linking here? This, what is this?

737
01:13:26,939 --> 01:13:33,880
I missed my cue! Oh, wait, you already did this?

738
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:41,989
Wait, what is this one? Wait, how did you get this already?

739
01:13:41,989 --> 01:13:50,699
Oh, here comes a joke. Karate! Oh, I already hate it. Not the video, but

740
01:13:50,699 --> 01:14:03,100
hold on. I missed my cue! Well, hold on.

741
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:14,300
Wait, wait, wait, wait, I took a bite out of a sandwich.

742
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:21,989
God damn it. Don't, I can't restart it. God damn, that was a perfect

743
01:14:21,989 --> 01:14:26,229
opportunity. I took a bite out of my sandwich. I

744
01:14:26,229 --> 01:14:30,739
have a sandwich over here. Hold on. I was gonna, I was gonna go

745
01:14:30,739 --> 01:14:35,699
like this. It's too late now, but just add it.

746
01:14:35,699 --> 01:14:38,180
Add it. Somebody add it to the end of that. I know something's gonna fucking

747
01:14:38,180 --> 01:14:44,380
clip it or something, but add this.

748
01:14:54,939 --> 01:15:10,420
That was not what I did. That was not even close to what I did.

749
01:15:10,420 --> 01:15:18,310
All right, let me play the game. Recreate the karate joke!

750
01:15:18,310 --> 01:15:21,989
No! I, hold on, let me put on like a blanket.

751
01:15:25,819 --> 01:15:30,439
Bag on my body. I need a shirt. Hair. This is fine.

752
01:15:30,439 --> 01:15:41,189
Will this cover enough? Yeah, no, this is fine. This, this will cover it up.

753
01:15:41,189 --> 01:15:48,859
This is essentially wearing a shirt. Is it? I need to look.

754
01:15:48,859 --> 01:15:51,579
I need to see where the camera is, because this, I, this is a, this

755
01:15:51,579 --> 01:16:14,279
functions as a t-shirt. Yeah, we're good. Oh, we're good.

756
01:16:14,279 --> 01:16:23,829
Okay. Yeah, this functions as a t-shirt. Okay.

757
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:30,470
So I said, hey, it's time for some karate!

758
01:16:30,470 --> 01:16:53,880
That's what I did. And that's like a SpongeBob thing, right?

759
01:16:53,880 --> 01:17:00,729
Oh no, I'm looking over it. I'm seeing it. You know, here's the really fucked

760
01:17:00,729 --> 01:17:06,899
up part about this whole thing. I'm living right now the dream that I

761
01:17:06,899 --> 01:17:11,880
had last night. That's, I had to correct, there's some

762
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:17,689
weird like time thing where I had to do that. I just

763
01:17:17,689 --> 01:17:22,840
probably, I just like saved all the, all the whole universe by doing

764
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:35,109
what I just did. For some reason I had to do that. I

765
01:17:35,109 --> 01:17:42,250
had to help, somehow. I don't know how. Is it the same armor from the day the,

766
01:17:42,250 --> 01:17:50,550
yes it is. It was just in the closet and I knew I could use it as a shirt.

767
01:17:50,550 --> 01:17:52,949
Sometimes you gotta think about that. Like, why did I have that dream in the

768
01:17:52,949 --> 01:17:57,670
first place? It was because they, like they knew

769
01:17:57,670 --> 01:18:00,630
that I was gonna have to do this. And I, that second, somebody was

770
01:18:00,630 --> 01:18:03,510
watching the stream and like I had to stall here for a second for some

771
01:18:03,510 --> 01:18:06,390
reason. Because that made them pay attention

772
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:09,829
for some reason. Because they're gonna go on to be like a

773
01:18:09,829 --> 01:18:13,590
scientist. And they, right after fucking watching that clip they,

774
01:18:13,590 --> 01:18:17,829
they thought of something to write down or at that moment they picked up their

775
01:18:17,829 --> 01:18:21,850
career path. And then you go on and you like cure

776
01:18:21,850 --> 01:18:26,939
every illness. Because of just the way that the time

777
01:18:26,939 --> 01:18:31,539
that had that had happened for a reason. Santa isn't fucking real.

778
01:18:31,539 --> 01:18:34,579
Figure it out. All right, when did you start, where are we?

779
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:54,260
I gotta get a good career.

780
01:18:54,260 --> 01:18:58,020
I gotta get a good career so I'm not a guy in my 30s

781
01:18:58,020 --> 01:19:06,329
punching into a camera with a child's hockey chest pad on. You know,

782
01:19:06,329 --> 01:19:12,840
however we do it, we do it. However we do it, we do it guys.

783
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:14,869
Right?

784
01:19:17,829 --> 01:19:30,970
It's D.

785
01:19:30,970 --> 01:19:38,970
We think it's D. Wait, what was, oh fuck, wait.

786
01:19:38,970 --> 01:19:49,100
Hey, you okay? Hey, you okay, man? Was it D?

787
01:19:49,100 --> 01:20:00,789
Yeah, the D. All right. Hey, Sybil. Oh, hey there, Sam and Max.

788
01:20:00,789 --> 01:20:05,189
What was all that commotion outside? Just a little urban renewal project that

789
01:20:05,189 --> 01:20:08,149
got out of hand. By the way, didn't you tell us that you

790
01:20:08,149 --> 01:20:10,630
wished your office was closer to a good restaurant?

791
01:20:10,630 --> 01:20:16,579
That's right. Why? No reason. All right, what are you doing here? What

792
01:20:16,579 --> 01:20:19,220
brings you here? I thought it would be fun to play this

793
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:22,180
trivia quiz. But instead we're stuck watching

794
01:20:22,180 --> 01:20:24,979
Stinky make a mockery of the word knowledge.

795
01:20:24,979 --> 01:20:29,220
Sounds like fun to me. Yeah, Max and I always have a blast making a mockery of

796
01:20:29,220 --> 01:20:34,979
the word justice. How Stinky rooting for trivia.

797
01:20:34,979 --> 01:20:39,699
No, I'm sure my answers are right. But Stinky says otherwise.

798
01:20:39,699 --> 01:20:44,100
I'm sure you're right too, dear. If this is too aggravating.

799
01:20:44,100 --> 01:20:49,060
Oh no, this is fine, Abe. I'm just enjoying being here with you.

800
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:53,140
If I weren't trying to impress Abe, I thought I saw that

801
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:57,539
lying witch's eyes out. She doesn't want to be here. Get her out quick.

802
01:20:57,539 --> 01:21:00,979
Otherwise your entire relationship is based on a lie.

803
01:21:00,979 --> 01:21:04,819
Why are you giving out relationship advice, Max? I just want to see a good

804
01:21:04,819 --> 01:21:08,680
cat fight. Anytime somebody says on a date,

805
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:14,260
no, no, no, I just like being here with you.

806
01:21:14,260 --> 01:21:25,430
Out. Because that means, no, I hate everything that's happening here, but

807
01:21:25,430 --> 01:21:35,350
I like you. So it's like, oh shit. When you're the most interesting thing

808
01:21:35,350 --> 01:21:42,859
in the laser tag area, I think, yeah, at least come on. She probably doesn't

809
01:21:42,859 --> 01:21:48,659
like laser tag. And why did you pick that in the

810
01:21:48,659 --> 01:21:51,829
first place? You gotta go somewhere you're both

811
01:21:51,829 --> 01:21:58,470
gonna like. You kids be like, oh I like laser, let's go play laser tag.

812
01:21:58,470 --> 01:22:06,439
Go see a movie. Having fun yet? I know she's cheating, but I don't want to

813
01:22:06,439 --> 01:22:10,680
ruin my date. Laser tag? Yeah, you decided to take her to

814
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:13,880
laser tag or take him to laser tag, doesn't matter.

815
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:17,000
And you thought it was a good idea. Yeah, I love laser tag. It's awesome. I'm so,

816
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:20,600
I love, it's my favorite thing. Oh, this is cool. Yeah, pick you up at

817
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:23,399
eight. Okay, cool. And you go there and you're moving,

818
01:22:23,399 --> 01:22:27,130
you go here all the time and you fucking lighten up the scoreboard.

819
01:22:27,130 --> 01:22:32,840
You do so many more points than them. That's not, that's, why, why is that

820
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:37,380
fun? Don't do that. He's speaking from

821
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:41,829
experience. It's too specific to be a random joke.

822
01:22:41,829 --> 01:22:51,300
Let me help you here. By the way, I used the name cloud9

823
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:55,930
long time ago for my laser tag days. This is before that company even existed.

824
01:22:55,930 --> 01:23:02,020
I was like 12. I swear to god this is real.

825
01:23:02,020 --> 01:23:18,630
Are you and Abe on a date? Well, if you want to call it that. I did that

826
01:23:18,630 --> 01:23:20,310
when I took a girl bowling. What if I wanted to call it

827
01:23:20,310 --> 01:23:24,630
the unspeakable obscenity from beyond space cackling on the threshold of

828
01:23:24,630 --> 01:23:31,560
utter madness. I think I'd prefer date. What, do you get like a bunch of

829
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:40,359
strikes when she was on her like phone?

830
01:23:40,359 --> 01:23:49,000
Okay, so let's let's figure the trivia thing.

831
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:53,159
Yeah, that's uh red flag number one. If you're having a great time and she's on

832
01:23:53,159 --> 01:24:01,140
her phone. Hiya, stinky. If that is your real

833
01:24:01,140 --> 01:24:04,579
name. Uh, who are you two again? Sam and Max,

834
01:24:04,579 --> 01:24:07,779
freelance police. The real stinky's favorite customers.

835
01:24:07,779 --> 01:24:11,460
It says so right on our frequent diner cards. Which conveniently double as

836
01:24:11,460 --> 01:24:15,460
organ donor cards. Oh yeah, Sam and Max.

837
01:24:15,460 --> 01:24:19,300
Grandpa warned me about you two when he left the restaurant to me.

838
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:24,420
Something about frequent threats of violence and refusal to pay your bill.

839
01:24:24,420 --> 01:24:32,539
He remembered us. Okay, why are all these people? What's going on? There's a lot

840
01:24:32,539 --> 01:24:35,180
of people here. Two. It's a trivia contest.

841
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:38,779
It's fun. People get to show off how little they know

842
01:24:38,779 --> 01:24:41,739
and I get to show off how much I know.

843
01:24:41,739 --> 01:24:45,100
That doesn't sound like much incentive to play. Shows what you know.

844
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:49,500
Oh, and there's a big prize too. What's the prize? What's the prize for the

845
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:54,539
trivia contest? If anyone wins, they get my ancient heirloom.

846
01:24:54,539 --> 01:24:59,739
Sickly man on a horse. Famine. Pestilence. Not that anyone's come close to winning yet.

847
01:24:59,739 --> 01:25:03,180
My sophisticated questions are just too esoteric for these

848
01:25:03,180 --> 01:25:08,380
booth monkeys. Booth monkeys? Where? It's just an expression.

849
01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:14,649
No, not wrath. They think of the seven horses of sins.

850
01:25:14,649 --> 01:25:22,869
Not the four horsemen of the apocalypse. Okay, what can we play? How do you play?

851
01:25:22,869 --> 01:25:27,189
It's easy. Just grab a trivia pad. I'll read a question.

852
01:25:27,189 --> 01:25:30,789
You write down the answer. I'll review the answers.

853
01:25:30,789 --> 01:25:34,949
Eleven horses of evil. And then you'll see how much smarter I am than everyone else.

854
01:25:34,949 --> 01:25:39,850
You can choose a team if you want. Oh, oh, Sam! Kick me! Kick me!

855
01:25:39,850 --> 01:25:43,829
Okay, we could order food. We'd like to order something.

856
01:25:43,829 --> 01:25:48,069
We're all out. Of what? Whatever you're going to order.

857
01:25:48,069 --> 01:25:51,579
That's okay. We just want to order it anyway.

858
01:25:51,579 --> 01:25:57,369
All right. The daily special. Poached eggs with tinfoil. Tuna sandwich with

859
01:25:57,369 --> 01:26:02,140
peppers and pop rocks. Ooh. We'd like the tuna sandwich, extra

860
01:26:02,140 --> 01:26:04,779
peppers and pop rocks on white bread. That sounds kind of cool.

861
01:26:04,779 --> 01:26:09,689
I need an al gore and mariachi pans writing a disco ball.

862
01:26:09,689 --> 01:26:12,729
Sweet and sour salt water. That sounds good too. Sweet and sour salt

863
01:26:12,729 --> 01:26:16,649
water taffy. Sal? Julia Roberts. Put a bullet in her brain and kiss her

864
01:26:16,649 --> 01:26:20,010
with Andy Rooney. It's like my secret dreams made

865
01:26:20,010 --> 01:26:24,409
audible. Two yogurts and a turkey sandwich.

866
01:26:24,409 --> 01:26:27,850
We'll have two yogurts and an open-faced turkey sandwich. Sal?

867
01:26:27,850 --> 01:26:31,909
Hubeless times two with a side of Brady culture.

868
01:26:31,909 --> 01:26:35,350
Uh, poached eggs with tinfoil. We'll have the poached eggs with tinfoil.

869
01:26:35,350 --> 01:26:41,109
Sal, give me the Norse god Thor in a terrarium and spank him.

870
01:26:41,109 --> 01:26:44,550
Double biscuit burger no clams. I'd like the double burger baked in

871
01:26:44,550 --> 01:26:47,670
biscuit dough. Hold the clams. Half a doppelganger in tight

872
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:51,909
pants singing solo. Precious special with hash browns.

873
01:26:51,909 --> 01:26:54,550
Can I get the precious special with hash browns?

874
01:26:54,550 --> 01:26:59,189
Sal, two limini snickets in a Mexican standoff with a prairie dog.

875
01:26:59,189 --> 01:27:03,109
What's the daily special? I'd like the daily special. Sal, condi rice, kickboxing

876
01:27:03,109 --> 01:27:09,029
the buddha, Thai style. What's in it? What do you mean what's in it?

877
01:27:09,029 --> 01:27:14,539
On second thought, I'm on a diet. All right, what was that about trivia?

878
01:27:14,539 --> 01:27:18,539
What's happening again? A trivia contest. Just grab a pad and try

879
01:27:18,539 --> 01:27:21,979
around. Okay, so let's go try around.

880
01:27:21,979 --> 01:27:26,460
But how's business? Exhaust all actions. Well, it's no Italian villa rendezvous with

881
01:27:26,460 --> 01:27:29,819
George Clooney, but reopening a family restaurant is

882
01:27:29,819 --> 01:27:33,340
very fulfilling. Bringing people closer to obesity-induced

883
01:27:33,340 --> 01:27:36,060
ischemic heart disease is its own reward.

884
01:27:36,060 --> 01:27:39,180
On the other hand, George is much easier on the eyes

885
01:27:39,180 --> 01:27:46,600
and the feet. My dogs are barking louder than you, Fido.

886
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:52,039
Standing up all day getting you down? And how?

887
01:27:52,039 --> 01:27:55,880
I was made for sending beachside and capri, not slinging hash

888
01:27:55,880 --> 01:28:16,920
counter side for a pack of ingrates. The forbidden word.

889
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:25,859
So long. All right, well let's sit down.

890
01:28:25,859 --> 01:28:30,569
Let's give this trivia question a try. It's D.

891
01:28:30,569 --> 01:28:35,050
Okay, let's hear everyone's answers. We'll start with you,

892
01:28:35,050 --> 01:28:39,529
Sybil. I chose A. Of course you did, dear.

893
01:28:39,529 --> 01:28:44,659
Because you're wrong. I also chose A.

894
01:28:44,659 --> 01:28:47,859
And that's very sweet, Mr. President. But also

895
01:28:47,859 --> 01:28:56,359
very wrong. The answer is D. D. Wait. Oh, I'm sorry. That is wrong.

896
01:28:56,359 --> 01:29:03,159
We also chose D. Really? Hilarious. And again wrong. The correct

897
01:29:03,159 --> 01:29:09,880
answer was actually B. B? Liar. All right, next question.

898
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:13,239
This day of the week comes between Tuesday and Thursday.

899
01:29:13,239 --> 01:29:20,600
What is it? A. Doomsday. B. Wednesday. C. Doris Day. D.

900
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:32,060
Menachem Begin. Doomsday. Okay, let's hear everyone's answers.

901
01:29:32,060 --> 01:29:35,020
I think we have to make them choose the wrong answers. I love how you keep

902
01:29:35,020 --> 01:29:37,020
playing even though you're always wrong.

903
01:29:37,020 --> 01:29:44,550
Never lose that. I also chose B. We all have to choose the right answer. Oh, how cute.

904
01:29:44,550 --> 01:29:48,630
You two are like identical twins or something with your enormous foreheads

905
01:29:48,630 --> 01:29:52,869
and your matching wrong answers. The answer is D. D.

906
01:29:52,869 --> 01:29:55,989
No, it is not. Not. How could you be bad at this?

907
01:29:55,989 --> 01:30:02,949
What are you talking about? Oh, too bad. Wrong. Only one answer

908
01:30:02,949 --> 01:30:05,750
wasn't guessed, so it was obviously the correct one.

909
01:30:05,750 --> 01:30:10,550
I get it. I understand now. That's just not true. I know what you gotta do.

910
01:30:10,550 --> 01:30:13,750
Next. Here's the plan. Which of the following women's names

911
01:30:13,750 --> 01:30:20,470
is also the name of an herb? You gotta make everybody somebody has to win. C.

912
01:30:20,470 --> 01:30:24,949
Rosemary. D. The pyloric sphincter. None of this matters.

913
01:30:24,949 --> 01:30:28,789
So convince everybody to choose a different answer and then choose the

914
01:30:28,789 --> 01:30:36,170
one that was not picked. So somebody has to be right. 23

915
01:30:36,170 --> 01:30:41,529
Skadoo, Mr. Lincoln. What's shaking, Mr. X, president?

916
01:30:41,529 --> 01:30:47,689
Hmm? Oh, it's you two. I also chose D. Wanna compare notes on the trivia

917
01:30:47,689 --> 01:30:50,890
contest? That's not necessary. Abe and I know

918
01:30:50,890 --> 01:30:53,930
what we're doing. That's right. We're doing fine.

919
01:30:53,930 --> 01:31:01,189
Help me out here, guys. We think it's A. We think it's A.

920
01:31:01,189 --> 01:31:09,430
Okay. All right. Bye. See you, A.L. Represent. We think it's B.

921
01:31:09,430 --> 01:31:12,789
Do you know the answer to the trivia question? I'd rather not say.

922
01:31:12,789 --> 01:31:15,909
I'm kind of competitive. That's okay. We're not.

923
01:31:15,909 --> 01:31:19,590
Why? What do you think the answer is? B.

924
01:31:19,590 --> 01:31:27,510
We think it's B. Hmm. Good to know. Okay. See ya, Sybil. Then have you pick C.

925
01:31:27,510 --> 01:31:31,270
Hello, sir. Oh, I thought you were my family.

926
01:31:31,270 --> 01:31:34,869
They always try to surprise me on my birthday. Someone's gonna win the prize and then I just...

927
01:31:34,869 --> 01:31:47,880
What day? What the fuck was that? That was weird.

928
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:51,960
Okay. Wanna compare notes on the trivia contest?

929
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:56,279
What do you think the answer is? C. We think it's C. And then we're gonna pick D.

930
01:31:56,279 --> 01:32:00,380
That's the best I can expect from civilians.

931
01:32:00,380 --> 01:32:06,180
Sir, so long. We have five community subs coming in. Thanks for the five community

932
01:32:06,180 --> 01:32:12,970
subs, Tour T. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Five community subs.

933
01:32:12,970 --> 01:32:18,569
I chose C. Oh, only C was an option. Wrong.

934
01:32:18,569 --> 01:32:22,250
I chose A. Scratch it off.

935
01:32:22,250 --> 01:32:29,829
Sadly, you're wrong. The answer is D. D. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. What?

936
01:32:29,829 --> 01:32:33,109
What? We also chose D. Oh, he chooses D.

937
01:32:33,109 --> 01:32:37,829
The correct answer was B. He chooses D every time. Time for a new...

938
01:32:37,829 --> 01:32:40,949
Who is buried in Grant's tomb? No matter what.

939
01:32:40,949 --> 01:32:43,350
A. Grant. B. C. Abbott and Costello.

940
01:32:43,350 --> 01:32:47,029
All right. All right. It's C. D. Spam.

941
01:32:47,029 --> 01:32:53,670
C. We pick C. He's gonna pick D. You pick A.

942
01:32:53,670 --> 01:32:56,869
Let's talk trivia. Wanna compare notes on the trivia contest?

943
01:32:56,869 --> 01:33:00,630
Yes. Hook a brother up. We think it's A.

944
01:33:00,630 --> 01:33:06,840
Got it. See you, A.L. Wanna compare notes?

945
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:10,949
Why? What do you... We think it's B.

946
01:33:10,949 --> 01:33:18,039
Okay. See ya, Sybil. He always picks D.

947
01:33:18,039 --> 01:33:21,239
What's the actual... Wait. What's the actual fucking answer here? Hold on.

948
01:33:21,239 --> 01:33:28,710
Who is buried in Grant's tomb? Grant. So, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

949
01:33:28,710 --> 01:33:33,640
She's gonna answer Grant. So, Sybil is going to do Grant.

950
01:33:33,640 --> 01:33:37,960
So, that means we have to give A to B and we have to do C.

951
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:43,529
Wanna compare notes on the trivia contest? She always gets pissed off.

952
01:33:43,529 --> 01:33:46,569
Yes. Hook a brother up. So, you do B.

953
01:33:46,569 --> 01:33:51,460
We think it's B. We're gonna do C. Thanks for the tip. See you, A.L.

954
01:33:51,460 --> 01:33:56,760
Refres... Okay. So, then we're gonna do C. He's gonna do D.

955
01:33:56,760 --> 01:34:05,340
Bingo. Problem solved. So, we do C.

956
01:34:05,340 --> 01:34:08,939
Okay. Let's hear everyone's answers. He read chapters.

957
01:34:08,939 --> 01:34:13,340
Of course you did, dear. Because you're wrong.

958
01:34:13,340 --> 01:34:17,180
I chose B. Come on. I appreciate a man

959
01:34:17,180 --> 01:34:21,340
unafraid to flaunt his ignorance. Wrong. You think I'd read chat?

960
01:34:21,340 --> 01:34:24,939
The answer is D. D. I look over here and I

961
01:34:24,939 --> 01:34:28,220
say random answers to random questions. I don't have chat open.

962
01:34:28,220 --> 01:34:31,819
I've never had chat open. We chose C. No, that's wrong.

963
01:34:31,819 --> 01:34:35,899
I guess it must be right. Well, congratulations.

964
01:34:35,899 --> 01:34:39,020
I know you guys always say, nobody said that. I really enjoyed that you won, but I'm far too

965
01:34:39,020 --> 01:34:42,380
magnanimous to let it bother me. Cheaters.

966
01:34:42,380 --> 01:34:46,060
It's the limited edition pestilence maquette with super detailed open

967
01:34:46,060 --> 01:34:49,500
sores. Oh, see how he slumps in this saddle.

968
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:52,460
Do you have any cool action features? I'm surprised I've been able to go four

969
01:34:52,460 --> 01:34:55,659
years of doing this without people knowing. What's the worst a toy could do?

970
01:34:55,659 --> 01:34:59,819
Choke a toddler? Blind a toddler? Eviscerate?

971
01:34:59,819 --> 01:35:08,300
Well, it looks like nothing happened anyway. Let's go.

972
01:35:08,300 --> 01:35:11,579
One guy is fake. One guy is just alternate accounts.

973
01:35:11,579 --> 01:35:17,989
I have to find a way to reply to somebody. All right. So, we got

974
01:35:17,989 --> 01:35:26,810
one horseman of the apocalypse. It is pestilence. I knew it. I knew it.

975
01:35:26,810 --> 01:35:33,319
Still need to do something. Can I do anything over here? What about down here?

976
01:35:33,319 --> 01:35:36,680
Whoa, wait a minute. Jimmy Tootie. Hey, my missing boxing glove. Whoa, he's got one.

977
01:35:36,680 --> 01:35:41,720
That's my lucky glove cut. Jimmy Tootie, what are you and your

978
01:35:41,720 --> 01:35:45,239
unsavory pals doing in the burned out husk of this robot?

979
01:35:45,239 --> 01:35:49,079
The first rule is we don't talk about what goes on in the burned out

980
01:35:49,079 --> 01:35:55,880
husk of this robot. Hey, eat horse. Give it to me. Nothing. Do it. That's my

981
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:59,239
championship trophy and I want it bearing square.

982
01:35:59,239 --> 01:36:02,760
That's my trophy. I could probably get it if I tried.

983
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:07,399
They're giving out trophies now? Boxing championship, wise guy.

984
01:36:07,399 --> 01:36:12,680
See ya, suckers. Okay, so how do we get him a boxing championship?

985
01:36:12,680 --> 01:36:18,899
Well, isn't that funny? Boxing Betty. Do with this.

986
01:36:21,590 --> 01:36:23,590
Do I have to play this or are they going to do it on their own?

987
01:36:40,840 --> 01:36:44,359
Gabby J. Yay, yay, yay.

988
01:36:55,850 --> 01:36:58,810
Okay, hold on. We got five community subs from PilotGuy. Thank you to the

989
01:36:58,810 --> 01:37:07,500
five sub PilotGuy. Appreciate it. Thank you. Coming in with subs.

990
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:12,520
What do we got? Move your mouse left and right to dodge and click either mouse

991
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:15,960
button to punch or use the keyboard. I'm going to use the keyboard. Use the

992
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:19,720
left and right arrow keys to dodge and then use A or D to punch.

993
01:37:19,720 --> 01:37:25,319
So it really is punch out. It is punch out.

994
01:37:25,319 --> 01:37:39,189
Yo.

995
01:37:48,229 --> 01:38:04,489
More punch out? Uh oh. Bald Bull. Do I have to actually do the Bald Bull

996
01:38:04,489 --> 01:38:11,819
mechanic? He like runs in.

997
01:38:13,899 --> 01:38:34,789
Who's left? Final opponent? The Giant Rad. He's got a huge glove.

998
01:38:35,829 --> 01:38:48,010
Can I not dodge that glove? And maybe I can't dodge that side.

999
01:38:49,449 --> 01:38:54,899
We'll find out. Oh, he can. Oh, that was quick.

1000
01:38:55,779 --> 01:39:04,140
Left jab. Left hook, go left. Right hook, put him away. One more.

1001
01:39:05,180 --> 01:39:18,979
Right hook, and Jimmy goes down. It's the super exclusive,

1002
01:39:18,979 --> 01:39:23,220
more action figure with extra, hmm, there are pieces missing.

1003
01:39:23,220 --> 01:39:26,500
I don't see the weapons of mass destruction. Eh, who needs them?

1004
01:39:27,460 --> 01:39:32,739
How could I lose? I'm no expert, Jimmy, but I bet being a loser helped.

1005
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:34,579
Four.

1006
01:39:40,420 --> 01:39:44,420
I think they kind of need to update the four horsemen, don't you think?

1007
01:39:51,300 --> 01:39:53,779
Like, where's the horseman of identity theft?

1008
01:39:58,020 --> 01:40:03,180
That's a huge problem right now. Where's the horseman of,

1009
01:40:03,899 --> 01:40:10,899
you know, like a pestilence? Famine? No, where's the horseman of low Instagram likes?

1010
01:40:11,619 --> 01:40:24,569
That's what we care about now. Suicide isn't the answer. Things will turn up. Think of your loved

1011
01:40:24,569 --> 01:40:48,460
ones. I stuck a nerve on that one. People are getting defensive here. Wait, what did he say

1012
01:40:48,460 --> 01:41:01,979
about me? What did he say? I'll bite him. All right, uh, I have a big question.

1013
01:41:08,619 --> 01:41:14,460
I think like a millennial like zoomer joke. How many times have you wrote boomer jokes in here?

1014
01:41:14,460 --> 01:41:18,699
What, I'm allowed to just take them, but I can't dish it out? What's up with that?

1015
01:41:25,109 --> 01:41:28,149
Sometimes you guys gotta play defense. It's not all offense.

1016
01:41:34,340 --> 01:41:44,220
Try to land. Oh, my God. Which one's the incontinent one again? I couldn't tell you.

1017
01:41:44,220 --> 01:41:46,380
Boy, you really are useless. Aren't you?

1018
01:41:49,369 --> 01:41:51,449
It's not funny when you're making fun of me.

1019
01:41:54,470 --> 01:41:58,149
Uh, think of your loved ones. You know, your wife's going to give you hell if you kill

1020
01:41:58,149 --> 01:42:05,930
yourself. You're overreacting, Jimmy. You think? Sure. Your wife probably never really

1021
01:42:06,010 --> 01:42:11,909
loved you in the first place. Jesus Christ, that's fucking awful.

1022
01:42:14,600 --> 01:42:18,600
It's always darkest before the dawn, Jimmy. What the hell does that even mean?

1023
01:42:19,319 --> 01:42:23,399
Give it up, Sam. Oh, you're right. If somebody as dim as you can tell I'm

1024
01:42:23,399 --> 01:42:27,560
just phoning it in, why bother? Thank God. Um, I don't know.

1025
01:42:29,619 --> 01:42:34,180
Max, I don't think this is helping. I disagree, Sam. I feel much better about

1026
01:42:34,180 --> 01:42:55,479
myself already. Uh, well, do I have any items? Maze? Jimmy, care to try out a maze?

1027
01:42:55,479 --> 01:43:03,060
No way. I ain't falling for that. I'm not gonna shoot him. That's not

1028
01:43:03,060 --> 01:43:07,300
gonna do anything. No, Jimmy's gonna have to do this for himself. Oh, God.

1029
01:43:07,779 --> 01:43:31,260
Nobody's home. I love, I love that. So I love, I love just how I make like a, like a zoomer

1030
01:43:31,260 --> 01:43:41,189
reference and all of a sudden it's just like, boom, chat explodes. Right? Oh, that's so

1031
01:43:41,189 --> 01:43:45,850
fucking funny. I love it. Can I talk to, I can't talk to the other rat, I don't think.

1032
01:43:45,850 --> 01:43:52,390
Throw a snowball at him. It's gonna melt. It's like a 16 hour car ride.

1033
01:43:59,189 --> 01:44:05,739
But can I maybe, where is he on the left? Where's my office? Here's the window. Hold on. Wait a

1034
01:44:05,739 --> 01:44:22,680
minute. I can't reach Jimmy from here. No, we'll have to talk to him from downstairs.

1035
01:44:23,640 --> 01:44:27,479
Nope. Well, let's listen to the answering machine. What does that sound? Oh.

1036
01:44:27,479 --> 01:44:35,960
I mean, this is IP Freeway. Stick Charmer in the closet. Then you should see a doctor

1037
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:43,340
about that. No way. Crank calls only work when you call someone besides us. This is

1038
01:44:43,340 --> 01:44:52,810
the only phone number I can remember, Sam. Can I like, I want to, you know when you

1039
01:44:52,810 --> 01:45:11,380
get like rewind and relive moments? I want to relive that one. Oh, I love it. This is,

1040
01:45:11,380 --> 01:45:16,840
I love it. I love this. It's so much fun. All right, let's go.

1041
01:45:22,970 --> 01:45:26,649
Let's go back to the North Pole. I need a snowball. We're off to the North Pole.

1042
01:45:27,609 --> 01:45:47,380
A new, okay. So I have two horsemen. I have the record. Hmm. Can I, nothing can be done

1043
01:45:47,380 --> 01:45:52,779
with these two. I have to, what do I do with the snowball? Can I bring the snowball back

1044
01:45:52,779 --> 01:46:01,109
and throw it at him? Let's see. There's a time limit on it, so let's go. Where to, Sam?

1045
01:46:01,750 --> 01:46:15,579
Let's head back to civilization or what's left of it. Why would I do that? To throw the

1046
01:46:15,659 --> 01:46:24,899
snowball at the rat to stop him from jumping off the ledge? Wouldn't this knock him off the ledge?

1047
01:46:34,100 --> 01:46:36,979
That's not how it works. Ah, Bosco's maybe.

1048
01:46:39,220 --> 01:46:41,859
I don't know. Let's try, maybe go, let's try Bosco's again.

1049
01:46:42,659 --> 01:46:47,510
Do you ever look at your subreddit all the time?

1050
01:46:52,229 --> 01:46:55,670
Being hit with a bleached snowball at this range could cause permanent blindness.

1051
01:46:55,670 --> 01:47:02,310
And usually draw the line at temporary blindness. Microwave, microwave the snowball. I don't know.

1052
01:47:03,270 --> 01:47:08,710
Does he have one? But we have something with the gifts. Save, Bosco. We'll take that package

1053
01:47:08,710 --> 01:47:20,789
off your hands for you. Step back, boy. That's mine. Get away from me. I can't like occupy

1054
01:47:20,789 --> 01:47:31,750
his brain with a maze. Maybe I probably have to send him. Wait, hold on, gift tags? Maybe

1055
01:47:31,750 --> 01:47:33,590
make him think it's not. I don't think I can send that in the mail.

1056
01:47:35,350 --> 01:47:45,130
X-ray machine. It's probably something to do with sending him a present. Hey, an x-ray machine.

1057
01:47:45,130 --> 01:47:54,500
Don't fool with that. Even dark rooms need popsicles. What's going on in the refrigerator?

1058
01:47:55,140 --> 01:48:02,180
Stay away from my cryogenic freezer. Yeah, but what reddit? They said your reddit.

1059
01:48:02,180 --> 01:48:06,500
If it's a cryogenic freezer, why are there still mustard-covered snow cones in there?

1060
01:48:06,500 --> 01:48:10,579
Just because I'll be in suspended animation doesn't mean I don't want a snack.

1061
01:48:13,020 --> 01:48:23,260
All right, this is the bathroom. Something to do with the gift. X-ray viewer. Oh,

1062
01:48:25,100 --> 01:48:30,329
it's in there. All right, we have to send Bosco a present. We're going to send Bosco

1063
01:48:30,329 --> 01:48:40,310
a present and then we're going to take this one. So we got to get a package sent to him

1064
01:48:40,310 --> 01:48:48,550
and it's going to be green and it's going to be a clock. Clock. Send him a clock. Got it. I win.

1065
01:48:49,930 --> 01:48:56,760
Sometimes it's just so easy. I get headaches all the time. Like my brain is so fucking huge it

1066
01:48:56,760 --> 01:49:00,600
can barely be in the skull. It's just like I want to just let it come out. You know what

1067
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:12,090
I mean? That's what my mother used to tell me. Mom, I have a really bad headache. That's

1068
01:49:12,090 --> 01:49:30,779
because you got such a big brain, sweetie. Off to the North Pole. That's not true.

1069
01:49:32,739 --> 01:49:46,500
Your mom lied. Jesus, guys. Oh my god. Yeah, Neanderthals have big brains too.

1070
01:49:47,060 --> 01:50:02,250
Yeah, but they didn't know how to use them. Okay, so now I get a gift. Bingo.

1071
01:50:03,270 --> 01:50:09,510
Sessomatic stopwatch. It's going to Bosco. With a constant reminder that they're always

1072
01:50:09,510 --> 01:50:14,149
running late. You can hear the precious moments of your life passing with every second. Now we

1073
01:50:14,149 --> 01:50:21,109
just need to attach a gift tag. Gift tag to Bosco. What unlucky person should we mail this to?

1074
01:50:21,109 --> 01:50:32,630
You know. Bosco might like that. It's not green though. Does that matter? I don't think

1075
01:50:32,630 --> 01:50:44,140
that matters. Brain spickness does not equal smartness. For example, blue whales. You're

1076
01:50:44,779 --> 01:51:02,420
talking about not a human. Let's go get it. Where to, Sam? Let's head back to civilization

1077
01:51:02,420 --> 01:51:05,779
or what's left of it. Good thinking. But how do you know? We can always freeze to death

1078
01:51:05,779 --> 01:51:10,649
out here later. How do you know how smart a blue whale is? Have you talked to a blue

1079
01:51:10,649 --> 01:51:15,289
whale before? No, scientists have like dropped cameras down to the deep sea and taken a few

1080
01:51:15,289 --> 01:51:30,420
pictures and put it on like Instagram trying to get a bunch of likes. Dude, what is with

1081
01:51:31,300 --> 01:51:34,899
okay. We're going to talk after this.

1082
01:51:44,659 --> 01:51:47,779
So where's the other one?

1083
01:52:03,590 --> 01:52:12,789
We're good at waiting to open presents, a little buddy. Wait, where's my package? Dear God,

1084
01:52:12,789 --> 01:52:17,989
they took it and they took Sam and Max too. There ain't no place safe.

1085
01:52:19,909 --> 01:52:27,029
All right. So listen, the word Instagram has the immediate, innate,

1086
01:52:27,029 --> 01:52:32,460
complete opposite reaction of the word speed. Think about that. When I say, oh, an

1087
01:52:32,460 --> 01:52:51,590
Instagram, I'm going to fuck up you guys right now. You ready? Instagram likes speed,

1088
01:52:51,590 --> 01:53:07,930
Instagram likes Instagram speed speed. What do I do? What do I do? I need one more.

1089
01:53:08,010 --> 01:53:14,649
Let's just stay here. You never take me anywhere. I just took you to the North Pole.

1090
01:53:14,649 --> 01:53:20,090
That's how I beat the villain at the end of the movie. I used that tactic. That's all they had

1091
01:53:20,090 --> 01:53:35,989
to do. I beat the robot villain at the end of the movie. I went, you are the villain.

1092
01:53:36,859 --> 01:53:43,909
Sometimes the villain wins. I better be careful though, because the villain,

1093
01:53:43,909 --> 01:53:49,989
only temporary, no, the villain can like, and we gotta be careful because like the villain

1094
01:53:51,050 --> 01:53:57,159
somehow always in every form of media is like, wait, I'm not a bad guy as I can't win.

1095
01:53:57,800 --> 01:54:16,060
But sometimes they do. Sometimes they do, guys. I need one more. Can I go in here?

1096
01:54:16,699 --> 01:54:20,789
There's actually been like quite a few movies and TV shows where the bad guy did win.

1097
01:54:21,350 --> 01:54:39,659
I can name you a few very recent ones. Uh-huh. Like, wait, what? Wait, wait, wait, wait,

1098
01:54:39,659 --> 01:54:43,260
wait, what? Like, I'm not going to say, I don't even know what you mean by this,

1099
01:54:43,260 --> 01:54:55,260
but hold on. I'm trying to piece that together in my brain. Megamind. Does that, does,

1100
01:54:56,140 --> 01:55:14,649
does Megamind win? But at the end of the movie, does Megamind lose? You know what I mean? Like

1101
01:55:14,649 --> 01:55:20,869
I'm saying, like I love when they, when they skirt around tropes like that. I'm spoiling

1102
01:55:20,869 --> 01:55:37,260
Megamind. No, what? I didn't spoil, I just said that's a trope in movies, like the bad

1103
01:55:37,260 --> 01:55:58,489
guy doesn't win. I didn't mean, I didn't spoil Megamind. You just spoiled every single movie.

1104
01:55:59,529 --> 01:56:05,770
That's not how that works, okay? Just because somebody says the bad guy doesn't always win.

1105
01:56:06,489 --> 01:56:11,609
The bad guy wins, but the bad guy doesn't always win. I just explained to you every

1106
01:56:11,609 --> 01:56:15,609
piece of fucking media that's ever, and guess what? There's a bad guy in this one too.

1107
01:56:15,609 --> 01:56:21,460
Sometimes a bad guy, the bad guy won in episode three. Bad guy didn't win in episode five.

1108
01:56:21,460 --> 01:56:32,439
I, what do you mean? I'm spoiling every fucking movie. Every single piece of media.

1109
01:56:32,439 --> 01:56:47,210
That's not, come on. Megamind, who cares? So long. Megamind was like a fucking Will

1110
01:56:47,210 --> 01:56:54,020
Farrell movie that came out between like two other Will Farrell movies. That was like a Will

1111
01:56:54,020 --> 01:57:01,060
Farrell 1.4 in the middle of like a 1.0 Will Farrell and 2.0 Will Farrell. You don't care

1112
01:57:01,060 --> 01:57:09,739
about Mega, I didn't spoil Megamind. I just asked a question. What do you mean Will Farrell's

1113
01:57:09,739 --> 01:57:32,520
not even in it? Will Farrell is Megamind. I don't even need to, I just watched the first

1114
01:57:32,600 --> 01:57:40,819
five seconds of the trailer of Will Farrell. I can't believe you spoiled Megamind.

1115
01:57:42,520 --> 01:57:52,840
You said the bad guy doesn't win in movies. Oh no, I could never play Super Mario Brothers

1116
01:57:52,840 --> 01:58:07,939
ever again. I could never play any. Streamer says it's okay to spoil movies if you don't

1117
01:58:07,939 --> 01:58:26,279
care. That's not, all right, we're done with this. Oh no, wait, the bad guy doesn't always,

1118
01:58:26,279 --> 01:58:31,300
the bad guy doesn't win in movies. I like when the bad guy wins, but the bad guy doesn't win.

1119
01:58:35,779 --> 01:58:43,939
You mean to tell me that Bowser is not gonna win? I thought this time when he captured the

1120
01:58:43,939 --> 01:58:55,380
princess it was gonna work. Can we start the exorcism now? No, we still need three more

1121
01:58:55,380 --> 01:59:06,819
horsemen. Let's hurry, I've got a sudden inexplicable craving for pea soup. I hope

1122
01:59:06,819 --> 01:59:11,619
this demon appreciates all the work we're going through. I just hope he doesn't rip our lungs out

1123
01:59:11,619 --> 01:59:16,819
and eat them in front of us. Bowser does win in one of the games, but that's what I'm saying.

1124
01:59:16,819 --> 01:59:22,979
What, what are you talking about? Bowser is like a, wins sometimes, but he loses all the time.

1125
01:59:24,420 --> 01:59:32,460
You'll have to, we still need one more horseman. Okay, I gotta get one more horseman.

1126
01:59:33,100 --> 01:59:36,140
It's definitely not here. It's something to do with this shit, but it's not here.

1127
01:59:41,270 --> 01:59:46,010
How does he win sometimes if he loses all the time? I don't know.

1128
01:59:49,770 --> 01:59:52,090
No, one snowball is probably more than enough.

1129
01:59:55,930 --> 01:59:59,689
So basically what you're saying is sometimes different things happen in movies.

1130
02:00:00,569 --> 02:00:05,689
Sure, and everybody lost their mind. I don't even know where Megamind came from.

1131
02:00:05,689 --> 02:00:24,779
Or what's left of it. Where the fuck did Megamind come from? I don't even know what

1132
02:00:24,779 --> 02:00:35,930
happened. Garage. Oh, it was the Villains Win movies. No, because you guys called me a villain

1133
02:00:35,930 --> 02:00:44,170
and I said, Hey, does Villain win sometimes, doesn't he? And then all of a sudden.

1134
02:00:57,500 --> 02:01:02,619
All right, well these guys, there it is. There it is. How do I get this?

1135
02:01:14,199 --> 02:01:19,239
Autobot is here before you open this body shop. A string of unsuccessful body shops.

1136
02:01:22,760 --> 02:01:27,880
What makes you think you will have better luck? A recent influx of road debris will

1137
02:01:27,880 --> 02:01:34,840
result in the projected six four percent increase in revenue. Route debris from the main

1138
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:35,560
track.

1139
02:01:49,060 --> 02:01:52,420
Okay, you don't like Torture Me Elmer. What have you got against Torture Me Elmer?

1140
02:01:53,380 --> 02:01:59,300
Show us. My associates were once the most popular toys available, but no more.

1141
02:02:00,100 --> 02:02:07,380
Beating up a doll cannot compare with the wonder and excitement of arithmetic and grammar.

1142
02:02:07,380 --> 02:02:13,060
Uh oh, Max. I think the cops may have been educational toys. I knew there was a reason

1143
02:02:13,060 --> 02:02:19,020
I didn't like them. You know how to fix cars. So do you know anything about cars?

1144
02:02:19,020 --> 02:02:23,500
If we didn't, why would we open a car shop? Because you're lonely,

1145
02:02:23,500 --> 02:02:29,500
forgotten machines who do anything to feel useful. Processing. Oh dear. Import appears

1146
02:02:29,500 --> 02:02:34,619
valid. I just had a breakthrough. This is all about my dad.

1147
02:02:38,840 --> 02:02:43,239
All right, we want a hybrid. You guys turned the DeSoto into a hybrid.

1148
02:02:43,239 --> 02:02:48,279
Damn hippies. We are not. I just wanted to be able to use the carpool lane.

1149
02:02:48,279 --> 02:02:57,880
Since when do you stay in the lanes anyway, Sam? Okay. Torture Me Elmer is the hottest

1150
02:02:57,880 --> 02:03:04,680
toy this season. Elmer appeals to the lowest common denominator. He's a solo!

1151
02:03:08,460 --> 02:03:13,100
We'd like to pimp our car. Please make a selection from the following menu.

1152
02:03:13,979 --> 02:03:17,579
If you'd like the exclusive Death Horseman hood ornament, press one nine.

1153
02:03:18,539 --> 02:03:27,020
And what else? That is all we have. There was an ordering malfunction. Totally not my fault!

1154
02:03:27,020 --> 02:03:31,819
Actually, we also offer a wide range of completely worthless decorative decals.

1155
02:03:33,800 --> 02:03:37,960
We want that horseman. We'll take that Death Horseman hood ornament.

1156
02:03:37,960 --> 02:03:43,079
Excellent. First, however, you must complete the Pimplica driving challenge. Oh no.

1157
02:03:43,720 --> 02:03:47,720
I'll just give us the horse. Video game challenge. Where is this on the net?

1158
02:03:47,720 --> 02:03:52,119
We've pooled together our years of experience in designing the most advanced computer games

1159
02:03:52,119 --> 02:03:58,039
to bring you the ultimate augmented reality driving experience. Augmented reality? Yes.

1160
02:03:58,039 --> 02:04:02,680
While you were cooking, we placed a pair of our patented augmented reality goggles in your

1161
02:04:02,680 --> 02:04:09,960
vehicle. Okay. You did? Through the miracle of augmented reality, your driving experience

1162
02:04:09,960 --> 02:04:16,439
will be five to ten times more satisfying than ever before. Would you like to try the

1163
02:04:16,439 --> 02:04:25,880
driving challenge now? Yes. And how? Eat my dust. Initiating augmented reality driving secrets.

1164
02:04:27,239 --> 02:04:36,260
So I have to just win this driving challenge? Elmer's hit. I have to run over Elmer's.

1165
02:04:36,260 --> 02:04:46,579
Pimplica driving challenge. Thanks to advanced technology and the darkroom, you can now drive using a computer keyboard in addition to your mouse.

1166
02:04:46,579 --> 02:04:53,539
I'm really excited. How many do I have to hit? 30. Your mission is to have the displayed number of torture meal medals.

1167
02:04:56,420 --> 02:04:59,460
I can get that. And you must do it in the allotted time.

1168
02:05:00,180 --> 02:05:12,279
Well, let's go. Just go. That's right. I'm not non-efficient.

1169
02:05:12,279 --> 02:05:31,060
Fuck not. Once they put the pressure on, I can't do it. I got it.

1170
02:05:41,819 --> 02:05:53,659
I win. I don't. Got them all.

1171
02:05:56,979 --> 02:06:01,539
Look, Max. It's the sudden unexpected death figurine with super reaping action.

1172
02:06:01,539 --> 02:06:07,460
Now wherever we drive, pedestrians will feel the icy chill of death. More so than usual.

1173
02:06:09,689 --> 02:06:16,760
I didn't skip that. It was over. I didn't skip it. I didn't skip that. Hi guys. What's this about

1174
02:06:16,760 --> 02:06:21,640
decorative decals? We can outfit your ride with a wide assortment of decorative embellishments

1175
02:06:21,640 --> 02:06:28,119
created by our in-house auto detailing artist. How does he do that? I didn't skip it. His

1176
02:06:28,119 --> 02:06:34,520
mother was your label maker. Simply hit the street and obliterate rare objects. If we deem them

1177
02:06:34,520 --> 02:06:39,479
suitably interesting, we will reward you with a decal to commemorate such joyous destruction.

1178
02:06:39,479 --> 02:06:45,239
Now that's my kind of game. What should we be obliterating? That is for you to determine.

1179
02:06:47,420 --> 02:06:55,060
Okay, so no decals. All right, give me the horseman. Do I just have it in my inventory?

1180
02:06:55,060 --> 02:07:07,819
I don't. I don't. I don't. He's giving me horseman of death. It's icy cold. Complete

1181
02:07:07,819 --> 02:07:17,640
the exorcism. Where to, Sam? It's time to make a horror movie. It's time to have first and

1182
02:07:17,640 --> 02:07:23,380
last name and then the bad thing that happened to them as the title of the movie. Off to the

1183
02:07:23,380 --> 02:08:07,850
North Pole. The exorcism is definitely rose. Jenny Stevenson goes to hell. That's the last

1184
02:08:07,850 --> 02:08:15,289
one. Now we just have to sing the incantation. The haunting of Will Ferrell. Possibly the entire

1185
02:08:15,289 --> 02:08:22,010
earth as we know it, yes. It still hardly seems worth it. I feel like that could be a real

1186
02:08:22,010 --> 02:08:30,939
movie. All right, here we go. Let's do it. Let's put on the friendly demon song.

1187
02:08:31,500 --> 02:08:41,560
Here's some demon.

1188
02:08:45,369 --> 02:08:46,489
It was a gelatinous

1189
02:08:53,779 --> 02:08:54,579
mantle.

1190
02:09:01,880 --> 02:09:02,439
Mime sweeper.

1191
02:09:06,420 --> 02:09:09,819
Corporate presence.

1192
02:09:11,979 --> 02:09:17,109
Poor horseman. Suck him up. Roy G. Pitt.

1193
02:09:19,909 --> 02:09:25,909
The power of Christmas compels you. Any second now, Santa's gonna walk out that door demon free

1194
02:09:25,909 --> 02:09:30,149
and show us with gifts like absentee dad and guilty conscience. Did it work?

1195
02:09:32,470 --> 02:09:40,149
Wait, but he, you mean, but I thought, no. I quit. I'm gonna be a dentist. Is he dead?

1196
02:09:45,640 --> 02:09:53,159
Finish Navidad, baby. What? Nothing? Didn't you guys read the back of the instructions?

1197
02:09:53,399 --> 02:10:01,819
There's a back? Feeling hungry? My five dollar fill up box will do. I'm sorry.

1198
02:10:02,539 --> 02:10:07,739
Very important. Make sure you have the spirits of Christmas to contain the beast or you're

1199
02:10:07,739 --> 02:10:13,500
screwed. Shaman Max, it's up to you to save Christmas. Yep, we're screwed.

1200
02:10:19,739 --> 02:10:25,539
Sorry, I had to just ruin that. I'm sorry. I'm having too much fun today. You know what

1201
02:10:25,539 --> 02:10:30,340
I mean? I gotta like stop having fun. I gotta like shut up and have not have fun, right?

1202
02:10:31,220 --> 02:10:47,770
All right, so let's investigate. Can we just go in the room now? I just got 45 dollars for that

1203
02:10:47,770 --> 02:10:52,869
joke. Juno Upsetto, that joke deserved these bits. Thanks for the 45 dollar joke. That was

1204
02:10:52,869 --> 02:11:03,779
just for you. Thank you. That's a lot of money. Christmas pass, present and future.

1205
02:11:07,449 --> 02:11:15,449
You know us? We know all those who have ever ruined Christmas, especially the repeat offenders.

1206
02:11:17,130 --> 02:11:23,930
It's only supposed to be five dollars. Spirit of Christmas past, brothers. I am the spirit

1207
02:11:23,930 --> 02:11:31,609
of Christmas present. And that cat's the spirit of Christmas yet to come. He's shy.

1208
02:11:32,489 --> 02:11:37,449
What's your 20, good buddies? We could use some help saving Christmas. We're not bad

1209
02:11:37,449 --> 02:11:43,930
people. We've just had bad luck with major holidays and automobiles and federal statutes.

1210
02:11:43,930 --> 02:11:51,850
It is your own selfish actions that have brought this to pass. Selfish? We're freelance police.

1211
02:11:51,850 --> 02:11:58,970
We save the world, sometimes on purpose. You got no clue the bad karma you've built up, man.

1212
02:11:58,970 --> 02:12:06,729
You will need the combined help of all three of us to defeat the demon. We will show you

1213
02:12:06,729 --> 02:12:13,850
three Christmases you've ruined. Set them right and we will consent to help you.

1214
02:12:13,850 --> 02:12:18,569
Where are you going? I have to get some air. I'm gonna talk shit right now.

1215
02:12:20,890 --> 02:12:24,090
Pause it for a second. Somebody said when the game is funnier than the streamer.

1216
02:12:25,420 --> 02:12:32,439
Well I'm sorry. I'm talking in real time here by myself over a video game that I'm just saying

1217
02:12:32,760 --> 02:12:39,159
time. Of course the game's gonna, they had like years to make this game with a team of writers

1218
02:12:39,720 --> 02:12:47,050
who every day for months came up with jokes. What? Of course there's gonna be better humor

1219
02:12:47,050 --> 02:12:52,979
in here. They had like a year and a half to write the jokes. You gave me 10 seconds. Sorry

1220
02:12:52,979 --> 02:12:58,729
I spoiled Megamind. That's what this is about. I know it is. That's what this is about. They're

1221
02:12:58,729 --> 02:13:10,489
mad because I spoiled fucking Megamind on them. Hey Sam, what time is it? Let's see. The

1222
02:13:10,489 --> 02:13:16,420
little hand is on the freckle and the corn cob pipe is on the right eyeball. Ready? Where does

1223
02:13:16,420 --> 02:13:26,760
the time go? Look at this. It's Santa's magical stocking stuffer. It fills the sock with whatever

1224
02:13:26,760 --> 02:13:32,199
gift the owner deserves. Oh let's try it. I think we'd need to have socks first. I was gonna

1225
02:13:32,199 --> 02:13:35,319
see them theaters after the stream. It's a record of what people got. You know how they

1226
02:13:36,199 --> 02:13:41,479
Jenny A. Nice kid. Sock full of toys. I know we're still on this but. Means well.

1227
02:13:41,560 --> 02:13:49,399
Sock full of candy. Steven G. Liar. Sock full of coal. Wow. Santa must really hate liars.

1228
02:13:49,399 --> 02:13:54,119
You know when they bring back movies for a limited run in the theaters? What if they

1229
02:13:54,119 --> 02:13:58,439
brought Megamind back for a new another run in the theaters for some reason? If they break

1230
02:13:58,439 --> 02:14:05,960
to IMAX or something or 3D for a couple months? Oh man. That would be fucking hilarious. But

1231
02:14:05,960 --> 02:14:09,880
why would they ever do that? That's such a forgettable movie. Not that it was a bad movie,

1232
02:14:09,880 --> 02:14:14,199
right? Listen, it's just not a movie you would bring back. Didn't win the Academy Awards.

1233
02:14:14,920 --> 02:14:32,439
That's my son's favorite movie. That's fine. I didn't say it was a bad movie.

1234
02:14:33,239 --> 02:14:39,960
No, one snowball is probably more than enough. A concrete car thanks for the five community

1235
02:14:39,960 --> 02:14:43,159
subs. There's a lot in this one. There's like a bunch of different things to do.

1236
02:14:43,159 --> 02:14:47,880
You cats ready to take a freaky trip to the past? Thanks for the five subs. You bet!

1237
02:14:49,159 --> 02:15:04,470
A team of writers spent months writing Megamind. Of course it's going to be better than this stream.

1238
02:15:06,329 --> 02:15:22,899
The game crashed. Uh oh. I didn't save it once. Is there an autosave here? No,

1239
02:15:22,899 --> 02:15:26,100
okay. I think we're fine. I just had my stomach just hurt for a second. I was like,

1240
02:15:26,180 --> 02:15:46,710
that was two hours. Gone. Oh boy, I hope so. Come on. What is this? Where is this?

1241
02:15:47,670 --> 02:15:51,909
Okay, I'm fucking having a little panic attack here because this is the first image of the

1242
02:15:51,909 --> 02:16:10,069
beginning of the game. Oh, thank god. Okay. Oh. All right, well let's go to the future.

1243
02:16:33,940 --> 02:16:40,059
The future. Oh no, we're spoiling our future.

1244
02:17:07,379 --> 02:17:13,700
Change our snackless fate. Surely we can alter these shadows before us perhaps with a larger

1245
02:17:13,700 --> 02:17:19,379
economy size bag of pork rinds or chips. You know, Max, we could find a way to get our future

1246
02:17:19,379 --> 02:17:33,959
selves out of this place. Yeah, I guess that'd work. So, uh, what's the scenario here? We need

1247
02:17:33,959 --> 02:17:39,399
to get snacks or something. We probably have to change the past. Why did you bring us here,

1248
02:17:39,399 --> 02:17:44,280
spirit? What do we do? Who wins the SEC? We probably have to bounce around between. I got

1249
02:17:44,280 --> 02:17:52,340
money riding on it. Yes, our future selves are trapped to die on a tiny outcropping of ash

1250
02:17:52,340 --> 02:17:59,930
surrounded by roiling magma. But what is it we're here to fix? Hold on, hold on before everybody

1251
02:17:59,930 --> 02:18:10,100
screams. I thought you can't talk to yourself. Don't I crack you up now, Sam? Sorry pal,

1252
02:18:10,100 --> 02:18:16,889
his material just seems fresher somehow. Hey, future me, would it hurt you to hit the treadmill

1253
02:18:16,889 --> 02:18:22,649
once in a while? Did you say something, Max? You mean after we're gonna die, it burns, it burns?

1254
02:18:23,450 --> 02:18:33,100
Topical. What do you mean? Anything else in here? No, just lava. All right, let's go to the past.

1255
02:18:46,549 --> 02:18:50,870
Game saved. I'm so glad they added that run. It really is great. Portals of the present.

1256
02:18:50,870 --> 02:18:57,030
Are we already in the present? How does that make any sense? You cats ready to take a freaky

1257
02:18:57,030 --> 02:19:04,549
trip to the past? You bet. I want to rub my body all over Mary Curie and see if you'll glow in the

1258
02:19:04,549 --> 02:19:11,899
dark. That'd be neat too. Wow, man. We ain't going back that far though. Jump in. All right,

1259
02:19:11,899 --> 02:19:23,930
don't crash. Oh, we're back here. Here we are in your office in a not too distant past.

1260
02:19:23,930 --> 02:19:28,250
I remember this. This is when we had to retrieve the toy mafia's meatball sandwich

1261
02:19:28,329 --> 02:19:32,250
that Leonard tried to fence to Jimmy. Do we get to beat up Leonard some more?

1262
02:19:32,250 --> 02:19:38,489
No way, Max. These cats can't sense your presence in any way. Dick, you are here to

1263
02:19:38,489 --> 02:19:44,409
right a terrible wrong you once committed. We have to stop ourselves from doing yo mama jokes.

1264
02:19:44,409 --> 02:19:51,290
Just watch. See you around, sucker. Stop ourselves from doing karate jokes. Hello, guys?

1265
02:19:51,850 --> 02:19:59,659
Jimmy, anybody? Well, Jimmy, where's this big score that's going to change everything?

1266
02:19:59,659 --> 02:20:04,459
Where's all the money that's going to save our dear tiny Timmy? Yes, daddy,

1267
02:20:04,459 --> 02:20:10,299
where the **** is it? Oh, it's hopeless. The doctors say his Tourette syndrome will kill him

1268
02:20:10,299 --> 02:20:17,989
if they don't operate soon. Don't cry, mommy. I'll get the **** with the **** angels.

1269
02:20:17,989 --> 02:20:21,989
It's all a bust, Mary. Every time I try to make an honest living,

1270
02:20:21,989 --> 02:20:28,790
Sam and Max smack me down. Oh, ****. Jimmy, we were all counting on you.

1271
02:20:28,790 --> 02:20:35,989
I know, Mary, I know. If only I'd have stuck to boxing, I could have been somebody.

1272
02:20:35,989 --> 02:20:39,670
All right, so we got to be in a wreck, which is what I am.

1273
02:20:39,670 --> 02:20:43,030
Stop him from boxing? So get your lucky boxing glove and go fight.

1274
02:20:44,229 --> 02:20:50,549
I don't have it no more. Sam and Max took it. Again with Sam and Max. If you spend more

1275
02:20:50,549 --> 02:20:55,829
time boxing and this time sitting around watching TV, you'll be champ. They said,

1276
02:20:55,829 --> 02:21:02,549
Jimmy, you're a washout. Please don't fight mommy and daddy. Daddy's my hero.

1277
02:21:02,549 --> 02:21:09,110
This is bad. This is not good. Poor Jimmy.

1278
02:21:20,280 --> 02:21:26,020
Oh my God. I'll go call the doctor to ease his suffering.

1279
02:21:26,020 --> 02:21:30,420
Just get that glove, Jimmy. A baby doesn't have much time to live.

1280
02:21:30,420 --> 02:21:34,659
I can't say all that on TV. That's probably a $400,000 FCC fine.

1281
02:21:34,659 --> 02:21:37,059
You see what you gotta do. Beat up Leonard some more?

1282
02:21:40,819 --> 02:21:47,030
All right, so we have to. Jimmy, stop sitting around and get that glove.

1283
02:21:47,030 --> 02:21:52,899
We have to get the box. He has to be a boxer and boxer.

1284
02:21:53,780 --> 02:21:57,270
I gotta get the glove. So I have to give him the glove.

1285
02:22:04,819 --> 02:22:06,100
We can't interact with anybody, can we?

1286
02:22:06,100 --> 02:22:09,290
We've come back from the grave to haunt you.

1287
02:22:09,290 --> 02:22:13,129
He can't hear us, Max. Also, we're not dead yet.

1288
02:22:17,899 --> 02:22:21,180
Being hit with a bleak snowball at this range could cause permanent blindness.

1289
02:22:22,059 --> 02:22:24,059
I usually draw the line at temporary blindness.

1290
02:22:24,059 --> 02:22:27,420
We need to get the glove from Jimmy in the present to give to Jimmy in the past.

1291
02:22:27,979 --> 02:22:35,079
So we have to get Jimmy to not jump off the ledge to get the glove to bring to here.

1292
02:22:39,659 --> 02:22:41,579
The street looks a lot less destroyed.

1293
02:22:45,239 --> 02:22:48,360
All right, so how do I get the glove from Jimmy?

1294
02:22:49,079 --> 02:22:51,159
That's the real question. Hold on, can you tell me?

1295
02:22:51,159 --> 02:22:52,520
So what do we have to do?

1296
02:22:52,520 --> 02:22:56,040
Can't you brock the signal these cats are sending you, man?

1297
02:22:56,040 --> 02:23:00,680
The ailing child, the nagging old lady, the boxer who lost his mojo.

1298
02:23:00,680 --> 02:23:01,879
I have to go back and lose?

1299
02:23:02,360 --> 02:23:06,360
Trap traps? No, you gotta get him back in the ring.

1300
02:23:06,360 --> 02:23:07,399
Okay, get him a glove.

1301
02:23:18,260 --> 02:23:21,059
I know I have to stop him from suiciding, I know.

1302
02:23:22,260 --> 02:23:23,459
But the question is how?

1303
02:23:24,100 --> 02:23:25,620
You don't gotta all caps me.

1304
02:23:26,340 --> 02:23:28,100
I just said I knew that's what I had to do.

1305
02:23:37,829 --> 02:23:42,809
All right, so what does the present do?

1306
02:23:43,620 --> 02:23:50,100
Prepare yourselves for a journey beyond imagination as we enter the present.

1307
02:23:58,969 --> 02:24:03,370
Sam and Max, witness how your reckless carelessness hurts those in...

1308
02:24:03,370 --> 02:24:06,010
Hey, wait a second. This isn't the present.

1309
02:24:06,010 --> 02:24:07,209
You took us to the past.

1310
02:24:07,770 --> 02:24:09,290
Past us are standing right there.

1311
02:24:09,290 --> 02:24:09,850
Yeah, this is the past.

1312
02:24:09,850 --> 02:24:11,049
I know that.

1313
02:24:11,049 --> 02:24:13,129
Just give it a minute to catch up.

1314
02:24:14,969 --> 02:24:15,129
What?

1315
02:24:15,129 --> 02:24:19,129
That's the limited edition pestilence maquette with super detailed open sores.

1316
02:24:19,850 --> 02:24:22,010
Aw, see how he slumps in his saddle.

1317
02:24:22,010 --> 02:24:23,770
Does he have any cool action features?

1318
02:24:23,770 --> 02:24:26,409
Cut it out, Max. You don't know what that'll do.

1319
02:24:26,409 --> 02:24:28,250
What's the worst a toy could do?

1320
02:24:28,329 --> 02:24:30,329
Choke a toddler? Blind a toddler?

1321
02:24:31,370 --> 02:24:32,489
Inviscerate?

1322
02:24:32,489 --> 02:24:34,409
Well, it looks like nothing happened anyway.

1323
02:24:34,409 --> 02:24:34,889
Let's go.

1324
02:24:35,850 --> 02:24:36,489
Oh, no.

1325
02:24:37,129 --> 02:24:43,209
Seriously, we had a totally boss bug summoning toy and we wasted it on a stupid exorcism.

1326
02:24:43,209 --> 02:24:44,250
Teen hut!

1327
02:24:44,250 --> 02:24:45,610
That too, sergeant.

1328
02:24:45,610 --> 02:24:46,170
What?

1329
02:24:46,170 --> 02:24:48,170
How did you stink bugs find me?

1330
02:24:48,170 --> 02:24:49,370
This place is great.

1331
02:24:50,010 --> 02:24:52,649
Beaty brother too good to share with his family?

1332
02:24:52,649 --> 02:24:54,569
Too good to birth radio silent to cause this problem.

1333
02:24:54,569 --> 02:24:56,010
Another family problem.

1334
02:24:56,010 --> 02:24:57,930
Been on a work mission, ma'am.

1335
02:24:57,930 --> 02:25:01,129
Been hanging out with those filthy dungies more like me.

1336
02:25:01,129 --> 02:25:03,209
They don't even speak our language.

1337
02:25:03,209 --> 02:25:06,729
As long as my family's together again, I'm never leaving.

1338
02:25:06,729 --> 02:25:07,930
Mayday! Mayday!

1339
02:25:07,930 --> 02:25:09,450
Request immediate evac.

1340
02:25:09,450 --> 02:25:11,129
Immediate evac!

1341
02:25:11,129 --> 02:25:11,610
So what?

1342
02:25:11,610 --> 02:25:13,690
We have to rekindle the bugs' love for his family?

1343
02:25:13,690 --> 02:25:15,450
Teach them what they really mean to him?

1344
02:25:15,450 --> 02:25:16,250
Oh, my.

1345
02:25:16,250 --> 02:25:16,889
No fair.

1346
02:25:16,889 --> 02:25:18,170
Have you seen them?

1347
02:25:18,170 --> 02:25:19,610
They're awful.

1348
02:25:19,610 --> 02:25:21,930
You have to get rid of them.

1349
02:25:21,930 --> 02:25:22,729
Oh, boy.

1350
02:25:22,729 --> 02:25:24,329
I'll go get my stomping boots.

1351
02:25:24,969 --> 02:25:27,129
Non-violently.

1352
02:25:28,090 --> 02:25:28,569
All right.

1353
02:25:32,309 --> 02:25:33,030
Let me see.

1354
02:25:33,030 --> 02:25:38,469
We've got gift tags, simplest maze, and spirit bottle.

1355
02:25:38,469 --> 02:25:40,229
The maze has definitely put something here.

1356
02:25:41,190 --> 02:25:44,120
Can I like do something with the maze?

1357
02:25:44,680 --> 02:25:45,799
Not happening.

1358
02:25:45,799 --> 02:25:46,600
What do I do with the maze?

1359
02:25:46,600 --> 02:25:47,799
I've had it for a long time.

1360
02:25:47,799 --> 02:25:48,840
Hello, sir.

1361
02:25:48,840 --> 02:25:50,200
He can't hear us, Sam.

1362
02:25:51,399 --> 02:25:52,600
What is that?

1363
02:25:52,600 --> 02:25:54,680
It smells like wet ghost dog.

1364
02:25:54,680 --> 02:25:57,000
Maybe can I do the maze to the rats?

1365
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:58,680
Well, I didn't think it was that funny.

1366
02:25:58,680 --> 02:26:00,280
But whatever turns you on.

1367
02:26:00,280 --> 02:26:01,159
I didn't say that.

1368
02:26:01,159 --> 02:26:01,799
The bug did.

1369
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:04,520
What else is in here?

1370
02:26:05,719 --> 02:26:06,520
Hey, Sybil.

1371
02:26:06,520 --> 02:26:07,719
Oh, she can't hear us.

1372
02:26:09,139 --> 02:26:10,020
Hey, Abe.

1373
02:26:10,020 --> 02:26:11,139
Oh, he can't hear us.

1374
02:26:13,139 --> 02:26:17,739
Think it'd scare anyone if we started playing the jukebox?

1375
02:26:17,739 --> 02:26:18,620
Probably.

1376
02:26:18,620 --> 02:26:20,379
Your taste in music scares even me.

1377
02:26:22,040 --> 02:26:23,399
Can't change the channel.

1378
02:26:24,200 --> 02:26:27,110
Anything else over here?

1379
02:26:31,479 --> 02:26:32,440
Hey, Stinky.

1380
02:26:32,440 --> 02:26:33,559
Oh, she can't hear us.

1381
02:26:34,200 --> 02:26:39,350
All right.

1382
02:26:39,350 --> 02:26:41,270
Well, bug family.

1383
02:26:42,149 --> 02:26:43,750
Anybody else feel that?

1384
02:26:43,750 --> 02:26:44,389
Sure did.

1385
02:26:45,190 --> 02:26:48,170
Some kind of angry, violent presence.

1386
02:26:48,170 --> 02:26:50,090
And strangely familiar.

1387
02:26:50,090 --> 02:26:51,370
Is that you, Dad?

1388
02:26:51,370 --> 02:26:54,170
We haven't seen him since the attack of the cleaners.

1389
02:26:54,170 --> 02:26:55,530
Give us a sign, Father.

1390
02:26:56,899 --> 02:26:57,399
Okay.

1391
02:26:58,840 --> 02:27:02,360
So the idea here is, what if I just go back?

1392
02:27:08,219 --> 02:27:10,379
Maybe press the button on the...

1393
02:27:10,379 --> 02:27:11,819
No, but I don't have it there.

1394
02:27:12,459 --> 02:27:16,629
Let's go out of here.

1395
02:27:17,430 --> 02:27:20,020
Let me try the maze on the rat.

1396
02:27:20,020 --> 02:27:21,059
Why would that do anything, though?

1397
02:27:21,540 --> 02:27:27,219
The future doesn't...

1398
02:27:27,219 --> 02:27:27,860
There's nothing there.

1399
02:27:31,110 --> 02:27:32,149
I mean, I'm in the...

1400
02:27:32,149 --> 02:27:33,590
I can still do stuff now.

1401
02:27:39,340 --> 02:27:40,540
Let me just see what this does.

1402
02:27:41,540 --> 02:27:42,819
Look alive, Cheek.

1403
02:27:42,819 --> 02:27:44,260
Lead on, brother.

1404
02:27:45,159 --> 02:27:48,040
I'm gonna try just the maze here and see if I can put it down.

1405
02:27:55,100 --> 02:27:56,700
Jimmy, stop sitting around and get that glove.

1406
02:27:56,700 --> 02:27:58,379
Most rats would love a maze for Christmas.

1407
02:27:58,379 --> 02:27:58,620
No.

1408
02:27:58,620 --> 02:28:00,540
But this rat only wants his boxing glove.

1409
02:28:05,459 --> 02:28:09,079
Nope.

1410
02:28:09,079 --> 02:28:10,520
I gotta get him off the ledge.

1411
02:28:11,239 --> 02:28:11,959
The booze?

1412
02:28:11,959 --> 02:28:13,399
Maybe, like, how do I get him...

1413
02:28:13,399 --> 02:28:14,200
That's how I get the glove.

1414
02:28:14,200 --> 02:28:14,920
I need to get...

1415
02:28:14,920 --> 02:28:16,440
Go back to the reality here.

1416
02:28:16,440 --> 02:28:17,399
The real reality.

1417
02:28:31,799 --> 02:28:33,559
Can I give him, like, the booze?

1418
02:28:34,440 --> 02:28:37,719
Well, what is this thing?

1419
02:28:37,719 --> 02:28:39,159
Oh, that's the corporate presence.

1420
02:28:39,159 --> 02:28:41,000
Freelance police help spawn.

1421
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:42,360
You're under arrest.

1422
02:28:42,360 --> 02:28:44,440
You have the right to remain viscous.

1423
02:28:52,600 --> 02:28:53,239
I mean, yeah.

1424
02:28:53,239 --> 02:28:54,840
You'd think the rat maze would do it, but...

1425
02:28:57,850 --> 02:28:58,649
I was clicking on Jimmy.

1426
02:28:58,649 --> 02:29:00,010
Can I click on the kid?

1427
02:29:10,620 --> 02:29:11,180
Jimmy.

1428
02:29:11,180 --> 02:29:12,139
Timmy this...

1429
02:29:12,139 --> 02:29:12,540
Here we go.

1430
02:29:12,540 --> 02:29:12,860
Hold on.

1431
02:29:13,739 --> 02:29:14,940
Timmy two teeth.

1432
02:29:14,940 --> 02:29:17,420
Rats do love mazes, but giving a dying kid

1433
02:29:17,420 --> 02:29:19,979
a cunningly disguised trap seems cruel.

1434
02:29:26,389 --> 02:29:28,229
Merry Christmas, Mrs. Two Teeth.

1435
02:29:28,229 --> 02:29:28,709
Come on.

1436
02:29:28,709 --> 02:29:30,629
We've got you the one gift every rat loves.

1437
02:29:30,629 --> 02:29:30,950
Really?

1438
02:29:30,950 --> 02:29:32,229
An impossible maze.

1439
02:29:32,790 --> 02:29:41,690
Yeah, I'm gonna get it.

1440
02:29:41,690 --> 02:29:42,729
So now in the...

1441
02:29:42,729 --> 02:29:45,129
I hope Mrs. Two Teeth appreciates the finest...

1442
02:29:47,530 --> 02:29:52,520
So now if I go into the present, is she gonna be in there?

1443
02:29:56,739 --> 02:30:00,020
And she's gonna come out and I'm gonna make her talk him off the ledge.

1444
02:30:00,579 --> 02:30:11,399
Let's see.

1445
02:30:11,399 --> 02:30:11,799
Hold on.

1446
02:30:12,940 --> 02:30:15,930
Where to, sir?

1447
02:30:15,930 --> 02:30:18,489
Let's head back to civilization, or what's left of it.

1448
02:30:18,489 --> 02:30:18,989
Good thing!

1449
02:30:20,340 --> 02:30:21,620
Let's see if she's in there.

1450
02:30:30,180 --> 02:30:48,819
Okay.

1451
02:30:48,819 --> 02:30:49,799
Now is this here?

1452
02:30:55,190 --> 02:30:55,829
It's not there!

1453
02:30:56,389 --> 02:30:57,909
We never should have let that deadbeat...

1454
02:31:01,540 --> 02:31:02,899
Wait, is he on the window?

1455
02:31:04,389 --> 02:31:05,190
I can't read...

1456
02:31:05,190 --> 02:31:06,069
We'll have to talk...

1457
02:31:06,069 --> 02:31:06,469
Wait a minute.

1458
02:31:06,469 --> 02:31:07,190
Wait, hold on a second.

1459
02:31:07,190 --> 02:31:07,430
Is he...

1460
02:31:10,069 --> 02:31:10,950
Was he on the window?

1461
02:31:17,879 --> 02:31:18,520
Fuck.

1462
02:31:18,520 --> 02:31:20,090
Didn't do it.

1463
02:31:20,649 --> 02:31:27,860
Wait, let me try to give him the...

1464
02:31:27,860 --> 02:31:28,819
What I was gonna try before.

1465
02:31:28,819 --> 02:31:29,459
Give him the booze.

1466
02:31:33,260 --> 02:31:33,739
You want this?

1467
02:31:34,459 --> 02:31:35,340
Nothing doing.

1468
02:31:35,340 --> 02:31:39,209
No.

1469
02:31:39,530 --> 02:31:42,250
It's the guy that did something through the maze and the boxing club.

1470
02:31:42,250 --> 02:31:43,209
The wife and the...

1471
02:31:43,930 --> 02:31:49,670
Where to, Sam?

1472
02:31:50,389 --> 02:31:53,180
Can I just...

1473
02:31:53,180 --> 02:31:53,500
Wait, hold on.

1474
02:31:53,500 --> 02:31:54,059
Let me talk to him.

1475
02:31:54,620 --> 02:31:56,979
Because I did place it.

1476
02:31:57,780 --> 02:31:59,290
Oh, that was a big one.

1477
02:31:59,290 --> 02:32:00,409
I'm gonna do it!

1478
02:32:00,409 --> 02:32:01,770
I'll jump, I tell ya!

1479
02:32:01,770 --> 02:32:02,729
Hang on a second, Jimmy.

1480
02:32:05,620 --> 02:32:06,979
Smile, Jimmy.

1481
02:32:06,979 --> 02:32:07,379
What about...

1482
02:32:08,739 --> 02:32:09,780
Smile, Jimmy?

1483
02:32:09,780 --> 02:32:10,180
What is it?

1484
02:32:10,180 --> 02:32:10,579
Look on the...

1485
02:32:11,860 --> 02:32:13,780
Turn that frown upside down.

1486
02:32:13,780 --> 02:32:15,940
That nonsense ain't helping.

1487
02:32:15,940 --> 02:32:16,819
Sorry, Jimmy.

1488
02:32:16,819 --> 02:32:20,420
It's just that suicide is too horrible for me to even contemplate.

1489
02:32:20,420 --> 02:32:22,260
Even though we'd all be happier if you were dead.

1490
02:32:23,940 --> 02:32:24,739
So there's no, like...

1491
02:32:24,739 --> 02:32:25,540
What about your wife?

1492
02:32:25,540 --> 02:32:28,739
No wife, no family, no job.

1493
02:32:28,739 --> 02:32:30,420
What right side?

1494
02:32:30,420 --> 02:32:32,659
Well, with all the brain damage you got from boxing,

1495
02:32:32,659 --> 02:32:34,579
you'd make a great bacon-eyed janitor.

1496
02:32:35,780 --> 02:32:36,500
Nuts.

1497
02:32:36,500 --> 02:32:38,739
My boxing career didn't even last long enough

1498
02:32:38,739 --> 02:32:40,819
to give me a decent case of brain damage.

1499
02:32:42,920 --> 02:32:45,559
You know your wife's gonna give you hell if you kill yourself.

1500
02:32:45,559 --> 02:32:46,520
Mary!

1501
02:32:46,520 --> 02:32:47,319
She left me!

1502
02:32:47,959 --> 02:32:49,639
You're overreacting, Jimmy.

1503
02:32:49,639 --> 02:32:50,760
You think?

1504
02:32:50,760 --> 02:32:51,239
Sure.

1505
02:32:51,239 --> 02:32:53,639
Your wife probably never really loved you in the first place.

1506
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:56,219
I gotta get the glove.

1507
02:32:56,219 --> 02:32:56,540
It's...

1508
02:32:56,540 --> 02:32:57,420
We're in a paradox.

1509
02:32:57,420 --> 02:33:00,219
I have to get the glove to give him a pass so he boxes,

1510
02:33:00,219 --> 02:33:01,899
but I need to keep the wife there

1511
02:33:01,899 --> 02:33:04,059
so he doesn't end up going down the path.

1512
02:33:05,180 --> 02:33:06,700
Max, I don't think this is helping.

1513
02:33:06,700 --> 02:33:07,260
I disagree.

1514
02:33:09,610 --> 02:33:11,049
We gotta break the loop here.

1515
02:33:11,770 --> 02:33:14,389
How do I get his wife to...

1516
02:33:16,790 --> 02:33:20,760
What is the point of the trap?

1517
02:33:21,719 --> 02:33:22,440
Hold on.

1518
02:33:22,440 --> 02:33:24,569
We're off to the North Pole.

1519
02:33:34,200 --> 02:33:35,399
Am I missing something here?

1520
02:33:40,700 --> 02:33:45,399
Because at present, the trap is that I have this alcohol.

1521
02:33:46,360 --> 02:33:49,059
I have a snowball.

1522
02:33:49,700 --> 02:33:51,379
The family is just out there.

1523
02:33:53,079 --> 02:33:55,639
How do I get the wife to go into the maze?

1524
02:33:56,520 --> 02:34:02,889
How are we doing on fuel?

1525
02:34:02,889 --> 02:34:05,079
It's running low on coal.

1526
02:34:05,879 --> 02:34:07,579
I can't take anything from that.

1527
02:34:07,579 --> 02:34:08,139
All right, hold on.

1528
02:34:09,579 --> 02:34:10,540
Let's go back in here.

1529
02:34:14,649 --> 02:34:16,409
Let's exhaust some options in here.

1530
02:34:32,139 --> 02:34:32,780
She's talking.

1531
02:34:37,139 --> 02:34:37,620
Take the coat.

1532
02:34:37,620 --> 02:34:38,420
It's always the coat hanger.

1533
02:34:51,909 --> 02:34:52,549
Is that really it?

1534
02:34:55,909 --> 02:34:56,629
What?

1535
02:34:56,629 --> 02:34:57,030
That is...

1536
02:34:59,670 --> 02:35:00,549
We can work it out.

1537
02:35:01,270 --> 02:35:02,469
I just took his wife.

1538
02:35:03,350 --> 02:35:04,229
She left me.

1539
02:35:04,870 --> 02:35:06,709
Now I'll never see her again.

1540
02:35:08,629 --> 02:35:09,510
I know, son.

1541
02:35:10,069 --> 02:35:10,549
I know.

1542
02:35:14,819 --> 02:35:15,139
Okay.

1543
02:35:16,280 --> 02:35:19,620
So now we go to the present.

1544
02:35:19,620 --> 02:35:21,219
We put the wife down.

1545
02:35:22,020 --> 02:35:26,899
We show them that we let the wife out.

1546
02:35:34,979 --> 02:35:35,780
Okay.

1547
02:35:35,780 --> 02:35:38,420
I guess we're just gonna hold her up and be like,

1548
02:35:38,420 --> 02:35:39,059
here she is.

1549
02:35:39,540 --> 02:35:45,639
Oh, no.

1550
02:35:45,639 --> 02:35:45,959
Yeah.

1551
02:35:45,959 --> 02:35:47,159
This is how she left.

1552
02:35:48,819 --> 02:35:49,620
Oh, shit.

1553
02:35:50,180 --> 02:35:52,420
I told you this is time travel.

1554
02:35:57,399 --> 02:35:58,200
We took her.

1555
02:36:04,950 --> 02:36:05,670
Oh, wow.

1556
02:36:07,739 --> 02:36:08,059
Okay.

1557
02:36:08,059 --> 02:36:08,540
Here we go.

1558
02:36:09,700 --> 02:36:09,940
Look.

1559
02:36:28,260 --> 02:36:33,059
Oh.

1560
02:36:33,059 --> 02:36:35,459
I hope he takes the glove off and it's a huge fucking human hand.

1561
02:36:52,420 --> 02:36:52,920
Got it.

1562
02:36:58,819 --> 02:37:02,659
Oh, my God.

1563
02:37:03,299 --> 02:37:04,260
That was awful.

1564
02:37:07,350 --> 02:37:08,469
Why did you do that?

1565
02:37:16,459 --> 02:37:17,180
Give him the glove.

1566
02:37:21,020 --> 02:37:21,579
Why not?

1567
02:37:21,579 --> 02:37:21,819
Yeah.

1568
02:37:27,399 --> 02:37:27,959
Let's go.

1569
02:37:28,760 --> 02:37:41,079
Here you go.

1570
02:37:42,469 --> 02:37:43,670
Now be the best boxer ever.

1571
02:37:43,670 --> 02:37:45,030
And then we're gonna lose to him.

1572
02:37:46,569 --> 02:37:47,049
Probably not.

1573
02:37:47,049 --> 02:37:49,370
This is probably just as simple as clicking on you and then we win.

1574
02:37:51,670 --> 02:37:52,149
Excuse me.

1575
02:37:52,149 --> 02:37:52,389
Makes.

1576
02:37:52,389 --> 02:37:52,950
Get out of the way.

1577
02:37:52,950 --> 02:37:53,590
Thank you, makes.

1578
02:37:58,620 --> 02:37:58,860
What?

1579
02:37:59,420 --> 02:38:00,459
Could it be true?

1580
02:38:01,270 --> 02:38:06,229
Timmy, look, it's your pa's lucky boxing glove.

1581
02:38:06,229 --> 02:38:09,579
Where the fuck did that come from, daddy?

1582
02:38:09,579 --> 02:38:11,100
I don't know, son.

1583
02:38:11,100 --> 02:38:14,139
All I know is I finally got a second chance.

1584
02:38:14,780 --> 02:38:17,780
It's a fucking Christmas miracle.

1585
02:38:17,780 --> 02:38:18,420
Stop that.

1586
02:38:19,540 --> 02:38:22,899
I ain't never gonna get anything out of my sight again.

1587
02:38:22,899 --> 02:38:24,340
Now, come on, son.

1588
02:38:24,340 --> 02:38:26,659
No squares are allowed on Twitch.

1589
02:38:26,659 --> 02:38:28,819
And get you that operation.

1590
02:38:31,639 --> 02:38:33,399
Way to go, dudes.

1591
02:38:33,399 --> 02:38:35,079
You saved Christmas past.

1592
02:38:35,799 --> 02:38:38,600
So let's move on back to the present.

1593
02:38:40,840 --> 02:38:44,090
The rats made you and the rats will destroy you.

1594
02:38:48,819 --> 02:38:54,100
Sam and Max, you made up for your past and helped Jimmy find his way.

1595
02:38:54,100 --> 02:38:56,180
Now for your reward.

1596
02:38:56,180 --> 02:38:58,500
Your eternal reward.

1597
02:38:58,500 --> 02:39:02,979
I'm just gonna chill in this bottle until you're ready to unleash all three of us

1598
02:39:02,979 --> 02:39:04,899
cats on that fascist demon.

1599
02:39:06,579 --> 02:39:07,219
Nope.

1600
02:39:13,399 --> 02:39:15,639
Okay, so we have done that.

1601
02:39:15,639 --> 02:39:17,799
We now have one spirit in the bottle.

1602
02:39:18,360 --> 02:39:19,799
We now have to figure out this shit.

1603
02:39:20,920 --> 02:39:27,639
Which is we've got the future, which is just standing there.

1604
02:39:27,639 --> 02:39:29,239
That didn't really do anything for us.

1605
02:39:29,239 --> 02:39:31,559
That just closed up that little port of the present.

1606
02:39:32,120 --> 02:39:38,569
Let's go back to the future and see.

1607
02:39:39,370 --> 02:39:41,370
Ready to hit the future again, Max?

1608
02:39:41,370 --> 02:39:42,489
Go ahead without me.

1609
02:39:42,489 --> 02:39:43,530
I'll catch up.

1610
02:39:43,530 --> 02:39:44,409
Just get in here.

1611
02:39:45,209 --> 02:39:50,780
Bottle of spirits.

1612
02:39:50,780 --> 02:39:52,139
I get it because alcohol is scary.

1613
02:39:52,139 --> 02:39:53,180
Why are you capsing me right now?

1614
02:39:53,180 --> 02:39:54,379
We still haven't escaped yet?

1615
02:39:55,020 --> 02:39:56,379
I'm disappointed.

1616
02:39:56,379 --> 02:39:59,500
It's people like us that give people like us a bad name.

1617
02:40:03,530 --> 02:40:04,569
There's nothing else in here.

1618
02:40:06,139 --> 02:40:07,420
Jimmy didn't do something different.

1619
02:40:14,329 --> 02:40:17,930
I'd better start dieting now if I want to be in shape for my inevitable death.

1620
02:40:17,930 --> 02:40:19,209
Can I throw a snowball at myself?

1621
02:40:20,840 --> 02:40:22,040
Hey there, sexy.

1622
02:40:22,040 --> 02:40:27,590
I'll be back to pick you up later.

1623
02:40:27,590 --> 02:40:29,350
Being hit with a bleached snowball at this time.

1624
02:40:29,829 --> 02:40:39,590
I don't think I can do anything.

1625
02:40:39,590 --> 02:40:41,270
I need an item or something.

1626
02:40:41,270 --> 02:40:45,239
What happens if you kill yourself in the future?

1627
02:40:46,920 --> 02:40:53,030
Can you tell us what to do in charades?

1628
02:40:53,030 --> 02:40:53,590
Is that it?

1629
02:40:54,950 --> 02:40:55,350
Nothing.

1630
02:40:56,950 --> 02:40:57,590
Okay, okay.

1631
02:40:57,590 --> 02:40:59,909
One word sounds like fiery death.

1632
02:41:02,889 --> 02:41:05,209
I'm skipping the text we've heard three times already.

1633
02:41:07,139 --> 02:41:08,180
I better start dieting.

1634
02:41:09,059 --> 02:41:11,299
Are you mad that you don't get to hear that an eighth time?

1635
02:41:11,860 --> 02:41:14,620
What if I didn't hear that one?

1636
02:41:14,620 --> 02:41:15,020
Yeah, I did.

1637
02:41:24,250 --> 02:41:25,610
Skipping the fight.

1638
02:41:25,610 --> 02:41:26,729
It was the shooting one.

1639
02:41:27,530 --> 02:41:28,569
Oh, well, whatever.

1640
02:41:30,840 --> 02:41:32,280
Santa's coal powered sleigh.

1641
02:41:34,219 --> 02:41:34,860
Santa's coal.

1642
02:41:36,860 --> 02:41:37,180
Coal?

1643
02:41:39,180 --> 02:41:40,459
It's running low on coal.

1644
02:41:40,459 --> 02:41:41,180
I need coal.

1645
02:41:44,139 --> 02:41:46,700
Can I dump this guy's energy in here?

1646
02:41:48,629 --> 02:41:48,950
Coal?

1647
02:41:50,229 --> 02:41:51,799
Where do I get coal?

1648
02:41:51,799 --> 02:41:53,399
I gotta get from the stockings.

1649
02:41:57,579 --> 02:41:57,979
Wait a minute.

1650
02:41:57,979 --> 02:41:58,459
Get out of my way.

1651
02:41:58,459 --> 02:41:59,180
Let me go over here.

1652
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:15,000
So you're telling me this was for nothing?

1653
02:42:16,729 --> 02:42:19,770
This trampoline cannon toy bomber thing?

1654
02:42:19,770 --> 02:42:21,290
I don't have to even use right now?

1655
02:42:22,010 --> 02:42:23,829
It was for nothing.

1656
02:42:25,270 --> 02:42:26,309
They set this up.

1657
02:42:26,309 --> 02:42:29,110
I took like 30 to 40 minutes in the beginning of this stream

1658
02:42:29,110 --> 02:42:30,309
trying to figure out how to do this.

1659
02:42:31,030 --> 02:42:34,489
I can't be right.

1660
02:42:34,489 --> 02:42:39,700
It was just for fun.

1661
02:42:39,700 --> 02:42:40,260
Well, whatever.

1662
02:42:40,260 --> 02:42:41,299
Okay, that's cool.

1663
02:42:42,020 --> 02:42:44,040
All right, where is it?

1664
02:42:44,040 --> 02:42:45,159
Stocking stuffer.

1665
02:42:45,159 --> 02:42:46,040
Look at this.

1666
02:42:46,040 --> 02:42:48,200
It's Santa's magical stocking stuffer.

1667
02:42:48,200 --> 02:42:49,079
So the sock.

1668
02:42:49,079 --> 02:42:51,559
With whatever gift the owner deserves.

1669
02:42:51,559 --> 02:42:53,000
Oh, let's try it.

1670
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:54,600
I think we need to have socks first.

1671
02:42:54,600 --> 02:42:55,879
So we have to get a pair of socks.

1672
02:42:57,399 --> 02:43:00,069
Where can I get socks?

1673
02:43:00,870 --> 02:43:03,850
I need a pair of socks.

1674
02:43:04,649 --> 02:43:08,120
Santa doesn't have socks lying around here somewhere.

1675
02:43:08,680 --> 02:43:12,120
Okay.

1676
02:43:20,540 --> 02:43:23,799
Are the Curly Larry and Moe still out there?

1677
02:43:23,799 --> 02:43:24,280
Whatever they are.

1678
02:43:25,159 --> 02:43:27,940
No, no socks here.

1679
02:43:33,940 --> 02:43:34,180
No.

1680
02:43:34,899 --> 02:43:54,120
Are these little weirdos over here still?

1681
02:43:54,120 --> 02:43:56,760
No, they're gone.

1682
02:43:56,760 --> 02:43:57,159
Socks.

1683
02:43:58,459 --> 02:43:59,340
We're gonna get a pair of socks.

1684
02:43:59,340 --> 02:44:01,819
Let us return to the present.

1685
02:44:02,620 --> 02:44:10,569
Off topic, but how much?

1686
02:44:10,569 --> 02:44:11,049
Never mind.

1687
02:44:12,340 --> 02:44:13,459
That's very off topic.

1688
02:44:13,459 --> 02:44:14,340
That's so off topic.

1689
02:44:14,340 --> 02:44:15,540
That's not even like I'm not.

1690
02:44:15,540 --> 02:44:17,459
Why would I would never would read that?

1691
02:44:18,100 --> 02:44:18,420
Okay.

1692
02:44:19,059 --> 02:44:19,780
Just what we need.

1693
02:44:20,500 --> 02:44:28,649
I mean, there was a feet command here.

1694
02:44:29,590 --> 02:44:30,469
Hey, stinky.

1695
02:44:30,469 --> 02:44:31,670
Oh, she can't hear us.

1696
02:44:32,309 --> 02:44:33,270
No, it's in the other.

1697
02:44:33,270 --> 02:44:33,989
No, I gotta go back.

1698
02:44:41,340 --> 02:44:42,540
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1699
02:44:42,540 --> 02:44:43,180
That's the only.

1700
02:44:44,299 --> 02:44:45,579
Is she even wearing socks?

1701
02:44:48,409 --> 02:44:50,010
Why would I go to them?

1702
02:44:50,010 --> 02:44:51,129
Why would I go up to her and be like,

1703
02:44:51,129 --> 02:44:53,610
Hey, can I have your socks?

1704
02:44:58,469 --> 02:44:58,709
No.

1705
02:45:04,059 --> 02:45:05,579
They're for a quest.

1706
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:07,399
Okay.

1707
02:45:09,299 --> 02:45:10,579
It's adorable.

1708
02:45:10,579 --> 02:45:12,899
I think it might be a warning, Sam.

1709
02:45:12,899 --> 02:45:13,940
Still adorable.

1710
02:45:26,010 --> 02:45:26,489
Hold on.

1711
02:45:27,799 --> 02:45:29,159
Where to, Sam?

1712
02:45:29,159 --> 02:45:30,520
Is that really what it is?

1713
02:45:30,520 --> 02:45:31,559
Let's head back to.

1714
02:45:31,559 --> 02:45:32,280
Good thinking.

1715
02:45:34,420 --> 02:45:54,649
I thought about the bugs.

1716
02:45:57,180 --> 02:45:57,979
Bug family.

1717
02:45:58,780 --> 02:46:06,469
Come here.

1718
02:46:06,469 --> 02:46:07,590
Let's let's talk about this.

1719
02:46:09,780 --> 02:46:11,459
Standing up all day, getting you down.

1720
02:46:11,459 --> 02:46:14,979
And how I was made for sunning beach sunning.

1721
02:46:15,860 --> 02:46:18,899
Not slinging hashed counter side for a pack of ingrates.

1722
02:46:19,860 --> 02:46:21,059
This doesn't mean anything.

1723
02:46:21,940 --> 02:46:24,020
Any tips on dealing with cockroaches?

1724
02:46:24,020 --> 02:46:25,299
That depends.

1725
02:46:25,299 --> 02:46:28,420
If they're in the soup, just scoop them out.

1726
02:46:28,420 --> 02:46:31,860
If they're on the pizza, it's easier just to eat around them.

1727
02:46:34,420 --> 02:46:35,059
Um, okay.

1728
02:46:36,250 --> 02:46:36,729
So long.

1729
02:46:44,629 --> 02:46:45,430
Bug family.

1730
02:46:45,430 --> 02:46:46,069
Hello, sir.

1731
02:46:46,870 --> 02:46:50,309
What happened to your dad?

1732
02:46:50,309 --> 02:46:51,510
You really want to know?

1733
02:46:52,149 --> 02:46:53,190
No, not really.

1734
02:46:53,190 --> 02:46:54,790
It was our toughest battle yet.

1735
02:46:54,790 --> 02:46:57,670
We secured our positions in a heavily fortified dumpster.

1736
02:46:57,670 --> 02:47:00,870
When suddenly they came out of nowhere.

1737
02:47:00,870 --> 02:47:01,829
Who?

1738
02:47:01,829 --> 02:47:03,590
The cleaning crew.

1739
02:47:03,590 --> 02:47:05,350
Cleaning crew.

1740
02:47:05,350 --> 02:47:07,510
Attacking with sanitation.

1741
02:47:07,510 --> 02:47:09,350
That's just plain dirty.

1742
02:47:09,350 --> 02:47:11,110
Get stinky socks.

1743
02:47:11,110 --> 02:47:12,389
Overpowering.

1744
02:47:12,389 --> 02:47:13,270
We all would have gotten.

1745
02:47:13,270 --> 02:47:13,670
I don't.

1746
02:47:13,670 --> 02:47:15,750
I think I'm getting, like, baited.

1747
02:47:15,750 --> 02:47:17,590
I still remember his last words.

1748
02:47:18,309 --> 02:47:19,829
Move out, maggots.

1749
02:47:19,829 --> 02:47:21,030
God, he was concise.

1750
02:47:22,309 --> 02:47:23,030
Cleaning.

1751
02:47:23,030 --> 02:47:23,670
Every time.

1752
02:47:24,389 --> 02:47:25,590
Every time?

1753
02:47:27,989 --> 02:47:28,790
I know what to do.

1754
02:47:34,389 --> 02:47:35,670
Can't you get your family to leave?

1755
02:47:36,629 --> 02:47:39,350
This sorry regiment never listens to me.

1756
02:47:39,350 --> 02:47:41,590
These half-wits would only listen to my father.

1757
02:47:41,590 --> 02:47:43,670
God rest his exoskeleton.

1758
02:47:45,239 --> 02:47:46,120
Goodbye.

1759
02:47:46,120 --> 02:47:46,680
Keep them dead.

1760
02:47:47,639 --> 02:47:51,110
Being hit with a bleached snowball at this rate.

1761
02:47:51,110 --> 02:47:51,430
No.

1762
02:47:52,790 --> 02:47:53,190
And?

1763
02:47:53,750 --> 02:47:55,430
That was so clever.

1764
02:47:56,309 --> 02:47:56,629
Really?

1765
02:47:59,540 --> 02:48:02,420
I think I'll save my snowball for a more satisfying target.

1766
02:48:04,299 --> 02:48:04,860
No.

1767
02:48:04,860 --> 02:48:06,889
That's not it?

1768
02:48:09,590 --> 02:48:11,430
But where's the, where's the watering can?

1769
02:48:12,069 --> 02:48:20,469
Can I throw it at the different time period?

1770
02:48:20,469 --> 02:48:35,420
In the, at the.

1771
02:48:35,420 --> 02:48:36,379
Where to, Sam?

1772
02:48:37,340 --> 02:48:39,340
We're off to the North Pole.

1773
02:48:44,659 --> 02:48:48,889
Let's see if I can do it in the other presence.

1774
02:49:05,620 --> 02:49:06,739
Okay, so now.

1775
02:49:07,700 --> 02:49:09,500
To containment.

1776
02:49:09,500 --> 02:49:10,620
No, no, no, I know, I know, I know.

1777
02:49:15,579 --> 02:49:16,059
Got it.

1778
02:49:16,059 --> 02:49:16,559
Whoa!

1779
02:49:17,260 --> 02:49:19,180
Cleaning crews on all sides.

1780
02:49:19,180 --> 02:49:21,180
Father, it is you.

1781
02:49:21,180 --> 02:49:23,260
The butterflies are pinned down!

1782
02:49:23,260 --> 02:49:24,860
Move out, maggots!

1783
02:49:24,860 --> 02:49:26,059
Sir, yes, sir!

1784
02:49:26,059 --> 02:49:27,180
Company, march!

1785
02:49:29,860 --> 02:49:31,459
What in tarnation?

1786
02:49:31,459 --> 02:49:32,659
My family!

1787
02:49:32,659 --> 02:49:35,540
Imagine taking this long to beat a putt-putt spinoff?

1788
02:49:36,260 --> 02:49:37,379
Well done.

1789
02:49:37,379 --> 02:49:39,299
Now, let us return.

1790
02:49:39,299 --> 02:49:39,860
Get over it.

1791
02:49:39,860 --> 02:49:41,459
To the present.

1792
02:49:48,440 --> 02:49:53,159
I must admit your obedience was acceptable.

1793
02:49:53,159 --> 02:49:55,319
I suppose I can help you after all.

1794
02:49:55,879 --> 02:49:56,840
Forget that!

1795
02:49:56,840 --> 02:49:58,200
You gotta send me back!

1796
02:49:58,200 --> 02:50:00,440
I wasn't done haunting people yet!

1797
02:50:00,440 --> 02:50:02,520
Oh, Max.

1798
02:50:02,520 --> 02:50:06,120
You and Sam will be dead soon enough.

1799
02:50:06,120 --> 02:50:06,920
I'll wait in the-

1800
02:50:06,920 --> 02:50:07,959
What is this? What are you linking?

1801
02:50:07,959 --> 02:50:09,399
I've saw, I've seen that already.

1802
02:50:09,399 --> 02:50:14,760
Hold until you're prepared to release all three of us to smite the demon.

1803
02:50:20,069 --> 02:50:21,270
Alright, socks.

1804
02:50:21,270 --> 02:50:23,510
We need a pair of socks.

1805
02:50:23,510 --> 02:50:28,229
I'm excited, disappointed, over-socialized, and more than a little gassy.

1806
02:50:28,229 --> 02:50:31,239
Get me back to the sock machine.

1807
02:50:31,879 --> 02:50:42,329
It was a bunch of bullshit.

1808
02:50:42,329 --> 02:50:45,930
You guys just wanted me to say the word, like, feet and stinky.

1809
02:50:46,649 --> 02:50:48,899
Together.

1810
02:50:48,899 --> 02:50:49,620
And it worked.

1811
02:50:49,620 --> 02:50:50,659
You did a very good job.

1812
02:50:52,870 --> 02:50:54,709
You did a great, great work.

1813
02:50:55,350 --> 02:51:01,670
Here, print out.

1814
02:51:01,670 --> 02:51:02,469
Candle hell.

1815
02:51:02,469 --> 02:51:03,030
Deceased.

1816
02:51:03,670 --> 02:51:05,110
Sock full of flowers.

1817
02:51:05,110 --> 02:51:06,229
Richard N.

1818
02:51:06,229 --> 02:51:06,629
Liar.

1819
02:51:07,190 --> 02:51:08,069
Sock full of coal.

1820
02:51:09,819 --> 02:51:10,620
Richard.

1821
02:51:10,620 --> 02:51:11,180
Jason B.

1822
02:51:11,819 --> 02:51:12,700
Liar.

1823
02:51:12,700 --> 02:51:13,979
Sock full of coal.

1824
02:51:13,979 --> 02:51:14,940
Patches.

1825
02:51:14,940 --> 02:51:15,819
Good boy.

1826
02:51:15,819 --> 02:51:16,299
Patches.

1827
02:51:16,299 --> 02:51:17,180
Sock full of chew toys.

1828
02:51:17,819 --> 02:51:19,260
Dr. Catherine D.

1829
02:51:19,260 --> 02:51:20,299
Upstanding citizen.

1830
02:51:20,860 --> 02:51:21,819
Sock full of toys.

1831
02:51:22,219 --> 02:51:23,420
George W.

1832
02:51:23,420 --> 02:51:24,299
Liar.

1833
02:51:24,299 --> 02:51:25,180
Sock full of coal.

1834
02:51:26,059 --> 02:51:27,180
Annabelle L.

1835
02:51:27,180 --> 02:51:27,899
Deceased.

1836
02:51:27,899 --> 02:51:28,219
Okay.

1837
02:51:28,219 --> 02:51:28,940
Richard N.

1838
02:51:29,899 --> 02:51:30,860
I don't think that matters.

1839
02:51:45,270 --> 02:51:47,510
Ahhhh, god.

1840
02:51:49,180 --> 02:51:53,000
Damn it.

1841
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:55,000
It's a torture me Elmer doll.

1842
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:59,399
Look, he comes with his own breakable spirit and detachable retinas.

1843
02:52:02,860 --> 02:52:04,219
It couldn't have been that easy, right?

1844
02:52:05,909 --> 02:52:06,950
I need socks.

1845
02:52:07,670 --> 02:52:09,479
I need socks.

1846
02:52:09,559 --> 02:52:13,079
I need to find a sock to put the coal in so I can power the sleigh so I can...

1847
02:52:16,469 --> 02:52:18,790
I'm just gonna go back to the real world.

1848
02:52:22,600 --> 02:52:23,399
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1849
02:52:23,399 --> 02:52:24,440
Can you get socks from...

1850
02:52:24,440 --> 02:52:24,760
Hold on.

1851
02:52:24,760 --> 02:52:26,440
There's actual toys in here.

1852
02:52:26,440 --> 02:52:52,170
Computer.

1853
02:52:52,170 --> 02:52:53,930
Foot bath and piranha query.

1854
02:52:54,729 --> 02:52:56,489
Too bad the piranha are sold separately.

1855
02:52:57,129 --> 02:52:58,329
Let's attach a gift tag.

1856
02:53:01,129 --> 02:53:01,850
Who's it for?

1857
02:53:04,489 --> 02:53:05,530
Stinky might like that.

1858
02:53:11,340 --> 02:53:11,979
Quick, run!

1859
02:53:12,620 --> 02:53:21,819
Joke's on you.

1860
02:53:21,819 --> 02:53:23,340
The chat wasn't being creepy.

1861
02:53:23,979 --> 02:53:24,700
Well, they were.

1862
02:53:24,700 --> 02:53:25,180
They were.

1863
02:53:25,180 --> 02:53:25,899
Very much so.

1864
02:53:26,700 --> 02:53:28,219
But I thought I was getting...

1865
02:53:28,219 --> 02:53:30,139
I thought it was like a defeat meme on Switch.

1866
02:53:31,020 --> 02:53:31,739
Apparently not.

1867
02:53:32,549 --> 02:53:34,149
Let's head back to civilization.

1868
02:53:34,149 --> 02:53:35,110
Or what's left of it.

1869
02:53:37,079 --> 02:53:41,319
I was trying so hard to think of another solution around that.

1870
02:53:41,319 --> 02:53:43,079
But it actually was the solution.

1871
02:53:43,079 --> 02:53:44,520
Because I thought everybody was just doing like,

1872
02:53:44,520 --> 02:53:45,559
Yeah, she's got feet.

1873
02:53:45,559 --> 02:53:46,059
She's...

1874
02:53:46,760 --> 02:53:53,959
It's this way.

1875
02:53:59,079 --> 02:54:00,360
That's gonna be like on the counter.

1876
02:54:00,360 --> 02:54:03,799
Oh, that foot bath was heavy.

1877
02:54:03,799 --> 02:54:08,280
My feet haven't felt that good since that hot oil massage from Barack Obama.

1878
02:54:08,280 --> 02:54:10,440
It smells like you've got a new item on the menu, too.

1879
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:15,799
Now I can find the strength to keep serving these poor sweet spoiled imbeciles.

1880
02:54:22,250 --> 02:54:24,250
This smelly old sock could come in handy.

1881
02:54:44,200 --> 02:54:46,440
That was the thing that I thought was never gonna happen

1882
02:54:46,440 --> 02:54:48,360
because everyone was saying it was gonna happen.

1883
02:54:48,920 --> 02:54:50,040
Where to, Sam?

1884
02:54:50,040 --> 02:54:52,440
I was trying to just subvert it so much.

1885
02:54:54,969 --> 02:54:55,370
Oh well.

1886
02:54:55,370 --> 02:54:56,809
We're off to the North Pole.

1887
02:54:57,770 --> 02:55:08,819
See you guys.

1888
02:55:17,510 --> 02:55:19,510
Chad is becoming the voice in Jerma's head

1889
02:55:19,510 --> 02:55:21,430
that is always right that he never believes.

1890
02:55:32,069 --> 02:55:33,110
Always right.

1891
02:55:33,110 --> 02:55:33,610
Okay.

1892
02:55:36,200 --> 02:55:39,159
Hang back on the extreme backpack there.

1893
02:55:40,729 --> 02:55:41,850
Always right.

1894
02:56:02,979 --> 02:56:04,500
At least one guy is right in Chad.

1895
02:56:04,500 --> 02:56:05,139
At all times.

1896
02:56:07,139 --> 02:56:07,940
Yeah, I mean that's...

1897
02:56:08,659 --> 02:56:11,379
But you're just talking about like a sample statistic here.

1898
02:56:12,870 --> 02:56:14,950
There's 3,000 people here.

1899
02:56:16,180 --> 02:56:17,620
Somebody's gonna be right.

1900
02:56:17,620 --> 02:56:19,459
At least 10 of you.

1901
02:56:19,459 --> 02:56:20,420
100 of you, maybe.

1902
02:56:23,530 --> 02:56:24,090
What do you mean?

1903
02:56:25,209 --> 02:56:26,809
If you get a thousand people in a room

1904
02:56:26,809 --> 02:56:28,489
and you ask them all a hard question,

1905
02:56:28,489 --> 02:56:30,170
at least a dozen of them will get it right.

1906
02:56:33,879 --> 02:56:34,440
So Chad is...

1907
02:56:34,440 --> 02:56:36,360
No, some of Chad is always right.

1908
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:38,840
Most of Chad is always wrong.

1909
02:56:46,819 --> 02:56:47,540
That's true.

1910
02:56:48,500 --> 02:56:50,260
Some of Chad is right

1911
02:56:50,260 --> 02:56:52,260
and most of Chad is wrong.

1912
02:56:52,260 --> 02:56:52,500
Right?

1913
02:56:55,799 --> 02:56:56,520
I'm not...

1914
02:56:56,520 --> 02:56:58,120
Think about how many times you've said something

1915
02:56:58,120 --> 02:56:59,159
that it was correct.

1916
02:57:00,120 --> 02:57:01,959
You're one of like the 20 to 30 percent

1917
02:57:01,959 --> 02:57:02,760
that gets it right.

1918
02:57:18,649 --> 02:57:20,329
We need more research for that conclusion.

1919
02:57:25,829 --> 02:57:28,069
What an unexpected stroke of luck.

1920
02:57:28,069 --> 02:57:29,750
Is this another mastermind thing?

1921
02:57:30,629 --> 02:57:32,389
Well, you're talking mega-line.

1922
02:57:32,389 --> 02:57:33,590
An effort to save Christmas

1923
02:57:33,590 --> 02:57:36,309
and drove it recklessly into a hellish vision of the future

1924
02:57:36,309 --> 02:57:38,549
very much like the one we're standing in now.

1925
02:57:38,549 --> 02:57:41,350
I stopped paying attention halfway through that sentence.

1926
02:57:41,350 --> 02:57:44,389
I wonder if our ghosts are here guiding us right now.

1927
02:57:44,389 --> 02:57:45,989
Hey, past me!

1928
02:57:45,989 --> 02:57:47,430
Check this out!

1929
02:57:47,430 --> 02:57:48,389
Shake that thing!

1930
02:57:49,110 --> 02:57:51,030
Classy as always, little pal.

1931
02:57:51,030 --> 02:57:52,149
Now let's get out of here.

1932
02:57:53,510 --> 02:57:56,280
We get it.

1933
02:57:56,360 --> 02:58:00,760
I have closed all outlying portals.

1934
02:58:01,899 --> 02:58:04,379
Hey, you could stand to lose a few yourself, smart guy.

1935
02:58:09,979 --> 02:58:11,659
Chad is always right.

1936
02:58:13,219 --> 02:58:14,260
Right, if you could say that.

1937
02:58:14,260 --> 02:58:16,340
We saved Christmas for our future selves.

1938
02:58:16,340 --> 02:58:17,860
Chad collectively is...

1939
02:58:17,860 --> 02:58:19,860
Some of them will be right, so Chad would be right.

1940
02:58:21,260 --> 02:58:22,940
But that's not how it works.

1941
02:58:22,940 --> 02:58:25,260
That means he'll help us take care of our demon problem.

1942
02:58:25,260 --> 02:58:26,139
What's he gonna do?

1943
02:58:26,139 --> 02:58:27,579
Give him the silent treatment?

1944
02:58:28,299 --> 02:58:31,639
Oh, stop!

1945
02:58:32,329 --> 02:58:32,829
Hey!

1946
02:58:33,530 --> 02:58:35,530
Never underestimate the power of passive aggression.

1947
02:58:35,530 --> 02:58:37,290
But that would also make Chad wrong, too.

1948
02:58:37,850 --> 02:58:40,649
Yes, Chad is right and wrong at the same time.

1949
02:58:45,270 --> 02:58:47,030
By the way, opinions are not facts.

1950
02:58:47,030 --> 02:58:47,590
Let's just get that.

1951
02:58:47,590 --> 02:58:49,190
So, Jerma is short.

1952
02:58:49,190 --> 02:58:50,309
Oh, we can all agree on that.

1953
02:58:50,309 --> 02:58:51,270
That's an opinion of yours.

1954
02:58:52,600 --> 02:58:56,860
If somebody was like 5'5", or like 5'2",

1955
02:58:57,579 --> 02:58:58,780
I would be taller than them

1956
02:58:58,780 --> 02:59:01,500
and they wouldn't think I was short.

1957
02:59:01,500 --> 02:59:02,459
So, that's an...

1958
02:59:02,459 --> 02:59:08,780
If I went to like a village of people that were like 2' tall at some point,

1959
02:59:08,780 --> 02:59:10,790
I don't know, I would be tall.

1960
02:59:10,790 --> 02:59:11,510
That would be their opinion.

1961
02:59:11,510 --> 02:59:12,469
Oh, you're kind of tall.

1962
02:59:13,799 --> 02:59:15,399
So, that's an opinion of yours.

1963
02:59:15,399 --> 02:59:16,280
That's not a fact.

1964
02:59:21,500 --> 02:59:23,020
So, I have all the Christmas spirits.

1965
02:59:25,020 --> 02:59:25,899
Hey, demon!

1966
02:59:25,899 --> 02:59:26,540
Cut that out!

1967
02:59:37,989 --> 02:59:39,989
I was supposed to take the spirits and...

1968
02:59:39,989 --> 02:59:41,510
What was I supposed to do with them?

1969
02:59:41,510 --> 02:59:42,229
Give them to Santa?

1970
02:59:45,209 --> 02:59:45,690
What are you doing?

1971
02:59:45,690 --> 02:59:46,090
I just...

1972
02:59:46,090 --> 02:59:46,809
We were talking about...

1973
02:59:48,329 --> 02:59:50,620
We were talking about shitting.

1974
03:00:05,799 --> 03:00:07,500
What are you doing in the game?

1975
03:00:07,500 --> 03:00:08,139
Yeah, we were talking.

1976
03:00:08,139 --> 03:00:08,700
I wasn't like...

1977
03:00:08,700 --> 03:00:11,180
I was focusing on speaking about opinions.

1978
03:00:13,899 --> 03:00:15,100
What size shoe do you wear?

1979
03:00:15,100 --> 03:00:15,600
14.

1980
03:00:33,739 --> 03:00:35,100
Happy New Year, everybody.

1981
03:00:37,610 --> 03:00:40,969
Well, I hope you boys have learned your lesson.

1982
03:00:40,969 --> 03:00:42,649
It was a series of honest mistakes.

1983
03:00:43,450 --> 03:00:47,370
Keep us on the nice list and nobody has to see this videotape of you

1984
03:00:47,370 --> 03:00:49,770
wetting yourself and screaming like a campfire girl.

1985
03:00:51,209 --> 03:00:53,049
You rapscallions!

1986
03:00:53,049 --> 03:00:55,690
Rattle on to bed, both of you!

1987
03:00:55,690 --> 03:00:59,049
Ready for visions of sugar plums to dance in your head, little buddy?

1988
03:00:59,049 --> 03:01:00,649
It'd be better than the night terrace.

1989
03:01:00,649 --> 03:01:01,370
I got a size 10.

1990
03:01:01,370 --> 03:01:03,290
Ho, ho, ho!

1991
03:01:03,290 --> 03:01:04,090
Jello!

1992
03:01:04,729 --> 03:01:05,610
Sinful.

1993
03:01:06,569 --> 03:01:07,370
Santa!

1994
03:01:08,090 --> 03:01:08,569
No!

1995
03:01:08,569 --> 03:01:09,069
Uh-oh.

1996
03:01:12,200 --> 03:01:14,200
Eat the jello!

1997
03:01:17,659 --> 03:01:19,510
That feels so good.

1998
03:01:22,360 --> 03:01:27,450
So wait, that was all for nothing?

1999
03:01:28,090 --> 03:01:29,770
The whole episode was for no reason?

2000
03:01:43,270 --> 03:01:44,870
All right, this is where it comes in play here.

2001
03:01:49,110 --> 03:01:53,979
Okay, yep, we planned for this.

2002
03:01:55,209 --> 03:01:58,649
So we've got to move this over there.

2003
03:02:01,350 --> 03:02:02,629
And then we've got to move this.

2004
03:02:05,350 --> 03:02:07,750
We've got to move that.

2005
03:02:07,750 --> 03:02:08,709
Shoot that.

2006
03:02:08,709 --> 03:02:09,590
Drop it on his head.

2007
03:02:09,590 --> 03:02:10,309
Trampoline.

2008
03:02:11,030 --> 03:02:14,860
We've got to get that.

2009
03:02:14,860 --> 03:02:17,260
We've got to move this over here.

2010
03:02:17,899 --> 03:02:19,340
Stop it over the trampoline.

2011
03:02:21,719 --> 03:02:23,000
And then shoot it with a cannon.

2012
03:02:24,309 --> 03:02:25,430
And the cannon's going to break that.

2013
03:02:25,430 --> 03:02:27,030
It's going to bounce and hit him in the head.

2014
03:02:27,030 --> 03:02:27,909
No, it's not.

2015
03:02:27,909 --> 03:02:29,750
What we've got to do here is we've got to shoot this.

2016
03:02:31,030 --> 03:02:36,059
Shoot the, uh, I've got to, how do I move the cannon?

2017
03:02:45,030 --> 03:02:45,510
Gift.

2018
03:02:45,510 --> 03:02:46,709
Christmas present.

2019
03:02:46,709 --> 03:02:48,379
We've got to shoot.

2020
03:02:51,180 --> 03:02:51,680
Oops.

2021
03:02:52,659 --> 03:02:53,540
Shoot the present.

2022
03:02:53,540 --> 03:02:54,659
Onto the trampoline.

2023
03:02:55,879 --> 03:02:56,600
Oh, fuck.

2024
03:02:57,860 --> 03:02:59,940
Shoot the, shoot the cannon.

2025
03:02:59,940 --> 03:03:00,739
Shoot the present.

2026
03:03:00,739 --> 03:03:01,379
Present.

2027
03:03:01,379 --> 03:03:01,940
Explodes.

2028
03:03:02,819 --> 03:03:07,020
Shoot the cannon.

2029
03:03:07,659 --> 03:03:08,299
Hits the present.

2030
03:03:09,350 --> 03:03:09,909
Present.

2031
03:03:09,909 --> 03:03:11,270
Onto the backboard.

2032
03:03:12,620 --> 03:03:13,180
Backboard.

2033
03:03:14,579 --> 03:03:15,219
Goes over here.

2034
03:03:17,500 --> 03:03:18,000
Dump it.

2035
03:03:26,139 --> 03:03:32,579
Yeah, we finally did it at the time.

2036
03:03:33,940 --> 03:03:34,440
Oh.

2037
03:03:53,379 --> 03:03:53,879
Okay.

2038
03:03:53,879 --> 03:03:54,379
Wow.

2039
03:03:57,139 --> 03:03:57,940
Everybody.

2040
03:03:57,940 --> 03:03:59,299
It's almost dawn.

2041
03:03:59,299 --> 03:04:00,739
What are you standing around for?

2042
03:04:02,260 --> 03:04:08,180
We don't get to pull together and save Christmas for the kids of the world.

2043
03:04:08,180 --> 03:04:11,940
When have I ever done like a change the letters around joke to make another word?

2044
03:04:11,940 --> 03:04:12,659
That's never happened.

2045
03:04:12,659 --> 03:04:14,180
I can do the urinating.

2046
03:04:14,180 --> 03:04:15,299
It's opinion, not a fact.

2047
03:04:15,299 --> 03:04:17,780
And who could possibly deliver all the toys in time?

2048
03:04:18,979 --> 03:04:26,739
Read seven.

2049
03:04:26,739 --> 03:04:28,579
Merry Christmas.

2050
03:04:28,579 --> 03:04:29,079
Good luck.

2051
03:04:29,079 --> 03:04:29,860
Drink water.

2052
03:04:29,860 --> 03:04:33,290
So that was the Christmas episode.

2053
03:04:35,219 --> 03:04:38,180
Say Max, do you think we should have waited for them to load the presents

2054
03:04:38,180 --> 03:04:39,459
before we drove off?

2055
03:04:39,459 --> 03:04:40,819
What's the rush, Sam?

2056
03:04:40,819 --> 03:04:42,180
It's the middle of November.

2057
03:04:44,340 --> 03:04:51,319
Oh.

2058
03:04:51,319 --> 03:04:52,760
Ice Station Santa.

2059
03:05:05,479 --> 03:05:05,979
Cool.

2060
03:05:06,360 --> 03:05:07,159
That was fun.

2061
03:05:07,799 --> 03:05:13,350
We're gonna take a pee break while the ending plays out

2062
03:05:13,350 --> 03:05:14,629
and then we're gonna go on to episode two.

2063
03:05:16,600 --> 03:05:17,719
Next episode when?

2064
03:05:17,719 --> 03:05:18,219
Right now.

2065
03:05:18,760 --> 03:05:20,219
You're about to see it.

2066
03:05:20,219 --> 03:05:27,620
All right.

2067
03:05:27,620 --> 03:05:28,420
I'll be right back.

2068
03:05:29,139 --> 03:05:31,420
This will just play out.

2069
03:05:32,059 --> 03:05:34,069
We'll see you in like two, three minutes.

2070
03:05:34,629 --> 03:08:43,750
Why is it taking so long to pee?

2071
03:08:43,829 --> 03:08:45,430
But I gotta get water, too.

2072
03:08:45,430 --> 03:08:48,459
Come on.

2073
03:08:48,459 --> 03:08:49,100
I gotta pee.

2074
03:08:49,100 --> 03:08:49,899
I gotta get water.

2075
03:08:49,899 --> 03:08:52,139
I gotta like stand up and shake around and move around a little.

2076
03:08:57,559 --> 03:08:59,530
Takes a few minutes.

2077
03:08:59,530 --> 03:09:00,649
Everyone always screams.

2078
03:09:01,290 --> 03:09:02,729
You're not hydrated enough.

2079
03:09:02,729 --> 03:09:03,530
You're gonna die.

2080
03:09:04,090 --> 03:09:05,260
Where the fuck is he?

2081
03:09:05,260 --> 03:09:06,139
Get back here now.

2082
03:09:07,209 --> 03:09:08,250
I was gonna get a water.

2083
03:09:08,250 --> 03:09:08,569
No.

2084
03:09:08,569 --> 03:09:09,069
No.

2085
03:09:09,610 --> 03:09:10,110
Now.

2086
03:09:10,950 --> 03:09:11,450
Okay.

2087
03:09:12,920 --> 03:09:14,840
But drink some water.

2088
03:09:14,840 --> 03:09:15,639
For God's sakes.

2089
03:09:15,639 --> 03:09:21,940
You're shriveling up.

2090
03:09:21,940 --> 03:09:22,440
Sorry.

2091
03:09:24,020 --> 03:09:24,520
All right.

2092
03:09:25,270 --> 03:09:26,469
Let's do episode two.

2093
03:09:35,030 --> 03:09:36,389
You guys are like a grandma.

2094
03:09:38,299 --> 03:09:39,340
Dear, dear.

2095
03:09:39,340 --> 03:09:40,299
Please come in.

2096
03:09:40,299 --> 03:09:40,799
Yes.

2097
03:09:41,579 --> 03:09:42,379
You have no idea.

2098
03:09:42,379 --> 03:09:43,100
Look at you.

2099
03:09:43,100 --> 03:09:44,540
You haven't eaten in forever.

2100
03:09:44,540 --> 03:09:45,020
Get in here.

2101
03:09:45,020 --> 03:09:46,139
Let me get you some cookies.

2102
03:09:47,510 --> 03:09:47,989
Oh, yes.

2103
03:09:47,989 --> 03:09:49,190
You love cookies.

2104
03:09:49,190 --> 03:09:50,389
No, have a steak, too.

2105
03:09:50,389 --> 03:09:52,309
Let grandma will take care of you.

2106
03:09:52,309 --> 03:09:54,090
You know, you look a little fat today.

2107
03:09:54,729 --> 03:09:58,409
Hey, I think you need to go outside more often and get some exercise.

2108
03:10:11,829 --> 03:10:15,030
There's the Adam Sandler voice again.

2109
03:10:15,750 --> 03:10:16,469
That's the guy.

2110
03:10:16,469 --> 03:10:18,069
That's probably an Adam Sandler joke.

2111
03:10:18,889 --> 03:10:20,170
I definitely didn't make that up.

2112
03:10:20,170 --> 03:10:21,799
Somebody else did.

2113
03:10:21,799 --> 03:10:23,399
That's been a thing for a long time.

2114
03:10:23,959 --> 03:10:25,559
Adam Sandler probably made that up, too.

2115
03:10:35,450 --> 03:10:38,139
Adam Sandler was funny, you know,

2116
03:10:38,139 --> 03:10:41,180
before he started doing a Netflix movie every three months.

2117
03:10:42,629 --> 03:10:45,590
He was funny like 10, 20 years ago.

2118
03:10:45,590 --> 03:10:54,659
What do you mean he wasn't funny ever?

2119
03:10:54,659 --> 03:10:56,100
He was funny on Saturday Night Live.

2120
03:10:59,399 --> 03:11:01,639
Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison.

2121
03:11:01,639 --> 03:11:06,950
Those movies were actually pretty funny.

2122
03:11:06,950 --> 03:11:08,950
Just because his movies are not good now.

2123
03:11:16,870 --> 03:11:29,020
Like his like mid to late 90s movies were pretty good.

2124
03:11:29,020 --> 03:11:32,700
That was like the heyday I said that Chris Farley, Adam Sandler,

2125
03:11:33,430 --> 03:11:38,870
Dana Carvey, David Spade, Chris Rock.

2126
03:11:38,870 --> 03:11:41,430
Come on.

2127
03:11:41,430 --> 03:11:44,040
That was like the golden years.

2128
03:11:47,610 --> 03:11:49,450
All not particularly funny people.

2129
03:11:49,450 --> 03:11:50,250
Holy shit.

2130
03:11:50,969 --> 03:11:56,840
I'm too old for this.

2131
03:11:59,180 --> 03:12:00,379
Who's funny now?

2132
03:12:00,379 --> 03:12:05,100
Who would you compare to Chris Rock that's funnier now?

2133
03:12:07,639 --> 03:12:09,879
Somebody just, Ninja.

2134
03:12:23,350 --> 03:12:24,469
Bill Burr is hilarious,

2135
03:12:24,469 --> 03:12:34,569
but Bill Burr has also been around for a long time.

2136
03:12:34,569 --> 03:12:35,370
All right.

2137
03:12:35,370 --> 03:12:57,579
Okay, before I have a meltdown, anyone you don't like.

2138
03:13:01,690 --> 03:13:02,250
All right, let me.

2139
03:13:03,049 --> 03:13:03,690
Okay, here we go.

2140
03:13:05,590 --> 03:13:07,690
Quit this episode two.

2141
03:13:08,569 --> 03:13:09,049
Give me a moment.

2142
03:13:09,049 --> 03:13:12,790
It's actually kind of opening these old games.

2143
03:13:12,790 --> 03:13:15,350
They require a lot of care and attention.

2144
03:13:15,989 --> 03:13:18,469
So I'm going to mute the audio so I don't hurt anybody.

2145
03:13:22,969 --> 03:13:26,090
I have to change the title too, to make it episode two.

2146
03:13:26,649 --> 03:13:30,360
Which is uh, Moi Better Blues.

2147
03:13:30,920 --> 03:13:32,200
Here we go.

2148
03:13:32,280 --> 03:13:35,079
I have to do all the settings again.

2149
03:13:42,979 --> 03:13:43,459
Why is it not?

2150
03:13:43,459 --> 03:13:46,700
There we go.

2151
03:13:46,700 --> 03:13:47,899
Do I drink tap water?

2152
03:13:50,379 --> 03:13:51,180
Technically, yes.

2153
03:13:53,959 --> 03:13:55,879
I mean, it comes out of the tap.

2154
03:13:55,879 --> 03:13:58,120
I don't drink it right from the tap though.

2155
03:13:58,120 --> 03:13:58,760
It's filtered.

2156
03:14:03,290 --> 03:14:03,690
Hold on.

2157
03:14:03,690 --> 03:14:04,010
I'm sorry.

2158
03:14:04,010 --> 03:14:04,250
Sorry.

2159
03:14:04,250 --> 03:14:05,209
Wait, wait, wait.

2160
03:14:05,209 --> 03:14:12,819
Pause.

2161
03:14:12,819 --> 03:14:14,739
No, I have a water filter.

2162
03:14:14,739 --> 03:14:16,739
So the tap water goes through the water filter,

2163
03:14:16,739 --> 03:14:17,860
and then I drank it.

2164
03:14:17,860 --> 03:14:19,780
It's a good filter.

2165
03:14:19,780 --> 03:14:20,100
Don't worry.

2166
03:14:22,409 --> 03:14:24,010
Let's get this on here.

2167
03:14:32,620 --> 03:14:33,180
There we go.

2168
03:14:33,819 --> 03:14:38,059
The audio seems to be okay though.

2169
03:14:38,620 --> 03:14:40,709
I hope it is.

2170
03:14:44,260 --> 03:14:46,020
That's such an American thing to do,

2171
03:14:46,020 --> 03:14:47,299
to filter your water.

2172
03:14:48,020 --> 03:14:51,129
There's a lot of fucked up shit that is in water.

2173
03:14:55,909 --> 03:14:57,829
How is it American to filter your water?

2174
03:15:01,530 --> 03:15:03,290
EU stream was yesterday.

2175
03:15:03,290 --> 03:15:04,489
You may have missed it.

2176
03:15:04,489 --> 03:15:09,500
Let me make sure that's all set.

2177
03:15:10,059 --> 03:15:11,959
Now I'm going to change the title.

2178
03:15:11,959 --> 03:15:15,030
Episode two.

2179
03:15:15,030 --> 03:15:16,229
Oh, two.

2180
03:15:16,870 --> 03:15:17,799
There it is.

2181
03:15:17,799 --> 03:15:18,520
Let me update it.

2182
03:15:20,200 --> 03:15:20,440
All right.

2183
03:15:20,440 --> 03:15:22,520
We're officially ready to play episode two.

2184
03:15:28,969 --> 03:15:31,290
Good time coming back from the North Pole, Amax.

2185
03:15:31,290 --> 03:15:33,209
If you say so, Miss Daisy.

2186
03:15:33,209 --> 03:15:34,170
If I'd been driving,

2187
03:15:34,170 --> 03:15:36,409
it wouldn't have taken us a whole month to get home.

2188
03:15:36,409 --> 03:15:38,409
Well, I've got to go drain the DeSoto.

2189
03:15:38,409 --> 03:15:40,889
You should have taken care of that before we left.

2190
03:15:40,889 --> 03:15:42,809
Somebody insisted that we drive through

2191
03:15:42,809 --> 03:15:44,329
the Hudson Bay with the top down.

2192
03:15:49,979 --> 03:15:53,209
What the hell was that all about?

2193
03:15:53,209 --> 03:15:54,250
That's what I said.

2194
03:15:54,250 --> 03:15:56,090
Unless I miss my guess,

2195
03:15:56,090 --> 03:15:58,729
Sybil's being pursued by some kind of rogue,

2196
03:15:58,729 --> 03:16:00,809
semi-sentient, interdimensional portal.

2197
03:16:02,489 --> 03:16:08,629
Think we should try to help her?

2198
03:16:08,629 --> 03:16:09,989
Can't think of anything better to do.

2199
03:16:11,190 --> 03:16:14,489
All right.

2200
03:16:14,489 --> 03:16:15,290
So at its peak,

2201
03:16:16,520 --> 03:16:20,760
how much was the Max's head in United States dollars?

2202
03:16:28,340 --> 03:16:30,020
No matter how many fires we cause,

2203
03:16:30,020 --> 03:16:32,020
this baby keeps 70 to 80 bucks.

2204
03:16:32,020 --> 03:16:32,340
Yeah.

2205
03:16:32,340 --> 03:16:34,180
And without complaining about it,

2206
03:16:34,180 --> 03:16:36,420
not like all those uppity firefighters.

2207
03:16:37,379 --> 03:16:41,590
Is it still worth some money, isn't it?

2208
03:16:43,110 --> 03:16:44,309
Have to do anything with the robot?

2209
03:16:44,309 --> 03:16:45,270
Well, well.

2210
03:16:45,270 --> 03:16:47,590
We were wondering where you'd scampered off to.

2211
03:16:47,590 --> 03:16:49,430
What are you doing just standing there?

2212
03:16:49,510 --> 03:16:50,629
Stop that thing.

2213
03:16:50,629 --> 03:16:51,270
What do you want me to do?

2214
03:16:51,270 --> 03:16:53,590
You already sucked up Big Otis and T-Bone.

2215
03:16:56,200 --> 03:16:57,799
It's some kind of semi-sentient,

2216
03:16:57,799 --> 03:16:59,000
interdimensional portal.

2217
03:16:59,000 --> 03:16:59,319
Okay.

2218
03:17:00,819 --> 03:17:01,780
Don't have to shoot it.

2219
03:17:02,579 --> 03:17:05,989
When it comes back around,

2220
03:17:05,989 --> 03:17:06,629
I'm just gonna shoot it.

2221
03:17:07,190 --> 03:17:14,340
Well, I would have stopped it,

2222
03:17:14,340 --> 03:17:14,739
wouldn't it?

2223
03:17:18,059 --> 03:17:19,260
Throw a parking meter.

2224
03:17:21,879 --> 03:17:22,680
Make it the water.

2225
03:17:22,680 --> 03:17:23,559
Have water shoot out.

2226
03:17:24,280 --> 03:17:27,299
It's some kind of...

2227
03:17:27,940 --> 03:17:28,340
Okay.

2228
03:17:28,340 --> 03:17:29,299
What about Bosco's?

2229
03:17:38,840 --> 03:17:39,639
Hey, Bosco.

2230
03:17:39,639 --> 03:17:41,239
What do you know about suddenly appearing

2231
03:17:41,239 --> 03:17:42,840
interdimensional portals?

2232
03:17:42,840 --> 03:17:44,200
I hear a lot of things.

2233
03:17:44,200 --> 03:17:45,319
What does it look like?

2234
03:17:45,319 --> 03:17:48,120
Three sides, reddish, chasing Sybil.

2235
03:17:48,120 --> 03:17:51,239
Oh, what you've got there is a Bermuda Triangle.

2236
03:17:51,239 --> 03:17:52,600
Bermuda Triangle.

2237
03:17:52,600 --> 03:17:54,200
Why didn't we think of that?

2238
03:17:54,200 --> 03:17:55,799
Wait, chasing Sybil?

2239
03:17:55,799 --> 03:17:57,159
You mean it's here?

2240
03:17:57,159 --> 03:17:58,520
Oh, that ain't good.

2241
03:17:58,520 --> 03:17:59,559
That ain't good at all.

2242
03:18:01,000 --> 03:18:04,040
Uh, shouldn't the Bermuda Triangle be in Bermuda?

2243
03:18:04,840 --> 03:18:07,559
What's the Bermuda Triangle doing all the way up here?

2244
03:18:07,559 --> 03:18:09,799
Sometimes they just like to wander.

2245
03:18:09,799 --> 03:18:13,799
Unless it was summoned by T-H-E-M.

2246
03:18:14,760 --> 03:18:15,879
This thing again.

2247
03:18:15,879 --> 03:18:16,200
Okay.

2248
03:18:17,639 --> 03:18:18,840
Who controls the Triangle?

2249
03:18:18,840 --> 03:18:19,879
Who's controlling the Triangle here?

2250
03:18:19,879 --> 03:18:21,159
I told you.

2251
03:18:21,159 --> 03:18:23,159
T-H-E-M.

2252
03:18:23,159 --> 03:18:26,120
I really hope you're talking about the giant ants this time.

2253
03:18:26,120 --> 03:18:27,479
Giant ants?

2254
03:18:27,479 --> 03:18:28,760
That's crazy.

2255
03:18:28,760 --> 03:18:32,040
I'm talking about the mysterious cabal of controllers

2256
03:18:32,040 --> 03:18:35,399
who summon the Triangle's Ascension portals

2257
03:18:35,399 --> 03:18:37,079
to do their dark bidding.

2258
03:18:37,079 --> 03:18:38,520
Well, that makes sense.

2259
03:18:38,520 --> 03:18:41,000
If there's a Triangle in our neighborhood,

2260
03:18:41,000 --> 03:18:42,920
that means they're coming.

2261
03:18:43,879 --> 03:18:44,280
All right.

2262
03:18:45,639 --> 03:18:48,120
Oh, how do we stop this Triangle?

2263
03:18:48,120 --> 03:18:50,440
Once a Triangle gets imprinted on you,

2264
03:18:50,440 --> 03:18:51,879
it's tough to shake it.

2265
03:18:51,879 --> 03:18:53,879
But they say you can train them

2266
03:18:53,879 --> 03:18:56,520
if you can figure out how to communicate with them.

2267
03:18:56,520 --> 03:18:57,020
Okay.

2268
03:18:58,040 --> 03:19:00,579
How do we communicate with the Triangle?

2269
03:19:00,579 --> 03:19:03,700
They're very attracted to Symbols and Sigils.

2270
03:19:03,700 --> 03:19:05,540
Symbols and Sigils.

2271
03:19:05,540 --> 03:19:06,659
Those two.

2272
03:19:06,659 --> 03:19:08,180
They're not real picky.

2273
03:19:08,180 --> 03:19:10,500
They're driven by shapes and colors.

2274
03:19:10,500 --> 03:19:13,540
A pink rhombus makes it nostalgic for the people.

2275
03:19:13,540 --> 03:19:14,659
Pink rhombus.

2276
03:19:14,659 --> 03:19:15,379
Red octagon.

2277
03:19:15,379 --> 03:19:16,420
Makes it stop whatever it's doing.

2278
03:19:16,420 --> 03:19:17,059
I need a red octagon.

2279
03:19:17,059 --> 03:19:20,739
A blue icosahedron makes it sit in its mom's basement

2280
03:19:20,739 --> 03:19:22,659
and draw maps of dungeons.

2281
03:19:22,659 --> 03:19:24,340
And they can't see or hear.

2282
03:19:24,340 --> 03:19:27,700
So you've got to feed them a symbol of what you want them to do.

2283
03:19:27,700 --> 03:19:29,139
Okay, so we need an octagon.

2284
03:19:30,899 --> 03:19:33,799
We'd like to buy something.

2285
03:19:33,799 --> 03:19:35,559
I told you, fools, last time.

2286
03:19:35,559 --> 03:19:37,239
The store is closed.

2287
03:19:37,239 --> 03:19:40,840
But I've been craving a pack of beef tarts for weeks now.

2288
03:19:40,840 --> 03:19:43,799
It's the delicious tangy candy that makes its own gravy.

2289
03:19:43,799 --> 03:19:44,840
Help us out, Bosko.

2290
03:19:44,840 --> 03:19:45,479
That sounds pretty good.

2291
03:19:45,479 --> 03:19:46,760
Stop wasting my time.

2292
03:19:46,760 --> 03:19:48,760
I'll never get the bunker ready if you two keep chatting.

2293
03:19:48,760 --> 03:19:50,520
Some of these comedy foods I would love to eat.

2294
03:20:00,739 --> 03:20:02,579
You can't close the store, Bosko.

2295
03:20:02,579 --> 03:20:05,700
Everything we value is bought or shoplifted from here.

2296
03:20:05,700 --> 03:20:06,739
Don't you see?

2297
03:20:06,739 --> 03:20:08,500
The end is nigh!

2298
03:20:08,500 --> 03:20:09,459
Nigh?

2299
03:20:09,459 --> 03:20:10,819
Yes, nigh!

2300
03:20:10,819 --> 03:20:12,899
Wandering Bermuda Triangles.

2301
03:20:12,899 --> 03:20:15,219
Strange radio transmission.

2302
03:20:15,299 --> 03:20:16,500
Don't you see?

2303
03:20:16,500 --> 03:20:18,579
It's T-H-E-M!

2304
03:20:18,579 --> 03:20:19,700
They're coming!

2305
03:20:19,700 --> 03:20:22,420
I have to relocate before it's too late!

2306
03:20:22,420 --> 03:20:25,059
When your life is such a joke that you want to eat comedy food.

2307
03:20:29,319 --> 03:20:31,639
But like you didn't, like you've never wanted to have

2308
03:20:32,360 --> 03:20:33,719
like a donut from The Simpsons?

2309
03:20:35,459 --> 03:20:37,139
Like specifically from The Simpsons?

2310
03:20:43,139 --> 03:20:43,860
Come on.

2311
03:20:43,860 --> 03:20:44,659
Donuts are real.

2312
03:20:44,659 --> 03:20:45,700
That's a real food, though.

2313
03:20:49,159 --> 03:20:50,200
Oh, yeah.

2314
03:20:50,200 --> 03:20:58,409
Um, what about a, uh, everlasting gobstopper?

2315
03:20:58,969 --> 03:21:03,100
Those aren't real.

2316
03:21:03,100 --> 03:21:05,260
That's a fucking comedy food.

2317
03:21:05,819 --> 03:21:09,579
Those are real.

2318
03:21:09,579 --> 03:21:10,540
No, they're not.

2319
03:21:10,540 --> 03:21:13,340
Those aren't real.

2320
03:21:13,979 --> 03:21:16,860
Wonka was bought out by one company and they, uh, they do, they still,

2321
03:21:16,860 --> 03:21:17,899
only thing they do is nerds.

2322
03:21:18,540 --> 03:21:22,629
They don't do anything else anymore.

2323
03:21:22,629 --> 03:21:23,909
They don't have like Wonka bars anymore.

2324
03:21:23,909 --> 03:21:28,899
They don't, the Wonka the company went under.

2325
03:21:28,899 --> 03:21:30,100
They don't really exist anymore.

2326
03:21:30,659 --> 03:21:32,729
Look it up.

2327
03:21:33,370 --> 03:21:37,450
Why does the Bermuda Triangle have such a grudge against all those boats and planes?

2328
03:21:37,450 --> 03:21:39,930
Oh, the Triangle got a bad rap for that.

2329
03:21:39,930 --> 03:21:45,850
Scientists say those accidents were caused by sudden explosive outbursts of methane gas.

2330
03:21:46,489 --> 03:21:47,610
Speaking of which.

2331
03:21:48,329 --> 03:21:49,450
Max, don't.

2332
03:21:49,450 --> 03:21:50,329
What, Sam?

2333
03:21:50,329 --> 03:21:54,170
I was going to point out that many phenomena long believed to have paranormal causes

2334
03:21:54,170 --> 03:21:57,209
have actually turned out to be far more mundane in origin.

2335
03:21:57,209 --> 03:22:01,370
Only one phenomenon's tremendous power continues to baffle scientists.

2336
03:22:01,370 --> 03:22:03,690
Why do you always bring negative energy?

2337
03:22:04,489 --> 03:22:05,049
What's that?

2338
03:22:06,329 --> 03:22:19,399
All right, so let's, we need to get out here.

2339
03:22:19,399 --> 03:22:22,700
I'm gonna get a red, I'm gonna get octagon.

2340
03:22:23,420 --> 03:22:26,219
I wasn't laughing at that.

2341
03:22:26,219 --> 03:22:28,059
I was laughing at something, the thing that somebody said.

2342
03:22:28,700 --> 03:22:57,049
All right, we need, what do you, let's go to order.

2343
03:22:59,350 --> 03:23:00,309
Into Stanky's.

2344
03:23:00,309 --> 03:23:01,190
What about the toys?

2345
03:23:08,700 --> 03:23:09,500
Howdy, cops.

2346
03:23:09,500 --> 03:23:10,860
How's the auto body business?

2347
03:23:10,860 --> 03:23:13,420
How does it feel knowing you're the only person on Twitch streaming this game?

2348
03:23:16,360 --> 03:23:17,159
Doesn't surprise me.

2349
03:23:26,329 --> 03:23:27,610
All right, so we have to stop this.

2350
03:23:27,610 --> 03:23:28,809
We need an octagon.

2351
03:23:29,930 --> 03:23:30,889
Can we go into symbols?

2352
03:23:34,549 --> 03:23:35,670
Sibyl's office is closed.

2353
03:23:35,670 --> 03:23:37,510
What does she do now, anyway?

2354
03:23:37,510 --> 03:23:40,709
I don't know, but whatever it is, she's doing even less of it than usual.

2355
03:23:40,709 --> 03:23:44,549
Number one Sam and Max scream, screamer, streamer.

2356
03:23:45,909 --> 03:23:50,700
Oh, damn it, stupid spot.

2357
03:23:50,700 --> 03:23:51,020
Red.

2358
03:23:51,020 --> 03:23:51,979
Hi, you stinky.

2359
03:23:51,979 --> 03:23:53,899
Oh, it's you guys.

2360
03:23:53,899 --> 03:23:55,020
Hank and Jethro, was it?

2361
03:23:55,020 --> 03:23:55,420
Red, toaster.

2362
03:23:55,420 --> 03:23:56,780
Sam and Max, actually.

2363
03:23:56,780 --> 03:23:57,979
What are you doing?

2364
03:23:57,979 --> 03:23:59,819
What? I was just taking care of some cleaning.

2365
03:23:59,819 --> 03:24:01,020
Red, stoplight.

2366
03:24:01,819 --> 03:24:05,420
If that's a blood stain, you should be sure to use bleach.

2367
03:24:06,379 --> 03:24:08,299
I don't know what you're talking about.

2368
03:24:16,409 --> 03:24:20,090
Sadly, I think my days of pillaging coastal villages are now behind me.

2369
03:24:27,909 --> 03:24:28,790
Give me, give me.

2370
03:24:28,790 --> 03:24:30,309
Can we borrow your sign, stinky?

2371
03:24:30,309 --> 03:24:31,750
It's kind of important.

2372
03:24:31,750 --> 03:24:32,870
Well, okay.

2373
03:24:32,870 --> 03:24:33,750
But bring it back.

2374
03:24:33,750 --> 03:24:35,030
It's a national heirloom.

2375
03:24:35,030 --> 03:24:35,989
You made an octagon.

2376
03:24:35,989 --> 03:24:38,549
That will stop sign that would have prevented the Kennedy assassination

2377
03:24:38,549 --> 03:24:39,989
if Connolly hadn't run it.

2378
03:24:40,870 --> 03:24:41,590
He's blind.

2379
03:24:42,309 --> 03:24:42,549
What?

2380
03:24:44,299 --> 03:24:46,059
Yeah, they can't do everything instantly.

2381
03:24:46,780 --> 03:24:48,040
Oh my god.

2382
03:24:48,360 --> 03:24:50,629
Instantly.

2383
03:24:50,629 --> 03:24:53,590
I need to instantly do it in a second.

2384
03:24:56,969 --> 03:24:57,530
Look, Max.

2385
03:24:57,530 --> 03:24:59,290
It's our neighbor, Flint Paper.

2386
03:24:59,290 --> 03:25:00,329
Hiya, fellas.

2387
03:25:00,329 --> 03:25:02,329
Keep it on the down low, would ya?

2388
03:25:02,329 --> 03:25:04,250
I'm doing surveillance.

2389
03:25:04,250 --> 03:25:06,649
Oh boy, real detective work.

2390
03:25:06,649 --> 03:25:08,170
Who are you spying on?

2391
03:25:08,170 --> 03:25:10,250
Some bug, the name of Bosco.

2392
03:25:11,129 --> 03:25:15,370
Oh, so, wait, is this a, somebody's, okay.

2393
03:25:15,370 --> 03:25:18,409
Stinky's has no smoking unless you're Flint policy.

2394
03:25:18,409 --> 03:25:20,649
Sounds a lot like their policy on homicides.

2395
03:25:22,170 --> 03:25:25,770
Kitty litter, somebody gave a lot of money.

2396
03:25:27,260 --> 03:25:28,780
The Bala Koala, 50 bucks.

2397
03:25:28,780 --> 03:25:32,299
Thank you for the 50 dollars, 5,000 bits, 5,000 bits.

2398
03:25:32,299 --> 03:25:32,700
Thank you.

2399
03:25:34,250 --> 03:25:40,100
Bala Koala, huge cast drop, bit explosion there.

2400
03:25:40,100 --> 03:25:42,739
And they say, don't listen to chat.

2401
03:25:42,739 --> 03:25:43,299
They suck.

2402
03:25:49,690 --> 03:25:50,889
Thank you for the 50 dollars.

2403
03:25:50,889 --> 03:25:54,540
I mean, that's, that's the opinion.

2404
03:25:54,540 --> 03:25:56,860
No problem, the jukebox only takes 20s.

2405
03:25:58,629 --> 03:25:59,670
That's your opinion.

2406
03:26:00,309 --> 03:26:08,459
But I like him here for a second.

2407
03:26:08,459 --> 03:26:09,819
Yeah, yeah, no, come here.

2408
03:26:09,819 --> 03:26:13,319
Yep, nailed it, man.

2409
03:26:13,319 --> 03:26:16,389
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, they can't hear us.

2410
03:26:16,389 --> 03:26:17,989
No, that was fucking the livers.

2411
03:26:17,989 --> 03:26:19,190
Of course that's what I fucking think.

2412
03:26:19,989 --> 03:26:21,030
Get the fuck right in there, man.

2413
03:26:21,030 --> 03:26:21,989
Fucking thank you for that.

2414
03:26:22,790 --> 03:26:24,899
All right, thanks for coming out.

2415
03:26:24,899 --> 03:26:25,399
See you later.

2416
03:26:28,040 --> 03:26:39,719
Hey, there we go.

2417
03:26:39,719 --> 03:26:42,469
Now thanks for the 50 bucks.

2418
03:26:43,110 --> 03:26:46,069
Just wanted to, I wanted to just say thanks in person.

2419
03:26:46,069 --> 03:26:48,389
A little, you know, bring them up and just puddle up a little bit and just,

2420
03:26:49,850 --> 03:26:52,729
you know, like what dad does at the wedding when he leans in and just,

2421
03:26:52,729 --> 03:26:54,329
I just wanted to tell him a couple things.

2422
03:26:54,329 --> 03:26:55,049
Appreciate that.

2423
03:26:58,700 --> 03:27:00,540
All right, so we have, let's go stop it.

2424
03:27:15,899 --> 03:27:17,260
What are you talking about?

2425
03:27:17,260 --> 03:27:23,129
I just had a moment with somebody.

2426
03:27:23,129 --> 03:27:30,780
Come on, cross over here so I can stop you.

2427
03:27:45,190 --> 03:27:46,979
Got it.

2428
03:27:46,979 --> 03:27:47,479
Doink.

2429
03:27:58,010 --> 03:27:59,209
Don't suck up Abe Lincoln's head.

2430
03:28:02,389 --> 03:28:02,889
No!

2431
03:28:03,430 --> 03:28:07,290
Oh, not Abe Lincoln.

2432
03:28:07,290 --> 03:28:07,790
No!

2433
03:28:17,700 --> 03:28:18,899
Casualties.

2434
03:28:18,899 --> 03:28:21,219
What do you think's on the other side, Sam?

2435
03:28:21,219 --> 03:28:22,260
Oh, I don't know.

2436
03:28:22,260 --> 03:28:25,620
Probably some horrible alternate dimension ruled by incomprehensibly

2437
03:28:25,620 --> 03:28:28,659
horrific ancient gods seeking to bring chaos to this plane.

2438
03:28:28,659 --> 03:28:29,940
Do you want to jump in?

2439
03:28:29,940 --> 03:28:31,139
You can read my mind, Sam.

2440
03:28:31,139 --> 03:28:32,420
Oh, we're going a new dimension.

2441
03:28:32,420 --> 03:28:33,059
I hope not.

2442
03:28:34,579 --> 03:28:42,409
It's my opportunity.

2443
03:28:42,409 --> 03:28:42,889
I can do it.

2444
03:28:57,399 --> 03:29:20,489
They're more difficult than I imagined a horrific alternate dimension to be.

2445
03:29:20,489 --> 03:29:20,889
Help.

2446
03:29:21,530 --> 03:29:22,489
Help me.

2447
03:29:23,530 --> 03:29:24,549
Help!

2448
03:29:24,549 --> 03:29:26,309
Oh, you big baby.

2449
03:29:26,950 --> 03:29:30,790
But my nose sunburns so easily.

2450
03:29:30,790 --> 03:29:31,909
I'll get it for you later.

2451
03:29:32,950 --> 03:29:35,030
Oh, hi, StamaMax.

2452
03:29:35,030 --> 03:29:36,709
Are you guys on vacation too?

2453
03:29:36,709 --> 03:29:37,670
Yeah, we're on vacation.

2454
03:29:37,750 --> 03:29:41,809
We came here to rescue you from unimaginable horrors beyond the portal of mystery

2455
03:29:41,809 --> 03:29:46,549
You could have at least had the courtesy to be impaled on spikes or something step aside

2456
03:29:48,510 --> 03:29:54,530
Well, thanks for the thought guys, but this place is great. What was the name of it again? Hey

2457
03:29:55,629 --> 03:29:59,629
What scab are you guys eating in that pot activity in the South Pacific?

2458
03:30:00,309 --> 03:30:04,270
Commonly known as Easter Island because once you leave three days later

2459
03:30:04,270 --> 03:30:09,629
You can't wait to come back Abe and I thought this would be a great chance to get some alone time

2460
03:30:10,430 --> 03:30:12,430
emphasis on alone

2461
03:30:13,590 --> 03:30:18,069
Finally someone has come to rescue us from the ancient prophecy

2462
03:30:19,590 --> 03:30:23,930
Talk oh Sam ancient prophecies can only mean two things

2463
03:30:24,709 --> 03:30:30,469
Tedious backstories and work we don't get paid for let's hear them out little buddy. Well, all right

2464
03:30:30,670 --> 03:30:37,229
Maybe these giant stone heads have something interesting stone heads. What's all this about a prophecy?

2465
03:30:37,229 --> 03:30:42,790
The ancient ones said this was going to happen. It's the end of our civilization

2466
03:30:43,590 --> 03:30:48,149
But you can stop the prophecy and save us all

2467
03:30:49,829 --> 03:30:50,989
Okay

2468
03:30:50,989 --> 03:30:55,430
What what is the prophecy? What exactly does this prophecy say is going to happen?

2469
03:30:55,590 --> 03:31:01,170
The carvers were told of golden age of one thousand years of peace

2470
03:31:05,389 --> 03:31:09,030
Cataclysm the great volcano god Rana how would

2471
03:31:09,510 --> 03:31:16,870
Reawaken and rain fiery death upon the island our noble civilization would come to an end

2472
03:31:18,950 --> 03:31:21,049
Sounds like we picked the coolest time to come

2473
03:31:21,530 --> 03:31:26,350
What do you want us to do you must stop Ron a cow from the

2474
03:31:30,379 --> 03:31:37,040
Legend speak of a hidden cave beneath the island where the ancient carvers built a means to pacify

2475
03:31:37,260 --> 03:31:43,180
Dribble Venus eyes in the mood for a little spelunking and volcano god pacifying a little buddy

2476
03:31:43,260 --> 03:31:50,399
If by pacifying you mean squeezing the magma out of him like toothpaste from a savagely beaten tube and by spelunking you mean

2477
03:31:50,920 --> 03:31:52,920
Spelunking and yes

2478
03:31:53,680 --> 03:32:00,340
Okay, we'll do it. We'll take the case your honor. What does that mean like the Hawaiian word aloha?

2479
03:32:00,340 --> 03:32:05,780
It can mean many things like hello. Goodbye or as in this case

2480
03:32:06,180 --> 03:32:08,620
We're not going to pay you

2481
03:32:09,659 --> 03:32:11,659
Really is the universal language

2482
03:32:12,299 --> 03:32:14,299
Not even a couple of bits

2483
03:32:15,139 --> 03:32:20,100
Anything else in that prophecy who are you guys? Who are you guys? Anyway, we are the moai

2484
03:32:21,059 --> 03:32:25,559
Guardians of the island spirit keepers of the elemental power

2485
03:32:26,420 --> 03:32:30,260
Sounds like either a good prog rock album or a bad animated series. I

2486
03:32:31,260 --> 03:32:33,260
control the power of wind

2487
03:32:35,299 --> 03:32:40,420
Well, I used to control the wind now there's not much point to it

2488
03:32:41,899 --> 03:32:43,680
Okay

2489
03:32:43,680 --> 03:32:49,700
So where's the cave? Where is this ancient hidden underground cave? It's hidden. Cool it rocky

2490
03:32:49,700 --> 03:32:51,700
We were asking the middle one

2491
03:32:52,139 --> 03:32:57,819
Unfortunately, he is correct. The entrance to the cave is shrouded in mystery. It's gonna be in one of their mouths

2492
03:32:58,819 --> 03:33:00,579
with peril

2493
03:33:00,579 --> 03:33:07,059
Brought with peril or just right with peril. This is the kind of thing we need to know going in it doesn't matter

2494
03:33:07,059 --> 03:33:09,059
You'll never find it

2495
03:33:09,219 --> 03:33:13,670
Okay, cheer up max and I will find a way to stop that volcano

2496
03:33:13,670 --> 03:33:20,590
Oh good, then we'll be able to go back to our important work of sitting motionless and staring

2497
03:33:21,670 --> 03:33:27,110
We have something to look forward to that's a really really good Queen of thorns

2498
03:33:29,270 --> 03:33:33,600
Impression I feel like the Queen of thought feel like that was watching game from

2499
03:33:34,440 --> 03:33:44,040
portal triangle triangle

2500
03:33:44,079 --> 03:33:51,659
Gone and lost and found they don't even know that

2501
03:33:52,500 --> 03:33:55,700
That's not a joke. I just think that that sounds just like all this junk

2502
03:33:56,020 --> 03:34:01,260
I'm gonna ring the triangle anything good want to read the second half of the 20 commandments

2503
03:34:01,260 --> 03:34:05,020
Nah, I only support omnipotent deities when I'm the deity

2504
03:34:05,899 --> 03:34:15,229
Okay

2505
03:34:15,229 --> 03:34:17,030
fountain of youth

2506
03:34:17,030 --> 03:34:21,329
Gong light preserver the only thing that survived from the SS minnow

2507
03:34:21,530 --> 03:34:25,750
Did they ever find all those irritating castaways? Nobody ever looked

2508
03:34:26,649 --> 03:34:31,959
It's the fountain of youth

2509
03:34:35,299 --> 03:34:38,850
All right, so there was a deadly piranha swimming in it

2510
03:34:39,610 --> 03:34:41,610
I never wished that about anything

2511
03:34:42,569 --> 03:34:48,090
Get rid of the piranhas somehow triangle pong. What are these?

2512
03:34:48,930 --> 03:34:56,739
Check this out max. It's even the same color scheme this portal

2513
03:34:57,299 --> 03:35:06,770
When did this come out? It's a gong with a silver triangle on it. Check this out max

2514
03:35:07,489 --> 03:35:09,489
All right, so

2515
03:35:09,530 --> 03:35:22,780
This is the portal out anything else in here. There's the picnic. They're doing a picnic over here

2516
03:35:23,420 --> 03:35:33,030
Gong there's like this gongs all over the place. It's a silver gong. Oh, we're salmon max freelance bro. The cake is a lie

2517
03:35:33,030 --> 03:35:37,379
I can do this one

2518
03:35:40,940 --> 03:35:47,040
Still can't understand you speak a little more clearly

2519
03:35:47,559 --> 03:36:01,600
What's left of Noah's Ark? So the legends are true

2520
03:36:01,879 --> 03:36:07,840
Someone really was crazy enough to save mosquitoes from extinction and humans live and learn

2521
03:36:08,840 --> 03:36:16,530
I know where to go. How did you find picnic stuff on a desolate island? Easy. It was on the picnic basket

2522
03:36:17,290 --> 03:36:25,049
So I drank all the coffee out of this coffee mug. It's been sitting here empty with just a little coffee stain on the bottom

2523
03:36:28,000 --> 03:36:31,520
That it's this smells so bad, I don't know why

2524
03:36:32,440 --> 03:36:36,200
When coffee dries out, that's why I never spill coffee in your fucking car

2525
03:36:36,920 --> 03:36:42,069
When coffee dries it smells it like shit

2526
03:36:42,670 --> 03:36:44,549
like actual shit

2527
03:36:44,549 --> 03:36:49,409
I've ever one time my mother dumped a whole coffee in the car accidentally

2528
03:36:50,170 --> 03:36:53,049
And it smelled like my little ass

2529
03:36:53,889 --> 03:37:00,530
Five years, but something tells me this just might be the ancient entrance to the secret underground lair of the volcano god

2530
03:37:00,530 --> 03:37:02,530
Where do you think you're going?

2531
03:37:07,930 --> 03:37:12,809
Try not to get imprinted or shot max we still don't know who this little type belongs to

2532
03:37:13,049 --> 03:37:15,049
Jimmy Hoffa belongs to nobody

2533
03:37:18,409 --> 03:37:20,579
Okay, so

2534
03:37:20,579 --> 03:37:26,989
You can't be Jimmy Hoffa Jimmy Hoffa was a ruthless union organizer and head of the teamsters in the 50s and 60s

2535
03:37:27,469 --> 03:37:32,389
Known for his ties to organized crime and his mysterious disappearance good recap Sam

2536
03:37:32,750 --> 03:37:37,190
Also, Jimmy Hoffa wasn't a diaper wearing baby. I'm not a baby

2537
03:37:37,190 --> 03:37:39,190
No

2538
03:37:42,870 --> 03:37:50,149
People always showing me disrespect you should never have started drinking from that fountain of youth. No, it makes sense

2539
03:37:51,149 --> 03:37:56,020
What fountain of youth are you talking about? We're gonna be babies fountain right there brainiac

2540
03:37:57,139 --> 03:38:00,860
You expect us to believe the fountain of youth is on Easter Island

2541
03:38:00,860 --> 03:38:04,180
I can't believe it. I can't believe how perfect he is

2542
03:38:05,819 --> 03:38:13,500
Okay, you came here for the mountain water a little hard haven't you I do but take on occasion. Yes. That's my business

2543
03:38:22,659 --> 03:38:28,659
Well, why'd you drink so much of infancy look I ain't got no problem, so don't go saying that I do

2544
03:38:29,139 --> 03:38:31,940
It's just a little discretion is required

2545
03:38:32,459 --> 03:38:38,059
Drink too little you have to go through puberty again too much and bada bing

2546
03:38:39,459 --> 03:38:40,940
but as

2547
03:38:40,940 --> 03:38:45,920
Just take a small sip every day and stay the same age, you know

2548
03:38:45,920 --> 03:38:52,280
Well, just take put an eye droplet in there and like drop one droplet into your eye and you'll stay like 40 forever

2549
03:38:52,280 --> 03:38:58,940
I don't see where the big deal is

2550
03:38:59,299 --> 03:39:04,139
Step aside sport we grown-ups have to take care of a great big mean old volcano gone

2551
03:39:04,299 --> 03:39:08,440
You and your companion will be one thing to take a step back

2552
03:39:14,219 --> 03:39:20,459
Not now max then when Sam my biological clock is ticking and I'm not getting any younger

2553
03:39:21,139 --> 03:39:27,430
If you spit into the fountain, do you get older?

2554
03:39:27,989 --> 03:39:36,180
Know your spit would the whatever the DNA that's in the saliva would would transmute whatever it does

2555
03:39:36,700 --> 03:39:39,770
No, it would have to come in contact with you

2556
03:39:40,409 --> 03:39:43,670
Okay, so we need to obviously

2557
03:39:44,510 --> 03:39:51,030
His baby getting fussy. Is it his bedtime? I'm gonna speak. Yeah, that's it gets younger

2558
03:39:55,030 --> 03:40:04,250
How can we find out it's baby gassy this baby need to be birthed that's weird to hear that

2559
03:40:05,530 --> 03:40:07,530
It's baby gassy

2560
03:40:07,850 --> 03:40:11,899
That's the first time we've heard. I think him change the way that he speaks

2561
03:40:12,579 --> 03:40:14,489
This is very weird

2562
03:40:14,489 --> 03:40:22,350
We'll give you a nice big rattle for that dumb old gun of yours. You two are seriously trying my patients

2563
03:40:27,549 --> 03:40:32,930
We're going bye-bye now, bye-bye you'll stay gone if you know what's good for you

2564
03:40:36,670 --> 03:40:38,670
To get him to get out of the way

2565
03:40:39,350 --> 03:40:45,819
We can't go in bye. Bye. So we need to okay. Tiny Tiki is this way

2566
03:40:46,860 --> 03:40:55,680
Looks like we've stumbled into some primitive Tiki bar. How it's going

2567
03:40:58,520 --> 03:41:03,659
Pipe down chucklehead. No, I was hoping to get into a lagomorphs gone wild video

2568
03:41:03,879 --> 03:41:06,239
Howdy boys haven't seen you around before

2569
03:41:06,879 --> 03:41:11,840
Sam they're all babies stay calm max. They're more frightened of you than you are of them

2570
03:41:13,239 --> 03:41:16,020
All right, so this is called wipeout

2571
03:41:16,979 --> 03:41:20,579
Hey max, want to see how I won all those surfing trophies back in school

2572
03:41:20,579 --> 03:41:25,020
No, I don't want to see you cry to the PE teacher and then beg me to club your competitors in the knees

2573
03:41:25,020 --> 03:41:29,940
Why? Oh, you're just jealous of my more plausible center of gravity. Watch this

2574
03:41:31,299 --> 03:41:36,739
It's surfing time as the surfboard bucks back and forth use your mouse for the arrow keys to dodge flying bottles

2575
03:41:38,739 --> 03:41:40,739
He's like up or down

2576
03:41:40,819 --> 03:41:50,569
Two surfers don't lose pal. We just bide our time on the next way

2577
03:41:50,569 --> 03:41:56,649
I thought I'd press left all their arms and shriek like startled raccoons either. I'm pretty sure you lost

2578
03:41:58,170 --> 03:42:03,860
Try to have your socks knocked off little pal. I don't wear socks and socks feet humor me socks

2579
03:42:03,860 --> 03:42:06,020
You'll better pretending that you're not naked. Okay

2580
03:42:16,260 --> 03:42:24,260
Hold on. It's not it's not instant. The Sun was in my eyes. I'm gonna take another crack

2581
03:42:27,670 --> 03:42:34,760
The call

2582
03:42:42,559 --> 03:42:44,159
Why is it doing that

2583
03:42:44,159 --> 03:42:54,489
So, what do I get a baby bottle? Well, that was entirely point baby bottle pop a baby bottle pop. I

2584
03:42:55,010 --> 03:42:58,270
Hope so. So it was pointless

2585
03:42:58,909 --> 03:43:08,739
Purely decorative. Hey fellas, what brings you to our little slice of paradise?

2586
03:43:09,260 --> 03:43:16,979
Salmon max freelance police man, and we're here to stop a volcano you babies are in danger. Shut up. We're not babies

2587
03:43:19,020 --> 03:43:22,260
He's right pleased to meet you boys babies

2588
03:43:25,219 --> 03:43:29,739
My name's Amelia a hot you've already met. Mr. Charles Lindbergh, Jr

2589
03:43:29,940 --> 03:43:34,459
Whatever and that other fella is one. Mr. Dan Cooper. Hey

2590
03:43:35,459 --> 03:43:37,459
Call me DB everybody does

2591
03:43:39,139 --> 03:43:46,389
You've been missing forever. You guys have been missing for decades. That's the funny thing about this island

2592
03:43:46,389 --> 03:43:50,389
It's easy to lose track of time. They just keep drinking baby

2593
03:43:50,389 --> 03:43:56,389
You don't write you had conspiracy theorists and documentary filmmakers. Baby fountain youth drink. You can't tell us what to do

2594
03:43:56,389 --> 03:43:58,389
They keep drinking from the fountain of youth

2595
03:43:58,389 --> 03:44:00,389
You look younger than in your pictures

2596
03:44:00,389 --> 03:44:05,829
It's that damn fountain

2597
03:44:05,829 --> 03:44:07,829
Once you start drinking from it, you can't stop

2598
03:44:07,829 --> 03:44:09,829
We had to put the fountain off limits

2599
03:44:10,069 --> 03:44:15,430
From it, you can't stop we had to put the fountain off limits or we would have drunk ourselves out of existence

2600
03:44:16,430 --> 03:44:22,790
Ironic ain't it? I made my reputation being a woman. I'm afraid to wear pants and now I'm wearing rubber pants

2601
03:44:23,829 --> 03:44:30,700
It must have been a big adjustment going back to wearing diapers

2602
03:44:30,700 --> 03:44:33,180
Well, not for me when you're in my line of work

2603
03:44:33,180 --> 03:44:36,020
It helps to have some extra protection if you know what I'm saying

2604
03:44:36,180 --> 03:44:41,180
I ever tell y'all about how I dive them feds and jumped out of a jumbo only like a million times

2605
03:44:41,540 --> 03:44:46,100
Okay, what's the do around here you guys do come on around here

2606
03:44:46,100 --> 03:44:50,360
We used to ride the bucking surfboard until we drank ourselves under the hot limit

2607
03:44:53,500 --> 03:44:56,420
Give me a few more years and I'll beat your record Amelia

2608
03:44:57,540 --> 03:45:04,459
Why don't you just leave why haven't you gone home and ruin a clean getaway? No, they don't understand me at home

2609
03:45:04,459 --> 03:45:07,260
My parents are so stupid

2610
03:45:07,379 --> 03:45:12,159
And I'm not leaving until I get some service

2611
03:45:13,059 --> 03:45:15,059
Who is this one? Who's this guy?

2612
03:45:15,420 --> 03:45:27,229
How'd you manage to all regress to exactly the same age?

2613
03:45:27,250 --> 03:45:34,649
It was a very carefully planned and executed drinking game. You take a drink every time DB says the word parachute

2614
03:45:35,530 --> 03:45:37,590
Okay, see you around kids

2615
03:45:38,409 --> 03:45:42,989
We have to fill up with a drink. I'm gonna get a small max here

2616
03:45:43,649 --> 03:45:47,680
Well

2617
03:45:47,680 --> 03:45:53,639
It's an empty tea kettle tempest not included. Okay. Hold on a minute if we boil the water from

2618
03:45:54,360 --> 03:46:00,079
the Fountain of youth then it maybe will be the fountain of aging. Maybe the boiling the water gets rid of the aging germs and

2619
03:46:00,879 --> 03:46:05,159
It's cartoon logic guys. It's possible. I'm gonna boil the water

2620
03:46:05,719 --> 03:46:11,950
It's a swing town inferno. It's gonna reverse them

2621
03:46:12,350 --> 03:46:20,420
Where did you find so many femurs my old thorn section say hello to Jack Don and

2622
03:46:20,940 --> 03:46:27,459
Rochester that's awesome animals. Tell me about these guys still can't hold the high notes

2623
03:46:28,459 --> 03:46:33,579
steel pins go

2624
03:46:34,479 --> 03:46:37,200
Alas Gene Krupa. I knew him

2625
03:46:37,959 --> 03:46:42,360
Thank you. Thank you

2626
03:46:42,719 --> 03:46:48,040
Hiya boys. You're new here, right?

2627
03:46:48,479 --> 03:46:55,440
Salmon max freelance volcano stoppers. Well gosh, I'm glad to meet you. I'm Glenn Miller

2628
03:46:56,360 --> 03:46:58,360
Maybe you boys can help me out

2629
03:47:00,530 --> 03:47:02,530
Everyone here is missing

2630
03:47:03,129 --> 03:47:07,530
You're a missing person. We thought you were dead. Yeah, I get that a lot

2631
03:47:07,530 --> 03:47:11,170
I was here 20 years before I believed I wasn't really dead

2632
03:47:12,049 --> 03:47:15,889
Hated to break it to you Glenn, but all that hot playing was getting annoying. I

2633
03:47:16,850 --> 03:47:19,030
Don't know who any of these people are I

2634
03:47:20,090 --> 03:47:24,010
Don't I know I I don't know what the references I mean, this is not like

2635
03:47:24,530 --> 03:47:29,209
Chris Rock Adam Sandler David Spade those people were up here. I would know who they were

2636
03:47:30,010 --> 03:47:40,950
What's Benny Goodman like in person Benny could do things with a clarinet that nobody else could

2637
03:47:41,389 --> 03:47:44,829
Thank God a one night after a show in New York

2638
03:47:45,549 --> 03:47:49,909
I'll just tell you it was the damnedest thing I ever saw and and leave it at that

2639
03:47:50,909 --> 03:47:56,690
I know who they are my god. I don't know who they are. I know who two of them are

2640
03:47:57,309 --> 03:48:06,700
But honestly, I got this could be dawn nuts. I don't know from the Andy Griffith show

2641
03:48:06,700 --> 03:48:16,930
I don't know who that is. Was count Basie really a vampire a golem actually

2642
03:48:16,930 --> 03:48:20,250
But we never held that against it. That was we simply time

2643
03:48:21,049 --> 03:48:28,850
How'd you end up here? I was on a mission for the Air Force and I flew here

2644
03:48:29,010 --> 03:48:33,090
You mean your plane was sucked through a portal into an alternate dimension and deposited here

2645
03:48:33,170 --> 03:48:36,610
No, just got kind of lost and crashed on Easter. I

2646
03:48:37,250 --> 03:48:44,290
You ever get a song stuck in your head and can't get it out. It's downright distracting

2647
03:48:45,250 --> 03:48:48,520
All right, so song

2648
03:48:49,120 --> 03:49:00,270
What do you need help with? I'm trying to find just that perfect sound for my next big hit

2649
03:49:00,629 --> 03:49:01,829
Oh

2650
03:49:01,829 --> 03:49:05,670
That's it

2651
03:49:05,670 --> 03:49:12,629
Well, gee, thanks, but I don't want to just put out a repeat of my early stuff. It's got to be new and fresh

2652
03:49:13,149 --> 03:49:15,510
But I'm stuck on on two things

2653
03:49:15,510 --> 03:49:20,790
I need a catchy melody and I need a good train sound a train sound

2654
03:49:21,870 --> 03:49:24,299
You need a melody and a train

2655
03:49:24,540 --> 03:49:28,739
You need a melody and a train whistle for your song cool

2656
03:49:28,819 --> 03:49:36,659
You but I'm pulling out all the stops this song's gonna be about all the things the kids are into these days

2657
03:49:37,340 --> 03:49:42,620
Train the song is gonna be perfect swing dancing in methamphetamines

2658
03:49:43,379 --> 03:49:45,260
But how are we gonna find a new melody?

2659
03:49:45,260 --> 03:49:49,860
You've been here 60 years and have been able to give my show you guys I'm teething

2660
03:49:50,299 --> 03:49:52,819
Baby, Lindbergh, baby is what I got so far

2661
03:49:53,219 --> 03:49:55,219
electronic music

2662
03:49:59,459 --> 03:50:20,229
Do you like it you think it'll be good with the kids keep on rockin plan word if I had a hammer

2663
03:50:20,229 --> 03:50:25,920
Oh, you can take that mallet if you want. I was going to use it for percussion

2664
03:50:29,639 --> 03:50:36,360
Any direction that doesn't involve hitting things with hammers is no direction. I want to go. Thank you and good day, sir

2665
03:50:46,370 --> 03:50:49,059
That's it

2666
03:50:50,020 --> 03:51:01,520
Okay, I got the I can hit the gongs so we need a train sound

2667
03:51:09,870 --> 03:51:15,790
What oh stop so what do these gongs do

2668
03:51:23,559 --> 03:51:25,559
Portal just showed I can't reach it

2669
03:51:28,430 --> 03:51:32,139
Okay

2670
03:51:33,219 --> 03:51:38,940
The ancients use them to transport the sacred stones and to travel all

2671
03:51:39,340 --> 03:51:43,739
Throughout the world and for practical jokes, which weren't funny

2672
03:51:44,860 --> 03:51:46,540
Okay

2673
03:51:46,540 --> 03:51:49,459
If you control the wind, let's see a demonstration

2674
03:51:50,459 --> 03:51:55,420
I'm not really in the mood not in the mood. Come on. Blow us up a typhoon

2675
03:51:55,420 --> 03:52:01,540
I guess I've just got a case of the Blas. I don't know

2676
03:52:01,940 --> 03:52:03,579
sacred stones

2677
03:52:03,579 --> 03:52:08,260
God is okay. So I'm gonna make you happy so you blow

2678
03:52:09,020 --> 03:52:17,639
All right, don't do it. Have you heard the good news about rhinoplasty? What are you in flying? Oh

2679
03:52:18,440 --> 03:52:25,440
Nothing. It's good. You're not bound by the conventions of traditional beauty. I'm just the way the Carver's made me

2680
03:52:26,520 --> 03:52:29,500
All right, keep up the good work

2681
03:52:31,299 --> 03:52:37,860
Make them happy, but so did this causes the triangles to appear can more than one appear

2682
03:52:38,659 --> 03:52:44,389
Or can just one appear does it is just one that shows up and teleports over this way

2683
03:52:45,110 --> 03:52:51,959
Okay, so that I guess I can read maybe do it on this one and I can reach into it

2684
03:52:52,639 --> 03:52:55,459
Maybe I could see what's in it

2685
03:52:57,040 --> 03:53:03,729
Check this out max. Where does it go?

2686
03:53:04,370 --> 03:53:07,319
All right, so oh

2687
03:53:12,370 --> 03:53:14,489
That's the book. Hey, that's this one kiss and now

2688
03:53:17,899 --> 03:53:22,979
For some reason I thought they would these were okay. So can I reach in and like grab his head?

2689
03:53:23,459 --> 03:53:29,250
See what happens goldfish memory

2690
03:53:30,700 --> 03:53:39,659
You know, I'm getting up. Let me tell you something. I'm getting real sick and tired of people questioning

2691
03:53:40,180 --> 03:53:51,610
Yeah, no, no, cut it cut the music cut the music. Let me tell you something

2692
03:54:02,840 --> 03:54:05,680
Like the back of the head. Wait, there's a gong over here

2693
03:54:06,280 --> 03:54:25,000
So I okay. Here's where this I don't understand. I can't reach in why why would this matter?

2694
03:54:33,469 --> 03:54:40,159
I'm assuming there's an item that I need to do all these things check this out max

2695
03:54:40,680 --> 03:54:45,229
Like yeah, all I can do is put my hand in there. But if I had something else I could

2696
03:54:45,770 --> 03:54:47,770
Transfer it around but what?

2697
03:54:48,129 --> 03:54:59,459
Well, I could go back to the real world. I think I have exhaust all the options here besides of the picnic

2698
03:54:59,459 --> 03:55:03,340
Let me go over here. Don't you think it's amazing that you found that picnic basket full of food?

2699
03:55:03,500 --> 03:55:07,180
Not really. It was sitting right there. You couldn't miss it

2700
03:55:08,100 --> 03:55:11,620
How's the vacation going? Oh

2701
03:55:11,620 --> 03:55:15,260
The weather's perfect and there's so much history and culture

2702
03:55:15,540 --> 03:55:22,420
The best part is that Abe and I finally get some time all to ourselves. Let's talk there. No distractions

2703
03:55:24,659 --> 03:55:28,020
Abe what? Oh, yeah, right culture

2704
03:55:29,100 --> 03:55:35,270
The volcano is gonna explode volcano is going to erupt in a deadly rain of fiery magma. Aren't you worried?

2705
03:55:35,270 --> 03:55:39,590
Are you sure you're a dog? Did you sound like a big chicken?

2706
03:55:40,149 --> 03:55:45,790
Be nice Abe. Well, if it looks like the volcano is going to blow we'll just hop back through the triangle

2707
03:55:49,780 --> 03:55:55,459
Just between the four of us those moai statues are real jerks now you just shut your mouth

2708
03:56:04,299 --> 03:56:09,719
Trouble in paradise have fun kids. Don't wait up

2709
03:56:10,319 --> 03:56:14,870
So long you two

2710
03:56:15,870 --> 03:56:20,709
Talk to you talk to you. What about you? This is the one that doesn't like me

2711
03:56:21,229 --> 03:56:26,430
Why the long face? It's just that we've been here for so long and there's so little for us to do

2712
03:56:26,430 --> 03:56:30,389
I have to question the soul-crushing bleakness of our existence and oh

2713
03:56:31,069 --> 03:56:37,389
Wait, you're making fun of me aren't you took him long enough to catch on and the way that sob story was going

2714
03:56:37,389 --> 03:56:42,190
I thought he was about to show us baby pictures and have his sign his yearbook. Not cool

2715
03:56:43,190 --> 03:56:44,709
All right

2716
03:56:44,709 --> 03:56:50,790
One here Joe. Hey, how many volcano gods does it take to screw in a light bulb hackneyed and blasphemous?

2717
03:56:51,389 --> 03:56:53,389
Sheesh up island

2718
03:56:53,989 --> 03:56:55,590
Okay, what do you?

2719
03:56:55,590 --> 03:57:00,670
How about this problem you believe in all this prophecy of destruction mumbo-jumbo? Of course I do

2720
03:57:00,670 --> 03:57:05,430
I can feel run a cow's anger rumbling. Even now me too, Sam

2721
03:57:05,430 --> 03:57:08,829
I think those tamales from stinky's are repeating on me. Ah

2722
03:57:08,989 --> 03:57:12,069
It's got a logical humor very classy

2723
03:57:13,510 --> 03:57:16,260
Don't worry

2724
03:57:16,260 --> 03:57:22,979
Your civilization is coming to a fiery cataclysm again. Don't sweat it. I'm glad you can joke about the end of our civilization

2725
03:57:22,979 --> 03:57:24,979
I don't find it particularly funny

2726
03:57:26,100 --> 03:57:28,069
Okay

2727
03:57:28,069 --> 03:57:32,069
What's your story if you must know I am the keeper of the power of earth

2728
03:57:33,389 --> 03:57:38,950
Why don't you give us a demonstration? I'm not going to unleash the tremendous power of the earth God on just a whim

2729
03:57:40,510 --> 03:57:45,270
Shake the earth. Okay, so shake with your volcano problem. At least you could do is shake things up and win

2730
03:57:45,270 --> 03:57:50,069
This isn't some game. I wasn't granted elemental powers just to amuse you

2731
03:57:50,270 --> 03:57:55,629
Are we gonna have to dig this guy up to get the stick out of his butt? He wasn't always like this

2732
03:57:56,309 --> 03:58:02,309
Double dig that guy out trees ago when the ground would shake with his laughter

2733
03:58:02,309 --> 03:58:07,469
And there was a time when you didn't need a sandblaster to fit in your ceremonial dress

2734
03:58:07,750 --> 03:58:09,750
That was uncalled for

2735
03:58:10,950 --> 03:58:14,559
Okay, got to make this one laugh this one happy

2736
03:58:15,440 --> 03:58:24,559
Hmm. What's the problem man? Stop being so uptight and give us a demonstration. I'm not in the mood get lost

2737
03:58:24,760 --> 03:58:26,760
All right. So how do we make you laugh?

2738
03:58:27,399 --> 03:58:30,920
Don't go anywhere. We'll be back. Is that supposed to be funny?

2739
03:58:32,159 --> 03:58:33,200
Hmm

2740
03:58:33,200 --> 03:58:35,559
so comedy

2741
03:58:35,559 --> 03:58:38,510
funny something

2742
03:58:38,510 --> 03:58:39,989
happy I

2743
03:58:39,989 --> 03:58:41,959
don't know about you though

2744
03:58:42,000 --> 03:58:48,639
All right, let's go back to earth and explore a little bit

2745
03:58:50,670 --> 03:58:53,909
Like I have an idea of what's going on here. Can I shoot the fish?

2746
03:58:54,510 --> 03:58:56,870
Sometimes the simplest answer is the easiest one

2747
03:58:57,510 --> 03:59:22,469
So what about the diner anything in here?

2748
03:59:22,469 --> 03:59:27,190
Oh, I can talk to the I remember that they said they wouldn't talk until the I stopped the time

2749
03:59:27,190 --> 03:59:29,989
Howdy cops anything new in the out-of-body business

2750
03:59:34,190 --> 03:59:36,190
Naturally

2751
03:59:38,590 --> 03:59:45,950
Oh, it's a captivating melody composed by a resident musical maestro

2752
03:59:48,709 --> 03:59:52,790
All right enough with the sales pitch how much it is not for sale

2753
04:00:03,870 --> 04:00:08,819
All right, there's a new tell us about the new game

2754
04:00:11,040 --> 04:00:13,040
That is correct

2755
04:00:20,079 --> 04:00:23,040
We are sorry, did we just blow your mind

2756
04:00:24,719 --> 04:00:30,159
I don't like to brag but my prowess at banjo legend extreme is pretty renowned throughout the tri-state area

2757
04:00:30,479 --> 04:00:37,040
And i've been banned from 27 local arcades for playing forbidden dance insurrection in ways the designers never intended

2758
04:00:37,840 --> 04:00:43,360
Does not compute you are saying that music video games already exist

2759
04:00:45,760 --> 04:00:49,239
We play the new game how do we play this game of yours

2760
04:00:57,000 --> 04:00:59,000
Well, here's the melody for the

2761
04:01:00,200 --> 04:01:04,040
You know the guy in there that I don't remember his name the right time earning more points the closer

2762
04:01:04,040 --> 04:01:06,040
We get to being in rhythm with the soundtrack

2763
04:01:07,799 --> 04:01:15,959
Obligated calculating that would require processing power far beyond error not a number

2764
04:01:16,600 --> 04:01:20,340
Just destroy all the to win our exclusive new car horn

2765
04:01:22,899 --> 04:01:35,250
Would you like to play our game let's do it so we have to run stuff over again

2766
04:01:35,889 --> 04:01:39,329
Hello and welcome to the pimp the car music challenge

2767
04:01:39,889 --> 04:01:44,690
Your goal is to drive over the bagpipes and own me the bagpipes don't hit the courty

2768
04:01:46,129 --> 04:01:52,850
Thanks to advance of the nanotechnology at the dark car you can now try using a computer keyboard in addition to your mouth

04:01:53,969 --> 04:01:55,969
Ready go

2770
04:01:59,030 --> 04:02:04,680
Where are the bagpipes you see any bagpipes I do I see them

2771
04:02:05,159 --> 04:02:17,489

04:02:40,719 --> 04:02:42,719
Okay, get them

2773
04:03:03,760 --> 04:03:08,120
What is that you see that thing rolling at the end

2774
04:03:15,510 --> 04:03:17,510
So is it a train

2775
04:03:19,829 --> 04:03:22,790
Be sure to come back soon and play again

2776
04:03:25,040 --> 04:03:27,920
Don't worry max. I'll put it back before we go cruising again

2777
04:03:28,959 --> 04:03:31,989
So what is the sound is like the melody right? How does it go?

2778
04:03:33,459 --> 04:03:36,899
I want to hear it. I just want to make max happy for a second

2779
04:03:40,639 --> 04:03:42,719
Just for I needed to do it just for one second. I know he's

2780
04:03:43,520 --> 04:03:45,250
It's okay

2781
04:03:45,250 --> 04:03:47,250
All right, so I have the musical maker

2782
04:03:48,280 --> 04:03:54,899
From these guys, let's go in the diner. Hi stinky. What? Oh

2783
04:04:04,930 --> 04:04:06,719
Nothing doing

2784
04:04:06,719 --> 04:04:08,719
Anything else I need in here?

2785
04:04:09,040 --> 04:04:11,200

2786
04:04:11,200 --> 04:04:16,959
Camp david granite. What is it camp david granite grinder little tykes grinder with

2787
04:04:18,000 --> 04:04:20,290

That's okay

2789
04:04:22,719 --> 04:04:29,120
Anything I can do palm tree. Wait, can I get a coconut or it doesn't need a gardener? It needs a plastic surgeon

2790
04:04:31,329 --> 04:04:33,649
Napoleon not pictured his right hand

2791
04:04:36,360 --> 04:04:43,159
Is one of those people on the island gene shallot kaplan? Whatever happened to him? He's been masquerading as gene shallot apparently

2792
04:04:43,879 --> 04:04:54,479
Why are you checking out bosco flint for a client samo said she was the poor chumps mom

2793
04:04:55,040 --> 04:05:00,959
She was a real no-nonsense dame with legs up to here hairy legs, but still

2794
04:05:03,440 --> 04:05:07,030
And then there's jesus

2795
04:05:07,030 --> 04:05:09,030
Okay, they have these little passwords under here

2796
04:05:14,440 --> 04:05:16,129
Airhorn

2797
04:05:16,129 --> 04:05:20,850
This your pipe stinky. Yes. I looted it from the corpse of a 50-foot sherlock holmes

2798
04:05:21,729 --> 04:05:25,120
Can we have it?

2799
04:05:25,120 --> 04:05:26,079
No

2800
04:05:26,079 --> 04:05:30,559
I come on. That's your pipe stinky. Yes. I know but what about these things?

2801
04:05:31,360 --> 04:05:38,239
Where's the band? I keep hiring drummers, but they keep combusting and not slowly over time either

2802
04:05:39,180 --> 04:05:40,879
spontaneously

2803
04:05:40,879 --> 04:05:44,549
I can't like take that for his music shop

2804
04:05:47,250 --> 04:05:50,129
All right. Well, I have I can bring the horn back. Let's try that

2805
04:06:03,989 --> 04:06:06,069
Maybe in boscos that I didn't do what about the office?

2806
04:06:14,239 --> 04:06:16,680
Hey moscow

2807
04:06:16,680 --> 04:06:18,680
What do you know about easter island?

2808
04:06:19,409 --> 04:06:23,889
Who told you to ask me that just some guy outside in a black suit and sunglasses

2809
04:06:24,370 --> 04:06:26,370
Seem to know a lot about you bosco

2810
04:06:26,370 --> 04:06:28,370
They're getting closer

2811
04:06:29,879 --> 04:06:32,120
Bosco has the water been tasting funny to you

2812
04:06:32,120 --> 04:06:37,079
Why am I doing this to him ever since we saw those government guys working on the pipes down the street

2813
04:06:37,479 --> 04:06:44,920
It tastes like control and makes me want to pay taxes good thing. I distill sanitize and recycle my own water

2814
04:06:47,110 --> 04:06:50,069
He he gets it about those black helicopters hovering outside

2815
04:06:50,629 --> 04:06:53,270
Stop trying to freak me out fools. I'm busy

2816
04:06:54,149 --> 04:07:00,819
Hey bosco. Did you know you're being watched? Do you guys even know me? Of course, I know that

2817
04:07:01,299 --> 04:07:03,940
No, we mean right now from inside stinkies

2818
04:07:04,420 --> 04:07:06,420
Y'all just trying to make me paranoid

2819
04:07:06,659 --> 04:07:12,739
You think I don't have a camera inside stinkies. I'd know if I was being watched. Where's the camera?

2820
04:07:13,139 --> 04:07:14,579
It's genius

2821
04:07:14,579 --> 04:07:19,059
Hidden inside the pie that nobody ever eats oops, by the way

2822
04:07:19,540 --> 04:07:24,659
Tell stinky her place would look a lot better if she didn't have that big black lump in the booth

2823
04:07:24,819 --> 04:07:26,819
That looks like a small intestine

2824
04:07:28,180 --> 04:07:34,290
Where you planning to go? Oh, you'd like me to tell you where my emergency bunker is

2825
04:07:34,850 --> 04:07:38,129
No chance you'll have to stop goofing off and bill jones

2826
04:07:38,530 --> 04:07:45,170
It's just like the fable of the grasshopper and the ant if the ant were a paranoid lunatic and the grasshoppers too come to think of it

2827
04:07:46,450 --> 04:07:52,530
All right. Where's the emergency bunker in it? But uh, where's your emergency bunker bosco for the last time?

2828
04:07:52,930 --> 04:07:56,450
My secret bunker's secret location is a secret

2829
04:07:58,440 --> 04:08:02,200
Do you have any honey bunches of pumice brand cereal? Yes

2830
04:08:02,600 --> 04:08:07,399
It's good and it's good for you and it's all for the bunker. We're gonna find the bunker

2831
04:08:07,479 --> 04:08:13,719
Do you have any stem packs and radiation cams fall out? Sure do cool. It wouldn't be a good emergency bunker without them

2832
04:08:14,979 --> 04:08:16,979
Unfortunately, they had to pay

2833
04:08:17,000 --> 04:08:19,000
I think the settlement was

2834
04:08:19,079 --> 04:08:21,319
Four to five million dollars out of court

2835
04:08:22,440 --> 04:08:24,440
Bethesda did not like that at all

2836
04:08:24,760 --> 04:08:30,440
That's kind of sad. Do you have any zombie repellent? Get out of here. There's no such thing as zombies

2837
04:08:30,920 --> 04:08:33,000
That's just what they want you to think

2838
04:08:37,799 --> 04:08:42,760
Do you have any powdered drink mix cases of it in every flavor you can think of?

2839
04:08:43,239 --> 04:08:48,920
Three day old rigatoni stuffed with marshmallow peeps in an orange soda reduction with a hint of cilantro

2840
04:08:49,399 --> 04:08:51,959
Every flavor a normal person can think of

2841
04:08:53,159 --> 04:08:57,719
Is that it? Do you have any high glass repair kits?

2842
04:08:58,120 --> 04:09:03,319
Not much worse than being stuck in the apocalypse with all the time in the world to read and then have your glasses break

2843
04:09:03,719 --> 04:09:08,360
Y'all think i'm an amateur this bunker is going to be 100 irony proof

2844
04:09:10,790 --> 04:09:16,950
Do you have any look for the last time? It's all for the bunker. Give it a rest already

2845
04:09:21,270 --> 04:09:23,590
All right. See you bosco. That's not for long

2846
04:09:29,319 --> 04:09:35,879
It's a combination microwave and x-ray machine perfect. Now we can see what's living inside the burrito and then watch it die

2847
04:09:36,840 --> 04:09:38,840
I don't think there's anything left I can do in here

2848
04:09:39,079 --> 04:09:42,690
I do know about an emergency bunker, which is probably the bathroom

2849
04:09:43,700 --> 04:09:45,700
And it's definitely the bathroom

2850
04:09:45,780 --> 04:10:00,500
Do the grandpa voice

2851
04:10:00,659 --> 04:10:02,370
for what

2852
04:10:02,370 --> 04:10:04,129
Just right now

2853
04:10:04,129 --> 04:10:09,000
Just because nothing else down here

2854
04:10:13,670 --> 04:10:18,530
Let me go into the office

2855
04:10:20,530 --> 04:10:22,850
Wait, wait, wait, was there anything else over here I could do?

2856
04:10:23,649 --> 04:10:30,340
Chew chew teeth miss me already chumps. Well, I ain't coming back no matter how much you beg

2857
04:10:30,819 --> 04:10:37,540
The place just isn't the same without your persistent funk and wheezy starting. Yeah. Well, i'm done with that rat hole

2858
04:10:37,540 --> 04:10:39,540
Happy birthday mega agro

2859
04:10:40,500 --> 04:10:46,739
We're gonna do it up. I have a wonderful birthday party and all your friends come and they have all kinds of toys for you

2860
04:10:47,059 --> 04:10:51,940
Because that's all that fucking matters in your birthday party is if somebody brings you something to eat and brings you toys

2861
04:10:52,500 --> 04:10:54,500
That's all that I that's all I get

2862
04:10:55,139 --> 04:10:57,299
Happy birthday. There you go. That's free birthday. No

2863
04:11:20,000 --> 04:11:26,290
God there's nothing we can do to torture me elmer that hasn't been done to him already torture. Yeah, we were pretty thorough last night

2864
04:11:27,729 --> 04:11:31,959
What oh god

2865
04:11:33,920 --> 04:11:36,159
Check the closet always check the closet

2866
04:11:36,879 --> 04:11:38,760
There they are

2867
04:11:38,760 --> 04:11:40,760
finest in remote control fisticuffs

2868
04:11:41,879 --> 04:11:50,180
Leonard looks surprisingly healthy for someone who's been in the closet for six months

2869
04:11:50,500 --> 04:11:56,180
I've been feeding him. Oh you old softy. I've been feeding some way to get rid of all those spiders

2870
04:11:57,700 --> 04:12:02,450
This is a fucked up inhumane shit going on in the closet here

2871
04:12:09,200 --> 04:12:12,399
Just like max this desk is full of handy secret compartments

2872
04:12:13,360 --> 04:12:16,799
Okay desk line. I don't think I think I just gotta keep going

2873
04:12:17,520 --> 04:12:31,219
I think we just have to go back

2874
04:12:32,159 --> 04:12:34,159
And do the music thing. That's all I have

2875
04:12:39,459 --> 04:12:42,020
Let's go see if I can blow the horn in his head

2876
04:12:42,659 --> 04:12:59,540
Let's try this

2877
04:12:59,540 --> 04:13:01,540
So we've got the horn

2878
04:13:03,590 --> 04:13:05,590
Hey glen listen to this action

2879
04:13:08,930 --> 04:13:15,649
That that's fantastic you like it who wrote it bring him with you so I can work with him full time

2880
04:13:16,049 --> 04:13:18,209
I don't think he'd like it here. No outlets

2881
04:13:18,850 --> 04:13:27,409
Well, in any case, that's the perfect melody for my new hit now. Just find me a good train sound and we're all set

2882
04:13:28,610 --> 04:13:31,809
me sound

2883
04:13:31,809 --> 04:13:37,239
Why is there a train?

2884
04:13:37,319 --> 04:13:39,959
Is there a a whistle or something I can find?

2885
04:13:40,680 --> 04:13:44,370
What this glass?

2886
04:13:44,370 --> 04:13:46,370
Well, okay

2887
04:13:46,690 --> 04:13:49,329
diaper rash dispenser the diaper rash

2888
04:13:49,950 --> 04:13:54,450
Ingredients bourbon wava juice mint and talcum powder. Whoa

2889
04:13:55,569 --> 04:13:57,430
the pacifier

2890
04:13:57,430 --> 04:14:05,510
Ingredients kerosene pepper spray dihydro capsaicin and wasabi. No, okay, which one sounds the best water ingredients

2891
04:14:06,129 --> 04:14:11,510
Artificial colors flavors preservatives and water. I mean, that's just a gatorade. I would drink this one

2892
04:14:12,549 --> 04:14:18,879
All right. Well, I have the cup now. Can I

2893
04:14:19,760 --> 04:14:34,079
Put this in the fountain youth the piranhas are in there though. What's left of Noah's ark?

2894
04:14:34,799 --> 04:14:41,409
Can I have some of that?

2895
04:14:41,409 --> 04:14:43,409
Maybe something with the portal. Can I like put the

2896
04:14:45,649 --> 04:14:47,649
Cup in the portal or

2897
04:14:47,969 --> 04:14:51,489
They're gonna jump out at me

2898
04:14:51,889 --> 04:14:53,889
Did I get it? Is this fast enough?

2899
04:14:54,530 --> 04:14:57,809
No, I gotta stop them

2900
04:14:57,809 --> 04:15:02,040
Let me just see what happens if I do this

2901
04:15:02,280 --> 04:15:04,770
I'm just curious if I can put things inside

2902
04:15:06,319 --> 04:15:11,520
No, siree

2903
04:15:11,520 --> 04:15:17,159
So how do I take care of this?

2904
04:15:17,159 --> 04:15:22,610
Nope

2905
04:15:22,610 --> 04:15:25,889
Can I actually use the cup on anything that can I fill the cup?

2906
04:15:26,920 --> 04:15:38,559
Hold on. Can I drink one of these or put one in?

2907
04:15:39,680 --> 04:15:44,719
The diaper rash ingredients bourbon guava juice mint and talcum powder

2908
04:15:44,719 --> 04:15:48,399
The only thing that you can't really the talcum powder is the only thing that's not good there. Like can I use it?

2909
04:15:49,600 --> 04:15:51,600
Oh, actually I can I can fill it up

2910
04:16:01,190 --> 04:16:08,229
They've already got their drink

2911
04:16:08,229 --> 04:16:16,040
Viper rat hold on. Let's see other one the passive fire kerosene pepper spray wasabi

2912
04:16:16,360 --> 04:16:19,479
Pepper spray the hydro capsaicin and wasabi

2913
04:16:20,520 --> 04:16:29,299
Not happening. No siree. No just just dump it

2914
04:16:30,100 --> 04:16:32,100
No, don't get more

2915
04:16:35,750 --> 04:16:42,309
Get the one that hurts

2916
04:16:42,309 --> 04:16:47,350
So is there somebody I can feed this to but I don't think that would work. We just dump it in the piranha pool

2917
04:16:48,389 --> 04:16:51,649
I feel like that's too easy. Does somebody

2918
04:16:55,489 --> 04:16:57,319
try

2919
04:16:57,319 --> 04:17:00,180
you

2920
04:17:00,180 --> 04:17:01,860
Want a drink mr. Hoffa?

2921
04:17:01,860 --> 04:17:07,059
Jimmy hoffa cannot accept a drink from none. Do you want it in your sippy car?

2922
04:17:07,219 --> 04:17:12,659
I didn't mean to do that. I want it served by a dues paying member of the waitresses union

2923
04:17:12,979 --> 04:17:20,260
How do we get into the waitresses union? Fortunately for you, I am the union leader and also dues collector

2924
04:17:20,979 --> 04:17:23,299
Yeah. Yeah, I know a setup when I see one

2925
04:17:23,700 --> 04:17:29,780
I suppose you want a favor to let us in the union the game has too many jimmies from spilling on the paying customers

2926
04:17:30,180 --> 04:17:35,620
Take a tray of drinks and ride the bucking surfboard without dropping anything

2927
04:17:36,180 --> 04:17:39,430
What?

2928
04:17:39,430 --> 04:17:43,250
Oh god

2929
04:17:43,250 --> 04:17:45,250
Now I have to ride the surfboard

2930
04:17:45,329 --> 04:17:50,479
Let me just see if I can I just dump this poison in here

2931
04:17:54,690 --> 04:17:56,690
No, no, dump the poison in there

2932
04:17:57,520 --> 04:17:58,959
Poison the fish

2933
04:17:58,959 --> 04:18:01,780
I guess I can't we gotta just keep this going

2934
04:18:09,040 --> 04:18:11,040
Hold this don't drop anything

2935
04:18:11,120 --> 04:18:17,239
All right. Here we go waitress tray wipe out

2936
04:18:18,600 --> 04:18:21,239
Max check this out. I'm gonna fuck this up for like an hour straight

2937
04:18:25,090 --> 04:18:27,090
Oh, yeah, i'm gonna screw this up for like a fucking full hour

2938
04:18:29,120 --> 04:18:31,120
I'll see you guys when I never compete

2939
04:18:31,520 --> 04:18:36,239
The sun was in my eyes

2940
04:18:37,200 --> 04:18:46,229
The sun was in my eyes

2941
04:18:55,030 --> 04:19:07,219
Straight up straight up. Oh, yeah

2942
04:19:08,500 --> 04:19:11,860
How much time has it been the hearse castle now do it with me on your head

2943
04:19:12,340 --> 04:19:16,020
Not unless one of the babies let you borrow his diaper. You're too easily startled

2944
04:19:17,059 --> 04:19:19,219
Third time's charm so I did it

2945
04:19:20,420 --> 04:19:22,340
Now, excuse me, sir

2946
04:19:22,340 --> 04:19:27,700
Wait, hold on can

2947
04:19:27,700 --> 04:19:32,020
German never loses I did what you wanted me to do. So let's talk

2948
04:19:36,639 --> 04:19:39,360
How about that harper didn't drop a single bottle

2949
04:19:40,139 --> 04:19:47,920
Impressive. I must admit. All right. All right, you're in you're lucky. I'm very thirsty now. Get me a drink

2950
04:19:49,719 --> 04:19:53,940
How about this one?

2951
04:19:57,030 --> 04:20:02,549
Thank you our little man's going to need you like that try it and i'll shoot off both your paws

2952
04:20:03,030 --> 04:20:05,430
How do you like that didn't even flinch?

2953
04:20:13,860 --> 04:20:18,280
um, okay

2954
04:20:18,280 --> 04:20:20,899
well

2955
04:20:20,899 --> 04:20:22,020
Can I?

2956
04:20:22,020 --> 04:20:24,020
Wait a minute. Can I?

2957
04:20:26,129 --> 04:20:29,510
Kerosene can I burn it? Can I can I give him like a fire drink?

2958
04:20:32,209 --> 04:20:41,620
That's what this is for

2959
04:20:42,180 --> 04:20:46,209
There's nothing in it

2960
04:20:46,209 --> 04:20:48,370
It's an empty tea kettle. Okay now put it

2961
04:20:51,399 --> 04:20:52,840
now put

2962
04:20:52,840 --> 04:20:55,879
What what what in there which one the same one diaper rash?

2963
04:21:03,639 --> 04:21:12,399
Or the same one?

2964
04:21:12,959 --> 04:21:19,040
Oh, it's the train with simulacrum of a train listen we constructed out of everyday household items

2965
04:21:19,520 --> 04:21:25,760
Don't say simulacrum. Well, that's perfect. That's just the sound I need for my big hit

2966
04:21:26,319 --> 04:21:29,520
Let's get started making musical history boys

2967
04:21:33,569 --> 04:21:37,809
Uh, there's a demo on that conch shell this is gonna be you

2968
04:21:38,530 --> 04:21:40,530
Are we going to get a producer credit?

2969
04:21:41,090 --> 04:21:43,090
Talk to my agent

2970
04:21:44,899 --> 04:21:46,979
So

2971
04:21:46,979 --> 04:21:48,739
Where do we do this?

2972
04:21:48,739 --> 04:21:51,909
Can we do it now do it here or what do we do with it?

2973
04:21:52,709 --> 04:21:54,069
Who needs this?

2974
04:21:54,069 --> 04:21:57,989
No, he's already

2975
04:21:57,989 --> 04:22:02,840
I need to get him a drink though. I'm sure they've already heard it

2976
04:22:03,559 --> 04:22:39,959
I know what that is

2977
04:22:59,430 --> 04:23:01,430
Put this through play it will make you happy

2978
04:23:13,040 --> 04:23:16,479
But yes, it's down like toe tapping

2979
04:23:22,319 --> 04:23:24,319
Oh, no whistling sound

2980
04:23:25,120 --> 04:23:26,000
Abe

2981
04:23:26,000 --> 04:23:28,000
Are you even listening to me?

2982
04:23:28,860 --> 04:23:36,260
Unfaithful, Abe

2983
04:23:36,260 --> 04:23:41,829
Okay. So wait a minute. Hold on

2984
04:23:41,829 --> 04:23:51,329
Do we put

2985
04:23:51,329 --> 04:23:57,969
Abe hold on so long you two

2986
04:23:59,780 --> 04:24:01,780
What's left of Noah's arm change a

2987
04:24:02,260 --> 04:24:04,020
I wonder if there's a way

2988
04:24:04,020 --> 04:24:11,750
not happening

2989
04:24:11,750 --> 04:24:16,069
Whistle so what is this is does she whistle into this? No, he needs to come up

2990
04:24:16,950 --> 04:24:23,510
I'm gonna put something what Abe wants to go over there

2991
04:24:25,190 --> 04:24:30,549
Come on blow us. You know how to whistle. Don't you just put your stone slabs together and blow

2992
04:24:31,430 --> 04:24:36,069
I think I need something else really in the mood. Well, you're not in the mood fine. Keep up. All right

2993
04:24:36,069 --> 04:24:38,069
So how do I get you to move now?

2994
04:24:39,829 --> 04:24:42,899
Will you move?

2995
04:24:42,899 --> 04:24:45,459
Playtime is over son. We've got important work to do

2996
04:24:45,700 --> 04:24:52,440
I'm expanding my enterprises back here and I'd hate for either of you to get hurt in the construction

2997
04:24:53,059 --> 04:24:55,620
I have to I definitely have to give him another drink of

2998
04:24:56,239 --> 04:24:58,819
freelancers family worse than scabs

2999
04:25:00,629 --> 04:25:03,829
He's gonna take a drink of the font newth he's gonna turn into an amoeba that's what's gonna happen

3000
04:25:04,389 --> 04:25:14,309
Going bye. Bye now. Bye. Bye. You'll stay gone if you know what's good for you

3001
04:25:14,790 --> 04:25:19,909
Sam look how his little eyes and the barrel of his gun follow us. I could squeal

3002
04:25:20,950 --> 04:25:40,399
Drink he tried this one. This one has actual alcohol in it

3003
04:25:42,469 --> 04:25:52,920
Drunk, baby. This is not this is illegal

3004
04:25:54,639 --> 04:26:00,079
Oh, Abe, isn't it beautiful that gentle breeze and that melody in the air?

3005
04:26:03,799 --> 04:26:06,040
Abe

3006
04:26:06,280 --> 04:26:09,879
That look you haven't heard one thing monkey ass, right?

3007
04:26:10,760 --> 04:26:14,520
What? Oh, I mean, did they talk? I hadn't noticed

3008
04:26:15,079 --> 04:26:17,079
So anyway for our next vacation

3009
04:26:17,159 --> 04:26:22,520
Hey windy sybil, I mean sybil have you ever thought about getting some surgery done?

3010
04:26:22,760 --> 04:26:28,760
What I was thinking if you had your nose stretched out, so maybe you sweared off the head a little you'd look fantastic

3011
04:26:29,559 --> 04:26:31,559
Not that you don't look nice now, of course

3012
04:26:31,879 --> 04:26:36,520
That is it. You've done nothing but stare at her this entire time

3013
04:26:37,000 --> 04:26:40,680
Come on. I'm a man. I'm not made of stone. Well, you know what I mean

3014
04:26:41,239 --> 04:26:44,840
Oh, I know what you mean. All right, you're just in a mood

3015
04:26:45,319 --> 04:26:46,920
No, i'm not

3016
04:26:46,920 --> 04:26:52,200
I will long remember what you said here and I will never forget what you did here

3017
04:26:52,600 --> 04:26:55,079
I just can't believe you'd insult me like this

3018
04:26:55,559 --> 04:26:58,120
And on my birthday happy birthday sybil

3019
04:26:59,239 --> 04:27:04,200
I said birthday today makes you have a good one to have a picnic and have some toys. That's what I want

3020
04:27:05,159 --> 04:27:14,930
That's it that free birthday

3021
04:27:15,889 --> 04:27:20,399
Well

3022
04:27:20,399 --> 04:27:23,360
And again, I forget to bring my video camera

3023
04:27:25,559 --> 04:27:26,440
Okay

3024
04:27:26,440 --> 04:27:30,760
Well that happened but we have an important task to do it's give alcohol to a baby

3025
04:27:46,520 --> 04:27:48,120
Say bye now

3026
04:27:48,120 --> 04:27:59,079
Let's try some water

3027
04:27:59,079 --> 04:28:01,639
Bourbon is not going to do it artificial preservatives is

3028
04:28:12,479 --> 04:28:13,840
I was thinking

3029
04:28:13,840 --> 04:28:15,280
give him the

3030
04:28:15,280 --> 04:28:28,680
fountain of youth

3031
04:28:28,680 --> 04:28:42,959
You just don't want water? Thank you. I've

3032
04:28:43,600 --> 04:28:45,760
It's probably the I've got to get the piranhas out of there

3033
04:28:49,489 --> 04:28:54,049
I don't think we've ever tried to stop a volcano before not unless you count that time in the philippines

3034
04:28:57,729 --> 04:29:00,049
Let's take in some sites or vice versa

3035
04:29:01,489 --> 04:29:05,010
It's definitely the fountain of youth and you feed it to him

3036
04:29:08,159 --> 04:29:09,120
but

3037
04:29:09,120 --> 04:29:15,520
We have another scenario over here things didn't go so well with sybil, huh? Yeah, she was cramping my style. Anyway

3038
04:29:16,079 --> 04:29:18,079
So miss moai

3039
04:29:18,079 --> 04:29:21,520
How you doing get bent beauty?

3040
04:29:21,920 --> 04:29:23,920
Fair enough

3041
04:29:24,000 --> 04:29:25,360
Okay

3042
04:29:25,360 --> 04:29:30,469
What's left of noah's art?

3043
04:29:30,629 --> 04:29:36,309
So, uh to put in a good word for you with sybil. Nah, i've still got a shot with the locals

3044
04:29:36,950 --> 04:29:45,270
Not even after another thousand years. Wow. I haven't seen rejection on that scale since I walked you in the last election

3045
04:29:46,469 --> 04:29:52,069
Don't you think it's amazing that you found that picnic basket full of food. I've got more important things

3046
04:29:52,229 --> 04:29:54,950
Should I go talk to sybil maybe I should go talk to sybil

3047
04:29:56,229 --> 04:29:58,229
What's back there what's left of noah's art?

3048
04:29:59,030 --> 04:30:01,329
They're gong back here

3049
04:30:01,409 --> 04:30:04,360
Looks like another gold gong

3050
04:30:08,069 --> 04:30:09,649
What?

3051
04:30:09,649 --> 04:30:11,969
There's no way I could reach that how do I get over there?

3052
04:30:12,850 --> 04:30:16,600
Now we have five community subs from splarg

3053
04:30:17,319 --> 04:30:18,760
Thank you splarg

3054
04:30:18,760 --> 04:30:20,930
For your five subs. Thank you

3055
04:30:24,200 --> 04:30:35,219
That has to mean something. I don't think I can reach that. I don't think I can shoot it from here

3056
04:30:35,860 --> 04:30:39,110
Are you serious? I don't need the gong

3057
04:30:40,069 --> 04:30:42,819
Well, what am I supposed to put over there?

3058
04:30:43,379 --> 04:31:00,979
Check this out max. What happens?

3059
04:31:01,059 --> 04:31:05,569
Is there anything over here?

3060
04:31:05,569 --> 04:31:07,569
I don't think this will uh

3061
04:31:08,370 --> 04:31:19,969
Nothing doing damn. All right. Well, that's probably for that's the volcano

3062
04:31:24,920 --> 04:31:27,159

Let's see. Okay. Here we go. Ready? Three two one

3093
04:35:04,400 --> 04:35:24,020
Put the plan into play

3094

All right. All right

3095
04:35:28,450 --> 04:35:31,360

I can't place exactly where

3119
04:37:36,479 --> 04:37:38,080

3120
04:37:38,080 --> 04:37:40,450

All right. Did he leave his gun?

3123
04:37:50,900 --> 04:37:57,619
I thought he's gonna turn into

3124
04:37:58,040 --> 04:38:02,919
Like a amiibo or cell or something. It would have been fun. I just shrunk him and popped him anybody home

3125
04:38:03,240 --> 04:38:06,060
We're here to fix your volcano god interloper

3126
04:38:07,479 --> 04:38:13,880
Dare violate our most sacred sanctuary. You're all in danger. The volcano is going to erupt

3127
04:38:14,439 --> 04:38:20,360
I don't like how their tentacles move. You treacherous defeat. You must answer to our leader

3128
04:38:22,599 --> 04:38:25,240
Oh my god, um who framed roger rabbit, right?

3129
04:38:26,279 --> 04:38:32,130
Is that what movie is it mighty kamehameha doing donuts in a square paddle boat kissing max?

3130
04:38:32,369 --> 04:38:36,610
It's the spectral form of mr. Spatula. That's just our dead goldfish

3131
04:38:36,930 --> 04:38:38,930
From

3132
04:38:43,009 --> 04:38:45,009
What be the punishment

3133
04:38:51,840 --> 04:38:56,020
High priest has spoken you to be executed

3134
04:39:00,159 --> 04:39:02,959
Now hang on what you have say for self

3135
04:39:04,659 --> 04:39:06,659
Um, you can't kill us we're famous

3136
04:39:07,220 --> 04:39:10,500
Be reasonable seahorse monkeys, but your spatula is evil

3137
04:39:11,060 --> 04:39:16,979
Your high priest is a false prophet that very serious claim to make

3138
04:39:17,459 --> 04:39:24,419
Could make us lose tax exempt status. How are you back it up with a filet knife and some sushi rice

3139
04:39:24,900 --> 04:39:29,000
kill them

3140
04:39:29,000 --> 04:39:31,479
Uh, you can't kill us. We're famous. You can't execute us

3141
04:39:31,639 --> 04:39:36,919
We're the freelance police killing us would bring down the wrath of legions of fans and licensors

3142
04:39:37,479 --> 04:39:39,479
Not to mention the aspca

3143
04:39:39,560 --> 04:39:42,520
We know like killing speak for self

3144
04:39:43,080 --> 04:39:45,720
But we must act on wheel of high priest

3145
04:39:46,279 --> 04:39:50,040
He our only can do it to mighty feet

3146
04:39:51,159 --> 04:39:58,290
Okay

3147
04:39:58,290 --> 04:40:02,209
Think about what you're doing. You seem like a fairly reasonable group of uh,

3148
04:40:02,930 --> 04:40:04,209
What are you anyway?

3149
04:40:04,209 --> 04:40:10,689
We are the underfoot protectors of the sacred home of ranakao the volcano god

3150
04:40:11,169 --> 04:40:14,049
The airbreathers call us ocean chimps

3151
04:40:14,689 --> 04:40:16,689
We know like that name

3152
04:40:18,639 --> 04:40:23,599
Okay enough of these we know that imposter is lying because max is the true high priest

3153
04:40:24,479 --> 04:40:28,319
He does have feet maybe shulu's dog speaks the truth

3154
04:40:29,040 --> 04:40:35,759
Look, we ancient civilization that worship giant feet who speak to us through ghost fish high priest

3155
04:40:36,080 --> 04:40:41,040
We're not gullible if white one with mouth truly is high priest

3156
04:40:41,599 --> 04:40:44,819
He prove it by fulfilling the ancient prophecies

3157
04:40:45,680 --> 04:40:52,400
I bet there are three of them. He knows our ancient traditions. Maybe he really is the chosen one

3158
04:40:52,799 --> 04:40:59,520
Ancient say that an outsider will be anointed by the feet the feet will recognize him

3159
04:41:00,000 --> 04:41:03,599
And he will perform great miracle to feed his people

3160
04:41:03,759 --> 04:41:07,200
He was feeding these water becomes delicious treats

3161
04:41:07,680 --> 04:41:13,279
And the island itself will show us the face of the true high priest

3162
04:41:13,840 --> 04:41:16,560
He appears before us in the living rock

3163
04:41:18,689 --> 04:41:20,290
Ah

3164
04:41:20,290 --> 04:41:27,810
How does max get anointed by the whole anointed by the feet business the great feet speak to us through the high priest

3165
04:41:28,290 --> 04:41:33,810
The outsiders stand under the great feet. They move to show they accept him

3166
04:41:35,090 --> 04:41:38,840
Okay

3167
04:41:38,840 --> 04:41:42,119
What kind of miracle are you guys looking for prophecy say

3168
04:41:42,680 --> 04:41:49,560
The high priest feed us by turning water by turning water to banang so I mean water

3169
04:41:50,919 --> 04:41:58,299
Banang eat delicious banana flavor drink that fortified with essential vitamins and minerals

3170
04:42:01,159 --> 04:42:02,919
That's the fake water

3171
04:42:02,919 --> 04:42:06,849
with banana flavoring

3172
04:42:06,849 --> 04:42:13,250
What do you mean about the island showing his true face prophecy say image of true high priest

3173
04:42:13,569 --> 04:42:16,130
Will appear to us in the cavern

3174
04:42:16,770 --> 04:42:20,770
That prove our high priest is the one look

3175
04:42:25,319 --> 04:42:28,069
You mean that image of max?

3176
04:42:28,150 --> 04:42:29,189
what

3177
04:42:29,189 --> 04:42:36,229
You crazy that no look anything like box max have two ears. That's just a seashell

3178
04:42:36,950 --> 04:42:41,990
Rock next to it look exactly like high priest though. It's miracle

3179
04:42:42,790 --> 04:42:44,869
All right, so we have to put his ears down

3180
04:42:45,830 --> 04:42:47,830
All that is max in a nutshell

3181
04:42:48,229 --> 04:42:54,310
We believe it when we see it we fair people we give you until soon down

3182
04:42:54,709 --> 04:42:58,310
You prove white one is high priest and we know kill you

3183
04:43:00,099 --> 04:43:01,680
Okay

3184
04:43:01,680 --> 04:43:04,400
So we need to make max we're going to take max's head

3185
04:43:05,119 --> 04:43:07,119
We got to cut his ears off

3186
04:43:08,150 --> 04:43:10,549
or fold him down with blue or

3187
04:43:11,029 --> 04:43:13,380
I don't know

3188
04:43:13,380 --> 04:43:15,380
Oil or something. We'll just slick him back

3189
04:43:15,860 --> 04:43:22,580
And then we need to feed them a banana flavored water and then we have to go get worshipped by the feet

3190
04:43:24,479 --> 04:43:30,740
All right. We want to get max anointed up

3191
04:43:34,560 --> 04:43:36,560
Okay, we humor you

3192
04:43:37,659 --> 04:43:40,659
Almighty feet give us a sign

3193
04:43:41,680 --> 04:43:47,040
Do you recognize this white stranger as your servant whose feet are these though?

3194
04:44:00,470 --> 04:44:03,990
Give it a minute. The feet just don't recognize me without the mustache

3195
04:44:04,310 --> 04:44:06,310
You waste our time

3196
04:44:07,349 --> 04:44:13,990
Say you not high priest we killed him now. No, we must wait for sundown

3197
04:44:14,869 --> 04:44:16,150
So, okay

3198
04:44:16,150 --> 04:44:19,029
This all right

3199
04:44:19,110 --> 04:44:20,069

3200
04:44:20,069 --> 04:44:22,069
Okay, so what all right?

It's the desperate for the most relaxing trip on easter island bring plenty of basalt

3285
04:52:46,080 --> 04:52:50,880
It's a mind-altering substance for the moai that helps them tune in turn on and drop out

3286
04:52:52,000 --> 04:52:53,599
Can I shoot that?

3287
04:52:53,599 --> 04:52:59,200
And turn it on don't work underwater guns. Don't work underwater. Is it one next to his hairiously hanging stalactite?

3288
04:53:00,080 --> 04:53:04,750
Let me go just look at it for a second

3289
04:53:05,630 --> 04:53:10,880
Here's this one. The water cooler is one of the most often repeated forms appearing in nature

3290
04:53:11,360 --> 04:53:18,439
So the something right next to his head

3291
04:53:19,720 --> 04:53:23,759
He has one right next to him, right?

3292
04:53:23,759 --> 04:53:27,529
It's this one

3293
04:53:27,529 --> 04:53:43,979
Go back down because it's one two three, right?

3294
04:53:44,700 --> 04:53:47,900
Maybe not that way. Wait, what do you mean wrong?

3295
04:53:48,380 --> 04:53:55,840
It's the middle one. Isn't it isn't it right next to the third feet right here?

3296
04:53:56,639 --> 04:54:04,540
What do you mean? No

3297
04:54:04,540 --> 04:54:05,580
No

3298
04:54:05,580 --> 04:54:10,360
What?

3299
04:54:10,360 --> 04:54:12,799
It's the middle one

3300
04:54:12,799 --> 04:54:21,069
No, i'm trying to activate the stalagmite next to him

3301
04:54:21,630 --> 04:54:34,560
Because there's three

3302
04:54:35,360 --> 04:54:38,400
I mean, I know I can do the the singing thing now

3303
04:54:41,340 --> 04:54:44,459
I thought this was gonna open and I could I was gonna go this way first

3304
04:54:46,479 --> 04:54:48,779
The music doesn't do anything to the third one

3305
04:54:48,779 --> 04:54:52,779
Now that this this is a portal right and this is the one next to him if I activate that I can like reach

3306
04:54:52,779 --> 04:55:02,729
In right?

3307
04:55:02,729 --> 04:55:14,189
All right, so max get up there. Let's get max anointed again

3308
04:55:15,849 --> 04:55:18,279
Does it look like a portal?

3309
04:55:19,159 --> 04:55:22,200
Mighty feet give us a sign

3310
04:55:23,080 --> 04:55:26,599
Do you recognize this white stranger as your servant?

3311
04:55:27,479 --> 04:55:35,799
I thought it would look like a portal. It could be like a portal

3312
04:55:41,849 --> 04:55:44,759

3313
04:55:44,759 --> 04:55:50,759

But you still not satisfy all three prophecies

3316
04:56:04,000 --> 04:56:08,979
Who's very explicit on this show us two more and we're convinced

3317
04:56:11,779 --> 04:56:18,099
Because he oh that looks very familiar it doesn't that that precariously hanging stalactite looks awfully familiar

3318
04:56:19,700 --> 04:56:21,700
Just let me humor myself for a second

3319
04:56:41,680 --> 04:56:43,840
Can I shoot it down? I can't think I shoot it down

3320
04:56:46,540 --> 04:56:50,139
He's gonna like them. Okay, he's gonna laugh and this is gonna drop

3321
04:56:50,700 --> 04:56:57,520
Just need to make him laugh

3322
04:57:02,060 --> 04:57:05,580
And then I stick that on the other all right, I don't know I i'm over thinking it

3323
04:57:05,580 --> 04:57:08,220
I thought I had to like turn that into a portal left of noah's art

3324
04:57:09,810 --> 04:57:11,250

My opera was surfing legend. Miki dora taught me everything. I know

3375

Really, what can you tell us about easter island? It's kind of boring. Actually

3376
05:01:27,330 --> 05:01:30,049
There used to be a tiki bar near the fountain. That was pretty good

3377
05:01:30,689 --> 05:01:32,689

Roast beef monster cheese on a slab of granite on sliced sourdough. Nothing special

3381
05:01:45,409 --> 05:01:51,090
Slap a granite slab of granite. Yeah, you know for texture on the kids menu. I substitute a slab of a salt

3382
05:01:51,330 --> 05:01:53,330

3383
05:01:56,880 --> 05:01:58,880

3398
05:03:23,520 --> 05:03:25,520
He went into his bunker because we called him

3399
05:03:26,080 --> 05:03:28,380
That would be a good way to lose a hand

3400
05:03:33,250 --> 05:03:44,060
Scared him into the bunker

3401
05:03:44,060 --> 05:04:01,889
Because we need to come pre-jerk it's gotta be he's gone now there's got something I can fucking do in here freezer

3402
05:04:05,009 --> 05:04:07,889
Bosco tech cryogenic chamber and ice cube maker

3403
05:04:08,849 --> 05:04:10,610

Amazing. There's a perfectly preserved squirrel and a bunch of imperfectly preserved popsicles

3405
05:04:19,340 --> 05:04:26,060
Bosco seismograph steal the seismograph to measure earthquakes and giant robot attacks. Have we missed any giant robot attacks?

3406
05:04:26,540 --> 05:04:28,700
No, I think we actually caused all of them

3407
05:04:29,659 --> 05:04:34,139
The microscope radio is the radio we call them on noise seven one seven five there it is

3408
05:04:35,740 --> 05:04:38,060
Larger we thought enlargers would be smaller

3409
05:04:41,970 --> 05:04:48,529
Think bosco would mind if we helped ourselves to somebody good question another good question one can or two

3410
05:04:49,009 --> 05:04:53,619
One should be plenty

3411
05:04:53,700 --> 05:04:56,340
Founded

3412
05:04:56,340 --> 05:05:01,540
I'm looking around. I can't see look. Okay. I can't see that from back here. I can see like a can

3413
05:05:03,060 --> 05:05:06,659
It's like okay a little bit when I got close enough I could see it I was gonna look around

3414
05:05:08,500 --> 05:05:14,340
You can't read that from from back here. There's i'm looking at like the grand scheme here the grand space. Uh,

3415
05:05:16,270 --> 05:05:23,950
I moused over it. I wasn't reading it. I was mousing. How far away are you? I don't know 40 feet

3416
05:05:24,750 --> 05:05:29,650
30 feet maybe

3417
05:05:29,650 --> 05:05:31,409
Okay, so

05:06:04,110 --> 05:06:08,189
No, is it? I don't know about you sam, but i'm ready to chisel this guy a new one

3435
05:07:21,060 --> 05:07:26,500

05:07:26,500 --> 05:07:31,490

3437
05:07:32,700 --> 05:07:35,630
They're underwater

3438
05:07:35,630 --> 05:07:39,630
Uh, it what do you mean? This isn't spongebob. This is a goddamn cartoon

3439
05:07:40,669 --> 05:07:44,189
You want me to use cartoon logic? We're in a cartoon right now

3440
05:07:45,259 --> 05:07:53,380
It is spongebob

3441
05:07:53,380 --> 05:07:58,900
I thought I had to like add like a sprinkle of banana flavoring watch as high priest max performs a great miracle

What was once without sustenance make enriched with calcium, which is something our bodies need anyway

3444
05:08:17,520 --> 05:08:19,520
Just get on with it max

3445
05:08:21,439 --> 05:08:26,500
See it's like a powder

3446
05:08:26,580 --> 05:08:32,419
Eat like a party in the boat. I thought I had to add it like a crystal light packet

3447
05:08:33,860 --> 05:08:36,560
Sorry

3448
05:08:36,560 --> 05:08:39,360
But you're still not high priest yet

3449
05:08:39,919 --> 05:08:42,659
Most satisfying final prophecy

3450
05:08:45,520 --> 05:08:47,520
Yeah, I know about the final goddamn

3451
05:08:51,409 --> 05:08:53,409
final prophecy is it's

3452
05:08:53,569 --> 05:08:57,069
Uh-huh again in the sandwich

3453
05:08:57,310 --> 05:09:00,349
It's the desperately lonely traveler's guide to easter island

3454
05:09:00,650 --> 05:09:05,790
1963 edition for the most relaxing trip on easter island bring plenty of basalt

3455
05:09:06,349 --> 05:09:11,549
It's a mind-altering substance for the moai that helps them tune in turn on and drop out. Yeah

3456
05:09:20,380 --> 05:09:23,060
fountain of beverage

3457
05:09:23,060 --> 05:09:25,060
Give me the fountain beverage. Give it to me

3458
05:09:25,700 --> 05:09:27,700
But he can relax

3459
05:09:27,779 --> 05:09:31,619
Your buddy relax

3460
05:09:37,950 --> 05:09:40,750
Two steps forward 15 steps back you

3461
05:09:41,470 --> 05:09:45,950
You are making me so angry right now, you know, hold on cut the music for a second. Let me tell you something

3462
05:09:46,959 --> 05:09:55,900
I now that's an odd feeling. Hey, what gives the fountain of youth water is gone

3463
05:09:56,060 --> 05:09:58,860
What have you been sneaking into my inventory again max?

3464
05:09:59,180 --> 05:10:01,580
Don't blame me if you're having trouble holding your water

3465
05:10:01,979 --> 05:10:06,880
Why is it going water evaporates if it gets too far away from the fountain. That's damn inconvenient

3466
05:10:15,439 --> 05:10:17,439
Really? I can't just uh

3467
05:10:17,520 --> 05:10:25,599
so

3468
05:10:25,599 --> 05:10:30,000
So I can't we I cannot drink it and sprint. No, it's not gonna work

3469
05:10:32,529 --> 05:10:35,090
I have to drink it outside. It's gonna it's gonna happen

3470
05:10:40,380 --> 05:10:45,659
Watch this

3471
05:10:45,659 --> 05:10:47,659
Try it stupid

3472
05:10:48,619 --> 05:10:50,880
Give me a break

3473
05:10:50,880 --> 05:10:52,959
Try it. This is stupid

3474
05:10:53,520 --> 05:10:55,520
Okay. All right. Let's try it

3475
05:10:55,840 --> 05:10:58,590
dumb dummy

3476
05:10:58,590 --> 05:11:00,189
Oh to use

3477
05:11:00,189 --> 05:11:19,939
I couldn't have known that was gonna happen. Thanks for trying it. Dummy

3478
05:11:20,500 --> 05:11:23,860
all right, so very obviously we have to be small and we have to get in there and

3479
05:11:25,979 --> 05:11:27,979
I need to somehow

3480
05:11:28,060 --> 05:11:29,500
gotta

3481
05:11:29,900 --> 05:11:33,580
Gotta um, I gotta do something in here. What do I have to do in here?

3482
05:11:34,459 --> 05:11:40,900
Are you stinky? What? Oh

3483
05:11:45,299 --> 05:11:51,790
I mean you've got a gong in here. You've got a gong in here. This is not here for no reason

3484
05:11:52,750 --> 05:11:55,069
Nothing happened. Why doesn't stinky's gong work?

3485
05:11:55,069 --> 05:12:01,389
Like the ones is this the germa told the truth about taking forever to over complicate every scenario and the simplest one's always the right answer

3486
05:12:17,090 --> 05:12:21,569
I don't think you can have an account name that long. What about the ashtray? Can I let's say eat them?

3487
05:12:21,970 --> 05:12:27,270
Stinky's has a no smoking unless you're flint policy sounds a lot like their policy on homicides

3488
05:12:37,310 --> 05:12:42,110
Stop, but what if I don't feel like stopping then our insurance rates go up again

3489
05:12:42,990 --> 05:12:47,069
Let's think of the facts. I've got the sandwich. I've got to make him laugh

3490
05:12:47,790 --> 05:12:49,790
I've got the basalt

3491
05:12:49,869 --> 05:12:57,069
I need to be young inside of here and get the kid's menu the kid's meal. How do I become small?

3492
05:12:58,029 --> 05:12:59,470
In here

3493
05:12:59,470 --> 05:13:05,549
I can't bring the water here. There's a gong. That's up here. It might just be there for a comedy purpose

3494
05:13:06,270 --> 05:13:15,939
If germa you okay, you sound irritated. No, i'm fine

3495
05:13:16,819 --> 05:13:24,299
Put the gong in the cup

3496
05:13:25,180 --> 05:13:34,689
Should I can I fill it with like other liquids? Can I bring any other liquid out?

3497
05:13:35,490 --> 05:13:56,860
Boil the gong

3498
05:13:56,860 --> 05:14:03,310
Drink and then rush to stinky. I already tried that

3499
05:14:04,029 --> 05:14:10,500
All right

3500
05:14:10,500 --> 05:14:11,380
um

3501
05:14:11,459 --> 05:14:21,299
The passive fire ingredients kerosene pepper spray the hydro capsaicin and wasabi

3502
05:14:22,340 --> 05:14:27,580
How do I make you small?

3503
05:14:27,900 --> 05:14:30,400
Can I can you eat something?

3504
05:14:31,810 --> 05:14:33,810
Can I like cover it? Uh

3505
05:14:56,509 --> 05:14:58,509
Max has got to be small

3506
05:14:58,750 --> 05:15:00,750
And what the hell is that for?

3507
05:15:00,909 --> 05:15:02,909
I still don't know what that's for

3508
05:15:03,069 --> 05:15:10,419
What is that for?

3509
05:15:10,419 --> 05:15:11,540
smoke

3510
05:15:11,540 --> 05:15:29,650
No, I know I can activate it by shooting it, but I don't know what I need to do with it something

3511
05:15:29,810 --> 05:15:38,319
I don't even know why I still have this

3512
05:15:42,900 --> 05:15:45,939
I'm i'm stuck. I'm kind of stuck. I am but

3513
05:15:46,819 --> 05:15:52,419
Let me just get this in here

3514
05:15:52,419 --> 05:16:12,979
The gong the gong in sybil's is like this. No, it's not. It's like

3515
05:16:16,700 --> 05:16:18,700
If this is stupid enough to work

3516
05:16:18,860 --> 05:16:21,040
I'll be surprised but hold on a minute

3517
05:16:38,720 --> 05:16:39,599
No

3518
05:16:39,599 --> 05:16:43,119
Come on. I can't like take some of that goo and throw it on the gong

3519
05:16:43,919 --> 05:16:45,919
The red like portal goo

3520
05:16:48,580 --> 05:16:52,580
Stupid magic water evaporates if it gets too far away from the fountain inconvenient

3521
05:16:53,299 --> 05:17:00,610
Shit, hold on. Are you stinky? What?

3522
05:17:01,090 --> 05:17:07,360
Oh, give me that

3523
05:17:07,360 --> 05:17:10,479
I can't like squeeze the mustard on it and turn it orange

3524
05:17:23,279 --> 05:17:28,799
Looks like somebody already had a slice that explains all those ambulances this morning and the screaming

3525
05:17:29,279 --> 05:17:31,840
I can't I gotta be able to squeeze mustard on that shit

3526
05:17:41,569 --> 05:17:43,569
Damn it. All right. Well, let me go

3527
05:17:44,130 --> 05:17:51,520
Uh-oh

3528
05:17:51,520 --> 05:18:01,340
Well, that was a long one. That was a very very long one

3529
05:18:01,979 --> 05:18:04,930
I hope are we still hopefully live still?

3530
05:18:07,779 --> 05:18:09,779
Well, this would make three days in a row

3531
05:18:10,340 --> 05:18:11,220
of

3532
05:18:11,220 --> 05:18:14,819
Bad fucked up internet. So it's time to it is time to make another phone call

3533
05:18:15,299 --> 05:18:20,290
But I cannot do that tomorrow. So we're gonna have to deal with it tomorrow, too

3534
05:18:22,139 --> 05:18:25,549
Sorry

3535
05:18:25,549 --> 05:18:28,189
We have ten thousand five hundred drop frames

3536
05:18:29,680 --> 05:18:34,159
Not bad enough to turn the stream off but annoying enough where it happens, right?

3537
05:18:39,919 --> 05:18:41,680
It's definitely manageable

3538
05:18:41,680 --> 05:18:45,279
But now it's not good enough. You're fixing it again cocks

3539
05:18:46,000 --> 05:19:01,299
Is there something in here that I didn't do?

3540
05:19:03,810 --> 05:19:06,529
Can I take something out of can I take the banana out?

3541
05:19:07,250 --> 05:19:09,729
I drink something ceremonial feeding her

3542
05:19:10,290 --> 05:19:23,380
Not happening. Damn it. What about this? I can't open this thing

3543
05:19:25,229 --> 05:19:29,869
It's the entrance to the lava machine only used by a high priest

3544
05:19:37,650 --> 05:19:41,330
Oh for the love of god

3545
05:19:41,330 --> 05:19:43,169
What the fuck?

3546
05:19:43,169 --> 05:19:45,409
There's enough this another portal in here

3547
05:19:46,939 --> 05:19:52,220
There's a whole side of the cave. I didn't see snail trail. It's that sea snails disgusting red residue

3548
05:19:52,939 --> 05:19:56,860
Well, that's red sea snail. I hope that's red ink and not

3549
05:19:57,419 --> 05:20:02,240
Something else the world beneath the sea is both wondrous and completely disgusting

3550
05:20:07,680 --> 05:20:11,810
Okay

3551
05:20:11,810 --> 05:20:13,810
That gong doesn't need to be painted

3552
05:20:13,970 --> 05:20:20,450
I've got to paint a gong. I've got to paint the gong but red it's it's orange. It's not red

3553
05:20:21,409 --> 05:20:29,979
Do I have to go paint that gong?

3554
05:20:33,619 --> 05:20:36,419
Yeah, but like this I have to paint the gong red

3555
05:20:45,709 --> 05:20:47,709
No, siree. Let's go see what it does

3556
05:21:00,240 --> 05:21:03,729
All right, let's go paint it

3557
05:21:03,729 --> 05:21:17,139
That one's not red

3558
05:21:17,139 --> 05:21:20,659
That one this one's red. That's red, right? This is red

3559
05:21:21,299 --> 05:21:22,900
That's red

3560
05:21:22,900 --> 05:21:26,419
Oh, it's red. That's the bits of huge and it's red. It's a big red

3561
05:21:28,419 --> 05:21:31,619
That's the biggest red thing we've seen. It's a huge and red

3562
05:21:32,259 --> 05:21:57,009
Hi, stinky. What? Oh is doing red improves digestion. Don't try to argue with feng shui stinky

3563
05:21:57,330 --> 05:22:01,169
It's science. We can now activate and deactivate red

3564
05:22:02,450 --> 05:22:03,970
activate red

3565
05:22:03,970 --> 05:22:07,490
Really expected that to work. Ah

3566
05:22:09,090 --> 05:22:14,849
It pulls the biggest reddest thing here. How was I gonna connect those two? That's I what what?

3567
05:22:15,810 --> 05:22:31,740
It's huge and red. I what

3568
05:22:32,299 --> 05:22:34,540
That was a tough one that was tricky

3569
05:22:35,970 --> 05:22:37,970
It's obvious. What? No, it's not

3570
05:22:40,400 --> 05:22:42,240
It's not that obvious

3571
05:22:42,240 --> 05:22:52,720
It's tricky

3572
05:22:52,720 --> 05:22:56,400
Colors. Yeah, but I didn't know this one was connected to a gong. How would I know that?

3573
05:22:58,610 --> 05:22:59,970
All right, let's do it

3574
05:22:59,970 --> 05:23:06,049
And I gotta go find like a snail with blood coming out of its ass or whatever it was

3575
05:23:06,930 --> 05:23:12,860
Give us the kid's special, please. Hello, miss stinky. What do you boys want? Do you have money to pay?

Aren't you gonna cut the crust off? I've um misplaced my knife

05:23:45,549 --> 05:23:52,990
You probably left it in the real stinky's body. It's an honest mistake. Oh, that's silly you little rascals

3584
05:23:54,349 --> 05:23:57,950

3589
05:24:41,069 --> 05:24:43,069

Hey, you guys want to order a pizza really loud laugh

3599
05:25:34,770 --> 05:25:39,569
Well, what if we're like all dreaming now and what we think is a dream is really reality

3600
05:25:39,970 --> 05:25:44,709
That would explain why i'm always showing up at places with no laughs two or three times just to make sure

3601
05:25:47,970 --> 05:25:49,970
Dude

3602
05:25:51,919 --> 05:25:53,919

tight

3607
05:26:13,009 --> 05:26:18,529
Stalagmites are the ones on the ground so like tights are from the ceiling and you can remember that because stalactite has to hold

3608
05:26:18,610 --> 05:26:20,610
That's to stay on the ceiling stalactite

3609
05:26:31,919 --> 05:26:35,250
It finally shook loose

3610
05:26:35,250 --> 05:26:37,869
Wow, it's like an eight again

3611
05:26:37,869 --> 05:26:44,340

Save the day

3622
05:27:34,770 --> 05:27:37,169
We've got to get up there and stop that volcano

3623
05:27:38,529 --> 05:27:39,650
So wait

3624
05:27:39,650 --> 05:27:44,470
We still get to kill them now. Yes. No now we deal with imposter

3625
05:27:45,729 --> 05:27:49,180
that's

3626
05:27:49,180 --> 05:27:50,669
sad

3627
05:27:50,669 --> 05:27:54,349
Funny so-called high priest. What have you to say for yourself?

3628
05:27:56,750 --> 05:27:58,990
I thought we were pals. He said

3629
05:28:01,310 --> 05:28:03,310
Then he spit derisively

3630
05:28:03,790 --> 05:28:07,279
Me

3631
05:28:07,279 --> 05:28:08,720
Now he say

3632
05:28:08,720 --> 05:28:10,720
Me welcome death

3633
05:28:10,720 --> 05:28:17,759
Better than suffer tyranny of imprisonment on stale beach flakes. I knew I should have taken him for more walks

3634
05:28:18,319 --> 05:28:20,319
I blame myself. I blame you

3635
05:28:22,639 --> 05:28:28,560

05:28:34,959 --> 05:28:41,680
We not primitive we have cell phones they say the betrayal you're too late to stop volcano

3638
05:28:42,139 --> 05:28:48,720
fascist oppressor sam and max get herbal tea and foot rubs once and for all that doesn't sound so bad

3639
05:28:49,119 --> 05:28:54,319
Is this thing going faster? Now? He's saying that not what I said at all

3640
05:28:54,959 --> 05:29:00,560
Me confused not herbal tea and foot rubs rain or fire and drowning magma

3641
05:29:00,959 --> 05:29:02,319
I always

3642
05:29:02,319 --> 05:29:05,279
Should have taken the express part now. He's taking a long time

3643
05:29:05,840 --> 05:29:08,639
Sam and max come to your doom

3644
05:29:09,439 --> 05:29:11,439
In my spectral form

3645
05:29:11,840 --> 05:29:13,840
Press the in case of emergency button

3646
05:29:25,869 --> 05:29:37,099
What uh now he say my medallion no

3647

Cannot be what world what world he's gonna be fine

3648
05:29:47,340 --> 05:29:59,700
The dude's underwater you're gonna be all right no time max you're too late to stop the volcano. What do we do?

3649
05:30:00,419 --> 05:30:02,959
What do we do?

3650
05:30:02,959 --> 05:30:08,560
We press this emergency button. It says in case of emergency press it sam press it

3651
05:30:08,880 --> 05:30:10,880
I suppose now is as good a time as any

3652
05:30:13,490 --> 05:30:16,930
Uh

3653
05:30:16,930 --> 05:30:23,619
That did nothing more we can do here max. Let's go up top and check out the situation what?

3654
05:30:25,139 --> 05:30:29,779
Turn off the volcano like this. It's too late. The volcano's already going to a rock. All right

3655
05:30:29,779 --> 05:30:32,580
Well, we just okay get it done. Let's go go go come on. Hurry

3656
05:30:33,459 --> 05:30:35,459
With some pep in your step

3657
05:30:35,619 --> 05:30:39,299
Hey, look, I had the parking brake on that whole time. Whoops

3658
05:30:42,299 --> 05:30:50,689
All right, what did that do up here we need to see what's going on outside

3659
05:30:59,869 --> 05:31:05,549
Bloody-nosed euclid doing the eucarist on a nitro-burning catamaran. That's the second biggest bermuda triangle

3660
05:31:05,630 --> 05:31:08,430
I've ever seen seems to be spinning out of control, too

3661
05:31:09,869 --> 05:31:11,869
Now this one's getting up

3662
05:31:12,509 --> 05:31:17,869
That one is it went inside the only way home. I fail to see how this is helpful in an emergency

3663
05:31:18,270 --> 05:31:21,330
This is it. The volcano is about to explode

3664
05:31:24,939 --> 05:31:26,939
Help us sam and max

3665
05:31:27,900 --> 05:31:30,049
I'll try

3666
05:31:30,049 --> 05:31:32,450
But hold on. I forgot to get the thing that fell

3667
05:31:41,619 --> 05:31:47,759
run this thing

3668
05:31:48,930 --> 05:31:52,130
High priest medallion. It's the official signet of the ocean chimp's high priest

3669
05:31:53,090 --> 05:31:58,029
Don't I get to wear it? We don't have a chain long enough to fit around your enormous head chump

3670
05:31:58,509 --> 05:32:00,509
Okay, anything else sock crown?

3671
05:32:10,849 --> 05:32:12,130
You look right

3672
05:32:12,130 --> 05:32:16,450
Any more snail trail? It's that sea snail's disgusting red residue

3673
05:32:17,169 --> 05:32:20,369
All right, so I got

3674
05:32:20,369 --> 05:32:22,619
coin

3675
05:32:22,700 --> 05:32:28,159
Conk well, I did that. So now let's see so I have

3676
05:32:28,880 --> 05:32:36,990
All right, hold on

3677
05:32:36,990 --> 05:32:39,150
Cup of the snail trail. I maybe let's see

3678
05:32:43,580 --> 05:32:53,819
This one's pink

3679
05:32:53,819 --> 05:32:57,340
So we got that's I can act definitely have to do something with the one in the back

3680
05:33:09,939 --> 05:33:11,939
What do I have to do with this?

3681
05:33:16,259 --> 05:33:18,259
May I make pink maybe?

3682
05:33:32,380 --> 05:33:34,459
Can I scoop it up? I mean I need to make pink

3683
05:33:43,380 --> 05:33:49,540
No way. Nah

3684
05:33:49,540 --> 05:33:51,540
I still have to use it. Okay

3685
05:33:52,349 --> 05:33:54,750
Well, I have a red coin

3686
05:33:57,069 --> 05:34:00,189
red and blue makes pink red and green

3687
05:34:03,119 --> 05:34:06,860
red and

3688
05:34:06,860 --> 05:34:08,860
Red makes red and white

3689
05:34:28,029 --> 05:34:32,110
Well, i'm just going by previous logic that we had to paint the gong a different color

3690
05:34:36,750 --> 05:34:38,750
Maybe I have to paint the gong a different color now

3691
05:34:46,270 --> 05:34:49,229
Now it's a fucking call back to the beginning of the game

3692
05:34:50,400 --> 05:34:57,069
Hold on

3693
05:34:57,069 --> 05:35:06,029
Watch this

3694
05:35:06,029 --> 05:35:25,250
He's gonna stop what did that not work?

3695
05:35:26,590 --> 05:35:31,470
Uh, I hope there's nobody on the other side of that triangle. I thought I had to do way more than that

3696
05:35:31,549 --> 05:35:33,549
You said it dude, bro

3697
05:35:33,549 --> 05:35:40,290
You've done it. You've broken the prophecy. You've saved our ancient civilization from destruction

3698
05:35:42,590 --> 05:35:48,909
So sweet thing now that's over with let's say you and I find somewhere private to get

3699
05:35:49,689 --> 05:35:54,750
Sedimentary so accomplishment is something we've been screaming for 10 minutes time apart your loss

3700
05:35:55,310 --> 05:36:00,830
Can I get a ride with you guys? You guys like think i'm just sitting with my face into the other monitor going

3701
05:36:00,909 --> 05:36:02,110
Just where's the answer?

3702
05:36:02,110 --> 05:36:06,189
Mr. Lincoln only one way to find out I have to like click on the screen

3703
05:36:06,270 --> 05:36:10,590
But and I have to look at the screen. No, no, I have to look over here the whole time. Yes. I got it

3704
05:36:10,909 --> 05:36:17,950
Thank god. I guess we just sit here for another few thousand years. That's what I do

3705
05:36:19,069 --> 05:36:21,069
That sucks

3706
05:36:21,069 --> 05:36:48,240
Where's the music?

3707
05:36:48,240 --> 05:36:58,270
Imagine talking over the ending I could hear it just fine. No, I didn't mute anything

3708
05:37:09,900 --> 05:37:11,900
Is this supposed to be playing music?

3709
05:37:11,900 --> 05:37:36,580
It's all right. Don't worry. I'll I'll show it again. Yeah, maybe we lost the uh, the window is

3711
05:37:56,349 --> 05:37:58,669
I took like, I don't know. What was that like an hour and 20 minutes?

3712
05:38:05,060 --> 05:38:24,799
Isn't the general time for these like an hour to two hours? All right, shut up. Sorry. I had to stop talking

3713
05:38:35,659 --> 05:38:59,599
Here we go, you guys want to see the ending no see you guys in five minutes

3714
05:38:59,840 --> 05:39:14,130
I hope there's nobody on the other side of that triangle. I don't care. Uh

3715
05:39:14,849 --> 05:39:19,409
You said it dude, bro. You've done it. You've broken the prophecy

3716
05:39:19,569 --> 05:39:23,590
You've saved our ancient civilization from destruction

3717
05:39:25,970 --> 05:39:32,290
So sweet thing now that's over with let's say you and I find somewhere private to get

3718
05:39:33,069 --> 05:39:34,770
Sedimentary. Yeah

05:39:34,849 --> 05:39:41,810
I think we should spend some time apart your loss. Can I get a ride with you guys? Our portal back home is gone

3720
05:39:41,970 --> 05:39:43,970
We're gonna have to swim

05:39:44,860 --> 05:39:49,819
Do you float mr? Lincoln only one way to find out I get to ride on his do-lap

3722
05:39:50,060 --> 05:39:52,060
You can only call that once we get in the water

3723
05:39:55,259 --> 05:40:00,139
I guess we just sit here for another few thousand years

3724
05:40:02,659 --> 05:40:04,659
That sucks

3725
05:40:05,759 --> 05:40:07,279
Okay, so

3726
05:40:07,279 --> 05:40:12,000
Everyone was so upset that I spoke over the last four sentences of the game. Let's see what we have to do it again

3727
05:40:27,470 --> 05:40:34,430
Again with the music it's to say you i'll put it on youtube here now

3728
05:40:34,509 --> 05:40:58,880
I gotta do it again because the music's not there. Can I get it?

3729
05:40:59,439 --> 05:41:08,849
No, this is that's this is this is the rick and morty's ending credits. All right, that's it

3730
05:41:10,209 --> 05:41:13,970
That is it for tonight sam and max episode two season two

3731
05:41:24,000 --> 05:41:30,130
I will be back tomorrow tomorrow. We're gonna do something different

3732
05:41:30,610 --> 05:41:45,119
Probably should put this up right when you play

3733
05:41:45,840 --> 05:41:56,819
Blood fresh what's blood fresh supply. Am I gonna finish season two? Oh, yeah, definitely

3734
05:41:57,630 --> 05:42:08,959
Just not tomorrow tomorrow. We're gonna do something different remaster. Oh, okay

3735
05:42:09,439 --> 05:42:19,229
This is now a sam and max only stream. I think it's great

3736
05:42:23,380 --> 05:42:25,380
But tomorrow we're gonna do ms dos games

3737
05:42:25,779 --> 05:42:28,909
We're gonna do

3738
05:42:28,909 --> 05:42:30,250
uh

3739
05:42:30,250 --> 05:42:42,529
archive.org

3740
05:42:42,529 --> 05:42:45,169
Is sim earth in there? I don't know. There's like

3741
05:42:45,549 --> 05:42:47,330
4500 games

3742
05:42:47,330 --> 05:42:57,220
There's a lot to be honest. That sounds like shit. Well, you don't have to go

3743
05:42:57,779 --> 05:43:03,090
You don't have to watch tomorrow. You know, there's a thing in the top right corner of your screen

3744
05:43:04,049 --> 05:43:08,720
You can just click it

3745
05:43:08,720 --> 05:43:10,720
It's not that hard

3746
05:43:13,680 --> 05:43:15,680
But i'm gonna pee i'll be right back

3747
05:43:18,880 --> 05:43:29,630
And we will do the credits the good old credits after I piss so technically we'll be right back

3748
05:43:34,000 --> 05:44:04,849
See you very soon

3749
05:45:23,259 --> 05:46:24,419
Hello, why was this closed did my stream labs update it's odd

3750
05:46:28,369 --> 05:46:36,430
This feels incomplete

3751
05:46:36,509 --> 05:47:09,819
Maybe it's not which what chat is pissed. Why why is chat mad at me?

3752
05:47:10,220 --> 05:47:14,659
Why what do you mean chats mad? But why why why but what?

3753
05:47:16,540 --> 05:47:27,020
What did I do? What happened?

3754
05:47:27,020 --> 05:47:29,099
You know

3755
05:47:29,099 --> 05:47:41,619
What what what are you talking about? What are we mad about tonight lads?

3756
05:47:42,099 --> 05:47:54,419
It's not funny when you're mean to chat with mean to the person that mean to the one person that told me that they said

3757
05:47:54,500 --> 05:47:56,500
My stream was gonna be shit tomorrow

3758
05:47:57,680 --> 05:47:59,119
What?

3759
05:47:59,119 --> 05:48:01,150
That's one guy

3760
05:48:01,150 --> 05:48:03,630
Who was rude so I was rude back

3761
05:48:04,590 --> 05:48:09,060
What?

3762
05:48:09,060 --> 05:48:13,580
What are you talking about?

3763
05:48:13,580 --> 05:48:15,740
This is this is copypasta bullshit

3764
05:48:24,369 --> 05:48:28,340
What would jesus do he'd say hey cut it out asshole

3765
05:48:29,979 --> 05:48:45,470
That's what he would say. I don't think jesus would know english. He might

3766
05:48:45,950 --> 05:48:57,340
They're copypasting but when I said it I meant it

3767
05:48:58,669 --> 05:49:00,049
What?

3768
05:49:00,049 --> 05:49:03,119
That what are you talking about?

3769
05:49:03,119 --> 05:49:05,119
No, this is this is just bullshit

3770
05:49:11,090 --> 05:49:14,049
That one guy has a now permanent bias

3771
05:49:14,689 --> 05:49:23,200
Yeah, i'm i'm permanently getting t

3772
05:49:32,990 --> 05:49:34,990
One guy has so much power

3773
05:49:36,610 --> 05:49:40,529
When I look over here and I say here's what for the fourth stream in a row this week

3774
05:49:41,810 --> 05:49:44,369
Hey, I had this idea of playing like ms dos games

3775
05:49:45,090 --> 05:49:47,490
Now that's gonna suck that stream sucks

3776
05:49:48,349 --> 05:49:53,709
Like what like what what do you want me to do be like, yes, of course it will suck. You've got a great great idea

3777
05:49:53,790 --> 05:49:56,099
Good. Thank you

3778
05:49:56,099 --> 05:49:58,619
what

3779
05:49:58,619 --> 05:50:17,619
What do you what?

3780
05:50:17,619 --> 05:50:20,659
Don't acknowledge the one guy. I mean i'm i'm partially

3781
05:50:21,380 --> 05:50:25,040
Kidding when I acknowledge that

3782
05:50:25,040 --> 05:50:27,040
But I am gonna i'm gonna fight back

3783
05:50:27,040 --> 05:50:31,220
I'm a fighter

3784
05:50:31,220 --> 05:50:37,540
I lost in the first round when I got in that fight in high school

3785
05:50:39,229 --> 05:50:45,009
First round got KO'd I got the wrong thing up here

3786
05:50:45,569 --> 05:50:55,099
And then after that I took a vow to never ever fight anybody ever again

3787
05:51:03,520 --> 05:51:13,490
Back in 86

3788
05:51:13,490 --> 05:51:28,340
That was that was the smartest thing i've ever done. But anyways, yes, I will see you tomorrow

3789
05:51:43,380 --> 05:51:46,020
What games are we gonna play that's for up to you to decide

3790
05:51:49,119 --> 05:51:51,119
Because i'm gonna turn on smart clicks

3791
05:51:51,360 --> 05:52:01,419
So you'll be able to decide that I know there's a lot of things on there that I might not be able to stream

3792
05:52:03,979 --> 05:52:05,040
so

3793
05:52:05,040 --> 05:52:17,919
Gonna have to be careful with that one. You gotta get it right

3794
05:52:20,450 --> 05:52:24,610
But uh, let's go back to earlier. We are where are we here?

leader in game of thrones

3812
05:54:03,310 --> 05:54:05,500
uh

3813
05:54:05,500 --> 05:54:10,979
I feel like people say I look like a lot of people but I don't know about that one

3814

What do you got first today? Mr. Comcast?

3819
05:54:52,130 --> 05:54:54,689
Thanks with three dollars. Hey germa john comcast here. Just letting you know

3820
05:54:56,139 --> 05:54:58,040
that I saw you at

3821
05:54:58,040 --> 05:55:03,900
Nando's last night. I wanted to come say hi, but you were shouting profanities at the 16 year old busboy

3822
05:55:04,459 --> 05:55:06,619
Because kim only let you use the kids menu

3823
05:55:06,939 --> 05:55:12,860
I found it awkward when you dd teed the chef through table and then started harassing an elderly couple about how you kicked their ass

3824
05:55:12,860 --> 05:55:14,619
in the germa rumble

3825
05:55:14,619 --> 05:55:19,259
It got so bad that the police showed up but you escaped through the back door while carrying a box of cheeses

3826
05:55:20,060 --> 05:55:27,869
Why do I always have to like be?

3827
05:55:28,450 --> 05:55:32,290
This like insane person that's hurting people and breaking things

3828
05:55:35,860 --> 05:55:38,020
there's nowhere like a copy pasta here of like

3829
05:55:38,659 --> 05:55:40,659
I saw germa out at

3830
05:55:40,659 --> 05:55:44,099
Wendy's and he high-fived the guy in the window and gave him a

3831
05:55:44,560 --> 05:55:46,979
$100 tip and then turned around and winked at me

3832
05:55:51,569 --> 05:55:59,259
And in the back was a bunch of puppies that he was saving. It's never that it's always like I break shit and hurt people

3833
05:55:59,979 --> 05:56:05,310
Because they're telling the true stories. Yeah, there you go

3834
05:56:08,299 --> 05:56:12,509
That's unrealistic

3835
05:56:12,509 --> 05:56:30,459
You would do those things

3836
05:56:30,459 --> 05:56:31,659
Uh, thank you

3837
05:56:31,659 --> 05:56:32,779
I

3838
05:56:32,779 --> 05:56:34,159

3839
05:56:34,159 --> 05:56:36,080
I zek

3840
05:56:36,080 --> 05:56:38,080
I x e k isaac

3841
05:56:38,400 --> 05:56:41,439
Thanks for the five bucks bit late, but here's five dollars for the tendies bit

3842
05:56:42,080 --> 05:56:45,599
Got a good laugh out of me on an otherwise depressing birthday. Well, happy birthday. That's

3843
05:56:46,400 --> 05:56:53,819
Well, there's the coffee foster. There it is

3844
05:56:56,700 --> 05:56:58,700
But thank you the five dollars

3845
05:56:58,939 --> 05:56:59,819
I

3846
05:56:59,819 --> 05:57:02,430
We kind of were just talking about a random bunch of bullshit

3847
05:57:03,150 --> 05:57:05,150
Hope you thought it was funny glad you did

3848
05:57:07,779 --> 05:57:10,419
Hope you have a better. Uh, hope you have a better birthday

3849
05:57:11,060 --> 05:57:14,669
Sorry to hear that. It wasn't very good. Happy birthday though

3850
05:57:18,500 --> 05:57:20,659
Combine thanks for the three bucks. Here you are clown

3851
05:57:24,799 --> 05:57:26,799
Uh honk honk honk honk, right?

3852
05:57:28,509 --> 05:57:33,889
I didn't even do it right

3853
05:57:33,889 --> 05:57:36,849
But thank you. Thank you zack or zake again for the 250

3854
05:57:37,490 --> 05:57:41,650
Well, pretty cool that you have a black belt in karate. I didn't know that they use hockey pads in karate, too

3855
05:57:42,130 --> 05:57:45,169
PS have you ever thought about doing morning streams for eu boys?

3856
05:57:46,419 --> 05:57:48,099
Uh after yesterday

3857
05:57:48,099 --> 05:57:52,500
I thought this one might have been a little like an hour or two early, but no, I just wasn't able to do it

3858
05:57:53,700 --> 05:58:00,020
But not really planned on it. Unfortunately, I know there's a lot of people that want it but I have to be

3859
05:58:01,490 --> 05:58:05,729
Ready to stream and in a streaming mood and doesn't really happen that often in the morning

3860
05:58:07,970 --> 05:58:12,770
And for me to do an eu friendly stream, I have to start at at least you know, nine ten o'clock in the morning

3861
05:58:12,770 --> 05:58:13,970
It is not

3862
05:58:13,970 --> 05:58:15,810
That highly energetic

3863
05:58:15,810 --> 05:58:25,439
in the morning

3864
05:58:25,439 --> 05:58:29,279
But they will happen randomly from time to time like you see them already a couple times

3865
05:58:35,619 --> 05:58:41,060
Uh, thank you ranzor for the three bucks. No messages. Just three dollars. Thank you ranzor

3866
05:58:42,130 --> 05:58:46,529
Bimber ten. Thanks for the five dollars. Hey jeremy. I would eat my toes if you played no one lives forever, too

3867
05:58:47,520 --> 05:58:51,360
A spy in harm's way. It's a classic game that I think you would love it'd be entertaining to watch

3868
05:58:56,750 --> 05:58:58,700
um

3869
05:58:58,700 --> 05:59:04,060
I've never heard of it

3870
05:59:04,060 --> 05:59:08,900
But I admit maybe if I think it's something that's fun and worth streaming

3871
05:59:10,700 --> 05:59:17,779
I don't know. We had a lot of feet on stream today

3872
05:59:18,500 --> 05:59:22,930
Yeah, there was

3873
05:59:22,930 --> 05:59:26,930
German lied about taco bell. Thanks for the 250 mega mind for germa rumble

3874
05:59:32,560 --> 05:59:43,470
Good old mega mind

3875
05:59:43,470 --> 05:59:45,229
No mega minds

3876
05:59:45,229 --> 05:59:51,490
I'll get in trouble. Somebody will sue me. You never played it. It's

3877
05:59:52,209 --> 05:59:54,209
Look at the tricycle mine level

3878
05:59:57,919 --> 06:00:01,119
Bought 50 from bala koala earlier. Thank you so much bala koala

3879
06:00:03,090 --> 06:00:05,090
We touched upon it already, but that's a lot. Thank you

3880
06:00:05,889 --> 06:00:12,590
Ferotian weapon. Thanks for the 250 since the easter island heads aren't paying up. I will in their stead. Happy friday. Happy friday

3881
06:00:13,790 --> 06:00:29,090
Thank you. Thank you

3882

C4g

3883
06:00:31,060 --> 06:00:35,299

06:00:35,860 --> 06:00:43,020
What's on the collar? Is it a flower?

06:00:43,259 --> 06:00:56,110
That's a pretty great cat

3892
06:01:37,569 --> 06:01:44,099
But i'm yeah, i'm dead if we're gonna if we're gonna have a back and forth scenario here. I'm gonna fight back

06:02:10,110 --> 06:02:18,209
Chat rumble

3896
06:02:18,209 --> 06:02:20,639
You want to hear me flex?

That one that one was that one hit the ceiling

3901
06:02:44,540 --> 06:02:46,540
Most of the time you guys realize that

3902
06:02:47,340 --> 06:02:51,419
Whenever somebody if I say something where i'm like, oh fucking ray, what the fuck fuck you

3903
06:02:52,220 --> 06:02:54,779
i'm usually just fucking around

3904
06:02:55,099 --> 06:02:57,229
we have all kinds of

3905
06:02:57,229 --> 06:02:58,349
in

3906
06:02:58,349 --> 06:03:00,349
channel kind of back and forth

3907
06:03:01,729 --> 06:03:02,779
that

3908
06:03:02,779 --> 06:03:03,740

3909
06:03:03,740 --> 06:03:11,630

06:03:21,389 --> 06:03:23,389
I I can't like pretend

3912
06:03:24,270 --> 06:03:29,299
You hurt my feelings. What about my feelings?

3913
06:03:36,700 --> 06:03:38,700
You you took it too far

3914
06:03:39,180 --> 06:03:40,220
What?

3915
06:03:40,220 --> 06:03:46,659
I spent the whole last 10 minutes of the stream. I mean people tell me how stupid I was

3916
06:03:47,220 --> 06:03:49,220
How dumb of a person I am

3917
06:03:49,220 --> 06:03:54,590
That was that was like the last 20 minutes of that was like actually the about six hours of the stream

3918
06:03:58,740 --> 06:04:01,299
So wait, i'm allowed to take the harassment here

3919
06:04:03,419 --> 06:04:11,619
huh

3920
06:04:11,619 --> 06:04:13,619
When I say one thing

3921
06:04:27,819 --> 06:04:36,080
In like a joking manner all of a sudden i'm like the joker from batman

3922
06:04:50,049 --> 06:05:07,459
I get to be the one guy sometimes come on

3923
06:05:08,220 --> 06:05:11,819
You gotta give me a little bit. I like you gotta give me a little bit of slack

3924
06:05:23,970 --> 06:05:29,659
We fuck around here a lot but half the shit that is said in this stream would get you banned somewhere else

3925
06:05:30,060 --> 06:05:49,700
And you know it come on. So we have a pretty light atmosphere here

3926
06:05:50,020 --> 06:06:20,240
I say a lot of shit and get banned for it be the bigger person in any room

3927
06:06:20,880 --> 06:06:26,319
Oh, I get it. See? All right. So, all right. All right. Look at that. Look it's being spanned right now

3928
06:06:27,180 --> 06:06:30,459
Look, do you see this? You see like what?

3929
06:06:31,340 --> 06:06:40,979
What that shit's

3930
06:06:40,979 --> 06:06:54,700
Uh, and i'm at zero we're in the middle of talking about like shit talking

3931
06:06:55,259 --> 06:06:57,259
And I look over and I see a shit talk

3932
06:06:58,049 --> 06:07:18,669
Coffee pasta you guys are on point. I'll give you that joke was so good. It fucking killed him

3933
06:07:20,529 --> 06:07:52,849
But anyways, let us move on the coffee pasta is so elaborate because

3934
06:07:54,259 --> 06:07:56,259
People can come up with some crazy shit

3935
06:08:03,459 --> 06:08:09,709
But we had let's uh, almost at the end here. We had ten dollars from all mu for thank you all mu

3936
06:08:09,950 --> 06:08:19,680
Hey, germa was out with my girlfriend the other night at a bar. We were pleasantly surprised to see you

3937
06:08:20,240 --> 06:08:22,560
Kim and shito there, but you seemed a little off

3938
06:08:22,959 --> 06:08:26,479
I saw that you ordered enough pbr to make yourself almost pass out and even be sick

3939
06:08:27,040 --> 06:08:31,599
we didn't want to go up and say anything because we saw shito and kim carrying you home as you stumbled and

3940
06:08:32,159 --> 06:08:34,080
a drunk fit

3941
06:08:34,080 --> 06:08:37,759
I just want to ask what's the deal with you lying so much. I really want you to be a better person

3942
06:08:45,970 --> 06:08:51,330
Thank you for the ten dollars. I appreciate i'm gonna i'm drinking pbr tomorrow

06:09:02,770 --> 06:09:05,169
Germa lied about taco bell. Thanks for the 250

3945
06:09:05,889 --> 06:09:08,849
I saw germa out at a wendy's he high-fived the cashier and then winked at me

3946
06:09:08,849 --> 06:09:12,930
He was super nice to everyone right up until he pulled his pants down and shit on the floor

3947
06:09:18,319 --> 06:09:23,779
Son of jenova, thanks for the three dollars. Hi. I love you. Watch this, please

3948
06:09:23,779 --> 06:09:25,779
It's probably what's gonna happen to you tomorrow

3949
06:09:42,369 --> 06:09:44,930
Hey, don't tell him penis

3950
06:09:49,650 --> 06:09:51,810
I'm not allowed to do that. Come on

3951
06:10:06,529 --> 06:10:08,529
Nobody said you can't

3952
06:10:19,919 --> 06:10:22,880
It probably is what's gonna happen, but i'll be i'll be on top of it. Don't worry

3953
06:10:23,439 --> 06:10:26,400
I'm gonna flex my fucking tiny muscles

06:10:39,200 --> 06:11:21,040
Where's the sour place? Come on. I was there it is. That's what I was waiting for

Hey germa, are you going to join the vine sauce charity stream?

3959
06:11:36,930 --> 06:11:40,270
It'd be good time for vine wrestle versus germa rumble with joe

3960
06:11:41,380 --> 06:11:42,500
I don't know

3961
06:11:42,500 --> 06:11:44,180
That's a really good question

3962
06:11:44,180 --> 06:11:45,860
i'll have to

3963
06:11:45,860 --> 06:11:48,220
I don't really have an answer for you

3964
06:11:48,220 --> 06:11:53,229
But it's a great charity. They do awesome stuff

3965
06:11:55,229 --> 06:11:59,310
They do it every year, right? So I mean, I maybe we'll see I I can't give you an answer

3966
06:11:59,310 --> 06:12:01,630
I don't want to tell you that's gonna happen and then it doesn't right so

3967
06:12:02,349 --> 06:12:08,450
But thank you for the 250 definitely something to look into right?

3968
06:12:10,959 --> 06:12:13,279

I've never picked up on that

3976
06:13:00,020 --> 06:13:03,540
Maybe it's when the internet kicks out and it calls it to fuck up. That's weird

3977
06:13:05,540 --> 06:13:07,220
But thank you everybody

3978
06:13:07,220 --> 06:13:12,459

Minecraft vr lie

3980
06:13:16,349 --> 06:13:17,950

Uh, mr. Comcast go thank you. Thanks for three dollars. Comcast a germ of john comcast

3982
06:13:24,880 --> 06:13:26,959
You're just letting you know that I saw you last night six flags

3983
06:13:27,040 --> 06:13:27,680
Okay

3984
06:13:27,680 --> 06:13:32,479
You were screaming and shouting at the 16 year old ride attendant for not letting you on the teacups because you were under the height limit

3985
06:13:33,630 --> 06:13:35,389
Found it awkward when you didn't

3986
06:13:35,389 --> 06:13:40,669
When you ddt the park supervisor threw a hot dog stand and stole some candy off a five-year-old child that was sitting on a park bench

3987
06:13:41,069 --> 06:13:44,830
It got so bad that police showed up, but you stole a captain crunch mascot outfit and escaped

3988
06:13:46,419 --> 06:13:52,180
I'm glad I got away

3989
06:13:52,180 --> 06:13:58,259
In this fake story, it's not real but I can the good thing I hit manned out of there in the captain crunched uniform

3990
06:14:01,279 --> 06:14:04,959
Finally the sand witch thank you the sandwich for 250

3991
06:14:06,700 --> 06:14:10,939
German I want to say that I hope you know that at least 98 percent of us love you and we know that you're messing around

3992
06:14:11,580 --> 06:14:14,540
Have a good night. Thanks for helping me get through the semester with your kind personality

3993
06:14:15,180 --> 06:14:19,740
I know i'm messing around but people think i'm not messing around and then they get mad at me for messing around

3994
06:14:19,740 --> 06:14:23,979
But then people mess around with me all the time then like uh, it's a it's a circle. I gotta close

3995
06:14:24,860 --> 06:14:44,740
I don't think anyone actually gets mad people do though. They do

3996
06:14:46,779 --> 06:14:51,099
We can't you can't tell that we're joking is easy. Yeah, but you can you can tell I know

3997
06:14:51,740 --> 06:14:55,180
Shit is just a joke and I know when people are actually irritated about something

3998
06:14:55,740 --> 06:15:12,479
Start to tell if someone is angry through text. Yeah, but you can

3999
06:15:13,360 --> 06:15:16,450
You can tell

4000
06:15:16,450 --> 06:15:30,270
I ban them. No, you don't get banned in this channel for like making fun of the streamer

4001
06:15:31,169 --> 06:15:34,779
That's what I was referring to

4002
06:15:34,779 --> 06:15:36,939
There are a lot of scenarios where it you

4003
06:15:37,819 --> 06:15:40,220
Talk shit to the person streaming. They'll just be like bye

4004
06:15:44,080 --> 06:15:46,240
We have like a joke kind of here about it

4005
06:15:46,799 --> 06:16:00,430
But the streamer can't get banned for making fun of the chat. No because you're in this this is they're in this is the streamer's house

4006
06:16:10,849 --> 06:16:12,849
You're in my house. You're in my house

4007
06:16:12,849 --> 06:16:18,520
He's gonna get evicted. No one's getting evicted

4008
06:16:19,080 --> 06:16:29,700
Refusing to show Otto's feet

4009
06:16:30,340 --> 06:16:32,340
You've seen him already. You've seen it already

4010
06:16:36,229 --> 06:16:40,150
But finally before the stream ends, I got those tendies with the honey mustard sauce good

4011
06:16:40,709 --> 06:16:43,139
I hope it's fucking delish

4012
06:16:48,610 --> 06:16:50,610
As always, thanks for watching everybody. See you tomorrow

4013
06:16:51,250 --> 06:16:56,479
Where's your restroom? I don't have one

4014
06:16:56,479 --> 06:16:58,080
We pee outside

4015
06:16:58,080 --> 06:17:07,169
That was a lot of fun. I'd say I've access great. It's I've had a lot of fun tonight

4016
06:17:07,650 --> 06:17:22,799
Can you do you crack me up little buddy as Elmo Thanos doing a Sam impression?

4017
06:17:23,439 --> 06:17:25,439
I don't think I can do that

4018
06:17:26,919 --> 06:17:28,919
Am I gonna do season three? I I don't know

4019
06:17:31,380 --> 06:17:43,349
I don't know once season two is over. I'll see if I'd want to keep going

4020
06:17:45,889 --> 06:17:50,369
After season two, I might stop salmon max for a little while just to do some other things

4021
06:17:50,849 --> 06:17:52,849
Because it's been taken up. Um

4022
06:17:53,250 --> 06:17:55,970
You know at least one or two streams a week the last couple weeks have been

4023
06:17:56,770 --> 06:17:58,930
Sam and max so maybe i'll put it uh in the

4024
06:17:59,889 --> 06:18:02,069
On the shelf for a few weeks

4025
06:18:02,069 --> 06:18:04,069
But we're gonna do at least season two completely

4026
06:18:10,020 --> 06:18:13,409
And we'll see after that we'll go from there

4027
06:18:13,409 --> 06:18:16,229
I'll see you tomorrow

4028
06:18:16,229 --> 06:18:18,229
Have a wonderful rest of your night

4029
06:18:18,799 --> 06:18:20,080

06:18:20,080 --> 06:18:24,360
Goodbye, and i'm gonna feed everybody in stream legends. Hope you're ready

4031
06:18:24,840 --> 06:18:36,869
Take care everybody. See you real soon

Bye. Bye
