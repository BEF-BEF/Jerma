1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:06,059
Ooh. Oh, he got me! He got us! Hey, happy Halloween.

2
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:13,990
How are ya? Uh, those of you that are trick-or-treating,

3
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:27,620
aren't you a little old for that? Go back inside.

4
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:34,539
I'm five. Well, you're a super genius. How did you find this stream if you're

5
00:00:34,539 --> 00:00:48,549
five? Same, same, same. I got recommended this

6
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:56,490
channel on Roblox. Oh, nice! What is this? 8 out of 10

7
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:00,539
germa? What is this? Do I need to watch this? 8 out of 10

8
00:01:00,619 --> 00:01:06,810
germa impression? Wait, why can I only get this through one

9
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,950
headphone? All right, hold on. Let me listen to this.

10
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:24,280
Okay, what is it? Is this like, is this like your stream?

11
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:31,640
Am I able to like listen to a clip of your stream?

12
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,569
Link it to me? I can't see it. I don't even like it. It scrolled by too fast.

13
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:43,510
It's Ster. What the fuck did he do now? What is he trying to do?

14
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:57,909
Why can I not hear this? Okay, you can hear this, but I can't.

15
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:03,640
For some insane reason. It's not going through my like

16
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:13,849
Vive headphones. Well, now what the fuck happened? I just broke everything.

17
00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:23,740
Now I can't hear anything coming through here. Hold on, open up my mixer.

18
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:31,110
What the fuck? It's not, it sounds not coming through my Vive headset anymore.

19
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:42,419
Now it is. Oh, here we go. Okay, here we go. What does he say?

20
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:57,189
2020. Okay. I don't think I can stream for four months.

21
00:02:57,189 --> 00:03:01,189
He doesn't even get it. He doesn't even, hold on.

22
00:03:01,669 --> 00:03:08,169
I'm putting this on stream. We need to break this down.

23
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:17,419
That's not even why that happened. Ster's impression of Germa

24
00:03:17,419 --> 00:03:29,509
in the year 2020. I don't think I can stream for four months.

25
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:35,030
Yeah, he's a funny guy. Yeah, nice form by the way.

26
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:39,750
Nice form by the way. Almost saw your balls on Twitch. Almost just got

27
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:49,030
permabanned, Star. Real funny. That was real close to a

28
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:54,949
ball sack on stream. It's close. Was it still funny?

29
00:03:54,949 --> 00:04:02,780
Yeah, it was pretty funny. All right, why don't I come over so you can

30
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:08,969
you can see this. This music is, why this,

31
00:04:08,969 --> 00:04:12,169
the scary music makes that so much worse.

32
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:18,439
This is like found footage of me watching Star

33
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:22,519
start making fun of me and then what does he like stalk me and murder me?

34
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:36,759
It started with one video clip. Bugle, we need Bugleberry.

35
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:41,029
I'm sorry to say Bugleberry actually contacted me.

36
00:04:41,029 --> 00:04:45,670
He was just rambling. He said that he's not into Halloween anymore.

37
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:48,389
He said he's different, he doesn't want to do it anymore, he doesn't want to be a

38
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:51,740
one-trick pony. He kind of went all over this. I was like,

39
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,579
what are you talking about? He started rambling about

40
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:58,620
different recipes he was working on and hams and turkeys and shit and I was like,

41
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,420
I was like, dude, just call me later. Like, you obviously kind of, you're

42
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:08,790
fucked up right now. Maybe I'll talk to him tomorrow, see what

43
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:17,540
he's up to. Anyways, yeah, we're gonna do VR tonight,

44
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:21,610
Halloween VR, which, no, don't turn it off, don't turn it off. I'm here, I'm here.

45
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,170
No, don't beep and turn it off, you fuckers. Don't.

46
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:40,149
Why? Don't do that. Okay, so. All right. Why is it the wrong hand?

47
00:05:40,149 --> 00:05:43,750
Stop opening the door and trying to kill me. Wait a minute, I need to make sure

48
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:47,350
this is on the right hand because I, if you don't use VR for fucking 10 minutes,

49
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:54,839
it turns everything off. All right, we're good. Let me, hey, let me, why don't we just,

50
00:05:54,839 --> 00:06:01,579
I'll just show you. What's up? You like my Halloween costume?

51
00:06:01,579 --> 00:06:04,540
I can't do a Halloween costume anymore. I'm 35. I can't, that's when you're not

52
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:12,629
allowed to wear a Halloween costume anymore. I just have to be MrTwitch.tv guy.

53
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:15,990
You're a man-child. No, I would be a man-child if I was in a

54
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,230
Halloween costume, like of Sonic the Hedgehog,

55
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:26,459
right? No, I'm a professional Twitch virtual reality streamer. Yes, I was

56
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:30,779
Naruto last year, but I was still in the 18 to 34 drop-down bracket.

57
00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:35,100
I can't do that anymore. See you next year when I'm dressed up like a fucking

58
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:49,509
pineapple. Happy Halloween. Let's go. You ready?

59
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:57,980
Clip that. Good, clip it. I'll be a pineapple next year.

60
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:01,740
Did I gain weight? I gained a shitload of weight. Yeah, thank you for asking. I

61
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:09,000
gained about 20 pounds. We relax and we just wait until we go

62
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,959
into a live stream, okay? Especially if you, you know how it's

63
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:18,600
like. I know it's a small window. I'll fix it.

64
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,759
Full screen. I know, I will, I will. Motherfucker, we're gonna do like five or six games tonight.

65
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:26,920
It's gonna be nuts. Starting with, what's the name of this game?

66
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:32,860
Affect the Manor? Affected the Manor is the name of this game.

67
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:37,699
This game's apparently only like, it's loud.

68
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:41,939
Uh, this game is apparently only like 20 minutes long. It's just a haunted house.

69
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:46,839
So we're gonna do Haunted House and then we're gonna move on to Hospitality VR

70
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:50,540
and then we're doing Five Nights at Fucking Freddy's VR.

71
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:55,689
It's all VR and it's all scary. And then if we're gonna do Walking Dead VR,

72
00:07:55,689 --> 00:07:59,129
we're gonna do, there's a lot. I'm going in. You guys ready?

73
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:06,300
You need anything else from me before we start? This is why I wanted to start a

74
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,300
little later too. I wanted to be like night time.

75
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:15,029
Put it full screen. Yeah, I got it. See? See?

76
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:18,949
Um, is the space game too big? I've gotten a good spawn.

77
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:24,300
Underwear. Those of you that were in the pre-stream chat, we were talking about if

78
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,060
I were to walk out here, be on stream like this,

79
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:32,139
and be like in VR. Oh, what's all scary? Look out!

80
00:08:32,139 --> 00:08:36,539
Oh, I got it with the lightsaber, right? And then after like 40 minutes, I back up

81
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:40,889
and it's just fucking white underwear and bare legs.

82
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:44,570
I wanted to, I did be like, I would do it. Well, I can't. Like, I would get, I would

83
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:48,710
get thrown off. And then like, I would look at the chat

84
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:51,509
and everyone would be like, dude, underwear, what the fuck?

85
00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:58,570
And I would, and then it would cut to a pre-recorded video of me waking up

86
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:06,620
in a bed and being like, oh shit, what a nightmare.

87
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:11,539
But yeah, I didn't do it. And then I like get out of bed and like come in here and

88
00:09:11,539 --> 00:09:20,809
I stream. Another time. Low effort streamer.

89
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:26,259
And maybe the last month. That's not even true though.

90
00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:31,350
He's getting drunk? I have like three of these.

91
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:34,549
This is like, this is the equivalent of drinking one beer.

92
00:09:34,549 --> 00:09:39,029
I don't, I'm not gonna get shitfaced off of three beers.

93
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:46,580
I'll get very talkative though. What am I drinking?

94
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:51,059
Uh, a thing that makes me an evil, an evil mastermind.

95
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:55,690
I'm just gonna switch between all the seltzers. That's like the new thing that

96
00:09:55,690 --> 00:10:01,399
I want to do. Not White Claw. This is truly the same

97
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:06,389
goddamn thing. Just different companies. Okay, I, I, okay, I had the Xbox. This is

98
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:11,210
the PlayStation. What's the Nintendo switch of the like

99
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:21,370
weird gross seltzer companies? The Bud Light one? I don't know. I

100
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:27,419
know. I feel like Bud Light would be Xbox. Truly, this is, this probably is the

101
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:38,259
switch. Oh, so I got it. You're drinking the Luigi of

102
00:10:38,259 --> 00:10:43,750
Drinks. It's, I actually don't even hate it. I,

103
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:47,669
look, it's, I know, it's fun to make fun of truly,

104
00:10:47,669 --> 00:10:51,899
right? And like White Claw. But look, if they're on sale,

105
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:55,340
you're gonna get them, right? If you're of drinking age and you want to drink a

106
00:10:55,340 --> 00:11:01,509
couple, if they're on sale, why not? Stop buying fancy Instagram drinks and

107
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:07,460
upgrade your PC. This was like four, this was like three dollars.

108
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:12,019
It's like, it's like six grand for a PC that I want to make.

109
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:19,210
Seven grand. It's fancy Instagram drink. I bought this twice in my life.

110
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:24,940
I'm getting a 3090. I'm getting a fucking 32 core PC.

111
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:28,379
I'm getting a fucking case that can embed into the wall.

112
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:33,179
I'm gonna get wireless everything. Wireless mouse, wireless keyboard, wireless

113
00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:35,659
microphone, wireless headphones, wireless

114
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:47,820
motherboard, everything. And I'm also, I'm gonna get a desk that can go

115
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,919
right here. I'm gonna, I'm gonna, it's gonna be

116
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:58,299
fucking incredible. Please don't waste money on a 3090.

117
00:11:58,299 --> 00:12:03,559
You know, I actually heard that. I heard that like, don't buy a 3090. What are you

118
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:07,000
stupid? It's like, it doesn't do anything. But I

119
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,200
got, I want to get it for the, the Nvink, the codec. I want it to be

120
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:18,470
rendering the stream at like fucking 1080. Instagram drinks. Do people like post

121
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:28,440
themselves drinking these on Instagram? Why? What? It's like, this is not, this is

122
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:34,820
not cool. This is cool. Am I cool for doing this?

123
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:38,299
Wait, hold on. Somebody get one of these. I'm gonna get an image of this.

124
00:12:38,379 --> 00:12:40,860
And I don't want you to put it like, I want you to put like the Instagram like

125
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:48,620
like and follow button and shit down here. And like put a filter on me. Put like a

126
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:54,860
bunch, put like six filters on me. I shouldn't have done that. I shouldn't

127
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:57,340
have done that because now like, okay, I have nothing to do with this fucking

128
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,899
company. I just bought this because I want to drink it so I like it.

129
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:07,269
I want like all the, like the dashboard of Instagram.

130
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:12,139
Stop advertising. I, I, but if I drink a Coke on stream, you're gonna see Coke. If

131
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:16,299
I drink a fucking Sprite on stream, how's that any different? It's the, it's

132
00:13:16,299 --> 00:13:29,179
the same thing. Don't I just put tape on this? Cover it up.

133
00:13:29,179 --> 00:13:34,220
Go put electrical tape on this. No, if I put electrical tape on this, this is not

134
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,340
truly, this is like some kind of weird fucking potion that I made.

135
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:46,490
That's like dangerous. All right, let's go. No more Stalin. Let's go.

136
00:13:46,490 --> 00:14:01,990
That's cool. VR sucks. Okay. All right, so thanks. VR

137
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:05,990
sucks. Oh, by the way, I'm ready to go tonight. You know why?

138
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:09,269
Can I show this? I'm just gonna show a little bit, okay? Just enough for you to

139
00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:17,289
see it. Where is it? Just enough for you to see.

140
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:23,509
I'm taped up today. I'm taped the fuck up today.

141
00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:26,950
I'm covered in like, in this like, in this fucking body tape and I'm ready to

142
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:33,429
take on the entire world. I got it going across my back. I go wrapping around

143
00:14:33,429 --> 00:14:53,000
here. Like a diaper. You have a colostomy bag on.

144
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,029
Why is he taped up? Because it's like body tape.

145
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:59,990
It's to like support your like muscles and back and chest. It's like, it's

146
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:03,940
support tape. Got it already? All right, look, when I

147
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:10,860
go in, I don't come out. All right, this is not the filter I was

148
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:16,220
talking about. This is not, no, I didn't want it to be like,

149
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:27,980
like a, like a nuclear bomb going off. This is like the sun exploded.

150
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:30,860
This is the last thing I do before the sun explodes.

151
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:39,509
Gotta get those likes on Instagram before the sun like takes over us all.

152
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:56,539
Hey, ah, sun just exploded. Might as well enjoy it with a fucking truly.

153
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:59,980
There's no way that I could get 2,000 likes on Instagram. What are you talking

154
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:03,820
about? I could get like 50,000. I'll show it,

155
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:07,379
I'll show you. What do you mean I can't get 2,000 likes on

156
00:16:07,379 --> 00:16:09,860
Instagram? Are you kidding me? If I had an Instagram, it would be

157
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:13,379
loaded with likes. Every like would be, it would be, it would be double liked.

158
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:18,570
It'd be 10,000. All right, I'm ready. Let's get, I'm gonna,

159
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:23,929
let me just try to finish my fucking blueberry and I almost just dropped it.

160
00:16:23,929 --> 00:16:35,480
Does Bugleberry have an Instagram? No, but I'm gonna be here for a while, okay?

161
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,820
This is all I got going on tonight. I'm not, I'm just, I'm gonna,

162
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:51,779
you got me tonight, okay? Dropped all of his loot.

163
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:56,279
All right, let's go. Already stalling. I'm not stalling. This, this game's only like

164
00:16:56,279 --> 00:17:00,899
10,000. All right, I'm ready. This is called, uh,

165
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:13,079
affected it the manner. The reason why this is like five times tighter than it was

166
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:18,599
three days ago. Why is it so tight? What happened? Oh shit, it's because

167
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:36,740
of this. I didn't do that. All right, that's better. Okay, let's go.

168
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:40,259
This is effect, this is a haunted house. You go through it, it takes about 15

169
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:44,170
minutes. Almost as long as I've been stalling,

170
00:17:44,170 --> 00:18:00,470
drinking, truleys on stream. Right or left? Just make this shit green

171
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:07,369
so I can fucking see it. Okay, you ready? Well, this is, this is

172
00:18:07,369 --> 00:18:13,420
horrifying. This is really scary sounds. Okay, this is

173
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:17,430
scary sounds. This is what you guys have been hearing

174
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:25,740
this whole time? Okay, I wanted to, where do I go?

175
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:42,539
Stop, gauntlet. Can I take a candle? I think I have to go this way. Here we

178
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,839

179
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:07,640
flashing images. Do not play if you have any known health issues or

182
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:28,220
thing? I mean, I have a few medical conditions.

183
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:45,140
Fucked. Don't die. Okay, that's the house. Can I go any faster?

184
00:19:45,220 --> 00:20:02,569
Fast as I can go. Oh, I already don't like this. I already hate this shit.

185
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:06,779
You guys know that before YouTube and Twitch,

186
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:14,730
I did not ever play scary games because I can't play them and I hate to play them.

187
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:26,839
I am of a nervous disposition. I don't, I hate this.

188
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:30,950
Damn. I have to be strong. It's Halloween night.

189
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:54,440
I think I need to wipe the lenses. What the fuck are you doing?

190
00:20:54,440 --> 00:21:32,519
Right? That's it, right? What? That was good.

191
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:36,680
That was really good. You know, I know that was good. You can,

192
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,319
you can minus two it if you want. I don't, I wasn't trying to be funny. I was showing

193
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:54,619
you how good I was. Alright, Satan door. That was, uh, I'm

194
00:21:54,619 --> 00:21:59,660
not ready for this part yet. I'm not ready for that yet. Is there

195
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:09,480
anything else I can do in here? Let's see what's behind door number two.

196
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:20,759
Oh, I don't want to go in there.

197
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:34,339
Ass cracked? Fuck off. What? Alright. In the house. I went through door

198
00:22:34,339 --> 00:22:53,079
number two. Can't go up there. Imagine doing this in

199
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:56,039
real life. Why would you ever do this in real life?

200
00:22:56,039 --> 00:23:00,440
I feel like ghost hunters and shit. Stay fucking home.

201
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:10,950
Stay home. That was horrible. Oh my god. I felt like my whole

202
00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:16,220
house exploded. Seven? Alright, this door is number seven. Remember that.

203
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:26,180
Like who cares if the place is haunted? Don't you think that's a little condescending

204
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:29,460
to the ghost that's there? Like the ghost is just trying to exist

205
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:33,690
in peace and you're in there with like your fucking ecto meter.

206
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:48,039
Hey, can you hear us? Like yeah, I can. Please get the fuck out of my house. I am

207
00:23:48,039 --> 00:24:03,559
on the nervous disposition. That was a kid laughing in reverse.

208
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:11,420
God damn it. For me it's a big brave adult man.

209
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:21,299
Thanks dude. Going deeper down into the house.

210
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:40,789
Shining. That's some shining little shit right here.

211
00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:44,950
Fuck. It's okay. What time is that? That would be

212
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:49,259
that's a six down there. Seven. That would be eight. That would be oh no. That's not

213
00:24:49,259 --> 00:24:51,980
pointing that way. That's uh that would be one.

214
00:24:51,980 --> 00:25:04,359
That's one ten. Come on. I'm kidding. It's fucking ten

215
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:23,130
o'clock. Ten ten. Leave me alone. Hey. I'm so jumpy tonight. Oh it's a

216
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:28,970
fucking Ouija board. Great. Fuck you. Don't do that. Okay if that

217
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:36,180
happens you can't blame that on like your drunk friend.

218
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:47,900
Ask it a question. What's your name? B? Holy shit the fucking things have

219
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:52,819
flyed out. That's what I'm gonna look like in an

220
00:25:52,819 --> 00:25:58,039
hour when I take the headset off. It's Abraham Lincoln.

221
00:25:58,119 --> 00:26:04,170
Oh don't come out of the painting. Don't come out of the painting.

222
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:13,019
You were gonna come out of the fucking painting. Actually pretty fucking scary.

223
00:26:13,019 --> 00:26:22,619
What? I didn't get to play this thing. Orgrab.

224
00:26:22,619 --> 00:26:29,210
It was kind of a lore grab. And face. All right I'm going left hand.

225
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:33,670
Put it down. It's like interference. This is a microphone.

226
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:36,549
Don't literally pick a microphone up next to the speaker. What are you

227
00:26:36,549 --> 00:26:51,660
supposed to be the audio guy? Fuck off. All right I can't go that way.

228
00:26:51,660 --> 00:27:06,579
This sucks. It's already gonna be in the bed in about five seconds.

229
00:27:06,579 --> 00:27:11,140
I'm so I'm so glad that there are like 70,000 people here watching this.

230
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:26,759
I know that you're here with me so like it's not as bad. Hey

231
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:36,839
I see a shadow. Is that my shadow or is that their shadow?

232
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:53,130
Find out. Is that? Is it painting? I don't. I hate. I want like a gun or

233
00:27:53,130 --> 00:28:01,480
something or like a knife. Give me a weapon please. It's gonna

234
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:11,319
change. Uh don't. I'm waiting for it to change.

235
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:19,180
No please. Why would you have this shit in your house?

236
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:23,259
All right I'm sorry. Is it weird for me to say that if you have paintings like

237
00:28:23,259 --> 00:28:26,460
this all over your house you're a fucking psycho.

238
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:30,220
Like these are fucking psychotic paintings. You can't you don't relax in

239
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,859
this house. Who relaxes and eats dinner here?

240
00:28:32,859 --> 00:28:35,980
Like you get chicken and rice and you sit there with like the pictures of

241
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:39,420
people's heads being torn off. If you own pictures like this you keep

242
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:42,059
them like in a vault or something. You don't show them in your house. You're

243
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:46,549
gonna scare the fuck out anybody that you can't have friends over with a

244
00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:50,819
painting like that. Because they're all gonna come over

245
00:28:50,819 --> 00:28:52,900
they're gonna be like oh dude nice place cool.

00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:12,859
Don't that's an uncomfortable painting man. Oh what's this shit?

249
00:29:12,859 --> 00:29:17,720

00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:45,829
Everything behind me is getting thrown behind me. Like whatever I walk by is

268
00:31:45,829 --> 00:31:50,630
getting ripped behind me. I'm just gonna stop pissing. I'm

269
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:54,630
gonna start making like a piss stain like piss spots or like just slip on it.

275
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:52,859

Ayayay. Uh I said ayayay not ayayaya. There I know I'm turning around.

278
00:33:24,789 --> 00:33:58,059
Oh a map to the treasure. Can I take this?

279
00:33:58,059 --> 00:34:09,880
Baby are you all right? Where's the baby? Baby? Oh my fucking Jesus.

00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:30,309
God damn it you piece of fucking shit. Oh oh quick piss and run.

281
00:34:30,309 --> 00:34:35,699
But then as a thing I would be like okay it's time to get out of here.

282
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:40,420
All right what? I would fucking my keel would go up and I'd let out my back

283
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:50,519
and then she would just eat my soul. I would home alone myself in that

284
00:34:50,519 --> 00:35:04,469
scenario. Hey look how hard I can five more months of what? Just dying in a pool

285
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:10,920
of his own piss. I don't dream of that I'm just saying that's a realistic

286
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:28,630
scenario. Phone in the bed?

287
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:40,780
Shut that up. That's horrifying. Why do you have all this?

288
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:46,139
You're fucking scary. You're scary if you have all this stuff.

289
00:35:46,139 --> 00:36:08,500
I can't turn it off. Get out. I'm gonna I think I'm I think I'm

290
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:25,099
gonna need some truly power after this. I suppose it's to be a little girl you

291
00:36:25,179 --> 00:36:32,059
know? It's never just gonna be like an armadillo or something like a dog or a

292
00:36:32,059 --> 00:36:46,010
cat. Could it be an evil cat? A very little girl.

293
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:49,289
Oh I hurt myself. I just hurt myself. I hurt myself.

294
00:36:49,289 --> 00:36:53,610
I hurt myself. I hurt myself. I smashed my fucking thumb.

295
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:57,420
I'm gonna have I got I'm hurt. I got hurt.

296
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:00,460
I got hurt because I'm wearing I'm holding two giant ice cream cones. I

297
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,780
don't know why they made them like this in the first place.

298
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:15,239
Why did they make them like this in the first place? It's like why make them

299
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:21,019
just huge fishing rods? I gotta get the index controllers.

300
00:37:21,019 --> 00:37:26,900
Bad. Because if you get too close like this you're gonna smash.

301
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:30,019

313
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:16,139
and be like I knew you were gonna be there. That's why I didn't like that.

314
00:39:16,139 --> 00:39:25,219
That's why I didn't like that. Don't move.

315
00:39:25,219 --> 00:39:30,969
Yeah just just a little further. Yeah I swear to god I got an 80 inch tv in here.

One two three don't do it. I'm just getting hit with various pieces of wood

323
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:05,300
into my back. That's what this game is. I have a

324
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:08,820
blindfold on and somebody is going to my back and say you ready?

325
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:12,840
When I don't know it's gonna happen they count to three and do it on two.

326
00:41:30,869 --> 00:41:48,219
That's not a bad picture whatever. This house is huge.

00:41:48,219 --> 00:42:01,289
Come on piano. Gotta save us here piano. Gotta save us piano.

Go back to that tv show. Pretty cool. I just gotta make it to the door.

00:43:54,260 --> 00:44:09,610
Make it to the door. Make it to the door. I gotta be ready. Here comes like up.

336
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:23,849
Did you open? Oh you you dropped all the stuff.

337
00:44:23,849 --> 00:44:37,750
I don't have a flashlight though. This is bad. That was the playing music in the

00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:53,130
beginning right? Oh tense. That's just too it's just my

bullshit. Get out of here with this bullshit.

342
00:45:27,590 --> 00:45:30,789
If I was pregnant I would get Disney World. That's how it works.

343
00:45:30,789 --> 00:45:56,250
You guys ever heard that weird like conspiracy theory?

eyes and you guys won't even know I'm closing my eyes.

348
00:46:53,559 --> 00:46:59,510
That's a huge big brain moment. I could just close my eyes.

349
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:02,869
When I know something really scary is gonna happen I'll just close my eyes.

350
00:47:02,869 --> 00:47:19,260
One of these is gonna take them. Take them. One of those is coming off.

351
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:33,000
My body is so hot and sweaty right now. You know that one of these is coming off

352
00:47:33,000 --> 00:48:14,980
and they're gonna drop at me. Did I lose? Jesus. What the hell would

353
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:25,780

00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:30,619
just various jump scares that scream like at you. I'm just curious. I just

355
00:48:30,619 --> 00:48:36,260
want to know what it is. What's the gauntlet? It's gonna be just

356
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:42,440
screams in your face. Instructions. Hold the trigger to

357
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:47,019
accelerate. The longer you hold the faster you go. Your speed and the

358
00:48:47,019 --> 00:48:51,179
amount that you scream will be rated. Please make sure the microphone is on.

359
00:48:51,179 --> 00:48:59,739
What? That's really what this is. It's not on.

360
00:48:59,739 --> 00:49:11,579
It's not on. Hold on. How do I turn it on? I'm

00:49:11,579 --> 00:49:25,510

What is this? Come on. Get out of my way. Oh shit. It's gonna be a light.

363
00:49:50,039 --> 00:49:56,119
It's gonna be an electricity puzzle at the end of this.

364
00:49:56,119 --> 00:50:29,000
What's my rating? An A plus? Hurry. This is what's like

365
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:37,940
running out of this guy's house. Get the fuck away from me.

He was just trying to kill me. Move. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go.

371
00:51:29,539 --> 00:52:08,920
Come on. I lost an ear. I lost an ear. I lost an ear.

00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:33,190
Idol. That's just that's just all of my streams.

00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:42,539
affected the manner. It was that was awful.

375
00:52:42,539 --> 00:52:49,190
Not awful in like oh the game was bad. It was just it was fucking too much.

376
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:52,550
And you know how you feel when you get off of the scariest ride in the theme

377
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:56,070
park? The one with like a 300 foot drop and you

378
00:52:56,070 --> 00:52:58,230
get off and you're like holy shit that was horrible.

379
00:52:58,230 --> 00:53:01,750
I had fun but like that was terrible. I don't ever want to do that again.

432
00:59:25,239 --> 00:59:28,360
uh since Demon Lord Zaraxos made that awful video that I

433
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:32,650

438
01:00:54,039 --> 01:01:05,159

444
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:04,179
That's not Freddy. That's a guy.

That's Happy and Hoppy.

446

01:02:23,059 --> 01:02:25,059
Put a Truly. Put a Truly over there and put a filter on it.

448
01:02:25,059 --> 01:02:32,760
That's the same picture I took.

449
01:02:33,639 --> 01:02:39,239
It's mostly just legal mumbo jumbo and isn't at all based on user experiences thus far.

01:02:39,239 --> 01:02:44,199
Volumes low. Injuries associated with testing. Just touch the button to agree

451
01:02:44,199 --> 01:02:48,039
and then we can jump right into some harmless fun that can't harm you at all.

452
01:02:48,039 --> 01:02:56,300
I got you. Thank you. I got you. I got you.

6am. I hate this game. I just spit all over myself

533
01:16:57,260 --> 01:17:00,060
because I didn't know that he was going to be up under my face

534
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:04,140
and in my nose. I thought he was going to jump this way so when I was looking

535
01:17:04,140 --> 01:17:08,140
down like this and he was here like underneath like under the water

536
01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:26,069
peek into the hallway and peek down the hallway. Holy shit really?

537
01:17:26,069 --> 01:18:18,859
So that's there so you can't cheat. Molly. God help us.

538
01:18:18,859 --> 01:18:23,670
I'm gonna need a second. I did not think that was gonna happen.

539
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:45,829
Down the fucking hallway. My god. Scream like a monkey. That was that was

540
01:18:45,829 --> 01:18:49,029
the worst RNG you possibly could have gotten. What?

541
01:18:49,029 --> 01:18:54,939
It was RNG. No that's like a you're peeking you're cheating so we're gonna

542
01:18:54,939 --> 01:19:07,319
end the game. What? What do you mean no it's not? It

543
01:19:07,319 --> 01:19:10,520
wasn't even two seconds in the first second level

544
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:28,739
of the first game. Go in again and find out.

545
01:19:28,739 --> 01:19:33,300
I fucking knew it. I knew it.

546
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:42,460
It's bad RNG. Do it again. I don't want to do that one anymore. I don't

547
01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:45,979
like this. I hate this. It's too stressful for me. I want to do

548
01:19:45,979 --> 01:19:49,180

01:29:31,619 --> 01:30:27,890
I want to drink that truly so bad right now, you have no idea.

612
01:30:28,890 --> 01:30:38,229
Are you having fun yet?

613
01:30:38,229 --> 01:30:39,229
That's great to hear.

614
01:30:39,229 --> 01:30:40,229
That's pretty good.

615
01:30:40,229 --> 01:30:41,229
It's actually pretty fun.

616
01:30:41,229 --> 01:30:46,109
If you like Five Nights at Freddy's, I mean, this is just that, but ten times worse.

617
01:30:46,109 --> 01:30:51,020
I know, I would say a hundred times worse for your, like, anxiety.

618
01:30:51,020 --> 01:31:01,250
That's what I'm doing- look, I'm never going to beat night two with three.

619
01:31:01,250 --> 01:31:02,250
Sit down, dude.

620
01:31:02,250 --> 01:31:03,250
It's way better.

621
01:31:03,250 --> 01:31:11,390
Uh, I mean, that does make sense to sit down.

622
01:31:11,390 --> 01:31:12,390
I know.

623
01:31:12,390 --> 01:31:13,390
Look out for Foxy.

624
01:31:13,390 --> 01:31:14,390
He'll sprint out here.

625
01:31:14,390 --> 01:31:44,239
Uh, oh.

626
01:31:44,239 --> 01:31:57,829
Come on, do it!

627
01:31:57,829 --> 01:32:15,010
What do I do with Foxy?

628
01:32:15,010 --> 01:32:35,829
Shit, I lost the chicken.

629
01:32:35,829 --> 01:32:46,909
Who am I missing?

630
01:32:46,909 --> 01:32:47,909
Where's Foxy?

631
01:32:47,909 --> 01:32:50,819
Hello?

632
01:32:50,819 --> 01:32:51,819
Hello?

633
01:32:51,819 --> 01:32:52,819
Hello?

634
01:32:52,819 --> 01:33:05,319
Am I good?

635
01:33:05,319 --> 01:33:06,319
Are you good?

636
01:33:06,319 --> 01:33:07,319
We're good.

637
01:33:07,319 --> 01:33:09,069
Okay.

638
01:33:09,069 --> 01:33:12,069
Chicken's coming down left hallway here.

639
01:33:12,069 --> 01:33:16,619
Hello?

640
01:33:16,619 --> 01:33:18,119
What does that mean?

641
01:33:18,119 --> 01:33:19,119
It's the balloon kid.

642
01:33:20,420 --> 01:33:22,420
Alright, balloon kid is currently in the bed right now.

643
01:33:22,420 --> 01:33:24,420
What do I do about- shine a light in his eyes.

644
01:33:24,420 --> 01:33:25,729
Is that what you do?

645
01:33:25,729 --> 01:33:27,800
What do you do?

646
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:28,800
Do I shine a light in his eyes?

647
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:32,340
Can my ass go work on?

648
01:33:32,340 --> 01:33:33,340
Hey, you little fuck.

649
01:33:33,340 --> 01:33:41,819
Alright, he's gone?

650
01:33:41,819 --> 01:33:42,819
Is he gone?

651
01:33:42,819 --> 01:33:43,819
Get back on!

652
01:33:43,819 --> 01:33:45,760
Where is he?

653
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:46,760
What?

654
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:47,760
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

655
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:50,920
Get her in the fucking bed, too!

656
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:54,340
Away from me!

657
01:33:54,340 --> 01:33:55,340
Okay.

658
01:33:55,340 --> 01:34:03,100
AHHHH!

659
01:34:03,100 --> 01:34:06,010
Away from me!

660
01:34:06,010 --> 01:34:07,250
Leave!

661
01:34:07,250 --> 01:34:10,020
Leave!

662
01:34:10,020 --> 01:34:13,380
Leave!

663
01:34:13,380 --> 01:34:14,619
Leave!

664
01:34:14,619 --> 01:34:15,619
Leave!

665
01:34:15,619 --> 01:34:16,619
Leave!

666
01:34:16,619 --> 01:34:17,920
Leave!

667
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:18,920
Leave!

668
01:34:18,920 --> 01:34:19,920
I saw somebody else!

669
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:20,920
Leave!

670
01:34:22,220 --> 01:34:25,000
Shine a light in his face!

671
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:33,640
Get away from me, Freddy!

672
01:34:33,640 --> 01:34:34,640
Is he still there?

673
01:34:34,640 --> 01:34:36,640
He's fucking still there!

674
01:34:39,949 --> 01:34:58,260
Freddy!

675
01:34:58,260 --> 01:35:00,260
Leave me the fuck alone, Freddy!

676
01:35:00,260 --> 01:35:10,460
Is he gone?

677
01:35:10,460 --> 01:35:12,460
Why would you leave me alone, Freddy?

678
01:35:12,460 --> 01:35:14,460
Leave me alone, Freddy!

679
01:35:14,460 --> 01:35:21,460
Hey!

680
01:35:21,460 --> 01:35:29,229
Hey!

681
01:35:29,229 --> 01:35:30,229
Hey!

682
01:35:30,229 --> 01:35:31,899
Where the fuck is he?

683
01:35:31,899 --> 01:35:33,210
Where is he?

684
01:35:33,210 --> 01:35:34,210
Okay.

685
01:35:34,210 --> 01:35:37,050
Wait!

686
01:35:37,050 --> 01:35:41,100
Hey!

687
01:35:41,100 --> 01:35:47,659
Alright.

688
01:35:47,659 --> 01:35:48,659
No.

689
01:35:48,659 --> 01:35:49,659
I can't put this thing...

690
01:35:57,789 --> 01:35:58,789
Hello?

691
01:36:11,930 --> 01:36:13,420
Ring it.

692
01:36:13,420 --> 01:36:14,789
Ring it.

693
01:36:14,789 --> 01:36:15,789
Ring it.

694
01:36:15,789 --> 01:36:16,789
Holy fuck.

695
01:36:16,789 --> 01:36:32,500
I didn't even mean to do that.

696
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:36,300
I won.

697
01:36:36,300 --> 01:36:40,859
Gamer instinct.

698
01:36:40,859 --> 01:36:42,739
Stick of butter.

699
01:36:42,739 --> 01:36:44,939
Stick of butter.

700
01:36:44,939 --> 01:36:46,939
I don't know why we have a stick of butter.

701
01:36:46,939 --> 01:36:56,220
Game for babies.

702
01:36:56,220 --> 01:36:59,880
Uh.

703
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:00,880
Night 3.

704
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:04,569
Do I dare even attempt Night 3?

705
01:37:04,569 --> 01:37:05,569
Sure.

706
01:37:05,569 --> 01:37:06,569
If I'm gonna...

707
01:37:06,569 --> 01:37:07,569
I mean, I'm gonna go...

708
01:37:07,569 --> 01:37:08,569
This is where the game gets real.

709
01:37:08,569 --> 01:37:10,319
Right?

710
01:37:10,319 --> 01:37:11,319
I'm now out of the tutorial.

711
01:37:11,319 --> 01:37:21,300
I know how it works.

712
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:22,300
Hot damn stone cold.

713
01:37:22,300 --> 01:37:24,300
This is where the real game begins.

714
01:37:24,300 --> 01:37:25,539
Yeah.

715
01:37:25,539 --> 01:37:36,319
Take a look.

716
01:37:36,319 --> 01:37:43,770
Yeah.

717
01:37:43,770 --> 01:37:44,770
I think so.

718
01:37:44,770 --> 01:37:46,770
Oxy did appear in the hallway.

719
01:37:49,770 --> 01:37:54,060
Chicken's already gone.

720
01:38:00,569 --> 01:38:01,569
Where's the chicken?

721
01:38:02,569 --> 01:38:04,189
Chicken in here?

722
01:38:08,850 --> 01:38:16,550
Where did you go?

723
01:38:18,550 --> 01:38:36,390
Get out of here, man.

724
01:38:37,390 --> 01:38:38,390
Come on, man.

725
01:38:40,020 --> 01:38:41,020
Get out of here, man.

726
01:38:43,020 --> 01:38:55,649
Dude.

727
01:38:55,649 --> 01:38:58,100
You?

728
01:38:58,100 --> 01:39:00,180
This person there pissed me.

729
01:39:00,180 --> 01:39:13,770
Shit.

730
01:39:13,770 --> 01:39:15,520
Where's the bird?

731
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:17,140
Where's the...

732
01:39:17,140 --> 01:39:18,140
Where's the...

733
01:39:18,140 --> 01:39:19,140
Yes.

734
01:39:19,140 --> 01:39:25,699
Yeah.

735
01:39:25,699 --> 01:39:26,699
Yeah.

736
01:39:26,699 --> 01:39:27,699
Yeah.

737
01:39:27,699 --> 01:39:28,699
Yeah.

738
01:39:28,699 --> 01:39:29,699
Yeah.

739
01:39:29,699 --> 01:39:38,869
You.

740
01:39:38,869 --> 01:39:42,140
Yeah.

741
01:39:42,140 --> 01:39:43,510
You.

742
01:39:43,510 --> 01:39:44,510
Oh.

743
01:39:44,510 --> 01:39:48,630
Chicken?

744
01:39:48,630 --> 01:39:54,609
Yeah.

745
01:39:56,300 --> 01:39:59,109
How did you get through my shield?

746
01:39:59,109 --> 01:40:01,109
How did you get through my shield?

747
01:40:01,109 --> 01:40:04,310
I had a shield.

748
01:40:04,310 --> 01:40:05,310
What?

749
01:40:05,310 --> 01:40:06,310
What happened?

750
01:40:06,310 --> 01:40:10,239
How did he get through the shield?

751
01:40:10,239 --> 01:40:11,239
How did he get through the shield?

752
01:40:11,239 --> 01:40:18,020
Oxy is defeated by the flashlight.

753
01:40:18,020 --> 01:40:19,020
Oh, right.

754
01:40:19,020 --> 01:40:20,020
You have to like...

755
01:40:20,020 --> 01:40:21,020
And he'll go away.

756
01:40:21,020 --> 01:40:22,779
All right.

757
01:40:22,779 --> 01:40:28,750
Let's go back to the basement.

758
01:40:28,750 --> 01:40:31,750
Every jump scare, I get electrocuted with 200 volts.

759
01:40:31,750 --> 01:40:35,909
That's just what your body does.

760
01:40:35,909 --> 01:40:36,909
I've been...

761
01:40:36,909 --> 01:40:37,909
Fuck.

762
01:40:37,909 --> 01:40:39,909
I'm gonna change the title of this stream.

763
01:40:39,909 --> 01:40:42,909
Watch a guy get electrocuted over and over again.

764
01:40:42,909 --> 01:40:44,539
You know what?

765
01:40:44,539 --> 01:40:48,539
If anyone wanted to make like a compilation of all the jump scares, but put like a...

766
01:40:48,539 --> 01:40:50,539
Like electricity noise before it.

767
01:40:50,539 --> 01:40:53,479
Just guys shocking himself.

768
01:40:53,479 --> 01:41:00,539
What happened?

769
01:41:00,539 --> 01:41:07,029
Oy vey.

770
01:41:07,029 --> 01:41:11,600
From a race car?

771
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:15,760
I don't know what that is.

772
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:16,760
Get me out of here.

773
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:35,659
Shut it down.

774
01:41:35,659 --> 01:41:36,659
Shut it down.

775
01:41:36,659 --> 01:41:37,659
No escape.

776
01:41:37,659 --> 01:41:38,840
Would you recommend it against sleepiness?

777
01:41:38,840 --> 01:41:40,140
What?

778
01:41:40,140 --> 01:41:41,140
Did it break?

779
01:41:41,140 --> 01:41:48,270
Shut it down.

780
01:41:48,270 --> 01:41:54,819
How do I leave?

781
01:41:54,819 --> 01:42:00,159
Restart?

782
01:42:00,159 --> 01:42:02,100
Oh, okay.

783
01:42:02,100 --> 01:42:04,050
Start it?

784
01:42:04,050 --> 01:42:05,050
Restart the game.

785
01:42:05,050 --> 01:42:12,750
That button.

786
01:42:12,750 --> 01:42:13,930
Where's that button?

787
01:42:13,930 --> 01:42:20,159
Where do I restart?

788
01:42:20,159 --> 01:42:24,470
Library, store, exit game and then just restart it?

789
01:42:24,470 --> 01:42:26,470
I lost you guys.

790
01:42:26,470 --> 01:42:33,020
What?

791
01:42:33,020 --> 01:42:38,100
Shut it down.

792
01:42:38,100 --> 01:42:39,279
Exit.

793
01:42:39,279 --> 01:42:40,279
Yeah.

794
01:42:40,279 --> 01:42:47,729
Hold on.

795
01:42:47,729 --> 01:42:48,729
Oh, here we go.

796
01:42:48,729 --> 01:42:50,609
Okay.

797
01:42:50,609 --> 01:42:51,609
Just open it back up.

798
01:42:51,609 --> 01:42:56,619
Hey, there we go.

799
01:42:56,619 --> 01:42:57,619
Turn off your PC.

800
01:42:57,619 --> 01:43:03,220
What's wrong with this chat?

801
01:43:03,220 --> 01:43:04,220
What do you mean?

802
01:43:04,220 --> 01:43:05,520
Wait.

803
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:09,640
Launch.

804
01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:17,149
First gamer moment of 2020.

805
01:43:17,149 --> 01:43:18,149
Why?

806
01:43:18,149 --> 01:43:19,149
What do you mean?

807
01:43:19,149 --> 01:43:20,390
What happened?

808
01:43:20,390 --> 01:43:28,159
Yeah.

809
01:43:28,159 --> 01:43:29,159
Relax.

810
01:43:29,159 --> 01:43:30,909
What?

811
01:43:30,909 --> 01:43:31,909
You actually did it, Omega Lowell.

812
01:43:31,909 --> 01:43:32,909
What are you talking about?

813
01:43:32,909 --> 01:43:33,909
What did I do wrong?

814
01:43:33,909 --> 01:43:41,229
Continue.

815
01:43:41,229 --> 01:43:49,260
All right.

816
01:43:49,260 --> 01:43:50,260
Let's try the other ones.

817
01:43:50,260 --> 01:43:51,260
So that was two.

818
01:43:51,260 --> 01:43:52,260
This is three.

819
01:43:52,260 --> 01:43:58,310
I have this weird memory of Five Nights at Freddy's 3 being terrible.

820
01:43:58,310 --> 01:44:03,390
This is the one that sucks, right?

821
01:44:03,390 --> 01:44:04,390
Yes.

822
01:44:04,390 --> 01:44:06,579
Kind of.

823
01:44:06,579 --> 01:44:08,579
Well, you might as well see it.

824
01:44:08,579 --> 01:44:14,289
What's the one where you're in the bedroom and you're like the little kid in the bedroom?

825
01:44:14,289 --> 01:44:20,329
Hey, hey.

826
01:44:20,329 --> 01:44:22,329
Glad you came back for another night.

827
01:44:22,329 --> 01:44:24,529
It'll be a lot better.

828
01:44:24,529 --> 01:44:32,489
What did I do?

829
01:44:32,489 --> 01:44:33,489
That was light.

830
01:44:33,489 --> 01:44:34,489
That was vent.

831
01:44:34,489 --> 01:44:35,489
I pressed that button.

832
01:44:35,489 --> 01:44:36,489
No, no, no.

833
01:44:36,489 --> 01:44:40,350
Hey, man.

834
01:44:40,350 --> 01:44:41,350
Hey, Bart.

835
01:44:41,350 --> 01:44:44,590
Come on into the bus, man.

836
01:44:44,590 --> 01:44:46,729
Totally, man.

837
01:44:46,729 --> 01:45:02,319
I'll get you to school on time.

838
01:45:02,319 --> 01:45:05,319
I like this one because the screen is bigger.

839
01:45:05,319 --> 01:45:22,409
Is there a light I can put in here?

840
01:45:22,409 --> 01:45:31,460
Oh, yeah.

841
01:45:31,460 --> 01:45:32,460
This one sucks.

842
01:45:32,460 --> 01:45:33,460
It's the bunny that...

843
01:45:33,460 --> 01:45:34,460
Yeah, this one's not good.

844
01:45:34,460 --> 01:45:35,460
I don't like this one.

845
01:45:35,460 --> 01:45:36,460
This one sucks.

846
01:45:37,460 --> 01:45:41,529
I played this on iPad and I was like, this game sucks.

847
01:45:41,529 --> 01:46:04,140

848
01:46:04,140 --> 01:46:15,899

851

852
