1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,780
Hello. So, uh, we are exactly on time for the time that I told Ster. Which was 3.30.

2
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:33,359
Oops. Uh, I thought it was 3. Uh, accidentally I said 3.30, and oops-a-daisy, here we are, 3.30 exactly on time.

3
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:40,560
Okay, sorry about that. But hey, you know, I usually start at 6. We're about two and a half hours before earlier than that.

4
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:50,030
Yeah, here we are. How you doing? I'm gonna wait one or two minutes because I have something I want to, very important to talk about.

5
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:58,530
Very, very important grotto beast information that you need to know. I want to make sure it's very clear and I'm gonna make sure you know what's going on.

6
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:25,439
So let's wait a minute. Body sound like a teacher. Get out of here. I played it with my friend and it was fun. That's awesome to hear.

7
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,560
We hope you like it. Like we've said many times.

8
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:40,530
Okay, I'm gonna be playing Orcs Must Die 3 with Ster, who is in the call right now, but we are muted. He's using his teacher voice. Uh-oh.

9
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:49,219
Uh-oh, that's how you know something is actually, this is actually really important though, for real.

10
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:59,969
It is an update on the shipping issue that some of the early orders have been seeing. And I want to make sure people know that what's going on.

11
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:24,900
This guy hates Orcs. So just to give you a little bit of context, the Grotto Beasts project, uh, we had a presale and a lot of people that ordered in that first week, they got an estimated ship date.

12
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:38,180
And I want to, just anybody listening right now, if you have an estimated ship date in March, if you're one of the people with an estimated March ship date and you have not heard anything yet, Represent is going to reach out.

13
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:48,449
Represent is the fulfillment company, by the way. So at some point tomorrow morning, Represent is going to come out with a statement to everybody explaining kind of what happened.

14
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:55,650
And it's unfortunate that we have to do this, but those early orders are going to have to wait a little bit longer.

15
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:05,250
And we're doing, on our end here, every single thing possible to make it so those early orders get fulfilled, but Represent is going to come out with a statement.

16
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:13,259
They're going to explain what happened on their end, and that's pretty much all that we can do from here.

17
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:20,930
But the early orders that still have estimated March shipping dates, they now, they have complete priority.

18
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:29,330
So this is not a case of, oh, shit, I'm going to have to wait till the May estimated shipping date. No.

19
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:42,629
It's a manageable amount of orders that we think working with Represent here on correcting some of these issues that they can actually fulfill these in not that much time.

20
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:53,229
I'm really sorry that it came out like this. This is not, obviously, a lot of orders have already gone out, but Represent is aware of the problem on their end and they're going to figure it out.

21
00:03:53,229 --> 00:03:59,229
And they're going to be sending out, you shouldn't have to do anything. There's probably nothing you have to do.

22
00:03:59,229 --> 00:04:08,620
They're going to reach out as of tomorrow. So that's the thing to talk about.

23
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:15,319
That's the thing I wanted to point to. If you have an estimated March shipping date, keep an eye on your email.

24
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:29,430
They're going to reach out in the next day and they will tell you exactly the issues that they're having.

25
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:34,829
And that's pretty much all I can say. We're really happy with people that have gotten it.

26
00:04:34,829 --> 00:04:37,829
Everyone seems to be excited about it. We're excited about it.

27
00:04:37,829 --> 00:04:41,629
It's people that seem to be having fun. People are getting their orders.

28
00:04:41,629 --> 00:04:48,029
But that doesn't I want to make sure that people that fucking ordered in the first few days get treated better.

29
00:04:48,029 --> 00:04:53,540
And that's exactly what's happening right now. And we're doing it literally the last two weeks.

30
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:58,939
We've been desperately trying to make this problem solved and Represent wants to as well.

31
00:04:58,939 --> 00:05:05,139
So they're going to handle this. If you have a March estimated ship date, please spread this around too.

32
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:09,839
If you know of people that have a March estimated ship date that didn't get any information yet,

33
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:20,889
tell them to keep an eye on their email as of tomorrow. I can't tell if what you're saying is real.

34
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:25,589
This is very real. This is very real. This is not like a routine.

35
00:05:25,589 --> 00:05:33,449
I want to be very upfront and clear about this. But like I said,

36
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:37,550
it's a manageable amount of orders that we can completely expedite it.

37
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:44,279
Everybody that's an early order now has complete priority and it's it's not going to be.

38
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:48,579
Oh, now you have to wait all the way through May like the May estimated ship dates.

39
00:05:48,579 --> 00:05:54,790
That is not happening. I can assure you of that.

40
00:05:54,790 --> 00:06:03,509
But anyways, let's go talk to stir. You have to be corporate Andy.

41
00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:07,209
I mean, I have to. I mean, people that people are spending money on this shit

42
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:11,110
and I want to make sure that we can assure everybody that they're going to get what they ordered.

43
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:14,040
And that's exactly what I'm fucking doing.

44
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,740
You know what I mean? Like people spent money on this shit.

45
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:22,589
I got to be upfront. So we're taking care of it.

46
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:27,120
Shouldn't be that much longer. There'll be a really comprehensive update tomorrow.

47
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:36,959
Check your emails. If you have a March estimated ship date, stir isn't laughing at you.

48
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:43,379
Hey, it's three thirties. Oh, it's three thirty eight.

49
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:50,220
Oops. How the stream needs to progress.

50
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,579
Yeah, I did. I did. I gave stir a schedule.

51
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:58,310
I did. So I assume your apology took a little longer than expected.

52
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:01,529
Is everyone everyone very angry? No.

53
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:05,230
No, it was it was very clear.

54
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:08,529
Oh, you can still hear this. There you go.

55
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:13,449
Yeah. But can you hear this? You fart.

56
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:17,420
No, that's usually when that's usually when you put a fart in.

57
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,720
Just want to make sure you understand.

58
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,829
Making sure everything was working.

59
00:07:23,829 --> 00:07:28,439
All right. So we're playing orcs must die three.

60
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:35,399
Yes. A new orcs must die.

61
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:37,500
You're you're the party leader.

62
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,800
You are the operational manager.

63
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,509
Oh, wait, I am.

64
00:07:41,509 --> 00:07:44,410
Oh, boy. Oh, I'm not leaking like a room code or something, right?

65
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,910
I I have no idea.

66
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:49,310
I didn't even like look at that.

67
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,410
I don't think so. I think we're good.

68
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,310
I think I have to ready.

69
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:57,639
I'm ready. I just want to make sure it wasn't like this and like a friend code.

70
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:00,540
All right. So this is why you want to explain why we're playing orcs must die three.

71
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,240
You said that you were into it. You wanted to check it out.

72
00:08:03,939 --> 00:08:07,240
We're playing orcs must die three because you contacted me and said,

73
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,540
hey, do you want to play a game?

74
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,759
And then I came up with a bunch of ideas.

75
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,560
Five nights at Freddy's ideas weren't very good.

76
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,459
Five nights at Freddy's watch along.

77
00:08:16,459 --> 00:08:20,959
Excuse me. Also my idea now was yours on like a whole other stream.

78
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,959
Excuse me. Credit.

79
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:26,560
Excuse me. You want the five nights at Freddy's watch along.

80
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,259
I don't know. I thought that was your face for a second.

81
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,660
I don't know why I just saw a face on my screen.

82
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,860
I thought it was you.

83
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:49,259
Wait, you want to skip this?

84
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:52,159
No. Oh, what's the lore?

85
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:56,519
I don't know.

86
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:00,419
Don't don't you want to know the lore capabilities?

87
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:14,019
Yeah. A real ogre would have eaten you by now.

88
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:16,419
You will miss that face for a while.

89
00:09:16,419 --> 00:09:18,419
I think he said we've come back.

90
00:09:18,419 --> 00:09:22,919
Wow, it's like you're allergic to saying smarts.

91
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,220
For an ogre?

92
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,419
What the fuck?

93
00:09:25,419 --> 00:09:28,539
Right? Time is over.

94
00:09:28,539 --> 00:09:32,659
I just want to kill some orcs, man.

95
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:34,799
I want to get in there in game, man.

96
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:38,009
All right. Do we have to choose between who you want to be?

97
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:39,970
Wait, do they have different weapons?

98
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:46,299
Do you want the magic longbow or do you want the blunderbuss gun or bow?

99
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:47,000
I want the bow.

100
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,100
I think the bow is the person who has to run around and do things more.

101
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:50,899
Sounds good to me.

102
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:57,690
At least that's how it was in the second one.

103
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:01,120
It's like a YouTube video thumbnail.

104
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,419
Enemies through the rift reduces rift points, right?

105
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:05,360
So don't let them get through.

106
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,799
This is your loadout.

107
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:09,000
And then yeah, blazing trap spends money.

108
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,700
Do we share money?

109
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,600
I don't know.

110
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,500
This is this is world's first.

111
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,809
No one's ever played this game before.

112
00:10:16,809 --> 00:10:18,509
All right. Enemies through the rift.

113
00:10:18,509 --> 00:10:21,009
I think I'm playing at like 720p by the way.

114
00:10:21,009 --> 00:10:22,850
I'm back at the menu.

115
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:23,990
You are?

116
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,289
Yeah, like I'm back at like ready up again.

117
00:10:26,289 --> 00:10:29,259
Oh, okay.

118
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:30,860
Failed to connect.

119
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,230
Trap placement is critical.

120
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:37,820
It's like the trap you want to place and look at the surface.

121
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,919
Are we playing on a split screen?

122
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:41,620
Oh, no.

123
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,519
No, no, I failed to connect.

124
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,100
We're not playing together at all.

125
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,549
Waiting for player to connect.

126
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:51,350
This is waiting for you.

127
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,850
Invite me again or?

128
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:56,250
Maybe we should just redo it.

129
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:56,850
Maybe.

130
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:58,210
Let's redo it.

131
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:01,710
Or maybe we have to do like the tutorial by ourselves.

132
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:04,409
This is waiting for player to connect.

133
00:11:04,409 --> 00:11:06,809
Now, let's try out these traps.

134
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:10,169
Maybe we'll just skip the cutscene this time.

135
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,289
So you're at the menu.

136
00:11:12,289 --> 00:11:12,789
Yeah.

137
00:11:12,789 --> 00:11:12,990
Okay.

138
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:15,289
Let's try this.

139
00:11:15,289 --> 00:11:16,190
Your stream is there.

140
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:16,889
Oh, no, no, no, no.

141
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:19,090
It's I didn't mean to do it.

142
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:19,289
All right.

143
00:11:19,289 --> 00:11:22,250
It says waiting for player.

144
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,549
Can you invite me again?

145
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:25,049
I guess I'm a pal.

146
00:11:25,049 --> 00:11:26,850
See this steam is down.

147
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:27,549
Is it is it?

148
00:11:27,549 --> 00:11:29,649
Wait steam is down.

149
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:31,049
Oh, come on, man.

150
00:11:31,049 --> 00:11:38,659
What where we started?

151
00:11:38,659 --> 00:11:40,059
What day is it today?

152
00:11:40,059 --> 00:11:40,759
It's Wednesday.

153
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:49,440
I thought it was Tuesday.

154
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,919
That's so funny.

155
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:59,139
Well, I guess we could do the tutorial.

156
00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:01,440
Wait, let me make sure my game is.

157
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,279
That's so funny that that happened right when we connected into a game.

158
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:07,779
That makes me very upset.

159
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:14,450
Somebody was just sitting there waiting to press the button.

160
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:14,750
All right.

161
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:22,779
Am I what what frame what graphics quality?

162
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:26,629
I think it's good.

163
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:28,200
Good.

164
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,700
So you guys just need to play Roblox instead.

165
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,029
I don't think I could convince her to play Roblox.

166
00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:37,429
That would take an unbelievable amount of convincing.

167
00:12:37,429 --> 00:12:39,500
But we already did.

168
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,360
Yeah, but a second time.

169
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,529
Didn't we do everything there was to do?

170
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:50,429
Didn't we play literally every game mode?

171
00:12:50,429 --> 00:12:52,600
Hmm.

172
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,299
Yeah.

173
00:12:53,299 --> 00:12:55,100
People saying Five Nights at Freddy's watch along.

174
00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:00,399
But the plan was I was going to raid stir and stay in the call so I could get it in real time.

175
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,200
So we're not we're not quite ready for that.

176
00:13:02,299 --> 00:13:06,200
I would just I would have just turned my stream on to make a grotto be shipping update

177
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,360
and then raid you.

178
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,259
So that's is that the stream?

179
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:11,559
Welcome to the corporate stream.

180
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:13,139
Is that what we're doing today?

181
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:15,799
No, we're playing orcs must die.

182
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:18,399
Maintenance only takes like 30 seconds, right?

183
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:26,740
Sometimes it takes like 30 minutes.

184
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:30,120
And you're the one who wanted to start this early.

185
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:30,519
What?

186
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:34,250
No, that's not true.

187
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:40,059
You you're the early Andy.

188
00:13:40,059 --> 00:13:42,259
I started 6 p.m.

189
00:13:42,259 --> 00:13:45,610
Pacific.

190
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:47,110
Let's do a podcast.

191
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,580
All right.

192
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,580
I mean, let's meet.

193
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:49,980
Let's do a little.

194
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:53,580
I mean, I have a long questionnaire for you.

195
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:56,580
I've been waiting for your judgment on a very particular situation.

196
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,279
Okay.

197
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,840
But what do you want from me?

198
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,340
You're going to have to stay with me the whole time because I feel like as I'm starting to explain this,

199
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,340
you're going to cut me off.

200
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:10,480
But I really want you to be the judge and and and like arbitrate the situation.

201
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:10,779
Okay.

202
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:11,879
Are you down?

203
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:14,279
No, but I think you're going to ask it anyways.

204
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:14,580
Okay.

205
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:17,980
You are you're like a judge in a court.

206
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:23,379
It is it is your decision to like figure out if I'm guilty or not.

207
00:14:23,379 --> 00:14:28,269
I as an individual, I knew that there was a police sting operation going on,

208
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:31,970
you know, where they like be like the guy walks in the room and like buys prostitution.

209
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:32,269
Okay.

210
00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:35,870
And the cops jump in the moment you like hand over the money and there's an exchange.

211
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:36,970
They run there.

212
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:38,570
You're arrested and they take you away.

213
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:39,370
Okay.

214
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:39,570
Okay.

215
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:49,490
So I come in there knowing that it's a sting operation because I'm trying to I'm trying to get one over on the police.

216
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:50,990
I do the whole thing.

217
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,990
I hand over the money.

218
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:58,429
But as it's revealed later, I have no genitals.

219
00:14:58,429 --> 00:15:00,289
So I end up in court.

220
00:15:00,289 --> 00:15:01,590
Am I guilty of a crime?

221
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:04,889
If I'm like, oh, hey, babe, why don't you knock on my wood?

222
00:15:04,889 --> 00:15:07,289
And then I don't even have any genitals.

223
00:15:07,289 --> 00:15:08,789
I'm completely smooth.

224
00:15:08,789 --> 00:15:09,289
You're the judge.

225
00:15:09,289 --> 00:15:19,320
What do you say what what because the crime is is purchasing prostitution,

226
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:25,570
but I can't I can't but I'm giving her money for something that I don't have.

227
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:28,779
Well, hold on there though.

228
00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:30,480
You you are the exchange.

229
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:42,269
The exchange has happened and you're you're exchanging for I'm being I would ask her for something very specifically requiring the having genitals part.

230
00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:47,269
I'm just being nice and not going into explicit detail because I know there's a lot of like six-year-olds here.

231
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:52,740
But all right, but but okay, but your intent was not oh come over and like play cards.

232
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:55,340
Your intent was in a sexual nature.

233
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:58,210
Is that incorrect?

234
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:00,289
Yeah.

235
00:16:00,289 --> 00:16:03,039
But I can't.

236
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:06,399
I'm a smoothie.

237
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,039
Okay.

238
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:09,539
Well, I'm not I'm not a judge.

239
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:11,639
So I don't think I can give you an answer here.

240
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:15,399
But I wonder if intent would be a case here.

241
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:16,100
I have no idea.

242
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,049
I'm not a fucking lawyer.

243
00:16:19,049 --> 00:16:20,049
I thought you went to law school.

244
00:16:20,049 --> 00:16:25,950
Disturbered.

245
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:26,950
I've been wondering about that for a while.

246
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:27,750
I don't know.

247
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,250
I don't know what the answer to that question is.

248
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:34,120
Well, if the answer is no, then could you countersue?

249
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,019
Who is countersuing you?

250
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:40,620
No, I'm countersuing because you get brought to court and like you get arrested for like something like a crime.

251
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:46,700
You didn't commit.

252
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,100
What's your diet like the last few months?

253
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,000
My diet?

254
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,700
Yeah, are you getting enough like B vitamins?

255
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,899
I started I started doing fasting again.

256
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:57,799
I'm on attempt number two, two meal a day.

257
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:59,299
You're getting like all your B vitamins, right?

258
00:16:59,299 --> 00:17:00,200
And like vitamin like C and E.

259
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:05,730
No, no, I'm I'm eating like nothing.

260
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:06,029
Okay.

261
00:17:06,029 --> 00:17:10,130
Like literally I haven't eaten anything in like two weeks.

262
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,029
You should probably consume some food.

263
00:17:12,029 --> 00:17:15,730
I would recommend a nice balanced salad with maybe some lean protein.

264
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:16,829
Maybe a turkey.

265
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:18,029
Maybe some fish on it or something.

266
00:17:18,029 --> 00:17:23,720
Well, not on the salad, but you know in general, do you eat breakfast?

267
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,220
No.

268
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,599
Start doing that.

269
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:28,900
Is that what you think this is?

270
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,900
How much?

271
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,599
You're the judge.

272
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:34,299
I come into court and you're like eating breakfast kid.

273
00:17:34,299 --> 00:17:36,299
How much breakfast are you eating?

274
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:40,730
Are you getting like a bunch of whole grains because they're necessary?

275
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:43,180
No.

276
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,480
What about sunshine?

277
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,880
Are you out of the house?

278
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,279
At least you are.

279
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:53,029
I got a blood test and my doctor was like you need to take vitamin D.

280
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:58,730
And then I did and then she's like, okay, take less vitamin D.

281
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:08,519
Yeah, I would say going outside even for five minutes just to let the sun hit you in the face for five minutes is something everybody should be doing.

282
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:10,490
I do I go outside.

283
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:10,789
Okay.

284
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:15,970
So yeah, I've ruled go outside and eat guess it will be vitamins.

285
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:16,670
That's what I'm okay.

286
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:19,480
So I don't go to prison.

287
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:28,440

288
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:28,640

Oh, no, you're gonna have to like talk unfiltered for more than 10 minutes.

293
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,759
I'll be unfiltered.

00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:33,680
I did this I walked in here and I sat down and I heard I was rushing because I thought

339
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,930
you would make being weird.

340
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:36,630
They wait.

341
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,130
I wasn't I mute it.

342
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:41,430
Yeah, but I don't know you're I don't want you to be weird on your stream either.

343
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:45,730
Oh, yeah, and like like do another jump scare on your stream somehow.

344
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:45,930
All right.

345
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:46,329
Here we go.

346
00:21:46,329 --> 00:21:48,369
You ready?

347
00:21:48,369 --> 00:21:52,039
Are you ready to see one of the creatures?

348
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:59,809
I'm ready.

349
00:21:59,809 --> 00:22:00,809
I broke him.

350
00:22:01,309 --> 00:22:03,009
He's not supposed to look like this.

351
00:22:03,009 --> 00:22:05,289
He's not supposed to look like this.

352
00:22:05,289 --> 00:22:08,430
Hold on it.

353
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:16,920
I have 160 he had wings and I accidentally ripped him off.

354
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,200
He's like a I don't know.

355
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,869
What the hell is that?

356
00:22:21,869 --> 00:22:22,970
It's not a creature.

357
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:25,769
It's not painted yet and it's not even fully sculpted.

358
00:22:25,769 --> 00:22:28,650
They didn't even see the texture.

359
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:31,480
You didn't even see the texture.

360
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:37,569
This is just a prototype.

361
00:22:37,569 --> 00:22:41,339
It's a prototype.

362
00:22:41,339 --> 00:22:43,930
It looks like Jar Jar Binks.

363
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:48,460
What doesn't you look very happy in the picture.

364
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,160
I took to show my stream.

365
00:22:50,259 --> 00:22:53,859
I've never seen you smile this much or have this much joy.

366
00:22:53,859 --> 00:22:57,329
So I'm glad you found a hobby that really works for you.

367
00:22:57,329 --> 00:22:59,019
What's his name?

368
00:22:59,019 --> 00:23:02,150
I didn't well, I can't name him until I put the wings back on.

369
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:05,700
I accidentally ripped his legs off too.

370
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,299
Oh wait, there's another let me get another one.

371
00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:07,599
This one.

372
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:07,900
This one.

373
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:08,900
This was just a prototype.

374
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,210
Hold on.

375
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:22,009
There's more.

376
00:23:22,009 --> 00:23:22,910
Oh, hey guys.

377
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:25,410
Did he leave me unmuted when he walked away?

378
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:30,180
I'm going to tell you about my giblets.

379
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:37,680
Okay, he did.

380
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,279
I am over.

381
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:44,289
I just dream with anyone else where he's like I need to be like

382
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:47,390
I need to show caution when he plays with like Vinny.

383
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:49,789
Is it like oh dude like I am I'm going to get up.

384
00:23:49,789 --> 00:23:59,180
I can't I can't let him like talk to my chat.

385
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,180
What is he saying?

386
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,160
What's he doing?

387
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,059
Stop stop it.

388
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:04,160
Stop it.

389
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:04,759
What ready?

390
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:05,859
Let me show some more.

391
00:24:05,859 --> 00:24:06,859
I'm ready.

392
00:24:06,859 --> 00:24:07,960
This was the all right.

393
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,720
Let me show this.

394
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:17,839
This is like a kind of like a ghost or something.

395
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:21,160
Do you like it?

396
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:27,029
So what is a ghost that one doesn't look like anything is it is

397
00:24:27,029 --> 00:24:32,079
like they see that it's a mouth you see it look there's a side

398
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:32,480
profile.

399
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:38,079
He's going I I like the other one.

400
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:41,369
I can't I I can't understand this one.

401
00:24:41,369 --> 00:24:42,470
You can't see this.

402
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:44,970
Oh, I I kind of see it now.

403
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:49,849
Okay.

404
00:24:49,849 --> 00:24:53,470
What about making beehives?

405
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:59,269
I might make some bees the golf ball, dude.

406
00:24:59,269 --> 00:25:01,569
Shut up.

407
00:25:01,569 --> 00:25:03,869
I'm a golf ball.

408
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:08,380
This is the start of a kind of a half rhinoceros half-elephant

409
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:13,339
creature started his head.

410
00:25:13,339 --> 00:25:27,539
Why am I taking he's going like this is a.

411
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:30,839
The start of a kind of like a bird like a weird like duck or

412
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:31,240
something.

413
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,880
This is his mouth.

414
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:40,900
I'm going to put big eyes on top and he's going like, okay,

415
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:44,299
that one that one also doesn't it's like very nice shapes

416
00:25:44,299 --> 00:25:46,599
and contours, but doesn't look like a bird.

417
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:47,799
It's not done looking anything.

418
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:48,700
This is the head.

419
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,799
This is literally the face.

420
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,099
I made the face like the head.

421
00:25:51,099 --> 00:25:53,200
Do you have like a kiln in your house?

422
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,960
No, this is this this stuff is this air dry.

423
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:04,029
Some of this is air dry or what some of it's not you didn't

424
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:05,130
say how can you can't see the ghost?

425
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:09,640
Yeah, you can.

426
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,440
It's just not close enough.

427
00:26:13,609 --> 00:26:14,710
I just like burp with the mic.

428
00:26:16,829 --> 00:26:19,029
What were those things that growing up as kids where you

429
00:26:19,029 --> 00:26:22,400
like threw them on the ground and they were all they were

430
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,900
all like monsters like that.

431
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:25,599
There's a whole game for it.

432
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,799
It's kind of like pogs, but there was like little creature

433
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:31,299
figures or something.

434
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,500
This could be a pineapple.

435
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:33,200
I don't know.

436
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,470
I don't remember this could be a pineapple and sometimes hey

437
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:41,180
those of you artists out there sometimes you start with an

438
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:44,910
idea crazy and it can turn it can turn into something else

439
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,420
do a creature sculpting stream.

440
00:26:50,089 --> 00:26:52,349
Only if sir does it with me a crew.

441
00:26:52,349 --> 00:26:53,549
I'll do it with you a hundred percent.

442
00:26:53,549 --> 00:26:54,950
I just I actually don't want to do with you.

443
00:26:55,349 --> 00:26:56,250
Okay, probably do that.

444
00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:59,549
I mean, I'm kind of artistic and I could I could probably

445
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:02,819
meet you halfway on that.

446
00:27:02,819 --> 00:27:04,819
Would you actually want to like you want to do like a

447
00:27:04,819 --> 00:27:05,920
creature craft off?

448
00:27:06,589 --> 00:27:11,720
Yeah, I mean I got a little bit of experience on you, man.

449
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,440
I mean, I'll make something that looks like something you

450
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,440
either do.

451
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:18,140
Okay.

452
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:22,440
Hold on crazy crazy bone crafting session.

453
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,079
Hold on a second.

454
00:27:25,869 --> 00:27:27,769
You think you're going to do better than the rhinoceros

455
00:27:27,769 --> 00:27:28,170
elephant?

456
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:33,660
I mean artists objective and beauty is in the eye of the

457
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:37,259
beholder, but I think I think I can beat that.

458
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,079
Okay, he's cute.

459
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,079
That one.

460
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,980
I like that one a lot more than the ghost say you didn't

461
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,980
even give it a chance and it's not even done.

462
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:50,430
Can you see the texturing that I did?

463
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,430
Have you painted any of them?

464
00:27:55,529 --> 00:27:56,430
Hard to see the texture.

465
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:00,549
Oh, yeah.

466
00:28:00,849 --> 00:28:04,049
Yeah, I sat there and individually put little like little

467
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:05,450
bubbles on all over him.

468
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:11,089
There's this more too, but kind of just hard types.

469
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,490
This sounds this is great.

470
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:15,690
This sounds like this is being on the toilet for you, but

471
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:23,019
like without being in the bathroom like it's relaxing.

472
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,019
You can just take your time with your craft.

473
00:28:25,019 --> 00:28:27,940
You don't have to like you don't have to be on the

474
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,440
toilet.

475
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:39,759
But why do I have to what would you but why does what

476
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:40,359
does that matter?

477
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,259
Wait, say everything you just said one more time.

478
00:28:42,259 --> 00:28:43,059
We're playing Elden Ring.

479
00:28:43,059 --> 00:28:45,160
You were saying that like your most relaxed time is

480
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,859
when you're on there's nothing else to do.

481
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:48,359
You're in the bathroom 45.

482
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:52,140
None of those Ember your 45 minutes on the toilet 985.

483
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:52,839
Oh, no, for sure.

484
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:53,140
Yeah.

485
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,039
Okay.

486
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:58,059
Well, this is like this is like pooping but it has like

487
00:28:58,059 --> 00:29:00,250
a better outcome.

488
00:29:00,349 --> 00:29:02,349
I'm going to do so much crazy stuff to I'm going to like

489
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:03,819
I don't know.

490
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,519
I'm just saying it.

491
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:07,599
You know, I'm one of those people that makes like 15

492
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:11,150
different heads of various shapes and then you're going

493
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:11,849
to go any bigger.

494
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,049
I want to get a little original.

495
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:16,150
I want a German original signed.

496
00:29:16,349 --> 00:29:17,650
I'm going to put it in a vault.

497
00:29:19,339 --> 00:29:21,440
I want to make like a big building and have like a

498
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,240
bunch of these like weird creatures is hanging out in

499
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:23,640
front of it.

500
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:31,630
But if you want it you want to put it in the vault you

501
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:31,930
can.

502
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,559
Hold on this comment.

503
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,640
So I'm saying I'm ignoring ignoring I ignored you

504
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:42,440
someone in your chat said stir remembers what Jerma

505
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,440
says and it's awkward bringing it up because you

506
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,339
don't know.

507
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:50,109
Like what is he talking about the bathroom?

508
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,839
I just I sometimes like audio comes in this way and

509
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:58,339
then just like goes out that way and it's just it's

510
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:02,799
just gone and I it depends or sometimes I'll just

511
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:05,299
talk and let me okay.

512
00:30:05,299 --> 00:30:06,799
Let me ask you a question mister.

513
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:07,700
Let me get this on you.

514
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,440
So you asked me a question in court.

515
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:12,440
I'm asking you a question in court now.

516
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:18,319
How many words do you think you have said recorded

517
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:24,640
what why is this being brought before a judge

518
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:27,740
because the reason why I get system the reason why

519
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,640
I have so much time remembering things is because

520
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:34,099
I feel like I I say so many things every day and

521
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:37,200
I'm recording so much like like 90% of it is you

522
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,099
can just throw it out.

523
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,599
No, it's just like it's like millions and millions

524
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:43,000
of sentences over like 15 years to 12 years,

525
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,799
whatever it's been on like YouTube and Twitch and

526
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:45,099
stuff.

527
00:30:48,009 --> 00:30:50,410
No, no, I mean like on a grand scale.

528
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:52,410
I agree that I forget most of the things I say on

529
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:54,210
stream even when people bring it up like two days

530
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:55,809
late and that's the judgment right there.

531
00:30:55,809 --> 00:30:56,509
Thank you very much.

532
00:30:56,509 --> 00:31:00,519
You can go home now but like things that like

533
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:03,720
someone says to me or that I say to someone like

534
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,319
conversations with like a real human.

535
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:07,019
I'll remember that because you know, like I respect

536
00:31:07,019 --> 00:31:10,420
you and well, I remember about major things that

537
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,819
I talked but like just random just stuff that we

538
00:31:12,819 --> 00:31:14,619
just bring up on a regular kind of daily basis

539
00:31:14,619 --> 00:31:17,029
sometimes just gone and I feel like shitting for

540
00:31:17,029 --> 00:31:19,130
45 minutes a major part of your life.

541
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:20,829
Well, I know I knew that what I'm talking about

542
00:31:20,829 --> 00:31:23,529
but you but you but I knew that I did that I know

543
00:31:23,529 --> 00:31:25,930
that I use the bathroom for a long period but you

544
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:29,130
were equating it to like crafting creatures and

545
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:31,720
I was sitting there for a second going it's not

546
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,920
I had to connect that first.

547
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,019
Well, like wasn't this recently to that like you

548
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:39,019
had like your family was in town or something you

549
00:31:39,019 --> 00:31:40,720
went out for like a big fancy dinner like everyone

550
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,619
got all dressed up and you got up to go to the

551
00:31:42,619 --> 00:31:44,720
bathroom and you were gone just like the whole

552
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,019
night.

553
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:50,809
No, yeah, like before you went to the bathroom you

554
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:52,809
like dug in your backpack that you brought like

555
00:31:52,809 --> 00:31:54,410
you're in a you're like a suit in a nice restaurant

556
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:56,009
you dug in your backpack and had all your toys

557
00:31:56,009 --> 00:31:57,710
and stuff to like keep you entertained you picked

558
00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:00,609
out an iPad and you were just gone for two hours

559
00:32:00,609 --> 00:32:01,309
in the bathroom.

560
00:32:02,789 --> 00:32:05,589
No, this this is this is not a real I don't know

561
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:08,789
there was a squeaky toy in it to it like everything

562
00:32:08,789 --> 00:32:11,690
you could possibly need for a moment really like

563
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:12,990
I'm going to get bored at dinner.

564
00:32:13,589 --> 00:32:18,799
You told me that you were not going to bring up

565
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:23,869
the squeaky toys that I like to have you I'm going

566
00:32:23,869 --> 00:32:26,769
to talk to you off stream about this because I

567
00:32:27,069 --> 00:32:28,869
my backpack of squeaky toys is something that you

568
00:32:28,869 --> 00:32:30,369
said we weren't going to be discussing ever.

569
00:32:30,369 --> 00:32:35,849
But now we're going to it seemed like appropriate

570
00:32:35,849 --> 00:32:38,150
to bring up considering you were pretending to not

571
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:40,950
remember you're looking kind of big by the way.

572
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:41,650
What do you mean?

573
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:44,940
No fuck off.

574
00:32:46,099 --> 00:32:46,700
Are you serious?

575
00:32:48,579 --> 00:32:50,279
Well, have you been making your webcam bigger?

576
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,599
I mean it's bigger than yours.

577
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:53,970
Are you fucking kidding me?

578
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:55,869
I'm making sure no, it's not going to be like that.

579
00:32:57,759 --> 00:32:58,960
Is it webcam bigger?

580
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:03,480
Well, like I'm trying to like react to what you're

581
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,380
doing and you're like I should be the prominent

582
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:09,579
focus of the fucking what's going on.

583
00:33:09,579 --> 00:33:10,380
I don't think so.

584
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,579
I just trying to make sure that I have my webcam is

585
00:33:12,579 --> 00:33:13,180
bigger than yours.

586
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,359
I thought you were doing a small webcam.

587
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:17,460
That's I just want to make sure I was bigger than

588
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:17,660
it.

589
00:33:19,619 --> 00:33:21,019
Steam up steam is up.

590
00:33:23,539 --> 00:33:25,740
Imagine sitting on the imagine you go into the bathroom

591
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,640
and somebody's playing with dog toys.

592
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:30,000
Well, you wouldn't see him.

593
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,500
You just hear like squeaking coming from like one

594
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,099
of the stalls like childlike laughter.

595
00:33:37,079 --> 00:33:37,980
All right, let's go for it.

596
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:38,980
Hey, that was kind of fun.

597
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:39,980
That was cool.

598
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,079
Yeah.

599
00:33:41,079 --> 00:33:42,980
Well, I started a new hobby recently.

600
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:44,680
Let's play let's play work.

601
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,519
Most I did you wait.

602
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:49,380
What are you?

603
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,480
Is this a mine's not mine's not like cool.

604
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:52,420
Who cares?

605
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,019
It's probably cool.

606
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:54,420
New hobbies are always interesting.

607
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:55,119
What are you talking about?

608
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:58,599
I started I bought some roller blades.

609
00:34:00,529 --> 00:34:01,329
How is that not cool?

610
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,759
Is that is that cool or not?

611
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:04,059
Cool.

612
00:34:04,059 --> 00:34:06,559
I feel like roller blades are the most not cool thing

613
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:07,160
you can wear.

614
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:08,789
No, I don't think so.

615
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:12,460
It's like a fun outdoor activity where you're going

616
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,659
to take like a little bit of a skill.

617
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:15,650
Yes, I've been outside.

618
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:16,849
I think a lot of your ass.

619
00:34:20,369 --> 00:34:21,070
No, that's cool.

620
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:24,170
I do not ever doubt something that you're doing.

621
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:26,670
And if it's like cool or not, do you want to do it?

622
00:34:28,809 --> 00:34:32,710
Yeah, then it's then it's cool.

623
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:34,710
You understand?

624
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:35,909
Yeah.

625
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:39,429
Okay, I think we can play.

626
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:44,130
I'm ready.

627
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,179
Oh, there's no audio home.

628
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,000
Do we have audio?

629
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,000
Yes.

630
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,400
Yeah.

631
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:53,699
All right.

632
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:58,380
We do we need to see this these children born with the

633
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:58,679
ability.

634
00:34:58,679 --> 00:34:59,280
We saw this already.

635
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,079
Rift magic.

636
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,079
We saw skip skip how powerful he was.

637
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:05,920
All right.

638
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,519
So orcs must die three.

639
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:16,139
They say this is the third in the series, but it's actually

640
00:35:16,139 --> 00:35:18,739
the fourth or the fifth or maybe even the sixth.

641
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,599
We turn this up.

642
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,800
That rift is different.

643
00:35:24,099 --> 00:35:26,900
Quickly get trapped placed and stay on the move.

644
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,800
Okay, so we have you want help with the basics.

645
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:30,699
How do we hear her?

646
00:35:30,699 --> 00:35:32,199
Is what it's asking me to ask you that?

647
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,699
Yeah, I think it's just give me like a quick rundown.

648
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Let's try out these traps for real.

649
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,599
Okay, roll over enemies or gear to learn more.

650
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,300
Okay.

651
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,170
I think it just works like all the other ones, right?

652
00:35:45,489 --> 00:35:45,889
Yeah.

653
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:47,590
I wonder if we share currency though.

654
00:35:50,989 --> 00:35:51,289
Yeah.

655
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,559
Okay, back to back to basics.

656
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,719
Okay, so I've got the spike wall and the spike ground.

657
00:36:00,019 --> 00:36:01,019
On my loadout right now.

658
00:36:01,019 --> 00:36:01,920
I think that's all we can use.

659
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,219
All right.

660
00:36:02,219 --> 00:36:03,719
Oh, I can use the bow too.

661
00:36:04,019 --> 00:36:06,820
We got like a whole inventory to buy stuff.

662
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,920
There's someone talking to me.

663
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:10,360
All right.

664
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,360
Do you have 1400 or do we share?

665
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:13,659
I have 2000.

666
00:36:13,659 --> 00:36:14,659
Okay, so we don't share.

667
00:36:14,659 --> 00:36:18,320
I'm going to put two here on the mini map.

668
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,590
I can see where you are and then I'm going to go one right

669
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:26,679
down the middle here and then one right down the middle there

670
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,139
and I'm out of money.

671
00:36:28,139 --> 00:36:28,539
Good luck.

672
00:36:28,539 --> 00:36:28,840
It's up.

673
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:29,440
It's up to you.

674
00:36:30,409 --> 00:36:32,210
Okay, I'm doing spike walls.

675
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,059
The hordes coming when you press G.

676
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,059
Oh, so we okay.

677
00:36:36,059 --> 00:36:37,159
I went out on like a time limit.

678
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:40,730
Is there a reload?

679
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:41,030
No.

680
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:42,150
All right.

681
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:42,750
Let's just do it.

682
00:36:45,409 --> 00:36:48,610
There's like a slow moving projectile and a fast moving

683
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:49,309
projectile.

684
00:36:53,829 --> 00:36:56,429
Enemies are preparing to breach one of our gates.

685
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:58,530
They've broken through a gate.

686
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,280
Good.

687
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:10,750
Oh, it's mouse scroll to it's easy to switch that way.

688
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:12,840
Now it's too loud.

689
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,940
I'll fix it in like an hour.

690
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:20,170
I wonder if you can pull aggro and make them walk over it

691
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:20,469
too.

692
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:24,949
Why are you not talking?

693
00:37:25,949 --> 00:37:27,650
My game FPS is really low.

694
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:28,150
I'm sorry.

695
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:28,650
I'm sorry.

696
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:29,349
I'm sorry.

697
00:37:29,349 --> 00:37:31,349
I know that like in the play-by-play the minute-by-minute

698
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:32,550
I was supposed to make a joke right now.

699
00:37:34,489 --> 00:37:35,090
I'm sorry.

700
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:41,739
More enemies all the way.

701
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,739
Do you forgive me?

702
00:37:43,579 --> 00:37:44,179
Yeah, I do.

703
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:47,380
Okay, I'm going to fill this up.

704
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:51,730
So what up?

705
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:54,099
Oh, yeah.

706
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,500
Yeah, well, it's the tutorial, you know, it'll be fine.

707
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:05,690
We just said roller skating is not cool.

708
00:38:07,469 --> 00:38:10,269
I was watching a whole video about how not cool

709
00:38:10,269 --> 00:38:15,699
roller skating is on the break.

710
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,019
Nice job.

711
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:23,250
I'm curious actually because a lot of the like roller skating

712
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:26,449
isn't cool is like very much like a 90s thing.

713
00:38:26,849 --> 00:38:30,449
We're like where all the extreme sports were popular.

714
00:38:30,449 --> 00:38:32,750
So like if someone missed out on the 90s because they were

715
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:35,750
just like in a black void before being born, but I think

716
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:40,050
it's roller skating on roller skating would be given they

717
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:42,949
didn't get the whole like smear campaign that skateboarding

718
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:44,150
put on roller skates.

719
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:47,449
Well, there's a roller blading and roller skating, right?

720
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:51,050
I mean, they're basically the same, but are you talking

721
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:54,550
about the four kind of the two and then two two in the

722
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:56,750
front and two in the back or you mean like the blade like

723
00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:00,050
roller blade in line skates there in in line.

724
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:10,349
Okay, so like yeah, so we're talking about in line skating

725
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:13,150
and yeah, that's I think that is pretty synonymous with

726
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,349
being cool.

727
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:15,449
I think you're fine.

728
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,440
I gotta be cool and even if it was roller skates.

729
00:39:22,469 --> 00:39:25,269
I think I think they're making a comeback roller skates.

730
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:29,269
There's a whole bunch of like weird roller derby things

731
00:39:29,269 --> 00:39:30,269
that are like guys.

732
00:39:30,269 --> 00:39:32,570
Let's go fucking let's derby it up.

733
00:39:32,769 --> 00:39:35,469
Is that something you're are you into the idea of kind of

734
00:39:35,469 --> 00:39:37,269
doing like a roller derby thing?

735
00:39:37,369 --> 00:39:40,989
No, no, I'm not.

736
00:39:41,289 --> 00:39:44,289
Okay, but I know I know that it's like I've seen more

737
00:39:44,289 --> 00:39:47,659
and more of it and certainly Austin has a lot of weird

738
00:39:47,659 --> 00:39:48,460
stuff like that.

739
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,000
Vegas probably has a lot of it.

740
00:39:51,099 --> 00:39:51,400
I don't know.

741
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,000
There's a lot of like weird hobbies.

742
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:59,489
Yeah, I would imagine I bet there is I think you need

743
00:39:59,489 --> 00:40:06,429
to unleash the horde and doing it a good thing.

744
00:40:06,429 --> 00:40:07,630
We're on like baby mode.

745
00:40:08,369 --> 00:40:10,070
We're on the I don't think we can even select a higher

746
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:10,570
difficulty.

747
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:11,670
I just did the regular one.

748
00:40:18,289 --> 00:40:22,389
But imagine how badass you'd look pulling up to Jerma's

749
00:40:22,389 --> 00:40:26,559
house and skidding to a stop and roller blades seriously

750
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:27,360
badass.

751
00:40:29,869 --> 00:40:34,269
I'm imagining you doing that and then you go like whoa.

752
00:40:34,269 --> 00:40:35,969
All right, dude, let's go get something to eat and I'm

753
00:40:35,969 --> 00:40:38,170
like hold up and I have to take my skates off for 40

754
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:38,570
minutes.

755
00:40:39,269 --> 00:40:43,269
I'm imagining you doing the big like going super fast

756
00:40:43,269 --> 00:40:46,170
and doing the thing where you go inside and I kind of

757
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:47,869
do the kind of spin out thing.

758
00:40:48,469 --> 00:40:50,469
Yeah, but you were going a little too fast and you have

759
00:40:50,469 --> 00:40:53,170
to do like the run in place kind of thing while you're

760
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:55,269
falling and you fall fall fall fall running running

761
00:40:55,269 --> 00:40:57,269
running and then you go right to the grass.

762
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:04,110
Okay, but what if I like didn't fall and then I just

763
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:04,909
closed the door?

764
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:09,809
You're sending some mixed messages.

765
00:41:09,809 --> 00:41:10,309
Is it cool?

766
00:41:10,309 --> 00:41:11,210
Or is it not cool?

767
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:13,710
That is like super mixed message.

768
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:15,289
No, it is cool.

769
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:28,139
Wait upgrades upgrades, dude.

770
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:33,280
Yeah, I think you get to like buy new things.

771
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:38,860
Oh and like, yeah my your weapon might have a way to

772
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:39,760
unlock the next year.

773
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,760
I have to get 50 headshots with my bow.

774
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:47,380
Oh, we should probably figure this out then because we

775
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,780
don't want to upgrade the same stuff.

776
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:57,360
I'm upgrading my bow or just upgrades complete milestones

777
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,760
to unlock a unique upgrade.

778
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:03,880
Okay, blade staff.

779
00:42:06,179 --> 00:42:14,050
I kind of like this kind of confused reduce mana cost.

780
00:42:16,699 --> 00:42:17,800
I just I went all in on this.

781
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,800
I don't know if that's stupid idea.

782
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,099
It seems like everything has its own amount upgrade

783
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:23,199
points.

784
00:42:25,659 --> 00:42:27,960
I used everything on my bow and I still had more for

785
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:28,659
the other traps.

786
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:32,719
I went all in on the weapon.

787
00:42:33,849 --> 00:42:34,250
Okay.

788
00:42:37,329 --> 00:42:40,550
I mean, yeah, I skipped the tutorial was that's the

789
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:41,250
worst weapon.

790
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:41,750
That's all right.

791
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:50,510
What's your favorite kind of meat?

792
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:54,400
Harami skirt steak.

793
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:57,099
I like brisket.

794
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,199
Brisket is good.

795
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,500
On that note, I have a good question.

796
00:43:04,699 --> 00:43:08,500
If you could have the animalistic trait from one

797
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,599
animal, what would it be?

798
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:20,429
That's interesting.

799
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:24,090
I mean, the easiest thing is say lion because you'd

800
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:26,289
be super strong and fast, but I don't know I maybe

801
00:43:26,289 --> 00:43:27,090
like chimpanzee.

802
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:28,289
I got a good one.

803
00:43:29,179 --> 00:43:30,579
I was thinking about this long and hard and I have

804
00:43:30,579 --> 00:43:31,280
a really good one.

805
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:38,650
The male anglerfish explain specifically they attached

806
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:43,090
to a female anglerfish and they just sort of become

807
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:44,090
part of their body.

808
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:48,400
They sort of like meld into the female and they're

809
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,389
almost like a parasite because at a certain point

810
00:43:51,389 --> 00:43:53,389
they just sort of like absorb into their body.

811
00:43:58,289 --> 00:44:00,289
Well, I'd be a chimpanzee because they can like jump

812
00:44:00,289 --> 00:44:03,690
around fast and they're like very noble.

813
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:05,989
They're very noble.

814
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:09,590
No chimpanzees like known for ripping people's

815
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:10,389
faces off.

816
00:44:11,289 --> 00:44:12,190
Very noble.

817
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:15,489
What's the most noble animal do you think?

818
00:44:15,489 --> 00:44:16,789
We didn't even put traps down.

819
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:19,090
It took two seconds.

820
00:44:21,869 --> 00:44:26,809
The most noble animal noble as in like born to a

821
00:44:26,809 --> 00:44:31,690
noble family or like, I don't know.

822
00:44:32,389 --> 00:44:32,989
Elephant.

823
00:44:35,269 --> 00:44:35,570
Okay.

824
00:44:38,849 --> 00:44:39,550
Oh, he just went.

825
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,280
I screwed that up.

826
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:44,280
Oh, there's another door.

827
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:48,809
Oh, no one was coming out of it yet.

828
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:50,809
It's just you want me to focus on this one.

829
00:44:51,409 --> 00:44:56,579
Yeah, I'm so bad at this.

830
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,679
Hey be nice to yourself, you know, that's true.

831
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:02,280
That's right.

832
00:45:03,219 --> 00:45:04,920
You're a lot better at this than you are at sculpting.

833
00:45:20,869 --> 00:45:21,170
We do it.

834
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:27,710
Okay over there enjoy your roller skating.

835
00:45:29,650 --> 00:45:34,039
I mean as long as you enjoy it, but you made a

836
00:45:34,039 --> 00:45:34,739
competitive.

837
00:45:35,639 --> 00:45:38,679
That was you when you said that I wouldn't be able

838
00:45:38,679 --> 00:45:39,880
to out sculpt your Rhino.

839
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:40,780
I was kidding though.

840
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:42,179
I was a little jab.

841
00:45:42,179 --> 00:45:43,280
That wasn't real.

842
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,280
Oh, mine was a jab too.

843
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:46,679
Okay, we're cool.

844
00:45:46,679 --> 00:45:47,079
We're good.

845
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,380
They're not coming from here anymore.

846
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:51,480
Okay, mine are getting through.

847
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:53,750
They actually

848
00:45:54,949 --> 00:45:55,550
a little bit.

849
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:02,099
Sword is the worst weapon in the game.

850
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:02,900
What are you talking about?

851
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:05,500
But there's a sword.

852
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:06,599
That's what I told you.

853
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:07,300
I was upgrading it.

854
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:09,179
I want a swordy look.

855
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:22,650
Yeah, it's a I got three upgrades in it.

856
00:46:25,639 --> 00:46:26,139
I like it.

857
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:29,289
Remember this is a spear.

858
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:33,030
It's kind of both isn't it?

859
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:34,429
Maybe it is a spear.

860
00:46:34,429 --> 00:46:34,829
You're right.

861
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:42,730
It's a glaive.

862
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:43,030
Yeah.

863
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:47,329
Did you press G?

864
00:46:47,829 --> 00:46:48,230
I did.

865
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:50,230
I wasn't I was adjusting my settings.

866
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,320
Webcam better not be bigger than mine.

867
00:46:59,139 --> 00:47:01,139
Okay, I can't I'll tap and make that joke anymore.

868
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:12,389
Wow, that is a lot of drop.

869
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:21,260
This is pretty fun.

870
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:25,679
I can see how this is just the beginning.

871
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:28,380
This is just baby mode.

872
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:33,780
So you explore I was very very confused and you tried to explain this to me before we started but

873
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:37,079
so they did orcs must die one and two

874
00:47:37,679 --> 00:47:38,579
and then they made like

875
00:47:39,179 --> 00:47:42,880
a shitload of other games that were not orcs must die one.

876
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:45,179
I we played one of them together once.

877
00:47:45,179 --> 00:47:46,880
I can't remember what it was actually called.

878
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:48,079
Yeah, it was like

879
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,380
orcs must die like forever

880
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,079
and it was a mobile game

881
00:47:52,679 --> 00:47:56,380
and it was meant to be a live service forever

882
00:47:57,519 --> 00:47:58,920
and it was not good

883
00:47:59,619 --> 00:48:01,719
and then I think they tried something like that again.

884
00:48:04,639 --> 00:48:06,340
But orcs must die to is a great game.

885
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:09,039
So we were excited first one the first couple were good.

886
00:48:09,039 --> 00:48:10,039
Yeah, right.

887
00:48:10,039 --> 00:48:13,480
Remember looks like you need some help over here.

888
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:15,780
Oh sick.

889
00:48:18,239 --> 00:48:19,940
Is that the blade of unrelenting?

890
00:48:26,429 --> 00:48:30,179
Wow game was strongest weapon in the game.

891
00:48:30,179 --> 00:48:33,179
The game was a stadia exclusive for a while.

892
00:48:33,179 --> 00:48:33,980
Oh that too.

893
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:34,380
That too.

894
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:34,679
Yes.

895
00:48:46,949 --> 00:48:47,650
Stadia

896
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:50,409
this is it's so wild.

897
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:53,710
Oh just how fast that came out and how fast it went away.

898
00:48:54,409 --> 00:48:55,510
Yeah, did you own a stadia?

899
00:48:58,610 --> 00:49:00,010
I mean stadia came out.

900
00:49:00,309 --> 00:49:02,309
It's called Xbox game pass and it's awesome.

901
00:49:02,409 --> 00:49:03,909
Like that's like the actual stadia

902
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:05,309
in my opinion.

903
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:07,960
Play it.

904
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,159
You can play shit on the cloud.

905
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:14,179
It's just to me that was that's where it where it evolved into

906
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:16,369
or can you tell me more?

907
00:49:18,139 --> 00:49:21,239
I know it's like a meme that I talk about Xbox game.

908
00:49:21,239 --> 00:49:23,940
Every time we have played a game together like the last four

909
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:25,440
times you've brought it up.

910
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,840
I know I know and people like not this shit again.

911
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:28,340
Shut the fuck up.

912
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,539
I know I know I know that's why I'm not going to say anything.

913
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:47,340
But if I were to say anything it would like this fortnight

914
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:57,800
dance five star or five skull.

915
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:58,199
Sorry.

916
00:50:04,090 --> 00:50:04,389
All right.

917
00:50:04,389 --> 00:50:07,190
What about some of these other there's the tar trap.

918
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:08,590
There is the gravity pillar.

919
00:50:09,289 --> 00:50:11,369
There is I didn't see it.

920
00:50:11,369 --> 00:50:14,070
You could just unlock you can just like user skulls to unlock

921
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:14,570
stuff.

922
00:50:15,769 --> 00:50:16,869
Seems like a lot of things.

923
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:23,130
There are a lot of things you're using the broadsword sprays

924
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:26,030
aloe acid fountain damaging enemies and applying acid.

925
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:27,730
Maybe I'm going to think I'm going to get the acid plate.

926
00:50:31,809 --> 00:50:33,210
I'm going to try the wizard staff.

927
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,079
Wait, were you using the wizard staff?

928
00:50:38,579 --> 00:50:41,179
I am using the blade staff.

929
00:50:43,949 --> 00:50:46,349
Okay, there's a broadsword broadsword looks pretty cool.

930
00:50:52,159 --> 00:50:53,260
Mom.

931
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:55,360
He got the cool one.

932
00:50:56,809 --> 00:50:57,309
I did.

933
00:50:58,619 --> 00:50:59,320
Wait, can I not?

934
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:00,019
Oh, it's six.

935
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:04,269
That's not fair.

936
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:16,980
I think I'm already he doesn't realize they have this on Roblox.

937
00:51:19,579 --> 00:51:23,050
That's why we should we just go play Roblox.

938
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:24,349
That's not what we're playing today.

939
00:51:24,349 --> 00:51:26,750
Only the oldest living warmage can open riffs.

940
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:27,949
Wouldn't that mean?

941
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:29,449
Yes, Kelsey.

942
00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:32,750
The oldest is master Cygnus if he is still alive.

943
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:35,550
Why would master decide on my upgrades?

944
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:36,449
I didn't take anything.

945
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:38,650
We didn't pick any upgrades.

946
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:40,150
No riffs provide magic.

947
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:43,150
This magic is not a positive force.

948
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:43,349
All right.

949
00:51:43,349 --> 00:51:44,750
So how big is the acid trap?

950
00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:47,550
I must travel elsewhere for answers.

951
00:51:47,949 --> 00:51:50,949
So they can only she takes a vacation.

952
00:51:51,349 --> 00:51:51,949
It's cool.

953
00:51:51,949 --> 00:51:54,449
Can they come from the other side over there on the top middle?

954
00:51:54,550 --> 00:51:56,650
No, so they only can come from here.

955
00:51:57,250 --> 00:52:00,849
Yeah, the mini map shows the one exclamation point at the moment.

956
00:52:00,849 --> 00:52:05,650
I'm doing I only have enough to do acid and then I'll maybe slow them down.

957
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:10,360
You can do whatever you want.

958
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:11,860
I did it.

959
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:12,559
I'm ready.

960
00:52:13,559 --> 00:52:14,559
Now's the time.

961
00:52:15,059 --> 00:52:16,059
We want roblox.

962
00:52:16,059 --> 00:52:17,260
We want roblox.

963
00:52:22,159 --> 00:52:24,860
Enemies are preparing to breach one of our gates.

964
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,079
You hold two weapons.

965
00:52:31,079 --> 00:52:33,280
You have like the staff and the gun.

966
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:36,480
Yeah, it is treated as if it is just an item flux.

967
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:44,000
So you can probably have up to as many as you want.

968
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:52,079
You're just slaying.

969
00:52:58,670 --> 00:52:59,769
You're getting some kills too.

970
00:53:09,309 --> 00:53:12,110
I wonder if we can turn up the difficulty because we are kind of destroying this.

971
00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:12,610
Yeah.

972
00:53:13,989 --> 00:53:15,289
Yeah, those are cobalt.

973
00:53:15,289 --> 00:53:16,389
We say that now, but we'll see.

974
00:53:17,789 --> 00:53:18,989
I was kind of born for this.

975
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:27,780
It is Wednesday after all.

976
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:28,179
Yep.

977
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:30,880
I was sparkle on.

978
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,119
You're letting a few through.

979
00:53:42,989 --> 00:53:45,289
I was getting another acid spewer.

980
00:54:03,079 --> 00:54:03,579
Let me see you.

981
00:54:03,579 --> 00:54:03,980
Did you?

982
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:04,880
Oh, no, you didn't do anything.

983
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:05,679
You didn't buy anything, right?

984
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,579
I didn't I didn't buy anything.

985
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:13,019
You like the strategy here?

986
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:16,320
They're coming from the other door now.

987
00:54:16,719 --> 00:54:18,519
Exclusively the other door.

988
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:22,340
Oh, it would be nice for you to say that.

989
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:24,639
Like I mean more than a minute ago.

990
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:26,940
They haven't come yet.

991
00:54:30,219 --> 00:54:33,789
More enemies on the way elsewhere.

992
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:53,400
You're just like you're taking all the kills.

993
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,599
I'm not going to get any experience.

994
00:54:54,599 --> 00:54:55,699
I can't buy anything.

995
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,500
Well, I put like I almost fully upgraded this thing.

996
00:55:00,199 --> 00:55:02,300
I just you're on your unstoppable.

997
00:55:04,179 --> 00:55:05,480
Well, let's turn it up to hard mode.

998
00:55:14,659 --> 00:55:16,059
How do they stop you?

999
00:55:17,639 --> 00:55:18,539
You're getting kills.

1000
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:22,849
Oh, you're how are you not doing the getting mom?

1001
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:28,980
I think they're going to come from both probably.

1002
00:55:29,079 --> 00:55:29,780
Yeah, both.

1003
00:55:30,179 --> 00:55:31,480
You want me to stay over here?

1004
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:31,880
Do you want to?

1005
00:55:33,969 --> 00:55:34,269
I don't know.

1006
00:55:34,269 --> 00:55:35,570
We'll adapt you are stir.

1007
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:35,969
Look at that.

1008
00:55:35,969 --> 00:55:37,269
Like the parkour you just did.

1009
00:55:37,869 --> 00:55:41,369
He just press jump once.

1010
00:55:48,119 --> 00:55:49,320
I'm shooting him from here, dude.

1011
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:51,139
Nice.

1012
00:55:53,570 --> 00:55:54,469
We're really doing it.

1013
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:00,960
Oh my God.

1014
00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:04,809
All right.

1015
00:56:04,809 --> 00:56:08,110
This right click on this weapon is very good.

1016
00:56:08,110 --> 00:56:09,010
It's incredible.

1017
00:56:09,710 --> 00:56:09,909
Yeah.

1018
00:56:09,909 --> 00:56:10,710
Well, you got mana.

1019
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:12,519
Okay.

1020
00:56:12,519 --> 00:56:14,119
I think they're just coming from over here now.

1021
00:56:19,159 --> 00:56:28,400
Oh, I missed my grenades launching over there correctly.

1022
00:56:28,699 --> 00:56:29,099
Yeah.

1023
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,079
These orcs should go another way.

1024
00:56:38,579 --> 00:56:39,980
That sounded like an angry bird.

1025
00:56:42,590 --> 00:56:42,989
Oops.

1026
00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:47,000
Oh, sir.

1027
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:47,800
Shoot over here.

1028
00:56:48,099 --> 00:56:49,500
I was kind of tunnel visioned.

1029
00:56:53,590 --> 00:56:53,889
What?

1030
00:56:59,130 --> 00:57:00,630
Maybe maybe we got to stay on easy.

1031
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:08,179
I thought yeah, you told me they were only coming from the other side.

1032
00:57:10,239 --> 00:57:10,739
I lied.

1033
00:57:18,139 --> 00:57:18,639
Yeah.

1034
00:57:19,639 --> 00:57:20,440
I lied.

1035
00:57:21,719 --> 00:57:23,320
That's not very fucking nice.

1036
00:57:25,619 --> 00:57:27,420
So, oh my God, you can spam that.

1037
00:57:27,519 --> 00:57:30,820
How'd you enjoy talking to me about playing POE for a whole week

1038
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:31,420
and then not playing?

1039
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:33,719
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1040
00:57:33,719 --> 00:57:34,320
Hold on a minute.

1041
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:34,820
Excuse me.

1042
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:37,320
I hit you up two different times.

1043
00:57:38,219 --> 00:57:38,519
Yeah.

1044
00:57:38,719 --> 00:57:40,420
And you were not available.

1045
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:41,019
You're not ready.

1046
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:46,750
Yes, it is.

1047
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:54,289
I believe I believe I believe your exact phrasing was

1048
00:57:54,590 --> 00:57:54,889
sorry.

1049
00:57:54,889 --> 00:57:56,190
I haven't slept in three days.

1050
00:57:58,159 --> 00:58:00,659
You said I'll play tomorrow and I was like, yeah, I'm going to bed.

1051
00:58:00,659 --> 00:58:01,460
I'll see you then.

1052
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:03,460
Well, I but I asked you if you want to play over the weekend

1053
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:05,159
and you didn't say anything and then you said sorry.

1054
00:58:05,159 --> 00:58:07,159
I was asleep for three days or I haven't slept in three days.

1055
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
You ghosted me for like like a week.

1056
00:58:13,869 --> 00:58:14,670
But say that again.

1057
00:58:15,269 --> 00:58:16,469
That's simply not true.

1058
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:20,800
Sting interesting.

1059
00:58:23,539 --> 00:58:26,340
And then I asked I was like, oh man, but like I want to it's

1060
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:27,239
a complicated game.

1061
00:58:27,239 --> 00:58:28,639
I kind of need some help figuring it out.

1062
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:29,739
And you said what was it?

1063
00:58:29,739 --> 00:58:30,440
I believe it was.

1064
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:33,039
Oh, no, I'm not going to give you that much info.

1065
00:58:33,039 --> 00:58:34,840
Like it's you'll just like you'll figure it out.

1066
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:38,039
What you said you were going to play with Holly.

1067
00:58:38,539 --> 00:58:40,139
Yeah, we wanted to a guide.

1068
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:45,179
Okay, well there.

1069
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:50,469
Drama.

1070
00:58:54,059 --> 00:58:56,559
But honestly though, I do I'm like interested in playing it.

1071
00:58:58,210 --> 00:59:04,400
I I opened it and I looked at I looked at like what it was

1072
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:08,320
and I got to I got to the point where you have like skill

1073
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:13,519
gems and then I saw the gigantic I got to the gigantic spider

1074
00:59:13,519 --> 00:59:14,119
web though.

1075
00:59:14,119 --> 00:59:16,820
I just looked at like the spider web of points to put in.

1076
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:23,239
I was like it was so you got you got to level two.

1077
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:24,039
Yep.

1078
00:59:24,039 --> 00:59:28,659
I was waiting looking for my guide my guide.

1079
00:59:28,659 --> 00:59:31,360
I didn't sleep for like a week and I've been playing.

1080
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:32,059
I was there.

1081
00:59:32,059 --> 00:59:32,960
I've been playing.

1082
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,280
I don't know how this I don't know how this is on me.

1083
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:41,179
This is all you I asked you for help and you said you would

1084
00:59:41,179 --> 00:59:42,280
didn't want to give it to me.

1085
00:59:48,159 --> 00:59:51,070
I say I like acid the acid.

1086
00:59:51,769 --> 00:59:52,469
Yes, it's pretty good.

1087
00:59:57,090 --> 00:59:57,489
Okay.

1088
00:59:57,489 --> 00:59:59,590
Are we are we going are we done?

1089
01:00:00,289 --> 01:00:00,989
Yeah, let's keep going.

1090
01:00:02,019 --> 01:00:03,920
I don't think we can even do the higher difficulty.

1091
01:00:05,429 --> 01:00:06,829
I don't think it's like unlocked or anything.

1092
01:00:07,329 --> 01:00:10,030
I think we have to beat like the game on the regular difficulty.

1093
01:00:10,030 --> 01:00:12,329
So do you think the sources will be back soon?

1094
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:14,130
We're doing pretty well.

1095
01:00:14,130 --> 01:00:16,429
We allowed to select difficulty before we started.

1096
01:00:17,230 --> 01:00:19,329
Yeah, but I think there's three difficulties though.

1097
01:00:19,730 --> 01:00:22,530
One two, three three was great out to know all the answers.

1098
01:00:22,929 --> 01:00:26,130
Then tell me why glue does it stick to the inside run to we

1099
01:00:26,130 --> 01:00:26,630
are on two.

1100
01:00:27,329 --> 01:00:32,110
Okay, there are passive things as well.

1101
01:00:32,110 --> 01:00:33,210
This is a passive trinket.

1102
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:39,059
Somebody said I hope steam goes down again and the person up

1103
01:00:39,059 --> 01:00:39,559
for five minutes.

1104
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:54,710
Okay, so we got I am going to get this side situated.

1105
01:00:54,710 --> 01:00:56,909
Okay, but do you see you see the top mini map now?

1106
01:00:56,909 --> 01:00:58,610
There's like no one coming from the side yet.

1107
01:00:59,110 --> 01:01:01,610
Yes, but I feel like I want to prepare eventually.

1108
01:01:02,010 --> 01:01:03,309
Okay, you can save your money.

1109
01:01:05,559 --> 01:01:21,199
I'm going to just go like you're a grouchy old man.

1110
01:01:23,199 --> 01:01:23,599
I'm fine.

1111
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:25,300
Okay, you didn't have to go there.

1112
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:27,900
But okay, I'm going to have a cool.

1113
01:01:28,099 --> 01:01:30,800
No, I think I'm kind of cool young hip guy with my rollerblades.

1114
01:01:32,170 --> 01:01:33,769
Somebody was saying that about me not you.

1115
01:01:33,769 --> 01:01:34,570
I was responding.

1116
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:37,139
We kind of said it out loud to me.

1117
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:41,869
You're going to you're going to have to watch your your tone.

1118
01:01:45,989 --> 01:01:47,190
I'm fragile.

1119
01:01:51,070 --> 01:01:53,570
I don't I think you're pretty like strong.

1120
01:01:54,369 --> 01:01:57,869
Wait, so does Holly talk in my chat because you won't see it.

1121
01:01:58,369 --> 01:01:59,170
That's kind of sad.

1122
01:02:02,429 --> 01:02:03,530
All these one of your mugs.

1123
01:02:04,329 --> 01:02:10,559
Yeah, you must and you're not going to even mod me.

1124
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:15,059
Yeah, I unmodded literally everybody great packed.

1125
01:02:15,559 --> 01:02:16,960
Yeah, I know, but you've okay.

1126
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:17,460
You know what?

1127
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:19,460
You know, how many don't unmod me on yours.

1128
01:02:19,559 --> 01:02:20,860
I've been I was grandfathered in.

1129
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,199
Yeah, I wouldn't I wouldn't unmod you.

1130
01:02:28,199 --> 01:02:31,699
I trust you like if I walk away from my computer.

1131
01:02:31,699 --> 01:02:33,400
Hey, but wait, I won't have to mute you.

1132
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:35,300
Who has a longer sub to the other person?

1133
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,260
Fuck, I think it is.

1134
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:41,559
I remember this being a thing.

1135
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:46,860
Who has a longer sub to well, well to counter that.

1136
01:02:47,559 --> 01:02:50,260
I am the longest sub to my own channel.

1137
01:02:50,260 --> 01:02:53,059
I have the first subscriber badge to my own channel.

1138
01:02:53,059 --> 01:02:53,760
Everybody has that.

1139
01:02:54,159 --> 01:02:55,360
No, they don't type in your chat.

1140
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:55,960
You don't have it.

1141
01:02:57,639 --> 01:03:03,519
What's this guys waiting?

1142
01:03:06,510 --> 01:03:07,309
Nope doesn't have it.

1143
01:03:07,610 --> 01:03:08,409
I mean don't have it.

1144
01:03:10,630 --> 01:03:14,530
Mine has a founder a founder like, you know, when like someone

1145
01:03:14,530 --> 01:03:17,929
is the like it keeps track of the first 50 subs to a channel

1146
01:03:17,929 --> 01:03:21,329
are yeah, I'm I'm the fifth subscriber to my channel.

1147
01:03:21,829 --> 01:03:22,630
How is that possible?

1148
01:03:22,630 --> 01:03:25,829
Because isn't every streamer just automatically has the sub

1149
01:03:25,829 --> 01:03:27,030
badge of their own channel.

1150
01:03:27,429 --> 01:03:28,130
Exactly.

1151
01:03:28,329 --> 01:03:29,230
So how does that make any sense?

1152
01:03:29,230 --> 01:03:30,829
What you can't even subscribe to yourself.

1153
01:03:31,030 --> 01:03:31,230
Yeah.

1154
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:31,829
So what happened?

1155
01:03:32,630 --> 01:03:37,030
I'm I paid for my own subscription to my own channel for like

1156
01:03:37,030 --> 01:03:37,730
three years.

1157
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:42,809
What so I've been subscribed to me longer than you've been

1158
01:03:42,809 --> 01:03:43,510
subscribed to me.

1159
01:03:43,510 --> 01:03:45,409
So I'm my number one best enemy.

1160
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:47,239
That's true.

1161
01:03:50,769 --> 01:03:53,469
I know Twitch like you used to not be able to use your own

1162
01:03:53,469 --> 01:03:55,570
emotes unless you were subscribed to your own channel

1163
01:03:55,570 --> 01:03:58,269
like a long long long time ago way.

1164
01:03:58,269 --> 01:03:58,469
Wait.

1165
01:03:58,469 --> 01:03:58,769
Yeah, right.

1166
01:03:58,769 --> 01:04:01,469
When they when they switched over so I just so I paid Twitch

1167
01:04:01,570 --> 01:04:05,170
to let me use my emotes and now it's funny because they

1168
01:04:05,170 --> 01:04:12,710
added the like you're you're your own first subscriber bad.

1169
01:04:16,849 --> 01:04:24,269
Oh the misery don't trust anyone not even yourself honestly.

1170
01:04:24,869 --> 01:04:28,469
Yeah, and you know how many times I've like left reminders

1171
01:04:28,469 --> 01:04:30,269
for myself and I just fucking forgot about them.

1172
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:34,840
Every time I said, oh I need to like oh, yeah, I really

1173
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:37,840
should like put away that fucking spaghetti and I don't

1174
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:39,239
do it and I say I'm going to do it.

1175
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:44,179
I'm going to trust you.

1176
01:04:48,409 --> 01:04:49,309
All right, they're coming from both.

1177
01:04:49,909 --> 01:04:55,719
What a what a what a difficult life that must be what

1178
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:58,320
I don't even trust myself.

1179
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:02,570
What to put spaghetti away.

1180
01:05:02,969 --> 01:05:04,570
Well, I got to put the spaghetti where I'm like, oh you

1181
01:05:04,570 --> 01:05:05,070
piece of shit.

1182
01:05:05,070 --> 01:05:05,670
You're not going to do it.

1183
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:09,599
Are you you ain't food that sat out for like a week.

1184
01:05:10,099 --> 01:05:15,199
You have no say in this one day and also it was my wife

1185
01:05:15,199 --> 01:05:15,900
that left it out.

1186
01:05:17,099 --> 01:05:20,309
So not me.

1187
01:05:21,010 --> 01:05:23,510
Oh, it's so you so now we're you're deflecting now.

1188
01:05:23,510 --> 01:05:24,010
It's not.

1189
01:05:24,610 --> 01:05:25,110
What do you mean?

1190
01:05:25,510 --> 01:05:26,309
What do you mean?

1191
01:05:27,409 --> 01:05:30,909
All right, so now now now every ounce of the anguish in

1192
01:05:30,909 --> 01:05:35,929
my life is her more enemies all the way Jesus.

1193
01:05:40,550 --> 01:05:41,449
I think you can handle that.

1194
01:05:41,449 --> 01:05:42,150
I'll stay over here.

1195
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:45,760
Honestly, it's not going well.

1196
01:05:46,159 --> 01:05:46,559
Really?

1197
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:46,860
Okay.

1198
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:51,889
These little runners don't have a giant cleave sword.

1199
01:05:55,940 --> 01:05:57,440
I watched the right side though, because they're actually

1200
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:00,730
going to probably start going that way in a minute when

1201
01:06:00,730 --> 01:06:01,329
they do.

1202
01:06:05,269 --> 01:06:05,969
Yes, I did.

1203
01:06:05,969 --> 01:06:06,670
Have I Pete?

1204
01:06:06,670 --> 01:06:08,269
Yeah, I know someone's gonna say I do have to look down

1205
01:06:08,269 --> 01:06:09,369
at my keyboard to press five.

1206
01:06:09,369 --> 01:06:10,369
All right, stop.

1207
01:06:12,460 --> 01:06:13,460
Somebody was thinking it.

1208
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:14,659
That's sad.

1209
01:06:30,619 --> 01:06:31,219
So good on the left.

1210
01:06:31,219 --> 01:06:34,480
Yep, man.

1211
01:06:36,090 --> 01:06:38,789
It'd be pretty sad to be classified as a light work.

1212
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:42,440
What like you just like smaller?

1213
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:46,309
Yeah, like oh shit.

1214
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:49,300
Oh shit.

1215
01:06:51,099 --> 01:06:53,199
I thought you were reacting to what would happen if you

1216
01:06:53,199 --> 01:06:58,000
were classified as a light or I'm reacting to the light

1217
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,300
works getting past us.

1218
01:07:05,690 --> 01:07:05,889
All right.

1219
01:07:05,889 --> 01:07:08,789
Next wave coming next wave get it get your head in the

1220
01:07:08,789 --> 01:07:09,289
game.

1221
01:07:09,590 --> 01:07:11,389
My hands in the game has the game.

1222
01:07:14,219 --> 01:07:15,219
I think we just stay in the middle.

1223
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:17,820
Just stay we should just be staying here.

1224
01:07:19,539 --> 01:07:20,539
That makes a lot of sense.

1225
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:26,619
I mean, I know this looks like shit, but it's it's

1226
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:28,519
practicality not for looks.

1227
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,219
I don't think they walk through here.

1228
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:33,619
They don't walk through the middle where you're putting

1229
01:07:33,619 --> 01:07:34,019
the trap.

1230
01:08:04,610 --> 01:08:05,409
Left side is clear.

1231
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:21,279
I believe it truly epic.

1232
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:22,159
All right.

1233
01:08:22,159 --> 01:08:24,359
So let me sell all this then because if they're not

1234
01:08:24,359 --> 01:08:26,359
going to come through here that maybe they will eventually

1235
01:08:26,359 --> 01:08:28,859
or no, I just know you can see the path they're taking

1236
01:08:28,859 --> 01:08:29,159
on.

1237
01:08:29,260 --> 01:08:30,359
Oh my goodness.

1238
01:08:30,359 --> 01:08:30,760
You can.

1239
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:31,159
All right.

1240
01:08:31,159 --> 01:08:31,659
Hold on.

1241
01:08:32,859 --> 01:08:33,460
Yeah, you're trying it.

1242
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:34,760
You're Copia miming.

1243
01:08:35,159 --> 01:08:39,399
I am three of those there.

1244
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:44,539
Yeah.

1245
01:08:44,539 --> 01:08:50,239
But anyway, Holly was saying that she is extremely sad

1246
01:08:50,239 --> 01:08:53,739
that you didn't play Pue really looking forward to

1247
01:08:53,739 --> 01:08:57,739
I was too and it's kind of messed up.

1248
01:09:00,689 --> 01:09:05,720
Maybe don't maybe don't ghost me if you don't ghost me

1249
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:06,520
for like five days.

1250
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:16,050
Okay, so it's like it's totally okay for you to do a

1251
01:09:16,050 --> 01:09:20,000
roblox birthday party when we only had a we had prior

1252
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,869
plans again.

1253
01:09:23,369 --> 01:09:24,569
Totally okay again.

1254
01:09:24,569 --> 01:09:26,670
I just want to make this really clear you.

1255
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:31,140
I'm sorry, but somebody's birthday party is going to

1256
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:32,539
take priority.

1257
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:35,539
That's a little selfish thing.

1258
01:09:37,239 --> 01:09:38,739
Who whose birthday was it?

1259
01:09:38,739 --> 01:09:39,340
Are you asking?

1260
01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:39,939
They was it.

1261
01:09:39,939 --> 01:09:40,340
Yes.

1262
01:09:40,439 --> 01:09:42,739
Oh local e-clown.

1263
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:44,439
It was their birthday.

1264
01:09:44,739 --> 01:09:47,239
Oh, just push that right back at you.

1265
01:09:47,239 --> 01:09:52,390
Didn't I which mod just like told you that?

1266
01:09:52,390 --> 01:09:52,789
Nope.

1267
01:09:52,890 --> 01:09:54,289
There was not enough time because you know, you know

1268
01:09:54,289 --> 01:09:55,090
about stream delay.

1269
01:09:55,289 --> 01:09:56,289
It wasn't enough time.

1270
01:09:58,680 --> 01:09:59,779
Aren't you on like quantum?

1271
01:10:00,079 --> 01:10:01,079
You're not in quantum yet.

1272
01:10:04,579 --> 01:10:07,079
I switched to quantum my mods responding to things that

1273
01:10:07,079 --> 01:10:07,880
I haven't even done yet.

1274
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:08,279
They're like dude.

1275
01:10:08,279 --> 01:10:09,380
No, no, no, don't say that.

1276
01:10:09,380 --> 01:10:10,180
That's too much.

1277
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:12,880
Well, I think they caught me a couple of times already

1278
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:16,079
the stream were like I was gonna I'm sorry.

1279
01:10:16,079 --> 01:10:18,380
Did that thing happen to where I've just I'm not hearing

1280
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:18,880
anything.

1281
01:10:23,170 --> 01:10:23,770
I'm sorry.

1282
01:10:23,770 --> 01:10:25,069
It happens a lot but like you.

1283
01:10:32,130 --> 01:10:32,729
I'm sorry.

1284
01:10:35,630 --> 01:10:36,329
No problem.

1285
01:10:37,210 --> 01:10:38,609
What's the best class in POE?

1286
01:10:45,270 --> 01:10:46,069
That's for what?

1287
01:10:46,470 --> 01:10:49,010
I don't know room clear.

1288
01:10:57,960 --> 01:10:58,460
I don't know.

1289
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:02,199
I don't know man.

1290
01:11:02,199 --> 01:11:03,500
What do you what do you play in POE?

1291
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Can you even answer that?

1292
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,199
There's like 5,000 classes in POE isn't there?

1293
01:11:09,659 --> 01:11:12,560
There are actually there's nine ascendancies.

1294
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:15,359
Yeah, or nine classes.

1295
01:11:16,670 --> 01:11:18,670
Or there's a lot.

1296
01:11:19,970 --> 01:11:21,069
They're all good at different stuff.

1297
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:26,060
I think which is probably still the most played is POE 2.

1298
01:11:27,390 --> 01:11:28,189
When is it coming out?

1299
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:34,020
Exile con which is going to announce POE 2 stuff is the

1300
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:36,319
end of July.

1301
01:11:38,119 --> 01:11:41,720
Is it worth waiting for that or is it better just to play

1302
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:45,220
like I mean, I kind of want to play it my take would have

1303
01:11:45,220 --> 01:11:49,819
been wait, but like if you're really interested it's I think

1304
01:11:49,819 --> 01:11:51,520
POE 2 is going to be different enough that you'll be able to

1305
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:55,670
like you'll get like two different play experiences of

1306
01:11:55,670 --> 01:11:56,770
playing now and playing later.

1307
01:11:56,770 --> 01:11:59,069
You're not really going to like miss.

1308
01:11:59,869 --> 01:12:03,869
Yeah, or I don't know.

1309
01:12:04,170 --> 01:12:05,069
I don't know how to phrase it.

1310
01:12:06,010 --> 01:12:08,710
They're different enough is set up to it's it's not an

1311
01:12:08,710 --> 01:12:11,510
Overwatch 2 situation where it's not going to be any

1312
01:12:11,510 --> 01:12:12,310
different at all.

1313
01:12:13,510 --> 01:12:17,010
If there's there's slated a lot of change and it's a whole

1314
01:12:17,010 --> 01:12:18,109
completely different campaign.

1315
01:12:18,109 --> 01:12:19,909
So like you played through this campaign.

1316
01:12:19,909 --> 01:12:21,909
It would be very different if you played POE 2 later.

1317
01:12:23,579 --> 01:12:25,779
Yes, I'll play it then I'll still play it.

1318
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:30,920
Oh my God.

1319
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:31,720
He remembered.

1320
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:32,720
Yeah, I did.

1321
01:12:33,119 --> 01:12:34,020
I remembered your birthday.

1322
01:12:35,859 --> 01:12:36,659
When's my birthday?

1323
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:39,020
August.

1324
01:12:41,539 --> 01:12:42,239
When's my birthday?

1325
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:46,899
Yeah, okay.

1326
01:12:48,699 --> 01:12:49,600
So there we are.

1327
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:52,600
Then you can't say that you cannot fight me on this one.

1328
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:54,100
I'm not like googling.

1329
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:55,500
My hands are up cops.

1330
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:56,199
You got me.

1331
01:12:57,970 --> 01:12:59,670
I'm going to I'm just going to throw a guess out.

1332
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,600
But I'm going to think for a second because you would have

1333
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:05,800
done like a like drama drama stream of birthday a fun

1334
01:13:05,899 --> 01:13:07,100
and I'm just thinking if there was one.

1335
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,199
I'm going to say May 4th.

1336
01:13:10,710 --> 01:13:12,510
Not even in the right fucking season.

1337
01:13:12,909 --> 01:13:13,310
Okay.

1338
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:18,140
Oh man, you were.

1339
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:20,340
Oh no, because you were coming at me.

1340
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:22,340
That's Star Wars.

1341
01:13:22,539 --> 01:13:22,840
What?

1342
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:23,539
That's not you.

1343
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:24,439
May the 4th be with you.

1344
01:13:24,439 --> 01:13:25,539
That's Star Wars day.

1345
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:29,239
Yeah, all I'm saying is but if you're going to come at me

1346
01:13:29,239 --> 01:13:30,140
with that kind of a

1347
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:31,439
Hey, when's my birthday?

1348
01:13:32,039 --> 01:13:33,840
Then you better know my birthday.

1349
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:34,340
You know what I mean?

1350
01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:35,239
You better know mine.

1351
01:13:38,140 --> 01:13:38,840
September.

1352
01:13:40,439 --> 01:13:42,439
I wonder if you were reading a chat room.

1353
01:13:43,039 --> 01:13:44,239
No, I'm remembering.

1354
01:13:44,439 --> 01:13:50,380
I'm remembering our long lasting friendship and all of

1355
01:13:50,380 --> 01:13:52,380
the birthdays that we shared together.

1356
01:13:52,479 --> 01:13:53,680
May 4th.

1357
01:13:53,779 --> 01:13:55,680
May the 4th be with you.

1358
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:56,680
That's so funny.

1359
01:13:58,399 --> 01:13:58,600
All right.

1360
01:13:58,600 --> 01:13:59,199
What do you upgrade?

1361
01:14:00,430 --> 01:14:02,430
I don't know alchemist satchel.

1362
01:14:02,430 --> 01:14:03,229
I thought I upgraded.

1363
01:14:03,229 --> 01:14:04,229
I didn't I didn't have it.

1364
01:14:04,329 --> 01:14:04,930
With me.

1365
01:14:05,130 --> 01:14:07,430
So you got like a quick weapon differently.

1366
01:14:08,430 --> 01:14:09,529
Yeah, you just put on your loadout.

1367
01:14:10,989 --> 01:14:13,989
Where do you modify the loadout in the in the game?

1368
01:14:13,989 --> 01:14:14,989
Like when we're actually in the game?

1369
01:14:14,989 --> 01:14:15,590
It's B.

1370
01:14:17,750 --> 01:14:18,149
Okay.

1371
01:14:18,350 --> 01:14:19,350
Well, I'm ready.

1372
01:14:20,609 --> 01:14:25,020
I think yeah, you can do your loadout when before we get

1373
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:25,819
the first wave.

1374
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:28,529
Okay.

1375
01:14:35,789 --> 01:14:36,590
What's this title?

1376
01:14:36,789 --> 01:14:37,390
It's pretty bad.

1377
01:14:38,590 --> 01:14:42,590
We are not facing something new, but something very old.

1378
01:14:43,189 --> 01:14:46,140
Oh, how we've just been killing orcs and stuff.

1379
01:14:46,239 --> 01:14:47,039
No big deal.

1380
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:48,079
Okay.

1381
01:14:48,079 --> 01:14:50,279
So what's the deal with these strange?

1382
01:14:50,380 --> 01:14:55,079
Oh, we can change their route with that new thing.

1383
01:14:55,079 --> 01:15:01,539
We got I'm going to leave that up to you because I that's

1384
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:04,640
there's like math involved with that and game mechanics

1385
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:05,840
and game awareness.

1386
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:06,739
I'm going to leave that up to you.

1387
01:15:07,699 --> 01:15:08,699
Yeah, there's like math.

1388
01:15:13,449 --> 01:15:14,649
I'll be the blocker.

1389
01:15:15,649 --> 01:15:15,850
All right.

1390
01:15:15,850 --> 01:15:17,550
So what how do you want to handle this?

1391
01:15:17,550 --> 01:15:20,649
Do you want to block everybody from like this way so they

1392
01:15:20,649 --> 01:15:22,449
have to go up this did this staircase?

1393
01:15:23,710 --> 01:15:25,409
I feel like that's a good idea.

1394
01:15:26,250 --> 01:15:26,550
Thank you.

1395
01:15:26,550 --> 01:15:29,949
We can just block the stairs and then yeah, then they go

1396
01:15:29,949 --> 01:15:30,850
to the other stairs.

1397
01:15:31,149 --> 01:15:33,350
Okay, so they can't like walk around here.

1398
01:15:33,350 --> 01:15:37,439
Yeah, so I'm going to just focus on one stair.

1399
01:15:37,939 --> 01:15:41,239
Yeah, so then we just focus on the stairs and I'm going

1400
01:15:41,239 --> 01:15:42,039
to go like this.

1401
01:15:43,340 --> 01:15:46,439
I'm going to save my money and then we got out.

1402
01:15:46,439 --> 01:15:47,340
We got a teleporter.

1403
01:15:48,539 --> 01:15:49,239
There is a tip.

1404
01:15:49,239 --> 01:15:49,840
Where does it go?

1405
01:15:50,439 --> 01:15:53,239
It goes all the way to where we're defending the top of

1406
01:15:53,239 --> 01:15:53,739
the stairs.

1407
01:15:57,560 --> 01:15:58,560
It was a big staircase.

1408
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:01,359
It's pretty big, but I think if we can keep people funneled

1409
01:16:01,359 --> 01:16:02,260
this way, we should be fine.

1410
01:16:04,510 --> 01:16:05,810
What did you do for your last birthday?

1411
01:16:11,340 --> 01:16:13,039
Okay, if you don't even remember how am I supposed to

1412
01:16:13,039 --> 01:16:14,939
remember when your birthday is I feel like I was a really

1413
01:16:14,939 --> 01:16:16,840
busy during that period like I was there's like just a

1414
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:17,439
lot going on.

1415
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:28,460
Yeah, it sounds like I get a pass and you know, I didn't

1416
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:32,430
get a message from anybody on it though.

1417
01:16:32,930 --> 01:16:35,880
What I remember it's okay.

1418
01:16:36,579 --> 01:16:41,939
Sometimes we forget each other's you know, that's all right.

1419
01:16:41,939 --> 01:16:42,539
Let's just play.

1420
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:43,899
Yeah, that's fine.

1421
01:16:47,039 --> 01:16:47,539
Let's go.

1422
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:57,199
Open enemies are preparing to breach.

1423
01:16:57,199 --> 01:17:00,100
Whoa, that over seems bigger out here in the wild.

1424
01:17:00,199 --> 01:17:03,199
Oh, this guy remember if he hits you, he will stun you.

1425
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:05,619
Done.

1426
01:17:09,729 --> 01:17:09,930
Okay.

1427
01:17:09,930 --> 01:17:11,229
I'm throwing these green potions.

1428
01:17:11,229 --> 01:17:12,029
Don't drink any.

1429
01:17:24,060 --> 01:17:25,159
Oh, I've been stunned.

1430
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:32,880
I've been I've been stunned most dead yet.

1431
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:34,880
They don't even have to like swing if they just walk on

1432
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:35,880
you you get stunned.

1433
01:17:40,180 --> 01:17:41,180
I don't like that charge.

1434
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:42,579
I'm gonna die.

1435
01:17:43,739 --> 01:17:44,340
Can I remind you?

1436
01:17:45,439 --> 01:17:46,140
I don't know.

1437
01:17:46,739 --> 01:17:48,039
I just auto revived here.

1438
01:17:52,060 --> 01:17:53,260
This is all your fault.

1439
01:17:54,659 --> 01:17:56,460
What is what is this difficulty curve?

1440
01:17:57,359 --> 01:17:58,460
Hey, why'd you do this?

1441
01:17:58,460 --> 01:18:01,460
They taught us how to play and now they're giving us the

1442
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:02,159
real deal.

1443
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:07,619
Okay, the leash is off as they say, okay, so they obviously

1444
01:18:07,619 --> 01:18:08,819
are going a little too fast.

1445
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:12,960
So I mean, I'm gonna yeah, we should do some slow down

1446
01:18:14,729 --> 01:18:21,899
followed by more poison followed by I think that's all

1447
01:18:21,899 --> 01:18:22,100
right.

1448
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:23,500
We just need to we need to stay in one spot.

1449
01:18:24,609 --> 01:18:26,609
We need to make sure they're like bullied at the door.

1450
01:18:26,909 --> 01:18:27,810
Okay, we're ready.

1451
01:18:29,039 --> 01:18:29,340
Right.

1452
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:32,039
You know what here might as well.

1453
01:18:34,359 --> 01:18:34,960
All right, let's do it.

1454
01:18:36,600 --> 01:19:04,859
Okay, I think it's gonna be a lot of big ready and cleaner

1455
01:19:04,859 --> 01:19:05,659
killing them.

1456
01:19:05,659 --> 01:19:06,760
I'm killing them.

1457
01:19:08,100 --> 01:19:10,199
Wait, what are they getting in?

1458
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:13,000
These little runners just got by me hair.

1459
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:14,300
Nobody got by me.

1460
01:19:29,010 --> 01:19:30,010
How do you regenerate man?

1461
01:19:30,010 --> 01:19:30,909
It's just over time.

1462
01:19:30,909 --> 01:19:31,710
I think it does.

1463
01:19:33,069 --> 01:19:33,770
Oh shit.

1464
01:19:44,010 --> 01:19:46,109
There's many potions that kind of lie around and healing

1465
01:19:46,109 --> 01:19:46,609
potions.

1466
01:19:47,010 --> 01:19:52,180
I wonder how they do they spawn randomly or wonder I don't

1467
01:19:52,180 --> 01:19:52,380
know.

1468
01:19:52,380 --> 01:19:54,279
I think when probably random when you kill things.

1469
01:19:55,579 --> 01:19:56,079
All right.

1470
01:19:56,380 --> 01:19:56,979
All right.

1471
01:20:02,779 --> 01:20:03,079
Okay.

1472
01:20:07,460 --> 01:20:08,859
Look, I love streaming.

1473
01:20:09,159 --> 01:20:09,460
Okay.

1474
01:20:15,130 --> 01:20:16,229
Do I have to wait a minute?

1475
01:20:18,159 --> 01:20:20,659
Do you have to have this the artifact out for it to heal

1476
01:20:20,659 --> 01:20:23,760
you or is it just I think it has a passive effect and you

1477
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:25,260
can use it and it will heal.

1478
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:26,159
Really?

1479
01:20:26,359 --> 01:20:26,560
Okay.

1480
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:27,159
Oh, that's good to know.

1481
01:20:28,899 --> 01:20:30,100
Ooh, that's a good idea.

1482
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:35,399
I'm gonna put this one here.

1483
01:20:37,359 --> 01:20:39,060
But then I don't have to walk that way.

1484
01:20:39,359 --> 01:20:41,060
I I would sell that.

1485
01:20:41,460 --> 01:20:42,659
Yeah, I'm here.

1486
01:20:42,659 --> 01:20:43,159
I got you.

1487
01:20:43,659 --> 01:20:44,060
Okay.

1488
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:45,359
What?

1489
01:20:45,359 --> 01:20:48,739
Why don't we want them to be coming down like a really

1490
01:20:48,739 --> 01:20:49,140
narrow?

1491
01:20:50,140 --> 01:20:52,739
Which or is walking into this corner?

1492
01:20:54,079 --> 01:20:56,180
When they when enough of them come up here the ghost do

1493
01:20:56,180 --> 01:20:57,380
you see the ghost walking by?

1494
01:20:57,479 --> 01:20:59,579
Yeah, but when but when there's enough of them walking

1495
01:20:59,579 --> 01:21:00,380
they're gonna hit collision.

1496
01:21:00,380 --> 01:21:01,579
They're gonna have to spread out.

1497
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:04,619
And we want them in a narrow narrow place.

1498
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:07,399
That's it.

1499
01:21:07,399 --> 01:21:08,600
That's as narrow as it's going to be.

1500
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:11,399
I'm saying is it if like a dozen orcs walk this way then

1501
01:21:11,399 --> 01:21:12,500
you owe me a thousand dollars.

1502
01:21:13,199 --> 01:21:13,399
Okay.

1503
01:21:13,399 --> 01:21:15,699
Well, I'm just saying that the barricade is like the most

1504
01:21:15,699 --> 01:21:17,399
expensive thing we can build right now.

1505
01:21:18,199 --> 01:21:20,100
And you put it you put it in the corner.

1506
01:21:22,350 --> 01:21:22,850
Runner.

1507
01:21:24,149 --> 01:21:25,449
You got to kill these little gobbos.

1508
01:21:26,319 --> 01:21:26,619
Yeah.

1509
01:21:28,239 --> 01:21:29,239
Watch out big guy.

1510
01:21:34,340 --> 01:21:48,800
No, you owe me a thousand dollars.

1511
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:50,300
Wait one guy by me.

1512
01:21:51,829 --> 01:21:53,029
Wait, why do I I'm space?

1513
01:21:53,430 --> 01:21:55,529
I did a you and I didn't listen to anything that you said

1514
01:21:55,529 --> 01:21:55,829
you owe me.

1515
01:21:55,829 --> 01:21:56,630
You owe me a thousand dollars.

1516
01:21:57,029 --> 01:21:59,630
Why somebody went like they were walking like off the

1517
01:21:59,630 --> 01:22:00,529
traps like the right.

1518
01:22:03,789 --> 01:22:04,090
Okay.

1519
01:22:04,090 --> 01:22:06,689
Was that like was that a problem like such a problem that

1520
01:22:06,689 --> 01:22:07,289
we lost?

1521
01:22:08,229 --> 01:22:17,319
Tell me dude.

1522
01:22:18,489 --> 01:22:20,789
It's been like an hour and a half into the stream and you

1523
01:22:20,789 --> 01:22:22,689
haven't we haven't brought up like a food topic.

1524
01:22:22,689 --> 01:22:23,489
What's going on here?

1525
01:22:24,090 --> 01:22:25,789
A food a food.

1526
01:22:26,289 --> 01:22:28,789
Do you want to I know what's like you talk a lot about

1527
01:22:28,789 --> 01:22:29,289
sauces.

1528
01:22:29,289 --> 01:22:29,689
What's it?

1529
01:22:29,689 --> 01:22:30,590
What's a good sauce?

1530
01:22:30,590 --> 01:22:31,689
What's your favorite sauce right now?

1531
01:22:32,189 --> 01:22:34,789
Bingo blue cheese sauce.

1532
01:22:34,989 --> 01:22:39,890
Yeah, I would classify it as sauce not as a cheese.

1533
01:22:40,390 --> 01:22:43,090
Well like blue cheese sauce like it's blue cheese, but

1534
01:22:43,090 --> 01:22:44,989
it's also part of like that base for it.

1535
01:22:45,390 --> 01:22:46,390
What's what's the base?

1536
01:22:47,789 --> 01:22:50,489
I actually don't really know what is like in the blue

1537
01:22:50,489 --> 01:22:54,060
cheese sauce because blue cheese is obviously like blue

1538
01:22:54,060 --> 01:22:54,760
cheese crumbles.

1539
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:55,260
But what is it?

1540
01:22:55,260 --> 01:22:55,760
What is it?

1541
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:56,760
What's the basement?

1542
01:22:59,039 --> 01:22:59,840
Is it ranch?

1543
01:23:01,659 --> 01:23:04,979
I don't know if it's if it's ranch every time this milk

1544
01:23:08,579 --> 01:23:10,180
Oh, so you're allowed to talk about milk.

1545
01:23:12,050 --> 01:23:15,300
Okay, kind of weird.

1546
01:23:21,420 --> 01:23:21,720
You know what?

1547
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:25,119
I'll tell you and I people are going to they might be

1548
01:23:25,119 --> 01:23:26,920
doubters in the chat and then that's all right.

1549
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:32,250
You might be one yourself after I say this but a thin

1550
01:23:32,250 --> 01:23:36,949
crust pepperoni pizza with Tabasco sauce just like a

1551
01:23:36,949 --> 01:23:39,050
pool of it like a little pool of it on the side and a

1552
01:23:39,050 --> 01:23:41,750
pool of blue cheese on the side and you just smear that

1553
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:43,550
shit all over it and take a bite.

1554
01:23:44,619 --> 01:23:46,020
It's going to change your entire life.

1555
01:23:46,859 --> 01:23:47,960
And I know people like it.

1556
01:23:48,359 --> 01:23:50,460
I'm just I know that that's you haven't seen the light

1557
01:23:50,460 --> 01:23:53,600
yet and don't want the light.

1558
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:56,300
It was in blue cheese with Tabasco sauce.

1559
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:57,899
It has to be specifically.

1560
01:24:00,699 --> 01:24:02,699
It's a specific that hold on we're going to lose.

1561
01:24:09,789 --> 01:24:11,789
Where's the where's our limit of how many people can

1562
01:24:11,789 --> 01:24:16,189
like go in before we lose at the top and then it starts

1563
01:24:16,189 --> 01:24:16,689
at 20.

1564
01:24:22,460 --> 01:24:22,659
All right.

1565
01:24:22,659 --> 01:24:23,560
We I got a lot of money.

1566
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:24,760
So let's make sure we get this right.

1567
01:24:27,140 --> 01:24:28,039
Let's slow them down.

1568
01:24:31,689 --> 01:24:32,289
I agree.

1569
01:24:32,489 --> 01:24:34,789
I want them to be slugs coming in here.

1570
01:24:34,989 --> 01:24:39,170
I hear here come up here eat Buffalo wings known and

1571
01:24:39,170 --> 01:24:40,569
I thought you have money left.

1572
01:24:41,069 --> 01:24:42,869
I do if we did like a tarp.

1573
01:24:42,869 --> 01:24:45,770
It's all the way around this whole corner.

1574
01:24:49,100 --> 01:24:49,699
That's all I have.

1575
01:24:53,039 --> 01:24:54,340
Okay, that's all I got.

1576
01:24:56,140 --> 01:24:59,739
So so yeah, you were talking about dipping a sauce in

1577
01:24:59,739 --> 01:25:00,340
a sauce.

1578
01:25:00,739 --> 01:25:01,140
No, no, no.

1579
01:25:01,140 --> 01:25:03,539
What it sounded like for a slice of pepperoni pizza

1580
01:25:04,239 --> 01:25:06,840
and you get a little bit of Tabasco on it and then you

1581
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:09,840
dunk that into the blue cheese like sauce.

1582
01:25:11,659 --> 01:25:13,460
There are not go on pizza.

1583
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:15,460
Yes, of course.

1584
01:25:18,220 --> 01:25:19,020
I know question.

1585
01:25:19,020 --> 01:25:21,220
I know question mark question mark, but one day you're

1586
01:25:21,220 --> 01:25:24,220
going to do it just because like oh that fucking weirdo

1587
01:25:24,220 --> 01:25:27,819
on that like he clown like moron that I watched last

1588
01:25:27,819 --> 01:25:30,920
night and then your eyes are going to go through it and

1589
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:31,619
you're going to go what happened?

1590
01:25:31,619 --> 01:25:42,520
How did I not know about this and then you will be

1591
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:46,880
Officially a pepperoni pizza blue cheese Tabasco to

1592
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:47,180
site.

1593
01:25:49,750 --> 01:25:53,550
Now that I understand like the whole combo all those

1594
01:25:53,550 --> 01:25:54,949
words just don't go together.

1595
01:25:56,310 --> 01:25:59,409
What German's been having like chat GBT make his food.

1596
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:13,779
This was a good idea.

1597
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:18,600
I'm just telling you one day someone's going to try it

1598
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:21,100
and they're going to just like the tune efficient

1599
01:26:21,100 --> 01:26:23,800
pretzels and everyone's like, oh my god, dude.

1600
01:26:24,199 --> 01:26:26,699
What what wait what I haven't heard of this.

1601
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:29,300
Is this all is this the thing I'm unaware of some of

1602
01:26:29,300 --> 01:26:31,300
you guys just really need to see the light and you

1603
01:26:31,300 --> 01:26:33,399
just won't and that's fine more for me.

1604
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:36,500
Oh, if you jump while you're in the air, you do a

1605
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:36,899
thing.

1606
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:40,439
Maybe that's just a bow thing that I didn't know.

1607
01:26:40,439 --> 01:26:41,239
You can like float.

1608
01:26:41,239 --> 01:26:43,340
Yeah, you do like a ground pound.

1609
01:26:46,590 --> 01:26:47,390
We're just going.

1610
01:26:48,090 --> 01:26:50,989
I think we are just I guess so I wasn't ready.

1611
01:26:55,689 --> 01:26:57,390
Let's get that same concept over here.

1612
01:27:08,659 --> 01:27:10,159
There's some enzyme.

1613
01:27:10,460 --> 01:27:11,359
I don't know what it is.

1614
01:27:11,659 --> 01:27:14,859
It's something to do with the enzymes of the food

1615
01:27:15,659 --> 01:27:19,460
but like a pretzel stick into a fresh thing of

1616
01:27:19,460 --> 01:27:21,659
good tuna like solid albacore tuna.

1617
01:27:24,210 --> 01:27:25,909
It's just something about it the same thing with

1618
01:27:25,909 --> 01:27:28,710
the blue cheese Tabasco and pizza.

1619
01:27:32,569 --> 01:27:37,960
You know, there's some sort of enzyme that validates

1620
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:39,760
your your bad taste.

1621
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:42,460
No, how you have I'm going to make I'm going to

1622
01:27:42,460 --> 01:27:45,060
like make this I saw you licking your lips to the

1623
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:46,159
dog food the other day.

1624
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:52,920
That was a joke though.

1625
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:56,720
We're talking about a piece of comedic work.

1626
01:27:58,909 --> 01:28:00,810
Not a real thought of mine.

1627
01:28:03,289 --> 01:28:05,689
So like laughing at the cars was awful a bit.

1628
01:28:09,409 --> 01:28:11,210
I don't actually think cars are funny.

1629
01:28:12,310 --> 01:28:12,909
No, I do.

1630
01:28:13,810 --> 01:28:14,310
Okay.

1631
01:28:15,710 --> 01:28:18,310
Making sure we're not like I think that heals you

1632
01:28:18,310 --> 01:28:19,010
too, by the way.

1633
01:28:19,510 --> 01:28:19,909
Yeah.

1634
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:26,779
Oh, I got a stun.

1635
01:28:27,079 --> 01:28:28,279
That's good to know.

1636
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:31,079
Yeah, but you can't give me shit for the car thing

1637
01:28:31,479 --> 01:28:35,079
when back in the old days of YouTube you were like

1638
01:28:35,079 --> 01:28:38,680
the king of the car go fast into like a wall joke.

1639
01:28:39,180 --> 01:28:40,680
I think I think cars are funny.

1640
01:28:41,380 --> 01:28:41,680
Okay.

1641
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:43,779
Oh, so you weren't I just I was just bringing up

1642
01:28:43,779 --> 01:28:46,279
because you felt like really self-conscious about

1643
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:47,680
Oh, no, they weren't on the same page.

1644
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:50,979
Then I have some complex feelings that I think cars

1645
01:28:50,979 --> 01:28:53,779
are both funny and also I hate all cars and

1646
01:28:54,079 --> 01:28:55,479
I wish I could destroy them all.

1647
01:28:56,380 --> 01:28:56,779
Okay.

1648
01:29:00,399 --> 01:29:02,199
I'm getting this giant flip trap.

1649
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:08,800
Ooh, mega boom barrel launcher.

1650
01:29:13,789 --> 01:29:14,489
Like Sanical.

1651
01:29:19,279 --> 01:29:20,079
I can't upgrade them.

1652
01:29:27,170 --> 01:29:30,399
Did I fully upgrade the acid duration?

1653
01:29:31,789 --> 01:29:32,890
What's the difference here?

1654
01:29:33,289 --> 01:29:35,989
Increased duration or increased melting duration?

1655
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:38,100
What does that mean?

1656
01:29:42,430 --> 01:29:43,899
I don't know what the difference is.

1657
01:29:49,319 --> 01:29:50,920
I feel like this is the actual damage and this isn't

1658
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:52,520
how long it sprays for.

1659
01:30:01,340 --> 01:30:02,239
Okay, I'm good.

1660
01:30:02,239 --> 01:30:05,100
I'm just going to keep shooting my bow.

1661
01:30:08,180 --> 01:30:10,979
There's also I think there's a refund all your upgrades.

1662
01:30:12,310 --> 01:30:14,010
It looks like it's some dumb choices.

1663
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:19,619
I'm doing it.

1664
01:30:20,319 --> 01:30:20,819
What are you doing?

1665
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:23,699
Oh, no, we skip.

1666
01:30:23,899 --> 01:30:24,199
Okay.

1667
01:30:24,199 --> 01:30:24,399
Nevermind.

1668
01:30:24,399 --> 01:30:25,600
I was going to refund all my upgrades.

1669
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:27,100
And we go.

1670
01:30:27,100 --> 01:30:27,800
Oh, hey, hold on.

1671
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:28,600
Lore, Lore.

1672
01:30:29,100 --> 01:30:29,500
Boss.

1673
01:30:42,489 --> 01:30:43,489
Known to all.

1674
01:30:43,489 --> 01:30:46,890
Oh, Master Cygnus taught my hero Maximilian.

1675
01:30:47,989 --> 01:30:50,689
Yes, he tried to teach your hero.

1676
01:30:51,090 --> 01:30:52,390
He was my teacher as well.

1677
01:30:52,789 --> 01:30:54,489
Didn't you turn evil for me?

1678
01:30:55,189 --> 01:30:56,189
Sorry sorceress.

1679
01:30:56,890 --> 01:30:59,989
What is not known is the story of his best friend.

1680
01:31:00,289 --> 01:31:02,090
The elf Vorwik.

1681
01:31:02,689 --> 01:31:06,689
Human and elf fought side-by-side the most talented

1682
01:31:06,689 --> 01:31:10,970
warm ages of the order before infighting forced the horde

1683
01:31:10,970 --> 01:31:12,470
into small factions.

1684
01:31:12,670 --> 01:31:16,069
They used massive traps and defeated the largest.

1685
01:31:19,270 --> 01:31:20,569
Yeah, I was taking it in.

1686
01:31:20,569 --> 01:31:22,069
Ages of their generation.

1687
01:31:22,670 --> 01:31:28,420
But when their final test came only one of them would pass.

1688
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:29,420
We're getting new characters.

1689
01:31:34,170 --> 01:31:36,770
Maybe I know you're going to want to be the elf man, right?

1690
01:31:37,069 --> 01:31:41,470
I want I like elves in like in the same way that I like cars

1691
01:31:41,470 --> 01:31:42,869
that I think they're funny and stupid.

1692
01:31:42,869 --> 01:31:50,560
They shouldn't exist pain lightning staff or short swords.

1693
01:31:51,340 --> 01:31:53,640
I don't think we're probably not going to have a choice

1694
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:54,739
and just to give us either one.

1695
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:05,720
Oh, we're in the television.

1696
01:32:05,819 --> 01:32:06,720
Oh, I was going to say that.

1697
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:09,319
Armies ever assembled.

1698
01:32:09,319 --> 01:32:10,399
I welcome it.

1699
01:32:10,399 --> 01:32:15,100
Friends sickness and thousand curious about what drives the orcs.

1700
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:17,100
You must we need to think about this.

1701
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:19,300
They're giving us 10,000.

1702
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:21,899
Oh, well, we got the you can equip the legendary stuff now.

1703
01:32:21,899 --> 01:32:23,699
Definitely stubborn.

1704
01:32:23,699 --> 01:32:25,000
Oh, perhaps right.

1705
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,600
It's not letting me drag them on nonetheless.

1706
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:28,600
You probably need to.

1707
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:30,600
Yeah, you have to like match for my strength.

1708
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:34,199
Oh, they require two slots of magic.

1709
01:32:34,199 --> 01:32:36,000
Is that what is that large amounts of enemies?

1710
01:32:37,270 --> 01:32:38,970
Maybe it is two slots.

1711
01:32:38,970 --> 01:32:41,869
It says war scenarios only, which this is.

1712
01:32:42,930 --> 01:32:45,029
Oh, they're like ultimate shift one and shift two.

1713
01:32:45,029 --> 01:32:46,130
You always have them.

1714
01:32:46,130 --> 01:32:48,029
Oh, okay.

1715
01:32:48,029 --> 01:32:49,300
I guess.

1716
01:32:49,300 --> 01:32:53,630
Well, let's what where they come from.

1717
01:32:53,630 --> 01:32:55,560
They come from here.

1718
01:32:55,560 --> 01:32:59,500
We should probably do a block scenario.

1719
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:02,779
What's the most efficient way to block this?

1720
01:33:02,779 --> 01:33:19,869
Just kind of go from here Ross or from like here to like here

1721
01:33:19,869 --> 01:33:24,720
or just wait till they get up to the stairs and just fight.

1722
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:27,220
Yeah, fight on the bridge.

1723
01:33:27,220 --> 01:33:29,420
I guess we could just fight on the bridge.

1724
01:33:29,420 --> 01:33:32,520
Do you want to follow them through just one little zone on the bridge

1725
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:39,409
like walk a couple of zones here?

1726
01:33:39,409 --> 01:33:42,489
I don't know, man.

1727
01:33:42,489 --> 01:33:45,869
It seems like a smart idea.

1728
01:33:45,869 --> 01:33:47,689
I'll do it.

1729
01:33:47,689 --> 01:33:50,090
So they have to walk through here here.

1730
01:33:50,090 --> 01:33:53,579
Okay, so then I'm going to give them with the getting with the poison.

1731
01:33:53,579 --> 01:33:58,130
Boom right here is where they will level.

1732
01:33:58,130 --> 01:34:00,720
I fucked it up is whatever.

1733
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:06,829
Oh, I see.

1734
01:34:06,829 --> 01:34:12,659
Okay, so they're going to have to cross through there

1735
01:34:12,659 --> 01:34:14,930
and then they have to cross through here.

1736
01:34:14,930 --> 01:34:16,630
Go like this.

1737
01:34:16,630 --> 01:34:20,239
No better spot than this.

1738
01:34:20,239 --> 01:34:25,149
Okay, this is an Omega launcher, right?

1739
01:34:25,149 --> 01:34:28,550
Yeah, just send them into the lava.

1740
01:34:28,550 --> 01:34:30,750
Should I put one of these down too on the other side?

1741
01:34:30,750 --> 01:34:32,149
Do you move this back a little?

1742
01:34:32,149 --> 01:34:35,060
And I'll put one going the other direction.

1743
01:34:35,060 --> 01:34:36,359
Are you how can you move things?

1744
01:34:36,359 --> 01:34:38,260
Do you sell stuff at full value?

1745
01:34:38,260 --> 01:34:40,390
Why do I got to move mine?

1746
01:34:40,390 --> 01:34:43,340
Because I we should put another one right here, right?

1747
01:34:43,340 --> 01:34:48,989
Because they'll go like this is just I think this is in the way.

1748
01:34:48,989 --> 01:34:51,689
I think this is the only place we're going to be able to put one of these

1749
01:34:51,689 --> 01:35:04,329
like lobbers because I don't I don't know like I well,

1750
01:35:04,329 --> 01:35:06,130
I wonder if we need to put I'm selling your things.

1751
01:35:06,130 --> 01:35:09,789
Why are you selling my stuff?

1752
01:35:09,789 --> 01:35:10,890
I'm snaking them.

1753
01:35:10,890 --> 01:35:13,189
Oh, you're doing like the tower defense strat.

1754
01:35:13,189 --> 01:35:22,210
Okay, we should just do that again.

1755
01:35:22,210 --> 01:35:23,810
Just pull this thing back.

1756
01:35:23,810 --> 01:35:28,800
Let's just make them do another snake.

1757
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:34,810
Then we'll go like this right here.

1758
01:35:34,810 --> 01:35:37,109
That's all I can afford right now.

1759
01:35:37,109 --> 01:35:38,409
Okay. Yeah, I'm out of money.

1760
01:35:38,409 --> 01:35:43,770
All right, let's go for it.

1761
01:35:43,770 --> 01:35:45,539
Am I okay?

1762
01:35:45,539 --> 01:35:47,310
That was weird.

1763
01:35:47,310 --> 01:35:49,609
I just did a full front flip and landed right on my back

1764
01:35:49,609 --> 01:35:51,649
and knocked the wind out of myself.

1765
01:35:51,649 --> 01:35:53,850
Waiting for a player.

1766
01:35:53,850 --> 01:35:56,909
I think it's a heel.

1767
01:35:56,909 --> 01:35:58,899
I fell.

1768
01:35:58,899 --> 01:36:03,220
What do you mean?

1769
01:36:03,220 --> 01:36:04,319
How?

1770
01:36:04,319 --> 01:36:05,220
What did you do?

1771
01:36:05,220 --> 01:36:18,449
Oh, you're good.

1772
01:36:18,449 --> 01:36:19,550
I'm coming.

1773
01:36:19,550 --> 01:36:20,750
But you fell too.

1774
01:36:20,750 --> 01:36:21,850
You jumped in.

1775
01:36:21,850 --> 01:36:24,250
Well, I just you couldn't resist because something like someone fell

1776
01:36:24,250 --> 01:36:26,159
and you had to fall in.

1777
01:36:26,260 --> 01:36:28,460
But mine was cooler than yours because I did a front flip.

1778
01:36:44,119 --> 01:36:46,319
Dude, this is like hell of a speed.

1779
01:36:46,319 --> 01:36:49,970
Oh, right.

1780
01:36:49,970 --> 01:37:02,850
What does the right click on this even do?

1781
01:37:02,850 --> 01:37:04,449
They can actually shoot at us.

1782
01:37:04,449 --> 01:37:06,050
I'm dying.

1783
01:37:06,050 --> 01:37:06,550
We'll pull back.

1784
01:37:06,550 --> 01:37:11,079
We can look at all this time we got.

1785
01:37:11,079 --> 01:37:11,779
Oh, Santa.

1786
01:37:11,779 --> 01:37:12,079
I got you.

1787
01:37:12,079 --> 01:37:23,180
I got you.

1788
01:37:23,180 --> 01:37:25,779
Okay, we both did that again.

1789
01:37:25,779 --> 01:37:26,779
All right, question.

1790
01:37:26,779 --> 01:37:30,390
Watch out, big thumper coming through.

1791
01:37:30,390 --> 01:37:32,090
I want to see him go off.

1792
01:37:32,090 --> 01:37:33,890
I want to see him go after it happens.

1793
01:37:33,890 --> 01:37:44,159
Laugh like really hard.

1794
01:37:44,159 --> 01:37:46,460
Why did it not launch it?

1795
01:37:46,460 --> 01:37:48,560
It launched one of them like a little guy.

1796
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:49,760
It did.

1797
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:53,260
Yeah, I didn't see that.

1798
01:37:53,260 --> 01:37:53,460
Okay.

1799
01:37:53,460 --> 01:37:56,359
Well, we got some orcs to kill you.

1800
01:37:56,359 --> 01:38:00,159
Oh, what can you react?

1801
01:38:00,159 --> 01:38:01,359
I didn't see anything.

1802
01:38:01,359 --> 01:38:06,470
It's not happening on my screen there.

1803
01:38:06,470 --> 01:38:09,970
They've they have reached.

1804
01:38:09,970 --> 01:38:10,970
Where are you?

1805
01:38:10,970 --> 01:38:12,069
They're in the back here.

1806
01:38:12,069 --> 01:38:13,710
They're getting through.

1807
01:38:13,710 --> 01:38:17,989
Did you see it that time?

1808
01:38:17,989 --> 01:38:21,189
This one got lost.

1809
01:38:21,189 --> 01:38:24,789
Am I the only one being a tuber?

1810
01:38:24,789 --> 01:38:25,890
I'm trying to not lose.

1811
01:38:25,890 --> 01:38:35,489
I've been they're getting through do something about it.

1812
01:38:35,489 --> 01:38:42,810
Oh, heavy orcs.

1813
01:38:42,810 --> 01:38:47,470
It's kind of reminds me playing Dynasty Warriors.

1814
01:38:47,470 --> 01:38:50,569
One time I was playing Dynasty Warriors and just running around

1815
01:38:50,569 --> 01:38:52,170
just going like this.

1816
01:38:52,170 --> 01:38:54,470
I think I'm pretty sure I fell asleep doing it and I was still

1817
01:38:54,470 --> 01:38:58,609
pressing the button.

1818
01:38:58,609 --> 01:38:59,909
Target demographic right there.

1819
01:38:59,909 --> 01:39:04,420
And I woke up and it wasn't that long.

1820
01:39:04,420 --> 01:39:08,579
Probably was like maybe five seconds 10 seconds pops.

1821
01:39:08,579 --> 01:39:10,380
All these are traps up here.

1822
01:39:10,380 --> 01:39:14,109
You can pour them.

1823
01:39:14,109 --> 01:39:15,210
I loved that game.

1824
01:39:15,210 --> 01:39:18,409
That game was so fun, especially the first few.

1825
01:39:18,409 --> 01:39:21,210
I've never actually played one really.

1826
01:39:21,210 --> 01:39:22,609
Yeah, they're rich.

1827
01:39:22,609 --> 01:39:26,210
The first two or three were awesome.

1828
01:39:26,210 --> 01:39:29,140
I especially like the other first like five.

1829
01:39:29,140 --> 01:39:29,840
Which one was the best one?

1830
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:31,039
They were always the best one.

1831
01:39:31,039 --> 01:39:33,880
Yeah, it was one of the early ones.

1832
01:39:33,979 --> 01:39:36,420
Are we keeping the same strategy gone?

1833
01:39:36,420 --> 01:39:39,039
We got more money.

1834
01:39:39,039 --> 01:39:42,140
Have you even seen this catapult shoot?

1835
01:39:42,140 --> 01:39:43,739
Do we need to do it?

1836
01:39:43,739 --> 01:39:46,250
I haven't seen it.

1837
01:39:46,250 --> 01:39:50,220
I think we might need to like tell it to fire.

1838
01:39:50,220 --> 01:39:53,020
I'm selling your stuff because they're why did you not make

1839
01:39:53,020 --> 01:39:58,810
it flush?

1840
01:39:58,810 --> 01:40:00,710
What I sold your two things.

1841
01:40:00,710 --> 01:40:02,640
You didn't make it flush.

1842
01:40:02,640 --> 01:40:07,039
I didn't flush it was not was an efficient use.

1843
01:40:07,039 --> 01:40:07,739
Oh, okay.

1844
01:40:07,739 --> 01:40:12,680
I built them in a panic because I can hop.

1845
01:40:12,779 --> 01:40:14,779
In this and use this thing.

1846
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:22,220
I must feel like we should sell the launcher and just make

1847
01:40:22,220 --> 01:40:23,319
a longer s.

1848
01:40:23,619 --> 01:40:25,319
Yeah, honestly, I feel like that thing is not helping us

1849
01:40:25,319 --> 01:40:25,819
that much.

1850
01:40:26,890 --> 01:40:29,090
Have you used this thing one that I'm in this big like

1851
01:40:29,189 --> 01:40:29,789
cannon thing?

1852
01:40:30,189 --> 01:40:31,789
No, don't sell my can.

1853
01:40:31,789 --> 01:40:32,390
I want it.

1854
01:40:32,489 --> 01:40:33,590
Oh you that's what I mean.

1855
01:40:33,590 --> 01:40:34,289
You can sit in it.

1856
01:40:34,289 --> 01:40:37,859
Okay, you have to actually used it once launcher is strong.

1857
01:40:38,260 --> 01:40:40,659
How can we why we not doing it right?

1858
01:40:41,960 --> 01:40:42,460
I don't know.

1859
01:40:42,460 --> 01:40:44,060
I think it's like a you problem.

1860
01:40:44,659 --> 01:40:46,960
He's being such an affliction warlock right now.

1861
01:40:49,270 --> 01:40:51,069
Me or who I don't know.

1862
01:40:51,069 --> 01:40:51,970
I just read it.

1863
01:40:54,060 --> 01:40:54,859
What does that mean?

1864
01:40:58,029 --> 01:40:59,329
Can you catapult them from there?

1865
01:40:59,329 --> 01:41:02,430
I can take a look watch this.

1866
01:41:03,369 --> 01:41:07,869
Oh, dude, this is just like Helm's deep.

1867
01:41:07,869 --> 01:41:09,170
What a view you got.

1868
01:41:09,170 --> 01:41:10,470
What a view you got.

1869
01:41:13,010 --> 01:41:13,210
All right.

1870
01:41:13,210 --> 01:41:14,510
These things are actually amazing.

1871
01:41:14,810 --> 01:41:17,609
That's gonna mentally scar me for years definitely should

1872
01:41:17,609 --> 01:41:19,409
make more of these because we could just we could sit

1873
01:41:19,409 --> 01:41:20,109
back and do this.

1874
01:41:37,409 --> 01:41:38,409
All right big guy coming in.

1875
01:41:44,659 --> 01:41:46,659
I hope this doesn't hurt our stuff.

1876
01:41:46,760 --> 01:41:47,460
Let's find out.

1877
01:41:48,939 --> 01:41:51,539
Is that like hurting my hurting like the doesn't look like

1878
01:41:51,539 --> 01:41:54,239
it did because this is this is a crazy amount of damage.

1879
01:41:59,239 --> 01:42:01,140
Honestly, we just put two of these side by side and hang

1880
01:42:01,140 --> 01:42:01,439
out.

1881
01:42:08,180 --> 01:42:08,380
Okay.

1882
01:42:08,380 --> 01:42:09,479
Would you got the money for one?

1883
01:42:10,779 --> 01:42:11,880
Not yet.

1884
01:42:12,779 --> 01:42:13,479
We will soon.

1885
01:42:14,640 --> 01:42:26,399
Yeah, you're cheating starting to get through.

1886
01:42:31,279 --> 01:42:32,979
Is that a ultimate or something you're doing?

1887
01:42:33,880 --> 01:42:36,479
That was the right click of the staff calls down a bunch

1888
01:42:36,479 --> 01:42:38,460
of beam.

1889
01:42:40,210 --> 01:42:41,609
It does use some mana.

1890
01:42:44,220 --> 01:42:45,619
Are those things cost 3000?

1891
01:42:48,619 --> 01:42:49,220
I'm on it.

1892
01:42:50,319 --> 01:42:51,020
I'm getting through.

1893
01:42:52,020 --> 01:42:53,619
I'm on it boss.

1894
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:10,600
I have enough money to make another one.

1895
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:12,399
I'm going to get out and I'm going to make you one.

1896
01:43:15,550 --> 01:43:15,949
Okay.

1897
01:43:20,060 --> 01:43:20,359
All right.

1898
01:43:26,890 --> 01:43:27,390
You good.

1899
01:43:27,890 --> 01:43:29,590
I'm dealing with these ogres.

1900
01:43:29,789 --> 01:43:30,289
I'm good.

1901
01:43:31,189 --> 01:43:32,689
Focus on yourself for one.

1902
01:43:36,380 --> 01:43:37,180
Is it too close?

1903
01:43:40,170 --> 01:43:41,069
I think it's a good spot.

1904
01:43:41,979 --> 01:43:48,060
Well, I still have let me do this too close.

1905
01:43:52,380 --> 01:43:53,680
Should I put it back like here?

1906
01:43:55,750 --> 01:43:58,149
But he can't he won't be able to see there's there's a

1907
01:43:58,149 --> 01:44:00,649
whole other platform back on the other side where we can

1908
01:44:00,649 --> 01:44:02,550
like kill all the guys in the beginning.

1909
01:44:03,810 --> 01:44:06,210
You know, I wish they put the big launcher then.

1910
01:44:06,710 --> 01:44:10,510
But over but over but over but over here but over here

1911
01:44:10,810 --> 01:44:13,010
but over here because we should just be double like

1912
01:44:13,010 --> 01:44:14,510
double teaming with these.

1913
01:44:14,510 --> 01:44:16,310
Yeah, I'll double team with you anytime.

1914
01:44:16,310 --> 01:44:17,409
Let's fucking go put it here.

1915
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:21,600
Wait, it's I can't I gotta make sure it's the right way.

1916
01:44:21,699 --> 01:44:27,050
But it but it has to be like here because they won't

1917
01:44:27,050 --> 01:44:28,649
hear can't aim in the right direction.

1918
01:44:28,649 --> 01:44:29,149
Do you want this one?

1919
01:44:29,149 --> 01:44:29,949
Do you want the one on the bridge?

1920
01:44:30,250 --> 01:44:30,949
I want this one.

1921
01:44:31,250 --> 01:44:31,649
All right.

1922
01:44:33,220 --> 01:44:33,619
Let's go.

1923
01:44:33,619 --> 01:44:34,119
I'm ready.

1924
01:44:34,720 --> 01:44:38,319
What's your highest score in Papa's freeze area and

1925
01:44:38,319 --> 01:44:40,619
Papa's freeze area?

1926
01:44:42,590 --> 01:44:53,079
What more coin did I not speak clearly what pay attention

1927
01:44:53,079 --> 01:44:54,380
we have to get the book.

1928
01:44:55,899 --> 01:44:57,000
I'm paying attention.

1929
01:45:03,960 --> 01:45:05,460
How many people can play this at the same time?

1930
01:45:06,760 --> 01:45:07,859
I think 64.

1931
01:45:11,819 --> 01:45:12,319
It's not fair.

1932
01:45:12,319 --> 01:45:13,420
You can actually hit them from there.

1933
01:45:29,659 --> 01:45:29,960
All right.

1934
01:45:30,260 --> 01:45:32,260
It's almost time to put your attention on to the bridge.

1935
01:45:33,430 --> 01:45:36,229
Wait, one of them got knocked all the way up here to me.

1936
01:45:39,220 --> 01:45:40,119
It's time to focus on the bridge.

1937
01:45:40,119 --> 01:45:42,720
We got five big guys about to come through.

1938
01:45:44,920 --> 01:45:52,390
Okay, how are they getting up here?

1939
01:45:52,989 --> 01:45:53,489
I don't know.

1940
01:45:54,739 --> 01:45:57,039
I think we're getting launched here by the other launcher

1941
01:45:57,640 --> 01:45:58,539
little little.

1942
01:45:58,640 --> 01:46:00,439
Oh, I got him.

1943
01:46:00,439 --> 01:46:00,939
Oh, you're good.

1944
01:46:06,859 --> 01:46:07,960
Yeah, they are getting launched.

1945
01:46:09,090 --> 01:46:11,689
Dude, that thing I think is launching them the thing behind

1946
01:46:11,689 --> 01:46:11,989
us.

1947
01:46:12,390 --> 01:46:14,390
Yeah, it's it's launching them the whole way.

1948
01:46:14,390 --> 01:46:15,189
I'm going to go sell it.

1949
01:46:19,779 --> 01:46:20,579
I can't sell it.

1950
01:46:22,920 --> 01:46:24,420
Whoever built that's a moron.

1951
01:46:30,640 --> 01:46:31,439
They're overwhelming us.

1952
01:46:35,479 --> 01:46:35,979
Nice.

1953
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:46,260
I got him.

1954
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:48,060
That's that's the guys getting launched over.

1955
01:47:05,960 --> 01:47:07,260
Where's the fan art?

1956
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:08,560
Oh, it's the title.

1957
01:47:09,460 --> 01:47:10,960
Where's the thunder?

1958
01:47:13,340 --> 01:47:14,539
You know what I'm talking about?

1959
01:47:14,640 --> 01:47:17,239
Hey guys, I need you to focus up.

1960
01:47:17,239 --> 01:47:18,840
We got five big guys coming in.

1961
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:19,539
Focus up.

1962
01:47:22,979 --> 01:47:23,380
Coming.

1963
01:47:23,479 --> 01:47:24,180
I'm coming to help.

1964
01:47:35,710 --> 01:47:36,109
How?

1965
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:39,199
How?

1966
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:40,199
How?

1967
01:47:42,229 --> 01:47:42,829
Stop.

1968
01:47:53,100 --> 01:47:54,000
Dude, I'm gaming.

1969
01:47:54,199 --> 01:47:55,699
I have never reached this level.

1970
01:47:57,350 --> 01:47:58,149
What's your favorite game?

1971
01:48:00,109 --> 01:48:03,109
Dude, we've had this conversation and we just agree every time.

1972
01:48:03,409 --> 01:48:04,109
Isn't that boring?

1973
01:48:05,310 --> 01:48:10,409
It's like Diablo 2 Bloodborne, but actually it's Path of Exile.

1974
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:13,100
Name me your top 10 games.

1975
01:48:13,100 --> 01:48:14,300
Do you think you are your favorites?

1976
01:48:15,310 --> 01:48:16,310
That's too hard.

1977
01:48:17,310 --> 01:48:20,010
I'm going to be thinking for like hours before I say some stupid shit

1978
01:48:20,010 --> 01:48:22,109
that I'm going to regret that everyone's going to quote me for years

1979
01:48:22,109 --> 01:48:24,510
because I said this one time on the stream stream that I said like

1980
01:48:25,310 --> 01:48:27,409
at my little pony ponies are forever is like my favorite.

1981
01:48:30,270 --> 01:48:33,670
Can you slowly tell me about what you had for breakfast this morning?

1982
01:48:34,479 --> 01:48:37,180
Slowly like very slow like do you have a little

1983
01:48:38,180 --> 01:48:51,239
Left over Jersey Mike's sandwich with some milk.

1984
01:49:02,100 --> 01:49:02,699
All right.

1985
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:09,890
Wait, you drank you just you had a sub with milk.

1986
01:49:12,989 --> 01:49:13,890
You shut the fuck up.

1987
01:49:13,989 --> 01:49:15,289
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1988
01:49:15,989 --> 01:49:17,989
What about my eating habits?

1989
01:49:18,189 --> 01:49:20,489
Oh dude, blue cheese is gross, man.

1990
01:49:20,489 --> 01:49:21,189
Fuck you.

1991
01:49:22,090 --> 01:49:25,390
Milk with a sub was muscle milk.

1992
01:49:27,640 --> 01:49:28,840
So I think that gives it a pass.

1993
01:49:29,539 --> 01:49:30,439
Yeah, I guess so.

1994
01:49:32,140 --> 01:49:32,939
Why don't I just do that?

1995
01:49:35,390 --> 01:49:35,590
All right.

1996
01:49:35,590 --> 01:49:37,590
Do what we need to figure out.

1997
01:49:38,289 --> 01:49:39,189
They're going to breach this.

1998
01:49:39,489 --> 01:49:44,520
So do we want them going around here like through here?

1999
01:49:44,520 --> 01:49:45,819
No, don't do that.

2000
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:48,020
Look, you can you can pour these.

2001
01:49:49,090 --> 01:49:49,289
Okay.

2002
01:49:49,289 --> 01:49:49,989
Well, then we want it.

2003
01:49:49,989 --> 01:49:50,789
We want it over here.

2004
01:49:51,390 --> 01:49:53,090
No, because there's one on each side.

2005
01:49:54,439 --> 01:49:54,739
Okay.

2006
01:49:54,739 --> 01:49:57,140
Well, then we don't need it and then we need to figure out what to do

2007
01:49:57,140 --> 01:49:59,739
after they get through that my god, then maybe we should put some

2008
01:49:59,739 --> 01:50:00,939
tar down there.

2009
01:50:00,939 --> 01:50:03,939
Maybe we should go like this so we can start the snake again.

2010
01:50:09,119 --> 01:50:10,420
Is that are you okay with that?

2011
01:50:10,420 --> 01:50:12,119
So then they have to sign with that.

2012
01:50:14,500 --> 01:50:14,800
All right.

2013
01:50:14,899 --> 01:50:15,500
Go ready.

2014
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:16,899
Get in your launcher.

2015
01:50:32,050 --> 01:50:34,149
When we're hitting these guys are getting like a hellwork

2016
01:50:34,149 --> 01:50:35,750
pack word logo.

2017
01:50:36,149 --> 01:50:36,850
Like what is this?

2018
01:50:37,649 --> 01:50:40,750
I honestly don't even know what words you just said.

2019
01:50:42,739 --> 01:50:49,560
Hey, what logo they make like printers and Hewlett Packard.

2020
01:50:50,359 --> 01:50:50,960
Something like that.

2021
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:51,960
Yeah, Hewlett Packard.

2022
01:50:51,960 --> 01:50:52,760
What did you say?

2023
01:50:54,460 --> 01:50:54,960
I don't know.

2024
01:50:56,539 --> 01:50:57,340
Hell wart.

2025
01:50:58,239 --> 01:50:59,239
What did you say?

2026
01:51:00,380 --> 01:51:02,079
Hell, hell work Packard.

2027
01:51:02,680 --> 01:51:03,579
Hell, I don't even know.

2028
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:06,979
I don't even know what I'm you.

2029
01:51:07,380 --> 01:51:08,479
Are you shooting your bombs?

2030
01:51:08,680 --> 01:51:09,279
I am.

2031
01:51:09,279 --> 01:51:10,279
I'm focusing on the bridge.

2032
01:51:12,899 --> 01:51:13,800
That didn't even hurt anybody.

2033
01:51:13,800 --> 01:51:14,199
What?

2034
01:51:14,199 --> 01:51:14,399
Okay.

2035
01:51:14,399 --> 01:51:15,899
Well, there's a lot of guys on the bridge.

2036
01:51:19,939 --> 01:51:20,840
Oh goodness.

2037
01:51:21,619 --> 01:51:23,619
Oh my goodness under control.

2038
01:51:27,260 --> 01:51:29,159
One little guy getting through nothing to do about it.

2039
01:51:42,859 --> 01:51:47,409
How do I do this?

2040
01:51:47,409 --> 01:52:02,180
How do I do this here in my mouth?

2041
01:52:06,060 --> 01:52:09,060
Dude, do we get do we get like an end of the game scorecard?

2042
01:52:10,659 --> 01:52:14,689
We get to compare each other and see who is more valuable.

2043
01:52:17,140 --> 01:52:20,140
Possible general electric logo.

2044
01:52:20,239 --> 01:52:21,039
Is that what it is?

2045
01:52:23,079 --> 01:52:23,979
That looks more like.

2046
01:52:48,060 --> 01:52:52,699
Oh, don't worry.

2047
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:53,500
I've got you.

2048
01:52:53,699 --> 01:53:07,239
I'm clicking left click now.

2049
01:53:10,319 --> 01:53:11,520
Oh, you've launched one off.

2050
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:11,920
Nice.

2051
01:53:18,079 --> 01:53:19,380
All right, this is the last wave.

2052
01:53:23,029 --> 01:53:24,529
All the orcs sound like bugleberry.

2053
01:53:34,210 --> 01:53:34,909
This is too big.

2054
01:53:34,909 --> 01:53:35,909
You can't put anything down.

2055
01:53:35,909 --> 01:53:37,909
So I guess we're just going to do.

2056
01:53:47,180 --> 01:53:51,079
I think I'm going to upgrade the slow trap thing.

2057
01:53:51,579 --> 01:53:53,479
I feel like it's really useful and with any points in it.

2058
01:53:53,479 --> 01:53:54,279
It'd be way down.

2059
01:53:55,859 --> 01:53:56,960
I'm liking the slow.

2060
01:54:05,170 --> 01:54:06,470
I'm just I'm just ready.

2061
01:54:08,770 --> 01:54:12,539
I don't I don't think these things are even a threat.

2062
01:54:12,539 --> 01:54:18,100
He's things innovating our castle.

2063
01:54:19,199 --> 01:54:19,500
Oh shit.

2064
01:54:19,500 --> 01:54:20,300
It's crack.

2065
01:54:21,010 --> 01:54:23,010
Crag has shown up to fight.

2066
01:54:23,609 --> 01:54:26,439
We should remove him quick.

2067
01:54:26,439 --> 01:54:27,640
Sable the traps.

2068
01:54:28,270 --> 01:54:31,380
Should we just go right and kill that thing right now?

2069
01:54:35,079 --> 01:54:38,380
Yeah, maybe we're kind of just going to let him walk all the way up here.

2070
01:54:38,479 --> 01:54:41,380
I'm aiming at him and I'm aiming my bombs.

2071
01:54:42,180 --> 01:54:42,779
I don't even know.

2072
01:54:42,779 --> 01:54:43,680
He's right there.

2073
01:54:43,979 --> 01:54:44,579
I missed.

2074
01:54:44,579 --> 01:54:45,279
I'm missing.

2075
01:54:46,079 --> 01:54:46,779
I got a direct hit.

2076
01:54:49,869 --> 01:54:51,670
Oh, he's he destroyed our thing.

2077
01:54:54,050 --> 01:54:55,250
Okay, I'm going to go fight Craig.

2078
01:54:55,750 --> 01:54:59,350
I will handle the enemies that come up through here and try to get through

2079
01:54:59,350 --> 01:54:59,850
the bridge.

2080
01:55:00,250 --> 01:55:01,050
You handle crack.

2081
01:55:07,210 --> 01:55:08,109
Crag is incoming.

2082
01:55:10,619 --> 01:55:11,920
Can we start bombing Crag?

2083
01:55:12,689 --> 01:55:19,960
I am hard to get in here with all these boogers.

2084
01:55:21,060 --> 01:55:22,760
I am currently bombing Crag.

2085
01:55:26,649 --> 01:55:32,869
People getting through no one important point enough for our perfect rating.

2086
01:55:36,510 --> 01:55:37,010
Four.

2087
01:55:37,810 --> 01:55:38,409
Yes.

2088
01:55:39,409 --> 01:55:39,810
Nice.

2089
01:55:48,420 --> 01:55:51,020
Okay, we got a we got a whole situation here pal.

2090
01:56:00,260 --> 01:56:01,159
That was actually kind of fun.

2091
01:56:04,619 --> 01:56:05,619
You got the heal thing.

2092
01:56:06,020 --> 01:56:06,720
I do.

2093
01:56:11,880 --> 01:56:13,779
You've got to be trolling mate.

2094
01:56:15,659 --> 01:56:16,560
They're gonna get through the gate.

2095
01:56:25,199 --> 01:56:28,699
I think I think if you just deal with those guys, I keep bombing.

2096
01:56:30,189 --> 01:56:31,189
I will try.

2097
01:56:33,119 --> 01:56:34,319
I think I upgraded this thing.

2098
01:56:35,119 --> 01:56:35,920
Upgrade it.

2099
01:56:40,250 --> 01:56:40,649
All right.

2100
01:56:41,420 --> 01:56:42,520
They are all done.

2101
01:56:42,619 --> 01:56:44,220
All the ones that got by are killed.

2102
01:56:45,649 --> 01:56:47,850
I can now make my way in front of you.

2103
01:56:49,270 --> 01:56:57,260
Clean up this walking off the edge and dying.

2104
01:56:59,409 --> 01:57:01,310
Why is there pathing making them go walk up?

2105
01:57:01,409 --> 01:57:05,609
No, I think that's there's the thing that's boosting them down there.

2106
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:19,960
Have you noticed this is kind of just like home deep?

2107
01:57:21,539 --> 01:57:22,840
I think that's kind of the idea.

2108
01:57:24,140 --> 01:57:24,939
Inspiration.

2109
01:57:27,710 --> 01:57:30,340
What I think that's kind of the idea.

2110
01:57:30,340 --> 01:57:34,939
It seems like inspired by big, you know, one of the rings type stuff.

2111
01:57:35,439 --> 01:57:37,340
Okay, there's no ladders or anything.

2112
01:57:40,520 --> 01:57:41,420
That's a five-star.

2113
01:57:44,590 --> 01:57:45,189
Perfect.

2114
01:57:47,470 --> 01:57:49,270
All castles must be Helm's deep.

2115
01:57:49,569 --> 01:57:51,569
Yeah, I'm a five-star man.

2116
01:57:54,750 --> 01:57:56,449
All right, the tar trap.

2117
01:57:56,550 --> 01:57:58,250
This is good increases slow.

2118
01:57:58,250 --> 01:58:00,649
Absolutely more more.

2119
01:58:02,140 --> 01:58:04,039
I just put all my points into this.

2120
01:58:04,239 --> 01:58:06,640
So this thing's gonna be amazing.

2121
01:58:07,970 --> 01:58:09,670
I remember the ice amulet being cool.

2122
01:58:13,250 --> 01:58:15,350
I think we can probably swap for heroes now.

2123
01:58:24,899 --> 01:58:27,600
How many orcs does it take to break into this fucking base?

2124
01:58:27,800 --> 01:58:30,199
Why do they keep doing the same strategy?

2125
01:58:31,649 --> 01:58:32,449
Yeah, it's true.

2126
01:58:32,649 --> 01:58:38,750
You think that after like a thousand years orcs wouldn't just walk out of building anymore.

2127
01:58:38,850 --> 01:58:43,250
You think that they would develop some new type of way to attack a base or something?

2128
01:58:45,220 --> 01:58:46,819
Yeah, the walk at structure.

2129
01:58:46,819 --> 01:58:47,819
I don't think that's fair.

2130
01:58:48,920 --> 01:58:50,520
Every orc only gets to try once.

2131
01:58:52,899 --> 01:58:53,800
How are they gonna learn?

2132
01:58:55,920 --> 01:58:59,119
Well, that's what I'm saying that all the orcs collectively have not learned

2133
01:58:59,619 --> 01:59:04,319
that walking with a big sword or a big club is the way to do it.

2134
01:59:19,130 --> 01:59:20,329
Yeah, what is all this new stuff?

2135
01:59:26,130 --> 01:59:26,829
Orcs.

2136
01:59:27,729 --> 01:59:31,529
Hello, are we not going to talk about how this warwick guy is clearly in love with the

2137
01:59:31,529 --> 01:59:33,630
long-range multi shot ice attack?

2138
01:59:34,920 --> 01:59:35,520
No, that's me.

2139
01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:36,420
You can't copy me.

2140
01:59:37,319 --> 01:59:38,220
I'm playing ice shot.

2141
01:59:41,699 --> 01:59:48,779
Okay, this was Earthling weak against arcane and ice wrong against physical damage.

2142
01:59:56,960 --> 01:59:57,859
I like this loadout.

2143
02:00:02,460 --> 02:00:03,359
I can't shoot that fast.

2144
02:00:03,359 --> 02:00:03,859
It's not fair.

2145
02:00:05,470 --> 02:00:05,670
Yeah.

2146
02:00:05,670 --> 02:00:07,369
Well, maybe you need to get the upgrades.

2147
02:00:07,470 --> 02:00:09,770
Why did we I didn't we didn't put why did we both press the button?

2148
02:00:10,369 --> 02:00:11,270
I press the button.

2149
02:00:13,750 --> 02:00:14,550
I'm not scared.

2150
02:00:14,850 --> 02:00:17,649
I think this is we just if we just defended Helms deep.

2151
02:00:24,510 --> 02:00:25,609
I wonder how much the slowest now.

2152
02:00:27,100 --> 02:00:28,600
Wow, it even freezes them.

2153
02:00:32,579 --> 02:00:33,579
I think it freezes him now.

2154
02:00:34,770 --> 02:00:35,770
That was me using.

2155
02:00:35,869 --> 02:00:37,670
Oh shit.

2156
02:00:38,270 --> 02:00:39,970
Oh, yeah.

2157
02:00:40,770 --> 02:00:42,069
Oh wow.

2158
02:00:42,369 --> 02:00:42,869
You're right.

2159
02:00:42,869 --> 02:00:44,170
Oh dang it.

2160
02:00:52,840 --> 02:00:53,439
Oh, yeah.

2161
02:00:57,869 --> 02:00:59,369
Oh wait.

2162
02:01:00,850 --> 02:01:01,750
Are you freezing them?

2163
02:01:03,300 --> 02:01:04,600
No, that's you doing.

2164
02:01:05,300 --> 02:01:07,100
Oh, you're absolutely doing that.

2165
02:01:14,250 --> 02:01:15,350
That was a pretty good impression.

2166
02:01:16,050 --> 02:01:17,350
I think I could do a pretty good bugleberry.

2167
02:01:20,859 --> 02:01:21,659
Oh, yes.

2168
02:01:23,470 --> 02:01:25,069
Better than how many cards you have.

2169
02:01:25,670 --> 02:01:26,470
I think that's pretty close.

2170
02:01:37,770 --> 02:01:40,310
You want to be in charge of building the block?

2171
02:01:41,630 --> 02:01:43,529
Yeah, I'll just I'm just building barricades.

2172
02:01:48,880 --> 02:01:49,979
Actually, let me complete it.

2173
02:01:50,579 --> 02:01:52,180
All right, probably a good idea.

2174
02:01:53,079 --> 02:01:53,979
I'm out of money.

2175
02:01:55,399 --> 02:01:56,399
All right, I got some cash.

2176
02:01:57,300 --> 02:01:58,699
Do you think you could drink this slime?

2177
02:02:00,100 --> 02:02:00,699
Might kill you.

2178
02:02:15,460 --> 02:02:16,659
The Earth Lord.

2179
02:02:18,260 --> 02:02:18,760
Watch out.

2180
02:02:19,159 --> 02:02:20,060
It's an Earth Lord.

2181
02:02:23,239 --> 02:02:24,340
Oh, no.

2182
02:02:26,420 --> 02:02:28,119
Oh, no.

2183
02:02:28,920 --> 02:02:41,289
Oh, no.

2184
02:02:51,350 --> 02:02:54,250
But you you knew you were doing this because you were shooting at people.

2185
02:02:54,949 --> 02:02:55,350
Yeah.

2186
02:02:55,449 --> 02:02:57,050
Oh, you were messing around with me.

2187
02:02:58,430 --> 02:02:59,329
That thing's actually kind of fun.

2188
02:03:04,260 --> 02:03:07,760
It's got like, you know, like a ice floor Nova, too.

2189
02:03:07,960 --> 02:03:08,359
Yeah.

2190
02:03:08,560 --> 02:03:11,460
I remember from the older games being like one of the best things you could get.

2191
02:03:12,159 --> 02:03:14,060
Yeah, that's why I'm free some work.

2192
02:03:14,359 --> 02:03:14,760
Yeah.

2193
02:03:16,479 --> 02:03:17,880
I'm usually like the ice guy.

2194
02:03:17,979 --> 02:03:20,130
So like how are you doing that?

2195
02:03:20,229 --> 02:03:21,229
You can do like fire or something.

2196
02:03:21,229 --> 02:03:22,829
You're like a you're just like the fire guy.

2197
02:03:22,829 --> 02:03:23,930
I mean like I are okay.

2198
02:03:23,930 --> 02:03:25,930
We're gonna have to I'm gonna have to refund all my upgrades.

2199
02:03:26,329 --> 02:03:29,130
I mean, you know, I'm like usually like ice like I like like ice chill

2200
02:03:29,130 --> 02:03:33,399
and water and I usually I'm gonna be ice.

2201
02:03:33,399 --> 02:03:36,000
I think I don't think I don't think that's actually true.

2202
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:40,800
But you do if you if you need to pick an elemental wizard, honest honest,

2203
02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:43,800
you're you're joking about being an ice person.

2204
02:03:44,800 --> 02:03:50,119
What is your elemental wizard casting bowling balls?

2205
02:03:52,090 --> 02:03:53,090
Also, you're an earth vendor.

2206
02:03:54,319 --> 02:03:58,829
Oh, I'm a bowling ball vendor and bowling balls are made of earth.

2207
02:03:59,989 --> 02:04:03,789
Bowling balls are made out of a synthetic material.

2208
02:04:03,989 --> 02:04:06,789
You know, you know, listen to this, you know, do you know that bowling balls?

2209
02:04:06,789 --> 02:04:10,590
I'm gonna fucking blow everybody's mind that has not seen that one YouTube video.

2210
02:04:11,390 --> 02:04:13,689
Okay, do you know when you think of a bowling ball?

2211
02:04:13,689 --> 02:04:14,789
What what is a bowling ball?

2212
02:04:14,789 --> 02:04:15,590
Like what is it?

2213
02:04:15,789 --> 02:04:17,789
It's just like a big ball, right?

2214
02:04:18,189 --> 02:04:18,590
Yeah.

2215
02:04:19,189 --> 02:04:20,890
No, there is shit.

2216
02:04:22,390 --> 02:04:23,689
Let me fucking talk.

2217
02:04:24,489 --> 02:04:27,789
There is there's shit in the middle of a bowling ball.

2218
02:04:28,859 --> 02:04:29,760
There's a core.

2219
02:04:29,859 --> 02:04:34,659
There is a bowling ball core that is different for every bowling ball.

2220
02:04:35,430 --> 02:04:40,130
It's like this weird metal core that's weirdly shaped depending on what kind of ball you want.

2221
02:04:42,829 --> 02:04:43,930
It's crazy.

2222
02:04:44,029 --> 02:04:44,729
I did not know that.

2223
02:04:44,729 --> 02:04:48,130
I thought it was just a big ball of like like plastic or whatever.

2224
02:04:48,130 --> 02:04:49,430
They are next.

2225
02:04:49,430 --> 02:04:54,729
Next thing you're going to tell me is that there isn't like an under dark to the earth

2226
02:04:55,029 --> 02:05:01,350
and that there's also an earth core literally incorrect.

2227
02:05:01,350 --> 02:05:03,050
I work at a bowling ball manufacturer.

2228
02:05:03,050 --> 02:05:04,250
You must not be paying attention then.

2229
02:05:05,050 --> 02:05:07,750
That's what's inside a bowling ball has a like a core in the middle.

2230
02:05:11,130 --> 02:05:16,050
Do we want to make it so they have to go through here really stuff them in here?

2231
02:05:23,989 --> 02:05:25,590
That's only for the pro ones.

2232
02:05:27,100 --> 02:05:31,600
Yeah, but you're not you're not good enough to use those when we said apologize to stir.

2233
02:05:31,600 --> 02:05:41,859
What why I don't know why but you probably owe me one.

2234
02:05:45,479 --> 02:05:47,579
Oh, it's because I said like what I say like shut up.

2235
02:05:47,579 --> 02:05:48,479
I'm talking or something.

2236
02:05:52,430 --> 02:05:52,729
Shut up.

2237
02:05:52,729 --> 02:05:54,630
You're going to want to hear about the bowling ball.

2238
02:05:55,130 --> 02:05:56,329
Bowling ball facts.

2239
02:05:56,329 --> 02:05:57,930
I'm so much smarter than everybody.

2240
02:05:58,430 --> 02:06:00,829
I thought what was in the center of a bowling ball was your fingers.

2241
02:06:02,930 --> 02:06:03,630
Now that's drilled in.

2242
02:06:05,630 --> 02:06:09,630
Well, yeah, because you like if you got like really long fingers and your fingers

2243
02:06:09,630 --> 02:06:15,060
are going to the core and then you're probably going to have to off balance

2244
02:06:16,159 --> 02:06:26,520
the holes that are on one side only the pro bowling balls.

2245
02:06:27,489 --> 02:06:27,789
Yeah.

2246
02:06:27,789 --> 02:06:31,289
Well, it's in bowling balls, but it's all that's not even true.

2247
02:06:45,510 --> 02:06:46,710
I feel like we're the bad guys.

2248
02:06:47,210 --> 02:06:50,310
I felt cool killing the orcs because they're like made in a vat

2249
02:06:50,310 --> 02:06:52,010
and they don't even really have true sentines.

2250
02:06:52,310 --> 02:06:55,010
But as soon as like earth elementals were against this is like,

2251
02:06:55,010 --> 02:06:57,810
okay, the earth is is not okay with what we're doing.

2252
02:06:57,810 --> 02:06:58,710
That's true.

2253
02:06:58,710 --> 02:07:01,109
We it was the actual orcs.

2254
02:07:03,109 --> 02:07:05,010
Yeah, it's not works must die.

2255
02:07:05,310 --> 02:07:07,210
And also the soul of the earth.

2256
02:07:09,010 --> 02:07:09,909
That's true.

2257
02:07:09,909 --> 02:07:12,609
Also, the soul of the earth is a problem.

2258
02:07:24,119 --> 02:07:24,720
Wrong side.

2259
02:07:32,119 --> 02:07:35,720
Another mind blowing fact, the Earth's core has mountains in it.

2260
02:07:36,319 --> 02:07:40,979
What?

2261
02:07:41,920 --> 02:07:50,710
Oh, the Earth's core has huge lumpy mountains apparently inside of it.

2262
02:07:52,479 --> 02:07:54,079
What are they planning in there?

2263
02:07:54,079 --> 02:07:58,479
If we if we keep talking about weird facts, none of us really know anything about

2264
02:07:58,479 --> 02:08:00,279
this is going to be a Joe Rogan podcast.

2265
02:08:00,279 --> 02:08:03,279
Wait, wait, you're telling me what?

2266
02:08:03,880 --> 02:08:05,180
There's what in the earth?

2267
02:08:05,180 --> 02:08:07,779
Nobody said mountains are a liberal lie.

2268
02:08:13,880 --> 02:08:14,779
Changes everything.

2269
02:08:14,779 --> 02:08:15,979
I knew about the earth.

2270
02:08:20,409 --> 02:08:21,010
What the hell is it?

2271
02:08:21,010 --> 02:08:22,710
What the hell is even in the core of the earth?

2272
02:08:24,100 --> 02:08:24,699
Isn't it like?

2273
02:08:31,890 --> 02:08:33,989
Would you be surprised if there was a fucking Duncan in them?

2274
02:08:33,989 --> 02:08:34,289
All right.

2275
02:08:34,289 --> 02:08:34,890
Hold on.

2276
02:08:36,489 --> 02:08:37,689
I got to help Duncan.

2277
02:08:54,949 --> 02:08:58,819
You think earth splatter or are you into the fruit roll-up model?

2278
02:09:02,130 --> 02:09:03,229
Root roll-up.

2279
02:09:03,729 --> 02:09:05,430
Yeah, it's like the earth is flat.

2280
02:09:05,430 --> 02:09:08,229
What is actually rolled up on top of it felt like a fruit roll-up.

2281
02:09:11,920 --> 02:09:13,520
I think the bigger question to ask.

2282
02:09:14,220 --> 02:09:15,720
It's like, I don't know.

2283
02:09:15,720 --> 02:09:17,720
Don't you think it's kind of ridiculous?

2284
02:09:18,020 --> 02:09:22,619
It's ridiculous like how plants function like how we put these things

2285
02:09:22,619 --> 02:09:25,319
in the ground to become these gigantic fucking monstrous things.

2286
02:09:25,720 --> 02:09:26,420
That's ridiculous.

2287
02:09:26,420 --> 02:09:26,720
Isn't it?

2288
02:09:26,720 --> 02:09:27,619
Isn't that like kind of crazy?

2289
02:09:28,859 --> 02:09:31,359
I wholeheartedly and completely agree.

2290
02:09:31,859 --> 02:09:36,560
Plants are fucked up and anyone who's doubting it is like these things.

2291
02:09:37,060 --> 02:09:38,659
Okay, so you're telling me they're alive.

2292
02:09:38,960 --> 02:09:43,060
They live for hundreds of years like thousands of years like the

2293
02:09:43,060 --> 02:09:46,859
great redwood oaks and shit that are like true drive a car through

2294
02:09:46,859 --> 02:09:53,279
these fucking things and they're just they're just living through.

2295
02:10:02,130 --> 02:10:07,829
Yeah, it's so it's so growing sunflowers kind of really changed

2296
02:10:07,829 --> 02:10:09,229
my view of everything.

2297
02:10:09,329 --> 02:10:09,930
It's kind of funny.

2298
02:10:10,130 --> 02:10:10,829
It's some serious.

2299
02:10:11,529 --> 02:10:11,930
Okay.

2300
02:10:12,029 --> 02:10:12,529
Okay.

2301
02:10:14,329 --> 02:10:14,729
Hold on.

2302
02:10:14,729 --> 02:10:18,229
Let me let me let me call it wasn't laughing at sunflowers changing

2303
02:10:18,229 --> 02:10:19,529
your perspective of reality.

2304
02:10:19,529 --> 02:10:21,729
You put like something funny happened in the game.

2305
02:10:21,729 --> 02:10:27,130
You put one seed in the ground and this thing grows to be 10 feet

2306
02:10:27,130 --> 02:10:32,930
tall and then hundreds of other seeds appear inside of this thing's

2307
02:10:32,930 --> 02:10:36,729
head, which then you can individually put in the ground that turn

2308
02:10:36,729 --> 02:10:41,130
into this thing, which also produce hundreds of things to put in the

2309
02:10:41,130 --> 02:10:41,430
ground.

2310
02:10:41,529 --> 02:10:43,930
Isn't that the kind of the same thing with like people though?

2311
02:10:44,329 --> 02:10:48,739
You just put one seed in and you could end up with hundreds of people.

2312
02:10:48,739 --> 02:10:49,739
Yeah, but oh, no, no, no.

2313
02:10:50,640 --> 02:10:55,439
I mean in a kind of in a way but no because we're talking about like

2314
02:10:56,039 --> 02:10:58,239
thousands and thousands of seeds.

2315
02:11:02,220 --> 02:11:04,720
One person doesn't have thousands and thousands of babies.

2316
02:11:09,079 --> 02:11:18,840
I mean back in the old days speak for yourself.

2317
02:11:25,500 --> 02:11:26,800
What does he mean?

2318
02:11:27,399 --> 02:11:29,600
One person doesn't get thousands of seeds.

2319
02:11:32,210 --> 02:11:33,210
What is he saying?

2320
02:11:34,609 --> 02:11:36,109
I mean, there's no real point of what I'm saying.

2321
02:11:36,109 --> 02:11:40,710
I'm saying it's kind of remarkable that that look like a corn corn.

2322
02:11:41,779 --> 02:11:42,979
That's wild.

2323
02:11:45,920 --> 02:11:46,619
It's wild.

2324
02:11:46,720 --> 02:11:47,619
I agree.

2325
02:11:47,619 --> 02:11:48,319
I agree.

2326
02:11:48,319 --> 02:11:49,119
You I'm dead.

2327
02:11:49,220 --> 02:11:52,520
I you know what you know what about nature gets me if we're going to

2328
02:11:52,520 --> 02:11:57,319
take a step back from corn for one second how you get all of these

2329
02:11:57,319 --> 02:12:00,220
like in like a rain forest in this really tiny ecosystem.

2330
02:12:00,220 --> 02:12:04,220
You'll get like one bug for a plant.

2331
02:12:04,220 --> 02:12:07,420
Well, let's we'll stay on plants a plant that evolves its flowers to

2332
02:12:07,420 --> 02:12:11,619
look like a very specific kind of butterfly you attract that like

2333
02:12:11,619 --> 02:12:15,220
how does the plant wake up in the morning go that fucking I know that

2334
02:12:15,220 --> 02:12:16,220
that like Monarch.

2335
02:12:17,020 --> 02:12:18,319
I'm going to be that Monarch.

2336
02:12:18,720 --> 02:12:24,170
Yes or or let's talk nature.

2337
02:12:24,170 --> 02:12:24,970
You want to hear nature.

2338
02:12:25,170 --> 02:12:28,069
What's that bird that can literally imitate the sound of a chainsaw

2339
02:12:28,069 --> 02:12:28,970
like it's a recording?

2340
02:12:35,220 --> 02:12:39,119
I heard I know I know you're talking about they can play back sound

2341
02:12:39,119 --> 02:12:42,720
effects exactly the way that they sounded it is a recording.

2342
02:12:43,619 --> 02:12:46,119
What was that guy's name from police Academy?

2343
02:12:46,119 --> 02:12:49,520
He got so much credit and fucking birds were doing it already.

2344
02:12:57,380 --> 02:13:02,979
All we need now stir is we need that YouTube shorts fucking music

2345
02:13:02,979 --> 02:13:04,979
thing to play in the background while we talk about this the one

2346
02:13:04,979 --> 02:13:15,479
that goes I know that there's one that plays I didn't know that

2347
02:13:15,479 --> 02:13:20,939
it went like a like a Christmas Halloween, which okay.

2348
02:13:20,939 --> 02:13:22,039
I'm we're having some trouble.

2349
02:13:22,140 --> 02:13:22,939
We're having some trouble.

2350
02:13:23,140 --> 02:13:26,439
But at the at the rift, what do you do?

2351
02:13:27,539 --> 02:13:28,640
There's some guys here.

2352
02:13:30,510 --> 02:13:31,010
You dead.

2353
02:13:40,409 --> 02:13:41,310
It's Michael Winslow.

2354
02:13:42,279 --> 02:13:44,979
Yeah, the sound effects guy Michael Winslow is so talented.

2355
02:13:44,979 --> 02:13:48,079
It's unbelievable Michael Winslow Michael Winslow can do the X

2356
02:13:48,079 --> 02:13:48,680
files.

2357
02:13:48,680 --> 02:13:51,680
I was thinking the other one whenever someone's like like speaking

2358
02:13:51,680 --> 02:13:52,380
like the truth.

2359
02:13:52,380 --> 02:13:58,979
It's got this like low rumbly edgy sort of how to put it.

2360
02:14:00,880 --> 02:14:02,479
Are you planning on doing anything with fire?

2361
02:14:02,680 --> 02:14:05,680
And I know I made this stupid joke that I want to be the ice

2362
02:14:05,680 --> 02:14:05,979
guy.

2363
02:14:05,979 --> 02:14:10,779
But one of the unique upgrades on this is enemies that are in

2364
02:14:10,779 --> 02:14:13,579
the tar trap take more fire damage.

2365
02:14:15,569 --> 02:14:16,270
Go for it.

2366
02:14:18,239 --> 02:14:19,239
But I'm the ice guy.

2367
02:14:20,100 --> 02:14:22,600
Looks like are you guys going to be the fire guy?

2368
02:14:25,090 --> 02:14:26,789
There's not even a fire weapon yet.

2369
02:14:31,529 --> 02:14:32,829
I don't even know why I picked that.

2370
02:14:38,859 --> 02:14:39,260
I don't know.

2371
02:14:39,260 --> 02:14:39,960
I don't really know.

2372
02:14:39,960 --> 02:14:41,560
I want anything to cane.

2373
02:14:41,560 --> 02:14:42,760
What about Dwarven Warhammer?

2374
02:14:47,039 --> 02:14:55,380
Stone staff physical attack wind belt flame bracers.

2375
02:14:55,579 --> 02:14:55,880
Okay.

2376
02:14:55,880 --> 02:14:56,779
I'm almost ready for it.

2377
02:15:02,079 --> 02:15:09,880
Anything else I can do we use in the barricades a lot.

2378
02:15:09,880 --> 02:15:12,819
I want to reduce their cost here.

2379
02:15:12,819 --> 02:15:14,720
I'm I'm refunding all my upgrades.

2380
02:15:15,420 --> 02:15:16,020
Don't start.

2381
02:15:16,420 --> 02:15:20,020
I have nothing already did don't start don't I you have pressed

2382
02:15:20,020 --> 02:15:20,619
it already.

2383
02:15:22,510 --> 02:15:25,750
So quick was just as powerful as master sickness.

2384
02:15:25,750 --> 02:15:26,550
We have a new thing.

2385
02:15:26,550 --> 02:15:29,949
Yes, I don't that's just sickness.

2386
02:15:29,949 --> 02:15:30,850
Look at how cool this looks.

2387
02:15:33,449 --> 02:15:33,949
We go back.

2388
02:15:35,550 --> 02:15:39,250
Can we refund it every upgrade right before we started?

2389
02:15:39,250 --> 02:15:40,250
I guess we could just go back.

2390
02:15:41,550 --> 02:15:44,149
Or do you want to do you think you can handle them apart?

2391
02:15:44,250 --> 02:15:45,449
I think I can handle it.

2392
02:15:45,550 --> 02:15:46,949
You're supposed to be a gamer actually.

2393
02:15:46,949 --> 02:15:47,550
No, no, no, no, no.

2394
02:15:47,550 --> 02:15:49,250
I don't want to be responsible for fucking up this whole thing.

2395
02:15:49,250 --> 02:15:52,149
So seriously, I mean, do you not trust me?

2396
02:15:52,750 --> 02:15:55,050
No, I just don't I'm the only one that can place stuff on the

2397
02:15:55,050 --> 02:15:56,850
ground and I will I can play stuff.

2398
02:15:56,949 --> 02:16:00,090
Oh you can yeah, I'm just like don't have none of my stuff

2399
02:16:00,090 --> 02:16:00,890
is upgraded.

2400
02:16:01,289 --> 02:16:03,489
What's this new archer thing we got?

2401
02:16:04,489 --> 02:16:11,550
Oh, we got a lady was it we just make ladies already an archer

Okay.

2404
02:16:15,550 --> 02:16:15,949
Thank you.

2405
02:16:21,630 --> 02:16:23,829
What do you do to say to someone who doesn't like cheese to

2406
02:16:23,829 --> 02:16:25,029
convince them that they are wrong?

2407
02:16:26,609 --> 02:16:28,909
You take a step back and understand that people have preferences

2408
02:16:28,909 --> 02:16:31,310
that are not yours and you relax.

2409
02:16:37,200 --> 02:16:37,399
Okay.

2410
02:16:37,399 --> 02:16:40,100
What do you say to someone who thinks corn is like normal you

2411
02:16:40,299 --> 02:16:41,700
get fucking furious?

2412
02:16:42,100 --> 02:16:43,500
Wait, no, no, no, you see you said normal.

2413
02:16:43,700 --> 02:16:44,299
No, that's fine.

2414
02:16:46,139 --> 02:16:47,739
Well, we're just talking about how weird corn is.

2415
02:16:50,229 --> 02:16:54,639
I should I'm just going to block one of these and they cross

2416
02:16:54,639 --> 02:16:55,739
the lake.

2417
02:16:57,180 --> 02:16:57,879
Probably not, right?

2418
02:17:08,760 --> 02:17:09,459
Okay, I guess we're ready.

2419
02:17:11,190 --> 02:17:11,590
Good.

2420
02:17:12,719 --> 02:17:13,319
Watch out here.

2421
02:17:13,319 --> 02:17:14,520
They come the funny way you do.

2422
02:17:14,520 --> 02:17:15,620
Yeah stones.

2423
02:17:16,600 --> 02:17:19,840
Oh stones there stir.

2424
02:17:19,840 --> 02:17:21,040
That'll be a thousand dollars.

2425
02:17:21,040 --> 02:17:23,639
Enemies are preparing to I didn't what I didn't ask.

2426
02:17:23,739 --> 02:17:25,040
I just but I want you to pay.

2427
02:17:30,379 --> 02:17:31,379
Here they come.

2428
02:17:33,040 --> 02:17:34,670
No, okay.

2429
02:17:34,670 --> 02:17:37,170
You know what last time last like four times you did this

2430
02:17:37,170 --> 02:17:37,370
joke.

2431
02:17:37,370 --> 02:17:37,870
I paid you.

2432
02:17:37,870 --> 02:17:38,770
I'm not doing it this time.

2433
02:17:40,610 --> 02:17:41,309
You're gonna kill the troll.

2434
02:17:41,709 --> 02:17:43,110
Trolls Trolls.

2435
02:17:43,809 --> 02:18:05,059
Yeah, but I mean I appreciate that ice is actually very

2436
02:18:05,059 --> 02:18:05,760
good for those guys.

2437
02:18:09,510 --> 02:18:12,110
Yeah, me and the elves got this covered.

2438
02:18:25,340 --> 02:18:28,239
So did you play any of you play in any World of Warcraft

2439
02:18:28,239 --> 02:18:28,739
lately?

2440
02:18:30,510 --> 02:18:33,420
No, why is that?

2441
02:18:34,559 --> 02:18:38,159
Because I don't have time to dedicate to World of Warcraft

2442
02:18:38,559 --> 02:18:38,959
right now.

2443
02:18:40,190 --> 02:18:41,989
But don't you just like get your gear score up to like a

2444
02:18:41,989 --> 02:18:43,989
certain amount then there's no content to do anyway.

2445
02:18:45,290 --> 02:18:47,389
So like like how much time do you really need to dedicate

2446
02:18:47,389 --> 02:18:47,790
to that?

2447
02:18:51,440 --> 02:18:52,639
I don't really want to play an animal.

2448
02:19:02,319 --> 02:19:07,180
Okay, just wondering but why though?

2449
02:19:07,680 --> 02:19:08,879
I don't know wondering.

2450
02:19:09,180 --> 02:19:11,780
I know they had like dragon play and like usually do you

2451
02:19:11,780 --> 02:19:14,180
really talk about like wow, I haven't played any of you

2452
02:19:14,180 --> 02:19:15,479
put all those archers up there.

2453
02:19:15,479 --> 02:19:16,680
That's actually a really good idea.

2454
02:19:17,180 --> 02:19:17,579
I did.

2455
02:19:17,780 --> 02:19:19,180
I got the goons really smart.

2456
02:19:21,280 --> 02:19:23,479
Also, they're all loyal to me.

2457
02:19:45,579 --> 02:19:47,379
Okay, here.

2458
02:19:47,479 --> 02:19:51,780
So now we got to figure out this part here.

2459
02:19:52,579 --> 02:19:56,379
Now we got to watch.

2460
02:19:56,479 --> 02:19:57,579
Will they walk?

2461
02:19:57,979 --> 02:20:01,180
There's more coming.

2462
02:20:02,209 --> 02:20:04,709
I think we need to block one of these.

2463
02:20:05,010 --> 02:20:06,409
Should I come over here?

2464
02:20:08,549 --> 02:20:10,850
Start pressing buttons on your go XLR.

2465
02:20:11,149 --> 02:20:13,750
That stopped being funny for five years ago.

2466
02:20:13,750 --> 02:20:14,450
Don't come to this side.

2467
02:20:14,450 --> 02:20:14,950
Come to this way.

2468
02:20:14,950 --> 02:20:17,950
You want to block all of them on one side then so they

2469
02:20:17,950 --> 02:20:20,989
only come to one side like if we can like barricade this

2470
02:20:20,989 --> 02:20:21,690
whole spot.

2471
02:20:22,090 --> 02:20:24,889
If you got got money got money right there money got money.

2472
02:20:25,190 --> 02:20:26,889
I do do it.

2473
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:28,600
That's tar.

2474
02:20:28,600 --> 02:20:30,500
I messed it up.

2475
02:20:30,500 --> 02:20:30,799
I messed it up.

2476
02:20:30,799 --> 02:20:31,299
I didn't mean to.

2477
02:20:31,399 --> 02:20:32,299
Did you see tar?

2478
02:20:33,270 --> 02:20:34,370
I have it on my bar.

2479
02:20:37,170 --> 02:20:39,569
Okay, that's too disturbed minus two to clown boy.

2480
02:20:44,340 --> 02:20:45,239
I don't think that's fair.

2481
02:20:47,639 --> 02:20:50,239
So what about this other side then where they're going this

2482
02:20:50,239 --> 02:20:50,739
way.

2483
02:20:52,409 --> 02:20:54,510
So is the idea that they're going to only come up this

2484
02:20:54,510 --> 02:20:55,309
staircase there?

2485
02:20:55,309 --> 02:20:58,409
Yeah, that seems to be how it's going and then they're all

2486
02:20:58,409 --> 02:21:01,209
going to walk past my my archers.

2487
02:21:02,209 --> 02:21:03,809
Well, I guess let's do it.

2488
02:21:05,770 --> 02:21:11,549
I mean what else is there to do but do it so be prepared.

2489
02:21:12,809 --> 02:21:14,510
Another doors being attacked.

2490
02:21:15,209 --> 02:21:16,909
I should focus on this door first dessert.

2491
02:21:16,909 --> 02:21:18,010
They got the shortest path.

2492
02:21:19,819 --> 02:21:20,520
I'm gonna stay up here.

2493
02:21:23,500 --> 02:21:30,790
Would you say you're a nerd a dork or a geek nerd?

2494
02:21:31,790 --> 02:21:32,489
I think I'm a dork.

2495
02:21:33,969 --> 02:21:34,569
I agree.

2496
02:21:35,889 --> 02:21:36,590
I agree with that.

2497
02:21:41,489 --> 02:21:42,389
I thought that was you.

2498
02:21:42,389 --> 02:21:44,489
I thought like you exploded into blood.

2499
02:21:45,799 --> 02:21:46,100
Yes.

2500
02:21:46,100 --> 02:21:48,200
So they're figuring out they can't go that way and they're

2501
02:21:48,200 --> 02:21:48,700
turning around.

2502
02:21:48,700 --> 02:22:13,459
Yeah, this is a corners looking a little little rough.

2503
02:22:17,690 --> 02:22:17,989
All right.

2504
02:22:17,989 --> 02:22:19,590
I don't know my in my brain.

2505
02:22:21,209 --> 02:22:25,409
You said corner is looking a little rough and in my head

2506
02:22:25,409 --> 02:22:28,909
it was we were talking about corn and like everybody calls

2507
02:22:28,909 --> 02:22:31,909
themselves like the thing that we're currently oh like drew

2508
02:22:31,909 --> 02:22:34,809
crew like Drewers and stuff.

2509
02:22:34,909 --> 02:22:36,809
I thought you were talking about people that enjoy corn

2510
02:22:36,809 --> 02:22:39,010
in the chapter because of like you were talking we were

2511
02:22:39,010 --> 02:22:40,309
talking shit about corn earlier.

2512
02:22:41,309 --> 02:22:43,610
Like all the corners are looking like they're really rough

2513
02:22:43,610 --> 02:22:44,110
right now.

2514
02:22:46,200 --> 02:22:46,700
I was like, what is he?

2515
02:22:46,700 --> 02:22:47,600
Why are you saying that?

2516
02:22:49,979 --> 02:22:54,120
Well, I wasn't saying that is the secret.

2517
02:22:54,219 --> 02:22:54,520
Yeah.

2518
02:22:55,559 --> 02:23:00,110
I know that now corn crew.

2519
02:23:00,110 --> 02:23:03,620
Yeah, corn through corners.

2520
02:23:04,879 --> 02:23:15,229
Corners the corn the corn guys or whatever these archers.

2521
02:23:15,430 --> 02:23:18,729
I'm with all my upgrade points that I don't have and was

2522
02:23:18,729 --> 02:23:19,430
unable to use.

2523
02:23:19,430 --> 02:23:20,829
I think I'm gonna upgrade these archers.

2524
02:23:21,229 --> 02:23:22,530
They seem really actually really good.

2525
02:23:31,629 --> 02:23:32,629
They can't even get through.

2526
02:23:33,329 --> 02:23:34,829
You've got this completely on lockdown.

2527
02:23:50,680 --> 02:23:53,379
Shout out to you don't actually I had corn yesterday.

2528
02:23:53,680 --> 02:23:54,280
How is that?

2529
02:23:54,280 --> 02:23:55,780
How funny is that?

2530
02:23:57,139 --> 02:24:00,840
It is not necessarily that surprising corn is like a base

2531
02:24:00,840 --> 02:24:02,239
of tons of different meals.

2532
02:24:03,729 --> 02:24:06,969
Yeah, but like raw corn.

2533
02:24:08,840 --> 02:24:10,040
How funny is that?

2534
02:24:10,739 --> 02:24:11,940
Wait, that's funny.

2535
02:24:15,059 --> 02:24:16,260
That's funny.

2536
02:24:26,670 --> 02:24:27,469
Yeah, I thought so.

2537
02:24:28,370 --> 02:24:29,969
Do you want me to block this?

2538
02:24:29,969 --> 02:24:33,270
So they have to go like the optimal here.

2539
02:24:33,469 --> 02:24:34,870
I don't think you're needed.

2540
02:24:35,469 --> 02:24:36,969
I don't think so either.

2541
02:24:38,299 --> 02:24:41,909
I think we're gonna lose our jobs to these archers.

2542
02:25:04,250 --> 02:25:05,350
Oh, they are coming this way.

2543
02:25:07,159 --> 02:25:07,760
You don't fuck.

2544
02:25:07,760 --> 02:25:09,260
Don't don't worry about it.

2545
02:25:09,260 --> 02:25:11,059
My gal will handle it.

2546
02:25:14,440 --> 02:25:16,440
They're already doing this well with three points.

2547
02:25:16,440 --> 02:25:18,639
I feel like they're going to be disgusting.

2548
02:25:21,610 --> 02:25:22,409
We're three points.

2549
02:25:22,610 --> 02:25:24,709
What if you upgrade them?

2550
02:25:25,510 --> 02:25:26,110
Yes.

2551
02:25:27,209 --> 02:25:27,809
Yes.

2552
02:25:28,110 --> 02:25:28,909
Yes.

2553
02:25:29,549 --> 02:25:30,250
You get it.

2554
02:25:30,750 --> 02:25:31,350
Yes.

2555
02:25:32,409 --> 02:25:33,909
This guy fucking gets it.

2556
02:25:37,239 --> 02:25:42,079
Yes corn on the cob or corn from the can corn from the can.

2557
02:25:42,180 --> 02:25:47,280
What what you gave me the option of like natural from the earth

2558
02:25:48,280 --> 02:25:50,079
and canned corn.

2559
02:25:51,620 --> 02:25:54,719
Yeah, but corn from the earth can be kind of messy.

2560
02:25:56,700 --> 02:25:59,100
It's I don't I love corn on the cob.

2561
02:25:59,100 --> 02:26:01,200
It's it's like a it's an S tier.

2562
02:26:01,200 --> 02:26:05,629
That's what it can get kind of messy and you get that thing

2563
02:26:05,629 --> 02:26:08,329
where there's those weird fibers that go into every single

2564
02:26:08,329 --> 02:26:10,129
gap in every single one of your teeth.

2565
02:26:11,030 --> 02:26:15,530
I'm going to say that we're living in like we're lucky to be

2566
02:26:15,530 --> 02:26:18,829
living in the like very brief part of human history right

2567
02:26:18,829 --> 02:26:23,629
before we all start to like live in spaceships and like in

2568
02:26:23,629 --> 02:26:25,430
vats and we're like grown.

2569
02:26:27,129 --> 02:26:29,329
Right and we're going to be like one of the last generations

2570
02:26:29,329 --> 02:26:32,229
that can appreciate like really like grown foods.

2571
02:26:32,629 --> 02:26:34,930
So I'm every time I'm going to choose something that's not

2572
02:26:34,930 --> 02:26:40,399
out of a can that's just one of many privileges of living in

2573
02:26:40,399 --> 02:26:40,899
this era.

2574
02:26:41,600 --> 02:26:45,000
Why are you assuming that the corn that they pull off the

2575
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,399
cobs and put into the cans is somehow not real?

2576
02:26:48,559 --> 02:26:50,760
I mean, it's every every, you know, a couple years.

2577
02:26:50,760 --> 02:26:52,059
It's getting less and less real.

2578
02:26:52,959 --> 02:27:01,100
Is the problem can understand that it's going to be all

2579
02:27:01,100 --> 02:27:01,799
virtual.

2580
02:27:06,159 --> 02:27:14,309
I mean, if if Facebook alien guy live this fucking way in

2581
02:27:14,309 --> 02:27:15,510
the metaverse, we have a meal.

2582
02:27:15,510 --> 02:27:16,209
Hey, sir.

2583
02:27:16,209 --> 02:27:17,510
We have bombs to drop.

2584
02:27:17,510 --> 02:27:18,309
You see these barrels.

2585
02:27:19,110 --> 02:27:20,110
Yeah, we have.

2586
02:27:20,110 --> 02:27:21,110
Have we done it once?

2587
02:27:21,610 --> 02:27:22,709
No, have we needed it?

2588
02:27:23,510 --> 02:27:24,709
No, but it's kind of fun to do.

2589
02:27:25,790 --> 02:27:28,590
I assumed that they were like a limited so I didn't want to

2590
02:27:28,590 --> 02:27:34,690
like waste them, but I'll shoot one.

2591
02:27:35,489 --> 02:27:35,989
I'll do it.

2592
02:27:36,389 --> 02:27:37,090
This is way too lean.

2593
02:27:38,329 --> 02:27:43,459
Corn could be ground hydroponically with patients, right?

2594
02:27:43,459 --> 02:27:45,260
You wrote ground instead of grown.

2595
02:27:45,260 --> 02:27:47,260
Like I'm not going to trust a single thing out of your mouth.

2596
02:27:47,260 --> 02:27:48,360
It's not happening that way.

2597
02:27:51,229 --> 02:27:52,629
Well, this means cornflower.

2598
02:27:55,489 --> 02:27:58,489
You got a corn tortilla before once they start growing

2599
02:27:58,489 --> 02:27:59,290
in on the spaceships.

2600
02:27:59,290 --> 02:28:03,940
It's going to be all like a barricade is under attack like

2601
02:28:03,940 --> 02:28:07,440
grown with like super hormones and shit.

2602
02:28:07,440 --> 02:28:08,139
You know what I mean?

2603
02:28:15,850 --> 02:28:21,149
Like a strawberry today isn't what a strawberry was in the

2604
02:28:21,149 --> 02:28:21,850
old days.

2605
02:28:31,639 --> 02:28:32,440
They're going to get in.

2606
02:28:34,540 --> 02:28:35,540
I don't do anything.

2607
02:28:35,540 --> 02:28:41,670
What we just almost lost in one second.

2608
02:28:41,770 --> 02:28:42,569
What happened?

2609
02:28:43,510 --> 02:28:43,909
I'm dead.

2610
02:28:44,209 --> 02:28:44,610
I don't know.

2611
02:28:44,610 --> 02:28:45,309
They broke it.

2612
02:28:45,909 --> 02:28:46,409
What?

2613
02:28:48,629 --> 02:28:49,030
Okay.

2614
02:28:49,030 --> 02:28:49,329
I don't know.

2615
02:28:49,329 --> 02:28:52,229
I don't know how or why this is fine.

2616
02:28:53,620 --> 02:28:54,620
I rebuilt it.

2617
02:28:54,920 --> 02:28:56,020
I was destroyed.

2618
02:28:56,420 --> 02:28:56,819
Okay.

2619
02:29:00,250 --> 02:29:01,950
Should I put some stuff here to hurt them?

2620
02:29:03,850 --> 02:29:08,780
I'm gonna and let's do this too.

2621
02:29:09,979 --> 02:29:13,079
I mean we should I'm going to get some shit here that they

2622
02:29:13,079 --> 02:29:13,879
can just slow down.

2623
02:29:30,409 --> 02:29:31,010
Do you okay?

2624
02:29:31,010 --> 02:29:33,409
Here's here's a you know, continuing down that line of

2625
02:29:33,409 --> 02:29:35,510
thinking because my brain went a little bit on it a little

2626
02:29:35,510 --> 02:29:36,010
bit too long.

2627
02:29:36,010 --> 02:29:39,719
And this is when we get like the truly transcendent takes

2628
02:29:39,819 --> 02:29:45,600
so they're learning how to make their growing meat in labs.

2629
02:29:45,600 --> 02:29:46,899
What are you?

2630
02:29:46,899 --> 02:29:47,399
What do you say?

2631
02:29:47,399 --> 02:29:48,200
Are you kidding me?

2632
02:29:48,299 --> 02:29:48,700
What?

2633
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:49,799
No, they aren't.

2634
02:29:50,799 --> 02:29:51,899
Where did you hear this from?

2635
02:29:52,200 --> 02:29:53,500
Are you fucking kidding me?

2636
02:29:53,700 --> 02:29:55,600
I just saw it on the internet.

2637
02:29:56,600 --> 02:29:57,500
I read it on the internet.

2638
02:30:02,809 --> 02:30:03,809
You had your fun.

2639
02:30:04,809 --> 02:30:06,010
Do you want to have a conversation with me?

2640
02:30:06,010 --> 02:30:06,809
Do you want me to shut up?

2641
02:30:06,909 --> 02:30:08,809
Oh, I was going to say that's it.

2642
02:30:08,809 --> 02:30:09,510
Whatever you said.

2643
02:30:09,510 --> 02:30:10,510
They're getting in the back.

2644
02:30:15,729 --> 02:30:16,530
It's over dude.

2645
02:30:16,930 --> 02:30:17,430
It's over.

2646
02:30:20,219 --> 02:30:20,719
Do this.

2647
02:30:22,719 --> 02:30:24,120
My god, it's over.

2648
02:30:25,719 --> 02:30:26,420
Dude, it's over.

2649
02:30:26,420 --> 02:30:27,420
We don't stand a chance.

2650
02:30:29,479 --> 02:30:29,979
We're fine.

2651
02:30:30,579 --> 02:30:31,079
We're fine.

2652
02:30:37,979 --> 02:30:38,579
Holy shit.

2653
02:30:38,579 --> 02:30:39,079
We're in trouble.

2654
02:30:39,079 --> 02:30:39,579
Five.

2655
02:30:39,680 --> 02:30:40,180
Yeah, five.

2656
02:30:55,379 --> 02:30:56,780
The lady archers are up here too.

2657
02:30:56,780 --> 02:30:57,479
They're helping.

2658
02:30:57,979 --> 02:30:58,579
Thank goodness.

2659
02:31:08,100 --> 02:31:09,600
Well, that was almost a disaster.

2660
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:10,799
That was scary.

2661
02:31:13,430 --> 02:31:16,129
We had five stars to you gotta be kidding me.

2662
02:31:17,489 --> 02:31:17,889
Okay.

2663
02:31:20,010 --> 02:31:20,809
I've never I've never run.

2664
02:31:20,809 --> 02:31:22,010
I have to do all of my upgrades.

2665
02:31:22,010 --> 02:31:23,709
I'm not I'm not getting distracted on this right now.

2666
02:31:23,909 --> 02:31:25,510
There are more important things in life.

2667
02:31:26,110 --> 02:31:28,309
Yes, I will bank bank of archers.

2668
02:31:28,309 --> 02:31:29,909
What is a bank of archers?

2669
02:31:31,520 --> 02:31:32,020
I don't know.

2670
02:31:33,110 --> 02:31:34,409
It's like a whole squad of them.

2671
02:31:36,239 --> 02:31:40,139
So it looks like the only upgrade for the Guardian archer is health.

2672
02:31:41,299 --> 02:31:43,600
By you fire damage.

2673
02:31:43,600 --> 02:31:45,500
I have something that increases fire damage.

2674
02:31:46,799 --> 02:31:47,100
Okay.

2675
02:31:47,100 --> 02:31:48,299
I took the fire damage.

2676
02:31:48,299 --> 02:31:54,200
I heard that is the slow the tar traps do more fire damage.

2677
02:32:09,180 --> 02:32:10,379
There's a bunch of other stuff.

2678
02:32:10,379 --> 02:32:15,940
I want to look at confusion flower is 10 seconds.

2679
02:32:15,940 --> 02:32:17,139
Song is actually fire.

2680
02:32:19,750 --> 02:32:20,350
That's kind of cool.

2681
02:32:20,750 --> 02:32:28,469
So they imagine that they they attack each other giant killer

2682
02:32:28,469 --> 02:32:35,959
beehive tree Dwarven hammer is Pog.

2683
02:32:35,959 --> 02:32:36,760
You have to get it.

2684
02:32:38,299 --> 02:32:46,670
What about the floor scorcher the shock zapper?

2685
02:32:53,750 --> 02:32:59,799
These all sound like one punch man characters snow cannon shock

2686
02:32:59,799 --> 02:33:09,840
zapper ripsaw saw blade launcher tornado in a box friend kisser.

2687
02:33:19,520 --> 02:33:20,120
Okay.

2688
02:33:21,120 --> 02:33:25,020
Where's my thing that I mean, just say you can like try it.

2689
02:33:26,090 --> 02:33:27,290
I'm going to get the flame thing.

2690
02:33:34,690 --> 02:33:34,989
Okay.

2691
02:33:34,989 --> 02:33:36,389
I've re-bought all new stuff.

2692
02:33:36,389 --> 02:33:36,790
I'm good.

2693
02:33:37,190 --> 02:33:43,020
What I was going to say is in the future even the growing meat

2694
02:33:43,020 --> 02:33:43,819
in labs.

2695
02:33:44,420 --> 02:33:45,219
Yeah, right.

2696
02:33:46,819 --> 02:33:47,020
Yeah.

2697
02:33:47,020 --> 02:33:51,420
So at what point will it be considered like you're no longer

2698
02:33:51,420 --> 02:33:55,819
a vegetarian if you eat grown vegetables like oh this corn grew

2699
02:33:55,819 --> 02:33:59,620
out of the ground and like that's no we only eat lab-grown stuff

2700
02:33:59,620 --> 02:34:01,620
like if you're eating like earth-grown stuff, you're actually

2701
02:34:01,620 --> 02:34:05,290
a bad person and you aren't a real vegetarian because you're

2702
02:34:05,290 --> 02:34:06,489
not eating lab-grown meat.

2703
02:34:07,579 --> 02:34:09,879
That's the only like truly moral way to go because plants have

2704
02:34:09,879 --> 02:34:10,579
feelings too.

2705
02:34:12,479 --> 02:34:15,280
I mean, I think that there's a very big question to have about

2706
02:34:15,680 --> 02:34:17,379
how to have a more ethical meat industry.

2707
02:34:17,379 --> 02:34:19,280
I think that that's a good question to ask.

2708
02:34:19,280 --> 02:34:19,979
I'd really do.

2709
02:34:22,579 --> 02:34:26,379
But I mean that's that's a that's like a six-hour conversation.

2710
02:34:27,979 --> 02:34:29,079
And you're not ready for that.

2711
02:34:29,479 --> 02:34:30,579
I don't think you're ready for that one.

2712
02:34:31,379 --> 02:34:32,280
Why am I not ready?

2713
02:34:37,180 --> 02:34:38,579
Nice politician answer.

2714
02:34:39,379 --> 02:34:39,780
What are?

2715
02:34:40,680 --> 02:34:42,280
Well, you know, I think there is a question to be had about

2716
02:34:42,280 --> 02:34:46,079
ethical meat and how we address that and how we going forward

2717
02:34:46,280 --> 02:34:49,680
we come up with these complex solutions that eventually will

2718
02:34:49,680 --> 02:34:53,680
put our humanity obviously forward and first throughout our

2719
02:34:53,780 --> 02:34:55,680
galaxy and throw up to the cosmos.

2720
02:34:55,680 --> 02:34:58,979
But the complex questions and answers that we've been asking

2721
02:34:58,979 --> 02:35:02,979
about this exact topic is absolutely something that we can

2722
02:35:02,979 --> 02:35:06,079
address and we can move forward when that time comes to that

2723
02:35:06,079 --> 02:35:07,979
topic and that topic is incredibly important by the way.

2724
02:35:07,979 --> 02:35:10,180
I want to make sure you understand that the topic at hand

2725
02:35:10,180 --> 02:35:13,680
we're discussing is this concept that I think a lot of people

2726
02:35:13,680 --> 02:35:17,479
really they relate to and I think that it's a very good question

2727
02:35:17,479 --> 02:35:18,879
and I yield the rest of my time.

2728
02:35:26,219 --> 02:35:28,420
I'm glad you didn't you're I'm glad you're taking it seriously.

2729
02:35:28,420 --> 02:35:30,020
Oh Doug Doug right.

2730
02:35:31,590 --> 02:35:32,190
What's going on?

2731
02:35:33,420 --> 02:35:34,020
Thanks the raid.

2732
02:35:34,850 --> 02:35:35,649
Welcome Raiders.

2733
02:35:36,149 --> 02:35:37,450
Welcome Doug Doug viewers.

2734
02:35:38,319 --> 02:35:39,020
Thanks Doug Doug.

2735
02:35:40,079 --> 02:35:41,479
Planes of Orks must die with stir.

2736
02:35:42,270 --> 02:35:42,870
It's real.

2737
02:35:42,870 --> 02:35:45,969
Oh you came in at a really weird spot when I was that's kind

2738
02:35:45,969 --> 02:35:46,370
of funny.

2739
02:35:46,870 --> 02:35:47,569
Yeah, welcome.

2740
02:35:47,569 --> 02:35:47,969
Thanks.

2741
02:35:50,559 --> 02:35:54,860
I saw I saw Doug Doug doing a funny thing trying to get his

2742
02:35:54,860 --> 02:35:58,559
chat to to beat Mario maker levels.

2743
02:35:58,559 --> 02:35:59,860
He had one one life to do it.

2744
02:36:01,510 --> 02:36:02,110
That was pretty fun.

2745
02:36:02,909 --> 02:36:03,510
I'm dead.

2746
02:36:06,659 --> 02:36:07,159
Yeah, welcome.

2747
02:36:12,540 --> 02:36:14,239
You've got to be trolling me.

2748
02:36:18,120 --> 02:36:19,620
I do have a question for Doug Doug viewers.

2749
02:36:19,620 --> 02:36:20,920
Did you actually do it?

2750
02:36:21,420 --> 02:36:22,520
Did you actually do it?

2751
02:36:23,319 --> 02:36:25,520
Would you beat those levels in a row?

2752
02:36:27,389 --> 02:36:28,290
You actually did it.

2753
02:36:28,489 --> 02:36:28,889
Okay.

2754
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:33,700
No, I'm seeing a lot of nose.

2755
02:36:41,030 --> 02:36:41,829
How are we handling this?

2756
02:36:42,629 --> 02:36:43,930
This is like a scary one.

2757
02:36:43,930 --> 02:36:46,629
I put a barricade on the left side so they're all going to

2758
02:36:46,629 --> 02:36:49,930
go on the right and then we have our super abilities this

2759
02:36:49,930 --> 02:36:50,329
time.

2760
02:36:50,329 --> 02:36:53,229
So I don't know anything you want to do man.

2761
02:36:54,239 --> 02:36:56,239
We have new super abilities though is important.

2762
02:36:56,719 --> 02:36:58,719
Yeah, I put a whole bunch of ladies up here.

2763
02:37:02,020 --> 02:37:03,020
What should we block?

2764
02:37:03,819 --> 02:37:05,319
I blocked the left side.

2765
02:37:06,440 --> 02:37:08,040
But I mean what sorry rephrase that.

2766
02:37:08,040 --> 02:37:13,059
What should I block as I have ability?

2767
02:37:18,360 --> 02:37:18,760
Okay here.

2768
02:37:18,760 --> 02:37:20,959
Let me let me like grab you by the hand.

2769
02:37:25,180 --> 02:37:27,780
Well, I'm just trying to see what I don't I don't know.

2770
02:37:28,079 --> 02:37:30,379
I really I don't know what you should make at the end of

2771
02:37:30,379 --> 02:37:30,680
here.

2772
02:37:31,180 --> 02:37:33,180
You should play as one of those giant mortars.

2773
02:37:34,809 --> 02:37:37,110
Okay, and then we could like snake them down this whole

2774
02:37:37,110 --> 02:37:37,409
way.

2775
02:37:38,049 --> 02:37:39,149
So I'm going to put it right here.

2776
02:37:41,049 --> 02:37:41,750
I could put another one.

2777
02:37:41,750 --> 02:37:42,750
Do you want to put one up with you?

2778
02:37:43,250 --> 02:37:44,950
No, I think you should make some snakes.

2779
02:37:45,250 --> 02:37:48,250
Okay on this bridge you're talking at the beginning go

2780
02:37:48,250 --> 02:37:48,549
like

2781
02:37:50,149 --> 02:37:51,549
yeah, do do like a little bit.

2782
02:37:52,549 --> 02:37:56,680
Okay, I can make like I think that sounds good.

2783
02:37:58,309 --> 02:37:59,809
Is this enough space for them to move through?

2784
02:38:00,610 --> 02:38:01,209
Yes, it is.

2785
02:38:04,670 --> 02:38:09,020
How thin does it have to be for the like can I put it

2786
02:38:09,020 --> 02:38:09,420
here?

2787
02:38:10,159 --> 02:38:10,959
Will this work?

2788
02:38:12,159 --> 02:38:12,959
Or is that not enough?

2789
02:38:14,360 --> 02:38:16,659
No, see like ogres are going to smash the ogre.

2790
02:38:16,659 --> 02:38:18,159
They need two by twos.

2791
02:38:18,260 --> 02:38:28,750
Okay, one of these that is all I can do.

2792
02:38:30,250 --> 02:38:32,049
I'm going to get into the launcher.

2793
02:38:36,049 --> 02:38:37,850
Do you follow a build guide when you cook?

2794
02:38:40,909 --> 02:38:41,809
A recipe.

2795
02:38:42,579 --> 02:38:42,979
Yeah.

2796
02:38:46,799 --> 02:38:50,069
I guess it depends on what if it's something complicated.

2797
02:38:50,069 --> 02:38:52,170
I mean, yeah, I already know what I'm doing.

2798
02:38:52,170 --> 02:38:54,469
Can you have fun cooking something you've never cooked

2799
02:38:54,469 --> 02:38:55,569
before without a build guide?

2800
02:38:56,799 --> 02:38:57,299
I think it can be.

2801
02:38:57,299 --> 02:38:57,600
Yeah.

2802
02:38:57,600 --> 02:39:00,600
I think if you just kind of experiment like hey, why do

2803
02:39:00,600 --> 02:39:02,100
you need your handheld for PoE?

2804
02:39:04,819 --> 02:39:08,819
Because there's not 12,000 ingredients in a fucking steak

2805
02:39:08,819 --> 02:39:09,620
and cheese sandwich.

2806
02:39:09,620 --> 02:39:11,920
There's there's literally any ingredient in the whole world.

2807
02:39:11,920 --> 02:39:13,920
You could put in it at any time you could choose you could

2808
02:39:13,920 --> 02:39:16,920
randomly even choose to put like Tabasco sauce and blue

2809
02:39:16,920 --> 02:39:18,520
cheese and dip your pizza in it.

2810
02:39:22,620 --> 02:39:25,219
Yeah, but the difference is you are shit.

2811
02:39:25,620 --> 02:39:25,920
That's it.

2812
02:39:25,920 --> 02:39:26,719
You got me.

2813
02:39:26,920 --> 02:39:27,520
Fuck you.

2814
02:39:27,819 --> 02:39:28,219
Hold on.

2815
02:39:29,020 --> 02:39:29,520
Give me a minute.

2816
02:39:29,520 --> 02:39:30,319
I'll come up with something.

2817
02:39:33,909 --> 02:39:36,510
Yeah, there's like every ingredient is available.

2818
02:39:36,809 --> 02:39:37,909
Look, laugh at that guy.

2819
02:39:39,010 --> 02:39:40,809
Every ingredient is available.

2820
02:39:41,309 --> 02:39:43,909
So therefore like I am polish it because why?

2821
02:39:46,200 --> 02:39:46,399
Yeah.

2822
02:39:47,399 --> 02:39:48,000
Okay, hold on.

2823
02:39:48,700 --> 02:39:50,799
If I go to the grocery store and I know what I want to

2824
02:39:50,799 --> 02:39:55,100
make, for instance, I want to make a like a fire mage, right?

2825
02:39:56,600 --> 02:39:58,200
Do you want to go to the grocery store and you want to

2826
02:39:58,200 --> 02:39:59,200
cook a fire mage?

2827
02:40:00,950 --> 02:40:01,850
No, you don't get it.

2828
02:40:02,149 --> 02:40:02,649
You don't get it.

2829
02:40:02,649 --> 02:40:11,120
I'm trying to make like if I want to go to the grocery store

2830
02:40:11,120 --> 02:40:16,549
and make like a salmon like a pan seared salmon, I know

2831
02:40:16,549 --> 02:40:18,649
exactly what I need to buy to do that.

2832
02:40:18,649 --> 02:40:19,850
I'm going to buy salmon.

2833
02:40:20,350 --> 02:40:22,250
I'm going to get on, you know, like oil for the pan.

2834
02:40:22,649 --> 02:40:24,149
I'm going to get like some dill.

2835
02:40:24,350 --> 02:40:25,450
I know what that is.

2836
02:40:25,450 --> 02:40:27,350
It's only like four things to make that.

2837
02:40:27,850 --> 02:40:31,049
If I want to make a pan seared salmon and path of exile,

2838
02:40:31,549 --> 02:40:35,049
I need to look at every fucking food that's ever existed.

2839
02:40:35,049 --> 02:40:44,979
What we lost if you just hold the L hold the L on them getting

2840
02:40:44,979 --> 02:40:45,379
the end.

2841
02:40:45,379 --> 02:40:46,879
Yeah, but here's what I'm saying.

2842
02:40:46,879 --> 02:40:49,280
Like if you want to make a pizza, then you start with pizza

2843
02:40:49,280 --> 02:40:49,479
dough.

2844
02:40:49,479 --> 02:40:51,079
But if you know you want to make an archer, then you start

2845
02:40:51,079 --> 02:40:51,680
with a bow.

2846
02:40:51,879 --> 02:40:52,579
It's the same thing.

2847
02:40:52,579 --> 02:40:54,680
Yeah, but it's but it's not but here's the thing if you

2848
02:40:54,680 --> 02:40:57,180
come to me and say, hey dude, think about pizza tonight.

2849
02:40:57,579 --> 02:40:58,879
Oh, yeah, that sounds good.

2850
02:40:59,280 --> 02:41:01,479
What kind of pizza are we going to have tonight and then

2851
02:41:01,479 --> 02:41:04,479
you back a truck up in my driveway and every single pizza

2852
02:41:04,479 --> 02:41:07,979
ingredient every topping ever is put out into a fucking

2853
02:41:07,979 --> 02:41:11,079
driveway and it's like, oh, yeah, there's like 700 different

2854
02:41:11,079 --> 02:41:12,479
things that could go on pizza.

2855
02:41:12,780 --> 02:41:13,379
What do you want?

2856
02:41:14,379 --> 02:41:16,079
I don't know.

2857
02:41:16,180 --> 02:41:18,180
How do I just have like a pepperoni pizza and then you

2858
02:41:18,180 --> 02:41:20,780
have to go on a second and you like dig through all the

2859
02:41:20,780 --> 02:41:21,180
ingredients.

2860
02:41:21,180 --> 02:41:22,680
We're like, oh, no, that's grapefruit.

2861
02:41:22,879 --> 02:41:23,479
What is this one?

2862
02:41:24,079 --> 02:41:24,879
That's pineapple.

2863
02:41:24,879 --> 02:41:25,180
Hold on.

2864
02:41:25,180 --> 02:41:25,579
I can find it.

2865
02:41:25,579 --> 02:41:26,879
Oh, let me let me let me let me find that.

2866
02:41:26,879 --> 02:41:27,579
Let me find pepperoni.

2867
02:41:28,180 --> 02:41:28,979
It'll take me a minute.

2868
02:41:29,879 --> 02:41:30,979
I need the guidance.

2869
02:41:39,700 --> 02:41:44,540
You're not winning this as long as as long as my

2870
02:41:44,540 --> 02:41:45,940
constituents care, right?

2871
02:41:45,940 --> 02:41:46,440
Then I win.

2872
02:41:48,340 --> 02:41:51,440
I don't know if my archers were shooting anything where

2873
02:41:51,440 --> 02:41:52,239
they're not shooting.

2874
02:41:53,459 --> 02:41:54,860
I know they're up like on this hill.

2875
02:41:55,659 --> 02:41:57,260
I don't think anything's walking close enough.

2876
02:41:58,500 --> 02:42:00,399
I wait that means you guys wait you guys you guys are

2877
02:42:00,399 --> 02:42:03,709
against me though shit.

2878
02:42:04,010 --> 02:42:05,510
I'm going to lose the election to stir.

2879
02:42:06,010 --> 02:42:06,909
I think we both won.

2880
02:42:11,600 --> 02:42:12,500
Oh, you got that flower.

2881
02:42:12,700 --> 02:42:13,299
Is it any good?

2882
02:42:14,399 --> 02:42:15,700
That's the first time I've used it.

2883
02:42:20,579 --> 02:42:22,879
Yeah, I saw I saw these guys were like stunned every

2884
02:42:22,879 --> 02:42:23,879
time I looked over here.

2885
02:42:26,129 --> 02:42:27,930
And what is what is this shift for?

2886
02:42:27,930 --> 02:42:29,530
What is this giant tower?

2887
02:42:32,930 --> 02:42:38,530
What oh by the way all the pizzas is another scenario.

2888
02:42:38,530 --> 02:42:43,209
You've cooked every pizza you you you back up with a

2889
02:42:43,209 --> 02:42:46,209
truck and every topping every combination is in that

2890
02:42:46,209 --> 02:42:47,709
truck and you they're all open.

2891
02:42:47,709 --> 02:42:49,510
Everyone's like opening up like oh look hot and fresh

2892
02:42:49,510 --> 02:42:49,809
and ready.

2893
02:42:49,809 --> 02:42:50,409
Which one do you want?

2894
02:42:51,110 --> 02:42:54,350
And I'm just like I don't that one has olives on it.

2895
02:42:54,350 --> 02:42:54,649
I don't know.

2896
02:42:54,649 --> 02:42:55,549
Do I want all of today?

2897
02:42:55,549 --> 02:42:59,959
I don't think I do where's the who's who has just the

2898
02:42:59,959 --> 02:43:02,459
pepperoni who has pepperoni and there's somebody in

2899
02:43:02,459 --> 02:43:04,059
the back just like screaming I got it.

2900
02:43:04,059 --> 02:43:05,860
I got it, but I have to like this guy's got fucking

2901
02:43:05,860 --> 02:43:06,559
pineapple on it.

2902
02:43:06,559 --> 02:43:07,860
I don't know what I don't know which one I want.

2903
02:43:10,940 --> 02:43:12,940
You're trying to min-max your pizza is your problem.

2904
02:43:14,940 --> 02:43:16,739
You're worried about picking the wrong ingredient for

2905
02:43:16,739 --> 02:43:18,940
your pizza election lost.

2906
02:43:27,809 --> 02:43:29,709
Is it just like Helm's Deep?

2907
02:43:30,680 --> 02:43:35,540
It is and hey, let me tell you something.

2908
02:43:36,610 --> 02:43:39,510
I am fully prepared to enjoy any pizza.

2909
02:43:40,110 --> 02:43:41,709
I just need to know I need to I need a little bit of

2910
02:43:41,709 --> 02:43:42,709
help with what it is.

2911
02:43:44,559 --> 02:43:44,959
Okay.

2912
02:43:46,540 --> 02:43:49,040
I'm so ready to open Path of Exile and become obsessed

2913
02:43:49,040 --> 02:43:49,340
with it.

2914
02:43:49,340 --> 02:43:50,540
I will be obsessed with it.

2915
02:43:51,920 --> 02:43:53,219
I just need to know where to start.

2916
02:43:54,809 --> 02:43:56,110
Are you speaking like you're the president?

2917
02:43:57,879 --> 02:43:59,479
I'm the president of this channel.

2918
02:44:02,379 --> 02:44:02,780
Aren't I?

2919
02:44:06,100 --> 02:44:09,420
I could see that I could definitely see that I can see

2920
02:44:09,420 --> 02:44:10,319
how you are.

2921
02:44:11,739 --> 02:44:12,739
Who's the people saying?

2922
02:44:12,739 --> 02:44:14,540
No, who's the president of this channel then?

2923
02:44:17,469 --> 02:44:19,770
Hey, we got a lot of guys coming through here.

2924
02:44:27,319 --> 02:44:28,520
We are Josh.

2925
02:44:31,670 --> 02:44:32,569
I can't be the VP.

2926
02:44:34,379 --> 02:44:36,479
Would you would you run for office with me as your VP?

2927
02:44:36,479 --> 02:44:38,979
Am I just like the publicist of my own channel?

2928
02:44:38,979 --> 02:44:39,780
Are we talking about?

2929
02:44:41,329 --> 02:44:44,229
Am I like the am I like a PR agent for my me?

2930
02:44:44,829 --> 02:44:45,530
Oh, it's me.

2931
02:44:46,760 --> 02:44:47,760
I own this shit.

2932
02:44:47,860 --> 02:44:49,059
Hold on one day.

2933
02:44:53,139 --> 02:44:54,639
I'm doing like too much goofy stuff.

2934
02:44:54,639 --> 02:44:55,639
I feel like we're gonna lose.

2935
02:44:55,940 --> 02:44:58,440
We might all my money on like towers.

2936
02:44:58,840 --> 02:44:59,739
I think we'll be all right.

2937
02:44:59,840 --> 02:45:01,139
I don't think we're doing anything.

2938
02:45:01,440 --> 02:45:02,440
If we did, it would be fine.

2939
02:45:05,030 --> 02:45:06,829
I don't know if you sell things for full value.

2940
02:45:10,129 --> 02:45:11,530
You're the mascot.

2941
02:45:19,500 --> 02:45:20,500
Yeah, that's fine.

2942
02:45:20,500 --> 02:45:21,399
I am the mascot.

2943
02:45:21,700 --> 02:45:24,600
I get out there in the in the fursuit and I like to like

2944
02:45:24,600 --> 02:45:29,600

02:45:34,200 --> 02:45:38,420
like, let's talk about the issues now and then everyone

2948
02:45:38,420 --> 02:45:38,819
listens.

2949
02:45:39,760 --> 02:45:40,559
Why can't I be both?

2950
02:45:44,250 --> 02:45:45,950
You lost me at fursuit.

2951
02:45:45,950 --> 02:45:47,049
I just got distracted.

2952
02:45:47,850 --> 02:45:48,549
I got a hill for you.

2953
02:45:53,260 --> 02:45:56,680
Started thinking about Legoshi first.

2954
02:45:56,879 --> 02:45:59,280
I don't know for them like mascot costume.

2955
02:46:00,799 --> 02:46:03,299
All these archers are dying and I don't know what to all

2956
02:46:03,299 --> 02:46:04,700
the way on the top of the tower.

2957
02:46:12,639 --> 02:46:14,540
We're gonna do a recall on you.

2958
02:46:38,530 --> 02:46:39,629
I am out of money.

2959
02:46:43,719 --> 02:46:45,120
LOL poor.

2960
02:46:49,260 --> 02:46:53,340
If they was they was PvP you'd be in trouble when I go

2961
02:46:53,340 --> 02:46:55,139
sell these giant towers.

2962
02:46:57,100 --> 02:46:57,700
We don't okay.

2963
02:46:57,700 --> 02:46:59,600
We definitely need stuff in here.

2964
02:47:00,100 --> 02:47:01,899
If I'm going to be barricade.

2965
02:47:03,399 --> 02:47:04,600
I'm going to be the barricader.

2966
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:07,799
You need to you need to put some stuff in the middle here

2967
02:47:09,219 --> 02:47:11,319
as it kind of just waltzing right through.

2968
02:47:21,620 --> 02:47:22,620
I'm having some trouble.

2969
02:47:23,219 --> 02:47:23,920
Oh, he died.

2970
02:47:29,909 --> 02:47:30,709
I just need a minute.

2971
02:47:31,620 --> 02:47:32,120
Take your time.

2972
02:47:32,319 --> 02:47:32,719
Good time.

2973
02:47:40,309 --> 02:47:41,610
Mods ban me perma.

2974
02:47:41,610 --> 02:47:47,950
I am bored as a raider from Doug Doug said that.

2975
02:47:53,879 --> 02:47:54,479
I'm gonna sell on you.

2976
02:47:58,360 --> 02:47:59,159
No.

2977
02:48:03,180 --> 02:48:03,379
Okay.

2978
02:48:03,379 --> 02:48:04,280
I'm turn it up.

2979
02:48:10,709 --> 02:48:13,909
So what does the big the big block thing here?

2980
02:48:13,909 --> 02:48:15,010
What does it even do?

2981
02:48:16,110 --> 02:48:21,510
The big block thing this huge like the tower you can build

2982
02:48:21,510 --> 02:48:23,610
things on the top of the tree house and the portal takes

2983
02:48:23,610 --> 02:48:24,409
you to the top of it.

2984
02:48:25,950 --> 02:48:28,450
I was putting archers on the top but they were still dying.

2985
02:48:29,450 --> 02:48:30,450
So I gave up.

2986
02:48:32,299 --> 02:48:34,399
I'm ready waiting for player.

2987
02:48:35,100 --> 02:48:36,399
Is that you are you player?

2988
02:48:37,200 --> 02:48:39,700
Yeah, once more into the breach.

2989
02:48:45,299 --> 02:48:46,600
Are you in the cannon?

2990
02:48:47,200 --> 02:48:49,760
No, it's a very expensive thing.

2991
02:48:49,760 --> 02:48:51,260
That's just sitting there as a giant.

2992
02:48:51,260 --> 02:48:53,559
You're not you you're not using it.

2993
02:48:54,059 --> 02:48:55,059
I can come use it.

2994
02:48:55,760 --> 02:48:56,659
I gotta get it.

2995
02:48:57,790 --> 02:49:06,620
I gotta get you.

2996
02:49:06,620 --> 02:49:09,520
Oh my god, you have so there are so many archers up there.

2997
02:49:09,520 --> 02:49:10,420
It looks like a joke.

2998
02:49:10,420 --> 02:49:12,120
It looks like you spawned him in like gmod.

2999
02:49:13,819 --> 02:49:15,120
Way too many up there.

3000
02:49:15,219 --> 02:49:16,120
Can they even shoot?

3001
02:49:17,489 --> 02:49:17,989
I don't know.

3002
02:49:18,690 --> 02:49:27,530
Yeah, they're like shooting like big volleys starting to

3003
02:49:27,530 --> 02:49:49,450
get through a little have gotten that think we're all right

3004
02:49:49,450 --> 02:49:51,450
as long as we just focus on the bridge.

3005
02:49:53,190 --> 02:49:56,729
Keep your eyes on the prize which is winning.

3006
02:50:00,840 --> 02:50:02,340
We should play plate up again.

3007
02:50:02,940 --> 02:50:03,840
Did we beat the game?

3008
02:50:08,079 --> 02:50:09,479
I mean, there's a lot more to it.

3009
02:50:09,979 --> 02:50:11,879
Oh this other we did win a run.

3010
02:50:13,479 --> 02:50:13,879
I forgot.

3011
02:50:13,879 --> 02:50:15,479
It's like a kind of like Binding of Isaac.

3012
02:50:17,399 --> 02:50:18,799
You just do it again.

3013
02:50:45,690 --> 02:50:46,389
Nice shot.

3014
02:50:47,639 --> 02:50:48,440
Thanks pal.

3015
02:50:48,739 --> 02:50:49,540
I really mean it.

3016
02:50:49,540 --> 02:50:53,079
You killed like 10 things or more.

3017
02:50:55,000 --> 02:51:12,540
I'm unleashing my fury unleashing my rage.

3018
02:51:17,510 --> 02:51:18,010
We got him.

3019
02:51:20,290 --> 02:51:22,889
So that's that's a fusion flower.

3020
02:51:23,389 --> 02:51:24,989
Yeah, I don't know what it's doing to him.

3021
02:51:24,989 --> 02:51:26,989
Honestly, I think it's like it's confusing him.

3022
02:51:27,190 --> 02:51:32,389
It looks like it's eating them or something hard to tell.

3023
02:51:32,590 --> 02:51:35,389
I think it's like eating them and then spitting them out.

3024
02:51:36,870 --> 02:51:37,969
I mean, I think they're just dying.

3025
02:51:38,469 --> 02:51:40,770
It says that it would confuse them for a while.

3026
02:51:41,370 --> 02:51:41,870
Oh, no, no, no.

3027
02:51:41,870 --> 02:51:42,069
Okay.

3028
02:51:42,069 --> 02:51:43,870
It's not like I thought it was closing around them.

3029
02:51:43,870 --> 02:51:56,899
I think it's just when it opens it puts out like a nice.

3030
02:51:56,899 --> 02:51:57,200
All right.

3031
02:51:57,200 --> 02:51:57,500
Cool.

3032
02:51:58,989 --> 02:52:01,989
Do you think do we need more damage down this kind of these

3033
02:52:01,989 --> 02:52:03,590
rows or do we need them to be slower?

3034
02:52:03,989 --> 02:52:11,790
I think we're set which one you know what you choose.

3035
02:52:11,889 --> 02:52:14,690
You know, I can't I can't make this pizza for you.

3036
02:52:14,690 --> 02:52:15,389
I'm going damage.

3037
02:52:17,620 --> 02:52:19,420
Oh, that's going to be scream.

3038
02:52:32,620 --> 02:52:33,920
That's a lot of archer player.

3039
02:52:34,420 --> 02:52:35,920
I would just say I'm just making sure we're good.

3040
02:52:50,430 --> 02:52:51,129
This is oh, man.

3041
02:52:51,129 --> 02:52:52,530
This is a lot like home is deep.

3042
02:52:53,229 --> 02:53:02,819
Well, now it is that should hit a lot.

3043
02:53:03,219 --> 02:53:06,780
What?

3044
02:53:08,610 --> 02:53:09,909
Wait, what?

3045
02:53:10,709 --> 02:53:43,829
Wait, what you hit me really guys reference reference reference

3046
02:53:43,829 --> 02:53:44,229
reference.

3047
02:53:44,229 --> 02:53:47,229
He made a reference reference reference reference reference.

3048
02:53:48,229 --> 02:53:49,729
Wait attack me.

3049
02:53:49,930 --> 02:53:50,229
What?

3050
02:53:51,110 --> 02:53:51,309
All right.

3051
02:53:51,309 --> 02:53:51,909
I gotta get up.

3052
02:54:00,909 --> 02:54:04,309
The archers really do rain just absolute hell down.

3053
02:54:06,079 --> 02:54:06,479
Yeah.

3054
02:54:08,379 --> 02:54:31,500
I think I'm just going to keep buying archers totally under

3055
02:54:31,500 --> 02:54:32,200
control.

3056
02:54:32,799 --> 02:54:35,600
We actually do have it completely under control.

3057
02:54:35,600 --> 02:54:36,000
You're right.

3058
02:54:36,899 --> 02:54:38,700
I'm I'm curious.

3059
02:54:39,500 --> 02:54:42,700
It feels like these stages they don't intend for you to like

3060
02:54:43,940 --> 02:54:46,739
it's a big stage for them to just walk to the left and go

3061
02:54:46,739 --> 02:54:49,040
like now let's all go down this one long road.

3062
02:54:50,399 --> 02:54:52,500
But how would how would they not expect that?

3063
02:54:52,700 --> 02:54:53,700
To be what happened?

3064
02:54:54,700 --> 02:54:56,200
Well, I think what this big skeleton.

3065
02:54:57,700 --> 02:55:00,299
I think a lot of it's probably won't they start attacking

3066
02:55:00,299 --> 02:55:02,700
it eventually or they were before what made him attack it

3067
02:55:02,700 --> 02:55:03,000
before.

3068
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:04,000
I have no idea.

3069
02:55:06,739 --> 02:55:08,940
I think the game just wants you to be efficient and says hey

3070
02:55:08,940 --> 02:55:10,040
pick a way to be efficient.

3071
02:55:10,040 --> 02:55:13,479
It doesn't matter how and like will that's fine.

3072
02:55:13,680 --> 02:55:32,430
That's the way that they're going to run every map has

3073
02:55:32,430 --> 02:55:33,729
special challenges.

3074
02:55:34,129 --> 02:55:37,829
Exploding hole Bob's do not reroute so they'll just blow up

3075
02:55:37,829 --> 02:55:38,530
a barricade.

3076
02:55:38,530 --> 02:55:39,129
That's good to know.

3077
02:55:47,700 --> 02:55:49,100
And perhaps that's what happened.

3078
02:55:49,200 --> 02:55:51,899
Does it show like what enemies are in the next wave?

3079
02:55:52,200 --> 02:55:56,000
It does on the screen before we start it shows a list of

3080
02:55:56,000 --> 02:55:56,700
everything that's in it.

3081
02:55:58,950 --> 02:56:00,649
Should I start making archers too for fun?

3082
02:56:01,620 --> 02:56:03,819
How much money do you have 4300?

3083
02:56:05,909 --> 02:56:08,440
Yeah, I think you can put some up here.

3084
02:56:09,409 --> 02:56:10,209
You know, I'll do it.

3085
02:56:10,709 --> 02:56:11,309
I'm already here.

3086
02:56:17,420 --> 02:56:17,819
I'm ready.

3087
02:56:27,409 --> 02:56:29,610
You can play the hard mode now by the way.

3088
02:56:30,610 --> 02:56:31,309
We should try it.

3089
02:56:32,889 --> 02:56:33,190
Oh shit.

3090
02:56:33,190 --> 02:56:33,989
It's Corvash.

3091
02:56:35,149 --> 02:56:38,750
Corvash Corvash Corvash Corvash Corvash Corvash Corvash Corvash

3092
02:56:39,250 --> 02:56:42,149
shameless stolen nemesis system.

3093
02:56:51,020 --> 02:56:54,889
I'm looking forward to the Wonder Woman game made by the

3094
02:56:54,889 --> 02:56:55,489
same company.

3095
02:56:58,590 --> 02:57:00,489
I didn't even I haven't seen anything of it.

3096
02:57:00,989 --> 02:57:05,290
I don't know if it's been very much shown but made by Monolith.

3097
02:57:05,290 --> 02:57:08,190
So I have pretty good.

3098
02:57:23,100 --> 02:57:25,000
We were just talking shit about this barricade and

3099
02:57:27,200 --> 02:57:28,200
I got a long way to go.

3100
02:57:38,799 --> 02:57:39,799
Oh shit.

3101
02:57:41,299 --> 02:57:41,500
Okay.

3102
02:57:41,500 --> 02:57:42,200
Hold on.

3103
02:57:44,579 --> 02:57:45,479
You got any money?

3104
02:57:46,479 --> 02:57:47,280
Enough to do that.

3105
02:57:54,649 --> 02:57:55,450
Oh shit.

3106
02:58:03,370 --> 02:58:06,510
Okay, we can lose one to the other ones are starting to

3107
02:58:06,510 --> 02:58:07,510
get through on the other side.

3108
02:58:07,610 --> 02:58:09,110
I think we're gonna have to pull back into the room.

3109
02:58:10,149 --> 02:58:13,409
Yeah, but it's just like almost deep.

3110
02:58:18,680 --> 02:58:20,479
Oh, there's so many ways they can come in here.

3111
02:58:27,319 --> 02:58:28,420
Oh, Gorbache is coming.

3112
02:58:28,420 --> 02:58:30,020
That's why Gorbache destroyed.

3113
02:58:30,020 --> 02:58:31,420
Oh, Gorbache did it.

3114
02:58:32,559 --> 02:58:33,459
I think we lose.

3115
02:58:34,159 --> 02:58:34,760
No, we're fine.

3116
02:58:37,260 --> 02:58:38,159
Just stop crying.

3117
02:58:43,879 --> 02:58:51,670
Don't let them in.

3118
02:58:55,879 --> 02:58:58,180
Oh, he's just going around and breaking all of your barricades.

3119
02:58:58,180 --> 02:58:59,280
He doesn't care about anything else.

3120
02:59:05,909 --> 02:59:08,010
Okay, any stragglers are gonna get caught.

3121
02:59:08,409 --> 02:59:10,610
He's kind of just no standing over there.

3122
02:59:12,559 --> 02:59:13,860
Do we got to go Gorbache him?

3123
02:59:13,959 --> 02:59:18,260
I think I know he's going all the way back to destroy the

3124
02:59:18,260 --> 02:59:18,860
other barricade.

3125
02:59:18,860 --> 02:59:19,959
He's not even part of the fight.

3126
02:59:20,360 --> 02:59:22,760
He's slowly going to destroy the other barricade.

3127
02:59:23,760 --> 02:59:24,459
Is he dead?

3128
02:59:24,760 --> 02:59:26,159
Your archers killed him.

3129
02:59:26,860 --> 02:59:27,459
Nice.

3130
02:59:29,340 --> 02:59:30,040
What an idiot.

3131
02:59:30,540 --> 02:59:31,340
They could have won this.

3132
02:59:31,340 --> 02:59:32,040
They had it right there.

3133
02:59:32,040 --> 02:59:32,840
They had it in the bag.

3134
02:59:34,129 --> 02:59:35,829
They couldn't win it because I was here.

3135
02:59:37,379 --> 02:59:37,680
True.

3136
02:59:39,200 --> 02:59:40,600
I wasn't going to make the archers.

3137
02:59:46,799 --> 02:59:48,299
You don't provide these quicker.

3138
02:59:53,879 --> 02:59:54,079
Hold on.

3139
02:59:54,079 --> 02:59:54,680
Stay alive.

3140
02:59:54,680 --> 02:59:55,680
I can go like this.

3141
02:59:59,950 --> 03:00:01,250
Yo, are you the lightning guy?

3142
03:00:01,850 --> 03:00:03,149
I have lightning on my staff.

3143
03:00:06,479 --> 03:00:08,680
Are you going to be the frostfire lightning wizard?

3144
03:00:10,780 --> 03:00:12,079
You could just use stick.

3145
03:00:27,909 --> 03:00:31,010
I do literally force for so easy.

3146
03:00:35,149 --> 03:00:37,750
We could make nights nights.

3147
03:00:38,149 --> 03:00:40,350
You could probably do a whole you could do like a whole

3148
03:00:40,350 --> 03:00:41,049
chessboard.

3149
03:00:47,649 --> 03:00:48,950
It's like the power sword.

3150
03:00:50,670 --> 03:00:51,870
I want the flame thing.

3151
03:00:58,180 --> 03:00:59,979
Well, I'm going to upgrade the scorcher.

3152
03:01:08,680 --> 03:01:14,670
I'm going to save my points giant killer beehive tree.

3153
03:01:18,940 --> 03:01:19,840
I didn't okay.

3154
03:01:19,840 --> 03:01:21,639
You need to like let me know when you're going to skip.

3155
03:01:22,239 --> 03:01:25,739
I keep I have I have no control over it and you just like

3156
03:01:25,739 --> 03:01:26,639
don't like me.

3157
03:01:27,639 --> 03:01:28,739
I keep forgetting period.

3158
03:01:28,739 --> 03:01:29,340
I keep forgetting.

3159
03:01:29,340 --> 03:01:30,239
That's not already up.

3160
03:01:30,540 --> 03:01:33,540
You think it's already up afraid of what he might do.

3161
03:01:34,040 --> 03:01:36,639
So what was the point of that story again?

3162
03:01:36,940 --> 03:01:39,440
The gigantic orc army's genius.

3163
03:01:39,840 --> 03:01:42,540
They haven't been seen since the days of Master Cygnus and

3164
03:01:42,540 --> 03:01:44,739
Borwick and now they're back.

3165
03:01:45,239 --> 03:01:46,440
Kelsey has it right.

3166
03:01:46,440 --> 03:01:47,540
This is a bigger spike wall.

3167
03:01:48,739 --> 03:01:52,340
I think that one swivels out like spins out to create armies

3168
03:01:52,340 --> 03:01:53,840
and hits things and push them back.

3169
03:01:54,940 --> 03:01:56,239
We've got this sorceress.

3170
03:01:56,239 --> 03:01:57,040
How does this work?

3171
03:01:58,040 --> 03:01:59,440
This is like supposed to be a fire.

3172
03:01:59,440 --> 03:02:02,639
Is it what direction is this the right direction?

3173
03:02:05,290 --> 03:02:05,590
I don't know.

3174
03:02:05,590 --> 03:02:07,819
I don't know friend.

3175
03:02:07,920 --> 03:02:09,620
All right, so I don't know pal.

3176
03:02:09,920 --> 03:02:12,319
We got to figure out what we want to do here.

3177
03:02:12,920 --> 03:02:14,020
And what are we going to do?

3178
03:02:16,360 --> 03:02:17,360
I'm going to build ladies.

3179
03:02:18,270 --> 03:02:21,469
Yes, but I'm making barricades and I didn't know where they

3180
03:02:21,469 --> 03:02:22,069
should go.

3181
03:02:25,819 --> 03:02:31,959
Looks like I mean down here where the stairs go.

3182
03:02:35,459 --> 03:02:37,959
Oh, there's a whole second floor man, and it's complicated.

3183
03:02:37,959 --> 03:02:39,559
It's like a it's like a hitman level.

3184
03:02:41,920 --> 03:02:46,219
There's two paths like a hitman level man.

3185
03:02:47,979 --> 03:02:52,559
What do you say that for a change of pace?

3186
03:02:52,659 --> 03:02:57,260
Sure, we defend here and then like defend outward rather

3187
03:02:57,260 --> 03:02:58,659
than like make a barricade.

3188
03:02:59,399 --> 03:03:03,000
So you mean we could just barricade like one path barricade

3189
03:03:03,000 --> 03:03:04,700
a path and then go for it from there.

3190
03:03:04,700 --> 03:03:06,799
No, no, I was talking about the opposite like let's make

3191
03:03:06,799 --> 03:03:08,700
this the kill room of death.

3192
03:03:08,799 --> 03:03:09,799
Okay, this is the kill room.

3193
03:03:10,500 --> 03:03:13,000
Yeah, I feel like that's kind of scary considering

3194
03:03:13,000 --> 03:03:15,870
how close we are to the thing.

3195
03:03:17,760 --> 03:03:18,459
I'm not afraid.

3196
03:03:18,459 --> 03:03:19,260
Are you afraid?

3197
03:03:20,030 --> 03:03:23,100
Maybe a little I want you to be a little bit of wait.

3198
03:03:23,100 --> 03:03:24,100
Can't we put on hard mode?

3199
03:03:24,100 --> 03:03:27,219
They were saying you think we're ready for that right now.

3200
03:03:28,270 --> 03:03:29,370
I think we're ready for that right now.

3201
03:03:31,459 --> 03:03:31,659
All right.

3202
03:03:31,659 --> 03:03:31,959
How about this?

3203
03:03:31,959 --> 03:03:34,260
Do you want to take like a BRB go pee get like some water

3204
03:03:34,260 --> 03:03:36,729
and come out and put it in hard mode?

3205
03:03:39,290 --> 03:03:42,270
Okay, you can do it in level select.

3206
03:03:42,569 --> 03:03:43,069
Oh, okay.

3207
03:03:44,180 --> 03:03:45,780
Well, okay, let's do that.

3208
03:03:45,780 --> 03:03:49,329
And then I can even upgrade my stuff for a change.

3209
03:03:49,430 --> 03:03:53,149
Okay, so I just five minutes.

3210
03:03:53,690 --> 03:03:55,989
Okay piss master in five minutes.

3211
03:08:51,149 --> 03:08:51,450
Okay.

3212
03:08:51,950 --> 03:08:52,250
Hello.

3213
03:08:55,739 --> 03:08:56,340
Hey there.

3214
03:08:59,739 --> 03:09:03,079
So I just want to make sure of ladies and gentlemen,

3215
03:09:03,479 --> 03:09:07,120
if you could please hold your attention for one moment

3216
03:09:07,559 --> 03:09:11,739
at the end of this broadcast, we will be watching stir play

3217
03:09:11,739 --> 03:09:12,340
five.

3218
03:09:12,639 --> 03:09:14,100
Wait, what?

3219
03:09:16,209 --> 03:09:24,530
Okay, so we will be we're going to watch stir play five

3220
03:09:24,530 --> 03:09:26,600
nights at Freddy's when we're done.

3221
03:09:26,600 --> 03:09:28,299
When I mean, I'm still having fun doing this.

3222
03:09:28,299 --> 03:09:30,879
But I just want to make sure you understand the what's

3223
03:09:30,879 --> 03:09:32,479
on the plan for today.

3224
03:09:33,399 --> 03:09:36,500
Stir will be going through five nights at Freddy's and five

3225
03:09:36,500 --> 03:09:44,020
nights at Freddy's to stir will be playing his choice of

3226
03:09:44,020 --> 03:09:47,319
five nights at Freddy's one or five nights at Freddy's two.

3227
03:09:51,450 --> 03:09:54,750
This will be determined by a poll in stirs chat.

3228
03:09:59,260 --> 03:09:59,860
Is this a lie?

3229
03:09:59,860 --> 03:10:02,680
No, no, this is real.

3230
03:10:04,500 --> 03:10:04,700
All right.

3231
03:10:04,700 --> 03:10:05,399
Let me re-invite you.

3232
03:10:08,530 --> 03:10:09,129
Wait, wait, wait.

3233
03:10:09,229 --> 03:10:09,729
What do you mean?

3234
03:10:11,840 --> 03:10:15,139
Don't we have to go back though to put the difficulty?

3235
03:10:17,709 --> 03:10:20,510
Yeah, we have to remake the game because we have the

3236
03:10:20,510 --> 03:10:21,209
wrong difficulty.

3237
03:10:21,979 --> 03:10:23,379
Do you actually want to play this on hard?

3238
03:10:24,620 --> 03:10:24,920
Okay.

3239
03:10:24,920 --> 03:10:27,020
Well, then let me let me re-invite you.

3240
03:10:28,719 --> 03:10:29,620
Oh, they can't hear you.

3241
03:10:30,120 --> 03:10:30,620
I keep doing that.

3242
03:10:30,620 --> 03:10:34,420
Oh, you should really just trust me.

3243
03:10:35,559 --> 03:10:40,579
You should like not feel like you need to like, I don't

3244
03:10:40,579 --> 03:10:40,879
know.

3245
03:10:41,280 --> 03:10:42,979
So like I'm not a child.

3246
03:10:43,180 --> 03:10:44,780
We're on War Mage right now.

3247
03:10:45,440 --> 03:10:48,340
Yeah, we are moving to Rift Lord, which is enemies are

3248
03:10:48,340 --> 03:10:48,940
stronger.

3249
03:10:48,940 --> 03:10:51,040
There's left less time between waves.

3250
03:10:51,620 --> 03:10:55,819
They carry shields and we have half as many rift points.

3251
03:10:55,920 --> 03:10:57,319
So instead of 20, we'll have 10.

3252
03:10:59,270 --> 03:10:59,670
Okay.

3253
03:10:59,969 --> 03:11:00,270
Okay.

3254
03:11:01,319 --> 03:11:01,520
All right.

3255
03:11:01,520 --> 03:11:02,420
Now let me get you invited.

3256
03:11:04,760 --> 03:11:06,360
I think I'm still with you.

3257
03:11:07,750 --> 03:11:08,149
You are.

3258
03:11:08,819 --> 03:11:09,120
Okay.

3259
03:11:09,120 --> 03:11:11,120
And yeah, we can see that the bomber guys are on this

3260
03:11:11,120 --> 03:11:11,620
stage.

3261
03:11:13,000 --> 03:11:15,829
Oh, okay.

3262
03:11:15,829 --> 03:11:17,129
Well, let's get our ass kicked.

3263
03:11:17,959 --> 03:11:18,959
No, we're gonna do great.

3264
03:11:19,360 --> 03:11:21,860
We're gonna rise to the occasion and we're gonna kill

3265
03:11:21,860 --> 03:11:23,059
guys with your guns.

3266
03:11:31,670 --> 03:11:35,790
So actually which one should stir play first one or the

3267
03:11:35,790 --> 03:11:36,190
second one?

3268
03:11:37,760 --> 03:11:38,959
I would say two, right?

3269
03:11:41,540 --> 03:11:42,940
I may have them both.

3270
03:11:42,940 --> 03:11:43,840
So I don't know.

3271
03:11:43,840 --> 03:11:46,940
There were rumors that master sickness banished him from

3272
03:11:46,940 --> 03:11:49,540
the order afraid of what he might do.

3273
03:11:50,040 --> 03:11:52,540
So what was the point of that story again?

3274
03:11:52,840 --> 03:11:55,440
The gigantic orc army's genius.

3275
03:11:55,739 --> 03:11:58,340
They haven't been seen since the days of master sickness

3276
03:11:58,340 --> 03:12:00,739
in Borwick and now they're back.

3277
03:12:01,639 --> 03:12:02,040
What?

3278
03:12:02,840 --> 03:12:06,040
These new rift rifts are what smaller or why are you

3279
03:12:06,040 --> 03:12:06,739
yelling?

3280
03:12:07,040 --> 03:12:10,340
Just scratching my chest since Borwick's time.

3281
03:12:10,840 --> 03:12:12,340
We've got this sorceress.

3282
03:12:12,540 --> 03:12:13,639
Let's turn it up.

3283
03:12:14,639 --> 03:12:16,239
I'm same strat.

3284
03:12:16,239 --> 03:12:17,540
We're not going to do a snake.

3285
03:12:17,940 --> 03:12:21,940
Okay, I just wanted to they were talking so same strat.

3286
03:12:21,940 --> 03:12:24,639
So we're just gonna I'm building up here on one side.

3287
03:12:25,659 --> 03:12:30,100
You build on the other side the other door this door and

3288
03:12:30,100 --> 03:12:31,899
we're just to go in you handle that corner.

3289
03:12:31,899 --> 03:12:35,290
I'll handle my corner and this is just whoever is doing

3290
03:12:35,290 --> 03:12:37,129
better wins.

3291
03:12:39,700 --> 03:12:42,000
I don't know what directions needs to face.

3292
03:12:45,389 --> 03:12:50,500
Do you face grill out or grill grill in or grill out?

3293
03:12:51,799 --> 03:12:54,750
I don't think you should call them that it's real.

3294
03:12:54,750 --> 03:13:00,760
Oh, it's this way the grill shoots the fire out.

3295
03:13:00,760 --> 03:13:00,959
Okay.

3296
03:13:00,959 --> 03:13:01,959
I wonder how what the range is.

3297
03:13:02,459 --> 03:13:03,159
We'll find out.

3298
03:13:06,000 --> 03:13:07,200
I don't know.

3299
03:13:07,200 --> 03:13:07,899
It's hard to say.

3300
03:13:09,030 --> 03:13:09,829
I'll figure it out.

3301
03:13:11,530 --> 03:13:11,829
Okay.

3302
03:13:11,829 --> 03:13:12,229
I'm ready.

3303
03:13:17,020 --> 03:13:17,819
Okay ready.

3304
03:13:18,620 --> 03:13:19,819
This is what this game is.

3305
03:13:19,819 --> 03:13:20,420
I had no idea.

3306
03:13:20,420 --> 03:13:21,120
This looks fun.

3307
03:13:21,219 --> 03:13:21,719
Yeah, it is fun.

3308
03:13:23,219 --> 03:13:26,319
This is more like the first second game.

3309
03:13:27,260 --> 03:13:29,059
Although I don't remember I could be just making that

3310
03:13:29,059 --> 03:13:31,659
enemies are preparing to breach one of our gates.

3311
03:13:32,260 --> 03:13:34,760
They've broken through a gate not about the same.

3312
03:13:41,979 --> 03:13:43,280
Oh, they do have shields.

3313
03:13:45,010 --> 03:14:17,309
They do exist only hurting me.

3314
03:14:21,370 --> 03:14:25,959
Oh, see we didn't even need traps this level.

3315
03:14:26,760 --> 03:14:28,459
I mean big guy getting through.

3316
03:14:32,590 --> 03:14:36,389
There is what we lost one.

3317
03:14:36,389 --> 03:14:37,590
I think a runner got by.

3318
03:14:38,489 --> 03:14:41,090
Oh, we don't get to say I'm ready.

3319
03:14:41,090 --> 03:14:42,290
We just have to do it.

3320
03:14:43,190 --> 03:14:47,290
Oh, are you serious?

3321
03:14:47,290 --> 03:14:48,190
There's a werewolf.

3322
03:14:48,790 --> 03:14:52,059
They're breaking through you thought I was going to do it.

3323
03:14:57,059 --> 03:14:58,760
There's a there's a lot of big ones coming.

3324
03:15:00,680 --> 03:15:01,579
That's a scary.

3325
03:15:10,139 --> 03:15:14,819
Okay, not as scary as I you got a little.

3326
03:15:16,399 --> 03:15:19,920
Okay, this is a little spooky.

3327
03:15:22,399 --> 03:15:23,299
I got this on the control.

3328
03:15:23,299 --> 03:15:23,700
Don't worry.

3329
03:15:24,889 --> 03:15:27,690
The barricade is under a barricade is down.

3330
03:15:29,899 --> 03:15:30,399
Do you?

3331
03:15:31,459 --> 03:15:32,760
Oh, they destroyed that barricade.

3332
03:15:32,860 --> 03:15:45,059
I think you're letting a few through friend.

3333
03:15:49,200 --> 03:15:50,799
I was doing something very important.

3334
03:15:51,200 --> 03:15:53,799
I think this may be like a reset scenario.

3335
03:15:53,799 --> 03:15:55,600
No, no, no, we're fine.

3336
03:15:55,899 --> 03:16:05,020
Everything is fine through for the bit.

3337
03:16:07,760 --> 03:16:10,059
Yeah, it's a regular Wednesday.

3338
03:16:10,459 --> 03:16:10,860
Okay.

3339
03:16:12,379 --> 03:16:14,180
Enemies in our ripped room.

3340
03:16:23,280 --> 03:16:25,280
No, what's remaining?

3341
03:16:27,340 --> 03:16:28,340
That really okay.

3342
03:16:29,979 --> 03:16:32,780
Okay, not another guy's getting through.

3343
03:16:33,479 --> 03:16:34,180
Am I right?

3344
03:16:35,799 --> 03:16:36,200
You're right.

3345
03:16:53,260 --> 03:16:54,360
I think three more.

3346
03:16:54,659 --> 03:16:55,860
I think this is a reset.

3347
03:16:57,040 --> 03:16:59,639
I think we learned me if we did we learned we learned let him

3348
03:16:59,639 --> 03:17:03,129
in let him in we learned to let him in.

3349
03:17:05,409 --> 03:17:07,409
I don't think this even attacked anyone.

3350
03:17:07,409 --> 03:17:08,510
Nobody even came through here.

3351
03:17:10,750 --> 03:17:12,649
I thought we were doing I thought we were dancing.

3352
03:17:20,319 --> 03:17:21,620
We can't oh, it's on you.

3353
03:17:21,620 --> 03:17:24,760
I guess all right new strategy.

3354
03:17:25,360 --> 03:17:25,860
Mm-hmm.

3355
03:17:28,940 --> 03:17:31,239
I think we got to actually block a path not long.

3356
03:17:31,239 --> 03:17:31,940
I think so too.

3357
03:17:31,940 --> 03:17:36,340
So are we looking at there were rumors that master sickness

3358
03:17:36,340 --> 03:17:39,940
just walk this side here afraid of what he might do.

3359
03:17:40,440 --> 03:17:43,040
So what was the point of that story again?

3360
03:17:43,340 --> 03:17:45,840
The gigantic orc army's genius.

3361
03:17:46,239 --> 03:17:48,840
They haven't been seen since the days of master sickness

3362
03:17:48,840 --> 03:17:52,639
and warwick and now we deal with this should I funnel them

3363
03:17:52,639 --> 03:17:56,540
with more blocks new red or no

3364
03:17:56,540 --> 03:17:58,440
because eventually there are going to be able to destroy

3365
03:17:58,440 --> 03:18:02,139
those so we can't completely rely on that.

3366
03:18:02,340 --> 03:18:03,040
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

3367
03:18:03,040 --> 03:18:03,940
Let's trap it.

3368
03:18:03,940 --> 03:18:04,239
Okay.

3369
03:18:06,440 --> 03:18:06,639
Yeah.

3370
03:18:06,639 --> 03:18:09,540
And eventually we should sell all that.

3371
03:18:09,540 --> 03:18:11,639
Hold on sell all of this.

3372
03:18:14,149 --> 03:18:15,549
We need to block further down.

3373
03:18:28,209 --> 03:18:28,909
Don't slow somewhere.

3374
03:18:28,909 --> 03:18:30,309
And then attacking that's true.

3375
03:18:30,309 --> 03:18:35,850
Then for now, let's focus on defending this stair.

3376
03:18:36,049 --> 03:18:41,309
Okay, so we should probably get a little bit of a block here.

3377
03:18:43,629 --> 03:18:48,329
This is that's that's cut in the corner there.

3378
03:18:48,329 --> 03:18:49,430
So let's go right here.

3379
03:18:52,120 --> 03:18:52,420
Okay.

3380
03:18:52,420 --> 03:18:54,120
First wave wasn't very hard either.

3381
03:18:54,420 --> 03:18:55,819
I think we're good ready to go.

3382
03:18:56,219 --> 03:18:58,819
I think I might have missed something.

3383
03:19:00,920 --> 03:19:02,219
So you want to fight up here, right?

3384
03:19:02,620 --> 03:19:04,719
Yeah, just double-checking.

3385
03:19:05,979 --> 03:19:08,680
Enemies are preparing to breach one of our gates.

3386
03:19:08,780 --> 03:19:11,379
This is sponsor stream.

3387
03:19:11,379 --> 03:19:19,889
What about two bros can't have fun in the game together?

3388
03:19:28,840 --> 03:19:29,940
They instantly broke it.

3389
03:19:30,739 --> 03:19:31,340
They did.

3390
03:19:33,280 --> 03:19:34,879
It's probably one of the Cobalt.

3391
03:19:36,370 --> 03:19:36,770
Yeah.

3392
03:19:37,069 --> 03:19:42,170
Do you have like an instant retry thing we can do or do we

3393
03:19:42,170 --> 03:19:43,170
have to beat us?

3394
03:19:43,270 --> 03:19:44,270
I can just go like this.

3395
03:19:50,389 --> 03:19:52,290
In that case original plan.

3396
03:19:53,760 --> 03:19:57,620
Let's defend the final room and then as we get more money,

3397
03:19:57,620 --> 03:19:58,420
we build out.

3398
03:20:02,049 --> 03:20:03,750
We need just damage damage damage.

3399
03:20:08,149 --> 03:20:10,450
What's the highest damage thing you're up?

3400
03:20:17,649 --> 03:20:18,149
Poison.

3401
03:20:18,149 --> 03:20:20,450
I'm kind of afraid to use poison because it won't last long

3402
03:20:20,450 --> 03:20:20,950
enough, right?

3403
03:20:30,250 --> 03:20:32,450
All right, that's all I can do on this side.

3404
03:20:33,649 --> 03:20:35,750
So we have to put shit here.

3405
03:20:36,750 --> 03:20:38,450
And then they're going to eventually they're going to

3406
03:20:38,450 --> 03:20:39,250
come through here.

3407
03:20:48,450 --> 03:20:49,850
Rotate the jump pads.

3408
03:20:51,149 --> 03:20:53,450
The these are fire flame pads.

3409
03:20:54,120 --> 03:20:56,549
So they shoot fire up.

3410
03:20:56,850 --> 03:21:03,010
It's backwards.

3411
03:21:06,809 --> 03:21:09,979
You get what are these fire things do?

3412
03:21:11,319 --> 03:21:13,920
They when people get close enough that lifts up and breathes

3413
03:21:13,920 --> 03:21:19,719
fire in their face and the slow trap increases fire damage

3414
03:21:19,719 --> 03:21:24,100
taken and I don't know if I have the right way or not,

3415
03:21:24,100 --> 03:21:26,500
but people are saying the grill out.

3416
03:21:27,299 --> 03:21:29,600
I imagine the way the arrows pointing.

3417
03:21:30,200 --> 03:21:31,100
That's what I thought too.

3418
03:21:31,100 --> 03:21:33,399
But if I spin it the other way, the grill is facing the

3419
03:21:33,399 --> 03:21:34,100
other direction.

3420
03:21:36,479 --> 03:21:37,180
That looks right.

3421
03:21:37,180 --> 03:21:38,379
The way that looks right.

3422
03:21:38,379 --> 03:21:39,680
I believe we'll find out.

3423
03:21:40,379 --> 03:21:42,479
Okay, we'll find out just know that we can't like sell in

3424
03:21:42,479 --> 03:21:45,840
between rounds anymore because there's no in between rounds.

3425
03:21:47,549 --> 03:21:48,649
So it better be right.

3426
03:21:48,649 --> 03:21:50,750
It better be freaking right.

3427
03:21:50,950 --> 03:21:51,450
Let's go.

3428
03:21:56,299 --> 03:21:57,200
Yo, let's get it.

3429
03:22:05,110 --> 03:22:07,510
Enemies are preparing to breach one of our gates.

3430
03:22:07,510 --> 03:22:08,309
So the game is hard.

3431
03:22:08,809 --> 03:22:09,709
The game is challenging.

3432
03:22:12,270 --> 03:22:12,569
We get it.

3433
03:22:12,569 --> 03:22:13,469
They're going to dig on the other way.

3434
03:22:15,709 --> 03:22:16,409
We're going to go back up.

3435
03:22:30,079 --> 03:22:30,680
No, that's correct.

3436
03:22:30,680 --> 03:22:30,979
All right.

3437
03:22:31,079 --> 03:22:32,479
I want to make sure it's right.

3438
03:22:33,280 --> 03:22:41,420
Okay, I think they're getting up the other way.

3439
03:22:41,819 --> 03:22:42,219
They are.

3440
03:22:42,819 --> 03:22:43,219
There are.

3441
03:22:46,850 --> 03:22:48,950
There are enemies in our rift room.

3442
03:22:48,950 --> 03:22:49,850
Don't do it.

3443
03:22:50,250 --> 03:22:50,649
I got it.

3444
03:22:50,649 --> 03:22:51,049
I got it.

3445
03:22:53,309 --> 03:22:55,709
I will be rift room protector for now.

3446
03:22:56,409 --> 03:22:59,610
Okay, I will be out in the world.

3447
03:23:00,010 --> 03:23:19,409
Trying to thin the herd as possible as much if you're not you're

3448
03:23:19,409 --> 03:23:20,110
having trouble.

3449
03:23:20,110 --> 03:23:20,709
Let me know.

3450
03:23:21,110 --> 03:23:25,510
I'm okay for now, but I imagine in about five seconds that will

3451
03:23:25,510 --> 03:23:25,909
change.

3452
03:23:26,989 --> 03:23:29,489
There's also like teleport back to the room trinkets that you

3453
03:23:29,489 --> 03:23:33,090
can buy that I just never bought because it was easy before

3454
03:23:33,090 --> 03:23:33,389
this.

3455
03:23:35,979 --> 03:23:36,680
We're okay so far.

3456
03:23:41,200 --> 03:23:41,500
Okay.

3457
03:23:41,500 --> 03:23:43,600
I'm imagining we need some of this shit right here.

3458
03:23:51,190 --> 03:23:53,389
Enemies are breaking through elsewhere.

3459
03:23:54,090 --> 03:23:54,690
Look out.

3460
03:23:54,790 --> 03:23:56,989
Our defenses have been breached again.

3461
03:24:00,950 --> 03:24:01,950
Wait spray fire.

3462
03:24:01,950 --> 03:24:02,250
Why?

3463
03:24:02,250 --> 03:24:02,850
What are you doing?

3464
03:24:02,850 --> 03:24:04,450
Oh, it's the wrong way.

3465
03:24:04,450 --> 03:24:05,149
Oh my god.

3466
03:24:05,149 --> 03:24:06,250
I got so in my own head.

3467
03:24:08,059 --> 03:24:10,059
Oh shoot.

3468
03:24:18,360 --> 03:24:19,360
Uh-oh.

3469
03:24:37,200 --> 03:24:39,760
Oh, we're good.

3470
03:24:41,229 --> 03:24:41,729
We're okay.

3471
03:24:46,670 --> 03:24:49,270
This map is it is hard to tell like where everything is because

3472
03:24:49,270 --> 03:24:51,270
it all goes over top of each other.

3473
03:25:06,459 --> 03:25:10,159
I wonder if I can spin that around in the next like 3 2 1

3474
03:25:11,459 --> 03:25:12,059
room.

3475
03:25:20,450 --> 03:25:21,350
There's a lot of people in here.

3476
03:25:22,450 --> 03:25:23,250
If you're not busy.

3477
03:25:23,450 --> 03:25:24,250
I think I got it.

3478
03:25:32,079 --> 03:25:33,180
Big guy coming.

3479
03:25:36,489 --> 03:25:37,389
Oh that hurt.

3480
03:25:38,290 --> 03:25:39,290
Meth Lord.

3481
03:25:51,659 --> 03:25:52,059
There we go.

3482
03:25:52,059 --> 03:25:52,360
Okay.

3483
03:25:52,360 --> 03:25:53,360
At least one of them is right.

3484
03:26:00,229 --> 03:26:01,329
Sure gamer face.

3485
03:26:04,090 --> 03:26:04,989
What's going on with this thing?

3486
03:26:11,200 --> 03:26:13,399
This guy needs to shut up about them being in our room.

3487
03:26:14,399 --> 03:26:17,100
He is not matching the vibe.

3488
03:26:17,500 --> 03:26:18,600
It's a long cooldown.

3489
03:26:19,100 --> 03:26:19,700
God damn it.

3490
03:26:19,700 --> 03:26:20,500
I had a chance.

3491
03:26:20,500 --> 03:26:22,000
I that was two seconds.

3492
03:26:29,000 --> 03:26:30,700
Oh, it gives you like two seconds to sell.

3493
03:26:32,020 --> 03:26:33,719
Yeah, that was not very much time at all.

3494
03:26:36,360 --> 03:26:39,620
What is what is the yellow on the mini-map?

3495
03:26:39,620 --> 03:26:41,120
Oh, it's all these things.

3496
03:26:45,219 --> 03:26:46,719
All right, so the yellow on the mini-map that's good.

3497
03:27:01,799 --> 03:27:02,299
Oh boy.

3498
03:27:03,000 --> 03:27:11,940
Amazing.

3499
03:27:19,540 --> 03:27:20,739
They're a little spooky.

3500
03:27:21,540 --> 03:27:22,540
We're anything.

3501
03:27:26,920 --> 03:27:27,719
Could be way worse.

3502
03:27:43,680 --> 03:27:44,479
Yeah, your tar trap.

3503
03:27:44,479 --> 03:27:46,680
That's actually set up the right way is doing a lot over here.

3504
03:27:50,930 --> 03:27:51,829
Oh, you need help.

3505
03:27:52,329 --> 03:27:54,030
There's a lot of big guys coming over here too.

3506
03:28:05,770 --> 03:28:06,469
Man.

3507
03:28:14,879 --> 03:28:16,680
Yeah, this isn't a bad strap, but it's scary.

3508
03:28:18,180 --> 03:28:19,379
No one got in.

3509
03:28:19,680 --> 03:28:20,379
I really see him.

3510
03:28:20,680 --> 03:28:21,280
Oh shit.

3511
03:28:22,440 --> 03:28:23,340
She it was a cheater though.

3512
03:28:23,340 --> 03:28:24,239
So I don't worry about it.

3513
03:28:24,340 --> 03:28:25,139
He was just cheating.

3514
03:28:36,180 --> 03:28:38,579
He really is saying that every three seconds.

3515
03:28:40,770 --> 03:28:41,569
I can tell you this much.

3516
03:28:41,569 --> 03:28:42,770
There's enemies in our riff room.

3517
03:28:53,790 --> 03:28:54,790
Okay, she didn't know.

3518
03:29:01,270 --> 03:29:01,670
I got it.

3519
03:29:02,170 --> 03:29:02,670
Thank goodness.

3520
03:29:03,469 --> 03:29:03,969
I'm gonna.

3521
03:29:05,170 --> 03:29:05,969
It was going the right way.

3522
03:29:05,969 --> 03:29:06,469
It'd be good.

3523
03:29:13,709 --> 03:29:13,909
All right.

3524
03:29:13,909 --> 03:29:30,719
This room should be pretty protected guys.

3525
03:29:30,719 --> 03:29:32,219
I think there's enemies in the rift room.

3526
03:29:32,219 --> 03:29:44,120
I feel like there are going to keep that like I really feel like

3527
03:29:44,120 --> 03:29:46,219
I could just keep building archers in this room.

3528
03:29:47,120 --> 03:29:48,620
Just keep freezing stuff.

3529
03:29:48,719 --> 03:29:49,719
Oh fast.

3530
03:29:53,680 --> 03:29:55,180
Maybe I don't know what just happened.

3531
03:29:55,680 --> 03:29:58,280
I wonder if we should build a barricade like in the corner as

3532
03:29:58,280 --> 03:30:03,600
like they go after the archers like no matter what.

3533
03:30:09,440 --> 03:30:11,340
Okay, there is a lot of guys coming.

3534
03:30:11,440 --> 03:30:12,040
Yeah.

3535
03:30:15,059 --> 03:30:16,860
This this is pretty well-defended over her.

3536
03:30:18,799 --> 03:30:19,700
I think we are right.

3537
03:30:21,950 --> 03:30:22,850
I need the sword.

3538
03:30:24,559 --> 03:30:25,760
I wonder if the broadswords any good.

3539
03:30:25,760 --> 03:30:26,559
This thing's great.

3540
03:30:27,559 --> 03:30:28,459
Sounded good.

3541
03:30:38,690 --> 03:30:40,989
I'm just a raid from from the city earlier.

3542
03:30:43,790 --> 03:30:44,989
You're still here from six straight.

3543
03:30:45,690 --> 03:30:47,489
Thanks everybody.

3544
03:30:48,620 --> 03:30:51,219
I don't know if you're still here or not, but missed it.

3545
03:30:56,129 --> 03:30:56,729
Oh shit.

3546
03:30:56,829 --> 03:30:57,430
Oh shit.

3547
03:30:58,329 --> 03:31:00,329
Oh, that's bad.

3548
03:31:00,329 --> 03:31:00,829
It's all right.

3549
03:31:03,219 --> 03:31:05,120
There's still only halfway.

3550
03:31:05,719 --> 03:31:06,920
Well, we are halfway through the level.

3551
03:31:06,920 --> 03:31:07,620
So just.

3552
03:31:08,120 --> 03:31:11,520
Yes, these barricades got blown up and I got to spend all

3553
03:31:11,520 --> 03:31:12,520
that money remaking.

3554
03:31:36,930 --> 03:31:37,530
I got it.

3555
03:31:38,329 --> 03:31:39,030
This back.

3556
03:31:40,329 --> 03:31:41,430
We're going to go like this.

3557
03:31:50,299 --> 03:31:51,600
Where I don't know.

3558
03:31:52,399 --> 03:31:53,899
This guy is freaking me out.

3559
03:31:54,799 --> 03:31:55,799
Where are they?

3560
03:31:57,739 --> 03:31:58,540
Are they going up this way?

3561
03:31:59,040 --> 03:31:59,840
You're going up this left side.

3562
03:32:10,500 --> 03:32:12,299
I don't think I have any of my traps upgraded.

3563
03:32:15,649 --> 03:32:18,149
The slow full upgrade is very useful.

3564
03:32:22,959 --> 03:32:27,979
Now this is fun.

3565
03:32:28,079 --> 03:32:28,780
I like this.

3566
03:32:28,879 --> 03:32:29,979
I like want to play more.

3567
03:32:30,479 --> 03:32:32,979
Yeah, I like sense you being like, oh, let's play five

3568
03:32:32,979 --> 03:32:33,579
minutes of parties.

3569
03:32:33,579 --> 03:32:33,879
Now.

3570
03:32:35,680 --> 03:32:40,739
No, no, I'm good.

3571
03:32:40,739 --> 03:32:41,239
This is fun.

3572
03:32:52,639 --> 03:32:54,940
You can play five minutes of parties in Roblox.

3573
03:32:54,940 --> 03:32:56,739
You can play you can do anything in Roblox.

3574
03:33:00,690 --> 03:33:02,590
I don't know what I would be doing without the frame.

3575
03:33:25,010 --> 03:33:25,709
Just this hallway.

3576
03:33:25,709 --> 03:33:26,010
That's it.

3577
03:33:26,010 --> 03:33:26,510
Nothing else.

3578
03:33:37,020 --> 03:33:38,719
I'll show the Bomber coming in yellow.

3579
03:33:41,520 --> 03:33:43,520
I still don't know what this plan actually does.

3580
03:33:45,049 --> 03:33:46,950
It's not a confusion.

3581
03:33:46,950 --> 03:33:49,250
Whatever it looks like he was making them walk backwards

3582
03:33:49,250 --> 03:33:49,649
there.

3583
03:33:50,920 --> 03:33:52,819
I don't know if they were chasing me or confused.

3584
03:33:52,819 --> 03:33:54,020
Oh, no, they're next wave.

3585
03:33:59,040 --> 03:33:59,440
Shit.

3586
03:34:09,850 --> 03:34:10,649
I'm gonna go the other way.

3587
03:34:10,750 --> 03:34:19,969
Yeah, you fucked it up.

3588
03:34:20,579 --> 03:34:20,979
I'm all right.

3589
03:34:22,159 --> 03:34:24,059
Hey, all matters is that they die.

3590
03:34:24,059 --> 03:34:25,559
It doesn't matter how cleanly it is.

3591
03:34:28,010 --> 03:34:29,610
There are.

3592
03:34:29,610 --> 03:34:30,010
Okay.

3593
03:34:30,510 --> 03:34:30,909
Yeah.

3594
03:34:31,510 --> 03:34:32,209
Yeah, there are.

3595
03:34:32,309 --> 03:34:33,409
Whoa.

3596
03:34:45,079 --> 03:34:45,579
You good?

3597
03:34:47,409 --> 03:34:47,909
Basically.

3598
03:34:49,680 --> 03:34:51,079
There's a lot of people over here.

3599
03:34:52,860 --> 03:34:53,260
Not good.

3600
03:34:53,260 --> 03:34:53,559
Not good.

3601
03:34:53,559 --> 03:34:54,159
Not good.

3602
03:34:54,260 --> 03:34:54,760
All good.

3603
03:34:55,889 --> 03:34:56,889
Oh, not good.

3604
03:34:57,090 --> 03:34:59,190
If you got in we got to rebuild this barricade.

3605
03:35:03,489 --> 03:35:05,989
We got another barricade to rebuild.

3606
03:35:12,500 --> 03:35:14,000
There's so many enemies here.

3607
03:35:14,940 --> 03:35:15,940
Oh my goodness.

3608
03:35:18,750 --> 03:35:19,250
I got you.

3609
03:35:24,180 --> 03:35:26,479
And if I was an orc, I really hope I'm a heavy orc.

3610
03:35:30,879 --> 03:35:32,780
God watchers are smelly.

3611
03:35:35,170 --> 03:35:35,870
Why would you say that?

3612
03:35:35,870 --> 03:35:37,770
No, no.

3613
03:35:37,770 --> 03:35:38,270
What happened?

3614
03:35:38,670 --> 03:35:41,569
The fucking elementals just walk by everything.

3615
03:35:42,489 --> 03:35:44,690
The little tiny elementals kept getting by.

3616
03:35:46,639 --> 03:35:47,040
Shit.

3617
03:35:49,049 --> 03:35:49,350
Shit.

3618
03:35:49,350 --> 03:35:49,850
That was hard.

3619
03:35:52,030 --> 03:35:52,530
Yeah.

3620
03:35:55,920 --> 03:35:56,719
Yeah, it was.

3621
03:35:58,959 --> 03:36:00,399
We going again.

3622
03:36:02,639 --> 03:36:02,840
Yeah.

3623
03:36:02,840 --> 03:36:03,940
Oh, let me buy.

3624
03:36:11,459 --> 03:36:11,860
Okay.

3625
03:36:11,959 --> 03:36:13,360
I got I got what I needed.

3626
03:36:14,940 --> 03:36:16,739
I feel like I want to refund points.

3627
03:36:17,739 --> 03:36:19,139
He wants to refund the game.

3628
03:36:19,139 --> 03:36:20,239
I thought you just said you liked it.

3629
03:36:21,239 --> 03:36:23,239
I think you know, I think I want to refund.

3630
03:36:25,170 --> 03:36:27,670
You know, that makes sense because we've we've just been

3631
03:36:27,670 --> 03:36:30,270
buying like experimental stuff.

3632
03:36:30,270 --> 03:36:34,170
It doesn't refund the stuff that you bought just the upgrades

3633
03:36:34,170 --> 03:36:34,569
for him.

3634
03:36:35,469 --> 03:36:35,969
It's all right.

3635
03:36:40,170 --> 03:36:41,969
We're coming up close on the two hour mark.

3636
03:36:41,969 --> 03:36:43,270
If we could refund real quick.

3637
03:36:43,469 --> 03:36:45,069
It's been way longer than two hours.

3638
03:36:45,770 --> 03:36:46,469
Like four.

3639
03:36:48,170 --> 03:36:50,670
The gigantic Orc army's genius.

3640
03:36:51,069 --> 03:36:53,870
They haven't been seen since the days of Master Cygnus and

3641
03:36:53,870 --> 03:36:54,270
Borewit.

3642
03:36:54,270 --> 03:36:55,270
What are we missing?

3643
03:36:55,270 --> 03:36:56,069
They're back.

3644
03:36:56,569 --> 03:36:57,770
Kelsey has it right.

3645
03:36:58,170 --> 03:36:59,569
These new red wreaths.

3646
03:36:59,569 --> 03:37:00,670
What do we need?

3647
03:37:03,069 --> 03:37:05,270
I am you have Tar.

3648
03:37:05,270 --> 03:37:07,969
Let's I'm gonna not buy shit you already have.

3649
03:37:07,969 --> 03:37:08,969
Let's trap it up.

3650
03:37:10,219 --> 03:37:12,620
Tar and I got these brimstone tiles.

3651
03:37:12,620 --> 03:37:14,819
I'm gonna put at the beginning because it's damage over time.

3652
03:37:15,319 --> 03:37:18,360
So by the time they get to us, hopefully they're less

3653
03:37:19,059 --> 03:37:21,559
strong tar poison and I got the story.

3654
03:37:22,059 --> 03:37:22,659
Oh, you got the sword.

3655
03:37:22,659 --> 03:37:22,959
Okay.

3656
03:37:23,819 --> 03:37:24,819
I feel like you're gonna like it.

3657
03:37:32,030 --> 03:37:33,530
It writ canteen.

3658
03:37:33,530 --> 03:37:34,030
I'm ready.

3659
03:37:37,239 --> 03:37:38,040
But are we ready?

3660
03:37:38,040 --> 03:37:41,040
We're we're we what's are we changing strategy?

3661
03:37:41,040 --> 03:37:42,139
We keeping the same thing going.

3662
03:37:42,139 --> 03:37:42,940
We going back to the rift.

3663
03:37:42,940 --> 03:37:44,639
Oh, we got enemies in the room.

3664
03:37:44,639 --> 03:37:45,239
I don't know.

3665
03:37:45,239 --> 03:37:46,940
I'm putting fire down at the front.

3666
03:37:48,360 --> 03:37:51,760
We could just run door and just kill them as they come

3667
03:37:51,760 --> 03:37:54,059
but but then once the side doors open, we got to change

3668
03:37:54,059 --> 03:37:54,459
strategy.

3669
03:37:55,489 --> 03:37:55,889
Yeah.

3670
03:37:57,780 --> 03:37:58,680
Yeah, delete those.

3671
03:38:00,639 --> 03:38:01,040
Why?

3672
03:38:01,139 --> 03:38:05,969
Because I want to put the slow traps first because then now

3673
03:38:05,969 --> 03:38:06,969
they take more fire damage.

3674
03:38:11,649 --> 03:38:12,049
Okay.

3675
03:38:12,940 --> 03:38:17,020
And then logic and then after they go to the fire, let's

3676
03:38:17,020 --> 03:38:17,920
hit him with the poison.

3677
03:38:19,299 --> 03:38:22,489
Let's say they'll turn this way and let's fuck them up.

3678
03:38:23,190 --> 03:38:27,389
Do you do we know if the the bombers only destroy barricades

3679
03:38:27,389 --> 03:38:30,579
if they're blocking their path or if like I think they

3680
03:38:30,579 --> 03:38:35,739
probably just run right through a barricade because it almost

3681
03:38:35,739 --> 03:38:37,540
seems here like with these pouring things that you would

3682
03:38:37,540 --> 03:38:40,440
want them to walk around this so you can actually make

3683
03:38:40,440 --> 03:38:41,139
use out of it.

3684
03:38:41,139 --> 03:38:43,040
But if you put a barricade here, they're going to instantly

3685
03:38:43,040 --> 03:38:43,739
just blow it up.

3686
03:38:44,139 --> 03:38:49,770
I wonder if maybe we just have to be really diligent about

3687
03:38:49,770 --> 03:38:50,569
when they spawn.

3688
03:39:08,459 --> 03:39:08,860
Okay.

3689
03:39:08,860 --> 03:39:10,159
Yeah, I like this better already.

3690
03:39:12,920 --> 03:39:14,120
The sword is really good.

3691
03:39:15,530 --> 03:39:16,030
Crossover.

3692
03:39:16,729 --> 03:39:17,229
Yeah.

3693
03:39:17,530 --> 03:39:18,629
What is its ability?

3694
03:39:19,329 --> 03:39:21,129
I put down the lightning sword.

3695
03:39:21,829 --> 03:39:22,229
Hold up.

3696
03:39:22,229 --> 03:39:22,930
Stop hitting them.

3697
03:39:28,620 --> 03:39:29,020
Nice.

3698
03:39:29,420 --> 03:39:31,620
Yeah, but I all I had was the bow so I didn't have like when

3699
03:39:31,620 --> 03:39:32,319
they all grouped up.

3700
03:39:32,319 --> 03:39:34,020
I didn't have anything to shoot them.

3701
03:39:43,440 --> 03:39:43,739
All right.

3702
03:39:43,739 --> 03:39:44,139
Look at that.

3703
03:39:44,139 --> 03:39:44,639
We're good.

3704
03:39:44,739 --> 03:39:46,040
I'm going to do poison.

3705
03:39:47,670 --> 03:39:49,170
They're entering the rift.

3706
03:39:49,670 --> 03:39:51,959
But I don't think we did it.

3707
03:39:51,959 --> 03:39:57,360
We lost who we two got in shit and they're coming through

3708
03:39:57,360 --> 03:39:57,760
this way.

3709
03:39:57,760 --> 03:39:59,360
We have no defense over here.

3710
03:40:02,219 --> 03:40:02,920
Well,

3711
03:40:12,399 --> 03:40:13,100
that hurts.

3712
03:40:29,860 --> 03:40:32,059
I don't like the noises my guy makes when he gets hurt.

3713
03:40:35,399 --> 03:40:37,799
Oh, also the trinkets to like teleport back to the end.

3714
03:40:37,799 --> 03:40:40,100
I think there's something we need someone needs to have that.

3715
03:40:40,200 --> 03:40:40,799
Yeah.

3716
03:40:47,120 --> 03:40:48,420
Somebody is getting in there.

3717
03:40:57,940 --> 03:40:58,440
Yeah, I don't know.

3718
03:40:58,540 --> 03:41:01,139
It looks like the maybe the strategy is to fall back a

3719
03:41:01,139 --> 03:41:01,840
little bit to the room.

3720
03:41:02,139 --> 03:41:03,840
That's the first we got without any problems.

3721
03:41:05,040 --> 03:41:06,540
I think we're still good.

3722
03:41:06,540 --> 03:41:08,639
I just wanted to put the fire at the beginning so that they

3723
03:41:08,639 --> 03:41:10,639
like take a lot of damage by the time they get here.

3724
03:41:10,739 --> 03:41:11,040
Yeah.

3725
03:41:13,040 --> 03:41:14,840
Okay, we need to come back to the room.

3726
03:41:18,860 --> 03:41:19,260
I'm dead.

3727
03:41:19,260 --> 03:41:19,659
Yeah.

3728
03:41:20,360 --> 03:41:21,059
I don't know where you were.

3729
03:41:21,159 --> 03:41:21,760
Yeah, it's over.

3730
03:41:22,559 --> 03:41:25,659
We only have half our remaining just restart.

3731
03:41:31,040 --> 03:41:31,840
In the game.

3732
03:41:34,750 --> 03:41:37,049
Shat you guys failed.

3733
03:41:37,049 --> 03:41:37,549
No, I don't.

3734
03:41:37,549 --> 03:41:38,750
I thought that was one of our characters though.

3735
03:41:38,750 --> 03:41:39,950
That was my character.

3736
03:41:41,360 --> 03:41:42,360
Let us do Gambo.

3737
03:41:43,579 --> 03:41:46,180
I think those are doubters that want to Gambo

3738
03:41:55,000 --> 03:41:57,200
an easy way to make all my points back.

3739
03:41:57,399 --> 03:42:00,559
Not long after it disappeared.

3740
03:42:01,059 --> 03:42:04,159
There were rumors that Master sickness banished him from

3741
03:42:04,159 --> 03:42:06,860
the order afraid of easiest win.

3742
03:42:06,860 --> 03:42:07,260
Yeah.

3743
03:42:07,260 --> 03:42:09,860
So what was the point of that story again?

3744
03:42:10,159 --> 03:42:12,659
The gigantic Orc army's genius.

3745
03:42:13,059 --> 03:42:15,260
They haven't been seen since the days of Masters.

3746
03:42:15,360 --> 03:42:19,659
I'm just I just thought about I just got it like a flash

3747
03:42:19,659 --> 03:42:24,159
in my brain of you with like a face cam and like and you

3748
03:42:24,159 --> 03:42:26,459
being like what the fuck I can't wait.

3749
03:42:28,159 --> 03:42:29,760
I can't gonna be so funny.

3750
03:42:29,860 --> 03:42:30,959
Let's trap it up.

3751
03:42:32,850 --> 03:42:33,850
What are you talking about?

3752
03:42:34,750 --> 03:42:36,649
Oh for five nights is for okay.

3753
03:42:37,149 --> 03:42:38,149
He does want to quit.

3754
03:42:38,350 --> 03:42:38,950
No, no, no.

3755
03:42:38,950 --> 03:42:40,649
I just like I just got like a huge.

3756
03:42:40,850 --> 03:42:41,149
I don't know.

3757
03:42:41,149 --> 03:42:46,250
I got like a YouTube video image of my brain of you sitting

3758
03:42:46,250 --> 03:42:49,350
there and the camera zooming in really close after the

3759
03:42:49,950 --> 03:42:52,950
after you get scared and being like what the hell where

3760
03:42:52,950 --> 03:42:55,049
did it even come from Reno like a zoom in quick?

3761
03:42:57,010 --> 03:43:00,290
Okay, this is going to be one of the most viewed videos

3762
03:43:00,290 --> 03:43:00,889
on your YouTube.

3763
03:43:01,860 --> 03:43:03,360
Is it is it really?

3764
03:43:03,360 --> 03:43:03,659
Yeah.

3765
03:43:04,370 --> 03:43:04,770
Okay.

3766
03:43:06,440 --> 03:43:08,940
You do you cut up like you have streams cut up right you

3767
03:43:08,940 --> 03:43:09,840
cut strings and put them up.

3768
03:43:09,840 --> 03:43:10,040
Yeah.

3769
03:43:10,340 --> 03:43:10,639
Yep.

3770
03:43:10,639 --> 03:43:10,940
Yep.

3771
03:43:10,940 --> 03:43:11,139
Yep.

3772
03:43:11,139 --> 03:43:14,940
Can I can I make my own little bit here your own back stir

3773
03:43:14,940 --> 03:43:18,440
place five nights at Freddy's 2 will have at least 10

3774
03:43:18,440 --> 03:43:21,940
to 20% more views than every video on that channel is

3775
03:43:21,940 --> 03:43:23,540
going to be my crowning achievement.

3776
03:43:23,639 --> 03:43:31,209
I think so at least 10% and if I win the bet you ready

3777
03:43:31,209 --> 03:43:35,139
up but I'm scared we haven't made any I haven't put

3778
03:43:35,139 --> 03:43:35,639
anything down.

3779
03:43:35,639 --> 03:43:36,940
I don't know what the strategy we're doing.

3780
03:43:40,059 --> 03:43:43,059
I think it wants us to do this so bad.

3781
03:43:43,059 --> 03:43:45,360
So I'm going to keep this is what we had before enemies

3782
03:43:45,360 --> 03:43:56,940
are preparing to breach one of our gates the door.

3783
03:44:01,680 --> 03:44:10,170
You're like I'm playing 40k same gameplay loop power

3784
03:44:10,170 --> 03:44:10,770
stored.

3785
03:44:11,370 --> 03:44:26,540
Nothing else mine launches them though.

3786
03:44:26,639 --> 03:44:27,840
So I have CC.

3787
03:44:51,450 --> 03:44:51,750
All right.

3788
03:44:51,750 --> 03:44:52,649
Now are we falling back?

3789
03:44:54,950 --> 03:44:55,649
We'll fight these guys.

3790
03:44:55,649 --> 03:44:57,350
He's the only guys on the map at the moment.

3791
03:45:04,260 --> 03:45:04,459
Okay.

3792
03:45:04,459 --> 03:45:05,360
Now there's more guys.

3793
03:45:05,360 --> 03:45:06,659
Okay, they're all coming this way.

3794
03:45:07,159 --> 03:45:07,760
We're good here.

3795
03:45:07,760 --> 03:45:08,459
We're good here.

3796
03:45:08,459 --> 03:45:10,360
Yeah, keep the communication good.

3797
03:45:10,360 --> 03:45:10,860
We're good.

3798
03:45:10,860 --> 03:45:11,559
We're good.

3799
03:45:13,659 --> 03:45:14,159
We're good.

3800
03:45:21,989 --> 03:45:22,489
They are old.

3801
03:45:22,489 --> 03:45:24,190
They are better one little barricade.

3802
03:45:24,190 --> 03:45:24,790
I put there.

3803
03:45:26,889 --> 03:45:27,489
I'm dead.

3804
03:45:28,469 --> 03:45:30,469
It's fine because you respond in the rift room, which is

3805
03:45:30,469 --> 03:45:31,270
actually helpful.

3806
03:45:31,969 --> 03:45:32,870
We need you.

3807
03:45:36,870 --> 03:45:37,670
I'm going to die too.

3808
03:45:45,819 --> 03:45:48,020
How they do deal a lot of damage now.

3809
03:45:48,120 --> 03:45:48,819
They do.

3810
03:45:52,809 --> 03:45:54,809
Oh, I may have put this on wrong and it's going to shoot

3811
03:45:54,809 --> 03:45:55,010
them.

3812
03:45:55,610 --> 03:45:57,409
Yeah, I did the same thing downstairs.

3813
03:45:58,879 --> 03:46:11,000
No, I wonder if upgrading the heels a good idea.

3814
03:46:11,000 --> 03:46:13,000
I wonder what it does because it's healing us like full

3815
03:46:13,000 --> 03:46:13,299
health.

3816
03:46:14,879 --> 03:46:16,180
What would an upgraded heal do?

3817
03:46:16,680 --> 03:46:23,940
If it's like a buff, maybe make you even more healed shorter

3818
03:46:23,940 --> 03:46:24,540
cooldown.

3819
03:46:29,260 --> 03:46:30,860
I can't believe only one got in there.

3820
03:46:43,739 --> 03:46:44,639
I wish I could spin this.

3821
03:46:46,239 --> 03:46:48,540
All right, that we got we got the bomb.

3822
03:46:49,239 --> 03:46:53,280
Hope all things those will go straight for barricades.

3823
03:46:53,680 --> 03:46:56,479
So they're fast and they have bombs on their backs.

3824
03:47:11,819 --> 03:47:12,819
Dude, I've been counting.

3825
03:47:12,819 --> 03:47:14,020
You've done three.

3826
03:47:14,020 --> 03:47:15,719
You've done 300 lip lights.

3827
03:47:16,790 --> 03:47:17,290
Jump up.

3828
03:47:17,790 --> 03:47:19,489
They they're getting in.

3829
03:47:23,440 --> 03:47:25,940
I think I think Defender Rift Room was the strat.

3830
03:47:25,940 --> 03:47:26,440
I think it is.

3831
03:47:27,040 --> 03:47:34,690
Enemies at the Rift too much going on on this map.

3832
03:47:38,479 --> 03:47:40,780
Hey, we could be cowards and turn it back down.

3833
03:47:43,000 --> 03:47:44,200
Are you a little baby?

3834
03:47:45,299 --> 03:47:46,600
Are you like a little child?

3835
03:47:54,059 --> 03:47:55,659
Well, it's technically not over yet.

3836
03:47:55,760 --> 03:47:58,260
Oh, what's remaining?

3837
03:48:11,799 --> 03:48:12,899
Oh, this guy's getting in.

3838
03:48:18,250 --> 03:48:19,450
No, they're not.

3839
03:48:21,709 --> 03:48:25,309
It's always just one small elemental just goes right by

3840
03:48:27,879 --> 03:48:31,180
reset, reset, reset, reset.

3841
03:48:31,180 --> 03:48:31,979
We got it this time.

3842
03:48:31,979 --> 03:48:34,180
Defend the Rift Room easy.

3843
03:48:34,379 --> 03:48:36,180
But we're we almost got it.

3844
03:48:36,680 --> 03:48:37,879
No, we no trust.

3845
03:48:38,680 --> 03:48:41,180
We got this next one believers.

3846
03:48:42,059 --> 03:48:43,860
Believers all in believers.

3847
03:48:44,639 --> 03:48:48,440
Oh, are you sure about that?

3848
03:48:49,540 --> 03:48:50,239
I'm positive.

3849
03:48:53,059 --> 03:48:54,159
I know what needs to be done.

3850
03:48:56,860 --> 03:48:57,360
Okay.

3851
03:48:57,760 --> 03:48:58,360
Are you sure?

3852
03:48:59,680 --> 03:49:00,479
I'm positive.

3853
03:49:02,760 --> 03:49:05,260
All right, positive.

3854
03:49:05,260 --> 03:49:07,360
I'm gonna take like the barricade off my bar.

3855
03:49:08,690 --> 03:49:17,139
No barricades just damage and we're only being Rift Room Andes.

3856
03:49:17,239 --> 03:49:21,940
I think barricades only at the end so we can defend them.

3857
03:49:24,040 --> 03:49:25,340
Rift Room Andes.

3858
03:49:27,139 --> 03:49:31,639
So do you want to just pick a side and I'll fortify one you fortify the other and then we'll eventually come into the middle.

3859
03:49:31,639 --> 03:49:32,840
There's three sides.

3860
03:49:33,239 --> 03:49:35,739
Yeah, but this they don't start coming.

3861
03:49:36,440 --> 03:49:37,840
They don't start coming down here till later.

3862
03:49:38,639 --> 03:49:40,040
It's the left and right rooms first.

3863
03:49:41,239 --> 03:49:44,840
Together to create armies not seen you taking the left side.

3864
03:49:45,920 --> 03:49:49,120
Okay, I will fortify this right side.

3865
03:49:49,889 --> 03:49:50,290
This time.

3866
03:49:50,290 --> 03:49:51,389
I'm not going to mess this up.

3867
03:50:00,899 --> 03:50:01,399
I'm ready.

3868
03:50:07,600 --> 03:50:08,600
I'm doubting this time.

3869
03:50:08,600 --> 03:50:09,299
Oh shit.

3870
03:50:09,399 --> 03:50:11,200
Okay, there's a lot of doubters.

3871
03:50:11,299 --> 03:50:12,700
I'm going to what's the ratio here?

3872
03:50:14,719 --> 03:50:15,920
Actually, no, it's pretty even.

3873
03:50:15,920 --> 03:50:16,319
Never mind.

3874
03:50:19,340 --> 03:50:20,540
Fine is believers.

3875
03:50:20,540 --> 03:50:23,139
They want people believing in your chat.

3876
03:50:23,540 --> 03:50:35,899
Yeah, honest to goodness.

3877
03:50:35,899 --> 03:50:37,299
Let's game one of our games.

3878
03:50:37,799 --> 03:50:55,840
The door is I just hear you're dead.

3879
03:50:55,840 --> 03:50:57,440
Do you lose money if you die?

3880
03:50:57,739 --> 03:50:58,440
I don't know.

3881
03:50:59,040 --> 03:51:00,139
I kind of did die on.

3882
03:51:00,340 --> 03:51:01,739
Oh, no, the believers.

3883
03:51:04,059 --> 03:51:04,459
I want it.

3884
03:51:04,459 --> 03:51:05,559
I wanted to come back quick.

3885
03:51:29,620 --> 03:51:33,620
This map has me paranoid paranoid.

3886
03:51:41,989 --> 03:51:44,489
So is there only one level in this game or what streamer?

3887
03:51:45,489 --> 03:51:50,690
I mean, I've only seen I've been watching for a while and I've

3888
03:51:50,690 --> 03:51:51,989
only seen this one level.

3889
03:51:53,899 --> 03:51:54,799
Oh, right.

3890
03:52:05,899 --> 03:52:07,000
What there are.

3891
03:52:09,629 --> 03:52:11,829
Okay, they're coming down the middle down.

3892
03:52:15,649 --> 03:52:18,350
I turn around to deal with your fucking problem.

3893
03:52:20,549 --> 03:52:23,049
I don't need to defend the middle.

3894
03:52:24,350 --> 03:52:25,549
Walks down the middle.

3895
03:52:26,549 --> 03:52:33,430
I don't know what you said, but it was you scared me.

3896
03:52:40,520 --> 03:52:41,319
It was a rap.

3897
03:52:55,920 --> 03:52:56,219
Bro.

3898
03:52:56,219 --> 03:52:56,719
What?

3899
03:52:57,219 --> 03:52:58,020
I don't know what to do.

3900
03:52:58,899 --> 03:52:59,600
Come up the middle.

3901
03:53:07,600 --> 03:53:07,799
All right.

3902
03:53:07,799 --> 03:53:09,600
Now we focus a little bit of building in the mid.

3903
03:53:30,659 --> 03:53:34,860
I think there's some element of like dealing the correct damage

3904
03:53:34,860 --> 03:53:36,559
types to certain enemies were missing.

3905
03:53:36,559 --> 03:53:38,860
Yes, that is a good point.

3906
03:53:40,530 --> 03:53:43,530
I think if you're on hard, you need to do that 100%.

3907
03:53:46,860 --> 03:53:47,760
All right, still the middle.

3908
03:53:49,180 --> 03:53:50,280
They're coming from your way.

3909
03:53:52,180 --> 03:53:53,879
I'll handle this in here.

3910
03:54:00,969 --> 03:54:03,969
There's a lot and I'm getting hurt.

3911
03:54:04,069 --> 03:54:05,069
This big guy over here.

3912
03:54:05,870 --> 03:54:06,870
There's a lot in the room.

3913
03:54:06,870 --> 03:54:09,170
I'm having some trouble.

3914
03:54:09,870 --> 03:54:10,469
He got me.

3915
03:54:10,870 --> 03:54:11,670
He outplayed me.

3916
03:54:15,270 --> 03:54:31,649
Okay, not another one's getting through.

3917
03:54:35,440 --> 03:54:36,040
You sure?

3918
03:54:36,540 --> 03:54:37,040
I'm sure.

3919
03:54:52,850 --> 03:54:53,049
All right.

3920
03:54:53,049 --> 03:54:54,549
We have a second here after this.

3921
03:54:55,149 --> 03:54:59,610
We have one second enemies in my rift room more likely than

3922
03:54:59,610 --> 03:55:00,909
the same three PC check.

3923
03:55:00,909 --> 03:55:03,610
What why would I just got so distracted by that?

3924
03:55:03,709 --> 03:55:04,610
Yeah, you'd let one in.

3925
03:55:05,010 --> 03:55:07,610
I said no more and you went in that the mods post something

3926
03:55:07,610 --> 03:55:08,110
funny.

3927
03:55:11,579 --> 03:55:13,280
Okay, I see how it is.

3928
03:55:14,079 --> 03:55:16,079
We just we just let them into our rift now.

3929
03:55:18,659 --> 03:55:19,860
Okay, watch out for these bombers.

3930
03:55:20,899 --> 03:55:22,799
Oh this they walk over this fire trap.

3931
03:55:22,799 --> 03:55:24,600
They just blow up really.

3932
03:55:27,500 --> 03:55:28,899
Okay, don't let them blow up on you.

3933
03:55:31,930 --> 03:55:33,530
But yeah, they insta died on the fire.

3934
03:55:34,209 --> 03:55:40,100
Maybe we just put those out in front of all every door that

3935
03:55:40,100 --> 03:55:40,799
makes them.

3936
03:55:44,700 --> 03:55:45,299
Watch out enemies.

3937
03:55:46,899 --> 03:55:49,399
I'm so tired and old from saying this.

3938
03:55:56,129 --> 03:55:59,329
Kind of sounds like the principal from Beavis and Butthead.

3939
03:56:00,329 --> 03:56:00,829
It does.

3940
03:56:01,430 --> 03:56:02,829
Oh, Beavis and Butthead.

3941
03:56:04,129 --> 03:56:05,530
You're both expelled.

3942
03:56:07,639 --> 03:56:09,040
Every episode expelled.

3943
03:56:10,040 --> 03:56:13,139
They get expelled like every year every episode.

3944
03:56:25,799 --> 03:56:30,000
I love the old the old man voice is such a classic.

3945
03:56:31,719 --> 03:56:32,520
Everybody's got one.

3946
03:56:33,620 --> 03:56:35,120
And it varies right?

3947
03:56:35,620 --> 03:56:37,920
What is your old man voice?

3948
03:56:38,420 --> 03:56:39,420
That's Deckard Kane.

3949
03:56:39,819 --> 03:56:40,219
Yep.

3950
03:56:41,020 --> 03:56:46,579
There is I'm an old man like I do that one sometimes.

3951
03:56:47,180 --> 03:56:50,979
It's also the one with a little more a little more in the

3952
03:56:50,979 --> 03:56:52,479
side of his road area.

3953
03:56:53,079 --> 03:56:55,180
Are you going to talk like that when you're an old man?

3954
03:56:55,680 --> 03:57:00,020
I honestly probably I feel like I talk like that now sometimes

3955
03:57:00,020 --> 03:57:00,420
honestly.

3956
03:57:01,850 --> 03:57:02,850
They're almost in the rift room.

3957
03:57:07,690 --> 03:57:09,690
It is like this.

3958
03:57:09,690 --> 03:57:11,590
It's more air.

3959
03:57:12,090 --> 03:57:15,090
There's air lots of air in this one.

3960
03:57:16,090 --> 03:57:19,190
Yes, you can combine them even if you want to.

3961
03:57:20,090 --> 03:57:23,389
The one that's more in the throat can also be used with

3962
03:57:23,389 --> 03:57:25,090
the one that's more airy.

3963
03:57:25,090 --> 03:57:25,889
Oh my God.

3964
03:57:26,790 --> 03:57:29,590
I am focused on this.

3965
03:57:31,209 --> 03:57:31,909
I'm sorry.

3966
03:57:32,110 --> 03:57:34,010
I'm sorry about the bit the bit.

3967
03:57:34,110 --> 03:57:35,309
Enemies at the rift.

3968
03:57:35,709 --> 03:57:36,909
I'm not focused on the bit.

3969
03:57:37,309 --> 03:57:38,409
We're going to lose.

3970
03:57:39,110 --> 03:57:39,809
I know.

3971
03:57:46,809 --> 03:57:49,709
I know doubters salivating right now.

3972
03:57:50,959 --> 03:57:52,159
We were going to win.

3973
03:57:52,659 --> 03:57:55,459
We were not going to and then there was a there was a bit.

3974
03:57:55,860 --> 03:57:57,559
I didn't know there was going to be a bit.

3975
03:57:57,760 --> 03:57:58,860
There was no bit.

3976
03:57:58,860 --> 03:58:02,059
We were dead from the last five minutes.

3977
03:58:02,059 --> 03:58:02,860
We were done.

3978
03:58:05,170 --> 03:58:06,270
I leaned in and went.

3979
03:58:06,270 --> 03:58:12,170
Oh, well, well, well, well this trinket equipping increases

3980
03:58:12,170 --> 03:58:16,069
rift points makes enemy was worth zero rift points for a

3981
03:58:16,069 --> 03:58:19,510
short time if used you can just stand next to the rift when

3982
03:58:19,510 --> 03:58:21,010
you see those guys like oh, there's a whole bunch.

3983
03:58:21,010 --> 03:58:23,510
Just just cast your your empty rift.

3984
03:58:23,909 --> 03:58:27,690
What that's insane.

3985
03:58:27,790 --> 03:58:34,940
We're missing a whole thing here and then there's the ring

3986
03:58:34,940 --> 03:58:36,639
of storms which defends the rift.

3987
03:58:38,540 --> 03:58:40,440
I'm refunding all my upgrades.

3988
03:58:40,739 --> 03:58:50,629
I am purchasing the ring of storms and I'm going to use it.

3989
03:58:55,819 --> 03:58:57,219
I don't know how you feel about that.

3990
03:59:00,020 --> 03:59:04,389
I think now what are some of those those one very important

3991
03:59:04,389 --> 03:59:04,889
question.

3992
03:59:05,590 --> 03:59:08,489
Is there a kind of list of enemies we can look at like a

3993
03:59:09,690 --> 03:59:14,489
it's like a tome or something we can open that shows enemies

3994
03:59:14,489 --> 03:59:19,579
and how what their damage types are and everything because

3995
03:59:19,579 --> 03:59:22,680
we need to find out what is hurting the elementals where

3996
03:59:22,680 --> 03:59:33,040
they are the earth ones the most I don't see it anywhere get

3997
03:59:33,040 --> 03:59:34,440
jar of ghosts a hundred percent.

3998
03:59:35,989 --> 03:59:36,590
Yeah, we need this.

3999
03:59:36,690 --> 03:59:42,379
We got a got to be any strategy here cause the enemies that

4000
03:59:42,379 --> 03:59:45,079
hit the player to run away enemies turn and run away.

4001
03:59:46,280 --> 03:59:51,280
So it's like a here arcane and lightning is what you want.

4002
03:59:51,680 --> 03:59:53,280
So maybe I'll get the arcane staff.

4003
03:59:54,479 --> 03:59:56,979
Yeah, we had nothing that was arcane long-range.

4004
03:59:56,979 --> 03:59:59,879
I have brimstone floor deals arcane damage.

4005
04:00:00,979 --> 04:00:02,579
I didn't even know there was an arcane.

4006
04:00:03,079 --> 04:00:06,760
I'll I'll get the arcane staff staff real good.

4007
04:00:12,719 --> 04:00:15,219
So I need to hurt things with this.

4008
04:00:15,520 --> 04:00:16,620
So I got that upgraded.

4009
04:00:17,719 --> 04:00:23,760
I will use that as a weapon and then what about the grinder?

4010
04:00:24,729 --> 04:00:26,829
I just got the grinder.

4011
04:00:27,030 --> 04:00:30,430
Okay, and you can hit me off on grinder if you want.

4012
04:00:30,629 --> 04:00:35,329
All right, but priestess the priestess is arcane.

4013
04:00:37,790 --> 04:00:38,290
Okay.

4014
04:00:38,889 --> 04:00:47,559
Okay, you want us to be arcane just do a ton of arcane damage

4015
04:00:47,559 --> 04:00:48,360
with these priestesses.

4016
04:00:50,340 --> 04:00:52,840
On priestess it says war scenario only.

4017
04:00:52,840 --> 04:00:53,540
Oh shit.

4018
04:00:53,540 --> 04:00:55,040
Okay, there's a few of those.

4019
04:00:55,040 --> 04:01:00,559
I wanted to get those before tornado in a box war scenario

4020
04:01:00,559 --> 04:01:02,659
only maybe we should can you toggle something to make

4021
04:01:02,659 --> 04:01:04,260
so you don't get to see them?

4022
04:01:06,670 --> 04:01:07,670
I think push trap.

4023
04:01:07,670 --> 04:01:09,670
We need some we need some pushing.

4024
04:01:10,170 --> 04:01:13,170
Oh snow cannon short-range cannon that freezes and damages

4025
04:01:13,170 --> 04:01:13,670
enemies.

4026
04:01:14,959 --> 04:01:15,860
This looks like it's on the ceiling.

4027
04:01:15,860 --> 04:01:16,559
Is there ceiling?

4028
04:01:19,829 --> 04:01:22,229
I hope this is ceiling in in the rift room.

4029
04:01:22,229 --> 04:01:24,530
No, but like there's only ceilings downstairs.

4030
04:01:25,530 --> 04:01:28,760
All right, I'm gonna I'm gonna get it.

4031
04:01:28,760 --> 04:01:29,360
I'm curious.

4032
04:01:29,360 --> 04:01:39,610
I'm gonna try it wind belt short-ranged AOE crowd control

4033
04:01:39,610 --> 04:01:41,209
that pushes enemies secondary commute.

4034
04:01:41,209 --> 04:01:44,110
So this is a I think this is rooting.

4035
04:01:44,309 --> 04:01:48,190
Is this like a weapon get jar of ghosts get jar of ghosts,

4036
04:01:48,190 --> 04:01:48,489
please.

4037
04:01:51,120 --> 04:01:51,319
All right.

4038
04:01:51,319 --> 04:02:01,879
I'll get jar of those everyone saying to get it increase

4039
04:02:01,879 --> 04:02:03,379
passive fear duration.

4040
04:02:05,719 --> 04:02:11,280
Okay, and then I got enough to do like one more or two

4041
04:02:11,280 --> 04:02:15,479
more things window of butterflies.

4042
04:02:17,489 --> 04:02:23,159
Stracting enemy deep freeze.

4043
04:02:23,159 --> 04:02:27,110
I'm ready kind of want this but it's not on the ground when

4044
04:02:27,110 --> 04:02:28,709
I need something on the ground ceiling lasers.

4045
04:02:28,709 --> 04:02:43,120
No, I am so like what do you have to make sure I can I've

4046
04:02:43,120 --> 04:02:44,420
got grinders.

4047
04:02:44,420 --> 04:02:46,319
I've got archer ladies.

4048
04:02:46,620 --> 04:02:48,420
I think I'm going to upgrade the spike wall the big one

4049
04:02:48,420 --> 04:02:49,520
that like pushes him back.

4050
04:02:51,100 --> 04:02:51,700
Yeah.

4051
04:02:52,000 --> 04:02:53,100
Yeah, that makes sense.

4052
04:02:53,500 --> 04:02:54,500
We need some push backs.

4053
04:02:54,500 --> 04:02:57,399
I upgraded my the floor fire all the way.

4054
04:02:58,860 --> 04:03:00,959
That seemed good against the Bombers.

4055
04:03:01,659 --> 04:03:02,059
Yep.

4056
04:03:02,559 --> 04:03:03,760
And then maybe I'll do tar.

4057
04:03:05,760 --> 04:03:07,059
Yeah, yeah, I got Targon.

4058
04:03:08,329 --> 04:03:11,430
Enemies remain slowed for a brief time or they take more

4059
04:03:11,430 --> 04:03:12,030
fire damage.

4060
04:03:14,600 --> 04:03:15,899
So there's a after they walk on it.

4061
04:03:15,899 --> 04:03:20,479
They're still slow or enemies take increased fire damage

4062
04:03:20,479 --> 04:03:25,239
on tar just keep the slow.

4063
04:03:25,239 --> 04:03:26,040
Maybe I don't know.

4064
04:03:26,139 --> 04:03:26,739
I don't know man.

4065
04:03:26,739 --> 04:03:27,239
I don't know dude.

4066
04:03:27,239 --> 04:03:27,639
All right.

4067
04:03:28,139 --> 04:03:29,840
Well, I got we got we got some shit here.

4068
04:03:30,139 --> 04:03:30,840
Let's give it a try.

4069
04:03:38,239 --> 04:03:40,340
I'm about to just like, you know what I mean?

4070
04:03:41,969 --> 04:03:43,969
We need to not long after that battle.

4071
04:03:44,270 --> 04:03:45,569
We need to redo this whole thing.

4072
04:03:46,069 --> 04:03:49,270
There were rumors that master sickness banished him from

4073
04:03:49,270 --> 04:03:51,270
the order afraid of what he might.

4074
04:03:51,270 --> 04:03:54,870
So so what was the point of that story again?

4075
04:03:55,170 --> 04:03:57,670
The gigantic orc army's genius.

4076
04:03:58,069 --> 04:04:00,670
They haven't been seen since the days of master sickness

4077
04:04:00,670 --> 04:04:03,069
and boric and now they're back.

4078
04:04:04,069 --> 04:04:06,270
Putting the fire traps on these corners.

4079
04:04:06,569 --> 04:04:09,370
So when the runner boys come out, they'll probably just

4080
04:04:09,670 --> 04:04:09,969
die.

4081
04:04:11,469 --> 04:04:12,670
All my shit is expensive.

4082
04:04:13,170 --> 04:04:14,670
You've got this sorceress.

4083
04:04:14,969 --> 04:04:15,969
Let's trap it up.

4084
04:04:22,379 --> 04:04:23,479
Let's trap it up.

4085
04:04:23,979 --> 04:04:24,780
Yeah, she did.

4086
04:04:33,489 --> 04:04:33,690
All right.

4087
04:04:33,690 --> 04:04:34,889
Let me take a look how this all works.

4088
04:04:35,860 --> 04:04:36,159
Okay.

4089
04:04:39,260 --> 04:04:39,360
Okay.

4090
04:04:39,360 --> 04:04:40,360
So that's like of AOE.

4091
04:04:42,680 --> 04:04:43,180
Let me see.

4092
04:04:43,180 --> 04:04:45,280
So this has to go on a ceiling.

4093
04:04:45,280 --> 04:04:47,579
Oh push traps are really cheap.

4094
04:04:50,290 --> 04:04:51,790
Are we doing rift room?

4095
04:04:55,059 --> 04:04:55,459
Yeah.

4096
04:04:55,860 --> 04:04:56,159
Okay.

4097
04:05:02,530 --> 04:05:04,930
I wonder how much range these have because I could probably

4098
04:05:04,930 --> 04:05:06,030
aim them into the room.

4099
04:05:12,489 --> 04:05:14,389
Okay, so they're gonna and they're gonna come this way.

4100
04:05:20,739 --> 04:05:21,139
All right.

4101
04:05:21,139 --> 04:05:23,540
I got this is gonna be disgusting.

4102
04:05:24,309 --> 04:05:24,610
Okay.

4103
04:05:24,610 --> 04:05:26,909
Yeah, and I have this turns the rift into like a lightning

4104
04:05:26,909 --> 04:05:29,709
storm for one like shit's all getting close to it.

4105
04:05:29,709 --> 04:05:31,510
We're we're we're winning this one.

4106
04:05:32,120 --> 04:05:33,420
We like bought things.

4107
04:05:33,420 --> 04:05:34,120
You know what I mean?

4108
04:05:36,040 --> 04:05:36,639
I think we're good.

4109
04:05:39,290 --> 04:05:39,889
Let's give it a try.

4110
04:05:41,870 --> 04:05:42,870
I got snow.

4111
04:05:42,870 --> 04:05:46,670
I got free expensive snow cannons right here aiming right

4112
04:05:46,670 --> 04:05:56,329
and then probably gonna be like there.

4113
04:05:56,329 --> 04:05:56,829
There they are.

4114
04:05:57,950 --> 04:05:59,690
Yeah, I think that's a good spot.

4115
04:06:01,379 --> 04:06:04,079
I want so that I can activate this but it's a passive but

4116
04:06:04,079 --> 04:06:04,879
I can also activate it.

4117
04:06:04,879 --> 04:06:06,280
And I think it's just a big fear.

4118
04:06:07,309 --> 04:06:07,709
I wonder.

4119
04:06:07,909 --> 04:06:08,209
Okay.

4120
04:06:12,250 --> 04:06:13,549
Oh fun.

4121
04:06:14,049 --> 04:06:25,079
Oh enemies are preparing to breach one of our gates.

4122
04:06:25,680 --> 04:06:27,180
They've broken through a gate.

4123
04:06:30,370 --> 04:06:32,069
This is like very bright.

4124
04:06:32,770 --> 04:06:34,770
Yeah, I just have like more damage on the sword and

4125
04:06:34,770 --> 04:06:35,270
everything.

4126
04:07:01,229 --> 04:07:12,739
All right, pull back someone the other way.

4127
04:07:15,399 --> 04:07:17,600
I have no cannons over there.

4128
04:07:19,450 --> 04:07:21,549
Hey, I'm back at the roof room to make sure.

4129
04:07:22,350 --> 04:07:26,270
Okay, so are you really like the corner archer?

4130
04:07:27,270 --> 04:07:28,170
No snow cannons.

4131
04:07:28,569 --> 04:07:32,170
No snow cannons fucked him up by the way only like three

4132
04:07:32,170 --> 04:07:32,670
people here.

4133
04:07:34,819 --> 04:07:36,219
I'm going to load even more.

4134
04:07:36,219 --> 04:07:38,719
I'm going to make this like this is just only snow cannons

4135
04:07:38,719 --> 04:07:39,120
over here.

4136
04:07:43,010 --> 04:07:44,010
Good luck getting through that.

4137
04:07:48,340 --> 04:07:49,040
Oh, that's a fast.

4138
04:07:51,319 --> 04:07:52,319
Reached again.

4139
04:07:52,620 --> 04:07:54,520
Okay, watch out.

4140
04:08:07,159 --> 04:08:08,159
Okay, we got to get back.

4141
04:08:13,469 --> 04:08:14,770
They're almost there.

4142
04:08:18,770 --> 04:08:19,370
They're in the room.

4143
04:08:41,370 --> 04:08:42,569
Dude, what the fuck?

4144
04:08:42,670 --> 04:08:45,899
You want to fire guys little firemen?

4145
04:08:45,899 --> 04:08:46,399
Okay.

4146
04:08:49,129 --> 04:08:49,629
Okay.

4147
04:08:51,040 --> 04:09:00,510
That was I guess if they want to do that, that's cute.

4148
04:09:00,510 --> 04:09:01,209
They can do that.

4149
04:09:04,239 --> 04:09:05,239
Everybody gets one.

4150
04:09:05,340 --> 04:09:06,739
What's that right there?

4151
04:09:06,739 --> 04:09:07,239
Yeah, you got it.

4152
04:09:09,920 --> 04:09:25,549
People in people in I died.

4153
04:09:27,549 --> 04:09:33,680
Okay, I turned on the lightning rift.

4154
04:09:33,680 --> 04:09:35,680
I don't I barely saw it do anything.

4155
04:09:50,780 --> 04:09:51,379
We're okay.

4156
04:10:14,420 --> 04:10:16,219
Little sketchy so far could have been way worse.

4157
04:10:22,530 --> 04:10:29,180
You're I can do that eat shit.

4158
04:10:29,180 --> 04:10:30,280
No one fucking getting through here.

4159
04:10:43,030 --> 04:10:43,829
I think I'm through the middle.

4160
04:10:52,889 --> 04:10:54,290
We have multiple elementals.

4161
04:11:03,270 --> 04:11:04,469
Oh left side.

4162
04:11:05,170 --> 04:11:07,670
Oh fuck by little fires little fires little fires.

4163
04:11:14,409 --> 04:11:16,209
We need some barricades up here.

4164
04:11:18,530 --> 04:11:20,430
Anything so they don't just like walking.

4165
04:11:23,200 --> 04:11:24,700
All right, let's let's regroup a little.

4166
04:11:30,069 --> 04:11:30,969
Oh, I see what's happening.

4167
04:11:30,969 --> 04:11:32,370
I need to sell that shit.

4168
04:11:51,000 --> 04:11:52,600
Why does it feel like the worst we've done?

4169
04:11:54,700 --> 04:11:58,299
It definitely isn't but it's it's up there.

4170
04:11:58,399 --> 04:11:59,100
We still have seven.

4171
04:12:01,479 --> 04:12:02,379
All right, this waves almost done.

4172
04:12:02,379 --> 04:12:05,180
We got to we got to rethink the strategy here in a sec.

4173
04:12:07,049 --> 04:12:11,149
Oh, I got to sell this thing is when does the wave in like

4174
04:12:11,149 --> 04:12:12,950
when they're all dead you get a moment to sell when they're

4175
04:12:12,950 --> 04:12:13,250
all dead.

4176
04:12:13,250 --> 04:12:13,549
Yeah.

4177
04:12:15,500 --> 04:12:16,000
What are you guys?

4178
04:12:16,100 --> 04:12:17,000
Who's who's spamming this?

4179
04:12:37,129 --> 04:12:37,530
Okay.

4180
04:12:37,530 --> 04:12:37,829
Okay.

4181
04:12:37,829 --> 04:12:38,030
Okay.

4182
04:12:38,030 --> 04:12:38,530
Okay.

4183
04:12:39,030 --> 04:12:41,899
I wish I had one second.

4184
04:12:43,040 --> 04:12:46,239
Yeah, I really I'm if I could sell one thing it would help

4185
04:12:46,239 --> 04:12:46,840
so much.

4186
04:12:59,540 --> 04:13:04,120
Are yeah, I know I know once we get one second here.

4187
04:13:04,120 --> 04:13:07,079
We'll be all right at this the opportunity.

4188
04:13:10,620 --> 04:13:10,920
Okay.

4189
04:13:19,510 --> 04:13:21,010
I'm going to put some tar in the middle.

4190
04:13:28,209 --> 04:13:30,010
Yeah, all the bombers are just blowing up.

4191
04:13:31,620 --> 04:13:32,520
Yeah, they all died.

4192
04:13:32,520 --> 04:13:34,420
I even have to look at them so we can actually set up

4193
04:13:34,420 --> 04:13:35,219
barricades in here.

4194
04:13:35,319 --> 04:13:36,219
Do you have barricades?

4195
04:13:37,120 --> 04:13:39,920
I don't on my bar, but I do.

4196
04:13:41,219 --> 04:13:42,319
I'm going to focus on that then.

4197
04:13:42,520 --> 04:13:49,159
Okay, which way to go that way.

4198
04:13:51,440 --> 04:13:52,639
I think they're coming up the other side.

4199
04:13:52,840 --> 04:13:53,639
I'll take it this side.

4200
04:13:53,639 --> 04:13:54,340
You go to the other side.

4201
04:14:12,549 --> 04:14:12,950
Okay.

4202
04:14:14,180 --> 04:14:14,680
Okay.

4203
04:14:29,340 --> 04:14:30,840
I got to get a snow can up here.

4204
04:14:31,610 --> 04:14:32,610
That would be nice.

4205
04:14:32,610 --> 04:14:34,010
There's not a lot of feelings up here.

4206
04:14:35,340 --> 04:14:43,280
There's a lot of people coming in behind us too.

4207
04:14:43,479 --> 04:14:45,180
Yeah, we're done.

4208
04:14:46,479 --> 04:14:46,879
Nope.

4209
04:14:54,040 --> 04:14:54,540
Nope.

4210
04:14:57,920 --> 04:14:58,719
Good freeze.

4211
04:14:58,719 --> 04:14:59,520
Good freeze.

4212
04:15:05,239 --> 04:15:07,940
And I have whatever I still am not a hundred percent sure.

4213
04:15:07,940 --> 04:15:10,639
I activate like super long cooldown for the rift.

4214
04:15:21,389 --> 04:15:22,489
It's only these two sides right now.

4215
04:15:22,489 --> 04:15:23,290
I think we're okay.

4216
04:15:23,790 --> 04:15:23,989
All right.

4217
04:15:23,989 --> 04:15:25,790
I got a snow cannon going up in a second.

4218
04:15:37,659 --> 04:15:38,959
We can do it.

4219
04:15:40,829 --> 04:15:42,729
This is actually the best we've done.

4220
04:15:43,700 --> 04:15:44,600
We're actually doing all right.

4221
04:15:44,600 --> 04:15:47,500
Yeah, I think that we're not worried about these barricades

4222
04:15:47,500 --> 04:15:48,100
getting destroyed.

4223
04:15:48,100 --> 04:15:49,700
It's only going to get a little easier.

4224
04:15:57,590 --> 04:15:59,190
Okay, I got a bunch of snow over there.

4225
04:15:59,989 --> 04:16:10,520
All right, they're coming all the I think yeah, this is okay.

4226
04:16:10,520 --> 04:16:12,120
I got remember the snow cannons down here.

4227
04:16:13,120 --> 04:16:13,819
Doing work.

4228
04:16:20,549 --> 04:16:21,950
So much damage.

4229
04:16:21,950 --> 04:16:22,450
Holy shit.

4230
04:16:22,450 --> 04:16:23,350
This word is good.

4231
04:16:23,850 --> 04:16:33,159
Finally.

4232
04:16:34,360 --> 04:16:35,159
Why are they not shooting?

4233
04:16:35,659 --> 04:16:36,159
Oh, okay.

4234
04:16:36,159 --> 04:16:37,059
I was gonna say what's going on?

4235
04:16:48,889 --> 04:16:49,790
Still only this way.

4236
04:16:49,790 --> 04:16:50,290
So we're good.

4237
04:16:53,850 --> 04:16:56,850
Could we was betting allowed here because I think we're this

4238
04:16:56,850 --> 04:16:57,950
is this looks like it.

4239
04:16:57,950 --> 04:16:58,549
This is the one.

4240
04:17:08,180 --> 04:17:09,379
Yeah, I'm freezing them too.

4241
04:17:24,120 --> 04:17:26,020
That's the only way five of eight still.

4242
04:17:38,899 --> 04:17:40,100
I need more mana.

4243
04:17:48,459 --> 04:17:49,260
That's fear actually.

4244
04:17:49,260 --> 04:17:49,860
Thank God.

4245
04:17:50,159 --> 04:17:52,659
Oh, I'm dying.

4246
04:17:52,860 --> 04:17:53,659
I just died too.

4247
04:17:58,229 --> 04:17:58,629
All right.

4248
04:17:58,629 --> 04:17:59,030
All right.

4249
04:18:00,110 --> 04:18:02,209
I don't know who here destroyed my barricade.

4250
04:18:02,209 --> 04:18:03,909
Something blew up and let's write everything.

4251
04:18:06,459 --> 04:18:06,860
All right.

4252
04:18:06,860 --> 04:18:07,360
Where we going?

4253
04:18:07,860 --> 04:18:12,750
There's plenty over here, but let me go like this.

4254
04:18:25,909 --> 04:18:27,209
All right, we're looking where we're looking.

4255
04:18:27,209 --> 04:18:28,010
We're looking where we're looking.

4256
04:18:29,309 --> 04:18:31,610
Middle where middle and I'm going to go middle.

4257
04:18:32,510 --> 04:18:34,409
You say I'm on the side where we were.

4258
04:18:34,709 --> 04:18:35,610
I'm good over here.

4259
04:18:37,889 --> 04:18:39,389
I think I know this troll.

4260
04:18:43,329 --> 04:18:45,489
I got you good.

4261
04:18:47,200 --> 04:18:47,399
All right.

4262
04:18:47,399 --> 04:18:48,100
They're coming on the right side.

4263
04:18:48,100 --> 04:18:52,690
No, you're in here.

4264
04:18:55,579 --> 04:18:56,180
Tom's comp.

4265
04:18:57,180 --> 04:18:57,879
I'm coming.

4266
04:18:57,879 --> 04:18:58,780
Watch out for little fireman.

4267
04:18:59,479 --> 04:18:59,979
Fireman.

4268
04:19:13,139 --> 04:19:16,440
We guys look at damn morning.

4269
04:19:16,440 --> 04:19:16,739
I did.

4270
04:19:23,020 --> 04:19:24,319
They got the barricade over here.

4271
04:19:35,000 --> 04:19:35,299
I don't know.

4272
04:19:35,299 --> 04:19:37,399
What's causing that barricade to constantly blow up?

4273
04:19:37,799 --> 04:19:38,899
I think they just run it up here.

4274
04:19:41,899 --> 04:19:43,000
Oh, there's so many.

4275
04:19:50,479 --> 04:19:51,780
No, we were doing so good.

4276
04:19:51,780 --> 04:19:52,379
So many.

4277
04:19:52,379 --> 04:19:54,079
It's just an overwhelming amount of enemies.

4278
04:19:58,860 --> 04:19:59,760
There's way too many.

4279
04:19:59,959 --> 04:20:00,659
There's so many.

4280
04:20:00,659 --> 04:20:01,860
There's like a thousand people.

4281
04:20:03,059 --> 04:20:04,559
Oh my God.

4282
04:20:05,260 --> 04:20:07,059
Explosive archers.

4283
04:20:07,559 --> 04:20:08,559
Oh my goodness.

4284
04:20:08,760 --> 04:20:10,760
That was this we just got overwhelmed.

4285
04:20:11,059 --> 04:20:11,959
I lost.

4286
04:20:12,659 --> 04:20:13,260
I lost.

4287
04:20:14,489 --> 04:20:16,190
I lost in the game and IRL.

4288
04:20:19,579 --> 04:20:20,379
We were doing good too.

4289
04:20:21,180 --> 04:20:21,680
Yeah.

4290
04:20:24,610 --> 04:20:28,110
I think we can do it.

4291
04:20:30,899 --> 04:20:34,200
I think this is our Placidusix and we could do it.

4292
04:20:36,930 --> 04:20:37,530
This is tough.

4293
04:20:40,549 --> 04:20:41,850
I understand what was going wrong.

4294
04:20:44,959 --> 04:20:46,559
I had archers behind the barricade.

4295
04:20:46,559 --> 04:20:48,659
So things were shooting at the archers at the barricade and

4296
04:20:48,659 --> 04:20:49,659
blowing up the barricade.

4297
04:20:51,659 --> 04:20:53,360
And if that barricade didn't keep going down, it would have

4298
04:20:53,360 --> 04:20:54,159
been a lot easier.

4299
04:20:56,959 --> 04:21:02,459
I feel like I'm going to reduce the amount of these.

4300
04:21:04,959 --> 04:21:09,260
We, the middle room here, I think it's overwhelmed to very

4301
04:21:09,260 --> 04:21:10,860
these rooms we get to so.

4302
04:21:13,360 --> 04:21:14,059
We get overwhelmed.

4303
04:21:14,059 --> 04:21:16,760
I think honest.

4304
04:21:17,360 --> 04:21:18,260
You want some honesty?

4305
04:21:18,360 --> 04:21:18,659
Sure.

4306
04:21:20,260 --> 04:21:24,159
I think now that the bombers are just running into my fire traps,

4307
04:21:24,159 --> 04:21:27,360
we could we could wall off that whole middle part.

4308
04:21:27,760 --> 04:21:30,159
You want to wall off that because I got I'm putting stuff up.

4309
04:21:30,159 --> 04:21:31,559
Not not immediately.

4310
04:21:31,559 --> 04:21:33,760
But like as soon as like we get pushed back to the rift room

4311
04:21:33,760 --> 04:21:35,760
and we have some extra money would be like three barricades

4312
04:21:35,760 --> 04:21:40,049
for the middle and I can protect them with fire and then

4313
04:21:40,049 --> 04:21:41,049
they'll only do left and right.

4314
04:21:41,049 --> 04:21:41,950
We won't have to worry about them.

4315
04:21:41,950 --> 04:21:43,049
Like just walking in that room.

4316
04:21:44,450 --> 04:21:45,549
Okay, honest to goodness.

4317
04:21:47,430 --> 04:21:51,129
So do we just wall it off and then just fight?

4318
04:21:51,530 --> 04:21:52,930
Do we just keep putting barricades up?

4319
04:21:53,329 --> 04:21:55,430
Just only just put barricades up every time they get destroyed.

4320
04:21:55,430 --> 04:21:56,329
Just put them up there in the middle.

4321
04:21:58,049 --> 04:22:01,049
Yeah, I'll I'll spend the money on it.

4322
04:22:01,530 --> 04:22:02,329
I have them on the bar.

4323
04:22:02,329 --> 04:22:03,770
You don't have all right.

4324
04:22:03,770 --> 04:22:06,170
So I can put it up there if I need to.

4325
04:22:06,809 --> 04:22:11,930
So in that case, I'm going to put some snow shooters in.

4326
04:22:12,030 --> 04:22:13,030
It's too high though.

4327
04:22:14,030 --> 04:22:18,709
I think that's too high or anything.

4328
04:22:18,709 --> 04:22:19,209
That's all right.

4329
04:22:20,399 --> 04:22:21,500
They should be shooting down.

4330
04:22:22,739 --> 04:22:23,040
Okay.

4331
04:22:23,040 --> 04:22:24,540
Well, they're they're ready.

4332
04:22:28,600 --> 04:22:29,799
Will they complete level?

4333
04:22:30,100 --> 04:22:30,899
Yeah, we could work.

4334
04:22:31,500 --> 04:22:32,100
This is it.

4335
04:22:32,940 --> 04:22:35,239
We learned every close big learning curve.

4336
04:22:35,239 --> 04:22:38,729
We learned like I'm I'm a high school

4337
04:22:38,729 --> 04:22:39,229
dropout.

4338
04:22:39,229 --> 04:22:40,629
Okay, so it takes me a second.

4339
04:22:44,010 --> 04:22:44,809
Stay in school.

4340
04:22:46,989 --> 04:22:47,690
Okay, we're good.

4341
04:22:48,290 --> 04:22:50,090
Yeah, let's do it.

4342
04:22:57,010 --> 04:22:58,309
They're destroying the barricade.

4343
04:22:58,309 --> 04:22:59,709
I think I just goofed up the barricade.

4344
04:22:59,709 --> 04:23:02,110
Enemies are preparing to breach one of our gates.

4345
04:23:02,709 --> 04:23:07,170
The door is down.

4346
04:23:07,569 --> 04:23:09,069
The door is down.

4347
04:23:09,469 --> 04:23:10,370
Here they come.

4348
04:23:10,870 --> 04:23:11,770
The door is down.

4349
04:23:11,770 --> 04:23:12,770
It's me grandpa.

4350
04:23:14,379 --> 04:23:16,079
They need to sell the voice packs.

4351
04:23:16,680 --> 04:23:19,479
I'd buy the grandpa MLG grandpa voice pack.

4352
04:23:22,399 --> 04:23:23,600
A couple ends up going the other way.

4353
04:23:23,600 --> 04:23:24,399
Double kill.

4354
04:23:25,299 --> 04:23:26,200
Triple kill.

4355
04:23:27,000 --> 04:23:28,200
Quadra kill.

4356
04:23:29,469 --> 04:23:30,770
Panther kill.

4357
04:23:44,899 --> 04:23:46,600
They're like a mana potion you can buy too.

4358
04:23:47,739 --> 04:23:48,239
I don't know.

4359
04:23:48,340 --> 04:23:50,940
Maybe I think I'm going to go in on that.

4360
04:23:56,739 --> 04:23:57,540
Get feared.

4361
04:24:02,860 --> 04:24:04,760
That a fake enemies at the rift or are they actually?

4362
04:24:04,760 --> 04:24:05,659
No, they came there.

4363
04:24:05,659 --> 04:24:06,559
There is a few in here.

4364
04:24:06,659 --> 04:24:07,959
And yeah, you're you're slow.

4365
04:24:08,459 --> 04:24:10,559
Your turrets are shooting right as they turn that corner.

4366
04:24:10,559 --> 04:24:11,159
It looks really good.

4367
04:24:11,159 --> 04:24:11,659
Actually.

4368
04:24:12,059 --> 04:24:12,959
That's very good.

4369
04:24:13,959 --> 04:24:16,059
There are enemies in our rift room.

4370
04:24:17,620 --> 04:24:20,610
Okay, I'm going to do the same thing in the other room.

4371
04:24:21,309 --> 04:24:22,610
I'm going to put two or three over here.

4372
04:24:23,510 --> 04:24:28,549
More enemies on the way.

4373
04:24:57,829 --> 04:25:00,329
Yeah, once I once I'm able to have enough money to seal that up,

4374
04:25:00,329 --> 04:25:02,629
I think it's going to get significantly easier.

4375
04:25:03,629 --> 04:25:11,340
Oh, yeah.

4376
04:25:11,739 --> 04:25:21,049
Oh, that was good.

4377
04:25:29,350 --> 04:25:33,250
And I also think your turrets being up here instead of like downstairs.

4378
04:25:34,350 --> 04:25:36,250
Yeah, I didn't want to say nothing last time.

4379
04:25:36,350 --> 04:25:38,049
Well, I'm really happy about it.

4380
04:25:39,049 --> 04:25:41,750
I did put a few down there because that's the only other way they're

4381
04:25:41,750 --> 04:25:45,180
coming in just to slow them down.

4382
04:26:02,639 --> 04:26:03,139
Okay, good.

4383
04:26:03,639 --> 04:26:04,340
We still got 15.

4384
04:26:04,340 --> 04:26:05,139
We got 15 lives.

4385
04:26:05,340 --> 04:26:06,440
Did you get that Trinket thing?

4386
04:26:08,309 --> 04:26:09,010
What Trinket thing?

4387
04:26:09,010 --> 04:26:10,010
We have 15 lives now.

4388
04:26:10,809 --> 04:26:11,610
Oh, yeah, I do.

4389
04:26:15,559 --> 04:26:16,760
Oh fuckers.

4390
04:26:16,760 --> 04:26:17,659
What what happened?

4391
04:26:21,030 --> 04:26:22,729
Well, we're still ahead of where we would normally be.

4392
04:26:22,729 --> 04:26:24,829
I blocked off this that area.

4393
04:26:25,430 --> 04:26:27,129
So I shouldn't be coming from the middle anymore.

4394
04:26:27,530 --> 04:26:27,930
All right, good.

4395
04:26:47,000 --> 04:26:47,500
Good.

4396
04:26:47,500 --> 04:26:48,200
Good.

4397
04:26:56,559 --> 04:26:56,959
How about over here?

4398
04:26:56,959 --> 04:26:57,360
How's over here?

4399
04:26:57,360 --> 04:27:02,840
Look this hallway.

4400
04:27:02,840 --> 04:27:04,340
I haven't built anything in it yet.

4401
04:27:04,639 --> 04:27:07,340
I've spent all my money on making so they can't come that one way.

4402
04:27:10,459 --> 04:27:12,459
Oh, there are two turrets.

4403
04:27:18,459 --> 04:27:20,559
They trying to go down the middle.

4404
04:27:20,559 --> 04:27:21,059
No, okay.

4405
04:27:26,059 --> 04:27:27,559
Other side in the herd.

4406
04:27:34,520 --> 04:27:35,920
Yeah, there's there's guy in here.

4407
04:27:38,200 --> 04:27:39,000
He needs to come back.

4408
04:27:39,299 --> 04:27:39,700
Cover.

4409
04:27:43,129 --> 04:27:44,030
Barricade down.

4410
04:27:50,139 --> 04:27:51,139
You piece of shit.

4411
04:27:51,139 --> 04:27:51,639
He got in.

4412
04:27:54,450 --> 04:27:57,049
I use the cooldown so they wouldn't count, but a little late.

4413
04:28:04,680 --> 04:28:05,079
All right.

4414
04:28:05,690 --> 04:28:07,290
Watch this side.

4415
04:28:21,780 --> 04:28:23,479
We need to start building stuff in our hallway.

4416
04:28:28,520 --> 04:28:29,520
I have a little bit of money.

4417
04:28:29,520 --> 04:28:32,219
I've been up to do one of those big spike wall things.

4418
04:28:35,850 --> 04:28:37,649
I wonder if I should put one over there.

4419
04:28:51,360 --> 04:28:52,159
I can't believe it.

4420
04:28:52,159 --> 04:28:52,959
We're doing it.

4421
04:28:53,799 --> 04:28:59,510
So far, we're really doing it.

4422
04:28:59,510 --> 04:29:06,209
Honey is the only side that has anything.

4423
04:29:08,530 --> 04:29:12,030
I'm gonna I'm gonna run to the other side and put some stuff down.

4424
04:29:13,069 --> 04:29:20,700
Yeah, like we need something to attack somebody here.

4425
04:29:27,370 --> 04:29:28,469
Well, they're all coming this way.

4426
04:29:28,969 --> 04:29:29,270
Sorry.

4427
04:29:29,469 --> 04:29:30,569
I have I fucked up.

4428
04:29:41,149 --> 04:29:43,049
Why would it be facing this way by default?

4429
04:29:56,020 --> 04:29:58,120
I gotta be ready to go sell that right now.

4430
04:29:58,520 --> 04:29:58,920
Thank God.

4431
04:30:04,469 --> 04:30:04,870
Do it.

4432
04:30:05,569 --> 04:30:07,069
More enemies.

4433
04:30:08,069 --> 04:30:09,270
Oh my goodness.

4434
04:30:10,469 --> 04:30:11,270
The mix.

4435
04:30:19,770 --> 04:30:22,069
Okay, I this this thing this damage shit in here now.

4436
04:30:29,540 --> 04:30:30,139
Where are they?

4437
04:30:30,239 --> 04:30:30,940
Where are they going?

4438
04:30:44,319 --> 04:30:51,360
I'm going to say I like that.

4439
04:30:51,459 --> 04:30:52,059
I like that.

4440
04:30:54,520 --> 04:30:55,620
Is that thing even attacking?

4441
04:30:56,520 --> 04:30:56,819
Okay.

4442
04:30:56,819 --> 04:30:57,420
Yeah, they are there.

4443
04:30:57,520 --> 04:30:58,920
I was making sure that these things are attacking.

4444
04:31:10,680 --> 04:31:11,479
How's it going up there?

4445
04:31:12,479 --> 04:31:13,379
Really good.

4446
04:31:16,110 --> 04:31:17,610
There's a lot of guys on the mini map.

4447
04:31:18,750 --> 04:31:19,350
I'm gonna come here.

4448
04:31:25,850 --> 04:31:27,450
You got one big guy on the other side.

4449
04:31:32,879 --> 04:31:35,680
What are these orcs must die symbols on the ground that you can

4450
04:31:35,680 --> 04:31:36,180
pick up?

4451
04:31:36,479 --> 04:31:38,780
I think it's money for like the upgrade.

4452
04:31:38,979 --> 04:31:40,180
Oh, yeah, I think the skulls.

4453
04:31:42,370 --> 04:31:43,770
Whoa, big guy.

4454
04:32:15,329 --> 04:32:17,729
Oh, I summon the storm above me.

4455
04:32:19,979 --> 04:32:25,739
I think we're just pretty weird.

4456
04:32:36,450 --> 04:32:37,350
Oh, they grouped up.

4457
04:32:37,350 --> 04:32:37,750
That's good.

4458
04:32:44,139 --> 04:32:44,440
Okay.

4459
04:32:44,440 --> 04:32:45,639
Well, what do we what do we need?

4460
04:32:45,639 --> 04:32:46,239
What are we missing?

4461
04:32:46,239 --> 04:32:47,340
What's what's what's the problem here?

4462
04:32:50,889 --> 04:32:53,290
Yeah, I need to just sell that car so I can build better

4463
04:32:53,290 --> 04:32:53,889
barricades.

4464
04:32:56,489 --> 04:32:57,090
What do you need me to sell?

4465
04:32:59,239 --> 04:33:01,739
This tar over here so I could do a second barricade here.

4466
04:33:02,440 --> 04:33:05,639
I think this one right here.

4467
04:33:06,240 --> 04:33:07,439
Okay, next time I'll do it.

4468
04:33:08,040 --> 04:33:09,040
All right, they're coming in the left side.

4469
04:33:31,240 --> 04:33:32,240
Bombers are coming.

4470
04:33:36,799 --> 04:33:38,299
This is the only way they're coming up right now, right?

4471
04:33:39,299 --> 04:33:49,860
Maybe to make sure they die.

4472
04:33:49,860 --> 04:33:51,459
Whatever the yellows are on the map.

4473
04:33:51,459 --> 04:33:55,560
These are these the crossbow guys apparently blow them up

4474
04:33:55,560 --> 04:33:57,860
to flaming crossbow guys.

4475
04:33:59,159 --> 04:34:06,220
Okay, where are they getting kind of stuck up?

4476
04:34:06,220 --> 04:34:19,540
Okay, so we there the fear is so good.

4477
04:34:21,639 --> 04:34:23,639
I'm so glad I was bullied into using it.

4478
04:34:27,479 --> 04:34:28,580
It's gonna keep freezing them.

4479
04:34:35,400 --> 04:34:37,500
I'm just I feel like I've been doing good with the staff.

4480
04:34:38,500 --> 04:34:40,299
We got some bombers coming there down the bottom of the

4481
04:34:40,299 --> 04:34:40,799
stairs.

4482
04:34:47,240 --> 04:34:50,639
Why why does it default to I tried to spin it?

4483
04:34:54,290 --> 04:35:00,400
God, why does it default to facing the towards you?

4484
04:35:04,319 --> 04:35:09,450
I wish I could answer that logically speaking.

4485
04:35:10,150 --> 04:35:13,950
It it feels like it's a good idea to die when they're at the

4486
04:35:13,950 --> 04:35:14,250
rift.

4487
04:35:14,250 --> 04:35:15,549
You could just spam magic.

4488
04:35:16,450 --> 04:35:18,349
Yeah, and you just when you respond there.

4489
04:35:18,950 --> 04:35:19,650
Oh, they got one.

4490
04:35:21,240 --> 04:35:22,919
Okay, please.

4491
04:35:23,319 --> 04:35:32,860
Oh my god, I'm gonna put some more up some frost after like

4492
04:35:32,860 --> 04:35:35,560
didn't down over there where they would you know anything?

4493
04:35:36,360 --> 04:35:50,630
Yeah, I think I know what you're saying.

4494
04:35:58,060 --> 04:36:00,159
Okay, they are going around here.

4495
04:36:03,849 --> 04:36:05,150
We got a lot of bombers coming.

4496
04:36:07,419 --> 04:36:08,520
Hard to read map.

4497
04:36:12,270 --> 04:36:13,369
Barricades down over here.

4498
04:36:20,740 --> 04:36:22,040
You can't because you're dead.

4499
04:36:29,009 --> 04:36:31,209
We got a lot of people coming up in a minute.

4500
04:36:34,669 --> 04:36:36,869
Her dude, I got a lot of trolls on my side that are going to

4501
04:36:36,869 --> 04:36:37,669
be hard to deal with.

4502
04:36:43,700 --> 04:36:44,500
What?

4503
04:36:45,500 --> 04:36:47,099
What it was shooting through him.

4504
04:36:55,979 --> 04:36:57,180
Okay, we got we got an issue.

4505
04:37:14,959 --> 04:37:16,659
Yeah, I have no shit.

4506
04:37:18,659 --> 04:37:19,860
Enemies in the radio.

4507
04:37:19,860 --> 04:37:21,459
Can you see what happened here?

4508
04:37:22,830 --> 04:37:27,729
There's just there's too many so many you can't how do I kill

4509
04:37:27,729 --> 04:37:28,930
that many trolls?

4510
04:37:33,669 --> 04:37:35,470
There's still two more waves.

4511
04:37:35,470 --> 04:37:41,470
Oh, they just like pile in just a two dozen omega enemies.

4512
04:37:43,169 --> 04:37:43,869
Shit.

4513
04:37:44,569 --> 04:37:46,569
We were doing we were doing all right.

4514
04:37:51,389 --> 04:37:51,889
Damn it.

4515
04:37:51,889 --> 04:37:53,790
Still they're still beating me up.

4516
04:37:54,689 --> 04:37:55,889
I thought we had it too.

4517
04:37:56,189 --> 04:37:57,590
I thought we had a good thing going there.

4518
04:38:01,639 --> 04:38:02,439
Is this possible?

4519
04:38:02,439 --> 04:38:05,040
I think part of it is that it expects you to have more of

4520
04:38:05,040 --> 04:38:07,540
the upgrades from playing the game on the easier difficulty

4521
04:38:07,540 --> 04:38:07,939
first.

4522
04:38:10,209 --> 04:38:13,110
I'm going to cope with that and say yeah, yeah, that's pretty

4523
04:38:13,110 --> 04:38:13,310
good.

4524
04:38:13,310 --> 04:38:13,709
Cope.

4525
04:38:21,549 --> 04:38:23,349
I mean, I'm I'm an addict.

4526
04:38:23,349 --> 04:38:26,250
I would just keep playing on hard.

4527
04:38:27,290 --> 04:38:28,189
Yeah, man.

4528
04:38:29,549 --> 04:38:30,650
Yeah, man.

4529
04:38:32,450 --> 04:38:33,150
I'm at that.

4530
04:38:33,150 --> 04:38:33,650
Okay.

4531
04:38:34,650 --> 04:38:37,650
Wave wave 6 was hard, right?

4532
04:38:37,650 --> 04:38:40,150
That's when all the trolls start coming and we had a hard

4533
04:38:40,150 --> 04:38:40,650
time.

4534
04:38:41,150 --> 04:38:45,959
What if on wave 6 after we destroy the bomb guys, we just

4535
04:38:45,959 --> 04:38:49,259
build more barricades on one side so that they have to go

4536
04:38:49,259 --> 04:38:52,779
the other way and then we double team one side.

4537
04:39:00,439 --> 04:39:01,040
You confident?

4538
04:39:01,540 --> 04:39:02,340
I'm confident.

4539
04:39:02,340 --> 04:39:04,540
That's like that sounds like an actionable plan.

4540
04:39:04,540 --> 04:39:06,740
I'm just going to follow you around and just kill things

4541
04:39:06,740 --> 04:39:07,040
with you.

4542
04:39:09,389 --> 04:39:10,590
When are you going to do a puppet show?

4543
04:39:11,459 --> 04:39:12,759
Um, I don't know.

4544
04:39:19,819 --> 04:39:20,819
During I already did that.

4545
04:39:21,919 --> 04:39:23,720
Remember the puppet show spring.

4546
04:39:25,720 --> 04:39:27,919
No, what's the point of that story again?

4547
04:39:28,220 --> 04:39:30,319
The gigantic orc army's genius.

4548
04:39:30,319 --> 04:39:31,919
I actually might need more damage.

4549
04:39:31,919 --> 04:39:35,619
The freeze is great, but I don't think it hurts very much.

4550
04:39:36,520 --> 04:39:37,720
Kelsey has it right.

4551
04:39:38,220 --> 04:39:41,919
These new red rifts are bringing smaller orc factions together.

4552
04:39:41,919 --> 04:39:43,720
I just think you don't need to build that many of them.

4553
04:39:45,220 --> 04:39:48,720
They were doing some pretty good work at the end, but once

4554
04:39:48,720 --> 04:39:50,220
they got through they got through and that was it.

4555
04:39:55,610 --> 04:40:00,689
Ceiling lasers people say in ceiling lasers my ceiling

4556
04:40:00,689 --> 04:40:01,290
lasers.

4557
04:40:01,590 --> 04:40:02,590
Yeah ceiling lasers.

4558
04:40:03,490 --> 04:40:06,090
I'm going back and let's do another full like refund

4559
04:40:06,090 --> 04:40:10,080
everything and try again a full.

4560
04:40:10,080 --> 04:40:10,479
Okay.

4561
04:40:10,779 --> 04:40:16,450
I mean, I'm ready, but you know, I'm going to optimize.

4562
04:40:17,840 --> 04:40:20,610
Okay, so let's do this.

4563
04:40:22,349 --> 04:40:23,549
So on Rift Lord.

4564
04:40:25,860 --> 04:40:26,659
Here we go, right?

4565
04:40:26,659 --> 04:40:27,259
Oh shit.

4566
04:40:27,259 --> 04:40:31,159
Can I upgrade my barricades because I don't think I've done

4567
04:40:31,159 --> 04:40:31,459
that.

4568
04:40:31,459 --> 04:40:32,560
I've never even looked.

4569
04:40:32,560 --> 04:40:33,159
Oh, wait, wait up.

4570
04:40:33,159 --> 04:40:33,759
But what do we read?

4571
04:40:33,959 --> 04:40:34,659
What do we read on?

4572
04:40:40,060 --> 04:40:40,959
Before this?

4573
04:40:41,459 --> 04:40:44,860
Yeah, but I quit out to here.

4574
04:40:47,919 --> 04:40:48,919
Is it even before this?

4575
04:40:50,000 --> 04:40:51,900
Click the book at the bottom, right?

4576
04:40:51,900 --> 04:40:52,299
Oh, it's the book.

4577
04:40:52,299 --> 04:40:52,700
Okay.

4578
04:40:53,000 --> 04:40:53,400
All right.

4579
04:40:55,110 --> 04:40:56,310
I got to get a new strategy.

4580
04:40:58,650 --> 04:41:00,349
People saying ceiling lasers are amazing.

4581
04:41:00,349 --> 04:41:03,750
So I want to I'm going to get ceiling laser barricades block

4582
04:41:03,750 --> 04:41:05,650
two spaces increase costs.

4583
04:41:06,349 --> 04:41:12,849
That's that's kind of probably good increase health and yeah,

4584
04:41:12,849 --> 04:41:14,049
what am I what?

4585
04:41:15,180 --> 04:41:17,380
Okay games over games over dude.

4586
04:41:17,779 --> 04:41:20,959
Yeah, we win gives over.

4587
04:41:21,060 --> 04:41:23,860
Yeah, it was fucking it's it's all over.

4588
04:41:30,169 --> 04:41:32,669
Okay, the jar of ghosts is now a lot better.

4589
04:41:35,700 --> 04:41:37,900
So I got ceiling lasers.

4590
04:41:43,439 --> 04:41:47,029
So what about what should I get?

4591
04:41:47,029 --> 04:41:48,029
What should I use for a weapon?

4592
04:41:48,130 --> 04:41:51,430
I feel like the that arcane stuff is doing pretty good.

4593
04:41:51,430 --> 04:41:53,930
But I think it looked good.

4594
04:41:54,430 --> 04:41:58,799
I think also just focus on as few things as you can fully

4595
04:41:58,799 --> 04:41:59,400
upgrade it.

4596
04:41:59,900 --> 04:42:05,040
Yeah, and then like with your extra by trinkets, okay,

4597
04:42:05,139 --> 04:42:08,040
because I should be able to upgrade it all now, at least

4598
04:42:08,040 --> 04:42:08,639
let's see.

4599
04:42:08,639 --> 04:42:09,139
Where is it?

4600
04:42:18,889 --> 04:42:21,189
Free secondary radius or mana cost probably not.

4601
04:42:24,310 --> 04:42:24,509
All right.

4602
04:42:24,509 --> 04:42:26,909
So I have ceiling lasers leveled up all the way.

4603
04:42:26,909 --> 04:42:29,110
I have my arcane staff maxed out all the way.

4604
04:42:30,250 --> 04:42:32,049
I've got the jar of ghosts all the way.

4605
04:42:32,650 --> 04:42:38,959
I can do one more thing tar all the way I can.

4606
04:42:40,060 --> 04:42:42,659
Yeah, you do tar and I'm going to do the floor the fire

4607
04:42:42,659 --> 04:42:43,159
floors.

4608
04:42:45,439 --> 04:42:48,240
I cannot I don't have enough points to do the fire damage

4609
04:42:48,240 --> 04:42:48,639
increase.

4610
04:42:48,639 --> 04:42:50,740
I just have enough to do the make it even slower.

4611
04:42:53,630 --> 04:42:55,889
Okay, and I'm not ready.

4612
04:42:58,689 --> 04:42:59,889
Only he wins.

4613
04:42:59,889 --> 04:43:06,950
I'm going to go play Bioshock which one did you get the

4614
04:43:06,950 --> 04:43:07,750
laser ceilings?

4615
04:43:07,849 --> 04:43:08,250
I did.

4616
04:43:12,939 --> 04:43:15,939
I'm just going to put tar traps down and laser ceilings

4617
04:43:15,939 --> 04:43:20,430
above in those little corner rooms and hope it works.

4618
04:43:20,930 --> 04:43:21,930
Okay, I'm ready.

4619
04:43:22,330 --> 04:43:23,029
All right, let's go.

4620
04:43:25,549 --> 04:43:26,250
Are you ready?

4621
04:43:28,110 --> 04:43:28,509
Yeah.

4622
04:43:28,810 --> 04:43:29,610
Oh now I'm ready.

4623
04:43:33,400 --> 04:43:36,599
Yeah, I didn't all of the barricade upgrades are reduced

4624
04:43:36,599 --> 04:43:37,099
cost.

4625
04:43:37,900 --> 04:43:40,799
So depending how cheap they are long after that.

4626
04:43:40,900 --> 04:43:47,799
Yeah, they're usually 800 they cost 600 that's a lot afraid

4627
04:43:47,799 --> 04:43:49,000
of what he might do.

4628
04:43:49,400 --> 04:43:52,000
So what was the point of that story again?

4629
04:43:52,299 --> 04:43:54,900
The gigantic ork army's genius.

4630
04:43:55,200 --> 04:43:57,900
They haven't been seen since the days of Master Cygnus

4631
04:43:57,900 --> 04:43:59,400
and Borwick my loadout.

4632
04:43:59,400 --> 04:44:00,200
They're back.

4633
04:44:00,299 --> 04:44:04,799
I'm okay with these new red wrists are bringing smaller

4634
04:44:04,799 --> 04:44:05,599
orc factions.

4635
04:44:05,599 --> 04:44:09,700
How big is all this thing is huge not seen since the laser

4636
04:44:09,700 --> 04:44:13,099
ceiling thing is across the entire ceiling trap it up.

4637
04:44:13,840 --> 04:44:16,139
Well, let's ready up and look at that.

4638
04:44:17,139 --> 04:44:20,549
So does it aim at them through it?

4639
04:44:25,970 --> 04:44:30,860
You should put it by the stairs right here where I am.

4640
04:44:35,290 --> 04:44:36,689
You can rotate it long ways.

4641
04:44:37,389 --> 04:44:38,389
I do more than one.

4642
04:44:39,700 --> 04:44:41,000
I think you should do one on both stairs.

4643
04:44:41,000 --> 04:44:45,169
Yeah, I want to tar it up over here.

4644
04:44:50,729 --> 04:44:52,630
That that looks okay.

4645
04:44:54,000 --> 04:44:57,500
I don't have enough to do should I prioritize the tar or

4646
04:44:57,500 --> 04:45:00,340
should I prioritize putting another one over there another

4647
04:45:00,340 --> 04:45:03,340
one over there because they should also kill the the bombers

4648
04:45:03,840 --> 04:45:06,639
Okay, and you talk about like over here and I can save money

4649
04:45:06,639 --> 04:45:09,639
on focusing on barricades like right here.

4650
04:45:11,490 --> 04:45:13,290
You mean this spot right here, right?

4651
04:45:13,590 --> 04:45:13,990
Yeah.

4652
04:45:16,819 --> 04:45:20,409
Okay, then I'm gonna put all my money into barricade.

4653
04:45:20,509 --> 04:45:21,610
I can put another one.

4654
04:45:21,610 --> 04:45:24,209
Is there another spot that we need it's gonna be all my money

4655
04:45:24,209 --> 04:45:29,849
but I don't think so because upstairs doesn't know then I'll

4656
04:45:29,849 --> 04:45:30,750
start putting tar down.

4657
04:45:35,080 --> 04:45:36,080
But one on the other side too.

4658
04:45:45,290 --> 04:45:47,889
Well, I guess I'm ready.

4659
04:45:49,400 --> 04:45:50,099
I'm a believer.

4660
04:45:50,200 --> 04:45:53,000
We just just remind me when it's like wave six.

4661
04:45:53,299 --> 04:45:56,900
Okay, we need to close another doorway.

4662
04:46:40,959 --> 04:46:41,659
I'm the healer.

4663
04:46:43,459 --> 04:46:44,860
Yeah, I like to play support.

4664
04:46:44,860 --> 04:46:45,759
I don't spend any of my money.

4665
04:46:45,759 --> 04:46:49,040
I just feel what's with this going for me.

4666
04:46:49,439 --> 04:46:50,840
We got runners going up.

4667
04:46:56,310 --> 04:46:59,709
Their headshots probably not there are there are it might

4668
04:46:59,709 --> 04:47:00,509
depend on the weapon.

4669
04:47:00,509 --> 04:47:02,409
But yeah, you do a lot more damage with that shot.

4670
04:47:03,970 --> 04:47:05,169
I think the staff was doing them.

4671
04:47:05,169 --> 04:47:09,270
You have to like aim oddly up into the right.

4672
04:47:09,569 --> 04:47:11,169
We should probably work to hit things.

4673
04:47:11,869 --> 04:47:14,270
Yeah, we got a lot of money now, too.

4674
04:47:17,740 --> 04:47:21,580
Okay, I'm gonna put another ceiling shooter.

4675
04:47:22,639 --> 04:47:24,840
It does concern me that you just now realize there's headshots

4676
04:47:24,840 --> 04:47:25,240
though.

4677
04:47:25,639 --> 04:47:26,939
I had no idea.

4678
04:47:30,119 --> 04:47:30,819
Oh boy.

4679
04:47:30,819 --> 04:47:31,619
Oh boy.

4680
04:47:31,619 --> 04:47:35,720
I yeah, okay, you can hurt people with the headshot.

4681
04:47:36,720 --> 04:47:37,119
Sir.

4682
04:47:39,659 --> 04:47:40,259
Yes.

4683
04:47:40,659 --> 04:47:41,360
Yes, you can.

4684
04:47:42,369 --> 04:47:43,069
It hurts a lot.

4685
04:47:43,069 --> 04:47:47,169
It's you basically can't hurt like the elementals without

4686
04:47:47,169 --> 04:47:47,970
headshotting them.

4687
04:47:50,799 --> 04:47:52,700
Speaking of which there's some getting into the rift room.

4688
04:47:52,700 --> 04:47:53,299
I need help.

4689
04:48:06,560 --> 04:48:09,459
I feel like I have actually been instinctively shooting at

4690
04:48:09,459 --> 04:48:09,860
the head.

4691
04:48:10,930 --> 04:48:12,630
So I don't think it's problem.

4692
04:48:13,860 --> 04:48:16,040
I hope Charlie.

4693
04:48:42,669 --> 04:48:43,669
Such a liar.

4694
04:48:54,250 --> 04:48:55,349
Hey good middle.

4695
04:48:57,939 --> 04:48:59,040
Me is at the Rift.

4696
04:49:05,419 --> 04:49:07,819
I'm trying to save my money so I can block the middle room

4697
04:49:08,020 --> 04:49:09,619
and defend it.

4698
04:49:09,720 --> 04:49:11,020
We got guys in the room.

4699
04:49:12,020 --> 04:49:27,869
There are enemies in our rift room.

4700
04:49:29,069 --> 04:49:31,810
Okay, I'm blocking this.

4701
04:49:33,200 --> 04:49:34,900
More enemies all the way.

4702
04:49:34,900 --> 04:49:36,000
Why do it too?

4703
04:49:36,000 --> 04:49:36,799
No, don't.

4704
04:49:38,229 --> 04:49:41,299
But nothing walks here when I block it.

4705
04:49:41,400 --> 04:49:42,299
If I buy at the end.

4706
04:49:44,099 --> 04:49:44,500
Okay.

4707
04:49:44,500 --> 04:49:45,500
Well, it's not the end yet.

4708
04:49:45,500 --> 04:49:46,900
We have a wave six.

4709
04:49:46,900 --> 04:49:49,200
That's I'm preparing for wave six.

4710
04:49:49,799 --> 04:49:51,099
I'm preparing for wave six.

4711
04:49:53,099 --> 04:49:54,799
They keep coming up there in wave six.

4712
04:49:57,790 --> 04:49:59,090
Make sure you make sure your head shot him.

4713
04:49:59,389 --> 04:50:16,299
I will be good.

4714
04:50:17,799 --> 04:50:18,799
I might need a little help.

4715
04:50:46,709 --> 04:50:49,409
Like a lot of money, you know, you got money.

4716
04:50:50,110 --> 04:50:53,310
No, I'm saying it just seemed like a lot of money to build

4717
04:50:53,310 --> 04:50:53,909
those there.

4718
04:50:54,409 --> 04:50:56,009
Okay, we got guys in here again.

4719
04:50:56,810 --> 04:50:58,409
Yeah, there's a lot of people on this side though.

4720
04:51:18,430 --> 04:51:19,630
No, no, no, no, no.

4721
04:51:22,880 --> 04:51:33,959
Oh, there are enemies in our room.

4722
04:51:33,959 --> 04:51:36,959
We need to go find the shaman who's summoning these.

4723
04:51:39,409 --> 04:51:42,009
No, no jokes are allowed until we win.

4724
04:51:43,409 --> 04:51:43,810
Okay.

4725
04:52:16,000 --> 04:52:16,599
Hey guys.

4726
04:52:17,099 --> 04:52:18,500
Yeah, in the game.

4727
04:52:32,450 --> 04:52:32,849
All right.

4728
04:52:32,849 --> 04:52:33,849
What do we need?

4729
04:52:33,849 --> 04:52:34,349
What do we need?

4730
04:52:34,349 --> 04:52:35,549
What what what do we need?

4731
04:52:35,950 --> 04:52:39,549
We need a we need like to defend this path more and the

4732
04:52:39,549 --> 04:52:41,849
other path has nothing in it where we need to kill the

4733
04:52:41,849 --> 04:52:42,650
bombers before anything.

4734
04:52:42,849 --> 04:52:43,150
Okay.

4735
04:52:43,150 --> 04:52:43,349
Okay.

4736
04:52:48,090 --> 04:52:49,990
We'll go straight for barricades.

4737
04:52:50,490 --> 04:52:51,290
I believe so.

4738
04:52:53,400 --> 04:52:56,700
They will absolutely smash any females that comes across

4739
04:52:56,700 --> 04:52:57,200
their path.

4740
04:53:22,229 --> 04:53:25,020
Sure are.

4741
04:53:30,759 --> 04:53:31,860
Okay, let's look.

4742
04:53:31,860 --> 04:53:32,259
All right.

4743
04:53:34,950 --> 04:53:36,250
He's focused on his new toy.

4744
04:53:36,250 --> 04:53:37,349
He doesn't care about strategy.

4745
04:53:37,349 --> 04:53:39,650
He just wants to see how many lasers he can buy it.

4746
04:53:40,819 --> 04:53:44,119
There's truth to that, but not as much as you think there

4747
04:53:44,119 --> 04:53:44,919
is truth to that.

4748
04:53:44,919 --> 04:53:46,119
But look at this.

4749
04:53:48,790 --> 04:53:49,990
Check this out.

4750
04:53:49,990 --> 04:53:50,590
Watch that left.

4751
04:53:50,590 --> 04:53:51,090
Watch out.

4752
04:53:51,090 --> 04:53:51,790
Watch that left side.

4753
04:53:52,689 --> 04:53:56,759
I'm going over coming.

4754
04:54:00,209 --> 04:54:01,209
I'm going to need help.

4755
04:54:01,610 --> 04:54:02,009
Yep.

4756
04:54:05,150 --> 04:54:05,549
You okay?

4757
04:54:06,819 --> 04:54:11,180
Oh, they can't walk in.

4758
04:54:11,180 --> 04:54:12,080
I used my thingy.

4759
04:54:14,240 --> 04:54:15,340
But I think one did get in.

4760
04:54:23,680 --> 04:54:26,900
The barricade is down.

4761
04:54:35,110 --> 04:54:39,110
Enemies at the Rift.

4762
04:54:40,119 --> 04:54:41,220
There's enemies in our Rift room, dude.

4763
04:54:43,689 --> 04:54:43,990
What?

4764
04:54:53,590 --> 04:54:55,689
There are enemies in our Rift room.

4765
04:55:10,819 --> 04:55:13,520
I'm going to put some more lasers up there.

4766
04:55:15,040 --> 04:55:15,340
Okay.

4767
04:55:19,880 --> 04:55:20,779
Oh, wow.

4768
04:55:25,049 --> 04:55:26,849
All right, we're about to get good to me.

4769
04:55:26,849 --> 04:55:28,150
There's one enemy left.

4770
04:55:28,650 --> 04:55:29,549
We got a second here.

4771
04:55:29,549 --> 04:55:30,849
What what do we need?

4772
04:55:32,750 --> 04:55:33,750
I think you need.

4773
04:55:36,110 --> 04:55:36,709
Why'd you kill it?

4774
04:55:36,709 --> 04:55:37,709
I don't I don't know.

4775
04:55:37,709 --> 04:55:39,009
Like I don't know what we need.

4776
04:55:39,009 --> 04:55:40,009
We just need more.

4777
04:55:40,610 --> 04:55:42,110
I killed him because I'm in gamer mode.

4778
04:55:43,220 --> 04:55:45,319
No, I freaking freaked out.

4779
04:55:45,720 --> 04:55:46,819
I got to fix that.

4780
04:55:47,020 --> 04:55:47,919
Watch out.

4781
04:55:48,319 --> 04:55:50,319
Enemies are broken through again.

4782
04:55:50,319 --> 04:55:50,919
I pressed it.

4783
04:55:50,919 --> 04:55:52,020
I just you know what I mean?

4784
04:55:52,119 --> 04:55:57,880
You know, sometimes it goes like I need tar on this side.

4785
04:55:57,979 --> 04:55:59,380
Yep, like right right here.

4786
04:55:59,380 --> 04:55:59,779
Yep.

4787
04:56:19,029 --> 04:56:21,830
Is that jar that makes them run just like always active?

4788
04:56:22,529 --> 04:56:23,229
I don't know.

4789
04:56:23,729 --> 04:56:26,029
Does that null hit you and just walked away?

4790
04:56:28,060 --> 04:56:28,959
All right, hard down.

4791
04:56:46,860 --> 04:56:47,860
Same side, right?

4792
04:56:48,759 --> 04:56:49,159
Yeah.

4793
04:56:58,509 --> 04:57:00,009
That staff is really good.

4794
04:57:00,889 --> 04:57:01,689
No, it's great.

4795
04:57:02,389 --> 04:57:03,090
That's awesome.

4796
04:57:24,150 --> 04:57:25,849
Spend so much money fixing those.

4797
04:57:34,189 --> 04:57:36,189
These these archers, dude.

4798
04:57:36,590 --> 04:57:37,490
Yeah, they're awful.

4799
04:57:49,229 --> 04:57:49,830
Hey stir.

4800
04:57:49,930 --> 04:57:51,430
We are about to be on wave 6.

4801
04:57:52,029 --> 04:57:53,029
Do not kill that guy.

4802
04:57:53,029 --> 04:57:53,529
Let him roll.

4803
04:57:53,529 --> 04:57:54,630
Oh, he's gonna die from the lasers.

4804
04:57:55,130 --> 04:57:55,630
So what?

4805
04:57:56,430 --> 04:57:57,130
How are we?

4806
04:57:59,040 --> 04:58:03,040
We are I'm gonna block this whole path.

4807
04:58:03,939 --> 04:58:06,139
So sell this tar immediately.

4808
04:58:06,139 --> 04:58:07,939
Once this is so all this right here.

4809
04:58:07,939 --> 04:58:09,439
So everything here besides very good.

4810
04:58:11,139 --> 04:58:12,240
What even the stuff downstairs?

4811
04:58:13,040 --> 04:58:15,040
No, no, just like this thing on the wall.

4812
04:58:15,040 --> 04:58:16,240
Okay, so I got it.

4813
04:58:16,340 --> 04:58:19,340
I can sell your stuff and I'm gonna barricade here and then

4814
04:58:19,340 --> 04:58:21,540
we're gonna presume that they're gonna go only the other

4815
04:58:21,540 --> 04:58:21,840
way.

4816
04:58:21,939 --> 04:58:22,139
All right.

4817
04:58:22,139 --> 04:58:24,040
So now I'm I got money.

4818
04:58:24,040 --> 04:58:25,740
Where should I should I stack middle?

4819
04:58:27,250 --> 04:58:29,250
Or this this side needs some help over there.

4820
04:58:29,250 --> 04:58:31,349
They're only yeah, they're only coming that side now.

4821
04:58:32,349 --> 04:58:32,650
Okay.

4822
04:58:34,779 --> 04:58:35,080
I'm aware.

4823
04:58:35,080 --> 04:58:35,880
I am right now, right?

4824
04:58:36,580 --> 04:58:36,880
Yeah.

4825
04:58:44,830 --> 04:58:45,529
Eat shit.

4826
04:58:45,930 --> 04:58:46,830
We're ready this time.

4827
04:58:48,599 --> 04:58:49,400
We're ready this time.

4828
04:58:49,799 --> 04:58:50,599
Evil villains.

4829
04:58:56,419 --> 04:58:56,819
You're right.

4830
04:58:57,419 --> 04:58:57,819
Yeah.

4831
04:58:58,700 --> 04:58:58,900
Okay.

4832
04:58:58,900 --> 04:59:00,200
Yeah, they're all only coming this way.

4833
04:59:04,619 --> 04:59:06,319
I have this so many lasers over there too.

4834
04:59:07,220 --> 04:59:08,119
It's ridiculous.

4835
04:59:13,029 --> 04:59:14,529
If you if you turn the corner, you're gonna laugh.

4836
04:59:14,529 --> 04:59:15,229
It's a joke.

4837
04:59:15,229 --> 04:59:15,930
How much did you have?

4838
04:59:19,229 --> 04:59:20,330
Okay, I have to go look.

4839
04:59:22,819 --> 04:59:23,419
Yeah.

4840
04:59:25,610 --> 04:59:25,810
All right.

4841
04:59:25,810 --> 04:59:26,610
Watch that other side.

4842
04:59:29,000 --> 04:59:30,099
Bombers are coming the other way.

4843
04:59:30,500 --> 04:59:30,799
Yep.

4844
04:59:31,000 --> 04:59:32,200
Can't let the Bombers get through.

4845
04:59:42,110 --> 04:59:42,610
Okay, we're good.

4846
04:59:50,360 --> 04:59:51,060
We're going over this side.

4847
04:59:51,060 --> 04:59:53,159
Okay, which we can ping the map.

4848
04:59:53,259 --> 04:59:54,159
I like what we're looking at.

4849
04:59:54,860 --> 04:59:57,159
Any game that doesn't have that now feels like it should have

4850
04:59:57,159 --> 04:59:57,360
it.

4851
04:59:59,400 --> 05:00:01,299
All right, you had that hit at that left side.

4852
05:00:02,540 --> 05:00:03,740
No, they're not going up.

4853
05:00:03,840 --> 05:00:04,840
Oh, they're not going up.

4854
05:00:04,840 --> 05:00:05,240
That's right.

4855
05:00:05,240 --> 05:00:05,840
Okay around.

4856
05:00:20,580 --> 05:00:20,779
Yep.

4857
05:00:20,779 --> 05:00:21,680
They're not going up.

4858
05:00:21,979 --> 05:00:22,380
Okay, good.

4859
05:00:22,979 --> 05:00:25,380
We just need to if there's ever any yellow on the mini map.

4860
05:00:25,380 --> 05:00:26,080
It's a problem.

4861
05:00:54,959 --> 05:00:58,159
You don't have those feeling no cannons anymore.

4862
05:00:58,159 --> 05:00:58,560
Do you?

4863
05:00:58,560 --> 05:00:59,159
I do not.

4864
05:01:00,540 --> 05:01:01,340
Bombers are coming.

4865
05:01:01,639 --> 05:01:02,740
I'm going to check the other wall.

4866
05:01:02,740 --> 05:01:03,040
Yep.

4867
05:01:14,360 --> 05:01:15,259
Hopefully they don't break it.

4868
05:01:15,259 --> 05:01:16,860
I can't really look at them right now.

4869
05:01:18,389 --> 05:01:19,290
I'm okay over here.

4870
05:01:19,290 --> 05:01:20,090
You need to go over there.

4871
05:01:21,259 --> 05:01:22,959
Okay, there's like two layers of wall.

4872
05:01:22,959 --> 05:01:24,959
So I'm saving my money.

4873
05:01:25,259 --> 05:01:25,459
All right.

4874
05:01:25,459 --> 05:01:26,159
This is clear.

4875
05:01:27,680 --> 05:01:27,979
Okay.

4876
05:01:27,979 --> 05:01:30,080
Yeah, they walked around bombers are coming the other way though,

4877
05:01:30,080 --> 05:01:30,880
but it shouldn't matter.

4878
05:01:31,180 --> 05:01:31,380
Yep.

4879
05:01:31,380 --> 05:01:31,680
Got him.

4880
05:01:35,330 --> 05:01:36,630
I guess there's two bombers coming in this way.

4881
05:01:36,630 --> 05:01:37,330
I'll take care of it.

4882
05:01:45,090 --> 05:01:45,290
Shit.

4883
05:01:45,290 --> 05:01:45,990
I didn't heal you in time.

4884
05:01:45,990 --> 05:01:46,290
Sorry.

4885
05:01:46,590 --> 05:01:47,189
No, I'm fine.

4886
05:01:47,689 --> 05:01:57,139
I get to come back in the convenient place looking good.

4887
05:02:04,159 --> 05:02:05,959
It's pretty messy over here, but it's okay.

4888
05:02:07,599 --> 05:02:08,700
There's one guy left.

4889
05:02:09,400 --> 05:02:10,000
I can clean this up.

4890
05:02:10,000 --> 05:02:10,700
Okay, this though.

4891
05:02:11,200 --> 05:02:16,159
I haven't spent my money yet.

4892
05:02:18,970 --> 05:02:19,470
He's on it.

4893
05:02:19,470 --> 05:02:20,470
He's gonna die in a second.

4894
05:02:20,569 --> 05:02:22,069
He's literally walking through the lasers like right now.

4895
05:02:22,470 --> 05:02:22,770
Okay.

4896
05:02:28,990 --> 05:02:30,189
Hold some of your car up here.

4897
05:02:36,259 --> 05:02:36,560
All right.

4898
05:02:37,759 --> 05:02:40,159
Whoa, that's a lot of those things.

4899
05:02:44,729 --> 05:02:46,229
Thankfully they all came this way.

4900
05:02:48,959 --> 05:02:49,259
Okay.

4901
05:02:49,259 --> 05:02:50,459
We're we're all right.

4902
05:02:50,459 --> 05:02:51,959
That was a lot of guys.

4903
05:02:52,459 --> 05:02:52,759
All right.

4904
05:02:52,759 --> 05:02:54,860
I think that place that's safe over there for a little while.

4905
05:02:56,060 --> 05:02:59,189
Where are we prioritizing the guys on?

4906
05:03:00,090 --> 05:03:04,330
They should only be coming on the bridge.

4907
05:03:13,060 --> 05:03:15,259
Keeping an eye on the map in case something weird happens.

4908
05:03:16,270 --> 05:03:16,869
Like the others.

4909
05:03:17,069 --> 05:03:17,869
There's more guys.

4910
05:03:18,069 --> 05:03:18,970
There's more bombers.

4911
05:03:19,669 --> 05:03:21,569
They're not the lasers will kill him instantly when they walk

4912
05:03:21,569 --> 05:03:21,970
through her.

4913
05:03:25,130 --> 05:03:25,229
All right.

4914
05:03:25,229 --> 05:03:32,259
We've got every angle is being problems, but they should only

4915
05:03:32,259 --> 05:03:33,159
be coming this way.

4916
05:03:34,130 --> 05:03:34,630
Hope so.

4917
05:03:35,130 --> 05:03:36,229
Just keeping an eye on it.

4918
05:03:42,259 --> 05:03:44,560
If anything slips through I have the they can't go in the

4919
05:03:44,560 --> 05:03:45,259
rip button.

4920
05:03:45,360 --> 05:03:45,759
Good.

4921
05:03:54,639 --> 05:03:56,139
There's so many big enemies.

4922
05:03:56,139 --> 05:03:57,139
It's ridiculous.

4923
05:04:03,840 --> 05:04:08,240
It is uncomfortable that this is still like a how are we ever

4924
05:04:08,740 --> 05:04:17,560
with this before and I don't know one way what is hitting us

4925
05:04:17,560 --> 05:04:20,159
something to shoot us or something like an archer all the

4926
05:04:20,159 --> 05:04:21,959
way that shooting over bombers.

4927
05:04:21,959 --> 05:04:22,159
Okay.

4928
05:04:22,159 --> 05:04:31,740
Yeah, they're hitting the lasers and dying attacking the

4929
05:04:31,740 --> 05:04:34,939
barricade where we're good.

4930
05:04:35,040 --> 05:04:35,439
We're good.

4931
05:04:36,040 --> 05:04:38,439
It's right where you were the barricade that's right here.

4932
05:04:44,889 --> 05:04:45,790
God damn it.

4933
05:04:46,990 --> 05:04:48,790
When you put something on the ground and click this sometimes

4934
05:04:48,790 --> 05:04:49,590
it not happen.

4935
05:04:51,709 --> 05:04:52,310
Me problem.

4936
05:05:09,919 --> 05:05:12,419
I think using these wall grinders have helped a lot too.

4937
05:05:12,419 --> 05:05:30,049
Yeah, they do a lot of damage looking good should be one more

4938
05:05:30,049 --> 05:05:33,650
wave as soon as this wave ends be aware of any Bomber.

4939
05:05:33,750 --> 05:05:34,150
Yep.

4940
05:05:34,250 --> 05:05:36,250
And then if we can handle that we're probably okay.

4941
05:05:40,139 --> 05:05:42,740
I'm just going to fill the rest of this room with lasers like

4942
05:05:42,740 --> 05:05:43,840
it's going to be the whole hallway.

4943
05:05:56,150 --> 05:05:57,950
I think you should put them in this room where all the grinders

4944
05:05:57,950 --> 05:06:00,750
are walking around the barricades.

4945
05:06:00,750 --> 05:06:02,049
I don't think they go down that far.

4946
05:06:02,049 --> 05:06:03,049
They don't fit on the ceiling.

4947
05:06:03,650 --> 05:06:04,950
Oh, yeah, they can't go up there.

4948
05:06:07,689 --> 05:06:08,090
All right.

4949
05:06:08,389 --> 05:06:12,389
Only if you love are we having then you should put tar all

4950
05:06:12,389 --> 05:06:13,389
along that path.

4951
05:06:13,590 --> 05:06:15,189
Yeah, I'm going to just go to that.

4952
05:06:17,509 --> 05:06:21,110
I mean in the where the barricades are where you are

4953
05:06:21,110 --> 05:06:21,610
right now.

4954
05:06:22,110 --> 05:06:25,220
Yeah, so just like tar tar tar tar tar all over here.

4955
05:06:25,919 --> 05:06:26,419
You got it.

4956
05:06:34,349 --> 05:06:34,849
All right.

4957
05:06:35,549 --> 05:06:36,150
Here they come.

4958
05:06:39,049 --> 05:06:39,750
Where are they going?

4959
05:06:44,380 --> 05:06:44,979
They got me.

4960
05:06:46,880 --> 05:06:48,080
I think they're all going to run down this hall.

4961
05:06:48,080 --> 05:06:48,880
So I think we're all right.

4962
05:06:50,880 --> 05:06:51,180
Yep.

4963
05:06:59,669 --> 05:06:59,970
All right.

4964
05:06:59,970 --> 05:07:00,569
How we doing?

4965
05:07:01,500 --> 05:07:01,900
Good.

4966
05:07:06,319 --> 05:07:07,819
They're going to have to come down this hall, right?

4967
05:07:08,849 --> 05:07:09,750
There's no other way to place it.

4968
05:07:09,750 --> 05:07:10,150
No.

4969
05:07:10,750 --> 05:07:11,049
Yep.

4970
05:07:19,979 --> 05:07:20,279
Yep.

4971
05:07:20,279 --> 05:07:20,979
Here they are.

4972
05:07:33,360 --> 05:07:34,860
There's so many enemies.

4973
05:07:34,860 --> 05:07:36,459
Heart is ridiculous.

4974
05:07:36,459 --> 05:07:37,159
This is brutal.

4975
05:07:41,130 --> 05:07:42,529
This is fucking brutal.

4976
05:07:55,240 --> 05:07:56,439
These orcs gotta die.

4977
05:08:06,500 --> 05:08:08,000
What are the green dogs on the map?

4978
05:08:08,799 --> 05:08:10,799
Yeah, I think those are things that are killing us that are

4979
05:08:10,799 --> 05:08:11,700
shooting us from far away.

4980
05:08:22,680 --> 05:08:23,979
Yeah, I put these push walls in here.

4981
05:08:23,979 --> 05:08:25,380
It feels like they're just stuck now.

4982
05:08:32,979 --> 05:08:41,759
Oh, I heard doubters are shitting and screaming.

4983
05:08:49,000 --> 05:08:49,900
The only way to shit.

4984
05:09:00,259 --> 05:09:02,459
Oh, the green things I think are mana potions.

4985
05:09:03,400 --> 05:09:04,599
Oh, okay.

4986
05:09:17,830 --> 05:09:18,930
Somebody said hallway.

4987
05:09:18,930 --> 05:09:19,930
I'm ruined.

4988
05:09:34,500 --> 05:09:37,900
Money money always believe in the banana bros.

4989
05:09:37,900 --> 05:09:38,400
That's right.

4990
05:09:40,299 --> 05:09:42,099
We're going to do it eventually.

4991
05:09:49,220 --> 05:09:51,020
I mean, we're lapping toad right now.

4992
05:09:51,319 --> 05:09:52,520
Like they can't even come in this room.

4993
05:09:53,880 --> 05:09:54,580
Second lap.

4994
05:09:54,580 --> 05:09:55,779
Yeah, we've second lap toad.

4995
05:09:55,779 --> 05:09:56,080
I know.

4996
05:10:00,869 --> 05:10:04,650
Unfortunately, chat is toad or the doubters.

4997
05:10:19,060 --> 05:10:20,259
It's kind of hard to hit in the head.

4998
05:10:29,189 --> 05:10:30,290
I'll take a three stars.

4999
05:10:30,290 --> 05:10:31,290
Yeah, let's go.

5000
05:10:31,590 --> 05:10:33,689
Hey, most McDonald's are three.

5001
05:10:34,389 --> 05:10:35,090
I'm okay with that.

5002
05:10:36,450 --> 05:10:38,150
Most McDonald's are three stars.

5003
05:10:38,250 --> 05:10:41,250
Most McDonald's sit between like 2.5 and like three.

5004
05:10:41,549 --> 05:10:42,150
I think that's good.

5005
05:10:42,150 --> 05:10:42,750
I think we're fine.

5006
05:10:47,180 --> 05:10:49,680
I think I got like 14 upgrade skulls from that though.

5007
05:10:54,400 --> 05:10:55,599
Additional lasers.

5008
05:10:56,099 --> 05:10:57,200
I kind of like that.

5009
05:11:00,889 --> 05:11:02,389
Just a quick question for you.

5010
05:11:02,689 --> 05:11:06,189
Yeah, just to make sure that we understand the you know,

5011
05:11:06,189 --> 05:11:07,590
the remainder of the stream time.

5012
05:11:08,689 --> 05:11:11,790
Are you are we playing this for a while or are you playing

5013
05:11:11,790 --> 05:11:13,790
Five Nights at Freddy's or you just what's the deal here?

5014
05:11:14,689 --> 05:11:15,490
What do you want?

5015
05:11:15,689 --> 05:11:16,490
I mean, I'm up to you.

5016
05:11:16,490 --> 05:11:17,290
I'm enjoying this.

5017
05:11:18,189 --> 05:11:19,990
I'm I'm an enjoyer.

5018
05:11:20,189 --> 05:11:20,490
Okay.

5019
05:11:22,560 --> 05:11:24,259
I think like we just look we just like got it.

5020
05:11:24,259 --> 05:11:24,959
You know what I mean?

5021
05:11:25,560 --> 05:11:27,759
Like it like we just got it.

5022
05:11:29,590 --> 05:11:31,290
Well chat seems disagree.

5023
05:11:31,889 --> 05:11:33,490
Chats like Five Nights at Freddy's.

5024
05:11:33,490 --> 05:11:34,389
Let's go.

5025
05:11:35,090 --> 05:11:35,290
Okay.

5026
05:11:35,290 --> 05:11:37,790
I mean we did just play this one level for like four hours.

5027
05:11:38,189 --> 05:11:38,889
That's true.

5028
05:11:42,180 --> 05:11:44,979
Well, I mean we even we've been gaming.

5029
05:11:44,979 --> 05:11:47,979
Are you are you like in a funny Five Nights at Freddy's mode

5030
05:11:47,979 --> 05:11:49,180
or do you just want to chill and play?

5031
05:11:50,700 --> 05:11:50,900
Good.

5032
05:11:50,900 --> 05:11:52,900
No, don't pressure stir in doing this.

5033
05:11:53,970 --> 05:11:57,770
It's what if whatever stir wants to do is Five Nights at

5034
05:11:57,770 --> 05:11:59,169
Freddy's ha ha funny.

5035
05:11:59,770 --> 05:12:07,250
I mean, it's yeah, I want to do the next stage and then we'll

5036
05:12:07,250 --> 05:12:07,549
see.

5037
05:12:07,650 --> 05:12:11,150
Okay, because I feel like we just we just comprehended the

5038
05:12:11,150 --> 05:12:11,650
game.

5039
05:12:13,299 --> 05:12:15,400
I feel like we could beat the next stage first try.

5040
05:12:16,459 --> 05:12:20,819
Okay, let's do it.

5041
05:12:29,380 --> 05:12:32,680
Well, yeah, I knew I'd like Orcs Must Die a lot but I'm as

5042
05:12:32,779 --> 05:12:33,979
the difficulty ran.

5043
05:12:35,619 --> 05:12:37,919
I'm remembering why I like it a lot, you know porn with

5044
05:12:37,919 --> 05:12:39,819
innate magical ability like Warwick.

5045
05:12:39,819 --> 05:12:40,720
Oh, this is this is fun.

5046
05:12:41,119 --> 05:12:43,419
This is great childhood curing.

5047
05:12:43,419 --> 05:12:44,520
Your mother's fever.

5048
05:12:44,520 --> 05:12:47,419
This is um the family cat down from a tree.

5049
05:12:48,020 --> 05:12:52,819
I remember and yeah stuff when I was around just good time

5050
05:12:52,819 --> 05:12:53,520
and luck, right?

5051
05:12:53,619 --> 05:12:56,520
This one seems it's not equally as complicated.

5052
05:12:58,319 --> 05:12:59,020
For you.

5053
05:12:59,220 --> 05:13:00,919
It just happens.

5054
05:13:01,020 --> 05:13:02,020
There's two doors.

5055
05:13:02,720 --> 05:13:07,020
Oh, I got I got a laser section right here.

5056
05:13:09,779 --> 05:13:11,680
Okay, we got teleporters as well.

5057
05:13:13,369 --> 05:13:15,470
Okay, maybe we don't beat it first try just because it's

5058
05:13:15,470 --> 05:13:16,270
confusing.

5059
05:13:22,869 --> 05:13:24,069
Oh shit, they're not long enough.

5060
05:13:32,130 --> 05:13:40,939
Okay, right about I effectively put him at an angle.

5061
05:13:43,069 --> 05:13:45,869
I guess I could go like this and then like that I could

5062
05:13:45,869 --> 05:13:46,569
stagger it up.

5063
05:13:47,470 --> 05:13:50,770
I think ultimately they all are going to have to come down

5064
05:13:50,770 --> 05:13:51,770
this main bridge.

5065
05:13:52,069 --> 05:13:52,470
Yeah.

5066
05:13:53,169 --> 05:13:55,069
Even if they come from other ways, let's start at the

5067
05:13:55,069 --> 05:13:55,569
bridge.

5068
05:13:56,540 --> 05:14:01,610
They think I should put some of my stuff right here right

5069
05:14:01,610 --> 05:14:04,110
like in front of is this the only this is the only way

5070
05:14:04,110 --> 05:14:05,909
they can come up is that there's no other way they can

5071
05:14:05,909 --> 05:14:06,310
get up here.

5072
05:14:07,430 --> 05:14:09,830
It there's there's two ways up.

5073
05:14:10,439 --> 05:14:13,430
What are they going to have to cross that bridge those

5074
05:14:13,430 --> 05:14:15,029
stairs go up to like a high ground for us.

5075
05:14:15,630 --> 05:14:19,540
Okay, I'm going to laser it up right here.

5076
05:14:27,639 --> 05:14:30,540
Okay, I just clicked like four times and it didn't place

5077
05:14:30,540 --> 05:14:31,139
that was weird.

5078
05:14:31,240 --> 05:14:48,189
I don't know why it's doing that seems like okay, I'm

5079
05:14:48,189 --> 05:14:52,700
just going to collaborate with the laser village was

5080
05:14:52,700 --> 05:14:56,240
this new thing charge wall the new thing we just

5081
05:14:56,240 --> 05:14:56,639
unlocked.

5082
05:14:58,159 --> 05:14:58,959
Oh, I don't know.

5083
05:14:59,830 --> 05:15:01,430
It said adult lightning damage.

5084
05:15:02,979 --> 05:15:07,840
That's all I know about that do this thing.

5085
05:15:09,349 --> 05:15:11,950
I'm going to put the next one back here in a moment.

5086
05:15:13,819 --> 05:15:15,119
What's your what's your strategy?

5087
05:15:15,520 --> 05:15:16,520
I have a strategy.

5088
05:15:16,520 --> 05:15:17,119
Where does this go?

5089
05:15:17,119 --> 05:15:21,919
I am walling this off right here in the front and then

5090
05:15:21,919 --> 05:15:25,020
they're going to have to walk around this narrow side.

5091
05:15:25,419 --> 05:15:29,689
I'm going to put a push wall on that because it goes into

5092
05:15:29,689 --> 05:15:30,590
the death pit.

5093
05:15:30,990 --> 05:15:32,889
Not let's do this.

5094
05:15:35,479 --> 05:15:37,180
My barricades are also metal.

5095
05:15:37,180 --> 05:15:37,479
Now.

5096
05:15:37,479 --> 05:15:38,080
Look at that.

5097
05:15:39,529 --> 05:15:42,130
Enemies are preparing to breach one of our gates.

5098
05:15:42,830 --> 05:15:44,529
They've broken through a gate.

5099
05:15:49,700 --> 05:15:52,900
So now the obits are covered in armor all that armor

5100
05:15:52,900 --> 05:15:54,099
should make them pretty.

5101
05:15:54,099 --> 05:15:58,779
Yeah, they were last time dumb dumb.

5102
05:16:13,409 --> 05:16:14,110
Here he goes.

5103
05:16:17,330 --> 05:16:19,229
That is a great strategy that works great.

5104
05:16:20,900 --> 05:16:22,200
Yeah, they go into the meat grinder.

5105
05:16:28,680 --> 05:16:31,080
It also appears like I'm just they're trying to attack me

5106
05:16:31,080 --> 05:16:32,979
and then I keep hopping back on the thing.

5107
05:16:45,580 --> 05:16:46,380
Oh, they broke it.

5108
05:16:51,380 --> 05:16:52,580
I think I know what happened.

5109
05:17:00,330 --> 05:17:02,430
Didn't work out as well as we wanted to.

5110
05:17:03,849 --> 05:17:07,529
I think I messed it up on purpose or not on purpose.

5111
05:17:09,250 --> 05:17:10,049
Easy money.

5112
05:17:10,150 --> 05:17:11,250
They're not counting.

5113
05:17:11,250 --> 05:17:12,250
They didn't count.

5114
05:17:13,349 --> 05:17:14,750
I used my scroll.

5115
05:17:16,619 --> 05:17:17,619
Oh, that's right.

5116
05:17:17,619 --> 05:17:18,619
These are not counting.

5117
05:17:25,830 --> 05:17:26,130
Damn it.

5118
05:17:27,380 --> 05:17:28,680
Okay, that one counted though.

5119
05:17:29,740 --> 05:17:31,840
Tried to fear but it was too late.

5120
05:17:31,939 --> 05:17:35,439
Okay, I would be down for a quick reset with reset.

5121
05:17:35,939 --> 05:17:40,439
Yeah, cuz I think I made them blow up all my shit.

5122
05:17:41,740 --> 05:17:43,340
But we don't have to okay.

5123
05:17:43,340 --> 05:17:46,639
We did last one then it's like five nights at Freddy's

5124
05:17:46,639 --> 05:17:48,340
maybe kind of baby.

5125
05:17:54,700 --> 05:17:56,599
Five nights at Freddy's.

5126
05:17:56,599 --> 05:17:57,500
What about my money?

5127
05:17:57,900 --> 05:17:58,900
Just refund.

5128
05:17:58,900 --> 05:18:00,700
Just refund the money.

5129
05:18:01,299 --> 05:18:02,900
Everyone's worried about their money.

5130
05:18:04,000 --> 05:18:04,799
Capitalism.

5131
05:18:06,299 --> 05:18:08,400
Grinders, lasers and then walk the middle.

5132
05:18:09,299 --> 05:18:11,000
Oh, I think I know what's happening.

5133
05:18:15,900 --> 05:18:17,700
Here do the lasers here.

5134
05:18:18,799 --> 05:18:21,200
I think if we're standing on the other side of the barricade

5135
05:18:21,599 --> 05:18:23,099
things are going to try and shoot at us

5136
05:18:23,099 --> 05:18:25,099
and it might be why the barricade blew up.

5137
05:18:26,000 --> 05:18:27,099
Okay, lasers here.

5138
05:18:28,540 --> 05:18:33,639
And then we'll like defend this narrow and then I'm doing

5139
05:18:34,639 --> 05:18:35,439
slow here.

5140
05:18:37,450 --> 05:18:38,650
I'll just do a line of slow.

5141
05:18:39,049 --> 05:18:41,950
I will I'll prioritize slow this whole line.

5142
05:18:43,049 --> 05:18:48,319
Okay, let's go for it.

5143
05:18:55,779 --> 05:18:57,380
I can't wait to stop these orcs.

5144
05:18:57,580 --> 05:19:00,779
I just clicked three times and it didn't actually wasn't registering

5145
05:19:00,779 --> 05:19:03,680
this something around my mouth should make them pretty weak

5146
05:19:03,680 --> 05:19:05,080
to lightning attacks.

5147
05:19:06,610 --> 05:19:07,509
I'm missing input.

5148
05:19:36,060 --> 05:19:37,060
They do.

5149
05:19:37,360 --> 05:19:40,360
They're like, hey, they're weak to lightning and then you lightning

5150
05:19:40,360 --> 05:19:41,959
them for one damage.

5151
05:19:43,360 --> 05:19:44,659
Yeah, that kind of really isn't hurt.

5152
05:19:44,659 --> 05:19:45,860
Maybe these are a little weaker.

5153
05:19:48,779 --> 05:19:49,479
I'm sticking with Flynn.

5154
05:19:59,990 --> 05:20:02,290
Oh man, there's so many just floating in here.

5155
05:20:20,619 --> 05:20:22,119
Do a zigzag with the barricade.

5156
05:20:23,840 --> 05:20:24,240
It works.

5157
05:20:24,240 --> 05:20:25,139
Okay, give me money.

5158
05:20:26,400 --> 05:20:27,000
Give me money.

5159
05:20:27,700 --> 05:20:28,299
Look at this.

5160
05:20:28,400 --> 05:20:30,700
There are way too many people in here now.

5161
05:20:32,959 --> 05:20:33,360
Let them in.

5162
05:20:33,360 --> 05:20:33,659
Let them in.

5163
05:20:33,659 --> 05:20:34,060
Let them in.

5164
05:20:34,659 --> 05:20:35,060
They're in.

5165
05:20:35,860 --> 05:20:36,860
Let them in the bridge.

5166
05:20:38,819 --> 05:20:42,020
Never never activated the thing so we could just let them.

5167
05:20:42,319 --> 05:20:46,580
Oh, I hear my PT lay down how long it lasts.

5168
05:20:46,580 --> 05:20:48,380
Oh, nobody got in.

5169
05:20:52,700 --> 05:20:53,700
Nobody got in.

5170
05:20:56,610 --> 05:20:58,909
You want to keep slugging it up the barricade again.

5171
05:20:59,819 --> 05:21:00,819
I want to keep slugging it up.

5172
05:21:01,220 --> 05:21:01,919
We're not lazy.

5173
05:21:04,619 --> 05:21:06,220
He breached another door.

5174
05:21:07,520 --> 05:21:08,720
Don't don't don't build anything.

5175
05:21:08,720 --> 05:21:11,020
I think they're they're coming from the other way.

5176
05:21:11,020 --> 05:21:12,319
So none of that's going to even matter.

5177
05:21:12,419 --> 05:21:25,840
Oh shit cannot put lasers here.

5178
05:21:25,840 --> 05:21:27,939
Unfortunately, so I can't really do very much in this.

5179
05:21:27,939 --> 05:21:29,939
There's you can put them the underpass.

5180
05:21:29,939 --> 05:21:31,040
That's oh, yeah.

5181
05:21:38,060 --> 05:21:38,659
Who got by?

5182
05:21:39,560 --> 05:21:39,860
Huh?

5183
05:21:39,959 --> 05:21:41,959
Oh, a bunch of the little runners got by.

5184
05:21:49,180 --> 05:21:50,880
Oh, this is fucked up.

5185
05:22:00,209 --> 05:22:02,209
It feels like you need a lot of lightning damage.

5186
05:22:02,810 --> 05:22:05,509
That's probably why they gave you the lightning trap right before this.

5187
05:22:07,799 --> 05:22:09,000
What is it around my sword?

5188
05:22:09,000 --> 05:22:10,599
It doesn't feel like it doesn't know.

5189
05:22:12,500 --> 05:22:16,400
I wonder if the blue highlight mean like a shield or a barrier or something.

5190
05:22:17,700 --> 05:22:20,400
Who has on what some of the enemies are highlighted blue.

5191
05:22:20,400 --> 05:22:21,700
Some of them highlighted green.

5192
05:22:22,200 --> 05:22:23,000
I wonder what that means.

5193
05:22:24,930 --> 05:22:32,000
I haven't seen it got bombers coming.

5194
05:22:32,000 --> 05:22:32,700
I shoot them.

5195
05:22:33,799 --> 05:22:35,099
Yeah, they'll they'll die from this.

5196
05:22:54,560 --> 05:22:57,560
I was just jumped into that because there's a bunch of orcs.

5197
05:22:59,459 --> 05:23:01,659
Here's there's a bunch of orcs.

5198
05:23:05,369 --> 05:23:07,169
Oh, I thought we were going to fight.

5199
05:23:07,270 --> 05:23:07,869
Ragged.

5200
05:23:09,459 --> 05:23:11,159
Now there's a bunch of fucking orcs.

5201
05:23:11,659 --> 05:23:12,959
That looks like a lot.

5202
05:23:23,819 --> 05:23:25,720
Brothers, there's so many orcs.

5203
05:23:29,380 --> 05:23:31,580
We got more enemies in the rift.

5204
05:23:32,549 --> 05:23:35,150
Okay, this is really hard.

5205
05:23:35,150 --> 05:23:36,650
Damn, this game is hard.

5206
05:23:36,950 --> 05:23:41,150
I didn't think it would be that big of a difficulty from like normal to hard

5207
05:23:41,150 --> 05:23:43,549
when normal was like we could win every round.

5208
05:23:43,549 --> 05:23:44,150
No effort.

5209
05:23:45,549 --> 05:23:47,049
I mean, that's that's a good thing though.

5210
05:23:47,049 --> 05:23:50,450
That means it's you know, it's you don't just blow through the whole thing.

5211
05:23:52,000 --> 05:23:54,400
Yeah, I think you are right though.

5212
05:23:54,900 --> 05:23:59,400
I think you play through a bunch on normal upgrading a bunch of stuff

5213
05:24:00,000 --> 05:24:03,000
and then we need we need like your options of it.

5214
05:24:03,299 --> 05:24:05,799
Like we don't have we would have to respect every single time

5215
05:24:05,799 --> 05:24:08,099
like by the wall charger upgrade the wall charger.

5216
05:24:08,200 --> 05:24:11,000
Yeah, the lightning thing like six times or whatever.

5217
05:24:13,000 --> 05:24:16,599
Well, sorry believers, but I do have to give you a little bit of a

5218
05:24:17,799 --> 05:24:20,599
we didn't know the level and we didn't know what we were dealing with.

5219
05:24:23,740 --> 05:24:28,080
I know that you should always believe but we didn't know what we were doing.

5220
05:24:28,580 --> 05:24:29,880
What it gave me the middle finger.

5221
05:24:33,669 --> 05:24:39,000
What is this special upgrade as well that items have I was able to do it

5222
05:24:39,000 --> 05:24:43,590
on the jar of ghosts and I don't know why it was just there.

5223
05:24:43,689 --> 05:24:44,389
I could press it.

5224
05:24:47,659 --> 05:24:54,659
I'm not sure why I could because yeah, I imagine that I don't even know

5225
05:24:54,659 --> 05:24:59,659
any of them are just special upgrade for the special enemies.

5226
05:25:02,889 --> 05:25:04,290
It literally tells you why.

5227
05:25:07,060 --> 05:25:07,759
No, it doesn't.

5228
05:25:07,759 --> 05:25:08,360
They're lying.

5229
05:25:08,560 --> 05:25:09,759
I'm talking about a different thing.

5230
05:25:10,060 --> 05:25:13,159
Is it do you have to complete this thing first like fear

5231
05:25:13,259 --> 05:25:14,959
a hundred enemies for instance, like the thing in the middle.

5232
05:25:14,959 --> 05:25:16,259
That's for the unique upgrades.

5233
05:25:16,259 --> 05:25:17,159
Oh, yeah, that's right.

5234
05:25:17,259 --> 05:25:19,259
Then the special upgrade is just an X.

5235
05:25:19,459 --> 05:25:21,360
It doesn't have like an explanation.

5236
05:25:22,849 --> 05:25:25,950
Yeah, I don't know what I did but I unlocked it for the jar of ghosts.

5237
05:25:25,950 --> 05:25:30,299
I don't know why I think you just unlock it.

5238
05:25:30,299 --> 05:25:30,599
Maybe.

5239
05:25:34,799 --> 05:25:35,200
All right.

5240
05:25:35,200 --> 05:25:36,500
So how are you doing?

5241
05:25:36,700 --> 05:25:38,500
Are you how you feel feel?

5242
05:25:38,500 --> 05:25:38,900
All right.

5243
05:25:38,900 --> 05:25:44,470
You feel like you want to is FNAF is FNAF watch along a different night.

5244
05:25:44,470 --> 05:25:47,369
We can do that if you think you have the energy to play it.

5245
05:25:47,470 --> 05:25:51,770
How long is five nights at Friday's because I'm picturing it as

5246
05:25:51,770 --> 05:25:53,669
like like a 20 minute thing.

5247
05:25:54,860 --> 05:25:58,360
I mean, it's it's as long or short as you really want to make it.

5248
05:25:58,360 --> 05:26:00,959
It's probably like do you want to beat it?

5249
05:26:01,159 --> 05:26:04,259
Do you want to be stir the gamer and beat five nights at Freddy's

5250
05:26:04,560 --> 05:26:08,520
is it'll probably take like an hour or two, but if stir the gamer

5251
05:26:08,520 --> 05:26:11,319
does not want to game it could take like two to three hours.

5252
05:26:14,970 --> 05:26:16,770
Let's do it another another night.

5253
05:26:17,169 --> 05:26:17,569
Let's do it.

5254
05:26:17,569 --> 05:26:20,470
Like at the start of the stream another night and this way I also

5255
05:26:20,470 --> 05:26:23,470
like I'm forcing you to play something with me again.

5256
05:26:24,069 --> 05:26:30,540
Okay, he hates otherwise if we do right now, it is going to be

5257
05:26:30,540 --> 05:26:33,540
like a 10 minute like haha or the ghost.

5258
05:26:34,639 --> 05:26:39,540
Yeah, we want to start to be to be really locked in focused not

5259
05:26:39,540 --> 05:26:43,240
after five and a half hours of heavy gaming and then this way

5260
05:26:43,240 --> 05:26:47,840
you also get an additional Jerma stream and this way otherwise

5261
05:26:47,840 --> 05:26:48,939
he would not show up.

5262
05:26:48,939 --> 05:26:51,240
He's going to be making his clannations.

5263
05:26:51,240 --> 05:26:53,639
I'll be making my clay and molding all that.

5264
05:26:53,740 --> 05:26:54,139
Yeah.

5265
05:26:57,490 --> 05:26:57,889
All right.

5266
05:26:57,889 --> 05:26:59,189
So what are you on?

5267
05:26:59,389 --> 05:27:01,490
I'm I'm taking I'm taking some time off.

5268
05:27:02,189 --> 05:27:04,389
Be gone for like four or five days.

5269
05:27:07,400 --> 05:27:14,430
You want to you want to square up and kind of do this on are you

5270
05:27:14,430 --> 05:27:15,930
when you're ready?

5271
05:27:15,930 --> 05:27:18,930
I don't really have anything on my schedule except for Fridays

5272
05:27:18,930 --> 05:27:19,529
and Sundays.

5273
05:27:19,529 --> 05:27:20,430
I do some stuff.

5274
05:27:21,229 --> 05:27:22,729
Otherwise, I'm totally free.

5275
05:27:24,159 --> 05:27:24,560
Okay.

5276
05:27:24,560 --> 05:27:28,759
Yeah, I'll ping you on discord with them with a game plan.

5277
05:27:29,560 --> 05:27:34,209
Okay, but can we play again on the other difficulty you on the

5278
05:27:34,209 --> 05:27:36,009
way you like you want to play on the normal difficulty right

5279
05:27:36,009 --> 05:27:36,310
now?

5280
05:27:36,409 --> 05:27:36,810
Yeah.

5281
05:27:37,009 --> 05:27:37,409
Yeah.

5282
05:27:38,080 --> 05:27:39,279
Yeah, we do other one more.

5283
05:27:39,779 --> 05:27:41,279
I want to earn some skulls.

5284
05:27:42,500 --> 05:27:42,900
I don't know.

5285
05:27:42,900 --> 05:27:44,700
I'm really enjoying this.

5286
05:27:45,500 --> 05:27:46,500
Yeah, we will play it.

5287
05:27:46,500 --> 05:27:47,000
We do.

5288
05:27:47,299 --> 05:27:48,500
Yeah, that sounds good.

5289
05:27:49,700 --> 05:27:51,500
There was never going to play for now.

5290
05:27:51,700 --> 05:27:52,799
I was dude.

5291
05:27:52,799 --> 05:27:54,930
It's you know what I mean?

5292
05:27:54,930 --> 05:27:55,729
You know what I'm saying?

5293
05:27:57,009 --> 05:27:58,009
No, I know what you said.

5294
05:27:58,310 --> 05:28:00,110
I mean the energy level.

5295
05:28:00,509 --> 05:28:03,310
No, I really do the energy level of the stream.

5296
05:28:03,310 --> 05:28:03,709
Right.

5297
05:28:03,709 --> 05:28:06,509
I want it to be yeah, it's like it's it's a game where you

5298
05:28:06,509 --> 05:28:10,150
need a lot of like there's not much going on.

5299
05:28:10,150 --> 05:28:13,049
I want us to be like in our prime 20 year old.

5300
05:28:13,049 --> 05:28:17,580
I want to get in a time machine go back to 2008 when this

5301
05:28:17,580 --> 05:28:18,380
shit came out.

5302
05:28:20,650 --> 05:28:20,849
Sure.

5303
05:28:20,849 --> 05:28:23,950
I was building up now that it's going to be like the greatest

5304
05:28:24,150 --> 05:28:25,849
content I've ever produced.

5305
05:28:27,810 --> 05:28:28,610
No, you're good.

5306
05:28:29,650 --> 05:28:30,650
It's kind of a big deal.

5307
05:28:30,650 --> 05:28:35,060
It's kind of like, you know, well, it would be when you're

5308
05:28:35,060 --> 05:28:37,860
at peak energy levels, then it'll be it'll be more fun.

5309
05:28:38,560 --> 05:28:39,659
That's what matters.

5310
05:28:40,319 --> 05:28:44,290
Okay, so what we're on the same level is on the regular

5311
05:28:44,290 --> 05:28:44,990
difficulty.

5312
05:28:45,950 --> 05:28:49,250
Do we want to rethink a strategy here or just kind of

5313
05:28:49,250 --> 05:28:49,549
go?

5314
05:28:49,549 --> 05:28:51,750
I think on regular difficulty we can just we should be

5315
05:28:51,750 --> 05:28:51,950
fine.

5316
05:28:51,950 --> 05:28:52,650
You can just go.

5317
05:28:52,849 --> 05:28:54,450
Yeah, we were doing what we're doing.

5318
05:28:54,450 --> 05:28:55,450
I think would be okay.

5319
05:28:55,959 --> 05:28:59,159
All right, I'll do I'm going to take the there's also you

5320
05:28:59,159 --> 05:29:02,389
got to do like these special challenges and stuff thing.

5321
05:29:02,389 --> 05:29:06,590
You said like I want to want to try the wind belt and

5322
05:29:06,590 --> 05:29:07,290
push them off.

5323
05:29:07,290 --> 05:29:10,790
You don't remember your childhood during your mother's

5324
05:29:10,790 --> 05:29:14,189
fever teleporting the family cat down from are you sure

5325
05:29:14,290 --> 05:29:14,990
you sound upset?

5326
05:29:15,090 --> 05:29:16,790
Remember, yes.

5327
05:29:16,889 --> 05:29:19,189
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

5328
05:29:19,490 --> 05:29:24,580
you sound like I just I just ruined your night to use

5329
05:29:24,580 --> 05:29:24,979
magic.

5330
05:29:24,979 --> 05:29:25,479
Hey, thank you.

5331
05:29:25,479 --> 05:29:25,880
Sorry.

5332
05:29:25,880 --> 05:29:27,479
Thanks for ruining my night.

5333
05:29:27,779 --> 05:29:30,580
We were all waiting for now you have work to do.

5334
05:29:31,250 --> 05:29:35,020
I completely understand and plus we're having fun playing

5335
05:29:35,020 --> 05:29:38,220
this so we are what's the difference usually what to

5336
05:29:38,220 --> 05:29:38,419
see?

5337
05:29:38,419 --> 05:29:40,419
That's the thing usually when I suggest the game to you

5338
05:29:41,819 --> 05:29:46,220
you hate it and we only play for like 20 minutes but I

5339
05:29:46,220 --> 05:29:54,150
like you're enjoying this a lot hmm yeah i mean not everything i don't i don't think there's been

5340
05:29:54,150 --> 05:30:01,299
a game that i genuinely didn't like i could pick one you could do one oh i thought you meant like

5341
05:30:01,299 --> 05:30:09,270
oh yeah i know when you didn't oh oh i don't know you're a good sport you just brought me under the

5342
05:30:09,270 --> 05:30:15,349
bus what is it you're a good sport all right so i'm just gonna put lasers in random places here

5343
05:30:15,349 --> 05:30:22,790
okay i did the same thing i'm ready we're doing the same strategy i'm gonna go like this okay

5344
05:30:24,119 --> 05:30:29,959
but now the enemies will like die oh keep in mind if you're betting this is on normal so i mean we

5345
05:30:29,959 --> 05:30:34,919
could screw this whole thing up that's true there are eight waves preparing to breach one of our gates

5346
05:30:35,720 --> 05:30:42,119
there's armored men all that armor should make them pretty weak to lightning attacks

5347
05:30:55,750 --> 05:31:02,970
dude enemies are dying when i shoot them yeah you probably shouldn't have bet against us if you did

5348
05:31:02,970 --> 05:31:08,860
i mean i'm that's probably that's probably not a great idea let's see what what a lot of people

5349
05:31:08,860 --> 05:31:11,819
probably did is they knew that everyone was going to be betting like of course they're on normal

5350
05:31:11,819 --> 05:31:16,700
they're going to win and they put in like every dollar they they have in their pocket on you know

5351
05:31:16,700 --> 05:31:22,220
on red at the relay table they're just like all i could i've not read sorry on my channel on zero

5352
05:31:23,560 --> 05:31:29,080
that it's like whenever there's like oh 80 percent yes this is going to happen 90 percent like oh i

5353
05:31:29,080 --> 05:31:33,400
want to bet on the opposite for the odds we realize the odds are that way because you're going to like

5354
05:31:33,400 --> 05:31:37,720
you're going to lose your money even if you only put a little bit because the odds you're still

5355
05:31:38,680 --> 05:31:45,319
losing your money well we this is not going that smoothly so far so i'd say that it is

5356
05:31:48,939 --> 05:31:57,740
i'd say that there is no way we're gonna lose okay yeah i just i went i just got three times

5357
05:31:57,740 --> 05:32:02,860
to get that out there i'm gonna complain about this all the whole night oh yeah we get to pause we

5358
05:32:02,860 --> 05:32:07,020
get like our take our sweet time now they're coming from the other way if you want to set up the lasers

5359
05:32:07,990 --> 05:32:15,110
time to throw no i'm prioritizing the tar i feel like that's the best thing to do

5360
05:32:15,830 --> 05:32:23,099
why would you put a barricade right in the middle

5361
05:32:25,259 --> 05:32:32,119
into the easy better oh shit i'm so sorry and then you can set up lasers like after that when

5362
05:32:32,119 --> 05:32:36,360
they're all in the ground and stuff you want to put a laser just like right above that just like

5363
05:32:36,439 --> 05:32:40,040
wham and wham yeah you got it because they're they're gonna get all jammed up on that

5364
05:32:54,279 --> 05:33:11,900
enemies are attacking on another front they've breached another door the barricade is under

5365
05:33:11,900 --> 05:33:17,139
attack the barricade let's go put archers like in the final room oh they they really

5366
05:33:19,139 --> 05:33:34,299
see they they knew it was they knew it was a threat they are wait people are getting

5367
05:33:34,299 --> 05:33:40,680
by some who got by yeah the the little tiny rats i'm gonna i'm gonna go put archers back there so

5368
05:33:40,680 --> 05:33:57,299
that they catch the stragglers are they coming from both sides now yes more enemies all the way

5369
05:34:13,560 --> 05:34:16,919
fear is really great with the lasers because the big some just walk through them like four times

5370
05:34:17,720 --> 05:34:28,500
pretty funny if we lost you want to lose as a joke charlotte it would be um unfortunate to

5371
05:34:28,500 --> 05:34:39,849
all the people that believe in us yeah but like how many people really is that two three million i

5372
05:34:39,849 --> 05:35:09,779
think put it down come on what the hell good freeze good freeze right right in the zapper

5373
05:35:10,340 --> 05:35:16,299
what is that purple that keeps going on that you're doing is that the fear or something else

5374
05:35:16,299 --> 05:35:26,040
uh the purple i'm putting down is an aoe and then the green is the fear all right i think i'm gonna

5375
05:35:26,040 --> 05:35:38,709
goop i'm gonna do some goop start a goop spot right here probably right so they can slowly go

5376
05:35:38,709 --> 05:35:58,380
into your things oh yeah i'm ready i think okay boop i will stay down here all right i'm gonna i'm

5377
05:35:58,380 --> 05:36:10,490
gonna do the other one because i have the wind thing to push them off from the high ground is

5378
05:36:10,490 --> 05:36:21,799
he sleepy um no we're just he is how did i point behind me like you were here and i'm behind you

5379
05:36:21,799 --> 05:36:27,319
yeah ah he is yeah that guy over there oh they're all coming from up here we got nobody

5380
05:36:48,900 --> 05:37:09,349
head come on here they go i'm like perma stunned oh you're dead oh yeah which might have been for

5381
05:37:09,349 --> 05:37:42,169
the best to hold them there longer i miss that guy so many times it's embarrassing good uh i'm

5382
05:37:42,169 --> 05:37:53,590
gonna continue uh the goop it's one of my favorite things about you uh i want yeah i'm gonna go down

5383
05:37:53,590 --> 05:38:14,680
here put it down excuse me game i clicked a hundred times sorry it's like kind of late

5384
05:38:14,680 --> 05:38:25,540
to be going i'm screaming wait come up you're only supposed to click once i know but when i

5385
05:38:25,540 --> 05:38:31,130
click once and it doesn't go twice it doesn't go and then and then it finally goes i wonder

5386
05:38:31,130 --> 05:38:48,459
what why is that happening that wasn't happening earlier the computer's overheating oh good look

5387
05:38:48,459 --> 05:39:22,549
at that breeze big big huge get that skull you wanted to collect skulls look i'm getting it

5388
05:39:23,349 --> 05:39:32,729
hey i want to share it no talk to me when you've earned one one day i will

5389
05:39:35,220 --> 05:39:59,500
one day i might even surpass you okay you can't keep up can't keep up i'm too fast

5390
05:39:59,500 --> 05:40:04,700
looks pretty even so i guess just stay there wave six out of eight that went quick

5391
05:40:05,340 --> 05:40:52,259
i need a bigger tower oh shit you're right yeah no i'm good try to try the game we got we got

5392
05:40:52,259 --> 05:40:58,630
some problems too many orcs too many orcs oh there really are too many orcs

5393
05:41:12,119 --> 05:41:16,919
uh i'm gonna do we lose money if we let them get in and i do the protection thing

5394
05:41:18,599 --> 05:41:22,279
i don't think so i think you just get money for killing stuff

5395
05:41:24,020 --> 05:41:31,000
yeah so don't we technically lose okay well he got it i know you want those skulls but

5396
05:41:32,599 --> 05:41:39,939
be harder all right we don't have any time really here i'm gonna start gooping here

5397
05:41:41,750 --> 05:42:11,939
okay i like i like freezing them in the zap zone it's very good stop

5398
05:42:11,939 --> 05:42:19,529
pooping here comes the collapse why can we get a little bit more goop i i'm out of um

5399
05:42:19,529 --> 05:42:25,540
hey can we get some more goop i'm out of money here comes the collapse why don't let them win

5400
05:42:25,540 --> 05:43:01,340
don't let don't prove that person wrong there totally was a mana potion right i want to get

5401
05:43:01,340 --> 05:43:09,900
that and upgrade that and just be guy who uses mana a lot i feel like that's very useful like

5402
05:43:09,900 --> 05:43:14,779
the wind thing you can just keep spamming it so once they get over here i just keep clicking it

5403
05:43:14,779 --> 05:43:46,759
but it takes mana this is it this one's for all the marbles i believe you you're welcome

5404
05:43:47,830 --> 05:43:54,970
what has healed you oh thank you you know guys he has not even noticed that i've been healing his

5405
05:43:54,970 --> 05:44:02,009

5406
05:44:02,889 --> 05:44:34,229
in me the whole time me barry got some uh work getting in the end the this is clear for now

5413
05:45:42,360 --> 05:45:59,259

5414
05:45:59,259 --> 05:46:08,389
special upgrade is is what's going on i want to try something different i'm doing a refund here

oh do you refund it yeah yeah the things that you buy do not get refunded what do you mean

5417
05:46:25,400 --> 05:46:31,479
it's like if you buy yeah it's it's refunding the upgrades not the purchases of specific things

only for some missions i think they're just i mean it's a one of them's a gigantic catapult that i

5425
05:47:50,759 --> 05:48:05,700
feel like it's kind of overpowered anywhere else uh you good he asks am i good i mean do you want me

5426
05:48:06,180 --> 05:48:23,560
you want to yeah do you want to first continue yeah got a new loadout don't check it out we'll

5427
05:48:23,560 --> 05:48:28,680
watch you no matter what because if you're not having fun we aren't having fun stream for now

5428
05:48:32,389 --> 05:48:39,939
oh look at this place wow we're at the world's edge oh shit it's one of these levels history here

5429
05:48:39,939 --> 05:48:45,799
are we here we're apprentices we just deal with the smoke attacks we got like a stoke top in the

5430
05:48:45,799 --> 05:48:51,479
middle here you must face a slightly bigger problem but you will have it's in the middle

5431
05:48:51,479 --> 05:48:57,740
yeah this is normal we're playing on normal again not on her okay we got this only slightly bigger

5432
05:48:57,740 --> 05:49:11,700
where the heck's the red could it be lois maybe hammer poison oh i didn't i don't have this anymore

5433
05:49:11,700 --> 05:49:19,180
okay you go in the middle and it's a giant castle with a hundred stairs and i think it's all the

5434
05:49:19,180 --> 05:49:31,180
way at the top lasers was a great choice here yeah it's all the way at the top you can take

5435
05:49:31,180 --> 05:49:40,939
the lasers on babe and then there's a teleport all the way up to the top i guess it is a spot for it

5436
05:49:40,939 --> 05:49:51,319
in here yeah jesus this is elaborate you know there's other entrances too that by like i feel

5437
05:49:51,319 --> 05:49:58,619
like you should just build in the middle not care about yeah although if they can come from two

5438
05:49:58,619 --> 05:50:01,819
different it looks like a multiple different directions this might get overwhelming really

5439
05:50:01,819 --> 05:50:10,889
quickly yeah maybe so where is they come up through these areas here no where do they actually come

5440
05:50:10,889 --> 05:50:21,209
up to the rift oh wait no there are only two risks i was i'm wrong hmm i was looking at the

5441
05:50:21,209 --> 05:50:25,369
green doors there's only the two rifts so it's just two sides you take one side i take one side

5442
05:50:25,369 --> 05:50:37,700
probably all right so i guess i'll just be at the top we're gonna have to play some of this stuff

5443
05:50:38,099 --> 05:50:48,840
what is this new thing this big like range this gas range the grill uh they just walk over the

5444
05:50:48,840 --> 05:51:00,520
grill i guess well let me read it snow blower triggers snow blast that damages and freezes

5445
05:51:00,520 --> 05:51:09,880
enemies hmm i kind of like that i'm putting that out putting that yeah you you you take

5446
05:51:09,880 --> 05:51:13,080
care of your side i'll take care of mine i'm taking care of my side

5447
05:51:29,779 --> 05:51:49,610
okay i'm ready ready to go if you fail your side

5448
05:51:51,209 --> 05:52:01,610
i'm gonna be mad um this could work very well or this might be very bad i don't know

5449
05:52:02,330 --> 05:52:09,049
i gotta put my my i gotta put the butterflies down i will i have a strategy those of you that

5450
05:52:09,049 --> 05:52:19,479
are question marking i do have a strategy sorceress i'm worried i have not seen before

5451
05:52:19,479 --> 05:52:25,720
is heading towards us those are fire fields kelsey and they are oh it's only one side right now

5452
05:52:29,029 --> 05:52:34,069
totally immune to fire damage uh too much stuff that i picked up takes mana that was a mistake

5453
05:52:44,869 --> 05:53:04,259
now they're on the other side man that's not cool but my computer crashed mine too

5454
05:53:05,139 --> 05:53:14,459
fuck no i i'm still in the game what happened no i it was era i i got i got annihilated

5455
05:53:16,779 --> 05:53:28,740
i mean my side's going awful mine's going probably worse i would i wasn't even here

5456
05:53:28,740 --> 05:54:01,799
to defend it at the beginning quick get distracted by this

5457
05:54:01,799 --> 05:54:22,099
oh and my computer crashed again that's unfortunate uh here they come uh we're gonna

5458
05:54:22,099 --> 05:54:34,840
we're about to lose are we are we uh i used my scroll oh you did roll and i saved the day

5459
05:54:39,240 --> 05:54:45,939
okay i need to go back enemies at the rift what where where am i where's all my stuff all right

5460
05:54:45,939 --> 05:54:51,779
i don't this level's weird i i kind of just want to build up here okay so when we beat this wave

5461
05:54:52,340 --> 05:55:03,349
i'm gonna get all my money back because this did not work out i agree all right so let's do a new

5462
05:55:03,349 --> 05:55:19,430
strategy here this hammer is kind of a i'm not a huge fan let's put it that way takes mana how is

5463
05:55:19,430 --> 05:55:26,709
that butterfly thing working out i haven't really had a chance to try it so you think we should

5464
05:55:26,709 --> 05:55:35,849
build in the middle honestly yeah well let's go for it you still made it to the next wave

5465
05:55:36,409 --> 05:55:46,279
i mean the stairs this stairs is not a bad idea either but there's a lot of stairs gonna build

5466
05:55:46,279 --> 05:55:53,110
a whole bunch of archer people out here they got a long way to go up these stairs i feel like

5467
05:55:53,110 --> 05:55:57,669
they get this choke point in here and that's like the first time where it's easy to do anything

5468
05:55:57,669 --> 05:56:04,919
about to them because yeah there's this it's really it's the stairs so i mean i'm just gonna

5469
05:56:04,919 --> 05:56:13,909
pick a spot downstairs on my side and just hope it works you know what i'm saying i know what

5470
05:56:13,909 --> 05:56:17,909
you're saying we could block the top somebody's saying and then they'll just have to go around the

5471
05:56:17,909 --> 05:56:23,419
entire other side just put barricades up so they have to literally come all the way up here and

5472
05:56:23,419 --> 05:56:31,459
walk all the way around up to the other side that makes a lot of sense and i blocked my door it's

5473
05:56:31,459 --> 05:56:37,939
just this area here all right in that case i'm gonna i'm gonna do some butterflies let's try it

5474
05:56:37,939 --> 05:57:00,389
i got lasers you know what load that shit up butterflies the optimal spot just keep them here

5475
05:57:00,389 --> 05:57:27,000
keep them sitting right here okay i'm ready this will surprise them put it down no ready up

5476
05:57:27,000 --> 05:57:44,409
i am ready let's do it how would you fight a pack of orcs in real life i would seduce them okay

5477
05:57:46,500 --> 05:57:52,180
i would yeah oh i would fight them with what you'd get destroyed by like a real orc you need some

5478
05:57:52,180 --> 05:57:57,639
sort of like cunning guiler charisma you need to riz them up there's no way you're beating an orc

5479
05:57:57,639 --> 05:58:02,119
in a 1v1 i don't even want to hear it they're like oh weird that you would like i that's the

5480
05:58:02,119 --> 05:58:09,720
only thing i can try i'm gonna kill me i would run thanks for just speaking for me the whole time

5481
05:58:09,720 --> 05:58:20,279
okay i would run a barricade is under attack that's weird that's kind of cowardly at least 25

5482
05:58:21,400 --> 05:58:30,069
all right are you how you doing over there are you good uh i goof oh like they're getting in but

5483
05:58:30,069 --> 05:58:36,060
like who cares oh they're in on your side too okay yeah i thought we were doing a choke point

5484
05:58:36,060 --> 05:58:39,819
on the stairs because we blocked off one of the stairways no i fucked up i didn't block one of

5485
05:58:39,819 --> 05:58:51,380
the stairs oh we'll be fine i blocked the doorway yeah they're going away is there a okay i hope i

5486
05:58:51,380 --> 05:59:06,970
hope we're good here i'll be fine where are you just making shit happen over here they're coming

5487
05:59:12,840 --> 05:59:32,060
yeah um there i need help same i'm okay on my side actually you know we're gonna lose like

5488
05:59:32,060 --> 05:59:45,900
one wave it's fine i need you can look at the map yeah i don't have any control over this

5489
05:59:47,580 --> 05:59:52,220
oh i'm clean over here by the way is that your side i don't know i mean i don't know

5490
05:59:53,500 --> 06:00:02,180
yeah i might i need help on my side bad okay probably need some distracting butterflies

5491
06:00:05,959 --> 06:00:40,389
where are you oh no other stairs oh that hurts emergency riz needed to try try again so do something

5492
06:00:40,389 --> 06:00:51,369
quick um my side's still okay but i need to i have to go defend their cup yeah i believe in you

5493
06:00:52,580 --> 06:00:57,220
it's it's going pretty well over here i got a room full of distracting butterflies and a bunch of

5494
06:00:57,220 --> 06:01:19,000
lasers they're not getting through this all right come back i need more mana like what's wrong with

5495
06:01:19,000 --> 06:01:24,709
that game look dude what the fuck's happening my game why what's happening your game you didn't

5496
06:01:24,709 --> 06:01:42,250
look how am i gonna look at your game i i was flying above you that's cute victory uh where do

5497
06:01:42,250 --> 06:01:48,090
you want the choke point to be like here because i'll give you some lasers i i'm i'll be fine i

5498
06:01:48,090 --> 06:01:54,810
just i spent all my money on nothing and i blocked the door the wrong way well you can have that no

5499
06:01:54,889 --> 06:01:58,090
here's here's i just need to block my stairs so they go up your stairs

5500
06:01:59,900 --> 06:02:04,060
okay yeah that's that's what i'm doing so i am i safe to get rid of all the things i put here

5501
06:02:05,099 --> 06:02:17,020
yeah all right okay and now i need to go find where my useless rows of archers are you have orange

5502
06:02:17,020 --> 06:02:27,049
cream mini twizzlers why does that sound amazing orange cream mini twizzlers that sounds great

5503
06:02:28,900 --> 06:02:46,950
are they not even on my side brother this is okay this is gonna hurt my eyes

5504
06:02:54,020 --> 06:03:00,970
yeah i built all of my archers on your side that that's what we want to do though right

5505
06:03:01,610 --> 06:03:06,180
because theoretically they all should be coming up this way don't even worry about it don't even

5506
06:03:06,180 --> 06:03:16,790
like just say less hey i've already readied up i'm spending i have 10 000 to spend oh my god

5507
06:03:16,790 --> 06:03:45,099
just give me a second just please obama's in the chat hey what's up obama what do you

5508
06:03:45,099 --> 06:03:51,450
what do you got cooking up here i'm calling them in because i i can hear how impatient you are

5509
06:03:51,450 --> 06:03:56,409
no no i just said i was curious what your plan was i'm i'm we're a team you need to tell me

5510
06:03:56,409 --> 06:04:02,330
your plan we're i'm teaming up with you i'm teaming up you want me to put down the you want to put

5511
06:04:02,330 --> 06:04:09,900
down the riz here is what you're saying down here we're gonna rhythm up here did i say it right

5512
06:04:10,779 --> 06:04:30,169
i think so stop that stop stop it right now i don't okay grandpa the old man thinks he's

5513
06:04:30,169 --> 06:04:36,819
hip with the kids but when hold on when stir says it that's okay but you guys don't understand is

5514
06:04:36,819 --> 06:04:47,020
stir is also in his 30s why a lot older than me yeah by not by very much i'm 23 i'm young and

5515
06:04:47,020 --> 06:04:51,990
hip and i it's totally normal for me to go rollerblading doesn't matter how old you are

5516
06:04:51,990 --> 06:05:12,490
you can go rolling that's what i'm saying but i also just happen to be 23 bring him into the

5517
06:05:13,290 --> 06:05:35,500
electricity chamber the gondola of pain this actually does like hurt to look at it i i can't

5518
06:05:35,500 --> 06:05:39,340
tell if the butterflies are good because i i think you're okay i think they're doing something

5519
06:05:39,340 --> 06:05:44,150
decent they open up and they go over there and look at it and they just stare at it for a few

5520
06:05:44,150 --> 06:05:52,340
seconds uh i mean yeah i mean i guess they're in the death zone i really can't look at this

5521
06:05:53,060 --> 06:06:16,330
i know it kind of hurts cast a spell someone for god's sake cast a fucking spell or something

5522
06:06:17,610 --> 06:06:23,799
help yeah i like this where they all come up one tiny simple path and then we win the game

5523
06:06:24,520 --> 06:06:38,169
i don't know if this is killing them no it's just making this take longer

5524
06:06:38,889 --> 06:06:50,659
but i have to do it for the achievement i wonder if it's up that high if it'll still work i think

5525
06:06:50,659 --> 06:07:35,180
so all right boop is down nice i think i'm stalling this wave i apologize uh no this is

5526
06:07:35,819 --> 06:07:39,979
better than losing no i i mean i i keep pushing them off and they don't die and they have to walk

5527
06:07:39,979 --> 06:07:46,220
back up the stairs again yeah but i mean they'll be a trail of them coming up eventually but then

5528
06:07:46,220 --> 06:08:12,150
i push them off again it doesn't loosen uh pull back i gotta heal in 10 seconds oh i couldn't

5529
06:08:12,150 --> 06:08:37,799
heal you what a shame unleash the horde we're ready we go put the snow things down uh if i'm

5530
06:08:37,799 --> 06:08:57,240
gonna push them i should do it here so i didn't level it up you good oh i wanted to sell these i

5531
06:08:57,240 --> 06:09:46,520
guess i can't yeah i'm good i have a strat i need 800 i have to like i'm just gonna look this way

5532
06:09:46,520 --> 06:10:01,700
and just hope they are well i'm winning honestly the blunderbuss or the shotgun or whatever it is

5533
06:10:02,419 --> 06:10:08,250
with points and it is probably unbelievable i haven't touched anything like besides the bow

5534
06:10:08,250 --> 06:10:12,650
and sword and ice it's a shotgun and then it's got a grenade launcher and the grenade launcher it

5535
06:10:12,650 --> 06:10:18,979
just does so much damage it's got a huge blast radius still but no no points and i don't have

5536
06:10:18,979 --> 06:10:28,869
it's not up yet kill me five seconds you're alive i guess i'll heal myself it wasn't up yet

5537
06:10:28,950 --> 06:10:46,819
feel greedy end the stream please scream when i want to end the stream

5538
06:10:48,709 --> 06:11:15,430
i need to go to bed and you scream it's past otto's bedtime true so what was it what was

5539
06:11:15,430 --> 06:11:23,860
the deal with the hammer it kind of stinks maybe with the other upgrades in it is better

5540
06:11:25,590 --> 06:11:29,270
so it's a whirlwind but the whirlwind doesn't really do a whole lot of damage and it takes

5541
06:11:29,270 --> 06:11:37,020
mana to do it it's kind of like other things have such a better secondary it hurt it hits

5542
06:11:37,020 --> 06:12:10,490
for a lot but it's kind of slow too it's okay hope otto's doing good um yeah he's doing great

5543
06:12:11,209 --> 06:12:25,060
i gotta heal for you in three seconds yeah you better i guess you can't get stunned while you

5544
06:12:25,060 --> 06:12:31,139
are in the whirlwind so that's kind of a big deal so the big guys the big deal was that it said it

5545
06:12:31,139 --> 06:12:40,040
knocked things away it probably does that too have i shit myself yet like once an hour ago

5546
06:12:40,040 --> 06:12:54,200
but only a little bit yeah i mean you okay though what's a little shit between friends

5547
06:12:56,569 --> 06:13:05,639
i didn't say anything there's a sprint button all right is that is that as bad as me not knowing

5548
06:13:05,639 --> 06:13:14,299
that you could headshot people have you been sprinting no so you didn't you didn't know that

5549
06:13:14,299 --> 06:13:22,470
either yeah but you had at least you had something too oh that's at least you had something too

5550
06:13:22,470 --> 06:13:30,439
what we never pressed shift wait so fast hold on we've just been we've been we've been like

5551
06:13:30,439 --> 06:13:45,060
diablo 2 walking yeah wow i can't believe we didn't press the button i was really like this

5552
06:13:45,060 --> 06:13:50,580
level takes so long to walk around is it is it does it use manna or stint no you can just

5553
06:13:50,580 --> 06:13:57,400
sprint forever man you really can technology these days six almost six and a half hours and

5554
06:13:57,400 --> 06:14:03,240
we we pressed ship for the first time in six and a half hours that's incredible you even

5555
06:14:03,240 --> 06:14:08,200
remember what button it was yeah it told us that in the very beginning that's so weird that both

5556
06:14:08,200 --> 06:14:14,919
of us didn't do it once why self-imposed that's crazy i can't believe we did that

5557
06:14:19,080 --> 06:14:32,250
well hey well we made it this far apparently you don't need it one time six hours of rp walking i

5558
06:14:32,250 --> 06:14:58,970
know what are we doing the older games had a sprint i know for sure and i've done it we have

5559
06:14:58,970 --> 06:15:04,250
to be the only sorry motherfuckers in this whole world that have honestly a developer probably can

5560
06:15:04,250 --> 06:15:09,290
like oh let's take a look at the game analytics and see these two clowns have not hit the sprint

5561
06:15:09,290 --> 06:15:15,849
button for the entire time they've and i'm not even talking once go through this whole vod i

5562
06:15:15,849 --> 06:15:23,380
have not sprinted once ever not one time i got to go kill this special guy no i mean like to

5563
06:15:23,380 --> 06:15:28,099
realize i could do it a second ago i pressed it once like shift by accident and my character

5564
06:15:28,099 --> 06:15:35,220
moved weird i was like what was that you and i just created a game development study on hold on why

5565
06:15:35,220 --> 06:15:44,759
was that why did they do that a customer did that why fast for some reason why where where

5566
06:15:44,759 --> 06:15:50,680
is this guy who's destroying everything um this is there i think they're going up i think they

5567
06:15:50,680 --> 06:15:57,180
broke what no they didn't know everything's good everything's good my like stomach just might um

5568
06:15:57,180 --> 06:16:03,750
this is also why like in game development you make things like excessively easy and you you get the

5569
06:16:03,830 --> 06:16:08,310
zelda games where you have the characters hand holding you that everyone hates well like we

5570
06:16:08,310 --> 06:16:13,830
we're the reason we were contributing to that we are actually the reason why the game freezes

5571
06:16:14,549 --> 06:16:19,830
and says hey press the sprint button right now or you cannot go to the next screen

5572
06:16:20,869 --> 06:16:28,200
it's pretty incredible we beat that hard hard level we beat that hard ass level without sprinting

5573
06:16:28,200 --> 06:16:34,840
once we that's an achievement that's unbelievable i can't i actually cannot fucking believe that

5574
06:16:48,500 --> 06:16:53,220
we're wondering why it was so hard man this game is so hard we would like running around

5575
06:16:53,220 --> 06:16:57,459
this level because of how big it was it feels so big and empty and there's no way to get around

5576
06:16:57,459 --> 06:17:02,180
quickly i didn't like it i was like this is kind of awkward it's a good thing we can we can lock

5577
06:17:02,180 --> 06:17:06,819
up that one door you guys are going to walk so much we're the reason why the resident evil

5578
06:17:06,819 --> 06:17:13,860
barrels are bright yellow no that's because of how the contrast is different in no it's real no

5579
06:17:13,860 --> 06:17:21,430
there's a real reason for that i don't did you play reasoning before i did not did you ever play

5580
06:17:21,430 --> 06:17:31,000
any of the resident evil games i played resident evil one those are great i feel like you would

5581
06:17:31,000 --> 06:17:37,720
i've i've watched them be played and i enjoy watching them but i just i don't if the moment

5582
06:17:37,720 --> 06:17:43,930
a puzzle shows up i'm gonna quit i'd rather just watch it like the moment i have to match like

5583
06:17:44,889 --> 06:17:52,709
a green gem red gem and a blue gem what ordered like i'm out i'm just you know what it's fair

5584
06:17:53,430 --> 06:17:58,709
well when you get there just hand it to me and i'll i'll do it for you i'm pretty good at this

5585
06:17:58,709 --> 06:18:07,849
that's a good two-star mission we got the thing that i want it scramble unlocked what is scramble

5586
06:18:08,490 --> 06:18:21,669
i don't know i want to say site it what is find out reduce damage while spinning first

5587
06:18:21,750 --> 06:18:25,509
move speed while spinning i'm not a big fan of the hammer i really don't like it

5588
06:18:28,150 --> 06:18:34,549
all right dude i'm gonna get going really yeah i'm getting tired really

5589
06:18:36,139 --> 06:18:42,330
okay are you still swimming uh i would feel weird playing orcs must die without you now

5590
06:18:42,970 --> 06:18:47,610
i'm gonna go to bed it's late for me you know i'm i'm an early i'm an early sleeper you got me out

5591

5593
06:19:06,840 --> 06:19:13,939

5595
06:19:17,860 --> 06:19:23,049
play five nights at freddy's yeah that's disgusting they'd be an uproar there would

5596
06:19:23,049 --> 06:19:27,299
you'd look over a chat and be like when is he playing five nights at freddy's five nights at

5597
06:19:27,299 --> 06:19:34,869
freddy's question mark question mark question mark yeah yeah well it's game over well we'll

5598
06:19:34,869 --> 06:19:38,840
figure out when to do it but that was a lot of fun that i actually had a really good time

5599
06:19:38,840 --> 06:19:44,889
yeah same that's a great game maybe we'd play it again maybe hey maybe we maybe we'd play this

5600
06:19:44,889 --> 06:19:48,970
before five nights at freddy's again and just play this for six or seven hours again and not

5601
06:19:48,970 --> 06:19:53,369
play five nights at freddy's for a second time in a row it's two dlcs to the game as well i

5602
06:19:53,369 --> 06:20:01,020
heard one of them was bad but one of them's good so a lot of content anyway bye i'm gonna let you go

5605
06:20:22,779 --> 06:20:29,689
that was a good time thanks for watching because that is going to be it how many levels are there

5606
06:20:29,689 --> 06:20:47,139
in this game in the base game 18 and then this dlc we got pretty far then we're almost near the

5607
06:20:47,139 --> 06:20:57,259
end if that's the case yeah i will see you guys later i'm gonna take a break for a while uh

5608
06:20:57,259 --> 06:21:00,939
probably like four or five days actually the next time you see me it might just be five nights

5609
06:21:00,939 --> 06:21:13,159
at freddy's mister imagining that might happen oh not brb what am i doing i want to reiterate one

5610
06:21:13,159 --> 06:21:18,819
more time get back out of here i want to say this one more time because i don't know how

5611
06:21:18,819 --> 06:21:22,900
many people trickled in during the stream but at the very beginning i want to say the thing that

5612
06:21:22,900 --> 06:21:30,599
i said before uh if you have if you were part of the presale and you bought a grotto beast

5613
06:21:30,599 --> 06:21:36,709
and you had a march estimated ship date represent is going to be in contact they're going to be

5614
06:21:36,709 --> 06:21:43,479
sending out an email tomorrow there was a shipping problem that they had it was an error or whatever

5615
06:21:43,479 --> 06:21:51,849
it was um i mean obviously no but there's going to be an explanation and we're going to be as

5616
06:21:52,090 --> 06:22:00,229
soon as humanly possible putting a shitload of resource into it um expediting as fast as we can

5617
06:22:00,229 --> 06:22:06,970
the march estimated orders uh we're all very aware of what's going on over there

5618
06:22:06,970 --> 06:22:14,860
and if you were part of the march estimated ship date you're going to get an email tomorrow um

5619
06:22:14,860 --> 06:22:20,729
explaining sort of the next steps if there were two estimated ship dates i'm sure you probably know

5620
06:22:20,729 --> 06:22:25,610
there was a may somewhere mid to late may was an estimated ship date if you are one of these people

5621
06:22:25,610 --> 06:22:31,130
that was affected by this you are not going to have to wait until may you're not going to have

5622
06:22:31,130 --> 06:22:37,560
to wait until the end of may these people these early orders that had some kind of problem with

5623
06:22:37,560 --> 06:22:44,299
the shipping with the the error whatever happened with represent they're going to tell you and

5624
06:22:44,299 --> 06:22:55,509
we're going to go from there we're going to expedite those orders first that's what's going

5625
06:22:55,509 --> 06:23:00,860
to happen you're going to get your order it's not a may estimated ship date i've seen that question

5626
06:23:00,860 --> 06:23:06,069
pop up a lot obviously it's been pretty frustrating it's been pretty stressful um that's something i

5627
06:23:06,069 --> 06:23:14,380
did not want to have happen but it did it did and represent is going to is going to figure it out

5628
06:23:14,380 --> 06:23:28,069
and fix it so that's all we know that's what we're going on who is he talking to come on dude and

5629
06:23:28,069 --> 06:23:34,549
again thankfully the amount of these early orders that have not been fulfilled yet it is a manageable

5630
06:23:34,549 --> 06:23:45,509
amount of orders so we can expedite this process and make sure that you get product so it'll all

5631
06:23:45,509 --> 06:23:51,080
be explained in an email that you'll get from represent tomorrow it's frustrating and i'm

5632
06:23:51,080 --> 06:23:55,930
obviously pretty upset about it but it is what it is we're doing everything we can to make sure that

5633
06:23:55,930 --> 06:24:01,049
whoever is part of this group in march for the march estimated orders they get it as soon as

5634
06:24:01,049 --> 06:24:12,819
fucking humanly possible as soon as possible so just keep an eye on your email and we'll go from

5635
06:24:12,819 --> 06:24:23,689
there i'm so confused all you need to know the march estimated orders there was an error on

5636
06:24:23,689 --> 06:24:30,180
represents front where they were fulfilling orders in the wrong order is essentially how it played

5637
06:24:30,180 --> 06:24:34,259
out and they're going to explain that to you and we're going to go from there we're going to try

5638
06:24:34,259 --> 06:24:42,810
to make everybody happy trust me when i say this has been the thing that me holly jake and we've

5639
06:24:42,810 --> 06:24:54,950
been we've been on this all day every day for two weeks trying to get this situated but the problem

5640
06:24:55,669 --> 06:25:06,500
everybody's aware of this problem now and it's we're just gonna fix it there you go is your mic

5641
06:25:06,500 --> 06:25:25,619
cutting out wait really shouldn't be oh you're good okay but yeah also if you want to keep up

5642
06:25:25,619 --> 06:25:31,849
to date on a lot of this stuff we uh the whole team has been talking in the grotto beast chat

5643
06:25:31,849 --> 06:25:39,500
that's in the discord we're giving updates there pretty much every few hours as we get them so

5644
06:25:39,500 --> 06:25:50,090
let's uh let's just go from here i'm very confident that we'll get this situated very quickly

5645
06:25:50,169 --> 06:25:57,529
and obviously this is not the way i wanted it to play out but it is manageable enough that we can

5646
06:25:57,529 --> 06:26:03,509
fix it in a relatively short period of time because a lot of people have gotten it already

5647
06:26:03,509 --> 06:26:08,310
and a lot of people have shared wonderful wonderful things all their unboxings and all

5648
06:26:08,310 --> 06:26:13,270
their cards they're getting and it's it's awesome and we're super fucking excited to see people

5649
06:26:13,270 --> 06:26:20,549
um having a good time with it but there are people that were early orders that got sort of

5650
06:26:20,549 --> 06:26:25,590
left out and that does that makes me unhappy so i'm doing everything in my power to make sure

5651
06:26:25,590 --> 06:26:32,939
that that is fixed as soon as fucking humanly possible have a great night uh i'm gonna take a

5652
06:26:32,939 --> 06:26:39,479
little bit of a break not long maybe like four days five days but this whole last two weeks

5653
06:26:39,479 --> 06:26:44,900
i feel like i've been running um essentially in a full sprint uh obviously part of the reason why

5654
06:26:44,900 --> 06:26:49,220
you didn't see me for a while before was getting some other grotto be stuff situated the commercial

5655
06:26:49,220 --> 06:26:52,979
stuff and i think i want to take a little bit of time at least a few days probably three four days

5656
06:26:52,979 --> 06:27:02,470
at least keep an eye on the sus take care of yourselves call your mother thank you for watching

5657
06:27:02,470 --> 06:27:06,790
and again if you know somebody that has a march estimated ship date that is like what where's

5658
06:27:06,790 --> 06:27:16,900
where's my order uh let them know to keep an eye on their email as of tomorrow thanks guys see you

5659
06:27:16,900 --> 06:27:27,819
soon see you in at least three or four days have a great evening have a great night and yeah let's

5660
06:27:27,819 --> 06:27:46,139
fucking go five nights at freddy's coming up soon with sir i'm gonna laugh so hard if we do this again

5661
06:27:47,099 --> 06:27:54,580
and we just play orcs must die it's five nights at freddy watch along with stir going to be the new

5662
06:27:54,580 --> 06:28:04,229
thing that just never happens we just do other stuff every single time it might be all right

5663
06:28:04,229 --> 06:28:08,540
take care of yourselves see you later call your mother better not ready but i'll say it again

5664
