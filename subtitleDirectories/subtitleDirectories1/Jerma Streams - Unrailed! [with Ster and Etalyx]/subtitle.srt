1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:21,370
Alright, hello. Did we lose Ster? Ster's gone. He left. Oh no, he's not, he's here.

2
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:25,370
So for 12 months, way back when when you were allowed to do that as a channel.

3
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:26,570
Are you sticking around?

4
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:34,229
Yeah, I got guilted by my mom. My mom said don't stop playing video games right now.

5
00:00:34,789 --> 00:00:39,109
Keep playing games. And now I have to keep playing games because my mom told me to.

6
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,420
You know what? It's such a... I feel like that could be true.

7
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:50,899
It is. It is 100% true. Okay.

8
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:56,579
My mom and my wife teamed up to guilt me into playing a game.

9
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,700
Because she's just like you, one of her favorite games is House Flipper.

10
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,739
She's put a ton of hours into it. She loves watching the Jerma House Flipper streams.

11
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:15,269
You ask her what her favorite stream or video is of her son, she'll say Jerma's House Flipper.

12
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:19,189
What, what incredible taste. I just have to say, seriously.

13
00:01:19,189 --> 00:01:25,420
And then she says your welcome chat, but it's your, not apostrophe, you are.

14
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,140
She's just...

15
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,340
What about you are?

16
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,579
All right. How do we, how do we play this game?

17
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,060
Are we loading it up right now?

18
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,170
We're going to open it.

19
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,290
You guys don't even know.

20
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:36,890
Hope it's not loud. Hope it's not loud. Hope it's not loud.

21
00:01:37,609 --> 00:01:39,209
Prepare for loud game. Hold on.

22
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:47,930
Oh, I'm going to mute just in case.

23
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:55,739
It might be loud. Star's going to be getting, Star's getting grumpy.

24
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:03,480
What's your favorite food?

25
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,359
Now, like at this point.

26
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:27,379
Yeah. Uh, hold on, hold on, hold on. Um, what is it? Is this a, is this like a joke?

27
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:34,250
No, no, no. Like the, okay, the opening page.

28
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,289
I don't even want to show this.

29
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:41,379
No, it's like a person's phone number.

30
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:49,240
Thank you for playing our early access.

31
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,639
By the way, if you want to like call this person, that's like the CEO of the, wow.

32
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,900
I don't, I, I, this might be fake. Is this part of the game?

33
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,629
No, no. Fuck that.

34
00:03:04,629 --> 00:03:08,340
All right. No. All right. I would still, how do we play together?

35
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:20,650
Start game. Hold on. Progress report a bug. Remove is split input.

36
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:21,849
All right. I'm going to go start game.

37
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:27,500
How do we play this together? Anybody? Do we have any idea?

38
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:35,669
Well, hold on. I think you have to do the tutorial.

39
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:48,629
You'll be all right. You're going to be fine.

40
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,449
See, we've, do you believe that?

41
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:58,120
Well, then that contradicts what you just said.

42
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:07,189
Okay. So I don't know if it's like, no, dude, I'm serious.

43
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:13,000
At talks, it shows like a guy's phone number.

44
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,519
Oh man, guys. Hold on. You guys have been muted this whole time.

45
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,680
I'm so sorry. He's all right.

46
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,839
That's okay. I wasn't even talking.

47
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:26,310
I muted you for most of that time.

48
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:30,389
Okay. Fuck. I was muted the whole time. God damn it.

49
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:33,750
Okay. I'm going to call this guy and I'm going to do that.

50
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,339
Hey, do we have to play the tutorial first?

51
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,259
Yes. Just do it.

52
00:04:42,069 --> 00:04:43,189
No, I'm going to ask him.

53
00:04:44,149 --> 00:04:45,670
Oh my fucking God.

54
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,240
I'm just going to play the game and we'll, we'll kill them in a minute.

55
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,240
To craft new track pieces, you need wood and iron.

56
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,839
Grab region is plus 49.

57
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:57,639
Stop, stop it.

58
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,279
Dude, anyone who wants this can just buy the game.

59
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:11,800
Oh, it's Germany.

60
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:17,259
All right. You have to chop down wood.

61
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,259
What time is it in Germany? It's late.

62
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:25,620
I think we'd, yeah, we're doing the tutorial.

63
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,649
It's too late. I'm not calling them.

64
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:34,100
It's going to go to his answering.

65
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,540
Yeah. It's probably like five 30 there.

66
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,259
He's probably asleep.

67
00:05:36,259 --> 00:05:39,699
No, it's 2 a.m. They're saying, I mean, I'll tell you, you gotta,

68
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:46,819
you gotta have some like iron, iron body to put your personal telephone

69
00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:49,060
number at the splash screen of your video game.

70
00:05:49,939 --> 00:05:54,120
It probably goes to like a Hulk Hogan fake answering machine.

71
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,000
It probably does.

72
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,889
Okay. So what am I doing?

73
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:02,089
What do I do? Start game?

74
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:05,529
But how do we play? I gotta call this guy.

75
00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:06,490
Just do the tutorial.

76
00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:08,810
Is that when you click start game?

77
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,250
Yeah, just yes.

78
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,050
Yes. All right. So you put both.

79
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,870
Holy shit. This is going to be insanely difficult.

80
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,550
Is it?

81
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:29,110
I think so.

82
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,250
Okay. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

83
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:34,540
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

84
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:37,019
This is on Twitch yet.

85
00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:39,100
What's it called? Unrailed.

86
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:42,709
Unrailed. Okay.

87
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:44,310
It is. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

88
00:06:45,269 --> 00:06:47,750
What are we holding up for?

89
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:50,100
Can you do me a favor?

90
00:06:51,269 --> 00:06:51,750
Yeah. What is it?

91
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,870
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

92
00:06:53,589 --> 00:07:01,129
I don't know how to bring that screen back up again.

93
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,610
It doesn't do it if you reopen the game.

94
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:06,170
All right. I'm going to be I want to be the first one to finish the tutorial

95
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:07,610
so I can see how smart I am.

96
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:08,250
I don't think he is.

97
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,339
His phone number lost to me.

98
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:16,009
It really doesn't show it again if you don't.

99
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,490
That's like I don't know how to bring it back up.

100
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:21,240
Oh, I got it.

101
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:26,550
The train overheats over time and will start to burn.

102
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,709
Build a bridge to the bucket and fill it with the river.

103
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:35,899
Nobody tell him.

104
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,060
How the hell are we going to do this together?

105
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,379
We've got like sleepy star on the call.

106
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:43,660
You think he's going to want to do this?

107
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,980
How do I do a plus on the phone?

108
00:07:48,649 --> 00:07:50,649
It says zero is a plus.

109
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:51,449
Done it.

110
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:52,970
Tutorial done. I win.

111
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:54,569
Well, I didn't know.

112
00:07:54,569 --> 00:07:56,089
I'm the smartest gamer.

113
00:07:56,089 --> 00:07:58,009
I didn't even know it was a competition until you said it.

114
00:07:58,009 --> 00:07:59,050
You could have been speed running it.

115
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:11,399
Okay. There we go.

116
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,759
Online game.

117
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:13,259
Yeah.

118
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:15,459
All right. Do we know how this...

119
00:08:15,459 --> 00:08:17,060
Is this just through Steam or what?

120
00:08:18,259 --> 00:08:19,300
That is a good question.

121
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,759
Create private lobby.

122
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,759
Might want to hide your...

123
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,040
What the hell are you doing?

124
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:30,860
Fucked up.

125
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,250
Are you trying to call this person?

126
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,610
That's the way he wrote it.

127
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,529
But then it says that's not how you do it.

128
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,769
You can't call from the United States.

129
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:42,889
You can.

130
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:43,370
Two tur...

131
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:43,929
No, you can't.

132
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,049
You can just sit...

133
00:08:45,049 --> 00:08:46,649
Best case scenario.

134
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:47,690
Best case scenario.

135
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:48,330
He answers.

136
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,450
He goes, hi, how are you?

137
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:52,090
And you go, hi, I'm streaming your game right now.

138
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:52,889
He tunes in.

139
00:08:52,889 --> 00:08:55,690
Then you insult him and like say his game sucks.

140
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:59,129
And you personally call him to like make fun of him.

141
00:08:59,129 --> 00:09:02,649
You have to do like star something something.

142
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:03,690
You can't just call the number.

143
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:04,169
No, no, no.

144
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:06,409
See, because it's plus 49 for Germany.

145
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,490
And then it has parentheses zero.

146
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,529
You gotta do something before that.

147
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:11,769
What it just said is not to do the parentheses zero.

148
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:13,210
But that's the way he wrote it.

149
00:09:14,809 --> 00:09:18,200
Plus that call is going to cost you like $60 a minute.

150
00:09:23,289 --> 00:09:23,769
Guys, I'm...

151
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:24,330
I can't.

152
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,090
I'm making Jerma very uncomfortable.

153
00:09:26,889 --> 00:09:33,539
Like I just wanted to have a conversation about his game with other people.

154
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:36,379
And Jerma said, you know what?

155
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:36,860
I have...

156
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,059
I have a session.

157
00:09:38,059 --> 00:09:39,100
Are you done with the tutorial?

158
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,000
I see.

159
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,799
And it's people like you is why we're never going to find Hillary's emails.

160
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:46,950
What do I do in this tutorial?

161
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,389
Well, I could try moving your character.

162
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:50,309
Oh, you motherfucker.

163
00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:52,789
I was calling him.

164
00:09:52,789 --> 00:09:53,350
I was busy.

165
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:58,470
You were trying to call a person that you don't know's random telephone number

166
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,990
for a laugh out loud.

167
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,509
Fucking look what I'm doing on the stream.

168
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:02,870
I'm going to call this guy.

169
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,789
And even moved your character on the screen.

170
00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:07,049
I didn't even...

171
00:10:07,049 --> 00:10:08,009
I just got in the game.

172
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:09,529
Oh, my God.

173
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:09,769
All right.

174
00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:10,809
What are the buttons?

175
00:10:10,809 --> 00:10:12,009
How do I join you?

176
00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:13,370
You have to give me your session ID.

177
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,649
I have a session ID.

178
00:10:15,529 --> 00:10:16,649
I have a session ID.

179
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:17,690
I'm about to give it to you.

180
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:18,889
I'm going to put it into the chat.

181
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:24,490
Star, don't leak this.

182
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:31,509
That's the session ID.

183
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:35,460
He wants people to call him, though.

184
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,179
It's different.

185
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,279
Yeah, if there's like a bug or something, you're just going to...

186
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:43,240
What's the purpose of your call?

187
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:48,470
I was going to ask if we had to do the tutorial before we play together.

188
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:50,149
You're our speakerphone on my stream.

189
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:52,940
Okay.

190
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:54,539
What do you want?

191
00:10:57,419 --> 00:10:57,980
Just hang up.

192
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,899
Do you honestly think that's the worst call he would have ever done?

193
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:02,139
No.

194
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:03,659
Excuse me, sir.

195
00:11:03,659 --> 00:11:05,740
I'm showing interest in your indie game.

196
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,379
I know you worked really hard on it, but I'd rather not talk to you

197
00:11:08,379 --> 00:11:09,740
and not share it with anyone.

198
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,059
Fine.

199
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,860
Tal, do you have 466 ping right now?

200
00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:17,269
Why?

201
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:22,120
Grab some wood.

202
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,000
Jerma, where's the wood?

203
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,480
Why is this ping so high?

204
00:11:25,289 --> 00:11:25,850
The wood...

205
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:26,889
If you chalk down...

206
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:29,929
Have you ever played a video game that's come out in the last 10 years?

207
00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:31,529
You have to get wood from the tree.

208
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:36,100
Is there action we're not seeing?

209
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:36,659
Yeah, there is.

210
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:39,860
But the session ID is on the screen, so I can't show it.

211
00:11:40,419 --> 00:11:41,539
I don't know how to do this.

212
00:11:49,929 --> 00:11:51,129
How do you make the rail?

213
00:11:51,929 --> 00:11:56,389
Oh, wait.

214
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:57,990
Did the Talix show the session ID?

215
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,659
What did that tutorial message just say?

216
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,279
I'm out.

217
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:06,490
I almost got it.

218
00:12:07,129 --> 00:12:08,600
I left the call.

219
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:09,720
Not the call.

220
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,440
I left the lobby.

221
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:14,679
Okay, Star, you have to host this lobby because we're on like...

222
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,200
You have to host this.

223
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,200
My train's on fire.

224
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,039
Yes, go get the bucket.

225
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:23,159
Stand next to the water and let it fill and then walk over to the left and pour it.

226
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,139
Oh, okay.

227
00:12:29,059 --> 00:12:32,259
Remember when you wanted me to play and my mom wanted me to play?

228
00:12:32,259 --> 00:12:33,220
Changing diapers here.

229
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:35,769
Isn't that weird?

230
00:12:40,539 --> 00:12:42,539
Oops, was I muted?

231
00:12:42,539 --> 00:12:43,580
Oh, I was.

232
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,940
You leaked us.

233
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:48,299
I know, but it doesn't matter because he's not even done with the tutorial anyway.

234
00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:52,860
Make sure you put your region to US West, by the way.

235
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,460
I have to do that?

236
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:05,289
Yeah, go to online and then go to region US West and select it.

237
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,620
What if I did Korea?

238
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:15,139
Then it would be very bad because you would be relaying through entire continents.

239
00:13:15,139 --> 00:13:16,580
Okay, how do I join you?

240
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,779
Or do I need to call the guy?

241
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:22,659
You're going to hit a BRB screen or black out your screen.

242
00:13:22,659 --> 00:13:24,259
You're going to go to create private lobby.

243
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:26,539
Okay.

244
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:29,100
There's going to be a seed in the top left.

245
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,940
Don't tell anybody else that seed.

246
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,059
That's just for me to tell us.

247
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,100
Wouldn't it be cool if like a hundred people joined though?

248
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,220
This game can only have like five...

249
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,740
I think there's only four people.

250
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,009
All right, and then you're going to just type into the chat.

251
00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:49,049
Make sure you're US West in your region.

252
00:13:49,049 --> 00:13:52,250
And you're going to type into the discord chat with the three of us in here.

253
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,210
And that five digit seed session ID.

254
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:56,889
Hold on.

255
00:13:56,889 --> 00:13:58,090
My game like froze.

256
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:02,710
What the fuck is happening?

257
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:03,110
Are you...

258
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:06,549
Did you click on session ID and it's got a little cursor and you have to press escape?

259
00:14:08,379 --> 00:14:09,500
I'm focusing.

260
00:14:15,909 --> 00:14:16,309
Okay.

261
00:14:16,309 --> 00:14:17,110
And now I...

262
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:19,429
Do I start the game or do I give this to you first?

263
00:14:19,429 --> 00:14:19,990
Just wait to...

264
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:20,950
Don't hit start yet.

265
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:21,429
Just give...

266
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,389
It is definitely not poo poo.

267
00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:25,269
It's definitely not...

268
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:25,830
That's not the password.

269
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:26,870
That is what it is.

270
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,549
Because I know it's not special.

271
00:14:28,549 --> 00:14:28,950
It is.

272
00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:40,679
Hang on.

273
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:41,320
Are we sure?

274
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,600
I don't know.

275
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:44,600
I don't know if that's real.

276
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,039
I actually had to look on Steam to check to see if he even installed the game.

277
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:49,639
I wondered if this was just a bruise.

278
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:54,809
But yeah, he is in fact in the game on Steam.

279
00:14:54,809 --> 00:14:56,570
He's in his poo poo lobby.

280
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:57,210
Okay.

281
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:57,610
Let's go.

282
00:14:58,970 --> 00:14:59,529
Yeah, we have to...

283
00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:00,409
Is that how that works?

284
00:15:01,129 --> 00:15:02,330
I'm going to join your lobby.

285
00:15:03,129 --> 00:15:03,610
Session ID.

286
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:03,850
Oh, wait.

287
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,610
No, you want session ID?

288
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:05,929
Yes.

289
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,379
You just made a custom seed.

290
00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:12,340
Okay, cool.

291
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,419
I thought I was...

292
00:15:14,419 --> 00:15:16,259
No, make sure you're not showing this to anybody.

293
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:17,700
I'm not.

294
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,259
I'm not.

295
00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:18,980
Why would I do that?

296
00:15:20,179 --> 00:15:21,820
Okay.

297
00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:24,700
I can't get off of the typing.

298
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:26,570
Okay.

299
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:27,370
There we go.

300
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:28,169
Now don't...

301
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:29,529
Game mode.

302
00:15:30,169 --> 00:15:30,730
Difficulty.

303
00:15:33,259 --> 00:15:34,220
Enable checkpoints.

304
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,580
Who would leak such a thing?

305
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,139
Do not allow random players to join.

306
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,340
Are we good?

307
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:40,299
Difficulty?

308
00:15:40,299 --> 00:15:41,259
Don't put it on medium.

309
00:15:41,259 --> 00:15:42,059
Don't put it on hard.

310
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:42,940
There's no way we're going to do that.

311
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,860
We're idiots.

312
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,379
And game mode endless.

313
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:48,460
Why would we not do game mode like normal?

314
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,519
Well, isn't endless the normal?

315
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:53,399
I guess it is normal.

316
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:53,720
All right.

317
00:15:55,129 --> 00:15:58,330
Endless is like see how far you can get before you crash.

318
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:58,809
All right.

319
00:15:58,809 --> 00:15:59,289
You ready?

320
00:15:59,929 --> 00:16:00,330
Let's go.

321
00:16:00,889 --> 00:16:01,929
With checkpoints enabled,

322
00:16:01,929 --> 00:16:05,370
you can restart at the first station in each biome after you crash.

323
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:05,610
All right.

324
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:06,970
Are we ready to start streaming this game?

325
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,649
Do not show up on the leaderboard.

326
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:09,129
Hurry up.

327
00:16:09,129 --> 00:16:09,769
I showed it.

328
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:11,370
So everyone come stand up here.

329
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,330
You have to all stand here.

330
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:13,370
I think I showed it.

331
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:15,129
I definitely showed it.

332
00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:16,409
You showed it.

333
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:17,210
Let's go.

334
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,009
It was an accident.

335
00:16:18,009 --> 00:16:20,009
I thought we were starting.

336
00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:21,129
He showed it.

337
00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:22,009
Okay.

338
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:23,289
Okay.

339
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:25,370
If you guys actually have this game, call that number.

340
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:26,090
Tell me what happened.

341
00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:26,970
Okay.

342
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:27,370
Let's go.

343
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:29,049
We got to kill the creepers.

344
00:16:30,169 --> 00:16:30,889
The Enderman.

345
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:35,129
We got to build a train track and we got to dig a path for it straight ahead.

346
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:36,809
So go directly in front.

347
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:38,409
The train is already moving.

348
00:16:38,409 --> 00:16:39,210
Yeah, it's moving.

349
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:40,009
All right.

350
00:16:40,009 --> 00:16:41,210
We're making train tracks.

351
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:41,370
Yeah.

352
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:42,090
This is endless.

353
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:48,519
This is stressful.

354
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:49,399
All right.

355
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:50,519
So we ain't seen nothing yet.

356
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:54,139
What is this bucket?

357
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:54,779
What's the bucket?

358
00:16:56,059 --> 00:16:58,519
You did the tutorial.

359
00:16:58,519 --> 00:16:59,000
No, I know.

360
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,120
But what's the water?

361
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,240
Water, water, water, water, water, water.

362
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:06,170
I got to make another mine.

363
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:07,450
We need track.

364
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:09,450
We need wood.

365
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:10,490
But there's no footies.

366
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:10,970
Wait, wait, wait.

367
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:11,450
I got to go up.

368
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:13,900
You got to dig up.

369
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,539
Who is this person?

370
00:17:14,539 --> 00:17:15,660
The person is hitting me.

371
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,140
We're dead.

372
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,259
We're dead.

373
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:18,700
All right.

374
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,019
Get out.

375
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:19,500
Get out.

376
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,180
Where is it?

377
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,170
I can't move.

378
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:27,849
You have somebody to break me out.

379
00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:31,480
We got trees.

380
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:35,190
We need that pickaxe so we can actually...

381
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,150
You guys can't get over here.

382
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:36,630
Oh my God.

383
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,509
You just made a turn.

384
00:17:37,509 --> 00:17:38,309
No, no, no, no, no.

385
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:42,180
Okay.

386
00:17:51,579 --> 00:17:52,299
How do we get water?

387
00:17:52,299 --> 00:17:54,299
Water, water, water, water, water, water, water, water, water.

388
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:58,069
We got to get a crossing.

389
00:17:58,069 --> 00:18:00,619
We're killing the creepers.

390
00:18:00,619 --> 00:18:10,660
Where's the pickaxe?

391
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:12,420
I got it.

392
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:14,089
What?

393
00:18:14,089 --> 00:18:15,049
Put wood in the thing.

394
00:18:15,049 --> 00:18:15,769
What?

395
00:18:15,769 --> 00:18:17,289
Put wood in it.

396
00:18:17,289 --> 00:18:18,569
There's no wood.

397
00:18:18,569 --> 00:18:19,529
I'm chopping the trees.

398
00:18:19,529 --> 00:18:20,170
Come get the wood.

399
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,160
All right.

400
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,059
I need one piece of wood to build a bridge.

401
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:30,859
Not a space.

402
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:31,579
No, no, no, no, no.

403
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,539
What is that?

404
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:37,339
Why is this a mini?

405
00:18:37,339 --> 00:18:37,819
How do I...

406
00:18:37,819 --> 00:18:38,380
No, this way.

407
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:38,779
Right here.

408
00:18:40,779 --> 00:18:42,059
This is just grass.

409
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:42,460
Okay.

410
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,420
So we can go over that.

411
00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:45,940
Should we go right?

412
00:18:46,579 --> 00:18:47,380
No, go straight.

413
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,339
I cleared a path already.

414
00:18:48,339 --> 00:18:49,299
It goes all the way up to here.

415
00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:50,900
Oh, okay.

416
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:52,099
Where's the axe?

417
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,380
I got it.

418
00:18:57,319 --> 00:18:58,279
We need more wood.

419
00:18:58,279 --> 00:18:59,240
All right, wood behind me.

420
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,359
Fire, fire.

421
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:01,400
It's about to die.

422
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:01,960
It's over.

423
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,160
It's going to crash, it's going to crash, it's going to crash, crash, crash, crash, crash.

424
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:10,279
Just get the tracks.

425
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:11,559
Uh-oh.

426
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:12,039
I fucked.

427
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:15,240
We can turn it.

428
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:15,640
We can turn it.

429
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,000
No, you can't turn it.

430
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,680
What do you mean you can turn it?

431
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,279
Is this snake advanced?

432
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,759
Where's the axe?

433
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:23,400
Oh, my God.

434
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,039
All right, turn it again.

435
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:25,640
Hang on.

436
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,920
Time, time.

437
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,819
We need more wood.

438
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,299
I'm chopping it down right now.

439
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:39,130
I've got a ton of wood up here.

440
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:44,759
So you got...

441
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,319
Oh, my God.

442
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:50,549
I'm going to chop down every tree over here.

443
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:53,960
Too many cooks in the kitchen.

444
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,920
We're just going to go on a straight line.

445
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,200
Yeah, but we need wood and shit.

446
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,640
I'm just going to be the wood guy.

447
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,680
But you just chop a straight path all the way through and we'll be fine.

448
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,240
But wood.

449
00:20:10,869 --> 00:20:11,589
Where's the bucket?

450
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,119
I'm already splashing.

451
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,400
Okay.

452
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,119
How are we doing?

453
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:16,680
Good.

454
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:16,920
Right.

455
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,680
We need just regular old track.

456
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:21,509
Tons of stone.

457
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:26,680
All right.

458
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,319
That was almost...

459
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:29,079
What can I chop?

460
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:30,759
Over here.

461
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:31,240
It's the right...

462
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:34,500
I'm going to throw up.

463
00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:38,869
Things have kind of calmed down a little.

464
00:20:38,869 --> 00:20:39,509
Yeah, that was good.

465
00:20:39,509 --> 00:20:41,269
That was a little panicky for a minute, but it's all right.

466
00:20:43,269 --> 00:20:53,529
All right.

467
00:20:53,529 --> 00:20:54,890
We got tons of resources.

468
00:20:55,609 --> 00:20:57,049
We have a lot of resources.

469
00:20:57,049 --> 00:20:58,730
Build resources.

470
00:20:58,730 --> 00:20:59,930
Remember back in the day.

471
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:00,730
Yeah.

472
00:21:02,069 --> 00:21:02,309
Good.

473
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,109
Is your track ready?

474
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:08,950
Oh, my God.

475
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,869
You see, it's hard to place.

476
00:21:12,069 --> 00:21:13,670
Actually, that's not a bad idea.

477
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,750
It'll take a long time to get over here.

478
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:18,259
All right.

479
00:21:18,259 --> 00:21:19,460
I'm going to chop down some...

480
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,990
I'm going to get some more stone.

481
00:21:23,019 --> 00:21:24,539
I think we're going to go straight down this way.

482
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:29,259
Why not go...

483
00:21:29,259 --> 00:21:30,539
You got to go to the station.

484
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:31,180
That's what I'm doing.

485
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:32,539
Oh.

486
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:36,279
Well, why not go through the trees and then we get a bunch of wood?

487
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,920
Look at all the wood that's already around all over the place.

488
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,960
We got a fire.

489
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,160
There's tons of wood.

490
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,440
How about we speed this thing up?

491
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:44,519
It probably will when you hit the checkpoint.

492
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:45,720
All right.

493
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,109
We got plenty of resources.

494
00:21:49,109 --> 00:21:49,829
Where's the axe?

495
00:21:49,829 --> 00:21:51,349
I'm going to use it.

496
00:21:51,349 --> 00:21:51,750
Good.

497
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,150
Very good.

498
00:21:52,869 --> 00:22:00,119
Pass game.

499
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,309
Turn your volume down.

500
00:22:04,309 --> 00:22:04,630
All right.

501
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:04,789
Quick.

502
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:06,150
You got to get in front of it.

503
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:06,630
What do I do?

504
00:22:07,349 --> 00:22:07,589
All right.

505
00:22:07,589 --> 00:22:08,069
You're good.

506
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,269
Just it's about to go on the...

507
00:22:13,109 --> 00:22:13,349
On the...

508
00:22:14,069 --> 00:22:14,630
Straight away.

509
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,390
Yeah, we can build bridges, dude.

510
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,150
We need more stone.

511
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:20,950
We need stone.

512
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:21,349
Stone.

513
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,380
Water, wood, no stone.

514
00:22:25,339 --> 00:22:26,380
There's stone on the ground here.

515
00:22:27,509 --> 00:22:28,710
Fucking crybaby.

516
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:29,269
It's raining.

517
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:36,339
Let me introduce you to who is what character.

518
00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:38,180
I'm Penguin.

519
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:38,579
I'm...

520
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:39,859
Cowboy.

521
00:22:40,579 --> 00:22:40,900
You're Indiana Jones.

522
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,660
Snowman.

523
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,779
At the top right of...

524
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:44,819
I don't know what I am.

525
00:22:44,819 --> 00:22:45,380
Stone?

526
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:45,859
Who are you?

527
00:22:45,859 --> 00:22:46,579
Stone man?

528
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:47,859
Skull man?

529
00:22:47,859 --> 00:22:48,740
I think I'm like a man.

530
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,740
Skull skeleton in a suit or something?

531
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,430
I just call me Sans.

532
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:55,509
Remember that game?

533
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:57,619
I played that game.

534
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,299
I did not.

535
00:22:59,299 --> 00:22:59,859
I did not.

536
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,140
I wonder if I...

537
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,180
Can I pause it and...

538
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,460
What if I show the session ID?

539
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:06,819
Uh-oh, it's nighttime.

540
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,400
Dude, what?

541
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:16,920
Dude, what?

542
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,920
Well, there's tons of it down here.

543
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,400
It's going, it's going.

544
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:28,869
I need some stone, though.

545
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:29,910
I'm on it.

546
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:34,789
Sorry.

547
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:36,710
It's too dark.

548
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:37,990
I can't see anything.

549
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:39,109
I'm honestly scared.

550
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:43,829
Wait, how did I ruin it?

551
00:23:43,829 --> 00:23:44,630
What?

552
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:45,589
We're gonna need that bucket.

553
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,029
Yeah, we'll get it, Will.

554
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:50,230
This is a tight fit.

555
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:57,880
All right, this is just the first station.

556
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,119
That means we beat level one.

557
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:00,680
Got it.

558
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,319
Oh, no.

559
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:01,880
Oh, no.

560
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,519
Why's it going so fast?

561
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:03,319
What's fucking happening?

562
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:04,839
Because they've got to run to the station.

563
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:05,339
Oh.

564
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:07,319
We're gonna get money.

565
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:11,000
You can spin your bolts for wagon upgrades.

566
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,960
Oh, what?

567
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,559
New wagons?

568
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:16,059
So we get two bolts.

569
00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:17,019
What do they do?

570
00:24:17,019 --> 00:24:18,779
New engines and you unlock.

571
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:19,980
Crafting speed.

572
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,180
So it makes track fast.

573
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:22,619
More...

574
00:24:22,619 --> 00:24:24,660
Is this a water tank?

575
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,660
Or more...

576
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,960
Or more supplies can go in there to be crafted.

577
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:36,519
I think it's gonna be difficult to deal with the speed.

578
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:40,039
We need more, like, stacks in the storage thing.

579
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:41,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

580
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,440
Let's do that.

581
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,279
But then we got new wagon.

582
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:45,480
Lights up in the dark.

583
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,559
What's this one?

584
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,099
Crafting speed of 60%.

585
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:53,220
Converts wood to iron or iron to wood.

586
00:24:55,059 --> 00:24:56,819
Steam engine for the Wild West.

587
00:24:56,819 --> 00:24:57,299
How do we go fast?

588
00:24:57,299 --> 00:24:58,019
Where's our money?

589
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,619
Is it one more bolt?

590
00:25:01,619 --> 00:25:02,660
Yeah, we only have one bolt.

591
00:25:04,579 --> 00:25:06,180
Let's get capacity on this thing.

592
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:10,660
Yeah, that's good.

593
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,859
We're good, we're good, we're good.

594
00:25:11,859 --> 00:25:14,740
That's 60% faster and extra stacks.

595
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,779
Exit stand here.

596
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,240
Which one of these is correct?

597
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,160
I think exit stand here.

598
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,599
Exit stand here, dude.

599
00:25:26,819 --> 00:25:28,740
All right, Chad's mad that we didn't get a ghost.

600
00:25:29,619 --> 00:25:31,769
I don't know what it meant.

601
00:25:33,509 --> 00:25:36,869
All right, we don't have time to sit around and dilly dally.

602
00:25:38,309 --> 00:25:41,049
We surely do not.

603
00:25:41,049 --> 00:25:42,410
How come I can't pickaxe?

604
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:46,619
We didn't get a ghost.

605
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,500
Is some stone not...

606
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:49,980
Is only the...

607
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,859
Yeah, you can't do the black, gray stone.

608
00:25:54,859 --> 00:25:55,180
I got it.

609
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:57,819
This song absolutely fucking just is...

610
00:25:58,619 --> 00:25:59,339
Slaps.

611
00:25:59,339 --> 00:26:02,619
Yeah, I was trying to think of that word and I'm too old to know what it was.

612
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:07,579
Okay, we know who the real boomer is.

613
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:14,539
Oh, you guys better be making a path.

614
00:26:15,819 --> 00:26:16,460
We need wood.

615
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,019
I mean, we need...

616
00:26:17,019 --> 00:26:17,900
Yeah, go for it.

617
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:24,009
You can't just see hanging out with some of your friends.

618
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:25,849
Just building a train track.

619
00:26:27,289 --> 00:26:27,690
You could get this.

620
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:28,410
Oh, I put the wood in.

621
00:26:29,529 --> 00:26:30,730
We need stone.

622
00:26:31,529 --> 00:26:32,329
Where is it?

623
00:26:32,329 --> 00:26:32,970
I've been hitting it.

624
00:26:34,089 --> 00:26:37,539
Okay, we're bringing you the torch.

625
00:26:37,539 --> 00:26:39,779
You guys just want to make like a super big path.

626
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:41,059
Don't leave all the tools back here.

627
00:26:42,019 --> 00:26:42,980
Across the wall.

628
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,259
Uh-oh, we're on fire.

629
00:26:44,579 --> 00:26:45,140
I'll handle it.

630
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,019
I'm the oldest.

631
00:26:47,019 --> 00:26:47,579
I'll handle it.

632
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:54,390
Okay, we...

633
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,750
Yeah, we just go through the stone.

634
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,990
Yeah, we have to start stoning.

635
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:58,630
We need stone.

636
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,630
Start stoning.

637
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:01,430
Start it.

638
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:01,910
I'm going.

639
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:03,509
We actually need wood to go...

640
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:07,029
You all right?

641
00:27:07,029 --> 00:27:07,670
We need to go...

642
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:09,670
We need wood to go across this path here.

643
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:15,079
Gentlemen, we need wood.

644
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,960
Otherwise, this thing ain't going anywhere.

645
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:19,400
I'm wooding.

646
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:24,890
No.

647
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:27,539
Who's got the pick?

648
00:27:27,619 --> 00:27:29,140
It's in front of you.

649
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:29,619
No, it's over...

650
00:27:29,619 --> 00:27:31,380
We're stuck on the wrong side.

651
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:31,880
You got it.

652
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:37,940
Hey, what?

653
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:38,660
Can you say that again?

654
00:27:40,089 --> 00:27:40,589
What?

655
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:42,250
No, say that again.

656
00:27:44,089 --> 00:27:44,970
Don't make me do it.

657
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:45,470
I will.

658
00:27:46,089 --> 00:27:50,440
Okay, can you guys do something?

659
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:50,920
We can't move.

660
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,880
I can't.

661
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,759
Literally can't.

662
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:57,799
Can you literally do something?

663
00:27:57,799 --> 00:27:58,759
No, we can't do anything.

664
00:27:58,759 --> 00:27:59,319
You have to build...

665
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:00,279
No, we're stuck on...

666
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:01,079
No, we lose.

667
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:01,720
You have to do the whole thing.

668
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:03,640
You have to do it all.

669
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,440
We're about to lose.

670
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,130
Oh my god.

671
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:08,329
He's just still chopping.

672
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:11,130
He can't hear us.

673
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:13,690
Well, you kept picking up the fucking thing.

674
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:17,529
I tried to come back there and get things.

675
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:18,170
And you had...

676
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:18,890
You picked them.

677
00:28:20,089 --> 00:28:20,970
Look how easy that was.

678
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:21,769
We need a shitload of wood.

679
00:28:22,329 --> 00:28:24,089
I'm going to fucking scream.

680
00:28:24,089 --> 00:28:25,609
We need a shitload of wood now.

681
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:28,710
In front of us.

682
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:37,990
I'm just getting wood.

683
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,720
You have a clear path to the next area, Ghost.

684
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,220
Fire!

685
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:42,720
We're stuck.

686
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:44,720
Where's the...

687
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,160
I got it.

688
00:28:47,339 --> 00:28:50,680
We need a pickaxe.

689
00:28:54,269 --> 00:28:58,569
Dude, Star, how could you not have made a rubber ducky joke here?

690
00:28:58,569 --> 00:28:58,970
Come on.

691
00:28:58,970 --> 00:28:59,769
Isn't that your thing?

692
00:28:59,769 --> 00:29:01,369
We need to have a track build.

693
00:29:03,609 --> 00:29:04,970
Are these cows going to get in the way?

694
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:07,150
Kill them.

695
00:29:08,009 --> 00:29:09,339
Wait, why are you going that way?

696
00:29:10,059 --> 00:29:11,019
Because that's the station.

697
00:29:14,009 --> 00:29:14,509
Kill them.

698
00:29:17,049 --> 00:29:18,329
We need stone bat.

699
00:29:23,869 --> 00:29:25,150
All right, I got you on stone.

700
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,079
This is too stressful.

701
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,359
It's actually less stressful than the last game so far.

702
00:29:42,859 --> 00:29:43,359
All right.

703
00:29:43,579 --> 00:29:44,079
Excuse me?

704
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:47,119
You can go up.

705
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:49,119
If you wanted to go up, that'd be good.

706
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,480
No, go straight across.

707
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:53,920
Well, you got to go up eventually because that's...

708
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,359
Yeah, but we just go up one here.

709
00:29:58,359 --> 00:29:59,400
And it's all cleared.

710
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:02,200
Yeah, but like we can just go straight across.

711
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:05,130
Like this, ready?

712
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:10,089
All right, now we need wood.

713
00:30:10,089 --> 00:30:11,049
Where's the axe?

714
00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:13,359
I'm killing the cows with it.

715
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:16,200
That's great use of our materials.

716
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,160
We desperately need wood.

717
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,400
Good use of the materials.

718
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,759
You murdering animals.

719
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:21,259
Good.

720
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,279
I want to make sure our train doesn't hit a fucking cow.

721
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,799
Oh, there's gold down there at the bottom.

722
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:29,920
You see that shit?

723
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,640
They're actually...

724
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,440
What is that?

725
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:31,920
Wow, there's so much gold.

726
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,799
Turn it around.

727
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:33,359
Turn it around.

728
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:33,759
Turn it around.

729
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:34,259
Turn it around.

730
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,200
Turn this around.

731
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,640
I think...

732
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,880
Do we just need to pick it up or does the train need to pass?

733
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,319
Train has to hit it for sure.

734
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:41,880
How do you know?

735
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,519
How do you know?

736
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,839
That has to be what this is.

737
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:46,519
How about we try the easier thing first?

738
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:49,700
All right.

739
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:50,579
Chop.

740
00:30:51,039 --> 00:31:00,750
Gotta get the upgrade map.

741
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:01,630
How are we going to...

742
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:03,150
Oh my god, you just turned it...

743
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:03,710
No, no, no.

744
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:04,670
Don't do that.

745
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:05,710
You're doing it right.

746
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:06,109
No, no, no.

747
00:31:06,109 --> 00:31:07,390
Because it has to cross.

748
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:08,589
How are we going to put it back the right way?

749
00:31:08,589 --> 00:31:09,150
The old track.

750
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:10,349
Yeah, we can pick the old track.

751
00:31:10,349 --> 00:31:10,849
Yep.

752
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:22,029
Oh, you can make some big stacks.

753
00:31:22,029 --> 00:31:22,529
Fire.

754
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:24,509
Fire.

755
00:31:24,509 --> 00:31:25,009
Fire.

756
00:31:25,009 --> 00:31:25,710
Oh shit, I got it.

757
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:26,210
I got it.

758
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:29,890
Oh.

759
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:33,789
All right, I need regular old wood.

760
00:31:33,789 --> 00:31:34,349
Regular wood.

761
00:31:34,349 --> 00:31:35,069
There's quick...

762
00:31:35,069 --> 00:31:36,029
On the board here.

763
00:31:36,029 --> 00:31:36,829
Make a path.

764
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:41,049
You gotta hurry or it's gonna cut us off.

765
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:43,369
You gotta do it from the other way.

766
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:53,259
All right, now we need wood inside the train.

767
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,400
Okay.

768
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,299
Okay, I picked it up.

769
00:31:56,299 --> 00:31:57,500
The train doesn't need to touch it.

770
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,099
Wait, you got it?

771
00:31:59,099 --> 00:31:59,740
Fuck you guys.

772
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:00,220
Yeah, I got it.

773
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:00,700
Okay, wait, wait.

774
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:01,339
Hold on, hold on.

775
00:32:01,339 --> 00:32:02,059
I told you.

776
00:32:03,019 --> 00:32:04,220
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

777
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:07,339
Now we can't pick up the track.

778
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:14,170
Uh oh, we can't pick up the track.

779
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:14,670
No.

780
00:32:15,049 --> 00:32:16,650
What happens if you loop it in on itself?

781
00:32:17,609 --> 00:32:18,410
Put one in between.

782
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,039
No, put one on the other side.

783
00:32:24,269 --> 00:32:24,990
Oh, you can't.

784
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:27,700
Ah.

785
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,369
Yeah, you can't pick it up after it goes over the track.

786
00:32:33,369 --> 00:32:34,329
We're going up.

787
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:34,829
No.

788
00:32:36,009 --> 00:32:38,000
Can we go to the bottom?

789
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,799
Can we get through?

790
00:32:41,289 --> 00:32:41,789
Hold on.

791
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,839
We can't get through this.

792
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:45,480
You fucked us.

793
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:49,480
Well, it seemed reasonable that the train would have to pass over.

794
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,160
No, just check first.

795
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,160
Because you have to build the bridge no matter what.

796
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,720
And we had like seven stacks of wood.

797
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,759
You could have built the bridge over there with your axe and checked it for us.

798
00:32:58,759 --> 00:32:59,880
I'm not giving up yet.

799
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,519
Don't give up yet.

800
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:01,019
Hold on.

801
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,220
Oops.

802
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,559
Okay, you're going to yell at me.

803
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:07,559
I'm the one who fucking noticed it in the first place.

804
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:11,160
You fucking entitled, spoiled brat.

805
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,920
If Star hadn't have noticed the golden nugget,

806
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,119
then we wouldn't have even gone for it.

807
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:16,440
And we would have still been training to the right.

808
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,240
I saw it.

809
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,319
And I said, build a bridge first.

810
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:21,640
And then Jerma said, no, turn the train.

811
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,880
And then I fucking spit in his coffee.

812
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:27,160
That's my secret.

813
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,319
My coffee is exclusively made out of spit.

814
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:31,549
All right.

815
00:33:31,549 --> 00:33:32,109
Try again.

816
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:34,599
All right.

817
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:36,039
Do we have to hide everything?

818
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:36,680
I don't think so.

819
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,240
Why'd you leave?

820
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,279
I fucked up, dude.

821
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:41,079
I fucked up.

822
00:33:41,079 --> 00:33:42,440
Have you ever fucked up before?

823
00:33:47,069 --> 00:33:47,309
No.

824
00:33:47,309 --> 00:33:47,950
Would you leave?

825
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:50,740
No.

826
00:33:53,579 --> 00:33:54,539
Hide everything again.

827
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,220
Give us a session ID.

828
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,799
Oh, I'm sorry.

829
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:02,160
You have to press a hotkey for a session ID.

830
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,279
We had progress.

831
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:05,759
Dude, it's way past my bedtime.

832
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:07,440
If anyone here is going to complain, it's me.

833
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,679
Yeah, but this game is very fun, though.

834
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:10,880
This is fun.

835
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,000
I was on easy.

836
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,320
And we got one checkpoint.

837
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:14,960
That was not easy.

838
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,159
Turn it up to hard mode.

839
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:16,880
Put it on hard, then.

840
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:19,260
We can't.

841
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:20,860
You know we can't.

842
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:23,340
Then do it on medium.

843
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:27,920
But you may have to make the seed something fun.

844
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,360
No, that is something fun.

845
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:31,789
Krungus?

846
00:34:31,789 --> 00:34:33,550
The last time I touched the seed, it, like,

847
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:34,909
freeze my game.

848
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,000
All right, we're good.

849
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,719
Who's making it?

850
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,159
He's got the code.

851
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,000
There, I made it.

852
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,559
We're in here.

853
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:43,940
Oh.

854
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,679
I'm Skullman again.

855
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:50,510
All right, I'm joining.

856
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:51,710
Yeah, why would you join?

857
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,309
Look, well, now we understand how the game works.

858
00:34:54,619 --> 00:34:55,119
I don't.

859
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:58,480
But you can kill it.

860
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,000
You figured out how to kill cows.

861
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,500
Yeah.

862
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,300
And stop touching!

863
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,739
We had it ready, like, a minute ago,

864
00:35:03,739 --> 00:35:05,340
and you come in here and start touching shit.

865
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,219
All right, but you can play on,

866
00:35:06,219 --> 00:35:07,820
you can play with checkpoints, though.

867
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:10,539
You can restart at the first station in each biome.

868
00:35:10,539 --> 00:35:12,619
But he left the game because he's,

869
00:35:12,619 --> 00:35:13,820
just, something wrong with him.

870
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,980
I didn't want to do the same map again, okay?

871
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,260
Let's go, Taleks!

872
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:22,699
Playing on medium.

873
00:35:22,699 --> 00:35:23,199
Here we go.

874
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:29,420
All right, pick a tool.

875
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,619
Probably eats his stakes for catching.

876
00:35:30,619 --> 00:35:31,900
I'll build the track.

877
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:33,820
Keep the tool in your hand.

878
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,179
Let's do this efficiently, okay?

879
00:35:37,179 --> 00:35:39,900
Okay, I'm just gonna break every single one of these blocks.

880
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:41,820
Well, I can't say blocks.

881
00:35:42,699 --> 00:35:43,260
How about this?

882
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:46,380
We're gonna get so many resources in this first area.

883
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,699
Jerma is just the pick up resources

884
00:35:48,699 --> 00:35:50,300
and then put the track down.

885
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,340
And we just chop.

886
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,179
Jerma's already using...

887
00:35:53,179 --> 00:35:54,059
I'm resourceful.

888
00:35:54,059 --> 00:35:55,019
I'm pickaxe up top.

889
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,320
And once you connect it, I'm gonna go chop the other side.

890
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,000
Okay, I need some help putting that stone in.

891
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:03,159
Give me one more.

892
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:04,920
Get one more across or we're gonna die.

893
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:10,420
Keep me!

894
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,500
Oh, we gotta do this quick.

895
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,000
Yeah.

896
00:36:14,619 --> 00:36:15,260
It's on medium.

897
00:36:16,059 --> 00:36:19,440
You thought hard was gonna be workful?

898
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:20,809
Could you not?

899
00:36:21,449 --> 00:36:29,039
All right, gold nugget in the waterfall on the top.

900
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:31,280
Okay, turn the train, turn the train.

901
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:33,599
I'll go get it.

902
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,920
I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it.

903
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,199
All right, you need to make some extra bridges

904
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:38,000
or you're stuck over here.

905
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:41,440
I need some wood to get that gold piece.

906
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:44,570
Follow me, I'm chopping all of it.

907
00:36:45,449 --> 00:36:48,840
Sorry, there must be water in the bucket.

908
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:51,440
There was.

909
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,320
The flame is out.

910
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:52,820
What the fuck?

911
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:53,320
What the fuck, dude?

912
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:01,519
We need a bridge here or shit's about to get real bad.

913
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:02,719
We need a track here.

914
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:04,079
Uh-oh, it's about to get real bad.

915
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:06,800
And we can't bring the track unless you put some wood here

916
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,719
and you're the master of all of the woods.

917
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,659
You need to chop this tree, you need to chop this tree.

918
00:37:15,139 --> 00:37:16,179
Chop, chop.

919
00:37:16,179 --> 00:37:17,139
All right, that's not mean.

920
00:37:19,659 --> 00:37:20,940
No, no, we need that pickaxe.

921
00:37:22,219 --> 00:37:24,059
Back up, back up pickaxe.

922
00:37:24,059 --> 00:37:25,659
I have the track.

923
00:37:25,659 --> 00:37:27,260
And the water bucket, dude.

924
00:37:28,139 --> 00:37:29,420
Dude, dude.

925
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:32,159
Oh my God.

926
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:33,360
Get the water bucket.

927
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:40,190
All right, I'm going to put these ahead of us.

928
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,460
How about these?

929
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:59,780
We're going to drive the train.

930
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:02,900
The gold piece.

931
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:12,510
We're going to need some mining.

932
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,269
And I'm going for it.

933
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:17,920
Train's turning too wide.

934
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:21,940
Fire up.

935
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:23,809
Train's on fire.

936
00:38:23,809 --> 00:38:24,309
Here we go.

937
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:26,960
We're good.

938
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,920
Checkpoint one.

939
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,420
Done.

940
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,829
Oh, easy this was.

941
00:38:33,909 --> 00:38:35,510
One more track.

942
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,079
And we can say we did it.

943
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:41,539
And let's actually put our points in something cool this time

944
00:38:41,539 --> 00:38:43,860
rather than something, uh, stupid.

945
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,699
Honestly, the things that we did were not bad.

946
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:47,139
It was very helpful.

947
00:38:47,139 --> 00:38:48,340
With three bolts, we only had two.

948
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:48,840
They were good.

949
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:52,420
Oh, by the way, it's not a gold piece you pick up.

950
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,699
You pick it, it's a bolt.

951
00:38:53,699 --> 00:38:54,420
I know.

952
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,460
They're so important, holy shit.

953
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,579
It's a piece of bolt.

954
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:00,610
Convert raw materials to track.

955
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:01,730
This is just another one.

956
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:02,369
What did you just get?

957
00:39:03,329 --> 00:39:06,280
I'm supposed to come to it.

958
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,559
Increases this.

959
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:09,079
I don't know what he got actually.

960
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:10,360
Yeah, I got increased size.

961
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:12,119
Come on.

962
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:12,840
It's important.

963
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,000
Well, there's two that look the same, but they're not the same.

964
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,760
It's pretty sure you got the right one.

965
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,480
Dynamite?

966
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,360
Plus two size.

967
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,500
Dynamite might be fun.

968
00:39:21,219 --> 00:39:22,739
Auto mine commodities.

969
00:39:22,739 --> 00:39:23,460
That's pretty.

970
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,659
That sounds pretty good.

971
00:39:24,659 --> 00:39:26,659
But we spent all the bolts already.

972
00:39:26,659 --> 00:39:28,820
So I'll put it.

973
00:39:29,139 --> 00:39:31,059
Germa just spent the bolt.

974
00:39:31,059 --> 00:39:33,539
I'm glad we came to consensus.

975
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,920
That's why it auto mines things around it.

976
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,599
That's like a no brainer.

977
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:39,480
That's the first one you should get.

978
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:47,269
But when you put it at the front then, instead of the back?

979
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:51,460
It doesn't matter.

980
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,179
What's the radius?

981
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:54,869
Can you reorganize?

982
00:39:55,829 --> 00:39:59,380
It should be right here next to the water tank.

983
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,360
He just does things.

984
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,159
All right, let's go.

985
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,219
You're a little brother.

986
00:40:05,219 --> 00:40:05,860
He just did it.

987
00:40:06,659 --> 00:40:10,980
See if we can get two checkpoints.

988
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:14,099
And he presses the button and you're like, okay,

989
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:15,780
I guess that's how we're going to play.

990
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:20,099
And I just get my finger jammed almost to the palm of my hand up my nose.

991
00:40:21,699 --> 00:40:23,360
We going straight?

992
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,260
Yes.

993
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:40,820
Look, it's auto mining.

994
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:43,599
I actually can't tell what this is doing.

995
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:48,849
Now it's an awkward space between where the track comes out

996
00:40:48,849 --> 00:40:50,449
and where the track ingredients go in.

997
00:40:50,449 --> 00:40:53,809
What are the two hamburger buns?

998
00:40:53,809 --> 00:40:54,309
What does that mean?

999
00:40:55,250 --> 00:41:01,039
Which way do you want to take this?

1000
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:05,889
I'm just getting material.

1001
00:41:05,889 --> 00:41:09,170
Go south and go across the water or go north and go through all the trees.

1002
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:10,929
I think we just go through all the stuff.

1003
00:41:10,929 --> 00:41:11,489
Forget about the water.

1004
00:41:11,489 --> 00:41:13,409
I don't think the auto miner is doing anything.

1005
00:41:14,849 --> 00:41:15,809
Yeah, let's go through the trees.

1006
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:19,329
Maybe it's got ingredients in there and you have to take them out.

1007
00:41:19,329 --> 00:41:20,050
Feed it stone.

1008
00:41:20,849 --> 00:41:21,570
Put stone in it.

1009
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:26,869
All right, I'm making a turn.

1010
00:41:26,869 --> 00:41:27,349
You're right.

1011
00:41:27,349 --> 00:41:29,030
You don't really have any spare stone.

1012
00:41:29,909 --> 00:41:30,949
We have a lot of it up here.

1013
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,039
Turn south.

1014
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:35,119
We need trees.

1015
00:41:37,889 --> 00:41:39,809
Yeah, OK, it takes.

1016
00:41:39,809 --> 00:41:46,900
You have to use two stone to turn it on and turn it off.

1017
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:49,590
Are we going straight or are we going?

1018
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,550
We're just going straight, right?

1019
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:51,110
Go across the water.

1020
00:41:51,829 --> 00:41:52,849
So we're going down.

1021
00:41:53,809 --> 00:41:56,869
Yeah, go well.

1022
00:41:56,869 --> 00:42:01,969
Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.

1023
00:42:02,769 --> 00:42:05,909
Where's the pickaxe?

1024
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,599
I'm using it.

1025
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:08,099
All right.

1026
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,519
Are those birds shitting on it?

1027
00:42:16,519 --> 00:42:26,159
I'm going to fill up the tank.

1028
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:29,519
So I think you can preemptively cool the engine with water every so often

1029
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:31,760
without having to wait for it to catch on fire.

1030
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,320
Oh, shit, this stuff actually, it does do this.

1031
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:36,079
That's actually pretty sick.

1032
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:40,639
Yeah, it cuts down all like everything around it as long as it's got power.

1033
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:41,920
Why do we get this weird haze?

1034
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,239
It's called fog.

1035
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:46,639
I know you only see when you go outside, but we're not used to that.

1036
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:47,760
What's going on with this track?

1037
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:51,909
What's going on with the track?

1038
00:42:52,869 --> 00:42:53,349
Why did that?

1039
00:42:59,829 --> 00:43:01,429
Wait, are we making it go?

1040
00:43:01,429 --> 00:43:02,070
What are we doing?

1041
00:43:02,869 --> 00:43:06,230
I would really like to pick this squiggle track up, but it's fine.

1042
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:06,730
Oh, OK.

1043
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:07,230
OK.

1044
00:43:10,519 --> 00:43:12,949
Don't lose that bucket of water.

1045
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:19,369
I'll turn the train around.

1046
00:43:19,369 --> 00:43:20,010
We missed something.

1047
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:23,050
All right.

1048
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:24,329
Get a stack of wood over here.

1049
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:27,820
Fire.

1050
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:29,780
Oh, it's getting dark.

1051
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:31,480
Shit.

1052
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:32,900
There's the bucket.

1053
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:33,860
Shit.

1054
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:34,360
Dark.

1055
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:35,460
Shit.

1056
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:36,260
Get a stack of wood.

1057
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:37,460
Stack of wood.

1058
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:37,960
What?

1059
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:39,699
We got to make track.

1060
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,139
You got to get over here.

1061
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:43,139
I'm chopping wood.

1062
00:43:43,139 --> 00:43:43,940
Just get the wood.

1063
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:44,260
I got it.

1064
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:45,139
OK, OK, OK, OK, OK.

1065
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:47,579
All right, start.

1066
00:43:48,539 --> 00:43:50,380
This is why I didn't want to come over here.

1067
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:51,820
This is why I didn't want to come over.

1068
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:53,900
Now pick it up and bring it over here.

1069
00:43:57,099 --> 00:43:57,579
Thank you.

1070
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:00,539
Chopping wood.

1071
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,579
This is going to be cutting it close.

1072
00:44:03,579 --> 00:44:04,940
OK, we need, I need.

1073
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:15,400
I'm chopping wood.

1074
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:25,750
Where's the, are we going up?

1075
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:29,030
That's a decision for you guys to make.

1076
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:30,150
All right, we're going up.

1077
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:31,269
We're following him.

1078
00:44:31,269 --> 00:44:31,909
Already is.

1079
00:44:31,989 --> 00:44:33,190
I got to kill these boys.

1080
00:44:38,329 --> 00:44:39,369
Wood's more important right now.

1081
00:44:41,659 --> 00:44:43,349
We don't lose any tools.

1082
00:44:43,349 --> 00:44:44,230
I'm moving the bucket up here.

1083
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:52,219
Oops.

1084
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,199
Oh, tallax.

1085
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,039
Oh.

1086
00:44:56,039 --> 00:44:57,800
To be fair, it doesn't highlight.

1087
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,599
Is that going to crash?

1088
00:44:58,599 --> 00:44:59,099
Yeah.

1089
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:00,619
No.

1090
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:02,949
All right, we need stone.

1091
00:45:06,519 --> 00:45:07,159
Don't get caught.

1092
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:09,400
Uh oh.

1093
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:13,900
OK, just keep the train going straight.

1094
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:14,460
Look at what we're about to run into.

1095
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:15,579
You can't dig that stone,

1096
00:45:15,579 --> 00:45:16,619
person trying to dig this.

1097
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:17,179
I'm not.

1098
00:45:17,179 --> 00:45:18,460
I'm trying to have visibility

1099
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:19,659
so we can see ahead of us,

1100
00:45:19,659 --> 00:45:21,179
not dig the stone.

1101
00:45:21,179 --> 00:45:22,539
Hey, person trying to dig the stone.

1102
00:45:24,059 --> 00:45:27,500
All right, we need some extra pass to walk.

1103
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:35,210
OK, we need a lot of wood.

1104
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:36,409
All right, we got to go.

1105
00:45:36,409 --> 00:45:39,059
We got a big, big wood path going south.

1106
00:45:39,059 --> 00:45:40,019
I'm going to keep chopping.

1107
00:45:40,019 --> 00:45:41,139
I'm not going to stop chopping.

1108
00:45:41,139 --> 00:45:42,739
Don't expect me to do anything but chop.

1109
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:43,880
OK.

1110
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:46,420
What about, uh, we don't have any stone.

1111
00:45:48,889 --> 00:45:49,389
Just don't.

1112
00:45:51,699 --> 00:45:54,179
Quick, we're running out of, we're running out of stone.

1113
00:45:55,099 --> 00:45:55,659
I got it.

1114
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:00,389
We're going to have a big problem here in a second.

1115
00:46:00,389 --> 00:46:03,510
Big problem incoming.

1116
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:04,010
Stone.

1117
00:46:05,349 --> 00:46:08,780
Stone.

1118
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:10,219
I'm making stone.

1119
00:46:10,219 --> 00:46:10,719
Fire.

1120
00:46:11,659 --> 00:46:15,280
Bucket.

1121
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:16,980
Oh no, I'm getting stuck.

1122
00:46:17,699 --> 00:46:18,579
Bucket's up there, we're good.

1123
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:20,260
Um, I don't know what to do.

1124
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:23,000
There's bolts at the top,

1125
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
so don't connect the last piece of track until you have to.

1126
00:46:35,219 --> 00:46:37,460
Actually, I don't think there's trees for us to get it.

1127
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:38,340
Is there not enough trees?

1128
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:40,500
Hold on.

1129
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,000
It might be.

1130
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:42,730
I got it, I got it.

1131
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:43,369
We're doing it.

1132
00:46:43,369 --> 00:46:43,929
I got it, I got it.

1133
00:46:43,929 --> 00:46:44,429
You guys do this.

1134
00:46:45,449 --> 00:46:47,369
I'm trying to get this thing.

1135
00:46:47,369 --> 00:46:48,809
I need, like, one more piece.

1136
00:46:48,809 --> 00:46:50,489
Can I die if I don't move?

1137
00:46:50,489 --> 00:46:51,690
Is it OK if I connect it?

1138
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:52,190
I don't know.

1139
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:54,250
Uh, don't do it yet.

1140
00:46:55,130 --> 00:46:56,489
Because if you connect it, it finishes.

1141
00:46:58,010 --> 00:47:01,289
And then we can't build up materials and stuff.

1142
00:47:01,289 --> 00:47:02,889
What do you, oh, there's a golden ticket.

1143
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:12,820
We need more wood for that.

1144
00:47:17,579 --> 00:47:18,860
We're going to need another track.

1145
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:21,099
Track is right to the top of you, Stark.

1146
00:47:21,099 --> 00:47:21,900
OK.

1147
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:22,139
Wood?

1148
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:23,019
How much more do we have?

1149
00:47:23,019 --> 00:47:23,739
Hold on, hold on.

1150
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:25,500
It's not enough.

1151
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:26,300
It's not enough.

1152
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:26,780
It's not enough.

1153
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:27,260
It's not enough.

1154
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:28,460
How do we get more wood?

1155
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:29,260
We need one wood.

1156
00:47:30,539 --> 00:47:31,099
Is there a tree?

1157
00:47:31,099 --> 00:47:32,460
We'll be able to do it after it parks.

1158
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:37,860
Periodically, I hope.

1159
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:42,039
That's not an all-in-one spot.

1160
00:47:42,039 --> 00:47:42,599
All right.

1161
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:44,039
I'm just going to buy a random thing.

1162
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:47,559
We only have one bolt, so I really, we could just save.

1163
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:53,829
Why not just save?

1164
00:47:54,469 --> 00:47:56,469
I want crafting speed stack side.

1165
00:47:57,739 --> 00:47:59,260
That's not that's not bad, actually.

1166
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:00,860
Put it in a good spot.

1167
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:01,500
Don't do what I do.

1168
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:03,579
That's not great.

1169
00:48:03,579 --> 00:48:05,659
So it's the same speed stack size.

1170
00:48:05,659 --> 00:48:08,219
We were not once waiting on the track.

1171
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:09,260
What have you done?

1172
00:48:10,139 --> 00:48:13,480
Stack size is nice because then you can take stuff

1173
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:16,199
because we always have like a full stack of shit in here.

1174
00:48:18,949 --> 00:48:19,989
It works out.

1175
00:48:19,989 --> 00:48:23,829
I mean, you could if we saved, you can actually make the auto miner like good.

1176
00:48:23,829 --> 00:48:26,340
Let's go.

1177
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:29,059
Plus two range on the auto miner.

1178
00:48:29,619 --> 00:48:31,239
I mean, that's pretty good, too.

1179
00:48:32,969 --> 00:48:33,769
We only have one bolt.

1180
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:36,469
Ghost wagon and dynamite are the best.

1181
00:48:38,059 --> 00:48:39,500
Also a better craft.

1182
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,739
Like you can get a second raw material wagon.

1183
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:45,099
OK, but we only had one bolt and now we have no bolts.

1184
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:47,019
What does this let you die?

1185
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:50,409
What does the ghost wagon do?

1186
00:48:50,409 --> 00:48:53,269
You die, you go to the other side.

1187
00:48:53,269 --> 00:48:53,750
What does that mean?

1188
00:48:57,110 --> 00:48:57,989
We can still get that.

1189
00:49:00,539 --> 00:49:03,260
Yeah, we can wrap around and get it.

1190
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:04,219
We could just walk to it.

1191
00:49:04,219 --> 00:49:04,780
Holy shit.

1192
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:05,500
Yeah, just walk.

1193
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:06,300
Oh, man.

1194
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:07,260
We could just walk to it.

1195
00:49:08,659 --> 00:49:11,659
We could just walk to it.

1196
00:49:11,659 --> 00:49:14,219
We need to work pretty fast because we're in this awkward.

1197
00:49:15,019 --> 00:49:19,340
Yeah, I'm trying to dig wide so we have some space to move.

1198
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:27,590
There's a bunch of stone on the other side of the river, too.

1199
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:27,989
Isn't it?

1200
00:49:27,989 --> 00:49:28,869
You can just build stone.

1201
00:49:28,869 --> 00:49:29,510
We don't need stone.

1202
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:33,960
Ram on this thing on.

1203
00:49:36,389 --> 00:49:36,789
All right.

1204
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:39,110
Oh, fuck.

1205
00:49:39,829 --> 00:49:40,389
Oh, fuck.

1206
00:49:40,389 --> 00:49:40,789
Oh, fuck.

1207
00:49:40,789 --> 00:49:42,070
It's fucking great.

1208
00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:43,269
I can't reach it.

1209
00:49:43,269 --> 00:49:43,670
Hold on.

1210
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:45,269
I can't move.

1211
00:49:45,269 --> 00:49:54,260
I was not involved in that.

1212
00:49:55,139 --> 00:49:55,699
I panicked.

1213
00:49:55,699 --> 00:49:56,099
I'm sorry.

1214
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:01,769
Who are these bandits?

1215
00:50:02,329 --> 00:50:03,559
I don't know.

1216
00:50:03,559 --> 00:50:04,360
I've been killing them.

1217
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:11,079
I think they steal your stuff if you let them probably.

1218
00:50:11,639 --> 00:50:11,800
All right.

1219
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:12,440
We're going to double up.

1220
00:50:14,739 --> 00:50:17,059
We still have access, by the way, to the pickaxe.

1221
00:50:17,059 --> 00:50:17,380
Where is it?

1222
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:17,619
Okay.

1223
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:23,539
What do we need?

1224
00:50:24,179 --> 00:50:24,820
Any tracks?

1225
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:25,380
Make some calls.

1226
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:25,780
Make some calls.

1227
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:26,179
What do we need?

1228
00:50:27,139 --> 00:50:27,940
I got it.

1229
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:31,539
We're going to go follow the rubber ducky.

1230
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:34,179
Or just follow where he's digging right now.

1231
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:40,650
We need stone delivered.

1232
00:50:48,070 --> 00:50:49,030
We got wood and stone.

1233
00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:49,429
There you go.

1234
00:50:49,429 --> 00:50:49,989
We got wood.

1235
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:51,110
All right.

1236
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:51,349
Dig.

1237
00:50:52,309 --> 00:50:53,989
I'm going to mine like a secondary path.

1238
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,420
Each player has to mine a rock.

1239
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:00,980
What did it say?

1240
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:03,619
It's like an achievement thing.

1241
00:51:04,579 --> 00:51:06,789
All right.

1242
00:51:06,789 --> 00:51:07,750
We need to kill the cows.

1243
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:10,940
They move out of the way.

1244
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:11,500
You really don't.

1245
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:15,179
No, I just wanted to kill some cows.

1246
00:51:15,179 --> 00:51:15,980
Put some stone in that machine.

1247
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:16,619
It's so high up.

1248
00:51:16,619 --> 00:51:16,940
Beef.

1249
00:51:18,059 --> 00:51:20,570
All right.

1250
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:21,289
Where's that pickaxe?

1251
00:51:21,849 --> 00:51:22,840
I got it.

1252
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,500
Play down here, too.

1253
00:51:27,699 --> 00:51:27,940
What?

1254
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:30,099
So we're going to have two paths.

1255
00:51:32,329 --> 00:51:33,050
What are you saying?

1256
00:51:33,929 --> 00:51:35,369
See the wooden path I made to the stone?

1257
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:36,889
That's just more stone.

1258
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:43,030
Well, we need to go forward.

1259
00:51:44,469 --> 00:51:44,630
Yeah.

1260
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:45,989
The autominer's just got stuff.

1261
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:50,860
Can we hit the cows or what?

1262
00:51:51,739 --> 00:51:53,099
No, they walk away from the track.

1263
00:51:53,099 --> 00:51:53,579
Walk away.

1264
00:51:53,579 --> 00:51:53,820
Okay.

1265
00:51:54,619 --> 00:51:58,659
All right.

1266
00:51:58,659 --> 00:51:59,380
We need trees.

1267
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:01,860
We need this cut down up front.

1268
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,380
And then we're pretty much there.

1269
00:52:04,659 --> 00:52:06,539
I'm going for the tree.

1270
00:52:06,539 --> 00:52:07,260
We got a bolt.

1271
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:13,269
We'll let you do it.

1272
00:52:13,909 --> 00:52:15,300
Fire.

1273
00:52:16,099 --> 00:52:17,420
Oh, it's on fire.

1274
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:18,219
Buckets right up.

1275
00:52:18,219 --> 00:52:18,860
Right on top, top.

1276
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:19,659
Right next to the star.

1277
00:52:19,659 --> 00:52:20,139
No, it's out.

1278
00:52:20,139 --> 00:52:21,099
Who's penguin?

1279
00:52:21,099 --> 00:52:21,820
I'm penguin.

1280
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:22,139
All right.

1281
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:22,940
Talek's penguin.

1282
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:23,579
Yeah, you got it.

1283
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:25,260
All right.

1284
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:26,940
There's an absolute shitload of materials down here.

1285
00:52:27,579 --> 00:52:28,619
Start collecting.

1286
00:52:28,619 --> 00:52:29,820
Feed the autominer.

1287
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:36,139
Good.

1288
00:52:36,139 --> 00:52:36,699
It is looking good.

1289
00:52:36,699 --> 00:52:40,139
Well, don't waste resources on the autominer when it's not near anything.

1290
00:52:41,110 --> 00:52:44,150
Does it consume while it's not near anything, I wonder?

1291
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:45,110
Yeah, it does.

1292
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:47,030
You can see it digging up grass.

1293
00:52:47,909 --> 00:52:49,099
It's digging grass.

1294
00:52:49,099 --> 00:52:49,900
Well, then you can just take it off.

1295
00:52:53,579 --> 00:52:56,619
I wonder if there's upgrades so we can carry more stuff in our hands

1296
00:52:57,659 --> 00:52:58,380
because currently what?

1297
00:52:58,380 --> 00:52:59,019
It's two or three.

1298
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:06,920
Make sure you don't leave any tools.

1299
00:53:11,269 --> 00:53:12,070
Looking good.

1300
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:14,869
Do we have any secret loot?

1301
00:53:15,429 --> 00:53:16,329
There's one over here.

1302
00:53:16,329 --> 00:53:16,570
Behind.

1303
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:17,130
We can get it later.

1304
00:53:17,929 --> 00:53:19,380
We're probably going to get it right now, actually.

1305
00:53:20,099 --> 00:53:21,139
How are we doing on track?

1306
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:24,820
We got like a small stack back there.

1307
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:26,019
We don't have a lot of wood.

1308
00:53:26,659 --> 00:53:27,619
So, yeah.

1309
00:53:27,619 --> 00:53:28,420
We're about to win.

1310
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:33,079
There is so much stone that I put here.

1311
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:39,980
I think there's enough to get both, isn't there?

1312
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:42,119
Well, yeah, hold on.

1313
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:42,920
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1314
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:43,400
Don't, don't, don't.

1315
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,360
Wait, wait, wait.

1316
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,199
Make sure we have enough track to complete the level.

1317
00:53:49,179 --> 00:53:50,139
This is more important.

1318
00:53:50,139 --> 00:53:50,699
I want gold.

1319
00:53:51,099 --> 00:53:54,889
No, I didn't.

1320
00:54:00,739 --> 00:54:01,860
Can I pick up the last two?

1321
00:54:04,119 --> 00:54:04,920
Fire.

1322
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:06,070
Where's the bucket?

1323
00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:08,230
Where's the bucket?

1324
00:54:09,699 --> 00:54:10,420
Oh, it's not full.

1325
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,119
Where's the bucket?

1326
00:54:12,679 --> 00:54:13,239
He's got it.

1327
00:54:13,239 --> 00:54:22,599
I'm doing it.

1328
00:54:22,599 --> 00:54:23,400
All right, we need one more.

1329
00:54:24,659 --> 00:54:26,340
Still on fire somehow.

1330
00:54:28,179 --> 00:54:29,139
Are we out of wood?

1331
00:54:29,139 --> 00:54:29,639
No.

1332
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:33,659
We just need one more track.

1333
00:54:35,099 --> 00:54:37,030
All right, complete it.

1334
00:54:37,989 --> 00:54:38,489
Yeah.

1335
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:39,610
All right.

1336
00:54:41,639 --> 00:54:42,360
Oh, yeah.

1337
00:54:44,199 --> 00:54:45,480
That's what I'm talking about.

1338
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:47,000
Four fucking bolts.

1339
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,039
All right, that could be a new engine if we wanted it.

1340
00:54:51,239 --> 00:54:52,840
What about the juice box?

1341
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,960
Increases your strength for every animal you bring by.

1342
00:55:01,949 --> 00:55:03,309
That's carrying capacity.

1343
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:05,920
Liquid storage?

1344
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:09,360
You feed cows and you get juice?

1345
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:11,039
Plus 100% capacity.

1346
00:55:11,039 --> 00:55:11,920
That's pretty good.

1347
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:17,449
How do you do that?

1348
00:55:17,449 --> 00:55:20,329
All right, minor tier two.

1349
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:23,519
Can I not move it ever?

1350
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:26,079
How are you doing that, sir?

1351
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:29,280
If you write your right analog stick,

1352
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,760
you press it down, you can create waypoints.

1353
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:32,639
It's kind of annoying.

1354
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:37,289
And then left trigger and right trigger are emotes.

1355
00:55:37,929 --> 00:55:40,679
What did we buy?

1356
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:45,420
I bought the minor expander.

1357
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:47,420
If you're going to have it, it may as well do something.

1358
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:49,659
What about halts the train for a short time,

1359
00:55:49,659 --> 00:55:51,500
dash into it to fill up its charge?

1360
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:53,179
I don't know how to dash.

1361
00:55:54,619 --> 00:55:55,260
Dash is B.

1362
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:00,079
Now we can knock each other off the bridge like in Overcooked 2.

1363
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:01,920
Are we saving the points or what?

1364
00:56:04,969 --> 00:56:05,690
I vote for...

1365
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:10,110
I'm down with the stack size.

1366
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:11,550
Is that just the normal platform?

1367
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:13,389
Halts the train for a short time,

1368
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:15,710
dash into it to fill up its charge.

1369
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:17,469
I feel like we're accidentally going to activate that.

1370
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:18,909
Yeah, we probably are.

1371
00:56:20,590 --> 00:56:23,230
I kind of don't want our train to be longer right now

1372
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:24,670
because we keep getting caught on it.

1373
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:27,019
100% capacity.

1374
00:56:29,369 --> 00:56:30,090
We could save.

1375
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:33,130
I mean, capacity is just capacity.

1376
00:56:33,929 --> 00:56:36,409
Well, that's for the water, right?

1377
00:56:36,409 --> 00:56:37,289
What is this thing for?

1378
00:56:39,070 --> 00:56:40,030
Executive decision.

1379
00:56:40,590 --> 00:56:41,630
What'd you grab?

1380
00:56:41,630 --> 00:56:46,010
What is that?

1381
00:56:46,010 --> 00:56:48,650
Now we're going to make track at a thousand times normal speed.

1382
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:49,849
Yeah.

1383
00:56:49,849 --> 00:56:52,989
Wait, what was that one?

1384
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:57,199
Increase the capacity and build speed for tracks.

1385
00:56:57,199 --> 00:56:58,079
Cool waypoints.

1386
00:56:58,079 --> 00:56:58,639
Pretty useful.

1387
00:56:58,639 --> 00:56:59,599
Plenty of track.

1388
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,170
True.

1389
00:57:02,809 --> 00:57:05,340
All right.

1390
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:08,219
I hope you guys are ready to start smashing some trees.

1391
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:12,969
They delete all yours.

1392
00:57:12,969 --> 00:57:15,610
Oh, no, we got to go to water preemptively

1393
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:17,289
just for when we need to douse it.

1394
00:57:18,409 --> 00:57:28,139
Capacity.

1395
00:57:28,139 --> 00:57:28,380
Good.

1396
00:57:29,019 --> 00:57:29,659
Cool.

1397
00:57:29,659 --> 00:57:30,139
Auto mine.

1398
00:57:30,139 --> 00:57:32,699
We're going to need to start mining stone up here.

1399
00:57:33,739 --> 00:57:36,699
Which way are we going?

1400
00:57:36,699 --> 00:57:37,980
Up or just to the right?

1401
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:40,860
Up and then right.

1402
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:44,409
What's up here?

1403
00:57:45,449 --> 00:57:46,489
Where's the stone?

1404
00:57:46,489 --> 00:57:47,849
You turn the track around.

1405
00:57:48,489 --> 00:57:49,530
Yeah, you hang on.

1406
00:57:49,530 --> 00:57:50,170
What are you talking about?

1407
00:57:50,969 --> 00:57:51,369
You did.

1408
00:57:51,369 --> 00:57:53,130
Yeah, that's not what you want to do.

1409
00:58:00,639 --> 00:58:02,639
You want to go like down and then over.

1410
00:58:04,170 --> 00:58:04,730
How do you do that?

1411
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:05,289
And then right.

1412
00:58:10,409 --> 00:58:21,769
Well, we need to start talking trees.

1413
00:58:22,889 --> 00:58:28,969
You just turned it around.

1414
00:58:29,610 --> 00:58:30,730
Yeah, whatever.

1415
00:58:30,730 --> 00:58:32,809
Well, I thought you like doomed it again

1416
00:58:32,809 --> 00:58:34,329
that we couldn't remove the thing.

1417
00:58:34,329 --> 00:58:36,409
But I think a talent you removed.

1418
00:58:36,409 --> 00:58:37,050
I saved it.

1419
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:39,530
You can remove it if it hasn't driven over it.

1420
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:45,309
Oh, a ton of wood.

1421
00:58:47,309 --> 00:58:49,389
Like too much to even I don't know what to do with it.

1422
00:58:50,429 --> 00:58:55,679
There's no nothing.

1423
00:58:55,679 --> 00:59:01,150
No bridges to build a bucket of water.

1424
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:14,480
Do more auto mining.

1425
00:59:16,159 --> 00:59:18,559
I feel like eventually that would be the best bet.

1426
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:18,960
I think.

1427
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:19,460
Right.

1428
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,400
Let's just have a super auto miner and just build track.

1429
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:29,070
All right.

1430
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:32,670
Can you chop the trees that are going to go

1431
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:34,750
adjacent to where we're building?

1432
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:35,250
Yes.

1433
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:40,780
Well, shouldn't we not because we keep doing that

1434
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:43,019
and then the auto miner doesn't do anything.

1435
00:59:43,019 --> 00:59:45,739
Well, it should do something while it's next to all these rocks.

1436
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:51,739
All right.

1437
00:59:51,739 --> 00:59:55,239
Speaking of rocks.

1438
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:06,239
Yeah, that has to be that has to be this stone has to be in there

1439
01:00:06,239 --> 01:00:07,840
for it to auto mine in the first place.

1440
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:09,599
How do you set those up from a distance?

1441
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:11,900
Yeah.

1442
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:15,820
You just click down right stick.

1443
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:18,199
I'm trapped over here.

1444
01:00:19,239 --> 01:00:20,570
I need a wood cutter.

1445
01:00:22,570 --> 01:00:24,000
I can't help either.

1446
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:34,400
That's auto mining now.

1447
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:38,679
Wow.

1448
01:00:38,679 --> 01:00:39,559
That's insane.

1449
01:00:45,389 --> 01:00:50,699
This one was easy.

1450
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:55,960
So you can pick up cows.

1451
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:56,199
Okay.

1452
01:00:56,199 --> 01:00:57,000
We're on fire.

1453
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,599
Bucket is off the screen.

1454
01:01:02,590 --> 01:01:03,070
Oh my God.

1455
01:01:03,070 --> 01:01:03,570
You got it.

1456
01:01:07,079 --> 01:01:07,880
That was close.

1457
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,719
We need to chop down here.

1458
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:13,880
What a good seed this was.

1459
01:01:14,519 --> 01:01:17,000
Quickly chop down here or else you're dead.

1460
01:01:18,199 --> 01:01:19,320
It's right next to you.

1461
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:19,880
Where is it?

1462
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:24,360
Oh, there is a way out anyway.

1463
01:01:25,159 --> 01:01:28,269
All right.

1464
01:01:28,269 --> 01:01:28,829
You still got it.

1465
01:01:28,829 --> 01:01:29,869
You still got to chop up there.

1466
01:01:31,150 --> 01:01:32,110
You got to chop right here.

1467
01:01:32,110 --> 01:01:32,670
Right here.

1468
01:01:32,670 --> 01:01:33,230
Right here.

1469
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:33,949
Where I'm standing.

1470
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:36,860
Quickly.

1471
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:37,360
Guys.

1472
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:39,179
No, we're good here.

1473
01:01:39,179 --> 01:01:39,679
Guys.

1474
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:40,320
Up.

1475
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:40,960
Chop up.

1476
01:01:44,699 --> 01:01:48,460
I think you're severely underestimating the severity of the situation.

1477
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:48,940
Yes, he is.

1478
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:51,179
He doesn't understand that we can't get the track over there.

1479
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:53,889
You're crazy, dude.

1480
01:01:56,179 --> 01:01:57,059
God.

1481
01:01:57,059 --> 01:01:58,929
All right.

1482
01:01:58,929 --> 01:01:59,650
Are we good?

1483
01:01:59,650 --> 01:02:01,409
Any special things or just go?

1484
01:02:02,449 --> 01:02:05,730
There is a nugget in the top but there's no conceivable way to get that.

1485
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:08,130
And the bucket's gone.

1486
01:02:08,130 --> 01:02:08,530
That's okay.

1487
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:09,329
We made it.

1488
01:02:09,329 --> 01:02:10,210
Does it put itself out?

1489
01:02:13,659 --> 01:02:14,159
Yes.

1490
01:02:15,170 --> 01:02:16,130
We only have one bolt.

1491
01:02:17,110 --> 01:02:18,630
Can't even mine otherwise go.

1492
01:02:19,269 --> 01:02:27,300
Okay, so it needs to be like on constant vigilant bucket duty.

1493
01:02:28,179 --> 01:02:28,579
Yeah.

1494
01:02:28,579 --> 01:02:29,699
We could just buy the upgrade.

1495
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:30,920
Yeah.

1496
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:32,980
Yep.

1497
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:38,920
We're gonna have a problem here in two seconds.

1498
01:02:39,639 --> 01:02:40,139
What's that?

1499
01:02:41,079 --> 01:02:44,519
Because it's a very straight narrow line and this just got way hard.

1500
01:02:44,519 --> 01:02:45,400
Go completely straight.

1501
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:47,159
Just go straight.

1502
01:02:47,159 --> 01:02:48,119
Straight, straight, straight.

1503
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:58,639
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1504
01:02:58,639 --> 01:02:59,840
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1505
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:06,679
There's a stone.

1506
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:09,599
Put stone in there.

1507
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:11,519
Track, track, track, track.

1508
01:03:11,519 --> 01:03:13,280
No one is getting the stone.

1509
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:14,800
I got it.

1510
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:15,840
No one like we need.

1511
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:20,159
I'm having stress.

1512
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:22,579
Okay.

1513
01:03:23,239 --> 01:03:23,960
Bucket, bucket.

1514
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:24,679
Don't leave the bucket.

1515
01:03:24,679 --> 01:03:27,000
This is really, really uh claustrophobic right now.

1516
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,039
Don't leave this bucket back here.

1517
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:29,340
What?

1518
01:03:30,119 --> 01:03:30,849
All right, we're good.

1519
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:36,679
I'm just, I'm 100% digging.

1520
01:03:37,639 --> 01:03:38,139
Right here.

1521
01:03:38,139 --> 01:03:38,840
Oh, man, we are.

1522
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:45,010
Do you see the tree to your left?

1523
01:03:45,650 --> 01:03:46,929
We're gonna run out of stone unless I go up.

1524
01:03:46,929 --> 01:03:49,889
Do you see the tree directly in front of the penguin that's spinning around?

1525
01:03:49,889 --> 01:03:50,610
Oh, guys.

1526
01:03:50,610 --> 01:03:51,570
Guys, it's over.

1527
01:03:51,570 --> 01:03:52,530
Guys, it's over.

1528
01:03:52,530 --> 01:03:53,010
It's not over.

1529
01:03:53,010 --> 01:03:53,809
It's not, it's not over.

1530
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:54,929
Stone.

1531
01:03:54,929 --> 01:03:55,809
We need a lot of stone.

1532
01:03:58,309 --> 01:04:00,630
I had, there's a bridge to come up around the corner,

1533
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:01,750
up top around the engine.

1534
01:04:02,550 --> 01:04:04,159
I got a lot of, uh, stone.

1535
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:10,900
You're not finished.

1536
01:04:16,469 --> 01:04:17,510
Get the auto miner on.

1537
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:20,289
I got, I got, I got, I got it.

1538
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:24,289
I don't want to get stuck back here.

1539
01:04:24,289 --> 01:04:24,789
Fuck.

1540
01:04:25,489 --> 01:04:26,210
Oh, hold on.

1541
01:04:26,210 --> 01:04:26,710
There we go.

1542
01:04:27,650 --> 01:04:29,440
Okay, hold on.

1543
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:34,039
Don't, we're gonna need this pickaxe up here soon.

1544
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:35,639
I got it.

1545
01:04:35,639 --> 01:04:36,360
Where, what do you need it?

1546
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:39,079
Oh, eventually we're going to need to start digging.

1547
01:04:40,719 --> 01:04:41,599
Okay, okay, okay.

1548
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:43,460
That's too cool.

1549
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:44,820
I, nobody, we can't all get in there.

1550
01:04:46,179 --> 01:04:48,369
I'm trying my best.

1551
01:04:48,369 --> 01:04:49,090
We're out of stone.

1552
01:04:49,889 --> 01:04:51,650
No, we're not, no, we're not, no, we're not, no, we're not, no, we're not.

1553
01:04:51,650 --> 01:04:53,010
I'm going straight, straight, straight.

1554
01:04:53,650 --> 01:04:54,849
Get this, get this one right here.

1555
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:55,969
Come on, I'm standing right in front of it.

1556
01:04:55,969 --> 01:04:57,010
We need a lot of stone.

1557
01:04:58,050 --> 01:04:59,570
Whoever's got the pickaxe needs to go.

1558
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:02,769
It's right next to, to the left, to the left, to the right, to the front.

1559
01:05:04,199 --> 01:05:06,679
All right, someone go feed it stone and get the track.

1560
01:05:06,679 --> 01:05:07,480
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

1561
01:05:08,679 --> 01:05:15,079
I didn't do it.

1562
01:05:15,079 --> 01:05:19,199
All right, I'm making a path for you to come through.

1563
01:05:20,710 --> 01:05:21,349
Fuck it.

1564
01:05:21,349 --> 01:05:21,750
Fuck it.

1565
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:22,550
Fuck it alert.

1566
01:05:22,550 --> 01:05:23,190
Fuck it alert.

1567
01:05:23,190 --> 01:05:23,750
Fuck it alert.

1568
01:05:29,219 --> 01:05:30,900
We're going to need a two by two path.

1569
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:32,340
We're screwed in a second.

1570
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:32,840
What do you mean?

1571
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:36,239
This isn't, we're not going to be able to get to the back of the train.

1572
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:38,079
Oh shit, hold on.

1573
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:42,480
Where's it, uh, uh, yep.

1574
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:44,239
No, we're fine, we're fine.

1575
01:05:44,239 --> 01:05:44,880
We're good.

1576
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:45,440
We're relaxed.

1577
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:48,980
I got a thousand stone on me.

1578
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:57,199
I have made it two by two all the way to the station.

1579
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:06,559
Oh no.

1580
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:07,059
Fuck.

1581
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:12,360
We're going to miss the, uh, we're going to miss the, uh, the bolt, the bolt, the bolt.

1582
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:13,079
We can still get it.

1583
01:06:14,199 --> 01:06:15,000
You, I'll do this.

1584
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:15,719
You guys focus on that.

1585
01:06:15,719 --> 01:06:16,599
I'll get this.

1586
01:06:16,599 --> 01:06:17,880
Where's the pickaxe?

1587
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:18,679
I got it.

1588
01:06:18,679 --> 01:06:20,679
You, uh, you build the track.

1589
01:06:20,679 --> 01:06:21,000
Okay.

1590
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:21,960
Go up and get that bolt.

1591
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:22,599
I need it through.

1592
01:06:23,719 --> 01:06:24,440
I need it through.

1593
01:06:25,639 --> 01:06:26,599
I need through.

1594
01:06:27,559 --> 01:06:28,719
I don't.

1595
01:06:28,719 --> 01:06:28,960
Okay.

1596
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:29,760
I got the last piece.

1597
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:34,599
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1598
01:06:34,599 --> 01:06:36,369
Hold it.

1599
01:06:36,369 --> 01:06:37,329
I'm only two away.

1600
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:41,159
Oh yeah.

1601
01:06:41,159 --> 01:06:41,659
Yeah.

1602
01:06:44,519 --> 01:06:46,840
Don't leave me behind up in the mountains.

1603
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:48,119
You'll be all right.

1604
01:06:48,119 --> 01:06:49,619
All right.

1605
01:06:49,619 --> 01:06:50,179
We got four.

1606
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:53,719
Oh yeah.

1607
01:06:56,449 --> 01:06:56,769
All right.

1608
01:06:56,769 --> 01:06:58,769
I'm in favor of water capacity at 100%.

1609
01:06:59,889 --> 01:07:01,119
What's this new one?

1610
01:07:02,239 --> 01:07:03,119
Shows you the way.

1611
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,079
Auto pick up things placed nearby.

1612
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:09,599
I mean, I, I, I think auto pick up.

1613
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:12,639
And water capacity.

1614
01:07:17,409 --> 01:07:17,969
Yeah.

1615
01:07:17,969 --> 01:07:19,090
I'm in favor.

1616
01:07:19,090 --> 01:07:20,289
Auto pick up is pretty huge.

1617
01:07:21,989 --> 01:07:22,869
This is a new thing.

1618
01:07:23,510 --> 01:07:23,670
Yeah.

1619
01:07:23,670 --> 01:07:25,429
I want to put it at the front

1620
01:07:25,429 --> 01:07:27,429
or should I put it after the auto miner?

1621
01:07:27,429 --> 01:07:28,389
Maybe put it at the end.

1622
01:07:29,030 --> 01:07:30,150
Yeah, right back.

1623
01:07:30,150 --> 01:07:31,590
Because then they would just get everything we missed.

1624
01:07:34,599 --> 01:07:35,559
Uh, no, put it in the front.

1625
01:07:37,010 --> 01:07:39,170
It's most likely we're going to be digging near the front.

1626
01:07:39,969 --> 01:07:46,519
You want water tank in front or?

1627
01:07:46,519 --> 01:07:47,960
Auto, auto mine in front.

1628
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:49,159
Yeah, but I already fucked that up.

1629
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:51,079
Put it in the front.

1630
01:07:51,079 --> 01:07:52,599
Auto pick up in front.

1631
01:07:52,599 --> 01:07:53,000
All right.

1632
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,199
Auto pick up in front.

1633
01:07:54,199 --> 01:07:55,000
And then the capacity.

1634
01:07:56,039 --> 01:07:57,809
By the way, you can only have five pieces.

1635
01:07:57,809 --> 01:07:58,929
So be aware of that.

1636
01:07:58,929 --> 01:08:00,610
We've now cannot add anything else.

1637
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:01,090
Crap.

1638
01:08:01,090 --> 01:08:01,409
Really?

1639
01:08:01,969 --> 01:08:03,010
Five out of five wagons.

1640
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:09,030
Mine front, pick back.

1641
01:08:09,670 --> 01:08:11,349
Well, that's what I was thinking, but apparently not.

1642
01:08:12,389 --> 01:08:16,659
Uh, where's the tools?

1643
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:17,859
Right in here.

1644
01:08:18,659 --> 01:08:20,340
It's all wood.

1645
01:08:20,899 --> 01:08:22,100
Yeah, it's all wood.

1646
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:24,420
Uh, go backwards and start getting their stone on the ground.

1647
01:08:25,779 --> 01:08:28,739
I can't go up here.

1648
01:08:28,739 --> 01:08:30,340
How do you fuel the auto pickup?

1649
01:08:30,979 --> 01:08:32,180
Uh, auto pick up his wood.

1650
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:34,159
I can't go back there.

1651
01:08:34,159 --> 01:08:35,439
Uh, auto mine it.

1652
01:08:35,439 --> 01:08:45,750
Where's the, uh, we're about to lose already.

1653
01:08:46,630 --> 01:08:47,430
We're good.

1654
01:08:47,430 --> 01:08:51,350
Just don't, uh, yeah, free him and bring the bucket.

1655
01:08:53,649 --> 01:08:54,449
Already nighttime.

1656
01:08:55,729 --> 01:08:57,970
We're dead.

1657
01:08:57,970 --> 01:08:58,930
We don't have any stone.

1658
01:08:59,729 --> 01:09:02,050
We have tracks in the back that no one picked up.

1659
01:09:02,050 --> 01:09:03,090
Oh, we're fine.

1660
01:09:03,090 --> 01:09:03,489
We're fine.

1661
01:09:03,489 --> 01:09:03,970
We're good.

1662
01:09:03,970 --> 01:09:06,310
Give him some swirls.

1663
01:09:06,869 --> 01:09:08,229
Well, if you give him some swirls, then we.

1664
01:09:09,829 --> 01:09:13,159
How do we get to the back now?

1665
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:16,039
Uh, that's a you guys problem.

1666
01:09:16,039 --> 01:09:17,560
Oh, no, it's an us problem.

1667
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:19,000
Just keep, just walk around.

1668
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:20,920
It looked like it was abstract.

1669
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:23,640
Track, track, track, track, track, track, track, track.

1670
01:09:28,819 --> 01:09:30,100
It's really dark and scary.

1671
01:09:35,399 --> 01:09:35,960
Great.

1672
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:36,520
Two by two.

1673
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:37,399
Should we go straight or up?

1674
01:09:38,199 --> 01:09:41,829
We have to go, uh, let's see what happens if we go up.

1675
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:43,350
Yeah, we're going to buy two.

1676
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:45,189
Two by two.

1677
01:09:45,189 --> 01:09:46,069
We need wood.

1678
01:09:46,069 --> 01:09:47,510
That's you need the two by two.

1679
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:49,430
Jeremy, you need the two by two.

1680
01:09:49,430 --> 01:09:51,270
You need to turn around and free us.

1681
01:09:52,069 --> 01:09:52,869
Take right here.

1682
01:09:57,159 --> 01:09:57,640
Faster.

1683
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:01,159
Got it.

1684
01:10:02,119 --> 01:10:03,319
Then bring stone immediately.

1685
01:10:05,039 --> 01:10:07,359
Bring stone immediately.

1686
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:08,930
I mean, now what?

1687
01:10:09,649 --> 01:10:13,239
Uh, two by two.

1688
01:10:13,239 --> 01:10:14,199
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

1689
01:10:15,239 --> 01:10:16,039
You're nudging me.

1690
01:10:20,739 --> 01:10:21,460
You're pushing me.

1691
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:25,539
Are you going to file a lawsuit because I like flicked your ear?

1692
01:10:25,539 --> 01:10:26,039
What?

1693
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:27,720
I'm coming with track.

1694
01:10:30,010 --> 01:10:31,609
Are we, we're going around?

1695
01:10:31,609 --> 01:10:35,829
I would, I just, I would just, I get, why are you doing that?

1696
01:10:35,829 --> 01:10:36,710
We don't have any trees.

1697
01:10:38,069 --> 01:10:38,789
Are there any trees up here?

1698
01:10:38,789 --> 01:10:39,590
Trees.

1699
01:10:39,590 --> 01:10:40,789
What do you need to this stuff?

1700
01:10:40,789 --> 01:10:41,430
Where am I?

1701
01:10:41,430 --> 01:10:42,710
Right here, right here, right here, right here.

1702
01:10:42,710 --> 01:10:43,430
You need something.

1703
01:10:43,430 --> 01:10:44,470
Someone come get the bucket.

1704
01:10:45,430 --> 01:10:46,069
Where's the bucket?

1705
01:10:47,270 --> 01:10:48,710
It's way back there, but we have to.

1706
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:50,789
Thank God we can see.

1707
01:10:50,789 --> 01:10:51,109
All right.

1708
01:10:53,260 --> 01:10:55,180
We need, uh, we're going up.

1709
01:10:55,180 --> 01:10:56,460
I'm going to, uh, chopping wood.

1710
01:10:57,100 --> 01:10:57,739
We need wood.

1711
01:10:58,300 --> 01:10:59,020
The woods up here.

1712
01:10:59,819 --> 01:11:03,699
Wood by me.

1713
01:11:07,270 --> 01:11:08,310
I need this bucket moved.

1714
01:11:12,090 --> 01:11:13,210
You can just put it down, right?

1715
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:15,210
No, I have to place the track.

1716
01:11:16,090 --> 01:11:20,840
Ooh, that's a tight squeeze.

1717
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:22,359
That's, is that going to bump?

1718
01:11:22,359 --> 01:11:22,840
No.

1719
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:29,960
Look at what the autominer is doing.

1720
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:30,760
It's doing so well.

1721
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:31,800
We need wood.

1722
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:33,159
It's all up here, all up by me.

1723
01:11:33,159 --> 01:11:34,119
There's like a thousand of it.

1724
01:11:35,510 --> 01:11:36,390
I think this is it.

1725
01:11:36,949 --> 01:11:38,149
I think this is it.

1726
01:11:38,149 --> 01:11:38,710
This is not it.

1727
01:11:40,420 --> 01:11:40,979
This is it.

1728
01:11:43,399 --> 01:11:45,000
No, we only, we just, we lost the engine.

1729
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,039
That's all right.

1730
01:11:46,039 --> 01:11:47,479
It's going faster now.

1731
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:48,840
It is.

1732
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:49,960
Just stand in front of it.

1733
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:50,680
Stand in front of it.

1734
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:53,560
All right.

1735
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:54,600
We start from checkpoint.

1736
01:12:00,630 --> 01:12:01,750
That was hard.

1737
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:02,470
That one was hard.

1738
01:12:02,470 --> 01:12:03,350
That was zigzags.

1739
01:12:03,989 --> 01:12:06,680
It was like someone said in all capitals,

1740
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:08,520
this is what we get for wasting the autominer.

1741
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:10,220
That's true.

1742
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:11,260
It is.

1743
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:14,220
We could have had autominer once,

1744
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:16,859
auto collector right behind it.

1745
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:18,539
Do we get to start a checkpoint?

1746
01:12:18,539 --> 01:12:19,899
And why are we stuck at connecting?

1747
01:12:20,619 --> 01:12:21,979
Yeah, I'm stuck at connecting too.

1748
01:12:22,779 --> 01:12:23,819
Star, are you like all tapped?

1749
01:12:28,069 --> 01:12:29,350
Reach, reach off from zero.

1750
01:12:31,670 --> 01:12:32,630
Was this not even the,

1751
01:12:32,630 --> 01:12:34,229
we didn't even finish the first biome?

1752
01:12:35,109 --> 01:12:35,909
No, we did not.

1753
01:12:35,909 --> 01:12:37,350
Save it at last checkpoint.

1754
01:12:37,350 --> 01:12:37,590
What?

1755
01:12:39,159 --> 01:12:40,760
We didn't even finish the first biome.

1756
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:43,020
Okay.

1757
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:45,020
Now it's like six hours past my bedtime.

1758
01:12:45,819 --> 01:12:47,979
I just had an insane deja vu right now.

1759
01:12:50,250 --> 01:12:51,050
This is the same map.

1760
01:12:52,649 --> 01:12:53,899
All right.

1761
01:12:53,899 --> 01:12:54,939
We'll clean it up.

1762
01:12:54,939 --> 01:12:55,899
This is the same seat.

1763
01:12:55,899 --> 01:12:57,180
So you want everything identical?

1764
01:12:57,180 --> 01:12:58,300
Do you want RNG fun?

1765
01:12:58,300 --> 01:12:59,659
Do RNG fun?

1766
01:12:59,659 --> 01:13:01,340
Well, that's why I left last time

1767
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:02,460
and everyone yelled at me.

1768
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:04,220
Well, I thought there was a different checkpoint.

1769
01:13:06,819 --> 01:13:07,140
All right.

1770
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:07,939
RNG fun.

1771
01:13:07,939 --> 01:13:10,739
Guys, the train needs to be upgraded to save the game.

1772
01:13:10,739 --> 01:13:12,260
We need to do the four on the new.

1773
01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:13,460
That's how you get to a new area.

1774
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:15,380
Oh, is it?

1775
01:13:15,380 --> 01:13:16,020
Uh-huh.

1776
01:13:18,279 --> 01:13:18,520
Yep.

1777
01:13:19,239 --> 01:13:24,460
Tied in the tutorial.

1778
01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:28,380
All right.

1779
01:13:28,380 --> 01:13:30,300
Well, what do you guys want to do?

1780
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:31,180
You want to give it another go?

1781
01:13:31,899 --> 01:13:32,939
I want to eat dinner.

1782
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:34,619
One more.

1783
01:13:35,260 --> 01:13:36,380
One more real attempt.

1784
01:13:39,130 --> 01:13:39,449
Right?

1785
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:42,420
Look, hey, just order whatever you want.

1786
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:44,100
Put it on my fucking cart.

1787
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:45,300
I'm not ordering dinner.

1788
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:46,579
That's irresponsible.

1789
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:51,300
I want to do one more.

1790
01:13:53,659 --> 01:13:55,500
One more could be like three hours.

1791
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:55,739
No.

1792
01:13:55,739 --> 01:13:56,460
If we get good.

1793
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:57,739
Yeah.

1794
01:13:58,380 --> 01:13:59,859
They'd get good.

1795
01:14:02,470 --> 01:14:03,510
I don't want to walk over there too.

1796
01:14:03,510 --> 01:14:05,350
Because this is his opportunity to leave.

1797
01:14:07,739 --> 01:14:08,779
Are you always just playing?

1798
01:14:08,779 --> 01:14:10,619
We just did one more and you died in this tutorial.

1799
01:14:13,319 --> 01:14:13,960
You think we're really going to go three hours?

1800
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:15,479
I don't want to redo the lobby.

1801
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:17,640
That's what it is.

1802
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:19,000
He doesn't want to do the lobby again.

1803
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:19,880
Well, come over here.

1804
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:20,119
Come on.

1805
01:14:20,119 --> 01:14:20,520
Come over.

1806
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:21,000
Come on.

1807
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:21,319
Let's go.

1808
01:14:21,319 --> 01:14:21,640
Let's go.

1809
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:21,960
Let's go.

1810
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:22,279
Let's hurry.

1811
01:14:22,279 --> 01:14:23,079
Let's fucking hurry.

1812
01:14:24,039 --> 01:14:27,159
He doesn't want to type the five-character code.

1813
01:14:27,159 --> 01:14:27,880
Just let him eat.

1814
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,720
I'm saying just eat whatever you want.

1815
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:32,760
Well, speaking of, the five-letter code is right there.

1816
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:34,520
The five-letter code has been leaked.

1817
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:37,979
So I hit BRB.

1818
01:14:39,020 --> 01:14:39,659
Sex.

1819
01:14:39,659 --> 01:14:40,060
Facts.

1820
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:44,489
Go.

1821
01:14:45,770 --> 01:14:46,329
Does it matter?

1822
01:14:46,329 --> 01:14:47,130
Or do we not even care?

1823
01:14:47,130 --> 01:14:47,449
Go.

1824
01:14:47,449 --> 01:14:48,090
Go.

1825
01:14:48,090 --> 01:14:49,210
It's already leaked.

1826
01:14:49,210 --> 01:14:49,449
Go.

1827
01:14:55,449 --> 01:14:56,090
Sex fact.

1828
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:02,680
This is the one.

1829
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:04,279
All right.

1830
01:15:04,279 --> 01:15:06,760
We got some awkward initial stone.

1831
01:15:18,069 --> 01:15:18,710
Just once.

1832
01:15:19,510 --> 01:15:21,590
Two by two.

1833
01:15:21,590 --> 01:15:22,069
Two by two.

1834
01:15:22,069 --> 01:15:22,310
German.

1835
01:15:22,310 --> 01:15:22,710
Two by two.

1836
01:15:22,710 --> 01:15:23,109
Two by two.

1837
01:15:23,109 --> 01:15:23,350
German.

1838
01:15:23,350 --> 01:15:24,310
Two by two.

1839
01:15:24,310 --> 01:15:26,310
To be fair, you were not doing two by two.

1840
01:15:28,789 --> 01:15:31,689
Well, that's why I need someone to tell me.

1841
01:15:35,609 --> 01:15:36,729
No, I wasn't.

1842
01:15:36,729 --> 01:15:40,170
I was simply trying to do an impression of one of you two speaking.

1843
01:15:42,250 --> 01:15:47,989
Are we just going to go straight?

1844
01:15:47,989 --> 01:15:49,189
What are we doing here?

1845
01:15:49,270 --> 01:15:52,869
I think straight's probably because straight is more resources.

1846
01:15:53,989 --> 01:15:56,630
If you can't fit the things, just make a wood stack next to it.

1847
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:04,890
Yeah, if we just go straight, the thing is over there.

1848
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:10,699
Just don't forget about those enemies.

1849
01:16:10,699 --> 01:16:11,020
Wait.

1850
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:11,739
No, we have to kill them.

1851
01:16:12,970 --> 01:16:15,130
Keep your commodities safe from bandits.

1852
01:16:15,689 --> 01:16:16,810
Yeah, they're stealing our stuff.

1853
01:16:17,529 --> 01:16:19,319
Just smash them.

1854
01:16:20,279 --> 01:16:23,800
Well, as we know, property is more valuable than human lives.

1855
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:24,359
So kill them.

1856
01:16:24,359 --> 01:16:25,560
Okay, we need to dig straight.

1857
01:16:38,359 --> 01:16:39,079
Where's the bucket?

1858
01:16:40,979 --> 01:16:41,699
Where is the bucket?

1859
01:16:41,699 --> 01:16:42,500
Where's the bucket?

1860
01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:45,000
I haven't seen a bucket.

1861
01:16:47,609 --> 01:16:48,010
Where is the bucket?

1862
01:16:48,010 --> 01:16:48,569
Get there quick.

1863
01:16:48,569 --> 01:16:49,130
Get there quick.

1864
01:16:49,130 --> 01:16:49,689
Get there quick.

1865
01:16:49,689 --> 01:16:50,729
Just get there quick.

1866
01:16:50,729 --> 01:16:53,619
Straight line before it burns.

1867
01:16:54,500 --> 01:17:02,600
Two by two, German.

1868
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:03,239
Two by two.

1869
01:17:03,239 --> 01:17:04,359
It doesn't matter.

1870
01:17:04,359 --> 01:17:05,000
We just have to go.

1871
01:17:06,039 --> 01:17:11,619
Let's not be doing it anymore.

1872
01:17:12,340 --> 01:17:16,180
Yeah, because as soon as you place down the last track, we got it.

1873
01:17:16,180 --> 01:17:17,220
Is that a dinosaur?

1874
01:17:17,220 --> 01:17:18,020
All right, we're done.

1875
01:17:18,020 --> 01:17:19,060
Where?

1876
01:17:19,060 --> 01:17:19,699
Yeah, place it.

1877
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:24,859
There's a dinosaur where the pickaxe is.

1878
01:17:27,050 --> 01:17:28,329
There is a dinosaur.

1879
01:17:28,329 --> 01:17:29,770
Is that a new character?

1880
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:31,529
No, someone joined because it was public.

1881
01:17:32,409 --> 01:17:33,609
Well, it is a new character then.

1882
01:17:34,329 --> 01:17:35,369
Wait, somebody's in the game?

1883
01:17:36,090 --> 01:17:37,369
Yeah, somebody's in the game.

1884
01:17:39,539 --> 01:17:40,180
Well, hey.

1885
01:17:40,180 --> 01:17:41,380
Lucky chat member.

1886
01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:42,819
Somebody got in.

1887
01:17:45,779 --> 01:17:47,220
Well, hey, a fourth person.

1888
01:17:47,220 --> 01:17:48,500
This just like helps.

1889
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:49,699
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

1890
01:17:50,739 --> 01:17:51,859
There's no money to spend.

1891
01:17:51,859 --> 01:17:53,380
You guys just fucking dilly dally.

1892
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:55,560
I got to eat dinner.

1893
01:17:56,199 --> 01:17:57,479
Hey, whatever.

1894
01:17:57,479 --> 01:17:59,640
This is just like a major league baseball mascot.

1895
01:18:04,060 --> 01:18:05,739
They're going to be like so helpful.

1896
01:18:05,739 --> 01:18:06,220
I know.

1897
01:18:06,220 --> 01:18:07,899
Well, we shouldn't even be upset about this.

1898
01:18:09,739 --> 01:18:11,260
Yeah, until he doesn't two by two.

1899
01:18:12,380 --> 01:18:13,260
He's not.

1900
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:15,899
Do you think they get the dinosaur costume without two by twoing?

1901
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:19,289
I think it's random.

1902
01:18:19,289 --> 01:18:21,289
I think you can just pick any costume.

1903
01:18:22,090 --> 01:18:26,500
Can't mind the stone.

1904
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:28,979
Should we just go straight?

1905
01:18:30,739 --> 01:18:32,340
Well, let's go down.

1906
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:36,039
Well, Dingo, the dinosaur wants us to go this way.

1907
01:18:36,039 --> 01:18:37,000
So that's where we're going.

1908
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:41,500
Is that M doing this?

1909
01:18:47,659 --> 01:18:49,579
Which I believe this one.

1910
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:56,979
Yeah, our Sims 3 entrance mascot is going to help us out here.

1911
01:18:57,779 --> 01:19:02,119
Not Sims 3, go across to Tycoon 3.

1912
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:12,600
I could have fucking just called that guy in Germany

1913
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:13,720
and got him to play with him.

1914
01:19:15,699 --> 01:19:16,180
Yeah, but then.

1915
01:19:18,869 --> 01:19:19,430
Then what?

1916
01:19:20,149 --> 01:19:24,390
Well, I don't want to say, but then you end up with Dev in call,

1917
01:19:24,390 --> 01:19:27,109
who is like, all right, and the other features we've got here,

1918
01:19:27,109 --> 01:19:29,270
there are 17 different characters.

1919
01:19:29,270 --> 01:19:30,069
You don't call him.

1920
01:19:30,069 --> 01:19:31,029
You guys haven't been paying attention.

1921
01:19:31,029 --> 01:19:32,069
He already got the bolt.

1922
01:19:33,430 --> 01:19:35,380
Look it.

1923
01:19:35,380 --> 01:19:36,579
I saw that.

1924
01:19:36,579 --> 01:19:37,140
Did you, though?

1925
01:19:37,859 --> 01:19:38,100
Yeah.

1926
01:19:39,060 --> 01:19:43,020
Stuck on this tree.

1927
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:44,060
What if this is the Dev?

1928
01:19:46,250 --> 01:19:47,210
This is playing like a Dev.

1929
01:19:47,210 --> 01:19:50,250
Because he has like common sense is like he's too smart.

1930
01:19:50,329 --> 01:19:51,529
He's just chopping trees.

1931
01:19:51,529 --> 01:19:53,449
You know, it's, it's called keeping your head down.

1932
01:19:54,489 --> 01:20:01,000
We're going, we're going too slow.

1933
01:20:03,260 --> 01:20:06,060
The Mario level is not auto scrolling fast enough.

1934
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:07,420
He wants to keep going faster.

1935
01:20:08,699 --> 01:20:17,350
Things aren't building quick enough.

1936
01:20:17,350 --> 01:20:20,710
Yes, because we have a slow ass train.

1937
01:20:21,510 --> 01:20:31,960
Stone, stone.

1938
01:20:33,079 --> 01:20:36,789
This person just took over.

1939
01:20:36,789 --> 01:20:38,390
He's just chopping like a maniac.

1940
01:20:39,109 --> 01:20:40,149
This so good.

1941
01:20:40,149 --> 01:20:42,630
Hey, Star, I hope you know that we probably will be here for three hours

1942
01:20:42,630 --> 01:20:44,789
because we have somebody that actually knows everything.

1943
01:20:44,869 --> 01:20:48,229
Well, now I can leave it down to the three players, which was efficient.

1944
01:20:49,989 --> 01:20:52,729
Let's keep dinosaur mascot.

1945
01:20:54,250 --> 01:20:58,600
That's so fun.

1946
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:00,420
Yeah, we're doing too good.

1947
01:21:03,340 --> 01:21:04,380
We have a surplus.

1948
01:21:05,579 --> 01:21:07,420
There's like a thousand wood, my man.

1949
01:21:07,420 --> 01:21:09,180
What is that extra zig for?

1950
01:21:09,180 --> 01:21:09,979
Look at all this.

1951
01:21:13,100 --> 01:21:14,220
Wait, you want to go that way?

1952
01:21:15,340 --> 01:21:17,100
Oh, we have to go that way.

1953
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:17,659
Oh shit.

1954
01:21:18,619 --> 01:21:19,020
Watch out.

1955
01:21:19,739 --> 01:21:25,369
We've got too many resources.

1956
01:21:26,010 --> 01:21:27,130
Does anyone want to take care of that?

1957
01:21:28,090 --> 01:21:28,590
Fire.

1958
01:21:39,590 --> 01:21:40,869
I love that dinosaur.

1959
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:46,979
I love the animation.

1960
01:21:46,979 --> 01:21:47,939
The animation is the best.

1961
01:21:47,939 --> 01:21:49,779
He just leans back and forth with his head.

1962
01:21:50,659 --> 01:21:57,180
All right.

1963
01:21:57,180 --> 01:21:59,579
This is a pain in the ass level one.

1964
01:21:59,579 --> 01:22:02,699
By the way, we also have to address, we have to address another thing.

1965
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:07,579
Didn't you have the game is unjoinable selected?

1966
01:22:08,539 --> 01:22:10,119
Well, it was no randoms.

1967
01:22:10,119 --> 01:22:11,239
They had the private code.

1968
01:22:12,039 --> 01:22:12,539
Oh.

1969
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:15,960
There's like a random matchmaking as well.

1970
01:22:17,079 --> 01:22:20,539
Well, we got it.

1971
01:22:20,539 --> 01:22:23,880
We got a straightaway here for one second.

1972
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:25,319
I heard the like, don't don't don't don't.

1973
01:22:25,319 --> 01:22:26,359
I thought that was the train.

1974
01:22:26,359 --> 01:22:27,239
You running up the track.

1975
01:22:29,159 --> 01:22:30,119
It is.

1976
01:22:30,119 --> 01:22:32,359
All right, stream viewer.

1977
01:22:33,319 --> 01:22:37,560
If you pick a single upgrade in there immediately, you're dead.

1978
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:38,760
You're dead.

1979
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:41,399
In fact, we probably just let him pick all the upgrades.

1980
01:22:41,399 --> 01:22:43,000
He probably knows the exact placement.

1981
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,520
We should probably just give him our stream key.

1982
01:22:51,479 --> 01:22:52,279
Don't leave us behind.

1983
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:54,229
All right.

1984
01:22:54,229 --> 01:22:55,109
We have four bolts.

1985
01:22:56,630 --> 01:23:05,850
He's like, do this one.

1986
01:23:05,850 --> 01:23:07,850
Auto pick up commodities.

1987
01:23:07,850 --> 01:23:08,329
Maybe this one.

1988
01:23:08,329 --> 01:23:09,930
I like auto pick up commodities.

1989
01:23:10,810 --> 01:23:11,529
This one, I'm good.

1990
01:23:13,609 --> 01:23:13,850
I love this.

1991
01:23:13,850 --> 01:23:16,649
We have so many that we need some stack size too.

1992
01:23:16,649 --> 01:23:20,729
Because we had so many commodities that just four of us.

1993
01:23:21,939 --> 01:23:24,100
Now, the thing is, do these stay or do they come back?

1994
01:23:25,060 --> 01:23:28,579
Oh, I think that's randomly rolling.

1995
01:23:28,579 --> 01:23:30,500
Because if it's random every time, then get it now.

1996
01:23:31,539 --> 01:23:32,069
Yeah.

1997
01:23:32,069 --> 01:23:32,710
Where do we put it?

1998
01:23:33,689 --> 01:23:39,699
If it stays there through the next one, then right in the front.

1999
01:23:40,579 --> 01:23:45,140
Yeah.

2000
01:23:45,140 --> 01:23:47,539
Put it right in the front and then we'll get the auto miner to go.

2001
01:23:47,539 --> 01:23:48,579
Obey the dyno.

2002
01:23:50,819 --> 01:23:54,100
Hey, I'm obeying the dyno.

2003
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:59,449
So the new engine lets us save.

2004
01:24:01,159 --> 01:24:03,319
The new engine means we are at a new place.

2005
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:04,840
Is that we can go.

2006
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:10,279
That's the new biome, which means that allows us to restart from that biome.

2007
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:13,909
Are we going down?

2008
01:24:13,909 --> 01:24:14,390
Who knows?

2009
01:24:14,949 --> 01:24:15,430
I don't know.

2010
01:24:17,590 --> 01:24:17,829
Sure.

2011
01:24:19,590 --> 01:24:22,149
Although this is going right into unmindable territory.

2012
01:24:23,590 --> 01:24:23,909
All right.

2013
01:24:23,909 --> 01:24:26,149
Can you chop to the right?

2014
01:24:26,149 --> 01:24:27,270
Or you have to make a bridge.

2015
01:24:28,149 --> 01:24:29,430
Bridge is necessary.

2016
01:24:31,909 --> 01:24:39,000
It's me dyno.

2017
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:39,800
Please mod me.

2018
01:24:41,239 --> 01:24:55,350
We got stone up ahead.

2019
01:24:57,350 --> 01:24:58,390
Holy shit.

2020
01:24:58,390 --> 01:24:59,590
Look at all that track.

2021
01:24:59,590 --> 01:25:00,550
Where did that even come from?

2022
01:25:03,239 --> 01:25:04,279
We've just been doing it.

2023
01:25:04,279 --> 01:25:07,239
Is this just what happens when you add a fourth player who's also a dinosaur,

2024
01:25:07,239 --> 01:25:08,199
who's also a dev?

2025
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:13,560
What's also like anybody is a warm body and this game doesn't change difficulty based on

2026
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:14,439
how many people are in it.

2027
01:25:17,079 --> 01:25:17,399
Wow.

2028
01:25:17,399 --> 01:25:17,800
Funky.

2029
01:25:19,239 --> 01:25:23,050
So hungry.

2030
01:25:24,329 --> 01:25:26,010
Why don't you eat some of these rocks?

2031
01:25:26,010 --> 01:25:28,090
I haven't seen my wife in days.

2032
01:25:29,210 --> 01:25:30,340
Pete.

2033
01:25:31,060 --> 01:25:37,020
I'm so hungry.

2034
01:25:37,020 --> 01:25:39,260
So, well, I told you just get whatever you want.

2035
01:25:40,220 --> 01:25:41,500
What do you want?

2036
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:41,899
Pizza?

2037
01:25:42,539 --> 01:25:44,220
I want to make my dinner.

2038
01:25:44,220 --> 01:25:44,939
What do you want?

2039
01:25:44,939 --> 01:25:45,340
Pizza?

2040
01:25:46,939 --> 01:25:47,819
What do you kids want today?

2041
01:25:48,460 --> 01:25:49,180
Order me a pizza.

2042
01:25:58,140 --> 01:26:03,779
Where's the wood?

2043
01:26:03,779 --> 01:26:08,140
Oh, where's the wood?

2044
01:26:08,699 --> 01:26:09,659
We need wood to make.

2045
01:26:12,180 --> 01:26:15,619
That's all I've been doing since we've loaded into this level.

2046
01:26:15,619 --> 01:26:16,420
You could do more.

2047
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:24,340
Who's the dino?

2048
01:26:24,340 --> 01:26:24,899
We don't know.

2049
01:26:24,899 --> 01:26:26,020
It's a mystery dino.

2050
01:26:26,659 --> 01:26:27,779
Don't lose that pickaxe.

2051
01:26:29,699 --> 01:26:30,819
Don't lose that pickaxe.

2052
01:26:32,260 --> 01:26:36,300
I mean, you could.

2053
01:26:42,789 --> 01:26:44,149
I think we got enough to finish, right?

2054
01:26:45,350 --> 01:26:49,319
Well, that went very smoothly.

2055
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:51,159
Did we see any secrets, though?

2056
01:26:52,439 --> 01:26:53,640
I think you just got it.

2057
01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:54,680
I think you just got the ball.

2058
01:26:57,829 --> 01:26:59,109
We need the little bridge.

2059
01:27:00,149 --> 01:27:02,100
Little bridge?

2060
01:27:02,100 --> 01:27:02,899
Up top?

2061
01:27:02,899 --> 01:27:04,100
The bridge needs to go up.

2062
01:27:04,819 --> 01:27:05,060
What?

2063
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:08,119
How are we going to connect to this over the water?

2064
01:27:08,119 --> 01:27:09,159
We need a bridge over the water.

2065
01:27:09,159 --> 01:27:09,319
Right.

2066
01:27:09,319 --> 01:27:10,520
There's bamboo shoots.

2067
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:11,000
Oh, fuck.

2068
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:11,399
All right.

2069
01:27:11,399 --> 01:27:11,720
We're good.

2070
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:11,960
We're good.

2071
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:12,199
We're good.

2072
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:13,560
Right here.

2073
01:27:14,199 --> 01:27:15,479
Look at this damn dino.

2074
01:27:15,479 --> 01:27:15,960
Look at that.

2075
01:27:17,260 --> 01:27:18,060
I'm just watching.

2076
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:18,300
All right.

2077
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:19,260
I'm going to have to do something.

2078
01:27:19,260 --> 01:27:21,260
Just there's wood right here.

2079
01:27:21,260 --> 01:27:21,819
Just do it.

2080
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:29,909
I get it.

2081
01:27:29,909 --> 01:27:33,430
I'm going to say I really don't think it takes a developer to connect point A to point B.

2082
01:27:35,189 --> 01:27:36,550
That's not how this goes.

2083
01:27:36,550 --> 01:27:37,750
I chop wood.

2084
01:27:38,550 --> 01:27:39,350
That's not where this goes.

2085
01:27:40,390 --> 01:27:45,239
I'm going to mine a rock quick.

2086
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:52,579
This one?

2087
01:27:52,579 --> 01:27:53,699
Autominer.

2088
01:27:53,699 --> 01:27:53,939
Me.

2089
01:27:55,399 --> 01:27:55,880
No me.

2090
01:27:56,840 --> 01:27:59,560
I'm just having fun watching the Dinosaur play.

2091
01:28:00,279 --> 01:28:02,069
What about this thing?

2092
01:28:03,430 --> 01:28:04,789
We can't have any more.

2093
01:28:04,789 --> 01:28:06,149
Converts wood to iron.

2094
01:28:06,149 --> 01:28:06,710
Oh, that's it.

2095
01:28:06,710 --> 01:28:06,949
Yeah.

2096
01:28:07,590 --> 01:28:07,989
No more.

2097
01:28:07,989 --> 01:28:08,310
That's it.

2098
01:28:11,180 --> 01:28:11,659
No more.

2099
01:28:11,659 --> 01:28:12,380
That's it.

2100
01:28:12,380 --> 01:28:12,859
No more.

2101
01:28:12,859 --> 01:28:13,180
That's it.

2102
01:28:13,180 --> 01:28:14,140
It's five out of five.

2103
01:28:15,100 --> 01:28:18,869
How am I not standing in the square?

2104
01:28:18,869 --> 01:28:19,510
I thought I was.

2105
01:28:21,460 --> 01:28:22,180
That guy stood in it.

2106
01:28:22,180 --> 01:28:23,060
He must have been a dev.

2107
01:28:23,779 --> 01:28:26,579
Okay.

2108
01:28:27,460 --> 01:28:29,270
You joke out.

2109
01:28:29,270 --> 01:28:30,149
Get your jokes out.

2110
01:28:30,949 --> 01:28:32,659
They're funny.

2111
01:28:32,659 --> 01:28:33,460
They're really funny.

2112
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:36,100
Although they can sometimes be hurtful to me.

2113
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:39,319
All right.

2114
01:28:39,319 --> 01:28:42,680
So autominer boy is on and auto collector is on at the same time.

2115
01:28:43,479 --> 01:28:44,760
That's pretty good.

2116
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:45,640
Let's see what happened.

2117
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:46,840
Are we just going straight or what?

2118
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:50,550
I guess so.

2119
01:28:50,550 --> 01:28:51,750
Oh, there's a golden nugget.

2120
01:28:52,310 --> 01:28:52,710
Where is it?

2121
01:28:55,590 --> 01:29:05,420
I'm going to put this all the way over here because I know we're not.

2122
01:29:05,420 --> 01:29:06,859
No one's going to remember that's over there.

2123
01:29:07,819 --> 01:29:10,300
Uh, the auto collector really does chew through wood.

2124
01:29:11,340 --> 01:29:13,619
Uh, where's the X?

2125
01:29:13,619 --> 01:29:14,260
He's going to the X.

2126
01:29:14,260 --> 01:29:22,520
Oh, you do.

2127
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:23,479
Yeah, we have to go down.

2128
01:29:39,829 --> 01:29:40,390
Cool.

2129
01:29:40,390 --> 01:29:42,010
How are we doing?

2130
01:29:42,010 --> 01:29:46,729
We're going to need a two by two pretty soon or the autominer to be powered or both.

2131
01:29:46,729 --> 01:29:48,010
I'm going to call the autominer right now.

2132
01:29:49,130 --> 01:29:51,659
Autominer is on.

2133
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:56,420
I'm going to start.

2134
01:29:56,420 --> 01:29:57,380
We need some stone, right?

2135
01:29:57,380 --> 01:29:58,020
I'm stuck.

2136
01:29:58,020 --> 01:29:58,739
Are we stuck?

2137
01:29:59,779 --> 01:30:03,380
Oh, oh, alert, alert, alert, alert.

2138
01:30:10,550 --> 01:30:12,149
Now we need a miner down here.

2139
01:30:12,149 --> 01:30:13,430
What happened to the two by two?

2140
01:30:13,989 --> 01:30:15,270
I was screamed at.

2141
01:30:15,270 --> 01:30:15,590
I got it.

2142
01:30:15,590 --> 01:30:15,909
I got it.

2143
01:30:15,909 --> 01:30:16,229
I got it.

2144
01:30:16,229 --> 01:30:25,979
Man, get rid of these trees down here.

2145
01:30:26,699 --> 01:30:27,979
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

2146
01:30:33,270 --> 01:30:35,109
How far does the stack boy reach?

2147
01:30:43,130 --> 01:30:45,930
Oh, when you dash them, when they drop their tool, that's what's happening.

2148
01:30:46,729 --> 01:30:48,229
You need tools stolen.

2149
01:30:49,270 --> 01:30:57,260
All right, we need the, uh, we need the axe over here on the right with the cows.

2150
01:30:58,140 --> 01:31:04,779
Okay, you can move the cows away.

2151
01:31:04,779 --> 01:31:07,100
They're just kind of, you can pick them up.

2152
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:08,619
This is causing a boy out of the way.

2153
01:31:15,369 --> 01:31:15,850
So far.

2154
01:31:17,300 --> 01:31:17,779
Pretty good.

2155
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:21,060
Me and Dino just got to cross up.

2156
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:21,539
Did you see that?

2157
01:31:22,340 --> 01:31:23,380
Anyone watching right now?

2158
01:31:23,380 --> 01:31:24,340
Put that in remind.

2159
01:31:24,340 --> 01:31:25,300
We just got crossed up.

2160
01:31:25,300 --> 01:31:25,939
That was crazy.

2161
01:31:27,859 --> 01:31:30,100
I thought he was, uh, me and he thought he was him.

2162
01:31:31,529 --> 01:31:32,489
I'm stuck.

2163
01:31:32,489 --> 01:31:46,420
Don't lose me.

2164
01:31:46,420 --> 01:31:48,260
We are down to the final piece.

2165
01:31:48,260 --> 01:31:49,460
Oh, we're stuck back here.

2166
01:31:49,460 --> 01:31:51,380
Alert, how do we do the, how do we do the alert button?

2167
01:31:51,380 --> 01:31:52,180
How do I do that?

2168
01:31:52,180 --> 01:31:52,979
I want to do that too.

2169
01:31:53,699 --> 01:31:54,180
Let's alert.

2170
01:31:54,180 --> 01:31:54,739
Great trigger.

2171
01:31:56,020 --> 01:31:59,609
I think I'll be able to save you.

2172
01:32:01,130 --> 01:32:02,970
Uh, yeah, we need to, we need to access.

2173
01:32:07,479 --> 01:32:08,520
Uh, also fire.

2174
01:32:09,159 --> 01:32:12,439
Also we are, did we get the key thing?

2175
01:32:13,079 --> 01:32:13,319
Yeah.

2176
01:32:13,319 --> 01:32:14,279
He's got the last thing.

2177
01:32:14,279 --> 01:32:14,439
Yeah.

2178
01:32:15,319 --> 01:32:19,560
Destroy no animals.

2179
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:20,039
We got it.

2180
01:32:21,899 --> 01:32:24,300
Do we get, um, by the way.

2181
01:32:24,300 --> 01:32:25,579
Now we can only do upgrades.

2182
01:32:25,579 --> 01:32:28,060
So we should probably get the new engine eventually, right?

2183
01:32:28,060 --> 01:32:30,779
We really should do the quest thing that pops up.

2184
01:32:30,779 --> 01:32:33,020
Cause I think we just got two bolts for doing that.

2185
01:32:34,140 --> 01:32:35,180
What was the quest?

2186
01:32:35,180 --> 01:32:36,460
It was don't hit, kill any animals.

2187
01:32:36,460 --> 01:32:37,979
So don't do anything to animals.

2188
01:32:38,060 --> 01:32:39,180
We just got like a boat for that.

2189
01:32:39,180 --> 01:32:43,079
I think upgrade the auto-mining speed.

2190
01:32:46,899 --> 01:32:51,699
Oh, the engine lets you have more wagons.

2191
01:32:52,260 --> 01:32:54,819
Should we just wait?

2192
01:32:59,579 --> 01:32:59,899
Yeah.

2193
01:33:02,810 --> 01:33:03,210
Yeah.

2194
01:33:03,210 --> 01:33:04,890
That's all about that auto-miner life.

2195
01:33:09,380 --> 01:33:10,100
Key.

2196
01:33:10,100 --> 01:33:12,199
All right.

2197
01:33:12,199 --> 01:33:13,880
Pick roles, pick roles, pick roles here.

2198
01:33:17,399 --> 01:33:21,829
No, uh, we need stone or else we're dead.

2199
01:33:21,829 --> 01:33:23,510
Like we know.

2200
01:33:31,909 --> 01:33:33,350
There's a lot over here.

2201
01:33:33,350 --> 01:33:34,710
Well, do you want to put one down or?

2202
01:33:34,710 --> 01:33:35,270
No, I got it.

2203
01:33:35,989 --> 01:33:36,789
Auto-miner is on.

2204
01:33:37,430 --> 01:33:39,800
Which way are we going?

2205
01:33:40,439 --> 01:33:55,189
Don't lose these tracks with me.

2206
01:33:57,100 --> 01:33:57,899
I need more track.

2207
01:33:58,779 --> 01:33:59,340
It's right there.

2208
01:34:00,550 --> 01:34:02,869
Well, someone didn't finish mining that all the way.

2209
01:34:02,869 --> 01:34:04,069
So we might just lose.

2210
01:34:04,869 --> 01:34:05,590
Track is right here.

2211
01:34:06,310 --> 01:34:12,710
Don't leave that bucket.

2212
01:34:13,750 --> 01:34:14,390
Don't you do it.

2213
01:34:14,390 --> 01:34:15,590
I know you, you right there.

2214
01:34:15,590 --> 01:34:16,149
You're going to leave it.

2215
01:34:16,149 --> 01:34:16,710
I know you were.

2216
01:34:17,350 --> 01:34:18,020
All right.

2217
01:34:18,020 --> 01:34:19,060
We're about to get the ball all stuck.

2218
01:34:19,060 --> 01:34:20,020
We have a little tools up here, right?

2219
01:34:21,060 --> 01:34:23,819
Take your way over here.

2220
01:34:24,619 --> 01:34:27,899
Both of, uh, both of them all become stuck.

2221
01:34:27,899 --> 01:34:29,260
Thank God for the auto-miner.

2222
01:34:30,140 --> 01:34:40,260
Miner level two.

2223
01:34:40,260 --> 01:34:41,060
We're going up, right?

2224
01:34:42,020 --> 01:34:42,819
Are we going straight?

2225
01:34:42,819 --> 01:34:43,060
Yeah.

2226
01:34:43,699 --> 01:34:47,779
Uh, off or right?

2227
01:34:47,779 --> 01:34:48,180
Straight.

2228
01:34:56,649 --> 01:34:57,130
There you go.

2229
01:34:59,020 --> 01:35:01,500
Look at the auto-miner leveling the land.

2230
01:35:01,500 --> 01:35:02,300
Oh, it's crazy.

2231
01:35:03,420 --> 01:35:07,670
Stuck on this side.

2232
01:35:08,789 --> 01:35:11,899
All right.

2233
01:35:11,899 --> 01:35:14,300
What we got for, uh, that pickaxe.

2234
01:35:16,539 --> 01:35:18,630
That means there's a secret up top.

2235
01:35:18,630 --> 01:35:19,189
Oh shit.

2236
01:35:19,189 --> 01:35:19,590
Secret.

2237
01:35:20,390 --> 01:35:20,869
Probably.

2238
01:35:27,829 --> 01:35:29,590
We need wood to build a bridge up here.

2239
01:35:40,060 --> 01:35:41,420
Wood desperately needed up front.

2240
01:35:42,060 --> 01:35:49,100
Am I finishing it?

2241
01:35:49,739 --> 01:35:53,180
Uh, is there any, I think, I think we're about to go look for the bolt.

2242
01:35:53,180 --> 01:35:54,140
It might be a bolt up there.

2243
01:35:54,140 --> 01:35:54,939
Put these over here too.

2244
01:35:54,939 --> 01:35:57,180
So we get extra, uh, crack.

2245
01:35:59,100 --> 01:36:00,779
Is it up there?

2246
01:36:00,779 --> 01:36:01,180
Okay.

2247
01:36:01,180 --> 01:36:02,619
I think you just got to finish it.

2248
01:36:02,619 --> 01:36:02,859
Okay.

2249
01:36:02,859 --> 01:36:03,359
Okay.

2250
01:36:04,380 --> 01:36:04,779
I know.

2251
01:36:04,779 --> 01:36:09,479
Already got bolt about the secret.

2252
01:36:10,279 --> 01:36:11,800
Dude, we're going to be good to go next time.

2253
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:12,119
Look at that.

2254
01:36:12,119 --> 01:36:13,239
It's dark out.

2255
01:36:13,239 --> 01:36:14,279
Should we just get the new engine?

2256
01:36:16,659 --> 01:36:16,979
Yeah.

2257
01:36:17,939 --> 01:36:18,659
New engine?

2258
01:36:18,659 --> 01:36:20,819
Or I mean, we have so many materials.

2259
01:36:20,819 --> 01:36:25,699
We just don't have big enough stack sizes or just get auto-miner.

2260
01:36:25,699 --> 01:36:27,220
We have materials everywhere.

2261
01:36:27,220 --> 01:36:31,779
I don't know if auto-mining better is going to help as much as stacking bigger.

2262
01:36:32,739 --> 01:36:33,939
Auto-mine.

2263
01:36:34,899 --> 01:36:35,460
Let's do it.

2264
01:36:35,460 --> 01:36:35,779
All right.

2265
01:36:35,779 --> 01:36:38,420
Auto-miner and the upgrade of that thing.

2266
01:36:38,420 --> 01:36:41,300
And then we'll do the, yeah.

2267
01:36:42,739 --> 01:36:42,899
Yeah.

2268
01:36:42,899 --> 01:36:44,100
Then we'll do the train next round.

2269
01:36:44,739 --> 01:36:47,699
Did you just get two auto-miner upgrades?

2270
01:36:47,699 --> 01:36:49,220
We got auto-miner and auto-picker.

2271
01:36:49,220 --> 01:36:50,180
Auto-pickup and auto-miner.

2272
01:36:52,010 --> 01:36:52,569
Yeah.

2273
01:36:52,569 --> 01:36:54,329
This thing's going to just chew.

2274
01:36:54,329 --> 01:36:56,890
We got like level one hold resources.

2275
01:36:57,930 --> 01:36:59,289
It'll just chew through everything.

2276
01:36:59,289 --> 01:37:03,270
We just need, we just got to survive.

2277
01:37:03,270 --> 01:37:04,229
Look at all this track we have.

2278
01:37:04,229 --> 01:37:04,710
Are you kidding me?

2279
01:37:04,710 --> 01:37:06,470
This is like, we are, we just started on easy mode.

2280
01:37:08,409 --> 01:37:12,010
Because apparently if you take the track off before it ends, it doesn't disappear.

2281
01:37:13,210 --> 01:37:23,270
Make sure you keep it.

2282
01:37:23,270 --> 01:37:24,550
Don't leave anything.

2283
01:37:25,689 --> 01:37:26,010
All right.

2284
01:37:26,010 --> 01:37:26,649
Where are we off to?

2285
01:37:27,850 --> 01:37:31,609
The problem is auto-miner can reach like twice as far as auto-picker.

2286
01:37:33,239 --> 01:37:34,039
That's better.

2287
01:37:34,039 --> 01:37:34,600
Holy shit.

2288
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:35,800
It is destroying everything.

2289
01:37:36,439 --> 01:37:39,960
So if you upgrade them at the same time, you're not getting max value out of both.

2290
01:37:41,319 --> 01:37:45,800
Well, those cows.

2291
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:46,920
There are cows in here, right?

2292
01:37:47,880 --> 01:37:52,439
Straight across.

2293
01:37:54,010 --> 01:37:55,289
I think straight is the way to go.

2294
01:37:57,529 --> 01:37:58,329
Hope so.

2295
01:37:58,329 --> 01:37:58,489
Yeah.

2296
01:37:58,489 --> 01:38:00,250
He's, he's going up the bolt.

2297
01:38:00,250 --> 01:38:00,649
Oops.

2298
01:38:00,649 --> 01:38:01,369
He's doing bolt.

2299
01:38:02,409 --> 01:38:03,819
He can't get those materials.

2300
01:38:04,779 --> 01:38:07,939
I mean, this is, this is easier.

2301
01:38:09,460 --> 01:38:13,880
Just make sure we get tracks placed down ahead of time because we're about to be.

2302
01:38:14,680 --> 01:38:14,920
Okay.

2303
01:38:14,920 --> 01:38:17,399
We need a wood.

2304
01:38:17,399 --> 01:38:19,800
This, this station's right here though.

2305
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:20,600
What?

2306
01:38:20,600 --> 01:38:22,359
Hey, Dino's not available.

2307
01:38:23,479 --> 01:38:25,159
Dino's taking us the wrong way.

2308
01:38:25,159 --> 01:38:26,359
Actually right now.

2309
01:38:26,359 --> 01:38:27,720
I mean, why did you listen to the stir maker?

2310
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:30,359
Wait, I thought we were going to the right.

2311
01:38:31,319 --> 01:38:31,800
We were.

2312
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:33,239
Dino moved all the train tracks.

2313
01:38:33,239 --> 01:38:33,560
It's all right.

2314
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:34,039
It's okay.

2315
01:38:34,039 --> 01:38:35,319
We, we, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2316
01:38:35,319 --> 01:38:35,720
This is safe.

2317
01:38:35,720 --> 01:38:36,119
This is fine.

2318
01:38:36,119 --> 01:38:36,920
This is fine.

2319
01:38:36,920 --> 01:38:37,239
Okay.

2320
01:38:37,239 --> 01:38:38,359
I'm on to you.

2321
01:38:38,359 --> 01:38:39,079
I'm on to you.

2322
01:38:39,079 --> 01:38:41,239
Tracks, tracks, tracks, tracks.

2323
01:38:41,239 --> 01:38:42,439
You need tracks.

2324
01:38:42,439 --> 01:38:43,560
Tracks, track, track it up.

2325
01:38:45,609 --> 01:38:46,729
We can connect it down here.

2326
01:38:47,529 --> 01:38:48,550
Everybody slow down.

2327
01:38:48,550 --> 01:38:48,949
We're fine.

2328
01:38:49,909 --> 01:38:54,819
Ay, ya, ya, ya.

2329
01:38:54,819 --> 01:38:55,539
Don't touch a cow.

2330
01:38:56,260 --> 01:38:59,340
Ay, ya, ya.

2331
01:39:00,220 --> 01:39:03,539
Dream.

2332
01:39:03,539 --> 01:39:04,579
I just want to eat dinner.

2333
01:39:05,380 --> 01:39:08,020
And then we take it down.

2334
01:39:08,899 --> 01:39:11,770
So down.

2335
01:39:11,770 --> 01:39:13,210
And then I'm going to start clearing the path here.

2336
01:39:14,170 --> 01:39:23,079
Yeah, we're good.

2337
01:39:23,079 --> 01:39:26,600
But there was, there was some panic there for absolutely no reason.

2338
01:39:27,319 --> 01:39:27,640
Yeah.

2339
01:39:27,640 --> 01:39:29,159
Absolutely none.

2340
01:39:29,159 --> 01:39:30,119
I mean, there was a reason.

2341
01:39:31,079 --> 01:39:31,479
Water.

2342
01:39:31,479 --> 01:39:32,039
For the water.

2343
01:39:32,680 --> 01:39:33,079
Water.

2344
01:39:33,880 --> 01:39:34,600
Was water.

2345
01:39:35,560 --> 01:39:43,720
You got to get two by two.

2346
01:39:43,720 --> 01:39:45,239
There's so much stone.

2347
01:39:46,199 --> 01:39:47,960
The whole mountain's level.

2348
01:39:50,180 --> 01:39:50,420
Yeah.

2349
01:39:50,420 --> 01:39:52,979
I think we could do next engine now.

2350
01:39:54,260 --> 01:39:58,220
We have so many resources.

2351
01:39:58,220 --> 01:39:59,819
We're just like throwing them in the ocean.

2352
01:39:59,819 --> 01:40:01,899
Well, we need like, we need the track builder because

2353
01:40:03,100 --> 01:40:04,859
barely keeping up with the train at this point.

2354
01:40:07,260 --> 01:40:08,779
Yeah, we do need the track builder.

2355
01:40:08,779 --> 01:40:09,500
Look at all this.

2356
01:40:09,500 --> 01:40:11,260
We need the track builder for the storage.

2357
01:40:15,500 --> 01:40:16,220
No bolts, right?

2358
01:40:17,020 --> 01:40:18,810
It's already been gobbled up.

2359
01:40:18,810 --> 01:40:19,210
Let's go.

2360
01:40:20,170 --> 01:40:29,300
Track 200 meters.

2361
01:40:30,180 --> 01:40:30,659
We get it.

2362
01:40:31,380 --> 01:40:34,760
Is there, I think, yeah, we don't.

2363
01:40:34,760 --> 01:40:35,239
Three bolts.

2364
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:38,569
We just have to wait till next round.

2365
01:40:38,569 --> 01:40:38,810
Yeah.

2366
01:40:38,810 --> 01:40:39,689
Just by autominer.

2367
01:40:40,329 --> 01:40:44,409
Let's get the, we've been crafting speed on the planks.

2368
01:40:44,409 --> 01:40:44,890
That's fine.

2369
01:40:44,890 --> 01:40:45,850
We do it anyway.

2370
01:40:46,649 --> 01:40:47,369
What'd you just replace?

2371
01:40:48,500 --> 01:40:51,140
I upgraded the crafting speed of the tracks.

2372
01:40:52,630 --> 01:40:53,670
Dino said no.

2373
01:40:54,470 --> 01:40:55,909
We just went against Dino's wishes.

2374
01:40:56,550 --> 01:40:57,430
Fuck that guy.

2375
01:40:57,430 --> 01:40:57,989
I voted.

2376
01:40:59,029 --> 01:41:00,149
I voted in favor.

2377
01:41:01,029 --> 01:41:09,720
I know why you just said that.

2378
01:41:09,720 --> 01:41:14,789
Because this guy is keeping you from eating dinner because it means we're continuing.

2379
01:41:15,829 --> 01:41:16,579
Nice.

2380
01:41:16,579 --> 01:41:17,060
I understand.

2381
01:41:17,699 --> 01:41:19,699
Oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops.

2382
01:41:20,819 --> 01:41:22,329
All right.

2383
01:41:22,329 --> 01:41:24,329
We need a lot of stone.

2384
01:41:24,329 --> 01:41:24,569
All right.

2385
01:41:24,569 --> 01:41:25,050
We need to go.

2386
01:41:25,770 --> 01:41:26,090
All right.

2387
01:41:26,090 --> 01:41:27,289
We need to move now.

2388
01:41:27,289 --> 01:41:28,329
Like now, now, now, now.

2389
01:41:31,380 --> 01:41:32,180
Get the pickaxe.

2390
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:38,899
No, me.

2391
01:41:40,020 --> 01:41:41,460
We might need to loop the track a bit.

2392
01:41:42,180 --> 01:41:43,060
Now we should be good.

2393
01:41:43,060 --> 01:41:43,859
We have a ton of track.

2394
01:41:44,579 --> 01:41:44,819
All right.

2395
01:41:44,819 --> 01:41:45,699
I'm just on stone, dude.

2396
01:41:46,739 --> 01:41:59,479
Like stuck over here.

2397
01:42:00,520 --> 01:42:01,800
We have a lot of plenty of track.

2398
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:02,520
Oh, monsters.

2399
01:42:03,640 --> 01:42:06,649
Are we staying straight?

2400
01:42:06,649 --> 01:42:07,689
Just straight on?

2401
01:42:07,689 --> 01:42:08,489
No reason not to.

2402
01:42:09,050 --> 01:42:09,930
Somebody can get that.

2403
01:42:09,930 --> 01:42:10,489
Are we going up?

2404
01:42:11,529 --> 01:42:12,409
We're going up.

2405
01:42:12,409 --> 01:42:12,970
Going up.

2406
01:42:13,529 --> 01:42:14,250
Okay.

2407
01:42:14,250 --> 01:42:16,329
Only one player is allowed to pick up the bucket.

2408
01:42:17,720 --> 01:42:18,680
Where's the fire?

2409
01:42:18,680 --> 01:42:19,319
Where's the bucket?

2410
01:42:19,319 --> 01:42:20,119
Water bucket.

2411
01:42:20,119 --> 01:42:20,520
You got it?

2412
01:42:21,319 --> 01:42:22,119
Dino has it.

2413
01:42:23,819 --> 01:42:24,619
There's still stone here.

2414
01:42:24,619 --> 01:42:25,260
I can't get through.

2415
01:42:25,819 --> 01:42:27,260
Auto Miner will save you eventually.

2416
01:42:28,140 --> 01:42:34,279
Oh, yeah.

2417
01:42:34,279 --> 01:42:35,079
Should we have to go up?

2418
01:42:35,640 --> 01:42:38,500
I'm just looping it so we have some time.

2419
01:42:39,220 --> 01:42:45,930
Gonna shoot through everything.

2420
01:42:47,130 --> 01:42:49,109
We need to go up.

2421
01:42:50,149 --> 01:42:50,789
Actually, we're fine.

2422
01:42:50,789 --> 01:42:51,189
What do you see?

2423
01:42:52,699 --> 01:42:53,180
We're going.

2424
01:42:54,789 --> 01:42:56,229
You have to start to go up from here.

2425
01:42:57,270 --> 01:43:00,300
And then we need to build up the bridge.

2426
01:43:04,710 --> 01:43:05,430
What are we doing?

2427
01:43:06,710 --> 01:43:07,270
What are we doing?

2428
01:43:07,270 --> 01:43:08,069
It placed weird.

2429
01:43:08,069 --> 01:43:09,189
I did not mean to do that.

2430
01:43:11,720 --> 01:43:12,840
It buys us some time.

2431
01:43:13,640 --> 01:43:14,680
Well, kill.

2432
01:43:20,439 --> 01:43:20,760
Fire?

2433
01:43:27,180 --> 01:43:29,180
There really is just too much stuff on the ground.

2434
01:43:29,739 --> 01:43:30,220
Yes.

2435
01:43:30,220 --> 01:43:31,500
There's so many resources.

2436
01:43:32,220 --> 01:43:33,500
I'm sure that would be...

2437
01:43:33,500 --> 01:43:38,619
I'm sure that would be a very much not an issue in about five minutes.

2438
01:43:42,460 --> 01:43:44,460
Too much wood stacked right there.

2439
01:43:44,460 --> 01:43:45,739
You need to pick up that stack of wood.

2440
01:43:47,340 --> 01:43:48,699
Big fat stack of wood.

2441
01:43:48,699 --> 01:43:49,020
Thank you.

2442
01:43:50,300 --> 01:43:52,470
There's so many resources.

2443
01:43:53,430 --> 01:43:59,260
We just build our bridges twice as wide just because we can.

2444
01:44:01,960 --> 01:44:03,960
This is the power of human wealth and influence.

2445
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:05,880
Yeah, this is just...

2446
01:44:06,439 --> 01:44:08,600
We've grown too fat and too greedy.

2447
01:44:14,229 --> 01:44:15,670
GG, auto, miner.

2448
01:44:15,670 --> 01:44:16,390
That's true.

2449
01:44:16,390 --> 01:44:17,270
I mean, we're pretty...

2450
01:44:18,310 --> 01:44:18,710
We still...

2451
01:44:18,710 --> 01:44:19,670
We don't even have enough...

2452
01:44:19,670 --> 01:44:20,390
We can't even do...

2453
01:44:20,949 --> 01:44:21,829
This is on fire.

2454
01:44:22,550 --> 01:44:22,949
Fuck it.

2455
01:44:23,829 --> 01:44:24,869
End it, end it, end it, end it.

2456
01:44:24,869 --> 01:44:25,350
It's on fire.

2457
01:44:25,989 --> 01:44:26,789
No, it's not.

2458
01:44:26,789 --> 01:44:27,430
It's good.

2459
01:44:27,430 --> 01:44:32,859
End it, end it, end it, end it, end it.

2460
01:44:32,859 --> 01:44:35,100
Oh, we need to get another track up there?

2461
01:44:35,100 --> 01:44:35,659
Oh, shit.

2462
01:44:36,539 --> 01:44:38,979
We don't have enough to do anything.

2463
01:44:42,340 --> 01:44:43,619
But you are doing something.

2464
01:44:44,260 --> 01:44:44,899
We have three.

2465
01:44:44,899 --> 01:44:45,539
Exactly.

2466
01:44:45,539 --> 01:44:46,500
It's fun.

2467
01:44:46,500 --> 01:44:47,380
They are, yeah.

2468
01:44:47,380 --> 01:44:49,859
You're stopping me from sleeping and eating.

2469
01:44:50,579 --> 01:44:51,380
Right now, Dino's like,

2470
01:44:51,380 --> 01:44:53,460
we could have had the engine if you wanted to save.

2471
01:44:54,020 --> 01:44:55,300
Train speed is critical.

2472
01:44:56,180 --> 01:44:57,130
What does that mean?

2473
01:44:57,850 --> 01:45:00,199
Produces dynamite.

2474
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:03,000
Yeah, just wait until next train.

2475
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:03,880
I know, I'm just reading.

2476
01:45:04,520 --> 01:45:10,630
I just wanted to see what they were.

2477
01:45:10,630 --> 01:45:10,949
Okay.

2478
01:45:11,829 --> 01:45:15,510
To try hard.

2479
01:45:16,710 --> 01:45:20,220
Get everything ready.

2480
01:45:20,220 --> 01:45:20,720
Great.

2481
01:45:21,819 --> 01:45:24,760
Our bridges have too much stone and no wood.

2482
01:45:26,199 --> 01:45:30,170
Yeah, that's actually happening right now.

2483
01:45:31,819 --> 01:45:32,939
Auto picker could use wood.

2484
01:45:35,979 --> 01:45:37,260
We could use wood.

2485
01:45:38,220 --> 01:45:40,060
Bring up.

2486
01:45:40,060 --> 01:45:41,819
We're going to get stuck.

2487
01:45:41,819 --> 01:45:42,319
We're stuck.

2488
01:45:43,020 --> 01:45:43,800
It's okay.

2489
01:45:43,800 --> 01:45:46,279
Auto miner is going to free it up.

2490
01:45:49,670 --> 01:45:51,029
We don't have any wood.

2491
01:45:51,029 --> 01:45:52,149
Who has the axe?

2492
01:45:52,149 --> 01:45:53,109
Who's got the axe?

2493
01:45:53,109 --> 01:45:55,270
I'm using the axe up here on the only trees.

2494
01:45:56,229 --> 01:46:00,430
Uh-oh.

2495
01:46:01,130 --> 01:46:03,100
This is where it gets bad.

2496
01:46:04,970 --> 01:46:06,409
Literally no trees.

2497
01:46:07,689 --> 01:46:08,569
Just bring the wood back.

2498
01:46:09,449 --> 01:46:11,609
There's so much stone all over the ground.

2499
01:46:11,609 --> 01:46:12,810
I'm like accidentally picking it up.

2500
01:46:14,010 --> 01:46:21,979
Move, move, move, move, move, move, move, move, move, move.

2501
01:46:21,979 --> 01:46:23,739
Dark, dark, dark, dark.

2502
01:46:23,739 --> 01:46:24,460
Oh my God.

2503
01:46:25,930 --> 01:46:26,649
Oh, what are you doing?

2504
01:46:26,649 --> 01:46:29,689
Dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark.

2505
01:46:29,689 --> 01:46:33,369
It's actually easier to see now than when there's fog.

2506
01:46:34,489 --> 01:46:36,630
We don't even need the axe right now.

2507
01:46:39,539 --> 01:46:40,500
Where's our bucket?

2508
01:46:41,060 --> 01:46:41,560
I got it.

2509
01:46:43,670 --> 01:46:45,430
I'm keeping one eye on that bucket.

2510
01:46:45,430 --> 01:46:46,069
Don't you worry.

2511
01:46:46,869 --> 01:46:56,039
Kill those bandits.

2512
01:46:58,409 --> 01:46:58,909
Fire.

2513
01:46:59,869 --> 01:47:05,659
All right.

2514
01:47:05,659 --> 01:47:06,680
I'm going to mine the stone over here.

2515
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:18,699
We need a bolt though.

2516
01:47:18,699 --> 01:47:22,460
We still have three bolts.

2517
01:47:22,460 --> 01:47:23,739
Do we get them quickly on the level?

2518
01:47:25,340 --> 01:47:26,619
Yeah, you get one when you win.

2519
01:47:26,619 --> 01:47:28,380
All right, well, let's just can it.

2520
01:47:28,380 --> 01:47:28,880
Let's kill it.

2521
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:34,039
Alex, grab bucket.

2522
01:47:34,039 --> 01:47:34,539
Branding two.

2523
01:47:35,399 --> 01:47:36,119
Grab what?

2524
01:47:36,119 --> 01:47:36,619
Bucket.

2525
01:47:40,359 --> 01:47:46,250
Okay, refilling it.

2526
01:47:46,810 --> 01:47:48,329
All right, let's take the opportunity to

2527
01:47:48,810 --> 01:47:50,890
stack up a bunch of shit so we don't lose it.

2528
01:47:52,090 --> 01:47:54,989
Let's have like a mile of track ready to go.

2529
01:48:02,039 --> 01:48:05,739
I want to be strong.

2530
01:48:10,829 --> 01:48:11,550
All right, right.

2531
01:48:12,510 --> 01:48:14,909
Yeah, the snow piercer video game.

2532
01:48:14,909 --> 01:48:17,229
It's time for us to get a new train engine.

2533
01:48:18,989 --> 01:48:20,270
Hi, hi, hi, dude.

2534
01:48:20,270 --> 01:48:22,350
I hope that train engine goes even slower.

2535
01:48:23,470 --> 01:48:24,909
It's probably going to be like twice as fast.

2536
01:48:24,909 --> 01:48:25,869
Train speed.

2537
01:48:25,869 --> 01:48:27,149
It resets the speed.

2538
01:48:27,949 --> 01:48:30,029
That wasn't really clear until now.

2539
01:48:30,029 --> 01:48:32,750
So the train just starts going faster until you upgrade the engine.

2540
01:48:32,750 --> 01:48:33,869
That doesn't really make sense.

2541
01:48:37,819 --> 01:48:39,739
Train speed is at 0.185.

2542
01:48:39,739 --> 01:48:40,380
New biome.

2543
01:48:42,109 --> 01:48:42,989
To Bob-omb.

2544
01:48:48,270 --> 01:48:49,789
There's two bolts above us.

2545
01:48:49,789 --> 01:48:50,829
I'm going to dig up that way.

2546
01:48:51,630 --> 01:48:57,369
We should take the train up.

2547
01:48:57,369 --> 01:48:59,689
Move those tracks so we can go up and get the bolts.

2548
01:49:00,489 --> 01:49:01,369
Uh, it's too late.

2549
01:49:02,250 --> 01:49:05,260
That's too late.

2550
01:49:05,260 --> 01:49:05,760
That's too late.

2551
01:49:12,489 --> 01:49:13,930
We need the wood tonight.

2552
01:49:14,810 --> 01:49:21,689
New biome.

2553
01:49:21,689 --> 01:49:23,130
This is tropical.

2554
01:49:25,239 --> 01:49:26,439
I think this is tundra.

2555
01:49:27,239 --> 01:49:32,039
All right, everyone grab a stack of track and we need to start moving it forward.

2556
01:49:33,079 --> 01:49:34,039
Too much track.

2557
01:49:34,840 --> 01:49:35,720
Too much track.

2558
01:49:37,079 --> 01:49:40,800
Those bolts, though.

2559
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:42,319
Those bolts look so scrumptious.

2560
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:44,479
Also, we need to mine up here.

2561
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:46,859
I got it.

2562
01:49:46,859 --> 01:49:47,359
I'll take it.

2563
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:50,600
I know it's on the bolts.

2564
01:49:50,600 --> 01:49:51,000
Don't worry.

2565
01:50:01,210 --> 01:50:05,710
We need the wood chopping up here.

2566
01:50:06,510 --> 01:50:08,250
Can I get one more right here?

2567
01:50:08,970 --> 01:50:11,680
Actually, yeah, that's fine.

2568
01:50:12,319 --> 01:50:20,939
The bolts, did he get them?

2569
01:50:22,939 --> 01:50:24,060
Hey, it's me.

2570
01:50:24,060 --> 01:50:25,260
I'm the mobile point.

2571
01:50:26,479 --> 01:50:26,979
Oh.

2572
01:50:28,829 --> 01:50:29,710
And there's the save point.

2573
01:50:29,710 --> 01:50:30,210
Look at that.

2574
01:50:31,229 --> 01:50:35,880
I have a small problem where if you do not be on the left side of the train,

2575
01:50:38,920 --> 01:50:39,960
you're going to get stuck.

2576
01:50:40,760 --> 01:50:45,479
There's so many tracks.

2577
01:50:46,359 --> 01:50:54,859
Does the auto miner have, uh,

2578
01:50:55,899 --> 01:50:59,229
We don't need any more, uh, resources.

2579
01:51:06,319 --> 01:51:06,819
Wait, wait, wait.

2580
01:51:06,819 --> 01:51:08,000
This is the cactus station?

2581
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,760
This has got to be the new biome.

2582
01:51:10,760 --> 01:51:11,260
Yeah.

2583
01:51:11,979 --> 01:51:13,500
It has a save above its head.

2584
01:51:14,939 --> 01:51:15,939
We're good.

2585
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:19,409
Take everything you can.

2586
01:51:20,449 --> 01:51:26,220
Well, locked open here, so.

2587
01:51:27,420 --> 01:51:29,180
Man, we're not even yelling at each other anymore.

2588
01:51:29,979 --> 01:51:30,699
What are you doing?

2589
01:51:30,699 --> 01:51:31,340
What are you stupid?

2590
01:51:31,340 --> 01:51:32,060
What an idiot.

2591
01:51:34,819 --> 01:51:35,859
We should probably get storage.

2592
01:51:36,819 --> 01:51:39,220
Yeah, we need one of these storage.

2593
01:51:40,720 --> 01:51:42,960
What was the comment from before?

2594
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:44,880
It's like, oh, they know what they're doing now.

2595
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:46,399
Resident sleeper.

2596
01:51:46,399 --> 01:51:48,880
What it shows you the way and why is it only one?

2597
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:57,680
Okay.

2598
01:51:57,979 --> 01:52:01,470
I didn't mean to do that.

2599
01:52:01,470 --> 01:52:01,970
Just.

2600
01:52:03,659 --> 01:52:04,699
I am the one.

2601
01:52:06,590 --> 01:52:07,390
Where are we going with this?

2602
01:52:07,390 --> 01:52:08,909
Oh, we have to go down there because of the.

2603
01:52:09,470 --> 01:52:10,350
I'm just don't.

2604
01:52:10,350 --> 01:52:11,069
This is not, don't.

2605
01:52:11,069 --> 01:52:12,430
It's not my, this is not my thing.

2606
01:52:12,989 --> 01:52:13,869
This is not my bag.

2607
01:52:13,869 --> 01:52:14,350
You know what I mean?

2608
01:52:16,500 --> 01:52:17,000
What?

2609
01:52:33,300 --> 01:52:35,300
We had a little extra track there for no reason.

2610
01:52:36,100 --> 01:52:37,220
I actually was doing it right.

2611
01:52:37,939 --> 01:52:38,899
I need to be more assertive.

2612
01:52:38,899 --> 01:52:40,979
We've got a lot of extra tracks, so.

2613
01:52:40,979 --> 01:52:41,859
Should be more assertive.

2614
01:52:43,220 --> 01:52:49,760
This is going to be a little weird over here.

2615
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:51,600
Is the auto miner really not mining this?

2616
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:54,319
Just do it faster.

2617
01:52:58,159 --> 01:52:59,680
Auto miner like kind of sucks.

2618
01:53:00,880 --> 01:53:03,710
Don't forget the water.

2619
01:53:09,699 --> 01:53:10,420
Wherever it is.

2620
01:53:11,460 --> 01:53:17,659
There is a top left.

2621
01:53:18,300 --> 01:53:21,439
Hey, I almost got the achievement engineer.

2622
01:53:22,079 --> 01:53:25,520
I've hit, I've destroyed 701 blocks out of 10,000.

2623
01:53:26,640 --> 01:53:29,359
So good at this game.

2624
01:53:30,159 --> 01:53:35,550
Don't leave that water bucket up there.

2625
01:53:36,430 --> 01:53:38,239
I was almost going to eat dinner,

2626
01:53:38,239 --> 01:53:41,199
but then it was literally the endless game mode.

2627
01:53:44,130 --> 01:53:46,289
Just one more endless mode.

2628
01:53:47,890 --> 01:53:59,010
Hey, can you come back and mine above it?

2629
01:54:00,609 --> 01:54:12,399
We're doing so good, guys.

2630
01:54:12,399 --> 01:54:13,279
We're doing so good.

2631
01:54:14,399 --> 01:54:16,720
Yeah, we're doing great in the endless mode.

2632
01:54:25,819 --> 01:54:27,180
All right, what do we need, what do you need me to do?

2633
01:54:27,180 --> 01:54:27,819
What do you need me to do?

2634
01:54:27,819 --> 01:54:28,460
Track is up.

2635
01:54:28,460 --> 01:54:29,340
Wood bridge.

2636
01:54:29,340 --> 01:54:31,979
Or we can just go around, but a wood bridge is just easier.

2637
01:54:33,260 --> 01:54:35,100
We need a wood cutter.

2638
01:54:35,899 --> 01:54:37,180
I will handle that.

2639
01:54:37,180 --> 01:54:37,979
I'll handle that.

2640
01:54:38,699 --> 01:54:48,510
Who's the founder of my bucket?

2641
01:54:48,510 --> 01:54:49,789
Is it just me or is this endless?

2642
01:54:51,149 --> 01:54:53,550
Yes, that is what you signed up for.

2643
01:54:54,189 --> 01:54:55,229
Can you stop bumping?

2644
01:54:56,510 --> 01:54:58,430
It totally knocks my stuff off.

2645
01:54:58,430 --> 01:55:02,109
I did offer you to order you and all your friends a pizza.

2646
01:55:02,750 --> 01:55:03,710
Order me a pizza.

2647
01:55:04,670 --> 01:55:07,260
What kind of pizza do you want?

2648
01:55:07,260 --> 01:55:09,840
Uh, me a pizza?

2649
01:55:10,560 --> 01:55:13,680
I have a pizza.

2650
01:55:17,779 --> 01:55:19,619
We have one tree up here that needs to be chopped.

2651
01:55:20,579 --> 01:55:24,479
And he's very close to getting the golden ticket.

2652
01:55:25,119 --> 01:55:26,319
We've got plenty of time.

2653
01:55:26,319 --> 01:55:28,159
We need to chop these cacodice.

2654
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:29,520
We've got time.

2655
01:55:30,479 --> 01:55:36,029
All right, I will get it.

2656
01:55:36,029 --> 01:55:36,989
Who's got the axe?

2657
01:55:38,210 --> 01:55:39,890
Uh, Dino has axe?

2658
01:55:39,890 --> 01:55:41,010
No, Penguin has axe.

2659
01:55:41,890 --> 01:55:42,689
He did.

2660
01:55:42,689 --> 01:55:44,050
He just dropped it.

2661
01:55:44,689 --> 01:55:52,109
Bring it on.

2662
01:55:52,109 --> 01:55:56,130
All right, stack all the track and put out the fire.

2663
01:55:58,979 --> 01:56:00,369
Where's the bucket?

2664
01:56:01,649 --> 01:56:02,850
Who has the bucket?

2665
01:56:02,850 --> 01:56:03,329
You do.

2666
01:56:03,970 --> 01:56:04,449
Just end it.

2667
01:56:06,689 --> 01:56:07,090
Damn it.

2668
01:56:07,979 --> 01:56:10,300
Oh, it's not going to explode.

2669
01:56:10,300 --> 01:56:11,340
He has to stay.

2670
01:56:13,340 --> 01:56:14,939
All right, get a pizza.

2671
01:56:15,659 --> 01:56:19,890
Put it on the German 985 tab.

2672
01:56:19,890 --> 01:56:21,649
I don't want a pizza, Germa.

2673
01:56:21,649 --> 01:56:25,010
Order a sandwich from SubSandwich.

2674
01:56:25,729 --> 01:56:28,850
Germa, I'm on the road to commander.

2675
01:56:29,729 --> 01:56:30,539
What does that mean?

2676
01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:34,399
You know, you don't know what the road to commander is.

2677
01:56:35,359 --> 01:56:37,760
Wait, what about the ghost?

2678
01:56:38,720 --> 01:56:41,039
We're getting stack grabber level three.

2679
01:56:42,239 --> 01:56:45,380
It has extra range and plus one stack size.

2680
01:56:46,420 --> 01:56:52,829
SubSandwich TM.

2681
01:56:55,119 --> 01:56:55,920
Don't worry, Star.

2682
01:56:55,920 --> 01:56:57,520
It looks like it's getting hard for us.

2683
01:56:57,520 --> 01:57:00,000
And as you know, we're not very good.

2684
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,319
It's really not hard at all anymore.

2685
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:13,340
It's not hard at all.

2686
01:57:14,300 --> 01:57:15,569
Stop.

2687
01:57:15,569 --> 01:57:16,050
EG.

2688
01:57:19,630 --> 01:57:20,670
I like this music.

2689
01:57:20,750 --> 01:57:25,180
Sounds like a grandfather clock.

2690
01:57:25,180 --> 01:57:26,300
Oh, never mind.

2691
01:57:26,300 --> 01:57:27,180
We need a woodcutter.

2692
01:57:28,140 --> 01:57:28,699
That's me.

2693
01:57:28,699 --> 01:57:29,100
I got it.

2694
01:57:29,739 --> 01:57:44,979
I'm getting a sandwich from Subway.

2695
01:57:46,340 --> 01:57:47,409
I know.

2696
01:57:47,970 --> 01:57:48,850
I try not to.

2697
01:57:49,890 --> 01:57:53,659
Who would do that?

2698
01:57:58,060 --> 01:57:59,020
Can we just chop these?

2699
01:58:01,300 --> 01:58:04,100
All three of us are like standing here.

2700
01:58:05,680 --> 01:58:07,520
Well, if you don't chop it, you can't go around.

2701
01:58:12,239 --> 01:58:13,840
Dude, somebody has to deal with those.

2702
01:58:13,840 --> 01:58:15,119
Somebody has to deal with those peanuts.

2703
01:58:15,760 --> 01:58:19,039
We're walking around each person just standing,

2704
01:58:19,039 --> 01:58:21,680
holding track, waiting to place them.

2705
01:58:21,680 --> 01:58:24,079
There's an infinite amount of track being created.

2706
01:58:24,079 --> 01:58:25,359
When do I get upgrades to my teams?

2707
01:58:25,359 --> 01:58:26,319
Don't forget those.

2708
01:58:26,319 --> 01:58:27,279
Don't forget that bucket.

2709
01:58:27,279 --> 01:58:29,199
And don't forget helping me with these beandits.

2710
01:58:30,560 --> 01:58:31,920
And fuck your beandits.

2711
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:35,119
Uh, we need to go north, I think.

2712
01:58:36,579 --> 01:58:36,899
East.

2713
01:58:38,340 --> 01:58:43,229
And take the bridge.

2714
01:58:45,329 --> 01:58:46,770
I told you not to leave.

2715
01:58:46,770 --> 01:58:48,930
I told you not to leave the bucket.

2716
01:58:49,010 --> 01:58:51,729
And you didn't listen to me.

2717
01:58:53,300 --> 01:58:54,659
I mean, where's the bucket?

2718
01:58:55,380 --> 01:58:55,859
I haven't.

2719
01:58:56,739 --> 01:58:58,739
I don't care where the bucket is.

2720
01:59:01,680 --> 01:59:03,279
I don't care.

2721
01:59:06,029 --> 01:59:07,149
Okay, I give up.

2722
01:59:07,149 --> 01:59:07,550
You win.

2723
01:59:08,430 --> 01:59:14,579
Can we get more bridges?

2724
01:59:16,180 --> 01:59:17,300
I'm just on wood duty.

2725
01:59:27,699 --> 01:59:28,340
This is wrong.

2726
01:59:29,060 --> 01:59:31,500
We can dig down.

2727
01:59:32,539 --> 01:59:34,739
Go down.

2728
01:59:35,300 --> 01:59:37,460
No, not okay.

2729
01:59:37,460 --> 01:59:38,659
Well, you just made that harder.

2730
01:59:38,979 --> 01:59:39,859
You know, we're good.

2731
01:59:39,859 --> 01:59:41,699
You guys gotta leave space on either side.

2732
01:59:42,899 --> 01:59:43,699
Did you get that achievement?

2733
01:59:43,699 --> 01:59:44,100
We're gonna get stuck.

2734
01:59:45,060 --> 01:59:46,500
Done.

2735
01:59:47,060 --> 01:59:51,409
What, you want a pizza, too?

2736
01:59:51,970 --> 01:59:52,529
We're done.

2737
01:59:52,529 --> 01:59:52,930
Just a second.

2738
01:59:52,930 --> 01:59:53,489
It's gonna explode.

2739
01:59:54,930 --> 01:59:55,409
This bucket.

2740
01:59:55,409 --> 01:59:57,409
You guys gotta have some foresight.

2741
02:00:00,539 --> 02:00:01,739
Have some foresight.

2742
02:00:01,739 --> 02:00:02,380
It's Alex.

2743
02:00:02,380 --> 02:00:03,579
This is really easy.

2744
02:00:03,579 --> 02:00:05,180
We have 40 tracks.

2745
02:00:06,539 --> 02:00:09,180
Our train is auto-destroying everything.

2746
02:00:10,220 --> 02:00:12,380
It's auto-collecting everything it destroys.

2747
02:00:12,380 --> 02:00:14,300
Guys, so easy.

2748
02:00:14,300 --> 02:00:15,899
You won't mind if I go ahead and complete this.

2749
02:00:16,939 --> 02:00:17,659
Please explode.

2750
02:00:22,979 --> 02:00:24,340
All right, let's upgrade.

2751
02:00:26,829 --> 02:00:27,630
No, wait, number four.

2752
02:00:30,779 --> 02:00:33,420
Increases the efficiency of neighboring wagons.

2753
02:00:33,420 --> 02:00:35,260
I don't think we need any more efficiency.

2754
02:00:35,260 --> 02:00:36,619
We are as efficient as we can get.

2755
02:00:37,260 --> 02:00:38,460
I think we could be more efficient.

2756
02:00:38,460 --> 02:00:40,460
Why not get another storage cart?

2757
02:00:41,579 --> 02:00:48,220
Please put it in the correct space in your rush.

2758
02:00:48,220 --> 02:00:49,979
Dinosaur's having a fit.

2759
02:00:49,979 --> 02:00:51,819
Oh, it really is the second storage cart.

2760
02:00:52,060 --> 02:00:53,260
Oh, two storage carts.

2761
02:00:53,260 --> 02:01:00,109
I thought it was an upgrade, but it does say new wagon.

2762
02:01:02,239 --> 02:01:03,840
Do you want to live so much, baby?

2763
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:07,600
Baby, you should just do it on your own because I'm fucking...

2764
02:01:10,720 --> 02:01:12,239
Okay, what is going on with these?

2765
02:01:13,920 --> 02:01:15,760
I'm gonna address my stream at the moment.

2766
02:01:17,760 --> 02:01:19,100
Co-op game.

2767
02:01:20,300 --> 02:01:23,680
Person you're playing with hates the thing you're doing.

2768
02:01:25,979 --> 02:01:27,420
This is happening again.

2769
02:01:28,140 --> 02:01:34,060
I got guilted by my mom to keep playing the train game twice.

2770
02:01:34,060 --> 02:01:35,420
I think I got guilted twice.

2771
02:01:35,420 --> 02:01:37,420
I just keep letting, I'm a pushover.

2772
02:01:37,420 --> 02:01:39,739
Mom probably thinks this is really cute and fun.

2773
02:01:39,739 --> 02:01:43,899
How many comments about the dinosaur have been made, do you think?

2774
02:01:50,029 --> 02:01:50,270
What?

2775
02:01:51,149 --> 02:01:52,189
How many comments about like,

2776
02:01:52,189 --> 02:01:53,949
oh, this is so cute for the dinosaur.

2777
02:01:53,949 --> 02:01:54,909
Do you think it's gonna happen?

2778
02:01:55,949 --> 02:01:58,220
What are you talking about?

2779
02:01:59,579 --> 02:02:02,380
I'm talking about once since you've kept playing,

2780
02:02:02,380 --> 02:02:05,579
we've gotten a new party member who's this awesome,

2781
02:02:05,579 --> 02:02:08,060
cute dinosaur that is really effective.

2782
02:02:08,060 --> 02:02:10,220
By the way, the reason why this is probably so easy

2783
02:02:10,220 --> 02:02:12,699
is because we have the dinosaur buddy.

2784
02:02:13,659 --> 02:02:18,689
I mean, yeah, even if he sucked, it would be 33%.

2785
02:02:19,329 --> 02:02:21,489
Well, if he sucked, really bad.

2786
02:02:21,489 --> 02:02:22,930
Please explode, please explode.

2787
02:02:25,859 --> 02:02:27,619
No one is even using tools.

2788
02:02:29,699 --> 02:02:30,500
And you're gonna tell me,

2789
02:02:31,060 --> 02:02:32,739
do you think endless mode is gonna end soon?

2790
02:02:32,739 --> 02:02:34,420
Do you think it's gonna change dramatically

2791
02:02:34,420 --> 02:02:36,020
if we went to an entirely different biome?

2792
02:02:36,020 --> 02:02:36,659
Guess what changed?

2793
02:02:37,619 --> 02:02:38,979
Well, we're about to do it again.

2794
02:02:38,979 --> 02:02:41,060
And this has gotten a little more difficult.

2795
02:02:42,829 --> 02:02:44,510
This is the easiest one yet.

2796
02:02:44,510 --> 02:02:45,710
Well, there's no trees.

2797
02:02:45,710 --> 02:02:50,020
So we need a lot of chops, fast.

2798
02:02:50,659 --> 02:02:51,220
I got it.

2799
02:02:52,100 --> 02:02:53,300
Because we need to build bridges.

2800
02:02:53,939 --> 02:02:54,579
But you don't.

2801
02:02:56,770 --> 02:02:58,689
Now the station looks like a cactus.

2802
02:03:00,819 --> 02:03:01,460
That's pretty cool.

2803
02:03:01,460 --> 02:03:02,260
You don't think that's cool?

2804
02:03:03,140 --> 02:03:14,060
All right.

2805
02:03:14,060 --> 02:03:17,420
Listen, I'm just very hungry, very tired.

2806
02:03:19,359 --> 02:03:21,199
Oh, why don't you just call in?

2807
02:03:21,199 --> 02:03:22,880
And I want to be able to drown.

2808
02:03:24,399 --> 02:03:26,960
No, I'm on the road to commander.

2809
02:03:28,319 --> 02:03:29,520
What are you talking about?

2810
02:03:29,520 --> 02:03:30,720
What do you mean the road to commander?

2811
02:03:31,439 --> 02:03:32,449
What does that mean?

2812
02:03:33,170 --> 02:03:34,689
What game is commander?

2813
02:03:35,729 --> 02:03:36,770
You're playing League?

2814
02:03:36,770 --> 02:03:38,529
Do you really not remember that?

2815
02:03:38,529 --> 02:03:39,329
League of Legends?

2816
02:03:40,130 --> 02:03:40,850
Oh my God.

2817
02:03:40,850 --> 02:03:41,409
Are you playing?

2818
02:03:43,090 --> 02:03:49,279
That was the original YouTube

2819
02:03:49,279 --> 02:03:52,079
on the actual machinima channel thing to do.

2820
02:03:54,619 --> 02:03:56,380
To record your road to commander

2821
02:03:56,380 --> 02:03:58,220
and call of duty, which was like max level.

2822
02:04:00,720 --> 02:04:01,359
Oh, okay.

2823
02:04:02,319 --> 02:04:03,920
Oh, now it sounds.

2824
02:04:03,920 --> 02:04:04,479
Now I get it.

2825
02:04:04,479 --> 02:04:05,920
Okay, now I get why he spent

2826
02:04:05,920 --> 02:04:07,520
this much time saying road to commander.

2827
02:04:07,520 --> 02:04:08,640
Now it makes sense.

2828
02:04:08,640 --> 02:04:10,000
Can you get inside the lines?

2829
02:04:10,640 --> 02:04:11,760
No, I'm going to bed.

2830
02:04:13,359 --> 02:04:14,880
Well, this is tier three.

2831
02:04:14,880 --> 02:04:15,840
New biome incoming.

2832
02:04:15,840 --> 02:04:17,119
It's a snow biome.

2833
02:04:17,119 --> 02:04:19,520
And I know you love these snow levels.

2834
02:04:19,520 --> 02:04:21,279
It's just trees.

2835
02:04:21,279 --> 02:04:23,199
He did love the ice in the last game.

2836
02:04:23,199 --> 02:04:23,920
Yeah, I remember that.

2837
02:04:23,920 --> 02:04:24,420
He did.

2838
02:04:24,420 --> 02:04:28,079
It's the same thing, Ed.

2839
02:04:29,720 --> 02:04:32,840
Okay, I'm desperately trying to fix this.

2840
02:04:32,840 --> 02:04:37,750
Does it go faster over ice?

2841
02:04:39,029 --> 02:04:39,989
I don't know.

2842
02:04:39,989 --> 02:04:41,029
It's the same thing.

2843
02:04:41,029 --> 02:04:42,390
What does that ever stop you from playing?

2844
02:04:42,390 --> 02:04:43,350
I don't know.

2845
02:04:44,390 --> 02:04:45,510
That was so sad.

2846
02:04:51,600 --> 02:04:52,720
Yeah, the slippery ice.

2847
02:04:53,859 --> 02:04:55,300
Dino's clearing ice though.

2848
02:04:56,960 --> 02:04:59,279
You walk slower on it.

2849
02:04:59,279 --> 02:05:03,640
Oh, don't get stuck back here.

2850
02:05:03,640 --> 02:05:04,439
We need that pickaxe.

2851
02:05:05,079 --> 02:05:19,109
Are we going up and right?

2852
02:05:20,069 --> 02:05:21,270
Or which way are we going?

2853
02:05:21,270 --> 02:05:21,750
I think...

2854
02:05:22,789 --> 02:05:25,029
Just go that way, go that way, go that way.

2855
02:05:25,029 --> 02:05:25,989
Just go the way you're going.

2856
02:05:25,989 --> 02:05:27,350
Oh, why is it respawning?

2857
02:05:28,390 --> 02:05:31,430
There's snow coming back.

2858
02:05:33,750 --> 02:05:34,789
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2859
02:05:34,789 --> 02:05:35,189
Where's the...

2860
02:05:36,550 --> 02:05:38,310
Where's my tool?

2861
02:05:38,310 --> 02:05:39,670
What is going on?

2862
02:05:39,670 --> 02:05:40,710
Who sprinted?

2863
02:05:40,710 --> 02:05:41,210
My tools.

2864
02:05:42,310 --> 02:05:44,390
The ash really doesn't even make you go faster.

2865
02:05:45,029 --> 02:05:45,750
It does though.

2866
02:05:47,270 --> 02:05:48,630
All right, turn it out.

2867
02:05:48,630 --> 02:05:49,270
Turn it down here.

2868
02:05:50,229 --> 02:05:56,199
The snow is fucking me up.

2869
02:05:56,920 --> 02:05:58,710
I can't even get rid of the snow.

2870
02:05:59,510 --> 02:06:01,350
I believe that is its intended purpose.

2871
02:06:03,279 --> 02:06:04,079
Oh, I...

2872
02:06:05,359 --> 02:06:09,779
There's the bucket, bucket, water bucket.

2873
02:06:13,960 --> 02:06:18,439
What stir won't talk to me for a month, says my mom.

2874
02:06:18,439 --> 02:06:18,760
Lol.

2875
02:06:19,640 --> 02:06:20,760
And she says lol.

2876
02:06:20,760 --> 02:06:21,720
I don't know what this means.

2877
02:06:21,720 --> 02:06:22,220
Lol.

2878
02:06:23,239 --> 02:06:26,239
Call your mother.

2879
02:06:31,109 --> 02:06:32,310
Call your mother.

2880
02:06:32,310 --> 02:06:34,310
Don't craft any tracks for 40 seconds.

2881
02:06:34,310 --> 02:06:36,229
Apparently, we did an achievement.

2882
02:06:37,109 --> 02:06:41,720
All right, but we do need stone in here like pretty soon.

2883
02:06:41,720 --> 02:06:42,600
I'm just mining it.

2884
02:06:43,960 --> 02:06:46,159
There's not much else.

2885
02:06:46,960 --> 02:06:48,239
The stone is not really that...

2886
02:06:49,920 --> 02:06:50,720
What do you mean we're stuck?

2887
02:06:54,449 --> 02:06:55,170
What do you mean?

2888
02:06:55,970 --> 02:06:56,689
We're dead.

2889
02:06:56,689 --> 02:06:57,010
We lose.

2890
02:06:57,010 --> 02:06:57,409
No, we're not.

2891
02:06:57,409 --> 02:06:57,649
What?

2892
02:06:57,649 --> 02:06:57,970
How?

2893
02:06:58,850 --> 02:06:59,569
We can't get through.

2894
02:07:00,369 --> 02:07:01,329
I can't break that.

2895
02:07:01,329 --> 02:07:01,810
I can't break it.

2896
02:07:03,090 --> 02:07:04,289
Oh, I can, I can, I can, I can.

2897
02:07:05,970 --> 02:07:07,569
Dino, dino, dino, dino, dino.

2898
02:07:07,569 --> 02:07:08,289
Down to me.

2899
02:07:08,289 --> 02:07:09,010
Track, dino.

2900
02:07:09,810 --> 02:07:10,609
Oh no, I'm stuck.

2901
02:07:11,250 --> 02:07:13,649
And then I was the one who saved it of all people.

2902
02:07:16,920 --> 02:07:19,800
And built the back way bridge.

2903
02:07:22,319 --> 02:07:25,199
You had the opportunity to like get out of here.

2904
02:07:25,199 --> 02:07:26,159
But you chose.

2905
02:07:27,119 --> 02:07:30,479
You chose to put that track down.

2906
02:07:30,479 --> 02:07:32,640
You could have been like, oh no, no, no, no.

2907
02:07:32,640 --> 02:07:34,560
Oh, I didn't get there.

2908
02:07:34,560 --> 02:07:35,359
Oh, wow.

2909
02:07:35,359 --> 02:07:37,119
There was nothing that could be done.

2910
02:07:37,119 --> 02:07:38,239
You could have done that.

2911
02:07:38,239 --> 02:07:39,119
That could have been you.

2912
02:07:39,119 --> 02:07:39,840
All right, which ways?

2913
02:07:40,640 --> 02:07:41,760
I don't even know what's mine.

2914
02:07:41,760 --> 02:07:42,239
Right ahead.

2915
02:07:42,640 --> 02:07:43,920
How do we even get over here?

2916
02:07:43,920 --> 02:07:45,439
This is, we need to, we need path.

2917
02:07:45,439 --> 02:07:46,239
We need wood.

2918
02:07:47,680 --> 02:07:49,319
How do we, we can't get up there.

2919
02:07:50,199 --> 02:07:51,239
Oh, right in the down.

2920
02:07:51,239 --> 02:07:51,880
Get the bridge.

2921
02:07:51,880 --> 02:07:52,840
Yeah, we get a bridge.

2922
02:07:53,720 --> 02:07:58,310
The fuck out of my way.

2923
02:07:59,350 --> 02:08:03,279
I don't think we can do this, guys.

2924
02:08:04,319 --> 02:08:06,439
I mean, it's pretty buried in there.

2925
02:08:07,239 --> 02:08:08,869
Is that, we need the axe.

2926
02:08:08,869 --> 02:08:11,680
Pickaxe, I don't even know who has it.

2927
02:08:11,680 --> 02:08:12,720
I'm dashing.

2928
02:08:12,720 --> 02:08:13,439
Out of my way.

2929
02:08:14,800 --> 02:08:16,159
I don't think we can do this.

2930
02:08:17,199 --> 02:08:20,100
The music stopped and it stopped.

2931
02:08:20,340 --> 02:08:22,180
And it stopped for anyone else ominous much.

2932
02:08:23,060 --> 02:08:27,300
That's just where the.

2933
02:08:27,300 --> 02:08:28,020
All right, I got it.

2934
02:08:28,020 --> 02:08:28,420
It's clear.

2935
02:08:31,560 --> 02:08:35,189
It's a save point.

2936
02:08:35,829 --> 02:08:38,819
Look, dude, fuck it.

2937
02:08:38,819 --> 02:08:40,180
Let's just go to the next biome.

2938
02:08:40,180 --> 02:08:40,899
Let's just see it all.

2939
02:08:41,699 --> 02:08:41,939
Cool.

2940
02:08:41,939 --> 02:08:43,460
Let's save and come back tomorrow.

2941
02:08:44,260 --> 02:08:48,560
We're not going to do that.

2942
02:08:48,560 --> 02:08:50,159
We're not going to do that.

2943
02:08:56,050 --> 02:08:56,529
All right.

2944
02:08:56,529 --> 02:08:59,090
Doesn't the steam from the engine melt the snow or something?

2945
02:09:03,970 --> 02:09:05,250
No, don't, don't, don't.

2946
02:09:05,250 --> 02:09:06,130
Why would you do that?

2947
02:09:06,130 --> 02:09:08,050
Why would you just do that blindly?

2948
02:09:08,930 --> 02:09:09,430
What?

2949
02:09:10,529 --> 02:09:14,260
You don't want dynamite.

2950
02:09:15,220 --> 02:09:17,329
We got an extra.

2951
02:09:17,329 --> 02:09:19,250
We got three wagons we could add.

2952
02:09:19,250 --> 02:09:19,649
Nope.

2953
02:09:19,649 --> 02:09:21,649
Let's add like a new engine.

2954
02:09:21,649 --> 02:09:22,930
No, no, no, no.

2955
02:09:22,930 --> 02:09:23,430
No.

2956
02:09:24,850 --> 02:09:26,619
Hello.

2957
02:09:29,220 --> 02:09:30,020
I want to see the.

2958
02:09:30,020 --> 02:09:31,060
I want to see the new biome.

2959
02:09:33,079 --> 02:09:33,960
It's lava.

2960
02:09:33,960 --> 02:09:34,600
He called it.

2961
02:09:35,079 --> 02:09:36,119
Pumpkin scary.

2962
02:09:39,189 --> 02:09:39,829
Wow.

2963
02:09:39,829 --> 02:09:40,390
I bet.

2964
02:09:40,390 --> 02:09:40,630
All right.

2965
02:09:40,630 --> 02:09:43,590
If I get bumped into by Jerma one more time,

2966
02:09:43,590 --> 02:09:45,189
I'm going to quit before Stardust.

2967
02:09:45,989 --> 02:09:46,710
Isn't that the gold?

2968
02:09:52,630 --> 02:09:53,430
Okay.

2969
02:09:53,750 --> 02:09:54,390
This is different.

2970
02:09:57,270 --> 02:10:02,439
This is slightly different.

2971
02:10:02,439 --> 02:10:03,479
This just turns your head.

2972
02:10:04,600 --> 02:10:08,319
It's a good thing that I, I don't know,

2973
02:10:09,750 --> 02:10:18,199
have an IQ greater than one and thus I can compensate.

2974
02:10:21,909 --> 02:10:26,149
I'm pretty sure some root vegetables have IQs of one.

2975
02:10:27,270 --> 02:10:29,350
So, I mean, that's not even accurate.

2976
02:10:30,239 --> 02:10:32,640
But I just mean I have at least one.

2977
02:10:32,640 --> 02:10:33,680
That's what you need.

2978
02:10:33,680 --> 02:10:37,119
And vegetables could definitely succeed at the.

2979
02:10:38,399 --> 02:10:39,199
That's all I'm saying.

2980
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:40,239
Yeah.

2981
02:10:40,239 --> 02:10:42,479
When they got three other dinosaurs carrying,

2982
02:10:44,180 --> 02:10:46,579
they don't have to show up for work because they ate too much glue.

2983
02:10:54,390 --> 02:10:55,430
How could there be water here?

2984
02:10:56,310 --> 02:10:59,680
And like, it's cool.

2985
02:10:59,680 --> 02:11:00,399
It's lava.

2986
02:11:01,279 --> 02:11:02,720
It's orange water.

2987
02:11:05,329 --> 02:11:06,050
Uh oh.

2988
02:11:06,050 --> 02:11:07,170
I can't fit.

2989
02:11:07,170 --> 02:11:09,970
Oh, I wonder if we got dynamite if we could blow up that rock.

2990
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:13,319
Maybe.

2991
02:11:15,640 --> 02:11:18,739
Where's the bucket?

2992
02:11:18,739 --> 02:11:19,699
What's wrong?

2993
02:11:19,699 --> 02:11:20,180
Where's the bucket?

2994
02:11:20,180 --> 02:11:20,659
Where's the bucket?

2995
02:11:21,859 --> 02:11:22,819
That's in the front.

2996
02:11:22,819 --> 02:11:23,140
We got it.

2997
02:11:23,140 --> 02:11:23,380
Okay.

2998
02:11:26,420 --> 02:11:27,619
I mean, that's all.

2999
02:11:27,619 --> 02:11:29,300
Oh, you can't build bridges.

3000
02:11:30,340 --> 02:11:32,420
Um, why is it going?

3001
02:11:33,619 --> 02:11:33,939
What?

3002
02:11:35,640 --> 02:11:36,359
I'm dead.

3003
02:11:36,359 --> 02:11:37,079
Why are we dead?

3004
02:11:38,119 --> 02:11:39,520
Is that the dream?

3005
02:11:39,520 --> 02:11:42,479
Why are we, why are we parachute?

3006
02:11:42,479 --> 02:11:42,979
What?

3007
02:11:45,489 --> 02:11:46,529
Oh, you're on it.

3008
02:11:46,529 --> 02:11:47,649
Oh, I don't.

3009
02:11:47,649 --> 02:11:49,489
Yeah, we got exploded.

3010
02:11:49,489 --> 02:11:51,890
Is that the grim reaper?

3011
02:11:52,930 --> 02:11:54,289
It was weird looking.

3012
02:11:54,930 --> 02:11:56,770
I couldn't tell what it was.

3013
02:11:59,970 --> 02:12:01,090
Well, I was confused though,

3014
02:12:01,090 --> 02:12:03,409
because I couldn't build a bridge, but we would need to there.

3015
02:12:04,449 --> 02:12:06,760
Ah, that's so funny.

3016
02:12:09,159 --> 02:12:10,439
Lava biome too hard.

3017
02:12:10,439 --> 02:12:11,720
I got temporarily cocks.

3018
02:12:12,739 --> 02:12:15,220
All right, guys, you know, that was a great fun night.

3019
02:12:15,220 --> 02:12:18,899
I had a lot of fun, but I can't wait to just stuff my face.

3020
02:12:19,140 --> 02:12:20,739
My road to commander continues.

3021
02:12:21,380 --> 02:12:22,710
That was fun.

3022
02:12:23,859 --> 02:12:24,100
Yeah.

3023
02:12:24,100 --> 02:12:25,300
I like the train game.

3024
02:12:25,300 --> 02:12:26,100
The train game is fun.

3025
02:12:26,100 --> 02:12:29,939
Train game is fun, but train game may be too easy with four people.

3026
02:12:30,500 --> 02:12:31,619
I like the other game too,

3027
02:12:31,619 --> 02:12:33,939
but I also would kind of just rather play overcooked too.

3028
02:12:35,460 --> 02:12:36,819
They're almost the same.

3029
02:12:36,819 --> 02:12:38,340
And one has cheeseburgers, right?

3030
02:12:39,300 --> 02:12:41,909
You could, you could set it to heart.

3031
02:12:41,909 --> 02:12:43,270
Yeah, we could have set it to hard.

3032
02:12:43,270 --> 02:12:44,789
Have you played it overcooked?

3033
02:12:46,130 --> 02:12:46,529
Yes.

3034
02:12:47,569 --> 02:12:49,970
Oh, I haven't played it.

3035
02:12:51,060 --> 02:12:53,619
It's basically the moving game, but with food.

3036
02:12:54,720 --> 02:12:55,520
I like food.

3037
02:12:56,399 --> 02:12:57,760
You would probably really like that game.

3038
02:12:57,760 --> 02:13:01,760
I feel like you'd be that the remember House of Dead Ninjas.

3039
02:13:02,479 --> 02:13:04,710
Remember how you like got obsessed with that

3040
02:13:04,710 --> 02:13:06,550
and you got the world record for one at one point.

3041
02:13:07,189 --> 02:13:08,149
I still have it.

3042
02:13:08,149 --> 02:13:10,789
You still have the world record for a Super House of Dead Ninjas.

3043
02:13:10,789 --> 02:13:13,430
I had to get it back at one point, but I have it again now.

3044
02:13:13,430 --> 02:13:13,750
Okay.

3045
02:13:13,750 --> 02:13:16,069
Because I feel like that's one of those games that you would just,

3046
02:13:16,069 --> 02:13:18,789
okay, I'm just going to beat every game at every level as fast as I can.

3047
02:13:19,510 --> 02:13:20,710
I don't know.

3048
02:13:21,670 --> 02:13:23,109
And I would have to play the game.

3049
02:13:23,909 --> 02:13:28,130
Well, look at how far we got.

3050
02:13:28,130 --> 02:13:29,090
We did get very far.

3051
02:13:29,649 --> 02:13:33,300
That was just a nice nostalgia watching that.

3052
02:13:33,300 --> 02:13:33,859
That was fun.

3053
02:13:34,659 --> 02:13:36,819
Okay.

3054
02:13:36,819 --> 02:13:37,699
All right.

3055
02:13:37,699 --> 02:13:38,020
Okay.

3056
02:13:39,060 --> 02:13:40,020
Okay.

3057
02:13:40,020 --> 02:13:40,659
Name reveal.

3058
02:13:40,659 --> 02:13:41,619
We got the name reveal.

3059
02:13:43,859 --> 02:13:44,739
They got out quick.

3060
02:13:45,859 --> 02:13:47,380
Got out real fast.

3061
02:13:47,380 --> 02:13:48,340
Name reveal.

3062
02:13:49,300 --> 02:13:49,859
I'm out.

3063
02:13:49,859 --> 02:13:50,180
I'm out.

3064
02:13:52,529 --> 02:13:53,090
I'm out.

3065
02:13:53,729 --> 02:13:55,430
All right.

3066
02:13:55,430 --> 02:13:56,470
Goodbye, Star.

3067
02:13:56,470 --> 02:13:57,430
Thanks for playing.

3068
02:13:57,430 --> 02:13:58,229
Thanks for streaming.

3069
02:13:59,270 --> 02:14:01,189
Thanks for watching Star's chat.

3070
02:14:01,189 --> 02:14:01,829
Oh, he's already gone.

3071
02:14:04,289 --> 02:14:05,329
He's already dead.

3072
02:14:08,520 --> 02:14:09,670
Well, that was fun.

3073
02:14:10,310 --> 02:14:11,029
Yep.

3074
02:14:11,029 --> 02:14:12,680
That was good.

3075
02:14:12,680 --> 02:14:15,640
I'll let you get to your...

3076
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,720
I'll let you say bye to your stream, but say bye to mine.

3077
02:14:19,720 --> 02:14:20,520
I'll say bye to yours.

3078
02:14:21,960 --> 02:14:24,279
So just before we go.

3079
02:14:24,279 --> 02:14:24,520
Sure.

3080
02:14:25,159 --> 02:14:32,079
I just wanted everybody to know how often and frequently

3081
02:14:32,079 --> 02:14:34,640
Jerma has been asking me to play Halo recently.

3082
02:14:34,640 --> 02:14:36,319
I was just trying to figure out if...

3083
02:14:38,399 --> 02:14:38,960
Yeah, I just haven't.

3084
02:14:38,960 --> 02:14:39,680
I haven't played it.

3085
02:14:39,680 --> 02:14:42,319
So I was looking for like someone to play it with.

3086
02:14:42,319 --> 02:14:45,779
And I was just like kind of throwing some lines up

3087
02:14:45,779 --> 02:14:46,899
to see if anybody had played it yet.

3088
02:14:47,539 --> 02:14:48,739
It's been like every day though.

3089
02:14:49,699 --> 02:14:51,920
Well, since about two days ago.

3090
02:14:53,039 --> 02:14:55,439
I wanted to wait a few days after it came out just to check it out.

3091
02:15:00,640 --> 02:15:02,159
Halo with the Dino.

3092
02:15:04,289 --> 02:15:05,090
Yeah.

3093
02:15:05,090 --> 02:15:06,289
Come on in Dino.

3094
02:15:06,289 --> 02:15:07,329
Three person Halo.

3095
02:15:11,319 --> 02:15:13,399
Dude, I don't even know who that person is.

3096
02:15:14,359 --> 02:15:20,239
He left before I could even see his name.

3097
02:15:25,479 --> 02:15:26,760
It's Styrr's mom.

3098
02:15:29,619 --> 02:15:32,100
Now that would be very, very interesting.

3099
02:15:33,729 --> 02:15:34,130
All right.

3100
02:15:34,130 --> 02:15:34,689
Bye everyone.

3101
02:15:35,329 --> 02:15:35,569
Yeah.

3102
02:15:35,569 --> 02:15:36,770
Thanks a lot for playing, Talix.

3103
02:15:37,989 --> 02:15:40,789
If you don't follow Talix or Styrr, they both stream.

3104
02:15:40,789 --> 02:15:41,989
They both were streaming.

3105
02:15:45,750 --> 02:15:46,550
Take care, Talix.

3106
02:15:47,409 --> 02:15:47,890
See you soon.

3107
02:15:48,529 --> 02:15:53,350
I'll play Reach with you, Jerma.

3108
02:15:53,350 --> 02:15:54,310
I'm playing it right now.

3109
02:15:56,880 --> 02:15:57,119
Yeah.

3110
02:15:57,119 --> 02:15:58,640
That's probably what we'll call it there tonight.

3111
02:15:59,279 --> 02:16:02,880
And that will conclude the non-canon co-op week.

3112
02:16:03,600 --> 02:16:07,560
You know something I did not think I was ever going to see

3113
02:16:12,130 --> 02:16:13,810
is I looked over here quite a few times

3114
02:16:14,449 --> 02:16:19,319
and I saw a lot of Nancy Drew demands.

3115
02:16:23,810 --> 02:16:25,569
I'm actually, I'm surprised.

3116
02:16:26,289 --> 02:16:28,050
I am very surprised by this.

3117
02:16:28,850 --> 02:16:33,090
But just know that I do have a ton of them.

3118
02:16:33,649 --> 02:16:39,750
So hey, anytime that there's something, nothing to do

3119
02:16:39,750 --> 02:16:40,950
and I'm just like, what do I want to do?

3120
02:16:40,950 --> 02:16:42,549
Maybe you might say it again.

3121
02:16:42,549 --> 02:16:43,670
Of course you will because I bought them.

3122
02:16:51,799 --> 02:16:53,000
But that's what we'll call it tonight.

3123
02:16:55,600 --> 02:16:57,040
And you will see me again.

3124
02:16:57,040 --> 02:16:58,559
I have this weekend.

3125
02:16:59,360 --> 02:17:05,120
I have actually Otto has to go in for a surgery.

3126
02:17:06,280 --> 02:17:07,239
Otto has surgery.

3127
02:17:08,899 --> 02:17:11,299
He's getting his teeth cleaned

3128
02:17:12,260 --> 02:17:18,260
and he also is getting a small little growth removed from his knee.

3129
02:17:20,049 --> 02:17:22,290
So take care of Otto.

3130
02:17:29,670 --> 02:17:30,790
It's very, very small.

3131
02:17:34,120 --> 02:17:34,920
Tooth removal?

3132
02:17:34,920 --> 02:17:36,280
No, no, no, just teeth cleaning.

3133
02:17:38,340 --> 02:17:39,540
I've worded that wrong.

3134
02:17:39,540 --> 02:17:40,899
He's getting his teeth cleaned

3135
02:17:41,780 --> 02:17:45,459
and then they're going to remove a small growth on his knee.

3136
02:17:45,459 --> 02:17:45,940
There you go.

3137
02:17:48,340 --> 02:17:50,500
Brushing your teeth is not surgery.

3138
02:17:51,479 --> 02:17:52,200
The other one is.

3139
02:17:54,370 --> 02:17:55,489
But you'll see me again.

3140
02:17:55,489 --> 02:17:57,889
I did make a promise that I have to keep

3141
02:17:58,930 --> 02:18:04,209
and that promise is on Tuesday we're going to start with DOS.

3142
02:18:04,209 --> 02:18:05,809
We're going to do another DOS night.

3143
02:18:05,809 --> 02:18:08,850
I did say I have to at least have my word be real

3144
02:18:08,850 --> 02:18:10,049
for some of the things I said.

3145
02:18:11,090 --> 02:18:13,010
We're going to go back to DOS on Tuesday.

3146
02:18:17,430 --> 02:18:18,069
Tuesday.

3147
02:18:21,829 --> 02:18:23,510
There's apparently been a ton of new additions.

3148
02:18:25,920 --> 02:18:26,879
Check it out.

3149
02:18:26,879 --> 02:18:29,670
Am I leaving?

3150
02:18:29,670 --> 02:18:31,670
Yeah, that's what I'm going to call it.

3151
02:18:31,670 --> 02:18:32,629
That was the plan tonight.

3152
02:18:33,909 --> 02:18:35,190
We had these two games lined up.

3153
02:18:35,909 --> 02:18:40,879
Play Ultima 4 maybe.

3154
02:18:41,600 --> 02:18:47,059
No, we did Nancy Drew last night.

3155
02:18:47,059 --> 02:18:48,899
Can't do two Nancy Drews in a row.

3156
02:18:49,780 --> 02:18:51,250
Got to space it out a little.

3157
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:53,719
That was a lot of fun.

3158
02:18:54,600 --> 02:18:55,719
I think Train Game was...

3159
02:18:57,829 --> 02:18:59,909
I think they were equally as interesting.

3160
02:18:59,909 --> 02:19:03,030
I think Train Game was a little more engaging in a way.

3161
02:19:03,670 --> 02:19:04,309
But not really.

3162
02:19:04,309 --> 02:19:05,590
I mean, they're both fun.

3163
02:19:07,010 --> 02:19:08,850
That was Tools Up.

3164
02:19:09,649 --> 02:19:11,729
Which, by the way, if you're going to buy Tools Up,

3165
02:19:11,729 --> 02:19:13,329
just be really aware of this.

3166
02:19:13,329 --> 02:19:15,409
There's no online multiplayer.

3167
02:19:15,409 --> 02:19:16,770
You have to do Steam Remote Play.

3168
02:19:16,770 --> 02:19:18,129
That's the only way you get it to work.

3169
02:19:18,129 --> 02:19:19,250
Or Couch Co-op.

3170
02:19:19,250 --> 02:19:21,569
So if you're like, oh, I wanted to play that with one of my friends.

3171
02:19:21,569 --> 02:19:22,450
Oh, you'll get it.

3172
02:19:23,090 --> 02:19:26,340
You have to do the Remote Play.

3173
02:19:26,899 --> 02:19:27,780
That was not online.

3174
02:19:30,159 --> 02:19:31,200
This one is on rail.

3175
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:32,000
This one is online.

3176
02:19:35,969 --> 02:19:37,809
And it was pretty fun.

3177
02:19:38,920 --> 02:19:40,040
I think this is an early access.

3178
02:19:40,040 --> 02:19:41,799
This just came out in early access, didn't it?

3179
02:19:43,250 --> 02:19:43,809
It's pretty good.

3180
02:19:44,450 --> 02:19:49,459
But we'll see you in a few days.

3181
02:19:51,750 --> 02:19:52,950
Tuesday, to be exact.

3182
02:19:53,510 --> 02:19:57,250
I'm going to go take care of Otto.

3183
02:19:58,850 --> 02:20:01,729
I will give him all of your love and mine.

3184
02:20:02,370 --> 02:20:07,319
This looks like an awesome mobile game.

3185
02:20:09,729 --> 02:20:14,690
Yeah, but isn't an awesome mobile game just a good game, you know?

3186
02:20:15,569 --> 02:20:18,790
That's not, it's all right.

3187
02:20:18,790 --> 02:20:19,590
It was fun.

3188
02:20:22,719 --> 02:20:23,040
No.

3189
02:20:23,840 --> 02:20:24,079
No.

3190
02:20:24,799 --> 02:20:28,389
But thanks again for watching.

3191
02:20:29,030 --> 02:20:30,239
See you Tuesday.

3192
02:20:31,430 --> 02:20:32,069
We'll do the bits.

3193
02:20:33,190 --> 02:20:36,389
I have to get this train sound off my computer.

3194
02:20:37,030 --> 02:20:42,100
Because it's still just here to exit the game.

3195
02:20:45,170 --> 02:20:47,729
Back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back.

3196
02:20:47,729 --> 02:20:48,049
Quit.

3197
02:20:48,610 --> 02:20:51,170
It's still playing.

3198
02:20:51,170 --> 02:20:51,569
There we go.

3199
02:20:53,350 --> 02:20:53,670
All right.

3200
02:20:53,670 --> 02:20:56,469
Let's go back about where were we?

3201
02:20:56,469 --> 02:20:57,350
Four, five hours?

3202
02:20:57,350 --> 02:20:58,069
Five hours ago.

3203
02:20:59,190 --> 02:21:09,299
Where were we at?

3204
02:21:10,340 --> 02:21:12,819
I'm actually surprised that Steam Remote Play held up that well.

3205
02:21:13,540 --> 02:21:20,370
I guess you just, you have to have a good connection to the people that you're playing with.

3206
02:21:20,370 --> 02:21:26,399
And the three of us are in a, you know, that Southwest sort of location.

3207
02:21:28,399 --> 02:21:32,159
I wonder how bad that would be if I would play with somebody from the East Coast or from Europe.

3208
02:21:32,159 --> 02:21:33,360
It would probably be horrible.

3209
02:21:35,920 --> 02:21:36,239
Maybe.

3210
02:21:36,239 --> 02:21:36,719
I don't know.

3211
02:21:36,719 --> 02:21:37,920
I don't have any experience with it, so.

3212
02:21:40,920 --> 02:21:43,879
But thank you to extra cheesy for the 500 bits.

3213
02:21:44,680 --> 02:21:49,040
What you didn't know was that I was the true player one this entire time.

3214
02:21:49,040 --> 02:21:52,799
I was controlling you, controlling the game, controlling their streams.

3215
02:21:53,360 --> 02:21:56,799
Just as right now I'm controlling you to read this.

3216
02:21:56,799 --> 02:22:00,799
I am Shrek and the universe is my onion, not yours.

3217
02:22:01,520 --> 02:22:08,159
I don't understand that last sentence, but thank you for the 500 bits.

3218
02:22:12,120 --> 02:22:13,079
Abomination zero.

3219
02:22:13,079 --> 02:22:13,959
Thanks to the 250.

3220
02:22:14,600 --> 02:22:16,280
Hygermia streams mean a lot to me.

3221
02:22:16,280 --> 02:22:19,479
My home life can be pretty shitty, but you make the nights more fun.

3222
02:22:20,040 --> 02:22:20,930
Don't ever change.

3223
02:22:21,649 --> 02:22:25,879
I don't really plan on it.

3224
02:22:26,440 --> 02:22:33,350
And I think I don't think I have the mental capacity to be able to do it.

3225
02:22:35,139 --> 02:22:37,590
So I really appreciate that.

3226
02:22:37,590 --> 02:22:38,950
Thank you so much for the 250.

3227
02:22:40,530 --> 02:22:42,930
Hopefully that home life can improve.

3228
02:22:43,649 --> 02:22:46,739
Thanks a lot for the 250.

3229
02:22:46,739 --> 02:22:47,540
Abomination zero.

3230
02:22:50,260 --> 02:22:50,979
Coldest fridge.

3231
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:53,680
Thanks for the 500 bits.

3232
02:22:54,719 --> 02:22:56,799
Hey, Jerma, I hope you didn't forget what day it is today.

3233
02:22:57,440 --> 02:22:58,399
I did not.

3234
02:22:58,399 --> 02:23:00,319
We'll address that in a few minutes, though.

3235
02:23:00,319 --> 02:23:02,680
We'll address that in a few minutes.

3236
02:23:08,340 --> 02:23:09,219
It's a birthday today.

3237
02:23:18,389 --> 02:23:19,510
How old are you again?

3238
02:23:21,319 --> 02:23:21,879
How old are you?

3239
02:23:27,559 --> 02:23:28,120
19.

3240
02:23:29,379 --> 02:23:30,100
No, no, right.

3241
02:23:30,100 --> 02:23:31,299
Do you remember we tried to figure that out?

3242
02:23:32,100 --> 02:23:36,930
It's also my dad's birthday.

3243
02:23:36,930 --> 02:23:38,290
Happy birthday to your dad, too.

3244
02:23:44,340 --> 02:23:46,260
Hope you've been such a good boy this year.

3245
02:23:50,229 --> 02:23:51,270
Thanks for the 500 bits.

3246
02:23:52,959 --> 02:23:54,559
Happy fucking birthday.

3247
02:23:57,329 --> 02:23:59,489
To everybody that has a birthday today.

3248
02:24:02,370 --> 02:24:03,250
Not just one person.

3249
02:24:08,719 --> 02:24:10,559
How many people actually have a birthday here today?

3250
02:24:11,040 --> 02:24:14,420
Let's see.

3251
02:24:14,420 --> 02:24:18,819
One, two, three, four, five.

3252
02:24:18,819 --> 02:24:19,860
Quite a lot of us, actually.

3253
02:24:20,500 --> 02:24:23,889
Thanks for the 500 bits.

3254
02:24:24,770 --> 02:24:25,649
I don't forget.

3255
02:24:26,530 --> 02:24:27,729
I mean, I always forget,

3256
02:24:27,729 --> 02:24:29,729
but as long as I'm reminded every single day,

3257
02:24:32,020 --> 02:24:34,819
I will not forget if each day I'm told not to forget

3258
02:24:34,819 --> 02:24:36,020
until the day that it happens.

3259
02:24:36,659 --> 02:24:39,239
Thanks for the 500 bits.

3260
02:24:39,799 --> 02:24:42,659
Appreciate it.

3261
02:24:42,659 --> 02:24:45,170
Your birthday's tomorrow.

3262
02:24:45,170 --> 02:24:46,610
Happy birthday tomorrow.

3263
02:24:46,610 --> 02:24:50,069
I have to be reminded every day.

3264
02:24:50,870 --> 02:24:53,200
That's ADHD.

3265
02:24:53,200 --> 02:24:53,680
Yes, it is.

3266
02:24:58,479 --> 02:24:59,840
DarkSoul250, thanks for the...

3267
02:25:02,899 --> 02:25:04,420
DarkSoul, thanks for the 250.

3268
02:25:06,520 --> 02:25:07,959
Even though this week isn't real

3269
02:25:07,959 --> 02:25:09,559
and we're all in comas, it's been a lot of fun.

3270
02:25:10,200 --> 02:25:12,420
I'll see you all when we wake up.

3271
02:25:13,459 --> 02:25:15,299
Also, my mother legitimately wanted to know

3272
02:25:15,299 --> 02:25:16,500
why it took you eight hours

3273
02:25:16,500 --> 02:25:18,340
to beat a Nancy Drew game, by the way.

3274
02:25:20,959 --> 02:25:22,159
Because it was a long-ass game.

3275
02:25:31,139 --> 02:25:32,100
Midnight in Salem.

3276
02:25:32,100 --> 02:25:32,819
How long...

3277
02:25:32,819 --> 02:25:34,819
It's like a 10-hour game.

3278
02:25:35,620 --> 02:25:40,149
How long to beat Nancy Drew in Salem?

3279
02:25:43,280 --> 02:25:44,079
Nancy Drew...

3280
02:25:47,280 --> 02:25:47,760
Salem.

3281
02:25:47,840 --> 02:25:48,319
What's it called?

3282
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:51,680
How long is Nancy Drew...

3283
02:25:52,479 --> 02:25:54,360
No, that's not right.

3284
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,319
Midnight in Salem.

3285
02:26:01,510 --> 02:26:02,950
I'm the only person that's beaten the game,

3286
02:26:02,950 --> 02:26:04,229
so it's a seven-and-a-half-hour game.

3287
02:26:04,790 --> 02:26:15,510
But thank you, DarkSoul250, appreciate it.

3288
02:26:15,510 --> 02:26:18,549
UtopiaFox gave 10 community subs.

3289
02:26:18,549 --> 02:26:19,909
I think I missed one of them,

3290
02:26:19,909 --> 02:26:21,350
but I tried to catch them both.

3291
02:26:22,149 --> 02:26:24,069
That's the one thing when you stream

3292
02:26:24,069 --> 02:26:25,750
and you play with other people

3293
02:26:26,629 --> 02:26:28,149
and there's more than one person,

3294
02:26:28,149 --> 02:26:29,350
you have to find that minute

3295
02:26:29,350 --> 02:26:30,709
where you can just mute everybody

3296
02:26:31,750 --> 02:26:32,629
and then they go, what are you doing?

3297
02:26:32,629 --> 02:26:33,270
And it's like, I'm talking...

3298
02:26:34,069 --> 02:26:34,950
Hey, pick up...

3299
02:26:34,950 --> 02:26:35,670
What are you doing?

3300
02:26:35,670 --> 02:26:36,549
Are you stupid?

3301
02:26:36,549 --> 02:26:37,030
I'm trying to...

3302
02:26:37,989 --> 02:26:39,270
So it's easy to miss some stuff.

3303
02:26:39,270 --> 02:26:39,670
I'm sorry.

3304
02:26:40,469 --> 02:26:41,030
I'm sorry.

3305
02:26:41,989 --> 02:26:44,709
But thank you, Cole, KaoLegacy,

3306
02:26:44,709 --> 02:26:45,829
and UtopiaFox.

3307
02:26:45,829 --> 02:26:46,549
I think I got them,

3308
02:26:46,549 --> 02:26:47,350
but I'm just making sure.

3309
02:26:48,229 --> 02:26:51,239
Both the 10 community subs, appreciate it.

3310
02:26:51,239 --> 02:26:56,370
And we're talking about them.

3311
02:26:56,370 --> 02:26:57,909
Why don't we show them all?

3312
02:27:06,770 --> 02:27:08,450
Thank you so much, everybody, for your subs.

3313
02:27:13,489 --> 02:27:14,290
Really appreciate it.

3314
02:27:15,010 --> 02:27:19,030
Hey, that hurt.

3315
02:27:19,670 --> 02:27:23,440
I'm sorry, dude.

3316
02:27:23,440 --> 02:27:24,479
I'm sorry I didn't mean to bump you.

3317
02:27:27,430 --> 02:27:33,090
But again, thank you for subbing to this channel, as always.

3318
02:27:33,729 --> 02:27:38,309
We had a couple more bits come in.

3319
02:27:38,309 --> 02:27:40,069
We had TalksRay for 250.

3320
02:27:40,629 --> 02:27:43,190
Dingo the Dinosaur for Jerma Rumble, Jerma Venus.

3321
02:27:44,229 --> 02:27:47,829
We'll see.

3322
02:27:48,629 --> 02:27:50,309
We'll see.

3323
02:27:50,870 --> 02:27:54,719
Hey, DubskiDude, thanks for the 250.

3324
02:27:54,719 --> 02:27:56,319
Hey, Jerma, please don't ban me for this.

3325
02:27:56,959 --> 02:27:58,479
But I had to make a Reddit thread

3326
02:27:58,479 --> 02:27:59,840
about all the questionable stuff

3327
02:27:59,840 --> 02:28:00,799
you've been doing lately.

3328
02:28:01,360 --> 02:28:04,559
The thread got 700 upvotes and a few awards.

3329
02:28:05,200 --> 02:28:05,920
So I'm not the only one

3330
02:28:05,920 --> 02:28:07,360
who is concerned about your behavior.

3331
02:28:07,920 --> 02:28:09,680
I'm not subbed, so I can't link it.

3332
02:28:09,680 --> 02:28:10,959
But just look for the thread title

3333
02:28:10,959 --> 02:28:13,920
What's With All The Jerma Controversies.

3334
02:28:13,920 --> 02:28:15,120
I don't want to spread drama.

3335
02:28:15,120 --> 02:28:15,920
I really don't.

3336
02:28:15,920 --> 02:28:17,120
But someone has to say it.

3337
02:28:17,120 --> 02:28:18,719
I hope you can get back on track.

3338
02:28:20,079 --> 02:28:27,719
Hey, guys.

3339
02:28:29,299 --> 02:28:30,260
Oh, my God.

3340
02:28:31,139 --> 02:28:34,579
This is like, this is a long page.

3341
02:28:34,579 --> 02:28:36,020
Hey, guys, I'm kind of new to this community.

3342
02:28:36,020 --> 02:28:38,260
And I was really enjoying watching Jerma's content.

3343
02:28:38,260 --> 02:28:40,260
But I keep seeing talk of a bunch of controversies

3344
02:28:40,260 --> 02:28:40,819
he's been in.

3345
02:28:41,700 --> 02:28:43,860
It's weird because Jerma's a likable down-to-earth guy.

3346
02:28:43,860 --> 02:28:45,139
So it really doesn't make sense to me.

3347
02:28:45,860 --> 02:28:47,940
I'll list what I've been seeing lately so we can discuss.

3348
02:28:48,899 --> 02:28:53,649
Jerma regularly forces chat to sit through ad breaks.

3349
02:28:54,450 --> 02:28:55,649
I guess this one isn't so bad

3350
02:28:55,649 --> 02:28:57,250
because he does have to put food on the table.

3351
02:28:57,250 --> 02:28:59,250
But I'm not sure why Jerma drops so many ad breaks

3352
02:28:59,250 --> 02:29:00,930
when he already gets a ton of bits and subs.

3353
02:29:01,489 --> 02:29:04,129
He just randomly throws an ad break in whenever he wants.

3354
02:29:04,129 --> 02:29:06,209
I think one time he kept doing them over and over

3355
02:29:06,209 --> 02:29:07,889
and only stopping people started leaving.

3356
02:29:08,690 --> 02:29:09,969
He also doesn't.

3357
02:29:10,770 --> 02:29:12,920
Oh, so now this is real.

3358
02:29:12,920 --> 02:29:13,639
Okay, I get it.

3359
02:29:15,350 --> 02:29:16,709
This is a, okay.

3360
02:29:17,670 --> 02:29:21,600
That running ads in a row until people left.

3361
02:29:21,600 --> 02:29:22,719
I'm like, when did I do that?

3362
02:29:25,920 --> 02:29:28,079
Jerma's acting toxic towards his fans,

3363
02:29:28,079 --> 02:29:29,520
calling them stupid fucking idiot,

3364
02:29:29,520 --> 02:29:31,200
dumb fucking goddamn idiots.

3365
02:29:31,200 --> 02:29:32,319
Motherfuckers.

3366
02:29:32,319 --> 02:29:34,399
And threatening to permanently ban people over nothing.

3367
02:29:35,120 --> 02:29:37,680
I think I might have seen a few people get banned for outright

3368
02:29:37,680 --> 02:29:39,520
for just recalling him short, which is rude.

3369
02:29:39,520 --> 02:29:41,040
But perma-banning is overkill.

3370
02:29:45,040 --> 02:29:47,600
This is just a, what the fuck?

3371
02:29:49,250 --> 02:29:52,049
Jerma encouraging his fans to spam comment threads

3372
02:29:52,049 --> 02:29:54,049
that he beat Dark Souls 3 on stream.

3373
02:29:54,690 --> 02:29:57,620
I have firsthand experience seeing people do this

3374
02:29:57,620 --> 02:29:59,219
on Reddit, YouTube, and MySpace.

3375
02:29:59,780 --> 02:30:01,219
So I know that's likely true.

3376
02:30:03,879 --> 02:30:05,000
All right, that one's true.

3377
02:30:06,209 --> 02:30:09,969
But no, but the only true part about that is

3378
02:30:11,090 --> 02:30:14,690
I said if somebody ever says Jerma died to Pinwheel,

3379
02:30:14,690 --> 02:30:17,170
which is a lie, then you need to counteract that

3380
02:30:17,170 --> 02:30:19,569
with no, he didn't, he beat Dark Souls 3 on stream.

3381
02:30:20,610 --> 02:30:21,329
That's all I said.

3382
02:30:21,329 --> 02:30:22,850
I didn't say to go spamming him.

3383
02:30:22,850 --> 02:30:23,569
Why would I say that?

3384
02:30:24,209 --> 02:30:28,209
I'm saying if you see counteract the complete false misinformation.

3385
02:30:28,850 --> 02:30:34,420
Jerma was doing cruel IRL pranks.

3386
02:30:34,420 --> 02:30:36,579
I remember one time Jerma did a video where he bought

3387
02:30:36,579 --> 02:30:39,540
a bunch of cakes and threw them at random dock workers.

3388
02:30:40,340 --> 02:30:42,260
I guess it was supposed to be a reference to TF2.

3389
02:30:42,260 --> 02:30:43,700
He ended up hitting a guy right in the face

3390
02:30:43,700 --> 02:30:46,180
and it dazed him to where he couldn't walk straight.

3391
02:30:46,180 --> 02:30:47,299
It was really graphic.

3392
02:30:48,340 --> 02:30:52,200
Jerma talking about his personal fetishes on stream.

3393
02:30:53,520 --> 02:30:56,399
Like getting his chest hairs plucked with tweezers and CBT.

3394
02:30:57,440 --> 02:30:58,000
And eating.

3395
02:30:58,719 --> 02:31:00,319
I personally wasn't around for that stuff,

3396
02:31:00,319 --> 02:31:01,360
but it sounds like it was gross.

3397
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
Some people are just really open, okay?

3398
02:31:05,860 --> 02:31:07,540
Talk shit about his best friends

3399
02:31:07,540 --> 02:31:09,299
and scams them out of a lot of money.

3400
02:31:10,579 --> 02:31:12,899
I remember Starr and Jerma collabs.

3401
02:31:12,899 --> 02:31:14,260
It's really sad to see they had split up,

3402
02:31:14,260 --> 02:31:16,260
but I didn't know that Jerma had stolen money from him.

3403
02:31:19,010 --> 02:31:22,709
Dude, if you would just, there are so many just lies

3404
02:31:22,709 --> 02:31:23,590
in this community.

3405
02:31:23,590 --> 02:31:27,190
It's like, there's nobody can know the truth now.

3406
02:31:27,190 --> 02:31:29,030
There's so many falsehoods.

3407
02:31:31,090 --> 02:31:32,530
Even coming from me too.

3408
02:31:33,250 --> 02:31:39,569
Jerma harassing a streamer called GrillmasterXBBQ.

3409
02:31:40,129 --> 02:31:41,649
I only caught the last half of the incident,

3410
02:31:41,649 --> 02:31:43,010
but Jerma seriously went off the rails

3411
02:31:43,010 --> 02:31:44,770
and was talking mad shit about him.

3412
02:31:44,770 --> 02:31:47,329
I don't even know who he was until he went ape shit on him.

3413
02:31:47,329 --> 02:31:49,569
I think Twitch admins might have told Jerma to lay off.

3414
02:31:50,770 --> 02:31:54,440
Jerma burning a live Wasp on stream.

3415
02:31:54,440 --> 02:31:57,079
That was fake CGI.

3416
02:32:00,979 --> 02:32:03,219
Everyone in the comments is talking about how much of a psycho I am.

3417
02:32:06,049 --> 02:32:07,969
Okay, down in the comments threads.

3418
02:32:07,969 --> 02:32:11,569
I also find it idiotic that he tried to copyright the planets

3419
02:32:11,569 --> 02:32:13,090
of the fucking solar system.

3420
02:32:13,090 --> 02:32:13,969
Like, what are you, what?

3421
02:32:14,690 --> 02:32:16,450
Glad that shit got shot down right away.

3422
02:32:16,450 --> 02:32:17,729
But seriously, what kind of freak thinks

3423
02:32:17,729 --> 02:32:19,170
he can just copyright planets?

3424
02:32:19,729 --> 02:32:20,610
Delusional much?

3425
02:32:21,569 --> 02:32:24,930
Anyway, his stupid juke spamming fans pretend to be...

3426
02:32:34,180 --> 02:32:35,059
This is like all...

3427
02:32:35,700 --> 02:32:40,899
I heard he also killed Glooman.

3428
02:32:40,899 --> 02:32:42,899
Glooman's still alive, so that's not real.

3429
02:32:43,620 --> 02:32:46,770
I love this post.

3430
02:32:46,770 --> 02:32:47,489
I'm calling it now.

3431
02:32:47,489 --> 02:32:49,489
Someone thirsty for drama is going to read this post

3432
02:32:49,489 --> 02:32:52,530
and take it seriously and then make a YouTube video on it

3433
02:32:52,530 --> 02:32:54,290
without realizing it's satire.

3434
02:33:12,850 --> 02:33:14,930
This does have 700 uploads, though.

3435
02:33:15,729 --> 02:33:17,200
Here, if you want to go through...

3436
02:33:17,760 --> 02:33:19,600
If you want to go through all the horrible things I've done

3437
02:33:19,600 --> 02:33:20,879
in my career, there it is.

3438
02:33:21,840 --> 02:33:28,389
And that was DubskiDude.

3439
02:33:28,389 --> 02:33:29,190
Thank you, DubskiDude.

3440
02:33:29,989 --> 02:33:33,360
Where's my apology?

3441
02:33:33,360 --> 02:33:41,110
I'll see you guys on Tuesday.

3442
02:33:47,239 --> 02:33:51,670
Public apology required now.

3443
02:33:52,790 --> 02:33:54,309
That was not a good apology.

3444
02:33:55,270 --> 02:33:56,549
Okay, sure, guys.

3445
02:33:56,629 --> 02:33:59,909
I'm sorry for the made-up things about me.

3446
02:34:01,030 --> 02:34:04,559
But doesn't that happen in a lot of apologies?

3447
02:34:05,200 --> 02:34:06,879
Guys, I just got to tell you, I'm sorry,

3448
02:34:06,879 --> 02:34:08,799
but all these things are made up about me.

3449
02:34:10,319 --> 02:34:11,120
That does happen.

3450
02:34:11,120 --> 02:34:11,840
That just happens.

3451
02:34:18,399 --> 02:34:22,239
Guys, just want to hit you with some stuff going on.

3452
02:34:22,239 --> 02:34:23,600
I want to just say I'm very sorry

3453
02:34:24,159 --> 02:34:25,760
for the way that you all feel about me

3454
02:34:25,760 --> 02:34:27,040
and how none of it's real.

3455
02:34:27,040 --> 02:34:27,680
It's not true.

3456
02:34:27,680 --> 02:34:28,180
Sorry.

3457
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:32,719
All right.

3458
02:34:33,280 --> 02:34:41,030
Everyone deserves a second chance.

3459
02:34:41,030 --> 02:34:41,530
Thank you.

3460
02:34:42,090 --> 02:34:43,370
Thank you, MessingY.

3461
02:34:44,489 --> 02:34:44,989
Thank you.

3462
02:34:45,610 --> 02:34:52,500
See you guys on Tuesday.

3463
02:34:53,139 --> 02:34:56,899
Thanks for watching the week of non-canon streams.

3464
02:34:58,020 --> 02:35:01,909
Some of those could be retroactively canon, I think.

3465
02:35:02,549 --> 02:35:03,510
Maybe one or two of them.

3466
02:35:03,510 --> 02:35:04,309
What was it, four?

3467
02:35:04,309 --> 02:35:05,270
Last four days in a row?

3468
02:35:06,309 --> 02:35:07,590
Maybe two of those were canon.

3469
02:35:08,549 --> 02:35:13,190
Good night, guys.

3470
02:35:13,750 --> 02:35:15,420
See you Tuesday.

3471
02:35:32,440 --> 02:35:35,219
I'm not going to turn the stream off yet

3472
02:35:35,219 --> 02:35:37,139
because it's at four hours and 59 minutes.

3473
02:35:38,180 --> 02:35:41,459
And I want this to be a five-hour stream.

3474
02:35:42,100 --> 02:35:43,700
Because that's just going to bug me.

3475
02:35:47,209 --> 02:35:52,200
Padding your stats by 20, 30 seconds.

3476
02:35:52,760 --> 02:35:54,840
Add it to the list of controversies.

3477
02:35:55,559 --> 02:36:02,969
You gaming analytics now.

3478
02:36:06,540 --> 02:36:07,040
All right.

3479
02:36:07,659 --> 02:36:08,459
Good night, guys.

3480
02:36:08,459 --> 02:36:09,100
See you Tuesday.

3481
02:36:24,120 --> 02:36:26,360
Real quick, C4G, thanks for the 250.

3482
02:36:27,079 --> 02:36:28,600
The company that made House Flipper

3483
02:36:28,600 --> 02:36:30,200
and Car Mechanics in me later

3484
02:36:30,200 --> 02:36:32,360
appeared to be publishing a Jesus game.

3485
02:36:33,319 --> 02:36:37,450
It has a Steam page, but the trailer looks like

3486
02:36:37,450 --> 02:36:39,530
it's a fake game from a Coke commercial.

3487
02:36:41,610 --> 02:36:42,110
What?

3488
02:36:42,729 --> 02:36:50,700
All right, goodbye.

3489
02:36:51,899 --> 02:36:52,399
Goodbye.

3490
02:36:54,329 --> 02:36:54,829
Goodbye.

3491
02:37:00,569 --> 02:37:01,610
No, I'm out of here.

3492
02:37:09,030 --> 02:37:10,309
I am Jesus...

3493
02:37:10,950 --> 02:37:13,670
Am Jesus Christ is the name of the game.

3494
02:37:14,469 --> 02:37:18,870
No, I don't want to show this trailer.

3495
02:37:19,590 --> 02:37:21,190
Because I want to be...

3496
02:37:21,190 --> 02:37:23,110
I don't want to know anything about this.

3497
02:37:23,110 --> 02:37:23,610
Nope.

3498
02:37:23,610 --> 02:37:24,309
No, no, no, no, no.

3499
02:37:24,309 --> 02:37:25,510
If you want to look, go for it.

3500
02:37:25,590 --> 02:37:26,069
I don't want to.

3501
02:37:26,709 --> 02:37:27,209
Nope.

3502
02:37:33,959 --> 02:37:35,319
I don't want to see a damn thing about this.

3503
02:37:45,530 --> 02:37:48,469
I've skipped 10 seconds into that trailer

3504
02:37:48,469 --> 02:37:50,309
and I immediately do not want to see anything else.

3505
02:37:52,840 --> 02:37:53,340
No way.

3506
02:37:55,620 --> 02:37:56,340
Whenever that comes out,

3507
02:37:56,340 --> 02:38:02,819
we're gonna have to think about playing that one.

3508
02:38:02,819 --> 02:38:04,260
Thank you, C4G, for the 250.

3509
02:38:04,260 --> 02:38:09,620
And look, it's 501, which is somehow worse than 459.

3510
02:38:10,260 --> 02:38:13,690
God damn it.

3511
02:38:13,690 --> 02:38:14,489
All right, see you Tuesday.

3512
02:38:14,489 --> 02:38:15,290
Goodbye.
