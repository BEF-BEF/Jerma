1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:15,109
Hello, I'm very early. Yeah, I'm very extraordinarily early by like an hour. Hi everybody. What the fuck dude?

2
00:00:15,109 --> 00:00:21,030
I was making food and now you're live and I can't even make my food anymore. No, you can't we're gonna hang out

3
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:26,469
We're just gonna chill for like a few minutes. You've got time to microwave the hot pocket. What do they take two minutes?

4
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:32,729
You're not making like spaghetti and meatballs or something. Are you? I mean that takes a long time. That takes like an hour or two

5
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,700
I can't even read this

6
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,619
It's it's too fast

7
00:00:45,619 --> 00:00:48,549
This is the it's too fast. I can't read it. It's too fast

8
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:54,969
uh

9
00:00:54,969 --> 00:00:56,969
Jerma, hi. Hey, how are you?

10
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:59,719
Jerma sucks. Hey

11
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:01,560
Hey

12
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,880
Happy new year. Yeah, happy. Well, not yet. Not yet

13
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,849
I figured I would start a little early just because I was thinking about it

14
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,420
and

15
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,420
If I started at 6 30

16
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:18,019
Because I want to hit eastern time right like the new york city. That's when the ball drops the big ball in new york city

17
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:18,980
right

18
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,060
I want to hit eastern time

19
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,980
so

20
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:28,739
That's only like two out what six thirty seven or eight nine thirty ten thirty eleven thirty. That's only two and a half hours

21
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,739
This we got 19 categories to go through and an entire rumble card

22
00:01:35,379 --> 00:01:39,620
So this might be a little longer than I initially anticipated. So let's start early

23
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,500
Get going

24
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,420
I can't even count these subscribers. Oh my god

25
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:50,840
five

26
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,939
I can count them

27
00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:57,260
This all right. I don't the number just jumped up

28
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:02,040
Anyways, let's just hang out for a little bit. I've got all the categories got everything ready to go

29
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,439
And I hey

Not really flashy this year

58
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:20,980
These are just on security envelopes written in crayon and I spelt them and I spelt it wrong after a great start

59
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:31,199
All right. Listen to me. I i'm drinking a cbd drink. All right, it's cbd thc

60
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:41,560
Mean alcohol. I don't want any alcohol. I spelled character wrong, but I you know, I knew it

61
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,560
I didn't even care because I didn't want to make a new envelope

62
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:47,319
So I was just like what if I don't want to cross that out? I don't care. It doesn't matter

63
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:57,670
Uh, people give it a shitload of subs what we got here. Oh and also

00:05:58,069 --> 00:06:00,389
Super daza making fucking all these videos

00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:15,430
Unbelievable work. We had 10 community subs from lexie's five from cast tax five from hole of one zombie 50 dollars

Uh, there's so many community subs coming and I don't know what to do

72
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:42,490
Thank you for the insane amount of support completely unnecessary

73
00:06:43,129 --> 00:06:47,529
Don't have to do this. You guys give me fucking trillions of dollars

74
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,370
That asterisk there's an asterisk on that because it's not actually trillions

75
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:56,009
But you know, it's as an asterisk. It's actually like it's not that much but it is a lot

76
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,250
It's not over a trillion though

77
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:05,829
If it was I would I would buy a fucking island and make videos on it. You're the richest streamer on twitch

78
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:16,420
That's not true. Well gonna need to pay off that debt somehow. I don't like this. I don't like where this is

79
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:27,959

80
00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:37,959
It's gonna keep bumping into my drink. Whatever i'm gonna have to i'll put the drink over here. Yeah, that makes sense

And swallow it really quickly. I've done it like probably 30 times in the last two years

159
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:37,149
And um, I don't know. I don't know why I do it. I just think it's funny. So here's a compilation. This is this is uh,

160
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:42,639
Is the best one of this year apparently and I didn't even realize how many nominees were on this list

161
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:49,840
I do this too much. I I don't care. I'm gonna continue to do it. So that's that's just the way it is

162
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:55,309
Ladies and gentlemen, here come the nominees for best cat puke of the year

163
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:07,929
This is a water tank. What?

164
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,509
That's my special it's my

165
00:16:33,149 --> 00:16:34,750
cotton arm

166
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:38,990
And cat puke pizza. You have to make the noise now. No, I can't I can't

167
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:43,399
Finally a free drink

168
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,340
Come on I can do it. Come on

169
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:10,859
This one was just one over the road

170
00:17:27,309 --> 00:17:48,299
I I don't I I don't know why this that was my favorite category. Ladies and gentlemen, the winner of best cat puke for 2020

171
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:52,519
Oh, it's I don't even know which one this was I forgot already

172
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,869
it is

173
00:17:55,869 --> 00:18:00,269
One more for the road from bug snacks at 20.09 percent of the vote

174
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:03,359
Underneath that is the water tank

175
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,920
with the 15.5 percent

176
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,519
And then underneath that one is trying to stop the water

177
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:22,140
At 14.4.6 percent now you might be asking yourself. Why is that category on the list? Hey

178
00:18:22,779 --> 00:18:27,690
There ain't no worse peter this year. I can say peter as much as I want now

179
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,970
I can say peter every I could say it as much as I want. It's not even it's not on the list

180
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:34,920
It wasn't a category replaced it with something even worse

181
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:42,940
All right, this next one is uh, this next one is going to be very very fun for you not for me

182
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:51,579
Let's take a look at it. Now. What do you think? See i'm a human. I'm a normal guy

183
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,529
This is what my hair looks like sometimes

184
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,609
Uh, it doesn't look very good

185
00:18:57,609 --> 00:19:01,690
Sometimes it looks awful. Sometimes it looks so bad that I didn't i'm embarrassed

186
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:09,420
And a lot of people keep track of these and every year we try to find the worst case

187
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:17,000
Of bad hair that i've had for the entire year and there I think this year out of all the years

188
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:22,960
I think this is the worst year ever for this category. I think there was so many good ones

189
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:31,470
That this was tough. This was a tough one. Here are the nominees

190
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,910
worst hair of the year

191
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:59,289
Career is over. My my looks are over. It's over. It's over

192
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:05,420
It's over. I can't get a fucking haircut right now guys. Didn't you understand?

193
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,940
I didn't get a haircut in fucking february

194
00:20:10,329 --> 00:20:11,630
and

195
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:13,869
You look like hillary hillary clinton hair

196
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:16,589
hillary clinton hair

197
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,109
Airline check

198
00:20:18,109 --> 00:20:19,480
That's all right

199
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:33,769
Why is that even nominated every single fucking stream?

200
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:39,769
This just sand outside and I just i'm like, all right. I'm done with the broadcast today

201
00:20:40,569 --> 00:20:43,289
It's been swell. Okay. Good night everybody

202
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,799
And then 12 hours go by

203
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,240
Ah

204
00:20:50,240 --> 00:21:03,799
This overexposed camera too. Hey who who ordered the pizza?

205
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:08,670
Who ordered the bird's nest?

206
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:17,500
Okay, so

207
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,960
Uh, those are the nominees

208
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,960
I don't I don't think I really even have to uh

209
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:25,529
We don't even need a drum roll

210
00:21:25,529 --> 00:21:30,829
Um, I don't do I really need to tell you guys what the worst one was. Do you really not know?

211
00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:34,619
Should we even put it? I mean I guess uh for sure

212
00:21:35,579 --> 00:21:38,859
But it's the it's the worst hair i've ever had in my life not just

213
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:45,259
This year is the worst hair ever in my entire childhood all through my adult life is the worst hair i've ever had

214
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:55,119
Uh with forty four point six percent of the vote the winner

215
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:00,839
My career is over

216
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:02,200
when I took

217
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,200
the uh headband down

218
00:22:04,809 --> 00:22:06,940
My career is over

219
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:13,920
with forty four point six percent of the vote in second place was the mop comb over

220
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,279
Which was the one that was all that one was gross

221
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:26,329
Uh, that was nineteen point one four percent of the vote and then in third place was hillary clinton at thirteen point nine percent of the vote

222
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,660
There you go

223
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:35,640
Hillary got robbed

224
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:41,240
No, it didn't no it didn't. Oh, that's why i'm sorry. I am sorry, but 45 look at this

225
00:22:44,859 --> 00:22:53,039
Wait, what? Hey, that's so fucking bad guys

226
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:58,960
Like hillary clinton was my career is over my my looks are over my career was over

227
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,440
My career was over right there, but I built it back

228
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,640
uh

229
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,420
Yeah, that was that there's no question that you look 60. I looked 600

230
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:17,960
Like I was mummified and they found me buried in like a tomb somewhere. What's this next one?

231
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:22,359
Oh, all right. So we're gonna stay on this cat. We're gonna all right. We we've we've got four

232
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:26,720
This is fourth, right? Uh staying in the same realm of worst hair

233
00:23:27,549 --> 00:23:30,589
We have worst face and I held this up last year in a way like this

234
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,599
And people have tried to nominate that but i'm sorry that was not even a bad face

235
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,400
So we're gonna do this is we need real worst faces

236
00:23:40,089 --> 00:23:42,410
And what is the worst face if you don't if you're new to the channel or something?

237
00:23:43,309 --> 00:23:47,789
Uh, well sometimes when I go like this like if i'm scared at a video game or if there's something bad happens

238
00:23:47,789 --> 00:23:52,109
There's something scary or something weird or i'm losing my mind and I go like this like like you know

239
00:23:52,109 --> 00:23:56,059
I mean or I like freak out and like my I cringe up and stuff

240
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,720
Or it's just like somebody decides that I was ugly today and they take a screenshot of me

241
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:12,799
You're in the nominees for worst face of the year. See you in a sec

242
00:24:37,549 --> 00:24:42,430

00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:57,839

246
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:16,119
How about now? It's pretty bad

247
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,039
No, it's just weird. It's just gonna get like fucking weird

248
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:31,259
if i'm like

249
00:25:31,259 --> 00:25:33,259
Not even that bad

250
00:25:33,579 --> 00:25:37,339
That's what a toddler does when they know they did something wrong

251
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:47,950
That should be an emote stanley kubrick kubrick stare

252
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:59,609
It's fucking dark in here

253
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:04,089
So we were just sitting there and you're just spinning the thing around like all right. We win. We did it

254
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:07,130
What? I mean, I don't know

255
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:16,220
Go go go

256
00:26:16,539 --> 00:26:20,589
God

257
00:26:20,589 --> 00:26:22,589
That's what I can't explode

258
00:26:23,309 --> 00:26:33,240
Holy shit

259
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,880
Uh, so the winner of the worst face of the year category

260
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:43,099
This was uh, it wasn't that close. It was it really wasn't that close the winner

261
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,809
What do you think?

262
00:26:46,809 --> 00:26:58,140
What do you think with 28.8 percent of the vote? Who's the easy bake oven pizza face?

263
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:05,920
Coming in next at 14.7 percent was the kubrick stare

264
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:13,950
And then the wide grin was for 10.2 percent of the vote goblin got snubbed

265
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,089
Pretty hard. Yeah, I mean that's I mean the easy bake oven

266
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:27,819
Pizza tea thing that would mean it was it was revolting. It was disgusting. That was what lost by the most

267
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:31,420
Um, I don't think that's fair to that nominee

268
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:34,410
I don't think that's fair to that nominee

269
00:27:35,309 --> 00:27:39,599
And hey time is it we got a rumble

270
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:46,650
We've got multiple matches. Hopefully, uh, 2k20 does not uh fuck up on us

271
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:53,210
I would be very disappointed if it does but i'm ready to start the first match of the rumble

272
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:57,789
We have five matches including the rumble. We're going to be starting with this one first

273
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:06,680
Uh, just give me one second while I get it going and we'll get it on the first match of the rumble

In beautiful las vegas nevada also where i've been standing tried to make an official germa arena

280
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:44,109
Uh, but the game crashed every time I tried to change

The rope whoa don't want to spoil anything

282
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,660
Uh, the game crashed every time I changed the color of the ropes. I couldn't do my own arena

283
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,680
2k20 is horrible. All right, you ready for the first match?

00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:48,990
Whoever wins this match gets another stream

311
00:31:49,789 --> 00:31:51,470

Kiryu as you know from yakuza who's a zero to be exact

315
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,930
Gotta shut this guy up

316
00:32:06,089 --> 00:32:08,089
Also from new york

317
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:14,539
Yeah, why does it say you suck

318
00:32:14,619 --> 00:32:20,920
I think by the way, I gave him andre the giant's entrance

319
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:24,680
I think that's why he's walking so slow

320
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,160
They're all from the bronx. They're all from brooklyn

321
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:34,380
I don't think we can even do the betting right now. I like didn't set it up. It's all right

322
00:32:34,779 --> 00:32:37,819
Do it later do it uh, do it on uh betting

323
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,779
But uh, but who are they fighting against though? That's important

324
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,759
Who are they gonna fight against who would deserve another stream? What do you guys think?

325
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:52,440
There are two characters. I know that people are really really would love to see come back

326
00:32:53,789 --> 00:32:57,049
It's not bugsnax

327
00:32:57,529 --> 00:33:01,440
Not godhand

328
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,369
Not la noir

329
00:33:03,369 --> 00:33:07,119
Two beloved characters

330
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:08,799
You see one of them right now

331
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:13,769
The lights have just turned off

332
00:33:13,849 --> 00:33:18,089
Introducing for the second team of the who gets another stream match. It's salmon maps

333
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,680
I know a lot of you guys got stuff riding on this

334
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:40,519
So who's gonna win this is tornado tag, by the way, they're in the they're in there at the same time

335
00:33:41,079 --> 00:33:44,599
Oh, wait, we got a wait. We got a prediction

336
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:48,119
Win channel points. Oh shit. We got it

337
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:50,720
magima and kira versus sam and max

338
00:33:51,369 --> 00:33:53,369
both desperately want to see their

339
00:33:53,369 --> 00:33:55,369
respective franchises continue

340
00:33:55,369 --> 00:34:03,869
Let your channel points if you want to

341
00:34:03,869 --> 00:34:06,670
Who do you think is going to win this match? Oh what an entrance there?

342
00:34:08,409 --> 00:34:10,409
Flipping over the top rope

343
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,099
Just flying in

344
00:34:15,099 --> 00:34:17,099
Taking his time with his bird feet

345
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:24,090
Has to be a dog

346
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:25,610
13 14

347
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:28,360
14.8

348
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,050
To 11. Okay

349
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:32,489
Here comes sam

350
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:35,469
I mean max who's the bunny?

351
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:39,230
I really hope i'm not controlling a character because like I don't I didn't set it up that way

352
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:45,000
All right, get your drinks going

353
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:47,480
Alcoholic or non-alcoholic and here comes max

354
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:59,929
They all just live in a high rise in new york

355
00:35:00,409 --> 00:35:09,440
all of them it's like

356
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:12,909
60 apartments

357
00:35:12,909 --> 00:35:14,909
It's the germa house, but i'm not in new york

358
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:23,039
I'm gonna laugh so hard if I have to control a character because i'm gonna be pissed because i'm gonna have to restart it

359
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:32,889
He didn't have a shirt on

360
00:35:32,889 --> 00:35:35,769
Well, wait, he's a bunny so he doesn't have a shirt on

361
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:41,260
Okay, ladies and gentlemen, here comes the beginning of this match. We're gonna have sam and max versus kiryu

362
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,579
And how do I say that name?

363
00:35:43,579 --> 00:35:49,840
I'm saying it's so wrong

364
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,000
He has it kiryu. Okay kiryu

365
00:35:54,489 --> 00:35:58,489
Kiryu and majima versus sam and max again the winner of this competition gets another stream

366
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:04,219
Bonito tag matchup. They all have health on the bottom and here we go

367
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:08,300
All right off the bat sam with a flying leg kick

368
00:36:09,179 --> 00:36:11,179
Right into majima's face. They're also huge

369
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,269
Look at the referee

370
00:36:16,269 --> 00:36:18,429
Now there are rules here. There are rules

371
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,780
This is not a hardcore match

372
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:34,139
Snap suplex by majima onto sam right in his back and taunting is kiryu, which was a very very bad idea with his max

373
00:36:37,659 --> 00:36:41,659
Kicks him completely out of the ring in one boot. Is he gonna suplex him out of the ring? I'm not sure

374
00:36:41,659 --> 00:36:43,820
No, he's going to throw him on the on the top rope

375
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:45,739
and

376
00:36:45,739 --> 00:36:47,739
Knee him directly in his skull

377
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:52,670
Majima taking a little bit of punishment here. Well, kiryu comes back in and max is

378
00:36:53,289 --> 00:36:55,289
Absolutely destroying right now

379
00:36:57,219 --> 00:36:59,219
I don't think max has taken one punch

380
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:05,190
Sam has though

381
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:09,269
Nice dodge by max with the reversal into the triple shin kick

382
00:37:09,989 --> 00:37:12,309
He's going for the pin

383
00:37:12,309 --> 00:37:14,309
It's no way. It's way too early for that

384
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:22,599
Wait, did he just hit his head?

385
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:24,039
Now you would think

386
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:25,719
That hurricanrana

387
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:27,719
That's a good reversal there from kiryu

388
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:33,139
Max now in a little bit of trouble on the outside of the ropes here. Well sam and majima is still outside

389
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:37,699
And I think sam has just thrown majima back and forth three or four times

390
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:43,369
Why is nobody here?

391
00:37:43,369 --> 00:37:45,369
Why isn't nobody in the audience?

392
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:51,130
This event like

393
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,630
Max is carrying

394
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:57,989
I think I want to turn the I want to turn the hud off. I don't want to see the information

395
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:02,070
Looks like kiryu sent her for a powerbomb. Maybe no. He just let him go

396
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:04,980
He let him go

397
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,619
He keeps taunting

398
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:11,300
Now what I was gonna say earlier is you would think that sam and max would have the disadvantage here

399
00:38:12,099 --> 00:38:14,099
Because they're not really fighters

400
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:18,840
They're more investigators detectives. Although sam does have a gun

401
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,840
Ice suplex there by sam out of majima

402
00:38:23,659 --> 00:38:30,139
Kiryu working that skull cap of max majima looks like he's in a lot of trouble max isn't a lot of trouble too though

403
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:35,320
Setting it up here looks at onto the top rope. No, well, he's trying to think about what he wants to do with him

404
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,840
He's gonna throw about side of the ring

405
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,639
Nope just hit his face on that corner turnbuckle

406
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,460
Both of them want to see another scream so badly

407
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:48,869
Is sam going to submit here?

408
00:38:48,869 --> 00:38:53,429
We might see a submit no reversal punching a couple of times in the face right in the nose and then getting on

409
00:38:53,429 --> 00:38:56,309
Top of them doing a little twisty turn he can run up

410
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:03,320
A lot of reversals

411
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:07,480
If you take a look at the health bars down there you get to see max is in a lot of trouble big ddt

412
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,519
Doing a lot of taunting

413
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:14,599
We see from kiryu and majima

414
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:17,429
This does not look good for sam and max right now

415
00:39:21,989 --> 00:39:25,989
Big neck breaker, although kiryu is bringing him over into the corner here. I'm not sure what his plan is

416
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:32,010
Max blew all of his energy in the first 30 seconds of the match

417
00:39:32,889 --> 00:39:34,889
And he is almost toast

418
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,849
What?

419
00:39:39,849 --> 00:39:41,369
Why did he fall down?

420
00:39:41,369 --> 00:39:43,369
Are they gonna set up a double team move?

421
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:55,449
Majima win the first match of the evening

422
00:39:56,090 --> 00:40:01,380
Oh my god

423
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:04,340
He just broke every bone in his body

424
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,519
What?

425
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:08,519
When did he give him the stunner?

426
00:40:14,619 --> 00:40:19,500
Congratulations to kiryu and majima yakuza zero is going to get another stream

427
00:40:22,539 --> 00:40:27,420
We will see another stream from kiryu and majima. Sorry sam and max max. I think is dead

428
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,820
Oh

429
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,340
Oh, man

430
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:39,900
Did I heard like a bunch of bones break?

431
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,460
He weighs so much

432
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:44,860
Kiryu is like a 200 plus pound man

433
00:40:46,219 --> 00:40:48,219
And max is a bunny rabbit

434
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,880
He weighs like fucking four pounds

435
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:56,340
That was horrible

436
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:59,110
Okay

437
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:01,829
Well, uh, we can move on to the next match in a minute here

438
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:08,650
We're gonna do a couple more categories. That was the first match of the evening. I'm gonna turn this off

439
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:11,619
We're gonna keep this right here

440
00:41:11,619 --> 00:41:14,420
And I just like I blew schnauz out of my nose when he landed on him

441
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:17,139
I I really did. I like blew my nose like hard

442
00:41:17,699 --> 00:41:21,030
I don't want to don't wipe it on the I don't want to wipe it on the jacket. Hold on. What do I do?

443
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:29,800
38.7 million have been traded hands here. Congratulations. Those that have bet all right. Hold on a minute

444
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,440
I can't turn the camera until I I gotta oh, here we go. This is afghan writer

454
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:36,710

460
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:12,869
Sometimes it's good. Sometimes it's bad. The worst part about these categories is pay attention because it really doesn't matter

461
00:43:13,829 --> 00:43:15,829
What which one is worse than which one is best?

462
00:43:16,949 --> 00:43:21,190
It could be just flip them to any category you want there. It's all just kind of bad

But don't act like this dream is a toy

482
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:14,650
That was the worst

483
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:35,750
Put the kingdom hearts music back on oh

484
00:46:52,679 --> 00:46:54,679
I can't my voice is still fucked up

485
00:46:57,260 --> 00:47:01,690
I can't do it

486
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:03,829
I i'll tell you

487
00:47:03,829 --> 00:47:08,309
I'm a i'm a little irritated with this one a little irritated with this one. I don't know why this was so bad

488
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,480
I don't know why this one was considered to be so awful

489
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:15,000
Slightly irritated by this one

490
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,579
the winner

491
00:47:16,579 --> 00:47:19,219
Of the worst singing of the year

492
00:47:30,519 --> 00:47:34,360
Damedane with 18.5 percent of the vote. What was so wrong with that?

493
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:41,159
Dameo dame dameo. Well, I don't what that's what I did. What was wrong?

494
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:46,710
The raid song was in second place with 14.5 percent of the vote

495
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:53,300
And then the yoshi happy song was at 13.2 percent of the vote there

496
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:58,860
You top three the raid song was like four seconds long. I guess it means that's why it was the worst

497
00:48:01,429 --> 00:48:11,000
Just like we do the worst. We're also going to do the best. Is it too connected here? Yoshi was good

498
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:16,980
Um, well, we're in the best now. We'll find out what really was the best. I'm just gonna peek. I mean

499
00:48:17,539 --> 00:48:22,699
I peeked why does it matter if I peeked? I wrote it down

500
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:33,289
The person who wrote that I it's my handwriting. All right, uh coming up. We got the best singing. Here we go

I am here

515
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:12,090
To have some fun with you

516
00:50:13,449 --> 00:50:15,130
And me

517
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:19,210
We'll see our destiny while we're in love

518
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:27,579
It's me the comedy guy. Hey, look at that bitch. Excuse me. Where are you going? Hey, don't hold up for me

519
00:50:28,539 --> 00:50:35,079
It's me the comedy horror guy. I just make fucking jokes. Well, i'm scared. It's me the comedy guy

520
00:50:35,719 --> 00:50:38,219
I'm ruining your fucking enjoyment of my playthrough

521
00:50:39,179 --> 00:50:41,179
Shine

522
00:51:01,289 --> 00:51:09,710
Yummy banana, I can't wait to eat. Okay, where do I find a car? I just love delicious banana

523
00:51:10,429 --> 00:51:26,820
What the fuck

524
00:51:37,099 --> 00:51:40,460
Uh, so yeah, of course firework is on both best and worst singing

525
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:44,780
Because you could I guess I hit some of those notes, but the end was really bad

526
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:49,440
And there and I really sounded like kind of like a horn with no air left in it

527
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:53,780
So, I mean it could have been both

528
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,260
But you know, we'll see

529
00:51:56,340 --> 00:52:02,099
We'll see what the people have voted for the winner of best singing of the entire year goes to

530
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,820
You probably could guess it at one pious shitload

531
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:14,929
Oh my god

532
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:26,719
That's not even good

533
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:36,800
It won it won by it won 53

534
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,550
percent of the vote

535
00:52:39,550 --> 00:52:41,550
More than half of you guys voted for that

536
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,480
underneath that at

537
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:47,059
15.4 percent. So you got to go really far down

538
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:54,030
Uh was the mcdlt song and then at number three was firework at 7.6 percent of the vote

539
00:52:59,239 --> 00:53:02,510
53 percent of you voted for it. Uh, what's next?

540
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:08,530
We got a couple more to do, right? Yeah, uh, this is one of my favorite categories that has been added. This is

541
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:15,199
Uh best one guy moment and best one guy moment has turned into one of my favorite things on this stream

542
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:23,090
It's when somebody one of you is able to be to derail the entire stream and almost

543
00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:28,179
Sometimes change everything we're doing by a simple comment or something that you have said

544
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:38,139
Uh, so here are the nominees and I think there are a lot of them for the best one guy moment of the year

545
00:53:54,449 --> 00:53:59,590
Seriously, what does this have to do with anything what does this have to do with anything?

546
00:54:13,949 --> 00:54:16,030
You put the dough in the pan and put the pan in the oven

547
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:22,760
I bet you i bet your bread is real gross. We got to do a public apology

548
00:54:26,190 --> 00:54:33,380
So a lot of you may have been aware of some of the things that I may have said on stream recently

549
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:42,349
Um, I really don't mean that I didn't mean that at all and yeah, I just kind of want to go back to

550
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:45,309
Uh the kind of way it was beforehand

551
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,360
And i'm very sorry

552
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:58,699

00:55:09,099 --> 00:55:11,099
Would you eat them with a box?

556
00:55:11,179 --> 00:55:16,860
Not in a box not with a box not in a house not with a mouse. I would eat

557
00:55:17,659 --> 00:55:19,340
Music is like over each other

558
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:25,820
Is did somebody just make this account and start broadcasting in the screen cap it or fake it or is this the real account?

559
00:55:26,619 --> 00:55:27,659
That's real

Yeah, he's this is high germa in the thing but

563
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:45,280

I guarantee you're not gonna get to the first through the first part

570
00:56:13,619 --> 00:56:20,099
The fellowship of the ring with the guarantee fucking they can't be right. They can't

571
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:30,000
I saw I just saw in the chat the funniest thing i've seen all week

Smarties are great up your urethra

578
00:56:57,980 --> 00:56:59,980
Why did I read that

579
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:03,260

world of warcraft

582
00:57:07,179 --> 00:57:10,300
Hearthstone or dark souls during this stream

583
00:57:11,019 --> 00:57:12,460
If I do

584
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:16,960
I will gift five community subs per reference fury vanquished

585
00:57:24,179 --> 00:57:29,780
Five subs

586
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:34,019
There's one there's a second stream right now. It's gone and the title is high germa

587
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:38,500
You got 13.2 clicks per second. He's also cheating like you're also cheating

588
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:42,420
Like you can go download an auto clicker and have it just click

589
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:53,840
Wait, you do 13.2

590
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:59,869
I gotta be 13.2. I can't let this guy be a better streamer than me. I can't

591
00:58:05,409 --> 00:58:07,489
Somebody said why was he so out of breath?

592
00:58:08,130 --> 00:58:16,030
Is that you understand how much energy it takes to click that fast with your finger to be able to do the rapid like?

593
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:20,349
16 or like 20 it's between 16 to 25 clicks per second

594
00:58:20,670 --> 00:58:25,820
But depending on the day you use so much energy to go like this

595
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:35,170
takes a lot

596
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:41,780
okay, um

597
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:42,800
with

598
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:48,099
62 percent of the votes 62.5 percent. This is not even fair. It should have been in its own like category

599
00:58:48,659 --> 00:58:50,739
It should have just been like we should have just omitted it

600
00:58:51,380 --> 00:59:02,510
It was it's thick germa like with 62.5 percent of the vote. It spawned a lot of shit right underneath that

601
00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:07,710
You gotta well, you gotta go pretty far. You gotta go down to uh with 11.8 percent of the vote

602
00:59:08,929 --> 00:59:10,929
chuck e cheese's appearance

603
00:59:12,219 --> 00:59:14,579
um

604
00:59:14,579 --> 00:59:19,150
I mean that was that was pretty that was pretty wild chuck e cheese's appearance

605
00:59:20,179 --> 00:59:24,019
Had I mean he raided me he like hosted me and like somebody linked a picture of me kissing him

606
00:59:24,659 --> 00:59:31,059
I mean like that it was it was a wild stream. Uh, and then smarties are great up your um

607
00:59:31,619 --> 00:59:36,079
Somewhere with seven point two percent of the vote, but it was wasn't even fair

608
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:43,070
It just it seriously wasn't even fair load of the rings got robbed

609
00:59:44,809 --> 00:59:49,360
Snubs snubs all over the place not photoshopped

610
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:54,349
And it could have been uh, we're gonna do actually two more

611
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:59,199
Because I feel like these need to be back to back before we do the next match. So, uh

612
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:05,679
Oh, yeah coming up next are worst impression and best

613
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:17,679
Impression again these categories I could go like this and open it and you wouldn't even know which one it was so

614
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:25,550
We'll do worst impression first. Here comes the worst nominees for worst impressions of the year

615
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:35,139

The little guy has a mouth on him. I think

01:02:54,179 --> 01:02:57,460
They talk right can I have some of that please?

643
01:02:58,179 --> 01:03:00,179
I'll take they don't all talk like that. What?

644
01:03:02,159 --> 01:03:04,960
It's all like this. I'll take one dust, please

645
01:03:05,679 --> 01:03:07,440
I want one, too

646
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:08,960
Yeah, they do

647
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:11,440
No find somebody that can make a good cow noise

648
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:17,150
It's really hard to do that. Everybody always does that go

649
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:22,320
No, dude a cow actually goes like

650
01:03:24,639 --> 01:03:27,780
Nobody can do it

651
01:03:32,619 --> 01:03:34,619
Almost every category

652
01:03:39,489 --> 01:03:41,650
Hey rick, hey, hey morty

653
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:47,940
Turn yourself into a green screen. Oh, no

654
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:52,860
Yeah, morty you can be whatever you want in front of the green screen

655
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:57,579
I don't want to be you rick. Yeah, didn't morty get over there and be me

656
01:03:57,980 --> 01:03:59,980
No, I don't want to morty

657
01:04:01,179 --> 01:04:04,639
Tell yourself who's in that room

658
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:07,820
Ah

659
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:09,820
Probably me in that chair

660
01:04:11,170 --> 01:04:13,170
That was not good

661
01:04:15,329 --> 01:04:17,070
Was bad

662
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:23,710
That one. Hey, stop playing that. Why does it keep doing that? It wants to play one guy moments so bad over and over again

663
01:04:25,329 --> 01:04:28,289
Uh, baby bop is in almost every bad category

664
01:04:28,849 --> 01:04:33,409
Worst noise worst singing was it in best singing too? Why is baby bop in every category?

665
01:04:37,139 --> 01:04:39,139
So I have to say something about this winner

666
01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:42,269
This is just proof to me

667
01:04:42,269 --> 01:04:45,599
That I need to stop

668
01:04:45,679 --> 01:05:03,329
Doing any of the simpsons ever again for the rest of my life. I'm never doing a simpsons impression

669
01:05:04,130 --> 01:05:09,170
Uh all of the simpsons at once won by it was 30 31 percent of the vote

670
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:13,980
It's gonna be on here every single year

671
01:05:14,380 --> 01:05:19,900
It's been on here every single year if I do homer even for a second even for one goddamn second

672
01:05:21,539 --> 01:05:25,119
It's on here. If I do lisa or marge it's on here

673
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:27,280
every single year

674
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:30,030
Try homer now. No, it'll be on here

675
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:34,429
No, the best part about this stream is like a bunch of you guys forget the fucked up shit

676
01:05:34,429 --> 01:05:37,179
I'm gonna do tonight. You know what I mean?

677
01:05:37,179 --> 01:05:40,619
And it's tech wait and here's the next best part about this stream

678
01:05:41,179 --> 01:05:45,900
It ain't even january yet. So I I can do whatever I want on these award streams

679
01:05:47,699 --> 01:05:52,019
So it's the last day. You can't even nominate this. It's it's lost forever. It's lost in a void

680
01:05:53,949 --> 01:05:56,260
So, all right, here we go

681
01:05:56,260 --> 01:05:57,059
Hey

682
01:05:57,059 --> 01:05:59,070
Hey mark, it's me

683
01:05:59,070 --> 01:06:06,900
Ooh, that's what I look like when I do that. Uh, in second place was rick and morty greenscreen with 11.4 percent

684
01:06:07,889 --> 01:06:10,690
And and then a cow at 10.7 percent

685
01:06:11,090 --> 01:06:13,969
I could understand the cow one and I could understand the simpsons one

686
01:06:14,210 --> 01:06:18,500
But the rick and morty greenscreen one I thought was like kind of good. I like thought I did a good job

687
01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:27,250
Sometimes you think things that are not right. It's january here. What's wait? What time is it right now?

688
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:30,400
nine

689
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:31,840
It's nine thirty

690
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:41,309
Okay, it's nine thirty right now. I got we're dropping it on eastern time. It's six thirty my time

691
01:06:41,309 --> 01:06:47,469
But it's nine thirty eastern. We have two and a half hours. Okay, so uh, just like the bad ones

692
01:06:47,469 --> 01:06:53,230
They're also the good ones too. This is best impression of the year. Actually what?

693
01:06:57,340 --> 01:07:09,010
Okay, auto there there joe auto. He's right there. He's under he's sleeping

694
01:07:09,010 --> 01:07:15,500
I'm not gonna go wake him up. Just get him on camera. Okay. What if somebody walked into your bedroom and

695
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:20,980
Fucking just opened the cupboard and was like hey, hey come over here. What's going on?

696
01:07:21,139 --> 01:07:27,070
Come here. Come here. Look. Hey. Hey, what's up? Hey, look at the camera. What the fuck are you doing here?

697
01:07:27,469 --> 01:07:37,119
I don't want to do that like he's sleeping. He's having like a nice rest. I don't want to like go disturb him

698
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:40,900
Just rotate the camera

699
01:07:41,139 --> 01:07:45,889
He's under the blanket though. You can't see him. All right, here come the category the nominees for best impression of the year

700
01:07:46,989 --> 01:07:54,110
Uh, let's see. Let's see if your favorite got selected. See if your favorite got fucking selected

701
01:07:54,190 --> 01:08:00,829
That's the right button jeremy. Don't press the one guy one again. Here we go

702
01:08:01,869 --> 01:08:14,139
I don't want to do that. Mr. Turtle. I don't want to see that and I don't want you to come into my house

703
01:08:14,219 --> 01:08:19,199
Okay, aim on do an okay acting challenge r2 d2 dying easy

704
01:08:21,659 --> 01:08:26,130
But there's a storm

705
01:08:26,130 --> 01:08:28,430
Uh, it's not raining yet

706
01:08:29,149 --> 01:08:33,310
Uh, besides it's not actually that unsafe to swim in the storm

707
01:08:35,069 --> 01:08:36,350
everyone, uh

708
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:38,350
Keep telling me take it out of the sea

709
01:08:39,569 --> 01:08:42,050
But it's safer in here and it is up there

710
01:08:42,770 --> 01:08:44,130
uh

711
01:08:44,130 --> 01:08:46,750
Bernie, how would you like to respond to that?

712
01:08:46,909 --> 01:08:48,430
I just uh want to say

713
01:08:48,430 --> 01:08:49,630
that I think

714
01:08:49,630 --> 01:08:53,250
That answer was cringe. The following has

715
01:08:54,189 --> 01:08:59,180
Encouragement that's what it is. It's a bunch of compress the following has

716
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:02,460
encouragement

717
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:04,829
and love

718
01:09:04,829 --> 01:09:07,069
We want to thank you for being here

719
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:12,159
You're the one that gets things done around here

720
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:19,020
well, tell him a

721
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:21,560
great job

722
01:09:22,859 --> 01:09:26,779
Like I think that we can maybe get some quality entertainment here scoop

723
01:09:32,479 --> 01:09:37,439
Like maybe we should stop streaming scoop, I think maybe that's a good idea

724
01:09:52,239 --> 01:09:54,000
We are not ready

725
01:09:54,079 --> 01:09:56,079
To move forward on a stimulus

726
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,840
Not yet, maybe soon we will move forward on that but my

727
01:10:09,180 --> 01:10:14,920
Tell me everything, you know

728
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:22,039
Like a parakeet

729
01:10:22,039 --> 01:10:26,859
Yeah, it makes sense. Right? Look at half of my mannerisms just like

730
01:10:28,060 --> 01:10:30,060
Step on me step on me

731
01:10:42,649 --> 01:10:46,010
Steady diet of like captain crunching baloney. That's how you end up like that

732
01:10:47,869 --> 01:10:50,029
the winner of best impression of the year

733
01:10:51,100 --> 01:11:03,130
is

734
01:11:10,189 --> 01:11:14,350
R2 d2 dying sound with 34 percent of the vote

735
01:11:15,579 --> 01:11:17,819
Second is bernie sanders with 18 percent

736
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:23,020
And then rounding us off at the end at number three was mitch mcconnell at 12.7

737
01:11:23,659 --> 01:11:33,310
mitch mcconnell

738
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:52,279
Coming up next we have oh, no, no, no, no. No. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Well, we're done

739
01:11:52,359 --> 01:11:55,789
We're done. We're done. We're done. We're gonna do it. We're gonna do a uh match

740
01:11:57,279 --> 01:12:08,489
Political how's that political mitch mcconnell right now is like more hated than the joker is in gotham city in the fucking dc universe

741
01:12:12,489 --> 01:12:20,640
Really?

742
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:23,449
Is that politics?

743
01:12:23,449 --> 01:12:25,449
It's still political

744
01:12:25,689 --> 01:12:31,239
Yeah, whatever. It's the cbd coming out. It sure is

745
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:36,109
I promise i'm not pissing

746
01:12:36,109 --> 01:12:38,779
You probably might my noise gate probably didn't pick it up

747
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:42,500
So by the way, somebody said cbd is unregulated

748
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:46,640
Okay, and bananas have radioactive poison in them, whatever

749
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:55,710
Uh, we're gonna do the next match of the rumble and make sure I get it. I gotta hold on. Let me turn this off for a second

750
01:12:56,270 --> 01:13:00,109
Let me just let me let me see if I can make sure that I don't want I don't want the hud be gone

751
01:13:00,590 --> 01:13:10,619
I don't want to hud

752
01:13:10,619 --> 01:13:13,100
Yeah, uh, I I know I know we're gonna do the betting

753
01:13:13,579 --> 01:13:17,640
This is gonna be the second match of the evening and this one is gonna be very fun

754
01:13:18,199 --> 01:13:23,710
It might even be funny too. Let me just give the mods who it is

755
01:13:24,270 --> 01:13:32,460
So they can do the prediction. Uh, I could

756
01:13:33,180 --> 01:13:35,550
Hold on

757
01:13:38,109 --> 01:13:39,390
Uh

758
01:13:39,390 --> 01:13:41,390
Uh, wait, can you only do?

759
01:13:42,199 --> 01:13:48,109
Wait, you can only do one. This is a three-way extreme rules match. I'm not sure we can we can predict this one

760
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:56,810
Yeah, we cannot we can't do the predictions on this one. You can only do uh, two. It's only two

761
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:05,560
Yeah, it's a three-way

762
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:07,130
It will

763
01:14:07,130 --> 01:14:10,409
Oh when there are only two left. Well, whoever who have a pens wins and you know, it doesn't even matter

764
01:14:10,489 --> 01:14:12,859
I'll just I'll show it to you right now

765
01:14:12,939 --> 01:14:20,539
Ladies and gentlemen coming up next is the uh, the ritz brothers comedy routine al ritz jimmy ritz and harry ritz

766
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:41,020
Extreme rules a little sneak peek and uh, let me just make sure I can turn the hud off. What is the gorilla?

767
01:14:41,659 --> 01:14:48,729
Oh, should I turn the volume all down? Oops. That's right. I had to do that

768
01:14:49,609 --> 01:15:01,630
Introducing first in the ritz brothers comedy match. They're gonna do some uh, some slapstick for you is harry ritz. I think he's the oldest

769
01:15:05,420 --> 01:15:08,090
Also from new york

770
01:15:08,090 --> 01:15:09,930
Harry richie what?

771
01:15:09,930 --> 01:15:14,479
All right. Let me see if I can do this

772
01:15:14,479 --> 01:15:17,739
Can I can I turn off the hud?

773
01:15:17,739 --> 01:15:23,880
What? Go get him

774
01:15:30,239 --> 01:15:38,159
Here's harry ritz pointing to the ceiling thinking he's gay. I don't I think all these guys

775
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:42,960
Why does it say that in the bottom right corner? I just I think I just put it there

776
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:46,560
Yeah, these guys are from the the public domain movie night

777
01:15:47,119 --> 01:15:48,479
earlier this year

778
01:15:48,479 --> 01:15:51,359
Was that even not even been 2019?

779
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,680
They don't hey, by the way, they don't have to be from this year

780
01:15:56,109 --> 01:15:58,590
We have like two years of characters to catch up with

781
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:07,899
When you see one ritz brothers entrance, do you really need to see the other two ritz brothers entrances?

782
01:16:07,899 --> 01:16:12,000
That's what I want to ask you guys

783
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:14,399
I guess the answer is yes

784
01:16:14,399 --> 01:16:18,939
Why do you get opponents first?

785
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:23,439
From new york weighing in at 200 pounds

786
01:16:36,399 --> 01:16:38,399
All 200

787
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:42,590
Which is like a oh

788
01:16:42,590 --> 01:16:44,590
Oh my god, I can't even

789
01:16:44,750 --> 01:16:51,000
See this showing his armpits

790
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:57,390
Hey, what do you think of these ones boy?

791
01:16:57,390 --> 01:17:01,630
Uh, did they somebody ask did they remove custom arenas? No, I tried to make one but 2k 20

792
01:17:02,189 --> 01:17:04,189
is such a piece of

793
01:17:04,329 --> 01:17:06,329
steaming burning shit

794
01:17:06,590 --> 01:17:10,029
That the game would crash when I change the colors of the ropes

795
01:17:14,220 --> 01:17:17,260
It just you just can't do it. Apparently. I I can't make it through the

796
01:17:18,579 --> 01:17:23,180
Explosions coming out here

797
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:26,460
This who is this? Oh, of course. It's it's it's the youngest brother

798
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:29,479
That's jimmy ritz and

799
01:17:29,479 --> 01:17:33,449
From new york weighing in at 200 pounds

800
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:35,350
jimmy

801
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:40,329
richie

802
01:17:40,329 --> 01:17:42,329
The other entrance is so long

803
01:17:43,550 --> 01:17:52,600
So what do they get this is an extreme rules match there's no stakes here, by the way, they just wanted to come to

804
01:17:53,399 --> 01:17:56,840
Term a rumble of 2020 and show us their comedy routine

805
01:17:57,720 --> 01:17:59,720
Ritz brothers are like the three stooges

806
01:18:00,119 --> 01:18:05,000
But um sort of like the off-brand serial version of the three stooges and i'm gonna make a statement here

807
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
I think the ritz brothers are funnier

808
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,239
Than the three stooges. I think they have more comedy

809
01:18:10,039 --> 01:18:17,500
I think they have much more style

810
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:21,680
Because I mean the three stooges simply just hit each other in the head

811
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:27,600
With their fists and like poke their eyes with their fingers and stuff the ritz brothers go on detective searches. They cook food

812
01:18:28,479 --> 01:18:34,359
But hold on one second here. Can I pause it? I can't even pause it

813
01:18:35,579 --> 01:18:39,420
On stage and well put a beautiful beautiful slap to the chest

814
01:18:42,810 --> 01:18:47,850
I don't know who is who so this is the extreme rules comedy routine

815
01:18:49,039 --> 01:18:52,920
I think that was jimmy ritz

816
01:18:54,439 --> 01:18:57,600
I think that was hal al I don't even know who they are

817
01:18:59,710 --> 01:19:04,989
And jimmy ritz with a ddt onto al ritz's skull going for a pin automatically. He's not gonna get it that way

818
01:19:05,789 --> 01:19:07,789
as bob ritz

819
01:19:07,789 --> 01:19:13,390
Sticks in here going for pivot a piledriver or something powerbomb or what a reversal like jim ritz

820
01:19:15,529 --> 01:19:18,489
Is he gonna let it happen? No way, you can't just let that happen like that

821
01:19:19,449 --> 01:19:22,250
Now ritz gets grabbed by german suplex onto al ritz

822
01:19:27,819 --> 01:19:32,479
Full punch in the face from harry ritz another one

823
01:19:34,029 --> 01:19:36,029
No, a reversal by jimmy ritz

824
01:19:44,649 --> 01:19:46,170
So funny

825
01:19:46,170 --> 01:19:48,810
I love how they like bop each other in the head and stuff

826
01:19:49,789 --> 01:19:51,470
Oh, there he goes

827
01:19:51,470 --> 01:19:57,979
These guys are so god damn funny

828
01:19:58,619 --> 01:20:01,470
What's he gonna do? Oh a little slap in the face

829
01:20:06,750 --> 01:20:08,750
As jimmy ritz is outside the ring

830
01:20:09,390 --> 01:20:11,390
Currently grabbing on for dear life

831
01:20:11,710 --> 01:20:15,310
As one of the I don't know one of the other ones jimmy ritz is going into this corner here

832
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:17,310
It looks like he might have been looking for something

833
01:20:17,630 --> 01:20:21,279
Jimmy ritz is going underneath to get a comedy utensil

834
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,600
And he's got a chair

835
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:27,800
The funniest object there is and he doesn't even get to use it

836
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:31,659
He just gets punched in the face by harry ritz

837
01:20:32,380 --> 01:20:34,380
And a belly to belly suplex for his trouble

838
01:20:37,789 --> 01:20:40,029
Only one comedy utensil in the ring right now

839
01:20:41,470 --> 01:20:43,869
Jimmy ritz. Oh, no all of them go outside

840
01:20:49,079 --> 01:20:51,079
And al ritz has a sledgehammer

841
01:20:52,590 --> 01:20:56,670
Oh, and he misses completely. They don't really want to hurt each other. They're just actors

842
01:21:01,390 --> 01:21:04,909
And jimmy ritz takes an eye poke a classic comedy eye poke

843
01:21:05,710 --> 01:21:08,369
I think al ritz is I think harry ritz is bleeding

844
01:21:11,260 --> 01:21:13,260
What is that a pool cue

845
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:21,600
Do not let him pin him

846
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:26,720
There are now three comedy utensils you see he was like, ah, i'm gonna get you watch out wise guy

847
01:21:29,210 --> 01:21:32,670
Dropping him right on the tailbone

848
01:21:32,750 --> 01:21:37,069
That's gotta hurt

849
01:21:37,069 --> 01:21:40,270
Into the ropes here misses the punch great comedy duck

850
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:43,640
Oh, they they do that so well

851
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:45,880
They're so good at this

852
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:48,600
By the way, everybody needs to know this they're not actually hurting each other

853
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:54,159
They're doing just enough damage and just enough pretending to make it look good on camera

854
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,319
Although that one looked real

855
01:21:56,399 --> 01:21:58,409
So did that one

856
01:21:58,409 --> 01:22:03,850
That one this looks pretty real harry harry harry you've been going a little too hard cameras aren't even rolling anymore

857
01:22:04,409 --> 01:22:07,529
And I think that's gonna be it

858
01:22:07,529 --> 01:22:09,609
No way. Oh my goodness

859
01:22:10,989 --> 01:22:12,989
Jimmy ritz going to get another comedy utensil down here

860
01:22:13,630 --> 01:22:17,149
What do you get? He's got a baseball bat

861
01:22:19,529 --> 01:22:50,989
They're just pretending folks. It's okay. Nobody's actually injured right now

862
01:22:51,630 --> 01:22:53,630
As jimmy ritz breaks it up

863
01:22:56,539 --> 01:22:58,539
You're just masterful comedian

864
01:22:58,939 --> 01:23:03,609
Gonna bring him up to the corner here up to the top turnbuckle

865
01:23:04,329 --> 01:23:06,970
What is jimmy ritz planning to do to his brother harry ritz?

866
01:23:07,770 --> 01:23:10,930
He's got him all the way up here. He's gonna go for a suplex

867
01:23:12,109 --> 01:23:14,109
A suplex off the top rope

868
01:23:14,430 --> 01:23:17,149
Oh, and there's no way harry's gonna get up from that one

869
01:23:29,239 --> 01:23:35,960
So many reversals by jimmy ritz i'm gonna go for a forward wow beautiful flipping backwards neck breaker there

870
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:42,760
There fantastic stuff jimmy ritz going for the pin can al get in there quick enough to he completely missed

871
01:23:45,079 --> 01:23:47,640
Not the bat again, not the comedy bat

872
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:54,460
DDT by jimmy ritz onto al al is in bad shape

873
01:23:57,149 --> 01:23:59,149
He's in really bad shape right now

874
01:24:01,229 --> 01:24:04,350
As now jimmy harry seems at the most hp out of the three of them

875
01:24:05,310 --> 01:24:08,909
Big dropping suplex there gonna try to go for a pin. No bring him to the center of the ring

876
01:24:09,550 --> 01:24:11,550
Lying next to his brother

877
01:24:11,550 --> 01:24:13,840
This is a little weird

878
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:16,640
Ooh face stomp right in the front of the forward part of your face

879
01:24:20,270 --> 01:24:22,829
Nice reversal by jimmy ritz that hurt his hand. He actually hit him

880
01:24:23,979 --> 01:24:27,579
We might have to cut here. He actually punched him in the face accidentally

881
01:24:32,029 --> 01:24:34,520
Put down the sledgehammer. No, he

882
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:36,520
This looks like a finishing move

883
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:39,449
No, it's just a throw

884
01:24:39,449 --> 01:24:41,449
Just a throw and now he's taunting

885
01:24:43,180 --> 01:24:46,220
That's harry ritz, by the way, the strongest of the three brothers

886
01:24:47,319 --> 01:24:49,079
Taking it outside

887
01:24:49,079 --> 01:24:54,569
Now he gets thrown right back in

888
01:24:54,569 --> 01:24:57,770
This is al I believe and harry is now stuck in the ropes

889
01:24:58,569 --> 01:25:00,569
That may have just been a broken neck

890
01:25:01,979 --> 01:25:05,340
There's no way that this is gonna work out this way jimmy ritz is still outside. We got a one count

891
01:25:05,340 --> 01:25:07,340
We've got a two count hit no

892
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:13,439
and just like

893
01:25:13,439 --> 01:25:16,079
Every three stooges movie and every ritz brothers movie

894
01:25:17,039 --> 01:25:19,199
This is going on for way too long

895
01:25:20,439 --> 01:25:25,880
It's only so many times you can poke somebody in the eye for 97 straight minutes and jimmy ritz

896
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:30,239
Comes in with a victory

897
01:25:30,239 --> 01:25:33,039
Finishing the comedy routine for the germa rumble 2020

898
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:39,149
I love how we're watching the replay of a pin that didn't work

899
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:46,319
Not even a mention of the bat that was involved earlier

900
01:25:50,939 --> 01:25:53,229
They're all dead

901
01:25:53,229 --> 01:26:02,720
What please remember predictions?

902
01:26:03,439 --> 01:26:06,079
Well, we couldn't do predictions for this one because you can only do two

903
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:08,880
Um like one versus one

904
01:26:09,199 --> 01:26:14,890
So with a three way, it would be hard to do we'll do for the next one though. I promise. Um

905
01:26:15,369 --> 01:26:19,880
You know what the funniest part is I I thought that that was gonna be like the lamest

906
01:26:20,439 --> 01:26:25,930
Match of the evening, but that turned out to somehow be like the best one so far

907
01:26:32,670 --> 01:26:39,640
Match two is now over. We will now move on. What do they look like?

908
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:41,960
Why does it look like herman munster? I don't know

909
01:26:46,859 --> 01:26:50,380
The the bat when they just kept trading the bat back and forth and hitting each other in the face

910
01:26:51,239 --> 01:26:53,979
Oh god

911
01:26:53,979 --> 01:26:57,979
That was funny. All right moving on we got some more categories to do obviously

912
01:27:00,439 --> 01:27:04,119
Uh, we actually you know what we'll take a break after this next run of categories

913
01:27:04,119 --> 01:27:08,779
How does that sound let's turn that volume mixer down and we come back to this

914
01:27:09,550 --> 01:27:20,600
Uh, the next one we'll take a break after this. Yeah, welcome back to the awards section of this stream

915
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:27,260
Like maybe should I get some light on me? I got jump scared. Oh, i'm sorry

916
01:27:28,380 --> 01:27:31,979
Uh best joke taking more than five minutes to set up and you're probably wondering

917
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:35,260
What happened to worst joke taking more than five minutes to set up?

918
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:40,039
Well, there really wasn't very many or they were so bad that they could not even be nominated

919
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:49,560
So we only have a best of this year for 2020 it just like burped so loud inside of my body

920
01:27:50,380 --> 01:27:56,029
If there was a microphone inside of my esophagus down here, you guys would have freaked out. It was really loud in here

921
01:27:56,270 --> 01:28:02,779
I could hear that internally. What is up?

922
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:09,979
gas

923
01:28:09,979 --> 01:28:13,739
Well, I didn't no no, I didn't do the nominations yet. Uh, oh cbd's kicking in

924
01:28:14,479 --> 01:28:18,720
Uh, all right. So best joke taking them with a five minute setup. What this means is uh, I kind of

925
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:25,359
Just take a few minutes to do something and I set it up and I try to make people laugh and

926
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:30,810
Let's say four to ten times it works out the other six I get ridiculed off the stream

927
01:28:32,199 --> 01:28:35,479
But here we go now here are the nominees for best joke taking more than five minutes to set up

928
01:28:37,369 --> 01:28:40,960
What's in the cup? It's just a little it's just a little cbd thc

Sippy, you know nothing major just something to have fun and relax. All right, here come the nominees for

Uh best joke taking for the five minute. Okay, it's it's hitting me

01:29:02,590 --> 01:29:06,590
Oh, there was an estimate that there was going to be a speedy stimulus package and it didn't happen

932
01:29:09,449 --> 01:29:14,840
Oh shit, all the investors were expecting it. It didn't happen ceo tweeted out

933
01:29:15,630 --> 01:29:22,569
picture of asshole with two middle fingers on it and said fuck all investors

934
01:29:24,010 --> 01:29:27,289
Oh, that holy shit. That's the only way this would have happened

935
01:29:27,930 --> 01:29:37,199
Hello. Hey, what's up? It's me. Oh, hey, what's going on? How are you doing?

Say it say the line. You came just in time

Dastardly t-shirts the way they do that old baby. Will you stand the smelly smells for 10 minutes?

942
01:30:11,979 --> 01:30:13,979
Or will you puke into the toilet?

943
01:30:20,380 --> 01:30:22,380
Yeah

944
01:30:36,489 --> 01:30:38,489

948
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:56,000
paternity test

949
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000

Holy shit jerry

957
01:31:35,930 --> 01:31:43,100
It was started as a small confrontation has turned into an absolute bloodbath brawl outside of the 7-eleven

958
01:31:43,420 --> 01:31:45,420
It looks like they're upset that

959
01:31:46,699 --> 01:31:48,699
mcdonald's

960
01:31:49,680 --> 01:31:51,899
They have something

961
01:31:51,899 --> 01:31:54,300
Roger i'm not even entirely sure what they got these weapons

962
01:31:55,739 --> 01:31:58,460
The battle for the battle for home depot

963
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:04,840
Roger people are people on social media are calling this the battle of home depot

964
01:32:09,079 --> 01:32:14,199
Mom, i'm really my mother's probably watching the stream going. What the fuck is this kid doing? I didn't raise him like this

965
01:32:15,319 --> 01:32:19,659
Hey, um

01:32:19,659 --> 01:32:21,899
Yeah, i'm all right. I just had some work done

967
01:32:24,119 --> 01:32:26,920
This is what a toddler does when they know they did something wrong

968
01:32:29,300 --> 01:32:32,340
That should be an emote stanley kubrick

969
01:32:35,329 --> 01:32:38,340

971
01:32:45,329 --> 01:32:48,979
If I take a bite of this will you get over it?

972
01:33:05,039 --> 01:33:11,279
Fucking sans

973
01:33:11,279 --> 01:33:16,510
It should never have been in the game. It's not a nintendo character

974
01:33:17,149 --> 01:33:25,569
Right behind you right behind him shit. I fell down

975
01:33:26,210 --> 01:33:32,029

976
01:33:32,770 --> 01:33:37,170

977
01:33:37,170 --> 01:33:39,170
Hey, where do you guys know where I am?

978
01:33:39,649 --> 01:33:43,170
I don't know where I am. I'm in the water need help to me to me to me to me

979
01:33:44,050 --> 01:33:46,050

980
01:33:46,369 --> 01:33:48,369
Fucking idiots. I have two

981
01:33:49,880 --> 01:33:51,720
Come on. We're on our way

982
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:55,939
And i'm gonna die like i'm gonna die here and that's fine. I'll fucking take it up with the guild leader later

983
01:33:56,260 --> 01:33:58,899
This is like this is the type of shit. This is why we can't get the fucking top 100

984
01:34:07,909 --> 01:34:10,470
Well, uh, so

985
01:34:10,890 --> 01:34:14,010
This one is the I believe the closest one of the of the entire evening

986
01:34:14,789 --> 01:34:16,789
Uh, this one was by a margin

987
01:34:17,479 --> 01:34:19,609
of

988
01:34:19,609 --> 01:34:21,770
Like seven tenths of a percentage

989
01:34:23,020 --> 01:34:26,300
So the two top ones are both 20

990
01:34:26,779 --> 01:34:32,630
Percent and then something just to let you know, this is the closest one of the auto. Yes auto has awakened

991
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:43,350
Uh, I'm having fun

992
01:34:44,220 --> 01:34:51,369
You having fun over there? He's just like rubbing his back like a bear on a tree and he's just sneezing

993
01:34:52,029 --> 01:34:54,270
What are you doing over there?

994
01:34:54,270 --> 01:34:56,489
Also, who do you think's gonna win?

995
01:34:56,489 --> 01:35:03,069
Who do you think what do you think's gonna win best joke taking more than five minutes to set up cookies?

996
01:35:04,079 --> 01:35:08,239
Uh, well, that's not that's not on the that's not a category auto. That's not a nominee

997
01:35:13,770 --> 01:35:18,729
The winner of best joke of the year taking more than five was just pretty much best joke of the year

998
01:35:18,810 --> 01:35:27,239
Let's just go for it. Ladies and gentlemen the winner with 20.86 percent of the vote

999
01:35:31,039 --> 01:35:33,340
jigsaw house with

1000
01:35:34,420 --> 01:35:36,979
20.08 percent of the vote

1001
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:41,670
Eating the shoe lost

1002
01:35:41,989 --> 01:35:48,439
Very close very close in third place was ah eu which I know that it's supposed to be five minutes

1003
01:35:48,439 --> 01:35:57,130
But I think that bit went on for like 30. So it was allowed just chillin

1004
01:35:57,130 --> 01:36:06,970
Uh, yeah jigsaw house 20 well 15.7 percent for ah eu by the way recency bias recency bias

1009
01:36:33,119 --> 01:36:38,159
This is the two of the night that I think are going to be the most irritating to sit through

1010
01:36:39,109 --> 01:36:39,989
For a lot of you guys

1011
01:36:39,989 --> 01:36:42,390
So I just want to give you warning now some of you guys that might be new here

1012
01:36:42,470 --> 01:36:45,109
You might leave the stream in about two minutes

1013
01:36:45,939 --> 01:36:50,819
Uh, the next categories are going to be worst noise of the year and best noise of the year

1014
01:36:51,060 --> 01:36:53,060
And there were a shitload of nominees

1015
01:36:54,369 --> 01:36:57,329
The I there's like 20 nominees in worst noise

1016
01:36:58,869 --> 01:37:04,100
So strap yourself in and get ready to hear some of the things you don't ever want to hear ever again

Year, you didn't even see me. I didn't

1020
01:37:32,289 --> 01:37:36,760
Okay, somebody squeezed a little too much air out of me

1021
01:37:38,149 --> 01:37:47,000
All right, this is cool. I'm gonna sneeze but I cannot mute my microphone

1022
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:50,119

Funny man make a funny noise funny man make a funny noise. All right fine

1024
01:38:01,750 --> 01:38:06,229
I don't think I could hit a bong man. I really don't think I could in real life. I would probably fucking fall down

1025
01:38:09,140 --> 01:38:11,140
I would hit the bong. It'd be like

1026
01:38:22,640 --> 01:38:24,640
Also nominated for worst face

1027
01:38:29,939 --> 01:38:35,460
What are these um, well these like little like white things in the ground dude

1028
01:38:36,920 --> 01:38:38,920

What I didn't get that guy give us a joke you got it

1030
01:39:00,979 --> 01:39:09,220

1031
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:30,800
I think it's hitting him now. I got it

1032
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:35,359
Cover it with cheese. The ooey gooey cheesy

1033
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:39,760
Oh, yeah. Oh my god. Does it have like a bunch of fucking nacho cheese on it? Oh,

1034
01:39:41,439 --> 01:39:43,439
I know I get it, but it's still good

1035
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:50,199
Oh, how can we make a how can we make like a caesar salad better?

1036
01:39:51,890 --> 01:39:54,850
Cover it with ooey gooey yummy cheesy cheesy

1037
01:39:54,850 --> 01:39:56,760
Cheesy

1038
01:39:56,760 --> 01:40:05,239
Germa is just a scary motherfucker. No, but I am I though I completely disagree

1039
01:40:07,640 --> 01:40:13,670
I disagree lick whale lord. Oh dude, that wouldn't be so gross

1040
01:40:29,510 --> 01:40:40,050
Where's he

1041
01:40:45,039 --> 01:40:47,479
Good

1042
01:40:47,479 --> 01:41:03,350
Oh, come on

1043
01:41:03,829 --> 01:41:06,149
No, excuse me. That was not a donkey sound

1044
01:41:07,189 --> 01:41:09,189
This is a donkey sound

1045
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:18,760
Oh, that's one of those ducks at the store that you squeeze the dog toy never mind I tried

1046
01:41:20,439 --> 01:41:22,439
So many nominees

1047
01:41:24,119 --> 01:41:28,289
So many nominees for this category

1048
01:41:29,619 --> 01:41:36,770
But they can only be one winner, uh, they can only be three that are even listed so the winner of

1049
01:41:37,810 --> 01:41:40,529
The best noise of the year. No, no, no shit. That's wrong

1050
01:41:40,529 --> 01:41:44,689
It's worst noise of the year the winner of worst noise of the year is going to be

1051
01:41:50,369 --> 01:41:54,289
With 11.66 percent of the vote. We have ooey gooey

1052
01:41:55,619 --> 01:41:58,180
ooey gooey one with eleven point six

1053
01:41:58,979 --> 01:42:08,289
Six percent. Um, I think I you know, it's not even a noise. I just talked I just said a sentence

1054
01:42:08,689 --> 01:42:15,399
Um, I think it's just everybody hated the sentence therefore nominated it so often everybody voted for it. Um,

1055
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:21,560
So after that very very close though with eleven point one six percent of the vote

1056
01:42:21,560 --> 01:42:25,880
So another very very close one even closer than the last one was the horrendous pig

1057
01:42:29,359 --> 01:42:31,539
So if you want to be a purist here

1058
01:42:31,539 --> 01:42:35,300
You could say that the horrendous pig was the worst noise of the year

1059
01:42:36,199 --> 01:42:45,029
And ooey gooey was the most hated phrase of the year after that at nine point. Oh five percent is chubaka transforming

1060
01:42:46,630 --> 01:42:55,829
I could see that I could see that. Yeah, I could see that acceptable. Yeah, that's that's an acceptable win

1061
01:42:56,550 --> 01:42:59,039
There are your winners. Uh

1062
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:05,119
What's the next one right here? So just like worst noise we have best noise now best noise

1063
01:43:05,970 --> 01:43:09,329
Um doesn't no doesn't include anything like singing or anything. Uh, this is just what people

1064
01:43:10,529 --> 01:43:13,970
Thought was a better sound. I thought it was cooler thought it was funnier

1065
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,569
the only thing I can't believe about this one is

1066
01:43:19,199 --> 01:43:21,199
There's a there's a nominee on here that is so

1067
01:43:21,859 --> 01:43:28,039
Ear screechingly horrible that I cannot comprehend why it is not in the other category

1068
01:43:30,260 --> 01:43:33,220
So just be aware. There is like ear scraping

1069
01:43:33,460 --> 01:43:42,930
There's like ear like a like a q-tip going in there and just like it's i'm just warning it now. Here we go

1070
01:43:43,569 --> 01:44:00,020
Nominees for best noise of the year wanted to warn you where's best noise

1071
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:04,880
best noise of the year

1072
01:44:15,640 --> 01:44:21,970
You're never gonna get painfully clean like this

1073
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:48,840
What's over there

1074
01:44:51,800 --> 01:44:54,680
And stop no whammies nobody tell her

1075
01:44:55,560 --> 01:45:02,619
Him i'm telling you what i'll hold that shit for me take a look at this scrumptious

1076
01:45:03,640 --> 01:45:05,640
cheese

1077
01:45:16,279 --> 01:45:18,640
Pizza

1078
01:45:25,279 --> 01:45:26,800
Neck thickness

1079
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:28,479
Oh god

1080
01:45:28,479 --> 01:45:33,039
It's like I swallow. I like cartoon python swallowed a plate or something

1081
01:45:35,800 --> 01:45:37,800
My character right now is going like

1082
01:45:39,319 --> 01:45:41,319
And I want you to listen to that crunch

1083
01:45:48,199 --> 01:45:56,050
You were wrong you were wrong

1084
01:46:09,090 --> 01:46:24,359
Okay

1085
01:46:24,359 --> 01:46:27,760
The winner of the best noise of the year, I think

1086
01:46:28,720 --> 01:46:30,720
Won this like a year or two ago

1087
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:35,670
I can't do this anymore either because when I do this people just vote for it people just nominate and people just go

1088
01:46:35,670 --> 01:46:37,119
Yeah, that's the one

1089
01:46:37,119 --> 01:46:39,039
Uh, the winner is

1090
01:46:39,039 --> 01:46:48,180
Well, I gotta play the fanfare

1091
01:46:48,180 --> 01:46:54,789
Didgeridoo at twenty point three six percent of the vote. So more than twenty percent of the vote didgeridoo won

1092
01:46:55,670 --> 01:46:59,909
Uh, and then doy doy which got fourteen point five percent of the vote

1093
01:47:00,470 --> 01:47:03,989
Which confuses me because the first time I ever did the doy doy thing

1094
01:47:04,789 --> 01:47:09,029
People screamed at me. They said stop that hurts my ears. I hate it never do that again

1095
01:47:09,350 --> 01:47:13,720
Don't ever do the doy doy doy thing ever again. And then two years later

1096
01:47:14,119 --> 01:47:16,119
I do the doy doy doy thing again

1097
01:47:16,279 --> 01:47:22,159
And all of a sudden now it's just second place for best noise of the year. What happened your tastes change

1098
01:47:22,479 --> 01:47:26,310
I'm gonna do it right now

1099
01:47:39,350 --> 01:47:47,590
There you go, oh and my ears won uh with eleven point five percent in third place i'm leaving don't leave please

1100
01:47:48,550 --> 01:47:50,680
uh

1101
01:47:50,680 --> 01:47:54,279
Eleven point five percent for my ears, which is the one that would hurt. That's the one that hurt

1102
01:47:55,989 --> 01:47:58,149
I think um, does that catch us up weird for another match?

1103
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:05,350
After we take a break, let's see how caught up we was that was that four? I believe that was four

1104
01:48:05,829 --> 01:48:13,510
We had one one two three four one two three four one two three. Yes, we did. Okay. All right, let's take a quick break

1105
01:48:13,750 --> 01:48:19,460
I'll be right back. I'm gonna just get another maybe another drink maybe

1106
01:48:20,359 --> 01:48:24,119
Uh, see if auto needs to get anything see if auto needs to go out and i'll be right back. See you guys in a minute

1107
01:48:24,279 --> 01:51:49,649
Hey, hello

1108
01:51:49,649 --> 01:51:53,409
Hi everybody. I have returned to set up the next match in the rumble

1109
01:51:53,970 --> 01:51:59,939
So the next match is going to be a four-way

1110
01:52:00,739 --> 01:52:07,890
Uh tables, I believe tables ladders and chairs match be sus. Oh god

1111
01:52:10,869 --> 01:52:13,109
There always has to be a tables ladders and chairs match

1112
01:52:15,720 --> 01:52:19,560
Hear the crowd

1113
01:52:19,560 --> 01:52:21,560
Let me make sure the next one is set up

1114
01:52:25,140 --> 01:52:31,920
Yeah, here it comes

1115
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:34,399
Uh, hold on a sec. Let me get that over here. Okay

1116
01:52:35,199 --> 01:52:39,359
Where is this? I need to move this

1117
01:52:44,369 --> 01:52:46,689
This light is oh shit, okay, I don't want to break anything

1118
01:52:47,699 --> 01:52:49,699
All right. So again, this is a tlc match

1119
01:52:50,710 --> 01:52:54,529
god

1120
01:52:54,529 --> 01:52:56,529
Tlc and it is between

1121
01:52:57,329 --> 01:53:03,720
a lot of different fandoms a lot of different fandoms here if you could think of a

1122
01:53:04,920 --> 01:53:07,079
certain group of people

1123
01:53:07,079 --> 01:53:09,640
that love a certain

1124
01:53:09,960 --> 01:53:12,279
franchise or certain characters you'd put them into a

1125
01:53:13,460 --> 01:53:23,279
Into a crew wouldn't you and we've had quite a few crews over the years, especially considering the last couple of years

1126
01:53:26,079 --> 01:53:34,850
The next match is going to be a four-way between those crews. So let me uh, let's go

1127
01:53:38,979 --> 01:53:41,300
Welcome back to the rumble portion of the stream

1128
01:53:49,439 --> 01:53:51,439
First character being introduced

1129
01:53:52,079 --> 01:53:54,520
Is murius

1130
01:53:54,520 --> 01:53:57,140
Of the moo crew

1131
01:53:57,779 --> 01:53:59,779
Also was nominated for best character of the year

1132
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:07,960
Ooh 220

1133
01:54:07,960 --> 01:54:12,199
That's not the name of that animal is not mega milk. It is murius

1134
01:54:14,449 --> 01:54:19,699
representing the moo crew

1135
01:54:19,720 --> 01:54:21,720
Ladder back there. Whoa

1136
01:54:22,659 --> 01:54:25,619
Somebody in the audience. He must have he must have that gray

1137
01:54:26,260 --> 01:54:27,779
Leash attached to him

1138
01:54:27,779 --> 01:54:40,319
I know how he gets when that's on him the anger leash our next competitor

1139
01:54:40,960 --> 01:54:45,000
Coming in here to challenge the moo crew and the other two

1140
01:54:48,050 --> 01:54:51,010
Are the wink dinks germa wink?

1141
01:55:02,739 --> 01:55:05,279
superstar, okay

1142
01:55:05,279 --> 01:55:10,880
So yeah, 75 000 channel points a lot of you got really into that. So obviously germa wink wanted to come and represent himself

1143
01:55:11,680 --> 01:55:16,800
To represent the wink dinks

1144
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:18,800
Can you guess where this guy's from?

1145
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:27,250
Coming up next

1146
01:55:27,250 --> 01:55:29,250
I wonder

1147
01:55:32,640 --> 01:55:35,199
I got you know, i'm gonna put my money on the dinks tonight

1148
01:55:35,439 --> 01:55:37,279
I think they have a lot riding here

1149
01:55:37,279 --> 01:55:40,319
They've been waiting for winks to come back for like a year and a half and they're just not coming back

1150
01:55:41,039 --> 01:55:45,039
Most dedicated fan base I think is but wait a minute. I'll be talking about dedicated fan bases

1151
01:55:45,600 --> 01:55:48,720
We're having a talk about dedicated fan bases. I think that's nancy dru

1152
01:55:50,500 --> 01:55:52,500
That's nancy dru

1153
01:55:55,920 --> 01:55:59,729
Representing the true crew

1154
01:55:59,729 --> 01:56:01,010
Nancy dru

1155
01:56:01,010 --> 01:56:09,270
With her atv looking to find a new part of a new clue for an old egyptian temple

1156
01:56:10,789 --> 01:56:12,789
Stumbled her way in here. She she knew

1157
01:56:13,430 --> 01:56:16,640
And she needed to be represented

1158
01:56:16,640 --> 01:56:30,920
But that's not all there's still one more group one more incredibly incredibly important group in this

1159
01:56:31,640 --> 01:56:33,939
channel in this universe here

1160
01:56:33,939 --> 01:56:38,180
You know, I talk about it all the time. I say it all the time. I address you guys as such

1161
01:56:47,510 --> 01:56:49,680
Still on nancy dru though

1162
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:52,420
It's the banana brothers. Oh

1163
01:56:52,739 --> 01:56:54,739
And nobody seems to like the banana bros

1164
01:56:55,380 --> 01:57:01,640
this is

1165
01:57:01,640 --> 01:57:05,880
Everybody hates the banana bros. I why they boo with the banana bros

1166
01:57:11,640 --> 01:57:17,720
Somebody wrote oh my god, fuck this guy. All right, can I skip this? Can I skip this shit?

1167
01:57:25,170 --> 01:57:27,170
Everybody hates him

1168
01:57:27,569 --> 01:57:29,569
I love this guy

1169
01:57:29,890 --> 01:57:33,859
I love the banana bros

1170
01:57:38,340 --> 01:57:41,640
Murius the wink dinks moo crew wink dinks true crew

1171
01:57:42,199 --> 01:57:48,039
Versus banana bros fatal four way tables ladders and chairs match

1172
01:57:48,920 --> 01:57:51,319
Nancy dru is not wasting a single second of her time

1173
01:57:53,880 --> 01:57:57,800
Throwing murius into the ropes over the ropes now. There are I don't there are no rules here

1174
01:57:59,460 --> 01:58:01,890
zero rules

1175
01:58:01,890 --> 01:58:05,010
It's just whoever loses. Where wait, where are all the items?

1176
01:58:07,279 --> 01:58:08,720
Where are the items?

1177
01:58:08,720 --> 01:58:13,829
It's supposed to be tables ladders and chairs. I don't see a single table. I don't see a single

1178
01:58:14,390 --> 01:58:16,390
Ladder I don't see a single chair

1179
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:23,250
You forgot to put them out

1180
01:58:23,329 --> 01:58:26,020
What are you serious?

1181
01:58:29,319 --> 01:58:32,279
Oh the banana the banana is getting absolutely bruised right now

1182
01:58:34,770 --> 01:58:36,130
Am I blind?

1183
01:58:36,130 --> 01:58:45,140
What do you mean? It's under the ring. Where are they going? No. No, I see up top up top up top

1184
01:58:49,479 --> 01:58:55,239
Holy shit. That was a big right hand overhead smash from murius out of nancy dru. By the way, whoever wins this

1185
01:58:56,930 --> 01:59:01,329
This is what I will call this channel's community for the next six months

1186
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:03,840
so

1187
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:05,840
Uh, there's a lot riding on this one

1188
01:59:13,239 --> 01:59:17,960
Big punching match here in the middle of the ring murius seems to have missed that double

1189
01:59:18,840 --> 01:59:20,840
twisted kick up

1190
01:59:21,399 --> 01:59:22,840
Boozled

1191
01:59:22,840 --> 01:59:23,880
What?

1192
01:59:23,880 --> 01:59:25,880
I kick a paloozle

1193
01:59:29,319 --> 01:59:35,039
Somebody get a table in here. Oh finally the banana bro is always taking the initiative

1194
01:59:35,840 --> 01:59:38,079
Reaching under the ring getting the first ladder of the evening

1195
01:59:40,899 --> 01:59:44,020
Yeah, one of the most dedicated one of the most passionate

1196
01:59:45,060 --> 01:59:47,060
fandoms on this channel the banana bros

1197
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:53,840
He's gonna know he's not gonna be able to have any time the ladder was stolen by the winktinks

1198
01:59:56,949 --> 01:59:59,430
Winktink just wants to get up there. I don't think he was supposed

1199
02:00:00,149 --> 02:00:02,149
No, they're just setting it up ready to go

1200
02:00:03,319 --> 02:00:07,319
Nancy dru and murius have been outside this whole time just punching each other in the face

1201
02:00:08,050 --> 02:00:12,239
Oh, and she heard me. That was a huge kick from nancy dru

1202
02:00:14,130 --> 02:00:25,359
Leave oh ddt onto the ladder might see another uh might see a ladder set up here. Nope

1203
02:00:25,840 --> 02:00:28,069
Oh

1204
02:00:28,069 --> 02:00:31,829
Of all the things you could have done banana bro, that was probably the worst one to do

1205
02:00:33,029 --> 02:00:37,640
Murius setting up the ladder though murius thinking about get no murius is getting something else

1206
02:00:39,640 --> 02:00:41,239
Murius is going to get

1207
02:00:41,239 --> 02:00:45,159
One of the chairs over here. He went a long way to get that single chair

1208
02:00:45,479 --> 02:00:48,359
I hope it was worth it

1209
02:00:48,359 --> 02:00:53,720
Just like in black and white the ai is so bad with their pathing but he gets the hit he gets two hits

1210
02:00:55,090 --> 02:00:56,130
and

1211
02:00:56,130 --> 02:01:00,449
Nancy dru was just concerned about what was currently happening and murius

1212
02:01:01,409 --> 02:01:03,489
Fleeting up right now the new crew

1213
02:01:06,949 --> 02:01:14,520
Big elbow drop nancy dru was just trying to stop. She was looking at her dialogue options

1214
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:22,390
One of them was please don't hit him. The other one was how much did that cost and the other one was

1215
02:01:22,949 --> 02:01:25,750
Where can I find the bar?

1216
02:01:25,750 --> 02:01:29,939
Murius is getting up to the top. No nancy dru throws him down

1217
02:01:30,739 --> 02:01:38,560
Kicking him right into his sternum both going outside again. There's an opportunity here for banana bros

1218
02:01:39,729 --> 02:01:43,409
Doesn't look like they're going to capitalize though nancy dru with a swinging neck breaker

1219
02:01:46,819 --> 02:01:48,920
But wink dink from behind nancy dru

1220
02:01:50,819 --> 02:01:53,439
Shit

1221
02:01:53,439 --> 02:01:58,880
And the wink dink he's he's signaling his crowd to do everybody to wink in the crowd banana bro. What are you doing?

1222
02:02:03,859 --> 02:02:09,300
He wanted attention. They're all just craving your attention. They're all just trying to get attention

1223
02:02:10,739 --> 02:02:12,739
They so badly want you to look at them

1224
02:02:14,260 --> 02:02:19,060
Moo crew moo crew banana bros. Oh this way banana bros banana bros out

1225
02:02:23,600 --> 02:02:27,279
Ladder set up again murius going in for a swinging ddt tornado style

1226
02:02:31,039 --> 02:02:34,800
Moo crew signaling his fans now to spam the chat room

1227
02:02:37,720 --> 02:02:41,479
Big right hand onto nancy dru swinging her around dropping down

1228
02:02:42,279 --> 02:02:44,279
And this opportunity is being taken by the wink dinks

1229
02:02:44,680 --> 02:02:46,680
Wink dinks are going up but murius

1230
02:02:46,680 --> 02:02:49,170
He's almost gonna get is he gonna get it

1231
02:02:49,329 --> 02:02:54,369
Murius going for the punch in the stomach is the wink dinks gonna win can the wink dinks possibly secure this

1232
02:02:55,329 --> 02:02:58,689
Three punches four punches in the stomach and here comes the banana bro

1233
02:02:59,409 --> 02:03:01,890
No, he's trying to push it down

1234
02:03:02,609 --> 02:03:06,470
Why is nobody trying to grab? He can't even push it down. He's not strong enough

1235
02:03:13,140 --> 02:03:16,020
What did he take it why did he take it

1236
02:03:19,800 --> 02:03:21,800
They're just running into each other

1237
02:03:23,489 --> 02:03:25,489
Big belly to back suplex by murius

1238
02:03:26,529 --> 02:03:31,010
Signaling the moo crew. He's ready. He's ready to have you guys be called that for the next six months

1239
02:03:33,270 --> 02:03:35,270
Nancy dru has finally gotten up

1240
02:03:35,750 --> 02:03:37,729
Finally getting back into the ring

1241
02:03:37,729 --> 02:03:41,489
It seems like ages ago that she was in this and she's gonna take the opportunity to go up nancy dru with the dru crew

1242
02:03:41,569 --> 02:03:44,130
Going up to the top rope going on top. She's got the briefcase

1243
02:03:45,479 --> 02:03:47,560
Is nancy dru gonna pull this off in the in the?

1244
02:03:50,659 --> 02:03:55,619
In the the absolute calamity going on nancy dru might have actually just gotten this

1245
02:03:56,420 --> 02:03:59,859
She can't do the mini game. Oh, she was always so bad at this one

1246
02:04:05,520 --> 02:04:08,880
Grabbing his arm wink dinks is throwing down murius

1247
02:04:11,159 --> 02:04:14,069
caught in the ropes

1248
02:04:14,069 --> 02:04:17,109
Wink dink is very strong right now murius has the most health

1249
02:04:18,260 --> 02:04:19,779
but uh-oh

1250
02:04:19,779 --> 02:04:23,779

02:04:27,460 --> 02:04:29,170
You almost got it

1253
02:04:29,170 --> 02:04:34,050
Push it over push it over. I don't want to call everybody wink dinks for the next six months. Don't push it over

1254
02:04:34,529 --> 02:04:36,420
Somebody get up there, please

1255
02:04:36,420 --> 02:04:38,550
Murius, please

1256
02:04:38,550 --> 02:04:44,420
Somebody stop it nancy dru run your atv into here and run it over. How is he still got this?

1257
02:04:45,430 --> 02:04:50,840
Banana bro's just like yeah, I don't understand this is fucked up big powerbomb

1258
02:04:59,920 --> 02:05:05,159
Why is she on the top rope wait, why is she sitting on the top rope banana bro got the ladder

1259
02:05:05,880 --> 02:05:11,079
Setting it up. Is this the banana bro's victory lap right now looks at nancy dru does not

1260
02:05:11,720 --> 02:05:15,560
Does not attack her she's on the top ropes. Is she gonna go for no?

1261
02:05:16,119 --> 02:05:20,210
That was the worst thing you could have done nancy dru. Oh catches him

1262
02:05:21,010 --> 02:05:28,529
Oh the skill the the app the just the necessity of that moment

1263
02:05:30,340 --> 02:05:32,199
She investigated

1264
02:05:32,199 --> 02:05:33,880
She took a look at her clues

1265
02:05:33,880 --> 02:05:37,239
And she found out that that was probably the best idea and maybe it's going to be a good enough idea to win this match

1266
02:05:37,239 --> 02:05:42,039
And be called the dru crew for the next six months nancy dru ladies and gentlemen has unlatched it

1267
02:05:44,659 --> 02:05:47,539
The dru crew prevails once again as they always do

Dru crew has prevailed nancy dru with the win

1269
02:05:59,010 --> 02:06:00,789

That's what you guys are gonna be called now. You're the dru crew now for at least six months

1272
02:06:15,489 --> 02:06:22,340
That was a huge clutch the big jumping two-handed two foot stomp kicking off the top rope

1273
02:06:22,659 --> 02:06:30,739
That's a deserved win for nancy dru banana bros. You had a chance, but you really blew it

1274
02:06:36,689 --> 02:06:39,760
All right, let's keep going

Uh, a very very I like this category a lot. I feel like this happens all the time

1279
02:07:08,079 --> 02:07:11,359
So there's a lot to choose from it is a best scare moment

1280
02:07:12,520 --> 02:07:19,510
Best time that I was ever scared on stream whether a jump scare or uh, or likewise. Is he high?

1281
02:07:22,770 --> 02:07:30,000
Probably a little probably it's new easy. Whatever. What do I what do you want? Just maybe this is a little maybe just a

1282
02:07:30,479 --> 02:07:44,369
Little bit. It's a small amount. He's fucking zonked. No, i'm not the wink things did all the work

1283
02:07:44,609 --> 02:07:51,220
Yeah, the wink things did all the work and then nancy dru, uh, just kind of nancy dru and the banner bros really just capitalized

the winner of best scare moment of the year

1312
02:11:18,359 --> 02:11:20,199
is

1313
02:11:20,199 --> 02:11:25,939
Peeking down the hallway at 17 percent of the vote in five nights at freddys. I was lied to

1314
02:11:26,739 --> 02:11:29,619
Uh, I was told that that's not supposed to happen

1315
02:11:29,619 --> 02:11:33,699
I was told that that was just of like a 0.2 chance and I was told to do it again

1316
02:11:34,100 --> 02:11:37,380
And it happened again, and then I realized I was very angry with you

1317
02:11:37,939 --> 02:11:40,180
Uh, so yeah, then you got me twice

1318
02:11:41,270 --> 02:11:43,270
Uh, that was 17 percent. They were all still pretty close

1319
02:11:44,279 --> 02:11:49,510
No air left was 12.82 percent, which i'll be honest with you

1320
02:11:49,510 --> 02:11:53,670
That was probably that was probably the for me at least if I if I if this was no

1321
02:11:54,229 --> 02:11:59,029
Voting allowed here. Uh, that would be the worst one for me. I remember that very vividly

1322
02:11:59,029 --> 02:12:05,350
It was fucking horrible and then bunny in the room at 12.5 percent that one got pretty high because I mean I was like

1323
02:12:05,750 --> 02:12:10,770
Drinking right I had been drinking and it was just so easy just to get the shit out of me

1324
02:12:10,770 --> 02:12:21,409
So that I could understand I was pretty jumpy. So yeah, that's uh peeking down the hallway wins the best scare moment drunk

1325
02:12:21,409 --> 02:12:26,470
Yeah, I was I was yeah, I was he took the headset off. He was so scared

1326
02:12:30,229 --> 02:12:34,640
Okay, let's uh, what do we got we have i'm gonna make sure there's enough left to do the end too

1327
02:12:35,350 --> 02:12:38,710
Oh, yeah, there is let me get the all right. Let's get this one out of the way now

1328
02:12:40,239 --> 02:12:47,060
Because uh, I want the top categories to be the last thing that we do before the rumble or after the rumble

1329
02:12:47,220 --> 02:12:54,199
Okay, so the next one this is best accident. I I tend to have lots of accidents on stream

1330
02:12:54,920 --> 02:12:58,199
Uh, whether that's falling down somewhere irl whether that's

1331
02:12:59,350 --> 02:13:04,369
Messing up something uh saying something. I shouldn't say this is a new category. Uh,

1332
02:13:05,600 --> 02:13:10,800
I make mistakes all the time. I'm only human. I make mistakes and I have to live with them

1333
02:13:10,880 --> 02:13:15,170
Okay, so here are the nominees for the best accidents of the year

1334
02:13:47,300 --> 02:13:50,340
This is not the way i'm going out this is not the way i'm going out on

1335
02:13:51,539 --> 02:13:53,220
All right, long story short

1336
02:13:53,220 --> 02:13:58,260
I can bring the switch to the bathroom and I can shit on it and keep and keep my hands close

1337
02:13:58,739 --> 02:14:04,020
And not have to worry about my legs tingling so I can get up whenever I want and put it over

1338
02:14:04,260 --> 02:14:06,260
Okay, my nieces and nephews

1339
02:14:06,899 --> 02:14:09,539
Love lego star wars. It's like their favorite thing in the world

1340
02:14:10,180 --> 02:14:12,529
And I got a text

1341
02:14:12,529 --> 02:14:14,659

1342
02:14:14,659 --> 02:14:16,659
and from my sister

1343
02:14:16,979 --> 02:14:18,260
that said

1344
02:14:18,260 --> 02:14:19,699
Hey, um

1345

Just want to let you know the kids were watching your stream because they love lego star wars and we had to mute you

1346
02:14:26,579 --> 02:14:28,579
Because you kept saying fuck so much

1347
02:14:29,060 --> 02:14:32,500
Oh, it's the console. All right. Hold on. Let me show you the console

1348
02:14:33,300 --> 02:14:43,439

1350
02:14:45,649 --> 02:14:48,199
Shit that you saw it

1351
02:14:48,199 --> 02:14:50,119
God damn it. It's

1352
02:14:50,119 --> 02:14:52,119
It's black tourmaline

1353
02:14:52,359 --> 02:14:58,359
It's like a crystal bracelet. I I i'm just wearing it because um, uh, it's a crystal bracelet

1354
02:14:58,359 --> 02:15:00,359
It's black tourmaline

1355
02:15:01,159 --> 02:15:05,640
And it's uh supposed to help with your energy. It's not it's made up like it's literally all made up

1356
02:15:06,279 --> 02:15:08,680
This is kind of how it's just kind of how I feel

1357
02:15:09,399 --> 02:15:14,119
It's like 40 percent of every day. Can I tell you that not like that? Not like that. Not like that. Not like that

1358
02:15:16,039 --> 02:15:17,640
So

1359
02:15:17,640 --> 02:15:19,640
What can I do for you?

1360
02:15:21,880 --> 02:15:23,880
Paseo del mar high

1361
02:15:26,199 --> 02:15:28,199
No, no, no, no, no

Oh my god, it's too bad. No, this is gonna be

1363
02:15:31,880 --> 02:15:45,880
I'm gonna make it more expensive. I'm gonna make it more expensive. All right, i'm gonna turn it off. I'm gonna turn it off

1364
02:15:45,880 --> 02:15:51,880
I gotta make it more expensive. I I I I remember i'm mid piss. I'm peeing. It's mid piss

1365
02:15:51,880 --> 02:15:56,119
It's like a 20 to 30 second full piss. This didn't even have it on stream 10 seconds into the full piss

1366
02:15:57,250 --> 02:15:59,729
I drop it right right it and i'm pissing on the phone

1367
02:15:59,729 --> 02:16:03,329
I'm pissing on the phone and it's in piss water into the toilet peeing on it

1368
02:16:05,270 --> 02:16:07,270
There we are

1369
02:16:22,850 --> 02:16:25,409
What happened okay, so

1370
02:16:25,810 --> 02:16:28,210
So what has happened is I press the back button

1371
02:16:28,609 --> 02:16:34,340
And this is when I uh when I searched for ai dungeon an hour and a half ago to play it and I spelt it

1372
02:16:34,659 --> 02:16:36,280
uh

1373
02:16:36,280 --> 02:16:38,280
Just a little a little incorrect

1374
02:16:40,690 --> 02:16:49,030
What what's this doing on here what's this doing on here oh shit

1375
02:16:49,989 --> 02:17:02,600
Where is this picture? What's wrong with this one? It wasn't on fucking purpose. I swear to god. I swear to god. I swear to god

1376
02:17:09,829 --> 02:17:11,829
Why are you doing this?

1377
02:17:12,760 --> 02:17:18,680
No, no, I just I just I just I just own the raving rabbits fucking ultimate party collection, which is every single video game they made

1378
02:17:27,200 --> 02:17:41,409
Come on what

1379
02:17:55,010 --> 02:17:57,010
Hey german on 85 here

1380
02:18:01,010 --> 02:18:06,440
Lee shit, this is something I can't show on stream

1381
02:18:17,299 --> 02:18:18,819
As you see

1382
02:18:18,819 --> 02:18:20,979
uh new category new, uh

1383
02:18:21,780 --> 02:18:23,459
new thing to

1384
02:18:23,459 --> 02:18:26,280
feed through right

1385
02:18:26,280 --> 02:18:28,479
feed through

1386
02:18:28,479 --> 02:18:30,479
Oh, he's getting zonked on stream

1387
02:18:31,329 --> 02:18:33,969
Uh, so the winner of the uh, best accident

1388
02:18:34,979 --> 02:18:36,979
He's fucking zooted

1389
02:18:38,719 --> 02:18:40,719
Best accident was you

1390
02:18:47,079 --> 02:18:49,079
Oh

1391
02:18:49,639 --> 02:18:54,280
Mother fuck

1392
02:18:54,280 --> 02:18:57,409
Okay. Anyways, the winner of

1393
02:18:59,110 --> 02:19:01,719
the winner of

1394
02:19:01,719 --> 02:19:06,200
best accident is

1395
02:19:08,040 --> 02:19:15,860
Wait, you didn't hear it. Come on at 18.5 percent of the vote chuck e cheese

1396
02:19:23,200 --> 02:19:30,290
I just keep thinking about that guy said over and over again, uh kissing chuck e cheese was at 18.5 percent of the vote

1397
02:19:31,440 --> 02:19:33,920
Uh, that was very bad very bad accident

1398
02:19:34,959 --> 02:19:38,879
If you were not here for that stream, like I said chuck e earlier chuck e cheese rated the stream

1399
02:19:39,680 --> 02:19:42,479
And was here and we were being fucking weird

1400
02:19:42,879 --> 02:19:46,000
And then somebody linked a picture of me kissing him and I showed it on stream accidentally

1401
02:19:46,399 --> 02:19:52,719
And he was here and he was hosting the channel. So that's a pretty big accident. Uh, that was 18.5 percent and then naked

1402
02:19:53,430 --> 02:19:59,489
Was 16.9. So that was it's still close. So just under 17 percent for naked and

1403
02:20:00,370 --> 02:20:08,899
Streaming and driving was 12.6 percent number three. Uh, I don't know. I'm not sure I agree with number three

1404
02:20:09,219 --> 02:20:15,270
I think i'm gonna put something else there. Uh, lego star wars was robbed

1405
02:20:17,510 --> 02:20:24,129
Uh, yeah, kissing chuck e cheese is the winner, which I mean that was a pretty horrible fucking accident. So, uh

1406
02:20:24,770 --> 02:20:35,120
What do we have left? That's not the final four. Okay, here we are. So this next one coming up is

1407
02:20:35,840 --> 02:20:37,729
worst meltdown

1408
02:20:37,729 --> 02:20:39,969
Which worse meltdown is different than a lot

1409
02:20:40,530 --> 02:20:42,530
it's it's hard to do worse meltdown because

1410
02:20:43,620 --> 02:20:47,159
So many of the nominees could be entire streams

1411
02:20:47,559 --> 02:20:51,799
so it's not necessarily just one moment or two moments or

1412
02:20:53,030 --> 02:20:55,190
It it could be the whole entire broadcast

1413
02:20:55,510 --> 02:20:59,510
So we kind of let it things pass where it could be just a full stream

1414
02:20:59,670 --> 02:21:06,450
So keep that in mind when you're watching these nominees 13 straight hours of it potentially

1415
02:21:06,530 --> 02:21:12,870
Yeah, uh here are the nominees for worst meltdown of the year either moment or stream in particular

1416
02:21:31,719 --> 02:21:34,280
I'm gonna lose

1417
02:21:34,280 --> 02:21:37,739
Oh my god. Oh my god. I just broke something

1418
02:21:44,629 --> 02:21:47,709
He's having a little cranky wanky right now

1419
02:21:47,709 --> 02:21:49,709
Oh

1420
02:22:09,870 --> 02:22:15,709
But we're at we're on the last fucking disc i'm so close to ripping it out and just

02:22:15,950 --> 02:22:18,350
Frisbeeing it. How come my game's not doing that?

1422
02:22:19,790 --> 02:22:23,149

1423
02:22:23,950 --> 02:22:25,870
Shit just you

1425
02:22:29,629 --> 02:22:31,709
I didn't do anything. I just went left three times

1426
02:22:35,069 --> 02:22:37,069
I've already fucking lost my place. Oh, I

1427
02:22:38,520 --> 02:22:40,760
And then I don't know. I don't I don't I forget

1428
02:22:41,790 --> 02:22:43,790
I forget already. Oh

1443
02:24:27,209 --> 02:24:29,209

02:24:29,610 --> 02:24:33,229

1445
02:24:33,629 --> 02:24:36,379

02:24:42,209 --> 02:24:50,639
This oh my god, you can't you can't but i'm do you see what's happening

1447
02:24:54,370 --> 02:25:03,200
Oh

1448
02:25:21,889 --> 02:25:26,450
You see that button right there how it's made out of the most slippery fucking plastic notes, man

1449
02:25:27,010 --> 02:25:28,530
You see that button?

1450
02:25:28,530 --> 02:25:31,350
You see that shiny plastic ass fucking a button

1451
02:25:50,159 --> 02:25:52,530
Cranky wanky, right?

1452
02:25:53,409 --> 02:25:57,729
Uh too too many good ones. They were a lot this year. There's a lot of bad ones

1453
02:25:58,370 --> 02:26:00,370
Uh, but they can only be one winner

1454
02:26:00,370 --> 02:26:02,610
And I could have guessed this was going to be the one that wins

1455
02:26:03,250 --> 02:26:07,780
This is also, uh, not only does this win worst meltdown of the year

1456
02:26:08,260 --> 02:26:11,860
It also takes the cake for being the longest stream i've ever done and ever will

1457
02:26:14,790 --> 02:26:19,989
Lord of the rings the two towers, uh, that was a 13.4 13 and a half hour stream

1458
02:26:20,870 --> 02:26:27,010
It uh was hell from start to finish with 24 percent of the vote

1459
02:26:27,489 --> 02:26:33,909
Lord of the rings two towers underneath that you have super monkey ball with 19 percent and then super mario sunshine

1460
02:26:34,549 --> 02:26:38,899
At 17.7 percent cranky wanky

1461
02:26:40,840 --> 02:26:43,319
So there are your uh winners for worst meltdown

1462
02:26:44,040 --> 02:26:46,500
and now

1463
02:26:46,500 --> 02:26:50,370
We got another match. Let's move over to the uh wwe game

1464
02:26:51,959 --> 02:27:00,659
Match number four of the evening. Uh, this one you will be able to bet on I will just make that really clear

1465
02:27:00,659 --> 02:27:05,159
Let me just send the mods what they need to get you will be able to bet on this one

1466
02:27:05,399 --> 02:27:22,559
Let me just tell the mods who it is. I had to write that like six times

1467
02:27:24,610 --> 02:27:27,809
Okay, so this is a one-on-one. This is gonna be a one-on-one backstage

1468
02:27:28,430 --> 02:27:29,569
brawl

1469
02:27:29,569 --> 02:27:37,030
From what I have heard someone's going all in all in i'll be careful be careful

1470
02:27:37,670 --> 02:27:41,959
one-on-one backstage

1471
02:27:42,040 --> 02:27:46,309
brawl between none other than

1472
02:27:47,030 --> 02:27:49,030
Well, you're just gonna have to see aren't you?

1473
02:27:50,709 --> 02:27:53,110
Just gonna have to wait and see for it to load

1474
02:27:53,670 --> 02:28:01,520
And I will turn it back on I will tell you that this is uh, two very powerful beings

1475
02:28:01,920 --> 02:28:08,690
We have one of the most powerful current memes on the channel versus the potentially most powerful being on the channel

1476
02:28:08,930 --> 02:28:17,299
We're gonna have to see why don't we take a look right now?

1477
02:28:23,379 --> 02:28:25,239
uh

1478
02:28:25,239 --> 02:28:28,200
Wait, what they didn't even do it in the entrances

1479
02:28:29,159 --> 02:28:30,760
that's

1480
02:28:30,760 --> 02:28:33,000
That's germa dump truck versus jex

1481
02:28:33,559 --> 02:28:38,280
In a one-on-one backstage brawl. This is like an apahara movie

1482
02:28:42,899 --> 02:28:44,899
The dump truck versus jex

1483
02:28:45,700 --> 02:28:47,200
I

1484
02:28:47,200 --> 02:28:50,319
Don't know why they're out back and why he's just murdering him out back

1485
02:28:52,549 --> 02:28:55,110
Uh start the prediction, please. Who do you think is gonna win this match?

1486
02:28:57,239 --> 02:28:59,239
Why are they in some weird?

1487
02:28:59,319 --> 02:29:07,299
Germa dump truck seems to have all right into the table

1488
02:29:10,149 --> 02:29:12,149
I hope they use the outhouse to their advantage

1489
02:29:13,860 --> 02:29:19,540
Jex wearing his uh, his jex suit which gives him plus 25. Okay. He's already through the table

1490
02:29:20,100 --> 02:29:23,620
Do you have a dump truck just dumping on jex through the table?

1491
02:29:24,920 --> 02:29:27,719
Jex is he got so fucked up. He's got gray hair now

1492
02:29:28,760 --> 02:29:29,719
What?

1493
02:29:29,719 --> 02:29:32,079
He just broke his neck

1494
02:29:32,079 --> 02:29:34,079
You're going to have time to

1495
02:29:34,159 --> 02:29:37,120
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

1496
02:30:00,399 --> 02:30:04,079
So many you guys just got so screwed you guys got so screwed

1497
02:30:05,829 --> 02:30:08,129
It happened too fast

1498
02:30:08,129 --> 02:30:10,129
You got destroyed

1499
02:30:11,430 --> 02:30:16,629
Oh my god, I can't what am I supposed to do about that? Some of you guys just got absolutely decimated right there

1500
02:30:20,739 --> 02:30:22,739
Oh my god, that's so funny

1501
02:30:22,899 --> 02:30:25,649
Um, okay. I can't

1502
02:30:25,649 --> 02:30:29,329
All right. That's what I kind of want. I just I kind of want to see it again. Oh, wait, hold on

1503
02:30:32,850 --> 02:30:35,409
We'll go back. We'll go back and do a regular match after

1504
02:30:36,229 --> 02:30:38,229
We'll do a regular match

1505
02:30:38,389 --> 02:30:41,010
after

1506
02:30:41,010 --> 02:30:43,010
I can't refund he lost

1507
02:30:44,280 --> 02:30:46,280
You guys don't accept anymore

1508
02:30:49,040 --> 02:30:51,040
Uh, do you pay out? I mean

1509
02:30:52,770 --> 02:30:56,450
All right. I don't pull it out pull it out. Send the money back. Send the money back. Send the money back

1510
02:30:56,690 --> 02:31:00,450
Send the money back. I think I don't know. I have no idea. This is a horrible scenario

1511
02:31:02,549 --> 02:31:06,069
No, pay it out pay it out pay it out pay it out pay it out pay it out pay it out

1512
02:31:08,200 --> 02:31:13,440
What happened? Did it do pay out?

1513
02:31:13,680 --> 02:31:16,559
I don't know, dude

1514
02:31:16,559 --> 02:31:19,040
I don't know. I don't know. It was because people could still vote

1515
02:31:22,049 --> 02:31:24,930
All right. Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen

1516
02:31:25,989 --> 02:31:31,909
We're gonna all right. Listen, we're gonna refund the money. We're gonna refund the money and we're gonna do it again

1517
02:31:37,379 --> 02:31:39,379
It happened too fast, dude

1518
02:31:39,379 --> 02:31:41,559
Oh and fade out

1519
02:31:41,639 --> 02:31:44,200
Okay. Well now that you saw that it's time for a rematch

1520
02:31:45,270 --> 02:31:49,030
It's too late. Okay. Well, whatever if we look at the ship that shit's gonna happen

1521
02:31:49,989 --> 02:31:51,270
Hey

1522
02:31:51,270 --> 02:31:56,389
All you guys that just lost right there. Here you go. You've got another opportunity because we're gonna do another prediction right now

1523
02:31:57,030 --> 02:32:03,079
We're gonna do the one right now same match, you know, what just happened. Do you think he can do it again?

1524
02:32:08,840 --> 02:32:11,399
Dump truck is too powerful. I don't is he though

1525
02:32:12,040 --> 02:32:18,120
No, there's like errors

1526
02:32:18,600 --> 02:32:20,280
on predictions

1527
02:32:20,280 --> 02:32:28,180
Whatever. Are we ready to do another prediction though? You guys let's do it again

1528
02:32:29,350 --> 02:32:31,350
This is for a german dump truck versus jex

1529
02:32:32,209 --> 02:32:38,370
Same place and i'm gonna give you time now

1530
02:32:43,969 --> 02:32:46,930
So you have an opportunity here if you think that jump truck's gonna do that again

1531
02:32:47,729 --> 02:32:51,170
Or if jex is gonna snap out of it here lose a little bit of that gray hair

1532
02:32:52,360 --> 02:32:53,639
And go for it

1533
02:32:53,639 --> 02:33:01,879
What do you guys think?

1534
02:33:01,879 --> 02:33:03,879
We're gonna close the prediction here

1535
02:33:05,750 --> 02:33:07,329
uh in about

1536
02:33:07,329 --> 02:33:08,850
I'd say a minute

1537
02:33:08,850 --> 02:33:11,590
One minute we can maybe close it out

1538
02:33:11,590 --> 02:33:18,049
You guys all know what's gonna happen

1539
02:33:18,129 --> 02:33:21,879
So are we ready? Are we ready to close it? Have you made your bets?

1540
02:33:24,520 --> 02:33:26,629
All right

1541
02:33:26,629 --> 02:33:29,110
Close that up

1542
02:33:29,110 --> 02:33:36,079
I'm gonna start it right now

1543
02:33:36,079 --> 02:33:38,200
Okay, are we closed?

1544
02:33:38,200 --> 02:33:39,399
my safe

1545
02:33:39,399 --> 02:33:46,370
To press this button

1546
02:33:46,370 --> 02:33:48,370
It has to run down the timer. Oh

1547
02:33:51,219 --> 02:33:54,579
All right. Well, I don't think that's gonna happen again. So I think we have I think we're good

1548
02:33:55,139 --> 02:33:59,360
I'm gonna wait till it gets down to like a third. Okay

1549
02:34:03,829 --> 02:34:05,989
Now i'm like scared. Okay ready in three

1550
02:34:07,170 --> 02:34:07,969
two

1551
02:34:07,969 --> 02:34:09,569
one

1552
02:34:09,569 --> 02:34:14,959
go

1553
02:34:14,959 --> 02:34:16,469
Rematch

1554
02:34:16,469 --> 02:34:19,909
Right off the bat jex with a clothesline all you have to do. You have to kill your opponent

1555
02:34:21,190 --> 02:34:23,190
All you guys that just bet against jex

1556
02:34:24,370 --> 02:34:29,489
Oh, I don't know. You still have an opportunity betting against but we saw dump truck kill him in two moves

1557
02:34:32,819 --> 02:34:34,260
just carrying him and

1558
02:34:34,260 --> 02:34:37,459
Dropping him directly onto his onto his big bulbous

1559
02:34:38,159 --> 02:34:45,350
Bunger burger, but that doesn't hurt him very much going over to the trash can here picking up a sludge hammer

1560
02:34:45,969 --> 02:34:49,540
completely misses

1561
02:34:49,540 --> 02:34:52,260
Ankle lock. No, no, no, no. No, he's going to what's he gonna do?

1562
02:34:52,819 --> 02:34:57,430
Take him right in the chest. They're being a lot more timid this time. They're not like instantly hurting each other

1563
02:34:57,430 --> 02:35:00,579
So maybe that this is better

1564
02:35:00,579 --> 02:35:03,540
dump truck versus jex right onto the sludge hammer

1565
02:35:08,120 --> 02:35:09,879
Why what was that sound?

1566
02:35:09,879 --> 02:35:11,879
That was like somebody getting shocked with a taser

1567
02:35:12,530 --> 02:35:14,209
It's like a stun gun

1568
02:35:14,209 --> 02:35:15,569
Uh-oh

1569
02:35:15,569 --> 02:35:17,569
This does not look good for jex

1570
02:35:18,129 --> 02:35:20,129
Remember, you just have to kill your opponent

1571
02:35:21,379 --> 02:35:23,700
With the steel no didn't steal it but he still hit him with it

1572
02:35:25,920 --> 02:35:27,780
That might have killed him

1573
02:35:27,780 --> 02:35:32,840
Nope, he's still alive

1574
02:35:32,840 --> 02:35:36,520
Jex is not even transformed by the way into super jex. He can only do that once every five years

1575
02:35:37,920 --> 02:35:39,920
Takes he's hitting with a skull

1576
02:35:40,790 --> 02:35:46,100
Big reversal by germa's dump truck. This looks pretty even

1577
02:35:46,819 --> 02:35:49,139
Look at those health bars. This is of anybody's match right now

1578
02:35:53,559 --> 02:35:56,069
I would love to see you outhouse

1579
02:35:56,069 --> 02:35:58,950
I would love to see going over to the outhouse and just like giving him a swirly

1580
02:36:03,110 --> 02:36:05,909
Punch right hand. No reversal right elbow

1581
02:36:07,270 --> 02:36:10,389
Triple elbow he hit his head on one of those he hit his head on one of those

1582
02:36:11,030 --> 02:36:14,069
He smashed his head on like a rock at one of those skulls

1583
02:36:15,030 --> 02:36:18,790
Completely missing a few times dump truck does not have eyes. He's just an ass

1584
02:36:19,510 --> 02:36:21,590
Remember he has to go by smell

1585
02:36:23,110 --> 02:36:27,270
Yep, I just said that I just did and I apologize to 22,000 people

1586
02:36:33,649 --> 02:36:37,969
This is looking bad for jex. That was a neckbreaker on the ground. The neckbreaker always is just deadly

1587
02:36:39,409 --> 02:36:42,370
Uh-oh jex is in a lot of trouble

1588
02:36:43,090 --> 02:36:46,709
For the second time in a row unless he pulls something out right here

1589
02:36:49,239 --> 02:36:54,040
Can we get any momentum at all from jex? He's just getting absolutely destroyed his health is almost at zero

1590
02:36:55,590 --> 02:36:57,590
And he's going to

1591
02:37:03,809 --> 02:37:05,809
Okay, jex's

1592
02:37:08,639 --> 02:37:10,639
Jex seems to not uh

1593
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
Man, maybe jex is getting old too

1594
02:37:15,600 --> 02:37:18,879
Oh, no

1595
02:37:18,879 --> 02:37:24,000
Is my ass more powerful than the rest of my body at peak pinnacle condition?

1596
02:37:25,379 --> 02:37:27,379
That's what that whole bit was

1597
02:37:29,889 --> 02:37:31,010
Oh, well

1598
02:37:31,010 --> 02:37:36,319
Uh, that is it. That's open. That's another win back to back there from uh derma's uh derma's dump truck

1599
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
Time to bring out super jex

1600
02:37:42,319 --> 02:37:44,950
He's screaming

1601
02:37:44,950 --> 02:37:47,190
All right, that is gonna take us guys

1602
02:37:48,309 --> 02:37:51,059
to

1603

It's over on a tower i'm all right. I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm okay. Okay

1717
02:49:52,559 --> 02:49:54,799
Okay, this is gonna be really hard one

1718
02:49:55,600 --> 02:49:58,399
It's not t's either. Uh, does anyone want to start with w?

1719
02:49:59,280 --> 02:50:01,360
Yes, yes, it's true that it could be could be that

1720
02:50:01,920 --> 02:50:07,120

He's got one hp come on come on put all of your destructive power

1724
02:51:10,209 --> 02:51:11,889
So somebody made a pretty good point

1725
02:51:11,889 --> 02:51:14,530
Uh, which is actually very funny half of those moments

1726
02:51:15,250 --> 02:51:17,889
Are just sort of normal things that like a good gamer could do

1727
02:51:18,690 --> 02:51:20,870
but for us, uh, it's

1728
02:51:20,930 --> 02:51:25,350
Spectacular

1729
02:51:25,350 --> 02:51:26,469
the winner

1730
02:51:26,469 --> 02:51:28,469
Of best gamer moment of the year

1731
02:51:29,030 --> 02:51:35,139
I'm gonna pat myself on the back for this one. I think I did pretty well in the streams two of them, right?

1732
02:51:36,079 --> 02:51:41,270
Uh, the winner is

1733
02:51:41,270 --> 02:51:42,790
hades

1734
02:51:42,790 --> 02:51:45,110
Beating hades go not beating hades, right?

1735
02:51:45,909 --> 02:51:51,540
Killing hades the boss on my third attempt. That was 26.6 percent of the vote

1736
02:51:51,620 --> 02:51:54,739
I mean, I think come on that that's worth a little bit of celebration

1737
02:51:55,379 --> 02:51:57,190
Just a little

1738
02:51:57,190 --> 02:52:01,350
Uh 26.6 percent and then rhythm heaven shooter pog was 14.9 percent

1739
02:52:01,350 --> 02:52:06,280
Also, I think I gotta give myself some credit for that one and then binding of eyes a god build

1740
02:52:06,680 --> 02:52:16,469
To kill mega satan with 10.8 percent of the vote was in third place cat sucks at hades

1741
02:52:22,290 --> 02:52:29,489
Uh, we have the final two categories here before the rumble and we have about 45 minutes before the ball drops in new york

1742
02:52:29,889 --> 02:52:33,680
Perfect timing because everybody is from new york on the rumble. So that's good

1743
02:52:34,399 --> 02:52:36,399
the last two categories of the year are

1744
02:52:37,479 --> 02:52:46,000
Worst stream of the year and best stream of the year two categories that could be a lot in them

1745
02:52:47,090 --> 02:52:51,729
I don't want to accidentally leak who wins. So we're gonna start with worst stream of the year

1746
02:52:52,129 --> 02:52:56,719
There's a few I could think of but I don't want to uh spoil anything for those that may not have seen

1747
02:52:57,809 --> 02:53:03,809
Uh, so here we go. Here comes the worst streams that I did in 2020 according to you

1748
02:53:04,129 --> 02:53:20,899
I didn't do it supposed to kill these guys

1749
02:53:21,299 --> 02:53:27,299
Impressed

1750
02:53:30,290 --> 02:53:39,879
Did I crash oh shit, I think it just needed a few minutes to load dude, this looks fine

1751
02:53:42,209 --> 02:53:45,409
I'll be back. Give me five minutes fucking turn the computer. I'm just turning the computer up

1752
02:53:45,409 --> 02:53:49,809
I'm not even gonna turn the stream up. I'm gonna just i'm just turning off the computer. I'm restarting. I can't even restart my computer

1753
02:53:58,309 --> 02:54:00,309
Okay, don't buy this game

02:54:26,420 --> 02:54:27,780
I would rather eat my own hand

1761
02:54:27,780 --> 02:54:32,020
I'd rather you cut my fucking hand off and put it in the oven and cook it at like 350 for two hours

1762
02:54:32,659 --> 02:54:35,860
And I eat it on stream i'd rather do that than go back and do

Okay, I have to pay attention. Why do you guys hate this game?

1767
02:54:51,059 --> 02:54:55,649
Why does everybody hate this?

1768
02:54:55,649 --> 02:55:00,450
What this game is like fun and exciting and there's like characters and what you guys hate this game

1769
02:55:04,659 --> 02:55:09,909
Do you want me to do it again?

1770
02:55:27,459 --> 02:55:30,579
Don't kill them kill them kill them kill them

1771
02:55:34,739 --> 02:55:36,440

1772
02:55:36,440 --> 02:55:38,959
Oh

02:55:38,959 --> 02:55:40,959

1774
02:55:47,700 --> 02:55:50,180

1775
02:55:50,899 --> 02:55:53,040
Wait, what?

1776
02:55:53,040 --> 02:55:55,040
No, it's the tournament

1777
02:55:55,040 --> 02:55:56,879
Don't kill each other

1778
02:55:56,879 --> 02:56:00,340
Okay, if a stream is the worst stream of 2020 guaranteed

1779
02:56:01,569 --> 02:56:05,809
We can remove it from the list, right? Like yeah, this is everything else is an honorable mention at this point, right?

1780
02:56:06,129 --> 02:56:08,129
Oh shit, I fell through the world

1781
02:56:09,319 --> 02:56:12,129
Oh

1782
02:56:15,360 --> 02:56:17,360
Please tell me you can see this

1783
02:56:17,680 --> 02:56:20,959
I'm killing everybody. He was torturing his fans

1784
02:56:21,760 --> 02:56:27,799
Oh fuck. I keep I keep like laughing. I was too much today. I'm gonna be in pain

1785
02:56:31,620 --> 02:56:33,620
Somebody likes this here

1786
02:56:33,780 --> 02:56:35,620
Somebody likes this. I know they do

1787
02:56:35,620 --> 02:56:40,049
All right. My tongue's fucking fucked up. Come on. Say it. Oh my god muck ass

1788
02:56:41,360 --> 02:56:43,360
minus 300 viewers

1789
02:56:43,360 --> 02:56:44,959
Look at it

1790
02:56:44,959 --> 02:56:46,959
600 people left. It's my fault

1791
02:56:49,030 --> 02:56:50,870
No, that's that's on them

1792
02:56:50,870 --> 02:56:55,719
Guys for all you know, 600 people just got like a fucking call and they had to get on a phone call

1793
02:56:55,799 --> 02:56:59,799
They had to go to like the doctor or something or they were going to eat dinner or it was not to go to bed

1794
02:57:00,360 --> 02:57:02,440
You don't know it's my fault. I had nothing to do with it

1795
02:57:09,989 --> 02:57:14,389
So yes, um, so hold on there we go. So yes, sometimes I have bad streams

1796
02:57:16,639 --> 02:57:19,409
Sometimes they can't all be good ones

1797
02:57:20,049 --> 02:57:22,049
They they can't all be good

1798
02:57:22,129 --> 02:57:26,180
Sometimes you have to have a couple of stinkers but uh by

1799
02:57:27,569 --> 02:57:29,569
No, you don't sometimes sometimes sometimes

1800
02:57:30,030 --> 02:57:38,079
Sometimes i'm gonna let that slide

1801
02:57:38,959 --> 02:57:41,510
It's your birthday

1802
02:57:41,510 --> 02:57:48,760
The winner of the worst stream of the entire year of 2020. I mean, okay

1803
02:57:49,239 --> 02:57:52,200
If it's the worst game of 2020, does that matter?

1804
02:57:52,760 --> 02:58:00,600
Does that actually matter too? Like what if it's the worst fucking game that came out in 2020 watch dogs legion?

1805
02:58:01,840 --> 02:58:05,440
Uh at 38.5 percent of the vote watch dogs legion

1806
02:58:06,079 --> 02:58:11,450
Took that by a lot, but the died allison counter was at 31

1807
02:58:13,319 --> 02:58:14,790
so

1808
02:58:14,790 --> 02:58:18,149
Really like almost 70 percent of the entire vote was those two streams

1809
02:58:18,719 --> 02:58:21,440
So you have to imagine that those are probably the worst ones

1810
02:58:22,629 --> 02:58:32,760
Uh ftk 2 was there at 13.2 percent way lower than the 31 from died allison counter. So 70 percent of you thought those two

1811
02:58:33,239 --> 02:58:44,040
I could probably agree you did tearless after watch dog. You did you did you did tearless after watch dogs

1812
02:58:44,360 --> 02:58:52,950
Did I but only like a few minutes though, right an upset. Well, then it's died allison counter. That's the next one

1813
02:58:54,200 --> 02:58:58,600
All right. We've made it to the final category of the evening and it's

1814
02:58:59,239 --> 02:59:04,129
It's the big one. It's the one that's worth all the money. This one's worth all the cash all the money

1815
02:59:05,409 --> 02:59:14,799
Best stream of the year i'm gonna peek might surprise a lot of you

1816
02:59:15,200 --> 02:59:17,840
This is probably going to surprise a lot of people here

1817
02:59:17,840 --> 02:59:22,000
It is going to be a lot of people that might be angry a lot of people that might be upset at this

1818
02:59:22,079 --> 02:59:28,950
Uh at what has happened here. We'll see it was very it was very contested

1819
02:59:28,950 --> 02:59:37,000

With 27.4 percent of the vote

1878
03:05:58,180 --> 03:06:01,139
Long drive is the winner of the best stream of the year

1879
03:06:04,920 --> 03:06:06,920
Beating the auto stream

1880
03:06:07,840 --> 03:06:08,940

1881
03:06:08,940 --> 03:06:12,479
19.2 percent of the vote

1882
03:06:12,479 --> 03:06:16,719
Beating all those those two beat casino inc at 11.7

1883
03:06:18,030 --> 03:06:22,659
11.7 percent for casino inc. They're your top three the auto stream. Um

1884
03:06:23,299 --> 03:06:26,370
Didn't win a lot of people thought that was gonna happen

1885
03:06:27,909 --> 03:06:29,909
Uh long drive with 27.4 percent

1886
03:06:31,329 --> 03:06:33,329
And I learned something about this channel

1887
03:06:33,729 --> 03:06:36,739
I've got to play more games with just fucking cars in them

1888
03:06:40,950 --> 03:06:51,299
Just need to be able to drive a car right up to the top of the list casino inc and third

1889
03:06:51,379 --> 03:06:54,899
I was surprised by that. I was um

1890
03:06:55,299 --> 03:06:57,299
So that's it for the new year's awards

1891
03:06:57,860 --> 03:07:00,520
But we now have the main event of the evening

1892
03:07:01,989 --> 03:07:06,409
What are we what we're about to do right now is finish the germa rumble 2020

1893
03:07:07,760 --> 03:07:15,280
With the actual rumble 30 participants the first rumble that has been on this channel in like two or three years

1894
03:07:16,319 --> 03:07:20,159
And i'm really happy that it could be done and be here for you guys to watch

1895
03:07:20,659 --> 03:07:22,819
Because i'm gonna enjoy it too. I'm gonna be watching right here

1896
03:07:23,649 --> 03:07:26,450
So let's take one more break before we're gonna count the the ball down too

1897
03:07:26,450 --> 03:07:30,049
We have like about 30 minutes that might actually happen in the middle

1898
03:07:30,610 --> 03:07:36,770
Of the game, so we'll see i'm gonna be right back one more time and when I come back

1899
03:07:38,280 --> 03:11:20,180
Rumble will begin see you guys in just a few minutes. Okay, so it is time for us to do

1900
03:11:21,059 --> 03:11:25,909
The rumble 30 participants enter only one can win

1901
03:11:26,469 --> 03:11:29,860
Hope you're all prepared

1902
03:11:29,860 --> 03:11:31,860
Maybe gotten another snack or

1903
03:11:32,420 --> 03:11:35,780
And I gotta actually pay attention here because the ball is probably gonna drop in the middle of this rumble

1904
03:11:35,860 --> 03:11:42,659
So I need to be able to have like a timer out here. Here we go. Give me a clock

1905
03:11:43,940 --> 03:11:48,159
All right. I have access to a clock

1906
03:11:48,159 --> 03:11:51,280
I do not want to show the game right now because it will spoil everything

1907
03:11:51,840 --> 03:11:56,879
So i'm not going to do that

1908
03:11:56,879 --> 03:12:07,170
I'm just gonna turn it on. Uh, if I can hold on a sec

1909
03:12:09,280 --> 03:12:11,440
I think i'm gonna have to resize the window

1910
03:12:12,079 --> 03:12:16,319
Let's see

1911
03:12:16,319 --> 03:12:19,680
Oh, come on

1912
03:12:19,680 --> 03:12:28,180
There we go. Okay. I need to get down here and turn the volume up because you guys can't hear it

1913
03:12:30,020 --> 03:12:32,200
There we go

1914
03:12:32,200 --> 03:12:33,959
Okay

1915
03:12:33,959 --> 03:12:36,719
All right. Let's go

1916
03:12:36,719 --> 03:12:39,459
Are you ready?

1917
03:12:39,459 --> 03:12:43,670

1918
03:12:48,020 --> 03:12:58,370
For the rumble portion. I'm about to turn it on in three

1919
03:12:59,250 --> 03:13:00,370
two

1920
03:13:00,370 --> 03:13:01,909
One

1921
03:13:01,909 --> 03:13:03,829
Here we go

1922
03:13:03,829 --> 03:13:07,780
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the wrestling portion

1923
03:13:10,879 --> 03:13:12,719
You know the rules

1924
03:13:12,719 --> 03:13:16,100
If you get thrown over the top rope you are eliminated

1925
03:13:19,520 --> 03:13:22,799
There is no re-entry and you have a random number

1926
03:13:26,209 --> 03:13:28,469
He will now explain everything I just explained

1927
03:13:39,879 --> 03:13:45,559
Superstars occur when a superstar is thrown over the top rope with both feet landing on the floor

1928
03:13:46,120 --> 03:13:48,280
The last superstar in the ring he's not even talking

1929
03:13:49,719 --> 03:13:52,520
Animatron up here and somebody's doing that from the booth upstairs

1930
03:13:55,989 --> 03:13:59,750
So who are the first two contestants in the 2020 rumble?

1931
03:14:00,790 --> 03:14:04,329
I don't know. We're about to find out. Oh, that would be the cheers to ucd

1932
03:14:07,799 --> 03:14:09,799
Gonna need some of that crowd

1933
03:14:10,440 --> 03:14:13,829
Hopefully does a great job

1934
03:14:13,829 --> 03:14:18,659
He's really hoping that he the crowd will get behind him for a change

1935
03:14:19,459 --> 03:14:21,459
Not him needing to get behind other people

1936
03:14:21,780 --> 03:14:26,920
with his audio tape

1937
03:14:26,920 --> 03:14:29,159
Cheers to you

1938
03:14:29,159 --> 03:14:31,159
We believe in you

1939
03:14:33,670 --> 03:14:35,670
We believe in you

1940
03:14:36,149 --> 03:14:38,149
But you're number one

1941
03:14:38,149 --> 03:14:40,309
So you probably won't do it

1942
03:14:40,870 --> 03:14:43,750
I will be shocked if you do cheers to you. Good luck to you

1943
03:14:45,040 --> 03:14:50,690
in this competition

1944
03:14:50,690 --> 03:14:54,799
So who is number two?

1945
03:14:54,799 --> 03:14:57,920
First two into the ring at the first moment of the rumble

1946
03:15:06,209 --> 03:15:08,209
Here it comes

1947
03:15:08,959 --> 03:15:13,110
Are you ready?

1948
03:15:13,190 --> 03:15:18,549
They're looking for the next contestant. I don't know where the next contestant is

1949
03:15:19,190 --> 03:15:22,469
Where why are they looking for the next contestant? They're supposed to come down

1950
03:15:24,870 --> 03:15:27,590
Well, no, everyone's excited. Of course they're excited

1951
03:15:28,309 --> 03:15:30,309
Because that's the mcdlt briefcase guy

1952
03:15:39,350 --> 03:15:41,350
Nailing all the way from 1981

1953
03:15:42,149 --> 03:15:44,149
During the pinnacle of the mcdlt

1954
03:15:44,770 --> 03:15:50,049
The guy in the front row that goes down drops to one knee with a briefcase in his hand and looks over and says cool cool

1955
03:15:51,190 --> 03:15:52,389
hot hot

1956
03:15:52,389 --> 03:15:54,719
incredibly powerful

1957
03:15:55,170 --> 03:15:57,170
And apparently incredibly sweaty

1958
03:15:57,250 --> 03:15:59,250
There's the mcdlt briefcase guy

1959
03:16:03,250 --> 03:16:05,250
I'm talking quarter pound of beef

1960
03:16:05,569 --> 03:16:08,389
Why is he out of the ring?

1961
03:16:08,389 --> 03:16:20,690
Did he just eliminate himself?

1962
03:16:20,690 --> 03:16:24,209
There's a serial killer behind those eyes. Well, I don't know much about that

1963
03:16:25,680 --> 03:16:27,680
I I just know that they're the two that start

1964
03:16:30,600 --> 03:16:34,700
USA here we go. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the germa rumble 2020

1965
03:16:35,729 --> 03:16:38,690
New year's eve don't let oh, come on mcdlt is my favorite character

1966
03:16:39,170 --> 03:16:43,010
Mcdlt guys my favorite character don't get eliminated instantly. Oh my fucking god

1967
03:16:45,840 --> 03:16:47,360
Why?

1968
03:16:47,360 --> 03:16:49,360
Oh, he's my favorite character

1969
03:16:50,959 --> 03:16:55,520
Favorite character somebody get here and just eliminate cheers to you. Oh, it's the pencil

1970
03:16:56,790 --> 03:17:00,149
The pencil is in the 2020 rumble. How is it possible?

1971
03:17:00,870 --> 03:17:02,870
the most hated character

1972
03:17:02,870 --> 03:17:04,870
The pencil was in the rumble

1973
03:17:05,729 --> 03:17:08,850
It's been like four years since we've seen the pencil

1974
03:17:10,020 --> 03:17:16,100
And cheers to you as just has so much power so much strength and nobody can even touch him so far

1975
03:17:17,989 --> 03:17:20,950
Oh my goodness a huge clothesline onto the pencil

1976
03:17:21,590 --> 03:17:26,389
We're gonna fill this ring up a little bit here. Someone's coming in at about 10. Good sweeping kick to the groin there

1977
03:17:27,909 --> 03:17:29,510
pencil has

1978
03:17:29,510 --> 03:17:31,510
Starting to dominate

1979
03:17:31,510 --> 03:17:33,510
And of course glue man coming in next

1980
03:17:34,500 --> 03:17:36,500
Glue man is your number four

1981
03:17:38,290 --> 03:17:39,809
There he is

1982
03:17:39,809 --> 03:17:41,409
With all of his glory

1983
03:17:41,409 --> 03:17:43,409
With his boston celtics boots

1984
03:17:43,489 --> 03:17:47,030
As the pencil rakes his eyes glue man now stuffed into the corner

1985
03:17:47,750 --> 03:17:50,309
Takes two three punches. It didn't even get a chance to show everybody

1986
03:17:51,030 --> 03:17:53,989
Now he's gonna reverse it cheers to you taking a breather here

1987
03:17:54,469 --> 03:17:59,750
After instantly eliminating my favorite character can the pencil be removed pencil is a former champion of the rumble, by the way

1988
03:18:00,149 --> 03:18:02,870
Really important for you to know. I think they're gonna double team

1989
03:18:03,909 --> 03:18:05,909
They are not going to double team

1990
03:18:08,309 --> 03:18:10,309
Dr smoochson coming in next at number five

1991
03:18:11,319 --> 03:18:13,590
as they're gonna oh

1992
03:18:13,590 --> 03:18:14,979
What?

1993
03:18:14,979 --> 03:18:17,479
No, that doesn't count. Is glue man eliminated

1994
03:18:24,770 --> 03:18:26,770
Okay glue man is not eliminated

1995
03:18:28,079 --> 03:18:30,879
Dr smoochson comes in we now got four competitors into the rumble

1996
03:18:31,360 --> 03:18:34,000
A lot of you guys probably would hate to see the pencil win again. So would I

1997
03:18:37,280 --> 03:18:40,959
The crowded ring here it comes who is going to be number six

1998

03:18:47,680 --> 03:18:49,680

Being eliminated germa thing coming in from the game the thing see if we can get a good

2001
03:18:56,159 --> 03:18:59,840
View of his face glue man. You're never gonna win man

2002
03:19:00,479 --> 03:19:02,479
Glue man's just never going to win

2003
03:19:02,799 --> 03:19:06,719
We all have to be completely honest with ourselves. He's just he's a lovable loser

2004
03:19:07,360 --> 03:19:09,200
I'm sorry glue man

2005
03:19:09,200 --> 03:19:13,280
It doesn't matter if I give you a hundred in every step. You're gonna get thrown out in the first five minutes

2006
03:19:15,670 --> 03:19:17,670
Cheers to you is still holding strong

2007
03:19:18,069 --> 03:19:20,340
well germa thing

2008
03:19:20,340 --> 03:19:22,340
Maybe not for long though. We'll see

2009
03:19:23,239 --> 03:19:26,040
I can't believe i'm seeing I cannot believe what i'm seeing right now

2010
03:19:26,920 --> 03:19:29,879
Gabe newell is coming in next and they're gonna double team eliminate him possibly

2011
03:19:31,299 --> 03:19:34,180
Cheers to you looking and he's got a valve index on he didn't

2012
03:19:34,899 --> 03:19:38,739
Instantly eliminates dr smoochson. Gabe newell is back and he is angry

2013
03:19:39,299 --> 03:19:41,940
For not being invited for the last three or four years in a row

2014
03:19:42,500 --> 03:19:44,870
showing off that index

2015
03:19:44,870 --> 03:19:47,829
Dr smoochson taking a huge. Oh, what is he doing?

2016
03:19:49,120 --> 03:19:52,559
Uh, dr smoochson dr smoochson just breathes in his own hand. Okay, that was weird

2017
03:19:53,200 --> 03:19:55,840
But gabe newell is looking for redemption in this rumble

2018
03:19:57,350 --> 03:19:59,510
If you remember the pencil and gabe newell

2019
03:20:00,069 --> 03:20:04,549
Had a huge rivalry and it looks like it's going to continue here as he gets dropped onto the top turnbuckle there

2020
03:20:05,510 --> 03:20:10,450
Number eight coming in is jigsaw with the gas the jigsaw doll

2021
03:20:11,479 --> 03:20:16,440
Derma thing on the edge of the rope there germa things gonna get eliminated. Oh, he's naughty holds on for his dear life

2022
03:20:18,959 --> 03:20:21,120
Pencil is going to eliminate. Oh, it's it's good

2023
03:20:23,040 --> 03:20:27,649
See his face

2024
03:20:28,719 --> 03:20:32,159
Cheers to you is still in it. He was the first competitor by the way

2025
03:20:33,200 --> 03:20:37,520
He got instantly gassed. He was coming to exit number nine. We got pac-man

2026
03:20:38,659 --> 03:20:40,659
Pac-man has entered the rumble

2027
03:20:49,729 --> 03:20:51,729
Gabe newell is still

2028
03:20:52,149 --> 03:20:55,090
Doing very well

2029
03:20:55,090 --> 03:20:57,090
Still got good green health

2030
03:20:57,250 --> 03:21:01,879
If I were him, I would go over in that corner. I would open up half-life alex and I would start chapter one

2031
03:21:02,840 --> 03:21:07,399
What a great game that wasn't what a great thing going after pac-man's back here

2032
03:21:08,360 --> 03:21:17,299
We're gonna have six competitors in the ring. And of course long drive dad is gonna make an appearance. He won best stream of the year

2033
03:21:19,280 --> 03:21:21,360
Why wouldn't long drive dad make an appearance

2034
03:21:25,299 --> 03:21:27,299
Can he sweep another category?

2035
03:21:27,459 --> 03:21:30,399
Called winning the rumble

2036
03:21:30,399 --> 03:21:35,059

Rings getting crowded. Yeah, it is cheers to you still in it

2038
03:21:39,680 --> 03:21:43,360
Big right hook onto long drive. Are they gonna fill more people in here?

2039
03:21:44,000 --> 03:21:46,000
Do not let this rivalry end this way game

2040
03:21:46,639 --> 03:21:48,799
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, it can't end like this

2041
03:21:49,520 --> 03:21:51,520
It can't end like this

2042
03:21:52,120 --> 03:21:55,879
Oh game newell holds on for dear life as travis touchdown comes in

2043
03:21:58,610 --> 03:22:00,209
Making his way in

2044
03:22:00,209 --> 03:22:06,229
Can't wait for that new game and he'll be playing that new game as travis touchdown comes on in cheers to you

2045
03:22:06,469 --> 03:22:08,469
Did cheers to you is gone

2046
03:22:09,879 --> 03:22:13,879
Long drive dad has eliminated cheers to you the longest person inside the ring so far

2047
03:22:14,520 --> 03:22:16,520
He made it 30% of the way through

2048
03:22:17,719 --> 03:22:19,239
It's sorry

2049
03:22:19,239 --> 03:22:20,520
He didn't win

2050
03:22:20,520 --> 03:22:26,100
Because now gabe newell has got long drive dad using the groin drop long drive. That's gonna get tossed up by gabe newell

2051
03:22:27,719 --> 03:22:30,760
He's got extra strength so far and who's coming in now this is

2052
03:22:32,120 --> 03:22:34,120
fortnight jimmy's coming in next

2053
03:22:38,799 --> 03:22:40,799
fortnight jimmy on his way in

2054
03:22:41,200 --> 03:22:42,870
as

2055
03:22:42,870 --> 03:22:46,389
As gabe newell and the pencil both try to eliminate long drive dad

2056
03:22:50,209 --> 03:22:52,209
We were talking shit and he's ready to go

2057
03:22:52,610 --> 03:22:54,479
It doesn't matter

2058
03:22:54,559 --> 03:22:59,120
I mean, it doesn't matter. I mean, he's he's he's only 13 and he really shouldn't be in here with a bunch of grown like

2059
03:22:59,200 --> 03:23:02,799
44 year olds and like 29 year olds, but um, like whatever

2060
03:23:03,600 --> 03:23:06,420
It's okay

2061
03:23:07,059 --> 03:23:10,319
It's a full ring right now

2062
03:23:10,639 --> 03:23:15,200
Reversal by germa thing onto germa pencil. That's not a germa pencil. That's just the pencil he sucks

2063
03:23:17,780 --> 03:23:20,520
No eliminations somebody has to get eliminated

2064
03:23:23,350 --> 03:23:26,469
That's a fake up from germa thing if i've ever seen one. I told you

2065
03:23:27,430 --> 03:23:34,899
Long drive dad's going out right here. No, he got distracted by travis touchdown long drive lives again to see another minute here

2066
03:23:38,719 --> 03:23:40,719
Fortnight jimmy like in math class

Through his pencil down after getting a 100 on it long drive dad. He's dealt with he's here. He has kids of his own

2068
03:23:49,329 --> 03:23:51,329
He's upset about that one

2069
03:23:51,489 --> 03:23:54,850
He has a dad for god's sake. No, he can't eliminate him

2070
03:23:55,809 --> 03:23:59,170
As germa 985 enters the arena, but no long drive dad cannot

2071
03:23:59,729 --> 03:24:04,290
Eliminate fortnight jimmy but germa germa with a full body cast on

2072
03:24:05,709 --> 03:24:10,690
2020 has been a little rough on germa 985, but he still has got the strength of at least 10 people

2073
03:24:11,889 --> 03:24:15,030
He still has the strength

2074
03:24:15,760 --> 03:24:17,760
long drive dad

2075
03:24:19,030 --> 03:24:21,329
Long drive dad needs to be

2076
03:24:35,700 --> 03:24:42,739
Just drops down an elevator shaft germa 985 you weren't gonna win man. You're at like 60% still

2077
03:24:45,780 --> 03:24:48,819
Travis touchdown now is in a lot of trouble with gabe newell

2078
03:24:49,780 --> 03:24:54,180
Travis touchdown is stuck on the ropes. Somebody get travis touchdown out of here

2083
03:25:16,870 --> 03:25:18,870
Lots of health still

2084
03:25:19,889 --> 03:25:21,889
Germa thing's been in here for a long time

2085
03:25:22,760 --> 03:25:24,760
Gabe newell's been in here for a long time

And somebody else is about to enter while gabe newell's and nancy drew's coming in hot here

03:25:36,450 --> 03:25:38,450
Won the crew battle

2089
03:25:39,030 --> 03:25:41,670
Drew crew prevailed and obviously she's celebrating for it

2090
03:25:44,819 --> 03:25:46,819
big suplex here

2091
03:25:47,430 --> 03:25:49,670
On fortnight jimmy by germa thing

2092
03:25:51,780 --> 03:25:56,899
Yeah, drew crew has taken a few wins today and that's it for fortnight jimmy germa thing freaked out

2093
03:25:57,700 --> 03:26:04,500
And then another elimination gabe newell just destroys long drive dad people are gonna be really upset by that one gabe newell on the hunt here

2094
03:26:05,299 --> 03:26:07,299
Maybe going for a second elimination in a row

2095
03:26:09,719 --> 03:26:15,780
Nancy drew with a big boot getting some taunting by gabe newell

2096
03:26:18,020 --> 03:26:20,020
i'm, not sure what what he's doing here, but he's

2097
03:26:20,659 --> 03:26:24,100
Maybe they're gonna work together and try to eliminate travis touchdown while germa thing's in a lot of trouble

2098
03:26:25,079 --> 03:26:27,079
An incoming nexus from lord of the rings

2099
03:26:27,559 --> 03:26:30,450
You know him as the dwarf

2100
03:26:30,450 --> 03:26:33,760
Here comes gimli

2101
03:26:33,760 --> 03:26:36,639
Nancy drew that's a really bad place to be right now. You don't want to be taunting up there

2102
03:26:40,360 --> 03:26:45,319
And my axe and my what's going on with his hair his hair is a life of its own

2103
03:26:49,379 --> 03:26:53,860
Big maneuver big double punch into the elbow drop right on the top of the skull

2104
03:26:57,159 --> 03:26:59,879
Gabe newell is just working on to gimli

2105
03:27:00,819 --> 03:27:03,139
For some reason gabe newell has it up with the lord of the rings

2106
03:27:06,000 --> 03:27:08,000
Huge elbow drop wait what?

2107
03:27:09,170 --> 03:27:11,920
pac-man has been eliminated

2108
03:27:11,920 --> 03:27:15,680
pac-man has been eliminated from the rumble and travis touchdown might be right after

2109
03:27:17,729 --> 03:27:19,750
Oh, no

2110
03:27:19,750 --> 03:27:20,870
Oh, no

2111
03:27:20,870 --> 03:27:25,190
Gabe newell has just been eliminated by germa thing and so has travis touchdown. We're getting down

2112
03:27:27,440 --> 03:27:30,959
To the to the few here

2113
03:27:31,120 --> 03:27:35,909
Nancy drew you got to get rid of nancy drew she's currently running on the high

2114
03:27:36,559 --> 03:27:38,559
Of her victory with the drew crew

2115
03:27:39,459 --> 03:27:41,860
I think gimli and germa thing have to work together and get her out of here

2116
03:27:42,180 --> 03:27:47,879
Unfortunately, gabe newell could not get the redemption that a lot of you think he may have deserved

2117
03:27:48,280 --> 03:27:55,120
It's okay his wall dad's coming in an older competitor from the last rumble

2118
03:27:55,760 --> 03:28:04,399
Wall dad going right. Oh, no, what a reversal by nancy drew. What is germa thing doing?

2119
03:28:04,879 --> 03:28:08,129
He's just pulling his hair

2120
03:28:08,209 --> 03:28:11,159
He's not gonna just

2121
03:28:11,399 --> 03:28:20,420
He is wild he is very wild and untamed is gimli gonna get dropped here

2122
03:28:21,219 --> 03:28:23,219
No, not quite not quite

2123
03:28:24,520 --> 03:28:26,280
next competitor is

2124
03:28:26,280 --> 03:28:34,629
Of course a jar of mayonnaise one of the most delicious snacks one of the most delicious additives you could possibly put on any food product

2125
03:28:36,040 --> 03:28:37,399
good on

2126
03:28:37,399 --> 03:28:42,129
French fries, it's good on turkey sandwiches. It's really good in tuna if you make like a tuna sandwich

2127
03:28:42,850 --> 03:28:46,930
Jar of mayonnaise it'll in a little goes a long way by the way, you don't have to use a whole lot

2128
03:28:47,170 --> 03:28:51,750
It's really good on some other stuff, too. It's good. Well, hold on. We got some action here

2129
03:28:53,360 --> 03:28:58,239
Gimli is about to eliminate germa thing is wall dad gonna let this happen. He is there he goes

2130
03:28:58,799 --> 03:29:06,790
That is the end for germa thing and here comes a pasta italiano chef from casino ink

2131
03:29:14,129 --> 03:29:16,129
Fuck somebody said fuck nancy

2132
03:29:19,360 --> 03:29:21,040
pasta italiano chef

2133
03:29:21,040 --> 03:29:27,989
You don't know they've had plenty of uh, plenty of really bad things happen to the restaurant into them always the subject of

2134
03:29:28,950 --> 03:29:30,629
attacks and

2135
03:29:30,629 --> 03:29:34,520
uh mob hits but here now to try to

2136
03:29:35,559 --> 03:29:38,629
Use some of their own firepower

2137
03:29:38,629 --> 03:29:44,530
That was a really really big move by the jar of mayonnaise and bf bugleberry is now number 19 coming in

2138
03:29:47,219 --> 03:29:49,399
Please don't all of you leave

2139
03:29:51,379 --> 03:29:52,500
Oh, yeah

2140
03:29:52,500 --> 03:29:57,030
Oh, yeah

2141
03:29:57,030 --> 03:30:02,709
Going right for wall dad. It's gonna be instant. Yeah, there he goes

2142
03:30:04,549 --> 03:30:06,790
That was very violent from bf bugleberry

2143
03:30:07,649 --> 03:30:11,090
Trying to get rid of the jar of mayonnaise nancy drew and bf bugleberry working together

2144
03:30:12,870 --> 03:30:17,670
And nope, it's he's very thick. He's very full of vitamins and minerals

2145
03:30:18,149 --> 03:30:21,110
You can't just get rid of mayonnaise that quickly don't pour it down the drain either

2146
03:30:21,430 --> 03:30:25,639
Throw it in you gotta like scoop it up and throw it like the trash and stuff. It can't go down the drain

2147
03:30:27,510 --> 03:30:36,500
Beanbag sonic has just entered the rumble and he's grown up now. He's not just a little shit anymore. He's a huge

2148
03:30:37,709 --> 03:30:38,930
muscly

2149
03:30:38,930 --> 03:30:40,930
fully evolved level 10

2150
03:30:41,719 --> 03:30:47,569
Monster rancher monster. It's been quite a while since we've seen beanbag sonic

2151
03:30:48,049 --> 03:30:55,079
He's been training and there goes the pasta italiano chef by gimli gone almost as fast as he came in

2152
03:30:55,559 --> 03:31:01,940
And here comes mr. Green

2153
03:31:01,940 --> 03:31:05,750
What is the jar of mayonnaise doing mr. Green coming in?

2154
03:31:06,309 --> 03:31:08,309
Looks like he lost his pants

2155
03:31:08,629 --> 03:31:11,190
In a game of poker, but he's here

2156
03:31:14,520 --> 03:31:18,840
Bf bugleberry gets dumped over and nancy drew gets eliminated. Oh no

2157
03:31:19,799 --> 03:31:22,040
I had high hopes for nancy drew. I thought she was going to go a long way

2158
03:31:22,040 --> 03:31:24,280
But mr green is on an absolute tirade here

2159
03:31:25,620 --> 03:31:26,899
He was so strong

2160
03:31:26,899 --> 03:31:32,920
He just picked up a level 10 monster rancher fully developed monster and just drew it like it was a fucking piece of cheese

2161
03:31:33,239 --> 03:31:39,729
Gimli is still sticking around. Look at that health though. Not doing well

2162
03:31:43,649 --> 03:31:46,149
Oh, nope. What are they doing?

2163
03:31:49,639 --> 03:31:51,299
What was that?

2164
03:31:51,299 --> 03:31:53,670
What was that?

2165
03:31:53,670 --> 03:31:56,709
And here comes chuck e cheese at number 22

2166
03:31:57,969 --> 03:32:01,170
Big power bomb on mr. Green from the jar of mayonnaise chuck e cheese

2167
03:32:01,729 --> 03:32:08,149
Everybody's favorite rat. Well, not everybody's favorite rat. I don't not really I don't think anyone

2168
03:32:08,309 --> 03:32:14,389
Favorite rat I could probably name a few that go in front. Um, jerry from ratatouille

2169
03:32:15,569 --> 03:32:18,520
Giant rat that makes all the rules. Um

2170
03:32:19,719 --> 03:32:21,799
Tom no jerry from tom and jerry

2171
03:32:24,610 --> 03:32:32,770
Well, it's from walson grommet. There's that one. Uh, there's that one rat short. It's a mouse whatever

2172
03:32:34,149 --> 03:32:38,469
Welcome chuck e cheese to the rumble. I hope we get instantly eliminated and murius is at number 23

2173
03:32:38,469 --> 03:32:40,469
We're getting down to the final eight

2174
03:32:41,000 --> 03:32:44,360
Final seven coming in here

2175
03:32:44,360 --> 03:32:48,120
Oh boy, would you love to see a murius gerba rumble 2020 win?

2176
03:32:48,200 --> 03:32:52,680
I'll tell you that's a good new year's eve present for me one of my favorite characters

2177
03:32:55,040 --> 03:33:00,180
That chuck e cheese is getting stomped by gimli gimli by the way still in here. There goes mr

2178
03:33:00,180 --> 03:33:05,479
Green by the jar of mayonnaise jar of mayo looking to be a pretty high seed here

2179
03:33:08,069 --> 03:33:14,309
And also representing the wink dinks here comes germa wink saw him lose earlier tonight, but that's okay

2180
03:33:16,180 --> 03:33:18,180
Still coming in to represent for the rumble

2181
03:33:18,260 --> 03:33:20,260
No, god damn it gimli fuck

2182
03:33:21,459 --> 03:33:23,459
No, why he's so good

2183
03:33:23,540 --> 03:33:23,860
All right

2184
03:33:23,860 --> 03:33:28,739
There's only one opportunity where i'm gonna say chuck e cheese is better than the lord of the rings and it's right now

2185
03:33:29,299 --> 03:33:31,299
This is the only time you'll ever hear me say that

2186
03:33:31,379 --> 03:33:33,540
Get rid of gimli. He's doing too good

2187
03:33:40,440 --> 03:33:43,559
Darmaio is just taking a little breather here. Who's number 25?

2188
03:33:44,959 --> 03:33:47,540
seaman

2189
03:33:47,540 --> 03:33:59,040
Here he comes from the dream cast seems to be also a full-grown adult and not just a little baby. Uh tadpole anymore

2190
03:34:00,760 --> 03:34:02,760
Beanbag sonic with a big suplex

2191
03:34:06,920 --> 03:34:12,930
Yeah, this is what you gotta get rid of gimli. You know, you get hey dink. Hey you fucking dink

2192
03:34:13,649 --> 03:34:17,569
Get rid of gimli together. He's he's like the top seed right now. You want it chuck e cheese?

2193
03:34:17,569 --> 03:34:21,159
Come on, go for it. Go for it. Go for it

2194
03:34:23,280 --> 03:34:25,920
G red is there he goes. Thank god for chuck e cheese

2195
03:34:27,840 --> 03:34:29,840
G red from gotcha force

2196
03:34:30,500 --> 03:34:36,079
Is the next competitor if he comes in I for some reason he's not coming down

2197
03:34:36,559 --> 03:34:39,639
Somebody needs to like turn the toy on

2198
03:34:39,639 --> 03:34:44,770
There he is the strongest of all the gotcha bots we have g red

2199
03:34:49,329 --> 03:34:54,370
Okay already already showing that he is very strong. Okay. He's like god

2200
03:34:56,260 --> 03:34:58,659
The gotcha force has made it to the germa arena

2201
03:35:03,299 --> 03:35:04,579
He's also

2202
03:35:04,579 --> 03:35:08,420
Weirdly enough weirdly enough. He is about four inches tall

2203
03:35:08,899 --> 03:35:14,659
But in the germa rumble universe, he is like eight feet tall and what's that? I see at number 27

2204
03:35:15,059 --> 03:35:20,959
What's that I see number 27 that is catboy germa catboy germa

2205
03:35:22,260 --> 03:35:27,059
Making their appearance for the first time in the germa arena just trying to see

2206
03:35:27,700 --> 03:35:31,299
Who to attack who to scratch who to bite at?

2207
03:35:32,200 --> 03:35:36,520
Going right for beanbag sonic. What an excellent idea catboy germa. No gets reversed

2208
03:35:39,479 --> 03:35:41,479
C man got your red

2209
03:35:41,809 --> 03:35:45,809
Catboy germa beanbag sonic a jar of mayonnaise and chuck e cheese

2210
03:35:46,870 --> 03:35:52,819
Are your potential final competitors potential final competitors?

2211
03:35:53,299 --> 03:35:58,180
Catboy germa's got the upper hand on beanbag sonic beanbag sonic. Yeah, you got it. You gotta do something

2212
03:35:58,420 --> 03:36:04,079
You gotta reverse it. There's a reversal there chuck e cheese. I just like choked himself

2213
03:36:05,510 --> 03:36:10,709
Double punch there onto they're just punching each other who comes in at number 29

2214
03:36:13,409 --> 03:36:15,409
Oh number 28 that would be

2215
03:36:16,610 --> 03:36:25,969
An andy mark robot from the carnival stream also dressed as the goat to andy mark for all your robot needs

2216
03:36:27,170 --> 03:36:30,899
You got a project going on andy mark. They're the ones

2217
03:36:33,110 --> 03:36:35,750
Coming right into the jar mayonnaise. They both have the same like color scheme

2218
03:36:40,469 --> 03:36:45,760
This is going to get really interesting because this is it after two what the hell is going on

2219
03:36:46,239 --> 03:36:52,399
Jar mayonnaise has a bunch of awesome moves catboy germa. No did not fall off of the top ropes and germa's germa's dump truck

2220
03:36:53,040 --> 03:36:55,520
One of the final competitors we could see an upset here

2221
03:37:00,440 --> 03:37:09,510
This could be very upsetting. Oh gotcha red coming in and there goes the jar mayonnaise unfortunate very unfortunate

2222
03:37:09,510 --> 03:37:13,989
But there he is. Why did the gotcha red just run over the ropes to eliminate himself?

2223
03:37:14,309 --> 03:37:24,579
No, he's still in what was that catboy germa into the end of the turnbuckle as chuck e cheese now trying to get some work done

2224
03:37:27,520 --> 03:37:33,379
Germa's dump truck gotcha red. Holy shit. It's almost midnight

2225
03:37:34,100 --> 03:37:36,340
Uh, what time is it? Wait, wait, wait, wait. It's almost midnight eastern

2226
03:37:37,940 --> 03:37:41,700
I don't even have the song queued up

2227
03:37:45,719 --> 03:37:53,719
The ball's dropping right now catboy germa playing to the crowd is the boss gonna drop like right now here it comes here it comes

2228
03:37:53,719 --> 03:38:00,370
Here it comes. Here it comes. Did andy mark just got eliminated. Oh, no the andy mark robot

2229
03:38:02,399 --> 03:38:04,399
The power of of a hundred asses

2230
03:38:04,959 --> 03:38:13,459
No gotcha red still in the fight and is it new year yet? Not yet. Not yet. Not yet about 35 seconds

2231
03:38:19,590 --> 03:38:22,809
One of these is going to be the winner of your 2020

2232
03:38:23,670 --> 03:38:29,479
Rumble, you understand one of these is your winner

2233
03:38:34,799 --> 03:38:40,579
Catboy germa trying to get seaman into the corner. No, he throws him right into gotcha red

2234
03:38:43,829 --> 03:38:45,510
five seconds

2235
03:38:45,510 --> 03:38:46,469
three

2236
03:38:46,469 --> 03:38:48,469
two one

2237
03:38:48,469 --> 03:38:59,729
Happy new year everybody

2238
03:38:59,809 --> 03:39:07,110
And the final contestant of the night is juggles the greatest streamer

2239
03:39:09,159 --> 03:39:11,159
Juggles the great is your final competitor

2240
03:39:15,969 --> 03:39:17,969
Looks like he's got a full belly

2241
03:39:18,209 --> 03:39:20,840
Sitting in his underwear

2242
03:39:20,840 --> 03:39:25,719
And who did catboy germa just eliminate? Who just got eliminated?

2243
03:39:27,959 --> 03:39:34,920
Seaman just got eliminated by catboy germa and goodbye catboy germa gotcha red with a major big elimination there

2244
03:39:37,680 --> 03:39:40,719
A high hope for catboy germa, but it didn't happen

2245
03:39:43,139 --> 03:39:44,799
Unfortunately

2246
03:39:44,799 --> 03:39:50,799
And juggles the great comes right in against a ddt and germa's dump truck is just like splitting that ass right on the turnbuckle

2247
03:39:50,799 --> 03:39:54,159
He don't care

2248
03:39:54,159 --> 03:39:58,799
nice twisting arm flexing smash glass breaking attack

2249
03:40:00,479 --> 03:40:05,600
Onto chuck e cheese as gotcha red juggles the great it's going to be shaking him up here over the top turnbuckle

2250
03:40:07,829 --> 03:40:10,309
No, I don't think he can do it. He's not strong enough

2251
03:40:12,739 --> 03:40:14,739
Not strong enough

2252
03:40:18,600 --> 03:40:21,719
Gotcha red is still holding on for dear life

2253
03:40:22,280 --> 03:40:24,280
And he still has pretty decent health

2254
03:40:25,110 --> 03:40:26,870
His health is pretty good

2255
03:40:26,870 --> 03:40:32,079
It's going to be really hard to eliminate gotcha force g red

2256
03:40:33,459 --> 03:40:36,340
Greatest game cube game ever made and it's also the most expensive

2257
03:40:37,059 --> 03:40:44,340
It's like three hundred dollars to buy that game goodbye beanbag sonic. That's it. That was such an opportunity

2258
03:40:44,340 --> 03:40:49,120
That's such a disappointment huge disappointment beanbag sonic is out

2259
03:40:52,870 --> 03:40:56,260
This looks like it's going to come down

2260
03:40:56,340 --> 03:40:57,299
to

2261
03:40:57,299 --> 03:41:03,090
g red and somebody

2262
03:41:03,090 --> 03:41:07,010
Juggles the great going for a big punch not enough to knock him down though chuck e cheese

2263
03:41:07,649 --> 03:41:09,829
Just overhead through

2264
03:41:10,069 --> 03:41:12,069
Wait, what he just did it twice

2265
03:41:12,930 --> 03:41:14,930
He just pulled him back yonked him back and did it again

2266
03:41:17,569 --> 03:41:26,739
Your final three competitors are chuck e cheese gotcha red and juggles the great this is anybody's fight here

2267
03:41:28,920 --> 03:41:30,719
Oh, no

2268
03:41:30,719 --> 03:41:38,639
Gotcha red with a big comeback. He's gonna dump him g red

2269
03:41:40,280 --> 03:41:43,639
Is he gonna just sit there and let him do it or is he gonna break it up? I don't know

2270
03:41:45,010 --> 03:41:47,649
No, he's it's not enough to dump chuck e cheese

2271
03:41:50,370 --> 03:41:59,110
Here it is being back sonic in the background. Here are your final three who could be crowned the 2020 champion of the 2020

2272
03:41:59,750 --> 03:42:06,420
Derma rumble chuck e cheese is gonna get dumped here and it's gonna be it's

2273
03:42:08,760 --> 03:42:13,239
No, is he gonna let him do it? Is chuck e cheese gonna fight back? Come on chuck e cheese

2274
03:42:13,959 --> 03:42:23,879
No, there goes chuck e cheese juggles the great and g red

2275
03:42:25,510 --> 03:42:29,590
Juggles the great is the last person to come in. Let's see if g red gets. Oh my god

2276
03:42:32,149 --> 03:42:34,549
I thought he was gonna throw him directly over the ropes

2277
03:42:36,290 --> 03:42:39,729
Did you see you see the momentum you see the excitement in that grab?

2278
03:42:46,399 --> 03:42:48,399
He's gonna prove to everybody once and for all

2279
03:42:50,040 --> 03:42:52,260
That this was worth streaming

2280
03:42:52,260 --> 03:42:56,530
And then it was a great game. Is he gonna do it?

2281
03:42:57,250 --> 03:43:06,260
Can he dump him? Can he dump juggles? Is g red going to win the rumble? No, it's not enough juggles with the reversal

2282
03:43:09,879 --> 03:43:12,120
Oh, no, he's getting slow

2283
03:43:12,120 --> 03:43:18,840
He's slowing down. It's gonna take a miracle big belly to belly suplex, but juggles is red, too

2284
03:43:19,680 --> 03:43:21,680
Uh-oh, he's going for the fucking belly shake

2285
03:43:25,000 --> 03:43:27,000
Or he's going for the human brick

2286
03:43:28,069 --> 03:43:40,719
Oh

2287
03:43:41,200 --> 03:43:45,600
That's three belly shakes three belly shakes in a row, but wait a minute

2288
03:43:46,420 --> 03:43:48,309
Wait a minute

2289
03:43:48,309 --> 03:43:50,420
he

2290
03:43:50,420 --> 03:43:52,020
He reversed it

2291
03:43:52,020 --> 03:43:55,799
huge clothesline

2292
03:43:55,879 --> 03:44:02,440
Gotcha red. He's got only two percent battery left on his fucking phone. Please plug it in for god's sakes. You're killing us

2293
03:44:04,049 --> 03:44:07,489
I'm sick of you sending me screenshots with four percent battery, dude, please

2294
03:44:08,290 --> 03:44:14,229
Could this be the end?

2295
03:44:14,229 --> 03:44:22,370
Big reversal by juggles. Oh, no. Oh, no. No. No. No, can he he's no

2296
03:44:23,489 --> 03:44:25,489
He's still holding on for dear life

2297
03:44:27,639 --> 03:44:30,840
G red has no hp left. He's just floating there

2298
03:44:31,969 --> 03:44:33,969
It's gonna happen. It's over

2299
03:44:34,370 --> 03:44:36,440
It's over

2300
03:44:36,440 --> 03:44:38,200
It's over

2301
03:44:38,200 --> 03:44:39,239
No

2302
03:44:39,239 --> 03:44:41,879
No, you can't let him do this to you g red. That's it

2303
03:44:43,090 --> 03:44:45,090
juggles number 30

2304
03:44:46,180 --> 03:44:48,180
Bastard comes in at the very end

2305
03:44:53,590 --> 03:45:03,079
Oh, I really thought he was gonna pull it off too bad too bad juggles the great is your 2020 germa rumble winner

2306
03:45:03,479 --> 03:45:10,690
I mean, you can't come back from three

2307
03:45:11,620 --> 03:45:17,219
Massive gatorade fold stomach frog splashes. It's not it's not gonna happen. It's just not gonna happen

2308
03:45:17,219 --> 03:45:26,809
You gotta be realistic juggles. The great, uh is your winner, unfortunately

2309
03:45:29,100 --> 03:45:31,200
Unfortunately, I really was rooting for gotcha red

2310
03:45:36,309 --> 03:45:38,309
I want the catboy germa timeline

2315
03:46:06,850 --> 03:46:12,719
I can't believe the mc teal the mc dlt briefcase guy. He got eliminated instantly

2316
03:46:13,040 --> 03:46:18,950

03:46:34,309 --> 03:46:40,840
Happy new year. Wait, it's just the same exact thing

2320
03:46:41,639 --> 03:46:49,010
Wait, it's not gonna do the same exact stuff, right? It's the same exact participants coming in

2321
03:46:55,299 --> 03:47:05,139
Yeah, we gotta shuffle this yeah, we gotta shuffle this so that we can't have the whole thing happen

2322
03:47:05,379 --> 03:47:13,040
All right. Give me a sec. What do you think should we add you want to add a couple of ritz brothers?

2323
03:47:13,280 --> 03:47:29,440
What do you think add add majima and kiro? Okay, we'll we'll yeah

2324
03:47:29,440 --> 03:47:40,079
We'll just just watch me do this. All right, so it doesn't really matter who comes in first

2325
03:47:40,159 --> 03:47:45,090
What do you think we'll add? I mean beanbag sonic you can do random. That's good

2326
03:47:46,639 --> 03:47:58,149
Participants, let's add everybody. Uh, if you add big banana, you see like this that's

2327
03:48:01,620 --> 03:48:13,719
Big banana go in. All right. This by the way, this is not the order. This is i'm just putting people in fortnight

2328
03:48:15,079 --> 03:48:17,959
Yeah, oh andy mark's already in it. Okay, let's go like this

2329
03:48:19,299 --> 03:48:24,950
Put the green screen in uh, the green screen is not in this game. Uh, this is i've got 2020

2330
03:48:24,950 --> 03:48:29,110
This is not 2018 anymore, which is kind of funny because 2018

2331
03:48:30,120 --> 03:48:38,399
Uh, it's probably like a better game. What about glue man? Yeah, i'll put him in

2332
03:48:42,440 --> 03:48:48,129
Just make him make him now leave roman reigns in

2333
03:48:48,690 --> 03:48:51,379
No, why?

2334
03:48:51,379 --> 03:48:54,979
Just make a big green guy. That's like has a hundred in all stats

2335
03:48:59,590 --> 03:49:08,309
Uh, jex is already in true. Let's put one of the ritz brothers in it. Let's put al ritz in it. Why not?

2336
03:49:11,430 --> 03:49:19,030
Please germa, please do it do it now. Where was he? Why was he not in the rumble? What?

2337
03:49:19,430 --> 03:49:25,170
I was wondering there are two or three people that were missing

2338
03:49:25,909 --> 03:49:44,239
Who else was missing from the rumble? Oh no longer counts. We didn't have all the competitors. Oh shit

2339
03:49:44,319 --> 03:49:53,809
All right, that's no that's accurate. I yeah, I was wondering like what way did what happened?

2340
03:49:53,809 --> 03:50:04,899
What happened to joel? I made joel and like put him in yeah, it's time for a rematch. I hope joel fucking wins now

2341
03:50:05,139 --> 03:50:09,809
oh, you know what it was it's probably because

2342
03:50:12,639 --> 03:50:18,709
Wink dink was not supposed to be in the rumble that was supposed to be joel because they already had their match

2343
03:50:19,030 --> 03:50:29,170
So yeah, that's what happened. All right, what do you obviously long drive dead? What about cat boy?

2344
03:50:29,170 --> 03:50:31,170
I know i'm getting to it. I'm getting to it

2345
03:50:41,399 --> 03:51:02,870
No roman reigns is not staying in over maxon gotta put the pencil in get gimli out gimli out

2346
03:51:02,950 --> 03:51:04,950

2348
03:51:20,420 --> 03:51:29,090

2349
03:51:29,329 --> 03:51:46,260
Now just you know, just remove me for gimli seriously dlt briefcase guys 100 and what about it?

2350
03:51:46,420 --> 03:51:51,360
But you don't think that he's like one of the strongest people here. What are you talking about?

2351
03:51:55,329 --> 03:51:59,239
Is that seriously a question that you're asking put germa back in?

2352
03:52:00,930 --> 03:52:10,450
Remove the writs brother. All right, fine. Take juggles out. He already won. That's a good idea. That's a good point

2353
03:52:12,290 --> 03:52:26,129

03:52:49,489 --> 03:52:56,149
No, I want to watch that fucker get snapped in two. Well, this is good. What about pac-man?

2357
03:52:57,989 --> 03:53:04,719
Uh, we can get rid of jigsaw. He he was shitty. He came in and got eliminated instantly

2358
03:53:04,799 --> 03:53:15,280
We'll put uh, we'll put max instead of jigsaw. I mean it's hard to do there are too many characters here. What about murius?

2359
03:53:16,440 --> 03:53:20,120

2370
03:55:04,420 --> 03:55:09,649
Here comes the redo. Well, not really redo more of a an encore

2371
03:55:15,350 --> 03:55:18,309
Jigsaw is going to have fun in it looks like mr

2372
03:55:18,309 --> 03:55:20,790
Green and germa thing are the first two contestants in the ring

2373
03:55:24,180 --> 03:55:29,459
And in all these wwe games, uh, if you're not in the last like 10 to 15 people

2374
03:55:30,260 --> 03:55:31,940
You're not going to win

2375
03:55:31,940 --> 03:55:37,559
So enjoy the time they have in here now because they're going to be gone in about two to three minutes

2376
03:55:38,040 --> 03:55:45,120
But that's mr green and that's germa thing

2377
03:55:45,120 --> 03:55:52,280
No green screen. Well, look at he's green just imagine he was the green screen. It's usually one of the last four

2378
03:55:54,079 --> 03:55:56,340
Yeah, usually

2379
03:55:56,340 --> 03:56:03,399
Andy mark robot andy mark goat again. These are the these are the guys that did the carnival stuff

2380
03:56:03,799 --> 03:56:06,360
They made all the carnival robots, which were incredible

2381
03:56:06,920 --> 03:56:13,510
Everybody loves andy mark trying to get rid of mr. Green and they do

2382
03:56:18,629 --> 03:56:19,590
Nobody fucks with mr

2383
03:56:19,590 --> 03:56:20,629
Green

2384
03:56:20,629 --> 03:56:27,190
Unless it's multiple people fucking with mr. Green and he gets thrown. God damn it. I want him in like the final 10

2385
03:56:29,440 --> 03:56:31,440
How do I give him like extra points?

2386
03:56:32,719 --> 03:56:39,680
The mcdlt briefcase guy is in at number four

2387
03:56:43,079 --> 03:56:46,280
I mean, they all have good stats. The only one that didn't have good stats was um

2388
03:56:46,920 --> 03:56:56,149
Like fortnight jimmy has like under 70. I think he's the only person a hundred stats

2389
03:56:57,809 --> 03:57:02,930
No, he doesn't have a hundred staff dave newell at number five

2390
03:57:06,120 --> 03:57:08,040
You should play long drive

2391
03:57:08,040 --> 03:57:10,239
again

2392
03:57:10,239 --> 03:57:14,280
Who had the most eliminations like cheers to you?

2393
03:57:14,920 --> 03:57:26,600
Cheers to you eliminated at least three or four people at least ice ddt under the ropes

2394
03:57:27,520 --> 03:57:29,520
By the mcdlt briefcase guy

2395
03:57:32,959 --> 03:57:37,600
Long drive too. Well, I mean I kind of have to it won best stream of the year, but that's kind of scary

2396
03:57:38,239 --> 03:57:41,940
Because what if you guys thought it was so good? What if the sequel is not good enough?

2397
03:57:42,420 --> 03:57:46,469
What if I play that game again and stream it and it's just i'm just not it's not as funny

2398
03:57:46,950 --> 03:57:51,219
It's going to get multiplayer soon. Oh shit. Nice

2399
03:57:52,870 --> 03:57:54,309
What the hell was that?

2400
03:57:54,309 --> 03:57:59,879
Yeah, I feel like lightning struck. I don't know if lightning can strike twice

2401
03:58:00,440 --> 03:58:08,079
Uh gabe newell going for an elimination here on andy mark

2402
03:58:10,500 --> 03:58:12,500
Germa thing getting involved

2403
03:58:13,350 --> 03:58:15,590
And there's the dump. See you later andy mark

2404
03:58:16,469 --> 03:58:19,829
And pac-man by the mcdlt briefcase guy g red coming in

2405
03:58:24,709 --> 03:58:28,469
g red making the appearance for the second time almost won the

2406
03:58:29,559 --> 03:58:36,280
Quote unquote official one, but we can have more than one. They can be two official winners, right?

2407
03:58:38,389 --> 03:58:42,819
Big power bomb that was huge pac-man got ghosted

2408
03:58:48,079 --> 03:58:54,319
Yeah, he was gone instantly, huh bf bugleberry at number eight

2409
03:59:00,440 --> 03:59:06,520
You know, i'd really love to see gabe newell win. I really would he was in all the original ones

2410
03:59:09,829 --> 03:59:13,350
He always got so close. I'd love to see a gabe newell victory here

2411
03:59:17,510 --> 03:59:19,510
Or how or a catboy one?

2412
03:59:20,229 --> 03:59:24,280
I would love to see a germa catboy rumble victory

2413
03:59:34,049 --> 03:59:35,889
Catboy

2414
03:59:35,889 --> 03:59:41,569
Big suplex from gabe newell on to germa thing as chuck e cheese coming up at almost number 10

2415
03:59:41,969 --> 03:59:53,059
Hey, there was also a pretty equal chance that chuck e cheese was gonna win too. So why you tell me what's worse? And there he goes

2416
03:59:53,940 --> 04:00:00,180
There he's gone and my favorite characters get a fucking hundred in every step. That's how you know that it doesn't matter

2417
04:00:00,979 --> 04:00:04,040
He has almost 100 in every step

2418
04:00:04,680 --> 04:00:08,069
Are they gonna dump gabe newell?

2419
04:00:08,389 --> 04:00:10,760
Uh, what's the worst outcome?

2420
04:00:10,760 --> 04:00:12,450
chuck e cheese or

2421
04:00:12,450 --> 04:00:15,079
Is chuck e cheese almost won?

2422
04:00:15,079 --> 04:00:17,620
There goes max

2423
04:00:17,620 --> 04:00:22,610
Catboy is the worst outcome

2424
04:00:22,610 --> 04:00:23,809
The worst outcome

2425
04:00:23,809 --> 04:00:29,489
Every time this ticks up and it's not catboy is a higher chance at a catboy rumble victory

2426
04:00:31,239 --> 04:00:33,639
Or even a bf bugleberry victory because look he's still there

2427
04:00:42,069 --> 04:00:44,069
Chuck e cheese on the ropes max

2428
04:00:46,719 --> 04:00:48,719
I love max max looks so funny

2429
04:00:49,120 --> 04:00:51,809
Germa thing looks really funny, too

04:00:53,700 --> 04:00:57,379
Germa 985 in his full body cast. Come on out. Let's see what you can do

2431
04:01:01,350 --> 04:01:03,350

2436
04:01:29,409 --> 04:01:30,850

Just hammering on the back of chuck e cheese right in his spine

04:02:03,170 --> 04:02:05,170

2444
04:02:20,399 --> 04:02:25,010

Why are they lying on top of each other?

2448
04:02:44,389 --> 04:02:46,389
Why are they all lined up together?

2449
04:02:47,350 --> 04:02:49,350
They're lying down like sardines

2450
04:02:57,430 --> 04:02:59,430
Long drive dad coming in

2451
04:03:00,069 --> 04:03:03,190
Takes a headbutt from the biggest mouse i've ever seen

2452
04:03:07,329 --> 04:03:12,930
Everybody's favorite character is about to go buy chuck e cheese, of course instantly or gabe newell, which everybody likes gabe newell

2453
04:03:14,549 --> 04:03:16,549
Chuck e cheese you maniac

2454
04:03:19,280 --> 04:03:25,719
Absolute maniac the f bugler with a sliding tackle

2455
04:03:27,639 --> 04:03:29,959
The name drew crew is better than catboy crew

2456
04:03:30,760 --> 04:03:32,610
um

2457
04:03:32,610 --> 04:03:34,610
That's a debate that you guys can have here

2458
04:03:40,610 --> 04:03:41,809
Yeah

2459
04:03:41,809 --> 04:03:44,180
Bugleberry going on the top rope

2460
04:03:44,579 --> 04:03:46,260
What is he going for?

2461
04:03:46,260 --> 04:03:49,059
Oh my god, and I was right in my chest really

2462
04:03:50,200 --> 04:03:52,629
Really bugleberry

2463
04:03:52,629 --> 04:03:54,629
You're gonna like you're gonna kick a man when he's down

2464
04:03:55,809 --> 04:03:58,290
Really?

2465
04:03:58,290 --> 04:04:00,290
Get him out throw him out of here

2466
04:04:02,020 --> 04:04:05,379
Oh

2467
04:04:05,379 --> 04:04:07,540
He felt my anger he could feel it

2468
04:04:10,790 --> 04:04:12,389
German 985

2469
04:04:12,389 --> 04:04:15,200
Letting the adrenaline take over

2470
04:04:15,280 --> 04:04:18,690
Little does everybody know that after this adrenaline wears off

2471
04:04:18,690 --> 04:04:20,690
He's gonna be off for about three and a half months

2472
04:04:21,409 --> 04:04:26,209
But at least he might be able to pull the victory

2473
04:04:26,370 --> 04:04:31,760
Is uh, dr smugson going down what just happened to gabe newell?

2474
04:04:32,399 --> 04:04:36,870
Is that a punch or is it a

2475
04:04:37,909 --> 04:04:40,709
He's just punching him in the face over and over again

2476
04:04:41,350 --> 04:04:43,649
Can I get rid of chuck e cheese too?

2477
04:04:43,809 --> 04:04:46,209

04:05:26,200 --> 04:05:28,739
You're kidding me

2486
04:05:28,739 --> 04:05:32,450
Why is it just standing there?

2487
04:05:32,850 --> 04:05:34,450
Oh shit

2488
04:05:34,450 --> 04:05:39,409
Gabe newell has been eliminated by a huge lariat by long drive down and here comes joe

2489
04:05:40,370 --> 04:05:44,100

Big elimination on g red first time we've seen a crossover here on this channel representing vine wrestle joel

2491
04:05:59,329 --> 04:06:04,639
Vine sauce joel

Big slap by germa thing onto joel

2497
04:06:27,479 --> 04:06:29,799
He's looking for a place to dump me. That's what this is

2498
04:06:34,629 --> 04:06:35,989
Oh, no

2499
04:06:35,989 --> 04:06:38,469
No, no, don't let the doctor eliminate you

2500
04:06:42,629 --> 04:06:46,229
No one's throwing me out man. I'm staying in this for a long time big stunner

2501
04:06:50,879 --> 04:06:56,239
Can't capitalize but they cannot follow up with it and then pasta taliano coming in

2502
04:06:58,639 --> 04:07:00,639
Chef from that delicious fine establishment

2503
04:07:04,709 --> 04:07:06,709
Just flipped up like a pancake

2504
04:07:14,659 --> 04:07:19,139
Juggles coming in if juggles is 30 again. I'm gonna be pissed. I'm gonna be so mad

2505
04:07:22,049 --> 04:07:25,569
Murius the cow from the drew crew. I mean the moo crew dome. What happened?

Why was that like times two speed? That was weird

2508
04:07:33,360 --> 04:07:35,700
Joel just got eliminated by dr smugson

2509
04:07:38,850 --> 04:07:40,760
to a thing

2510
04:07:40,760 --> 04:07:42,760
With another attempt on long drive dad

2511
04:07:44,399 --> 04:07:46,399
Uh, well, thank you joel for joining us

2512
04:07:49,270 --> 04:07:51,270
At the germa rumble 2020

2513
04:07:58,950 --> 04:08:02,629
Bean bag sonic coming in next i thought joel i thought joel was gonna be in it for a while

2514
04:08:08,399 --> 04:08:11,600
i'm surprised

2515
04:08:11,600 --> 04:08:13,600
Can't like stick him with those horns

2516
04:08:14,819 --> 04:08:16,819
Dr smugson completely misses

2517
04:08:17,479 --> 04:08:23,270
Completely. I don't even know what he was punching but and now he's in trouble being back sonic in a good spot by the way

2518
04:08:23,270 --> 04:08:24,469
Coming in

2519
04:08:24,469 --> 04:08:26,469
um, okay

2520
04:08:26,870 --> 04:08:28,870
Okay, goodbye

2521
04:08:30,149 --> 04:08:32,149
He just ran

2522
04:08:32,309 --> 04:08:34,309
Pasta taliano is gone

2523
04:08:38,530 --> 04:08:43,010
You threw him so hard that he is continuing to run by himself on his own

2524
04:08:44,129 --> 04:08:46,559
Jesus

2525
04:08:46,559 --> 04:08:49,920
Bean bag sonic absolutely crushing it right now eliminates

2526
04:08:51,110 --> 04:08:52,549
two people in a row

2527
04:08:52,549 --> 04:08:57,639
There goes germa 985

2528
04:08:57,639 --> 04:09:00,659
eliminated

2529
04:09:00,659 --> 04:09:04,659
Four fan favorites are in the ring right now. Just want to make that clear

2530
04:09:11,569 --> 04:09:14,690
There goes long drive dad and in comes glue man at number 18

2531
04:09:18,770 --> 04:09:22,770
Is this the opportunity for glue man to at least get a win here? Is this the opportunity?

2532
04:09:26,260 --> 04:09:35,440
So far not so good

2533
04:09:35,440 --> 04:09:37,920
This is the spot you want to be and it's going to be one of these people here

2534
04:09:38,559 --> 04:09:43,639
All right, you know what? All right, here you go. I think a bean bag sonic's gonna win this I think

2535
04:09:46,950 --> 04:09:50,229
Really good position just kind of just beat up the horse the cow

2536
04:09:52,229 --> 04:09:56,389
Travis touchdown is number 19 still no sign of germa cat boy

2537
04:09:58,280 --> 04:09:59,239
which

2538
04:09:59,239 --> 04:10:01,670
I think is concerning a lot of you

2539
04:10:07,059 --> 04:10:12,049
By the way, anybody see travis touchdowns shirt get a good look right now

2540

Anybody know what that is?

2541

That is cat boy germa on that shirt. Yes, you are right

2542
04:10:29,989 --> 04:10:32,149
Here comes majima number 20 good place to be in

2543
04:10:35,299 --> 04:10:40,420
Germa thing is gone

2544
04:10:40,420 --> 04:10:44,979
Big right hands by murius onto bean bag sonic looks like majima's gonna finish the job with some shin kicks

2545
04:10:46,420 --> 04:10:48,979
No, he's gonna get from behind glue man

2546
04:10:49,860 --> 04:10:53,020
He's gonna keep just punching him over and over and over again in the corner

2547
04:10:53,979 --> 04:11:00,739
What did you do

2548
04:11:08,329 --> 04:11:12,250
Big but

2549
04:11:12,250 --> 04:11:14,549
He's I can't even talk

2550
04:11:17,479 --> 04:11:21,000
He jumped over him and went way too high and flew over the ring

2551
04:11:25,420 --> 04:11:28,079
There goes travis touchdown majima with elimination

2552
04:11:30,100 --> 04:11:32,100
Uh, but big big banana bro

2553
04:11:33,799 --> 04:11:36,739

2554
04:11:36,739 --> 04:11:40,569
blue man, though

2555
04:11:40,569 --> 04:11:42,809
glue man's ear glue man's ear it could be

2556
04:11:43,979 --> 04:11:49,020
Jax is coming in at 22 nice backflip by majima. Holy shit. Did you see that? That was unbelievable

2557
04:11:52,569 --> 04:11:56,040
We got jex though

04:11:58,680 --> 04:12:02,389
Did he fall down on the way in here?

2560
04:12:09,110 --> 04:12:11,350
Big banana bro looks like he's gonna be throwing up majima

2561
04:12:13,209 --> 04:12:15,209
No, they both want to get rid of majima

04:12:31,139 --> 04:12:39,340
A jar of mayonnaise coming in

Catboy germa at number 25. It's possible

2578
04:13:40,709 --> 04:13:43,909
It's possible for a catboy cannon win

2579
04:13:50,979 --> 04:13:54,979
Too early. I don't know. It could it could whoever comes in over the next five

2580
04:13:55,620 --> 04:14:01,530

2586
04:14:26,309 --> 04:14:28,389
There goes jex eliminated by glue man

2587
04:14:30,520 --> 04:14:35,000
Blue man's year could be this year. He could win at least one and even if it's the encore

2588
04:14:40,340 --> 04:14:43,700
Stop the catboy anything but catboys stop the catboy

2589
04:14:45,420 --> 04:14:49,020
I don't know. We'll see we'll see. Uh-oh fortnight jimmy's in trouble

2590
04:14:50,549 --> 04:14:56,280
He's gonna get tossed over by germa catboy. Look at the health on catboy germa, by the way

Jara mayne still can't get eliminated even with two people trying to push him down

2593
04:15:10,219 --> 04:15:17,379
Holy shit, that was brutal

Uh, yeah glue man's are gonna turn to the undertaker

2605
04:16:11,899 --> 04:16:15,750
He's gonna get to be like 74 years old

2606
04:16:16,309 --> 04:16:20,659
And still be wrestling

2607
04:16:20,659 --> 04:16:22,739
But the difference is the undertaker won

2608
04:16:23,459 --> 04:16:26,360
WrestleMania like 30 times glue man has done nothing

2609
04:16:27,719 --> 04:16:32,780

2613
04:16:57,350 --> 04:17:08,860
Nancy drew coming into 28. We've got two different crew. This is crew matchup rematch again

2614
04:17:09,020 --> 04:17:17,299
Oh

2615
04:17:17,299 --> 04:17:19,139
I really wanted mayo to win

2616
04:17:19,139 --> 04:17:21,780
If I had to pick somebody in this ring, it'd be mayo or glue man

2617
04:17:22,340 --> 04:17:23,780
Or nancy drew

2618
04:17:23,780 --> 04:17:33,260
I've seen a lot of banana bros people looking for the banana bro to win. It's possible. He's got pretty good health. Maybe he doesn't

2619
04:17:36,250 --> 04:17:40,010
Germa's dump truck ass is coming in here at number 29

2620
04:17:40,729 --> 04:17:42,889
So who's 30 who've we not seen yet?

Of just memes right now

2626
04:18:10,020 --> 04:18:12,739
If I had to put a bet down, I'd I would put it right now on

2627
04:18:14,329 --> 04:18:16,569
Um, well wait, I'll wait for the last one

2628
04:18:21,829 --> 04:18:24,389
I don't think it's gonna be glue man. He's been in here for too long. Look at his health

2629
04:18:25,780 --> 04:18:27,379
It's gonna be dump truck

2630
04:18:27,379 --> 04:18:32,090
Just watch or nancy drew

2631
04:18:32,090 --> 04:18:34,090

Banana broke gone

2634
04:18:43,909 --> 04:18:49,430
Final competitor is c man at number 30. Here is one of your winners in the ring right now

2635
04:18:50,069 --> 04:18:52,069
Cheers to ucd glue man

2636
04:18:52,389 --> 04:18:56,870
Germa dump truck nancy drew forget about glue man. It's not your year. It never is

2637
04:18:59,620 --> 04:19:03,540
One of these will be crowned catboy. Germa has been eliminated by fortnight jimmy

2638
04:19:06,469 --> 04:19:08,469
Jimmy has gone nuts

2639
04:19:15,909 --> 04:19:19,750
I actually I think I might change my vote here. I think i'll put it on fortnight jimmy

2640
04:19:23,590 --> 04:19:25,590
Beanbag sonic didn't eliminate himself

2641
04:19:28,219 --> 04:19:34,309
Come on

2642
04:19:34,309 --> 04:19:35,750
All right

2643
04:19:35,750 --> 04:19:37,750
I think it could I think it's gonna be nancy drew

2644
04:19:40,569 --> 04:19:43,049
Dump truck c man cheers to you murius

2645
04:19:47,190 --> 04:19:49,190
One of these will be the other winner

2646
04:19:51,239 --> 04:19:56,520
C man wins then that that's stupid and he just comes in at 30 nancy drew cannot let that happen

2647
04:20:01,510 --> 04:20:03,510
Oh, no, okay

2648
04:20:06,780 --> 04:20:09,079
Get rid of c man

2649
04:20:09,079 --> 04:20:11,399
Get rid of c man. There you go work together

2650
04:20:14,520 --> 04:20:17,219

04:20:17,219 --> 04:20:20,899
What are you doing?

2652
04:20:20,899 --> 04:20:23,459
He's got the most health. Well dump truck actually has a lot of health

2653
04:20:25,379 --> 04:20:26,819
Holy shit

2654
04:20:26,819 --> 04:20:28,579
He just completely

2655
04:20:28,659 --> 04:20:32,260
He completely took him off guard. He wasn't even ready. He wasn't even ready

2656
04:20:33,459 --> 04:20:37,559
Oh my god

2657
04:20:38,200 --> 04:20:42,360
Oh, no

2658
04:20:42,360 --> 04:20:45,159
Nancy drew and dump truck are the last two

2659
04:20:47,239 --> 04:20:49,239
Who will win the encore?

2660
04:20:52,469 --> 04:20:55,989
I got my money on nancy drew. It's gonna be nancy drew. This is it

2661
04:20:56,629 --> 04:20:59,750
This is gonna be the end. She's gonna dump him. She's gonna dump him over. It's over

2662
04:21:00,649 --> 04:21:01,690
That's it

2663
04:21:01,690 --> 04:21:05,430
Nancy drew is your winner

2664
04:21:05,430 --> 04:21:07,430
of the 2020 encore rumble

2665
04:21:09,819 --> 04:21:19,030
Nancy drew is your winner

2666
04:21:22,579 --> 04:21:31,209
Dumped the truck now. It's nancy versus juggles for the real winner. It sounds like a good idea to me

2667
04:21:31,770 --> 04:21:38,290
What are the rules?

2668
04:21:38,290 --> 04:21:43,940
Congratulations. Uh, congratulations nancy drew put him in a cage

04:21:54,100 --> 04:22:01,530
Hell in a cell, okay

2671
04:22:01,530 --> 04:22:31,590
Put him in a hell in a cell nancy drew coming in versus uh juggles nancy drew seems to have the advantage

2672
04:22:31,909 --> 04:22:43,510
Select arena sure why not run down high school gym here comes the person

Victor the real champion of germa rumble 2020 our predictions live right now. They are this is a big one

No, we're not doing big head mode. You went all in. All right, do big head mode do it

2677
04:23:27,659 --> 04:23:36,569
We can't do big head mode. Not right now. No big head mode. No, this is the championship

2678
04:23:39,969 --> 04:23:48,569
36 million on who what do you get you get? This is a major major difference here

Of the 2020 rumble nancy drew or juggles the great

2683
04:24:40,040 --> 04:24:42,620
main event

2684
04:24:42,620 --> 04:24:44,940
hell in a cell in a random rundown high school

2685
04:24:45,899 --> 04:24:58,000
Nice start by nancy drew didn't even wait a second kind of hard to see through this cage though underdog

2686
04:25:00,780 --> 04:25:02,059
Uh-oh

2687
04:25:02,059 --> 04:25:04,819
How do you win a hell in a cell you have to pin right?

2688
04:25:09,959 --> 04:25:14,840
I would laugh so hard. That was it. I would fucking shit my pants if that was seriously how it ended

2689
04:25:15,940 --> 04:25:20,979
Oh man, nancy drew even has better stats. It doesn't matter. Sometimes momentum is all that matters

2690
04:25:25,909 --> 04:25:27,909
There we go. Nice reversal

2691
04:25:29,379 --> 04:25:33,899
Switching it up a little bit here

2692
04:25:33,979 --> 04:25:40,020
What?

2693
04:25:40,020 --> 04:25:42,020
The silence is deafening

2694
04:25:42,260 --> 04:25:48,729
Yeah, it's just like, you know, these two people are kind of just throwing kind of just moving their bodies around and like landing on their backs

2695
04:25:57,430 --> 04:25:59,430
Health is not that big of a deal though

2696
04:25:59,430 --> 04:26:01,030
This is depressing

2697
04:26:01,030 --> 04:26:03,379
Quite the main event

2698
04:26:03,379 --> 04:26:05,379
Yeah, let's go

2699
04:26:05,540 --> 04:26:09,579
Get him

2700
04:26:14,659 --> 04:26:18,870
Why is there even a referee in here? Why is there a referee in here?

2701
04:26:19,270 --> 04:26:26,520
The fuck

2702
04:26:26,520 --> 04:26:28,360
That would not even hurt

2703
04:26:28,360 --> 04:26:30,600
You just landed on your back while holding his legs

2704
04:26:36,489 --> 04:26:38,489
Going for the pin. Is it possible?

2705
04:26:40,020 --> 04:26:41,540
Will they use the cage?

2706
04:26:41,540 --> 04:26:43,780
Somebody get up on top of the cage

2707
04:26:52,459 --> 04:26:53,819
oof

2708
04:26:53,819 --> 04:26:55,819
Get on top of the cage somebody climb the cage

2709
04:27:04,540 --> 04:27:07,180
It really is so depressing without like fans and

2710
04:27:08,139 --> 04:27:09,159
like

2711
04:27:09,159 --> 04:27:16,420
sounds besides

2712
04:27:16,420 --> 04:27:19,459
On the undertale ost. I think this is it for nancy drew by the way

2713
04:27:20,739 --> 04:27:23,219
This is it

2714
04:27:23,219 --> 04:27:25,989
Yeah, that's it. It's laughing the belly

2715
04:27:27,239 --> 04:27:34,899
You know cc's victory juggles has the momentum though

2716
04:27:36,040 --> 04:27:37,750
That could be it

2717
04:27:37,750 --> 04:27:44,459
One no one count. She just did the undertaker recovery

2718
04:27:45,020 --> 04:27:48,149
Come on nancy

2719
04:27:48,149 --> 04:27:50,920
into the cell

2720
04:27:50,920 --> 04:27:52,920
Not I guess not strong enough to knock him. Oh

2721
04:27:57,260 --> 04:27:58,840
Oh

2722
04:27:58,840 --> 04:28:00,680
Oh

2723
04:28:00,680 --> 04:28:01,959
Not good

2724
04:28:01,959 --> 04:28:08,739
Not good for nancy drew

2725
04:28:08,819 --> 04:28:12,899
What are you doing?

2726
04:28:14,860 --> 04:28:19,020
It can't be how it ends

2727
04:28:19,340 --> 04:28:25,860
Oh, this is so dumb nancy fight back

2728
04:28:28,059 --> 04:28:30,579
Fight back nancy

2729
04:28:30,579 --> 04:28:33,270
fight back

2730
04:28:33,270 --> 04:28:35,510
No, that's it

2731
04:28:40,600 --> 04:28:44,040
Juggles the great ends up winning and ends up taking the crown

2732
04:28:45,159 --> 04:28:48,200
Or actual germa rumble 2020 winner

2733
04:28:54,280 --> 04:28:58,200
Oh that what an upset 70% of you guys got it wrong

2734
04:29:02,100 --> 04:29:04,100
That's it

2735
04:29:04,940 --> 04:29:06,940
That was like the weird dog crawl

2736
04:29:08,600 --> 04:29:14,709
He is a superstar juggles the great congratulations

2737
04:29:18,700 --> 04:29:21,739
Oh, man

2738
04:29:21,739 --> 04:29:24,379
Do a best out of three. No, no, no best out of three

2739
04:29:30,420 --> 04:29:33,219
Worst character what juggles is a great character

2740
04:29:36,420 --> 04:29:38,899
How about super juggles versus super nancy drew?

2741
04:29:40,420 --> 04:29:51,159
No, I want to talk about this for just a second

2742
04:29:52,200 --> 04:29:53,879
so you probably noticed

2743
04:29:53,879 --> 04:29:55,639
that the

2744
04:29:55,639 --> 04:29:59,559
Awards this year. There was a lot more categories to put uh nominations in

2745
04:30:00,600 --> 04:30:02,760
But you didn't see a bunch of those categories

2746
04:30:04,100 --> 04:30:09,139
It was like another eight or nine categories that uh were not added to this particular stream

2747
04:30:09,780 --> 04:30:11,459
and the reason why

2748
04:30:11,459 --> 04:30:12,579
is

2749
04:30:12,579 --> 04:30:14,579
It was gonna be like too much to do

2750
04:30:14,659 --> 04:30:21,049
I didn't want to put a bunch of that on the editor and editors to make like 30 plus videos. So what we're gonna do

2751
04:30:21,690 --> 04:30:26,899
Is stalling but uh, i'm describing what we're gonna do

2752
04:30:27,459 --> 04:30:32,299
We're gonna do an encore awards night that are the sort of extra

2753
04:30:33,020 --> 04:30:40,649
Categories that's probably not gonna happen for a little while because I want people to be able to vote on it

2754
04:30:41,829 --> 04:30:45,670
So I would assume probably in the next like week or two. We'll do a sort of like little encore

2755
04:30:46,389 --> 04:30:53,139
For like an hour or so and we'll just do the other ones not like as flashy or anything

2756
04:30:53,860 --> 04:30:57,219
We might not even need videos for it. It'll be just fun to kind of look at it though

2757
04:30:57,780 --> 04:31:04,360
We'll see give us back our points

2758
04:31:12,149 --> 04:31:14,149
Give us back the points

2759
04:31:15,940 --> 04:31:17,940
I kind of like the idea. Hold on. Let's do

2760
04:31:20,889 --> 04:31:22,010
Let me see

2761
04:31:22,010 --> 04:31:28,120
I kind of want to I want to see someone so you can do like a custom match

2762
04:31:29,420 --> 04:31:37,700
Oh, wait, and he can't didn't they add something?

2763
04:31:38,809 --> 04:31:48,889
No, I want to do a table match. Who's like the strongest in here. I want to do a no not fortnight jimmy

2764
04:31:48,889 --> 04:31:57,110
No, no, no, we're getting away from fortnight jimmy. Well, you want catboy germa versus me? Okay, we'll do that

2765
04:31:59,500 --> 04:32:01,979
Catboy germa versus germa nine eight five

2766
04:32:03,219 --> 04:32:10,420
Oh, no, no, no against mcdlt. That's a good idea 100 fucking stats

2767
04:32:11,879 --> 04:32:24,069
Okay, so no against me die, but mcdlt is my favorite character fine fine fine fine fine fine fine

2768
04:32:24,469 --> 04:32:32,440
Look, i'm so terrible. I'm still gonna win

2769
04:32:43,219 --> 04:32:45,219
Catboy germa in all capitals by the way

2770
04:32:51,700 --> 04:32:53,370
Bets

2771
04:32:53,370 --> 04:33:02,010
You want to do bets? Let's go go for it. Let's do another prediction catboy germa versus germa nine eight five

2772
04:33:05,099 --> 04:33:13,240
I mean you saw the stats. This is going to be an absolute shit show. I lost everything

2773
04:33:14,119 --> 04:33:15,560
No

2774
04:33:15,560 --> 04:33:20,099
You lost everything

2775
04:33:27,939 --> 04:33:31,459
With nancy drew we said that with nancy drew. That's right. I could just come back here

2776
04:33:31,459 --> 04:33:33,459
And by the way, it's if you get broken through a table

2777
04:33:34,009 --> 04:33:38,540
You just have to go through the table. There's no pinning to whoever goes through it first

2778
04:33:44,479 --> 04:33:48,869
2021

2779
04:33:48,869 --> 04:33:51,909
Yeah, we were in the middle of the rumble, but happy new year guys

2780
04:33:53,299 --> 04:33:56,060
I know that this year has like sucked

2781
04:33:56,060 --> 04:34:01,849
For many reasons. Let's really hope that 2021 is better

2782
04:34:03,159 --> 04:34:05,159
Let's put it off to a good start. You know what I mean?

2783
04:34:06,409 --> 04:34:21,419
Because shit was rough was really rough in 2020 catboy germa is gonna win every time

2784
04:34:23,080 --> 04:34:26,279
You have to you have to cosplay as catboy germa if he wins

Oh, hold on a second there. Wait a minute. Let's make this interesting. Why don't we make this interesting?

2790
04:34:50,380 --> 04:34:56,869

If catboy germa wins, I will dress up like a catboy if germa 985 wins

Bang bang bang bang bang. I win. I win. I win. I win. I win

2848
04:40:17,319 --> 04:40:19,319
That's one billion dollars

2849
04:40:20,840 --> 04:40:23,159
Ooh, and I I put a lot up for that one

2850
04:40:30,970 --> 04:40:36,060
I put a lot up. I was gonna dress up like germa catboy on stream the entire thing

2851
04:40:36,779 --> 04:40:46,919
The whole thing double or nothing. Wait a minute. Wait a minute double or nothing. What do you mean?

2852
04:40:47,240 --> 04:41:08,330
How does that work two billion off the debt or I have to stream two days in a row as germa catboy catboy for a year

2853
04:41:08,490 --> 04:41:13,529
That's not happening. It's not worth it. No, i'm not doing it. It's not worth it. I know

2854
04:41:14,009 --> 04:41:20,139
No, i'm sorry. I just I just tapped you a little bit. I'm not doing that. I know when to stop. That's it shave it off

2855
04:41:22,169 --> 04:41:39,259
Not doing that's too nope I win so many 50 million points. Oh my god double or nothing to wipe the whole thing

2856
04:41:40,150 --> 04:41:42,150
Oh, I don't know about that

2857
04:41:46,619 --> 04:41:49,180
Are you kidding me?

2858
04:41:49,180 --> 04:41:59,340
To wipe the whole thing the debt is clear if I win here. Can I call in a wild card?

2859
04:41:59,419 --> 04:42:02,619
Does it have to be germa 985 but can I call in a can I phone a friend here?

2860
04:42:02,860 --> 04:42:41,689
No, it has to be me. This is for all the marvels right here. It's it's me

2861
04:42:41,770 --> 04:42:56,380
It is me go and it has to be this high school arena. No deal. No deal. What do you mean? No deal

2862
04:42:56,619 --> 04:43:02,330
We're gonna have to pull this. Okay. All right. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. We'll pull it

2863
04:43:02,490 --> 04:43:18,220
Remember, this is two catboy streams in a row back to back. So this is so this

2864
04:43:18,860 --> 04:43:30,520
It's just is this deal or no deal. This is if I win the debt is cleared if I lose

2865
04:43:30,919 --> 04:43:45,509
I have to be germa catboy for two days straight. Let's go. Let's see what the people want. Okay

2866
04:43:46,740 --> 04:43:52,090
This is looking pretty unanimous. This is looking pretty unanimous to me

2867
04:43:59,860 --> 04:44:02,419
Either we put an end to the debt arc or we win

2868
04:44:04,459 --> 04:44:07,500
It's true

2869
04:44:07,500 --> 04:44:09,900
2020 we could put a close on it right now or

2870
04:44:10,540 --> 04:44:13,500
It might bleed into 2021 and I have to dress up as a cat person

2871
04:44:17,529 --> 04:44:29,220
Uh, I don't think you guys really lose here. It is set in stone is the deal is the deal

2872
04:44:29,779 --> 04:44:32,069
That's it

2873
04:44:32,069 --> 04:44:34,229
67 of the vote. It's over

2874
04:44:34,229 --> 04:44:39,349
This is either all in this is either two streams in a row. Okay, let's go

2875
04:44:43,659 --> 04:44:59,220
Go go predictions. Oh, I I didn't know we were doing predictions for this one careful on your betting

2876
04:45:06,569 --> 04:45:08,569
Fuck okay right at the bat. Not good

2877
04:45:08,970 --> 04:45:14,709
Let's go get a weapon. Just go it's an extreme rules match go get a knife and just start stabbing catboy

2878
04:45:15,509 --> 04:45:20,490

2879
04:45:22,229 --> 04:45:24,229
Oh my god, it can't end like this

2880
04:45:24,709 --> 04:45:27,430
Go get a weapon. You can take the health down very quickly

2881
04:45:27,990 --> 04:45:30,869
reversal

2882
04:45:30,869 --> 04:45:32,869
Oh fucking jesus

2883
04:45:35,270 --> 04:45:38,220

04:45:38,220 --> 04:45:40,220
Up up up up. Come on momentum

2885
04:45:40,540 --> 04:45:42,119
momentum

2886
04:45:42,119 --> 04:45:45,319
You idiot. Oh my god had you missed was point blank punch

2887
04:45:46,119 --> 04:45:51,619
You missed a point blank punch

2888
04:45:51,619 --> 04:45:53,959
Don't do a flashy move off the top turnbuckle

2889
04:45:54,819 --> 04:45:56,419
That's not going to do anything

2890
04:45:56,419 --> 04:45:58,819
You're not going to have time to do this. They're going to reverse it

2891
04:46:02,040 --> 04:46:08,819
It's pretty big deal though. That was a big move go get a weapon

2892
04:46:12,790 --> 04:46:14,790
So much riding on this

2893
04:46:15,189 --> 04:46:19,220
This might be the biggest bet of my online career

2894
04:46:19,779 --> 04:46:25,349
What are we doing?

2895
04:46:25,349 --> 04:46:27,750
Yeah, the cat boy's health is not going down

2896
04:46:27,830 --> 04:46:33,799
Um

2897
04:46:33,799 --> 04:46:35,319

2898
04:46:35,319 --> 04:46:37,560

2908
04:47:44,009 --> 04:47:45,849
Get the bat hit

2909
04:47:45,849 --> 04:47:47,849
No, please do not hit him

2910
04:47:48,009 --> 04:47:51,430

That was a pretty good comedy routine. It's still anybody's game right now

2915
04:48:15,799 --> 04:48:20,869
The health is pretty comparable. It's not a blowout in either direction

2916
04:48:23,500 --> 04:48:25,099
That's a big move

2917
04:48:25,099 --> 04:48:34,900
Pick up the bat forget about taunting finish it finish it finish it finish this

2918
04:48:41,180 --> 04:48:42,459

Who the fuck said that?

2934
04:49:55,930 --> 04:49:57,930
Who the fuck said that for me to do that?

2935
04:49:59,349 --> 04:50:05,049
Who said that? I'm very upset with you. Oh jesus

2936
04:50:05,610 --> 04:50:08,299

04:50:18,419 --> 04:50:23,139
career's over I

2939
04:50:23,139 --> 04:50:25,139
For two streams in a row, too

2940
04:50:25,700 --> 04:50:27,700
I don't want to do that

2941
04:50:28,310 --> 04:50:30,310
I can't believe I lost again

2942
04:50:36,919 --> 04:50:40,500
See you in 2021 guys

2943
04:50:40,500 --> 04:50:43,380

2944
04:50:49,779 --> 04:50:50,900
shit

2945
04:50:50,900 --> 04:50:57,299
Well, i'll have to figure that out

2946
04:50:57,540 --> 04:50:59,700
And that's probably where i'm gonna end the stream for tonight

2947
04:51:01,450 --> 04:51:08,549
I think that's a pretty good place to stop

2948
04:51:08,630 --> 04:51:11,049
oh

2949
04:51:11,049 --> 04:51:13,049

2950
04:51:13,529 --> 04:51:18,709
Thanks again to all the mods that really made that possible

2951
04:51:19,349 --> 04:51:21,750

04:51:23,799 --> 04:51:25,400
And thanks for watching everybody

2953
04:51:25,400 --> 04:51:29,290

2959
04:51:54,180 --> 04:51:59,450

I know a lot of you know that I took like three months off

um

2966
04:52:38,900 --> 04:52:43,750
Obviously the pandemic was really really fucking annoying and horrible. It's still going on too

2967
04:52:44,729 --> 04:52:50,490
Uh, so I really really hope that 2021 can just bring so much more happiness to people because 2020 has brought

A lot of shitty times. So, uh, thank you everybody for making at least the 2020 for me fun

I sometimes don't think I do and i'm just really happy that you guys think this is fun

04:54:07,959 --> 04:54:12,520
I'm just happy that you think it's fun. No one's ever obligated to give any money

2985
04:54:12,520 --> 04:54:22,389
I don't read donations anymore. So you don't have to give me any money if you don't want to but it's it's been wild and

2986
04:54:25,750 --> 04:54:30,099

04:56:46,840 --> 04:56:49,959
Catboy made that was not part of the deal. It was not catboy made

3009
