1
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:32,090
Hello, hello. How you doing? Welcome, everybody. A little late. Maybe a few minutes.

2
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:38,439
Vinny and I want to make sure that we could get in the game together. Multiplayer. We did. We are good

3
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:54,310
to go. Welcome to another stream. Give you the game plan today. Part one of the game. Bro, you fell

4
00:00:54,310 --> 00:01:01,140
off. What? What are you talking about? All right. How did I even read that? That was impossible to

5
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:11,129
read. But yeah, today we're going to be doing some sponsored segment of the stream. This part here is

6
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:19,980
sponsored by EA. We're playing Wild Hearts. Looks pretty damn fun. Vinny and I. Vinny is joining us

7
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:33,689
today too. Hashtag ad. Should be fun. Do you read messages that have resident sleeper in it?

8
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:48,980
Every single one of them. And it hurts every single time. Yeah. After this, we're going to be moving to

9
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:57,849
the that last hero nostalgia. Should be a fun night. Looking forward to it. If you don't know

10
00:01:57,849 --> 00:02:04,739
what Wild Hearts is, it's in that monster hunting kind of monster hunter world where it's kind of

11
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:12,699
a monster hunting strategy action game. So if you liked Monster Hunter, you probably would like this

12
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:27,669
too. That world of this type of hunting game. We're going to do face cam today. If you're good,

13
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:40,969
I will turn face cam on if you're good. Everybody's like, oh shit, everybody be good.

14
00:02:40,969 --> 00:02:45,960
Everybody be really good today. Everybody has to be so good because then we're going to see his face.

15
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,780
I also like, okay, I need to like turn my face cam on at some point just to prove that I'm

16
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:57,340
I'm not like covered in bandages or something, right? Like I've seen the concerns and let me

17
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:06,539
tell you, no, I, I'm, I'm fine. I'm not bald. I heard the theory that, oh, I know why he doesn't

18
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:09,900
have the face cam on anymore. It's because he's bald and he went bald and he doesn't want to show

19
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:17,879
us. Nope. We're good. But yeah, thank you EA for sponsoring the stream. Let's get started. Wild Hearts.

20
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:31,750
Vinny, how are you? Like, oh, I forgot to unmute. Hey, hey, hey, hey, how are you? I'm good. Um,

21
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:40,550
we were talking about mitochondria. Really? Yeah. What about mitochondria? It's just cool.

22
00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:45,990
So, um, so, so yes. Uh, how are you? I'm good.

23
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,550
All right. We need to get, we need to bring people up to speed of what happened.

24
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:56,550
We did the tutorial already. We wanted to get right into the goddamn game. You understand?

25
00:03:57,699 --> 00:04:02,949
So we have not picked weapons. I know there are weapons. I think we're still in the tutorial.

26
00:04:03,909 --> 00:04:11,210
Yeah. I think that's correct. We just looks like, yeah, we just like rescued someone and we just

27
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:17,139
set up camp and this is the earliest we could play online together. So we're not sure where this is

28
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:22,660
going to go. But, um, at the moment, I guess we both have long katanas and that's how we will kill

29
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:29,529
this rat. And oh, you, spoiler. Oh, right. Sorry. A rat broke through this and you didn't get to see

30
00:04:29,529 --> 00:04:36,230
it. So we have to go hunt this rat. It was actually really cool. Very sad you didn't see it. This game

31
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:41,509
has, um, like a kind of a weird game play mechanic too, where you can like conjure like crates. Have

32
00:04:41,509 --> 00:04:45,990
you done, like, did you see that? Yeah. Yeah. You could, you can make, right. Watch this.

33
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:52,660
Yeah. All right. Check this out. Yeah. I have to stand up first. Ready? Yeah. All right. Now

34
00:04:52,660 --> 00:05:00,259
watch this. Where'd you go? I don't even know where you went. Oh, wow. That's amazing.

35
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,939
Wow. Oh, sorry. I did it. I just like freaked out. You can like jump off. You build stuff. You can

36
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:10,360
jump. It seems pretty fun. Yeah. It's like, um, breath of the fork knife.

37
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:19,319
Something like that. Yeah. We've got to kill, but you know, it looks really cool because I like the

38
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:25,699
rat. I almost don't want to kill it, but this is kind of the intro monster camp. All right.

39
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:28,259
Vinny, are you ready? Yeah. Yeah. Let's do this.

40
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:40,860
What is this? Have you? Rage tail. Get him. Okay. I'm trying. I'm, I'm, I'm pressing the wrong

41
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:47,100
buttons. Did you ever like play a game a lot and then get used to those buttons and then have to

42
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:51,980
get used to a whole new set of buttons? Yeah. And your brain doesn't know how to like. Oh,

43
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:58,980
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Ready? Uh, use your, uh, your, hold on. Ready? All right. That's

44
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:04,970
actually pretty cool. We do it. Uh, I don't think I did a very good job, but I heard some

45
00:06:05,769 --> 00:06:14,100
weird noises. Yeah. You can, you can jump off these crates. That does a lot of damage. You can,

46
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:18,980
you can lock on to, you probably figured this out already, but yeah. How high can you put the

47
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:25,699
crate? Three at the moment. Maybe there's like a, oh, there's just like fucking everywhere. Can

48
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:33,129
you get the tail? Like, can we, can we do that? I wonder. I hope so. Cause you played other similar

49
00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:40,329
such unnamed monster games. Yeah. Monster Hunter has that in it too. Does the monster

50
00:06:40,329 --> 00:06:53,240
hunter have that? Yeah. Wait, you gotta get the flowers. And if you, you get low on health,

51
00:06:53,240 --> 00:07:03,319
press up, I think on the D pad to heal. I wonder if that's consumable. What is like the rat's tail

52
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:10,490
or. No, no, no. Like the heels. Oh, it is. It is. Yeah. There's like, can you eat the tail?

53
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:17,850
Yeah. That's what I thought. No, you can. I'm going to die. There's like, there's like these

54
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:27,610
healing plants. Here we go. E3 can play commentary. I got your back chef. I've got you back. Stacking

55
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:37,240
crates. Crates now quick to a barrel roll. Oh, there's crates over here. Yeah. There you go.

56
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,800
Oh, sick. I just did a hundred damage. Get it. Now it's now it's time. Now it's time.

57
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:48,759
Right ahead. Now it's time. Now it's time. I think you can charge swings too. Oh, you can.

58
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:54,939
What do you do? Do you do ranged or do you do like melee? In let's say generic monster game

59
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:02,060
where you hunt said monsters, whatever it may be called, I usually go for the switch axe.

60
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:09,480
I like, I'm a ranged Andy. I like the range stuff. Okay. Yeah. I'm John switch axe then

61
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:16,550
because I liked ranged in, which one was it? Monster hunter three you, I think it was. And I

62
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:23,110
did like bow and arrow, but now I do a switch jacks and charge blade. I'm actually curious how

63
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:29,339
many weapons are in the game. Yeah. I'm kind of, I'm also curious to see if there's anything similar

64
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:33,980
to the switch acts. Cause that's like, all right, I got to stop doing that. It was like big chunky

65
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:38,759
weapons. Do I have any heels left? I think I'm out of, you know, I got, I got one more.

66
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:46,009
You can always like, I think you can also grab more from the environment. Oh, right. Right. Right.

67
00:08:46,009 --> 00:08:52,120
Cool. There's like several just chilling. God damn it. Wrong button. We're going to use the,

68
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,679
the crates more. Yeah, they do. They did a hundred damage earlier from the crates.

69
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:10,740
Are you fat rolling? I'm fat rolling. Is there such a thing? I will say chat, like the gameplay,

70
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:17,779
the mechanics of the gameplay feel solid. Yeah. It actually does feel pretty polished in regards

71
00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:27,000
to like hitting the monster in the face. So almost dead. Cool. If you need more healing,

72
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:34,419
there's like, uh, against the trees, there's like green bulbs. Oh, wait, I only have four more of

73
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:43,429
these. Uh, you have to collect like dust. There you go. Right there. I get it. These ones. Oh,

74
00:09:43,429 --> 00:09:53,220
yeah. There we go. I don't know how much crafting is a focus of the game. Vinny Vinny. What are you

75
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:59,779
doing? Oh, oh, sorry. I just got carried away for a second. Yeah. We already made our characters

76
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:04,179
before I started the stream. Yeah. I barely, I spent three minutes making the character. I

77
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:09,799
didn't work too hard on it. There's like default plus like three edits. I was good with that.

78
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:23,220
It's very angry with things bouncing around on its, on its ball. There we go. Oh, there we go.

79
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:29,429
What'd you just do? Oh, I jumped off the crate. Did a hundred damage. I can't wait to make

80
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:34,309
by the way Vinny and Jerma were born in the same year. Are we literally 1985? Yeah. Yeah.

81
00:10:34,309 --> 00:10:39,750
Some chat member. Oh shit. Yeah. I didn't know we were that. Yeah. That's cool. Yeah. What,

82
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:45,990
what month are you? You just had a birthday, right? Uh, no, I'm September. Oh, okay. Boy,

83
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:49,350
time goes quick. Doesn't it? Time does. I really feel like that's the case though.

84
00:10:51,129 --> 00:10:56,809
2023 feels like it started like a week ago. It's fucked up. Yeah. It's crazy. And like there's

85
00:10:56,809 --> 00:11:01,289
already been like a ton of games to play. I don't even have like time in my life to play this many

86
00:11:01,289 --> 00:11:08,649
video games. All right. Drag over here. I got to land that at least once. I'm doing it again.

87
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:23,500
Like why did it tail? Oh, there you go. Oh, did you get it? We got it. Nice. I wonder where's the

88
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:31,720
weak point? I would see the head bulb, big bulb. I'm going for the tail. I've been going for the

89
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:42,169
tail. I've been trying to get that thing off. Watch out. No big swing. That was a very gamer

90
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:48,419
watch out of you. I want to see the weapons. I want to get to, I want to, I, I'm very curious.

91
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:55,720
Yeah, me too. There's actually, this is, this, uh, if you have no weapon on,

92
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:59,240
you can do like a dash slide is pretty helpful. Oh yeah.

93
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:10,820
Durham, I think dead. I think we got it. It's like, no, no. Oh, it's still alive. Mad.

94
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:20,100
It's extra bad. It could spawn a tree. It just got like, do you ever get so angry that you

95
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:27,299
conjured a tree? I like the fact that you can ride on the ball. That's weird. Maybe it hurts.

96
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:41,720
I mean, usually it does. Oh my God. I have no Jesus. Oh, I'm unconscious. Yeah. Just

97
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:52,659
mash, mash buttons. Wait, did you drop something? Someone said, someone said, what the fuck is going

98
00:12:52,659 --> 00:12:58,580
on? Hey, grab, grab. Hey, Dre. Oh, here's an item. Rage tail thing. Just I think you cut it off.

99
00:12:59,539 --> 00:13:06,200
Oh, okay. Okay. Get your head in the game. I know. I know. What does it look like?

100
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,120
We're just a couple of dudes hunting a giant like angry rat.

101
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:18,230
Those cubes, you just do so much more damage. Yeah, you do. All right. Right in the head.

102
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:29,220
There you go. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Finish it. Do you want me to do it? You can do it. Yeah,

103
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:40,759
you do it. Look at your face. I forgot he looks like this. Now stay down. That's it. Why am I

104
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:45,639
saying this to you? What's the chef cooking up this time? See, that's how you do it.

105
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:50,870
Why am I saying that stuff? Now stay down. That's it then. There you go.

106
00:13:54,009 --> 00:14:04,250
Let me increase the volume of Jeremy because you can conjure. Wait, can you make,

107
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:11,370
can we make like a bunch of like, would you like a bunch of like Minecraft piston stuff? Hold on a

108
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:19,590
minute. Kind of looks like it. This thing's going crazy. Yeah, it just propels you forward.

109
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:23,429
All right. That's crates. You can, you can jump up. Oh, I gotta get my car. I didn't even get the

110
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:31,110
car. Is there a car? I think we just got it. Did you get that screen? Did you get a game? Oh,

111
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:35,190
you did a completed screen with all the. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But I didn't see this

112
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:38,950
stuff because I was, I was looking at the chat. All right. Now we got to make sure the woman back

113
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:50,220
safe is the woman back at camp is safe. Oh, we have to go back to camp. Yeah. So I see it. It's

114
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:57,590
the, yeah. The icon. Yeah. It's really, it's convenient when you're a streamer and you can

115
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:05,259
just blame chat whenever you don't see something. It's like, no, I was looking at chat. You're going

116
00:15:05,259 --> 00:15:18,759
on here. We said I unironically want this game. Yeah. I mean, it seems pretty fun. I like how

117
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:25,000
everything has to be like, sorry. Everything has some layer of irony on the internet. So it's like,

118
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:32,279
it's good to clarify just in case, like, you never know when, when there's irony on the internet.

119
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:39,799
Some people don't use CAPAs. How's performance been? Performance has been pretty good for me.

120
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:44,279
There's a little bit of slowdown on some of the new loading areas, but at least from what you're

121
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:48,200
seeing here so far, it's, it seems pretty good. How about you? Yeah. It hasn't, it hasn't been too

122
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:53,559
bad. I'll tell you what it earlier in the tutorial, I had a couple of spots. There's,

123
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:59,960
I think there's a big patch on the way to, which that will be nice, but I turned down like one or

124
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:07,720
two settings and it's been mostly okay. I feel like once it loads a new area, you just run kind

125
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:15,080
of smooth, but yeah, like, you know, it's a new game. I'm moving, I'm moving around a lot. I mean,

126
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:21,590
I, I don't seem to have that many issues. Not saying that people don't have issues, right?

127
00:16:22,309 --> 00:16:41,320
So I guess we talk to her. I do have to admit, I skipped a third of the cutscenes. So I kind of know

128
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,200
what's happening. Oh, I skipped all of them. Oh no, because we were like, oh, let's get,

129
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,440
we've got to get in a game together. Let's test the multiplayer.

130
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:47,720
Mm hmm.

131
00:16:52,809 --> 00:16:59,019
I have like an idea of what's going on. That's my character. Yeah. You look kind of cool.

132
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:06,460
I guess I was like default, default, default, change one thing. Oh, you did default everything.

133
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:24,869
Okay. So big monster. Oh, you can see, you can see all of our Tetris pieces.

134
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:34,660
By the way, your placement of your blocks is fucking awful.

135
00:17:38,819 --> 00:17:40,500
Spread them out a little more moron.

136
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:51,960
I have to, who? He only came with me because I insisted. Wait.

137
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:59,400
Well, you can see when I skipped the dialogue. Yeah. Oh, wait, can I, are you skipping her now?

138
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:10,650
A little bit. Oh, it's a monster. Oh, I just turned the audio off.

139
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:17,369
Okay. So she's a blacksmith and she can help us get weapons. So we're going to,

140
00:18:17,369 --> 00:18:22,490
we're going to get weapons now, I think. Also, I do have to bring this up because this is,

141
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:31,940
this is a good feature. You and I are just in the game together. Yeah. You and we don't, I,

142
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:35,539
I don't, let's see what happens here, but I, we're not, it's not like, oh, we have to join

143
00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:40,839
this lobby and then that lobby. I think we're just in the game permanently. Okay. So, oh yeah,

144
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:47,349
there, I see you. I see the chef, but I'm like, oh, I have to return to you. So wait, you're not

145
00:18:47,349 --> 00:18:57,799
escorting this person. So, okay. That's interesting. You were at camp while I was doing the cut scene.

146
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:03,210
Yeah. Wow. So maybe it just puts me at the camp when you're, if a cut scene is activated.

147
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:14,119
Okay. Hold on. Open your info screen and select. Oh, there's a map. Okay. Turn your face came on.

148
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:21,990
I told you, if you're good, I'll turn it on. Don't threaten them with a good time. Okay. Here we go.

149
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:29,349
So you have like a tree, types of Karakuri. You can use the kimono orbs that you obtain by hunting

150
00:19:29,349 --> 00:19:35,859
kimono to awaken new types of Karakuri or strengthen Karakuri you've already awakened.

151
00:19:35,859 --> 00:19:39,940
Knowledge of certain Karakuri cannot be awakened using kimono orbs. Instead, you need a flash of

152
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:44,519
inspiration in the midst of hunting particular kimono or some other hunting success to unlock

153
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:49,640
such Karakuri secrets and conjure them for the first time. So there's like a tree. Okay. So this

154
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:55,980
is the one we've been using. It's massive. If you scroll all the way down, like hold X and scroll

155
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:06,809
all the way down, it's insane. Oh my God. What is going on? What? I thought that was, it wasn't

156
00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:13,480
repeating. That's a lot of whatever that is. I guess cause this game, it looks like this game's

157
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,960
feature or one of its features to set itself apart is that you can like actually build your camp the

158
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:26,089
way you want to. Oh yeah. Okay. Cool. So yo, that's a lot. Sugoi.

159
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:45,960
Make what? Make what? I didn't hear it. Oh, sorry. I think she said bow. Oh, she's gonna take apart

160
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:55,160
the Katana. Time to choose your weapon. I know I want to switch X. If there's no switch X,

161
00:20:55,160 --> 00:21:03,240
then I'll take the biggest dumbest object I can use. Forging. Have a weapon forged.

162
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:12,380
Oh man. This is like, look at this. Oh, here they are. Well, we can't get all of them right now.

163
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:20,329
It's like, I think, I think you have to do some stuff. All right. But what do I want? Katana?

164
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:30,650
Nodachi, bow, maul, bladed, wagasa. What is that? An umbrella. Yeah. It's an umbrella.

165
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:39,339
What do you think? What are you into? I'll let you choose first and then I'll just,

166
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:43,059
I'll choose second because I'm just happy to be here.

167
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:57,049
I'm just happy to be here. Vinny, you are, you are, you're the best. Thanks man. Well,

168
00:21:57,049 --> 00:22:03,430
I mean, thank you for, you know, getting me the game and stuff. Appreciate it. Vinny's a good dude.

169
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:10,859
All right. So what do you, I think, should I do the, I usually would probably, I'd go maul.

170
00:22:10,859 --> 00:22:17,339
Either maul or bow. I mean, I'll just, I'll probably do the Nodachi then because it's like a big sword.

171
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:25,740
I want to be like Cloud from Final Fantasy 7. Maybe I should do. What do I want to do? What

172
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:35,880
are you guys saying? Wagasa or maul? Can we get a pole? I'll do either one. Looks like you can

173
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:41,079
already upgrade it too. Once you get your first one, like you have the choice of like the weapon

174
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:48,940
tree because we killed that rat now and we could use the rats like bones and gore and like organs

175
00:22:48,940 --> 00:23:00,940
and spleen and stuff. Umbrella now, umbrella now. You know what? All right. I'll do, I'll do the

176
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:12,740
Wagasa. Chat, this is a tough choice. I don't, I don't know which one I want to go. Oh yeah,

177
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:17,220
we already can do this. All right. Critical master or savage. I don't know what savage is.

178
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:26,779
Oh goodness. Okay. I don't, this is, this is a lot of options. Yeah, it's, it's skill details. So

179
00:23:26,779 --> 00:23:32,299
savage increases attack. You can press Y. Critical master boosts the chance of critical strike. So

180
00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:37,339
I'm going to go for my critical sword. I don't have the materials to do the other one. So I

181
00:23:37,339 --> 00:23:42,170
think we're both going to do the critical one. Okay. Although you could wait and go,

182
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:50,180
you could go this other path. There's that left path too. Hey, I want to. Okay. I might as well do

183
00:23:50,180 --> 00:24:00,569
more damage. Okay. I got big sword and then armor too. I don't know if we can make armor.

184
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:05,690
So yeah, they all have their own individual trees. That's cool. Yeah. I mean, it's nice visually.

185
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:16,180
I'm going to get, um, the gauntlets. I think this is just teaching us how to do this. Yeah. Very

186
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:32,569
cool. All right. Let me see your weapon. Ooh. Can you charge it? Big energy. Like I can just like

187
00:24:32,569 --> 00:24:43,220
unleash energy. Wait, I got, I have a hop. That's cool. Umbrella is amazing. Can you,

188
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:51,930
what happens when you hold a ZR or R2? Like I like spin it. I think it's a block or like a parry.

189
00:24:51,930 --> 00:25:01,819
Okay. Can I charge, let me see if I can charge this. It is a parry. All right. That's cool.

190
00:25:01,819 --> 00:25:09,000
The problem with the problem with me is I keep trying to press R and R2 to attack. Yeah. All the

191
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:17,589
Elden Ring, all the, every, all the from software games. Yeah. All right. We, um, oh, make a plan

192
00:25:17,589 --> 00:25:24,660
for the hunt around the campfire. You want to make a plan? Yeah. I unlocked something else though.

193
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:33,539
See if I can figure that out. I unlocked a, um, so we got a drying rack for food. Let's make some

194
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:41,190
steaks. And I also got a hunting tower that uses celestial thread to seek out kimono in the

195
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:47,720
wilderness. Sends out pulses from the turret to use as echoes that return the chart. Okay. So we

196
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:55,720
can find monsters. Okay. So we, when you sit down at the campfire is when you decide on what you

197
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:02,259
want to do next. Okay. From the map, you can take on quests or travel instantly to camps and other

198
00:26:02,259 --> 00:26:06,980
places out in the wilderness. Quests come about when the people of Minato make requests of you

199
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:10,180
and your hunting skills. And when there's a kimono thread that needs it. So we can kind of

200
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:16,150
port around. Some can be taken as many times as you like, right? Okay. So I think there's like

201
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:19,660
story missions. There's other missions, but I think we can just do it from together from the

202
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:30,599
campfire. So yeah, I see, I see more rage tales, but, um, I don't know. It's up to you. What do

203
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:34,420
you want to, you want to go for another rage tale or do you want to, I don't know how we find like

204
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:40,950
new monsters. I think we can do rage tale again if we want to, but, um, we talked to her for another

205
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:50,460
one. Yeah. You want to do it? Yeah, let's do it. Actually you might have to do it because you're

206
00:26:50,460 --> 00:27:01,240
the host. Oh, that's right. Okay. So wait, what happens when you, um, do you watch this or you're

207
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,119
just like running around looking at nothing? No, I can see, I can see what you're doing.

208
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:09,660
Oh, okay. Okay. There's a weapon later in the game that's basically the charge blade

209
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,900
switch axe thing you're looking for. Sick.

210
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:24,420
The monster design is actually very good.

211
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:35,700
It looks like they put like truthfully, they put a lot of like budget into making things look cool.

212
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:52,420
Someone said crisis looks better. What do you know about my brother in crisis? That is a 20

213
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:57,859
year old game. Somebody just said, what do you know about design? I don't know. I just think

214
00:27:57,859 --> 00:28:05,380
the games, I just play games. I don't know. All right. Saps scourge. So we're going after the

215
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:13,380
step. Are we, are we prepared? Huh? Um, yeah, I feel like the preparation is, is less than we

216
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:20,630
would expect maybe, but let me talk to her again. Yeah, it's, I'm ready to rock and roll.

217
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:28,650
Yeah, we can, we can just start fighting like, do we have to remove these or are they just all

218
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:35,259
permanently here? They're just still here. Oh yeah. Why are they still here? I think they're

219
00:28:35,259 --> 00:28:41,420
permanent. You have to be very, maybe you can take them down. Do you have enough healing like juice?

220
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:47,660
Um, wait, if you conjure a hunting tower, you'll be able to detect kimono in the surrounding area.

221
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:55,640
Yeah, I got one of those in the tower. I, I, I did one of those. That's, uh,

222
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:03,539
Oh, and I think it wants us to make it. Oh, I can catch the snake. I just caught a snake.

223
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:07,450
Can't fire. Where's hunting tower? Wait, do you see the enemy?

224
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:14,230
All right. So the game is telling us to go down the tree in your Karakuri tree and unlock the

225
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:20,970
hunting tower. It's like a radar. Okay. Cause I, I have the monster on my, uh,

226
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:29,430
UI. I can see it for the wall too. All right. Um, did you see that little fella? Where?

227
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:37,910
This little fella here. Oh, I see a friend. Hunter aids. You can enhance them at campfires.

228
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:48,299
I think those are like cats. Did you collect them? Yeah. I think you, you collect them and then you

229
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:54,460
can use them to like tank hits from giant rats so that you don't, you don't die. And they do

230
00:29:54,460 --> 00:30:00,059
something like that. Make changes to them. Okay. Cool. I think we have to upgrade our menu at least

231
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:07,720
down to the tower. How did you know how to do that? In your menu, go to the Karakuri menu.

232
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:18,299
It's like to the right and then hunting tower. What does this actually do? Field Forge. Um,

233
00:30:18,299 --> 00:30:25,819
Oh, I think we can build stuff out in the wilderness. Okay. That's cool. We can build a

234
00:30:25,819 --> 00:30:31,819
tower here. Yeah. So I guess this, um, seek out kimono in the wilderness. It sounds out pulses

235
00:30:31,819 --> 00:30:36,539
from the turret and uses the echoes that returned to chart the lay of the land. And look, I say,

236
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:41,430
I think it's like, you can get map reveal with it. Yeah. I, I built one at base and, um,

237
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:51,720
I'll build another one here and see if this does anything, but it's already in operation. It says,

238
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:59,559
Oh, there it is. Okay. Yeah. I don't know. So I think, I think this just kind of sits on the map.

239
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:04,920
Maybe it beeps when, uh, it detects something nearby. Oh, we just follow the thread. If you

240
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:16,569
hold L two, it just like shows you like a path to the enemy. I got full heels. Okay. There it is.

241
00:31:16,569 --> 00:31:23,690
Is this on iPad? Um, no, it's not. What the fuck is that? Look up. There's two of them. Oh gosh.

242
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:31,029
Why is there two? Why? Okay. Well, these days monster games need to have at least two.

243
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:41,940
All right, let's go. Oh boy. I wonder how the parry work. It said we can request assistance.

244
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:45,619
I guess we could just get like randos to jump in. I'm imagining it's probably that.

245
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,940
All right. I'm going to build a spring and see what this is.

246
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:57,589
I hope that other thing doesn't. The other thing is still over there. It's hiding.

247
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:14,359
Oh boy. Are you dead? No, almost. I'm just healing. What are we thinking? What are we thinking?

248
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:21,640
I'm just going to put shit everywhere. Head empty. All right. I might be like annoying,

249
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:27,000
but whatever. No, no, no. I'm trying. I do it. You put everything everywhere.

250
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,559
I just did like 150 damage or more to this thing.

251
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:42,700
Ooh. All right. That's funny. Use a spring to dodge. Oh, you put these around to not get.

252
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:47,339
Okay. I get it. I get it. I get it. So you put them in places where you know you can dodge.

253
00:32:48,220 --> 00:33:05,559
Trying to charge my attack. Yeah. Oh, some of the sack blue.

254
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:16,890
It's fine. I do like a weird dive. I would go straight down on the crown of my head.

255
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:32,309
I kind of float in the air. Also. Yeah, dude. The amount of damage you do from a tower is insane.

256
00:33:32,309 --> 00:33:38,220
It's unbelievable. It's so good. All right. I figured out how this thing works.

257
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:45,460
You want to be in the air. Wait, is it gone? Wait, wait. I think you might've,

258
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:49,059
I think you, you cut something off over here. Did I? Okay. Hang on.

259
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:55,319
Zap Scourge Amber. I just picked up a weird thing that allows me to build more stuff. I think.

260
00:33:55,319 --> 00:34:02,259
I don't know. Hold R T and X to build your meter faster and then release R T for a charged attacks

261
00:34:02,259 --> 00:34:09,219
as a chat member. Helpful help. Today we have helpful chat members. Like I didn't, I didn't know.

262
00:34:10,019 --> 00:34:17,050
So wait, where did, where did that monster go? All right. We got a marker. Yeah. We got a marker.

263
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:31,820
There's a rage tail behind us, but yeah, let's just mark it. Oh no. Oh, that's a turtle. I chat.

264
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:35,099
I get it. You're trying to get me to say the forbidden words. I'm not going to say them

265
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:45,079
just like wiped his eyes. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, look, look, look. Yes. What? This is one of those

266
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:55,659
friends. Oh, okay. I'll grab one. Okay. We need the bear at the camp logic to train and see all the

267
00:34:55,659 --> 00:35:00,380
combos you can do. Interesting. That's, that's the way you work it. That's the way you go for it.

268
00:35:04,789 --> 00:35:09,190
Put down some of those, those tools and just bounce off them and jump in the air and stuff.

269
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:30,650
Okay. Oh, it rolls around. Oh, I got to collect that. Wrong thing.

270
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:42,230
Dude. Yeah. You fly in the air. I like that. This weapon is actually pretty fun.

271
00:35:46,539 --> 00:35:55,849
More stuff rolls around, comes around. I guess so. Yeah. That's sort of fun too.

272
00:35:55,849 --> 00:36:03,269
What's the thing around it on his left leg? Like a blue thing? Uh, I don't know.

273
00:36:03,349 --> 00:36:19,269
It's like a wonderful spot. Yeah, that's weird. I don't know what that is. Damn it. Things.

274
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:23,289
I want to try the parry. I'm going to try a parry. Let's see what happens.

275
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:28,010
Wait, is that a specific to your weapon? Oh, it is. It is. I think so. I wonder how it works.

276
00:36:28,969 --> 00:36:39,179
Wait, I think we did enough damage. It's running. All right. Use springs quick.

277
00:36:40,059 --> 00:36:48,679
I mean, I mean, they help a little bit. We are just fucking up this whole area though.

278
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:54,519
These are going to be here forever. Yeah. Oh, this beautiful area. We like,

279
00:36:54,519 --> 00:37:00,739
this is a comment on industrialization, this game. I used all of my breads.

280
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:14,360
I know there's more. It's like some of the trees maybe. Oh, you can slide too.

281
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:19,320
Chat member, I swear you've typed that like 18 times since I started.

282
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:23,800
Look out for the snake. Look at this guy. This guy's just trying to hang. No.

283
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:29,880
I need to save the snake so bad. Okay. Thank God. That's like the most concerning thing

284
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:42,150
of the whole game for me so far. What's wrong with me? Oh, oh God. Oh, I got out just in time.

285
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:52,019
I'm out. I gotta get more. He loves animals. Yeah. As I kill one right here. Yeah.

286
00:37:53,139 --> 00:38:04,440
And forests. We love the forests. You keep chopping down the trees like that. Oh,

287
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:17,019
shoot some sticky. All right. You, I sappy substance. Oh, where is he? Okay. Oh, I'm

288
00:38:17,019 --> 00:38:25,699
going to use yours. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It really does. So it's insane. Like I, and I combo with

289
00:38:25,699 --> 00:38:34,090
it. Like I ended up doing like a hundred hits. I love the elbow drop that I can do with this thing.

290
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:48,869
Okay. I just got really knocked off. Oh, Vinny, I might die. I'm going to die. I'm trying to help.

291
00:38:48,869 --> 00:38:55,349
I'm trying to get attention. Dodge chef. Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. I just went back into the fire.

292
00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:05,989
Oh, he's angry Vinny. Oh boy. Yeah. It's dropping like, like,

293
00:39:05,989 --> 00:39:12,309
Oh, whatever this is. Oh, sap scourge. That's right. That's the name. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Look at

294
00:39:12,309 --> 00:39:17,900
this. Hold on. Can you climb this? I'm going off the top rope. Oh my God. It's eating me.

295
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:21,500
It's a tree. It's a tree and it's eating me. How does it have a mouth?

296
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:31,820
Where you be? Where are you? Sorry. Sorry to make all these weird noises. No, it's all right. No,

297
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:35,739
I'm good. It's just this, this enemy is literally like a tree creature. I didn't even realize that

298
00:39:35,739 --> 00:39:52,739
until just now. It's taken down the whole forest. It's so sappy. Jesus. Shit. I missed you climb

299
00:39:52,739 --> 00:39:59,639
freeze. Not like you can climb the crates. I don't think those are like made. Those crates were made

300
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:20,619
for climbing. That's just what they'll do. Yeah. Same here. I'm sorry. I keep missing it and it's

301
00:40:20,619 --> 00:40:34,280
so cool. Great egg commentary. Okay. I feel like we're in the last phase here. We have to be. It's

302
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:44,139
angry. We've been hitting it. There we go. We've been sapped upon several times by now. Oh,

303
00:40:44,940 --> 00:41:06,889
Oh, under leveled. Oh, he is eating me too. Here we go. It's good damage on now.

304
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:14,889
I'm trying to see. I know there's like other attacks that you can combo. Like I'm seeing in

305
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:21,690
the top right. Oh, that's hot dog. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Massive damage. Absolutely

306
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:28,940
massive damage for me. Get that shit. Get up there. Drop the crates. Get up the crate.

307
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:48,969
You did 40 DPS. I'm doing fine. Jay is saying that my graphics look better than your graphics.

308
00:41:48,969 --> 00:41:55,289
You do. I don't know. You have to show little bro. Germa your settings as a chat member.

309
00:41:55,289 --> 00:42:01,510
What are your settings? Um, I don't know. I have most things on high. I got rid of ambient

310
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:06,789
inclusion and motion blur and everything else is on high. It looks apparent chat saying it like

311
00:42:07,429 --> 00:42:13,829
my graphics is good. My graphics are not good. All right. I don't know. Look better. You have

312
00:42:13,829 --> 00:42:19,659
a better GPU than me though. I do. Yeah, you do look better. We don't get time for this. We

313
00:42:19,659 --> 00:42:33,269
got to hunt the monster. Yeah, we got to. That's right. Oh, there's a little fella here. I don't

314
00:42:33,269 --> 00:42:39,590
know if we can catch it. I caught it. The same graphics are wicked crisp. Why am I not crisp?

315
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:46,780
I didn't apply them. Is that chat member from Boston? Did you actually say wicked growing up?

316
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:50,139
Like was that like a regional thing? Because we did not have that in New York. All the time.

317
00:42:50,139 --> 00:42:53,980
No one was saying wicked when I was growing up. Like when Ocarina of Time came out, no one was

318
00:42:53,980 --> 00:43:00,599
saying it was a wicked cool game in New York. That was actually a thing Germa that you were

319
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:09,159
saying wicked. I said wicked all the time. Yeah. Did you ever hear of like herbs? Do you know like

320
00:43:09,159 --> 00:43:16,789
when someone's a herb? That I don't. I don't know. Okay. Is that what you. I think a little

321
00:43:16,789 --> 00:43:23,670
little bit of that or if someone's a skel, do you know skel? Skel? No. Yeah. Like if they're on like

322
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:32,469
a fellow of ill repute is a skel. We got we've got a weird we've got like an asparagus dragon over

323
00:43:32,469 --> 00:43:51,530
here. Yeah. Let's do it. Why is this here? Let's get rolled over. I love I'm fighting just like

324
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:56,570
the random shitty enemy and it's an intense fight and you're over there fighting the real monster.

325
00:43:56,570 --> 00:44:14,219
I'm trying it. Oh, you got it. You actually got the tail. You could do it. It's real. Climb it.

326
00:44:14,219 --> 00:44:22,059
Climb. Oh shit. I'm on his back. Oh, you can do that. I'm on his back. What do I do? I don't

327
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:38,489
know. Press buttons. All right. I'm still fine. Come on Vinny. Kill it. I don't know. How do I

328
00:44:38,489 --> 00:45:03,159
thrust? Oh, those hits. I hope there's no damage meter because you're probably doing 80% of all

329
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:08,199
the damage. I don't think so, man. I'm doing okay. But there are moments where I just don't get any

330
00:45:08,199 --> 00:45:18,489
hits for like a minute. There's no health bar. There usually isn't in these games. Yeah. No,

331
00:45:18,489 --> 00:45:31,940
you just have to like if the monster is like limping or if the monster seems tired or weak,

332
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:39,349
that's how you know you're almost done. Definitely on this there. We have to be. You need to parry

333
00:45:39,349 --> 00:45:46,150
to do real damage with this weapon. All right. I'll learn it after this. Finish what? Oh, wait.

334
00:45:46,150 --> 00:46:03,190
This thing's still alive. That was kind of sad. Oh, oh no. Shit. I'm going to try to parry.

335
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:11,239
Oh, I'm dead. Okay. I don't think I can get you back. I think I can get. I'm going to see.

336
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:26,420
Be careful. Oh, it's eating me alive. Oh my God. Bro, why? No, no, no. I'm sapped up. I'm

337
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:31,849
saying this about killing monsters. I'm sitting there going like, oh no.

338
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:43,130
Let's see. I think I can rescue. I can rescue you. Oh my goodness. You were just in time.

339
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:57,579
Died to sap scourge omega low. I'm fine. Don't know the combos. If I would be so much more

340
00:46:57,579 --> 00:47:02,739
effective with this weapon. If I knew the combos, I've got to figure out the parry. That's how you

341
00:47:02,739 --> 00:47:10,860
get this to work. Yeah. For yours, that would probably be amazing. Even angrier. We are at

342
00:47:11,179 --> 00:47:20,789
anger levels. Never seen before. Stay alive. Keep going. That's sap off of us.

343
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:30,099
Ungar max. That's right. That's Barrett's limit break in final fantasy. Ungar max.

344
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:35,219
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill. Did you ever hear about that? What was it?

345
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:40,260
There was a mistranslation of Barrett's limit break in final fantasy seven.

346
00:47:41,219 --> 00:47:47,079
And they called it Ungar max when it should have been anger max. We won. I was like a little kid.

347
00:47:47,079 --> 00:47:54,309
I was like, what's Ungar max? Yeah, they just mistranslated it. Hey, I got the final blow.

348
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:10,440
All right. Ungar. New word every day. Flying vine. Karakuri awaken. Oh, that's me. Yeah. So

349
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:16,280
one of the big selling points of this game is the fact that you can put, I mean, we're doing these

350
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:21,480
things, but there are a ton of these tools. You can like put like zip lines around. You could,

351
00:48:21,559 --> 00:48:26,440
I think it's pretty handy to make like almost like a little fort in the monster fight area.

352
00:48:27,159 --> 00:48:33,110
Like at night. Well, during the day too. Okay. During the day too. Good. Good.

353
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:46,059
Your gamma is too high. I'm a regular hunter. If you say so. Can I turn my gamma down?

354
00:48:48,139 --> 00:48:58,010
Turn down your gamma. My gamma is like so high. Is that why the graphics is different? I think

355
00:48:58,010 --> 00:49:10,199
that's probably what's going on. Yeah. You mean that explains it. She roped me to doing her dirty

356
00:49:10,199 --> 00:49:14,920
work for turn on ambient occlusion. It breaks the shaders. If it's off. Okay. Oh, all right.

357
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:23,670
Mine are off too. I'll turn mine back on then. Weird. You made camp teacher in that case lead

358
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:32,650
the way much as I like the idea of a statue in my honor. I don't want to keep it. So this takes

359
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:40,489
place in medieval Japan. Yeah, that's right. I was thinking or like some very, I mean there's

360
00:49:40,489 --> 00:49:46,340
monsters. So look at this. You, you awaken the flying vine dragon. Hold on a minute.

361
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:53,579
Did you see that? Yeah. Let's see if we can make it. Instruct your own network of corridors

362
00:49:53,579 --> 00:49:57,179
through the wilderness. Yeah. That's what I'm saying. I think we're, I think everything is

363
00:49:57,179 --> 00:50:03,820
permanent. We're supposed to make essentially our own permanent resources to travel around.

364
00:50:07,429 --> 00:50:19,400
Let's see if we can do it. Let me do this real quick. The tail is, I think I carved the tail

365
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:25,420
already chat. Like there would be like a green stink around it if I didn't. And I'm pretty sure

366
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:35,559
I got that. Oh, that does look better. Oh, you know what? Here, let me turn the ambient occlusion

367
00:50:35,559 --> 00:50:44,409
on. Oh, it's a thousand times better. Wow. Okay. Yeah. They weren't kidding. Yeah. This actually

368
00:50:44,409 --> 00:50:51,980
looks like this is great. I had my, I had my gamma up like way too high. All right, cool.

369
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:57,739
I'm trying to build the thing, the flying vine thing. Yeah. Cause we're in a cave. We can't

370
00:50:57,739 --> 00:51:12,809
let's, let's get out of this cave and see what happens. Oh, I got one. You did it. Yep. This

371
00:51:12,809 --> 00:51:25,420
should help. Oh, wait. Oh, I didn't, I made the wrong thing. Wait, did I make the wrong thing?

372
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:34,119
Maybe. I made like, I made like a fucking, like a trebuchet. Oh, wait. No, I think that's it.

373
00:51:34,119 --> 00:51:44,409
It's the one all the way to the right, right? Why are you not holding A? Wait. Oh, whoa, whoa,

374
00:51:44,409 --> 00:51:48,969
whoa. I get it. Oops. I blew it. You got to hold A. Oh, I blew it big time. I get it.

375
00:51:50,170 --> 00:51:53,769
Okay. You have to aim the thing and shoot it. I thought it was that we connected together.

376
00:51:54,409 --> 00:52:15,960
Let me try it. Okay. Wait, how do I yeet myself? Oh, you jump and you hold right bumper.

377
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:30,739
You hold right? Um, RBA. I re I press that chat. I press that. It's literally tells you.

378
00:52:30,739 --> 00:52:35,699
I know it tells me, but it's not working. RB. Oh, I was pressing LB. Dude, that thing's going

379
00:52:35,699 --> 00:52:42,179
like two feet. It's fine. Do you want, oh, you're all the way over there. Let me get to you real

380
00:52:42,179 --> 00:52:51,559
quick. No, there's nothing over here. It's fine. I mean, all right. That was, all right. That's

381
00:52:51,559 --> 00:52:56,519
cool. It's, it's cool, but it didn't, I didn't really build an effective one. We need to,

382
00:52:56,519 --> 00:53:02,570
okay. The next Mossberry fight, we have to build a little base around it. Okay. You can teleport

383
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:14,650
to camp from the maps as a chat member. Oh, you can. You can. Oh, you can. It's useful.

384
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:21,179
Only hosts can do that. Wait, no, no, no. Okay. I'm good. I'm gone. Oh, there you are. Okay. Here.

385
00:53:21,179 --> 00:53:30,420
I'm going to build one of these. The dragon pit isn't powerful enough. Oh, we need more like

386
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:35,619
capacity to build extra stuff. I think I am going to become so compulsive with this because these

387
00:53:35,619 --> 00:53:47,989
things are permanent. Hunter with death stranding. There's elements of both. You're sure. What's up,

388
00:53:47,989 --> 00:53:53,349
Jeremy? I was going to say the, if everything is permanent, I feel like there's a lot of people

389
00:53:53,349 --> 00:53:57,349
that are going to make insane travel basis. Like you're going to be able to go anywhere.

390
00:53:58,789 --> 00:54:03,590
Some of you that get this game and just build networks. Yeah. I'm curious like the insane

391
00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:09,110
networks people are going to build with all the stuff unlocked. I'd be preserved in amber right

392
00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:20,570
now. Exposed for all to see. You paint a green picture. It really was fortunate. You're right.

393
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:25,530
Did you see this one in battle? We are face cam imminent by the way. I want to make sure

394
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:34,920
everyone's aware. I know creating out of thin air like that. That's a skill I simply have to learn.

395
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:39,400
Good. We've, we were good. We've been good. I'd like to get back to me.

396
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:49,400
No, I'm not turning. I don't know. Oh no. Yeah. No, don't wait. Not, you know, not you. No,

397
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:53,239
no. My, my chat's like, you should do it too. Vin. I'm like, I don't care how good the chat's been.

398
00:54:54,679 --> 00:54:58,599
I've been, uh, lazy for that. I've been streaming with it off, uh, with it off recently.

399
00:55:00,539 --> 00:55:04,380
It's just, it's nice because I could sit back in my chair and I can just look like shit.

400
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:09,179
I know not have like light lights on. Like I can stream in the dark and damage my eyes. It's fun.

401
00:55:10,219 --> 00:55:17,960
I like it. I was using a game boy camera for a while and you like, that was actually my,

402
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,400
were you actually doing that? Not a real one, but I found a way to make it work.

403
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:31,019
Oh, that's so funny. It was cool. What was that? Oh, I thought he, I thought he farted.

404
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:34,940
Suburban Sasquatch.

405
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:39,579
Probably haven't eaten a thing since we were, I was looking over at the chat and I just said,

406
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:45,739
okay, so we're going to eat because that guy's stomach was growling and we have food.

407
00:55:46,619 --> 00:55:48,059
All right. There we go. It's all real.

408
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:59,219
That's a very interesting way to sit. Let's not linger here any longer.

409
00:55:59,219 --> 00:56:01,059
Good. It's, it's, it's good on the spine.

410
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:05,449
Mm hmm. It's a nice permanent spine damage.

411
00:56:06,090 --> 00:56:06,489
Fuck. Yeah.

412
00:56:13,539 --> 00:56:23,559
That's fun. Oh, wait, what's this chat members? Oh, hang on. I just tabbed out by accident. Chat

413
00:56:23,559 --> 00:56:34,550
member. Can you repeat that about the audio thing? You have to break the dragon vines you place to

414
00:56:34,550 --> 00:56:39,670
make more. And two, if you change your audio settings to 5.1, your FPS gets doubled. Really?

415
00:56:40,309 --> 00:56:47,989
5.1. Huh. All right. I'll try. Let's try it.

416
00:56:47,989 --> 00:56:51,860
You'll have to do this scouting alone. Please slow you down.

417
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:56,059
So you say go to audio? My FPS are good. I don't like,

418
00:56:56,059 --> 00:56:59,099
I haven't had, I've had stutters a little bit, but nothing terrible.

419
00:56:59,099 --> 00:57:06,300
No. Put on it, put it on 5.1, 7.1?

420
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:11,559
Yeah. Okay. 7.1, 5.1. We'll give it a shot.

421
00:57:14,809 --> 00:57:20,070
Someone mentioned the audio thing in critical's chat too. All right, we'll see.

422
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:22,630
That actually like kind of, that actually kind of worked.

423
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:31,960
I mean, it was, it was fine before, but wait a minute. Oh, this is the training thing.

424
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:40,550
Did you fight the bear? No, not yet. I'm going to do that. Oh, that's what this is. Yeah.

425
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:50,440
Okay. Bunging comet from reverse lunge. So you go wham, then you go wham.

426
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:57,980
DRG has a similar bug. It's with internal EQ. Okay. Interesting. So once I could charge this,

427
00:57:57,980 --> 00:58:06,260
like faster, what was the charge button? I just did 795 damage.

428
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:12,420
What? Not a second. I was, we were, I was doing like three damages swing.

429
00:58:13,139 --> 00:58:16,659
You just did 700 damage. Yeah. Yeah. I did a full charge

430
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:24,329
with the sword and I got that much damage. What? Okay. That's, that's interesting.

431
00:58:24,329 --> 00:58:32,469
Oh, I see. Okay. With this weapon, I can charge and attack while I'm charging and then unleash

432
00:58:33,110 --> 00:58:37,989
a 700 damage attack. Crazy. Absolutely insane damage.

433
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:40,949
Come under attack while in parry stance. Hold on.

434
00:58:44,150 --> 00:58:52,889
I want to bring one of these little fellas with me. Is that working? Do I have to time it? Like

435
00:58:53,610 --> 00:59:07,800
press LT next to the bear. Oh, deficient materials.

436
00:59:12,219 --> 00:59:18,619
I need to parry it. Isn't that, it's not working. Parry successfully for big spin dance.

437
00:59:25,099 --> 00:59:34,679
Oh, okay. So it's not, wait a minute. All right. It's not the top of the weapon. It's, I get it.

438
00:59:35,639 --> 00:59:41,559
So during a box, you're right. Where are you? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just equipping stuff in a box.

439
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:47,639
So you parry, parry, parry, parry, parry, build up your gauge and then you've got ultra damage.

440
00:59:50,699 --> 00:59:56,550
This is hard. This is, this is tricky. You probably chose like the most technical weapon

441
00:59:58,309 --> 01:00:04,789
like by accident. This is now your thing. Okay. So during parry counter attack,

442
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:10,550
I'm not caught up with this one. I think I have to use them all. I have to use them all.

443
01:00:14,070 --> 01:00:20,179
Oh shit. All right. Wait, wait, wait. I got a full gauge.

444
01:00:24,119 --> 01:00:30,920
Vinny, why are you fondling that poor ball? Don't, do not incite ball fondler.

445
01:00:32,119 --> 01:00:41,719
Do not like summon him. Whatever you do. Okay. I think I'm getting it down. Now how much damage

446
01:00:41,719 --> 01:00:52,170
does it do? Nice. All right. Oh wow. I'm doing so much more damage to swing now. Mid dodge attack.

447
01:00:53,800 --> 01:01:10,250
Nice. Okay. Oh, this really does just teach you all your combos. That's awesome. Yeah. All right. Oh

448
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:15,449
my God, dude. I was swinging and hitting the back of the bark on the back of that last enemy's back

449
01:01:16,010 --> 01:01:20,010
and was doing one damage to swing. I'm doing like a hundred damage now.

450
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:32,260
Nice. I wonder if I was so useless in that last fight. Okay. Mount spring, then mid leap.

451
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:45,380
Great based attack. There's a lot of travel attacks. It seems like. Yeah. I just got to get

452
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:57,130
the parry down. Mount spring and then X mid leap. Wait, you can mount a spring. Oh, I see what it

453
01:01:57,130 --> 01:02:06,380
means. Okay. So you have to like spring into the enemy and then attack. Cool. So I'm imagining that

454
01:02:07,179 --> 01:02:12,780
chat helped me out here. When my gauge is higher, I do more damage. Obviously. I mean, obviously.

455
01:02:21,610 --> 01:02:27,340
Nah. Cool. Yeah. Now it's like we both know how to play the game now. Yeah. So that's good.

456
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:39,159
You both got it down. Yeah. What about these little guys? Yeah. So I just upgraded that little dude.

457
01:02:39,159 --> 01:02:45,159
I don't know what it does exactly, but you know, you can like, I think you can carry more stuff

458
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:52,039
for crates. That seemed to be like what happened. You lose the gauge very quick when taking damage

459
01:02:52,039 --> 01:03:04,889
or not fighting anyone. Attack form? Jerma, there's food too, but you can, you can draw your meat

460
01:03:04,889 --> 01:03:09,530
and then it'll like give you attack and health bonuses and stuff. I just learned.

461
01:03:11,619 --> 01:03:24,760
Ooh, let's do it. Find out what creature made the roar. Ooh. Okay. Dry ingredients. Oh, this is what

462
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:33,369
you're talking about. Jerma, is this woman stuck in a box for you too? Whenever, whenever you're

463
01:03:33,369 --> 01:03:43,239
over there. Um, I'll check it out in a sec. Yeah. Yeah. No rush. Cubed meat. I'm just drying a bunch

464
01:03:43,239 --> 01:03:54,329
of meat. Luigi, I'm stuck in a little box. It's me, Mario. I need you to get me out of here.

465
01:03:54,329 --> 01:04:00,150
I'm just drying meat. Mario, Mario, what are you doing in the box? I'm in the box too.

466
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:05,420
What are you doing in there? Get out of there. That's dangerous. Someone just said you're

467
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:13,030
embarrassing us. I mean, I'm embarrassing myself, not, not you, chat. No, no, no. I, I don't think

468
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:19,260
you, I did. You don't get embarrassed here. Do you understand the things that I've said? Yeah,

469
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:25,460
I know. I know. Yeah. Don't worry. We are all collectively weird here. Don't worry. Yes. That's,

470
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:29,989
that's fair. All right. Let's make, hold on. Let's make one of those. I'm going to make one of these

471
01:04:29,989 --> 01:04:35,619
things and you're going to see how cool it is. Ready? Yeah. Check this shit out. Now, before you

472
01:04:35,619 --> 01:04:40,420
do that, the Jerma, I have a, there's a sign over here that you can place. It was, it's, there's a

473
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:49,719
weird message on it. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Check this out. It's weird. Like I just read it. I was

474
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:54,519
like, how, how did that sign get there? Like, why does it say that this one? Let me investigate.

475
01:04:54,519 --> 01:05:16,010
Hold on. Yeah. Right here. Yeah. All right. You want to go hunt a monster now? Really? Really?

476
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:23,960
I want to sponsor stream Vinny. All right. We need to make that a, speaking of sponsor,

477
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:29,690
thank you EA for sponsoring the stream. The game is out right now. It is wild hearts.

478
01:05:29,690 --> 01:05:34,250
You can get it on PlayStation five, Xbox series X and series S as well as PC.

479
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:39,559
Those are the best times to possibly do that. If you're into the monster hunting

480
01:05:40,619 --> 01:05:51,590
kind of lifestyle, this is potentially the game for you. Weirdly enough, that switching audio

481
01:05:51,590 --> 01:05:56,869
thing actually increased my performance by quite a bit. I mean, I would say that what I'm looking at

482
01:05:56,869 --> 01:06:02,309
right now, yeah, I would call, I would call it beautiful. Like a marginal difference. Yeah.

483
01:06:02,309 --> 01:06:15,829
Really? During my sponsored stream? Really? Unbelievable. Oh my God. Vinny killed him.

484
01:06:16,630 --> 01:06:23,130
I had to, had to. All right. So we wait. Oh shit. I forgot about, I, my, I wasted stuff.

485
01:06:24,340 --> 01:06:27,300
All right. You ready Vinny? Check this out. Yeah. We're going to make this happen here.

486
01:06:28,019 --> 01:06:33,510
Okay. I don't have enough resources. You need to make one. Make what? Oh, we need to tear that

487
01:06:33,510 --> 01:06:38,469
down. Hold on. Come back over here. I'm just getting smacked by a goat, by a fantasy goat.

488
01:06:38,469 --> 01:06:46,920
Hang on. Let's just take care of this. All right. I think we can only make a certain amount of

489
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:55,590
objects in. Correct. Yeah. Yes. So if we have too many, we should probably remove some, right?

490
01:06:56,630 --> 01:07:08,539
Can I do that? So how do I? You can dismantle from the menu, I think. Oh wait. I don't know.

491
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:21,139
How do we do that? Cause it says, uh, dragon pit isn't powerful enough and see dragon pit capacity.

492
01:07:21,139 --> 01:07:30,280
We're at kind of minus 13 right now for that or two old L one and press up. Oh, dismantle. There

493
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:39,289
it is. Yep. You press, you press the right stick in. I found another sign. It's weird. Another one.

494
01:07:41,619 --> 01:07:45,539
Well, you got another sign. Let me see what's on it. No, no, no, no. You're no, you're good. You're

495
01:07:45,539 --> 01:07:53,099
good. Not during your sponsored stream. Check this out. We are going to make a zip line from here to

496
01:07:53,099 --> 01:07:58,300
there to the, to the mountain. Okay. Cause my zip line is placed in a very inconvenient area and I

497
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:02,619
think I'd have to go over to it and dismantle it. Okay. We have so much shit everywhere. I can't

498
01:08:02,619 --> 01:08:14,920
feel it. Looks like we're walking. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. What if we, um, touch the dragon pit

499
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:22,250
here? Do you have a small mist crystal by chance? Do you still want to eat shit? No, no, no, no,

500
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:29,140
don't do that. Um, German over here. Can you, can you touch this dragon pit? Cause if you do that,

501
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:35,000
we can then build more stuff in this area. Only hosts can do that. Goddammit. Can you do it?

502
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:50,699
I can't because I'm missing a small mist crystal. Wait, maybe I have one. Small mist crystal.

503
01:08:50,699 --> 01:08:56,229
Wait, this might be it right here. No, that's crystal ore. I have a shitload of them. Can I

504
01:08:56,229 --> 01:09:02,680
give them to you? Open your crafting and hit right stick and you can dismantle the boxes.

505
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:10,260
All right. So if you do that, oh, wrong button. So if you do that right. Uh, and then you can make

506
01:09:10,260 --> 01:09:18,119
it huge so you can just get rid of everything. All right. That's the least you can do that.

507
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:32,090
Wait, how do you dismiss? Oh, nice. Okay. Can you, can you, can you build the thing now? The,

508
01:09:32,090 --> 01:09:37,529
the zip line? Like I'm really, I cannot really dedicate it to the zip line. I didn't know.

509
01:09:38,170 --> 01:09:46,710
I cannot build it. I can build this other stuff though. So we only have, okay. So we have two

510
01:09:47,829 --> 01:09:52,859
of that capacity on the top row. I think I honestly, I'm going to be honest with you. I

511
01:09:52,859 --> 01:09:57,579
think I built like four of them when we were testing it. They're all in that place. I wonder

512
01:09:57,579 --> 01:10:04,739
if I can do it from the, do we have to go dismantle them? Get rid of the poop sign. Someone said for

513
01:10:04,739 --> 01:10:09,270
me to get rid of the poop sign. Okay. Or you might have to go back to the old one. All right. Let me

514
01:10:09,270 --> 01:10:15,380
get rid of the poop sign. We'll try then. Oh, I got a small mist crystal. Hang on. I think that's

515
01:10:15,380 --> 01:10:24,260
exactly what I needed. We need more leaps and purge. You can now conjure more dragon Karakuri

516
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:33,739
here. So now I think we can do it. Maybe. I think it's not quite. I think you only have two out of

517
01:10:33,739 --> 01:10:38,970
a larger capacity. You don't have enough resources. All right. We just need to get resources. Let's,

518
01:10:38,970 --> 01:10:43,609
let's try to get our way over there then a long way. We need one more. All right. Oh wait. No,

519
01:10:43,609 --> 01:10:48,260
I can do it now. I can do it. Oh, you can. All right. Nice. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So now if you put

520
01:10:48,260 --> 01:10:52,439
it here, can you just aim it to the top of that cliff and can we just ride it up? Yeah. I'm going

521
01:10:52,439 --> 01:10:59,239
to try. There you go. So how do we make the zipline part? You know, you get on top of it and you fire

522
01:10:59,239 --> 01:11:09,079
it wherever you want. I think it's a left trigger to activate it and then you aim it and you're

523
01:11:09,079 --> 01:11:18,149
trying to get it there. And look at that. Oh my God. We did it. Why are you faster than me? You

524
01:11:18,149 --> 01:11:25,460
shouldn't be faster than me. I don't know. That's not fair. I got on it first. I think I'm starting

525
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:29,300
to understand. So there is a, okay, so there's an object limit and me placing the poop sign

526
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:34,340
meant that we couldn't place other objects. I think that's what happened. All right. Use your

527
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:43,640
sense. Make sure there's nothing here. Where the hell are we? There's a document in here.

528
01:11:45,699 --> 01:11:53,619
We went, where do we go? There's a lot of stuff here. Oh, this way. Oh, look. There it is. There

529
01:11:53,619 --> 01:11:58,699
are all of our stupid things that we placed. You can see them? I can see them on the mini map,

530
01:11:58,699 --> 01:12:05,689
like on the actual map map. Yeah. Well, it's all right. Like on the, on the map, like if you press

531
01:12:05,689 --> 01:12:12,739
select, yeah, you can see where we, yeah, I see them. That's funny though that they're permanent.

532
01:12:12,739 --> 01:12:19,130
All right. So now where is this monster? Find out what the creature made the roar.

533
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:25,180
I think if you hold your senses, we were being guided in this direction.

534
01:12:31,609 --> 01:12:38,840
Do the roar. I landed on the ground with such force.

535
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:47,100
Jeremy, you're going to like the view up here. Okay. Good. Oh my God. Oh, we got a Pat raid.

536
01:12:47,819 --> 01:12:59,880
What's up, Pat? Thank you. That was so violent. I want to be there too. It's not fair. You will be.

537
01:13:00,939 --> 01:13:16,039
You will be. Warthog. We'll crush it. I mean, crush it. We will. How come,

538
01:13:16,039 --> 01:13:18,760
why are people so afraid to have somebody with a funny voice as the main character?

539
01:13:22,279 --> 01:13:26,729
Like Yoda? Yeah. I mean, just like, how come the main character in video games can't,

540
01:13:26,729 --> 01:13:30,729
you know, talk like this? Why not? That's why we need more Muppet games.

541
01:13:31,529 --> 01:13:35,050
True. Seriously, like Muppet Treasure Island was a great game and everyone had that voice.

542
01:13:39,399 --> 01:13:41,800
Someone in my chat wrote, because cringe culture.

543
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:48,020
Cringe? I don't know. Funny voices is great. I made a career out of it.

544
01:13:48,579 --> 01:13:53,670
Actually, you know what people, that would get annoying. Yeah. After a while. I mean,

545
01:13:53,670 --> 01:13:59,029
but Mario has a funny voice. Someone just said, and like he goes, the whole game and we just get

546
01:13:59,029 --> 01:14:06,149
used to it. But Mario is not, Mario, you know, going like, yahoo. He's not going like, yahoo.

547
01:14:06,149 --> 01:14:10,710
And by the way, let us talk about current political landscape. Like it doesn't really,

548
01:14:11,670 --> 01:14:17,590
it doesn't really talk that way. Luigi does that. Luigi's like, oh Mario, we're going to yeet that

549
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:24,420
meat. You know, I actually really, I like that voice. I don't think I would have a problem with

550
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:28,979
that voice. I wouldn't either, you know, we're going to make it the pasta, the pizza.

551
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:34,260
Snow covers summer pastures. I like that voice.

552
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:38,899
So if we let that Kingdust think this is its patch. I don't suppose.

553
01:14:38,899 --> 01:14:44,180
Charles Martinet actually talked to people, like as Mario, like he can hold like full

554
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:49,100
conversations with people as Mario. What an absolute saint of a person, by the way.

555
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:54,619
Yeah. He's a champ. He's awesome. I met him once and he was like, it was a long convention.

556
01:14:54,619 --> 01:14:57,180
Really? He was signing for days and days and days,

557
01:14:57,180 --> 01:15:02,060
like all three days. And I met him at the very end of a day. We were both tired,

558
01:15:02,060 --> 01:15:05,979
but he was way tired. You could hear his voice was just tired and he was still doing the voices

559
01:15:05,979 --> 01:15:11,829
for me while he was signing my photo. He was like, wahoo. It's me, Mario. And he just signed and

560
01:15:11,829 --> 01:15:16,710
drew pictures all over it. And he was so nice to me. And I was like, Charles, thank you. You just,

561
01:15:16,710 --> 01:15:21,770
you just made my day. You just made my month. Really sweet guy.

562
01:15:21,770 --> 01:15:27,529
All right. We can use the tower search. Oh, that's what this does. All right. So if it's

563
01:15:27,529 --> 01:15:32,010
in the area, if you put down one of these towers, that's how it's being illuminated

564
01:15:32,010 --> 01:15:38,420
through the walls. And if we use flying, it's as flying vine, we can do surprise attacks.

565
01:15:38,420 --> 01:15:42,149
Yeah. No, he just seems like a really, really swell guy.

566
01:15:43,619 --> 01:15:48,260
Yeah. He's good. Good, good lad. So how do you want to handle this? You want to do a zipline?

567
01:15:49,699 --> 01:15:55,220
Do we have enough points to do it? I'm going to see if we can make one, but I see a little

568
01:15:56,180 --> 01:16:06,010
Jerma. Yeah. Jerma, can you get over here? Yep. All right. Nevermind. You know what?

569
01:16:07,050 --> 01:16:13,909
Probably wouldn't be good for your sponsorship. But, but here, can you, can you follow, follow me?

570
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:25,880
That was pretty fucking cool. I'm not going to lie. Okay. All right. I'm just,

571
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:28,039
Hey, name me, name me another game where you could do something like that.

572
01:16:31,180 --> 01:16:37,479
Good point. I can't write the second. Good point. Someone said Sonic 06.

573
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:46,460
That was pretty pog to me. Skyrim. All right. All right. Yeah. Well, we can zipline that dude.

574
01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:52,390
Let's do it. Let's, let's go for it. All right. Hang on. Let me see if I can do

575
01:16:52,390 --> 01:16:56,229
a zipline. Can I just jump? I cannot. I don't have enough resources.

576
01:16:57,029 --> 01:17:02,310
We, unfortunately we might need to go and like dismantle these like useless.

577
01:17:02,310 --> 01:17:11,029
I made two or three of them in the same place. Let's see. Dragon pit isn't powerful enough.

578
01:17:11,590 --> 01:17:19,640
Oh, hang on, hang on. Before we give up, let me look for, there's, there's a thing.

579
01:17:20,279 --> 01:17:26,010
There's an item you can get and then you can increase the, the amount of stuff you can place.

580
01:17:26,010 --> 01:17:32,010
Yeah. Those little pits with the purple, with the dragon pits. I think we need more of them.

581
01:17:32,010 --> 01:17:35,449
There's one down here. Is that the one we already got? So there's one over here,

582
01:17:35,449 --> 01:17:40,310
but I can't upgrade it because I don't have the material for it. Yeah. The collision.

583
01:17:41,029 --> 01:17:45,510
I don't know what's going on. Look, I'm looking. Is this actually an open world game? Can you just

584
01:17:45,510 --> 01:17:51,189
climb that stuff in the distance? I think that's accurate. I'm pretty sure it's just like a big

585
01:17:51,189 --> 01:17:58,359
open map. I think that's accurate. I think we can just kind of go up pretty much anywhere we want.

586
01:17:59,239 --> 01:18:06,199
Or maybe it's different areas that load up. You can even go into the sky. Oh, I found, oh wait

587
01:18:06,199 --> 01:18:10,840
now I found a core stone. Um, I mean, I guess we could just go down there and kill the thing.

588
01:18:11,479 --> 01:18:15,239
Is there, I wonder if we can like dismantle things in the, on the map or something.

589
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:18,760
We could just go down there. Can you dismantle things from the, from the map?

590
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:31,029
Let's just, I'm going to, let's head down there. All right. Just don't fall too far. Oh, I'm alive.

591
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:37,060
I'm good. That hurt a lot, but I'm good. Huh. I didn't take any damage from that.

592
01:18:38,970 --> 01:18:44,300
It's probably a, all right. That he's like right here. All right. Everything we learned,

593
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:48,699
everything we trained. It's time to kill this thing. Okay. Wait, dismantle this shit.

594
01:18:50,710 --> 01:18:57,829
Oh, so, so you, uh, here's how you do it. Um, right stick. So, so go into the thing and then

595
01:18:57,829 --> 01:19:04,100
right stick, click in and then you can dismantle. I think we, it has to, oh, here's another one of

596
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:14,069
these. Activate this thing. We need extra materials. Were you able to activate it? No.

597
01:19:14,069 --> 01:19:19,369
No, the host has to. Okay. That's so weird that only I can do it. I guess it is my game world,

598
01:19:19,369 --> 01:19:26,470
right? Following your game world, but yeah, I think that's probably why we sneak over. Yeah.

599
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:32,819
I don't have the materials. Someone said I have both yours and German streams open at once.

600
01:19:33,460 --> 01:19:39,539
That's a good lead. That's pretty, that's pretty cool. Yeah. Are you ready? Yeah. Let's, let's put

601
01:19:39,539 --> 01:19:44,010
some shit around the area. You know what I mean? Like I'm going to put a spring over here, like

602
01:19:44,010 --> 01:19:48,010
maybe have springs all around so we can kind of keep the monster the same, you know, put springs

603
01:19:48,010 --> 01:19:58,550
around boxes. I got springs. Okay. Got a bunch of springs. Okay. All right. Are we, are we ready?

604
01:19:58,550 --> 01:20:12,069
I'm going to aggro. Whoa, it's Roar just knocked me back. This is a two star monster. Are we in

605
01:20:12,069 --> 01:20:19,020
trouble here? We could seek assistance. I guess that's like health from randos. Shit, he almost

606
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:38,060
killed me in one hit. We're going to go hog wild. I got to get this parry down. Oh my God. And here

607
01:20:38,060 --> 01:20:55,029
we shit. Yeah, this is a problem. This thing is huge. It's very big. Look at the eyes. All of my

608
01:20:55,029 --> 01:21:01,300
tactics. There's so many eyes. Oh yeah. Oh God. It's got a lot of eyes. Oh, I don't like that.

609
01:21:01,300 --> 01:21:21,130
That's so weird. Back legs. Back legs seem to be vulnerable. That one did. It's a tree out of the

610
01:21:21,130 --> 01:21:29,779
way. We're good. Don't chat. Don't worry. We're going to put the squeeze on this hog. What? Unleash

611
01:21:29,779 --> 01:21:54,760
unleash a little bit. Got a little bit. Oh, there it is. I got one. Careful. This weapon is definitely

612
01:21:54,760 --> 01:22:02,300
for like for a master. It's not me. Yeah. I mean, I'm even struggling with this big sword.

613
01:22:03,260 --> 01:22:16,899
So I was dammit. There you go. I did some damage there. If you knew the monster patterns. Yeah.

614
01:22:17,859 --> 01:22:23,619
I think this thing is higher level than us, but we'll pay. How do you enjoy monster hunter?

615
01:22:23,619 --> 01:22:32,739
I've played a lot of monster hunter. Try three you for world rise. Sorry to just list my

616
01:22:32,739 --> 01:22:40,539
credentials, but no, it's true. I played a lot, but I don't get like I play like 100 hours of

617
01:22:40,539 --> 01:22:50,489
each game. And then I just after that I'm good. And that's like no small amount for me. Gamer

618
01:22:50,489 --> 01:22:56,819
resume. Exactly. I got it. I'm going to try to get a Perry. It's like a whack. Nope. All right.

619
01:22:56,819 --> 01:23:18,100
That's a long swing. That's a very long swing. I might have to go mall. I might have to start

620
01:23:18,899 --> 01:23:23,699
some materials. Don't forget you can attack and charge. Oh no, I know. But then the hog attacks

621
01:23:23,699 --> 01:23:35,500
me. And then I end up kind of like losing the combo. He's running LB. What's going on right now?

622
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:45,189
Wait, what? What did I just do? What did you blow? What the fuck did I just do? What did you do?

623
01:23:45,189 --> 01:23:54,180
Holy shit. I don't know. I had I went like instinct mode and I made a bulwark, a bulwark

624
01:23:54,180 --> 01:24:00,119
fusion. Cowra Courage is flashed into existence. I think that's the play for this one.

625
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:06,840
Bulwarks can fend off charging kimono use a fusion of how two rows of free crates.

626
01:24:08,810 --> 01:24:18,659
All right. Oh, you're down. Yeah. Perry, you can. Oh my God.

627
01:24:25,909 --> 01:24:30,710
I tried. I think we're dead. No, no, no. You got this. No, I'm dead. All right.

628
01:24:31,590 --> 01:24:38,439
I think this thing is this thing is a little more difficult. So we have three tries, it seems. So

629
01:24:38,439 --> 01:24:46,460
retreat. Yeah, we have to retreat and then I think run back. Oh, I'm gonna grab some of this water.

630
01:24:48,859 --> 01:25:02,199
Revival point. Yes, definitely do get. Hold on. Do we have your meat dry? It dried. I got it. I

631
01:25:02,199 --> 01:25:11,399
don't know what else to do with it. Oh, I did. I don't think I tried it properly. I'm going to try

632
01:25:11,399 --> 01:25:23,989
to let me try the other weapon. How do you eat the meat? Do you know? Or was it like auto eat

633
01:25:23,989 --> 01:25:37,930
meat? I don't think I'm going to go this way. You should upgrade your gear. I don't know if I can

634
01:25:37,930 --> 01:25:46,789
right now. Like we don't have enough materials to really upgrade gear left on D pad to eat meat.

635
01:25:46,789 --> 01:25:53,430
Oh, it is that. OK. All right. Let me let me just real quick. I just want to mess around with the

636
01:25:53,430 --> 01:26:06,859
mall. This thing is OK. While you do that, I'm going to do. Oh my God, it's huge. It's got like

637
01:26:06,859 --> 01:26:10,789
a small handle, too. I feel like this would be hard to handle. All right. Let me try it.

638
01:26:11,350 --> 01:26:17,050
Have you heard about stream squad? It makes it easier for people to watch your stream when

639
01:26:17,050 --> 01:26:24,039
you're playing with friends. No, I didn't know about that really. Jumping smash. Nice.

640
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:33,880
You're trying to fight one of if not the last boss of the map. You skipped all the one star fights

641
01:26:35,159 --> 01:26:39,560
as a chat member. I don't know how true that is, but it feels true. That felt hard.

642
01:26:46,869 --> 01:27:03,340
All right. This is this is way cooler. Stended mall held. You went straight to Ganon. Yeah,

643
01:27:03,340 --> 01:27:15,770
pretty much. There's also another Rage Tale. Oh, you can see. OK, because the towers we build

644
01:27:15,770 --> 01:27:25,399
have like radius of like where the monsters are. So, yeah, we. So wait, this is a little explosion.

645
01:27:26,729 --> 01:27:33,609
Is that what it does to this boss? You switch to Minato map. The NPCs are looking for its entire

646
01:27:33,609 --> 01:27:56,279
village. Oh, yeah, it's a telescoping handle. X, R, T, X, R, T, X, R, T, X, R, T. Come to work.

647
01:27:57,479 --> 01:28:02,649
Here. You know what? You do that and I'm going to deconstruct all this crap that I built.

648
01:28:03,609 --> 01:28:13,189
There we go. Jesus. I suggest doing this boss since you pick up side quests at the village

649
01:28:13,189 --> 01:28:28,489
after this boss. I mean, if we can, we're going to try. You got to get this down. So it's like you

650
01:28:28,489 --> 01:28:34,949
smash, then you press right trigger, then you press it again, right trigger and you press it again.

651
01:28:39,479 --> 01:28:44,949
Instant extend power smash. All right, that one's way cooler.

652
01:28:44,949 --> 01:28:56,409
Yeah, I'm just going to go resource gathering while Jerma is learning the hammer.

653
01:28:57,210 --> 01:29:09,270
Feel like I'm going to like it. All right, I think I'm ready. So what else do we have?

654
01:29:10,090 --> 01:29:16,489
We've got King Tusk. We've got King Tusk and that rat again, which could be good to upgrade our

655
01:29:16,489 --> 01:29:23,020
stuff. But I mean, it's up to you. Do you want to go for the rat and then come back to the King Tusk?

656
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:33,060
Yeah, let's let's do some resource gathering. Let's actually I'm going to go destroy all this

657
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:39,060
shit that I made over here. OK, I'll be back in two seconds. Yeah, take your time. I found the rat,

658
01:29:39,060 --> 01:29:49,420
so I'll just be there. I'm going to go delete that stuff because it's just it's sucking up resources.

659
01:29:49,979 --> 01:30:02,970
It's the fastest way to get there. I think fast travel only works to camp, but yeah,

660
01:30:02,970 --> 01:30:08,060
we'd have to like make a bunch of ziplines. It's definitely worth me going and getting rid of them.

661
01:30:08,060 --> 01:30:16,090
But I think that's only per area, like I'm almost positive it's a per area thing.

662
01:30:16,729 --> 01:30:23,689
And then like you can just go to a new area and build more, but you need to upgrade the limit.

663
01:30:23,689 --> 01:30:33,479
Chat members, can you confirm this? I think that's accurate. It seems like it's accurate.

664
01:30:35,510 --> 01:30:41,819
Something just screamed at me. I don't know what it was. Oh, I found a new ball. New ball just

665
01:30:41,819 --> 01:30:56,039
dropped almost there. You need your pits upgraded. That sounds weird when you type it like that,

666
01:30:56,039 --> 01:31:02,039
but I know what you're talking about. Oh my God, I fell. This is probably a better way to do this,

667
01:31:02,039 --> 01:31:10,300
but it's going to be more mindful of it. Dude, can you seriously climb this? Oh, what am I doing? I

668
01:31:10,300 --> 01:31:17,539
have boxes can help. Yeah, that's right. We just had the same issue and I had to build boxes the

669
01:31:17,539 --> 01:31:32,890
same time you did. I'm going to get a different area of the map. All right. Bounce, bounce, please.

670
01:31:33,529 --> 01:31:43,000
Bounce, please. It doesn't rock and whatever. I think we talked about this, but you're not going

671
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:50,380
to Boston for PAX, right? I am not. OK, right. I think we did talk about that. Sorry. Yeah,

672
01:31:50,380 --> 01:31:55,420
I haven't really been to very many conventions or meetups or anything like that in a while.

673
01:31:56,140 --> 01:32:07,529
Yeah. I'm going to kill this frog. What about TwitchCon in Vegas? Says someone. I mean, that's

674
01:32:07,529 --> 01:32:13,289
here. Yeah, that's close to you. I considered that one. I haven't been to the West Coast or

675
01:32:13,289 --> 01:32:19,449
the Middle Coast very much at all ever. The problem I have with that is last year it was

676
01:32:19,449 --> 01:32:25,050
the same time as Comic Con. And I like I like going to New York Comic Con. So I just went there

677
01:32:25,050 --> 01:32:34,699
instead. I'm going the right way. I think I am. Yeah, I'm picking up a bunch of resources to just

678
01:32:34,699 --> 01:32:41,930
anything I can find. Yeah, me too. Like I already found another upgrade area. Vinny, there's no

679
01:32:41,930 --> 01:32:47,289
coast in the middle. Yeah, it's just a bunch of fields. But like if you go south, there's like

680
01:32:47,289 --> 01:32:55,500
the Gulf of Mexico. No, I got a snail. Oh, that's the Gulf Coast. All right. I'm almost there.

681
01:32:56,630 --> 01:33:05,960
Don't fall, please. Why did I not make the thing? I'm good. How do I get up here?

682
01:33:12,659 --> 01:33:19,800
Vinny, wrong direction. Well, how do you know where I'm going? I don't know where I'm going.

683
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:25,899
Actually, I'm looking for a rat. Have you seen a rat anywhere? I am. Where is the rat? Oh,

684
01:33:25,899 --> 01:33:32,600
I found the rat. Oh, you're right. The pink icon. Oh, shit. All right. I'm coming in a minute.

685
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:49,399
I'm going to teleport back to the camp and I'll meet you there. Crystals. All right. Where are

686
01:33:49,399 --> 01:33:58,779
they? They're like behind me. I hope I'm going the right way. Yeah, this is definitely the right way.

687
01:34:05,539 --> 01:34:11,619
I have initiated rat fight. I am about to initiate the one we just did. Hold on. No,

688
01:34:11,619 --> 01:34:21,319
let me just delete this stuff. Don't fight me. Please don't hurt me. I just want to get. Oh,

689
01:34:28,279 --> 01:34:39,460
all right. Here's one. Here they are. Good, good, good, good. Oh, get off me. All right.

690
01:34:39,460 --> 01:34:44,979
I think this one's not mine. Isn't it, though? Can you not deconstruct it? Oh, yeah. There we

691
01:34:44,979 --> 01:34:53,659
go. All right. Did that free anything up? Can you look at your menu? Uh, it might. But again,

692
01:34:53,659 --> 01:34:57,979
I think it's since it's per area, I think it's it should be OK. Wherever wherever I am, I think

693
01:34:57,979 --> 01:35:03,800
is different. I'm not sure. But it might also be a limit on like the zip lines. Like, I don't know

694
01:35:04,359 --> 01:35:08,520
I don't know how this game works. I don't know. I it definitely is per area because I just deleted

695
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:16,460
them in there still there. It's definitely. All right. I'm coming to you. Yeah, I'm wailing on

696
01:35:16,460 --> 01:35:30,100
the rat. It's going great. I can figure out how you got there. How did you get over there?

697
01:35:30,100 --> 01:35:40,899
Oh, I got to go this way. You take a bite out of a bar of soap on screen. No. What? It's kind of

698
01:35:40,899 --> 01:35:45,060
unhinged. Why? Why? Why are people like, oh, yeah, yeah, that'd be so awesome if you did that.

699
01:35:45,779 --> 01:35:52,180
Oh, man, I hope you eat soap on it. Why would I eat soap for no reason? No, it's a good bit,

700
01:35:52,180 --> 01:35:57,369
streamer. Trust me. Actually, I've eaten soap at least three times before I got here today.

701
01:35:57,369 --> 01:36:02,569
All right. I need to go back to the road. You're going to kill that thing before I even get there.

702
01:36:03,529 --> 01:36:06,970
Chat, I won't even face cam. What makes you think I'm going to eat soap?

703
01:36:06,970 --> 01:36:25,270
And then it's to the left, right? OK, here we go. I was so close to unleashing my fury upon this rat.

704
01:36:25,909 --> 01:36:36,460
Am I going the right way? As long as I get the finishing blow, that's all I care about.

705
01:36:37,399 --> 01:36:40,439
You know what I noticed? You don't have to sharpen your weapons.

706
01:36:41,239 --> 01:36:50,069
No. That is a great thing to not have to do. I get why that's in the other series,

707
01:36:51,029 --> 01:36:57,659
but it's kind of nice to just fight and not think about it. OK, I'm still trying to find you.

708
01:36:58,380 --> 01:37:09,739
I think I can go this way. I can't eat anything at the moment.

709
01:37:09,739 --> 01:37:24,760
No, I see your name. I see the chef. OK, I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming.

710
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:41,270
OK, good. Good. Good. I'm almost there. I'm 200 miles away. I'm almost there. Oh, no. Oh,

711
01:37:41,270 --> 01:37:46,390
no, no, no, rat. Don't don't do it. I'm getting there. Can you see me?

712
01:37:47,029 --> 01:38:05,210
I think I can see. Was that you? I see you. I see you. All right. What's up? Yeah. Help me

713
01:38:05,210 --> 01:38:13,380
fight this rat. And then like we can use rat materials to further upgrade our weapons.

714
01:38:13,380 --> 01:38:20,020
It's going to be fucking awesome. Oh, there's a ball here. Oh, germ germ ball ball ball to be

715
01:38:20,020 --> 01:38:37,189
friend. Oh, I got one. All right. Rat. I like this town. Pretty cool. Looks good.

716
01:38:38,760 --> 01:38:53,899
How do we get over there? OK, now that was way more damage than I've ever done. Nice.

717
01:38:54,699 --> 01:39:04,359
And unleash the fucking fury upon the rat. Oh, my God. 500 damage.

718
01:39:05,319 --> 01:39:26,489
I think it's kind of like trapped in here, too. Might be. Right in the head.

719
01:39:27,529 --> 01:39:38,340
Oh, man. Did it run out? I lost it. I lost the charge. I think there's a material here. Yep.

720
01:39:43,109 --> 01:39:51,060
Got it. Cool. I'm enjoying this, actually. I think it's pretty good.

721
01:39:51,859 --> 01:39:55,979
Yeah, I think just learning how to how the mechanics work, I think are important.

722
01:39:57,020 --> 01:40:03,180
Yeah, like they're going for the like the box stuff. I get what they're doing. Like the same

723
01:40:03,180 --> 01:40:08,140
way in like rise, you can like use your bug to like go to the sky and then do an attack.

724
01:40:08,140 --> 01:40:14,539
This you just build boxes like it's once you figure out the combos and dodging, it makes sense.

725
01:40:15,579 --> 01:40:21,159
All right. This thing is inside of this room now. You know what? Yeah, fuck it. Let's you know,

726
01:40:21,159 --> 01:40:27,659
speaking of that. Oh, that would have been so awesome. You all know what I actually landed.

727
01:40:28,859 --> 01:40:36,520
Why is there a little possum down here? See that little possum friend? I think this might be

728
01:40:37,159 --> 01:40:51,880
the same species. I don't know. It looks like a little fella. Oh, again. Again. Stop running.

729
01:40:51,880 --> 01:41:04,149
It's dead. Fucking dead now. Oh, that felt good. It's all about using the springs and stuff.

730
01:41:06,229 --> 01:41:21,689
Yeah, I got to start building more springs. Let's see. Oh, nice.

731
01:41:22,409 --> 01:41:35,689
Oh, do it, please. Again. Oh, man. I had so many opportunities. I just screwed up. Yeah,

732
01:41:35,689 --> 01:41:46,470
I'm not doing the combos very well. It's like this swing. It's right trigger. Swing, right trigger.

733
01:41:46,470 --> 01:41:50,069
Swing, right trigger. This little fella part of your vocabulary now. That's been a part of

734
01:41:50,069 --> 01:41:54,630
my vocabulary for like the past decade. That's like a Carl Pilkington thing that I've just like

735
01:41:54,630 --> 01:42:07,449
said for years. Get some monkey news up in here. Little monkey news. Little fella.

736
01:42:08,329 --> 01:42:16,489
A hundred damage. Very mad. Very dead, I think. Very dead. Very dead. Nice.

737
01:42:20,460 --> 01:42:29,289
Carve it. Yeah, I always have a problem in monster hunting games like this,

738
01:42:30,170 --> 01:42:34,090
because I don't know what to play with. I always go, no, no, something else.

739
01:42:34,090 --> 01:42:37,050
Then I change and I have to relearn the whole thing. And then I go, no, something else.

740
01:42:37,130 --> 01:42:40,890
And I have to relearn the whole thing. Ah, something else. You end up sticking with something,

741
01:42:40,890 --> 01:42:46,649
though. Yeah, like I said, I have like my two, but even then I forget like which one I'm using.

742
01:42:47,210 --> 01:42:52,569
And then I'm like, oh, I'm pressing the wrong buttons. Sorry, I couldn't escape. I couldn't

743
01:42:52,569 --> 01:42:56,649
go anywhere. Good. That was a good sneeze. It was like a powerful sneeze. I like got out of the

744
01:42:56,649 --> 01:43:06,869
chair. All right. Maybe we should make some armor. Yes. I like that idea. I'm going to teleport back

745
01:43:06,869 --> 01:43:15,109
to camp, I think. Vinnie, your duck sneeze. Yeah, I do a duck sneeze. People like that.

746
01:43:15,109 --> 01:43:20,699
I just sound like a duck when I sneeze. I'm like, people like, do you do that in public?

747
01:43:20,699 --> 01:43:30,180
And my answer is I fucking try not to. Wait, we discovered it. We discovered one.

748
01:43:30,899 --> 01:43:40,170
Target kimono discovered. Oh, I see. OK. So I wonder, do you see these grayed out things?

749
01:43:41,720 --> 01:43:47,819
Yeah, those are camps or the dragon thing. Yeah, I think those are the ones that I've upgraded

750
01:43:47,899 --> 01:43:54,420
the pits. So we got to like, yeah, if we go to those and upgrade them, we can place more garbage.

751
01:43:54,420 --> 01:44:02,619
Yeah. Oh, I can actually do it from here. Really? Yeah. Yeah, I just upgraded one.

752
01:44:02,619 --> 01:44:12,899
You have to like actually see it first and then you can upgrade it. Paddle scoop. Oh,

753
01:44:12,899 --> 01:44:31,819
this is an automatic fish catcher. Let me see if I can upgrade something. Upgraded. I got a new

754
01:44:31,819 --> 01:44:46,840
thing. It's like, oh, OK, I can do this. It's an ornamental lantern. I think I'm going this way.

755
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:52,439
Oh, Jerma, collect this food when you get a chance. The dried out food. And if you press

756
01:44:52,439 --> 01:44:55,640
left on the D pad, you can use it before we fight and it'll give you a boost.

757
01:44:56,630 --> 01:45:03,880
There's also inherited skills here. I'm like putting that on. Interesting. What do you mean?

758
01:45:03,880 --> 01:45:07,159
Where's that? When you go into your weapon upgrades, you can kind of take inherited

759
01:45:07,159 --> 01:45:14,630
skills from the thing you just had. OK, that's interesting. This thing's way cooler. My magma

760
01:45:14,630 --> 01:45:31,369
hammer. Nice. I need one more Rage Tale thing and then I can get the better sword. Damn it.

761
01:45:31,930 --> 01:45:41,319
All right. I think I got this combo down. Bang, whack, bang, whack, and then wham.

762
01:45:41,319 --> 01:45:47,640
Which one's bang and which one's whack? Bang is X, whack is right trigger. OK.

763
01:45:52,060 --> 01:45:58,149
Health boost. Oh, this armor has a health boost. Are you going to play anything else today or just

764
01:45:58,149 --> 01:46:09,449
this? I think in a little bit I'll play something else. Maybe we'll see. Dark and darker ended,

765
01:46:09,449 --> 01:46:18,390
right? Yes, it did. I needed that to end because my productivity was dipping anyway. I'll wait

766
01:46:18,390 --> 01:46:21,989
like another month and a half and I'll be happy with that. That's fine. We could go kill that

767
01:46:21,989 --> 01:46:29,819
sap scourge again if you want to. Which one's that? That's the fire one that was burning

768
01:46:29,819 --> 01:46:38,229
like the whole forest down. Oh, the sap scourge. Gotcha. Yeah, yeah. We could do that. We could

769
01:46:38,789 --> 01:46:45,430
just go like explore and find things to hunt. I'm fine with that too. You know what? We could go

770
01:46:45,430 --> 01:46:52,710
like here, like that blue icon or the purple one and we can build a tower and just see what's out

771
01:46:52,710 --> 01:47:09,989
there. I'm into it. Let's go. Why did I not do that? Wild hearts. I feel like I'm going to be

772
01:47:09,989 --> 01:47:23,420
way happier with this weapon. Where's our thing that we placed? We got like a... I destroyed a

773
01:47:23,420 --> 01:47:32,840
couple of things. Do you want to just kind of explore? Yeah, maybe we'll explore it and we'll

774
01:47:32,840 --> 01:47:39,510
find... we'll go this way and maybe and then we'll just like... We'll probably run into something.

775
01:47:40,069 --> 01:47:46,470
Yeah, we'll run into something. I'll build a tower. Have you told Jerma about your pet owl yet?

776
01:47:46,470 --> 01:47:51,430
What is this pet owl stuff that people keep... What are you talking about? You got a pet owl?

777
01:47:52,229 --> 01:47:59,579
No. It's the owl's name. Flanko from the New York Zoo. Oh, right. Yeah, because there was an owl

778
01:47:59,579 --> 01:48:04,300
that escaped from the Central Park Zoo and he's just chilling in Central Park and like eating rats.

779
01:48:04,300 --> 01:48:17,689
What? Yeah. I can't wait to just magma smash. Not fair. I'm heavier than you.

780
01:48:18,329 --> 01:48:26,039
I'm heavier than you. Not fair. Oh, we went... Oh, we can go up and around, I guess.

781
01:48:26,680 --> 01:48:32,229
Vinny, tell him about the female owl plan. All right. Well, Jeremy, I don't know if you're

782
01:48:32,229 --> 01:48:39,140
interested in this information, but in order to catch the owl... No. No? All right.

783
01:48:43,109 --> 01:48:50,250
No. No, I'm just fucking around. What is it? Oh, ball here. Ball. Ball. In order to catch the owl,

784
01:48:51,779 --> 01:48:56,979
they're putting a female owl of the same species in like a little like cage and they're just going

785
01:48:56,979 --> 01:49:01,859
to like dangle it in front of the owl and hope it goes into the cage. What? I'm not even kidding.

786
01:49:02,899 --> 01:49:06,260
Like that's how they're going to catch the owl. That's the plan. Yeah, that's the plan.

787
01:49:06,979 --> 01:49:16,569
Uh-huh. What kind of plan is that? That's a good one. Hopefully it works. I hope they catch that

788
01:49:16,569 --> 01:49:23,140
owl. I read that and I was like, wait, no, that can't be real. That's like Bugs Bunny shit. I was

789
01:49:23,140 --> 01:49:28,420
going to say that that's some like Looney Tunes level of... I guess it's just put this here and

790
01:49:30,460 --> 01:49:40,170
hope it works. If it goes for it. That's it. I like the slide. All right. So we are down here.

791
01:49:40,170 --> 01:49:53,699
Maybe put a beacon up over here somewhere. Um, let us... What's that? Um, what's that creature

792
01:49:53,699 --> 01:49:59,539
over there? I think that's the King Tusk again. Yeah. Okay. Let's go this way and we'll place one.

793
01:50:00,180 --> 01:50:07,979
I'm just picking up every single thing I see. Oh, this is the one I made earlier.

794
01:50:07,979 --> 01:50:20,279
This is the useless one. Oh, yeah, that's right. Tom literally did that to Jerry. Oh, the plan.

795
01:50:20,279 --> 01:50:34,899
Yeah. Oh, we can upgrade this. Okay. You can now conjure more dragon something, something here.

796
01:50:34,899 --> 01:50:40,579
Okay. Oh, yeah, we know. Yeah, we can. Oh, wow. That's way more. We had like two before. It's 59

797
01:50:40,579 --> 01:50:53,109
now. Holy shit. That's so much better. It's good. Um, we can go. Let's see. Yeah, let's, let's go

798
01:50:53,109 --> 01:50:58,010
over this way. I'm going to build a tower and we'll, uh, we'll see if there's any monsters

799
01:50:58,090 --> 01:51:05,500
chilling. Has it got a squirrel? It's always monster hunter, but what about monster chilling?

800
01:51:05,500 --> 01:51:11,449
Like, like, why can't I just hang out? I think that's what we're doing right now.

801
01:51:11,449 --> 01:51:18,619
All right. Let's see if we can find something. Uh, I can't build it because it,

802
01:51:18,619 --> 01:51:26,500
your dragon pit isn't powerful enough. Let me, you know what? Let me just head back this way and see.

803
01:51:28,069 --> 01:51:32,149
I think we're like out of the zone. If you look at the map, see the map,

804
01:51:32,149 --> 01:51:39,000
maybe we have to be in those zones. I think that makes sense. Yeah. Let me, let me get closer to

805
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:48,180
this. If you sneak up on wild animals, you can pet them and get free resources. Oh, you actually

806
01:51:48,180 --> 01:51:56,220
can pet the animals. You can? What? You just like changed Jerma's life. Thanks chat member.

807
01:51:56,220 --> 01:52:07,140
I want to do that. Uh, no, I can't place this here. It still says the dragon pit isn't powerful

808
01:52:07,140 --> 01:52:17,859
enough. It's weird. All right. We can just go kill that pig. That's why I want to keep exploring up

809
01:52:17,859 --> 01:52:31,750
here. Let's go up here and then we'll loop around and if we don't see anything, we'll kill a pig.

810
01:52:31,750 --> 01:52:37,560
Yeah. I think the, the issue is that because you're the host, it's technically your game.

811
01:52:38,779 --> 01:52:45,770
So I can't interact with those. It's just so, so weird. I get it, but it's also really weird

812
01:52:45,770 --> 01:52:51,479
and not, not really anything in here. Nothing that I saw. Oh, there's a cool rock break.

813
01:52:52,279 --> 01:53:01,609
Yeah. There's rocks to break. Yeah. Um, this game, please. You are so close to getting it.

814
01:53:01,609 --> 01:53:07,300
You are. Just keep up the good behavior. Jerma chat. Keep up the good behavior.

815
01:53:07,939 --> 01:53:16,760
I think we got a lot more damage too. I, I'm, I now I'm not doing like four damage total,

816
01:53:16,760 --> 01:53:24,170
the whole encounter. Cool. So I'm down. I mean, we can loop back around this way and try to get

817
01:53:24,170 --> 01:53:35,380
to the hog again. Down for that. Uh, where did you go? You're there. What percentage still face cam

818
01:53:35,380 --> 01:53:44,250
you're at like 92%. Your other towers are overlapping. Well, that would make sense.

819
01:53:44,890 --> 01:53:53,270
This is a cool looking area. Yeah, this is cool. Yeah. I think,

820
01:53:53,270 --> 01:53:57,029
I think the chat member is right though. Like I built too many towers too close and,

821
01:53:57,029 --> 01:54:06,619
Oh, yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Can you pet the snail? Wait, I need to see if this is real.

822
01:54:12,170 --> 01:54:16,970
It's real. Holy shit. I just pet this weird tree creature of, of whom it's family. We've

823
01:54:16,970 --> 01:54:22,979
probably killed a couple of times. How do you do it? So you press the dodge button while standing

824
01:54:22,979 --> 01:54:30,420
still to crouch and like go stealth. And then when you get close to the creature and then you

825
01:54:30,420 --> 01:54:35,060
just pet them, it'll show you the button. I think I accidentally angered this thing.

826
01:54:36,420 --> 01:54:55,609
I hit it right in the fucking head. Yeah. It's too late to pet it. It's angry. I mean,

827
01:54:55,609 --> 01:55:02,680
I guess that's angry. It looks angry. Well, it's angry at me, not you. All right. All right.

828
01:55:03,319 --> 01:55:11,750
All right. Oh, I feel so bad. I have to leave. It's just this weird little hop.

829
01:55:12,710 --> 01:55:17,430
Listen, don't look, don't look, Jerma. I got this. Oh, what is he doing? What are you doing?

830
01:55:19,100 --> 01:55:24,630
Vinny, quick question. What's your favorite oil? Don't answer that. That's somebody from yesterday.

831
01:55:26,149 --> 01:55:34,710
What? I mean, you can answer it. I'm curious. Okay. A light olive oil to cook with or are

832
01:55:34,710 --> 01:55:41,399
you talking about like like essential oils? Because I like like lemongrass. It was a very,

833
01:55:41,399 --> 01:55:45,720
it was a very vague question yesterday and I gave pretty similar answers. So

834
01:55:46,439 --> 01:55:51,899
are you ready for the pig? Yeah, I'm ready. We're prepared. We're upgraded. Wait, I suppose.

835
01:55:52,619 --> 01:56:02,300
I wanted to pet that. Okay. It's not going to aggro until we attack it. Okay. I'm sorry. I was

836
01:56:02,300 --> 01:56:12,060
just collecting a ball. We've had the big monster. That'd be kind of funny. Yeah. Your chat is

837
01:56:12,060 --> 01:56:16,460
bleeding into mine because now they're saying honest to goodness. Let's hunt like they're just

838
01:56:16,460 --> 01:56:22,359
they're just like, I think we focus people saying focus on one of the legs. Let's focus on the back

839
01:56:22,359 --> 01:56:32,380
left leg. Okay. It's a good idea. Sure. All right. I'm gonna I'm gonna engage in three, two, one.

840
01:56:34,890 --> 01:56:53,180
Let's go loud. My goodness. 120 damage dude. I was so useless up until about 15 seconds ago.

841
01:56:59,689 --> 01:57:08,069
Nice. Nice. Nice. Get that damage. Nice. Wait, build the build the bulwark. Oh, I built it.

842
01:57:08,069 --> 01:57:29,420
Don't walk up. Okay, that was weird. It fucking worked. It did. I have a bulwark over here. No,

843
01:57:29,420 --> 01:57:45,109
yeah, I do. Oh, I'm over here. Get him to run into this. Come and get me. Pumped his head.

844
01:57:45,750 --> 01:58:12,710
Oh, what? Get that damage. Get the tail. 400 damage. One, two. God damn it. That would have

845
01:58:12,710 --> 01:58:18,789
been awesome. Yeah, same. I also at the exact same time missed my big attack. All right.

846
01:58:21,189 --> 01:58:24,470
At least we're doing damage and we know how to like play the game and stuff.

847
01:58:28,680 --> 01:58:33,399
Vinny, have you noticed that this hog has jiggle physics in its ass? Mods. Mods.

848
01:58:33,800 --> 01:58:50,569
Please remove this delinquents. Where did he go? I don't know. He's gone. I don't see him on the

849
01:58:50,569 --> 01:59:06,859
map. Oh, wait. No. Yeah. He's at the blue. Go to the blue. There it is. All right. Re-engaging.

850
01:59:07,579 --> 01:59:29,699
Bulwarking. Bulwark up. It kind of. Oh, it worked. I think maybe. I'm not sure. Big hit. Nice worked.

851
01:59:34,390 --> 01:59:39,989
Two hundred and twenty two damage. Nice. Sick. Four eighty. Four forty eight.

852
01:59:40,869 --> 01:59:46,390
Kimono weakness has become apparent in battle. Oh, I see. I see. I see. You can steal. Four

853
01:59:46,390 --> 01:59:51,510
hundred damage. Karakuri threat from. Those blue areas are their weak points and you can

854
01:59:51,510 --> 01:59:58,680
steal threat from them. Oh, grab onto with R, B and A. Then you can extract thread.

855
01:59:59,479 --> 02:00:08,310
Oh, that was pretty cool. He's got like horns now. These things like he's got like antlers.

856
02:00:10,859 --> 02:00:18,979
Like I'm on top of the thing now. That's weird. So wait, wait, wait, wait. So I can get on and

857
02:00:18,979 --> 02:00:27,029
then I can extract. Wait, wait. If you do that, you might be. I think you're distracting. Oh,

858
02:00:27,029 --> 02:00:32,149
you get like a massive abundance of materials. You exceed your limit so you can build like

859
02:00:32,149 --> 02:00:42,329
massive towers. Speaking of that. Oh, should I have no more. I got no more juice.

860
02:00:43,850 --> 02:00:53,050
Healing juice right over there. There's the flower right there. 164. Not bad. How did I

861
02:00:53,050 --> 02:01:07,060
do the spin attack before? I forget. I kind of remember how I did that. These are two. Yep.

862
02:01:10,180 --> 02:01:20,140
Oh, my God. I am dead. I can help you. Maybe I thought I was out of the range.

863
02:01:23,779 --> 02:01:28,659
Oh, my. Dude, what did you just do? I just did the bulwark. I'm going to be able to rescue you,

864
02:01:28,659 --> 02:01:39,670
I think. He just bounced around. One. Wow. MVP. I was a VIP. But you know what? That works, too.

865
02:01:41,300 --> 02:02:08,569
Oh, my God. I can't see shit. No. All right. It's almost dead. OK. I wasted a bulwark,

866
02:02:08,569 --> 02:02:18,710
but that's fine. Isn't it so crazy that oil like gives us energy? This weird goop gives us energy.

867
02:02:18,710 --> 02:02:22,069
Why is this dude in my chat? I don't know. I'm sorry. I apologize.

868
02:02:24,699 --> 02:02:29,180
Is this what was happening yesterday for you as well? Yeah, I think everybody got on this oil

869
02:02:29,180 --> 02:02:35,899
thing and I was like, OK, feel free to permanently ban that guy. No, it's OK. I understand. He just

870
02:02:35,899 --> 02:02:42,489
likes the wonders of oil, I guess. Like it it propels vehicles and like you can cook with it

871
02:02:42,489 --> 02:02:49,850
and use it like on like skin like use it. I get it. Like, I understand. I'm kind of like team oil now.

872
02:02:52,489 --> 02:02:57,449
Yes, Jerm. Oh, no, I was making so I was going hmm. Every time I touched one of these things,

873
02:03:00,060 --> 02:03:03,979
it really used these ziplines, but we're just like, let's run instead.

874
02:03:05,880 --> 02:03:12,199
In that game against the storm, I choose oil as my first boon chat. So that's weird. Ready?

875
02:03:13,300 --> 02:03:26,539
Yeah. Fast travel time. Let's go for it. Check it out. Bang. Nice. Please don't tell me you cook

876
02:03:26,539 --> 02:03:34,979
food with crude oil. Yeah, we so fucked up like you run out of oil. It's like,

877
02:03:36,010 --> 02:03:44,859
all right, I'll just grab it for my car, I guess. Oh, that hurt. I got to get on one of those crates.

878
02:03:45,500 --> 02:04:14,380
Oh, work. Do your biggest combo. Biggest combo. Unleash it now. Oh, no, that was an awful noise.

879
02:04:14,380 --> 02:04:18,220
But yeah, I'm dead. Awful noise. I didn't hear anything. I think you peaked so much that I

880
02:04:18,220 --> 02:04:31,850
didn't hear you. I have an idea. Oh, my God. Stop. I don't have enough valiant effort.

881
02:04:32,810 --> 02:04:41,130
Run, run, run. I'm dead. I'm dead. Fuck. No, I'm sorry. I tried to dodge. I didn't know where he was

882
02:04:41,130 --> 02:04:48,069
going to land. Okay. Oh, the hunt ended in failure. Shit. Oh, because each of us were like,

883
02:04:48,069 --> 02:04:54,069
we each have one life out of three. And I keep forgetting that there's no iFrames. I'm like,

884
02:04:54,069 --> 02:04:57,109
oh, just wait for the iFrames. Sorry. Hey, hey, hey, this is a tough one. It's tough.

885
02:04:57,510 --> 02:05:02,069
You know, Jeremy, we forgot to eat. I don't know why I keep calling you by your full name,

886
02:05:02,069 --> 02:05:07,960
but we forgot to eat food. It's weird because my name is Dave. I don't know why you keep saying

887
02:05:07,960 --> 02:05:13,430
that. Yeah, I could call you like Jer or something like Jerry. They call you Jerry. You could call

888
02:05:13,430 --> 02:05:21,909
me David, which is my name. David. I don't have to keep calling me. All this time. I didn't know

889
02:05:21,909 --> 02:05:26,550
that. I'm going to talk to you. I'll talk to you after the stream. Okay. You know, it's funny

890
02:05:26,550 --> 02:05:33,899
because for a long time, people were like, hello, Vinny. Is your real name Vinny? I'm like, yeah,

891
02:05:33,899 --> 02:05:43,079
no, that's it. I took some defense food. All right. That went a lot better, even though I

892
02:05:43,079 --> 02:05:51,510
kind of blew it at the end, but it's okay. Well, what about armor? We might have, let's take a look.

893
02:05:51,510 --> 02:05:55,189
We could look at all this stuff we can make. I already, I already built a bunch of armor.

894
02:05:55,189 --> 02:06:04,149
Oh, I didn't. Yeah. So I was like able to tank like a couple more hits to the face.

895
02:06:04,149 --> 02:06:11,529
This is okay. I can make one of these. Is Vinny short for Dave? Yes, it is. Actually, it's a lot

896
02:06:11,529 --> 02:06:19,720
of fire damage. I'm losing from these. These are the days I know. I know these are the daves. I know

897
02:06:19,720 --> 02:06:37,930
it hurt. I'm just going to make the just the regular gear better than what I had on. I don't

898
02:06:37,930 --> 02:06:44,489
think I want to be able to recover health for you. Chat. Do I have to bring these balls with me or

899
02:06:44,489 --> 02:06:57,060
do they just like do this automatically? I pray for you. We're at 97% face cam turning on. You

900
02:06:57,060 --> 02:07:02,069
know, close. No, they've been good. Give me one second. They've been good. I'll turn it on.

901
02:07:02,069 --> 02:07:13,350
One sec. I'm actually going to open your stream to see if you do it. Like, I feel like it's a bit

902
02:07:13,350 --> 02:07:19,399
incoming, but I don't know. What's up? Nothing. No, it's like, I'm not like joking or anything.

903
02:07:19,399 --> 02:07:31,000
I'm just turning it on for a minute. So here you go. I'm look, I'm normal. Oh, yeah, there is

904
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:39,399
normal, normal Jeremy. I'm just normal. Everyone was like, Hey, what's wrong with you? Man, I wish

905
02:07:39,399 --> 02:07:51,260
I had. I wish I had that kind of balls. Oh, wait, I do in game. The once every eight weeks

906
02:07:51,260 --> 02:07:59,100
face cam. There was a point where people saw my face once a year. Like that was like pretty much

907
02:07:59,100 --> 02:08:08,380
like for just some weird special occasion thing. I like that. It was fine. All right. I've eaten.

908
02:08:08,380 --> 02:08:18,180
I'm ready. Let me do one more thing real quick, because I want to get this down. Well,

909
02:08:18,500 --> 02:08:32,600
ah, hmm. Okay. That's jumping splash. I want to get it down. For a while. I thought V-dub was an

910
02:08:32,600 --> 02:08:37,319
actual different person chat member. That is a different person. V-dub is a different human

911
02:08:37,319 --> 02:09:05,100
being entirely thousand damage. But why was it doing that? What the hell? Okay. I think I get it.

912
02:09:05,100 --> 02:09:20,920
I get it. I get it. I'm going to try the bow for a minute. I want to see what that's like.

913
02:09:20,920 --> 02:09:32,100
Good idea. How about the timing? You got to go like swing and swing now, then swing.

914
02:09:33,539 --> 02:09:43,319
Line it up. I feel like I'm going to use this combo a lot. Arrow switch.

915
02:09:51,319 --> 02:09:57,939
This is pretty cool. Shoot. I'll tell you where the higher landed.

916
02:10:01,350 --> 02:10:06,500
Is it one single shot? Or do you do more than one? You can do a couple of different things.

917
02:10:06,500 --> 02:10:16,699
But I think, huh, is there like a switch? I see. So when you charge, you can like

918
02:10:18,470 --> 02:10:22,869
shoot the area you just shot and it does more damage and they explode the other arrows.

919
02:10:25,140 --> 02:10:28,340
Like, yeah, the arrows get stuck in there and then you can make them explode.

920
02:10:30,600 --> 02:10:40,710
It's weird. It's that seems like an omega shot. Oh my gosh. Climb crate and then

921
02:10:40,710 --> 02:10:51,909
RT mid jump. I feel like jumping off of the crates with the hammer seems like that's the way to do

922
02:10:51,909 --> 02:10:59,989
it. I'm going to only attack by jumping off and just hitting Y. Heavy attack. It's just too good.

923
02:10:59,989 --> 02:11:04,949
It's just too good. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, if you find the weapon that works

924
02:11:04,949 --> 02:11:10,840
for you, honestly, the sword was also kind of broken. So it's pretty happy about that.

925
02:11:11,800 --> 02:11:15,640
All right. But I think this bow is pretty amazing. I'm going to try this.

926
02:11:15,640 --> 02:11:19,880
I'm going to try this. Do you want to try the King Tusk again? I think we had it.

927
02:11:21,590 --> 02:11:26,310
Yeah, we had it. Let's just eat like a good hearty meal before we attack the King Tusk.

928
02:11:26,310 --> 02:11:30,779
Yeah, I had some defense food. It was pretty sick.

929
02:11:31,579 --> 02:11:34,279
Jerma, do you like grilled cheese? Oh, yeah, I love grilled cheese,

930
02:11:34,279 --> 02:11:35,880
especially when I drop it on the ground and eat it.

931
02:11:36,680 --> 02:11:40,630
Wait, that's an actual thing that's happened? Somebody said that, right?

932
02:11:41,270 --> 02:11:45,880
No, I just pulled that out of the air, dude. Like, you didn't have to tell me that embarrassing

933
02:11:45,880 --> 02:11:49,560
moment. I was literally just asking about grilled cheese, like from my no one said that.

934
02:11:52,819 --> 02:11:57,300
Sure. Yeah, I swear. What do you mean you ate it off the ground? Like David Hasselhoff?

935
02:11:57,300 --> 02:12:05,210
No. OK, in my pre stream chat today, I said that I was mess. I was joking around. I said that I

936
02:12:05,210 --> 02:12:09,130
ate a grilled cheese off the ground. And I thought that's because people talk to you about oil.

937
02:12:09,130 --> 02:12:13,590
I'm just thinking like, oh, they're going over to your stream and bringing up my shit that I do.

938
02:12:13,590 --> 02:12:18,069
I shit you not. I was just thinking about grilled cheese today because I watched like a recipe like

939
02:12:18,069 --> 02:12:22,789
Gordon Ramsay just like actually butchered grilled cheese with some like weird recipe.

940
02:12:22,789 --> 02:12:28,710
And I was just asking. Wait, is it the one where he he puts it like in a weird kettle like like a

941
02:12:28,710 --> 02:12:34,979
fireplace? Yeah. He's like, OK, we're going to use the saffron. Beautiful. There's like apples on it.

942
02:12:35,779 --> 02:12:38,899
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we're going to use this expensive cheese that doesn't even

943
02:12:39,380 --> 02:12:44,329
melt delicious. Best grilled cheese, Vinny. Let's go ahead and discuss.

944
02:12:45,369 --> 02:12:48,890
OK, I can tell you, but you tell me first, what's yours?

945
02:12:48,890 --> 02:12:53,720
So how about we both write it down and then say it at the same time out loud?

946
02:12:53,720 --> 02:13:00,840
OK, I don't need to write mine down, but. Yeah, why would we need to write it down? OK, so you go

947
02:13:00,840 --> 02:13:09,430
first. OK, it's cheddar in the bread, white bread, just simple. And then you can also put butter on

948
02:13:09,430 --> 02:13:15,430
the pan and then put cheddar on the other side. And then you can crisp the cheddar in the pan

949
02:13:15,430 --> 02:13:19,750
on the butter. And like so you have crispy grilled cheese with melty grilled cheese in the middle.

950
02:13:19,750 --> 02:13:23,260
It's amazing. Now, that sounds amazing.

951
02:13:25,260 --> 02:13:30,380
I'm going to tell you something. Have you ever have you ever used mayo instead of butter?

952
02:13:32,140 --> 02:13:42,899
No, like to cook on the pan or just in there. Mayo on the outside instead of on, you know,

953
02:13:43,460 --> 02:13:46,979
do you like butter the like the sides, right? Like you said, you put butter on one side or

954
02:13:46,979 --> 02:13:49,539
do you put butter in the pan or do you butter the bread and then put it on?

955
02:13:49,539 --> 02:13:53,779
I butter the pan and then I put the grilled cheese in there

956
02:13:53,779 --> 02:13:56,260
because it helps the cheese not stick to the pan.

957
02:13:57,670 --> 02:14:02,949
Well, I'm into the cheddar. I would say I would add a little bit of Gruyere if I were you.

958
02:14:02,949 --> 02:14:07,380
Yeah, that's what Gordon Ramsay was doing. Yeah, I don't know about that, buddy.

959
02:14:08,739 --> 02:14:11,859
If I can't say the cheese name easily, then I'm not sure I'm going to edit.

960
02:14:11,859 --> 02:14:14,500
I've never even eaten Gruyere. I don't even know what it looks like.

961
02:14:14,500 --> 02:14:17,939
OK, good. All right. Ready to go fight this big warthog?

962
02:14:18,659 --> 02:14:23,640
Yeah, I don't know where it is, though. Cheddar is good. I like Swiss, too.

963
02:14:23,640 --> 02:14:28,329
I just like love Swiss. Monster is my favorite cheese.

964
02:14:28,329 --> 02:14:31,369
Probably I've talked about this on stream. I love monster cheese and people.

965
02:14:31,369 --> 02:14:34,409
What do you mean? Monster cheese? Are you milking monsters to get it?

966
02:14:34,409 --> 02:14:39,619
I'm like, no, no, the male thing is for real. All right.

967
02:14:39,619 --> 02:14:41,779
It makes it really nice and great. Wait, let me hold on. Can I let me pet?

968
02:14:42,739 --> 02:14:49,529
You scared it, I think. Oh, here. Try that one. Try that one.

969
02:14:54,779 --> 02:14:57,100
Mayo outside of bread is life changing. Vinesauce.

970
02:14:57,100 --> 02:15:00,859
OK, you have supporters for this mayo stuff in chat.

971
02:15:00,859 --> 02:15:03,180
So I'll take you up on that. I'll give it a shot.

972
02:15:03,819 --> 02:15:09,430
It's another rat. Oh, another rat.

973
02:15:10,789 --> 02:15:16,859
Yeah, I think we're going to have to like I do. OK.

974
02:15:17,819 --> 02:15:21,819
I do really appreciate the fact that we're just in the game and we don't have to leave.

975
02:15:21,819 --> 02:15:23,180
Like, you don't have to like call me back in.

976
02:15:23,180 --> 02:15:25,579
I don't feel like a summoning thing down, like we're just in the game playing.

977
02:15:26,539 --> 02:15:29,020
Yeah. There's been no other screen.

978
02:15:29,020 --> 02:15:32,220
It's just get in the game and stay in it. Let's just kill this thing.

979
02:15:32,220 --> 02:15:35,819
Why not? It's free. It's free.

980
02:15:35,819 --> 02:15:37,020
You want to? Yeah, it's free.

981
02:15:37,020 --> 02:16:04,699
OK, that would be awesome if I hit it. I mean, it's good practice for the bow, at least.

982
02:16:05,579 --> 02:16:07,420
Yeah, maybe get the moveset down too.

983
02:16:09,539 --> 02:16:13,300
Oh, oh, yeah. It explodes the whole thing. The whole rat just exploded.

984
02:16:13,300 --> 02:16:21,130
It was amazing. I want to hit this so bad.

985
02:16:22,010 --> 02:16:36,090
Damn it. You can get that right in the head.

986
02:16:36,809 --> 02:16:50,020
Oh, my God. OK, yeah. So, Chad, here's what you do.

987
02:16:50,020 --> 02:16:53,989
You have to like shoot the rat with these explosive bolts.

988
02:16:53,989 --> 02:17:00,600
They don't do a whole lot of damage, but then you can then you can make them all explode.

989
02:17:00,600 --> 02:17:06,790
It's really cool here. So like that, like that.

990
02:17:06,790 --> 02:17:08,229
It's fucking. That was a good stagger too.

991
02:17:10,899 --> 02:17:13,540
Already got it running. Already running.

992
02:17:13,540 --> 02:17:15,459
Already running. Running. Yeah, it's running.

993
02:17:16,840 --> 02:17:18,440
Chasing. Running.

994
02:17:19,079 --> 02:17:22,280
The game's like build a tower to chase.

995
02:17:22,920 --> 02:17:24,600
Like you said before, we're just running after them.

996
02:17:26,200 --> 02:17:28,920
Vinny, what is the Lunchables tier list we were promised?

997
02:17:30,149 --> 02:17:33,110
I never talked about. I've never promised the Lunchables tier list.

998
02:17:33,110 --> 02:17:33,989
I don't know what you're talking about.

999
02:17:36,489 --> 02:17:39,530
Chad, have you had a Lunchable in your like if if you're an adult,

1000
02:17:39,530 --> 02:17:40,969
have you had a Lunchable recently?

1001
02:17:42,090 --> 02:17:44,889
Like the ham tastes like water flavored ham.

1002
02:17:44,889 --> 02:17:48,489
Like I don't it's so like like weirdly watered down ham.

1003
02:17:49,370 --> 02:17:51,770
You don't like it? No.

1004
02:17:54,090 --> 02:17:56,489
Wait, do you like Lunchables? Did I just insult you?

1005
02:17:57,209 --> 02:17:59,209
No, not that great.

1006
02:17:59,850 --> 02:18:02,809
OK, because when we were kids, it was amazing.

1007
02:18:02,809 --> 02:18:05,690
But like I had one as an adult because I was like, let me be wacky.

1008
02:18:05,690 --> 02:18:07,049
I'm like a wacky, quirky adult.

1009
02:18:08,889 --> 02:18:10,409
I'm like wacky. Like, you don't know.

1010
02:18:11,129 --> 02:18:13,770
So I'm going to try. I'm going to get like a Lunchable as an adult

1011
02:18:13,770 --> 02:18:16,090
and I'm going to try it. And it was like really disappointing.

1012
02:18:17,299 --> 02:18:18,579
Like the magic was just gone.

1013
02:18:19,719 --> 02:18:21,319
Um, the notch was good.

1014
02:18:21,319 --> 02:18:25,719
I ate, I ate a whole stack in one bite.

1015
02:18:25,719 --> 02:18:29,079
This was, um, what am I going to say, like three, four years ago?

1016
02:18:29,639 --> 02:18:31,879
Would not recommend for like a charity or something.

1017
02:18:31,879 --> 02:18:32,600
No, I just did it.

1018
02:18:33,579 --> 02:18:38,870
Oh, um, there is the thing about Lunchables, though, is

1019
02:18:40,069 --> 02:18:41,829
they're actually not that bad.

1020
02:18:42,889 --> 02:18:44,329
Look, it's it's very easy.

1021
02:18:44,329 --> 02:18:48,409
It's just look, it's just all the food groups are in there besides vegetables and fruits.

1022
02:18:49,049 --> 02:18:50,090
Um, right.

1023
02:18:50,090 --> 02:18:54,170
So meaning incredibly important, you know, um, very important, very important.

1024
02:18:54,170 --> 02:18:55,530
It's just not in there.

1025
02:18:55,530 --> 02:18:59,129
Uh, but it's, hey, if you need a snack, it's a good snack.

1026
02:18:59,129 --> 02:18:59,850
It's a good snack.

1027
02:19:00,809 --> 02:19:03,450
As a kid, though, I was like, if I eat a Lunchable, I'm good.

1028
02:19:03,450 --> 02:19:04,969
I'm getting all of my balanced diet.

1029
02:19:04,969 --> 02:19:05,370
It's fine.

1030
02:19:06,170 --> 02:19:10,979
But like what I do these days, if I'm craving that kind of thing,

1031
02:19:10,979 --> 02:19:13,459
I just get like the Hormel pepperoni and cracker meal.

1032
02:19:14,260 --> 02:19:15,379
Like that, that shit's good.

1033
02:19:16,340 --> 02:19:17,739
Yeah.

1034
02:19:17,739 --> 02:19:19,899
They make like kind of adult versions, don't they?

1035
02:19:19,899 --> 02:19:20,139
Yeah.

1036
02:19:20,139 --> 02:19:20,299
Yeah.

1037
02:19:20,299 --> 02:19:23,260
They have like adult versions and like you get like salami and like,

1038
02:19:23,260 --> 02:19:24,940
like you get like fancy cheese.

1039
02:19:24,940 --> 02:19:26,299
It's like, I like that stuff.

1040
02:19:27,260 --> 02:19:28,299
That was a good hit.

1041
02:19:29,500 --> 02:19:29,979
My mod.

1042
02:19:29,979 --> 02:19:32,459
Jeff just said rich people food, bro.

1043
02:19:32,459 --> 02:19:33,979
Bro, salami and cheese.

1044
02:19:35,100 --> 02:19:35,979
Yeah, I disagree.

1045
02:19:37,260 --> 02:19:43,690
Vinny, what's your favorite deli meat?

1046
02:19:45,559 --> 02:19:47,319
Oh, can I answer that for him?

1047
02:19:47,959 --> 02:19:48,200
Yeah.

1048
02:19:48,200 --> 02:19:48,840
Answer that.

1049
02:19:48,840 --> 02:19:49,559
Black horse ham.

1050
02:19:50,940 --> 02:19:51,739
It's good.

1051
02:19:51,739 --> 02:19:52,540
I do like that.

1052
02:19:53,100 --> 02:19:54,059
It's not my favorite.

1053
02:19:54,860 --> 02:19:56,260
Wait, what's yours?

1054
02:19:58,329 --> 02:19:58,889
Black horse ham.

1055
02:19:58,889 --> 02:19:59,690
Black horse ham.

1056
02:19:59,690 --> 02:20:00,250
Oh, all right.

1057
02:20:00,250 --> 02:20:01,690
I thought you answered for me.

1058
02:20:01,690 --> 02:20:03,129
Oh, like, yeah, I'm just speaking for you.

1059
02:20:03,129 --> 02:20:04,329
It's yours is black horse ham.

1060
02:20:05,860 --> 02:20:06,420
It is now.

1061
02:20:07,299 --> 02:20:08,100
I like deli chicken.

1062
02:20:09,479 --> 02:20:10,600
Yeah, I like that too.

1063
02:20:10,600 --> 02:20:12,120
Deli chicken slice chicken.

1064
02:20:12,120 --> 02:20:12,840
Yeah, it's good stuff.

1065
02:20:13,399 --> 02:20:14,360
I haven't had that in a while.

1066
02:20:16,090 --> 02:20:19,350
I like, I'm going to tell you, you know what?

1067
02:20:19,350 --> 02:20:22,790
Since we're talking about food, I want to tell you about a sandwich that I really like

1068
02:20:22,790 --> 02:20:26,309
that I found on the internet that I now get my deli guy to make for me.

1069
02:20:26,309 --> 02:20:27,829
I'm a huge sandwich fan, so.

1070
02:20:28,790 --> 02:20:29,110
All right.

1071
02:20:29,110 --> 02:20:29,750
Cool.

1072
02:20:29,750 --> 02:20:31,270
Because I love a good sandwich.

1073
02:20:31,270 --> 02:20:34,790
I like really good like store roast beef.

1074
02:20:34,790 --> 02:20:36,069
That's like my favorite.

1075
02:20:36,069 --> 02:20:40,629
There's like a little salt on it and it's like, like store-made, like good shit.

1076
02:20:40,629 --> 02:20:41,989
That's like perfect.

1077
02:20:42,629 --> 02:20:51,030
I'm not a huge roast beef fan, but if it's good, toasted bread, slice of fucking provolone

1078
02:20:51,030 --> 02:20:52,069
on it, let's get weird, right?

1079
02:20:52,069 --> 02:20:52,709
Love that.

1080
02:20:52,709 --> 02:20:53,350
Yeah, love that.

1081
02:20:53,989 --> 02:20:59,190
If you're ever in New York, I would take you for like the best pastrami sandwich you'd

1082
02:20:59,190 --> 02:20:59,909
ever have in your life.

1083
02:20:59,909 --> 02:21:01,190
Oh, don't say that.

1084
02:21:01,190 --> 02:21:05,270
I'll literally get on a plane tomorrow because I got some good things.

1085
02:21:05,989 --> 02:21:08,870
Yeah, I got some good places like pastrami, corned beef.

1086
02:21:09,430 --> 02:21:10,469
It's just unbelievable.

1087
02:21:12,420 --> 02:21:15,940
I'll tell you about the sandwich and maybe you'll be interested.

1088
02:21:15,940 --> 02:21:16,340
I don't know.

1089
02:21:16,340 --> 02:21:17,940
But all right.

1090
02:21:17,940 --> 02:21:24,340
Chicken cutlet with pepperoni on top and fresh mozzarella.

1091
02:21:25,219 --> 02:21:31,959
And what you do is you put that in the toaster oven for a little bit and you let the pepperoni

1092
02:21:31,959 --> 02:21:35,559
sweat onto the chicken, right?

1093
02:21:35,559 --> 02:21:41,799
You let it sweat onto the chicken and the mozzarella melts a little bit and then mustard

1094
02:21:41,799 --> 02:21:42,840
on both sides of the roll.

1095
02:21:43,399 --> 02:21:45,000
It is life-changing.

1096
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:45,719
It's so good.

1097
02:21:46,760 --> 02:21:51,479
That sounds so there's some shit YouTube chef who said he made that drunk in college

1098
02:21:52,360 --> 02:21:56,040
and he said it was like the best sandwich you ever had.

1099
02:21:56,040 --> 02:21:56,760
So I tried it.

1100
02:21:58,280 --> 02:21:59,850
It's that good.

1101
02:22:00,569 --> 02:22:03,530
There it is.

1102
02:22:04,090 --> 02:22:05,700
That sounds incredible.

1103
02:22:06,649 --> 02:22:07,530
Good job, Jerma.

1104
02:22:07,530 --> 02:22:12,329
The only problem is I'm not a huge pepperoni and salami fan.

1105
02:22:13,610 --> 02:22:17,450
Okay, so you're not into like the salted like dry meat.

1106
02:22:17,450 --> 02:22:18,250
I like it.

1107
02:22:18,250 --> 02:22:20,409
I just I don't really love it.

1108
02:22:22,700 --> 02:22:23,100
That's fair.

1109
02:22:23,100 --> 02:22:23,659
You know what it does?

1110
02:22:23,659 --> 02:22:25,899
It just gives the chicken a little extra push.

1111
02:22:25,899 --> 02:22:29,739
Like it doesn't really you don't get as you can put as much or as little pepperoni,

1112
02:22:29,739 --> 02:22:30,860
but I loved it.

1113
02:22:30,940 --> 02:22:32,379
Are you more mustard or more mayo?

1114
02:22:32,379 --> 02:22:33,979
Because I think you're more of a mayo guy.

1115
02:22:33,979 --> 02:22:34,700
I would imagine.

1116
02:22:34,700 --> 02:22:36,700
I like them both, but I'm more of a mayo guy.

1117
02:22:37,500 --> 02:22:37,819
Okay.

1118
02:22:37,819 --> 02:22:38,780
Yeah, I am too.

1119
02:22:39,659 --> 02:22:40,569
You know what?

1120
02:22:40,569 --> 02:22:42,170
You know what other kind of guy I am?

1121
02:22:42,170 --> 02:22:45,780
Kind of guy that is enjoying this experience.

1122
02:22:46,420 --> 02:22:48,420
Thank you to EA for sponsoring this stream again.

1123
02:22:49,780 --> 02:22:53,700
If you want to check it out, it's on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Series S.

1124
02:22:54,260 --> 02:22:55,829
Kind of a monster hunting game.

1125
02:22:56,469 --> 02:22:58,549
You can, you know, get materials.

1126
02:22:58,549 --> 02:22:59,030
Quite shit.

1127
02:22:59,670 --> 02:23:00,149
Pretty fun.

1128
02:23:00,950 --> 02:23:03,159
Thank you, EA again.

1129
02:23:03,799 --> 02:23:08,409
I'd like to point out that I don't have to say any of those things,

1130
02:23:08,409 --> 02:23:09,610
but I'm enjoying the game.

1131
02:23:10,889 --> 02:23:11,690
I'm enjoying it.

1132
02:23:14,379 --> 02:23:16,700
I got to find a time to come out to the East Coast.

1133
02:23:17,340 --> 02:23:18,790
Just do like an East Coast trip.

1134
02:23:19,909 --> 02:23:20,469
Yeah, you should.

1135
02:23:21,190 --> 02:23:23,350
Ross was out here not too long ago.

1136
02:23:23,350 --> 02:23:27,159
And I took him for a pizza.

1137
02:23:27,159 --> 02:23:27,959
I took him.

1138
02:23:27,959 --> 02:23:29,639
We had some cool, cool stuff.

1139
02:23:29,639 --> 02:23:30,520
Good meals and stuff.

1140
02:23:30,520 --> 02:23:30,920
It's fun.

1141
02:23:32,219 --> 02:23:33,500
Kraken was here a couple.

1142
02:23:34,219 --> 02:23:36,540
Kraken was here around the holidays.

1143
02:23:36,540 --> 02:23:38,540
And we got some some noodles and stuff.

1144
02:23:38,540 --> 02:23:39,420
And yeah, it was fun.

1145
02:23:40,739 --> 02:23:42,899
I could go for some New York pizza.

1146
02:23:42,899 --> 02:23:43,299
I'll tell you.

1147
02:23:43,299 --> 02:23:46,950
That's like my favorite style.

1148
02:23:46,950 --> 02:23:49,350
Well, I know the spots.

1149
02:23:49,989 --> 02:23:52,120
Oh, I bet you do.

1150
02:23:52,120 --> 02:23:53,239
What do you got in Vegas?

1151
02:23:53,239 --> 02:23:55,239
I love pizza in Vegas.

1152
02:23:55,239 --> 02:23:55,739
Dogshit.

1153
02:23:58,569 --> 02:24:01,450
There is like no good pizza in Vegas, unfortunately.

1154
02:24:01,450 --> 02:24:04,170
There's some that are okay that I've had.

1155
02:24:05,129 --> 02:24:07,049
Vegas is not a pizza city at all.

1156
02:24:07,049 --> 02:24:07,850
This one.

1157
02:24:07,850 --> 02:24:12,780
This is a monster we've never seen, I don't think.

1158
02:24:12,780 --> 02:24:13,280
So what?

1159
02:24:14,709 --> 02:24:15,350
We'll go to it.

1160
02:24:15,350 --> 02:24:16,549
We'll check it out.

1161
02:24:16,549 --> 02:24:21,989
So what do you what in Vegas is good that like you go for on a regular occurrence?

1162
02:24:22,979 --> 02:24:26,500
Pretty much any of the sit down restaurants in Vegas are some of the best in the country.

1163
02:24:27,370 --> 02:24:29,530
You're talking about like like steakhouse type stuff?

1164
02:24:29,530 --> 02:24:32,409
Steak houses, a lot of sushi places that are like 10 out of 10.

1165
02:24:33,049 --> 02:24:33,610
Oh, shit.

1166
02:24:33,610 --> 02:24:33,930
Okay.

1167
02:24:34,569 --> 02:24:37,370
There's a lot of like amazing Korean barbecue out here.

1168
02:24:38,500 --> 02:24:41,270
Dude, I love Korean barbecue.

1169
02:24:41,270 --> 02:24:41,909
Yeah.

1170
02:24:41,909 --> 02:24:45,979
You got McDonald's?

1171
02:24:46,969 --> 02:24:47,770
We got McDonald's.

1172
02:24:47,770 --> 02:24:49,370
We got McDonald's out here.

1173
02:24:49,370 --> 02:24:50,649
Oh, nice, dude.

1174
02:24:50,649 --> 02:24:51,129
All right.

1175
02:24:51,129 --> 02:24:52,649
Is that the same monster?

1176
02:24:52,649 --> 02:24:53,530
I think it is.

1177
02:24:53,530 --> 02:24:55,270
Why is it a question mark?

1178
02:24:55,270 --> 02:24:56,549
Well, there's a Sap Scourge.

1179
02:24:56,549 --> 02:24:58,549
This might be one we've never seen before.

1180
02:24:58,549 --> 02:24:59,350
It looks weird.

1181
02:25:00,309 --> 02:25:01,190
Oh, wait, wait, it does.

1182
02:25:01,190 --> 02:25:02,870
No, no, that looks like the one.

1183
02:25:02,870 --> 02:25:03,670
I think so, yeah.

1184
02:25:03,670 --> 02:25:03,989
Yeah.

1185
02:25:03,989 --> 02:25:04,489
Let's get it.

1186
02:25:05,989 --> 02:25:06,549
Okay, hang on.

1187
02:25:06,549 --> 02:25:08,870
Let me see if I can build a wacky thing here.

1188
02:25:09,750 --> 02:25:15,770
He's just like in the village, just hanging out in here.

1189
02:25:21,590 --> 02:25:22,709
He's just chilling.

1190
02:25:22,709 --> 02:25:30,629
He's literally just hanging out in here.

1191
02:25:30,629 --> 02:25:32,309
Ask him what his McDonald's order is.

1192
02:25:32,309 --> 02:25:33,430
You won't be disappointed.

1193
02:25:34,229 --> 02:25:35,590
It's changed over the years, though.

1194
02:25:37,579 --> 02:25:37,979
Why?

1195
02:25:37,979 --> 02:25:39,579
Was that like a weird order or?

1196
02:25:39,579 --> 02:25:42,940
I used to get like two McChickens, two McDoubles,

1197
02:25:43,500 --> 02:25:45,100
a large drink, a large fry.

1198
02:25:45,100 --> 02:25:46,059
It was fucking bad.

1199
02:25:46,059 --> 02:25:46,940
It was actually bad.

1200
02:25:47,579 --> 02:25:48,940
How do you eat that much?

1201
02:25:48,940 --> 02:25:49,659
I don't know.

1202
02:25:49,659 --> 02:25:50,219
I just did.

1203
02:25:51,260 --> 02:25:51,500
Okay.

1204
02:25:51,500 --> 02:25:51,899
It was bad.

1205
02:25:54,649 --> 02:25:55,530
Are you up here?

1206
02:25:55,530 --> 02:25:56,170
Are they where?

1207
02:25:56,170 --> 02:25:56,569
I am.

1208
02:25:56,569 --> 02:25:57,049
I'm ready.

1209
02:25:57,850 --> 02:25:58,260
All right.

1210
02:25:58,260 --> 02:25:59,620
You ready to take this down?

1211
02:26:00,420 --> 02:26:01,059
Yeah.

1212
02:26:01,059 --> 02:26:02,100
Let's do it.

1213
02:26:02,100 --> 02:26:02,739
We got resources.

1214
02:26:02,739 --> 02:26:03,780
Yep, I got 12.

1215
02:26:03,780 --> 02:26:04,260
You got enough?

1216
02:26:05,059 --> 02:26:05,860
Yeah, I'm ready.

1217
02:26:05,860 --> 02:26:06,360
Let's do it.

1218
02:26:07,540 --> 02:26:13,610
Okay.

1219
02:26:13,610 --> 02:26:14,969
As soon as we find that weak point,

1220
02:26:14,969 --> 02:26:17,290
I'll be able to like shoot it directly.

1221
02:26:29,979 --> 02:26:33,270
All right.

1222
02:26:33,270 --> 02:26:33,909
That was a big hit.

1223
02:26:34,790 --> 02:26:35,989
May have exposed some flesh.

1224
02:26:50,549 --> 02:26:51,049
Two.

1225
02:26:52,389 --> 02:26:53,670
He's exposed over on this side.

1226
02:26:54,309 --> 02:26:54,549
Okay.

1227
02:26:55,110 --> 02:26:57,030
Now, Jerma, if you grab that stuff,

1228
02:26:57,030 --> 02:26:58,709
you can get a ton of materials.

1229
02:26:58,709 --> 02:26:59,270
Really?

1230
02:26:59,270 --> 02:26:59,510
All right.

1231
02:26:59,510 --> 02:26:59,909
How do we?

1232
02:26:59,909 --> 02:27:00,549
I got to try to get.

1233
02:27:01,750 --> 02:27:04,229
The run button and then just like jump onto it.

1234
02:27:04,229 --> 02:27:05,989
And then you continue grabbing

1235
02:27:05,989 --> 02:27:07,510
and then you can get all the materials.

1236
02:27:07,510 --> 02:27:08,069
It's amazing.

1237
02:27:08,069 --> 02:27:08,469
I know.

1238
02:27:08,469 --> 02:27:09,110
Face cam is on.

1239
02:27:09,110 --> 02:27:09,829
People are going to love that one.

1240
02:27:09,829 --> 02:27:10,149
Clip it.

1241
02:27:10,149 --> 02:27:10,549
I don't care.

1242
02:27:12,229 --> 02:27:12,629
All right.

1243
02:27:12,629 --> 02:27:13,750
I'm seeing materials.

1244
02:27:13,750 --> 02:27:13,989
Shit.

1245
02:27:15,110 --> 02:27:15,530
Oh, wait.

1246
02:27:15,530 --> 02:27:17,209
Has he got the glowing blue spot yet or no?

1247
02:27:17,690 --> 02:27:18,489
I got fucking magical.

1248
02:27:18,489 --> 02:27:18,809
Oh, he does.

1249
02:27:18,809 --> 02:27:19,530
He doesn't even know.

1250
02:27:20,409 --> 02:27:20,729
Okay.

1251
02:27:22,170 --> 02:27:23,450
See if I can grab some of this too.

1252
02:27:30,899 --> 02:27:33,059
Did the pig just say appreciate you?

1253
02:27:34,340 --> 02:27:35,139
What the fuck?

1254
02:27:35,700 --> 02:27:36,579
No, I don't think it did.

1255
02:27:38,020 --> 02:27:39,139
No, it did.

1256
02:27:39,139 --> 02:27:41,059
I swear to God, it did.

1257
02:27:42,020 --> 02:27:45,780
There's no way a pig spoke English.

1258
02:27:45,780 --> 02:27:46,340
It did.

1259
02:27:46,340 --> 02:27:46,979
I just did.

1260
02:27:46,979 --> 02:27:50,979
It had to have smoked English.

1261
02:27:55,620 --> 02:27:56,260
215.

1262
02:27:56,260 --> 02:27:57,139
Oh, nice hit.

1263
02:27:57,139 --> 02:27:57,620
Nice hit.

1264
02:27:58,500 --> 02:28:05,620
Big hit.

1265
02:28:06,340 --> 02:28:06,579
No.

1266
02:28:07,459 --> 02:28:12,139
Oh, come on.

1267
02:28:12,139 --> 02:28:13,260
I landed that.

1268
02:28:16,899 --> 02:28:21,239
Damn it.

1269
02:28:25,450 --> 02:28:28,500
These wash died.

1270
02:28:29,219 --> 02:28:44,170
Winging around.

1271
02:28:45,370 --> 02:28:46,090
I was so loud.

1272
02:28:46,090 --> 02:28:46,649
I'm sorry, dude.

1273
02:28:47,610 --> 02:28:48,649
I don't hear it.

1274
02:28:48,649 --> 02:28:49,129
It's being.

1275
02:28:49,770 --> 02:28:50,010
Yeah.

1276
02:28:50,010 --> 02:28:52,729
Discord is like just limiting the fuck out of that.

1277
02:28:52,729 --> 02:28:53,690
So it's not loud at all.

1278
02:28:56,739 --> 02:28:58,979
Slamming the compressor, I believe we call it in the biz.

1279
02:29:02,360 --> 02:29:03,000
We got it running.

1280
02:29:03,879 --> 02:29:05,510
Not yet.

1281
02:29:06,229 --> 02:29:06,709
Now it is.

1282
02:29:06,709 --> 02:29:07,829
There it goes.

1283
02:29:07,829 --> 02:29:09,239
All right.

1284
02:29:09,239 --> 02:29:09,799
Let's catch up.

1285
02:29:13,979 --> 02:29:14,780
It didn't go very far.

1286
02:29:16,020 --> 02:29:16,500
Not really.

1287
02:29:23,559 --> 02:29:24,280
I appreciate it.

1288
02:29:25,239 --> 02:29:26,459
Yeah.

1289
02:29:26,459 --> 02:29:27,659
It's like you hit him.

1290
02:29:27,659 --> 02:29:28,299
He's like, thank you.

1291
02:29:28,299 --> 02:29:29,340
I appreciate it.

1292
02:29:29,420 --> 02:29:31,899
His mouth moved perfectly to appreciate it.

1293
02:29:31,899 --> 02:29:33,579
It was actually very humorous.

1294
02:29:38,700 --> 02:29:41,899
People are saying that you got a lot of good Mexican food in small places.

1295
02:29:41,899 --> 02:29:42,459
Oh, yeah.

1296
02:29:42,459 --> 02:29:43,899
In Korean traditional barbecue.

1297
02:29:44,540 --> 02:29:49,260
It seems like you have everything except like good bagels and good pizza.

1298
02:29:49,260 --> 02:29:49,739
I'll tell you.

1299
02:29:50,620 --> 02:29:52,780
Sub shops and pizza places.

1300
02:29:54,459 --> 02:29:54,700
Yeah.

1301
02:29:54,700 --> 02:29:55,979
Some there are some good breakfast places,

1302
02:29:55,979 --> 02:30:00,940
but that counter serve deli counter serve subs pizza.

1303
02:30:00,940 --> 02:30:02,379
Yeah, I live for that.

1304
02:30:02,459 --> 02:30:03,420
That's my favorite food.

1305
02:30:03,420 --> 02:30:04,139
And it's not here.

1306
02:30:04,139 --> 02:30:04,540
Yeah.

1307
02:30:04,540 --> 02:30:05,979
Well, you're an East Coast guy.

1308
02:30:05,979 --> 02:30:07,739
I guess you kind of grew up with that like I did.

1309
02:30:07,739 --> 02:30:10,200
So yeah, I love that shit.

1310
02:30:10,760 --> 02:30:11,559
It's very angry.

1311
02:30:11,559 --> 02:30:12,440
Be careful.

1312
02:30:12,440 --> 02:30:12,760
Wait.

1313
02:30:15,819 --> 02:30:16,700
That was awesome.

1314
02:30:29,340 --> 02:30:29,659
Get it.

1315
02:30:30,219 --> 02:30:31,420
Oh, that was a good one.

1316
02:30:32,059 --> 02:30:47,850
It didn't look like I did any damage.

1317
02:30:50,920 --> 02:30:53,159
So we're phase three is when it is horns light up, right?

1318
02:30:53,879 --> 02:30:54,680
I think so.

1319
02:31:11,780 --> 02:31:12,020
Nice.

1320
02:31:12,020 --> 02:31:12,260
Okay.

1321
02:31:17,180 --> 02:31:17,819
Two.

1322
02:31:17,819 --> 02:31:18,299
Wait, what?

1323
02:31:19,020 --> 02:31:20,229
What do you mean to?

1324
02:31:25,850 --> 02:31:26,969
Oh, shit.

1325
02:31:26,969 --> 02:31:28,329
I don't even know if that hurt.

1326
02:31:28,329 --> 02:31:29,129
That was full, though.

1327
02:31:29,770 --> 02:31:30,569
215.

1328
02:31:30,569 --> 02:31:30,969
Okay.

1329
02:31:30,969 --> 02:31:31,850
Now I'm getting it.

1330
02:31:31,850 --> 02:31:33,129
Horns coming up.

1331
02:31:33,129 --> 02:31:36,020
This game has critical range.

1332
02:31:36,020 --> 02:31:38,819
Oh, you have to be closer to do better damage with the bow.

1333
02:31:38,819 --> 02:31:39,139
I see.

1334
02:31:40,020 --> 02:32:04,389
Oh, this dude just slammed through my bulwark or work.

1335
02:32:07,739 --> 02:32:08,940
Let's get fucking weird.

1336
02:32:08,940 --> 02:32:09,500
Watch this.

1337
02:32:09,500 --> 02:32:09,979
Oh, never mind.

1338
02:32:09,979 --> 02:32:11,020
I don't have enough resources.

1339
02:32:24,500 --> 02:32:24,739
Shit.

1340
02:32:26,549 --> 02:32:27,350
That was good.

1341
02:32:27,989 --> 02:32:28,709
That was good.

1342
02:32:29,670 --> 02:32:31,819
Seems pretty unhappy.

1343
02:32:38,069 --> 02:32:39,430
Oh, my God.

1344
02:32:39,430 --> 02:32:40,149
It's weak point.

1345
02:32:48,889 --> 02:32:49,930
Get the blue weak spot.

1346
02:32:49,930 --> 02:32:51,049
I do, but it doesn't.

1347
02:32:51,049 --> 02:32:53,530
If your crosshair is white, it won't do damage.

1348
02:32:53,530 --> 02:32:54,649
Oh, that makes sense.

1349
02:32:55,610 --> 02:32:58,659
I don't have any.

1350
02:32:58,659 --> 02:33:03,770
Oh, what?

1351
02:33:03,770 --> 02:33:05,370
What don't you have for a bulwark?

1352
02:33:05,370 --> 02:33:06,250
I was trying to do a bulwark.

1353
02:33:06,809 --> 02:33:07,049
Okay.

1354
02:33:07,049 --> 02:33:08,329
I got one up over here.

1355
02:33:09,290 --> 02:33:12,809
Get it.

1356
02:33:13,370 --> 02:33:13,850
Nice.

1357
02:33:13,850 --> 02:33:14,090
All right.

1358
02:33:14,090 --> 02:33:14,889
That was like 500.

1359
02:33:22,459 --> 02:33:23,500
I understand now, chat.

1360
02:33:23,500 --> 02:33:26,379
I was just too far away because this bow is amazing.

1361
02:33:27,100 --> 02:33:29,979
And I was wondering, like, why is this weapon so broken?

1362
02:33:29,979 --> 02:33:31,579
It's because you have to be kind of close.

1363
02:33:34,729 --> 02:33:36,729
That's why we place this shit everywhere like this.

1364
02:33:37,370 --> 02:33:38,409
Just to be able to hop around.

1365
02:33:39,610 --> 02:33:41,290
So you make a permanent route.

1366
02:33:42,250 --> 02:33:43,049
I get it.

1367
02:33:43,049 --> 02:33:43,850
I get it.

1368
02:33:43,850 --> 02:33:46,889
And then the world just changes as you continue adding stuff.

1369
02:33:46,889 --> 02:33:47,690
So that way it's like...

1370
02:33:48,489 --> 02:33:50,250
I mean, when people were saying death stranding,

1371
02:33:50,250 --> 02:33:51,610
I was like, wait, what are you talking about?

1372
02:33:51,610 --> 02:33:52,729
Now I kind of understand.

1373
02:33:52,729 --> 02:33:53,850
We have a situation over here.

1374
02:33:55,579 --> 02:33:56,700
What's that situation?

1375
02:33:56,700 --> 02:33:57,819
You'll see when we turn the corner.

1376
02:33:58,780 --> 02:34:01,159
Oh, that of the situation.

1377
02:34:02,459 --> 02:34:03,739
Yeah, the sap scourge, dude.

1378
02:34:04,379 --> 02:34:07,590
I think it's all right.

1379
02:34:07,590 --> 02:34:07,989
Keep going.

1380
02:34:07,989 --> 02:34:09,829
Yeah, I think we could just keep moving.

1381
02:34:10,469 --> 02:34:23,350
Is it a better spot for it?

1382
02:34:23,350 --> 02:34:25,590
It was an amazing shortcut, Jerma.

1383
02:34:26,469 --> 02:34:26,870
Got one?

1384
02:34:27,590 --> 02:34:27,989
Oh, yeah.

1385
02:34:29,030 --> 02:34:29,750
You got to take that.

1386
02:34:29,750 --> 02:34:32,069
It's literally right exactly where we have to be.

1387
02:34:32,870 --> 02:34:34,969
Why can I not grab this?

1388
02:34:34,969 --> 02:34:35,610
What's wrong with me?

1389
02:34:36,889 --> 02:34:39,370
You hold the run button, press A, jump into it.

1390
02:34:39,370 --> 02:34:40,329
What's going on here?

1391
02:34:40,329 --> 02:34:42,469
That was weird.

1392
02:34:43,110 --> 02:34:48,889
It was covering my health a little bit.

1393
02:34:49,450 --> 02:34:50,250
All right.

1394
02:34:50,250 --> 02:34:51,049
Let's finish it.

1395
02:34:51,770 --> 02:35:00,139
They do make these big trees.

1396
02:35:00,139 --> 02:35:00,940
It's really weird.

1397
02:35:01,659 --> 02:35:08,459
Oh, damn.

1398
02:35:09,340 --> 02:35:10,620
I just got my ass handed to me.

1399
02:35:11,340 --> 02:35:13,559
Try to get back again.

1400
02:35:14,280 --> 02:35:20,889
It's like almost some Star Wars in this music.

1401
02:35:21,610 --> 02:35:22,649
Like the Force theme.

1402
02:35:22,649 --> 02:35:23,209
It's very good.

1403
02:35:24,090 --> 02:35:26,139
It's very, like, intense.

1404
02:35:26,139 --> 02:35:26,969
It is.

1405
02:35:28,840 --> 02:35:29,079
Yes.

1406
02:35:30,469 --> 02:35:30,870
Worth it.

1407
02:35:31,510 --> 02:35:39,319
Got a bulwark?

1408
02:35:40,809 --> 02:35:41,770
Ah, don't even need it.

1409
02:35:57,180 --> 02:35:59,690
I'm running out of heals.

1410
02:36:00,329 --> 02:36:06,680
Too far.

1411
02:36:07,239 --> 02:36:08,280
Oh, no, not too bad.

1412
02:36:08,280 --> 02:36:09,399
Still did some decent damage.

1413
02:36:13,610 --> 02:36:15,610
I got a bulwark up in case we need it.

1414
02:36:16,489 --> 02:36:19,639
I'm going to run behind it.

1415
02:36:24,780 --> 02:36:25,340
Oh, you got it.

1416
02:36:25,340 --> 02:36:25,659
You got it.

1417
02:36:25,659 --> 02:36:26,620
It is now time.

1418
02:36:26,620 --> 02:36:27,340
It is now time.

1419
02:36:28,219 --> 02:36:32,809
Right in the head.

1420
02:36:32,809 --> 02:36:33,290
Right in the head.

1421
02:36:33,290 --> 02:36:33,770
Right in the head.

1422
02:36:34,649 --> 02:36:36,329
Oh, fuck.

1423
02:36:36,329 --> 02:36:36,569
Yeah.

1424
02:36:38,379 --> 02:36:40,940
Oh, that felt so good because we lost to it the first time.

1425
02:36:40,940 --> 02:36:42,379
It's like even more satisfying.

1426
02:36:44,409 --> 02:36:45,610
You can do the final blow.

1427
02:36:47,690 --> 02:36:48,170
Yeah, yeah.

1428
02:36:49,049 --> 02:36:56,329
What happened?

1429
02:36:56,329 --> 02:36:57,049
That was weird.

1430
02:36:57,049 --> 02:36:58,649
Wait, did I just destroy our tower?

1431
02:37:00,979 --> 02:37:03,379
I just like, I guess I don't know.

1432
02:37:03,379 --> 02:37:04,659
I broke a lot of buildings.

1433
02:37:04,659 --> 02:37:05,780
What happened?

1434
02:37:05,780 --> 02:37:06,340
I don't know.

1435
02:37:06,340 --> 02:37:06,659
Okay.

1436
02:37:11,239 --> 02:37:11,719
That was fun.

1437
02:37:11,719 --> 02:37:12,280
All right, great.

1438
02:37:14,809 --> 02:37:18,229
That was fun.

1439
02:37:18,790 --> 02:37:20,229
Lyco tower destroyed, yeah.

1440
02:37:21,670 --> 02:37:24,549
Charge blue-green arrows for level three for volley arrows.

1441
02:37:25,479 --> 02:37:26,520
Can you charge level three?

1442
02:37:26,520 --> 02:37:27,879
I guess you can, if you're saying I can.

1443
02:37:29,620 --> 02:37:30,739
Why did this come out, by the way?

1444
02:37:30,739 --> 02:37:31,780
This come out like today.

1445
02:37:32,420 --> 02:37:35,459
I believe last night or midnight, maybe.

1446
02:37:36,100 --> 02:37:40,659
Okay, because I was wondering, like, how do people even, like, know how to do?

1447
02:37:41,959 --> 02:37:48,010
And now I understand.

1448
02:37:48,010 --> 02:37:50,729
Tattoo that logo on your head.

1449
02:37:50,729 --> 02:38:01,139
Did you see the land retake its original form?

1450
02:38:02,299 --> 02:38:08,379
By hunting the Yamaugachs, you reversed the influence of the Kemono.

1451
02:38:08,379 --> 02:38:11,340
Minato is but a stone's throw from here.

1452
02:38:12,739 --> 02:38:14,420
You saved it from being...

1453
02:38:14,420 --> 02:38:16,180
I don't think he said the Amogus chat.

1454
02:38:19,209 --> 02:38:22,809
So I wonder if that's the first sort of, like, tutorial chapter.

1455
02:38:24,889 --> 02:38:25,850
Because I feel like at the very...

1456
02:38:25,850 --> 02:38:26,649
I think it is, chat was saying.

1457
02:38:26,649 --> 02:38:29,370
Yeah, at the end of that, I feel like I know how to play the game.

1458
02:38:29,370 --> 02:38:30,889
I feel like the guy know how to play now.

1459
02:38:30,889 --> 02:38:31,450
Like, I get it.

1460
02:38:33,610 --> 02:38:37,290
The answer you seek is woven into your soul.

1461
02:38:37,290 --> 02:38:42,040
You need only reach out and grasp it.

1462
02:38:42,040 --> 02:38:45,719
As guidance, I can give you only this.

1463
02:38:47,139 --> 02:38:50,579
Hunt, hunt the Kemono.

1464
02:38:51,139 --> 02:38:53,850
You know, with brave...

1465
02:38:53,850 --> 02:38:55,209
For a second, I was like, what's wrong with the game?

1466
02:38:55,850 --> 02:38:57,530
Oh, no, that was what was wrong with me.

1467
02:38:58,090 --> 02:38:59,610
This is impatience, is all it is.

1468
02:38:59,610 --> 02:39:00,329
Whoop, whoop, whoop.

1469
02:39:00,329 --> 02:39:04,340
Excellent.

1470
02:39:04,340 --> 02:39:04,840
What's this?

1471
02:39:05,930 --> 02:39:12,379
Uh, I don't know.

1472
02:39:12,379 --> 02:39:13,260
Back in action.

1473
02:39:15,340 --> 02:39:17,819
That tower just, like, got destroyed again.

1474
02:39:17,819 --> 02:39:18,540
Wait, what?

1475
02:39:18,540 --> 02:39:19,819
Jerma, what's happening here?

1476
02:39:20,379 --> 02:39:22,059
I'm just so strong.

1477
02:39:34,200 --> 02:39:35,239
Literally, what the fuck?

1478
02:39:38,969 --> 02:39:39,530
I think...

1479
02:39:40,250 --> 02:39:43,129
I think it doesn't want us to lose the tower,

1480
02:39:43,129 --> 02:39:45,370
but the pig is lying on top of it.

1481
02:39:46,829 --> 02:39:48,350
Can we get the pig out of here?

1482
02:39:48,350 --> 02:39:49,709
How do we move the pig?

1483
02:39:49,709 --> 02:39:51,469
He's ruining our structures.

1484
02:39:58,010 --> 02:39:59,530
It doesn't take much to amuse me.

1485
02:39:59,530 --> 02:40:00,170
I swear to God.

1486
02:40:00,170 --> 02:40:00,969
How do we delete it?

1487
02:40:01,770 --> 02:40:02,409
I don't know.

1488
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:07,200
Here, I think I know how to do it.

1489
02:40:07,200 --> 02:40:08,319
I'll try to delete it.

1490
02:40:09,120 --> 02:40:10,879
It's hog-locked.

1491
02:40:10,879 --> 02:40:13,760
Yeah, I think it's because we got the exact moment

1492
02:40:13,760 --> 02:40:17,280
when I baseball swung him into that structure,

1493
02:40:17,920 --> 02:40:19,760
and I think he's stuck inside of it.

1494
02:40:20,879 --> 02:40:22,879
That just scared the shit out of me.

1495
02:40:23,680 --> 02:40:26,090
And I didn't even, like, it didn't even look like it.

1496
02:40:26,090 --> 02:40:27,290
I didn't go like, holy shit.

1497
02:40:29,200 --> 02:40:29,840
Oh, my God.

1498
02:40:34,110 --> 02:40:34,989
Yeah, all right.

1499
02:40:34,989 --> 02:40:36,270
Well, that just keeps happening.

1500
02:40:36,270 --> 02:40:37,229
Look for dragon pits.

1501
02:40:37,229 --> 02:40:38,350
Let's look for dragon pits.

1502
02:40:38,350 --> 02:40:38,909
Over here, look.

1503
02:40:39,870 --> 02:40:43,549
Yeah, the pig is too big on top of everything.

1504
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:50,479
Okay, so then we can do this one.

1505
02:40:53,360 --> 02:40:53,600
Good.

1506
02:40:57,360 --> 02:40:58,959
Believe it or not, that was the hog that said that.

1507
02:41:00,540 --> 02:41:01,979
I want to see the clip of that.

1508
02:41:01,979 --> 02:41:02,780
I want to see the clip of that.

1509
02:41:02,780 --> 02:41:03,340
It was funny.

1510
02:41:14,780 --> 02:41:18,350
So I'm just getting the essence of each sentence, you know?

1511
02:41:20,059 --> 02:41:21,579
All right, I want to see this.

1512
02:41:21,579 --> 02:41:26,000
All right, Vinny, if you want to see the pig talk,

1513
02:41:26,799 --> 02:41:29,200
uh, open up my stream in...

1514
02:41:29,200 --> 02:41:30,639
Someone already linked the clip.

1515
02:41:30,639 --> 02:41:31,600
Oh, okay, there you go.

1516
02:41:32,399 --> 02:41:34,010
I gotta...

1517
02:41:34,010 --> 02:41:35,370
It was very humorous.

1518
02:41:35,370 --> 02:41:41,920
I gotta watch it in a second.

1519
02:41:50,479 --> 02:41:51,680
All right, I'm gonna watch it now.

1520
02:41:51,680 --> 02:41:52,399
Yeah, let's watch it.

1521
02:41:54,750 --> 02:41:55,389
Oh, my God.

1522
02:41:57,420 --> 02:41:58,379
Your face, too.

1523
02:42:01,180 --> 02:42:03,340
Did the pig just say, appreciate you?

1524
02:42:11,309 --> 02:42:12,430
It's fucking perfect.

1525
02:42:12,430 --> 02:42:13,389
It's uncanny.

1526
02:42:13,389 --> 02:42:14,110
It's like, perfect.

1527
02:42:14,270 --> 02:42:14,829
It's perfect.

1528
02:42:15,469 --> 02:42:17,549
I gotta show the chat because they really want to see it.

1529
02:42:20,299 --> 02:42:22,620
Look, and you can see, like, Jerma's reaction to it.

1530
02:42:22,620 --> 02:42:23,899
He's just, like, befuddled.

1531
02:42:27,340 --> 02:42:27,979
That was fun.

1532
02:42:33,440 --> 02:42:33,840
This is a...

1533
02:42:33,840 --> 02:42:34,719
Ooh, look at the mountain.

1534
02:42:37,079 --> 02:42:38,440
Okay, hang on, hang on.

1535
02:42:38,440 --> 02:42:41,420
That was really fucking perfect timing.

1536
02:42:41,420 --> 02:42:44,860
Okay, uh, look at the mountain.

1537
02:42:44,860 --> 02:42:45,819
There's a mountain.

1538
02:42:45,819 --> 02:42:46,620
Huge, right behind you.

1539
02:42:48,840 --> 02:42:49,319
Oh, shit.

1540
02:42:53,440 --> 02:42:56,729
Flying vine.

1541
02:42:56,729 --> 02:42:58,170
Ah, it wants us to do this.

1542
02:42:59,049 --> 02:43:01,840
What, like, to the mountain or to this place?

1543
02:43:07,500 --> 02:43:08,219
Oh, right, right.

1544
02:43:08,860 --> 02:43:12,680
Yeah, I almost missed it.

1545
02:43:13,319 --> 02:43:16,360
So now this is...

1546
02:43:16,360 --> 02:43:18,600
I think we're opening up the hub world or something, right?

1547
02:43:18,600 --> 02:43:19,479
That's what it seems like.

1548
02:43:20,760 --> 02:43:21,159
Oh, yeah.

1549
02:43:23,020 --> 02:43:24,379
Yeah, I think this is the big town.

1550
02:43:26,239 --> 02:43:28,350
Appreciate it.

1551
02:43:28,350 --> 02:43:29,469
Appreciate it.

1552
02:43:29,469 --> 02:43:30,670
I gotta watch it one more time.

1553
02:43:31,389 --> 02:43:32,280
Just one...

1554
02:43:32,280 --> 02:43:33,879
I promise one more, and that's it.

1555
02:43:33,879 --> 02:43:35,079
Like, it was...

1556
02:43:35,079 --> 02:43:36,120
It's perfect.

1557
02:43:36,120 --> 02:43:37,639
It's actually, like, kind of perfect.

1558
02:43:47,200 --> 02:43:49,360
Did the pig just say appreciate you?

1559
02:43:53,629 --> 02:43:55,819
It's...

1560
02:43:55,819 --> 02:43:56,940
I love it so much.

1561
02:43:56,940 --> 02:43:58,780
That's, like, my favorite moment of the whole day.

1562
02:43:58,780 --> 02:44:00,639
Well, we made it.

1563
02:44:00,639 --> 02:44:03,280
Someone just said that would be a good sub-graphic for a stream.

1564
02:44:04,799 --> 02:44:07,280
It's just a close-up of the pig, and I appreciate it.

1565
02:44:07,920 --> 02:44:10,879
Yeah, it even sounded like it came from the pig's direction, too.

1566
02:44:11,520 --> 02:44:11,760
Yeah.

1567
02:44:12,639 --> 02:44:18,590
Yeah, this is definitely, like, the hub world.

1568
02:44:35,610 --> 02:44:37,290
There's no bunny dongo here, chat.

1569
02:44:44,159 --> 02:44:45,760
There is bunny dongo junior, though.

1570
02:44:46,799 --> 02:44:48,959
So here's a big kicker here.

1571
02:44:52,299 --> 02:44:52,860
Yes.

1572
02:44:52,860 --> 02:44:53,500
Hold on, this is...

1573
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:55,479
What are we...

1574
02:44:55,479 --> 02:44:56,040
What is that?

1575
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:58,360
It's some kind of sack.

1576
02:44:58,360 --> 02:44:58,840
Is that the...

1577
02:44:59,479 --> 02:45:01,579
I think we carved that off of one of the monsters.

1578
02:45:01,579 --> 02:45:02,299
Off of a rat?

1579
02:45:03,180 --> 02:45:03,420
Yeah.

1580
02:45:04,059 --> 02:45:09,979
It's like those popping videos you see on the internet.

1581
02:45:11,739 --> 02:45:17,229
It's a big payout.

1582
02:45:20,120 --> 02:45:22,040
It's the scorn goal of the dong fish.

1583
02:45:29,719 --> 02:45:36,909
You weren't very good at that, apparently.

1584
02:45:46,239 --> 02:45:54,079
Don't talk during the movie.

1585
02:45:54,399 --> 02:46:01,500
Started to feel at home yet?

1586
02:46:01,500 --> 02:46:02,620
Well, good for you, then.

1587
02:46:06,860 --> 02:46:07,420
Or run.

1588
02:46:07,420 --> 02:46:08,780
Yeah, from Final Fantasy X.

1589
02:46:26,040 --> 02:46:26,920
Time to go to sleep.

1590
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:35,559
Good talk.

1591
02:46:35,559 --> 02:46:36,760
Yeah, good talk with that dude.

1592
02:46:42,860 --> 02:46:45,020
Jeremiah, are you seeing your character or my character?

1593
02:46:45,020 --> 02:46:46,459
I see your character.

1594
02:46:47,760 --> 02:46:51,020
Why do they always wear these jabroni outfits,

1595
02:46:51,020 --> 02:46:54,799
like in these monster hunting games?

1596
02:46:54,799 --> 02:46:57,680
Like, I swear to God, they have the jabroniest outfits I've ever seen.

1597
02:47:00,920 --> 02:47:02,440
New armor can now be forged.

1598
02:47:05,559 --> 02:47:06,920
Let me take a look at this area.

1599
02:47:07,479 --> 02:47:09,079
Your home is a convenient place.

1600
02:47:09,079 --> 02:47:10,760
You go, all right, so here's the kicker.

1601
02:47:10,760 --> 02:47:11,559
This was the kicker.

1602
02:47:11,559 --> 02:47:12,040
This was...

1603
02:47:12,040 --> 02:47:14,399
Here we go.

1604
02:47:14,399 --> 02:47:17,899
We are still in each other's game.

1605
02:47:17,899 --> 02:47:19,579
I can see you were literally running around across the way.

1606
02:47:19,579 --> 02:47:20,780
Oh yeah, I see the chef.

1607
02:47:20,780 --> 02:47:21,420
Yeah, there you go.

1608
02:47:21,420 --> 02:47:21,979
That's a huge...

1609
02:47:21,979 --> 02:47:24,299
Do you have a home or is this my home only?

1610
02:47:24,299 --> 02:47:25,020
Be honest.

1611
02:47:25,020 --> 02:47:25,899
That's a big deal.

1612
02:47:25,899 --> 02:47:26,540
That I don't...

1613
02:47:26,540 --> 02:47:26,860
We don't...

1614
02:47:26,860 --> 02:47:28,700
Like, oh, invite me from like something

1615
02:47:28,700 --> 02:47:29,899
and I join this thing.

1616
02:47:29,899 --> 02:47:30,940
Join off me.

1617
02:47:30,940 --> 02:47:31,819
We're just here.

1618
02:47:31,819 --> 02:47:32,700
We're just here.

1619
02:47:32,700 --> 02:47:33,180
Forever.

1620
02:47:33,180 --> 02:47:34,139
Yeah, it's convenient.

1621
02:47:34,139 --> 02:47:36,139
It's nice that we haven't had any disconnects either.

1622
02:47:36,139 --> 02:47:37,899
It's like we're just playing the game.

1623
02:47:37,899 --> 02:47:39,739
Doesn't feel like in a pain in the ass.

1624
02:47:39,739 --> 02:47:39,979
No.

1625
02:47:39,979 --> 02:47:41,979
The only thing was we just had to complete the tutorial

1626
02:47:41,979 --> 02:47:43,260
and then that was it.

1627
02:47:43,260 --> 02:47:44,620
It's like 10 minutes, 15 minutes.

1628
02:47:47,719 --> 02:47:48,920
You're welcome.

1629
02:47:48,920 --> 02:47:52,090
So we have gear to craft.

1630
02:48:04,760 --> 02:48:10,000
He's wearing like a modern day looking mask.

1631
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:10,719
What is it?

1632
02:48:10,719 --> 02:48:12,159
I'm gonna come find you.

1633
02:48:12,799 --> 02:48:14,959
Can I use this stuff here?

1634
02:48:14,959 --> 02:48:16,510
Oh, sick.

1635
02:48:17,229 --> 02:48:17,790
Oh, man.

1636
02:48:17,790 --> 02:48:19,309
You can make ornaments.

1637
02:48:20,350 --> 02:48:22,829
Okay, Vinny, I'm gonna need to do something for me.

1638
02:48:22,829 --> 02:48:24,350
Just stay right there.

1639
02:48:25,629 --> 02:48:27,950
Just turn around and look over here when I tell you.

1640
02:48:30,030 --> 02:48:31,659
Okay, go ahead and look.

1641
02:48:31,659 --> 02:48:33,100
You had the exact same idea.

1642
02:48:33,100 --> 02:48:34,780
I was about to do the same thing.

1643
02:48:34,780 --> 02:48:35,280
Yeah.

1644
02:48:36,909 --> 02:48:37,549
That's the...

1645
02:48:37,549 --> 02:48:38,750
You put this...

1646
02:48:38,750 --> 02:48:40,030
Oh my God, don't kill anybody.

1647
02:48:40,590 --> 02:48:43,290
How do I get up there though?

1648
02:48:44,559 --> 02:48:46,079
If I want to go up there,

1649
02:48:46,639 --> 02:48:47,840
I wonder if there's a way to do that.

1650
02:48:49,600 --> 02:48:50,319
Oh yeah, there is.

1651
02:48:59,340 --> 02:49:00,299
Oh, you put it in your hair.

1652
02:49:05,040 --> 02:49:07,040
We do have new materials from that pig, so...

1653
02:49:10,959 --> 02:49:11,360
Oh yeah.

1654
02:49:12,479 --> 02:49:14,479
I gotta find the forge.

1655
02:49:14,479 --> 02:49:16,000
Over by me?

1656
02:49:16,639 --> 02:49:20,350
Wait, what happens when you jump into the water?

1657
02:49:21,069 --> 02:49:23,690
Oh, you just die.

1658
02:49:23,690 --> 02:49:24,250
Cool.

1659
02:49:24,250 --> 02:49:25,370
What is that 40?

1660
02:49:26,170 --> 02:49:26,809
40 what?

1661
02:49:27,450 --> 02:49:32,510
Is that like elemental damage?

1662
02:49:32,510 --> 02:49:33,549
A 40 of OE.

1663
02:49:45,469 --> 02:49:46,110
Oh, this is...

1664
02:49:46,110 --> 02:49:46,430
Okay.

1665
02:49:48,510 --> 02:49:49,629
So that's more damage.

1666
02:49:50,190 --> 02:49:51,549
And so when it topples over,

1667
02:49:52,110 --> 02:49:55,389
I do 13% more damage if they're toppled over.

1668
02:49:55,389 --> 02:49:56,590
What is nimble fingered?

1669
02:49:59,930 --> 02:50:00,809
Oh, I can...

1670
02:50:00,809 --> 02:50:01,770
Yeah, I can do this now.

1671
02:50:01,770 --> 02:50:04,489
I can upgrade the sword.

1672
02:50:04,489 --> 02:50:04,889
Very cool.

1673
02:50:04,889 --> 02:50:05,690
Bare thread.

1674
02:50:05,690 --> 02:50:06,329
What does that do?

1675
02:50:07,739 --> 02:50:12,600
Inhibit stamina loss when Karakuri thread has run out.

1676
02:50:12,600 --> 02:50:13,100
Okay.

1677
02:50:15,840 --> 02:50:16,959
If I want to keep going down this path,

1678
02:50:16,959 --> 02:50:21,520
I need to kill the King Tusk probably a few more times.

1679
02:50:26,540 --> 02:50:29,500
You can't afford to neglect the equipment that affords you protection.

1680
02:50:29,500 --> 02:50:30,139
Armor mods?

1681
02:50:30,139 --> 02:50:32,090
Wait, wait, did I...

1682
02:50:32,090 --> 02:50:37,959
I'm not sure if I forged a new weapon or if I just put things...

1683
02:50:37,959 --> 02:50:39,559
Oh, enhance.

1684
02:50:39,559 --> 02:50:42,170
There's a button that says enhance.

1685
02:50:42,170 --> 02:50:43,340
I see.

1686
02:50:43,340 --> 02:50:44,780
Okay, now that's the next level.

1687
02:50:44,780 --> 02:50:48,780
Oh, and I can upgrade to the Creeping Vine Nodachi.

1688
02:50:48,780 --> 02:50:49,659
This is centered.

1689
02:50:49,659 --> 02:50:50,540
What does that mean?

1690
02:50:50,540 --> 02:50:53,770
That was like E3 gamer talk right there.

1691
02:50:54,729 --> 02:50:55,930
Is this centered?

1692
02:50:55,930 --> 02:50:57,129
Yeah, hold on.

1693
02:50:57,129 --> 02:50:57,770
I kind of just...

1694
02:50:57,770 --> 02:51:01,959
I glossed over everything it just told me.

1695
02:51:01,959 --> 02:51:05,260
Strong arm spirit.

1696
02:51:05,260 --> 02:51:08,620
It's like an evil meter.

1697
02:51:08,620 --> 02:51:09,180
Final blow.

1698
02:51:09,180 --> 02:51:11,020
Boost attack power against toppled kimono.

1699
02:51:11,020 --> 02:51:14,219
Boost the chance of landing critical hits for a while when Hunter's arm is activated.

1700
02:51:14,219 --> 02:51:15,180
I don't know what that is.

1701
02:51:15,180 --> 02:51:17,659
I might have just beansed it.

1702
02:51:17,659 --> 02:51:18,940
Is there an undo?

1703
02:51:18,940 --> 02:51:19,739
Oh, fuck.

1704
02:51:19,739 --> 02:51:20,239
No.

1705
02:51:23,559 --> 02:51:25,159
Used materials will be returned.

1706
02:51:25,159 --> 02:51:27,319
Oh, it's only a gold cost.

1707
02:51:27,319 --> 02:51:28,780
Yeah, that's easy.

1708
02:51:28,780 --> 02:51:29,739
No, I didn't blow it, chat.

1709
02:51:29,739 --> 02:51:31,049
It's all good.

1710
02:51:31,049 --> 02:51:32,989
You can get your materials back.

1711
02:51:32,989 --> 02:51:35,549
Oh, that's good to know.

1712
02:51:35,549 --> 02:51:38,030
So we need to talk to the person over...

1713
02:51:38,030 --> 02:51:38,750
How are you doing, by the way?

1714
02:51:38,750 --> 02:51:39,469
You good to...

1715
02:51:39,469 --> 02:51:40,909
Do you like another monster or are you good?

1716
02:51:40,909 --> 02:51:42,510
I can do one more fight.

1717
02:51:42,510 --> 02:51:43,010
Okay.

1718
02:51:43,010 --> 02:51:44,090
Do one more.

1719
02:51:44,090 --> 02:51:49,290
If you want to go kill a toppled rat or some weird slime or something.

1720
02:51:49,290 --> 02:51:55,850
Yeah, let's try to find the next monster.

1721
02:51:55,850 --> 02:51:56,729
Yeah, let's do one more.

1722
02:51:56,729 --> 02:52:04,989
This thing has a running fire swing.

1723
02:52:04,989 --> 02:52:06,190
This thing's just burning now.

1724
02:52:06,190 --> 02:52:08,350
Oh, that's the new thing I got.

1725
02:52:08,350 --> 02:52:09,389
All right, that's cool.

1726
02:52:09,389 --> 02:52:11,069
I get it.

1727
02:52:11,069 --> 02:52:12,350
So that's fire damage.

1728
02:52:12,350 --> 02:52:14,590
Of course it is.

1729
02:52:14,590 --> 02:52:18,299
Human path modification.

1730
02:52:18,299 --> 02:52:19,979
Kimono path modification.

1731
02:52:19,979 --> 02:52:24,860
Where did I shoot that thing?

1732
02:52:24,860 --> 02:52:28,379
There it is.

1733
02:52:28,379 --> 02:52:29,100
Wait a minute.

1734
02:52:29,100 --> 02:52:29,739
What's going on here?

1735
02:52:34,159 --> 02:52:36,879
We might have to climb to the roof to get on that thing that I made.

1736
02:52:37,979 --> 02:52:38,620
Okay.

1737
02:52:38,620 --> 02:52:39,420
Yeah.

1738
02:52:39,420 --> 02:52:40,620
Oh, yeah, I had to do that earlier.

1739
02:52:43,930 --> 02:52:45,770
How do you equip a different weapon?

1740
02:52:45,770 --> 02:52:46,969
Do you have to do that at the forge?

1741
02:52:48,010 --> 02:52:48,809
Change equipment.

1742
02:52:48,809 --> 02:52:53,340
So at that same lady, you can do change equipment.

1743
02:52:53,340 --> 02:52:54,219
Oh, I see.

1744
02:52:54,219 --> 02:52:54,780
Okay.

1745
02:52:54,780 --> 02:53:00,540
Someone in my chat named CostcoHotDog150, which is...

1746
02:53:00,540 --> 02:53:02,139
That's a great name, by the way.

1747
02:53:02,139 --> 02:53:06,620
Said, can you convince Jerma to drink a 40 on his stream and burp directly into his camera?

1748
02:53:09,920 --> 02:53:14,219
I mean, how would you convince me to do that?

1749
02:53:14,219 --> 02:53:15,659
I'm not going to even try.

1750
02:53:15,659 --> 02:53:20,379
You guys enjoying your dinner?

1751
02:53:20,379 --> 02:53:21,500
Not even going to try.

1752
02:53:21,500 --> 02:53:24,909
Oh, there's a ball over here.

1753
02:53:24,909 --> 02:53:31,450
No, I'm not going to drink a 40 on stream.

1754
02:53:31,450 --> 02:53:33,370
Have you ever done Edward 40 hands?

1755
02:53:33,370 --> 02:53:36,600
Do you know what that is?

1756
02:53:36,600 --> 02:53:38,959
Edward 40 hands.

1757
02:53:38,959 --> 02:53:44,079
Yeah, it's when you, like, electrical tape or duct tape two 40s to each of your hands,

1758
02:53:44,079 --> 02:53:47,440
and you can't, like, get rid of them until you drink them.

1759
02:53:48,479 --> 02:53:51,360
It's Edward 40 hands, yeah.

1760
02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:54,989
No, I'm not going to do that on stream.

1761
02:53:54,989 --> 02:53:57,690
All right, you ready to go to the new location?

1762
02:53:57,690 --> 02:53:58,569
Is that the new location?

1763
02:53:58,569 --> 02:54:01,850
I think the new location is we have to talk to this person.

1764
02:54:01,850 --> 02:54:04,110
Oh, I thought they were in the new location.

1765
02:54:04,110 --> 02:54:07,100
Yeah.

1766
02:54:07,100 --> 02:54:11,120
Wait, I think you have to do it, actually.

1767
02:54:11,120 --> 02:54:12,079
I'll do it, yeah.

1768
02:54:12,079 --> 02:54:20,600
Someone said, I heard you talking about Edward 40 hands, so I joined your stream instead.

1769
02:54:20,600 --> 02:54:21,389
That's sick.

1770
02:54:21,389 --> 02:54:22,510
You know what would be cool?

1771
02:54:22,510 --> 02:54:27,360
If everyone came to my stream and just, like, followed my stream,

1772
02:54:28,479 --> 02:54:30,079
that would be, like, that would be really cool.

1773
02:54:30,079 --> 02:54:30,719
You should do that.

1774
02:54:30,719 --> 02:54:31,360
And based.

1775
02:54:32,079 --> 02:54:32,719
And based.

1776
02:54:32,719 --> 02:54:33,520
Do it right now.

1777
02:54:33,520 --> 02:54:36,120
Even do it right.

1778
02:54:36,120 --> 02:54:38,600
I mean, there are almost 12,000 people here right now.

1779
02:54:38,600 --> 02:54:39,559
All of you better go follow.

1780
02:54:39,559 --> 02:54:40,200
No, no, no, no.

1781
02:54:40,200 --> 02:54:41,959
And you're fine right now.

1782
02:54:41,959 --> 02:54:45,979
You better do it right now.

1783
02:54:45,979 --> 02:54:46,540
What's going on?

1784
02:54:47,180 --> 02:54:50,139
I'll just have to get you to drink a 40 at some point, but it's fine.

1785
02:54:51,340 --> 02:54:55,879
It's making the bridge repairs on the old blossom trail impossible.

1786
02:54:55,879 --> 02:54:56,920
I'm already followed.

1787
02:54:58,680 --> 02:55:02,120
This is an ad for EA, but for Vinnie, I suppose so.

1788
02:55:03,159 --> 02:55:04,520
Wait, why can't it be both?

1789
02:55:04,520 --> 02:55:05,850
It can be both.

1790
02:55:10,000 --> 02:55:11,200
Carrie, request.

1791
02:55:11,840 --> 02:55:13,770
What if we talk to Toga Hime?

1792
02:55:13,770 --> 02:55:15,209
Is that he Hime or Hime?

1793
02:55:15,209 --> 02:55:16,409
I don't know how to pronounce that.

1794
02:55:16,860 --> 02:55:23,200
I don't know, because I'm not the host.

1795
02:55:23,200 --> 02:55:23,760
I can just sit here.

1796
02:55:23,760 --> 02:55:24,799
Wait, can I emote?

1797
02:55:24,799 --> 02:55:25,920
How do I do emote?

1798
02:55:25,920 --> 02:55:27,840
It probably is emote, right?

1799
02:55:27,840 --> 02:55:29,680
They're right on the D-pad.

1800
02:55:35,290 --> 02:55:37,770
Chat, I swear to God, I thought this was a person with no face.

1801
02:55:39,280 --> 02:55:44,729
Like, I thought that was their shoulders and like their head was missing.

1802
02:55:44,729 --> 02:55:45,450
Re-input.

1803
02:55:55,899 --> 02:55:56,620
OK, you are.

1804
02:56:05,420 --> 02:56:06,940
Dude, everybody just left your screen.

1805
02:56:07,579 --> 02:56:08,079
Heck!

1806
02:56:10,780 --> 02:56:15,340
Lots of cool and basic chat members that have just entered my channel.

1807
02:56:15,340 --> 02:56:15,979
Very nice.

1808
02:56:15,979 --> 02:56:16,540
Very cool.

1809
02:56:20,700 --> 02:56:23,420
I promise you, new chat members, I will not drink a 40.

1810
02:56:23,420 --> 02:56:24,540
I will not be on camera.

1811
02:56:24,540 --> 02:56:26,379
I will not eat a grilled cheese off the ground.

1812
02:56:28,159 --> 02:56:30,319
That seems like a little...

1813
02:56:32,239 --> 02:56:33,840
I don't know why you wouldn't.

1814
02:56:33,840 --> 02:56:34,719
Oh, no, you shouldn't.

1815
02:56:35,680 --> 02:56:37,600
It's not the best deal for these new viewers,

1816
02:56:37,600 --> 02:56:40,559
but I can make a funny noise once in a while.

1817
02:56:40,559 --> 02:56:41,059
Let's hear it.

1818
02:56:46,159 --> 02:56:48,159
What's your best funny noise besides that one?

1819
02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:50,559
I'll go first.

1820
02:56:51,840 --> 02:56:52,340
OK.

1821
02:57:03,149 --> 02:57:03,649
OK.

1822
02:57:04,270 --> 02:57:06,430
That just sounds like you ate a grilled cheese off the ground.

1823
02:57:07,979 --> 02:57:09,260
They are not good.

1824
02:57:09,260 --> 02:57:10,219
They're not being good.

1825
02:57:10,219 --> 02:57:11,659
Space cams should be revoked.

1826
02:57:17,389 --> 02:57:18,989
Show him the AI snake.

1827
02:57:18,989 --> 02:57:21,709
Well, there's an AI version of me like shorting out

1828
02:57:21,709 --> 02:57:24,270
and making like really bizarre like death throw noises.

1829
02:57:24,270 --> 02:57:25,389
That was a pretty funny noise.

1830
02:57:27,579 --> 02:57:29,100
I thought, OK, I got this.

1831
02:57:32,200 --> 02:57:33,959
That was really good, actually.

1832
02:57:33,959 --> 02:57:34,680
That was pretty good.

1833
02:57:38,190 --> 02:57:39,549
My name is Tinky Winky.

1834
02:57:39,549 --> 02:57:40,510
I'm a Teletubby.

1835
02:57:40,510 --> 02:57:41,229
How you doing?

1836
02:57:41,229 --> 02:57:41,729
Hey.

1837
02:57:43,399 --> 02:57:44,200
Hey, that's pretty good.

1838
02:57:44,200 --> 02:57:45,799
Which Teletubby is you?

1839
02:57:46,280 --> 02:57:49,959
I'm the one that is orange, I think.

1840
02:57:51,479 --> 02:57:52,040
That's actually.

1841
02:57:52,680 --> 02:57:53,319
Oh, my God.

1842
02:57:53,319 --> 02:57:55,959
We could start a TV show with these two fucking voices.

1843
02:57:55,959 --> 02:57:56,680
Oh, my God.

1844
02:57:58,010 --> 02:58:02,090
Hey, welcome to the funny kids programming show.

1845
02:58:02,889 --> 02:58:03,389
Yep.

1846
02:58:04,170 --> 02:58:06,489
You know, but on the paper when I make all the rules,

1847
02:58:06,489 --> 02:58:07,129
you know what I'm saying?

1848
02:58:07,129 --> 02:58:09,870
That's kind of like Peter Griffin.

1849
02:58:09,870 --> 02:58:11,469
I don't know what you're talking about, Lois.

1850
02:58:11,469 --> 02:58:14,350
I mean, I never even once sounded like Peter Griffin.

1851
02:58:14,350 --> 02:58:14,989
All right.

1852
02:58:14,989 --> 02:58:17,469
Vinny, you are not sponsored to play this.

1853
02:58:18,270 --> 02:58:22,750
But can I just commission you right now to just on my stream?

1854
02:58:22,750 --> 02:58:23,870
You can mute your stream.

1855
02:58:23,870 --> 02:58:27,229
Can you just do that but say what platforms this is on?

1856
02:58:29,100 --> 02:58:31,500
I don't know what platforms it's on.

1857
02:58:31,500 --> 02:58:36,139
It's on Xbox, X and S, PS5, and PC.

1858
02:58:37,180 --> 02:58:39,420
Just mute your stream until it only comes through my stream

1859
02:58:39,420 --> 02:58:41,100
because I have the sponsor.

1860
02:58:43,360 --> 02:58:43,860
OK.

1861
02:58:44,479 --> 02:58:47,840
So excuse me, Vinny, where could I get this if I wanted to play it?

1862
02:58:49,290 --> 02:58:50,889
Be happy to tell you, Jamer.

1863
02:58:52,010 --> 02:58:55,959
Well, it's on Xbox Series X and X.

1864
02:58:57,770 --> 02:59:01,209
It's also on PC and PlayStation 5.

1865
02:59:01,209 --> 02:59:01,850
How you doing?

1866
02:59:03,920 --> 02:59:04,959
He said what he said.

1867
02:59:04,959 --> 02:59:06,239
He already forgot.

1868
02:59:08,200 --> 02:59:09,159
No, I got it right.

1869
02:59:09,159 --> 02:59:09,879
No, you got it right.

1870
02:59:11,200 --> 02:59:12,239
No, that was good.

1871
02:59:12,239 --> 02:59:13,200
That was actually really good.

1872
02:59:13,930 --> 02:59:14,409
Thanks, man.

1873
02:59:16,090 --> 02:59:16,489
Hey, thanks.

1874
02:59:16,489 --> 02:59:17,049
Free, by the way.

1875
02:59:17,049 --> 02:59:17,770
You could have that one.

1876
02:59:17,770 --> 02:59:19,290
Yeah, that was that was free.

1877
02:59:20,170 --> 02:59:21,930
Like I said earlier, I'm just happy to be here.

1878
02:59:22,809 --> 02:59:24,090
I love playing games with you, dude.

1879
02:59:24,090 --> 02:59:25,049
It's the it's fun.

1880
02:59:25,770 --> 02:59:28,489
Yeah, I'm glad we started doing this more often.

1881
02:59:28,489 --> 02:59:28,969
Exactly.

1882
02:59:28,969 --> 02:59:30,010
It's exactly what I was going to say.

1883
02:59:34,700 --> 02:59:35,819
I appreciate you, Jerma.

1884
02:59:37,340 --> 02:59:38,219
Appreciate it.

1885
02:59:38,780 --> 02:59:43,120
Appreciate it.

1886
02:59:43,120 --> 02:59:45,600
All right, appreciate this.

1887
02:59:45,600 --> 02:59:46,719
So where are we going?

1888
02:59:48,250 --> 02:59:49,530
We got to kill one more monster.

1889
02:59:55,079 --> 02:59:56,360
Head to Spirit Island.

1890
02:59:57,309 --> 03:00:00,190
So I guess we have to find the exit.

1891
03:00:00,190 --> 03:00:01,229
Are you near the exit?

1892
03:00:01,229 --> 03:00:02,110
Can you like?

1893
03:00:02,110 --> 03:00:03,549
I don't think I can activate it.

1894
03:00:03,549 --> 03:00:05,159
I think you have to.

1895
03:00:05,159 --> 03:00:09,280
I'm very interested in this, though.

1896
03:00:09,280 --> 03:00:15,420
So the Costco hot dog person said you're one step closer to gaining his trust.

1897
03:00:15,420 --> 03:00:17,979
Like, I'm not going to have him drink a 40 for you.

1898
03:00:18,540 --> 03:00:20,540
Like, I can't force Jerma to do anything.

1899
03:00:20,540 --> 03:00:23,020
So don't like stop Costco hot dog person.

1900
03:00:23,020 --> 03:00:24,219
That's you're weird.

1901
03:00:24,219 --> 03:00:26,600
Yeah, relax.

1902
03:00:26,600 --> 03:00:27,719
Oh, dude, right here.

1903
03:00:27,719 --> 03:00:28,280
Yeah.

1904
03:00:28,280 --> 03:00:30,700
So here I'll depart us.

1905
03:00:30,700 --> 03:00:33,440
There are so many options here.

1906
03:00:33,440 --> 03:00:34,000
I don't even.

1907
03:00:35,319 --> 03:00:39,520
People are people are going to go absolutely nuts with this.

1908
03:00:39,520 --> 03:00:41,680
There's like dummies.

1909
03:00:41,680 --> 03:00:44,559
There is training dummies.

1910
03:00:44,559 --> 03:00:45,600
There's bulwarks.

1911
03:00:45,600 --> 03:00:49,600
There's there's a lot of stuff here.

1912
03:00:51,069 --> 03:00:53,850
Honestly, yeah, there's a there's a there's a ton of things.

1913
03:00:53,850 --> 03:00:54,889
This is like a trap.

1914
03:00:56,030 --> 03:00:58,829
Powerful leverage brings down a massive hammer with terrifying force.

1915
03:00:58,829 --> 03:01:01,870
A single blow can stop a kimono in its tracks and crush any horror.

1916
03:01:01,870 --> 03:01:03,629
So you can set up like little traps and stuff.

1917
03:01:03,629 --> 03:01:07,389
And this goes forever.

1918
03:01:07,389 --> 03:01:10,840
That's cool.

1919
03:01:10,840 --> 03:01:13,520
There's some this is something else to put your points into, right?

1920
03:01:13,600 --> 03:01:14,239
Sounds fun.

1921
03:01:14,239 --> 03:01:19,000
The Costco hot dogs hit different.

1922
03:01:19,000 --> 03:01:19,399
They are.

1923
03:01:19,399 --> 03:01:19,879
You know what?

1924
03:01:19,879 --> 03:01:24,079
I will say they're fine.

1925
03:01:24,079 --> 03:01:26,489
They're just cheap.

1926
03:01:26,489 --> 03:01:28,379
They're fine.

1927
03:01:28,379 --> 03:01:29,020
They're big.

1928
03:01:29,020 --> 03:01:30,479
There's nothing wrong with it.

1929
03:01:30,479 --> 03:01:31,840
No, this area is ready.

1930
03:01:32,559 --> 03:01:33,440
They're fine.

1931
03:01:33,440 --> 03:01:35,200
I like the coral.

1932
03:01:36,959 --> 03:01:38,159
Good source of bacteria.

1933
03:01:38,159 --> 03:01:39,040
That's right.

1934
03:01:39,040 --> 03:01:45,959
When your gut biome is in danger, just go get a Costco hot dog.

1935
03:01:45,959 --> 03:01:46,520
Can we swim?

1936
03:01:50,969 --> 03:01:51,610
Kind of like.

1937
03:01:51,610 --> 03:01:52,729
No, not really.

1938
03:01:52,729 --> 03:01:53,930
Wait, why would I be able to?

1939
03:01:53,930 --> 03:01:54,649
OK, never mind.

1940
03:01:55,639 --> 03:01:57,000
Yeah, the weapons are so huge.

1941
03:01:57,000 --> 03:01:58,280
They're just like weighing us to the ground.

1942
03:01:59,930 --> 03:02:00,329
Hi.

1943
03:02:00,329 --> 03:02:02,430
Ah, all right.

1944
03:02:02,430 --> 03:02:07,879
Would you agree that Bologna or like hot dog pancakes?

1945
03:02:07,879 --> 03:02:10,600
Jerma, I think we've reached the point of no return for stupidity

1946
03:02:10,600 --> 03:02:12,600
and I can't stop reading these chat messages.

1947
03:02:12,600 --> 03:02:13,239
No, go for it.

1948
03:02:13,879 --> 03:02:16,680
I have the choice not to read these and I can't stop myself.

1949
03:02:17,420 --> 03:02:20,459
Welcome to every single day of my life.

1950
03:02:21,579 --> 03:02:24,059
I look over and it's just somebody will just say something

1951
03:02:24,059 --> 03:02:28,280
that's just so just so strange that I have to address it.

1952
03:02:29,079 --> 03:02:29,879
Exactly.

1953
03:02:29,879 --> 03:02:33,879
Yeah, that's like one of the reasons Jerma and I even know each other chat

1954
03:02:33,879 --> 03:02:38,250
is because like our chats ended up being kind of similar

1955
03:02:38,250 --> 03:02:41,850
and people started noticing like just the weird like the weirdness.

1956
03:02:43,549 --> 03:02:44,909
Yeah, it was a meme friendship.

1957
03:02:44,909 --> 03:02:45,229
Yeah.

1958
03:02:45,229 --> 03:02:49,530
But at the same time, there is like some commonality to the to the way the chat.

1959
03:02:49,530 --> 03:02:52,250
I mean, I mean, we have demographics.

1960
03:02:52,969 --> 03:02:55,920
Vinny, I'm sure you've looked at this or there's overlap.

1961
03:02:55,920 --> 03:02:59,520
Yeah, I think as of two or three, four years ago,

1962
03:02:59,520 --> 03:03:04,000
I think you and I have shared like 30 percent of our audience together.

1963
03:03:04,639 --> 03:03:06,559
Something makes about like 40 percent.

1964
03:03:08,600 --> 03:03:09,159
It's interesting.

1965
03:03:12,299 --> 03:03:16,780
Weird, weird dudes the same age that make weird scenarios.

1966
03:03:16,780 --> 03:03:23,069
However, I will say, though, Jerma, don't get used to this, but to compliment you,

1967
03:03:24,879 --> 03:03:30,620
you do put a lot of effort into your bits.

1968
03:03:30,620 --> 03:03:31,100
I don't.

1969
03:03:31,100 --> 03:03:31,659
Thank you.

1970
03:03:31,659 --> 03:03:32,299
Yeah, you do.

1971
03:03:32,299 --> 03:03:33,020
I whipped cream.

1972
03:03:33,579 --> 03:03:36,920
Jerma, I have whipped creamed an alien.

1973
03:03:36,920 --> 03:03:38,760
That's that's as far as I'll go for a bit.

1974
03:03:38,760 --> 03:03:40,360
I'll whip cream an alien.

1975
03:03:40,360 --> 03:03:40,840
That's it.

1976
03:03:40,840 --> 03:03:45,659
Can we just talk about how pretty this area actually is?

1977
03:03:45,659 --> 03:03:46,459
I love this place.

1978
03:03:46,459 --> 03:03:46,780
I love this.

1979
03:03:46,780 --> 03:03:47,739
I love the beach.

1980
03:03:47,739 --> 03:03:48,909
This looks awesome.

1981
03:03:48,909 --> 03:03:50,989
This is like Chrono Cross, like one of my favorite games.

1982
03:03:50,989 --> 03:03:51,469
Wow.

1983
03:03:51,469 --> 03:03:52,750
That kind of holy shit.

1984
03:03:52,750 --> 03:03:55,280
You just unlocked a memory in my head.

1985
03:03:55,280 --> 03:03:55,920
Yeah.

1986
03:03:55,920 --> 03:03:59,739
That looks like I was wondering.

1987
03:03:59,739 --> 03:04:00,379
Yeah.

1988
03:04:00,379 --> 03:04:00,799
Yeah.

1989
03:04:00,799 --> 03:04:04,000
That game is got like some pretty areas.

1990
03:04:04,000 --> 03:04:05,040
Watch this.

1991
03:04:05,040 --> 03:04:06,510
Check this out.

1992
03:04:06,510 --> 03:04:10,760
Let's explore over here.

1993
03:04:10,760 --> 03:04:11,479
Sounds good.

1994
03:04:11,479 --> 03:04:13,930
Let's go up.

1995
03:04:13,930 --> 03:04:16,440
Why not?

1996
03:04:24,959 --> 03:04:25,680
Oh, you can.

1997
03:04:25,680 --> 03:04:28,319
You can stop mid midway.

1998
03:04:28,319 --> 03:04:30,040
Like you don't have to keep going.

1999
03:04:30,040 --> 03:04:31,719
Like you could just slow down and stuff.

2000
03:04:31,719 --> 03:04:33,469
I did it on purpose.

2001
03:04:36,440 --> 03:04:41,100
OK, we put one of those under towers.

2002
03:04:41,100 --> 03:04:42,219
Yeah, I could do that.

2003
03:04:42,219 --> 03:04:43,100
I'll throw here.

2004
03:04:43,100 --> 03:04:43,500
You know what?

2005
03:04:43,500 --> 03:04:44,860
Let me fake.

2006
03:04:44,860 --> 03:04:50,090
Was it the whole that gave it away?

2007
03:04:50,829 --> 03:04:52,430
No, it's three presentation, dude.

2008
03:04:53,229 --> 03:04:53,950
Dog.

2009
03:04:53,950 --> 03:04:55,790
I couldn't decide between dude or dog.

2010
03:04:55,790 --> 03:04:56,350
So I said dog.

2011
03:04:57,600 --> 03:04:58,399
I can put one over here.

2012
03:05:03,690 --> 03:05:04,190
Search.

2013
03:05:06,120 --> 03:05:06,760
Oh, that's right.

2014
03:05:06,760 --> 03:05:08,280
We had we gave Jerma a dog.

2015
03:05:08,280 --> 03:05:08,680
Sona.

2016
03:05:08,680 --> 03:05:09,479
I forgot about that.

2017
03:05:10,200 --> 03:05:11,239
Hey, we all got one.

2018
03:05:11,799 --> 03:05:13,079
Yeah, we all got one.

2019
03:05:13,079 --> 03:05:14,280
I don't see anything from here.

2020
03:05:16,809 --> 03:05:19,610
OK, I'm going to place a tower in the middle here and hope for the.

2021
03:05:19,610 --> 03:05:23,719
Oh, Vinnie, open your mouth.

2022
03:05:23,719 --> 03:05:28,379
That circle is the range of this tower.

2023
03:05:28,379 --> 03:05:31,100
So there is no monster in this circle.

2024
03:05:31,100 --> 03:05:32,909
We're going to have to keep going.

2025
03:05:32,909 --> 03:05:33,229
Yes.

2026
03:05:33,959 --> 03:05:37,440
Took me a while to figure that out.

2027
03:05:37,440 --> 03:05:38,239
I'll be honest.

2028
03:05:38,239 --> 03:05:42,559
I think I knew that, but I was not putting it into like a like active effect.

2029
03:05:42,799 --> 03:05:45,760
I was just like hiding the information for some reason.

2030
03:05:45,760 --> 03:05:47,920
But can you pet the sea animals?

2031
03:05:47,920 --> 03:05:54,989
You can pet the turtle.

2032
03:05:54,989 --> 03:05:55,870
That's cute.

2033
03:05:55,870 --> 03:05:56,750
Wait, he dropped it.

2034
03:05:56,750 --> 03:05:58,909
He gave me an item because I was nice.

2035
03:05:58,909 --> 03:06:00,670
Yeah, they do that when you pet them.

2036
03:06:00,670 --> 03:06:06,329
What about the crab?

2037
03:06:06,329 --> 03:06:09,719
I can even pet the crab.

2038
03:06:09,719 --> 03:06:15,719
I don't think they feel it like crabs wouldn't like even know what that is.

2039
03:06:16,590 --> 03:06:22,219
Oh, he's not very happy.

2040
03:06:22,219 --> 03:06:30,700
Jerma, I found like a cool pirate ship and there's like a monster on top of it.

2041
03:06:30,700 --> 03:06:31,690
All right.

2042
03:06:31,690 --> 03:06:32,250
I'm coming.

2043
03:06:32,250 --> 03:06:41,549
My character is going to puke.

2044
03:06:41,549 --> 03:06:41,709
All right.

2045
03:06:41,709 --> 03:06:42,110
I'm coming.

2046
03:06:44,719 --> 03:06:55,149
So you are all the way back there.

2047
03:06:57,040 --> 03:06:57,280
Yeah.

2048
03:06:57,280 --> 03:07:00,239
And I found a really strange looking monster.

2049
03:07:00,239 --> 03:07:05,389
I'm coming.

2050
03:07:05,389 --> 03:07:10,239
Wait, let me get some thread.

2051
03:07:10,239 --> 03:07:19,920
Just sounds like flipper.

2052
03:07:20,639 --> 03:07:22,159
Chad, you know, you hear that?

2053
03:07:22,159 --> 03:07:27,040
This monster conjure a torch to engulf your weapon in flames when you attack.

2054
03:07:27,040 --> 03:07:28,399
I think I just picked up something to do that.

2055
03:07:29,040 --> 03:07:29,520
Oh, wow.

2056
03:07:30,159 --> 03:07:30,479
Okay.

2057
03:07:37,020 --> 03:07:44,620
Oh, Suno Bashiri.

2058
03:07:45,260 --> 03:07:47,049
Are we doing this?

2059
03:07:48,719 --> 03:07:50,159
I'm fighting this one over here.

2060
03:07:50,159 --> 03:07:50,559
I don't know.

2061
03:07:51,520 --> 03:07:53,200
This thing is going for it.

2062
03:07:53,200 --> 03:07:55,120
Yeah, it's really fast and it sounds like flipper.

2063
03:08:10,360 --> 03:08:11,000
Yeah, this thing's quick.

2064
03:08:12,680 --> 03:08:14,040
It does have like a dolphin sound.

2065
03:08:14,040 --> 03:08:14,920
You were good.

2066
03:08:14,920 --> 03:08:15,319
Come back.

2067
03:08:16,120 --> 03:08:20,270
Vinny, that's called a dolphin.

2068
03:08:20,270 --> 03:08:20,510
Yeah.

2069
03:08:20,510 --> 03:08:24,559
No, I just wanted to be even more specific with my reference.

2070
03:08:24,559 --> 03:08:25,040
That's all.

2071
03:08:25,040 --> 03:08:25,600
What's it doing?

2072
03:08:29,680 --> 03:08:32,479
Oh, what the fuck?

2073
03:08:32,479 --> 03:08:35,450
I okay.

2074
03:08:35,450 --> 03:08:36,809
That was pretty ridiculous.

2075
03:08:40,920 --> 03:08:42,120
Oh, do it.

2076
03:08:42,120 --> 03:08:42,520
Damn it.

2077
03:08:42,520 --> 03:08:43,000
Not in the head.

2078
03:08:43,639 --> 03:08:46,440
Come on.

2079
03:08:47,159 --> 03:08:50,379
Oh, didn't hit pounders can do.

2080
03:08:50,379 --> 03:08:50,620
All right.

2081
03:08:50,620 --> 03:08:53,020
So three springs makes a pounder.

2082
03:08:53,819 --> 03:08:59,040
Watch this.

2083
03:08:59,040 --> 03:09:00,159
Oh, man.

2084
03:09:02,079 --> 03:09:02,319
Yeah.

2085
03:09:02,319 --> 03:09:05,200
Three springs on top of each other makes like a big hammer that swings down.

2086
03:09:06,000 --> 03:09:12,670
Ready to go.

2087
03:09:25,370 --> 03:09:26,090
That's amazing.

2088
03:09:26,889 --> 03:09:34,170
Oh, shit.

2089
03:09:36,200 --> 03:09:39,639
Yeah, I'm like a little too slow for this enemy right now.

2090
03:09:39,639 --> 03:09:40,760
Then again, you have a hammer.

2091
03:09:40,760 --> 03:09:45,079
So honestly, you using the springs gets a knockdown if you get it right in the head.

2092
03:10:05,149 --> 03:10:05,389
Shit.

2093
03:10:08,479 --> 03:10:09,600
I'm trying to climb up there.

2094
03:10:13,450 --> 03:10:14,170
Stop camping.

2095
03:10:14,809 --> 03:10:30,489
Oh, I'm out of materials.

2096
03:10:31,129 --> 03:10:32,879
Is there any materials like any threads?

2097
03:10:34,159 --> 03:10:34,719
You know what?

2098
03:10:34,719 --> 03:10:40,639
I thought maybe the weak point, but this enemy might be too small to grab thread from.

2099
03:10:48,360 --> 03:10:49,000
Oh, shit.

2100
03:10:49,559 --> 03:10:53,950
Did I get it?

2101
03:10:53,950 --> 03:10:54,190
No.

2102
03:10:58,479 --> 03:10:59,760
So fucking fast.

2103
03:11:04,969 --> 03:11:05,209
Shit.

2104
03:11:05,209 --> 03:11:05,850
I don't have any more.

2105
03:11:07,600 --> 03:11:08,959
Whoa, did you get it?

2106
03:11:08,959 --> 03:11:09,920
Now's the time.

2107
03:11:09,920 --> 03:11:10,719
Yeah, now's the time.

2108
03:11:16,909 --> 03:11:17,149
Yes.

2109
03:11:17,790 --> 03:11:20,079
Oh, I got the big hit.

2110
03:11:22,360 --> 03:11:23,159
All right, he's running.

2111
03:11:27,450 --> 03:11:31,049
All right, let's try to get some thread, too, because that hammer move is so good.

2112
03:11:31,850 --> 03:11:34,459
You can collect it from a lot of places.

2113
03:11:35,760 --> 03:11:38,399
Someone said they keep hearing the Splatoon disconnect sound.

2114
03:11:39,200 --> 03:11:40,000
It's the same thing.

2115
03:11:40,000 --> 03:11:42,879
It's just like a water drop with a reverb.

2116
03:11:43,840 --> 03:11:52,379
The threads.

2117
03:11:53,020 --> 03:11:56,010
Threads over here.

2118
03:11:56,729 --> 03:12:02,010
I found some, too.

2119
03:12:02,569 --> 03:12:06,649
If you hold down left trigger, you can see what gives you.

2120
03:12:06,649 --> 03:12:08,889
Yeah, it's like it's like spider vision.

2121
03:12:21,020 --> 03:12:25,069
You're going to want to see this on my way.

2122
03:12:25,069 --> 03:12:26,270
Yeah, it was very odd.

2123
03:12:27,069 --> 03:12:37,959
Oh, is this the same thing we were attacking before?

2124
03:12:38,920 --> 03:12:39,399
Smash it.

2125
03:12:40,120 --> 03:12:40,600
Oh, it is.

2126
03:12:40,600 --> 03:12:41,159
Yeah, it's mad.

2127
03:12:50,139 --> 03:12:51,739
Oh, don't die here.

2128
03:12:52,540 --> 03:12:55,360
What did you just make?

2129
03:12:56,649 --> 03:12:57,530
Pounder.

2130
03:12:57,530 --> 03:12:58,569
Oh, that was a pounder.

2131
03:12:59,629 --> 03:13:07,870
Yep.

2132
03:13:07,870 --> 03:13:09,309
Oh, opportunity.

2133
03:13:11,360 --> 03:13:12,159
Nice.

2134
03:13:12,159 --> 03:13:14,799
Just did like 396 damage or 68 rather.

2135
03:13:15,680 --> 03:13:17,799
Stay right here.

2136
03:13:18,840 --> 03:13:19,639
I got 250.

2137
03:13:26,829 --> 03:13:28,590
Oh, that would have been fucking awesome.

2138
03:13:29,309 --> 03:13:30,110
Whatever.

2139
03:13:30,110 --> 03:13:45,040
A lot of materials over here.

2140
03:13:45,600 --> 03:13:48,319
Jerma, if you walk into the torch, your weapon will.

2141
03:13:48,319 --> 03:13:50,639
Oh, oh, he put it out.

2142
03:13:51,280 --> 03:13:56,000
I don't know the big sack bounce.

2143
03:13:56,799 --> 03:13:58,719
Oh, that hurts a lot.

2144
03:13:58,719 --> 03:13:59,360
I am dead.

2145
03:14:04,959 --> 03:14:05,520
Thank God.

2146
03:14:05,520 --> 03:14:06,159
He ran away.

2147
03:14:06,879 --> 03:14:10,459
All right.

2148
03:14:10,459 --> 03:14:11,899
Healing, healing, healing.

2149
03:14:11,899 --> 03:14:12,299
Thank you.

2150
03:14:13,180 --> 03:14:16,059
Dammit.

2151
03:14:19,000 --> 03:14:19,319
Smash.

2152
03:14:21,639 --> 03:14:23,559
Oh, missed.

2153
03:14:29,280 --> 03:14:29,600
Nice.

2154
03:14:30,239 --> 03:14:32,540
No stun, though.

2155
03:14:33,420 --> 03:14:34,219
Oh, I got sacked.

2156
03:14:35,180 --> 03:14:35,899
Not too bad.

2157
03:14:35,899 --> 03:14:37,100
Oh, you got worse than I did.

2158
03:14:37,100 --> 03:14:37,739
Yeah, that hurt.

2159
03:14:38,540 --> 03:14:42,489
All right.

2160
03:14:42,489 --> 03:14:45,129
Seems to be out of that weird like intense mode.

2161
03:15:01,040 --> 03:15:02,959
Do you have any materials for this?

2162
03:15:02,959 --> 03:15:03,920
I got no materials.

2163
03:15:04,639 --> 03:15:05,040
All out.

2164
03:15:05,840 --> 03:15:06,879
I think we're pretty close, though.

2165
03:15:07,600 --> 03:15:09,440
Yeah, it should shouldn't be too much longer.

2166
03:15:09,440 --> 03:15:10,559
What the hell?

2167
03:15:10,559 --> 03:15:11,120
That was weird.

2168
03:15:19,229 --> 03:15:22,040
Running materials.

2169
03:15:23,469 --> 03:15:24,829
Yeah, there's a crystal over here.

2170
03:15:24,829 --> 03:15:25,329
Yep.

2171
03:15:25,790 --> 03:15:27,629
This is also one of those dragon things.

2172
03:15:28,350 --> 03:15:31,290
All right.

2173
03:15:31,290 --> 03:15:33,450
Is that a wooden horse?

2174
03:15:34,329 --> 03:15:38,200
All right.

2175
03:15:38,200 --> 03:15:39,159
I got full threads.

2176
03:15:43,440 --> 03:15:44,959
Finding a lot of these balls.

2177
03:15:44,959 --> 03:15:46,000
Oh, here comes trouble.

2178
03:15:52,569 --> 03:15:53,770
Yeah, this is a wooden horse.

2179
03:15:54,409 --> 03:15:55,659
Can we break it?

2180
03:15:56,700 --> 03:15:58,409
I don't think so.

2181
03:16:00,959 --> 03:16:03,200
Where did where'd our friend go?

2182
03:16:03,200 --> 03:16:04,239
Oh, down that way.

2183
03:16:04,239 --> 03:16:05,040
Very far away.

2184
03:16:06,000 --> 03:16:11,610
Oh, we're saying funny comedic line.

2185
03:16:11,610 --> 03:16:12,729
Oh, I see what you're doing.

2186
03:16:13,610 --> 03:16:18,520
Jerma, we're gonna we're gonna do this.

2187
03:16:18,520 --> 03:16:19,020
Ready?

2188
03:16:19,559 --> 03:16:22,489
You're talking about dropping down from

2189
03:16:23,879 --> 03:16:25,959
I'm dropping down from the zip line.

2190
03:16:25,959 --> 03:16:26,840
I think I fucked up.

2191
03:16:26,840 --> 03:16:27,159
Hang on.

2192
03:16:27,159 --> 03:16:27,559
Hang on.

2193
03:16:27,559 --> 03:16:28,200
Let me try again.

2194
03:16:28,200 --> 03:16:29,239
We could do that.

2195
03:16:29,239 --> 03:16:30,600
We could we could zip up here.

2196
03:16:30,600 --> 03:16:32,040
Maybe now we get this.

2197
03:16:33,399 --> 03:16:34,350
All right.

2198
03:16:34,350 --> 03:16:36,989
If we get this, there needs to be only pogs in the chat.

2199
03:16:40,639 --> 03:16:41,440
Okay.

2200
03:16:41,440 --> 03:16:44,159
So you take one up here and then jump off from here.

2201
03:16:44,959 --> 03:16:47,280
Maybe I'm not sure I did a good job with this.

2202
03:16:49,159 --> 03:16:51,239
No, we're getting close, dude.

2203
03:16:51,239 --> 03:16:51,959
Never mind.

2204
03:16:51,959 --> 03:16:53,319
It was still cool.

2205
03:16:53,319 --> 03:16:54,680
It's not even the same monster.

2206
03:16:55,399 --> 03:16:55,879
It's not?

2207
03:16:56,680 --> 03:16:56,920
No.

2208
03:16:57,479 --> 03:16:58,040
What?

2209
03:16:58,040 --> 03:17:00,200
Oh, this is yeah, this is like a peacock.

2210
03:17:01,000 --> 03:17:01,959
What the fuck is this?

2211
03:17:07,280 --> 03:17:08,799
Where did the monster go?

2212
03:17:10,399 --> 03:17:10,959
Down here?

2213
03:17:20,319 --> 03:17:21,120
Uh, come over here.

2214
03:17:21,680 --> 03:17:24,879
Did you find it?

2215
03:17:24,879 --> 03:17:26,000
I think it's down here.

2216
03:17:27,120 --> 03:17:28,719
Let's activate this.

2217
03:17:28,719 --> 03:17:28,959
All right.

2218
03:17:30,510 --> 03:17:30,829
Ready?

2219
03:17:31,469 --> 03:17:33,959
That's it.

2220
03:17:33,959 --> 03:17:34,200
Right?

2221
03:17:34,200 --> 03:17:34,440
Yep.

2222
03:17:34,440 --> 03:17:34,920
Right here.

2223
03:17:34,920 --> 03:17:35,239
All right.

2224
03:17:35,239 --> 03:17:35,959
Pogs in the chat.

2225
03:17:40,319 --> 03:17:40,559
No!

2226
03:17:41,280 --> 03:17:41,600
What?

2227
03:17:41,600 --> 03:17:42,159
Did you get it?

2228
03:17:45,149 --> 03:17:46,110
So I certainly didn't.

2229
03:17:46,110 --> 03:17:48,110
I just felt flat on my fucking face.

2230
03:17:49,870 --> 03:17:50,989
We died.

2231
03:17:50,989 --> 03:17:51,790
Yeah, we died.

2232
03:17:52,590 --> 03:17:53,149
It's all right.

2233
03:17:53,149 --> 03:17:55,149
That was really oh my god.

2234
03:17:55,149 --> 03:17:57,469
I thought that was going to do like 10,000 damage.

2235
03:17:57,469 --> 03:17:58,190
No, we didn't die.

2236
03:17:58,190 --> 03:17:58,750
We didn't die.

2237
03:17:58,750 --> 03:17:59,149
We didn't die.

2238
03:17:59,149 --> 03:17:59,629
No, we're good.

2239
03:17:59,629 --> 03:17:59,870
We're good.

2240
03:17:59,870 --> 03:18:00,270
We're good.

2241
03:18:00,909 --> 03:18:01,229
All right.

2242
03:18:01,870 --> 03:18:02,430
Oh my god.

2243
03:18:02,430 --> 03:18:04,030
I thought that was going to do like a hundred K.

2244
03:18:06,270 --> 03:18:06,909
That's sad.

2245
03:18:11,799 --> 03:18:12,280
All right.

2246
03:18:12,280 --> 03:18:12,920
I'm engaging.

2247
03:18:21,440 --> 03:18:21,920
Big hit.

2248
03:18:26,809 --> 03:18:38,219
Damn it.

2249
03:18:38,219 --> 03:18:38,540
Nice.

2250
03:18:38,540 --> 03:18:39,100
That was perfect.

2251
03:18:40,639 --> 03:18:41,280
No stun though.

2252
03:18:41,920 --> 03:18:45,709
I just got.

2253
03:18:45,709 --> 03:18:45,950
Wow.

2254
03:18:45,950 --> 03:18:46,989
He knocked me into the water.

2255
03:18:52,299 --> 03:18:52,700
Damn it.

2256
03:18:59,870 --> 03:19:01,790
That was an unbelievable amount of damage.

2257
03:19:02,510 --> 03:19:04,139
Oh, it's okay.

2258
03:19:04,139 --> 03:19:04,540
This is it.

2259
03:19:05,340 --> 03:19:11,129
I just always horn knocked off.

2260
03:19:11,930 --> 03:19:17,360
I think we did it.

2261
03:19:18,000 --> 03:19:18,239
Nice.

2262
03:19:19,040 --> 03:19:20,620
You can do the final.

2263
03:19:21,260 --> 03:19:22,620
No, you can do the honors.

2264
03:19:22,620 --> 03:19:23,100
Okay.

2265
03:19:23,100 --> 03:19:25,500
I want to see a hammer lodged into its cranium anyway.

2266
03:19:29,069 --> 03:19:29,950
Crash.

2267
03:19:29,950 --> 03:19:30,969
Wait, what happened?

2268
03:19:31,770 --> 03:19:32,489
Oh, okay.

2269
03:19:32,489 --> 03:19:32,809
I see.

2270
03:19:38,360 --> 03:19:39,799
I think the horn came off.

2271
03:19:39,799 --> 03:19:40,440
That's crazy.

2272
03:19:42,270 --> 03:19:42,590
Cool.

2273
03:19:43,600 --> 03:19:44,079
Glider.

2274
03:19:44,639 --> 03:19:48,799
Make sure you get the horn.

2275
03:19:52,969 --> 03:19:56,010
It's also like, yeah, we don't even have to initiate a hunt.

2276
03:19:56,010 --> 03:19:58,489
We just like are just hunting.

2277
03:19:58,489 --> 03:19:59,610
You can just kind of go wherever you want.

2278
03:20:00,329 --> 03:20:00,569
Yeah.

2279
03:20:02,510 --> 03:20:04,030
Now you can conjure gliders.

2280
03:20:08,680 --> 03:20:08,920
Yeah.

2281
03:20:08,920 --> 03:20:12,159
The tools, I think.

2282
03:20:13,200 --> 03:20:14,479
Dude, I'm in a helicopter.

2283
03:20:15,040 --> 03:20:17,120
All right.

2284
03:20:17,120 --> 03:20:17,680
That's pretty cool.

2285
03:20:19,020 --> 03:20:23,180
You probably figure out what you want to use for a loadout for this stuff.

2286
03:20:24,399 --> 03:20:24,959
I imagine.

2287
03:20:24,959 --> 03:20:28,079
Yeah, you probably choose when you unlock a bunch of them.

2288
03:20:28,079 --> 03:20:31,840
Because at some point, you're going to have a couple dozen of these, right?

2289
03:20:31,840 --> 03:20:35,500
So, I mean, you kind of have to choose what you want.

2290
03:20:35,500 --> 03:20:36,379
Wind vortex.

2291
03:20:40,559 --> 03:20:43,469
How did you get the glider?

2292
03:20:43,469 --> 03:20:44,909
What happens when you stack gliders?

2293
03:20:45,629 --> 03:20:47,149
I think you have it now too, no?

2294
03:20:47,149 --> 03:20:48,190
Do I?

2295
03:20:48,190 --> 03:20:51,549
Is it in that Karakuri menu or no?

2296
03:20:51,549 --> 03:20:55,209
Yeah, it's a A button.

2297
03:20:55,209 --> 03:20:56,329
Oh, so we just have it now?

2298
03:20:57,049 --> 03:20:57,290
Yeah.

2299
03:20:57,930 --> 03:20:59,049
Or you could just take one of mine.

2300
03:20:59,610 --> 03:21:10,889
What are the physics of this?

2301
03:21:10,889 --> 03:21:11,770
How does this even work?

2302
03:21:12,329 --> 03:21:13,370
I think it just kind of floats around.

2303
03:21:17,389 --> 03:21:18,110
Well, that was fun.

2304
03:21:20,270 --> 03:21:21,069
Are you good?

2305
03:21:22,110 --> 03:21:22,750
I'm done.

2306
03:21:22,750 --> 03:21:23,629
I'm going to go to sleep.

2307
03:21:23,629 --> 03:21:24,829
I'm tired.

2308
03:21:24,829 --> 03:21:28,590
But I actually enjoyed this more than I expected to.

2309
03:21:30,430 --> 03:21:31,309
Not to say it like that.

2310
03:21:31,309 --> 03:21:35,309
But once you start fighting and getting the mechanics, it is fun.

2311
03:21:35,309 --> 03:21:36,909
Mechanically, the game is sound.

2312
03:21:36,909 --> 03:21:38,110
And I like the monsters.

2313
03:21:38,989 --> 03:21:41,629
So I'm ready to go to sleep now.

2314
03:21:41,629 --> 03:21:44,350
Like other games like this, like in Monster Hunter or whatever,

2315
03:21:45,149 --> 03:21:50,409
you really do need to play for like an hour or two before it's like, oh, I get it.

2316
03:21:50,409 --> 03:21:55,739
OK, because after the first couple of hours, we just kind of learn what

2317
03:21:55,739 --> 03:21:59,899
is when you first get shown this new mechanic, it's kind of like, what the fuck is this?

2318
03:21:59,899 --> 03:22:00,459
What is this?

2319
03:22:01,659 --> 03:22:02,540
And then it's like, oh, wait.

2320
03:22:02,540 --> 03:22:06,780
Oh, oh, yeah, no, it's pretty much.

2321
03:22:07,579 --> 03:22:08,139
Yeah, it was good.

2322
03:22:08,139 --> 03:22:10,540
And it was just good playing playing game with your germ.

2323
03:22:10,540 --> 03:22:11,659
No, I enjoyed this.

2324
03:22:12,940 --> 03:22:14,780
Thanks for I mean, I reached out.

2325
03:22:15,020 --> 03:22:16,620
It was like, hey, you want to do this?

2326
03:22:16,620 --> 03:22:19,709
So Vinny was was cool enough to jump in.

2327
03:22:19,709 --> 03:22:23,239
So yeah, well, thanks for the invite.

2328
03:22:24,120 --> 03:22:26,010
I'm going to quit out.

2329
03:22:26,010 --> 03:22:27,450
And yeah, thanks, everybody.

2330
03:22:27,450 --> 03:22:31,209
And German chat, thank you for like bringing your unhinged chat messages

2331
03:22:31,209 --> 03:22:32,489
to my chat for a little bit.

2332
03:22:32,489 --> 03:22:33,760
That was fun.

2333
03:22:33,760 --> 03:22:37,399
And yeah, I'm sure we'll play more stuff in the future.

2334
03:22:37,399 --> 03:22:38,120
But thanks, man.

2335
03:22:38,120 --> 03:22:39,079
Have a good night.

2336
03:22:39,079 --> 03:22:39,879
Yeah, you too.

2337
03:22:39,879 --> 03:22:41,479
Thanks for coming up.

2338
03:22:41,479 --> 03:22:41,979
See you.

2339
03:22:44,059 --> 03:22:45,180
That was Vinny.

2340
03:22:45,180 --> 03:22:47,079
Fine sauce.

2341
03:22:47,079 --> 03:22:47,879
Awesome, dude.

2342
03:22:47,879 --> 03:22:54,920
Because I figured playing a game like this multiplayer is kind of more interesting anyways,

2343
03:22:54,920 --> 03:22:56,719
for me at least.

2344
03:22:56,719 --> 03:23:03,399
And that is going to conclude the sponsor part of the stream.

2345
03:23:03,399 --> 03:23:05,959
Like Vinny said, I'm pleasantly surprised.

2346
03:23:05,959 --> 03:23:10,860
Took a little bit to kind of get the feel of things, but it's really fun.

2347
03:23:10,860 --> 03:23:13,659
I have to imagine that there'll probably be some patches for it.

2348
03:23:14,829 --> 03:23:16,030
It's on everything again.

2349
03:23:16,030 --> 03:23:18,030
EA, thank you for sponsoring this part of the stream.

2350
03:23:18,030 --> 03:23:19,790
That was really, really cool.

2351
03:23:19,790 --> 03:23:23,659
I very much enjoyed that time.

2352
03:23:23,659 --> 03:23:26,860
Multiplayer was smooth in a game like this.

2353
03:23:26,860 --> 03:23:29,659
Like I said, that's probably the number one feature that,

2354
03:23:29,659 --> 03:23:33,659
I know I keep harping on it, but I keep talking about it.

2355
03:23:35,959 --> 03:23:42,139
That's really nice to not just be able to jump in and just play.

2356
03:23:42,139 --> 03:23:43,819
But yeah, thank you, EA.

2357
03:23:43,819 --> 03:23:45,180
That concludes this part of the stream.

2358
03:23:45,180 --> 03:23:46,219
We're going to move on.

2359
03:23:46,219 --> 03:23:49,280
I'm going to go back to last hero of nostalgia.

2360
03:23:49,280 --> 03:23:59,629
That was Wild Hearts, available now on pretty much every platform,

2361
03:23:59,629 --> 03:24:00,750
every current platform.

2362
03:24:00,750 --> 03:24:02,030
So I'm going to take a break.

2363
03:24:02,030 --> 03:24:02,590
I'll be right back.

2364
03:24:02,590 --> 03:24:08,620
I'm going to pee, maybe get some more water,

2365
03:24:08,620 --> 03:24:11,260
and we will play some more.

2366
03:24:11,260 --> 03:24:12,139
Be right back.
