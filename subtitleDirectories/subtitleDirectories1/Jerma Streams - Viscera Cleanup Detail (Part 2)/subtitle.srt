1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:08,519
I was muted for a long time. Usually I don't take that long. I know that a lot of streamers on this platform

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:20,250
Sometimes don't a lot of people do like a 25 minute countdown or something. I couldn't do that. I just sit here and

3
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:24,949
Two three minutes go by and i'm just like I i'm supposed to say something, right?

4
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,629
I could never do like a 20 minute countdown to start the streams

5
00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:36,390
It would get to 17 minutes and I would just scream and press the unmute button and be like i'm guys i'm here

6
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:43,850
I haven't been i've just been here for 15 straight minutes. He sounds different

7
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:55,619
I got I got a little bit of a nose bug. It'll clear up wasp

8
00:00:58,539 --> 00:01:00,780
Here comes the end of the stream. No, what?

9
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:05,019
That's not what's happening

10
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:11,900
i'm ready to play

11
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:15,260
end of the stream voice and so okay, first of all, I

12
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:19,109
Somebody just clipped to that

13
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:20,230
what

14
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,799
Why?

15
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:29,079
What did I do there?

16
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:31,079
Somebody just clipped whatever I just said

17
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,239
It was me

18
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:43,099
Why he doesn't know it's kind of funny because I see in real time when somebody takes a clip

19
00:01:43,099 --> 00:01:45,099
It's a little thing on my dashboard

20
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:49,739
And i'm always sometimes I get self-conscious because i'll be like blah blah blah. Yeah. Yeah, yada. Yada

21
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:52,219
Can I look over a new clip and i'm just like what happened?

22
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,340
What did I do?

23
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,340
Should I not have said that what?

24
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:03,060
Who are you sharing that with?

25
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,299
Nah, how you guys doing? Hope you had a good relaxing

26
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:10,580
A couple of days. Hope you had uh had some fun. Hope you did some things. Hope you were productive

27
00:02:10,659 --> 00:02:12,819
Probably you were productive as well, you know

28
00:02:13,539 --> 00:02:19,270
Today we're gonna play vista or cleanup detail because you know, I just feel like cleaning shit up

29
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:25,699
I'm in the mood for kenshi

30
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,300
Yeah, kenshi is a lot of fun

31
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,099
But i've been away from vista. I played it once

32
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:32,979
And I had a shitload of fun. So I want to do it again

33
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,740
I just like cleaning things up sometimes

34
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,509
It's my guilty video game pleasure

35
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,490
house flipper

36
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:53,689
Vista or cleanup detail. It's easy just to mop stuff up on the ground and talk about chrono trigger

37
00:02:55,159 --> 00:03:00,840
You know what I mean?

38
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,840
Anyways, uh, i'll be right back

39
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,719
Give me two seconds. I just want to make sure the game opens and doesn't crash

40
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:17,240
We're right back. It's not a guilty pleasure if you share it with 5 000 people. What?

41
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:21,030
That could be a guilty pleasure still

42
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,340
Okay, how is that not still a guilty pleasure? All right, you know, whatever we're right back

43
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:44,120
Like if I robbed a bank on stream, that would be guilty. That'd be a guilty pleasure, right?

44
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:46,199
Like i'm gonna i'm gonna go i'm going to jail

45
00:03:46,759 --> 00:04:08,569
All right, we're good

46
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:12,330
No, that's not what i'm talking about. You guys know i'm talking about like in grand theft auto 5 when you do a heist with

47
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,009
Your friends

48
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:18,920
I would go to the in-game video game jail context. You gotta have the context

49
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,660
Otherwise, wait, what the hell does that mean?

50
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:29,899
Gotta do revengeance dlc. Yeah, there's a lot of things to do

51
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:36,699
I like cleaning by myself. I don't like I don't like other people cleaning with me

52
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:42,459
I don't want somebody to clean my room with me because what if they find like the dirty underwear and

53
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:46,699
crushed up fucking

54
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:52,709
Hot pocket wrappers. No, that's my it's a guilty pleasure of mine hot pockets, you know

55
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:56,629
They're disgusting. I haven't eaten one in probably four years. Don't take that as an endorsement

56
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:02,540
Uh, save file. I don't have any on this one. This is okay. We're gonna do

57
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,540
Clean up

58
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,370
So now we get to pick

59
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:20,220
Which one of these should I do today one hour one hour two hours 30 minutes evil science looks kind of cool

60
00:05:22,709 --> 00:05:31,420
zero g therapy

61
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,480
incubation emergency

62
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:40,300
up rinsing

63
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:45,579
Do a straw poll this so there are too many things to choose from I can't do a straw poll

64
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:47,740
But this will take like 30 minutes to write all these

65
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:53,540
I think uh evil science seems like kind of fun

66
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:57,769
either that or

67
00:05:57,769 --> 00:06:05,860
What is this one penumbra ice moon research outpost?

68
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:17,660
Smart click smart click ain't gonna work here. Don't let dumb chat choose for you

69
00:06:18,939 --> 00:06:22,939
Like these only take like two hours. Okay. I'm gonna get through look. I know how to play now

70
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:25,100
I'm gonna do evil science

71
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,069
The two hours and 30 minutes add like two hours of germa time

72
00:06:28,069 --> 00:06:32,360
So it's gonna be like four hours and 30 minutes and then I could do another one

73
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:37,029
That's like an hour, which is like add like add plus one hour of uh of time

74
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,540
Yeah, I can do two

75
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:45,620
Evil science. Let's see if I can get this done in like three hours. I think I can

76
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:52,870
Worksite game rules, uh foot. No, we're gonna keep it here

77
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:59,300
Time limit. What is that 300 minutes?

78
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,800
No, no time limit that'll that'll get that'll fuck me up

79
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:12,149
I'll get to the end and it'll really that'll get under my skin so much

80
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:17,779
Disable the sniffer. No, keep a sniff. I want that footprints. That's fine. I can't make mistakes

81
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:24,019
I'm ready

82
00:07:24,019 --> 00:07:31,269
Start work. Why are we still not playing big? What?

83
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:43,319
What what is that? What word did you just say? Okay, we're gonna start work

84
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:50,490
I'm gonna do it till my hands burn. I'm gonna do this until my hands burn

85
00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:55,529
Oh, okay

86
00:07:55,529 --> 00:08:01,529
Name janitor age 25 junior executive janitor given the nature of the janitor work that was carried out within the last facility

87
00:08:02,009 --> 00:08:06,250
Your absolute discretion is paramount. Didn't I have a computer and shit on the other safe file?

88
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:14,420
Federation representatives will be arriving in a week that it is imperative that the facility be cleaned and organized before said time

89
00:08:15,449 --> 00:08:19,629
Failure to perform your duties within company protocol on time will result in immediate termination

90
00:08:21,129 --> 00:08:26,970
You are most assuredly an expendable piece within an organization that is in your best interest to conduct yourself

91
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:31,769
Admirably be absolutely certain that the facility is spotless

92
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:41,320
Guaranteed hygienic and in working order. All right, welcome back to viscera cleanup detail. My name is german on a5

00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,580
Uh, where do I go? Let's take a look first

95
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:53,820

00:08:54,059 --> 00:09:00,120
Hold on. Let's take a look at the big hallway. I'm gonna get lost in here doesn't look too bad

97
00:09:01,419 --> 00:09:03,419
big hallway leading down to

98
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,549

99
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:15,190
Uh, I can always tell when i'm really mouth open have no idea. I just didn't think the butt head

100
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:20,090
Uh-huh. So these are all locked

101
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:27,419
Am I gonna have to get all right? I just need to look first

102
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,590
Shave us. Okay

103
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:33,990
Maybe you should buy yourself a narco

104
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:45,240
Let's get the music on here. What? Oh, how do I how do you pick items up again?

105
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:52,309
e

106
00:09:52,309 --> 00:09:56,549
Well, right need the hands right and then there's a way to whoops

107
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:00,840
Is it shift?

108
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,799
z

109
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:02,840
alt

110
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,200
right click

111
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:10,889
Hold left click. There it is. Look at that

112
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:14,919
Okay, what's on the music file here?

113
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:22,340
Oh, that's right. I turned it all off because we were listening to chrono trigger

114
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:32,539
What's the music on this one? Uh, I listened to that for like three hours

115
00:10:41,129 --> 00:10:43,129
Okay

116
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:46,009
That's all right. That's what those are both the same song

117
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:54,730
That's too intense for me. I didn't I need something less intense

118
00:11:00,169 --> 00:11:01,769
now that's

119
00:11:01,769 --> 00:11:08,169
Too quirky for me. I don't like the generic cassio keyboard drum beat

120
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:13,769
No, all right. Sounds all right

121
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:20,820
No, no skunks in the machine

122
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,009
No

123
00:11:24,009 --> 00:11:25,049
No

124
00:11:25,049 --> 00:11:26,009
No

125
00:11:26,009 --> 00:11:26,970
No

126
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:29,129
No, no, no, no

127
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,700
I think I want this one

128
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:37,320
All right. Let's take a look. We got a lot of ground to cover

129
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:44,009
There's a lot of ground to cover

130
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:46,100
uh

131
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,100
Upper level is this an elevator?

132
00:11:50,570 --> 00:12:04,740
No, it's not how big is this? Oh my god. This is gonna take me like 12 hours. Look at this mess

133
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,480
And there's multiple locked doors

134
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:20,179
Oh

135
00:12:20,179 --> 00:12:22,259
Okay, I need to still we got i'm gonna start up top

136
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,200
Yeah, i'm gonna start up top

137
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,649
Because i'm gonna work my way down

138
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:34,730
What do we get water in this one? The other one was like had elves in it and there was a funny elf machine

139
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:39,350
Do I can I do I have to bring buckets upstairs for this shit?

140
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:51,620
All right. I'm ready. No, i'm not ready. I'm so overwhelmed right now go out outside and down

141
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:02,360
Okay, here is the trash machine. Let's just start in front of the elevator

142
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,820
I don't know what to do. This is what happened in real life

143
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:09,850
If you walked into a scene like this

144
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,179
And you were told all right, you got to clean that up. You'd be like, okay

145
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:16,779
You don't know where the fuck to start

146
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:23,190
Okay, let's go

147
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:36,539
I'm gonna start right in front. I need to throw i'm so overwhelmed. I really am this is like hey Jeremy

148
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,620
This is why you play it with like five people

149
00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:42,009
Not me. I need to clean alone

150
00:13:46,419 --> 00:13:49,529
All right, we made some progress

151
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:56,580
Look at we already made progress. I didn't have to do anything. No, I have friends

152
00:13:57,139 --> 00:13:58,419
But I don't

153
00:13:58,419 --> 00:14:02,330
I I like to clean alone

154
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:04,889
And plus like somebody would say like a funny joke and I would miss it

155
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,750
I'd be too busy going like this

156
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:22,009
Oops, I have friends of it. I don't well, come on man. I just moved to vegas

157
00:14:22,649 --> 00:14:27,379
I don't know anybody out here

158
00:14:27,379 --> 00:14:29,779
How am I supposed to connect with my friends? I moved to vegas

159
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,940
We bought the internet. Oh, that's right. This isn't that we're on the internet

160
00:14:37,659 --> 00:14:39,659
I can just call them on the internet phone

161
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,899
I love this game. It really is so much fun just to do nothing

162
00:14:46,539 --> 00:14:51,909
Does anybody else feel that way too?

163
00:14:51,909 --> 00:14:53,990
Is it weird that remember we were talking about

164
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:57,350
Stuff. Hey, Jeremy, what would you do if you weren't like screaming?

165
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,399
this

166
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:08,860
I would probably want to do this dude. I would do you know what i'm talking about. I would just sit here

167
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,100
I would just put on the joe rogan podcast man and just like zone the fuck out

168
00:15:27,049 --> 00:15:38,409
I like this idea though, because then i'm gonna make sure there's nothing on the ceiling. Nothing anywhere. You kidding me, man

169
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:42,730
Oh, I would just open up children's surprise egg videos

170
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:46,889
On repeat while I just did this it'd be amazing

171
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:58,759
Because I don't know man. Like what's what's in that egg?

172
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:02,539
Open it

173
00:16:02,539 --> 00:16:08,169
Oh, it's a mini spider-man. Whoa. Awesome. I don't know. It was in that egg. It could have been anything

174
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:12,100
What's in the next one?

175
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,100
A hatchimal. Oh, yeah

176
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:31,000
I've seen those before. Hey, what do we got binoculars?

177
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:40,019
Can I look in them? No, I can't even can't. I love fuck you a lemon lime binoculars

178
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,340
What's this biohazard material?

179
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:55,480
Hey, you know, I had one of these

180
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,799
No, no, no, not a bed pan. Not a bed pan. I had

181
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,360
I had one of these

182
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:04,890
I did I owned one of these

183
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:08,089
Who'd somebody just gave a shitload of subs?

184
00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:12,700
Uh, jinxibo just gave five community subs. Thank you

185
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:17,740
Thank you so much jinxibo

186
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:21,000
All right. Now come on. I need to bound

187
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,660
Where's the where's the fire for this thing?

188
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:30,569
In the christmas month, there was a big giant fire. Where's the giant fire?

189
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:33,609
Is this a fire?

190
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:39,289
If you are attacked or severely injured, please report to the nearest medical facility treatment. What do you mean attacked?

191
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,099
What the hell is this?

192
00:17:43,099 --> 00:17:45,099
toilet seat pizza slicer

193
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,980
What?

194
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,980
Why are they giving out toilet seats?

195
00:17:54,059 --> 00:18:04,180
toilet seats

196
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,700
I got a feeling

197
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,700
That i'm gonna have to replace toilet seats

198
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,619
Okay, that's fine. And I might no i'm not tracking. All right, we got this place almost clear

199
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:16,470
I need to I need to find the big fire in the middle. I need to find where the santa comes down

200
00:18:17,609 --> 00:18:21,190
That looks like where santa comes down. Oh, yeah it is

201
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,480
Mm-hmm

202
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,519
Uh-huh

203
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:36,250
Mm-hmm. This guy's not still alive is he?

204
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:43,660
I don't know if I'd want to fuck with that guy that guy had on one of the backpack super soakers

205
00:18:44,299 --> 00:18:48,200
Remember you were when you were a kid

206
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,200
You got in the super soaker fight

207
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:52,519
You got your

208
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:57,400
And it stopped and the little the little p came forward

209
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,000
That motherfucker rolls up with the backpack on

210
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:12,230
You're all in trouble. Oh that just scared the shit out of me

211
00:19:19,269 --> 00:19:22,390
All right, hold on I gotta I gotta put the I gotta put the giant maggots in here

212
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:30,339
Are these gonna fit?

213
00:19:30,339 --> 00:19:34,380
That fits right? Yeah

214
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:39,349
I'll come back later

215
00:19:39,349 --> 00:19:41,029
I hate this music

216
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:44,039
All right, we got some cells here

217
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:48,069
I don't want to listen to this but i'm going to

218
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:53,339
Holy shit

219
00:19:53,339 --> 00:19:58,180
Is this an alien?

220
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,180
All right. I don't like that. I don't like that

221
00:20:05,589 --> 00:20:07,990
I don't the eyes. I don't know what's going on with the eyes

222
00:20:08,309 --> 00:20:14,650
those eyes

223
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,650
You know what i'm saying when i'm talking about the eyes

224
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,220
They're like perfect cartoon eyes

225
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,980
All right. Well

226
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:30,460
I found the incinerator

227
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:40,730
I don't like that one. All right. So where was I? How much time has elapsed? 21 minutes. Oh boy

228
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,380
I'm never gonna get this done in two hours. Yes, I am

229
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:50,569
It's so big

230
00:20:50,569 --> 00:20:52,420
What is this?

231
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:57,140
A box? Okay, I can put some stuff in here and then put this in the fire

232
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:04,230
No, no, no, no get

233
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:07,160
All right. This is a whole nother. This is the exit

234
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:09,880
Yeah

235
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,119
I need to bring some uh barrels around here

236
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:18,329
I've got shell casings everywhere. This was an fps. That's for sure

237
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:24,519
One of the funnest coolest parts about this game is just figuring just seeing it out

238
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:29,720
What is this? Is this an fps or was this like an rts or an rpg? It's real like this is an fps

239
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:42,170
So cool. All right. Can you stop please? What why?

240
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:45,740
Why what?

241
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,740
Why is this still happening?

242
00:21:49,589 --> 00:22:01,819
Okay, we're fine now apparently I need a bucket. We gotta go middle out. I think there's no way

243
00:22:01,819 --> 00:22:03,819
I'm gonna walk across this whole time

244
00:22:03,819 --> 00:22:07,720
Can I pick up the?

245
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:10,339
Can I pick up the thing that generates?

246
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:18,390
No, no, just start just kidding. I'm getting distracted. Stop getting distracted. Give me one of these

247
00:22:19,269 --> 00:22:25,210
Give me like five of these

248
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,799
Does dynamite come out of this thing?

249
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:34,089
What's the joke for this one?

250
00:22:34,089 --> 00:22:40,220
What's what's like the the thing that pops out of here? I mean, so here's a joke right here

251
00:22:40,299 --> 00:22:42,299
But that's I mean, that's still kind of funny

252
00:22:49,529 --> 00:22:52,819
All right, let's put this one back here

253
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,779
I don't get much to do over there. I gotta incinerate that

254
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:01,190
I gotta get a mental mapping of where that incinerator is fucking is

255
00:23:03,779 --> 00:23:06,339
Okay mental map of where the incinerator is here we go ready

256
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:14,519
Straight and then you take a right. Nope. You don't straight then left. It's right there

257
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:17,079
I got a mental map now mentally decoded into my brain

258
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:27,750
I'm gonna leave it open. Why even just leave it open?

259
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:29,980
Okay

260
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,980
We got to go from back here

261
00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:34,230
I'm gonna do this now

262
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:44,710
All right, get in there

263
00:23:45,109 --> 00:23:47,109
Toasty that wasn't even funny

264
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,660
That wasn't even supposed to be funny. This was filling air

265
00:23:53,619 --> 00:23:55,619
I was just filling dead air

266
00:23:59,259 --> 00:24:06,490
Oh well, this has got to go too

267
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:18,500
Play the super mario brothers ost rpg. No, no, that was super mario brothers

268
00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:24,740
All right. I'm ready. I need another one of these buckets not tracking. No, i'm not

269
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:36,519
Beautiful beautiful come up this way. What are you doing to me? Oh, by the way, does the audio sound better today?

270
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,660
Am I a little louder today than I was a couple days ago?

271
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:44,500
I should be

272
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:50,250
I boosted myself a little I don't think this is gonna fit in here. Is it gonna fit in here?

273
00:24:51,609 --> 00:24:53,609
I think it's gonna exactly fit in here

274
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:08,390
It fits. All right. Good

275
00:25:09,109 --> 00:25:13,660
Now I just need a few more buckets. Oh, yeah

276
00:25:14,619 --> 00:25:17,240
A spill joke plus three

277
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,359
Yeah, go ahead keep track of all the times that I spill

278
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:24,630
Do it

279
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:27,029
Because then we're gonna do we're gonna go through and do some deductions

280
00:25:29,849 --> 00:25:32,009
No, why would I tell you to count in this chat?

281
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:34,650
That's something we don't want people doing

282
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:42,789
Every time that channel meme has a chance

283
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:45,430
To just go away

284
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:46,710
What do I do?

285
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:51,079
What's the first thing that I say after about two weeks of that meme people not doing it?

286
00:25:54,599 --> 00:26:01,690
Take give me like a counter. That's my own fault. This is gonna explode

287
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:20,119
No, I need some new buckets. I need none of these just put them in a pile over here

288
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:29,670
So I can keep dragging them. You literally know i'm was counting until you complained that everyone would count

289
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:32,390
Do you see the vicious cycle?

290
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,799
It's me. It's my own fault. I'm the outlier here

291
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,500
I'm the issue here

292
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,500
It's not you guys counting. It's me

293
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:48,299
I'm the problem

294
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:49,420
All right

295
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:52,460
No blood no bullshit over here. This is pretty clean

296
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:56,329
Just make sure the green is not alien goo, right?

297
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,980
See i'm the one that's counting

298
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:06,390
On you guys to be good in chat

299
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:24,119
I can do it. All right, get that out of here. We're almost done guys. We're getting close

300
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,759
We're almost done with the entry way

301
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,259
of the level

302
00:27:29,259 --> 00:27:30,940
Which is designed

303
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,299
For an 11 year old to do it

304
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:38,099
And no, I know 11 year old is playing this game. This is not like a game for kids

305
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,180
Why would I even make that comparison?

306
00:27:41,819 --> 00:27:46,660
No, like 10 year old is playing this that's not happening

307
00:27:54,009 --> 00:27:58,950
They are

308
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:02,099
No, they're not

309
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:07,880
There's only one game that a 10 year old is playing right now. Can you guess what it is?

310
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:18,009
ooh

311
00:28:18,009 --> 00:28:20,180
Wait, what fortnight?

312
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,900
Minecraft, what are you talking about?

313
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:27,420
You guys are way off

314
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:35,500
Oh, that's not a computer. What? Come on. It is a computer though. Is this a computer?

315
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,099
I need a computer

316
00:28:38,099 --> 00:28:41,849
Is this the computer?

317
00:28:41,849 --> 00:28:46,650
Where's the computer where this goes?

318
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:50,630
over here

319
00:28:50,630 --> 00:29:05,210
I don't know where these go. What's that?

320
00:29:05,529 --> 00:29:07,700
Is it upstairs?

321
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:18,230
It's probably in a different room

322
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,960
Got it

323
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,960
Nope, that's the elevator

324
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,180
Where's it gonna put it over here?

325
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:36,680
It's where I spawned though. I just can't believe nobody has said the games at all every 10 year old is playing right now

326
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:43,430
I'll give you a hint

327
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:56,900
It's on a phone

328
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,960
mafia city

329
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,960
What the hell is mafia city?

330
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:07,380
I've been asked again to reinforce the cell doors. I really don't see the point. They're strong enough

331
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:10,660
I mean we could possibly get through those. I've got more important jobs anyways

332
00:30:11,619 --> 00:30:19,450
Yeah, mafia city. Did I play that like four years ago?

333
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:21,930
I think I did

334
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:25,000
Isn't that one of those games I played?

335
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:43,099
It's some stupid game

336
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:45,259
Sponsored mobile stream

337
00:30:47,059 --> 00:30:49,779
All right. I will I will get I will guarantee you guys something

338
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:54,420
If there's ever a sponsored mobile game stream on this account

339
00:30:55,059 --> 00:30:56,660
It's not me

340
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:59,380
It's not me and and somehow they've impersonated me. I don't know how

341
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:08,170
I think if you if you see that on this stream, this is sponsored mobile game stream

342
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:11,769
And i'm like, hey guys, what's going on? Welcome to the stream. I'm in trouble somewhere

343
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:19,500
Like i've done

344
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:25,240
I don't know

345
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,950
Who would sponsor you?

346
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:30,950
Yeah, that's a good question. Hey, you know, that's a good question

347
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:37,210
PUBG mobile stream, but that was me on my own free will

348
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,440
That wasn't me sponsored to play that

349
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:42,250
Oh

350
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:45,720
I'm in trouble somewhere

351
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,720
It's up the ruiz is up

352
00:31:50,869 --> 00:31:53,430
That was the last stream I I ever did is me

353
00:31:54,150 --> 00:32:00,440
Wait, I played pubg willingly. I don't know. Not really

354
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,519
Yeah, I did what I played pubg on mobile for like 10 minutes

355
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:10,390
Because it was a joke

356
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:12,950
That doesn't count

357
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:17,190
Yeah, that doesn't count though. I played it on stream with you looking over my shoulder

358
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:19,349
It was almost best gaming moment of 2018

359
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:22,119
We all know that

360
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:25,000
I played an entire game and I won

361
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:31,319
Someone help him

362
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,940
Oh his dinosaur tracks gotta be careful

363
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:54,680
I got killed by bots. What do you mean got killed by bots? I played one game and won

364
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,160
I got the chicken dinner

365
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,640
I didn't I I got I played it once

366
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:12,660
You play with bots until level five and I was level 14 in that video. Go look at him

367
00:33:13,769 --> 00:33:19,210
My I know my username. It's like aragon or something. I did like a look at me lord of the rings thing when I was lying in bed

368
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,690
You can look that up

369
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:27,220
I was a little 14

370
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:31,930
So I was playing with

371
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:34,839
Like can I use this?

372
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:37,240
What in the whoa? Okay

373
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:40,920
Should I put should I hide this?

374
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:53,430
Why would they give this to me? Are there monsters in this level?

375
00:33:57,049 --> 00:33:59,450
Uh, okay. Well, I need to make sure I know what this is

376
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:04,680
I'm gonna put this right next to the slosh of matic

377
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,659
Because I will forget what that is halfway through this game

378
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:14,570
All right, i'm not looking too bad over here

379
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:17,340
Except for right there, but I got it

380
00:34:19,019 --> 00:34:22,280
Uh-oh

381
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,300
No, I got i'm fine. We're good

382
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,460
Fix his bullet holes. Okay. Okay

383
00:34:29,849 --> 00:34:32,579
Thanks for the tip man

384
00:34:32,579 --> 00:34:37,059
Read chat read chat. I I I am what i've been reading this whole time

385
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:46,199
I've been reading so much of the chat room. Yeah, one would say I might be reading too much chat

386
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:52,489
So i'm gonna go on chat restriction i'm not gonna look at chat for like a full two minutes I promise

387
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:03,639
Okay

388
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:08,650
All right looks good

389
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:12,250
This thing I don't know what the hell this thing's for. I'm sure i'll find out somebody will be

390
00:35:12,889 --> 00:35:15,980
screaming at me

391
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:19,900
I'm gonna walk by the thing. I'm gonna walk by the toilet seat thing like four times

392
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:28,420
How do we look? All right. This is not bad

393
00:35:31,059 --> 00:35:33,219
Does this count as trash? It probably does

394
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:38,780
There's uh, there's paint cans over there. All right. Hold on. Let me clean this up

395
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:54,090
Get rid of this

396
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:58,250
Mike muted. Oh, he's reading chat again. That's been two minutes

397
00:35:58,969 --> 00:36:07,079
Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. That's the one thing I read the thing that I know is not real

398
00:36:09,099 --> 00:36:11,500
If mike muted, that's the first thing I read

399
00:36:12,219 --> 00:36:18,119
Let's get it. Sometimes I look over and the chat's just sprinting by so that's why I have to pick something out and read it

400
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,760
Like for instance somebody just said say banana

401
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,280
Okay

402
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:37,780
Looks good. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay

403
00:36:38,739 --> 00:36:42,460
Oh, yeah, right. That's keep that there

404
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,900
Toilet seat, uh, I don't need this

405
00:36:46,539 --> 00:36:48,309
What is this stuff?

406
00:36:48,309 --> 00:36:50,309
warning cryogenic storage

407
00:36:57,849 --> 00:37:03,190
Okay

408
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:05,590
Okay

409
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:10,949
I don't know why that's making me laugh. It shouldn't that's not even I don't know why that's funny to me right now

410
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:22,840
If you're fast enough, you can read us all. Okay sour, please burn gun. Don't burn. No. Okay cryogenic. Haha

411
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:25,320
Do tongue twisters while cleaning stuff. Jeremy you have

412
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,480
Uh, no buttons Joe. Okay, sorry got it. That's as much as I could do

413
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:40,070
Can't do any more than that. I'm gonna take this down the hall

414
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:50,949
All right. Speaking of ipad music, that's ipad game music. I need something else

415
00:37:55,929 --> 00:38:02,599
Is there monster noise?

416
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:05,480
Doom ost now i'm never gonna play the doom ost ever again

417
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:12,360
I've played the doom ost more than anyone on this whole website. I could probably bet any amount of money

418
00:38:14,389 --> 00:38:16,469
If you take a look at twitch statistic somewhere

419
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:22,980
Who has played the doom soundtrack the most on on every between every account

420
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,460
I would be probably up. I would have like a huge advantage already

421
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:37,900
German mustard ost. What was that?

422
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:50,500
Play the persona 5 ost. No. All right. Hold on a second here guys. I need somebody to tell me this because I

423
00:38:51,769 --> 00:38:53,769
Did I ask this question already before?

424
00:38:54,309 --> 00:38:56,309
I think I may have asked this question before

425
00:38:56,789 --> 00:38:58,789
What the fuck is persona 5?

426
00:38:59,449 --> 00:39:01,610
Did I ask this?

427
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:10,489
Is it it's like a life simulator. I tried watch the trailer and I couldn't figure out what the game was

428
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,239
He's hitting

429
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:16,679
Balls in a batting cage. He's talking to somebody like a coffee shop

430
00:39:18,659 --> 00:39:25,289
I don't know what the game is

431
00:39:25,289 --> 00:39:27,690
It's a turn-based fighting game with social stuff

432
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,380
because

433
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,380
Persona 3 was a full-on

434
00:39:34,949 --> 00:39:37,030
turn-based rpg

435
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:38,869
Is that the same game?

436
00:39:38,869 --> 00:39:52,650
Is that the same like are they the similar genres or they different persona 3 had social bits

437
00:39:58,059 --> 00:39:59,820
Same game but better

438
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:06,969
Oh get in there

439
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:09,059
Get in there

440
00:40:09,059 --> 00:40:11,059
Why what's in the way?

441
00:40:11,059 --> 00:40:13,059
There's nothing in the way what?

442
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,300
Get your body in there. Okay

443
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:28,980
Mafia city ost that's not gonna happen. Whoa. Hold on a second medical

444
00:40:29,619 --> 00:40:35,380
I don't really need to get rid of this. There's nothing wrong with it

445
00:40:43,059 --> 00:40:50,300
I you know, I would put on the star wars ost, but i'll probably go to prison so I can't do that guys. Sorry

446
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:13,719
You know, it would be like funny like somebody play like put put a youtube video up

447
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:15,880
you play

448
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,519
oh, here's the uh, here's the full ost of

449
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:21,340
star wars

450
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:24,300
Just start with like the empire strikes back music the empire music

451
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,880
And then intercut in the middle like a siren

452
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:31,860
That would be kind of funny. That would be like a really really funny joke. I think

453
00:41:32,579 --> 00:41:36,730
so it'd be like

454
00:41:36,969 --> 00:41:38,969
Uh

455
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:46,489
That would be a bad joke that's the worst joke of 2019 that's worse joke in the last five years

456
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:51,960
That's the worst joke in the last 10 years. That's the worst thing i've ever said

457
00:41:52,519 --> 00:41:55,239
Ever and I mean ever and i'm talking about in my life

458
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:02,539
In my whole fucking life and 3,500 people just heard it

459
00:42:03,659 --> 00:42:07,579
Oh, I just spit all over my mouth because in the middle of that. I was like abort. This is not good

460
00:42:07,579 --> 00:42:11,500
This is not funny, but my brain was like no just keep just try to just try to hash it out

461
00:42:12,139 --> 00:42:14,139
Nope, that's the worst thing i've ever said

462
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,400
It was such a better way to do that too

463
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,380
Oh

464
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:40,469
All right. I'm gonna like turn the stream off and turn it back on and pretend we just started

465
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:54,440
It was the whole package

466
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:57,079
I knew it was gonna be bad too, but sometimes something you gotta commit

467
00:42:59,769 --> 00:43:02,809
You can tell that I was having strong conflicting opinions of it, too

468
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:09,880
After the first like dun dun dun dun you can hear my voice like stop and then to say something else change it

469
00:43:11,659 --> 00:43:18,090
I didn't change the channel. I stayed on fucking qvc. What am I doing?

470
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:40,170
No, no, hey, all right, it's time to start it over. Hey everybody. Welcome to the stream

471
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,250
I'm peeking the microphone right now

472
00:43:47,579 --> 00:43:49,579
Did I have I've been peeking?

473
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:54,469
Who just gave money?

474
00:43:54,469 --> 00:43:56,469
Stormy chew just gave 50 dollars

475
00:43:59,829 --> 00:44:03,909
Thank you so much stormy chew

476
00:44:03,909 --> 00:44:07,829
Hey german chat been a while since i've been able to watch your streams due to my new time zone

477
00:44:08,389 --> 00:44:09,989
but just wanted to say

478
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:14,150
Uh, keep being great. You deserve this. I also hope you and chat had a good new year. Thank you

479
00:44:14,789 --> 00:44:17,320
Stormy chew. Hope you had a great

480
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,320
New year's eve. Hope you have a great new year

481
00:44:22,039 --> 00:44:24,039
Thank you so much for the 50 dollars

482
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:36,630
That's a lot of fucking money

483
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:38,630
No, i'm not doing the joke again

484
00:44:38,789 --> 00:44:43,670
no

485
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:45,670
50 dollars start of the stream. Yeah

486
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:48,309
I'll say it. I'll say it again

487
00:44:48,949 --> 00:44:53,619
Sometimes people come in here and they just drop fucking huge money

488
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,980
And you know, it's been not even 45 minutes

489
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:14,619
Thank you, that's fucking ridiculous. Thank you weird flex. No, no i'm saying i'm saying that I can't believe it

490
00:45:23,849 --> 00:45:27,289
You know what it's been a few minutes i'm starting to like it I think I like that joke though

491
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,500
Yeah, don't delete the spot. Keep it up

492
00:45:40,389 --> 00:45:48,739
Mitchell just gave five community subs. Thank you so much. Mitchell. I'll pay 50 dollars if you never make that joke ever again

493
00:45:49,539 --> 00:45:52,900
Well, I can promise you that i'll never make that joke ever again. Why would I do that again?

494
00:45:56,889 --> 00:46:01,610
I'm not gonna double down on the embarrassing fucking terrible dumb shitty joke. I just made it

495
00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:06,010
That wasn't even a joke. It was me pretending. I was watching a youtube video, but there's no context there

496
00:46:06,969 --> 00:46:08,650
I tried to give context in 10 seconds

497
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:13,369
And it just that don't work like that if I made that video and played it on stream, that would be funny

498
00:46:13,929 --> 00:46:20,820
It'd be really funny if I actually made that video and like put it. Hey, there's here's like an ost for star wars

499
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:36,250
Now that's funny

500
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:40,599
No, it's not

501
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:43,239
I think that's kind of funny if I didn't say anything about it before

502
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:47,900
I think I'd get a few

503
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:51,579
I would get two L's and then a circle in the middle from some people in the chat. I think

504
00:46:52,139 --> 00:46:56,300
All right. This is looking this is looking good

505
00:46:57,059 --> 00:46:58,579
I like this so far

506
00:46:58,579 --> 00:47:04,119
Let's move this up

507
00:47:04,119 --> 00:47:07,159
Put on some music. All right. What are we gonna put on for music? Let's get something good

508
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,880
Something that we can all hang out and enjoy

509
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:16,489
By the way for every doom ost I see in the chat. I'm going to repeat the siren joke

510
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:31,940
A full cycle. I sometimes I forget. Oh, yeah people want me to like embarrass myself. Sometimes I forget about that

511
00:47:38,489 --> 00:47:40,489
Put on plock

512
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:42,650
Plock ost what?

513
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:46,659
Holy shit. That's like a decade ago. I remember plock

514
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:53,639
Plock ost

515
00:47:53,639 --> 00:47:57,750
This is an old one. This is this is the the

516
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:00,869
You throw your limbs, right?

517
00:48:00,869 --> 00:48:12,980
Okay, is that a good volume? I think so

518
00:48:28,409 --> 00:48:31,449
That's rocky

519
00:48:31,449 --> 00:48:36,710
This is just rocky

520
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:39,190
That's cool

521
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:41,190
I have a siren place

522
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:55,909
All right, was that the intro can you recreate an acapella version of the song that you just heard

523
00:48:58,949 --> 00:49:00,550
What no what?

524
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:07,139
Pretty good banjo kazooie song

525
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:19,269
I need that thing in here

526
00:49:19,269 --> 00:49:21,269
Oh

527
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:45,460
How fucked up is it going to be when they finally make banjo kazooie 3

528
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,440
And it's fully voice acted and they ruin everything

529
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:56,889
No, no, no, don't pick up the torso

530
00:49:57,449 --> 00:49:59,449
Banjo is gonna be fucking chris pratt

531
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:04,059
Oh, I needed that

532
00:50:04,059 --> 00:50:18,789
Am I no i'm not tracking now i'll do banjo kazooie. Yeah, i'll do banjo kazooie ost

533
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:33,980
Get these limbs in here

534
00:50:34,139 --> 00:50:35,739
Somebody got a uh

535
00:50:35,739 --> 00:50:42,250
Somebody got the rocket launcher in the other room. This guy is in a hundred pieces

536
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:49,559
I have you muted and i'm playing the doom ost because you refuse to

537
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:54,039
why

538
00:50:54,039 --> 00:50:55,880
Why can't

539
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:57,860
That's such a

540
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:00,340
That's such a passive aggressive thing to say

541
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:06,460
Or is that regular aggressive? I don't know

542
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:11,320
Can I play chungo ost? I don't know what that is

543
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:17,719
I like I don't cronk pull the lever. I don't know what that is. Like I don't get it

544
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:35,559
All right, I think this can fit in here

545
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:40,199
What do I do with the stinger?

546
00:51:40,199 --> 00:51:42,199
That's too awkward. It's gonna go in by itself

547
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:47,670
Any more little bits?

548
00:51:47,670 --> 00:52:01,539
I'm gonna play this song at my wedding

549
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:03,619
and now introducing

550
00:52:03,619 --> 00:52:05,619
Mr. And mrs. Elbertson

551
00:52:06,579 --> 00:52:09,300
I'm gonna really fucking piss off my grandfather

552
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:31,480
What the hell?

553
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:36,780
Unbelievable. What is this music? This is not closing time from green day. Oh terrible wedding

554
00:52:45,429 --> 00:52:53,019
Oh, this is dirty. No, they're not closing time. What's what's the green day song?

555
00:52:56,650 --> 00:53:02,650
The song does not even please fall if he had it why I hope you have a high high

556
00:53:02,730 --> 00:53:03,849
What is that one?

557
00:53:03,849 --> 00:53:11,510
That one's called good riddance

558
00:53:11,510 --> 00:53:13,510
No, no, no, it's called time of your life, right?

559
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:23,050
That's what i'm talking about

560
00:53:23,050 --> 00:53:25,849
Wait, actually, maybe good riddance probably doesn't sound like a good song for a wedding

561
00:53:26,409 --> 00:53:31,880
good riddance

562
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:34,599
What's like the graduation one? No, it's closing time

563
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:38,440
That's the graduation wedding

564
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:41,239
You did it celebration song. Yeah closing time

565
00:53:45,610 --> 00:53:48,420
Graduation is good riddance

566
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:50,409
What?

567
00:53:50,409 --> 00:53:52,989
No, no, there's two different songs here. There's

568
00:53:58,090 --> 00:54:00,090
And then there's

569
00:54:07,179 --> 00:54:09,820
I'm sorry this music started playing and it fucked up everything

570
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:13,539
It started playing that fucking alien music

571
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:22,500
The alien music really screwed it up

572
00:54:22,659 --> 00:54:25,139
Didn't spill it. I win. I win. I win

573
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:55,750
I remember this level jojo part five ost

574
00:54:57,110 --> 00:54:59,750
Now i'm not going to play anything jojo related on the stream

575
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:12,599
Nothing to do about don't

576
00:55:15,989 --> 00:55:17,909
That is actually

577
00:55:17,909 --> 00:55:19,909
Really really cool painting

578
00:55:21,179 --> 00:55:23,659
Get a frame on that frame that up one, two, three four

579
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:27,980
Give it a good title and sell it

580
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:36,230
You'll make some fucking money

581
00:55:36,230 --> 00:55:44,579
Really?

582
00:55:44,579 --> 00:55:48,019
Actually, I really do like the way that looks that's what my new desktop background

583
00:55:48,739 --> 00:55:54,500
I said that really weirdly desktop background

584
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:07,579
Should have screen shot of that. Yeah, I know fuck

585
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:09,500
You're right

586
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:10,619

587
00:56:10,619 --> 00:56:21,769

00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:48,900
Great. Thanks. Thanks for nothing

590
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:54,179
The incinerator has two doors. Yeah, but then you're losing the

591
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:56,760
does the

592
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:01,369
You have to have one side closed. Otherwise all the air and the oxygen gets all fucked up. You need to have

593
00:57:02,489 --> 00:57:04,489
This doesn't make the fire too crazy

594
00:57:05,719 --> 00:57:08,519
Two doors open and let's all the oxygen out and then the fire goes out

595
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:12,170
Have you guys been camping before?

596
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:17,179
What do you think that accordion does when you stick the accordion in and you go?

597
00:57:21,219 --> 00:57:27,750
The billow I need to bring in some

598
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:45,030
You bring it in

599
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:50,090
Yeah, what are you gonna do about the trash

600
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:59,639
What are you gonna do all with the fucking electronics the ipods?

601
00:58:01,699 --> 00:58:03,739
All the takeout

602
00:58:03,739 --> 00:58:06,139
Well, you guys don't order postmates to your tent

603
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:10,420
You're not doing it, right?

604
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:23,139
I forgot to get a bucket

605
00:58:23,139 --> 00:58:24,260

606
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:55,739
Quake bunny hopping that was an extreme spill joke. How's this for extreme? All right, it's right here. We good

607
00:58:56,219 --> 00:59:08,420
Don't you guys understand? Here's the here's the thing

00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:10,980
So a lot of people that are coming in going like what the fuck is this guy doing?

609
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:13,989
What's wrong with this person?

610
00:59:13,989 --> 00:59:18,230
When I do when I sit here and I get to just I don't have to pay attention to anything

611
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:25,909
You know, this is just cleaning we can just hang out and just talk shit. This is what happens

612
00:59:35,590 --> 00:59:37,590
My brain gets contained

613
00:59:38,010 --> 00:59:40,010
When I have to focus on something else

614
00:59:45,349 --> 00:59:47,349
My hair is up in like a fucking bun

615
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:51,190
When i'm streaming like a normal video game, my hair is down right now

No, I don't want to look over and see he did it

623
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:44,170
Or no, it's all right. We did it

624
01:00:45,530 --> 01:01:09,210
Come here

625
01:01:09,210 --> 01:01:19,190
Uh, do we need to do this? I'll get rid of the barrels too. I'm gonna fuck it up. I'm getting rid of everything

626
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:29,739
Yeah, what the fuck is in the way?

627
01:01:29,739 --> 01:01:39,530
Get in there

628
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:56,650
What? Oh, they're going off the other side

629
01:01:58,710 --> 01:02:00,760
All right

630
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:05,239
We're almost the clock is almost done

631
01:02:05,239 --> 01:02:08,119
Bring this over here. Just fucking whip it over there. No, don't

01:02:14,519 --> 01:02:19,780
No, no blood. We're good

Mafia city ost. No, I haven't seen any good. I have not seen one good ost

634
01:02:27,590 --> 01:02:44,329
You guys can do better than this. I know you can near automata

635
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:47,260
No, I don't want to do near automata

636
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:50,179
I'd rather play it

637
01:02:50,179 --> 01:02:52,420
I don't want to experience the music yet until I play it

638
01:03:03,179 --> 01:03:09,050
Damn, this is dirty mother three you wanker

639
01:03:11,690 --> 01:03:18,119

No, I don't want to play any copywritten. I don't want to play any actual real copywritten music

643
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:56,630
I'm not going to play star wars

644
01:03:57,030 --> 01:04:05,739
I think you guys understand that

645
01:04:05,739 --> 01:04:08,460
The disney ceo has an alarm clock

646
01:04:10,059 --> 01:04:11,340
that just

647
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:13,460
buzzes

648
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:18,500
And somebody is watching or viewing star wars or listening to star wars music illegally

649
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:28,280
And he has a speed dial

650
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:30,280
from one of the five thousand lawyers

651
01:04:34,630 --> 01:04:36,630
He doesn't even give a shit if it's the middle of the night

652
01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:39,110
before in the morning

653
01:04:40,550 --> 01:04:48,780
Who's watching star wars his wife just turns over and it's just like

01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:53,059
Hold on. Sorry, sweetie

655

01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:21,340
Then that I can't you know what I mean?

658
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:25,179
I need to know what it's like first. I have to experience it first

659
01:05:26,579 --> 01:05:28,579
We got to go with stuff that i've experienced

660
01:05:32,329 --> 01:05:35,429

661
01:05:35,429 --> 01:05:38,789

662
01:05:40,150 --> 01:05:41,110

663
01:05:41,110 --> 01:05:43,750
Use like one of those auto tuners to every time i've spilled something

664
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:55,860

01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:03,960
I don't hate it

667
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:14,780
I haven't heard that song in a long time

668
01:06:22,550 --> 01:06:24,230
I got a better idea

669
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:27,010
Why don't we play?

670
01:06:27,010 --> 01:06:29,670
WWF the music volume 2

671
01:06:30,309 --> 01:06:40,340
That sounds like a pretty good idea

672
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:43,820
Oh don't break anything

673
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:45,900
Actually good. Uh, yeah

674
01:06:46,139 --> 01:06:49,079
All right. If a magician can do it I can too

675
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:57,210
Apparently not

676
01:06:57,210 --> 01:06:59,210
I just rolled that no open it

677
01:06:59,690 --> 01:07:00,969
open

678
01:07:00,969 --> 01:07:11,510
We're gonna play a game. We're gonna play every wwf the music volume

679
01:07:12,150 --> 01:07:14,150
And we're gonna see if I can tell you who it is

680
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:23,699
Just based on their entry music now i'm curious now i'm curious as to hold on. I just got

681
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:27,320
I just got an achievement for doing that. I need to see something here

682
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:31,320
I let me save this because if there's a I don't they might be a problem here

683
01:07:32,039 --> 01:07:34,039
So I need to save this

684
01:07:34,039 --> 01:07:40,280
That was plock. That was pretty good. Everybody loves plock

685
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:42,920
All right, wwf the music

686
01:07:43,639 --> 01:07:44,760
volume

687
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:59,190
One are you ready? Uh, let's see if I can get these all you're playing

688
01:08:05,929 --> 01:08:11,780
Uh, this one's coming out of like one ear. So let's try the other one

689
01:08:15,530 --> 01:08:19,560
Okay, let's see if I can figure all these out

690
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:25,579
This is the undertaker. All right, I already know it's the undertaker

691
01:08:27,479 --> 01:08:34,899
I already got it and he goes

692
01:08:45,739 --> 01:08:55,399
Told you

693
01:08:59,319 --> 01:09:03,100
I miss old undertaker

694
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:33,989
Give me a couple of these

695
01:09:33,989 --> 01:09:35,989
I miss old germa

696
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:47,210
Do you though? Do you really you miss modern warfare 3 and minecraft and speed?

697
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,119
Be certain about this

698
01:09:52,119 --> 01:10:16,649
Well, at least no don't make that not funny

699
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:38,170
Clean clean dirty ceiling not clean i'll take care of that right now

700
01:10:39,130 --> 01:10:59,399
So I know close this side. I don't need it open

701
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:09,270
Yeah, this is before he had the uh, like the rock music. This is original undertaker

702
01:11:09,989 --> 01:11:11,350
paul bearer

703
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:21,539
Oh, no, don't don't if you if you're in the chat right now, don't look at the chat

704
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:27,699
Don't even look at it, but i'm one for one right now

705
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:37,939
I wonder who's next the stone cold is gonna be on here. The rock's gonna be on here volume two

706
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:52,010
This is 1997 98. I wonder who else is on here. It's definitely gonna be stone cold. Who's next?

707
01:12:07,930 --> 01:12:09,930
You are completely pathetic

708
01:12:16,579 --> 01:12:19,300
All right, it's stone cold, I don't remember that part

709
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:27,960
I don't remember him saying that I didn't that didn't sound like steve austin

710
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:35,430
This shit's fucking loud

711
01:12:35,430 --> 01:12:39,189
That's a little bit better

712
01:12:39,189 --> 01:12:51,460
Decibel volume this room is pretty much done. I gotta get off the top there though. Don't I?

713
01:12:52,539 --> 01:12:55,819
Look at the spot i'm missing over there. I can get that watch this

714
01:12:57,819 --> 01:13:08,380
You know you can start begging for some mercy right now

715
01:13:08,779 --> 01:13:14,859
Because you ain't got what it takes to stay in the ring where stone cold steve austin from bell to bell

716
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:19,180
When did he narrate this song? I don't remember that

717
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:25,800
I'd no I could I think I could

718
01:13:26,180 --> 01:13:29,859
I think I could take one full closed fisted punch as hard as he could in the face

719
01:13:31,739 --> 01:13:34,380
And then that would be it I'd have to go to the hospital but I think I could do it

720
01:13:41,590 --> 01:13:47,350
Like i'm talking he goes off the ropes as fast as he can and double crow hop sprint punches me in the face as hard

721
01:13:47,350 --> 01:13:49,500
As he can

722
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:51,500
I think I could do it

723
01:14:01,939 --> 01:14:03,939
How does that why can I not be like you

724
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:20,090
What the fuck stop are we gonna get any more?

725
01:14:20,489 --> 01:14:25,689
Oh, okay, we're gonna get any more like pull the string on the back of the toy and give one of my four catchphrases

726
01:14:32,140 --> 01:14:40,199
Got it. Fuck is that enough?

727
01:14:57,670 --> 01:14:59,670
That's the bottom line

728
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:05,060
All right. Yeah, that's that's why he actually had things. He said he didn't just go what?

729
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:07,560
What?

730
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:15,189
I don't know who this is

731
01:15:15,189 --> 01:15:31,079
Who is this familiar? But I don't know who this is not john cena john cena wasn't even alive right now

732
01:15:33,270 --> 01:15:35,510
John cena john cena was like four years old

733
01:15:36,229 --> 01:15:45,659
All right, almost down with this room. It looks very clean

734
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:54,569
Oh fuck there's knives

735
01:15:54,569 --> 01:15:56,569
Shit, can I reach this?

736
01:15:56,569 --> 01:16:02,840
Did I ruin that forever? No, I didn't right?

737
01:16:03,159 --> 01:16:12,739
I got it one little knife

738
01:16:17,539 --> 01:16:31,819
That's matching up with the music

739
01:16:31,819 --> 01:16:35,579
Looks pretty good. I'm almost happy with it. Not quite

740
01:16:36,140 --> 01:16:38,680
This is a watch. That's a nice pocket watch

741
01:16:42,390 --> 01:16:44,390
Did you know that i'm three years?

742
01:16:47,239 --> 01:16:49,239
Three years older than john cena

743
01:16:50,489 --> 01:16:54,890
Uh john cena is like 41 so I don't think that's correct

744
01:16:55,609 --> 01:17:11,060
Three years older than john cena. I know

745
01:17:14,279 --> 01:17:16,439
I know john cena is older than me

746
01:17:17,079 --> 01:17:19,300
because

747
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:23,619
You don't do the i'm in random christmas movies with mark walberg

748
01:17:23,779 --> 01:17:27,859
Unless your career is now turning into like you're older and you don't do what you used to do anymore

749
01:17:33,319 --> 01:17:51,619
Uh, he's he's not like 32. He can still shoulder block the same way

750
01:17:54,199 --> 01:17:55,319
What

751
01:17:55,319 --> 01:17:58,119
I don't even know what that means. I haven't watched john cena wrestle

752
01:18:00,310 --> 01:18:02,310
I don't know what he I don't even know what he looks like

753
01:18:04,729 --> 01:18:09,850
If you had like seven john cena's in a lineup, I don't know if I could figure out which one is the real john cena

754
01:18:10,489 --> 01:18:31,529
All right. Well that was that was not john cena. Is this uh, oh who is this? This is uh

755
01:18:33,539 --> 01:18:36,600
Who the fuck is this?

756
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:38,199
I think this is

757
01:18:38,199 --> 01:18:43,460
sable

758
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:48,199
Is it?

759
01:18:48,199 --> 01:18:50,199
Like cat screams

760
01:18:51,939 --> 01:19:04,739
Did I get it right I don't

761
01:19:34,579 --> 01:19:35,619
No

762
01:19:35,619 --> 01:19:49,220
No

763
01:19:49,220 --> 01:19:51,220
Nobody knows a run

764
01:20:00,170 --> 01:20:02,170
Uh, i'm not listening for anything

765
01:20:05,369 --> 01:20:13,029
I

766
01:20:13,029 --> 01:20:16,699
Oh, all right

767
01:20:16,699 --> 01:20:19,500
I gotta compose myself here. I'm fucking losing my mind

768
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:27,100
Oh, look at all this trash

769
01:20:27,340 --> 01:20:29,500
No, there's too much trash over here. Hold on

770
01:20:52,170 --> 01:20:54,170
I don't even know what to say

771
01:20:56,220 --> 01:20:58,220
I gotta play the game

772
01:21:01,029 --> 01:21:04,630
Oh nobody don't even whatever i'm flaying

773
01:21:05,510 --> 01:21:11,420
Did I tip it? I did

774
01:21:11,420 --> 01:21:13,430
oops

775
01:21:13,430 --> 01:21:16,630
Okay. Well that was uh, I don't know who that was

776
01:21:17,189 --> 01:21:20,260
I thought it was sable

777
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:28,279
Uh, is this the undertaker? No, this is the undertaker's alter ego like the overtaker

778
01:21:29,819 --> 01:21:31,579
And he's like nice

779
01:21:31,579 --> 01:21:35,989
He's not like a demon. He's from heaven

780
01:21:39,199 --> 01:21:41,500
Mustang sally

781
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:42,460
What?

782
01:21:42,460 --> 01:21:58,229
I don't know

783
01:21:58,229 --> 01:22:06,489
I don't know who the hell this is

784
01:22:07,210 --> 01:22:10,090
This is the era that I watched the most

785
01:22:11,159 --> 01:22:13,159
And I don't know who this is

786
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:20,680
So much copywritten music

787
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:22,840
I don't think anyone's gonna dmca this

788
01:22:27,829 --> 01:22:32,869
Who even has the rights to the music volume 2 the company's probably defunct at this point

789
01:22:37,939 --> 01:22:39,939
This company probably went bankrupt in like

790
01:22:40,399 --> 01:22:49,760
2004

791
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:56,739
WWE well wwe is licenses it out. But who dmc ww doesn't dmce claim

792
01:23:07,449 --> 01:23:13,350
They do

793
01:23:13,350 --> 01:23:15,109
This song goes on for

794
01:23:15,109 --> 01:23:21,960
How long is this song?

795
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:28,739
Okay. Well, let's turn that off then

796
01:23:40,090 --> 01:23:42,520
Mother three ost. Nah

797
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:43,720
Nah

798
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:46,789
Oh, let's see

799
01:23:46,789 --> 01:23:50,869
Jenga ost. I don't understand. Is that just like a family playing jenga in the living room?

800
01:23:56,359 --> 01:23:58,359
Banjo kazooie. There it is

801
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:02,779
Absolutely

802
01:24:02,779 --> 01:24:05,359
There it is full banjo kazooie soundtrack

803
01:24:08,739 --> 01:24:21,189
Oops try that again. Let's try that again

804
01:24:21,750 --> 01:24:28,359
Okay

805
01:24:28,359 --> 01:24:45,829
All right, let's do it. Let's try it again

806
01:24:53,779 --> 01:24:54,819
That's right

807
01:24:54,819 --> 01:25:05,619
I thought the whole thing was on fire for a second sauteed fucking money so much

808
01:25:06,340 --> 01:25:10,420
Where the fuck were they this generation with another banjo kazooie? They don't like to do anything

809
01:25:10,420 --> 01:25:12,579
But have crackdown three take five years

810
01:25:13,380 --> 01:25:18,390
Remember when you could drive her out of the car in the last one

811
01:25:19,029 --> 01:25:33,189
This one's done

812
01:25:33,189 --> 01:25:35,029
Ha ha

813
01:25:35,029 --> 01:25:37,829
Shouldn't be ha haing me. You should have yeah, you should actually

814
01:25:38,470 --> 01:25:40,020
You should

815
01:25:40,020 --> 01:25:53,699
Uh, but we're honest to god though. Let's let's

816
01:25:54,579 --> 01:25:55,939
stop fucking

817
01:25:55,939 --> 01:25:57,939
Talking for a second and talk

818
01:25:58,789 --> 01:26:00,939
uh

819
01:26:00,939 --> 01:26:03,619
Microsoft buys rare

820
01:26:03,619 --> 01:26:06,819
They make a lego build cars game for banjo

821
01:26:09,829 --> 01:26:14,789
Microsoft then teases a joke about conquer's bad for a day in project bankrupt spark

822
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:32,460
Why what happened?

823
01:26:32,460 --> 01:26:34,069
I don't understand

824
01:26:34,069 --> 01:26:36,069
Why would you even buy?

825
01:26:36,229 --> 01:26:37,270
rare

826
01:26:37,270 --> 01:26:40,789
You have all these insanely amazing beloved licenses

827
01:26:43,770 --> 01:26:47,850
And they've turned them into like serial characters. They don't what what have they done?

828
01:26:49,159 --> 01:26:51,159
Cage in the corner cage in the corner. Hold on

829
01:26:51,720 --> 01:27:01,029
I got it. I got it. I got it because Microsoft hates fun

830
01:27:02,649 --> 01:27:05,449
If there was a real banjo kazooie 3 that came up

831
01:27:06,090 --> 01:27:09,670
And it was actually just banjo cuz and look i'm not even i'm not gonna tell you that

832
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:14,760
Oh my god, I love banjo so much. I'm a huge banjo fan. Not really

833
01:27:15,399 --> 01:27:18,279
You know, it's fun. It was really interesting for the time. But

834
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,880
You know how many people would buy that game just because it has the number three on it

835
01:27:24,220 --> 01:27:27,979
That'd be the probably the fastest selling console game in the last probably 10 years

836
01:27:28,779 --> 01:27:41,479
Can I get in here?

837
01:27:41,479 --> 01:27:46,600
No, it wouldn't are you sure about that? You know, I think you underestimate just how many people are starving

838
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:49,720
For another game like that

839
01:27:50,420 --> 01:27:54,340
They might not they might be looking for rose-colored glasses there or whatever, right?

840
01:28:00,090 --> 01:28:07,739
Is he high?

841
01:28:07,739 --> 01:28:08,939
me

842
01:28:08,939 --> 01:28:16,699
Or phil spencer

843
01:28:16,699 --> 01:28:21,500
me

844
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:30,310
Both of you

845
01:28:30,310 --> 01:28:38,170
I just got gnomed. I told you you guys find it everywhere now

846
01:28:40,729 --> 01:28:45,050
anytime somebody says or makes a utterance of the word like

847
01:28:47,420 --> 01:28:49,420
Or like oh

848
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:51,500
There's thousands of those instances

849
01:28:51,819 --> 01:28:59,880
All right. This one's done. We've got a clean room here

850
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:04,890
At least I think so. I might be wrong, but just triple check and give me out the

851
01:29:05,850 --> 01:29:07,210
meter

852
01:29:07,210 --> 01:29:19,220
Looks good, right?

853
01:29:19,220 --> 01:29:21,220
Yeah, I don't want that. I don't like this anymore

854
01:29:26,170 --> 01:29:36,600
Uh, what am I gonna put on?

855
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:38,600
mario kart 64

856
01:29:40,170 --> 01:29:42,170
We need something that just sits in the background

857
01:29:42,329 --> 01:29:48,329
Something easy that sits in the background that could be dropped to like minus 20 decibels

858
01:29:55,350 --> 01:29:56,810
ry star

859
01:29:56,810 --> 01:30:03,829
That's an old one. What is with you in decibels? That's how

860
01:30:04,550 --> 01:30:09,109
Db that's the termination. That's the how you gauge how loud something is

861
01:30:09,590 --> 01:30:16,819
Especially when you have audio editing over here. It's db decibels minus five db zero db

862
01:30:17,300 --> 01:30:27,340
Minus 50 db. How about um the ps4 background music? No, I feel too trippy

863
01:30:36,100 --> 01:30:38,100
Audio is measured in volume

864
01:30:39,210 --> 01:30:42,819
um

865
01:30:42,819 --> 01:30:46,569
well

866
01:30:46,569 --> 01:30:52,170
Sound is measured in units called decibels db the higher the decibel level the louder the noise on the decibel scale

867
01:30:52,250 --> 01:30:57,609
The level increase of 10 means that a sound is actually 10 times more intense or powerful. It's the decibel scale

868
01:30:58,619 --> 01:31:16,060
db sound is measured in a unit called decibel. All right, donkey kong country is good. That's good

869
01:31:16,060 --> 01:31:21,739
You can just sit in the background

870
01:31:21,739 --> 01:31:23,500
Well, actually

871
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:31,100
Hey, you gotta speak up man. The decibels are low back here

872
01:31:38,649 --> 01:31:41,369
Finally some real music, but the music's fine

873
01:31:45,699 --> 01:31:47,699
Meter it's meters cubed

874
01:31:55,539 --> 01:31:58,020
Louder louder. Ah, fuck. It is too soft, isn't it?

875
01:32:03,270 --> 01:32:05,289
That's that's a good

876
01:32:05,289 --> 01:32:06,890
db level

877
01:32:06,890 --> 01:32:17,159
All right. We've got an hour and 30 minutes. I'm like almost done

878
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:35,770
And i'm gonna eat a whole pizza on stream. That's not gonna happen. Why is this thing broken? What's wrong with this thing?

879
01:32:36,250 --> 01:32:44,329
I don't make sure I got everything over here. Yeah, I have to bring this bucket back here

880
01:32:45,289 --> 01:32:47,779
Then there's no straight pieces in this room, right?

881
01:32:48,340 --> 01:32:50,039
I think it's good

882
01:32:50,039 --> 01:32:51,399
Close that up

883
01:32:51,399 --> 01:32:58,380
Still on the first floor. Yeah, I know

884
01:33:04,569 --> 01:33:06,810
Perfect looks pretty good

885
01:33:06,810 --> 01:33:20,710
It's still up. There's one. There's still a protractor here

886
01:33:21,270 --> 01:33:24,729
I think that's it though

887
01:33:24,729 --> 01:33:26,729
That's it, right? Yeah

888
01:33:27,289 --> 01:33:36,439
Good to go

889
01:33:36,439 --> 01:33:43,529
Move on to the next room

890
01:33:43,529 --> 01:33:46,699
Right here open it up

891
01:33:46,699 --> 01:33:49,750
All right

892
01:33:49,750 --> 01:33:50,869
Let's go

893
01:33:50,869 --> 01:34:01,859
Is there an incinerator in here?

894
01:34:01,859 --> 01:34:04,020
Do I have to actually bring the all the way back?

895
01:34:05,689 --> 01:34:07,689
Oh, this is gonna suck

896
01:34:07,850 --> 01:34:14,470
This is gonna be so horrible. I have to put them. I gotta bring a bunch of shit in here

897
01:34:15,270 --> 01:34:20,630
Can I open this or something?

898
01:34:20,630 --> 01:34:39,779
What is this for? Whoa. Well, that's really useful

899
01:34:42,420 --> 01:34:44,100
I could have used that

900
01:34:44,100 --> 01:34:47,060
What was this in the santa level? I could have used that a thousand times

901
01:34:58,939 --> 01:35:00,819
Really could have used that

902
01:35:00,819 --> 01:35:02,979
All right. Uh, I need a couple of the

903
01:35:03,699 --> 01:35:07,100
I need a couple of these

904
01:35:07,180 --> 01:35:08,810
and

905
01:35:08,810 --> 01:35:12,489
Um, do I want to do this room? Yeah, I probably do. I'm gonna bring three of these in here

906
01:35:12,569 --> 01:35:14,569
Look at how much shit is in this. Ah

907
01:35:14,970 --> 01:35:18,390
I gotta fill every bucket. I need like five buckets

908
01:35:18,949 --> 01:35:23,619
I'm gonna do this. Correct

909
01:35:23,619 --> 01:35:25,939
Lake thank you lake drinker for the five community subs

910
01:35:27,510 --> 01:35:35,210
Lake drinker

911
01:35:35,210 --> 01:35:37,300
Thank you so much

912
01:35:37,300 --> 01:35:45,399
Look left

913
01:35:45,399 --> 01:35:47,880
Okay, we can clean up that we can do the little cleanup later

914
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:57,979
Look left look left. I just I gotta get this set up

915
01:35:58,699 --> 01:36:01,699
Just give me a minute

916
01:36:01,699 --> 01:36:04,020
This is okay. I gotta designate this shit

917
01:36:04,979 --> 01:36:06,979
This is for this corner

918
01:36:07,850 --> 01:36:09,850
All these body parts need to go in these two

919
01:36:10,649 --> 01:36:22,569
Should fit

920
01:36:22,569 --> 01:36:27,829
Okay, derma your feet. I'm i'm fine

921
01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:30,840
I'm fine. I did it demo this

922
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:33,909
You want to get rid of this?

923
01:36:33,909 --> 01:36:41,880
Look left. Oh, I oh this is horrible. Oh, what have I done?

924
01:36:42,520 --> 01:36:45,079
Just throw them in here. I'll get them later

925
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,180
Take your socks off

926
01:36:49,180 --> 01:37:08,250
I don't think i'm gonna do that

927
01:37:08,250 --> 01:37:13,210
There's another room on my left is there

928
01:37:13,770 --> 01:37:19,189
I mean I say I know this room here. What's wrong with this room?

929
01:37:21,720 --> 01:37:23,720
Holy shit, that looks kind of crazy. Can I activate this?

930
01:37:30,060 --> 01:37:35,689
They could they don't come out of there. Did they those guys come out?

931
01:37:45,100 --> 01:37:52,060
Uh, give me the gun

932
01:37:52,060 --> 01:37:59,420
I'm not fucking around in there

933
01:37:59,420 --> 01:38:07,699
Come on out. That's a display. They don't come out

934
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:16,949
Right. What the hell is this?

935
01:38:18,949 --> 01:38:22,869
The results are more than I could have hoped for my creation is showing a great increased pain threshold and soon

936
01:38:22,949 --> 01:38:25,510
Would be my crowning achievement ultimate proof that I was right

937
01:38:26,229 --> 01:38:31,989
This is the critical phase of the experiment one. I cannot afford to get them wrong his siblings grow restless now. I must tend to them

938
01:38:41,020 --> 01:38:44,260
Okay

939
01:38:44,260 --> 01:38:50,119
Uh, I don't like this room. I really don't that just scared me. I thought he got up

940
01:38:50,840 --> 01:38:53,590
I thought he was gonna just plop me right there

941
01:38:54,380 --> 01:38:55,739
Uh

942
01:38:55,739 --> 01:38:57,739
Okay, close this room up. Don't block it

943
01:38:58,619 --> 01:39:12,170
I don't want anyone coming out. I need a gun. So somebody's saying laser on bodies

944
01:39:13,399 --> 01:39:14,359
Oh

945
01:39:14,359 --> 01:39:22,600
Does that destroy them?

946
01:39:22,600 --> 01:39:24,600
Okay turns into little meat chunks

947
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:36,149
That's very helpful

948
01:39:36,149 --> 01:39:39,670
What happened? What happened? What happened? What's going on? What's the spell that's happening?

949
01:39:48,329 --> 01:39:51,130
I'm overheating the gun. I'm overheating the gun. I'm overheating the gun

950
01:39:52,010 --> 01:39:53,609
Stop it. Relax

951
01:39:53,609 --> 01:40:05,619
This is gonna be a really easy cleanup though. Once these are all turned into like meat nuggets

952
01:40:12,470 --> 01:40:21,670
All right, cool

953
01:40:21,670 --> 01:40:23,670
That is a bigger mess

954
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:26,550
But no, it's not it's fine

955
01:40:26,550 --> 01:40:28,550
It'll be easier to clean up. Trust me

956
01:40:29,109 --> 01:40:44,680
Just cook the whole room

957
01:40:44,680 --> 01:40:50,630
Okay, now this room's ready

958
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:59,460
I can't I gotta

959
01:40:59,460 --> 01:41:01,460
Okay, we're good. Give me a bucket

960
01:41:01,460 --> 01:41:09,420
I'm i'm cleaning my feet

961
01:41:09,420 --> 01:41:14,600
What do you mean stop what i'm trying to just torch the whole room so I can uh

962
01:41:15,319 --> 01:41:20,300
Not if we're just coming here and just go like this on the ground and the ceiling and everything would be good

963
01:41:21,020 --> 01:41:31,189
And look at this. This is easy with these chunks

964
01:41:34,220 --> 01:41:36,220
Take a bubble bath on stream

965
01:41:37,899 --> 01:41:39,500
Uh, no

966
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:40,859
Sorry

967
01:41:40,859 --> 01:41:43,539
All right. I need a incinerator cube

968
01:41:43,859 --> 01:41:54,100
I didn't knock it over

969
01:41:54,100 --> 01:41:56,100
I knocked that over but that doesn't count

970
01:42:00,869 --> 01:42:02,899
See this would probably hold it all

971
01:42:02,899 --> 01:42:04,899
That's why I just torched the whole room

972
01:42:06,170 --> 01:42:09,050
Because now I can probably fit 90% of these in the cube

973
01:42:09,770 --> 01:42:12,460
And then just have to worry about this one cube

974
01:42:19,640 --> 01:42:22,119
You want to take a bubble bath with clothes on i've done that before

975
01:42:24,329 --> 01:42:26,569
It burnt my skin, so i'm not doing it again

976
01:42:32,020 --> 01:42:42,310
Watch out don't knock it over

977
01:42:42,310 --> 01:42:50,199
Okay, i'm gonna need quite a few more of these but now at least i'm not gonna step on this

978
01:42:52,899 --> 01:42:56,220
I this I love this game

979
01:42:56,220 --> 01:42:58,220
So you wouldn't recommend taking a bubble bath with clothes on

980
01:42:59,100 --> 01:43:08,949
No, probably not it's too hot

981
01:43:21,100 --> 01:43:24,460
One last staple

982
01:43:24,460 --> 01:43:26,460
Okay, what's this do?

983
01:43:31,449 --> 01:43:41,979
I don't know what that did

984
01:43:41,979 --> 01:43:47,640
I just yeah what I don't get what that is. I need a new bucket. I need two or three buckets actually

985
01:43:51,180 --> 01:43:53,109
Where's the bath video?

986
01:43:53,109 --> 01:43:55,430
Uh tf2 crates video. Yeah, i'm in the bath

987
01:43:58,380 --> 01:44:05,340
That's the one right?

988
01:44:05,340 --> 01:44:07,829
Does every room have a lever?

989
01:44:07,829 --> 01:44:12,390
Be careful here. I don't want to fuck this up. Is there a lever here? Okay. Is this gonna okay?

990
01:44:12,949 --> 01:44:28,500
Hold on does this open the tubes and do the aliens come up this turns on the saw

991
01:45:00,329 --> 01:45:04,789
That doesn't do anything. I can't touch the saw

992
01:45:20,090 --> 01:45:28,310
Well, okay, it's just for fun. Well, that was fun. You can have the saw spin around

993
01:45:30,600 --> 01:45:33,000
This is some dense dense dirt

994
01:45:33,640 --> 01:45:36,420
I'm gonna take a little bit of chunk

995
01:45:37,380 --> 01:45:39,770
Get it in there

996
01:45:39,770 --> 01:45:41,770
You know, you know, i'm gonna get the chunks first

997
01:45:42,010 --> 01:45:45,979
I know i'm stepping all over the place, but I have to get rid of all this bullshit first

998
01:45:46,779 --> 01:45:56,359
Keep an eye out for chunks

999
01:45:56,359 --> 01:45:59,800
You made those scorch marks, by the way. Yeah, I know but I also made the chunks

1000
01:46:00,659 --> 01:46:02,659
I would not be able to fit this dude in here

1001
01:46:02,979 --> 01:46:06,649
I mean his leg's a little unruly but we can fix that

1002
01:46:07,770 --> 01:46:37,350
Yep. All right

1003
01:46:37,350 --> 01:46:38,710
Oh

1004
01:46:38,710 --> 01:46:57,739
God damn it that hurt. I thought I was gonna be able to get it over there. That sucked turn off the stream

1005
01:46:58,300 --> 01:47:10,460
I'm gonna get the uh

1006
01:47:10,460 --> 01:47:24,020
Okay. All right. I fucked it up. No, I didn't i'm fine. I'm good

1007
01:47:28,300 --> 01:47:30,300
This is a dirty floor

1008
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:36,659
How did it get so dirty?

1009
01:47:36,659 --> 01:47:39,460
Fuck I screwed it up. Now you can say I fucked it up because I did

1010
01:47:47,270 --> 01:47:50,710
What's the purpose? Where am I?

1011
01:47:50,710 --> 01:47:53,270
uh

1012
01:47:53,270 --> 01:47:55,909
The purpose is there was an fps video game that was played here

1013
01:47:57,050 --> 01:48:02,569
And you have to clean up after it because nobody ever thinks about what happens after you leave a level

1014
01:48:05,939 --> 01:48:07,939
Pretty fun concept for a game funny

1015
01:48:08,739 --> 01:48:14,090
interesting

1016
01:48:14,090 --> 01:48:16,710
Why am I getting minus two?

1017
01:48:16,710 --> 01:48:18,710
I just read you the back of the box

1018
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:23,880
That's like the description on the steam page

1019
01:48:26,739 --> 01:48:27,699
What?

1020
01:48:27,699 --> 01:48:33,340
I'm trying

1021
01:48:34,619 --> 01:48:37,979
Now now it's gonna happen again put it down it's gonna happen again

1022
01:48:46,250 --> 01:48:50,140
Is it really still happening? Who cares?

1023
01:48:50,859 --> 01:48:55,880
I need like seven of these

1024
01:48:55,880 --> 01:49:03,909
It's the bonus room

1025
01:49:03,909 --> 01:49:07,779
Where's that bucket giving me? I don't what if and I don't even care if I track

1026
01:49:08,659 --> 01:49:23,609
That's I just hit my mouth on the door. All right, I need like seven buckets and i'll be happy

1027
01:49:27,449 --> 01:49:29,449
One in each corner one right here

1028
01:49:29,689 --> 01:49:32,569
I'm gonna he's tracking. He's tracking. He's tracking. I know it's fine

1029
01:49:33,529 --> 01:49:42,090
I'll take care of it

1030
01:49:42,090 --> 01:49:46,090
I wanted to get the meat out of the way. I didn't want to pick that up. You understand

1031
01:49:51,270 --> 01:49:58,420
Get over here

1032
01:49:58,420 --> 01:50:01,460
Four buckets one in each corner and then one in the middle and i'll be good to go

1033
01:50:02,260 --> 01:50:03,140
one

1034
01:50:03,140 --> 01:50:04,260
two

1035
01:50:04,260 --> 01:50:08,039
This is what rock bottom looks like

1036
01:50:33,689 --> 01:50:35,689
He's gonna hiss at us

1037
01:50:36,010 --> 01:50:47,159
Now that's four we're good

1038
01:50:47,159 --> 01:50:49,159
Derma is basically adam sandler

1039
01:50:49,880 --> 01:50:59,880
What are you talking about? Adam sandler. Yeah

1040
01:51:02,039 --> 01:51:05,399
Adam sandler. Yo, are you talking about the guy that was on saturday night life?

1041
01:51:08,279 --> 01:51:10,439
Made a bunch of funny movies back in the 90s

1042
01:51:12,420 --> 01:51:14,420
But just didn't know when to stop

1043
01:51:14,739 --> 01:51:18,069
You compare me with a guy that's won an emmy

1044
01:51:19,430 --> 01:51:33,270
Two emmies

1045
01:51:33,270 --> 01:51:37,100
Now we're good. Just a question of getting these tools off

1046
01:51:39,850 --> 01:51:41,850
Happy gilmore was an okay movie

1047
01:51:42,779 --> 01:51:45,579
Yeah, it was it was yes it was it was fine it was

1048
01:51:53,979 --> 01:51:56,859
What was wrong with happy gilmore? It was fun. It was funny

1049
01:51:57,979 --> 01:52:00,600
I mean maybe it was like a little

1050
01:52:00,760 --> 01:52:19,800
Shitty but a little don't drop it pick it up pick up

1051
01:52:20,970 --> 01:52:26,420
Why are you so large get in there? See we're we're almost done with this room

1052
01:52:27,140 --> 01:52:31,770
It won't be long won't be like it'll be like another two hours tops

1053
01:52:32,329 --> 01:52:35,460
This is getting full give it a jiggle

1054
01:52:36,100 --> 01:52:41,640
It's all right. I'll just i'm gonna take this take it out now

1055
01:52:49,819 --> 01:52:53,659
I know i'm tracking. I know I know I know I just saw it in the chat. I get it

1056
01:52:55,779 --> 01:52:59,859
I get it

1057
01:52:59,859 --> 01:53:01,859
Wash the entry no

1058
01:53:02,439 --> 01:53:04,520
Wash the entry i'm not going to

1059
01:53:10,939 --> 01:53:13,100
All that down there. Oh, there's so much

1060
01:53:15,909 --> 01:53:17,909
There's so much left

1061
01:53:18,069 --> 01:53:21,850
All right, just stick with the plan

1062
01:53:21,850 --> 01:53:26,550
wrong room

1063
01:53:26,550 --> 01:53:28,630
Fucking piece of shit streamer

1064
01:53:30,010 --> 01:53:32,010
Hey relax, man

1065
01:53:35,020 --> 01:53:37,819
Whoa

1066
01:53:37,819 --> 01:53:39,500
Oh my god

1067
01:53:39,500 --> 01:53:53,609
I just need to get it out of the way

1068
01:53:53,609 --> 01:54:03,380
Where's my incinerator? What is this?

1069
01:54:04,180 --> 01:54:07,699
It's fucking gold

1070
01:54:07,699 --> 01:54:37,210
Can I sell this? I don't know what it is about these streams in particular

1071
01:54:37,289 --> 01:54:42,970
But I just I just love I don't know why i'm having so much fun doing stupid shit that everybody hates

1072
01:54:43,800 --> 01:54:47,880
It's it's like a weird thing with these streams. I don't know why I do it when I play this game

1073
01:54:52,340 --> 01:54:59,220
When am I getting bt tv never i'm making a volcano

1074
01:55:02,579 --> 01:55:05,899
Uh, yeah, I just did that i'll take the credit for

1075
01:55:13,100 --> 01:55:17,109
All right looking good looking good

1076
01:55:17,109 --> 01:55:19,739
Watch out for the super volcano

1077
01:55:19,739 --> 01:55:21,739
There's no super volcano

1078
01:55:36,409 --> 01:55:41,050
No, okay. There is this okay. There's a little baby volcano that sits underneath

1079
01:55:43,939 --> 01:55:49,060
Scientists are predicting that it could blow any minute, but they're talking about the scale of the universe

1080
01:55:49,060 --> 01:55:51,220
So any minute for the scale of the universe

1081
01:55:52,409 --> 01:55:56,569
You know, we've only been here humans have only been around for like 600 years, right?

1082
01:55:57,529 --> 01:55:59,539
so

1083
01:55:59,539 --> 01:56:02,579
I mean you're talking about like potentially the million years before that blows

1084
01:56:03,460 --> 01:56:26,789
I mean a bucket

1085
01:56:26,789 --> 01:56:38,039
I gotta get rid of this thing

1086
01:56:38,039 --> 01:56:41,560
I know I fucked up the volcano, but I need the box. I need the box

1087
01:56:50,949 --> 01:56:54,229
I hope new viewers are coming in and hearing this. I know I don't know what i'm doing

1088
01:56:55,109 --> 01:57:00,010
If that's the first thing you hear you're probably just like, whoa

1089
01:57:01,609 --> 01:57:09,449
All right. See you

1090
01:57:09,449 --> 01:57:22,340
I need

1091
01:57:22,340 --> 01:57:24,340
Getting there getting there getting there almost done

1092
01:57:31,590 --> 01:57:34,149
But all right, i'm gonna be completely real no jogging around

1093
01:57:34,949 --> 01:57:37,350
If there is a giant super volcano under the earth

1094
01:57:37,909 --> 01:57:41,319
Whatever

1095
01:57:41,319 --> 01:57:42,789
You know

1096
01:57:42,789 --> 01:57:45,239
What are we gonna do about it?

1097
01:57:45,239 --> 01:57:50,439
What's what are we gonna do?

1098
01:57:50,439 --> 01:57:55,420
live your life

1099
01:57:55,420 --> 01:57:56,779
Try your best

1100
01:57:56,779 --> 01:58:04,710
Look, I don't want I look here's the problem, right?

1101
01:58:05,350 --> 01:58:08,550
You never want like it to be a situation where it's like well that thing could explode

1102
01:58:08,789 --> 01:58:11,590
So let's go down and send a nuclear bomb into it

1103
01:58:12,310 --> 01:58:14,329
No, no, no, no, don't do that

1104
01:58:14,329 --> 01:58:18,970
Maybe if we dig down and put a giant drill and let out the air pressure. No, don't do that either

1105
01:58:19,770 --> 01:58:33,029
Be careful

1106
01:58:33,029 --> 01:58:40,100
What is this because nobody knows what it actually is

1107
01:58:40,659 --> 01:58:42,659
What if they go down there and it's a giant monster?

1108
01:58:43,510 --> 01:58:46,310
And the monster finally just is like, all right. Well now you woke me up

1109
01:58:46,869 --> 01:58:51,850
You know that movie godzilla. You ain't seen nothing

1110
01:58:52,409 --> 01:59:07,449
Don't knock it over. Okay, just trash

1111
01:59:10,920 --> 01:59:12,920
Why is the monster up to date with pop culture?

1112
01:59:14,119 --> 01:59:27,560
What the hell else are you gonna do down there?

1113
01:59:27,560 --> 01:59:30,039
Not much you can do when you're surrounded by fire

1114
01:59:32,310 --> 01:59:36,020
And you're locked in the center of the earth

1115
01:59:36,020 --> 01:59:38,020
You you're probably gonna watch friends

1116
01:59:39,060 --> 01:59:57,579
Every season 10 times you've had thousands of years to do it. I did that. Yeah, and look you're talking about

1117
01:59:57,659 --> 02:00:02,380
Oh like how what would he be doing down there? Are you serious? You're not even a monster and you did that

1118
02:00:02,939 --> 02:00:08,890
How many times have you loaded the full metal alchemist brotherhood season two intro?

1119
02:00:09,689 --> 02:00:13,130
And listened to it, you know how many times he's fucking done that

1120
02:00:26,390 --> 02:00:31,430
Let's get the rest of this shit. I gotta bring another box down here. This is a big box level. I would say

1121
02:00:32,149 --> 02:00:35,800
I need like four of these down here

1122
02:00:36,039 --> 02:00:44,970
I don't know how I got to this germa stream, but I guess i'm gonna stay on this germa stream. Well, hey, welcome

1123
02:00:45,609 --> 02:00:48,550
Thanks for sticking around

1124
02:00:48,550 --> 02:00:51,350
Yeah, we like we do this thing here we talk about like like topics

1125
02:00:54,359 --> 02:00:56,359
Like what if kind of what are scenarios?

1126
02:00:56,920 --> 02:00:59,770
But what if godzilla was real, you know, I mean, that's what that's in

1127
02:01:00,970 --> 02:01:20,279
Cheater console. I just I accidentally hit the till day

1128
02:01:21,399 --> 02:01:25,430
What do you want from me?

1129
02:01:25,430 --> 02:01:28,630
I'm gonna report this stream for trolling if you don't make a good joke soon

1130
02:01:29,350 --> 02:01:33,239
You can't what do you mean report me for trolling?

1131
02:01:39,340 --> 02:01:41,579
Who am I trolling you me?

1132
02:01:42,220 --> 02:01:44,220
Am I trolling myself? I don't understand

1133
02:01:44,619 --> 02:01:54,649
You said there's gonna I when have I ever said that there's gonna be a good joke incoming

1134
02:01:56,810 --> 02:01:59,220
I've never done that

1135
02:01:59,220 --> 02:02:01,220
There are no expectations here

1136
02:02:01,689 --> 02:02:12,010
Leave them at the door

1137
02:02:12,010 --> 02:02:17,539
Do the siren joke again. I probably will like three more times. Don't worry

1138
02:02:18,420 --> 02:02:21,060
If you hang out here long enough, you'll see that like probably five more times

1139
02:02:28,569 --> 02:02:31,369
Okay, I need two buckets

1140
02:02:36,119 --> 02:02:37,159
Oh

1141
02:02:37,159 --> 02:02:48,470
I just tony hawked it. I've given myself landmines in every corner. That's not a good idea

1142
02:02:49,109 --> 02:03:09,510
Uh, do I need this thing? Probably not knife get it in there

1143
02:03:10,310 --> 02:03:13,260
Blood on the ceiling. I'll get it. Don't worry

1144
02:03:13,420 --> 02:03:26,039
I'll take care of it. I just realized something. This is a huge soundtrack

1145
02:03:27,300 --> 02:03:29,300
How long is this soundtrack?

1146
02:03:33,239 --> 02:03:34,979
Seems pretty long

1147
02:03:34,979 --> 02:03:37,739
Wait, this thing has wheels. Can I

1148
02:03:41,189 --> 02:03:43,909
Caught it. Yep reflexes like a goddamn

1149
02:03:47,909 --> 02:04:09,220
cat

1150
02:04:09,220 --> 02:04:11,720
Unfunny spill joke

1151
02:04:11,800 --> 02:04:15,029
Oh

1152
02:04:15,029 --> 02:04:20,060
When did this soundtrack come up? This is 94

1153
02:04:21,020 --> 02:04:22,300
93

1154
02:04:22,300 --> 02:04:30,979
94 right? Yep. That's pretty damn good

1155
02:04:33,399 --> 02:04:43,500
They should do another one. No, and i'm not i'm not talking about donkey kong country 7-eleven fucking icy freeze

1156
02:04:44,060 --> 02:04:46,460
I'm talking about a donkey kong country game

1157
02:04:47,180 --> 02:05:05,350
Shitting so much over here. Did they do one for the switch?

1158
02:05:10,659 --> 02:05:13,539
Tropical freeze was composed by the same guy. Oh

1159
02:05:16,489 --> 02:05:18,170
whoops

1160
02:05:18,170 --> 02:05:19,369
Sorry about that

1161
02:05:19,369 --> 02:05:26,550
This hurts my eyes

1162
02:05:26,550 --> 02:05:31,850
Is this can this show?

1163
02:05:31,850 --> 02:05:40,310
Maybe that's a good thing to have was a tropical freeze a good game

1164
02:05:40,949 --> 02:05:44,699
I think I actually bought that a long time ago

1165
02:05:48,279 --> 02:05:52,119
It's great

1166
02:05:52,119 --> 02:05:54,810
It's very hard. But yes

1167
02:05:58,359 --> 02:06:00,359
All right, if nintendo is smart

1168
02:06:01,300 --> 02:06:02,659
Don't you think?

1169
02:06:02,659 --> 02:06:06,140
Because let's face it

1170
02:06:06,140 --> 02:06:08,140
Like 42 people bought the wii u

1171
02:06:08,859 --> 02:06:12,060
Don't you think they should just bring some of those games over?

1172
02:06:12,619 --> 02:06:20,300
What's this thing? I'm just checking to see if it

1173
02:06:20,939 --> 02:06:23,260
Was worth keeping

1174
02:06:23,260 --> 02:06:26,020
They have been

1175
02:06:26,020 --> 02:06:27,859
That was a perfect throw

1176
02:06:27,859 --> 02:06:29,859
I couldn't have tried to do that

1177
02:06:29,859 --> 02:06:37,720
I hope you understand

1178
02:06:37,720 --> 02:06:52,359
Tropical freeze is on the switch. That's kind of cool nintendo was smart than starfox would

1179
02:06:54,250 --> 02:06:56,729
Yeah

1180
02:06:56,729 --> 02:06:59,850
They probably tried to make a couple of didn't they try to make one a few years ago?

1181
02:07:01,079 --> 02:07:01,880
and

1182
02:07:01,880 --> 02:07:06,119
The wii u was really hitting the bottom of its life cycle and they maybe just were like nah

1183
02:07:06,840 --> 02:07:20,100
Probably not worth it

1184
02:07:20,100 --> 02:07:22,409
Why did the wii u fail?

1185
02:07:22,569 --> 02:07:24,279
because

1186
02:07:24,279 --> 02:07:25,800
They named it

1187
02:07:25,800 --> 02:07:29,159
The same thing as the other console with a u in front of it

1188
02:07:30,500 --> 02:07:33,460
And they had a giant game gear for a controller

1189
02:07:46,840 --> 02:07:48,840
It was a clunky mess

1190
02:07:49,260 --> 02:07:51,260
Maybe with some decent titles on it

1191
02:07:54,250 --> 02:07:58,569
But the switch has the joycons and then oh get the pro controller you would you would have a box

1192
02:07:59,369 --> 02:08:01,529
Of controller peripherals for that system

1193
02:08:02,170 --> 02:08:06,949
Because holding on to that giant brick ipad game gear thing was no way

1194
02:08:07,029 --> 02:08:09,909
Could you do that for more than like an hour or two it hurt?

1195
02:08:10,710 --> 02:08:22,010
The switch is the wii u with detachable confronted. Yeah, but it's also more comfortable

1196
02:08:24,069 --> 02:08:28,069
The wii u pad was thick it was thick

1197
02:08:28,789 --> 02:08:43,510
And chunky

1198
02:08:43,510 --> 02:08:47,909
Like the wii u was pretty damn chunky. I wouldn't be surprised if it was a murder weapon at some point

1199
02:08:49,270 --> 02:08:51,270
That thing weighed like four pounds

1200
02:08:58,100 --> 02:09:11,619
Get rid of this. All right, this one's pretty much done and the news outlets would have got it all wrong

1201
02:09:12,420 --> 02:09:14,100
it would have been like

1202
02:09:14,100 --> 02:09:18,340
local man smashes a brick into a friend's face

1203
02:09:19,289 --> 02:09:33,909
They don't have to fax, you know, that's a way that was a wii u this one's done. I just got a couple more little pieces

1204
02:09:34,630 --> 02:09:41,739
out

1205
02:09:41,739 --> 02:09:43,739
Why do you know so much about this?

1206
02:09:44,060 --> 02:09:46,060
covering my own crimes

1207
02:09:46,840 --> 02:09:52,039
No, sorry guys. I didn't like I didn't like wii u brick pad somebody in the face

1208
02:09:53,500 --> 02:09:55,979
Good thing that wasn't a bucket. It can't be spilled

1209
02:10:03,140 --> 02:10:05,140
German behind you

1210
02:10:06,779 --> 02:10:14,710
What the heck okay

1211
02:10:16,199 --> 02:10:18,600
No, that can stay

1212
02:10:18,600 --> 02:10:21,800
Any more pieces I need to pick up besides this

1213
02:10:22,359 --> 02:10:24,680
I'm just gonna let's try to spin it out of here ready

1214
02:10:25,720 --> 02:10:32,630
Ready for a paw camp

1215
02:10:32,630 --> 02:10:37,590
Oh imagine if it had bounced up there bounced into the incinerator. That would have been a clip of the week

1216
02:10:39,859 --> 02:10:41,859
Ceiling what's wrong with the ceiling?

1217
02:10:41,859 --> 02:10:57,579
It's pretty sleek. Just got to move some stuff around

1218
02:10:59,060 --> 02:11:00,579
Some over here

1219
02:11:00,579 --> 02:11:07,239
It's still red

1220
02:11:07,239 --> 02:11:08,920
Oh that was close

1221
02:11:08,920 --> 02:11:30,300
Don't forget about the bullet holes

1222
02:11:30,949 --> 02:11:32,069
I will

1223
02:11:32,069 --> 02:11:38,520
I'm just gonna be frank with you. I definitely I absolutely will forget about that until the very end of this level

1224
02:11:40,359 --> 02:11:43,479
And the chat is just gonna be spamming with lul

1225
02:11:44,939 --> 02:11:49,779
idiot

1226
02:11:49,779 --> 02:11:56,699
You're gonna see it fail fishes. Yeah, that'll happen too

1227
02:12:02,630 --> 02:12:04,229
Corner here

1228
02:12:04,229 --> 02:12:12,680
Close this up

1229
02:12:12,680 --> 02:12:22,119
Mm-hmm. This room looks pretty done all around the alien

1230
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:27,449
Containers looks good

1231
02:12:27,449 --> 02:12:29,670
I think we're good

1232
02:12:29,670 --> 02:12:40,600
Looks good

1233
02:12:40,600 --> 02:12:43,079
Ceiling. Yeah, that was a little bit on there wasn't it a little bit

1234
02:12:43,880 --> 02:12:50,920
This up just to have it dust

1235
02:12:54,180 --> 02:12:57,880
Okay, let's move on

1236
02:12:58,039 --> 02:13:00,779
I need a med kit

1237
02:13:00,779 --> 02:13:03,989
Is that what this shit is for?

1238
02:13:03,989 --> 02:13:06,300
first aid supplies

1239
02:13:06,300 --> 02:13:07,579
Let me see it

1240
02:13:07,579 --> 02:13:22,100
Do I have to actually put this fucking thing in?

1241
02:13:28,470 --> 02:13:33,670
Damn, okay

1242
02:13:33,670 --> 02:13:35,670
Just put it I did I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it

1243
02:13:36,890 --> 02:13:39,800
So what is this stuff for?

02:13:39,800 --> 02:13:43,640
Solar flare wet floor sign pizza slicer toilet seat lantern

1245
02:13:44,119 --> 02:13:46,039
What are these for?

1246
02:13:46,039 --> 02:13:50,090
This is gonna be bright

1247
02:13:50,090 --> 02:14:05,899
How bright is this? How do I turn it on put it in the fire?

1248
02:14:07,430 --> 02:14:10,600
Okay

1249
02:14:10,600 --> 02:14:12,680
Oh cool. Okay. Well, I need it back

1250
02:14:16,439 --> 02:14:19,880
Well, all right. Well, at least I know what it does who cares what what's the point of that?

1251
02:14:20,600 --> 02:14:44,220
All right. That's I mean, that's cool. I guess

1252
02:14:46,359 --> 02:14:49,399
Make 20 of them. No, I don't want to melt everybody's eyes

1253
02:14:49,880 --> 02:14:51,880
I just want to see what it looked like. All right

1254
02:14:52,489 --> 02:14:53,529
Let's go

1255
02:14:53,529 --> 02:14:55,420
This room's done

1256
02:14:55,420 --> 02:14:58,699
Close it up just I i'm I gotta close the rooms that are done

1257
02:14:59,500 --> 02:15:04,810
Because I will forget now walk around in circles. I'll come back in and chop. I'll double check it

1258
02:15:06,170 --> 02:15:11,859
For now, we're gonna seal it up

1259
02:15:11,920 --> 02:15:16,850
handprint this hand

1260
02:15:17,909 --> 02:15:21,590
How did you even see that I don't know how you even saw that shit

1261
02:15:33,189 --> 02:15:35,189
We got two hours and 15 minutes

1262
02:15:37,689 --> 02:15:45,590
Maybe like another 10 minutes. I got so many buckets. So we go

1263
02:15:46,649 --> 02:15:48,649
That's the way up. I'm almost done

1264
02:15:49,800 --> 02:15:51,800
I'll get a rhythm watch the rhythm

1265
02:16:02,039 --> 02:16:04,199
I'm gonna make a Hansel and Gretel trail

1266
02:16:05,100 --> 02:16:11,289
Of buckets. Oh, yeah. Wait, I forgot about this room. I was supposed to do this one first

1267
02:16:12,090 --> 02:16:44,920
Haven't even been to the basement or the second floor yet. I'll be all right. Does it wait as a basement?

1268
02:16:52,819 --> 02:16:56,420
That's fine. I'm gonna and i'll be the first person ever on stream to beat this level

1269
02:16:56,979 --> 02:16:59,129
I'm okay having that

1270
02:16:59,129 --> 02:17:07,930
Like look at how many buckets I got it's gonna take no time at all. Once we set it all up

1271
02:17:11,940 --> 02:17:15,059
Fix the bullet holes. I'm gonna don't worry. I'll get it all

1272
02:17:17,239 --> 02:17:23,270
I will get it all this is off right? Yeah, just need a couple more incinerators

1273
02:17:23,829 --> 02:17:28,809
I'm not tracking

1274
02:17:28,809 --> 02:18:06,739
I'm gonna stack them four should be enough. Can I do this? I could probably do more. No, I got it

1275
02:18:07,139 --> 02:18:08,500
Everything's fine

1276
02:18:08,500 --> 02:18:19,819
Put these around the room. Don't fucking watch the bus. There's so many landmines around me

1277
02:18:21,110 --> 02:18:23,110
All right, move this down here

1278
02:18:24,780 --> 02:18:27,590
Don't step on a landmine

1279
02:18:27,590 --> 02:18:29,430
You come this way

1280
02:18:29,430 --> 02:18:31,139
down here

1281
02:18:31,139 --> 02:18:33,670
right in the middle

1282
02:18:33,670 --> 02:18:45,239
Look at all this junk. I think we're in a decent spot to start picking up the chunks

1283
02:18:46,280 --> 02:18:48,280
This can probably go over here. Yeah

1284
02:18:51,860 --> 02:18:53,049
Okay

1285
02:18:53,049 --> 02:18:57,500
corner to corner

1286
02:18:57,500 --> 02:18:59,979
Uh, we got a whipped cream canister

1287
02:19:00,700 --> 02:19:02,700

1291
02:19:20,600 --> 02:19:21,639
I didn't touch it

1292
02:19:21,639 --> 02:19:29,989
But thank you so much comfort eagle if you stack the buckets inside each other you can carry more than one

1293
02:19:30,549 --> 02:19:32,549
To and from your work area

1294
02:19:34,520 --> 02:19:36,520
Yeah, I don't know if i'm gonna be able to handle that

1295
02:19:42,120 --> 02:19:43,559
Make a pile

1296
02:19:43,559 --> 02:19:45,319
Thank you comfort eagle

1297
02:19:45,319 --> 02:19:47,370

Cut up the bodies with the pizza slicer

1299
02:19:51,770 --> 02:19:56,440

02:20:30,700 --> 02:20:37,030
Can I do it in the bucket?

1307
02:20:37,030 --> 02:20:42,379
All right. I got it. I turned him into a blood-borne enemy

1308
02:20:43,989 --> 02:20:45,989
All right with those can fit

1309
02:20:59,860 --> 02:21:14,620
No, no, no, no

1310
02:21:14,620 --> 02:21:20,420
All right

1311
02:21:20,420 --> 02:21:22,420
Now let's chunk it up

1312
02:21:35,290 --> 02:21:37,530
Somebody said you have at least three more hours here

1313
02:21:38,090 --> 02:21:44,649
This is well, this is dr. Phil and you uh, are having a problem at sea

1314
02:21:45,129 --> 02:21:48,329
I'll take the fucking plus five for that one

1315
02:21:48,569 --> 02:22:16,950
It's 500

1316
02:22:16,950 --> 02:22:21,819
Shit, i'm usually good at timing that

1317
02:22:21,819 --> 02:22:24,139
It doesn't fix the bolt holes. I'm gonna do that at the very end

1318
02:22:24,940 --> 02:22:26,379
Because then I can

1319
02:22:26,379 --> 02:22:29,739
Just go look at them all and want to track dirt everywhere and all that shit. I'll get them

1320
02:22:30,219 --> 02:22:36,659
Because I need to use the gun for that

1321
02:22:36,659 --> 02:22:40,020
Put on a dr. Phil ost put on a dr. Phil episode

1322
02:22:43,940 --> 02:22:44,899
No

1323
02:22:44,899 --> 02:22:46,899
I'm not gonna put on dr. Phil

1324
02:22:51,899 --> 02:22:53,899
Dr. Phil doesn't have an ost

1325
02:23:07,209 --> 02:23:17,670
He does

1326
02:23:17,670 --> 02:23:19,670
This is his theme song

1327
02:23:33,899 --> 02:23:36,379
It's when yeah, no this is when he comes out. Yeah, okay

1328
02:23:37,420 --> 02:23:39,420
The audience is clapping

1329
02:23:39,420 --> 02:23:41,420
He walks out sits down in his big chair

1330
02:23:47,059 --> 02:23:57,690
Okay, so, uh, what's next on the autoplay? I don't know looks like dr. Phil theme music hd

1331
02:24:07,770 --> 02:24:10,329
What's the difference how is how is this one high quality

1332
02:24:11,370 --> 02:24:20,020
It's the same song

1333
02:24:20,020 --> 02:24:22,500
Does he have an outro or is the intro the outro?

1334
02:24:26,389 --> 02:24:34,940
It's probably one of those scenarios

1335
02:24:34,940 --> 02:24:37,239
Are you certain?

1336
02:24:37,239 --> 02:24:39,399
Are we sure this is not like sonic tennis?

1337
02:24:41,340 --> 02:25:07,020
Choose your character screen. That's what it sounds like. Oh my god. I gotta move this shit out of the way this

1338
02:25:07,979 --> 02:25:09,239

02:25:09,239 --> 02:25:11,239
Bile puke all over the walls

1340
02:25:18,920 --> 02:25:20,920
Dr. Phil in the chat

02:25:21,299 --> 02:25:22,579
Are you serious?

1342
02:25:22,579 --> 02:25:27,510
What's up, man?

1343
02:25:27,510 --> 02:25:31,110
Oh dr. Dr. Phil raid here comes a dr. Phil raid

1344
02:25:32,360 --> 02:25:35,319
Six and a half million people just showed up. Oh, hey, whoa

1345
02:25:36,040 --> 02:25:45,700
Hey, thanks for the raid man. See you at twitchcon

1346
02:25:46,420 --> 02:25:51,989
This is not like a 10-hour version of the song is it?

1347
02:25:52,549 --> 02:25:56,809
This song is gonna make me lose my fucking mind

1348
02:26:03,420 --> 02:26:05,819
I don't check

1349
02:26:05,819 --> 02:26:07,819
I have to check. I think that's it

1350
02:26:08,379 --> 02:26:14,040
Yeah, that's it. Here comes another one. This is a different theme song though somehow

1351
02:26:14,120 --> 02:26:16,520
This is I don't know how to see this has a theme song

1352
02:26:17,159 --> 02:26:23,209
This is the wheel of fortune ost

1353
02:26:32,280 --> 02:26:38,149
I like this one. Yeah, I do. This is good. I have some dirty buckets

1354
02:26:47,690 --> 02:26:50,409
This fits too. This is pretty good selection. Who picked this?

1355
02:26:52,549 --> 02:26:54,549
YouTube's auto algorithm bot

1356
02:27:02,149 --> 02:27:06,700
Hey, I see it twitchcon

1357
02:27:06,700 --> 02:27:08,700
Twitchcon I didn't go to twitchcon

1358
02:27:15,370 --> 02:27:16,729
save

1359
02:27:16,729 --> 02:27:18,010
Good idea

1360
02:27:18,010 --> 02:27:25,030
Am I already?

1361
02:27:25,030 --> 02:27:27,030
122 14

1362
02:27:27,049 --> 02:27:29,690
Did I only save one time in the middle of santa's workshop?

1363
02:27:33,020 --> 02:27:39,180
I would go to twitchcon if uh vanna whiten. Yeah, if if if the cast of and the crew

1364
02:27:40,579 --> 02:27:43,459
Of wheel of fortune went to twitchcon and they had like a panel I would go

1365
02:27:47,450 --> 02:27:49,770
And let me try the stacking thing that that person was talking about

1366
02:27:50,329 --> 02:27:52,329
This is the dirty. He's gotta go

1367
02:28:06,969 --> 02:28:11,379
Raid a wheel of fortune raid incoming god. I would love to go on one of those shows

1368
02:28:12,260 --> 02:28:14,899
And just blotch the absolute hell out of everything

1369
02:28:15,860 --> 02:28:17,860
Spin the wheel the wrong way every time

1370
02:28:18,739 --> 02:28:22,020
No, no, no jeremy stop doing that you're spinning the wheel the wrong way

1371
02:28:22,819 --> 02:28:31,479
I'm sorry. Sorry

1372
02:28:31,479 --> 02:28:33,799
Uh any vowels?

1373
02:28:33,799 --> 02:28:36,200
Uh, you have to ask me for a letter

1374
02:28:37,530 --> 02:28:40,010
Oh, uh d

1375
02:28:40,010 --> 02:28:44,569
D is not a vowel god. Damn it now. I'm gonna get him to scream like a swear on the air

1376
02:28:45,209 --> 02:29:04,600
And like end his career

1377
02:29:04,600 --> 02:29:07,639
Why would this come up next? I don't know why this would come up next

1378
02:29:08,520 --> 02:29:10,520
But apparently we're gonna see this

1379
02:29:10,680 --> 02:29:14,649
This is not connected to

1380
02:29:20,219 --> 02:29:25,209
Is this gonna be tv we're gonna go from here

1381
02:29:25,850 --> 02:29:29,049
I buy I bet you I bet you graze anatomy is next

1382
02:29:30,170 --> 02:29:33,459
on the autoplay

1383
02:29:33,459 --> 02:29:46,139
I wonder

1384
02:29:46,139 --> 02:29:49,690
Oh

1385
02:29:49,690 --> 02:29:57,879
All right

1386
02:30:00,180 --> 02:30:16,120
Holy shit it works

1387
02:30:16,120 --> 02:30:19,559
No, this one's fine. All right. Is it graze anatomy?

1388
02:30:22,149 --> 02:30:24,149
Well, I think this is extended

1389
02:30:31,850 --> 02:30:35,579
No, it's not graze anatomy. It's something else

1390
02:30:36,459 --> 02:30:50,059
Yeah

1391
02:30:50,059 --> 02:30:51,739
This is a different version

1392
02:30:51,739 --> 02:30:58,819
I think this one might be hd. Yeah

1393
02:30:59,379 --> 02:31:01,819
It sounds like an hd version

1394
02:31:01,899 --> 02:31:15,459
This thought is going to get nuked

1395
02:31:18,069 --> 02:31:23,909
Yeah, oh god the screams the sound of saws and machinery the roaring and restless groans from the cells is too much also wrong

1396
02:31:24,469 --> 02:31:39,579
It's so dirty back here

1397
02:31:46,299 --> 02:31:51,799
I gotta get rid of all of them

1398
02:31:51,799 --> 02:31:53,799
Can we get something else besides the breaking bad theme?

1399
02:31:54,120 --> 02:31:58,200
And then after whatever the next one is I gotta turn it up before I get like before I get deleted

1400
02:31:59,079 --> 02:32:19,299
I'm i'm gonna get deleted on the air. This is gonna be stream offline for about 35 seconds

1401
02:32:19,940 --> 02:32:27,370
All right new buckets. Let's go new buckets new new

1402
02:32:28,170 --> 02:32:30,659
Don't spill it

1403
02:32:30,899 --> 02:32:39,879
Don't be a coward

1404
02:32:39,879 --> 02:32:42,040
Well, I want people to be able to watch the vods

1405
02:32:46,760 --> 02:32:49,510
Okay, we'll get one more

1406
02:32:53,590 --> 02:32:55,590
Holy shit

1407
02:32:56,889 --> 02:32:58,889
Oh

1408
02:33:05,559 --> 02:33:12,389
I've never even seen this show. I'll clean this up later. I've never seen this show. Is this a good show?

1409
02:33:18,760 --> 02:33:22,649
Mega spill

1410
02:33:22,649 --> 02:33:27,379
This one's very low. It's not that audible. It's modern family

1411
02:33:29,819 --> 02:33:31,819
Thankfully, it's only 30 seconds long

1412
02:33:44,229 --> 02:33:50,329
Um, what are these shows that i've never heard of mom cbs tv series?

1413
02:33:52,680 --> 02:34:01,590
This is a six minute video. How could you have an intro for your show? That's six fucking minutes long

1414
02:34:08,889 --> 02:34:13,399
What have I done over here?

1415
02:34:13,399 --> 02:34:14,440
Uh

1416
02:34:14,440 --> 02:34:20,329
Yeah, I have to next this no i'm not gonna sit here and listen to this

1417
02:34:23,659 --> 02:34:25,579
I'm nexting it

1418
02:34:25,579 --> 02:34:28,219
By the way, this is I believe this is the song

1419
02:34:28,860 --> 02:34:32,299
This is an orchestra version of the song that we're just hearing

1420
02:34:36,899 --> 02:34:40,739
This is the mom song but it's an orchestra doing the actual song

1421
02:34:44,950 --> 02:34:46,950
All right next again

1422
02:34:49,020 --> 02:34:53,590
Okay, this is

1423
02:34:53,590 --> 02:34:56,549
This is the same. This is the same song, I think

1424
02:35:04,340 --> 02:35:06,340
No, let's do it again

1425
02:35:13,989 --> 02:35:26,250
What is it is this no, wait a minute, oh this is star wars i'm gonna get out of there

1426
02:35:27,290 --> 02:35:29,290
Wait here

1427
02:35:30,649 --> 02:35:32,649
No, don't wake up

1428
02:35:36,569 --> 02:35:52,250
Get off

1429
02:35:52,250 --> 02:35:55,690
I I almost just turned off the stream for the joke. I almost just turned my fucking stream off

1430
02:36:00,139 --> 02:36:03,100
But I want I don't want to do that. It's been like two and a half hours. I want to keep playing

1431
02:36:05,579 --> 02:36:07,579
I can't just like delete the stream

1432
02:36:07,659 --> 02:36:14,020
That would have been worth it

1433
02:36:14,020 --> 02:36:15,139
maybe

1434
02:36:15,139 --> 02:36:18,520
Not after two and a half hours if it okay if it had been like seven hours

1435
02:36:19,079 --> 02:36:27,530
I may have done it still early. Come on. All right, let's uh clean this up

1436
02:36:36,360 --> 02:36:41,639
No, no osts. I want I want to be able to have a non muted vod for five minutes

1437
02:36:53,020 --> 02:36:56,979
parks and rec

1438
02:36:56,979 --> 02:37:01,620
Nah

1439
02:37:01,620 --> 02:37:04,340
My vods never get muted. Well, I don't really play music

1440
02:37:07,129 --> 02:37:10,090
I very rarely play music usually when we're just hanging out

1441
02:37:11,180 --> 02:37:14,459
Just being dickheads in a game like this is when I play music on the stream

1442
02:37:15,260 --> 02:37:23,059
Put on binaural beats

1443
02:37:24,979 --> 02:37:27,459
No, i'm not gonna like mind control everybody in here

1444
02:37:43,889 --> 02:37:45,190
binaural beats

1445
02:37:45,190 --> 02:37:47,190
Doesn't that the shit that just goes like

1446
02:37:50,389 --> 02:38:03,799
No, no, we got to play the play the low one too. Yeah it goes like

1447
02:38:05,239 --> 02:38:18,729
Get off, you know what binaural beats sounds like

1448
02:38:19,370 --> 02:38:28,020
Uh, you know when you have your cell phone sitting near a computer and your phone is about to ring and you get that

1449
02:38:30,440 --> 02:38:39,750
Well, my phone's gonna ring

1450
02:38:39,750 --> 02:38:43,350
That can't be healthy, right?

1451
02:38:43,350 --> 02:38:48,309
The fact that we can hear that when your phone is near a speaker or a computer or something. That can't be good

1452
02:39:04,280 --> 02:39:06,280
El fatso crisps

1453
02:39:07,129 --> 02:39:08,569
It's interference

1454
02:39:08,569 --> 02:39:15,909
I mean it is

1455
02:39:15,909 --> 02:39:21,750
Uh, i'm most certainly pleased with the progress we've made in recent months the dna harvested from the captured alien creatures

1456
02:39:21,750 --> 02:39:28,870
Has allowed our creation truly blossom into a vessel of unprecedented strength and malice with further treatments. I'm certain

1457
02:39:29,510 --> 02:39:32,309
We can realign the creature's mental capacity as we need

1458
02:39:32,790 --> 02:39:36,870
And on a final note who is responsible for the continued theft of my gloomberry doughnuts

1459
02:39:37,590 --> 02:39:40,090
How do you fast forward a stream?

1460
02:39:40,170 --> 02:39:43,690
Uh, there's a button down there. It's uh, it's play

1461
02:39:44,819 --> 02:39:49,219
Fast forward and then next and if you press the fast forward button

1462
02:39:50,899 --> 02:39:54,219
You uh, you can get it to work

1463
02:39:54,700 --> 02:39:57,180
But everybody has to collectively press it at the same time

1464
02:39:58,340 --> 02:40:03,670
And if you don't that it's not going to work

1465
02:40:03,670 --> 02:40:06,469
so I mean it needs to be at least five to

1466
02:40:08,260 --> 02:40:10,899
Like 500 to 2000 people have to all do it at the same time

1467
02:40:58,469 --> 02:41:14,420
So if you uh

1468
02:41:14,420 --> 02:41:18,579
Yeah, I mean i've never been that's the first time i was ever naked. So

1469
02:41:19,850 --> 02:41:22,459
It's hard to be naked

1470
02:41:22,459 --> 02:41:26,459
When you're naked, you know, if people can just see you they can see who you fucking really are

1471
02:41:26,940 --> 02:41:31,959
So that's why I don't do it anymore. But uh, thanks for the four thousand dollars. Uh, appreciate it

1472
02:41:34,069 --> 02:41:37,030
Somebody that you know, over the course of the last four hours or so. Thank you

1473
02:41:50,629 --> 02:41:54,309
And I fucked it all up again, didn't I?

1474
02:42:11,459 --> 02:42:13,459
I you guys seriously have

1475
02:42:19,159 --> 02:42:22,760
No, you know, don't rewind me. Don't do it. Don't i've been sitting here for so long

1476
02:42:23,079 --> 02:42:27,719
It's been four hours. No, you're gonna delete the four thousand dollars that the guy just gave me. Don't do it

1477
02:42:28,600 --> 02:42:30,600
No, I want that four grand

1478
02:42:30,680 --> 02:42:32,280
Don't bring me back

1479
02:42:32,280 --> 02:42:34,280
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't do it. Don't do it

1480
02:42:36,200 --> 02:42:38,200
Stop get your finger off that button

1481
02:42:39,180 --> 02:42:41,350
No

1482
02:42:41,350 --> 02:42:42,969
Oh

1483
02:42:42,969 --> 02:42:46,010
It's pulling me in three different directions. I'm going across dimensions

1484
02:42:47,899 --> 02:42:49,899
Fucking buy neurobeats

1485
02:42:52,229 --> 02:42:54,090
Don't do it

1486
02:42:54,090 --> 02:42:55,909
No

1487
02:42:55,909 --> 02:43:05,690
No

1488
02:43:08,340 --> 02:43:11,860
No, don't let me you're killing me you're killing me

1489
02:43:37,620 --> 02:43:43,190
Don't do it

1490
02:44:01,670 --> 02:44:06,790
Blood coming out of my eyes I can fight it for another minute or two. I could fight the whole thing

1491
02:44:10,969 --> 02:44:14,229
It's blood coming out of my mouth

1492
02:45:00,260 --> 02:45:10,659
So I think this box here I can um, I can use this right fill up the pieces and bring it down

1493
02:45:10,899 --> 02:45:15,799
How long do you think it's gonna take me to do this? I would say probably

1494
02:45:16,360 --> 02:45:21,020
Was it two and a half hours? Well, no, okay. Nothing in there

1495
02:45:22,790 --> 02:45:31,670
Fuck this is gonna take so long. Is it what's this? Is there an upstairs?

1496
02:45:32,409 --> 02:45:54,229
There's not an upstairs. No fucking way. Well, whatever. Uh, can I open the doors? I don't think I can this one

1497
02:45:54,870 --> 02:46:03,290
This one looks already clean. I don't get it. Where do the buckets come from?

1498
02:46:10,739 --> 02:46:17,450
This feels kind of weird. All right music. Uh

1499
02:46:18,329 --> 02:46:25,879
Zero the volume's all the way down from the last stream, right? That's not okay. Well what we got

1500
02:46:32,280 --> 02:46:38,899
Um, that's that that that I don't like that one. That's the same

1501
02:46:39,780 --> 02:46:43,350
That's the same one

1502
02:46:43,350 --> 02:46:50,709
Dude, I don't like either one of these

1503
02:46:50,709 --> 02:46:53,979
No

1504
02:46:53,979 --> 02:46:57,620
Um, I don't think so

1505
02:46:57,620 --> 02:47:03,180
Doom os i'm not gonna play doom ost. We're not doing the ost thing. I want to hit the actual end game music

1506
02:47:05,129 --> 02:47:06,729
No, no

1507
02:47:06,729 --> 02:47:08,729
No, no, no

1508
02:47:09,780 --> 02:47:11,780
No, no, no, no

1509
02:47:12,100 --> 02:47:13,559
No

1510
02:47:13,559 --> 02:47:21,430
There we go. So where should I start?

1511
02:47:24,120 --> 02:47:29,319
Fuck so what's like the dynamite thing here? Is it dynamite gonna come out of there?

1512
02:47:30,040 --> 02:47:32,040
What's like the funny thing for this one?

1513
02:47:33,290 --> 02:47:38,229
This room is clean

1514
02:47:38,229 --> 02:47:40,229
My fucking game is bugged. I think somehow

1515
02:47:42,020 --> 02:47:56,329
And this must be dirt in here

1516
02:47:56,329 --> 02:48:03,059
And uh other strange thing that i'm kind of noticing at the moment. Why am I covered in blood me in real life?

1517
02:48:06,329 --> 02:48:08,489
I blinked a couple times and I just i'm seeing red

1518
02:48:11,260 --> 02:48:13,260
this is uh

1519
02:48:13,579 --> 02:48:16,620
Maybe I was doing like a funny. Hey, look i'm in the game joke or something

1520
02:48:16,620 --> 02:48:18,700
Did the web did I turn the webcam on did I

1521
02:48:19,500 --> 02:48:23,059
What fucking time is it?

1522
02:48:23,059 --> 02:48:40,229
Did you see a doctor about that? Did you see a doctor about it? Should I what doctor are you referring to?

1523
02:48:40,709 --> 02:48:42,709
Talking about the good doctor phil

1524
02:48:48,090 --> 02:48:51,209
What even is what is this sound what is this fucking song

1525
02:48:54,059 --> 02:48:58,139
What an awful fucking sound this what is this? Uh, what is this like fucking sonic tennis?

1526
02:49:15,579 --> 02:49:18,139
Dr phil's rating

1527
02:49:18,219 --> 02:49:21,579
Oh, hey, dr phil. See you at twitchcon man. I'll high five you

1528
02:49:27,059 --> 02:49:30,340
That's so funny. What's next on the auto play? What the fuck is this?

1529
02:49:31,620 --> 02:49:34,440
Are you shitting me?

1530
02:49:34,840 --> 02:49:36,840
the hd

1531
02:49:44,200 --> 02:49:56,760
That one's even louder somehow. All right, let's continue cleaning. That's this fun game

1532
02:49:57,399 --> 02:50:12,409
Oh, what's the dna? Oops. This room is almost done. I can I pick this up move this over here

1533
02:50:15,340 --> 02:50:19,139
ha

1534
02:50:19,139 --> 02:50:21,510
Fill it up. Hey

1535
02:50:21,510 --> 02:50:34,069
Dr phil it up. I want to get rid of this. I never what's the point of this?

1536
02:50:38,090 --> 02:50:40,569
Bring him further back. I don't know what you mean by that

1537
02:50:40,969 --> 02:51:01,530
I can taste his blood

1538
02:51:01,530 --> 02:51:03,530
All right, speaking of blood. I gotta go pee

1539
02:51:09,049 --> 02:51:14,549
Fuck all right. I'll be back. I'm gonna grab another drink get some water and take a piss. I'll be right back

1540
02:55:04,659 --> 02:55:06,659
Hey he's back

1541
02:55:07,459 --> 02:55:17,959
That's enough of that thought I just turned on the camera that would have been bad

1542
02:55:23,100 --> 02:55:27,450
Is this the joke of the month

1543
02:55:27,450 --> 02:55:30,409
Well, it is it is it's barely january so

1544
02:55:32,620 --> 02:55:44,950
And it hadn't even been one full week. Let me open this back up and let's keep going. Let me uh,

1545
02:55:46,340 --> 02:55:49,879
Let me fix all the shit that I just ruined in the game. What's going on?

1546
02:55:50,889 --> 02:55:54,020
Oh, right. Okay

1547
02:55:55,370 --> 02:56:00,090
Uh, I kind of ruined everything so just added like a 45 minute plus timer

1548
02:56:01,319 --> 02:56:09,450
to the

1549
02:56:09,450 --> 02:56:11,290
Get him to the 23rd

1550
02:56:11,290 --> 02:56:13,290
Quick get him to the 23rd

1551
02:56:15,370 --> 02:56:16,969
you know part of that is

1552
02:56:16,969 --> 02:56:19,690
Really really really morbid of some of you guys

1553
02:56:20,870 --> 02:56:22,870
Skip to the 23rd

1554
02:56:23,370 --> 02:56:25,139
Why?

1555
02:56:25,139 --> 02:56:27,459
Because that's when you're supposed to die

1556
02:56:29,159 --> 02:56:31,860
Okay

1557
02:56:31,860 --> 02:56:33,459
My goodness

1558
02:56:33,459 --> 02:56:46,709
That's gonna be the worst stream of the year. I hope you guys understand that and I there's no

1559
02:56:47,510 --> 02:56:50,549
Oh, I wonder what he's gonna do

1560
02:56:50,549 --> 02:56:52,950
You I told you what i'm gonna do

1561
02:56:52,950 --> 02:56:54,229
That's the stream

1562
02:56:54,229 --> 02:56:58,389
I'm sitting in the room in a fucking goalie outfit

1563
02:56:59,270 --> 02:57:01,270
And just i'm just gonna survive

1564
02:57:05,059 --> 02:57:15,110
is it

1565
02:57:15,110 --> 02:57:16,709
What room was I in?

1566
02:57:16,709 --> 02:57:20,219
What am I talking about?

1567
02:57:20,219 --> 02:57:27,180
Like almost a year ago. I played a game. It was a game about like having illnesses and you could play as yourself

1568
02:57:28,940 --> 02:57:32,459
And I named the character me and the game told me that I was gonna die

1569
02:57:33,100 --> 02:57:35,100
on January 23rd 2019

1570
02:57:37,540 --> 02:57:38,659
so

1571
02:57:38,659 --> 02:57:47,829
That's coming up. So i'm gonna final destination my room

1572
02:57:48,469 --> 02:57:53,780
I'm gonna be drinking out of sippy cups

1573
02:57:53,940 --> 02:57:56,379
I'm gonna be covered in pads

1574
02:57:56,459 --> 02:58:09,500
Am I gonna go back to kenshi?

1575
02:58:09,500 --> 02:58:11,500
uh probably

1576
02:58:11,579 --> 02:58:13,659
Probably this weekend

1577
02:58:13,659 --> 02:58:15,659
Because the plan was we're gonna do this tonight

1578
02:58:16,379 --> 02:58:19,209
Because I love this game

1579
02:58:19,209 --> 02:58:22,250
And then after tonight tomorrow either get back to kenshi

1580
02:58:23,290 --> 02:58:25,290
for simpson's hit and run

1581
02:58:25,450 --> 02:58:27,540
That's the plan

1582
02:58:27,540 --> 02:58:31,459
Either one of them will work because whatever one doesn't happen the other one will happen the next day

1583
02:58:31,940 --> 02:58:38,870
so it depends

1584
02:58:38,870 --> 02:58:41,590
the reason why the simpson's hit and run was not tonight

1585
02:58:42,840 --> 02:58:44,840
is very very specifically because

1586
02:58:45,479 --> 02:58:48,040
I have it for playstation for playstation 2

1587
02:58:49,770 --> 02:58:50,969
I've

1588
02:58:50,969 --> 02:58:53,290
Can I like say a word with an f?

1589
02:58:54,969 --> 02:58:56,729
I have it for

1590
02:58:56,729 --> 02:58:58,940
ps2

1591
02:58:58,940 --> 02:59:00,059
and

1592
02:59:00,059 --> 02:59:03,260
I was told that it actually exists for pc

1593
02:59:03,899 --> 02:59:05,899
And there are mods

1594
02:59:05,899 --> 02:59:10,870
And the game is way better on pc. So I don't know how the hell i'm gonna work that out

1595
02:59:13,989 --> 02:59:16,469
But that's why I didn't do it tonight because I was gonna play it on ps2

1596
02:59:17,459 --> 02:59:19,459
And it turns out that probably shouldn't do that

1597
02:59:20,920 --> 02:59:23,959
If for some reason I can't get the pc version with the mods to work

1598
02:59:24,600 --> 02:59:32,700
Then i'm just gonna do the playstation 2 version. That's the plan

1599
02:59:33,799 --> 02:59:37,639
I need another I need to get with the program here. Give me some buckets

1600
02:59:39,370 --> 02:59:41,370
And then 700,000 games part two. Yes

1601
02:59:43,319 --> 02:59:50,620
In probably in that order i'll probably wait for uh next week to do 700,000 games, too

1602
02:59:53,909 --> 02:59:56,739
Give me a break

1603
02:59:56,739 --> 02:59:58,100
Rng

1604
02:59:58,100 --> 03:00:04,620
Rng

1605
03:00:04,620 --> 03:00:06,860
Okay, just make all right. That was pretty cool

1606
03:00:10,309 --> 03:00:12,469
Yeah, there is a 700,000 games part two

1607
03:00:13,270 --> 03:00:15,959
The company made another one

1608
03:00:15,959 --> 03:00:18,200
And we need to see what it is

1609
03:00:18,200 --> 03:00:20,200
So that's gonna be a whole stream

1610
03:00:21,719 --> 03:00:23,930
I just kick flipped

1611
03:00:23,930 --> 03:00:25,370
Yes, I did

1612
03:00:25,370 --> 03:00:29,100
Do these fit in here?

1613
03:00:29,100 --> 03:00:32,459
No, i'm gonna have to stack these and walk them just stack them up and walk them

1614
03:00:33,020 --> 03:00:39,610
What's the best way to stack these?

1615
03:00:39,610 --> 03:00:44,579
like this

1616
03:00:44,579 --> 03:00:45,860
but this

1617
03:00:45,860 --> 03:00:53,989
Fuck actually that's a better way to do it. I think

1618
03:01:15,799 --> 03:01:18,440
I could play this game and be in a meeting

1619
03:01:18,840 --> 03:01:27,930
I wonder how many lawyers own this game and they're on the phone with a client just doing this

1620
03:01:28,489 --> 03:01:38,280
I'm doing these all upside down, huh?

1621
03:01:38,280 --> 03:01:54,280
An idiot fucking idiot idiot that this one i'm see if I can even do this

1622
03:02:02,889 --> 03:02:10,950
Somehow magically they haven't fallen

1623
03:02:10,950 --> 03:02:38,139
Whoa

1624
03:02:38,139 --> 03:02:44,120
Yeah, hold all my calls. I got a meeting. I got something else important going on

1625
03:02:44,600 --> 03:02:51,020
Can this even fit in here? I can barely fit the fucking printer in here

1626
03:02:51,340 --> 03:03:06,299
Okay, close it up. Well, i'm gonna have to put these in. Oh my I I didn't even spill and I picked it up

1627
03:03:07,879 --> 03:03:25,219
I picked it up. It didn't spill. I picked it up. It's a lot of work. I got a lot of meetings to miss

1628
03:03:25,379 --> 03:04:10,920
Okay, we're good. Hold on to the box. Fuck it. Just don't let me forget about these. All right

1629
03:04:11,799 --> 03:04:13,209
Okay

1630
03:04:13,209 --> 03:04:14,010
fun

1631
03:04:14,010 --> 03:04:28,309
Persona 5 ost. No, i'm not gonna no no persona 5 i'm gonna play that game if if anything

1632
03:04:28,629 --> 03:04:47,930
All right, I got a full bucket here. Now i'm gonna play it on stream mine sweeper ost

1633
03:04:51,379 --> 03:04:56,680
All right. I'm not gonna say the word ost for another year. Okay

1634
03:05:07,819 --> 03:05:19,129
We're gonna hold you do that. Do it do it so many more rooms

1635
03:05:21,180 --> 03:05:31,079
Uh 24 hour stream apparently confirmed because this is how the fuck am I gonna do this do it

1636
03:05:37,579 --> 03:05:42,600
24. All right. So those of you that are internet connoisseurs

1637
03:05:44,120 --> 03:05:47,000
There are there are 4,300 people watching this stream right now

1638
03:05:48,940 --> 03:05:51,909
Another doctor fucking phil how

1639
03:05:52,709 --> 03:05:54,709
What would the view count be?

1640
03:05:55,350 --> 03:05:58,629
If I put on repeat the doctor phil theme song

1641
03:06:00,600 --> 03:06:02,940
For a full hour

1642
03:06:02,940 --> 03:06:04,940
What would the viewer count look like?

1643
03:06:05,260 --> 03:06:18,840
One hour from now. I would yeah, I would say somewhere around like 1.4 like 1400

1644
03:06:21,799 --> 03:06:22,680
and

1645
03:06:22,680 --> 03:06:24,440
follow-up question

1646
03:06:24,440 --> 03:06:26,440
Would any of those people come back?

1647
03:06:26,840 --> 03:06:28,120
that left

1648
03:06:28,120 --> 03:06:35,350
Ever again, I don't think so

1649
03:06:42,120 --> 03:06:44,120
Even some of you guys that are saying

1650
03:06:44,360 --> 03:06:46,840
Oh, yeah, no, that'd be so funny. Do it you'd leave

1651
03:06:47,639 --> 03:06:50,600
You'd be here for 20 minutes and then you'd go fuck man. That's something else

1652
03:06:50,600 --> 03:06:57,450
I could probably be doing right now. You'd leave too. I'd leave

1653
03:06:58,709 --> 03:07:02,069
And this is I have the stream turned on I would just get up and go

1654
03:07:02,790 --> 03:07:16,280
Like walk my dog

1655
03:07:16,280 --> 03:07:18,920
I would report the stream if you did that

1656
03:07:20,819 --> 03:07:27,219
What's the drop down menu and you report a stream? Oh, okay. We got a offensive. Uh bad. Uh, he's naked

1657
03:07:28,180 --> 03:07:31,700
He's playing doctor phil for 10 hours

1658
03:07:49,989 --> 03:07:51,989
If you want you can file reports

1659
03:07:52,309 --> 03:07:57,510
Describe how you think certain people were murdered if you put people's id tags in your chest you get extra cash

1660
03:08:00,520 --> 03:08:06,200
What?

1661
03:08:06,200 --> 03:08:16,569
That's so cool. Is that real?

1662
03:08:16,569 --> 03:08:18,729
All right, so we have successfully cleaned up

1663
03:08:19,530 --> 03:08:21,209
this area

1664
03:08:21,209 --> 03:08:23,610
The area that I caused a huge problem in

1665
03:08:24,409 --> 03:08:26,649
Nothing in here, right? Empty. Oh a couple of blitz

1666
03:08:27,450 --> 03:08:29,750
Just dump them out in here

1667
03:08:29,989 --> 03:08:34,940
That's stuck

1668
03:08:34,940 --> 03:08:45,659
Whatever I can get another one. When am I gonna go on the doctor phil show?

1669
03:08:47,690 --> 03:08:49,690
I'm not I don't have any plans to

1670
03:08:56,709 --> 03:08:59,209
How's this for him looking?

1671
03:09:00,170 --> 03:09:03,299
Not good

1672
03:09:08,709 --> 03:09:14,540
That's stuck in my head no what

1673
03:09:23,530 --> 03:09:25,530
He said he'd love to have you

1674
03:09:27,059 --> 03:09:32,170
What would we talk about? What's why do I have to go on the show? There has to be a reason

1675
03:09:46,329 --> 03:09:50,569
Jeremiah i'm done with you not listening play the portal 2 soundtrack

03:10:28,860 --> 03:10:30,459

1682
03:10:30,459 --> 03:10:44,489

Relax are you mocking us? Yes. Well, I can't mock you guys sometimes

1689
03:12:12,379 --> 03:12:18,399
You know, I look over in this chat and sometimes all I see is a mo ck ing

1690
03:12:19,299 --> 03:12:24,899
Sometimes that's the only thing I see

1691
03:12:24,899 --> 03:12:30,940
So if you can't take the heat and take a couple of cooking classes and maybe you'll get better

1692
03:12:31,180 --> 03:12:42,540
Hey, you know how many times I'm gonna have somebody have somebody doctor a fucking photo of me at five feet tall

So that's it. That's how you know

1697
03:13:34,120 --> 03:13:35,639
My voice drops

1698
03:13:35,639 --> 03:13:40,389
It's like this and it's like fucking I don't know what the fuck and I swear a shit every other sentence every other word

1699
03:13:50,120 --> 03:13:52,120

03:14:57,799 --> 03:14:59,799
It's getting so fucking irritating

03:15:00,459 --> 03:15:03,530
Fucking give me a break

1711
03:15:03,610 --> 03:15:05,610
Give me a fucking break

1712
03:15:13,129 --> 03:15:21,719

03:15:23,239 --> 03:15:39,819
What's he what's he so mad? No, i'm doing a pretend mad

1714
03:15:40,459 --> 03:15:43,260
When sometimes i've been actually mad that's how you can tell

1715
03:15:49,690 --> 03:15:56,250
What would possibly be causing me to be mad right now for these pretending in quotes. I'm like picking up thumb drives

1716
03:16:05,290 --> 03:16:07,930
What no i'm just kidding. You guys know i'm kidding

1717
03:16:09,659 --> 03:16:11,659
What the heck are you talking about?

1718
03:16:15,209 --> 03:16:18,409
Bad elvis impression. Oh now you got me

Be real for once in your life. What?

1721
03:16:40,469 --> 03:16:43,030
I wouldn't be real for once in your life

1722
03:16:43,750 --> 03:16:48,969
This guy hates his viewers. I don't that's not true

1723
03:16:50,120 --> 03:16:55,670
Don't say such incorrect things so this room is pretty much done

1724
03:17:00,899 --> 03:17:03,590
Yeah, okay

1725
03:17:05,270 --> 03:17:15,110
What's wrong is he talking about the broom

1726
03:17:15,750 --> 03:17:22,899
Do I have to throw the broom away?

1727
03:17:22,899 --> 03:17:26,180
Med kits med kit. What what are you? Oh, are you putting in the mad?

1728
03:17:27,079 --> 03:17:33,180
No, if you clicked on this and you didn't have any context funny it fucking the first five times, which is seriously

1729
03:17:33,739 --> 03:17:35,979
It's getting so fucking irritating

Fucking give me a break

1731
03:17:39,719 --> 03:17:41,719

1733
03:17:54,200 --> 03:18:14,840
And who says i'm not a good actor this text to speech in the game. Oh, yeah forgot about that

1734
03:18:20,409 --> 03:18:24,170
You're gonna fight it dog. I'm not even gonna read that out loud. All right, i'm gonna pay attention

1735
03:18:24,729 --> 03:18:28,040
I'm gonna pay attention for another mouth down comes up

1736
03:18:42,139 --> 03:18:44,139
I was looking over at chat

1737
03:18:47,180 --> 03:18:53,129
Oops

1738
03:18:53,129 --> 03:18:57,129
Ah, and it's everywhere now, come on. It's this dump room

1739
03:18:58,639 --> 03:19:03,780
Unfun it's not a spill joke. It's me looking at the chat. I fucking see fucking fucking dumb fucking game

03:19:14,500 --> 03:19:18,819
He spilled the thing. Yeah, I know and I know you're giving me the I know what that means now

1741
03:19:19,540 --> 03:19:21,700
I know what the forehead emote means now

1742
03:19:22,260 --> 03:19:25,139
I thought people thought it was hilarious some of the shit that I was doing. Nope

1743
03:19:26,790 --> 03:19:28,309
That's the kappa

1744
03:19:28,309 --> 03:19:30,540
of lul

1745
03:19:30,540 --> 03:19:31,739
I get it now

1746
03:19:31,739 --> 03:19:46,950
Okay, let's bring this

1747
03:19:46,950 --> 03:19:58,040
Okay, we're almost done

1748
03:19:58,040 --> 03:20:03,750
Come here. Come here. I have to like knock those around. Don't I crap? Oh crap

1749
03:20:04,549 --> 03:20:14,649
I can reach this one

1750
03:20:14,649 --> 03:20:20,569
Sounded out what do you mean sounded out sound out what everyone people used to do kappa

1751
03:20:21,860 --> 03:20:29,870
People still do it. I see it from time to time. I need some more incinerators

1752
03:20:35,219 --> 03:20:37,219
You didn't clean the outside of the building

1753
03:20:43,340 --> 03:20:45,340
Fuck you. No, no, no

1754
03:20:54,680 --> 03:20:59,639
No, that's not stop taking me out of context. This happened two days ago, too

1755
03:21:00,040 --> 03:21:18,620
All right, clean clean clean. We're almost ready to go to the next step. What the fuck are you doing, man?

1756
03:21:19,100 --> 03:21:25,299
There's body parts in here

1757
03:21:25,299 --> 03:21:51,639
He's losing it. I'm not losing it. I'm not losing it. He's losing it

1758
03:21:59,450 --> 03:22:01,450
This feels like a vr game. It is

1759
03:22:02,170 --> 03:22:07,850
You didn't know I was in vr. I'm doing very well for how goofy it is to hold these move controllers

1760
03:22:08,250 --> 03:22:48,020
I hate when they like that. I gotta get on top and knock them this way. Is it out? Shit get out from there

1761
03:22:48,340 --> 03:22:51,739
Can I can I pick you up over this way? I hope so

1762
03:22:57,879 --> 03:23:01,479
Ah, that felt good. That was like removing a rotten tooth

1763
03:23:09,659 --> 03:23:11,659
Play a more calming tranquil game

1764
03:23:12,360 --> 03:23:27,219
That this is kind of the epitome of a tranquil just calm game, isn't it? It's not gonna happen. I'm gonna

1765
03:23:29,110 --> 03:23:32,229
Bring it out here sit on the gurney

1766
03:23:34,600 --> 03:23:39,479
Bloods everywhere. It's totally calm. I mean, it's relaxing to just clean. I'm just relaxing

1767
03:23:41,620 --> 03:23:43,620
How much of the upstairs have you done?

1768
03:23:43,620 --> 03:23:45,799
Um

1769
03:23:46,040 --> 03:23:48,149
90 maybe

1770
03:23:48,149 --> 03:23:56,280
Something like that

1771
03:23:56,280 --> 03:23:58,280
Maybe 95 percent

1772
03:24:07,860 --> 03:24:09,940
If it's so tranquil, why are you losing your shit?

1773
03:24:10,659 --> 03:24:18,739
This is just what happens when I play vista or clean up detail. We just start talking about anything

1774
03:24:23,719 --> 03:24:25,719
And that's it. We just hang out

1775
03:24:25,799 --> 03:24:35,399
Have fun. All right, that looks good

1776
03:24:36,200 --> 03:24:38,200
Under the table under the table

1777
03:24:40,229 --> 03:24:43,190
There is a meat chunk that's sitting there

1778
03:24:46,899 --> 03:24:48,899
And where's my bar? There it is

1779
03:24:51,239 --> 03:24:53,239
missed two on the step

1780
03:24:54,280 --> 03:24:56,440
Missed step two there pal

1781
03:24:57,770 --> 03:24:59,049
What?

1782
03:24:59,049 --> 03:25:03,909
What's step two?

1783
03:25:06,700 --> 03:25:16,969
Pal, I don't know what you mean. What do you mean? Looks good

1784
03:25:18,729 --> 03:25:20,729
The ward almost done with the ward

1785
03:25:29,420 --> 03:25:32,569
Okay, I wish I could turn this is gonna give me

1786
03:25:33,530 --> 03:25:35,930
Anxiety, man. I gotta turn that over. I wish I could pick it up

1787
03:25:36,569 --> 03:25:45,799
Nothing on the ceiling

1788
03:25:45,799 --> 03:25:53,299
Okay, did it miss any other blood? I don't think it did looks good looks good looks good looks good

1789
03:25:59,540 --> 03:26:01,379
Yep, 30

1790
03:26:01,379 --> 03:26:03,559
Or is it reflection? I think it's a reflection

1791
03:26:07,799 --> 03:26:09,559
portal to ost

1792
03:26:09,559 --> 03:26:10,600
Ah

1793
03:26:10,600 --> 03:26:14,090
I just said it

1794
03:26:14,090 --> 03:26:25,399
Shit i'm supposed to not ever say that again. It's gonna set this down over here

1795
03:26:27,139 --> 03:26:29,139
I need some med kit go right there

1796
03:26:29,940 --> 03:26:42,709
gimme

1797
03:26:42,709 --> 03:26:48,200
Got it clean that up

1798
03:26:48,200 --> 03:26:50,600
You the incinerators right here might as well just drop it in

1799
03:26:52,729 --> 03:26:56,090
New year's resolution failed. I don't think so

1800
03:26:57,299 --> 03:27:00,739
What was my actual new year's resolution? You guys heard it. Wasn't it something different?

1801
03:27:00,899 --> 03:27:07,930
Something else

1802
03:27:07,930 --> 03:27:11,930
But then I say like two days ago

1803
03:27:11,930 --> 03:27:14,010
Oh installing a better twitch tv. Yeah, that's right

1804
03:27:15,700 --> 03:27:18,659
Yeah, as long as I just do that at some point during the year, then it's fine

1805
03:27:20,469 --> 03:27:22,069
I could do that on

1806
03:27:22,069 --> 03:27:23,250
december

1807
03:27:23,250 --> 03:27:32,549
29th 2019. I still did it. This one is done, right? Just want to make sure done

1808
03:27:33,739 --> 03:27:36,760
There's a bucket in here though

1809
03:27:36,760 --> 03:27:45,020
Let's just double check

1810
03:27:45,020 --> 03:27:47,020
You think we'll forget? No, it'll be fine

1811
03:27:47,659 --> 03:27:48,780
I'll get it

1812
03:27:48,780 --> 03:27:56,440
Derm has been live for four hours and this is not even halfway done

1813
03:27:59,479 --> 03:28:01,479
Well, we're going to have to finish it

1814
03:28:02,260 --> 03:28:04,260
Regardless of how long it takes

1815
03:28:05,559 --> 03:28:08,440
And how many things we do this game has nudity

1816
03:28:09,399 --> 03:28:12,440
That's not what you said. You said was this game made in unity?

1817
03:28:13,239 --> 03:28:15,239
I'm not sure where my mind went there

1818
03:28:22,780 --> 03:28:25,739
Clean clean clean. We only got the one little upstairs area

1819
03:28:26,299 --> 03:28:33,590
Clear out the downstairs

1820
03:28:33,590 --> 03:28:37,000
Press a couple of buttons

1821
03:28:37,000 --> 03:28:39,000
All right. Wait, let's I gotta go

1822
03:28:39,239 --> 03:28:43,020
Missed a spot we can triple check

1823
03:28:44,120 --> 03:28:46,520
I'll come back down here. We're gonna do all the good to go through with the

1824
03:28:47,479 --> 03:28:49,959
Ghost busters meter. We'll find whatever needs to be found

1825
03:28:51,500 --> 03:28:53,819
This on the other hand needs to be cleaned up bad

1826
03:28:55,399 --> 03:28:59,079
Uh, what are the empty ones? This one's kind of dirty stick it in there

1827
03:28:59,719 --> 03:29:02,790
Okay

1828
03:29:02,790 --> 03:29:04,629
Empty stick it in there

1829
03:29:04,629 --> 03:29:09,530
Okay

1830
03:29:09,530 --> 03:29:11,049
I need a med kit

1831
03:29:11,049 --> 03:29:17,799
Let's go one more pass to make sure I didn't miss anything

1832
03:29:18,780 --> 03:29:23,959
Might as well pull it out just to look

1833
03:29:23,959 --> 03:29:25,959
There ain't nothing here

1834
03:29:28,600 --> 03:29:30,739
Just spotless

1835
03:29:30,739 --> 03:29:31,879
Guaranteed

1836
03:29:31,879 --> 03:29:53,260
All right stack this up and let's get the hell out of here and move on

1837
03:29:53,979 --> 03:30:06,260
I don't like how this is

1838
03:30:06,260 --> 03:30:08,260
Tip it this way. What the fuck man

1839
03:30:08,579 --> 03:30:12,579
Tip it that I wanted to tip it the other way that didn't even tip over

1840
03:30:15,860 --> 03:30:20,979
I'm gonna be real with me that didn't even tip over. It was just barely. I was moving it around

1841
03:30:21,620 --> 03:30:37,459
They're all empty. Anyways, don't fucking matter. No. Hey, he very funny

1842
03:30:39,299 --> 03:30:43,219
I mean, I honestly was just trying to get it so I wasn't gonna tip over but

1843
03:30:44,500 --> 03:31:03,370
You know, oh what a silly what silly stuff. He's doing right now fresh buckets

1844
03:31:04,010 --> 03:31:08,969
This is new, but I don't want I'm wondering I gotta bring them over there

1845
03:31:12,649 --> 03:31:14,969
Okay, nice and clean get in there

1846
03:31:20,469 --> 03:31:26,389
All right. I'm about to play the portal to ost for the as long as it takes to get the fastest gnome in the world

1847
03:31:30,340 --> 03:31:51,559
You're gonna get like a whoo, but except it's the first song in portal to but here live it over here on the wall

1848
03:31:53,979 --> 03:31:55,979
But almost done

1849
03:31:55,979 --> 03:31:57,979
There's only about five minutes left

1850
03:32:00,760 --> 03:32:02,760
This looks good. I need a med kit

1851
03:32:09,000 --> 03:32:14,569
Done good. Goodbye. I need a health pack for that room

1852
03:32:14,649 --> 03:32:18,170
I'm gonna go through at the very end and make sure to change everything and fix everything

1853
03:32:18,809 --> 03:32:21,500
So don't worry

1854
03:32:21,500 --> 03:32:24,950
Moving on what do we got here?

1855
03:32:26,440 --> 03:32:28,540
This door cannot be opened

1856
03:32:28,540 --> 03:32:30,540
There's nothing even here. It's just for show

1857
03:32:31,780 --> 03:32:34,420
further down

1858
03:32:34,420 --> 03:32:39,059
Also, this door is locked nothing even in there. So that's good. I thought I had way more to do

1859
03:32:41,159 --> 03:32:43,159
I need some buckets

1860
03:32:43,799 --> 03:32:50,700
The gun is right here. All right, i'll do the bullet holes. Okay

1861
03:32:51,500 --> 03:33:15,260
How do you do them? I'm about to start a fire. Hold on there now everybody can exhale

1862
03:33:15,819 --> 03:33:40,120
What do you mean? We got him. Well, we got him. He's doing the thing. He's supposed to do

1863
03:33:40,520 --> 03:33:42,600
We'll do the rest later. I know there's more

1864
03:33:52,600 --> 03:33:54,040
All right, give me the bucket

1865
03:33:54,040 --> 03:34:02,040
How much real estate can I clear with just this little bucket that people need the portal to or we're gonna starve

1866
03:34:02,280 --> 03:34:06,120
What's that have to do with you eating food?

1867
03:34:14,379 --> 03:34:17,159
this

1868
03:34:17,159 --> 03:34:18,760
Not uh

1869
03:34:18,760 --> 03:34:22,360
Okay, not gonna do it yet. I want to clear this out and then get a few new buckets

1870
03:34:22,520 --> 03:34:25,000
I'm not gonna spill them. I'm gonna try as hard as I can to not

1871
03:34:25,639 --> 03:34:27,899
I promise

1872
03:34:27,899 --> 03:34:32,940
I'm not gonna spill it run too fast. I'm gonna walk with like four or five buckets

1873
03:34:33,659 --> 03:34:35,739
I'm gonna take it slow

1874
03:34:35,739 --> 03:34:39,879
Because this is now clean. I don't have to worry about this little corridor anymore. Good

1875
03:34:40,680 --> 03:35:05,510
It didn't even happen. Oh, hi. Yes. So funny

1876
03:35:06,149 --> 03:35:10,950
I'm sorry to the people that might be new to the stream that think that this is i'm doing this on purpose

1877
03:35:12,579 --> 03:35:17,959
It's not on purpose

1878
03:35:18,280 --> 03:35:20,040
Why give me

1879
03:35:20,040 --> 03:35:22,040

Knowing that wait what i'm gonna get in there. Don't do this. Did they all spill? No, okay

1882
03:36:09,850 --> 03:36:23,850

1883
03:36:23,850 --> 03:36:27,180
I'm holding shift. That's

1884
03:36:28,059 --> 03:36:31,420
That feels like it's gonna spill right? Is it? No, it's not. Okay

1885
03:36:44,620 --> 03:36:49,000
Whoa

1886
03:36:49,000 --> 03:36:59,129
Okay, put it down gently see I told you I was gonna try not have that be a thing

1887
03:37:25,270 --> 03:37:36,170
See, it's so bad. He wants to do it. Don't do it though

1888
03:37:49,100 --> 03:38:01,020
This should take me all the way up to the stairs. It should be good feels pretty good

1889
03:38:01,340 --> 03:38:32,489

Yep

1914
03:42:24,059 --> 03:42:26,520
Is this pre-recorded?

1915
03:42:26,520 --> 03:42:29,079
No

1916
03:42:29,079 --> 03:42:32,149

1919
03:42:36,340 --> 03:42:38,340
I'm at the beach right now. I forgot

1920
03:42:38,420 --> 03:42:40,819
I made sure to have a pre-recorded stream because i'm at the beach

1921
03:42:41,540 --> 03:42:47,500
I want to make sure I had something for today, you know

1926
03:43:52,139 --> 03:43:53,819
We can do the

1927
03:43:53,819 --> 03:43:55,340
Doppelohr

1928
03:43:55,340 --> 03:43:58,809
I'd love seeing the progress

1929
03:43:58,809 --> 03:44:00,569
This is where I started

1930
03:44:00,569 --> 03:44:03,450
There's the spawn. Look at how clean it is down here. There's no blood

1931
03:44:04,170 --> 03:44:16,819
Remember this shit how bad it looked

1932
03:44:16,819 --> 03:44:18,819
You get to really see your progress. It's great

1933
03:44:21,110 --> 03:44:22,790
At the limb box

1934
03:44:22,790 --> 03:44:25,430
I think I can just bring this over there now. Wait. Not yet. Not yet. Not yet

1935
03:44:32,649 --> 03:44:41,540
Good I gained 62 viewers from the dr. Phil music. That's incredibly specific

1936
03:44:49,659 --> 03:44:52,340
That's very okay. Here's the computer

1937
03:44:52,579 --> 03:44:54,579
I'm gonna put the thumb drives in there eventually

1938
03:44:55,959 --> 03:44:57,959
Maybe I should turn this into a thumb drive box

1939
03:44:58,920 --> 03:45:11,209
No, no, no, no dump it in here

1940
03:45:15,209 --> 03:45:17,049
That was just a dog

1941
03:45:17,049 --> 03:45:42,760
Running with his bone into the door. Fuck. I'm not sure I can put this in here. What the fuck are you doing? Open

1942
03:45:43,399 --> 03:45:48,969
Can I you can I close the lid on this thing?

1943
03:45:54,940 --> 03:45:58,299
Okay, I didn't know it had its own animation

1944
03:46:02,780 --> 03:46:04,780
It's gonna get a little sloppy over here. Anyways, don't worry

1945

2182
04:51:11,689 --> 04:51:26,619
gta vice city my favorite part about this whole stream so far has been when the music turns off

2183
04:51:27,580 --> 04:51:34,939
i look over at the chat room and it's just a million requests that's the best part

2184
04:51:40,919 --> 04:51:59,400
the room is silent hurry up scream we've done earthbound too many there's too many

2185
04:51:59,400 --> 04:52:24,389
requests here i don't know what to do i was supposed to do this a long time ago okay where

2652
06:53:53,299 --> 06:54:15,000

2653
06:54:19,580 --> 06:54:23,259
well this one has been stressful because i'm trying to get it done as fast as i

2654

2661
06:56:59,270 --> 06:57:13,669
in an hour 87 is demoted apparently so i think maybe because i did 99 last time

2662
06:57:13,669 --> 06:57:24,540
it's probably something like that that one was pretty cool and that's gonna be it

the eight hour mark i'm taking boomer vitamin supplements nah i'm not sick or anything i just

3071
08:02:58,919 --> 08:03:05,560
don't know something about i've had some like nasal issues recently just dry irritated kind of

3072
08:03:05,560 --> 08:03:11,909
nose and it might have something to do i have a humidifier so i'm not sure if it has to do

3073
08:03:11,909 --> 08:03:17,560
with the fact maybe it's just drying out here recently let's see vegas weather let's take a

3074
08:03:17,560 --> 08:03:24,069
look at the what do we got for humidity over there actually it's really fucking humid here

3075
08:03:24,790 --> 08:03:32,380
right now it's because it's apparently raining but last couple of days it's been really dry

3076
08:03:33,180 --> 08:03:47,099
so we'll see what the fuck are bits uh it's a fake twitch currency that translates into money

3077
08:03:47,099 --> 08:04:08,549
it's the best way to describe it v bucks yeah have a fantastic night catch you guys tomorrow

3078
08:04:08,549 --> 08:04:20,040
will you ever think of accepting direct donations uh yeah this this really here's how

3079
08:04:20,040 --> 08:04:40,150
that plays out right i think that is the t-shirt sales you know what i mean that to me is that

3080
08:04:40,150 --> 08:04:46,020
paypal chargebacks yeah there's a lot of weird issues that have never really been solved even

3081
08:04:46,020 --> 08:04:57,939
though a lot of people say that they've been solved how about ethereum now that's been

3082
08:04:57,939 --> 08:05:07,509
deleted from the bio as you see so i i don't like to take direct donations because

3083
08:05:08,619 --> 08:05:15,430
bits are through twitch subs are through twitch i don't have to really worry about

3084
08:05:15,430 --> 08:05:19,750
having to keep track of that and no oh wait a minute you have to wait that was disputed

3085
08:05:19,750 --> 08:05:23,430
yeah yo did you just did you use any of that money yeah well hold on a second here has been

3086
08:05:23,430 --> 08:05:36,020
disputed you gotta give it back you know he's gonna be careful so having a t-shirt sale is

3087
08:05:36,740 --> 08:05:43,369
very similar right i'd rather have something tangible something you can really hold on to

3088
08:05:43,930 --> 08:06:07,319
bits cost more though yeah i know i i know bits are more expensive than actual money it's

3089
08:06:07,319 --> 08:06:10,439
quite a bit cheaper on our end if you enable paypal as long as you're careful not to spend

3090
08:06:10,439 --> 08:06:16,810
everything right away chargeback shouldn't be a huge issue but also here's another thing for

3091
08:06:16,810 --> 08:06:26,659
tax purposes it's it's a lot easier for me to be able to have something from twitch that's a

3092
08:06:26,659 --> 08:06:37,509
tangible thing getting straight up monetary donations through paypal is i don't know it

3093
08:06:37,509 --> 08:06:45,860
always kind of freaks me out because then it's just a pot of money that for tax purposes looks

3094
08:06:45,860 --> 08:06:58,599
a lot looks kind of strange but i am sorry that bits are as the way that they are if i

3095
08:06:58,599 --> 08:07:05,099
could put like feedback into twitch partnerships you know it would be something like that the
