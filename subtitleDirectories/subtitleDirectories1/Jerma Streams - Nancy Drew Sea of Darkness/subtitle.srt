1
00:00:01,659 --> 00:00:32,310
Oh, shit. There we go. Hi. What's happening? How are the cheese toasties? They were

2
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:41,609
absolutely delicious. Before we get started today, with uh, you know, Drew Crew.

3
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:50,780
That's not even a phrase I coined. I saw that in chat yesterday. I was like, that's pretty good.

4
00:00:50,780 --> 00:01:01,909
Drew Crew. I like it. And to solve some mysteries. I've been told this one's actually good. Now,

5
00:01:01,909 --> 00:01:07,609
I don't know where that stands on the Nancy Drew tier list. Oh, fuck. I just gave it away. Well,

6
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:13,370
you can see, you can see the title. What do you, what else would be Drew Crew? Oh yeah. We're

7
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:21,340
doing Drew Crew. What else could that be? We, are we playing uh, Price is Right? What else could it

8
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:30,549
be? Uh, this apparently is a good one. I'm going to hold all judgment until we play it, you know.

9
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:50,040
50% of the stream's income should go to that guy. 50%. That's, that's not gonna happen. Anyways,

10
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,989
one thing before we go. Not go. I mean, like, go as in like step on the gas, not hit the brakes.

11
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:11,189
I have just opened a channel in the Discord. Two channels, actually. One of them doesn't work yet.

12
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:19,539
They are at the New Year's Eve, worst streams, worst of the year awards. We're gonna do that

13
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:26,389
again this year. The categories are up. If you want to see what you can possibly nominate,

14
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:36,099
the list of what they are are there. That channel is open for discussion. There's a separate,

15
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:42,379
just submit a nomination, which the rules aren't there yet. Uh, I kind of want to give like a day

16
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:49,340
or so or like just for people to discuss and collect some of the data. There's a category

17
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:54,300
on there that's not really a category, but it's something that I want to do. Um, if it's possible,

18
00:02:55,099 --> 00:03:02,539
I would like for whoever wants to embarrass me, go for it. Find all the times or specific times

19
00:03:02,539 --> 00:03:07,419
where I have told a lie. Because I'd like to see, I'd like to, you have to look in the mirror

20
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:11,819
sometimes. I want a full compilation of every time I've ever lied on this stream.

21
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:21,990
Just play a 15 straight minute video of every clip every time I've said something that was,

22
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:34,300
wasn't true. The video is going to be too long. Well, we can condense it. I'd like to try. 15

23
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:41,349
minutes. Yeah, you can shrink that down. You can shrink 150 hours down to 15 minutes. You just need

24
00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:50,469
like two words, three, one sentence. You know, like I will play ace attorney. That's not even

25
00:03:50,469 --> 00:03:55,449
two seconds. You think I've lied more than 150 times on this string. I don't think so.

26
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:13,900
He's probably lying right now. I said Drew crew first. Don't let this man's greed fool you.

27
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:22,870
Speaking of Drew crew. Yeah. Yes. We're, we're playing Nancy Drew in the sea of darkness.

28
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:33,860
I, this is what people want. It's just, this is what they want me to do. I, I was all right

29
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:41,300
with maybe just doing one, but I did buy like seven. This probably isn't even a Nancy Drew

30
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:48,019
stream. Well, what do you think this is? A screenshot? Here we go. Get ready for Nancy

31
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:57,430
Drew, a sea of darkness. I'm going amateur. Uh, can this be changed on the fly? Because the last

32
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:03,769
time I got really stuck, I just, I, it doesn't matter. I'll just cheat more challenging. No

33
00:05:03,769 --> 00:05:09,560
hints. Basic task list. Yeah. I'll just, it doesn't matter. I'll just look up the answer if I can't

34
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:33,110
get it. Uh, why are we all cheering? What, what is what happened? What just happened? Everyone was

35
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:48,459
like, yeah, here it comes. Oh, it's getting close. Uh, I got Ford. I got you contacting him through

36
00:05:48,459 --> 00:05:56,220
a friend of mine. I think you did some good sleuthing work with her in Scotland. Not too

37
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:01,579
long ago. First some background. Yours truly. You could officially call me a locator of fine goods

38
00:06:01,579 --> 00:06:06,939
per se. Can either condense this down. This is too much. This is too huge of a letter. Nobody can

39
00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:12,459
write this small and this legible. You guys ever tried to write a letter and not on lined paper,

40
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:21,449
by the way? Yeah. Right. Yeah. You can write like that. I actually do though. You cannot

41
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:29,689
write that perfect on paper. That's not lined paper. No way. No one writes letters anymore.

42
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:39,339
Yeah. They just write emails, but still I literally can. No, you can't go back for the boots.

43
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:44,459
Yeah. Anyways, here's some background on yours. Truly. Yeah. Yeah. I'm currently I'm in Iceland

44
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:52,620
in a small town called skip brought when I first arrived the, the here. Well, okay. I don't know.

45
00:06:53,990 --> 00:07:00,089
KO legacy just gave 10 community subs. Thank you. KO legacy. Appreciate that. Thanks for the 10 drop.

46
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:18,389
German just has bad handwriting. No, we haven't even started yet. I was about to go get paper

47
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:24,310
and show you. No, I can't. No, we have, I, what's the, okay. I helped to restore the ship. All right.

48
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:31,060
Who cares about any of this? Wait, long staying rumor about a treasure concealed somewhere.

49
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,790
You want to try? I'm going to try to do this. I'm going to try to do this letter.

50
00:07:35,750 --> 00:08:42,309
All right. I'll be right back. All right. Hold on. I got the camera on the tripod now.

51
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:49,080
Do I even have a pen in here? I'm supposed to be playing Nancy Drew. That's not what I'm doing.

52
00:08:49,080 --> 00:09:15,700
I think all my room is clean. I need a pen though. Maybe I got a pen and this is on

53
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:32,500
perfect computer paper, by the way. You got one? Open the Xbox. I just need this much room.

54
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:45,100
All right. I'm ready. Uh, computer paper right here. I just need to be able to see what I'm

55
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:53,080
looking at. Missed bits. Hold on. I'll get it. Okay. Okay. Now, um, I need a fucking pen. How

56
00:09:53,080 --> 00:10:48,860
do I have an office with no pens in it? We're fucking running around. Okay. I got it. Wait.

57
00:10:52,620 --> 00:11:09,110
You guys get it. I'm going to have to use the webcam mic. Is it plugged in? All right. Hold

58
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:28,710
on. I'm, I'm almost ready. Do it on an overhead projector. I don't, I don't have an overhead

59
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:44,600
projector. I have to get this right. You're a loser. What? Get my coffee out of the way.

60
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:53,940
All right. There's no bank statements here, right? I have to pick up the stack of computer

61
00:11:53,940 --> 00:12:10,620
paper and here's my bank statement. All right. Are we ready? Can you see it? Can you guys not see

62
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:44,139
this? Uh, it's not, uh, what is that? I can't even see. What is that? An image up? What the

63
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:53,429
fuck is this? What is this aiming at? Why is this so blown up? That's not the, no, it's not the

64
00:12:53,429 --> 00:13:04,059
chair leg. Oh, it's up there. Why is it up there? Why is my hand so big? Why do I have a monster

65
00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:23,990
hand? Why do I have such a big hand? Hey. Oh, look at those bones. Oh, what is that? Okay. My hand,

66
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:29,620
you know, you know, when you go to the Halloween store and you see like the look at the spooky hand

67
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:40,710
with real animatronics inside. That's what this is. Um, okay. Hold on. This has to be over here.

68
00:13:40,710 --> 00:14:15,139
Oh, I thought found the computer paper. Found it. What? Xbox is on. Okay. I can see it. Move this

69
00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:24,549
over here. Shrink it a little and then we got to turn it like this. No, I have to do this the way

70
00:14:24,549 --> 00:14:37,129
that I know it. I can't see what this says. Pale hands. There's no white balance on this camera.

71
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:57,320
Don't you understand? I don't have any fucking white balance on it. Can you see? Okay, good.

72
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:08,659
Let's go. Let me get myself a little reminder. Do laundry later. Okay. Good. I got your contact

73
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:17,750
with St. Nancy. I need fucking, I need writing music. Okay. Best music for writing.

74
00:15:18,549 --> 00:15:29,379
He's jacked. By the way, can we just talk about this fucking walnut desk? Immaculate.

75
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:39,750
Except for the couple places where I hit my hand with the VR controllers. Best music for writing.

76
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:51,370
Two hours of amazing writing and study playlist. What does that sound like? That sounds good.

77
00:15:54,759 --> 00:16:10,779
All right. Let me see if I can get this. I need to make this bigger. Thank dear. Okay. Nancy,

78
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:27,049
Nancy, I got your contact info. Get out of there. I'm going to try my hardest

79
00:16:33,139 --> 00:16:36,820
and don't make fun of the way that I hold a pencil. I know I got shit for this since I was

80
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:43,139
like the sixth grade. Okay. This is how I hold a pencil. I don't go like this. Oh, look at me.

81
00:16:43,299 --> 00:17:02,259
Hold a pencil like that. You got to put on the other microphone. Can you guys hear me? I don't

82
00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:16,009
know why nobody can hear me. No, you can't. Hold on. You're not alone. What? Add audio device.

83
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:44,900
Audio output. What was that? What was that? No, audio input is what I need. What was that?

84
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:51,539
What? I don't even know what that was. Was that the music? I haven't even started writing. Hold on.

85
00:17:51,539 --> 00:18:11,460
God damn it. Hold on. Audio input. Audio input capture. There we go. Hello? Choose your

86
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,799
input. Dude, this shit. I can't even capture the fucking microphone. Why?

87
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:28,019
I can't. I can't. Why can I not capture the microphone? All right. I'm writing. I'm going

88
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:43,299
for it. Who cares? Fuck it. Ready? Here we go. Nancy, right? I drank like a large coffee.

89
00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:58,410
Wait. This is going to be... Nancy, you can't even see. Look at... You can't even see it. I

90
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:14,599
got to zoom in it. It's so out of focus. I can't even read it. Enhance. I'm going to try to enhance

91
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:45,660
it. Hold on. Hold on. I need to enhance it. This camera sucks. Who cares? This camera sucks.

92
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:49,500
It doesn't matter. Nancy, I got... Okay. Let me see if I can get this correct. I got your

93
00:19:49,500 --> 00:20:20,869
contact info through a friend of mine. I got your contact info through a friend. Friend of mine,

94
00:20:20,869 --> 00:20:44,180
Mara... Mara Chisholm. Is that right? So far? I got your contact info through a friend of mine,

95
00:20:44,180 --> 00:21:12,680
Mara Chisholm. I think you did some good sleuthing work with her in Scotland not too long ago.

96
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:25,900
Okay. Am I actually going to write this? Why don't I just take a script? I'm not going to

97
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:40,339
write this whole letter. I'm not writing the whole letter. Who the fuck wants me to do this?

98
00:21:41,529 --> 00:21:48,789
Nobody wants me to do this. Nobody wants me to write the entire letter. You want me to write the

99
00:21:48,789 --> 00:22:14,170
entire letter? Where's some background on yours for a moment? Where's your background on yours truly?

100
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:33,799
You can officially call me a locator fucker. A locator of fine goods. All right, now here's

101
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:41,000
the real... What if I just drop this into somebody's mailbox? Be like, what the fuck is this person

102
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:53,029
talking about? Send this to a friend of mine with no return address? Send this to Burger Boy. He's

103
00:22:53,029 --> 00:23:05,319
going to be like, what in the name of fucking God is happening? Per se. Nice things get lost.

104
00:23:14,009 --> 00:23:25,190
You would think this person was insane. If I write this whole letter, I have to give it to somebody.

105
00:23:32,819 --> 00:23:36,740
I have to finish the letter. All right, once I finish the letter, we can do something else.

106
00:23:37,539 --> 00:23:45,799
I didn't even... I didn't even get one second into the game too. All right, I gotta hurry up.

107
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:51,960
I'm on two sentences. Get lost. Nice things get lost. Nice things stay buried for a while.

108
00:23:52,920 --> 00:24:11,589
Nice things get... For a while. I find the nice things. I get a piece of the... What? The pea?

109
00:24:11,589 --> 00:24:15,670
The pie? The piece of the pie? I get it. I get the nice things. I get a piece of the pie.

110
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:36,279
Okay, I get the nice things. I get a piece of the pie. In other words, I'm a treasure hunter.

111
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:58,660
Is that a new paragraph? In other words, that's so much space. God damn it. In other words,

112
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:07,460
I'm a treasure hunter. I have so much more to do. I have so much more to do.

113
00:25:08,099 --> 00:25:13,819
let's just let's cut let's cut to the currently I'm in Iceland in a small town

114
00:25:13,819 --> 00:25:34,720
we can skip the rest currently I'm in Iceland in a small town called skip

115
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:45,670
brought skip brought right when I first arrived of this is all this doesn't mean

116
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:51,769
I don't need any of this stuff keep going keep going keep going I don't know

117
00:25:51,769 --> 00:26:07,059
I people are leaving people leaving let's get to the end let's get to the end I

118
00:26:07,059 --> 00:26:21,700
helped to uh oh that's so funny imagine opening up a stream and the guys

119
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:55,420
writing a letter and you're like I'm fucking out of here uh-uh I helped to

120
00:26:55,420 --> 00:27:00,130
restore the ship along with my business partner this guy Magnus under two

121
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:03,690
conditions though one I would be entitled to a portion of any treasure found okay

122
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:17,440
cool I I'm not doing that we bled out like 500 people and the stream and even

123
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:45,940
started yet I'm not doing that why does this look so framerating oh I get to

124
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:55,900
backstabbing business partner Magnus I'm sensing you're a little stressed out

125
00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:00,220
about this oh I'm so mad I've been an inch away from setting this town on fire

126
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:06,980
like robot chicken are you okay what oh just the fire comment I thought metaphors

127
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:11,500
Nancy keep up with me here so listen right now I'm focused on this town

128
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:17,940
there's this ship in town that was being rebuilt real old 18th century I offered

129
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:21,460
to sponsor the rebuilding project to get the ship floating again mostly because

130
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:25,140
I'm super nice and cool like that but company spent also because there's a

131
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:31,460
room decades on the same engine on board worth millions Magnus man in charge of

132
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:36,099
the project and my business partner promised we'd find it and split the

133
00:28:36,099 --> 00:28:40,819
earnings but he's gone missing now so am I Nancy are you always Nancy and left

134
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:49,470
me looking like a fool okay was there any proof when did he

135
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:53,269
when did he vanish he disappeared sometime before our ship crashed into

136
00:28:53,269 --> 00:28:57,670

How do you, how do you, how do people do this?

on a table and like smoosh you.

153
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:47,130
This is how they had to do it.

154
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,930
There's no other way to do that.

155
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:03,279
Should I do more than one?

156
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:25,789
A bunch of kool-aid.

157
00:34:25,789 --> 00:34:28,289
Okay.

158
00:34:28,289 --> 00:34:30,289
Okay.

159
00:34:31,289 --> 00:34:33,909
It's like all over my head.

00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,980
Oh, okay.

161
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,980
I really gotta carry it away.

162
00:34:47,539 --> 00:34:50,099
It's blood.

163
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:52,099
It's blood now.

164
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:21,300
Christ.

165
00:35:41,909 --> 00:35:46,219
I didn't even know what I looked like until right now.

166
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:56,980
That's from smooshing my mouth.

167
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,980
You're a joker.

168
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:06,659
Nancy fucking Drew.

169
00:36:06,659 --> 00:36:11,210
I haven't even played a minute of it.

170
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:23,239
You don't know what you look like.

171
00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:27,239
I just, I ran in and grabbed one of Kim's lipsticks.

172
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:32,170
Look, look, look, look.

173
00:36:38,739 --> 00:36:40,739
That's a little kid.

174
00:36:40,739 --> 00:36:42,739
That ate too much, look it,

175
00:36:42,739 --> 00:36:45,739
comical how much chocolate is on that kid's mouth.

176
00:36:45,739 --> 00:36:47,739
Except it's not, it's lipstick.

177
00:36:47,739 --> 00:37:01,309
It's, how was I eating it?

178
00:37:01,309 --> 00:37:03,309
No, that's, it was on kind of normally

179
00:37:03,309 --> 00:37:06,309
and then I smooshed my face into the desk.

180
00:37:06,309 --> 00:37:08,309
Is it still, yeah, it's still there.

181
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:10,309
What do you think, it disappeared?

182
00:37:10,309 --> 00:37:13,809
You got it in mommy's lipstick drawer.

183
00:37:13,809 --> 00:37:27,929
Uh, okay, I, um,

184
00:37:27,929 --> 00:37:29,929
What do I wanna do? I can't leave again.

185
00:37:29,929 --> 00:37:31,929
I've left like six times.

186
00:37:31,929 --> 00:37:35,420
I've left so many times.

187
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,420
It's music.

188
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:42,420
Okay, I need to compose myself here.

189
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:46,500
Oh my God, why did you give that many subs?

190
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:52,980
Jerma sucks just gave 61 subs?

191
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:58,139
Holy shit, dude.

192
00:37:58,139 --> 00:38:00,900
What are you doing?

193
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:08,809
That's a lot, thank you for the huge sub drop.

194
00:38:08,809 --> 00:38:10,809
That's a lot of money, thank you.

195
00:38:10,809 --> 00:38:13,369
Dude, go gaming.

196
00:38:15,309 --> 00:38:19,309

Raphrod, ten community subs from Raphrod, thank you Raphrod.

200
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:52,030
Am I gonna just stream like this?

201
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:55,030
When I take a break, I'll get it on.

202
00:39:01,699 --> 00:39:10,090
I, I'll just wait, I'll take a, I just, let me in one minute.

203
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:13,090
What do people in town think of the dis, I don't even know what's going on.

204
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:15,090
We shall,

205
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:18,090
What's with the, why's the audio so low?

206
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:25,090
Leave it on, no, I can't.

207
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:30,090
Without a body, you're still convinced he faked his death?

208
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:33,090
Yep, which apparently doesn't take a lot of work in Iceland.

209
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:36,260
I do have it all over my hands.

210
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:40,260
Oh my god, what the hell, what's going on, what, oh my gosh, Coke, are you serious?

211
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:44,320
Okay.

212
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,320
I'll let you go.

213
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,880
Stay warm.

214
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,880
Okay, so, explore the town, search the ship.

215
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:56,369
How do you walk?

216
00:39:56,369 --> 00:39:58,369
Alright, explore the town, I wanna go check out the ship.

217
00:39:58,369 --> 00:40:04,659
Spamming it in channel points, oh yeah, I have to do channel points, I forgot.

218
00:40:04,659 --> 00:40:09,119
What about the rope?

219
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:11,119
The gangway is missing, there's no way on board.

220
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:13,119
I need a new gangway?

221
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,360
What?

222
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,980
Oh my god, what is this, what is this, oh my god, are you serious?

223
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:17,980
Coke gaming.

224
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:27,820
So I, I need a, I need a, I need a new one.

225
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:32,230
Alright, I, I have to go.

226
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:38,230
I have to like, not like leave, I have to like, this is like, I feel like, I don't know why, I feel like this is like seeping, I feel like this is seeping into my bloodstream.

227
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:40,230
I really do.

228
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:42,230
I really feel like this is like seeping into my bloodstream.

229
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,230
Alright, I'll be back.

230
00:40:43,230 --> 00:42:57,420
Give me the...

231
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:03,110
It's not, it's not working.

232
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:08,110
It's not working, I just like ate, like I just ate like a person.

233
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:11,110
What did I eat right here?

234
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:12,110
Get off!

235
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:18,510
I just went hunting.

236
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:26,500
Like in a pack.

237
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:30,380
Flaming hot Cheetos.

238
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:36,380
If anybody asks, I really like flaming hot Cheetos to the fact that I'm permanently stained.

239
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:48,679
I'm willing to do this because like, fuck it, who cares, ready?

240
00:43:48,679 --> 00:43:55,070
I'm just gonna pretend like I'm shit-faced on like really, really heavy red wine.

241
00:43:55,070 --> 00:44:17,409
What, what, what does this mean?

242
00:44:17,409 --> 00:44:19,840
What does this mean?

243
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:31,400
Why, oh that's from, okay.

244
00:44:31,400 --> 00:45:28,579
Uh, yeah, so if you guys, I'd stick on.

245
00:45:28,579 --> 00:45:30,579
I drank three of them.

246
00:45:30,579 --> 00:45:39,929
Is someone on my camera?

247
00:45:39,929 --> 00:45:43,280
Hey, thanks.

248
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,650
Thanks a lot, Coke gaming.

249
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:55,849
Let's go.

250
00:45:55,849 --> 00:46:00,840
So what do you guys want to do?

251
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:03,269
I can barely do anything.

252
00:46:03,269 --> 00:46:09,269
I really don't want to lie to you guys, but I seriously fucking can't do shit right now.

253
00:46:09,269 --> 00:46:25,329
I, we were gonna play Nancy Drew, but I don't even, I don't even remember what the first part of it was.

254
00:46:25,329 --> 00:46:35,309
TF2, play TF2.

255
00:46:35,309 --> 00:46:37,309
I'm not playing TF2.

256
00:46:37,309 --> 00:46:41,019
Why would I play TF2 right now?

257
00:46:41,019 --> 00:46:43,019
It's not fucking gonna happen.

258
00:46:43,019 --> 00:47:04,969
Uh, I think we'll, um, I think we'll probably have to call it today here, I think.

259
00:47:04,969 --> 00:47:12,650
I think we'll, uh, drink more.

260
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:16,139
Somebody's been that person.

261
00:47:16,139 --> 00:47:35,920
You didn't go off camera.

262
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,349
Shut the fuck up.

263
00:47:38,349 --> 00:47:40,349
You fucking idiot.

264
00:47:40,349 --> 00:47:42,349
Shut the fuck up.

265
00:47:42,349 --> 00:47:49,969
Go to sleep.

266
00:47:49,969 --> 00:47:52,659
I don't, I don't have to go to sleep.

267
00:47:52,659 --> 00:47:53,659
I don't have to go to sleep.

268
00:47:53,659 --> 00:47:55,659
I'm an adult.

269
00:47:55,659 --> 00:48:00,139
I'm an adult.

270
00:48:00,139 --> 00:48:11,460
Okay, I'm getting off the camera.

271
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:24,860
But seriously though, um, I, I can't get this off.

272
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:35,829
I'm just making it worse.

273
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:40,710
I'm just getting, hold on, let me fix my like disgusting hair.

274
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:42,710
I'm just getting like red face.

275
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:44,710
You know, it's like spreading.

276
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:45,710
I need toothpaste.

277
00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:46,710
I need a special tissue.

278
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:48,710
I, Kim has this stuff.

279
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:58,800
I've just, I'm just gonna be wine mouthed.

280
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:59,800
All right, let's go.

281
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,800
Let's play Nancy Drew.

282
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:07,860
Uh, this, what?

283
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:15,650
Dude, this, the stream has been going for an hour.

284
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:21,730
Holy shit.

285
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:22,730
Wow.

286
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:25,480
All right, Nancy Drew, let's go.

287
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:33,429
Seriously though, on my next pee break, I'm gonna have to put like vinegar all over my mouth.

288
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:35,500
I don't know what to do.

289
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,500
All right, let's explore the town.

290
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:47,039
Uh, meat?

291
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:48,039
Is this meat?

292
00:49:48,039 --> 00:49:52,239
Chaos at Skip Brock commerce meeting.

293
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:57,619
What's the, what the fuck was that?

294
00:49:57,619 --> 00:49:58,619
What's the lipstick brand?

295
00:49:58,619 --> 00:50:01,619
I don't know.

296
00:50:01,619 --> 00:50:02,920
Kim's.

297
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:04,920
Kim's lipstick.

298
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:09,099
The color, um, big red.

299
00:50:09,099 --> 00:50:10,099
I don't know.

300
00:50:10,099 --> 00:50:11,099
It's Kim's.

301
00:50:11,099 --> 00:50:12,099
Okay.

302
00:50:12,099 --> 00:50:16,360
Town hall meeting this week erupted into discord when a local fisherman caused a scene of what

303
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:19,360
he calls a threat to score Icelandic values.

304
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:24,360
Skip Brock citizen Gunnar Tonneson brought a written petition to the meeting, hoping to

305
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:29,360
interrupt the board's vote on fiscal allocation for the annual ancestors festival.

306
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,360
A lot of reading.

307
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:34,619
Ooh, it's a hook.

308
00:50:34,619 --> 00:50:35,619
A meat hook.

309
00:50:35,619 --> 00:50:43,300
A discord town hall meeting.

310
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:46,630
All right, I got a meat hook.

311
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:52,559
This is a measty skip.

312
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:54,989
The measty skip.

313
00:50:54,989 --> 00:50:58,769
Measty skip.

314
00:50:58,769 --> 00:51:02,480
Sleep near.

315
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:18,380
That's Star Wars.

316
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:20,769
Okay.

317
00:51:20,769 --> 00:51:21,769
I was wondering what the hell that was.

318
00:51:21,769 --> 00:51:26,909
All right.

319
00:51:26,909 --> 00:51:27,909
Is this a menu?

320
00:51:27,909 --> 00:51:28,909
This is a dining room.

321
00:51:28,909 --> 00:51:29,909
Good day.

322
00:51:29,909 --> 00:51:30,909
Good day.

323
00:51:30,909 --> 00:51:31,909
Hi there.

324
00:51:31,909 --> 00:51:32,909
I'm investigating a recent disappearance.

325
00:51:32,909 --> 00:51:33,909
My name's Nancy Drew.

326
00:51:33,909 --> 00:51:34,909
Speak up, girl.

327
00:51:34,909 --> 00:51:35,909
My name's Nancy Drew.

328
00:51:35,909 --> 00:51:36,909
Louder.

329
00:51:36,909 --> 00:51:37,909
I said my name's Nancy Drew.

330
00:51:37,909 --> 00:51:38,909
Mind your ship flag and temper.

331
00:51:38,909 --> 00:51:39,909
Looks like we have a real angry one here.

332
00:51:39,909 --> 00:51:40,909
Uh.

333
00:51:40,909 --> 00:51:41,909
Name's Gunnar.

334
00:51:41,909 --> 00:51:42,909
What you can call me, Gunnar.

335
00:51:42,909 --> 00:51:43,909
Gunnar.

336
00:51:43,909 --> 00:51:44,909
The skip is my home.

337
00:51:44,909 --> 00:51:45,909
Oh.

338
00:51:45,909 --> 00:51:46,909
What?

339
00:51:47,909 --> 00:51:48,909
Louder.

340
00:51:48,909 --> 00:51:49,909
Louder.

341
00:51:49,909 --> 00:51:50,909
Are you a sailor?

342
00:51:50,909 --> 00:51:51,909
Are you a sailor?

343
00:51:51,909 --> 00:51:52,909
Was.

344
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:53,909
Long ago.

345
00:51:53,909 --> 00:51:54,909
I gave up the sea for good.

346
00:51:54,909 --> 00:51:55,909
And I'll never sail again.

347
00:51:55,909 --> 00:51:56,909
You still look like a sailor to me.

348
00:51:56,909 --> 00:51:57,909
Whoa.

349
00:51:57,909 --> 00:51:58,909
What does a sailor look like?

350
00:51:58,909 --> 00:51:59,909
It's a certain quality.

351
00:51:59,909 --> 00:52:00,909
I can't quite place it.

352
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:01,909
Worn?

353
00:52:01,909 --> 00:52:02,909
Broken?

354
00:52:02,909 --> 00:52:03,909
Bitter?

355
00:52:03,909 --> 00:52:04,909
I don't know.

356
00:52:04,909 --> 00:52:05,909
I don't know.

357
00:52:05,909 --> 00:52:06,909
I don't know.

358
00:52:06,909 --> 00:52:07,909
I don't know.

359
00:52:07,909 --> 00:52:08,909
I don't know.

360
00:52:08,909 --> 00:52:09,909
I don't know.

361
00:52:09,909 --> 00:52:10,909
I don't know.

362
00:52:10,909 --> 00:52:11,909
I don't know.

363
00:52:11,909 --> 00:52:12,909
I don't know.

364
00:52:12,909 --> 00:52:13,909
I don't know.

365
00:52:13,909 --> 00:52:14,909
I don't know.

366
00:52:14,909 --> 00:52:15,909
Broken?

367
00:52:15,909 --> 00:52:16,909
Bitter?

368
00:52:16,909 --> 00:52:21,909
The sea chewed me up and spat me back out, and I lost everything in her waves.

369
00:52:21,909 --> 00:52:23,909
If you can do a convincing Scottish accent...

370
00:52:23,909 --> 00:52:27,909
I bet you'd not last one minute against some of the gays I've sailed.

371
00:52:27,909 --> 00:52:29,909
You will always have voice work.

372
00:52:29,909 --> 00:52:31,909
I'm so surprisingly hard to kill.

373
00:52:31,909 --> 00:52:35,909
Well, we'll see about that, detective, won't we?

374
00:52:35,909 --> 00:52:41,239
Someone's always looking for the Scottish accent.

375
00:52:41,239 --> 00:52:43,239
No matter what, it doesn't matter.

376
00:52:43,239 --> 00:52:49,469
What are you talking about?

377
00:52:49,469 --> 00:52:50,469
What are you talking about?

378
00:52:50,469 --> 00:52:51,469
This is not Scottish.

379
00:52:51,469 --> 00:52:52,469
What is this?

380
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:53,469
What is it?

381
00:52:53,469 --> 00:53:00,130
It's not Icelandic?

382
00:53:00,130 --> 00:53:05,119
Did you know, Magnus?

383
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:06,119
What?

384
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:07,119
Sure did.

385
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:08,119
Never liked him.

386
00:53:08,119 --> 00:53:12,449
Did something happen between you two?

387
00:53:12,449 --> 00:53:14,449
No, I don't like anyone.

388
00:53:14,449 --> 00:53:16,449
I don't think I like you.

389
00:53:16,449 --> 00:53:18,449
I'm still going it over.

390
00:53:18,449 --> 00:53:19,449
Norwegian chat.

391
00:53:19,449 --> 00:53:21,449
Icelandic is nothing like this.

392
00:53:21,449 --> 00:53:22,449
Thank you!

393
00:53:23,449 --> 00:53:29,329
So you were wrong, too.

394
00:53:29,329 --> 00:53:31,329
I was wrong and you were wrong.

395
00:53:31,329 --> 00:53:33,329
We both get to be equally wrong.

396
00:53:33,329 --> 00:53:34,329
It's good.

397
00:53:34,329 --> 00:53:36,329
What about your fingers?

398
00:53:36,329 --> 00:53:38,329
So, about your fingers...

399
00:53:38,329 --> 00:53:39,329
My lucky three?

400
00:53:39,329 --> 00:53:41,329
Is that what you call them?

401
00:53:41,329 --> 00:53:42,329
Sure is.

402
00:53:42,329 --> 00:53:43,329
It's a long story.

403
00:53:43,329 --> 00:53:45,329
Now, there I was.

404
00:53:45,329 --> 00:53:51,329
Out in the peach black of night, with no sign of shore and only my fishing spear.

405
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:54,329
Then suddenly, I saw a shadow.

406
00:53:54,329 --> 00:53:57,329
It was a mighty squid, the greatest hunter of them all.

407
00:53:57,329 --> 00:53:58,329
That's a lie.

408
00:53:58,329 --> 00:54:01,329
Few men have had to sit and tell the tale.

409
00:54:01,329 --> 00:54:04,329
So I pulled out my spear just a little too fast, mind you.

410
00:54:04,329 --> 00:54:07,329
And that's how you lost your fingers?

411
00:54:07,329 --> 00:54:10,590
Of course not!

412
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:14,590
I drew the spear right overboard and I hauled that fellow into my net.

413
00:54:14,590 --> 00:54:17,590
Took all my weight, used to keep him from wriggling free.

414
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:20,590
But his strength proved too much for me.

415
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:24,590
He gnashed his giant beak and, well, I was done for.

416
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:26,590
So the squid took your fingers?

417
00:54:26,590 --> 00:54:27,590
No, no, no, no!

418
00:54:27,590 --> 00:54:33,590
Right as I thought I was dead, a massive shark leapt out of the waves and ate the squid.

419
00:54:33,590 --> 00:54:34,590
It was the sleeper shark.

420
00:54:34,590 --> 00:54:38,590
It stalled six meters long with four rows of teeth.

421
00:54:38,590 --> 00:54:42,590
He bit my arm and pulled me under as I gasped for my last breath.

422
00:54:42,590 --> 00:54:44,590
So it was a shark then?

423
00:54:44,590 --> 00:54:45,590
No!

424
00:54:45,590 --> 00:54:48,590
I managed to punch him in the nose!

425
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:50,590
Did you ever fight a shark?

426
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:52,590
You know how to punch him in the nose?

427
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:56,590
He let me go, I swam like a merman and made it back to shore.

428
00:54:56,590 --> 00:54:59,590
Three months later, I was in a wood shop accident.

429
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:01,590
Right, that's what it is then.

430
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:03,590
That's what I knew it would be.

431
00:55:03,590 --> 00:55:06,590
At least it makes for a great story.

432
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:09,789
Yeah, I mean that's...

433
00:55:09,789 --> 00:55:13,949
That's a...

434
00:55:13,949 --> 00:55:16,829
Have you met Dagny?

435
00:55:16,829 --> 00:55:17,829
Who?

436
00:55:17,829 --> 00:55:19,829
This guy is based.

437
00:55:19,829 --> 00:55:21,829
The Republic High's restoration.

438
00:55:21,829 --> 00:55:23,829
Brown hair about Yehai?

439
00:55:23,829 --> 00:55:27,829
Ah, a tough little mink of a woman.

440
00:55:27,829 --> 00:55:28,829
Not bad in my book.

441
00:55:28,829 --> 00:55:31,829
Did you see her the day of the ship crash?

442
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:36,199
Yeah, she was there, but I paid no attention to the mink.

443
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:38,380
Okay, um...

444
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:40,380
I heard you had problems with the festival the last couple of years.

445
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:44,380
I heard you've had problems with the festival the last couple of years.

446
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:46,380
Care to talk about that?

447
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:49,380
The festival is not what it once was.

448
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:54,380
I turn things to the old ways no matter how many buckets of hot tar I have to dump.

449
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:56,380
Why are you dumping hot tar?

450
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:58,380
Some of the harbor boats still have holes in their bottoms.

451
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:02,380
I see. Did you have a plan like that for this year too?

452
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:06,380
Elisabeth said no more trouble or she kicks me out of the skip.

453
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:08,380
I only pay with an angry sheep.

454
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:10,380
What does that mean?

455
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:13,380
Means I do it, but I don't like it.

456
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:15,380
Oh.

457
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:18,380
I'm sorry, I'm new around here.

458
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:24,300
Be gone with you.

459
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:30,880
Did you just...

460
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,880
Learn Icelandic and earn...

461
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,880
Kromer!

462
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,570
Yeah, let's do it.

463
00:56:37,570 --> 00:56:39,570
People.

464
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:41,000

Júkrúnafrún.

482
00:57:25,659 --> 00:57:29,500
Okay, I can't do that one.

483
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:32,500
Parents is a forreal drawer.

00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:36,500

485
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:38,059
Let's try it.

00:57:44,179 --> 00:57:46,449

00:58:05,389 --> 00:58:08,389
Sailor is sielur.

00:58:08,389 --> 00:58:11,949
Magician is galdremor.

498
00:58:11,949 --> 00:58:13,769

Husband.

500
00:58:14,769 --> 00:58:15,769
Kona.

501
00:58:15,769 --> 00:58:18,800
Kona.

502
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:22,860
Eginwar?

503
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:26,159
I'm going to say it's that.

504
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:27,159
Got it.

505
00:58:27,159 --> 00:58:33,170
Jósmidari is, I don't know, photographer?

506
00:58:33,170 --> 00:58:34,170
I don't remember.

507
00:58:34,170 --> 00:58:36,599
I think it's photographer.

508
00:58:36,599 --> 00:58:42,380
Domari is judj.

509
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:46,889
Friend.

510
00:58:46,889 --> 00:58:47,889
Mother.

511
00:58:47,889 --> 00:58:48,889
Got it.

512
00:58:48,889 --> 00:58:49,889
You guys don't think I know Icelandic.

513
00:58:49,889 --> 00:58:51,769
Parents.

514
00:58:52,769 --> 00:59:01,269
Sister is definitely sister.

515
00:59:01,269 --> 00:59:02,269
Kinaari.

516
00:59:02,269 --> 00:59:03,269
Teacher?

517
00:59:03,269 --> 00:59:04,699
Or parents.

518
00:59:04,699 --> 00:59:07,260
It's probably parents.

519
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:09,440
Sister.

520
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:12,809
Forrealdar is parents.

521
00:59:12,809 --> 00:59:13,809
Got it.

522
00:59:13,809 --> 00:59:14,809
I win.

523
00:59:14,809 --> 00:59:15,809
Congratulations.

524
00:59:15,809 --> 00:59:17,809
You earned 600 bucks.

525
00:59:17,809 --> 00:59:20,940
I'll take it.

526
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:31,369
Why wouldn't you just sit here if you knew English and Icelandic?

527
00:59:31,369 --> 00:59:39,130
Wouldn't you just sit here and just print free money forever?

528
00:59:39,130 --> 00:59:43,130
This seems like a lot of money to learn just basic words.

529
00:59:43,130 --> 00:59:45,500
And there's nobody here.

530
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:47,500
You could just sit there all day.

531
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:53,019
You could just sit there and just, I know what that word is, and then go order another drink.

532
00:59:53,019 --> 00:59:55,510
Alright, this is employees only.

533
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:58,010
Fuck it, go in.

534
00:59:58,010 --> 00:59:59,010
Gasoline.

535
00:59:59,010 --> 01:00:00,010
I'll take it.

536
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:16,780
It's five or six bucks.

537
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:17,780
Damn.

538
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,780
That's a lot.

539
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:48,659
Well, maybe if you weren't given away $3,000 a night.

540
01:00:48,659 --> 01:00:52,659
$3,000 a night to people that knew what father was in Icelandic.

541
01:00:52,659 --> 01:01:07,360
We wouldn't be in this position.

542
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:10,920
I'm trying to get the lipstick off my mouth.

543
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:11,920
Hold on.

544
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:22,750
I wouldn't be sitting here discussing it with you.

545
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:25,179
Now would I?

546
01:01:25,179 --> 01:01:29,739
What makes me a good dimwit?

547
01:01:29,739 --> 01:01:34,929
Alright, is it gone?

548
01:01:34,929 --> 01:01:38,579
I've been sitting here this whole time.

549
01:01:38,579 --> 01:01:39,579
Is it actually gone?

550
01:01:39,579 --> 01:01:40,579
It might be.

551
01:01:40,579 --> 01:01:42,519
Let's see.

552
01:01:42,519 --> 01:01:43,760
No.

553
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:44,760
Not even close.

554
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:45,760
It's better.

555
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:53,780
Alright, so I got gasoline.

556
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:57,820
Get olive oil.

557
01:01:57,820 --> 01:02:00,889
Who's been sitting here watching me?

558
01:02:00,889 --> 01:02:08,670
Well, I can't, my mouth feels, my mouth hurts.

559
01:02:08,670 --> 01:02:11,849
Am I allergic to lipstick?

560
01:02:11,849 --> 01:02:14,110
What's this?

561
01:02:14,110 --> 01:02:15,670
Full, I can do this.

562
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:16,670
Skip rot, a history.

563
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:17,670
It's 450 bucks.

564
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:25,219
I can do that.

565
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:58,750
The people of Skip rot struggled to survive and his crew were rescued and taken in.

566
01:02:58,750 --> 01:02:59,750
Okay.

567
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:13,150
Let's just make some money.

568
01:03:13,150 --> 01:03:14,150
No, no, that's magician.

569
01:03:14,150 --> 01:03:19,969
That's musician, sister, writer.

570
01:03:19,969 --> 01:03:23,969
That's child.

571
01:03:23,969 --> 01:03:26,969
That's veterinarian, Barnas child.

572
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:31,500
Fuck.

573
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:34,800
Friendy is uncle.

574
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:37,039
Hi nurse.

575
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:38,039
Got it.

576
01:03:38,039 --> 01:03:39,039
Okay.

577
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:41,599
I didn't study this one.

578
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:42,599
That's mother.

579
01:03:42,599 --> 01:03:46,340
That's father.

580
01:03:46,340 --> 01:03:48,340
Switch them.

581
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:50,340
You aren't, do it again.

582
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:55,739
I'm just going to have, I'm just going to keep doing it.

583
01:03:55,739 --> 01:04:02,019
For real door is just, can I just do this forever?

584
01:04:02,019 --> 01:04:09,590
And just till I have like $5,000?

585
01:04:09,590 --> 01:04:11,900
I don't, I don't remember these.

586
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:20,829
Which one was it?

587
01:04:20,829 --> 01:04:25,829
Sailor, husband, grandfather, magician.

588
01:04:25,829 --> 01:04:28,519
That's aunt.

589
01:04:28,519 --> 01:04:29,519
That's musician.

590
01:04:29,519 --> 01:04:30,519
This is doctor.

591
01:04:30,519 --> 01:04:31,519
That's soldier.

592
01:04:31,519 --> 01:04:32,519
I got it wrong.

593
01:04:32,519 --> 01:04:33,519
It's okay.

594
01:04:33,519 --> 01:04:34,519
Got 500 bucks.

595
01:04:34,519 --> 01:04:39,090
Another one.

596
01:04:39,090 --> 01:04:42,119
Pull my finger.

597
01:04:42,119 --> 01:04:46,340
I don't know.

598
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:49,969
Thumb, mouth, cheek, tooth.

599
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:50,969
Got it.

600
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:57,260
I'm going to say foot.

601
01:05:23,570 --> 01:05:29,780
Brain is probably, one more, one more, one more, one more.

602
01:05:29,780 --> 01:05:34,210
I still want to, I just want to, I'm almost done.

603
01:05:34,210 --> 01:05:43,769
Sailor.

604
01:05:43,769 --> 01:05:44,769
I'm actually learning Icelandic.

605
01:05:44,769 --> 01:05:46,769
This is pretty cool.

606
01:05:46,769 --> 01:05:49,969
I'm learning Icelandic.

607
01:05:49,969 --> 01:05:50,969
I know these words now.

608
01:05:50,969 --> 01:05:52,969
These have a pop up ever again.

609
01:05:52,969 --> 01:05:56,679
You're addicted to Icelandic.

610
01:05:56,679 --> 01:05:58,980
No, I'm addicted to making $5,000.

611
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:00,980
So I never have to make money again.

612
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:03,980
So I just walk around with a huge purse full of money.

613
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:07,139
Okay.

614
01:06:07,139 --> 01:06:10,139
It was mother, judge, doctor.

615
01:06:10,139 --> 01:06:11,139
Yeah.

616
01:06:11,139 --> 01:06:12,139
Go.

617
01:06:12,139 --> 01:06:13,139
Oops.

618
01:06:13,139 --> 01:06:14,139
It's all right.

619
01:06:14,139 --> 01:06:15,139
I just want 2,000.

620
01:06:15,139 --> 01:06:16,139
That's all I want.

621
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:17,139
$2,000.

622
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:18,380
I just got to get them all out there.

623
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:19,380
Okay.

624
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:25,929
A friend is, teacher is, I fucked it up.

625
01:06:25,929 --> 01:06:26,929
Don't matter.

626
01:06:26,929 --> 01:06:27,929
Father.

627
01:06:27,929 --> 01:06:34,329
Grandmother is this one.

628
01:06:34,329 --> 01:06:36,329
Nurse is this one.

629
01:06:36,329 --> 01:06:38,329
I fucked it up.

630
01:06:38,329 --> 01:06:39,329
All right.

631
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:40,329
I got exactly 2,000.

632
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:41,329
That's why I messed those ones up.

633
01:06:41,329 --> 01:06:42,329
I'm done.

634
01:06:42,329 --> 01:06:44,530
All right.

635
01:06:44,530 --> 01:06:45,530
Let's, what do I need?

636
01:06:46,530 --> 01:06:47,530
Can I look at the bar?

637
01:06:47,530 --> 01:06:51,329
I can go through here.

638
01:06:51,329 --> 01:06:53,460
What's this?

639
01:06:53,460 --> 01:06:56,460
Gunner, I'm going to be spending all my time on the ship over the festival weekend.

640
01:06:56,460 --> 01:06:58,460
As a reminder, here are the rules in my absence.

641
01:06:58,460 --> 01:07:00,460
All mugs and dishes must be cleaned.

642
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:02,460
Customers must be served promptly.

643
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:04,460
Yes, even if they are tourists.

644
01:07:04,460 --> 01:07:08,460
Don't call customers weak spined ninny faces.

645
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:10,460
No challenging customers to fights.

646
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:12,460
Yes, this includes arm wrestling.

647
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:20,579
I'm not going to write this.

648
01:07:20,579 --> 01:07:22,579
Write and kiss another letter.

649
01:07:22,579 --> 01:07:30,699
No, I'm not putting more lip, I can't get this off.

650
01:07:30,699 --> 01:07:31,699
This is not even a letter.

651
01:07:31,699 --> 01:07:38,550
This is notes for the write and kiss, write and kiss.

652
01:07:38,550 --> 01:07:39,550
Nope.

653
01:07:39,550 --> 01:08:00,929
No, I'm not putting lipstick on.

654
01:08:00,929 --> 01:08:02,929
Again, I can't get it off.

655
01:08:02,929 --> 01:08:06,380
Probably shouldn't be back there.

656
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:07,380
Can I put the hook in?

657
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:11,699
No.

658
01:08:11,699 --> 01:08:12,699
All right.

659
01:08:12,699 --> 01:08:15,219
So I got gas.

660
01:08:15,219 --> 01:08:16,220
What do I need?

661
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:17,220
This is so neat.

662
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:19,220
I wish I could play these.

663
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:21,970
You can just do it.

664
01:08:30,140 --> 01:09:10,840
I'd imagine text popping up at the bottom of the screen and they're talking to me.

665
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:23,789
Sure.

666
01:09:23,789 --> 01:09:26,439
I'll help.

667
01:09:26,439 --> 01:09:27,439
Cello.

668
01:09:27,439 --> 01:09:28,439
Liar.

669
01:09:28,439 --> 01:09:29,439
Langspiel.

670
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:31,510
Fiola.

671
01:09:31,510 --> 01:09:32,510
Gigia?

672
01:09:32,510 --> 01:09:33,510
Harp.

673
01:09:33,510 --> 01:09:35,520
Know your instruments.

674
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:36,520
Ooh.

675
01:09:36,520 --> 01:10:07,510
These are don't starve voices.

676
01:10:07,510 --> 01:10:19,800
Don't starve.

677
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:32,720
It's at this point that somebody's just like, stop doing that.

678
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:33,720
Yes, they're instruments.

679
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:34,720
Yes, they're on the wall.

680
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:39,819
You're not the first person to walk up and go like this.

681
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:42,140
Please.

682
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:44,140
Endless night, endless tunes.

683
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:49,090
Elizabeth Grimer's daughter.

684
01:10:49,090 --> 01:10:52,720
That means daughter.

685
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:55,720
The Landlubbers, a night of Icelandic classics.

686
01:10:55,720 --> 01:11:00,149
Featuring Neo J. Mel, Corvallis J., Seeker Rose J., B. York.

687
01:11:00,149 --> 01:11:02,149
That's a long fucking name.

688
01:11:02,149 --> 01:11:09,119
Neo J. Mel, Corvallis J., Seeker Rose J., B. York.

689
01:11:09,119 --> 01:11:14,560
That's you.

690
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:18,500
I know it's multiple things.

691
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:23,140
All right.

692
01:11:23,140 --> 01:11:28,789
That was fun.

693
01:11:28,789 --> 01:11:29,789
Can I touch the fire?

694
01:11:29,789 --> 01:11:35,380
No.

695
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:36,380
All right.

696
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:40,310
Let me get out of here.

697
01:11:40,310 --> 01:11:41,310
I got the gas.

698
01:11:41,310 --> 01:11:43,579
Wait, what's this?

699
01:11:43,579 --> 01:11:44,579
I can't interact with that.

700
01:11:44,579 --> 01:11:45,880
Why the fuck not?

701
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:47,630
All right.

702
01:11:47,630 --> 01:11:51,430
I'm out.

703
01:11:51,430 --> 01:11:52,430
I'm out.

704
01:11:52,430 --> 01:11:53,430
Should I do part two?

705
01:11:53,430 --> 01:11:56,850
No.

706
01:11:56,850 --> 01:11:57,850
Who gives a shit?

707
01:11:57,850 --> 01:12:03,760
I'm saving my money.

708
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:04,760
Customize your gear.

709
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:06,130
Great.

710
01:12:06,130 --> 01:12:14,279
Do I have to remember this?

711
01:12:14,279 --> 01:12:19,810
Music book.

712
01:12:19,810 --> 01:12:20,810
Current tide is low.

713
01:12:20,810 --> 01:12:24,369
I should try to get some sleep while I'm here.

714
01:12:24,369 --> 01:12:25,369
Write that down.

715
01:12:25,369 --> 01:12:32,750
What am I going to bed?

716
01:12:32,750 --> 01:12:33,750
Is this Christmas?

717
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:36,310
This is the perfect game to play right now.

718
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:40,189
I didn't know this takes place in Christmas.

719
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:41,189
That's kind of cool.

720
01:12:41,189 --> 01:12:44,029
Where's my hotel?

721
01:12:44,029 --> 01:12:51,989
Probably here.

722
01:12:51,989 --> 01:12:52,989
Can I get on the?

723
01:12:52,989 --> 01:12:53,989
No keys.

724
01:12:53,989 --> 01:12:55,989
Guess I can't just take them.

725
01:12:55,989 --> 01:12:56,989
No keys.

726
01:12:56,989 --> 01:12:58,170
Hmm.

727
01:12:58,170 --> 01:13:01,970
Hmm.

728
01:13:01,970 --> 01:13:06,100
I feel like this is my live stream.

729
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:09,100
When you know you haven't spoken, you haven't said anything in about like 30 seconds.

730
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:12,100
So you're like, fuck, I have to say something.

731
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:13,100
Hmm.

732
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:16,250
Hmm.

733
01:13:16,250 --> 01:13:17,250
I got nothing.

734
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:18,250
I have nothing to say right now.

735
01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:20,250
And like, there are people that are watching this stream.

736
01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:21,250
Uh.

737
01:13:21,250 --> 01:13:23,449
Okay.

738
01:13:23,449 --> 01:13:24,449
That works.

739
01:13:24,449 --> 01:13:27,609
Good.

740
01:13:27,609 --> 01:13:28,609
He's inactive.

741
01:13:28,609 --> 01:13:29,609
All right.

742
01:13:29,609 --> 01:13:30,609
I need to go to the inn.

743
01:13:30,609 --> 01:13:33,810
Can I, is it like a, can I go to sleep?

744
01:13:33,810 --> 01:13:40,300
Culture center?

745
01:13:40,300 --> 01:13:42,750
This person's scary.

746
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:44,989
I don't know what it is about.

747
01:13:44,989 --> 01:13:51,619
It's the fact that they're the two different styles of, you're like lit improperly.

748
01:13:51,619 --> 01:13:55,329
Like you're a hologram.

749
01:13:55,329 --> 01:13:58,329
This just looks, just seems, this is freaking me out.

750
01:13:58,329 --> 01:14:15,949
Oh, simulate your fear.

751
01:14:15,949 --> 01:14:21,760
You got me.

752
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:23,319
You got me.

753
01:14:23,319 --> 01:14:26,159
All right.

754
01:14:26,159 --> 01:14:27,159
Well, that's cool.

755
01:14:27,159 --> 01:14:29,159
Learn to speak like a sailor aboard a tall ship.

756
01:14:29,159 --> 01:14:30,159
Touch to begin.

757
01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:32,159
You need to match each sail to its name.

758
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:33,159
What?

759
01:14:33,159 --> 01:14:36,060
Is this Iceland?

760
01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:37,060
Is this Icelandic?

761
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:42,020
Jib.

762
01:14:42,020 --> 01:14:43,020
I don't know.

763
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:44,020
I don't know.

764
01:14:44,020 --> 01:14:46,149
Okay.

765
01:14:46,149 --> 01:14:47,390
This is, what do I?

766
01:14:47,390 --> 01:14:48,390
Boat.

767
01:14:48,390 --> 01:14:50,270
The main top mast stay sail.

768
01:14:50,270 --> 01:14:52,109
The missing top galant sail.

769
01:14:52,109 --> 01:14:53,109
Okay.

770
01:14:53,109 --> 01:14:54,989
This is, what's a jib?

771
01:14:54,989 --> 01:14:59,939
I have no idea what any of this stuff is.

772
01:14:59,939 --> 01:15:01,579
There's this much shit on a boat.

773
01:15:01,579 --> 01:15:07,960
I thought it was a big bed sheet, like two big bed sheets on two large poles.

774
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:08,960
I don't know.

775
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:12,699
There was this many segments.

776
01:15:12,699 --> 01:15:13,699
I don't even know.

777
01:15:13,699 --> 01:15:15,770
What's a jib?

778
01:15:15,770 --> 01:15:25,979
The, uh, the four top sail, main top sail.

779
01:15:25,979 --> 01:15:30,100
You need to find the treasures learning about the ship.

780
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:32,739
Where's the jib?

781
01:15:32,739 --> 01:15:33,739
All right.

782
01:15:33,739 --> 01:15:34,739
Um, I don't care.

783
01:15:34,739 --> 01:15:35,739
Parts of a ship sail.

784
01:15:35,739 --> 01:15:36,739
Oh, here we go.

785
01:15:36,739 --> 01:15:38,369
Here's like a, this will help us.

786
01:15:38,369 --> 01:15:42,300
All right.

787
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:43,300
I got it.

788
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:44,300
Cheating.

789
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:49,060
Um, how is learning cheating?

790
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:51,899
How would I, why would I ever know this information?

791
01:15:51,899 --> 01:15:53,520
You want me to walk down the path and find what all these are named?

792
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:54,520
This is just learning.

793
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:55,520
This is learning what these are and then clicking on them.

794
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:57,340
Uh, where's the flying?

795
01:15:57,340 --> 01:15:58,340
There's the flying.

796
01:15:58,340 --> 01:15:59,340
There's the flying.

797
01:15:59,340 --> 01:16:01,220
There's the flying.

798
01:16:01,220 --> 01:16:02,220
There's the flying.

799
01:16:02,220 --> 01:16:03,220
There's the flying.

800
01:16:03,220 --> 01:16:04,220
There's the flying.

801
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:05,220
There's the flying.

802
01:16:05,819 --> 01:16:08,579
This is learning what these are and then clicking on them.

803
01:16:08,579 --> 01:16:14,880
Uh, where's the flying?

804
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:15,880
There's the flying jib.

805
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:19,489
It's not even on here.

806
01:16:19,489 --> 01:16:26,420
What about the one underneath?

807
01:16:26,420 --> 01:16:29,500
The four moon sail is this one.

808
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:36,140
Do they have different names for everything?

809
01:16:36,140 --> 01:16:40,130
This is supposed to be the four moon sail.

810
01:16:40,130 --> 01:16:47,600
Four stay sail.

811
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:50,550
This is the wrong sheet.

812
01:16:50,550 --> 01:16:54,000
This thing's called the spanker.

813
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,319
Uh, incorrect apparently.

814
01:16:57,319 --> 01:16:58,319
Parts of a ship.

815
01:16:58,359 --> 01:17:05,340
What about this one?

816
01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:07,300
The main mast is the one in the middle.

817
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:09,439
Okay.

818
01:17:09,439 --> 01:17:27,159
So this is main mast, main top sail, uh, main top galant stay sail, main royal sail, main

819
01:17:27,159 --> 01:17:28,159
sail.

820
01:17:28,159 --> 01:17:33,300
Okay.

821
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:40,380
The four mast is the one, so this is the, there's too many parts here.

822
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:43,060
He doesn't know.

823
01:17:43,060 --> 01:17:49,939
Even with a, I have a cheat sheet right next to me and it's still confusing me.

824
01:17:49,939 --> 01:17:51,979
Because people call these different things.

825
01:17:51,979 --> 01:17:54,880
Somebody said this is the beak.

826
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:56,479
This is the spanker on one list.

827
01:17:56,479 --> 01:18:04,180
All right.

828
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:05,180
Here we go.

829
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:10,069
He looks, this looks like a good one.

830
01:18:10,069 --> 01:18:11,069
Main mat crows now.

831
01:18:11,069 --> 01:18:12,069
Okay.

832
01:18:12,069 --> 01:18:14,659
Shrouds of the officers.

833
01:18:14,659 --> 01:18:22,699
No, this is like the four top galant sail.

834
01:18:22,699 --> 01:18:30,000
This is too many sails.

835
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,800
Why there's too many?

836
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:32,800
What is this thing?

837
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:38,939
This is, they're just floating.

838
01:18:38,939 --> 01:18:44,560
Uh, I can't even cheat.

839
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:50,500
I can't cheat because these are all these images of like different from each other.

840
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:54,500
Every single one of these is different to the next one because some of them only have

841
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:58,100
one or two masts.

842
01:18:58,100 --> 01:18:59,100
I can't cheat.

843
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:00,909
Holy fuck.

844
01:19:00,909 --> 01:19:01,909
Wait a minute.

845
01:19:01,909 --> 01:19:08,149
Is this actually, is this from the game?

846
01:19:08,149 --> 01:19:10,800
I think this is from the game.

847
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:22,010
I just typed in like parts of a ship.

848
01:19:22,010 --> 01:19:26,260
I'm going to type in force for sale for sale.

849
01:19:26,260 --> 01:19:30,710
Um, I, do you think I'm going to sit there and look at all that shit?

850
01:19:30,710 --> 01:19:34,579
They're all so different.

851
01:19:34,579 --> 01:19:39,369
For Royal, the eggplant sale?

852
01:19:39,369 --> 01:19:40,369
What?

853
01:19:40,369 --> 01:19:41,369
I'm putting this on screen.

854
01:19:41,369 --> 01:19:57,859
This thing, seafaring, captains and shit have different names for everything.

855
01:19:57,859 --> 01:19:58,859
Let's go over this.

856
01:19:58,859 --> 01:19:59,859
Help me.

857
01:19:59,859 --> 01:20:22,920
What, what, what, what, what am I looking at here?

858
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:23,920
Okay.

859
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:31,260
So see that that's the four moon sail.

860
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:38,699
The mizzen is the back mizzen moon sail.

861
01:20:38,699 --> 01:20:43,109
There's the stay sale.

862
01:20:43,109 --> 01:20:46,470
He's don't even mizzen top sale.

863
01:20:46,470 --> 01:20:47,470
There's only two.

864
01:20:47,470 --> 01:21:09,060
No, I can't even read this mizzen.

865
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:10,060
Click my link.

866
01:21:10,060 --> 01:21:15,649
What the fuck is that?

867
01:21:15,649 --> 01:21:19,500
That's a lot of, but mizzen Royal's not even on here.

868
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:20,500
Mizzen sky sale.

869
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:26,479
All right.

870
01:21:26,479 --> 01:21:28,920
The ones that mizzen are in the back.

871
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:29,920
Okay.

872
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:30,920
Okay.

873
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:31,920
Mizzen top sale.

874
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:32,920
I don't know this one.

875
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:33,920
Mizzen stay sale.

876
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:35,739
This one.

877
01:21:35,739 --> 01:21:42,079
Top glance sale.

878
01:21:42,079 --> 01:21:47,279
Use this one.

879
01:21:47,279 --> 01:21:48,279
I'm trying to click it.

880
01:21:48,279 --> 01:21:49,279
It's going too fast.

881
01:21:49,279 --> 01:21:53,850
That's not, that's not even what this is.

882
01:21:53,850 --> 01:21:54,850
Game boomers.

883
01:21:54,850 --> 01:21:55,850
What is game boomers?

884
01:21:55,850 --> 01:21:56,850
All right.

885
01:21:56,850 --> 01:22:02,460
Did you just give me the actual solution?

886
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:03,460
Is this the solution?

887
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:27,710
A, E, K, B, A, E, K, I had K, correct, K, B, H, O, F, N, D, J.

888
01:22:28,710 --> 01:22:44,140
Uh, M, C, I, M, C, I, well, hold on.

889
01:22:44,140 --> 01:22:47,539
I'm not spelling out something fucked up, right?

890
01:22:47,539 --> 01:22:48,539
Okay.

891
01:22:48,539 --> 01:22:49,539
I'm not.

892
01:22:49,539 --> 01:22:52,100
I just, somebody just linked me like an, like an imgur link of, or I don't, I don't know

893
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:55,220
why I just figured maybe they would like making me spell something fucking crazy.

894
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:56,220
Okay.

895
01:22:56,220 --> 01:23:06,489
And the last two are L, G. Learn to speak like a sailor.

896
01:23:07,489 --> 01:23:16,439
Rear or towards the stern, front or towards the bow, port, parts of the average ship's

897
01:23:16,439 --> 01:23:22,600
bow spirit to David, forecastle gaff.

898
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:26,680
Didn't like a boat crash into a wall and aren't we, is it, wasn't it like a murder

899
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:27,680
or something?

900
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:33,590
Why do we have to do this?

901
01:23:33,590 --> 01:23:34,590
That's all this was for.

902
01:23:34,590 --> 01:23:38,779
That's it.

903
01:23:38,779 --> 01:23:43,090
Maybe later.

904
01:23:43,090 --> 01:23:46,470
Complimentary gift wrap available.

905
01:23:46,470 --> 01:23:47,470
Gift wrap on gasoline.

906
01:23:47,470 --> 01:23:48,470
All right.

907
01:23:48,470 --> 01:23:49,470
Let's talk.

908
01:23:49,470 --> 01:23:50,470
Hi there.

909
01:23:50,470 --> 01:23:51,470
My name is Soren.

910
01:23:51,470 --> 01:23:52,710
You must be Nancy.

911
01:23:52,710 --> 01:23:55,550
I'm Soren, the organizer of the Ancestors Festival.

912
01:23:55,550 --> 01:23:58,029
I run the culture center here in Skiprock.

913
01:23:58,029 --> 01:23:59,029
Nice to meet you.

914
01:23:59,029 --> 01:24:00,029
Can you help me get onto the ship?

915
01:24:00,029 --> 01:24:01,029
Ah, you're in the laundry room?

916
01:24:01,029 --> 01:24:02,029
Is Elizabeth not manning the gangway?

917
01:24:02,029 --> 01:24:03,029
The gangway is missing, unfortunately.

918
01:24:03,029 --> 01:24:04,029
Oh dear.

919
01:24:04,029 --> 01:24:05,029
Well, that's highly unusual.

920
01:24:05,029 --> 01:24:06,029
I'll take care of it straight away for you.

921
01:24:06,029 --> 01:24:07,029
No accent?

922
01:24:07,029 --> 01:24:08,029
Rose, truly.

923
01:24:08,029 --> 01:24:09,029
But she does have thorns.

924
01:24:09,029 --> 01:24:10,029
Hey, what do you think happened to Magnus?

925
01:24:10,029 --> 01:24:11,029
What do you think happened to Magnus?

926
01:24:11,029 --> 01:24:24,130
I admit I haven't the faintest idea.

927
01:24:24,130 --> 01:24:28,930
That man's mind is a hive of mysteries, an enigma, an impenetrable den.

928
01:24:28,930 --> 01:24:30,930
So you two never really talked?

929
01:24:30,930 --> 01:24:31,930
This dude's sweater.

930
01:24:31,930 --> 01:24:32,930
An understatement.

931
01:24:32,930 --> 01:24:33,930
I want a nice hot coffee right now.

932
01:24:33,930 --> 01:24:36,930
The man hardly spoke 10 words to me the entire time I knew him.

933
01:24:36,930 --> 01:24:37,930
I do hope he's all right.

934
01:24:37,930 --> 01:24:38,930
I don't know why.

935
01:24:38,930 --> 01:24:39,930
It's getting an automatic response from me.

936
01:24:40,649 --> 01:24:43,649
I want like a nice hot latte.

937
01:24:43,649 --> 01:24:44,649
I don't...

938
01:24:44,649 --> 01:24:45,649
I just want it.

939
01:24:45,649 --> 01:24:46,649
I'm already disliked.

940
01:24:46,649 --> 01:24:50,270
And it would only show the others how easy it is to make someone disappear.

941
01:24:50,270 --> 01:24:52,270
What is this place?

942
01:24:52,270 --> 01:24:54,350
This is my battle station.

943
01:24:54,350 --> 01:24:58,829
The place where I endeavor to fight my way through the thickest mysteries of Icelandic

944
01:24:58,829 --> 01:24:59,829
history.

945
01:24:59,829 --> 01:25:04,949
Here, confusing ancient shipwrecks and obscure writings from millennia past are converted

946
01:25:04,949 --> 01:25:05,949
into knowledge and truths.

947
01:25:05,949 --> 01:25:06,949
This is my battle station.

948
01:25:06,949 --> 01:25:07,949
Also, I have swords.

949
01:25:08,350 --> 01:25:11,350
Take a look at how many monitors I have over here.

950
01:25:11,350 --> 01:25:16,949
So, you're a historian, archaeologist, a bit of both?

951
01:25:16,949 --> 01:25:17,949
I dabble.

952
01:25:17,949 --> 01:25:22,069
I spent some years at Harvard pursuing my doctorate in Viking history before returning

953
01:25:22,069 --> 01:25:23,710
to Skipporad for research.

954
01:25:23,710 --> 01:25:26,550
I'm one of the only few to ever travel in this town.

955
01:25:26,550 --> 01:25:28,109
Everyone here should try it sometime.

956
01:25:28,109 --> 01:25:30,430
Really shakes up the old bag of prejudices.

957
01:25:30,430 --> 01:25:32,550
I guess that explains why you don't have much of an accent.

958
01:25:32,550 --> 01:25:34,949
Check out my washing machine collection.

959
01:25:37,020 --> 01:25:39,819
You know, there's people that collect everything.

960
01:25:39,819 --> 01:25:45,560
If you don't think that somebody has a basement full of washing machines and dryers, there

961
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:46,560
definitely is.

962
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:51,000
In fact, if there's somebody that collects it, that means that there's probably a convention

963
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,810
for that too.

964
01:25:52,810 --> 01:25:54,510
I guarantee it.

965
01:25:54,510 --> 01:26:00,149
If you typed in vintage washing machine convention, you'll find something.

966
01:26:00,149 --> 01:26:06,170
Alright, what are you researching?

967
01:26:13,170 --> 01:26:15,170
Wash-con.

968
01:26:27,170 --> 01:26:29,170
Did you do it?

969
01:26:37,170 --> 01:26:39,170
Oh, you lost me.

970
01:26:39,170 --> 01:26:41,170
You lost me real quick.

971
01:26:42,170 --> 01:26:43,170
Cool.

972
01:26:43,170 --> 01:26:44,170
Cool swords.

973
01:26:44,170 --> 01:26:45,170
Bye.

974
01:26:45,170 --> 01:26:50,670
What do you think about this sword?

975
01:26:50,670 --> 01:26:52,670
I could use a little space, Nancy.

976
01:26:52,670 --> 01:26:56,220
Alright.

977
01:26:56,220 --> 01:27:03,819
Uh, nothing over here.

978
01:27:03,819 --> 01:27:05,819
Wait, what's this?

979
01:27:05,819 --> 01:27:09,399
Uh, the sextant.

980
01:27:09,399 --> 01:27:14,399
Navigational instrument which allowed sailors to determine latitude, the astrolabe, the

981
01:27:14,399 --> 01:27:17,399
sunstone, the fishing reel, the cargo lantern.

982
01:27:17,399 --> 01:27:18,399
There's a lot about boats.

983
01:27:18,399 --> 01:27:20,399
There's a lot of things about boats here.

984
01:27:20,399 --> 01:27:22,979
Do I have a...

985
01:27:22,979 --> 01:27:26,819
Oh, my cell phone!

986
01:27:26,819 --> 01:27:28,960
Settings.

987
01:27:32,420 --> 01:27:34,850
Why would you want this as your background?

988
01:27:34,850 --> 01:27:36,850
Is it bear traps and meat hook and shit?

989
01:27:36,850 --> 01:27:38,850
That's kind of creepy.

990
01:27:41,020 --> 01:27:43,020
Oh, I like the crystals.

991
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:44,020
Ringtone.

992
01:27:46,260 --> 01:27:51,979
What?

993
01:27:58,899 --> 01:27:59,899
What's comedy?

994
01:28:00,899 --> 01:28:05,000
That's a comedy.

995
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
I don't know.

996
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,560
That's pretty funny.

997
01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:15,680
Alright, I'm going to do the Yoshi sound.

998
01:28:18,140 --> 01:28:19,140
Ringtone.

999
01:28:19,140 --> 01:28:25,789
Oh, that one's real.

1000
01:28:25,789 --> 01:28:28,930
Why is it called Oregon?

1001
01:28:28,930 --> 01:28:36,350
Should I do the burps?

1002
01:28:36,350 --> 01:28:39,939
Alright, that's pretty good.

1003
01:28:40,939 --> 01:28:42,939
Definitely the scratch one, okay.

1004
01:28:42,939 --> 01:28:44,819
What about my photos?

1005
01:28:44,819 --> 01:28:47,180
View galleries.

1006
01:28:47,180 --> 01:28:50,960
No photos?

1007
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:55,479
Okay, what about, um, my diary?

1008
01:28:55,479 --> 01:28:57,479
I'm not writing it down.

1009
01:28:57,479 --> 01:28:58,479
Phone.

1010
01:28:58,479 --> 01:29:00,479
Oh, it's Ned!

1011
01:29:00,479 --> 01:29:02,479
I can call Ned with this.

1012
01:29:11,210 --> 01:29:13,210
One, because this number doesn't exist.

1013
01:29:13,210 --> 01:29:15,210
For everyone else, leave a message.

1014
01:29:22,140 --> 01:29:24,770
I just really pissed that person off.

1015
01:29:24,770 --> 01:29:26,710
Because they just got...

1016
01:29:26,710 --> 01:29:27,710
Yo, you have a new voicemail!

1017
01:29:27,710 --> 01:29:31,300
Oh, let me listen.

1018
01:29:31,300 --> 01:29:32,300
I wonder what it is.

1019
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:34,300
Why is it only four and a half seconds long?

1020
01:29:34,300 --> 01:29:35,979
Oh, it's just this.

1021
01:29:35,979 --> 01:29:37,979
It's like swishing pants.

1022
01:29:37,979 --> 01:29:38,979
And the hang up noise.

1023
01:29:38,979 --> 01:29:39,979
Okay, cool.

1024
01:29:39,979 --> 01:29:50,659
Alright, get this down.

1025
01:29:51,659 --> 01:29:53,659
The game wanted me to go to sleep.

1026
01:29:53,659 --> 01:29:55,659
What was this?

1027
01:29:55,659 --> 01:29:56,659
One, two, three?

1028
01:29:56,659 --> 01:30:00,800
Could you finish setting up the knots display?

1029
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:04,800
You just need to match the images to the knot they create.

1030
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:07,800
I do it myself, but I don't have the time.

1031
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:08,800
I don't...

1032
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:10,800
I have no idea what you're asking me to do.

1033
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:14,800
Put the knots next to the knots that they create?

1034
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:22,840
Put the knots next to the knots they make?

1035
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:27,369
Uh, this is...

1036
01:30:27,369 --> 01:30:28,369
Is that...

1037
01:30:28,369 --> 01:30:30,369
Is this correct, right?

1038
01:30:30,369 --> 01:30:34,949
Wait, there's five steps for each knot.

1039
01:30:34,949 --> 01:30:39,300
Oh my god.

1040
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:41,300
I don't know how to do these.

1041
01:30:41,300 --> 01:30:44,930
I don't know any of this stuff.

1042
01:30:44,930 --> 01:30:50,430
I don't know how to do this.

1043
01:30:50,430 --> 01:30:52,430
It's not this one.

1044
01:30:52,430 --> 01:31:00,460
So we got, okay, one big loop.

1045
01:31:00,460 --> 01:31:01,460
And then...

1046
01:31:01,460 --> 01:31:04,909
I mean, that's like, this is done.

1047
01:31:04,909 --> 01:31:06,090
No, it's not.

1048
01:31:06,090 --> 01:31:09,760
What?

1049
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:10,760
I gotta get...

1050
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:14,819
I gotta spread them out a little.

1051
01:31:14,819 --> 01:31:18,340
Go get string and do it.

1052
01:31:18,340 --> 01:31:19,340
Am I dumb?

1053
01:31:19,340 --> 01:31:20,340
No, I...

1054
01:31:20,340 --> 01:31:23,369
Alright.

1055
01:31:23,369 --> 01:31:24,369
Chat.

1056
01:31:24,369 --> 01:31:25,369
Chat.

1057
01:31:25,369 --> 01:31:26,369
Excuse me.

1058
01:31:26,369 --> 01:31:34,130
When was the last time any of you made this knot?

1059
01:31:34,130 --> 01:31:36,130
If you ever made that knot.

1060
01:31:36,130 --> 01:31:37,689
Ever.

1061
01:31:37,689 --> 01:31:39,689
And I'm talking for any reason.

1062
01:31:39,689 --> 01:31:42,380
Nobody has made these knots.

1063
01:31:42,380 --> 01:31:44,380
Maybe one of you have done this.

1064
01:31:44,380 --> 01:31:52,100
I can't believe you just know how to make a...

1065
01:31:52,100 --> 01:31:54,100
I can't even give you a fake name

1066
01:31:54,100 --> 01:31:56,100
because I don't even know what these could be called.

1067
01:31:56,100 --> 01:31:57,100
The pretzel knot.

1068
01:31:57,100 --> 01:31:58,100
I don't know.

1069
01:31:58,100 --> 01:32:01,579
This isn't even a knot.

1070
01:32:01,579 --> 01:32:04,579
This is just what happens to my fucking earpods.

1071
01:32:04,579 --> 01:32:05,579
That's your...

1072
01:32:05,579 --> 01:32:06,579
That's a headphone.

1073
01:32:06,579 --> 01:32:09,140
That's a headphone every day.

1074
01:32:09,140 --> 01:32:10,140
Is that done?

1075
01:32:10,140 --> 01:32:19,060
Did I do it?

1076
01:32:19,060 --> 01:32:22,979
No, this one goes up here.

1077
01:32:22,979 --> 01:32:24,979
I think this one goes down here.

1078
01:32:24,979 --> 01:32:27,859
I gotta get them all out so I can look at them.

1079
01:32:27,859 --> 01:32:31,279
Are there any baits?

1080
01:32:31,279 --> 01:32:33,279
Okay, there are no baits.

1081
01:32:33,279 --> 01:32:40,149
Alright, we need to get the two big ones.

1082
01:32:40,149 --> 01:32:41,149
There you go.

1083
01:32:41,149 --> 01:32:43,220
Okay.

1084
01:32:43,220 --> 01:32:44,220
Looking good.

1085
01:32:44,220 --> 01:32:50,239
Alright, looking good.

1086
01:32:50,239 --> 01:32:58,710
This one's done.

1087
01:32:58,710 --> 01:33:02,739
We're gonna need a game boomer here.

1088
01:33:02,739 --> 01:33:06,619
Now, this one, this is the fat loop.

1089
01:33:06,619 --> 01:33:09,119
So this requires a big loop.

1090
01:33:09,119 --> 01:33:11,119
This one has a small loop.

1091
01:33:11,119 --> 01:33:13,119
This one can come down here.

1092
01:33:13,119 --> 01:33:14,119
I think we're gonna be good here.

1093
01:33:14,119 --> 01:33:16,119
I need to have the finishing product.

1094
01:33:16,119 --> 01:33:19,119
This is the finished product of this one.

1095
01:33:19,119 --> 01:33:25,560
This looks like a pretty...

1096
01:33:25,560 --> 01:33:26,560
Um...

1097
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:29,699
Literally no.

1098
01:33:29,699 --> 01:33:33,020
I kinda wanna make one of these.

1099
01:33:33,020 --> 01:33:36,250
Yo.

1100
01:33:36,250 --> 01:33:37,250
Fuck it.

1101
01:33:37,250 --> 01:33:38,250
I'll be right back.

1102
01:33:38,250 --> 01:35:30,659
Alright, let's give it a try.

1103
01:35:30,659 --> 01:35:32,960
See if I can do this.

1104
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:37,909
So, we've got...

1105
01:35:37,909 --> 01:35:42,199
Let me see if I can do the middle one.

1106
01:35:42,199 --> 01:35:45,850
Yeah, I don't know if these are shoelaces

1107
01:35:45,850 --> 01:35:49,850
or if these are strings that go inside of hoodies or pants.

1108
01:35:49,850 --> 01:35:51,979
I found them.

1109
01:35:51,979 --> 01:35:55,569
Alright, let's get the cam on.

1110
01:35:55,569 --> 01:36:11,229
Is this drawstring?

1111
01:36:11,229 --> 01:36:13,229
Yeah, I think it is just drawstrings.

1112
01:36:13,229 --> 01:36:16,369
It's just pants.

1113
01:36:16,369 --> 01:36:22,000
Why does this keep happening?

1114
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:28,720
I keep having it so shrunken.

1115
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:31,600
No, it's gotta be this way.

1116
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:34,420
There's the Xbox.

1117
01:36:34,420 --> 01:36:38,409
There we go.

1118
01:36:38,409 --> 01:36:39,409
Okay, right there.

1119
01:36:39,409 --> 01:36:44,270
See if I can do it.

1120
01:36:44,270 --> 01:36:51,850
So, we're looking...

1121
01:36:51,850 --> 01:36:52,850
So, we got...

1122
01:36:52,850 --> 01:36:54,850
Here's our string.

1123
01:36:54,850 --> 01:36:57,090
You need two strings, right?

1124
01:36:57,090 --> 01:37:06,750
So, you take the two ends like this.

1125
01:37:06,750 --> 01:37:17,890
How far up does this need to be?

1126
01:37:17,890 --> 01:37:27,779
Just needs to go wrap around like how many times?

1127
01:37:27,779 --> 01:37:31,899
Twice?

1128
01:37:31,899 --> 01:37:32,899
So, like...

1129
01:37:32,899 --> 01:37:34,210
Hold on a minute.

1130
01:37:34,210 --> 01:37:35,210
This is...

1131
01:37:35,210 --> 01:37:40,329
You go over and...

1132
01:37:40,329 --> 01:37:41,329
Hold on.

1133
01:37:41,329 --> 01:37:43,329
Am I supposed to be doing it like this?

1134
01:37:43,329 --> 01:37:47,260
Over?

1135
01:37:47,260 --> 01:37:53,590
Like that again?

1136
01:37:53,590 --> 01:37:57,619
Okay, like that.

1137
01:37:57,619 --> 01:38:02,920
Then, you...

1138
01:38:02,920 --> 01:38:12,159
These are too...

1139
01:38:12,159 --> 01:38:14,159
Look at how long these are!

1140
01:38:14,159 --> 01:38:16,159
These are so long!

1141
01:38:16,159 --> 01:38:32,439
I need like three people to do this.

1142
01:38:32,439 --> 01:38:39,159
Over, under, like that.

1143
01:38:39,159 --> 01:38:41,159
Okay, that part's done.

1144
01:38:41,159 --> 01:38:43,159
And then we go like this.

1145
01:38:43,159 --> 01:38:46,159
I need like a person to hold on to this shit.

1146
01:38:46,159 --> 01:38:48,550
Like this.

1147
01:38:48,550 --> 01:38:56,300
And then, from here, I go...

1148
01:38:56,300 --> 01:38:58,560
What the fuck do you want me to do here?

1149
01:38:58,560 --> 01:38:59,560
Again?

1150
01:38:59,560 --> 01:39:01,560
Over, under, again?

1151
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:03,630
Like that?

1152
01:39:03,630 --> 01:39:05,829
Oh, dude!

1153
01:39:05,829 --> 01:39:06,829
Pogchamp!

1154
01:39:06,829 --> 01:39:07,829
I got it.

1155
01:39:07,829 --> 01:39:14,090
What the fuck, dude?

1156
01:39:14,090 --> 01:39:15,090
Are you serious?

1157
01:39:15,090 --> 01:39:24,010
How am I gonna do...

1158
01:39:24,010 --> 01:39:25,010
Oh, God.

1159
01:39:25,010 --> 01:39:27,010
I'm not gonna be able to do these next ones.

1160
01:39:27,010 --> 01:39:28,630
This next one is just...

1161
01:39:28,630 --> 01:39:29,630
Okay.

1162
01:39:29,630 --> 01:39:30,630
Now, I don't need the second one.

1163
01:39:30,630 --> 01:39:31,630
What does this say?

1164
01:39:31,630 --> 01:39:32,630
Do what?

1165
01:39:32,630 --> 01:39:34,899
Do...

1166
01:39:34,899 --> 01:39:35,899
Do...

1167
01:39:35,899 --> 01:39:36,899
Do laundry.

1168
01:39:36,899 --> 01:39:38,579
Okay, I gotta remember that.

1169
01:39:38,579 --> 01:39:39,579
All right, these...

1170
01:39:39,579 --> 01:39:43,260
I gotta fix these ones.

1171
01:39:43,260 --> 01:39:45,260
I didn't want to do it afterwards.

1172
01:39:45,260 --> 01:39:46,260
Okay.

1173
01:39:46,260 --> 01:39:49,029
All right, so...

1174
01:39:49,029 --> 01:39:50,029
I...

1175
01:39:50,029 --> 01:39:51,029
How does this one even work?

1176
01:39:51,029 --> 01:39:55,729
How does this one even work?

1177
01:39:55,729 --> 01:39:56,729
Is there something wrong?

1178
01:39:56,729 --> 01:39:57,729
I don't know.

1179
01:39:57,729 --> 01:40:03,979
Around, and then through that loop, so that's correct.

1180
01:40:03,979 --> 01:40:11,409
And then, once you get to up here, you go around, underneath, and then through, and

1181
01:40:11,409 --> 01:40:12,409
then that's it.

1182
01:40:12,409 --> 01:40:13,710
Is that right?

1183
01:40:13,710 --> 01:40:18,279
No.

1184
01:40:18,279 --> 01:40:19,279
This is...

1185
01:40:19,279 --> 01:40:20,279
This is for the one up there.

1186
01:40:20,279 --> 01:40:22,279
This is for the one up.

1187
01:40:22,279 --> 01:40:28,180
That starts there, and then it goes up, around, and then...

1188
01:40:28,180 --> 01:40:29,180
Let me do it.

1189
01:40:29,180 --> 01:40:30,180
Let me do it.

1190
01:40:30,180 --> 01:40:32,449
Let me do it.

1191
01:40:32,449 --> 01:40:33,449
Switch top, left, and bottom left.

1192
01:40:34,449 --> 01:40:43,470
No, that's not correct, because this has to go up through that hoop.

1193
01:40:43,470 --> 01:40:47,020
Uh...

1194
01:40:47,020 --> 01:40:52,409
From there, you go under, and then you wrap around, and then you...

1195
01:40:52,409 --> 01:40:55,699
Like that?

1196
01:40:55,699 --> 01:40:56,699
Yeah, like that.

1197
01:40:56,699 --> 01:40:58,000
But that's...

1198
01:40:58,000 --> 01:40:59,000
That's the...

1199
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,000
That's this one.

1200
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:05,909
Got it.

1201
01:41:05,909 --> 01:41:10,420
Okay.

1202
01:41:10,420 --> 01:41:11,420
Now, let's try...

1203
01:41:11,420 --> 01:41:12,420
Let's try that one.

1204
01:41:12,420 --> 01:41:13,420
This actually...

1205
01:41:13,420 --> 01:41:14,420
Kind of fun.

1206
01:41:14,420 --> 01:41:16,550
I like this.

1207
01:41:16,550 --> 01:41:17,550
All right, so then we start.

1208
01:41:17,550 --> 01:41:19,819
Uh, this is too long.

1209
01:41:19,819 --> 01:41:20,819
It's too long.

1210
01:41:20,819 --> 01:41:21,819
I can't do it.

1211
01:41:21,819 --> 01:41:22,819
I can't do it.

1212
01:41:22,819 --> 01:41:25,020
It's too long.

1213
01:41:28,369 --> 01:41:36,500
And then this has to go...

1214
01:41:36,500 --> 01:41:42,899
Make like a circle around and under.

1215
01:41:42,899 --> 01:41:43,899
Like that.

1216
01:41:43,899 --> 01:41:47,640
Right?

1217
01:41:47,640 --> 01:41:48,640
Get...

1218
01:41:48,640 --> 01:41:51,859
Okay.

1219
01:41:51,859 --> 01:41:56,899
It's too long.

1220
01:41:56,899 --> 01:41:57,899
This is way too long.

1221
01:41:57,899 --> 01:42:00,590
And then this one goes...

1222
01:42:00,590 --> 01:42:01,590
Uh...

1223
01:42:01,590 --> 01:42:05,659
Through the hoop here, over.

1224
01:42:05,659 --> 01:42:06,659
Like that.

1225
01:42:06,659 --> 01:42:11,550
And then under, and then over.

1226
01:42:11,550 --> 01:42:14,550
This one needs to be much smaller, but this one's going to be a little bigger.

1227
01:42:14,550 --> 01:42:16,109
Uh...

1228
01:42:16,109 --> 01:42:17,109
Wait.

1229
01:42:17,109 --> 01:42:22,449
Hold on.

1230
01:42:22,449 --> 01:42:23,449
Fuck.

1231
01:42:23,449 --> 01:42:25,069
No, that's okay.

1232
01:42:25,069 --> 01:42:28,069
So then this one goes underneath this one.

1233
01:42:28,069 --> 01:42:32,399
And then it wraps back down through...

1234
01:42:32,399 --> 01:42:35,829
Over there, through here, under.

1235
01:42:35,829 --> 01:42:36,829
And then you pull it.

1236
01:42:36,829 --> 01:42:47,859
Did I get it?

1237
01:42:47,859 --> 01:42:50,260
I got it.

1238
01:42:50,260 --> 01:42:56,100
Yeah, that's perfect.

1239
01:42:56,100 --> 01:43:02,720
Doesn't feel very secure, though.

1240
01:43:02,720 --> 01:43:03,720
Nice.

1241
01:43:03,720 --> 01:43:16,159
I can't...

1242
01:43:16,159 --> 01:43:17,159
There we go.

1243
01:43:17,159 --> 01:43:18,159
There we go.

1244
01:43:18,159 --> 01:43:19,159
All right.

1245
01:43:19,159 --> 01:43:20,159
What's the last one?

1246
01:43:20,159 --> 01:43:22,159
I've got to get it right.

1247
01:43:22,159 --> 01:43:24,159
Last one is...

1248
01:43:24,159 --> 01:43:25,159
Start there.

1249
01:43:25,159 --> 01:43:28,529
I want to just do this.

1250
01:43:28,529 --> 01:43:31,149
I want to just make nuts.

1251
01:43:31,149 --> 01:43:32,149
Is that fucking stupid?

1252
01:43:32,149 --> 01:43:35,100
I wanted to do this.

1253
01:43:35,100 --> 01:43:37,100
Okay, so then wrap it around there.

1254
01:43:37,100 --> 01:43:38,100
Then that...

1255
01:43:38,100 --> 01:43:39,100
Oh, shit.

1256
01:43:39,100 --> 01:43:40,100
No, no, no.

1257
01:43:40,100 --> 01:43:41,100
Don't leave the screen.

1258
01:43:41,100 --> 01:43:42,100
Don't leave the screen.

1259
01:43:42,100 --> 01:43:43,100
Don't leave the screen.

1260
01:43:43,100 --> 01:43:50,029
I want to see that.

1261
01:43:50,029 --> 01:43:53,060
Oh, god damn it.

1262
01:43:53,060 --> 01:43:54,060
I can't see.

1263
01:43:54,060 --> 01:43:55,060
Shit.

1264
01:43:55,060 --> 01:43:56,060
Uh...

1265
01:43:56,060 --> 01:43:57,060
It's all right.

1266
01:43:57,060 --> 01:44:00,859
I can kind of see it.

1267
01:44:00,859 --> 01:44:01,859
Click on it again?

1268
01:44:01,859 --> 01:44:02,859
I can't.

1269
01:44:02,859 --> 01:44:04,739
I can see it.

1270
01:44:04,739 --> 01:44:06,739
You just simply wrap it around like that.

1271
01:44:06,739 --> 01:44:09,390
Like that.

1272
01:44:09,390 --> 01:44:10,390
Okay.

1273
01:44:10,390 --> 01:44:12,140
And then this...

1274
01:44:12,140 --> 01:44:13,140
What does it do?

1275
01:44:13,140 --> 01:44:22,300
It goes under and then over, like, right there, immediately.

1276
01:44:22,300 --> 01:44:25,060
And then I can't see.

1277
01:44:25,060 --> 01:44:34,899
And then I can't see.

1278
01:44:34,899 --> 01:44:38,159
Let me make it bigger so I can see it.

1279
01:44:38,159 --> 01:44:44,880
This is insanely important to me, so I can't click on it anymore.

1280
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:54,199
So let me do this again.

1281
01:44:54,199 --> 01:44:55,199
Reset.

1282
01:44:55,199 --> 01:44:59,899
It's just...

1283
01:44:59,899 --> 01:45:00,899
This one has to be longer.

1284
01:45:00,899 --> 01:45:02,329
So like that.

1285
01:45:02,329 --> 01:45:05,819
And then it wraps back around.

1286
01:45:05,819 --> 01:45:18,920
So under, under, and then over, immediately right here, like that.

1287
01:45:18,920 --> 01:45:33,460
And then you go back under and through the loop, like this, and then out across to here.

1288
01:45:33,460 --> 01:45:42,500
And then that shit goes all the way around and then under itself.

1289
01:45:42,500 --> 01:45:43,500
Like that.

1290
01:45:43,500 --> 01:45:45,449
And then tighten it.

1291
01:45:45,449 --> 01:45:49,439
Did I do it?

1292
01:45:49,439 --> 01:45:58,359
Did I get it?

1293
01:45:58,359 --> 01:46:02,800
Okay.

1294
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:08,710
No, I got it.

1295
01:46:08,710 --> 01:46:09,710
That was correct.

1296
01:46:09,710 --> 01:46:13,510
Nice.

1297
01:46:13,510 --> 01:46:15,140
Somebody give me, give me, give me another knot to do.

1298
01:46:15,140 --> 01:46:16,140
I want to do another knot.

1299
01:46:16,140 --> 01:46:18,340
Anybody have one more I can do?

1300
01:46:18,340 --> 01:46:19,340
You're a serial killer.

1301
01:46:19,340 --> 01:46:20,340
What?

1302
01:46:20,340 --> 01:46:25,479
Fun knots to do.

1303
01:46:25,479 --> 01:46:30,109
Ooh, essential knots.

1304
01:46:30,109 --> 01:46:31,109
How to tie 20 knots.

1305
01:46:31,109 --> 01:46:32,109
Why is doing knots a serial killer?

1306
01:46:32,109 --> 01:46:33,479
Okay, cool.

1307
01:46:33,479 --> 01:46:34,720
We did the square knot.

1308
01:46:34,720 --> 01:46:35,720
Okay, what about the bow?

1309
01:46:35,720 --> 01:46:38,750
We did the bow line.

1310
01:46:38,750 --> 01:47:01,449
The figure 8, the street, the sheet bend, two half hitches, taut hitch line, fisherman's

1311
01:47:01,449 --> 01:47:02,449
knot.

1312
01:47:02,449 --> 01:47:03,449
Look at this one.

1313
01:47:03,449 --> 01:47:04,939
Let me try this one just by hand.

1314
01:47:04,939 --> 01:47:05,939
Check this one out.

1315
01:47:05,939 --> 01:47:11,979
This one's fucked up.

1316
01:47:11,979 --> 01:47:12,979
Look at how crazy this one is.

1317
01:47:12,979 --> 01:47:20,010
See if I can do it.

1318
01:47:20,010 --> 01:47:22,010
Let's not be in the gem watch.

1319
01:47:22,010 --> 01:47:29,140
Look at this thing.

1320
01:47:29,140 --> 01:47:31,659
Cool.

1321
01:47:31,659 --> 01:47:39,550
Let me try it.

1322
01:47:39,550 --> 01:47:40,550
Okay, let's get some music here.

1323
01:47:40,550 --> 01:47:50,619
Let's try it.

1324
01:47:50,619 --> 01:47:56,220
So it looks like it's a small circle here.

1325
01:47:56,220 --> 01:47:57,710
Cool.

1326
01:47:57,710 --> 01:47:58,710
Like that.

1327
01:47:58,710 --> 01:47:59,710
And then it goes underneath itself like this.

1328
01:47:59,710 --> 01:48:00,710
Actually underneath like three or four times.

1329
01:48:00,710 --> 01:48:02,380
Make it a little bit bigger though.

1330
01:48:02,380 --> 01:48:03,380
Ow, ow.

1331
01:48:03,380 --> 01:48:04,380
Um.

1332
01:48:04,380 --> 01:48:06,069
Um.

1333
01:48:06,069 --> 01:48:07,380
Okay.

1334
01:48:07,380 --> 01:48:08,380
This is breaking my finger.

1335
01:48:08,380 --> 01:48:09,380
It's breaking my finger.

1336
01:48:09,380 --> 01:48:20,090
Oh, I hate this.

1337
01:48:20,090 --> 01:48:21,090
I hate this.

1338
01:48:21,090 --> 01:48:23,350
I hate this.

1339
01:48:23,350 --> 01:49:07,220
I hate this.

1340
01:49:07,220 --> 01:49:08,220
I hate this.

1341
01:49:08,220 --> 01:49:09,220
I hate this.

1342
01:49:09,220 --> 01:49:14,170
I hate this.

1343
01:49:14,170 --> 01:49:16,500
I hate this.

1344
01:49:16,500 --> 01:49:18,380
I hate this.

1345
01:49:18,380 --> 01:49:23,199
I hate this.

1346
01:49:23,199 --> 01:49:24,199
I hate this.

1347
01:49:24,199 --> 01:49:25,199
I hate this.

1348
01:49:25,199 --> 01:49:27,460
I hate this.

1349
01:49:27,460 --> 01:49:28,460
I hate this.

1350
01:49:28,460 --> 01:49:29,460
I hate this.

1351
01:49:29,460 --> 01:49:30,460
Hold on.

1352
01:49:30,460 --> 01:49:31,460
Hold on.

1353
01:49:31,460 --> 01:49:32,460
Hold on.

1354
01:49:32,460 --> 01:49:33,640
Hold on.

1355
01:49:33,640 --> 01:49:35,899
I gotta.

1356
01:49:35,899 --> 01:49:36,899
How do you escape?

1357
01:49:36,899 --> 01:49:37,899
How to escape a knot.

1358
01:49:37,899 --> 01:49:42,960
How to escape from?

1359
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:49,319
Please.

1360
01:49:49,319 --> 01:49:50,319
How do I get out of this?

1361
01:49:50,319 --> 01:49:56,039
How do I get out of this?

1362
01:49:56,039 --> 01:49:57,039
How do I get out of this?

1363
01:49:57,039 --> 01:50:00,010
Yeah.

1364
01:50:00,010 --> 01:50:01,010
Presentation.

1365
01:50:01,010 --> 01:50:02,010
Ow.

1366
01:50:02,010 --> 01:50:03,010
Ow.

1367
01:50:03,010 --> 01:50:04,010
Ow.

1368
01:50:04,010 --> 01:50:05,010
Ow.

1369
01:50:05,010 --> 01:50:06,010
How?

1370
01:50:06,010 --> 01:50:07,010
How?

1371
01:50:07,010 --> 01:50:08,010
How?

1372
01:50:08,010 --> 01:50:09,010
How?

1373
01:50:09,010 --> 01:50:10,010
How?

1374
01:50:10,010 --> 01:50:11,010
How?

1375
01:50:11,010 --> 01:50:15,250
Knuckles together and pull my hands out of most of my chest. Oh

1376
01:50:17,609 --> 01:50:20,770
No, no, no, that's wrong way wrong way wrong way

1377
01:50:28,689 --> 01:50:31,369
So that when he ties me up I've created

1378
01:50:32,890 --> 01:50:35,720
That when I breathe oh

1379
01:50:35,720 --> 01:50:47,170
Oh, I just had to let go with my right hand. I was holding it. That was weird. Okay, that'll heal

1380
01:50:47,170 --> 01:50:50,090
I think okay, that'll heal nicely in the next six months

1381
01:50:50,770 --> 01:51:17,489
Okay. Um, that's good. What's that sound? Oh, it's this

1382
01:51:19,010 --> 01:51:21,659
Sound

1383
01:51:21,659 --> 01:51:22,899
Not

1384
01:51:22,899 --> 01:51:30,119
Make this a not stream. No, I did my I did my I got trapped

1385
01:51:30,760 --> 01:51:34,520
Trying to do a fucking necktie segment. Okay, I went doing that again

1386
01:51:35,159 --> 01:51:54,630
What did I get for this? What did I get for this? Oh something in the seat? Oh

1387
01:51:55,029 --> 01:51:59,430
Everything in the gift shop is available for purchase and I got

1388
01:52:00,289 --> 01:52:04,170
$2,000 too. Oh shit. This stuff is still on screen. I'm sorry

1389
01:52:04,810 --> 01:52:09,289
Alright, let's get some slippers

1390
01:52:09,850 --> 01:52:19,770
2,700 bucks some money first. That's too much. This stuff is also expensive. I just fucking I just bought it

1391
01:52:19,770 --> 01:52:22,050
I just bought it. I don't have any money left. I bought one

1392
01:52:22,569 --> 01:52:31,939
Looks like you're out of cash. I'll need to earn some money first

1393
01:52:32,579 --> 01:52:38,380
You'll need more money for that. Damn it. I hope I need that item soon

1394
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:43,819
Back to the learn Icelandic game

1395
01:52:44,420 --> 01:52:51,869
No, I have to go to bed. I hasn't even one evening in this game

1396
01:53:01,539 --> 01:53:05,579
All right, where do I where do I go to sleep you again

1397
01:53:06,060 --> 01:53:12,130
What do you think of Gunnar in terms of the treasure?

1398
01:53:12,449 --> 01:53:16,890
He tried to sabotage the festival last year and any though before that are you certain?

1399
01:53:16,890 --> 01:53:19,189
I wouldn't be surprised if this is a stunt of his

1400
01:53:20,210 --> 01:53:22,500
Bye. Bye

1401
01:53:22,500 --> 01:53:24,100
See you drew

1402
01:53:24,140 --> 01:53:26,109
Where's the bed?

1403
01:53:26,109 --> 01:53:34,579
Explore the town search the ship explore the misty skip. I can't explore the thing because I can't get up there. Wait a minute

1404
01:53:35,140 --> 01:53:36,899
This wasn't here before

1405
01:53:36,899 --> 01:53:43,760
Who let you on board if you're here for the festival? It's canceled. I didn't mean to intrude

1406
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:49,640
I just like to have a look around if that's okay. My name is Nancy Drew. I'm a visitor. I

1407
01:53:50,319 --> 01:53:52,319
Know you're a tourist

1408
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:53,560
Oh

1409
01:53:53,560 --> 01:53:55,760
Storm and boat a tourist. I'm here to investigate

1410
01:53:56,520 --> 01:54:00,840
Thanks for setting up that gangway for me, by the way, the gangway was meant for sorry

1411
01:54:00,840 --> 01:54:05,520
I didn't know he planned to let strangers on board. Are you with that snake of a woman?

1412
01:54:06,119 --> 01:54:08,300
Hey

1413
01:54:08,340 --> 01:54:15,020
Yes, Dagny, yes, I'm working with her if you're after just the gold I want nothing to do with you leave

1414
01:54:16,260 --> 01:54:20,619
Wait, I'm not after any treasure. I just want to help find Magnus

1415
01:54:21,619 --> 01:54:23,500
Magnus

1416
01:54:23,500 --> 01:54:29,340
Look, I think we might have gotten off on the wrong foot. Maybe I should start over. My name's Nancy

1417
01:54:29,659 --> 01:54:36,460
It's really nice different voice actress. I'm Elizabeth. I run the misty skip club in town. What do you want with Magnus?

1418
01:54:36,460 --> 01:54:40,619
Oh good. So you know him. Hmm. That's a question

1419
01:54:41,260 --> 01:54:48,350
Is it I thought I knew him maybe I was wrong. He's a pretty mysterious guy sounds like quite the mysterious guy

1420
01:54:48,590 --> 01:54:52,949
It doesn't matter I want nothing to do with him now or you

1421
01:54:53,789 --> 01:54:57,890
It's in the bag

1422
01:54:57,890 --> 01:54:59,890
Ma'am, can I take a look at that bag, please?

1423
01:55:00,250 --> 01:55:06,420
Hey, Elizabeth, may I borrow a snowmobile key?

1424
01:55:07,140 --> 01:55:09,140
Depends are you going to steal it?

1425
01:55:09,460 --> 01:55:14,420
Not this time. I think I'd have trouble fitting it into my carry-on luggage. It is a different person

1426
01:55:14,420 --> 01:55:18,079
Here's the key. We have tourists take them every year. I'm watching you

1427
01:55:19,060 --> 01:55:25,279
Always use the provided seat belt snow looks soft until you land headfirst

1428
01:55:25,760 --> 01:55:27,760
She stole it last time

1429
01:55:27,960 --> 01:55:30,960
What do you think happened to Magnus? The current rumor is that he fell overboard

1430
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:36,479
Do you think happened to Magnus the current rumor is that he fell overboard? Do I think he is drowned?

1431
01:55:36,479 --> 01:55:38,479
Is that what you're asking?

1432
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:45,779
He might have I didn't mean that I didn't mean it that way. I certainly hope so

1433
01:55:46,420 --> 01:55:50,220
Some people think he ran off with some old treasure. It may be a coincidence

1434
01:55:51,140 --> 01:55:54,539
It may not Danny doesn't think it was a coincidence at all

1435
01:55:55,180 --> 01:55:57,180
So I do like

1436
01:55:57,739 --> 01:56:03,819
Just a bit here and there even I've really really want to go shop at Old Navy now

1437
01:56:04,060 --> 01:56:06,859
Because everyone that we've seen so far was in an Old Navy

1438
01:56:08,340 --> 01:56:10,859
Too lofty to concern himself with human affairs

1439
01:56:11,859 --> 01:56:19,100
Do not go to Old Navy

1440
01:56:19,659 --> 01:56:27,289
Old Navy gaming what did Gunnar do anything unusual leading up to the festival?

1441
01:56:27,449 --> 01:56:32,729
Well, if you include the two festivals before this one, they look like mannequins he ruined them single-handedly

1442
01:56:33,210 --> 01:56:36,850
Aside from that only the usual threat. Oh, thank you. Oh, Navy game

1443
01:56:37,369 --> 01:56:39,369
And sent him out to sea

1444
01:56:40,930 --> 01:56:42,930
Bye bye

1445
01:56:46,529 --> 01:56:53,649
We really got it getting we got to get in that that twitch culture, you know, I mean we got to get in there

1446
01:56:54,289 --> 01:56:59,350
What are you doing using your key? Hey, what are you doing? Oh, that doesn't fit

1447
01:57:00,069 --> 01:57:12,600
Crows nest. Let's go up

1448
01:57:12,640 --> 01:57:16,140
Jesus

1449
01:57:16,140 --> 01:57:18,979
86

1450
01:57:18,979 --> 01:57:45,210
80 what does 86 mean? Is that I don't know. This is a currency thing

1451
01:57:45,729 --> 01:57:50,449
Is this some kind of currency thing? All right, let's get down. How do I get down?

1452
01:57:50,890 --> 01:57:53,779
I'd be careful up here though. At any moment I could like I

1453
01:57:55,100 --> 01:58:03,069
Think I'm I could I could slip. Oh, oh shit up. Oh, I

1454
01:58:03,869 --> 01:58:26,579
Lost the game capture

1455
01:58:29,569 --> 01:58:32,529
80s it was some kind of currency thing 86 is that a currency? Oh

1456
01:58:33,810 --> 01:58:39,590
Wow, the Aurora boiling house. Thank you right now, right? It's absolutely beautiful

1457
01:58:40,590 --> 01:59:00,899
Something like that. Why did you do that? Why do you sound like me? What?

1458
01:59:03,210 --> 01:59:08,159
Why do you sound like me? All right, let's take this

1459
01:59:30,029 --> 01:59:37,060
Pretty good song

1460
01:59:37,180 --> 01:59:42,829
Captain's log

1461
01:59:42,829 --> 01:59:47,439
Thank you. Hank cheesecake for the five community sets are really appreciate that

1462
01:59:50,340 --> 01:59:52,970
Here it is one more time for you

1463
01:59:53,529 --> 02:00:01,369
Masts from tallest to shortest. We already did this. We just cheated for this one. That's fine

1464
02:00:01,890 --> 02:00:11,760
My pretend to steer the boat. All right, Nancy put it down. Wow, I can

1465
02:00:12,340 --> 02:00:30,960
Can I honk the horn? I don't think I can honk the horn. I let me um, let me go to the snowmobile

1466
02:00:31,600 --> 02:00:35,569
What is this?

1467
02:00:35,770 --> 02:00:46,380
What we need a gas for Oh the book for the snowmobile

1468
02:00:50,250 --> 02:01:07,210
That makes sense. I kind of want to take a look back here though. Can I know just leave just leave leave

1469
02:01:08,010 --> 02:01:11,359
What looks like this day is in good shape?

1470
02:01:19,699 --> 02:01:35,779
All right to the snowmobile let's go hello. Hello. Oh, that's my ring tone

1471
02:01:36,659 --> 02:01:42,350
No, I'm already getting closer all the time. I thought that was my swishy

1472
02:01:42,949 --> 02:01:44,789
outdoor winter pants

1473
02:01:44,789 --> 02:01:48,260
It's hard to get people to talk though

1474
02:01:49,380 --> 02:01:57,399
Yes, I've managed to narrow down that the treasure is related to the ship somehow, but beyond that I haven't figured out the specifics

1475
02:02:02,409 --> 02:02:05,670
Of course, then will you take any other photos of yourself

1476
02:02:08,569 --> 02:02:10,569
Sunday it's our anniversary

1477
02:02:12,050 --> 02:02:26,140
We had reservations for dinner remember Ned dot dot dot

1478
02:02:27,539 --> 02:02:32,079
So am I under the impression that

1479
02:02:32,859 --> 02:02:36,460
She forgot about their anniversary when they had a reservation planned

1480
02:02:36,779 --> 02:02:48,710
But instead she got on a plane to Iceland or is he here too? And why does

1481
02:02:49,189 --> 02:02:51,109
What does he not know this?

1482
02:02:51,109 --> 02:02:59,560
Sorry, Ned. I forgot about our anniversary. It's not like I'm in traffic on the way home. Oh, that's right. Shit our anniversary

1483
02:02:59,640 --> 02:03:04,640
I'm coming right home. No, I mean Ned. I'm in Iceland and I'll see you in two weeks

1484
02:03:04,800 --> 02:03:11,279
I'm so so so sorry. I completely forgot

1485
02:03:20,659 --> 02:03:29,550
This case is really important

1486
02:03:39,350 --> 02:03:51,899
Do you like gasoline? All right gasoline. All right, let's go

1487
02:03:54,140 --> 02:03:56,140
Yeah, no shit

1488
02:04:02,930 --> 02:04:04,930
Let's go

1489
02:04:07,060 --> 02:04:11,670
I'm on the

1490
02:04:12,109 --> 02:04:28,770
Why is there a magic cave not a big fan of exploring caves in the dark. I'll need a light source

1491
02:04:29,770 --> 02:04:31,289
Use your phone

1492
02:04:31,289 --> 02:04:42,539
You kidding me. I'm not a big fan of it. I came all the way out here for no reason. I'll need a light source

1493
02:04:43,260 --> 02:04:53,460
Here do I think this is um, I don't know

1494
02:04:54,479 --> 02:04:56,479
somewhere post 2010

1495
02:04:57,000 --> 02:05:00,609
That this isn't supposed to be like the early 2000

1496
02:05:12,159 --> 02:05:17,260
Drive to Ned's house

1497
02:05:17,260 --> 02:05:20,859
This takes place in like 2014 or something

1498
02:05:21,460 --> 02:05:24,020
All right. I need a flashlight. I mean, what is this sketch piece?

1499
02:05:24,619 --> 02:05:32,300
The number 86 was carved into the mast

1500
02:05:33,300 --> 02:05:36,939
learning about the ship

1501
02:05:37,939 --> 02:05:44,659
He could have gone left there. I thought somebody was just making a joke because like the cave on the left thing

1502
02:05:44,659 --> 02:05:48,279
I actually do have a name, you know, it's Nancy

1503
02:05:48,659 --> 02:05:50,659
This is the 30-second Nancy Drew game

1504
02:05:50,659 --> 02:05:54,659
Get your little lady bones into the prep area and get some Torremotor orders ready

1505
02:05:54,659 --> 02:05:58,659
It's all hands-on back for the lunch rush. Wait, cooking segment?

1506
02:05:59,060 --> 02:06:04,500
I'm a sleuth not a chef. Are you sure you want me back there handling the sharp stuff?

1507
02:06:04,859 --> 02:06:09,380
You're eating a lot in here for free. Why does every Nancy Drew game have cooking food in it?

1508
02:06:09,380 --> 02:06:14,060
So it's only fair to get some good work out of you. Well might as well take a stab at it

1509
02:06:18,010 --> 02:06:21,840
Oh my god, this is not cooking

1510
02:06:22,520 --> 02:06:27,939
Fill the Torremotor tray according to the order where they eat penguins

1511
02:06:28,579 --> 02:06:30,880
they eat penguins and

1512
02:06:31,039 --> 02:06:37,840
All requests must be filled though. Some compartments may be empty orders can be filled in one of two ways across a row

1513
02:06:38,520 --> 02:06:42,680
And in a Z shape within a color tiny group

1514
02:06:43,359 --> 02:06:47,640
When checking whether an order is complete empty spaces don't count. I don't know what this is telling me

1515
02:06:48,199 --> 02:06:52,550
All requests must be filled though some can some compartments can be empty

1516
02:06:53,149 --> 02:07:00,130
They can do they can go in a Z shape

1517
02:07:00,569 --> 02:07:04,220
When checking whether an order is complete empty spaces don't count

1518
02:07:04,939 --> 02:07:13,409
Remember that each row and each color tray group counts as one order and must contain no extra items

1519
02:07:13,409 --> 02:07:18,529
The row below has an extra Lundy so it doesn't meet the order requirements when all orders are filled

1520
02:07:18,529 --> 02:07:21,449
You receive any remaining tips choose to make a new order

1521
02:07:21,970 --> 02:07:29,279
What I mean, that's not a penguin is it like molded up ice cream to look like a penguin I don't understand

1522
02:07:29,279 --> 02:07:30,439
What are you talking about?

1523
02:07:30,439 --> 02:07:35,909
fill them

1524
02:07:35,909 --> 02:07:37,909
Okay time to get to work

1525
02:07:38,390 --> 02:07:39,899
lax

1526
02:07:39,899 --> 02:07:41,899
Lundy and Hikaro

1527
02:07:41,899 --> 02:07:46,699
so the first order is a

1528
02:07:47,880 --> 02:07:49,880
one order of I

1529
02:07:50,989 --> 02:07:55,630
I I I I one order of that and then okay order done

1530
02:08:01,949 --> 02:08:09,479
Then hey, whoa, whoa. Whoa, I'm doing it. I'm going

1531
02:08:12,119 --> 02:08:19,109
Alright new water get it out ship it out of here. Did I do it faster? Oh

1532
02:08:23,380 --> 02:08:26,220
I know and I can't do it faster than that. It's just too confusing

1533
02:08:27,020 --> 02:08:29,020
Just doing Z's only Z's. I don't care

1534
02:08:37,340 --> 02:08:38,859
And then then

1535
02:08:38,859 --> 02:08:47,180
And then sheep and then sheep down here and then fish and then that no, no, no fucked it up. What's happening?

1536
02:08:48,180 --> 02:08:52,699
this one good got it and then wait, no, I have to desist

1537
02:09:14,020 --> 02:09:21,310
I

1538
02:09:27,029 --> 02:09:29,029
That one's done I got

1539
02:09:29,350 --> 02:09:31,350
No, this one

1540
02:09:31,350 --> 02:09:38,970
This is this is dumb

1541
02:09:39,529 --> 02:09:44,260
it just needs three three and

1542
02:09:44,899 --> 02:09:57,510
No, get in there. What are you? I have no idea what he's doing. Neither do I have no idea what's going on

1543
02:09:57,510 --> 02:10:01,850
I thought I was gonna be flipping pancakes

1544
02:10:06,380 --> 02:10:09,020
Why would you put me back here, I don't know what any

1545
02:10:09,659 --> 02:10:18,500
That one looked really easy wait, hold on wait, wait, wait, wait, wait shit. Wait, wait. Okay. This one. No, this one looks easy

1546
02:10:19,180 --> 02:10:43,439
shit

1547
02:10:43,439 --> 02:11:09,199
How do I fix this? I need two and then one I'm confused

1548
02:11:10,520 --> 02:11:13,779
it can be in a Z or

1549
02:11:14,380 --> 02:11:19,180
Cross or a cross has to be I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it

1550
02:11:19,180 --> 02:11:28,390
I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it

1551
02:11:28,390 --> 02:11:30,760
This is

1552
02:11:31,479 --> 02:11:34,260
Then we need a

1553
02:11:34,260 --> 02:11:46,989
This one hair has to be done. Now this one top one. What's top one top one is? Oh, god. Damn it

1554
02:11:46,989 --> 02:11:56,119
Give me a break. This is the easiest thing ever. It's it's not the easiest thing ever. I

1555
02:11:56,840 --> 02:12:22,649
Need to get that there or yeah, I can't move cuz it has to I wish I could pick it up and didn't oh

1556
02:12:23,010 --> 02:12:28,210
You motherfucker. Why does it I'm trying to pick this one up?

1557
02:12:28,210 --> 02:12:30,210
Why is it giving me like a ton of them?

1558
02:12:30,529 --> 02:13:15,800
It's the same fucking thing. All right, if I flip these I would love to flip these so we got to do

1559
02:13:16,579 --> 02:13:27,739
Sheep on left. What do you mean on left put a bad review on Yelp?

1560
02:13:28,380 --> 02:13:40,770
Fix the bottom row. I can't I can't I can't I can't there's not enough spaces. There's not enough spaces

1561
02:13:41,729 --> 02:14:12,770
Switch the rows. No, that's not correct. I

1562
02:14:13,770 --> 02:14:20,220
Give me fuck out of here speak up now

1563
02:14:23,840 --> 02:14:28,579
Elizabeth said you threaten Magnus pretty directly. I did it was

1564
02:14:29,359 --> 02:14:31,359
How do you call it friendship?

1565
02:14:33,600 --> 02:14:36,199
Friendship that's friendship to you. What are you on about?

1566
02:14:37,600 --> 02:14:39,600
It still seems a little strange

1567
02:14:40,520 --> 02:14:42,520
spoken by a woman with no friends

1568
02:14:43,039 --> 02:14:49,050
Hey, I have friends and I have boyfriend who I am ditching to be here talking to you

1569
02:14:49,050 --> 02:14:51,050
My friends are back in the US

Does this dickhead not understand that it's thousands of dollars to travel across the world?

1574
02:15:07,210 --> 02:15:08,909
How can you expect?

1575
02:15:08,909 --> 02:15:11,550

02:15:16,590 --> 02:15:29,449
You spend a lot of time in the pub, don't you why what kind of a question is that?

1578
02:15:31,289 --> 02:15:33,850
Sitting in the pub crying over a tiny

1579
02:15:37,449 --> 02:15:43,279
Ever lost in the writing it all down at the wind be little notebook. No would be

1580
02:15:43,819 --> 02:15:50,939

1581
02:15:51,619 --> 02:15:53,619
I am a predator

1582
02:15:54,140 --> 02:15:58,720
Did you go to the festival this year? Is this your hook?

1583
02:15:59,680 --> 02:16:07,640
Embarrassing for you. Well, everyone else is scrambling around for hidden treasure embarrassing when I was so young

1584
02:16:08,039 --> 02:16:12,760
We fought over things like longest fish and shiny sport

1585
02:16:13,199 --> 02:16:19,439
Gold ever since that sword took over the festival running. It's been straight to the bottom with it

1586
02:16:20,439 --> 02:16:26,609
Did Magnus ever say anything about a treasure chest that you may have found

1587
02:16:27,250 --> 02:16:35,559
Did Magnus ever say anything about the treasure a lazy purple? Thanks for the raid. Welcome everybody

1590
02:16:52,719 --> 02:16:55,200
Because every time somebody rated before I would be like, hey, what's up guys?

1591
02:16:55,719 --> 02:16:59,579
Not now see I'm like fucked up. So you don't want to watch this spring, right?

1592
02:17:00,379 --> 02:17:03,120

1596
02:17:32,540 --> 02:17:33,739

1598
02:17:40,440 --> 02:17:44,780
What did I get $750 from I find it on the ground?

1599
02:17:45,459 --> 02:17:58,659
All right, 86. I need to find out more. Look at this is definitely a puzzle

1600
02:17:59,219 --> 02:18:04,180
Can I get some puzzles and no?

1601
02:18:05,239 --> 02:18:07,239
needing to know what

1602
02:18:07,760 --> 02:18:16,430
Masts and sails on boats are is not a puzzle. That's information. I want a puzzle not info

1603
02:18:16,750 --> 02:18:35,959
I gotta learn more about the ship. I need a flashlight. Can I go in? Let's go over here. You got any new info for me?

1604
02:18:36,479 --> 02:18:44,190
You do you have anything like what about these sketches? I didn't think it was possible to be this cold

1605
02:18:44,989 --> 02:18:50,860
Can't you go inside the hell you're asking people to fix this broken heater so I can watch over my ship

1606
02:18:50,860 --> 02:18:55,899
You know what Gunnar told me freeze for all I care. He is the worst human being

1607
02:18:56,260 --> 02:18:59,700
Maybe I can help you out with that heater. Then do you know how to do?

1608
02:19:00,500 --> 02:19:04,819
Machine things I've picked up a few things. Okay. I don't care what they

1609
02:19:05,379 --> 02:19:10,819
You're okay, Nancy Drew. Thanks for showing me that I need to up the price on that to like 5,000

1610
02:19:11,899 --> 02:19:20,090
This is good data. I'm collecting here. Do you want this?

1611
02:19:20,850 --> 02:19:26,530
Sorry, can't talk need heat teeth freezing into tiny inside fix the heater

1612
02:19:26,530 --> 02:19:29,489
There's no Peter outside. What are you talking about the pubs around the corner?

1613
02:19:29,489 --> 02:19:35,010
You could always go inside or you could fix the heater gee, I wonder which of us will cave first

1614
02:19:35,530 --> 02:19:37,530
What's the what are you talking about?

1615
02:19:38,049 --> 02:19:42,049
So we're gonna do this middle management style. That is what I'm where am I and I?

1616
02:19:42,610 --> 02:19:47,649
Supervise each of those circuit pieces will attach anywhere on this mine sweeper special numbers

1617
02:19:47,649 --> 02:19:52,170
You've got to watch out for covered numbers add together to give that piece a total value

1618
02:19:52,170 --> 02:19:57,209
If you can use all five pieces to hit all five target values the heater will be fixed

1619
02:19:57,850 --> 02:20:06,250
You know, I made this like that's how electricity works. Oh, yeah. Okay. Where'd you get your PhD in electricity again?

1620
02:20:07,329 --> 02:20:09,329
Are you sure I don't have to?

1621
02:20:09,489 --> 02:20:11,489
tighten a valve or

1622
02:20:12,399 --> 02:20:14,129
find a

1623
02:20:14,129 --> 02:20:17,450
valve under a mat and then screwed on to here I

1624
02:20:21,959 --> 02:20:24,360
So we need to have

1625
02:20:25,159 --> 02:20:30,879
If you know this much why haven't you tried to fix it yet. Hey if I had to do all the hard thinking around here

1626
02:20:30,879 --> 02:20:38,559
You'd be out of a job. So where'd you come from the United States? Hey me too. Where in the u.s. South

1627
02:20:39,799 --> 02:20:45,760

1628
02:20:45,760 --> 02:20:51,840

1632
02:21:06,280 --> 02:21:11,440
It's smoked. I mean are you an open book with every stranger who crosses your path place it

1633
02:21:11,440 --> 02:21:16,180
No, I guess I don't like to talk about myself much either. What's your jam?

1634
02:21:16,739 --> 02:21:23,940
Witness protection program arch nemesis. None of those I guess it's that I meet so many interesting people. I just feel

1635
02:21:24,860 --> 02:21:31,860
Ordinary by comparison. That was a strangest wiring panel. I've ever seen but I think the heat's on you're electrocuting her

1636
02:21:33,340 --> 02:21:35,340
Toasty feels just like

1637
02:21:36,180 --> 02:21:40,139

1638
02:21:40,899 --> 02:21:47,819
Up in the hill keeps a key in her bag talk about refusing to let go but there's no way she'd ever give it to you

1639
02:21:47,819 --> 02:21:49,819
We'd find another way to get in there

1640
02:21:53,299 --> 02:21:55,299
Check out the cabin

02:21:56,540 --> 02:22:02,049

1658
02:23:16,129 --> 02:23:26,209

02:23:41,489 --> 02:23:44,479
All right, dude. Okay, man

1662
02:23:45,399 --> 02:24:01,389
Wow, sure. Can you believe what somebody just said? I can't believe somebody said that just that's disgusting behavior

1663
02:24:01,389 --> 02:24:07,239
It's disgusting to me. That's somebody said that I could do the battery

1664
02:24:07,639 --> 02:24:25,620
Wait, turn around. Can I go in any of these rooms go on this one? Alright, this is the captain's room

1665
02:24:26,139 --> 02:24:31,860
Each row column contains exactly two of each toy

1666
02:24:33,950 --> 02:24:39,469
No, not one of these both puffins are to the right of both dogs. No adjacent toys of the same kind

1667
02:24:39,950 --> 02:24:42,110
No ponies in the left half of the cupboard

1668
02:24:42,989 --> 02:24:47,549
Both dogs are somewhere to the left of both puffins. The puffins are between the ponies. The dogs are adjacent

1669
02:24:48,270 --> 02:24:56,510
Who was that a locator?

1670
02:24:56,510 --> 02:24:58,510
Here's your puzzle. This is not a puzzle

1671
02:24:59,149 --> 02:25:02,670
Wow an antique desk and it's in pristine condition

1672
02:25:03,950 --> 02:25:09,520
Time to break it open. I need to figure out the rules being used in each row here

1673
02:25:11,649 --> 02:25:15,170
Fill in the three squares to complete the sequence using each of the rows

1674
02:25:30,670 --> 02:25:32,110
one two

1675
02:25:32,110 --> 02:25:34,110
Let's I don't know three

1676
02:25:34,510 --> 02:25:38,430
Three two one three two plus three is five. I don't know three and

1677
02:25:39,950 --> 02:25:41,229
one and then

1678
02:25:41,229 --> 02:25:43,229
Uh, two two is four

1679
02:25:43,229 --> 02:25:51,979
Yeah, they they add

1680
02:25:52,299 --> 02:25:58,510
What about this? Does the color mean anything?

1681
02:26:00,770 --> 02:26:02,770
One to the two to the two to the three

1682
02:26:06,110 --> 02:26:17,870
That's just one two three

1683
02:26:17,870 --> 02:26:20,829
No, it's two to the one to the one to the three

1684
02:26:21,709 --> 02:26:29,020
What is somebody going to what does that sound is somebody in the bathroom?

1685
02:26:29,579 --> 02:26:37,569
That was weird

1686
02:26:37,569 --> 02:26:39,649
What's the solution? I don't care

1687
02:26:39,649 --> 02:26:41,649
This is not even puzzles

1688
02:26:42,129 --> 02:26:44,530
These are all right. I'm gonna say it and I don't like even

1689
02:26:45,250 --> 02:26:47,250
I don't know. I don't like saying this

1690
02:26:47,329 --> 02:26:49,329
I don't like saying this. I don't i'm gonna say it though

1691
02:26:49,649 --> 02:26:51,520
I'm gonna say this is

1692
02:26:51,520 --> 02:26:54,879
This is like this is boomer puzzle because this is like the shit that they do in a newspaper

1693
02:26:55,200 --> 02:26:56,799
This is a newspaper puzzle

1694
02:26:56,799 --> 02:27:01,360
This is not find who the murderer is or unravel the mystery. This is open up

1695
02:27:02,319 --> 02:27:04,319
page 16 of a newspaper

1696
02:27:04,639 --> 02:27:07,100
There's a this is

1697
02:27:07,100 --> 02:27:12,659
Come on, you should be good at it. Then read the newspaper

1698
02:27:13,899 --> 02:27:16,459
I don't like the way that it feels it. I don't like how it feels my hands

1699
02:27:16,459 --> 02:27:20,860
It's like weird and like sandy and crusty and it may it dry. I don't like it. I hate it

1700
02:27:21,579 --> 02:27:30,290
When I okay, those of you that don't get it next time you have a newspaper

1701
02:27:31,010 --> 02:27:32,959
on your person

1702
02:27:32,959 --> 02:27:37,440
Just like open it and like take and grab and like slide your fingers up and down it and touch it

1703
02:27:38,079 --> 02:27:44,559
Grab it. It's dry and gross and fucking I hate the way it feels. I fucking hate it. I hate it so much

1704
02:27:45,280 --> 02:27:50,879
Thinking about holding and turning and sliding and grabbing a newspaper makes me want to do. Ah, it's the worst

1705
02:27:51,520 --> 02:27:56,530
It's like nails on a chalkboard. Um, uh, just give me the solution. What is it?

1706
02:27:59,950 --> 02:28:03,950
All rows add up for five six seven eight nine all rows add up to nine. Thanks for that. Appreciate it

1707
02:28:04,270 --> 02:28:07,790
Five six seven eight nine one two three four five six seven

1708
02:28:08,590 --> 02:28:09,870
eight nine

1709
02:28:09,870 --> 02:28:12,750
Uh, what two four five six seven eight nine?

1710
02:28:13,709 --> 02:28:15,709
so it actually was two to the three to the

1711
02:28:17,309 --> 02:28:19,309
six seven eight nine

1712
02:28:19,629 --> 02:28:21,629
Yeah, it was two to the three to the one

1713
02:28:23,299 --> 02:28:25,299
six seven eight nine

1714
02:28:25,620 --> 02:28:30,180
Three four five six seven eight nine five six seven eight nine. Wait one

1715
02:28:33,280 --> 02:28:35,280
Five six seven eight nine

One two, three six seven eight nine six seven eight nine. What do you that's not working?

1717
02:28:43,170 --> 02:28:58,909
Does this row meet? Hold on. Wait six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirty fourteen

1718
02:28:59,549 --> 02:29:01,329

1719
02:29:01,329 --> 02:29:02,770
colors at the top

1720
02:29:02,770 --> 02:29:06,799
And what the hell does that matter does it have to be three in each row?

1721
02:29:08,670 --> 02:29:10,670
So five six seven eight nine

1722
02:29:12,799 --> 02:29:15,280
Two four five six seven eight nine

1723
02:29:15,840 --> 02:29:26,020
It has to be four red and three yellow. Okay, so that's one that's six seven eight nine

1724
02:29:26,659 --> 02:29:35,760
I don't think that's correct

1725
02:29:42,860 --> 02:29:44,459
three not two

1726
02:29:44,459 --> 02:29:46,459
Two three four five six seven eight nine

1727
02:29:48,979 --> 02:29:55,969
Why is it five another key? How many keys do we have?

1728
02:30:00,690 --> 02:30:03,010
See this one has lines on it so that means you can tell i don't care

1729
02:30:03,809 --> 02:30:05,809
Screenshot it if you care about it

1730
02:30:09,979 --> 02:30:11,979
A code I have to hold this up

1731
02:30:13,340 --> 02:30:15,979
Looks like one of these words is scrambled with no no

1732
02:30:16,600 --> 02:30:18,600
Magnus just saved

1733
02:30:19,020 --> 02:30:23,260
Games from the newspaper. He was gonna do this later. This has nothing to do with anything

1734
02:30:25,409 --> 02:30:26,770
You think it does?

1735
02:30:26,770 --> 02:30:30,450
But it doesn't

1736
02:30:30,450 --> 02:30:31,329
Okay

1737
02:30:31,329 --> 02:30:36,379
uh clue

1738
02:30:37,020 --> 02:30:38,700
Do I have to get all of these?

1739
02:30:38,700 --> 02:30:40,700
I have to get every single one. No, I don't

1740
02:30:45,280 --> 02:30:51,440
See clue

1741
02:30:51,440 --> 02:30:53,440
What is a what is a clue?

1742
02:30:55,440 --> 02:30:57,440

1743
02:30:59,010 --> 02:31:00,209
a clue

1744
02:31:00,209 --> 02:31:06,420

Drew clue

1747
02:31:10,819 --> 02:31:12,979
Where is it? I need to find that first. I don't care about anything else

1748
02:31:13,780 --> 02:31:15,780
See just look for c's

1750
02:31:34,190 --> 02:31:43,440
No, what does it just want me to click them? That's not word search

1751
02:31:51,329 --> 02:31:56,420
Yeah

1752
02:31:56,420 --> 02:31:58,909
Uh, I thought it was a word search

1753
02:32:01,069 --> 02:32:04,110
Oh, no, this is bad. This is gonna be horrible

1754
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,659
C l e w is it why is it not scratched off?

1755
02:32:22,590 --> 02:32:28,309

This is stupid though

1762
02:32:55,819 --> 02:32:57,579

Write these down on a piece of paper

1980
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:15,639
I'm gonna try the locator. Yeah, that's what I was thinking. It doesn't seem to do anything

02:52:18,200 --> 02:52:20,200
Take a picture of it. Oh good idea

1982
02:52:32,729 --> 02:52:36,170

1985
02:53:02,840 --> 02:53:36,719
I think I need to get all the wooden sections pressed down. What's going on? Oh down. They have to be pressed

1986
02:53:56,040 --> 02:54:18,540
God damn it. Did I what I won the secret egg?

1987
02:54:23,229 --> 02:54:28,360
Okay, I got I got the egg. What does that do? Yeah that that that deserves quite a few

1988
02:54:29,159 --> 02:54:30,280
of the

1989
02:54:30,280 --> 02:54:35,639
That thing that people say when something crazy happens and scary and I don't know what the fuck

1990
02:54:37,530 --> 02:54:39,209
Dude

1991
02:54:39,209 --> 02:54:41,709

1995
02:54:54,030 --> 02:55:01,709
Pro bar

1996
02:55:01,709 --> 02:55:03,709
More clues haven't done that

1997
02:55:04,430 --> 02:55:06,430
What else is in here? Oh a suitcase

1998
02:55:07,920 --> 02:55:10,479
Can you pet dog in nancy drew?

1999
02:55:11,840 --> 02:55:13,840
Shadow on the ocean. Yes

2000
02:55:14,319 --> 02:55:36,559
They look who is this still to find clues for this shit. I better find some pins first. Wait

2001
02:55:37,690 --> 02:55:41,120
This is um

2002
02:55:41,120 --> 02:55:42,639
Isn't this it?

2003
02:55:42,639 --> 02:55:43,680
No

2004
02:55:43,680 --> 02:55:50,590
Hold up a piece of paper pins

2005
02:55:51,229 --> 02:55:59,000
What do I get pins?

2006
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:01,000
Those cities are one-letter names

2007
02:56:07,209 --> 02:56:09,209
Yeah, I can't wait to go to gee

2008
02:56:09,610 --> 02:56:13,610
I wonder if that's why she called me instead of going to the police about magnus

2009
02:56:14,409 --> 02:56:19,530
Have you been running your mouth hope you realize it's going to take a lot of dough to make this disappear

2010
02:56:20,010 --> 02:56:23,469
Iceland government reports big treasure to be found

2011
02:56:31,500 --> 02:56:32,860
All right, where the pins?

2012
02:56:32,860 --> 02:56:51,690
I'm apparently still not done in this office. I guess not

2013
02:56:52,329 --> 02:57:09,930
Let's go talk shit. She's not here anymore. I got a lot of stuff

2014
02:57:10,649 --> 02:57:14,110
Jeremy, can you pass the cereal box? No

2015
02:57:15,680 --> 02:57:17,680
You guys remember when I was gonna do the stream?

2016
02:57:18,239 --> 02:57:19,200
where

2017
02:57:19,280 --> 02:57:24,959
I bought a shitload of cereal boxes and we did all the activities on just put the camera on

2018
02:57:29,819 --> 02:57:32,059
And then I had I realized

2019
02:57:33,520 --> 02:57:34,959
that you

2020
02:57:34,959 --> 02:57:36,479
That would be so

2021
02:57:36,479 --> 02:57:41,100
horrible

2022
02:57:41,100 --> 02:57:43,100
Because what I would what I actually would end up doing

2023
02:57:44,379 --> 02:57:45,899
I would have

2024
02:57:45,899 --> 02:57:48,540
20 30 plus cereal boxes in this room

2025
02:57:50,350 --> 02:57:52,000
and I would

2026
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:56,559
Be drawn on them and shit and then i'm thinking what am I going to do with this much cereal?

2027
02:57:57,850 --> 02:57:59,930
Uh

2028
02:57:59,930 --> 02:58:04,170
And I could I could only donate it to like a food like a food pantry

2029
02:58:05,129 --> 02:58:08,409
Then that's makes sense. But then all the boxes would be wicked fucked up

2030
02:58:08,969 --> 02:58:11,920
And that's like maybe I could take the bags out

2031
02:58:12,479 --> 02:58:16,399
Right, like take the bags out and just keep the boxes and then recycle the boxes

2032
02:58:17,559 --> 02:58:19,559
And then donate the bags

2033
02:58:19,879 --> 02:58:22,030
Would that make sense?

2034
02:58:22,030 --> 02:58:25,930
Does it put labels on the bags?

2035
02:58:26,090 --> 02:58:31,819
Do you think they would care if you did the puzzles on the box?

2036
02:58:33,870 --> 02:58:35,870
Well, no, but I mean, I I don't know

2037
02:58:36,670 --> 02:58:38,989
It's am I I don't know. It might be like messy

2038
02:58:39,870 --> 02:58:41,469
what if I like

2039
02:58:41,469 --> 02:58:46,510
Mess up and I get angry and I like oh god, I like stabbed the box a bunch of times

2040
02:58:46,590 --> 02:58:48,989
He's fucking bad. I didn't think everyone laughs

2041
02:58:49,709 --> 02:58:57,840
You know what i'm saying?

2042
02:58:57,840 --> 02:59:00,079
I I need batteries for my flashlight

2043
02:59:02,360 --> 02:59:06,600
Wait, let's go check on a couple things here. Let's go talk to you. I got some shit to tell you

2044
02:59:08,079 --> 02:59:10,079
Uh, I need to know some things

2045
02:59:10,159 --> 02:59:18,559
Who was present at the time of the festival raging at a cereal box? Who else did you see only gunner elizabeth and soren were thoroughly mia

2046
02:59:18,879 --> 02:59:23,680
Although half of iceland is probably related to itself. So people kind of look alike could have missed something

2047
02:59:24,719 --> 02:59:33,850
How'd you meet magnus? I heard about the rumor of the treasure through my connections then I approached him

2048
02:59:34,489 --> 02:59:38,090
He's a hard guy to pin down that blind up all the cereal and glue it to your hair

2049
02:59:39,370 --> 02:59:42,649
I just happened to come in at an opportune moment

2050
02:59:43,979 --> 02:59:49,020
Magnus do with a treasure. Why would I do that desperately wants to buy his own ship true? Not true

2051
02:59:49,819 --> 02:59:51,979
That makes no sense. Ship guys are like that

2052
02:59:52,940 --> 02:59:57,979
So the ship he helped rebuild isn't his we funded it, but it's town property

2053
03:00:00,670 --> 03:00:03,549
Uh, how long were you working on that ship project?

2054
03:00:04,829 --> 03:00:10,110
About two years on and off of it magnus supervised the rebuilds. I provided the cash

2055
03:00:10,750 --> 03:00:15,389
That's a long time to hang around in iceland. Have you been in skip rot all that time?

2056
03:00:16,670 --> 03:00:20,030
No, I think the locals would have offed me by now if that were the case

2057
03:00:20,270 --> 03:00:23,629
I don't like to stay in one place for too long. She's not quite 30 fps

2058
03:00:23,790 --> 03:00:30,430
If you stay in one place people start to need you and feel things about you and all that icky weird stuff

2059
03:00:30,829 --> 03:00:36,030
I'm not really the having friends type. I'd like to think you and I are on friendly terms

2060
03:00:36,510 --> 03:00:42,590
What is this are we gonna hold hands and sing campfire songs now, I don't want to do it but find my gold

2061
03:00:43,309 --> 03:00:45,309
Later, I want to do it

2062
03:00:45,549 --> 03:00:47,389
I wonder like every

2063
03:00:47,389 --> 03:00:52,430
I can't say this because if people want me to do it and they're just gonna annoy the fuck out of like half the people here

2064
03:00:53,309 --> 03:00:56,110
They really will people will be as if it was just leave and shit

2065
03:00:57,309 --> 03:00:59,309
Like whatever

2066
03:01:00,670 --> 03:01:05,950
I want to just like play like we can loud party music and put an echo in my voice every five minutes and like be like

2067
03:01:06,110 --> 03:01:08,110
Where's the drew crew?

2068
03:01:08,510 --> 03:01:11,559
Just to make sure you guys are still watching but of course you are

2069
03:01:16,139 --> 03:01:20,139
Like where's the drew crew at the club like we're at the club. I don't know

2070
03:01:23,639 --> 03:01:26,200
Do you have any batteries in here? Hi

2071
03:01:30,590 --> 03:01:33,950
Do you have anything which might help with my investigation?

2072
03:01:34,989 --> 03:01:40,030
If i'm not in town, i'm always locked up in here. I do have some very nice pamphlets though

2073
03:01:40,350 --> 03:01:45,709
The pamphlet lovers journal rated them a nine star out of ten. I put them together myself

2074
03:01:46,510 --> 03:01:48,510
Here's one for your troubles

2075
03:01:49,309 --> 03:01:54,190
Give me it's hard to turn down an award-winning pamphlet. I'll see if I can make use of this

2076
03:01:54,989 --> 03:01:56,350
Oh, okay

2077
03:01:56,350 --> 03:02:02,909
Ding dingies. Hey sailors. Did you know every year in iceland roughly 0.8 out of every 100,000 citizens die of drowning?

2078
03:02:05,450 --> 03:02:09,610
How does 80% of you drown? What one per I don't get that

2079
03:02:10,569 --> 03:02:12,569
or approximately 2.6

2080
03:02:12,569 --> 03:02:15,370
Wait, what?

2081
03:02:15,370 --> 03:02:19,129
Because modern science has not made it possible to save six-tenths of a person from drowning

2082
03:02:19,850 --> 03:02:23,690
Caution while out on the seas can be the most important factor in saving a life. It's an average

2083
03:02:24,569 --> 03:02:28,030
Oh

2084
03:02:28,030 --> 03:02:31,709
Know your motor proper voltage must be flowing to jump start a broken motor

2085
03:02:32,350 --> 03:02:35,790
As a handy guy remember these standard recommended voltages 16.9

2086
03:02:37,450 --> 03:02:39,709
1913

2087
03:02:39,709 --> 03:02:40,590
Ooh

2088
03:02:40,590 --> 03:02:45,149
Until utila hooks scraping barnacles easy pancake flipping

2089
03:02:45,770 --> 03:02:47,770
threatening political dissenters

2090
03:02:48,090 --> 03:02:51,450
Thanks, soren

2091
03:02:51,450 --> 03:02:56,819
You're kind of a psycho. All right

2092
03:02:56,979 --> 03:03:01,219
Uh, I sent some bad blood between you and gunner blood between you and gunner

2093
03:03:02,260 --> 03:03:04,659
It's more like gunner dumping bad blood onto me

2094
03:03:05,440 --> 03:03:08,899
Repeatedly while laughing. I try to be patient given his

2095
03:03:09,700 --> 03:03:15,940
History, but what a nanderthal that one. I can't reason with a man who only speaks fist

2096
03:03:17,459 --> 03:03:21,780
Between you and me he's never been the same since that terrible crash years ago

2097
03:03:22,260 --> 03:03:24,260
Didn't within the boat just crash

2098
03:03:24,659 --> 03:03:26,340
Don't know that it's my place to speak of it

2099
03:03:26,420 --> 03:03:32,260
But his boat sank to the bottom of the bay and he hasn't sailed since now. He stays locked up in that pub of his

2100
03:03:35,260 --> 03:03:37,420
So you attended the festival, right?

2101
03:03:38,299 --> 03:03:40,780
present and accounted for naturally

2102
03:03:41,719 --> 03:03:48,379
Interesting dagny says you weren't there. Why would she lie about that up in old stulka manning the controls for our audio

2103
03:03:48,860 --> 03:03:54,700
That's the tower right outside this center mind if I take a look very rarely look up I found which is a shame

2104
03:03:55,260 --> 03:03:57,260
Lots of nifty things in that direction

2105
03:03:59,909 --> 03:04:01,909
Mind if I take a look later?

2106
03:04:02,149 --> 03:04:03,530
Bye now

2107
03:04:03,530 --> 03:04:08,569
The bitcoin crash. Hey soren, can I use some of this gift wrap? Yes

2108
03:04:09,290 --> 03:04:12,969
Great now how about a magic egg? That would be fun to get

2109
03:04:14,329 --> 03:04:15,290
Oh

2110
03:04:15,290 --> 03:04:17,290
I guess it's gonna all right. It's the

2111
03:04:17,290 --> 03:04:19,030
That

2112
03:04:19,030 --> 03:04:21,590
Okay, I hope somebody wants this I need batteries

2113
03:04:26,420 --> 03:04:28,420
I'll need to earn some money first

2114
03:04:28,819 --> 03:04:30,819
I'll need to earn some money first

2115
03:04:31,139 --> 03:04:34,899
Do I actually have to go do the language things the only way to make money?

2116
03:04:36,649 --> 03:04:38,280
batteries

2117
03:04:38,280 --> 03:04:40,040
I can afford that

2118
03:04:40,040 --> 03:04:41,719
Get him in the get him in

2119
03:04:41,719 --> 03:04:44,790
All right. I got a flashlight. Let's go to the cave

2120
03:04:47,940 --> 03:04:50,260
Buy the sword. I don't have any money to buy the sword. Not yet

2121
03:04:59,620 --> 03:05:04,889
Sort of riot you don't have to riot. That'd be fine. That's where it gets scary

2122
03:05:05,610 --> 03:05:15,079
It's a glove

2123
03:05:15,079 --> 03:05:18,040
Wonder who it belongs to it belongs to the icebreaker

2124
03:05:25,379 --> 03:05:28,420
The local town in iceland's favorite professional wrestler

2125
03:05:29,139 --> 03:05:51,479
somebody in the ice

2126
03:05:51,479 --> 03:05:56,790
What's in the ice?

2127
03:05:56,790 --> 03:05:59,750
Dean dingus. No, I don't know why okay

2128
03:06:00,389 --> 03:06:07,319
What's in there?

2129
03:06:07,319 --> 03:06:09,319
I'm gonna need to melt this eventually

2130
03:06:09,559 --> 03:06:20,750
There's nothing here. What about this looks suspicious

2131
03:06:24,469 --> 03:06:31,540
These rocks. No, what was the point of even coming in here? I have to go back to the captain's quarters. Apparently I missed something

2132
03:06:32,979 --> 03:06:39,180
I got this toy bullshit the locator

2133
03:06:40,059 --> 03:06:42,420
I did get the radio key. Let me go up there

2134
03:06:42,899 --> 03:06:46,620
This is this is oh, she's back

2135
03:06:48,059 --> 03:06:50,059
Hey, yo, what's up? Can I help?

2136
03:06:50,379 --> 03:06:51,260
Yep

2137
03:06:51,260 --> 03:06:56,600
What's behind the door? So what's behind the mystery door?

2138
03:06:58,920 --> 03:07:01,159
Just an old broom closet. Can I see?

2139
03:07:02,120 --> 03:07:03,000
No

2140
03:07:03,000 --> 03:07:05,299
Not even a hint go away

2141
03:07:08,790 --> 03:07:10,229
Hey nancy

2142
03:07:10,229 --> 03:07:15,319
I spent a lot of time out here. Don't you have somewhere else to be?

2143
03:07:16,280 --> 03:07:19,319
Can you tell me about the festival sound system?

2144
03:07:19,639 --> 03:07:23,959
It's been broken for a week soren told me he was manning the sound system on the morning

2145
03:07:23,959 --> 03:07:27,639
The hierlich hide crashed what but that's not possible

2146
03:07:28,200 --> 03:07:34,360
There was no sound that day sounds like we've got an alibi that doesn't quite match either you're lying or he is

2147
03:07:34,760 --> 03:07:36,760
And i'll find out

2148
03:07:37,079 --> 03:07:40,760
Is there anything more you haven't told me about magnus? No

2149
03:07:41,559 --> 03:07:43,159
Guess you'll have to leave now

2150
03:07:43,159 --> 03:07:45,000
No sound

2151
03:07:45,700 --> 03:07:49,059
You know i'm better than anyone. I don't believe that for an instant

2152
03:07:49,620 --> 03:07:53,379
You know him better than anyone. Wait, what? I don't know him an instant

2153
03:07:59,159 --> 03:08:03,510
Didn't she didn't respond to that

2154
03:08:03,510 --> 03:08:07,350
I need your help elizabeth. I need to know what you know better than anyone

2155
03:08:09,430 --> 03:08:11,799
He is quiet

2156
03:08:13,670 --> 03:08:15,670
Keep me obsessive

2157
03:08:15,829 --> 03:08:17,590
first over his dog

2158
03:08:17,590 --> 03:08:20,149
Then over his writing then over me

2159
03:08:21,030 --> 03:08:26,709
Then over the ship why would someone like him be hiding for gold in the first place he has certain

2160
03:08:28,389 --> 03:08:32,309
He just wants treasure which we go mega lull maniac

2161
03:08:33,030 --> 03:08:39,190
He desperately wants to leave town leave island. I thought he was a captain already. Oh, he is

2162
03:08:39,750 --> 03:08:41,350
but for wealthy people

2163
03:08:41,350 --> 03:08:47,590
Private clients never his own boat never his own destination. He dreams of living like the old captains

2164
03:08:47,989 --> 03:08:53,350
Sailing wherever the wind takes the treasure not real. I see so the treasure would allow him to fulfill that dream

2165
03:08:53,430 --> 03:08:59,590
It's gonna be an old wooden leg and mongus left some guys dentures after we broke up. He called me looking for it

2166
03:09:00,229 --> 03:09:03,670
Secret map it looks like it might be the key to open some kind of box

2167
03:09:04,309 --> 03:09:08,709
But i've never seen any box like that before. I don't know why I kept it for myself

2168
03:09:09,770 --> 03:09:12,889
Maybe I wanted to see whatever it was. He saw it. Yeah, dude

2169
03:09:16,040 --> 03:09:18,120
Lines continue across the gap interesting

2170
03:09:18,680 --> 03:09:22,760
Numbers appear to show the number of touching sections which have been filled

2171
03:09:23,479 --> 03:09:27,879
Must find all five pieces to reveal these two by five. Okay

2172
03:09:29,000 --> 03:09:33,079
Uh intricate moving. Thanks elizabeth. I'm going to get to the bottom of this mess

2173
03:09:34,040 --> 03:09:36,040
We're gonna get to the bottom of this mess

2174
03:09:36,600 --> 03:09:41,899
but first

2175
03:09:41,899 --> 03:09:47,159
Just want to just give a quick little check to see to make sure we have uh

2176
03:09:49,299 --> 03:09:53,590
Those of you that are here with us

2177
03:09:53,590 --> 03:09:55,590
That are part of a very specific crew

2178
03:09:55,829 --> 03:10:09,940
I want you I want you to put oh I give up on that one. I'm not doing that

2179
03:10:16,059 --> 03:10:18,540
That was like a yeah, nah not into it

2180
03:10:19,899 --> 03:10:22,620
Has anyone checked magnus's cabin? No

2181
03:10:23,340 --> 03:10:24,299
I

2182
03:10:24,299 --> 03:10:28,569
Wanted to but you didn't or can't

2183
03:10:29,290 --> 03:10:32,809
Soren wants to do it. I had to get really high energy there and I'd

2184
03:10:34,329 --> 03:10:36,329
Can you help me find a way in?

2185
03:10:36,649 --> 03:10:38,649
No, this town takes care of its own

2186
03:10:39,530 --> 03:10:41,690
Our problems are ours. No one else is

2187
03:10:45,159 --> 03:10:50,010
Goodbye. Bye now. I was dancing. Wow. He's low energy

2188
03:10:51,690 --> 03:10:53,690
I'm getting in this fucking door

2189
03:10:54,649 --> 03:10:58,409
All right, where's the radio?

2190
03:10:58,409 --> 03:11:00,010
up here, right

2191
03:11:00,010 --> 03:11:08,260
All right. Here's the key to the radio

2192
03:11:15,180 --> 03:11:22,500
That's a radio, right? Where's this radio high energy low iq?

2193
03:11:23,459 --> 03:11:28,549
Where's the radio?

2194
03:11:28,549 --> 03:11:34,940
Where's this radio?

2195
03:11:34,940 --> 03:11:37,819
There it is. All right radio key

2196
03:11:38,700 --> 03:11:39,819
Turn it

2197
03:11:39,819 --> 03:11:43,030
Hello. Hello. Hmm. No one's there

2198
03:11:45,670 --> 03:12:03,270
Guess again. Oh, who is this? Wait? I'm not sure. Why are you you're under investigation now for the murder of

2199
03:12:06,090 --> 03:12:12,010
His name ken. Why don't I say ken operator alex lintrong speaking. Hi alex. I'm nancy

2200
03:12:15,000 --> 03:12:19,399
Hi, i'm nancy. I'm a detective trying to find out more. No, no, no, no, no, you don't go you don't i'm

2201
03:12:20,280 --> 03:12:22,280
Like don't I legally have to say i'm a cop?

2202
03:12:23,350 --> 03:12:28,069
Well, you have to be like before I say anything have to be like, oh that's great. By the way, i'm a detective with

2203
03:12:28,790 --> 03:12:38,579
You know, I do have to say that

2204
03:12:38,659 --> 03:12:44,100
You you legally have to you know, you legally have to say i'm a police officer. By the way, here's the rest of my sentence

2205
03:12:44,979 --> 03:12:46,979
That's in that's just movie shit

2206
03:12:52,360 --> 03:12:56,840
Why why am I saying that like cops are like what like a vampire if they're like a lot like wait

2207
03:12:56,840 --> 03:13:02,040
I know that wait. Hold on a minute. If if the cop comes to your door

2208
03:13:03,180 --> 03:13:05,180
Do you and they say can we come in?

2209
03:13:05,959 --> 03:13:08,139
If you invite them in

2210
03:13:08,139 --> 03:13:10,139
Hold on. I mean, I don't know these laws

2211
03:13:12,379 --> 03:13:14,540
All I know about police is through television

2212
03:13:16,139 --> 03:13:20,940
Does a cop have to announce they are a cop to you?

2213
03:13:21,739 --> 03:13:26,809
Does it does that have to happen?

2214
03:13:26,809 --> 03:13:28,969
Do cops have to tell you that they are a cop?

2215
03:13:31,530 --> 03:13:34,420
No, this is perfectly legal in most jurisdictions

2216
03:13:34,819 --> 03:13:40,500
Your question repeats one that is often asked as people for some reason assume that dishonesty by a police officer should always lead

2217
03:13:40,819 --> 03:13:48,100
To a dismissal it is only police tactics that could deprive you of some constitutional right that would lead to suppression of evidence in a subsequent dismissal

2218
03:13:49,260 --> 03:13:53,930
It's not entrapment

2219
03:13:53,930 --> 03:13:56,969
Entrapment does not simply mean that you were tricked into getting caught

2220
03:13:57,370 --> 03:14:02,969
Entrapment means that the police persuaded you to commit a crime. You had no intention of committing at the outset

2221
03:14:03,530 --> 03:14:09,450
In your case you intended to buy drugs all along you didn't just intend to get caught. There's no way what?

2222
03:14:14,299 --> 03:14:16,680
You aren't a police officer

2223
03:14:16,680 --> 03:14:22,819
Why i'm a detective

2224
03:14:23,219 --> 03:14:25,219
I'm a vampire. You shouldn't have done that

2225
03:14:25,860 --> 03:14:27,860
Well, like you know, like okay

2226
03:14:28,180 --> 03:14:30,180
I am a person outside your door

2227
03:14:30,780 --> 03:14:33,340
Yes, who is it?

2228
03:14:33,340 --> 03:14:35,420
I'm a cop. I'm a vampire

2229
03:14:36,139 --> 03:14:37,909
Can we come in?

2230
03:14:37,909 --> 03:14:39,909

03:15:13,819 --> 03:15:15,819

03:15:18,950 --> 03:15:24,709
I'll come back with a warrant

2239
03:15:25,110 --> 03:15:31,909
Slow down and stay calm. I need your help. If what you're saying is true magnus might be in serious danger

2240
03:16:09,500 --> 03:16:17,239
Why would you write that?

2241
03:16:29,180 --> 03:16:32,489

That's been notarized

2244
03:17:28,379 --> 03:17:31,899
Can you imagine that's how you had to notarize documents?

2245
03:17:32,700 --> 03:17:35,659
This is the way that you notarized documents

2246
03:17:37,319 --> 03:17:41,479

Let's go, but you don't have to handle this alone

2250
03:18:23,079 --> 03:18:27,000
I heard a voice on board. I mean he went to go check it out left the radio on

2251
03:18:28,440 --> 03:18:31,559
I'm not using that much lipstick. This is expensive lipstick

2252
03:18:32,360 --> 03:18:38,040
That's not what it is. I think this investigation just went from missing persons to abduction

2253
03:18:38,440 --> 03:18:40,760
It's dark out there and the water's cold

2254
03:18:48,389 --> 03:18:50,389
What brand is it? I don't know

2255
03:18:52,090 --> 03:18:54,659

03:18:54,659 --> 03:18:56,739

03:19:17,940 --> 03:19:22,260

2262
03:19:22,260 --> 03:19:27,540
Could you hear anything magnus said something about the ship? That's all I got. I I was too scared

2263
03:19:30,659 --> 03:19:33,540
Who are you by the way? Just a lowly undergrad

2264
03:19:33,620 --> 03:19:40,149
A cubicle a pair of headphones and a computer. I'm here on an internship for my maritime psychology degree

2265
03:19:40,709 --> 03:19:42,709
My parents said I'd never find a paying job

2266
03:19:43,110 --> 03:19:49,350
Shows them me and magnus we were kind of buddies. I mean, we never met or anything

2267
03:19:49,510 --> 03:19:51,510
You guys don't know what the what the color is

2268
03:19:54,469 --> 03:19:55,750
All right, are you?

2269

You don't sound Icelandic though. Nope

2270
03:19:59,250 --> 03:20:01,670

2277
03:20:20,709 --> 03:20:22,709
Of lipstick that have different names

Lipstick colors seriously may as well just have they may as well be create the crayola

2283
03:20:52,600 --> 03:20:56,149
There's a box of crayola. It's like 5 000 different shades

2284
03:20:57,219 --> 03:21:00,090
And they all call them different things

2285
03:21:00,090 --> 03:21:06,940
I need a way to distract someone on board this ship so you can snoop through their stuff can't

2286
03:21:07,819 --> 03:21:09,819

But the light's busted right now if you can get up there and fix that light

2290
03:21:25,510 --> 03:21:29,989
Where's the lighthouse I can stay here at hq with my cup of tea and giant snuggle blanket

03:22:00,229 --> 03:22:03,350
Calling who am I calling?

2296
03:22:03,430 --> 03:22:09,590
What on earth is a maritime psychology degree? I have a 30 page thesis answering exactly that question

2297
03:22:10,180 --> 03:22:12,180
It can all be boiled down to two words

2298
03:22:14,299 --> 03:22:17,180
Interesting

2299
03:22:17,260 --> 03:22:19,370

And I have come very very close

2305
03:22:45,079 --> 03:22:47,079
To this one in particular that

2306
03:22:47,639 --> 03:22:50,600
All the all the girls in high school when I was in high school

2307
03:22:51,559 --> 03:22:54,040
They all used this it was this cake batter

2308
03:22:55,049 --> 03:22:56,090
um

2309
03:22:56,090 --> 03:23:02,489
Lip gloss stuff and it smelled like a vanilla baking vanilla frosting cake thing

2310
03:23:03,209 --> 03:23:09,850
And I know I just I just wanted somebody to put a little bit on my finger and let me just eat it

2311
03:23:10,489 --> 03:23:12,489
I probably did if I was like, hey, can I

2312
03:23:12,569 --> 03:23:16,329

03:23:32,200 --> 03:23:34,760
You're right. That did just happen. Well, why did you say that?

2316
03:23:35,479 --> 03:23:45,829
Do remember the lip that lipstick is made from beeswax and whale vomit

2317
03:23:47,639 --> 03:23:49,639
Get the fuck out of here. Wait

2318
03:23:50,520 --> 03:23:55,559
What is lipstick? It's made out of clay or something lips. What is lipstick made out of?

2319
03:23:56,520 --> 03:23:58,520
It's like it's clay

2320
03:24:00,329 --> 03:24:02,489
Wax clay, whatever. Here it is

2321
03:24:04,809 --> 03:24:06,809
uh, it's made from

2322
03:24:11,020 --> 03:24:13,000
Here. Okay

fruit pigment

2325
03:24:17,260 --> 03:24:21,020
Strawberries are first juiced and then dehydrated into a powder. That's pretty cool

2326
03:24:21,340 --> 03:24:28,920
the powder is then soaked in oil to extract pigments and blended into a mixture of shea and cocoa butter done and then

2327
03:24:29,799 --> 03:24:33,479
Rice starch provides opacity giving the lipstick long-wearing coverage

2328
03:24:34,200 --> 03:24:36,200
right, and then

2329
03:24:36,200 --> 03:24:43,239
Uh candle candelilla wax from the candelilla plant allows the lipstick to hold its shape and then there it is

2330
03:24:46,360 --> 03:24:49,479
Yeah, it's made of the clay

2331
03:24:49,479 --> 03:24:52,200
Then they add the whale vomit. Okay. Well, what does it say that?

2332
03:24:53,260 --> 03:24:53,979
Oh wait, sorry

2333
03:24:53,979 --> 03:24:56,780

03:31:10,420 --> 03:31:12,420
Okay, here we go, here's the new one

2397
03:31:19,500 --> 03:31:21,500
Starting us off nicely we have

2398
03:31:22,059 --> 03:31:30,309
Oh, I think I fucked it up. Oh shit. I fucked it up. No

2399
03:31:32,180 --> 03:31:37,639
No

2400
03:31:37,639 --> 03:31:46,680
Wait, okay. I got it. Okay. Here we go

2401
03:31:48,840 --> 03:31:50,840
No, no, no, no, it's wrong. It's wrong. It's wrong

2402
03:31:51,479 --> 03:32:02,280
God damn it. Stop. Why is it doing this? I'm trying to do the stupid reveal

2403
03:32:13,129 --> 03:32:19,989
All right, who cares? Here we go. Don't do that again. You're making me upset

2404
03:32:20,790 --> 03:32:23,860
Here we go

2405
03:32:23,860 --> 03:32:26,180
Okay. So is there bat poop in mascara?

2406
03:32:27,459 --> 03:32:29,459
What is bat poop used in?

2407
03:32:31,850 --> 03:32:34,489
Is there bat poop in energy energy drinks?

2408
03:32:37,370 --> 03:32:39,209
What is with bats?

2409
03:32:39,209 --> 03:32:41,450
Is the sodium guan like bat feces?

2410
03:32:43,770 --> 03:32:46,600
Gets better

2411
03:32:46,600 --> 03:32:48,600
Is bat poop a delicacy?

2412
03:32:54,360 --> 03:32:58,500
Where is guano found and by the way, is it toxic?

2413
03:32:59,860 --> 03:33:03,750
So I can eat it

2414
03:33:03,750 --> 03:33:05,750
How do you clean up bat poop?

2415
03:33:07,129 --> 03:33:11,450
How do you identify bat poop so I can eat it make sure it's not poisonous

2416
03:33:12,090 --> 03:33:17,299
And then clean it up

2417
03:33:17,299 --> 03:33:22,979
Look at these

2418
03:33:22,979 --> 03:33:25,459
I this is not me. This is other people that somebody else wrote this

2419
03:33:27,700 --> 03:33:29,219
Can I eat it?

2420
03:33:29,219 --> 03:33:34,200
Where do I find it? Will it make me sick? How do I clean it up? And how do I know where it is?

2421
03:33:36,180 --> 03:33:43,799
in a row

2422
03:33:48,139 --> 03:33:50,139
Is it bat poop in Doritos?

2423
03:33:50,379 --> 03:33:51,979
Oh

2424
03:33:51,979 --> 03:33:54,700
I can't I have to play nancy drew

2425
03:33:59,700 --> 03:34:10,920
Let's go. Have you met dagny? What's his image? What are you talking about? Is it bat poop in the stream?

2426
03:34:11,079 --> 03:34:13,079
I know i've seen that image of my mouth

2427
03:34:15,590 --> 03:34:16,549
jeez

2428
03:34:16,549 --> 03:34:18,229
christ guys

2429
03:34:18,229 --> 03:34:24,120
Why do I keep looking up bat shit?

2430
03:34:24,440 --> 03:34:30,920
I know i've seen i've seen i've seen it. I've seen it. I've seen it. Crayola taste test when

2431
03:34:36,600 --> 03:34:38,600
Sounds like her

2432
03:34:39,799 --> 03:34:45,110
I've always tried to get information about magnus's flight apart. I'm not showing that on stream. It's gonna scare people. I'm so disorganized

2433
03:34:45,190 --> 03:34:48,549
I can't match my thought colors, let alone keep records of magnus's charting

2434
03:34:48,709 --> 03:34:54,469
She always wanted to know when he'd be gone. I never told her obviously. What was she trying to do in his absence?

2435
03:34:54,870 --> 03:35:01,770
No clue, but I imagine how fucked up we've gotten as a society

2436
03:35:03,260 --> 03:35:07,979
Imagine how that explains why she's been hanging around. We have become

2437
03:35:10,010 --> 03:35:12,229
Were you as a person?

2438
03:35:12,229 --> 03:35:17,590
Are sitting somewhere and you need to look up if there is bat shit in your food

2439
03:35:23,100 --> 03:35:25,100
How did we get here?

2440
03:35:32,389 --> 03:35:34,309
I just was curious today

2441
03:35:34,309 --> 03:35:36,309
Am I eating animal shit?

2442
03:35:37,059 --> 03:35:48,139
I might be that's why i'm concerned to look what did you mean by daily logs earlier?

2443
03:35:48,379 --> 03:35:55,180
There are these logs i'm supposed to fill out whenever a vessel passes through us. So are they filled out kind of I turn

2444
03:36:04,780 --> 03:36:07,340
It's better than the old days when you ate bat shit

2445
03:36:07,819 --> 03:36:11,739
Versus guessing if it might be trace amounts in your food. I

2446
03:36:17,420 --> 03:36:20,860
That is kind of true. How cool are we talking?

2447
03:36:28,459 --> 03:36:31,399
What do you mean my thumbnail

2448
03:36:44,299 --> 03:36:48,819
What do you know about soren that guy who runs the festival yes

2449
03:36:50,840 --> 03:36:55,399
Always seems like there's something just under the surface with that one cheerful and yet angry

2450
03:36:56,889 --> 03:37:01,209
Like he was holding something back. They say show the link for the vod. Oh my god

2451
03:37:06,629 --> 03:37:08,629
Who even is this character?

2452
03:37:08,709 --> 03:37:16,500
I don't even know who this is

2453
03:37:16,500 --> 03:37:22,020
No, that's scary. I'm not showing that one. You'll have to find that one. It's somebody from monsters inc

2454
03:37:23,319 --> 03:37:26,040

03:38:07,620 --> 03:38:13,340

2473
03:39:19,459 --> 03:39:21,459
I've never seen this movie. I don't know what it says

2474
03:40:00,469 --> 03:40:14,219
How would you even

2475
03:40:14,219 --> 03:40:17,739
Uh, we have to play after this. It's so cute. Why is it so big?

2476
03:40:21,610 --> 03:40:24,489
It's it sucks his lips up

2477
03:40:49,209 --> 03:40:51,209

2478
03:40:51,209 --> 03:40:55,049
I actually just need

2479
03:40:55,850 --> 03:41:01,690
Have you been talking on the phone for like 30 minutes? What can you tell me about? I just don't even totally

2480
03:41:02,010 --> 03:41:04,010

Updated it's called ship facts want to hear about it. I sure I guess sure educate me. Well, sure

2483
03:41:31,750 --> 03:41:43,930
Why is that try bringing it like an english sailor with no formal education?

2484
03:41:48,709 --> 03:41:52,149
Please look up more bat shit facts. Hey, that's pretty neat

2485
03:41:54,069 --> 03:41:58,149
I paid 450 channel points for this and there are no refunds

2486
03:42:00,100 --> 03:42:03,379
Can I hear another ship fact? How about this before?

2487
03:42:03,459 --> 03:42:08,180
1865 captains sometimes had difficulty finding people interested in joining their crew

2488
03:42:08,579 --> 03:42:10,100
So they just started kidnapping them

2489
03:42:10,100 --> 03:42:12,659
They pay a big guy to go around a popular harbor

2490
03:42:12,899 --> 03:42:18,260
Not young men unconscious and not wake them up until they were far out that shit facts another shit fact

2491
03:42:19,059 --> 03:42:25,299
One particularly evil press gang or even threw himself a fake birthday party specifically to attract kidnapping victims

2492
03:42:25,700 --> 03:42:30,659
Of course justice was served when he himself was press ganged a few years later. I have a crush on this intern

2493
03:42:30,659 --> 03:42:32,659
What are you talking about? I'm out of here

2494
03:42:35,110 --> 03:42:39,030
No, i'm not putting the image of the scary one up i'm not putting the scary image up

2495
03:42:40,500 --> 03:42:44,340
No, you'll have to find that one. Baud watcher is good luck. Find that one. It's scary

2496
03:42:47,780 --> 03:42:49,780
Not quite. No, no, where's the blogging?

2497
03:42:50,340 --> 03:42:52,340
I'm gonna go to the lighthouse

2498
03:42:53,479 --> 03:42:55,479
Lighthouse lighthouse. I got it. I got it. I got it

2499
03:42:58,489 --> 03:43:00,489
All right, where's how do I get to the lighthouse?

2500
03:43:04,260 --> 03:43:06,260
Where's the light

2501
03:43:06,420 --> 03:43:10,899
It looks like the original hell someone made off with some of the decorations though

2502
03:43:12,870 --> 03:43:18,180
Uh an egg

2503
03:43:18,180 --> 03:43:29,239
I don't know

2504
03:43:29,239 --> 03:43:31,239
All the elements and a gun

2505
03:43:36,819 --> 03:43:37,940
turn

2506
03:43:37,940 --> 03:43:40,860
turn

2507
03:43:40,860 --> 03:43:45,340
Show image now show I wouldn't even have suckered puzzles. I haven't even done one in like 40 minutes

2508
03:43:45,340 --> 03:43:47,340
We've been too busy looking up bat facts

2509
03:43:47,979 --> 03:43:49,979
All right, I need to get to the lighthouse

2510
03:43:50,059 --> 03:43:55,110
How do I get to the lighthouse from here?

2511
03:43:57,639 --> 03:43:58,760
fuck

2512
03:43:58,760 --> 03:44:02,520
Prepare the lighthouse find and return the helms missing decorations

2513
03:44:03,159 --> 03:44:10,840
Figure out the sounding depth numbers search for clues. Check out the cabin outside of town find a light to use in the ice caves

2514
03:44:12,170 --> 03:44:13,930
Oh, I still have to do that

2515
03:44:13,930 --> 03:44:20,090
That's done. Can't check that off yet. Get in. Okay, can't check that off yet. Still have to do that. What?

2516
03:44:27,540 --> 03:44:30,420
What the how do I do anything?

2517
03:44:31,219 --> 03:44:35,620
If this section of the original ship was removed then maybe others were too

2518
03:44:40,389 --> 03:44:46,379
That was pointless

2519
03:44:46,379 --> 03:44:47,739
dude, I

2520
03:44:47,739 --> 03:44:49,819
I seriously I can't where am I supposed to go?

2521
03:44:50,780 --> 03:44:54,250
Go to the lighthouse

2522
03:44:54,250 --> 03:44:58,649
That image is fucked up. I know why do you think I don't want to show it because it's actually terrifying

2523
03:45:04,489 --> 03:45:06,420
Yeah

2524
03:45:06,420 --> 03:45:08,579
Elizabeth seems like she's withholding information

2525
03:45:09,459 --> 03:45:15,139
She still seems pretty intense about magnus as far as I can tell and she thinks the treasure belongs to her

2526
03:45:15,620 --> 03:45:17,620
I've seen some exes do some German

2527
03:45:18,500 --> 03:45:25,540
Looks like the other mother from core line. That's why when I end a relationship, I just move to a different continent and change

2528
03:45:26,739 --> 03:45:29,219
What?

2529
03:45:29,219 --> 03:45:31,219
Uh-oh

2530
03:45:41,590 --> 03:45:47,799
Fuck yeah. Yep

2531
03:45:54,739 --> 03:45:55,940
Yeah

2532
03:45:55,940 --> 03:45:59,780
My phone number so much easier than doing the whole breakup thing

2533
03:46:00,420 --> 03:46:02,819
That must be exhausting just quit the fucking game

2534
03:46:03,620 --> 03:46:07,700
I can't really do mailing addresses anymore quit the game. I'm

2535
03:46:10,420 --> 03:46:14,100
Make the game larger the game is it's from I can't

2536
03:46:14,899 --> 03:46:16,899
I can't okay. How do I?

2537
03:46:17,780 --> 03:46:19,620
I want solutions

2538
03:46:19,620 --> 03:46:21,700
I want solutions to problems

2539
03:46:22,500 --> 03:46:28,979
What do I do the egg?

2540
03:46:28,979 --> 03:46:31,299
The drew crew is just getting started. That's right

2541
03:46:33,219 --> 03:46:35,059
Don't don't let any

2542
03:46:35,059 --> 03:46:37,219
Drew crew naysayers tell you

2543
03:46:38,100 --> 03:46:42,819
That with the way that we're done playing nancy drew are streaming on upset

2544
03:46:52,090 --> 03:46:54,170
Two games done 30 to go. That's right

2545
03:46:55,059 --> 03:46:56,950
He's crying

2546
03:46:56,950 --> 03:46:58,950
No, i'm not

2547
03:46:59,770 --> 03:47:01,770
Oh, this looks like a door

2548
03:47:01,770 --> 03:47:03,940
lighthouse

2549
03:47:03,940 --> 03:47:25,399
No, how's it what what has happened? What the fuck just happened? Why I can't go up

2550
03:47:26,040 --> 03:47:28,280
Well, I need to go to sleep

2551
03:47:28,440 --> 03:47:30,680
I have to go to bed

2552
03:47:30,680 --> 03:47:33,719
Right, remember she was like, oh, yeah, you got I gotta go to sleep now

2553
03:47:52,889 --> 03:47:57,500
How do you sleep in this game

2554
03:47:57,500 --> 03:48:00,520
It was doom

2555
03:48:00,520 --> 03:48:02,600
Can I go to bed speak up now?

2556
03:48:04,700 --> 03:48:06,700
Soren told me about your boat crash

2557
03:48:07,100 --> 03:48:09,100
He will pay for a wagon

2558
03:48:10,219 --> 03:48:12,219
Seinfeld

2559
03:48:15,899 --> 03:48:18,780
Do we still have do we still have drew supporters in the chat right here

2560
03:48:19,340 --> 03:48:23,180

2562
03:48:26,059 --> 03:48:33,420
Unfair means nothing you think because a culture is unfair. It will change for you. That is not the world

03:48:34,139 --> 03:48:36,620
That is not skip bro. Later

s r d uh

2603

Do I just have to put the pins just there? I guess I

2604
03:53:24,840 --> 03:53:28,760
e v f w m e that's not correct

2605
03:53:38,229 --> 03:53:40,229
e v s r d

2606
03:53:41,510 --> 03:53:44,069
S r this makes no sense. The order doesn't matter

2607
03:53:45,510 --> 03:53:47,510
e v f w m

2608
03:53:47,590 --> 03:53:53,399

D r s do that is not

2619
03:54:33,420 --> 03:54:37,559
Not cute

2620
03:54:37,559 --> 03:54:40,120
d r

2621
03:54:40,120 --> 03:54:43,139
This is one of the sounding numbers magnus was looking for

2622
03:54:43,860 --> 03:54:48,090
What the hell does this do for me 14?

2623
03:54:50,020 --> 03:54:52,020
86 14

2624
03:54:52,040 --> 03:55:00,659
Okay

2625
03:55:00,659 --> 03:55:05,340
Is that for the number wheel?

2626
03:55:07,350 --> 03:55:08,870
86

2627
03:55:08,870 --> 03:55:10,680
14

2628
03:55:10,680 --> 03:55:16,139
Didn't work

2629
03:55:16,139 --> 03:55:17,899
1486

2630
03:55:17,899 --> 03:55:26,149
Didn't work

2631
03:55:26,149 --> 03:55:28,469
8614 was that your iceland was discovered

2632
03:55:29,110 --> 03:55:43,620
That didn't even happen yet. What are you talking about? What are you saying is nonsense?

2633
03:55:49,159 --> 03:55:51,079
All right, i'm going to sleep

2634
03:55:51,079 --> 03:55:55,719
I know how to sleep. I have to go to the to the misty, uh, the misty mountain whatever it's called

2635
03:56:02,440 --> 03:56:09,340
Sleep sleep sleep illegal horn

2636
03:56:24,649 --> 03:56:28,809
If you want to sleep climb the stairs to the lodging floor and automatically wake up later

2637
03:56:32,040 --> 03:56:37,479
This is me waking up. Why did I need to sleep for?

2638
03:56:47,909 --> 03:56:51,270
Uh day two, this is like day 30. I've done this like a bunch of times

2639
03:56:59,399 --> 03:57:01,399
Did this walkthrough is

2640
03:57:01,719 --> 03:57:03,719
This walkthrough is so behind

2641
03:57:12,500 --> 03:57:14,500
He's cheating

2642
03:57:16,329 --> 03:57:27,909
I'm only cheating when I have to I have to play all three parts of that stupid ass story

2643
03:57:28,870 --> 03:57:32,469
That's not a stupid story. Is it a is it a dumb story? Is this like a made-up story?

2644
03:57:36,680 --> 03:57:38,680
Go outside the time. I can't go outside of town

2645
03:57:39,319 --> 03:57:55,239
Oh the cave

2646
03:57:55,239 --> 03:57:58,760
These caverns can be accessed directly from skip bro and are open for tours

2647
03:58:11,299 --> 03:58:13,379
Skip, okay. What does this mean?

2648
03:58:14,180 --> 03:58:17,590
What do I do with this info? I don't know

2649
03:58:19,510 --> 03:58:21,510
You're addicted to enancy true

2650
03:58:22,229 --> 03:58:25,750
I just want to see the end. No, I don't I just want to see like halfway through

2651
03:58:26,940 --> 03:58:32,309
Yeah, it's mostly halfway through

2652
03:58:32,309 --> 03:58:34,309
Then you got this guy getting new info

2653
03:58:34,629 --> 03:58:43,020
What's your relationship like with elizabeth presently quite poor? She won't allow certain

2654
03:58:44,329 --> 03:58:49,850
Members of the restoration team to access their work you mean dagny. Yes, but

2655
03:58:50,409 --> 03:58:55,530
Overall, she's quite a peach that one the only one who's ever shown me kindness

2656
03:58:56,090 --> 03:58:58,090
And the other half is happening tomorrow

2657
03:58:58,889 --> 03:59:01,129
I don't I I don't think we're doing too

2658
03:59:02,569 --> 03:59:06,569
Rocked the local mountains to their very core. I wonder if he's checked his voicemail since

2659
03:59:07,450 --> 03:59:09,530
Play ai dungeon now. I was planning on it

2660
03:59:10,489 --> 03:59:14,649
Did you lock magnus's cabin yes

2661
03:59:15,209 --> 03:59:20,969
No one should be going in there until the authorities search everything. Why not call the police believe me?

2662
03:59:20,969 --> 03:59:25,209
I want to but I live life one step away from an angry mob on my doorstep

2663
03:59:25,290 --> 03:59:27,850
Why do you think I stay in the culture center don't do tomorrow?

2664
03:59:29,420 --> 03:59:31,819
Ai dungeon tomorrow. Yeah, I guess sure

2665
03:59:33,100 --> 03:59:37,770
Well, you guess you could lie about it. You said two drew streams after jump night

2666
03:59:38,729 --> 03:59:40,729
That's that's correct still

2667
03:59:45,350 --> 03:59:51,350
So you're afraid to contact the police and no one else will it's less that i'm terrified and more than

2668
03:59:52,389 --> 03:59:57,909
Actually, yes, i'm terrified in these parts vigilante efforts are very much the norm

2669
03:59:58,389 --> 04:00:04,549
Even if the nancy drew dungeon, no one would talk. I hate to admit it, but it's up to us to crack this case. That sounds fun

2670
04:00:07,209 --> 04:00:08,329
Bye-bye

2671
04:00:08,329 --> 04:00:11,690
All right. I gotta let me let me go back to the uh, let me go back to the instruments

2672
04:00:12,569 --> 04:00:14,569
I gotta get that seinfeld theme, correct?

2673
04:00:33,209 --> 04:00:41,059
Where i'm looking for a uh, hold on a minute here. I'm just trying to take a look around the musical instruments

2674
04:00:41,700 --> 04:00:45,930
Just want to check something out real quick

2675
04:00:46,329 --> 04:00:59,700
Just want to quickly

2676
04:01:00,579 --> 04:01:06,979
Uh, I need to how do I open this I think I can open this

2677
04:01:16,790 --> 04:01:39,559
It should open why is it not opening why would it because i'm cheating and it says I can open it

2678
04:01:40,620 --> 04:01:42,620
That's a lang spill, right?

2679
04:01:44,489 --> 04:01:49,610
Open the lang spill

2680
04:01:49,690 --> 04:01:52,059
I can't open it

2681
04:01:54,020 --> 04:02:14,489
Yeah, what about it

2682
04:02:14,489 --> 04:02:18,889
Open the round case on the lang spill and see different pattern on each side of the decoration

2683
04:02:18,969 --> 04:02:21,129
This is the boomer strategy. The boomer guy doesn't work

2684
04:02:22,780 --> 04:02:25,780
Nancy doesn't know you can open it

2685
04:02:25,780 --> 04:02:26,739
What?

2686
04:02:26,739 --> 04:02:45,270
What do you mean nancy doesn't know you can open it. She doesn't know I have to know that I have to go get the

2687
04:02:46,379 --> 04:02:54,780
I did everything out of order from the guide. I haven't triggered that yet

2688
04:02:55,420 --> 04:02:57,979
I need to find a note

2689
04:02:57,979 --> 04:03:02,520
Where's this guy's note?

2690
04:03:02,520 --> 04:03:04,280
Okay, get the hook

2691
04:03:04,280 --> 04:03:07,639

04:03:52,819 --> 04:03:54,020
Get the key

2698
04:03:54,020 --> 04:03:57,459
Okay. Yeah sketch pieces crow's nest already did it

2699
04:04:01,299 --> 04:04:03,299
Go inside the wheelhouse. What the hell is that?

2700
04:04:05,670 --> 04:04:33,930
What's the wheelhouse?

2701
04:04:33,930 --> 04:04:36,090
All right, read the letters inside the box

2702
04:04:37,459 --> 04:04:45,590
Examine the box nancy says all the wooden sections should be pressed down inside that box there and there's letters in there

2703
04:04:46,309 --> 04:04:51,209
Let's go. Let's go read them

2704
04:04:51,209 --> 04:04:52,889

2705
04:04:52,889 --> 04:05:15,370
Better be where's that dumbass box? I'm not vibing

2706
04:05:16,649 --> 04:05:19,909
Are you kidding? Are you serious?

2707
04:05:19,909 --> 04:05:21,590
Hey nancy

2708
04:05:21,590 --> 04:05:24,149
What are you talking about? You're not vibing

2709
04:05:25,899 --> 04:05:27,350
I

2710
04:05:27,350 --> 04:05:29,909
You spend a lot of time. You're really fucking with my vibe here

2711
04:05:31,030 --> 04:05:33,030
If you're not vibing

2712
04:05:33,430 --> 04:05:36,469
In case of a ship emergency i'm responsible. You don't know what that means

2713
04:05:38,069 --> 04:05:39,670
No, you're right. I don't

2714
04:05:39,670 --> 04:05:40,870
What does it mean?

2715
04:05:40,870 --> 04:05:43,750
I actually don't know what the actual doesn't do

2716
04:05:46,149 --> 04:05:50,069
Two people are vibing is to say that they're enjoying each other's company and converse easily

2717
04:05:51,819 --> 04:05:54,940
I was saying it wrong. I thought like vibing means like you just like hanging out and chilling

2718
04:05:56,700 --> 04:06:00,139
Things break suddenly and it's hard to hear the alarm from the harbor

2719
04:06:00,540 --> 04:06:02,139
I see

2720
04:06:02,139 --> 04:06:04,139

04:06:42,010 --> 04:06:44,010
Why does everybody hide all this shit?

2728
04:06:45,260 --> 04:06:57,579
You like hiding hiding a picture of you and your dog. What are you doing? Is this where is it?

2729
04:06:59,270 --> 04:07:03,860
Where is it?

2730
04:07:03,860 --> 04:07:06,680

2731
04:07:06,680 --> 04:07:08,680
I already did this I have to do this again

2732
04:07:09,079 --> 04:07:27,780
They've all got to be they've all got to be depressed down. All right open give me these damn

2733
04:07:30,260 --> 04:07:32,180

Love you

2740
04:07:56,469 --> 04:08:03,719
Well, dude, if you did you you put them in a box behind a weird puzzle

2741
04:08:07,399 --> 04:08:11,639
Like if I want kim to look at in the lang spill i'm gonna just set texture and say hey honey

2742
04:08:11,719 --> 04:08:13,719
Look in the lang spill

2743
04:08:19,479 --> 04:08:21,559
It's like when me and kim want to go to dominoes

2744
04:08:22,659 --> 04:08:25,059
I don't just it's not like oh, hey kim, uh, by the way

2745
04:08:25,299 --> 04:08:29,780
I'd like for you to figure out here to open up my sphere of puzzles to see what I want you to do today

2746
04:08:40,069 --> 04:08:42,069
Cursed cursed cursed. You're welcome

2747
04:08:44,760 --> 04:08:48,860
What is this a new image? This link gives me a virus

2748
04:08:57,379 --> 04:08:59,459
I mean, I won't be I won't be clicking that one again

2749
04:09:00,940 --> 04:09:02,940
What okay? Yeah, the lang spill lang spill

2750
04:09:04,139 --> 04:09:05,180
lang spill

2751
04:09:05,180 --> 04:09:07,180
close close

2752
04:09:14,469 --> 04:09:17,750
Here we go. We got progress now. Thank you boomer gamers

2753
04:09:18,549 --> 04:09:28,629
There it is. It's subtle, but I see some differences in the halves of this pattern

2754
04:09:30,340 --> 04:09:32,340
Find the differences between the two mirrored sides

2755
04:09:35,030 --> 04:09:37,030
Now there's a lot. Okay, let's start at the bottom

2756
04:09:41,879 --> 04:09:47,100
Uh, there's three fingers

2757
04:09:47,100 --> 04:09:52,309
There is this one says no, okay. That's that one

2758
04:09:53,559 --> 04:09:55,559
um

2759
04:09:56,120 --> 04:10:48,180
There's no more

2760
04:10:48,180 --> 04:11:02,250
Cool a carved star. What am I supposed to do with that now? Oh, hey. Hey, Clarissa

2761
04:11:08,440 --> 04:11:22,659
Um, so what's this what's this? What was this one? What would I do now?

2762
04:11:23,940 --> 04:11:31,219
I'm just experiencing a walkthrough. No, nobody said that but I said that it's not what's going on. It's not what's going on

2763
04:11:36,540 --> 04:11:41,590
Let's go fix the dinghy motor

2764
04:11:41,590 --> 04:11:44,899
Somebody said boomer humor

2765
04:11:44,899 --> 04:11:48,899
You know boomer humor would be if I gave you like a quote from I love Lucy

2766
04:11:50,180 --> 04:11:52,180
Not Clarissa explains at all

2767
04:11:55,030 --> 04:12:01,620
What?

2768
04:12:01,620 --> 04:12:03,979
Let's fix this thing, huh?

2769
04:12:03,979 --> 04:12:09,930
Open it up

2770
04:12:09,930 --> 04:12:12,329
Okay. All right translate these first

2771
04:12:18,420 --> 04:12:20,420
Let's see. Where's that cool note?

2772
04:12:23,100 --> 04:12:28,790
Where's that cool note?

2773
04:12:28,790 --> 04:12:30,790
It's okay. I have it over here in the walkthrough

2774
04:12:35,299 --> 04:12:37,299
All right, so we need the voltage to be

2775
04:12:37,700 --> 04:12:43,340
um

2776
04:12:46,659 --> 04:13:00,360
What are you talking about do I

2777
04:13:06,729 --> 04:13:11,799
There it is I got the thing to translate voltage total

2778
04:13:13,739 --> 04:13:15,180
so there's my

2779
04:13:15,180 --> 04:13:18,219
My dinghy 16 9 19 13

2780
04:13:19,100 --> 04:13:22,170
I don't have any spark plugs

2781
04:13:22,409 --> 04:13:35,979
Will I open that thing?

2782
04:13:35,979 --> 04:13:40,360
I know what I have to do

2783
04:13:40,360 --> 04:13:46,870
Hello

2784
04:13:46,870 --> 04:13:48,870
Not quite yet need your help

2785
04:13:49,829 --> 04:13:56,299
What not quite yet

2786
04:13:56,940 --> 04:13:59,860
What the fuck are you talking about?

2787
04:14:32,090 --> 04:14:40,069
Where do you get this where the spark plugs guys find on page spark plugs

2788
04:14:40,549 --> 04:14:53,739
I don't I don't care about this. I know that I got a guy in the dru crew saying like I don't care

2789
04:14:54,760 --> 04:14:56,840
I mean, what I what do you want me to tell you?

2790
04:14:58,059 --> 04:15:00,059
You think i'm gonna walk around in circles to try to find?

2791
04:15:01,579 --> 04:15:03,979
The one place where this is

2792
04:15:04,459 --> 04:15:05,979
That

2793
04:15:05,979 --> 04:15:07,979
Who the fuck wow, what are you talking about?

2794
04:15:08,540 --> 04:15:17,819
What are they just in there?

2795
04:15:17,819 --> 04:15:19,659
Vote him out of the dru crew

2796
04:15:19,659 --> 04:15:23,899
That's fine. That's fine. I I you can get you can you can fire me from president of the dru crew

2797
04:15:24,860 --> 04:15:27,479
Whatever. I still get to show up

2798
04:15:28,120 --> 04:15:34,180
Are they just in here?

2799
04:15:41,239 --> 04:15:45,079
I have it right here. What are you talking about? These are the spark plugs use them

2800
04:15:46,040 --> 04:15:54,540
Nancy

2801
04:15:57,829 --> 04:16:03,139
What do you want me to do

2802
04:16:06,969 --> 04:16:08,889
It's right in front of me

2803
04:16:08,889 --> 04:16:17,290
The language barrier solved the puzzle. I apparently can't speak icelandish

2804
04:16:18,469 --> 04:16:29,799
So I can't do it open the motor place the spark plugs and connectors in their location. I can't even touch it

2805
04:16:33,239 --> 04:16:35,239
I can't touch this. It won't let me

2806
04:16:40,600 --> 04:16:43,079
I have to play the translate game. I'm serious

2807
04:16:51,319 --> 04:16:53,319
I have to go play the translate game

2808
04:16:54,809 --> 04:17:04,020
No, I don't

2809
04:17:04,020 --> 04:17:06,020
You need the guide from the gift shop

2810
04:17:06,180 --> 04:17:15,639
What the fuck is this?

2811
04:17:15,639 --> 04:17:17,719
Maybe if I save a little more

2812
04:17:24,709 --> 04:17:26,819
Why

2813
04:17:26,819 --> 04:17:28,819
in seven hells

2814
04:17:28,979 --> 04:17:30,579
Would you put

2815
04:17:30,579 --> 04:17:32,579
a make money

2816
04:17:32,739 --> 04:17:34,920
mini game in the game

2817
04:17:34,920 --> 04:17:37,639
but the only place for you to make money is to do

2818
04:17:39,139 --> 04:17:40,180
a

2819
04:17:40,180 --> 04:17:52,969
Minigame on a translator screen you guys want me to get the sword for seven thousand dollars. I have to sit here for like two hours

mobile

2823
04:18:20,100 --> 04:18:23,219

04:18:25,219 --> 04:18:53,190
All right, how much money do I need 1500 you could just learn

Hello, okay. So this is one two

2865
04:22:32,250 --> 04:22:34,329
I need numbers. I need numbers

2866
04:22:36,280 --> 04:22:39,399
So I need 16 the middle one. It's so where where is it?

2867
04:22:40,850 --> 04:22:43,350
16 9 19 13

2868

Nine so we get seven and two

2930
04:26:56,840 --> 04:26:59,340
Seven and two is nine

2931
04:26:59,340 --> 04:27:02,600
Let's go

2932
04:27:02,600 --> 04:27:04,600
All right. Now we need to make uh

2933
04:27:04,760 --> 04:27:06,440

2944
04:27:38,229 --> 04:27:39,829
Quit for a little while

2945
04:27:39,829 --> 04:27:43,450
There's literally 300 000 people in there and where

Can't check haven't can't still check haven't done that still can't

2953
04:28:25,620 --> 04:28:29,139
Imagine how much of a lazy motherfucker you have to be to not check these off automatically

2954
04:28:29,940 --> 04:28:33,219
Still have to do that. Have I not explored the ton of into every single place?

2955

the boat the crab

2966
04:30:08,540 --> 04:30:10,540
the nuclear launch

2967
04:30:14,100 --> 04:30:19,610
What else we got? I have to turn this place back on right?

2968
04:30:23,030 --> 04:30:28,200
Probably shouldn't have ran by everything. Um

2969
04:30:29,079 --> 04:30:30,200
Well

2970
04:30:30,200 --> 04:30:31,959
Shit guys

2971
04:30:31,959 --> 04:30:45,049
I think i'm stumped

2972
04:30:45,049 --> 04:30:48,500
Call the intern from what phone?

2973
04:30:51,479 --> 04:30:54,420
Wait

2974
04:30:54,420 --> 04:30:59,350
Oh this phone

2975
04:31:00,469 --> 04:31:02,469
Okay, i'm in the lighthouse

2976
04:31:17,700 --> 04:31:19,700
Finally a real puzzle

2977
04:31:22,920 --> 04:31:26,870
Okay

2978
04:31:26,870 --> 04:31:29,909
I need to create white light to get the lighthouse running again

2979
04:31:30,629 --> 04:31:39,079
What the fuck are you doing?

2980
04:31:39,079 --> 04:31:40,040
I

2981
04:31:40,040 --> 04:31:43,690
Am I playing tetris?

2982
04:31:44,840 --> 04:31:47,459
Green and green is red

2983
04:31:47,459 --> 04:31:50,409
and then red and

2984
04:31:50,809 --> 04:31:52,809
Is this just 20 at 2048?

2985
04:31:53,860 --> 04:31:55,420
and then

2986
04:31:55,420 --> 04:31:57,420
Green and then red and red

2987
04:31:57,819 --> 04:31:59,979
Is the wheel and the wheel and the wheel is

2988
04:32:00,700 --> 04:32:30,409
I'm not soft-locked. I've played i've played that game before

2989
04:32:31,930 --> 04:32:33,930
Actually guys, I played the original one

2990
04:32:39,180 --> 04:32:41,180
How many there's more than one?

2991
04:32:41,690 --> 04:32:46,750
I played threes. Yeah threes is the one that they made and then 2048

2992
04:32:47,549 --> 04:32:51,950
Just made another one and 2048 was like five million times more popular

2993
04:33:02,649 --> 04:33:04,970
I think it's fine if I let's see

2994
04:33:05,610 --> 04:33:11,560
What happens if I go left?

2995
04:33:11,560 --> 04:33:14,599
Yeah, I think you actually can't soft lock yourself. So I gotta be careful

2996
04:33:23,290 --> 04:33:25,930
Yeah, it's very soft lockable. It's soft lockable

2997
04:33:26,569 --> 04:33:40,009
Can I combine the two white?

2998
04:33:40,009 --> 04:33:47,310
No, you can't almost there

2999
04:33:47,549 --> 04:33:52,139
Just a few more lights

3000
04:33:52,139 --> 04:33:54,619
Bring this one up bring this one over

3001
04:33:55,580 --> 04:33:58,380

3002
04:34:05,849 --> 04:34:47,099
Two more I gotta get this shit over here two more. This is actually gonna get pretty tricky. I gotta be careful

3003
04:34:50,509 --> 04:34:52,349
Uh-oh i'm about to fuck it

3004
04:34:52,349 --> 04:34:54,650
I'm about to fuck it all up

3005
04:34:56,090 --> 04:34:58,729
No, no, no. Oh, I fucked it up

3006
04:34:59,209 --> 04:35:03,610
Oh god, I gotta do it all in one go. Shit. Okay. I know what to do. I know what they want me to do

3007
04:35:03,610 --> 04:35:15,150
I know what to do. I'm gonna be here for a while

3008
04:35:15,790 --> 04:35:39,200
Oh, it's idiot proof. How would you ever say this was idiot proof? What are you talking about?

3009
04:35:39,680 --> 04:35:57,919
Shit, this is an ipad game now

3010
04:35:59,599 --> 04:36:06,000
Koala brain stream, right? Yeah, you do it. Yeah, you do it you do it you get them all in one go you do it

3011
04:36:07,229 --> 04:36:20,439
You do it zebra, but zebras are zebra smart

3012
04:36:21,080 --> 04:36:47,720
I hope not that way. They're definitely not there's no way a zebra is smart easy. It's left right left right left right left

3013
04:36:48,880 --> 04:36:52,479
Why would I do that to make a little joke when i'm halfway there? Why would I do that?

3014
04:37:09,819 --> 04:37:13,099
I gotta get rid of these blue ones or i'm gonna be fucking screwed again

3015
04:37:14,299 --> 04:37:16,540
No, don't do it

3016
04:37:16,860 --> 04:37:29,040
No

3017
04:37:29,040 --> 04:37:38,330

3018
04:37:38,330 --> 04:37:47,439
ooh, ah

3019
04:37:47,439 --> 04:37:55,000
Show fuck I screwed it up. I think I can still salvage it. Oh, i'm in deep shit now

3020
04:37:55,479 --> 04:37:59,479
I'm in deep shit. Now. I fucked the whole thing up. No, I didn't not yet. Not yet

This is to get I'm getting two more after that

3025
04:38:40,430 --> 04:39:07,400
It's easy just left right left right left right. No, you were wrong

3026
04:39:29,069 --> 04:39:58,509
Smart clicks are you out of your mind?

3027
04:39:59,150 --> 04:40:03,369
Have I ever played 2048?

3028
04:40:04,599 --> 04:40:10,040
I just told you I played the original. Here's the difference

3029
04:40:10,680 --> 04:40:17,630
In 2048 you don't have to leave shit on the goddamn game board. You can combine things forever

3030
04:40:17,950 --> 04:40:42,840
I just told you I played the original

3031
04:40:44,299 --> 04:40:46,380
Why would I lie about playing the original?

3032
04:40:48,409 --> 04:40:50,409
2048's not even the original

3033
04:40:51,310 --> 04:40:53,310
It's threes dammit threes

3034
04:41:02,840 --> 04:41:09,360
He's played every ipad game. That's right. I have i've played every ipad game

3035
04:41:12,159 --> 04:41:41,400
I would know

3036
04:41:42,720 --> 04:41:55,599
This sucks

3037
04:41:55,599 --> 04:42:21,709
You gotta get rid of the blue. You gotta keep getting rid of blue. Get out of here. Come on

3038
04:42:27,709 --> 04:42:29,709
You're no longer part of the dru crew

3039
04:42:31,069 --> 04:42:33,790
You can't leave the dru crew

3040
04:42:37,599 --> 04:42:42,080
Hey, hey fellas he thinks he can leave the dru crew

3041
04:42:44,509 --> 04:42:45,470
Boy

3042
04:42:45,470 --> 04:43:57,119
Once you're in the dru crew you rent it for life. Fuck. It's okay. Fuck fuck

3043
04:44:05,959 --> 04:44:07,319
No

3044
04:44:07,319 --> 04:44:11,310
I need to go

3045
04:44:11,310 --> 04:44:13,610
Wait, I think I can still wait. Wait, wait

3046
04:44:14,169 --> 04:44:19,080
How are you supposed to get all of them? How are you supposed to get all of them?

3047
04:44:21,759 --> 04:44:25,040
All of them you're gonna get all of these things that like what?

3048
04:44:27,229 --> 04:44:33,150
Give me a fucking break. You're gonna get a you're gonna fill the whole board solve it already. I can't

3049
04:44:34,479 --> 04:44:36,159
Oh

3050
04:44:36,159 --> 04:45:20,650
It's all right. Everything's gonna be fine. Just go up stick to one corner

3051
04:45:32,200 --> 04:45:37,259
I'm on this i'm on the computer

3052
04:46:35,840 --> 04:47:01,279
I got it. Why did you have to spawn there of all places? Why'd you spawn there?

3053
04:47:02,110 --> 04:47:05,630
Why did it spawn there you spawned? It's a bad place

3054
04:47:05,950 --> 04:48:04,909
I fucking hate this

3055
04:48:04,909 --> 04:48:06,909
Why does it have to be like this?

3056
04:48:07,689 --> 04:48:39,549
The game that they copied to do this is not even like this last game I don't even oh my god

3057
04:48:39,630 --> 04:48:40,830
I don't even

3058
04:48:40,830 --> 04:48:45,169
I don't even I don't I don't want to play the like the impossible version of 2048

3059
04:48:56,759 --> 04:48:58,680
Fucking nancy dru

3060
04:48:58,680 --> 04:49:09,439
Remember when this was a nancy dru stream remember when nancy dru made 35 games and

3061
04:49:10,060 --> 04:49:12,060
27 of them were terrible

3062
04:49:12,080 --> 04:49:14,080
Remember that I remember that

3063
04:49:23,310 --> 04:49:25,069
You take that back

3064
04:49:25,069 --> 04:49:48,540
And he lost his job as a streamer

3065
04:49:48,700 --> 04:49:53,900
For doing it because everyone put the dru crew left. You know how many actual dru crew fans there were zero

3066
04:49:57,119 --> 04:50:04,380
Streamer can't beat game for little girls

3067
04:50:09,759 --> 04:50:11,759
That's not even accurate

3068
04:50:12,380 --> 04:50:14,810

So you were doing wrong 30 percent of you were clicking the shiny button on the screen

05:21:25,599 --> 05:21:28,720
So sure like like 38 percent of you guys knew what you were doing

3305
05:21:29,360 --> 05:21:31,360
And the rest of you could just be lumped in with me

Six and three is nine

How would I rate this stream from a one out of ten?

3334
05:23:57,500 --> 05:24:01,360
ten

3335
05:24:01,360 --> 05:24:06,080
Uh four plus three, but I can't move 13. This has to act somebody said small numbers at the bottom

3336
05:24:06,720 --> 05:24:09,119
It's not true because I need to make 13

3337
05:24:16,009 --> 05:24:17,689
I had it correct

3338
05:24:17,689 --> 05:24:19,209

Start at the top

05:24:43,290 --> 05:24:45,290
Why would I start at the top 36 and

05:25:38,000 --> 05:25:40,000
There's 36 46 56

3357
05:25:40,720 --> 05:25:44,959
57 58 59 60 61 62 63. I need 27

3358
05:25:45,840 --> 05:25:47,840

3363
05:26:02,080 --> 05:26:04,799
We have 13 plus 13 23 9

3364
05:26:05,919 --> 05:26:08,959
And then we have 9 10 11 12 13 14 is 5

3365
05:26:10,080 --> 05:26:15,549
Oh 9 10 11 12 13 14 is 5. There's no 5

3366
05:26:18,880 --> 05:26:22,000
14 is 11 and uh

05:26:22,959 --> 05:26:24,959
11 and 3

3368
05:26:25,919 --> 05:26:27,919
Okay, so now we got um

3369
05:26:28,400 --> 05:26:32,029

05:26:45,310 --> 05:26:48,349
What was it six and no seven?

3376
05:26:48,909 --> 05:26:51,790
Seven seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirty. No, that's not correct. So eight

3377
05:26:52,750 --> 05:26:54,750
Nine was nine nine

3378
05:26:55,549 --> 05:26:57,790
Nine ten eleven twelve. That's thirteen. All right

3379
05:26:58,990 --> 05:27:02,669
Thirteen eight nine ten eleven twelve thirty. We need four. I got a four right here

3380
05:27:03,310 --> 05:27:07,630
Now we got five that doesn't equal that that doesn't make any sense. That's not correct. This is incorrect

3381
05:27:07,709 --> 05:27:09,709
I need the two over here. No, this is wrong

3382
05:27:10,509 --> 05:27:11,790

five and four is

3385
05:27:20,540 --> 05:27:21,819
Is there a zero?

3386
05:27:21,819 --> 05:27:24,750
replace 22

3387
05:27:24,750 --> 05:27:26,750
13 and five don't make 22

3388
05:27:27,450 --> 05:27:30,650
No, that's correct. So not 13 9 10 1 2 13 14

05:27:45,819 --> 05:27:47,819
5 and then 3 5 6 7 8

3396
05:27:50,909 --> 05:27:55,639

3405
05:28:54,090 --> 05:28:57,020
Yeah, good image

3406
05:28:57,020 --> 05:29:01,439
It's basic matte. I don't care

3407
05:29:01,439 --> 05:29:03,599
It was wrong. Don't use it. It was wrong

3408
05:29:07,119 --> 05:29:09,000
What?

3409
05:29:09,000 --> 05:29:11,310
You guys got it wrong too, then

3410
05:29:12,840 --> 05:29:14,840
All right, 63 26. Okay, let's go

3411
05:29:16,729 --> 05:29:18,330
22 14

3412
05:29:18,330 --> 05:29:22,220
Uh, nine five eight

3413
05:29:26,619 --> 05:29:28,939
Six seven two three five six

3414
05:29:30,459 --> 05:29:36,380
Seven two three five. There it is. It was correct. Don't tell me it was wrong. It was right

3415
05:29:40,349 --> 05:29:43,869
Show this to future germo. Okay, what is it?

3416
05:29:45,720 --> 05:29:47,720
All right, you got it. I think i'm gonna go

3417
05:29:47,880 --> 05:29:53,479
All right, you got it. I think i'm gonna go get that coin. Can I like fucking scoop slam him and take over his place?

3418
05:29:54,360 --> 05:30:03,360
I don't get it

3419
05:30:03,360 --> 05:30:07,279
Like I don't care. I if i'm the new germa that guy germa if you're listening to me in the future

3420
05:30:07,360 --> 05:30:09,360
Just come do it and be the germa. That's fine

3421
05:30:16,009 --> 05:30:24,439
What an accident show that to sober germa

3422
05:30:25,400 --> 05:30:32,360
Haven't still still can't check still haven't that's still have to can't check that off yet

3423
05:30:33,689 --> 05:30:43,720
Now what?

3424
05:30:43,720 --> 05:30:47,159
Can I hear another ship fact? I don't know. I don't know the ship fact

3425
05:30:47,159 --> 05:30:49,959
Most people think all pirates were men, but that's not true at all

3426
05:30:50,200 --> 05:30:55,000
In fact, there were dozens of famous lady pirates in the 16th and 17th centuries fix the game

3427
05:31:06,889 --> 05:31:12,569
After her mother died and her father was killed she became one of the most feared pirates in the caribbean at one point

3428
05:31:12,650 --> 05:31:14,650
She faked her own death during a battle

3429
05:31:14,650 --> 05:31:19,689
She went undercover and pretended to be a man for years when she finally revealed her true identity

3430
05:31:20,009 --> 05:31:26,009
Other pirates gave her the nickname back from the dead red because of her bright red hair bad feces facts

3431
05:31:26,490 --> 05:31:27,610
later

3432
05:31:27,610 --> 05:31:30,009
Talk to you later. Bye. What do I do now?

3433
05:31:30,970 --> 05:31:34,560
Okay, I had to turn this on so somebody could

3434
05:31:35,849 --> 05:31:41,000
I don't remember. I don't know you like I know what this what's going on right now

3435
05:31:46,040 --> 05:31:50,509
Back to the ship. All right, right, right, and then I got a call

3436
05:31:55,229 --> 05:31:57,229
Back to the back to the radio room

3437
05:31:59,560 --> 05:32:17,610
You got it. Goodbye. Do you remember more? I'm not gonna say that because I don't get it. All right, uh, now what?

3438
05:32:18,650 --> 05:32:24,439
Who wanted me to turn the lighthouse on in the first place? Didn't she want to do that?

3439
05:32:26,400 --> 05:32:56,110
Why would you have a chair alarm? Does it why does it what are you doing? Oh her back her bag. I can take her back

3440
05:32:56,830 --> 05:33:01,229
This must be the key to mangas's cabin. I'll just be borrowing this

3441
05:33:01,869 --> 05:33:05,520
Elizabeth never opened her gift

3442
05:33:06,080 --> 05:33:08,080
I don't remember one notes

3443
05:33:14,680 --> 05:33:18,919
All right. I got the key to the cabin. It's that door right there. Right the one that she was like don't go in there

3444
05:33:19,720 --> 05:33:33,520
Where's this in here? Open it. That's not the

3445
05:33:35,159 --> 05:33:37,310
That's not a cabin

3446
05:33:37,310 --> 05:33:41,720
This is not a cabin

3447
05:33:43,840 --> 05:33:51,360
How is that not a cabin the cabin is in

3448
05:33:54,169 --> 05:33:57,950
log cabin

3449
05:33:58,590 --> 05:34:06,459
Figure out what the lock in the cupboard opens. Why does it want me to still do this? Check that off yet. I don't understand

3450
05:34:07,180 --> 05:34:10,590
What the oh

3451
05:34:10,590 --> 05:34:54,110
Right. Wait one. There's only four numbers. I know there's probably more

3452
05:34:55,259 --> 05:34:58,939
All right, find it and return the helm's missing decorations. What the hell does that mean?

3453
05:34:59,419 --> 05:35:12,110
All right, let me I gotta find this cabin. Let's address the cheating see what it says

3454
05:35:28,299 --> 05:35:35,040
Okay

3455
05:35:35,040 --> 05:35:43,080
I know what to do. Are we underwater?

3456
05:35:45,529 --> 05:35:47,529
Can I get the fuck out of here?

3457
05:35:58,459 --> 05:35:58,700
All right

3458
05:35:58,700 --> 05:36:01,500
I have to go to the guy's cabin is you guys were right

3459
05:36:02,189 --> 05:36:07,389
There actually is a way to go a different way from the snowmobile you're right

3460
05:36:09,560 --> 05:36:15,310
I could go this way

3461
05:36:19,630 --> 05:36:31,150
I thought I could before the cave there was a place to go left. Where is it left on the road?

3462
05:36:32,509 --> 05:36:36,599
Oh, that's no sign

3463
05:36:45,049 --> 05:36:58,270
Just a little why oh no checking in something's wrong tell me

3464
05:36:58,990 --> 05:37:08,119
Izzy everything's fine. Everything's normal. I'm just not vibing with you. I'm just getting a strange vibe. No

3465
05:37:09,799 --> 05:37:11,799
He sent a hit man

3466
05:37:13,930 --> 05:37:15,930

3467
05:37:19,000 --> 05:37:26,200
Is someone trying to hurt you? Oh, no, dude

3468
05:37:27,560 --> 05:37:30,090

05:37:30,090 --> 05:37:33,439
Ned ned what on earth is going on?

3470
05:37:34,560 --> 05:37:37,369
Come on, leave me alone

3471
05:37:39,400 --> 05:37:41,400
New content new content

3472
05:37:43,389 --> 05:37:45,130
buttons

3473
05:37:45,130 --> 05:37:47,770
Ooh, I know what these do too. I had a ten buttons

3474
05:37:58,880 --> 05:38:00,880
Nancy, why am I on the cover of this?

3475
05:38:00,880 --> 05:38:05,869
Am I in my own universe? I don't understand

3476
05:38:06,509 --> 05:38:09,130
I got some edits. I want you to do

3477
05:38:09,529 --> 05:38:11,930
ooh buttons

3478
05:38:11,930 --> 05:38:24,279
What about bed? I need ten of these. I wonder what these images are for

3479
05:38:28,619 --> 05:38:34,639
Oh wait

3480
05:38:34,639 --> 05:38:35,840
nah

3481
05:38:35,840 --> 05:38:36,880
cares

3482
05:38:36,880 --> 05:38:39,240
Not worth it

3483
05:38:39,240 --> 05:38:41,240
Locked up tight locked up tight

3484
05:38:41,639 --> 05:38:43,639
Do I have like a hook?

3485
05:38:44,279 --> 05:38:46,060
Locator

3486
05:38:46,060 --> 05:38:49,360
Star

3487
05:38:49,360 --> 05:38:51,360
Okay, I can't open this it's making a weird noise

3488
05:38:54,439 --> 05:39:01,959
These must belong with that reference. I saw earlier four of each color down and across no three together in a line four

3489
05:39:08,759 --> 05:39:10,759
Are you what is going on?

3490
05:39:11,310 --> 05:39:13,310
four of each color

3491
05:39:13,709 --> 05:39:20,590
You know in range of crystals according to the note about crystals four colors of each crystal in a row and column

3492
05:39:33,979 --> 05:39:44,700
Ah

3493
05:39:44,700 --> 05:39:48,060
I did just yawn. I did. Yeah, you caught me you did

3494
05:39:50,090 --> 05:39:51,369
damn it

3495
05:39:51,369 --> 05:39:56,490
He's bored. No, I just i'm tired about that

3496
05:39:58,279 --> 05:40:00,009
so

3497
05:40:00,009 --> 05:40:03,450
Four I have to go of each color go. What does the dumb note say?

3498
05:40:14,889 --> 05:40:17,369
Chat just do it. There's no way a human could do it

3499
05:40:21,479 --> 05:40:25,639
No true dru crew member would yawn at a nancy dru game

3500
05:40:26,680 --> 05:40:29,979
Why do I hate nancy dru? I don't

3501
05:40:31,950 --> 05:40:33,549
Why I don't

3502
05:40:33,549 --> 05:40:37,099
Let me see if I can figure this out

3503
05:40:37,099 --> 05:40:42,220
Four have to go across

3504
05:40:42,459 --> 05:40:49,919
If I go to these two down here, wait, hold on you need four of each in

3505
05:40:50,319 --> 05:40:57,400
So that means like they give me you don't have to be in a row. I could do wait. Hold on

3506
05:40:58,040 --> 05:41:09,799
Yeah, they don't have to be in a row

3507
05:41:19,819 --> 05:41:33,639
Yep, four. Okay, make them all blue then work backwards. I'm kind of i'm feeling it

3508
05:41:34,520 --> 05:41:36,040
I'm feeling it

3509
05:41:36,040 --> 05:41:38,569
I'm gonna do with rows

3510
05:41:38,569 --> 05:41:40,569
Okay, here we go. Let's go ready

3511
05:41:40,889 --> 05:41:48,250
That one's done

3512
05:41:48,250 --> 05:41:58,860
Okay, what about down? How am I doing on these rows? Is it fine?

3513
05:42:11,470 --> 05:42:14,430
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep

3514
05:42:20,090 --> 05:42:21,369
I'm almost done

3515
05:42:21,369 --> 05:42:23,069
I see hold on

3516
05:42:23,069 --> 05:42:44,439
Let's go

3517
05:42:59,419 --> 05:43:03,630
Okay

05:43:11,080 --> 05:43:13,080
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

3519
05:43:13,400 --> 05:43:14,680

I'm sorry. I just like punched you

3521
05:43:18,509 --> 05:43:20,509
This is beautiful

3522
05:43:38,810 --> 05:43:41,450
Now you're actually gonna help me to sleep now you turn it up. What do I need to do?

3523
05:43:42,169 --> 05:43:49,040
What does it who cares? What who met what does why does this matter?

3524
05:43:56,479 --> 05:44:23,069
No get out of this what am I supposed to do with this is there any key

3525
05:44:23,950 --> 05:44:30,729
You need to arrange these pieces to see what the full image looks like what pieces oh

3526
05:44:31,369 --> 05:44:33,369

3527
05:44:33,529 --> 05:44:35,770
Dude, all right. Let's go dru crew

05:44:52,279 --> 05:44:59,580
I need a top

3531
05:44:59,580 --> 05:45:02,009
What the fuck? It's pretty easy

3532
05:45:02,729 --> 05:45:04,959
Why can I move it?

3533
05:45:04,959 --> 05:45:06,959
I can only put shit on the bottom

3534
05:45:07,040 --> 05:45:28,619
This is a children six piece. I can't even place anything. I can only place it on the bottom

3535
05:45:29,180 --> 05:45:49,790
Oh, I can't do it. Yeah, I can't do that guys. It's not it's not completable

3536
05:45:51,020 --> 05:45:52,619

05:45:52,619 --> 05:46:30,720
How many more of these was this? Yeah, okay. Nice publishing agreement

3538
05:46:32,159 --> 05:46:38,360

We'll definitely call you back. Thank you

3541
05:47:05,450 --> 05:47:07,849
Probably should have raised this one

3542
05:47:09,470 --> 05:47:11,470
I don't know how to race

3543
05:47:12,159 --> 05:47:14,159
only accumulate

3544
05:47:17,119 --> 05:47:18,639
Crow's nest

3545
05:47:18,639 --> 05:47:22,080
This is this is it solution is to divide into groups of six

3546
05:47:22,639 --> 05:47:26,639
No group touching another attempt after the festival crowds die down

3547
05:47:27,599 --> 05:47:35,819
a dog bed

3548
05:47:35,819 --> 05:47:40,990
But no dog those dogs this thing probably stinks

3549
05:47:41,869 --> 05:47:44,590
You need to clean that

3550
05:47:44,590 --> 05:47:46,590
a spare luggage key, huh?

3551
05:47:47,869 --> 05:47:49,389

3552
05:47:49,389 --> 05:47:52,840

05:47:53,450 --> 05:47:55,770
Heltreguide for all to enjoy

3554
05:47:56,729 --> 05:47:59,450
Did you see this there's gonna be tourists crawling all over the thing

3555
05:47:59,450 --> 05:48:02,409
We need to move faster by the way your mutt like shiny things

3556
05:48:02,970 --> 05:48:06,490
Discover this a hard way when spare luggage came with missing yesterday briefly saw it in

3557
05:48:07,689 --> 05:48:10,889
Tumi's mouth, but he ran off of it. Can you keep an eye out for it?

3558
05:48:10,889 --> 05:48:15,930
I figured it's gonna go back one way or another I check wherever he spends a lot of time wear gloves p.s

3559
05:48:17,450 --> 05:48:25,759
luggage

What the hell is this dog toys?

3563
05:48:43,040 --> 05:48:46,259
This must be related to the note magnus left for himself

3564
05:48:49,159 --> 05:48:51,159
Oh, is it this thing?

3565
05:49:32,540 --> 05:49:37,979
Okay, it looks fine no dog next to dog

3566
05:49:42,569 --> 05:49:48,349
It's a little tricky, but you know, you gotta just punch your way at it

3567
05:49:48,990 --> 05:50:26,830
It's very tricky it is it's pretty tricky, how am I out of dogs? Oh, that's for amateur. Okay, I see

3568
05:50:28,700 --> 05:50:29,900

05:50:53,599 --> 05:50:56,319
You can do it. I tried it's only 45 minutes if you suck

3572
05:51:01,290 --> 05:51:05,529
Need to know you're with me that you're going to see this through just like we talked about when we started this project

3573
05:51:06,250 --> 05:51:09,119

You've always had my word

3576
05:51:13,790 --> 05:51:17,549
You still do no need for that. So, uh, so dagny is in trouble

3577
05:51:18,110 --> 05:51:23,259
Haven't done that you're in deep shit. I still need how many coins two more coins?

3578
05:51:24,220 --> 05:51:35,180
You see any I don't see any more coins

3579
05:51:39,209 --> 05:51:41,290
I see one one more coin. That's it

3580
05:51:43,799 --> 05:51:46,279
That looks like one up there. It's not how is that possible?

3581
05:51:49,130 --> 05:51:50,490
Where's the last coin?

3582
05:51:50,490 --> 05:52:01,119

Is there a coin anywhere?

3585
05:52:04,479 --> 05:52:06,639
There's one more hanging out somewhere where

3586
05:52:13,630 --> 05:52:15,150

3587
05:52:15,150 --> 05:52:18,029
Well last time kim was a mod. She banned like 200 people

05:52:29,360 --> 05:52:34,080
Checking the boy. There's a bathroom. Oh shit. There is a bathroom. Can I get in there?

3589
05:52:41,400 --> 05:52:44,119

3590
05:52:48,639 --> 05:52:51,119
Where's this last coin before I lose my mind?

3591
05:52:51,840 --> 05:52:57,549

3597
05:53:27,340 --> 05:53:29,340
What why did you say that?

3598
05:53:30,909 --> 05:53:34,029
All right. All right, but all right, but why did you say that?

3599
05:53:34,590 --> 05:53:39,549
We're supposed to be part of the dru crew together and you're gonna come at me with that kind of shit

3600
05:53:40,939 --> 05:53:42,840
Come on

3601
05:53:42,840 --> 05:53:50,939
We're in this together forever. It's true crew. I thought I guys I thought you guys have my back

3602
05:53:51,500 --> 05:53:57,709
I'm just gonna look up where the coin is. Who cares

3603
05:53:57,950 --> 05:54:15,979
Where's the coin? What do you mean cheating? It's not cheating if you don't see it

3604
05:54:17,389 --> 05:54:19,389
I'm really i'm getting directions

3605
05:54:19,389 --> 05:54:21,389
I well, it's that up there, but it's not

3606
05:54:23,369 --> 05:54:28,330
Give me a hint then

3607
05:54:28,330 --> 05:54:31,279
You can't go in the bathroom

3608
05:54:31,279 --> 05:54:33,279
Do you guys know where it is? I don't think you do

3609
05:54:35,680 --> 05:54:37,959
the box

3610
05:54:37,959 --> 05:54:47,119
There's nothing in the box left pocket

3611
05:54:48,080 --> 05:54:57,549
You know

3612
05:54:57,869 --> 05:54:59,869
Nancy dru would not approve of cheating

3613
05:55:00,669 --> 05:55:12,810
It's not cheating if you don't if I don't get caught what

3614
05:55:13,610 --> 05:55:15,610
What's on the lid of the box?

3615
05:55:21,610 --> 05:55:23,930
Go stand by the front door and check the ceiling light

3616
05:55:53,119 --> 05:55:56,159
I thought I made what noise you thought I made what noise?

3617
05:55:59,200 --> 05:56:01,200
Do the chest puzzle?

3618
05:56:01,610 --> 05:56:03,919
There is no puzzle

3619
05:56:04,479 --> 05:56:06,479
I can't do anything

3620
05:56:15,290 --> 05:56:17,130
This is easy

3621
05:56:17,130 --> 05:56:18,650
There's nothing to do

3622
05:56:18,650 --> 05:56:24,860
I'm just leaving i'm going somewhere else to do another part of the game

3623
05:56:30,349 --> 05:56:31,869
Check the door frame

3624
05:56:31,869 --> 05:56:42,330

3625
05:56:42,330 --> 05:56:46,169
Quick, please kim the the dru crew needs our cheese toasties

Those are so good haven't done that

3627
05:56:50,009 --> 05:56:52,569
Keyhole at the bottom of the box. I don't have a key

3628
05:56:53,290 --> 05:57:00,409
It's a luggage key

3629
05:57:00,409 --> 05:57:01,610
That doesn't work

3630
05:57:01,610 --> 05:57:11,790
Kim, please. I need my toasties

3631
05:57:13,130 --> 05:57:15,130
All right in the pre-stream chat earlier

3632
05:57:16,840 --> 05:57:19,080
She asked if I wanted any cheese toasties

3633
05:57:19,639 --> 05:57:23,000
and tomato soup she was just she was being funny and

3634
05:57:23,400 --> 05:57:25,400
And people think that that

3635
05:57:26,279 --> 05:57:28,279

05:57:36,700 --> 05:57:49,720
There's nothing on the shelf. I did this already. I'm just leaving. I don't give a fuck

3638
05:57:50,360 --> 05:57:59,099

3639
05:57:59,099 --> 05:58:01,099
Why would you even hide this shit?

3640
05:58:01,979 --> 05:58:05,240
It's not that's not even a puzzle

3641
05:58:05,319 --> 05:58:09,229
That's not a puzzle. It's padding

3642
05:58:09,310 --> 05:58:13,310
We need to as the dru crew. We need to know the difference. I'm sorry

3643

Get me the fuck out of this house. He's quitting nancy dru

3645
05:58:54,639 --> 05:58:59,119
I don't understand break through this ice with a sharp enough tool. Why didn't she say that before?

3646
05:59:00,750 --> 05:59:02,750
i've had this hook in my

3647
05:59:02,810 --> 05:59:04,810
Inventory, okay, that's

3648
05:59:08,680 --> 05:59:10,680
Why can't I quit you?

3649
05:59:11,229 --> 05:59:16,729
I don't know. I don't know but this this kind of looks like my colonoscopy images

3650
05:59:17,450 --> 05:59:28,680
without the ice

3651
05:59:28,680 --> 05:59:29,720
down here

3652
05:59:29,720 --> 05:59:43,369
Hello, now remember we did that colonoscopy and there was a little ladder in your colon

3653
05:59:46,169 --> 05:59:48,169
Somebody's in there. Somebody's living in there

3654
05:59:55,599 --> 06:00:12,169
Oh, I need those anything else down here. It's oil right here. Can I do anything with the oil? Uh,

3655
06:00:12,729 --> 06:00:17,790
Okay, i'm lost in my colon

3656
06:00:32,619 --> 06:00:34,779
Uh, okay

3657
06:00:34,779 --> 06:00:41,849
Well, I apparently I can die down here. All right. Well, I have is there anything else I need down here?

3658
06:00:47,290 --> 06:00:49,479
I can't break this one

3659
06:00:49,479 --> 06:01:07,340
Where am I? What the fuck is going on?

3660
06:01:08,680 --> 06:01:24,189
This is a maze

3661
06:01:24,189 --> 06:01:30,380
Okay, nancy, where do you suggest I go? Am I any service down here?

3662
06:01:31,580 --> 06:01:44,840
Nickerson unless you're a telemarketer or my older sister in which case you've reached no one because this number doesn't exist

3663
06:01:45,400 --> 06:01:49,639
For everyone else leave a message ned. Call me back. I'm worried

3664
06:01:52,250 --> 06:01:55,680
All right, so I take a selfie down here

3665
06:01:56,700 --> 06:01:58,700
To prove that I was down here

3666
06:02:00,970 --> 06:02:02,970
All right, I figure how do I get out of here?

3667
06:02:03,529 --> 06:02:05,680
Go up to the ladder

3668
06:02:05,680 --> 06:02:06,880
and then

3669
06:02:06,880 --> 06:02:08,639
Is it I can go this way?

3670
06:02:08,639 --> 06:02:19,790
Am I going the right way?

3671
06:02:19,790 --> 06:02:23,470
What is going on?

3672
06:02:23,470 --> 06:02:29,930
Uh a generator

3673
06:02:29,930 --> 06:02:46,490
How did I do that?

3674
06:02:46,490 --> 06:03:14,560
Okay, there's a ladder. There was the glove

3675
06:03:17,310 --> 06:03:28,889
That glove doesn't do anything. I looked at it already. Okay up the ladder. There's two ways to go

3676
06:03:29,369 --> 06:03:47,659
Where did I go last time? Did I go? Okay?

3677
06:03:48,380 --> 06:04:04,990
He's already down here. Is there anything else in here? I don't think there's anything in here. I'm just leaving

3678
06:04:06,569 --> 06:04:19,049
All right, pull me out. Get me out of this. Get me out of the colon. I have okay. I got those sketch pieces

3679
06:04:19,610 --> 06:04:37,200
New alien colon where what was the sketch thing right here, right? Where do I put them? Wait, wait

3680
06:04:37,759 --> 06:04:40,560
Uh, no memory. No, I there's

3681
06:04:43,360 --> 06:04:45,849

3686
06:05:06,299 --> 06:05:20,040
Do I need more sketch pieces or what?

3687
06:05:20,919 --> 06:05:37,130
That's not where that goes. I can't even place anything

3688
06:05:39,099 --> 06:05:40,700
I can't even pick this up

3689
06:05:40,700 --> 06:05:55,799
Didn't say overlapping. So why can I not put it down?

3690
06:06:05,770 --> 06:06:09,369
And I get it. I know I know you didn't know I had to do that either

3691

What do I do with this

3813
06:15:47,200 --> 06:15:48,880
Still have to do that

3814
06:15:48,880 --> 06:15:50,479

What is a gun whale?

3817
06:15:57,709 --> 06:16:06,569
So I have the locator now figure out the importance of the contents of the foot locker

3818
06:16:07,369 --> 06:16:10,000
Figure out what the lock in the cupboard it opens

3819
06:16:10,959 --> 06:16:15,119
Right. I still don't understand that one figure out the sounding depth numbers yet

3820
06:16:18,959 --> 06:16:20,959
No idea. What's the luggage?

3821
06:16:21,360 --> 06:16:24,299

3827
06:17:06,349 --> 06:17:29,389
Can I climb this?

3828
06:17:29,389 --> 06:17:30,349
um

3829
06:17:30,349 --> 06:17:36,700
I gotta start talking to people

3830
06:17:36,700 --> 06:17:41,419
I've got to figure like we've got new dialogue to have with people and why do I have this weird egg still?

06:17:49,959 --> 06:17:53,479
Hey, soren just saw someone take a sweater from the gift shop. Those are free, right? Hey, soren

3833
06:17:53,479 --> 06:17:57,400
I just saw someone take a sweater from the gift shop. Those are free, right?

3834
06:17:58,279 --> 06:18:01,639
No, all right. What am I eating tonight? You might want to look into that then

3835
06:18:02,279 --> 06:18:03,400
stop

3836
06:18:03,400 --> 06:18:05,080

3837
06:18:05,080 --> 06:18:07,080
Oh, it's your luggage. I'll be taking that

3838
06:18:07,799 --> 06:18:25,389

3839
06:18:26,430 --> 06:18:32,750
He'll be back soon. Take as long as you want. There's no way he'll be back soon. Hey, it's right. I saw the other glove new

3840
06:18:32,750 --> 06:18:36,240
There he was

3841
06:18:36,240 --> 06:18:38,240
Create volcanic winter

3842
06:18:38,479 --> 06:18:42,939
All right, buddy slow down

3843
06:18:42,939 --> 06:18:46,520
relax

3844
06:18:46,520 --> 06:18:48,759
Uh, what else over here?

3845
06:18:49,229 --> 06:18:54,990
Soren's desk note mentioned volcanic winter. Do these elements link up to that somehow earth?

3846
06:18:56,110 --> 06:19:02,110
And water equals glacier. I played this this is doodle god fire and air makes energy

3847
06:19:02,830 --> 06:19:06,029
energy and steam makes a geyser a glacier

3848
06:19:07,069 --> 06:19:10,439
a geyser

3849
06:19:10,439 --> 06:19:11,799
and steam

3850
06:19:11,799 --> 06:19:17,740
Okay, so now we need water

3851
06:19:18,479 --> 06:19:20,720
We need glacier and and um

3852
06:19:21,360 --> 06:19:25,020
Get this shit out of here

3853
06:19:25,020 --> 06:19:28,319
glacier and

3854
06:19:28,319 --> 06:19:29,680
energy

3855
06:19:29,680 --> 06:19:32,430
Is an erosion

3856
06:19:32,509 --> 06:19:36,619
A maelstrom

3857
06:19:36,619 --> 06:19:39,259
So I need to do uh, let's do fire water

3858
06:19:40,060 --> 06:19:42,060
earth glacier and energy

3859
06:19:45,439 --> 06:19:47,799
How about air and glacier?

3860
06:19:52,479 --> 06:19:54,479
Glacier and energy is erosion

3861
06:19:55,040 --> 06:19:57,040
steam and glacier is flood

3862
06:19:57,979 --> 06:20:01,580
Flood and geyser is a maelstrom flood and erosion is a maelstrom

3863
06:20:02,380 --> 06:20:04,380
flood and fire is is

3864
06:20:05,180 --> 06:20:08,349
Okay, cool

3865
06:20:08,349 --> 06:20:16,330
Let's get i'm gonna get these off

3866
06:20:16,330 --> 06:20:18,590
Let's do

3867
06:20:18,590 --> 06:20:23,310
Water and earth is glacier water and air is cyclone

3868
06:20:24,279 --> 06:20:25,880
water and fire

3869
06:20:25,880 --> 06:20:32,330
Steam water earth is glacier earth and air is desert

3870
06:20:33,610 --> 06:20:37,290
Earth and fire is lava and we've got them all in that category

3871
06:20:38,169 --> 06:20:39,919
lava

3872
06:20:39,919 --> 06:20:41,919
And energy is eruption

3873
06:20:43,180 --> 06:20:45,819
lava and steam is a geyser

3874
06:20:46,459 --> 06:20:48,459
Lava and desert is a rock

3875
06:20:48,779 --> 06:20:50,939
Lava and cyclone is rock

3876
06:20:51,659 --> 06:20:53,419
energy and lava

3877
06:20:53,419 --> 06:20:55,419
Energy and cyclone is flood

3878
06:20:55,900 --> 06:20:57,900
Desert and energy is dust cloud

3879
06:20:58,459 --> 06:21:00,939
Dust cloud and flood is a maelstrom

3880
06:21:01,900 --> 06:21:07,819
Eruption and dust cloud is volcanic winter. I will take it winter guest records

3881
06:21:23,049 --> 06:21:28,939
Why elizabeth haven't done that?

3882
06:21:29,500 --> 06:21:31,500
All right, somebody should probably read that

3883
06:21:33,840 --> 06:21:35,840
Hmm. Here's the luggage

3884
06:21:36,319 --> 06:21:40,779
Get that shit open. What do you got in here drew through take a quick look. Oh, yeah

3885
06:21:42,060 --> 06:21:43,099
Oh, yeah

3886
06:21:43,099 --> 06:21:45,099
Here is a landed sea

3887
06:21:45,580 --> 06:21:48,959
I'll probably need that at some point. Somebody will remember us. I'm gonna read that shit

3888
06:21:49,919 --> 06:21:52,080
All right, i'm ready

3889
06:21:52,080 --> 06:22:02,909
He's been gone for a really long time. What happened here?

3890
06:22:03,549 --> 06:22:05,959
Looks like there's been a struggle

3891
06:22:06,439 --> 06:22:14,139
It's dagny's phone, but where's dagny blood?

3892
06:22:14,939 --> 06:22:16,939
His password protected

3893
06:22:24,189 --> 06:22:52,029
Maybe note about this

3894
06:22:52,189 --> 06:22:59,439
The password is not true crew. Okay

3895
06:23:00,159 --> 06:23:03,020
I would know i'm in it

3896
06:23:03,020 --> 06:23:23,560
Does that work? I don't know what the phone is. I got bigger fish to fry here

3897
06:23:24,520 --> 06:23:36,959
Yes, guys, don't don't worry. I passed the fourth grade. I know it's not resident sleep or

3898
06:23:37,759 --> 06:23:48,400
Nancy. Hi, it's good to hear your voice

3899
06:23:54,669 --> 06:23:56,669
Why are you panicking? What?

3900
06:23:59,389 --> 06:24:01,389
Yeah, you gotta fuck off

3901
06:24:02,189 --> 06:24:07,849
It's kind of a sort of an intangible concept really when a guy like me begins ruminating

3902
06:24:08,090 --> 06:24:11,450
Let me tell you it can get pretty crazy up in the old noggin

3903
06:24:12,169 --> 06:24:14,250
Looking back on all the times we spent together

3904
06:24:14,650 --> 06:24:17,049
All those times you almost got seriously hurt

3905
06:24:17,610 --> 06:24:22,970
Like that one time you almost burned to death or that time when you almost got killed by that giant falling blade

3906
06:24:23,689 --> 06:24:25,689
Or on that raft in new zealand

3907
06:24:26,090 --> 06:24:31,130
Or that one thing with that mansion on fire. Jeez, what happened then? That's so non-sense

3908
06:24:32,959 --> 06:24:39,200
Well, oh maybe that one time that you almost burned to death, you know, I get lucky a lot and I kind of

3909
06:24:39,680 --> 06:24:43,599
Fall into things. Oh shit. Those are spoilers for other games that we're gonna play in the true crew

3910
06:24:44,080 --> 06:24:46,080
Future streams

3911
06:25:03,259 --> 06:25:08,139
Remember that time that you froze to death over fourth grade math twice. Yeah

3912
06:25:09,020 --> 06:25:13,180
Yeah, that's kind of funny that is funny that person said that's funny

3913
06:25:17,900 --> 06:25:35,849
Oh, i'm not sure how I feel ned i miss you okay i'll see you

3914
06:25:38,810 --> 06:25:44,319
Oh, I need to go to the cabin fucking yikes

3915
06:25:48,040 --> 06:25:51,319
Does net ever make an appearance in any of the games does he just die on the telephone

3916
06:26:03,470 --> 06:26:07,150
Why are they why are there two pieces of this? Why are there two pieces of this?

3917
06:26:08,189 --> 06:26:12,540
What is this two pieces of this for?

3918
06:26:28,349 --> 06:26:33,340
Oh, okay. I'm just gonna say why is this two pieces of this?

3919
06:26:34,139 --> 06:26:45,119
All right, this goes over here somewhere right there

3920
06:26:46,799 --> 06:26:48,799
Flower goes

3921
06:27:05,279 --> 06:27:10,779
It's over here somewhere it's over

3922
06:27:10,779 --> 06:27:12,779
Over here

3923
06:27:20,400 --> 06:27:22,569
Still missing pieces

3924
06:27:22,650 --> 06:27:24,650
stupid haven't done that

3925
06:27:25,610 --> 06:27:27,770
Haven't done that. All right, we're gonna find dagny

3926
06:27:29,040 --> 06:27:32,000
I still don't get what this thing is for. What is this for? We know

3927
06:27:33,759 --> 06:27:40,330
What do we do with the music box? I can't move metal pieces

3928
06:27:41,130 --> 06:27:42,729
They can't be touched

3929
06:27:42,729 --> 06:27:46,569
It's a puzzle dumbass

3930
06:27:47,529 --> 06:28:00,720
Well, some of you guys could do with some nice training some of you guys could do with a little bit of of nice training

3931
06:28:12,009 --> 06:28:19,180
You know what I mean? I know it's a puzzle

3932
06:28:19,979 --> 06:28:26,889
Don't you mean decency training?

3933
06:28:29,000 --> 06:28:31,000
Stupid fucking dumb fucking idiot

3934
06:28:31,400 --> 06:28:41,900
Idiot dumb fucking idiot

3935
06:28:41,900 --> 06:28:43,919
Okay

3936
06:28:43,919 --> 06:28:45,119
Let's go

3937
06:28:45,119 --> 06:28:54,090
What else is here?

3938
06:28:54,090 --> 06:28:58,650
Hello fiskeri. Do you have anything? How do you know elizabeth? How do you know elizabeth?

3939
06:28:59,130 --> 06:29:02,889
I've known her since she was a negative pre glimmer in her puppy's eye

3940
06:29:03,290 --> 06:29:10,330
Always had the local boys terrified. That was a new voice after again. She knows what she wants and heads put straight as an arrow

3941
06:29:10,889 --> 06:29:13,049
young men

3942
06:29:13,049 --> 06:29:15,049
Not so good with a woman like that

3943
06:29:15,610 --> 06:29:17,209
She's scary

3944
06:29:17,209 --> 06:29:20,650
I'm hungry. Oh, yeah, right. What what what what you guys think?

3945
06:29:23,610 --> 06:29:27,049
Still she lets me sleep on the official that's worth something

3946
06:29:27,529 --> 06:29:29,849
Did you know about her and magnus? No

3947
06:29:30,970 --> 06:29:32,970
We all did my fiskeri

3948
06:29:33,610 --> 06:29:36,169
She's toasties now. Not really unfortunately

3949
06:29:36,810 --> 06:29:38,810
No, this is good with waves. Not a bad idea

3950
06:29:40,409 --> 06:29:45,770
No skills to speak of he is. Um, how do you say it there? A runner he runs

3951
06:29:46,330 --> 06:29:50,169
Ouch. I'm glad he's not here. Let's vote on whether we should disband the drew crew

3952
06:29:51,049 --> 06:29:56,009
Now I can only speak the truth. This is the second time we've ever met. That was a side effect of shark bites

3953
06:29:56,490 --> 06:29:59,369
It is a curse. I bet that's not i'm not what?

3954
06:30:02,029 --> 06:30:08,270
I saw you taking a dinghy out fishing trip. You told me you gave up being on the water for good

3955
06:30:08,750 --> 06:30:14,189
It wasn't me. That sounded pretty good. My brother. Yeah, the other gunnar he um

3956
06:30:15,389 --> 06:30:16,430
gunner

3957
06:30:16,430 --> 06:30:19,000
Oh first that shark bite. I was

3958
06:30:20,569 --> 06:30:24,009
Looking for the treasure, but so far only empty hands

3959
06:30:24,810 --> 06:30:29,209
I think there's more to this story. Don't check me now girl the bull

3960
06:30:31,180 --> 06:30:32,380
Go

3961
06:30:32,380 --> 06:30:35,900
Not now

3962
06:30:35,900 --> 06:30:37,180
Not now

3963
06:30:37,180 --> 06:30:41,020
And fuck you. I have the treasure finder idiot

3964
06:30:41,819 --> 06:30:55,130
You're the dumb one

3965
06:30:55,130 --> 06:31:05,159
Uh, what do we do now?

3966
06:31:05,720 --> 06:31:15,209
Pete

3967
06:31:15,209 --> 06:31:20,159
What about you? Let's talk to you

3968
06:31:20,159 --> 06:31:23,099
Hey nancy

3969
06:31:23,099 --> 06:31:26,299
Uh, so you and soren work together you and soren work together

3970
06:31:26,939 --> 06:31:31,740
Yes, we both run the festival remove channel points I can't now i've already given to them

3971
06:31:32,299 --> 06:31:35,419
They dislike him. I'm definitely sensing some of that

3972
06:31:36,299 --> 06:31:38,299
Why not one of us?

3973
06:31:38,380 --> 06:31:40,939
He doesn't know our stories no shared memories

3974
06:31:41,900 --> 06:31:43,900
He mentioned that you've been kind to him

3975
06:31:45,500 --> 06:31:50,700
Being his friend has yeah, i'm gonna up the prices. Don't worry. You're either outside or inside in skip road

3976
06:31:51,340 --> 06:31:53,900
You cannot stand in the doorway. You will be driven out

3977
06:31:54,459 --> 06:31:58,700
We are not like great pick like a big city sounds like people are trying to get rid of him

3978
06:31:59,259 --> 06:32:04,220
Ruining the festival would be a great way to do that. Wouldn't it your words not mine?

3979
06:32:05,560 --> 06:32:10,939
Regardless, he is welcome in my home and that's my pub. I spent 5 000 points on a reverse tube

3980
06:32:11,580 --> 06:32:13,979
But I can offer a warm meal and a listening ear

3981
06:32:15,659 --> 06:32:20,860
Heard about the debt about the town's debt issues, I don't know what you're talking about

3982
06:32:21,020 --> 06:32:25,880
I have found some information in the culture center. So you

3983
06:32:26,680 --> 06:32:28,200
You want to gloat?

3984
06:32:28,200 --> 06:32:32,360
To chastise you can't you know these channel points to highlight an imger link of my mouth

3985
06:32:33,240 --> 06:32:35,419
Is that what you did?

3986
06:32:35,419 --> 06:32:37,419
Of course, it's joker

3987
06:32:37,740 --> 06:32:39,979
Yes, that's my fault

3988
06:32:40,299 --> 06:32:44,459
I won't sit here and defend myself. Why does every channel have points now twitch just put it through

3989
06:32:45,020 --> 06:32:46,380
And I was going to fix it

3990
06:32:46,380 --> 06:32:50,060
It is a new twitch feature that they have unlocked for I think a lot of people now

3991
06:32:50,700 --> 06:32:54,619
It just by default turns on and we gotta figure out what the hell to do with it

3992
06:32:55,500 --> 06:32:59,470
I'm really sorry to hear about year and magnus's breakup

3993
06:33:00,349 --> 06:33:06,430
It hardly matters anymore. I don't want to pry but if you want to talk about it, i'm here

3994
06:33:07,229 --> 06:33:11,069
Here's one for your case file. I've known magnus all my life

3995
06:33:11,630 --> 06:33:13,389
We dated four years

3996
06:33:13,389 --> 06:33:15,389
The winters are long and dark

3997
06:33:15,869 --> 06:33:21,150
We found each other in that darkness, but then he went through hard times

3998
06:33:21,790 --> 06:33:24,909
He became obsessed over the ship for a long time his world narrowed

3999
06:33:25,389 --> 06:33:26,669
Yeah

4000
06:33:26,669 --> 06:33:29,950
There was no room left for me. That's the end of it. Goodbye

4001
06:33:30,669 --> 06:33:31,869
Bye now

4002
06:33:31,869 --> 06:33:33,549
Bye

4003
06:33:33,549 --> 06:33:38,119
All right, get me

4004
06:33:38,119 --> 06:33:40,840
Where am I going? I don't know. What am I doing? I don't know

4005
06:33:41,799 --> 06:33:47,560
I don't know figure out the numbers figure out the numbers and go let me go back up

4006
06:33:49,000 --> 06:34:03,340
Am I gonna buy amd calls?

4007
06:34:06,400 --> 06:34:08,400
No, I don't fuck with the stock market anymore

4008
06:34:17,799 --> 06:34:20,479
Nothing's beyond me

4009
06:34:20,479 --> 06:34:26,159
Not since I was like it's there's no fucking way. It's gonna be that expensive

4010
06:34:26,880 --> 06:34:30,400
No way. It's so overvalued. It's not worth shit

4011
06:34:32,060 --> 06:34:33,659
And I was wrong

4012
06:34:33,659 --> 06:34:49,599
I want to get up to the crow's nest

4013
06:34:51,040 --> 06:34:52,880
Where's the crow's nest?

4014
06:34:52,880 --> 06:34:54,880
How do I get up to the crow's nest? Anybody know?

4015
06:34:55,880 --> 06:34:57,639
How do I get up there?

4016
06:34:57,639 --> 06:34:59,639
I want to get up on the crow's nest

4017
06:34:59,639 --> 06:35:04,000
Go back to the captain's cabin

4018
06:35:17,360 --> 06:35:21,389
I

4019
06:35:21,389 --> 06:35:25,080
Seriously

4020
06:35:25,080 --> 06:35:28,520
Just go down here. That's not where i'm trying to go, man

4021
06:35:46,090 --> 06:35:49,610
Fucking christ. Okay. What am I doing in here?

4022
06:35:50,330 --> 06:36:06,669
What is this thing? Do I still have fucked up lips? I don't know. Let's find out

4023
06:36:08,060 --> 06:36:10,880
probably

4024
06:36:10,880 --> 06:36:12,159
It looks okay

4025
06:36:12,159 --> 06:36:20,959
I've absorbed most of it. Not as bad. No, not as bad

4026
06:36:38,639 --> 06:36:43,369
Why do I have lopsided ears

4027
06:36:43,450 --> 06:36:48,490
I don't know because i'm a human and my genetic dna has made me look different than everybody else

4028
06:36:49,290 --> 06:36:53,450
And yeah, some of us have like a longer finger a bigger earlobe

4029
06:36:54,250 --> 06:36:59,930
A slightly elongated nose a big toe that is as big as three big toes put together some of it

4030
06:37:00,250 --> 06:37:02,569
That's i'm a human being i'm just a person here

4031
06:37:06,779 --> 06:37:23,930
Have I been streaming for almost seven hours?

4032
06:37:23,930 --> 06:37:28,520
Seven hours in antsy drew. Oh, I wouldn't have it any other way. I hate the skin

4033
06:37:28,759 --> 06:37:39,279
So I would not have it any other way. That's the doggy kennel in magnus's note

4034
06:37:40,240 --> 06:37:43,930
What are you talking about

4035
06:37:43,930 --> 06:37:44,810
What?

4036
06:37:44,810 --> 06:37:48,090
Why does there a doggy key? What's the doggy key for?

4037
06:37:53,159 --> 06:37:58,520
Why do I have a doggy key for a fake member of the dru crew?

4038
06:37:59,240 --> 06:38:04,750
I bet you half the dru crew does not like this game. That doesn't mean we have to make fun of it

4039
06:38:06,029 --> 06:38:13,080
Is that for the music box? The dog key is for the music box

4040
06:38:14,080 --> 06:38:15,360
You shouldn't be

4041
06:38:15,360 --> 06:38:30,880
Are you projecting?

4042
06:38:30,880 --> 06:38:36,200
I'm not projecting this is projecting

4043
06:38:36,840 --> 06:39:22,479
Use fidget spinner in the radio room

4044
06:39:26,459 --> 06:39:30,360
What do you use a fidget spinner in the radio room?

4045
06:39:40,400 --> 06:39:53,049
That makes sense

4046
06:39:53,049 --> 06:39:59,049
These must be the sounding charts from magnus's note. Oh shit to find those numbers and the locator compass he mentioned

4047
06:39:59,369 --> 06:40:01,369
Oh shit, let's go

4048
06:40:12,959 --> 06:40:18,959
These must be the sounding charts from magnus's notebook. I need to find those numbers and the locator compass he mentioned

4049
06:40:19,520 --> 06:40:21,520
the numbers first

4050
06:40:21,599 --> 06:40:23,599
I don't know how the fuck to get the numbers

4051
06:40:24,639 --> 06:40:26,639
How the hell am I supposed to know?

4052
06:40:29,400 --> 06:40:31,400
I have 14

4053
06:40:33,180 --> 06:40:34,680
86

4054
06:40:34,680 --> 06:40:47,880
14

4055
06:40:47,880 --> 06:40:50,840
I cheated this is like so dumb. I cheated

4056
06:40:52,439 --> 06:40:54,439
I never would have figured this out. I just I cheated

4057
06:40:59,069 --> 06:41:00,349
We're cheaters

4058
06:41:00,349 --> 06:41:06,189
What's the tide at?

4059
06:41:06,189 --> 06:41:14,250
Tides high tide has to be low

4060
06:41:14,250 --> 06:41:16,810
low tide

4061
06:41:16,889 --> 06:41:39,069
We're low tide

4062
06:41:39,069 --> 06:41:41,069
There are markings behind

4063
06:41:42,970 --> 06:41:45,450
You just you understand why the hell would i've ever done this?

4064
06:41:47,279 --> 06:41:53,740
26

4065
06:41:53,740 --> 06:41:56,939
Cheating in the game for six-year-olds. I would love to meet the six-year-old that knew how to do that

4066
06:41:57,740 --> 06:42:03,740
I would shake their hand and be like you are such a great six-year-old excellent work

4067
06:42:04,619 --> 06:42:06,619
Eating toasties into the mic

4068
06:42:09,080 --> 06:42:15,869
All right, 26

4069
06:42:15,950 --> 06:42:26,569
26

4070
06:42:26,569 --> 06:42:34,189
Go back up

4071
06:42:34,189 --> 06:42:39,709
14 and 26 done. You need to find two more numbers to add up to 86. Put the locator on there

4072
06:42:42,810 --> 06:42:45,520
Where's the locator?

4073
06:42:45,520 --> 06:42:47,439
Where's the locator?

4074
06:42:47,439 --> 06:42:49,099
Don't I have it?

4075
06:42:49,099 --> 06:42:51,099
Share toasties. No, they're mine

4076
06:42:51,259 --> 06:42:58,939
It's our oh it's

4077
06:42:58,939 --> 06:43:02,779
Find the location that reveals the correct set of sounding numbers and all four of the location holes

4078
06:43:03,419 --> 06:43:06,560
Okay

4079
06:43:06,560 --> 06:43:14,750

4116
06:47:35,520 --> 06:47:47,479
Worst hair of the year, that means anytime that i've been on camera and my hair has just looked like absolute dog shit

4117
06:47:51,180 --> 06:47:53,180
We're talking worst hair of the year

4118
06:47:54,479 --> 06:47:56,479
You know, it was in a category last year

4119
06:47:56,720 --> 06:47:58,720
Uh worse new character

4120
06:48:01,310 --> 06:48:06,110
Some of the new characters that have made appearances. I'm not sure how many they've been so far, but we'll do it

4121
06:48:08,349 --> 06:48:10,990
If you know not bugleberry because bugleberry was introduced

4122
06:48:11,790 --> 06:48:14,430
Last year so you cannot nominate bugleberry again

4123
06:48:15,150 --> 06:48:27,130
He's not a new character bugleberry bugleberry was in the stream last year, uh worst face

4124
06:48:28,319 --> 06:48:34,959
Video and screenshot we I would like I want a clip of the face. You're describing a screenshot of the worst image from that

4125
06:48:36,080 --> 06:48:38,159
Face worst face of the entire year

4126
06:48:41,799 --> 06:48:45,639
We also have worst peter

4127
06:48:45,639 --> 06:48:48,439
Had to make an appearance had to come back worst peter is on this list

4128
06:48:50,279 --> 06:48:53,400
Worst chat experience of the year is on this list

4129
06:48:55,360 --> 06:48:58,189
What that means?

4130
06:48:58,189 --> 06:49:00,360
Some people got confused by this

4131
06:49:00,439 --> 06:49:04,439
That that's not like my stream. Oh, I didn't like the stream. No, no, no

4132
06:49:04,520 --> 06:49:07,639
This is like the worst experience you had in the chat

4133
06:49:12,750 --> 06:49:15,389
Like you're in the chat room and you're just going holy shit

4134
06:49:16,110 --> 06:49:19,319
This is horrible worst chat experience of the year

4135
06:49:21,119 --> 06:49:22,959
Worst noise of the year

4136
06:49:22,959 --> 06:49:24,959
And of course best noise of the year

4137
06:49:27,389 --> 06:49:37,720
I feel like we're gonna get quite a few nominations making an appearance again from last year also, uh in this same kind of realm

4138
06:49:38,279 --> 06:49:40,779
Worst impression and best impression

4139
06:49:41,400 --> 06:49:43,000
What you thought the worst?

4140
06:49:43,000 --> 06:49:45,720
Impression I did the whole year was and of course the best one

4141
06:49:46,520 --> 06:49:48,520
Worst meltdown on stream

4142
06:49:51,680 --> 06:49:54,700
I don't know if there's been that many this year. I'm sure there has

4143
06:49:55,580 --> 06:49:59,680
A meltdown. I don't even need to explain that. Here's a new one for 2019

4144
06:50:01,099 --> 06:50:03,099
best one guy moment

4145
06:50:05,479 --> 06:50:09,799
A moment where one person potentially changed the course of an entire stream

4146
06:50:11,520 --> 06:50:15,919
Best moment best one guy moment if you got a lot of them, then i'm sure there'll be plenty of nominees

4147
06:50:23,549 --> 06:50:25,979
worst gamer moment

4148
06:50:25,979 --> 06:50:30,540
Something that was just unbelievable that I I did it. It was so bad that you can't even

4149
06:50:31,180 --> 06:50:33,180
describe to anybody

4150
06:50:33,639 --> 06:50:39,880
Just how shitty that was whether I fell off a cliff in it or I did something like worst. It's terrible gaming video gaming

4151
06:50:42,700 --> 06:50:47,740
Jump king. I beat jump king. What how dare you? I what do you mean jump king?

4152
06:50:49,930 --> 06:50:51,290
I beat

4153
06:50:51,369 --> 06:50:53,599
I beat jump king

4154
06:50:53,599 --> 06:50:56,720
All right, whatever you could be free to nominate whatever you want

4155
06:50:56,720 --> 06:51:00,479
But I it is gonna ask it goes through the academy after the nomination process

4156
06:51:02,220 --> 06:51:06,970
Uh, and also best gaming moment something that I did something you never thought I was ever gonna do

4157
06:51:07,689 --> 06:51:10,159
something that was

4158
06:51:10,159 --> 06:51:13,279
You kind of cock your head to the side and go how did he just do that?

4159
06:51:18,159 --> 06:51:23,759
So worst gamer moment and best gamer moment also making a new appearance. Oh, not a new prince but coming back

4160
06:51:24,720 --> 06:51:27,119
Worst joke taking more than five minutes to set up

4161
06:51:27,759 --> 06:51:34,880
And best joke taking more than five minutes to set up. I think I don't have to explain what those what that means

4162
06:51:38,319 --> 06:51:43,930
guys every single one of these is you can't just say today there's been like

4163
06:51:45,349 --> 06:51:49,290
250 streams or something this year is you it's just fresh in your memory

4164
06:51:50,509 --> 06:51:57,840
Also worst stream of the year and best stream of the year. Good luck with that one

4165
06:51:57,840 --> 06:52:00,400
What do you think? What's the worst stream of the whole year?

4166
06:52:02,119 --> 06:52:04,119
Of this one get out of here

4167
06:52:05,759 --> 06:52:09,979
Making a new appearance this year because it's very important. I'm

4168
06:52:10,619 --> 06:52:13,439
This one. I don't know how this is gonna play out

4169
06:52:14,619 --> 06:52:17,900
Because there's been a lot. I don't know what the nominees for

4170
06:52:18,779 --> 06:52:20,779
worst joke of the decade

4171
06:52:21,099 --> 06:52:23,099
Will be that also includes youtube

4172
06:52:26,360 --> 06:52:30,040
Because we are at 2020 and I have been doing this for almost 10 years

4173
06:52:36,189 --> 06:52:38,430
I've been on youtube and on twitch for

4174
06:52:39,150 --> 06:52:40,189
just

4175
06:52:40,189 --> 06:52:42,189
Barely under 10 full years

4176
06:52:42,840 --> 06:52:47,840
Worst joke of the whole decade

4177
06:52:47,840 --> 06:52:52,409
Best joke of the whole decade. What do you think is the best thing i've ever done like joke was

4178
06:52:58,860 --> 06:53:02,860
Best joke of the decade. Good luck with your nominations. And then one final thing

4179
06:53:06,029 --> 06:53:08,029
This is a this is just fun

4180
06:53:09,549 --> 06:53:10,990
I could do it on my own

4181
06:53:10,990 --> 06:53:13,389
I maybe I was going to think of maybe surprising people about this

4182
06:53:13,389 --> 06:53:17,709
But even I and a few other people that I would bring on to try to do this wouldn't know all these

4183
06:53:19,000 --> 06:53:21,000
We're going to do a compilation

4184
06:53:21,580 --> 06:53:23,740
For all the times i've lied on this stream

4185
06:53:24,639 --> 06:53:30,509
or on youtube

4186
06:53:30,509 --> 06:53:32,680
so if you if you have

4187
06:53:32,759 --> 06:53:35,080
uh

4188
06:53:35,080 --> 06:53:36,759
if you have

4189
06:53:36,759 --> 06:53:39,799
Something that you would like to nominate for a time that I have lied

4190
06:53:40,520 --> 06:53:42,360
And you can give proof

4191
06:53:42,360 --> 06:53:44,040
You can show it

4192
06:53:44,040 --> 06:53:48,680
I'm going to make a large compilation video of every single time i've lied

4193
06:53:51,599 --> 06:53:53,599
Ever or just this year ever?

4194
06:53:58,569 --> 06:54:00,569
All lies of the decade

4195
06:54:08,779 --> 06:54:10,779
That would give us 20

4196
06:54:11,479 --> 06:54:13,479
Well 19 categories

4197
06:54:16,119 --> 06:54:18,409
does anybody

4198
06:54:18,409 --> 06:54:19,450
have

4199
06:54:19,450 --> 06:54:21,200
a category

4200
06:54:21,200 --> 06:54:23,119
They would like it for a viewer's choice

4201
06:54:31,020 --> 06:54:32,619
19 categories

4202
06:54:32,619 --> 06:54:34,619
I'd like to make it a clean 20

4203
06:54:36,299 --> 06:54:42,380
Best category worst category. I removed the me me shitty ones like best ice cream worst category best category

4204
06:54:42,380 --> 06:54:44,619
They would just fill her dog shit. They're not in it this year

4205
06:54:49,799 --> 06:54:55,319
Best and worst face worst face is on there. I'm not sure you can have a best face and worst face

4206
06:54:55,400 --> 06:54:57,400
What would a best face be?

4207
06:54:57,400 --> 06:54:59,959
What would what would a best face be?

4208
06:55:01,159 --> 06:55:04,700
Loudest vroom. I mean that's not even

4209
06:55:05,099 --> 06:55:07,099
I know that's not even nominations

4210
06:55:08,189 --> 06:55:10,990
That's just what was the loudest car go? Okay. All right

4211
06:55:11,150 --> 06:55:15,790
We have to have we have to find it somebody's we got to find the loudest rooms of the year

4212
06:55:20,490 --> 06:55:22,889
Let me add this let me add this that's so stupid

4213
06:55:24,319 --> 06:55:26,319
loudest fucking rooms

4214
06:55:27,610 --> 06:55:31,950
Oh shit, hold on

4215
06:55:31,950 --> 06:55:33,950
Why is this I don't want to do that

4216
06:55:35,049 --> 06:55:38,560
Jump king is not gonna win

4217
06:55:38,560 --> 06:55:40,860
I would be shocked

4218
06:55:40,860 --> 06:55:44,779
Best ignore stream moment. How's anyone gonna find that? That's a good question

4219
06:55:45,580 --> 06:55:49,099
That's a really good question

4220
06:55:49,099 --> 06:55:50,860
Hey, any nancy droop

4221
06:55:50,860 --> 06:55:58,650
Now, where's my writing music?

4222
06:55:58,790 --> 06:56:00,430
writing

4223
06:56:00,430 --> 06:56:03,069
Music, where is it? I like that stuff. It was good. Here it is

4224
06:56:07,869 --> 06:56:13,869
Okay, so uh anything else besides uh, the loudest of rooms of the year

4225
06:56:19,740 --> 06:56:21,419
loudest of rumors

4226
06:56:25,259 --> 06:56:28,880
Anything else

4227
06:56:28,880 --> 06:56:31,599
Best beatbox moment. I don't know if that works

4228
06:56:32,639 --> 06:56:36,090
loudest rumors of the year

4229
06:56:38,750 --> 06:56:40,750
best chat image

4230
06:56:43,439 --> 06:56:47,020
best

4231
06:56:47,020 --> 06:56:51,340
Best comment germa has read that's kind of a one guy. That's that could be filled in the one guy moment

4232
06:56:55,680 --> 06:56:57,849
best clip

4233
06:56:57,849 --> 06:56:59,290
Best clip of the year

4234
06:56:59,290 --> 06:57:04,810
I feel like it's tough to do best clip of the year because the best clips of the year might actually be in a bunch

4235
06:57:04,810 --> 06:57:17,389
of these categories

4236
06:57:17,389 --> 06:57:20,509
Isn't that just one of the most yeah, that would be like the most viewed ones wouldn't it? Yeah

4237
06:57:24,490 --> 06:57:26,490
Worst excuse of the year

4238
06:57:27,130 --> 06:57:29,130
Best qrs

4239
06:57:29,689 --> 06:57:35,200
Well, it would just be the original one that happened that happened this year, right? I feel like that's gonna get nominated for something

4240
06:57:42,860 --> 06:57:49,049
best singing moment

4241
06:57:49,049 --> 06:57:52,169
That was this. Yeah, that was like in January February. I think

4242
06:57:52,889 --> 06:57:56,349
How about best singing?

4243
06:57:59,150 --> 06:58:05,790
I feel like they can only be five or six nominations for best singing only because i've probably only done singing like that

4244
06:58:06,349 --> 06:58:08,349
Four or five times this whole year

4245
06:58:16,040 --> 06:58:18,360
Do I do that a lot? I sing a lot

4246
06:58:21,900 --> 06:58:25,500
It could that be a worst singing and best singing of the year

4247
06:58:26,220 --> 06:58:31,720
I don't think that it could happen

4248
06:58:32,360 --> 06:58:34,360
It's gonna be hard to find

4249
06:58:39,560 --> 06:58:40,680
All right. I'm gonna put it on here

4250
06:58:40,680 --> 06:58:43,799
But remember keep in mind some of these categories might get removed

4251
06:58:44,880 --> 06:58:48,060
If they have two nominations, you know

4252
06:58:48,939 --> 06:58:58,029
I'm not gonna do a full thing for that. All right, let's do that. What best and worst singing of the year

4253
06:58:58,590 --> 06:59:07,400
Let's put it right here

4254
06:59:07,400 --> 06:59:09,400
worst singing

4255
06:59:10,599 --> 06:59:12,599
and best singing

4256
06:59:15,360 --> 06:59:18,000
I already know what's gonna be nominated here like thousand times

4257
06:59:21,560 --> 06:59:35,979
Also, I don't want to go too far and have 30 categories. Why not something about the community like best community created content

4258
06:59:36,540 --> 06:59:39,259
Oh, I don't I don't want I don't really want to do that

4259
06:59:40,159 --> 06:59:44,319
Because I don't want to make community content a contest that will show up at the end of the year

4260
06:59:48,200 --> 06:59:52,279
Kim and auto best kim or best auto moment

4261
06:59:53,720 --> 06:59:57,240
I can name you four or five times or he just kind of kim opened the

4262
06:59:59,599 --> 07:00:01,599
All right. That's a joke

4263
07:00:01,599 --> 07:00:03,599
that's a joke category because

4264
07:00:04,400 --> 07:00:06,639
It's going to be the same clip five times in a row

4265
07:00:07,360 --> 07:00:10,159
it's going to be kim opening the door behind me and

4266
07:00:10,639 --> 07:00:12,799
auto in her arms

4267
07:00:12,799 --> 07:00:17,180
Four or five times in a row. It's not even

4268
07:00:21,279 --> 07:00:29,150
Just auto moment. All right, best auto moment. I'll allow it. That's just that's stupid enough for me to think it's funny

4269
07:00:29,549 --> 07:00:31,549
All right, best auto moment

4270
07:00:42,590 --> 07:00:45,150
Okay, I think that's good

4271
07:00:45,950 --> 07:00:50,599
Worst hair new character face beater chat experience

4272
07:00:51,479 --> 07:00:59,360
Best auto moment best and worst singing best and worst noise best and worst impression worst meltdown

4273
07:00:59,919 --> 07:01:02,639
Best one guy moment best and worst gaming moment

4274
07:01:03,200 --> 07:01:08,959
Best and worst joke taking more than five minutes to set up best and worst stream of the year best and worst joke of the decade

4275
07:01:09,439 --> 07:01:19,799
Times i've lied and loudest rumors of the year. Peter is a year-old meme. I know it goes. I'm good

4276
07:01:20,680 --> 07:01:24,840
I want it there. I want it there because I know i've said it a few times this whole year

4277
07:01:25,159 --> 07:01:27,159
Who the fuck's even going to find it though?

4278
07:01:30,880 --> 07:01:32,880
It's time to retire Peter

4279
07:01:32,959 --> 07:01:34,479
No, it's not

4280
07:01:34,479 --> 07:01:38,319
No, it's not not in nest. I okay i'll retire it after this

4281
07:01:39,360 --> 07:01:42,400
But the people that aren't here right now that are going to watch that stream

4282
07:01:43,240 --> 07:01:45,959
I want them to see that category and roll their eyes

4283
07:01:46,680 --> 07:01:58,240
All the way to the back of their head. That's the only reason why it's on here worst

4284
07:01:59,200 --> 07:02:01,369
cat puke

4285
07:02:01,369 --> 07:02:04,490
If you think that that's a bad noise or a best noise go ahead and nominate it. We'll see

4286
07:02:13,150 --> 07:02:18,439
Best scared moment. It's gonna get bloated. It's gonna get bloated

4287
07:02:23,180 --> 07:02:26,139
It's it's gonna start with I gotta put the can on it

4288
07:02:30,680 --> 07:02:39,740
Biggest all right. How about just instead of just biggest scare or best scare best scared moment. Okay, that that works. That's good

4289
07:02:44,200 --> 07:02:49,639
All right, and that's it. That's i'm capping it here. I'm capping it here. Best scared best scare moment. There you go

4290
07:02:58,750 --> 07:03:00,270
So, let's see. We got

4291
07:03:00,270 --> 07:03:03,389
One two, three, four, five six, seven, eight nine ten

4292
07:03:04,270 --> 07:03:12,540
Twenty twenty one two twenty three that's twenty three categories. I don't like that. That's like a scary like fucking horror movie number

4293
07:03:12,939 --> 07:03:14,540
Uh, so we need one more

4294
07:03:14,540 --> 07:03:29,819
Or i'm deleting one best jubate moment

4295
07:03:30,700 --> 07:03:32,939
No, not best not quietest of room

4296
07:03:41,849 --> 07:03:43,849

All right. I'm gonna put it on here. I'll put on worst and best new character

4306
07:04:56,360 --> 07:05:02,990
I mean it might I don't know if we have enough but we'll see

4307
07:05:05,689 --> 07:05:09,450
That that's 24 categories and 26 different videos

4308
07:05:10,669 --> 07:05:12,860
That's it

4309
07:05:12,860 --> 07:05:15,979

The new year's eve nominations channel is only

4313
07:05:26,409 --> 07:05:30,169
It is not a discussion channel. I'm gonna put rules there and i'm gonna pin a message there

4314
07:05:30,169 --> 07:05:32,169
So you can see and you can read the rules there

4315
07:05:32,409 --> 07:05:34,409
basically we want

4316
07:05:34,790 --> 07:05:36,430
category

4317
07:05:36,430 --> 07:05:41,950

4318
07:05:46,639 --> 07:05:50,119
best feet

4319
07:05:50,119 --> 07:05:54,200
I I've showed my feet on camera once and it was because I was in a dunk tank

4320
07:05:56,169 --> 07:06:05,659
That one why did I read that I because like 50 people have been saying it

4321
07:06:10,000 --> 07:06:12,000
All right. That's it

4322
07:06:12,000 --> 07:06:14,569
There are your categories

4323
07:06:14,569 --> 07:06:16,569
so as of

4324
07:06:17,880 --> 07:06:20,200
As of some point early next week

4325
07:06:24,959 --> 07:06:26,959
I'd say

4326
07:06:26,959 --> 07:06:28,959
I want to give

4327
07:06:28,959 --> 07:06:30,959
I want to be able to have plenty of time

4328
07:06:30,959 --> 07:06:33,439
to put together the videos for the nominations

4329
07:06:34,479 --> 07:06:37,549
so

4330
07:06:37,549 --> 07:06:39,470
I'm gonna say

4331
07:06:39,470 --> 07:06:42,110
Let's see. How many days do you guys need like six seven?

4332
07:06:43,310 --> 07:06:47,549
One two, three, four five. I'd say by like early late by late next week

4333
07:06:52,479 --> 07:06:55,290
Because then that would mean

4334
07:06:55,290 --> 07:07:01,049
That would give one two, three four about five days to make the videos. Yeah, so as of thursday

4335
07:07:02,970 --> 07:07:05,470
As of thursday night at midnight

4336
07:07:07,759 --> 07:07:24,779
There is no you're we're not taking nominations anymore because I want to give at least one two three full days

4337
07:07:25,340 --> 07:07:27,340
Of being able to put these videos together

4338
07:07:27,979 --> 07:07:33,740
Thursday was two days ago. Well now it's six days from now

4339
07:07:38,090 --> 07:07:40,970
Oh, you know, I think no we can handle it. We can handle it. We can handle it

4341
07:07:54,409 --> 07:07:56,409
As of friday the 27th

4342
07:07:59,400 --> 07:08:02,040
At midnight, you can no longer send in any nominations

4343
07:08:03,639 --> 07:08:08,279
That'll give three full days. I'm gonna bring on at least four or five people to edit this stuff

4344
07:08:09,080 --> 07:08:14,119
So we can make sure we can get it up so just about so almost almost seven days from right now

4345
07:08:21,930 --> 07:08:24,569
And you know what? That's the end of the stream. Yeah, that's like it's that's it

4346
07:08:25,369 --> 07:08:29,849
I'm not going back to nancy drew right now. That's not happening. It's like seven and a half hours

4349
07:08:40,700 --> 07:08:43,610
After we do ai dungeon tomorrow, maybe i'll just finish this

4350
07:08:44,700 --> 07:08:46,700
Because that's the plan tomorrow. We're gonna do ai dungeon

4351
07:08:48,599 --> 07:08:50,599

4354
07:09:01,040 --> 07:09:04,720
All right, that's it

4355
07:09:04,720 --> 07:09:10,639

07:09:19,979 --> 07:09:22,479
It should be a lot of fun though

4359
07:09:22,639 --> 07:09:24,639
I might try to get a few other surprises done

4360
07:09:25,520 --> 07:09:29,200
For that stream. I can't it there's been a lot of stuff going on. So

4361
07:09:30,779 --> 07:09:32,779
Last year that was a ton of fun

4362
07:09:33,849 --> 07:09:37,849
It was I loved everything about the kind of worst of the year stuff. So

4363
07:09:41,709 --> 07:09:44,909
It will absolutely be fun

4364
07:09:44,909 --> 07:09:48,830
What day is that stream going to be that stream will be on new year's eve

4365
07:09:49,369 --> 07:09:52,060
december 31st

4366
07:09:52,080 --> 07:09:54,159
We will probably start because I want to drop the ball

4367
07:09:54,880 --> 07:09:57,360
Uh like I did last year on um

4368
07:09:58,569 --> 07:10:02,569
What did I do last year? Did I do eastern the ball drop eastern or did I do ball drop pacific?

4369
07:10:03,450 --> 07:10:09,599
I think I did eastern didn't I?

4370
07:10:09,599 --> 07:10:11,599
So it wouldn't be insanely late

4371
07:10:13,340 --> 07:10:15,340
So the stream will probably start

4372
07:10:15,979 --> 07:10:17,979
around 7 pm

4373
07:10:18,380 --> 07:10:22,459

Yes

4450
07:16:12,090 --> 07:16:14,330
I wonder how many people actually came in

4451
07:16:16,490 --> 07:16:18,490
I looked like

4452
07:16:19,029 --> 07:16:21,029

It's a cult and I'll have nothing to do with it

4487
07:19:05,900 --> 07:19:10,029
It's not a cult

4488
07:19:10,029 --> 07:19:15,709
it's a group of people that come together that are not part of any type of religion or any we just get together and we

4489
07:19:16,669 --> 07:19:18,669
Play the same game together

4490
07:19:18,830 --> 07:19:24,540
What is the definition of a cult?

4491
07:19:24,540 --> 07:19:28,700

Hey squim pst. Thanks for the thousand bits. Hey germ wanted to say thanks for making the drew crew thing in your streams

4507
07:20:47,790 --> 07:20:52,430
Uh me and my sisters have a tradition of playing the nancy drew game drew games every year at the holidays

For as long as I can remember so thanks for bringing back my childhood. Welcome to the crew

4509
07:20:57,229 --> 07:21:01,819
I flew off the handle during the that like red light green light

4510
07:21:02,700 --> 07:21:08,299
Light up the white light segment. I didn't I say that there was like the 27 of these games were worthless or something

4511
07:21:08,299 --> 07:21:10,299
I was really mean

4512
07:21:10,299 --> 07:21:15,439
I'm supposed to be the leader of the of the drew crew and I said like every one of their games is terrible or something

4513
07:21:16,000 --> 07:21:18,860
This is why nobody talks to me

4514
07:21:18,860 --> 07:21:23,979
Because I can't like oh dude. I wonder if like germa talks to any game companies. No, no, they don't they don't nobody

4515
07:21:24,060 --> 07:21:28,400
They don't they won't talk to me

4516
07:21:28,400 --> 07:21:36,279
I that'll never happen. Dude. Does germa have like any sponsorship opportunities with a couple of companies though?

4517
07:21:36,279 --> 07:21:41,880
They probably watched the xbox 360 red dead rant and they probably are like, holy fuck don't close that window

Uh insane cannibal caught on stream

4570
07:25:17,549 --> 07:25:29,229
It's actually kind of scary look at this scary image

4571
07:25:30,029 --> 07:25:37,930
Not that one

4572
07:25:37,930 --> 07:25:40,490
Not that one. It's a different one. I mean, that's also pretty scary

4573
07:25:41,369 --> 07:25:56,090
There you see him

4574
07:25:56,090 --> 07:25:57,369
You see

4575
07:25:57,369 --> 07:25:58,720
Where is it?

4576
07:26:04,159 --> 07:26:08,119
I see him

4577
07:26:08,119 --> 07:26:10,119
Enhance it. I will I just i'm gonna cover up this up

4578
07:26:15,389 --> 07:26:19,069
Wow before we do that

4579
07:26:19,069 --> 07:26:23,630
That was this future gamer's image. We also have 250 from butt squire who has a couple of images

4580
07:26:24,270 --> 07:26:26,270
There's me as the joker

4581
07:26:27,069 --> 07:26:34,360
I do I feel like you did. Did you enhance this?

4582
07:26:34,919 --> 07:26:38,599
Here find me find me. Okay. So where is he? I think I see him

4583
07:26:39,319 --> 07:26:54,639
Here's another one to look at

4584
07:26:54,639 --> 07:26:58,279
Yep

4585
07:26:58,279 --> 07:27:02,330
Yep

4586
07:27:02,330 --> 07:27:06,330
Okay, that was from butt squire. Thank you butt squire. Uh, very nice

4587
07:27:06,330 --> 07:27:10,009
Thanks for the thousand bits. I dreamed that I was sitting on a public toilet

4588
07:27:10,409 --> 07:27:15,049
And I heard you talking in the adjacent stall about how global warming is killing elephants

4589
07:27:15,610 --> 07:27:18,729
I was surprised to say the least also any thoughts on doing twitch sings

4590
07:27:20,650 --> 07:27:22,729
I will do twitch sings after new years

4591
07:27:23,450 --> 07:27:27,689
because I just put a category for best and worst singing on stream

4592
07:27:28,650 --> 07:27:33,610
And I feel like if I do that stream before the new years that'll take up every single slot

4593
07:27:35,240 --> 07:27:41,560
Maybe but thank you for the thousand bits ten bucks from very nice. Thank you

4594
07:27:42,200 --> 07:27:46,029
Appreciate that

4595
07:27:46,029 --> 07:27:50,189
Uh snooze and copter. Thanks for the 250. I was curious if you can imagine the taste this would have

4596
07:27:50,909 --> 07:27:52,909
Because for the weirdest reason I do

4597
07:27:53,790 --> 07:27:58,430
Everyone that had one of those old tvs probably can try it. Can I taste this?

4598
07:27:59,790 --> 07:28:05,229
Let's see. Can I taste this?

4599
07:28:14,090 --> 07:28:19,040
all right, uh

4600
07:28:19,040 --> 07:28:22,319
Taste this. Mm. So I can smell this

4601
07:28:23,119 --> 07:28:27,599
It smells like electricity. Do you guys know that kind of heavy

4602
07:28:28,700 --> 07:28:33,200
Electricity almost metallic smell that electricity smell

4603
07:28:36,619 --> 07:28:38,619
I know that there's people that can't

4604
07:28:40,060 --> 07:28:42,060
I think some people can't sense that right

4605
07:28:42,700 --> 07:28:47,900
You're like ozone. It's like that ozone smell that ozone in your nostrils and in the back of your throat

4606
07:28:51,020 --> 07:28:53,069
Yeah, I can taste this image

4607
07:28:53,069 --> 07:28:55,709
Yep

4608
07:28:55,709 --> 07:28:58,189
Any chance you're also going to revisit the sims with new mods

4609
07:28:59,470 --> 07:29:02,830
Maybe one of the older sims games too because they have other wacky mods

4610
07:29:05,439 --> 07:29:07,040
um

4611
07:29:07,040 --> 07:29:11,279
I feel like I did the sequel and I did the sims 4 and then I did the sims the sims 4 sequel

4612
07:29:11,680 --> 07:29:16,000
I feel like if I want to do that again, I would probably go back to one of the older ones and do something ridiculous

4613
07:29:16,799 --> 07:29:22,779
Because I've never really played the sims 2 or the sims 3 on stream

4614
07:29:23,500 --> 07:29:27,000
But yeah, I thought about it. That's what I was asking

4615
07:29:28,279 --> 07:29:30,119
Oh, yeah. Yes

4616
07:29:30,119 --> 07:29:31,689
Yes

4617
07:29:31,689 --> 07:29:37,689
Hey 25 dr. Pepper over 25 flavors in dr. Pepper. Thanks to the 250 worst impression goes to ed stark

4618
07:29:37,689 --> 07:29:40,090
You're not going to do it. I don't think that was this year

4619
07:29:40,889 --> 07:29:42,889
I think that may have been two years ago

4620
07:29:43,290 --> 07:29:53,290
Two more bits to do and then we're going to take off and see tomorrow for ai dungeon and maybe some more nancy drew crew

4621
07:29:58,139 --> 07:30:02,799
Esparta escalada thanks for the 250. Hey germa. I had an awful christmas celebration with my family today

4622
07:30:03,439 --> 07:30:06,240
And his dreams always cheer me up when I feel bad. Just want to say thanks

4623
07:30:06,959 --> 07:30:12,909
I'm really sorry to hear that

4624
07:30:12,909 --> 07:30:15,069
Nobody deserves to have a shitty christmas

4625
07:30:16,319 --> 07:30:20,430
I'm sorry to hear that

4626
07:30:20,430 --> 07:30:23,869
Regardless of however you celebrate it. I know people some people do a few days early

4627
07:30:23,869 --> 07:30:26,750
Some people do a few days after family travels. I understand. I get it

4628
07:30:28,919 --> 07:30:30,680
I'm sorry to hear that but

4629
07:30:30,680 --> 07:30:34,639
If this stream can cheer you up

4630
07:30:34,639 --> 07:30:40,990
I'm happy it can

4631
07:30:40,990 --> 07:30:42,909
very happy

4632
07:30:42,909 --> 07:30:51,000
Can we get one more germa wink before you leave? No, i've i've removed my shirt. It's off. I had to take it off

4633
07:30:51,000 --> 07:30:53,000
It's like I got lipstick all over it

4634
07:30:56,330 --> 07:30:58,330
But thank you esparta escalada

4635
07:30:58,810 --> 07:31:06,090
Anything else show official thanks for the 500 of bits not encouraging your nancy drew here's some stuff that is not encouraging your nancy drew stream

4636
07:31:07,049 --> 07:31:09,689
Also, just posted some images and projects in the discord for you

4637
07:31:13,639 --> 07:31:15,639
What on earth is going on here?

4638
07:31:16,200 --> 07:31:18,200
All right. This is uh

4639
07:31:19,720 --> 07:31:22,090
I like this one

4640
07:31:22,090 --> 07:31:24,090
This one is also a scary image

4641
07:31:28,540 --> 07:31:30,540
We got fucking scary images

4642
07:31:32,889 --> 07:31:35,770
This one is this is the scary one. We'll just do that one now

4643
07:31:36,490 --> 07:31:42,569
It's very large this is in blunder so you probably can guess what this is going to be

4644
07:31:51,159 --> 07:32:00,169
Jesus christ, what's wrong with my eyes?

4645
07:32:04,229 --> 07:32:16,490
Confirmed bald the more I look at it the more I feel like it's staring into me. I have to get it off the screen

4646
07:32:18,250 --> 07:32:30,400
Here's the other one

4647
07:32:36,810 --> 07:32:39,439
God damn it. Oh

4648
07:32:44,540 --> 07:32:46,540
And we also had from tingy

4649
07:32:48,700 --> 07:32:50,139
Thank you tingy

4650
07:32:50,139 --> 07:32:53,919
for the 250

4651
07:32:54,000 --> 07:33:01,310
And they say listen tingy say i'm still hoping you can get that rollercoaster tycoon 2 mod working where we're the guests in the park

4652
07:33:02,669 --> 07:33:06,349
I don't think you can

4653
07:33:06,349 --> 07:33:08,590
because

4654
07:33:08,590 --> 07:33:10,590
From what I understand

4655
07:33:10,590 --> 07:33:14,430
It's just not it just doesn't work anymore. Just not on anymore

4656
07:33:15,150 --> 07:33:18,830
The server is turned off and I would have to make my own server to host it or something

4657
07:33:19,630 --> 07:33:29,959
I think that was what we came to the conclusion of I can host it. I can host it. I can host it

4658
07:33:31,549 --> 07:33:35,709
There was a lot more to it and it took it was going to take probably another few days to figure that out

4659
07:33:37,310 --> 07:33:41,290
But i'm looking forward to tomorrow. We're going to do ai dungeon

4660
07:33:43,419 --> 07:33:45,819
This was this stream was very strange

4661
07:33:47,049 --> 07:33:49,290
Uh, I feel like this was like six streams

4662
07:33:50,009 --> 07:33:53,470
Because i'm thinking about the activities that were done and the things that happened on this stream

4663
07:33:53,950 --> 07:33:56,349
And I feel like that was over the course of the last like four days

4664
07:33:57,310 --> 07:34:00,060
That was a lot of different streams together

4665
07:34:00,619 --> 07:34:02,860
I was like changing channels in my brain

4666
07:34:05,950 --> 07:34:10,299
All right

4667
07:34:10,299 --> 07:34:13,580
Good night guys. I'll see you tomorrow ai dungeon may be finishing up nancy drew

4668
07:34:14,299 --> 07:34:16,490
for the drew crew

4669
07:34:16,490 --> 07:34:37,470
Good night. See you tomorrow
