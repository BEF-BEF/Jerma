00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:07,000
Good afternoon. Hi, welcome back. Sorry, yesterday, but welcome.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:17,769
Okay, good to see you again. Oh, MonkaS clown detected.

3
00:00:17,769 --> 00:00:24,890
Today, we are going to play WarioWare for the Nintendo GameCube.

4
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:29,609
And you're probably wondering, Jeremy, you said that we're probably gonna be playing Casino Inc. today.

5
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:34,409
And I wouldn't even be saying that. That was last night Jeremy saying that.

6
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:35,210
It's a different person.

7
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:41,590
So, the reason is because I think that game's gonna take more than a few streams,

8
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,549
or maybe like more than one to two full streams to do.

9
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:49,530
And I'm not gonna be around tomorrow, or the next day, or the next day.

10
00:00:50,469 --> 00:00:55,990
Over the next four plus days, I've got a lot of stuff going on in my personal life.

11
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:04,569
Those of you that don't know, I am moving, staying in Vegas, but moving over the next week or two.

12
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:11,420
And gotta get a lot of shit done. Gotta get a lot of stuff in order,

13
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:15,670
especially considering the circumstances as of right now.

14
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,780
All the stuff with the coronavirus. I gotta get my shit together.

15
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:30,780
So, he's moving to Vegas. That's right, I am.

16
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,930
But, so I didn't want to start Casino Inc. because I want to give it at least the necessary time,

17
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,489
because it looks like a really, really fun, interesting game.

18
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:45,430
So, I was like, what can we do today for a little while over the next X amount of hours?

19
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:49,750
And well, WarioWare is one of them. And obviously, Animal Crossing as well.

20
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:53,269
So, the plan is we're gonna play WarioWare until we have eaten our full.

21
00:01:53,269 --> 00:01:58,540
And then we're gonna move on to Animal Crossing because I want to play it again.

22
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:03,260
We're on first party Nintendo mode today and yesterday.

23
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:12,419
Las Vegas, here we come. That's the plan.

24
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:22,439
He's gonna be demonetized. Where are you moving to?

25
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:33,099
Las Vegas. Staying in Las Vegas. Just a different place.

26
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:47,990
Yeah, but where? Oh, well, you guys have. You guys have.

27
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:51,530
Fuck. Anyways, let's play.

28
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:55,449
Let's play WarioWare. How many WarioWares are there?

29
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,340
How many games? This is the GameCube WarioWare, right?

30
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:04,009
Because they like renamed it. This is WarioWare Mega Party Games.

31
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,550
But the original game was called Mega Micro Games.

32
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:13,860
It was renamed or something for some reason. I don't know. It's weird.

33
00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:20,900
But here you go. We have to do a test here because I don't know.

34
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:27,139
It looks like there is a full four or five second delay when this is coming through my capture device.

35
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,740
So we're going to do a test. I would like for you to all to participate in this test.

36
00:03:31,699 --> 00:03:34,900
Are you ready? Because it might. I got to get this right before I play.

37
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:43,159
One. How off is that? I need to know. It's probably very off.

38
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:52,199
One, two, one, two. It's off by like, yeah, it's going to be off by like two full seconds.

39
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:57,240
When I move, let's say I hit left and I say, oh, I look over on my other screen.

40
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,159
It takes three or four full seconds to happen.

41
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:04,120
All right, here we go. Let's try this. Ready? Tell me how this sounds.

42
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:15,500
Do I actually have to delay my voice by two thousand milliseconds for this to work?

43
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:24,600
Holy shit. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Better?

44
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:34,300
Now that's too much. It's close. So I'm early.

45
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:43,689
So you hear my voice first, right? All right, here we go.

46
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:52,649
Time to go to twenty. I feel like I'm in the fucking like past.

47
00:04:53,050 --> 00:05:00,149
I'm like I'm in like the future. One, two, one, two, one.

48
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:14,100
Hey, the video is early. How's this sound? Hey, what do you know about that?

49
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:22,949
What do you know? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

50
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:26,860
I don't know. Nothing changed. It's worse.

51
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:31,579
Fuck. This whole thing is fucked up. I need to like hear this, but I can't.

52
00:05:32,870 --> 00:06:01,720
All right, hold on. I was trying to get in my room. He was like, let me in.

53
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:10,329
OK, why is this such a huge delay? OK, here we go. Ready?

54
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:16,550
One. Two hours of fixing delay.

55
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:24,740
Why would it take like five full fucking seconds? It's close.

56
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:33,399
One, two, one, two. All right, what are you hearing?

57
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:38,920
Video first or audio first or me first? Voice is slightly early. OK, hold on.

58
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,829
I'll get it. This is this is this is it. This is the one you're at.

59
00:06:50,519 --> 00:07:00,170
Hey, are you ready to go? Are you ready?

60
00:07:01,579 --> 00:07:09,060
One, two, three, one. Now the game's further behind.

61
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,079
Now this is making me. No, that's way too much.

62
00:07:16,149 --> 00:07:25,980
I just added so much more time. Hey, how are you?

63
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:42,250
Two, three, four, five, one, two, three, four, four, five, five. Good. Yes.

64
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:56,100
Who are you? I'm me. Oh, God. It's not good. Should I do it a little more?

65
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,939
You tell me. Ready? I'll do the whole alphabet.

66
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:08,329
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P.

67
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:19,560
It's good. OK, I stopped right at the far at the point everybody wanted me to do.

68
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:41,340
All right, P, Q, R, S. That's fine. All right, here we go.

69
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:44,950
Stage clear games. Beat all other games.

70
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:55,019
Why is it a Game Boy Advance up there? You owe us a QRS.

71
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:09,379
No, I'm not going to do it. Grab. How do I grab?

72
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,639
Well, I don't know. What do you mean? I just got that wrong.

73
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:22,840
Oh, OK. All right. All right. Where's the fucking storyline?

74
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:27,659
Isn't there like a storyline? Oh, this is the first one.

75
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:33,909
God. All right. You got it. The screen is cut off.

76
00:09:34,549 --> 00:09:39,659
Wait, why is the screen cut off? This is fucked up.

77
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:45,529
That's happening to me, too. That's not just happening to you guys.

78
00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:52,899
That's happening to me. Hold on. Yeah, that's happening to me, too.

79
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,309
Should have done the QRS. Oh, fuck. I got it.

80
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,279
Got it. How many of these do I have to do? Is there a boss?

81
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,509
Oh, fuck. I could put clothes on. I'm good.

82
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:43,909
That's what I look like right now. Oh, bar. Oh, shit.

83
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:46,389
OK, it swings all the way. How do I? OK, I got it.

84
00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:51,190
Is he playing party game? No, they renamed this game.

85
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:59,350
This is the original one for the GameCube. All right, I got the one up. Let's go.

86
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:03,320
This is a face game game. Do I really have to go put on clothes?

87
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:25,210
What? Fuck, I'm going to lose. Should have clothes on.

88
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:28,250
No, I don't have to put on clothes. I don't have to wear clothes if I don't want to.

89
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:32,549
Easy. Done. I'm in my own room. I'm in my own house.

90
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:44,039
I'm not in your house. I'm in my house. Oh, fuck, I lost.

91
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:48,870
Do I actually have to? All right. How about this?

92
00:11:48,870 --> 00:12:01,720
This is not my beautiful house. Holy fuck, there's a lot.

93
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:11,879
Wait, wait. Intro. Wait, it's supposed to be zoomed in.

94
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:15,639
Oh, all right. I get it. So, yeah, the game's not cut off.

95
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:24,620
It's supposed to look like this. I had everything was correct.

96
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:38,710
Now I have to redo that. I need to go get on naked.

97
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:42,070
All right, I promise I'll put a face cam on in like 40 minutes.

98
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:53,299
I can't. This is just an intro. There's a story. All right, speed up.

99
00:12:56,779 --> 00:13:08,039
Fuck. Okay. Excellent. Hello, his voice.

100
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:14,389
He's going to turn into a clickbait face cam streamer.

101
00:13:26,149 --> 00:13:29,509
Jeremy, you should get a mustache. You want me to get a fucking mustache?

102
00:13:31,779 --> 00:13:35,460
No. You think you get like serial killer vibes from me now?

103
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,139
If I grow a mustache, I increase that by like 50%.

104
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:51,110
You don't have to look at fucking reddit threads and I get to see like,

105
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,710
all right, is this guy like a serial killer?

106
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:58,700
Now imagine me with a huge ass mustache instead of is this guy a serial killer?

107
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,019
It turns into this guy's a serial killer.

108
00:14:04,809 --> 00:14:07,929
Balance. Oh, shit. Okay, I got it. Got the pieces.

109
00:14:07,929 --> 00:14:16,700
Curl. What? Oh, shit. Damn it. I didn't understand what it meant.

110
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:28,980
Spike the ball. Jump. Oh, I love this character. Look at that guy.

111
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:49,419
Swim. What? Did I get it? Shoot. Yes. Got it.

112
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:55,029
The audio is bad. I'll try. I'll fix it in a minute.

113
00:14:55,029 --> 00:15:01,940
This is for some reason this game in particular is like so fucked up when it got captured.

114
00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:04,100
And I was trying to figure it out, but I couldn't figure it out.

115
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:12,950
Jump. Oh, fuck. I got a jumping. Did I get it?

116
00:15:16,809 --> 00:15:19,049
Oh, fuck. I have to press up. Shit. All right.

117
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,490
Shoot. Shoot what? Oh, my God. I got it.

118
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:38,730
No. Fuck. I thought I was moving me. I thought I was moving the guy, not the trampoline.

119
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,570
Shit. All right. I'll put on clothes. I'll be back.

120
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,720
You know what's funny? Me turning on my face cam just made syncing this whole thing up

121
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:56,279
exponentially more difficult because now I have to sync the webcam too.

122
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,690
There's like three different things that need to be delayed. This is going to be,

123
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:08,759
well, this is going to be, well, we're here for a while. All right. If I turn the webcam on,

124
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:11,880
you're not going to see like a naked body, right? Because sometimes this fucking camera

125
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:17,160
takes the frame, the last frame that it saw, and it might be my naked body.

126
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:23,819
So I need to make sure that's not going to happen. Okay. I think we're good.

127
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:36,150
Let me make sure this is right. Nope. See what I mean? You see what I'm saying?

128
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:39,910
Did you see that? Like that, that could have been a naked person.

129
00:18:40,549 --> 00:18:52,819
Are you guys ready for a like, look, I get it. Look, it's so weird. This is so delayed.

130
00:18:52,819 --> 00:18:58,490
This is such a joke. I can't even monitor what I'm doing. I'm pointing and talking at you,

131
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:01,769
but the guy over here is doing the same thing like three seconds later.

132
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:09,750
It's fucking freaking me out. Okay. You ready? Here we go. Let's test it.

133
00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:16,970
I need my audio. Holy shit. Look at, look at how many different

134
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:19,130
fucking mini game levels there are. This is going to be sick.

135
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:26,299
All right. Where's my fucking audio device? Half screen face cam. Well, it has to be that

136
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:32,359
so we can get this synced up. I got another thing to sync. Welcome to the sync stream.

137
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:44,680
Okay. Here we go. How bad was that? Why is his jacket zipped up all the way?

138
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:48,519
Well, I don't know. I wonder why is this jacket zipped up all the way?

139
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:51,559
It doesn't have anything to do with the fact that there's nothing else underneath this.

140
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,599
And I put it on out of desperation because there's nothing fucking, there's nothing under here.

141
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:10,519
It's just nudity under this zip up. I'm not going to stand up. I'm not standing up.

142
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:17,349
All right. We have a very specific task to do. Are you ready? I have to go back.

143
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:23,190
So when the door opens, I'm going to move myself over here.

144
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:37,210
Let's get this open. This is going to be so fucked up. Oh, fuck. I messed it up. Hold on.

145
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:45,609
Wait, this is going to help. Holy shit. This is going to help. I can see it over here. I

146
00:20:45,609 --> 00:20:52,519
can see it like five seconds. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Ready? Okay. It's going to be longer.

147
00:20:52,519 --> 00:21:22,309
Longer. Ready? Check. This section is going to help. I can get this right. Hold on. Wait.

148
00:21:22,309 --> 00:22:13,750
No, I didn't press the button. Fuck. Close. Oh, it's close. Okay. Wait, wait, wait. Here we go.

149
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:36,099
Ready? Do you have the time, sir? Get the fuck out of here. Let's go. Let's go. We're good.

150
00:22:36,099 --> 00:23:04,180
Wait, I have to fix the, nevermind. I just realized I just was fucking like pointing.

151
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:10,869
Holy shit. There's a lot of people here that just watched me do that. There's a lot of people that

152
00:23:10,869 --> 00:23:17,529
just watched that happen. Like I would do that on my own. I tried, but it was, why is your forehead

153
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:37,990
shining? I don't know. Cause I have an oily T-zone. Here, here's your gold star. It's your T-zone.

154
00:23:38,950 --> 00:24:02,299
God. Here's that. Just take a shower. It doesn't, that's a plastic surgeon terminology. No,

155
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:08,740
it's a skincare terminology. Well, that's like, that's, that's what that is called.

156
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:15,690
Okay. And that's how you can tell. And those of you, you saw it in real time. You saw it in real time.

157
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:20,859
You watched it in real time. You watched me look at another monitor. So there was five community subs

158
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:25,259
came in and I looked over at the other monitor and there we go. I fell down and I got fucking hurt.

159
00:24:25,259 --> 00:24:29,700
Saw it in real time. So those of you that just like, that asked the question all the time,

160
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,660
what the fuck did he miss that? It's because somebody, I just looked over here because

161
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:36,259
something happened over here. I looked over here. I was looking over there. I was looking over here.

162
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:43,339
See something. I should do face cave every day. Uh, germa sucks. Thanks to the five community subs.

163
00:24:43,339 --> 00:25:11,690
All right, I'll get it here. God gave you two eyes for a reason.

164
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:16,680
What are you, are you implying that I need to frog eyes both monitors?

165
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:39,160
All right, here we go. Let's go. Jimmy T. Holy fuck. How do you defend? Got it. Catch. I don't

166
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:50,019
know. Okay. You can just like this. Got it. Hurdle. Just jump. Whoa. That was a lot quicker

167
00:25:50,019 --> 00:26:10,119
than I thought it was going to be. Balance. Swim. Did I get it? Yeah. Jump. I love these fucking

168
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:25,049
micro games. Here comes QRS. I'll get this one this time. Bounce. Right. I'm not moving him.

169
00:26:25,049 --> 00:26:27,930
I'm moving the trampoline. Got it. That's what the, that's where the hiccup was last time.

170
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:56,710
Good. Yeah. What are you talking about? I pressed A. Dead. Oh, fuck. Got it. Nice. All right. I only

171
00:26:56,710 --> 00:27:17,529
have two lives. I don't want to fuck this up. Speed up. But got it. Ooh, got it. Got it. Got it.

172
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:59,220
Got it. Loser. Whoa, that's close. I almost didn't get it. All right. Finish. Got it. Welcome to the

173
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:03,779
commentary of this game. I have to pay attention so much that all I can say is what happened at

174
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:34,250
the end. Knockout. Get him. I did. I beat it. Chill, baby. Chill. Got it. Do we keep, do we keep

175
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:51,529
going? Sci-fi. Dribble and splits. Wait, I just have to keep going. Land the jump. Holy shit.

176
00:28:53,259 --> 00:28:59,480
Frost. Oh, fuck. All right. I got it. I got it. I got it. Got it. I got it. I said it a lot of times

177
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:16,980
there. Assemble. Holy fuck. Okay. This game is more serious and more speedy. What do you mean blast

178
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:29,910
off? I just did. I held, I held the A button down. I think I actually dodged it somehow.

179
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:47,430
Side step. Got it. Dodge. Who's that? I thought it was shooting me. Wait, who's shooting who?

180
00:29:48,230 --> 00:30:00,819
Who's shooting who? Didn't got it. Oh, I see. We go from, we start it. Okay. Sci-fi. Here we go.

181
00:30:00,819 --> 00:30:09,349
Started sci-fi. This, this one's much quicker than the last one. Well, the future one, right?

182
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:19,930
Twitch plays WarioWare. Dude, rare minigames. I know. This is the one, this is not, I know it's

183
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:22,250
not the original one, but this is the one, this is the one that came out of the GameCube.

184
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:34,869
And I've heard great things. Pretty rare. I am not looking forward to when it gets to like

185
00:30:34,869 --> 00:30:40,069
times 10 speed. That's going to be kind of all over the place. Beam. Oh, you have to do it. It's

186
00:30:40,069 --> 00:30:55,269
actually like Street Fighter. That's fun. This one sucks. No story. This is just pure gameplay.

187
00:30:55,990 --> 00:31:09,910
This one is just pure hyper gameplay. Repeat, repel, repel. I don't know what,

188
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:31,109
do I have to push him, punch him? Chop. Fuck. Where the hell is my 40 minute unskippable?

189
00:31:31,829 --> 00:31:39,829
I'm not going to read that one out loud. This dude fucking sucks at this game.

190
00:31:39,829 --> 00:32:05,099
Strike. Strike who? Get five. Got five. Hit Mars. Red one. Shoot? Okay. Cool. Cross. Oh,

191
00:32:05,099 --> 00:32:19,130
that was close. It's four. Are you even actually doing anything? I did it. Yeah,

192
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:37,829
pressing, just sitting here watching. 22. Shit. Okay, we're good. Dodge. Escape.

193
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:58,250
Oh, got it. Got it. Complete what? Oh, yup. Yup. Yup. Yup. Yup. Yup. Yup. I'm super good at games

194
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:06,490
like this. That's why I got the spreader. You always want to get the spreader in these games.

195
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:31,640
Do I go in that? I don't understand what I do. Go in this? Oh, now that's a real penis music.

196
00:33:51,859 --> 00:34:14,010
Got it. Off duty time. We have to keep going. Oh, no. Here comes Mona. Got you. Got you.

197
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:34,010
Got it. Got it. I don't understand. Twirl the spaghetti. Twirl the spaghetti. Oh,

198
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:47,610
that was, that was, that was stupid. Sorry. I'm going to start right there at strange.

199
00:34:48,170 --> 00:35:07,820
Strange. No story. Can't play hands. He's so bad at video games. Steer. Oh, my God. I didn't even

200
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:27,829
know what the fuck. Mark page 10. Shine. Post. Got it. Squirt. I thought I was supposed to do it

201
00:35:27,829 --> 00:35:40,780
in the mouth. I thought, I thought it was like food. Look out. All right. No, no more mistakes.

202
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:59,019
There's the, there it is. There's the, that's the Wario wear that I know.

203
00:36:03,269 --> 00:36:16,389
God, I love micro gaming. Come on. What, was he not supposed to cut all his hair off?

204
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:42,280
Catch the toast. Deploy. I say, oh, I got it. Sniff. Okay. It's a bad parking job, but I,

205
00:36:42,280 --> 00:37:20,659
but I still got it. Oh, that was close. Oh, you little fuck. He didn't like come up high

206
00:37:20,659 --> 00:37:37,099
enough for me to grab him. All right. I'll get it. I'll, I'll get it. This is literally pre-recorded.

207
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:52,219
I mean, it technically is because I've pre-recorded the sound. Almost missed it.

208
00:37:53,210 --> 00:38:09,539
You guys can see, right? When I'm like with my big ugly mug in the way. Speed up. That's what,

209
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:13,619
that was really easy. You just have to press A. Well, you just have to press A on all of these.

210
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:53,349
Got it. Got it. Ooh, did I do it? No, I got it. No, I got it. Got it. Got it. All right. I gotta

211
00:38:53,349 --> 00:39:14,389
get this one now. Brush those fucking teeth. I got it. Okay. Got it. Fucking YouTube thumbnail

212
00:39:14,389 --> 00:39:38,570
face. I didn't mean to. You're so good at this. Thanks. I appreciate that. You think so? I can't

213
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:43,159
say that now. I can't say that I did something. Like I can't say the word got it now because I've

214
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:57,980
said it too many times and I've recorded it too many times. You're good at parking. Oh my God.

215
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:03,420
I got it again. I was like dropping fucking flavor drops in that person's mouth. I don't know what

216
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:17,369
the fuck I'm doing. Pound? Watch out for the hand. Hit the nail. Hit the nail. Hit the nail,

217
00:40:17,369 --> 00:40:32,440
Jeremy. Hit the nail. All right. Good. One up. Next game. Nine volt coming up.

218
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:46,230
Everyone can do that. It's just level one Mario. Throw? Oh, he's all the way in the back.

219
00:40:46,230 --> 00:41:02,630
I didn't know. Vacuum. Shoot. That's a pretty cool gun. Oh, he didn't know. Dodge.

220
00:41:07,019 --> 00:41:28,659
I should play that and beat it on screen. Punch. Nine volt. Connect. I don't know how to play

221
00:41:28,659 --> 00:41:34,409
Dr. Mario. I've never played it. I don't know how the game even works. I have fucking no idea.

222
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:38,650
You know what I know about Dr. Mario? It's his side B as he throws a pill in Smash Brothers. I've

223
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:48,460
never played the game. I don't even know what happens. It's Candy Crush, but it's different.

224
00:41:49,739 --> 00:41:57,510
That's his new way. That's not even right. That's incorrect. That's how much I know

225
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:17,780
about Mario Dr. Mario MD. Here we go. I love balloon fight. I don't know if you just want to

226
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:36,380
play Mario Brothers 1. Oops, sorry. It just told me to shoot. It didn't say to shoot. Enter.

227
00:42:36,380 --> 00:43:21,659
Was it star drop? I have forever a sour face after that one. I love Game Boy. He looks so

228
00:43:21,659 --> 00:43:33,800
ugly in that E mode. Guys, you want to do something? Sure. You know how easy it is to make yourself

229
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:40,599
look ugly? You go like this. Wait, hold on. That's looking where that is. That's bullshit.

230
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:52,309
It's very easy to make yourself ugly. This is what I normally look like. Like this. This is a

231
00:43:52,309 --> 00:44:00,039
fucking normal person. If you scrunch your face up and press your lips into your jaw and pull your

232
00:44:00,039 --> 00:44:05,989
nose back and close your eyes and scrunch your head, you can make yourself look ugly. Look at

233
00:44:05,989 --> 00:44:18,059
all these emotes of me doing. Look, I'll show you. Ready? This is normal. Then see what happens to

234
00:44:18,059 --> 00:45:08,860
my nose. I don't know how to play Dr. Mario. Did I do it? Is it four or is it? I just spoiled all

235
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:24,630
the Metroid. I'm not going to play it anymore. 6,500 people have watched you do that. I had a full

236
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:30,570
diaper of fucking slime. You think anything is going to embarrass me at this point? Think about

237
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:38,489
that. I was in a fucking diaper on stream with slime in my ass. You think that me making a face

238
00:45:38,489 --> 00:45:48,059
on camera is going to make me embarrassed that 6,500 people saw that? At this point, it's over.

239
00:45:48,699 --> 00:45:58,920
You were wearing clothes. Oh, what's this? Got it. Got it. What's the matter, Otto? What do you want?

240
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:14,789
What's going on? What's the matter? What are you doing? He's giving me the look. Got him. Oh,

241
00:46:14,789 --> 00:46:27,860
okay. I get to tap it really fast. Pretty good Atari game. Joe Dog. Hold on. I'm in the middle

242
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:43,449
of a fucking micro game. Is that game good? That's F-Zero, right? Joe Dog for best of 2020.

243
00:46:46,389 --> 00:47:00,070
Let me beat this first. Look out. Oh, it's Mr. Game and Watch. Game. Type two. Type one? What?

244
00:47:00,789 --> 00:47:13,420
I don't understand. Shoot it. What the fuck? I don't even know. All right. Hold on.

245
00:47:18,389 --> 00:47:23,539
What's the matter? What do you need? You want to go out? He wants to do something. Hold on.

246
00:47:25,269 --> 00:47:57,800
Give me Otto. Yeah, he wants to go out. You want to say hi first, Otto? Say hello. Otto! He's like,

247
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:33,800
get me out of this room. All right. I'll be right back. Let me take him out. He's going to come.

248
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:55,139
Kim's going to take care of it. Joe Kim. Hey, everybody get in here. Everybody get in my room.

249
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:25,219
That one's just thick. Wait, I failed it? I thought it said don't. Wasn't it just don't get hit?

250
00:49:25,219 --> 00:49:33,820
My face game is fucking huge. It's shrinking. That's way too big. That's so big. That's

251
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:50,340
obnoxiously huge. I got to kind of focus. Hello? Microscopic. Make it bigger. No.

252
00:49:51,139 --> 00:51:07,030
Put the game in your mouth. Don't. The things I fucking do. Can you see? Can you guys see?

253
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:46,519
Can you guys? I can't. It's hard for me to do this. You shouldn't be able to still hear it.

254
00:51:46,519 --> 00:52:07,719
That was fun. Oh, sorry. Sorry. I can't play the game like that. It's impossible.

255
00:52:07,719 --> 00:52:33,929
That's physically not possible. Smaller. No. Am I bad at that? What, bad at pretending to

256
00:52:33,929 --> 00:52:55,099
put the video game in my mouth and play micro games that are on another screen? Stop whining.

257
00:52:55,099 --> 00:53:17,579
That's all I do. You look more naked with this jacket on. That doesn't make any fucking sense

258
00:53:17,579 --> 00:53:22,699
at all. It's got clothes on. If I had a t-shirt on, you know, I'm naked under the t-shirt.

259
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:28,019
You know, with a t-shirt on, I'm naked under the t-shirt. This is just a shirt.

260
00:53:28,019 --> 00:53:39,860
How am I more naked with this with this zip up on? He's blushing. All right, here we go. Speed up.

261
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:43,940
I'm going to beat this one now. I don't want any more people making fun of me,

262
00:53:44,500 --> 00:54:07,190
but they're going to get the band. Shoot it. Just shoot any of them. All right. Shoot it.

263
00:54:10,570 --> 00:54:19,510
So you admit you're naked. No, you got three lives. I'm going to, I'm going to knock this

264
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:52,539
one out of the park. I fucking don't like it. Speed up again. Damn. This is hard. Hit six.

265
00:54:56,309 --> 00:55:30,360
Oh, it's body. Where the fuck did that even go? You can't say the F word on the internet. You

266
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:40,139
can't say the fuck word on the internet. Yes, I can. P Q R S. What? Oh, I beat it. I love this guy.

267
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:48,070
Match. Okay. That took me a little while. I didn't know what I wanted to be doing.

268
00:55:51,909 --> 00:56:07,980
Shoes. I don't care. Who cares about pressing the button? Decide. Decide what? What am I deciding on?

269
00:56:09,019 --> 00:56:33,860
What am I deciding on? That was cute. That was really cute. Oh, right. Because they spin.

270
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:43,510
I thought it was going to like just press A. Oh, you're going to, okay. You press them.

271
00:56:45,269 --> 00:57:08,179
Search. What am I looking for? I got it right there. I just found them. Remember. Right down.

272
00:57:09,539 --> 00:57:19,059
Hey, what the hell was going on there? Three. That's it. Just only three. Yeah. I got it. Yeah.

273
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:32,710
It's a three. Oh, fuck. The extra hand, the extra finger there. I was why it was like this.

274
00:57:33,590 --> 00:57:36,630
And it was like that. And I just, I, you know what I'm saying? It was like that.

275
00:57:36,630 --> 00:57:47,380
And I just picked them up with a three. I Q. I clicked before the thing got heavier. This one,

276
00:57:48,780 --> 00:58:17,699
it's bigger turtles, right? Three picks four. I know. I don't like that one. Most wins.

277
00:58:18,579 --> 00:58:33,349
What do you mean most wins? Oh, I see. Okay. Whoever has more. Choo. Are you hiding poop line?

278
00:58:33,349 --> 00:58:38,150
Yes. It's in a cup. It's not see through because I've got sick and tired of people making fun of my

279
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:53,000
fucking shit line. There's a teddy bear. That's just a regular cup now. Dribble is. Dribble is.

280
00:58:58,630 --> 00:59:04,090
Inspect. I don't know what the fuck it was. I think it was the guy's face.

281
00:59:05,050 --> 00:59:31,320
Oh, I'm deciding which one doesn't belong. I get it. Dribble is Dribble. Dribble is Dribble.

282
00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:53,449
Okay. You just have to Dribble is phrase search or what? I don't know. What the hell was that even

283
00:59:53,449 --> 01:00:15,000
asking me to do? Or leap forward while holding a press. That's it. Okay. I did it right. Watch out.

284
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Oh, I was trying to stay there. I held it down for too long. I was trying to stay in that spot.

285
01:00:19,719 --> 01:00:26,949
Match. All right. It's got to flip. It can only be this one. Hey, I did it a little too far. I

286
01:00:26,949 --> 01:01:10,489
Super Mario panic jumped. Like he went over there. Count. Oh, inspect it. Q. What the fuck are you

287
01:01:10,489 --> 01:01:18,039
talking about? Right left. Right left. Right left. What the fuck? I did right left. I did right.

288
01:01:18,039 --> 01:01:29,420
Right was wrong apparently. What the fuck happened? Right left. That's what I did. All right. It's an

289
01:01:29,420 --> 01:02:07,590
apple or a tomato. Either one. What was wrong with that one? Okay. There was like small little ice

290
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:39,159
cubes in there and it's freaking me out. Three. Stop squishing him. He'll be fine. She still has

291
01:02:39,159 --> 01:02:48,300
the microphone attachment on. Why didn't why would I take it off? What if I need it? It's a piece of

292
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:58,550
plastic that just clicks on right down. I got it. You guys act like it's just like surgically

293
01:02:58,550 --> 01:03:15,829
implanted on here. Look, it's off. It was very difficult to take off. Dude, it only works with

294
01:03:15,829 --> 01:03:31,099
five games. I know. What a catastrophic failure that a Repro was. Save him. I don't understand.

295
01:03:33,739 --> 01:04:10,760
God. Is it orange? Yep. I can do shapes. Thankfully, that one's very easy. Ah,

296
01:04:15,559 --> 01:04:39,610
heavier. Widen the webcam. Why? Can we wide screen? What are we looking for? Which cat? Which cat?

297
01:04:39,610 --> 01:04:43,380
Which cat? Where is it? Where? Where? Where? Where? All right. I almost got this one done.

298
01:04:43,940 --> 01:05:06,010
Boss time. Speed up again. There's four. That one. The coffee bean. Praise. This game is cool. This

299
01:05:06,010 --> 01:05:11,940
bat is cool. This game is cool. Oh, that dribble was a character's name. That's okay. I thought

300
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:22,039
dribble was a character. Out wit. Oh, it's Hungra. You can attack now. What will you do?

301
01:05:24,519 --> 01:05:29,980
Left jab. That hurt it a bit. Hungra is attacking. What will you do?

302
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:45,539
Crouch. Try using magic. What will you use? Curse. Curse. Last chance. Time it and press A.

303
01:05:47,769 --> 01:05:51,690
Okay, success. I almost just pressed A on failure. That would have been very bad.

304
01:05:52,789 --> 01:06:06,619
You failed. Hungra. Get it. Want to dance? Nothing in there anymore. All right. Dr.

305
01:06:06,619 --> 01:06:27,179
Prigor. Wait, do I have to press A when pinched? One. Okay. Cut. Eat. Oh, I want a T. How do I get a

306
01:06:27,179 --> 01:06:53,190
T? What a strange game. All right. Let me get this one without even having to stop. Oh, look at this.

307
01:06:53,190 --> 01:07:07,769
I love that. I'm going to do like the JPEG with the face and stuff. Eat. Pray. Now the little dog

308
01:07:07,769 --> 01:07:20,650
ones. When they make the ears like a little animation. Fight. Build up. I don't. Okay.

309
01:07:20,650 --> 01:07:29,639
Build up. Does this only play with one button? It's played with a couple. Like two. A. Up,

310
01:07:29,639 --> 01:07:41,190
down, left, right. That's typically how it works. This one's called reality. Oh, fuck.

311
01:07:42,070 --> 01:08:03,380
Can I restart? Connect. That was easy. I'm looking forward to the super insane

312
01:08:05,239 --> 01:08:13,769
times 10 speed one. Pick a hand. Wait, is that assuming that the other one? Pick a hand?

313
01:08:14,730 --> 01:08:39,289
Hunt. Probably A. Smash two. Eat. All right. This is where we have to pay attention. Get it.

314
01:08:48,119 --> 01:08:54,460
Did I get it? Okay. Oh, just barely. It's okay. He's still edible.

315
01:08:55,340 --> 01:09:21,699
Bidet. Level up. What does that mean? What does that mean I'm doing too good? Oh, it means I'm

316
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:35,850
doing good. Nice. Oh, got it. Repel. I don't even know what the fuck he's talking about. A, left,

317
01:09:35,850 --> 01:09:46,779
right, move. I can't even. The day means doing good. Plate. All right. Almost there. Watch out.

318
01:09:47,579 --> 01:10:14,819
There are only five buttons. A lot if you think about it. Yes. The devil. I only need to get one.

319
01:10:14,819 --> 01:10:37,619
Okay. That's the one I had to get. Here we go. Boss fight. Defend. I'm a vase? Oh, shit. Holy fuck.

320
01:10:39,500 --> 01:11:39,289
Don't move. I did it. Cell tower noise. Must. Take. Break. Cat and Ana. Wow, there's no video game

321
01:11:39,289 --> 01:11:51,939
with the slug. Oh, the snail. I want that game. Cover. Press A during cutscene. Yeah, I want. Oh,

322
01:11:51,939 --> 01:12:03,670
okay. He has to press a button when it comes up. Shoot. I want more picture games. Remember that

323
01:12:03,670 --> 01:12:11,350
game Africa? It was so fun. That game was so much fun. Just taking photos and getting raided on them

324
01:12:11,350 --> 01:12:26,970
and stuff. I so badly want to play another one of those. Borrow. Oh. Get in the water?

325
01:12:27,609 --> 01:12:54,220
This one's not that bad. Scare him. Pokemon Snap. Yeah, we can do that. What does it want me to do?

326
01:12:54,220 --> 01:13:06,390
Clear? Oh, like hit it in the wood? I'll play Pokemon Snap. It's not that fun. Oh, you gotta

327
01:13:08,619 --> 01:13:31,619
hit it right in the center. Good day job, dude. Got it. Mad because bad. He's mad because bad.

328
01:13:31,619 --> 01:13:56,390
Mad because bad. Mad because bad. Catch. Oh, what? He caught it. He caught it. I'm trying to. He's

329
01:13:56,390 --> 01:14:29,460
the analog. No more analog. Bad because mad. Mad because analog. Analog. Analog. We're good. Nice.

330
01:14:35,899 --> 01:14:48,060
Got it. He's molding. Why do you? How do you? Where do you get that idea?

331
01:14:49,539 --> 01:15:22,359
I'd love that creature. I want it. That one was tricky. Speed up. Micro-malled.

332
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:51,930
Get off my fucking screen. Finish. Oh, there's another classic turbo web stream. Which one

333
01:15:51,930 --> 01:16:02,090
I'm supposed to lick? Which one was I supposed to lick? I'll get it. I'll get it this time. This is

334
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:22,920
the one. This is the one. I thought the other one. I thought the one in the middle was going to move.

335
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:28,600
Why does it keep doing Game Boy Advance? Is this a port? No, it's not. This one came out for the

336
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:47,720
GameCube. Exclusively for the GameCube. It is. It is. It is literally a Game Boy Advance game.

337
01:16:50,420 --> 01:17:10,039
Wasn't it literally made for every other console? The GBA version is better.

338
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:19,960
Well, we're playing this one. Catch Fruit. What does the bottom of the screen say? It says

339
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:29,210
Game Boy Advance. It says Game Boy Advance at the bottom. Yeah, but it's pretending to be a Game Boy

340
01:17:36,260 --> 01:18:00,789
flying rat. I know. Stop pretending. I almost fucked that up. All right, I got it. No, fuck

341
01:18:00,789 --> 01:18:48,470
ups. Here we go. Got to get a ball. Fight. Oh, that was risky, but I did it. Here we go. Jump.

342
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:45,819
I'm not going for more than one at a time. That's a mistake. All right. Don't call me a coward.

343
01:19:45,819 --> 01:19:51,699
All right. Is this the end of the game here? Is this the final level? Am I about to beat the game?

344
01:19:52,340 --> 01:20:03,930
I'm about to beat the game. Am I? Anything goes Wario. Anything goes Wario. Oh, okay.

345
01:20:03,930 --> 01:20:31,880
People have nightmares about that shit. Catch. That's a broken fucking nose. Oh.

346
01:20:36,250 --> 01:20:46,170
Wrestle. What? I don't know. I was supposed to go for it. Crush it. We're going to have to restart

347
01:20:46,170 --> 01:21:26,810
this one. Never thumb wrestled. Anything goes. Compete. Munch. You're going to lost a pinball.

348
01:21:26,810 --> 01:21:33,829
Of course I did. Create. All right. He's just going to throw a bunch of shit on his face.

349
01:21:35,270 --> 01:22:09,479
Raze. All right. Speed up. Oh, he's a beetle. That's disgusting. Wrestle. Be nice to beetles.

350
01:22:10,039 --> 01:22:13,399
I like beetles. They're cool. They're fine. What's wrong with beetles?

351
01:22:19,850 --> 01:22:43,930
Hide. Oh, hide your fucking stomach. Level up. Oh, I thought I had to tap A to go faster or left or

352
01:22:43,930 --> 01:23:20,199
I don't know. Dude. Did I get it? You got to get Wario's eyes. That's correct. I'm going to get 25

353
01:23:20,199 --> 01:23:32,859
and then I'm doing the super 100. What? If you do it too much or fast his belly button shoots out.

354
01:23:33,739 --> 01:24:19,319
I'm doing super 100 after this for sure. It's going a little too fast. Literally can't beat it.

355
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:56,949
Got him. Got him. Get all those cherries. You fucking idiot. What am I grabbing? I don't even

356
01:24:56,949 --> 01:25:24,890
know what the fuck I'm supposed to grab. This is the one. You notice how pinball and pinwheel

357
01:25:24,890 --> 01:25:38,500
are related. It's full of the word pin in the product. Thank you. Thank you. What am I producing

358
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:57,579
egg salad for? Egg salad. What is that? What are you talking about? Egg salad. Say it. Egg salad.

359
01:25:59,859 --> 01:26:28,100
I suck. I almost messed that one up. He said it. Who said it? I said it? Egg salad. Egg salad. Wait.

360
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:50,899
Okay. He's talking. I know. Didn't fuck that one up. What? I had to do both. Smash. What am I?

361
01:26:51,699 --> 01:28:03,539
I got it. Fuck it. Wait for me. Tuber face. Yeah. I did the like. Fuck. Close it. Egg salad.

362
01:28:03,539 --> 01:28:21,020
It's Wario going. Egg salad. Okay. I see you. Weirdos. He still hasn't beat it. It's the final

363
01:28:21,020 --> 01:28:26,659
level of the game. Of course it's going to be challenging. What does his face look like?

364
01:28:27,539 --> 01:28:42,279
I almost jumped over it. Fuck. Weirdos. Weirdos. Weirdos. My whole body. My whole body is itching.

365
01:28:43,000 --> 01:29:10,180
He hates us. What are you talking about? Take the jacket off. Yeah. It must be this jacket.

366
01:29:10,180 --> 01:29:29,350
Should I take the jacket off? I don't understand this one at all. It says smash. But this is like

367
01:29:29,350 --> 01:30:13,930
a. I don't know. Can I move forward? Nice. Excellent. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's funny.

368
01:30:19,859 --> 01:30:30,140
Take the jacket off. I'm not taking the jacket off. I'm not going to take the jacket off.

369
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:47,340
I'm not going to. I'm not taking the jacket off. I don't get it. I don't. I don't get it. I can

370
01:30:47,340 --> 01:31:19,500
move. It's smash. Take it off. I'll do anything. He fucking flew by level up. What website do you

371
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:35,689
think you're on? What do you think? What do you think you are right now? All right. Almost there.

372
01:31:35,689 --> 01:32:00,819
Come on. Sixteen. You gotta get. I fucked it up. I fucked it up. I fucked it up.

373
01:32:02,579 --> 01:32:44,359
Take off your prosthetic mask. I'm not messing this one up again. Take the wig off.

374
01:32:49,350 --> 01:32:53,430
I hit the button at the wrong fucking time. At the wrong time. I'm trying not to hit the wrong time.

375
01:32:54,390 --> 01:33:18,739
That's not rock, paper, scissors. That's one, two, three, four, five. Remove your glass eye.

376
01:33:19,460 --> 01:33:25,779
What if I just like pulled a fucking prosthetic neck and shit? Like seven of my teeth came out.

377
01:33:26,420 --> 01:33:31,699
One of my fucking eyes comes out. The wig comes off and like my jaw. Like I've just got a ton

378
01:33:31,699 --> 01:34:07,819
of stuff on. I don't get it. I don't get it. I get it out. Fucking analog. You're really

379
01:34:07,819 --> 01:34:58,949
fucking me up here. Speed up again. All right. Let's go. One shot for this. Go. Dodge. Watch out.

380
01:35:11,159 --> 01:36:03,180
My eyes. Heck. My eyes. My eyes are burning. Why? Okay. We're good. I'm fine. Wrong dummy.

381
01:36:36,739 --> 01:37:12,810
Is there a cut scene? Oh, his TV reception. Finally, his TV is back. The coffee looks good.

382
01:37:13,770 --> 01:37:24,619
I want one. There's no fucking water in here. Are there harder levels? Are there secret levels

383
01:37:24,619 --> 01:37:39,109
in this one? Are there not? There's no like secret hard levels? There's no like super 100?

384
01:37:44,010 --> 01:37:53,699
At least I'm not even gonna leave it out loud. Every micro game has three levels of difficulty.

385
01:37:54,979 --> 01:38:10,390
Can I start at level three? What the hell is going on in this cut scene? Oh shit. Stage clear.

386
01:38:10,390 --> 01:38:19,829
Character intros. Movie matters. Thrilling. Hard. All mixed up. Thrilling. Let's try thrilling.

387
01:38:19,829 --> 01:38:33,479
Okay. Why is it starting at 81? Oh man. He's gonna get us all.

388
01:38:46,659 --> 01:38:54,600
On a Ritz cracker. Oh my god. The link. Which is what's up. It's a sandwich. A sandwich. A sandwich.

389
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:57,479
A sandwich. A sandwich. A sandwich. A sandwich. A sandwich. A sandwich. This one. You gotta do

390
01:38:57,479 --> 01:39:01,159
more than one? What the fuck? Oh my god. Okay. You gotta do more than one. What's what's what?

391
01:39:01,159 --> 01:39:08,970
What do you want to click on? Yeah. I know. Yes. Sure. You took a photo and you like did the the

392
01:39:08,970 --> 01:39:13,369
smudge tool and you smudged my eye over there by like 5%. All right. That's fine.

393
01:39:14,170 --> 01:39:38,810
On to the scan. That's a tiny little spot. Look at the clip. It's real. It's not fucking real.

394
01:39:38,810 --> 01:39:44,329
You took you took the smudge tool and you smudged my left eye by like 40% the other direction.

395
01:39:44,329 --> 01:40:07,819
It's not real. It's not real. I know it's not real. Put on the clip. I will in a minute.

396
01:40:23,350 --> 01:40:29,880
Look at the clip. Look at the clip. Holy shit. That's fucked up. That's fucked up.

397
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:41,640
It's not real. This only works one time. Okay. This only works once before I catch on to the

398
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:47,100
bullshit. That's not real. Watch the clip. All right. I'll watch the clip. Give me the clip.

399
01:40:47,100 --> 01:40:53,260
Where is it? You got this. You got this clip to prove that this is real. Where is the clip then?

400
01:40:54,060 --> 01:41:03,989
I don't see you clip it in my office. I don't want to click on that one. That one's got like

401
01:41:03,989 --> 01:41:12,340
a fucked up title. What's with the title on that one? Why is that one so fucking weird?

402
01:41:16,119 --> 01:41:29,289
I don't want to click. That one's freaking me out. You're freaking me out. How to make

403
01:41:29,289 --> 01:42:09,739
yourself look ugly. There is no clip. You guys are a bunch of liars. All right.

404
01:42:14,970 --> 01:42:26,310
I can't do those. Am I using the filter to make your eyes look more blue?

405
01:42:29,130 --> 01:42:36,899
What? I'm not like a fucking psycho. I'm going to put a filter on today to make my eyes look

406
01:42:36,899 --> 01:42:46,810
wicked fucking blue. What are you talking about? I got bullied into putting the cam on in the first

407
01:42:46,810 --> 01:43:05,609
place. Perfect. Guys, this is not a purple twitch hoodie. This is a blue twitch hoodie.

408
01:43:05,609 --> 01:43:11,800
They made different colors. Excuse me. This is blue. It's not purple. It's a deep blue.

409
01:43:12,439 --> 01:43:28,710
What game is it though? What game is it though? I hope it's fucking, I don't know. Six. Count them.

410
01:43:29,270 --> 01:43:39,689
Jack, it's going to be unzipped. Hey, you know, they're getting rid of it. Oh, they go.

411
01:43:44,300 --> 01:44:13,770
Ooh, that was close. Shoot. It's such a tiny little area. The pig is cute. Yeah. What are those

412
01:44:13,770 --> 01:44:27,340
noises from? What are those noises from? That like, what is that from? No, no, it's from like,

413
01:44:27,340 --> 01:44:32,859
it's from a, what game is it from? No, no, it's not. No, it's not. No, it's not. Give me the right one.

414
01:44:32,859 --> 01:44:38,180
This is not from this one. Those noises. I can, I can, I can, I can smell those noises.

415
01:44:38,659 --> 01:44:52,090
I've heard them a million times before in like an NES game. Bubble Bobble? Yeah, maybe. Not Yoshi.

416
01:44:52,090 --> 01:45:09,060
No, no, no, no, no. Bubble Bobble? Yeah, definitely. Pugs Bunny and Crazy Castle.

417
01:45:14,840 --> 01:45:50,569
Check that shit out. Pipe E. Ooh. Pipe E? I don't know. I don't know. I don't, I don't know what it

418
01:45:50,569 --> 01:45:56,329
wants me to do. I know it's the ones, the ones that are spinning. And so when you do this,

419
01:45:56,329 --> 01:45:59,850
what you're trying to do is you're trying to spread it up. Blue shadow will make it so

420
01:46:00,409 --> 01:46:03,529
it'll accentuate your eyes. And then what you're going to do is you're going to take the blush

421
01:46:03,529 --> 01:46:07,050
brush right here and you're going to add it to this part and you're going to give yourself a

422
01:46:07,050 --> 01:46:18,699
nice little shine here. Fucking damn it. I want to beat this. Oh my fucking God. And

423
01:46:33,029 --> 01:46:39,140
this is a celebrity meltdown. I'm not a celebrity. Where do you get this idea of a celebrity?

424
01:46:45,979 --> 01:47:03,300
Celebrity? He's an E-celebrity. Just press every button. It doesn't matter. You're a top 10

425
01:47:03,300 --> 01:47:13,050
Twitch streamer. Is that even accurate? You have 7,000 people watch you several times a week.

426
01:47:15,689 --> 01:47:20,659
Well, I'm glad you think I'm a celebrity. Which way do I go?

427
01:47:22,869 --> 01:47:26,789
There was no way to go. He's dead no matter what. He's just fucking dead.

428
01:47:27,590 --> 01:47:45,159
Let me try hard. Don't inflate his ego. I have to get at least 25. Otherwise I

429
01:47:45,479 --> 01:47:55,579
refuse to stop playing until I get to 25. I have to. If you're a celebrity, why did you ignore me?

430
01:47:55,579 --> 01:47:58,380
Why didn't you ignore me at the grocery store? Wait, what are you talking about?

431
01:47:59,340 --> 01:48:05,539
Is this this this this this this this thing again? All like you're doing now? Yeah. Right.

432
01:48:05,539 --> 01:48:09,399
Something. Whatever. Something. Whatever the fuck you. Whatever. You know the thing.

433
01:48:09,960 --> 01:48:26,260
The coffee pasta. Yes. Electrical interference. Yeah.

434
01:48:29,989 --> 01:48:30,869
Excellent.

435
01:48:44,260 --> 01:48:58,939
25. Here it is. Thank you. Whoa. Eating BLT right now. Tish is like.

436
01:49:04,649 --> 01:49:10,569
I like actually. I like actually. Actually timed that person out for like 30 minutes. That was

437
01:49:10,569 --> 01:49:21,779
fucking outrageous. But I give that person like at least 10 minutes to think about what they've said.

438
01:49:21,779 --> 01:49:29,449
Like you've got to think about what you've said there. I'd like for you to press like tab up

439
01:49:29,449 --> 01:49:33,529
and see the last thing that you wrote. I'd like you to sit there in your 10 minutes of

440
01:49:33,529 --> 01:49:41,350
silence and solitude here to say yeah I think this is this is worth other people reading this.

441
01:49:45,609 --> 01:49:51,460
I want you to read. I want you to really sit there and process each word and then come back to us

442
01:49:51,460 --> 01:49:59,560
with your assessment after we after you're back from the band. What did he say? Something. Something

443
01:49:59,560 --> 01:50:05,720
fucking heinous. Just so disgusting and heinous that like they we have to they have to be you

444
01:50:05,720 --> 01:50:17,430
have to be punished. Where did it go? What do you think about what you've done?

445
01:50:18,859 --> 01:50:24,390
Nobody knows what you're talking about. Only one person needs to know and it's the person

446
01:50:24,390 --> 01:50:40,420
that said the naughty thing. A perv abandon. What the fuck do you think is going to happen?

447
01:50:41,140 --> 01:50:44,779
What do you think is going to happen? Hold on. I'm bad at these.

448
01:51:13,689 --> 01:51:32,600
Slow mode. Slow mode. Slow mode. Help us. Slow mode. Help us. Did I lose? Hey Bowser. Get the

449
01:51:32,600 --> 01:51:47,210
heck out of here. Perfect pixel. Nobody said slow mode. I did. Double finger in the nose.

450
01:51:47,210 --> 01:52:10,359
That's hard. Watch it you PG-13 ass. Yep. He's never going to get to 25. Yes he is. All right.

451
01:52:11,079 --> 01:52:27,420
No. Get the fuck out of here. Where is this one? Oh look at you. Oh look at you. Oh look at you

452
01:52:27,420 --> 01:52:30,939
guys. I'm eating. What are you eating? What do you want to say? I think you're eating a bacon,

453
01:52:30,939 --> 01:52:41,590
lettuce, and fucking tomato sandwich. Hey look at you Lindsay. Look at me. This game is

454
01:52:44,149 --> 01:52:56,470
intriguing. Can I just be very clear about something? The BLT is a dog shit sandwich.

455
01:52:57,189 --> 01:53:03,029
It's just a condiment fucking sandwich. It's just where's the thing that goes underneath all that?

456
01:53:05,130 --> 01:53:08,409
Lettuce, tomato, and bacon with bread. Where's the thing that goes underneath it?

457
01:53:09,210 --> 01:53:17,819
That's what a scam of a sandwich. Like imagine if you went to like a sub shop and you paid eight

458
01:53:17,819 --> 01:53:22,460
dollars for a large BLT and eight dollars for like a large chicken palm. You're getting way more

459
01:53:22,460 --> 01:53:33,399
fucking food telecommunicated down into your esophagus. BLT. And then people do what? BMT is

460
01:53:33,399 --> 01:53:38,970
what people do. This game is groovy. Bacon, meat, and tomato. It's like just call it a fucking

461
01:53:38,970 --> 01:53:57,939
regular sandwich. Oh my god that's hard. If you put egg on there that's no that's a substantial

462
01:53:57,939 --> 01:54:02,659
addition then but why would you know but lettuce, tomato, and on a lettuce on an egg sandwich.

463
01:54:03,479 --> 01:54:17,590
I wouldn't eat a lettuce egg sandwich. I wouldn't eat lettuce eggs. An egg like a bacon, egg, and

464
01:54:17,590 --> 01:54:32,840
cheese sandwich with lettuce on it. I'm not gonna eat a bacon, tomato, and lettuce, cheese, and egg

465
01:54:32,840 --> 01:54:54,149
sandwich on like a croissant. Starbucks sandwich. Oh Starbucks sandwich. No Starbucks sandwich is

466
01:54:54,149 --> 01:55:12,100
like an egg white tomato paste wrap with feta cheese, spinach, and avocado oil in it. What's

467
01:55:12,100 --> 01:55:22,859
wrong with feta? Nothing. Spinach feta wrap is 10 out of 10. I'm not I don't understand the egg

468
01:55:22,859 --> 01:55:29,260
white thing. I want I want I want the fucking I want the B vitamins and I want the I want the

469
01:55:30,300 --> 01:55:48,260
fun part. Did I really not get it? High cholesterol. Yeah yeah yeah oh high cholesterol yeah you got

470
01:55:48,260 --> 01:55:52,979
a high cholesterol. It's and that's in so many studies proving that the cholesterol in the egg

471
01:55:52,979 --> 01:55:57,060
yolks is really not even a big fucking deal and all the vitamins and all the nutrients you get from

472
01:55:57,060 --> 01:56:04,899
the egg yolk are are so much better than you deleting it from your life. You know you know

473
01:56:04,899 --> 01:56:20,579
how many studies there have been to prove what I'm saying correct? Am I ever gonna get 25?

474
01:56:40,380 --> 01:56:44,859
Return. Webcam is desynced. I'm sure it is.

475
01:56:49,430 --> 01:57:06,149
I'm trying. One guy said that. I thought we synced it up alright well. Chat stop you are killing

476
01:57:06,149 --> 01:57:29,510
Jerma. Quick stretch of webcam. I got eaten by the ground. What the fuck? Alright I'm gonna

477
01:57:29,510 --> 01:57:35,319
do this three more times. This one doesn't count. This one doesn't count. This one doesn't count.

478
01:57:35,319 --> 01:57:59,079
That didn't count. That one didn't count. Have I done anything on thrilling mode?

479
01:58:00,680 --> 01:58:11,699
Um I think this isn't this is thrilling mode. Where we are now. Still on the pig level. Omega

480
01:58:11,699 --> 01:58:35,350
lol. Let me get to 25. Praise. Great. Decide. Yeah okay they're doing it's going the other way.

481
01:58:36,069 --> 01:58:39,340
That's where it's like that the battle of rain thing when you're looking at logging up it goes

482
01:58:39,340 --> 01:58:55,859
the other way. Break. Holy shit that was absolutely pogfix. Which one? All the way to the right.

483
01:58:58,710 --> 01:59:10,539
Settle down. Settle down. And go.

484
01:59:10,539 --> 02:01:09,770
Shit. No emotion for five minutes. Where is it? Where is it? Square. Square. Square. Square.

485
02:01:10,810 --> 02:01:20,300
It's got a resting gamer face. Figured if I maybe I just didn't move. What do you mean? I just did

486
02:01:20,300 --> 02:01:26,539
it. I pressed up. It was up up down. I pressed up first. What the hell? I don't understand. I

487
02:01:26,539 --> 02:01:44,539
pressed up. I pressed up. I did press up. I pressed it. Go back in the bottom. Look. I said I pressed

488
02:01:44,539 --> 02:01:47,100
it. That means I pressed it. I said it. If you look at the bot I said it right after I did it.

489
02:01:47,899 --> 02:01:58,489
He's still going. I'm trying. I'm interested. This is the hard. This is insane mode. This is

490
02:01:58,489 --> 02:02:16,890
thrilling mode. I gotta get to at least 25. I have to. Streaming for 2,000 more years.

491
02:02:25,939 --> 02:02:46,020
That was tricky. I don't know. This side. Yeah. That went in an extra medium turtle. All right. 10.

492
02:02:50,180 --> 02:02:58,680
Oh. I thought he was gonna hurt me if I touched him. I thought he was gonna hurt me if I touched

493
02:02:58,680 --> 02:03:06,630
him. I don't know. Okay. I'm choking. I know. But it's hard. Not a leaf. That's a butterfly.

494
02:03:13,430 --> 02:03:49,819
Eight. Damn. That's fucking hard. Come on. That one's hard to determine. That one's hard to

495
02:03:49,819 --> 02:04:14,409
determine. I did it right. You just have a whole wheelie. But I got the 19s the highest. Give me

496
02:04:14,409 --> 02:04:38,520
some easy ones in a row. The poop. That guy's back. What'd he say? What'd they say? They came

497
02:04:38,520 --> 02:04:54,739
back and just said poop. That's it? That's okay. Just don't fucking do that. Don't do that again.

498
02:05:11,050 --> 02:05:20,039
He mocked you. You don't. All right. You don't want to come into the king's court with a stick

499
02:05:20,039 --> 02:05:25,720
this big. It's this small. It's like a twig that you broke off fucking like a tree. You came before

500
02:05:25,720 --> 02:05:30,119
into coming into my court and you're gonna be like hey I've got something to say to you and

501
02:05:30,119 --> 02:05:35,960
you're talking about the king that has like a plus 200 damage like lightning enchanted great sword

502
02:05:35,960 --> 02:05:42,489
that is as tall as the ceiling and it's as light as a small baseball bat and I just literally have

503
02:05:42,489 --> 02:05:48,810
to go like this and I fucking cast lightning down like Legend of Zelda on you and and I don't think

504
02:05:48,810 --> 02:05:54,229
you want to do that. I've got an incredibly powerful sword versus your less powerful twig.

505
02:05:55,189 --> 02:06:16,069
He's what? He's a king? Ego maniac. What? What? That's overcompensating. How so? I got what?

506
02:06:16,069 --> 02:06:22,470
Because I have this huge fucking gigantic sword that's bigger than everybody else's and I can

507
02:06:23,109 --> 02:06:27,909
okay that might be all right so the sword is the sword is not as high as tall as the ceiling. The

508
02:06:27,909 --> 02:06:33,189
sword is like this big. No fuck the sword. It's a it's a fucking magician's wand. It's a magician's

509
02:06:33,270 --> 02:06:36,789
wand. It's this big. It's small and it can fit in my hand. It's like a Harry Potter's wand. You

510
02:06:36,789 --> 02:06:41,670
know what I mean? And I can just be like I could fuck it you disintegrate you. Yeah I just disintegrate

511
02:06:41,670 --> 02:06:44,229
you. You don't want to come to the king's court with a fucking Harry Potter wand. They can

512
02:06:44,229 --> 02:06:47,350
disintegrate you in less than 10 seconds. I don't think you want to do that. You got a fucking tree

513
02:06:47,350 --> 02:06:58,119
off a branch outside. Moving on. Moving on. You don't want to don't you don't want to come fight

514
02:06:58,119 --> 02:07:10,039
the king with the twig when the king's got a fucking great sword. Big bits. Oh I don't have to

515
02:07:10,039 --> 02:07:17,539
I'm gonna I'm gonna I did we just play D&D? Yeah and I've had my D&D character for 30 fucking years.

WarioWare smooth moves game cube edition. He's so rude. Oh yeah. I'm dealing with with with some

524
02:09:03,880 --> 02:09:09,720
stemmed from somebody talking about of them they were going to eat a blt sandwich and and they

525
02:09:09,720 --> 02:09:14,520
it was something about i'm gonna paraphrase here something about how they were like going to eat

526
02:09:14,520 --> 02:09:26,149
it was it was they tasted i'm not even why would i even say it out loud again but i'm the weird

527
02:09:26,149 --> 02:09:35,460
guy i'm dealing with something i'm not saying it that's it's absolutely fucking heinous why would

528
02:09:35,460 --> 02:09:54,180

529
02:09:56,100 --> 02:10:01,460
just remove the bread and you have a cob salad what's the point of the bread the bread just

530
02:10:01,460 --> 02:10:07,460
makes no sense just okay if you're gonna eat a blt just remove the bread and add like some

531
02:10:07,460 --> 02:10:18,710
ceasar dressing and maybe a little bit of romaine done eating a salad with bread blt's don't have
