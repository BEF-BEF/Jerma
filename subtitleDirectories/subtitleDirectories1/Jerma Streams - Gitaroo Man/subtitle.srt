1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:11,140
Comedy Central TV time. Aye yi yi. God damn it. You guys have no idea. I'll wait a little bit for

2
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:17,449
people to come in for me to tell this story. Because to understand the end of the story,

3
00:00:17,449 --> 00:00:25,030
you have to understand the beginning. What is Guitar-O-Man? Oh, you're in for a treat,

4
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:32,329
and so am I. Because I ain't ever played it either. And this is the original Guitar-O-Man.

5
00:00:35,979 --> 00:00:45,829
That's supposed to be the title. The original Guitar-O-Man. This ain't no hacked copy.

6
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:51,350
This ain't the remake that was on PlayStation Portable. This is the original Guitar-O-Man for

7
00:00:51,350 --> 00:01:03,479
PlayStation 2. Am I gonna do a stream on Rhythm Heaven? Maybe. But I wanted to break it up a

8
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:10,359
little bit today. We've been doing horror games. Scary scream-in-your-face games. For the last like

9
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:17,980
two weeks. So I'm like, you know, it's time to break it up and do something a little more

10
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:29,500
light-hearted. So today, we are gonna do Guitar-O-Man. And then tomorrow, we're going to do

11
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:40,939
the new Trine with Star and Ashley. I believe that's what's happening tomorrow. So we're gonna

12
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:47,980
light it up a little bit. And then after that, we're gonna go to the thing. We've got a whole

13
00:01:47,980 --> 00:02:04,090
plan for this next week or two straight. Yes, the thing. What thing? The thing. The thing.

14
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:13,800
But anyways, let's have a little discussion on what happened earlier today. The Three Triners.

15
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,840
That's right. Okay, so like I said, to understand the end of the story, you have to understand the

16
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:26,860
beginning. So as a lot of you know, I've been having some issues lately. Stomach issues.

17
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,740
I've been having stomach pain. I've been having abdominal pain, abdominal cramps, and back pain

18
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:37,979
for the last probably eight months. I've had a colonoscopy. We've gone through like all kinds

19
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:43,099
of stuff. We've gone, I've had a colonoscopy. I'm going in for like another endoscopy of my

20
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:48,219
stomach. I have to get a liver scan. We're trying to find out what the fuck is wrong with me, right?

21
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:52,539
Because it's, I don't, we don't think it's related to colitis. Whatever it is, we're trying to figure

22
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:58,219
it out. So I'm on a couple of new medications, right? And these medications, let's just lay it

23
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:04,939
out there because you have to understand. Let's lay it out there. I don't care. I right now,

24
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:10,139
which we're trying to do a few things, and one of them is to do with my intestines and my stomach.

25
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:17,990
Right now, I am on a prescription grade laxative. Let's get it out there. Like out of what the fuck

26
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:25,719
do I care? One of the reasons why I've had to say, wait, our streams are going to be like

27
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:31,800
four or five hours, four hours this week is because I'm actually on a literal prescription

28
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:39,610
grade laxative. So that's one of the, that's one of the medications I'm on. We're trying something

29
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:48,090
to do. It's, I don't even, I don't even tell you why I just am. Anyways, so I know I'm on all this

30
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:54,810
new medication and I know that I have a liver scan coming up. So I have a liver scan coming up

31
00:03:54,810 --> 00:04:02,900
in a couple of weeks actually. And I woke up this morning. Seemed like a pretty normal morning,

32
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:07,800
right? Yeah, everything's normal. What's, what's, what's going on here? Just going to get my coffee

33
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,639
and have some fun and just stream. That sounds like, yeah, we're going to stream today too.

34
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:19,079
So those of you that know anything about liver problems, there is a certain condition that can

35
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:26,600
come that can arise when you have a pretty, a liver issue. One of those things is yellowing

36
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:32,939
of the skin. It's called jaundice. So I woke up this morning and I didn't look in the mirror.

37
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:38,379
I hadn't taken like a shower yet. I was making coffee. It was up and down the stairs. So about

38
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:43,339
like an hour and a half or so before I was going to start the stream, I look in the mirror and I

39
00:04:43,339 --> 00:04:52,920
noticed that my skin is yellow, like under my arms was bright Crayola yellow. And I'm going,

40
00:04:53,720 --> 00:05:01,060
no, this is, that's, that's jaundice, right? I'm on this new medication. Is it the new medicine?

41
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:07,779
Oh, okay. I'm, I got to figure this out. What the fuck is happening? So I called Kim and I'm like,

42
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:12,579
Kim, I just want to let you know, I'm probably, I got to go to the doctor. I'm not sure if this

43
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:15,699
is something to do maybe with the liver thing that we were talking about, me and the doctor.

44
00:05:16,339 --> 00:05:20,740
So I, I, I got to go get like something done. I got to get my blood work or something.

45
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:25,939
Okay. So that's what's going to happen. Just want to make sure I'm okay. Everything's fine.

46
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:34,069
And I'm about to literally go to the, to the ER. Like I was going to go to the ER because the

47
00:05:34,069 --> 00:05:37,110
doctor's office, all the doctor's office is closed on the weekends. By the way, why the fuck is that

48
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:45,879
a thing? Why are doctor's offices closed on the weekend? What if you have a problem? But anyways,

49
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:56,439
so I'm like getting re ready to go with my, my yellow skin and I stopped for a second and I,

50
00:05:57,079 --> 00:06:12,620
I take a wet wipe and I start to wipe hard on the places that are yellow and it's coming off.

51
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:23,269
My skin was dyed yellow from a bath I took yesterday. I took a bath last night and,

52
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:34,870
and put in some like a, like, like an oil essential oil thing and it was green. It's

53
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:49,339
from a bath bomb. It was turmeric oil, but you have to understand something. I've been told

54
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:54,100
we need to check your liver. Um, your abdominal pain could be because you, you might have an,

55
00:06:54,100 --> 00:07:00,660
you know, you might have an enlarged liver and liver jaundice and my brain, I'm just going,

56
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:10,300
this is the, this is the, this has to be it. So I dyed my skin yellow accidentally last night,

57
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:19,050
taken a bath bomb bath and I, but it wasn't there. It was not, it was not there.

58
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:27,370
I didn't get out of the bath and I wasn't like yellow. I woke up yellow. I didn't go to bed

59
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:40,300
yellow. Oh, but I, I, I, I, can you imagine if I had gone to the doctor? Yes. What is it? Mr.

60
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:45,500
Hamilton? You've got, unless I see you've got some jaundice there. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. And I

61
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,259
would give him the whole story. Yeah. We're trying to figure it out. I mean, my regular doctor,

62
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:54,060
we're trying to figure out like I'm getting a liver exam, a liver, a scan. We think my liver

63
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:59,100
might be have some problems with it. Um, I've been having abdominal pain and this is all real.

64
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:02,459
And he's like, Oh, come here for a second. Let me take a look at you. Yeah. Let's go,

65
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:09,939
let's put you through a bunch of more tests. And he finds out that I've just like have like

66
00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:14,629
yellow food coloring on me. What is that doctor going to say to me?

67
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:24,339
He's medical grade wet wipes. He's going to be like, uh, Jeremy, did you, are you, uh,

68
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:31,720
did you, did you do this? Why are you have yellow food coloring on you coming to the doctor?

69
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:36,730
Cause if I didn't do that, it would be just as much of a surprise to me as it is to him

70
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:44,070
or them, whatever. Right. It'd be like, I don't know. I don't know what that is. Is that what's

71
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:52,419
going on? I'm confused too. Did, uh, did somebody paint me? Somebody paint my body? I don't know.

72
00:08:52,419 --> 00:09:01,980
Doctor, I don't know what's going on. Imagine having to have that conversation of like, this

73
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:09,850
is you have that's okay. You know, when GameStop employees, uh, tell you about the crazy customer

74
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:16,649
that comes in and like, Oh, it's a GameStop stories dot Reddit, whatever. Right. I would be on the

75
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:22,389
like doctor, like crazy stories subreddit. So I have the guy that came in with, with like the

76
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:35,720
yellow paint on his body telling the doctor he had jaundiced. God damn it. So that was my, uh,

77
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:44,340
that was my afternoon. I canceled the stream. I came in here before the stream started and I

78
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:49,139
canceled it. I was like, guys, I've, I've got like an issue I've got to figure out.

79
00:09:57,059 --> 00:10:01,750
But the reason why this sucks so bad is, and I know that's like funny,

80
00:10:02,629 --> 00:10:07,899
but like at the same time I'm sitting there going, all right, so we still got to figure out what's

81
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:16,039
wrong with me. I still have to go for those exams. You know what I mean? I still am on a prescription

82
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:27,159
grade laxative. You know, that doesn't go away. But anyways, uh, so today we're going to play

83
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:41,899
guitar. Oh man, that's, that was the story. He's fooling his chat live. Like I can't imagine

84
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:45,100
how embarrassing that would be if I, if I actually went to the doctor,

85
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:50,860
he would just take a wet, like a, like a medical grade wet wipe and just go like that and be like,

86
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:58,340
sir, what are you doing here? Like the cost, it would cost so much like money too.

87
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:03,220
Imagine you go to the ER and it's just, you have to wipe your skin with a wet wipe.

88
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:12,899
Oh man. Anyways, we can move on now. I just figured I would let you guys know.

89
00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:20,100
That's why the stream is starting 40 minutes late. Uh, we had some huge, uh, donations coming here.

90
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:29,299
We had Freddy dread gave 10,000 bits, $100, 10,000 bits. Uh, Frig, I can't watch the stream today,

91
00:11:29,299 --> 00:11:39,100
but game hard boss. Oh, this is a hard game. Okay. Thank you for the 10,000 bits. Freddy

92
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:47,320
dread. I'll do my best. It's going to be a relaxing stream. It's all right. And then another thing

93
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:53,720
I've like come to, like, I've come to terms with the fact that shit like that just kind of happens

94
00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:04,330
to me. You know, it's just like, and whatever, it's just another one. He's telling you the

95
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:17,610
game's hard and it's all right. What's this? Somebody's got an image. That's not even what

96
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:27,399
I said. What it's got an amazing man. I misread it. They say, no, it says, uh, Frig, I can't watch

97
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:37,340
the stream today, but game hard boss, like game hard, like game sucks. And they're calling me boss.

98
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:44,740
Is this like a game hard? This game is hard or go for it. You game hard today.

99
00:12:45,379 --> 00:12:53,399
I don't know. I woke up yellow today. Okay. I'm still getting over this. It was like very

100
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:59,340
stressful. I was like, I was like, we're going to call my mother and shit. Like it was, this was

101
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:08,659
daughter, like a very good morning. That's a sentence. Oh, okay. But anyways, thank you,

102
00:13:08,659 --> 00:13:14,100
Freddy dread. And then thank you to, uh, zip. So for the 10 community subs, appreciate that. Thank

103
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:24,009
you. Uh, I cannot do face cam today because, um, it's not plugged in. That's it. I've been

104
00:13:24,009 --> 00:13:27,610
doing a lot of face cam. We're going to, this is, this is, we don't need face cam. This is a,

105
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:32,899
this is a music stream. Speaking of music streams. Why don't we take a look at it?

106
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:43,929
And here it is, or at least it should be there. It's our old man. Hey, yeah. I don't even know

107
00:13:43,929 --> 00:13:51,769
what it sounds like. What does it sound like? Why can I not hear this? Did it just stop?

108
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:06,539
All right. First things first, like we do with every old console game, we need to test to make

109
00:14:06,539 --> 00:14:14,009
sure that you can, that this is synced up. Okay. Here we go. You ready? One, two, three, four,

110
00:14:14,009 --> 00:14:24,899
one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four. We good. All right. So, uh, guitar,

111
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:29,139
old man is a game where you play the guitar and it's a rhythm game. And apparently it's a hard

112
00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:35,350
game. What I've been told from, uh, some of the members of this community, let's give it a try.

113
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:40,230
We got a full motion video cut scene in the beginning. That's good.

114
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:51,110
Hmm. It's Snoopy.

115
00:14:54,149 --> 00:14:58,470
You know, you want, cause he been pecking on you again. You're really like totally useless.

116
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:04,549
Aren't you? Oh, shut up. But you want, there's something you can do about it. I think.

117
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:13,450
Come on, let's go. Give it a shot. Oh, it's going to teach me how to play the guitar on a tennis

118
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:25,539
racket. Me when I'm on prescription grade laxatives. All right. I tell you, I, I, I'm,

119
00:15:25,539 --> 00:15:32,840
I'm all right. I'll be completely transparent with it. All right. Guitar.

120
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:49,190
There's one, two. I don't have one. Head forward. Head. Yeah. Like give yourself a nerd neck.

121
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:55,500
How's that? Feel good. Okay. Lean forward. Same thing with the left stick.

122
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:02,279
Tilt it in any direction and spin around and tilt your head forward. Relax your shoulders.

123
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:23,559
Have bad airflow. It's called the trace line. Okay. Wait, I just have to use the analog.

124
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:34,279
Look, rotate the left analog to follow the trace. Oh shit. Oh man. This isn't going to be hard.

125
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:45,590
This is a hard game boss. When do I get to go like,

126
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:24,019
so you hold it and let it go. Oh Jesus. Okay. I'm ready. I'll try. Oh, this way. Oh shit.

127
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:49,500
Come on. That's better than okay. Wait, that wasn't me doing that. I thought that was me doing that.

128
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,299
Nice. It's Cheeto.

129
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:15,480
I just spilled coffee literally all over my whole body. Give me a break. What a disaster.

130
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:18,119
So how do you use a guitar to fight?

131
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:29,640
First, the charge. The charge is the phase where you gain power. I have like a street fighter meter.

132
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,000
If your timing's off or if the trace line goes out of the blue zone, you won't gain.

133
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:44,839
Next, the battle phase. There's the attack mode in the car. You alternate between them.

134
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,920
What?

135
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:56,119
Okay. Oh no.

136
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:05,930
Thank God this is on PlayStation controller.

137
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:32,890
Here we go. I don't need him to say push.

138
00:19:42,859 --> 00:19:57,660
I mean, you're adorable, but I don't need you to say it. I don't like how they're not colored

139
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:04,069
correctly. Oh, I guess they are. What am I talking about? Red is uh, or yeah, pink is square.

140
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:10,390
I'll be all right.

141
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,819
So wait, do I get to like just strum random stuff?

142
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:28,259
Okay, so don't make mistakes. Easy.

143
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:43,589
Yeah, I just won't make any mistakes. Tutorial boss incoming.

144
00:20:46,569 --> 00:21:32,410
Good. Don't make any mistakes. What? Here we go. Defense. It's just about timing. It's just

145
00:21:32,410 --> 00:22:01,079
right when the beat happens. I'll be really good. Now it's my turn. Oh shit. What did I do?

146
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:20,700
Oh, that's fucking hard when you go around in a circle. What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong?

147
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:31,140
Why are these stuff? I'm big. This is too much. I can't do this.

148
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,920
Dude, you know it's getting real when their mouth turns into a square. That's how you know

149
00:22:46,920 --> 00:23:10,460
shit's hitting the fucking fan. This is real. This is an issue. This is a little issue that I

150
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:16,380
have here. I have an old, I have a, hold on, somebody's coming in the room. Could you just

151
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:21,259
open this jar real quick? Sorry. I'm getting like, I'm getting like jump scared from behind.

152
00:23:21,819 --> 00:23:36,170
Open this jar? How come every time? This is just what I do. Look at that. Thank you. I still got

153
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:49,259
it. Thank you. I still got it. I just opened jars on stream. Sorry about that. The last, okay. I

154
00:23:49,259 --> 00:23:56,809
think the last three Kim appearances on stream have been open the jar. Here comes the dog.

155
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:11,819
Open the jar. I'm fairly certain about that. All right. Here we go. Retry. No, try again. I lost

156
00:24:11,819 --> 00:24:23,509
already? All right. I'm ready. Why do you get full power? What I'm going to say is I have a,

157
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:31,369
I don't have an official PlayStation 2 controller. I can already, I can see an issue here already.

158
00:24:32,410 --> 00:25:22,039
Okay. Excuse me. Let's go. It's very jagged. Yeah. I got it. I got it. I got that right. What

159
00:25:22,039 --> 00:26:02,630
happened? Why do I feel like I'm doing that wrong? Get out of here. Oops. This is actually

160
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:33,269
really fun. I'll tell you one thing though. This takes every single ounce of my concentration.

161
00:26:34,069 --> 00:26:50,069
I don't have room in my brain to speak. Not today. It's taking up every spot in my mind.

162
00:26:50,069 --> 00:27:55,349
The final, here we go. Oh, got it. What? No. You win. Who's the dinosaur?

163
00:27:56,950 --> 00:28:10,970
The game is way too fast. I got a B. I'll take a B. How many misses? Only 4%.

164
00:28:11,849 --> 00:28:21,369
I got mostly good. That's a B. I'll take a B. Replay this game. What? What are you talking

165
00:28:21,369 --> 00:28:32,890
about? Replay this game. Collection get. Save current game. Yes. Put it in slot one.

166
00:28:33,529 --> 00:29:11,690
Which bank will you save game data in? Toothbrush lizard? All right. Sounds good. What? Wouldn't

167
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:24,390
you be more injured? I feel like first try I could do a better job dubbing that. I mean,

168
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:27,190
maybe not like the quality of the voice, but like the quality of the singing.

169
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:56,490
My dog can talk. That's a real quick way to get everyone to pay attention.

170
00:30:00,069 --> 00:30:03,349
No, but then it's like every television show that's ever had a talking animal in it.

171
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:10,599
They'll come over and the dog won't talk. It'll just like pee on a hydrant or something. It won't

172
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:25,609
speak. What the fuck is this? Remember the Warner Brothers frog? The guy that found the frog.

173
00:30:25,609 --> 00:30:29,529
They're hello my baby. Hello my dog. And nobody did. He didn't do it in front of anybody else.

174
00:30:29,529 --> 00:30:44,329
And the guy went nuts as a boomer reference. That's a classic piece of animation history.

175
00:30:47,900 --> 00:31:02,700
Flying. Oh, you're stopping the UFO invasion. This sounds pretty good. I got to get both

176
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:44,039
headphones into this one. Nice. Pretty good. 100% this one. What do you say?

177
00:31:55,130 --> 00:32:08,759
That was hard. It was hard. That was hard. What do you mean killing? I'm not killing anybody.

178
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:47,529
I'm still winning. Slot machine. I love it. Damn it. This controller sucks. What brand is this?

179
00:32:47,529 --> 00:32:51,210
It's unbranded. That's the problem. I have an unbranded controller right now.

180
00:32:51,930 --> 00:33:08,220
That's bad. It's not even a mad cat. I'm still winning. All right. You're going to pay attention.

181
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:44,119
Fuck. Come on. I was doing it. I haven't taken very much damage. That's all right. Okay. Be ready.

182
00:33:44,920 --> 00:34:06,650
Oh, come on. This thing's unbranded. It's unbranded. It has a turbo, though.

183
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:17,059
Watch out, little lady.

184
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:56,300
I fucked up. Not the last note.

185
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:11,079
That's the last note again. You absolutely fucked the ending.

186
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,000
You win.

187
00:35:16,409 --> 00:35:33,500
I still did okay. Me. I'll take it. Why do I not have an official PS2 controller? What was I

188
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:43,179
thinking? I mean, yes. This is a purchase from like three years ago. Go get one. I don't need one.

189
00:35:43,179 --> 00:36:01,539
I'll deal with it. It's an excuse. Can you imagine? Okay. So I don't want to leave right now. Like,

190
00:36:01,539 --> 00:36:08,820
no, I can't. I don't want to leave. I just started the stream. Imagine like Uber Eatsing,

191
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:18,340
a PlayStation 2 controller, like Postmatesing, an Uber Eats controller. You can't buy these guys.

192
00:36:19,139 --> 00:36:25,260
There's no buying these. A PlayStation 2 controller, you can't buy them anywhere. You

193
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:37,829
have to like special get them on like Amazon. Do Amazon same day prime. Yeah. It'll be here in

194
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:56,650
like 12 hours. Same day delivery. Yeah, it's three o'clock Pacific. Okay, let's go. Get out,

195
00:36:56,650 --> 00:37:09,639
get out, get out, get out, get out. No, don't. I already did it, didn't I? Yes. No.

196
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,260
Get Amazon ultra delivery.

197
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:32,860
Do not fail me. Send Moto King B into the forest.

198
00:37:36,949 --> 00:37:41,909
Okay, listen, you one, you're of the guitar man bloodline, inheritor of the legendary guitar.

199
00:37:41,909 --> 00:37:45,750
Of course. If you can collect all the guitars, you'll gain great powers and boom,

200
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:50,469
huh? I have other plans. I'm going to practice my skateboarding and Pico's going to be like,

201
00:37:50,469 --> 00:37:58,869
wow, you're so cool. Look, only you can use this guitar that's been passed down for generations

202
00:37:58,869 --> 00:38:04,150
by the ancestors. The ancestors, meaning my ancestors, meaning what? By the way, Puma,

203
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:08,150
since when exactly have you been living at my place? I don't know exactly when I was born,

204
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:14,789
so I'm not exactly the, look out. Are you sure that that dog's okay? It's got like a crushed head.

205
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:49,559
All right, here we go. I didn't even see the intro here. Frog King B.

206
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:32,389
Let's do it. All right. That was definitely the best song so far.

207
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:15,239
Yeah, that's all the commentary you're going to get. That's the only thing I'm going to say

208
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:26,199
this whole stream. I guarantee it. Yeah. Yeah. Just cap that and just play it over and over again.

209
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:56,440
I'm not doing that bad this one. I'm not. Yeah. Oh, sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

210
00:41:27,929 --> 00:41:33,079
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I was trying to think of what to say.

211
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:34,920
I had to get, I got to come up with my bread and butter.

212
00:41:35,639 --> 00:42:15,699
Holy shit. I have the whole thing screwed up. Okay. Did I win? It's pretty, it's pretty close.

213
00:42:15,699 --> 00:43:38,900
Come on. Get rid of them. Yes. Here comes the finale. Oh my God. Kim Post makes me a

214
00:43:38,900 --> 00:44:02,150
PlayStation 2 controller. What? What do you mean try again? No. What? I can't press start? Hold on.

215
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:13,780
If I pause the game, that's, that's immediate retry. Oh, and what? Oh, that's not good.

216
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:24,710
There's no breaks. You actually can't. I guess I understand because it's cheating.

217
00:44:24,710 --> 00:45:02,650
There was like 30 seconds left in this song. Hold on a second. Here we go. It's the PS2 version of

218
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:13,500
this game, not the controller. The controls are poopy. What's wrong? Why do I have to have help?

219
00:45:14,389 --> 00:45:22,059
All right. I'm going to, this is the one. Here we go. Can you pause real quick? I need to pee.

220
00:45:22,059 --> 00:45:31,190
No, we're going to turn it up. That's what we're going to do. You got pee? Oh, that's too bad.

221
00:45:32,809 --> 00:45:36,250
And you know what? I'm fine. This is, I, I like the song. The song is good. Here we go.

222
00:45:37,210 --> 00:46:10,340
It's all right. Fucked up is going on here. Did this shit get harder because I retried it?

223
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:45,510
Never been as hard. Going from down to up or left to right is like,

224
00:46:47,829 --> 00:47:03,900
shit didn't happen the last time I did this. Look, look, I'm not doing anything.

225
00:47:04,699 --> 00:47:29,900
I'm not doing, I wasn't doing anything. I was holding it in the same spot. That's just DDR.

226
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:45,960
I never even played DDR in my entire life. I've never played DDR. I'm serious. Not one time.

227
00:47:46,679 --> 00:48:16,760
DDR was the only exercise I ever got. No, that's what I had Wii Sports for.

228
00:48:38,139 --> 00:49:14,389
Banging on the door? Getting close. All right. Finale. This is it. Pause games. I'm not pausing.

229
00:49:14,389 --> 00:49:45,590
I can't. Come on. It's too, you don't get it. Look at the change. Look at the change. You saw it.

230
00:49:45,590 --> 00:50:10,250
Let's see. I didn't fuck that up. All right. So if I look, look, see what happened. So I'm moving

231
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:16,329
from like, I'm moving one degree. Sometimes you move one degree and it goes to like four o'clock.

232
00:50:17,289 --> 00:50:25,210
If you start at 12 and you want to move it to one, it will go to like four o'clock sometimes.

233
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:51,429
I'm telling you. Hold on a second. It's not possible. You can't, you can't,

234
00:50:52,070 --> 00:51:08,969
I can't get a PS2 controller right now. I've exercised those options. Okay. Looks good.

235
00:51:21,289 --> 00:51:26,650
It's Miranda the elder. Quite impressive. Defeating such a powerful gravillian agent.

236
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:30,969
Gravillian? Oh, we've prayed and waited for this moment.

237
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:45,690
It's one of Stewie's grand, like, steam costumes.

238
00:51:46,010 --> 00:52:07,340
He just wants to learn how to skateboard.

239
00:52:08,059 --> 00:52:16,969
Everything in life is the consequence of your own acts. Master the waves.

240
00:52:24,199 --> 00:52:29,610
All right. Here we are. Two moons.

241
00:52:29,610 --> 00:53:00,920
It's a hammerhead shark that plays music.

242
00:53:03,769 --> 00:53:22,619
Here we go. It's a weird beat. It's a little bit of a weird beat.

243
00:53:23,179 --> 00:53:41,989
It's hard to keep up with because it's off beats. Not that hard. It was. I'm not going to diminish

244
00:53:41,989 --> 00:54:08,309
the fact that it was very hard. Oh shit. Oh, I gotta pause the game. I gotta pause it.

245
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:53,530
Oh my God. When can I fight him? Can I do damage? Is that just phase one? That's probably phase one.

246
00:54:54,090 --> 00:55:01,269
You made it. No, that's it. I did it. All right. That was pretty tricky.

247
00:55:01,989 --> 00:55:14,869
The issue was the do-do-do. So it goes do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

248
00:55:14,869 --> 00:55:36,059
And you have to press the do-do-do. It can get tricky. Overwrite it. Save it.

249
00:55:41,139 --> 00:56:03,559
Okay. Is this first playthrough? Yes. I have never played this game before.

250
00:56:03,559 --> 00:56:07,079
Oh, would you look at that? Now he's a giant robot. What do we do, robot?

251
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:19,449
He transformed it into a deep turntable? All right. That's pretty crazy. That's pretty crazy.

252
00:56:19,449 --> 00:56:47,300
The music for this level sucks. Does it? No. It's a good start.

253
00:56:53,110 --> 00:57:14,920
Damn. I love it. All right. Let's do it. Mech battle. Follow me.

254
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:37,719
These fucking controls, man. Give me a break. Like, look at that. How am I...

255
00:57:45,989 --> 00:58:21,690
No, there's no way. What the fuck did I do wrong here? No, no, no. Look at... It's not...

256
00:58:21,690 --> 00:58:32,039
Do you see what happens here? No way. Uh-uh. It's not me. Look. It's not me. Look what happens.

257
00:58:32,039 --> 00:59:29,500
Look at this. Oh, why? No, stop. I have to tilt my neck. My god. I don't know if I'm going to be

258
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:49,739
able to do this. Oh, my god, guys. I can't postmate the controller. Kim already looked.

259
00:59:50,780 --> 01:00:14,309
Sorry. I can still win. Don't push the stick. So, when you see it spaz out, that is probably

260
01:00:14,309 --> 01:00:34,340
one degree change. I can still win.

261
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,920
That might become a real problem later on, though.

262
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:13,460
What the fuck? I'm not touching anything. I've heard better reggae. Well, it doesn't help that

263
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:38,329
half of the song is not being played. I'm still going to win. I mean, my defense is just absolutely

264
01:01:38,329 --> 01:01:44,889
impenetrable.

265
01:01:59,769 --> 01:02:04,380
No! No!

266
01:02:15,579 --> 01:02:17,420
I almost paused the game for that one.

267
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:34,090
I actually did it. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. No!

268
01:02:57,699 --> 01:03:08,730
Anytime there's a change of direction is where it becomes, like, impossible.

269
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:22,500
Finale incoming.

270
01:03:30,539 --> 01:03:37,179
Okay. No, that's it. That was the finale. Use the d-pad? I don't think you can.

271
01:03:39,449 --> 01:03:43,050
This one's probably going to be a C. I can't guarantee a B for this one. Yes, I can.

272
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:53,980
Save, please. Save, please. What am I doing wrong?

273
01:03:58,019 --> 01:04:08,280
Save. Previously saved game data exists. Overwrite saved data. Yes. Hold on a second.

274
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:22,650
Wouldn't the highlighted one be the one that's... Okay.

275
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:28,340
Huh? What's that? We got it.

276
01:04:56,650 --> 01:04:59,610
It's just Rick and Morty voice acting.

277
01:05:11,369 --> 01:05:14,969
Yeah, that's the demeanor that Justin Roiland does for every character that's

278
01:05:14,969 --> 01:05:17,210
a character that you're not supposed to care about.

279
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:23,829
Hey, it's me, this character. The one that talks like this. I'm doing this. I'm in the bathtub.

280
01:05:23,909 --> 01:05:25,989
It's me. Bathtub. I'm the bathtub guy.

281
01:05:44,179 --> 01:05:47,219
I didn't know. Okay. I thought I had Jaundice.

282
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:52,780
Like I said, there's a whole... All right. I'm not going to talk over Cousin.

283
01:06:07,059 --> 01:06:10,500
I just came out for a walk to see the moon, but then I heard that.

284
01:06:11,139 --> 01:06:14,579
Oh, this. Yeah. Somehow I seem to be okay with this thing.

285
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:18,659
You're good. I tried once, but I could never play like that.

286
01:06:27,829 --> 01:06:39,610
Is there a reason why every like anime young boy character is an old lady straining their voice?

287
01:06:40,820 --> 01:06:56,199
That's... Isn't that strange? It's weird, right? Wait, this is like a... Hold on.

288
01:06:57,079 --> 01:07:09,110
I wrote this song for you. No, hold on. I've been practicing.

289
01:07:13,449 --> 01:07:28,139
Don't get up. Don't get up. Hold on. Oh, no. Sorry. I have to go home now.

290
01:07:40,730 --> 01:07:43,530
That's fucking funny. All right. Let's do it for real.

291
01:07:43,530 --> 01:07:56,250
I wrote this kid's day. Let's see what happens after a few weeks of practice.

292
01:07:56,250 --> 01:08:02,219
Actually, probably like more like eight years of practice. 10,000 hours of practice.

293
01:08:10,019 --> 01:08:20,119
He's going to play Wonderwall. No, he's not.

294
01:08:35,659 --> 01:08:42,229
She looks over like, okay, come on. Come on. You fucked that one up.

295
01:08:45,369 --> 01:08:56,489
Why does she have a life bar? Why am I like killing her? I guess

296
01:08:57,210 --> 01:09:04,310
I kind of would be like in this situation, right? I just gotta listen to this.

297
01:09:17,260 --> 01:09:57,899
All right. He's got half the notes. Okay. Nice job. That's the abrupt changes. I'm trying.

298
01:10:13,079 --> 01:10:29,720
Don't make me laugh. Don't make me laugh, please. It's almost over. I did it. Oh, yeah.

299
01:10:38,010 --> 01:10:58,520
I got another V. That's too generous. No, it's not. It's fine. Just in case everyone's curious,

300
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:04,199
I have to press the down button on the D-pad. That's not left. It's not right. It's down on the

301
01:11:04,199 --> 01:11:13,930
D-pad. I'm sorry. And it was fucking completely silent too. The singer's voice was honey love.

302
01:11:13,930 --> 01:11:30,550
What? Where's Puma? Puma. Puma. Where'd you go? Why'd you leave me? What am I going to do about

303
01:11:30,630 --> 01:11:46,039
myself? No, not again. That's expensive. I have you now, Gitaru man. Puma, what's happened? Where

304
01:11:46,039 --> 01:11:50,119
could you have gone? I want those shoes. So lonely, Puma. Those things are awesome. We've been together

305
01:11:50,119 --> 01:11:58,359
so long. That's why I said I didn't want to come to this stupid place. What? It's moving.

306
01:12:02,439 --> 01:12:06,119
I probably can get those at a mall kiosk. You know, like the big goofy

307
01:12:06,199 --> 01:12:14,680
sneaker slippers. Welcome to our planet, Gitaru man. Hey, it's you. How does it feel to know

308
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:21,560
you've been had? Zoe, I'm going to. By the way, your friend has been waiting for you.

309
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:29,699
Don't say it. I know what they look like. So you dognapped him. It was too easy. You're both

310
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:36,979
so cute. Gitaru man, without this mutt, you can't fight. You creep, give Puma back to me. Go son

311
01:12:36,979 --> 01:12:43,979
Montreal. This is going to be fun. All right. Is this, how's this one? Anybody know the songs?

312
01:12:43,979 --> 01:12:53,430
Is this one good? All of a sudden it's like, I'd be like, holy shit. It's, it's the bone song.

313
01:12:53,989 --> 01:13:32,180
Holy shit. Bone song. I don't have a guitar. Let's go. This is the best song.

314
01:13:32,739 --> 01:14:23,029
Come on, you're the guitar. Get it. Here we go.

315
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:49,189
I didn't even see this mobile combat theme. Oh shit. Oh my God.

316
01:16:30,789 --> 01:16:37,960
Thank God somebody has a trumpet behind me.

317
01:17:01,619 --> 01:17:04,949
Holy shit. Hard game boss.

318
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:13,539
From here to here is an issue.

319
01:17:18,949 --> 01:17:20,390
And then from here to here is an issue.

320
01:17:20,789 --> 01:17:23,399
God damn it. You win.

321
01:17:30,420 --> 01:18:07,159
B. Not a C. Come on. Let's go. I'm going to get it. I have to get a B. Come on. It's all about

322
01:18:07,159 --> 01:19:33,670
defense. That was just doing it on. Why's it not telling me how I did? Gitaru! What the fuck is

323
01:19:33,670 --> 01:19:47,899
going on right now? What? Was that just, that was, that's a replay. Like a replay of the,

324
01:19:47,899 --> 01:20:07,750
like it records the game. What? Replay this game? Like replay the left, like redo it, like do it.

325
01:20:07,750 --> 01:20:14,069
This is like 2000, this is like 1999 or something. It records your game for you.

326
01:20:20,470 --> 01:20:27,100
That would be retry. I don't know. It's a Japanese game, isn't it? Like replay this game.

327
01:20:27,739 --> 01:20:42,180
I don't know. I thought it was like redo it, like do it again. I don't know that the game

328
01:20:42,180 --> 01:21:11,060
records everything you do. And by the way, manga S. Damn it. What the fuck? I just want to retry

329
01:21:11,060 --> 01:21:20,250
the level. Replay this level. You're all so grateful. Grateful to me? Gosh, we have been

330
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:25,369
freed. But the real battle is just beginning. To save this planet, you must get back all

331
01:21:25,369 --> 01:21:30,569
the Gitarus the enemy has taken. There are just two left. When they're all collected,

332
01:21:30,569 --> 01:21:35,289
a great power will shake the sky. You can't allow Zoe to possess that power.

333
01:21:36,810 --> 01:21:45,270
Gitaruman, go now! Let's do it. We gotta go, you one. We gotta get out of here.

334
01:21:45,270 --> 01:22:01,140
Don't lose now. Okay, here we go. Just two more. That's it? I'm about to beat this fucking game.

335
01:22:09,590 --> 01:22:24,789
Gregorio. That's either the third or that is a scroll. Like a magic scroll. Or it's a

336
01:22:25,750 --> 01:22:29,750
like a sand time thing that you turn upside down. This just sounds pretty good.

337
01:22:53,510 --> 01:23:17,380
Replay it. But these last two might be very hard. Maybe can I turn like sensitivity down? Definitely

338
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:34,340
not. It's so small. It's such a tiny increase. It's stuck. There's no fucking

339
01:23:34,340 --> 01:24:26,579
way you can do this. Possible, I don't think. I'm trying so hard right now. Got it.

340
01:24:37,289 --> 01:25:07,449
Winning. Here comes the defense. What did you do that? Sorry, I had to do that.

341
01:25:45,529 --> 01:25:52,279
Why did somebody just say omega lol? For what reason? For what reason did you say that?

342
01:26:18,460 --> 01:26:51,899
Oh, I'm gonna win. Oh my god, it's so hard. I'm doing it wrong. I don't know what I'm

343
01:26:51,899 --> 01:27:17,989
doing wrong. It's okay. Come on. Come on. Kill him. Please. I don't want to do it again. Oh no.

344
01:27:28,069 --> 01:27:40,939
No! What? You lose. Mama, I've done it again. It's so hard to control. It's so hard.

345
01:27:42,060 --> 01:27:50,649
This is the analog. Please. I'm telling you. Don't think I'm bad. It's not me. It's not me.

346
01:27:52,409 --> 01:27:58,069
Don't think that I'm not good. It's not me. This isn't me. It's not me.

347
01:28:05,420 --> 01:28:07,829
All right. Focus.

348
01:28:21,109 --> 01:28:55,909
It was the controller. All right. Come on. I didn't do anything.

349
01:29:06,739 --> 01:29:26,699
All right. Let's go. It just ripped to the side. Come on. Good.

350
01:29:36,550 --> 01:29:40,439
All right. Get ready. I fucked it up last time. Bad. Not this time.

351
01:29:47,479 --> 01:29:49,560
What happened there? What was the problem?

352
01:29:50,039 --> 01:30:49,939
I don't get it. Fuck out of here. All right. This is where it gets hard.

353
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:34,470
All right. He's dead. Come on. I know I can do it.

354
01:31:54,420 --> 01:32:15,210
Mama, I've done it again. That was a lot of screaming.

355
01:32:15,529 --> 01:32:25,579
I was like a bat just came in my room and flew in and went right in my face like a pigeon got in here.

356
01:32:26,859 --> 01:32:57,289
It's like da-da, da-da, da-da. But I said, God damn it, I have to emulate. Somebody told me the emulator

357
01:32:57,289 --> 01:33:01,529
doesn't have this problem. Well, this is the original. We have to deal with how much it sucks.

358
01:33:25,239 --> 01:33:28,199
I'm going to beat him this time. All right. I'm ready. Here we go. Here we go.

359
01:33:29,319 --> 01:33:36,119
I'm not. Here we go. This is it. Here we go. I'm not doing it this time. I've done it twice already.

360
01:33:36,119 --> 01:35:08,420
Imagine I did it. Pretend I did it. Here we go. Fuck. Don't fuck it up. Don't fuck it up.

361
01:35:08,420 --> 01:35:12,460
It's hard, but don't screw it up. I got to have both hands with control here.

362
01:35:50,060 --> 01:35:51,989
Here it is.

363
01:35:52,550 --> 01:36:35,909
Da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da. Please. The finale. Don't screw it up.

364
01:36:45,689 --> 01:37:19,210
I did it. I win. My goodness. You win. And that's not even the last one. There's one more after this.

365
01:37:25,319 --> 01:37:37,350
I missed a lot. It's okay. The final boss is even worse. Shit. No, I don't want to replay this game.

366
01:37:37,590 --> 01:37:52,140
Oh, man. We're going to be here for a while.

367
01:37:52,220 --> 01:38:00,699
I'm impressed. It seems the legends are true, but I've prepared the stage for the ultimate test.

368
01:38:00,699 --> 01:38:06,939
Who's the true ruler of planet Gitaru? It will be decided once and for all here in Gitaru Arena.

369
01:38:06,939 --> 01:38:17,020
No, it ain't just you wait. You're finished. You're the one who's finished,

370
01:38:17,020 --> 01:38:23,340
Gitaru man. This time you will relinquish your Gitaru to me. Greatest Gravillian warrior, enter.

371
01:38:23,340 --> 01:38:34,439
Wait, what? What? What the fuck? What? Lost your nerve? This girl has been

372
01:38:34,439 --> 01:38:42,600
bred since birth to be our mightiest warrior. No. But I played the guitar.

373
01:38:44,439 --> 01:38:49,800
Oh, it's you. You're the Gitaru man. Well, when I listen to you at the tree,

374
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:58,260
this is going to be real easy. No, I can't do it. Puma. She's the one person that I refuse to fight.

375
01:38:58,899 --> 01:39:18,819
All right. I'm going to get this on first try. Controller sucks. The mechanics suck. The game

376
01:39:18,819 --> 01:39:26,340
sucks. No. I mean, some of that's true, but no, we're not going to say that right now. We're going

377
01:39:26,340 --> 01:40:47,529
to do it. All right. Good. We're doing country versus rock. I don't know which one. Hey, hey.

378
01:40:48,329 --> 01:41:03,319
If I block it, I can't block it. What's he doing to me? Control split. What the? No. Come on.

379
01:41:04,840 --> 01:41:06,600
Oh, I refuse to fight. Right.

380
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:30,140
No, get up.

381
01:41:30,140 --> 01:41:43,850
No. That thing's not even a guitar. What is that thing?

382
01:41:51,939 --> 01:42:11,300
Oh, getting called out. Wait, that's the song that I played at the tree.

383
01:42:11,300 --> 01:42:21,939
And I sing now. Yeah. Nevermind. I'm just going to play.

384
01:43:01,260 --> 01:43:21,159
My finger's falling off the fucking analog. We're playing it together.

385
01:43:50,340 --> 01:44:13,319
It's my fingers up. My finger. What the fuck are you doing?

386
01:44:13,319 --> 01:44:43,029
The people watching in the stands. This is kind of embarrassing. Oh, boy. I really,

387
01:44:43,029 --> 01:44:46,310
really shouldn't have drank like that full pint of vodka before playing.

388
01:44:46,869 --> 01:45:22,100
It was a mistake. It's a big deal for me right now. Did anybody notice? I got them all. You know

389
01:45:22,100 --> 01:45:37,420
what happens now? You are the true guitar man. You are the true guitar man. What about the bad guy?

390
01:45:37,420 --> 01:45:58,220
All right. Back to B. Good. B tier.

391
01:46:27,100 --> 01:46:32,220
Incredible powers. Powers like what? Awesome powers that only the almighty,

392
01:46:32,220 --> 01:46:37,420
well, anyway, it's the best guitar whoever. Well done, you won. The same clothes, too.

393
01:46:37,420 --> 01:46:44,060
This last guitar was truly meant for you. The clothes? These small? We got them all, you won.

394
01:46:44,060 --> 01:46:52,149
Nobody really did it. I didn't? Me? Maybe I'm not so pathetic after all. Here comes the not so fast.

395
01:46:52,149 --> 01:46:57,420
Pathetic? No, you're not. There is nothing to fear, but here it's so.

396
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:07,479
Akira, you betrayed me. No, Zoe. I just finally realized that my music is not for fighting.

397
01:47:07,479 --> 01:47:14,920
That's right. Go, Zoe. I hate you. Curse you, guitar man. I'll fight you myself.

398
01:47:14,920 --> 01:47:21,079
My arm and guitar will blast you to smithereens. Eat this. No. You can do what you want. You can,

399
01:47:21,079 --> 01:47:28,039
indeed. Silence. Silence yourself, Zoe. Go home. Go home? No, I won't go home. I'm going to rule

400
01:47:28,039 --> 01:47:32,119
the universe with the last guitar. There's no future in your dreams, Zoe. All your goons are

401
01:47:32,119 --> 01:47:37,319
gone. It's just you. What did you say, punk? You think I can't beat you by myself? You're just a

402
01:47:37,319 --> 01:47:46,439
pathetic loser. You couldn't beat me in all of Neverending Eternity. Why you? Can't you do it?

403
01:47:46,439 --> 01:47:51,079
So tell me, what do you do? I can do it. What, defeat me? I can't. No, not you. Can't you?

404
01:47:51,079 --> 01:47:55,960
You're a loser. Am not. Always made fun of. No way. Always stuck. Never. Always running. No.

405
01:47:55,960 --> 01:48:01,000
Always failing. No. Failing all things. No. Can't do anything. Yes, I can. This is the Venom movie.

406
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:05,720
I can do it. What can you do? I can do it. What? What can you do? Show me now. Sure, I can.

407
01:48:05,720 --> 01:48:11,000
You miserable scrub. Show me all you've got. I can do it. I can. No, you can't. I can. There's no

408
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:16,279
way you can. You can't. You can't. Because I can. Because what? Because. Say it. Because what? I

409
01:48:16,279 --> 01:48:26,069
can do it. Because. Because. Because I'm guitarist. Oh, the true power. The light. The light.

410
01:48:29,859 --> 01:48:42,649
Did my voice change? This is going to be fun. What's the song though? That's important. What's

411
01:48:42,649 --> 01:48:58,539
like the final battle song? It's actually Wonderwall. That joke was made a long time ago.

412
01:48:59,260 --> 01:49:18,140
It's a... Today is going to be a day. Okay. I can't do that. I have to restart it.

413
01:49:18,699 --> 01:50:46,579
Fuck. Why? What? What? Come on, quick. I skipped over the radio station a few times.

414
01:50:46,579 --> 01:52:12,920
The bad reception. Yeah. I'm going to win. All right. This is where I'm going to do the damage.

415
01:53:00,789 --> 01:53:32,569
All right. Come on. Look at his health. Like a full health. He ain't got nothing.

416
01:53:57,750 --> 01:54:04,760
Nobody's just at the volume control. Putting it from 10 to zero over and over again.

417
01:54:36,380 --> 01:54:41,260
I think I won. I lost here for a second. The legendary guitarist.

418
01:54:41,260 --> 01:54:51,369
I was choking. I was choking there really hard at the end. But I did it. That's okay. Damn.

419
01:54:55,560 --> 01:55:05,779
That was a lot. 32%. Great. 36% good. This is going to be an A.

420
01:55:06,420 --> 01:55:16,420
Okay. What? Oh, because B is purple. Okay. I get it. It's all right. Whatever.

421
01:55:25,739 --> 01:56:06,899
That song was wild. That was a good one. I did it. Hooray. It doesn't take much to turn impossible

422
01:56:07,539 --> 01:56:15,979
into I'm possible. What? I've taken the leap. It's your turn. This is a bad ending.

423
01:56:25,350 --> 01:56:29,350
Hey, you won. Why don't you give it up? You're starting to get on my nerves.

424
01:56:36,470 --> 01:56:44,710
Here we go. Epilogue song. Come on. Epilogue song. Come on.

425
01:57:01,930 --> 01:57:03,770
Do you know my name?

426
01:57:06,010 --> 01:57:07,770
What does that mean?

427
01:57:16,409 --> 01:57:23,159
You hard bone. I mean, I know there's more.

428
01:57:34,789 --> 01:57:38,229
Do you play the game?

429
01:58:12,180 --> 01:58:17,720
You can't hear me. Somebody said the game's only three hours. Perfect for someone with chronic

430
01:58:17,720 --> 01:58:37,479
intestinal problems. You're right. What the fuck are you talking about? All right. Skip. Skip it.

431
01:59:07,289 --> 01:59:23,659
The game is in. It's not open. And it was great. It's not open. The game must have even refunded

432
01:59:23,659 --> 01:59:27,819
on steam. This is a collector's item. Why would I refund the collector's item?

433
01:59:33,579 --> 01:59:57,739
PS2 steam game. Master's play. Oh no. Theater? What's theater? Oh, it's just the cut scenes.

434
02:00:01,939 --> 02:00:14,060
Master's play. I just want to... There's more. Oh man. What is this? I don't know what that

435
02:00:14,060 --> 02:00:29,289
would even mean. This is too much. I can't do this. I don't understand. This is Master's...

436
02:00:30,170 --> 02:00:45,989
This is hard mode. What does it add? Just more timings? More beats and everything? What do you

437
02:00:45,989 --> 02:02:32,699
think it does? It starts you at like no health. Spinning. Spinning. Spinning. No, it's not. I'm

438
02:02:32,699 --> 02:04:00,279
doing fine. This guy. Is this guy the original? Come on. Come on. That was so close.

439
02:04:28,149 --> 02:05:08,539
Got it. That was easy. No, not really. You win. This would be fun to play high as fuck.

440
02:05:11,350 --> 02:05:24,039
I mean, or not. It could just be... It doesn't matter. It could be normal. We're going to hit

441
02:05:24,039 --> 02:05:39,369
a wall. Probably the next song, I would say. I'm going to watch the cut scene.

442
02:05:41,289 --> 02:06:00,569
All right. This one's going to be tricky. Don't skip lore. We already saw it.

443
02:06:01,449 --> 02:06:07,750
I'm one of these I'm going to do sincerely tired Leon. It's going to be an embarrassment.

444
02:06:08,390 --> 02:06:27,909
See if I can do it. I feel like I've improved a bit.

445
02:06:28,550 --> 02:07:40,180
I'm not. No, I'm not. I did it. I did it. Fine. It fell down.

446
02:08:23,380 --> 02:08:35,989
The PlayStation 2 is hooked up. I have a couple of secret PlayStation 2 games back here. Secret

447
02:08:35,989 --> 02:08:54,220
ones that I have never played on this stream. Or I put in Um Jam and Lammy and we continue the

448
02:08:54,220 --> 02:09:05,880
rhythm games. Probably Um Jam and Lammy requires... I have to switch out the PS2 and the PS1.

449
02:09:13,289 --> 02:09:21,289
I actually do need to take a small break for reasons. I'm going to leave it up to you.

450
02:09:22,170 --> 02:09:32,010
We'll do another couple hours. So let's do that. Let's be right back. I'll put a poll in here.

451
02:09:32,970 --> 02:09:39,510
Either secret PlayStation 2 games, or game, or Um Jam and Lammy. That requires me to switch out

452
02:09:39,510 --> 02:09:49,300
the PS1. Guitar Man is actually pretty fun. I might actually try to do like one or two more

453
02:09:49,300 --> 02:09:57,779
levels in Guitar Man. It's fun. It's hard to control, but it's fun. Okay. Which one? Um Jammer,

454
02:09:59,850 --> 02:10:07,750
Lammy, or secret PS2 game. Guess what? I don't even know what it is.

455
02:10:08,550 --> 02:10:16,569
It could be anything because I don't even fucking know. All right. I'll be right back. I'm going to

456
02:10:16,569 --> 02:10:28,439
be a couple minutes. So go grab a snack if you want to. I'll be right back. The PS2 is backwards

457
02:10:28,439 --> 02:10:32,600
compatible. Are you fucking kidding me? Why would I do that? I almost just unhooked everything.

458
02:10:36,090 --> 02:10:41,750
I forgot. Wow. Okay. All right. I'll be right back though anyways.
