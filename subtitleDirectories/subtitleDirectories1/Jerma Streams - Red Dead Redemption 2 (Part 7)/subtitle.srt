1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:07,000
So let's see if they can get it situated at least somewhat playable in like an hour or two.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,460
Let's go. I get it. Uh, well, I don't even need... I don't have to change the title.

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:27,480
That title is fine. So you lied to us yesterday. Wait, what did I say yesterday? What did I say

4
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:41,159
yesterday? You said jackbox. Yeah, but do you want just a random jackbox stream for like two

5
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:46,140
hours? Do you want like a five to seven hour jackbox stream on Friday? You know what I mean?

6
00:00:52,490 --> 00:01:07,879
Do it both. Well, no, we're doing it on Friday. He's a liar. Right. He's like, well, wait, hold on.

7
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:14,200
Didn't I say yesterday that depending on how long we were in Red Dead 2, that we would do jackbox

8
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,519
maybe depending on if it was, if I only was in it for like an hour or two, right?

9
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:26,069
Didn't I say something like that along those lines? Yes. Yes. Yes, I did. Yeah. Yeah. Yes,

10
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:40,379
I did. Yeah. Yes. See, it's just like online. See? Yeah, let's give them some time to try

11
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:54,540
it again because I still haven't done all this. Where we going here? Jackbox, jackbox.

12
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:05,379
Friday will be fun. So I need to go here. So we need to take a stage coach from here

13
00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:15,979
all the way across the world to here and then ride home roads. Oh, why can't today be fun?

14
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:28,180
Well, because we attempted to play a beta that wasn't ready. Am I going to make rules

15
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:38,310
for people joining the game this time? You mean jackbox? Let me actually, I might be able to

16
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:42,870
set something up where it just picks people randomly. Isn't that like an extension for you

17
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:49,270
that you can get that and then like that, that person, that person gets picked again.

18
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:57,349
I could do it like that. That'd be fun. Why do I hate Red Dead single player so much? Oh,

19
00:02:57,349 --> 00:03:02,229
no, I don't. I love this game. I think this game is awesome. It's just, I mean, the

20
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:07,349
multiplayer is just the new thing and it's really, really interesting. Like, oh wow,

21
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:15,979
it's Rockstar's new online in the wild west. Cool. I think my horse's foot just explode.

22
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:32,699
I hate jackbox. Play Fistful of Frags. I don't even have it installed. Remember,

23
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:35,979
I reinstalled Windows. Remember the Windows update bullshit I was going through

24
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:41,180
where we just would not turn it. Where is this marker? Oh, right. Stagecoach.

25
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:54,969
Yeah, I had to reinstall Windows completely. So I lost all my downloads. I tried to get as

26
00:03:54,969 --> 00:04:01,979
many things as I wanted before. Peggle 2 got me excited.

27
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:23,589
Full of, I'm full of letdowns, guys. I'm sorry. It's only like two gigs. Letdown stream.

28
00:04:23,589 --> 00:04:37,459
No. Damn I though. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I gotta get up before anybody witnesses it.

29
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:48,139
Quick, get me to Rhodes Ranch before somebody witnesses me. Uh, Coachman. Hello. Hello.

30
00:04:49,300 --> 00:05:04,220
I'd like to take a ride. Take a ride, please. Take a ride. Coachman. L2. What the fuck?

31
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:22,550
Am I sure I'm not online? Who is shooting? Is it the guy? Is it the guy that I bumped into?

32
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:41,420
It's not a bounty. It's what? Wait, did I what? What did I just do? I just like broke into his lock.

33
00:05:45,579 --> 00:06:02,220
Break. Oh, God. Did I break his wagon? This guy's gonna dump this thing off the end.

34
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:08,970
Where's my horse? Oh, for the love of God, this is gonna be bad up ahead.

35
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:34,329
Stop shooting. You have so many opportunities. Fuck off. No, now you decided to come. Now

36
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:46,339
you decided to come over here, horse, huh? It was the guy. It was the guy I bumped into.

37
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:57,800
You just couldn't let it go. Now you let it go permanently. All right. Back to the stage,

38
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:19,180
Coach. Before this guy sees me over here. Wait. What was that? Somebody in the water?

39
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:42,389
I don't see him. There's a random stranger over here somewhere. Oh, there he is.

40
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:52,949
All right. What's what? What do you need help with, sir? Mad preacher.

41
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:19,459
What?

42
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,300
Am I the signal?

43
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:37,350
No.

44
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:56,220
Okay. Well, that was it. He's going back up here. Is there something I can do with this guy?

45
00:08:57,019 --> 00:08:59,659
Besides just push him off the cliff into the water, which is what

46
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:37,500
I'm sure everybody wants me to do. Where is he? Look out, mister.

47
00:09:41,529 --> 00:10:14,889
That didn't hurt him. Okay. Got it. This is all I need.

48
00:10:15,909 --> 00:10:28,840
Okay. Now why is this happening? All right. Come with me. First circle the talk while running.

49
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:50,470
No, whoops. No. All right. I need to pick him up. No, I'm not going to do anything to him.

50
00:10:50,470 --> 00:11:01,940
I just wanted to see what he would do if I jumped on him. I'm putting him back in bed.

51
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:11,080
I might've hurt him a little bit, but he's back in bed. He's going to be fine. All right.

52
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:18,299
Have a nice day. He just witnessed an assault. Well, he's the guy that I

53
00:11:18,299 --> 00:11:27,340
asked. Oh, now we're doing it all over again. How do I like to?

54
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:36,759
Nothing. Relax.

55
00:11:46,840 --> 00:12:24,440
Just stop. Stop. Hey, stop it. Stop. What's the objective here? There really is none.

56
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:39,220
Goodbye. Have fun. Enjoy the rest of your life. That's not how you make friends. That's how I

57
00:12:39,220 --> 00:13:14,490
make friends with GTA Online and Rockstar Online. Enjoy the bounty. All right. We're good.

58
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:27,960
So I need to go. It was the fucking stagecoach because the guy, look, it all started. This

59
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:32,679
15 to 20 straight minute nonsense started because I bumped. I ran into a guy in town

60
00:13:33,799 --> 00:14:04,309
and it just spiraled out of control. Five dollar bounty. I can pay that. What's this?

61
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:15,289
Why is there a red circle in there? So the sheriff's office. Just pay the bounty. Take the

62
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:24,980
stagecoach. Everybody hates me here. Let's not forget. I bumped into the guy and he started

63
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:39,940
shooting wildly. Got no bounties anymore. They're all gone. Back to square one. We're good.

64
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:50,980
Stagecoach is where exactly are you right now? I already have it marked.

65
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:56,870
Why do I have so much money? Because I just did a couple missions where I made a lot of money.

66
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:07,289
I'm a good boy again. Just don't bump into somebody. Don't smash into someone.

67
00:15:08,169 --> 00:15:17,559
Get to the stagecoach without any issues. Pay it. Go to Rhodes. Do the mission.

68
00:15:19,299 --> 00:15:31,669
Do not break the lock. Rhodes Ranch. Take me there. I'm about 45 percent of the way

69
00:15:31,669 --> 00:15:40,220
through the store. 43 maybe. I'm still playing this. We've got somewhere to be.

70
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:56,779
Yeah. Well I couldn't do online because there's all kinds of problems with it. I will give it

71
00:15:56,779 --> 00:16:01,980
another solid attempt before I consider ending the stream. That is certain. So don't worry.

72
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:11,830
And then nothing tomorrow. That'll lead us into Friday for Jack Box Party Pack 5. And then

73
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:17,690
into the weekend we've got the movie night on Sunday. So should be fun this weekend. I'm

74
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:36,360
looking forward to it a lot. Let's progress. Let's progress the story of Red Dead 2.

75
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:54,950
I can't wait to get hammered and watch this weekend.

76
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:04,579
I mean Jack Box is a lot of fun. The movie night's gonna be probably a lot of fun too.

77
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:15,299
I'm also planning on doing that. I'm not sure. I don't know if that's in my plan.

78
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:21,299
We'll see. Maybe I'll have a couple of drinks during the movie night. That sounds fun.

79
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:28,710
We're gonna find my specs in my mouse. I don't even have it listed here, right?

80
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:34,410
What did I do? Is there a command still? I think there was a command at one point.

81
00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:44,839
Oh there it is. Oh yeah there it is. Take a look at that. I've got 176850s.

82
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:58,420
Hey can we talk about this later? We need to learn Dutch. I have a 6850k, a

83
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:09,720
GTX 1080 hybrid. What does that mean? They were planning a visit to the Braithwaite

84
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:14,599
place but John needs to do something for Dutch now so Hosea wants you to join him.

85
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:19,720
I'll join Hosea. Seems to be a lot going on. Yeah I know I wrote that but what does it

86
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:27,299
mean? I don't know what that means. Let's get some free food. That sounds good.

87
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:39,819
The GTX 1080 hybrid has an AIO water cooler. Oh maybe that's what it is. I don't have a TI or

88
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:45,849
anything. Oh this is cool too. Rob a home. Yeah I'm doing that instead.

89
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:52,170
Is your people there? Jack of weights or english lovers? I have a death header.

90
00:18:53,289 --> 00:18:59,609
It's the only mouse I've owned in probably 10 years. My dad would say that no politics was

91
00:18:59,609 --> 00:19:04,809
politics. That old world bullshit it ain't got no place here. Why? Because there ain't no judgment

92
00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:10,809
here. Most folks hate the negroes. They hate the redskins. I just don't have uh. When you

93
00:19:10,809 --> 00:19:14,569
get used to a mouse you kind of can't ever use anything else. I gave everyone just the same.

94
00:19:14,569 --> 00:19:20,650
Well in that case you're gonna want what I just found for us. What's that? I was riding around

95
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:25,529
a couple of days back. I come across this old cabin. A couple of fuckers lazing about outside

96
00:19:25,529 --> 00:19:30,970
all liquored up. I didn't think nothing of it. But then I come across this hunter down by the

97
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:36,329
river. He tells me they're a stick-up crew. Says they hit a train a couple of days back

98
00:19:36,329 --> 00:19:40,569
near Emerald Ranch. Nice fellow he was. Shared a bottle we did. Then I robbed the

99
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:46,490
blind. You believed him? No reason not to. If he's right it'll be a big haul for us.

100
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:51,609
Hey gamers. Maybe more but I reckon you and me we could take them real easy.

101
00:19:52,809 --> 00:19:59,019
What the hell. Let's go check it out. Them sons of bitches think they're mean.

102
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:06,490
They're about to get a lesson in mean. You just keep your cool you hear me. These missions

103
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:10,809
are a lot of fun because you actually make a shitload of money doing them. Not that I need

104
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:17,450
money but it's been nice to have it and never have to worry about it. Follow behind Sean.

105
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:21,690
Oh your horse is named Sean too. That's kind of cool.

106
00:20:34,069 --> 00:20:36,150
It's a bit of a ride. Oh well we got time.

107
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:53,539
That is my horse. Oh well cool. I miss Sean. Me too. I want to just go dunk on people in

108
00:20:53,539 --> 00:21:20,420
multiplayer. You mean get dunked on in multiplayer? No. Should we be talking to him? Come on man.

109
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:28,410
What were you doing right looking for the take? I got a lot of nose for these things.

110
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:31,930
Duchess always honored us to get out there and bring in money ain't he?

111
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:37,130
And rightly so. I ain't like some of them others back there sitting around waiting to be

112
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:43,529
told I go after it. I see you sitting around planning. I mean I don't need no cuddling like

113
00:21:43,529 --> 00:21:49,609
the rest. Have you played multiplayer yet? Yeah. We tried it for a few hours earlier.

114
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:53,849
It did not work. Well it half worked.

115
00:21:57,369 --> 00:22:05,130
I'm getting rock star server problems probably every 30 minutes or so every 20 minutes and

116
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:11,609
then it upped in frequency and it started happening every like five minutes so we decided

117
00:22:11,609 --> 00:22:14,410
we were going to take a break from it for like an hour to do a couple story missions

118
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:19,210
play this for a little bit and try it again see if it gets any better in a couple hours.

119
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:28,819
What's that box boy his tent for then? Camp funds supplies in fact you don't know

120
00:22:28,819 --> 00:22:33,700
that suggests you clearly ain't put much in it. I always pay me way don't you worry.

121
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:39,299
How long am I gonna stream? You're sure you scope this place out right?

122
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:43,779
Yes see that's why you want the job. Probably for at least another few hours.

123
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,980
You're still a doubter. I ain't just some dumb kid.

124
00:22:47,539 --> 00:22:53,380
Four hours or so probably. And you sure don't keep it bottled up inside.

125
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:57,380
I would assume. Made a good show in there didn't I?

126
00:22:58,019 --> 00:23:01,059
You got knocked down. Ah that's what you two should remember.

127
00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:04,420
Quick make a joke. We got paid. Um um um.

128
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:10,089
Got knocked down didn't you? No that was us.

129
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:15,259
Did you get split off with Mac? A guy a guy and a guy walking to a

130
00:23:15,259 --> 00:23:18,779
bar. The guy behind the counter says what are you guys doing here?

131
00:23:18,779 --> 00:23:22,299
Guy number one says my wife's gonna be angry. Guy number two says

132
00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:27,769
so's mine. Guy number three. Jenny didn't even make it that far.

133
00:23:27,769 --> 00:23:32,119
All right we're nearly there. Hard left coming up.

134
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:56,980
I was getting a text. I do have oh I know what it is. I know what it is.

135
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:01,299
I got a coffee table. My coffee table is coming in.

136
00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:07,849
Yes yes. Here let's make sure we keep one of them alive. That's where they

137
00:24:07,849 --> 00:24:10,650
stash the money. Hope you know what you're doing.

138
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:19,960
That was a terrible punch line. Um oh that's right I was telling a joke.

139
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:28,119
Guy number three uh something about about something about a ferris wheel

140
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:31,240
and he was eating and I think he dropped it. I forget what happened

141
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:37,700
after that though. There's one of them outside. This is

142
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:42,019
good. It is. Leave it to me. I do the talking.

143
00:24:42,019 --> 00:24:59,750
You hang back. Slowly slowly. I did find the aliens. I did.

144
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:04,039
That was what? That was a long time ago.

145
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:08,180
Weirdly enough I found that I think in the first six hours of me playing the

146
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:13,420
game. I'm gonna give you and your daddy about

147
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:16,619
five seconds to get the hell out of my property boy.

148
00:25:16,619 --> 00:25:20,460
Look we don't want no trouble. We just thought you might like to know

149
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,019
we passed a big posse alarm and headed this way.

150
00:25:23,019 --> 00:25:26,789
Now it doesn't have a coming up beast. What?

151
00:25:26,789 --> 00:25:32,490
Where? Right here. It's a marker. Here come the rest of them.

152
00:25:32,569 --> 00:25:53,750
We've got what?

153
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:04,549
No. No.

154
00:26:05,269 --> 00:26:28,059
Can I wake him up? I was stuck in the doorway and I pressed r2.

155
00:26:28,059 --> 00:26:31,019
Look I I'm gonna put the fire out and then pull the lever underneath.

156
00:26:31,019 --> 00:26:44,359
Don't worry I got it. Oh look a stash box. Oh well the game

157
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:50,440
found it for me. Thank you game. I really appreciate the help.

158
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:57,700
What was that? Double action revolver. That's kind of cool.

159
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:17,819
I'm not leaving yet. Hold on. Wait a minute. No that's my skull field though.

160
00:27:17,819 --> 00:27:34,740
What's better when this is clean? Hold on. Is the skull field better?

161
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:39,539
Um I mean kind of. Accuracy. It's much more accurate.

162
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:43,140
Fire rate's lower but now that I think this thing sucks.

163
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:50,619
Because I have two skull fields and they are beautiful.

164
00:27:50,619 --> 00:28:02,980
All right. Anything else? This guy died I guess.

165
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:07,500
Is he dead? He wasn't dead when I looked at him before.

166
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:22,170
No he's alive see. Take the meats. Not at all.

167
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:48,900
Search the cabinets. Free gin. I'll take it.

168
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:58,200
Where was the money? Where's the money? I know it's a secret little spot.

169
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:08,470
Oh there's money right here. 15 bucks. Pretty good.

170
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:24,099
Piss in the fire. You can't pee in this game so I'm sorry.

171
00:29:24,099 --> 00:29:28,180
Can I not get the secret? Whoa whoa whoa.

172
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:34,579
Oh that's wrong. Maybe they have to tell you where it is.

173
00:29:34,579 --> 00:30:07,720
I don't think I can get it. No prompts. No nothing.

174
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,759
Read chat. It's it's in the wall behind the bed.

175
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:22,119
I I just was there. The wall behind the bed. Wasn't I just over here?

176
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:27,049
I don't think I can get it without his prompt. Yeah you can't unless the

177
00:30:27,049 --> 00:30:30,819
NPC tells you. See I you can call me stupid for hitting

178
00:30:30,819 --> 00:30:33,059
the guy in the face of the barrel earlier.

179
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:58,839
Let's go girl. No the piss code. I can't get it without him telling you.

180
00:30:58,839 --> 00:31:02,440
Yeah I wouldn't that would make sense. Otherwise you could just stay there all

181
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:12,069
day and just walk around and find it. All right Joseo what do you need?

182
00:31:12,069 --> 00:31:17,450
This is not Joseo. Not at all actually.

183
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:32,630
Holy shit. Come on I gotta get the head exploding

184
00:31:32,630 --> 00:32:02,700
achievement. Trophy earned. 100 heads exploded with shotgun.

185
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:11,369
So we've got uh probably some cool stuff here. These are bad

186
00:32:11,369 --> 00:32:22,569
guys so it's okay. I mean yeah. Look for a lock box.

187
00:32:22,569 --> 00:32:28,490
That's a lock box. If I was a lock box I'd be this one.

188
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:38,900
Medical box actually. Miracle cure. I can't take any more of it.

189
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:43,859
Opened miracle tonic. I might as well just use one right.

190
00:32:43,859 --> 00:32:47,460
Where's the mirror? All right potent miracle tonic. Opened miracle tonic.

191
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:50,519
Just take it and pick up the other one.

192
00:32:50,519 --> 00:33:04,890
Okay I think that's it. That's the most important thing at least. Oh no this

193
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:17,750
can I open this too? Yeah. Yeah. Hey. That's all you have in there is hey.

194
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:24,519
Uh assorted biscuits. Feeded the horse.

195
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:32,380
Corn. This is just stocking me up on food. If you piss in the fire it gives

196
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:39,529
you a code for unlimited lives. I don't want it anyways. Who wants

197
00:33:39,529 --> 00:33:52,869
unlimited lives right now? Check one more time.

198
00:33:52,869 --> 00:34:02,759
Ah hello there. Don't mind if I do. Who wants to live forever? No I don't

199
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:07,799
want to. Why would you want to live forever?

200
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:14,579
Okay instead of living forever could I choose a different option?

201
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:17,940
Could I just you know once I'm once I'm gone can I

202
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:21,300
like unlock an ability instead of oh I want to be alive. Live forever.

203
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,500
No just every like 100 years. No no probably

204
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:28,340
30 years. Every 30 years I just want to turn into like a spirit and just

205
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:31,380
kind of see what's going on. Just like walk around and look at stuff.

206
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:36,739
You know every 30 years just oh here we go. Oh okay what so what's going on now?

207
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:49,510
What's the world like now? You can do that now just be a hermit. Yeah but

208
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:53,750
you can only do that for like two times. You can go live in a cave and eat

209
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:57,510
dirt and like ping in a cup and drink it and like eat rabbits and stuff.

210
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:00,869
And then come out in 30 years and look around and be like holy shit.

211
00:35:00,869 --> 00:35:06,500
But you can only do that like twice. I'm talking literally forever.

212
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,500
What's what if the world is destroyed and then you can just turn

213
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:14,869
it off. You can just after you wake up for that

214
00:35:14,869 --> 00:35:18,070
time and it's like well this is the world is just a smoldering crater right

215
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:21,349
now. Oh okay like um I would not like to do

216
00:35:21,349 --> 00:35:24,389
this again but I would want to do it at least.

217
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:28,500
No no no no no no no. No that's not a good idea. That'd be awesome

218
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:32,340
because if you kept doing that imagine like what would happen.

219
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:35,380
Like we're talking about an entirely new like

220
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:40,099
species. If you woke up every 30 years and the world was just abandoned

221
00:35:40,099 --> 00:35:42,820
like in five million years this probably gonna be like a weird fucking

222
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:51,989
new creature that takes over the whole planet.

223
00:35:52,550 --> 00:36:03,320
We're talking about living forever versus waking up every 50 years just to

224
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,280
kind of see what's going on. What are you doing?

225
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,800
Every hundred years yeah. Selling it back to where it came from.

226
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,239
I ain't got a market for it. They made it. Imagine waiting

227
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:17,559
five million years for bacteria. Stuff look kind of lonely out here.

228
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:20,440
I think we'll cut ourselves a deal. Yeah and then you could just observe

229
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:23,480
forever. You and Dutch was just doing your duty when you

230
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:27,880
requisitioned it. Waking up every hundred years.

231
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:35,260
And you get you get fast travel and you get 30 minutes.

232
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:39,420
Right like we'll see you later. Spend 10 minutes in like

233
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:43,980
Rome. What's going on here? Well that's interesting.

234
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:50,570
Spend 20 minutes in fucking Boston. What's Boston like?

235
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:54,730
So what exactly are we doing? This is the moonshine we took.

236
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:58,409
We're like an hour or something. Like two hours.

237
00:36:58,409 --> 00:37:03,530
What would the point be if you can't affect anything?

238
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:06,570
Well then it's time we made a formal introduction.

239
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:09,769
Why would you want it? Don't you just want to know?

240
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:13,849
These are two big old plantation houses. All I keep hearing is they hate

241
00:37:13,849 --> 00:37:16,409
each other so much they can't see past it.

242
00:37:16,409 --> 00:37:20,440
I know. I've seen it. There's a gray boy

243
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:24,360
and a brave white girl carrying on a secret affair.

244
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:29,639
I've been well. What are you doing? Use the reins damn it.

245
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:35,739
The mind boggles. You think there's a street sweep to that guy?

246
00:37:35,739 --> 00:37:39,420
They don't seem too involved in the rest of it but maybe.

247
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:43,420
Well I'm sure there's money in this for us somewhere if we can get in the

248
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,260
middle of it. There's a type of jellyfish that's

249
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:49,780
immortal. Hold on this is this is beautiful.

250
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:57,179
This is actually beautiful. Where in the map even are we? This is a sort of weird

251
00:37:57,179 --> 00:38:45,500
road. Have uh. Did I get him? Why is this guy invincible?

252
00:38:45,500 --> 00:39:05,639
Okay. Where's my scope? I have like a rifle don't I?

253
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:09,719
Horses got him. Hey that that horse got him without being checked.

254
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:18,820
That's not fair.

255
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:37,900
You may happily shoot me if I do. Okay okay.

256
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:43,030
Single player griefer. Oh don't sit on the back of that man.

257
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:47,769
Please don't sit on the back of that. We'll be watching you. You heard the man.

258
00:39:47,769 --> 00:39:59,260
Driver proceed please. No I'm just. It is so tempting though you're right. It

259
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:02,730
really is. Just to drive him off the cliff

260
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:17,130
and just ghost ride him. Out something. Out in the hills thought.

261
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:20,250
Thought maybe you was in the market for it. For what?

262
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:23,610
Some liquor. I ain't in the market for what's already mine.

263
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:28,329
The way we see it it's ours. Well with us possessing it and I checked all over

264
00:40:28,329 --> 00:40:31,210
for the life of me. I couldn't see your name on it.

265
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:37,880
Oh here comes the whole family. I know it seems that's easy enough.

266
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:41,719
Want to do a deal. Where do you sell that stuff?

267
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:45,159
Dollar a bottle. Give us 50 cents. It's already

268
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:49,480
ours. Well look on it as a reward for finding the property.

269
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,000
Alternative is we go sell it someplace else. The alternative is

270
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:59,800
you get shot. Now who wants to get shot over a bottle or two of liquor?

271
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:07,059
Pay the man. Really? Hosea quite the negotiator.

272
00:41:07,059 --> 00:41:10,980
Pleasure doing business with you. And listen

273
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:15,059
we didn't take it. At least not without orders. Oh I know exactly who

274
00:41:15,059 --> 00:41:20,340
gave you your orders. Old Sheriff Gray. You know what?

275
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:24,019
I don't want it. In fact sir now you can do me

276
00:41:24,019 --> 00:41:27,139
a favor. There's an extra 10 bucks if you do.

277
00:41:27,139 --> 00:41:31,380
Drop the stuff into Rhodes. Head over to the tavern run by Mr. Gray

278
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:35,699
and give the stuff out for free. Hush now.

279
00:41:35,699 --> 00:41:39,940
I believe they call that a promotional expense.

280
00:41:40,019 --> 00:41:43,380
They do. As you wish they do. That's true.

281
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:50,039
Come on Arthur let's take it out of here.

282
00:41:50,039 --> 00:42:02,889
All right next stop the Rhodes Saloon. Here we go. Take the moonshine to Rhodes

283
00:42:02,889 --> 00:42:04,809
Saloon. I finally sold those cornwall bonds.

284
00:42:04,809 --> 00:42:09,449
Got close to a thousand for them. I wanted more but not bad considering how hot

285
00:42:09,449 --> 00:42:11,849
they were especially after that bloodbath in

286
00:42:11,849 --> 00:42:16,230
Valentine. No not bad at all. Apparently

287
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:21,989
gonna play fibbage. What is in that fifth party pack?

288
00:42:21,989 --> 00:42:25,909
I don't know what's in it. I've seen a couple of random clips of what's in it

289
00:42:25,909 --> 00:42:34,019
but I don't know every single game. We'll find out on Friday.

290
00:42:34,019 --> 00:42:37,380
This could get ugly. You and Dutch already have that

291
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:40,500
thing going on in town with the sheriff.

292
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:46,260
Yeah Mr. Gray. That's it. Now we're uncertain ourselves in his

293
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:52,170
blood feud. We'll need something. I ain't playing

294
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:56,489
dressing. You know how I feel about that.

295
00:42:56,489 --> 00:42:59,849
Of course you're not. He gave you three hundred dollars to do this. You're a

296
00:42:59,849 --> 00:43:04,250
clown's idiot bro. 300 bucks is a lot of

297
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:08,250
money. I'm the clown. Back in like the 40s here.

298
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:13,610
Just and keep quiet. Even you can do that Arthur.

299
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:19,159
I have to do that.

300
00:43:19,159 --> 00:43:27,000
Smoke this pipe. The 40s? Yeah. Bring your lip for it. Yeah somebody got like the 1740s.

301
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,239
Like the 1640s. Perfect. What about you?

302
00:43:31,239 --> 00:43:37,750
What did you think I meant? You can't speak. 19?

303
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:42,309
Yowzers. You know what else people say? Yowzers.

304
00:43:42,309 --> 00:44:17,739
Don't get mad. Little rocky. Why don't

305
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:20,380
they make like a gta or like a red dead type game

306
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:24,039
in caveman times?

307
00:44:24,039 --> 00:44:35,460
I'll keep it and stay calm now. For mama she loved you so.

308
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:39,139
Just a shame you had to strangle her in her rage.

309
00:44:39,139 --> 00:44:44,099
Grab two cases of that stuff and follow me.

310
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:49,099
Rockstar making a medieval europe game. I'm sure it would be amazing but

311
00:44:49,099 --> 00:44:55,579
you know they can only do so many things. Although I can't say I'm too

312
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:59,900
sure how well they would handle melee combat.

313
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:07,239
Hey this is my brother Fenton. Don't mind him. Don't

314
00:45:07,239 --> 00:45:11,159
Madden. Fenton? He's turned idiot. He killed our mother but it weren't his

315
00:45:11,159 --> 00:45:14,119
fault. How'd you boys? How'd you boys like a couple of

316
00:45:14,119 --> 00:45:17,960
bucks? I bet you would. I love Jose. Jose is awesome.

317
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:22,760
We're in the new trade of advertising. Which is an American art form about

318
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:26,280
ensuring people buy the correct things. I don't know.

319
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:31,000
One more dollar. Says give us half an hour. What harm can we do in half an

320
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,320
hour? Go along now. Enjoy the money.

321
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:40,739
Come on Fenton. Let's hand out the liquor.

322
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:45,980
Go behind the bar and let's see what. Cool.

323
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:49,579
Combat is fine in rockstar games with an S

324
00:45:49,579 --> 00:46:00,409
with an S on it. That's my brother Fenton.

325
00:46:00,409 --> 00:46:04,570
He's a bit funny but boy can he pour drinks fast.

326
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:07,769
For the next 30 minutes the drinks in this year bar

327
00:46:07,769 --> 00:46:13,190
in this year town are entirely free.

328
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:36,059
Raise the bottle. Let's go. Pour it. All right take it.

329
00:46:36,139 --> 00:46:51,079
Oh wait wait wait. Pour the bottle. How do I serve it?

330
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:55,860
Here take this one too.

331
00:46:58,409 --> 00:47:02,010
You sure are playing the idiot role well.

332
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:17,690
Hey I'm gonna take one of these boys. I'm trying to put it down.

333
00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:26,969
Okay so my boy Fenton can sure pour drinks fast.

334
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:50,019
Too fast one would say. I still have the same pipe in my mouth.

335
00:47:50,019 --> 00:47:53,460
Are you sure this is alcohol and not like fucking like

336
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:57,059
molly? Like what the hell am I serving these people? Like ecstasy?

337
00:47:57,059 --> 00:48:10,469
Good evening gentlemen. Quiet libation. You. Me. You're the bastards who stole

338
00:48:10,469 --> 00:48:15,269
the liquor we was gonna buy. We're in advertising. Come on in.

339
00:48:15,269 --> 00:48:21,059
It is moonshine that's right. Boys get them.

340
00:48:21,059 --> 00:48:36,619
And just like that we had one more coming in.

341
00:48:44,039 --> 00:48:49,349
Oh they're help. Uh oh. I don't know how to pour drinks. I don't know how to do

342
00:48:49,349 --> 00:49:02,090
anything else. Jose Jose Jose Jose Jose Jose Jose.

343
00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:14,579
Got him. What the fuck? I got him.

344
00:49:14,579 --> 00:49:37,300
Ah there we go. Stairs. I can't move. I can't move. I can't move. That didn't

345
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:48,780
work. Please turn up your sensitivity.

346
00:49:48,780 --> 00:50:08,360
Who the fuck? All right give me the repeater.

347
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:11,980
I want a better repeater than that. I don't have like a better repeater

348
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:15,159
than this shit. Is it on my horse or something?

349
00:50:15,159 --> 00:50:21,139
Probably. Looks like they're about to until you

350
00:50:21,139 --> 00:50:30,039
said that. More to my right.

351
00:50:30,039 --> 00:50:40,980
Was that guy was that bad guy? Hey careful who you're shooting at.

352
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:44,260
That was not a bad guy. Well I mean what the hell are you doing standing

353
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:48,340
there? You need to get out of the way man.

354
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:53,619
Outlaws around. You don't want to be accidentally identified as an outlaw.

355
00:50:53,619 --> 00:51:01,300
Because they're just either whoever's around I'm gonna have to beat it.

356
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:16,219
I'm being attacked from all sides. How dare he stand in town?

357
00:51:16,219 --> 00:51:19,820
Well what it's just not only standing in town but standing just still

358
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:29,059
staring at me. I just yeah I got why he's got one shot.

359
00:51:29,059 --> 00:51:32,980
How dare he look in my direction. Come on Arthur. We're gonna get out of

360
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:38,309
here Arthur. Doesn't look like it Arthur. Over

361
00:51:38,309 --> 00:52:06,090
there to your left. Oh jeez Arthur. I'm sorry the guy

362
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:17,900
was looking at me. Well behind me is actually in front of us.

363
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:22,420
See look at these guys are just standing here. You understand that

364
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:24,900
those two guys are just standing around.

365
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:29,059
They just happen to be bad guys this time.

366
00:52:29,059 --> 00:52:45,449
That was a bad idea.

367
00:52:45,610 --> 00:52:57,340
Oh whoa whoa what was that? No these are not okay. That guy's

368
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:09,400
gonna be okay. Oh no he's not anymore.

369
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:26,980
Oh yeah you don't that's what I think that killed me is they hit the liquor.

370
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:32,650
Uh give me some tobacco. You see any more of them? Who thinks so?

371
00:53:32,650 --> 00:53:40,630
Oh never mind never mind. Jesus all this over a few bottles of booze.

372
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:44,070
I reckon it's more they don't want another gang on their patch.

373
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:47,269
I was online. Something I'm gonna try again because it wasn't working very

374
00:53:47,269 --> 00:53:51,909
well. Okay we'll give it a try soon here.

375
00:53:54,019 --> 00:53:59,909
Another mission or something. We'll give it a go again.

376
00:53:59,909 --> 00:54:05,690
Weird flex what? What?

377
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:11,050
What was it? Advertising. You think that woman set us up?

378
00:54:11,050 --> 00:54:17,059
No I think so. Maybe. This place is odd.

379
00:54:17,059 --> 00:54:21,579
I keep seeing those fellas. Some local militia.

380
00:54:21,579 --> 00:54:26,070
Clearly not too happy to have some new competition. I'll go visit old mob

381
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:29,510
Braithwaite. See what's what. I gotta pee again.

382
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:32,869
The chest is filling up again slowly but surely.

383
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:36,150
Part of me thinks we just get ourselves good and lost.

384
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:39,670
But we still need a lot more money before that can happen.

385
00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:45,989
So for now let me go give old Mrs. Braithwaite some of this moonshine as

386
00:54:45,989 --> 00:54:50,869
well let's call it a peace offering. Sure.

387
00:54:50,869 --> 00:54:54,070
This guy's old me.

388
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:02,070
I wouldn't mind. I mean he seems like he's pretty with it.

389
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:10,219
Play the entire Kingdom Hearts collection on stream.

390
00:55:10,219 --> 00:55:13,500
So what do you think? I don't think so. About what?

391
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:17,179
Defying folks around these parts. Oh real nice.

392
00:55:17,179 --> 00:55:21,179
Oh my god I'm gonna pull my ear off. On the one side we've got the gray family.

393
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:26,539
Scots degenerates drunkards the local law. You couldn't make this stuff up.

394
00:55:26,539 --> 00:55:30,619
Rich is creasing. This thing is jammed in my ear. Wedged all the way in.

395
00:55:30,619 --> 00:55:34,780
And I just yanked on it accidentally moving my butt around and I just pulled off my ear.

396
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:39,739
We believe in gold and in the middle of it all you got some

397
00:55:39,739 --> 00:55:47,820
inbred retelling of Romeo and Juliet. Exactly. So what you boys thinking?

398
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:52,440
We try to rob them both.

399
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:58,739
Everybody in the camp. Why not? Because we got all men in three different states after us.

400
00:55:58,739 --> 00:56:03,059
Last thing I want is to get us into trouble but we need money. Now we have

401
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:06,820
the opportunity here to put ourselves in the middle of something ain't nobody

402
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:10,739
gonna know we was here because even without us these fools

403
00:56:10,739 --> 00:56:14,820
are gonna kill each other anyway. Okay well Hosea's gone back to see that

404
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:19,300
Braithwaite woman. Good Hosea should definitely take the lead on this.

405
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:24,099
I sent Sean over to Braithwaite manor too. Now you can meet up with them

406
00:56:24,099 --> 00:56:28,500
or join John and Javier at the Gray's place. Something to do with the

407
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:32,500
Braithwaite's prize horses. How the hell did we get in at the

408
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:35,460
Gray's place? Sheriff Gray kindly put in a word with his father.

409
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:38,179
Can I have your ear? I'm making a voodoo doll.

410
00:56:38,179 --> 00:56:41,699
We gotta convince each family that we're on their side.

411
00:56:41,699 --> 00:56:45,380
Okay but can you not like do anything bad?

412
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:49,219
Can you do like good things to it?

413
00:56:49,219 --> 00:56:54,420
Like can you put it in like a nice hot bath?

414
00:56:54,420 --> 00:57:00,500
I mean make like a tiny little bathtub and put it with like nice

415
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:04,019
perfectly temperature perfect hot water. Just slowly just dunk me in

416
00:57:04,019 --> 00:57:08,340
there let me relax in there right? Now if you will excuse me Arthur I

417
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:14,099
got to write a letter. Set it up on a little beach chair and

418
00:57:14,099 --> 00:57:18,260
put me in front of the right in front of the ocean you know on the beach.

419
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:21,380
So put sunscreen on me and just let me hang out there.

420
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:37,099
What am I talking about? Did you not see the guy that just said he was

421
00:57:37,099 --> 00:57:42,730
gonna make a voodoo doll of me? I'm telling him not to do bad don't

422
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:53,369
like stab me in the stomach with like knives.

423
00:57:53,369 --> 00:58:00,710
I'm not paying attention to chat. Perfect I need to go hunting at

424
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:02,869
some point. I need to hunt I haven't done

425
00:58:02,869 --> 00:58:07,510
any of that. I've done a couple legendary animals but not enough to do

426
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:14,170
any of this stuff. Thanks Pearson. I'm gonna stab a voodoo

427
00:58:14,170 --> 00:58:18,550
version of you with a knife. Don't do that though.

428
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:23,190
Take it on vacation with you and put like sunscreen on me but from the

429
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:27,590
beach. Just great but I nearly got killed back in town.

430
00:58:27,590 --> 00:58:31,659
They caught me robbing from a store and I ran for my life.

431
00:58:31,659 --> 00:58:34,940
You weren't followed here. Arthur Morgan

432
00:58:35,019 --> 00:58:37,900
Of course not. Who do you think you're speaking to?

433
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:43,750
Good girl. Okay I'm gonna make a terrible

434
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:58,090
kill. I'm not gonna say it. All right so who do we want to go to?

435
00:58:58,090 --> 00:59:03,849
I mean I like I like Hosea. So Hosea is kind of where I want to go

436
00:59:03,849 --> 00:59:07,449
because it's Hosea and why would I not do Hosea?

437
00:59:07,449 --> 00:59:10,730
Let's do this mission and then I'm gonna try online again. We'll see if

438
00:59:10,730 --> 00:59:14,869
we can get to work. Wouldn't that just be the size of

439
00:59:14,869 --> 00:59:19,559
a regular pillow? At least give me the benefit of the

440
00:59:19,559 --> 00:59:21,559
doubt of having being a king size pillow.

441
00:59:21,559 --> 00:59:36,139
Please. Not now. Not now.

442
00:59:36,139 --> 00:59:42,860
Can I leave please?

443
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:53,179
Get away from me. You make a twin size bed look like a

444
00:59:53,219 --> 01:00:08,329
California king. You understand how thick my body is?

445
01:00:08,329 --> 01:00:17,019
My ass doesn't even fit on a twin mattress guys.

446
01:00:17,019 --> 01:00:32,010
All right come on horse. You sound thick.

447
01:00:32,010 --> 01:00:43,900
Well thick as in like T-H-I-C-K. C-K.

448
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:55,780
What happened to online? It didn't work. It was kind of broken.

449
01:00:55,780 --> 01:01:06,820
So we're gonna try again.

450
01:01:13,719 --> 01:01:16,920
Like you can never say the word thick ever again.

451
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:25,559
Okay if you were at work right let's say you're at work

452
01:01:25,559 --> 01:01:28,920
and you walk into your boss's office and he's like oh yeah you know can

453
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:31,000
you just give me a hand with something here?

454
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,599
You're like yeah yeah yeah sure. There's a stack of paper over there.

455
01:01:34,599 --> 01:01:37,800
I just I need to just grab it from me. I'm currently I'm about to be on

456
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:41,000
the phone. There's like three stacks of paper.

457
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:46,840
One of them is a very large stack and one of the smaller stack

458
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:49,400
and you're like oh which one do you want? He's like oh the thick one the

459
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:55,320
thicker one. You're gonna go ha thick to your boss.

460
01:01:55,320 --> 01:02:03,510
Is that what that word's gonna turn into? You're gonna get instafired in

461
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:16,599
15 seconds? Hey founders I'm with Mrs. Braithwaite.

462
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:20,699
My associates are already here. Why not?

463
01:02:20,860 --> 01:02:47,289
Ego maniac thinks he's our boss? No I just said thick and you guys

464
01:02:47,289 --> 01:03:04,860
damn I can't ride the motorcycle into the house. Is everything all right?

465
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:12,820
Oh yeah everything's fine. Please come in sir.

466
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:22,389
Everything's okay. This way sir. A gentleman to see you ma'am.

467
01:03:22,389 --> 01:03:26,630
So your friend the other liquor vendor. Hello. Hello ma'am.

468
01:03:26,710 --> 01:03:29,670
Arthur welcome. We're just playing cribbage.

469
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:33,349
Arthur Morgan. Mrs. Catherine Braithwaite. Nice to see you again.

470
01:03:33,349 --> 01:03:37,750
Apparently. So this one he is big and as dumb as he looks.

471
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:41,510
Well he's surely big but his intelligence is a matter of some

472
01:03:41,510 --> 01:03:44,469
conjecture. Some say he is as dumb as he looks but

473
01:03:44,469 --> 01:03:47,989
I think well he's not quite that dumb.

474
01:03:47,989 --> 01:03:50,869
So these other boys going to Caligahal. He's so sick of that.

475
01:03:50,869 --> 01:03:54,710
We could take care of that for you but one hates to be coarse. There is

476
01:03:55,190 --> 01:03:58,869
the question. Oh yes you see he is dumb. Oh we've got money Mr.

477
01:03:58,869 --> 01:04:03,110
Matthews. Thick yeah he's also he's very thick and dumb.

478
01:04:03,110 --> 01:04:07,829
Thick. You yanky numbskull. Hey childbirth just the most beautiful

479
01:04:07,829 --> 01:04:32,599
mare on earth. Seems a lady. The young one says it.

480
01:04:32,599 --> 01:04:39,880
Childbirth is gross. What? Ready let's get out of here.

481
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:47,139
Why'd you just say that? You was quiet and I took everything I had.

482
01:04:47,139 --> 01:04:51,699
That son of a whore. Come on Morgan pick up the pace here.

483
01:04:51,699 --> 01:04:55,900
I'll shove that silver spoon down his throat

484
01:04:55,900 --> 01:05:00,860
and pull it clean out of his ass. A smoke fucker.

485
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:06,820
What she got us doing at the grand court. Oh that's gonna be a

486
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:19,690
bingo for me Arthur. She said it'd be fitting she did.

487
01:05:19,690 --> 01:05:23,050
I don't think in this hell of a way quite fitting my boot up your hook.

488
01:05:23,050 --> 01:05:30,949
No just snotty old bitch. Maniac driver.

489
01:05:30,949 --> 01:05:34,809
Can I do one thing without destruction?

490
01:05:35,690 --> 01:05:42,489
Um it's it's faster. I'm going to get there faster.

491
01:05:42,489 --> 01:05:46,250
I just saved a good two minutes right there.

492
01:05:55,769 --> 01:06:01,610
So far we've destroyed the break weight still. I'm gonna pay for those fences.

493
01:06:01,610 --> 01:06:04,329
They're just invoice men.

494
01:06:04,329 --> 01:06:11,860
They were saying oh for a second. His dialogue didn't even.

495
01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:16,900
Grays English. You not worried about them grays.

496
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:20,500
And what sense? Well they know you.

497
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:26,219
Now what? I'm gonna hide in the wagon. I'll go hiding back.

498
01:06:26,219 --> 01:06:31,219
If you can act now stop us from getting into a fight before we're

499
01:06:31,219 --> 01:06:34,739
ready. I will try. You're going too fast.

500
01:06:34,739 --> 01:06:47,800
Going too fast. I'm not going to go that far.

501
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:56,219
Change Arthur's point of view. Okay this feels so sneaky.

502
01:06:56,219 --> 01:06:59,579
No I'm staying here. I want to be inside this.

503
01:06:59,579 --> 01:07:07,769
We're here stay out of sight. We'll do the talking.

504
01:07:07,769 --> 01:07:23,559
Okay just drink the booze. What you want boys?

505
01:07:23,559 --> 01:07:29,719
I there was a ting a ting at the saloon. There was a ting at the

506
01:07:29,719 --> 01:07:34,519
saloon. Well I'm delivering the supplies.

507
01:07:34,519 --> 01:07:38,360
You want a bottle friend here?

508
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:46,340
I got really long arms. I mean you know I've come from Donegal

509
01:07:46,340 --> 01:07:52,179
in Ireland. Yeah they said you'd understand

510
01:07:52,179 --> 01:07:55,940
there's some kind of incident at the saloon in town. I was told to bring

511
01:07:55,940 --> 01:07:58,980
this up here. Ask no questions I'll tell you no lies

512
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:02,099
Sort the business out. Is it just one guy?

513
01:08:02,099 --> 01:08:05,780
Hey before the officials got there they said. Okay

514
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:09,860
drive this way I'll show you how to get there. Oh thank you friend.

515
01:08:09,860 --> 01:08:14,969
Have a drink Sean. Do I have to hand him a drink?

516
01:08:14,969 --> 01:08:20,810
All right I'm gonna with both hands as hard as I can grab his ankles

517
01:08:20,810 --> 01:08:24,329
and pull him as hard as I can through here.

518
01:08:24,329 --> 01:08:29,479
You've got a country you've got here. I'm not as fine as Connemara but fine

519
01:08:29,479 --> 01:08:33,880
nonetheless. My people come from Scott.

520
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:38,439
Ted you and I are nearly brothers.

521
01:08:40,039 --> 01:08:46,979
I'm kind of jealous. I feel like I belong up there to laugh and talk.

522
01:08:46,979 --> 01:08:50,579
Just over here. Yeah straight down the path here.

523
01:08:50,579 --> 01:08:54,420
It's getting so I can barely keep track of all these deliveries coming in.

524
01:08:54,420 --> 01:08:57,619
Yeah and they said they was looking for more drivers in town.

525
01:08:57,699 --> 01:09:02,260
I jumped at that chance. I never been there to kick a bit of honest work out

526
01:09:02,260 --> 01:09:05,699
of bed. Is he floating? You folks been

527
01:09:05,699 --> 01:09:09,939
having a hard time of it have you? Yeah Mr Gray's got a heap of problems

528
01:09:09,939 --> 01:09:11,699
right now with another family around here.

529
01:09:11,699 --> 01:09:15,699
No he's not. Much covetous lowdowns trying to sabotage his life here.

530
01:09:15,699 --> 01:09:20,340
Disgusting. Oh dear oh dear I'm sorry to hear that Hamish.

531
01:09:20,340 --> 01:09:23,779
Sounds like you definitely deserve that drink. No I'm not gonna

532
01:09:23,779 --> 01:09:28,260
What are you talking about? Just in there.

533
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:40,250
Right you are. You can unload it here.

534
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:47,130
In here? The horse is like a swift one. Am I just gonna be in here?

535
01:09:47,130 --> 01:09:51,109
Nothing. It's grand. Am I gonna have to

536
01:09:51,109 --> 01:09:53,590
jump out and jump scare this guy and punch him in the face or something? How

537
01:09:53,590 --> 01:09:59,909
does this not work? Quite a place you boys have got here.

538
01:09:59,909 --> 01:10:04,069
Reminds me one of them big houses out in Dunnegal.

539
01:10:04,149 --> 01:10:09,829
Real fancy places they was Hamish. Real fancy because if some folks got all

540
01:10:09,829 --> 01:10:12,789
the money they can build quite the fanciest

541
01:10:12,789 --> 01:10:17,270
places in the world. Well the average man subs on

542
01:10:17,270 --> 01:10:21,989
shy yeah yeah yeah okay.

543
01:10:24,550 --> 01:10:35,899
Take his hat. How you getting on? Good.

544
01:10:35,979 --> 01:10:42,359
You already got these things ready. Okay.

545
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:48,060
It seemed like the quickest way. There's plenty of guards out there.

546
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:52,460
Here's how I feel. Should have shot him with a shotgun. No that's too much.

547
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:56,439
You head over to the dry barn. Sure. And you?

548
01:10:56,439 --> 01:11:03,449
I'll deal with the fields themselves. We coat everything in moonshine and then we

549
01:11:03,449 --> 01:11:06,489
light things up with these little fellers here.

550
01:11:06,489 --> 01:11:10,329
Thankfully it ain't rain and that old barn over there should go up like a

551
01:11:10,329 --> 01:11:12,810
torch. How many of these boys you think you

552
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:17,529
need? They should do it. Let's head out.

553
01:11:17,529 --> 01:11:22,300
That'll do it. Look once they get wind of us

554
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:26,380
there'll be no turning back so move quickly. Of course.

555
01:11:26,380 --> 01:11:30,539
I'm rebel stock boy. I was barb burning down manor houses.

556
01:11:30,539 --> 01:11:35,340
Burn quietly. All right so we're gonna

557
01:11:35,340 --> 01:11:38,380
torch the fields.

558
01:11:59,420 --> 01:12:03,100
Sneak around. Which way are we going? Am I in his way?

559
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:08,439
I'm not fucking up his AI right?

560
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:16,199
Make him drink the moonshine.

561
01:12:16,199 --> 01:12:28,789
You might as well take a sip right?

562
01:12:37,350 --> 01:12:48,810
Were they? Were they? Were they alerted?

563
01:12:48,810 --> 01:12:52,229
Quiet. There's someone coming on the left. Yeah and that guy's

564
01:12:52,229 --> 01:13:07,590
god damn it. That noise. That was fucking loud.

565
01:13:07,590 --> 01:13:12,810
This one didn't. Strange. But you got there.

566
01:13:12,810 --> 01:13:19,079
Tools. Payroll. Okay. Payroll. That's the magic word there. Payroll.

567
01:13:19,079 --> 01:13:23,609
Sure. See you later. You hear that? Payroll.

568
01:13:23,770 --> 01:13:28,600
Yeah. Let's get this job done first okay?

569
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:34,939
I'll take care of this fella. No I'm just kidding. I'm not gonna do it again.

570
01:13:34,939 --> 01:13:39,659
Joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. No I'm just kidding.

571
01:13:39,659 --> 01:13:41,020
We'll be at the barn when you're done.

572
01:13:41,020 --> 01:13:51,380
Going down fields will pull on it. We want chitchat.

573
01:13:51,380 --> 01:14:01,210
We want shipping. Will you let me do this? He's not gonna let me do it.

574
01:14:01,210 --> 01:14:03,609
When hiding among tobacco plants guards will not be able to see you as

575
01:14:03,609 --> 01:14:07,640
easily. Okay how much do I have to pour?

576
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:21,609
All right that's good. Where is that guy facing?

577
01:14:21,609 --> 01:14:27,479
Well he's facing this way. I'm gonna wait till he turns around.

578
01:14:27,479 --> 01:14:35,260
Or will he turn around? Turn up the game volume?

579
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:45,029
Is he gonna just look over here the whole time? A lot of moonshine in here

580
01:14:45,029 --> 01:14:50,100
apparently.

581
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:54,659
Okay yeah you just have to do it until he says he's satisfied.

582
01:14:54,659 --> 01:14:58,579
So I'm gonna go across. Oh dear. Oh dear.

583
01:14:58,579 --> 01:15:02,260
Okay this guy facing this way. Not for now.

584
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:10,220
I'm gonna wait till he crosses back again. This is the only guy that I need to

585
01:15:10,220 --> 01:15:21,779
worry about. On this side at least. Okay.

586
01:15:21,779 --> 01:15:45,239
Dump it. Music is dying. Angry goat music.

587
01:15:45,239 --> 01:15:49,399
I gotta go across that way. I wonder if you

588
01:15:49,399 --> 01:16:00,779
turn around. Probably. Not really. I could go to the left.

589
01:16:00,779 --> 01:16:09,079
Or uh no I'm not gonna go now. Once he comes back this way I think he can

590
01:16:09,079 --> 01:16:20,600
make it. Turn turn turn. Turn before it's too

591
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:34,380
late. Thank you. All right. Cause a problem over

592
01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:39,420
here too. Turn up the mic. Who's mic? My mic?

593
01:16:39,420 --> 01:16:57,989
That should do it. Long mission huh? One more on the other side.

594
01:16:57,989 --> 01:17:04,500
Anybody else looking over here? Or can I just go right behind him right now?

595
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:08,710
Pretty sure I can get behind him right now. Yeah. It's gonna be a long

596
01:17:08,710 --> 01:17:23,529
It's not something something Far Cry 3. Barn. I should be able to

597
01:17:23,529 --> 01:17:33,130
wrap around. Should I go for it? It's uh no no. Should I go for it?

598
01:17:33,130 --> 01:17:40,600
No he's gonna turn. He's gonna turn. I'm gonna get seen when he turns.

599
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:45,800
I coulda gone. No I couldn't. Do it you wuss. No I don't want to do this mission

600
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:48,840
again. I don't want to fail this. I'm gonna

601
01:17:48,840 --> 01:18:05,640
have to go around him. Actually maybe not. I'm gonna just go

602
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:20,659
this way. Yeah. Just go wrap around now. Right

603
01:18:20,659 --> 01:18:38,420
down there. There's no more guards around here right? Am I?

604
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:47,689
Nice. This a quick dowsing as well. Dowsing the guy? Just the guy.

605
01:18:47,689 --> 01:19:06,180
Thanks you go Arthur. You too. Let's get out. Would you look at that.

606
01:19:06,180 --> 01:19:13,210
Yeah well let's go loot yourselves a fat cigar.

607
01:19:13,210 --> 01:19:27,960
Did we get it? Okay we got it. You almost ran into the field.

608
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:31,380
I did almost run into the field. You are correct.

609
01:19:31,380 --> 01:20:25,619
We lost the horses. Uh okay apparently the horses are gone.

610
01:20:25,619 --> 01:20:39,479
I'm right next to you.

611
01:20:57,779 --> 01:21:01,460
Forehead yeah. Right in the forehead.

612
01:21:01,460 --> 01:21:12,920
Now this is really cool though. It's uh interesting.

613
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:26,579
It is kind of hey get out and shoot the bad guys.

614
01:21:26,579 --> 01:21:30,020
I was about to shoot a bad horse.

615
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:50,390
We did good. Let's go. Let's go. Looky here you get them horses free marker.

616
01:21:50,390 --> 01:21:58,970
The horse is free. The horse is free. The horse is not free.

617
01:21:58,970 --> 01:22:09,779
Free. Let's get the hell out of here. I'm just getting thrown off.

618
01:22:09,779 --> 01:22:13,220
Right in the fire. I know I would probably absolutely do it.

619
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:32,140
Gotta leave them. Leave them. Straight out the main gate. Come on.

620
01:22:32,140 --> 01:22:43,060
Oh we don't have to jump over those. Wow.

621
01:22:43,060 --> 01:22:46,010
Wow.

622
01:22:56,039 --> 01:23:04,420
At least the music is overpowering. Music's pretty good.

623
01:23:04,420 --> 01:23:20,039
I think we lost them. Yeah we did. Quite a nice. I didn't read the whole

624
01:23:20,039 --> 01:23:22,840
thing. What was the whole thing? The rest of the fight don't just put us

625
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:27,000
into the middle of here. I hope him and Jose are riding it.

626
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:31,260
There's some money at the end of it. What now?

627
01:23:31,260 --> 01:23:35,100
Head on back to camp. It's loud. You coming?

628
01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:42,090
Um yeah. Sure.

629
01:23:48,039 --> 01:23:55,510
Turn the mic up. My my mic is currently uh actually it's funny you

630
01:23:55,510 --> 01:24:00,710
say that because I am investing in a new

631
01:24:00,750 --> 01:24:08,220
uh audio system. So I will be sounding much better than I could

632
01:24:08,220 --> 01:24:13,050
weaker to because I'm actually going to use a

633
01:24:13,050 --> 01:24:19,050
I have a XLR device but it's not necessarily like

634
01:24:19,050 --> 01:24:24,340
compressor and gain and I'm trying to I want to get one.

635
01:24:24,340 --> 01:24:28,899
I'm not going to do too much to it because I just want to make the audio

636
01:24:28,899 --> 01:24:33,300
cleaner and be able to change on the fly easily

637
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:41,109
how loud or soft I am. So so I'm not going to really add that

638
01:24:41,109 --> 01:24:45,079
much equalization or compression so I'm not going to sound

639
01:24:45,079 --> 01:24:51,029
that different. I'm just going to be able to adjust it easier.

640
01:24:51,029 --> 01:24:54,390
All right so what time is it? Is it time for us to try

641
01:24:54,390 --> 01:24:58,550
online again? I think it might be where you can turn the volume up. The

642
01:24:58,550 --> 01:25:01,989
volume is up as loud as it can go. This device that I have this plugged

643
01:25:01,989 --> 01:25:07,340
into is not the greatest. I mean it's a

644
01:25:07,659 --> 01:25:14,819
Scarlett Solo so it's good but it's really really hard to use.

645
01:25:14,819 --> 01:25:22,579
The thing is incredibly finicky. I think I gave everything I needed.

646
01:25:22,579 --> 01:25:26,020
Well I have $3,700 though. Yeah hold on.

647
01:25:26,020 --> 01:25:30,659
Let me give them some money. Do this mission first? Okay

648
01:25:30,659 --> 01:25:47,779
we'll do this last mission. I'm gonna give like 300 bucks

649
01:25:47,779 --> 01:25:59,479
and is there anything new in the ledger? I don't think so.

650
01:25:59,479 --> 01:26:09,289
I do need more provisions though. Let's buy it all.

651
01:26:09,289 --> 01:26:26,390
Buy it all. Well I can't do anything. Everybody gives two bucks. Well I'm gonna

652
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:34,170
give more than that. Hey Dutch you uh you decent in there?

653
01:26:34,170 --> 01:26:39,619
No that's not the front of his tent. That's the back of the tent.

654
01:26:39,619 --> 01:26:43,289
Whoops. Wait what? Yeah no it doesn't matter.

655
01:26:43,289 --> 01:26:54,340
Open the tent up. You don't you don't want me to come in?

656
01:26:54,340 --> 01:27:06,279
Sit. Should I just wait for him? Dutch?

657
01:27:06,279 --> 01:27:19,739
Uh what is wrong with his arm? What is he doing?

658
01:27:22,739 --> 01:27:34,579
I can't walk in. I'm drying right now. Something's wrong with him.

659
01:27:34,579 --> 01:27:50,310
Take his hand. Just grab his hand. I can't do anything. All right well I'm

660
01:27:50,310 --> 01:27:57,579
just gonna. I just ate something. Whatever.

661
01:27:57,579 --> 01:28:13,029
Oh candy. Are you sweating yet Dutch? Of course I'm sweating.

662
01:28:13,029 --> 01:28:17,270
We're in some disease ridden swampy desy whistling shithole.

663
01:28:17,270 --> 01:28:21,189
I meant about what Trelawney said about. I like it. It's got candy.

664
01:28:21,189 --> 01:28:24,630
Such but maybe a little gentle perspiration.

665
01:28:24,630 --> 01:28:29,510
Until we know more ain't too much harm in wasting good liquor on sweating.

666
01:28:29,510 --> 01:28:36,470
So? So I think you should pay Mr Trelawney a visit and find out exactly

667
01:28:36,470 --> 01:28:42,569
what he knows and who he spoke to. Take Charles with you.

668
01:28:42,569 --> 01:28:46,250
You got it. Or the side of the pair of you would make a statue

669
01:28:46,250 --> 01:28:52,039
sing out its secrets. Okay. Go to Charles.

670
01:28:52,039 --> 01:28:56,619
Hey Charles. You and I are gonna be working together here.

671
01:28:56,619 --> 01:29:00,380
Like your new home? Nope. Wrong guy. I won't miss that other place that's for sure.

672
01:29:00,380 --> 01:29:07,140
Hey Charles. Keep your nose clean. I need you for some business in town.

673
01:29:07,140 --> 01:29:24,779
Come on. Okay. Come with me. Why does the screen keep flashing?

674
01:29:24,779 --> 01:29:29,140
I don't. I don't see anything on my end.

675
01:29:29,140 --> 01:29:36,100
Hopefully that's not something wrong with your computer.

676
01:29:36,100 --> 01:29:43,739
Is he coming? No. Where is he? Why do I think everybody's the same

677
01:29:43,739 --> 01:30:00,390
character? What? Where am I going? What? Get on the

678
01:30:00,390 --> 01:30:11,159
horse. Why is my game fucking up? What?

679
01:30:11,159 --> 01:30:30,500
I can't get on the horse. Okay. That was weird.

680
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:36,500
I rode too close to the camp. Well he was on a horse. We were both.

681
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:44,199
We were hitched and I was walking right next to him.

682
01:30:46,060 --> 01:30:50,300
That fool of a sheriff who runs that town. I knew Dutch was gonna play him like

683
01:30:50,300 --> 01:30:53,899
a fiddle. Stop yelling at me. Working for

684
01:30:53,899 --> 01:30:57,739
another. Interesting. All right. Let's do it.

685
01:30:57,739 --> 01:31:02,630
I'm in plain sight. Dutch calls it.

686
01:31:02,630 --> 01:31:06,149
We almost sandwiched that guy. Spirits seem good.

687
01:31:06,149 --> 01:31:10,729
In the new camp I mean. We got some space between us and that mess now.

688
01:31:10,729 --> 01:31:14,949
Ain't she? No more picketins for a while.

689
01:31:14,949 --> 01:31:18,310
Got some corn.

690
01:31:18,310 --> 01:31:21,989
Dutch don't seem too worried about it. I can't believe they're still coming

691
01:31:21,989 --> 01:31:24,310
after us. We didn't even get away with the

692
01:31:24,310 --> 01:31:26,949
money. Yeah but they don't know. So we'll try

693
01:31:26,949 --> 01:31:30,630
online again after this mission. See if we can get another uh decent

694
01:31:30,630 --> 01:31:34,229
session out of it. I've only met him a couple times but he's

695
01:31:34,229 --> 01:31:42,819
he's a strange one. Feed Otto. He's just a cockroach and fancy

696
01:31:43,140 --> 01:31:47,699
Otto ate earlier today. Before I started streaming he ate.

697
01:31:47,699 --> 01:31:52,420
We just need to find him before we add some delicious dog food.

698
01:31:52,420 --> 01:32:01,850
I think it's just up here. Easy. Recognize that one with the fire

699
01:32:01,850 --> 01:32:06,890
outside. Wait didn't I? I think I jumped off this roof already.

700
01:32:06,890 --> 01:32:23,640
Yeah I did. Search the caravan. Well so it seems. That's not a clue

701
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:33,939
but it's hair pomade. A clue. Spilt uh somebody spilled a plant.

702
01:32:33,939 --> 01:32:43,850
You see anything there? Tactatactatacitus

703
01:32:43,850 --> 01:32:49,189
Kilgore Mining Company Certificate. Interesting.

704
01:32:49,189 --> 01:32:56,739
What do you think? This food's barely touched.

705
01:32:56,739 --> 01:33:00,739
Looks like you have to get hurry. A little draw over here.

706
01:33:00,739 --> 01:33:06,760
Nothing. Can't take the snake oil. What else we got for clues?

707
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:11,560
Nothing on the well. There is something else here.

708
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:29,159
No. Bed. Bed's not made so recently. What about the sink?

709
01:33:29,159 --> 01:33:34,520
Bathtub. There's some blood here. Blood and bathtub.

710
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:45,909
But no body. Look. Okay right apple. Might as well take the apple. Never

711
01:33:45,909 --> 01:33:57,350
mind. Chat demands to see Otto. He's

712
01:33:57,350 --> 01:34:00,550
downstairs doing his thing. I'm not gonna go hey

713
01:34:00,550 --> 01:34:03,430
come here dog and I'm gonna bring you upstairs and put you in front of a

714
01:34:03,430 --> 01:34:06,229
camera. No he's having a good time being a dog

715
01:34:06,229 --> 01:34:10,819
downstairs.

716
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:29,689
Let's follow the track. He's sleeping on his bed down there. He's

717
01:34:29,689 --> 01:34:34,890
he's happy. He's very happy down there.

718
01:34:41,060 --> 01:34:46,840
They could be 20 miles away by now. We can track them that far if we get to.

719
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:52,859
I'm alone. He was in here earlier. He still ain't sure. He has a very short

720
01:34:52,859 --> 01:34:58,060
attention span. He gets bored very easily. So if

721
01:34:58,060 --> 01:35:00,939
he's in here with me. Oh he's lying down on a bed or a

722
01:35:00,939 --> 01:35:04,539
blanket back here. Oh okay. After two hours he's just like

723
01:35:04,539 --> 01:35:06,699
get me out of here. I don't want to be here. I hate this.

724
01:35:06,699 --> 01:35:10,460
And I'm like all right. I let him out and he just like has like this

725
01:35:10,460 --> 01:35:14,649
zoomies for a little while. He goes downstairs and he hangs out.

726
01:35:14,649 --> 01:35:18,250
Maybe he gets a little snack or something.

727
01:35:18,250 --> 01:35:44,439
Where the tracks go? I think the tracks lead this way.

728
01:35:44,439 --> 01:35:52,979
Well that I was going the wrong way wasn't I? Well I found him.

729
01:35:52,979 --> 01:36:00,739
He's just right here. Excuse me. Yeah have you seen him? We're uh

730
01:36:00,739 --> 01:36:09,720
we're looking for our friend. I don't think he's here.

731
01:36:10,039 --> 01:36:15,930
Have you seen a strange sort of fella? Sort of formal?

732
01:36:15,930 --> 01:36:24,569
Do Otto and Midas get along yet? They do. They're good buddies. He uses a cane.

733
01:36:24,569 --> 01:36:29,380
Looks a lot like this one. That guy's getting up. He's ready to throw a

734
01:36:29,380 --> 01:36:36,539
punch. I want him to throw the punch first

735
01:36:36,539 --> 01:37:02,579
game. Interrogate. Where is he?

736
01:37:02,579 --> 01:37:14,229
He's Trelawney. I don't know anything. No. Really. Yes. You go to hell.

737
01:37:14,229 --> 01:37:20,229
Tell me now you son of a bitch. Okay. Two punches I'll take.

738
01:37:20,229 --> 01:37:23,989
They took him to a cabin over by the cornfields.

739
01:37:23,989 --> 01:37:29,590
Which cornfields? Left. Down the path there by Braithwaite Manor. Right

740
01:37:29,590 --> 01:37:36,250
there. Okay. That it? You got any more info

741
01:37:36,250 --> 01:37:59,779
from me? I should do it. Choke slam him. How do I make

742
01:37:59,779 --> 01:38:15,819
the horse go? Whatever. I didn't mean- I was trying to

743
01:38:15,819 --> 01:38:25,960
make him like run. That guy had 25 bucks on him. All right

744
01:38:25,960 --> 01:38:29,640
looking for the the path this way. I think there's a way around so we

745
01:38:29,640 --> 01:38:31,399
don't have to go through the Braithwaite's place.

746
01:38:31,399 --> 01:38:36,100
Okay. I'll let you leave. I've spent enough time there

747
01:38:36,100 --> 01:38:45,020
after you then. I'm good. What do you think they want with Trelawney?

748
01:38:45,020 --> 01:38:52,729
Could be any one of a hundred things. Just depends if any of them involve

749
01:38:53,369 --> 01:38:56,890
us. You think he'll talk? Of course. You okay over there?

750
01:38:56,890 --> 01:39:00,409
I'm good. Tell his own sister to save a train fare.

751
01:39:00,409 --> 01:39:08,340
He don't know how- He don't know. At least I don't think he does.

752
01:39:08,340 --> 01:39:13,029
I don't know if he still deals with him. Always disappearing for weeks on end.

753
01:39:13,029 --> 01:39:20,489
He's got his uses. Well loyalty matters to Dutch. Of course.

754
01:39:20,489 --> 01:39:24,810
Dutch Vanderlin. Let me tell you boys something.

755
01:39:24,810 --> 01:39:32,149
It's Dutch Vanderlin's voice. Nobody can do that voice.

756
01:39:32,149 --> 01:39:39,289
He has the most distinct voice I've ever heard.

757
01:39:39,289 --> 01:39:52,520
It's so deep. It's so distinct. I have a plan. No. I have a plan.

758
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:57,579
I have to be four or five octaves lower.

759
01:40:00,779 --> 01:40:03,899
But the one thing about Dutch that's interesting is when he yells

760
01:40:03,899 --> 01:40:10,460
he goes from this to- It's actually really funny. He's like now you get

761
01:40:10,460 --> 01:40:20,680
those boys out of here and bring them to the other side.

762
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:32,729
I love it. It's so real. His voice just

763
01:40:32,729 --> 01:40:36,970
breaks when he gets to a certain amount of power behind it.

764
01:40:36,970 --> 01:40:46,970
His voice is too powerful. I love Dutch's voice so much.

765
01:40:46,970 --> 01:40:58,170
If only I was that talented. When are we trying online again after this

766
01:40:58,170 --> 01:41:02,260
mission? After this mission I'm gonna go take

767
01:41:02,260 --> 01:41:08,520
a bathroom break and then after that

768
01:41:08,520 --> 01:41:11,720
we'll try online see if we can get it to work. Another hour or two maybe and see

769
01:41:11,720 --> 01:41:14,600
where we are.

770
01:41:14,600 --> 01:41:17,800
This will be remembered like a good time.

771
01:41:33,369 --> 01:41:41,579
Why don't I take the horse? No horse.

772
01:41:43,899 --> 01:41:49,560
Should I shoot? Look and listen for disturbances in the cornfields.

773
01:41:49,640 --> 01:41:52,439
Disturbances- I gotta look for a disturbance in the forest. Wait what's

774
01:41:52,439 --> 01:41:58,710
this? What was that blip on the map that was

775
01:41:58,710 --> 01:42:11,529
right here? What was it showing me? He's like go that- oh right here right

776
01:42:11,529 --> 01:42:23,189
here. Thanks for being the- what do I do

777
01:42:23,189 --> 01:42:35,859
with them? Set it? Do it. I gotta find the other

778
01:42:35,859 --> 01:42:39,960
guy.

779
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:58,359
I saw the blip over here. Got him. Almost.

780
01:42:58,359 --> 01:43:21,430
Close. To the birds. Birds? Down here?

781
01:43:21,430 --> 01:43:51,300
That way Arthur! Idiot hat tunnel vision. Wait was it- we supposed to do this

782
01:43:51,300 --> 01:43:57,699
together? No. Okay. He dumped his gear. He's

783
01:43:57,699 --> 01:44:08,149
somewhere around here. He's dumped it. Where the fuck were you?

784
01:44:08,149 --> 01:44:11,939
Okay. This is scripted.

785
01:44:12,260 --> 01:44:18,680
Let me take him. Get out of here. He's not your friend.

786
01:44:18,680 --> 01:44:27,739
I'll give you money. Be quiet. Ooh. Nice. That was a good toss.

787
01:44:27,739 --> 01:44:31,819
Come on. You should have taken the money.

788
01:44:31,819 --> 01:44:44,500
I'm a fool. Oh shit. Thank you. Of course. You okay? Yeah.

789
01:44:44,500 --> 01:44:52,149
Fine. Charles that was pretty- that's pretty godlike.

790
01:44:52,149 --> 01:45:16,260
How can they see us here? That was a warning shot.

791
01:45:16,260 --> 01:45:20,979
They sense the disturbance in the corn. All right. I gotta put on the-

792
01:45:20,979 --> 01:45:41,539
Let's go to the school fields. That works.

793
01:45:41,539 --> 01:45:46,359
Let's go back for Trelawney. You all right?

794
01:45:46,359 --> 01:45:52,460
That was easy, does it? Sure don't. Come on.

795
01:45:52,460 --> 01:45:56,140
Let's go see how badly they beat up the slippery feller.

796
01:45:56,140 --> 01:45:59,640
Wonder how much trouble he's brought with him.

797
01:46:00,600 --> 01:46:03,960
Is that a good gun on the ground?

798
01:46:08,439 --> 01:46:12,020
I'm gonna take a look at the gun on the ground.

799
01:46:12,020 --> 01:46:31,340
It's good. I'm gonna take it. What is it? Rare? Whoa.

800
01:46:31,340 --> 01:46:42,199
Rare. I saw rare. Lancaster Peter for rare

801
01:46:42,199 --> 01:46:58,170
rolling rock- rolling block rifle. Rare. Okay. Don't I have

802
01:46:59,050 --> 01:47:05,510
I'll have a bolt action. Well that's kind of cool.

803
01:47:05,510 --> 01:47:15,750
Let me see it. Can we just get Trelawney and go?

804
01:47:15,750 --> 01:47:28,550
It's engraved too. Weapon's clean. Well

805
01:47:28,550 --> 01:47:43,029
that's pretty neat. I have to go- I gotta go put this-

806
01:47:43,029 --> 01:47:51,770
upgrade this and get this all decked out, you know. Through the corn.

807
01:47:51,770 --> 01:47:57,800
Do you need to get on my horse or you got a horse right?

808
01:47:57,800 --> 01:48:03,640
Tactical engraving. Oh you can't with rares. Okay.

809
01:48:03,640 --> 01:48:16,550
Mr Trelawney, where are you? You okay? So who was they? They were bounty

810
01:48:16,550 --> 01:48:20,630
hunters. Attached to Cole Stoddermont. I remember

811
01:48:20,630 --> 01:48:25,109
this guy. They weren't looking for me

812
01:48:25,109 --> 01:48:29,079
per se. What'd you tell them? Not much.

813
01:48:29,079 --> 01:48:35,479
I told them I was an intellectual. Come down here from Oregon.

814
01:48:35,479 --> 01:48:43,819
Good job at the universe. Of course, they didn't believe me. Seems

815
01:48:43,819 --> 01:48:47,340
you stirred up quite a hornet's nest in Blackwater. He made the reference?

816
01:48:47,340 --> 01:48:50,859
Metal Gear stream? What do you mean Metal Gear? It might be best if I stay with you

817
01:48:50,859 --> 01:48:55,020
gentlemen for a while. Can't go back to that caravan now.

818
01:48:55,020 --> 01:48:58,699
All right Charles, you take Trelawney back to camp. I'll catch up with

819
01:48:58,699 --> 01:49:07,220
you. Okay. Looks dumb and thick.

820
01:49:07,220 --> 01:49:13,220
Bounty hunters. Inkerton's law man. Is chapter three incoming here?

821
01:49:13,220 --> 01:49:26,649
More. Perhaps this is it now. We shall see I guess.

822
01:49:26,649 --> 01:49:33,500
So we're still pretending to be, we are still pretending to be

823
01:49:33,500 --> 01:49:41,380
law men. Okay so we are at the five hour mark of the stream. We gave

824
01:49:41,380 --> 01:49:43,300
about two through about just about an hour

825
01:49:43,300 --> 01:49:46,340
and a half in single player. Let's see if it was

826
01:49:46,340 --> 01:49:48,420
enough. I'm gonna grab a drink. I'll be

827
01:49:48,420 --> 01:49:51,800
right back. We're going to try to open up multiplayer again.

828
01:49:51,800 --> 01:49:56,710
I'll see you in two minutes.
