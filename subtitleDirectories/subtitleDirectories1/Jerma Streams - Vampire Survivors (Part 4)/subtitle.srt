1
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:15,980
Hey, what's up? I don't... am I half hour late? Yep, a few things I had to take care of.

2
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:27,140
A few things I had to do. A few things I had to take care of. But the one good thing is, uh,

3
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:33,420
not four. I wanted to make sure I started at least an hour or two early today to avoid

4
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:43,210
any problems with the internet. I had a, uh, naked on stream dream again last night,

5
00:00:46,659 --> 00:00:50,820
and, uh, this one was... I don't... I'm sorry, I don't remember the whole thing.

6
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:59,289
I just remember being turned, and the camera was pointed down. I just remember it was... the camera

7
00:00:59,289 --> 00:01:06,140
was down, and it was like a full-body cam. Where the camera is, in the same spot it is now,

8
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:14,140
just slightly tilted down, and I was turned naked, and like, I mean, actually naked.

9
00:01:16,069 --> 00:01:22,409
And I don't know, my leg was turned up so you couldn't see my... I don't know.

10
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,920
But like, I thought maybe you could. I don't know why I was on... look, I don't know why I keep

11
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:40,500
having this dream. I keep having this dream. I think it's because my brain is telling me,

12
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:47,939
dude, one day, one day it's gonna happen. You're gonna be naked on camera. Just, just like this.

13
00:01:48,739 --> 00:01:55,209
Just like this. I'm like, no, no, I don't want to. I don't want to be naked on camera. My brain is

14
00:01:55,209 --> 00:02:07,159
like, I don't know, my brain's essentially just preparing me. Retirement stream. Dude, just face

15
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:14,060
your fears already. You know, I'm just gonna get it out of the way. I mean, my dreams keep... this

16
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:23,939
keeps happening in my dream, so I'm just gonna do it. Uh, anyways, welcome to today's stream.

17
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:32,060
We'll be live today. We'll also be live tomorrow. Should be a fun time. We've got a line up.

18
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:41,990
Quite the lineup today. Vampire Survivors is in 1.0. Check. Gotham Knights has released.

19
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:48,759
Sponsored. Check. And then we'll end it with Deadly Night, which I was incorrect.

20
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:54,919
That's not a puppet combo game. There is a new puppet combo game. We will play that.

21
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:59,539
Probably closer to Halloween. I want to make sure I correct the record from last night.

22
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:11,319
When is Breath of the Wild? Breath of the Wild will probably end up being...

23
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:25,530
Oh, tomorrow. We'll do Breath of the Wild tomorrow. Tomorrow will be a short stream,

24
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:31,340
though. We're not gonna go... I... this one will go at least six to seven hours, I'm imagining,

25
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:37,060
because we're playing three different games. But tomorrow we'll do maybe a couple of hours

26
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:50,169
of Breath of the Wild. Couple of hours of, you know, Gotham Knights. And then I love it. Let me...

27
00:03:50,729 --> 00:03:55,930
I think people might want to make sure I clear this up, too. Like, the sponsored Gotham Knights

28
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:03,800
stuff is not as over after tomorrow. So it was essentially a mega weekend. What's my favorite

29
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:19,110
movie? There's quite a few. We play Overwatch on Sunday. Gremlins 2 is up, yeah, it's probably

30
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:28,149
number one. But there are quite a few movies that are in, like, the top five. I don't know if I'm

31
00:04:28,149 --> 00:04:35,959
gonna play Overwatch. Overwatch is one of those games that I feel like you have to... you have to

32
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:41,720
play it... I don't just want to jump in and play Overwatch for an hour, because I'm gonna be

33
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,079
terrible, and I'm not gonna even know what any of the heroes fucking do. I'm not gonna know what the

34
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:50,839
maps are, and I'm gonna look like a total dickhead. And I'm gonna get frustrated, because I've spent

35
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:54,920
like 40 minutes total in the entire game, playing against people that have been playing probably

36
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:59,829
for like three weeks. And I'm just gonna be like, well, that was dumb. I'm not doing that ever again.

37
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:07,029
Overwatch is kind of game like all the other like multiplayer type games that are multiplayer

38
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:12,709
pretty much only, where you need to be playing it. Like you have to play these games in a semi

39
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:19,379
frequent kind of way. To be able to, oh yeah, I'm gonna play Overwatch today. But I guess that you

40
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:25,750
do have to start somewhere. But I'm telling you right now, if I play Overwatch one day,

41
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:30,949
I will not be playing Overwatch two, three, four, five, six days, 10 days, a month. It's just not

42
00:05:30,949 --> 00:05:40,040
gonna happen. So weighing that, like what I would rather play Overwatch two, or something,

43
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,639
anything else in the bed, that's probably always going to be anything else, because I don't have

44
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:48,600
the time. I don't want to give the time to Overwatch two to get good enough at it where I can play it

45
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:59,800
and be like, yeah, this is great. cough cough cough cough. When are you gonna play Splatoon?

46
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:12,839
I don't know. There's a lot of games. When are you gonna play scorn? I even said it the way that I

47
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:19,209
It's in my brain forever now. Did you hear that? You heard that, right?

48
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:33,579
I was talking to Holly last night. And she said that as of right now, she's like, it's fucking me

49
00:06:33,579 --> 00:06:39,420
up. Every time something happens, a major event plays out or a big puzzle is done and anything

50
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:46,899
she does or anything she sees, she just hears it in her head. Oh, the door is opening.

51
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:59,079
And here we are. Scorn. She says she hears it. What have I done? I'm sorry. You have scorned.

52
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:08,100
Well, you have to play it. I'll, I don't. All right. I, I think that I like that. It's, I think it's

53
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:14,019
really fun, but I don't want to ruin it. Because I feel like if it's too much, it will be ruined.

54
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:18,970
Right? You don't, I don't want to dilute the joke to a point where it's not funny anymore.

55
00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:23,129
You have to be careful with these things. You guys have to be careful with these things.

56
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:34,939
Do it, ruin it. One right now is okay. No, because there's no reason to do it right now. All we,

57
00:07:34,939 --> 00:07:38,620
okay. All we are going to do is I'm going to play the sound effect and I'm going to see Omega Lul

58
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:45,180
in like the background. You know what I mean? I'm just going to look over here and just see Omega

59
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,220
Lul is like just spammed in the background. Well, when I say background, I mean, because you're in,

60
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:57,189
you're on my monitor right now and I'll be able to see it in my peripheral. So I don't know. I,

61
00:07:57,189 --> 00:08:03,990
why would, there's nothing, there's no reason to play it. We're just all going to go, oh yeah,

62
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:13,079
scored. And then slowly, very slowly, 10 people are going to go. There's no reason to do that.

63
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:17,000
That was like funny when you did it before, but it's not funny anymore. And then I'm going to take

64
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,560
a sip out of a drink and it's going to be scorn. And then 200 people are going to go as like, why

65
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:29,850
did you do that? Like that was kind of funny. The fifth time you did it. Be careful. It's a very

66
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:38,139
careful thing and I'm not going to ruin it. See, all of you thought I was going to do it right

67
00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:48,419
there. Everybody did, but it's not happening. All right. You guys ready? Vampire survivors.

68
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:57,669
1.0 is out. I don't even know what I can unlock in this game right now. So yeah,

69
00:08:57,669 --> 00:09:01,990
we'll play this for an hour or two. Gotham Knights for a couple hours and then boom,

70
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:05,190
deadly night to end it. I want to do it at night because I wanted to be scared. I wanted to be

71
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:14,629
scary. Okay. Here we go. You're a tactical comedian. I need to move this. This is going

72
00:09:14,629 --> 00:09:26,980
to be in a better spot. There we go. Please stop teasing us. Stop. Okay. Um, what happened to my

73
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:38,440
screen? Who did that? Did you, did you do that? All right. I got my tea. I've got my phone. I've

74
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:50,090
got my stuff here. Uh, what am I missing? All right, let's go. Vampire survivors. 1.0. How are

75
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:55,450
you? I don't know. I watched the, some of the clips from yesterday and watched the stream and

76
00:09:55,450 --> 00:10:00,090
stuff from yesterday. Dude, I just, I had just so much blood in my upper body. There's so much

77
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:07,450
blood in my, in my face and my hair. I'm very flush all the time. I just am. If you, okay,

78
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:13,899
if I was naked, I would have like a bright red purple face and then like just pale white.

79
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:18,059
I just have tons of blood. I think there's so much blood in my, in my brain. I think like,

80
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:25,450
it's just, I'm just constantly moving around here. I don't know. I always have like a bunch

81
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:30,250
of blood in my face, but it's not, I don't, I feel fine. You know what I mean? It's old. You're an

82
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:35,669
old man. Drink more water. I drink a shitload of water. Well, you know, I don't drink a shitload

83
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:45,639
of water. I drink enough water. It's due if you have too much niacin in your bloodstream.

84
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:53,690
No, what do you, how do you, what? The other guys have too much niacin. Okay, let's go like this.

85
00:10:53,690 --> 00:11:02,549
Nope. Wrong thing. All right. So what do they add in 1.0? Is, is there a bunch of shit in 1.0

86
00:11:02,549 --> 00:11:11,159
that they added? Why does it keep doing that? I don't like that. There we go. Can you guys hear

87
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:19,019
it? I can't hear it. Why? There we go. What do they add in 1.0? Looks like there's a lot of stuff

88
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:31,419
here. Move your cam to the left. They added a, all right. All right, let's do it. So I'm obviously,

89
00:11:31,419 --> 00:11:40,710
let me see what the unlocks I have to do. Level 80 in the gallo tower. Okay. 15 minutes with

90
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:49,779
consetta and you get shadow pinion. I can do this. 15 minutes with consetta. Hide completed. Yeah,

91
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:54,779
let's do that. So what do you get? You get shadow pinion. All right, let's do this. 15 minutes. I

92
00:11:54,779 --> 00:12:08,169
can do it. Wait, what does that character do? Do I even have that character? I don't even have that

93
00:12:08,169 --> 00:12:22,139
character. How do I get that character? Oh no, yeah, I do. Gains 1% area every level. All right,

94
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:34,149
so area. I'm definitely doing damage. Super, a ton of huge area. Cool down projectiles or no?

95
00:12:34,149 --> 00:12:42,230
I haven't played in a long time. I'm not sure what to do here. Is the best character? I just need to

96
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:51,049
survive 15 minutes. Speed, duration is just good. Movement speed is good. I think I have enough to

97
00:12:51,049 --> 00:12:59,320
do pretty much everything. Do other projectiles because it's good to have. Greed, curse, I don't

98
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:11,529
want to do that. Reroll, skip, vanish. Get them all. Growth is good. Speed is good. You took a

99
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:17,720
shower? That's probably why I look. Yeah, I took a shower. This twitch integration now? Um, well,

100
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:24,740
I don't want to break anything yet. Let's do this first. Stop touching your nose. I am a, I am a

101
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:33,460
face toucher. I can't stop. I always do. Every two or three minutes I go, I just do it. I just do it.

102
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:41,340
Can I, I think I can do pretty much everything. Why am I even? I think, yeah, I can do like

103
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:48,330
everything. Why am I even deciding on choices here? Yeah, I can do almost every single item.

104
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:53,370
All right, cool. Let's do it. So it doesn't matter where I start, right? Just gotta survive for 15

105
00:13:53,370 --> 00:14:04,860
minutes. Let's go for it. Uh, ooh, doesn't matter where, right? How about the library? Wait, what?

106
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:10,860
This one has a, where should I go? Do gallo for the quest. Oh, right. Okay. How long do I have to

107
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:21,960
live, uh, survive for? I don't, what is this shit? Hyper hurry arcana's. Should I do any of this? I

108
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:27,289
shouldn't do it. I don't, I'm just going to go. All right. What is this? What is this ability?

109
00:14:27,289 --> 00:14:46,570
What is it going on? How do I, how do I, do I have to activate it? It's kind of loud. It's better.

110
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:58,809
It's a little loud. What is this thing? Um, ooh, okay. It's the area is bigger. So what whip for

111
00:14:58,809 --> 00:15:10,580
area to change your direction sharply. Does the gun get gun is projectile, right? You have to stop

112
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:14,259
moving to activate it. Whip is, I would feel like the whip would be amazing here. I'm doing whip

113
00:15:14,259 --> 00:15:28,009
because it's area. Oh, okay. I think I get it. Fires one more projectile. Uh, Ooh, I want this

114
00:15:28,009 --> 00:15:40,299
song. A man is amazing. And remember it's area duplicator, more projectiles. I think so. Sorry.

115
00:15:40,299 --> 00:15:51,529
How can I tell what direction it's going to go? Okay. It's whatever direction you start moving

116
00:15:51,529 --> 00:16:09,210
when it spawns. I get it. Cool down. Um, yeah, one more of these. Let's go. It's pretty good.

117
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:17,980
It's kind of cool. It's the last direction of your input. Thank you so much for saying that

118
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:24,009
because I actually did not. I've actually been doing it wrong the whole time. Whip. Let's go.

119
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:51,340
Oh, Oh God. Don't get stuck. I want to make it the project. Um, all right. What Matt,

120
00:16:51,340 --> 00:17:06,380
none of these, um, match, right? Should I do garlic? Garlic is area. Oh, look at all these

121
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:15,099
crunchies up here. All right. Here we go. Skull. Oh, maniac. Do I really want to do that this early?

122
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:25,000
That kind of sucks this early. I feel like I don't want that. Maybe later. Well, hopefully

123
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:34,680
will it come up? Maybe you just get one. Oh, it's just one. It's not more. Oh, I thought it

124
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:45,480
leveled up. Okay. Banish it. Oh, you know, fuck it. Let's go. I'm not like, I've never played this

125
00:17:45,480 --> 00:18:05,220
game before. I'll be all right. Security. Yep. Did someone say the wings were for, um, shadow

126
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:26,549
opinion? Is that legit? That last 0.3 seconds longer, which is better. How come it's I'm

127
00:18:26,549 --> 00:18:42,500
confused. I turned to the left and it shot to the right. Oh my God. 15 minutes. That'll be good.

128
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:54,089
Gallic. Look at that area. Are you so greasy? Um, cause I'm just like a wet, I'm a wet person.

129
00:18:54,089 --> 00:19:01,640
I'm just a moist person. You know, I didn't want to pick that up. People ask, dude, how come you

130
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:07,319
look so young? You look young, man. Wow. How old are you? Well, you look young. And I, you know,

131
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:11,400
I'm just, I'm very wet person. My skin is very, it's always moist. It's always moisturized.

132
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:22,099
If there's another shit, I have a black eye shadow again. I think I do. I, I very like moist,

133
00:19:22,099 --> 00:19:30,759
moisturized skin. So how come it doesn't say it on there? You guys lied to me. Your lighting

134
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:36,950
setup doesn't do you any favors. I don't, I don't care about it doing me any favors. I'm just,

135
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:41,349
I'm just a guy sitting here hanging out. I don't need to buy what you want me to have like studio

136
00:19:41,349 --> 00:19:50,980
lighting in here. I'm just a wet person. Did you guys actually lie to me or does that,

137
00:19:50,980 --> 00:20:06,900
wouldn't it usually say it on the tool tip? These things are probably going to be awesome a little

138
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,700
bit later. I need cool down, right? Cause then it will happen to be like,

139
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:35,930
the odd, these guys take two hits, right? What we got? I'll take the whip. That's fine. Duplicator.

140
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:52,329
Yep. I guess I could just activate it fast. I'm going to go down and get whatever the item is

141
00:20:56,019 --> 00:21:00,819
more. Okay. Yep. Let's get this thing maxed out. You kind of remind me. Well,

142
00:21:00,819 --> 00:21:04,019
you didn't say who I remind you of. So I don't know who I remind you of.

143
00:21:04,819 --> 00:21:26,259
I can't believe this game is read. Is this game still $3? Is it a little bit more expensive now?

144
00:21:29,099 --> 00:21:39,720
Five now. Okay. Yeah. I mean, it's worth more than three dollars. You know what I'm saying?

145
00:21:41,660 --> 00:22:00,740
Ooh. All right. Lightning ring. Although yeah, let's yes. Garlic again. What does garlic level

146
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:14,150
up with? It's not the book, right? Bro. You look like liquid Shaggy. Okay. Wait,

147
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:20,069
I'm not going to look at chat. Do you mean liquid Shaggy as in Shaggy that is made out of liquid?

148
00:22:20,069 --> 00:22:25,829
Cause I talked about how wet I was. Or are you referring to like liquid Shaggy like this?

149
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:30,549
It's me. Liquid Shaggy. Is that what you mean? Like I'm the evil. Like that's what you mean?

150
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:40,980
Okay. I didn't know how exactly what you meant by that because both make sense. Liquid Shaggy.

151
00:22:42,099 --> 00:22:54,980
I'm going to get smashed by that. We're good. All right. This is where it starts to get a

152
00:22:54,980 --> 00:23:23,460
little hairy here. This weapon is actually really good. Stop distracting me. You guys are typing.

153
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:27,700
I see words scrolling up out of my peripheral. I can stop typing. I can see it.

154
00:23:39,319 --> 00:24:02,009
Come on. Thank you. Thank you. I have to go down because it is a thing to collect down there. I

155
00:24:02,009 --> 00:24:24,700
don't know. What even is that? Whip again. I need some more stuff. I haven't seen any garlic in like

156
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:48,809
feels like two, three years. All right. I got max whip as bit rate. We look good. Can you make out

157
00:24:48,809 --> 00:25:21,160
anything that's going on? I'm going down after this. Shit better. What's new in this patch?

158
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:26,599
There's a bunch of stuff. I'll be honest though. I can't really tell you what is exactly in this

159
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:31,640
patch that wasn't in the game before this patch because it's been probably five plus patches

160
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:39,849
since I've played this game. There you go. There's a lot of stuff though. This seems

161
00:25:39,849 --> 00:25:43,380
like there's been a lot of new content, but they'll put on the chat integration.

162
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:48,920
Yeah. I'll turn it on once I get a second here. I just want to do like one. I want to warm up.

163
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:54,680
I want to warm up and play it a couple of times because I don't want you guys to be able to spawn

164
00:25:54,680 --> 00:26:00,119
bosses and I haven't played the game in like a month or two and I just lose. Let me warm up.

165
00:26:11,769 --> 00:26:17,349
What if I, I don't have a, I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's definitely cool down. Both of these

166
00:26:17,349 --> 00:26:39,529
are good. It's definitely this one. Does the spear have a, uh, evolution? I feel like it doesn't.

167
00:26:49,099 --> 00:26:57,960
Ooh, it looks like a gas station employee. What do you mean? Like just a person? I look like a

168
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:21,430
person. Oh, hey, you look, you look like a guy. Yeah. Okay. Like dude, please turn the fog filter

169
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:47,769
off. I want something better than that. D minus two. Dump it. I stole that from Seth.

170
00:27:53,019 --> 00:28:01,109
You look like Peter Pan. All right. All right. Yeah. I look like a lot of people, apparently.

171
00:28:01,109 --> 00:28:06,069
Yeah. I look like Peter Pan. I look like, uh, Jim Carrey. I look like Willem Dafoe. I look like

172
00:28:06,069 --> 00:28:16,700
fucking Kramer. I look like everybody, apparently. Yeah. I look, people look similar. So by people

173
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:21,579
that I look similar to happen to be, I'm sorry. They happen to be incredibly handsome people.

174
00:28:23,029 --> 00:28:30,420
That's all right. Keep, keep telling me. I look like who's wicked handsome out of that group.

175
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:40,650
Don't forget. I do not look like Jerry fucking Seinfeld, dude. No, you can't just because the

176
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:47,779
guy. All right. Just because they have, just because they're a brown hair white guy does not

177
00:28:47,779 --> 00:29:02,420
mean they are Jerva nine eight five. Okay. People that was risky. I did it. Yes, it does.

178
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:39,529
Actually, I don't even want that. You look like my dad. You look like Peter Pan. It's because I'm

179
00:29:39,529 --> 00:29:43,609
okay. And also when I wear like a different colored shirt, it makes me other characters.

180
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:49,259
Hey, anybody else think he looks like fucking Shaggy today? Yeah. Cause I got a green shirt on

181
00:29:50,059 --> 00:30:06,569
dude. Anybody think he looks like fucking Robin today? I got a red shirt on. You do look like,

182
00:30:06,569 --> 00:30:13,059
all right. I do look, I do look like Shaggy. I do. And I do look like Jim Carrey. I do look like,

183
00:30:13,059 --> 00:30:16,980
I look like all these people. All right. I look like Willem Dafoe. I know I get it. Okay.

184
00:30:17,619 --> 00:30:28,660
I get it. That's fine. That's all right. Peter Pan. Peter Pan might be my favorite one for the

185
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:39,220
last few weeks. What is that? Bigger, longer, faster, stronger. It's like a blowtorch.

186
00:30:41,259 --> 00:30:56,259
Holy shit. Oh my goodness. Okay. You weren't lying. Don't, don't, don't give me any ideas.

187
00:30:57,619 --> 00:31:04,819
I will rig up a fucking wire system in this room and I'll play a Peter Pan song and start

188
00:31:04,819 --> 00:31:09,700
to fly around the room. You understand? I will do that. If you, if you keep harping on this

189
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:18,759
and then it'll go to a full cam and I'll just be flying around the room and then I'll sit back down

190
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:38,259
and give me a re-roll on this. This one's definitely a lock. I might do the whole thing,

191
00:31:38,259 --> 00:31:52,630
actually. Do a Batman cosplay. I would be an awful Batman. I would not make a very good Batman.

192
00:31:54,920 --> 00:32:00,519
Guys, I would look, I would kind of look like a dork in a Batman outfit. I'd look like a dork.

193
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:08,789
My posture's kind of, my posture sucks. I'm kind of smaller and my posture's bad. My arms are big.

194
00:32:08,789 --> 00:32:13,849
My legs aren't. I would, I would look like, I think I would look like shit in a Batman costume.

195
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:32,089
I would look weird. I don't think I would look all right. That's the point though. Dude, do you

196
00:32:32,089 --> 00:32:36,569
guys think, and some of you, some of you people, some of you guys in here might be this. I don't

197
00:32:36,569 --> 00:32:43,849
know. If you're huge and jacked and you're just fucking massive, you're like a big muscular dude.

198
00:32:44,569 --> 00:32:50,390
Do you sit around and go like, I'm fucking Batman. I get to be Batman this year.

199
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:52,950
I'm going to be Superman this year and I'm going to look like Superman.

200
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:58,099
Like, do you get ready to put the Bane costume on and be like,

201
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:05,500
I'm fucking Bane. Look at me. You know what I mean? If I was huge,

202
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:10,500
it would, I would not give a shit about being stronger. I would not care about,

203
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:15,140
oh, you can reach higher shelves. Oh, you're a lot bigger and stronger. Oh, I can lift boxes.

204
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:22,680
Nope. Every October 31st, I get to be Superman and I get to really be Superman and I get to look

205
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:33,259
like Superman. I would, I get to be Superman. That's why I think it was cool. You get to walk

206
00:33:33,259 --> 00:33:48,309
around, you know, like this up with your chest out, like citizen. Like you're huge. You get to

207
00:33:48,309 --> 00:33:55,829
pick every October 31st, a superhero that you get to be. You can just do it. Oh, Wolverine. Done.

208
00:33:55,829 --> 00:34:04,099
Give me the metal claws. I can make that work. Style my hair like his. You know, I get to pick

209
00:34:04,099 --> 00:34:17,000
rum every Halloween. Harry Potter characters. You know, I get, I get to be like the Riddler.

210
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:34,099
That's it. I get to be Shaggy, the green goblin. I've even the green goblin. Shaggy's cool. Shaggy

211
00:34:34,099 --> 00:35:04,889
is cool. You are Jack though. No, I used to be. Not anymore. Yeah, dude, if I was huge and I'm,

212
00:35:04,889 --> 00:35:29,690
when I say huge, I mean like, like six, four, like 200 fuck, but you're actually old.

213
00:35:30,699 --> 00:35:41,900
Nobody tell them. There we go. Um, well, I definitely don't want to see this ever again.

214
00:35:45,530 --> 00:36:03,800
Oh my God. All right. Um, cool down, right? Yep. Okay. Uh, be Groggy Gary for Halloween.

215
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:12,760
You could be Santa. No, I couldn't. I would be an elf. The huge guy gets to be Santa. I have to wear

216
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:18,840
the funny hat and the funny shoes and be like walking around my friend who gets to be Santa Claus.

217
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:47,190
So you could be whatever you want for Halloween. You could be the Joker.

218
00:36:48,230 --> 00:37:07,670
That's right. I could, I could. Yeah. All right. There's no way I don't make it to 15.

219
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:19,079
Yeah. Like I've said this before, I'm going to say it again. All you need to do should be a good

220
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:31,300
Joker. Just put the makeup on and go like this. Every other sentence. See my father, everyone will

221
00:37:31,300 --> 00:38:36,630
go. Oh, what do I want for my last item? The clock. What's this? Oh, it's the super

222
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:54,440
manna. You know, you know, who's a, an absolutely fucking hilarious motherfucker that needs more

223
00:38:54,440 --> 00:39:02,840
credit for how funny they are myth. If you guys, if you guys don't follow myths, he, he did this

224
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:08,760
video recently. He did a Joker video where he was doing the Joker as XQC doing the, that famous rant.

225
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:18,739
I was just laughing my ass off. He's, he like did like a Joker XQC thing. It was just like

226
00:39:18,739 --> 00:39:39,000
with like the music in the background. It was funny. Oh my God. Don't die. Oh, that's super

227
00:39:39,000 --> 00:40:14,329
thunder. Oh, the levels are just rolling in recently. That was 11 months ago. Why did I

228
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:30,010
just see that in my feet? Do I open Twitter so infrequently that what do you wait? Hold on.

229
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:44,570
When did he upload that? I saw that literally like one day ago. Somebody must've retweeted it

230
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:57,829
or something. Why did I just see that a day ago? Why did I just see that? It was a year ago.

231
00:40:58,869 --> 00:41:17,929
Do I seriously? What? Why did I just see this? I don't, I don't know. I genuinely do not know why

232
00:41:17,929 --> 00:41:51,989
I just saw that. Oh, you guys lying to me. Okay. Dude, you got to keep up with like your Twitter.

233
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:58,940
Dude, I don't keep up with anything. I don't even use the computer. I'm just telling you.

234
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:04,860
The only time I use the computer is right now with, with you all. I don't use the computer.

235
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:29,449
I don't use the internet. Oh, nice. Oh my God. Look at this. What the fuck? You see that? How much

236
00:42:29,449 --> 00:42:46,329
damage I'm doing. Oh, what is this? All the way. Oh, that means this is the only thing that shows

237
00:42:46,329 --> 00:43:00,460
up forever. I get it. All right. I don't know. Twitter is weird, right? People, I got messages

238
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:04,699
from people saying, Hey dude, why did you like a bunch of like tweets you made in like 2014 or

239
00:43:04,699 --> 00:43:15,820
something? And I'm like, what the fuck are you talking about? I didn't do anything. I don't,

240
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:22,519
apparently I went back and liked a bunch of old tweets. I didn't do that. Does it bug?

241
00:43:31,099 --> 00:43:37,750
All right. Well, Ooh, level up. Oh, that's actually awesome. So it doesn't go to the

242
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:50,260
screen. That's cool. But anyways, TLDR myth is a really, really funny person. Very good on camera.

243
00:43:50,260 --> 00:44:32,090
Really funny. And that's all. That's what I was trying to say. Watch out boss. This guy, you look

244
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:57,179
like a wise guy. Okay. We've evolved. We've evolved. It's no longer. Hey dude, you look like Shaggy.

245
00:44:57,179 --> 00:45:13,559
You look like Peter Pan. You look like a wise guy. Gold fever. Oh my goodness. What's happening?

246
00:45:13,559 --> 00:47:12,570
Why is this happening? Holy shit. Just $7,000. Holy shit. Sweating. No, pretty can't even touch me.

247
00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:46,579
I just stand still. That's not fun. We got to get to level a hundred. Gotta get to 80. Oh, I'll get it.

248
00:47:46,579 --> 00:47:54,380
I got 10 more minutes. I'm going to get to like level a hundred. How's the quality look?

249
00:47:55,019 --> 00:48:13,989
Can you see shit? Oh, I'm like, I'm like talking to something. These games are great. I can just do

250
00:48:13,989 --> 00:49:22,659
this. Gold fever. I'm just going to go down. Holy shit. It looks like it hurt. Liars. Liars.

251
00:49:24,489 --> 00:49:47,420
Myth put that video up on Twitter literally yesterday. Liars. I won. I win. Everybody ban

252
00:49:47,420 --> 00:50:39,880
everybody that said no. I want a massive timeout for five seconds. I don't want to. Okay. Is this

253
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:45,320
game even fun? Yeah, dude. Hey, don't look at what I'm doing here. And she deterred from purchasing

254
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:53,110
this. I got a little bit of experience in the game. Uh, I have dozens and dozens of hours playing

255
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:57,590
this game, I think. So, I mean, I am at a level where I've got all the power ups. I've unlocked

256
00:50:57,590 --> 00:51:02,469
tons of stuff. You're going to be starting at nothing. You can be starting at zero and you're

257
00:51:02,469 --> 00:51:12,699
going to be walking around getting your ass kicked by the first enemy of the game. So just,

258
00:51:12,699 --> 00:51:16,619
just know where you are right now. I have a lot of experience in the game. I'm probably one of the

259
00:51:16,619 --> 00:51:25,190
most, uh, one of the most experienced Empire survivors. Um, no, I don't, I don't need to say

260
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:59,460
it or anything, right? Like, I'm one of like, you guys know, you have those big hands. My God,

261
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:28,250
just die already. Just die already. Oh my goodness. You still alive? Why are you still alive?

262
00:52:29,289 --> 00:53:29,909
Why are you still alive? Why are you so blushy? There's blood in my face. Lots of it. There's

263
00:53:29,909 --> 00:53:47,099
another one. I haven't even killed the first one. I don't think I'm going to get to 100,

264
00:53:47,659 --> 00:54:11,110
but I got to 80. That's all I wanted, right? That is the first one. I can't believe I've made

265
00:54:11,110 --> 00:54:17,179
almost 10 grand. That first money, um, coined insanity, whatever it was. I don't think I've

266
00:54:17,179 --> 00:55:00,630
ever seen anything like that ever again. I put that down so meanly. Evil German. Dark Uga.

267
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:21,019
Do you eat Taco Bell? Yeah, I love Taco Bell. Well, I love one item in Taco Bell and it puts,

268
00:55:21,019 --> 00:55:32,949
it puts Taco Bell at S tier. Uh, Cheesy Gordita Crunch is the only thing that puts Taco Bell above

269
00:55:32,949 --> 00:55:41,820
B. The only thing. Don't, don't come at me with this, you know, oh, you're going to get the,

270
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:51,079
no, don't even come at me with that. Cheesy Gordita's Cheesy Gordita Crunch with a Doritos

271
00:55:51,719 --> 00:55:58,599
Taco inside the Cheesy Gordita Crunch. There will never be a fast food item ever. Yeah,

272
00:55:58,679 --> 00:56:21,960
that will be as good. Never. It's impossible. In fact, I feel like Taco Bell is probably

273
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:30,440
pissed. It's like, oh shit, we made literally the best fast food item to ever exist and no one will

274
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:33,960
ever come close ever again for the rest of the entire time we're still alive in humanity.

275
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:38,519
Like we can't make anything else that people would even care about because we made that already.

276
00:56:53,260 --> 00:57:02,519
And quit and cash in leftover revives. Oh, do I really? I don't really care. All right. I got

277
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:16,710
some, uh, Capella Magna. I unlocked the Shadow Pinyon. I got 500 gold coins. Cool. All right,

278
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:31,929
nice. Nice. What else we got? Hold six different weapon evolutions. Find the Grim Grimmuar.

279
00:57:31,929 --> 00:57:42,650
Find the Magic Banger. Find the Ars Guda. Find and buy the Glass Vizard. Gr, what did I say?

280
00:57:45,510 --> 00:57:55,989
Magic Banger. Find the Great Gospel. You get Limit Break. Inverse Mode. There's a lot. Oh,

281
00:57:55,989 --> 00:58:11,099
my goodness. Look at all this shit. The Trumpet. All right, what should I try to get here? What

282
00:58:11,099 --> 00:58:18,579
should I do? Why did you have a Q-tip covered in lip balm in a plastic bag during juiced?

283
00:58:18,579 --> 00:58:23,190
Um, well, that's very simple. I couldn't explain it because we're in the middle of a show, but

284
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:31,050
so I use this a lot. I do. So I don't, okay, I know that you really shouldn't be using ChapStick

285
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:37,030
that often, but I live in Nevada. I live in Las Vegas and it gets very dry out here. Incredibly

286
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:42,760
dry. Um, so this helps. I try not to use it too. I don't usually use this unless I'm talking a lot

287
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:47,699
because when you're talking a lot, you're essentially drying out your mouth and lips

288
00:58:47,699 --> 00:58:54,070
because the air coming in and out. We're like, blah, blah, blah, blah. So it helps while you're

289
00:58:54,070 --> 00:59:02,469
talking to keep your mouth moistened. If I don't do this, you'll notice I will lick my lips all the

290
00:59:02,469 --> 00:59:13,320
time because if I'm talking a lot, I have to, you know, constantly be licking my lips. I am the

291
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:27,449
fucking joker. No, don't say you're the joker. Don't do that. Stop that. If you say you're the

292
00:59:27,449 --> 00:59:43,639
joker, you're actually the penguin. Don't do that. Don't, Jeremy, don't do that. Don't ever believe

293
00:59:43,639 --> 00:59:48,650
anybody if they say they're the joker, right? People that say they're the Riddler are actually

294
00:59:48,650 --> 00:59:54,519
the joker. People that say they're the joker, they're actually the penguin. People that say

295
00:59:54,519 --> 01:00:09,099
they're the penguin are telling you the truth. They're telling you the truth. Penguin mains are

296
01:00:09,099 --> 01:00:12,940
based. You already said this before. Yeah, there's like a bunch of new viewers. Come on, I gotta get

297
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:31,030
my, I just like scraped you. Who are you then? I don't, I don't, I don't know. We're talking

298
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:44,099
into all of Batman? You'd be the scarecrow. I don't know if I'd be the scarecrow. You'd be

299
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:53,289
Peter Pan. Oh yeah, Batman's famous rogues gallery. Peter Pan. I wouldn't be Mr. Freeze.

300
01:00:53,369 --> 01:01:00,090
I wouldn't. I don't want that to spill on me. All right, uh, let me do,

301
01:01:00,889 --> 01:01:03,050
I'll do one more with the twitch integration and then we'll move on,

302
01:01:03,050 --> 01:01:23,420
play some Gotham Knights. This is work. Let's see. I think it's on. Is it on?

303
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:41,460
Hold on, let me do this. All right, yeah, it's on, I think. So what do I want to try to go for here?

304
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:46,179
Six different weapon evolutions survive 30 minutes with either Gallo or Divano.

305
01:01:46,179 --> 01:02:01,960
All right, so I'm going to try Gallo or Divano. Gallo? I don't have either one of those. Gallo

306
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:18,840
or Divano? Am I not seeing it? I don't have either one of those people. Why, oh, why the Q-tips? Okay,

307
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:28,389
so I didn't have any chapstick with me when I was at Juiced and the, um, I was kind of figuring out

308
01:02:28,389 --> 01:02:33,590
where have I, where can I get one of these? I need, I need something to be able to put on. Um,

309
01:02:33,590 --> 01:02:37,639
and there was a, there was a makeup artist that was there and it was like, oh, no, no,

310
01:02:37,639 --> 01:02:41,079
I actually have something. You could use this. It's gonna be kind of weird, but, um, it's like

311
01:02:41,079 --> 01:02:44,599
just a little bit of Vaseline. You can put that there, uh, just a little bit to kind of use that

312
01:02:44,599 --> 01:02:49,460
for what you, you know, needed it for. And I was like, oh, okay, cool. So I used it and I was like,

313
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:54,650
oh, that worked great. And I put it in the pocket and I just forgot it was there and I got called

314
01:02:54,650 --> 01:03:10,710
out for it. Bro, why was it dirty? I don't, I, that I don't know. I feel like it was because of maybe

315
01:03:10,710 --> 01:03:16,389
like the makeup or something when I did it and I got the makeup on it. I don't know. All right,

316
01:03:16,389 --> 01:03:25,079
so where are these? I don't have these two characters. Survive 30 minutes with either

317
01:03:25,079 --> 01:03:40,230
Gallo or Divano. How do I unlock Gallo or Divano? This, Forbidden Squirrels? This is question mark.

318
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:53,960
Oh, Sir Ambrojo. No, it's my coffin. Your mic sounds like shit. No, it doesn't. That's fine.

319
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:58,980
Just pick up stuff you missed on the stages. All right, well, let's just go for it then.

320
01:03:59,849 --> 01:04:06,519
I'm going to go with, what is that, a wheel? Have I ever played with this character? I'm going to

321
01:04:06,519 --> 01:04:15,860
play with the wheel character. More projectiles every 20 levels. Okay, yeah, let's do the wheel.

322
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:19,860
So I'm assuming the ones with the exclamation points on it are, I need to go and get stuff

323
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:27,219
there. So let's do Moon Glow. I also have this, a weird filter on this camera. This camera's weird.

324
01:04:27,219 --> 01:04:45,860
Let's go to Moon Glow. Fancy a new, oh, there it is. Look. Merchant is in all stages now.

325
01:04:45,860 --> 01:04:57,849
Golden Egg? What should I do? What should I do? I'm going to keep the wheel. What is this move?

326
01:04:58,730 --> 01:05:03,429
Okay, so this is a projectile character. Why do I only have one? What's going on?

327
01:05:04,949 --> 01:05:11,059
Oh, you guys have to vote. I can't pick anything. What did you just give me?

328
01:05:17,239 --> 01:05:25,429
Thanks. Look at all these things out here. All right, this is going to be a fucking disaster.

329
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,480
I'm not going to pick up anything yet because I don't know what I want to do.

330
01:05:30,119 --> 01:05:34,980
And I'm not going to touch anything. Twitch, what is...

331
01:05:36,579 --> 01:05:41,820
Yeah, oh, why didn't you start with this? I wonder why. Is it showing all of your names?

332
01:05:44,789 --> 01:05:55,400
That's, okay, that's weird. What am I going to get? I wonder how long it lasts.

333
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:21,929
Oh, thanks for the luck boost. Thanks, guys. All right, you only have like

334
01:06:21,929 --> 01:06:27,289
five seconds to choose, so be ready if you want to participate because I can't do any of this.

335
01:06:28,550 --> 01:06:50,949
It's all up to you. Move your cam so we can see. You can see. Okay, here we go.

336
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:35,219
Lights. What is light sources? I keep trying to pick and I can't. He's melting again. All right,

337
01:07:35,219 --> 01:07:53,480
what is it? How am I supposed to deal with this? I'm level four. This isn't fair. Ah,

338
01:07:53,480 --> 01:08:17,579
it disappears after a minute. Sorry, guys. Get wrecked. Not quite. Is the Twitch integration

339
01:08:17,579 --> 01:08:23,460
for 1.0? I feel like that was not here a month or two ago when I played the last.

340
01:08:25,689 --> 01:08:40,010
Oh, I can't. I forgot. I can't ask questions because all. Okay, I can ask a question if the

341
01:08:40,010 --> 01:08:55,050
answer is one, two, three, four or A, B or C. Guys, what number is the month for April? Oh,

342
01:08:55,050 --> 01:09:14,619
never mind. What just happened? You guys just gave me like a power up or something. I don't know.

343
01:09:14,619 --> 01:09:37,859
Give me the double guns. Don't. Why don't. Why would you give me the wand? You picked. Why would

344
01:09:37,859 --> 01:10:04,949
you pick the wand? You just screwed everything up. Give me double guns, not wand. Great.

345
01:10:05,909 --> 01:10:10,569
So what happens now? Did you guys? You're in the middle of voting by the way.

346
01:10:10,569 --> 01:10:14,979
Thank you. A clueless machine for your support of the stream. Appreciate it.

347
01:10:29,140 --> 01:10:45,510
Definitely keep making these bigger. This thing. These things are great. Actually carts. Well,

348
01:10:45,510 --> 01:10:54,699
what month is March? What number is March? What month is March? What number month is March? Thank

349
01:10:54,699 --> 01:11:39,689
you. A lot of food. Are there any coffins? Okay. Give me the gun. Do the gun. I demand. I command

350
01:11:39,689 --> 01:12:21,659
you to pick one ghost swarm. Uh, I don't know what to pick. Oh, it's ghost swarm times 10.

351
01:12:21,659 --> 01:12:39,369
There's 10 of them at, uh, at Corello. I've been pretty good, but it certainly looked like a

352
01:12:39,369 --> 01:12:47,779
different person. Every stream. Um, sometimes you, your hair is done a different way. You're

353
01:12:48,979 --> 01:12:54,699
if you have facial hair, do you not have facial hair? I will tell you guys that I do get, I do

354
01:12:54,699 --> 01:13:02,619
have a lot of different looks. I sometimes would be clean shaved and then randomly like you'll see

355
01:13:02,619 --> 01:13:08,170
me four days later and I have like a beard. It's just like, where'd the other guy go? Well,

356
01:13:08,170 --> 01:13:39,420
if my hair will be different, I get it. I do base damage up by 30 cool down. I want to,

357
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:45,380
does this thing have an evolution? Cause I want to see it. It's just a huge car that drives around.

358
01:13:46,100 --> 01:14:00,140
I really hope that once I get to like level 30, 40, 50, that you guys don't have to pick every

359
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:04,859
single time when it gets to the, do you want the box or do you want, I gotta make sure I make it

360
01:14:04,859 --> 01:14:26,810
always around the whole circle, 20% more area. Go get all the items on the floor. But you didn't

361
01:14:26,810 --> 01:14:50,439
vote for that. I guess I could, right? Could I just go pick up every single item? Done. Done.

362
01:14:50,439 --> 01:15:04,229
Should I pick up every item on the floor? I don't know. I can't even ask a question because

363
01:15:04,229 --> 01:15:33,500
nobody can answer it. Only do that after you fill every slot. Okay. Three more luck. I didn't want

364
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:53,720
to pick that up. I wanted to save that. I'm shaking my head, dude. I mean, I would say it's probably

365
01:15:53,720 --> 01:16:19,930
two, right? Be dumb. All right. I'm going to get the magnet. There's a lot of stuff on the floor.

366
01:16:20,010 --> 01:16:54,859
Good luck. You're going to have to level up like three times. Thank you. Interesting. Now what?

367
01:16:54,859 --> 01:17:01,989
I feel, okay, this is going to be so messed up here because there are a lot of people that are

368
01:17:01,989 --> 01:17:05,430
on more than a five to 10 second delay on the stream thing on your internet connection and

369
01:17:05,430 --> 01:17:10,470
where you are in the world or whatever. So tons of you guys I think are voting for the like third

370
01:17:10,470 --> 01:17:15,460
level. And that was like the fifth level. I don't, I think this is going to be a little messed up.

371
01:17:16,260 --> 01:17:46,920
Oh shit. All right. I'm making it hard. Okay. Can I even kill these things? Thank God for the

372
01:17:46,920 --> 01:18:13,899
mine carts. Done. This is actually, I thought you guys were going to make like a ha ha killed

373
01:18:13,899 --> 01:18:37,739
the streamer build. Um, but this is actually pretty good. Nice job. Nice work. Thanks, Peter.

374
01:18:37,739 --> 01:19:00,310
I don't know what I did. Oh, I said good job. You're right. Oh, yep. Why do you have such a

375
01:19:00,310 --> 01:19:34,949
crooked face? Um, because I have a crooked face. Mean chat member. Ooh, yep. Get it. Get that. Get

376
01:19:34,949 --> 01:19:42,500
that. That's the big one. That's one of the best items in the whole game. That is the best evolution

377
01:19:42,500 --> 01:20:11,220
in the whole game in my personal. Yes. Hell yeah. Um, I'm not picking up all the items yet. I still

378
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:30,439
have plenty of time. It seems like it's going to be pretty good. These things explode. Okay. Well,

379
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:40,699
yeah, I'm dead. I get to come back, but I'm dead. Dude, how the fuck am I supposed to beat that?

380
01:20:40,699 --> 01:21:09,609
I can revive one more time. That lasts literally forever. Kill them. Oh, I got the merchant and

381
01:21:09,609 --> 01:21:18,500
everything. Okay. That's impossible. I mean, it wasn't impossible. It was just improbable.

382
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:31,449
Wow. You did it. All right. Um, anything. One more. One more and we move to Gotham Knights.

383
01:21:31,449 --> 01:21:37,220
We'll do one more. This time. Don't press the button. That's going to end the run instantly.

384
01:21:37,220 --> 01:21:53,399
Give me the free shit. Who should I play with? I'll let you guys decide this. Who should I

385
01:21:53,399 --> 01:22:10,380
play with? Play with the dog? Dog? Why do you look like Shaggy and Fred at the same time?

386
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:20,810
I'll do dog. And where should I go? Just probably the library stage two. Yeah. Anything with an

387
01:22:20,810 --> 01:22:46,600
exclamation point. Oh yeah. They have relics. All right. I'm going to do the library. Uh,

388
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:53,449
should I turn any of these on or who cares? This dude's got wicked extraterrestrial eyes today.

389
01:22:53,449 --> 01:23:08,140
Okay. Put our con is on hyper and hurry. No, I don't want to hurry. That's annoying to me.

390
01:23:08,140 --> 01:23:20,649
I don't know what I don't know what to do here. Feeling. All right. What's this feeling is doubled

391
01:23:20,649 --> 01:23:27,670
recovering HP damages nearby enemies for the same amount listed weapon projectiles gain up to three

392
01:23:27,670 --> 01:23:36,550
bounces. That's insane. Overall area continuously changes between minus 25 and plus 25% over 10

393
01:23:36,550 --> 01:23:48,409
seconds. Overall duration continuously changes between minus 50 and plus 50%. Enables critical

394
01:23:48,409 --> 01:23:54,199
hits for listed weapons doubles overall critical damage. That sounds incredible. Um, what does this

395
01:23:54,199 --> 01:24:06,140
character start with? The flowers, right? Those are, is that technically a projectile? The ones

396
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:17,050
that bounce. It's not a projectile. It's not listed at all. Do the healing one. Oh, that is listed.

397
01:24:17,130 --> 01:24:33,560
All right. We're going to do that. Why did I pick that up? Give me something good. How often do you

398
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:53,340
get a sunburn all the time, all the time? Uh, I am Irish and Polish. So, I mean, I burn pretty quickly.

399
01:24:54,340 --> 01:25:11,300
My, my, like I very kind of light, um, skin. So like I, it burns very, very quickly. There's also

400
01:25:11,300 --> 01:25:15,140
like other, I mean, I, I could give you my entire, I don't, I don't, I've literally done kind of

401
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:23,960
no, there's no kind of what I've been told. It's like a Eastern, you know, Eastern European,

402
01:25:23,960 --> 01:26:04,810
Irish, I don't know, Polish. Stop doing this to me. The stream is getting angry. Hey guys,

403
01:26:05,529 --> 01:26:34,229
what the, what the fuck would you guys do? I like the dog's basket. Maybe if there wasn't

404
01:26:34,229 --> 01:26:50,939
a inescapable jelly wall, I would be able to get out of here. The heel is so good on this character.

405
01:26:50,939 --> 01:27:04,649
It really is. The song is really good too. This game is just really good. This thing's three dollars.

406
01:27:05,289 --> 01:27:21,699
I hope whoever made this made a really good amount of money. I mean, you deserve it. What the fuck

407
01:27:21,699 --> 01:27:41,989
was that? All right. I kind of like just, um, can you guys give me a weapon that can fucking kill

408
01:27:41,989 --> 01:28:18,760
something? They probably made, they made bank. Don't the cats hurt you? The cats attack you.

409
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:44,279
I see you're going with the animal build. Okay. I see. Go get the item or I forget

410
01:28:45,079 --> 01:29:07,420
and I will forget. Nevermind. Light sources. You like it because it's retro. No, I like it because

411
01:29:07,420 --> 01:29:32,739
it's a really great idea. Guys, how many, we didn't do that. Then who did? You tell me you didn't do

412
01:29:32,739 --> 01:29:59,060
this? Shit. I might die. Just got to get out of there. All right. I need food. Actually good

413
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:33,300
because I can heal, right? The flowers healed. You know what to do. Give me some health here.

414
01:30:36,170 --> 01:30:52,229
Last 1.5 seconds. More projectiles or armor. School. Eventually when I have a bunch of speed

415
01:30:52,229 --> 01:30:55,909
and I have a ton of this thing's leveled up all the way, I will heal to full health in one second.

416
01:30:55,909 --> 01:31:26,220
Just get me there. What's this? I have to kill that, um, Grim Reaper guy. Need the other gun.

417
01:31:26,220 --> 01:31:29,899
Yeah, you need the other gun. Don't forget that. Without the other gun, I'm in trouble.

418
01:31:33,560 --> 01:32:21,380
How do you kill this guy? How do I get rid of this guy? Just evade. Okay. There we are. Stalker?

419
01:32:23,619 --> 01:32:38,420
Dude, how? Cat ate the chicken. Yeah, the cats eat the food and they hurt you. A fully leveled

420
01:32:38,420 --> 01:32:54,579
up cat though I think is pretty good, right? Give me the hell out of there. This guy can't

421
01:32:54,579 --> 01:33:12,630
be killed either? No. Sorry. Don't have to worry about that. How far away am I? All right. I can

422
01:33:12,630 --> 01:33:44,680
get there. Let's get a run. I like how a lot of the songs in this game go like, they all have that

423
01:33:44,680 --> 01:34:03,270
same, uh, like bass drum that just goes, what? You skipped the passive? What do you mean I skipped

424
01:34:03,270 --> 01:34:13,739
the passive? I missed a gift from chat. I did? I'll go back up and get it. Do I want that though?

425
01:34:13,739 --> 01:34:17,739
I feel like I, I thought I'm not supposed to pick up passives until I get what I want.

426
01:34:18,539 --> 01:34:28,380
Or do I want that one? I'm just saying if you jelly well me, I'm uninstalling the game and I'm

427
01:34:28,380 --> 01:34:33,260
going to uninstall the fucking twitch stream. You give me a jelly while I'm uninstalling the game.

428
01:34:33,260 --> 01:34:36,140
I'm just telling you, I'm just being completely honest with you. Yeah.

429
01:34:37,699 --> 01:34:50,359
Actually that thing you just picked is probably worse. There it is.

430
01:34:52,470 --> 01:34:57,989
Ars guda permanently allows to access the list of defeated enemies from the main menu.

431
01:35:00,779 --> 01:35:18,409
What does this do? Oh my God. It's a, oh, okay. It's like a database. All right. Now I'll go back

432
01:35:18,409 --> 01:36:00,630
up and get the nice gift that you gave me. I appreciate it. Almost got me. Didn't get me.

433
01:36:00,630 --> 01:36:05,350
So I, should I pick, do we need any of this stuff? Should I pick the, um, these passives up? I

434
01:36:05,350 --> 01:36:31,960
shouldn't. No, I'm not gonna. It's not worth it. I got to level up. I get the free one from chat.

435
01:36:31,960 --> 01:36:48,569
Does that, doesn't it just take a slot? I got to level up. I'm very underleveled. I'm level 18

436
01:36:49,369 --> 01:37:14,260
and there's 10 minutes. Get the orb. Actually a good idea. Whoever said that, that was a great

437
01:37:14,260 --> 01:37:22,020
idea. And that person for an hour. Tell me what to do on my screen. Oh my God. I'm going to die.

438
01:37:22,739 --> 01:37:52,939
I'm going to, you're going to kill me. Stupid fucking jelly. Well, I swear to God,

439
01:38:04,180 --> 01:38:12,890
what did I, did a cat just eat that? Why did I not get it? Why did I not get that? I think

440
01:38:12,970 --> 01:38:26,310
the cat destroyed that. Oh, where's it? Where's an orb? Wait, this is okay. There's a chest down.

441
01:38:26,310 --> 01:38:46,310
There's an orb. All right. Get the chest first. I'll take it. Now there's an orb up. There's a

442
01:38:46,310 --> 01:39:25,560
chest up. There's a lot of crunchies here to get exactly what I needed. Tons more luck and more

443
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:53,369
projectiles. Keep it up. It does suck that the cats eat the food though. I gotta get out of this.

444
01:39:53,449 --> 01:40:15,909
We go up. Yep. Okay. There's a turkey and then there's up. Where's that chest? Right here.

445
01:40:16,550 --> 01:40:35,350
I don't know. What does a pet even do? One more projectile. Cool. All right. Now give me the orb.

446
01:40:36,069 --> 01:40:56,979
Does it heal maybe? I wonder. Oh shit. All right. I'm in trouble here. It's my brother's birthday.

447
01:40:56,979 --> 01:41:18,539
Say happy birthday. Happy birthday to that person's brother. Happy birthday. No, seriously. What's that?

448
01:41:21,079 --> 01:41:34,149
Oh, I get another one. I don't want that one. Enables critical hits for listed weapons,

449
01:41:34,949 --> 01:41:45,609
which I only have. I don't have any of these. That's pretty big though. Although I only have

450
01:41:45,609 --> 01:41:56,970
one of these. Which one? I could reroll it. Although I think this is probably the one.

451
01:41:59,640 --> 01:42:07,130
It is. It's the only thing that's going to save me right now. Well, now definitely get the cross

452
01:42:07,130 --> 01:42:19,619
upgrade when you can. It's a lot of experience here. I'm not going anywhere for a few minutes.

453
01:42:44,710 --> 01:43:11,739
Yep. I'm going to soak all this up. Oh, I thought you were going to do pentagram. Okay.

454
01:43:11,739 --> 01:43:17,300
Cats are going to kill you. Well, I didn't pick them. You should blame your fellow chatter.

455
01:43:17,859 --> 01:43:37,079
I was going to go with side. Cross is doing so much. Play Peggle 2. No, I don't like Peggle 2.

456
01:43:37,079 --> 01:43:51,430
It kind of sucks. It's okay. It was all right. I think Peggle 1 I had the most fun with.

457
01:43:53,270 --> 01:44:13,029
I didn't. Peggle 2 was all right. You guys have to remember I'm older. So the first one that came

458
01:44:13,029 --> 01:44:26,899
out, I'm always going to have a better opinion of because it's Peggle 1. You know, okay. I do

459
01:44:26,899 --> 01:44:34,180
Peggle 2. I liked the second area. I liked that. I like that character because the song goes like

460
01:44:40,939 --> 01:44:47,689
I don't like the first but the horse. What's the horse's name? Yorn or something, right?

461
01:44:48,329 --> 01:44:54,899
The horse creeped me out. The way the horse does like the facial expressions the horse makes. It's

462
01:44:54,899 --> 01:45:07,819
kind of like creepy. I don't know. The horse is, the horse freaks me out. This dude's scared of a

463
01:45:07,819 --> 01:45:20,020
cartoon. Okay. Don't ever, don't ever jump back in your seat at a horror game when they try to scare

464
01:45:20,020 --> 01:45:42,100
you. It's a fucking 3D CGI cartoon dude. Peggle is a horror game. I win. No, I win. I'm the streamer.

465
01:45:42,100 --> 01:45:48,250
I win. Did you see how many people said true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true,

466
01:45:48,250 --> 01:45:58,140
true. No, I win. I'm the streamer. So I win. Oh my what the hell's happening?

467
01:46:02,060 --> 01:46:16,260
Understand the streamer can never be wrong. Streamer can never be wrong. This is real fun.

468
01:46:16,819 --> 01:46:33,340
Do you mean that sarcastically? It actually is. I've never seen anything like that before. The

469
01:46:33,340 --> 01:46:48,500
crosses are just, uh, this is definitely secure at this point. Good. Ooh. Yep. There it is. So now

470
01:46:48,500 --> 01:46:59,979
this is going to be wild. I need more projectile speed. I need more projectiles. I give me what I

471
01:46:59,979 --> 01:47:31,479
need. Wait, did you guys just do the attractor? Oh, for the, okay. Or, um, the water, right? It's

472
01:47:31,479 --> 01:47:56,710
true. I meant it honestly. Oh, you're good. Don't worry. You're good. Let me look strange because

473
01:47:58,300 --> 01:48:04,220
my camera is flipped horizontally. You are not used to seeing me from this angle. I am though.

474
01:48:05,180 --> 01:48:11,770
So from the other angle, it's weird for me because that's correct. This is how I see myself

475
01:48:12,489 --> 01:48:15,689
when I look in the mirror. So this looks normal to me. It looks weird to you.

476
01:48:16,569 --> 01:48:32,439
The reason why a lot of people think they look weird in pictures is because that's a flipped

477
01:48:32,439 --> 01:48:38,020
version of your face. Well, no, no, no. Yeah. Like the mirror is a flipped version of your face.

478
01:48:38,819 --> 01:48:43,930
So you are, when you look in the mirror, you are not seeing what your face looks like.

479
01:48:44,569 --> 01:48:58,199
That's always why if you look at a picture of yourself and you're like, wait, what's wrong with

480
01:48:58,199 --> 01:49:10,550
my face? Chad is throwing right now. Yeah. What are you guys doing? Are you guys throwing on

481
01:49:10,550 --> 01:49:20,539
purpose? What are you guys even selecting here? No, no. Why'd you get the axe? Why did you pick

482
01:49:20,539 --> 01:49:30,119
the axe? What is going on with this build? It was going so well until like 30 seconds ago.

483
01:49:31,930 --> 01:49:40,489
What happened? It's definitely because there's too many happening in a row and everyone that's

484
01:49:40,489 --> 01:49:47,609
like, everyone that's from, okay, to all the EU viewers, you are voting for stuff that probably

485
01:49:47,609 --> 01:50:10,140
happened 10 seconds ago. The EU viewers get the short end of the stick again. There's a 30 second

486
01:50:10,140 --> 01:50:18,949
delay. So there's a, I have low latency mode on. So there's probably like a four, three to five

487
01:50:18,949 --> 01:50:23,590
second delay. Yeah. So hold on a minute. I don't think anybody's voting for the right thing.

488
01:50:25,050 --> 01:50:30,260
There's a three to five second delay with low latency. Also you have a delay to me

489
01:50:31,479 --> 01:50:36,760
watching through the Twitch server. So it has to compress through and the bit rate has to

490
01:50:36,760 --> 01:50:42,039
send it to you. So it's probably 10 plus seconds. So you guys are just pressing random numbers. I

491
01:50:42,039 --> 01:51:00,260
think at this point it's working pretty well. My delay says 0.75 seconds, but might be one of my

492
01:51:00,260 --> 01:51:34,180
neighbors. 0.75. That's no way. I mean, that person, that person's like on the Las Vegas

493
01:51:34,180 --> 01:51:57,000
script right now. Just like watching. No, that would, no, not even 0.75 seconds means you are

494
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:28,739
like in the house. My delay is three seconds. Well, okay. So one second, correct me if I'm

495
01:52:28,739 --> 01:52:36,100
wrong. Cause I, I mean, I know a little bit about networking, right? 1000 ping means one full second

496
01:52:36,100 --> 01:52:44,250
delay, correct? Thanks for ruining the whole game by the way. Can't wait. Maybe not. That's correct.

497
01:52:46,489 --> 01:52:58,779
1000 ping means one second is how long it takes to go from the server to you guys. My bit rate

498
01:52:58,779 --> 01:53:05,180
sucks right now. I don't know what the hell yours looks like. Like my game's bit rate is actually

499
01:53:05,180 --> 01:53:44,939
bad right now. I don't know what it could possibly be for you. How long does the panic thing last?

500
01:53:44,939 --> 01:53:54,199
This feels like it's been a long time. All right, now I'm going to go start picking up everything.

501
01:53:55,079 --> 01:54:15,989
Dude, forget about like, oh, if we went back in time and showed a caveman this, what would they say?

502
01:54:15,989 --> 01:54:24,340
If you went back like 15 years or 20 years and showed a person this, they'd be like, what the

503
01:54:24,340 --> 01:54:32,359
fuck is going on and why? What is that? I don't think you have to go back that far. Go back to like

504
01:54:32,359 --> 01:54:37,399
the early 2000s or like if people would be like, what are you, what's happening to you?

505
01:54:37,399 --> 01:55:01,420
What's going on? Can you explain this to me? That's wicked funny. Somebody said this looks

506
01:55:01,420 --> 01:55:06,140
like a bath bomb. Wow. That's best chat of the best chatter of the entire evening.

507
01:55:09,109 --> 01:55:16,380
It looks like a bath bomb. Dude, I can't move because of the panic.

508
01:55:17,180 --> 01:55:29,960
Is that what it looks like? All right, hold on. Open the chest. I got it. It's this. Oh, yes. It's

509
01:55:29,960 --> 01:56:05,800
the side. My favorite. It's fucked up. All right. You have to vote for three, vote for three. So we

510
01:56:05,800 --> 01:56:17,380
don't have to keep doing this. Vote for three. All right. Bring it on. Give me everything. Give me

511
01:56:17,380 --> 01:56:22,979
all you got. I'm talking jelly walls. I'm talking swarms. I'm talking monsters. I'm talking fast

512
01:56:22,979 --> 01:56:36,920
extra speed for all monsters. Give me, give me everything you got. All right. There's a,

513
01:56:36,920 --> 01:57:19,260
there's an orb right over here. I'm going to get it. A fucking bath bomb. Up. Oh, here we go.

514
01:57:19,260 --> 01:57:30,069
I didn't do anything. Oh, yeah, I did. It was traveling. How many times do I level up? I leveled

515
01:57:30,069 --> 01:57:44,789
up like 15 times. All right. If you did go back to like back in like the fucking 1500s and you had,

516
01:57:45,510 --> 01:57:48,710
you know, you were surrounded by, you know, people with like muskets

517
01:57:49,670 --> 01:57:54,069
and they saw this and you had to explain this to them or you were dead. You know what I mean?

518
01:57:54,069 --> 01:57:58,779
Like you were a fucking warlock. What would you do? Like if you were to explain what's going on

519
01:57:58,779 --> 01:58:13,239
right now? What is this? You have 10 seconds. What would you do? Be like, um, what would you say?

520
01:58:14,760 --> 01:58:21,430
Would you blame it on like the devil or something? I think I would be on their side. I'd be like,

521
01:58:21,430 --> 01:58:25,670
I have no idea. You have no idea. I don't know what that is either. It's the devil's work. We

522
01:58:25,670 --> 01:58:29,029
must get rid of it. Right. Cause you, there's no way you're going to, it's not going to happen.

523
01:58:29,029 --> 01:58:36,409
There's no way you have to like be on their team. Yeah. I don't know what that is,

524
01:58:36,409 --> 01:58:58,119
but it needs to be banished and cast from our village. Oh, I finally got it. Say God made it.

525
01:58:58,119 --> 01:59:04,039
No, no, I don't think so. No, I'm not saying that. Uh, the citizens would start to like recreate

526
01:59:04,039 --> 01:59:14,619
this stuff. They would try to like make this real. Uh-uh. Like they would think this is, oh,

527
01:59:14,619 --> 01:59:20,680
oh, we needed to make giant sides. That's what he wants. He wants us to make giant sides and

528
01:59:21,399 --> 01:59:35,770
throw flowers at each other. Society would crumble. All right. How does my face look right now?

529
01:59:35,770 --> 01:59:41,619
Should I go with some, how do you explain electricity? You don't. That's why I would

530
01:59:41,619 --> 01:59:47,479
just be, you would just be on their team. You would just be like, I don't know. Where did you

531
01:59:47,479 --> 01:59:53,770
come from? The woods. I've been in the woods. Yeah. I'll be in the woods this whole time. I've been in

532
01:59:53,770 --> 02:00:03,770
the woods. Who's your parents? They died in the great battle that we had. All right. That checks

533
02:00:03,770 --> 02:00:38,739
out was this one. Uh, oh yeah. Crits. How old are you? Uh, uh, uh, I don't know. 15. Oh, okay.

534
02:00:39,300 --> 02:00:46,520
It's like, I don't know how long people live, right? I don't think people look like if I said

535
02:00:46,520 --> 02:00:54,460
like 40, they'd be like, you mean 40, 40. What do you mean? How come you don't have gray hair?

536
02:00:54,460 --> 02:01:20,340
You're not old. No. Yes. Oh, uh, Brian Michael is, is, is 38. He looks like this old ass guy.

537
02:01:21,989 --> 02:01:52,729
It's not possible. Get rid of him. Kill him. All right. Um, so I'm just going to like stand here

538
02:01:53,449 --> 02:01:58,810
because I need to reply to, uh, somebody in my agency. We're going to talk about the incoming,

539
02:01:58,810 --> 02:02:03,529
the sponsor stuff for a second. So, um, I think I'm all right. I'm just going to take a second here.

540
02:02:36,600 --> 02:02:44,699
What is, um, look at how, do you see how I'm, my game is running slow. Why am I going so slow?

541
02:02:46,539 --> 02:03:04,420
Dude, it's actually, it's not, it's, it's slow motion. There's too many cats. Why am I? Look at

542
02:03:04,420 --> 02:03:19,100
how slow this is. Okay. This has to stop. I'm just waiting for my Jeep, like, like CPU fan to go.

543
02:03:19,100 --> 02:03:22,859
You know what I mean? You know, when you, you know, your computer is working real hard when

544
02:03:23,500 --> 02:03:24,939
all of a sudden you just start hearing,

545
02:03:31,350 --> 02:03:59,060
you're like, Oh, dude, you got to push the limits of the 30 90s. Somebody just asked me to go get

546
02:03:59,060 --> 02:04:06,779
the armor up here. And it's like, I mean, I don't think I really need it. Can you even die? I don't

547
02:04:06,779 --> 02:04:11,619
think so. I actually want to try to get to a hundred. So I'm just gonna stick around here.

548
02:04:11,619 --> 02:04:53,720
I don't even need it. 104. What's the highest I think I've ever been. I'll be like close to here.

549
02:04:53,720 --> 02:05:18,489
One five, one on 10. This is, this is definitely the most ridiculous, uh, like character I think

550
02:05:18,489 --> 02:06:03,189
I've ever seen. Probably could have been crazier too. Okay. Give me the ultra wave. This five more

551
02:06:03,189 --> 02:06:37,800
minutes. I got, I'm going to get to like 130. I'm going to get to like 150. Holy shit. My God.

552
02:07:14,119 --> 02:07:20,010
Hey, I just realized that this is going to take 10 minutes because it's at like half speed.

553
02:07:20,090 --> 02:07:29,659
It's counting at half speed, 30, 31, 32. It's almost three seconds for every one second.

554
02:07:29,659 --> 02:07:36,060
This is going to take 15 minutes. This is going to be insane. It's at like 0.2 speed. So it's

555
02:07:36,060 --> 02:08:08,729
count. Yeah. It's gonna be like 12 minutes. You're in slow mo as well. I am not. This is what Adderall

556
02:08:08,729 --> 02:08:44,680
is doing to your brain. What dude, this shit is flavor blasted. You guys are on point today.

557
02:08:44,680 --> 02:09:10,380
Really? You guys are on point this afternoon. 119. This is the highest I've ever been for sure.

558
02:09:11,020 --> 02:09:35,779
There's still so much time left. I might get to 150 to be absurd. 17,000 gold too.

559
02:09:35,779 --> 02:09:50,710
All right. I'm going to try to go this way to collect everything that died over here. Oh,

560
02:09:50,710 --> 02:10:02,970
I picked up a, I picked up one of those things. Didn't I? Yep. The kind of stuff that they,

561
02:10:03,609 --> 02:10:16,220
it's the kind of stuff they market to babies. Do we need, we need some like,

562
02:10:17,829 --> 02:10:21,909
we need, we need the Muppets back. You know what I mean? Where are the fuck, where are the Muppets?

563
02:10:22,970 --> 02:10:36,939
Where are the Muppets? We need, we need the Muppets. We need them back. Dude, this

564
02:10:38,859 --> 02:11:06,789
Muppets level threat, but it is though you're, it is I'm at one, two, three. Should I just quit

565
02:11:06,789 --> 02:11:21,319
the game right now? Four more minutes. Resident sleeper. I'm really sorry to that person, but

566
02:11:21,319 --> 02:11:31,270
it's probably like seven or eight more minutes. This seems to be counting at two. It's like two

567
02:11:31,270 --> 02:11:47,479
and a half seconds for every one second. Sometimes a little longer. Somebody just came in here and

568
02:11:47,479 --> 02:11:56,699
said, what the fuck am I looking at? Um, demonic power. I agree. We should get rid of this. We

569
02:11:56,699 --> 02:12:03,720
should, we should banish this. I'm on your side. I don't know what this is. It appeared in my,

570
02:12:03,720 --> 02:12:12,069
it appeared next to my outhouse. Showed up in a portal that came from hell. And you know,

571
02:12:13,029 --> 02:12:23,659
hold on. I just, I just saw a bunch of new enemies and I was like, wait, I have to pay attention.

572
02:12:36,869 --> 02:12:41,270
You're from some crazy time in the future. What is happening? What are we looking at?

573
02:12:42,069 --> 02:12:46,869
You could also become like wicked cool. Oh, well, this is what you're watching. It is the great war,

574
02:12:47,670 --> 02:12:53,739
the great war of humanity. Explain to them that this is all, like all of this really happened.

575
02:13:03,989 --> 02:13:27,029
What a ramble stream. They'd be like, it was me. I did this. Then point, point to somebody.

576
02:13:27,109 --> 02:13:35,979
Oh, I want to be the first person to get their milk delivered forever. Okay. Okay.

577
02:13:36,859 --> 02:13:55,350
This game is hurting my head. Um, I think it's hurting everybody's head right now.

578
02:13:55,350 --> 02:14:10,869
Who delivers milk? Um, I don't know all the back in like the fucking 13, 1400s.

579
02:14:11,750 --> 02:14:16,340
It was not, there was no grocery store back in like the 1400s.

580
02:14:17,220 --> 02:14:25,430
It was like a butcher. It was a milkman. Okay. I think I gotta go forward a little bit. I gotta

581
02:14:25,430 --> 02:14:41,100
go forward a little bit because the milkman was not back in like 1300s. It was like in the 20s.

582
02:14:47,689 --> 02:14:59,159
The milkman drove a truck. Okay. Okay. If in the 1400s, there was a milkman that got teleported

583
02:14:59,159 --> 02:15:04,439
back in the milkman uniform with milk in a thing and had the milkman truck, would he also be like

584
02:15:04,439 --> 02:15:09,399
killed and banished? Would they, you know, like the, like I'm delivering the milk today. Like,

585
02:15:09,399 --> 02:15:13,319
hello, good morning, Mrs. Stevenson. Like would they get, would that guy be like scary?

586
02:15:14,039 --> 02:15:36,970
I want level 134. They would a hundred percent kill him. Oh, good day. How are you? Oh, Mrs.

587
02:15:36,970 --> 02:15:43,020
Stevenson. Here it is. Fresh milk. Get him. Like what would they, I feel like they, I don't think

588
02:15:43,020 --> 02:15:53,189
they would. It was like dancing around and like moving, moving his arms, like really happily.

589
02:15:54,149 --> 02:16:16,119
How many times can I revive? Clown, not a milkman. He's different. Get him. He's different.

590
02:16:16,920 --> 02:16:27,350
Hello, Mrs. Stevenson. How are you? Oh, yep. Fresh milk. Get him. He's,

591
02:16:28,310 --> 02:16:49,219
this thing, they grab him. We need muffins. All right. I locked some stuff, but that's enough.

592
02:16:49,219 --> 02:17:05,370
The third coming of Jesus. It's a milkman. The 1500s needed the muffins. Those muffins

593
02:17:05,690 --> 02:17:17,579
would have been disposed of quicker than you could have blinked your eyes. If they, if Kermit the

594
02:17:17,579 --> 02:17:30,860
Frog was playing the banjo on a rock, like throw a fucking javelin at him. You know what I mean?

595
02:17:30,860 --> 02:17:35,270
They would, I don't think that back in like the 1400s, 1300s, I don't think so. Wait,

596
02:17:35,270 --> 02:17:39,670
they did puppet shows, didn't they? There were puppets. They did like shows and plays. Yes,

597
02:17:39,670 --> 02:17:45,860
they would. That would be fine. That would be fine. They did like plays and shows and stuff.

598
02:17:45,860 --> 02:17:54,120
Theater. Why would they go after, why would they do that? How far back do you have to go before,

599
02:17:54,840 --> 02:18:01,610
okay, how far back do you have to go before Kermit the Frog playing a banjo on a rock would be like

600
02:18:01,610 --> 02:18:07,139
terrifying and like, oh my God, what is going on over there? You have to go to 200 BC?

601
02:18:17,370 --> 02:18:28,739
You'd have to go like back 2000 years ago? I don't think, I think it's a little further. I

602
02:18:28,739 --> 02:18:35,739
think the cavemen, the cavemen would be scared of anything. But what was right after cavemen?

603
02:18:35,739 --> 02:18:40,379
They had frogs back then, but they didn't have like muppets and puppets and like, oh hey, it's me.

604
02:18:40,379 --> 02:18:46,600
They didn't do that. Ancient Greece had shadow puppets. They would do puppets. What about before

605
02:18:46,600 --> 02:19:01,819
ancient Greece? When would a javelin get thrown at Kermit, like a puppet? I don't know why I care

606
02:19:01,819 --> 02:19:05,979
about this. All right, I'll be right back. We're gonna, we gotta get this out of our system.

607
02:19:05,979 --> 02:19:22,729
It would have to have been tens of thousands of years ago. Puppets are older than javelins, dude.

608
02:19:22,729 --> 02:19:28,540
Well, like a bug of rock, like a huge boulder, like somebody would run over and just smash one

609
02:19:28,540 --> 02:19:42,069
of the puppet's heads. I guess you'd have to go, yeah, yeah, it'd have to be like 200 BC or something.

610
02:19:42,069 --> 02:19:48,379
But do, all right, hold on though. Wait, this is important. Do you guys don't think that a caveman

611
02:19:48,379 --> 02:19:54,780
one day would be funny, like jokey and be like, and they would all be around the campfire like,

612
02:19:55,659 --> 02:20:01,540
yes. I think that would be, I think that would probably happen. Like this is supposed to be you.

613
02:20:06,979 --> 02:20:15,860
And the two of them were like, that definitely happened. I think that, I think it would be fine.

614
02:20:15,860 --> 02:20:19,829
Who cares? All right, I'll be back in like two minutes. Gotham Knights coming up.

615
02:20:19,829 --> 02:20:26,780
I'm gonna play a different character this time. After Gotham Knights, we're gonna do the deadly

616
02:20:26,780 --> 02:20:29,850
night game. It's gonna be scary. I'll be right back.
