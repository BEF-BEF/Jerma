33
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:43,330
to see you cry on stream it's a real tearjerker yeah but every time we've ever seen a movie

34
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:48,939
together it doesn't matter what it is I cry at like every other scene sir say it's like monster

35
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:54,479
rancher with better combat is that a selling point have you played monster rancher I used to

36
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:59,360
play a ton of it okay I was gonna I was gonna reverse recommend you monster rancher if you

37
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,449
never played it no when I was a wee lad when like monster rancher 2 was new I remember going around

38
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:09,490
the house and like finding all the aol discs to try and get a good a good monster a good mon

39
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:15,650
but it's always the wolf yeah that that first scene and up I have to take a day off before

40
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:19,649
I come back to the movie I cry for about six hours and then the next day I can watch the

41
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:24,879
rest of the movie and I make sure that I don't watch that part I watch it from that part forward

42
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:30,420
okay so like close your eyes for like some parts of jade cocoon okay and like don't listen to the

43
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:40,029
soundtrack because it's like good and you'll like cry okay so you've done the tutorial yeah I

44
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:43,629
it seems like it's pretty easy to get in a game you just do like a join code and a password with

45
00:04:43,629 --> 00:04:52,269
a private match and I I did kind of speed run the tutorial but it did take me about five minutes

46
00:04:52,269 --> 00:05:01,519
and some change okay I'm very quick I'm gonna I'm gonna zoom yeah if I did it in five minutes

47
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:13,699
you could probably do it in three remember why do you sound like you're acting isn't he always

48
00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:21,709
dude why do you sound like you're acting again what do you mean oh I have to say again no it's

49
00:05:21,709 --> 00:05:26,670
the intro sir do you still do the intro voice kind of even even though it's been like more

50
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:34,370
than a decade the intro what is going on guys hey guys grimro here with another farming strategy

51
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:40,050

52
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:45,579

53
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:50,060
my stream very often it's a hard question to answer yeah but then you like kind of get over

54
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:55,519
it after like five minutes it's like okay this stream just turned on all right are you nervous

55
00:05:55,519 --> 00:06:00,750
are you nervous right now I mean I didn't mean this legendary star is the call with me

56
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:11,089
you mean come on I didn't pay attention to hold on okay no I'm good I'm doing the tutorial it's

57
00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:21,779
you know they're like throwing puzzles at me it's so easy he's acting like he's not acting

58
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:35,620
time zones are wild hey stars do you know that there is a spot on earth where it is

59
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:42,110
over the course of three days there's there there's a time zone where there is like it could be

60
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:49,949
January 5th 6th and 7th because of how the time zone works that's kind of messed up yeah did you

61
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:56,220
know that I I mean I didn't know that I did so I mean that was that's something that you know that

62
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:12,750
I did not know some knowledge to drop on you everyone's yelling at me you know oh you're not

63
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:28,939
smart I never said I was smart I just said I was dropping knowledge doesn't smart imply that I kind

64
00:07:28,939 --> 00:07:35,230
of came up with that concept I watched somebody talk about it and then I did I forwarded the email

65
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:52,339
to stir is knowledge smartness I mean I guess it is yeah being able to deduce things I think I have

66
00:07:52,339 --> 00:08:00,240
I have a general feeling that I'm going to be very bad at this game why because I'm in the tutorial

67
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:10,339
and I'm like really confused wait how the confusion per minute is too high for a tutorial

68
00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:14,670
how wait you can no you're not confused about this you just have to like

69
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:19,069
break windows and put out the fires and run through the and turn off the electrical outlets

70
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:25,949
I've never been in a fire before when he said is knowledge smartness omega low

71
00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:44,610

146
00:19:36,029 --> 00:19:43,900
is there anything else upstairs that's valuable I haven't I haven't been upstairs I'll be break this

147
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:54,779
where you at just let's take let's get the fridge and I know I can't pick the fridge up

150
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:18,690
yeah okay right here so get stuff over here and then we'll throw it out the window this way

151
00:20:19,329 --> 00:20:27,099
so find everything valuable and throw it out the window uh are the random things actually worth

152
00:20:27,099 --> 00:20:34,380
money yeah I have 14.99 yeah like vases I found like an actual stack of money I thought that was

153
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:51,890

another one easy access leaders grab all their shit snatch and grab they have like a dish we're

157
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:28,430

158
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:34,430
box make sure you save it that's why I love that one well inside that box is the family tree

160
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:55,950
actually this was a washing machine can we both pick it up I can't get it maybe you need like

equipment to pick up heavy stuff or something oh these explosive barrels are worth 30 bucks

162
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:12,819

163
00:22:12,819 --> 00:22:24,990
two people I think we rescued one person what is this oh all right we should probably end it

164
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:33,140
can we just end it yeah let's go I like the mix of is this not where we go I don't know over here

165
00:22:35,259 --> 00:22:43,009
I like the mix of being a firefighter and also like a criminal three stars that's not bad yes

166
00:22:43,009 --> 00:22:53,700
that's pretty good so how much was the bonus cash for who knows job payout nine that's pretty good

253
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:47,070
a little harder it's a big hotel construction shot it's right and it's it's it's like a medium

254
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:57,280
rare this is a medium rare mission I think we need to this mission we need to spend some time

what mine is too bad you couldn't get us all I know what you're doing you're just you're

257
00:38:18,019 --> 00:38:23,460
fucking up the whole the stocks and that's funny but like that's that's negatively impacting my

258
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:29,380
stream there there is a deployable toilet which will make the people who have to pee

259
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:36,380
go to that toilet so you could put it outside and they'll come to the toilet we cannot use

260
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:44,750
light firefighters might have 85 percent of the North American market but you best not

grease fire you got us killed man how would I'm supposed to differentiate and other people it's

290
00:44:34,289 --> 00:44:40,369
it's a cartoon game where you spray a bunch of shit oh you you should have known it was a grease

296
00:45:22,659 --> 00:45:34,539
I have a different loadout that's my class okay oh I have um as an axe and a trampoline that

297
00:45:34,539 --> 00:45:53,659
doesn't bounce what are the games do we have on on co-op sunday uh is is that a like announcement

298
00:45:53,659 --> 00:46:01,199
that you're not having fun uh because when I asked you to play this game and you were immediately

299
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:07,679
like okay what other games like before we had even played one round of this he was like oh

300
00:46:07,679 --> 00:46:14,690
maybe some other games we can like play a lot like on the same day no I'm just saying like what else

301
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:20,449
what else did you have do you have anything else in mind I linked you played up which seemed like

302
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:26,130
a funner version of the cook whatever the normal cookie game is

303
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:28,929

305
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:52,380

306
00:46:53,659 --> 00:46:59,579
I'm just making the argument that you know you and I don't get together that often right like

307
00:46:59,579 --> 00:47:03,500
sometimes we do and there's like other speed run games there's like others like other things we

308
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:08,139

333
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:50,559
I'm gonna we're not on bad time here we're doing fine we also do need to like I believe you can

334
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:56,289
you know put out the fire and the timer won't go down as fast we've kind of just been letting

335
00:50:57,090 --> 00:51:17,340
everything burn oh shit that is what's going on okay like the support beams of the house start

336
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:26,960
falling down right here you you handled I'm going just to be on fire duty I'm gonna try and get to

338
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:06,960
you throw someone off the roof yeah the trampoline down here dude where did he go

339
00:52:07,519 --> 00:52:31,309
you fell I think there's still a lot though there's one more guy I got a murder all right

340
00:52:31,309 --> 00:52:44,699
then we have to find how to get out of here it's it's on the street you got him okay where's it

341
00:52:46,739 --> 00:52:55,679
uh front of the house in the street we gotta leave like right now I'm hitting these boxes

342
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:59,679
why are you doing that we have to leave right now we have to leave right now because sometimes

343
00:52:59,679 --> 00:53:11,780
there's money in them we have to leave right now let's go I'm taking this chair oh they're

344
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:26,820
gonna lower our rating why do you have evil spider-man here today 500 bucks yeah I feel

345
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:37,340
like a house like that we do not have the proper equipment we are understaffed underfunded

346
00:53:38,139 --> 00:53:45,070
we got another one you want to do more how you doing are you not having any fun do you want to

347
00:53:45,070 --> 00:53:52,829
know I swear to god I'm having fun I'm enjoying this game I just don't want it to be like a

348
00:53:52,829 --> 00:53:56,510
wilderness situation where you mess with me afterwards and you're like this is the worst

349
00:53:56,510 --> 00:54:03,780
experience I've ever had do not recommend a game to me ever again that didn't happen

350
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:12,420
wonder demolition burn the house down and clear out all the barrels was good I bought a breach

351
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:30,940
charge hold up I'll put words in my mouth that I didn't say well all right I'm ready I think we

352
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:44,030
just have to uh stand in the thing these are Incredibles cars what's that mean we could try

353
00:54:44,030 --> 00:55:05,179
dota all right burn the house down there's a bunch of propane tanks here there's a there's a grease

354
00:55:05,179 --> 00:55:11,179
fire already I'm just gonna throw some some shit in it oh it's a toxic sludge here hold on I got

355
00:55:11,179 --> 00:55:40,800
this apparently I don't got this blow up did you not shoot it I got it just go grab the propane

356
00:55:40,800 --> 00:56:07,250
tanks outside there's like three fires not spreading I think there's like a torch or something

357
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:15,920
out there I saw it was like a fire thing well then if you're seeing all these things what are

358
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:34,210
you doing what I'm just I'm spreading the fire are you putting it out what the heck does this work

359
00:56:41,170 --> 00:57:01,980
what does this thing do maybe we have to like smash something how many things did you throw in

360
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:07,900
here because the fire is like a tiny little thing in the corner I threw like two or three propanes

361
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:14,429
in there there's also a roof I'm on the roof right now oh you're on the roof yeah I'll come

362
00:57:14,429 --> 00:57:31,949
up there in a sec I'm throwing a propane in here okay I'm not happy with the trampoline

363
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:55,389
state in this world where are you upstairs yeah yeah it's like why are you not having fun

364
00:57:55,949 --> 00:58:03,199
I am I'm blowing stuff up okay I was just muted talking to chat for a second I had a

365
00:58:04,239 --> 00:58:13,280
subs came in tonight what are you telling them that you're not telling me no I'm just they would

366
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:17,440
they were giving suggestions for games and I'm just like I don't want to I was essentially

367
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:47,409
reprimanding them where are you I'm on the roof because apparently there's one more okay we got

368
00:58:47,409 --> 00:59:21,199
all the toxic barrels we got to burn the building we almost got this almost what all right we did it

369
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:32,960
it would do all we did it nice got it that was interesting it's like a you it's like a reverse

370
00:59:37,469 --> 00:59:54,130
yeah that's like a reverse we only have one second to do that close uh yeah I was putting out every

371
00:59:54,130 --> 01:00:01,650
single thing you were doing by the way I was fighting so hard to put to like to fix everything

372
01:00:01,650 --> 01:00:10,099
that you were doing you're you're doing you're being me we cut it out we flipped I think we

373
01:00:10,099 --> 01:00:19,380
flipped here I picked a game that normally you would play and you're being me all right let's

374
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:24,099
actually do this one this one seems pretty hard this is like a barrel factory let's do it

375
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:28,739
all right this game's I'm not I promise I'm having a good time I'm just messing around

376
01:00:28,739 --> 01:00:49,340
you played the uno reverse card um I'm on edge dude I'm on edge oh it's an escape mission

377
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:55,179
I don't like these oh hello again we got your personal information off the ember database

378
01:00:55,179 --> 01:00:59,340
it was pretty easy to hack into you've been making quite the kerfuffle for us

379
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:03,980
of the closer headquarters we had our government buy out this oil barrel factory

380
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:08,219
when we get you out of our toks we're gonna use this place to store 100%

381
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:20,159
during those classic videos now just stir is bad you're mad oh fuck all right how do we actually

382
01:01:20,159 --> 01:01:25,730
get out of here wait what are we doing we have to we have to just get out I'd much prefer to have

383
01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:30,050
you work at closer than go through all this trouble careful what your non-compete clause clearly

384
01:01:30,050 --> 01:01:35,090
states ember responders are barred from working for any app-based firefighting companies or

385
01:01:35,090 --> 01:01:41,250
Canadian corporations yeah I still think that would be so fun and funny to do to do the social

386
01:01:41,250 --> 01:01:50,929
like the stir in germa video remastered series it it would we just we pick a video and we just

387
01:01:50,929 --> 01:01:56,530
try to redo the whole video but like without watching it and then one of us makes the video

388
01:01:56,530 --> 01:02:01,489
when we premiere and we watch it on screen and like how close did we come to the original

389
01:02:02,289 --> 01:02:11,940
what was the name of that game that we were gonna do I think it was damn nation yeah I don't know

390
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:14,820
that game probably isn't even the server is probably I don't know if you can even play that

391
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:20,019
anymore to operate here instead of ember well why not our socialized after a long time 15

392
01:02:20,099 --> 01:02:24,739
Canadian dollar per hour minimum wage and free K through 12 schooling for your kids

393
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:30,190
how do we wait I think we gotta get these gases sucked up into the fans

394
01:02:30,989 --> 01:02:40,289
okay it looks like we gotta turn are you so resistant to I just walked in November we just

395
01:02:40,289 --> 01:02:45,090
want to do our solemn duty to just walk through it the United States as is written in the great

396
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:57,489
Canadian constitution whoa I just mushed hey dude uh don't press that button though I'm like

397
01:02:57,489 --> 01:03:04,380
investigating there's they won't connect anything won't the thing needed to be there

398
01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:12,780
oh you goofed up your own goof and you're still going to commit to the goof

399
01:03:18,510 --> 01:03:25,230
you actually vanished I'm I am gone yet you got turned into pace okay cool now like now like star

400
01:03:25,230 --> 01:03:40,780
gets to be the one who like does the whole game that's cool if you just want to like sit back

401
01:03:41,659 --> 01:03:54,320
and uh why can I not spectate you dude just say you don't want to play I'm

402
01:03:58,210 --> 01:04:08,349
that's not what's happening we can all breathe the situation man

403
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:12,260
I don't know what I'm doing I am I am a puzzle brainlet

404
01:04:13,139 --> 01:04:31,579

405
01:04:31,579 --> 01:04:45,579
open I hey dude maybe I can suck it up through the air vent oh oh I got it I got it we have we

406
01:04:45,579 --> 01:04:52,059

407
01:04:52,059 --> 01:05:00,099
you just did I'm like I'm jerma I'm throwing barrels at you I'm like putting objects in

409
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:17,360
fucking serious it's interesting I wonder how did why did we flip we just needed a change

410
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:22,320
you'll never get past our shipping pallets they're going way too fast to just jump across

411
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:27,360
by the way these will be shipped right out to our leak like what are you what is on your screen

412
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:36,769
right now I'm in the first area where we spawned just looking at stuff you guys did a soul swap

413
01:05:38,139 --> 01:05:46,639
I think I'm at the exit but you're dead we did a freaky Friday I think I'm at the exit but it

414
01:05:46,639 --> 01:05:54,690
won't let me leave because you're dead I'm not sure uh you probably have to come and get me

415
01:05:55,570 --> 01:06:09,099
where are you at the the spawn of the level ah man it is it is a chore playing games with stir

416
01:06:13,179 --> 01:06:20,820

520
01:29:00,500 --> 01:29:20,819
helpful I'm ready when you are dead so what's your uh what's your game of the year for 2023 so far

521
01:29:20,819 --> 01:29:29,020
vampire survivors I came out last year oh oh I misunderstood the question um I haven't played

522
01:29:29,020 --> 01:29:33,630
anything this year you actually want to do the thing from last year so what was your game of

523
01:29:33,630 --> 01:29:42,750
the year from last year um shoot I wrote something on on the twitter I forget I have like a I really

524
01:29:42,750 --> 01:29:49,710
like a brain problem slice and dice you played slice and dice slice and dice yeah is that a

525
01:29:50,350 --> 01:29:53,949
I think I've heard of it I think I was gonna play it eventually is that the a game that's on um

526
01:29:54,670 --> 01:30:02,539
is that itch yo yeah yep and I think it's on like android I actually have had that since

527
01:30:03,260 --> 01:30:12,659
that itch yo night from like a year ago it's very good but you have to like think so I don't know

528
01:30:12,659 --> 01:30:25,100
if you'd be into it I mean I did you like vampire survivors I okay this is a very stir story so I uh

529
01:30:26,060 --> 01:30:30,300
I I don't I got vampire survivors like this is kind of cool but I feel like the whole thing is

530
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:36,079
just like you don't actually do anything you can just stand still kind of that's so I got cheat

531
01:30:36,079 --> 01:30:40,560
engine to give me all of the unlocks and then I did a run and then I stood still and realized

532
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:45,949
that you could beat it while standing still and was like okay I think I'm done wait hold on a

533
01:30:45,949 --> 01:30:53,229
minute you we're not playing the mission yet because I'm gonna okay but but but but but but

534
01:30:53,229 --> 01:30:57,069
have you played like any of the others like soul stone survivors you like you actually like move

535
01:30:57,069 --> 01:31:06,270
in that game and dodge attacks you have this so wrong you cheated after the first time you played

536
01:31:06,270 --> 01:31:12,750
it you're supposed to unlock stuff and slowly get more and more powerful the whole game is just like

537
01:31:12,750 --> 01:31:16,909
like there's no skill expression you know what I'm saying like you don't get to just like

538
01:31:18,609 --> 01:31:22,770
if what you do doesn't matter if you have the upgrades then it's not exciting to me because

539
01:31:22,770 --> 01:31:28,210
you're just you're not doing anything like you you are gated by what the game has given you like

540
01:31:28,210 --> 01:31:34,880
you're predetermined to have lost it's like you're playing the binding of Isaac but your tears don't

541
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:39,600
do damage but if you don't like I hate it Hades dude everyone in chat's gonna think I'm crazy

542
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:45,520
but Hades was just like if you want to deal plus 300% you're unmuted aren't I no no I'm

543
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:51,199
just letting you go if you want to deal 300% more damage then you have to die x amount of times

544
01:31:52,579 --> 01:31:58,979
so you want the game to just when you turn it on just to go like I like just give you everything

545
01:31:58,979 --> 01:32:05,140
no I like roguelikes where it's not about how much stuff you have unlocked it's about

546
01:32:05,220 --> 01:32:12,529
how well you're playing yeah you can I correct me if I'm wrong here but I think you could beat

547
01:32:12,529 --> 01:32:19,470
Hades on your first try if you were good enough do it then it's the same the same thing people

548
01:32:19,470 --> 01:32:24,829
told me about loop hero oh yo the speed runners beat loop hero on their second run when they know

549
01:32:24,829 --> 01:32:29,310
all of the optimal strats and have been playing the game for hundreds of hours so like it's not

550
01:32:29,310 --> 01:32:34,670
it's not about hours of progression that they force you to do because you could beat it in four

551
01:32:34,670 --> 01:32:40,189
hours if you actually like did like the reddit strategy stir people are dying in this building

552
01:32:40,829 --> 01:32:45,229
you're the one that said let's take a minute and talk about this like you're in like a burning

553
01:32:45,229 --> 01:32:49,869
building there's people arguing about vampire survivor the firefighters are arguing about

554
01:32:49,869 --> 01:32:55,710
roguelikes in the have you played rotato I have it's like the same thing as vampire survivors

555
01:32:57,229 --> 01:33:01,229
but like like like you actually get to dodge abilities and it's like quicker I like that a

556
01:33:01,229 --> 01:33:12,579
lot more explosion um so you don't like when a game trickles you content after playing it for

557
01:33:12,579 --> 01:33:20,100
a while I don't like when your chance of success is gated by how much time you've played and solely

558
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:26,319
how much time you've played well I mean what that so but you probably feel the same way about an

559
01:33:26,319 --> 01:33:30,399
mmo then like mmos you got to play a lot to get anything from it would you ever play like an

560
01:33:30,479 --> 01:33:35,359
I mean I don't really like mmos you know you know I play like path of exile in diablo like I like

561
01:33:35,359 --> 01:33:41,119
grinding games right so what about diablo in diablo you start as a little shitty and you

562
01:33:41,119 --> 01:33:46,159
give you a stick and it takes you hours and hours to level up and put skill points in

563
01:33:47,199 --> 01:33:51,279
but you're still like doing an individual character build and it's like your journey

564
01:33:51,279 --> 01:33:57,359
through and what items you find vampire survivors is there is you will eventually have 100 of these

565
01:33:57,359 --> 01:34:04,930
things you know you can't equip every single item in all of diablo 2 all at once and be like

566
01:34:04,930 --> 01:34:11,170
okay I wouldn't know the fun of vampire survivors is why you kind of roll dice to see what the game

567
01:34:11,170 --> 01:34:17,970
is gonna let you choose from really oh really that's what it does it's like oh what am I gonna it's

568
01:34:17,970 --> 01:34:24,210
an open box it's like what am I gonna get but then you unlock like rerolls yeah you get to choose

569
01:34:24,210 --> 01:34:28,689
exactly the same things that you want every single run I am not going to tell you that there's no

570
01:34:28,689 --> 01:34:35,810
power creep in vampire survivors there is I'm but I it's it's all right dollars I like it

571
01:34:37,180 --> 01:34:41,420
but I think there's better alternatives at this point for it to be your game of the year is

572
01:34:41,420 --> 01:34:46,220
is honestly name me something better start up what else I said bro I think bro tato is very similar

573
01:34:47,340 --> 01:34:54,289
and I think it does it's it's better I don't think so what do you not like about bro tato I just

574
01:34:55,010 --> 01:34:58,930
I just like I like vampire survivors more I think vampire survivors

575
01:34:59,489 --> 01:35:04,609
has I like because abilities you like when you open the chest and it's like a casino and you

576
01:35:04,609 --> 01:35:12,449
can hear all the noises yeah you know what yeah I like the kind of hey the game is going to throw

577
01:35:12,449 --> 01:35:16,770
you some stuff what do you want to do and you got to make a decision and it gets stronger and

578
01:35:16,770 --> 01:35:23,810
stronger I know but like I don't I it's not the same it's not the same it's the loot box noises

579
01:35:23,810 --> 01:35:29,090
it's not the same there's something about this different I tried what was it soul survivors

580
01:35:29,090 --> 01:35:34,260
one of the soul stone survivors yeah survivors I think I streamed that game and I was just like

581
01:35:34,260 --> 01:35:41,229
it was like too it's it's like identical it was too much too quickly I don't like having all the

582
01:35:41,229 --> 01:35:46,430
extremely powerful unlockables immediately I like to grow in power they there's tons of stuff you

583
01:35:46,430 --> 01:35:55,810
can grow in power in that game it's too much it was too it's too much I honestly rare germa l rare

584
01:35:55,810 --> 01:36:04,640
stir l oh stir wins what you're gonna have to put up a poll who wins this argument who all right

585
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:09,600
put a poll on who's the winner who wins the argument here I'll do it what do you mean you

586
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:16,079
don't have mod in my channel why wouldn't I I don't why don't I have mod in your channel I

587
01:36:16,079 --> 01:36:26,100
removed like everybody okay what did I do what did I do that you were scared that like this

588
01:36:26,100 --> 01:36:32,020
fucking psycho if you like to start banning people that you don't trust me but I I D wanted

589
01:36:32,020 --> 01:36:40,000
like a dozen dozens of people and by the way you don't have VIP either I am aware that I see that

590
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:45,359
now you want to know what I do have I have a bit badge because uh you know I've given you some money

591
01:36:45,359 --> 01:36:54,079
on your channel hey dude this looks pretty close but I think uh 54 to 46 all right now do it on

592
01:36:54,079 --> 01:36:58,960
your channel and see if it's 54 46 in favorite view for streamer advantage someone actually did

593
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:10,399
do it on my channel I am at 78 78 yes yes yeah who wins stir 80 percent right now vampire survivors

594
01:37:10,399 --> 01:37:16,479
got really popular and then here come all the haters here they come oh it's too I don't like

595
01:37:16,479 --> 01:37:24,300
it I actually don't like it I hate it you just hate her I don't hate it I think there's better

596
01:37:24,300 --> 01:37:30,800
alternatives when you're saying it's your game of the year what else did I say was my game of

597
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:36,979
the year that's all you've said so far to me I don't know anything else we've talked about it

598
01:37:36,979 --> 01:37:46,739
before like in the chat I mean Elden Ring is Elden Ring oh no he chose vampire survivors over Elden

599
01:37:46,739 --> 01:37:53,939
Ring and God of War you play God of War no I didn't play God of War well you don't have to

600
01:37:53,939 --> 01:37:57,939
because vampire survivors was actually the best game last year Elden Ring was the best game that

601
01:37:57,939 --> 01:38:03,539
came out last year but vampire survivors was like different and like indie and you like that you

602
01:38:03,539 --> 01:38:09,220
like that stuff so I was like hey vampire survivors and then you just kind of you just like stomped

603
01:38:09,220 --> 01:38:13,460
all over my sandcastle I thought we were going to have an agreement a friend time and all of a

604
01:38:13,460 --> 01:38:21,460
sudden I'm wrong it's all progression no thought I need something I need something to interact

605
01:38:21,460 --> 01:38:26,800
with I need like a button I can press every once in a while yeah but isn't it fun just to kind of

606
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:34,880
sit on the toilet and just do that it's like awesome when I sit on the toilet I shit that's

607
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:42,850
all I do you ever just take a moment out of your life where you don't have to be like on a device

608
01:38:50,340 --> 01:38:54,420
wait you mean to tell me you just you go to the bathroom when you go to the bathroom what kind of

609
01:38:54,420 --> 01:38:58,819
weirdo is this Ashley's the same way she can't go to the bathroom unless she like has her phone

610
01:38:58,819 --> 01:39:05,060
and can read articles yeah because it's it's you know what it is dude if I could do that in the

611
01:39:05,060 --> 01:39:10,220
shower I would if I could have like a thing where I could just be in the shower and like playing

612
01:39:10,220 --> 01:39:14,140
like a game or something hanging out this reminds me of a story of someone who was a professional

613
01:39:14,140 --> 01:39:18,619
clash of clans addict and they were like had like 10 accounts and they would like zip lock their

614
01:39:18,619 --> 01:39:23,340
phone and play it in the shower you're so you're not on that level no because you could you could

615
01:39:23,340 --> 01:39:28,460
zip lock your your phone no but that's I don't know that's weird I don't like that material feels

616
01:39:28,460 --> 01:39:37,819
weird um okay the main problem is when you're that's like a very private enclosed space nobody

617
01:39:37,819 --> 01:39:43,899
else it's just you get to be in there and it's super it's just you and you're just hanging out

618
01:39:43,899 --> 01:39:49,420
in there and it's a super private little spot I it feels good to kind of like oh I'm in the bathroom

619
01:39:49,420 --> 01:39:52,779
just like taking it you know what I mean like there's a lot of that is that because if you

620
01:39:52,779 --> 01:39:57,260
weren't in the bathroom you would be like oh I need to be busy like I'm wasting time like I

621
01:39:57,260 --> 01:40:01,979
got to be productive but in the bathroom it's like no it's acceptable because I need to poop

622
01:40:01,979 --> 01:40:06,699
but you're taking extra time pooping you know playing vampire survivors when you could actually

623
01:40:06,699 --> 01:40:10,779
just like judge yourself a little less and like go do it out in nature like out in nature you know

624
01:40:10,779 --> 01:40:17,579
take a hike but when you are in the bathroom there are no worldly expectations of you like you said

625
01:40:17,579 --> 01:40:22,300
well that's what I'm saying you need to like that's that's an issue that's a problem even dude even

626
01:40:22,859 --> 01:40:28,220
even oh well what about like lying in bed dude you could be like you could be no there's like

627
01:40:28,220 --> 01:40:34,779
a worldly expectation the only worldly expectation you have when you are in the bathroom is nope

628
01:40:34,779 --> 01:40:39,420
private private this is you are you are shut off for at least however long you're in there

629
01:40:42,939 --> 01:40:48,510
this is what you guys are getting that's rough that's rough man like dude because like if your

630
01:40:48,510 --> 01:40:55,229
alarm goes off when you're asleep oh I gotta get up right there is no like your alarm doesn't go

631
01:40:55,229 --> 01:41:00,189
off like when you're in the bathroom it's not like oh shit I gotta get off the toilet now it's but

632
01:41:00,189 --> 01:41:04,989
yeah I gotta I got some I got some stuff no no you are in there what if you're late to go do

633
01:41:04,989 --> 01:41:08,750
something and you tell them like I was late because like I had to go to the bathroom is that like

634
01:41:08,750 --> 01:41:12,350
always acceptable if someone shows up or like doesn't give something to you on time and it's

635
01:41:12,350 --> 01:41:17,710
like I was in the bathroom always oh sorry sorry I had to use the bathroom oh how dare you have to

636
01:41:17,710 --> 01:41:22,750
go to the bathroom no no that you absolutely what if they're in the bathroom for two hours

637
01:41:22,909 --> 01:41:29,149
what if like you're on set filming one of your like big big dramas like a stick of baseball up his

638
01:41:29,149 --> 01:41:32,670
ass and like one of like the guy who's gonna stick it in your ass is in the bathroom for two

639
01:41:32,670 --> 01:41:49,979
hours and holds everything up I don't know I'd be like you you the bathroom is a complete and

640
01:41:49,979 --> 01:41:55,180
total fucking sanctuary if you well I don't know what if they're sick what if it's like I yeah I'm

641
01:41:55,180 --> 01:42:02,479
sorry but like we have to do it's like okay I understand I I guess like oh sorry a bit but and

642
01:42:03,119 --> 01:42:07,760
okay but if I disagree though completely again because like I would shit myself to win in a

643
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:12,239
quick play match in overwatch I would not let you down if I was on set so I would shit myself on

644
01:42:12,239 --> 01:42:18,399
camera for you but you hold on so what was the last time that you took like anything into like

645
01:42:18,399 --> 01:42:24,079
a newspaper or I have never in my life ever done that so what you just go in there sit down and

646
01:42:24,079 --> 01:42:30,960
just like go and then get up is it like so painful to be alone with your thoughts no I'm telling you

647
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:36,079
I like being alone with my thoughts so I like that private time in the bathroom are you alone

648
01:42:36,079 --> 01:42:40,319
with your thoughts if you're on vampire survivors or are you distracting yourself from your thoughts

649
01:42:40,319 --> 01:42:44,399
no no I can just kind of sit there and just like all right let's go I can like hang out

650
01:42:45,119 --> 01:42:49,859
and sometimes dude at the end of a vampire survivors run in the bathroom I pause it for

651
01:42:49,859 --> 01:42:55,699
a second and just contemplate when you sit on the toilet do you like today do you cross your legs

652
01:42:55,699 --> 01:43:02,340
like and meditate like that you are talking like style on the toilet dude I drink espresso

653
01:43:02,340 --> 01:43:11,819
when I take a shit sometimes you are talking to the wrong person what makes that wrong why why

654
01:43:11,819 --> 01:43:18,699
why are you the wrong person because I love my bathroom time and like I take baths I sip on

655
01:43:18,699 --> 01:43:25,340
espresso while I shit okay I play vampire survivors I get my switch again to recap just to boil this

656
01:43:25,340 --> 01:43:30,539
all down real quick for anyone who's confused vampire survivors is the game of the year because

657
01:43:30,539 --> 01:43:42,270
you can't play elden ring on the toilet yeah all right okay just to tie a knot on that real quick

658
01:43:43,579 --> 01:43:55,300
we killed another group of people by the way well that's too bad hey we can do it

659
01:43:56,020 --> 01:43:59,859
yeah we got time uh but no elden ring was game did you you went through the whole thing right

660
01:44:00,579 --> 01:44:08,800
yeah orphan a cough and all that so stir dark souls 2 is like the best dark souls

661
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:15,039
stir underscore right you what how do you feel about that I mean that that was years ago that

662
01:44:15,039 --> 01:44:20,720
I would have said that okay I am a controversial dark souls 2 enjoyer and my reason always was

663
01:44:20,720 --> 01:44:26,399
that because it had a lot of content and elden ring has a lot of content so I'm gonna have you

664
01:44:26,399 --> 01:44:31,840
know elden rings is the tops so you think it's the best that they've made for sure do you think

665
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:39,550
it's better than uh bloodborne oh I forgot no no you don't think so no I really takes it would

666
01:44:39,550 --> 01:44:46,369
take a masterpiece like an absolute above and beyond to be bloodborne for me I think a lot of

667
01:44:46,369 --> 01:44:52,029
that is just the aesthetic in the world like if elden ring was the bloodborne setting but that

668
01:44:52,029 --> 01:44:57,939
setting does a lot for me that's actually true if bloodborne was elden rings the kind of world the

669
01:44:57,939 --> 01:45:05,680
size and the scope yeah but the problem with bloodborne is because it was 10 years ago now

670
01:45:05,680 --> 01:45:14,050
right that's something like that it's been a while it's hard to say that oh elden rings better when

671
01:45:14,859 --> 01:45:19,920
if you think about at the time that was just so unbelievable when it came out but like elden ring

672
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:25,840
was so unbelievable when it came out like dude I have not had that a lot of articles would argue

673
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:30,640
with you about how unbelievable elden ring was on pc when it came out yeah but I know they were

674
01:45:30,640 --> 01:45:36,079
like the stuttering whatever I we everybody dealt with that the first week right that's

675
01:45:36,079 --> 01:45:41,539
just gonna happen that's blocked out of my memory that just happens but whatever it's a new release

676
01:45:41,539 --> 01:45:49,300
I know it was annoying uh but that first when you first opened up the map of elden ring and you

677
01:45:49,300 --> 01:45:56,100
realized that it wasn't just limb grave oh wow cool this is a big map it's kind of like a wow

678
01:45:56,100 --> 01:46:00,979
it's like as big as gta3 oh this is cool and you're in the back of your mind you're going oh cool

679
01:46:00,979 --> 01:46:06,210
all right yeah I wish it was bigger I wish it was a little bigger yeah then you go down the elevator

680
01:46:06,210 --> 01:46:10,930
and there's then the underground world yes and it and then it blows your mind just how big the

681
01:46:10,930 --> 01:46:18,560
game actually is yeah it was a great game I don't think something will come out and now you play no

682
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:22,399
dude play god of war I don't think it would even come close to me it wouldn't even come close I

683
01:46:22,399 --> 01:46:28,140
don't think the elden ring for me I played god of war of the but uh it's god of war one but it's

684
01:46:28,140 --> 01:46:35,250
not it's like the new god of war from like 2016 whatever it was yeah um I played the first like

685
01:46:35,250 --> 01:46:41,090
five to six hours of it and it was phenomenal it was phenomenal but I don't I don't know I

686
01:46:41,090 --> 01:46:46,529
feel like I still I don't know I I hear let me tell you let me hear what listen to me

687
01:46:47,170 --> 01:46:52,930

713
01:51:34,500 --> 01:51:42,140
what were you saying about like god of war is trash pick it back up I said that god the first

714
01:51:42,140 --> 01:51:46,619
one was phenomenal but like not so phenomenal was number one that you would even consider playing

715
01:51:46,619 --> 01:51:54,479
the second one it didn't grab me after the first 10 hours it was what an unbelievable like first

716
01:51:54,479 --> 01:51:58,640
quarter or first half of the game whatever it was it was awesome and it just like I couldn't it just

717
01:51:58,640 --> 01:52:12,449
but it it didn't suck me in true I've never played them the game is like 10 hours long what the hell

718
01:52:12,449 --> 01:52:17,279
wait what do you mean like what the hell was I doing the whole time the game is god of war

719
01:52:17,279 --> 01:52:28,180
is not 10 hours long god war is like 30 or 40 hours long it's not 10 hours what the hell how

720
01:52:28,180 --> 01:52:52,239
are you playing that this place was designed as a fire hazard oh I got it up hey I'm up here

721
01:52:55,220 --> 01:53:07,779
uh Ragnarok is even longer um I died where are you upstairs yeah Ragnarok online it takes a

722
01:53:07,779 --> 01:53:18,159
really long time to level we're gonna get rid of this okay we need the yellow everything is a key

723
01:53:18,159 --> 01:53:38,460
card no uh did you do the tutorial you open a window it sucks it up where's your device

724
01:53:41,380 --> 01:53:58,479
my key fob the orange key card is out why are you spoiling like spoilers and by the way just

725
01:53:58,479 --> 01:54:03,920
to be clear it doesn't have to be a device it should be the back of a shampoo bottle

726
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:20,739
you're you're sitting on the toilet reading a shampoo bottle it depends I don't know why

727
01:54:21,729 --> 01:54:29,470
just I don't know just because it's like just something to do I don't know you you don't think

728
01:54:29,630 --> 01:54:37,729
I feel like it's kind of weird um I feel weird just sitting there what are you distracting

729
01:54:37,729 --> 01:54:44,770
yourself from I just feel weird just sitting there I'm dead again hold on I'm going the floor

730
01:54:45,810 --> 01:54:56,479
fell apart where where can you ping no ping restart the mission we have three people

731
01:54:56,479 --> 01:55:07,390
rescued no restart the mission no restart okay no we're gonna win you just you're doing the stir

732
01:55:07,390 --> 01:55:11,710
thing where you're gonna now find the optimal route you're gonna find everything you can get

733
01:55:11,710 --> 01:55:18,739
everybody in like 10 seconds we have to rescue six people the building's burning I'm dead do you

734
01:55:18,739 --> 01:55:33,890
have any of the key fobs to even get into the room that I'm in ow you're distracting me with

735
01:55:33,890 --> 01:55:43,760
all of this reading shampoo bottles while pooping commentary okay see like this is the tutorial you

736
01:55:43,760 --> 01:55:51,699
just pick this up you see the key oh yeah all right see that's why we restarted because

737
01:55:51,699 --> 01:55:57,300
that seems very important to figure out and not go all there's all these key cards right here I

738
01:55:57,300 --> 01:56:02,739
thought these were tennis rackets I thought that they were like like when the choo-choo train has

739
01:56:02,739 --> 01:56:07,140
to change tracks and there's the thing in the ground and it goes left and right and that the

740
01:56:07,140 --> 01:56:11,859
train would come through the door I thought these were frying pans tennis rackets I did not know

741
01:56:11,939 --> 01:56:21,619
that's what this was all right I get it I get it let's go and there's red ones in there if you

742
01:56:21,619 --> 01:56:26,260
weren't like interrupting this mission with all of your like oh like oh I'm gonna make like a crazy

743
01:56:26,260 --> 01:56:38,050
take hey type stuff stupid stupid I just opened both doors okay good job stupid we need a blue

744
01:56:38,050 --> 01:56:48,880
key all right there is nobody up they're all kind of this one little floor up here and that's it

745
01:56:49,600 --> 01:56:57,779
you're actually lying not we need green look here last time we need green key yellow key

746
01:56:58,659 --> 01:57:15,060
okay so what is your what besides elven ring and vampire survivors which we already kind of

747
01:57:15,060 --> 01:57:22,939
concluded but what would you say are your top three games last year uh slice and dice and

748
01:57:22,939 --> 01:57:28,930
gotta work oh so you did play gotta work I had watched someone play it which was enough for me

749
01:57:28,930 --> 01:57:34,930
to say that that's a really good game I don't have a PlayStation 5 they actually don't exist

750
01:57:36,699 --> 01:57:41,100
but I I would have played it so you are vicariously giving game of the year through

751
01:57:41,100 --> 01:57:49,149
someone else ah yep okay uh because if I'm not allowed to do that then like the whole

752
01:57:49,149 --> 01:57:54,670
industry of like having analysts and uh you know consultants is kind of bullshit right

753
01:57:55,630 --> 01:58:00,159
what what does that mean I have to have like sports like they didn't actually play the sport

754
01:58:00,159 --> 01:58:07,420
right like a sports commentator like how stupid is that so do you think that the sports commentator

755
01:58:07,420 --> 01:58:15,760
should be on an nfl team I think they shouldn't like be playing the game yeah like how hard would

756
01:58:15,760 --> 01:58:19,279
it be to like break the legs of one of the nfl guys like they get hurt all the time and then

757
01:58:19,279 --> 01:58:24,560
they are the commentator so what should there be a different commentary league where it's just only

758
01:58:24,560 --> 01:58:31,359
the sports commentators against no I'm saying the opposite I'm saying that it's totally fine

759
01:58:31,359 --> 01:58:36,159
for a sports commentator to exist and I in this situation am the sports commentator who watched

760
01:58:36,159 --> 01:58:41,439
someone play god of war and realized that that is worthy of game of the year so you were sitting

761
01:58:41,439 --> 01:58:47,520
there circling with a pen with the that white pen on the glass you know how you can like watch a

762
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:52,640
movie and say like that's one of the best movies I've watched this year okay uh I did that but it

763
01:58:52,640 --> 01:59:01,279
was a video game so god of war is your favorite movie of 2022 uh I'd have to think about what

764
01:59:01,279 --> 01:59:10,020
movies actually came out because if we're judging by how you mean by that then that then god of war

765
01:59:10,020 --> 01:59:20,659
was a movie to you uh it's it's still objectively a video game I'm pretty sure god of war is a video

766
01:59:20,739 --> 01:59:31,899
game no matter if I watched it or played it get this out of here cut scenes are movies

767
01:59:37,279 --> 01:59:44,060
yeah what other options are there play what other games what other games why are you sitting here

768
01:59:44,060 --> 01:59:52,859
going like I don't know what else should I do about it what oh you know you I said I thought

769
01:59:52,859 --> 01:59:57,020
you were saying like what options do I have I thought you meant like what options do you have

770
01:59:57,819 --> 02:00:02,460
I mean what other games were there last year I beside like I'm not allowed my top three games

771
02:00:02,460 --> 02:00:06,220
of the year I'm not allowed to choose one of them what are what are what are my other options

772
02:00:06,220 --> 02:00:09,579
you've got vampire survivor and elder ring what's your number three you got no you don't even have

773
02:00:09,579 --> 02:00:16,060
a number three excuse me yes you didn't ask all right resume believe oh but is that like a real

774
02:00:16,060 --> 02:00:29,520
game or like a movie that's a game that's a real game what makes it real are video games art I think

775
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:39,970
so okay you're entitled to your opinion how did you get out of there

776
02:00:49,489 --> 02:00:57,710
are you 2016 ass argument did you jump out the window as an evil eight came out in 2021

777
02:00:59,039 --> 02:01:14,699
oh I don't laugh at me I did a top three what was it elden ring vampire survivors I was shouting

778
02:01:14,699 --> 02:01:27,460
about it during the game awards what was it no it was not scoring no it wasn't it was not scoring

779
02:01:28,340 --> 02:01:32,739
you guys just gave scorn game of the year because of the sound effect that played

780
02:01:33,699 --> 02:01:38,500
during when you complete a puzzle when there's a big a big a new environment that

781
02:01:38,500 --> 02:01:43,460
shows up and I agree that was it was cool uh my my oh multiverses multiverses yep

782
02:01:44,420 --> 02:01:55,619
both diverses for sure really did you even play multiverses I know you probably don't

783
02:01:55,619 --> 02:02:01,060
I didn't I think we talked about this you weren't you weren't like a platform fighter like smash

784
02:02:01,060 --> 02:02:07,569
kind of fan I didn't realize you actually liked it I thought it was uh you know just one of those

785
02:02:07,569 --> 02:02:13,970
things that you did that was good it's actually very good I can't get through this the floor is

786
02:02:13,970 --> 02:02:33,520
electrified I don't I don't have any water stir you downstairs there's like a uh a water cooler

787
02:02:34,319 --> 02:02:38,909
you know what I mean that you can uh you can juice up I'm gonna die I'm gonna die I'm dying

788
02:02:39,710 --> 02:02:52,050
I'm dead because this one this mission is rough okay oh yeah that's that's valid that I uh

789
02:02:58,500 --> 02:03:06,300
there's a guy in here a guy in the room full of electrified explosive barrels what are we

790
02:03:06,300 --> 02:03:18,380
supposed to do I don't why am I getting hurt by that but you're not I am oh you are oh my water

791
02:03:20,899 --> 02:03:30,109
water over there if you need it I think this is where we die uh or we could just get to the exit

792
02:03:30,109 --> 02:03:36,979
because we already did the mission rescue all clients six we have four out of three oh yeah but

793
02:03:36,979 --> 02:03:55,920
I think that's enough we're just okay let them die let's go let them die you got somebody what's

794
02:03:55,920 --> 02:04:07,250
your favorite cereal top three of 2022 uh favorite cereal the cereals is very mood dependent you know

795
02:04:07,890 --> 02:04:14,399
I feel that see we can play I need to get one of those mood rings and see the color before I

796
02:04:14,399 --> 02:04:25,890
can decide what cereal I want uh all right this one we'll we're gonna do this one on easy

02:04:38,210 --> 02:04:45,069
you want to know about me how do you feel about frosted mini wheats love them no I know why we

799
02:04:45,069 --> 02:04:51,699
don't agree with vampire survivors what's wrong with frosted mini wheats frosted mini wheats

800
02:04:52,739 --> 02:05:09,409
are great for exactly 10 seconds and then they are awful you don't how do you don't have a bowl

835
02:12:05,500 --> 02:12:17,390
that's it's like a maze they conveniently boarded up every single window just in case of a fire

836
02:12:18,029 --> 02:12:28,479
zero door okay there's a door up here this person burnt to death in my arms they've been cooking

838
02:12:39,649 --> 02:12:56,180
there what oops is it like an emote can I do like the floss or something that would solve this whole

839
02:12:56,180 --> 02:13:03,600
problem well you can get to the exit zone and we can accept that we saved four people you are

840
02:13:03,600 --> 02:13:14,100
overestimating how much I know where I am right now all right go left okay left left again left

841
02:13:14,100 --> 02:13:25,699
again okay go right all right it's I don't have a door I need a key open the door I don't have a

842
02:13:25,699 --> 02:13:35,060
blue key uh I got the blue key okay go up the stairs up the stairs no I got a blue key okay

843
02:13:41,100 --> 02:13:45,810
that there there that was all you had to do no it was the room I was down in that was the room

844
02:13:45,810 --> 02:13:52,930
I was in and that's the main lobby where you can exit from I just this chlorine flooding my eyes

845
02:13:52,930 --> 02:13:58,050
I just can't I can't see you can't see anything and then every door every chlorine yeah just like

846
02:13:58,050 --> 02:14:04,289
that like you can't see anything it's like all washed out and this like that like like I'm on

847
02:14:04,289 --> 02:14:09,250
the toilet playing vampire survivors like yeah that was a pretty good attempt for a callback joke

848
02:14:10,050 --> 02:14:16,899
a little flat isn't vampire survivors isn't though isn't the round always 30 minutes no

849
02:14:17,619 --> 02:14:25,460
or if you play in the speed mode it's 15 there is a 15 a couple of the places are 15 one of them's

850
02:14:25,460 --> 02:14:30,420
few of them are 20 did you even unlock any of the stages or did you just go I don't like this I'm

851
02:14:30,420 --> 02:14:35,380
unlocking and cheating I played it all I have like most of the stuff I beat it I beat it because

852
02:14:35,380 --> 02:14:41,539
there's like 10 maps yeah okay so yeah you know then why are you asking me this question well I'm

853
02:14:41,539 --> 02:14:44,979
asking you this question because I know like at a minimum it should be like 15 minutes and then

854
02:14:44,979 --> 02:14:55,840
you're on the toilet that whole time not necessarily yeah depends all right let's do a

855
02:14:55,840 --> 02:15:00,800
easier mission I thought that was easy it wasn't didn't you choose easy I did but we just wait if

856
02:15:00,800 --> 02:15:06,800
I have no idea what the hell we're doing um that was I think this one I think we're missing some

857
02:15:06,800 --> 02:15:22,289
gear you know what I'm saying let's go here this place we didn't do for some reason well okay but

858
02:15:22,289 --> 02:15:26,930
I need to can we get a poll can one of the mods get a pull up oh shit I don't know I don't have

859
02:15:26,930 --> 02:15:34,020
mod chat open they might have been trying to talk to me yeah I mean like I could I could help with

860
02:15:34,020 --> 02:15:50,670
that but okay there we go uh can somebody put a poll up for what is it but what is like an

861
02:15:50,670 --> 02:15:57,539
appropriate how do I word this what's an appropriate time where like that this time

862
02:15:57,539 --> 02:16:02,449
period is like you've been it's you've been in the bathroom for too long I would like option one to

863
02:16:02,449 --> 02:16:11,729
be more than 15 minutes option three more than 30 option four more than 45 I can for me can one

864
02:16:11,729 --> 02:16:18,130
option be only as long as it takes to finish yeah okay like as long as it takes and and the other

865
02:16:18,130 --> 02:16:23,810
option is as like finish as soon as possible I'm going in to do one task done get out no matter

866
02:16:23,810 --> 02:16:30,060
what two minutes it could be less than 10 minutes what is that period that's like after this amount

867
02:16:30,060 --> 02:16:43,120
of time it's it's okay this is a little bit you get what are you doing I'm trying to protect

868
02:16:43,120 --> 02:16:52,239
the structural integrity of the building because I'll give you my opinion after we see what people

869
02:16:52,239 --> 02:17:17,809
say and I'll get in here I can't get in that window they already know your opinion I actually

870
02:17:17,809 --> 02:17:38,899
don't think they do I got the two wow really easy missions are saved two people uh I think it's

871
02:17:38,899 --> 02:17:45,950
wow you're right the thing broke the wood broke as I walked across it they pranked me

872
02:17:46,750 --> 02:17:57,780
somebody's still in there I gotta check this hole in a second yeah we got a fire on the fourth

873
02:17:57,780 --> 02:18:11,090
floor coming down into the third uh we're gonna check this pole I just realized you're one of

874
02:18:11,090 --> 02:18:16,610
these guys that is in the bathroom what do you mean while the building's on fire you're still

875
02:18:16,610 --> 02:18:24,059
in the bathroom I would get out I would not stay but what if like you're in the middle of like

876
02:18:24,059 --> 02:18:27,739
you're about to beat like a really hard vampire survivor's level you've been trying to like you

877
02:18:27,739 --> 02:18:35,379
know unlock a character or something okay no I agree I agree okay 41 percent are saying that

878
02:18:35,379 --> 02:18:43,360
like more than 30 minutes is like pretty much a maximum I agree 45 I think really well here's the

879
02:18:43,360 --> 02:18:49,600
thing like I didn't like clarify this that well there are lots of times where I you know you take

880
02:18:49,600 --> 02:18:55,040
a shower and you use the bathroom right like in this you don't leave the bathroom we're not

881
02:18:56,239 --> 02:19:00,559
we are not talking about shower okay so we're talking about purely just going to the bathroom

882
02:19:00,559 --> 02:19:07,920
okay you can't get an out on this situation of like no I was I think a shower I'd say between

883
02:19:07,920 --> 02:19:25,920
30 and 45 is like all right get out like yeah shower shaving brushing your teeth

884
02:19:30,260 --> 02:19:33,379
all right what about is there any try to find the money we have like a minute

885
02:19:34,260 --> 02:19:47,040
half an hour well but in half an hour I would say is at that point it's too long

886
02:19:47,680 --> 02:19:58,459
what do you do for 30 minutes well I I am shocked that 30 minutes was your pole winner yeah I just

887
02:19:58,459 --> 02:20:03,440
fell into the goo I don't I really I don't know what's going on there we should I think we're

888
02:20:03,440 --> 02:20:15,200
gonna leave before this stuff burns down yeah let's get out of here oh my god this is an exit

889
02:20:15,200 --> 02:20:23,889
right should be yeah I got it in it yeah 30 minutes is probably a little too long like what

890
02:20:23,889 --> 02:20:28,290
about like watching a stream or watching like a like something you've never watched a streamer

891
02:20:28,290 --> 02:20:38,319
like no stream when you're on film no you've never like opened up like a youtube video

892
02:20:40,059 --> 02:20:47,680
or like browsed something like oh I'm gonna check no I've no god no why are you so against this

893
02:20:48,399 --> 02:20:59,629
no like what like can't you just go to the bathroom finish then like go back to your tv or

894
02:20:59,629 --> 02:21:08,659
computer and finish watching something what why can't you do both all right we're gonna try the

895
02:21:08,659 --> 02:21:16,799
office building all right after this mission I want to buy some new stuff okay then I will I

896
02:21:16,799 --> 02:21:21,920
will wait to buy things have you watched a whole season of a show no actually I watched

897
02:21:22,639 --> 02:21:27,120
um I the only time I've ever done anything like that well not like this but

898
02:21:27,760 --> 02:21:35,860
I watched an entire season of Breaking Bad I believe it was in one day and I to maximize

899
02:21:35,860 --> 02:21:40,739
the time that I was watching Breaking Bad I did watch like a full episode on the toilet

900
02:21:41,840 --> 02:21:47,969
because it's like I have to I have to because I need to make sure that I have I'm getting the

901
02:21:47,969 --> 02:21:52,959
most out of my day watching this so in mid-episode I had to go to the bathroom

902
02:21:52,959 --> 02:22:00,110
and I just paused it went right in turn it back on here we go I while making breakfast while

903
02:22:00,110 --> 02:22:08,590
making dinner eating and I remember lying in bed at the end of this day and this I was like nine

904
02:22:08,590 --> 02:22:15,389
ten episode whatever it was like almost 10 episodes into the season and I my whole body hurt

905
02:22:16,350 --> 02:22:22,770
I was lying there like my eyes hurt I was like oh like I had only been looking at this

906
02:22:23,329 --> 02:22:30,530
screen for like 10 11 12 straight hours it was like almost a season plus and I remember just

907
02:22:30,530 --> 02:22:37,250
being I was lying on my side and I had the lock on the iPad so it wouldn't tilt to go vertical

908
02:22:37,250 --> 02:22:42,930
I was lying on my side holding it like this and so to make sure it was still horizontal and just

909
02:22:43,010 --> 02:22:54,079
going now and I was like almost done hey hey hey hey hey hey I'm I'm I'm confused at the moral

910
02:22:54,079 --> 02:23:04,700
of the story I mean there was none the moral of the story was I've somebody said have you ever

911
02:23:04,700 --> 02:23:11,260
watched like a season of TV on the toilet and my answer was no but I've done something kind of in

912
02:23:11,260 --> 02:23:18,739
that same world how do I open this door there's a bunch of pressure pads everywhere

913
02:23:26,540 --> 02:23:30,379
I feel like I missed a part of it because all I really heard you say was I watched breaking

914
02:23:30,379 --> 02:23:39,920
bad until it hurt you know we have okay that's isn't that just kind of it's funny how that's

915
02:23:39,920 --> 02:23:47,360
sort of weird proof that like you know weekly episodes probably you know I it's spacing stuff

916
02:23:48,159 --> 02:23:55,040
it's really not necessarily a bad thing because I'll tell you I binged breaking bad I didn't see

917
02:23:55,040 --> 02:24:04,459
it when it was on the air I watched it years later in like 11 days the entire series and I

918
02:24:04,459 --> 02:24:09,659
don't think I can tell you I don't remember anything it is just melded together into this

919
02:24:09,659 --> 02:24:17,040
mush in my brain I don't even know what happened in the show and I think when you say out loud oh

920
02:24:17,040 --> 02:24:22,000
yeah I watched a whole season of Breaking Bad until it hurt my head it's like maybe I should

921
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:31,010
have faced it out like once a week or something maybe not that much I'm speechless I wish I had

922
02:24:31,010 --> 02:24:39,969
comments worried about you and I've been stuck in the same room for the last five minutes here

923
02:24:39,969 --> 02:24:46,700
yeah I'm not saying anything about it these things need a face scanner but it's not working

924
02:24:47,260 --> 02:24:53,500
do we have to bring somebody over here do you think that it needs your face the person who's

925
02:24:53,500 --> 02:25:02,100
never been here before but I can't leave because I don't have somebody else's face

926
02:25:03,139 --> 02:25:17,340
oh there you are hi hi what was that the Muppet movie ah general we have our new

927
02:25:17,340 --> 02:25:36,590
retinal scanner and he like back the bear how classic Muppets oh oh we do need a face scanner

928
02:25:36,590 --> 02:25:39,629
okay that's what I'm saying I haven't been able to leave this area

929
02:25:41,780 --> 02:25:53,649
well just walk out you forgot to say forehead I think we've like already rescued everyone else

930
02:25:54,450 --> 02:25:58,450
so we'll have to like go get one of the people we've already rescued so just walk out

931
02:26:01,569 --> 02:26:19,969
go on just walk out okay just walk out okay all right all right all right I thought that

932
02:26:19,969 --> 02:26:24,370
was gonna take you a little bit longer a little bit longer than directly to exactly where you

933
02:26:24,370 --> 02:26:37,120
need to go okay I'm bringing in I'm bringing one of these four steps back into the fire

934
02:26:38,239 --> 02:26:49,629
why are you so passive aggressive what we're not you can't where is this last person I think

935
02:26:49,629 --> 02:26:54,670
they're behind that door where you need the face scanner but we we can't I think we kind of did

936
02:26:54,670 --> 02:26:59,379
this wrong I do think we kind of did this wrong burning I'm burning I'm burning I'm burning

937
02:27:00,340 --> 02:27:18,180

939
02:27:23,520 --> 02:27:27,760

940
02:27:27,760 --> 02:27:34,670
item I'm out I'm out of water I'm in a fire he didn't do it either let me just make sure

941
02:27:34,670 --> 02:27:39,069

942
02:27:39,069 --> 02:27:44,219
you just had to knock it down I was just at that door

943
02:27:46,290 --> 02:27:51,090

they do have a mod where you can do it how hard is the mod to set up is it pain or is it easy uh

968
02:32:34,610 --> 02:32:40,610
I've I've modded stuff for before it's not very hard people do co-op with randomizer

969
02:32:42,209 --> 02:32:50,260
actually that would be kind of funny sir do you want to do uh co-op elden ring with randomizer on

970
02:32:50,979 --> 02:32:57,440
uh random enemies or random items or both I think just just randomize the whole thing so we like

971
02:32:57,440 --> 02:33:03,440
like margaret can just like be in like a dungeon just walking around yeah I I played a little

972
02:33:03,440 --> 02:33:10,219
bit with that early on when it was a lot less functional but it was fun there's also one that

973
02:33:10,219 --> 02:33:14,379
randomizes like every item drop in the world I think it's part of the same thing feel like

974
02:33:14,379 --> 02:33:18,299
you'll go like you don't like pre-plan like oh this is the spot where you get the sword like

975
02:33:18,299 --> 02:33:25,340
you'll kill margaret and get like a pocketful of sand really okay yeah but also like the first

976
02:33:25,340 --> 02:33:32,780
item you pick up could be like you know void forage drop from shaper yeah all right let's

977
02:33:32,780 --> 02:33:42,459
do it soon what's your schedule like okay uh I'm myriad's returning on Thursday so I really need to

979
02:33:50,399 --> 02:33:57,280
tabletop show that I run on my channel you know I got some known gamers from twitch streamers

980
02:33:57,280 --> 02:34:02,559
you know just you know playing along interesting I'm the dungeon master and also I made the whole

981
02:34:02,559 --> 02:34:10,370
thing and you know you ask me that every time and it's like uh one of these days you'll know

982
02:34:10,370 --> 02:34:19,340
because you'll get to play and it definitely will happen one day yeah and where could they find you

983
02:34:24,959 --> 02:34:31,899
not stir like a bowl stir like the Dutch word for star wait is that what that is it's not it's it is

984
02:34:31,899 --> 02:34:38,139
star in a lot of different languages really yeah I didn't know that that's a little bit of lore

985
02:34:38,379 --> 02:34:54,459
there now I don't hear the switches I got it I got it I got it oh my god we're getting electrified

986
02:34:58,860 --> 02:35:18,450
uh now you're thinking with portals oh clever boy but yeah too long didn't read I could play next

987
02:35:18,450 --> 02:35:31,819
week okay cool or after Thursday let's uh let's figure out how to set it up oh that hurts me

988
02:35:32,540 --> 02:35:35,180
I'm surprised I'm surprised you're interested in doing it

989
02:35:36,059 --> 02:35:40,940
well I mean you played elder ring but like normally I feel like we did switch personalities

990
02:35:40,940 --> 02:35:44,379
because I'm the guy who will come to you like do you want to play this game also install all of

991
02:35:44,379 --> 02:35:53,620
this random shit yeah I mean I'll be honest if this was any other from software game then

992
02:35:54,579 --> 02:35:59,379
put down your summoning stone hold on wait no that's not you are we on the same password

993
02:35:59,379 --> 02:36:04,100
um I don't know there's eight summoning stones here oh no I just I just uh sorry I just brought

994
02:36:04,100 --> 02:36:10,180
in this guy a ball fondler oh yeah whoops I'm sorry we just got invaded five times oh whoops

995
02:36:10,979 --> 02:36:14,659
that's why it's more fun all right yeah like we can actually potentially do it

996
02:36:20,670 --> 02:36:25,709
oh wait you died oh shit time to spend 20 minutes resetting that whole thing up again

997
02:36:27,760 --> 02:36:50,059
that that's why that was always never fun to do all true what a dogshit game okay there's people

998
02:36:50,059 --> 02:36:58,620
in where are these people oh on the ground the seamless co-op mod is really easy to okay that's

999
02:36:58,620 --> 02:37:08,209
encouraging it's good to know yeah souls modding stuff is always pretty simple we've got like

1000
02:37:09,649 --> 02:37:15,969
thousands of people on the job so do you want to make some rules here some rules because I imagine

1001
02:37:15,969 --> 02:37:24,079
in here get the money I imagine if we if we pull this off and we do this right do do we get okay

1002
02:37:24,079 --> 02:37:29,760
let's say we start and where you know when the first place you spawn where like the tree sentinel

1003
02:37:29,760 --> 02:37:37,979
is is like one of the dragons like do we have to beat that or do you like what are the rules like

1004
02:37:37,979 --> 02:37:45,440
can we reset and like redo a seed like what do we have the rules you can run away from things

1005
02:37:45,440 --> 02:37:51,760
but then chat's gonna spam but then like serious like if if the first boss in the direction we go

1006
02:37:51,840 --> 02:37:57,760
is like millennia right there is a degree of like why are we here like we just physically can't do

1007
02:37:57,760 --> 02:38:09,280
it the enemy scales the dragon is just as powerful as the tree sentinel really okay if that's the

1008
02:38:09,280 --> 02:38:15,520
case then that's kind of funny that sounds good it sounds good to me they scale all right okay

1009
02:38:15,520 --> 02:38:32,819
time to leave we got all the guys health and damage bowl skill I'm done I'm down all right

1010
02:38:32,819 --> 02:38:41,069
