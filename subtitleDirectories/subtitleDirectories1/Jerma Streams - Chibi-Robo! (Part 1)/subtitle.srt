1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:10,890
Hello, hello, hello. Good afternoon. How are you? Good. I'm doing good. I'm doing okay.

2
00:00:11,529 --> 00:00:17,379
Got some good news for those of you that were at the stream yesterday into today.

3
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:30,780
Memory card works. I got a uh, got a new one. Chibi-Robo is a go. No corruption,

4
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:39,939
no reformatting necessary. We're good to go. Already tested it. I played through the first

5
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:46,579
part of Chibi-Robo to make sure I could save the... I'm not gonna swear yet. Make sure I could save

6
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:56,500
the darn game and I can. So we're good to go. If you missed the tutorial, uh, just

7
00:00:57,219 --> 00:01:01,299
watch the rage-filled first 40 minutes of yesterday's stream and you'll see it.

8
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:09,340
I'll give you a quick rundown. Uh, it's, it's, it's Ribbit Girl's birthday. Happy birthday.

9
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,709
And we have to make the family happy. That's it? Did you make the ghost leave? Yeah, I've been

10
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:24,409
burning incense in my room all day. I keep hearing this faint screaming coming from the corners of

11
00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:32,099
the room. All right, I got, it says time in here now. Good luck. I got time incense around the whole

12
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:39,590
room. Good luck. Made a couple of phone calls. Bugleberry told me that that was the best thing

13
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:45,750
to do. Sprinkle time in the corners of your room and wear a garlic necklace. And the memory

14
00:01:45,750 --> 00:02:01,129
card works. So I, I don't know what to believe anymore. Where's the real German? Show us the

15
00:02:01,129 --> 00:02:07,129
necklace. Well, the thing is it was a garlic necklace and I love that stuff. So after a few

16
00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:14,580
hours of sitting here waiting and meditating and had a little bit of a snack, I can't help myself.

17
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:25,479
You're a vampire hunter. Yeah, Chibi-Robo, I'm so excited. Now I can actually enjoy the game for

18
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:41,960
what it's supposed to be. That poor garlic. Yeah, I'm ready to go. Here it is. You want to see? Would

19
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:47,639
you guys like to see? Check this out. Ready? Let's plug it in and just make sure that this works.

20
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:59,219
There's the plug. Okay. We have to gain Chibi ranking again. It's okay. 60 more happy points.

21
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:05,139
While you're here, Chibi-Robo, would you like to save? I would love to. And look at that.

22
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:22,060
Now saving. No corrupted memory. I'm so happy. Please reformat. Don't say that shit.

23
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:35,689
Did you slam your memory card into the door? Fuck that thing. I really thought it was going

24
00:03:35,689 --> 00:03:39,930
to work yesterday. All right, I'm ready. So the whole goal, I know a lot of you've been waiting

25
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:44,330
for the Sovi. Now the goal is to make everybody happy in the house. You do chores

26
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:53,669
and I'm going to go do them. You pick up trash. You do laundry. It's like my favorite game ever

27
00:03:53,669 --> 00:04:07,460
made. All right, let's go. This game is going to make me depressed. What? Why is Chibi-Robo going

28
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:20,180
to make you depressed? He's emulating. Cut the stream. I'm not. Yeah, Dad had a lot of fun at

29
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:28,519
the birthday party. Again, this was a birthday party that we were at. Yeah, sun symbol during

30
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:33,000
the day, moon symbol at night. The moon is out right now. That means it's nighttime, of course.

31
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:41,779
All right, let's get happy points. Time to clean the lid. All right, we did this stuff before,

32
00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:48,980
but I'm going to do it again. Offer trash. We're going to throw this stuff in the recycling bin.

33
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:54,810
We're in the trash can. Show the new memory card. Nope, I'm not touching it.

34
00:04:56,009 --> 00:05:02,329
I'm going to pour cement into this hole where it's plugged in. This is never coming up ever again.

35
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:14,379
Oh, we saw this yesterday. Dear Diary. Yeah, we were looking at the diary. It's not going to

36
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:23,449
work again. I'm going to put super blue in that hole. Now, but tonight he was lazy and I can watch

37
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:28,009
Drake while he patrols. It's so hard to watch him. That knight in shining armor.

38
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:39,319
Will you poop? I said I'm going to pour cement into the hole.

39
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:52,040
You heard that wrong. Dude, I saw something actually so funny today. This is not a connection

40
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:57,800
to that, but I had to tell this story. So I'm out doing errands and I'm getting shit done.

41
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:03,560
And I pull up and the thing about living in Vegas is this tons of crazy shit that happens

42
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,240
all the time in Vegas, right? So there's a big intersection, huge intersection,

43
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:12,680
probably at least a hundred cars on all sides of the intersection. And on the corner

44
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,680
of the intersection is a guy in a frog costume dancing around with a sign,

45
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:22,759
which that's not completely out of the ordinary. He's just doing all these crazy moves. He's like

46
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:29,639
lunging forward, lunging forward, spin, spin, spin, point, point at that car, point at that car,

47
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,240
point at that car, right? And that's, there's nothing, it's not like, oh, well, that's hilarious

48
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:41,529
or anything, right? But like for 200 feet down from this guy is a bus stop. And the people at

49
00:06:41,529 --> 00:06:50,379
this bus stop were fucking furious with this guy. All of them had this face. They were all just so

50
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:57,189
angry. Like, what the fuck is this guy doing? I'm just sitting there going, this is, I mean,

51
00:06:57,189 --> 00:07:01,589
yeah, how can you be, can you, can you really be mad at the dancing frog guy? Like, come on.

52
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:10,389
And I'm sitting there thinking, because this is a red light. If people start to go after the frog

53
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:15,829
guy, I gotta get out and I gotta, I would pull over and I'd get out and I would defend the frog

54
00:07:15,829 --> 00:07:20,649
guy. You know what I mean? Why would that? I don't know. I don't know why they were so angry with

55
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,240
him. He was giving it his all. He was dancing so hard. He was doing so many moves

56
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:31,399
and this whole, I'm talking to all the people at this bus stop. It wasn't just one person.

57
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:37,050
They're all just staring at him with this face, like this. Well, not like that, but like this.

58
00:07:41,269 --> 00:07:45,829
Just saying, what the fuck? Are they gonna like fight this guy? Cause he's dancing for like a sail?

59
00:07:47,319 --> 00:08:05,189
Star Wars! That's your resting face. I, it was ridiculous. I'm just sitting there going,

60
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:12,259
why is this happening? All right. Let's, we, we, we did this yesterday. We got some big bits too.

61
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:23,750
We just got like $50. Hold on. They all have resting, like mad frog face. I want a free shirt.

62
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:32,360
Is today the last wink day? No, not today. It's coming up soon though. Where's the wink discount?

63
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:41,960
It's not today. It's not today. All right. Passionate love for Drake Redcrest. It's fine.

64
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:54,779
The discount is going to be 67K. That'd be funny. I did fix the memory card issue. We're good to go.

65
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:58,460
We're just trying to get to the point where I was at last night, but yesterday afternoon,

66
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:06,059
just pretty much like right here. After the diary part is when I started to go, guys, you know what?

67
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:11,019
Oh, you know, you know what? No, I can't. I'm going to have to pivot, right? That's,

68
00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:19,399
that's kind of when this happened. All right. But we, hold on. We had huge money coming. We

69
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:25,159
have 5,000 bits coming from Bitslave. Thanks for the $50 Bitslave. They say, Hey Jerma,

70
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:28,039
I want to thank you again for taking a couple of days off streaming just to play League of

71
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:31,879
Legends with me. This didn't happen. I had a lot of fun yesterday when we had that whole bottle of

72
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:35,720
Johnny Walker and we were just running it down mid. Thought my account was going to get banned

73
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:41,639
again. Laughing my ass off. Anyways, I can rest easy now that you've played League. No sense denying

74
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:45,559
it now. Chat knows the truth. Just come clean. Also sorry for calling you a boomer the other day.

75
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:53,370
Dude, we got to, we got to get you another game. Can I, can I interest you in a GameCube?

76
00:09:53,370 --> 00:10:11,740
All right. You can climb wires here. Dude, I love the GameCube. Thanks for the $50 dude. League was

77
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:19,740
so much fun when we played it last night. I, dude, do you remember when I was twisted fate

78
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:27,639
and I did that fall almost penta? I'm not a jungler typically. So that's why it was hard.

79
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:38,259
We've ran it down mid. Me as the jungle. You as the solo lane. We came and we rescued all. Remember

80
00:10:38,259 --> 00:10:47,539
it was, um, oh dude, our team, our team consisted of, God, who was it? It was, uh, Teemo. Me as

81
00:10:47,539 --> 00:11:08,539
twisted fate as always. Um, Ewan rise and, um, dual lane was, uh, Vi and Garrett? Garrison? What's

82
00:11:08,539 --> 00:11:16,179
the guy with the sword? I forget what his name was. Who's the guy with the sword? Oh no, wait.

83
00:11:16,179 --> 00:11:20,340
That's it. That's like a different mobile game that I played. Hold on. What's the mobile game

84
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:24,179
with a guy with the sword is the first character. It's like a mobile MOBA and I downloaded it for

85
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:30,620
free. I played it for 10 minutes. Who was it? No, it's not rage shadow legends. It was another one.

86
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:34,940
It was another, it was a popular one. It was a, no, no, no. What is it? Arena of valor. There it is.

87
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:45,779
Yep. All right. Uh, I'm going to run. Wait, wait, wait. I got to do some stuff. I remember at the

88
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:52,100
last Twitch con or maybe we have, it was a Twitch con. Arena of valor was in the Twitch partner

89
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:58,899
lounge and it was like, Hey, you guys want to play arena of valor? I'm just like, God, no, but,

90
00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:08,379
Oh, yeah, sure. Like, dad, that sounds like fun. And I played like one run. How do I climb down?

91
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,159
And after, um, and I know they were going to come over and ask me all these questions.

92
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,620
We played one round and it was like, dude, Hey, that's just, you'd finished.

93
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:31,480
How was it? What do you think? Oh, it's fine. It was fun. Oh, all right. It's okay. My spine is intact.

94
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:53,509
And what do you say? I think I played, I played smite, but no. Are you going to save? Yes, of

95
00:12:53,509 --> 00:13:06,090
course I am. But yeah. And then I wanted to like avoid the tables where they were. I'm fucking weird

96
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:09,769
guys. Like I didn't want to like go back over to the tables because I was like, I was one of the

97
00:13:09,769 --> 00:13:16,059
people that played the game and it was just, if I sit over at those tables against me like, Hey,

98
00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:24,659
you're back. How about another fucking round? Yeah. No, thank you. Yeah. I guess I'm just here for a

99
00:13:24,659 --> 00:13:32,779
water. I just came in here to get a water, but I mean, it's all right. It's a cool games. All right.

100
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:44,870
Yeah. Just wait till we throw this shit in the trash. Always pick up the plug because you run

101
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:47,830
faster. That's a tip I got yesterday. Even without any, I haven't even started the game yet.

102
00:13:48,789 --> 00:14:01,539
That's why, I mean, you might think I'm weird, but going to like Twitch con and stuff,

103
00:14:02,659 --> 00:14:06,500
I almost want to put on like a disguise, like a mustache, a hat and like sunglasses.

104
00:14:07,299 --> 00:14:16,059
Cause it's like somebody, if somebody ever comes over and like a partner lounge is like, Hey,

105
00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:23,299
Oh, what are your channels? I don't have, I got the mustache. I don't have one. Oh, okay.

106
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:32,379
See you guys around. You have to do an incognito cosplay like Savage does.

107
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:54,169
No, I'm talking about just like a mustache. That might be a good idea. I don't know.

108
00:14:54,809 --> 00:15:05,460
Maybe I would do it one day. Oh, there's a coin in here. Nice. Just put on like fake eyebrows and

109
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:14,710
shit of a glue on big bushy mustache and like a fake chin strap or something and just walk around

110
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:18,710
and just, and if anyone comes up to me and asks me what channel is, I just say, I don't have one.

111
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:25,379
Hey, can I, can I interest you in playing some arena valor? Wait, wait, wait, who are you?

112
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:30,259
Don't have a name tag on you. Who are you? I don't, I just walk around with my mustache.

113
00:15:30,259 --> 00:15:33,700
Oh, and I don't give a shit. I don't fucking care about you. Any, any partners over here?

114
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:48,440
Be so much easier. Can I get in here? Come on. I can get that. All right. It's time to go to bed.

115
00:15:49,929 --> 00:15:57,289
Oh, there's so many coins. All right. I have to turn the TV on and wake up dad, right?

116
00:15:58,009 --> 00:16:04,340
Don't forget the chibi coffee. Yeah, that's right. That's right. I do have that.

117
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:06,580
I'm just so happy that I actually get to play the game.

118
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:21,980
Hannah Montana. No, but Hannah Montana just had a different color hair. That was it.

119
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:28,440
If I walked into Twitch con with just like orange hair, I'm still, I'm Jeremy. Like that

120
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:41,720
doesn't change anything. It was two different people. No. Okay. If Miley Cyrus had a must,

121
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:49,639
if, okay, Miley Cyrus is Hannah Montana. She put on like a wig and like a mustache and like sunglasses

122
00:16:49,639 --> 00:17:03,659
and that was Hannah Montana. It might be, you could hide. Spoiler alert. You don't, please.

123
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:15,190
Why do you know so much about Hannah Montana? But that I know that Hannah Montana is Miley Cyrus,

124
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:22,250
the actress that plays Hannah Montana. Oh, is that so? That's not a whole lot of information.

125
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:31,539
I need, I need to get some real happy points here. You bet your ass I want to say.

126
00:17:37,509 --> 00:17:41,109
Is it banned? That show's not even, it's been off the air for 10 years. What are you talking about?

127
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:57,140
Well, I thought we were going to bed. Oh, I just got up.

128
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:09,210
All right, fine. I thought I could go to bed. I thought saving did it. So did you watch it? No,

129
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:17,289
I didn't. I, yes. Okay. I have watched Hannah Montana in the same way that you've watched

130
00:18:17,289 --> 00:18:25,690
Hannah Montana. When you go from Fox Sports to the Disney channel, to Cartoon Network. So I've seen

131
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:32,839
12 seconds of Hannah Montana, maybe like four or five episodes worth. So

132
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:42,710
we've all seen it. Can you make the noise this thing is making? Yeah, probably.

133
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:57,640
That's pretty close. Yeah, I can turn into a super frog.

134
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:07,509
Who owns the super frog license? And can they become in contact? I have some consulting I

135
00:19:07,509 --> 00:19:10,150
could do. I got some consultant work I could do for that new game, bringing it back.

136
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:15,819
All right. Oh, yes. Of course. Every time it tells me to, I'm going to save every time.

137
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:32,089
All right, let's go. I don't think anyone owns super frog. Somebody does. All right, let's get

138
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:52,089
going. Coins. Happy point. Give me that. Give me that frog binky, whatever it is.

139
00:19:53,049 --> 00:20:04,549
Wait, does the music change how fast you walk? That's insane. Really? Bring. All right. Yeah,

140
00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:20,759
whatever it is. Frog ring. It does. You're always on beat no matter what in Chibi-Robo.

141
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:25,829
That's crazy. All right, let's go get some happy points here. We have to

142
00:20:25,829 --> 00:20:43,480
make a Ribbit girl laugh or something, right? Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit, ribbit. Yep. Climb on

143
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:59,220
my hand. Climb, ribbit. Oh, I didn't even realize that. Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit. Make the same joke.

144
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:24,039
No, I can't do that. Drop it. Clean up. I need to pick up all the trash. What does Dad want for

145
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:33,450
happiness? We got to go faster. Dad, what does Dad want? Hey there, Chibi-Robo. How goes it?

146
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:39,450
You're getting used to our hubs? My wife sheep mad at me. Sheep, but I don't worry. Sheep about it.

147
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:52,220
Just go get a load of happy points, okay? What do I put up here? Is there still

148
00:21:52,380 --> 00:22:02,490
some trash right there? I got seconds on me at time. Am I going to Pax? I am not going to Pax.

149
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:20,119
I will not be at Pax East. I ain't going anywhere. If I do go, I'm going with a Mustat. Three happy

150
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:27,450
points. Six happy points. All right, I have enough happy points to upgrade the character.

151
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:39,960
You got 120 bucks too. Nice. All right. What else is up here? It'll be there in disguise.

152
00:22:42,809 --> 00:22:50,359
Can I open the door? Chibi-Robo? Oh, it's just a sticker that someone put over the cracked window.

153
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,680
If you shoot that with the Chibi Blaster, I bet you can go outside.

154
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:02,150
Breaking windows won't make Mrs. Sanderson happy at all. Can I just say, can we just ask her to

155
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:10,200
slide the door open? Can I climb this? All right, I got to use the Chibi Copter. Oh wait, there's

156
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:18,440
Cheetos under here. How much does it cost to get a birthday shout out from Bugleberry?

157
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:30,660
How much does it cost? It costs absolutely nothing. Oh, I heard it was somebody's birthday.

158
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:38,420
Someone, someone told me there was a terrifying birthday party. I wish I was invited, but happy

159
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:45,369
birthday to you and to all the people at your birthday party. I'll be here in Jeremy's room

160
00:23:45,369 --> 00:24:06,250
warning off the ghosts and ghouls. Goodbye. Get out, get out. Do I have that on a hot key?

161
00:24:07,289 --> 00:24:15,140
But let's charge. I'm losing viewers. I'm losing viewers.

162
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:36,420
Oh, it feels so good just to be able to go like this. Oh, that probably hurt. All right,

163
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:53,079
what's left? Let's go up. I'm going to climb the chair. Wait, there's trash. Up on the chair

164
00:24:54,039 --> 00:25:03,819
there's tons of trash over here too. Oh yeah, I love picking up trash. Nice. This game is like

165
00:25:03,819 --> 00:25:09,500
exactly what I'm looking for. How do I get up there? All right. Well, wait, wait, wait, wait,

166
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:25,289
wait. I can, can I jump on this? Oh yeah. Oh yes, I can. So why can I hold on? Oh, I need to pull

167
00:25:25,289 --> 00:25:37,180
this. Push it right up against the wall here. I want to, I can get these bolts and up. Yeah.

168
00:25:37,339 --> 00:25:53,339
Nice. It's $50. How much, I'm almost out of time. All right. Then I'm going to fly over

169
00:25:53,339 --> 00:26:04,019
to this here. Let's pick up the trash. I love this game already. I love this game. It's so,

170
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:18,890
it's exactly what I'm looking for every time. Oh, I'm almost out of battery. It's just about

171
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:22,890
picking up trash and it's so, it's, there's no stress here.

172
00:26:25,289 --> 00:26:35,190
Space hunter Drake Redcrest is on soon. Can't wait. Woo. It's on TV. This is a fake news

173
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:42,069
emergency alert. Huh? This just didn't. Chibi Robo's everywhere are coming under attack

174
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:52,740
and the perpetrators appear to be the spy doors. Where do they come from?

175
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:57,779
Why do they attack? We don't know. I thought it was going to be, perhaps they hate Chibi Robo's

176
00:26:57,779 --> 00:27:06,900
winning smile. Viewers ask yourself, is your Chibi Robo safe or is it in mortal danger?

177
00:27:09,259 --> 00:27:16,220
This is Ron Brokejaw reporting for Faux News. Is it Fox News or Faux News?

178
00:27:17,099 --> 00:27:21,460
Now let's go to Sunny Merriweather with tomorrow's forecast, Sunny.

179
00:27:24,339 --> 00:27:30,259
Thanks, Ron. You're going to life by forecast. Tomorrow will be sunny, rainy or uphilly.

180
00:27:32,579 --> 00:27:39,420
Same energy. No, that's all wrong. The spiders are the Chibi Robo's friends. They are,

181
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:45,980
at least they should be. Ah, frosting. Listen, Chibi Robo, you need to be careful. Those

182
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:51,339
spiders are dangerous right now. If something were to happen to you, I'd be really sad. Got it?

183
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:56,970
Why don't you fucking put some like anti-spider defense system in the house?

184
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:04,099
Oh, we just had five community subs just coming. Just some normal guy 25. Thanks for the five

185
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:10,970
community subs. I gotta, no, no, no, no, I'm trying to pick up the, I hope you make it a number one

186
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:16,890
in the Chibi Robo ranking. Oh, by the way, the room looks really clean today. You must have

187
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:35,099
worked so hard. Yup. 10 happy points from dad for cleaning up his mess. All right, cool. Now I need,

188
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:39,769
I don't think I can make that. All right, I gotta go. Let's go plug in.

189
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:50,420
Fuck. What happens if I go to zero? Um, I need an outlet right now. Outlet right now. Where's an

190
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:55,299
outlet? Right now. I need an outlet right now. What about, I'm going to die. What happens if

191
00:28:55,299 --> 00:29:09,079
Chibi Robo dies? It's okay. We got saved by the bell. Chibi Robo, time sure flies when you're

192
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:13,799
making folks happy. Oh, the day has ended. Let's return to the Chibi house. Plug in.

193
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:26,250
I got 60 happy points though. Great work out there. Let's adjust your happy point total.

194
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:38,259
Your Chibi ranking has gone from 591,000 to 192,000. So these are, I'm against other Chibi Robos.

195
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:49,579
What are these other 300,000 Chibi Robos doing? 400,000 of them. I picked up like five pieces of

196
00:29:49,579 --> 00:30:00,200
trash. Battle Royale. They're dying to spiders. In order to get the next bonus battery, you need

197
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:05,940
eight more happy points. You're ever going to become super Chibi Robo. You need some advice,

198
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:11,529
namely mine. Use Y to activate your Chibi vision and scan your surroundings for items.

199
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:17,450
Use R to open up a map of the room and find yourself a nearby outlet. Oh, that's good to know.

200
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:22,569
To celebrate opening my advice booth, I'm handing up free advice.

201
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:32,970
I would love to save. Going up the rankings.

202
00:30:35,289 --> 00:30:39,750
All right. Now, can I do anything? What can I do with the Chibi computer?

203
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:49,509
My online shop. Timer 10, timer 15. What do these do? 10 minutes for half a day

204
00:30:49,509 --> 00:30:57,500
for a leisurely pace. Come on. Timer 15. 15 minutes for half a day for a truly leisurely pace.

205
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:07,880
So what? Is this just better? Timer 15. Oh, it's a timer. I get it. So I just get more time.

206
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:12,839
Pink flower seed. Pink flower will grow from this seed.

207
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:22,650
Nectar. Chibi blasters. 1100 bucks. I get 15 minutes. Yeah, that's better. I get these seeds.

208
00:31:23,529 --> 00:31:33,609
All right. Pink flower seed. Blue flower seed. And white flower seed. Okay. What about recycle

209
00:31:33,609 --> 00:32:03,269
atron? I have to plant these? Timer 15. Chibi Robo and Smash Brothers. Yes. No, not yet. He's

210
00:32:03,269 --> 00:32:27,339
a spirit. He's a costume. Oh, yeah. He was a me costume. He should be a real character, Pepe

211
00:32:27,339 --> 00:32:41,289
Handsome. All right. What about Drake on the TV? Drake on TV, right? Here's the map. Backyard.

212
00:32:41,289 --> 00:32:47,769
We got plugs. C is zoom. Oh, that's cool. We got plugs everywhere. Okay. I'm going to turn the TV

213
00:32:47,769 --> 00:33:10,500
on and then go read the diary. What does this do? What's going on? A little toothbrush? What's that?

214
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:22,069
Is this a toothbrush? Hey, look at that. It's Mr. Sanderson's toothbrush, but let's take it anyway.

215
00:33:22,069 --> 00:33:27,269
I bet he won't miss it. Now that we have this nifty device, but you can clean all sorts of stains.

216
00:33:28,309 --> 00:33:37,849
Oh, yes. Press X to open the equivalent menu. Like the toothbrush with and use A to hold it.

217
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:45,859
You want to put the toothbrush away. Press B. There's a stain right there. Why don't you give

218
00:33:45,859 --> 00:34:03,900
it a good scrub? Yes. Oh, yes. I'm so happy. I can clean surfaces. Look at all these stains.

219
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:16,920
Over here. I don't even get this dog stain. It's odd if the TV just turned on all by itself.

220
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:32,420
All right. Well, let's go. Can I turn it off? Open the drawer. Chibi. What's the proper way

221
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:52,650
to address Chibi Robo? CR? Chibi? Chibi Robo is too long. Chibs? Robo? Look at that stain right

222
00:34:52,650 --> 00:35:02,199
there. How do I put the stain on the wall? There's a stain right there. How do I get that stain?

223
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:17,429
I can't. How do I do this? Oh, fuck. I'm out of battery. How do I use first person again?

224
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:39,000
Where's the TV? TV's like up here. Hold on. I got another coin over here. Another coin this way.

225
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:45,769
All right. There's a plug. I got a plug. I got to get up to the TV.

226
00:35:47,769 --> 00:36:06,949
Chibi, you're dying. All right. Would you guys take Amazon instant delivery? Like when you clicked

227
00:36:06,949 --> 00:36:13,909
buy, you got it. The technology, like we're at like 10G. Technology with just instantly a drone.

228
00:36:13,909 --> 00:36:19,739
Got it in front of your door when you press buy, right? But this is the noise you hear in your house

229
00:36:19,739 --> 00:36:47,579
24x7. No. That would also be bad. Okay. TV. All right. There's the TV. Don't look at it.

230
00:36:48,599 --> 00:37:02,969
Don't look at it, Chibi Robo. Get away from it. What the hell is that? So confused. So conflicted.

231
00:37:04,329 --> 00:37:11,829
People say evil. People say justice. But what is justice? And what is evil? Do I truly fight

232
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:19,929
on the side of justice? Or am I just a fool, a blind fool? No, I fight on the side of justice.

233
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:24,780
Those who think they can disturb the peace will get a taste of my space fury.

234
00:37:27,369 --> 00:37:43,219
It's I, Super Frog Falcon, space hunter Drake Redcrest. What are you doing here?

235
00:37:44,019 --> 00:38:00,219
Drake Redcrest, you're you're still as sharp as ever. Hi, space hunter Redcrest. Good morning,

236
00:38:00,219 --> 00:38:09,610
Chibi Robo. What's this? No answer, eh? Space Hunter Code Part One. Greet everyone by yelling.

237
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:17,130
Perhaps you have been shocked into silence by the sight of toys moving. Do not be afraid,

238
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:19,769
friend. The toys in this house move and speak when humans aren't around.

239
00:38:20,809 --> 00:38:24,889
Enough talk. It bores Drake Redcrest. Let us be friends, oh diminutive one.

240
00:38:25,849 --> 00:38:30,539
As a friend, it is my duty to inform you that your life appears to need more justice.

241
00:38:32,139 --> 00:38:40,139
Drake Redcrest can solve that problem. Take this special gift. It's just for you.

242
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:56,250
What's in it? Drake Redcrest suit. Um, yep. Have I show you how to don it, friend? Yes, how do I

243
00:38:56,329 --> 00:39:01,610
put this on? Immediately. Your honesty is noble and must be rewarded, therefore Drake Redcrest

244
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:10,039
shall teach you. Next, open the equipment menu. If the chibi gear on the top bar is selected,

245
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:17,719
simply tilt down, I say. Two weeks it will let you access your suits. Is that to select

246
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:25,239
the suit you wanted by person left or right? Oh, what? You can put on costumes?

247
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:33,179
You are a smart one. Ha ha, we shall meet again. But for now, we ride. If you are ever interested

248
00:39:33,179 --> 00:39:38,300
in achieving justice, wear that and speak to me. We shall learn the facts of justice together.

249
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:49,420
I'm just along for the ride. I'm the baby that gets brought to the convention.

250
00:39:51,670 --> 00:40:00,780
Dad's in Superman costume. Mom is superwoman. And I'm also dressed as Superman and with a helmet on

251
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:08,659
and stuff. Take me around to the convention floor. Everyone will be so excited to see me.

252
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:20,630
The way I talk to him again. Space Hunter Drake Redcrest. Okay, so I talk to you again if I want

253
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:27,590
to do justice. Looks good on you, little man. So you wish to fight for truth and justice, eh? Don't

254
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:40,869
lie. I know these things. Yes. That's a specialty of mine. You just sit back and enjoy the ride.

255
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:52,900
All right, let's go to the convention. Hold, stand your ground. Very well, my small metal friend.

256
00:40:54,099 --> 00:41:02,010
I will now administer the test of justice. It'll be long, hard, and a word I don't know.

257
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:08,650
But you must endure no matter the cost. Ready? Then we ride. Mark my word, mark my wealth.

258
00:41:09,369 --> 00:41:20,329
Space Hunter Code Part 2. True justice cannot exist without a pose. You'll never be an agent

259
00:41:20,329 --> 00:41:27,349
of justice unless you master this. Old friend, you must be the one known as television.

260
00:41:29,179 --> 00:41:42,630
Oh, how did you know my name? You laugh a lot. Ha ha ha. I could scream, but I don't want to.

261
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:51,500
That's justice 101, my flying metal friend. Wow, that's impressive. We're about to enter

262
00:41:51,500 --> 00:42:00,010
dangerous skies here. You must fly back. Are you ready? Here's the skinny. When I start to pose,

263
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:09,769
press Z immediately. Easy as pie, right? Sure. Press Z immediately when he starts posing.

264
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:22,170
You can do it, Chibi-Robo. Okay, here we go. I did it. Too slow. Curses and blasts. Try it again.

265
00:42:22,889 --> 00:42:41,059
Space Hunter Drake Red Crest. I learned the pose. That's fantastic. You're the best, Chibi-Robo.

266
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:52,010
Ah, stupendously done, Chibi-Robo. I mean, Space Hunter Robo. I am now proud to appoint you as the

267
00:42:52,010 --> 00:43:00,340
universe's 99th space hunter. Climb the rankings and assassinate the other 98 space hunters to

268
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:13,849
reach number one assassin. Oh, I got 19 happy points for that and 100 bucks. Spread the happiness.

269
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:21,670
You mastered Drake Red Crest Z action. Show everyone what you can do with it.

270
00:43:22,309 --> 00:43:28,309
I just have a pose in front of people. Think of justice when you wear this. You're around, Hunter.

271
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:43,559
Wait, what? Oh, I'm just showing it to him. Space Hunter Drake Red Crest. Hello, Space Hunter Robo.

272
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:48,920
Your excitement is indeed impressive, but it seems that the living room is currently in a state of

273
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:57,099
broccoli-ism. That is a word, right? Of course it is. Irregardlessness,

274
00:43:57,099 --> 00:44:01,179
I shall lead you in charge of tomorrow's patrol, Space Hunter Chibi-Robo.

275
00:44:02,059 --> 00:44:09,980
Let's clean up. Wait, doesn't... All right, the person over here with the diary. Should I do the

276
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:15,420
pose? I'm going to freak this person out. They're going to think, look, this is a reverse disguise.

277
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:36,099
Ready? Who it is? Hey, what do you think about this? Oh, my. What's that sound? That's handsome

278
00:44:36,099 --> 00:44:46,230
sound. Drake Red Crest. Oh, my gosh. You patrol really good. Sophie, no, that was so stupid.

279
00:44:46,230 --> 00:45:04,340
What's up with her? What the fuck is going on over here in chat?

280
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:14,360
Put it in sub-only. Put it in sub-only. We got to... Come on. What is this horse shit? Sub-only. Let's go.

281
00:45:20,219 --> 00:45:21,340
Let's get it in sub-only.

282
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:29,079
We good? We good. Okay. What the fuck?

283
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:39,619
All right, it's... We're back. All right, now we can go into the kitchen.

284
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:55,940
But no, we can't. I got to plug in first. Imagine eating ass. Imagine.

285
00:46:00,219 --> 00:46:02,300
You're fully recharged. Now, yes, I'd love to save.

286
00:46:06,469 --> 00:46:08,789
How many costumes are there in the game? I feel like this should be a lot.

287
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:28,010
I need to collect at least four of them. I want to be free. Don't worry, you will be soon.

288
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:37,000
In fact... All right, you know what? Put it in follow-only mode instead.

289
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:41,559
But follow-only... You got to be followed the channel for at least what? Like 30 minutes,

290
00:46:41,559 --> 00:46:50,519
something like that. Follow-only. Let's see if that works. It's always in follow-only, but...

291
00:46:51,639 --> 00:46:58,550
Length of time, though. One day follow-only, maybe? One year follow-only. I don't know about

292
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:18,170
that one. No, I got to clean. Hold on. You can't even do that. I like cleaning with a toothbrush.

293
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:21,820
Remember, you're almost at 10 million views. What do I have right now?

294
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:29,079
TV Robo, all of your hard work has made Mrs. Sanderson happy, happy, happy.

295
00:47:30,679 --> 00:47:33,639
You see, she's given me a bunch of bonus happy points in Moolah.

296
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:39,429
And when you clean enough, I can give you a nice little cleaning bonus.

297
00:47:39,429 --> 00:47:43,750
MonkaS, what's he doing? Your happy point bonus is...

298
00:47:44,949 --> 00:47:53,530
8 happy points. That doesn't seem like very much. 10 million... What am I? 9,995,000 views? Holy shit.

299
00:47:56,789 --> 00:48:11,429
9,995,000. Well, come on, guys. Tell your friends. Spread the infection. Lick the germs.

300
00:48:12,619 --> 00:48:16,380
Tell everybody that you know to check out this stream. Get us over 10 million.

301
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:26,650
Pog, we're doing it today. We're doing it today. Am I doing it right? How do I clean stuff on the

302
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:34,090
walls? Fuck, I'm almost out of battery. Come here. I got a lot of... Wait, there's a plug right here,

303
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:49,670
right? Oh, fuck. There's no plug here. What does the 10 millionth viewer get?

304
00:48:53,289 --> 00:49:03,210
There's no way to tell. There's no way to tell who is the 10 million viewer. This isn't a radio station.

305
00:49:15,349 --> 00:49:21,420
Breambin, thanks for five community subs, Breambin. Appreciate it. Thanks for the five subs.

306
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:27,460
Community subs. I want to get that frog coin in there. Yeah, I'm going to call it frog coins

307
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:34,409
because I love Super Mario RPG, Legend of the Seven Stars. I want to get up there. There's so

308
00:49:34,409 --> 00:49:46,099
much to do. All right. Let's trash, trash. Throw the trash away. Play Bowser's Inside Story. LOL.

309
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:51,940
That's as good as Super Mario RPG, Legend of the Seven Stars. It probably isn't. No, it probably

310
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:56,179
isn't, but it's still probably just as good. It's my favorite game I ever made, but it's

311
00:49:56,179 --> 00:50:06,659
going to be hard to top it. Five community subs from Jamie. Thank you, Jamie. Thanks a lot for the

312
00:50:06,659 --> 00:50:15,289
sub. Oh, what's the candy wrapper? Five points. I got a lot of money.

313
00:50:20,789 --> 00:50:26,519
10 millionth viewer gets a dork cube, but there's no way to tell who the 10 million viewer is.

314
00:50:27,639 --> 00:50:40,090
You can't. There's no way for me to tell. All right, I want to get up there.

315
00:50:44,599 --> 00:50:51,030
I can plug into this guy and give this guy power. All Sub-Aleem mode does is just give

316
00:50:51,030 --> 00:51:02,460
plebs extra space for sub points. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I gotta

317
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:13,769
make that more money. I have to make that more money. What do I do? Charge him? Oh, is this a

318
00:51:13,769 --> 00:51:24,550
small door? That's odd. I have no info on it in my memory bank. What's in here? What the fuck? Look

319
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:34,199
at all this money. Whoa. There's a little secret, uh, charging power money station.

320
00:51:37,269 --> 00:51:45,110
Imagine paying five dollars a month to type poop dick. Um, that you don't think that's worth it.

321
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:54,260
Dum dee dum dee dum. Hey, since this small door has your eyes, let's call it a chibi door.

322
00:51:54,820 --> 00:52:12,949
Guys, I got a lot of money. It's so, it's so simple. If I say one thing, you guys, it's so

323
00:52:12,949 --> 00:52:24,119
simple. Everyone just starts saying it. Okay. We didn't do an experiment. I'm going to say

324
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:42,409
something and you're going to repeat it. Okay. Celery. Celery. I love celery. Celery. Interesting.

325
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:59,639
Interesting. Sailboat. I was in a sailboat one day and I love sailboat. Sailboat. Sailboat.

326
00:52:59,639 --> 00:53:21,369
Sailboat. Cleaning bonus. Nice. Okay. Let's now subscribe. Subscribe.

327
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:26,230
Subscription. Subscription service.

328
00:53:32,869 --> 00:53:41,800
Nice. Okay. You do. All right. You guys are good. Yep. I saw scam like 10,000 times.

329
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:50,789
All right. I got, you guys, you guys can resist. Sell out. Selling out.

330
00:53:51,190 --> 00:54:13,849
Sell out. Best stream. Stream I'm on currently. That is the best stream. Best stream. And don't

331
00:54:13,849 --> 00:54:31,340
stop saying it. Best stream. You fuckers. I didn't see once my name. I didn't see one time.

332
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:45,900
Really? Not even once? Let's try another one. Poopoo. I want to have that one. Poopoo.

333
00:54:46,059 --> 00:55:07,420
Poopoo. I wanted people to write that one. You guys are fucked. He's an egomaniac.

334
00:55:12,519 --> 00:55:28,920
Well, in this industry you gotta be. Can I climb this? Can I? Maybe I can float.

335
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:38,460
This is exactly why I don't like Twitch. Wait. What? I can float over here.

336
00:55:42,969 --> 00:55:55,210
Got it. Yes. Can I climb here? Oh, we can go up the whole thing. Play better. What? I just did

337
00:55:55,210 --> 00:56:00,730
something good. Now I can float from here. Is there another coin up here? Oh, I can turn the

338
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:10,730
light off. All right. Turn the light off. Oh no. I can go up. Derma lied about the frog coin. Thanks

339
00:56:10,730 --> 00:56:21,030
for the what? Thanks for the subs. What do you do? What? What does that even mean? All right. We're

340
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:25,989
up here. Ooh. There's another chibi door. All right. Put this shit away. Come here. Is there a plug?

341
00:56:26,469 --> 00:56:40,179
Oh. I almost died. Look at all this. Okay. Wait. Let's charge up. Wait. This is going to take a

342
00:56:40,179 --> 00:56:51,849
lot of energy. How much is it going to take? It's okay. There's money in here. It's a lot of money.

343
00:56:53,369 --> 00:56:58,550
All right. I can't clean anything up here yet. Should I knock this off? I'm going to knock this

344
00:56:58,550 --> 00:57:29,659
off. Push it off. Right? Should I push this off? There's probably something in here. It went too

345
00:57:29,659 --> 00:57:38,900
far. What's it doing? It's a funeral? Oh, chibi robo. Look at the state you're in. I thought maybe

346
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:56,659
we could make it to the top of the chibi ranking together. Is that it? Oh, I can move. Oh, you're

347
00:57:56,659 --> 00:58:03,860
alive. I was worried sick. Remember, you're a robot. If your energy ever drops to zero, you'll

348
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:08,420
switch off just like that. Watch your charge and use an outlet if you have to recharge.

349
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:12,420
Oh, and you should know, if you ever pass out like that again, don't get too worried.

350
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:17,940
Your faithful friend, Television, that's me, will carry you back to the chibi house.

351
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:25,860
Oh, another thing. If you press X and select remove, you'll change out of your trauma suit.

352
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:34,340
Oh, it looks like you lost some moolah. What? Don't look at me. Oh no, you lose money.

353
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:41,460
If you're a robo, you can buy chibi batteries from the online shop now. They'll come in handy,

354
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:47,619
I think. If you get one of these, you can recover just enough energy to go in and recharge yourself.

355
00:58:50,889 --> 00:58:55,610
Pick one up and try it out. I'm definitely upgraded.

356
00:58:59,659 --> 00:59:08,900
I'm in the top 25,000. We're making it into the top 100,000. Citrus Soft has sent you a

357
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:15,559
special gift, a brand new bonus battery. Would you look at that? Your battery power went up 100.

358
00:59:19,079 --> 00:59:28,570
Oh, nice. I need 21 more happy points. All right, they wanted me to buy something.

359
00:59:30,329 --> 00:59:44,920
I'm sure we can save. From Soft? All right, take it off. Stop bowling. All right, get it off. Stop

360
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:56,809
bowling. Okay, chibi battery. All right, I can buy the blaster or a battery. Can I get a battery?

361
00:59:59,269 --> 01:00:06,730
Why were we on sub only? Because there was some fucking plots.

362
01:00:08,039 --> 01:00:13,340
Trying to eat that, you know what I mean? All right, so here we go. Blaster,

363
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:18,539
chibi blaster. It allows you to fire sonic blasts. Got it.

364
01:00:18,539 --> 01:00:24,500
I don't have any more money.

365
01:00:30,679 --> 01:00:43,289
Thank you for your visit. So now I have a gun. Okay, put it down, put it down, put it down,

366
01:00:43,289 --> 01:00:49,659
put it down. Aim that at me, you stupid. You've upgraded. Keep it up, chibi robo. Let's go.

367
01:00:50,539 --> 01:01:26,969
Freedom, freedom. Sub only forever. Did I take it off? There we go. Okay, welcome back. All right,

368
01:01:26,969 --> 01:01:41,260
I want to do, I want to get back up there. Released from pleb storage.

369
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:59,539
Pleb storage. All right, that's funny. Press Z? What just happened? I just took like 400 damage.

370
01:01:59,539 --> 01:02:14,389
I don't have any trash. Why would you, what's the point of that? Oh, excuse me.

371
01:02:16,469 --> 01:02:25,369
All right, let's put a hole in the door, right? We can go chibi blaster. Okay, and fire.

372
01:02:31,239 --> 01:02:44,599
Why am I hurt? Because I fell off the top of the building, whatever it was.

373
01:02:44,599 --> 01:02:53,050
Yikes. Didn't do it. Wasn't me. Don't deactivate me. We're in the backyard. They've welcomed you

374
01:02:53,050 --> 01:03:03,269
into their home. It's so cute. I love it. Oh, you can do first person. Oh, wow.

375
01:03:05,929 --> 01:03:13,610
Okay, don't. It's Donald Duck? All right, plug this in. Put this away.

376
01:03:18,889 --> 01:03:34,519
All right, I need an outlet back here. I love these little chibi doors.

377
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:50,170
Is there outlets outside? Probably not. There's so many things to do. I have so many jobs to do.

378
01:03:50,170 --> 01:04:01,420
I need outlet. How would they be outlet outside? I know, I know, I know. I'll get in a second.

379
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:19,300
I have to leave. 27 stains. Happy point bonuses. 14. I have outdoor outlets. Yeah, you can have

380
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:24,730
outdoor. That's not out of the ordinary. Your very presence makes everyone happy.

381
01:04:26,170 --> 01:04:32,309
Okay. All right. All right. All right. Pick up this. Let's go. Plug in. I need an outlet. I need an

382
01:04:32,309 --> 01:04:46,199
outlet. Outlet. Outlet. Outlet. The nearest outlet is... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

383
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:57,929
Okay, there's one over here. I almost pressed Z. I almost just hit my head on the ground.

384
01:04:58,489 --> 01:05:04,260
Well, it's almost time to go home anyways. All right, here's an outlet. Wait, was that lied to?

385
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:16,090
An outlet right here? What was that lied to? Where is it? Where is it?

386
01:05:25,559 --> 01:05:37,559
Is it up? Where is it? Oh, fuck. It's up there, huh? Uh-oh. What do you mean blind? Behind what?

387
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:54,739
Behind this? No, that's up. What do you mean blind? It's apparently up here. Is it behind this?

388
01:05:54,739 --> 01:06:14,539
Um, Chibi-Robo, did you just hear that totally weird sound? Yes, I did.

389
01:06:17,739 --> 01:06:21,980
I heard a strange noise coming from the far side of the foyer. I'm scared.

390
01:06:26,119 --> 01:06:39,400
Wait, there's... Okay, there is one behind here. There's one right here. It's dead.

391
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:56,119
It's a fart. I'll never get over that, will I? Okay, let's go.

392
01:06:59,909 --> 01:07:05,110
All right, so there's one back there. Did I pick up any? I didn't pick up any trash.

393
01:07:05,110 --> 01:07:14,780
Almost time to go to bed. The coin? Here's a list of your nominees. Can we remove that?

394
01:07:17,079 --> 01:07:22,119
Oh, I gotta cancel SurveyMonkey. All right. Yeah, what has it been? Like three months? All right.

395
01:07:24,170 --> 01:07:43,880
All right. Yeah. Oh, trash. Get behind this? No. All right, we're about to go to bed. I should have.

396
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:52,250
I think I upgraded. Fringe streamer won't use SurveyMonkey. What the hell do you want me to use

397
01:07:52,250 --> 01:08:04,139
it for right now? It's coming from the foyer again. Yeah, well, I don't have time to investigate. It's

398
01:08:04,139 --> 01:08:18,710
time for bed. Fringe. He said it, guys. It's a stupid word. I can say it. All right. What's

399
01:08:18,710 --> 01:08:25,750
left in here? Can I go back up? I want to go up here. You know what I mean? I want to go up there.

400
01:08:26,470 --> 01:08:34,220
I gotta climb up the thing, the lamp, like I did before, and then I have to fly over here. That's

401
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:54,439
what I'm doing tomorrow. Blaster cleans wall stains. Really? All right. I got a lot of happy points.

402
01:08:55,880 --> 01:09:14,279
Good morning. Let's adjust your happy points. New ranking. Top 1000. Top 10,000.

403
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:27,180
I'm going to wait for a battery now. 120 battery points. Those other cheapy robos

404
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:34,229
are just paperweights. I am the number one. I need 200. Okay, this is where the game really

405
01:09:34,229 --> 01:09:44,550
opens up here. Cross small gaps. Use the cheapy copter. Really, all you have to do is press A.

406
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:52,819
That makes you fly horizontal for a little while. Thank you. And we have an alert. What is this?

407
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:59,779
Secretly developing an all new brand of cheapy gear. Isn't that exciting?

408
01:10:05,220 --> 01:10:14,380
10 million? Wait, did it happen? Did I really pass 10 million views on Twitch?

409
01:10:22,739 --> 01:10:32,939
Let's see. There it is. 10 million. 331. Hey. Hey, everybody. 10 million.

410
01:10:37,819 --> 01:10:57,670
Base reveal. The wing came in. Thanks to the 10 million views, guys. That's a lot of people that

411
01:10:57,670 --> 01:11:17,289
have clicked on the stream. That's a lot of clicks. We need a speech. Let's get to 25 million. That's

412
01:11:17,289 --> 01:11:32,840
a new milestone. 25 million views. What a speech. Dude, 10 million views. Give us a speech. What a

413
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:51,479
milestone. Get me to 25 million. Okay. Anything else? No. You're welcome. Thanks. All right.

414
01:11:53,079 --> 01:12:03,699
Seriously, give an Animal Crossing speech. That's it. Can I do anything else with the family?

415
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:13,909
Animal Crossing. All right. I'm going to the foyer. Where's the foyer? We need to do...

416
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:18,859
All right. To the foyer. There's a sound coming from the foyer. Let's do it.

417
01:12:19,739 --> 01:12:40,409
Do a credit card reveal. Hey, guys. You got the 10 million views. Here's all my credit cards.

418
01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:57,260
Hey, who's that? Hex Frisco. Yes, sir. I want to report immediately. What is that thing?

419
01:12:58,460 --> 01:13:05,739
Omitted intruder, sir. I think it came from the living room, sir. From a form of perimeter, man.

420
01:13:06,699 --> 01:13:36,220
Yes, sir. Go, go, go. Defensive positions. There's a lot more than I thought there was. M&Ms.

421
01:13:38,460 --> 01:14:02,939
Nice move. What the fuck was that for? He just killed that guy. An unauthorized intruder has

422
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:08,859
entered the area. Free ranger's pride is at stake. Stop the intruder or I'll make you egg salad.

423
01:14:09,659 --> 01:14:14,819
If he comes into range, let him have it. Don't let your guard down, men.

424
01:14:21,350 --> 01:14:26,149
Um, I just look for a plug. T.B. Robo, this isn't good.

425
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:30,710
No. Yes, it's not good. Wait. No, it isn't good. Or yes, it's not good.

426
01:14:31,829 --> 01:14:36,390
It's kind of a hard way to answer that question. This isn't good. Yes, it isn't good. Yes, that's

427
01:14:36,390 --> 01:14:49,399
yes, it is not good. Okay. Strange sound is coming from over there. It'll be really hard

428
01:14:49,399 --> 01:15:03,859
to get over there. These rangers mean business. Okay. Well, then so do I. Don't think I mean

429
01:15:03,859 --> 01:15:15,989
business too. This is okay. Let's put it away. First person mode is here. Well, how do I go

430
01:15:15,989 --> 01:15:34,869
to first person? I can't go to first person. Z? You can't move and go FPS. It's not Z.

431
01:15:35,989 --> 01:15:44,899
It's why? Why? Why? Why? Okay. Okay. Hold on. I'll just plug in.

432
01:15:44,899 --> 01:16:08,060
All right. Now they're fucking dead. Just stay plugged in.

433
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:12,859
And where's the extension cord? Why can't I just stay plugged into the wall?

434
01:16:14,649 --> 01:16:26,539
Uh, I don't need to save right now. All right. Why? Where is it? Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All

435
01:16:26,539 --> 01:16:46,729
right. Let's go. Let's go FPS these guys. Here we go. Unauthorized intruder. Don't let him pass.

436
01:16:48,229 --> 01:16:58,380
Take him out. T.B. Robo, this isn't good. Yes, it isn't good. It's going to be really hard to

437
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:02,859
get over there. You'll never get through unless you find something you can use to cover yourself.

438
01:17:16,489 --> 01:17:20,489
Okay. Literally impossible. Literally impossible. Literally impossible without a new item.

439
01:17:28,489 --> 01:17:34,060
This action is physically impossible. It's not possible. T.B. Robo, you can't do it. I get

440
01:17:34,060 --> 01:17:43,720
yelled at every time I go. All right. Physically impossible without a shield. Run? That's physically

441
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:48,600
impossible. The television told me. Everything you see on the television that comes out of the

442
01:17:48,600 --> 01:18:10,020
television's mouth is real. You can't move while in first person. I want to do the thing I wanted

443
01:18:10,020 --> 01:18:20,420
to do before. I want to go up over this way. Oh, look. This is up there. Okay. So I want to go.

444
01:18:20,420 --> 01:18:26,100
Oh, I love this game. Okay. We're going to go up there. Up the lamp. Over there. Open the secret

445
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:49,289
door. We're going to fall on the top of the couch. Grab the coins. What a good game. Get up there.

446
01:18:54,279 --> 01:19:13,899
Boy, mate. Turn on the telly. All right. Put it away. Let's go. Now, can I get that door again?

447
01:19:14,539 --> 01:19:22,920
Anything from here that I can do? Wait, what's that? Can I climb that?

448
01:19:24,439 --> 01:19:45,720
Maybe. Whoa, whoa, whoa. That's not solid. I thought this shit was solid.

449
01:19:53,979 --> 01:20:01,000
Jump over it. What's the problem? Let's get this money again.

450
01:20:11,350 --> 01:20:18,649
Fuck it. Okay. I already got it. It was a permanent. Okay. Because it took the money.

451
01:20:18,649 --> 01:20:23,850
All right. From here, what am I doing? I got to get a good look. I'm going to push this down.

452
01:20:23,850 --> 01:20:36,060
I'm not going to fuck this up this time. Okay. Walk down. Now, I'm going to float from here

453
01:20:37,180 --> 01:20:55,239
over there. Can I make it? Float down? What was in the box? All right. What was in the box?

454
01:20:55,800 --> 01:21:27,079
What was in the box? D-Squad. What? I didn't, I thought I was, I didn't even know what was

455
01:21:27,079 --> 01:21:39,000
supposed to be in it. All right. Can't return this way. All right. No for you. We're going to

456
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:57,159
the kitchen. Kitchen time. Say hi to the frog girl. I already did. All right. We're going to

457
01:21:57,159 --> 01:22:11,270
the kitchen. Turn around. Can I go in the kitchen yet? Is the kitchen open? I guess so. Oh yeah. The

458
01:22:11,270 --> 01:22:29,670
puppet thing was in here. Kitchen. What we got? Oh no. Just being eaten alive by the dog.

459
01:22:30,390 --> 01:22:43,989
What's a dog toy? That's okay. It's a dog toy. That makes sense. That's a dog toy.

460
01:22:44,630 --> 01:23:10,600
Let's plug it in. Dogs are friends. Does it make her any less human? Well, if you're a dog toy,

461
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:31,109
that means you are not a human. You are a stuffed dog toy. Crash. Can I get, can I crawl?

462
01:23:32,390 --> 01:23:40,659
Oh, whoa. This is the dog's bed. Wait, hold on. How do I get up here? I can't get up there.

463
01:23:41,380 --> 01:23:45,939
There's a box and there's like a necklace up there. All right. Well, I, I, I get it later.

464
01:23:46,819 --> 01:24:00,489
Little track. Can I open it? I can open this thing up for her. Can this be opened? Nope.

465
01:24:00,489 --> 01:24:06,470
Are you talking to the dog? What's the dog going to say?

466
01:24:10,119 --> 01:24:35,609
Tao. Not in the house. Yipe. Yipe. Climb the chair. Oh, can I peel the sticker off?

467
01:24:36,170 --> 01:24:58,390
Or can I shoot the sticker off? Uh-huh. Let's get up here. There's a gold coin. A new spot.

468
01:24:58,550 --> 01:25:08,359
To find trinkets. It's shit. What's up here? Oh, what am I going to do? Okay. I can grab that.

469
01:25:09,159 --> 01:25:24,300
Can I not grab that? I can't grab like the yarn. There we go. Keep going. What else is over here?

470
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:42,140
All right. Get on this. No! Oh, what's the, what's the point of being on the towel? Wait,

471
01:25:42,140 --> 01:25:55,130
what does it want to do with the milk? Oh, this trash. Okay. Toaster. Do I make toast?

472
01:25:56,409 --> 01:26:03,220
Did I plug into the toaster? Come on. I've got to be able to do something with the toaster.

473
01:26:03,939 --> 01:26:10,970
All right. This time I'm not going to push that off yet because I know I'm going to need it.

474
01:26:11,850 --> 01:26:28,199
Right? Let's keep going up while I still have power. What is all the way up here? Oh, there's

475
01:26:28,199 --> 01:26:50,069
a door. There's a demon door up here. Can I grab onto the clock? Let's go. Pretty high too. Nice.

476
01:26:52,649 --> 01:27:05,380
All right. Now let's, I want to take a look. Mug. Spoon. Dog tags. Okay. I could float from here to

477
01:27:05,380 --> 01:27:12,229
there and get the dog tags. I could go get the spoon. There's a bandage. There's a frog ring.

478
01:27:12,869 --> 01:27:22,100
Go to mom. All right. I got to go from here to there. All right. Let's make it. Let's go. Let's

479
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:32,199
go. I need an outlet. Can I grab this thing when it comes back around? Can I jump onto the clock?

480
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:40,649
Or should I just float from here to there? I don't know. I'm, this is kind of freaking me out.

481
01:27:41,210 --> 01:27:44,869
Can I hold onto it? All right. Let's go. Hurry up. What's the fast forward time button?

482
01:27:50,140 --> 01:28:15,180
Jump in the toaster. Hey, can I grab it? Grab the, grab it. I can't grab it. Toaster. I need a

483
01:28:15,180 --> 01:28:23,140
battery. I need a plug. I need a plug. I need a plug. I need a plug. Where's the plugs in here?

484
01:28:23,859 --> 01:28:27,060
I need a plug right now. Come on. There's got to be an outlet over here. Ah.

485
01:28:27,939 --> 01:28:44,199
Where's the, okay. There's a plug across. Oh, fuck. Um, all right. I'm going to go for it.

486
01:28:45,590 --> 01:29:07,239
I don't, I'm dead. I can't make that shit. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

487
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:27,670
How do I, I just did so much stuff. I'm not going to move. Time's going to run out. Go to the plug.

488
01:29:27,670 --> 01:29:47,529
I can't make it. Five, four. Oh, I can make it. Yes. Oh yes. Ah, I didn't know if I could make it.

489
01:29:51,989 --> 01:29:58,649
Stop dying. I've only died once. I've only died one time. Come on. Stop dying in plies. I've died

490
01:29:58,649 --> 01:30:25,850
like five times. What the fuck was that? Where did that come from? Oh, am I all right? I fell off.

491
01:30:25,850 --> 01:30:36,710
All right. Well, I already got this one, right? Yeah, I got that coming in. Can I get and let's

492
01:30:36,710 --> 01:30:52,060
talk to mom in the few minutes we have left. What about the dog poop? Can I talk to mom?

493
01:30:52,060 --> 01:31:10,699
I'm busy right now, Tao. It's me. Boy, I can climb this. These little lips. Oh, that's it.

494
01:31:11,579 --> 01:31:24,819
Wait. Grr. Grr. Be quiet, Tao. If I can get up there. Look out.

495
01:31:24,819 --> 01:31:34,279
That was close. You almost hurt yourself. What? You be careful, Chibo. I was trying to figure

496
01:31:34,279 --> 01:32:01,180
out what people call him. It's Chibo. Mug. Oh, Chibo. I'm sorry for saying you were a waste of

497
01:32:01,180 --> 01:32:07,260
moolah on Jenny's birthday. I'm making my husband sleep on the sofa until he's sorry for what he

498
01:32:07,260 --> 01:32:11,659
did. What? I thought you just said sorry to me. Don't worry about it. It's his fault, not yours.

499
01:32:12,539 --> 01:32:30,310
Mug. My mug. That's a Drake Red Crest mug. Cool. Chibo, that belongs to my husband. I don't know if...

500
01:32:30,310 --> 01:32:37,829
Oh, forget it. Go ahead and take it. He's got so much Drake Red Crest stuff. He'll never know I

501
01:32:37,829 --> 01:32:52,869
gave something away. Get rid of this fruit. It flies everywhere, mom. Come on. Really? Disgusting.

502
01:32:53,590 --> 01:33:04,699
All right. I got like 10 seconds before this is over. We'll collect a few coins. Turn the stove on.

503
01:33:09,130 --> 01:33:21,220
Can I turn on the stove? Turn all burners on. I guess I can climb it. Can I not climb that?

504
01:33:25,420 --> 01:33:48,170
It's a ladder? It is a ladder. All right. Should I get this thing? The ladle? A pan? Wait. A fan up

505
01:33:48,170 --> 01:33:56,180
here. Oh, I can clean this. There's oil up here. All right. Give me the cleaning brush. Nice.

506
01:33:56,819 --> 01:34:18,569
Oh, look. More oil. That's it? There's a little more. That was a tough one. Any more oil? Hey,

507
01:34:18,569 --> 01:34:26,579
Lord Repta. Lord Repta, thanks for the five community subs. And also Bitslave gave another

508
01:34:26,579 --> 01:34:36,149
$50. So Bitslave is at 10,000 bits today, which is fucking crazy. A lot of money, Bitslave.

509
01:34:37,109 --> 01:34:41,829
Bitslave says, do you have any plans on Majora's Mask or Wind Waker? Maybe both. I do not.

510
01:34:44,390 --> 01:34:55,340
I do not have a plan to play any Zelda games. I'm sorry to say. Well, plan on it.

511
01:34:59,500 --> 01:35:05,420
I don't know. Look, I got all this to do first. I got Mario Sunshine to do first. That's priority

512
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:11,739
number one. I was slowly going up the rankings now, not as fast as it was before.

513
01:35:21,369 --> 01:35:26,069
I also played those old Zelda games when they first came out.

514
01:35:29,609 --> 01:35:32,329
I did Ocarina of Time. I don't think I ever beat Majora's Mask.

515
01:35:42,710 --> 01:35:56,039
All right. Okay. I'm going to say something. I'm going to say something.

516
01:35:58,949 --> 01:36:07,239
This is a real, real opinion that everybody's going to hate me for.

517
01:36:07,960 --> 01:36:19,270
I think I've said this before on stream. Zelda games, although I respect everything they've done

518
01:36:19,270 --> 01:36:27,930
for the industry, I respect it as a series. I understand why people love it. They don't do it

519
01:36:27,930 --> 01:36:37,460
for me. Zelda games don't do it for me. That's it. Of course I know everything. It's an incredible,

520
01:36:37,460 --> 01:36:44,600
incredible series. It just doesn't really do it for me. That's it.

521
01:36:44,600 --> 01:37:00,409
That's it. Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong. I've played through all of Ocarina of Time

522
01:37:00,409 --> 01:37:07,449
and it is fantastic. It's very, very good, but I'm just not into them. I'm just not into

523
01:37:07,449 --> 01:37:11,369
Zelda games. I'm just not into them. I'm sorry. I know. I'm sorry, but I'm going to be truthful

524
01:37:11,369 --> 01:37:20,710
with you guys. I'm not going to lie to you. Now, that wasn't a wink to tell you. Just kidding.

525
01:37:20,710 --> 01:37:24,310
This is a joke that I actually do love the whole series and I played all the time. That's a wink

526
01:37:24,310 --> 01:37:35,960
because somebody paid 75,000 channel points. Breath of the Wild, that'll change your mind. Yes,

527
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:40,520
now Breath of the Wild is a different story, I think. I probably would really, really like that

528
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:56,300
game. Something fell. Look, it's the chibi-robo-chibi manual. All right, well, what is it?

529
01:37:57,180 --> 01:38:08,970
Breath of the Wild sucks, in my opinion. Everything I've seen of it, it seems more my jam.

530
01:38:08,970 --> 01:38:15,510
It seems more my style. We'll probably end up playing that at some point. I'm certain

531
01:38:15,510 --> 01:38:18,710
I would probably really love it. I've already stored this in my memory banks, but I think

532
01:38:18,710 --> 01:38:27,130
you should read it. Okay, let's read it. Chibi manual. Thank you for purchasing chibi-robo,

533
01:38:27,130 --> 01:38:33,529
a member of the Citrus Soft Robotics family. We appreciate your support. Chapter one book.

534
01:38:35,479 --> 01:38:42,409
All right, well, this is just the game manual. Welcome to the family. Welcome to the family,

535
01:38:43,289 --> 01:38:58,869
can I get on his hand? All right, get on it. You're missing Laura. No, I want to get back in the

536
01:38:58,869 --> 01:39:09,460
kitchen. All right, back to the kitchen. Oh, let's log in after the kitchen. I've still got to get

537
01:39:09,460 --> 01:39:36,649
up there too. Put his hand in water. You've recharged 15 times. Are you going to save?

538
01:39:36,649 --> 01:39:51,609
What is that saying? I'm doing two? I'm overcharging? Ribbit robot squad. All right,

539
01:39:51,609 --> 01:39:57,140
now I'm going to go into. All right, let's clean up this shit because look at this dog

540
01:39:57,140 --> 01:40:16,939
shit all over the place. Lord mega law, Lord mega law. You only have 50 charging cycles left.

541
01:40:18,300 --> 01:40:36,890
All right, now is the dog sleeping in here? Oh, where's the dog? Clearly no dog in there.

542
01:40:36,890 --> 01:40:53,850
Yeah. Well, wait a minute. What a fucking mess. It's a sound. I'm busy cleaning.

543
01:40:53,850 --> 01:41:13,699
This is just easy happy points. It's like 10, 20 happy points. There's a little cleaning bot.

544
01:41:13,699 --> 01:41:18,579
All right, now you're the blaster. Does this actually work? Was I being lied to?

545
01:41:20,020 --> 01:41:34,300
Sorry, I was a lie. Chibi robot, please. Jesus Christ. What is this? Frog? What's a frog bus?

546
01:41:35,020 --> 01:41:48,539
Okay. Nice. Yeah. All right. That's a good image. It's the bus story. Yeah.

547
01:41:51,779 --> 01:42:19,340
Um, I will. Wait, what's this? Why is it all me? And by the way, the frog was a lot further away,

548
01:42:19,340 --> 01:42:30,489
at least 200 feet away from the bus stop. All right, I need a battery pack charging station,

549
01:42:30,489 --> 01:42:46,380
which is over here. And then I'm going back up. I'm going up to the top. This world is a

550
01:42:46,380 --> 01:42:54,489
journalist world. Awesome. The guy was going so crazy. He was doing so many movements.

551
01:42:55,449 --> 01:43:05,079
I need to go explore over here in the kitchen. Oh, look it. She's on the counter.

552
01:43:05,079 --> 01:43:12,220
I gotta go visit. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Quest, quest, quest. Give me a mission. Give me something

553
01:43:12,220 --> 01:43:38,789
to do. Hello. What do you got? Just thinking about being near Drake makes me nervous. That's why

554
01:43:38,789 --> 01:43:44,390
there's no way I can confess. After all, I'm just a woman who gets used as a dog's plaything. I'm

555
01:43:44,390 --> 01:44:07,960
nothing. Jesus. Drake? Oh my, you're here to see me, you little old bee. Wait a second.

556
01:44:09,140 --> 01:44:19,399
You're much smaller than Drake. Is that you, Chibi Robo? Uh oh. Uh, no. Uh, do I know? Yes.

557
01:44:19,399 --> 01:44:31,000
What should I say? Busted. No, it's not me. It's, it's Drake. No, it's not. No, it's me,

558
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:38,020
Drake. You can't fool me. Drake is much too manly to be so small. Don't startle me like that.

559
01:44:38,579 --> 01:44:56,359
All right, let's say yes. Drake? Oh my, you're here to see me? You're much smaller than Drake.

560
01:44:56,359 --> 01:45:07,189
Is that you, Chibi Robo? Yeah, it's me. Whatever. I want to go this way because there's probably

561
01:45:07,189 --> 01:45:09,909
something else I can do over here. There's coins. There's fish over here too. Can I feed the fish?

562
01:45:10,550 --> 01:45:24,600
What can I do? You want to give something to the fish? Cookie crumbs. Cookies? Let's give

563
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:42,789
cookies. Cookie crumbs? You got 16 happy points. Wow. And they paid me 16 bucks.

564
01:45:44,760 --> 01:45:54,979
Are there any more cookies? Would I like a twig? Should I put a twig in here? I mean,

565
01:45:54,979 --> 01:46:00,949
maybe a little more environment stuff. No, they can't eat that. All right, well, I'm not gonna

566
01:46:00,949 --> 01:46:13,340
give them trash. What does this do? Okay, let's keep going. There's more. There's a bug over here.

567
01:46:14,140 --> 01:46:27,369
Let's charge up. Fish love trash. Um, I, no, nothing else.

568
01:46:30,779 --> 01:46:43,479
Am I gonna save? No, no need. Is it a jar of honey? Oh, okay, there's another demon door over there.

569
01:46:44,279 --> 01:46:48,739
What is, what about this? Pick up the honey. Pick up the jar.

570
01:46:49,699 --> 01:46:56,260
This is coins. Ooh, that's a demon door. All right, hold on. Let me, I gotta get up here.

571
01:46:57,060 --> 01:47:10,819
I can't climb that. Oh, but I can't climb this can of beans or whatever this is. No way.

572
01:47:11,939 --> 01:47:31,899
I know the sound. Shit, I can't get up there. I have to go up this way. Um, hold on. Let me see.

573
01:47:33,500 --> 01:47:40,939
If I go up here, I can. Okay, wait, there's a spoon up there. There's a spoon. All right,

574
01:47:40,939 --> 01:47:53,960
I'm gonna go this way. Wait, wait, what? Can I go down here? Can I get back up?

575
01:47:54,680 --> 01:48:14,979
Should I go in the drain? What the fuck? I, I've got, I'm going to unclog the drain.

576
01:48:23,180 --> 01:48:30,729
This is crazy. Chibi, you just earned a cleaning bonus. Your happy point bonus is

577
01:48:31,850 --> 01:48:37,899
15. This game would make a really good base for a counter-strike map.

578
01:48:37,899 --> 01:48:56,170
Any more trash? Dirt over here. More over here. Let's keep going.

579
01:48:58,250 --> 01:49:07,479
Trash is down here. Look at this. Disgusting over here.

580
01:49:10,149 --> 01:49:32,090
It's all this junk. Okay, gonna fly for us. What's that? There's a rat!

581
01:49:36,279 --> 01:49:50,649
Uh, shoot him. I'm almost out of battery. I gotta go back up. All right, I'm almost out of battery.

582
01:49:50,649 --> 01:50:05,979
Look at how much money's down here. I gotta go. I gotta go. The audio is fucked up. I think this

583
01:50:05,979 --> 01:50:20,460
is the game. It's not happening anywhere else. I think that doesn't happen up here.

584
01:50:21,579 --> 01:50:37,909
Yeah, that's only happening in certain places. Uh, okay. Um, I need, where's that, where's that

585
01:50:37,909 --> 01:51:01,510
battery? Like right here? Right there. I'm dead. I'm right here. Lower the game audio in the settings.

586
01:51:02,390 --> 01:51:19,079
I don't, I don't think this, I can't even do that. Lower the game difficulty.

587
01:51:20,920 --> 01:51:25,350
Should I go back down? All right, I'm gonna charge. I'm gonna charge and then go back down

588
01:51:25,350 --> 01:51:41,130
into the rat cave. You're gonna hear some crackling, but it's all right. In the emulator settings.

589
01:51:41,130 --> 01:51:55,500
This is not on an emulator. All right, let me go back down. I want to fight the rat.

590
01:52:06,539 --> 01:52:14,539
Technically, the Wii plays GameCube games by emulating them. Okay, fine. Okay. Sure.

591
01:52:15,340 --> 01:52:23,720
It's, it's emulated. All right. That's not even, that's not even true because the Wii is just a

592
01:52:23,720 --> 01:52:32,489
GameCube. We already went up with these yesterday. The Wii is a GameCube. All right. Don't clean.

593
01:52:32,489 --> 01:52:48,569
Don't clean. Nope. I'm compulsively cleaning. I want to kill that run. All right. So the plan is

594
01:52:49,210 --> 01:53:08,500
get those coins. If I see a rat, shoot it with blaster. Any rats down here? No rat, right?

595
01:53:09,060 --> 01:53:16,619
I want those coins. Can I knock this down? All right. There's a rat in there. All right. This is

596
01:53:16,619 --> 01:53:47,779
blocked. All right. Blaster. Let's shoot him. Um, wait. What's this? Um, can I jump? It's to hide.

597
01:53:48,420 --> 01:53:51,560
Is there any way I can climb up or anything? I can't climb up like this.

598
01:53:52,520 --> 01:54:10,779
Shit. How do I get up there? I can get up there. Try to push the thing over with the blaster.

599
01:54:12,060 --> 01:54:19,960
It probably is like a, I'm going to assume there's a spring. Yeah. No. It's probably a spring.

600
01:54:20,920 --> 01:54:27,850
Let's get out of here. We'll come back here later. There's a lot of money over there too.

601
01:54:28,810 --> 01:54:48,020
Yeah. We'll come back here later. Dragged you down by the cord. Oh fuck. I'm getting low.

602
01:54:48,659 --> 01:55:00,500
I'm getting low. I'm getting low. I'm getting low. Oh no. Oh no. Is it?

603
01:55:00,500 --> 01:55:15,689
Is it three? We're good. All right. That's cool to know.

604
01:55:17,670 --> 01:55:26,739
Remember the drain because I got to remember the drain. I'm going back down there. When I get this

605
01:55:26,739 --> 01:55:33,430
guys, you said this is like Zelda. No, this is like a Metroidvania. I'd say that's more

606
01:55:33,430 --> 01:55:37,189
like a, well actually Zelda is like a Metroidvania kind of. Yeah. You're right. Fuck.

607
01:55:39,689 --> 01:55:44,409
You get an item to come back and do something else later. Yeah.

608
01:55:45,050 --> 01:55:51,319
And it is like a Metroidvania. Oh wait. This is the dog house.

609
01:55:57,430 --> 01:56:05,590
Shit. These are the dog tags, right?

610
01:56:09,939 --> 01:56:20,710
TV robo. The free rangers were wearing the same kind of things around their necks.

611
01:56:20,710 --> 01:56:27,960
Safe passage now, right? All right. Somebody said to do that. It doesn't work.

612
01:56:32,140 --> 01:56:46,020
Five happy points. All right. Nice. So now I can go back to the, we'll go back to the foyer.

613
01:56:46,579 --> 01:57:04,569
I might not have enough daytime for this. Again, fully recharged. Are you going to save the game?

614
01:57:04,569 --> 01:57:15,500
No. What am I playing this on? I'm playing this on a Wii. I have, that's going to keep happening.

615
01:57:15,500 --> 01:57:23,640
I think I have a Wii which is plugged in HD and I'm using the original GameCube game chibi robo

616
01:57:25,369 --> 01:57:29,529
and that is capturing through a capture card, which is being shown to you on the screen right

617
01:57:29,529 --> 01:57:42,039
now. Show the disc. I did yesterday. What's with this? Like I need to prove I did this yesterday.

618
01:57:43,930 --> 01:58:03,270
I did this exact thing yesterday. I'm here. Where are those demon doors? I have enough time to just

619
01:58:03,270 --> 01:58:12,470
fuck around out here. Let's go outside. I have plenty of battery. Let's go. Remember, you can't

620
01:58:12,470 --> 01:58:24,119
afford chibi robo. It's just like, what does that even mean? Yeah. What are you talking about?

621
01:58:24,119 --> 01:58:34,340
You can't even, you can't afford chibi robo. Oh, I got to throw my trash away. It's a dead frog.

622
01:58:34,340 --> 01:58:46,779
Oh no. Oh no. Ribbit, ribbit, wheeze. I need frog medicine. She's all dehydrated and shriveled.

623
01:58:48,020 --> 01:58:52,500
Hasn't rained lately and it looks like she's really weak. This is so distressing. We have to

624
01:58:52,500 --> 01:59:35,380
get her some water. Mug into the sink with water. Is there a hose out here? Stop cleaning. She's

625
01:59:35,380 --> 01:59:46,380
dead. I need, I don't know where to get water. Oh, I saved an ant. Wait, there's water right here.

626
01:59:46,380 --> 02:00:16,630
How do I open this? That's like a water symbol, right? Crown pound? The tap in the kitchen?

627
02:00:17,590 --> 02:00:32,039
Or is there a hose? Oh no, I think it's just a weird symbol. Oh, is there a hose out here?

628
02:00:34,789 --> 02:00:39,430
I got a decent amount of money.

629
02:00:42,739 --> 02:00:50,729
Is there a hose out here? You'd think there might be. I mean, can I get up this? Climb a tree?

630
02:00:55,800 --> 02:01:14,779
Hose. Water. Some kind of water hose. Over here? What can I do with, lay on this?

631
02:01:16,869 --> 02:01:38,890
What is that? Uh, it doesn't do anything. Well, we'll see you tomorrow, frog. Dead. The frog's

632
02:01:38,890 --> 02:01:58,659
gonna be fine. Morning. Suggest your happy point. Your chibi ranking has gone from. That's a lot,

633
02:01:58,659 --> 02:02:18,810
actually. 93 more happy points. Hooray. If you see a sunshine sticker, I suggest you pop it with your

634
02:02:18,810 --> 02:02:26,329
chibi blaster. Try using your chibi vision as a scope. I know that already. Would you like to

635
02:02:26,329 --> 02:02:35,210
save? Yes, I would. I also want to try this. I want to try this. Give me one second while I do this.

636
02:02:36,090 --> 02:02:45,220
Let me see if I can. I think it's just the way that it's being fed through. Ladies and

637
02:02:45,220 --> 02:02:51,500
gentlemen, I just fixed it. It's been fixed. I just fixed it. You should not hear any more

638
02:02:51,500 --> 02:03:08,180
cracking or popping ever again. It's been fixed. Thank you for the applause. I hope I did fix it.

639
02:03:08,180 --> 02:03:23,189
Let's see if I can prove it. He said that last time, too. No, no, this actually should work.

640
02:03:23,909 --> 02:03:33,260
Let's see. Because through my capture device, I could see it peaking when I just pulled it up.

641
02:03:33,260 --> 02:03:36,939
So it should no longer be peaking on my capture device, which means I'm going to

642
02:03:36,939 --> 02:03:44,220
artificially inflate the sound like this. So I've artificially inflated the sound.

643
02:03:46,949 --> 02:03:59,829
I've dropped the actual input. We'll find out. You tell me if you still hear it. All right.

644
02:04:00,710 --> 02:04:15,050
Let's put the dog tags on. Do I just own them? I think I just own them. Crackling

645
02:04:15,050 --> 02:04:25,140
sound made it more authentic. Let's go to the fort. I now have a dog tag.

646
02:04:26,739 --> 02:04:30,170
I would clean this up, but I mean, I can't leave a mess.

647
02:04:31,130 --> 02:04:35,130
I told you this and you wonder why I can't play Luigi's Mansion 3.

648
02:04:36,010 --> 02:05:04,170
Because it sucks? No, because I suck up everything. I suck up everything. It's bad.

649
02:05:04,170 --> 02:05:21,159
I have dog tags. Unauthorized intruder. Don't let him pass. Take him out. What? Keep your rubble.

650
02:05:21,159 --> 02:05:28,020
This isn't good. Yes. It's gonna be really hard to get over there. These rangers mean business.

651
02:05:28,020 --> 02:05:31,270
The only way to get through this is to find something you can use to cover yourself. Well, I can.

652
02:05:36,630 --> 02:05:55,399
Haha. Haha. All right. Where am I going? Where does it want me to go? In the basement? Does this

653
02:05:55,399 --> 02:06:11,939
thing have infinite health? Is it gonna break? How do I get to the basement? Over here? Son of a

654
02:06:12,899 --> 02:06:22,140
battle tank. Well, I guess he didn't look like an enemy. Come to think of it, he may be an ally.

655
02:06:23,100 --> 02:06:25,909
But still, my men were just pitiful.

656
02:06:27,909 --> 02:06:35,880
TV robo. I can't believe my electronic eyes. That was truly amazing. You ran through those

657
02:06:35,880 --> 02:06:42,279
fearsome free ranges without getting shot. They really are superb. Of course, I was able to fly

658
02:06:42,279 --> 02:06:52,020
right over them. Uh oh. Larry David just said something potentially controversial.

659
02:06:52,100 --> 02:06:54,250
That strange sound seems to have come from here.

660
02:06:57,800 --> 02:07:00,680
Between you and me, I'm a little scared, but I think we'd better go investigate.

661
02:07:05,659 --> 02:07:31,560
Okay. Outlets in the basement? Staircase. Oh man. Easy. Easy. All right. Push it off to get the

662
02:07:31,560 --> 02:07:46,649
the goods inside. Oops. Can I get back up? Five happy points. Nice. Okay. Wait, what? Is there

663
02:07:46,649 --> 02:07:56,300
something up here? I gotta go to a wastebasket. I probably have a lot of stuff here. I haven't

664
02:07:56,300 --> 02:08:10,119
done it in a while. All right. Cool. Wow. Look at all this trash. It's so much of it.

665
02:08:11,399 --> 02:08:27,930
Empty bottle. Broken bottle. All right. There's gotta be an outlet down here. Everybody has

666
02:08:27,930 --> 02:08:32,649
outlets in the basement. How the fuck does your laundry machine knock? You know what I'm saying?

667
02:08:32,649 --> 02:08:43,270
Where is it? Yeah. There's an outlet right across the way. All right. We're good. Where is it? Just

668
02:08:43,270 --> 02:08:53,449
so I can make sure I know where it is. All right. Clean this up. The tough mess. Do I appear at the

669
02:08:53,449 --> 02:09:17,449
toothbrush at any time? All right. Mess contained. Any more? Yeah. Oil over here. Nice. All right.

670
02:09:17,449 --> 02:09:25,350
Wait. I know. I know. I'll be fine. There's a little bit more oil over here. Cleaning bonus.

671
02:09:27,210 --> 02:09:44,729
Whoa. That was loud and crackling. Well, I think it's just the way that the Wii plays the GameCube

672
02:09:44,729 --> 02:10:06,199
game. I mean, this is not like there's anything weird going on here. Good emulator. I need to

673
02:10:06,199 --> 02:10:21,239
update the emulator. There's no updating emulator. I mean, I thought it was fixed. I looked over at

674
02:10:21,239 --> 02:10:30,300
my gacha software and it was blowing out into the red. I guess not. I can power this person.

675
02:10:30,300 --> 02:10:37,800
Hold on. I gotta clean this shit up. I think it might be the memory card.

676
02:10:40,680 --> 02:11:01,420
Can I power him on? It's probably like a boss fight. I'm not doing this yet.

677
02:11:01,420 --> 02:11:11,210
How were the tacos last night? They were fucking incredible. All right. Well, let's blast this.

678
02:11:11,210 --> 02:11:23,079
I had a range.

679
02:11:31,109 --> 02:11:31,430
Really?

680
02:11:44,500 --> 02:12:12,979
Fully charged. This is a half-life puzzle. All right. Let's turn this guy on and hopefully not

681
02:12:12,979 --> 02:12:18,460
blow out everybody's speakers with the loud crackling noises that the original GameCube

682
02:12:18,539 --> 02:12:46,359
disc in the original Wii does. That's part of the game. Chibi-Robo. Are you all right?

683
02:12:48,659 --> 02:12:55,369
I think so. Stop fooling around. Come on. This place gives me the creeps.

684
02:12:56,010 --> 02:13:04,039
Hurry and get out of here. Oh, your eyes.

685
02:13:08,819 --> 02:13:19,619
He fried his circuit. No. Chibi-Robo.

686
02:13:19,619 --> 02:13:36,420
Don't die. No. What is going on? Am I going through like robot? Is this me and my family?

687
02:13:37,220 --> 02:14:11,510
Wait, I've downloaded all his memories. This guy's huge. Emulator virus. But then they powered him

688
02:14:11,510 --> 02:14:23,670
down because he ran out of battery. What's he doing? Is he... was he catching? When he threw a frisbee at

689
02:14:23,670 --> 02:14:47,529
him too hard? Wait, he got beamed up? $100,000 to fix? Too much money to fix. Too expensive. That's

690
02:14:47,529 --> 02:15:02,840
so sad. We can make that money. That's the whole game. Too much electric bill. Chibi-Robo. You died.

691
02:15:08,229 --> 02:15:32,569
Huh? Ah, phone call for Telly. Gotta go. Wait, he's gonna dip out like that, Telly? They just

692
02:15:32,569 --> 02:15:43,180
gave birth. I can't believe he can move after all this time. I wonder what this might be.

693
02:15:43,899 --> 02:16:03,720
More importantly, Chibi-Robo. We would just get... Can you cry into the mug

694
02:16:05,050 --> 02:16:12,140
and dump it in the frog's mouth? We were just getting used to this house and now you die and

695
02:16:13,100 --> 02:16:29,399
leave me all alone. Alone. Alone. No, alone. This took a really sad turn. I was just cleaning

696
02:16:29,399 --> 02:16:47,659
stuff with a toothbrush. I'm fine, see? Oh, you're alive. I'm so glad, Chibi-Robo. I thought you'd

697
02:16:47,659 --> 02:16:56,459
kick the bucket. I suppose I shouldn't have worried. I was gonna fix you no matter what, even if I had

698
02:16:56,459 --> 02:17:06,889
to use my own parts. What a true friend. So tell me, did you dream? Yes. You didn't dream, right? I

699
02:17:06,889 --> 02:17:12,709
just said I did. It's quite possible that you downloaded data from Giga-Robo's memory banks.

700
02:17:15,030 --> 02:17:24,219
All this excitement is really talking me out. See you later, Chibi-Robo. This is Giga-Robo and

701
02:17:24,219 --> 02:17:51,659
Chibi-Robo. Giga. Let's pick up this thing. Giga battery. Giga-Robo, wow, that's a...

702
02:17:52,620 --> 02:18:07,829
What is it? If you plan to take that battery, I'd thank you to charge it up and bring it back in

703
02:18:07,829 --> 02:18:27,879
one piece. And yet, that's not what you want, is it? You colossal matey. It's Gino. It's fat Gino.

704
02:18:28,440 --> 02:18:35,100
This is where he's been the whole time. This is where he's been. They've kept him in a basement.

705
02:18:36,600 --> 02:18:49,340
Grotto's hair. If only you could speak to me, Giga-Robo. Is that really a Giga-Robo? Is he

706
02:18:49,739 --> 02:19:02,520
d-d-d-dead? Robots don't die, you flying boy. Oh, right. He sure is big. He's a lot taller than

707
02:19:02,520 --> 02:19:10,469
you, Chibi-Robo. One moment. According to my data, he's a very old model. He started a trend known

708
02:19:10,469 --> 02:19:17,559
as Giga-Robo fever a long time ago, but his energy consumption was too high and is popularly plummeted.

709
02:19:19,979 --> 02:19:29,260
Shut your blowhole. You think you're smart, but you know nothing about him. I'm so sorry.

710
02:19:30,700 --> 02:19:34,139
Anyway, thank you very much. If you'll excuse me.

711
02:19:35,579 --> 02:19:41,270
Furl your sails, matey. You can't go anywhere yet.

712
02:19:41,270 --> 02:19:47,510
Jerma has an opportunity to do an Irish pirate guy. He's gonna build this all stream.

713
02:19:49,159 --> 02:19:57,319
You come blowin' in here like a summer, squall, and leave without introducing yourselves.

714
02:19:57,319 --> 02:20:08,709
I'm sorry. Uh, my name is Telly, and that over there is Chibi-Robo. Don't mind him. He doesn't

715
02:20:08,709 --> 02:20:25,530
talk much. And who might you be? It's about time you asked. My name's Captain Catview.

716
02:20:25,530 --> 02:20:34,860
I'm the scourge of the seven seas, the overlord of the oceans blue, the king of all pirates,

717
02:20:34,860 --> 02:20:48,059
Captain Plankbeard. You're a pirate? Hey, or at least I used to be. Now I'm

718
02:20:48,059 --> 02:20:55,690
nothing more than a shipless landlubber. Oh, how did you lose your ship? That tail's as long as

719
02:20:55,690 --> 02:21:04,969
the sea be deep, and as sad as a tailless mermaid. But me throat's as parched as me soul,

720
02:21:04,969 --> 02:21:16,280
so I'll be safe in this story. But I mean, yeah, I love the taste of water. Oh, give me that.

721
02:21:16,280 --> 02:21:22,040
What say ye? Will ye return some day and listen to me sad tale of woe? What a boring shitty pirate

722
02:21:22,040 --> 02:21:28,819
character. I love the taste of water. Oh, I'm just so... Look at me. I've got me ship in...

723
02:21:28,819 --> 02:21:36,840
Oh, I love water. Hydrate, kids. There's supposed to be rum in there or something.

724
02:21:36,920 --> 02:21:43,829
There's supposed to be something in there with like three Xs on it. I promise.

725
02:21:47,670 --> 02:21:51,260
Never make a promise you can't keep. That's the pirate's code.

726
02:21:54,459 --> 02:22:03,319
Bugleberry voice. You do well to remember me words, you evergrown piece of plankton.

727
02:22:03,319 --> 02:22:10,489
I won't forget them. Even if I die, I'll come back and remember them.

728
02:22:10,489 --> 02:22:17,239
What did I tell ye? Robots don't die, and ye don't get a scurvy neither.

729
02:22:17,239 --> 02:22:23,209
You're right. That gigabatter is no good by its lonesome.

730
02:22:23,209 --> 02:22:26,409
You need to search the house and find the giga charger.

731
02:22:33,459 --> 02:22:40,340
That was scary. Anyways, let's go back. Need to plug it in to a Tesla battery charger.

732
02:22:40,340 --> 02:22:47,930
All right. Give me that water, though. He loves water. Give me that water. I want your water.

733
02:22:47,930 --> 02:22:57,799
Nice. The gigabatter alone will do you no good. Take the giga charger with ye as well.

734
02:22:57,799 --> 02:23:09,190
I, when the battery's full, juice bring it back here. Ah, yes. Okay. I can't get the water.

735
02:23:09,190 --> 02:23:15,270
He loves water. I need water. All right. Can I do this now? Am I allowed to do this, yo?

736
02:23:16,229 --> 02:23:26,309
Will we get coaxed? Are we still live? What are you talking about? I'm live.

737
02:23:27,190 --> 02:23:34,200
I haven't dropped any frames. What are you talking about? Mini coax? I haven't dropped any frames.

738
02:23:34,200 --> 02:23:36,920
I have zero dropped frames. Maybe it's a twitch problem. I don't know.

739
02:23:38,520 --> 02:23:44,709
Looks like it's about to snap. I've tried this before. Come on. Let me get it.

740
02:23:51,579 --> 02:23:52,079
Yeah.

741
02:23:52,079 --> 02:24:06,600
Find you where you aimed that thing, laddie. I'd not see anyone hurt by ye careless ways.

742
02:24:06,600 --> 02:24:15,690
Nice. I love it. Okay. Is this a photo? Shoot him. Why would I shoot him?

743
02:24:15,690 --> 02:24:48,860
Boil. Pull. Trash. Get it. Oh, I gotta pull it out? Can I pull it out? Uh, well, we, uh,

744
02:24:48,860 --> 02:24:59,120
I just got 20 community subs just came in right now from Jerma's average dong. Jerma's average

745
02:24:59,120 --> 02:25:09,100
dong. Thanks for the 20 community subs. Gunpowder. Appreciate the 20 fucking subs, dude. Thank you.

746
02:25:12,780 --> 02:25:20,909
Average. I'm not even going to respond to that. That's a lot of subs though. Thanks for the subs.

747
02:25:20,909 --> 02:25:31,120
Jerma's, uh, by the way, it's, it's not average. It's Jerma's average dong. The average is misspelled.

748
02:25:31,120 --> 02:25:41,850
Now let's float over there. So wait, do I have enough power for this, right?

749
02:25:41,850 --> 02:25:54,940
Let's put this coins and shit. Ooh, wait. Okay. Um, all right. We got a, I need a better camera.

750
02:25:54,940 --> 02:26:13,520
I'm going to float into the cage. What the fuck was that? All right. What are you doing, Chibi?

751
02:26:13,520 --> 02:26:22,940
It's a dangerous game you be playing. Yarr. What be this? Aye, I see. You're searching for

752
02:26:22,940 --> 02:26:29,879
Giga robots, Giga charger. Chibi, you be lad. You're a slippery fish to get a handle on.

753
02:26:29,879 --> 02:26:38,959
Ha ha ha. Oh, there's a door up there. All right. I'm running out of, uh, all right, put this away.

754
02:26:40,159 --> 02:27:00,590
So now I can climb that. Give me this. I think I found it. All right. Hold on. Can I, give me first

755
02:27:00,590 --> 02:27:09,020
person? There's a frog ring there. I don't think I can make that though. Giga charger. All right.

756
02:27:09,020 --> 02:27:17,469
But can I float from here to there? I don't think I can fly from here to there. That seems

757
02:27:17,469 --> 02:27:34,649
like a long way. Just climb it. Can I climb it? Climb from the other side. Hold on. Let me just

758
02:27:34,649 --> 02:27:42,780
get down here. Another 10 community subs from Jerma's average dong. I need battery before I do

759
02:27:42,780 --> 02:28:02,670
any of this shit. No, no, no, no. Oh God. Oh God. Uh, thanks for the 10 community subs. 30 actually

760
02:28:02,670 --> 02:28:10,600
from Jerma's average dong. Appreciate that. Five more community subs from Jerma's sucks.

761
02:28:11,579 --> 02:28:16,219
You know, let's, you know, let's give some community subs. Uh, Jerma's dick. Jerma's sucks.

762
02:28:16,219 --> 02:28:21,739
Jerma's, uh, Jerma's big dick. Jerma's average dick. Jerma's sucks. Jerma's sucks too. Jerma

763
02:28:21,739 --> 02:28:29,290
lied about how big his dick was. How many of these do we have? How many? Like there's,

764
02:28:29,290 --> 02:28:35,469
there's a hundred of these. It's so funny. All right. Climb up from here.

765
02:28:39,129 --> 02:28:57,040
Not enough. Can I climb this? There's gotta be a way up there. Let me see. How do I get up there?

766
02:28:57,040 --> 02:29:16,799
I can go from here. How do I get up there? Can I, all right. Can I float from one of these steps

767
02:29:16,799 --> 02:29:24,280
over to there? The sling, this, the, the swing you were on. Can I get it from there? From where you

768
02:29:24,280 --> 02:29:45,469
were? If I think it might be too far. Yeah. There's a bunch of bird shit in here. Hold on.

769
02:29:47,290 --> 02:30:06,780
So from here, you, you saying you think I can make it from here?

770
02:30:07,979 --> 02:30:13,709
I doubt it. Oh, I doubt it. I don't think I can go from here to there.

771
02:30:16,729 --> 02:30:25,559
I climb, I'm going to climb up. Oh, I, I can climb up this fucking thing. Oh man. Nice. All right.

772
02:30:25,559 --> 02:30:33,000
Hold on. I got, um, we'll come, we're going to come back. I need to move this. Oh, this is a way. It's

773
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:38,760
wasting battery. Jerma the rope. Jerma the rope. I know, I know, I know. Don't worry. I went up.

774
02:30:38,760 --> 02:30:44,159
All right. I'm going to, oh, there's a demon door. What? I can't push this anymore. Why not?

775
02:30:44,159 --> 02:30:56,079
Jerma the rope. Jerma the rope. I want to push this the other. Why can't I push this anymore?

776
02:30:56,079 --> 02:31:05,930
All right. That's not important right now. The demon door is important. Now don't, I'm going to,

777
02:31:05,930 --> 02:31:22,430
that's waste. Watch out for the bird shit. And I'm going to float down. Money, big money. All right.

778
02:31:22,430 --> 02:31:28,510
Now we float. We float from here. Here. Okay. There's another demon door right there. Is there a plug?

779
02:31:28,510 --> 02:31:33,959
All right. I'm going to, there's a plug right underneath me. Look, lit, literally. And I use

780
02:31:33,959 --> 02:31:47,280
that word actually, literally. There's a plug right underneath me. Okay. This way. Get the frog

781
02:31:47,280 --> 02:32:25,530
coin. Float down again. Monkey. I mean, I thought, I didn't think it was going to take that much

782
02:32:25,530 --> 02:32:34,510
power to float down. I thought it went to zero. All right. I'm not done in here. I want to,

783
02:32:34,510 --> 02:33:00,090
I want to get up the rope. I'm going to open that demon door. Same deal. I'm up.

784
02:33:00,090 --> 02:33:13,959
A couple of nails. Frash? Or is this a block? I can probably float around it, but not yet. I want

785
02:33:13,959 --> 02:33:45,129
to get this demon door. Okay. Put it away. Open. I've got two grin. That's a lot of money. I'm

786
02:33:45,129 --> 02:33:55,159
almost out of time, but can I go up here? Is there anything else up here? I guess I can just go back.

787
02:33:55,159 --> 02:34:03,959
And I can, wait, is there enough time to go get the, uh, I don't think there is. It's okay.

788
02:34:03,959 --> 02:34:12,719
We're about to, it's about to turn off anyway. Save the frog. I got to come back here tomorrow.

789
02:34:13,280 --> 02:34:18,000
This is the plan. Come back here tomorrow to get the, get the giga charger. You could have made it

790
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:26,409
monk ass. I don't think I'm going to save the frog. The frog will be fine. Am I going to save?

791
02:34:26,409 --> 02:34:40,680
Of course I am. Do I have enough time to get it now? Maybe. Let's go chibi robo. The frog will die.

792
02:34:40,680 --> 02:35:14,139
The frog is not going to die. This is a children's game. Game deal. Do I have enough time? Okay.

793
02:35:14,139 --> 02:35:21,819
Float around here. That didn't work. That didn't work. That didn't work. That didn't work. That

794
02:35:21,819 --> 02:35:24,860
didn't work. I thought I could float around it. I will come back tomorrow. Whatever. See you tomorrow.

795
02:35:37,530 --> 02:35:52,159
Let's start the stream. Sorry. The other one. No. Time sure flies when you're making folks happy.

796
02:35:52,959 --> 02:36:02,780
Back to the chibi house. Great work out there. Download.

797
02:36:05,819 --> 02:36:16,780
I'm in top 1000. We're making it to the top 1000. Citrus office into your special. Get a brand new

798
02:36:16,780 --> 02:36:37,200
bonus battery. Ooh, that's a lot. Now let's spend some money. We should do a happiness calculation

799
02:36:37,200 --> 02:36:50,090
every stream. Top 1000 chibi robo stream. Giga robo who is making that noise.

800
02:36:51,850 --> 02:36:56,809
You might not know it, but Giga robo is the brainchild of legendary engineer Dr. Joy

801
02:36:57,450 --> 02:37:05,709
Ebisu of Citrusoft. He made you too. Even though he designed both you, Giga robo is 10 times

802
02:37:05,709 --> 02:37:12,959
bigger than you are. He's a hundred times heavier. Don't get me started about his battery. Who made

803
02:37:12,959 --> 02:37:19,440
you? He uses a thousand times more energy than you do. There was an energy crisis a few years back

804
02:37:20,319 --> 02:37:26,250
and all at once everyone just stopped using their Giga robos all together. These days you can't even

805
02:37:26,250 --> 02:37:31,559
pay someone to take the poor guy off your hands. Sad to see something like this happen off the side

806
02:37:31,559 --> 02:37:40,889
like so much trash. Poor guy. Enough moping around. We've got work to do. Let's go earn us some happy

807
02:37:40,889 --> 02:37:47,239
points. Every time you talk, my ears pop. How do we get you to stop talking? Just take out the

808
02:37:47,239 --> 02:37:57,559
Giga battery you're carrying with you. That's it. Look at that. It's already bigger than you are,

809
02:37:57,559 --> 02:38:22,079
chibi robo. Pretty heavy. Let's set it over there. Emulator noises. If you want to recharge that

810
02:38:22,079 --> 02:38:26,079
Giga battery, you'll need to find a Giga charger. There's got to be one around here somewhere. I know

811
02:38:26,079 --> 02:38:49,530
where it is. You and I both looked at it at the same time. All right, let's get this out. Okay.

812
02:38:49,530 --> 02:39:00,250
Online shop. Charge chip. Chibi battery. Range chip. Hot rod. Space scrambler. There's a charge

813
02:39:00,250 --> 02:39:07,639
chip. Enables the chibi blaster to fire a charged shot. Pretty good. Chibi battery. Chibi robo spare

814
02:39:07,639 --> 02:39:21,079
battery. Yup. Range chip. Enables the chibi blaster to fire long distances. Nectar flower seed. A

815
02:39:21,079 --> 02:39:34,059
cute nectar flower will grow from this seed. Charge shot. All right, I'll get it. I still don't have

816
02:39:34,059 --> 02:39:56,010
enough money for any of this. Thank you for your visit. Charge chip. Chibi battery. Whoa. Chibi

817
02:39:56,010 --> 02:40:15,530
drugs. You've upgraded. Let's go. Let's save it. Back to the downstairs. I want to get that charger.

818
02:40:15,530 --> 02:40:37,680
Put the trash away. Yup. Clean up the confetti. Can I? I don't think I can. Oh, I can. Why are

819
02:40:37,680 --> 02:40:46,940
you throwing trash everywhere? Is this trash? Wow. This is where your utility bots come from.

820
02:40:46,940 --> 02:40:51,579
They're your backup buddies, your support bots. If you have scrap, we can make some utility bots

821
02:40:51,579 --> 02:40:56,959
with the chibi PC. Think there's any scrap in this place? Okay, so that's where I put the scrap. All

822
02:40:56,959 --> 02:41:09,770
right, let's go. Save frog, you monster. I'm on it. Soon. I need a waste basket. Okay, what do you

823
02:41:09,770 --> 02:41:26,750
guys say? You guys say trash barrel, waste basket, trash can. What do you guys say? I say trash can.

824
02:41:27,879 --> 02:41:45,399
Trash can. Or just the trash. Throw it in the trash. Speaking of which. Here we go. Two bottles.

825
02:41:46,639 --> 02:42:05,629
Ooh, look at all that. More broken glass. That's a lot. You got a total of 86 happy points. Holy

826
02:42:05,629 --> 02:42:15,819
shit. Chibi Robo doesn't recycle. Is that demon door? No, let's get that demon door open.

827
02:42:16,459 --> 02:42:47,020
I bet Chibi throws his car batteries in the ocean.

828
02:42:58,430 --> 02:43:32,299
Let's get a, let's plug in. It's illegal and free. Throw batteries in the ocean. You are

829
02:43:32,299 --> 02:43:42,270
fucking crazy. What's wrong with you? No, I didn't even say the damn thing. Save it. Hey.

830
02:43:49,079 --> 02:44:11,639
Baste. Shut up. Oh, baste. Throw your batteries in the ocean. Two hours and 40 minutes. What? Time

831
02:44:11,639 --> 02:44:24,219
flies when you're cleaning up dirt. F***ing pollutants. Ooh, I still like, I still like,

832
02:44:24,219 --> 02:44:29,690
I like can like get up there. I think, I think it was like a, it should be like a ladder. I can

833
02:44:29,690 --> 02:44:41,760
like probably like get on or something. I don't know. Or like go from here. All right, back to

834
02:44:41,760 --> 02:44:59,610
the basement. How is that a tuber? Me saying like a bunch of times is a tuber? People do that? E3

835
02:44:59,610 --> 02:45:27,370
presenter? Uh oh. Crying ribbit girl on stairs. Demon door. Tears on the battlefield? Hi, it's me.

836
02:45:30,510 --> 02:45:35,709
I thought, I thought this was mom. I thought this was mom's foot like going up to, I thought it was

837
02:45:35,709 --> 02:45:58,510
mom standing here. Mom's like an elephant, apparently. Always charge. Always. I'm not going

838
02:45:58,510 --> 02:46:16,799
to save. There are two demon doors. One here and then one under there. Elephant mom. I mean,

839
02:46:17,360 --> 02:46:33,790
whatever. Manka A. What's Manka A? Oh, I didn't get one. Turn it back on. Let me back in. I missed

840
02:46:33,790 --> 02:46:56,780
one. It's the first Manka. What are you talking about? We've made it all the way to Manka S.

841
02:46:57,420 --> 02:47:09,239
He's got that, anything to say? Private Frisco on duty, sir. We can't train when the family is around.

842
02:47:09,879 --> 02:47:30,079
I'm anything in, in direct reach. Not really. Uh, plug in. What is Manka S? Frog face going

843
02:47:30,079 --> 02:47:44,079
fuck. The soldiers remind me of you because you look like an egg. Not even, not even close.

844
02:47:46,799 --> 02:47:55,530
Not even, not even close. I mean, I'm talking not even 1% close. I couldn't be more incorrect.

845
02:47:55,530 --> 02:48:07,370
Well, we're just talking facts here. All right, there's a photo. Free ranger's photo.

846
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:16,959
Um, I not get up here? Shit, I need like a springboard. There's definitely going to be a

847
02:48:16,959 --> 02:48:39,879
springboard. There has to be. All right, let's go see what's going on. What's the matter? Pick me up.

848
02:48:40,680 --> 02:48:55,120
Ribbit. Hello, bit. Jenny, what are you doing up? Go back to your room and go to sleep. Uh, Ribbo.

849
02:48:58,489 --> 02:49:12,840
Night, Ribbit. Gibby Robo. What are you doing? Uh-huh. I see you're trying to reach the second

850
02:49:12,840 --> 02:49:18,909
floor. But these stairs are a problem, aren't they? There's nothing here that you can use as a ladder.

851
02:49:19,629 --> 02:49:24,219
Well, there are ways, but you'll need some special equipment. I'll look into it for you.

852
02:49:25,020 --> 02:49:31,319
Goodbye. Do not leaving. You're just flying behind me. I know you're always there. It freaks me out.

853
02:49:32,120 --> 02:49:46,540
Okay, back to the basement. Back to the basement. I want that, uh, that charger. He's the cameraman.

854
02:49:46,540 --> 02:50:16,440
Yeah, it's like, uh, it's like Lucky 2. Ooh, wait, coins. How did I not get that? Nice. I want to push

855
02:50:16,440 --> 02:50:31,959
this off. Free happy points. Take it. I have to pee. Um, we can take a bathroom break here. Just a

856
02:50:31,959 --> 02:50:54,280
moment. Okay, now I'm ready to get the supercharger. Pee into your, what, pee into my streamer diaper?

857
02:50:54,280 --> 02:51:14,170
You start advertising. Like, Nvidia starts making diapers for gamers. They're all branded. They're

858
02:51:14,170 --> 02:51:25,020
black and green and shit. Play your foolish chatter. You're a cheatin' lion demon crab.

859
02:51:27,370 --> 02:51:34,030
Cheating, how rude. You fail because your soul has not been properly cleansed. Who do you take

860
02:51:34,110 --> 02:51:41,469
me for a brainless piece of kelp? I know you decide whether your eye opens or closes, ye filthy

861
02:51:41,469 --> 02:51:48,219
bilge rat. That is untrue. A person with a pure soul would be able to see this clearly.

862
02:51:48,219 --> 02:51:57,229
Me soul's as clean as the waters of shanty Pete's blessed harbor. Yar, one more time, ye scurvy scum.

863
02:52:01,100 --> 02:52:09,000
There's no way the king of pirates is losing to some half-baked sea cucumber. Ooh, gambling

864
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:13,559
is the game and there's a casino here and yep, yep, yep, yep, yep. Get on with it, you scallywag.

865
02:52:15,790 --> 02:52:32,649
How frightening. Very well, I shall begin. Everything is nothing. Reach out with your soul,

866
02:52:32,649 --> 02:52:50,010
feel, let it flow to my right eye. Will it open or will it remain closed? What do you feel? Will

867
02:52:50,010 --> 02:53:00,889
it open? Yar, last time it was your portside peeper and the time before that starboard.

868
02:53:02,989 --> 02:53:09,600
Yar, you shall open the eye, says I. Are you certain? Wait, he can just open it whenever he

869
02:53:09,600 --> 02:53:21,440
wants. What certain as the tide do ebb and flow? It'll open, I tell you. You're with me, ain't you?

870
02:53:24,639 --> 02:53:36,190
Yes, of course you are. Are you certain? Yar, me pirate's word is as good as me gold.

871
02:53:37,790 --> 02:54:09,399
Very well. It opened. Yar, it opened, I tell you. Put it to your left eye.

872
02:54:10,040 --> 02:54:19,420
Unfortunate. Don't play dumb, you miserable lifeboat leech. You're nothing but a liar and a thief.

873
02:54:19,420 --> 02:54:29,399
There was a wink on screen already. Great pico, great cheeto is more like it. I'll have you

874
02:54:29,399 --> 02:54:37,309
clapped in irons and kneel, keel-hauled. You're lucky I'm without me ship, you great blinkin'

875
02:54:37,309 --> 02:54:54,329
sea slug. I've had me fill of you. Is there actually a wink? Alright, well, my turn. Another

876
02:54:54,329 --> 02:55:06,840
sucker. I mean, oh, hear me, your soul is unclean. Will you cleanse your soul? Sure. Your desire to

877
02:55:06,840 --> 02:55:16,090
achieve enlightenment is quite admirable. Moolah corrupts the soul. If you use your moolah, then

878
02:55:16,090 --> 02:55:24,299
your soul is gradually purified. Now then, allow me to take your moolah as ablution for your dirty

879
02:55:24,379 --> 02:55:31,370
soul. Alright, ten dollars. Let the cleansing begin. By repeating this process, your moolah

880
02:55:31,370 --> 02:55:36,729
will be purified and returned to you in time. This is the one true way to abandon worldly desires

881
02:55:36,729 --> 02:55:55,739
and become one with a higher plane. You have 1,628. How much would you like to purify? 100 bucks.

882
02:55:55,739 --> 02:56:08,120
Let us begin the process of cleansing your moolah and your soul. Everything is nothing.

883
02:56:08,120 --> 02:56:24,000
Entrapment is release. Abandonment is friendship. It worked. The cosmos embraces you with love.

884
02:56:26,250 --> 02:56:36,409
Let your doubts and fears melt away. Doubt corrupts the soul. Release, release your moolah.

885
02:56:39,739 --> 02:56:48,860
We return to a new beginning. Do not let your lack of experience make you nervous.

886
02:56:49,739 --> 02:57:04,139
If you are nervous, then I too am nervous. Let us begin. Oh wanderer, preach with your soul.

887
02:57:04,700 --> 02:57:16,030
Feel with your soul. Let your soul flow to my right eye. Will it open or will it remain shut?

888
02:57:21,440 --> 02:57:33,930
One whose soul is clean will be able to see the answer with certainty. Well, will my eye open?

889
02:57:34,569 --> 02:57:53,020
Okay, what if I say no and then shoot him in the eye? It'll have to be closed. No, it's not going

890
02:57:53,020 --> 02:58:08,200
to open. You believe it will remain closed. Yes, I'm ready. Please do not be staring at me so much.

891
02:58:08,840 --> 02:58:45,040
You will disrupt the cosmic balance. And now, closed. Closed! It's closed! Closed! You are

892
02:58:45,040 --> 02:58:52,600
correct. Oh wait, those are the classic scam. Classic scam. You win one or two times in a row

893
02:58:52,600 --> 02:58:58,729
and then the scam starts. And then you're like, holy shit, I just won 10, I won 100 bucks. I can

894
02:58:58,729 --> 02:59:06,270
do that again and you do 500. And then the scam starts. And the women alike will rejoice in the

895
02:59:06,270 --> 02:59:13,979
presence of your soul. You have gained 200 dollars. I should have went all in. Your noble intentions

896
02:59:13,979 --> 02:59:19,200
and trusting soul have birthed a miracle. I must spread word of this miracle. I must share this

897
02:59:19,200 --> 02:59:28,170
joy with others. Will you continue to cleanse? Nope. I'm out. See you later. Oh my, this is not

898
02:59:28,170 --> 02:59:35,079
part of the plan. You're gonna stop? How unfortunate. Your mula and soul have been cleansed and now

899
02:59:35,079 --> 02:59:41,180
are returned to you. Please come again. Whenever you are, close your eyes, please think of me.

900
02:59:42,059 --> 03:00:02,510
See ya. Thanks for the 100 bucks. I am gonna save and I'm also gonna pee.

901
03:00:08,459 --> 03:00:16,959
Trying to scam a Vegas man. Good luck. All right, I'll be right back. It's gonna be,

902
03:00:18,000 --> 03:00:19,770
you can listen to this music in the meantime.

903
03:03:47,799 --> 03:04:07,739
We love the music. It is pretty good. It's pretty good. It's got a nice little ring to it.

904
03:04:08,620 --> 03:04:19,370
All right, let's go. All right, I'm, something's wrong with me. I thought that was a doorbell.

905
03:04:19,370 --> 03:04:28,729
I thought that somebody rang the doorbell. That was like a perfect dodo. Okay, whatever. All right,

906
03:04:28,729 --> 03:04:37,690
what was I doing? Oh yeah, getting the, the, I was getting the, the giga charger. Okay, up over.

907
03:04:37,690 --> 03:04:48,120
Let's go chibi. I have a question. Why is nobody making me apologize for saying the word chibi?

908
03:04:48,120 --> 03:05:05,799
You guys are okay with that one? You're okay with that one? That's fine. Okay.

909
03:05:11,000 --> 03:05:23,770
Do I just climb the rope? I know. I can't see. I can't see. He's not kawaii robo.

910
03:05:24,170 --> 03:05:50,430
Now I have to apologize. Now I have to apologize. I'm sorry. Now that crossed the line. Let's go over

911
03:05:50,430 --> 03:06:07,840
here. And then get the giga charger. What? Wait, this box is everywhere. Can I not push these off?

912
03:06:07,840 --> 03:06:25,600
How do I get this off? I can't push you off. I can push these ones off. Shit. All right. Um,

913
03:06:25,600 --> 03:06:30,540
hold on. Not too much to do. Okay. I'm just going to get the charger.

914
03:06:34,489 --> 03:06:54,719
Okay. Okay. Okay. Just push it. I can't get them. What? Don't matter. Charge shot. Oh, okay.

915
03:07:01,950 --> 03:07:25,309
Oh, this can soda. He can. Here it is. Let's see. Give me it.

916
03:07:25,309 --> 03:07:35,799
Giga charger. Yes, that'd be it says I. If you don't play more visceral cleanup detail,

917
03:07:35,799 --> 03:07:44,510
I'm refunding the game. Uh, all right. What does that have to do with me?

918
03:07:45,149 --> 03:07:50,110
Do you truly mean to set giga robo to sale and once more? Yes, I do. Let's turn them back on.

919
03:07:50,989 --> 03:08:07,149
Oh, chibi. You're such. Uh, I got one thing for you to remember. Don't use the outlets in the house

920
03:08:07,149 --> 03:08:14,639
when you fill her up. You'll be drawn so much power. The poor Sandersons will go bankrupt,

921
03:08:15,200 --> 03:08:27,120
causing the family hardship wouldn't sit well with giga robo. Ain't that right?

922
03:08:27,120 --> 03:08:34,479
The giant can opener. This just sounds like a vomit sound effect. Somebody's just puking over

923
03:08:34,479 --> 03:08:47,790
and over again. Your I almost forgot giga robo be missing a leg and no peg leg neither.

924
03:08:48,670 --> 03:08:55,629
If memory serves, Captain Sanderson put it in a clear sort of treasure chest.

925
03:08:56,909 --> 03:09:18,569
Sort of a steel trunk with a handle. Okay. Let's float down. Don't run out of battery.

926
03:09:37,389 --> 03:09:56,430
Your energy is all. Are you going to save? All right, so I gotta go find his leg. Is that it?

927
03:09:56,430 --> 03:10:39,469
I think it did everything I can do down here. I need a leg. My leg. You let an unauthorized

928
03:10:39,469 --> 03:10:45,680
intruder walk straight through. Wait, what? What are you talking about? Didn't they just call me

929
03:10:45,680 --> 03:10:53,639
an ally? You incompetent fools aren't fit for egg salad. You disgraced the free rangers. Don't I have

930
03:10:54,440 --> 03:11:04,940
for after me? I'd say you should all be poached. Private Memphis would have been ashamed of you.

931
03:11:05,899 --> 03:11:18,280
Okay. Private Detroit, wake up. Listen up. I'm gonna beat you eggs into a fearsome fighting omelet

932
03:11:18,840 --> 03:11:26,250
and you'll thank me for it. Yes, sir. All right, soldiers, what are the five free ranger rules?

933
03:11:27,290 --> 03:11:31,690
Free rangers rule number one. When Sarge gives an order, private say sir, yes, sir.

934
03:11:32,649 --> 03:11:40,399
Rule number two. Leave no egg behind. Rule number three. Snooze on patrol, get thrown in the hole.

935
03:11:40,559 --> 03:11:47,420
Rule number four. Show up for roll call or suffer the consequences. Rule number five.

936
03:11:48,139 --> 03:11:55,280
Failure to follow orders is punishable by scrambling. All right, never forget the five rules.

937
03:11:56,079 --> 03:12:21,000
Together we will defeat Tau. Go. Text Frisco, begin roll call. Yes, sir. All right. Um, kitchen.

938
03:12:21,000 --> 03:12:27,799
Should I? Where do I want to go? I can't go up to the second floor. What do I have?

939
03:12:29,239 --> 03:12:37,000
I wonder if I should go over here. Save the frog. Save the frog. Save the frog. Should I just,

940
03:12:37,000 --> 03:12:59,360
I mean, can I talk? Save the frog. I need water. Are you the robot that breached our perimeter?

941
03:12:59,920 --> 03:13:16,120
No. Roger, I've got nothing else to say to you. I think I want to go up. Can I go up?

942
03:13:21,229 --> 03:13:30,250
There's nothing over there. I can't really do anything. Red block. Can I climb something? I

943
03:13:30,250 --> 03:13:43,579
don't think so. Wait, can I climb that? Say yes. Why would I do that? Why would I say yes?

944
03:13:44,299 --> 03:13:48,780
Aren't they looking? They're trying to kill me. Are you the robot that breached the perimeter?

945
03:13:48,780 --> 03:13:56,489
I should. Oh, yes, I am. Then they're gonna start firing at it. He'd be a depth charge and call it

946
03:13:56,489 --> 03:14:08,059
a biscuit. Very impressive. Not bad for a pencil neck robot. Just don't let it go. I'm getting,

947
03:14:08,059 --> 03:14:13,840
I'm getting Tasmanian devil vibes from this guy right now. Don't let it go to your scrap metal

948
03:14:13,840 --> 03:14:24,799
head. You aren't half the robot that giga-robo was. Not even half of the half of the robot or

949
03:14:24,799 --> 03:14:36,299
half of that. Do a Tasmanian devil impression? I don't, you, okay. There is no Tasmanian devil

950
03:14:36,299 --> 03:14:45,610
impression unless you go all fucking in. And I'm, I don't know if I'm prepared to go all in. A non

951
03:14:45,610 --> 03:14:53,530
all in impression of Tasmanian devil is bad. And it's gonna be like, duh, that wasn't, come on man,

952
03:14:53,530 --> 03:15:07,600
that sucked. Oh, that was a little, you gotta go fucking all in. Otherwise it's, I'm not, I don't

953
03:15:07,600 --> 03:15:15,479
think I, I don't know if I'm prepared to go all in right now. It's like, it's fucking a hundred percent

954
03:15:15,479 --> 03:15:31,159
all in. Otherwise it's not gonna, I'm not thinking I can go all in. I tried, I tried. I was close.

955
03:15:31,239 --> 03:15:52,010
I got, I was close. You can't, you have to go. You have to be standing and have your arms in the

956
03:15:52,010 --> 03:16:05,260
air and fucking go nuts. Otherwise it's bad. And I fucked it up because I didn't even end it with the

957
03:16:06,139 --> 03:16:17,469
so it's, I couldn't do it. I'm going fuck, you want to go all in? I'll go all in. I gotta stand up.

958
03:16:22,010 --> 03:16:39,950
Okay, I don't have like any close neighbors.

959
03:16:46,700 --> 03:16:50,379
That's not even, I don't even know what that sound would be. That's like, I'm in,

960
03:16:50,379 --> 03:17:12,010
I just got thrown into like a blender. Like what's going on? Outlast? What do you mean outlast?

961
03:17:17,319 --> 03:17:29,479
Wink? I would never do that on camera. Doing a Tasmanian devil impression on camera. No way.

962
03:17:30,120 --> 03:17:33,079
No way. That would be, the word I'm looking for is embarrassing.

963
03:17:33,959 --> 03:17:41,790
An all in Tasmanian devil is impressive. Otherwise it's embarrassing. And there's a very

964
03:17:41,790 --> 03:17:59,899
fine fucking line. I'm not even sure I hit it. All right, what do I need to do? It was on the mark.

965
03:18:01,899 --> 03:18:20,760
I need water. Wait, I haven't been up there. Green screen request is to do that on, oh my god.

966
03:18:20,760 --> 03:18:30,239
That would be so fucking funny. I already see, I can already see the edits of me spinning around

967
03:18:30,239 --> 03:18:34,479
and doing that and it being in like Looney Tunes cartoons. All right, yeah, put it on,

968
03:18:34,479 --> 03:18:42,590
get it on the recommendation when I finally fucking do that. I'll spin around and shit. Oh,

969
03:18:42,590 --> 03:19:16,969
that'd be so stupid. I can't, can I make it? I need, can I climb up here? I need water. Water.

970
03:19:16,969 --> 03:19:26,809
I can actually, I can do it from here. I should be able to do it from here, right? All the way to

971
03:19:26,809 --> 03:19:53,159
the top. Get on the table. Drink. Okay. Pretty good. All right, so from here I should be able

972
03:19:53,159 --> 03:20:06,010
to do it from here, right? Oh no, I'm almost out of time. Way to go. Call it a day.

973
03:20:06,010 --> 03:20:12,270
Okay.

974
03:20:18,030 --> 03:20:20,459
Remember, that was the poison cup.

975
03:20:23,719 --> 03:20:32,139
Somebody came in here and poisoned it. Oh, 700.

976
03:20:36,700 --> 03:20:49,079
I think I can buy another upgrade too. Now just take out the Giga charger you're carrying with you.

977
03:20:51,579 --> 03:20:55,020
That's it. Look at that. It's already bigger than you are, Achieb. I know, everything's bigger than

978
03:20:55,020 --> 03:21:06,440
me. Let me guess, I have to pay money to fill this?

979
03:21:22,030 --> 03:21:34,110
Okay, let's, let's check it out. What's the, what's the deal? What does it take?

980
03:21:39,370 --> 03:21:41,850
Looks like the Giga battery doesn't have any energy stored up at all.

981
03:21:43,129 --> 03:21:45,530
Gonna take a whole lot of juice to charge that battery.

982
03:21:46,489 --> 03:21:49,770
I can't charge it from the outlets in the house. That would break the family's bank.

983
03:21:51,450 --> 03:21:57,530
Well, I, I'm getting paid from the family. So the more work, if I do extra work and get paid more

984
03:21:57,530 --> 03:22:07,600
money, it is their money. If I want to charge it. Um, sure. Thousand kilowatts equals a thousand

985
03:22:07,600 --> 03:22:24,090
dollars. How many kilowatts will you charge? Thousand. Well, that's not very much. More,

986
03:22:24,090 --> 03:22:47,799
Chibi-Robo, more. I'm gonna get a nectar flower seed. Okay, I have, where do I plant the flowers?

987
03:22:52,059 --> 03:23:03,440
More, Chibi-Robo, more. Sorry about that, my bad. Don't be sorry. Just don't do it anymore.

988
03:23:03,920 --> 03:23:12,840
All right. We need water for the frog outside. Back to the kitchen. I talked to the little girl

989
03:23:12,840 --> 03:23:22,750
again. Let's talk to the girl. Anything else for us to do with the girl? Oh, she's drawing a picture

990
03:23:22,750 --> 03:23:42,350
of me. Ribbit, gimme ribbit. Gimme, gimme what? Oh, gimme. Gimmie the little girl. I got no water.

991
03:23:43,680 --> 03:24:10,200
Oh, gimme. Give the little girl a gunpowder. Frog ring? You want this? Thanks, Ribbit.

992
03:24:13,799 --> 03:24:28,360
Sixty-six happy points. Holy shit. Do it again? Eight more, Ribbit. Okay, here. Let's, oh no,

993
03:24:28,360 --> 03:24:40,139
I'll give you another present. She's demanding them. Thank you. Eight more. All right. Uh,

994
03:24:40,940 --> 03:24:53,440
we need to go to the kitchen. Oh, did I give both? Maybe I gave both.

995
03:25:03,850 --> 03:25:08,010
We haven't even tested if this has synced up or not. It's been like three and a half hours.

996
03:25:08,010 --> 03:25:25,479
We need to do that. Ready? Bum, bum, bum, bum. Are we good? Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

997
03:25:25,479 --> 03:25:42,219
All right, good. Bosh up, bosh up. Crazy into, crazy into you. Now you guys are making me do it.

998
03:25:42,860 --> 03:25:50,840
Chibi-Robo already? One day shipped memory card? Hey, when I tell you I'm gonna make something

999
03:25:50,840 --> 03:26:00,670
happen, I'm gonna make it happen. Bum. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, bum. Say, Chibo, you saw Jenny, right?

1000
03:26:01,309 --> 03:26:06,280
Yes, I did. Don't you think she looks weird? I mean, she thinks she's a frog.

1001
03:26:08,520 --> 03:26:23,159
Uh, she's just a kid having fun. No, she just, she just, she's just a frog. She's a kid. She's

1002
03:26:23,159 --> 03:26:27,479
like two. One day she just started saying Ribbit and nothing else. I don't know what happened.

1003
03:26:28,829 --> 03:26:34,430
I know, I live with freaks. Holy shit, mom. Would you like to chat with me for a bit? Yeah, sure.

1004
03:26:36,670 --> 03:26:41,739
Oh, you're well made. Now that the water is boiling, let's have tea.

1005
03:26:44,969 --> 03:27:03,120
Since you're so small, you can sit over here. Okay. B-movie? That's what I was thinking too.

1006
03:27:03,840 --> 03:27:14,319
Oh, do you see my husband sleeping on the sofa? Lazy, no good, so-and-so.

1007
03:27:19,420 --> 03:27:27,770
Mm, that's right. Sure. But you think I'm too harsh? It was his fault. He bought you without

1008
03:27:27,770 --> 03:27:33,659
even asking me. He's between jobs right now, and yet he spends moolah like crazy. He's a slacker

1009
03:27:33,659 --> 03:27:48,889
and a bum. Uh, I mean, we're having tea. We're like-you're venting. Should I-is this like a

1010
03:27:49,530 --> 03:27:57,639
no? Yeah, yeah. Or is this like a no, no? No, he's just, he's just between jobs. Oh, I'm sorry.

1011
03:27:57,639 --> 03:28:06,040
It's not fair for me to go off on you like that. You know, tea always tastes better when you have

1012
03:28:06,040 --> 03:28:22,909
someone to talk to. Thank you, Chibo. 13 happy points. That's it? I mean, someone who says

1013
03:28:22,909 --> 03:28:31,870
something other than ribbit. Maybe I made it a little too strong. I think this tea is too

1014
03:28:31,870 --> 03:28:42,329
bitter. Oh, very nice. You've been cleaning up the house. Thank you, Chibo. I think mom needs to go

1015
03:28:42,329 --> 03:28:58,540
on vacation. Oh, my little teacup. Can I drink it? Sugar? Oh, you want sugar? You'll stuff anything

1016
03:28:58,540 --> 03:29:08,329
in your head, won't you? You want some sugar? Sugar cube. Oh, you want some? Uh, I'll get that.

1017
03:29:08,329 --> 03:29:16,540
Let me get that for you. Oh, cookies! Yes, those are delicious, but they'll make you fat if you eat

1018
03:29:16,540 --> 03:29:28,000
too many. Mom, can you stop being the ultimate buzzkill? Oh, that? Yes, those are all bills.

1019
03:29:28,879 --> 03:29:34,620
My husband is constantly blowing all our moolah on his stupid toys. People are supposed to grow out

1020
03:29:34,620 --> 03:29:43,819
of toys. Sooner or later, at least normal people are. If you put that in the garbage can, it would

1021
03:29:43,819 --> 03:29:56,600
be a big help. I bet Jenny would really like that. I know she would, because I actually talk to your

1022
03:29:56,600 --> 03:30:07,790
daughter. One of these days, I'm going to sell all his toys at a garage sale or just throw them out.

1023
03:30:08,510 --> 03:30:29,469
Can I do anything else? No? Okay, I got everything on the table. You gotta clean up your cookie

1024
03:30:29,469 --> 03:30:37,450
crumbs, though. I got this. Don't worry, Mrs. Sanderson. I bet the goldfish will eat it. Yep,

1025
03:30:37,450 --> 03:30:47,000
make her tea sweet. Hey, Chibo, did you bring me a sugar cube? Yes, I did. I'm here to serve.

1026
03:30:47,639 --> 03:31:06,559
Gunpowder. No, I'm not going to poison her. I want the happy points. I'm trying to save money to

1027
03:31:06,559 --> 03:31:21,760
bring back Giga Chad or whatever his name is. How thoughtful of you. You got $36. Spread the

1028
03:31:21,760 --> 03:31:27,129
happiness. And his dad still watches space hunter Drake Redcrest. It's like living with an infant.

1029
03:31:28,329 --> 03:31:30,969
I mean, he's an adult. Don't you think there's something wrong with him?

1030
03:31:33,370 --> 03:31:45,040
I'm not a marriage counselor. Okay, let me answer this truthfully. On one hand,

1031
03:31:45,680 --> 03:31:53,549
he's spending all their money on toys. They got bills to pay. It's pretty irresponsible. I mean,

1032
03:31:53,549 --> 03:32:00,219
that's like, what the fuck are you doing? On the other hand, probably six months ago, I watched the

1033
03:32:00,219 --> 03:32:22,590
entire first season of Spongebob. Just in bed. So this is a tough one for me. Now he's projecting.

1034
03:32:24,030 --> 03:32:29,709
Let her vent. All right, vent. Yes. Yes. Come on. What's he doing? He buys all these. You're very

1035
03:32:29,709 --> 03:32:34,989
understanding. Our upstairs bedroom is crammed full of that pathetic Drake Redcrest junk.

1036
03:32:36,190 --> 03:32:41,229
Say, how do you reach high places when you're such a little guy? I bet that chibi robo manual

1037
03:32:41,229 --> 03:32:49,149
that Jenny's dad got would say something about that. Oh, no, it's bitter. I forgot to stir it.

1038
03:32:49,950 --> 03:33:01,979
Let's see something to stir with something to stir with. Wow, that's a kid's spoon, isn't it?

1039
03:33:03,100 --> 03:33:08,299
I bet you could use that as a shovel. Isn't there a spoon around here somewhere?

1040
03:33:11,739 --> 03:33:29,120
I got it. I got this. I got this. Where was it? I got this spoon. Where was it? Spoon. All right,

1041
03:33:29,120 --> 03:33:50,680
I got this. It's up there. How do I get up there? I can't. I remember I couldn't climb that.

1042
03:33:53,870 --> 03:34:00,299
All right, I'm going to just jump. There's I there's no jump in this game. You can't reach it.

1043
03:34:01,020 --> 03:34:04,479
There's no reaching it. You can't reach it yet. There's no you can't reach it. There's no reaching

1044
03:34:04,479 --> 03:34:32,569
it. Well, I guess I should get back to work. Well, okay. Back to the grind. I'm going to feed the

1045
03:34:32,569 --> 03:34:46,799
goldfish again because mom won't do it. Can I help with the dishes? Can I fill the mug? Yes,

1046
03:34:46,799 --> 03:35:04,329
I want to give the fish a crumb, cookie crumb. I'm going to give the fish gunpowder.

1047
03:35:05,530 --> 03:35:14,989
Okay, can I fill the mug with water? You're so kind, Chibo. I should have married you instead

1048
03:35:14,989 --> 03:35:45,760
of that slob. I just nodded my head. All right, give me water. Mug, water, fill it. Mom, you missed

1049
03:35:45,760 --> 03:36:01,049
a dish. Just kidding. It's me. Jenny's dad. Jenny and Taro are such slobs. We have garbage

1050
03:36:01,049 --> 03:36:05,370
and stains everywhere. I love it when you help out. It saves me a lot of trouble.

1051
03:36:06,329 --> 03:36:19,040
I'll make sure to give Telly your moolah bonus. All right. Jenny's dad. Not even addressing him

1052
03:36:19,040 --> 03:36:50,700
by his name. Jenny's dad. No, I won't. Okay, we're good. God, their marriage is over. Jesus.

1053
03:36:56,590 --> 03:37:08,170
All right, I need to get up here. What is this? Yeah, those are deadlines from bill collectors.

1054
03:37:08,170 --> 03:37:16,760
We're pretty far behind. This is bad. This is bad. All right. Yeah, I'm on mom's side.

1055
03:37:17,559 --> 03:37:30,090
I'm on mom's side. Wait, can I plant? Hold on. Don't I have seeds? Can I plant them here?

1056
03:37:31,290 --> 03:37:53,440
Oh, I need to shovel. Yeah, okay. What do we got? I need the spoon. Can't get up there from here.

1057
03:37:54,399 --> 03:38:00,879
What about this way? I can't. How do I get up there? See, I'm saying like there's no reliable

1058
03:38:00,879 --> 03:38:09,959
way. Maybe if I can, I get on the fish tank and climb up on that thing. I can't climb this.

1059
03:38:10,520 --> 03:38:15,959
This would be the way that I would say you would do it. Can't float from here. Can I?

1060
03:38:16,840 --> 03:38:26,680
Cannot climb these bottles. That seems strange. I feel like I should be able to.

1061
03:38:27,479 --> 03:38:57,629
The game cube on the shelf? Is there? Where? There's no game cube. All right, I can't really

1062
03:38:57,629 --> 03:39:14,590
do anything. I need water. I can't fill the mug. Can't get from here. Turn around, you fool.

1063
03:39:15,469 --> 03:39:48,959
Is there anything else I can do with mom? Mom, help. I fell in the drain. Turn the garbage

1064
03:39:48,959 --> 03:40:05,760
disposal on. I don't think that's going to help me. Wait, the water. Tea. Can I get water from the

1065
03:40:06,719 --> 03:40:13,920
cup? The tea thing here? I can get water from this, right? Water. Is water in here? No. Oh, cans.

1066
03:40:14,559 --> 03:40:34,409
That's it. I can climb this. Chibi, you can't climb this. It's perfect. It's exactly what you

1067
03:40:34,409 --> 03:40:52,090
need to do. Oh, crumbs. Get the fish. Climb up on the ladder. That's not a bad idea. Not a bad idea.

1068
03:40:57,719 --> 03:41:02,360
Up there. I know you can get up there. I've gone up there before.

1069
03:41:03,319 --> 03:41:26,170
Chibi. Oh, it's this side. Can I climb this? Oh, I can. This is where the grease is in the fan.

1070
03:41:28,760 --> 03:42:24,079
What are you doing up here? What the hell is he doing up here? Why is this wrong? The families

1071
03:42:25,079 --> 03:42:49,309
here. I can't let them see me. Aha. You have tone up me. I simply got have misunderstanding.

1090
03:48:05,770 --> 03:48:13,930
after I clean all the grease from the fence. Just look at how much of it there is. This is

1096
03:50:05,389 --> 03:50:23,680
Hang in there. I'll take you to Chibi house now. Oh, Chibi-Robo. Wait, what? Why am I a ghost?

1097
03:50:25,040 --> 03:50:27,440
Don't freak me out like that. I got a Halloween costume.

1098
03:50:29,600 --> 03:50:56,840
New suit. Top 200. 33 more happy points and I got a new battery. Top 200 streamer. What happens when

1099
03:50:56,840 --> 03:51:16,379
I get to number one? Press Z. Chibi-Robo, you can't use Z to pose here. Fine. You get a mixer

1100
03:51:16,379 --> 03:51:33,600
contract when you get to top 200. So what's the pose? It's scary? I wonder what that does.

1101
03:51:37,069 --> 03:51:52,489
All right, back on track. Fully charged. Back on track. I need 33 more points.

1102
03:51:53,450 --> 03:52:02,829
Ow! Okay, where am I going to go? Can I go talk to dad? I feel like I haven't... Okay, I've been

1103
03:52:02,829 --> 03:52:11,000
I've been neglecting dad. Like, I need to talk to dad. We got mom's just bit... We got mom's side of

1104
03:52:11,000 --> 03:52:32,879
the story. Let's get dad's side of the story. Whoa, it's a ghost! Don't go around scaring people now,

1105
03:52:32,879 --> 03:53:03,719
you know, like my wife does. Man, that's pretty cute, Chibi-Robo. That's it. Boomer humor. I'm

1106
03:53:03,719 --> 03:53:15,819
gonna have... I think I have enough to upgrade battery. I went on the second. 4, 5, 30. Yeah,

1107
03:53:15,819 --> 03:53:31,290
I got enough. Let's go. New battery. Battery, battery, battery. More battery. More battery.

1108
03:53:40,510 --> 03:53:45,709
Get to go out. I think Otto needs to go out. He's giving me the take me out look.

1109
03:53:56,379 --> 03:54:06,000
How much more battery do I get? And upgrade happy points.

1110
03:54:07,760 --> 03:54:18,920
Your Chibi ranking has gone. I'm in the top 100. Bonus battery.

1111
03:54:23,159 --> 03:54:28,040
160. Very, very useful. 99.

1112
03:54:31,610 --> 03:54:33,690
Okay, I need 472 happy points.

1113
03:54:34,649 --> 03:54:48,840
What if I get this scrap metal? No, I'm trying to pick up the trash.

1114
03:54:56,000 --> 03:55:12,620
I want the trash. No, trash. Sorry about that, my bad. Yeah, well, I mean, you've messed

1115
03:55:12,620 --> 03:55:25,000
enough the whole house. Talk to dad in a normal outfit. Will that work? All right,

1116
03:55:25,000 --> 03:55:32,510
hold on. I gotta take Otto out in a second. You wanna go outside? Okay. I'm gonna take a little

1117
03:55:32,510 --> 03:55:41,440
break and let Mr. Otto outside. All right, dad, what can you tell me? Something to tell me?

1118
03:55:42,479 --> 03:55:46,319
Hope you make it to number one in the Chibi-Robo ranking. Oh, by the way,

1119
03:55:47,440 --> 03:55:50,479
did you pick up my garbage? Thanks, Chibi-Robo. You're a pal.

1120
03:55:57,770 --> 03:56:00,170
Dad. All right, what can I look at? Is it in the manual?

1121
03:56:01,370 --> 03:56:16,079
Is it worth it to buy an automaton? Yes. Utilibots. Chibi-Robo is very eco-conscious,

1122
03:56:16,079 --> 03:56:20,479
and so one of its primary functions is to collect scrap from around your house and recycle it.

1123
03:56:22,159 --> 03:56:25,840
While you will not see the scrap being recycled in Utilibots, please be sure that they are

1124
03:56:25,840 --> 03:56:31,680
constructed in an environmentally friendly manner. Wait, recycled products inside the

1125
03:56:31,680 --> 03:56:40,540
Recycled Lotron Chibi House. Should I be putting my trash in there? Platters, warps, bridges.

1126
03:56:42,559 --> 03:56:50,090
Studying hard. Got any metal? All right, changing suits. Let's just skip this to get free points.

1127
03:56:50,969 --> 03:56:59,579
Read the whole thing. Scrap is different from trash, okay?

1128
03:57:00,379 --> 03:57:15,659
Ah, I'm wrong. Skipping lore. We already know this. It's like 20 or 30 free points. Bonus batteries.

1129
03:57:26,600 --> 03:57:38,829
Auto has to shit. Now, he's fine. I'll leave. All right, let's go, Auto. You ready? He's like,

1130
03:57:38,829 --> 03:57:45,120
yes, I am. He's just rolling around. He's ready to go. All right, I'll be right back. Give me like,

1131
03:57:45,120 --> 04:03:00,959
I don't know, three minutes, three, four. I don't know. He might have to poop. Okay, I've returned.

1132
04:03:06,040 --> 04:03:26,079
Let's go. Bacon should be banned. The food? I don't know what that means. All right, so

1133
04:03:27,840 --> 04:03:40,430
almost time to have the day end. I still can't get up the stairs. How do I get up the stairs?

1134
04:03:41,149 --> 04:03:53,709
I think I need to buy something. Oh, wait, I'm gonna give the frog ring. I have a ring for you.

1135
04:03:58,079 --> 04:04:22,329
Give me. Yes. Can I get a cookie too? 33 happy points. Seven more. Do you want a cookie?

1136
04:04:24,350 --> 04:04:42,860
Ribbit, ribbit? No. All right. Boyer backyard kitchen. What's the current task? I have to

1137
04:04:42,860 --> 04:04:47,899
get the frog water. I have to fix their marriage. I need to get the spoon.

1138
04:04:49,100 --> 04:04:57,819
Let me talk to dad with the red. What about the Red Crest guy?

1139
04:05:03,340 --> 04:05:15,290
Easy. Yeah, that should be easy. Hey, look. Wow. A space hunter Drake Red Crest costume.

1140
04:05:16,250 --> 04:05:27,399
Good gravy. That is so cool. I want one. I want one. I want one. I

1141
04:05:27,959 --> 04:05:44,780
want one. Oh, let me see you pose. Come on. Let me see. Am I enabling dad to buy an expensive

1142
04:05:44,780 --> 04:06:05,549
cosplay outfit? Nine happy points from dad. That's it. It's a shame my wife can't understand just how

1143
04:06:05,549 --> 04:06:26,079
cool he is. Okay, maybe he is a bit weird. For a break, chibi robo. He pogged his pants.

1144
04:06:26,079 --> 04:06:53,049
That's great work out there. 84. I'm climbing. What's the gunpowder for? I got money. I got

1145
04:06:53,049 --> 04:07:09,629
money. What can I buy to help me from a suit? Another battery range chip. What's a hot rod?

1146
04:07:10,350 --> 04:07:22,909
A popular car among racers. Perhaps you will race one day. You can buy a car. It's a full

1147
04:07:22,909 --> 04:07:46,520
letter grid. I'm saving for the car. Yeah. What's going on? Did you hear that?

1148
04:07:49,149 --> 04:08:04,479
I'm scraping my ears. It came from outside. Wink. All right. It's just Mr. Red Crest

1149
04:08:04,479 --> 04:08:22,120
stomping around. What do you think that noise was? Frog ring? Blood? Wait a second. What's that?

1150
04:08:22,840 --> 04:08:43,559
Is that oil? Why is there oil in here? Investigate. Yep, that's oil. All right. I wonder where it

1151
04:08:43,559 --> 04:08:56,200
came from. Huh. From above. It's dripping from. Oh, it's just dripping from dad's fingers.

1152
04:08:58,540 --> 04:09:12,299
Uh oh. It's spider bot. Those are the things from the news. The spiders are here. Uh oh.

1153
04:09:13,629 --> 04:09:27,120
I know this move. It's the enemy spider circle. Spider roulette. This is going to be bad. Really

1154
04:09:27,120 --> 04:09:46,040
bad. Quick. Get the chibi blaster. Did I leave the oven on? Oh, scrap. That's what I think it is.

1155
04:09:46,040 --> 04:09:52,520
It's scrap. Yes. Collect enough of that and you can build a utility bot with the recyclatron.

1156
04:09:53,239 --> 04:09:57,040
Spiders are good for something after all. They're good for recycling. Tee hee hee.

1157
04:09:58,000 --> 04:10:10,600
I have enough to build a ladder. Kind of clean up their fucking mess.

1158
04:10:11,239 --> 04:10:31,790
That was brutal. That was pretty cool. All right. Here we go. Let's make the ladder. I have 300.

1159
04:10:32,350 --> 04:10:55,040
I missed a spot. Kind of cleaning robot, am I? Let's do it.

1160
04:10:58,159 --> 04:11:02,670
Okay. Chibi manual. Something to say about utility bots. Yeah, I know.

1161
04:11:03,629 --> 04:11:11,899
Welcome to the chibi pc. Recyclatron. All right. Living room ladder. A ladder that reaches high

1162
04:11:11,899 --> 04:11:27,100
places placed near the chibi robot house. Build it. Put your scrap into the recyclatron. Nice.

1163
04:11:31,879 --> 04:11:42,959
And what is it? Something came out. Set it out in the living room. I can finally reach high places.

1164
04:11:44,540 --> 04:12:00,170
Very cool. Where'd it go? Underneath that big big present sheet. Congratulations on building

1165
04:12:00,170 --> 04:12:05,959
the utility bot. Tee hee. I feel like we got a new partner. I'm so happy.

1166
04:12:08,120 --> 04:12:19,469
Abnormal activity detected while on patrol. Uh oh. Space hunter drake redcrest. Alert. Alert.

1167
04:12:22,190 --> 04:12:33,959
What have we here? Now chibi robot, are you ready? Yes. Everyone, I'd like to introduce you to the

1168
04:12:33,959 --> 04:12:52,989
newest member of the family. Ladder guy. Hey, it's me ladder guy. How are you? I'm so happy

1169
04:12:52,989 --> 04:13:03,610
to be part of the family. All right, come on. This nifty ladder utility bot will let you do all

1170
04:13:03,610 --> 04:13:11,719
sorts of things. Push or pull it in addition to raising it up and down. Isn't that something? It

1171
04:13:11,719 --> 04:13:19,979
talks, right? Drake redcrest is confused and angry, but it does not appear to be evil.

1172
04:13:21,100 --> 04:13:26,860
In addition to normal, situation peaceful. The patrol must continue.

1173
04:13:27,819 --> 04:13:36,809
Well, keep up the good work. Thank you. We can reach the high parts of the house, chibi robot.

1174
04:13:37,530 --> 04:13:41,360
I have no mouth and must scream and cannot scream.

1175
04:13:44,000 --> 04:13:53,260
I present to you my new song. Are you ready to be amazed? Sure. I, television, will now enthrall you

1176
04:13:53,260 --> 04:14:12,920
with the gift of song. This one is called teriyaki blues. I see somebody spent 20 minutes in garage

1177
04:14:12,920 --> 04:14:39,709
band as well. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Ha ha. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't cry on the new

1178
04:14:39,709 --> 04:14:51,819
equipment. I've heard you've been interrupted by a malfunction of some kind. I'm sorry you couldn't

1179
04:14:51,819 --> 04:15:09,069
hear the whole song. Thanks. Anyway, you were a great audience. Okay. What do you got to say?

1180
04:15:09,069 --> 04:15:13,709
Well, now that that's out of the way, press eight next to me and I'll lift it up. Press left and

1181
04:15:13,709 --> 04:15:28,879
right. I'll move left and right. Right? Come on. We need it. Let's hear it. Start your plug to raise

1182
04:15:28,879 --> 04:15:33,719
the ladder. If you want to lower it, tilt down. Change the ladder's direction. Plug yourself into

1183
04:15:33,719 --> 04:15:44,590
a different side. You can push or pull freely so drive moving. Okay. Okay. I get you. How far does

1184
04:15:44,590 --> 04:15:56,809
this go? Holy shit. This takes a lot of power. We're just gonna just let it go the whole thing.

1185
04:15:57,530 --> 04:16:14,270
I'll be back. You're gonna die. Yeah, that was close. Your energy is full. Would you like to save?

1186
04:16:14,270 --> 04:16:28,040
No. You're making them bankrupt. Blame dad. I'm doing my best. I'm just gonna climb it.

1187
04:16:28,200 --> 04:16:43,559
But still no memory card. Now it's okay though. We've been on it for four and a half hours or so.

1188
04:16:43,559 --> 04:16:52,989
It'll be fine. All right. We're going from here to there. Oh, look at that. That's so sad.

1189
04:16:53,709 --> 04:17:22,059
All right. Let's do it. I'll go this way. That way. One coin in here. What am I gonna take this from

1190
04:17:22,059 --> 04:17:27,579
now? All right. We can go up there. We're going up here. We're getting that frog ring. I love this

1191
04:17:27,579 --> 04:17:48,989
game. This is a fun game. Oh, shit. I can. Oh, it's very cozy. Yeah. It's just very nice. It's

1192
04:17:48,989 --> 04:17:55,920
very nice. It's not a whole lot of like stress or anything. It's just fun. Who doesn't love

1193
04:17:55,920 --> 04:18:04,639
Chibi-Robo? I don't know. I don't know who wouldn't. It seems hard to not like it. All right. Let's move

1194
04:18:04,639 --> 04:18:09,920
this this way. No, no. Wait. I'm assuming it has to be on the right. The plug has to be in the side

1195
04:18:09,920 --> 04:18:26,840
that you want to move. Wait, am I in the way? How do I move it though? Can I wait? Can I just push it?

1196
04:18:28,040 --> 04:18:41,950
You just push it. You do? No, you don't. Oh, you do? Okay. I was freaking out. That's how you tilt it.

1197
04:18:43,530 --> 04:18:56,360
It hurts. All right. We're going up. Nintendo hates it, apparently. Yeah. Nintendo did this thing

1198
04:18:56,360 --> 04:19:01,100
where they really, really, really, for some reason, want you to really like Toad because

1199
04:19:01,739 --> 04:19:05,020
they have all these cool characters and all these interesting franchises, but

1200
04:19:05,020 --> 04:19:15,629
like, please like Toad. What's wrong with Toad? You want to go over the things that are wrong with

1201
04:19:15,629 --> 04:19:34,670
Toad? I don't know if I want to do this. No, not in the same stream. You just spread this out.

1202
04:19:35,469 --> 04:19:41,760
You got to spread these out. I can't tell you that I don't like Zelda and that Toad is dumb in the

1203
04:19:41,760 --> 04:19:46,719
same stream. If I do that, I'm going to lose like 50,000 subs. So we have to spread this out over

1204
04:19:46,719 --> 04:20:09,520
the course of like 10 months. One controversy per year, Jeremy. One controversy a year. The plug-up

1205
04:20:09,520 --> 04:20:20,940
here. Oh, dude. 10 community subs from Desoid. The reverse happened. Hating Toad is not controversial.

1206
04:20:23,920 --> 04:20:29,840
I don't hate Toad. I just, I mean, there's other games they could make besides Toad's like

1207
04:20:29,840 --> 04:20:36,280
Treasure Tracker. There's like three of them. How many Toad Treasure Tracker games are there?

1208
04:20:36,920 --> 04:20:46,879
That game's great. Now imagine. No, hold on. That game's good, right? That game gets a good game.

1209
04:20:46,879 --> 04:21:00,170
Wait, what if Toad Treasure Tracker was Chibi-Robo 2? Think about that. Chibi-Robo isn't by Nintendo.

1210
04:21:00,170 --> 04:21:13,159
Chibi-Robo 2 exists. Oh, yeah, but it's on the DS, right? It's not the name. Oh, fuck. I'm on

1211
04:21:13,159 --> 04:21:20,170
battery. I'm on a set of battery here. We are dangerously low on battery. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1212
04:21:20,170 --> 04:21:30,620
Oh, my God. I think I'm gonna die. There's a plug right here, right?

1213
04:21:30,620 --> 04:21:47,850
There's a Japanese-only DS sequel that plays like the original and is a direct story continuation.

1214
04:21:49,579 --> 04:21:57,389
Why? Okay, what is with, why don't they think Western audiences like this? I don't get it.

1215
04:21:58,190 --> 04:22:04,239
This is, why wouldn't they? Why would it not come out in America and in Europe and stuff?

1216
04:22:04,959 --> 04:22:23,719
Because of translations. It's because they lose money on a translation.

1217
04:22:28,959 --> 04:22:33,870
Um, is this high enough? I think I have to go down. Can I go any higher?

1218
04:22:35,389 --> 04:22:38,270
I don't think I can. No, I'm gonna have to go back down.

1219
04:22:43,899 --> 04:22:58,860
It's also localization. American-only. I want gun, burger, and car. What are you talking about?

1220
04:22:59,819 --> 04:23:15,659
That's as high as it goes? Come on. All right, let's move it down here because I want to get

1221
04:23:15,659 --> 04:23:30,250
up to there, up there. All right. Can I like retract the club? Club, the plug.

1222
04:23:30,969 --> 04:23:38,840
Do you guys understand how fucked up my brain is? I just said plug backwards, essentially.

1223
04:23:50,799 --> 04:24:22,620
Gulp. The plug. Too high. Too high. Too high. I'm so fucked up, man. Relax. Drink some water.

1224
04:24:22,620 --> 04:24:39,680
Oh, man. I'm so fucked up. I don't even know, man. What was the point of coming up here this high?

1225
04:24:40,920 --> 04:24:49,520
Hmm. Demon door right there. Ooh, demon door. And another way to go. Ooh, can I climb up this?

1226
04:24:54,920 --> 04:25:04,139
Shit. All right. There's nothing up here. Just a plug. Wait. Weed, dude. Weed, weed, weed, weed,

1227
04:25:04,219 --> 04:25:37,159
pog, weed, dude. Weed, pog. Can I open this? Ooh, happy point. Okay, so from here, can I do anything

1228
04:25:37,159 --> 04:25:56,909
else? I guess I can go down a little. Dude, epicness. Epicness. Epicness. Demon door? Yeah,

1229
04:25:56,909 --> 04:26:00,750
I've already gotten it. There's a demon door back here. I have to push this back.

1230
04:26:02,860 --> 04:26:26,860
So much to explore. We're going up to the telephone. Sure, you just won the internet.

1231
04:26:29,079 --> 04:27:01,049
Whatever. Oh, can I use the phone? Thank you for the gold. You know, I didn't know what the

1232
04:27:01,049 --> 04:27:24,879
hell that did or what it meant or what it was until seven or eight months ago. There's a ring

1233
04:27:24,879 --> 04:27:28,329
up there. There's a plug up there, too. All right, I'm going to move this back again. We're going to

1234
04:27:28,329 --> 04:27:38,239
go here. Can I reach this? Nothing on this side of the phone. Can I climb? I can't climb that. What?

1235
04:27:38,239 --> 04:27:57,799
Uh, remember, say three. Three. Who cares? Why don't you stream on Reddit?

1236
04:28:01,790 --> 04:28:17,020
Reddit live. Holy crap, two golds. This blew up. I don't, I still don't even get what it means.

1237
04:28:20,719 --> 04:28:27,200
So, okay, I want to repeat this so I can make sure I get this right. Stop throwing shit at me.

1238
04:28:30,969 --> 04:28:37,610
So, Reddit has a system where you upvote stuff. So, okay, let's say somebody makes a comment

1239
04:28:37,690 --> 04:28:41,049
and that comment, people, a lot of people agree with it and they, a hundred people press the

1240
04:28:41,049 --> 04:28:47,209
button to go up. Yeah, and that's one of the top kind of comments, top posts, right? So, somebody

1241
04:28:47,209 --> 04:28:55,049
can pay money to put a stamp on that post, right? And that just, that's it. It's just somebody

1242
04:28:55,049 --> 04:29:01,530
decided to be like, holy shit, I loved what you said so much that I paid 44 cents for it, right?

1243
04:29:01,530 --> 04:29:10,090
Or something like 20, a dollar or something, right? Is that what it means? And then they get

1244
04:29:10,090 --> 04:29:27,870
some website perks, okay? It's five dollars. All right, so it's five dollars, okay? And then

1245
04:29:27,870 --> 04:29:33,149
how long does that last? So, let's say I wrote something on a thread and I got, I got gold.

1246
04:29:33,149 --> 04:29:37,309
Somebody was like, holy, well, dude, I don't know who it was, but thanks. How long do I get gold

1247
04:29:37,309 --> 04:30:02,510
status for? Wait, the TV shows a month. Can I do something with the TV right now? But it doesn't

1248
04:30:02,510 --> 04:30:17,799
do anything. You get paid, you get, it's a, to browse Reddit ad free. Can I put this up to press

1249
04:30:17,799 --> 04:30:43,159
the button or something? Well, here we are. Let's go. Let's go. Nothing on TV. What the fuck?

1250
04:30:43,879 --> 04:31:32,760
Nothing on fucking TV. What the hell? Well, okay. Go inside the TV. What do I get in the TV? Remember,

1251
04:31:32,760 --> 04:31:37,079
you're about to get 10 million views. Already got it. We already got it like a couple hours

1252
04:31:37,079 --> 04:31:50,239
ago and it was crazy. I popped a bottle of champagne. It was nuts. I still need to get over

1253
04:31:50,239 --> 04:31:58,989
here. Hold on. Turn this around. Can I make the platform just be here so I can? All right. Now

1254
04:31:58,989 --> 04:32:23,790
bring it down. There's a hole in that wall over there. Whoa. Burn it up. I can probably blast that

1255
04:32:23,790 --> 04:32:49,479
wall. Let's get it closer. All right. Let's get it down here and yeah, that's it. Let's go. Yep.

1256
04:32:51,120 --> 04:32:54,879
No, I don't want to go to bed. I don't want to go to bed. I don't want to go to bed. I don't want

1257
04:32:54,879 --> 04:33:07,599
to go to bed. So anyways, um, Reddit, they pay Reddit gold to somebody and they get some perks

1258
04:33:07,599 --> 04:33:25,049
for the website and they know who, but they don't know who it was. So anyways, Reddit, rank 80.

1259
04:33:25,689 --> 04:33:54,200
Get off Reddit and go to bed. That's why they say thanks for the gold, kind stranger. Let's see.

1260
04:33:55,159 --> 04:34:14,650
Whoa. Pretty cool. Thank you, kind sir. Thank you for the gift sub, kind stranger. Thank you for

1261
04:34:14,650 --> 04:34:52,889
the gift sub, kind stranger. Boom. And brought coin. Thanks for the wink, kind stranger. Yeah,

1262
04:34:52,889 --> 04:34:58,349
whatever. Yeah, whatever. All right. Let's get on top of the chair.

1263
04:35:05,880 --> 04:35:11,959
And then we're going to go over there. There's a lot of places to go with this.

1264
04:35:12,680 --> 04:35:29,919
Real wink. Let me check. Let me verify it. Okay. It was real. My eyes are so red. I don't know why.

1265
04:35:30,639 --> 04:35:56,439
I can climb this shit. Clean the trash up here. How come some people get full face cam winks and

1266
04:35:56,439 --> 04:36:03,340
other people only get a tiny window of a wink? It's the same thing. See, it's the same thing.

1267
04:36:03,340 --> 04:36:22,270
All right. 50 cents. Reddit silver versus Reddit gold. You guys are fucking crazy.

1268
04:36:24,270 --> 04:36:33,819
All right. Have I gotten everything in here? All the demon doors and everything.

1269
04:36:39,180 --> 04:36:46,319
Pouch behind dad's head. Demon door up there. Next to the clock. We haven't gone over there yet.

1270
04:36:46,959 --> 04:36:52,560
What about on the table? I haven't been on the table. How have I not been on the table?

1271
04:36:53,279 --> 04:37:07,389
That seems absurd, right? That's absurd. It's a full screen wink for 150 million dollars.

1272
04:37:08,349 --> 04:37:32,520
All right, dad. Oh, he's running out of power. Plug into dad's head.

1273
04:37:43,930 --> 04:37:47,560
You didn't even give me my wink. You turned the camera on and said,

1274
04:37:48,279 --> 04:37:53,209
if you get a wink. Nope. And then end of the stream. I was heartbroken and despondent. I

1275
04:37:53,209 --> 04:38:12,459
won't be redeeming a wink again. I want to get the, uh, the thing. I want to go on the table.

1276
04:38:13,259 --> 04:38:27,069
Let's make it easy. Omega Lala. I'm sure germ is upset to hear that. Why are you making me some

1277
04:38:27,069 --> 04:38:40,970
kind of villain? Why am I a villain? Is this the highest this shit goes? Like, oh, I'm sure germ is

1278
04:38:40,970 --> 04:38:50,970
so sad to hear that. Oh, I'm going to turn the CD off and then dad's going to freak out, right?

1279
04:38:51,770 --> 04:39:16,349
Just barely. Candy bar wrappers. Cookie box. That's going to freak out. All right,

1280
04:39:16,349 --> 04:39:28,250
turn the TV back on. Did he figure out how to pronounce refuse yet? That's how,

1281
04:39:28,250 --> 04:39:50,939
that's what that word sounds like to me. This is way too high. Oh wait, he's on top of the TV.

1282
04:39:50,939 --> 04:40:11,240
Should I talk to him first? Look up, you fool. I know, but I'm not tall enough to get over there.

1283
04:40:11,240 --> 04:40:25,900
I know there's a frog going over there. All right, I'm turning this TV off. All right, dad.

1284
04:40:25,900 --> 04:40:46,189
You're going to have to find something else to do. TV's going off. Hey, hold it. Hold it. Whoa.

1285
04:40:46,909 --> 04:41:01,740
Space Hunter Drake Red Crest is on. Dad just gave you 19 happy points.

1286
04:41:04,669 --> 04:41:23,290
How can I get a three shirt? No, Ribbit. Chibi-ro-bit. That was close. Ribbit. Oh,

1287
04:41:23,290 --> 04:41:50,720
do you want one of these? I have one. Ribbit, maybe? Yes. Yay, a bit. 13 happy points. Ribbit,

1288
04:41:50,720 --> 04:42:16,599
Gibby. Cookie box. You're encouraging her too much. This isn't Monster Rancher. Six more. Ribbit.

1289
04:42:17,639 --> 04:42:28,970
All right, good. Where else do I need here? Up there. Up there, up here. I can't, I don't think

1290
04:42:28,970 --> 04:42:45,279
I can reach up there though. There's a frog ring in there. I'm getting it. Can I get it? Mr. Wink?

1291
04:42:45,279 --> 04:43:08,270
I just did it. There. Two Winks? I got the one from before too. The one from like 10 minutes

1292
04:43:08,270 --> 04:43:27,180
ago. I got it. No, this one on the other hand, I didn't get. Shit. It's just barely not tall enough.

1293
04:43:27,180 --> 04:43:41,919
Come on. Wait. All right. I have a plan. My plan is to push that onto here. No, it's not going to

1294
04:43:41,919 --> 04:43:52,169
work. Does he not know it's on? Whatever. Do you think I care about the webcam being on? I'm a

1295
04:43:52,169 --> 04:44:06,560
streamer. It should be on. He doesn't know. You guys shouldn't have said anything. You would have

1296
04:44:06,560 --> 04:44:10,479
got me fucking putting my finger up my nose or like biting my lip and like eating boogers or

1297
04:44:10,479 --> 04:44:18,159
something. You guys fucked that up. Big time. I really did not know it was still on and you could

1298
04:44:18,159 --> 04:44:24,080
have seen like a booger reading. Wow. You, one opportunity in like seven years. That was it and

1299
04:44:24,080 --> 04:44:30,959
you ruined it. You've, you just missed a full booger being swallowed. I can't believe it.

1300
04:44:51,680 --> 04:45:00,939
Oh, Chibi Robo. I love it. All right. I'm going to bring, can I bring this thing into other rooms?

1301
04:45:01,580 --> 04:45:25,240
Redeemed a German booger. Dude, hog super frog voice. So this can't go up any higher.

1302
04:45:26,119 --> 04:45:43,159
For real. All right. Go up. Shit. All right. I think I've done everything I can do with

1303
04:45:43,159 --> 04:45:49,439
how tall this is. Maybe not. Wait over there. Jeremy, you missed two boogers.

1304
04:45:50,400 --> 04:45:54,560
If I had a booger eating channel point redemption, I wouldn't be able to produce

1305
04:45:54,560 --> 04:46:21,580
that many boogers. What are you talking about? I know this dirt over here. I'm trying to get up

1306
04:46:21,580 --> 04:46:44,400
there. Oh, okay. All right. You got, okay. You guys are starting to disgust me.

1307
04:46:45,599 --> 04:47:11,930
You're starting to disgust me. Nothing in here. I'm just barely not going to be able to make this.

1308
04:47:12,569 --> 04:47:37,419
Come on. Yes, I can. No. What? What? Are you kidding me? I can't make this. Really? That's so sad.

1309
04:47:45,979 --> 04:48:00,729
I'm done. I'm done with this game. I'm done with this game. Wait, there's a book here. Hey,

1310
04:48:00,729 --> 04:48:07,549
it's a photo album. Neat. Do you want to check it out? Yeah. I'm done with this game. You're

1311
04:48:07,549 --> 04:48:15,979
having a barbecue. Sniff. I never get tired of looking at photos. Don't I have a photograph?

1312
04:48:17,900 --> 04:48:26,090
I'm having a barbecue. Don't I have? I have a picture. Can I put it in there?

1313
04:48:29,840 --> 04:48:45,880
I guess I can't put it in. All right. I think that's all I could do with that.

1314
04:48:45,880 --> 04:48:50,889
There's not much else I can. I got to do some cleaning. Anything else I can get with this

1315
04:48:50,889 --> 04:49:00,720
ladder? Bad streamer. I think I got everything I can get. Maybe up this way? Have I done

1316
04:49:00,720 --> 04:49:12,250
anything up there? Let's check. Lady Powas. Wait, is the Powas over here? What's the plug over here?

1317
04:49:13,049 --> 04:50:09,869
I'm not giving in. I'm not giving in. I'm not giving into this shit. That's all I can do. I

1318
04:50:09,869 --> 04:50:31,240
can't get up there. Not yet. Oh, then we're gonna do some cleaning and I should have enough points

1319
04:50:31,240 --> 04:50:56,720
to upgrade again, right? Is Otto a... Otto's doing just fine. He's over here. He's hanging up.

1320
04:50:59,159 --> 04:51:14,970
Cleaning time. Like a good robo. Wait, I can go upstairs. I have the ladder. No, I don't.

1321
04:51:15,209 --> 04:51:23,639
Cleaned up a total of 135 stains. Hardware cleaning. Happy points.

1322
04:51:30,110 --> 04:51:37,819
Oh, happy points. Doing the super frog noise.

1323
04:51:41,639 --> 04:52:03,400
Somebody was outside with their muddy shoes. Okay. A bit more over here. I gotta be close. What about

1324
04:52:03,400 --> 04:52:19,099
outside? I'm kind of stuck with what I should do next. Let me see. Let me see what's available to

1325
04:52:19,099 --> 04:52:40,970
buy. Missed a stain. I'll be fine. Upload those happy points.

1326
04:52:51,759 --> 04:53:00,360
55. I'm almost in the top 50. How much do I have? Do I have enough for the car?

1327
04:53:01,319 --> 04:53:26,909
Yeah, nice booger image. I saw it. How much is the car? Hot rod. 2740.

1328
04:53:28,349 --> 04:53:35,959
I'm almost there. I'm going outside. I feel like I haven't explored outside a whole lot.

1329
04:53:41,080 --> 04:53:57,639
Outside is... Why did I say the booger thing? That's on me. That's a mistake. I have to remember.

1330
04:53:58,599 --> 04:54:03,790
I have to remember that there's a bunch of people here that are going to say it and repeat it.

1331
04:54:03,790 --> 04:54:13,150
And again, it's going to follow me around. Okay. We need something out here.

1332
04:54:19,580 --> 04:54:54,459
Fighters! See you next time on Dragon Ball Z. It's find out next time. Fuck. No, now they're

1333
04:54:54,459 --> 04:54:59,020
going to know I've never seen one full episode of the show. And all they know... They're going to

1334
04:54:59,020 --> 04:55:05,500
know that the only thing I've ever done is I've YouTubeed random scenes from Dragon Ball Super

1335
04:55:05,500 --> 04:55:12,430
for no reason. I've watched a bunch of Beerus stuff for no reason. I have no intention to watch

1336
04:55:12,430 --> 04:55:37,900
the show. I don't know why I did that. They're going to know this. Backyard. Did you watch JoJo

1337
04:55:37,900 --> 04:56:18,779
though? No. Still haven't given the frog any water. This is so sad. It's actually sad.

1338
04:56:19,180 --> 04:56:28,029
Why hasn't somebody like picked up the frog? Where's the family? All dad does is watch cartoons

1339
04:56:28,029 --> 04:56:50,700
all day. Oh, shit. Frog coin. Wait, this means shoot. This means shoot this... Shoot this. This

1340
04:56:50,700 --> 04:57:31,130
dog bone over there. Donald Duck. Can I pick this up? Wait, why can't I pick this up? It's stuck in

1341
04:57:32,650 --> 04:58:07,709
the goddamn ground. I need to dig it up. Metroidvania. There's a demon door up here.

1342
04:58:07,709 --> 04:58:20,080
There's a spider nest up here. Open the demon door. Remember, you're very likeable and admirable.

1343
04:58:20,080 --> 04:58:33,599
What's up? Thank you. The spider's nest. Can I shoot it?

1344
04:58:39,240 --> 04:59:06,029
Fuck out of here. Singalata. Sleeping baby birds. Hello? He's in a deep sleep. If he

1345
04:59:06,029 --> 04:59:31,580
doesn't move, we can't get to the other side. How do we wake up the bird? Recycle the bird.

1346
04:59:31,580 --> 04:59:38,720
I don't think it works like that. There's another demon door here. I gotta be careful though.

1347
04:59:42,000 --> 05:00:30,799
I can buy the car. Can I go anywhere else? I can go over there. What's that? Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1348
05:00:30,799 --> 05:00:53,080
Where's the plug? Where's the outlet? It's just right here. Where is it? Isn't it right? I thought

1349
05:00:53,080 --> 05:01:02,200
it was right here. It's a plug right here. Isn't there? Where is it? There's no outlets outside.

1350
05:01:02,200 --> 05:01:34,409
No! I have a battery, right? Okay, my battery. Oh, the battery is consumed. Shit.

1351
05:01:37,229 --> 05:01:41,549
Oh my fucking god. I just lost like $600.

1352
05:01:41,549 --> 05:02:17,689
I've only died twice in five hours. Come on. You're making a fucking mess. Wait, how much?

1353
05:02:23,500 --> 05:02:28,380
For your ladder. Oh, I'm gonna, okay. It's daytime. We're gonna go kill some spiders and make a ladder

1354
05:02:28,380 --> 05:02:40,680
of the foyer. Your chibi bank account is chibi low. All right, I need to do.

1355
05:02:41,959 --> 05:02:59,770
Fuck, I'm so mad. I have to go kill spiders. I'm just gonna clean. They have to be there. I have

1356
05:02:59,770 --> 05:03:15,950
to go up in the backyard during the day. It's okay, Derma. Everything is gonna heal. Time for some

1357
05:03:15,950 --> 05:03:37,770
chibi tax evasion. All right, any spiders in the foyer? I need scrap. Maybe you should crash the

1358
05:03:37,770 --> 05:04:02,009
chibi housing market. Chibi gamble all your money away. I can't even do anything in here.

1359
05:04:02,569 --> 05:04:17,119
I need to get attacked by spiders and then we ran out of time last time. Can I go back to bed?

1360
05:04:17,759 --> 05:04:25,720
Would I dress up as chibi for a Halloween special? Talk to the eggs? Wait, I didn't already do that?

1361
05:04:26,520 --> 05:04:38,909
How does one dress up as chibi robo? Private Vegas reporting for duty. Uh-huh.

1362
05:04:40,169 --> 05:04:43,290
You know that beautiful hunk of hot rods sitting up on the second floor?

1363
05:04:44,639 --> 05:04:53,529
Yeah. You got a good eye on you, kid. Uh-huh. I've got a tricked out hot rod. When my tour with the

1364
05:04:53,529 --> 05:05:30,279
free rangers ends, I'm gonna be a race car driver. Sounds pretty cool, Vegas. The broomer. All right,

1365
05:05:30,919 --> 05:05:41,930
he's gonna waste time until tomorrow so I can attack by spiders outside. I think I'm done with

1366
05:05:41,930 --> 05:05:50,889
the game. I'm done with this game. It's like, all right. It's like fun, but yeah, it was like,

1367
05:05:50,889 --> 05:06:03,819
all right. Are you gonna stream it again? Um, I don't know. Like maybe. It's like maybe. It's

1368
05:06:03,819 --> 05:06:08,919
like possible. It's not like a priority, but like maybe. I don't know. I'm not like, you know what

1369
05:06:08,919 --> 05:06:41,709
I mean? Pranked! Pranked! All right, let's go back in here. Can I get to the spoon? I can't

1370
05:06:41,709 --> 05:06:55,450
probably until I get the ladder in there. 61. All right, I don't need to go to bed.

1371
05:06:56,700 --> 05:07:03,580
I don't want to save. Where's the sleep button? Can I just go to bed? How do I shut off?

1372
05:07:05,799 --> 05:07:09,080
All right, chibi robo, smash your head against the wall as hard as you can.

1373
05:07:09,080 --> 05:07:22,540
I'll put the put the costume on. That's a costume you can get. Oh, you force the next day with a

1374
05:07:22,540 --> 05:07:51,360
costume. Wait, can't I just do this? Just buy the shorter clock. I could do that.

1375
05:07:55,450 --> 05:07:59,529
This is probably something else I can do just to pass the time. Oh, let me like clean up some

1376
05:08:00,090 --> 05:08:25,680
junk. Let me pick up some Cheetos on this guy's fucking couch. The dog's on here. Can we talk to

1377
05:08:25,680 --> 05:08:38,779
the dog? I guess not. Talk to the eggs again. All right, I'll get out there after I get these, uh,

1378
05:08:38,779 --> 05:09:24,599
coins. And we get the boots. I kind of wonder what this face looks like. How about some trash?

1379
05:09:26,639 --> 05:10:03,200
Put the camera on again. If I laugh, he doesn't know. If I laugh, if I laugh, if I face, he doesn't

1380
05:10:03,200 --> 05:10:12,459
know. Doesn't know. Medic, we've got a robo down. Wait a second, you're not hurt at all.

1381
05:10:13,419 --> 05:10:28,799
That is one sick joke, soldier. Ah, TV Robo, I knew that was you. You can't scare a grizzled

1382
05:10:28,799 --> 05:11:00,970
veteran like me. Wait, TV Robo, I knew that was you. Space Hunter Drake Redcrest. Oh boy,

1383
05:11:00,970 --> 05:11:17,689
could you, uh, autograph my, my, uh, oh man, I'm so nervous. Private Frisco on dirty, sir.

1384
05:11:18,650 --> 05:11:27,819
Freed Rangers rule one. When the Sarge gives an order, you say, sir. Yes, sir. I'm Tex. Sarge

1385
05:11:27,819 --> 05:11:33,979
had the free Rangers photo last, but he lost it. That photo has to be around here somewhere. I have

1386
05:11:33,979 --> 05:11:43,630
it. I'm Tex. Sarge had the wifi photo last, but he lost it. I have it.

1387
05:12:08,200 --> 05:12:22,220
We took this back when we were first deployed at the Sanderson house.

1388
05:12:22,860 --> 05:12:34,090
General Sanderson took this photo. We were a full platoon then. That was before the incident.

1389
05:12:35,450 --> 05:13:21,000
We were doing our daily physical training routine. Okay, that's when the enemy attacked. The dog.

1390
05:13:47,080 --> 05:14:20,459
Ooh, he's gonna eat him. Memphis. I know what's gotta be done. We have to train harder so that

1391
05:14:20,540 --> 05:14:23,900
one day we will win the war against the great beast.

1392
05:14:25,979 --> 05:14:33,819
We need to make sure we never lose another Ranger in battle. Thank you,

1393
05:14:33,819 --> 05:14:40,400
Cheapie Robo. You helped me remember my true purpose. 20 happy points.

1394
05:14:41,840 --> 05:14:48,380
Where are the happiness? Anything else? Slap me with a landmine sandwich.

1395
05:14:49,959 --> 05:15:11,259
We're still a man short. You're slacking. Start over again. Initiate roll call. Sound off.

1396
05:15:13,080 --> 05:15:25,080
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen,

1397
05:15:26,830 --> 05:15:37,020
fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen. Everyone is accounted for, sir.

1398
05:15:38,299 --> 05:15:44,590
Show up for roll call or the whole army suffers. It looks like everyone's here,

1399
05:15:44,590 --> 05:15:57,979
so today's your lucky day. No one suffers. 20 happy points. Good, roll call is officially done.

1400
05:15:59,240 --> 05:16:09,680
Go, go, go. We're getting physical training. What do we have to do for physical training?

1401
05:16:09,680 --> 05:16:25,950
Have to do this too? I'm Montana. We're working out. I'm Orlando. Private Memphis used to stand

1402
05:16:25,950 --> 05:16:30,909
right there. Now the Sarge screams at us every day at roll call. It's all because he's gone.

1403
05:16:31,869 --> 05:16:48,459
I'm Cincy. We're working out. I'm Oregon. Sarge still talks about Private Memphis all the time.

1404
05:16:49,419 --> 05:16:58,400
I'm Tucson. Free Ranger's rule number five. Failing to follow orders is punishable by

1405
05:16:58,400 --> 05:17:22,810
scrambling. I'll rest until the great hairy threat is defeated. All right, fighters. All right,

1406
05:17:22,810 --> 05:17:55,740
gentlemen, army, roll out. Let's go. I have enough to build the foyer thing. Thanks for nothing, guys.

1407
05:17:55,740 --> 05:18:08,299
I'm gonna do this.

1408
05:18:11,000 --> 05:18:20,380
This is the resting. Hey, it looks like you found yourself a nice place to rest.

1409
05:18:22,139 --> 05:18:25,580
Oh, you still have work to do. Make hay while the sun shines.

1410
05:18:26,220 --> 05:18:45,950
No, I think I'm gonna just take a break. That was nice.

1411
05:18:45,950 --> 05:18:58,880
I'm gonna make myself happy. You know, Chibi-Robo is all about spreading happiness. But what about

1412
05:18:58,880 --> 05:19:04,479
Chibi-Robo's happiness? Don't we need to be concerned about that too? What about that?

1413
05:19:07,130 --> 05:19:26,919
Let's buy the new ladder. He's a robot. He has no feelings.

1414
05:19:27,880 --> 05:19:32,840
But what if he still has to? His joints have to rest. His robot joints. Otherwise,

1415
05:19:32,840 --> 05:19:36,279
we're gonna overwork him and he's gonna break. There you go. There's your reason.

1416
05:19:36,279 --> 05:20:16,189
I gotta be in the top 30. 43. It's time to make the ladder. For your ladder. Let's go.

1417
05:20:19,770 --> 05:20:40,880
50 streamer. Oh, man. Seriously. Damn. You're still going with this game. Wow. This is like

1418
05:20:40,880 --> 05:20:47,659
one of the most classic video games ever made. This is, this didn't just like come out in the

1419
05:20:48,459 --> 05:20:53,560
second new release page on Steam. You know, like not, you know, you don't

1420
05:20:53,560 --> 05:21:08,909
guys know what I'm talking about. This won an Oscar. I don't think we have enough time,

1421
05:21:08,909 --> 05:21:13,790
but I want to go see it. Let's go to the foyer. Oh, it's, yeah, that's right. Let's go, go, go.

1422
05:21:13,790 --> 05:21:28,619
This won five game of the year awards. What's wrong with, uh, Falcon? What are you doing standing

1423
05:21:28,619 --> 05:21:40,250
here? Island's Fool. An ill wind blows tonight. Has something happened to Mr. and Mrs. Sanderson?

1424
05:21:41,500 --> 05:21:48,319
Break Red Crest also heard Jenny weep large, bitter tears. Pursue sadness. I will continue

1425
05:21:48,319 --> 05:22:15,040
my patrol upstairs. An ill wind. All right, let's go. It's got a lot to explore today.

1426
05:22:16,319 --> 05:22:37,720
I'll set it up for tomorrow. Go over here. What is that? A stain? Not on my watch.

1427
05:22:38,439 --> 05:23:24,639
Let's juice it up. Oh, can I get anything from there? Yeah. Well, I can get the cookies.

1428
05:23:27,360 --> 05:23:40,439
Move it back a bit. Was it hitting the, is it hitting the thing?

1429
05:23:42,569 --> 05:23:54,639
How's he stuck? He's stuck. I gotta put him down.

1430
05:23:54,639 --> 05:24:22,639
All right. Ah, this game's noises are 10 out of 10. They are actually really good. They're very

1431
05:24:22,639 --> 05:24:44,889
good. Good morning. I'm fucking doing that. Don't do that anymore. Look what you're doing.

1432
05:24:44,889 --> 05:24:58,490
Still 43 Omega Low. Yeah, whatever. No, I want to pick up the trash.

1433
05:25:08,560 --> 05:25:22,860
I'm just leaving it. Oh, people were saying that if I'm going to do GameCube,

1434
05:25:22,860 --> 05:25:29,520
I should get Cubivore. Now that's a very interesting thing to say. I looked up Cubivore.

1435
05:25:29,520 --> 05:25:34,479
It was like, wow, that seems interesting. I think the game is $300. Is it worth,

1436
05:25:34,479 --> 05:25:51,930
is it worth $300? It's a $300 game. You could emulate it. Is this on Dolphin? No,

1437
05:25:51,930 --> 05:25:59,450
this is on original hardware. But all right, but if it's $300, is that, I mean, these are going to

1438
05:25:59,450 --> 05:26:04,009
appreciate in value. If I, if I hold like a, this is Chibi-Robo. This game is worth like a hundred

1439
05:26:04,009 --> 05:26:16,139
bucks. In 10 years, this game's going to be worth like 500 bucks. These are assets. All right,

1440
05:26:16,139 --> 05:26:27,450
where's, I need to go to the foyer straight ahead. Like is Cubivore going to be a thousand dollars

1441
05:26:27,450 --> 05:26:47,180
in 2028? That's Beanie Baby logic. I'm not so sure about that because these people still want to

1442
05:26:47,180 --> 05:27:09,560
play these old games on the original hardware in quotes. Only ones in mint condition will be worth

1443
05:27:09,560 --> 05:27:17,310
it. Have you seen the condition of this disc? Would you be willing to take a thousand dollars

1444
05:27:17,310 --> 05:27:20,990
from someone for this game? I'd be willing to look at who's giving me a telephone call.

1445
05:27:20,990 --> 05:27:31,439
Well, I don't, I don't know. What's, if someone's going to pay me a thousand dollars for this game,

1446
05:27:31,439 --> 05:27:38,700
would I do it? Yes, absolutely. Why wouldn't I? You mean like right now? Why wouldn't I do that?

1447
05:27:38,700 --> 05:27:48,270
All right, we're going to go, uh, where do I want to take this letter? Okay, go up on the sofa. Red

1448
05:27:48,270 --> 05:28:12,040
block. My Cubivore still has the $20 sticker on it. Wait, I can't go on the carpet. Uh-oh, I have to

1449
05:28:13,500 --> 05:28:35,290
shit. Use it right here. Hold on, I gotta put it up. What if somebody gets the rights to this game

1450
05:28:35,290 --> 05:28:48,000
and plans to make a million copies? Well, um, this thing's going up way higher than it did before.

1451
05:28:48,799 --> 05:28:55,869
I need an outlet now. So you're saying that somebody's going to buy the rights to Chibi

1452
05:28:55,869 --> 05:29:13,580
Robo and then flood the market with Chibi Robo discs. What's happened with Nancy Drew?

1453
05:29:15,790 --> 05:29:50,650
Wait, you know, you can sell, yeah. Okay. What's the rights to Chibi Robo? Oh shit, I have to hold on.

1454
05:29:52,520 --> 05:30:17,099
Fly, fly, fly. Look at the trash. God, I'm so pissed off. I have the rights. Do you really? Holy shit.

1455
05:30:18,299 --> 05:30:26,799
What? No way. That's fucking crazy, dude. Get out of here. Yeah, the person that owns it is here.

1456
05:30:29,840 --> 05:30:36,860
That's so fucking sick, man. What was it like working on the game?

1457
05:30:51,130 --> 05:30:55,240
All right, now what can I, I can't do anything with this, but the

1458
05:30:56,200 --> 05:31:06,360
Millennium Falcon thing and I fly over there. Let's get a good view and go up there.

1459
05:31:07,319 --> 05:31:23,959
I wonder if I can make it to the red block. Upstairs time. Pog. Not yet. I'm not really into

1460
05:31:23,959 --> 05:31:27,959
the game. Like I'm just going to say it. You know what I mean? Like I should have made that fucking

1461
05:31:27,959 --> 05:31:44,669
jump. I think I'm done. Let's go even hot. No, pull back. He's just doing this joke for the third time.

1462
05:31:44,830 --> 05:32:02,680
I'm going to move this out of the way. Stop. Maybe he means it this time. No, it's not even stuck on

1463
05:32:02,680 --> 05:32:13,259
anything. It's not even stuck on anything. I just saw, I just did it. It's not stuck on anything.

1464
05:32:13,819 --> 05:32:44,380
Stop going up. Chibi. Chibi. Pull it. What the fuck is going on here? Why is it just going up?

1465
05:32:55,840 --> 05:33:19,740
I did lower it when I lowered it five, six times and it went back up on its own.

1466
05:33:19,740 --> 05:33:33,389
Get the fuck over here. Stop going up. Stop going up. It's going, it's going.

1467
05:33:42,159 --> 05:33:49,290
And when I let go of the stick, it goes back up. Yeah. Stop it. This is going back up. It better

1468
05:33:49,290 --> 05:34:26,110
not be. Grab. More. Of course I'm out of fucking power. It doesn't even read chat. Yes, I do.

1469
05:34:28,279 --> 05:34:52,700
I see it. That was just, I was in, I just rewound. How long have I been streaming? Oh,

1470
05:34:53,819 --> 05:35:18,889
probably one of the longer ones. Like 13 hours. 12 and a half, 13 hours. All the way past the plants.

1471
05:35:18,889 --> 05:35:55,159
That's as high as it can go. Recharge. Streams with lifetime. Five hours and 36 minutes. Well,

1472
05:35:55,159 --> 05:36:00,159
I mean, it's going to say that because I disconnected like four or five times. So

1473
05:36:01,740 --> 05:36:19,549
flat. I mean, this is probably the stream. I have to disconnect. I mean like four. Three. It's three.

1474
05:36:19,549 --> 05:36:36,060
Yeah. Well, we definitely can't get up there. We can get over there. We can get up to the,

1475
05:36:36,060 --> 05:36:43,689
all right. Can't move this out of the way. Maybe I, yes I can. Oh, this is so, so addicting. Stop

1476
05:36:43,689 --> 05:37:04,040
being so addicting. I have to move the, I gotta move the ladder across the whole thing. Trash.

1477
05:37:04,119 --> 05:37:06,840
There's one of these. I can push it over there.

1478
05:37:09,000 --> 05:37:35,770
Okay. Break the photo. You fucking monster. I'm not going upstairs yet. I want to get that demon

1479
05:37:35,770 --> 05:37:54,720
door. I want to get the demon door across. Speak to the eggs. I will. You're running out of time.

1480
05:37:54,720 --> 05:37:59,049
All right. All right. Just wait. I'm not, there's no such thing as running out of time.

1481
05:38:00,009 --> 05:38:04,779
I'll come back in the next, tomorrow. It's fine. I'm going to kick your ass.

1482
05:38:05,840 --> 05:38:26,669
Oh, are you? Okay. Do you want to do some spy training? Yes, of course I do. Find the spy.

1483
05:38:27,630 --> 05:38:36,650
You're free rangers. You're hard-boiled. I'm Detroit. I'm Tex. I'm Frisco. I'm Orlando. I'm

1484
05:38:36,650 --> 05:38:56,220
the spy. Hunt down the spy. I know who the spy is. Got you. Two happy points. Holy shit. What?

1485
05:38:56,220 --> 05:39:11,919
That wasn't even worth doing. All right. I'm the spy. Oh, I think I might have lost it.

1486
05:39:12,560 --> 05:39:17,419
It's one again. One again.

1487
05:39:37,130 --> 05:39:37,450
Again.

1488
05:40:01,279 --> 05:40:26,090
Oh, you didn't even fucking move. I'm the spy. All right. Let's go again. I'm Detroit.

1489
05:40:26,729 --> 05:40:53,799
I'm Tex. I'm the spy. Three. You got me. All right. Just gave you two happy points.

1490
05:40:57,080 --> 05:41:04,330
Number three. Let's go. I'm standing in the fucking way. I'm Tex. I'm Frisco.

1491
05:41:04,970 --> 05:41:42,110
I'm Orlando and I'm the spy. Two. Two. Four happy points. Number four? I thought he said do it three

1492
05:41:42,110 --> 05:42:03,360
times in a row. I fucking lost it. I think it's two. I think it's one. It's three. I wish I was

1493
05:42:03,360 --> 05:42:25,209
standing in the way. Three, I think. Let's do the three or one. Yeah, I got this one. Five happy

1494
05:42:25,209 --> 05:42:31,610
points. Let's do this again. Ready to sharpen up. Five. Okay. I'm going to need you guys' help for

1495
05:42:31,610 --> 05:43:10,090
this one. Four. Four. Got it. How many times did you do this in a row? Seven happy points.

1496
05:43:22,159 --> 05:43:47,680
Okay. Two. I think it's four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Wink. Three or four?

1497
05:43:47,680 --> 05:43:57,759
Is it three or four? Oh, we have some division here. It's three. It's three. I would have said

1498
05:43:57,759 --> 05:44:04,459
four. Is it four? Four. You idiots. Four. I'm gonna say four. I said four originally as well.

1499
05:44:05,180 --> 05:44:27,419
Yeah. No! It's all right. I passed it. Sorry, Jerm. We said three. Well,

1500
05:44:29,020 --> 05:44:50,560
other wheezes said four. Handrail training. Handrail training. Are you here to try handrail

1501
05:44:50,560 --> 05:45:01,500
training? Yes. This is going to teach you how to run fast so you can catch Tao.

1502
05:45:02,939 --> 05:45:06,139
Just run on top of the handrail and to the end of the course, then run back.

1503
05:45:07,340 --> 05:45:30,040
Free, Rangers, you're hard-boiled. Go, go, go. How's this? This just don't fall. Now run back.

1504
05:45:44,509 --> 05:45:54,939
Finish! Handrail training time. 31 seconds. You passed handrail training. So talented.

1505
05:45:55,740 --> 05:46:02,509
That's a lot of points though. Jungle training is next.

1506
05:46:13,630 --> 05:46:17,470
We're done with training for the day. I thought you wanted to do jungle training.

1507
05:46:22,270 --> 05:46:31,150
I'm almost out of time so I might as well clean up the puke.

1508
05:46:31,950 --> 05:46:42,509
Need more trash. There's a little bit of trash over here.

1509
05:46:43,790 --> 05:47:13,840
No, no, no. I want these. I want the scrap. I want that scrap. I thought an ad was playing.

1510
05:47:14,720 --> 05:47:23,709
All right, we're going to come back tomorrow and we're going to go upstairs.

1511
05:47:24,750 --> 05:47:33,229
Tomorrow is when we go upstairs. But I'm going to see if I can get in this demon door before

1512
05:47:33,229 --> 05:47:51,369
time runs out. How high is it? High enough? Let's hope so. I'll stop streaming yet. Oh no,

1513
05:47:51,369 --> 05:48:23,930
I'm talking about like tomorrow in the game. Another demon door up there too. I have enough

1514
05:48:23,930 --> 05:48:36,240
for the car now for sure. 29. Just don't die. All right, I think I can get it. I just have to

1515
05:48:36,240 --> 05:49:05,470
put it up a little higher. I'm going to run out of time I think. I'm going to say nope.

1516
05:49:06,110 --> 05:49:26,490
Better to be safe than dead. That's yes, that's true. Can't go up any higher.

1517
05:49:28,970 --> 05:49:55,709
Why not? It could go up so high. You saw how high we could just get this to go. Really?

1518
05:49:55,709 --> 05:50:13,599
Doesn't know. What do I not know? Cam's on? Oh, I can't get the other one over here.

1519
05:50:14,240 --> 05:50:17,439
Even if I push it down this way. This thing's not big enough.

1520
05:50:18,240 --> 05:50:33,580
But can I get to anywhere else? Oh, I can. Quick, get the snack. Get the can.

1521
05:50:34,860 --> 05:50:44,380
He is unaware of future events that may transpire, resulting in him having a negative

1522
05:50:44,380 --> 05:50:47,419
experience that would be humorous to his viewing audience. Pepe laugh.

1523
05:50:48,299 --> 05:51:12,970
Cam's off. I gotta be pretty high. 26. I would love to save. I would also love to see if I can

1524
05:51:12,970 --> 05:51:33,740
buy anything. What else you got in here? Kitchen ladder. Yep, yep, yep, buy it. We can finally get

1525
05:51:33,740 --> 05:51:55,759
the spoon. We can get the spoon to stir mom's drink. It's a utility bottle. All right, so buy

1526
05:51:55,759 --> 05:52:10,619
the car. We're looking for advice. Is morality objective or subjective? Thanks. I don't even

1527
05:52:10,619 --> 05:52:16,299
know what that means. That's too much for right now. I don't even, I don't, I don't even know.

1528
05:52:18,060 --> 05:52:49,799
Okay, I'm gonna get car. A popular car among racers. Buy. One full letter grade. I'm so excited.

1529
05:52:50,520 --> 05:52:56,970
I'm playing chibi-robo right now. I'm not going to question life's moralities. I'm cleaning as a

1530
05:52:56,970 --> 05:53:13,069
robot. All right, where's the car? Where's the car? How do I, where do I get it? Oh, all right.

1531
05:53:13,069 --> 05:53:31,930
All right, let's go. We're going upstairs. Wait, where's the trash? I want to throw this crap away.

1532
05:53:32,729 --> 05:53:37,360
I don't get to give it a full letter grade? That's kind of unfair. All right, we're going upstairs.

1533
05:53:41,020 --> 05:53:59,310
Please read this important haha nerd. Time that person up 10 minutes. Because, I mean, you're

1534
05:54:00,270 --> 05:54:09,209
gonna, hey, read this extremely important. No, come on. You're drunk. Why is he in the way?

1535
05:54:33,950 --> 05:54:40,090
But you are a nerd. Read this haha nerd. You're trying to get my attention with all caps. You're

1536
05:54:40,090 --> 05:54:46,830
gonna, I'm giving you 10 minutes. We've got, we've got to start to, we've got to start to quell.

1537
05:54:47,470 --> 05:55:31,159
Read this penis. That person 10 minutes too. Guys. All right, I'm going upstairs. People are crying

1538
05:55:31,159 --> 05:55:39,310
upstairs. So, I hope you guys are ready. By the way, Frog still has not received any water.

1539
05:55:40,110 --> 05:55:55,639
I want to make that clear. Okay, ban that person for 10 minutes. Okay. Ban that person for 5

1540
05:55:55,639 --> 05:56:17,310
minutes. I don't want to see them anymore. Yeah, get rid of that person. Oh, I need the thing.

1541
05:56:17,950 --> 05:56:31,919
Ban that person permanently. Because that's, oh yeah, I'm not going to look and fucking say

1542
05:56:31,919 --> 05:56:49,520
that to me. All right, I just gotta go up and then I can get over there. So, I need to be charged

1543
05:56:49,520 --> 05:57:16,319
first. You got him? All right, good. Permanent, right? Good. Thanks a lot. All right, let's go

1544
05:57:16,319 --> 05:57:43,150
upstairs. You can't stop me. You can't stop me. I am the stream. He did the funny voice. Hello.

1545
05:57:43,150 --> 05:58:01,869
Give him 15,000 upvotes. Wait, can I, can I even get over here? Am I even gonna,

1546
05:58:01,869 --> 05:58:18,840
can I even climb up this? This room is begging for upvotes. Please. Please. Wait, there's like

1547
05:58:18,840 --> 05:58:42,080
photos over there. Why is this guy gonna fight TF2? It is a TF2 waiting room. You mean TF2 like

1548
05:58:42,080 --> 05:58:56,439
purgatory room. You're not going anywhere. I'm gonna try to get it from here. All right,

1549
05:58:56,439 --> 05:59:18,159
what's up here? Pick a photo? Oh, look at how happy they are. Demon door. Rain world purgatory.

1550
05:59:18,159 --> 05:59:49,709
Rain world. Where's rain world? They got lost in the mill. Anything else over here? All right,

1551
05:59:49,709 --> 06:00:00,970
I'm gonna use the railing now. There's a lot of things that are in purgatory, I think, right?

1552
06:00:14,110 --> 06:00:36,959
Yeah, you. Imagine if this was purgatory. Imagine if we were in purgatory right now.

1553
06:00:36,959 --> 06:01:40,540
Fucked up. What if this is hell? On that railing. I went over it. Fuck. I mean, technically,

1554
06:01:40,540 --> 06:01:50,110
you can be in heaven or hell on earth while not being there mortally. Oh. Here we go. And here we

1555
06:01:50,110 --> 06:02:13,000
go. Here we go. Well, everything after every sentence I say go, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Right.

1556
06:02:13,000 --> 06:03:11,099
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Fucking railing. All right, I'm on. I'm car. I'm here. Car. Car. My car. My car.

1557
06:03:15,319 --> 06:03:32,270
Open the door. Give me my car. What? It's just a neutral. There's no gas. Sad human detected.

1558
06:03:32,270 --> 06:03:38,220
Sad human detected. All right, I'm coming over there with my car. We're gonna work this out.

1559
06:03:38,220 --> 06:04:00,110
Well, let me get the money first. Okay, well, let me plug in first. I need to have a full charge

1560
06:04:00,110 --> 06:04:18,000
for this. I'm going. I put. You want me to try to help somebody without. What if I run out of battery?

1561
06:04:18,000 --> 06:04:52,939
All right, I'm here. What's going on? Oh, hello, chibi. She's talking. You came all the way up here

1562
06:04:52,939 --> 06:05:09,150
because you heard Jenny crying, right? And he says thank you. The bear can talk.

1563
06:05:23,709 --> 06:05:28,029
Somebody said, oh my god, the bear can talk. Jenny says she's upset because mom and dad aren't

1564
06:05:28,029 --> 06:05:35,150
getting along. All right, this is getting heavy. All right, no more comedy. Mom won't let dad

1565
06:05:35,150 --> 06:05:43,740
sleep in their bedroom. I want to go into mom's room, but I can't move since I'm a stuffed animal.

1566
06:05:44,700 --> 06:05:54,759
All right, I'll get you in there. Just get in my car. What do you mean you did this? I did this?

1567
06:05:54,759 --> 06:06:00,200
What do you? This is no, this is like 30 years of trouble with marriage. I didn't do this. What do

1568
06:06:00,200 --> 06:06:14,459
you mean? I didn't do anything. They ordered me on Amazon like six days ago. I didn't do anything.

1569
06:06:14,459 --> 06:06:26,560
Mom walks the door at night, but she leaves the door open all day. All right, so we're gonna come

1570
06:06:26,560 --> 06:06:37,439
back during the day and go into mom's room. How am I gonna reach it? Give me my fucking car.

1571
06:06:43,150 --> 06:06:48,029
I can't. I want to just use the fucking car. Why? Why? I just want to drive around.

1572
06:06:50,459 --> 06:07:10,990
Come on. I just want to be like Stuart Little for once. Please. Fine. What else is over here?

1573
06:07:10,990 --> 06:07:35,049
I think I can get there from here. The demon door. Wait, shoot this. I mean, this is a confirmed

1574
06:07:35,049 --> 06:07:57,599
bed in the Metroid Prime mechanics. I gotta come back during the day. I have enough juice

1575
06:07:57,599 --> 06:08:18,459
for the demon door here. I don't know. I'm just getting some juice. Hold on. There's too much to

1576
06:08:18,459 --> 06:08:26,009
do. I'm going. I go back up there. Just hold on. I can go on. I know I look. I can get on the railing

1577
06:08:26,009 --> 06:08:48,959
right here. I just want to get the demon door. You saw what I was doing. I'm stomped up. You're

1578
06:08:48,959 --> 06:09:32,270
hurting his spine. Be all right. Energy wasted. We can go faster. Someone just said literally

1579
06:09:32,270 --> 06:09:40,270
fucking for IQ. What a fucking idiot. Stupid fucking moron. Relax, dude. And that guy forever.

1580
06:09:40,590 --> 06:10:09,400
Actually, I'm going to report him. You can walk off ledges with the chibi copter and float normally.

1581
06:10:09,400 --> 06:10:12,840
You don't always have to press to fly because you walk off a ledge to use it.

1582
06:10:13,560 --> 06:10:20,680
And then they say it's stupid fucking dumb idiot or IQ fucking moron. What the fuck?

1583
06:10:30,250 --> 06:10:51,000
All right, let's go in your room. I'm going in. It's open. The door is open.

1584
06:10:52,520 --> 06:10:58,840
Oh, I just picture you go, you tell your neck, you know, you mean, that's what I imagine.

1585
06:10:58,840 --> 06:11:06,279
This is what I imagine people were doing there. The door is open. You can go in. Oh, like you just

1586
06:11:06,279 --> 06:11:14,720
point your eyes and then you fucking scream three teeth. Oh, everybody. It's okay. I'm going to get

1587
06:11:14,720 --> 06:11:39,819
there. Lots of trash over here. Lots of trash in the kids room. Get it quick before time runs out.

1588
06:11:39,819 --> 06:11:53,799
Oh my god, there's so much trash. Get it all quick. Time's running out. That doesn't matter.

1589
06:11:53,799 --> 06:12:03,080
I can come back tomorrow. By the way, everybody has one of these under their bed,

1590
06:12:04,700 --> 06:12:09,580
especially where your head is, where your headboard is. So hard to get under here.

1591
06:12:21,150 --> 06:12:36,540
Um, Jenny, what are you keeping under here? Jenny, uh, thank god there was an alien in his chest that

1592
06:12:36,540 --> 06:12:51,439
killed him. And I scare you. Yeah, you did actually. I thought we were going to be in trouble.

1593
06:12:53,360 --> 06:13:04,810
Oh, you'll be nice. Everybody's got one of these under their bed.

1594
06:13:05,369 --> 06:13:13,849
I already have random wrappers, throat lozenges that you just find under here,

1595
06:13:13,849 --> 06:13:21,819
which by the way, those are still good. You know how many times I found vitamin C drops under here?

1596
06:13:21,819 --> 06:13:27,450
They're probably three years old. They're going to be fine. They have like a 30 year expiration day

1597
06:13:27,450 --> 06:13:43,439
and they're in a wrapper. That feels so good. All right. More trash.

1598
06:13:44,159 --> 06:13:59,790
True story. Uh, this is a real story. So Kim and I, uh, we did some cleaning and we found,

1599
06:14:00,509 --> 06:14:10,110
uh, we found a container under the bed of Ferrero Rochers. It was a sealed container.

1600
06:14:11,819 --> 06:14:22,299
It was covered in like dirt and dog hair and shit, but it was sealed in the box and we knew

1601
06:14:22,299 --> 06:14:26,939
they were probably like at least three to four months old, but they were still all right. They

1602
06:14:26,939 --> 06:14:33,479
were still within expiration. So we were going back and forth about like, is this shit? We can

1603
06:14:33,479 --> 06:14:37,560
eat these, right? I mean, they were under the bed and covered in dog hair, but they were sealed in

1604
06:14:37,560 --> 06:14:46,599
a container. That's okay. That's a great find. Now don't turn me off. Don't do that. That's not

1605
06:14:46,599 --> 06:14:51,549
that gross. That's not that gross. No, I don't, I don't want to turn the stream off. All right.

1606
06:14:51,549 --> 06:14:56,840
All right. Okay. All right. We'll see you tomorrow.

1607
06:15:01,840 --> 06:15:07,319
As long as it was, it was a sealed box. Yeah, but it was fine.

1608
06:15:13,360 --> 06:15:32,040
I'm number 14 in the world. What do you think? Is that a good place to stop for today?

1609
06:15:32,040 --> 06:15:35,479
I'm being realistic. Yeah. What? Like six and a half hours.

1610
06:15:36,360 --> 06:15:42,959
Let's do the rest tomorrow. I think that's a good place. We've got another probably six,

1611
06:15:42,959 --> 06:15:48,319
seven hours. I want to do this over two streams. This is like a 14 to 15 hour game, right? Like 12

1612
06:15:48,319 --> 06:16:03,159
to 14 hours. Is it another like full probably six, seven hours of this game? Roughly, roughly.

1613
06:16:03,159 --> 06:16:19,150
Okay. This is, this is two hours max. No, that's not 12 to 14 at the rate. Yeah. That's yeah.

1614
06:16:19,150 --> 06:16:23,229
Whatever. That's another like seven hours stream tomorrow. Six to eight hours stream tomorrow.

1615
06:16:23,229 --> 06:16:30,959
Yeah. Yeah. That when we have to just getting upstairs. I'm going to do it. I think this is

1616
06:16:30,959 --> 06:16:44,860
a good place to stop a little bit more. Oh, no, no, we'll stop. We'll stop. We'll stop. We'll stop

1617
06:16:44,860 --> 06:16:51,819
right now. Plus this is a good time that people, uh, you know, I started a little early. No, I did.

1618
06:16:51,819 --> 06:17:01,439
I started. Wait, let me, let me correct this for your warp. What does that do? Let's do it.

1619
06:17:02,080 --> 06:17:21,770
You're not halfway through the game. That's what I'm saying. The game's addictive. Yeah, it is.

1620
06:17:21,770 --> 06:17:25,069
I just want to leave enough time for there to be a full stream for this tomorrow.

1621
06:17:27,229 --> 06:17:30,509
And then after this, that's a really good question. What we're going to do after this.

1622
06:17:31,069 --> 06:17:46,669
There's a lot of stuff that I have back here, but yeah, I'm going to, we'll plug in, we'll save

1623
06:17:47,310 --> 06:17:50,750
and we'll, we'll pick it up after this tomorrow. We're still going to hang out for like 20,

1624
06:17:50,750 --> 06:17:53,549
30 minutes and do the bits. This is a good place to stop, I think.

1625
06:17:59,000 --> 06:18:12,700
So we'll see you tomorrow around 2 p.m. Pacific. See you then or chibi robo part two.

1626
06:18:18,889 --> 06:18:24,400
I am actually going to do something. I'm kind of freaking out about the memory card scenario

1627
06:18:24,400 --> 06:18:30,000
because I mean, this game's already safe and good. Well, I'm, uh, before I go to bed,

1628
06:18:30,000 --> 06:18:34,479
I'm going to turn this on and turn the we often turn it back on and hope that the thing's not

1629
06:18:34,479 --> 06:18:41,790
corrupt. You know, that's like, that's for scaring me. I don't know why it is. It shouldn't happen

1630
06:18:41,790 --> 06:18:47,849
though, but, uh, we'll end it here. Probably see you guys maybe tomorrow starting around that,

1631
06:18:47,849 --> 06:18:52,330
like 1 30 to 2 p.m. Pacific. I just said that, but I'm repeating myself. It's okay.

1632
06:18:56,029 --> 06:19:08,680
See you tomorrow. Thanks for watching part two tomorrow. It's corrupted. God leave the we on.

1633
06:19:08,680 --> 06:19:12,759
No, I'm sure it'll be fine. Yeah. If this if it's been working this much, it's it would be fine.

1634
06:19:13,479 --> 06:19:25,279
Let's go back to earlier today. Take care of everybody. If you leave them. We had 250 from

1635
06:19:25,279 --> 06:19:32,959
gnarly earlier and they say, do you really think you can climb the league ladder playing troll

1636
06:19:32,959 --> 06:19:38,880
shit like twisted fate jungle? Oh my God. Jeremy, you have to do well with me. I play top. My scion

1637
06:19:39,599 --> 06:19:46,479
is clean as fuck, but I also play jacks and gnar. If you want to jungle play around top with someone

1638
06:19:46,479 --> 06:19:56,299
like Zach, he's even real league. These league champions. I'll carry you to gold. I feel like

1639
06:19:56,299 --> 06:20:04,520
you're just making up names. I don't play league. Don't listen to any person that tells you I play

1640
06:20:04,520 --> 06:20:09,880
league. Grandpa played league once and it's one of the worst videos I've ever made. It's still up

1641
06:20:09,880 --> 06:20:15,389
and it's still there. You can watch it if you want right now and see. Thanks for the 500 bits.

1642
06:20:16,330 --> 06:20:23,900
Is this the first strand type game? Maybe I'm not going to watch it on stream,

1643
06:20:26,840 --> 06:20:33,680
delete it on stream. No. Belsix. Thanks for the 500 bits. Belsix. I came home from college this

1644
06:20:33,680 --> 06:20:38,240
weekend to visit family and introduced my sister to your streams. My parents saw and they told me

1645
06:20:38,240 --> 06:20:46,830
there is something wrong with you. That's telling them. Just you got to say, you got to introduce

1646
06:20:46,830 --> 06:20:51,229
me as like a comedian. You know what I mean? Like, oh, there's this comedian. He has this show.

1647
06:20:51,869 --> 06:20:57,400
And then they'll be like, oh, okay. I get it. I get it. I see. It's just a show. He's a comedian.

1648
06:20:58,040 --> 06:21:04,400
And then that's, he does, everything's fine. I hope you're not introducing me as a doctor or

1649
06:21:04,400 --> 06:21:09,689
something. Hey, I watched this doctor on stream. Oh, he's a doctor? Oh, he sounds like a fucking

1650
06:21:09,689 --> 06:21:21,770
idiot to me. Always introduce me as an e-clown or as a comedian. Fire 25 shadow. Thanks for the 500

1651
06:21:21,770 --> 06:21:27,080
bits. Five dollars. Thanks for the fantastic streams. You brighten up my day. Looking forward

1652
06:21:27,080 --> 06:21:33,979
to the rest of the year. The more hilarious content. See? I'm not a doctor. Also, you missed my

1653
06:21:33,979 --> 06:21:52,439
wink when Drake Redkiss first appeared. Missing fucking winks. I think that was a lie, but

1654
06:21:52,439 --> 06:22:04,860
whatever. Anyways, thank you for the 500 bits. German lied about the frog coin. Thanks to the

1655
06:22:04,860 --> 06:22:09,180
five community subs. This, I'm telling you, why can't you even have a name that long?

1656
06:22:09,979 --> 06:22:19,080
Why is your name not like striker two or something? I don't know. Why is it Jerma lied about the frog

1657
06:22:19,080 --> 06:22:34,380
coin? Why is your name not something just like, they'll get them. Six, seven, eight. Thanks though

1658
06:22:34,380 --> 06:22:38,459
for the five community subs. Breanne Ben, thanks for the five dollars and 10 cents. Do you think

1659
06:22:38,459 --> 06:22:43,900
Jerma is more compact than chibi robo? Considering I am at least as tall as a fucking chair.

1660
06:22:44,459 --> 06:22:52,810
Um, no. Yes, I am. Yes, I am. I mean, yes. Get out of here. Thanks for the five dollars. Hey,

1661
06:22:52,810 --> 06:23:03,709
wingman. Thanks for the 500. Five community subs. Thank you, wingman. God damn it. Uh,

1662
06:23:04,750 --> 06:23:10,619
Jen or Gen Pendulum, thanks for the 300 bits, is another bit dream. I once dreamed that you

1663
06:23:10,619 --> 06:23:15,099
were streaming puppeteering with a Yoda puppet and at one point you forgot his name.

1664
06:23:15,819 --> 06:23:28,889
It's pretty funny. Swoosh. Thanks for the 500 bits. Today's my parent's birthday and we both

1665
06:23:28,889 --> 06:23:35,880
love your streams. All right. Can you wish Marty a happy birthday from me? It'll make their night.

1666
06:23:35,880 --> 06:23:51,159
Happy birthday, Marty. Happy birthday, Marty. Hope you have a good one. Take care. Thanks a lot,

1667
06:23:51,159 --> 06:24:02,889
guys. Hope you enjoy it. It is birthday, man. Yeah. We also had 500 bits, five dollars from

1668
06:24:02,970 --> 06:24:10,840
Yucatare. They say, thanks for doing my sale of requests yesterday. Congratulations on 10 million

1669
06:24:10,840 --> 06:24:15,080
views. An amazing amount for an amazing streamer and content creator. Look at me. Thank you.

1670
06:24:16,029 --> 06:24:20,909
PS item filter as in something that makes a custom sound when an item drops in game. Oh, okay.

1671
06:24:21,790 --> 06:24:32,490
I get it. That makes sense. It'd be a thing. Uh, Jerma's average dong gave 30 community subs over

1672
06:24:32,490 --> 06:24:41,479
the course of the night. So thanks for the 30 subs dong. The username. That's a username that

1673
06:24:41,479 --> 06:24:52,040
you have spent money on a lot of money with average misspelled. He's wonderful. Wonderful.

1674
06:24:52,040 --> 06:25:03,209
Where's where the fuck is striker too? Stripes beast. Thanks for the 500 bits. Thank you again

1675
06:25:03,209 --> 06:25:09,049
for playing this game after watching you cut burn and crush an Asian mother's hand yesterday.

1676
06:25:09,049 --> 06:25:15,150
I'm relieved that you are playing a game about family strife. I'm doing a big road trip soon.

1677
06:25:15,150 --> 06:25:19,549
I'm heading through Vegas. Any spots a poor man would like. Love you in the community.

1678
06:25:22,330 --> 06:25:32,240
Thank you. He called the message one more time.

1679
06:25:36,439 --> 06:25:48,169
Message needed to code. You got it. That's where I think you should go.

1680
06:25:51,360 --> 06:26:06,349
Best restaurant in Vegas. You're a peanuts adult. Red rock is a bit outside town. It's amazing.

1681
06:26:06,349 --> 06:26:15,279
Hiking, walking. That's also true. Red rock Canyon is beautiful. Highly recommend. I have seen it.

1682
06:26:15,919 --> 06:26:25,500
Those are Mount Charleston. They have lodges up there, but that's not really going through Vegas.

1683
06:26:26,619 --> 06:26:32,479
Mount Charleston is like a ski resort, but it is really nice.

1684
06:26:36,110 --> 06:26:46,889
Say hi to my parents. If you see them, they're going to Vegas on Sunday. I will. What are you

1685
06:26:46,889 --> 06:26:53,770
doing? Why? I don't, I don't watch links anymore. Half the time it's, it's fucking Rick roll.

1686
06:27:06,720 --> 06:27:14,759
Hi, what do you got? What is this? Be careful what you wish for a German. I'm curious. What is this?

1687
06:27:14,759 --> 06:27:34,779
I actually really want to know about the music. Hey, what is it around?

1688
06:27:37,180 --> 06:27:42,380
Come on. I just want to feel like Stuart little for once. Please, please, please.

1689
06:27:50,459 --> 06:28:16,759
I don't, I don't actual size. Okay. What do you make this shit? So all right, let's go.

1690
06:28:17,639 --> 06:28:37,549
Hey, there it is. That person said their partner, Marty, not their parents. What?

1691
06:28:38,430 --> 06:28:59,290
Today is my parents' birthday. Let's go back and do that one again. That was swoosh swoosh. Today is

1692
06:28:59,290 --> 06:29:03,849
my partner's birthday. And we both love your stream. Can you give Marty a happy birthday? Happy

1693
06:29:03,849 --> 06:29:11,500
birthday, Marty. Not somebody's parents. You're somebody's partner. I read it wrong. Thank you,

1694
06:29:11,900 --> 06:29:25,040
sorry about the mix up. Yeah, I was right. It's like my parents birthday. We both love your stream.

1695
06:29:26,000 --> 06:29:29,759
For a second I'm like, wait, are you both, are you one of the parents? And I'm like, what the

1696
06:29:29,759 --> 06:29:44,220
fuck am I talking about? Does that sound weird? Yeah, I was wrong. I'm an idiot. It's okay.

1697
06:29:46,810 --> 06:30:00,400
All right, let's keep going. We had, I don't know. Where are we? Right here. We had Jay

1698
06:30:01,360 --> 06:30:09,340
Hawn, Jay Hawnizzle. Thanks for the thousand bits. 10 bucks. Hey, Jeremy, today's my 20th birthday.

1699
06:30:09,900 --> 06:30:17,159
Happy birthday. I'm glad this game was postponed today and I'm sorry about the memory card.

1700
06:30:17,159 --> 06:30:26,759
It's all right. I'm glad that I didn't try to continue to play yesterday. I'm glad we

1701
06:30:26,759 --> 06:30:31,659
pivoted to Cooking Mama. That was also a very fun time for me. So we're good. Thanks for the

1702
06:30:31,659 --> 06:30:36,139
last of the years and I look forward to any big future projects you have planned. Also, please

1703
06:30:36,220 --> 06:30:44,779
show feed on stream. Thank you. Uh, no, I don't think I'm going to do that. Thanks for the 10

1704
06:30:44,779 --> 06:30:51,680
bucks. Appreciate it. Erotic Frankfurt. Thanks for the 300 bits. Hello from Australia. Please

1705
06:30:51,680 --> 06:31:03,040
say g'day mate. G'day mate. Hello from America, specifically Las Vegas. He did the super frog

1706
06:31:03,040 --> 06:31:10,250
voice. Now I'm going to be conscious of that. Potato Chief. Thanks for the thousand bits.

1707
06:31:10,250 --> 06:31:12,569
Great impression of someone being attacked by bees.

1708
06:31:19,099 --> 06:31:27,229
Oh, I want to see that clip. Somebody give me the clip of the Tasmanian Devil. I want to hear it.

1709
06:31:27,229 --> 06:31:33,799
I want to see how close it was. Does anybody have it? Also, can't wait for you guys to,

1710
06:31:34,520 --> 06:31:39,880
every time we get raided, to have a perfect clip of this. But when anytime somebody raids

1711
06:31:39,880 --> 06:31:43,479
us or a new community comes in to say hello, can't wait for this to be with your shoulders.

1712
06:31:43,479 --> 06:32:07,630
Actually, not that bad. That's actually, it was a little too high though. I think it was too high.

1713
06:32:16,330 --> 06:32:21,630
No, I'm not trying again. No, I can't go all in right now. It'll be embarrassing.

1714
06:32:24,060 --> 06:32:32,639
Hey, I've been attacked by bees. Apple Shift. Thanks for the 250. Yo, you planning on doing

1715
06:32:32,639 --> 06:32:40,779
any conventions this year? Not this year. No, not until probably TwitchCon. I think I'm only

1716
06:32:40,779 --> 06:32:49,389
going to TwitchCon. I have no plans on going to E3. I have no plans on going anywhere in the

1717
06:32:49,389 --> 06:32:58,200
immediate future. Any packs. TwitchCon's the next thing that's in the radar here. DexCon delayed.

1718
06:33:05,610 --> 06:33:10,840
Yeah, now it'll be embarrassing. We already talked about this if you weren't here before.

1719
06:33:12,459 --> 06:33:18,380
If you do a Tasmanian Devil impression, if you don't go fucking as hard as you possibly can,

1720
06:33:18,380 --> 06:33:24,169
it's going to be embarrassing. It's zero and a hundred. If you don't go to a hundred,

1721
06:33:24,970 --> 06:33:29,450
it's going to be like, whoa, that was horrible and embarrassing. I'm embarrassed for you.

1722
06:33:29,450 --> 06:33:41,500
Trust me. I know. It was still embarrassing. Not for me. Hey, Sir Canine. Thanks for the 250.

1723
06:33:41,500 --> 06:33:46,860
My face when Jerma makes the short jokes himself by celebrating that he can reach high things when

1724
06:33:46,860 --> 06:33:53,340
he gets a ladder. Feels bad, man. It's Chibi-Robo. You're as big as eight thimbles stacked on top

1725
06:33:53,340 --> 06:34:00,349
of each other. Of course I'm going to be making references about being smaller. Sir Canine, thanks

1726
06:34:00,349 --> 06:34:05,389
for the 250. Local Chibi streamer loses it over a Chibi children's game while drinking Chibi Cola

1727
06:34:05,389 --> 06:34:14,000
and giving out free Chibi Winx. Thanks. Styx Renegade, thanks for the 250. Hey, Jerma,

1728
06:34:14,000 --> 06:34:19,610
haven't cheered in a while. Trying to save cash for some incoming car troubles in a furry convention.

1729
06:34:19,610 --> 06:34:23,790
All right. Turns out the car trouble wasn't as bad, so I'm passing a few of my savings on to you.

1730
06:34:24,430 --> 06:34:31,259
Also, three fucking years I've been subbed. It's a long ass time. What's that three-year sub badge?

1731
06:34:31,259 --> 06:34:36,560
Where's the three-year sub badge? Yeah, I know. Also, Crash Team Racing, Nitro-Fueled,

1732
06:34:36,560 --> 06:34:41,439
and Burger King Xbox 360 games. When are you going to play them? Also, Draw My Fursona.

1733
06:34:43,520 --> 06:34:52,009
I'm busy, but I'll probably get this Burger King games. I'll do them all in like 20 minutes or

1734
06:34:52,009 --> 06:35:08,509
something. You could probably beat all those games in an hour or so. Yeah, I've got Xbox games,

1735
06:35:08,509 --> 06:35:14,909
360 games. They're all good, too. Here's what happened. As you all know, we've done a lot of

1736
06:35:14,909 --> 06:35:22,490
PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, random Xbox games. We've played a lot of shitty, terrible, crap old

1737
06:35:22,490 --> 06:35:28,729
games, and the only ones that are left are the good ones. There are a bunch of games over here

1738
06:35:28,729 --> 06:35:37,549
that are all the good ones that are just here. There's at least probably 20 games over here that

1739
06:35:37,549 --> 06:35:46,349
are all worth playing completely all the way through. So, we got a long way. I bet I could

1740
06:35:46,349 --> 06:35:53,200
find some more trash. Oh, don't worry. There's too much trash on these consoles that it'll be

1741
06:35:53,200 --> 06:36:00,799
impossible to not ever do that again. What are some of them? Well, I don't want to give away spoilers.

1742
06:36:01,680 --> 06:36:10,040
Just speaking GameCube. I mean, Mario Sunshine, Eternal Darkness, both beautiful Joes.

1743
06:36:11,000 --> 06:36:21,360
I don't even want to go further than that. I don't want to go for Gotcha Force, which is one of the

1744
06:36:21,360 --> 06:36:27,360
best GameCube games ever. They're so good. They're going to be all done to their completion.

1745
06:36:28,080 --> 06:36:44,080
Kirby's Air Ride. I don't have it. Maybe I'll get it. Anyways, we're almost done with the bits here.

1746
06:36:44,080 --> 06:36:50,029
We have about five or six more to do. Tar Alecran, thanks for the 250. Jeremy, I want to thank you

1747
06:36:50,029 --> 06:36:54,909
for being so accommodating to those with those busy schedules who can't catch the whole stream.

1748
06:36:54,909 --> 06:37:00,110
If you didn't reuse the same joke three times, we might miss some content. All right. I'm just

1749
06:37:00,110 --> 06:37:08,119
I'm looking out for you. I'm looking out for you. Don't you guys ever watch the news? If you ever

1750
06:37:08,119 --> 06:37:13,209
watch the news, the news is on like, for instance, some networks that are 24-hour news networks.

1751
06:37:13,209 --> 06:37:19,849
And it's just it's the same two-hour broadcast for 24 hours. You know, I've got a cycle in the new

1752
06:37:19,849 --> 06:37:30,400
people that are coming in. They got to know what's going on today. And it's all fake.

1753
06:37:34,459 --> 06:37:47,470
Play Ill Bleed. I actually tried to track a copy of Ill Bleed down for the Dreamcast. Did I play

1754
06:37:47,470 --> 06:38:02,270
that? Did I get one? No, that's a different game. Sir Canine, thanks for the 250. FocalStreamer

1755
06:38:02,270 --> 06:38:07,470
lists games he has promised to keep playing to chat with literally no intention of ever playing

1756
06:38:07,470 --> 06:38:17,259
them again. This dude is fricked. James O'Byrne, thanks for the 300 bits. Doc 3660, thanks for the

1757
06:38:17,259 --> 06:38:23,529
250. My mom just asked why her 22-year-old son is watching a 35-year-old play a 15-year-old game

1758
06:38:23,529 --> 06:38:28,169
meant for seven-year-olds on a 19-year-old console for over six hours in 2020 when he should be

1759
06:38:28,169 --> 06:38:32,569
studying six hours for his arts degree so he can work eight hours a day at a Burger King for 30

1760
06:38:32,569 --> 06:38:54,299
years until he dies. Damn. Holy shit. That was fucking crazy. You're laughing? Yeah, because

1761
06:38:54,299 --> 06:39:01,900
that was a crafted comment. That was a carefully crafted, like, okay, I opened up the jar at the

1762
06:39:01,900 --> 06:39:09,180
candle store and smelled the fresh clean vanilla laundry one. You know what I mean? Like,

1763
06:39:09,180 --> 06:39:17,599
ooh, put the cover back on. That was like fucking, that was worth sniffing. It was crafted.

1764
06:39:18,240 --> 06:39:33,439
Thank you, Doc. The 250. I'm gonna keep that one. I might buy that one. I might, you know,

1765
06:39:34,240 --> 06:39:41,290
I might buy that candle and smell it once on the ride home in the passenger seat while somebody's

1766
06:39:41,290 --> 06:39:47,560
driving. Just like, oh, yeah, that's the right way to use this. And I don't ever light it once. The

1767
06:39:47,560 --> 06:39:56,459
candle has never used. In fact, six months go by and I don't even know where it is. And no one

1768
06:39:56,459 --> 06:40:05,500
knows where it is. Four years go by, moving out of the house. You find it in a closet and you go,

1769
06:40:05,979 --> 06:40:15,840
whoa, holy shit. Yeah, I remember we got this. Oh, it smells good. Pack that. You pack it up.

1770
06:40:15,840 --> 06:40:20,810
Goes into a box. Six more months go by. It's still in the box that you moved with.

1771
06:40:21,369 --> 06:40:46,330
And the cycle repeats until you die. Put that on a shirt. Pass it to your career. No music. Oh,

1772
06:40:46,330 --> 06:40:56,520
what the monk. Hey, whatever it is. Hey, thanks, Doc. That was a great comment. Smelly boy. Thanks

1773
06:40:56,520 --> 06:41:02,599
for the 250, smelly boy. Picking up on the Alfredo talk from yesterday. I contend that

1774
06:41:02,599 --> 06:41:09,400
spaghetti noodles outperform fettuccine as Alfredo noodles. They're easier to come across and easier

1775
06:41:09,400 --> 06:41:15,950
to eat with a spoon and fork. Also, do you prefer the chicken in your Alfredo noodles breaded or

1776
06:41:15,950 --> 06:41:25,900
bare breaded? Breaded thinly sliced. Fettuccine soaks up more of, fettuccine soaks up way more of

1777
06:41:25,900 --> 06:41:31,599
the sauce and juices. You get way more sauce per bite. The spaghetti falls right off the bone

1778
06:41:31,599 --> 06:41:39,389
on the spaghetti. You know what I mean? Breaded. Yeah, breaded. Oh, yeah. Just thinly breaded.

1779
06:41:39,389 --> 06:41:43,470
Thinly breaded. I'm not talking about like fried chicken. I'm talking thin,

1780
06:41:43,470 --> 06:41:55,450
little bit flour, just thinly crisp. Thinly crisp. That's it. Thin. Tar Alecran, thanks for

1781
06:41:55,450 --> 06:41:59,689
the 250. Jerma, when are you gonna play some Shenmue? I remember asking ages ago when you

1782
06:41:59,689 --> 06:42:04,330
were playing Dreamcast games and you assured me that it would be soon. And here I am paying

1783
06:42:04,330 --> 06:42:13,770
another $2.50 for my hard-earned dough to call you out to fulfill your oath. I own them. I bought

1784
06:42:13,770 --> 06:42:19,209
them on PC. The reason why I didn't play them is because they were coming out. They hadn't come out

1785
06:42:19,209 --> 06:42:24,650
on PC yet, right? Or at least what, two didn't? They remade them or something? Like three was coming

1786
06:42:24,650 --> 06:42:27,689
out. So I was like, no, you know, I'm just gonna wait till three comes out and then I'll do them

1787
06:42:27,689 --> 06:42:32,650
all. And then they took a long time. And then it came out and then three wasn't very good,

1788
06:42:33,130 --> 06:42:39,959
from what I hear. And then I was like, wait, oh, shit, this is not very good.

1789
06:42:39,959 --> 06:42:48,680
Well, and then I remember, wait, two and one aren't even very good. They're like 180-hour long games.

1790
06:42:48,680 --> 06:42:56,669
And I was like, wait, fuck. But they are. I remember playing Shenmue 1 and had fun.

1791
06:42:57,310 --> 06:43:08,200
Like, you drive around in a forklift for 12 hours. Yeah, wait, do I want to play that? Maybe. Maybe.

1792
06:43:08,200 --> 06:43:12,759
That was fun. It was fun. Joel's playing it right now. Well, you're gonna go say hello to him and

1793
06:43:12,759 --> 06:43:23,709
tell him that I said it was 180. He's Joel playing it right now. Stream Joel's... Okay. Okay. Just

1794
06:43:23,709 --> 06:43:28,750
pretend I'm streaming when you watch Joel's stream. We're both doing it at the same time.

1795
06:43:30,060 --> 06:43:39,279
My spirit is there in that forklift. Anyways. PeacefulHaleigh gave 5,000 bits. We had $50 from

1796
06:43:39,279 --> 06:43:52,139
Haleigh. Holy shit, Haleigh. More huge, insane money drops. Pog. Thank you, Haleigh. Jeremy.

1797
06:43:52,939 --> 06:43:57,229
Just kind of felt like showing my love. Have a good night. That means a lot. Thank you. That's

1798
06:43:57,229 --> 06:44:05,529
a lot of money. Hopefully I use it well. Thank you, Haleigh. Enable Pog. No. It is enabled already.

1799
06:44:05,529 --> 06:44:12,459
Pog is enabled because I want to read it. PogChamp is different. Pog, I want to be able to read it.

1800
06:44:14,319 --> 06:44:23,069
It's a different meaning for me when I read it. Show Joel sneeze. Sneeze on Joel. What? How

1801
06:44:23,069 --> 06:44:32,439
would I do that? But thanks a lot, Haleigh. That's a ton of money. And right after that,

1802
06:44:32,439 --> 06:44:42,279
MechaMurf gave 1,500 bits. Thank you, MechaMurf. It'll be $15. You gave a shitload of money last

1803
06:44:42,279 --> 06:44:47,880
night, so thank you. Back on top. Love supporting you, Jeremy. I've been watching since 2014. It's

1804
06:44:47,880 --> 06:44:52,279
not a contest, but I appreciate it nonetheless. Thank you. Thanks for sticking around for so long.

1805
06:44:54,009 --> 06:45:01,740
We got Stryker2. 300 bits from Stryker2. What's going on? Good to see you again. Hey, Jeremy.

1806
06:45:01,740 --> 06:45:07,439
Thanks for the recognition for once. I'm donating to say that Stryker Underscore2 is a fake and not

1807
06:45:07,439 --> 06:45:17,119
me. Love watching the streams. Keep up the amazing content. I'll keep that in mind. Thanks a lot.

1808
06:45:17,119 --> 06:45:22,959
Hey, Bitslave. Thanks for the 250. Hey, Jermo. I was watching your VOD on Diablo 2 and I stopped

1809
06:45:22,959 --> 06:45:35,529
watching because it sucked. Okay. Now, what else? Just kidding. I bought it and wanted to play it

1810
06:45:35,529 --> 06:45:38,970
with no spoilers. I've never played Diablo before and I'm excited. It's one of the best

1811
06:45:38,970 --> 06:45:50,830
games ever made, so I wish you the best of luck. Actually, one of the best games ever made. It

1812
06:45:50,830 --> 06:46:00,939
really is. Truly. You're going to love it. Thanks for the 250. The Dreamcast sucks. No, no, no. You

1813
06:46:00,939 --> 06:46:27,709
got it wrong. The Dreamcast fucking sucks. Just the culmination. That was like the 10th Dreamcast

1814
06:46:27,709 --> 06:46:35,950
game. That person didn't have like no sub badge. It was just no nothing. It was just a name that

1815
06:46:35,950 --> 06:46:42,830
just said like just fine in a Dreamcast stream. Dude, this console sucks. Everything about it

1816
06:46:42,830 --> 06:46:51,150
makes me happy. Everything about it makes me laugh. It's a perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect

1817
06:46:51,150 --> 06:46:58,959
piece of humor. Oh, it's perfect. Those games are all so bad. I know. And that's why it's

1818
06:46:59,919 --> 06:47:10,319
the one guy moment of the decade. It's just because I knew. You know what I mean? Like those

1819
06:47:10,319 --> 06:47:14,720
Dreamcast streams, some of them were really fun, but there was one in particular that was at least

1820
06:47:14,720 --> 06:47:20,650
three or four games in a row that were horrendous and they weren't funny. They weren't even fun.

1821
06:47:21,209 --> 06:47:27,819
And it just sucked. And I knew it. And like three or four hours go by and that's the

1822
06:47:27,819 --> 06:47:32,619
message I look over and it's like fuck the Dreamcast. That's your only view of the Dreamcast.

1823
06:47:32,619 --> 06:47:39,500
Dreamcast sucks, man. Well, this is what it has. This guy's streaming this shit. This guy's

1824
06:47:39,500 --> 06:47:44,220
streaming these games. It's got to be worth playing. And so no, these games, this console's

1825
06:47:44,220 --> 06:47:57,790
terrible. Oh, I love every second of it. Anyways, I could gush about it forever. Anyways, uh,

1826
06:47:57,790 --> 06:48:06,299
Jobbed Bone, thanks to the 250. Jerma, how do I tell my mom I love her? Go up to your mother and

1827
06:48:07,180 --> 06:48:11,680
first of all, before you do this, um, take, maybe take care of a few things around the house.

1828
06:48:12,479 --> 06:48:20,509
Find out what your mother's got going on tomorrow. Does she have some errands that she needs to run?

1829
06:48:20,509 --> 06:48:26,970
Do them. Oh, ma, I just want to let you know, but before I, uh, something came in for the mail,

1830
06:48:27,770 --> 06:48:33,290
I took care of it. I took the mail in. I, um, cleaned the windows and shit. I, there was, uh,

1831
06:48:33,290 --> 06:48:40,349
you had an appointment. I got, I wrote it in the calendar off over here. Find out what your

1832
06:48:40,349 --> 06:48:46,619
mother's up to. Make her life easier for the next couple of days. You don't have to say anything.

1833
06:48:55,840 --> 06:49:39,389
Reread the message. Jerma, how do I tell my mom I love, love her? Okay. I'm trying to give

1834
06:49:39,389 --> 06:49:49,500
advice. Don't ever give advice ever again. Bitslave, thanks for the 250. Please play

1835
06:49:49,500 --> 06:49:53,979
Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg and Kirby Air Ride. It's a great game. If you don't believe me,

1836
06:49:54,619 --> 06:50:09,020
fuck me, I guess. Okay. Check out my OC. What the fuck are you doing? Check out my OC.

1837
06:50:09,659 --> 06:50:23,279
What is, what's going on? Okay. Here, we'll check it out. Sure. Cool. Thanks for the,

1838
06:50:23,279 --> 06:50:37,130
thanks for the OC. Yeah, Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg is on the list. Hey, Jake Lemons.

1839
06:50:38,189 --> 06:50:52,380
Thank you, Jake Lemons. 1337 for the 500 bits. Do you think, Murph, that Arabian Prince Donator

1840
06:50:52,380 --> 06:51:02,569
would play League with me? What the fuck are you talking about? Peaceful Haley, thanks for the

1841
06:51:02,569 --> 06:51:13,049
$10. And here's some more money so I can get my 25,000 badge. God damn. Thank you.

1842
06:51:13,049 --> 06:51:21,319
Thank you. Thanks for the thousand bits, Haley. On top of the fucking huge money

1843
06:51:21,319 --> 06:51:29,200
drop from earlier. Thank you. Sasha Green, Spider Queen, thanks for the 250. Jeremy,

1844
06:51:29,200 --> 06:51:35,580
what animal would your fursona be and what color would it be? I see slash S. Is that supposed to

1845
06:51:35,580 --> 06:51:43,020
be like sarcastic, right? It was a frog. Frog. Yeah, I'm a frog. Frog. Done. I already did it.

1846
06:51:43,020 --> 06:51:49,520
A frog. A rat. I don't know. Who cares? Mecha Murph, thanks for the 1500 bits. I can't stop.

1847
06:51:49,520 --> 06:51:58,540
I won't stop. Can't stop. Won't stop. Mecha Murph, another $15. Thank you, Murph. Appreciate it.

1848
06:52:00,250 --> 06:52:08,040
Beautiful Jen, thank you for the 250 times two, which is $5. Jeremy, any plans to do anything from

1849
06:52:08,040 --> 06:52:12,360
Pikmin? It'd be a real treat to watch you play one of them. Also, congrats on 10 million views.

1850
06:52:12,360 --> 06:52:17,849
You deserve them all. Thanks for all the laughs. Yes, there is. The thing about Pikmin, I'm going

1851
06:52:17,849 --> 06:52:25,150
to need some help on this one. I don't think I would play all the Pikmins. Pikmin as a series,

1852
06:52:25,150 --> 06:52:35,209
to me, is Pikmin one versus Pikmin two versus Pikmin three. I feel like two is just kind of a

1853
06:52:35,209 --> 06:52:41,659
more engrossed version of one, a more expanded version of one. Right? Does that make sense?

1854
06:52:42,299 --> 06:52:51,930
Am I crazy? You guys have to help me here. Two is the one to play. Play two. So if I just played two,

1855
06:52:52,729 --> 06:53:02,970
then I would get good. That'd be fine, right? I don't know about three. Two is way better than

1856
06:53:02,970 --> 06:53:11,759
one and three is okay. Okay. Only the second and the third, right? Three is harder for your small

1857
06:53:11,759 --> 06:53:18,029
brain. It doesn't matter how small your brain is. It's about how many fucking neurons are in there,

1858
06:53:18,029 --> 06:53:25,159
though. And I got a lot, so please. But yeah, definitely. Pikmin two will be probably the one

1859
06:53:25,159 --> 06:53:30,479
I play. Kar Alekran, thanks for the 250. Jeremy, with all the utter nonsense you play, you are

1860
06:53:30,479 --> 06:53:34,880
seriously turning your nose up at Shenmue, one of the most famous and storied and beloved franchises,

1861
06:53:34,880 --> 06:53:44,459
really. Those games you're describing are not 150 hours long. There's a difference between

1862
06:53:45,419 --> 06:53:52,439
cooking mama for four hours and playing Shenmue one through three for 400 on stream hours.

1863
06:53:57,389 --> 06:54:35,549
I think there's a big difference. They're not that long. How long are they? Like 50 hours. Sorry. It

1864
06:54:35,549 --> 06:54:53,979
would take a full month. No, look, I've said this before a million times. I will never completely

1865
06:54:53,979 --> 06:54:57,419
tell you that I'm never going to play something because I have no idea what's going to happen in

1866
06:54:57,419 --> 06:55:02,220
the future. A couple months might go by and I'll be like, fuck it, man. Let's play Shenmue. Let's go.

1867
06:55:02,220 --> 06:55:11,520
I don't have a plan. My plans on this stream are only, only the big projects that take

1868
06:55:12,240 --> 06:55:17,040
a few months to put together. There are no fucking plans on this stream besides those.

1869
06:55:17,040 --> 06:55:26,619
Zero. I don't have a game that I play any time of day. I just, each week, each month, I'll sit down

1870
06:55:26,619 --> 06:55:29,900
and be like, what do I feel like doing this week? What do I feel like doing in the next couple months?

1871
06:55:30,779 --> 06:55:36,270
It's this. I can never tell you that I'm never going to play something

1872
06:55:36,270 --> 06:55:43,119
because who knows? It could happen tomorrow. Is community content night this Saturday? Uh oh,

1873
06:55:43,119 --> 06:55:50,040
wait. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. Yo. Okay. Hold on. I may have screwed up here.

1874
06:55:53,119 --> 06:55:57,439
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. Friday would be four. Well,

1875
06:55:59,639 --> 06:56:15,360
uh-huh. Community content night is going to be moved. Not far, not far. Only a couple days.

1876
06:56:15,360 --> 06:56:21,500
Only a couple days. Only a couple days. Would you rather me, would you rather have community content

1877
06:56:21,500 --> 06:56:29,369
on a Tuesday or on a Saturday or Sunday? Which one? What would you prefer?

1878
06:56:30,009 --> 06:56:38,139
Tuesday or a Saturday or Sunday? Which one? Which one? Sunday? Weekend? Sunday? Like I said,

1879
06:56:38,139 --> 06:56:47,450
on a Sunday? Okay. All right. The real date for the next community content night, and I, this is,

1880
06:56:47,450 --> 06:56:54,669
I screwed up some planning here. It's because I had to, I had some shit to do. The real date

1881
06:56:54,669 --> 06:57:03,720
for the community content night will not be March 1st. It's going to be March 8th. Sunday, March 8th.

1882
06:57:04,439 --> 06:57:13,119
We're going to have a lot to go through. I never plan. There you are. There you go. In motion.

1883
06:57:13,919 --> 06:57:23,150
In motion, you're seeing these things. Thank you, King. Why are people doing that now?

1884
06:57:23,790 --> 06:57:29,310
I've seen that a lot. Hey, what's, when's this happening, King? Oh, that was so good, King.

1885
06:57:29,310 --> 06:57:33,799
Well, I've seen that a lot. Is that like a thing people are doing now for fun? I keep seeing it.

1886
06:57:34,520 --> 06:57:41,549
Anyways, yeah, it's not going to lie because we're doing like four or five days in a row,

1887
06:57:41,630 --> 06:57:45,930
at least four days in a row here. And I have some stuff that I have to do on the weekend.

1888
06:57:46,729 --> 06:57:54,959
So I fucked up. I don't, hey, no plan. Nancy, whatever you want to call me. Anyways,

1889
06:57:54,959 --> 06:58:04,939
we're almost done with the bits here. We have a goo berry juice. Thanks for the 250. Hey-o,

1890
06:58:04,939 --> 06:58:10,220
Dr985. Just wanted to donate tonight. Just want to point out that one of the funniest things chat

1891
06:58:10,220 --> 06:58:15,659
does is when they point out games no one has ever played, but just talk about it like it's the best

1892
06:58:15,659 --> 06:58:21,659
thing ever. Like I saw one guy call you a four IQ idiot for not playing Stuart Little Two on the DS.

1893
06:58:22,459 --> 06:58:26,590
Well, you haven't played Stuart Little Two on the DS. What are you fucking dumb?

1894
06:58:30,490 --> 06:58:36,200
What's your IQ, dude? What the fuck? Okay. Well, anyways. Also, by the way, can you please play

1895
06:58:37,000 --> 06:58:43,819
Alpha Chimp on the Xbox Live Indie Arcade game service? It's off the market now, but please

1896
06:58:43,819 --> 06:58:55,520
trust me. It's good. I swear. Pepe hands. Please. God. Um, how am I going to get a copy of that?

1897
06:58:56,799 --> 06:59:05,040
Xbox Live Indie game services offline, but get it. How am I going to get it? Please. God. God was

1898
06:59:05,040 --> 06:59:10,830
in all capitals. You haven't played Alpha Chimp. What's wrong with you? What are you fucking two IQ?

1899
06:59:11,630 --> 06:59:20,680
Excuse me. Thanks to goo berry juice. Appreciate it. Please. God. Striker Two. Thanks for the 300

1900
06:59:20,680 --> 06:59:25,720
bits. Hey, Jeremy. Striker Two here again. How do I tell you that I love, love you? Well, you just

1901
06:59:25,720 --> 06:59:33,369
did. Sorry. I'm taken. Thank you for the 300 bits. Bulbaswag Desu. Thanks for the 500 bits.

1902
06:59:33,369 --> 06:59:42,240
Do you have a mental image for us or are we just a mindless blob? Um, you know, I have a mental

1903
06:59:42,240 --> 06:59:53,659
image for chat. I kind of sort of a bunch of, a bunch of small talking dogs, like little dachshunds

1904
06:59:53,659 --> 07:00:14,409
and like chihuahuas and stuff. And they all talk. Everyone has like a dog voice this way, that way,

1905
07:00:14,409 --> 07:00:21,880
this way, that way. No, I, I just, I honestly, emotes. I see you guys as like the emotes that

1906
07:00:21,880 --> 07:00:28,669
you're currently writing. It might be a dog. It might be a smiling face. It might be a rage face.

1907
07:00:28,669 --> 07:00:36,159
I don't know. Hey, bit slave. Thanks again for $5 dude. Fucking Billy egg Pog. Yes. Fuck. Yes.

1908
07:00:36,799 --> 07:00:45,580
Oh, w I just gamer gassed. Holy shit. Thank you. Thank you. Jake lemons for the 300 bits. He's

1909
07:00:45,580 --> 07:00:55,529
playing league with me from Mecca Murph is playing Jake lemons and Mecca Murph are cute. Wait, what's

1910
07:00:55,529 --> 07:01:11,479
going on? Well, I, okay. So you're playing league together. That's not me though. Oh, this is weird.

1911
07:01:11,479 --> 07:01:15,080
You're freaking me out. Goobery juice. Thanks for the 250. I'm just going to throw these bits on

1912
07:01:15,080 --> 07:01:20,520
here. My last donation was too long and to just be 250. That's inaccurate. You can give

1913
07:01:20,520 --> 07:01:24,200
250 and say whatever you want as long as it's, you know, appropriate and you're not

1914
07:01:24,200 --> 07:01:28,959
putting porn codes into a fucking chat room. But thank you. Goobery. Appreciate it.

1915
07:01:30,430 --> 07:01:36,509
Mecca Murph. Thanks for the 1500 bits, 15 more dollars from Mecca Murph's bank account here. I

1916
07:01:36,509 --> 07:01:43,069
am the Arabian Prince. Jake lemons was taught. So I got it right. I said it right. It's Jake's less

1917
07:01:43,069 --> 07:01:49,549
space M O N Z is what he referred to as Jake lemons. I said it right. I was talking about

1918
07:01:49,549 --> 07:01:54,830
playing league with just got back from my deployment from Jordan and Syria. So he calls me that I'm

1919
07:01:54,830 --> 07:02:12,090
currently playing league with him. So don't worry. Welcome back. Welcome back playing league together.

1920
07:02:12,729 --> 07:02:28,299
Is league getting fun? Don't answer that. I know you don't have to answer that because I know it's

1921
07:02:28,299 --> 07:02:35,279
not fun. You don't have to answer it. I already know. Thank you, Mecca Murph. Seriously, both of

1922
07:02:35,279 --> 07:02:41,549
you. Hope you guys having fun together. Off futz. Thanks for the 500 bits. Hi, have a great night.

1923
07:02:41,549 --> 07:02:49,389
You too. Thank you. Jobbed bone. Thanks for the 250. Seriously though, I don't want to hurt what

1924
07:02:49,389 --> 07:02:54,540
mom and I have, but I wanted to know how I feel. This is a you scenario, man. I got nothing for

1925
07:02:54,540 --> 07:03:01,279
you here. I got nothing for you here. This is, this is a you thing. I have nothing. I got nothing

1926
07:03:01,279 --> 07:03:21,919
for you. Have a great night. Thanks a lot. Let's run those credits. What do you say? Stop the music.

1927
07:03:23,150 --> 07:03:28,040
Yeah. Well, the reason why we stopped the music is because we're almost done with the bits,

1928
07:03:28,680 --> 07:03:33,080
but I do want to get these going. We don't need music for this. Here come all the community subs,

1929
07:03:33,080 --> 07:03:37,959
all the new subs, all the old subs, every sub that happened on tonight's stream is going to run by

1930
07:03:37,959 --> 07:03:49,689
you. There it is. Thanks again, guys for supporting the stream. Lots of you. Thank you. Thank you.

1931
07:03:51,599 --> 07:04:00,509
Every single sub from today. What a bunch of nerds. Why did you ban that person for three

1932
07:04:00,509 --> 07:04:11,020
minutes? My sub ran out today. So it's all good. Don't worry. More jelly. Thanks for the 250.

1933
07:04:11,020 --> 07:04:30,490
Jerma, I'm going to go see Blade in Brooklyn in May. Can I get a win? A W. What? I guess.

1934
07:04:31,049 --> 07:04:34,729
Is the movie any good? I don't know. We'll see. Thanks for the 250.

1935
07:04:38,880 --> 07:04:49,080
A bit slave. It's like just came in with 50 more dollars. 5000 bits going nuts on the bits here.

1936
07:04:49,080 --> 07:04:53,880
They say support the troops stream at Mecha Mervin. I need you to play League of Legends.

1937
07:04:53,880 --> 07:04:59,599
Also, the gamer drink of the day is Guinness. Good smooth beer. Drink it now if you're of age.

1938
07:04:59,599 --> 07:05:04,720
Remember to game on gamers. Game the F on also four more days and I'm unbanned from leagues.

1939
07:05:04,720 --> 07:05:12,080
Can we get some fucking pogs in the chat? LOL Tyler1 sponsored this message. I don't think he

1940
07:05:12,080 --> 07:05:24,509
did. He's drinking again. He's drunk again. Don't play League drunk. That's the number one thing.

1941
07:05:24,509 --> 07:05:31,610
Don't do it. Guinness. No, I don't drink Guinness. It's liquid bread. Not for me.

1942
07:05:32,169 --> 07:05:46,779
I can't play League. I'm not playing League. It's not going to happen.

1943
07:05:47,580 --> 07:05:52,459
It's not going to happen. I'm never going to play League. It's never going to happen. I'm sorry.

1944
07:05:52,459 --> 07:05:58,590
German only drinks wine. I mean, I like wine. Red wine. It's fucking good for you. Polyphenols.

1945
07:05:59,229 --> 07:06:11,610
Any polyphenols in liquid fucking sourdough? I don't think so. Thanks a lot for the 5000

1946
07:06:11,610 --> 07:06:25,799
bits though, Bitslave. Really. More jelly. Thanks for the yardie. Did it? That's it. Good for you,

1947
07:06:25,799 --> 07:06:43,340
you wino. Wino. Bitslave. 1500 bits right at the very end. 15 dollars. German, you make me cry if

1948
07:06:43,340 --> 07:06:51,880
I saw one game as Grandpa Diarrhea running down mid. Was that my name in League? My name in League

1949
07:06:51,880 --> 07:06:57,240
was Grandpa Diarrhea? Am I allowed to have that name? Why was I allowed to have that name?

1950
07:06:58,119 --> 07:07:08,459
It seems weird, right? All right. We'll see you tomorrow for Achieve Your Robo. Try to finish it

1951
07:07:08,459 --> 07:07:23,069
tomorrow. Stirr is streaming right now. We're going to go say hi to Stirr. He's doing custom

1952
07:07:23,069 --> 07:07:30,080
workshop balance. I don't know. Apparently he's sick. Sick. But he's not too sick.

1953
07:07:30,880 --> 07:07:43,950
Go show Stirr some love. He's playing Overwatch. I don't know how vile that word was to you all.

Were you going to raid Joel? But just hop around. Hop around. I never catch Star when he's streaming.

He's always not streaming when I stream. I want to say hi. Let's say hi to Star.

Good. Bye. See you tomorrow. Good night.
