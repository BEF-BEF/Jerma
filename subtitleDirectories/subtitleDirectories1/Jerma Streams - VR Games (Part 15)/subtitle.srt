00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:52,409
Hello, everyone. Hi. Can you hear me? That's good. I'm coming through the headset. Here I am. Hi. Oh, me. Good afternoon, everybody. I'm back at my normal setup. Weird stuff at the end of the last stream, but it's okay. We're not going to talk too much about like the kind of haunted shit that I was dealing with. That was kind of weird. But maybe one day we'll talk about it. But it was a little odd for me. He's the imposter.

2
00:00:52,490 --> 00:01:32,659
Oh, we took care of that guy. We took care of the real imposter. And it's me. And it always has been. I haven't gone anywhere. But yeah, we're gonna do VR virtual reality one more time. Because it's still set up. And I don't really want to tear the whole thing down before I play a few more of these games. You don't have a pop filter on it. This is the valve VR headset. Well, I'm sorry, I don't have a pop filter on today. No pop filter.

3
00:01:37,260 --> 00:02:07,189
Oh, speaking of audio, I want to talk about this too really quickly. I'm going to bring this up like three times throughout the stream because I feel like it's important. So during the during the replacement stream, the audio got all fucked up a bunch of times, right? That was because we had some connection problems to twitch. And it was like feedbacking back to the stream. It was a weird connection problem. But huge, huge, awesome.

4
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:27,270
News here, we have the studio recording that is currently on the archive channel. So 90% of those shitty audio problems that you heard randomly through the stream, almost all of them are gone. So we got the actual studio recording. If you want to watch some of those scenes that you may have been kind of

5
00:02:27,270 --> 00:03:07,300
unintelligible. They are available. Because the that VOD on the archive channel, clean audio for the most part, there's still some problems, but it's okay. Stream saved. The director's cut. Yeah, I'm not gonna have no pop filter. So I'm really happy about that. Because I don't know people were talking about they were getting like weird twitch errors on that stream too. And we have the connection problems we had throughout that stream. I'm glad that like 90% of that stream was fine.

6
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:29,430
But it's pretty much fixed on the VOD. So that's good. What about the POG filter? Oh, there's a shitload of new emotes I put on from VT, VTTV. Yeah, I sound weird because I'm talking I'm holding this headset upside down. It's, I sound it's like you're inside of my mouth right now. It's weird.

7
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:38,699
Anyways, we are going to get started. The first game on tap for the day.

8
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,539
Game called detective

9
00:03:43,939 --> 00:03:48,979
Roe Hill, detective case files and there's audio popping in my ear.

10
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:58,289
All right, let me get let me get on here. Not frog detective.

11
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,710
This is probably gonna be really loud. Please tell me if it is.

12
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,020
Hey, what's happening?

13
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:36,329

14
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:51,420
Because the whole thing goes into the package that it came in. And I literally put the package into a closet and don't touch it. It is literally dust on it when I take it out. I'm in

15
00:04:52,870 --> 00:05:03,480
Kind of I'm getting like rumbles. All right, my pants are on. Can I see you guys? I can. They are. That sounds like VR. All right, let's go.

16
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:16,430
Oh, an anonymous skifter can skip five community subs. We went over this. I dealt with a little bit of weird shit in the hotel room. That's fine. I took I took care of it.

17
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:23,100
You know what I tell you about my favorite part about that last stream was even though I was being haunted.

18
00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:39,639
God, my favorite part of that stream is remember when I was yelling Aaron. Oh, that was my favorite part. That was my absolute favorite part of that entire broadcast. I cannot tell you how much fun it was for me to say Aaron loudly. Oh my God, I loved it.

19
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:46,629
All right, let's go. New game Crow Hill detective case files.

20
00:05:53,149 --> 00:06:02,790

21
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:20,860
You know what I mean? And like, when are we when are we going to get over that part? Right? Oh, it's kind of hard. I can't really see that much. Hey, what do I guy that knows VR really well? What do I do? Oh, well, what you have to do is you have to tighten it till it hurts. Oh, okay.

22
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:47,660
Yeah, that hurts. Good. Now you can see it's not blurring anymore. All right, left thumb stick and right the teleporting and rotating. Okay. Well, that's walking. Hello, detective. You got some messages. All right. Who's this? Okay.

26
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,480
By the way, according to the latest report, a lady in a hat was spotted, it seems. Be careful.

00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:51,909
My joke wasn't even funny. What's happening? I'm like a grandma. Oh, this is it right here. Detective. What was that? I'm so freaked out right now. What the fuck? Should I shot him?

Okay, press right button to open inventory. Right button. Oh, my God. What is this? Like fucking a seance. Okay, easy. Gear. This can be used for opening the bunker door.

34
00:12:28,799 --> 00:13:15,110
Why am I taking these? Okay, put this up here in my like Diablo skill tree. Can you guys, is it too loud? Equip the table. All right, I'm ready. Holy shit, that's a nice car. Is it too loud? Okay. If you drop something from inventory and reload the scene, you will still get it. Nice. Good developer. Good dev. I know what I got to do here. What?

35
00:13:28,000 --> 00:14:07,139
Okay, so I got to find the key to that thing. How do I reload? Does that reload? What? Oh, my God. What the fuck? Open the wait. I got it. I got it. I got it. Why can't I pick that up now? All right, I'm ready to shoot the fucking lock.

36

37
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:42,669
What? Teleport turning inventory menu quest. I shot that guy in the face like 10 times. Okay, let's go. I'm gonna try one more time. Okay, quick gun. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm not done with this game yet.

38
00:15:42,669 --> 00:16:02,460
The area around the crow asylum. I just received another complaint. But go ahead and investigate the area. But by the way, according to the latest report, a lady in a hat was spotted. It seems we good. Be careful. What? What? Hold on.

39
00:16:02,460 --> 00:17:06,349
Drop in some frames. Oh, well, during the game up, it's quiet. That's weird. All right, let me get back into this. That was like one of the most ridiculous five minutes I think ever. I don't even know what was going on. Oh my god, it's so dark in here. It's like it was dark in here. All right, back in. So what am I supposed to just run from that guy? Yes, yes, I just tried to pick the gun up with my real hand. Yes, I did. Did I turn the lights off in this game somehow? What just happened? Did I turn the lights off in this game somehow? What just happened? Did I turn the lights off in this game somehow? What just happened? Did I turn the lights off in this game somehow? What just happened? Did I turn the lights off in this game somehow? What just happened? Did I turn the lights off in this game somehow? What just happened? Did I turn the lights off in this game somehow? What just happened?

40
00:17:06,349 --> 00:18:13,869
I just turned the lights on over there and the lights turned off here. That was pretty weird. All right, let's go. All right, I'm not going to fuck this up now. Let's do it. Wait, we're going to go in the car again, aren't we? All right, car time. Close your eyes because it's like going to make me throw up. Can I go faster at least? Wait, I am driving the car. Is that the moon? What game is this called Crowville? Is there a save? Why are you guys saying audio? Do you have your parking brake on?

41
00:18:13,869 --> 00:19:01,519
Oh, what do I hit? The game is too quiet. Should I turn the game up actually? Is it too loud? You guys are just fucking with me. I feel like Fred Flintstone. Like I'm walking right now. I'm running with the car. Check your blinker. No, it's fine. All right. All right. All right. So now let me figure out what the hell I'm supposed to do here. I got to get the key. But there's like a weird. All right. All right. All right.

42
00:19:01,519 --> 00:20:10,140
Pick up the animals. Pick up the animals. Pick up the animals. Where'd it go? Where'd the clip go? Where's the clip? I just had it. What happened to the clip? Under here probably. What the fuck just happened? What happened to the clip? Is it gone? Wait. Oh my fucking God. I don't even know where the clip is. Under the bench. I just looked under the bench. It's not here. I have to do it without it. It's under there.

43
00:20:10,140 --> 00:21:12,900
Just run. How do I run? Is there a run? Wait, you saw it? How do I run? I have to be able to run, right? Next game, please. Don't just wait. Push in the sticks. All right. I'm just gonna go by and see what happens. Go, go, go, go. Where's the key? Where's the key? He can't hit me if I'm inside of his body. Yeah, he can. I trapped him. I trapped him. How the fuck do you run? All right, we're gonna move on. I'm not doing that again. I'm not doing it again.

44
00:21:12,900 --> 00:22:06,910
That game has potential though. That game had so much potential. You know it does. There's so much potential. I love this game. What should I do? Sweet. Last attempt, I swear to God. Somebody's made a good point. I'm gonna do seated VR and use the teleport. I promise this is the last time I'm gonna try this. I think this game has potential. I'm not going anywhere. Just give me a minute. Seated. Wait, what? Hold on. Wait, what? It was already unseated. All right. Maybe that was what the problem was. Left thumb stick and right thumb stick.

45
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:17,059
I don't think that's how this works. All right, last try. I'm gonna make sure I have the gun and I'm gonna run. I'm gonna shoot the guy and kill him. Go.

46
00:22:22,059 --> 00:22:25,059
All right, no distractions. Go, go, go.

47
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:38,740
Oh, no. Not about the guy with the axe, right? We don't care about that guy. I promise this is the last time you're gonna see me do this. Dude.

48
00:22:42,349 --> 00:23:03,490
Go. Okay, we need to see what I'm actually running over. Somebody pay attention, please. All right, what am I hitting? I can't even look out there. Is it a bird?

49
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:21,900
All right, if it scares me again, I'm gonna gift a hundred community subs. I'm looking. I'm looking. There are the birds. Okay, here come the birds.

50
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:43,180
Flying. Fuck. I have to give a hundred subs. It's not one of the birds. It's not one of the birds. I've run over somebody on the ground.

51
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:55,019
All right, no messing around. Everybody relax. Calm down. Just sit down. Some of you guys are standing up and pointing at your monitors screaming obscenities at me, which first of all, offensive.

52
00:23:55,019 --> 00:24:11,730
Second of all, sit down. I'm gonna get it this time. I'll get it this time. Hundred subs, yeah. Okay, I'm ready.

53
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:30,079
But first, first and foremost. No, don't. I don't want to lose this. I need that. Stop. My underwear is definitely showing right now.

54
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:44,809
Okay, good. This is ready. Give me the gear. I have to kill the guy over there. He definitely has the key. I have to kill that guy.

55
00:24:44,809 --> 00:24:59,769
Anything in the car? Wait, what's that? I have to kill that guy.

56
00:24:59,769 --> 00:25:22,130
Okay, so I have to. I have to kill this demon. Use the table as a shield. Holy fuck, what a genius. What an absolute gosh darn genius that person is.

57
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:33,069
Can I save the game? I don't think I can save the game.

58
00:25:46,240 --> 00:26:01,759
All right, let's go motherfucker. I'm ready. Just roll it down the hill. All right, slow down so I gotta get this in the right spot.

59
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:47,519
This way a little. That way a little. Come on, you bastard. It didn't work. It didn't work. What the fuck, dude?

60
00:26:47,519 --> 00:27:24,609
Where's the key? We're going to move on. That was fun though. It probably gets so much more fun. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right.

61
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:37,299
Changing game. Man. Okay, so we're going to move on to. Let's see where we're going to go. Let's find out. We have to go back to.

62
00:27:37,299 --> 00:27:56,910
I got so many games. Where's the other one that I wanted to play? There's like at least five games. Where are they? What was it called? Shit, I can't see it on my list.

63
00:27:56,910 --> 00:28:16,880
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Come on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Oh, there it is. Four warned. Four warned is the game we're going to play.

64
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:22,579
This one looks really fun. This is a horror game, apparently. Just to let you know.

65
00:28:22,579 --> 00:28:44,660
Let me capture it. This is a sick game. All right, cool. Let's see. Among Us VR is not out. Four warned. That game was fun. I wish it was funner.

66
00:28:44,660 --> 00:29:09,009
Among Us VR is not out yet. Everybody that says that from here on out is going to get a 600 year ban in goldfish years.

67
00:29:09,009 --> 00:29:24,240
Everybody that says that from here on out is going to get a 600 year ban in goldfish years.

68
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:36,690
All right. So here we go. So what do I do? Can I see you? I can. Early access. Right. All right. So I got a utility belt. It's kind of dark.

69
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:40,589
I think I just go out the door, right? All right, let's go.

70
00:29:40,589 --> 00:29:51,140
Thank you for supporting Four Warned with your purchase. The game is currently in early access with new content actually being developed.

72
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:02,140
All entities, even those based on real names, places and events are fictional. This game uses proximity and global voice chat.

73
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:21,630
Wait, is this a multiplayer game? Connect to the lobby to host? Oh, shit. I don't have any people to play that this...

74
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:33,029
I thought this was... Oh, it's one to four players. This is just... It's Phasmophobia. Oh, what the fuck?

75
00:30:33,029 --> 00:30:38,029
I didn't know. All right. Save this for the next time we play. All right. Save this for the next time. I'll get some friends.

76
00:30:38,029 --> 00:30:48,380
I wasn't prepared for this. All right. We're pivoting. I want to... Okay. This is a four player game. I'm going to do a VR friends night.

77
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:57,119
All right. We're going to... What? I expect you to die too? Yeah, I'll try this.

78
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:19,539
And then we got cooking simulator coming up. This is a seated experience. Oh, shit. Seated experience. You got it. How's this?

79
00:31:19,539 --> 00:31:27,859
Don't stand when you play this. Is that a bad place for the camera? Yeah, whatever. Who cares? You can see me.

80
00:31:27,859 --> 00:31:41,059
All right. This game came out a while ago, but I never played it. So let's give it a try. Classic VR experience here.

81
00:31:41,059 --> 00:31:48,059
All right. Let's go. No save data. This is the game that goes... I expect you to die.

82
00:31:49,059 --> 00:31:58,480
Can you hear me? Don't worry. The briefcase is safe. Do you remember what happened? Your memory is a puzzle game and it's going to be very tricky.

83
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:06,480
Well, take all the time you need. You're back at headquarters and you're perfectly safe. You'll find a tape on the desk in front of you.

84
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:13,480
Load the tape into the projector console on your right. Now, I imagine you might recognize that bomb disposal device in front of you.

85
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:20,480
Oh, yeah. Bomb disposal. Given the wear and tear, it might be the same one. Oh, no. A puzzle game.

86
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:25,480
Well, I'm sure it still works. Now, let's see. What do I do?

87
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,480
Ah, yes. There it goes. Just a bit further.

88
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:37,000
Whoa. So realistic. Okay, that scared me. Disarm the bomb.

89
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:48,799
All right. This is a time bomb. Do I need to spin the wheel? Oh, wait. What? Oh, that was easy.

90
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:58,799
Wonderful. Yes. Next, the machine should dispense a grenade. Ah, there it is. Where? Let's use it to test out that telekinetic implant of yours.

91
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:12,529
Oh, no. I love this game. All right, cool. Push thumb stick forward to aim and then grab pick up. Reel it in.

92
00:33:13,529 --> 00:33:19,529
Now, try using your telekinesis to hover the grenade nearby. Press A while holding an object.

93
00:33:19,529 --> 00:33:26,529
Good. Your telekinesis is still working. Oh, I hear that when those things malfunction, it's usually very messy. Okay.

94
00:33:26,529 --> 00:33:32,529
Now to dispose of that grenade. Use your telekinesis to place it inside the blast chamber.

95
00:33:32,529 --> 00:33:37,529
So I go like this and then pick up that remote detonator so you can explode the chamber's contents.

96
00:33:37,529 --> 00:33:54,420
Forward. You hold it. Go like this. Pull it. Forward. Pull. Grab it. Forward. Grab it. Push it forward. Disposal. Forward. Close. Easy.

97
00:33:54,420 --> 00:34:19,579
Press the trigger button to use held objects. Cool hat. Where is it? It's on the table. Oh, that thing.

98
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:30,300
I expect you to die. For your final test, you will need to dispose of three more explosives hidden around the examination room.

99
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:45,730
Good luck. I'll give you a list so you know what you're looking for. E-O-D-R-O-Z-N-H-O-J-T-N-C-G-A-C-O-C-Z-N-B-A-E-P-I-B-F-J.

100
00:34:45,730 --> 00:35:00,619
I can't do the rest. All right, disarm the rest of the stuff. Hidden around the room? What? You guys see anything?

101
00:35:00,619 --> 00:35:17,579
Uh, okay. Probably behind all this stuff, right? Oh, hold on. Every movie. Every single movie.

102
00:35:17,579 --> 00:35:28,769
Yeah, I think I'll... Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Well, I'll be there at noon. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. No. Tell them I can't be there.

103
00:35:28,769 --> 00:35:43,869
I don't know. Why do they do that in every fucking movie? The person will... The main character will sit there and have like foam coming out of his mouth and just grinding his teeth for an entire scene.

104
00:35:43,869 --> 00:35:52,760
Nobody does that. That was a plus two and I... That was plus two. You just don't get it. You didn't watch movies in the fucking 90s.

105
00:35:52,760 --> 00:36:35,119
All right. Where's like a... Where are these explosives? Can somebody help me? Open up under the clipboard. Gas bomb. Time bombs. Where's this gas bomb?

106
00:36:35,119 --> 00:37:11,099
Oh, there it is. All right. This is definitely a bomb. Not yet. There it is. All right. Got that one. What about over here? This is definitely a bomb. Without a doubt. No, it's not. What about that? What's this?

107
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:26,519
That's definitely a bomb. Oops. All right. So that was the... That was... I need a gas bomb. Cover over the clipboard. Press A.

108
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:29,519
Wait. Was I supposed to do this the whole time?

109
00:37:39,989 --> 00:38:13,340
Okay. I don't... I didn't understand. Is it behind me? Oh. Oh. Found it. Did I get it? What's this? Salt? Ranch dressing or something?

110
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:47,139
There's another... There's another thing here. Where is it? Is there like a cupboard or something I can go into? Where's this last one? Behind here? Oh. Turn the sink on. No. No. Help. Desk drawer. Oh, man. Look at that. Thank you.

111
00:38:47,139 --> 00:39:04,739
Good work, agent. You passed all of the tests with flying colors. All right. Let's go. I'm going to have my epostatic ranch dressing. I'm ready. Don't worry, agent. I've got everything.

112
00:39:04,739 --> 00:39:15,309
This game's going to be fun. This game's going to be fun. I believe so. And I'm sitting down so I can stay here for a while.

113
00:39:16,309 --> 00:39:20,130
Shell Games presents... Oh, here it comes.

114
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:32,760
I expect you to die. Die. I expect you to die. You'll die.

115
00:39:53,880 --> 00:40:11,219
My personal orchestra.

116
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:19,699
Hey.

117
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:27,719
I'm not in a car.

118
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:36,199
This skull.

119
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:42,570
I feel like I'm watching a movie with you guys. We're just watching a movie. I'm just sitting here watching.

120
00:40:45,570 --> 00:41:02,570
I could never watch Born in VR. I'm just saying. I'm just telling you. I could never sit here and watch Born on VR. No fucking way. It would never happen.

121
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:06,570
I don't know how people do that. How do people do this?

122
00:41:11,619 --> 00:41:12,619
I could not.

123
00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:30,690
No! You don't have to ask. This is the first time I've ever...

124
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:42,400
Wait till the song ends. That was really good. That was a really cool intro. That was at least an eight and a half to nine out of ten.

125
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:52,969
Okay, so this is the first time I've ever sat just sitting here in VR. I've never done seated VR before, really. I could never do this.

126
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:56,969
Zoraxis?

127
00:41:59,969 --> 00:42:02,969
Zoraxis? Wait, what is this person's name?

128
00:42:08,969 --> 00:42:09,969
Zoraxis!

129
00:42:09,969 --> 00:42:22,969
Game sucks ass.

130
00:42:27,969 --> 00:42:28,969
I can't break this?

131
00:42:29,969 --> 00:42:32,969
Oh man. Refunded. Refunded immediately.

132
00:42:33,969 --> 00:42:40,679
What's this thing called? Operation...

133
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:48,920
Protect this guy.

134
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,920
Protect the Prime Minister.

135
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:01,920
Alright, cool. Report available upon completion. Let's go for it.

136
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:09,380
Let's get you undercover so we can figure out what Zoraxis is up to.

137
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:11,380
How do I let go of this machine?

138
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:14,380
Get my hand off this.

139
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:22,380
Four days ago. Okay. Oh shit.

140
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:27,260
I'm gonna fail this. I can't play this game. What do I do?

141
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:33,260
My instincts were right. This place is crawling with Zoraxis operatives.

142
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:40,260
Now you're all set up backstage. Maintain your cover as a stagehand until you can find and disable the threat.

143
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:41,260
Okay.

144
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:45,260
I managed to snag a ticket to the show, so I'll keep an eye on the Prime Minister.

145
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:47,260
Let's make this show to remember, people. Okay.

146
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:48,260
Banner's down.

147
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:49,260
Banner's down.

148
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:53,260
He's much more grandfatherly than I expected.

149
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:55,260
Okay, wait, wait, wait. What does it need to look like?

150
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:56,260
Find out what Zoraxis is up to.

151
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:58,260
Okay, Banner's... Set the stage.

152
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:07,949
What happened to that sound designer?

153
00:44:07,949 --> 00:44:09,949
What happened to Jerry?

154
00:44:09,949 --> 00:44:10,949
How far down does this have to go?

155
00:44:10,949 --> 00:44:14,949
Set the stage, everyone. I want an impeccable performance from all of you.

156
00:44:14,949 --> 00:44:21,949
Oh. You up there. Up in the catwalk. Be sure to follow the new instructions I left on your clipboard.

157
00:44:21,949 --> 00:44:23,949
That voice sounds familiar.

158
00:44:23,949 --> 00:44:24,949
What the hell is happening?

159
00:44:24,949 --> 00:44:26,949
Stay on your guard, agent.

160
00:44:26,949 --> 00:44:34,309
How far down does that have to go? Two of this.

161
00:44:34,309 --> 00:44:37,059
Banner's down. All the way?

162
00:44:37,059 --> 00:44:43,500
Okay, Banner's are down. Clock R100G10000.

163
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:55,789
10000. Excuse me. 10000, please.

164
00:44:55,789 --> 00:45:00,500
Excuse me. 10000, please. How do I do this?

165
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,260
What's going on?

166
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:06,710
What's happening? What's happening?

167
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:08,710
I can't... What's wrong with my hand?

168
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:10,019
What's happening?

169
00:45:10,019 --> 00:45:20,099
Dude, what am I connecting? I'm connected to something.

170
00:45:20,099 --> 00:45:27,530
I can't let go.

171
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:32,179
No help. You're taking L's.

172
00:45:32,179 --> 00:45:37,349
I understand, but how do I stop being in the grip mode?

173
00:45:37,349 --> 00:45:41,449
I can't touch anything.

174
00:45:41,449 --> 00:45:47,059
Uh. No help. No help.

175
00:45:47,059 --> 00:45:49,059
The ratio.

176
00:45:49,059 --> 00:45:54,039
Like, why...

177
00:45:54,039 --> 00:45:59,300
Let go of whatever you are fucking holding.

178
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:01,300
What am I holding with this?

179
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:10,219
What? I'm so confused right now.

180
00:46:10,219 --> 00:46:11,219
What is going on?

181
00:46:11,219 --> 00:46:16,219
I need to restart?

182
00:46:16,219 --> 00:46:23,260
Dude, I can't even hit the restart button.

183
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:24,260
What happened?

184
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:31,150
Take the headset off.

185
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:34,150
Okay, that gave me... That freed up my left hand.

186
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:37,150
My right hand is still holding onto something.

187
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:46,880
Like, am I holding this?

188
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,880
Still? What does the game think I'm holding onto?

189
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,500
Slow... Do a flip.

190
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:55,730
I... Okay.

191
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:58,730
I literally just gripped for a second and now they're stuck.

192
00:46:58,730 --> 00:47:07,750
I don't know what to do. I don't understand what's going on.

193
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:09,750
I think I have to restart the game.

194
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:12,500
Worst VR gamer.

195
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:16,059
Look, Mom! Look, Mom! Look!

196
00:47:16,059 --> 00:47:18,059
Oh, I thought that I could do about this.

197
00:47:18,059 --> 00:47:31,210
Oh my God, what the... What is happening?

198
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:41,170
It won't let me do it. I'm about to leave the game.

199
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:43,539
Okay, don't... Nobody fucking move.

200
00:47:43,539 --> 00:47:51,110
What?

201
00:47:51,110 --> 00:48:02,679
Uh, this game doesn't work.

202
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:06,480
I'm about to leave it.

203
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,480
I'm gonna... Let me turn the controllers off and on.

204
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:18,719
Get me out of the game! Get me out! Get me out now!

205
00:48:18,719 --> 00:48:31,010
Wait, what is... Josh, what did you say?

206
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:32,010
Josh said something.

207
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:38,510
Game might be tabbed out on the PC.

208
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:48,400
What? Can you see?

209
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:53,750
Dude, why can I press the button once and then never again?

210
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:58,019
Holy shit, what's with these fucking games not working?

211
00:48:58,019 --> 00:49:08,960
Are you sitting under the sensor?

212
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,960
No, it was working for the first, like, 20, 30 minutes.

213
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:14,579
Let me try to restart it.

214
00:49:14,579 --> 00:49:16,210
Stupid.

215
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:19,280
Fucking VR.

216
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:23,219
I'm gonna dropkick this off the roof of my house when I'm done.

217
00:49:23,219 --> 00:49:25,980
Like, am I... Okay, hold on a second.

218
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:32,320
Yeah, okay, so what... I don't know.

219
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,320
I'm just gonna reload it.

220
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:45,110
Oh, you know what? Fuck it, we're playing this other game.

221
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:48,820
That just pissed me off more than anything.

222
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:50,820
That just pissed me off.

223
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:52,820
Uh, not playing it anymore.

224
00:49:52,820 --> 00:50:04,730
Well, now my SteamVR just crashed.

225
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:12,860
Fuck, dude.

226
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:18,420
Okay, wait. Is it here?

227
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:20,920
Can anybody see it?

228
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:24,500
Jesus Christ.

229
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:26,500
Okay, we're gonna play Furious Seas.

230
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:28,500
I hope it works.

231
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:33,409
When are we gonna get out of the tech demo stage of VR?

232
00:50:33,409 --> 00:50:36,579
I know every VR stream is a rant stream, but holy shit.

233
00:50:36,579 --> 00:50:42,019
Like, when did the fucking Vive come out?

234
00:50:42,019 --> 00:50:45,019
Like, 2015 or something? 2016?

235
00:50:45,019 --> 00:50:49,219
Are we ever gonna get out of the fucking demo stage of VR?

236
00:50:49,219 --> 00:50:52,039
Or is there just gonna be permanent demos? Forever.

237
00:50:52,039 --> 00:50:55,880
Alright, let's see. Does this work?

238
00:50:55,880 --> 00:51:01,769
Okay, this is called Furious Seas.

239
00:51:01,769 --> 00:51:06,739
Ooh! How do I shoot it?

240
00:51:06,739 --> 00:51:11,800
Do I have to reload it? Oh, this is gonna be fun.

241
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,800
Okay. Explore.

242
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:29,480
It's just constantly mad.

243
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,480
Alright, hold on.

244
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:33,480
Get this fucking chair out of the way.

245
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:35,909
I'm gonna run into that.

246
00:51:35,909 --> 00:51:37,909
I'm gonna fall over that.

247
00:51:37,909 --> 00:51:40,340
That's where you're gonna get your real laugh out loud moment.

248
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:43,349
Alright, I can go to the shop?

249
00:51:43,349 --> 00:51:45,349
Switch ammo. Pull the lever for switching ammo.

250
00:51:45,349 --> 00:51:48,300
Okay, cool. So, grab to steer.

251
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:50,300
Press any button to continue.

252
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:52,300
Pretty simple. Pretty easy, I think.

253
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:54,300
Alright, let's go.

254
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:56,300
Wanted. William Avery.

255
00:52:06,969 --> 00:52:08,969
Why does it think I'm way smaller?

256
00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:13,530
Hit the audio.

257
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:18,199
Okay, so let's go with you.

258
00:52:22,039 --> 00:52:29,349
Okay. Start a mission. Grab the poster on the table and place it on this board.

259
00:52:29,349 --> 00:52:31,349
Alright, let's go.

260
00:52:31,349 --> 00:52:35,059
Yeah, why is it audio?

261
00:52:35,059 --> 00:52:37,059
And, ladies and gentlemen, your winner

262
00:52:37,059 --> 00:52:43,510
for VR Game of the Year.

263
00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:45,510
Look down. There's a spider on your leg.

264
00:52:45,510 --> 00:52:47,820
When are we gonna get out of... Never mind.

265
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:51,340
Okay, let's go.

266
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:57,429
William Avery, the cowardly bastard son of Captain Rue and Location, Yolefin Island.

267
00:52:57,429 --> 00:52:59,429
15,000 gold. I'm ready. Let's go.

268
00:52:59,429 --> 00:53:01,429
I'm ready.

269
00:53:01,429 --> 00:53:03,429
Is that...

270
00:53:03,429 --> 00:53:06,500
I'm not supposed to close your shop.

271
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:09,699
Where's the boat?

272
00:53:09,699 --> 00:53:11,699
Same rant.

273
00:53:11,699 --> 00:53:16,380
Alright, hold on.

274
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:18,380
Speed. I can go slower or faster.

275
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:20,380
Mines. Toss barrels into the water.

276
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:23,260
Pick up raft.

277
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:25,260
For power-ups, okay.

278
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:27,260
Alright, let's go.

279
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:29,260
Let me play a fucking game.

280
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:32,969
Am I the lighthouse?

281
00:53:32,969 --> 00:53:34,969
They took everything.

282
00:53:34,969 --> 00:53:36,969
My ship, my money,

283
00:53:36,969 --> 00:53:38,969
even my dead father's ring.

284
00:53:38,969 --> 00:53:40,969
Pillaged by the pirate league called the Crimson Bandits.

285
00:53:40,969 --> 00:53:42,969
Why am I just so wrong?

286
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:44,969
They took everything.

287
00:53:44,969 --> 00:53:46,969
My ship, my money,

288
00:53:46,969 --> 00:53:48,969
even my dead father's ring.

289
00:53:48,969 --> 00:53:50,969
Why am I just so wrong?

290
00:53:50,969 --> 00:53:53,659
The Crimson Pile.

291
00:53:53,659 --> 00:53:55,659
I had ignored them for far too long.

292
00:53:55,659 --> 00:53:57,659
I had ignored them for far too long.

293
00:53:57,659 --> 00:53:59,659
No longer.

294
00:53:59,659 --> 00:54:01,960
I'm gonna hunt them all down.

295
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:04,199
One by one, from that singing

296
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:06,199
Flunky Tales Avery

297
00:54:06,199 --> 00:54:08,199
to their insane leader,

298
00:54:08,199 --> 00:54:10,889
Captain Rue.

299
00:54:10,889 --> 00:54:12,889
I've got nothing left to lose.

300
00:54:12,889 --> 00:54:14,889
Complain stream.

301
00:54:14,889 --> 00:54:16,889
They have so much I can take.

302
00:54:16,889 --> 00:54:18,889
Exactly.

303
00:54:18,889 --> 00:54:20,889
That's what he said, okay?

304
00:54:20,889 --> 00:54:25,110
Furious...

305
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:31,260
Says.

306
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:38,679
So where do I go? Where's my ship?

307
00:54:38,679 --> 00:54:40,679
I'm so ready for this.

308
00:54:40,679 --> 00:54:42,679
I have to get rid of that, because that should not be there.

309
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:46,070
Okay, let's go.

310
00:54:46,070 --> 00:54:48,070
I know, you pull the lever and move up and down to zoom in and out.

311
00:54:48,070 --> 00:54:50,500
Pull the lever, we got mines and shit.

312
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:56,500
This old sloop was all I was able to beg for to take on the Crimson Bandits.

313
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:59,500
She's a bit old and smells like cabbage.

314
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,500
Is this supposed to be happening?

315
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,500
Is this okay?

316
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,500
I'm just making sure this is supposed to be happening.

317
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:10,380
Alright.

318
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:12,880
Dead ahead.

319
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,880
Those islands are where Tales' supply ships have been spotted.

320
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,880
Wait!

321
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,880
I sink those and I'll get his attention.

322
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,059
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

323
00:55:21,059 --> 00:55:23,059
I need my...I gotta turn this off.

324
00:55:23,059 --> 00:55:30,210
Or is it?

325
00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:33,219
That's gonna fuck with me.

326
00:55:33,219 --> 00:55:35,219
Alright.

327
00:55:35,219 --> 00:55:39,219
If I ring the right bell, my crew will raise sails and we'll be underway.

328
00:55:39,219 --> 00:55:43,219
Or if I ring the left bell, the sails will be lowered and we'll stop.

329
00:55:43,219 --> 00:55:46,219
Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

330
00:55:46,219 --> 00:55:47,219
Alright, we're going too fast.

331
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:51,820
How do I slow down?

332
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:53,820
Where are we supposed to go?

333
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:56,380
I wanna slow down, I don't wanna go this fast.

334
00:55:56,380 --> 00:56:00,349
Oh, we gotta go that way, to the island.

335
00:56:00,349 --> 00:56:04,170
Captain, Tales' supply ships are somewhere close.

336
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:07,730
I'll need to look around and to find them.

337
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:10,730
Alright, do I actually get off the boat?

338
00:56:10,730 --> 00:56:13,289
Alright, slow down.

339
00:56:13,289 --> 00:56:17,579
I see an island over there.

340
00:56:17,579 --> 00:56:23,219
I just need to pull the trigger to open fire.

341
00:56:23,219 --> 00:56:27,000
Double shot, loaded!

342
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:32,889
Don't turn...hold on.

343
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:34,889
Okay, I can't actually shoot him, right?

344
00:56:40,579 --> 00:56:42,079
Whoa!

345
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:44,079
Holy shit!

346
00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:49,090
Okay, wait, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

347
00:56:49,090 --> 00:56:53,500
How do I...

348
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:54,500
So what do we do?

349
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:55,500
Anybody see anything?

350
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:58,059
Oh shit, it's a boat!

351
00:56:58,059 --> 00:57:03,269
Get him!

352
00:57:03,269 --> 00:57:05,269
Oh my god, we're gonna hit the island.

353
00:57:05,269 --> 00:57:08,269
Stop, stop, hit the brake, hit the brake, hit the brake, hit the brake!

354
00:57:08,269 --> 00:57:09,269
Oh no!

355
00:57:09,269 --> 00:57:11,269
Okay, wait!

356
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,440
Get him!

357
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,500
We did it!

358
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:20,500
Nice job, man.

359
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:23,500
Always a pity when someone messes with your livelihood.

360
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:24,500
Alright, how do we turn?

361
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:26,500
Ready to fire!

362
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:28,630
Alright, go faster.

363
00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:31,630
Tales must have more ships around here somewhere.

364
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:34,630
Ah, a few more of Tales' ships.

365
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:36,630
And it looks like one of them is armed.

366
00:57:36,630 --> 00:57:38,630
This job just got more exciting.

367
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:40,630
This isn't a car, dude.

368
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:42,630
Wait, what, did we just phase through that?

369
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:44,630
Alright, go fast, fast, fast!

370
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:49,380
We gotta be ready, load it!

371
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:56,170
Oh, I don't have to do that.

372
00:57:56,170 --> 00:57:58,170
I don't have to do that.

373
00:57:58,170 --> 00:57:59,170
Here we go!

374
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:04,179
Fire up!

375
00:58:04,179 --> 00:58:16,500
Faster!

376
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:18,500
Faster, you bastards!

377
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:26,559
I need more ammo!

378
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:33,300
Got him.

379
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:39,260
Everybody alright?

380
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:47,900
Shit, lower.

381
00:58:55,219 --> 00:58:56,219
Got him!

382
00:58:56,219 --> 00:58:57,219
Nice job, boys.

383
00:58:57,219 --> 00:58:58,219
Nice job.

384
00:59:09,579 --> 00:59:11,019
What is it?

385
00:59:13,019 --> 00:59:14,019
I can't see!

386
00:59:14,019 --> 00:59:15,019
I can't see!

387
00:59:15,019 --> 00:59:17,019
A piece of trash hit me in the face!

388
00:59:17,019 --> 00:59:18,019
Where am I going?

389
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:20,260
What does it say?

390
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:22,389
Level complete.

391
00:59:22,389 --> 00:59:23,389
Alright.

392
00:59:23,389 --> 00:59:24,389
Bounty.

393
00:59:24,389 --> 00:59:25,389
So now what?

394
00:59:25,389 --> 00:59:29,829
What do I do now?

395
00:59:29,829 --> 00:59:32,989
Oh, I just win.

396
00:59:32,989 --> 00:59:33,989
Alright, cool.

397
00:59:33,989 --> 00:59:34,989
Alright, that was kind of fun.

398
00:59:34,989 --> 00:59:35,989
I'll do another mission.

399
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:40,820
Nice.

400
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:42,699
Alright.

401
00:59:42,699 --> 00:59:43,699
Speed.

402
00:59:43,699 --> 00:59:45,059
Ramming.

403
00:59:45,059 --> 00:59:48,880
Bring right bell three times to ram.

404
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:49,880
No way.

405
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:51,380
Really?

406
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:52,380
Are we ready?

407
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:53,380
Wait.

408
00:59:53,380 --> 01:00:10,829
I want ramming speed.

409
01:00:10,829 --> 01:00:11,829
Uh...

410
01:00:11,829 --> 01:00:12,829
Shit!

411
01:00:12,829 --> 01:00:14,840
Turn!

412
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:15,840
He's...

413
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:19,130
Somebody shoot him!

414
01:00:19,130 --> 01:00:21,900
Alright, go!

415
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:23,590
Oh, there.

416
01:00:23,590 --> 01:00:24,590
Fuck, now.

417
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:25,590
What?

418
01:00:25,590 --> 01:00:26,590
How is...

419
01:00:26,590 --> 01:00:28,409
How would you get away from that?

420
01:00:28,409 --> 01:00:32,400
Oh, I got gold.

421
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,400
Line it up.

422
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,730
Damn it.

423
01:00:35,730 --> 01:00:36,730
How are you supposed to ram people?

424
01:00:36,730 --> 01:00:37,969
There's only one guy on this boat.

425
01:00:37,969 --> 01:00:39,849
What the fuck?

426
01:00:39,849 --> 01:00:40,849
Oh, get him, get him, get him!

427
01:00:40,849 --> 01:00:41,849
We're fine!

428
01:00:41,849 --> 01:00:49,539
Shit!

429
01:00:49,539 --> 01:00:50,539
Oh, shit!

430
01:00:50,539 --> 01:01:01,309
Oh, shit!

431
01:01:01,309 --> 01:01:07,929
Oh, shit!

432
01:01:07,929 --> 01:01:08,929
Oh, shit!

433
01:01:08,929 --> 01:01:09,929
Oh, shit!

434
01:01:09,929 --> 01:01:11,679
Oh, shit!

435
01:01:11,679 --> 01:01:12,679
Oh, shit!

436
01:01:12,679 --> 01:01:18,340
Oh, shit!

437
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:20,340
Oh, shit!

438
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:21,960
Oh, shit!

439
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:28,000
Oh, shit!

440
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,099
Fuck, fuck...

441
01:01:31,099 --> 01:01:32,340
Oh!

442
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:35,340
Get him, get him, get him!

443
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:36,340
We're fine!

444
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:40,900
Somebody shoot that thing.

445
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:41,900
Why can I not ram this guy?

446
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:44,219
Wait, wait, wait, to the left!

447
01:01:44,219 --> 01:01:52,000
To the left, to the left!

448
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,099
Alright, somebody just climb up on his boat and snap his neck.

449
01:01:55,099 --> 01:01:56,099
It's not gonna be hard.

450
01:01:56,099 --> 01:01:57,099
We don't have to shoot anything.

451
01:01:57,099 --> 01:02:10,429
Wait.

452
01:02:10,429 --> 01:02:11,429
Money.

453
01:02:11,429 --> 01:02:12,429
Oh, this is bad.

454
01:02:12,429 --> 01:02:13,429
Alright, I gotta pick this stuff up.

455
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:14,429
I gotta heal.

456
01:02:14,429 --> 01:02:15,429
Look at him, almost dead.

457
01:02:15,429 --> 01:02:16,269
I gotta pick this stuff up.

458
01:02:16,269 --> 01:02:17,110
I gotta heal.

459
01:02:17,110 --> 01:02:19,079
Look at him, I'm almost dead.

460
01:02:19,079 --> 01:02:24,070
This game's fun.

461
01:02:24,070 --> 01:02:34,000
Pick up the heal.

462
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,320
Right, straight ahead.

463
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:37,159
What?

464
01:02:37,159 --> 01:02:38,840
Wait, what, that hurt me?

465
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:41,000
What do you mean that hurt me?

466
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,119
Oh shit, there he is.

467
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:47,269
Oh, wait, slow down.

468
01:02:47,269 --> 01:02:48,269
Turn, turn, turn.

469
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,800
Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it.

470
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:55,789
Ooh!

471
01:02:55,789 --> 01:03:06,059
Ooh!

472
01:03:06,059 --> 01:03:19,079
Fire, let's go.

473
01:03:19,079 --> 01:03:20,159
We gotta go for the big guy right there,

474
01:03:20,159 --> 01:03:31,690
right in the middle.

475
01:03:31,690 --> 01:03:33,289
Oh, sorry about that.

476
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:40,260
Ooh, nice hit.

477
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:53,460
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, get him.

478
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:00,059
Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn,

479
01:04:00,059 --> 01:04:01,460
watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it.

480
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:03,019
Hey, sir, they're literally right there.

481
01:04:03,019 --> 01:04:04,539
You can put that down.

482
01:04:04,539 --> 01:04:06,019
You don't need to look through your kaleidoscope

483
01:04:06,019 --> 01:04:07,179
to see where they are.

484
01:04:16,739 --> 01:04:25,130
Oh shit, bad.

485
01:04:25,130 --> 01:04:27,179
Oh.

486
01:04:27,179 --> 01:04:43,059
Fire, fire!

487
01:04:43,059 --> 01:04:43,900
Turn, that way.

488
01:04:44,860 --> 01:04:46,619
I think I'm doing okay.

489
01:04:46,619 --> 01:04:47,820
It's a telescope.

490
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:49,420
It might as well not be anything,

491
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:51,179
because we can see where they are.

492
01:05:01,710 --> 01:05:03,369
Get him!

493
01:05:03,369 --> 01:05:07,329
Oh, that was not, that was so anti-climactic.

494
01:05:07,329 --> 01:05:08,409
Okay, well, whatever.

495
01:05:13,699 --> 01:05:19,409
Did I shoot my own boat?

496
01:05:19,409 --> 01:05:22,610
Am I shooting our boat?

497
01:05:22,610 --> 01:05:24,250
Nice job.

498
01:05:24,250 --> 01:05:26,179
Excellent job, man.

499
01:05:26,179 --> 01:05:41,289
Turn it.

500
01:05:41,289 --> 01:05:43,030
No!

501
01:05:43,030 --> 01:05:49,429
Only one more, that's it.

502
01:05:49,429 --> 01:05:50,550
Turn, fast.

503
01:05:50,550 --> 01:05:52,510
Ready at full sail, Captain.

504
01:05:52,510 --> 01:05:54,110
No more sails to give.

505
01:05:56,739 --> 01:05:58,980
How have you guys not loaded anymore with double shots?

506
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:00,340
I don't understand.

507
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:02,849
How have you guys not done that?

508
01:06:02,849 --> 01:06:05,570
I feel like a shitty asshole manager.

509
01:06:05,570 --> 01:06:07,369
Armed and ready, Captain.

510
01:06:07,369 --> 01:06:08,690
Now why is, how come you didn't do that?

511
01:06:08,690 --> 01:06:10,530
Why is it not like that?

512
01:06:10,530 --> 01:06:17,980
Those should be loaded, ready to go.

513
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:19,619
Shit, turn, he's gonna shoot us.

514
01:06:25,429 --> 01:06:27,030
All right, here we go.

515
01:06:27,030 --> 01:06:27,869
Line it up.

516
01:06:27,869 --> 01:06:35,130
Fire up!

517
01:06:35,130 --> 01:06:36,130
Yeah!

518
01:06:36,130 --> 01:06:38,969
And we're using that gold anyways.

519
01:06:38,969 --> 01:06:40,670
Nice job.

520
01:06:40,670 --> 01:06:45,170
Nice job.

521
01:06:45,170 --> 01:06:47,889
Captain, Tails, angry.

522
01:06:47,889 --> 01:06:51,769
You know, Tails, cowards make terrible pirates.

523
01:06:51,769 --> 01:06:54,449
So how do I prove that I killed him?

524
01:06:54,449 --> 01:06:56,010
Wait, that's him?

525
01:06:56,010 --> 01:06:57,050
Why is he a dragon?

526
01:06:57,050 --> 01:07:00,079
There's a bastard that attacked my crew.

527
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:02,639
Wait, what is, what kind of boat is that?

528
01:07:02,639 --> 01:07:05,690
I'll make sure you jack-catch.

529
01:07:05,690 --> 01:07:12,349
That's like an old flying machine from like 1800.

530
01:07:12,349 --> 01:07:14,469
No, wait, I need that, it's like a receipt.

531
01:07:15,150 --> 01:07:16,150
I think I need that, that's a receipt, right?

532
01:07:16,150 --> 01:07:20,329
Like I killed him, so.

533
01:07:20,329 --> 01:07:25,349
Do I need that?

534
01:07:25,349 --> 01:07:27,900
I need health.

535
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:34,579
Can we load up some new stuff, please?

536
01:07:34,579 --> 01:07:40,139
I'm kind of scared of this guy.

537
01:07:40,139 --> 01:07:41,380
Should I just go straight on?

538
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:42,539
He's coming straight on.

539
01:07:55,079 --> 01:08:00,449
Let this be our final mission.

540
01:08:00,449 --> 01:08:02,130
Boys, it has been an absolute pleasure

541
01:08:02,130 --> 01:08:05,659
to have served with you all these years.

542
01:08:05,659 --> 01:08:12,489
Boys, it has been!

543
01:08:12,489 --> 01:08:14,360
Fire!

544
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:15,199
Fire!

545
01:08:21,329 --> 01:08:22,250
Hey, what?

546
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:26,979
Oh, we're dead.

547
01:08:26,979 --> 01:08:28,819
Hurry, turn, turn.

548
01:08:30,659 --> 01:08:37,140
There's the bastard.

549
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:40,050
I'll make sure you jack-catch.

550
01:08:40,050 --> 01:08:41,609
Can you do another note?

551
01:08:41,609 --> 01:08:45,340
Here it is.

552
01:08:50,859 --> 01:08:52,590
Yeah!

553
01:08:52,590 --> 01:08:54,390
Wait, throw barrels out.

554
01:08:54,390 --> 01:08:56,890
Where are the barrels?

555
01:08:56,890 --> 01:08:58,609
Oh shit, how do I throw barrels out?

556
01:08:58,609 --> 01:09:03,180
Turn.

557
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:08,069
Keep playing, keep playing, mate, keep playing.

558
01:09:08,069 --> 01:09:11,020
Oh, he's dead.

559
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:12,340
That guy died.

560
01:09:12,340 --> 01:09:13,779
That guy got hit in the head with a cannon

561
01:09:13,779 --> 01:09:15,579
and it just took his head clean off.

562
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:22,260
Here we go.

563
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:34,590
Okay, that sounded like an accordion.

564
01:09:34,590 --> 01:09:37,189
That didn't even sound like a harmonica.

565
01:09:37,189 --> 01:09:38,270
He's just going,

566
01:09:38,270 --> 01:09:42,829
ah-roo, ah-roo, ah-roo, ah-roo, ah-roo.

567
01:09:42,829 --> 01:09:44,029
That's not a harmonica.

568
01:09:44,029 --> 01:09:45,069
Was it an accordion?

569
01:09:46,859 --> 01:09:51,850
What was that?

570
01:09:51,850 --> 01:09:57,220
That's not a harmonica, that's an accordion.

571
01:09:57,220 --> 01:09:58,060
Oh, just block him.

572
01:09:58,060 --> 01:10:03,729
He's gonna crash into the island.

573
01:10:03,729 --> 01:10:05,500
Oh, what are you gonna do now, huh?

574
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:13,930
Where are you gonna go?

575
01:10:13,930 --> 01:10:14,770
Oh shit.

576
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:28,380
Everybody all right?

577
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:29,939
We're good?

578
01:10:29,939 --> 01:10:34,020
We're good, we're good, we're good.

579
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:35,140
No way that hits.

580
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:37,340
You hit a direct hit.

581
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:38,340
You gotta be kidding me, dude.

582
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:39,180
All right.

583
01:10:43,930 --> 01:10:44,770
Damn it.

584
01:10:49,859 --> 01:10:50,699
Shit.

585
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:54,840
Turn, turn it slow.

586
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:56,560
Right here, this is it, right here.

587
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:58,279
Bunch of hits, three, two, one.

588
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:00,560
Good job.

589
01:11:07,510 --> 01:11:08,350
Ooh.

590
01:11:12,529 --> 01:11:13,609
Oh, I don't like how close they're getting.

591
01:11:13,609 --> 01:11:17,869
Turn.

592
01:11:17,869 --> 01:11:18,710
Here they come, here they come.

593
01:11:18,710 --> 01:11:19,550
Ready?

594
01:11:31,210 --> 01:11:32,050
Are they talking to us?

595
01:11:32,050 --> 01:11:34,649
Watch out for that bomb.

596
01:11:34,649 --> 01:11:35,489
Ah.

597
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:39,100
Here we go.

598
01:11:40,699 --> 01:11:42,500
It is an accordion.

599
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:43,819
It's an accordion.

600
01:11:43,819 --> 01:11:45,020
It is an accordion.

601
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:51,260
He was seriously using an accordion.

602
01:11:52,180 --> 01:11:53,220
Oh my God.

603
01:11:53,220 --> 01:11:54,779
I feel so validated right now.

604
01:11:57,819 --> 01:11:59,659
Nobody thought that was an accordion.

605
01:12:00,539 --> 01:12:01,380
God damn it.

606
01:12:01,380 --> 01:12:02,579
Why do they have such good shots?

607
01:12:02,579 --> 01:12:03,420
Come on.

608
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:06,090
Holy shit.

609
01:12:09,710 --> 01:12:11,369
Hit the brake, hit the brake.

610
01:12:11,369 --> 01:12:12,210
He won't.

611
01:12:15,090 --> 01:12:16,890
I've never flown a ship before.

612
01:12:16,890 --> 01:12:18,810
I don't know how to actually do this.

613
01:12:18,810 --> 01:12:19,649
Faster.

614
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:29,640
Fuck.

615
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:30,479
Oh my God.

616
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:31,319
Yes.

617
01:12:39,659 --> 01:12:40,500
Got him.

618
01:12:44,659 --> 01:12:45,699
Hell yeah.

619
01:12:45,699 --> 01:12:46,539
That was intense.

620
01:12:46,539 --> 01:12:47,380
That was fun.

621
01:12:51,279 --> 01:12:52,199
All right, got no more money.

622
01:12:52,199 --> 01:12:54,000
Ship's destroyed.

623
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,840
4,400 bucks now.

624
01:12:55,840 --> 01:13:01,210
What can I do with this?

625
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:03,859
Very cool.

626
01:13:03,859 --> 01:13:05,899
Now what?

627
01:13:05,899 --> 01:13:08,090
That was a mission I was on.

628
01:13:08,090 --> 01:13:10,310
Do I have to go get another mission?

629
01:13:10,350 --> 01:13:12,850
Upgrade the ship?

630
01:13:12,850 --> 01:13:20,699
This is fucking fun.

631
01:13:20,699 --> 01:13:21,539
Okay.

632
01:13:21,539 --> 01:13:22,380
Cannons, yeah.

633
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:25,180
Pick up raft for power up, yep.

634
01:13:25,180 --> 01:13:27,180
Move up and down or zoom in and out, yep.

635
01:13:28,979 --> 01:13:33,260
Wait, no, we're still here.

636
01:13:33,260 --> 01:13:35,289
What is this?

637
01:13:35,289 --> 01:13:37,930
If I wanna collect the bounty on Tails' head,

638
01:13:37,930 --> 01:13:40,170
I gotta report back at the mission board.

639
01:13:40,170 --> 01:13:41,569
I just gotta ring the left bell

640
01:13:41,569 --> 01:13:44,130
until I come to a complete stop near the shack.

641
01:13:44,130 --> 01:13:44,970
Here?

642
01:13:44,970 --> 01:13:46,689
Then I'll let them know to open up shop.

643
01:13:46,689 --> 01:13:47,770
Okay.

644
01:13:47,770 --> 01:13:48,609
We gotta go left.

645
01:13:50,819 --> 01:13:52,180
We gotta go back that way.

646
01:13:52,180 --> 01:13:55,149
We actually have to traverse.

647
01:13:55,149 --> 01:13:59,720
Harpy's landing, right?

648
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:01,649
Right here.

649
01:14:01,649 --> 01:14:04,939
Wait, no, what the hell is this place?

650
01:14:09,529 --> 01:14:10,369
Is this, can I go here?

651
01:14:10,369 --> 01:14:11,210
Is this town?

652
01:14:12,970 --> 01:14:15,300
Am I allowed here?

653
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:16,739
I think I'm going too fast.

654
01:14:23,279 --> 01:14:24,359
All right.

655
01:14:24,359 --> 01:14:25,199
Can I come out?

656
01:14:28,390 --> 01:14:31,760
Is this where I need to be?

657
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:32,600
Other side.

658
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:33,420
Shit.

659
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:34,260
How do I reverse?

660
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:40,560
Unfurling sails to half.

661
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,659
Why is there no reverse?

662
01:14:42,659 --> 01:14:50,949
This should be.

663
01:14:50,949 --> 01:14:52,659
Oh my God.

664
01:14:52,659 --> 01:14:54,220
Am I in trouble?

665
01:14:54,220 --> 01:15:13,270
I think, am I actually in trouble for doing that?

666
01:15:13,270 --> 01:15:14,109
All right.

667
01:15:14,109 --> 01:15:19,140
Slow down.

668
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:20,659
I need to park this thing here.

669
01:15:20,659 --> 01:15:26,010
All right, come on.

670
01:15:26,010 --> 01:15:28,649
Looks like an arms dealer has set up shop here.

671
01:15:28,649 --> 01:15:29,489
Oh, look at this.

672
01:15:29,489 --> 01:15:30,850
I just gotta pull the second cord from the left

673
01:15:30,850 --> 01:15:33,250
to start packing some real firepower.

674
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:37,250
What can I get for a million and a half dollars worth of gold?

675
01:15:38,939 --> 01:15:41,340
28, 180?

676
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:43,899
I don't think I would want to bring this up here.

677
01:15:43,899 --> 01:15:44,739
Like, you know.

678
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:51,600
So I've got, I've got like $40 million worth of gold

679
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:53,479
and I've noticed you've got a handgun back there.

680
01:15:53,479 --> 01:15:54,319
Wow.

681
01:15:54,319 --> 01:15:56,520
I wonder if you're going to use that on anybody.

682
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:58,720
Yeah, I mean, I'm just here, just me.

683
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:02,479
Crew is on the boat back there, but you've got a clean shot.

684
01:16:02,479 --> 01:16:04,920
All right, what do we do?

685
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:10,819
How do I upgrade?

686
01:16:10,819 --> 01:16:14,569
Hey boys.

687
01:16:14,569 --> 01:16:17,520
What do you think I should buy?

688
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:18,720
See how much I care about money?

689
01:16:20,890 --> 01:16:22,289
I don't even care.

690
01:16:22,289 --> 01:16:23,850
It's not about how much gold you have.

691
01:16:23,850 --> 01:16:25,409
It's about sending a message.

692
01:16:33,489 --> 01:16:35,770
All right, does this guy like jump on top of me

693
01:16:35,770 --> 01:16:45,649
and tackle me into the water?

694
01:16:45,649 --> 01:16:47,850
What can I buy?

695
01:16:47,850 --> 01:16:48,689
Ooh, what's this?

696
01:16:48,689 --> 01:16:49,529
Harpies landing.

697
01:16:49,529 --> 01:16:50,369
You got it.

698
01:16:50,369 --> 01:16:52,010
All right, I want to buy stuff.

699
01:16:52,010 --> 01:16:53,390
What's this?

700
01:16:53,390 --> 01:16:57,789
Wait, what do I do?

701
01:16:57,789 --> 01:16:59,550
No, come back, come back, come back, come back.

702
01:16:59,550 --> 01:17:01,029
I thought this, oh.

703
01:17:01,029 --> 01:17:04,380
Come to me, shop.

704
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:05,939
Have a look at me wares.

705
01:17:05,939 --> 01:17:07,819
You can put whatever you wish to buy

706
01:17:07,819 --> 01:17:09,180
in the chest over here.

707
01:17:09,859 --> 01:17:10,699
Actually.

708
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,010
Okay, a thousand of these.

709
01:17:20,329 --> 01:17:21,170
I would like.

710
01:17:27,369 --> 01:17:29,930
Is this like the last hole of the mini golf course?

711
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:38,079
Where the ball just disappears.

712
01:17:38,079 --> 01:17:39,239
Which by the way, when I was a kid,

713
01:17:39,239 --> 01:17:41,340
that always freaked me out.

714
01:17:41,340 --> 01:17:44,199
Cause you go, where do those balls go?

715
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:46,600
There's some secret weird underground facility

716
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:48,800
where those balls go at the end of the mini golf course.

717
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:57,079
Where do they go?

718
01:17:57,079 --> 01:17:57,920
Into a bucket.

719
01:17:57,920 --> 01:17:59,880
But like, how?

720
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:01,520
Does somebody have to like climb down a ladder

721
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:04,319
into like a mine shaft and get those balls?

722
01:18:04,319 --> 01:18:10,529
Where do they go?

723
01:18:10,529 --> 01:18:11,369
Yes, they do.

724
01:18:11,369 --> 01:18:17,029
There's a big bucket under there.

725
01:18:17,029 --> 01:18:17,909
Okay, what am I buying?

726
01:18:17,909 --> 01:18:21,520
Oh, I want, that's 10 of these please.

727
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:23,939
I would like 20 of these.

728
01:18:23,939 --> 01:18:26,100
Cause my crew is, they're idiots

729
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:28,859
and they don't know how to load it themselves.

730
01:18:28,859 --> 01:18:30,140
Okay, that's 3000.

731
01:18:32,819 --> 01:18:35,460
I want a bunch of these.

732
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:36,579
I'm going to do one more mission

733
01:18:36,579 --> 01:18:42,039
cause I think this game is actually really fun.

734
01:18:42,039 --> 01:18:43,479
Look, can you just bring up five?

735
01:18:43,479 --> 01:18:46,399
I don't, why do I have to do individual pieces?

736
01:18:46,399 --> 01:18:48,220
Here.

737
01:18:48,220 --> 01:18:51,239
Solid.

738
01:18:51,239 --> 01:18:53,399
Sir, that's just dehydrated dog poop.

739
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:56,960
Oi, run lads.

740
01:18:58,479 --> 01:19:05,659
All right, so what is this?

741
01:19:05,659 --> 01:19:06,939
Buy the goat?

742
01:19:06,939 --> 01:19:18,579
Cool.

743
01:19:18,579 --> 01:19:19,420
Oh, I want some of these too.

744
01:19:19,420 --> 01:19:21,810
Hey, it's the best of quality.

745
01:19:21,810 --> 01:19:24,250
The pirate is paying for supplies.

746
01:19:26,829 --> 01:19:32,100
Yeah, this guy would have been dead an hour ago.

747
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:38,670
Oh no, my gold.

748
01:19:38,670 --> 01:19:42,750
Should I, okay, hold on.

749
01:19:42,750 --> 01:19:45,720
Is there upgrades for the boat?

750
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:47,520
Oh no, they're, okay, well.

751
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,520
I love the smell of an ocean breeze.

752
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:50,359
So what do I got?

753
01:19:50,359 --> 01:19:51,600
The ships sailing around these waters

754
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:54,079
were my old business. 60, 60.

755
01:19:54,079 --> 01:19:54,920
Nice.

756
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:55,760
I'm looking for a fight

757
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:56,840
or to collect some extra booty.

758
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:57,680
Single shot, armed and ready captain.

759
01:19:57,680 --> 01:20:00,199
I might consider taking some of them down.

760
01:20:00,199 --> 01:20:02,399
Where's the lion thing that I bought?

761
01:20:04,069 --> 01:20:05,149
Check the far left.

762
01:20:05,149 --> 01:20:07,789
If I need a better view of my surroundings,

763
01:20:07,789 --> 01:20:09,750
I can always use the magnifying glass

764
01:20:09,750 --> 01:20:12,670
near the bottom corner of the map to zoom in or out.

765
01:20:12,670 --> 01:20:13,949
All right, I gotta go to Harpy's Landing.

766
01:20:13,949 --> 01:20:15,989
That's the mission, right?

767
01:20:15,989 --> 01:20:16,829
We gotta go this way.

768
01:20:16,829 --> 01:20:18,310
All right, let's just, let's show off.

769
01:20:18,310 --> 01:20:19,989
Times 20, what is that?

770
01:20:21,619 --> 01:20:23,460
Letting out sails to half.

771
01:20:24,739 --> 01:20:29,479
What am I looking at here?

772
01:20:29,479 --> 01:20:31,119
Ring the bell three times without letting go.

773
01:20:31,119 --> 01:20:34,840
Letting out sails to half.

774
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:37,600
What am I doing up here?

775
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,600
Oh my God, I just used one.

776
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:42,369
Okay, that's what that does.

777
01:20:42,369 --> 01:20:46,189
Why would I be like up there?

778
01:20:46,189 --> 01:20:47,149
Okay, let's keep going.

779
01:20:47,149 --> 01:20:50,229
We gotta go to this Harpy's Landing.

780
01:20:50,229 --> 01:20:51,189
Gonna bang a right.

781
01:20:54,449 --> 01:21:04,840
But you know I'm gonna have to do that to somebody, right?

782
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:06,279
Walk the deck?

783
01:21:06,279 --> 01:21:10,319
I don't think I can leave this post here.

784
01:21:10,319 --> 01:21:13,260
All right, we're gonna thread the needle right there,

785
01:21:13,260 --> 01:21:15,060
which will take us, we go straight through there

786
01:21:15,060 --> 01:21:18,279
all the way to Harpy's Landing.

787
01:21:18,279 --> 01:21:19,119
Let's open it up.

788
01:21:19,119 --> 01:21:20,079
Go full speed.

789
01:21:24,659 --> 01:21:25,939
Were we already at full speed?

790
01:21:25,939 --> 01:21:30,779
These things didn't go very fast, huh?

791
01:21:30,779 --> 01:21:32,899
How do you make a ship go faster?

792
01:21:32,899 --> 01:21:35,939
And is it possible to have a ship go too fast

793
01:21:35,939 --> 01:21:39,210
where we're going like one to 200 miles per hour?

794
01:21:39,210 --> 01:21:42,289
Okay, if they were like 80 mile per hour gusts at sea

795
01:21:42,289 --> 01:21:44,130
and we had like 30 of those lined up,

796
01:21:44,130 --> 01:21:46,170
would we be going 200 miles per hour,

797
01:21:46,170 --> 01:21:48,369
like holding onto the edges screaming

798
01:21:48,369 --> 01:21:49,970
because our legs are in the air flying up?

799
01:21:49,970 --> 01:21:50,890
What would happen?

800
01:21:53,989 --> 01:22:00,710
All right, we got somebody right here.

801
01:22:00,710 --> 01:22:02,310
Put it in drive.

802
01:22:02,310 --> 01:22:03,789
All right, we're ready, let's go.

803
01:22:03,829 --> 01:22:08,840
Should I try this?

804
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:12,619
All right, let's ram this guy.

805
01:22:12,619 --> 01:22:15,140
Why is the music just still playing like this?

806
01:22:15,140 --> 01:22:16,579
Here we go, one, two, three.

807
01:22:22,899 --> 01:22:24,640
Got him.

808
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:35,640
Got him.

809
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:41,850
We got 70 binoculars, what are those?

810
01:22:41,850 --> 01:22:43,770
Oh wait, which way are we going?

811
01:22:43,770 --> 01:22:49,130
Turn around, turn around, going the wrong way.

812
01:22:49,130 --> 01:23:01,180
We're gonna go that way.

813
01:23:01,180 --> 01:23:08,979
Well, that was a runtime error.

814
01:23:11,109 --> 01:23:14,550
Okay, well, we're moving on to the next one.

815
01:23:14,550 --> 01:23:15,789
Damn it, that was kind of fun too.

816
01:23:15,789 --> 01:23:27,800
All right, we gotta move on anyways.

817
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:29,880
All right, coming up next, we're gonna do,

818
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:31,640
I expect you to die, I'm so mad.

819
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:32,479
I really wanted to play that.

820
01:23:32,479 --> 01:23:36,329
We're gonna do Cooking Simulator VR.

821
01:23:36,329 --> 01:23:44,439
See how this is.

822
01:23:44,439 --> 01:23:45,600
Not enough ram.

823
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:48,880
Is it a tuber game?

824
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:55,189
Well, I played this game a lot a few years ago, come on.

825
01:23:55,189 --> 01:24:06,029
Give me some credit here.

826
01:24:06,029 --> 01:24:07,310
I expect you to die is really good.

827
01:24:07,310 --> 01:24:08,909
Maybe I'm gonna reload it.

828
01:24:10,909 --> 01:24:18,460
It's very loud, make sure I can see you guys.

829
01:24:21,930 --> 01:24:23,609
This is way too loud for me.

830
01:24:23,609 --> 01:24:24,970
I gotta turn this way down.

831
01:24:26,289 --> 01:24:33,319
It's much better.

832
01:24:50,189 --> 01:24:51,850
Louder?

833
01:24:51,850 --> 01:24:54,829
Not louder, why?

834
01:24:54,829 --> 01:25:01,359
Home Depot, what was that laugh?

835
01:25:01,359 --> 01:25:02,520
Oh, Home Depot.

836
01:25:09,439 --> 01:25:13,130
This is kind of ugly.

837
01:25:13,130 --> 01:25:15,729
All right, settings, settings, where are we?

838
01:25:17,470 --> 01:25:18,310
Where are you?

839
01:25:18,310 --> 01:25:20,500
There you are.

840
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:27,449
Okay, let's do settings, settings.

841
01:25:27,449 --> 01:25:30,130
Graphics, put them on high.

842
01:25:30,130 --> 01:25:31,970
Color grading, bloom, turn that off.

843
01:25:31,970 --> 01:25:33,529
Who wants to have bloom ever?

844
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:43,039
Yeah, I guess it's staying on.

845
01:25:43,039 --> 01:25:48,010
Oh, movement smooth, rotation smooth.

846
01:25:48,010 --> 01:25:50,279
Head position offset.

847
01:25:50,279 --> 01:25:53,909
Remote grab, sprinkles by shake.

848
01:25:53,909 --> 01:25:56,149
Okay, turn this fucking music off.

849
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:08,229
Hands position, I think that's fine.

850
01:26:08,229 --> 01:26:14,039
Input, grab, use blender.

851
01:26:14,039 --> 01:26:18,039
Okay, so it's like grab, grab, grab is grab.

852
01:26:18,039 --> 01:26:22,239
Use blender is, crouch is A.

853
01:26:22,279 --> 01:26:23,399
Why would you need to tip toe?

854
01:26:23,399 --> 01:26:29,479
Double click A, pause menu is, what the fuck?

855
01:26:29,479 --> 01:26:32,430
Okay, now hold on, what the hell is that?

856
01:26:34,779 --> 01:26:37,300
These two at the same time, okay.

857
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:40,859
Remote grab, hold this and press that.

858
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:49,069
I'm ready, I'm ready.

859
01:26:54,189 --> 01:26:59,119
I can't, okay, I don't know how to play it in VR though.

860
01:26:59,119 --> 01:27:02,010
Let's get, let's do the tutorial.

861
01:27:02,010 --> 01:27:05,079
The game's gonna crash if you don't put it in low.

862
01:27:05,079 --> 01:27:07,250
I got a 3090.

863
01:27:07,250 --> 01:27:16,670
It just heats up VR games until they crash.

864
01:27:16,670 --> 01:27:19,260
What did he say, fuck condoms?

865
01:27:19,260 --> 01:27:21,699
What are you trying, what are you doing?

866
01:27:21,699 --> 01:27:25,340
What, fuck condoms, dude, oh, I hate those.

867
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:26,680
What?

868
01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:28,199
All right, here we go, pause.

869
01:27:29,479 --> 01:27:34,689
What?

870
01:27:34,689 --> 01:27:35,569
Okay, using a knife,

871
01:27:35,569 --> 01:27:37,529
most products can be sliced into smaller pieces.

872
01:27:37,529 --> 01:27:49,170
Grab a knife, cut four slices of bread.

873
01:27:49,170 --> 01:27:50,130
Is that four?

874
01:27:50,130 --> 01:27:53,199
Whoa, this is cool.

875
01:27:53,199 --> 01:28:02,239
Okay, I got four slices of bread, put them on a plate.

876
01:28:02,239 --> 01:28:04,180
Nice, oh, this is gonna be fun, I love this.

877
01:28:04,180 --> 01:28:05,989
We're gonna be here for a while.

878
01:28:05,989 --> 01:28:09,210
You finished the tutorial.

879
01:28:09,210 --> 01:28:11,109
Very cool, very, very cool.

880
01:28:11,109 --> 01:28:15,729
Oh my God, this is great, I can't wait to play this.

881
01:28:15,729 --> 01:28:19,050
Remote grabbing, press trigger and point your hand

882
01:28:19,050 --> 01:28:24,659
and then grab and go like that.

883
01:28:24,659 --> 01:28:29,220
Nice, okay, turn on the grill.

884
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:35,260
Turn over the steaks using the, I don't have to do that.

885
01:28:35,260 --> 01:28:45,100
Wait until the steaks are ready.

886
01:28:45,100 --> 01:28:51,239
Holy shit, this is fun, this is actually really good.

887
01:28:51,239 --> 01:28:52,619
Okay, that's cool.

888
01:28:55,439 --> 01:29:01,750
No, you're gonna press all the juices out, don't touch it.

889
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:03,510
I can't wait, okay, cool.

890
01:29:03,510 --> 01:29:05,819
What do we do with this?

891
01:29:05,819 --> 01:29:07,220
Seasoning, there are three types of seasoning,

892
01:29:07,220 --> 01:29:09,579
liquid, herb, dry, yeah, let's try to add some flavor.

893
01:29:09,579 --> 01:29:13,939
Use five kilograms of salt, three kilograms of thyme,

894
01:29:13,939 --> 01:29:15,460
okay, five kilograms of salt,

895
01:29:15,460 --> 01:29:21,960
this is salt right here, right?

896
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:25,430
Oops, that's a lot, minus, wait, what?

897
01:29:25,430 --> 01:29:28,229
Oh, cool, okay, how much do you need salt

898
01:29:28,229 --> 01:29:30,949
and then three of thyme, this is thyme right here, right?

899
01:29:30,949 --> 01:29:35,340
I don't know, why is it not listed?

900
01:29:35,340 --> 01:29:42,569
How come it's not listed on here?

901
01:29:42,569 --> 01:29:48,189
Okay, three of cilantro, 10 of clarified butter.

902
01:29:49,210 --> 01:29:53,329
Is this clarified butter?

903
01:29:53,329 --> 01:29:58,460
Oops, oh, 10 milliliters.

904
01:29:58,460 --> 01:30:02,039
Dude, this is actually really fun, I can't wait.

905
01:30:02,039 --> 01:30:12,899
Okay, oh, that's the wrong thing.

906
01:30:12,899 --> 01:30:17,319
I get it, I know how it works.

907
01:30:17,319 --> 01:30:20,279
Liquids shedding, you can pour liquids into the containers

908
01:30:20,279 --> 01:30:21,479
in order to prepare a special mixture.

909
01:30:21,479 --> 01:30:24,720
Try the recipe, take a bottle of honey or olive oil.

910
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:30,470
Okay, bottle of honey, okay.

911
01:30:30,510 --> 01:30:43,159
Add 100 milliliters or 300, okay, that's fine, well done.

912
01:30:43,159 --> 01:30:48,130
100, okay, that's fine.

913
01:30:48,130 --> 01:30:58,439
Turn on the tap, add water, how much do I need to 200?

914
01:30:58,439 --> 01:31:01,779
All right, cool.

915
01:31:01,779 --> 01:31:02,979
In order to taste the mixture,

916
01:31:02,979 --> 01:31:13,479
put your open hand in the pot and move it to your mouth?

917
01:31:13,479 --> 01:31:16,510
What?

918
01:31:16,510 --> 01:31:19,970
It's 50% honey, 20% water, 18% olive oil.

919
01:31:19,970 --> 01:31:23,060
How would I know that?

920
01:31:23,060 --> 01:31:31,189
Okay, fixing stuff, right?

921
01:31:31,189 --> 01:31:34,329
Take phone, choose repair company.

922
01:31:34,329 --> 01:31:41,819
All right, grab the phone, select, what am I doing?

923
01:31:41,819 --> 01:31:43,529
Wait, what did I do?

924
01:31:43,529 --> 01:31:45,090
Choose repair company, thumb stick, okay.

925
01:31:45,090 --> 01:31:47,800
Wait until the repair is over, all right, cool.

926
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:51,909
Repair is happening, beautiful, perfect.

927
01:31:51,909 --> 01:31:56,569
You got it, there's the fries.

928
01:31:56,569 --> 01:32:01,689
I'm pretty much ready to go, cool.

929
01:32:01,689 --> 01:32:03,250
Oh, there's like a coffee maker too in this one.

930
01:32:03,250 --> 01:32:07,149
There's a new coffee maker?

931
01:32:07,149 --> 01:32:11,000
No, don't do that, what's this?

932
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:14,920
PC and mouse, is your personal computer here?

933
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:17,659
You can manage your work in your kitchen.

934
01:32:17,659 --> 01:32:22,979
Wait, I actually have to grab the mouse?

935
01:32:22,979 --> 01:32:26,439
Oh, this is next level here.

936
01:32:26,439 --> 01:32:30,239
Navigation bar, get through every tab.

937
01:32:30,239 --> 01:32:39,300
All right, restaurant info, manage recipes, yep.

938
01:32:39,300 --> 01:32:45,359
Every available dish, okay.

939
01:32:45,359 --> 01:32:50,100
Perks can do it, skill points, yep.

940
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:55,060
And decorations, that's actually really intuitive.

941
01:32:55,060 --> 01:32:57,220
All right, I think I'm ready to get started here

942
01:32:57,220 --> 01:32:58,810
in a minute here.

943
01:32:58,810 --> 01:33:02,550
Tablets, okay, the tablet, right, you order food here.

944
01:33:02,550 --> 01:33:06,890
Tap the trigger to continue, yep.

945
01:33:06,890 --> 01:33:09,659
Sorting buttons, very cool.

946
01:33:09,659 --> 01:33:12,979
Find anything you're looking for.

947
01:33:12,979 --> 01:33:14,380
In main sec, there's a list of items to buy.

948
01:33:14,380 --> 01:33:17,159
Tap trigger, cool, yep.

949
01:33:17,159 --> 01:33:28,399
Buy a small pot, small pot, small pot.

950
01:33:28,399 --> 01:33:30,810
Very nice, how much is that?

951
01:33:30,810 --> 01:33:39,409
Okay, spawn, good job, wait, that spawned in my hand?

952
01:33:39,409 --> 01:33:43,399
Okay, I got the pot now, nice.

953
01:33:43,399 --> 01:33:52,500
All right, let's keep going, oh well.

954
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:54,500
All right, now I, yeah, at this part,

955
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:55,659
you actually have to pick everything up,

956
01:33:55,659 --> 01:33:58,130
put the bread and stuff in there, you got it.

957
01:33:58,130 --> 01:34:02,619
Take a plate from the stack, okay, got it.

958
01:34:02,619 --> 01:34:06,600
Put one potato and one onion on the plate.

959
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:10,300
I actually don't know which is which.

960
01:34:10,300 --> 01:34:11,460
Where's an onion?

961
01:34:11,460 --> 01:34:12,279
Is this an onion?

962
01:34:12,279 --> 01:34:15,520
This is technically an onion, right?

963
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:21,600
Put one salmon on the plate.

964
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:27,060
Oh shit, okay, where's the salmon?

965
01:34:27,060 --> 01:34:35,739
Oh shit, all right, cool.

966
01:34:35,739 --> 01:34:40,250
All right, these are almost done.

967
01:34:40,250 --> 01:34:50,699
Close the fridge, close the fridge.

968
01:34:50,699 --> 01:34:55,340
Okay, I think I'm ready to go.

969
01:34:55,340 --> 01:34:57,300
Let's get started here.

970
01:34:57,300 --> 01:35:02,579
How do I start the day?

971
01:35:02,579 --> 01:35:04,619
I did that, I did that, is there, I think there's a,

972
01:35:04,619 --> 01:35:06,460
nope, wait, is there something else I need to do?

973
01:35:06,460 --> 01:35:07,739
What's this one?

974
01:35:07,739 --> 01:35:10,109
Oh shit, I have to do this, okay, hold on.

975
01:35:10,109 --> 01:35:17,060
All right, so I need, so this is a trout, salt.

976
01:35:17,060 --> 01:35:21,529
Okay, three cilantro leaves.

977
01:35:21,529 --> 01:35:22,569
This is cilantro, how much?

978
01:35:22,569 --> 01:35:29,850
Three time, that's wrong, okay.

979
01:35:35,550 --> 01:35:45,210
Clarified butter, 10 milliliters.

980
01:35:45,210 --> 01:35:48,520
All right, that's fine.

981
01:35:48,520 --> 01:35:49,359
Why is that not right?

982
01:35:49,359 --> 01:35:55,220
Do I have to get it exact?

983
01:35:55,220 --> 01:36:04,130
Getting it exact is hard in VR.

984
01:36:04,130 --> 01:36:17,039
10, salt, five, okay.

985
01:36:20,979 --> 01:36:27,939
Free of time, okay, that's gonna be so hard to get exact.

986
01:36:27,939 --> 01:36:32,659
It really is.

987
01:36:32,659 --> 01:36:35,060
I did it five times, one, two, three, four, five.

988
01:36:35,060 --> 01:36:37,579
One, two, three, four, five.

989
01:36:37,579 --> 01:36:40,180
I don't, I shook it five times.

990
01:36:40,180 --> 01:36:44,060
Oh fuck you game, what the fuck, oh my God.

991
01:36:44,060 --> 01:36:46,739
One, two, three, four, five.

992
01:36:46,739 --> 01:37:01,329
You saw me do it five times, duh!

993
01:37:01,329 --> 01:37:09,220
Wait, it doesn't care.

994
01:37:09,220 --> 01:37:21,619
Five, cilantro, and then sunflower oil, 15.

995
01:37:21,619 --> 01:37:22,939
Got it, all right, all right, all right, all right,

996
01:37:22,939 --> 01:37:38,680
all right, here we go.

997
01:37:44,979 --> 01:37:54,779
How do I start up the game?

998
01:37:54,779 --> 01:37:57,859
Okay, here we go, career mode.

999
01:37:57,859 --> 01:38:04,140
What do you got, what should I do?

1000
01:38:04,140 --> 01:38:08,619
Sandbox or just do career mode?

1001
01:38:08,619 --> 01:38:14,300
Career, sandbox, career, career, career.

1002
01:38:14,300 --> 01:38:15,779
Sandbox career.

1003
01:38:15,779 --> 01:38:28,409
All right, we'll do career, why not?

1004
01:38:28,409 --> 01:38:30,890
63 meters between, I don't even know what that means.

1005
01:38:30,890 --> 01:38:41,000
Just pops up sometimes, let's go.

1006
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:42,560
All right, here we go, within an hour,

1007
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:43,399
we'll be open for business,

1008
01:38:43,399 --> 01:38:47,329
use the time to get ready for work.

1009
01:38:47,329 --> 01:38:54,069
What do we have for food here?

1010
01:38:54,069 --> 01:38:55,550
All right, what are my recipes?

1011
01:38:55,550 --> 01:39:04,010
I don't even know, I gotta go to the computer.

1012
01:39:04,010 --> 01:39:08,699
Okay, I've got baked trout, tomato soup,

1013
01:39:08,699 --> 01:39:11,529
salmon steak, and boiled potatoes.

1014
01:39:11,529 --> 01:39:15,180
Okay, so I need to get trout, what does this have?

1015
01:39:15,180 --> 01:39:22,020
This is black pepper, black pepper thyme and dried dill.

1016
01:39:23,229 --> 01:39:26,649
Black pepper thyme, dill, horseradish, all right.

1017
01:39:26,649 --> 01:39:29,010
Okay, black pepper, thyme, dill, horseradish.

1018
01:39:36,439 --> 01:39:39,739
Okay, I gotta get these ready.

1019
01:39:41,659 --> 01:39:44,409
Okay, black pepper, thyme, what do I buy?

1020
01:39:44,409 --> 01:39:46,920
Okay, I think I have to buy that at the menu.

1021
01:39:46,920 --> 01:39:49,279
Oh, here we go, black pepper,

1022
01:39:49,279 --> 01:39:56,689
I'm gonna need black pepper, salt.

1023
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:00,520
Just get it all over there.

1024
01:40:00,520 --> 01:40:03,539
I gotta have a seasoning area.

1025
01:40:03,539 --> 01:40:04,380
All right, we're gonna go,

1026
01:40:04,380 --> 01:40:06,250
seasoning area's gonna be right here.

1027
01:40:06,250 --> 01:40:11,949
Line it up alphabetically.

1028
01:40:11,949 --> 01:40:17,840
Salt, pepper, dandelion, I don't even know what that is.

1029
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:21,220
I have no idea.

1030
01:40:21,220 --> 01:40:22,060
What are these?

1031
01:40:22,060 --> 01:40:26,640
That's horseradish and peppercorns.

1032
01:40:26,640 --> 01:40:29,899
I think I'm pretty much ready.

1033
01:40:29,899 --> 01:40:30,739
Should I do it?

1034
01:40:30,739 --> 01:40:33,729
Okay, probably by use.

1035
01:40:33,729 --> 01:40:34,930
That's time I know what that is,

1036
01:40:34,930 --> 01:40:36,789
I don't know what anything else is.

1037
01:40:36,789 --> 01:40:41,729
I need a bunch of food, right, I need trout.

1038
01:40:41,729 --> 01:40:47,579
What have we got?

1039
01:40:47,579 --> 01:40:50,100
Stay open.

1040
01:40:50,100 --> 01:40:52,260
Dude, what is with this door?

1041
01:40:52,260 --> 01:40:59,420
Stay open.

1042
01:40:59,420 --> 01:41:02,989
Where am I?

1043
01:41:02,989 --> 01:41:11,329
I need salmon too.

1044
01:41:11,329 --> 01:41:18,090
Can I hold more than one thing?

1045
01:41:18,090 --> 01:41:20,409
I think I'm almost ready, I need oil as well.

1046
01:41:20,409 --> 01:41:25,170
Yeah, plate.

1047
01:41:25,170 --> 01:41:28,579
Okay, I'm almost ready.

1048
01:41:28,579 --> 01:41:31,369
Let's go.

1049
01:41:31,369 --> 01:41:36,390
First order, tomato soup.

1050
01:41:36,390 --> 01:41:42,850
I don't even know how to make tomato soup.

1051
01:41:42,850 --> 01:41:45,810
Chicken broth, salt, black pepper, what do I do with it?

1052
01:41:45,810 --> 01:41:53,979
Boil for 60 seconds, do I even have a pot?

1053
01:41:53,979 --> 01:42:03,109
Okay, pot, chicken broth, 700 milliliters.

1054
01:42:03,109 --> 01:42:10,720
Okay, chicken broth, get it, 700.

1055
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:13,600
Whoa, okay, it's gonna be a little salty.

1056
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:17,579
Chicken broth, salt, black, god, this is too far away.

1057
01:42:17,579 --> 01:42:28,869
Salt, black pepper, both 12.

1058
01:42:28,869 --> 01:42:36,300
Got it, okay, stay up.

1059
01:42:36,300 --> 01:42:40,880
Okay, cayenne pepper, six tomatoes.

1060
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:50,579
Cayenne pepper, okay, is this boiling?

1061
01:42:50,579 --> 01:42:53,359
Oh shit, I need tomatoes, ow, my hands.

1062
01:42:53,359 --> 01:42:58,229
I need 960 grams of tomatoes.

1063
01:42:58,229 --> 01:43:00,239
How many grams is this?

1064
01:43:00,239 --> 01:43:07,000
I don't know, how many grams is this?

1065
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:10,250
How can I tell?

1066
01:43:10,250 --> 01:43:14,340
One, two, three, four, five, how many is it?

1067
01:43:14,340 --> 01:43:17,960
How many do I have to do?

1068
01:43:17,960 --> 01:43:20,039
I need to cut them, no I don't.

1069
01:43:20,039 --> 01:43:30,489
You have to, you blend them up, let me see.

1070
01:43:30,489 --> 01:43:33,199
I need way more than that.

1071
01:43:33,199 --> 01:43:42,659
240, that was five.

1072
01:43:42,659 --> 01:43:45,409
How many do I have to put in here?

1073
01:43:45,409 --> 01:43:52,119
Taste it, what's in here?

1074
01:43:52,119 --> 01:43:55,890
That doesn't help me, that's just percentages.

1075
01:43:55,890 --> 01:44:04,529
I need 960 grams.

1076
01:44:04,529 --> 01:44:09,199
Dude, what is in this?

1077
01:44:09,199 --> 01:44:15,869
I need 120 grams of onions.

1078
01:44:15,869 --> 01:44:17,289
Oh shit, it's one.

1079
01:44:17,289 --> 01:44:18,270
Okay, you can actually look at it.

1080
01:44:18,270 --> 01:44:19,109
I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it,

1081
01:44:19,109 --> 01:44:22,579
I know, I know, I know, I know.

1082
01:44:22,579 --> 01:44:31,420
It's literally just one.

1083
01:44:31,420 --> 01:44:32,859
All right, is it cooking?

1084
01:44:32,859 --> 01:44:39,500
How do I cook it?

1085
01:44:39,500 --> 01:44:45,199
Is this even fucking working?

1086
01:44:45,199 --> 01:44:51,920
Add sour cream, okay, add sour cream.

1087
01:44:51,920 --> 01:45:02,369
300 milliliters, are you kidding me?

1088
01:45:02,369 --> 01:45:05,340
This is a lot of sour cream.

1089
01:45:05,340 --> 01:45:14,619
Okay, blend it.

1090
01:45:14,619 --> 01:45:19,029
Is this hot?

1091
01:45:19,029 --> 01:45:22,390
The stove isn't on, yes it is, look.

1092
01:45:22,390 --> 01:45:24,930
I thought that was blood.

1093
01:45:24,930 --> 01:45:29,340
The stove is on.

1094
01:45:29,340 --> 01:45:42,180
Look, how do I know when it's done?

1095
01:45:42,180 --> 01:45:47,300
Okay, I need a bowl.

1096
01:45:47,300 --> 01:45:48,460
No, that's not what I need.

1097
01:45:48,460 --> 01:45:53,920
What do I need, right here.

1098
01:45:53,920 --> 01:46:03,750
Did I even do it?

1099
01:46:03,750 --> 01:46:14,050
This is a little light.

1100
01:46:14,050 --> 01:46:15,699
Did it work?

1101
01:46:15,699 --> 01:46:25,739
Tomato soup, that wasn't bad.

1102
01:46:25,739 --> 01:46:29,180
The temperature was perfect, the technique was all right.

1103
01:46:29,180 --> 01:46:31,579
Flavor was on point, too much sour cream though.

1104
01:46:31,579 --> 01:46:35,550
All right, we're good.

1105
01:46:35,550 --> 01:46:38,149
Trout, all right, trout, 200 grams.

1106
01:46:38,149 --> 01:46:39,909
One trout is 200 grams.

1107
01:46:39,909 --> 01:46:41,470
All right, get this off.

1108
01:46:41,470 --> 01:46:47,859
I need to clean this.

1109
01:46:47,859 --> 01:46:51,550
Trout, where are my trouts?

1110
01:46:51,550 --> 01:46:55,170
How do you cook this?

1111
01:46:55,170 --> 01:46:56,770
Yeah, I need a trout right here.

1112
01:47:00,939 --> 01:47:11,800
Season with, this is black pepper and thyme right here.

1113
01:47:11,800 --> 01:47:20,359
Thyme is five, good, fuck you.

1114
01:47:20,359 --> 01:47:22,640
Dill, five, this is dill, right?

1115
01:47:22,640 --> 01:47:30,710
Yeah, beautiful, not bad.

1116
01:47:30,710 --> 01:47:32,630
Place it on a baking tray and bake for 90 seconds.

1117
01:47:32,630 --> 01:47:36,220
Where's the baking tray?

1118
01:47:36,220 --> 01:47:46,500
Right there.

1119
01:47:46,500 --> 01:47:53,689
All right, let's go.

1120
01:47:53,689 --> 01:47:56,560
90 seconds.

1121
01:47:56,560 --> 01:47:59,399
While that's happening, let's do the lemon 80 grams

1122
01:47:59,399 --> 01:48:01,989
into one lemon into quarters.

1123
01:48:01,989 --> 01:48:19,890
Okay, one lemon into quarters.

1124
01:48:19,890 --> 01:48:25,489
How the fuck do you do this?

1125
01:48:25,489 --> 01:48:29,289
It doesn't matter, that's fine.

1126
01:48:29,289 --> 01:48:32,869
How long has it been?

1127
01:48:32,869 --> 01:48:40,439
Oops, okay, make it look nice.

1128
01:48:40,439 --> 01:48:45,430
And then finish it off with garnish with parsley leaves.

1129
01:48:45,430 --> 01:48:51,760
Six grams.

1130
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:54,600
How much is one of these?

1131
01:48:54,600 --> 01:49:00,039
Okay, so I need one, two, what?

1132
01:49:00,039 --> 01:49:06,010
I have to actually hold them?

1133
01:49:06,010 --> 01:49:26,359
Don't, bingo, serve it up.

1134
01:49:26,359 --> 01:49:27,760
That one's not, I don't think that's bad.

1135
01:49:28,279 --> 01:49:29,750
That's gonna be good, I think.

1136
01:49:29,750 --> 01:49:32,359
What do you think?

1137
01:49:32,359 --> 01:49:35,279
Wash your hands.

1138
01:49:35,279 --> 01:49:39,550
Look at that shit, that was really good.

1139
01:49:39,550 --> 01:49:43,090
Another tomato soup, I still know.

1140
01:49:43,090 --> 01:49:44,649
All right, all right, let me not fuck this up this time.

1141
01:49:44,649 --> 01:49:46,750
Here we go, ready?

1142
01:49:46,750 --> 01:49:48,760
Check this out.

1143
01:49:48,760 --> 01:49:50,880
So it's, how many tomatoes?

1144
01:49:53,880 --> 01:49:56,880
I don't know how many tomatoes I need.

1145
01:49:56,880 --> 01:50:02,329
120 times, so I need one, two, three.

1146
01:50:02,329 --> 01:50:07,569
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, is it eight?

1147
01:50:09,130 --> 01:50:11,199
It'd be eight, right?

1148
01:50:11,199 --> 01:50:14,399
Okay, I need one onion.

1149
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,279
And then we do 700 milliliters of chicken broth.

1150
01:50:17,279 --> 01:50:18,119
Where's the chicken broth?

1151
01:50:18,119 --> 01:50:19,239
I don't have any more left.

1152
01:50:19,239 --> 01:50:22,239
I gotta buy it.

1153
01:50:22,239 --> 01:50:26,439
Hurry, hurry, hurry, chicken broth and sour cream.

1154
01:50:26,439 --> 01:50:37,840
Chicken broth, get it?

1155
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:42,449
Okay, it's open, but it's fine.

1156
01:50:42,449 --> 01:50:47,819
Okay, now I need sour cream.

1157
01:50:47,819 --> 01:50:49,899
And let's get two of those.

1158
01:50:51,890 --> 01:50:53,010
All right, here we go.

1159
01:50:58,220 --> 01:51:04,579
700 milliliters.

1160
01:51:04,579 --> 01:51:06,119
Shit!

1161
01:51:06,119 --> 01:51:10,510
Just calm down.

1162
01:51:10,510 --> 01:51:31,159
Salt, pepper, 12 each, okay?

1163
01:51:31,159 --> 01:51:36,930
Now it's the cayenne pepper and boil it.

1164
01:51:36,930 --> 01:51:45,390
Cayenne pepper, six grams.

1165
01:51:45,390 --> 01:51:49,510
Now we put this on the stove

1166
01:51:49,510 --> 01:51:53,079
and then we add 150 milliliters of sour cream.

1167
01:51:53,079 --> 01:51:54,600
Get it on the stove, let's go.

1168
01:51:54,600 --> 01:52:05,319
Here we go, boil it.

1169
01:52:05,319 --> 01:52:07,399
60 seconds, come on, I can see it turning.

1170
01:52:07,399 --> 01:52:08,640
The colors are getting nice.

1171
01:52:08,640 --> 01:52:09,720
It's all, hey, what do they say?

1172
01:52:09,720 --> 01:52:10,560
What does Chef say?

1173
01:52:10,560 --> 01:52:12,979
It's getting happy.

1174
01:52:12,979 --> 01:52:25,079
How can I tell if it's cooked?

1175
01:52:25,079 --> 01:52:34,960
Okay, add 150 milliliters of sour cream.

1176
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:44,199
Get it, that's too far.

1177
01:52:44,199 --> 01:52:48,140
How much is in there now?

1178
01:52:48,140 --> 01:52:50,659
I don't know how much is in there now.

1179
01:52:50,659 --> 01:52:52,460
I was gonna guess.

1180
01:52:52,460 --> 01:52:55,930
Okay, it's ready.

1181
01:52:55,930 --> 01:52:59,739
Into a bowl, 300 milliliters.

1182
01:52:59,739 --> 01:53:11,159
Here it is, good.

1183
01:53:11,159 --> 01:53:13,729
Bingo, done.

1184
01:53:13,729 --> 01:53:18,939
Sorry, I put a little too much in anyways.

1185
01:53:18,939 --> 01:53:20,779
This looks like water.

1186
01:53:20,779 --> 01:53:23,689
This looks like hot dog water.

1187
01:53:23,689 --> 01:53:25,609
Why does it look so thin and shitty?

1188
01:53:25,609 --> 01:53:28,569
I don't get it.

1189
01:53:28,569 --> 01:53:33,159
Why does it look so thin?

1190
01:53:33,159 --> 01:53:34,039
That's not bad though.

1191
01:53:34,039 --> 01:53:35,359
I got five stars on that one.

1192
01:53:35,359 --> 01:53:36,319
I'm gonna keep that available

1193
01:53:36,319 --> 01:53:42,270
because it's gonna happen again, right?

1194
01:53:42,270 --> 01:53:43,229
I can get a new recipe?

1195
01:53:43,229 --> 01:53:45,550
All right, well, I don't care about that right now.

1196
01:53:45,550 --> 01:53:48,149
Salmon steak and boiled potatoes.

1197
01:53:48,149 --> 01:53:53,539
Salmon, salmon, tuna.

1198
01:53:53,539 --> 01:54:00,399
Wait, does this work?

1199
01:54:00,399 --> 01:54:04,630
Salmon steak, okay.

1200
01:54:04,630 --> 01:54:07,109
Salt and pepper five and add it to the pan.

1201
01:54:07,109 --> 01:54:08,630
Oh shit, I need a pan.

1202
01:54:08,630 --> 01:54:14,199
Do I have a pan?

1203
01:54:14,199 --> 01:54:16,840
That can stay heated, that's fine.

1204
01:54:16,840 --> 01:54:18,199
No, put this in the fridge.

1205
01:54:32,380 --> 01:54:37,960
I need a pan, there we go.

1206
01:54:37,960 --> 01:54:40,270
Okay, get right there.

1207
01:54:40,270 --> 01:54:42,539
Let's go ahead and get the gas on.

1208
01:54:42,539 --> 01:54:44,020
Not bad, not bad.

1209
01:54:44,020 --> 01:54:45,659
Five and five on this guy here.

1210
01:54:45,659 --> 01:54:52,350
Let's go ahead and grab it.

1211
01:54:52,350 --> 01:54:53,630
That's so much easier than running across

1212
01:54:53,630 --> 01:55:00,720
the whole damn level.

1213
01:55:00,720 --> 01:55:09,300
Okay, all right, there it is.

1214
01:55:09,300 --> 01:55:11,220
I need a little bit of oil in the pan.

1215
01:55:11,220 --> 01:55:22,800
Sunflower oil, 10 milliliters, where's my oil?

1216
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:25,989
Don't fall.

1217
01:55:25,989 --> 01:55:30,220
Okay, put the salmon in the oil.

1218
01:55:30,220 --> 01:55:38,739
60 seconds, ooh, timer, start it.

1219
01:55:38,739 --> 01:55:40,100
How do I start the timer?

1220
01:55:40,100 --> 01:55:45,100
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,

1221
01:55:48,859 --> 01:55:53,859
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.

1222
01:55:58,619 --> 01:56:03,619
21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 29, 30, 31, two, 33, 34, 35, six,

1223
01:56:23,920 --> 01:56:27,680
47, 48, 49, 50, this is too long.

1224
01:56:28,600 --> 01:56:36,970
All right, it's done, it's done.

1225
01:56:36,970 --> 01:56:39,289
Two, all right, my potatoes.

1226
01:56:39,289 --> 01:56:41,609
I gotta do my boiled potatoes.

1227
01:56:41,609 --> 01:56:45,649
Add to the pot, one, two, three, water, salt,

1228
01:56:45,649 --> 01:56:50,920
and potatoes, boiled for 100 foot, water, salt, and potatoes.

1229
01:56:50,920 --> 01:56:52,439
Where's my pot?

1230
01:56:52,439 --> 01:56:56,000
It's in the fridge, because it has tomato soup in it.

1231
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:59,079
Hold on, I need another pot, what?

1232
01:56:59,079 --> 01:57:09,239
I don't want this.

1233
01:57:09,239 --> 01:57:11,880
I need a pot, why is a small pot of fucking onion

1234
01:57:11,880 --> 01:57:16,649
or whatever that is, what?

1235
01:57:16,649 --> 01:57:21,239
Wait, can I fit potatoes in here?

1236
01:57:21,239 --> 01:57:29,649
Oh boy, it's not done, it wasn't done.

1237
01:57:29,649 --> 01:57:38,699
All right, I need a thousand milliliters of water.

1238
01:57:38,699 --> 01:57:45,279
Turn it on, please.

1239
01:57:50,710 --> 01:57:52,949
Okay, don't put the salmon in there.

1240
01:57:52,949 --> 01:57:54,909
All right, just take it off, take it off, it's done.

1241
01:57:54,909 --> 01:57:56,590
It's done, it's done, okay.

1242
01:57:58,529 --> 01:58:09,689
Water, salt, 20 grams of salt, okay.

1243
01:58:09,689 --> 01:58:16,159
Then we need potatoes, 300 grams of potatoes.

1244
01:58:16,159 --> 01:58:17,560
How many grams of these?

1245
01:58:17,560 --> 01:58:23,079
Two of these, that's fine, it's all right.

1246
01:58:23,079 --> 01:58:28,489
The water's gonna wash them, don't worry.

1247
01:58:28,489 --> 01:58:32,590
Fry, boil for 120 seconds.

1248
01:58:32,590 --> 01:58:37,750
They're not even covered.

1249
01:58:37,750 --> 01:58:40,289
Turn the water off.

1250
01:58:40,289 --> 01:58:42,810
No, that's on, that's full blast.

1251
01:58:42,810 --> 01:58:51,659
How do I turn off the water?

1252
01:58:51,659 --> 01:59:03,000
Is it done?

1253
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:06,039
This just tastes like water.

1254
01:59:06,039 --> 01:59:06,880
I didn't forget the salt.

1255
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:08,359
There's a bunch of salt in there.

1256
01:59:08,359 --> 01:59:18,159
I think this is done.

1257
01:59:18,159 --> 01:59:20,289
Okay, now I need a plate.

1258
01:59:20,289 --> 01:59:30,909
That's it, that's literally it.

1259
01:59:30,909 --> 01:59:35,420
Do I have to slice them up or no?

1260
01:59:35,420 --> 01:59:39,470
Should I slice the potatoes?

1261
01:59:39,470 --> 01:59:42,149
What a shitty dinner.

1262
01:59:42,149 --> 01:59:45,739
Nothing on the potatoes, just two potatoes?

1263
01:59:45,739 --> 01:59:46,819
You gotta put something on there.

1264
01:59:46,819 --> 01:59:48,380
There's gotta be something else on there.

1265
01:59:48,380 --> 01:59:51,750
Am I doing that right?

1266
01:59:51,750 --> 01:59:55,010
Was there a Band-Aid on that one?

1267
01:59:55,010 --> 01:59:59,880
Just two boiled potatoes, there's nothing on it?

1268
01:59:59,880 --> 02:00:02,239
You gotta put pepper or onion powder,

1269
02:00:02,279 --> 02:00:07,800
there's just two boiled potatoes.

1270
02:00:07,800 --> 02:00:14,619
All right, where am I?

1271
02:00:14,619 --> 02:00:15,460
Where are you?

1272
02:00:15,460 --> 02:00:18,479
There you are, okay.

1273
02:00:18,479 --> 02:00:20,079
This is the last order for today, okay, cool.

1274
02:00:20,079 --> 02:00:22,079
Prepare for tomorrow.

1275
02:00:22,079 --> 02:00:26,640
I gotta clean up, this is a disaster.

1276
02:00:26,640 --> 02:00:29,399
Turn that off.

1277
02:00:29,399 --> 02:00:37,630
How much water has gone in here?

1278
02:00:37,630 --> 02:00:39,909
Guys, I can't turn the sink off.

1279
02:00:44,350 --> 02:00:46,510
I can't, okay.

1280
02:00:46,510 --> 02:01:03,949
Jesus, what's this taste like?

1281
02:01:03,949 --> 02:01:10,810
Okay, not bad, clean up for tomorrow.

1282
02:01:15,470 --> 02:01:26,000
This is a mess.

1283
02:01:26,079 --> 02:01:29,720
I gotta get a new recipe too.

1284
02:01:29,720 --> 02:01:32,520
Anything left in here?

1285
02:01:32,520 --> 02:01:38,000
There's only one, no, throw this in the trash.

1286
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:42,720
Is this still good?

1287
02:01:42,720 --> 02:01:46,090
I think this is still good, just put it back in the fridge.

1288
02:01:46,090 --> 02:01:48,010
It's only been out for like three hours,

1289
02:01:48,010 --> 02:01:52,710
the bacteria's already started to grow on it, it's fine.

1290
02:01:52,710 --> 02:01:54,239
That's okay, right?

1291
02:01:54,239 --> 02:02:03,359
Use the, there's a hose?

1292
02:02:03,359 --> 02:02:04,800
I got that soup that's still gonna be good

1293
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:10,079
for a day or two, at least.

1294
02:02:10,079 --> 02:02:12,430
Nothing's on, right?

1295
02:02:12,430 --> 02:02:15,350
How much is in this?

1296
02:02:15,350 --> 02:02:19,130
There's still plenty in here.

1297
02:02:19,130 --> 02:02:20,960
How much is in here?

1298
02:02:20,960 --> 02:02:23,680
Not really anything.

1299
02:02:23,720 --> 02:02:27,609
Fuck, just put that right there.

1300
02:02:27,609 --> 02:02:30,220
How much is left in this?

1301
02:02:30,220 --> 02:02:34,220
There's still some in there.

1302
02:02:34,220 --> 02:02:41,250
Yep, we're good.

1303
02:02:41,250 --> 02:02:42,680
It doesn't matter.

1304
02:02:42,680 --> 02:02:44,720
Still have a lemon that can stay there just fine.

1305
02:02:44,720 --> 02:02:48,460
All right, put that over here.

1306
02:02:48,460 --> 02:02:56,319
I think I'm ready, I think I'm good to go.

1307
02:02:56,319 --> 02:03:00,329
Okay, wait, fire extinguisher?

1308
02:03:00,329 --> 02:03:03,279
Wait, tomato, straight tomato.

1309
02:03:03,279 --> 02:03:06,039
It can be on the counter, that's fine.

1310
02:03:06,039 --> 02:03:07,479
Oh, what about this shit?

1311
02:03:07,479 --> 02:03:10,079
How much is left in here?

1312
02:03:10,079 --> 02:03:13,000
That's enough, that's fine, put it here.

1313
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:13,840
What do you got in this one?

1314
02:03:13,840 --> 02:03:19,590
Some of these are new.

1315
02:03:19,590 --> 02:03:22,149
All right, what do we got?

1316
02:03:22,149 --> 02:03:27,960
That's brand new.

1317
02:03:27,960 --> 02:03:32,619
I think I'm ready.

1318
02:03:32,619 --> 02:03:38,819
That wasn't a bad first day.

1319
02:03:38,819 --> 02:03:40,300
This is my first time watching somebody

1320
02:03:40,300 --> 02:03:46,659
play this seriously.

1321
02:03:46,659 --> 02:03:52,239
I mean, I'm trying.

1322
02:03:52,239 --> 02:03:58,079
Ooh, walk faster, I want that.

1323
02:03:58,079 --> 02:04:01,260
Or, yeah, definitely I wanna be able

1324
02:04:01,260 --> 02:04:04,789
to move around faster for sure.

1325
02:04:04,789 --> 02:04:06,069
Okay, level up.

1326
02:04:06,069 --> 02:04:07,109
Skill points available.

1327
02:04:07,109 --> 02:04:11,880

Products are cheaper, give me that one too.

Buying recipes is cheaper as well, let's go.

Here we go, bingo.

1334
02:04:31,479 --> 02:04:33,279
You're gonna spill some stuff now.

1335
02:04:35,449 --> 02:04:37,250
Everybody's just waiting for me to drop shit.

1336
02:04:37,250 --> 02:04:40,159
That's like why everybody's here.

1337
02:04:40,159 --> 02:04:41,600
You guys are all just sitting on the edge of your seat,

1338
02:04:41,600 --> 02:04:42,920
just like, when is he gonna drop the plate

1339
02:04:42,920 --> 02:04:45,859
with all the food on it?

1340
02:04:45,859 --> 02:04:46,859
All right, let's get an order.

1341
02:04:46,859 --> 02:04:51,909
I don't think I'm pretty prepared.

1342
02:04:51,909 --> 02:05:00,760
Okay, let me buy a, let's get a new recipe.

1343
02:05:00,760 --> 02:05:04,739
What do I, okay, I have 17.

1344
02:05:04,739 --> 02:05:05,579
Ooh, what's this thing?

1345
02:05:05,579 --> 02:05:06,819
A steak and potatoes?

1346
02:05:06,819 --> 02:05:11,619
T-bone steak?

1347
02:05:11,619 --> 02:05:13,819
Is it like a cheeseburger?

1348
02:05:14,619 --> 02:05:18,079
Oh, hell yeah, how much is this?

1349
02:05:18,079 --> 02:05:19,359
Oh, I need 24, all right.

1350
02:05:19,359 --> 02:05:21,550
I definitely want the cheeseburger, for sure.

1351
02:05:21,550 --> 02:05:25,039
I'm saving up for the cheeseburger.

1352
02:05:25,039 --> 02:05:27,279
Yeah, I'm not, I'm just gonna save for the cheeseburger.

1353
02:05:27,279 --> 02:05:31,699
I got trout coming, here we go.

1354
02:05:31,699 --> 02:05:32,979
You have an order, I know, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1355
02:05:32,979 --> 02:05:38,399
Okay, it's the trout, I got that in the fridge.

1356
02:05:38,399 --> 02:05:40,979
Okay, trout, Andy.

1357
02:05:40,979 --> 02:05:45,619
Okay, and that was pepper, thyme, and dill.

1358
02:05:45,619 --> 02:05:56,859
Easy, it's all right.

1359
02:05:56,859 --> 02:06:01,319
Pepper, thyme, and dill, five of each.

1360
02:06:01,319 --> 02:06:03,079
It's gonna be very, very peppery.

1361
02:06:03,079 --> 02:06:06,119
It's gonna be very peppery, Jerry.

1362
02:06:06,119 --> 02:06:07,760
All right, baking tray, 90 seconds.

1363
02:06:07,760 --> 02:06:10,359
Wow, I have, okay, wait, horseradish.

1364
02:06:10,359 --> 02:06:20,149
Oh, I didn't put horseradish on it last time, whatever.

1365
02:06:20,149 --> 02:06:21,270
It's already on.

1366
02:06:21,270 --> 02:06:22,550
All right, 90 seconds, horseradish right there

1367
02:06:22,550 --> 02:06:24,210
after it comes out.

1368
02:06:24,210 --> 02:06:36,170
I need the lemon quarters, you got it, and fours, good.

1369
02:06:36,170 --> 02:06:38,569
Okay, that's good now, done.

1370
02:06:38,569 --> 02:06:39,890
Lemon, got the horseradish over there.

1371
02:06:39,890 --> 02:06:52,039
Garnish with parsley leaves, fresh, okay, almost ready.

1372
02:06:52,039 --> 02:07:03,199
I wanna hold more than one snip.

1373
02:07:03,199 --> 02:07:11,279
I need more, I don't wanna, I need more than one snip.

1374
02:07:11,279 --> 02:07:14,930
The gas leak?

1375
02:07:14,930 --> 02:07:17,199
Okay, that's definitely done.

1376
02:07:17,199 --> 02:07:20,170
It's turned black.

1377
02:07:20,170 --> 02:07:27,210
Good, huh?

1378
02:07:27,210 --> 02:07:57,479
Damn it, I need a plate, not bad, not bad.

1379
02:07:57,479 --> 02:08:02,960
I was just gonna frisbee it over there.

1380
02:08:02,960 --> 02:08:09,789
Wait, is my underwear showing?

1381
02:08:09,789 --> 02:08:19,199
Okay, stay on, I'm just gonna hold it.

1382
02:08:19,199 --> 02:08:26,750
Wait, wait, wait, wait, stuff's falling off.

1383
02:08:26,750 --> 02:08:40,659
There it is, wait, wait, wait, no, take this fish.

1384
02:08:40,659 --> 02:08:48,720
What, are you kidding me?

1385
02:08:48,720 --> 02:08:50,890
Why did it not take the fish?

1386
02:08:50,890 --> 02:08:52,170
I'm leaving this here.

1387
02:08:52,170 --> 02:08:57,399
I'm gonna put this in the microwave.

1388
02:08:57,399 --> 02:09:17,439
I'm just gonna reheat this when I need to use it again.

1389
02:09:17,439 --> 02:09:19,649
What's gonna happen to this thing?

1390
02:09:19,649 --> 02:09:23,060
For five minutes?

1391
02:09:23,060 --> 02:09:26,850
Does anybody else get freaked out when something,

1392
02:09:26,850 --> 02:09:29,810
a frozen dinner or something or some recipe calls,

1393
02:09:29,810 --> 02:09:31,329
especially in a frozen thing,

1394
02:09:31,329 --> 02:09:35,619
to microwave this thing for more than five to 10 minutes?

1395
02:09:35,619 --> 02:09:37,100
I'm always like, I don't wanna do it for that long.

1396
02:09:37,100 --> 02:09:46,520
I feel like there's extra radiation.

1397
02:09:46,520 --> 02:09:47,479
I don't like that.

1398
02:09:47,479 --> 02:09:50,189
I don't like the microwave really at all.

1399
02:09:50,189 --> 02:09:52,680
I don't like what I'm doing, okay.

1400
02:09:52,680 --> 02:09:55,079
Take, okay, salmon, salmon, salmon, salmon, salmon.

1401
02:09:55,079 --> 02:09:58,029
It's gonna be nice and warmed up for whoever wants it.

1402
02:09:58,029 --> 02:10:00,029
Imagine eating a microwaved fish.

1403
02:10:01,199 --> 02:10:05,319
It's just, you don't even understand cooking.

1404
02:10:05,319 --> 02:10:08,880
You don't even know what, you don't get food at all.

1405
02:10:08,880 --> 02:10:10,600
Like this thing just heats stuff up

1406
02:10:10,600 --> 02:10:14,579
and that's all you, that's all you know.

1407
02:10:14,579 --> 02:10:16,880
You're mutating?

1408
02:10:16,880 --> 02:10:17,960
All right, let's get it.

1409
02:10:17,960 --> 02:10:20,689
Okay, steak and potatoes or whatever it is.

1410
02:10:20,689 --> 02:10:29,079
Thousand milliliters of water.

1411
02:10:29,079 --> 02:10:31,960
That was perfect in that.

1412
02:10:31,960 --> 02:10:36,390
Okay, get that on here.

1413
02:10:36,390 --> 02:10:44,039
Start the process here, salt.

1414
02:10:44,039 --> 02:10:57,560
I need the potatoes too, whoops.

1415
02:10:57,560 --> 02:10:59,159
60 seconds.

1416
02:10:59,159 --> 02:11:07,199
Let's check on this.

1417
02:11:07,199 --> 02:11:09,279
Okay, we're actually like coming into like,

1418
02:11:09,520 --> 02:11:10,720
apartment or your house or something

1419
02:11:10,720 --> 02:11:12,600
and like you have roommate or you're like,

1420
02:11:12,600 --> 02:11:17,960
somebody's just sitting there just going like this.

1421
02:11:17,960 --> 02:11:21,100
Oh, hey man, hey.

1422
02:11:21,100 --> 02:11:24,420
Yeah, I really felt like fish today.

1423
02:11:24,420 --> 02:11:26,819
Is that a case where you like are moving shit

1424
02:11:26,819 --> 02:11:27,659
out of the way?

1425
02:11:27,659 --> 02:11:31,500
You're like moving like people and things out of the way

1426
02:11:31,500 --> 02:11:33,939
to like, Mike, Mike, Mike, don't, wait a minute.

1427
02:11:33,939 --> 02:11:34,779
Stop, stop, stop.

1428
02:11:34,779 --> 02:11:37,020
Like you're like literally shoving stuff out of the way.

1429
02:11:37,020 --> 02:11:38,140
Like you're in a fucking drama,

1430
02:11:38,140 --> 02:11:41,310
like a horror movie or something.

1431
02:11:41,310 --> 02:11:47,800
To like get here to turn this off, right?

1432
02:11:47,800 --> 02:11:55,180
He's done?

1433
02:11:55,180 --> 02:11:58,279
I just like ruined it.

1434
02:11:58,279 --> 02:12:00,119
All right, so this is, oh no, I have to cook this.

1435
02:12:00,119 --> 02:12:07,109
So what am I doing?

1436
02:12:07,109 --> 02:12:10,109
Oh, it's gonna be fried.

1437
02:12:10,109 --> 02:12:13,670
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

1438
02:12:13,670 --> 02:12:22,399
Put a little bit extra oil in there.

1439
02:12:22,399 --> 02:12:31,479
60, wait, where's the timer?

1440
02:12:31,479 --> 02:12:37,050
How do you start the timer?

1441
02:12:37,050 --> 02:12:39,350
Oh my God, okay.

1442
02:12:39,350 --> 02:12:45,850
What are you doing?

1443
02:12:45,850 --> 02:12:49,869
All right, another few seconds.

1444
02:12:49,869 --> 02:13:03,119
I need a plate.

1445
02:13:03,119 --> 02:13:07,810
Don't do that.

1446
02:13:07,810 --> 02:13:12,319
That wasn't even enough time, what?

1447
02:13:12,319 --> 02:13:13,159
Plate, where's the plate?

1448
02:13:13,159 --> 02:13:37,619
Here we go, potatoes.

1449
02:13:37,619 --> 02:13:39,729
It's a phone.

1450
02:13:39,729 --> 02:13:41,329
Oh wait, that's the timer.

1451
02:13:41,329 --> 02:13:42,569
That's the timer.

1452
02:13:42,569 --> 02:14:40,579
All right, turn it, spin it, spin it, spin it.

1453
02:14:40,579 --> 02:14:50,460
That'll have been a tomato's freshness.

1454
02:14:50,460 --> 02:14:53,760
Okay, nevermind.

1455
02:14:53,760 --> 02:14:58,859
Oh, who wants plain food?

1456
02:14:58,859 --> 02:15:07,159
Oh, it smells so good.

1457
02:15:07,159 --> 02:15:08,880
Oh, who wants food that's on the table

1458
02:15:08,880 --> 02:15:11,239
at every RPG you've ever played?

1459
02:15:11,239 --> 02:15:21,199
Oh, me, dude, me.

1460
02:15:21,199 --> 02:15:22,039
Tomato soup?

1461
02:15:22,039 --> 02:15:24,010
Oh, I got you.

1462
02:15:24,010 --> 02:15:28,159
I got you.

1463
02:15:28,159 --> 02:15:29,680
Chef Ramsay goes into the kitchen

1464
02:15:29,680 --> 02:15:32,329
and finds something he could never believe.

1465
02:15:32,329 --> 02:15:33,649
What'd you say?

1466
02:15:33,649 --> 02:15:34,970
It's inside the fridge.

1467
02:15:34,970 --> 02:15:36,550
When'd you make it?

1468
02:15:36,550 --> 02:15:37,630
I don't know.

1469
02:15:37,630 --> 02:15:40,430
I don't know, maybe two weeks ago.

1470
02:15:40,430 --> 02:15:41,670
Two weeks?

1471
02:15:41,670 --> 02:15:43,109
No, come on.

1472
02:15:43,109 --> 02:15:44,189
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1473
02:15:44,189 --> 02:15:46,829
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun,

1474
02:15:46,829 --> 02:15:49,520
dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

1475
02:15:49,520 --> 02:15:50,760
I don't know, I don't know anything.

1476
02:15:50,760 --> 02:15:52,439
I don't know anything about food.

1477
02:15:52,439 --> 02:15:58,159
I just wasted all that making a stupid joke.

1478
02:15:58,159 --> 02:16:03,579
No, what, no.

1479
02:16:03,579 --> 02:16:07,359
You put it in the fridge.

1480
02:16:07,359 --> 02:16:10,600
Yeah, I mean, I don't know anything about tomatoes.

1481
02:16:10,600 --> 02:16:18,829
What's a tomato?

1482
02:16:18,829 --> 02:16:24,079
I need a plate, I need a plate right now.

1483
02:16:24,079 --> 02:16:28,350
Is that right?

1484
02:16:28,350 --> 02:16:32,159
I don't think so.

1485
02:16:32,159 --> 02:16:40,239
No, it is, okay.

1486
02:16:40,239 --> 02:16:41,479
Wait, I have to heat this up.

1487
02:16:41,479 --> 02:16:42,719
It's just ice cold.

1488
02:16:46,239 --> 02:16:47,879
No, what are you doing?

1489
02:16:47,879 --> 02:16:50,399
I thought I would put the tomatoes on there.

1490
02:16:50,399 --> 02:16:54,680
No, oh, you fucking donkey, you idiot.

1491
02:16:54,680 --> 02:16:56,079
Do you see what you're doing?

1492
02:16:56,079 --> 02:17:02,190
Do you see what you're doing?

1493
02:17:02,190 --> 02:17:06,319
Wait, how about a little garnish?

1494
02:17:06,319 --> 02:17:15,530
I need to heat this up.

1495
02:17:15,530 --> 02:17:17,090
Whoa, why is it black?

1496
02:17:17,090 --> 02:17:20,840
Why is it black?

1497
02:17:20,840 --> 02:17:21,680
What?

1498
02:17:23,829 --> 02:17:24,670
Oh.

1499
02:17:37,409 --> 02:17:39,639
Michael, come here, please.

1500
02:17:39,639 --> 02:17:41,129
Yes, chef.

1501
02:17:43,020 --> 02:17:45,780
What you served me was motor oil.

1502
02:17:45,780 --> 02:17:47,840
Motor oil.

1503
02:17:47,840 --> 02:17:49,440
And I'm not talking about that's the consistency,

1504
02:17:49,440 --> 02:17:50,770
that's what it was.

1505
02:17:50,770 --> 02:17:52,799
I watched you pour it in there.

1506
02:17:52,799 --> 02:17:54,639
Valvoline.

1507
02:17:54,639 --> 02:18:00,520
Yeah, I don't know how to use a knife, chef.

1508
02:18:00,520 --> 02:18:07,430
I have no idea.

1509
02:18:07,430 --> 02:18:10,899
Hello?

1510
02:18:10,899 --> 02:18:14,440
This is fucking rancid.

1511
02:18:14,440 --> 02:18:17,790
Wait, I can play darts?

1512
02:18:17,790 --> 02:18:19,270
The fish is done.

1513
02:18:23,450 --> 02:18:34,020
Oh, another salmon.

1514
02:18:34,020 --> 02:18:36,149
What's this?

1515
02:18:36,149 --> 02:18:38,209
What do you think you're serving me here?

1516
02:18:38,209 --> 02:18:44,110
What are you out of your fucking mind?

1517
02:18:44,110 --> 02:18:44,950
Did you make this?

1518
02:18:44,950 --> 02:18:47,370
You made this one right here?

1519
02:18:47,370 --> 02:18:49,530
It's just disgusting is what it is.

1520
02:18:49,530 --> 02:18:50,930
It's absolutely disgusting.

1521
02:18:57,819 --> 02:18:58,659
You see, I'm hip.

1522
02:18:58,659 --> 02:19:02,120
I know all the fucking jokes, everybody knows.

1523
02:19:02,120 --> 02:19:16,520
All right, I need salmon, salmon, salmon.

1524
02:19:16,520 --> 02:19:20,479
Oh, Mr. Ramsey, I've got a special delicious dish for you.

1525
02:19:20,479 --> 02:19:22,000
Do you think I would get kicked off immediately

1526
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:25,229
if I was like walking around like this?

1527
02:19:25,229 --> 02:19:33,809
Okay, here we go.

1528
02:19:33,809 --> 02:19:39,559
I need more potatoes.

1529
02:19:39,559 --> 02:19:41,170
Bugs in the pan.

1530
02:19:43,120 --> 02:19:54,350
Oh, potatoes, two potatoes and water.

1531
02:19:54,350 --> 02:19:55,190
What am I doing?

1532
02:19:55,190 --> 02:20:09,680
Oh, let's go.

1533
02:20:09,680 --> 02:20:19,899
Salt it up.

1534
02:20:19,899 --> 02:20:21,659
Oh yeah, I hate that shit.

1535
02:20:21,659 --> 02:20:24,200
I hate that more than anything.

1536
02:20:24,200 --> 02:20:25,840
I hate that.

1537
02:20:25,840 --> 02:20:27,159
They're like wafting shit.

1538
02:20:27,159 --> 02:20:28,200
No, don't do that.

1539
02:20:28,200 --> 02:20:29,600
Get away from me with that shit.

1540
02:20:29,600 --> 02:20:32,840
It's just weird.

1541
02:20:32,840 --> 02:20:34,770
Why do people do that?

1542
02:20:34,770 --> 02:20:36,409
I swear to God, people do that.

1543
02:20:36,409 --> 02:20:37,250
They pretend.

1544
02:20:37,250 --> 02:20:40,819
I know I've talked about this before.

1545
02:20:40,819 --> 02:20:46,250
Going like, oh, stop, just go like this.

1546
02:20:46,530 --> 02:20:48,649
Just look, it's so gross to me.

1547
02:20:48,649 --> 02:20:49,489
I don't know why.

1548
02:20:49,489 --> 02:20:55,510
I hate it.

1549
02:20:55,510 --> 02:20:58,229
It's a basic, I know, but it's something about it.

1550
02:20:58,229 --> 02:20:59,709
I hate everything about it.

1551
02:21:03,049 --> 02:21:04,610
What, it's going like this?

1552
02:21:04,610 --> 02:21:15,090
What, can I breathe in the vapors and burn my nose?

1553
02:21:15,090 --> 02:21:18,170
Yes.

1554
02:21:18,170 --> 02:21:20,909
What if you leaned in and got boogers in it?

1555
02:21:20,909 --> 02:21:22,989
Yeah, what if I went like this

1556
02:21:22,989 --> 02:21:24,909
and my sweat on my hand dropped in?

1557
02:21:24,909 --> 02:21:30,760
That argument does not hold any weight for me at all.

1558
02:21:30,760 --> 02:21:43,569
I need a plate.

1559
02:21:43,569 --> 02:21:45,479
What's he doing?

1560
02:21:45,479 --> 02:22:03,459
Oh, what is he doing?

1561
02:22:03,459 --> 02:22:05,319
They love my food.

1562
02:22:05,319 --> 02:22:06,840
They love my food.

1563
02:22:06,840 --> 02:22:09,850
They just do.

1564
02:22:09,850 --> 02:22:12,590
Not bad.

1565
02:22:12,590 --> 02:22:17,659
Booger?

1566
02:22:17,659 --> 02:22:21,540
What is, booger?

1567
02:22:21,540 --> 02:22:24,500
Guys, I don't know who you think I am

1568
02:22:24,500 --> 02:22:26,760
or what you think is kind of wrong with me,

1569
02:22:26,760 --> 02:22:29,680
but there's not just water dripping out of my nose.

1570
02:22:29,680 --> 02:22:34,479
Do waters not just, if I lean over something,

1571
02:22:34,479 --> 02:22:39,040
I'm not just gonna like, huh?

1572
02:22:39,040 --> 02:22:42,329
What are you talking about?

1573
02:22:42,329 --> 02:22:43,370
Make a lemon soup.

1574
02:22:43,370 --> 02:22:46,010
Oh, that's a good idea.

1575
02:22:46,010 --> 02:22:48,219
I'm getting so tangled up.

1576
02:22:48,219 --> 02:22:49,059
That's a good idea.

1577
02:22:49,059 --> 02:22:49,899
Lemon soup?

1578
02:22:49,899 --> 02:23:05,700
Sure.

1579
02:23:05,700 --> 02:23:09,879
This is gonna make a lot.

1580
02:23:09,879 --> 02:23:12,299
Okay.

1581
02:23:12,299 --> 02:23:15,319
Start the boiling process here.

1582
02:23:15,319 --> 02:23:17,260
So I need lemons.

1583
02:23:17,260 --> 02:23:18,100
Should I cut them up?

1584
02:23:18,100 --> 02:23:30,059
What do you think?

1585
02:23:30,059 --> 02:23:35,870
Just boil them with the rinds on?

1586
02:23:35,870 --> 02:23:44,659
Maybe an onion?

1587
02:23:44,659 --> 02:23:46,639
And then mush them up.

1588
02:23:46,639 --> 02:23:50,260
I need to stick blend them.

1589
02:23:50,260 --> 02:23:53,639
Okay.

1590
02:23:53,639 --> 02:24:06,309
Ooh, it's actually turning, that's cool.

1591
02:24:06,309 --> 02:24:09,639
I have more?

1592
02:24:09,639 --> 02:24:12,479
Wait, what if I like boiled a piece of salmon in there?

1593
02:24:12,479 --> 02:24:14,190
Would that be good?

1594
02:24:14,190 --> 02:24:21,530
Would that taste good?

1595
02:24:21,530 --> 02:24:28,100
That would be kind of interesting.

1596
02:24:28,100 --> 02:24:33,040
No, why would I, yeah, salt can go in there.

1597
02:24:33,040 --> 02:24:37,760
Salt and pepper.

1598
02:24:37,760 --> 02:24:40,770
Looks good.

1599
02:24:40,770 --> 02:24:49,000
It looks like it's cooking, hold on.

1600
02:24:49,040 --> 02:24:51,350
I'm making baby food.

1601
02:24:51,350 --> 02:24:52,629
These are the ingredients on the back

1602
02:24:52,629 --> 02:24:56,149
of like a Gerber salmon paste.

1603
02:24:56,149 --> 02:25:12,079
Hold it, how many can I put in there?

1604
02:25:12,079 --> 02:25:13,280
This is gross.

1605
02:25:13,280 --> 02:25:17,219
And I just wasted like $30.

1606
02:25:17,219 --> 02:25:19,079
What baby?

1607
02:25:19,079 --> 02:25:19,920
What do you mean baby?

1608
02:25:19,920 --> 02:25:21,399
Baby, do not, don't feed this to babies.

1609
02:25:21,399 --> 02:25:22,239
What?

1610
02:25:22,239 --> 02:25:25,299
I don't understand.

1611
02:25:25,299 --> 02:25:27,559
Wait, what are you talking about?

1612
02:25:27,559 --> 02:25:37,040
What are you talking about?

1613
02:25:37,040 --> 02:25:39,790
Babies?

1614
02:25:39,790 --> 02:25:41,389
Well, I'm not saying that you feed this to a baby.

1615
02:25:41,389 --> 02:25:43,229
I'm just saying like that, like this is like,

1616
02:25:43,229 --> 02:25:45,670
you put like a bunch of paste into a jar.

1617
02:25:45,670 --> 02:25:46,909
You just grind up a bunch of stuff

1618
02:25:46,909 --> 02:25:49,389
and it turns into baby, like peas and carrots and,

1619
02:25:49,389 --> 02:25:50,870
I don't know, whatever else is mushrooms.

1620
02:25:50,870 --> 02:25:52,149
I don't know what else is in it.

1621
02:25:52,149 --> 02:25:53,889
What's in baby food?

1622
02:25:53,889 --> 02:25:56,280
Peas, carrots.

1623
02:25:56,280 --> 02:25:58,600
What else is in baby food?

1624
02:25:58,600 --> 02:26:07,809
Is it just ground up peas?

1625
02:26:07,809 --> 02:26:10,299
Hello?

1626
02:26:10,299 --> 02:26:13,239
What happened?

1627
02:26:13,239 --> 02:26:14,639
Somebody said go into, yeah, let me,

1628
02:26:14,639 --> 02:26:20,969
I wanna go to sandbox mode.

1629
02:26:20,969 --> 02:26:21,930
I wanna do sandbox mode.

1630
02:26:21,930 --> 02:26:28,360
I wanna just, I wanna make like pizzas and shit.

1631
02:26:28,360 --> 02:26:33,360
Yeah, we're doing sandbox.

1632
02:26:33,360 --> 02:26:34,399
Make a hamburger helper?

1633
02:26:34,399 --> 02:26:37,659
I will make hamburger helper for you, I will.

1634
02:26:37,659 --> 02:26:47,440
Let's do sandbox.

1635
02:26:47,440 --> 02:26:48,879
I just burped, I'm so sorry.

1636
02:27:03,510 --> 02:27:05,850
Ooh, new kitchen, hell yeah.

1637
02:27:05,850 --> 02:27:07,129
All right, now it's time for me to make you

1638
02:27:07,129 --> 02:27:09,540
my famous hamburger helper.

1639
02:27:09,540 --> 02:27:13,159
It's very easy to make.

1640
02:27:13,159 --> 02:27:14,760
The beef stroganoff is probably my favorite.

1641
02:27:14,760 --> 02:27:16,440
I like cheeseburger macaroni, it's pretty good too,

1642
02:27:16,440 --> 02:27:23,309
but nah, I don't think it's as good as the stroganoff.

1643
02:27:23,309 --> 02:27:26,059
Oh damn.

1644
02:27:26,059 --> 02:27:33,879
Okay, what do we got?

1645
02:27:33,879 --> 02:27:38,829
Right here, we'll start with,

1646
02:27:38,829 --> 02:27:41,079
I just wanna wreck this place.

1647
02:27:41,079 --> 02:27:43,120
Okay, what do we got?

1648
02:27:43,120 --> 02:27:44,719
First of all, let's get a plate.

1649
02:27:44,719 --> 02:27:45,840
If you're gonna have hamburger helper,

1650
02:27:45,840 --> 02:27:47,299
you need one of these,

1651
02:27:47,299 --> 02:27:49,540
because it's literally just shlop.

1652
02:27:49,540 --> 02:27:51,350
It's just shlop.

1653
02:27:51,350 --> 02:27:55,530
It's just a big thing of shlop and that's all it is.

1654
02:27:55,530 --> 02:27:57,930
Start, get our prep station ready, please.

1655
02:28:02,889 --> 02:28:04,799
Okay.

1656
02:28:05,840 --> 02:28:07,159
Michael Jackson?

1657
02:28:09,159 --> 02:28:10,799
I need to put two on.

1658
02:28:10,799 --> 02:28:13,680
I don't wanna be like, okay.

1659
02:28:13,680 --> 02:28:18,600
Should I even have gloves?

1660
02:28:18,600 --> 02:28:19,879
Oh, you do asparagus too?

1661
02:28:19,879 --> 02:28:24,229
Nice.

1662
02:28:25,309 --> 02:28:28,959
Dr. Shlop, bacon?

1663
02:28:28,959 --> 02:28:31,719
Hold on, I just wanna, I want bacon.

1664
02:28:31,719 --> 02:28:37,120
What is this tiny little shit bacon, what?

1665
02:28:37,120 --> 02:28:40,579
This is bacon?

1666
02:28:40,579 --> 02:28:46,799
This is not bacon.

1667
02:28:46,799 --> 02:28:50,440
Holy shit, a banana.

1668
02:28:50,440 --> 02:28:52,879
All right, stop messing around.

1669
02:28:52,879 --> 02:29:00,049
Burger meat, do they just have ground beef?

1670
02:29:00,090 --> 02:29:04,299
We'll make cheeseburger mac.

1671
02:29:04,299 --> 02:29:10,520
Need a few of these.

1672
02:29:10,520 --> 02:29:17,579
Okay, burger meat, but do they have ground beef?

1673
02:29:17,579 --> 02:29:20,270
Goat cheese, disgusting.

1674
02:29:20,270 --> 02:29:24,049
Absolutely revolting.

1675
02:29:24,049 --> 02:29:30,350
I don't see G, ground beef.

1676
02:29:30,350 --> 02:29:33,920
I don't see it.

1677
02:29:33,920 --> 02:29:36,239
No, they have hamburger meat, like burger meat,

1678
02:29:36,239 --> 02:29:41,120
but I feel like this is a patty.

1679
02:29:41,120 --> 02:29:42,920
Probably is, right?

1680
02:29:42,920 --> 02:29:54,370
Yeah, can I chop this up?

1681
02:29:54,370 --> 02:30:01,600
I can chop this up, right?

1682
02:30:01,600 --> 02:30:02,760
Okay, I need like a pound.

1683
02:30:02,760 --> 02:30:07,159
And then we'll also do,

1684
02:30:07,159 --> 02:30:08,440
oh, there's beef chuck.

1685
02:30:09,520 --> 02:30:10,920
Wait, can I grind this up?

1686
02:30:10,959 --> 02:30:19,459
Do I have a grinder?

1687
02:30:19,459 --> 02:30:30,920
Is this a grinder?

1688
02:30:30,920 --> 02:30:34,709
I mean, these chunks are too big.

1689
02:30:34,709 --> 02:30:46,520
Can I do it to the patty?

1690
02:30:46,520 --> 02:30:47,360
No.

1691
02:30:47,360 --> 02:30:48,200
Oh, I can.

1692
02:30:48,200 --> 02:30:49,920
Oh, nice, nice, nice, right, right, okay, okay.

1693
02:30:49,920 --> 02:30:54,319
Can I chop these up even thinner and finer?

1694
02:30:54,319 --> 02:30:55,159
Let me see a knife.

1695
02:30:55,159 --> 02:31:02,780
Let me see if I can chop this up.

1696
02:31:02,780 --> 02:31:04,950
No.

1697
02:31:04,950 --> 02:31:09,110
All right, this is gonna have to do.

1698
02:31:09,110 --> 02:31:10,149
There's a lot to do.

1699
02:31:10,149 --> 02:31:14,190
Get it in here.

1700
02:31:14,190 --> 02:31:22,520
Blend the beef?

1701
02:31:22,520 --> 02:31:23,920
Um, no.

1702
02:31:23,920 --> 02:31:25,639
No, we're not doing that.

1703
02:31:25,639 --> 02:31:26,959
What do I do with this?

1704
02:31:26,959 --> 02:31:32,000
This, no, I'm not gonna feed it to the plant.

1705
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:35,709
We're not doing that.

1706
02:31:35,709 --> 02:31:36,549
All right, just put these over here

1707
02:31:36,549 --> 02:31:39,680
because I'm gonna ground all this up.

1708
02:31:39,680 --> 02:31:40,879
We're gonna grind the cheese too.

1709
02:31:40,879 --> 02:31:47,149
It'll be nice and melty.

1710
02:31:47,149 --> 02:31:49,239
Ooh, all right.

1711
02:31:49,239 --> 02:31:56,969
Let's do this real quick.

1712
02:31:56,969 --> 02:31:58,450
Oops, that was a mistake.

1713
02:31:58,450 --> 02:32:11,709
It's okay.

1714
02:32:11,709 --> 02:32:17,920
God damn it.

1715
02:32:17,920 --> 02:32:20,389
All right, this is as ground as it's gonna be,

1716
02:32:20,389 --> 02:32:26,520
which is fine.

1717
02:32:26,520 --> 02:32:27,360
Let's get it all.

1718
02:32:27,360 --> 02:32:28,760
There it is.

1719
02:32:28,760 --> 02:32:30,079
There is our ground beef.

1720
02:32:30,079 --> 02:32:33,780
Let's go ahead and get it over on the stove area here.

1721
02:32:33,780 --> 02:32:35,100
Not gonna cook it yet.

1722
02:32:35,100 --> 02:32:36,899
Just gonna get it there.

1723
02:32:36,899 --> 02:32:41,639
Because we gotta brown that meat first and foremost.

1724
02:32:41,639 --> 02:32:42,479
After you brown the meat,

1725
02:32:42,479 --> 02:32:46,250
you're gonna add your cheese and sauce and your macaroni,

1726
02:32:46,250 --> 02:32:49,709
which we need to get that too.

1727
02:32:49,709 --> 02:32:50,870
All right, macaroni.

1728
02:32:55,840 --> 02:32:57,000
Which one do I want?

1729
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:59,159
This one here probably is the one that looks the most.

1730
02:32:59,159 --> 02:33:00,799
Can I see what it looks like?

1731
02:33:00,799 --> 02:33:03,770
Yep, that looks like it's it.

1732
02:33:03,770 --> 02:33:09,309
Okay, sounds good.

1733
02:33:09,309 --> 02:33:10,190
Prep that over here.

1734
02:33:10,190 --> 02:33:16,479
I need a thing to boil this with.

1735
02:33:16,479 --> 02:33:19,750
I'll give me that pan right here.

1736
02:33:19,750 --> 02:33:25,579
All right, so we're gonna go like this.

1737
02:33:25,579 --> 02:33:34,530
How do you turn on one of these fucking stoves?

1738
02:33:34,530 --> 02:33:35,370
All right, that's on.

1739
02:33:35,370 --> 02:33:37,510
I need water in here.

1740
02:33:37,510 --> 02:33:40,350
I mean, technically you don't do that.

1741
02:33:40,350 --> 02:33:43,729
You don't cook the pasta cooks in the sauce mix.

1742
02:33:43,729 --> 02:33:47,340
Well, we need milk.

1743
02:33:47,340 --> 02:33:48,500
This kitchen's too big.

1744
02:33:48,500 --> 02:33:55,420
I don't know how people have kitchens like this.

1745
02:33:55,420 --> 02:34:00,639
All right, I need milk and water.

1746
02:34:00,639 --> 02:34:06,079
Where's milk?

1747
02:34:06,079 --> 02:34:09,219
Do I not have milk?

1748
02:34:09,219 --> 02:34:10,700
Oh, here it is, okay.

1749
02:34:10,700 --> 02:34:15,639
All right, we're gonna do a little bit of this.

1750
02:34:15,639 --> 02:34:18,409
Just getting our, we gotta get our station ready.

1751
02:34:18,409 --> 02:34:21,920
Okay, where's the pasta?

1752
02:34:21,920 --> 02:34:25,959
Where's the sink?

1753
02:34:25,959 --> 02:34:27,690
Where's the sink?

1754
02:34:27,690 --> 02:34:40,409
Oh, how are you supposed to use this thing?

1755
02:34:40,409 --> 02:34:43,020
A little bit more.

1756
02:34:43,020 --> 02:34:46,319
Okay, sounds, don't spill it.

1757
02:34:46,319 --> 02:34:55,680
Get that boiling, ow, that hurt.

1758
02:34:55,680 --> 02:34:57,120
I'm fine though, don't worry about me.

1759
02:34:57,120 --> 02:35:01,200
Okay, so now that's gonna boil.

1760
02:35:01,200 --> 02:35:02,959
Let's get the pasta in there.

1761
02:35:02,959 --> 02:35:09,120
Put the milk in there too.

1762
02:35:09,120 --> 02:35:10,760
That's all that's in this box.

1763
02:35:13,729 --> 02:35:18,120
No way, what?

1764
02:35:18,120 --> 02:35:23,760
This, that's it?

1765
02:35:23,760 --> 02:35:28,209
Well, back to the pantry, I guess.

1766
02:35:28,209 --> 02:35:33,059
Are you serious?

1767
02:35:33,059 --> 02:35:37,030
I need, where's my device?

1768
02:35:37,030 --> 02:35:43,450
Hold on, I didn't wanna buy that.

1769
02:35:43,450 --> 02:35:59,110
Okay, I need, good.

1770
02:35:59,110 --> 02:35:59,950
I don't need sour cream.

1771
02:35:59,950 --> 02:36:02,180
Okay, I need, what do I need?

1772
02:36:02,180 --> 02:36:03,020
What did I just say?

1773
02:36:03,020 --> 02:36:08,299
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, pasta.

1774
02:36:08,299 --> 02:36:09,979
Pasta, pasta, pasta, pasta, pasta.

1775
02:36:09,979 --> 02:36:16,450
That's parsley, miscellaneous.

1776
02:36:16,450 --> 02:36:18,840
Firecracker?

1777
02:36:18,840 --> 02:36:19,959
Halloween candy?

1778
02:36:19,959 --> 02:36:23,440
Stool?

1779
02:36:23,440 --> 02:36:27,149
Oh, look at that.

1780
02:36:27,149 --> 02:36:32,049
That is not what that looks like.

1781
02:36:32,049 --> 02:36:35,719
Then you know it.

1782
02:36:35,719 --> 02:36:44,879
Where, where's the, where's the pasta?

1783
02:36:44,879 --> 02:36:50,510
Spices, products, right, you would imagine.

1784
02:36:50,510 --> 02:36:57,879
I don't see it anywhere.

1785
02:36:57,879 --> 02:37:03,049
Where the hell is it?

1786
02:37:03,049 --> 02:37:04,290
Oh, I missed it, what is it?

1787
02:37:04,290 --> 02:37:06,290
What the hell is it called?

1788
02:37:06,290 --> 02:37:16,250
Fussy, foosy, foosy, foosily.

1789
02:37:16,250 --> 02:37:31,979
All right, I need like three of these.

1790
02:37:31,979 --> 02:37:42,680
All right, let's go.

1791
02:37:42,680 --> 02:37:54,370
What a fucking scam.

1792
02:37:54,370 --> 02:37:55,610
Do I need more water?

1793
02:37:55,610 --> 02:38:17,209
I need more water in here.

1794
02:38:17,209 --> 02:38:21,530
Wait, hold on.

1795
02:38:21,530 --> 02:38:23,649
Can I scoop it back into there with anything

1796
02:38:23,649 --> 02:38:26,030
or do I have to do this whole thing again?

1797
02:38:26,030 --> 02:38:29,909
Hold on, let me scrape it out of the bottom of the sink.

1798
02:38:29,909 --> 02:38:32,799
Hold on.

1799
02:38:32,799 --> 02:38:35,500
Dude, that's so stupid.

1800
02:38:35,500 --> 02:38:38,340
Oh my God, just give me another few boxes.

1801
02:38:39,219 --> 02:38:50,020
Ah, that's gonna make me puke, by the way.

1802
02:38:50,020 --> 02:38:57,750
Jesus, dropping the whole thing in the sink.

1803
02:38:57,750 --> 02:39:00,100
You know what sucks?

1804
02:39:00,100 --> 02:39:02,510
I've done that before.

1805
02:39:02,510 --> 02:39:07,510
I have taken a strainer and poured wet, caught pasta into it

1806
02:39:07,549 --> 02:39:09,030
and it was like a little too heavy

1807
02:39:09,030 --> 02:39:11,309
and it was a little too hot and I dropped it into the sink.

1808
02:39:11,309 --> 02:39:12,920
It's happened before.

1809
02:39:12,920 --> 02:39:15,370
It sucks.

1810
02:39:15,370 --> 02:39:22,250
All right, let me get back to where I was.

1811
02:39:22,250 --> 02:39:32,829
We don't need this much pasta.

1812
02:39:32,829 --> 02:39:34,389
I mean, we do because it's hamburger helper.

1813
02:39:34,389 --> 02:39:37,110
It's just shlop, that's all it is.

1814
02:39:37,110 --> 02:39:38,649
This will be enough.

1815
02:39:38,649 --> 02:39:41,309
Yeah, this is more than enough.

1816
02:39:41,309 --> 02:39:47,030
Go back to cooking this pasta.

1817
02:39:47,030 --> 02:39:49,690
Okay, here we go.

1818
02:39:49,690 --> 02:39:53,170
The game does not like this at all.

1819
02:39:53,170 --> 02:39:55,010
The game hates that there's that much pasta in there.

1820
02:39:55,010 --> 02:39:57,549
Okay, now let's continue.

1821
02:39:57,549 --> 02:40:02,719
Get our milk in there.

1822
02:40:02,719 --> 02:40:06,479
That's a lot, but it's okay.

1823
02:40:06,479 --> 02:40:17,260
Where's our cheese?

1824
02:40:17,260 --> 02:40:19,290
Is that gonna melt?

1825
02:40:19,290 --> 02:40:22,510
Does the cheese melt in this game?

1826
02:40:22,510 --> 02:40:25,920
I don't know, does the cheese melt?

1827
02:40:25,920 --> 02:40:37,739
I need another pan, please.

1828
02:40:37,739 --> 02:40:42,559
Oh no, it's melting, it is.

1829
02:40:42,559 --> 02:40:44,000
Turn it on, dude.

1830
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:45,600
What are you doing?

1831
02:40:45,600 --> 02:40:48,950
Turn it on.

1832
02:40:48,950 --> 02:40:57,840
That our ground beef

1833
02:40:57,840 --> 02:41:13,159
and you just wanna get this to brown.

1834
02:41:13,159 --> 02:41:16,719
You just want it to brown a little bit.

1835
02:41:17,639 --> 02:41:23,520
Okay, what are you doing?

1836
02:41:23,520 --> 02:41:28,180
Is this cooking?

1837
02:41:28,180 --> 02:41:34,079
What's going on?

1838
02:41:34,079 --> 02:41:35,760
Okay, there we go.

1839
02:41:35,760 --> 02:41:38,079
Let that cook for a little longer.

1840
02:41:38,079 --> 02:41:46,680
Our pasta and our cheese sauce is here.

1841
02:41:46,680 --> 02:41:48,799
I also like to add a little bit of onion.

1842
02:41:48,799 --> 02:42:06,809
If you haven't, what's in here?

1843
02:42:06,809 --> 02:42:08,209
Some of these pieces need to be moved around

1844
02:42:08,209 --> 02:42:09,049
because they're gonna cook.

1845
02:42:09,049 --> 02:42:10,250
You gotta mush them up.

1846
02:42:10,250 --> 02:42:11,569
You gotta break it up with a fork

1847
02:42:11,569 --> 02:42:17,860
or break it up with a utensil.

1848
02:42:17,860 --> 02:42:19,459
Some of them are not gonna cook completely evenly,

1849
02:42:19,459 --> 02:42:22,059
but that's okay.

1850
02:42:22,059 --> 02:42:23,659
They'll finish off in the other pan we're gonna use,

1851
02:42:23,659 --> 02:42:27,280
which by the way, I need one.

1852
02:42:27,280 --> 02:42:34,299
It's just cook, fucking cook already, cook.

1853
02:42:34,459 --> 02:42:38,200
Okay, I need a saucepan.

1854
02:42:38,200 --> 02:42:42,510
Just like a deep kind of saucepan.

1855
02:42:42,510 --> 02:42:43,350
The game really hates

1856
02:42:43,350 --> 02:42:45,510
that there's that much macaroni in there.

1857
02:42:45,510 --> 02:42:48,569
Hates it.

1858
02:42:48,569 --> 02:42:50,090
Big pot.

1859
02:42:50,090 --> 02:42:55,079
Bake tray, blowtorch, bucket.

1860
02:42:55,079 --> 02:42:57,200
No, no, no, grill pan.

1861
02:42:57,200 --> 02:42:59,049
Is this what I need?

1862
02:42:59,049 --> 02:43:04,280
No, I already have one of those.

1863
02:43:04,280 --> 02:43:05,280
Paella pan?

1864
02:43:08,370 --> 02:43:09,569
Okay, it'll do, it'll work.

1865
02:43:09,569 --> 02:43:14,530
It'll do, it'll do.

1866
02:43:14,530 --> 02:43:17,600
So we're just gonna set this one here on low.

1867
02:43:17,600 --> 02:43:20,040
Don't want it to be too bad.

1868
02:43:20,040 --> 02:43:21,959
Is it on?

1869
02:43:21,959 --> 02:43:25,079
Okay.

1870
02:43:25,079 --> 02:43:26,760
Oh no.

1871
02:43:26,760 --> 02:43:27,600
Oh no.

1872
02:43:27,600 --> 02:43:37,399
It's okay, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right.

1873
02:43:37,399 --> 02:43:44,510
Then we're gonna take our pasta mixture with the cheese sauce

1874
02:43:44,510 --> 02:43:48,879
and there's our hamburger helper.

1875
02:43:48,879 --> 02:44:00,680
Gotta stir it up a little bit though.

1876
02:44:00,680 --> 02:44:06,510
Remember, this is the cheeseburger macaroni version.

1877
02:44:06,510 --> 02:44:09,340
We can turn that off and we can get this.

1878
02:44:09,340 --> 02:44:10,819
We can scoop this out onto a plate now.

1879
02:44:10,819 --> 02:44:11,659
There it is.

1880
02:44:11,659 --> 02:44:13,319
Looks pretty good.

1881
02:44:13,319 --> 02:44:15,040
If you want to grate a little bit of cheese on top,

1882
02:44:15,040 --> 02:44:16,840
that's up to you.

1883
02:44:16,840 --> 02:44:21,590
That's completely up to you.

1884
02:44:21,590 --> 02:44:22,430
But there it is.

1885
02:44:22,430 --> 02:44:24,329
There's our cheeseburger mac.

1886
02:44:24,329 --> 02:44:36,760
We need that deep plate here.

1887
02:44:36,760 --> 02:44:38,729
Okay.

1888
02:44:39,170 --> 02:44:48,920
Oh, this is a two-hander.

1889
02:44:48,920 --> 02:44:51,069
And there it is.

1890
02:44:51,069 --> 02:44:51,909
There it is.

1891
02:44:58,829 --> 02:44:59,670
Mess.

1892
02:45:01,149 --> 02:45:03,600
You know what's kind of funny?

1893
02:45:03,600 --> 02:45:06,799
I feel like over the course of my life,

1894
02:45:06,799 --> 02:45:10,239
I feel like I have seen this exact image.

1895
02:45:10,239 --> 02:45:11,360
When if you make a bunch of food

1896
02:45:11,360 --> 02:45:13,479
that's really, really kind of a pain in the ass to make

1897
02:45:13,479 --> 02:45:16,200
or it gets really messy,

1898
02:45:16,200 --> 02:45:20,500
I've left it like this for hours at a time.

1899
02:45:20,500 --> 02:45:23,579
I have like spilled, dumped, and gotten it like there

1900
02:45:23,579 --> 02:45:26,100
where it's like, I got two servings maybe.

1901
02:45:26,100 --> 02:45:28,540
And I just leave that shit until, you know what?

1902
02:45:28,540 --> 02:45:29,940
Like I could, but I want to eat.

1903
02:45:29,940 --> 02:45:30,780
And then, you know what?

1904
02:45:30,780 --> 02:45:32,469
I kind of want to watch TV.

1905
02:45:32,469 --> 02:45:35,639
So it just stays there for like two or three hours.

1906
02:45:35,639 --> 02:45:37,559
And then eventually, finally, you're like, you know what?

1907
02:45:37,559 --> 02:45:40,959
I probably should, they're adhered to the counter.

1908
02:45:40,959 --> 02:45:43,020
So it's probably time to take them up.

1909
02:45:43,020 --> 02:45:43,860
You know what?

1910
02:45:43,860 --> 02:45:47,719
You're like, okay, there's a little bit of give there.

1911
02:45:47,719 --> 02:45:53,739
And you clean the counter and everything.

1912
02:45:53,739 --> 02:45:57,989
Oh, oh, oh, it smells so good.

1913
02:45:57,989 --> 02:46:20,280
Now we're going to make a pot roast.

1914
02:46:20,280 --> 02:46:21,120
You good?

1915
02:46:21,120 --> 02:46:22,659
Yeah.

1916
02:46:23,379 --> 02:46:24,819
Boil it in the cheese water.

1917
02:46:26,979 --> 02:46:41,440
What you want to do is you want to brown it a little bit.

1918
02:46:41,440 --> 02:46:50,069
Are you going to put the au jus on top?

1919
02:46:50,069 --> 02:46:51,110
How do I restart?

1920
02:46:51,110 --> 02:46:51,950
I want to restart.

1921
02:46:51,950 --> 02:46:57,870
I want to do another one.

1922
02:46:57,870 --> 02:46:58,709
Boil it.

1923
02:46:58,709 --> 02:46:59,549
Okay.

1924
02:46:59,549 --> 02:47:02,030
I want to see what happens if you take a pot roast

1925
02:47:02,030 --> 02:47:03,569
and you put it in the microwave for 15 minutes.

1926
02:47:03,569 --> 02:47:07,909
What happens?

1927
02:47:07,909 --> 02:47:10,090
Is it like a Thanksgiving turkey

1928
02:47:10,090 --> 02:47:13,239
that I can put in the microwave?

1929
02:47:13,239 --> 02:47:20,969
I hope so.

1930
02:47:20,969 --> 02:47:24,040
It is beef chuck.

1931
02:47:24,040 --> 02:47:24,979
Okay.

1932
02:47:24,979 --> 02:47:29,639
What about like full turkey?

1933
02:47:29,639 --> 02:47:31,120
I could make like a hamburger too.

1934
02:47:31,120 --> 02:47:31,959
Yeah.

1935
02:47:31,959 --> 02:47:32,799
I want to make a burger for you guys.

1936
02:47:32,799 --> 02:47:35,590
I want to make my,

1937
02:47:35,590 --> 02:47:37,750
I'm going to make you guys two,

1938
02:47:37,750 --> 02:47:39,110
two or three of my favorite burgers.

1939
02:47:39,110 --> 02:47:41,950
And I'm not kidding.

1940
02:47:41,950 --> 02:47:44,549
It's just her Holly laugh.

1941
02:47:44,549 --> 02:47:46,899
I just heard her laugh.

1942
02:47:46,899 --> 02:47:48,899
What, what, what ha what my burger?

1943
02:47:48,899 --> 02:47:53,170
You don't like my burgers?

1944
02:47:53,170 --> 02:47:54,290
She pretends to like them.

1945
02:47:54,290 --> 02:47:56,649
Okay.

1946
02:47:59,440 --> 02:48:00,280
Okay.

1947
02:48:00,280 --> 02:48:03,219
So I'm going to make him three of my favorite hamburgers.

1948
02:48:03,219 --> 02:48:06,430
We're going to need that pan.

1949
02:48:06,430 --> 02:48:09,709
I have, I have pretty, pretty interesting burgers

1950
02:48:09,709 --> 02:48:11,040
that I like.

1951
02:48:11,040 --> 02:48:12,870
It's my go-tos.

1952
02:48:12,870 --> 02:48:15,319
We'll see how you guys like them.

1953
02:48:15,319 --> 02:48:19,979
First of all, we need cheese.

1954
02:48:19,979 --> 02:48:24,899
I need lettuce.

1955
02:48:24,899 --> 02:48:29,270
Wait, I got a corn on the cob.

1956
02:48:29,270 --> 02:48:30,110
Holy shit.

1957
02:48:30,110 --> 02:48:32,799
I'll use it for later.

1958
02:48:32,799 --> 02:48:34,440
No, I, I know I'm not one of those people

1959
02:48:34,440 --> 02:48:35,440
that's going to put an egg on it.

1960
02:48:35,440 --> 02:48:36,280
So don't worry.

1961
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:42,840
Okay.

1962
02:48:44,959 --> 02:48:45,799
Very nice.

1963
02:48:45,799 --> 02:48:49,739
Just need one.

1964
02:48:49,739 --> 02:48:53,680
I need like, can I chop up these onions?

1965
02:48:53,680 --> 02:48:59,549
I can chop the onions, right?

1966
02:48:59,549 --> 02:49:02,079
Couple of onions.

1967
02:49:02,079 --> 02:49:05,479
Uh, no, no, no, no.

1968
02:49:05,479 --> 02:49:06,479
Wait, how big is this?

1969
02:49:06,479 --> 02:49:07,319
All right.

1970
02:49:07,319 --> 02:49:08,139
That's huge.

1971
02:49:08,139 --> 02:49:10,709
We're going to put that in the microwave as well.

1972
02:49:10,709 --> 02:49:14,590
How big is this?

1973
02:49:14,909 --> 02:49:23,379
What is, that's weird.

1974
02:49:23,379 --> 02:49:24,219
Okay.

1975
02:49:24,219 --> 02:49:25,040
Wait, I don't want cabbage.

1976
02:49:25,040 --> 02:49:29,120
I want lettuce.

1977
02:49:29,120 --> 02:49:31,200
Strawberry, T-bone, thyme twig.

1978
02:49:31,200 --> 02:49:32,040
No, no, no.

1979
02:49:32,040 --> 02:49:33,760
Where's lettuce?

1980
02:49:33,760 --> 02:49:41,440
Is lettuce a spice?

1981
02:49:41,440 --> 02:49:42,280
No.

1982
02:49:42,280 --> 02:49:47,879
Where the hell is it?

1983
02:49:47,879 --> 02:49:51,850
Is lettuce in the game?

1984
02:49:51,850 --> 02:49:54,819
I don't think lettuce is in the game.

1985
02:49:54,819 --> 02:49:59,940
Put eggs in the microwave.

1986
02:49:59,940 --> 02:50:01,479
Is jellyfish an herb?

1987
02:50:04,149 --> 02:50:04,989
Miscellaneous?

1988
02:50:04,989 --> 02:50:10,709
I don't, where, what would it be?

1989
02:50:10,709 --> 02:50:12,950
I don't think it's in the game.

1990
02:50:12,950 --> 02:50:27,190
Is cabbage, basil leaf, asparagus, bay leaf,

1991
02:50:27,190 --> 02:50:33,520
broccoli, chives, cilantro, cucumber, dill.

1992
02:50:33,959 --> 02:50:37,450
I do want to make a few eggs.

1993
02:50:37,450 --> 02:50:42,500
I'm just curious of how that worked.

1994
02:50:42,500 --> 02:50:43,700
Green bell pepper.

1995
02:50:43,700 --> 02:50:45,239
No, it's not here.

1996
02:50:45,239 --> 02:50:46,680
Mint, I could probably get mint leaf

1997
02:50:46,680 --> 02:50:49,319
and pretend it's lettuce.

1998
02:50:49,319 --> 02:50:51,799
All right, it's going to have to be the cabbage.

1999
02:50:51,799 --> 02:50:52,639
Yeah.

2000
02:50:52,639 --> 02:50:53,559
Unfortunately, it has to be the cabbage

2001
02:50:53,559 --> 02:50:59,069
because I can't, there's no lettuce.

2002
02:50:59,069 --> 02:51:02,729
No, it's not there.

2003
02:51:02,729 --> 02:51:04,979
What about sage leaf?

2004
02:51:04,979 --> 02:51:09,209
No, that doesn't look like lettuce.

2005
02:51:09,209 --> 02:51:10,129
It kind of does.

2006
02:51:10,129 --> 02:51:12,860
I need a lot of it though.

2007
02:51:12,860 --> 02:51:14,020
What happens if I chop this?

2008
02:51:14,020 --> 02:51:14,860
What is this?

2009
02:51:14,860 --> 02:51:20,920
Is it a brain the whole time?

2010
02:51:20,920 --> 02:51:24,020
The parsley leaves might look like lettuce.

2011
02:51:24,020 --> 02:51:24,879
Yeah, all right, okay, okay.

2012
02:51:24,879 --> 02:51:28,170
We're going to get a shitload of parsley leaves

2013
02:51:28,170 --> 02:51:29,649
because this looks kind of like lettuce

2014
02:51:29,649 --> 02:51:31,809
and that's all I'm looking for is the look.

2015
02:51:39,200 --> 02:51:40,840
Okay, that'll look like lettuce on the burger.

2016
02:51:40,840 --> 02:51:43,329
That's fine.

2017
02:51:43,329 --> 02:51:46,760
Romaine?

2018
02:51:46,760 --> 02:51:48,020
No, it's not there.

2019
02:51:48,020 --> 02:51:49,760
There's no romaine, man.

2020
02:51:49,760 --> 02:51:55,000
Okay, now I need, I need onions.

2021
02:51:55,000 --> 02:52:01,239
Okay, onions with mayo, with mayonnaise.

2022
02:52:01,239 --> 02:52:07,969
Is mayo in the game?

2023
02:52:07,969 --> 02:52:08,930
You don't have mayo?

2024
02:52:08,930 --> 02:52:11,329
You got like mustard, olive oil, milk.

2025
02:52:11,329 --> 02:52:14,370
There's no mayo?

2026
02:52:14,370 --> 02:52:18,000
What?

2027
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:18,840
Just make it.

2028
02:52:23,399 --> 02:52:28,379
Okay, I need oil.

2029
02:52:28,379 --> 02:52:29,819
What kind of oil is it?

2030
02:52:29,819 --> 02:52:35,479
It's olive oil, right?

2031
02:52:35,479 --> 02:52:47,770
Olive oil and eggs and just whip it up in vinegar, yeah.

2032
02:52:47,770 --> 02:53:05,469
All right, where are those eggs?

2033
02:53:05,469 --> 02:53:09,950
These eggs are huge.

2034
02:53:09,950 --> 02:53:15,299
Okay, where's the blender?

2035
02:53:15,299 --> 02:53:17,979
Over there.

2036
02:53:17,979 --> 02:53:21,059
We're going to make our own homemade mayonnaise?

2037
02:53:21,059 --> 02:53:25,239
Okay, where's the blender?

2038
02:53:25,239 --> 02:53:28,049
Where is it?

2039
02:53:28,049 --> 02:53:30,350
Where's the blender top thing?

2040
02:53:30,350 --> 02:53:36,440
Do I have to buy it?

2041
02:53:36,440 --> 02:53:37,420
This is the German meal.

2042
02:53:37,420 --> 02:53:41,549
I think I have to buy it, right?

2043
02:53:41,549 --> 02:53:42,950
Blender.

2044
02:53:45,100 --> 02:53:47,670
What the fuck is this?

2045
02:53:47,670 --> 02:53:54,219
What?

2046
02:53:54,219 --> 02:53:59,530
What is it called?

2047
02:53:59,530 --> 02:54:00,799
There we go.

2048
02:54:00,799 --> 02:54:09,860
Wait, where's the food processor?

2049
02:54:09,860 --> 02:54:10,799
Is that it?

2050
02:54:10,799 --> 02:54:16,799
Okay, all right.

2051
02:54:16,799 --> 02:54:29,299
We need oil, white vinegar.

2052
02:54:29,299 --> 02:54:32,430
I don't know how much I'm supposed to use.

2053
02:54:32,430 --> 02:54:35,219
And then I need my eggs.

2054
02:54:35,219 --> 02:54:39,459
That's going to be disgusting.

2055
02:54:39,459 --> 02:54:40,500
How many eggs do you put in?

2056
02:54:40,500 --> 02:54:43,379
How do you make mayonnaise?

2057
02:54:43,379 --> 02:54:48,239
Look, I'm making my secret patties for you guys.

2058
02:54:48,280 --> 02:54:52,799
Oops.

2059
02:54:52,799 --> 02:55:00,579
How does this work?

2060
02:55:00,579 --> 02:55:05,889
There are shells in here.

2061
02:55:05,889 --> 02:55:06,729
You know what?

2062
02:55:06,729 --> 02:55:07,569
It doesn't matter.

2063
02:55:07,569 --> 02:55:09,329
It's fine.

2064
02:55:09,329 --> 02:55:10,170
It'll be fine.

2065
02:55:10,170 --> 02:55:11,379
We got our eggs.

2066
02:55:11,379 --> 02:55:12,200
I need a few more.

2067
02:55:12,200 --> 02:55:13,040
What's happening?

2068
02:55:13,040 --> 02:55:18,709
I need more oil.

2069
02:55:18,709 --> 02:55:20,940
Shut up.

2070
02:55:20,940 --> 02:55:21,780
Okay.

2071
02:55:21,780 --> 02:55:41,850
I need a couple more eggs.

2072
02:55:41,850 --> 02:55:43,379
Okay.

2073
02:55:43,379 --> 02:55:46,750
Now we need a little bit of a kick.

2074
02:55:46,750 --> 02:55:52,209
I'm going to say, let's go to the spice rack.

2075
02:55:52,209 --> 02:55:53,510
And what do I want to put in here?

2076
02:55:53,510 --> 02:55:56,719
I want to put in some things here.

2077
02:55:56,719 --> 02:56:07,610
Pepper, a little bit of garlic.

2078
02:56:07,610 --> 02:56:09,489
Oh, yo.

2079
02:56:09,489 --> 02:56:12,600
Hold on a second.

2080
02:56:13,440 --> 02:56:18,229
Hold on a minute.

2081
02:56:18,229 --> 02:56:19,049
Okay.

2082
02:56:19,049 --> 02:56:25,329
I want some garlic, garlic.

2083
02:56:25,329 --> 02:56:29,530
I want like two things of garlic.

2084
02:56:29,530 --> 02:56:32,149
And then I think that that's all right.

2085
02:56:32,149 --> 02:56:37,149
Maybe a little bit, maybe a little bit of salt.

2086
02:56:37,149 --> 02:56:37,989
Okay.

2087
02:56:37,989 --> 02:56:38,829
I think that's going to be fine.

2088
02:56:38,829 --> 02:56:39,670
That's easy.

2089
02:56:39,670 --> 02:56:46,889
Get this on the food processor and let's begin.

2090
02:56:46,889 --> 02:56:55,420
As our fresh mayo.

2091
02:56:55,420 --> 02:56:59,040
Let's try it.

2092
02:56:59,040 --> 02:57:07,819
Thickness seems pretty good.

2093
02:57:07,819 --> 02:57:08,659
That's all right.

2094
02:57:08,659 --> 02:57:10,290
That's good.

2095
02:57:10,290 --> 02:57:14,700
We've got our mayo.

2096
02:57:14,700 --> 02:57:16,079
I can sit right here.

2097
02:57:16,079 --> 02:57:16,920
Don't have to do anything else with that.

2098
02:57:16,920 --> 02:57:18,040
I think it's stay there for now.

2099
02:57:18,040 --> 02:57:21,510
That's considered room temp.

2100
02:57:21,510 --> 02:57:22,469
You made paint thinner.

2101
02:57:22,469 --> 02:57:23,370
It's mayonnaise.

2102
02:57:23,370 --> 02:57:24,209
Just relax.

2103
02:57:24,209 --> 02:57:26,739
Why everybody hates mayonnaise so much?

2104
02:57:26,739 --> 02:57:27,579
You like eggs.

2105
02:57:27,579 --> 02:57:29,770
You like oil.

2106
02:57:29,770 --> 02:57:31,930
You like like creaminess.

2107
02:57:31,930 --> 02:57:33,329
So what's the problem?

2108
02:57:33,329 --> 02:57:35,690
Oh, mayo, gross.

2109
02:57:35,690 --> 02:57:41,229
I don't get what the issue is.

2110
02:57:41,229 --> 02:57:44,459
What's the issue?

2111
02:57:44,459 --> 02:57:46,239
All right.

2112
02:57:46,239 --> 02:57:49,280
Let's make, let's cook these burgers up.

2113
02:57:49,280 --> 02:57:51,299
I am going to do my first burger.

2114
02:57:51,299 --> 02:57:52,590
Very simple.

2115
02:57:52,590 --> 02:57:54,510
There's nothing too crazy about it.

2116
02:57:54,510 --> 02:57:58,540
I need an onion.

2117
02:57:58,540 --> 02:58:02,540
This is my go-to though is a knife.

2118
02:58:02,540 --> 02:58:04,790
Thank you.

2119
02:58:04,790 --> 02:58:09,040
These onions have to be chopped fairly thin.

2120
02:58:09,040 --> 02:58:10,040
And then we have to cook these

2121
02:58:10,040 --> 02:58:11,059
because they need to be grilled onions.

2122
02:58:11,059 --> 02:58:27,770
They have to be grilled onions.

2123
02:58:27,770 --> 02:58:30,170
I like them nice and chopped and thin.

2124
02:58:30,170 --> 02:58:32,440
Get away from me.

2125
02:58:32,440 --> 02:58:40,430
Get away from me.

2126
02:58:40,430 --> 02:58:41,270
That's all right.

2127
02:58:41,270 --> 02:58:44,569
You get the idea.

2128
02:58:44,569 --> 02:58:46,110
Because I can't seem to cut these any more

2129
02:58:46,110 --> 02:58:54,889
than I already have.

2130
02:58:54,889 --> 02:58:55,729
All right.

2131
02:58:55,729 --> 02:58:57,200
You get the idea.

2132
02:58:57,200 --> 02:58:58,319
These are our onions.

2133
02:58:58,319 --> 02:59:01,270
Let's go ahead and start sweating those out.

2134
02:59:01,270 --> 02:59:15,479
Let's go ahead and start sweating those out guys.

2135
02:59:15,479 --> 02:59:16,319
Okay.

2136
02:59:16,319 --> 02:59:22,270
Let's go ahead and start sweating those out.

2137
02:59:22,270 --> 02:59:23,809
Once those are done sweating a little bit,

2138
02:59:23,809 --> 02:59:28,069
you just want to let them breathe a little.

2139
02:59:28,069 --> 02:59:30,879
Give them a shake.

2140
02:59:30,879 --> 02:59:40,139
Once those are ready, we can move on to the next step.

2141
02:59:40,139 --> 02:59:42,059
Oh, excellent.

2142
02:59:45,510 --> 02:59:46,350
Those are good to go.

2143
02:59:46,350 --> 02:59:47,170
Those are good to go.

2144
02:59:47,170 --> 02:59:49,399
Get them off.

2145
02:59:49,399 --> 02:59:50,219
Okay.

2146
02:59:50,219 --> 02:59:51,370
We've got our grilled onions.

2147
02:59:51,370 --> 02:59:52,469
I need a little bit of oil for this pan

2148
02:59:52,469 --> 02:59:56,370
so I can get these, one of these burgers going by the way.

2149
02:59:56,370 --> 02:59:57,209
Rare.

2150
02:59:57,209 --> 02:59:58,030
No.

2151
02:59:58,030 --> 02:59:58,870
Medium rare.

2152
02:59:58,870 --> 02:59:59,690
No.

2153
02:59:59,690 --> 03:00:01,540
We do medium in this house.

2154
03:00:01,540 --> 03:00:03,680
This is a medium household.

2155
03:00:03,680 --> 03:00:05,319
I don't even know if I'm talking to you.

2156
03:00:05,319 --> 03:00:07,129
I probably am not.

2157
03:00:07,129 --> 03:00:08,389
I'm a, yeah, I am.

2158
03:00:08,389 --> 03:00:11,989
This is, I'm a medium household.

2159
03:00:11,989 --> 03:00:14,360
I do not do medium rare.

2160
03:00:14,360 --> 03:00:16,040
No, we do not do that here.

2161
03:00:16,040 --> 03:00:18,200
Oops.

2162
03:00:21,030 --> 03:00:29,270
I need oil.

2163
03:00:29,270 --> 03:00:31,129
I just need some olive oil.

2164
03:00:31,129 --> 03:00:31,969
Oh, you know what?

2165
03:00:32,610 --> 03:00:33,450
Let's go butter.

2166
03:00:33,450 --> 03:00:34,270
Yeah.

2167
03:00:34,270 --> 03:00:35,350
Let's go butter.

2168
03:00:35,350 --> 03:00:36,190
Hell yeah.

2169
03:00:36,190 --> 03:00:38,389
This is making me want a burger now.

2170
03:00:38,389 --> 03:00:39,229
Clarified butter.

2171
03:00:39,229 --> 03:00:40,069
You have, my God.

2172
03:00:40,069 --> 03:00:41,270
You gotta be kidding me, dude.

2173
03:00:41,270 --> 03:00:42,110
Oh man.

2174
03:00:42,110 --> 03:00:43,430
I want a burger now.

2175
03:00:43,430 --> 03:00:50,110
Let's do burgers.

2176
03:00:50,110 --> 03:00:53,360
Okay.

2177
03:00:53,360 --> 03:01:02,600
That's, that's it.

2178
03:01:02,600 --> 03:01:03,440
Okay.

2179
03:01:03,440 --> 03:01:04,260
That's good.

2180
03:01:04,260 --> 03:01:05,100
Good, good, good.

2181
03:01:05,100 --> 03:01:07,559
Now we're gonna, I'm gonna do, I'm putting in,

2182
03:01:07,559 --> 03:01:10,180
I need some, give me that.

2183
03:01:10,180 --> 03:01:11,860
No, not the mayonnaise.

2184
03:01:11,860 --> 03:01:14,920
I don't want the mayo.

2185
03:01:14,920 --> 03:01:16,280
Let's season it really nicely.

2186
03:01:16,280 --> 03:01:21,399
It's good.

2187
03:01:21,399 --> 03:01:23,110
A little bit of salt too.

2188
03:01:23,110 --> 03:01:27,450
And you know, I'm feeling a little weird today.

2189
03:01:28,290 --> 03:01:31,809
We're going with, what do we want?

2190
03:01:31,809 --> 03:01:32,649
No, no, no, no, no.

2191
03:01:32,649 --> 03:01:38,219
I want like, I want, I want like coriander or something.

2192
03:01:38,219 --> 03:01:39,059
Right?

2193
03:01:39,059 --> 03:01:41,629
So I look, so people think I'm like really smart.

2194
03:01:41,629 --> 03:01:43,030
Oh, what do you put on your burgers?

2195
03:01:43,030 --> 03:01:46,870
Oh, well, salt, pepper, garlic, a coriander, cumin,

2196
03:01:46,870 --> 03:01:47,790
a little bit of thyme.

2197
03:01:47,790 --> 03:01:50,229
And oh, this person's really knows what they're doing.

2198
03:01:50,229 --> 03:01:51,950
They understand the kitchen very well.

2199
03:01:51,950 --> 03:01:54,219
Oh, they know what they're doing.

2200
03:01:54,219 --> 03:01:55,979
No, people that say all that shit,

2201
03:01:55,979 --> 03:01:58,690
they just put it, you can't even taste it.

2202
03:01:58,690 --> 03:02:01,729
Like, oh, well, it's a mixture I use of thyme, rosemary,

2203
03:02:01,729 --> 03:02:04,770
cumin, coriander, cilantro.

2204
03:02:04,770 --> 03:02:06,569
It's like, they're just saying those things

2205
03:02:06,569 --> 03:02:08,809
to make you think that they're like a chef.

2206
03:02:08,809 --> 03:02:10,709
You can't even taste any of that shit.

2207
03:02:10,709 --> 03:02:13,389
But it's like, it's like, it's mac and cheese, dude.

2208
03:02:13,389 --> 03:02:18,020
Like you can't even taste that.

2209
03:02:18,020 --> 03:02:19,860
It's like, you're not going to be able to eat.

2210
03:02:19,860 --> 03:02:24,700
It's just going to taste like cheese and pasta.

2211
03:02:24,700 --> 03:02:28,139
What is this?

2212
03:02:28,139 --> 03:02:31,329
What is it?

2213
03:02:31,329 --> 03:02:32,700
Catnip?

2214
03:02:32,700 --> 03:02:35,700
No, no mint.

2215
03:02:35,700 --> 03:02:40,469
I'll do some white pepper and lavash.

2216
03:02:40,469 --> 03:02:41,670
Oh yeah, yeah.

2217
03:02:41,670 --> 03:02:45,479
How about some lavash, man?

2218
03:02:45,479 --> 03:02:47,680
No, I want, I want like onion powder.

2219
03:02:47,680 --> 03:02:51,729
Here we go, garlic powder.

2220
03:02:51,729 --> 03:03:04,420
I'm a big fan of garlic.

2221
03:03:04,420 --> 03:03:07,010
Ooh, I love this shit.

2222
03:03:07,010 --> 03:03:11,569
All right, I need salt and then I'm ready to grill.

2223
03:03:11,569 --> 03:03:18,340
Ooh, let's use this with salt.

2224
03:03:18,340 --> 03:03:19,700
Okay, can you just pretend I put salt on it?

2225
03:03:19,700 --> 03:03:20,540
Who cares?

2226
03:03:20,540 --> 03:03:22,969
Because like, wait, there it is.

2227
03:03:22,969 --> 03:03:25,510
Is this salt or is this like whipped cream?

2228
03:03:25,510 --> 03:03:26,780
What is this?

2229
03:03:26,780 --> 03:03:30,290
Whatever.

2230
03:03:30,290 --> 03:03:33,909
Oh guys, you know what would be so sick right now?

2231
03:03:33,909 --> 03:03:37,750
If I put some truffle powder on it.

2232
03:03:37,750 --> 03:03:38,909
Nobody eats that stuff.

2233
03:03:38,909 --> 03:03:45,889
You eat that when you go to a restaurant.

2234
03:03:45,889 --> 03:03:47,930
Yeah, they go, oh, hey, do you want the truffle this?

2235
03:03:47,930 --> 03:03:48,770
You want the truffle mac?

2236
03:03:49,329 --> 03:03:50,170
You want the truffle fries?

2237
03:03:50,170 --> 03:03:50,989
You want the truffle?

2238
03:03:50,989 --> 03:03:52,209
You just nod your head and go, okay,

2239
03:03:52,209 --> 03:03:53,489
thanks for the four extra dollars

2240
03:03:53,489 --> 03:03:56,510
you're gonna charge me for these now.

2241
03:03:56,510 --> 03:03:58,219
Are you ready?

2242
03:03:58,219 --> 03:03:59,579
It's time to begin the grilling.

2243
03:03:59,579 --> 03:04:01,340
Oh, we're not using that.

2244
03:04:01,340 --> 03:04:12,500
We're using this.

2245
03:04:12,500 --> 03:04:13,899
Three minutes aside.

2246
03:04:13,899 --> 03:04:16,899
Sometimes three, after you do three minutes aside,

2247
03:04:16,899 --> 03:04:19,620
it's very important that you second guess the shit

2248
03:04:19,620 --> 03:04:21,780
out of yourself over and over again.

2249
03:04:21,780 --> 03:04:24,459
And you do three minutes aside, then you panic.

2250
03:04:24,459 --> 03:04:26,420
And then you squish the fuck out of it

2251
03:04:26,420 --> 03:04:28,760
because you're terrified of getting sick.

2252
03:04:28,760 --> 03:04:30,600
And then you flip it five more times.

2253
03:04:30,639 --> 03:04:42,500
So it ends up being about six minutes aside.

2254
03:04:42,500 --> 03:04:46,719
What's wrong with this?

2255
03:04:46,719 --> 03:04:51,979
Why is this made out of tofu?

2256
03:04:51,979 --> 03:04:53,620
It's not supposed to look like that.

2257
03:04:53,620 --> 03:04:54,459
What's wrong with this?

2258
03:04:54,459 --> 03:04:56,790
I want a new one.

2259
03:04:56,790 --> 03:05:00,989
That's not supposed to look like that.

2260
03:05:00,989 --> 03:05:03,469
That's not supposed to look like that.

2261
03:05:03,469 --> 03:05:18,680
Salt, pepper, fish eggs, whatever the fuck this was.

2262
03:05:19,709 --> 03:05:24,520
And oh, you guys can't forget the garlic powder.

2263
03:05:24,520 --> 03:05:29,850
You can't forget the garlic.

2264
03:05:29,850 --> 03:05:31,209
Okay, now it's ready.

2265
03:05:31,610 --> 03:05:38,719
Now it's ready.

2266
03:05:38,719 --> 03:05:48,739
Now what you're looking for is looking for a little sear.

2267
03:05:48,739 --> 03:05:52,239
Three minutes aside.

2268
03:05:52,239 --> 03:06:01,809
Anybody else sit here while this is happening

2269
03:06:01,809 --> 03:06:03,569
and they freak out.

2270
03:06:03,569 --> 03:06:06,079
You just go like this.

2271
03:06:06,079 --> 03:06:06,920
Oh, I don't know.

2272
03:06:06,920 --> 03:06:07,760
I don't know.

2273
03:06:07,760 --> 03:06:08,579
I don't know.

2274
03:06:08,579 --> 03:06:09,420
I don't know.

2275
03:06:09,420 --> 03:06:14,079
And then it starts to smell more than cooked meat.

2276
03:06:14,079 --> 03:06:15,680
It starts to get kind of a different smell.

2277
03:06:15,680 --> 03:06:16,799
And you're like, I don't know if it's supposed

2278
03:06:16,799 --> 03:06:17,639
to smell like that.

2279
03:06:17,639 --> 03:06:18,959
It's burning.

2280
03:06:18,959 --> 03:06:21,940
And you freak out and flip it in like a minute.

2281
03:06:21,940 --> 03:06:26,819
I'm not a noob.

2282
03:06:26,819 --> 03:06:33,610
Is this on high?

2283
03:06:33,729 --> 03:06:41,639
Is this on high?

2284
03:06:41,639 --> 03:06:47,069
Perfect.

2285
03:06:47,069 --> 03:06:52,309
Perfect.

2286
03:06:52,309 --> 03:06:53,790
You only seasoned one side.

2287
03:06:57,549 --> 03:07:00,270
All right, now we squish the fuck out of it.

2288
03:07:00,270 --> 03:07:03,600
Squish it.

2289
03:07:03,600 --> 03:07:04,940
Oh, this looks really good.

2290
03:07:16,129 --> 03:07:16,969
What happened?

2291
03:07:16,969 --> 03:07:24,639
Why is it white powder all over it now?

2292
03:07:34,930 --> 03:07:37,670
Oh, don't forget this.

2293
03:07:37,670 --> 03:07:39,510
Don't forget this.

2294
03:07:39,510 --> 03:07:43,520
The weeds from your backyard.

2295
03:07:43,520 --> 03:07:44,500
Whatever that is.

2296
03:07:49,610 --> 03:07:51,329
It's almost ready.

2297
03:07:51,329 --> 03:07:53,569
Oh my God, dude.

2298
03:07:53,569 --> 03:07:56,280
If you could smell that right now.

2299
03:07:56,280 --> 03:07:58,520
Oh my God.

2300
03:07:58,520 --> 03:07:59,840
That smells so good.

2301
03:07:59,840 --> 03:08:02,590
It's just filling the whole house with it.

2302
03:08:02,590 --> 03:08:05,610
Oh man.

2303
03:08:05,610 --> 03:08:06,950
Oh my God.

2304
03:08:06,950 --> 03:08:12,069
It smells so good, dude.

2305
03:08:12,069 --> 03:08:13,270
Are you kidding me?

2306
03:08:16,819 --> 03:08:18,180
It's like alien meat.

2307
03:08:21,819 --> 03:08:24,520
Mom, are you cooking burgers down there?

2308
03:08:24,520 --> 03:08:25,719
That's right, son.

2309
03:08:25,719 --> 03:08:27,600
Oh, it smells so good down here.

2310
03:08:32,540 --> 03:08:38,799
All right, that's almost done.

2311
03:08:38,799 --> 03:08:41,100
We got a perfectly cooked medium patty

2312
03:08:41,100 --> 03:08:44,440
with, I don't know, like a cocaine on it.

2313
03:08:44,440 --> 03:08:46,079
Sit it right there.

2314
03:08:46,079 --> 03:08:47,639
Nice.

2315
03:08:47,639 --> 03:08:49,719
It's like, it's okay.

2316
03:08:49,719 --> 03:08:51,639
A bird shit on it, but I think it's gonna be fine.

2317
03:08:51,639 --> 03:08:56,120
It still will taste good.

2318
03:08:56,120 --> 03:08:59,819
What was that?

2319
03:08:59,819 --> 03:09:00,659
What was that?

2320
03:09:00,659 --> 03:09:01,500
What was that?

2321
03:09:01,500 --> 03:09:02,950
What was that?

2322
03:09:02,950 --> 03:09:03,790
What was, what was it?

2323
03:09:03,790 --> 03:09:09,010
It was just flying.

2324
03:09:09,010 --> 03:09:10,809
All right, we got our burger here.

2325
03:09:10,809 --> 03:09:11,790
I wanna brush that off.

2326
03:09:11,790 --> 03:09:13,530
I don't know what that is.

2327
03:09:13,530 --> 03:09:18,579
Oh, don't forget the grilled onions.

2328
03:09:18,579 --> 03:09:24,590
Shut up.

2329
03:09:24,790 --> 03:09:26,250
I need a burger patty.

2330
03:09:26,250 --> 03:09:28,860
Burger, whatever it is.

2331
03:09:28,860 --> 03:09:30,219
It's the, you put starch on it?

2332
03:09:30,219 --> 03:09:32,260
What?

2333
03:09:32,260 --> 03:09:33,719
I put starch, Starch Andy.

2334
03:09:36,079 --> 03:09:39,149
I'm going fucking, I'm being weird.

2335
03:09:39,149 --> 03:09:41,790
I'll put some corn.

2336
03:09:41,790 --> 03:09:44,920
I'm trying to throw it onto the grill.

2337
03:09:44,920 --> 03:09:52,340
All right, where, give me that.

2338
03:09:52,340 --> 03:09:59,209
Hamburger bun.

2339
03:09:59,209 --> 03:10:05,180
Where's burger bun?

2340
03:10:05,180 --> 03:10:08,360
Burger bun, AB?

2341
03:10:08,360 --> 03:10:15,299
Burger meat, burger bun.

2342
03:10:15,299 --> 03:10:21,040
Why is it two tops?

2343
03:10:21,040 --> 03:10:27,040
What?

2344
03:10:27,040 --> 03:10:27,860
Okay, well, whatever.

2345
03:10:27,860 --> 03:10:28,700
It's two tops.

2346
03:10:28,700 --> 03:10:29,540
I don't, I didn't know.

2347
03:10:29,540 --> 03:10:31,180
I don't know why that happened.

2348
03:10:31,180 --> 03:10:33,389
Let's start assembling the burger.

2349
03:10:33,389 --> 03:10:34,370
Remember this, I'm not kidding.

2350
03:10:34,370 --> 03:10:38,159
This is my favorite burger, or one of them.

2351
03:10:38,159 --> 03:10:47,709
We'll go like this, start here, like that.

2352
03:10:47,709 --> 03:10:49,870
That gets us to, let me make sure

2353
03:10:49,870 --> 03:10:51,750
I look at you the right way.

2354
03:10:51,750 --> 03:10:53,629
This is a puke inducing turn.

2355
03:10:53,629 --> 03:10:55,299
I'm so sorry.

2356
03:10:55,299 --> 03:10:56,700
All right, let's get the onions on there.

2357
03:10:56,700 --> 03:11:09,440
These are grilled onions.

2358
03:11:09,440 --> 03:11:11,139
Dude, I don't even have any cheese.

2359
03:11:11,139 --> 03:11:18,239
What?

2360
03:11:18,239 --> 03:11:19,340
All right, you get the idea.

2361
03:11:19,340 --> 03:11:21,090
There's the grilled onions.

2362
03:11:21,090 --> 03:11:25,430
I need my lettuce, which is, I don't know where it is.

2363
03:11:25,430 --> 03:11:28,319
Just turn, this is like, this joke is not funny.

2364
03:11:28,319 --> 03:11:30,940
It's just an annoying sound.

2365
03:11:30,940 --> 03:11:31,979
All right, where's my lettuce?

2366
03:11:31,979 --> 03:11:32,819
It's over here.

2367
03:11:32,819 --> 03:11:37,440
This is the pretend lettuce, right?

2368
03:11:37,440 --> 03:11:38,280
Shit.

2369
03:11:39,120 --> 03:11:42,040
I need to make this over here.

2370
03:11:42,040 --> 03:11:45,799
Grilled onions, lettuce.

2371
03:11:45,799 --> 03:11:51,420
Can I reach it from here?

2372
03:11:51,420 --> 03:11:58,219
You have to pretend this is lettuce.

2373
03:11:58,219 --> 03:12:09,469
Grilled onions, lettuce, a little bit of mayo, okay?

2374
03:12:09,469 --> 03:12:12,329
Mayo, lettuce, grilled onions, cheese.

2375
03:12:12,329 --> 03:12:19,219
I don't think I have any cheese here so far.

2376
03:12:19,219 --> 03:12:20,059
A little.

2377
03:12:21,059 --> 03:12:24,780
I mean, I'm trying to make it look like it was on there.

2378
03:12:24,780 --> 03:12:28,780
And then cheese, just cheddar cheese.

2379
03:12:28,780 --> 03:12:30,979
Cheddar cheese is fine, although Swiss would be good too.

2380
03:12:30,979 --> 03:12:32,319
So, provolone.

2381
03:12:32,319 --> 03:12:36,409
Oh my God, I want a burger so bad now.

2382
03:12:36,409 --> 03:12:38,809
I'm gonna get the biggest, dirtiest burger

2383
03:12:38,809 --> 03:12:41,090
you've ever seen in your life.

2384
03:12:41,090 --> 03:12:50,510
Okay, I need to cut this.

2385
03:12:50,510 --> 03:12:54,569
Okay, that's good enough.

2386
03:12:54,569 --> 03:12:57,110
This is the burger right here.

2387
03:12:57,110 --> 03:13:01,930
Again, let's go over it.

2388
03:13:01,930 --> 03:13:04,159
Oh, look at that.

2389
03:13:04,159 --> 03:13:10,979
It's cumin, coriander, thyme, rosemary,

2390
03:13:10,979 --> 03:13:14,590
baked into the meat, put in beforehand.

2391
03:13:14,590 --> 03:13:18,430
It's gotta go into the ground, ground chuck, by the way.

2392
03:13:18,430 --> 03:13:21,870
No, it's grilled onions, lettuce, mayo, cheese,

2393
03:13:21,870 --> 03:13:24,030
burger patty, medium.

2394
03:13:24,030 --> 03:13:26,809
I don't think you need any more than that.

2395
03:13:26,809 --> 03:13:30,540
Can I cut it down the middle?

2396
03:13:30,540 --> 03:13:33,290
The other one, should I even make the other one?

2397
03:13:33,290 --> 03:13:50,430
Seriously, that didn't work.

2398
03:13:50,430 --> 03:13:53,520
You get the idea.

2399
03:13:53,520 --> 03:13:56,670
All right, the other one, I'm trying to cut it.

2400
03:13:56,670 --> 03:13:58,389
The other one is a little different.

2401
03:13:58,389 --> 03:14:02,270
The other one is grilled mushrooms, grilled onions,

2402
03:14:02,270 --> 03:14:05,450
provolone cheese, and A1 steak sauce.

2403
03:14:05,450 --> 03:14:10,799
I just pretend like I made that one for you.

2404
03:14:10,799 --> 03:14:18,270
Oh, you can cut it.

2405
03:14:18,270 --> 03:14:19,510
Next game, all right, we're gonna move on.

2406
03:14:19,510 --> 03:14:21,360
We'll do the next game.

2407
03:14:21,360 --> 03:14:23,440
Just start, all right, now it's time for the stream.

2408
03:14:23,440 --> 03:14:25,760
You know, the part that everybody thinks is funny.

2409
03:14:25,760 --> 03:14:28,040
Here we go, what's he gonna do now?

2410
03:14:28,040 --> 03:14:30,319
Oh my God, is he gonna put all this stuff

2411
03:14:30,319 --> 03:14:33,120
in the microwave and cause a fire?

2412
03:14:33,120 --> 03:14:39,379
I actually wanna do that.

2413
03:14:39,379 --> 03:15:06,659
Let's hear it, good.

2414
03:15:06,659 --> 03:15:10,870
Will this actually work?

2415
03:15:10,870 --> 03:15:12,709
All right, if you put something on top of a microwave,

2416
03:15:12,709 --> 03:15:24,569
will it get cooked like radiation style?

2417
03:15:24,569 --> 03:15:35,110
It's working.

2418
03:15:35,110 --> 03:15:38,030
Would this actually work?

2419
03:15:38,030 --> 03:15:39,030
Put the corn in the microwave?

2420
03:15:39,030 --> 03:15:47,270
Oh, that's not, that's a good idea.

2421
03:15:47,270 --> 03:15:48,420
Where's the corn?

2422
03:15:48,420 --> 03:15:52,040
Will it actually, will it pop?

2423
03:15:52,040 --> 03:15:55,680
Oh, it's dirty, I gotta get like this,

2424
03:15:55,680 --> 03:16:03,110
clean it up a little bit.

2425
03:16:03,110 --> 03:16:06,459
All right, that freaks me out with a microwave too.

2426
03:16:06,459 --> 03:16:08,100
When you're done and the microwave is,

2427
03:16:08,100 --> 03:16:09,700
okay, here's your food is ready,

2428
03:16:09,700 --> 03:16:11,719
and the food is ready.

2429
03:16:11,719 --> 03:16:12,680
I hate that.

2430
03:16:12,680 --> 03:16:13,959
This has to be residual,

2431
03:16:13,959 --> 03:16:17,610
like gamma rays in here and shit, right?

2432
03:16:17,610 --> 03:16:27,120
I don't, I wanted to sit there for like a good 10 seconds.

2433
03:16:27,120 --> 03:16:30,639
No, no.

2434
03:16:30,639 --> 03:16:31,840
Residual gamma rays?

2435
03:16:31,840 --> 03:16:34,829
I don't know, it's like, it feels weird.

2436
03:16:34,829 --> 03:16:38,930
I have talked about this more than a few times.

2437
03:16:38,930 --> 03:16:42,110
We always talk about, okay, like 50 years ago,

2438
03:16:42,110 --> 03:16:44,889
they thought that smoking cigarettes was healthy, right?

2439
03:16:44,889 --> 03:16:46,450
It was like not a big deal.

2440
03:16:46,489 --> 03:16:48,209
You know, a hundred years ago,

2441
03:16:48,209 --> 03:16:50,809
that every 50 to a hundred years,

2442
03:16:50,809 --> 03:16:53,170
we learn something new about humanity

2443
03:16:53,170 --> 03:16:55,809
that the next like three or four generations look back

2444
03:16:55,809 --> 03:16:59,430
and say, what the fuck were they doing, right?

2445
03:16:59,430 --> 03:17:03,950
I believe, I think the microwave is gonna be the thing

2446
03:17:03,950 --> 03:17:05,829
that in a hundred years,

2447
03:17:05,829 --> 03:17:07,389
people are gonna be looking back and going,

2448
03:17:07,389 --> 03:17:09,159
what were they doing?

2449
03:17:09,159 --> 03:17:13,290
They were zapping their food with radiation?

2450
03:17:13,290 --> 03:17:14,569
What, what?

2451
03:17:14,569 --> 03:17:16,250
No, they were not doing that, right?

2452
03:17:16,250 --> 03:17:19,989
Like it has to be.

2453
03:17:19,989 --> 03:17:21,350
Oh yeah, or plastic.

2454
03:17:21,350 --> 03:17:37,440
Yep, plastic could be another one.

2455
03:17:37,440 --> 03:17:40,379
Definitely plastic.

2456
03:17:40,379 --> 03:17:41,340
Okay, that's good.

2457
03:17:41,340 --> 03:17:44,559
This didn't do anything by the way.

2458
03:17:44,559 --> 03:17:52,770
I mean, it just turned it like a little orange.

2459
03:17:52,770 --> 03:17:54,889
All right, it's baking in the microwave, yay or nay.

2460
03:17:54,889 --> 03:17:56,979
What do you say?

2461
03:17:56,979 --> 03:17:58,719
Laying raw bacon in the microwave

2462
03:17:58,719 --> 03:18:05,079
and hitting the button, yay or nay.

2463
03:18:05,079 --> 03:18:15,639
I've seen it done before, not a big fan, not a fan.

2464
03:18:15,639 --> 03:18:17,079
Baking it is best.

2465
03:18:17,079 --> 03:18:21,809
You know, I used to really like putting it in the pan,

2466
03:18:21,809 --> 03:18:24,489
but you can only do a few strips in the pan at a time.

2467
03:18:24,489 --> 03:18:25,909
And that's a pain in the ass.

2468
03:18:25,909 --> 03:18:29,270
I prefer the taste of strips in the pan versus in the oven,

2469
03:18:29,270 --> 03:18:30,409
but you can do a whole pound

2470
03:18:30,409 --> 03:18:33,530
of two pounds of bacon in the oven.

2471
03:18:33,530 --> 03:18:38,159
It takes so long to cook it in a pan.

2472
03:18:38,159 --> 03:18:44,299
Get a griddle, dumb ass.

2473
03:18:44,299 --> 03:18:45,340
All right, let's, let's, let's move on.

2474
03:18:45,340 --> 03:18:47,579
Let's play another game.

2475
03:18:47,579 --> 03:18:49,680
Oh, I just want this.

2476
03:18:49,680 --> 03:18:55,930
I want this right now.

2477
03:18:55,930 --> 03:19:06,100
Oh wait, I didn't, I forgot to make a fire, okay.

2478
03:19:06,100 --> 03:19:16,129
How do I start a fire?

2479
03:19:16,129 --> 03:19:32,459
Okay, let's turn everything on, right?

2480
03:19:32,459 --> 03:19:51,760
Okay, who wants fried eggshells?

2481
03:20:21,399 --> 03:20:25,770
All right, let's get that ready.

2482
03:20:25,770 --> 03:20:26,610
Oh, right, okay.

2483
03:20:26,610 --> 03:20:27,829
This is gonna, this might be loud.

2484
03:20:27,829 --> 03:20:29,770
I would turn your volume down.

2485
03:20:29,770 --> 03:20:31,030
This could be awful.

2486
03:20:54,549 --> 03:20:57,309
I hate this, I hate this.

2487
03:20:57,309 --> 03:21:01,090
I'm not even in, I hate that.

2488
03:21:01,090 --> 03:21:03,110
Nothing about that is fucking fun.

2489
03:21:03,110 --> 03:21:05,370
Well, that was awful.

2490
03:21:05,370 --> 03:21:08,469
Oh, I just see, I just hate that.

2491
03:21:08,469 --> 03:21:30,299
I didn't like that.

2492
03:21:30,299 --> 03:21:34,989
I feel like I'm like sanitizing my house.

2493
03:21:34,989 --> 03:21:35,829
No, you don't understand.

2494
03:21:35,829 --> 03:21:47,549
I got, sweeping motions, Jeremy, sweeping motions.

2495
03:21:47,549 --> 03:21:49,530
Put your iPad in the microwave.

2496
03:21:56,770 --> 03:21:59,569
Open, why is this sealed shut?

2497
03:22:17,159 --> 03:22:18,760
I don't like this at all.

2498
03:22:18,760 --> 03:22:20,860
I hate this shit.

2499
03:22:20,860 --> 03:22:33,299
I hate this kind of shit, I really do.

2500
03:22:33,299 --> 03:22:40,520
I'm just opening up those snake cans in front of my face.

2501
03:22:40,520 --> 03:22:44,659
How's this doing?

2502
03:22:44,659 --> 03:22:46,780
This is just magma.

2503
03:22:46,780 --> 03:23:16,479
Is it on fire?

2504
03:23:16,479 --> 03:23:23,469
All right, I'm done.

2505
03:23:32,760 --> 03:23:33,600
Wait, what is that?

2506
03:23:33,600 --> 03:24:06,270
What is this?

2507
03:24:06,270 --> 03:24:07,989
This doesn't do anything.

2508
03:24:07,989 --> 03:24:09,069
All right, next game.

2509
03:24:09,069 --> 03:24:09,889
I'm gonna take a break.

2510
03:24:09,889 --> 03:24:10,729
I'm gonna get some water.

2511
03:24:10,729 --> 03:24:12,959
I'll be right back.

2512
03:24:12,959 --> 03:24:13,799
I have no idea.

2513
03:24:13,799 --> 03:24:16,479
My face is probably looks horrible right now.

2514
03:24:16,479 --> 03:24:18,629
I'm gonna take a quick break.

2515
03:24:18,629 --> 03:28:28,280
I'll be right back.

2516
03:28:28,280 --> 03:28:30,639
So now we're gonna play Blair Witch VR.

2517
03:28:30,639 --> 03:28:36,430
Said I was gonna play this a few weeks ago.

2518
03:28:36,430 --> 03:28:38,790
This is probably the last thing we're gonna do.

2519
03:28:38,790 --> 03:28:40,909
So however long I'm gonna do this for.

2520
03:28:42,799 --> 03:28:43,639
Somebody said, be careful.

2521
03:28:43,639 --> 03:28:48,940
This game is really slow going, but whatever, we'll see.

2522
03:28:48,940 --> 03:28:50,540
I do need to untangle my VR.

2523
03:28:53,690 --> 03:29:34,200
Very tangled.

2524
03:29:34,200 --> 03:29:36,559
All right, we're officially untangled.

2525
03:29:36,559 --> 03:29:38,079
I wanna mention this one more time too

2526
03:29:38,079 --> 03:29:39,920
because a lot of people are here now.

2527
03:29:41,700 --> 03:29:44,079
So if you watched the replacement stream,

2528
03:29:46,120 --> 03:29:49,280
the upload on the archive channel

2529
03:29:49,280 --> 03:29:54,879
has fixed like 90% of all the audio problems.

2530
03:29:54,879 --> 03:29:58,629
So I would say definitely, definitely check it out.

2531
03:29:58,629 --> 03:30:00,870
Any of those like weird laggy glitchy moments

2532
03:30:00,870 --> 03:30:05,479
have been fixed for the most part.

2533
03:30:05,520 --> 03:30:08,129
So I would say, check it out.

2534
03:30:08,129 --> 03:30:09,889
It was the studio recording, thank God.

2535
03:30:09,889 --> 03:30:14,989
All the lag issues we had are pretty much solved.

2536
03:30:14,989 --> 03:30:16,110
Let me untangle this for a second.

2537
03:30:16,110 --> 03:30:17,350
Give me one more minute.

2538
03:30:17,350 --> 03:31:00,909
Okay, you promised us Among Us.

2539
03:31:00,909 --> 03:31:04,350
Among Us VR is not out.

2540
03:31:04,350 --> 03:31:06,709
You guys just gaslit me into saying

2541
03:31:06,709 --> 03:31:11,979
I was gonna play it next time.

2542
03:31:11,979 --> 03:31:14,799
But yeah, I'm really, really, really happy

2543
03:31:14,799 --> 03:31:19,219
that at least the studio recording came out perfectly fine.

2544
03:31:20,809 --> 03:31:22,129
This is still a few little problems,

2545
03:31:22,129 --> 03:31:26,040
but if you wanna watch it again,

2546
03:31:26,040 --> 03:31:29,090
those issues should be kind of resolved.

2547
03:31:29,090 --> 03:31:32,520
All right, let's go.

2548
03:31:32,520 --> 03:31:34,680
Air witch VR, I'm so winded.

2549
03:31:34,680 --> 03:31:37,680
I'm gonna play VR.

2550
03:31:37,680 --> 03:31:41,379
There's a bunch of bricks on me.

2551
03:31:41,379 --> 03:31:49,879
Headset, talking about microwaves being problematic,

2552
03:31:49,879 --> 03:31:51,780
but bacon is a carcinogen.

2553
03:31:51,780 --> 03:31:59,780
It's a mush of all the worst parts of the pig.

2554
03:31:59,780 --> 03:32:09,479
I'm not saying it's one's worse than the other, what?

2555
03:32:09,479 --> 03:32:13,739
Plus bacon, look, all cooked meat is a carcinogen, right?

2556
03:32:13,739 --> 03:32:16,280
Especially if you grill it.

2557
03:32:16,280 --> 03:32:21,840
That delicious black char stuff, that's bad for you.

2558
03:32:21,959 --> 03:32:23,520
I mean, am I gonna stop eating that?

2559
03:32:23,520 --> 03:32:26,430
No.

2560
03:32:26,430 --> 03:32:28,809
Have I reduced the amount of meat that I probably consume?

2561
03:32:28,809 --> 03:32:31,319
Probably.

2562
03:32:31,319 --> 03:32:35,270
But I mean, come on.

2563
03:32:35,270 --> 03:32:40,030
I'm not gonna stop eating char broiled bacon bits.

2564
03:32:40,030 --> 03:32:46,489
All right, here we go.

2565
03:32:46,489 --> 03:32:48,030
Hey, Jeremy, is lettuce a liquid?

2566
03:32:48,030 --> 03:32:52,629
No.

2567
03:32:52,629 --> 03:33:00,459
All right, I'm coming back.

2568
03:33:00,459 --> 03:33:01,479
Where's my mouse?

2569
03:33:04,139 --> 03:33:06,739
Hello?

2570
03:33:06,739 --> 03:33:09,579
I don't know if this, where's the audio?

2571
03:33:09,579 --> 03:33:14,659
Is there any audio?

2572
03:33:21,479 --> 03:33:22,319
Weird.

2573
03:33:22,319 --> 03:33:23,159
Oh my God, what?

2574
03:33:23,159 --> 03:33:27,100
That scared the shit out of me.

2575
03:33:27,100 --> 03:33:34,569
There's just an animal over here.

2576
03:33:34,569 --> 03:33:36,309
I just saw movement and it was, okay,

2577
03:33:36,309 --> 03:33:41,409
movement type headset, standing mode, free movement.

2578
03:33:41,409 --> 03:33:43,149
All right, I feel like

2579
03:33:43,149 --> 03:33:45,989
you'll be hearing some kind of sounds here.

2580
03:33:45,989 --> 03:33:48,729
Hold on.

2581
03:33:48,729 --> 03:33:52,780
Why do we not hear audio?

2582
03:33:52,780 --> 03:33:54,340
Hey, there's audio.

2583
03:33:54,340 --> 03:33:55,979
Hopefully it's not too, too loud.

2584
03:34:01,209 --> 03:34:03,760
Hello?

2585
03:34:03,760 --> 03:34:04,579
What happened?

2586
03:34:04,579 --> 03:34:09,219
I just had it, what the fuck happened to it?

2587
03:34:09,219 --> 03:34:15,500
Fucking VR.

2588
03:34:15,500 --> 03:34:16,579
What happened to the audio?

2589
03:34:16,579 --> 03:34:26,250
I just had it.

2590
03:34:26,250 --> 03:34:27,250
Where's the audio?

2591
03:34:27,250 --> 03:34:32,629
It was just here.

2592
03:34:32,629 --> 03:34:37,920
Fucking audio.

2593
03:34:37,920 --> 03:34:41,510
Like the game window, yeah, I did.

2594
03:34:41,510 --> 03:34:53,129
I can't, it was, I just had it.

2595
03:34:53,129 --> 03:34:59,420
Yeah, this ass is a carcinogen.

2596
03:34:59,420 --> 03:35:07,000
Like one out of every three VR games works.

2597
03:35:07,000 --> 03:35:16,979
Okay, let me try reloading it again.

2598
03:35:16,979 --> 03:35:19,700
I feel like there's better odds at playing roulette

2599
03:35:20,700 --> 03:35:22,020
than actually getting a VR game

2600
03:35:22,020 --> 03:35:29,280
to work the way you want it to.

2601
03:35:29,280 --> 03:35:32,739
Yeah, the audio's there.

2602
03:35:32,739 --> 03:35:35,819
Yeah, I got Blair Witch VR down here in my taskbar.

2603
03:35:35,819 --> 03:35:37,260
I clicked it.

2604
03:35:37,260 --> 03:35:39,979
It has clicked right now.

2605
03:35:39,979 --> 03:35:50,799
It has opened up a second.

2606
03:35:50,799 --> 03:35:59,510
Why is there even a second window here?

2607
03:35:59,510 --> 03:36:03,000
Yeah, it doesn't wanna pull the audio anymore.

2608
03:36:03,000 --> 03:36:04,239
Welcome to fucking hell.

2609
03:36:06,040 --> 03:36:07,840
I'm gonna try, I'm gonna restart the game

2610
03:36:07,840 --> 03:36:12,780
and see if that does anything.

2611
03:36:12,780 --> 03:36:15,520
German, do you know how to work a computer?

2612
03:36:15,520 --> 03:36:19,879
Yeah, I want, I hate VR.

2613
03:36:19,879 --> 03:36:23,850
I'm literally never playing it again.

2614
03:36:24,489 --> 03:36:32,870
I fucking hate this thing.

2615
03:36:32,870 --> 03:36:34,270
Let me get back into it.

2616
03:36:34,270 --> 03:36:36,030
Let me try to reload the game again.

2617
03:36:42,870 --> 03:36:49,350
You can hear the audio now.

2618
03:36:49,350 --> 03:36:51,709
I'm just gonna give this headset away to one of you guys.

2619
03:36:51,709 --> 03:36:53,870
I'm gonna sign it and I'm gonna write,

2620
03:36:53,870 --> 03:36:55,989
don't fucking ever use this.

2621
03:36:55,989 --> 03:37:04,940
Don't play this.

2622
03:37:04,940 --> 03:37:10,479
Only for decoration only is what I'm gonna write on it.

2623
03:37:10,479 --> 03:37:13,440
Okay, so it should be in the window right now.

2624
03:37:15,239 --> 03:37:21,079
Oh my God, I can hear the audio.

2625
03:37:21,079 --> 03:37:25,909
No, don't.

2626
03:37:25,950 --> 03:37:28,909
Oh my fucking God, okay.

2627
03:37:28,909 --> 03:37:32,520
I need to full screen the window though.

2628
03:37:32,520 --> 03:37:47,819
What the, God damn it.

2629
03:37:47,819 --> 03:37:50,139
That, I did the exact same shit last time,

2630
03:37:50,139 --> 03:37:54,049
didn't do anything.

2631
03:37:54,049 --> 03:37:56,090
Like the planets have to be in the right spot.

2632
03:37:56,090 --> 03:38:07,780
The earth has to be the right rotation for VR to work.

2633
03:38:07,780 --> 03:38:08,620
All right, what do I do?

2634
03:38:08,620 --> 03:38:15,399
Can I pet the dog?

2635
03:38:15,399 --> 03:38:16,479
Who's a good dog?

2636
03:38:16,479 --> 03:38:19,059
Yes, you're a good dog.

2637
03:38:19,059 --> 03:38:23,559
Who's a good dog?

2638
03:38:23,559 --> 03:38:26,180
What is it?

2639
03:38:26,180 --> 03:38:28,639
Okay, standing mode, free movement, comfort, sir,

2640
03:38:28,639 --> 03:38:30,639
that's fine.

2641
03:38:30,639 --> 03:38:33,399
Video settings, auto-detect.

2642
03:38:33,399 --> 03:38:55,569
Okay, new game.

2643
03:38:55,569 --> 03:39:10,420
A blooper team production.

2644
03:39:10,420 --> 03:39:12,329
Where are we going?

2645
03:39:12,329 --> 03:39:13,250
Welcome to

2646
03:39:15,219 --> 03:39:16,379
Burkittsville.

2647
03:39:34,670 --> 03:39:35,750
Did I skip?

2648
03:39:35,750 --> 03:39:36,590
I'm sorry.

2649
03:39:36,590 --> 03:39:38,909
This marks the latest in a series of disappearances

2650
03:39:38,909 --> 03:39:46,159
dating back to Nukketsville.

2651
03:39:46,159 --> 03:39:47,000
What's with the cops?

2652
03:39:47,000 --> 03:39:55,870
What's going on?

2653
03:39:55,870 --> 03:39:56,950
Missing.

2654
03:39:56,950 --> 03:39:57,950
Peter Shannon.

2655
03:39:59,430 --> 03:40:02,149
Peter Shannon, my son, I'm gonna assume maybe.

2656
03:40:02,149 --> 03:40:05,020
I think.

2657
03:40:05,020 --> 03:40:06,219
Wait, why did this?

2658
03:40:06,219 --> 03:40:10,030
Oh my God, don't do that.

2659
03:40:10,030 --> 03:40:21,500
It sounds like it's jump-cutting.

2660
03:40:21,500 --> 03:40:26,590
Peter.

2661
03:40:26,590 --> 03:40:29,670
Okay, imagine getting something in your eye in VR

2662
03:40:29,670 --> 03:40:31,590
and it ain't coming out.

2663
03:40:31,590 --> 03:40:32,809
Okay, grab your phone.

2664
03:40:42,719 --> 03:40:47,069
Free movement, I don't know how to use the phone.

2665
03:40:47,069 --> 03:40:51,139
Jess, hey, yeah, it's good to hear from you.

2666
03:40:51,139 --> 03:41:00,149
Good to hear from you.

2667
03:41:00,149 --> 03:41:02,149
Did you hear about the missing kid?

2668
03:41:02,149 --> 03:41:10,040
Missing kid.

2669
03:41:10,040 --> 03:41:20,559
Why wouldn't it be?

2670
03:41:20,559 --> 03:41:21,399
How do you hang up?

2671
03:41:21,399 --> 03:41:23,559
Wait, wait, wait, no, I'm glad I did.

2672
03:41:23,559 --> 03:41:26,159
Listen, I'm almost there.

2673
03:41:26,159 --> 03:41:27,719
I'll call you later, okay?

2674
03:41:30,389 --> 03:41:33,389
So I'm out here at a search party to look for a kid.

2675
03:41:33,389 --> 03:41:34,350
Let's go, bullet.

2676
03:41:36,260 --> 03:41:37,260
All right, let's go.

2677
03:41:42,340 --> 03:41:43,180
What do we got?

2678
03:41:43,180 --> 03:41:44,750
It started without us, huh?

2679
03:41:44,750 --> 03:41:47,700
Let's take a look, what do we got?

2680
03:41:47,700 --> 03:41:49,379
Okay, bullet, let's see.

2681
03:41:51,620 --> 03:41:53,100
Oh, we got a note here.

2682
03:41:55,180 --> 03:41:56,100
We got a note.

2683
03:41:56,100 --> 03:41:57,860
He's been through enough already.

2684
03:42:01,260 --> 03:42:02,500
Sorry, Anthony.

2685
03:42:02,500 --> 03:42:03,940
First come, first served.

2686
03:42:03,940 --> 03:42:04,780
What is this?

2687
03:42:04,780 --> 03:42:06,719
I'll call landing once I'm in the forest.

2688
03:42:06,719 --> 03:42:12,020
Why would I have this for?

2689
03:42:12,020 --> 03:42:16,270
All right, what do you got?

2690
03:42:16,270 --> 03:42:17,110
Keep going, all right.

2691
03:42:17,110 --> 03:42:25,500
I gotta find this kid.

2692
03:42:25,500 --> 03:42:26,899
Some items found during the game

2693
03:42:26,899 --> 03:42:27,860
can be stored in your backpack.

2694
03:42:27,860 --> 03:42:29,809
Okay, cool.

2695
03:42:29,809 --> 03:42:32,500
Oh, that's my backpack.

2696
03:42:32,500 --> 03:42:33,420
What is this?

2697
03:42:33,420 --> 03:42:36,270
My ID?

2698
03:42:36,270 --> 03:42:37,190
What the hell is that?

2699
03:42:37,190 --> 03:42:41,139
Wait, did I just take a sofa?

2700
03:42:41,139 --> 03:42:43,219
What is this, a tent?

2701
03:42:43,219 --> 03:42:45,260
Hey, drop it, drop it, drop that.

2702
03:42:45,260 --> 03:42:46,459
Don't touch that, disgusting.

2703
03:42:46,459 --> 03:42:47,299
Disgusting.

2704
03:42:52,920 --> 03:42:55,889
What was the point of that?

2705
03:42:55,889 --> 03:42:58,219
What was the point?

2706
03:42:58,219 --> 03:43:00,889
Oh, Mike.

2707
03:43:00,889 --> 03:43:04,260
That's some strength.

2708
03:43:06,290 --> 03:43:10,639
What was the point of that?

2709
03:43:10,639 --> 03:43:13,120
Let me see, what is this?

2710
03:43:13,120 --> 03:43:15,000
Looking for the missing kid.

2711
03:43:15,000 --> 03:43:15,840
Nine years old.

2712
03:43:15,840 --> 03:43:20,239
He's four foot four, weighs 68 pounds, okay.

2713
03:43:20,239 --> 03:43:31,020
He was in a green t-shirt.

2714
03:43:31,020 --> 03:43:32,549
Donut, cool.

2715
03:43:32,549 --> 03:43:33,469
All right, none of this shit matters.

2716
03:43:33,469 --> 03:43:34,309
It's just fluff.

2717
03:43:34,309 --> 03:43:38,459
Let's go.

2718
03:43:38,459 --> 03:43:39,299
What's that?

2719
03:43:39,299 --> 03:43:41,170
Knife?

2720
03:43:41,170 --> 03:43:42,010
What is this?

2721
03:43:42,010 --> 03:43:44,819
What is this?

2722
03:43:44,819 --> 03:43:50,500
You wanna play?

2723
03:43:50,500 --> 03:43:57,110
Try grabbing the whistle.

2724
03:43:57,110 --> 03:43:58,899
Okay, where's the whistle?

2725
03:44:03,100 --> 03:44:06,930
Seek.

2726
03:44:06,930 --> 03:44:08,129
Pull it.

2727
03:44:08,370 --> 03:44:09,209
What does this do?

2728
03:44:09,209 --> 03:44:10,829
Snack?

2729
03:44:10,829 --> 03:44:12,229
Stay close to me.

2730
03:44:12,229 --> 03:44:17,000
You want a snack?

2731
03:44:17,000 --> 03:44:18,139
Come here, boy.

2732
03:44:18,139 --> 03:44:21,030
Snack.

2733
03:44:21,030 --> 03:44:24,500
Do I have food for him?

2734
03:44:24,500 --> 03:44:26,840
Bullet, seek.

2735
03:44:26,840 --> 03:44:27,680
What?

2736
03:44:27,680 --> 03:44:29,979
Heal.

2737
03:44:29,979 --> 03:44:31,989
Stay close.

2738
03:44:31,989 --> 03:44:33,709
What the fuck are you talking?

2739
03:44:33,709 --> 03:44:35,950
Seek.

2740
03:44:35,950 --> 03:44:41,129
Bullet, look around, boy.

2741
03:44:41,129 --> 03:44:44,629
That's a really awful way to have that be mapped.

2742
03:44:44,629 --> 03:44:47,389
All right, let's go.

2743
03:44:47,389 --> 03:44:48,430
You have to blow it?

2744
03:44:57,819 --> 03:44:59,979
What are you talking about?

2745
03:44:59,979 --> 03:45:08,379
Stay close.

2746
03:45:08,379 --> 03:45:17,340
You were wrong.

2747
03:45:17,379 --> 03:45:18,579
Let's go find this kid.

2748
03:45:35,620 --> 03:45:51,399
Stuff's named gamer posture.

2749
03:45:51,399 --> 03:45:56,440
Scary Blair witch.

2750
03:45:56,440 --> 03:45:57,479
Be careful.

2751
03:45:57,479 --> 03:45:59,799
She's gonna come get you.

2752
03:45:59,799 --> 03:46:02,690
In the woods.

2753
03:46:02,690 --> 03:46:09,659
Chapter one, into the woods.

2754
03:46:09,659 --> 03:46:13,940
Machine gun fire?

2755
03:46:13,940 --> 03:46:15,420
The dog better not die.

2756
03:46:15,420 --> 03:46:17,219
I know, right?

2757
03:46:17,219 --> 03:46:21,180
I don't want that to happen either.

2758
03:46:21,180 --> 03:46:23,600
Okay.

2759
03:46:23,600 --> 03:46:24,700
Bullet, seek.

2760
03:46:24,700 --> 03:46:25,979
I don't know why he keeps doing this.

2761
03:46:25,979 --> 03:46:36,909
Bullet.

2762
03:46:36,909 --> 03:46:40,139
Stay close.

2763
03:46:40,139 --> 03:46:42,020
Do I have to press A or something?

2764
03:46:42,020 --> 03:46:48,030
Bullet.

2765
03:46:48,030 --> 03:46:48,989
Is it stay close?

2766
03:46:51,030 --> 03:46:52,590
It's called landing.

2767
03:46:52,590 --> 03:46:53,909
During the game, you can try to communicate

2768
03:46:53,909 --> 03:46:56,219
using the walkie talkie, okay?

2769
03:46:56,219 --> 03:47:00,690
Walkie talkie.

2770
03:47:00,690 --> 03:47:01,530
Okay.

2771
03:47:01,530 --> 03:47:02,409
Where's the walkie talkie?

2772
03:47:02,409 --> 03:47:03,370
Up here?

2773
03:47:03,370 --> 03:47:04,290
Bullet.

2774
03:47:04,290 --> 03:47:05,780
That's my whistle.

2775
03:47:05,780 --> 03:47:06,620
Come here, boy.

2776
03:47:06,620 --> 03:47:08,159
What the fuck?

2777
03:47:08,159 --> 03:47:10,120
Where is it?

2778
03:47:10,120 --> 03:47:17,979
Bullet.

2779
03:47:17,979 --> 03:47:19,120
Ellis to base.

2780
03:47:19,120 --> 03:47:23,969
Do you copy?

2781
03:47:23,969 --> 03:47:35,319
Joining the search party.

2782
03:47:35,319 --> 03:47:36,520
Sir. Is there a sprint?

2783
03:47:36,520 --> 03:47:37,790
I'm here to help.

2784
03:47:37,790 --> 03:47:39,510
That's all there is to it.

2785
03:47:39,510 --> 03:47:40,879
Bullet's with me.

2786
03:47:40,879 --> 03:47:42,079
If he catches the scent,

2787
03:47:42,079 --> 03:47:47,340
he'll lead us straight to the kid.

2788
03:47:47,340 --> 03:47:53,229
Heard he needs some graphics.

2789
03:47:53,229 --> 03:47:54,500
Sir.

2790
03:47:54,500 --> 03:47:55,340
Sticky keys.

2791
03:47:56,170 --> 03:48:04,059
Not this time.

2792
03:48:04,059 --> 03:48:05,200
Roger that.

2793
03:48:05,200 --> 03:48:08,649
Over and out.

2794
03:48:08,649 --> 03:48:09,489
Okay.

2795
03:48:09,489 --> 03:48:10,329
Time to get to work.

2796
03:48:10,329 --> 03:48:17,090
Oh, he's got something.

2797
03:48:17,090 --> 03:48:20,450
What'd you find, Bullet?

2798
03:48:20,450 --> 03:48:23,819
Did you find a trace of anything?

2799
03:48:23,819 --> 03:48:24,659
What do you got?

2800
03:48:24,659 --> 03:48:25,500
What's in here?

2801
03:48:25,500 --> 03:48:26,340
Looking for Peter.

2802
03:48:26,340 --> 03:48:27,620
Not the search party, buddy.

2803
03:48:27,620 --> 03:48:29,659
Oh, look.

2804
03:48:29,659 --> 03:48:35,700
Another missing persons thing.

2805
03:48:35,700 --> 03:48:37,159
Okay.

2806
03:48:37,159 --> 03:48:39,579
So, a night in the woods.

2807
03:48:39,579 --> 03:48:41,590
Like old times, huh?

2808
03:48:52,079 --> 03:48:52,920
I'm fine.

2809
03:48:52,920 --> 03:48:53,760
I'm fine.

2810
03:48:53,760 --> 03:48:59,770
This will be different.

2811
03:48:59,770 --> 03:49:05,079
Yes, this is the Blair Witch.

2812
03:49:05,079 --> 03:49:06,479
Ooh.

2813
03:49:06,479 --> 03:49:12,690
It's not your goddamn trash can.

2814
03:49:12,690 --> 03:49:13,530
What did we find?

2815
03:49:13,530 --> 03:49:15,250
What do you got?

2816
03:49:15,250 --> 03:49:18,270
Where are you?

2817
03:49:18,270 --> 03:49:19,110
Oh.

2818
03:49:19,110 --> 03:49:19,950
What do you got?

2819
03:49:19,950 --> 03:49:22,440
Something?

2820
03:49:22,440 --> 03:49:23,280
Oh my God.

2821
03:49:23,280 --> 03:49:24,120
It's something.

2822
03:49:24,120 --> 03:49:37,219
I think there's a body in here.

2823
03:49:37,219 --> 03:49:40,239
What is it?

2824
03:49:40,239 --> 03:49:41,079
What'd you find?

2825
03:49:41,079 --> 03:49:44,370
Oh, I thought it was...

2826
03:49:44,370 --> 03:49:45,209
Am I gonna see it?

2827
03:49:45,209 --> 03:49:46,049
Let me see it.

2828
03:49:46,049 --> 03:49:46,889
Baltimore crows.

2829
03:49:46,889 --> 03:49:47,889
The Boston Red Sox.

2830
03:49:47,889 --> 03:49:49,549
That's Peter's cap.

2831
03:49:49,549 --> 03:49:50,629
Good boy.

2832
03:49:50,629 --> 03:49:51,469
Okay, I got it.

2833
03:49:51,469 --> 03:49:52,290
Sorry.

2834
03:49:52,290 --> 03:49:53,129
Can you follow the scent?

2835
03:49:53,129 --> 03:49:53,969
All right.

2836
03:49:53,969 --> 03:49:56,180
Just follow the scent.

2837
03:49:56,180 --> 03:49:58,350
Go with, buddy.

2838
03:49:58,350 --> 03:50:00,329
Come here.

2839
03:50:00,329 --> 03:50:01,149
What is the game?

2840
03:50:01,149 --> 03:50:01,989
What's happening with the game?

2841
03:50:01,989 --> 03:50:03,709
Why is the game so dark?

2842
03:50:03,709 --> 03:50:06,690
Can you smell?

2843
03:50:09,260 --> 03:50:10,540
He's got it.

2844
03:50:10,540 --> 03:50:11,379
Okay, hold on.

2845
03:50:11,379 --> 03:50:15,639
I need...

2846
03:50:15,639 --> 03:50:20,559
Wait, where'd he go?

2847
03:50:20,559 --> 03:50:28,940
Bullet.

2848
03:50:28,940 --> 03:50:29,760
All right.

2849
03:50:29,760 --> 03:50:34,040
Where is it?

2850
03:50:34,040 --> 03:50:34,879
Is there a sprint?

2851
03:50:34,879 --> 03:50:38,049
There has to be.

2852
03:50:38,049 --> 03:50:42,840
Where'd he go?

2853
03:50:42,840 --> 03:50:43,739
Bullet, wait up.

2854
03:50:43,739 --> 03:50:48,469
Don't go through this tall brush.

2855
03:50:48,469 --> 03:50:58,590
What happened?

2856
03:50:58,590 --> 03:50:59,690
Excuse me?

2857
03:51:07,590 --> 03:51:08,430
What happened?

2858
03:51:08,430 --> 03:51:10,000
Who the hell is he?

2859
03:51:10,000 --> 03:51:10,979
I don't...

2860
03:51:10,979 --> 03:51:14,260
What just happened to me?

2861
03:51:14,260 --> 03:51:18,110
Not now.

2862
03:51:18,110 --> 03:51:19,110
I can't call him.

2863
03:51:19,110 --> 03:51:19,950
Get a grip, Alice.

2864
03:51:19,950 --> 03:51:24,959
I'm not giving up now.

2865
03:51:24,959 --> 03:51:28,139
Has somebody shot an arrow at me?

2866
03:51:28,139 --> 03:51:40,010
An arrow just went by my head.

2867
03:51:40,049 --> 03:51:42,629
What happened?

2868
03:51:42,629 --> 03:51:44,540
What's going on?

2869
03:51:44,540 --> 03:51:48,579
The sun's so bright.

2870
03:51:48,579 --> 03:51:57,739
What's going on?

2871
03:51:57,739 --> 03:51:59,209
What?

2872
03:52:06,709 --> 03:52:07,549
That was weird.

2873
03:52:09,940 --> 03:52:12,579
Prolonged loneliness can affect your mental state.

2874
03:52:14,680 --> 03:52:18,440
Prolonged loneliness?

2875
03:52:18,440 --> 03:52:19,760
Um, okay.

2876
03:52:19,760 --> 03:52:21,000
So we gotta not...

2877
03:52:21,000 --> 03:52:21,840
We...

2878
03:52:21,840 --> 03:52:23,139
Well, don't run away.

2879
03:52:23,139 --> 03:52:23,979
Hold on.

2880
03:52:23,979 --> 03:52:25,360
Come back here.

2881
03:52:29,829 --> 03:52:35,299
All right, stay close.

2882
03:52:35,299 --> 03:52:37,120
Ooh, that's an itchy spot.

2883
03:52:38,180 --> 03:52:39,870
Okay, now what?

2884
03:52:39,870 --> 03:52:51,110
Where are we going now?

2885
03:52:51,110 --> 03:52:52,229
Okay.

2886
03:52:52,229 --> 03:52:58,149
I guess we're gonna go this way.

2887
03:52:58,149 --> 03:53:00,979
Where is it?

2888
03:53:00,979 --> 03:53:04,510
No, I want to answer the phone, not button the person.

2889
03:53:04,510 --> 03:53:11,020
Can I call that person back?

2890
03:53:11,020 --> 03:53:11,860
Is that...

2891
03:53:11,860 --> 03:53:12,700
What is...

2892
03:53:12,700 --> 03:53:21,280
Is it a picture?

2893
03:53:21,280 --> 03:53:22,420
Oh, come on, really?

2894
03:53:28,299 --> 03:53:33,239
Good night, Jerma, and chat.

2895
03:53:33,239 --> 03:53:35,860
Stay over here with me.

2896
03:53:35,860 --> 03:53:36,840
Well, good night.

2897
03:53:36,840 --> 03:53:37,680
Thanks for watching.

2898
03:53:37,680 --> 03:53:39,440
Thanks for hanging out.

2899
03:53:39,479 --> 03:53:42,329
Oh, a few things to talk about real quick.

2900
03:53:42,329 --> 03:53:45,190
I'm gonna be streaming on Saturday and Sunday this week.

2901
03:53:45,190 --> 03:53:48,190
Sunday, Ster and I are gonna play Dying Light 2.

2902
03:53:48,190 --> 03:53:49,290
Gonna go back to normal,

2903
03:53:49,290 --> 03:53:52,299
back to the regularly scheduled programming.

2904
03:53:52,299 --> 03:53:53,500
I'm not sure what we're gonna do Saturday,

2905
03:53:53,500 --> 03:53:54,940
but we'll figure that out.

2906
03:53:59,700 --> 03:54:01,760
That's the plan for this week.

2907
03:54:01,760 --> 03:54:03,100
So I'll see you guys on Saturday.

2908
03:54:03,100 --> 03:54:04,000
End of the stream, voice?

2909
03:54:04,000 --> 03:54:05,000
No, not quite.

2910
03:54:05,000 --> 03:54:10,459
Not quite, not until I get scared at least once.

2911
03:54:10,459 --> 03:54:17,940
This dog looks like Scooby-Doo.

2912
03:54:17,940 --> 03:54:21,940
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

2913
03:54:22,780 --> 03:54:25,739
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2914
03:54:25,739 --> 03:54:33,139
Every video game, I win.

2915
03:54:33,139 --> 03:54:37,600
Why am I yelling?

2916
03:54:37,600 --> 03:54:38,479
Every time I play VR,

2917
03:54:38,479 --> 03:54:52,290
I just talk so much louder than normal.

2918
03:54:52,290 --> 03:54:53,940
Bullet, stay close.

2919
03:54:53,940 --> 03:54:58,250
Bullet, stay close to me.

2920
03:54:58,250 --> 03:54:59,770
There's a tent over there, Bullet.

2921
03:54:59,770 --> 03:55:06,819
There's a tent.

2922
03:55:06,819 --> 03:55:07,639
Camp site?

2923
03:55:07,639 --> 03:55:09,420
It is.

2924
03:55:09,420 --> 03:55:12,620
Oh, no.

2925
03:55:12,620 --> 03:55:25,139
Oh, no.

2926
03:55:25,139 --> 03:55:26,940
Alice, maybe you should...

2927
03:55:26,940 --> 03:55:28,500
No, I'm fine.

2928
03:55:28,500 --> 03:55:29,540
I'll deal with it.

2929
03:55:29,540 --> 03:55:32,020
I just need a little more time.

2930
03:55:32,020 --> 03:55:33,540
Why does she have a blurred out face?

2931
03:55:33,579 --> 03:55:36,780
What you need is help.

2932
03:55:36,780 --> 03:55:40,219
I could've managed.

2933
03:55:40,219 --> 03:55:43,000
Alice, I can't do this anymore.

2934
03:55:43,000 --> 03:55:43,840
What?

2935
03:55:43,840 --> 03:55:44,920
What is it this time?

2936
03:55:44,920 --> 03:55:46,360
What, I wasn't smiling enough?

2937
03:55:46,360 --> 03:55:48,680
Didn't say I love you for five fucking minutes?

2938
03:55:48,680 --> 03:55:50,040
Jesus Christ, Alice.

2939
03:55:50,040 --> 03:55:51,360
Do you even hear yourself?

2940
03:55:51,360 --> 03:55:53,280
Yeah, I can hear myself just fine.

2941
03:55:53,280 --> 03:55:54,959
And I can see the way you look at me.

2942
03:55:54,959 --> 03:55:56,360
Like I'm a fucking loser.

2943
03:55:56,360 --> 03:55:59,729
You're a sick little puppy for you to look after.

2944
03:55:59,729 --> 03:56:02,809
Don't lie, Alice.

2945
03:56:02,809 --> 03:56:04,649
Get over yourself, Alice.

2946
03:56:04,649 --> 03:56:05,969
Be a man for once.

2947
03:56:05,969 --> 03:56:06,809
This is like Silent Hill.

2948
03:56:06,809 --> 03:56:07,930
There it is.

2949
03:56:07,930 --> 03:56:09,209
There it is.

2950
03:56:10,170 --> 03:56:14,540
I'm getting all this from looking at the camcorder?

2951
03:56:14,540 --> 03:56:20,379
I hope you can figure it out, Alice.

2952
03:56:20,379 --> 03:56:22,860
I'm trying to help you.

2953
03:56:22,860 --> 03:56:25,420
I just can't be around you anymore.

2954
03:56:25,420 --> 03:56:26,940
Go ahead, get out.

2955
03:56:26,940 --> 03:56:33,069
Leave me the fuck alone.

2956
03:56:33,069 --> 03:56:40,290
Jesus.

2957
03:56:40,290 --> 03:56:46,739
Incoming call.

2958
03:56:46,739 --> 03:56:50,610
What did I do?

2959
03:56:50,610 --> 03:56:51,450
What am I doing?

2960
03:56:51,450 --> 03:57:06,069
Master, you wanted to see me, sir?

2961
03:57:06,069 --> 03:57:07,190
Better yet.

2962
03:57:07,190 --> 03:57:08,909
I wanna introduce you to someone.

2963
03:57:08,909 --> 03:57:11,309
Bullet, meet your new partner.

2964
03:57:11,309 --> 03:57:13,309
He's been through a lot, just like you.

2965
03:57:13,309 --> 03:57:14,309
What?

2966
03:57:14,350 --> 03:57:15,829
Sir, I can't.

2967
03:57:15,829 --> 03:57:16,950
Well, you got something else going on right now.

2968
03:57:16,950 --> 03:57:18,149
Is he a puppy?

2969
03:57:18,149 --> 03:57:20,629
Just take the damn dog, Alice.

2970
03:57:20,629 --> 03:57:21,750
Yes, sir.

2971
03:57:32,219 --> 03:57:35,069
It's Otto.

2972
03:57:35,069 --> 03:57:37,860
We're already at chapter three?

2973
03:57:37,860 --> 03:57:42,840
I feel like this is going way too, wait, chapter three.

2974
03:57:42,840 --> 03:57:50,500
Are there 45 chapters in this game?

2975
03:57:50,500 --> 03:57:51,819
I'm speed running.

2976
03:57:58,159 --> 03:58:03,120
Well, we're inside the tent.

2977
03:58:03,120 --> 03:58:04,920
Don't, boy, Jesus.

2978
03:58:06,409 --> 03:58:07,530
Oh, no, where is it?

2979
03:58:08,969 --> 03:58:10,540
Bullet.

2980
03:58:10,540 --> 03:58:14,280
Bullet, where did it go?

2981
03:58:14,879 --> 03:58:16,790
Where is it?

2982
03:58:17,829 --> 03:58:18,790
Bullet, where'd that just go?

2983
03:58:18,790 --> 03:58:19,629
You just had it.

2984
03:58:20,829 --> 03:58:24,360
Bullet, where is it?

2985
03:58:24,360 --> 03:58:25,200
Shit.

2986
03:58:31,959 --> 03:58:37,370
Wait, I don't have to do this again?

2987
03:58:37,370 --> 03:58:39,729
Red tapes allow you to manipulate reality.

2988
03:58:49,340 --> 03:58:50,780
Wait, what's going on?

2989
03:58:53,819 --> 03:58:56,659
Okay, so there was a, something happened here.

2990
03:58:56,659 --> 03:59:04,899
I can rewind?

2991
03:59:04,899 --> 03:59:07,379
Okay, so what do I do now?

2992
03:59:07,379 --> 03:59:08,620
Okay, that's fun.

2993
03:59:08,620 --> 03:59:09,819
I need that flashlight.

2994
03:59:14,399 --> 03:59:16,709
Thank God, all right.

2995
03:59:16,709 --> 03:59:17,870
Thanks a lot, Bullet.

2996
03:59:17,870 --> 03:59:21,040
Appreciate it.

2997
03:59:21,040 --> 03:59:22,079
What is this?

2998
03:59:22,079 --> 03:59:22,920
Paintbrush?

2999
03:59:28,690 --> 03:59:32,709
Okay.

3000
03:59:32,709 --> 03:59:35,340
Ooh, hamburger helper.

3001
03:59:35,340 --> 03:59:37,219
Oh, that looks like a fucking gross omelet.

3002
03:59:37,219 --> 03:59:38,899
Some leftovers inside.

3003
03:59:38,899 --> 03:59:40,739
Maybe a few days old.

3004
03:59:40,739 --> 03:59:45,489
A few days old?

3005
03:59:45,489 --> 03:59:46,850
All right, let's go.

3006
03:59:46,850 --> 03:59:48,940
I think I have to go over here.

3007
03:59:48,940 --> 03:59:49,780
What does this say?

3008
03:59:49,780 --> 03:59:53,940
FM 2176, field manual.

3009
03:59:53,940 --> 03:59:56,100
Spinning a cushioning game.

3010
03:59:56,100 --> 03:59:59,149
First it's witches and curses, now what?

3011
04:00:00,780 --> 04:00:03,799
All right, you go first.

3012
04:00:03,799 --> 04:00:09,440
Did I get everything?

3013
04:00:09,440 --> 04:00:10,799
What's over there?

3014
04:00:10,799 --> 04:00:11,879
Ooh, a note, a note.

3015
04:00:11,879 --> 04:00:28,079
There's a note on the ground, a note on the ground.

3016
04:00:28,079 --> 04:00:35,500
What is it?

3017
04:00:35,500 --> 04:00:44,840
No, dog, these are leaves.

3018
04:00:44,840 --> 04:00:51,530
Can I start a fire?

3019
04:00:51,530 --> 04:00:53,770
Oh, a big juicy double cheeseburger

3020
04:00:53,770 --> 04:00:56,430
sounds like it's gonna be perfect.

3021
04:00:56,430 --> 04:01:02,299
Don't you agree?

3022
04:01:02,299 --> 04:01:10,270
I'm gonna, oh, I can't wait.

3023
04:01:10,270 --> 04:01:12,069
Oh, hey, is Lost Ark any good?

3024
04:01:12,069 --> 04:01:12,909
Did I play it?

3025
04:01:12,909 --> 04:01:13,750
I need some opinions.

3026
04:01:13,750 --> 04:01:22,020
I need some outside opinions.

3027
04:01:22,020 --> 04:01:23,139
No.

3028
04:01:23,139 --> 04:01:24,709
Fuck that.

3029
04:01:24,709 --> 04:01:26,739
No.

3030
04:01:26,780 --> 04:01:27,620
Why somebody knows?

3031
04:01:27,620 --> 04:01:31,819
I, okay, that game got announced.

3032
04:01:31,819 --> 04:01:34,180
I remember.

3033
04:01:34,180 --> 04:01:35,420
I remember sitting, I think, in a call

3034
04:01:35,420 --> 04:01:40,420
with like STIR and MLC Stealth in like 2012 or something.

3035
04:01:41,430 --> 04:01:43,430
And it was like, oh wow, this is gonna be so much fun.

3036
04:01:43,430 --> 04:01:46,979
It's like a Diablo-esque like MMO.

3037
04:01:46,979 --> 04:01:49,579
Then 10 years later, I guess it's like out now somehow.

3038
04:01:49,579 --> 04:01:53,170
It came out like four years ago in like Korea or something.

3039
04:01:53,170 --> 04:01:57,510
What's going on here?

3040
04:01:57,510 --> 04:01:59,610
What do we do about this?

3041
04:01:59,610 --> 04:02:02,809
I'm not gonna put my fucking hand in there.

3042
04:02:02,850 --> 04:02:05,700
Is that gonna do anything?

3043
04:02:05,700 --> 04:02:08,549
Just clasped around me.

3044
04:02:08,549 --> 04:02:11,219
What's wrong?

3045
04:02:11,219 --> 04:02:18,059
Why is the dog freaking out?

3046
04:02:18,059 --> 04:02:19,219
I don't know what's here.

3047
04:02:19,219 --> 04:02:27,469
What's wrong?

3048
04:02:27,469 --> 04:02:32,260
You guys, okay, so I've never seen

3049
04:02:32,260 --> 04:02:33,860
any of the Blair Witch movies.

3050
04:02:33,860 --> 04:02:35,870
None of them.

3051
04:02:35,870 --> 04:02:37,350
Does the Blair Witch ever come out on screen

3052
04:02:37,350 --> 04:02:42,940
and is like, is there like an actual Blair Witch

3053
04:02:42,940 --> 04:02:46,100
like old lady that is like walking around

3054
04:02:46,100 --> 04:02:47,540
and being like, I'm scared.

3055
04:02:47,540 --> 04:02:48,379
Does that happen?

3056
04:02:51,719 --> 04:02:59,059
What's that?

3057
04:02:59,059 --> 04:03:01,329
Okay.

3058
04:03:01,329 --> 04:03:02,489
Where's my flashlight?

3059
04:03:03,950 --> 04:03:04,790
Where's my flashlight?

3060
04:03:04,790 --> 04:03:06,270
Where's my flashlight?

3061
04:03:06,270 --> 04:03:08,059
Where's my flashlight?

3062
04:03:08,059 --> 04:03:13,170
What is this?

3063
04:03:13,170 --> 04:03:21,899
Can I record?

3064
04:03:21,899 --> 04:03:23,370
Hey!

3065
04:03:23,370 --> 04:03:24,209
Hey!

3066
04:03:24,209 --> 04:03:25,049
Hey!

3067
04:03:25,049 --> 04:03:28,750
I didn't mean to.

3068
04:03:28,750 --> 04:03:29,590
Okay.

3069
04:03:29,590 --> 04:03:30,790
Relax.

3070
04:03:30,790 --> 04:03:33,299
What even was that?

3071
04:03:33,299 --> 04:03:34,659
I need my flashlight.

3072
04:03:39,540 --> 04:03:44,610
I would be so bad in a scenario like this.

3073
04:03:44,610 --> 04:03:45,610
Everybody be quiet.

3074
04:03:45,610 --> 04:03:48,290
There's a monster out there that's gonna kill us.

3075
04:03:48,290 --> 04:03:49,409
Hey, hey!

3076
04:03:49,409 --> 04:03:51,129
What is it?

3077
04:03:51,129 --> 04:03:51,969
What's happening?

3078
04:03:51,969 --> 04:04:00,069
I hate when people do that.

3079
04:04:00,110 --> 04:04:01,670
I'm supposed to just wear a t-shirt

3080
04:04:01,670 --> 04:04:05,020
that's just a white t-shirt with just black print on it

3081
04:04:05,020 --> 04:04:07,510
that says free food on it

3082
04:04:07,510 --> 04:04:15,420
with an arrow pointing up to my face.

3083
04:04:15,420 --> 04:04:16,500
Like flip-flops.

3084
04:04:16,500 --> 04:04:21,719
Cause I ain't gonna be able to run around in those.

3085
04:04:27,360 --> 04:04:28,719
I can't.

3086
04:04:28,719 --> 04:04:31,399
An arrow pointing.

3087
04:04:32,709 --> 04:04:33,549
An arrow.

3088
04:04:35,610 --> 04:04:36,889
I'm not even gonna say it.

3089
04:04:44,319 --> 04:04:45,159
All right.

3090
04:04:45,159 --> 04:04:56,799
Come on dog, let's go.

3091
04:04:56,799 --> 04:04:57,639
Okay.

3092
04:04:57,639 --> 04:05:00,139
In what part of the world are we in?

3093
04:05:00,139 --> 04:05:02,459
This is like Jurassic Park leaves.

3094
04:05:02,459 --> 04:05:03,459
What looks like that?

3095
04:05:03,459 --> 04:05:09,420
And where are we?

3096
04:05:09,420 --> 04:05:10,819
How did we end up back here?

3097
04:05:10,819 --> 04:05:16,219
Wait, we did a full circle?

3098
04:05:16,219 --> 04:05:17,059
Yeah, all right.

3099
04:05:17,059 --> 04:05:20,610
Should I put the, should I cook something?

3100
04:05:20,610 --> 04:05:22,940
What do I got?

3101
04:05:22,940 --> 04:05:37,180
Trash items, wooden dolls, key items.

3102
04:05:37,180 --> 04:05:40,020
What should I do?

3103
04:05:40,020 --> 04:05:52,040
Should I start like a fire?

3104
04:05:52,040 --> 04:05:57,129
I don't understand.

3105
04:05:57,129 --> 04:06:06,299
What about in the actual tent?

3106
04:06:06,299 --> 04:06:16,979
Should I do the camera?

3107
04:06:16,979 --> 04:06:18,579
What?

3108
04:06:18,579 --> 04:06:24,649
Why is that happening?

3109
04:06:24,649 --> 04:06:25,489
Toy car.

3110
04:06:25,649 --> 04:06:30,270
Did it just?

3111
04:06:30,270 --> 04:06:31,709
Get it together, Ellis.

3112
04:06:31,709 --> 04:06:32,549
Cool.

3113
04:06:32,549 --> 04:06:34,030
Probably Peter's.

3114
04:06:34,030 --> 04:06:35,430
Maybe both.

3115
04:06:35,430 --> 04:06:36,639
What?

3116
04:06:36,639 --> 04:06:37,479
Sorry.

3117
04:06:37,479 --> 04:06:38,559
You know what to do, buddy.

3118
04:06:38,559 --> 04:06:39,399
What?

3119
04:06:39,399 --> 04:06:40,239
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3120
04:06:40,239 --> 04:06:42,739
I need my flashlight.

3121
04:06:42,739 --> 04:06:45,219
You'd do great on the forest if you weren't so stubborn.

3122
04:06:45,219 --> 04:06:46,700
Where's my flashlight?

3123
04:06:46,700 --> 04:06:49,059
There's so much junk in my pack.

3124
04:06:49,059 --> 04:06:50,459
Okay.

3125
04:06:50,459 --> 04:06:51,299
Where is it?

3126
04:06:51,299 --> 04:06:56,090
Where'd it go?

3127
04:06:56,090 --> 04:06:57,809
Hold the flashlight in your hand.

3128
04:07:00,760 --> 04:07:04,899
Where are you?

3129
04:07:04,899 --> 04:07:05,780
Don't go that far.

3130
04:07:05,780 --> 04:07:06,620
I'm not fast enough.

3131
04:07:06,620 --> 04:07:08,319
Come back.

3132
04:07:08,319 --> 04:07:10,420
Back.

3133
04:07:10,420 --> 04:07:27,899
I don't know where you're going.

3134
04:07:27,899 --> 04:07:32,120
Okay.

3135
04:07:32,120 --> 04:07:35,559
Remember, you're lost in the hills.

3136
04:07:35,559 --> 04:07:42,340
Huh?

3137
04:07:42,340 --> 04:07:44,569
Did I spin around?

3138
04:07:44,569 --> 04:07:49,959
Where's the dog?

3139
04:07:49,959 --> 04:07:51,440
Did I do a complete U-turn here?

3140
04:07:51,440 --> 04:07:52,280
There he is.

3141
04:07:58,780 --> 04:08:01,399
Okay, let's go.

3142
04:08:01,399 --> 04:08:06,610
It's gotten blue.

3143
04:08:06,610 --> 04:08:10,629
Come here, boy.

3144
04:08:10,629 --> 04:08:12,069
I want the, I want, no, I want the,

3145
04:08:12,069 --> 04:08:13,430
no, stop doing that.

3146
04:08:13,430 --> 04:08:14,270
Come here, boy.

3147
04:08:14,270 --> 04:08:16,229
I want the camcorder.

3148
04:08:16,229 --> 04:08:17,069
Heel.

3149
04:08:17,069 --> 04:08:19,090
No, I want the camcorder.

3150
04:08:19,090 --> 04:08:24,200
Where's the camcorder on my body?

3151
04:08:24,200 --> 04:08:31,649
What is this?

3152
04:08:31,649 --> 04:08:39,149
Dude, wait, what the hell?

3153
04:08:39,149 --> 04:08:46,379
Where's the camera?

3154
04:08:47,219 --> 04:08:57,829
I want to get this on film.

3155
04:08:57,829 --> 04:09:18,469
We're doing a whole lot of walking here.

3156
04:09:18,469 --> 04:09:22,420
Chapter four.

3157
04:09:22,420 --> 04:09:24,659
Each chapter is a paragraph in this book.

3158
04:09:24,659 --> 04:09:33,100
The frames are dropping?

3159
04:09:33,100 --> 04:09:37,909
I wonder, I don't think it's on my computer.

3160
04:09:37,909 --> 04:09:45,069
Maybe the internet's messed up?

3161
04:09:45,069 --> 04:09:56,899
How bad is it?

3162
04:09:56,899 --> 04:09:59,629
When you take the camera out, they drop.

3163
04:09:59,629 --> 04:10:02,760
It's probably some weird problem with the game.

3164
04:10:02,760 --> 04:10:03,600
It's not on my computer.

3165
04:10:03,600 --> 04:10:06,239
I've got a 3090.

3166
04:10:06,239 --> 04:10:07,079
Okay, here we go.

3167
04:10:07,079 --> 04:10:10,040
Time to get scared, right?

3168
04:10:10,040 --> 04:10:16,069
Chapter five, jump scares.

3169
04:10:16,069 --> 04:10:19,389
Chapter six, here comes the monster.

3170
04:10:19,389 --> 04:10:39,649
Chapter seven, home.

3171
04:10:39,649 --> 04:10:40,489
What is it, boy?

3172
04:10:40,489 --> 04:10:42,959
Hey, hey, hey, hey, too far, too far.

3173
04:10:42,959 --> 04:10:43,799
Too far.

3174
04:10:44,120 --> 04:10:50,700
Splash.

3175
04:10:50,700 --> 04:10:53,180
Okay, is this just an elaborate Slenderman?

3176
04:10:53,180 --> 04:11:05,569
Because I've gotten two of these.

3177
04:11:05,569 --> 04:11:06,809
Okay, I have two notes now.

3178
04:11:06,809 --> 04:11:14,860
Is Slenderman going to come show up in the woods?

3179
04:11:14,860 --> 04:11:21,149
Dog, dog, I need you.

3180
04:11:21,149 --> 04:11:23,579
Bullet.

3181
04:11:23,579 --> 04:11:27,569
Okay, stay with me.

3182
04:11:27,569 --> 04:11:28,409
Okay, where are we going?

3183
04:11:28,409 --> 04:11:29,889
Sorry, I'm shining that in your eyes.

3184
04:11:29,889 --> 04:11:39,459
This way?

3185
04:11:39,459 --> 04:12:01,100
Don't even think about it, game.

3186
04:12:01,100 --> 04:12:07,260
I'm just waiting to see Snape's Patronus just walk by.

3187
04:12:07,260 --> 04:12:11,930
Damn it.

3188
04:12:11,930 --> 04:12:19,530
Don't touch that.

3189
04:12:19,530 --> 04:12:20,370
Don't touch it, right?

3190
04:12:20,370 --> 04:12:24,920
Should I touch it?

3191
04:12:24,920 --> 04:12:26,159
Wait, use the camera.

3192
04:12:26,159 --> 04:12:49,700
She's a reality-shifting camera.

3193
04:12:49,700 --> 04:13:01,700
I didn't do anything.

3194
04:13:02,100 --> 04:13:05,299
Why?

3195
04:13:05,299 --> 04:13:10,610
That was dumb, and I'll tell you why.

3196
04:13:10,610 --> 04:13:12,489
The reason why that was stupid

3197
04:13:12,489 --> 04:13:17,780
is because that filled up the entire screen.

3198
04:13:17,780 --> 04:13:19,959
It didn't like pop out right here.

3199
04:13:19,959 --> 04:13:20,920
It wasn't like a little thing

3200
04:13:20,920 --> 04:13:22,399
that was right in front of me.

3201
04:13:22,399 --> 04:13:26,340
That filled up every square inch of my view.

3202
04:13:26,340 --> 04:13:32,340
Somebody actually just flashed my face with a red light.

3203
04:13:32,340 --> 04:13:36,770
Come on.

3204
04:13:36,770 --> 04:13:38,709
You got scared by cooking simulator.

3205
04:13:38,709 --> 04:13:42,049
I don't like gas, okay?

3206
04:13:42,090 --> 04:13:44,409
And I'm gonna be very upfront with you right now.

3207
04:13:44,409 --> 04:13:47,530
If I had to choose between taking a propane tank

3208
04:13:47,530 --> 04:13:48,969
and putting it in an oven

3209
04:13:48,969 --> 04:13:51,770
versus running around in the woods with your dog

3210
04:13:51,770 --> 04:13:56,030
and touch a tree, I'm picking this one.

3211
04:13:56,030 --> 04:14:00,459
I hate condensed compressed gas.

3212
04:14:00,459 --> 04:14:01,940
It's one of my biggest fears.

3213
04:14:01,940 --> 04:14:03,590
It really is.

3214
04:14:03,590 --> 04:14:04,989
I don't like ovens.

3215
04:14:04,989 --> 04:14:07,430
I don't like small contained spaces

3216
04:14:07,430 --> 04:14:09,670
that are like a foot by a foot

3217
04:14:09,670 --> 04:14:12,510
that have all this pressure built up inside of it,

3218
04:14:12,510 --> 04:14:16,180
the things ready to blow at any moment's notice.

3219
04:14:16,180 --> 04:14:17,899
No.

3220
04:14:17,899 --> 04:14:20,639
See, this shit doesn't scare me.

3221
04:14:20,639 --> 04:14:29,090
I mean, I would be terrified here.

3222
04:14:29,090 --> 04:14:32,049
This doesn't scare me

3223
04:14:32,049 --> 04:14:36,729
the way that a compressed gas in a container does.

3224
04:14:36,729 --> 04:14:44,860
Is it a person?

3225
04:14:44,860 --> 04:14:46,469
Yeah, actually.

3226
04:14:46,469 --> 04:14:47,489
You know if anyone's ever done

3227
04:14:47,489 --> 04:14:52,069
any construction work out here?

3228
04:14:52,069 --> 04:14:52,909
The oven.

3229
04:14:52,909 --> 04:15:07,430
Of course, concrete, foundations or trenches.

3230
04:15:07,430 --> 04:15:09,430
I know what I'm seeing landing.

3231
04:15:09,430 --> 04:15:11,590
Zero idea how ovens work.

3232
04:15:11,590 --> 04:15:13,149
I know how an oven works.

3233
04:15:14,729 --> 04:15:15,690
I don't like it.

3234
04:15:15,690 --> 04:15:22,299
I don't like gas.

3235
04:15:22,299 --> 04:15:23,780
Okay, you can't tell me.

3236
04:15:23,780 --> 04:15:25,200
I know we all know that it's safe.

3237
04:15:25,200 --> 04:15:26,879
We all know that it's fine.

3238
04:15:26,879 --> 04:15:27,719
Everything's fine.

3239
04:15:27,719 --> 04:15:29,659
But if just pull yourself out of the world for a second

3240
04:15:29,659 --> 04:15:31,540
and look down at the world

3241
04:15:31,540 --> 04:15:35,969
and think of a propane tank, what's going on in there.

3242
04:15:35,969 --> 04:15:39,100
Think of like just a propane tank.

3243
04:15:39,100 --> 04:15:40,420
If you stop thinking about like,

3244
04:15:40,420 --> 04:15:43,500
oh, it's so safe, it's scientific, right?

3245
04:15:43,500 --> 04:15:47,649
It's kind of fucking terrifying.

3246
04:15:47,649 --> 04:15:51,319
It's this tank that somehow is holding

3247
04:15:51,319 --> 04:15:55,530
like pounds and pounds of pressure inside

3248
04:15:55,530 --> 04:15:58,370
that if it decides to, if you heat it up or you pit it

3249
04:15:58,370 --> 04:16:06,989
or if it's too much pressure builds up, the thing explodes.

3250
04:16:06,989 --> 04:16:13,250
Oh my God, what the hell am I supposed to do about this?

3251
04:16:13,250 --> 04:16:32,120
There's only like four combinations this could be.

3252
04:16:32,120 --> 04:16:39,860
Locked.

3253
04:16:39,860 --> 04:16:42,620
Derma creates a fire and cooks over it.

3254
04:16:42,620 --> 04:16:44,500
Yeah, I'm not, fire is fine.

3255
04:16:44,500 --> 04:16:50,319
Fire is not trapped inside.

3256
04:16:50,319 --> 04:16:55,620
Fire is not trapped inside of a container.

3257
04:16:56,219 --> 04:16:57,780
It's like all the warning labels too.

3258
04:16:57,780 --> 04:17:00,500
Like fire, you know fire's warning label?

3259
04:17:00,500 --> 04:17:03,340
It burns out, be careful.

3260
04:17:03,340 --> 04:17:06,500
Propane tanks have this like huge gigantic

3261
04:17:06,500 --> 04:17:08,020
like just don't fucking touch it.

3262
04:17:08,020 --> 04:17:08,959
Don't go near it.

3263
04:17:08,959 --> 04:17:11,219
Look at all the warnings are big red labels all over it.

3264
04:17:11,219 --> 04:17:13,180
Be careful, this is gonna explode.

3265
04:17:13,180 --> 04:17:14,659
Like fire is just like it's gonna burn

3266
04:17:14,659 --> 04:17:15,500
and it's gonna burn, it's gonna hurt you.

3267
04:17:15,500 --> 04:17:17,500
It hurts, it's burning.

3268
04:17:17,500 --> 04:17:26,579
I don't like it, I don't.

3269
04:17:26,579 --> 04:17:28,340
And I know I just described the same warnings

3270
04:17:28,340 --> 04:17:32,809
that are on the side of a public pool, right?

3271
04:17:32,809 --> 04:17:33,829
Like don't dive.

3272
04:17:33,829 --> 04:17:35,110
Watch that, you're gonna break your neck.

3273
04:17:35,110 --> 04:17:36,430
Don't do anything crazy, don't do anything stupid.

3274
04:17:36,430 --> 04:17:37,270
It's too deep.

3275
04:17:37,270 --> 04:17:43,770
I know that like all these warning labels.

3276
04:17:43,770 --> 04:17:47,850
I'm just saying.

3277
04:17:47,850 --> 04:17:52,379
Are you afraid of humans?

3278
04:17:52,379 --> 04:18:12,360
Most of all, empty truck.

3279
04:18:12,360 --> 04:18:15,799
Dude, Elden Ring comes out in like 14 days or something,

3280
04:18:15,799 --> 04:18:18,790
right, are you kidding me?

3281
04:18:18,790 --> 04:18:20,260
What's that?

3282
04:18:20,260 --> 04:18:21,100
Toothpaste?

3283
04:18:21,100 --> 04:18:23,200
Candy wrapper, really?

3284
04:18:23,200 --> 04:18:24,879
Go on, see if you can find something else.

3285
04:18:24,879 --> 04:18:34,219
The door just opened.

3286
04:18:34,219 --> 04:18:36,260
What do you got?

3287
04:18:36,260 --> 04:18:44,620
Don't, you're, this is a ghost in here.

3288
04:18:44,620 --> 04:18:47,459
What's that?

3289
04:18:47,459 --> 04:18:50,000
Ooh, a tape.

3290
04:18:50,000 --> 04:19:02,479
Let's see, is that, it's Peter.

3291
04:19:02,479 --> 04:19:08,590
I think I didn't see that.

3292
04:19:08,590 --> 04:19:10,879
The me talking?

3293
04:19:10,879 --> 04:19:14,389
It's called Lanning.

3294
04:19:14,389 --> 04:19:15,590
Ellis to base.

3295
04:19:15,590 --> 04:19:17,829
Peter didn't run away, he was kidnapped.

3296
04:19:17,829 --> 04:19:18,829
I found a tape.

3297
04:19:18,829 --> 04:19:20,670
It shows the man who did it.

3298
04:19:20,670 --> 04:19:28,110
Me.

3299
04:19:28,110 --> 04:19:30,110
Yeah, those tapes, they make things appear,

3300
04:19:30,110 --> 04:19:33,309
but there's no time, Lanning.

3301
04:19:33,309 --> 04:19:36,309
We have to find the kid, he's in serious danger.

3302
04:19:36,309 --> 04:19:41,860
Ellis, even?

3303
04:19:41,860 --> 04:19:43,659
We don't have much choice.

3304
04:19:43,659 --> 04:19:44,500
Look, I won't do this.

3305
04:19:44,500 --> 04:19:46,899
It sounds like the guy from Trail of Park Boys.

3306
04:19:46,899 --> 04:19:48,139
I'll wait for you to catch up.

3307
04:19:48,139 --> 04:19:54,729
Oh, Ricky, yeah, you're a fucking idiot.

3308
04:19:54,770 --> 04:19:56,190
What's his name?

3309
04:19:56,190 --> 04:19:58,819
He was shot in those trenches I saw earlier.

3310
04:19:58,819 --> 04:19:59,659
That's what, what's his name?

3311
04:19:59,659 --> 04:20:01,120
Come on, boy.

3312
04:20:01,120 --> 04:20:02,000
Lahey, yeah.

3313
04:20:05,340 --> 04:20:10,700
All right, let's keep going, man, let's go.

3314
04:20:10,700 --> 04:20:39,889
Gonna find that kid.

3315
04:20:39,889 --> 04:20:42,690
Back here again, okay.

3316
04:20:42,690 --> 04:20:45,020
So I gotta do something with the car.

3317
04:20:45,020 --> 04:20:46,340
I gotta film the car.

3318
04:20:49,100 --> 04:20:51,819
The doors keep opening and closing.

3319
04:20:51,819 --> 04:20:52,659
What's that?

3320
04:20:52,659 --> 04:20:54,260
What's going on up there?

3321
04:20:54,260 --> 04:20:57,750
Did I film the car?

3322
04:20:57,750 --> 04:21:00,299
Otto!

3323
04:21:00,299 --> 04:21:01,139
What's that?

3324
04:21:01,139 --> 04:21:06,540
That's the tree, right?

3325
04:21:06,540 --> 04:21:07,379
Hey, can you find some,

3326
04:21:07,379 --> 04:21:25,700
can you find some place snake on the phone?

3327
04:21:25,700 --> 04:21:27,100
It's hard to, okay.

3328
04:21:27,100 --> 04:21:27,979
I love these controllers,

3329
04:21:27,979 --> 04:21:29,139
but sometimes it's hard to grip

3330
04:21:29,139 --> 04:21:32,219
and press buttons at the same time.

3331
04:21:32,219 --> 04:21:54,969
Oh, cool, let's go.

3332
04:21:54,969 --> 04:21:59,420
It's so hard to see this.

3333
04:21:59,420 --> 04:22:07,940
Did I go through the wall?

3334
04:22:07,940 --> 04:22:09,579
This is taking so much to even see this.

3335
04:22:09,579 --> 04:22:12,819
I feel like I'm shit-faced right now.

3336
04:22:12,819 --> 04:22:14,979
Just leaning in, closing one eye,

3337
04:22:14,979 --> 04:22:15,899
looking at the phone.

3338
04:22:15,899 --> 04:22:31,569
Like, I feel like I am trashed.

3339
04:22:31,569 --> 04:22:32,930
I'm gonna get jump-scared, right?

3340
04:22:32,930 --> 04:22:48,739
That's like where this, how this becomes funny.

3341
04:22:48,739 --> 04:22:52,940
I can't see.

3342
04:22:52,940 --> 04:22:57,809
What a boring stream this is right here.

3343
04:22:57,809 --> 04:23:02,540
I can do this on my own, with my own phone, right?

3344
04:23:02,540 --> 04:23:06,819
Oh, maybe not any index controllers.

3345
04:23:06,819 --> 04:23:13,600
You just fucked up my whole game.

3346
04:23:13,600 --> 04:23:15,040
Hope everything's going well.

3347
04:23:15,040 --> 04:23:20,540
Call me when you have a minute.

3348
04:23:20,540 --> 04:23:23,450
All right, come on.

3349
04:23:23,450 --> 04:23:29,120
What do I need to do here?

3350
04:23:29,120 --> 04:23:30,399
You bought the index.

3351
04:23:30,399 --> 04:23:35,610
The index is the best one.

3352
04:23:35,610 --> 04:23:37,489
Now, I don't care how many times they show the commercial

3353
04:23:37,489 --> 04:23:38,610
of like the people in the living room

3354
04:23:38,610 --> 04:23:41,610
like dancing with their fucking wireless.

3355
04:23:41,610 --> 04:23:47,540
No, this is the best one.

3356
04:23:47,540 --> 04:23:49,579
And yes, it's a thousand dollars.

3357
04:23:49,579 --> 04:23:51,840
Okay, whatever it is.

3358
04:23:51,840 --> 04:23:53,600
Nobody has that much fun in VR.

3359
04:23:53,600 --> 04:24:01,200
No one does.

3360
04:24:01,200 --> 04:24:04,129
It's nice to not have wires though.

3361
04:24:04,129 --> 04:24:04,969
I know.

3362
04:24:04,969 --> 04:24:07,260
And it's probably awesome, but you know what?

3363
04:24:07,260 --> 04:24:10,540
I'm gonna stick with my purchase.

3364
04:24:10,540 --> 04:24:13,520
Give me the camera.

3365
04:24:13,520 --> 04:24:19,969
What am I supposed to do?

3366
04:24:19,969 --> 04:24:25,870
Something to do with the truck, has to be.

3367
04:24:25,870 --> 04:24:27,530
Person?

3368
04:24:27,530 --> 04:24:35,659
I need to figure out what the combination of that lock is.

3369
04:24:35,659 --> 04:24:46,040
You nice butt crack, what?

3370
04:24:46,040 --> 04:24:49,860
Millionaire can't afford a Quest 2.

3371
04:24:49,860 --> 04:24:57,420
I already bought, guys, I have a, I'm not gonna buy.

3372
04:24:57,420 --> 04:25:01,090
PS4 four times.

3373
04:25:01,090 --> 04:25:06,100
I have a Vive that is in a box in my closet.

3374
04:25:06,100 --> 04:25:07,899
I now own an index.

3375
04:25:07,899 --> 04:25:11,700
Do you want me to buy a Quest?

3376
04:25:11,700 --> 04:25:13,219
I'm the sucker at that point.

3377
04:25:13,219 --> 04:25:17,530
Do you understand?

3378
04:25:17,530 --> 04:25:23,780
I'm not gonna buy a like $800 GTA V again.

3379
04:25:23,780 --> 04:25:36,510
I'm not gonna buy the, I have it already.

3380
04:25:36,510 --> 04:25:39,510
Where is it?

3381
04:25:39,510 --> 04:25:40,350
Right here?

3382
04:25:40,350 --> 04:25:49,090
Oh, what is it?

3383
04:25:49,090 --> 04:25:52,799
What is it?

3384
04:25:52,799 --> 04:25:53,620
Where is it?

3385
04:25:53,620 --> 04:26:03,909
The video was shot around here somewhere.

3386
04:26:03,909 --> 04:26:06,989
Come on, where is it?

3387
04:26:06,989 --> 04:26:07,829
Let's see it.

3388
04:26:07,829 --> 04:26:15,819
Where?

3389
04:26:15,819 --> 04:26:40,010
Wait, lay the tape.

3390
04:26:40,010 --> 04:26:45,840
It's right here.

3391
04:26:45,840 --> 04:26:51,610
So it's facing this way.

3392
04:26:51,610 --> 04:26:54,129
He's going, hey, hey, ballsy move kid.

3393
04:26:54,129 --> 04:27:01,670
Right here.

3394
04:27:01,670 --> 04:27:05,520
Okay, is there a rock?

3395
04:27:05,520 --> 04:27:15,510
Was there a rock?

3396
04:27:16,030 --> 04:27:21,489
Just guess the code.

3397
04:27:21,489 --> 04:27:23,409
It's gotta be a rock on the ground, right?

3398
04:27:23,409 --> 04:27:26,219
It's like, hey, there's a ballsy move, Peter.

3399
04:27:26,219 --> 04:27:41,309
Right here.

3400
04:27:41,309 --> 04:27:48,319
What is that?

3401
04:27:48,319 --> 04:27:50,750
What's happening?

3402
04:27:50,750 --> 04:27:52,370
I swear he played something like this before.

3403
04:27:52,370 --> 04:27:54,520
Yeah, Outlast.

3404
04:27:54,520 --> 04:27:57,780
Brute force, please.

3405
04:27:57,780 --> 04:28:02,139
Lay the tape forward.

3406
04:28:02,139 --> 04:28:06,020
Buy me a what?

3407
04:28:06,020 --> 04:28:09,739
Stop saying Peter and help me with this fucking video game.

3408
04:28:09,739 --> 04:28:12,700
Stop, it's half of the chat.

3409
04:28:12,700 --> 04:28:15,139
All I see is butt cracking beater.

3410
04:28:15,139 --> 04:28:19,739
What, help me.

3411
04:28:19,739 --> 04:28:23,969
You guys got over that a year or two ago as well.

3412
04:28:23,969 --> 04:28:25,110
It went so fast.

3413
04:28:25,989 --> 04:28:29,840
Peter.

3414
04:28:29,840 --> 04:28:33,200
Call 911 on your phone?

3415
04:28:33,200 --> 04:28:35,319
You need to go back.

3416
04:28:35,319 --> 04:28:36,159
Find the rock.

3417
04:28:36,159 --> 04:28:37,000
Yep, yep, yep.

3418
04:28:37,000 --> 04:28:38,149
Find the rock.

3419
04:28:38,149 --> 04:28:48,659
Lay the tape.

3420
04:28:48,659 --> 04:28:51,280
Tree falls in the forest.

3421
04:28:51,280 --> 04:28:59,579
There's Peter.

3422
04:28:59,579 --> 04:29:06,459
What's going on?

3423
04:29:06,459 --> 04:29:11,379
Okay.

3424
04:29:11,379 --> 04:29:14,899
Is he peeing?

3425
04:29:14,899 --> 04:29:19,190
If the tree falls and nobody's around, call Peter.

3426
04:29:19,190 --> 04:29:35,889
Press right trigger to enter what?

3427
04:29:35,889 --> 04:29:39,469
Tree?

3428
04:29:39,469 --> 04:29:41,149
Buttcrack Peter is the code.

3429
04:29:41,149 --> 04:29:52,520
Press left trigger to enter pregnancy mode.

3430
04:29:52,520 --> 04:29:57,180
Okay.

3431
04:29:58,180 --> 04:30:00,430
What, like.

3432
04:30:00,430 --> 04:30:06,840
Oh yeah dude, just press left trigger.

3433
04:30:06,840 --> 04:30:08,760
What would that mode even entail?

3434
04:30:08,760 --> 04:30:14,889
What are you talking about?

3435
04:30:14,889 --> 04:30:19,790
I'm going to look up the answer.

3436
04:30:19,790 --> 04:30:22,360
Why is he so bad at this?

3437
04:30:22,360 --> 04:30:26,040
I don't know what the game wants me to do.

3438
04:30:26,040 --> 04:30:35,680
I guess I'm going to go this way.

3439
04:30:35,680 --> 04:30:37,399
Press A and B.

3440
04:30:37,399 --> 04:30:40,079
No, this the tree fell.

3441
04:30:40,079 --> 04:30:41,559
We just told you the answer.

3442
04:30:41,559 --> 04:30:42,739
Press left trigger.

3443
04:30:42,739 --> 04:30:44,979
Do your tummy dance.

3444
04:30:44,979 --> 04:30:46,620
Look down at the ground.

3445
04:30:46,620 --> 04:30:54,760
Remember the code is in the truck.

3446
04:30:54,760 --> 04:30:55,600
Rewind them.

3447
04:30:55,600 --> 04:30:58,299
The only way to get out of this is to go back and

3448
04:30:58,299 --> 04:30:59,860
try appearing offline.

3449
04:30:59,860 --> 04:31:01,260
Use the camera.

3450
04:31:01,260 --> 04:31:03,719
The dog might find with the stuff.

3451
04:31:03,719 --> 04:31:05,340
Left trigger, press A and B.

3452
04:31:05,340 --> 04:31:14,290
Look behind you.

3453
04:31:14,290 --> 04:31:16,149
Where is this rock that I pick up?

3454
04:31:16,149 --> 04:31:29,909
Why would they show that?

3455
04:31:29,909 --> 04:31:35,000
What the hell?

3456
04:31:35,000 --> 04:31:53,120
Play the tape while looking down at the ground.

3457
04:31:53,120 --> 04:32:00,729
Wait, where'd it go?

3458
04:32:00,729 --> 04:32:10,200
Pause it.

3459
04:32:14,059 --> 04:32:16,219
What the hell is this game?

3460
04:32:16,219 --> 04:32:20,559
All right, find him.

3461
04:32:20,559 --> 04:32:22,120
We're moving, we're moving, we're moving, we're moving,

3462
04:32:22,120 --> 04:32:38,780
we're moving, we're moving, we're moving.

3463
04:32:38,780 --> 04:32:39,620
What'd you got?

3464
04:32:39,620 --> 04:32:48,809
Something?

3465
04:32:48,809 --> 04:32:56,799
Weren't we already here?

3466
04:32:56,799 --> 04:32:57,639
We just, we already did.

3467
04:32:57,639 --> 04:33:03,959
We didn't find him at all.

3468
04:33:03,959 --> 04:33:06,159
What the hell?

3469
04:33:07,139 --> 04:33:09,000
You sniffed the baseball and then you brought us

3470
04:33:09,000 --> 04:33:57,479
back to the truck?

3471
04:33:57,479 --> 04:34:06,689
Where's the, it didn't fall.

3472
04:34:06,689 --> 04:34:10,330
What the hell?

3473
04:34:10,330 --> 04:34:16,520
This is gonna make a sick vlog.

3474
04:34:16,520 --> 04:34:20,060
Your dog needs more strength.

3475
04:34:20,060 --> 04:34:21,479
I beg you, you press left trigger.

3476
04:34:21,479 --> 04:34:29,270
The code is in the truck.

3477
04:34:29,270 --> 04:34:39,970
Where do you see a code?

3478
04:34:39,970 --> 04:34:47,040
I don't see a code.

3479
04:34:47,040 --> 04:34:47,880
You just lied to me.

3480
04:34:47,880 --> 04:34:58,729
That's all right.

3481
04:34:58,729 --> 04:35:01,090
Honk the horn.

3482
04:35:01,090 --> 04:35:03,220
Get the truck in the same view with the tape.

3483
04:35:03,220 --> 04:35:09,889
The problem is, it's hard to see what's on that tape.

3484
04:35:09,889 --> 04:35:12,220
You see, I've got a complaint.

3485
04:35:12,220 --> 04:35:15,349
Here's my complaint.

3486
04:35:15,349 --> 04:35:18,310
Like I, VR it's kind of hard to see anyways.

3487
04:35:18,310 --> 04:35:20,430
It's the, your vision is kind of distorted

3488
04:35:20,430 --> 04:35:22,119
in a way anyways.

3489
04:35:22,119 --> 04:35:27,139
But like having to look at a video inside of VR,

3490
04:35:27,139 --> 04:35:29,900
like it, it's almost impossible to make out

3491
04:35:29,900 --> 04:35:32,020
what's going on here.

3492
04:35:32,020 --> 04:35:33,779
It's like, it's hard to tell.

3493
04:35:33,779 --> 04:35:36,720
What, what even am I watching here?

3494
04:35:36,720 --> 04:35:38,310
Like, what is that?

3495
04:35:38,310 --> 04:35:40,950
It's hard to even see what that is.

3496
04:35:40,950 --> 04:35:46,220
That's a tree falling, but what's underneath that?

3497
04:35:46,220 --> 04:35:52,669
What the hell is that?

3498
04:35:52,669 --> 04:35:53,509
What is that thing?

3499
04:35:53,509 --> 04:36:00,279
It's like a campfire, campsite.

3500
04:36:00,319 --> 04:36:07,799
He really does hate VR.

3501
04:36:07,799 --> 04:36:20,459
Use the x-ray function.

3502
04:36:20,459 --> 04:36:35,150
X-ray on the truck.

3503
04:36:35,150 --> 04:36:38,040
I don't see anything here.

3504
04:36:38,040 --> 04:36:42,580
I got nothing here.

3505
04:36:42,580 --> 04:36:44,779
Use the, can we get a diaper cam?

3506
04:36:44,779 --> 04:36:46,599
Give the dog the camera for fuck's sake.

3507
04:36:46,599 --> 04:36:48,560
Put the camera down here.

3508
04:36:48,560 --> 04:36:50,680
You have to time it right.

3509
04:36:50,680 --> 04:37:02,970
Collect all eight, pause it when the tree falls.

3510
04:37:02,970 --> 04:37:04,209
I can't even see.

3511
04:37:04,209 --> 04:37:12,500
What am I even looking for?

3512
04:37:12,500 --> 04:37:13,340
Is that it?

3513
04:37:13,340 --> 04:37:19,619
No, it's too thin.

3514
04:37:19,619 --> 04:37:22,409
He's doing this on purpose.

3515
04:37:22,409 --> 04:37:25,750
I don't even know what I'm supposed to be doing.

3516
04:37:25,750 --> 04:37:30,790
Line it up, stop looking at chat and use your tiny brain.

3517
04:37:34,419 --> 04:37:36,580
I don't even know what I'm looking at.

3518
04:37:36,580 --> 04:37:38,259
I don't know what that is.

3519
04:37:38,259 --> 04:37:40,619
Cause I, you see on your screen,

3520
04:37:40,619 --> 04:37:44,029
I've got like 480p in both eyes.

3521
04:37:44,029 --> 04:37:46,130
And then this is blurred to shit.

3522
04:37:46,130 --> 04:37:48,619
What is that?

3523
04:37:48,619 --> 04:37:50,659
Is that a bench?

3524
04:37:50,659 --> 04:37:52,900
I can't, it's blurred out.

3525
04:37:52,900 --> 04:37:57,369
I can't see what this is.

3526
04:37:57,369 --> 04:37:59,540
It looks like a hot bench.

3527
04:37:59,540 --> 04:38:03,959
It's like a bench that has like fire on it.

3528
04:38:03,959 --> 04:38:13,049
That's the truck.

3529
04:38:13,049 --> 04:38:20,919
That's not the truck.

3530
04:38:20,919 --> 04:38:24,139
Fucking tree is that.

3531
04:38:24,139 --> 04:38:58,700
It's from behind the truck.

3532
04:38:59,700 --> 04:39:03,020
Guys, I don't think that's the truck.

3533
04:39:03,020 --> 04:39:10,779
It's the right side of the truck.

3534
04:39:10,779 --> 04:39:12,580
Wouldn't it be showing up at this point though?

3535
04:39:12,580 --> 04:39:14,299
Seriously?

3536
04:39:14,299 --> 04:39:29,529
It's not the right side of the truck.

3537
04:39:29,529 --> 04:39:33,099
I don't think this is where I need to be.

3538
04:39:33,099 --> 04:39:38,180
Go back to the baby.

3539
04:39:38,180 --> 04:39:39,580
Have you gotten to the dog upgrade?

3540
04:39:39,580 --> 04:39:42,159
The chat's going too fast.

3541
04:39:42,159 --> 04:39:45,540
You're reaching abandoned.

3542
04:39:45,540 --> 04:39:53,569
Give the dog the baseball scent again.

3543
04:39:53,569 --> 04:39:58,909
Where is this?

3544
04:39:58,909 --> 04:39:59,729
Take a look.

3545
04:39:59,729 --> 04:40:02,090
What do you think?

3546
04:40:02,090 --> 04:40:02,930
What do you got?

3547
04:40:02,930 --> 04:40:05,529
What do you got for us?

3548
04:40:05,529 --> 04:40:07,060
Anything?

3549
04:40:07,060 --> 04:40:12,419
No?

3550
04:40:12,419 --> 04:40:15,979
He doesn't want to do it.

3551
04:40:15,979 --> 04:40:16,819
Proceed.

3552
04:40:16,819 --> 04:40:17,759
Just, okay, please everybody spam that.

3553
04:40:17,759 --> 04:40:20,369
Copy positive, please.

3554
04:40:20,409 --> 04:40:22,540
That's the only thing I want to see in the chat.

3555
04:40:22,540 --> 04:40:29,700
Cause I need to read it one word at a time.

3556
04:40:29,700 --> 04:40:32,540
There's a fallen tree that you saw.

3557
04:40:32,540 --> 04:40:37,180
The abandoned, unfortunately.

3558
04:40:37,180 --> 04:40:39,029
There's a fallen tree.

3559
04:40:39,029 --> 04:40:39,869
Pause the recording.

3560
04:40:39,869 --> 04:40:42,340
There's a fallen tree.

3561
04:40:42,340 --> 04:40:44,580
Reign.

3562
04:40:44,580 --> 04:40:45,419
Is it?

3563
04:40:45,419 --> 04:40:46,459
I can't.

3564
04:40:46,459 --> 04:40:47,819
I'm coming out.

3565
04:40:47,819 --> 04:40:48,659
I'm coming out.

3566
04:40:48,659 --> 04:40:52,099
I need to read this.

3567
04:40:52,099 --> 04:40:55,819
What does it say?

3568
04:40:55,819 --> 04:40:57,180
There's a fallen tree that you saw

3569
04:40:57,180 --> 04:40:58,860
at the beginning of the last recording.

3570
04:40:58,860 --> 04:40:59,939
Play it and pause the recording

3571
04:40:59,939 --> 04:41:00,900
when the tree is still standing.

3572
04:41:00,900 --> 04:41:03,099
Unfortunately, you will find out that the bridge

3573
04:41:03,099 --> 04:41:04,740
behind the tree has been destroyed.

3574
04:41:04,740 --> 04:41:08,799
Thus you have to go back to the starting point.

3575
04:41:08,799 --> 04:41:10,560
There's a fallen tree that you saw

3576
04:41:10,560 --> 04:41:11,560
at the beginning of the recording.

3577
04:41:11,560 --> 04:41:12,400
Play it and pause the recording

3578
04:41:12,400 --> 04:41:15,020
when the tree is still standing.

3579
04:41:15,020 --> 04:41:18,779
Where's the tree?

3580
04:41:18,779 --> 04:41:22,560
You will find an abandoned small gauge train.

3581
04:41:22,560 --> 04:41:26,470
What train?

3582
04:41:26,470 --> 04:41:36,700
I didn't even see a train?

3583
04:41:36,700 --> 04:41:38,229
Okay.

3584
04:41:38,229 --> 04:41:42,169
I'm gonna, apparently I'm gonna look for a train.

3585
04:41:42,169 --> 04:41:51,529
We're going to go find a train.

3586
04:41:51,529 --> 04:41:52,369
Okay.

3587
04:41:52,369 --> 04:42:00,340
I'm leaving this goddamn area.

3588
04:42:00,340 --> 04:42:17,369
The sound is gone again.

3589
04:42:17,369 --> 04:42:18,849
He's in training mode.

3590
04:42:19,849 --> 04:42:22,020
Okay.

3591
04:42:23,939 --> 04:42:24,779
Okay.

3592
04:42:24,779 --> 04:42:29,830
I'm ready.

3593
04:42:29,830 --> 04:42:30,650
Excuse me.

3594
04:42:30,650 --> 04:42:31,709
I can't see with my glasses.

3595
04:42:32,189 --> 04:42:34,939
The whole thing is pitch black.

3596
04:42:34,939 --> 04:42:36,299
Go find the tree.

3597
04:42:36,299 --> 04:42:37,139
Oh, sonny.

3598
04:42:37,139 --> 04:42:40,200
I don't know if I'm glad it's blurry in VR,

3599
04:42:40,200 --> 04:42:43,380
but you know, at least we have one fucking ounce of light.

3600
04:42:43,380 --> 04:42:46,970
Ooh, good thing I can see where the tree is.

3601
04:42:46,970 --> 04:42:52,950
Find a tree.

3602
04:42:52,950 --> 04:42:54,790
I think it could be this one.

3603
04:43:12,080 --> 04:43:12,919
Okay.

3604
04:43:12,919 --> 04:43:16,639
So it's not this one.

3605
04:43:16,639 --> 04:43:19,220
There ain't been no train, guys.

3606
04:43:19,220 --> 04:43:20,319
Okay.

3607
04:43:20,319 --> 04:43:23,340
There hasn't been a single solitary choo choo train

3608
04:43:23,340 --> 04:43:26,740
the whole time we've been playing.

3609
04:43:26,740 --> 04:43:29,049
That tree does not fall.

3610
04:43:29,049 --> 04:43:30,209
Where is this train?

3611
04:43:30,209 --> 04:43:31,450
You'll find an abandoned train.

3612
04:43:31,450 --> 04:43:32,869
And where am I supposed to find the...

3613
04:43:32,869 --> 04:43:34,290
I'm just gonna do two, one, one, three,

3614
04:43:34,290 --> 04:43:35,130
because that's what people said.

3615
04:43:35,130 --> 04:43:36,330
I don't even care.

3616
04:43:36,330 --> 04:43:37,169
Just hurry up.

3617
04:43:37,169 --> 04:43:42,169
Just go.

3618
04:43:42,169 --> 04:43:43,409
Tree, not train.

3619
04:43:43,409 --> 04:43:45,450
What?

3620
04:43:45,450 --> 04:43:46,270
Two, one, one, three.

3621
04:43:46,270 --> 04:43:54,040
I'm just fucking putting it in.

3622
04:43:54,040 --> 04:43:55,520
Give me this goddamn thing.

3623
04:43:55,520 --> 04:44:01,819
Two, one, one, three.

3624
04:44:01,819 --> 04:44:02,840
It's open.

3625
04:44:02,840 --> 04:44:03,680
Fuck off.

3626
04:44:03,680 --> 04:44:08,000
I'm going in here.

3627
04:44:08,000 --> 04:44:24,369
We aren't even doing that part.

3628
04:44:24,369 --> 04:44:34,860
Now what?

3629
04:44:34,860 --> 04:44:39,569
Do I have anything to put in there?

3630
04:44:40,290 --> 04:44:53,810
I need like wires or fuses or something.

3631
04:44:53,810 --> 04:44:54,650
What?

3632
04:44:54,650 --> 04:45:09,299
Was that the real dog?

3633
04:45:09,299 --> 04:45:14,200
This dog is so happy.

3634
04:45:14,200 --> 04:45:15,439
I didn't do anything for me.

3635
04:45:15,439 --> 04:45:16,279
All right.

3636
04:45:16,279 --> 04:45:18,000
Where's this train?

3637
04:45:18,000 --> 04:45:19,810
Where's the train?

3638
04:45:19,810 --> 04:45:21,569
There should have been a hundred trains by now.

3639
04:45:21,569 --> 04:45:23,950
That liar.

3640
04:45:23,950 --> 04:45:27,650
What do you think about scuba divers and their gear?

3641
04:45:27,650 --> 04:45:28,490
It's weird.

3642
04:45:28,490 --> 04:45:29,310
I don't know.

3643
04:45:29,310 --> 04:45:32,439
It's too much pressure.

3644
04:45:32,439 --> 04:45:43,380
Is that the tree?

3645
04:45:43,380 --> 04:45:46,720
Is that the tree right there?

3646
04:45:46,720 --> 04:45:53,830
I don't think so.

3647
04:45:53,830 --> 04:45:55,909
Find the railroad.

3648
04:45:55,909 --> 04:46:02,560
I kind of been walking in a circle.

3649
04:46:02,560 --> 04:46:12,830
Can I get up there?

3650
04:46:12,830 --> 04:46:15,779
I'm back at the goddamn truck again.

3651
04:46:15,779 --> 04:46:20,580
I swear to God.

3652
04:46:20,580 --> 04:46:23,060
That is, that was the tree.

3653
04:46:23,060 --> 04:46:26,520
What do you mean that's the tree?

3654
04:46:26,520 --> 04:46:28,009
No, it's not.

3655
04:46:28,009 --> 04:46:30,799
Somebody said progressive or state farm.

3656
04:46:30,799 --> 04:46:33,200
Get out of here with your corporate bullshit.

3657
04:46:33,200 --> 04:46:34,040
This is the tree.

3658
04:46:34,040 --> 04:47:10,840
You're telling me this is the tree.

3659
04:47:10,840 --> 04:47:23,819
You have to own an air fryer for this part.

3660
04:47:23,819 --> 04:47:25,819
What am I looking at?

3661
04:47:25,819 --> 04:47:31,450
I don't get it.

3662
04:47:31,450 --> 04:47:32,290
Pull it.

3663
04:47:32,290 --> 04:47:34,759
Ah.

3664
04:47:34,759 --> 04:47:37,889
I don't get it.

3665
04:47:37,889 --> 04:47:43,430
Go back to the car and walk straight back from the car.

3666
04:47:43,430 --> 04:47:55,450
Go back to the car and go straight back from the car.

3667
04:47:55,450 --> 04:47:58,540
You have to prove you own an air fryer.

3668
04:47:58,540 --> 04:48:05,639
Aye, aye, aye.

3669
04:48:05,639 --> 04:48:15,389
So I'm gonna go back this way from the truck.

3670
04:48:15,389 --> 04:48:16,229
Where am I?

3671
04:48:16,229 --> 04:48:19,909
Here?

3672
04:48:19,909 --> 04:48:24,700
Am I going the right way?

3673
04:48:24,700 --> 04:48:54,119
Back of the truck.

3674
04:48:54,119 --> 04:48:56,990
I'm going back.

3675
04:48:56,990 --> 04:49:01,319
I'm going back before the truck.

3676
04:49:01,319 --> 04:49:02,200
Take care now.

3677
04:49:02,200 --> 04:49:11,400
Bye bye then.

3678
04:49:11,400 --> 04:49:29,040
Now what?

3679
04:49:29,040 --> 04:49:32,229
Is this right?

3680
04:49:32,229 --> 04:49:41,400
To do a BLJ, that's Mario stuff.

3681
04:49:41,400 --> 04:49:42,240
Well, I've already been,

3682
04:49:42,240 --> 04:49:45,270
I thought I was writing in a notebook.

3683
04:49:45,270 --> 04:49:47,209
I thought that was like, I'm writing in a notepad.

3684
04:49:47,209 --> 04:50:07,029
What is this?

3685
04:50:07,029 --> 04:50:07,950
Is that, that's it?

3686
04:50:07,950 --> 04:50:10,720
That's all that was here?

3687
04:50:10,720 --> 04:50:11,560
That can't be, right?

3688
04:50:11,560 --> 04:50:14,950
I gotta, it's gotta be here.

3689
04:50:14,950 --> 04:50:18,509
Do you even do anything in this entire game?

3690
04:50:18,509 --> 04:50:26,439
I don't know.

3691
04:50:26,439 --> 04:50:30,860
They implemented this like reality shifting camera.

3692
04:50:31,659 --> 04:50:33,099
I kinda just wanted Slender Man to chase me around the woods

3693
04:50:33,099 --> 04:50:37,459
with like a machete in his hand.

3694
04:50:37,459 --> 04:50:50,029
And now I'm lost again.

3695
04:50:50,029 --> 04:50:54,040
There's nothing else here.

3696
04:50:54,040 --> 04:50:56,310
Please Among Us VR, I'm begging you.

3697
04:50:56,310 --> 04:51:11,229
I'm not, I'm not gonna even say anything.

3698
04:51:11,229 --> 04:51:12,349
Where am I even going?

3699
04:51:12,349 --> 04:51:13,959
Is this correct?

3700
04:51:13,959 --> 04:51:17,909
No, this is just a circle.

3701
04:51:17,909 --> 04:51:19,119
Please go out and play Among Us.

3702
04:51:19,119 --> 04:51:20,040
That shit's not gonna come out

3703
04:51:20,040 --> 04:51:23,430
till probably like June or something, guys.

3704
04:51:23,430 --> 04:51:24,790
Focus on the task at hand.

3705
04:51:24,790 --> 04:51:29,860
Finding me in this convoluted ass game

3706
04:51:29,860 --> 04:51:33,619
where I need to go record a reality shifting camera

3707
04:51:33,619 --> 04:51:38,889
to find the tree that falls down.

3708
04:51:38,889 --> 04:51:52,200
Focus on the task we have in front of us.

3709
04:51:52,200 --> 04:51:53,040
Go back to the car.

3710
04:51:53,040 --> 04:52:01,909
You guys want me back at the car now?

3711
04:52:01,909 --> 04:52:03,630
Remember this, people are saying

3712
04:52:03,630 --> 04:52:08,790
that turn left is a railroad from the truck?

3713
04:52:08,790 --> 04:52:11,220
All right, well I'm going back to the truck.

3714
04:52:11,220 --> 04:52:14,689
I'm gonna give this two more attempts

3715
04:52:14,689 --> 04:52:23,759
before I uninstall this game.

3716
04:52:23,759 --> 04:52:25,560
Truck is right here.

3717
04:52:25,560 --> 04:52:30,409
It's not this.

3718
04:52:30,409 --> 04:52:35,319
Drive out of the woods.

3719
04:52:35,319 --> 04:52:36,479
Okay, so here's the truck.

3720
04:52:36,479 --> 04:52:38,560
You saying that there's like a railroad

3721
04:52:38,560 --> 04:52:46,799
around here somewhere?

3722
04:52:46,799 --> 04:52:53,599
Because I went that way and then I went left.

3723
04:52:53,599 --> 04:52:55,000
Walk from the back of the truck to the tree

3724
04:52:55,000 --> 04:52:56,279
and then turn left.

3725
04:52:56,279 --> 04:53:03,659
Didn't I just do that?

3726
04:53:03,659 --> 04:53:16,069
I swear to God, I just did that.

3727
04:53:16,790 --> 04:53:18,509
You need to vent.

3728
04:53:18,509 --> 04:53:19,869
Oh, you're making an Among Us joke.

3729
04:53:19,869 --> 04:53:22,470
I'm like, yeah, I kind of do.

3730
04:53:22,470 --> 04:53:25,750
Okay, turn left.

3731
04:53:25,750 --> 04:53:28,549
Oh yeah, I already went down here, didn't I?

3732
04:53:28,549 --> 04:53:31,509
This is where I just was.

3733
04:53:31,509 --> 04:53:32,830
There's nowhere else to go, right?

3734
04:53:32,830 --> 04:53:33,669
Go left?

3735
04:53:33,669 --> 04:53:37,009
Like down, that guy just was over here.

3736
04:53:37,009 --> 04:54:01,020
There's a path before that.

3737
04:54:01,020 --> 04:54:18,259
Is it this blue shit?

3738
04:54:18,259 --> 04:54:21,479
I can't walk up here, can I?

3739
04:54:21,479 --> 04:54:23,840
Oh my God, I'm walking up this hill.

3740
04:54:23,840 --> 04:54:32,700
Is it this?

3741
04:54:32,700 --> 04:54:36,419
Bros, I think I'm about to fucking flip out.

3742
04:54:36,419 --> 04:54:53,279
Where am I going?

3743
04:54:53,319 --> 04:54:55,439
There's collision in a lot of these places.

3744
04:54:55,439 --> 04:54:56,799
I can't walk over here.

3745
04:54:56,799 --> 04:55:02,419
It's like walled off.

3746
04:55:02,419 --> 04:55:05,110
Path before that?

3747
04:55:05,110 --> 04:55:06,549
That's the only place I can go from there.

3748
04:55:06,549 --> 04:55:08,830
You're saying back of the truck, forward, left path.

3749
04:55:08,830 --> 04:55:13,250
Path potentially before this.

3750
04:55:13,250 --> 04:55:19,560
Do I need neon arrow signs to point me where I need to go?

3751
04:55:19,560 --> 04:55:21,360
I feel like I really should have probably found this

3752
04:55:21,360 --> 04:55:23,340
by now, right?

3753
04:55:23,340 --> 04:55:36,200
Like you all don't even understand where to go either.

3754
04:55:36,200 --> 04:55:40,959
Okay, so like there's only one way I can go, right?

3755
04:55:40,959 --> 04:55:45,139
There's this way and then there's that way.

3756
04:55:45,139 --> 04:55:49,909
So I'm gonna go, I guess that way.

3757
04:55:49,909 --> 04:55:53,029
You should just give up.

3758
04:55:53,029 --> 04:55:58,630
I've been kind of about to.

3759
04:55:58,630 --> 04:56:00,750
Everybody gave shit to like Fable 2

3760
04:56:00,750 --> 04:56:01,909
when they added the breadcrumb trail

3761
04:56:01,909 --> 04:56:03,919
to the bottom of the screen.

3762
04:56:03,919 --> 04:56:06,790
But like, let's be real.

3763
04:56:06,790 --> 04:56:15,220
What the fuck am I even doing right now?

3764
04:56:15,220 --> 04:56:16,740
Like I can't see anything.

3765
04:56:16,740 --> 04:56:24,000
How am I supposed to find anything in this game?

3766
04:56:24,000 --> 04:56:31,340
There's apparently a bridge with a railroad somewhere

3767
04:56:31,340 --> 04:56:37,150
that I was already here.

3768
04:56:37,150 --> 04:56:47,650
Return to the, I gotta read this, I gotta read this.

3769
04:56:47,650 --> 04:56:52,169
Return to the road connecting the tree and the bunker.

3770
04:56:52,169 --> 04:56:53,610
There, play the videotape that you found

3771
04:56:53,610 --> 04:56:56,409
and pause it when the ball lies on the ground.

3772
04:56:56,409 --> 04:56:59,369
This way, I already did that!

3773
04:56:59,369 --> 04:57:00,569
This way it'll appear next to you.

3774
04:57:00,569 --> 04:57:02,689
Pick it up and let your companion sniff it.

3775
04:57:02,689 --> 04:57:04,650
He'll pick up the trail immediately, follow the dog,

3776
04:57:04,650 --> 04:57:07,810
you'll reach an abandoned small gauge train.

3777
04:57:07,810 --> 04:57:09,490
There's a, what?

3778
04:57:09,490 --> 04:57:11,209
He won't sniff the ball anymore.

3779
04:57:11,209 --> 04:57:23,250
I just did that.

3780
04:57:23,250 --> 04:57:25,409
He did.

3781
04:57:25,409 --> 04:57:28,709
Remember he smelled it?

3782
04:57:28,709 --> 04:57:34,169
The game is softlocked now?

3783
04:57:34,169 --> 04:57:36,729
Okay, I'm gonna tell the dog to search if that works,

3784
04:57:36,729 --> 04:57:37,650
I swear.

3785
04:57:37,650 --> 04:57:39,630
Pissed.

3786
04:57:39,630 --> 04:57:42,470
I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be pissed

3787
04:57:42,470 --> 04:57:45,060
if I have to just tell him to go search.

3788
04:57:45,060 --> 04:57:45,900
I'm gonna be pissed.

3789
04:57:45,900 --> 04:57:46,740
Are you ready for me to get really mad?

3790
04:57:46,740 --> 04:57:48,310
Here we go.

3791
04:57:48,310 --> 04:58:23,939
Go back to the truck, okay?

3792
04:58:23,939 --> 04:58:28,360
We're at the truck again.

3793
04:58:28,360 --> 04:58:30,119
What are you finding?

3794
04:58:30,119 --> 04:58:38,659
Find it, go on.

3795
04:58:38,659 --> 04:58:41,680
Okay, we're going over here.

3796
04:58:41,680 --> 04:58:46,700
If he runs me in a circle, I'm refinding the game.

3797
04:58:46,700 --> 04:58:48,180
If we go back to where we just were

3798
04:58:48,180 --> 04:58:49,340
and he like barks and lays down

3799
04:58:49,340 --> 04:58:50,180
and takes his shit on the ground,

3800
04:58:50,180 --> 04:59:11,130
I'm refining the game.

3801
04:59:11,130 --> 04:59:24,000
Where is he?

3802
04:59:24,000 --> 04:59:30,689
I, okay, I was here before.

3803
04:59:30,689 --> 04:59:33,319
This is all the way back.

3804
04:59:33,319 --> 05:00:03,459
This is, remember the little, hey!

3805
05:00:03,459 --> 05:00:05,979
There, there's a stupid thing.

3806
05:00:05,979 --> 05:00:08,520
Okay, I found, oh, there it is.

3807
05:00:08,520 --> 05:00:09,360
There it is.

3808
05:00:09,360 --> 05:00:11,159
The dog just had to go find it.

3809
05:00:11,159 --> 05:00:14,080
I'm walking around like an asshole with six senses

3810
05:00:14,080 --> 05:00:17,080
and I got a super powered animal that has 12.

3811
05:00:17,080 --> 05:00:19,639
I have to use the super powered dog

3812
05:00:19,639 --> 05:00:21,400
that goes and finds everything.

3813
05:00:21,400 --> 05:00:23,840
I didn't, okay, all right, fine.

3814
05:00:23,880 --> 05:00:25,319
So I'm the asshole, okay?

3815
05:00:25,319 --> 05:00:26,159
I'm an asshole.

3816
05:00:26,159 --> 05:00:28,000
I talked a lot of shit about the game.

3817
05:00:28,000 --> 05:00:29,200
Let's be very clear.

3818
05:00:29,200 --> 05:00:33,000
I'm still very upset, but pull out the dumbass webcam

3819
05:00:33,000 --> 05:00:50,680
and let's see what happens to this truck.

3820
05:00:50,680 --> 05:01:03,180
Okay, now what?

3821
05:01:03,180 --> 05:01:04,299
Okay, we can go.

3822
05:01:04,299 --> 05:01:06,770
We can just walk through.

3823
05:01:06,770 --> 05:01:08,650
You don't understand, it's blurry.

3824
05:01:08,650 --> 05:01:10,810
It's blurry, it's dark.

3825
05:01:10,810 --> 05:01:12,970
It's not calibrated correctly.

3826
05:01:17,759 --> 05:01:20,200
Look, you have to do this like, go.

3827
05:01:20,200 --> 05:01:21,040
You find it.

3828
05:01:21,040 --> 05:01:25,139
Look around boy, hell.

3829
05:01:25,139 --> 05:01:25,979
Maybe we can see.

3830
05:01:27,700 --> 05:01:28,900
God damn it.

3831
05:01:28,900 --> 05:01:33,840
We were so close.

3832
05:01:33,840 --> 05:01:34,680
Go ahead.

3833
05:01:34,680 --> 05:01:36,159
I just spent, how long was that?

3834
05:01:36,159 --> 05:01:37,959
Like an hour walking in a circle

3835
05:01:37,959 --> 05:01:39,959
and I have a dog that I didn't even use.

3836
05:01:41,959 --> 05:01:42,799
Fuck.

3837
05:01:42,799 --> 05:01:44,360
I saw it on my way here.

3838
05:01:44,360 --> 05:01:45,560
I could get there in a few minutes.

3839
05:01:45,560 --> 05:01:46,400
God damn it.

3840
05:01:46,400 --> 05:01:49,549
Just stay where you are, okay?

3841
05:01:49,549 --> 05:01:51,830
I'm walking around like smelling the ball,

3842
05:01:51,830 --> 05:01:54,029
like sniffing the trees and shit.

3843
05:01:54,029 --> 05:01:58,040
And he just is, he is the thing that I described.

3844
05:01:58,040 --> 05:02:00,479
He is the Fable II breadcrumb trail.

3845
05:02:00,520 --> 05:02:01,720
I just didn't use it.

3846
05:02:02,599 --> 05:02:03,680
That's my fault.

3847
05:02:03,680 --> 05:02:05,080
I will take that L.

3848
05:02:05,080 --> 05:02:06,439
That's my loss.

3849
05:02:06,439 --> 05:02:08,400
But I'm gonna be very honest with you.

3850
05:02:12,569 --> 05:02:14,009
Just tell me where to go dog.

3851
05:02:14,009 --> 05:02:20,000
Just show me where to go.

3852
05:02:20,000 --> 05:02:22,119
No, I'm not gonna ask where I'm supposed to go now.

3853
05:02:22,119 --> 05:02:23,680
I know exactly where I need to go.

3854
05:02:23,680 --> 05:02:26,240
Follow the dog in the pitch black video game.

3855
05:02:26,240 --> 05:02:28,900
And I sound very upset.

3856
05:02:28,900 --> 05:02:30,139
You know what you can hear when you're like,

3857
05:02:30,139 --> 05:02:34,139
just like really like upset about something?

3858
05:02:34,139 --> 05:02:35,779
I can't believe I walked around.

3859
05:02:35,779 --> 05:02:36,860
Here's the thing.

3860
05:02:36,900 --> 05:02:41,090
Let me tell you, some of you guys,

3861
05:02:41,090 --> 05:02:43,009
where was the backseat Andes saying,

3862
05:02:43,009 --> 05:02:46,180
tell the dog to seek?

3863
05:02:46,180 --> 05:02:47,700
You guys are telling me like,

3864
05:02:47,700 --> 05:02:50,139
oh, go to the back of the truck, turn left,

3865
05:02:50,139 --> 05:02:53,419
take 10 paces forward, stop, look at your watch,

3866
05:02:53,419 --> 05:02:56,419
back up four paces, turn right, look up to the sky.

3867
05:02:57,560 --> 05:03:02,180
No, not one of you said, dude, have the dog help me.

3868
05:03:02,180 --> 05:03:04,180
Not one single person.

3869
05:03:04,180 --> 05:03:06,099
It took an hour and a half.

3870
05:03:06,099 --> 05:03:13,680
I can't believe it took that long.

3871
05:03:13,680 --> 05:03:15,639
Okay, let's all relax.

3872
05:03:16,310 --> 05:03:18,319
Let's chill.

3873
05:03:18,319 --> 05:03:29,299
I'm about to, we're doing progression here.

3874
05:03:29,299 --> 05:03:30,299
Well, the problem is Jeremy,

3875
05:03:30,299 --> 05:03:33,700
you're not facing due Southwest.

3876
05:03:33,700 --> 05:03:34,540
No, this can't happen.

3877
05:03:34,540 --> 05:03:37,259
You've got to, I need you.

3878
05:03:37,259 --> 05:03:40,029
Here, see if you can find something, buddy.

3879
05:03:40,029 --> 05:04:00,189
Go tell me where to go, please.

3880
05:04:00,189 --> 05:04:09,439
Oh man, this has been a wacky day of VR.

3881
05:04:09,439 --> 05:04:10,520
I feel like I've been angry,

3882
05:04:10,520 --> 05:04:15,560
like 35% of the time I've been on this stream right now.

3883
05:04:15,560 --> 05:04:20,919
That's a record.

3884
05:04:20,919 --> 05:04:21,959
You shouldn't have trusted us.

3885
05:04:21,959 --> 05:04:23,560
Well, I was trying to trust you guys

3886
05:04:23,560 --> 05:04:24,799
because you were trying to help.

3887
05:04:24,799 --> 05:04:42,779
You really were.

3888
05:04:42,779 --> 05:04:44,459
I don't have a, what do you mean call?

3889
05:04:44,500 --> 05:04:45,659
I don't have a signal.

3890
05:04:45,659 --> 05:04:46,500
Bullet.

3891
05:04:48,639 --> 05:04:50,819
Ellis to base.

3892
05:04:50,819 --> 05:04:56,409
Landing, where are you?

3893
05:04:56,409 --> 05:04:57,250
So am I.

3894
05:05:05,150 --> 05:05:05,990
That's the one.

3895
05:05:22,759 --> 05:05:24,599
Hey, don't talk to me like I'm crazy.

3896
05:05:32,000 --> 05:05:32,840
Who are you, Emmett?

3897
05:05:32,840 --> 05:05:33,919
I don't need your help.

3898
05:05:33,919 --> 05:05:35,959
No, it's you who needs me.

3899
05:05:35,959 --> 05:05:38,000
Now, I'm the only person in this goddamn forest

3900
05:05:38,000 --> 05:05:40,360
who is even remotely close to finding that kid.

3901
05:05:46,119 --> 05:05:48,369
You there?

3902
05:05:48,369 --> 05:05:49,569
Emmett.

3903
05:05:49,569 --> 05:05:52,569
God damn it.

3904
05:05:52,569 --> 05:05:53,409
What the fuck?

3905
05:05:53,409 --> 05:05:56,909
Hey, who is it?

3906
05:05:56,909 --> 05:05:57,750
Who is it?

3907
05:05:59,509 --> 05:06:00,349
Who is it?

3908
05:06:01,970 --> 05:06:04,490
Who is it?

3909
05:06:04,490 --> 05:06:07,400
Who is it?

3910
05:06:07,400 --> 05:06:08,520
I'll tell you, Ricky.

3911
05:06:08,520 --> 05:06:10,479
I'm gonna be real sure as hell pissed off.

3912
05:06:10,479 --> 05:06:11,400
Ah!

3913
05:06:11,400 --> 05:06:12,220
What is it?

3914
05:06:12,220 --> 05:06:13,060
What happened?

3915
05:06:13,060 --> 05:06:13,900
Who is it?

3916
05:06:13,900 --> 05:06:15,080
What was that?

3917
05:06:15,080 --> 05:06:16,360
Was it the dog just biting?

3918
05:06:16,360 --> 05:06:29,380
What the fuck was that?

3919
05:06:29,380 --> 05:06:31,340
There's no monster.

3920
05:06:31,340 --> 05:06:32,939
It's just like a weird guy

3921
05:06:32,939 --> 05:06:36,540
running around on his fucking hind legs.

3922
05:06:36,540 --> 05:06:37,500
Holy shit.

3923
05:06:49,439 --> 05:06:51,040
Come on, boy.

3924
05:06:51,040 --> 05:06:55,639
Let's go.

3925
05:06:55,639 --> 05:06:56,599
Watch out.

3926
05:06:56,599 --> 05:07:10,959
Watch out for the little gremlin guy.

3927
05:07:10,959 --> 05:07:11,799
Is this a truck?

3928
05:07:11,799 --> 05:07:13,639
Wait, isn't it?

3929
05:07:13,639 --> 05:07:14,799
This is a Jurassic Park truck.

3930
05:07:14,799 --> 05:07:17,520
All right, let's go.

3931
05:07:17,520 --> 05:07:18,799
Open the fucking door.

3932
05:07:21,220 --> 05:07:22,479
What?

3933
05:07:22,479 --> 05:07:23,520
What do you mean it's called landing?

3934
05:07:23,520 --> 05:07:24,360
Nigga!

3935
05:07:24,360 --> 05:07:25,200
What?

3936
05:07:29,200 --> 05:07:30,040
Why is this happening?

3937
05:07:30,040 --> 05:07:31,319
I don't think this should be happening.

3938
05:07:31,319 --> 05:07:33,130
What is happening?

3939
05:07:33,130 --> 05:07:34,529
Get in the truck.

3940
05:07:34,529 --> 05:07:35,369
Get in the truck.

3941
05:07:36,409 --> 05:07:37,970
Bobby, get in the truck.

3942
05:07:37,970 --> 05:07:46,490
Oh my God, what is this thing?

3943
05:07:46,490 --> 05:07:47,909
We gotta go, we gotta go, we gotta go.

3944
05:07:47,909 --> 05:07:49,450
We gotta go, down here.

3945
05:07:50,490 --> 05:07:55,799
Follow me, follow me, come on.

3946
05:07:55,799 --> 05:07:56,639
I'm gonna go in that room.

3947
05:07:56,639 --> 05:08:02,979
I'm gonna close the door.

3948
05:08:02,979 --> 05:08:03,819
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.

3949
05:08:03,819 --> 05:08:14,479
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down.

3950
05:08:14,479 --> 05:08:18,479
Hey!

3951
05:08:18,479 --> 05:08:22,299
Eat shit.

3952
05:08:22,299 --> 05:08:24,319
Wait, my dog.

3953
05:08:24,319 --> 05:08:38,470
What?

3954
05:08:38,470 --> 05:08:47,040
He's not in the room, right?

3955
05:08:47,040 --> 05:08:54,270
Oh shit.

3956
05:08:54,270 --> 05:09:02,240
Is he here?

3957
05:09:02,240 --> 05:09:09,729
I think he's behind this door.

3958
05:09:09,729 --> 05:09:20,849
He's right here.

3959
05:09:20,849 --> 05:09:23,709
Where is he?

3960
05:09:23,709 --> 05:09:33,659
Where is he?

3961
05:09:33,659 --> 05:09:46,049
Hey, hey, hey.

3962
05:09:46,049 --> 05:09:47,009
I don't know, I thought he was doing the thing

3963
05:09:47,009 --> 05:09:48,569
that little kids do when you play hide and seek

3964
05:09:48,569 --> 05:09:54,419
when they hide like right behind the door.

3965
05:09:55,259 --> 05:09:59,060
Don't do that to me, bullet.

3966
05:09:59,060 --> 05:10:11,689
Don't do that to me, bullet.

3967
05:10:11,689 --> 05:10:14,509
The game just got 100,000 times better.

3968
05:10:14,509 --> 05:10:15,990
You tried to take so long to get here.

3969
05:10:15,990 --> 05:10:19,439
This is awesome.

3970
05:10:19,439 --> 05:10:27,080
Oh my God.

3971
05:10:27,080 --> 05:10:34,040
Holy shit in my fucking pants.

3972
05:10:34,040 --> 05:10:39,290
Where's that truck?

3973
05:10:39,290 --> 05:10:40,450
Jesus, man.

3974
05:10:40,450 --> 05:10:42,090
Where's the truck, where's the truck, where's the truck?

3975
05:10:42,090 --> 05:10:44,380
Where's the truck, right here, right?

3976
05:10:44,380 --> 05:10:45,220
So what the hell's going on?

3977
05:10:45,220 --> 05:10:47,700
How do I get out of here?

3978
05:10:47,700 --> 05:10:50,869
How do I get out of here?

3979
05:10:50,869 --> 05:10:52,169
Yeah, okay, there's something here.

3980
05:10:52,169 --> 05:10:54,360
What does it say?

3981
05:10:55,240 --> 05:10:56,680
Chapter three, say the light.

3982
05:10:56,680 --> 05:10:57,520
The light!

3983
05:11:00,119 --> 05:11:05,619
Do I have to shine it on him?

3984
05:11:05,619 --> 05:11:06,580
Use the camera?

3985
05:11:22,340 --> 05:11:24,799
Where is he?

3986
05:11:24,799 --> 05:11:27,000
Okay, all right, okay, just get him on camera.

3987
05:11:27,000 --> 05:11:27,919
Get him on camera.

3988
05:11:29,159 --> 05:11:31,630
Get him on camera.

3989
05:11:31,630 --> 05:11:34,590
Get his ass on camera, get his ass on camera.

3990
05:11:34,590 --> 05:11:42,279
Get him on camera, get him on camera.

3991
05:11:42,279 --> 05:11:45,799
I hit it, where is he?

3992
05:11:45,799 --> 05:11:47,360
What is he calling me, hello?

3993
05:11:47,360 --> 05:11:52,639
The message, but there's no reception.

3994
05:11:52,639 --> 05:12:03,330
Think of getting used to things that make no damn sense.

3995
05:12:03,369 --> 05:12:05,849
Moving is always better than standing.

3996
05:12:05,849 --> 05:12:10,849
Those who don't move have 99% higher chance of dying.

3997
05:12:11,290 --> 05:12:13,840
Better start walking.

3998
05:12:13,840 --> 05:12:24,189
Okay, all right, now let's get to that truck.

3999
05:12:24,189 --> 05:12:27,430
The game now, it just got good, and I'm exhausted now.

4000
05:12:27,430 --> 05:12:28,669
I think I wanna play this again.

4001
05:12:28,669 --> 05:12:30,669
No, but VR, I can't do any more VR.

4002
05:12:30,669 --> 05:12:33,919
Maybe when Among Us comes out.

4003
05:12:33,919 --> 05:12:36,599
I gotta go back to other games.

4004
05:12:36,599 --> 05:12:40,159
I can't just be VR Andy permanently.

4005
05:12:40,159 --> 05:12:49,479
Come here, boy, boy, search.

4006
05:12:49,479 --> 05:12:50,680
All right, put the camera away.

4007
05:12:50,680 --> 05:12:57,860
Let me at least get to the save point.

4008
05:12:57,860 --> 05:12:59,459
Yes, you can.

4009
05:12:59,459 --> 05:13:04,020
No, I really can't though.

4010
05:13:04,020 --> 05:13:06,259
After I do a VR stream,

4011
05:13:06,259 --> 05:13:16,000
for like three days after I do it, I'm like locked up.

4012
05:13:16,000 --> 05:13:19,610
Okay, let's get there.

4013
05:13:19,610 --> 05:13:21,169
More of this game, please.

4014
05:13:21,169 --> 05:13:24,130
Okay, I talked a bunch of shit about this game.

4015
05:13:24,130 --> 05:13:26,150
I was unfair.

4016
05:13:26,150 --> 05:13:27,909
That little weird super fast gremlin guy

4017
05:13:27,909 --> 05:13:34,630
was actually pretty pog, pretty pog.

4018
05:13:34,630 --> 05:13:37,069
I was just walking in circles for like 40.

4019
05:13:37,069 --> 05:13:40,419
Are there more than like 100 people still watching me?

4020
05:13:41,259 --> 05:13:42,099
Considering I walked in a circle

4021
05:13:42,099 --> 05:13:44,450
for like 40 minutes straight.

4022
05:13:44,450 --> 05:13:46,709
Jesus.

4023
05:13:46,709 --> 05:13:47,549
That's it, okay.

4024
05:13:47,549 --> 05:13:58,040
The light.

4025
05:13:58,040 --> 05:13:58,880
Hey, can I get that?

4026
05:13:58,880 --> 05:14:00,720
What is that?

4027
05:14:00,720 --> 05:14:01,560
I can't reach that.

4028
05:14:01,560 --> 05:14:06,229
All right, okay, that's it.

4029
05:14:06,229 --> 05:14:07,959
That's it.

4030
05:14:07,959 --> 05:14:13,549
I'm gonna call it here.

4031
05:14:13,549 --> 05:14:14,750
There's only 10 viewers.

4032
05:14:21,290 --> 05:14:23,369
Yeah, there was 16,000.

4033
05:14:23,369 --> 05:14:26,290
There's I think 4,000 people left

4034
05:14:26,290 --> 05:14:36,310
in the walk around the forest in a circle part.

4035
05:14:36,310 --> 05:14:38,759
All right, so here's what's gonna happen.

4036
05:14:38,759 --> 05:14:41,040
I will see you guys on,

4037
05:14:44,060 --> 05:14:46,689
I'll see you guys on Saturday.

4038
05:14:47,369 --> 05:14:51,439
Saturday, Sunday, this weekend.

4039
05:14:51,439 --> 05:14:55,360
Sunday, Ster and I are gonna play Dying Light 2.

4040
05:14:55,360 --> 05:14:56,840
Saturday, I don't know, maybe we'll just like hang out.

4041
05:14:56,840 --> 05:14:58,799
Maybe I'll do like tier list or something.

4042
05:14:58,799 --> 05:15:02,810
Maybe we'll do some just chatting on Saturday.

4043
05:15:04,299 --> 05:15:11,150
That's fun.

4044
05:15:11,150 --> 05:15:12,790
I had fun.

4045
05:15:12,790 --> 05:15:14,430
Unfortunately, some, you know, whatever.

4046
05:15:14,430 --> 05:15:15,669
I'm not gonna go on a VR ramp,

4047
05:15:15,669 --> 05:15:19,560
but I'll give you a face reveal.

4048
05:15:19,560 --> 05:15:25,590
Hold on one sec.

4049
05:15:25,590 --> 05:15:43,779
How are we?

4050
05:15:43,779 --> 05:15:45,860
All right, I will see you guys.

4051
05:15:45,860 --> 05:15:50,250
Thanks for staying up if you stayed up.

4052
05:15:50,250 --> 05:15:51,930
The streams coming up here on the weekend

4053
05:15:51,930 --> 05:15:52,889
are not gonna be at four.

4054
05:15:52,889 --> 05:15:54,049
They're gonna be at two.

4055
05:15:55,360 --> 05:15:56,360
2 p.m. Pacific.

4056
05:15:56,360 --> 05:16:04,560
We're going back to the 2 p.m. schedule here.

4057
05:16:04,560 --> 05:16:08,849
Thanks for watching everybody.

4058
05:16:08,849 --> 05:16:11,169
Thanks to all the new subs as well.

4059
05:16:11,169 --> 05:16:13,799
And the old ones, as always.

4060
05:16:13,799 --> 05:16:25,209
There were 100 gifted subs, oh my God.

4061
05:16:25,209 --> 05:16:26,970
Yeah, there's some interesting stuff going on,

4062
05:16:26,970 --> 05:16:32,159
especially in like March, April.

4063
05:16:32,159 --> 05:16:35,040
Once we get, when I sit down at my desk on Saturday,

4064
05:16:35,040 --> 05:16:43,599
we'll go over a bunch of cool stuff.

4065
05:16:43,599 --> 05:16:46,830
Baseball's gonna happen probably in March, April.

4066
05:16:46,830 --> 05:16:48,270
And I'm really very interested in the,

4067
05:16:48,310 --> 05:16:52,060
in Cutie Cinderella's streamer awards.

4068
05:16:52,060 --> 05:16:54,439
You guys haven't taken a look at that.

4069
05:16:54,439 --> 05:16:57,599
Probably gonna be a really, really cool event.

4070
05:16:57,599 --> 05:17:05,560
I think that's happening in March too.

4071
05:17:05,560 --> 05:17:09,250
Yeah, Cutie's putting together a show

4072
05:17:09,250 --> 05:17:13,110
to do like a streamer awards thing.

4073
05:17:13,110 --> 05:17:24,630
There's a bunch of categories, like 28 categories I think.

4074
05:17:24,630 --> 05:17:28,159
I voted, I voted.

4075
05:17:28,159 --> 05:17:31,520
Yeah, I'll talk, we'll talk more about it this weekend.

4076
05:17:31,520 --> 05:17:34,680
I think you can nominate up until through the 13th.

4077
05:17:45,319 --> 05:17:46,599
What about the direct tomorrow?

4078
05:17:47,560 --> 05:17:53,360
I'm not doing the direct tomorrow.

4079
05:17:53,360 --> 05:17:59,599
The Nintendo directs are usually only like an hour long.

4080
05:17:59,599 --> 05:18:01,000
100 community subs from,

4081
05:18:01,000 --> 05:18:07,470
I don't see 100 community subs, what are you talking about?

4082
05:18:07,470 --> 05:18:13,259
I don't see 100 community subs.

4083
05:18:13,259 --> 05:18:17,500
I see, I see 10 community subs from fat guy on a bus.

4084
05:18:18,970 --> 05:18:22,970
Oh, IOU, right, that's okay, right, right, right.

4085
05:18:22,970 --> 05:18:25,830
I see, I apologize, I forgot.

4086
05:18:25,830 --> 05:18:28,689
That was like five hours ago.

4087
05:18:28,689 --> 05:18:29,930
Hey, thanks fat guy on a bus.

4088
05:18:29,930 --> 05:18:34,029
I appreciate the 10 subs though.

4089
05:18:34,029 --> 05:18:35,880
All right, I'm gonna do it now.

4090
05:18:35,880 --> 05:18:44,520
I'll do, what was it, 100?

4091
05:18:44,520 --> 05:18:55,959
Hey, should be seeing them any moment now.

4092
05:18:55,959 --> 05:19:01,569
And here it comes, okay.

4093
05:19:12,709 --> 05:19:18,009
Oh shit, I have to put all of my information back in.

4094
05:19:19,369 --> 05:19:20,729
God damn it.

4095
05:19:20,729 --> 05:19:23,970
All right, I need to, I need my like wallet.

4096
05:19:25,490 --> 05:19:29,990
Do they go through when the stream is offline?

4097
05:19:29,990 --> 05:19:33,040
They do, right?

4098
05:19:35,720 --> 05:19:36,680
Yeah, all right, all right.

4099
05:19:36,680 --> 05:19:43,880
Stick around, I need to like get my credit card and stuff.

4100
05:19:43,880 --> 05:19:46,470
I gotta go find my wallet.

4101
05:19:46,470 --> 05:19:47,750
I'm not, no, I swear to God,

4102
05:19:47,750 --> 05:19:53,159
it'll be there within five minutes.

4103
05:19:53,159 --> 05:19:55,680
Because I like redid some stuff on Twitch.

4104
05:19:55,680 --> 05:19:59,990
I have to like put all my info back in.

4105
05:19:59,990 --> 05:20:04,520
I used to be saved, but not anymore.

4106
05:20:04,520 --> 05:20:06,240
Just run ads right now.

4107
05:20:11,880 --> 05:20:15,040
Ad break time, but that's so, okay.

4108
05:20:15,040 --> 05:20:18,080
You wanna run ads, fine, let's run a few ads.

4109
05:20:18,080 --> 05:20:22,979
Give me a minute, let me close out of a few things.

4110
05:20:23,060 --> 05:20:26,880
All right, stick around, I'll be right back.

4111
05:20:26,880 --> 05:20:37,360
Give me a minute, hold on.

4112
05:20:37,360 --> 05:20:45,540
One sec.

4113
05:22:03,919 --> 05:22:04,759
Did it go through?

4114
05:22:08,040 --> 05:22:08,959
Did it go through?

4115
05:22:11,270 --> 05:22:26,159
Go through, what?

4116
05:22:26,159 --> 05:22:27,159
Did that go through?

4117
05:22:31,500 --> 05:22:33,939
My payment couldn't go through?

4118
05:22:33,939 --> 05:22:35,020
Wait, what?

4119
05:22:36,950 --> 05:22:39,110
Hold on, wait, what the fuck?

4120
05:22:40,659 --> 05:22:42,659
Oh God, give me a second.

4121
05:22:43,500 --> 05:22:45,380
What the fuck, hold on.

4122
05:22:46,680 --> 05:22:49,220
Did I put my card in wrong?

4123
05:22:49,220 --> 05:24:06,400
One sec, dude, I can't do this.

4124
05:24:06,400 --> 05:24:11,080
I keep getting, unexpected error has occurred.

4125
05:24:11,080 --> 05:24:13,759
What?

4126
05:24:13,759 --> 05:24:16,200
Literally scammed, yeah, I can't do it.

4127
05:24:16,200 --> 05:24:20,040
I don't know why it won't go through.

4128
05:24:20,040 --> 05:24:21,000
He's broke?

4129
05:24:25,409 --> 05:24:27,549
That's weird.

4130
05:24:27,549 --> 05:24:30,110
I don't know why my card's getting declined.

4131
05:24:33,450 --> 05:24:37,090
Okay, so I gotta kind of figure out why that's happening.

4132
05:24:42,919 --> 05:24:47,500
Let me try something else, one sec.

4133
05:24:47,580 --> 05:24:49,740
I'm gonna try one more time with,

4134
05:24:49,740 --> 05:24:51,979
let me try something else, I'll be right back.

4135
05:25:53,909 --> 05:25:54,950
Dude, that didn't work either.

4136
05:25:54,950 --> 05:25:59,630
I don't, I think, is there something wrong with Twitch?

4137
05:25:59,630 --> 05:26:01,869
Cause I can't, I tried two, three different payment methods

4138
05:26:01,869 --> 05:26:03,549
now, I think something's wrong.

4139
05:26:08,220 --> 05:26:09,060
I have no idea.

4140
05:26:11,680 --> 05:26:13,520
We're gonna have to save this and hold on to this, I think,

4141
05:26:13,520 --> 05:26:15,319
cause I've tried all the payment methods,

4142
05:26:15,319 --> 05:26:16,639
I don't know what's going on.

4143
05:26:20,610 --> 05:26:22,250
How convenient.

4144
05:26:22,250 --> 05:26:24,970
I've never backed away from a sub, a gift sub,

4145
05:26:24,970 --> 05:26:33,590
you all know that.

4146
05:26:34,110 --> 05:26:38,430
No, but I mean previously, in previous time.

4147
05:26:38,430 --> 05:26:40,669
Hold on to it, next stream, I will do it.

4148
05:26:40,669 --> 05:26:42,669
I gotta figure out why all my payment methods

4149
05:26:42,669 --> 05:26:44,509
are getting just dropped.

4150
05:26:44,509 --> 05:26:46,590
Purchase could not be completed.

4151
05:26:46,590 --> 05:26:47,750
I don't understand why.

4152
05:26:50,330 --> 05:26:52,090
I don't have like a text or anything from like a bank.

4153
05:26:52,090 --> 05:26:56,409
No, nothing, this won't go through.

4154
05:26:56,409 --> 05:27:00,020
But we're gonna have to do it next stream.

4155
05:27:00,020 --> 05:27:02,840
I gotta figure this out.

4156
05:27:02,840 --> 05:27:05,680
Sorry, that was supposed to happen, I just tried.

4157
05:27:06,869 --> 05:27:08,549
On Saturday, please remind me.

4158
05:27:12,490 --> 05:27:15,869
And we'll see you again.

4159
05:27:16,709 --> 05:27:17,549
Take care, everybody.

4160
05:27:17,549 --> 05:27:22,419
Have a great rest of your evening.

4161
05:27:22,419 --> 05:27:25,720
And see you guys soon.

4162
05:27:32,000 --> 05:27:33,240
Now, cause I gotta figure out if that's happening

4163
05:27:33,240 --> 05:27:36,119
on other services, I gotta figure that out.

4164
05:27:36,119 --> 05:27:40,130
Turn off my VPN, my VPN's not on.

4165
05:27:40,130 --> 05:27:42,130
I have turned it off before I tried to do it,

4166
05:27:42,130 --> 05:27:44,040
so don't worry.

4167
05:27:44,040 --> 05:27:45,840
Remind me on Saturday, I'll see you guys soon.

4168
05:27:45,840 --> 05:27:46,680
Take care of yourselves.

4169
05:27:46,680 --> 05:27:48,939
Thanks for watching, as always.

4170
05:27:48,939 --> 05:27:50,580
And I'll see you again.

4171
05:27:50,580 --> 05:27:51,419
Goodnight, guys.
