00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:07,849
American Family Insurance gives you, I don't know, I have no idea how their coverage is, but I'm not gonna read that.

2
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:18,550
Odd Watchers skip 30 minutes. Why? Because I, every time we start a VR stream,

3
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:22,910
I cherish the fact that I'm not stuck in a virtual world for 20 minutes.

4
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:28,510
I can exist out in my own space and hang out and see what you guys are really saying in real time.

5
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:39,020
It's not 30 minutes, it's like 10, but you did that all day.

6
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,859
Hey, you don't know what I did all day.

7
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:50,320
For all you know, I could have been sitting on the toilet for an hour. How do you know?

8
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:05,569
Did my, did my make Jerma, what? Did my make Jerma, what?

9
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:13,219
He's still on the toilet. I wish I could get away with that. There's no way I could though, you know it.

10
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,379
There's no way I could do a

11
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:21,700
accidental face cam, the whole computer's in the bathroom, and I'm sitting on the toilet.

12
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,670
I mean, I guess I could, but not the way that I want.

13
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:46,489
Just like old times, yeah. We need the bird's-eye view. Wait, the bird's-eye view in the bathroom?

14
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:50,319
Why would I have all that?

15
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:57,909
Why would I go through the pain and suffering to set up like five cameras to do a look at me

16
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:08,580
I'm on the toilet joke. Make it the next event. No, that's not the next event.

17
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:11,889
Can I just drink my coffee for a second?

18
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:18,159
Can't wait till he does that. Chat, I'm not gonna cut off a finger. Not one. I'm, alright, I'll do one.

19
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,080
I hate that fucking coffee pasta, but I'd love it at the same time.

20
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:34,479
Just one finger. No, I'm not gonna do it. I'm not going, alright, two? Two sounds good.

21
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,270
I hate it.

22
00:02:39,669 --> 00:02:46,680
Look, Chubby Bunny is not gonna happen before a VR stream or during a VR stream.

23
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,680
You know how horrible that would be?

24
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,159
Hey guys, I just got out of VR. I feel like shit. It's been like four hours.

25
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:57,000
Let me stuff my mouth full of marshmallows until I throw up.

26
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,439
No, that's gonna be, that's gonna happen on like a gaming stream.

27
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:17,360
Okay, S. This is a gaming stream. I mean it is, but it's me being put inside of the video game.

28
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:21,969
Thought I cleared my throat with much more than this before I unmuted.

29
00:03:22,789 --> 00:03:24,150
Apparently not.

30
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:35,639
Okay, see? I'm not old. I'm just like you. I'm in my early 20s. I'm young.

31
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:41,490
Real voice.

32
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,400
Just like me.

33
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,400
Oh, he just drank blood.

34
00:03:50,439 --> 00:04:00,270
What is this? Is this an iteration? Look chat, no, there's no way I'm not gonna cut my dick off.

35
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:08,439
Holy shit, dude. Alright, that one's fucked up. That one's wicked fucked up. That's, that's like a not okay one.

36
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:13,800
That's, that one's not okay. That one's not one we can paste as like a funny copy paste up.

37
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:31,839
Yay for Jerma. And paste a pasta, paste a post a post. What do you want me to say? Good hair?

38
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:39,050
It's, it is okay. This part I'm not happy about. If I just go like that, it's fine.

39
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:52,839
Amazing hair. Where did you get that shirt? Uh, from, yeah from Jackbox Party Pack.

40
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,500
This is not official merch. Uh, I like, I missed out on that one big time, I think.

41
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:02,290
We gave like Jackbox like fucking 12 grand.

42
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,959
Whoops.

43
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:19,459
Look at this, dude. Where can I get that shirt? If there's like, uh, look, I'll, uh, alright.

44
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:27,000
Long time ago, I was gonna make a fireman t-shirt, but I, you know me with merchandise. I suck.

45
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,800
I like just, I don't even, I just don't care. You know, I do like one shirt every three years.

46
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:39,519
I know, I know everybody like wants it, but like I just, it's, it's, it's too much for me to do and that's stupid.

47
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:42,470
I know.

48
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:49,750
We want it. I know, I know, but like I'm just such a loser. I like, I can't, I don't do merch.

49
00:05:50,269 --> 00:06:00,329
That means when, when a merch does come out though, it's rare as fuck. Make an official one, maybe.

50
00:06:00,769 --> 00:06:11,220
You know, here's the thing, you know, glue man, the glue man shirt originally, here's some, some lore for you guys.

51
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:18,240
Originally the glue man shirt was never going to be made ever again, and I think only like, I think like

52
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,720
1,400 glue man shirts existed. That was it.

53
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:29,560
So for like five years straight, you, if you owned a glue man shirt, you were one of only like 1,400 orders.

54
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:34,329
That was pretty limited and then I, obviously that didn't last very long.

55
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,120
Now you can get any, you can get any, I got, I got a t-shirt store on Teespring.

56
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:44,560
One of two shirts you can buy right now.

57
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:48,720
This is not one of them.

58
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:54,100
This is not one of the official shirts.

59
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,970
Now we got glue man, we got the night sky,

60
00:06:59,829 --> 00:07:03,470
and coming soon, we've got the three singing rats for Christmas.

61
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:08,149
They're going to be, their heads are going to be up like, singing, one, two, three.

62
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:13,970
They're both going to have Christmas hats on, all three of them.

63
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:20,029
Heads up, singing, and you can see like the bottom, like the little part of their mouth right here, like one, two, three.

64
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:26,480
Fuck, I have to do that now.

65
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:35,529
What time is it?

66
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:38,459
Not November, right?

67
00:07:39,339 --> 00:07:39,980
It's October.

68
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:43,910
Okay. Let me, let me look into that.

69
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:44,629
Ahem.

70
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,060
That was a monk of ets.

71
00:07:48,459 --> 00:07:50,019
Let me look into that, monk of ets.

72
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,089
Fucking play already.

73
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:58,319
I get to, he just made me kick my fucking VR headset right in the glass part too.

74
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,680
Man that person.

75
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,550
I just kicked the glass part, my heel went ding.

76
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:10,110
I'm just trying, look, I'm going, I, we only got like another three hours in the game anyways.

77
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,800
That's not on me.

78
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,000
This is, why is this a Reddit mug?

79
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,639
Because it says the name J on it?

80
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,860
Which is the first, the letter of my first name?

81
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,590
That's not an egomaniac.

82
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:35,269
Oh yeah.

83
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:35,669
Okay.

84
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:36,590
I'm an egomaniac.

85
00:08:36,629 --> 00:08:39,750
What, what if this said number one best dad in the world?

86
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,909
You don't think that's an egomaniac?

87
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,279
Number one best dad in the world.

88
00:08:47,539 --> 00:08:48,460
That doesn't say that.

89
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:52,139
This doesn't say number one best Jeremy on earth.

90
00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:55,379
I don't drink out of egomaniac mugs like that.

91
00:08:55,379 --> 00:08:56,580
I just want you to know who I am.

92
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:02,639
This doesn't, this doesn't say Jer, this is the best Jeremy currently drinking this.

93
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,320
And why am I stalling?

94
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,559
I'll tell you, because I don't want this to have any liquid in it before I start to get in the

95
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:15,440
headset, because this has coffee.

96
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:21,740
Is it, look, look, I don't want to spill this, but look, am I going to dump this on the

97
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,580
fucking go XLR?

98
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,259
I almost just did.

99
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:25,350
Look, can you see?

100
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,500
Here, here, have a sip.

101
00:09:31,389 --> 00:09:35,129
See, it looks, it looks like a fucking slush.

102
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,169
That's ice.

103
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:37,730
It's ice coffee.

104
00:09:37,769 --> 00:09:38,250
Okay.

105
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:40,679
I don't want that to spill.

106
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:44,279
I'm going to hit the keyboard and this thing's going to fly in the air and dump all over

107
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:44,799
the ground.

108
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,519
It's ice.

109
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:47,559
It's loaded with ice.

110
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:49,700
What about my wrist?

111
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:57,490
How do I feel like I'm a VR character holding this in VR?

112
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:01,240
Why does it, why does it look like that?

113
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:08,250
Okay.

114
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:08,850
That was weird.

115
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:14,399
Why, why do I feel like I can't hold this now?

116
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,200
Why is it like, why is it weird to hold this now?

117
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,480
Like that?

118
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:18,720
Okay.

119
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,159
That's better.

120
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:19,919
All right.

121
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:20,639
Let me just finish this.

122
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:28,480
There's a lot in here.

123
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,799
I don't like drinking in front of people.

124
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:32,519
You know that?

125
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:33,840
You notice that?

126
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:37,200
I hate drinking liquids in front of you guys.

127
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:40,940
I don't know something about it.

128
00:10:41,419 --> 00:10:41,940
I don't like it.

129
00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:43,740
I don't like people watching me eat either.

130
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:48,360
Bod watch or skip.

131
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,320
You said 30 minutes.

132
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:49,919
That was a lie.

133
00:10:52,549 --> 00:10:53,509
Stop stalling and drink.

134
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:54,389
It's coffee.

135
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,230
I don't want to just chug coffee.

136
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,909
You've seen me what I look like when I don't have coffee.

137
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,450
You want me to drink this as fast as I can?

138
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:03,769
I'll be like, I'll be bouncing off of walls.

139
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,409
It's cold too.

140
00:11:09,409 --> 00:11:10,129
It's too cold.

141
00:11:12,289 --> 00:11:13,490
Man discovers coffee.

142
00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:16,590
I drink coffee like every day, bro.

143
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,470
I almost just like burp puked into the microphone.

144
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:21,519
Okay.

145
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,159
I have a question.

146
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:22,960
I have a question.

147
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,200
How many, how many upvotes on like fuck face Reddit, right?

148
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,559
On like, this guy sucks.

149
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,480
Like, on like, holy shit.

150
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,120
Freak out.

151
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,919
Like what, what do I, I don't even like the weird fucking freak out Reddits.

152
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:34,159
Right?

153
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:39,879
Like if you saw them, if the microphone was right here and I went like, oh yeah, bro.

154
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:43,240
And I like burp puked all over it and went like, oh fuck.

155
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:45,679
Like what, does that have a thousand upvotes?

156
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:47,039
2000 upvotes.

157
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:47,759
How many upvotes?

158
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:53,600
It would be on live stream fields.

159
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,960
Oh, well, whatever.

160
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:01,820
No, it would not have a hundred thousand upvotes.

161
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:10,029
Donald Trump could stand on stage and just piss his pants.

162
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,710
Just pee.

163
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,870
And you see the pee forming and going down the leg.

164
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:20,409
Just going, and that would not get, that would get like 80,000 upvotes.

165
00:12:20,409 --> 00:12:27,159
That would not get a hundred thousand upvotes.

166
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:33,690
Oh, it would probably get like 20,000.

167
00:12:34,409 --> 00:12:38,440
Are you doing political satire?

168
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:38,600
What?

169
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,759
Has it said the president pees his pants on stage?

170
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,080
80,000 upvotes.

171
00:12:49,789 --> 00:12:51,149
Oh, he's getting political.

172
00:12:53,129 --> 00:12:55,850
Hey, hey, wouldn't it be funny if Donald Trump peed his pants?

173
00:12:56,649 --> 00:12:57,289
What's that mean?

174
00:12:57,929 --> 00:12:58,250
What?

175
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,049
Why'd he say that?

176
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:01,049
I wonder.

177
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:04,090
He might be a Democrat.

178
00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:06,320
No, no, no, no.

179
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,799
He might be one of those Republicans.

180
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:11,080
He must be.

181
00:13:19,659 --> 00:13:20,860
Politics Andy.

182
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:25,179
Omega O.R.

183
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:28,490
Dude, you're freaking me out.

184
00:13:29,129 --> 00:13:30,940
That's VR streams.

185
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:35,019
I let loose on VR streams because I get to stand up and move around.

186
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:40,039
You guys understand that when I'm sitting here like this

187
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:43,720
and I have to sit here with a mouse in my hand, I cannot, I cannot unleash.

188
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,539
See, I have to go like this.

189
00:13:47,179 --> 00:13:48,299
Okay, let me move my mouse.

190
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:54,110
No, I don't get to fucking like unleash.

191
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:54,750
All right, let's go.

192
00:13:55,389 --> 00:14:08,750
Okay, there's just ice in there now.

193
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,029
If I knock it over, I don't care.

194
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:13,480
Time for Half-Life Alex.

195
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:21,799
He's unhinged.

196
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,679
I can't stall 15 minutes for me to get ready.

197
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:27,200
We only have like another two hours in the game.

198
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:27,519
Anyway.

199
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:43,019
Okay, so we last we did, we did Jeff, which was ridiculous.

200
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:49,100
That was probably top 10, like worst things ever in VR and not in a bad way.

201
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:51,690
In like a holy shit.

202
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,049
I hate this every second of this.

203
00:14:53,049 --> 00:14:54,090
It's real life.

204
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:54,889
I don't like the glass.

205
00:14:54,889 --> 00:14:57,049
The glass shattering makes me, gives me nausea.

206
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:59,080
It was insane.

207
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:04,320
You know when you want to look up stuff about a game, but you're not done with it yet.

208
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,720
I really want to look up like, oh, what was the scariest chapter in Half-Life Alex?

209
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:12,360
And why?

210
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,279
I can't do that yet.

211
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:17,929
I can't look up like, oh, wait, what are the secrets of Jeff?

212
00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:19,600
Nope.

213
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,080
I want to.

214
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:31,080
Oh, then put the headset on.

215
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,360
Just hold on a second.

216
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,840
Okay, that's right here.

217
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,720
Look, you're going to give, I'm going to unmute the game.

218
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,320
It's been 15 minutes.

219
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,440
It's been like two hours.

220
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:01,840
Okay, ladies and gentlemen, head to the end.

221
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:13,929
I think Alex, it's comfy, a little tight, a little tight.

222
00:16:13,929 --> 00:16:14,970
It's pissing me off.

223
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:22,909
I hope it's do this.

224
00:16:22,909 --> 00:16:23,230
Why?

225
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:28,110
Okay, here's a pro tip for anybody developing a virtual reality headset.

226
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,669
Make these different colors.

227
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:34,909
Like, oh, left is yellow and right is green.

228
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:37,549
Okay, I see green, right?

229
00:16:37,549 --> 00:16:42,830
Not like the tiny, teeny little R that's etched on the grain of rice down here.

230
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,580
That's L.

231
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:58,799
Hey, finally, finally, finally, finally, finally.

232
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:02,779
All right, this is chapter eight.

233
00:17:02,779 --> 00:17:06,750
It's called Key Activity.

234
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,640
Welcome, everybody, to the stream.

235
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,250
Hey, strap in.

236
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:17,900
You've got to, you notice how my voice is different

237
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,579
because the headset's like pushing on my nose.

238
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,960
So if I sound different, that's like why.

239
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,640
People say, why does it sound so weird?

240
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,599
Because I have a huge fucking nose and this is just crushing it.

241
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:35,069
Okay, this is where we left off.

242
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,140
This is still broken, by the way.

243
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,579
So going left is almost impossible.

244
00:17:41,579 --> 00:17:43,339
Thank God it's not used for anything else

245
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,099
because I have to fucking crush it and it doesn't work half the time.

246
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,140
Let's go.

247
00:17:49,019 --> 00:17:55,680
Where was I going?

248
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:10,250
Kalanja of captivity.

249
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:15,960
Fuck.

250
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:20,809
What was that?

251
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:21,849
Oh, resume.

252
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:29,710
Everybody, okay, when you play a lot of VR, anybody else get like this?

253
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:40,380
Where, even in your real life, shit feels like weird being alive in real life.

254
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:41,740
I do.

255
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:48,359
This is why you can't be in here for that long.

256
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:56,759
Like, when I was pouring my coffee this morning, it was like,

257
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,779
and then like the trash came and like flew at my face.

258
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:10,970
It doesn't look right.

259
00:19:25,369 --> 00:19:26,890
Do not tell anybody to skip.

260
00:19:27,849 --> 00:19:28,329
Not yet.

261
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:37,869
Is there a third one?

262
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:51,339
Heck, yep.

263
00:19:51,339 --> 00:20:01,210
All right, what do I got?

264
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:02,410
25 resin, that's yes.

265
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,279
What do you, what should I do?

266
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,980
Shotgun?

267
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:14,059
Oh, double shot.

268
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,740
That sounds kind of good.

269
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:20,059
Adds the option to fire a second shot immediately after the first.

270
00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:21,099
So like, ba-boom.

271
00:20:22,059 --> 00:20:26,519
Fucks.

272
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:27,640
Renade launcher?

273
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,269
Holy shit.

274
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:37,259
It's, don't, don't, don't.

275
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:38,700
All right, I won't.

276
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,849
Otto?

277
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,599
Was there a dog out there?

278
00:20:48,569 --> 00:20:49,769
Okay, okay, Otto.

279
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:56,640
Otto, you want to come in?

280
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:07,880
Lie down on this blanket over here.

281
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,309
What do you want?

282
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,789
He's lying down in front of the door, just wagging his tail like,

283
00:21:15,869 --> 00:21:17,309
yeah, I just want you to open the door.

284
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:17,789
I don't care.

285
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:20,269
Come on, let's go in here.

286
00:21:20,269 --> 00:21:21,710
You want to come in here and lie down over here?

287
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:24,809
What are you doing?

288
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:28,809
Well, I'm just going to leave the door open because,

289
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,339
what's, why, what are you doing?

290
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:36,029
All right.

291
00:21:36,589 --> 00:21:40,589
Oh, he's just sleeping out there.

292
00:21:41,309 --> 00:21:42,269
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

293
00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:42,829
What am I doing?

294
00:21:43,549 --> 00:21:49,549
Okay.

295
00:21:49,549 --> 00:21:51,599
I don't know where, where was I?

296
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:52,000
This way.

297
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:53,519
I'm going to save the resin.

298
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,549
That's dangerous.

299
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,740
Um, he usually just kind of sits in the same spot.

300
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,380
So, and like, here's the thing.

301
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,980
I'm kind of like, I'm like a bug.

302
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:09,339
Like, I can feel the vibrations in the ground.

303
00:22:10,299 --> 00:22:11,339
Like, on my feet.

304
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:15,660
If he, if that door opens, I will feel it.

305
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,619
It's like a spider web.

306
00:22:16,619 --> 00:22:19,180
Like, I can feel it in my, on like the bottoms of my feet.

307
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:26,319
All right, we need a power source.

308
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:33,470
All right, power.

309
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:39,259
Cool.

310
00:22:40,269 --> 00:22:42,750
Looks like you're going to have to go all the way to the antlion cave.

311
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:46,170
Or not.

312
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:47,930
It's literally right here.

313
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,099
Need any, any resin?

314
00:22:57,529 --> 00:22:58,490
That was easy.

315
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:01,740
Derma, get the gun.

316
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,859
Derma, gun, gun.

317
00:23:02,859 --> 00:23:04,059
Don't tell him.

318
00:23:04,059 --> 00:23:04,380
Don't tell him.

319
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,259
What do you mean get the gun?

320
00:23:09,529 --> 00:23:10,029
Gun.

321
00:23:10,809 --> 00:23:14,670
There is no gun.

322
00:23:17,309 --> 00:23:18,880
Power.

323
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,920
Unlimited power.

324
00:23:23,529 --> 00:23:24,569
Total corruption.

325
00:23:25,289 --> 00:23:26,250
Total power.

326
00:23:27,549 --> 00:23:28,670
Yeah, I play hearts, Dylan.

327
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:29,309
Whatever, man.

328
00:23:29,309 --> 00:23:41,369
That's an antlion, Russell.

329
00:23:42,009 --> 00:23:43,369
That's an antlion?

330
00:23:43,369 --> 00:23:43,869
Yes.

331
00:23:44,329 --> 00:23:45,049
Oh, shit.

332
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:46,650
I do know what antlions are.

333
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:48,009
Yes, they're leggy.

334
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,690
God, the fucking.

335
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:51,130
Wow, that would have been a disaster.

336
00:23:51,849 --> 00:23:52,650
Is it a grenade?

337
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:53,930
No, it's a rotten apple.

338
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:54,490
Same thing.

339
00:23:55,369 --> 00:24:02,720
All right, if I were to leave this, would I ever be able to get it back?

340
00:24:12,349 --> 00:24:12,910
And in there.

341
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:15,849
Okay.

342
00:24:15,849 --> 00:24:16,569
Antlions.

343
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,009
Oh, wait.

344
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:19,529
Oh, wait.

345
00:24:20,329 --> 00:24:22,359
Oh, click.

346
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:27,390
Egg.

347
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:31,690
Well, there is, there are antlions in the game.

348
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:32,809
I hate antlions.

349
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:33,690
They're terrifying.

350
00:24:34,329 --> 00:24:36,890
Hold on, I'm going to make this little smile off my tiny head.

351
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:43,740
I got my flashlight's gone.

352
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,619
I don't like that.

353
00:24:45,259 --> 00:24:50,089
I'm afraid of bugs.

354
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:02,859
Oh, no, I thought Jeff was supposed to be the scary chapter, not the antlion chapter.

355
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:08,839
Who isn't afraid of bugs?

356
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:12,839
I feel like that's just a universal thing everybody agrees on.

357
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:17,359
Fuck are you?

358
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,640
I don't know where he is.

359
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,079
I don't know where he is.

360
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:20,960
He's up there somewhere.

361
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:24,319
Where is he?

362
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:24,799
What is it?

363
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:27,000
In the fireplace?

364
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:38,890
He's like, he's over here.

365
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:39,849
I need to pick a gun than this.

366
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:48,910
Fuck.

367
00:25:49,289 --> 00:25:54,000
Are you Rex?

368
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:56,650
Are you Sorus?

369
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:57,369
Something like that.

370
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:03,200
Uh, I need to store this.

371
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,480
Oh, I still have a bottle.

372
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,319
Okay, um, let's get rid of that.

373
00:26:10,089 --> 00:26:12,250
Jeff fucking sprints down this hallway.

374
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:15,400
Okay, I think we're good.

375
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:22,029
Gotta be ready.

376
00:26:22,029 --> 00:26:24,779
I'm going to examine over here because there's probably shit over here.

377
00:26:25,579 --> 00:26:28,299
This motherfucker is going to sh-

378
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,720
He's going to be in the fireplace.

379
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,279
I know it.

380
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:44,349
Here?

381
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:51,559
Oh, gross.

382
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:53,839
Oh my god.

383
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,880
What is that?

384
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,079
That's a different-

385
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:05,450
What the fuck is going on?

386
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:14,119
All right, good.

387
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:15,720
That guy was going to jump scare me in the other room.

388
00:27:21,789 --> 00:27:22,349
All right, is this-

389
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:22,849
Is this-

390
00:27:25,609 --> 00:27:28,750
How does this go in?

391
00:27:35,339 --> 00:27:37,599
Oh, free.

392
00:27:44,809 --> 00:27:45,210
Cool.

393
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:46,170
All right, that's how that works.

394
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:51,950
Oh, well, that's good.

395
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,069
I got 90 shots in there.

396
00:27:53,069 --> 00:27:54,109
It's ready to rock and roll.

397
00:27:57,599 --> 00:27:58,400
Don't move.

398
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:02,029
I'm a slug.

399
00:28:02,029 --> 00:28:02,750
Hey, Jerma, I've been-

400
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:03,309
I missed it.

401
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:05,470
Throw the vodka.

402
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,440
I did throw the vodka.

403
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,720
This is a pretty cool exhibit.

404
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,390
This is supposed to be like Jurassic-

405
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:14,269
This is Jurassic Park.

406
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:16,430
This is Jurassic Park was in Half-Life.

407
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:16,930
Yeah.

408
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:18,430
I don't touch the glass.

409
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:18,930
See?

410
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:21,119
They ran around here and shit.

411
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:21,619
And they-

412
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,920
There was like a speaker that talked about them.

413
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,559
That was right here.

414
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:28,559
I think it's-

415
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:40,910
I need ammo, which is a good thing.

416
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,349
I want to go over there.

417
00:28:42,349 --> 00:28:44,829
But watch out for that antlion nest.

418
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:48,750
Okay.

419
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:49,549
Okay.

420
00:28:49,549 --> 00:28:51,390
Come over here then and say it to me.

421
00:28:52,349 --> 00:28:54,009
I forget-

422
00:28:54,009 --> 00:28:55,690
I don't know anything about antlions from Half-Life 2.

423
00:28:56,329 --> 00:28:58,960
What are you-

424
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,519
Where do you shoot?

425
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,200
This sh-

426
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:05,730
Oh!

427
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:08,430
Okay.

428
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:10,190
You're gonna shoot their legs and then shoot them in the head.

429
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:27,630
Yep.

430
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:55,630
I was trying to be cool and it made it-

431
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:56,670
I was trying to not be scared.

432
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:03,869
Oh.

433
00:30:04,009 --> 00:30:17,940
Shit!

434
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:21,420
All right, we're gonna drive-

435
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:21,920
Is it-

436
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:28,210
Oh.

437
00:30:29,819 --> 00:30:40,170
Oh, this increased, dude.

438
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:40,670
Thanks, man.

439
00:30:41,289 --> 00:30:49,359
Load this shit up.

440
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:50,319
We got fully loaded.

441
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,759
Fully loaded.

442
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:52,259
Let's go.

443
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,359
Is there any, uh, drink it?

444
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:02,109
Here.

445
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:06,029
Okay, so I'm assuming that the next thing I do

446
00:31:06,029 --> 00:31:07,630
is gonna be one of the last upgrades of the game.

447
00:31:08,509 --> 00:31:11,789
Should I get the grenade launcher or should I get, like,

448
00:31:11,789 --> 00:31:13,390
super upgrade the pistol or something?

449
00:31:14,029 --> 00:31:15,089
What do you think?

450
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:19,359
Grenade launcher.

451
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,920
Grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade launcher.

452
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,640
Max the pistol.

453
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,440
Max out the pistol.

454
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,039
Uh, that depends.

455
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:27,900
Oh, we got on-

456
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:28,400
Okay.

457
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:40,690
That's-

458
00:31:40,829 --> 00:31:42,829
Is that where, like, I got that noise from?

459
00:31:45,309 --> 00:31:46,910
I think that is the noise.

460
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:52,589
Yeah, it is.

461
00:31:52,589 --> 00:31:53,869
That's some deep lore that I-

462
00:31:53,869 --> 00:31:54,750
I didn't even know about.

463
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:57,710
Is that healing sound from Half-Life?

464
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:58,430
Is that sound?

465
00:32:02,809 --> 00:32:08,430
This place is-

466
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:08,930
Whoa!

467
00:32:09,789 --> 00:32:22,519
What the fuck?

468
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:23,480
Yeah, that-

469
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:30,859
Oh, shit.

470
00:32:30,859 --> 00:32:31,579
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!

471
00:32:31,579 --> 00:32:32,460
It's an exhibit in there.

472
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:32,859
Hold on.

473
00:32:32,859 --> 00:32:33,740
I'll deal with you later.

474
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:38,170
This exhibit is currently closed for root-

475
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:39,130
It's gonna break through the glass!

476
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:44,779
I knew that was gonna happen.

477
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:48,460
The second that they give you this to look down at-

478
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,579
Oh, glass.

479
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,019
What's that?

480
00:32:51,819 --> 00:32:52,319
Smash!

481
00:32:54,299 --> 00:32:55,259
Of course, I knew that.

482
00:32:55,259 --> 00:32:56,700
Right when they showed me that shit, I knew it.

483
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,359
Yeah, that's what that's for.

484
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,599
Uh, this place is awesome.

485
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:26,240
All right, this just reminds me of just, like, every single, um-

486
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:32,480
Every single, like, lizard or snake or tarantula exhibit you go look at, you go-

487
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,920
Oh, cool!

488
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,640
What's it say there?

489
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,519
Oh, giant fucking poisonous evil lizard!

490
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:38,640
Oh, I can't wait to see him!

491
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:44,599
Where is he?

492
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,720
Oh, oh, he's under that rock over there, sleeping.

493
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,640
And they sleep for 17 hours a day.

494
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,420
Oh.

495
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:56,299
Okay.

496
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,160
Cool that you have this here.

497
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:04,839
I think- Is this live?

498
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:09,380
Wait.

499
00:34:12,989 --> 00:34:13,789
Why do you sleep?

500
00:34:13,789 --> 00:34:14,590
Let me watch you.

501
00:34:15,309 --> 00:34:20,110
And guess what, guys?

502
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:21,389
I felt my-

503
00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:22,590
I felt my spider web.

504
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:26,139
Hiding down right there.

505
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:39,019
Close your eye.

506
00:34:39,019 --> 00:34:44,940
I can sense anything.

507
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:45,739
Fighter senses.

508
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:46,940
Yeah, that's how-

509
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,300
That's what spider senses is, guys.

510
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,179
It's vibrations.

511
00:34:54,269 --> 00:34:55,150
Okay, so let me go-

512
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:58,840
It's this one.

513
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:05,659
And yeah, and a lot of time when you do this shit too, it's like-

514
00:35:05,659 --> 00:35:06,780
It's the stick over there.

515
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:08,860
Oh, wow.

516
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:09,980
Uh, self-

517
00:35:11,019 --> 00:35:11,519
Self-

518
00:35:12,219 --> 00:35:16,300
Um, self-Tennessee rattlesnake.

519
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,099
It's like that.

520
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:21,980
It's just that little piece right there and it's coiled up over there.

521
00:35:22,539 --> 00:35:24,860
And you're looking over here trying to find the fucking thing.

522
00:35:25,099 --> 00:35:26,219
You're like, oh, where is he?

523
00:35:26,219 --> 00:35:27,659
He's huge and scary.

524
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:30,139
No, he's like that little blob and he's just like sitting right there.

525
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,800
South, south, south, south Tennessee.

526
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,300
Yes.

527
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,480
Really south.

528
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,599
I'm talking like on the border.

529
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,239
Right before you cross into Oklahoma.

530
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:41,679
I don't know what's in the bottom of Tennessee.

531
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:42,179
I don't know.

532
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,039
I don't know what Tennessee touches on the bottom.

533
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:45,679
The bottom part.

534
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:47,119
It's not Oklahoma.

535
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,559
It's Kentucky?

536
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,079
Top of Kentucky?

537
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:51,760
I don't fucking know.

538
00:35:55,469 --> 00:35:57,469
I want to see the lizard!

539
00:35:57,469 --> 00:35:58,190
Where is he?

540
00:36:00,619 --> 00:36:01,739
Don't get so close.

541
00:36:01,739 --> 00:36:03,099
No, but I can't see him.

542
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:09,920
Is he in here?

543
00:36:11,019 --> 00:36:12,219
Is he in there, mommy?

544
00:36:13,019 --> 00:36:14,059
Don't go in there.

545
00:36:14,059 --> 00:36:15,179
Mommy, hold on.

546
00:36:15,179 --> 00:36:16,380
I want to find the lizard.

547
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,760
Hey, any news on the data pod?

548
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,039
Ah, your dad's head's down.

549
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:25,079
He's working on it.

550
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:26,480
He's got to be close.

551
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:26,980
Great.

552
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:32,280
Where's the lizard?

553
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,559
I don't know where he is.

554
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:38,380
It's like the back room at the zoo.

555
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,630
Oh, this is just dog food.

556
00:36:42,429 --> 00:36:48,860
Lizard.

557
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,380
No.

558
00:36:54,489 --> 00:36:54,989
Lizard.

559
00:37:09,369 --> 00:37:10,969
I'm going to find the lizard and I'll be back.

560
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:12,809
Get back here.

561
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,300
Oh, I found the lizard.

562
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,440
Oh, there's a tiger in here.

563
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:25,550
Hold on, mom.

564
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:26,349
I'll take care of this.

565
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:30,039
Oh no, it's a squirt gun.

566
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:31,079
It's a squirt gun.

567
00:37:32,409 --> 00:37:34,010
Help, help, help, help, help, help, help.

568
00:37:34,809 --> 00:37:44,090
Oh my god, that's horrible.

569
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:53,630
Oh, I shoot him.

570
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,880
Oh, shit.

571
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,420
Oh no.

572
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,440
Someone help him.

573
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:19,320
What is going on in the back of the zoo?

574
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:22,079
Oh, fuck.

575
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:26,440
Timmy, worst Alex player on Twitch.

576
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,639
Fuck, get out of here.

577
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:28,599
I'm in chapter eight.

578
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:29,880
It's been like eight hours.

579
00:38:31,769 --> 00:38:34,489
Hey, Jeff Keighley told me,

580
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:37,309
not personally, but through Twitter,

581
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:40,030
it took him like 20 hours to beat this game

582
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:40,829
because he was engrossed

583
00:38:40,829 --> 00:38:42,269
and he thought it was really fun.

584
00:38:42,269 --> 00:38:44,750
Okay, do you trust Jeff Keighley?

585
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:45,309
Because I do.

586
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:47,900
Oh, that sounded really unhinged.

587
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:48,619
Let's do that again.

588
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,460
Jeff Keighley told me

589
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,619
that this was like a 15 to 20 hour experience.

590
00:38:53,179 --> 00:38:54,219
I trust him.

591
00:38:54,219 --> 00:38:54,699
Don't you?

592
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,059
I trust him.

593
00:38:56,619 --> 00:38:57,099
That's better.

594
00:38:57,099 --> 00:38:58,380
Okay, use that one instead.

595
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,699
Not the one where I was unhinged.

596
00:39:05,289 --> 00:39:06,170
Nice acting.

597
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:07,289
No, give me that mask.

598
00:39:07,289 --> 00:39:07,769
It's mine.

599
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:18,090
What the fuck?

600
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,519
This shit is actually hard mode.

601
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:45,280
Get it off.

602
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:45,840
It's too hard.

603
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:49,119
Bye, gameplay.

604
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:53,449
I don't need to kill that one,

605
00:39:53,449 --> 00:39:55,289
but I do want to get rid of this one.

606
00:39:55,289 --> 00:39:55,769
No, I don't.

607
00:39:58,489 --> 00:40:03,360
Hey, bird in there?

608
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,000
Bird's in there.

609
00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:08,599
I knew I saw something.

610
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,639
Oh shit, now we're getting into it.

611
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:24,800
Now we're getting into it.

612
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,960
This is actually Jurassic Park.

613
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,039
And wait a minute.

614
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:35,659
Why did somebody make a Jurassic Park VR game?

615
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,440
Are you kidding me?

616
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,480
Why has nobody done that yet?

617
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:40,320
It's like the perfect platform

618
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,480
for like a scary watch out for the raptors.

619
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,280
They're going to chase you.

620
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,480
This exact environment.

621
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:11,630
It really is the Jurassic Park.

622
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:12,349
I love this.

623
00:41:13,469 --> 00:41:16,079
I forget I'm in Half-Life right now.

624
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,300
That's how you can tell

625
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,460
that the devs just did such a fucking good job.

626
00:41:22,059 --> 00:41:23,820
I'm getting immersed in Jurassic Park

627
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:24,860
and it's not even that game.

628
00:41:25,579 --> 00:41:36,219
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.

629
00:41:36,219 --> 00:41:43,920
It's one shot, one kill.

630
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:46,409
Oh, a grenade.

631
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:50,079
Open.

632
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:58,909
He sounds so sad when you take it.

633
00:41:58,909 --> 00:41:59,630
He's like, oh.

634
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:13,119
Can I have another one, please?

635
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:25,760
That again?

636
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,480
That again.

637
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:32,880
Chrono trigger.

638
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,239
That's the sound effect from Chrono Trigger.

639
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:37,280
That's the sound that makes a lot of enemies

640
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:37,760
make this like.

641
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,079
It's that exact sound.

642
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:40,719
I think it's the same sound.

643
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:45,449
I guess no one's talking anymore.

644
00:42:46,090 --> 00:43:03,639
Oh, grenade in there.

645
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:08,989
Oh, there's a lot of grenades just everywhere.

646
00:43:09,949 --> 00:43:10,989
I don't know why.

647
00:43:11,949 --> 00:43:12,449
Let's.

648
00:43:12,909 --> 00:43:16,139
Goodbye.

649
00:43:17,949 --> 00:43:19,230
I threw them and it scared me.

650
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:19,789
It doesn't matter.

651
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:25,079
Why is there so much?

652
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:25,960
Why are there so many of these?

653
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:30,519
Maybe there's something fucked up down here.

654
00:43:30,519 --> 00:43:41,039
I know it.

655
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:45,610
Uh.

656
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:46,329
Oh, shit.

657
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:48,829
Go on, pop.

658
00:43:49,469 --> 00:43:51,070
Pop.

659
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:53,400
Pop.

660
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,039
Pop.

661
00:43:54,039 --> 00:44:11,880
What the hell is even in here?

662
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,400
Why is all this shit blowing up around me?

663
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:28,119
It's the story.

664
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:30,110
I got something.

665
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:30,829
Yeah.

666
00:44:30,829 --> 00:44:31,150
What is it, Bob?

667
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:31,869
Story?

668
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:34,349
It doesn't look like they actually built the weapon.

669
00:44:34,349 --> 00:44:44,300
It's like they brought it to an old apartment building in the QC.

670
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:46,860
But instead of going in to get it,

671
00:44:47,579 --> 00:44:50,460
they grabbed the whole building and built a vault around it.

672
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:50,960
Wow.

673
00:44:52,059 --> 00:44:52,780
Holy crap.

674
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:54,380
They must have been terrified of this thing.

675
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:56,699
I'm trying to figure out whether we ought to be.

676
00:44:58,670 --> 00:44:59,389
All right.

677
00:44:59,389 --> 00:45:00,269
That was a good story.

678
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:02,110
I'd like to hear a little more.

679
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:08,039
Oh, he's got a mask on.

680
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:09,400
That's.

681
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:10,840
Oh, we lost it.

682
00:45:11,559 --> 00:45:12,360
Lost it.

683
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,159
But, um.

684
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,320
Now's not the time for you to do this.

685
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,760
Now's not the time for you to do this.

686
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:19,480
Now's not the time.

687
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,519
Now's not the time.

688
00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:21,239
Now's not the time.

689
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:30,039
I don't want to waste ammo.

690
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:39,039
Give me it.

691
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:54,570
All right.

692
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:54,889
I got it.

693
00:45:54,889 --> 00:45:55,210
I got it.

694
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:55,449
I got it.

695
00:45:55,449 --> 00:45:56,010
I got it.

696
00:45:56,010 --> 00:46:02,639
I didn't want to waste a bunch of ammo.

697
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:04,079
That would have been like 10 shots.

698
00:46:10,829 --> 00:46:12,030
I hear something.

699
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:14,460
Oh, now you want to give it to me.

700
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:16,059
Not when there's danger around.

701
00:46:16,059 --> 00:46:17,179
Oh, my goodness.

702
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:23,039
Where did he go?

703
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:35,690
Oh, it's so easy.

704
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:45,289
No voice.

705
00:46:45,929 --> 00:46:48,800
Oh, there's a bunch of supplies in here.

706
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:49,760
Thanks for telling me to go back.

707
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:52,239
Imagine if I didn't get this supply.

708
00:46:53,039 --> 00:46:58,199
Fuck, no way.

709
00:46:58,199 --> 00:46:59,559
GTX 780?

710
00:47:00,519 --> 00:47:03,309
Dude, I'll be able to play at 60.

711
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:13,679
Hang on, over here?

712
00:47:13,679 --> 00:47:17,519
780, that's trash.

713
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,880
780 is not trash.

714
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:25,739
You could still play a decent amount of games on 780.

715
00:47:25,739 --> 00:47:29,599
Guys, not everybody wants to play every game at like 4K.

716
00:47:32,679 --> 00:47:34,360
I can't get up there.

717
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:40,199
What ADP?

718
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:43,210
Um, no, no.

719
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:47,849
You could definitely run like Counter-Strike at like 1080, 40.

720
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:49,530
But does it really matter?

721
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:50,250
Some people don't care.

722
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:55,920
Guys, if you think people really care that much, where are you?

723
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,119
If you think people care that much about like frame rates and resolutions,

724
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:02,639
we played on the fucking PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 for two decades.

725
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:07,760
That shit was running like 25, 1080, to the 60, 720.

726
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,119
You think people really care that much?

727
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:14,000
I mean, I do.

728
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:15,280
And you do.

729
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,980
Human eye can't even see past eight frames a second anyways.

730
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:25,659
My doctor told me.

731
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:30,940
What the hell is this?

732
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:36,719
Russ, do you think a headcrab could turn a gorilla into a zombie?

733
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:42,079
Honestly, if there's a gorilla on the loose, I'm not sure a headcrab can make it much worse.

734
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:43,599
Is this foreshadowing?

735
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:47,039
Are we going to have to fight a giant gorilla with a headcrab on him?

736
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:49,440
Oh no, that would be bad.

737
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,449
That would be very bad, actually.

738
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:58,219
Is this why you wanted me to come in here?

739
00:49:04,809 --> 00:49:13,119
I saw the gorilla, cool.

740
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:16,960
How is this lore?

741
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:18,559
I skipped lore?

742
00:49:21,579 --> 00:49:23,820
It's just, hey, look, there's a statue of a gorilla over here.

743
00:49:24,699 --> 00:49:35,579
No, no, I didn't see like 10 minutes of extra dialogue and lore.

744
00:49:35,579 --> 00:49:37,820
I just saw, I wasted 10 minutes looking at a statue.

745
00:49:38,619 --> 00:49:43,119
It's precious time playing Half-Life.

746
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,239
Birds, I love birds.

747
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,579
I really do.

748
00:49:49,579 --> 00:49:51,820
I love birds, especially crows.

749
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:52,940
I love crows.

750
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:56,300
I think they're the smartest, most awesome animal next to a rat.

751
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:59,159
I'm seeing a pattern, though.

752
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:02,360
I like fucking crows and like rats.

753
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:06,119
I like all the things that the Bible tells you to avoid

754
00:50:06,119 --> 00:50:07,719
because they kind of possess you and kill you.

755
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:09,289
Why?

756
00:50:09,289 --> 00:50:10,480
Isn't that weird?

757
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:16,489
I don't like crows and rats and all kinds of,

758
00:50:16,489 --> 00:50:18,250
aren't they like the dirty animals in the Bible?

759
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:22,889
Don't they like, don't they like?

760
00:50:24,059 --> 00:50:26,139
Satanist, you're a Satanist.

761
00:50:26,139 --> 00:50:28,519
All right, is it Satanist or is this Satanist?

762
00:50:32,269 --> 00:50:33,789
I'm a Satanist, I don't,

763
00:50:33,789 --> 00:50:39,309
I don't like, why you think I like to worship Satan?

764
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:42,750
No, why would I do that?

765
00:50:43,630 --> 00:50:51,769
Stuttering, because he's a Satanist.

766
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,360
Okay, telling me that I'm a Satanist

767
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:00,199
doesn't mean that I practice Satanism.

768
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:02,440
Like I turn the lights off

769
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,039
and I put a bunch of red candles around me

770
00:51:04,039 --> 00:51:05,079
and I sit in the middle

771
00:51:05,079 --> 00:51:07,719
and I start asking for fucking like plagues and shit.

772
00:51:07,719 --> 00:51:09,079
Like what does that mean?

773
00:51:10,619 --> 00:51:12,699
I don't, I'm not a practicing Satanist.

774
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:15,179
I don't care, what do you want me to tell you?

775
00:51:15,179 --> 00:51:34,590
Okay, Dark Lord, around me are my enemies, who I really am.

776
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:40,699
My friends, I'm worth it.

777
00:51:40,699 --> 00:51:43,050
Give me the strength.

778
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:46,829
Hopefully you give me some kind of superpowers

779
00:51:46,829 --> 00:51:48,110
because that's really what I want.

780
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:53,000
So, fill me with your fear and yeah,

781
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,840
you know, I could really use, you know, like venom.

782
00:51:56,170 --> 00:51:57,530
I would love the venom symbiote,

783
00:51:57,530 --> 00:51:58,809
like to be in me right now

784
00:51:58,809 --> 00:52:00,730
and we could like go on adventures and shit.

785
00:52:01,530 --> 00:52:03,130
You know, if you want me to be your,

786
00:52:03,130 --> 00:52:04,969
come on, I've produced the superpowers

787
00:52:04,969 --> 00:52:06,090
if the intercom isn't working.

788
00:52:06,969 --> 00:52:10,639
Okay, I'll try next week.

789
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:12,880
Another series of candles.

790
00:52:19,659 --> 00:52:20,619
Oh, an offering.

791
00:52:22,329 --> 00:52:23,690
No way, dude, it worked.

792
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,039
Okay, I'm gonna tell the world.

793
00:52:31,679 --> 00:52:35,949
Ooh, fish.

794
00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:40,199
Dude, Satan coming through with a clutch.

795
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:46,360
Why am I carrying this around still?

796
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,760
But no, I thought I don't practice Satanism.

797
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:49,639
I don't practice anything.

798
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:53,679
I don't practice setting up my streams.

799
00:52:53,679 --> 00:52:54,719
I don't practice the drums.

800
00:52:54,719 --> 00:52:55,840
I don't practice religion.

801
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:57,679
I'm practice-less.

802
00:52:57,679 --> 00:52:58,400
I don't do anything.

803
00:53:00,059 --> 00:53:02,860
Okay, it's like eating Cheetos on the couch.

804
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:06,460
Me practicing anything and like watching Netflix.

805
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:07,260
Does that count?

806
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:10,380
I'm a practicing Netflix viewer.

807
00:53:14,239 --> 00:53:14,800
It is.

808
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:15,519
Practice me.

809
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:17,199
All right, ban that guy.

810
00:53:23,789 --> 00:53:28,670
Ow, why am I carrying this?

811
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:30,590
This is like a stress ball at this point.

812
00:53:31,309 --> 00:53:35,289
Like, it's okay, the antlions can't get me.

813
00:53:37,769 --> 00:53:38,570
Ow, who are you?

814
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:42,030
I actually really like this area, though.

815
00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:45,929
You don't see very many, like, zoo exhibits.

816
00:53:56,969 --> 00:54:03,800
I know they're all connected up here.

817
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:06,760
Can I, like, put the grenade up and over into his chamber?

818
00:54:07,639 --> 00:54:09,079
Oh my god, okay.

819
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:09,559
I knew it.

820
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:24,119
I'm just waiting for that gorilla with the head grab.

821
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:25,320
I know it's gonna happen.

822
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:27,400
You guys made me go look at that for some reason.

823
00:54:37,289 --> 00:54:39,050
Sorry, whatever animal is in there.

824
00:54:39,929 --> 00:54:45,389
Thank you.

825
00:54:45,389 --> 00:54:46,190
I'll take that.

826
00:54:46,190 --> 00:54:46,670
Thank you.

827
00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:49,480
All right, I'm ready.

828
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:58,670
Wait, they were shooting at the aliens.

829
00:54:58,670 --> 00:54:59,469
Why did I just do that?

830
00:54:59,469 --> 00:55:00,190
They could have helped.

831
00:55:00,829 --> 00:55:05,659
Kind of gross, whatever that is.

832
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:14,719
Oh, this is broken.

833
00:55:14,719 --> 00:55:15,280
I'm gonna have to get it.

834
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:16,960
You know what?

835
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,320
I think this is a good indicator

836
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:19,840
that I'm just gonna get the knuckle controllers

837
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:21,119
because this is actually broken.

838
00:55:23,519 --> 00:55:23,920
Wait a minute.

839
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,679
This is the T-Rex scene.

840
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:29,130
This is actually the T-Rex scene.

841
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:31,840
This truck flipped over

842
00:55:32,159 --> 00:55:33,840
and the kids are watching the drink.

843
00:55:35,519 --> 00:55:36,079
Right?

844
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:37,960
Oh, Anto, you wanna get out?

845
00:55:38,679 --> 00:55:40,039
I felt the vibrations.

846
00:55:40,039 --> 00:55:40,760
He wants to get out.

847
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:42,280
All right, go on, go on.

848
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:53,690
The gun was not...

849
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:08,190
Holy shit, that was so horrible.

850
00:56:09,389 --> 00:56:10,989
Not prepared for that.

851
00:56:10,989 --> 00:56:12,110
It's not even on my head.

852
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:14,190
I'm underwater right now.

853
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:15,710
I can't even see what I'm shooting at.

854
00:56:16,269 --> 00:56:17,150
It's just blurry.

855
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:18,429
It's just blurry.

856
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:22,539
I held my eyes underwater in a chlorine pool.

857
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:27,480
What?

858
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:40,559
Get the fuck out of here.

859
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:51,420
Okay, can I please put my headset

860
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:52,940
back on normal right correctly, please?

861
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:57,949
All right, we're good.

862
00:56:57,949 --> 00:57:05,760
Fucking pause the game.

863
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:07,840
I don't have to.

864
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,280
Oh, now there's like...

865
00:57:10,239 --> 00:57:10,639
Just like...

866
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:12,960
There's gross stuff in here now.

867
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,519
That's another thing that sucks about VR.

868
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:16,719
When you take the headset off,

869
00:57:16,719 --> 00:57:20,000
the sweat from your hair drags across both lenses.

870
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,719
And then when you put it back on, it's over.

871
00:57:22,719 --> 00:57:23,519
You have to clean the whole thing.

872
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:32,510
Pause the game.

873
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:32,909
I'm good.

874
00:57:33,710 --> 00:57:34,349
I can see them.

875
00:57:34,349 --> 00:57:36,110
Like, I have the stream preview right there.

876
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:40,860
Oh, dude.

877
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:41,579
Game of Grease.

878
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:44,380
That's disgusting, but I'll let it pass.

879
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:46,349
Well, you know what?

880
00:57:47,150 --> 00:57:50,639
I'm in the mode for five minutes.

881
00:57:50,639 --> 00:57:51,530
It's disgusting.

882
00:57:52,090 --> 00:57:55,550
That's just...

883
00:57:55,550 --> 00:57:56,110
That's gross.

884
00:57:56,110 --> 00:57:57,630
Don't say gross things in my stream.

885
00:57:58,190 --> 00:58:00,269
We have to keep it...

886
00:58:00,269 --> 00:58:02,349
It's PG-13, remember?

887
00:58:04,110 --> 00:58:05,150
Don't do this shit.

888
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:06,670
This is a PG-13 stream.

889
00:58:07,230 --> 00:58:09,710
I know you clicked on mature R-rated content,

890
00:58:10,429 --> 00:58:13,099
but that's how I act.

891
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:15,260
You have to act a certain way.

892
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:17,820
I act like R-rated and you act PG.

893
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:19,579
And if you act R, then you get banned.

894
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:19,820
Right?

895
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:21,260
That's how it works on Twitch, isn't it?

896
00:58:22,139 --> 00:58:25,639
You say something gross, then you get banned.

897
00:58:25,639 --> 00:58:27,000
If I say something gross, look at me.

898
00:58:27,639 --> 00:58:32,110
That hit somebody behind...

899
00:58:32,110 --> 00:58:33,150
That hit somebody...

900
00:58:33,150 --> 00:58:34,590
Somebody was just sneaking up behind me

901
00:58:34,590 --> 00:58:35,869
and it hit them in the fucking face.

902
00:58:37,309 --> 00:58:37,789
Thank you.

903
00:58:37,789 --> 00:58:38,269
I got it.

904
00:58:39,070 --> 00:58:41,099
I don't know how I got ammo.

905
00:58:41,099 --> 00:58:41,900
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

906
00:58:42,539 --> 00:58:48,730
I...

907
00:58:48,730 --> 00:58:49,929
All right, we got to get this shit.

908
00:58:50,809 --> 00:58:55,389
Oh, we got five community subs from Nukeable.

909
00:58:56,349 --> 00:58:58,139
Thank you, Nukeable.

910
00:58:58,139 --> 00:58:59,019
Thanks to the five subs.

911
00:58:59,019 --> 00:58:59,659
Welcome, guys.

912
00:59:01,150 --> 00:59:02,590
Hey, we love our subs here.

913
00:59:03,309 --> 00:59:08,860
Thanks.

914
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:09,900
We love our subs here.

915
00:59:10,539 --> 00:59:16,800
Is that all we got?

916
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,449
I love this area.

917
00:59:19,449 --> 00:59:20,889
This is my favorite area of the game so far.

918
00:59:21,610 --> 00:59:32,190
Oh, it's smoky in here.

919
00:59:32,989 --> 00:59:42,960
This is the best area of the game.

920
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:43,679
Yeah, for sure.

921
00:59:43,679 --> 00:59:44,159
I love it.

922
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,219
Moon it for me.

923
00:59:46,219 --> 00:59:48,860
I like this better than kind of just the city 17

924
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:50,380
corridors and buildings.

925
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:52,940
I mean, it's cool, like nostalgia purposes,

926
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:53,980
but this is new shit.

927
00:59:54,699 --> 00:59:55,900
This is new shit.

928
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:56,619
I like it a lot.

929
00:59:57,820 --> 01:00:05,159
From a moon rising?

930
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:18,400
Oh, okay, we don't want that.

931
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:22,300
I would have just walked into that.

932
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:24,219
Good thing I'm hyper intelligent.

933
01:00:24,219 --> 01:00:31,659
I suspect neutralized.

934
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:34,860
Call off entire investigation.

935
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:41,210
Order me number one on Postmates.

936
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:46,159
And drop it off at the door where the electricity room is.

937
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:47,360
Don't come in.

938
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:47,920
I'm busy.

939
01:01:02,510 --> 01:01:07,079
Oh, my God, there's an explosive.

940
01:01:07,719 --> 01:01:09,159
No, bring this in here with me.

941
01:01:09,159 --> 01:01:10,360
He's going to walk into the ship.

942
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:13,849
He's going to close the door.

943
01:01:13,849 --> 01:01:14,489
Don't touch it.

944
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:17,150
He's going to walk into that.

945
01:01:17,789 --> 01:01:20,809
It's not going to explode.

946
01:01:20,809 --> 01:01:21,369
Okay, how do I?

947
01:01:21,369 --> 01:01:23,849
Can I take all the air out of that thing?

948
01:01:23,849 --> 01:01:24,650
Can I just like go?

949
01:01:26,409 --> 01:01:28,559
What about the door close?

950
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:29,599
I'll pass out.

951
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:31,280
It'll fuck me up, won't it?

952
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:40,699
What do I do with all this stuff?

953
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,440
It's the Postmates guy.

954
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:53,289
Hey, hey, dude.

955
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:58,590
Yeah, I know you drove by the house like four or five times.

956
01:01:59,070 --> 01:02:00,670
Just leave it out on the curb.

957
01:02:00,670 --> 01:02:01,309
I'll go get it.

958
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:03,789
I know it's hard to find.

959
01:02:03,789 --> 01:02:04,989
Just leave it out on the curb, dude.

960
01:02:05,789 --> 01:02:09,869
He leaves it under the curb and another car drives by

961
01:02:09,869 --> 01:02:11,710
and just runs over your lunch.

962
01:02:12,590 --> 01:02:13,389
Oh, stop.

963
01:02:16,349 --> 01:02:20,519
Oh, I'm fucking out of here.

964
01:02:20,519 --> 01:02:23,420
Don't throw that.

965
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:26,489
Where is he?

966
01:02:28,329 --> 01:02:31,099
How do I go like, can you hear me?

967
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:33,469
I don't want to use it.

968
01:02:41,469 --> 01:02:42,110
What?

969
01:02:42,110 --> 01:02:44,760
Okay, over here.

970
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:46,679
Just leave it at the door.

971
01:02:47,559 --> 01:02:48,840
He's stuck over there.

972
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:49,960
I just turn him off.

973
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:51,400
He's not going to get over here in time.

974
01:02:52,679 --> 01:02:53,400
Wait, maybe he is.

975
01:02:55,369 --> 01:02:57,210
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

976
01:02:57,210 --> 01:02:58,090
I'm realizing this right now.

977
01:02:58,090 --> 01:02:59,050
Give me this.

978
01:02:59,050 --> 01:03:01,530
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

979
01:03:01,530 --> 01:03:02,329
It's going to blow the room up.

980
01:03:05,150 --> 01:03:05,650
I got him.

981
01:03:06,670 --> 01:03:07,550
Okay, we're going to...

982
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:10,829
This is like happens in every like movie where there's a prison scene.

983
01:03:10,829 --> 01:03:11,949
The little thing opens.

984
01:03:11,949 --> 01:03:13,550
Here's your lunch, you bastard.

985
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:28,059
Okay, I think I'm safe.

986
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:31,469
Where is he?

987
01:03:31,469 --> 01:03:41,250
Let's go anywhere else.

988
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:42,530
Wait, let's go somewhere else.

989
01:03:43,090 --> 01:03:45,170
Holy fuck, don't touch that.

990
01:03:45,170 --> 01:03:47,969
Turn it off, turn it off, turn it off, turn it off, turn it off, turn it off, turn it off.

991
01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:49,650
Wait, where does this go?

992
01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:50,449
There's something else here.

993
01:03:51,250 --> 01:03:52,610
Let's see, whatever, fuck it, let's go.

994
01:04:02,159 --> 01:04:05,469
Where is he?

995
01:04:05,469 --> 01:04:06,269
Where did that guy go?

996
01:04:06,269 --> 01:04:12,179
Okay.

997
01:04:12,179 --> 01:04:13,380
Hammer mode activated.

998
01:04:14,719 --> 01:04:15,219
Bladed.

999
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:19,309
I think I did it too early.

1000
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:31,650
And that's so many times.

1001
01:04:31,650 --> 01:04:34,849
I can't do the like, hoo-hoo thing every time I kill somebody.

1002
01:04:35,650 --> 01:04:38,059
I'm going to make a compilation of that and it's going to be...

1003
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:41,599
Oh, drink it.

1004
01:04:45,710 --> 01:04:46,670
You have to.

1005
01:04:46,670 --> 01:04:47,469
No, I don't.

1006
01:04:48,269 --> 01:04:50,449
Oh, there it is.

1007
01:04:50,449 --> 01:04:51,809
I don't even need it though.

1008
01:04:51,809 --> 01:04:52,610
I really don't even need it.

1009
01:04:53,329 --> 01:04:55,469
Put on ammo.

1010
01:04:55,469 --> 01:04:57,309
Good, good, not good, good, good.

1011
01:04:57,309 --> 01:04:58,269
Okay, we're good, good.

1012
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:00,980
Better.

1013
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:12,769
I really like the SMG.

1014
01:05:13,570 --> 01:05:16,210
I feel like the grenade launcher is cool and it might be fun, but

1015
01:05:16,210 --> 01:05:18,449
how many grenades am I going to find from here on out?

1016
01:05:19,170 --> 01:05:21,309
I don't think very many.

1017
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:36,449
Will they make a dead space in VR?

1018
01:05:36,449 --> 01:05:38,130
I've never played them, but I know how they work.

1019
01:05:39,329 --> 01:05:41,440
Imagine like a dead space VR.

1020
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,800
Those of you that have played the game, I'm just pretending to be a fan.

1021
01:05:45,519 --> 01:05:46,320
That's how it works.

1022
01:06:02,610 --> 01:06:03,489
I told you he was alive.

1023
01:06:04,289 --> 01:06:05,409
He was alive.

1024
01:06:05,409 --> 01:06:06,050
I told you.

1025
01:06:07,090 --> 01:06:09,969
Everyone that tells me that I shouldn't have been doing that all game.

1026
01:06:10,690 --> 01:06:11,409
Right?

1027
01:06:11,409 --> 01:06:12,449
He was sitting there waiting.

1028
01:06:12,449 --> 01:06:14,210
I shot him in the head and I killed him and he dropped the grenade.

1029
01:06:15,170 --> 01:06:17,739
Beth, you can thank me.

1030
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:20,500
Thank me for being fucking aware.

1031
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:25,659
Dead space is third person.

1032
01:06:25,659 --> 01:06:27,739
Stop pretending to be a streamer.

1033
01:06:27,739 --> 01:06:29,519
What the hell would you call me then?

1034
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:33,219
What else am I?

1035
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:35,920
Bill's here.

1036
01:06:38,750 --> 01:06:39,469
Bill's here.

1037
01:06:40,429 --> 01:06:41,309
Bill's here.

1038
01:06:42,530 --> 01:06:43,030
Bill's...

1039
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:44,400
Bill's...

1040
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:46,139
No, this is it.

1041
01:06:46,139 --> 01:06:47,579
This is the correct reference.

1042
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:52,659
Bill's here.

1043
01:06:54,269 --> 01:06:54,909
Use that part.

1044
01:06:55,469 --> 01:07:02,300
When you make the video, you get a quick cut.

1045
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:04,539
So it's just like, it's so crazy and then...

1046
01:07:04,539 --> 01:07:05,420
Bill's here.

1047
01:07:05,420 --> 01:07:06,699
Back to the action.

1048
01:07:06,699 --> 01:07:07,500
It's a prison.

1049
01:07:08,059 --> 01:07:09,900
They didn't build it to keep us out.

1050
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:11,980
They're trying to keep something...

1051
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:13,260
Keep what in?

1052
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:14,300
I don't know.

1053
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:16,460
I'm not sure if this data part even knows.

1054
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:18,619
But they got something trapped in there.

1055
01:07:18,619 --> 01:07:20,840
Okay.

1056
01:07:21,940 --> 01:07:25,539
So if it's not a weapon, are we still doing this?

1057
01:07:25,539 --> 01:07:26,579
The way I see it.

1058
01:07:26,579 --> 01:07:28,579
Whatever's in there doesn't like the combine very much.

1059
01:07:28,579 --> 01:07:29,380
Whatever's in there?

1060
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:30,739
So we got that in common.

1061
01:07:30,739 --> 01:07:33,539
Are we gonna turn up to be the gorilla with the, uh, with the head grab?

1062
01:07:33,539 --> 01:07:34,739
Are we still doing this?

1063
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:36,500
We've come this far.

1064
01:07:37,539 --> 01:07:38,579
I say we keep going.

1065
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:43,219
And if you find out it's something we really shouldn't mess with, we'll call it off.

1066
01:07:43,219 --> 01:07:44,099
That's my girl.

1067
01:07:44,099 --> 01:07:45,730
I'll let you know when I find out.

1068
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:48,909
They're keeping the gorilla in there.

1069
01:07:50,239 --> 01:07:50,739
Oh.

1070
01:07:52,159 --> 01:07:52,960
Explosive.

1071
01:07:57,710 --> 01:07:59,309
I'm so far away right now.

1072
01:08:01,469 --> 01:08:02,670
I'm so far away.

1073
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:08,800
Alica?

1074
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:13,349
I'm so far away.

1075
01:08:13,349 --> 01:08:13,829
What song?

1076
01:08:13,829 --> 01:08:14,949
Who, who sings that?

1077
01:08:14,949 --> 01:08:15,670
Is that Metallica?

1078
01:08:16,789 --> 01:08:18,000
Shoot them.

1079
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:18,960
What a waste of ammo.

1080
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:22,569
What is that?

1081
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:25,680
Does God smack?

1082
01:08:28,899 --> 01:08:30,340
Why did that pop in here?

1083
01:08:31,060 --> 01:08:35,189
The word I haven't heard that toast two words.

1084
01:08:36,069 --> 01:08:43,140
The light.

1085
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:47,680
God smack.

1086
01:08:49,199 --> 01:08:49,920
Oh, wait.

1087
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:51,520
That's just to turn on these lights?

1088
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:53,250
Hold on.

1089
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:54,050
No, no, no, no, no.

1090
01:08:54,050 --> 01:08:54,850
That goes up here.

1091
01:08:55,489 --> 01:08:57,479
That there.

1092
01:08:57,479 --> 01:08:59,189
Goes up there.

1093
01:09:00,149 --> 01:09:00,869
And then it goes down this way.

1094
01:09:01,590 --> 01:09:02,960
If I turn something on.

1095
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:04,399
Goodness, don't fall.

1096
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:09,760
Jeff better not be here anymore.

1097
01:09:11,810 --> 01:09:12,310
Livid.

1098
01:09:12,850 --> 01:09:15,840
No, I crushed, I crushed Jeff.

1099
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:17,439
He's not coming back.

1100
01:09:18,239 --> 01:09:32,149
Button, yes, I can't press it.

1101
01:09:32,789 --> 01:09:34,149
We can go in there.

1102
01:09:34,149 --> 01:09:35,979
Here.

1103
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:40,100
There.

1104
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:42,859
Shit.

1105
01:09:42,859 --> 01:09:44,680
Okay, so what the heck is going on here?

1106
01:09:47,670 --> 01:09:48,229
Power for this?

1107
01:09:48,229 --> 01:09:49,510
We gotta turn the power off here.

1108
01:09:50,310 --> 01:09:54,920
We don't, actually.

1109
01:09:55,399 --> 01:10:00,819
Am I missing something here?

1110
01:10:05,399 --> 01:10:06,760
All right, so where the fuck does this go?

1111
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:16,600
Green wire.

1112
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:18,250
Here.

1113
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,279
Oh, my God.

1114
01:10:21,279 --> 01:10:22,159
How do I get up there?

1115
01:10:23,279 --> 01:10:24,729
What?

1116
01:10:26,279 --> 01:10:26,779
Are you?

1117
01:10:28,039 --> 01:10:29,569
Do it already.

1118
01:10:30,130 --> 01:10:30,630
Pop.

1119
01:10:30,630 --> 01:10:31,130
Pop.

1120
01:10:41,159 --> 01:10:41,800
Connect.

1121
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:44,899
Now this goes.

1122
01:10:48,050 --> 01:10:48,550
Here.

1123
01:10:56,180 --> 01:10:58,369
Blue wire.

1124
01:10:58,930 --> 01:11:00,060
To.

1125
01:11:04,789 --> 01:11:05,529
Okay.

1126
01:11:06,069 --> 01:11:07,890
Blue wire connected to.

1127
01:11:08,770 --> 01:11:24,760
Blue wire up there.

1128
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:25,720
Wait, I need to follow the.

1129
01:11:32,689 --> 01:11:33,810
Yeah, but what the fuck?

1130
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:38,260
Blue.

1131
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:39,859
Blue wire.

1132
01:11:40,420 --> 01:11:40,979
Blue wire.

1133
01:11:44,579 --> 01:11:45,300
Oh, yeah.

1134
01:11:46,819 --> 01:11:56,329
Good.

1135
01:11:58,229 --> 01:11:58,729
Good.

1136
01:11:58,789 --> 01:11:59,289
Power on.

1137
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:01,920
Power activated.

1138
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:02,960
That was tricky.

1139
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:04,630
Don't do it.

1140
01:12:04,630 --> 01:12:05,029
Don't do it.

1141
01:12:05,029 --> 01:12:05,430
Don't do it.

1142
01:12:05,430 --> 01:12:05,829
Don't do it.

1143
01:12:05,829 --> 01:12:06,329
Don't do it.

1144
01:12:07,409 --> 01:12:07,970
Don't do it.

1145
01:12:07,970 --> 01:12:08,470
Don't jump.

1146
01:12:09,010 --> 01:12:13,979
Don't do it.

1147
01:12:14,439 --> 01:12:25,739
All right.

1148
01:12:27,319 --> 01:12:28,920
I'm not wasting any fucking time here.

1149
01:12:38,899 --> 01:12:39,779
Why would I waste time?

1150
01:12:56,149 --> 01:12:57,590
My fucking God, what happened?

1151
01:12:58,310 --> 01:13:02,119
Here, go home.

1152
01:13:02,279 --> 01:13:03,159
No more animals.

1153
01:13:04,390 --> 01:13:06,390
Oh, I mean, it's my birthday.

1154
01:13:07,189 --> 01:13:20,539
Is it here?

1155
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:22,199
Here, all right, go.

1156
01:13:24,789 --> 01:13:27,829
Oh my God, I thought that was a real tiger.

1157
01:13:28,390 --> 01:13:30,949
Holy shit, that would have been insane.

1158
01:13:31,670 --> 01:13:32,630
Can you imagine?

1159
01:13:33,590 --> 01:13:36,470
Can you imagine if that was a fucking.

1160
01:13:36,470 --> 01:13:37,989
A tiger just chilling.

1161
01:13:38,869 --> 01:13:40,630
Just waiting for me to show.

1162
01:13:40,630 --> 01:13:41,270
Look at him, he's like.

1163
01:13:42,470 --> 01:13:43,510
He's huge.

1164
01:13:45,199 --> 01:13:46,720
Oh, that's silly.

1165
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:49,520
That's just silly, Val.

1166
01:13:52,720 --> 01:14:00,899
I wish it was a real tiger.

1167
01:14:00,899 --> 01:14:15,399
Throw your face.

1168
01:14:15,399 --> 01:14:15,960
Throw your face.

1169
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:18,600
Throw yourself.

1170
01:14:19,399 --> 01:14:23,109
Throw yourself.

1171
01:14:23,109 --> 01:14:23,750
Throw yourself.

1172
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:26,600
Throw yourself.

1173
01:14:27,319 --> 01:14:51,109
Okay, we're in this room now.

1174
01:14:52,470 --> 01:14:54,300
Grenade.

1175
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:57,560
So, uh, it's gonna be another puzzle.

1176
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:59,880
Wait, we have a little force of the power.

1177
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:02,899
Oh, look, here's your auto.

1178
01:15:03,619 --> 01:15:11,090
Here's your auto.

1179
01:15:11,729 --> 01:15:12,539
What's this?

1180
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:14,220
You.

1181
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:15,020
Right there.

1182
01:15:16,119 --> 01:15:16,840
Yeah, gross.

1183
01:15:18,630 --> 01:15:19,130
Gross.

1184
01:15:19,430 --> 01:15:19,930
Yeah.

1185
01:15:20,229 --> 01:15:20,729
Yeah.

1186
01:15:21,189 --> 01:15:23,479
This is delicious water.

1187
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:27,420
Thank you.

1188
01:15:31,140 --> 01:15:32,020
Wait, more toys.

1189
01:15:35,539 --> 01:15:36,500
It's me and auto.

1190
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:40,039
Hey, auto.

1191
01:15:40,039 --> 01:15:41,239
Are you a good boy?

1192
01:15:41,239 --> 01:15:42,119
Yes, I am, Jeremy.

1193
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:45,239
Oh, let's have a go on an adventure together.

1194
01:15:45,239 --> 01:15:45,880
Yes, let's go.

1195
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:48,340
Okay, let's go together.

1196
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:49,699
Hey, can I have a hug?

1197
01:15:49,699 --> 01:15:50,199
Yes.

1198
01:15:56,850 --> 01:15:57,350
Okay.

1199
01:15:59,010 --> 01:16:01,350
It got a little weird.

1200
01:16:02,149 --> 01:16:03,670
That was not my intention, but you know.

1201
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:10,279
I wanted to just struggle with my dog, okay?

1202
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:16,390
That straight up derailed.

1203
01:16:17,829 --> 01:16:19,670
No, what we're supposed to be is supposed to be like,

1204
01:16:19,670 --> 01:16:21,029
look, me and auto are like,

1205
01:16:22,069 --> 01:16:24,710
who doesn't give their dog like little kisses, okay?

1206
01:16:24,710 --> 01:16:25,210
Please.

1207
01:16:27,029 --> 01:16:27,529
You.

1208
01:16:28,470 --> 01:16:29,510
You made that weird.

1209
01:16:30,069 --> 01:16:30,869
I didn't.

1210
01:16:30,869 --> 01:16:32,310
I could sense you.

1211
01:16:32,310 --> 01:16:32,789
Where are you?

1212
01:16:32,789 --> 01:16:33,670
I could sense you.

1213
01:16:33,670 --> 01:16:34,789
Can you see me?

1214
01:16:34,789 --> 01:16:36,710
I could sense you making that weird.

1215
01:16:36,710 --> 01:16:37,670
That's why I freaked out.

1216
01:16:38,470 --> 01:17:02,149
I gotta play the game.

1217
01:17:05,970 --> 01:17:07,649
Just kill this motherfucker up here.

1218
01:17:08,529 --> 01:17:19,779
I'm not a furry.

1219
01:17:22,850 --> 01:17:24,050
Okay, who cares?

1220
01:17:29,649 --> 01:17:30,689
Oh shit.

1221
01:17:30,689 --> 01:17:31,649
Reconnect the power.

1222
01:17:32,770 --> 01:17:35,760
Oh my goodness.

1223
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:36,880
Something happened over here.

1224
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:43,680
Wait, that just redirected the power to here.

1225
01:17:45,489 --> 01:17:48,050
A bus access this.

1226
01:17:49,090 --> 01:17:53,270
That's in the monster.

1227
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:04,680
This is what I was working towards.

1228
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:06,600
A TV joke.

1229
01:18:07,239 --> 01:18:09,000
They're giving me access to a TV joke.

1230
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:09,720
Holy shit.

1231
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:10,920
That's what exactly what.

1232
01:18:12,899 --> 01:18:13,380
In break.

1233
01:18:13,380 --> 01:18:13,859
It's in break.

1234
01:18:13,859 --> 01:18:14,359
It's okay.

1235
01:18:16,949 --> 01:18:17,449
In break.

1236
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:21,920
God's wanted this to happen.

1237
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:25,520
Oh, thank you, Satan.

1238
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:42,279
Oh my God.

1239
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:45,720
Fuck.

1240
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:48,180
Not on me, motherfucker.

1241
01:18:48,180 --> 01:18:48,680
Not on me.

1242
01:18:50,180 --> 01:18:56,020
You fucking asshole.

1243
01:19:03,010 --> 01:19:04,289
Okay, that's active now.

1244
01:19:04,850 --> 01:19:06,689
Well, the red wire is now active.

1245
01:19:07,250 --> 01:19:08,770
This is a pain in the butt.

1246
01:19:13,989 --> 01:19:14,949
Red is now active.

1247
01:19:15,829 --> 01:19:17,270
I don't even power this shit on.

1248
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:20,300
And.

1249
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:24,100
Oh, wait.

1250
01:19:26,069 --> 01:19:27,109
I knew it.

1251
01:19:27,109 --> 01:19:27,829
I knew it.

1252
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:33,000
Why was this perfect opportunity to TV the fuck out of this guy?

1253
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:34,920
Hey, eat this.

1254
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:42,420
Break.

1255
01:19:48,770 --> 01:19:51,699
Fuck this TV.

1256
01:19:51,699 --> 01:19:52,579
It doesn't do anything.

1257
01:20:02,439 --> 01:20:03,319
Did green vent there?

1258
01:20:05,079 --> 01:20:08,159
I already made that.

1259
01:20:08,159 --> 01:20:09,600
I made that joke three days ago.

1260
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:10,079
I don't know.

1261
01:20:10,079 --> 01:20:24,920
How much health do I have?

1262
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:25,560
Not very much.

1263
01:20:26,119 --> 01:20:26,619
Wait.

1264
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:29,970
Isn't there a healing station over here?

1265
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:32,180
Fuck it.

1266
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:33,460
Take it.

1267
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,409
I want that grenade.

1268
01:20:35,409 --> 01:20:35,909
That's why.

1269
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:38,840
Okay, folks.

1270
01:20:40,199 --> 01:20:40,699
Let's go.

1271
01:20:47,699 --> 01:20:48,199
Fringy.

1272
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:52,420
Fringe.

1273
01:20:52,420 --> 01:20:52,800
Wait, what?

1274
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:53,359
What's going on?

1275
01:20:53,359 --> 01:20:54,960
Why is everybody saying fringy?

1276
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:55,760
The joke sucked.

1277
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:56,260
What joke?

1278
01:20:57,439 --> 01:20:58,399
Did I make a joke?

1279
01:20:58,399 --> 01:20:58,899
When?

1280
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:00,100
What'd I do?

1281
01:21:02,069 --> 01:21:03,510
Autumn minus two is before I.

1282
01:21:03,510 --> 01:21:04,010
What happened?

1283
01:21:08,130 --> 01:21:08,630
All of them?

1284
01:21:09,729 --> 01:21:10,229
All of them.

1285
01:21:11,590 --> 01:21:12,390
The lever?

1286
01:21:12,390 --> 01:21:12,890
Crack.

1287
01:21:13,350 --> 01:21:14,229
Career ending.

1288
01:21:14,229 --> 01:21:17,489
Play with being guy pig.

1289
01:21:17,489 --> 01:21:17,989
What?

1290
01:21:18,949 --> 01:21:19,590
Ban him.

1291
01:21:19,590 --> 01:21:20,229
Sell now.

1292
01:21:20,229 --> 01:21:21,029
Baste cringe.

1293
01:21:21,029 --> 01:21:22,069
I don't even know what's going on.

1294
01:21:22,069 --> 01:21:22,569
What did I do?

1295
01:21:26,159 --> 01:21:26,659
Hold on.

1296
01:21:27,569 --> 01:21:31,010
Me like playing with actually little figures and dolls on the counter

1297
01:21:31,569 --> 01:21:32,130
and being like,

1298
01:21:33,329 --> 01:21:36,609
is not as cringy as saying green vented.

1299
01:21:37,409 --> 01:21:40,640
I just want to be completely clear about this.

1300
01:21:41,359 --> 01:21:43,960
Correct.

1301
01:21:44,739 --> 01:21:45,300
Baste.

1302
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:45,800
Correct.

1303
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:46,300
Okay.

1304
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:46,800
Oh, all right.

1305
01:21:47,699 --> 01:21:48,420
I just want to be clear.

1306
01:21:48,979 --> 01:21:50,180
I just want to know what's going on.

1307
01:21:50,739 --> 01:21:57,279
All right, let's get out of here.

1308
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:00,000
Get out.

1309
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,039
Wait, can I draw on the walls?

1310
01:22:03,649 --> 01:22:04,850
Oh, come on.

1311
01:22:04,850 --> 01:22:07,329
I can't do like an elaborate painting.

1312
01:22:08,050 --> 01:22:08,850
That's unfortunate.

1313
01:22:09,489 --> 01:22:11,890
How do I get the fuck out of here?

1314
01:22:11,890 --> 01:22:14,449
How do I get out of here?

1315
01:22:14,449 --> 01:22:18,069
Close.

1316
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:27,079
Do I actually have to?

1317
01:22:27,079 --> 01:22:29,970
I don't.

1318
01:22:29,970 --> 01:22:30,369
I don't.

1319
01:22:30,369 --> 01:22:31,010
Do I really?

1320
01:22:31,010 --> 01:22:32,770
Do I have to open the door with this shit?

1321
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:36,880
I have to redirect the power again.

1322
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:37,680
No, dude.

1323
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:39,359
I don't want to redirect the power.

1324
01:22:44,630 --> 01:22:45,909
Wait, I turned it off, right?

1325
01:22:45,909 --> 01:22:47,189
So that doesn't matter anymore, does it?

1326
01:22:47,909 --> 01:22:49,800
Where are you going?

1327
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:56,390
It's okay.

1328
01:22:56,390 --> 01:22:57,270
I turned the power off.

1329
01:22:57,829 --> 01:22:59,510
I pulled the lever.

1330
01:22:59,510 --> 01:23:00,630
I just turned it off.

1331
01:23:01,189 --> 01:23:01,750
Yeah, we're good.

1332
01:23:01,750 --> 01:23:02,149
We're good.

1333
01:23:02,149 --> 01:23:02,470
We're good.

1334
01:23:02,470 --> 01:23:09,000
We're good.

1335
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:09,500
Baste.

1336
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:42,529
I want to jump over the fucking barrels.

1337
01:23:43,729 --> 01:23:51,319
I was wondering why.

1338
01:23:53,079 --> 01:23:58,489
Boom.

1339
01:23:59,670 --> 01:24:01,329
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

1340
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:04,680
Oh my God, that hurt.

1341
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:05,880
Oh my God, they're scary.

1342
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:08,600
Oh my God, it's loud and scary.

1343
01:24:13,079 --> 01:24:14,199
How did you even hit me?

1344
01:24:14,199 --> 01:24:15,319
Nice hit registry.

1345
01:24:17,329 --> 01:24:28,899
That's all you guys had.

1346
01:24:28,899 --> 01:24:30,899
Just one measly little clip.

1347
01:24:32,789 --> 01:24:33,750
I just threw up.

1348
01:24:33,750 --> 01:24:34,250
Whatever.

1349
01:24:34,789 --> 01:24:47,840
Where's the healing device?

1350
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:49,600
Isn't it right here somewhere?

1351
01:24:51,029 --> 01:24:52,470
There's a full heal somewhere.

1352
01:24:52,470 --> 01:24:53,430
I don't remember where it is.

1353
01:25:01,539 --> 01:25:02,100
Here it is.

1354
01:25:02,659 --> 01:25:03,539
I don't have a thing.

1355
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:07,109
No games.

1356
01:25:07,109 --> 01:25:07,909
I have a thing.

1357
01:25:08,630 --> 01:25:09,829
That looked so well.

1358
01:25:11,189 --> 01:25:12,550
Thank you, Valve.

1359
01:25:13,439 --> 01:25:14,159
Good devs.

1360
01:25:15,199 --> 01:25:15,920
Good devs.

1361
01:25:28,390 --> 01:25:33,199
Okay, come back and use it if I need to.

1362
01:25:33,199 --> 01:25:36,279
What are you doing on ammo?

1363
01:25:36,279 --> 01:25:36,760
Not bad.

1364
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:49,520
Good.

1365
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:51,880
Oh, eye's head right there.

1366
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:55,539
Ooh, good.

1367
01:25:55,539 --> 01:26:02,020
Imagine healing with the right hand.

1368
01:26:08,869 --> 01:26:10,149
Insert the next disc.

1369
01:26:11,590 --> 01:26:28,289
Loading in 2020.

1370
01:26:28,289 --> 01:26:29,810
It's a VR game.

1371
01:26:29,810 --> 01:26:30,930
You know how intense this shit is?

1372
01:26:35,170 --> 01:26:36,850
I'm actually surprised how much they're able to do

1373
01:26:36,850 --> 01:26:38,289
without a loading screen.

1374
01:26:38,289 --> 01:26:40,449
You guys have to remember most VR games

1375
01:26:41,409 --> 01:26:42,529
they're one room

1376
01:26:43,670 --> 01:26:46,149
that you just exist in for like an hour.

1377
01:26:47,029 --> 01:26:48,149
This is a full...

1378
01:26:48,149 --> 01:26:49,270
We're going down hallways.

1379
01:26:49,270 --> 01:26:50,550
We're opening doors.

1380
01:26:50,550 --> 01:26:51,029
This...

1381
01:26:51,029 --> 01:26:52,470
Most VR games don't do this.

1382
01:26:54,770 --> 01:26:55,329
One room.

1383
01:26:55,970 --> 01:27:04,069
Still fun.

1384
01:27:04,710 --> 01:27:06,039
Anything on you?

1385
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:07,479
Don't do it.

1386
01:27:07,479 --> 01:27:08,279
It's not even worth it.

1387
01:27:08,279 --> 01:27:09,159
It's wasting ammo.

1388
01:27:15,989 --> 01:27:16,470
Cool.

1389
01:27:16,470 --> 01:27:18,050
All right, let's go.

1390
01:27:19,189 --> 01:27:19,750
After 10.

1391
01:27:20,550 --> 01:27:21,649
Attack of the Clones.

1392
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:32,930
Good luck trying to lock out someone wielding an Alex.

1393
01:27:33,569 --> 01:27:34,250
Oh.

1394
01:27:34,810 --> 01:27:37,020
That's the gorilla.

1395
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:37,659
Don't say that.

1396
01:27:39,020 --> 01:27:40,380
I'm inclined to believe you.

1397
01:27:41,100 --> 01:27:52,970
Oh, shit.

1398
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:55,800
Whoa, Russell.

1399
01:27:56,840 --> 01:27:57,560
Oh, they got it.

1400
01:27:57,560 --> 01:27:58,520
Substation.

1401
01:27:58,520 --> 01:27:59,239
Oh, that's it.

1402
01:28:00,199 --> 01:28:01,239
Oh, it's coming down.

1403
01:28:01,239 --> 01:28:02,600
Come down to our substation.

1404
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:03,560
Break this down, Alex.

1405
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:04,439
It's gonna come down.

1406
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:07,909
I can't check.

1407
01:28:08,470 --> 01:28:19,739
Rats.

1408
01:28:19,739 --> 01:28:20,220
We're rats.

1409
01:28:20,220 --> 01:28:20,859
So where's those beams?

1410
01:28:20,859 --> 01:28:21,739
We're the rats.

1411
01:28:21,739 --> 01:28:22,220
You see that?

1412
01:28:22,220 --> 01:28:23,180
That's gotta be the backup station.

1413
01:28:28,229 --> 01:28:29,430
What's that, Alex?

1414
01:28:29,430 --> 01:28:29,930
Nothing.

1415
01:28:30,630 --> 01:28:31,189
I'm on my way.

1416
01:28:32,149 --> 01:28:32,649
Okay.

1417
01:28:33,430 --> 01:28:33,930
Uh.

1418
01:28:38,100 --> 01:28:38,659
Oh.

1419
01:28:38,659 --> 01:28:39,699
Did I press this button?

1420
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:52,090
Welcome, all of you, to the Hunger Games.

1421
01:28:52,970 --> 01:28:55,369
I'm President Davidson.

1422
01:28:56,659 --> 01:28:57,159
Tonight.

1423
01:28:57,859 --> 01:29:00,550
You've never seen this movie before,

1424
01:29:00,550 --> 01:29:02,630
but you just think this is how it started.

1425
01:29:03,670 --> 01:29:06,229
You imagine this is how that movie starts.

1426
01:29:06,229 --> 01:29:07,109
You haven't read the books.

1427
01:29:07,109 --> 01:29:08,869
You haven't seen any media of it.

1428
01:29:08,869 --> 01:29:11,430
You've just seen on the side of buses

1429
01:29:12,229 --> 01:29:14,630
Katniss going like this with a bow and arrow.

1430
01:29:14,630 --> 01:29:16,149
This is how it starts.

1431
01:29:16,149 --> 01:29:17,909
And all the subjects are down there.

1432
01:29:18,710 --> 01:29:20,920
And you know the name.

1433
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:24,710
Davidson, huh?

1434
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:29,880
You did, Mike.

1435
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:33,180
All right, this is gonna be a fight here.

1436
01:29:39,460 --> 01:29:40,180
I'm asking you guys.

1437
01:29:44,890 --> 01:29:47,210
Well, um, this is the time to use this shit.

1438
01:29:47,210 --> 01:29:47,770
Don't you think?

1439
01:29:47,770 --> 01:29:49,130
No, I think so, folks.

1440
01:29:50,090 --> 01:29:55,180
Oh, Mike.

1441
01:29:55,180 --> 01:29:56,140
That's a lot of people.

1442
01:29:56,779 --> 01:30:02,180
Holy shit, he's coming.

1443
01:30:02,180 --> 01:30:10,119
Oh, shit.

1444
01:30:10,119 --> 01:30:10,619
That's heavy.

1445
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:16,890
Tonight.

1446
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:45,800
Last push.

1447
01:31:03,449 --> 01:31:05,399
Shelf.

1448
01:31:05,939 --> 01:31:07,380
I thought it was the shelf.

1449
01:31:07,380 --> 01:31:07,859
It's you.

1450
01:31:08,659 --> 01:31:09,220
I'm sorry.

1451
01:31:09,220 --> 01:31:10,100
It was you guys.

1452
01:31:10,899 --> 01:31:12,659
I just backed up in the desk.

1453
01:31:13,539 --> 01:31:14,489
Okay, I'm ready.

1454
01:31:15,590 --> 01:31:16,390
Everything's loaded.

1455
01:31:16,390 --> 01:31:17,189
Everything's primed.

1456
01:31:17,189 --> 01:31:18,229
Everything's ready to shoot.

1457
01:31:18,229 --> 01:31:19,670
Everything's got plenty of bullets.

1458
01:31:19,670 --> 01:31:20,390
Let's move on.

1459
01:31:34,840 --> 01:31:41,149
Thank you.

1460
01:31:41,850 --> 01:31:52,310
Thanks, dude.

1461
01:31:52,310 --> 01:31:52,869
I appreciate it.

1462
01:31:53,510 --> 01:31:55,750
Appreciate you, man.

1463
01:31:55,750 --> 01:31:56,869
Appreciate you.

1464
01:31:56,869 --> 01:31:57,590
Hey, okay.

1465
01:31:58,550 --> 01:32:02,069
This is just because I leave a two-star review.

1466
01:32:02,069 --> 01:32:02,710
I'm sorry.

1467
01:32:03,670 --> 01:32:06,859
Is this because of the 10% tip?

1468
01:32:06,859 --> 01:32:07,500
Oh, shit.

1469
01:32:08,619 --> 01:32:26,420
10%.

1470
01:32:27,939 --> 01:32:35,850
Don't ever make your head.

1471
01:32:35,850 --> 01:32:38,170
If you're going to shoot for the king, don't miss.

1472
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:55,100
Miss.

1473
01:32:55,720 --> 01:33:03,130
If you're going to go for the king, make sure you, uh,

1474
01:33:03,930 --> 01:33:06,010
fill him with like 20 bullet holes and not eight.

1475
01:33:06,810 --> 01:33:08,390
That's how I'm going to be alive.

1476
01:33:09,109 --> 01:33:12,869
I need help.

1477
01:33:13,510 --> 01:33:17,140
Hey, fellas.

1478
01:33:17,859 --> 01:33:23,100
Back up there.

1479
01:33:23,100 --> 01:33:23,739
Never mind.

1480
01:33:23,739 --> 01:33:31,210
Everybody needs to practice in DM servers.

1481
01:33:33,100 --> 01:33:34,779
I just did fine.

1482
01:33:34,859 --> 01:33:37,020
I just defied like 10, 20 enemies at the same time.

1483
01:33:39,699 --> 01:33:42,420
Looking for like health pack or something of some sort.

1484
01:33:42,420 --> 01:33:43,060
Why is that open?

1485
01:33:43,859 --> 01:33:54,090
Health pack.

1486
01:33:54,819 --> 01:33:55,460
Something.

1487
01:33:55,460 --> 01:33:57,220
I can feel my heart pulsing here.

1488
01:34:06,069 --> 01:34:09,109
DM instant respawn 24-7.

1489
01:34:09,829 --> 01:34:14,010
You know what's bad about 24-7 servers is you'll get in there and there's no map change.

1490
01:34:14,010 --> 01:34:16,090
The timer is at like 16 hours.

1491
01:34:16,729 --> 01:34:18,250
You know, you look up at the clock.

1492
01:34:18,250 --> 01:34:21,930
It's like, oh, yeah, there's like 845 minutes left.

1493
01:34:22,489 --> 01:34:23,130
Okay.

1494
01:34:23,130 --> 01:34:25,130
And you get trapped in there and you can't leave.

1495
01:34:27,130 --> 01:34:28,890
You look at the clock after like six hours.

1496
01:34:28,890 --> 01:34:31,369
You've been in the same map, shooting the same people.

1497
01:34:32,890 --> 01:34:35,210
You can't, it's like being in a casino.

1498
01:34:35,210 --> 01:34:36,890
There's no clocks in a casino.

1499
01:34:36,890 --> 01:34:38,090
You're just stuck at the slot machine.

1500
01:34:38,090 --> 01:34:38,810
You don't even know where you are.

1501
01:34:39,930 --> 01:34:41,430
That's why I don't like to play those.

1502
01:34:42,699 --> 01:34:45,180
Just your mouth just stays open and you're just like, oh, right.

1503
01:34:46,060 --> 01:34:50,859
I used to drink a 12 pack of Code Red Mountain Dew every other day.

1504
01:34:50,859 --> 01:34:51,899
Just sitting there doing that.

1505
01:34:52,779 --> 01:34:56,380
On original Team Fortress Classic, I forget what the map was,

1506
01:34:56,380 --> 01:34:57,340
but there was a map where you could go.

1507
01:34:57,340 --> 01:34:58,380
It was, I think it was well.

1508
01:34:58,939 --> 01:35:00,699
I would play well like every day.

1509
01:35:00,699 --> 01:35:01,500
The original well.

1510
01:35:02,460 --> 01:35:06,199
I don't like the casino.

1511
01:35:06,199 --> 01:35:07,079
There's somebody up there.

1512
01:35:07,079 --> 01:35:09,100
That's not a combine.

1513
01:35:09,100 --> 01:35:10,060
Maybe a scavenger?

1514
01:35:10,619 --> 01:35:11,420
Be careful.

1515
01:35:11,420 --> 01:35:13,029
Oh, don't throw a grenade in there.

1516
01:35:13,029 --> 01:35:13,430
I need that.

1517
01:35:14,069 --> 01:35:24,500
Just throw this out.

1518
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:27,989
I'll take it.

1519
01:35:32,739 --> 01:35:49,619
Oh, any of you guys that have ever lived underneath somebody in an apartment building?

1520
01:35:51,140 --> 01:35:53,800
You got to listen to this fucking TV every day.

1521
01:35:55,239 --> 01:35:57,560
Okay.

1522
01:35:57,560 --> 01:36:00,039
Do you really have to have the TV at 10 volume?

1523
01:36:00,039 --> 01:36:01,800
You can't do it at like seven or eight.

1524
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:04,279
Where are you in your house that you have to have the TV that loud?

1525
01:36:04,279 --> 01:36:04,920
I never got that.

1526
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:06,039
I never fucking understood that.

1527
01:36:08,470 --> 01:36:11,909
Are you in the bathroom with the door closed with the TV at max volume,

1528
01:36:11,909 --> 01:36:15,189
trying to listen to whatever's on the TV 10 rooms down in your house?

1529
01:36:15,189 --> 01:36:15,750
I don't understand.

1530
01:36:15,750 --> 01:36:16,470
Why do people do that?

1531
01:36:19,029 --> 01:36:19,510
Good joke.

1532
01:36:19,510 --> 01:36:20,229
I'm not making a joke.

1533
01:36:20,229 --> 01:36:20,949
This sucks.

1534
01:36:20,949 --> 01:36:21,829
Don't do this to people.

1535
01:36:33,779 --> 01:36:35,300
I'm just getting like flashbacks.

1536
01:36:36,260 --> 01:36:37,220
No.

1537
01:36:37,220 --> 01:36:42,149
Wait, I am my own supervisor?

1538
01:36:44,810 --> 01:36:49,399
I am my own supervisor.

1539
01:36:49,399 --> 01:36:49,720
Okay.

1540
01:36:50,600 --> 01:36:59,579
Is it going up?

1541
01:36:59,579 --> 01:37:10,039
Were we about to like sneak into this lady's place or something?

1542
01:37:10,039 --> 01:37:12,579
What am I doing here?

1543
01:37:12,579 --> 01:37:13,140
Where should I go?

1544
01:37:16,949 --> 01:37:17,590
Wall dad.

1545
01:37:19,510 --> 01:37:20,310
What's she listening to?

1546
01:37:21,270 --> 01:37:22,069
I wonder what that is.

1547
01:37:22,869 --> 01:37:24,199
We used to love this show.

1548
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:36,600
Wait.

1549
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:42,920
Finally, we need to move the box or this thing is going to be black Mesa all over again.

1550
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:45,380
Black Mesa.

1551
01:37:45,380 --> 01:37:48,180
Well, now I'm telling you it is black Mesa.

1552
01:37:48,180 --> 01:37:48,739
Oh shit.

1553
01:37:48,739 --> 01:37:49,779
It's one of those worms.

1554
01:37:49,779 --> 01:37:51,060
When she gets there, he's gone.

1555
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:57,159
What in the history of today makes you think it is Elmer?

1556
01:37:57,159 --> 01:38:01,159
But this guy who got in there survived black Mesa.

1557
01:38:01,159 --> 01:38:03,880
He raised holy hell and then just disappeared.

1558
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:06,520
We finally caught him and you're just going to let him go again?

1559
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:10,899
Talking about Gordon Freeman.

1560
01:38:10,899 --> 01:38:15,689
Survived black Mesa for weapons.

1561
01:38:15,689 --> 01:38:16,649
God damn it, Rusty.

1562
01:38:16,649 --> 01:38:18,439
Gordon Freeman.

1563
01:38:18,439 --> 01:38:19,510
Wow.

1564
01:38:19,510 --> 01:38:20,710
That's good, right?

1565
01:38:20,710 --> 01:38:24,890
This is sick.

1566
01:38:24,890 --> 01:38:25,770
All right.

1567
01:38:25,770 --> 01:38:28,489
So let's go save Gordon Freeman.

1568
01:38:28,489 --> 01:38:29,930
Wait, we have to save Gordon Freeman?

1569
01:38:30,890 --> 01:38:33,239
Incoming.

1570
01:38:33,239 --> 01:38:34,039
Hey, give me a second.

1571
01:38:58,489 --> 01:38:59,770
Thanks for the exit, idiot.

1572
01:39:00,729 --> 01:39:06,260
Still there?

1573
01:39:06,260 --> 01:39:07,779
No, I'm not.

1574
01:39:08,500 --> 01:39:18,250
Grenade room.

1575
01:39:19,529 --> 01:39:22,090
Look, I figured out that you have to blow up the wall.

1576
01:39:22,810 --> 01:39:23,529
I had to do that.

1577
01:39:23,529 --> 01:39:24,409
I just was too slow.

1578
01:39:27,130 --> 01:39:28,170
It's Gordon.

1579
01:39:28,170 --> 01:39:28,729
Holy shit.

1580
01:39:28,729 --> 01:39:30,090
It's Gordon Freeman.

1581
01:39:30,810 --> 01:39:35,109
I can't wait till the last frame of this game.

1582
01:39:36,140 --> 01:39:38,699
Is you're in a room and all of a sudden you see we're going to be the start

1583
01:39:38,699 --> 01:39:39,500
of Half-Life 2.

1584
01:39:40,060 --> 01:39:41,979
Gordon Freeman, we're going to be in that room in the very beginning.

1585
01:39:41,979 --> 01:39:44,859
Gordon Freeman, we're going to be like hiding behind a fucking barrel

1586
01:39:44,859 --> 01:39:46,859
and we're going to look up and see the start of Half-Life 2

1587
01:39:46,859 --> 01:39:48,300
and he's going to look right back in the camera.

1588
01:39:49,020 --> 01:39:51,739
You know, he's going to be like, and then he's going to keep walking

1589
01:39:51,739 --> 01:39:53,979
and right that first beginning, he's going to pick up that can, right?

1590
01:39:53,979 --> 01:39:54,619
That's going to happen.

1591
01:39:55,909 --> 01:39:57,350
Let's go save Gordon Freeman.

1592
01:39:58,149 --> 01:39:59,109
It's going to be seamless.

1593
01:39:59,750 --> 01:40:02,739
Hey, give me a second.

1594
01:40:02,739 --> 01:40:03,380
All right, incoming.

1595
01:40:04,180 --> 01:40:20,069
All right, blow it up.

1596
01:40:20,630 --> 01:40:21,510
Blow it up and blow it.

1597
01:40:22,229 --> 01:40:24,500
Where am I?

1598
01:40:26,359 --> 01:40:27,960
And action.

1599
01:40:28,920 --> 01:40:38,680
What?

1600
01:40:39,399 --> 01:40:39,880
What happened?

1601
01:40:39,880 --> 01:40:40,760
I stubbed my toe.

1602
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:44,149
Why did that happen?

1603
01:40:44,789 --> 01:40:46,659
Hey, there was a...

1604
01:40:47,859 --> 01:40:48,100
What?

1605
01:40:54,729 --> 01:40:55,930
I didn't jump the gap.

1606
01:40:57,130 --> 01:40:58,890
I didn't know there was a gap to jump.

1607
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:12,359
Let's go save Gordon Freeman.

1608
01:41:12,359 --> 01:41:12,920
All right, just go.

1609
01:41:12,920 --> 01:41:13,960
I'm in here.

1610
01:41:13,960 --> 01:41:14,920
Hello, I'm in here.

1611
01:41:15,640 --> 01:41:16,119
Incoming.

1612
01:41:16,939 --> 01:41:17,819
Hey, give me a second.

1613
01:41:20,060 --> 01:41:21,180
I'm just blowing it.

1614
01:41:21,819 --> 01:41:22,779
I don't fucking care.

1615
01:41:24,220 --> 01:41:27,050
Let's go.

1616
01:41:27,050 --> 01:41:57,720
Okay.

1617
01:41:58,869 --> 01:42:01,510
So this little chimney right here.

1618
01:42:01,510 --> 01:42:02,470
Come on, really?

1619
01:42:03,829 --> 01:42:06,949
Okay, so the plan is to get to that control room and get Gordon.

1620
01:42:06,949 --> 01:42:11,720
And as people talk about him a lot, but I always just assumed he was dead.

1621
01:42:11,720 --> 01:42:12,680
Me too.

1622
01:42:12,680 --> 01:42:14,840
Hey, Dad, are you there?

1623
01:42:14,840 --> 01:42:15,880
Yeah, what's up, Alex?

1624
01:42:16,439 --> 01:42:20,279
If Gordon survived Black Mesa, where has he been?

1625
01:42:20,840 --> 01:42:25,420
I don't know.

1626
01:42:25,420 --> 01:42:26,619
Who were they talking about?

1627
01:42:26,619 --> 01:42:27,739
Wow, did you just...

1628
01:42:27,739 --> 01:42:29,020
Who, Gordon Freeman?

1629
01:42:29,659 --> 01:42:30,699
I didn't play Half-Life.

1630
01:42:30,699 --> 01:42:31,659
This is a new VR game.

1631
01:42:31,659 --> 01:42:32,779
It came out, like, sorry.

1632
01:42:32,779 --> 01:42:36,060
Blame me for, like, them not making a new iteration for 12 years.

1633
01:42:37,180 --> 01:42:37,979
I don't know who that is.

1634
01:42:37,979 --> 01:42:39,500
I just bought a new VR game.

1635
01:42:39,500 --> 01:42:40,060
What the fuck?

1636
01:42:46,140 --> 01:42:46,859
Pig fan.

1637
01:42:52,310 --> 01:42:53,750
No, I need a silencer.

1638
01:42:54,920 --> 01:42:55,640
What shall do?

1639
01:42:57,380 --> 01:42:59,060
I need to actually use this.

1640
01:42:59,060 --> 01:43:21,000
Okay, okay, okay.

1641
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:22,119
Okay.

1642
01:43:23,460 --> 01:43:24,420
Do what I like to watch.

1643
01:43:26,180 --> 01:43:27,939
Ow, oh, yes.

1644
01:43:27,939 --> 01:43:28,439
Ow.

1645
01:43:29,300 --> 01:43:34,229
Can I get in there?

1646
01:43:44,840 --> 01:43:46,119
Oh, yeah, wait, can I get in there?

1647
01:43:48,359 --> 01:43:55,689
I say you got it.

1648
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,800
Okay, I thought that was one of those explosive tripwires.

1649
01:44:03,800 --> 01:44:26,220
Can I jump on there?

1650
01:44:26,220 --> 01:44:31,340
Actually, I might be able to glitch that.

1651
01:44:33,100 --> 01:44:36,100
That's really possible.

1652
01:44:38,119 --> 01:44:39,479
There's a box up there.

1653
01:44:48,789 --> 01:44:54,149
Is that a box?

1654
01:44:56,310 --> 01:44:57,930
Not a grenade.

1655
01:45:00,069 --> 01:45:00,390
All right.

1656
01:45:01,340 --> 01:45:05,020
Oh, by the way, those of you that are wondering why I have to always put it in my right hand.

1657
01:45:05,739 --> 01:45:09,739
My left hand hitting that top button and holding the trigger at the same time,

1658
01:45:10,460 --> 01:45:10,939
I can't do it.

1659
01:45:10,939 --> 01:45:11,739
My fingers can't do it.

1660
01:45:11,739 --> 01:45:12,060
It hurts.

1661
01:45:13,180 --> 01:45:15,020
Like, I physically can't do it.

1662
01:45:15,819 --> 01:45:17,479
I always end up dropping it.

1663
01:45:18,119 --> 01:45:29,260
Electricity mini game coming up.

1664
01:45:30,300 --> 01:45:31,100
Nothing under this.

1665
01:45:53,460 --> 01:45:59,189
I know, I get it, man.

1666
01:45:59,909 --> 01:46:00,869
Do it to you too.

1667
01:46:01,590 --> 01:46:04,470
Oh my god, I fell.

1668
01:46:17,460 --> 01:46:28,520
All right.

1669
01:46:28,600 --> 01:46:29,560
I don't think I can do that.

1670
01:46:35,720 --> 01:46:37,159
What do you think they're doing in here?

1671
01:46:37,880 --> 01:46:41,079
Looks like they're moking the leggies.

1672
01:46:41,079 --> 01:46:53,770
What the hell are they doing that?

1673
01:46:54,569 --> 01:47:05,029
Are they jumping too?

1674
01:47:08,739 --> 01:47:09,779
Almost got it.

1675
01:47:09,779 --> 01:47:10,180
Almost.

1676
01:47:29,510 --> 01:47:36,819
Where do I go?

1677
01:47:37,779 --> 01:47:38,659
I can't go down there.

1678
01:47:39,460 --> 01:47:48,409
Wait a minute.

1679
01:47:48,409 --> 01:47:49,130
Why up here?

1680
01:47:53,979 --> 01:47:54,699
This is weird, right?

1681
01:47:54,699 --> 01:47:55,500
What am I doing over here?

1682
01:47:56,220 --> 01:47:58,340
Why am I removing these?

1683
01:47:59,140 --> 01:48:05,590
Nothing, actually.

1684
01:48:06,310 --> 01:48:07,210
I fall?

1685
01:48:07,210 --> 01:48:08,890
I'm so scared of falling down a gap.

1686
01:48:09,689 --> 01:48:10,500
I don't go down?

1687
01:48:12,539 --> 01:48:13,260
I don't know if I should.

1688
01:48:13,260 --> 01:48:13,819
I don't know if I should.

1689
01:48:13,819 --> 01:48:14,779
I die when I fall.

1690
01:48:15,420 --> 01:48:20,090
That happens.

1691
01:48:20,090 --> 01:48:20,649
Fall joke.

1692
01:48:20,649 --> 01:48:21,130
Fall joke.

1693
01:48:21,130 --> 01:48:22,250
Stop pretending.

1694
01:48:22,250 --> 01:48:22,569
I don't...

1695
01:48:23,369 --> 01:48:23,689
I don't...

1696
01:48:26,260 --> 01:48:26,500
Okay.

1697
01:48:27,539 --> 01:48:29,300
Every time I've ever done something like this, I've died.

1698
01:48:30,260 --> 01:48:35,909
Hey, you stop pretending.

1699
01:48:36,550 --> 01:48:37,270
To pretend...

1700
01:48:37,909 --> 01:48:39,430
To tell me that I'm pretending.

1701
01:48:45,510 --> 01:48:46,550
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1702
01:48:49,850 --> 01:48:50,489
Shit, buddy.

1703
01:48:51,210 --> 01:49:00,329
Not again, can't I?

1704
01:49:00,970 --> 01:49:01,529
My eyes!

1705
01:49:09,800 --> 01:49:11,239
That was fucking scary.

1706
01:49:12,199 --> 01:49:13,000
Right in the eyes.

1707
01:49:22,840 --> 01:49:24,039
This game's really fun.

1708
01:49:25,369 --> 01:49:26,489
This is one of the good ones.

1709
01:49:31,210 --> 01:49:32,010
Oh, no.

1710
01:49:32,010 --> 01:49:34,010
Can I get in there and open this from the other side?

1711
01:49:34,010 --> 01:49:34,729
Can I get in there?

1712
01:49:36,569 --> 01:49:37,210
Yes, I can.

1713
01:49:37,930 --> 01:49:48,279
Hey, cop, kiss.

1714
01:49:57,699 --> 01:50:04,170
Now what?

1715
01:50:04,170 --> 01:50:05,130
Now what?

1716
01:50:05,130 --> 01:50:05,850
Somebody tell me.

1717
01:50:06,729 --> 01:50:07,210
Oh, right there.

1718
01:50:11,350 --> 01:50:23,899
That's not gonna crush me, right?

1719
01:50:36,569 --> 01:50:37,850
Get down here again, please.

1720
01:50:38,489 --> 01:50:44,600
We're gonna get in the toilet and it's gonna bring us up.

1721
01:50:45,159 --> 01:50:56,359
If we get Gordon back, we can really get a vicious.

1722
01:50:56,359 --> 01:50:57,079
Don't you think, Russ?

1723
01:50:57,800 --> 01:51:00,310
Maybe we can take him and split it up.

1724
01:51:00,310 --> 01:51:01,989
Well, he saved humanity once.

1725
01:51:01,989 --> 01:51:04,310
No!

1726
01:51:04,310 --> 01:51:05,829
And this time, he won't have to do it alone.

1727
01:51:10,199 --> 01:51:10,699
No!

1728
01:51:11,319 --> 01:51:11,819
No!

1729
01:51:27,369 --> 01:51:28,329
She knows, too.

1730
01:51:29,130 --> 01:51:57,060
Oh, for the explosives.

1731
01:52:04,149 --> 01:52:05,029
Can I kick this down?

1732
01:52:09,109 --> 01:52:14,069
I can't, like, like in that game that everybody preferences, including me.

1733
01:52:14,069 --> 01:52:16,069
Every single time I play any video game.

1734
01:52:16,949 --> 01:52:18,270
It's not.

1735
01:52:20,229 --> 01:52:21,189
I'll take the free heal.

1736
01:52:23,699 --> 01:52:24,199
Not yet.

1737
01:52:30,180 --> 01:52:38,229
Okay, bugleberry.

1738
01:52:46,659 --> 01:52:47,159
Fuck.

1739
01:53:04,310 --> 01:53:19,829
Oh, shit.

1740
01:53:19,829 --> 01:53:20,390
Oh, shit.

1741
01:53:20,390 --> 01:53:20,869
Oh, shit.

1742
01:53:20,869 --> 01:53:21,670
Oh, shit.

1743
01:53:21,670 --> 01:53:22,310
Oh, shit.

1744
01:53:23,270 --> 01:53:23,909
Oh, shit.

1745
01:53:23,909 --> 01:53:24,949
There's a guy.

1746
01:53:24,949 --> 01:53:25,430
Hold on.

1747
01:53:25,430 --> 01:53:26,390
Take care of this guy first.

1748
01:53:28,789 --> 01:53:29,289
Okay.

1749
01:53:29,829 --> 01:53:31,989
Now, give me that.

1750
01:53:31,989 --> 01:53:32,550
Where'd that go?

1751
01:53:35,189 --> 01:53:35,689
Okay.

1752
01:53:35,750 --> 01:53:36,250
Come here.

1753
01:53:40,229 --> 01:53:42,949
I'm so afraid of this smash into the Reddit shelf.

1754
01:53:42,949 --> 01:53:43,510
Where am I?

1755
01:53:43,510 --> 01:53:44,069
Okay, I got it.

1756
01:54:31,289 --> 01:54:35,369
Russ, what do you think they're doing to Gordon Freeman in there?

1757
01:54:35,369 --> 01:54:36,170
That's a good question.

1758
01:54:36,729 --> 01:54:38,859
Are they, you know,

1759
01:54:40,300 --> 01:54:41,500
sucking his brain out?

1760
01:54:41,500 --> 01:54:42,000
Hey, Bits.

1761
01:54:43,500 --> 01:54:44,140
Hey, Bits.

1762
01:54:44,140 --> 01:54:45,659
I don't know who they were.

1763
01:54:45,659 --> 01:54:45,979
Thank you.

1764
01:54:45,979 --> 01:54:47,979
Whoever gave you a bunch of money.

1765
01:54:47,979 --> 01:54:48,479
Thank you.

1766
01:54:49,880 --> 01:54:50,380
Thank you.

1767
01:55:04,229 --> 01:55:05,109
Handgun Harry.

1768
01:55:05,670 --> 01:55:16,489
I like the handgun.

1769
01:55:16,489 --> 01:55:17,289
It's like my favorite weapon.

1770
01:55:23,529 --> 01:55:25,369
I have 56 of these.

1771
01:55:25,369 --> 01:55:27,289
I have 56 resin.

1772
01:55:28,409 --> 01:55:29,130
Oh, my goodness.

1773
01:55:29,130 --> 01:55:30,329
I can do a lot of stuff now.

1774
01:55:31,130 --> 01:55:32,069
I don't know.

1775
01:55:32,069 --> 01:55:32,869
What should I do, though?

1776
01:55:33,590 --> 01:55:41,449
Look at that.

1777
01:55:41,449 --> 01:55:44,310
That's not fair.

1778
01:55:45,029 --> 01:55:49,159
That's not fair.

1779
01:55:49,159 --> 01:55:49,800
How do you get that?

1780
01:55:50,359 --> 01:55:56,710
Probably get it later.

1781
01:56:00,539 --> 01:56:01,720
Does it hurt?

1782
01:56:04,600 --> 01:56:23,880
Um, do this.

1783
01:56:24,920 --> 01:56:27,140
Rick, do the joke.

1784
01:56:29,770 --> 01:56:37,500
Oh, I know what to do.

1785
01:56:38,460 --> 01:56:48,569
Thor, good for you.

1786
01:56:50,060 --> 01:56:50,699
Smart guy.

1787
01:56:51,819 --> 01:56:52,699
Hey, smarty.

1788
01:56:53,500 --> 01:56:54,699
Smart guy here.

1789
01:56:55,420 --> 01:57:08,340
Come up here, then.

1790
01:57:08,899 --> 01:57:16,649
Not even that scary when you know you can deal with it with a shotgun blast with Jeff.

1791
01:57:17,449 --> 01:57:28,300
Get back here.

1792
01:57:28,859 --> 01:57:31,350
Wait, what happened to him?

1793
01:57:31,350 --> 01:57:35,189
Russ, what's the deal with the throw bar?

1794
01:57:35,189 --> 01:57:37,750
Oh, you mean Gordon Freeman's throw bar?

1795
01:57:37,750 --> 01:57:38,250
Yeah.

1796
01:57:38,869 --> 01:57:42,550
Alex, he fought his way out of Black Mesa with nothing but that crowbar.

1797
01:57:42,550 --> 01:57:45,380
True.

1798
01:57:45,380 --> 01:57:47,140
Well, it's true that that's what they say.

1799
01:57:47,140 --> 01:57:48,500
You know, nobody knows for sure.

1800
01:57:48,500 --> 01:57:50,180
Gordon Freeman's crowbar.

1801
01:57:50,180 --> 01:57:52,739
Well, when I get him out, let's give him a gun.

1802
01:57:52,739 --> 01:57:55,670
Yes, but not much.

1803
01:57:55,670 --> 01:57:56,630
Dude, I can't wait for...

1804
01:58:08,100 --> 01:58:12,460
Upgrade station.

1805
01:58:13,180 --> 01:58:16,500
Is that a queen?

1806
01:58:17,380 --> 01:58:20,840
That's fucked up.

1807
01:58:21,800 --> 01:58:22,939
Crazy.

1808
01:58:22,939 --> 01:58:28,760
What am I going to do?

1809
01:58:28,760 --> 01:58:30,199
Should I do more upgrades?

1810
01:58:30,199 --> 01:58:42,460
Should I do a grenade launcher?

1811
01:58:43,420 --> 01:58:44,619
Oh, I don't know, but this is...

1812
01:58:45,420 --> 01:58:50,020
I don't want to do this.

1813
01:58:50,020 --> 01:58:55,670
I'm only doing this because I'm live.

1814
01:58:55,670 --> 01:58:57,670
If I wasn't live, I would have taken a break here.

1815
01:58:57,670 --> 01:59:14,380
I don't fucking do this sometimes.

1816
01:59:14,380 --> 01:59:15,340
String joker.

1817
01:59:16,520 --> 01:59:17,720
Okay, let's see here.

1818
01:59:17,720 --> 01:59:18,439
I want to take a look.

1819
01:59:18,439 --> 01:59:19,720
I got a lot of rest.

1820
01:59:19,720 --> 01:59:26,460
Probably one of the final upgrades I'll do in the future.

1821
01:59:26,460 --> 01:59:27,579
Burst fire.

1822
01:59:27,579 --> 01:59:28,300
Oh, don't need it.

1823
01:59:30,699 --> 01:59:31,199
Okay.

1824
01:59:31,979 --> 01:59:33,850
Aid launcher.

1825
01:59:33,850 --> 01:59:34,810
Auto loader?

1826
01:59:35,609 --> 01:59:44,380
Aid launcher.

1827
01:59:44,380 --> 01:59:45,579
Auto loader sounds really good.

1828
01:59:49,449 --> 01:59:50,649
What about my favorite gun?

1829
01:59:52,600 --> 01:59:57,720
The common fire.

1830
01:59:57,720 --> 02:00:15,979
Although, it's because I always have no place to put grenades.

1831
02:00:16,939 --> 02:00:17,439
Oh.

1832
02:00:18,140 --> 02:00:20,279
Potentially it's going to store them, right?

1833
02:00:21,079 --> 02:00:25,109
I can put it on a resin.

1834
02:00:25,109 --> 02:00:27,510
This is like six hours worth of resin.

1835
02:00:38,659 --> 02:00:40,100
Auto loader is new.

1836
02:00:43,399 --> 02:00:44,520
Oh, that should come in handy.

1837
02:00:44,520 --> 02:00:45,159
Oh, shit.

1838
02:00:45,159 --> 02:00:47,800
Push handle forward to ready grenade launcher?

1839
02:00:48,439 --> 02:00:50,359
Or fire to attack normally?

1840
02:00:51,560 --> 02:00:53,510
Oh, shit.

1841
02:00:54,390 --> 02:00:55,989
Press to launch grenade

1842
02:00:55,989 --> 02:00:57,989
or grab grenade to reset launcher.

1843
02:01:02,409 --> 02:01:03,369
That's the grenade.

1844
02:01:03,369 --> 02:01:04,970
That's not grenade.

1845
02:01:05,850 --> 02:01:10,329
Okay, it's ready.

1846
02:01:10,329 --> 02:01:12,250
That kind of looks dumb though, doesn't it?

1847
02:01:12,970 --> 02:01:14,340
This is like ugly.

1848
02:01:14,340 --> 02:01:15,300
All right, what else can I do?

1849
02:01:15,939 --> 02:01:23,079
How much is the laser sight for this?

1850
02:01:24,520 --> 02:01:26,949
Reflex is 15.

1851
02:01:26,949 --> 02:01:27,829
I'll wait for 25.

1852
02:01:27,829 --> 02:01:28,630
I want the laser sight.

1853
02:01:29,270 --> 02:01:35,640
Put it up.

1854
02:01:43,609 --> 02:01:44,970
I got my upgrade.

1855
02:01:45,930 --> 02:01:58,680
I'll store it because I don't need it.

1856
02:01:59,399 --> 02:02:11,909
Oh, people, people, people.

1857
02:02:12,710 --> 02:02:15,659
Is this in the same universe as the movie WALL-E?

1858
02:02:20,340 --> 02:02:21,380
Imagine if that was true.

1859
02:02:23,800 --> 02:02:24,199
Could be.

1860
02:02:24,920 --> 02:02:27,590
It's got the same color scheme as WALL-E.

1861
02:02:27,590 --> 02:02:29,750
It's blue, gray, and white.

1862
02:02:29,750 --> 02:02:31,590
That whole movie is blue, gray, and white.

1863
02:02:31,590 --> 02:02:32,630
So I see what you mean by that.

1864
02:02:38,140 --> 02:02:42,550
Oh, okay.

1865
02:02:42,550 --> 02:02:43,029
All right.

1866
02:02:43,029 --> 02:02:44,310
I activated the fight.

1867
02:02:45,029 --> 02:02:52,439
I got to go down, don't I?

1868
02:02:54,100 --> 02:02:55,380
Okay, I got to be ready for this.

1869
02:02:55,380 --> 02:02:55,939
Let's go.

1870
02:02:55,939 --> 02:02:56,420
My loaded.

1871
02:02:56,420 --> 02:02:56,819
I'm loaded.

1872
02:02:56,819 --> 02:02:57,220
Get down.

1873
02:02:58,739 --> 02:03:08,010
Who else?

1874
02:03:08,010 --> 02:03:11,100
Where are you?

1875
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:13,720
Oh, nice.

1876
02:03:14,600 --> 02:03:17,369
Blox, come here.

1877
02:03:34,649 --> 02:03:35,609
Don't you spawn?

1878
02:03:35,689 --> 02:03:36,810
I know you're going to come over here.

1879
02:03:36,810 --> 02:03:37,689
You're going to spawn over there.

1880
02:03:37,689 --> 02:03:38,250
I know you are.

1881
02:03:38,250 --> 02:03:39,210
You're going to make a loud noise.

1882
02:03:39,210 --> 02:03:40,090
I'm going to freak you out.

1883
02:03:50,279 --> 02:03:52,710
Not yet, not yet, not yet, not yet, not yet.

1884
02:03:53,590 --> 02:04:02,090
No.

1885
02:04:02,090 --> 02:04:02,810
Hey.

1886
02:04:02,810 --> 02:04:04,329
Oh, my God.

1887
02:04:19,130 --> 02:04:19,630
Dick.

1888
02:04:27,399 --> 02:04:32,810
Help me.

1889
02:04:32,810 --> 02:04:41,300
Where's the grenade?

1890
02:04:43,460 --> 02:05:05,560
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.

1891
02:05:06,520 --> 02:05:14,619
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.

1892
02:05:28,890 --> 02:05:29,390
Where is he?

1893
02:05:30,090 --> 02:05:31,800
Where is he?

1894
02:05:32,520 --> 02:05:37,850
I don't know where the fuck he is.

1895
02:05:38,569 --> 02:05:47,159
Right there.

1896
02:05:47,159 --> 02:05:49,289
He just threw a grenade at himself.

1897
02:06:16,600 --> 02:06:17,319
What was wrong?

1898
02:06:18,119 --> 02:06:20,779
I knocked out the fucking clip.

1899
02:06:22,069 --> 02:06:23,750
Okay, I got to be ready for this one.

1900
02:06:23,750 --> 02:06:24,149
I'm ready.

1901
02:06:24,149 --> 02:06:24,710
Let's go.

1902
02:06:24,710 --> 02:06:25,750
Tighten these straps up.

1903
02:06:25,750 --> 02:06:33,670
Kind of like pretending to be bad.

1904
02:06:34,789 --> 02:06:36,710
All right, let me ask a question.

1905
02:06:37,270 --> 02:06:39,350
You got a guy shooting at you over here.

1906
02:06:39,350 --> 02:06:44,149
You got two monsters behind you and a guy spitting acid across the map.

1907
02:06:44,869 --> 02:06:47,430
Sorry that like priority number one is not like, you know, like.

1908
02:06:48,550 --> 02:06:48,949
Oh, yeah.

1909
02:06:49,989 --> 02:06:51,350
It's I'm dead.

1910
02:06:51,350 --> 02:06:53,350
Scary things are happening surrounding me.

1911
02:06:53,350 --> 02:06:53,850
Not, hey.

1912
02:06:55,510 --> 02:06:56,390
Oh, yeah, nice.

1913
02:06:56,390 --> 02:06:57,109
Oh, hey, what's going on?

1914
02:06:59,109 --> 02:07:00,310
No, it's terrifying.

1915
02:07:08,680 --> 02:07:09,319
Just win.

1916
02:07:12,010 --> 02:07:12,810
Just win.

1917
02:07:12,810 --> 02:07:13,689
All right, fine.

1918
02:07:13,689 --> 02:07:14,189
Okay.

1919
02:09:20,550 --> 02:09:25,689
Stop.

1920
02:09:25,689 --> 02:09:26,649
Eat shit.

1921
02:09:26,649 --> 02:09:32,579
I don't know the trajectory.

1922
02:09:32,579 --> 02:09:33,699
I didn't know the trajectory.

1923
02:09:33,699 --> 02:09:34,819
I didn't know the trajectory.

1924
02:09:41,380 --> 02:09:43,060
What's this aim you got in front of you?

1925
02:09:43,060 --> 02:09:43,859
A fucking throw?

1926
02:09:56,199 --> 02:09:56,600
Open.

1927
02:09:59,270 --> 02:09:59,670
Open.

1928
02:09:59,670 --> 02:10:00,789
I want it open.

1929
02:10:01,909 --> 02:10:02,789
I can't open it.

1930
02:10:14,939 --> 02:10:42,819
How do you know where I even am, dude?

1931
02:11:08,069 --> 02:11:18,659
Give me that.

1932
02:11:18,659 --> 02:11:19,300
Oh, yeah.

1933
02:11:19,300 --> 02:11:19,939
Oh, yeah.

1934
02:11:20,659 --> 02:11:40,250
What the fuck?

1935
02:11:45,619 --> 02:11:46,500
Why?

1936
02:11:46,500 --> 02:11:52,039
The top button.

1937
02:11:52,600 --> 02:11:59,960
Press the reload button.

1938
02:12:01,239 --> 02:12:10,340
The controller broken.

1939
02:12:25,539 --> 02:12:34,310
This hitched down tempo slowed down doom music.

1940
02:12:35,270 --> 02:12:37,210
Oh, my God.

1941
02:12:37,850 --> 02:12:47,859
All right, now reload.

1942
02:12:51,130 --> 02:12:52,010
Why?

1943
02:12:52,010 --> 02:12:53,479
Why are you doing this?

1944
02:12:54,520 --> 02:12:55,960
Why are you doing this?

1945
02:12:55,960 --> 02:12:57,159
Oh, my God.

1946
02:12:57,159 --> 02:12:58,520
Okay, see you in hell.

1947
02:12:59,720 --> 02:13:20,619
Oh, shit.

1948
02:13:29,819 --> 02:13:30,939
What's wrong with it?

1949
02:13:31,659 --> 02:13:40,489
How many bullets?

1950
02:13:40,489 --> 02:13:40,970
I need to...

1951
02:13:41,770 --> 02:13:50,039
What am I supposed to do?

1952
02:13:50,039 --> 02:13:50,680
Holy shit.

1953
02:13:51,399 --> 02:13:53,020
Get away from me.

1954
02:13:53,899 --> 02:13:54,779
Get away from me.

1955
02:13:54,779 --> 02:13:55,100
Get away.

1956
02:13:55,100 --> 02:13:55,819
Don't come in here.

1957
02:14:01,050 --> 02:14:01,770
No.

1958
02:14:01,770 --> 02:14:02,090
This is...

1959
02:14:12,090 --> 02:14:12,649
Valve.

1960
02:14:13,770 --> 02:14:14,250
Valve.

1961
02:14:14,970 --> 02:14:21,609
I can do it with this.

1962
02:14:24,470 --> 02:14:25,750
Why can't I do it with this?

1963
02:14:37,960 --> 02:14:39,560
I was hitting the wrong button.

1964
02:14:40,939 --> 02:14:41,659
Not anymore.

1965
02:14:49,829 --> 02:14:52,470
I was hitting this one not to grip.

1966
02:14:53,510 --> 02:14:54,310
Give it to me, duck.

1967
02:15:00,619 --> 02:15:01,579
Valve.

1968
02:15:01,579 --> 02:15:02,060
Valve.

1969
02:15:02,619 --> 02:15:13,109
Oh, that's not why I was valving.

1970
02:15:13,109 --> 02:15:13,510
That's not...

1971
02:15:13,510 --> 02:15:14,630
I was valving over this.

1972
02:15:15,270 --> 02:15:16,470
I was valving over this.

1973
02:15:23,430 --> 02:15:24,149
Got it.

1974
02:15:24,149 --> 02:15:36,010
Oh, shit.

1975
02:15:36,010 --> 02:15:37,130
That was crazy.

1976
02:15:37,130 --> 02:15:38,170
You want to swap in here?

1977
02:15:39,560 --> 02:15:42,420
Nah, I would probably die in the...

1978
02:15:42,420 --> 02:15:43,539
Same shoulder as that arm.

1979
02:15:44,260 --> 02:15:44,500
Oh.

1980
02:15:45,460 --> 02:15:46,119
I...

1981
02:15:46,119 --> 02:15:46,600
That's a matter.

1982
02:15:46,600 --> 02:15:47,319
I've done that before.

1983
02:15:47,319 --> 02:15:47,640
Ready?

1984
02:15:48,439 --> 02:15:54,539
All right.

1985
02:15:54,539 --> 02:15:55,739
Well, but now it's working.

1986
02:15:55,739 --> 02:15:56,380
Like, it does like...

1987
02:15:59,460 --> 02:16:00,819
It works when you don't...

1988
02:16:00,819 --> 02:16:01,859
It doesn't work when you don't want it to.

1989
02:16:03,060 --> 02:16:03,779
I don't understand.

1990
02:16:03,779 --> 02:16:05,460
Like, you've seen me do the same motions.

1991
02:16:06,789 --> 02:16:07,270
Every time.

1992
02:16:07,989 --> 02:16:12,310
Well, it changed.

1993
02:16:12,310 --> 02:16:12,869
Nothing.

1994
02:16:12,869 --> 02:16:13,430
I just...

1995
02:16:13,430 --> 02:16:14,149
It's just...

1996
02:16:14,149 --> 02:16:15,109
I can't show it to you.

1997
02:16:19,210 --> 02:16:25,100
Valve.

1998
02:16:25,100 --> 02:16:25,819
Valve wants to work.

1999
02:16:25,819 --> 02:16:26,380
They're watching.

2000
02:16:35,350 --> 02:16:36,389
Valve.

2001
02:16:36,389 --> 02:16:40,200
Last three.

2002
02:16:40,920 --> 02:16:45,159
Three shells left.

2003
02:16:47,479 --> 02:16:48,360
Valve.

2004
02:16:59,979 --> 02:17:00,780
Valvin.

2005
02:17:01,739 --> 02:17:02,299
Last two.

2006
02:17:04,389 --> 02:17:05,030
Out of shells.

2007
02:17:13,139 --> 02:17:13,620
I need to...

2008
02:17:13,620 --> 02:17:14,659
I want ammo and stuff.

2009
02:17:14,659 --> 02:17:15,540
I'm not gonna fuck around.

2010
02:17:15,540 --> 02:17:16,899
This is like the end of the game.

2011
02:17:16,899 --> 02:17:18,739
I got like an hour left in the game or something.

2012
02:17:19,540 --> 02:17:21,620
I got like one chapter or two chapters left, right?

2013
02:17:22,180 --> 02:17:23,299
I want to make sure I get everything.

2014
02:17:23,299 --> 02:17:24,180
We're just gonna expand.

2015
02:17:25,139 --> 02:17:29,930
All right.

2016
02:17:29,930 --> 02:17:30,250
Nothing.

2017
02:17:30,250 --> 02:17:30,649
Let's go.

2018
02:17:41,319 --> 02:17:42,040
That's the monitor.

2019
02:17:43,180 --> 02:17:44,059
That's my monitor.

2020
02:17:45,299 --> 02:17:46,899
I just hooked it and almost pulled it down.

2021
02:18:45,219 --> 02:18:51,739
Okay.

2022
02:18:51,739 --> 02:18:53,420
There's only one point of entry.

2023
02:19:10,659 --> 02:19:11,379
Wait, do you have to...

2024
02:19:11,379 --> 02:19:12,260
Does it all...

2025
02:19:12,260 --> 02:19:13,540
Does it have to be on...

2026
02:19:13,540 --> 02:19:15,059
I don't think it has to be on them all at the same time.

2027
02:19:15,620 --> 02:19:17,219
I thought that's what was going on.

2028
02:19:18,340 --> 02:19:18,659
Okay.

2029
02:19:19,459 --> 02:19:20,010
Oh.

2030
02:19:21,290 --> 02:19:21,610
It does.

2031
02:20:18,780 --> 02:20:19,659
Oh, are you on?

2032
02:20:19,659 --> 02:20:21,180
It's gonna take him 20 minutes.

2033
02:20:21,180 --> 02:20:36,809
Took me five.

2034
02:20:36,809 --> 02:20:38,170
Odd Watchers already skipped.

2035
02:20:38,170 --> 02:20:38,809
And guess what?

2036
02:20:39,610 --> 02:20:40,969
That's on them.

2037
02:20:40,969 --> 02:20:43,690
Because they sat there probably for that five minutes going...

2038
02:20:43,690 --> 02:20:44,329
Oh, no, no, no.

2039
02:20:44,329 --> 02:20:44,649
He's gonna...

2040
02:20:44,649 --> 02:20:46,010
It's gonna take him 20 minutes.

2041
02:20:46,010 --> 02:20:46,569
They just went...

2042
02:20:47,930 --> 02:20:48,489
And ended up...

2043
02:20:48,489 --> 02:20:48,809
Whoa!

2044
02:20:48,809 --> 02:20:49,530
The final boss.

2045
02:20:49,530 --> 02:20:50,569
And they just spoiled the whole thing.

2046
02:20:50,569 --> 02:20:51,290
So you know what?

2047
02:20:51,290 --> 02:20:51,610
You just...

2048
02:20:51,610 --> 02:20:52,250
You did that.

2049
02:20:52,250 --> 02:20:52,649
I didn't.

2050
02:20:54,020 --> 02:20:54,979
I'm just playing the game.

2051
02:20:54,979 --> 02:20:55,780
Breaking and entering.

2052
02:20:58,149 --> 02:20:58,709
After is this?

2053
02:21:03,770 --> 02:21:04,090
After...

2054
02:21:04,809 --> 02:21:06,459
After we're in.

2055
02:21:07,610 --> 02:21:08,729
After 10 out of 11.

2056
02:21:08,729 --> 02:21:09,209
Oh, shit.

2057
02:21:09,209 --> 02:21:09,370
All right.

2058
02:21:09,370 --> 02:21:10,010
We're almost done.

2059
02:21:12,020 --> 02:21:13,219
I don't know what I've been screaming for.

2060
02:21:13,940 --> 02:21:15,450
I can't even tell.

2061
02:21:15,450 --> 02:21:16,010
I have no idea.

2062
02:21:19,030 --> 02:21:19,510
Chapter 10.

2063
02:21:20,309 --> 02:21:27,180
Somebody is just lighting up antlions.

2064
02:21:38,870 --> 02:21:39,510
Chapter 10.

2065
02:21:40,540 --> 02:21:41,020
Okay.

2066
02:21:42,059 --> 02:21:42,459
Kill...

2067
02:21:42,459 --> 02:21:43,180
Oh, hi.

2068
02:21:55,459 --> 02:21:56,020
I see.

2069
02:21:56,020 --> 02:21:56,260
Okay.

2070
02:21:57,219 --> 02:21:59,500
Are so good.

2071
02:21:59,500 --> 02:22:00,780
When do we get to see Gordon Freeman?

2072
02:22:00,780 --> 02:22:01,819
I'm actually excited for this.

2073
02:22:02,379 --> 02:22:06,940
We are gonna get a Gordon Freeman appearance.

2074
02:22:14,709 --> 02:22:19,639
Did I wake them up?

2075
02:22:19,639 --> 02:22:20,040
Wait.

2076
02:22:20,040 --> 02:22:20,360
Um...

2077
02:22:22,100 --> 02:22:23,299
Holy shit, dude.

2078
02:22:24,500 --> 02:22:31,989
I don't know.

2079
02:22:31,989 --> 02:22:32,149
I'm...

2080
02:22:36,010 --> 02:22:36,649
Just a stick.

2081
02:22:37,370 --> 02:23:00,860
Off the AC.

2082
02:23:02,459 --> 02:23:03,020
So good.

2083
02:23:03,899 --> 02:23:05,510
Hunts are fighting.

2084
02:23:05,510 --> 02:23:05,829
Why?

2085
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:07,239
Why?

2086
02:23:12,889 --> 02:23:17,930
I'm gonna store this.

2087
02:23:17,930 --> 02:23:19,129
I already have one stored.

2088
02:23:20,180 --> 02:23:21,139
I have too much HP.

2089
02:23:30,569 --> 02:23:30,809
Okay.

2090
02:23:31,770 --> 02:23:38,809
I heard something in there,

2091
02:23:38,809 --> 02:23:40,409
and I'm gonna fuck off real quick.

2092
02:23:42,250 --> 02:23:46,709
Oh, boy.

2093
02:23:46,709 --> 02:23:47,030
Okay.

2094
02:23:48,309 --> 02:23:55,899
I've got a lot of shit on you, man.

2095
02:23:56,620 --> 02:23:59,059
I've got like 60 bullets on you.

2096
02:23:59,700 --> 02:24:02,149
Not that I'm gonna miss, probably.

2097
02:24:07,219 --> 02:24:13,350
I thought he was alive.

2098
02:24:13,350 --> 02:24:15,110
I thought he was queuing up for an attack.

2099
02:24:15,350 --> 02:24:15,750
God damn it.

2100
02:24:18,250 --> 02:24:19,049
How many can I have on here?

2101
02:24:19,770 --> 02:24:30,489
I can't do a double.

2102
02:24:31,209 --> 02:24:31,770
I have to use it.

2103
02:24:33,690 --> 02:24:34,170
Get under there.

2104
02:24:34,170 --> 02:24:34,649
Hold on.

2105
02:24:40,379 --> 02:24:45,850
Reload this, too, by the way.

2106
02:24:45,850 --> 02:24:46,409
No!

2107
02:24:57,139 --> 02:24:57,860
Push L's left.

2108
02:24:58,659 --> 02:24:59,459
This rolls to somebody.

2109
02:24:59,459 --> 02:25:01,260
I don't really even care.

2110
02:25:01,260 --> 02:25:09,260
All right.

2111
02:25:09,260 --> 02:25:15,850
So, if you take down that,

2112
02:25:15,850 --> 02:25:19,159
that thing's gonna come down.

2113
02:25:19,159 --> 02:25:22,100
If I climb up to this, I'm assuming.

2114
02:25:23,219 --> 02:25:24,649
Okay.

2115
02:25:24,649 --> 02:25:25,209
Help you?

2116
02:25:25,850 --> 02:25:26,409
Bored.

2117
02:25:26,409 --> 02:25:32,170
Bored penis.

2118
02:25:32,170 --> 02:25:32,729
Okay.

2119
02:25:32,729 --> 02:25:35,379
I wasn't expecting that.

2120
02:25:35,379 --> 02:25:36,100
Bored penis.

2121
02:25:36,100 --> 02:25:36,579
Okay.

2122
02:25:36,579 --> 02:25:37,219
I'll...

2123
02:25:37,219 --> 02:25:38,180
What am I gonna do?

2124
02:25:38,180 --> 02:25:38,420
I...

2125
02:25:39,139 --> 02:25:39,700
I'll be there.

2126
02:25:42,139 --> 02:25:42,940
Oh, fuck the grenade.

2127
02:25:43,659 --> 02:26:16,250
Thought I had it.

2128
02:26:16,250 --> 02:26:16,889
Oops, sorry.

2129
02:26:18,549 --> 02:26:18,790
I...

2130
02:26:19,350 --> 02:26:19,750
Watch this.

2131
02:26:20,309 --> 02:26:26,120
You just, like, pull the thing out?

2132
02:26:29,829 --> 02:26:30,469
Okay.

2133
02:26:30,469 --> 02:26:31,799
Did it work?

2134
02:26:31,799 --> 02:26:41,559
Okay.

2135
02:26:41,559 --> 02:26:59,110
Oh, shit.

2136
02:26:59,110 --> 02:27:00,309
I did it, kind of.

2137
02:27:00,309 --> 02:27:01,110
Okay.

2138
02:27:01,110 --> 02:27:01,590
Now what?

2139
02:27:02,629 --> 02:27:24,379
God, I am supposed to get up here, isn't it?

2140
02:27:24,379 --> 02:27:24,940
Move this.

2141
02:27:33,590 --> 02:27:41,540
Come on.

2142
02:27:41,540 --> 02:27:52,600
Just get out of the fucking way.

2143
02:27:52,600 --> 02:27:53,159
Okay.

2144
02:27:53,159 --> 02:27:53,799
Stay open.

2145
02:27:55,079 --> 02:27:55,399
Oh.

2146
02:27:55,959 --> 02:28:00,100
He's...

2147
02:28:00,100 --> 02:28:01,379
Okay, the box is a distraction.

2148
02:28:02,899 --> 02:28:08,920
It worked.

2149
02:28:08,920 --> 02:28:09,879
I shot at the box.

2150
02:28:19,180 --> 02:28:19,739
Oh, Chad.

2151
02:28:19,739 --> 02:28:20,700
We're crying.

2152
02:28:20,700 --> 02:28:21,899
What's going on here?

2153
02:28:21,899 --> 02:28:23,850
I can't even spam.

2154
02:28:23,850 --> 02:28:24,809
What do I...

2155
02:28:24,809 --> 02:28:25,290
I'm...

2156
02:28:25,290 --> 02:28:26,489
I'm stuck in VR.

2157
02:28:26,489 --> 02:28:27,129
What do you want me to do?

2158
02:28:27,930 --> 02:28:31,299
F.A. hands.

2159
02:28:31,299 --> 02:28:32,180
Mods are fighting.

2160
02:28:32,180 --> 02:28:33,299
This is a bad Chad.

2161
02:28:34,260 --> 02:28:35,139
Mods are fighting.

2162
02:28:36,420 --> 02:28:37,379
I don't know what's going on.

2163
02:28:39,989 --> 02:28:41,030
Attention to us.

2164
02:28:41,030 --> 02:28:42,469
Escape the Matrix.

2165
02:28:44,489 --> 02:28:44,729
All right.

2166
02:28:44,729 --> 02:28:45,370
I'm about...

2167
02:28:45,370 --> 02:28:46,090
Listen to me.

2168
02:28:46,090 --> 02:28:48,889
I'm about to get to the end of a game that's pretty good.

2169
02:28:49,530 --> 02:28:50,409
I want to enjoy it.

2170
02:28:53,829 --> 02:28:55,190
Cease this fighting at once.

2171
02:29:13,579 --> 02:29:14,540
Holy shit.

2172
02:29:14,540 --> 02:29:20,250
This is hard.

2173
02:29:20,250 --> 02:29:20,569
No.

2174
02:29:22,299 --> 02:29:25,899
And again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again.

2175
02:29:25,899 --> 02:29:32,520
I need to get to start.

2176
02:29:32,520 --> 02:29:32,760
Why?

2177
02:29:32,760 --> 02:29:33,559
I don't even get to start.

2178
02:29:33,559 --> 02:29:35,239
I think it's just to start this thing.

2179
02:29:35,239 --> 02:29:38,440
Put it in emote only mode?

2180
02:29:38,440 --> 02:29:39,959
Throw it in emote only mode.

2181
02:29:39,959 --> 02:29:41,159
Throw it in emote only mode.

2182
02:29:41,159 --> 02:29:42,200
Teach him a lesson.

2183
02:29:55,850 --> 02:29:56,090
Shit.

2184
02:29:57,450 --> 02:30:09,180
It's like...

2185
02:30:40,069 --> 02:30:40,790
Get out of here.

2186
02:30:41,510 --> 02:30:44,250
All this for...

2187
02:30:44,250 --> 02:30:45,450
Oh, that's actually quite a bit.

2188
02:30:54,579 --> 02:30:55,459
I already have two hit...

2189
02:30:55,459 --> 02:30:55,620
No.

2190
02:30:56,579 --> 02:30:57,459
I'm gonna leave that.

2191
02:30:57,459 --> 02:30:58,340
I don't want it.

2192
02:30:58,340 --> 02:30:59,770
Fuck that thing.

2193
02:30:59,770 --> 02:31:04,920
What's in emote only mode?

2194
02:31:04,920 --> 02:31:05,239
All right.

2195
02:31:05,239 --> 02:31:06,040
Now, cut it out.

2196
02:31:06,680 --> 02:31:08,809
Cut this out.

2197
02:31:08,809 --> 02:31:10,090
Cut this nonsense out.

2198
02:31:10,809 --> 02:31:14,899
Cut it out.

2199
02:31:14,899 --> 02:31:19,290
Arranged.

2200
02:31:24,340 --> 02:31:25,459
Okay, let's move this.

2201
02:31:26,979 --> 02:31:29,139
Okay, that does that.

2202
02:31:49,350 --> 02:31:53,780
I'm about to slip it out?

2203
02:31:58,540 --> 02:32:11,750
How do I move that?

2204
02:32:12,469 --> 02:32:13,899
Another control?

2205
02:32:19,590 --> 02:32:30,709
Oh, sick.

2206
02:32:40,700 --> 02:32:41,180
Did it.

2207
02:32:41,180 --> 02:32:43,459
What the hell are you doing?

2208
02:32:43,459 --> 02:32:48,340
Oh, you're angry, but that's too much.

2209
02:32:48,340 --> 02:32:48,899
All right, let's go.

2210
02:32:53,430 --> 02:32:54,229
You're angry.

2211
02:32:55,030 --> 02:32:57,049
Oh, you're angry.

2212
02:32:57,049 --> 02:32:59,850
Where'd you even come from?

2213
02:33:00,649 --> 02:33:15,670
Progress.

2214
02:33:17,239 --> 02:33:17,719
Progress.

2215
02:33:30,459 --> 02:33:31,260
It was worth it.

2216
02:33:38,149 --> 02:33:39,030
That was close.

2217
02:33:39,829 --> 02:33:41,110
That was fucking close.

2218
02:33:42,409 --> 02:33:43,770
Holy shit, I almost died.

2219
02:33:44,809 --> 02:33:53,670
Wait, this way?

2220
02:33:54,870 --> 02:33:57,340
All right, let's go.

2221
02:33:58,139 --> 02:34:00,659
Oh.

2222
02:34:01,700 --> 02:34:02,979
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

2223
02:34:03,620 --> 02:34:05,299
Alex, we're getting close to the vault now.

2224
02:34:05,299 --> 02:34:06,180
I want the dot.

2225
02:34:06,180 --> 02:34:07,219
You don't have any more chances to use your weapon.

2226
02:34:07,219 --> 02:34:08,100
I want red dot on this.

2227
02:34:08,100 --> 02:34:08,979
Good point.

2228
02:34:08,979 --> 02:34:10,899
I'll see if there are any upgrades I can use.

2229
02:34:10,899 --> 02:34:11,219
The last upgrade.

2230
02:34:11,219 --> 02:34:13,299
I can't believe my pistol's made it this far.

2231
02:34:13,299 --> 02:34:14,739
I was thinking about giving it to Gordon.

2232
02:34:16,100 --> 02:34:17,459
This is the final upgrade of the game.

2233
02:34:17,459 --> 02:34:18,659
I want the red dot sight.

2234
02:34:19,620 --> 02:34:22,149
I want red dot on this.

2235
02:34:55,819 --> 02:34:56,139
Yes.

2236
02:35:22,469 --> 02:35:23,190
I did it?

2237
02:35:23,989 --> 02:35:24,549
No, I didn't.

2238
02:35:37,420 --> 02:35:37,979
Wake up.

2239
02:35:38,780 --> 02:35:39,420
Wake up.

2240
02:35:42,040 --> 02:35:42,840
Wake up.

2241
02:35:42,840 --> 02:35:43,559
Wake up.

2242
02:35:43,559 --> 02:35:45,159
It's time to wake up.

2243
02:35:45,159 --> 02:35:45,879
Laser sight.

2244
02:35:46,440 --> 02:35:46,680
Boom.

2245
02:35:47,879 --> 02:35:49,260
Final upgrade in the night.

2246
02:35:56,440 --> 02:35:56,920
That's it.

2247
02:35:57,639 --> 02:36:00,899
Let's see how good that looks now.

2248
02:36:00,899 --> 02:36:02,260
Now I can finally aim this gun.

2249
02:36:02,260 --> 02:36:02,819
Thank God.

2250
02:36:03,379 --> 02:36:05,780
It only took to the final 20 minutes of the game.

2251
02:36:06,739 --> 02:36:09,860
All right, are you going to?

2252
02:36:09,860 --> 02:36:11,379
I don't want to be on the wrong side of that.

2253
02:36:11,379 --> 02:36:12,329
Nice.

2254
02:36:15,370 --> 02:36:15,930
Hey, whatever.

2255
02:36:15,930 --> 02:36:16,489
Let him sleep.

2256
02:36:17,209 --> 02:36:21,750
Don't wake him up.

2257
02:36:22,309 --> 02:36:27,030
Be careful.

2258
02:36:27,670 --> 02:36:34,860
I love the red dot already.

2259
02:36:34,860 --> 02:36:35,420
Thank God.

2260
02:36:44,409 --> 02:36:45,209
Can we test it?

2261
02:36:46,010 --> 02:36:51,319
So good.

2262
02:36:52,520 --> 02:36:53,479
Oh, it's so good.

2263
02:36:54,200 --> 02:36:57,100
I can actually know what I'm doing.

2264
02:36:58,790 --> 02:37:07,000
It's still resident sleeper.

2265
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:08,360
I mean, I might as well just use it.

2266
02:37:11,319 --> 02:37:11,879
Wake up.

2267
02:37:13,209 --> 02:37:13,770
Wake up.

2268
02:37:17,129 --> 02:37:18,969
Oh, I know it's why it's on emote only mode.

2269
02:37:18,969 --> 02:37:19,450
I get it.

2270
02:37:20,010 --> 02:37:22,090
Because everyone was spamming,

2271
02:37:22,090 --> 02:37:24,090
but they're probably telling me the end of the video game.

2272
02:37:25,690 --> 02:37:27,129
I'm just realizing that now.

2273
02:37:27,129 --> 02:37:28,569
I think it's in emote only because like there's

2274
02:37:28,569 --> 02:37:30,170
going to be a big thing here.

2275
02:37:30,170 --> 02:37:32,090
And I don't want everyone's going to be spamming like

2276
02:37:32,090 --> 02:37:32,809
Gordon Freeman.

2277
02:37:32,809 --> 02:37:33,610
Gordon Freeman.

2278
02:37:34,489 --> 02:37:35,049
Right.

2279
02:37:35,049 --> 02:37:35,930
I figured it out.

2280
02:37:35,930 --> 02:37:36,409
That's why.

2281
02:37:37,290 --> 02:37:37,610
All right.

2282
02:37:38,250 --> 02:37:38,729
I get it.

2283
02:37:39,610 --> 02:37:45,239
I get it.

2284
02:37:47,959 --> 02:37:49,319
I think he's behind this door.

2285
02:37:49,319 --> 02:37:50,440
It's going to be Gordon Freeman.

2286
02:37:54,659 --> 02:38:07,770
White Gordon Freeman, but be back.

2287
02:38:15,739 --> 02:38:16,059
Hey.

2288
02:38:16,860 --> 02:38:17,979
Three left.

2289
02:38:31,879 --> 02:38:32,280
Ow.

2290
02:38:32,840 --> 02:38:40,219
Oh, shit.

2291
02:38:40,219 --> 02:38:40,940
He had the same idea.

2292
02:38:41,659 --> 02:38:46,020
That it?

2293
02:38:46,020 --> 02:38:52,969
Nothing in the car.

2294
02:38:52,969 --> 02:38:53,209
Okay.

2295
02:38:54,170 --> 02:38:55,129
Oh, my God.

2296
02:38:55,129 --> 02:38:55,450
Damn it.

2297
02:38:55,450 --> 02:38:55,690
Okay.

2298
02:38:55,690 --> 02:38:57,209
Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me.

2299
02:38:57,209 --> 02:38:57,530
Here we go.

2300
02:38:58,489 --> 02:39:01,860
Direct hit.

2301
02:39:01,860 --> 02:39:02,180
Got him.

2302
02:39:02,739 --> 02:39:04,709
What?

2303
02:39:05,270 --> 02:39:09,500
Come on.

2304
02:39:09,500 --> 02:39:11,610
Three cells left.

2305
02:39:11,610 --> 02:39:19,930
Oh, what the fuck?

2306
02:39:19,930 --> 02:39:47,739
Get the fuck out of here.

2307
02:39:48,459 --> 02:39:52,309
I hit every single shot on that guy.

2308
02:39:52,309 --> 02:39:53,110
Every single one.

2309
02:39:53,750 --> 02:40:06,329
This is full.

2310
02:40:06,969 --> 02:40:10,100
We're good.

2311
02:40:19,420 --> 02:40:20,059
Yeah.

2312
02:40:20,059 --> 02:40:22,299
We're going to need this.

2313
02:40:23,420 --> 02:40:24,840
My goodness.

2314
02:40:24,840 --> 02:40:25,479
My goodness.

2315
02:40:25,479 --> 02:40:26,120
Oh, my goodness.

2316
02:40:26,120 --> 02:40:26,520
Just wait.

2317
02:40:27,559 --> 02:40:27,799
Now.

2318
02:40:33,639 --> 02:40:35,739
I'll do it.

2319
02:40:35,739 --> 02:40:40,520
Don't come in.

2320
02:40:40,520 --> 02:40:41,000
Don't come in.

2321
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:41,479
Don't come in.

2322
02:40:41,479 --> 02:40:42,280
Don't come in.

2323
02:40:42,280 --> 02:40:43,000
Don't come in.

2324
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:43,799
I'm warning you.

2325
02:40:43,799 --> 02:40:44,280
Don't come in.

2326
02:40:45,799 --> 02:40:51,000
I tried to tell him.

2327
02:41:06,870 --> 02:41:07,430
Fuck.

2328
02:41:07,430 --> 02:41:08,680
I'm dead, man.

2329
02:41:08,680 --> 02:41:09,159
I'm dead.

2330
02:41:09,799 --> 02:41:10,680
Healing station.

2331
02:41:11,479 --> 02:41:17,049
Do it.

2332
02:41:17,610 --> 02:41:22,379
Gordon's going to be behind that door.

2333
02:41:23,020 --> 02:41:26,920
That was a full heal.

2334
02:41:26,920 --> 02:41:28,600
I think this is the only time in the whole game we've done a full heal.

2335
02:41:29,319 --> 02:41:30,600
Let's take a second here.

2336
02:41:31,159 --> 02:41:41,819
What else we got?

2337
02:41:41,819 --> 02:41:42,379
Nothing else?

2338
02:41:43,020 --> 02:41:45,239
Are we doing an ammo?

2339
02:41:48,440 --> 02:41:48,680
Good?

2340
02:41:51,020 --> 02:41:51,260
Good.

2341
02:41:52,059 --> 02:41:53,100
Full.

2342
02:41:53,100 --> 02:41:53,739
Everything's full.

2343
02:41:53,739 --> 02:41:54,219
Full health.

2344
02:41:54,219 --> 02:41:54,700
Full ammo.

2345
02:41:54,700 --> 02:41:55,100
We're good.

2346
02:41:55,100 --> 02:42:10,170
Let's do it.

2347
02:42:10,170 --> 02:42:11,049
Get the stuff over here.

2348
02:42:11,049 --> 02:42:14,139
I don't think so.

2349
02:42:14,139 --> 02:42:14,459
All right.

2350
02:42:16,739 --> 02:42:18,020
It's still in E mode only.

2351
02:42:18,020 --> 02:42:18,579
Holy shit.

2352
02:42:18,579 --> 02:42:20,420
That means something big must be about to happen.

2353
02:42:22,090 --> 02:42:23,209
Something huge.

2354
02:42:23,209 --> 02:42:36,739
Nothing even in here.

2355
02:42:40,780 --> 02:42:41,420
Okay.

2356
02:42:41,420 --> 02:42:42,620
Is Gordon going to open this door?

2357
02:42:42,620 --> 02:42:43,260
Does he talk?

2358
02:42:45,579 --> 02:42:46,379
Alex Scott.

2359
02:42:46,379 --> 02:42:47,340
So good to see you.

2360
02:42:47,340 --> 02:42:48,059
My name's Gordon.

2361
02:42:48,780 --> 02:42:49,860
I know.

2362
02:42:49,860 --> 02:42:50,659
I hope they do that.

2363
02:42:50,659 --> 02:42:51,299
I hope he talks.

2364
02:42:59,379 --> 02:42:59,620
Yeah.

2365
02:42:59,620 --> 02:43:00,899
Combine's really up.

2366
02:43:00,899 --> 02:43:02,739
Really creeping up on our ass.

2367
02:43:03,540 --> 02:43:09,319
That will be an oh shit moment.

2368
02:43:09,319 --> 02:43:09,959
I'll tell you that.

2369
02:43:27,430 --> 02:43:28,950
Get out of here, you fucking toys.

2370
02:43:44,139 --> 02:43:57,100
Let's go.

2371
02:43:57,100 --> 02:44:03,450
I got all the way up to the top of the tower.

2372
02:44:04,729 --> 02:44:10,219
Oh, we're going to get attacked by the drones now.

2373
02:44:10,219 --> 02:44:10,860
This is great.

2374
02:44:10,860 --> 02:44:11,340
Okay.

2375
02:44:11,340 --> 02:44:12,620
Just slowly go through this.

2376
02:44:13,819 --> 02:44:29,899
Out of here.

2377
02:44:33,219 --> 02:44:36,260
How do I get up here?

2378
02:44:36,260 --> 02:44:36,819
Oh shit.

2379
02:44:36,819 --> 02:44:37,059
Okay.

2380
02:44:37,059 --> 02:44:37,620
I'm going to jump.

2381
02:44:40,139 --> 02:44:40,780
There.

2382
02:44:40,780 --> 02:44:41,799
Here.

2383
02:44:41,799 --> 02:44:45,399
Don't fall.

2384
02:44:46,120 --> 02:44:46,600
Don't fall.

2385
02:44:55,719 --> 02:44:57,399
Oh, you lucky bastard.

2386
02:44:57,399 --> 02:44:57,959
Three left.

2387
02:45:00,090 --> 02:45:00,649
Last one.

2388
02:45:18,389 --> 02:45:20,149
Still E mode only.

2389
02:45:20,149 --> 02:45:20,870
Oh, fuck.

2390
02:45:22,629 --> 02:45:25,430
G-Man's going to be on the top of this tower naked

2391
02:45:25,430 --> 02:45:27,829
by the amount of how long E mode only mode has been on.

2392
02:45:30,120 --> 02:45:31,399
Hello, Gordon Freeman.

2393
02:45:32,200 --> 02:45:32,520
Hey.

2394
02:45:35,399 --> 02:45:36,040
I'm sorry.

2395
02:45:36,840 --> 02:45:47,979
Holy shit.

2396
02:45:54,790 --> 02:45:55,670
He put his hand down.

2397
02:46:05,420 --> 02:46:06,700
Oh, hello, Mr. Freeman.

2398
02:46:07,659 --> 02:46:08,620
It's me, G-Man.

2399
02:46:08,620 --> 02:46:10,860
And by the way, G-Man is Gordon Freeman.

2400
02:46:12,219 --> 02:46:25,030
I'm ready.

2401
02:46:25,670 --> 02:46:30,729
I don't need it yet.

2402
02:46:34,819 --> 02:46:47,959
Oh, he hit behind the force field.

2403
02:46:47,959 --> 02:46:48,360
Cheater.

2404
02:46:49,879 --> 02:46:58,219
Another one.

2405
02:46:58,219 --> 02:46:58,780
Another guy.

2406
02:46:59,500 --> 02:47:00,840
I hear a loud sound.

2407
02:47:01,479 --> 02:47:02,200
I think it's a big guy.

2408
02:47:02,200 --> 02:47:02,680
It's a big guy.

2409
02:47:02,680 --> 02:47:03,079
It's a big guy.

2410
02:47:03,079 --> 02:47:04,040
Huge guy.

2411
02:47:04,040 --> 02:47:04,760
Big guy coming in.

2412
02:47:18,379 --> 02:47:19,739
Who's the big guy now?

2413
02:47:24,860 --> 02:47:25,340
Vampire.

2414
02:47:25,340 --> 02:47:26,459
There's only one way you can go.

2415
02:47:26,459 --> 02:47:40,020
You son of a bitch.

2416
02:47:40,020 --> 02:47:41,540
Get the final electricity puzzle.

2417
02:47:53,139 --> 02:47:55,299
We're like 12 hours into the game.

2418
02:47:55,299 --> 02:47:57,860
You're going to put like the wood in front of the door still.

2419
02:47:58,659 --> 02:48:00,260
You're still going to put the wood in front of the door?

2420
02:48:06,680 --> 02:48:07,719
Alex, you there?

2421
02:48:07,719 --> 02:48:08,200
Yeah, dad.

2422
02:48:08,760 --> 02:48:11,639
It looks like you will be able to get into the vault from up there.

2423
02:48:11,639 --> 02:48:13,879
There's a terminal that extends a bridge to the entrance.

2424
02:48:14,520 --> 02:48:16,200
What's the security like inside?

2425
02:48:16,200 --> 02:48:16,600
Security.

2426
02:48:16,600 --> 02:48:20,360
God, it all laid out in front of me and I tell you, there is security.

2427
02:48:20,360 --> 02:48:22,440
But I've never seen anything like it.

2428
02:48:22,440 --> 02:48:23,639
It doesn't make any sense.

2429
02:48:24,200 --> 02:48:25,479
I guess I'll have to improvise.

2430
02:48:26,360 --> 02:48:27,639
Don't worry, honey.

2431
02:48:27,639 --> 02:48:28,360
I'll figure it out.

2432
02:48:29,159 --> 02:48:32,440
It's kind of satisfying when you pull the things off.

2433
02:48:32,440 --> 02:48:35,430
They don't even need to do that.

2434
02:48:35,430 --> 02:48:46,229
Well, we're like going way, way up here.

2435
02:48:56,819 --> 02:48:58,809
We are.

2436
02:48:58,809 --> 02:48:59,930
Alex, get ahead.

2437
02:48:59,930 --> 02:49:01,850
Those controls dock the vault to the station.

2438
02:49:04,540 --> 02:49:06,780
Mike, I've came to the inside of a piano.

2439
02:49:07,659 --> 02:49:08,979
What should I do?

2440
02:49:09,780 --> 02:49:18,500
All right, time to go rescue the savior of humanity.

2441
02:49:18,500 --> 02:49:19,780
Oh, we have to go in there?

2442
02:49:19,780 --> 02:49:20,579
You haven't been doing it.

2443
02:49:26,549 --> 02:49:31,239
All right, looks like the bridge is fully extended.

2444
02:49:31,239 --> 02:49:34,520
Just need to gently dock the vault to the bridge.

2445
02:49:35,159 --> 02:49:36,120
How far can that be?

2446
02:49:36,120 --> 02:49:36,680
How do you do that?

2447
02:49:37,319 --> 02:49:39,079
Oh, okay.

2448
02:49:39,079 --> 02:49:42,200
Well, one of these has to bring in the vault for Donnie, right?

2449
02:49:43,239 --> 02:49:44,040
Almost certainly.

2450
02:49:45,079 --> 02:49:45,799
Just pick one.

2451
02:49:46,360 --> 02:49:47,399
Immediately.

2452
02:49:47,399 --> 02:49:49,239
Four, five, six, nine.

2453
02:49:49,959 --> 02:49:51,719
Okay, we're going to do turn on nine.

2454
02:49:51,719 --> 02:49:52,219
Maybe.

2455
02:49:53,479 --> 02:49:54,760
No, not that one.

2456
02:49:54,760 --> 02:49:55,260
Eight.

2457
02:49:57,209 --> 02:49:58,329
Alex, the bridge isn't moving.

2458
02:49:58,329 --> 02:49:59,370
Why is the bridge not moving?

2459
02:49:59,370 --> 02:49:59,770
I know.

2460
02:49:59,770 --> 02:50:01,049
Russ, I can see it not moving.

2461
02:50:01,049 --> 02:50:02,250
Four, five, nine, eight, five.

2462
02:50:05,079 --> 02:50:05,579
Got it.

2463
02:50:06,200 --> 02:50:35,479
Here he comes, here he comes, here he comes, here he comes.

2464
02:50:36,440 --> 02:50:37,639
Come on, shh, shh, quiet, quiet.

2465
02:50:49,989 --> 02:50:52,229
Oh, it's not, it's a loading screen.

2466
02:50:52,790 --> 02:50:53,750
That was crazy though.

2467
02:51:09,899 --> 02:51:10,540
L-U-L.

2468
02:51:10,540 --> 02:51:12,540
All right, here we go, here we go, here it comes.

2469
02:51:14,840 --> 02:51:15,340
Alex?

2470
02:51:16,360 --> 02:51:16,860
Alex?

2471
02:51:17,899 --> 02:51:18,860
Alex, are you okay?

2472
02:51:19,500 --> 02:51:20,860
Jesus Christ.

2473
02:51:20,860 --> 02:51:23,100
I think I just killed Gordon Freeman.

2474
02:51:23,100 --> 02:51:24,139
The vault's right there.

2475
02:51:24,139 --> 02:51:25,020
Just go in and get him.

2476
02:51:26,940 --> 02:51:27,979
What is that thing?

2477
02:51:30,200 --> 02:51:33,879
Why is there a stretch Armstrong that's stretched way too much?

2478
02:51:41,879 --> 02:51:42,760
Holy shit, I'm dead.

2479
02:51:43,399 --> 02:51:47,930
Reload to safe.

2480
02:51:47,930 --> 02:51:48,729
Reload to safe.

2481
02:51:48,729 --> 02:51:49,370
Reload to safe.

2482
02:51:50,010 --> 02:51:51,930
Reload to safe.

2483
02:51:52,649 --> 02:51:54,180
Reload, please.

2484
02:51:54,739 --> 02:52:01,379
Reload to safe.

2485
02:52:01,940 --> 02:52:06,540
I don't want to waste that.

2486
02:52:06,540 --> 02:52:07,340
I'm probably going to need it.

2487
02:52:09,399 --> 02:52:18,219
Why is everybody doing that?

2488
02:52:19,819 --> 02:52:21,579
That was a, that, this is like a checkpoint.

2489
02:52:22,139 --> 02:52:26,250
Yeah, see?

2490
02:52:26,250 --> 02:52:27,530
We can start freaking out.

2491
02:52:28,489 --> 02:52:28,989
Alex?

2492
02:52:30,010 --> 02:52:30,969
Alex, are you okay?

2493
02:52:32,969 --> 02:52:35,209
I think I just killed Gordon Freeman.

2494
02:52:35,209 --> 02:52:36,250
The vault's right there.

2495
02:52:36,250 --> 02:52:37,209
Just go in and get him.

2496
02:52:37,850 --> 02:52:39,049
That's what they looked like up close.

2497
02:52:39,450 --> 02:52:40,170
I'm on my way.

2498
02:52:52,979 --> 02:52:53,780
Healing station.

2499
02:52:54,340 --> 02:52:59,690
Yeah, I wasted my injection.

2500
02:52:59,690 --> 02:53:00,569
I didn't even need to use it.

2501
02:53:16,149 --> 02:53:18,069
And here it comes.

2502
02:53:18,069 --> 02:53:19,670
Here it comes.

2503
02:53:19,670 --> 02:53:21,950
Where is he?

2504
02:53:32,629 --> 02:53:34,569
Make sure we're all loaded up.

2505
02:53:36,090 --> 02:53:39,319
Well, so.

2506
02:53:43,340 --> 02:53:52,069
I'm ready.

2507
02:53:52,069 --> 02:53:52,790
Even deeper.

2508
02:53:53,430 --> 02:53:56,139
Look at Earth's core.

2509
02:53:57,180 --> 02:54:21,909
That's that.

2510
02:54:22,629 --> 02:54:25,030
Oh, damn it.

2511
02:54:25,030 --> 02:54:27,270
Assessment shot 15 times

2512
02:54:27,270 --> 02:54:28,309
right in the face and chest.

2513
02:54:29,350 --> 02:54:49,989
Oh, that's not.

2514
02:54:49,989 --> 02:54:50,489
Fuck.

2515
02:55:09,780 --> 02:55:26,520
Full ammo.

2516
02:55:28,579 --> 02:55:39,479
Okay, we're even deeper now.

2517
02:55:43,299 --> 02:55:45,139
I thought that was Gordon Freeman for a second.

2518
02:55:45,139 --> 02:55:46,180
I was like, well, there he is.

2519
02:55:52,629 --> 02:55:54,620
Fuck.

2520
02:55:54,620 --> 02:55:55,979
I just showed him a firework.

2521
02:55:56,620 --> 02:56:06,190
Damn it.

2522
02:56:07,209 --> 02:56:08,219
Out of cells.

2523
02:56:13,690 --> 02:56:14,649
A strider.

2524
02:56:14,649 --> 02:56:15,530
Deactivated though.

2525
02:56:16,729 --> 02:56:17,690
Lucky break there.

2526
02:56:17,690 --> 02:56:18,729
Could you imagine that?

2527
02:56:18,729 --> 02:56:19,229
Strider.

2528
02:56:19,229 --> 02:56:19,930
Blocking your way.

2529
02:56:21,930 --> 02:56:22,649
Extra ammo.

2530
02:56:22,649 --> 02:56:23,149
Jinx me.

2531
02:56:27,700 --> 02:56:28,200
Dumb.

2532
02:56:34,250 --> 02:56:35,370
All right, what are we trying to do here?

2533
02:56:46,409 --> 02:56:48,010
In that room somewhere, apparently.

2534
02:56:48,889 --> 02:56:51,379
Broken.

2535
02:56:51,379 --> 02:56:52,500
The lift is fucked up.

2536
02:56:53,979 --> 02:56:55,020
Okay, let's keep going.

2537
02:57:03,610 --> 02:57:04,250
Sneak in there?

2538
02:57:04,889 --> 02:57:07,159
Crawl?

2539
02:57:07,620 --> 02:57:13,139
What the fuck?

2540
02:57:13,139 --> 02:57:32,170
Can't get in there.

2541
02:57:32,170 --> 02:57:32,729
Get rid of me.

2542
02:57:33,370 --> 02:57:34,579
Okay, I got it.

2543
02:57:35,219 --> 02:57:36,739
Wait, no, I have to prop up the door.

2544
02:57:37,379 --> 02:57:39,290
All right, I got to prop it up.

2545
02:57:51,639 --> 02:57:56,440
Made it.

2546
02:57:56,440 --> 02:57:57,479
Or this shit.

2547
02:57:57,479 --> 02:57:57,979
Okay.

2548
02:57:58,440 --> 02:58:02,409

03:41:00,620 --> 03:41:03,340
And we we just let him out. That's g-man and then that's not important for him

2717
03:41:04,059 --> 03:41:05,579
We're the bad guys

2718
03:41:05,579 --> 03:41:07,500
Holy shit

2719
03:41:07,500 --> 03:41:09,180
This changes everything

2720
03:41:09,180 --> 03:41:11,180
This changes the whole story

2721
03:41:11,729 --> 03:41:13,329
All right, gordon

2722
03:41:13,329 --> 03:41:17,549
Let's get you out of this. This change is literally the entire story

2723
03:41:18,909 --> 03:41:24,690
Holy shit. Okay. All right. I'm ready

2724
03:41:30,610 --> 03:41:36,770
Uncle festers vibration machine on maximum. I told you I told you

2725
03:41:37,569 --> 03:41:52,139
I told you we let that fucking guy out impressive work

2726
03:41:57,069 --> 03:42:04,049
freeman

2727
03:42:04,049 --> 03:42:07,950
Mr. You wouldn't need all that

2728
03:42:08,750 --> 03:42:10,350
to imprison

2729
03:42:10,350 --> 03:42:13,100
Gordon freeman

2730
03:42:13,180 --> 03:42:14,540
so

2731
03:42:14,540 --> 03:42:17,569
Who are you?

2732
03:42:17,569 --> 03:42:22,930
Perhaps what I am is not as important as what I can

2733
03:42:25,600 --> 03:42:27,600
in exchange for coming

2734
03:42:27,680 --> 03:42:29,680
Shut up

2735
03:42:31,079 --> 03:42:34,440
Some believe the fate of our world is

2736
03:42:35,700 --> 03:42:37,159
inflexible

2737
03:42:37,159 --> 03:42:40,489
lawyers

2738
03:42:42,239 --> 03:42:44,239
They authorize me to

2739
03:42:45,120 --> 03:42:58,329
Nod things in a particular direction from time. Would you miss vance?

2740
03:42:59,049 --> 03:43:03,850
Combine off i want the combine off earth

2741
03:43:07,079 --> 03:43:10,680
That would be a considerably large nudge

2742
03:43:12,200 --> 03:43:18,600
To given the interests of my employer fast

2743
03:43:19,159 --> 03:43:24,280
What if I could offer you something you don't know?

2744
03:43:25,000 --> 03:43:33,799
you

2745
03:43:33,799 --> 03:43:49,530
Dad

2746
03:43:49,530 --> 03:43:52,600
Is that me? What is this?

2747
03:43:53,239 --> 03:43:56,250
What's happening? We are in the future

2748
03:43:57,370 --> 03:44:01,129
This is the moment where you watch your father

2749
03:44:01,850 --> 03:44:06,719
die unless

2750
03:44:07,120 --> 03:44:08,940
What?

2751
03:44:08,940 --> 03:44:10,780
Unless what?

2752
03:44:10,780 --> 03:44:11,979
unless

2753
03:44:11,979 --> 03:44:15,579
You were to take matters into your own hand

2754
03:44:24,729 --> 03:44:29,840
Hey, I oh release your father

2755
03:44:32,000 --> 03:44:36,090
The trick dirty trick

2756
03:44:36,329 --> 03:44:45,850
Uh, it's the trick

2757
03:44:45,850 --> 03:44:48,409
As a consequence of your action

2758
03:44:48,969 --> 03:44:51,770
This entity will continue

2759
03:44:52,729 --> 03:44:54,729
and this entity

2760
03:44:55,129 --> 03:44:57,760
Will not right

2761
03:44:57,760 --> 03:44:59,440
So he's okay

2762
03:44:59,440 --> 03:45:00,479
right

2763
03:45:00,479 --> 03:45:02,159
He lives

2764
03:45:02,159 --> 03:45:03,920
My dad lives

2765
03:45:03,920 --> 03:45:08,799
You are aware that you've proven yourself to be of

2766
03:45:09,819 --> 03:45:15,639
Extraordinary value a previous hire has been unable

2767
03:45:16,360 --> 03:45:22,159
Or unwilling to perform the tasks laid before him

2768
03:45:23,209 --> 03:45:24,889
we

2769
03:45:24,969 --> 03:45:27,290
Struggle to find a suitable

2770
03:45:28,870 --> 03:45:30,649
Replacement

2771
03:45:30,649 --> 03:45:33,790
Until now no

2772
03:45:34,840 --> 03:45:36,840
I just want to go home

2773
03:45:36,920 --> 03:45:38,920
Send me home. I'm afraid

2774
03:45:39,719 --> 03:45:41,219
you

2775
03:45:41,219 --> 03:45:43,219
misunderstand the situation

2776
03:45:45,209 --> 03:45:46,590
Wait

2777
03:45:46,590 --> 03:45:48,590
Hey, wait, wait

2778
03:45:48,670 --> 03:45:52,379
Wait, fine. Hey, so

2779
03:45:53,739 --> 03:45:56,280
Alex vance has

2780
03:45:57,159 --> 03:45:58,809
fired

2781
03:45:58,889 --> 03:46:00,889
Hating a sign man

2782
03:46:02,959 --> 03:46:04,959
I thought he doesn't elive ants die

2783
03:46:06,139 --> 03:46:08,799
What happened?

2784
03:46:08,799 --> 03:46:10,799
what

2785
03:46:11,040 --> 03:46:12,959
Hold on a second. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

2786
03:46:12,959 --> 03:46:18,000
So we did we just like stopped that from happening, but it happens because this takes place before half-life two

2787
03:46:18,159 --> 03:46:20,079
What the fuck happened?

2788
03:46:20,079 --> 03:46:21,200
Wait, what?

2789
03:46:21,200 --> 03:46:24,620
Feel like what a different like time. Are we like a multiverse?

2790
03:46:29,049 --> 03:46:30,809
Keep watching. Okay

2791
03:46:30,809 --> 03:46:37,479
That was awesome that that last 45 minutes was in fucking sane

2792
03:46:38,840 --> 03:46:45,000
Okay, let me tell you something if you had if you had

2793
03:46:47,340 --> 03:46:55,389
Like a gigantic living room and like five lighthouses and you had an index and you had the knuckle controllers

2794
03:46:57,260 --> 03:47:00,620
Yeah, that last sequence would have been the most intense moment of your whole life

2795
03:47:00,940 --> 03:47:03,579
If you're if you were able to actually sprint around your living room

2796
03:47:03,659 --> 03:47:09,500
You gotta be careful though because you could like literally sprint sprint sprint and smash looney tune style

2797
03:47:09,819 --> 03:47:12,540
Into your wall and go right through it and leave a imprint

2798
03:47:13,899 --> 03:47:17,579
It'll be like boom through the door. I'm like the thing that looks like this like oh I look

2799
03:47:17,579 --> 03:47:19,579
It's a it's a person's body went through here

2800
03:47:21,020 --> 03:47:23,979
That was fucking crazy

2801
03:47:23,979 --> 03:47:26,780
There he is. There he is. There he is. There he is. There he is

2802
03:47:28,729 --> 03:47:31,129
Just glad robin walker worked on another fps

2803
03:47:31,770 --> 03:47:33,770
I am

2804
03:47:38,030 --> 03:47:43,479
Oh, that was great that was very good double db game audio of water brothers

2805
03:47:44,440 --> 03:47:46,440
I don't think that's good

2806
03:47:52,639 --> 03:47:54,639
Yeah, it's same g-man. Yeah

2807
03:47:55,040 --> 03:47:57,440
It tells you to know that g-man is the spy

2808
03:47:58,479 --> 03:48:03,420
Also a very talented actor probably can't hear a word i'm saying the music's coming very loud

2809
03:48:04,860 --> 03:48:19,770
It's an actor credit scene

2810
03:48:29,180 --> 03:48:35,069
Gordon gordon wake up gordon. She's gone gordon

2811
03:48:35,709 --> 03:48:36,909
She's gone

2812
03:48:36,909 --> 03:48:39,229
Son of a bitch in his unforeseen consequences

2813
03:48:40,030 --> 03:48:41,659
I knew it

2814
03:48:41,659 --> 03:48:43,659
When I get my hands on him

2815
03:48:43,899 --> 03:48:45,899
Oh

2816
03:48:56,540 --> 03:49:04,729
Listen to me, don't let me pick this up and then go back. Oh you're gonna end the game now

2817
03:49:05,370 --> 03:49:17,979
No

2818
03:49:17,979 --> 03:49:23,479
I got to touch it

2819
03:49:23,479 --> 03:49:24,680
Okay, so

2820
03:49:24,680 --> 03:49:27,420
You know advance is alive

2821
03:49:27,420 --> 03:49:29,420
That was the very those of you that have no idea

2822
03:49:30,700 --> 03:49:37,020
It's been like 15 years kind of pieces together too. So you live advance dies at the end of half life two episode two

2823
03:49:38,729 --> 03:49:40,729
That's where the that's where it's left off

2824
03:49:41,450 --> 03:49:42,969
this game

2825
03:49:42,969 --> 03:49:46,809
Where are you guys?

2826
03:49:46,809 --> 03:49:49,629
spoilers

2827
03:49:49,629 --> 03:49:51,309
what

2828
03:49:51,309 --> 03:49:53,870
You just watched him die on the ground

2829
03:49:54,510 --> 03:49:57,069
This is this is this is the third half-life game

2830
03:49:57,870 --> 03:50:01,659
What are you doing here?

2831
03:50:01,659 --> 03:50:02,780
anyways

2832
03:50:02,780 --> 03:50:03,739
so

2833
03:50:03,739 --> 03:50:05,100
Let me get this straight

2834
03:50:05,100 --> 03:50:13,500
You live advance dies at the end of half-life two episodes. Okay, this game takes place before half-life two

2835
03:50:14,059 --> 03:50:16,600
This is in between half-life one and half-life two

2836
03:50:17,319 --> 03:50:19,879
But so if that's the case when you play half-life two

2837
03:50:20,760 --> 03:50:22,760
He's to he dies in that game

2838
03:50:22,760 --> 03:50:25,159
It's not like and you know, you know, it'd be really fucking crazy

2839
03:50:25,399 --> 03:50:27,399
Here'd be crazy crazy valvy eliciting

2840
03:50:27,559 --> 03:50:31,959
How crazy would this be if they patched half-life two episode two and he don't fucking die now?

2841
03:50:32,440 --> 03:50:34,440
What a mind fuck that would be

2842
03:50:34,680 --> 03:50:42,010
Imagine they patched that shit

2843
03:50:42,010 --> 03:50:45,180
it was like

2844
03:50:45,180 --> 03:50:49,579
Alex vance went back and then messed with the timeline and it messed and it messed with your computer

2845
03:50:50,829 --> 03:50:53,389
Awesome. Oh, that's cool. I'm so but how does that work?

2846
03:51:03,180 --> 03:51:07,500
It's retcon so what so but half-life two episode two still is happens

2847
03:51:14,680 --> 03:51:18,440
That means this time travel that means that but but that well, but that also means

2848
03:51:19,239 --> 03:51:26,360
That somebody fucks up later in like half-life four which causes him to die anyways in half-life two episode two

2849
03:51:27,159 --> 03:51:31,290
Well, they've got a real can of worms to play with here whenever they do that

2850
03:51:34,780 --> 03:51:43,559
wrong

2851
03:51:43,559 --> 03:51:45,790
happens

2852
03:51:45,790 --> 03:51:47,959
And is a time traveler

2853
03:51:47,959 --> 03:51:49,959
Half-life two never happened

2854
03:51:52,000 --> 03:51:54,000
Half-life two never happened

2855
03:51:54,319 --> 03:51:57,450
No, but that but right there that was

2856
03:52:00,559 --> 03:52:05,280
Okay, i'm gonna i'm gonna have to go through quite a few reddit threads after the stream ends. I'm gonna have to watch

2857
03:52:06,239 --> 03:52:08,239
Half-life alex broken down

2858
03:52:08,719 --> 03:52:14,799
It's all fiction

2859
03:52:15,040 --> 03:52:17,120
Reddit theory. All right, let me get out of here

2860
03:52:18,729 --> 03:52:19,530
Oh

2861
03:52:19,530 --> 03:52:22,729
That was awesome

2862
03:52:22,729 --> 03:52:24,729
All right. I'm gonna have to give it an official score

2863
03:52:29,450 --> 03:52:31,690
An official score. My camera's lagging again

2864
03:52:32,250 --> 03:52:39,879
Definitely higher than eight

2865
03:52:39,879 --> 03:52:45,239
Definitely higher than nine

2866
03:52:45,319 --> 03:53:04,840
Definitely higher than a 92 higher than a 92

2867
03:53:05,639 --> 03:53:17,149
It's 94

2868
03:53:17,149 --> 03:53:22,120
done 9.4

2869
03:53:22,120 --> 03:53:27,770
94

2870
03:53:27,770 --> 03:53:37,049
Fantastic i'll tell you a little bit of the drop issues over the shoulder I had

2871
03:53:37,770 --> 03:53:39,930
Well, that's that's that's one little millipoint

2872
03:53:40,489 --> 03:53:42,270
two millipoints

2873
03:53:42,270 --> 03:53:44,299
and

2874
03:53:44,299 --> 03:53:47,260
The electricity kind of minigame thing where you switch the wires

2875
03:53:48,600 --> 03:53:51,159
Uh, I mean there's a little a little lot of those

2876
03:53:52,440 --> 03:53:56,729
9.4. That was your fault

2877
03:53:58,569 --> 03:54:00,569
end user problem

2878
03:54:01,739 --> 03:54:07,659
All right. Fine. We'll add two points, but then I take an extra two millipoints off for all the electricity puzzles. There you go

2879
03:54:08,139 --> 03:54:10,190
It's 9.4

2880
03:54:10,190 --> 03:54:14,489
Literally like the highest score i've given a game in like four years

2881
03:54:15,290 --> 03:54:21,559
Just say 10

2882
03:54:22,780 --> 03:54:25,020
What was the last time I gave a game higher than a nine?

2883
03:54:26,559 --> 03:54:28,559
I gave uh

2884
03:54:28,559 --> 03:54:33,120
I gave outer wilds an eight nine and eighty nine and people like wanted to kill me

2885
03:54:33,840 --> 03:54:42,090
House flipper vr. Yeah, we'll do that

2886
03:54:42,809 --> 03:54:45,469
That's the 22nd, right?

2887
03:54:45,469 --> 03:54:47,469
I still do

2888
03:54:49,799 --> 03:54:55,319
Now that was awesome. That was very very very good that exceeded my expectations and I didn't have any expectations

2889
03:54:55,399 --> 03:54:57,399
I told you i'm not doing that anymore

2890
03:54:57,399 --> 03:54:59,399
I'm not giving games expectations anymore

2891
03:55:00,110 --> 03:55:05,549
Because if I was going to be sitting here looking up shit every single day about half-life alex like I would have done

2892
03:55:07,280 --> 03:55:09,920
I'm not putting games on pedestals anymore. I'm just going to let them play

2893
03:55:11,819 --> 03:55:14,860
I didn't look up anything. I didn't even care about this game

2894
03:55:15,819 --> 03:55:19,260
I'm like this is like three and a half months late for what four and a half months late playing this

2895
03:55:19,819 --> 03:55:23,579
I didn't I just I just said you know what just it's gonna wow me if it doesn't

2896
03:55:24,299 --> 03:55:28,219
I'm not gonna look up anything. I don't want to like put it up higher because if I put it too high then it's not

2897
03:55:28,219 --> 03:55:29,180
Good enough

2898
03:55:29,180 --> 03:55:32,620
It was great

2899
03:55:32,620 --> 03:55:34,620
It was six months. Yeah, pretty late

2900
03:55:37,799 --> 03:55:41,559
Seven months late, whatever same deal same. It's within 12 months. It's okay

2901
03:55:43,559 --> 03:55:45,559
I'll play bone works. That's the plan

2902
03:55:47,479 --> 03:55:48,909
but

2903
03:55:48,909 --> 03:55:52,750
Uh, we're gonna move away from vr for a little while. I want my hair to grow back

2904
03:55:53,389 --> 03:55:55,389
I want my hair to grow back bad

2905
03:55:56,200 --> 03:55:58,200
Uh, we've been doing tons of vr

2906
03:55:58,920 --> 03:56:03,079
We're gonna move away from vr for a couple of weeks. We're gonna go back to playing a video game

2907
03:56:03,799 --> 03:56:06,639
That's not in a headset

2908
03:56:06,639 --> 03:56:08,639
I want I want if I saw two

2909
03:56:09,600 --> 03:56:13,260
Gotta do chubby bunny

2910
03:56:13,260 --> 03:56:15,500
We still have a bunch of 3do stuff that has to be done

2911
03:56:16,059 --> 03:56:19,840
We'll go back to vr

2912
03:56:20,079 --> 03:56:21,840
When we get close to halloween

2913
03:56:21,840 --> 03:56:27,040
Because then I have like three or four scary games we'll do we'll do like a halloween vr week. I play scary shit

2914
03:56:27,520 --> 03:56:35,290
Sounds like a plan

2915
03:56:35,290 --> 03:56:37,290
All right. Here's the ultimate question though

2916
03:56:37,930 --> 03:56:41,209
Is half-life alex worth getting a vr headset?

2917
03:56:46,030 --> 03:56:50,909
a lot of money

2918
03:56:50,909 --> 03:56:52,909
That's it's a shitload of money

2919
03:56:53,600 --> 03:56:57,200
I would say yes if there was realistically even

2920
03:56:58,840 --> 03:57:01,000
Like one or two other games

2921
03:57:01,719 --> 03:57:03,719
That with at this caliber

2922
03:57:04,649 --> 03:57:10,649
If you buy a vr headset for alex you're gonna be really fucking disappointed because every single other game you play on vr

2923
03:57:11,290 --> 03:57:13,290
Is way worse

2924
03:57:14,590 --> 03:57:20,270
So I would wait till there was another couple of these before you dish out four or five six seven hundred bucks

2925
03:57:20,829 --> 03:57:28,649
Now just because they're I mean look that you don't have like valve behind you make it your game

2926
03:57:29,129 --> 03:57:32,409
Well, let's be honest any vr game that is out now

2927
03:57:33,049 --> 03:57:35,049
I mean, you can't really compare you just can't

2928
03:57:35,450 --> 03:57:41,309
That doesn't mean they're not fun

2929
03:57:41,309 --> 03:57:44,670
And yeah the pc required to do so but uh, hold on a second though. Hold on

2930
03:57:46,360 --> 03:57:50,120
My pc is really not that good like it is but it's not

2931
03:57:50,920 --> 03:57:52,520
I have a 1080

2932
03:57:52,520 --> 03:57:54,920
and an i7 like 6800

2933
03:57:56,510 --> 03:57:58,670
so

2934
03:57:58,670 --> 03:58:01,469
I have like five or six year old hardware and it still ran it fine

2935
03:58:06,309 --> 03:58:08,590
780 can run it

2936
03:58:08,590 --> 03:58:12,590
Probably. Yeah, I mean I didn't see very much slow down and remember i'm streaming this too

2937
03:58:13,229 --> 03:58:15,229
So essentially like this is going through twice

2938
03:58:16,110 --> 03:58:20,590
Like my cpu is running double time because it's like encoding all the vr shit

2939
03:58:24,829 --> 03:58:26,860
source 2

2940
03:58:26,860 --> 03:58:28,860
Source 2 is pretty optimized. Yeah

2941
03:58:29,719 --> 03:58:33,319
My 1050 ran it fine with no problems. Yeah, you don't need like super crazy hardware

2942
03:58:37,870 --> 03:58:39,870
And it is still a high tier

2943
03:58:40,559 --> 03:58:43,680
I still think it's pretty good. I think it's done pretty good for me

2944
03:58:45,920 --> 03:58:47,920
Oh, all right

2945
03:58:47,920 --> 03:58:49,920
Let's do a hair check and then i'm gonna get out of here

2946
03:58:51,659 --> 03:58:52,700
pretty bad

2947
03:58:52,700 --> 03:58:59,690
And it is good enough right now. It's four and a half years old. Yeah, it's still it's still good

2948
03:59:01,280 --> 03:59:06,250
See

2949
03:59:06,250 --> 03:59:13,479
It actually looks kind of styled

2950
03:59:13,559 --> 03:59:16,360
Elvis what am I doing? Uh-huh. Ooh

2951
03:59:17,959 --> 03:59:21,159
That's that's like bargain bin. Elvis. Whoa

2952
03:59:21,879 --> 03:59:24,299
Look at that

2953
03:59:24,299 --> 03:59:28,219
No, i'm one of those angler fishes, you know, like the big teeth

2954
03:59:29,399 --> 03:59:37,479
And like the light bulb

2955
03:59:37,479 --> 03:59:39,879
All right, that's I gotta get out of here. I gotta fuck off

2956
03:59:41,579 --> 03:59:46,219
Uh, let's take a look and see what happened over the course of the stream. Let's do let's get the credits rolling

2957
03:59:46,219 --> 03:59:50,059
Thanks for watching everybody half-life alex awesome 9.4 out of 10. Wow

2958
03:59:51,819 --> 03:59:53,420
Thanks for subbing everybody

2959
03:59:53,420 --> 03:59:59,450
Speaking of which we had five community subs from prono varrox. Thank you

2960
04:00:01,120 --> 04:00:03,360
Five community subs from nukeable think we got that already

2961
04:00:07,209 --> 04:00:09,530
Fifty dollars that I missed this somebody said big bits

2962
04:00:11,450 --> 04:00:13,639
And here they are

2963
04:00:13,639 --> 04:00:15,639
Uh when I was in the headset, I couldn't really see

2964
04:00:16,969 --> 04:00:19,610
Uh pripro prep, thanks for the fifty dollars

2965
04:00:21,950 --> 04:00:27,149
The large amount of money you are by far the most enjoyable streamer to watch and i've been watching your videos for about eight years

2966
04:00:27,790 --> 04:00:30,829
Can't afford to give you the amount of bits. I would want to for entertaining me for years

2967
04:00:31,389 --> 04:00:33,229
Thanks for being you and doing what you do

2968
04:00:33,229 --> 04:00:37,790
If I ever have children i'm going to make them watch your videos to learn how to be funny as I couldn't educate them better

2969
04:00:37,790 --> 04:00:39,719
On that myself

2970
04:00:39,719 --> 04:00:44,280
If you uh show your children my videos, they're gonna end up in detention over and over again

2971
04:00:44,920 --> 04:00:49,000
I would hold off on that until they are at least probably at least until they're 18

2972
04:00:52,280 --> 04:00:54,280
You show your kids my videos

2973
04:00:54,440 --> 04:00:58,280
Uh, I think you might see some bad behavior coming through

2974
04:01:05,479 --> 04:01:10,200
What do you want me to say, okay, wait wait till they're 12 before they show you a video of me in minecraft

2975
04:01:10,280 --> 04:01:12,760
I don't know. This is what you want me to say. This is an 18 plus stream

2976
04:01:19,420 --> 04:01:21,719
Oh, yeah, yeah

2977
04:01:21,719 --> 04:01:33,069
God damn x rated no x rated the r rated r is not rated x rated r is rated r

2978
04:01:42,399 --> 04:01:49,799
Oh man, what the fuck is a germa? I don't know man. It's me

2979
04:01:51,659 --> 04:01:56,280
It's me

2980
04:01:56,280 --> 04:01:58,280
All right. I am going to get out of here

2981
04:02:00,040 --> 04:02:05,739
Immediately my whole body hurts. I'm in so I am like actually in like physical pain

2982
04:02:07,319 --> 04:02:11,879
Three vr days in a row is not so I don't don't I don't think that's a good idea anymore

2983
04:02:14,170 --> 04:02:16,170
I'm okay though. I'm all right

2984
04:02:17,290 --> 04:02:24,649
I am gonna just run away right now. I'll see you guys on wait. What's today's date?

2985
04:02:26,489 --> 04:02:29,930
I'll see you guys on friday or saturday, probably saturday. We'll do saturday sunday

2986
04:02:30,649 --> 04:02:42,780
I'll see you guys on saturday do a raid. Oh, you know what? You know who I want to raid

2987
04:02:43,950 --> 04:02:47,870
I want to raid boxbox because boxbox rated the stream with like

2988
04:02:48,030 --> 04:02:52,909
4 000 people last week or the week four and I just fucking ignored it completely

2989
04:02:54,090 --> 04:02:58,729
It was like an absolute. I didn't even it was a total ignore. I didn't even know what happened

2990
04:03:00,319 --> 04:03:03,440
So it was like oh boxbox raid. Here it comes. I didn't even know

2991
04:03:04,479 --> 04:03:09,280
And i'm just sending uh, let's go back and say thanks for the raid from two weeks ago

2992
04:03:11,600 --> 04:03:13,600
Sing the raid song

2993
04:03:14,479 --> 04:03:17,840
Wow, you're a piece of shit. I don't how did I even miss it? I don't even know what I was doing

2994
04:03:18,799 --> 04:03:21,200
I felt so bad afterwards. I was like wait. No, that's

2995
04:03:22,239 --> 04:03:25,440
Boxbox is awesome. I mean there was like a lot of people too

2996
04:03:28,120 --> 04:03:33,239
They're playing team fight tactics if you're into that. I don't even know how it works. Oh, and i've tried to watch it before

2997
04:03:34,280 --> 04:03:38,760
It's just 10 enemies line up and then somebody presses the go button and they just run into each other

2998
04:03:38,840 --> 04:03:40,840
I don't know how it works. It's apparently it's hard

2999
04:03:42,829 --> 04:03:45,629
Team fight tactics not team fortress tactics

3000
04:03:52,059 --> 04:03:57,340
It's hard well, all right, I I liked I played uh, hearthstone battlegrounds i've come in first place 10 times

3001
04:03:58,219 --> 04:03:59,739
Yep, I did

3002
04:03:59,739 --> 04:04:02,780
By the way, i've come in fourth place or higher almost 100 times

3003
04:04:05,549 --> 04:04:07,549
I am currently rated about

3004
04:04:08,010 --> 04:04:09,290
3500

3005
04:04:09,290 --> 04:04:11,530
That's not bad for somebody that's bad at everything

3006
04:04:12,170 --> 04:04:14,809
But i'm not bad at everything. I just say that so then I can surprise you

3007
04:04:15,610 --> 04:04:20,200
Go say hello to boxbox

3008
04:04:20,200 --> 04:04:22,200
Thanks for watching everybody. I'll see you on probably saturday

3009
04:04:22,840 --> 04:04:26,120
We're gonna move away from vr

3010
04:04:26,120 --> 04:04:27,959
No, you are bad

3011
04:04:27,959 --> 04:04:30,360
Stay hydrated. Yeah, i'm gonna go get some water because the food take a bath

3012
04:04:31,000 --> 04:04:32,879
I need it

3013
04:04:32,879 --> 04:04:34,879
Have a great rest of your night everybody

3014
04:04:35,040 --> 04:04:38,170
See you in a few days

3015
04:04:38,170 --> 04:04:40,170
Good night
