1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:18,539
Hello. Hello. How are you? That's good. That's good. Good. I'm good.

2
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:31,719
709. You're late. It's 409, actually, in my part of the world. Also, I- you guys didn't turn your

3
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:38,420
clocks back? The second- we have a few daylight savings times. You have to go back- you fall

4
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:46,549
back 10 minutes. You guys didn't do that? Don't be- I- you didn't do that? I didn't? What are

5
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:55,020
you talking about? Yeah, it's fall back. No, that's not- sorry, it's- it's uh- it's simmer down.

6
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:10,420
Summer, like simmer down, right? By 10 minutes. Summer down. Yeah, the summer simmer down.

7
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:25,450
That's not funny. You need to be funny. I got a whole book of jokes, okay? The joke- I have a

8
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:31,420
joke book. No, you're not gonna find every- all right, you're not gonna find every single thing

9
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:37,420
I say funny. If you did, if you- okay, if you thought every single thing I said was funny,

10
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:45,420
I would feel like you would just blow and smoke up my ass. You know what I mean? You're not gonna

11
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,900
think everything I say is funny. Otherwise, you'd- you might just be blowing smoke up my ass.

12
00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:08,500
I have to tell you guys something. Um, I had an insane dream. Wild. This- this was wild. It was an

13
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:18,819
entire television show. It was a whole movie. It was fucked up. I- I'll tell- I'm gonna tell the

14
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:23,319
whole thing- I gotta try to remember it, though, because the thing about dreams is it- I wrote

15
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:34,819
the whole thing down. It's about, I don't know, I said like a full page long. And this one- I- you

16
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:38,979
guys are gonna think this one's funny because it has a really- it has a really interesting ending.

17
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:48,090
I will be- I'm gonna give you a warning here. It's disgusting. It's gross. It's really gross.

18
00:02:54,139 --> 00:02:58,139
But I'm- I'll tell- I want to wait till more people- do I want to wait till more people are here to-

19
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:03,020
so more people hear this? Or do I want less people to hear this? So it doesn't- you know,

20
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:07,819
people don't think I'm weird. You know what I mean? Should I wait for more people or less people?

21
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:19,770
But then I feel like- I'll tell it in a second. Let me explain what we're doing. Let me give you

22
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:25,900
the kind of lowdown of what's going on today. We're gonna play a game today called Later Alligator.

23
00:03:27,979 --> 00:03:35,139
Excuse me, Later Alligator. This is a kind of a puzzle slash point and click adventure game

24
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:40,500
with really cute interesting characters, I guess. It seems like- I mean, people have been requesting

25
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,340
this for a while. It's been requested for like a year. It's supposed to be really fun, just like

26
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:54,599
a chill game. We're gonna play it. If I get kind of over it and I'm done with it, I'm gonna play

27
00:03:54,599 --> 00:04:05,159
a game called Webbed. We're probably still gonna play Webbed. Webbed is apparently really fun.

28
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:11,349
It's time for you to do a lot of voices. I think- isn't the- it seems like it's voice acted.

29
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:22,470
Is the whole game voice acted? I thought so. What is better, alligator or crocodile? It's

30
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:30,220
a different animal. Stop doing that. Stop doing that. Ow, my hand. Look what happened.

31
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:40,810
I just hit my desk hard. What the fuck? We're gonna have 15 different Bernie Sanders voices today.

32
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:50,199
I don't know, are we? Is somebody gonna talk like this? Is there gonna be another character that

33
00:04:50,199 --> 00:05:04,899
talks like this? Yeah, probably will be a few. Do you want a barf drink or statue?

34
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:16,230
No, but I mean maybe. That sounds like kind of cool, maybe. Do you want one of those?

35
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:31,560
Do you like axolotls? Yeah, they're really cute. Please explain the birds and the bees. I'm really

36
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:39,529
confused by it. They're two animals. One of them's an insect. The other one's a bird that flies around.

37
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:48,199
The bees are literally gonna- that's how humanity ends, okay? The bees- you want to look into the

38
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:52,680
bees? Have we have issues here with the bees? That's how humanity ends. There's your birds

39
00:05:52,680 --> 00:06:03,689
and the bees. Once the bees are gone, we're all dead. Don't you get it? When the bees are gone,

40
00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:24,009
we are all dead. Wise words. Save the bees. What about the mosquitoes? Fuck the mosquitoes.

41
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:32,379
Insect-tier list. Okay, do you guys want to hear a tidbit of information here?

42
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:37,589
Uh, mosquitoes are all the way below F-tier. They're the worst insect.

43
00:06:39,269 --> 00:06:46,100
Mosquitoes were part of the reason why I moved to Nevada. I was like, what's a part of the world

44
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:51,779
where I will never see one of those motherfucking mosquitoes ever again? Ever. I don't even- I

45
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:57,670
don't want to see them ever again. Nevada is one of those places where there just are no mosquitoes.

46
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:07,029
They do not exist. I would rather get stung in the mouth by a scorpion than be outside,

47
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:17,050
ever again, at like 6 30 p.m. in Massachusetts and look up and see the swarm of these bugs that just

48
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:26,730
want to suck all your blood out. That's kind of extreme. It is. I hate mosquitoes. Having to be

49
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:32,709
out there and to- look, look, let me show you. When you are outside and there's a place where

50
00:07:32,709 --> 00:07:38,550
there's a lot of mosquitoes but a really humid place. Does this remind you? Does this- are you

51
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:49,269
aware of this scenario? Yeah, so how's school? Yeah, no, it's cool. I think one of the big

52
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:59,000
problems I think with the school system- you just graduated? Yeah. Yep. I don't like doing that. I

53
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:07,000
don't like fucking doing that. I'm so glad I never have to do that again. And everybody is doing it.

54
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,209
Everybody in like the group of people outside are all doing it. It's not abnormal to see somebody

55
00:08:13,209 --> 00:08:21,029
just freak out and like reach elastic style around their back and be like, yeah, what time do you

56
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:27,829
guys want to go? If we want to get coffee, we probably should go at like six, maybe, maybe,

57
00:08:27,829 --> 00:08:34,500
maybe seven. It's like this is normal. I don't- I hate it. You're a hater. Yeah, I am a- I'm a

58
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:52,039
mosquito hater. That was based. Okay, take a look at this. Ah, this is later alligator.

59
00:08:52,679 --> 00:09:02,710
Do I talk about my dream now? Okay, this dream is fucking crazy. All right, let's- let me start.

60
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:10,539
Hold on. So I had a dream. I would tell you right now this is disgusting. This is a very gross

61
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:16,460
thing that happened. Your sideburns aren't even. I need a haircut. Sometimes when I shave,

62
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:23,289
I don't- I like- I fuck it up, all right? All right, this is actually a lot. That's really bad

63
00:09:23,289 --> 00:09:28,809
now that I look at it. That's like- that's pretty awful. It's like so full. I don't- but listen,

64
00:09:29,129 --> 00:09:35,620
I think it's- I think it's because I like went to- my hair has a weird growing pattern.

65
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:42,789
Is it that bad? All right, it is bad. But listen, my hair is a lot thinner here than it- look at

66
00:09:42,789 --> 00:09:49,830
how much thicker my hair is here. You see? It's really- I have really thick hair here and really

67
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:56,970
thin hair here. I didn't shave this. Look, see? It's- see how it's better now? Because like this

68
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:03,220
kind of- it thins out. You're reusing the sideburns bit. No, I just don't care when I shave.

69
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:10,200
I- when I go and get my haircut, they get it to where it needs to be. I just don't care. I

70
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,779
shave my face and I go, whatever, that's close enough. Whatever, that's close enough. I just

71
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:20,820
don't care. I don't care. Like this is fine, right? When I go get a haircut, they take care of that.

72
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:28,090
I don't care. I do the same thing. I can't be bothered. See? Some of you get it. I know you do.

73
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:38,740
Okay, so listen. It sticks out. It's because I haven't had a haircut. They go

74
00:10:41,299 --> 00:10:47,700
and they get rid of it. This is not worst hair. Stop that worst hair. I didn't do anything.

75
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:54,470
What the fuck are you talking about? My hair looks fine. My hair looks like good. Look at this. It's

76
00:10:54,470 --> 00:11:00,710
like smooth. It's silky. It's been conditioned. Just because I have sideburn hair does not make

77
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:04,710
it worst hair. I'm not even putting it on a- I'm not even making it a category this year. Good luck.

78
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,440
It looks greasy. It's- what do you mean greasy? It's- look at that. Could greasy hair do this?

79
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:57,669
Nope. It's not- how is it worst hair? You guys are fucked. Whatever. So I had this dream. I had a

80
00:11:57,669 --> 00:12:07,909
dream where I was- hold on. So I had this dream. This dream is crazy. I want to- I have to warn

81
00:12:07,909 --> 00:12:13,379
everybody here, seriously. I'm going to probably, like, this is going to gross people out. I had

82
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:23,179
this dream. Why is my mic peaking? It's not. Fix your settings. Fix your settings. There's nothing

83
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:35,720
wrong with my mic. Okay. So there's enough people here. Whatever. Is stalling? This is- what do you

84
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:48,809
mean stalling? You just did stun locks. Fine. Okay. So here- listen to me. This is really important.

85
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:59,740
I had this dream where me and Holly were on a road trip. This is like two different dreams that were

86
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:05,029
connected for no reason. So me and Holly were on a road trip. We were, like, driving somewhere.

87
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:14,940
And, you know, in dreams, stuff just gets kind of stitched together and you don't really know why.

88
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:23,769
Holly and I- fix your settings! I don't care. So Holly and I, we went on a road trip and we stopped

89
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:31,049
at, like, a gas station slash, um, a gas station slash- I can hear her laughing already. I already

90
00:13:31,049 --> 00:13:37,129
told her this, by the way. And she was disgusted, by the way. She was like, this is- this story is

91
00:13:37,129 --> 00:13:44,490
fucking disgusting. Like, I- she- I- she's heard the story already. So anyways, uh, we go to gas

92
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:51,980
station and we pull in and it's a car wash slash gas station. Okay, cool. So the idea was, okay,

93
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:55,019
we're gonna get out and, like, and they're gonna wash the car and whatever. I don't know why we

94
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:59,820
decided to go get a car wash, um, in the middle of a road trip to some friend's house or something.

95
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:04,860
So we get out of the car and it's like, okay, take the car. Sure, whatever. Go ahead, go for it.

96
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:10,539
Take it and wash it. And one of the workers- this guy had, like, a clipboard here. And I, like, went

97
00:14:10,539 --> 00:14:16,139
to go do something and Holly was, like, in the- kind of in the business or whatever. And this guy- I

98
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:21,340
don't know if he was, like, going to attack Holly. Like, I don't know why the employee was doing this.

99
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:26,220
Like, I come back out- I think it was, like, maybe I was outside for some reason. I come back in the

100
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:32,730
establishment and this guy's, like, going to, like, attack Holly. So I, like, got in the way

101
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:37,049
and I, like, fucking pushed the guy and he pushed me back and I, like, shoved him with the clipboard

102
00:14:37,049 --> 00:14:41,379
and this clipboard, like, hit him in the face and I started fighting this fucking guy. I was, like,

103
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:46,019
fucking punching him in the face and we were fighting, just fighting each other. And the whole

104
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:53,909
time we're- this car is at the car wash, right? So, okay, what- the car is, like, at the car wash.

105
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:58,230
Splash! We're gone. We're not in the car wash anymore. We're outside the car wash.

106
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:03,690
I don't know how it's stitched together. And we're looking for the car. And the whole time,

107
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:07,210
like, Holly and I are like, that guy was- what the fuck was that guy's problem? That guy was a piece

108
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:11,370
of shit. Yeah, I, like, kicked his ass. Like, I fucking beat him up. Whatever, right? So I

109
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:15,370
kicked this guy's ass. And we're looking around for the car. We can't find it. We don't know where it

110
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:20,730
is. Um, eventually we come to the termination after walking around the parking lot four or

111
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:29,110
five different times. The car is gone. The car's gone. Somebody stole the car, okay? Somebody

112
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:36,950
stole the car. It's just not there anymore. So we had to start walking to my friend's house,

113
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:45,370
whatever it was, we started walking. Who's Holly? Holly's my girlfriend. So we- we had to walk. As

114
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:52,330
we're walking down the sidewalk, whatever, some guy in, like, a trench coat and these, like, big,

115
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:57,289
like, sunglasses. He was wearing these huge sunglasses. Comes up to us. He's, like, walking

116
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:01,049
kind of next to us and we're like, what the fuck is going on? And this guy walks up to us and he

117
00:16:01,049 --> 00:16:08,539
goes, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, spray me in the face with this. And he hands Holly this, like, aerosol

118
00:16:08,539 --> 00:16:16,330
can to spray him in the face. So we're just like, I don't- I- oh, I mean, you're gonna leave us alone?

119
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:22,330
Just leave us alone. So the guy- the guy's sitting there just waiting for Holly to spray him in the

120
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:28,250
face. So she holds the nozzle up like this and is, like, pointing at him and she goes

121
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:34,490
and sprays herself. It was- the guy was- it was a prank. The guy turned the nozzle the other way

122
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:41,580
and she maced herself in the face and she's, like, and I'm, like, what the fuck just happened?

123
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:45,259
What the fuck? And the guy starts laughing. So I start fighting the guy. I, like, start- I'm,

124
00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:49,179
like, fucking- I fight this guy. I start punching this guy. I'm fighting this guy.

125
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:53,940
Like, I used to fight another person. I'm fighting another guy. Holly's over, like,

126
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,700
on the sidewalk with, like, these, like, welling up in her eyes. Like, I was like, I don't know

127
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:02,580
what the fuck it was. So I'm fighting this guy and we get to a point where, like, we're wrestling

128
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:07,059
around, like, fighting each other and there was a side- like, a drop down. We were on, like,

129
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:12,339
a sidewalk and there was a lip and then another sidewalk. Maybe, like, I don't know, maybe five

130
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:21,380
feet, six feet lower. This guy jumps down to, like, get down to the other sidewalk and I'm looking

131
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:25,380
down at him. He's only, like, remember, he's only, like, five or six feet below me and I'm, like,

132
00:17:26,259 --> 00:17:31,779
I'm gonna- fuck this. I know what to do. So I, like, falling R1 the guy. Like, that was gonna work

133
00:17:31,779 --> 00:17:38,180
in real life. So I, like, fall and, like, punch and I, like, punch him in the head and, like,

134
00:17:38,259 --> 00:17:43,299
I fucking get him. Like, I knock this dude out. Two of his friends are, like, coming over and I'm,

135
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:48,740
like, oh shit, this is bad. This is really bad and they're, like, oh yeah, fuck him. He's a fucking

136
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:54,500
asshole, man. I'm just, like, what? Like, all right. Flash again. This is where it gets weird. This is

137
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:59,029
where it gets really weird and I'm gonna warn everybody. This is where it gets gross. We are

138
00:17:59,029 --> 00:18:05,190
at our destination, right, after that happened. We get to the destination. We're at my friend's house

139
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:10,650
and I really have to go to the bathroom. Like, I could have been at that. Remember, this is a

140
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:16,569
gross story. Number two. So the bathroom is, like, I remember, like, this is stitched together in such

141
00:18:16,569 --> 00:18:22,259
a weird way. I don't know how it's stitched together. So we get there. I go to their bathroom

142
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:31,740
and their bathroom is a bedroom. It's like a bedroom. There's a toilet that's, like, five feet

143
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:37,500
tall. The bowl is, like, up here and it's, like, a bunch of porcelain going all the way down,

144
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:43,880
okay? So, all right, it's, like, this is, like, this is, why is your bathroom a fucking bedroom?

145
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:51,059
There's, like, a shelving thing over here. There's, like, a bed over there, too, and it's just,

146
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:58,099
like, weird, like, why is it like this? So, again, this is gross. So I get, like, up on this huge,

147
00:18:58,099 --> 00:19:02,740
like, high, it's, like, it was, like, a gigantic, like, high chair. It was, like, a big high,

148
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:06,660
that's all the way I can describe it. It was huge. Like, it was really high off the ground for no

149
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:15,140
reason. So I get over there, dude, I, this is gross. I take a huge shit, right? I take a

150
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:24,339
massive shit in this toilet and I'm done. Okay, that's it. I'm done. It's time now. It is time.

151
00:19:24,339 --> 00:19:28,579
I told you this was going to be gross. I warned you, like, five times. So, like, I flushed the

152
00:19:28,579 --> 00:19:35,000
toilet, whatever, and everything's fine, and I'm like, okay, it's time to, it's time to clean up,

153
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,759
right? So I look over at the material that you used to clean up, which is the toilet paper,

154
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:45,880
and there on this roll next to here was, like, right next to the toilet. The toilet paper roll

155
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:53,349
had this stain on it. It was a stain. You know what I mean? And I was just, like, I don't, uh-uh-uh,

156
00:19:53,349 --> 00:19:58,950
I don't think so. So I kind of rolled it a little bit and the stain was there still,

157
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:02,869
a little bit faded, still there, a little bit faded, still. I'm like, I don't want to use this.

158
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:11,109
I'm not using this. So I'm like, what the fuck do I do now? Oh, I know. There, over on the shelf,

159
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:19,049
on the shelf in this bedroom bathroom was, like, of various sizes and shapes, different toilet paper

160
00:20:19,049 --> 00:20:23,849
rolls. Like, some of them were kind of halfway undone. Some of them were wrapped up in, like,

161
00:20:23,849 --> 00:20:30,650
the hotel wrapping. So I'm like, all right, the hotel wrapping over there. I, I, that's,

162
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:34,490
that's the one. It's a fresh one. It's brand new, right? It's wrapped in, like, that, that hotel

163
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:42,069
wrapping. So I go, I, I, I start to go up to go to where the toilet paper is. But remember,

164
00:20:42,069 --> 00:20:45,509
I don't know why dreams are like this. Don't ask me why. Please don't ask me why. I don't,

165
00:20:45,509 --> 00:20:53,380
I can't describe why this happens. I was in the water, up to here, like, like a fucking jacuzzi.

166
00:20:54,470 --> 00:21:00,309
And I was, like, pushing up to get out of, like, the jacuzzi and, like, get, making it so my elbows

167
00:21:00,309 --> 00:21:06,470
were, like, on the bowl and, like, getting up because that's how I had to get out. So I finally

168
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:12,789
get up, I'm soaking wet and I'm, like, out of the toilet and I go over to grab this, like, I'm like,

169
00:21:12,789 --> 00:21:17,750
what the fuck am I gonna do? So I grab this, this wrapped toilet paper, fresh toilet paper roll.

170
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:22,789
Okay. I didn't fall in. I was apparently already in it. Dreams don't make any sense. I was

171
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:28,150
apparently already in this toilet and, like, up to here. Remember, this thing was, like, five feet

172
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:35,849
tall. So I, I get out, I unwrap the new toilet paper and there's a fucking huge stain on it.

173
00:21:35,849 --> 00:21:41,130
It's a huge stain. Again, I was like, this doesn't make any sense. Something with the manufacturing

174
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:45,849
this shit. What happened? This doesn't make any sense. Why is it like this? I don't get it. What

175
00:21:45,849 --> 00:21:53,130
the fuck? So I can't use this roll either. So I put that down. I, I go over the, again, there are

176
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:58,410
tons of, there's, like, five different rolls on a shelf over here and I grab one of them. That's,

177
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:04,779
like, kind of halfway done. But this toilet paper roll was, like, antique. It was falling apart in

178
00:22:04,779 --> 00:22:09,579
my hands. Like, I would unroll it and it was, like, crumbling out, like, like, as if it was, like,

179
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:17,430
antique. I was like, I can't fucking use this either. What the hell is going on? So eventually,

180
00:22:18,069 --> 00:22:24,519
eventually, I get to a roll that I have in my hand and I'm like, this looks pretty good.

181
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:28,200
There's nothing on it. There's no stains on it. It's not, like, weird crumbling in my hands,

182
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:33,259
antique bullshit. I start to, like, get it over to where, remember, I just crawled out of the toilet.

183
00:22:33,259 --> 00:22:39,740
I get over to where the toilet is and, like, it's kind of, like, oddly heavy. So I, the toilet paper

184
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:44,460
roll kind of unrolls a little bit and then it unravels and hits the ground and starts rolling

185
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:52,869
on the ground. And there is rolled up in the toilet paper, like, 30 to 40 thousand fucking

186
00:22:52,869 --> 00:22:58,549
dollars. It was where this person was, like, hiding money in their house. It was, like,

187
00:22:58,549 --> 00:23:04,549
they were hiding money here, hiding it. I was like, oh my god, no, what the fuck? There was,

188
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:09,990
like, a hidden money spot in your house? What the fuck? So I try to, and then this is all this money.

189
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:13,910
There was, like, other, like, little antique shit in here, right? There was, like, little antiques

190
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:17,269
in it. There were, like, little trinkets, like, wrapped up in the money that was wrapped in the

191
00:23:17,269 --> 00:23:23,509
toilet paper. So I start picking up these, like, this bundle of, like, just, like, it's rolled up

192
00:23:23,509 --> 00:23:28,150
money. It was, like, rolled like this. And I don't know what to do with it because no matter what I

193
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:33,750
did, this was going to, I would never make it look the same way, right? Like, holy shit, man, this

194
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:37,990
was wrapped up so perfectly. It's going to be a mess. They're going to know that I did that,

195
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:43,769
right? They're going to know that something happened. So this is one. This dream is your

196
00:23:43,769 --> 00:23:50,250
internal struggle with money and greed. Well, I'm not done. It gets worse. So eventually,

197
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:54,970
like, this unwrapped money, I, like, put it back on the shelf. It's all fucking crumpled up and

198
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:58,809
all fucked up looking. So there's no way I did, there's no way I didn't touch it, okay?

199
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:06,779
Finally, I get a piece of toilet paper, like, a roll that is fine and it works. I bring it over

200
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:16,339
and I realize that there's a gigantic window directly across from the fucking toilet,

201
00:24:16,339 --> 00:24:23,779
like a huge bay window. And I was like, whoa, what the fuck? Somebody could have seen this.

202
00:24:23,779 --> 00:24:28,019
What the, somebody could see me walking around like this. And like, who's, could anybody see,

203
00:24:28,019 --> 00:24:30,900
why would you have a window like this? Why would you have a huge bay window here? What the fuck is

204
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:36,019
wrong with you? What are you, what's fucking wrong with you? So boom, I wake up. I wake up

205
00:24:36,019 --> 00:24:43,559
and I'm lying in bed and I open my eyes and after this insane dream, I thought I shit my pants.

206
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:47,559
I thought there was shit in my, in my, like, asshole in my ass cheeks. So I'm sitting there

207
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:53,559
going, I shit my pants. Like, there's shit in my ass. So this is real life. Like, I'm lying there

208
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:59,000
in real life going like, yup, yeah, this, I, there's, I shit, there's shit here. I felt it.

209
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,480
I knew it. I was certain about it. So I get out of bed and I, like, waddle over, like, slowly.

210
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:11,349
This is the slowest I've ever gotten out of bed. And I walk over towards the bathroom and I go,

211
00:25:11,349 --> 00:25:18,900
and I, like, go to get the toilet paper. And guess what? There ain't no toilet paper in there.

212
00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:27,579
So, so I waddle across the fucking house, just like, god damn it, no, it can't be real.

213
00:25:27,579 --> 00:25:33,019
And I waddle across the fucking house and I get, go to where the toilet paper is. And I get into,

214
00:25:33,019 --> 00:25:37,579
I get into a private place and I, like, do what I need to do and I wipe my ass

215
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:46,549
and it's clean. There's nothing there. There's absolutely nothing there. It was fucking nothing

216
00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:51,579
happened. And this probably, I probably, I probably, like, slowly walked around the house like I had

217
00:25:51,579 --> 00:25:55,819
shit in my pants for, like, probably five minutes. Maybe, like, two, you know what, no, that's a lie.

218
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:04,500
Maybe, like, two or three minutes total. But still, that's, like, so long. And then I left and I was

219
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:11,609
like, well, that was fucking wild. And I had a wicked bad headache. I had a wicked bad headache

220
00:26:11,609 --> 00:26:15,829
and I kind of still do. I don't know, man, like, I just have these dreams that just become so

221
00:26:15,829 --> 00:26:24,200
fucking strange. And that was it. And I was like, oh, that was, like, ridiculous. And I wrote this

222
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:31,670
all down too. I remember, Holly was, like, out here, like, in her office working. And I was just,

223
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:36,950
like, it was, like, wicked early in the morning. Like, she was up working. And I was just, like,

224
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:43,130
I, like, walked kind of by her and I was like, hey, hi. Like, I probably looked wicked fucked up.

225
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:52,579
And she can literally attest to this. Like, this, this is real. I was, like, slowly walking by,

226
00:26:52,579 --> 00:26:59,140
just like, hey, hey, yeah, I'm just, like, getting up. It was fucking wild. And I had to write this

227
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:09,160
whole thing down. I thought I should, I thought I should the bed. Because I thought, like, oh,

228
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:13,880
my God. Okay, I got to be careful because I don't, I, like, in my brain, I was going over every

229
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:20,420
single scenario, like, I hope don't come in, don't, do not come into the bedroom. Do not go in the

230
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:25,319
bedroom. Because, like, I may have shit the bed. Like, but how do you say that to somebody? Oh,

231
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:30,279
hey, um, hey, I just, like, woke up and I'm in, like, kind of a daze. But I may, I may have shit

232
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:40,970
the bed. Don't go in there. Somebody said TMI. I told you, I warned you over and over again.

233
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:45,690
This is a gross story. This is not, this didn't happen. This is not a real story. Let me be,

234
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:54,500
look, that didn't happen. This was in the dream. Oh, this music. This music should not have been

235
00:27:54,500 --> 00:28:03,539
on this whole time. But I don't, okay, I don't know what it is about why our brains do this weird

236
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:13,180
shit to us. But when I woke up from that dream, I, I shit my pants. Like, I did. I felt it. You

237
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:19,460
know what I mean? Like, it was like, oh, no, no, no, this is bad. This really happened. I really

238
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:26,519
thought it happened. I actually really did. But why? Why does my brain want to do that? Why does

239
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:31,559
my brain feel like, oh, hey, by the way, I need to tell you something. Like, you really did that.

240
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:35,240
But like the first minute that you're up, I'm sitting there, I was lying on my back.

241
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:43,779
I'm lying on my back just going, oh, no, oh, no, this is not good. What do I do about this?

242
00:28:43,779 --> 00:28:48,759
What am I supposed to do about this? It was like so much internal panic, like through that entire,

243
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:55,480
like I, I don't know, I fought like two or three people. I thought I shit my pants. You

244
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:05,160
just stopped doing DMT. I don't, I don't do anything. Anyways, we're going to play Later

245
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:17,799
Alligator. And the fact that I was in the toilet, why was I in the water? OK, I know that like the

246
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:21,319
people have like dream journals and people are like, oh, this is why you had that dream. I don't,

247
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:25,559
OK, if I told like somebody that was like a dream journal specialist or whatever that dream,

248
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:29,880
they probably would be like, you made that up. Like that's, that doesn't happen. I don't know

249
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:37,529
what the fuck is wrong with you. I have no idea what's wrong with you. This game is, OK, here we go.

250
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:53,450
Release the Armin Audition tape. That's what Holly just said. I'm not doing that. Not right now.

251
00:29:53,450 --> 00:30:05,369
I'll do that before I like, I retire. And remember, this is important too. I know that like,

252
00:30:05,369 --> 00:30:08,650
sure, me and Holly have a great relationship, right? And like, it's, it's very wonderful.

253
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:15,960
I like, it's a great relationship. It's fantastic. But like, it, I, I don't want to, I still like,

254
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:22,039
don't want to like fart like loud in front of her. So the prospect of, I may have shit the bed,

255
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:28,569
honey. It's like, whoa, you went from like, you are farting in front of your girlfriend to

256
00:30:28,569 --> 00:30:34,890
you shit the bed. That's too hot. That's way too much. That's too fast. I'm gonna slow that down,

257
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:40,650
right? You're gonna slow way that, slow way down. What's an alligator? It's a dinosaur that made it

258
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:54,660
through the meteor, OK? Here we go. You guys ready? So this is Later Alligator. It's a puzzle game

259
00:30:54,660 --> 00:31:05,670
and we're gonna have a great time playing. You and I. No company, please, thank you. OK? Latte

260
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:15,529
machine. Two earbuds? I thought about it. No, um, no ablo ingles, no ablo espanol, no ablos at all.

261
00:31:15,529 --> 00:31:28,329
Not even one ablo. What's going on here? 48 puzzles! Do I have a knife? There's no voice acting? I

262
00:31:28,329 --> 00:31:34,759
think there is. They said there's a voice volume indicator. Hey, I'm trying to lay low here, so

263
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:42,380
maybe can you move on, please? OK? OK? You got me. I'll come clean. Sorry for being so rude before.

264
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:45,819
I am just a little, well, I'm turning the cam off for this. I'm just a little on edge.

265
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:51,109
Normally I wouldn't tell anyone this, but you've got such soulful eyes that I can totally see the

266
00:31:51,829 --> 00:31:58,519
eternity of. So I feel safe with you, stranger. You see, usually I love coming to John Johnny's

267
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:04,779
on my birthday like this. Staying in the hotel, floating in the pool, eating two bagels at the

268
00:32:04,779 --> 00:32:09,339
Continental Breakfast, eating two soaps in the complimentary bath basket. Ooh. Why did I say

269
00:32:09,339 --> 00:32:17,289
ooh? Ugh. I just burped. But this year I've got a problem. A real problem. A real, real, big,

270
00:32:18,009 --> 00:32:22,490
problem. The thing is, I'm pretty sure the family is finally trying to rub me out for squealing.

271
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:27,430
I didn't mean to squeal, honest. I just see a pair of earnest eyes and the secrets just start

272
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:35,529
flowing out of my snoot. See? I'm doing it right now. Oh, cheese and crackers. What am I going to

273
00:32:35,529 --> 00:32:41,079
do? I don't want to be rubbed out. Two Tantona even told me I have to meet him upstairs here at

274
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:46,890
H Sharp for the event. They think I don't know, but I heard him talking to Big Mama on the phone.

275
00:32:47,529 --> 00:32:51,849
Well, family's going to come to really show me how it's done. What am I going to do? I don't want

276
00:32:51,849 --> 00:32:55,690
to sleep with the fishes. I have shell physiology and I have my asthma accent when I get too

277
00:32:55,690 --> 00:33:00,730
waterlogged. Wait a second. You're interested in me, right? You wanted to sit with me for

278
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:06,069
breakfast and everything. Do you think that you could help me? Since we're such great pals,

279
00:33:06,069 --> 00:33:11,369
you could go out and talk to my family around Alligator, New York City. Find out information

280
00:33:11,369 --> 00:33:16,170
about the event and report back to me. Yes, that's a great idea. Together, maybe we can collect

281
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:23,430
enough info to save me. You want to save me, right? Right? Great. I'll text you if I need

282
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:32,500
any help. How about you go there and start? Do you have a watch? Oh, you do? Great. I'll text a

283
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:37,619
little before 10 a.m. since it can take 15 minutes or so to get back here on the trolley. Make sure

284
00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:42,420
you check your watch a bunch. If you happen to get stuck doing some weird game-like activities

285
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:47,619
while investigating, it could take time. I don't have because I'm going to have to, I'm going to

286
00:33:47,619 --> 00:33:53,740
have to, I'm going to have a murder done on me. I'm okay. Think of the beach, Pat. Remember what

287
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:59,380
Dr. Duples knew to you. Anyways, thank you for helping me out like an alligator might be. I feel

288
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:04,200
like I'm just, I'm better just looking at your super kind invincible face. And be careful out

289
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:10,469
there. The last thing we need is two people sleeping with the fishes. We need to find a double bed in

290
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:24,650
this economy. See you later, friend. Stay safe. Ah, cam off. Hello, esteemed guest. If you're

291
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:28,090
looking to leave the restaurant, you'll have to use the exit arrow up in the corner of the screen.

292
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:34,820
We provide all our patrons with an exit arrow and complimentary pillow mint.

293
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:39,900
Feel free to use both outside of our fine establishment to exit and munch as you wish.

294
00:34:40,539 --> 00:34:45,670
Just don't mix the two up since that arrow is vintage and known to contain harmful materials

295
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:51,110
such as lead paint, asbestos, and a combination of rat poisons and cilantro. Please feel free to

296
00:34:51,110 --> 00:35:02,059
visit us again here at John Johnny's and have a Johnny of a day. What's up? Okay, that's his cute.

297
00:35:03,219 --> 00:35:10,579
This is John Johnny's Cafe. New voice unlocked. Cilantro. Ew, cilantro tastes like soap! Shut up.

298
00:35:11,219 --> 00:35:24,889
It is gross though. I love it. Hey, bub. Got a minute? Or perhaps three minutes? I ain't above

299
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:31,000
asking for five. I saw you walking out of John Johnny's over there and I said to myself,

300
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,780
Vicki, you gotta talk to that mysterious stranger. Vision and pinstripes, says. I ain't

301
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:41,739
trying to fluff you up or another, but you look like an alligator of exceptional taste. As well

302
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:45,900
as one who might like to dabble in high stakes games of chance and intrigue, if you feel me.

303
00:35:46,539 --> 00:35:51,829
Oh, don't actually feel me. I got a skin condition. They call me slick for a reason. According to my

304
00:35:51,829 --> 00:35:56,869
doc, it ain't going away unless I start using that topical cream at night. I gotta listen to

305
00:35:56,869 --> 00:36:02,070
some jabroni with a smarty certificate, you know what I'm saying? All my spots on the street.

306
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:10,760
This is also where I got this skin condition and my impolite lower back tattoo. Whom? What about the

307
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:18,889
event? Oh, you know about the event? Ah, look. Well, here, bub, it's a real secret affair, you dig?

308
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:24,090
Ain't nobody supposed to be going and telling Pat about it. My lips are sealed just like they

309
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:30,900
seal when I wake up after a night of nose only breathing. Hey, who's Pat? You talking about Pat,

310
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:35,940
the alligator? Yeah, I know that dude pretty well. You see, yeah, he's my second cousin.

311
00:36:36,659 --> 00:36:42,739
One time when we was kids, those guys got locked out of CCD after recess and missed juice and

312
00:36:42,739 --> 00:36:47,619
cookie time. We only had one granola bar between us and good old Pat gave me the bigger half.

313
00:36:48,809 --> 00:36:56,329
I'll always remember that. No, I ain't crying. I just spit in my own eyes as a display of my street

314
00:36:56,329 --> 00:37:06,099
toughness. Name's Mickey, but everyone, you know, calls me the old king of the cops.

315
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:10,420
Well, that one guy did before he yelled at a fence to stop stealing his email password

316
00:37:11,139 --> 00:37:18,219
and his pants fell down and he fell down into an open manhole. But I have it on good authority

317
00:37:18,219 --> 00:37:23,019
from the paramedics that he only called three or five other people that. So by the way,

318
00:37:24,059 --> 00:37:31,530
the old card king at your service. Oh, maybe no, just maybe if you play a little game with Mickey

319
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:37,670
here, my lips might loosen up a little. You can keep an eye on this flurry of fingies and find the

320
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:46,420
queen. Yeah. All right. Keep an eye three card Mickey. Yes, let's do it. Mickey's running a

321
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:51,719
street scam. Keep an eye on the queen and pick the correct card to foil his plans. All right,

322
00:37:51,719 --> 00:37:59,130
keep an eye on the queen. All right. Get your peepers peeled because these hands are about

323
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:03,480
to become a hurricane. I can't voice act on camera. I have to do it behind the scenes.

324
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:10,260
See here. Keep your eyes on the lady. Where is she going to go? Where is she going to go?

325
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:24,150
I got it. It was easy. Oh, but oh, don't be feeling too bad. Ain't nobody can.

326
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:26,869
What? Wait, what happened? That wasn't even looking.

327
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:32,860
Ain't nobody can hold a candle to Mickey's slick hands and catch fire from the mystery grease.

328
00:38:33,659 --> 00:38:43,980
Maybe I should start using that cream. I wasn't even looking. I actually, I actually wasn't even

329
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:50,010
looking. I was looking over here at you guys in the chat. I'll give you the win. Mickey ain't made

330
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:54,869
of stone. He's made of a series of tubes filled with a mysterious substance that may or may not

331
00:38:54,869 --> 00:39:14,329
be slightly corrosive. What? I won? I did it. Oh, geez. Anyways, about the event. Well, yeah.

332
00:39:15,289 --> 00:39:18,969
Ain't heard it from me, but I hear it's going to be a real affair to remember.

333
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:23,929
The whole family's been talking about it for months. That's really going to get here. You

334
00:39:23,929 --> 00:39:29,130
know what I'm saying? Anyways, thanks for playing. Let me know if you need any of my city smarts

335
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:33,610
while you're out here, rookie. Try not to lick any trolley handrails if you can help.

336
00:39:34,329 --> 00:39:44,599
Those dermatology copays are real kicking the alligator pants. You feel me? Oh, that was fun.

337
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:51,000
I did it. Trolley ain't here yet, so why don't you use go check out the arcade? Mickey got banned

338
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:57,210
for his slick fingers gumming up the machines and causing an epidermis epidemic. That ain't mean.

339
00:39:57,210 --> 00:40:08,820
You got to suffer the same fate. Oh, say Goku. Oh, that was cute. Okay. Click and drag up and

340
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:17,139
down. Oh, all right. Where should I go from here? The arcade? What time is it? It's 8 30. I got to

341
00:40:17,139 --> 00:40:24,840
be my what animal am I? Oh, I'm an alligator. I'm an alligator. All right. Where's the, uh,

342
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:36,280
where's the arcade? Go. Who is it? Um, hello. Is this by chance your first time in alligator

343
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:44,010
New York City? I mean, in the city city, not alligator Long Island or something. Who's this?

344
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:49,929
I thought so. Oh, you don't know me. I'm sorry if that's weird. I just thought if you'd like,

345
00:40:49,929 --> 00:40:56,090
I could text you some tips. City is really big and has a lot of colorful secrets that I wouldn't want

346
00:40:56,090 --> 00:41:02,309
you to miss on your first visit. Is it okay if I help you out from time to time? Lose this number.

347
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:10,820
Leave me the fuck alone. Oh, great. I'll be sure to text you again soon. Don't forget to enjoy

348
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:22,599
yourself. Okay. Oh, what's the street street kiter too? I got to play these. I just got a puzzle

349
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:36,280
piece. What's that? I got it. All right, let's go. Sweet Geraldine. Hey, up there in long arms. I'll

350
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:43,340
be back. Hey, up there in long arms. You got a sec? Nice suit. What's a fancy reptile like you

351
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:48,860
doing at the back of the arcade? I know what you're after. That's right. I've got you just by looking

352
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:54,940
at you. You want cold hard plush. Oh, you find the right alligator. And I've got a job that'll pay

353
00:41:54,940 --> 00:42:00,619
for both of our retirements and poorly made stuffies. Auto. You might see a humble claw machine,

354
00:42:00,619 --> 00:42:05,349
but this is a fault and we're going to break in. We can't just walk in. No, there's countermeasures.

355
00:42:05,909 --> 00:42:10,070
Sometimes, normally the security guard comes by and says, I'm not allowed to put my con

356
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:14,940
chair into the aisle. Without the boost, I'm not tall enough to work the cloth.

357
00:42:15,659 --> 00:42:19,429
He says it's a fire hazard, but most of the machines in here are. You see behind here,

358
00:42:19,429 --> 00:42:25,719
that's one hailing power strip juicing up every one of these babies. One wrong move and pinball

359
00:42:25,719 --> 00:42:30,119
and boom. This place lights up like my chemistry teacher's hair when I turned that Bunsen burner

360
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:39,480
too high. What? What the fuck? What do you know about the event? I love to tell you about the

361
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:43,880
event. I really would. But this is our first time on the job to get a Mac. You haven't yet earned

362
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:52,519
my unbridled trust. Okay. What about Pat? Pat is a Patsy, but not my Patsy. That's for sure.

363
00:42:52,519 --> 00:42:58,280
It's related to some of my dad's friends. One time at dad's show, Pat pulled the fire alarm

364
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:02,360
because he thought someone was trying to set him on fire. Turns out he just had a warm piece of

365
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:06,840
pizza in his pocket. No one could find him for almost an hour until the firefighters pulled him

366
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:11,980
out of the concert hall's crawlspace. He was covered in spiders and had eaten the pizza,

367
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:21,139
but was otherwise unharmed physically anyway. That guy's pretty weird. That was fun voice acting

368
00:43:21,139 --> 00:43:25,980
for like five minutes. All right, let's go. Me, I'm known around these parts as sweet Geraldine,

369
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:29,739
criminal mastermind of the claw machine. You haven't heard of me? Honestly, I'm not surprised.

370
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:36,329
I leave no fingerprints and Johnny Law doesn't have a clue. Or Johnny Boyer from my geography

371
00:43:36,329 --> 00:43:43,000
class. At least that's what he said when I asked him to spring fling. Okay, so what do we have to do?

372
00:43:43,719 --> 00:43:48,409
Maybe we can come to a mutually beneficial arrangement. Claw machine, it's a two man

373
00:43:48,409 --> 00:43:52,409
operation. I need someone who's not going to rat me out for additional prizes when plush comes to

374
00:43:52,409 --> 00:44:05,530
shove. You feel me? Low effort streamer. What do you say, old timer? One last claw machine

375
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:18,150
score. The big one. All right, let's go. Let's do it. Follow sweet Geraldine's instructions to get

376
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:23,349
the perfect claw machine prize. Click left and right to control the crane. When you're ready to

377
00:44:23,349 --> 00:44:35,530
grab, click the center button. What do you mean? Here she is, the big quesadilla, the motherlode.

378
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:40,260
Inside this vault is a treasure trove of prizes. I've had my eye on a couple of choice goods,

379
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:45,780
but I need an accomplice with nerves of steel and hands of steel. A tall patsy like you can

380
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:50,659
push the buttons and see the prizes. So what do you say? Let's get some cute loots for our cute

381
00:44:50,659 --> 00:44:56,739
snoots. First, you should warm up your tricky digits. Grab me any prize that catches your eye.

382
00:44:56,739 --> 00:45:18,739
Go on, old timer. Show me what you got. I'm going for the candy. Right there? I want this. Got it.

383
00:45:18,739 --> 00:45:24,139
I heard a prize. Let's check the slot. Oh, my dad says I'm not supposed to have too much candy

384
00:45:24,139 --> 00:45:28,949
because I get hyperactive and prone to fits of father pinching. But I think he just likes

385
00:45:28,949 --> 00:45:37,610
keeping it all for himself. All right. I got it first try. I got it. Real job begins. How will

386
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:41,849
you react when the pressure's on? This time you follow my lead. And you give me that seashell. I

387
00:45:41,849 --> 00:45:53,030
think it's pretty. What's seashell? Oh, which one? There's two. There's three. They're all the same,

388
00:45:53,030 --> 00:46:09,300
right? A little bit more. That'll get it. You got one. What is it? I wonder if I'll hear the ocean

389
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:23,269
if I put this to my ear. It said glacial melt is changing ocean currents. Whoa, dude. You're really

390
00:46:23,269 --> 00:46:26,869
good at this, but it's finally time for the big score. I can see it in your eyes. You're ready

391
00:46:26,869 --> 00:46:33,420
to get the ultimate prize. Get me the doll from the best, most awesome video game franchise of

392
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:38,699
all time, Final Friends City. He's the dreamy one with the spiky hair. This is it. The big one.

393
00:46:43,269 --> 00:46:58,139
Which one? This one here? This one? Can't move it. It's gotta be that one, right? No, I'm not

394
00:46:58,139 --> 00:47:09,369
gonna be able to get that one. You gotta go for this one. Stop moving. Stop. Is it puzzle piece?

395
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:28,170
Where? Oh, shit, there is. All right. Give me that. Oh, I fucked it up. The Onimon anime is a

396
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:32,409
bazillion years old and only weird grownups remember it. I bet you'd only get the reference

397
00:47:32,409 --> 00:47:39,980
of it being here at all if you were totally an old person. I want that puzzle piece. Give me the

398
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:48,260
doll from the best, most awesome video game franchise. I think I screwed it all up. I don't

399
00:47:48,260 --> 00:48:00,920
think I can get it. I have to clear this out, right? Piderman, you know, from that obscure internet

400
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:12,090
cartoon. Popcorn? Blue bullet, maybe. I'm Bobman. I'm Piderman. Here's another quarter. Could you

401
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:18,019
try again, please? I want the puzzle piece. Wait, I gotta make sure I can get it first try. I might

402
00:48:18,019 --> 00:48:30,170
be able to get it here. Batman, Piderman. Do I go straight down through here? Through the middle?

403
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:44,440
I think I'll get it. That's it, right? Wow. Dirt. Wait, did you put dirt in there? I only have two

404
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:52,869
more chances. I think I might be out of luck here. I have to make sure I can get this one. Let me try

405
00:48:52,869 --> 00:49:08,010
to... What? Did you get the... Oh, no, I didn't. Yikes. Even looking at this guy is like walking

406
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:14,630
under a bazillion ladders or yeeting a shattered mirror into hyperspace. Wait, I can get this one

407
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:23,670
over here. This one over here. I got it. Can the claw go that far, though? I don't think it can.

408
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:35,000
I think I just lost. Oh, I got it. I got the puzzle. You can have this. I get the feeling

409
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:43,849
it'll come in handy later. I got it. That's a Nintendo Switch sound. Bad news, old timer.

410
00:49:43,849 --> 00:49:55,449
That was my very last quarter. I'll retry in 30 minutes. Oh, it makes... I thought it was timed

411
00:49:55,449 --> 00:50:06,179
out. Okay, 30 minutes is gonna go by. I get it. All right, let's go. Oh, I got it. I got it. I got

412
00:50:06,179 --> 00:50:16,949
it. That's the punishment. All right, any prize. Doesn't matter. Let's just get one. What's this one?

413
00:50:16,949 --> 00:50:27,179
Try to get the key, too. A big edie bar. They stopped making these in the 90s. This is just

414
00:50:27,179 --> 00:50:32,539
like when my science class dug up fossils. But when I found my old retainer under several strata

415
00:50:32,539 --> 00:50:47,380
layers of anime wall scrolls. What? I want the ducky. The key is gone. How am I supposed to get

416
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:58,869
the ducky? What's this anime? There's only one ducky in here. Is this one easier to get or is

417
00:50:58,869 --> 00:51:04,760
this one easier to get? Probably this one. There it is. Got it. Thank you. Thank you.

418
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:13,579
Last year at recess, this girl in my class, Chrissy Baraducci, she got her snoot stuck in

419
00:51:13,579 --> 00:51:18,789
a hole near the swing set that was full of bees. Anyway, she looked kind of like this after. So,

420
00:51:18,789 --> 00:51:29,800
I think I'll give it to her as a gift for her beeversary. Okay, you're ready for the ultimate

421
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:35,559
surprise. The doll from. Okay, the spiked haired. Okay, there it is. Should I get the key?

422
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:51,719
I get the key. No, I don't want Batman. Batman, I haven't seen this guy in a while. I come over

423
00:51:51,719 --> 00:52:03,510
the house. What? I know you want the doll, but I want the key. Just smash the glass and take it.

424
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:31,000
What the fuck? It's gone. All right, whatever. I need to get it. One more try. Just go one,

425
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:37,369
two, three, go. Okay, I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done.

426
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:50,710
I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I don't want to mess it up. I can't. An hour can't

427
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:56,570
go by. I got to do these mini games. It's like 50 mini games. I got to do them all or a reasonable

428
00:52:56,570 --> 00:53:11,340
amount of them to complete the games program. Right here. Got it. Those sounds are so loud.

429
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:17,019
Oh, jeez. I can't believe you got the dreamiest anime game boy from Final

430
00:53:17,019 --> 00:53:22,469
Friend City, Claude Stripes. Claude, his hair is almost as prickly as his social interactions

431
00:53:22,469 --> 00:53:33,349
with women. This is exactly what I wanted. Thank you so much for helping me. Claude. Okay.

432
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:37,429
I can't believe the big score. Thanks to you, we had a clean getaway.

433
00:53:38,389 --> 00:53:46,119
Family member badge. All right, go. I'll tell you what you need to know. The event is a secret.

434
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:51,719
I'm a gator, not a rat. It's a birthday party. It's a birthday party. It's literally a birthday

435
00:53:51,719 --> 00:53:56,360
party. It's a surprise birthday party and everyone's invited and he thinks he's going

436
00:53:56,360 --> 00:54:00,889
to get killed or something. This is a birthday party. That's the birthday party. That's right,

437
00:54:00,889 --> 00:54:09,079
a classic double cross. That's the calling card of sweet Geraldine master criminal. All right.

438
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:17,960
What else we got here? Joanne. Oh, Joanie. Hey there. You up for a real challenge?

439
00:54:18,679 --> 00:54:21,880
I haven't seen you here before, stranger. Alligator New York City is a big place,

440
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:26,840
but we tend to have regulars, you know? Little Rocco and Bonnie over there. Those two are here

441
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:36,940
every day, but you, I remember such a visible face like yours. Look at me being a real jerk.

442
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:40,219
I don't mean to be giving you a hard time or nothing. I've just been a little frazzled since

443
00:54:40,219 --> 00:54:46,300
last night. I had a dream that I was a ski ball and some sticky fingered kid kept throwing me

444
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:52,389
into the 10 point hole. Over the 50, dingus, I tried to yell, but being a ball and all,

445
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:56,969
ding dong couldn't hear me. I woke up in a cold sweat in my kitchen, systematically throwing

446
00:54:56,969 --> 00:55:01,079
individual oranges from the window into my neighbor's terrarium. Vitamin C would have

447
00:55:01,079 --> 00:55:04,599
helped me shake it off, but all I had for breakfast was black coffee and a half a can

448
00:55:04,599 --> 00:55:12,170
leftover candy cigarettes. Well, I got a dream for you. How much time do you have? How much time do

449
00:55:12,170 --> 00:55:17,349
you have? All right. What is the event? Look, I know you're here spying for Pat for whatever

450
00:55:17,349 --> 00:55:21,909
reason. That's fine, but I can't tell you family secrets. You feel me? If you haven't been filled

451
00:55:21,909 --> 00:55:25,739
that hot, you'd have to really impress me. All right, let's go. What do you want me to do?

452
00:55:26,539 --> 00:55:46,360
It smelled weird. It was a dumb kid. All right. Pat's my cousin and also the most genuine doof I

453
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:55,420
know. So you better be nice to him, you hear? He smelled it. I don't know. The thing that popped

454
00:55:55,420 --> 00:56:00,380
in my head was like the drain commercial with the guys puking. I wouldn't want to have to pop

455
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:06,440
you one. I'm told I got a mean left hook and a moderately insulting right hook. A kick that

456
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:11,639
could benefit from some anger management courses. I tried to sign up for some calming hot yoga

457
00:56:11,639 --> 00:56:18,679
at the YACA, but it didn't go over well. You ever get kicked by your own leg? It ain't great, bud.

458
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:26,840
It ain't great. My name's Joni or Bologna. If you're my fourth grade bully, come back to fight me.

459
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:35,690
You're not, right? Damn. Anyway, I work here at Adelaide's Arcade, sweeping floors and keeping

460
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:40,579
all the games running smooth as a baby's balmy behind. I used to work as a greaser in a shop

461
00:56:40,579 --> 00:56:45,219
downtown, but I left to be closer to my gaming hobby. But let me keep the leather jacket though

462
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:52,679
and the company hairstyle. All right, what are we doing? So what do you think? Can you roll the

463
00:56:52,679 --> 00:56:58,599
ball, old timer? I'm talking pinball, the old pinny B as I like to call it. It's the advice of both

464
00:56:58,599 --> 00:57:03,239
of my friends, family and the supportive therapist I see on Thursdays. I got the highest score on

465
00:57:03,239 --> 00:57:07,480
lizard wizards. You're eight months running, but I'm always looking for a real pinhead to

466
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:13,000
put my skills against. What do you say? Care to take on a pinball lizard like me? I didn't mean

467
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:21,820
to make a joke. I take this very, very seriously. All right, let's go. Pinball. When the ball is in

468
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:53,110
play control by clicking L and R or the keyboard, beat 5000 points. Absolutely simple. 5000. I'm

469
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:57,590
going to beat this right now. I literally just destroyed it. Has anybody played to beat your

470
00:57:57,590 --> 00:58:12,710
score? I just annihilated your score. It was, it was embarrassing. I think that's so stupid. I hate

471
00:58:12,710 --> 00:58:17,769
pinball machines should not have this. There should never be a way for it to fall down the

472
00:58:17,769 --> 00:58:23,530
left and right without you doing anything. Cause that's not user error. It's designed failure,

473
00:58:23,530 --> 00:58:26,650
which is like, come on, like that's stupid. I don't know what pinball machines should be like

474
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:43,340
completely redesigned. Mad because bad. You can't control that if it goes down there. There's

475
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:56,550
nothing you can do about it. What if I get a million points? El ballo. You can influence it.

476
00:58:56,550 --> 00:59:08,340
What? By like picking the machine up and turning it around? That's illegal. It's illegal. You can't

477
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:27,960
tell the pinball machine. You get thrown out. All right. I destroyed the score. You're the annoying

478
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:36,300
kid in the arcade spamming the buttons. What? Cause I like the sound. One of the most amazing

479
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:45,449
sound effects of all time. They go in this order, running water in a river and pinball flipper sound

480
00:59:46,170 --> 00:59:58,230
when you press the button. Number three would probably be, I gotta make sure I get this right.

481
01:00:01,989 --> 01:00:09,219
A perfect swish at a basketball hoop in that order. Opening a can of soda is probably number

482
01:00:09,219 --> 01:00:16,019
four or five. Hey, it's been a long time since I seen moves like that in front of the lizard wizards

483
01:00:16,019 --> 01:00:21,059
here. Got that ball hitting all the do what's and who's it so fast. I could barely keep up.

484
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:30,809
Releasing a big fart. No, that's not a great sound. That's like a gross sound. It's been a real honor

485
01:00:30,809 --> 01:00:34,650
to hang with us. Another student of the pinball arts. All right. I got a puzzle piece too.

486
01:00:35,610 --> 01:00:40,010
Well, the event now, this might be just a rumor, but word of the street, there's going to be some

487
01:00:40,010 --> 01:00:46,090
sick games there. It's a birthday party, not pinball per se, but you know, he can take what

488
01:00:46,090 --> 01:00:51,369
you can get. That's all I can really say. I'd better get back on the grind trying to beat my

489
01:00:51,369 --> 01:00:56,489
last high score. Thanks for showing me your supple wrist and head. Catch you later. All right. Let's

490
01:00:56,489 --> 01:01:10,090
go. Time is it. Hey, it's me, Pat, the alligator, one with the hat, iPad. It's almost 10 can

491
01:01:10,090 --> 01:01:16,539
you come back? Someone came over to my table and threatened me. Well, they gave me a coupon and

492
01:01:16,539 --> 01:01:25,980
told me to have a nice day, but that could mean anything. Nobody came to threaten me.

493
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:31,559
One free tomato soup, best in New York City. There's a coupon I got last week. If you come

494
01:01:31,559 --> 01:01:38,360
back, I'll give it to you. No questions asked. All right. So I gotta go back. Am I on like a time

495
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:56,219
limit? An actual time limit? I got some info. I don't bop me. Oh, it's just you, my new friend.

496
01:01:57,099 --> 01:02:00,619
Sorry, I saw your shadow over me. I thought some kind of restaurant assassin was descending

497
01:02:00,619 --> 01:02:12,090
from the rafters to take me out. It's a birthday party. Just do what everybody else fucking does.

498
01:02:12,809 --> 01:02:18,860
And you act surprised even though you know what it is. It's a birthday party. Relax. You're going

499
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:25,510
to walk in the door, you're going to walk in the door, you're going to go like the coat off, lights are going

500
01:02:25,510 --> 01:02:31,750
to come on and you're going to go like that. Just like that. Those of you guys that have ever had a

501
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:35,670
surprise birthday party that you knew about, don't get loud because that means you knew about it.

502
01:02:36,389 --> 01:02:41,269
You have to go like this. You have to have like a bag in your hand or like a coat in your like under

503
01:02:41,269 --> 01:02:50,920
your arm. You have to go, what the, hey, if you go like, oh, it's like, you know, you played it up.

504
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:56,440
You have to have like a bag in your hand, like a, like a grocery bag or like a briefcase or something.

505
01:02:56,440 --> 01:03:02,940
You have to like be holding it up like this and act kind of surprised. Thanks for the tip. Yeah,

506
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:11,190
of course. Don't you, don't you, didn't you have to dare me when you were in elementary school?

507
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:15,670
You know, dare, dude, assassins really exist. At least I think that's the acronym.

508
01:03:15,670 --> 01:03:20,440
I was absent a lot due to my nut allergy. It was tough times for Pat at

509
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:26,150
Willie's Peanut Butter Factory Elementary School. That's funny. Anyway, did you find out anything

510
01:03:26,150 --> 01:03:31,320
from the family? Well, yeah, I know the sound. They sound nice, but they just might be fluffing

511
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:36,969
you up, you know, buttering your bread roll to throw you off the trail. All right, I've actually

512
01:03:36,969 --> 01:03:41,210
just been sitting here mainlining complimentary bread rolls the whole time you were gone.

513
01:03:46,199 --> 01:03:52,250
I'm a burger boy. We were at, I think we were at, where were we? I think we were at like Outback

514
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:57,829
Steakhouse and we ordered like, there was like three or four of us, we ordered entrees and there

515
01:03:57,829 --> 01:04:04,809
was like this big loaf of bread there, like the, like the free bread. And he didn't like order

516
01:04:04,809 --> 01:04:09,369
anything. He wasn't hungry or like didn't want to like, he didn't have like any cash. And I think

517
01:04:09,369 --> 01:04:13,289
we were probably offered to be like, and he's like, no, no, no, I'm not that hungry. But I don't know

518
01:04:13,289 --> 01:04:18,539
why he like didn't think it was free. I think the waiter came over and he was like, hey, is that free?

519
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:24,090
They're like, yeah. And he just goes, oh, nice. And he picked it up and like started eating it.

520
01:04:25,349 --> 01:04:32,039
It's like what, of course it is. He could have asked us that, right? Hey, hey, so bread, is that

521
01:04:32,039 --> 01:04:41,179
free? Yeah. I think the waiter was like, yeah. I just kept walking. I don't think everybody

522
01:04:41,179 --> 01:04:47,690
at the table was like, what the fuck are you talking about? Oh, so funny. All right. Sorry,

523
01:04:47,690 --> 01:04:52,789
I've actually just been sitting here mainlining complimentary bread rolls. And the bread from

524
01:04:52,789 --> 01:04:58,380
Outback Steakhouse was actually fucking unbelievable. You can say whatever you want about like some of

525
01:04:58,380 --> 01:05:04,309
these chain restaurants. I remember that it was, okay, it was like this little loaf. It was like,

526
01:05:04,309 --> 01:05:12,090
I think it was like pumpernickel, right? What is it? The bread from Outback is like the best thing

527
01:05:12,090 --> 01:05:17,659
in the whole restaurant, like the whole restaurant. They gave you this kind of butter that you really

528
01:05:17,659 --> 01:05:22,409
had to really stick the knife in and really move it around. I mean, literally everything else at

529
01:05:22,409 --> 01:05:26,730
Outback, I don't remember if it was good or not, but that little, it was a tiny little loaf. Oh,

530
01:05:26,730 --> 01:05:34,570
it's awesome. Yeah. The bread is unbelievable. It's really good there. Is it actually, or is he

531
01:05:34,570 --> 01:05:40,679
insane? No, no, I swear. Oh, there's a time limit. All right. And let's loggy with bread. Let's go.

532
01:05:46,099 --> 01:05:51,219
Yeah, there it is. Yep. Yep. Yep. Oh, and the butter too. That butter's perfect. Yep. This is it.

533
01:05:51,219 --> 01:06:03,269
Hold on. That's it. I think that's exactly what it is. This is the bread from Outback. The only

534
01:06:03,269 --> 01:06:21,659
thing I remember. Look at the butter too. Yeah. The butter was so good. Like, is it weird that I

535
01:06:21,659 --> 01:06:27,400
would want to go to Outback and just order like an appetizer and just be like, uh, I would pay for

536
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:32,789
the bread, right? Like if, you know, it's like, oh yeah, do you want like more bread? They'll do

537
01:06:32,789 --> 01:06:36,070
that, right? They'll come back. You want some more bread? But I almost kind of want to be like, hey,

538
01:06:36,070 --> 01:06:40,389
can you just like, can I just like mac and cheese and just, you bring out like five of these,

539
01:06:40,389 --> 01:06:45,219
I'll pay for them. Like I pay for whatever you would think they would cost, whatever they are.

540
01:06:45,219 --> 01:06:56,179
I'll pay for it. Bread tier list. That's how I feel about Olive Garden. Breadsticks from Olive

541
01:06:56,179 --> 01:07:03,960
Garden are actually really good. Steak houses have like really banging bread. Yeah. You can

542
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:17,530
order it to go. Really? Bread makes you fat. So what? All right. My safe place. Find the code to

543
01:07:17,530 --> 01:07:28,519
Pat's abode. Help Pat remember his room code. Thanks for protecting me. It really helps to have

544
01:07:28,519 --> 01:07:33,659
someone walk me to my room. The wallpaper in here is a little intense. That makes me feel like

545
01:07:33,659 --> 01:07:41,559
something is staring at me. What am I going to do? My heart can't take 10 more hours of waiting.

546
01:07:42,199 --> 01:07:54,519
What's the event? What did I squeal the beans on? Cheese and crackers. Am I going to finally

547
01:07:54,519 --> 01:08:06,010
catch this for the first time ever? Come on. Every time I think about it, it just doesn't happen.

548
01:08:06,570 --> 01:08:13,159
I'm ready if it does. Since I was so worried about getting super murdered today, I did the

549
01:08:13,159 --> 01:08:18,760
smart thing and got a special lock for my hotel room door. Just a little something I picked up

550
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:22,840
at the hardware store. I was worried I'd get so nervous that I'd forget the lock's passcode,

551
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:28,760
so I saved it on my website, www.allocator.com. I even made a button you can click for it.

552
01:08:29,319 --> 01:08:32,359
I'm really glad now I took those all these specific button making classes at my local

553
01:08:32,359 --> 01:08:42,819
community center. Okay. It's a virus website. This is Pat's home page generated by Geo Scalies.

554
01:08:46,039 --> 01:08:59,720
Warning. Don't click Pat only. About me. Sorry. Under construction. What is that? This is the code?

555
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:20,300
About me. I'm Pat. Okay. Don't click Pat only. If you're not Pat, you're breaking the law. This has

556
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:37,930
been reported to the computer police. 91619. Okay. I got it. I got it. How do I say I got it?

557
01:09:38,489 --> 01:10:02,380
91619. Let's go. All right. Here we are. Let's freaking go. Let's freaking go! This is for sure

558
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:06,939
my room. You can tell by the unobtrusive lock I installed. Can you go to my website and grab

559
01:10:06,939 --> 01:10:23,529
the code? Okay. Let's go. 9 for the code. How do I enter the code? Oh. You did it. Thank you so much.

560
01:10:24,329 --> 01:10:38,520
Whoa. I can't close it. What's going on? Help. You gotta help me. I don't even like pink. What?

561
01:10:40,819 --> 01:10:47,050
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Back up. I fucked it up. It's getting on my feet. Enter

562
01:10:47,050 --> 01:11:03,460
anything. Oh my gosh. Hello. My word. This is quite the mess. Who are you two and why have you opened

563
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:09,989
my door? Oh my. I'm Pat. This is my hotel room. I installed this lock because my family's trying to

564
01:11:09,989 --> 01:11:15,560
rub me out. This is my door where I've installed the lock because my family's trying to rub me

565
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:26,060
out. But if that's true and my password still worked, is your lock code 91619? Is your lock

566
01:11:26,060 --> 01:11:31,739
code 91619? We have the same code and our families are both trying to kill us.

567
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:44,600
This is very funny. So long stranger. Perhaps in another life we would have been total best friends.

568
01:11:45,159 --> 01:11:50,739
Like ships in the night, Mr. Pat. And if you don't tell anyone what you've seen here or I'll come

569
01:11:50,739 --> 01:12:04,149
for you endlessly. That sure was a string of unlikely coincidences, wasn't it? I hope that

570
01:12:04,149 --> 01:12:10,420
guy's room is OK. That stuff kind of smells like brimstone. Do we actually have the same code?

571
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:25,239
This is awkward. I'm not saying anything. All right. If you have pink stuff in here, it's going

572
01:12:25,239 --> 01:12:37,430
to be wild. All right. Here we go. Thanks. I never would have remembered that on my own. Come on in.

573
01:12:44,260 --> 01:12:47,939
I'm so glad we made it inside. Now I can really try to relax. I'll try to distract you from the

574
01:12:47,939 --> 01:12:52,420
investigation. I'll text you again when it gets closer to 4 p.m. So don't forget to check your

575
01:12:52,420 --> 01:12:57,300
watch. You know, in case you do get distracted doing a collection of menial tasks, formatted

576
01:12:57,300 --> 01:13:11,909
in an enjoyable manner. Something like that. All right. Bye for now. Do I have any minigames? Wait,

577
01:13:11,909 --> 01:13:37,350
who's that? God damn it! It's nice about sitting by yourself in a restaurant with a good book.

578
01:13:37,350 --> 01:13:48,970
My girlfriend's coming to pick me up after work. I'm so nervous. What's in the kitchen?

579
01:13:53,020 --> 01:14:15,130
That was so scary and loud. Oh, puzzle piece. Puzzle piece. Oh, wait. Sound effect number five

580
01:14:15,130 --> 01:14:27,189
in the top five list is coffee pouring into a mug. Yep. Hey, bub, you're just in time for the

581
01:14:27,189 --> 01:14:36,920
trolley got here a minute ago. OK. Why don't you go check out the city? Bring Mickey a hot dog,

582
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:44,229
maybe, or some protective handware. I'm gross. OK. But hold on, there's people here.

583
01:14:44,949 --> 01:14:50,470
Who's this? If we eat a John, Johnny's here, food's all right, but that bottomless chowder

584
01:14:50,470 --> 01:14:54,869
bowl was a disaster. I picked that thing up and bam! Chowdered pants the rest of the day.

585
01:14:55,590 --> 01:15:03,689
Classic work of comedy. Classic comedy. Oh dear, I think I may have left my scrapbooking scissors

586
01:15:03,689 --> 01:15:08,250
at home on accident. Oh, I found my scissors must have been your approach that gave me good luck,

587
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:13,130
stranger. Hee hee. I'm gonna try to go outside, home more, since I had the new baby.

588
01:15:13,930 --> 01:15:16,569
Nana is watching her today, so here I am, out in the world.

589
01:15:18,090 --> 01:15:21,369
A little nerve wracking to be away from the nursery after those months, to be honest.

590
01:15:22,250 --> 01:15:28,250
Oh, I already miss all the new baby smells. Well, not all the smells. We all know more things come

591
01:15:28,250 --> 01:15:32,869
out of babies than just sweet fragrance of their cute little heads. Well, even that stuff is a

592
01:15:32,869 --> 01:15:42,300
little cute. Hee hee. I'm Maria. It's wonderful to meet you. I was heading to the local YACA

593
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:46,460
before I ran into you. I'm taking a class there today on scrapbooking, but I'm a little early.

594
01:15:47,420 --> 01:15:53,340
I meant to wait here in the lovely weather until their class on mom yoga and self-defense ends.

595
01:15:54,220 --> 01:16:05,619
Eat, pray, shove. Hee hee. Do you mean my son Pat? Oh, I'm just so proud of him. It's his birthday

596
01:16:05,619 --> 01:16:13,300
today. Did I fucking talk with you? I told all of you. Why is he not doing voices? This is depressing.

597
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:22,279
What? It's his long game. It's a birthday. It's a birthday. I told you it's a birthday.

598
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:28,550
He's so funny with how he treats himself to a hotel stay every year on the day. He just

599
01:16:28,550 --> 01:16:40,500
loves that continental breakfast. Voices or riot. You're going to make me get up and sing?

600
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:48,140
Oh, yeah. Jeremy has a really good voice. Don't you, Jeremy? Why don't you get up and sing for

601
01:16:48,140 --> 01:17:03,739
us? Twinkle twinkle little star. I don't want to do that. I don't want to do it.

602
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:11,000
I do get concerned he eats too many of those, however. Sud shouldn't be coming out the snoot

603
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:26,409
of a boy that age. What about the event? It's his birthday. The event is why I'm taking this class

604
01:17:26,409 --> 01:17:36,439
today. Okay, so what do you need? Help a mom out. Trying to put together a family tree to bring

605
01:17:36,439 --> 01:17:43,060
tonight. Yeah, I don't have everyone's picture. It's so hard for all of us to get together in one

606
01:17:43,060 --> 01:17:47,699
place these days. I don't think anyone would like me to use their photos from the early 2000s.

607
01:17:47,699 --> 01:17:52,260
We all made some questionable wardrobe decisions back then. Since you're already going around town,

608
01:17:52,260 --> 01:18:05,350
would you mind snapping some pictures of the family? And you get to and you get and bring back

609
01:18:05,350 --> 01:18:08,390
a foot in the family tree. Maybe if you get them all, something good will happen.

610
01:18:09,189 --> 01:18:29,289
Oh, I see you already have one there. Can you put it in? Let's see how much you learned so far.

611
01:18:29,850 --> 01:18:44,140
Okay, what do I know so far? Click and drag the alligator portraits in a position of the family

612
01:18:44,140 --> 01:18:56,619
tree. Come back any time to see your collection. Oh my god, there's so many people. How many people

613
01:18:56,619 --> 01:19:11,720
are in this family? It's like the Elden Ring family tree. Like there's a fucking million people.

614
01:19:12,439 --> 01:19:39,020
I don't know anybody. Can I take your picture? Where's my camera? Ain't nobody can follow these

615
01:19:39,020 --> 01:19:51,210
ferocious fingies. Where's my camera? I want to take a picture of these people. You already got

616
01:19:51,210 --> 01:19:57,989
her picture, but now I take pictures of everybody else. All right, let's go to the fun district.

617
01:19:58,630 --> 01:20:24,659
I'm in the fun district. You got them from the mini game. Oh god, unknown. Again, you're a friendly

618
01:20:24,659 --> 01:20:32,140
city guide here. So I was wondering, have you been finding any puzzle pieces around? I'm going to

619
01:20:32,140 --> 01:20:42,500
write in all capitals, stop, unsubscribe. I thought so. You can find a lot of fun things you might not

620
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:47,380
expect in the city by clicking around. Puzzle pieces, secret baubles to look at, interestingly

621
01:20:47,380 --> 01:20:54,069
shaped sewer rats. It's a real menagerie. Maybe if you find enough pieces, you'll be able to do

622
01:20:54,069 --> 01:20:59,270
something good with them. Like unlock something. Maybe make a small blanket for a family of chilly

623
01:20:59,270 --> 01:21:07,560
squirrels. The world is so bright. Have lots of fun looking around. Oh, there's all kinds of, wait,

624
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:13,899
I sell bugs. Bugs, bugs. All right, I'm going off. You know that there's like an old person

625
01:21:13,899 --> 01:21:20,199
I'm going to do this, right? Bugs, bugs for sale. More than one even, unlike what the sign implies.

626
01:21:22,039 --> 01:21:28,619
Yeah, I sell bugs here. No, not for baiting, for eating. We're alligators and we eat bugs,

627
01:21:28,619 --> 01:21:31,739
which is something you know because you exist here, canonically.

628
01:21:32,779 --> 01:21:40,739
Anyway, get bug buying or goodbye, kiddo. Ain't got all day. But I got to sell bugs to feed my

629
01:21:40,739 --> 01:21:48,550
family with different bugs, which I buy with an alligator currency. What do you know about the

630
01:21:48,550 --> 01:21:57,220
event? The event? I'm not quite sure what you're talking about. I have a selective memory disorder,

631
01:21:57,220 --> 01:22:04,310
you see, and that I forget about things I don't really want to go to. What do you know about Pat?

632
01:22:05,189 --> 01:22:10,390
Oh, did you say Pat? That's my grandson's name, but also the name of the nurse that comes to

633
01:22:10,390 --> 01:22:16,390
massage the kinks out of my tail on Tuesdays. Did you mean Pat or Pat? You'll have to speak

634
01:22:16,390 --> 01:22:20,550
up. I'm hard of hearing due to a condition where I stop listening mid-sentence and think about the

635
01:22:20,550 --> 01:22:30,119
war. Most people call me Capulli, but my real name is Mortimer Giles, Jr., the third and a half,

636
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:35,720
on account of my grandfather being perfectly bisected by a wheat thresher during the Great

637
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:40,600
Depression. Miraculously, he's survived, but his life wasn't without its problems.

638
01:22:41,239 --> 01:22:44,439
That's just how it was hard to see him when he turned directly to one side.

639
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:49,560
Grandpa, where are you, we'd called, but you know Vail, he'd already slipped through a crack

640
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:55,130
in the decorative neolium. It's the last time we ever saw him, and also when those basement

641
01:22:55,130 --> 01:23:00,170
sounds started up. Well, look at me rambling here to a youth about cellar screams and the like.

642
01:23:03,050 --> 01:23:07,930
Perhaps you can jog this old man's memory if you help me out with a favor. You see,

643
01:23:07,930 --> 01:23:13,050
the only photo I have left of my dear late wife, Martha, has also been the victim of a wheat

644
01:23:13,050 --> 01:23:18,810
thresher incident. I can't seem to put it back together again. Oh, how I'd give anything to see

645
01:23:18,810 --> 01:23:25,529
Martha's sweet smile again. Can I help this old softy gaze upon his love, lost love once more?

646
01:23:27,930 --> 01:23:34,569
Sure, Grandpa, I'll help you. Get the pieces glued for this old dude. Make my wife please.

647
01:23:36,699 --> 01:23:42,390
Like a block to slide it into the empty space would be a very simple picture to gaze upon

648
01:23:42,390 --> 01:23:59,220
the alligator's beautiful wife. Am I actually on a timer for this? All right,

649
01:23:59,220 --> 01:24:28,140
this is gonna go off. Fuck, I'm so bad at these. You have no idea. Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait.

650
01:24:32,939 --> 01:24:44,359
Oh, it's close. It's close. It's close. I got it. I got it. Almost. I got it. I got it. I just did

651
01:24:44,359 --> 01:24:49,449
it. I got it. I just did it. I literally just did it. That was in record time. That's it. I just did

652
01:24:49,449 --> 01:25:08,420
it. Oh dear, it seems you've seen the other side now with my secret wife. Could you put this one

653
01:25:08,420 --> 01:25:23,050
back together too? If not for me then for creepy old coot grandpas everywhere? What? Oh no. What

654
01:25:23,050 --> 01:25:26,409
the hell? I don't know. This is gonna take so long. I'm not gonna be able to do this one.

655
01:25:27,050 --> 01:25:56,970
This has got to go top left. Just get this where it needs to be. Is that the right way? I think

656
01:25:56,970 --> 01:26:08,100
this is probably like that, right? This? I don't know. What? It looks like you're not very good

657
01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:20,100
at this. No, not taking this. Okay, that's correct but I gotta get it over there.

658
01:26:27,270 --> 01:26:46,550
All right. Why are there two? Why are there like three people in this picture? Who is this?

659
01:26:53,300 --> 01:27:07,300
Where does this go? Somebody in the front? Whose head belongs on here? I don't get it.

660
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:37,539
Whose fucking head goes on here? All right, it's that one and then there's three people in this

661
01:27:37,539 --> 01:28:09,539
picture. Oh, leave me alone. This is here. All right, wait, wait, wait. Okay, so he's all the way

662
01:28:09,539 --> 01:29:13,210
to the left, right? She's in the middle, right? Right? Fuck. This is hard. That's not right.

663
01:29:16,020 --> 01:29:22,779
I'm so confused. Is it? Wait, wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Bring everything down. Bring everything down.

664
01:29:22,779 --> 01:29:44,739
Bring everything down. Shit. I can't do these. This is too much. This is, this is correct but

665
01:29:44,739 --> 01:31:24,039
I don't want to touch this. Damn it. This is down here. Fuck. Chat, please be supportive. Dude,

666
01:31:24,039 --> 01:31:34,310
it's hard. You're nearly there. I know. I'm almost there. I just gotta get it correct. All right,

667
01:31:34,310 --> 01:31:52,340
this has got to go up there. Let me just get it over there. Okay, that's done. This whole side is

668
01:31:52,340 --> 01:32:39,510
done. Don't touch it. Fuck. It's close. So close. Come on. All right, don't touch this one. Can I

669
01:32:39,510 --> 01:33:08,840
do it without touching that? I'm melting. I'm doing it. It's so close. I'm almost there.

670
01:33:09,399 --> 01:33:15,609
This has got to come over here. All right, I just got to do this.

671
01:33:54,489 --> 01:34:15,880
Stop making fun of me. What's it doing? Get out of here. I can't do it. I can't do it. I can't do

672
01:34:15,880 --> 01:34:24,180
it. I can't do it. It's like, it's too, it's like my brain cannot do it. My brain can't do it. Even

673
01:34:24,180 --> 01:34:29,699
if I sit there and think for a second, it's just like, like that's all I hear. All I hear in my

674
01:34:29,699 --> 01:35:37,750
head is the net. There's nothing with that sound. Ah, I can't. It's so easy. This is harder than

675
01:35:37,750 --> 01:35:45,399
millennia. I beat millennia. Look, everybody has a left left brain and a right brain. Okay.

676
01:35:46,359 --> 01:35:54,680
My left brain is this big. It's this big. It's like you'd have to go under a microscope to look

677
01:35:54,680 --> 01:36:03,239
at it. My right brain is so large, it's swelling up my skull. You get it? It's like, oh my goodness,

678
01:36:03,239 --> 01:36:08,229
it's swelling up so much. I can't, it's so much. You have to go to a microscope to find the other

679
01:36:08,229 --> 01:36:17,180
side. A microscope. Left brain, right brain is a myth. Yeah, but whatever. You could like,

680
01:36:17,180 --> 01:36:20,539
whatever. We can speculate. We don't even know. Okay. We don't know how the dinosaurs died. We're

681
01:36:20,539 --> 01:36:29,079
speculating. It was a meteor. Yeah, we don't know that. We don't know how they died. They could have

682
01:36:29,079 --> 01:36:31,880
something else going to happen. They could have like eaten each other. There could have been like

683
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:38,920
an explosion from a volcano. Not a meteor. Who knows? We don't know. A big rock, you don't know.

684
01:36:38,920 --> 01:36:43,159
A big rock could have hit it. Yeah. But also, there could have been like a volcano that erupted

685
01:36:43,159 --> 01:36:51,430
a huge one. A super mega volcano. Right? Nobody knows. All we can do is we can look at fossils

686
01:36:51,430 --> 01:36:56,550
on the ground and go, that was a meteor. I think. Yep. We don't know. Nobody knows. We don't know.

687
01:36:56,550 --> 01:36:59,510
You don't know. You don't know anything. You don't know anything. This puzzle is hard. You couldn't

688
01:36:59,510 --> 01:37:34,439
do it. All right. All right. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. Bro, there's like one thing I

689
01:37:34,439 --> 01:37:44,649
can't do and it's these fucking sliding puzzles. Break up the right column. I, who cares? What is

690
01:37:44,649 --> 01:37:49,210
the, who cares if you can't do a sliding puzzle? Does it really matter? Does that really matter

691
01:37:49,210 --> 01:37:55,449
that much? That doesn't matter. Oh, you can't do one of those. Oh, does it matter? Oh, I can't do

692
01:37:55,449 --> 01:38:31,340
it. Oh no, I can't do the sliding puzzles. I can't, who cares? Oh, I got it. What if there was a

693
01:38:31,340 --> 01:38:35,979
life-threatening situation where there was an escape room and you had to get out within 10 minutes

694
01:38:35,979 --> 01:38:44,069
for that? Or like, no, I'm dead. I'm just dead. I'm going to die. I literally die. I literally die.

695
01:38:46,119 --> 01:38:52,600
One of you could have said in the chat, hey dude, I'm going to give, um, 50 million dollars in bits

696
01:38:52,600 --> 01:38:58,039
if you do this in 10 minutes. I wouldn't do it. I actually wouldn't have been able to do it. I

697
01:38:58,039 --> 01:39:04,890
would have been like, oh my god, I wouldn't have done it. I just wouldn't have done it. I got it

698
01:39:04,890 --> 01:39:18,939
though. That was fun. Oh, Gertie, good old Gertie. It's been years since I've looked upon your sweet,

699
01:39:18,939 --> 01:39:24,060
curly hair and your man-breaking arms. Thank you so much for your help, stranger. Thanks to you,

700
01:39:24,060 --> 01:39:29,560
I'm reunited with both my lost loves. I just have like this red image sitting here.

701
01:39:30,520 --> 01:39:40,170
Far the past years ago, but Gertie is just in witness protection, you know, from all the

702
01:39:40,170 --> 01:39:46,710
man-breaking. What a firecracker, that gal. On full days, I could still feel the phantom

703
01:39:46,710 --> 01:39:55,289
broken body pains she left me. Hey, a vent? Oh, you mean tonight's a vent? You young folk love

704
01:39:55,289 --> 01:40:01,850
staying up late. Me, I've been bed by six nightly after a modest dinner of soft bug puddings and

705
01:40:01,850 --> 01:40:08,010
four to seven episodes of soft flutes on public broadcast. Anyway, kiddo, thanks again for helping

706
01:40:08,010 --> 01:40:14,869
me out, or should I say helping three out. Yeah, don't tell my grandkids. And look, here's a little

707
01:40:14,869 --> 01:40:29,720
something for your trouble. All right, no more slide puzzles and we'll be fine. The breeze,

708
01:40:29,720 --> 01:40:44,630
the practicing quartet, what a perfect day to be a live alligator. Sleepy pants. Oh no, the snipper.

709
01:40:45,590 --> 01:40:51,060
Are you here about joining the resistance? Come to the front door, but don't let the feds tail you.

710
01:40:51,699 --> 01:40:57,060
Password is the only thing worth fighting for. Justice Absolute, which is also the name of my

711
01:40:57,060 --> 01:41:04,409
favorite Mark's Leaning Ska Band. Yes, I said favorite. There are more than one. There are two,

712
01:41:04,409 --> 01:41:09,050
as a matter of fact. Their first single was about putting a potato in the tailpipe of a

713
01:41:09,050 --> 01:41:14,810
crooked alligator governor when he tried to join their mailing list. No GMOs. That's no

714
01:41:14,810 --> 01:41:25,020
governors may opt in. Which event? I have four events to go to this week alone. Like tomorrow,

715
01:41:25,020 --> 01:41:30,779
it's Minestrone Monday at the soup kitchen. Then it's onto Taco Tuesday at the women's shelter.

716
01:41:31,420 --> 01:41:36,220
Wednesday doesn't have a funny name, but everyone does get those cupcakes with the white squiggly

717
01:41:36,220 --> 01:41:40,220
as an extra at the alligator food bank. If you're talking about tonight though,

718
01:41:40,220 --> 01:41:45,340
you might as well go act like a cop somewhere else, officer pinstripes. I don't rat out my

719
01:41:45,340 --> 01:41:52,220
comrades. My name is bolted up so tight the count of Monte Cristo has spent years trying to escape

720
01:41:52,220 --> 01:41:57,659
from me while plotting his vengeance against those who wronged him. We just finished reading

721
01:41:57,659 --> 01:42:02,779
that book in my Tuesday Lit class. Pretty baller to be honest. I love revenge and breakfast.

722
01:42:03,659 --> 01:42:11,060
What do you know about Pat? Do you mean Hat Pat or do you mean Bat Pat? No, no, you probably

723
01:42:11,060 --> 01:42:18,180
mean Hat Pat. Bat Pat is my high school neighbor that used to pick me up for DSA meetings on Friday

724
01:42:18,180 --> 01:42:25,939
until he got grounded. He'd apparently broken his nice favorite set of extremely fragile and large

725
01:42:25,939 --> 01:42:32,100
eyed porcelain deer with something. A club? Well it's not important. We'll spring him eventually.

726
01:42:32,100 --> 01:42:37,859
Yes dad, I mean legally. Anyway, Hat Pat is an okay dude. I barely know the guy but he still made

727
01:42:37,859 --> 01:42:46,899
me punch proof vest to wear to protest out of Dr. Soda bottle caps. He's a stand up alligator.

728
01:42:47,779 --> 01:42:51,460
Maybe he drinks too much soda though. Doesn't he know what the government puts in that stuff?

729
01:42:52,579 --> 01:42:56,020
I tell you but the CIA agent that watches my cell phone would probably delete my

730
01:42:56,020 --> 01:43:05,109
chumbler in vengeance. That's where I keep all my pictures of day one. Okay. I'm Mona but you can

731
01:43:05,109 --> 01:43:11,829
call me by my online handle for safety which is kpopangel85 but I can have other interests

732
01:43:11,829 --> 01:43:18,039
besides the cause. All right what do you what do you what do you want me to do? Listen I'm not

733
01:43:18,039 --> 01:43:22,359
trying to give you crud about Pat or something. I'm just a little stressed out. I don't have to go

734
01:43:22,359 --> 01:43:29,399
all first world probes on you bobs but I have a design due to be scanned tomorrow afternoon.

735
01:43:30,119 --> 01:43:34,119
If I miss this deadline it won't get printed in time for the indie comics annual people with

736
01:43:34,119 --> 01:43:41,289
bangs convention this weekend. You know how long it takes to staple a stack of these zines? At

737
01:43:41,289 --> 01:43:46,409
least two full episodes listening to gator crater a true crime podcast about the world's most blown

738
01:43:46,409 --> 01:43:53,659
up alligators. Yes dad I also have Algebra 2 homework. If you know we put some of these pictures

739
01:43:53,659 --> 01:43:58,539
together maybe I could give you the straight dope about the dope. Get ready to join the resistance.

740
01:43:59,500 --> 01:44:04,680
Okay make paper words salad because your voice is valid smells like

741
01:44:04,680 --> 01:44:12,439
zine spirit. Mona's zine needs to cover three topics evenly choose a clip to add to the zine

742
01:44:12,439 --> 01:44:15,640
and click the page to glue it in place because some clips cover two topics at once.

743
01:44:17,880 --> 01:44:22,659
So check it pinstripes I've already done all the hard zine stuff like picking the clips and

744
01:44:22,659 --> 01:44:27,430
cutting everything with semi-straight lines. I need you to pick a good selection then glue them

745
01:44:27,430 --> 01:44:34,390
into place. Sadly ever since the stickening of 2017 I'm not allowed to use glue myself

746
01:44:35,029 --> 01:44:39,750
or glue sticks or rubber cement or large stickers or small stickers so you're gonna have to be the

747
01:44:39,750 --> 01:44:46,470
hero that sticks the pics. This sign encompasses of course the most the three most important most

748
01:44:46,470 --> 01:44:52,550
ziny things possible. I'm talking about social issues indie comics and k-pop obviously. These

749
01:44:52,550 --> 01:44:56,310
three topics go together like peanut butter jelly and a third comparable thing that escapes me at

750
01:44:56,310 --> 01:45:02,630
this moment. That doesn't mean we can lean into any one more than the other. My zine has to be

751
01:45:02,630 --> 01:45:07,750
balanced or people will think I'm biased. That means no page space for anything more than the other.

752
01:45:08,550 --> 01:45:12,869
So pick up a pic and get ready to stick careful though I have a limited selection of content

753
01:45:12,869 --> 01:45:20,140
and my glue is forever just ask my hamster. Grip in Valhalla goopy the third 2015 to 2017.

754
01:45:21,460 --> 01:45:31,300
zine for god's sake zine what magazine oh a magazine when you're done we'll ask the

755
01:45:31,300 --> 01:45:38,090
editor if it's ready to scan so get pasting okay so what was it cover is really important

756
01:45:38,090 --> 01:45:43,770
as to portray the essence of what's on the inside really choosing what ironically humorous t-shirt

757
01:45:43,770 --> 01:45:51,640
to sport at Rosh Hashana that'll really unsettle your extended family wait what no I didn't want

758
01:45:51,640 --> 01:45:59,640
to choose that heat it wibbly fin this will get him cancelled for sure I don't know I just

759
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:06,569
clicked on the first one don't forget to balance the topics okay I wouldn't want anyone to accuse

760
01:46:06,569 --> 01:46:18,390
me of political bias or standing bias okay so we already did wibbly fin right this one guys together

761
01:46:18,390 --> 01:46:32,920
forever together forever okay what's this one is it a meme all right oh well I'm going to send this

762
01:46:32,920 --> 01:46:37,079
to everyone I know and some people like don't if you type random numbers into your phone they

763
01:46:37,079 --> 01:46:43,659
have to go somewhere right Jesus do we really want someone who eat do we really want someone

764
01:46:43,659 --> 01:46:56,500
who eat a sad lunch for another term in office oh my god I mean that's fucking crazy that's so

765
01:46:56,500 --> 01:47:05,260
like sad to be honest this one kind of mondo bums me out I didn't win the zine award last year

766
01:47:05,500 --> 01:47:15,989
last year's calm but I did place third in cool bangs Joshua Ransom oh okay wait this is a

767
01:47:15,989 --> 01:47:20,470
like celebrity or something I didn't really get an interview this is just what I hope he'd say to me

768
01:47:20,470 --> 01:47:31,989
ah I love you JR hope you read this this is balancing it out right question oh okay that's

769
01:47:31,989 --> 01:47:36,390
okay I love you what type of girls do you like oh any kind but most of the kind that are like you

770
01:47:36,390 --> 01:47:43,340
on the inside this one's a real exclusive I can't believe we got it last inside page is a hard

771
01:47:43,340 --> 01:47:48,460
hitter you have to really leave them wanting more like really actually more like maybe they'll give

772
01:47:48,460 --> 01:47:59,750
you a couple more bucks to pick up a few more for their comrades this is lois she feels wibbly fin

773
01:47:59,750 --> 01:48:06,420
is an inadequate mayor balance the budget he can't even balance on this log in his own yard

774
01:48:06,420 --> 01:48:11,140
nonetheless all right yeah this is particularly damning but I pride my zines on delivering

775
01:48:14,149 --> 01:48:20,550
health care or public restroom chocolate fountain wibbly fin would rather save the scales

776
01:48:20,550 --> 01:48:29,109
on his back than weigh in on what matters we are but no it can't be too we can't be too political

777
01:48:30,649 --> 01:48:37,539
we can't be too this is we've already got political well I will always be so alone I

778
01:48:37,539 --> 01:48:43,779
just need to be on my own at least this guy misunderstands is still streaming final season

779
01:48:43,779 --> 01:48:54,630
this one really taps into the deep well of the soul we're almost there just paste on the back

780
01:48:54,630 --> 01:49:06,090
cover and we'll be done mayor wibble fin uncompromising hair partisan teeth he's got an

781
01:49:06,090 --> 01:49:14,340
okay hand cherry mandarin fingers embezzling tail mayor wibbly fin would make a terrible

782
01:49:14,340 --> 01:49:18,579
addition to the k-pop group eight guys and therefore we should examine what type of

783
01:49:18,579 --> 01:49:23,699
politicians we really want to hold office in our beloved city as you can see from this photo

784
01:49:23,699 --> 01:49:28,420
he just doesn't fit and therefore the case is made that he's out of touch despite his effort

785
01:49:28,420 --> 01:49:39,819
to not look out of touch and looks gross here in this photo okay I don't like it so it makes

786
01:49:39,819 --> 01:49:48,100
me feel there's a really solid case you're all done hand it over I said fair and balanced but

787
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:52,340
you're clearly favoring one topic over the others I should have known better than to ask an outsider

788
01:49:52,340 --> 01:49:59,739
what I got it wrong what oh my god all right it's this three topics let me just get it right

789
01:50:02,170 --> 01:50:12,500
shit all right not more than one or the other okay okay okay okay okay I the the mayor ones

790
01:50:12,500 --> 01:50:19,989
which is kind of funny all right we're gonna start with the mayor exposing the mayor okay

791
01:50:20,789 --> 01:50:33,880
expose start with a mayor then not too much mayor so we're gonna go with this is the band

792
01:50:33,880 --> 01:50:43,050
eight guys so we have one for the mayor one for eight guys now I need okay this is like a

793
01:50:43,609 --> 01:50:55,000
little comic book or something meme okay so I've got one of each sad meal we have two mayors and

794
01:50:55,000 --> 01:51:10,100
one of the others two mayors this is also because we have two eight guys and two mayors okay now we

795
01:51:10,100 --> 01:51:22,310
need something that's not the mayor or eight guys is this one no no shit this is three eight guys

796
01:51:22,310 --> 01:51:35,770
two mayor one of something else this is three mayor nope wait hold on oh here we go yep all

797
01:51:35,770 --> 01:51:46,340
right this is like a comic book we have three eight guys two mayor two right right it's a comic

798
01:51:46,340 --> 01:51:52,060
book all right so we're almost there just paste on the back cover so now we need another uh comic

799
01:51:52,060 --> 01:52:02,729
book right is that gonna be all right this one right that'd be three two three is that two three

800
01:52:02,729 --> 01:52:12,760
two will that be enough is this eight guys oh that's eight guys no I didn't want to click I

801
01:52:12,760 --> 01:52:17,260
wanted to put it over it okay whatever we do again we're gonna do it again we're gonna do it

802
01:52:17,260 --> 01:52:23,939
whatever whatever whatever I wanted to switch it I just click paste we're gonna another hour is

803
01:52:23,939 --> 01:52:33,289
gonna go by all right fuck okay help me retract shit I wanted to move it okay okay okay okay what

804
01:52:33,289 --> 01:52:43,579
do I start with I'm not gonna start with the mayor there's too many mayors don't open with the mayor

805
01:52:44,380 --> 01:52:54,229
open with um this one I'm gonna open with the comic book one right that makes sense

806
01:52:55,850 --> 01:53:10,630
indie comic one now I can do I can do eight guys and the mayor okay so we need to do meme

807
01:53:11,430 --> 01:53:21,979
and now we need a mayor there we go we're pretty balanced now right so that's two comic one of the

808
01:53:21,979 --> 01:53:34,760
other ones okay here we go this is two comic two um eight guys right oh wait no no no wait

809
01:53:34,760 --> 01:53:44,380
this is eight guys person this is both eight guys is this a comic okay wait so this is eight guys

810
01:53:44,380 --> 01:53:55,350
yep okay so we have two eight guys two comic one mayor we need another mayor okay we gotta balance

811
01:53:55,350 --> 01:54:03,210
this up what's this one we need a mayor eight guys the last one needs to be a comic and that's it

812
01:54:04,760 --> 01:54:17,529
right mayor and comic I don't have mayor in comic do I don't I my only options are our mayor right

813
01:54:18,250 --> 01:54:29,260
so eight guys comic no comic for the back cover you will have to have a comic term of two people

814
01:54:29,979 --> 01:54:40,710
the last one can be mayor eight guys burgers and fries by the way keep comic mayor which I do

815
01:54:41,350 --> 01:54:49,579
right now it's one politics two k-pop two indie comic so this would be two two two but fuck help

816
01:54:49,579 --> 01:55:00,520
me mayor then comic book this is mayor now we get comic book and then the back cover is eight guys

817
01:55:00,520 --> 01:55:17,880
and that's it that's it right I think back cover is comic book I think that's correct then we end

818
01:55:17,880 --> 01:55:29,289
up with the comic and that's it we got it got it that's it no that's eight guys fuck did I get it

819
01:55:29,930 --> 01:55:42,329
that's two three does this count as both back cover is mayor and this is comic though technically

820
01:55:42,329 --> 01:56:02,140
right you the mayor one this counts as mayor and comic this one is mayor and comic right you

821
01:56:02,140 --> 01:56:10,550
cringe I think that's good that should be it right this is mayor and k-pop mayor I need mayor and

822
01:56:10,550 --> 01:56:30,359
comic all right this is gonna be the one what do I need comic was the cover this is this is it all

823
01:56:30,359 --> 01:56:40,229
right that's it that would be three three three I'm just gonna write fucking down I'm gonna write

824
01:56:40,229 --> 01:56:46,060
this shit down I'm I can't I've ran out of time I've run out of time I didn't I didn't know that

825
01:56:46,060 --> 01:56:57,750
too they could be two different things fuck god damn it all right I get it I'm gonna write it down

826
01:56:57,750 --> 01:57:25,829
I'm literally gonna write it down all right what are we doing okay cover needs to be comic we got

827
01:57:25,829 --> 01:57:34,619
one comic some covers are two topics all right so we need the cover we need the comic cover

828
01:57:35,989 --> 01:57:56,229
all right then we want may no eight guys be one eight guys I don't know which one covers all three

829
01:57:56,869 --> 01:58:15,930
this one does because this would be one eight guys and then this is that's good now we need a

830
01:58:15,930 --> 01:58:30,310
mayor one mayor which is right here fuck um comic this is too comic or should I do two eight guys

831
01:58:30,869 --> 01:58:48,739
this would be too comic cover is all three one no this is too comic too comic well we have two

832
01:58:48,739 --> 01:58:57,640
comic one eight guys now this is mayor that would be two comic one eight guys one mayor

833
01:59:01,239 --> 01:59:16,699
okay and this is eight guys this is this is this is eight guys there'll be two eight guys

834
01:59:17,420 --> 01:59:31,659
is that we two comic two eight guys one mayor am I doing the same thing okay that's

835
01:59:31,659 --> 01:59:45,430
two comic two eight guys one mayor now I need um I need mayor that'd be two two that'd be two two two

836
01:59:48,539 --> 01:59:58,090
this would be two two two this would be three guys three this is what is this two mayor now

837
02:00:00,250 --> 02:00:13,560
and then putting this would be three guys two mayor um eight not three what this is one comic

838
02:00:13,560 --> 02:00:19,050
one this is I wrote I wrote I fucking wrote something down I fucked it up right now I'm at

839
02:00:19,050 --> 02:00:31,539
two two one so this would be I'm so confused because this accounts as two left brain logic

840
02:00:31,539 --> 02:00:43,210
I'll dodge an axe if you swing it at me I I've lost I'm you know I gotta turn the music off it's

841
02:00:43,210 --> 02:00:48,329
like literally fucking with my brain all right music off we got two two one right now this would

842
02:00:48,329 --> 02:01:01,050
be three two two right three two two three two two if I put this here I'm just fucking doing it

843
02:01:01,050 --> 02:01:09,210
I don't care I'll leave I'm leaving if I don't get it right three two two that's three comic two

844
02:01:09,210 --> 02:01:19,479
eight guys two mayor now I need this would be three mayor I just need one eight guys on the back

845
02:01:20,119 --> 02:01:24,760
and I'm done because that would be three comic two eight guys three mayor that's it I just need

846
02:01:24,760 --> 02:01:34,819
comic on the back and that's it right I just need just comic on the back is it is it not possible

847
02:01:35,539 --> 02:01:50,489
I need comic on back no comic is on the back of the eight guys what there are no comic on the back

848
02:01:50,489 --> 02:01:58,020
there is none so if I do this this would be free I stop I have to stop writing shit down before

849
02:01:58,020 --> 02:02:07,270
it happens so this is comic I'm just gonna look up the solution all the backs are two topics

850
02:02:07,989 --> 02:02:16,069
there are no comics for the back so this this would get us to three comic right

851
02:02:20,100 --> 02:02:29,579
both mayor no don't do both mayor what do I do comic now and then mayor it's a comic and also

852
02:02:29,579 --> 02:02:35,699
eight guys is it this is eight guys no it's not it's a streaming thing I'm just doing it I don't

853
02:02:35,699 --> 02:02:42,229
care and I'm literally now I'm literally not coming back okay two now I just need mayor

854
02:02:43,189 --> 02:02:53,609
and that should be it right right or do I need eight guys this is is this eight guys in the back

855
02:02:53,609 --> 02:03:08,869
this is it I did it right yo let's show it to the editor for approval

856
02:03:12,810 --> 02:03:23,350
yeah sure we're good what's going on mayor comic comic eight guys all right what I was

857
02:03:23,350 --> 02:03:29,930
gonna say is five guys went up to S tier for me looks like we're all set to scan and send to the

858
02:03:29,930 --> 02:03:41,479
printers uh I've recently had five guys and it was it was way better than Shake Shack I don't know

859
02:03:41,479 --> 02:03:47,289
what happened to Shake Shack but holy shit it fell off hard so hard you want to know something

860
02:03:47,289 --> 02:03:54,180
fucked up you know I I was a Shake Shack fan I was an absolute Shake Shack maniac um I've had it a

861
02:03:54,180 --> 02:04:03,050
few times and holy shit it fell the fuck off so bad the last time I've ordered Shake Shack the

862
02:04:03,050 --> 02:04:09,720
burger's been like not good it's like the texture length has been weird and if you get lettuce on a

863
02:04:09,720 --> 02:04:14,119
Shake Shack burger this is just my this is what's happened to me the last few times this might not

864
02:04:14,119 --> 02:04:21,020
be your experience but holy shit it's been mine dude the lettuce is like one tiny little joke

865
02:04:21,020 --> 02:04:28,539
piece of wilted like wet gross lettuce like this it was dog shit dog shit I'm not even knocking it

866
02:04:28,539 --> 02:04:35,350
was dog shit if you open the bun of like a recent Shake Shack burger it fucking looks like this

867
02:04:36,149 --> 02:04:44,170
and it's like just it's one tiny little pathetic piece yeah I had a five guys burger the lettuce

868
02:04:44,170 --> 02:04:49,689
was fucking big and crispy it was a tomato it was a big thick delicious tomato burger was cooked

869
02:04:49,689 --> 02:04:56,170
perfectly I have to amend the fast food tier list Shake Shack literally went down to like a B

870
02:04:56,729 --> 02:05:04,859
maybe even lower it sucks literally was my favorite place I'm sorry like you you know I'm not a

871
02:05:04,859 --> 02:05:10,859
bullshitter I it was up an S tier but but why was there tomato on it I just felt like it one day

872
02:05:10,859 --> 02:05:15,500
I know tomatoes I don't tomatoes gross I just felt like it it was good I felt like it I felt

873
02:05:15,500 --> 02:05:20,970
like it you fell off shut up I felt like it today I didn't eat it today you know what I mean I felt

874
02:05:20,970 --> 02:05:28,310
like it like recently I felt like eating tomato on my burger I felt like it I had to test to see

875
02:05:28,310 --> 02:05:35,510
how juicy and firm and crispy it was you know I mean I had to test it because if your lettuce

876
02:05:35,510 --> 02:05:39,510
if your vegetables I get to check and see that because that's important I don't like lettuce

877
02:05:39,510 --> 02:05:44,420
tomato on a hamburger but I had to try to see how well it was it's crispy it was juicy and

878
02:05:44,420 --> 02:05:59,510
watery and delicious calm the fuck down dude you know oh that's pretty rad tagline if I had public

879
02:05:59,510 --> 02:06:03,829
access channel talk show which is 100% of the cards by the way if I keep a B plus his second

880
02:06:03,829 --> 02:06:09,270
term that would definitely be my sassy catchphrase anyways the event is a gross allocation of funds

881
02:06:09,270 --> 02:06:15,930
if you want my opinion I'm fine what have you calmed down what are you talking about you know

882
02:06:15,930 --> 02:06:22,460
that helium is a finite resource seriously I'll google it every balloon it's a party every balloon

886
02:06:45,460 --> 02:06:54,500
over I feel like I was kind of unfair to five guys because when you order a five guys burger

887
02:06:54,500 --> 02:07:00,500
and you get fries they just dump they just dump fries in the bag it's just it's like a joke they

888
02:07:00,500 --> 02:07:05,859
just put like five servings worth in the bag and they're kind of like messy and shit and they look

889
02:07:06,180 --> 02:07:13,720
they're a little greasy for me but the burgers it went up to esther I have to be honest I'm sorry

02:14:18,810 --> 02:14:24,569
for thinking so but with a drab wardrobe and pathetic sunken eyes everything here is the

930
02:14:24,569 --> 02:14:33,050
clear stink of death upon it oh except for me of course i'm merely a poor poor woman in deep mourning

931
02:14:34,060 --> 02:14:37,819
not at all one involved in mysterious circumstances the police cannot explain

932
02:14:38,619 --> 02:14:46,579
oh i can't even imagine attending the event unchaperoned only my poor dear husband had been

933
02:14:46,579 --> 02:14:52,630
less poisoned i wouldn't have to suffer such horrific indignities will no one think of me

934
02:14:52,630 --> 02:15:00,869
and my feelings i'm merely a lonely widow left behind for the great beyond by my beloved late

935
02:15:00,869 --> 02:15:09,079
husband horace oh horace such a always such a wonderful wisp of a man even at his most poisoned

937
02:15:14,489 --> 02:15:23,189
to take comfort in the metaphysical arts if only i could hear his sweet strained voice once more

938
02:15:23,270 --> 02:15:30,199

02:15:36,199 --> 02:15:42,789
children once removed at the very least that's a little comfort to me especially when i see

1140
02:47:05,559 --> 02:47:11,719
your gene pool the amount of dna shared between us is blessedly on the shallow side much like your

1141
02:47:11,719 --> 02:47:20,459
personality sister oh prince you're such a cut up much like how i cut up your invitation to the

1142

yeah brother this nobody doesn't seem to be aware of who we are bless you indeed sister

1145
02:47:38,969 --> 02:47:43,049
perhaps with that pinstripe style they've spent the last 30 or so years locked in a storage closet

1146
02:47:43,049 --> 02:47:52,950
with their fingers in their ears and their other fingers in their eyes and fingers yet still in

1147

they couldn't test for that gene and you know it prince you see our beloved daddy passed away

1151
02:48:20,969 --> 02:48:27,059
just recently from poison related complications you know the natural way we're splitting up our

1152
02:48:27,059 --> 02:48:31,700
shared inheritance but we could really use a mediator and someone to protect my beautiful

1153
02:48:31,700 --> 02:48:39,579
face from dear sister's punches it's true i punch super duper hard if only we had some help dividing

1224
03:06:52,500 --> 03:06:58,659
visit online plus i own a somewhat unsettling amount of powerful crystals their potent energies

1225
03:06:58,659 --> 03:07:04,299
course through me in my inner core which is great since i spent the last of my dosh on some

1226
03:07:04,299 --> 03:07:11,940
suspiciously expensive crystals my inner core is super starving man all right what do i have to do

for you i could actually like probably tell you a few things if you do me a solid first you see

1228
03:07:16,739 --> 03:07:22,260
those suspiciously expensive crystals i mentioned earlier well those little mamas were also

1229
03:07:22,260 --> 03:07:27,700
suspiciously powerful from just three nights of holding them even when i had to get up to pee i

1230
03:07:27,700 --> 03:07:33,459
feel mystically charged enough to access my innermost self but in my tireless questing through

1231
03:07:33,459 --> 03:07:40,229
the crystal concentration arts i just don't have the time to shower or dust my pewter miniatures

1232
03:07:40,229 --> 03:07:47,209
besides bathing is a way for the man to keep us down you should be sliding across the floor on an

1233
03:07:47,209 --> 03:07:54,139
oil slick of your own creation like nature intended oh my aromatic scent keeps away a lot

1234
03:07:54,139 --> 03:08:02,549
of unwanted company like solicitors and my father but did invite others talking about flies these

1235
03:08:02,549 --> 03:08:09,989
little buzzing buzz kills keep harshing my mellow they're making it impossible for me to concentrate

1236
03:08:10,709 --> 03:08:18,500
on my inner light to do it inner right if you know what i mean if you could just swat them away from

1246
03:10:26,739 --> 03:10:40,260
reach my most powerful form i'm still the aiden you've known and adored for so so long but a new

1247
03:10:40,260 --> 03:10:48,549
more powerful aiden as it were like how i haven't been paid in weeks i'm so hungry

1251
03:11:08,069 --> 03:11:13,430
a being of pure energy and knowledge given form but also a being that's like extremely good at

1252
03:11:13,430 --> 03:11:18,739
keeping secrets man what little i can tell you is it concerns pat for a certain reason

1253
03:11:19,459 --> 03:11:23,059

1254
03:11:23,620 --> 03:11:29,129

in my broken phone how did anyone even get by before modern cell phone technology how did they

1264
03:12:38,469 --> 03:12:42,149
send each other messages or watch videos about people drinking a gallon of milk and throwing up

1265
03:12:42,870 --> 03:12:51,020

1322
03:24:15,299 --> 03:24:34,090
forever there's a crazy part right but like if you if you open the door and whoever's in there

1323
03:24:34,090 --> 03:24:40,409
can't fucking hear you but it's time for dinner like how are you going to get their attention

1324
03:24:41,209 --> 03:24:48,040
you like calling them maybe like a discord message right you're gonna like you're gonna

1325
03:24:48,040 --> 03:24:56,659
have to go through discord and like hopefully they go who's up you have to go shake them

1326
03:24:57,219 --> 03:25:02,170
i don't even think that would work flip the lights on up i don't think that would even work

1327
03:25:03,450 --> 03:25:09,690
like you're moving so much that like you like shaking them is like they're not gonna even know

1328
03:25:11,590 --> 03:25:25,450
you throw something at them like frisbee something into the room and it's like

1329
03:25:26,170 --> 03:25:38,579
like frisbees in and like stop stalling we're not stalling stalling stalling all these stalling

1330
03:25:38,579 --> 03:25:55,049
andies no no you know what that is that's just all the hardest difficulty on dance dance revolution

1331
03:25:57,270 --> 03:26:00,469
that's the one where you see the people that are standing with their arms holding the

1332
03:26:01,030 --> 03:26:03,989
they're holding the bar like this behind them and they're just like

1333
03:26:07,590 --> 03:26:15,639
like just a feet of fucking going crazy and you walk by and you're just like shit wow how are they

1334
03:26:15,639 --> 03:26:22,139
even doing that it's impossible that's what reminds me of you know i my brain is just too small to

rope around our legs pat flipped out and thought he was being kidnapped and running like a maniac

1554
04:02:20,950 --> 04:02:26,069
down the football field with my gym pants still attached to it it's how i got my other nickname

birthmark but since then we've been good pals despite it love that weird little guy

1556
04:02:33,530 --> 04:02:39,370
people call me the knife on account of my design containing sharp edges and how i poked my eye out

1557
04:02:39,370 --> 04:02:45,209
in a freak jack-o-lantern carving accident back in the fourth grade because i'll cut you out of

pre-teens to be honest all right what do you what do you want to do i gotta be honest with you i

1561
04:03:00,569 --> 04:03:03,930
ain't really waiting for nobody i'm just here at the bar to practice being casual and meeting

1562
04:03:03,930 --> 04:03:09,690
other folks you know in a romantical like manner but i always seem to say the wrong thing and scare

1566
04:03:25,459 --> 04:03:31,530
practice or something wait a minute that ain't a bad idea if i could just find a buddy to practice

1579
04:04:56,100 --> 04:05:02,680
humor and a big heart and between you and me she said he's a real dragon in the dojima if you

1580
04:05:02,680 --> 04:05:09,020
catch my drift i wonder what she told him about me while this negative thinking is messing with

1581
04:05:09,020 --> 04:05:14,780
my mojo he seemed like the strong silent type and you're cute enough that it intimidates me
