1
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:25,989
Oh hello, pardon me just one moment. Good to see you again, all of you. Of course you know who I am, I know who you are.

2
00:00:25,989 --> 00:00:39,479
It's me, B.F. Mugleberry. You're still your favorite person in the world. I am here to show you a few wonderful, magical things.

3
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:48,890
Three of which, don't want to drop my magical potions, but what is it? What's the matter?

4
00:00:50,859 --> 00:01:06,439
There's too much reverb, like me. I haven't even gotten started yet, just give me one moment.

5
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:18,519
Oh, just hold on, wait just a second, hold on a minute. Reverb, that's what he said.

6
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:38,170
Hold the book upside down for God's sake. Reverb, reverb, reverb. Thank you. The smell of diminishing echo.

7
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:54,939
Take that very quickly. That's one tablespoon of riboflavin. That's good. Is that even correct? I believe it was.

8
00:01:55,019 --> 00:02:24,330
One dash of mouth droppings. A batwing, which I have here somewhere. Batwing, leviton, and of course cave moss.

9
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:40,580
Cave moss from a cave that I have explored, all these ingredients I've explored, many times over, just like that.

10
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:49,960
Now this should. I know, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. Everybody relax. Hold on.

11
00:02:50,680 --> 00:03:06,120
With one touch of the head. One, two, three, get it. As they say, bottoms up.

12
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:43,770
Hello. Can anybody hear me? Can anybody hear what I'm saying? Hello. Yes. Are we fixed? Is it better?

13
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:48,650
Oh, that is such a breakthrough. That's quite a breakthrough.

14
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:55,639
The spell of diminishing echo. I have to write that. Make sure it's etched with blood.

15
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:03,560
Anyways, let me just briefly tell you what we're doing now that you can possibly understand.

16
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:10,919
As you know, I'm B.F. Bugalberry. I'm here to show you my cauldron of acid, my cauldron of demonic fluid.

17
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:19,560
And in this we will be creating spells, monsters, creatures of the likes of which you have absolutely

18
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:27,079
never seen. I can guarantee you that one. I'm your host Bugalberry. Let us begin, shall we?

19
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:35,319
The first recipe that I would like to create for you is one that I'm sure you're going to be very

20
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:45,740
interested in. It is a spell, a secret drink that everyone knows the ingredients to. I'll

21
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:51,370
start with a little bit of nutmeg. Nutmeg flavoring. Oh, no, that's not right. That's

22
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:57,990
musk of muskrat. Gotta get that one right, Bugalberry. This is it. Make sure I have the label

23
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:09,300
right. Yes, this is nutmeg. A dash of nutmeg into the cauldron it goes, whisking, filling,

24
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:18,889
screaming in a way, yearning for its brothers and sisters to join the pot with it.

25
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:27,660
Next is lemon lime peel. There's a lemon peel here. And we go like this. We go, bam! We go, bam!

26
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:38,620
Up next, there's two ounces of corn syrup, which I believe this is. We have some flavored corn syrup

27
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:53,560
there. It is a dash, a dash of caramel coloring. Just this way here. There it is, a dash of caramel

28
00:05:53,560 --> 00:06:05,139
color. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. There we go. And then we stir, stir.

29
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:12,360
We end up with a beverage that I trust you will put this down. I really want to get into this one

30
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:20,629
here. What do those witches say? What do those witches say? Double, double, toil and trouble.

31
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:27,959
We don't actually say that, you know. We don't actually do those things. Why would we say double,

32
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:33,160
double, toil and trouble? I don't understand. It doesn't make any sense to me.

33
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:47,990
Oh, there it is. I believe it's ready to test. So, let's see how it comes out.

34
00:06:57,029 --> 00:07:10,410
Looks like it's the right color. Has a good smell. Give it a taste. Just like the real

35
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:14,329
thing. I bet you can't tell a difference. I bet you couldn't tell a difference.

36
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:23,290
Let me upload this to YouTube on a science channel. This is technically a science channel now.

37
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:30,180
I mean, I am creating all kinds of spells and creatures that you will see very soon.

38
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:41,370
That's the recipe for not hola. Don't want to say the first seed word. Just to help get arrested.

39
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:54,870
So, coming up next. Oh, if you wondered, ladies and gentlemen, where the characters

40
00:07:56,019 --> 00:08:05,160
that Gerber creates, where they come from. Oh, do I have news for you? He has nothing to do with it.

41
00:08:06,149 --> 00:08:12,629
He commissions me and I create the creatures. I create the characters and I create

42
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:19,509
many other things that he uses. Don't let him fool you. Don't let him do that. So,

43
00:08:19,509 --> 00:08:24,470
we're going to make some now because that's why I'm here. I'm here to show you the process.

44
00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:32,360
Look, my thinking, how I do things when I create these characters. The first character we're going

45
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:41,659
to make, we'll see. I want to see if you can guess who they are before they come out. First up,

46
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:53,220
we're going to use, let me get it right, one walrus whiskey. And it's been dehydrated

47
00:08:54,730 --> 00:09:11,659
many times over. If you don't spit it, it won't work. One can of Pringles. I don't have those.

48
00:09:11,659 --> 00:09:22,840
What can I substitute? One concentrated liquid from a tomb of the 70s. This is it right here.

49
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:36,070
As you say, this is from 1976. Yeah, 1977. You can tell. This is very, very raw. Very raw.

50
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:50,490
It's very raw. The 1970s. There we go. A little extra. Then next onto this

51
00:09:51,539 --> 00:10:12,659
is wishful thinking. And the final ingredient is this. Germa's DNA. I collected this for many years

52
00:10:13,299 --> 00:10:26,360
collecting soda cans and scrubbing his toilet many times over. Plenty of Germa's DNA to create.

53
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:38,710
Let's see who we got here. We need quite a bit of this. Okay. Whoa, whoa, don't be too. Whoa,

54
00:10:38,789 --> 00:10:45,830
hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Oh, it's starting to get windy. It's starting to get

55
00:10:45,830 --> 00:11:05,429
windy. Come on. Rise. Rise. Mustache Germa.

56
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:43,659
Why do I keep saying that? Let's go. Yeah, go. No, character registration is on your right.

57
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:54,970
Go that way. No. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. That way. Yes. Oh, he's an idiot. He put very much brain

58
00:11:54,970 --> 00:12:07,620
and power in that. Our next character that we will be creating, this is a popular one. Let's start

59
00:12:08,259 --> 00:12:15,419
the process. I've got to keep this moving. Five percent. Not that one. Not that one.

60
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:28,139
There it is. Five percent of every children's Halloween costume. Yes. A pinch. A small pinch

61
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:39,529
of mouse droppings. We'll be using these quite frequently. That was more than a pinch. Hey.

62
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:56,169
That wasn't part of the recipe. I just wanted to see what that felt like.

63
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:11,879
It felt pretty good. Strange. Very strange. Anyways, a pinch of purple liquid. This is blue,

64
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:29,129
but we put red in already. Of course, children's DNA should be used very frequently. As you see it

65
00:13:29,129 --> 00:13:36,409
pilling, bubbling again like it always does. Mesmerizing. Hypnotizing goes. I'm weak of men,

66
00:13:36,409 --> 00:13:54,139
but I am not a weak man. A strong man. And then all we need to do is wait. Stir. And that will

67
00:13:54,139 --> 00:14:29,350
give us. Oh, who do you think will be that character? Arise. Arise. I don't think that's

68
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:34,230
going to make it that far. I'm not even quite sure a German will be able to use that one.

69
00:14:35,769 --> 00:14:43,960
It's not that different. Kind of. I tried. Maybe he'll make it. And then it is his DNA.

70
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:58,570
Coming up next. We have a good one. The first on this list is protein powder. Protein powder,

71
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:09,940
which I have down here somewhere. We can use mouse droppings. Protein powder. This protein

72
00:15:10,419 --> 00:15:20,039
droppings. You just don't know it. A small dash of testosterone. Lots of it. There it is. Lots of

73
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:37,399
it. A little bit of vitamin D3, which is this one here. Yes, it is vitamin D3. Make sure you take

74
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:42,440
that by the way. Not enough people get vitamin D in their diet and they don't go into the sun

75
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:49,929
to get the sunshine. You need more vitamin D. Go get it. It prevents a lot of things. Helps you

76
00:15:49,929 --> 00:15:59,340
with the cold, the blues. Makes you feel good. A little bit of tanning lotion, which I believe I

77
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:15,159
have some down here. Tanning lotion. Oh yes, yes, yes. There we are. If you didn't know tanning

78
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:22,169
lotion was made from fig leaves. Don't know how accurate that is, but this is not a science.

79
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:41,799
A little bit of kosher salt. A little bit of kosher salt. And finally, the DNA. Oh, that was

80
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:52,970
way too close to my face. Yeah, but please arise. Whatever you have been, whatever you have been,

81
00:16:52,970 --> 00:17:02,519
whatever you will do, arise. Oh, this is a big one. He's a big boy. That's a big boy.

82
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:28,140
Of course, that's muscle germ. Here's a big guy. Very strong. You know, it probably takes a long

83
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:33,579
time in the gym unless you know me. Unless you know me and I can make a clone of you.

84
00:17:34,299 --> 00:17:39,579
Then you can just send your clone in to go out in the town and people will think it was you

85
00:17:39,579 --> 00:17:43,500
and you're gonna sit there and just go like this on your computer and nobody will know it was you.

86
00:17:46,279 --> 00:18:01,210
So, the next one. I've been waiting to create this for a few months now at least.

87
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:12,470
I was told that this was an important character. Let's go ahead and start with the catnip.

88
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:24,940
Not new very much. Just a little bit of catnip. Kitties love it. Some humans do too.

89
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:42,950
A pinch of catnip. A small amount of Lynx venom. The most powerful destructive substances on earth.

90
00:18:43,829 --> 00:18:52,660
Just a drop will kill a donkey. Don't ask me why we always use that term. Don't ask me why a donkey

91
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:58,920
has to be the thing we kill to determine how poisonous something is. Oh, it's enough to kill

92
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:07,220
a horse. Why are you killing a horse? What's wrong with you? You don't understand. You're killing demons.

93
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:21,509
Ridiculous. Up next we have, what is next? Can't read any of my glasses. Some water on it. Up next

94
00:19:21,509 --> 00:19:42,230
we have, hair of the bobcat. And finally, oh, Gemma's DNA. I might put something else in here too.

95
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:52,519
Right now Gemma's DNA. What will we create this time? Arise. Doesn't even need stirring. It's

96
00:19:52,519 --> 00:20:05,140
ready. It's just the chemicals reacting into each other. Come on up, catboy German.

97
00:20:14,779 --> 00:20:27,180
Where am I? I don't need to wink into the spirit. Why? Ow, my head. My brain just hurt.

98
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:37,609
Where? What the fuck is happening? What? Do I know who you are? This way. Bye-bye. Registration.

99
00:20:37,609 --> 00:20:45,720
Registration. Character registration over there. Talk to Lucy. Talk to Lucy. Lucy, she's waving at

100
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:55,289
you. Yes, Lucy, thank you. The next character we'll be creating is a silly one. Oh, it's cold,

101
00:20:55,289 --> 00:21:08,339
I think. One, two, three, four, four dehydrated frozen ice cubes. I dropped it because it was

102
00:21:08,339 --> 00:21:18,470
too cold and I got it in. Wow, wowee. That was very, very cold. Too cold. Too cold. A little

103
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:30,539
bit of kosher salt. The fangs of the ever-living dragon like we used previously. A little diarrhea

104
00:21:30,619 --> 00:21:40,519
potion or whatever it was. And then all it takes is a very simple potion, very simple brew,

105
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:58,410
a little bit more of, you guessed it. It's getting cold. It's getting chilly in here. Anybody else

106
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:32,250
feel a breeze? Does anybody else feel a slight breeze? Wow, that was cool. That was cool, man.

107
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:45,369
Oh, don't do that actually. That was cool. I know some of you do. I see it. I see it right there.

108
00:22:45,369 --> 00:22:49,640
That was a good joke. Thank you. I do them better than the guy that owns this place.

109
00:22:52,220 --> 00:23:02,569
So the final creature we're going to make, you don't even need the book. We're going freestyle on

110
00:23:02,569 --> 00:23:20,220
this one. Rink stuff. Crumping kitty liver. Catnip. Mush of the buscrap. I don't even have a recipe

111
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:31,559
for this one. Ocean water. The caramel coloring. We are going to get something extraordinary.

112
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:37,220
Oops. It's all right. It's all right. It was just a catnip. That stuff's pretty cheap.

113
00:23:38,099 --> 00:23:53,589
It's not, it's not this stuff. Don't drop this stuff. I stirred up. What are we going to get?

114
00:23:53,589 --> 00:24:05,640
I want to create my own creature. My own creation. And what is it? What is it? I feel

115
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:11,559
like I'm playing Monster Rancher. I saw those terminated by strings. They were pretty good.

116
00:24:13,829 --> 00:24:26,569
Whoa. What is it? Oh, dear. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, no. This is horrible. Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

117
00:24:27,529 --> 00:24:32,250
Oh, he's, oh, he's coming after me. He's, oh, he's fighting. Okay, I've got to be ready for this.

118
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:38,890
Hey, I didn't even, I didn't even give him a name. What was his name? I don't even know what he was

119
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:48,309
doing. Why would he attack me? A fish bastard. I don't even know what I did, but I keep putting

120
00:24:48,309 --> 00:24:56,119
my hands in here and it feels, it burned for a little while the first few minutes of this dream.

121
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:05,460
You're going to track him down Lucy. He's on the loose. Oh, it hurts, but it doesn't hurt at the

122
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:13,990
same time. It's very odd. Lucy, I'm going to do something here that might, I don't,

123
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:23,220
when they were coming out, it looks comfortable. Oh, oh, oh, it hurts a lot. It hurts a lot,

124
00:25:24,019 --> 00:25:36,970
but something about this is, oh, I, something's missing though. I like it, but I feel like I

125
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:45,180
should be more comfortable. I feel like the atmosphere needs to change. My, my mindset needs

126
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:53,589
to change. I'm getting this strong, incredible urge to receive donations and subscriptions.

127
00:25:54,599 --> 00:26:01,690
I don't even know what that means. I don't even, I, I, I've only ever streamed with German once,

128
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:12,819
twice maybe. I feel so good right now. Oh, something about this. I could get used to this.

129
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:29,130
Hot diggity dog. Lucy, get all this shit out of here. Clear this out. I want, I, I want to

130
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:34,539
hang out with the chat now. I want to hang out with everybody over here. I want to give them,

131
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:44,859
yeah, clear this out. I want you to get rid of that stuff. Get rid of it. Thank you. No, no,

132
00:26:44,859 --> 00:27:12,380
go off the back door. Go off the back door. Don't drop any of those. Don't drop any of

133
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:20,980
those potions. I saw you. You have no idea how hard it took. That was, that's 5,500,000 years

134
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:36,519
of my life. What do we do? Did somebody say I was muted? Muted? Are we muted? I was just

135
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:43,480
yelling at the people with my potions. I said, don't drop them. They just picked them up and

136
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:54,259
walked out of here. They went, they went too fast is what they did. But, uh, this is kind of nice.

137
00:27:54,259 --> 00:28:05,619
What should we do now? I mean, this wheel is here. I wonder if we should use it. Should we use the

138
00:28:05,619 --> 00:28:19,960
wheel? What's on here? We have, if we can get, can we get a closer, closer view of this? But

139
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:28,539
should we have a reason for this to be on here? Yeah, let's put, put an overlay on. Why don't we

140
00:28:28,539 --> 00:28:42,650
make it fun? Let's make it fun. Oh, this is pretty nice. Five subs for a name on a ball.

141
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:52,890
Ten subs for your name on my body, which I'm gonna have to take this off eventually. 20 subs

142
00:28:52,890 --> 00:29:01,769
for a dance party. Oh, I bet you want to see that. Oh, it's nice in here. Without the cauldron

143
00:29:01,769 --> 00:29:11,640
bubbling. Why not? Why not? Without the cauldron bubbling, it's actually pretty nice. I really

144
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:18,789
hope that that fish face guy, hope they catch him. I feel like I have a scratch this big,

145
00:29:18,789 --> 00:29:35,670
right here, right there. Wait, hold on a second. Did you just say that every single thing has been

146
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:45,460
redeemed? It happened already? It's only, how many subs was it? It happened already? Oh,

147
00:29:46,099 --> 00:29:55,059
this is very liquidy. Very liquidy. Already? I haven't even gotten my cool shirt on yet.

148
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:00,920
Well, we're gonna have to get their names down.

149
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:17,400
Apparently, people love me. Well, let's hope we can get all those on the body before we continue.

150
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:26,069
How do I even put this on? Oh, this is good on the back, too. This feels good.

151
00:30:29,859 --> 00:30:37,819
I haven't even gotten the shirt on. How many? Can you even count?

152
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:59,289
Wow. My days of potion making should be effectively over. Oh, we got some names. Oh,

153
00:30:59,289 --> 00:31:11,900
there it goes. Community Jake, could you come over here? I don't even have the shirt on. Thank you.

154
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:19,109
Community Jake. See, I can hire him, too. I can hire him, too. I'll go over these names in just a

155
00:31:19,109 --> 00:31:39,450
second. We should have to spin the wheel four times. I'm just gonna lay it on like this. What the

156
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:48,470
hell? Oh, we have called me false. Thank you so much for your 10 community subs. Also,

157
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:59,019
the great Canadian FK Nug. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. Thank yous to Tippedover.

158
00:31:59,019 --> 00:32:13,910
Wow. That's your name on a ball. I'm gonna say people's names twice. Oh, don't look at that.

159
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:25,130
Don't look at that. This is not. Don't look at that. Daddy? Oh, no, it's Daddy Big Box.

160
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:35,829
That's kind of comedic if you think about it. It's pretty comedic. Blind Irene 1. Thank you,

161
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:47,799
Blind Irene. Poly Hex. Thank you. Wow. I'm gonna put this in again. Let's do this here.

162
00:32:50,069 --> 00:32:54,950
Oh, and we also have the eco leech. Thank you. There's no more of these remaining, by the way.

163
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:10,470
At this point, we didn't get enough balls to do this with. Throw them in. Good. Good. All right.

164
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:19,799
All that went in the eye. Fames. Wow. Fames, thank you so much for those 10 community subs.

165
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:26,710
Who else we have? Cherry Rowlett. Wow. Thank you for those 10 community subs.

166
00:33:27,349 --> 00:33:35,779
Shinomi. Thank you for those 10 community subs. Oh, oh, but I can't.

167
00:33:37,299 --> 00:33:51,940
Oh, it's too much. I can't get up and spin the wheel. Let's do it. That's 8 Bugs. That's 8 Bugs,

168
00:33:51,940 --> 00:34:06,099
my favorite. Oh, I love Bugs. Give me a few Bugs. Did I get them by the way? Are we good?

169
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:23,719
Oh, this is what I'm talking about. Delicious Bugs. Oh, that's unbelievably delicious. Again.

170
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:45,909
Oh, that's a random potion. The microphone is wet, apparently. What's in this one? This looks

171
00:34:46,309 --> 00:34:57,739
manna. It's like it's under water. Can you hear? I can hear it. It just sucks. Oh, well.

172
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:18,599
Oh, shoot. I have to write somebody's name on my face.

173
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:55,030
How am I going to write that? That's impossible. Let me do it. Please take this. Storms and shadows.

174
00:35:55,030 --> 00:36:13,030
You're going to go right here. Let's see. Oh, geez. It's been quite difficult. I don't. Oh,

175
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:38,940
that's an E. This is literally not possible. I need an S. The aliens find us one day.

176
00:36:39,659 --> 00:37:00,409
It's over. Wrong way. Storm of what? Storms of... This is so hard. You have no idea.

177
00:37:00,409 --> 00:37:15,769
I'm drawing backwards. Storms of shadow. You get the idea, okay? I still have a bug in my mouth.

178
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:38,920
I lost it. Where'd it go? I don't even know who that was.

179
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:50,820
I need to swallow this thing in my mouth, okay? Somebody said damaged?

180
00:37:55,690 --> 00:38:07,690
Swallowed. Just that simple. Oh, Shinobi. Did we get Shinobi already? What did I not get? Oh,

181
00:38:07,769 --> 00:38:19,380
I'm sorry. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Is this 15? A feed line.

182
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:24,760
Feed line defined. Thank you from a 10 community sub. Do I have to write that on my face?

183
00:38:25,829 --> 00:38:36,550
Oh, okay. Vertix. Thank you. Clavicle. Thank you. And hello, my name is Blank. Thank you.

184
00:38:37,269 --> 00:38:41,429
Let me try to move the... Do you want to come adjust the microphone?

185
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:58,840
Give me the microphone adjuster. That's my neck. Ow. Ow. Ow. Okay. How does that sound? Is that

186
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:08,860
better? I sound like Bane. What does that mean? I don't know who that is. Your skin, your neck skin

187
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:19,929
is peeling. They're saved. Saved. Okay. Thank you. We have some more to read. I need to spin the wheel

188
00:39:19,929 --> 00:39:25,019
a few more times. We did not anticipate this many people were going to actually do this,

189
00:39:25,659 --> 00:39:35,269
so we were not very well prepared. Sentry J Man. Thank you, Sentry J Man. Appreciate it.

190
00:39:35,269 --> 00:39:47,320
Master Mudkips. Thank you. Chef Lazarus. Thank you. And real anime hours. Thank you so much.

191
00:39:47,320 --> 00:40:07,380
So who do I need to put on my body? Where is that marker? Oh. Call me false. Call me false.

192
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:16,860
Okay. There you are. Call me false. And then Blind Irene. Oh, interesting. Blind Irene

193
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:30,679
one. And then who? Ego. What's it again? Sorry. My hearing's not as good. Ego Leech. Okay. Ego

194
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:48,650
Leech. Olly Hex. Olly Hex. Okay. Daddy Big Bugs. Is this what people do? I'm running out of room.

195
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:59,960
I'm running out of space already. Where do you put it? There we are. Fanes. Okay.

196
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:07,929
And this is not coming off. This shirt's not coming off. Sorry about that, all of you.

197
00:41:07,929 --> 00:41:21,030
Fanes. Chevrolet. Real anime hours. I'm going to go on the other arm. Why not? What? Real anime

198
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:25,750
hours. What are people saying? Do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to take this off.

199
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:32,679
Out of your mind? Have you lost your mind? You already got the scene of the abominable snowman

200
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:46,139
pretty much naked. That's not enough for you. What was it again? Real anime hours. Real anime

201
00:41:47,769 --> 00:41:56,280
hours. Well, I did my best. I just keep on wrecking. All right. I can't do this anymore.

202
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:07,130
What was that? Century J-Man. Century J-Man. This thing's running out of ink. Take a look,

203
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:17,559
everybody. Those are your names on me. He removed the jorts. Okay. All right. That was interesting.

204
00:42:17,559 --> 00:42:23,739
Century J-Man and all of you. I hope nobody heard that. I really hope nobody heard that

205
00:42:23,739 --> 00:42:29,059
because that was awful. That was awful. It was absolutely horrible. Please tell me no one heard

206
00:42:29,059 --> 00:42:42,019
that noise. Nobody did. All right. No more writing on body. I'll do right on face. I'm not writing

207
00:42:42,019 --> 00:42:47,699
on body anymore. You can't do this. I know about potions. I know how things work. I know if you do

208
00:42:47,699 --> 00:42:57,980
this too much, you could get you sick. It'll make you sick. I'm not doing it. What is this? Red

209
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:02,619
Riolu. We did not anticipate this many. We thought we were going to spin the wheel three times.

210
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:11,530
We didn't think we were going to spin the wheel like five times. Sedata. Thank you. Red Riolu.

211
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:20,860
Thank you. What else we have here? Sculptor. Sculptor. What else we have? Forklifter. Wow.

212
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:31,260
Selling out. Is this what it is? Selling out. Selling out feels pretty good. E-Himbo.

213
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:45,239
This is the one that I just grabbed. This is quite, quite the image I would say.

214
00:43:46,219 --> 00:43:59,179
Quite the image I would say. We got 100 subs. Oh, God. E-Himbo. Okay. Let's spin the wheel.

215
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:05,139
It's very hard to keep track of and keep up with it, but we're going to try. Let's see if we can

216
00:44:05,139 --> 00:44:24,119
get something here. That's the question. You see, when we originally envisioned this stream,

217
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:33,110
I thought maybe, maybe we would have people ask me questions, but when 2,000 people subscribe

218
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:43,289
at the same time in 15 to 20 minutes, that becomes not possible anymore. What's the question?

219
00:44:44,659 --> 00:44:46,019
Did I fart in the tub?

220
00:44:57,429 --> 00:45:11,030
Does that answer your question? All right. I need to do things. 50 more subs. What's the name?

221
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:19,989
Freddie Dredd, the musician. I'm just going to use this because it's easier. Oh, you have it

222
00:45:19,989 --> 00:45:29,530
right there. Freddie Dredd, the musician. Very talented young man. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. You're

223
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:38,090
going to have to go down somewhere on the neck area. Riding backwards and sideways,

224
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:53,829
mirrored. It should be a special skill. It should be like at the Olympics. Oh, actually,

225
00:45:53,829 --> 00:46:13,659
that makes it a little easier. E. Oh, shit. Fuck. F-R-E. D. How did he do this? How did people do

226
00:46:13,659 --> 00:46:18,710
this? It's not possible. It's not possible to do this. It's impossible. It really is.

227
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:34,019
Fred. Freddie Dredd. I like your last name, if that is your real name. E. F. Bugleberry is mine.

228
00:46:34,019 --> 00:46:54,599
Stands for Barry Fennard Bugleberry. I do. Okay. Let's see. Freddie Dredd. Good. Very good. H. F.

229
00:46:54,599 --> 00:47:21,300
S. K. A. H. Oh, man. H. F. S. H. F. S. K. A. K. A. F. H. F. H. F. H. This is painful.

230
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:28,789
J. D. A. I got scammed. Oh, yeah, I'm scammed. Oh, I'm the scammer.

231
00:47:29,719 --> 00:47:41,269
Oh. Did you just say that there was a phone call? Somebody was trying to call? Who's calling?

232
00:47:41,269 --> 00:47:48,309
You said 50 seconds before that. You said there was a phone call. Is that German? Hey, what's up?

233
00:47:48,309 --> 00:47:56,219
Did you make the characters yet? Yes. Did you make the characters? The new characters?

234
00:47:56,219 --> 00:47:59,900
Yes, I made them. Of course I did. That is all you are supposed to be doing.

235
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:06,059
I can't just hang out. I don't want you sitting around in a tub on the street. All right? I don't

236
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:08,780
want to die. It's a cauldron. Get out. Get out. You're done. You're done.

237
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:11,900
I'm not done. It's a cauldron. No, you're done. You're done. Get out of the hot tub.

238
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:14,469
It's not a hot tub. It's a hot tub. That's what it looks like. Get out.

239
00:48:14,469 --> 00:48:16,949
He's just pissed because he's not getting the money. How much money did you make?

240
00:48:16,949 --> 00:48:19,829
That's right, yeah. Too much. I get some of that money.

241
00:48:19,829 --> 00:48:22,150
No, you don't. I get at least half of that money.

242
00:48:22,789 --> 00:48:27,510
No. No, he doesn't. Not at all. Hang up on him.

243
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:29,670
Nothing to do with anything. Hang up on him.

244
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:32,070
This is not what we agreed to. Hang up on him.

245
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:36,150
Just get out. Thank you, everyone. Thank you, Bugleberry. It was really nice to see you.

246
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:46,820
Shut up. Hang up on him. Did you hang up? Good. When he calls back, don't answer again.

247
00:48:47,719 --> 00:48:52,920
He can come down here if he has a problem. Oh, I'm making money. Oh, that's what it's about.

248
00:48:52,920 --> 00:49:00,340
He's annoyed that I'm making more money than he is. What a fucking joke. That was not a fart,

249
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:06,699
I swear to God. That was not a fart. It looked like it, but it wasn't. It kind of did look like

250
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:14,820
it. It sounded like it, too, if that picked up. Oh, what have we got here? More balls. Let's see

251
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:24,550
them. Well, he could do this if he really wanted to. Why is it my problem? Is there a lot coming in?

252
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:37,719
Oh, shit. I cannot read these all. I cannot read these. Freddy Dread gets a ball. He's on my face.

253
00:49:38,519 --> 00:49:48,489
How does he get a ball? He has the whole real estate. Fanches, thank you.

254
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:59,449
Ghost Pop Live, thank you. Hey, Kip, thank you. Three more in the face. Oh, I think we have two

255
00:49:59,449 --> 00:50:41,940
mics on. Oh, who's got a question? I'm not trying to scam, I promise. Aaron, what is that? What's

256
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:48,840
Aaron? What's Aaron? What is that? What's Aaron? Why are they saying that? Oh, I think we lost one

257
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:53,929
of our lights. I think one of our lights got screwed up. Hey, here's a question for you.

258
00:50:53,929 --> 00:51:07,989
Why the fuck are we doing this? How's that one? What is my height, Bugleberry? I'm six foot four.

259
00:51:07,989 --> 00:51:17,739
I'm not German at all. I'm up here and he's down here. I'm not German. Oh, these are the ones that

260
00:51:17,739 --> 00:51:32,119
go on the face. Holy smokes, hold on. What is that one? Question. Any more questions? Oh,

261
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:49,590
I'm not going to be able to do this. Okay, so we have Vinsmore. Vins. Oh my God. Vinsmoke. Vinsmoke.

262
00:51:49,590 --> 00:52:07,019
Vinsmoke. Metalzalor. Metalzalor. What'd you say? Metalzalor. Hold on. Metalzalor. That's right.

263
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:14,059
And then Goikki. Goikki, I'll put you up here. By the way, I just want to make this clear. I'll

264
00:52:14,059 --> 00:52:26,869
say it in a second. Goikki. Here you are. Goikki. Excellent work. It just looks like the original.

265
00:52:26,869 --> 00:52:37,030
It looks like old caveman paintings. This is Grug. My name's Grug. After paying for production

266
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:43,269
and paying for the people that are kind enough to be spending their time here, the remaining

267
00:52:43,269 --> 00:52:49,480
proceeds of this stream will be given to charity. I want to make that very clear. So, I'm going to

268
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:56,440
be giving this to charity. I'm not going to be taking this. It's time for a dance party. Oh,

269
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:16,329
dance party. Play the music. Hold on. What the hell is that?

270
00:53:25,989 --> 00:53:42,519
What is this? What the hell? I don't know how that happened. Man, that hurt.

271
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:54,170
Should we spin the wheel again? Is the water warm? Yeah, it is. It's perfect for me.

272
00:53:55,590 --> 00:54:09,929
Negative 15 degrees Celsius. That's nice and warm for me. Stand up. Oh, no, no, no. I don't stand up.

273
00:54:09,929 --> 00:54:15,500
I will spin the wheel again and hopefully we land on something besides Question. Maybe Question

274
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:21,059
should have been something we made small. That's my fault. I should not have made Question big.

275
00:54:21,699 --> 00:54:30,940
Figured it would be easy. Let's go. That's foam. Time for a foam party.

276
00:54:52,699 --> 00:55:15,690
Hold on. This looks really, really ridiculous. That's 2,000 subs. I just rolled around for 20

277
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:25,030
minutes. Who is this? Goo Berry Juice. Well, I dropped the marker in the hot tub. Hopefully,

278
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:29,769
we can get that out with a little bit of elbow grease. Goo Berry Juice.

279
00:55:36,230 --> 00:55:42,980
Goo Berry Juice. Okay. That was directly into the eye socket. Thank God I'm already dead.

280
00:55:43,909 --> 00:55:53,559
I'm an undead demon. I can handle it. Goo Berry a boat. I think it's time to end the names on

281
00:55:53,559 --> 00:56:03,079
face. We're running out of room and I'm very wet. Goo Berry, we'll get you right here. Goo. Oh,

282
00:56:03,079 --> 00:56:28,869
my God. Goo Berry. This looks like two musical notes. Goo Berry Juice. There you go. Goo Berry

283
00:56:28,869 --> 00:56:41,880
Juice. You don't understand. I'm very wet and this is wet too. This mask. What mask? This mask

284
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:50,039
is going to be... Why are you saying that? You're talking about my skin. Weird, weird people on this

285
00:56:50,039 --> 00:57:02,440
community. I sweat my arse off making characters for you to enjoy. You know how much I get paid

286
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:12,389
for it? 40 bucks a character. 40 bucks. Oh, Gerber, don't do that hot tub stream. Don't do

287
00:57:12,389 --> 00:57:20,630
the hot tub thing. It's a cauldron, first of all. What? I would rather give it to charity.

288
00:57:21,289 --> 00:57:31,929
This is what I'm doing. It's Shinoli. I'm going to do Shinoli on the cheek. What on the chin?

289
00:57:31,929 --> 00:57:55,030
Shinoli. Shinoli. Fix the S. What's the other one? Captain Nemo. Captain. Hello, Captain Nemo.

290
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:08,550
I keep laughing really hard, but this looks like a three-year-old's bedroom wall that he would get

291
00:58:08,550 --> 00:58:29,699
in trouble over. This is just... You got into the crayons. Let's spin the wheel. Oh no, not again.

292
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:46,309
It got in the eye again. How? How did that happen twice? Spray it in the tub. In the tub. In the tub.

293
00:58:46,309 --> 00:59:01,880
Inside. How did it happen twice? Okay, I might need a small towel. It happened twice. Thank you,

294
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:17,960
Community Jake. Thank you. Oh, goodness gracious. I can't wait to see the out-of-context Twitter

295
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:32,840
tonight. Oh, boy. Just throw them in. Let's do another spin. Pinata time. It's time for the

296
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:50,730
pinata. All right, let's go. Okay, here it comes. The pinata. Oh, I got it. I got it.

297
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:07,159
All right, take it back. The pinata just broke his neck. That's all I did. He didn't have any candy

298
01:00:07,159 --> 01:00:18,920
in it. That was just awful. His neck just fell down. Get him out of frame. Get him out of frame.

299
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:26,199
No, I don't want to. I don't want to. Look at him. He's very sad. Hold on. I'll fix him.

300
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:49,239
I'll fix him. Take it away. Take it away. Spin it again. Why don't we? Another random potion.

301
01:00:51,159 --> 01:01:06,230
Interesting. Oh, what's this one? Yellow. It's like eggs. It smells like eggs.

302
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:19,659
Tastes like eggs too, but I like that. Oh, you know what I would do with this? I would drizzle

303
01:01:19,659 --> 01:01:27,219
this on top of a piece of toast. Put an avocado on it. Oh, that would be scrumptious. You can take

304
01:01:27,219 --> 01:01:39,190
that from me. You're probably noticing there's a small sliver here. I don't want to burp. Mute

305
01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:49,800
my microphone. Mute my microphone. Did you make that? Did you lie or did you actually mute it?

306
01:01:49,800 --> 01:02:00,920
Good. Good boy. So you're noticing there's a small sliver here. If that hits, it says apocalypse on

307
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:07,420
it. Oh, and you know what that means? That means we are done here. Oh, look at that. Look at that

308
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:22,260
nerd neck. I've heard that German has used that term before. Let's try. Get another one. Eat bugs

309
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:31,429
again. Eat more bugs. Just give me one of the little ones. One of these little guys here.

310
01:02:32,150 --> 01:02:48,250
Okay. Holy shit. These are good. I really actually. Hold on. I'll get it. I'll get it.

311
01:02:48,250 --> 01:03:07,349
I'll fix it. Wait. There we go. These are very creamy. I would just throw them in. You're going

312
01:03:07,349 --> 01:03:14,150
to eat the bugs. You eat the bugs. You will eat the bugs. You will eat the bugs while you're saying

313
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:23,460
what's worse. Turtle. It's not even a bug. It's a turtle.

314
01:03:33,289 --> 01:03:45,480
Oh no. Everything is sold out. Oh no. Oh, it's all sold out. Why don't we spin the wheel one more

315
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:51,340
time? Huh? Again, everything's going to charity from my portion. I'm going to be paying the

316
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:57,369
production staff handsomely. And then all of my portion from this stream is going to charity.

317
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:03,210
I wonder what's going to happen if we spin the wheel again. What do you think is going to happen?

318
01:04:09,289 --> 01:04:27,900
Falling backwards. Don't end the stream. Let's hang out for five more minutes.

319
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:39,989
Let's see if I can read some of these names. That's xsparter45. Oh my God, a human. Thank you.

320
01:04:39,989 --> 01:04:44,579
So what I want to do is I want to take a picture of this. I want to get them all out,

321
01:04:44,579 --> 01:04:50,730
take a photo of it. I'll retweet it out. That sounds fun to me. If they'll do that in the next

322
01:04:50,730 --> 01:05:00,440
day or so. I'll ask Jerma if it's okay. PPSlap. Thank you. Oh, tipped over. I think we got that

323
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:19,750
one already. Somebody said our stream Andy. Our stream Andy. Who's Andy? We did not anticipate

324
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:28,139
this amount of things happening. We only had enough stuff for like 25 people. I don't know why we

325
01:05:28,139 --> 01:05:45,849
thought that that was going to work. Oh, it's time to spin the wheel. What's it landing on?

326
01:05:46,659 --> 01:05:54,739
Oh shit, it landed on apocalypse. I'll see you all soon. Don't worry. We'll get out of this together.

327
01:05:54,739 --> 01:06:01,320
Thank you. Let me just be really clear before the world ends. This was a fun little joke,

328
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:09,719
but I hope you enjoyed it. I appreciate you hanging out here, everybody. We'll get a nice

329
01:06:09,719 --> 01:06:23,610
photo of all the subs from today. Oh shit. Get this off camera right now. Get it off camera.

330
01:06:27,690 --> 01:06:49,099
Did we miss anybody up here? He was rigged. Ocean dweller. Ocean dweller. Should we get him up here

331
01:06:49,099 --> 01:07:03,260
too? Let's get him up there. We want to get at least those ones. He said potion dweller.

332
01:07:11,050 --> 01:07:35,059
Ocean dweller. And that's all the fifties. Okay. Ocean dweller. All the people on the arms,

333
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:39,849
I'll give you a special thanks very soon. I'll write it on my arm another day.

334
01:07:40,409 --> 01:07:47,820
We didn't anticipate this many people. Thank you everybody. Have a great rest of your evening.

335
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:50,679
We're out of here.
