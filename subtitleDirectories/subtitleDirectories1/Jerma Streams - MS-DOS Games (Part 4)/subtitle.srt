1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:11,320
Hello everybody. Welcome, welcome. I did hear, I did hear about it. I've seen it. It's crazy.

2
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:17,609
I guess we'll open with that. Uh, so the TF2 economy has, uh, doesn't exist anymore.

3
00:00:18,739 --> 00:00:25,690
Unusuals are just free. Everybody gets one? Yeah, I saw that. They're gonna fix it though, right?

4
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,920
They're gonna pull back any item that's been opened in the last, like, day or so.

5
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:43,000
They'll do an unusual rollback period and then everybody that sold their $3,000 TF2 hat

6
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:49,350
for like three bucks. That might not, that's gonna, that's just hold on to your stuff. Just hold.

7
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:05,670
This happened before? Yeah, it'll be, I think it'll probably be fine. It is like kind of humorous

8
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:12,250
though to see screenshots of people's backpacks with like 50 unusuals that they opened like 10

9
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:23,989
minutes ago. I don't play TF2 anymore, but it's still interesting to keep up sometimes. He's

10
00:01:23,989 --> 00:01:34,299
telling you not to sell. Don't, just don't sell. You can't panic sell. You do what we all do. You

11
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:47,659
hold that shit to zero and then sell it for 30 cents. Yeah, buy high, don't sell and then

12
00:01:48,620 --> 00:02:01,239
panic sell for less than 95% of your initial investment. Monster Rancher is getting ported,

13
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:09,180
but I heard it was Japanese only. So, and how are they gonna do that? It's gonna be digital only

14
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:23,819
port. It's just gonna, what do you do? How do you do that without the discs? We'll see. But I heard

15
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:35,219
that was only going to Japan first. So who knows if it'll ever show up in the North American market.

16
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:46,919
Who knows? When am I gonna go to Japan? I don't know. I've wanted to take a trip to Japan.

17
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:57,819
Probably since I was 16, 17. Just one of those places that I've always wanted to go.

18
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:10,969
Never had a chance. It's just an interesting place. No, it's not, it's not, it's not because

19
00:03:10,969 --> 00:03:23,460
of the anime. It's just, Japan's an interesting place. It really is. It seems really fun and

20
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:35,210
interesting. Yeah. Oh yeah. I would, I can't wait to travel to Japan because of the anime. Sure.

21
00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:46,229
Not like the incredible culture and the massive history. No, no, no, no, anime. That's why I want

22
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:59,419
to go. Anyways, speaking of none of the things we're just talking about, we're going to play

23
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:08,039
DOS games today. We're going to hang out for a little bit. I said a while ago I wanted to do

24
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:18,649
DOS nights. The last time we did this is probably three weeks ago. Maybe more. So hey, DOS night

25
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:28,300
number four or five, whatever the hell it is. And I have picked a few to start just to kind of get

26
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:35,879
the ball rolling. Play Mario Sunshine or Riot. That's not a DOS game. That is a, that is Nintendo

27
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:43,699
GameCube. That's not for Microsoft distributed online systems. What do you mean? Yes, it is.

28
00:04:47,800 --> 00:05:01,220
There's no MS DOS version of Mario Sunshine. Sunshine was ported to DOS. How? Doesn't DOS,

29
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:12,860
isn't the the entire operating system of DOS a hundred kilobytes? No, I'm getting lied to.

30
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:18,860
Anyways, let's go. I've already got it all set up. We'll do some picking later,

31
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:25,449
but I saw a couple that I just had to click on immediately. And the first one we're going to do

32
00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:32,410
is, let's see if I can get it on here. Yeah, the first one we're going to do is called Donald Ducks

33
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:42,759
Playground by the Walt Disney Company. I just saw Donald Duck and I clicked it immediately.

34
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:59,420
Okay, here we go. Let's get it on here. Are you going to work? Please work. Please work. Please

35
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:47,779
work. Please work. There we go. Donald Ducks Playground. What are we doing? Oh, Donald wants

36
00:06:47,779 --> 00:07:07,500
to build a playground in the park for his nephews. He works in these stores to earn money. Hey, here's

37
00:07:07,579 --> 00:07:12,279
the word. All right, let's go. He works at the train station.

38
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:52,579
Donald buys toys for today. How do I play? When words appear here, press the enter key or a

39
00:07:52,579 --> 00:08:01,180
joystick button. Okay, so the reason why I did that is so I don't have to do that for like another

40
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:13,129
three years. I get asked to do that all the fucking time. So there's this this three years worth of

41
00:08:13,209 --> 00:08:19,990
me doing that like six or seven out of ten beatbox. Okay, there you go. All right,

42
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:22,949
when words appear here, press the enter key or a joystick button to get in here. Okay.

43
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:33,269
Oh, I'm kidding. I'm not gonna do it again. Please walk through a doorway to choose a level. How do

44
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:47,159
I walk through a doorway? Oh, no, no, no, no. This is a game for children, right? I mean,

45
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:57,460
I can do intermediate. He's doing the walk. If you guys know what I mean. Intermediate.

46
00:09:01,929 --> 00:09:18,580
Advanced. No. All right. You have to help me though. Okay, so I have to. I'm moving way faster

47
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:28,620
now. This controls like Snake, by the way. I can't control this. Toys. How long do you want to work

48
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:45,509
a two minute shift? Yeah, I want to work a one minute shift, please. Sure. Let's go. Use the

49
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:51,429
joystick or arrow keys to change the minutes below. Press the button to start work. I mean,

50
00:09:51,429 --> 00:10:16,889
press the button. Press the button? How? What button? Press it. I can't. Press the button.

51
00:10:16,889 --> 00:10:27,399
There is no button to press. Is the button? How do I walk? Press any key. Enter. I think I would

52
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:39,980
have a... I need to play this. Come on. W A S D. No. M. B. B for button. P. L. K. Space. Shift.

53
00:10:42,549 --> 00:10:57,779
Right. F. G. H. Z. It's not Z. Damn it, I have to play this. It's X! The Amquac Special will pass

54
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:12,149
in zero minutes. What? This is every single Super Nintendo RPG you've ever played. There's a

55
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:18,940
sequence where the character freaks out and runs around to collect stuff. And this is it. Oh, I got

56
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:32,120
it. Put it in the trash? Oh, what? What am I supposed to do? Am I just breaking shit? I'm breaking

57
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:58,679
stuff. Oh, guys, this is gonna be impossible. I need to go... What? Um, it's playing Pac-Man.

58
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:13,110
Only times five speed. I have to get it perfect. It's too many FPS. Anybody know how to... How do

59
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:31,529
I fix this? I think there's a way I can, right? Do I have to make my monitor, like, 30 hertz?

60
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:48,279
How much do... I have no money. Turn down the cycles. Right click, set FPS, custom jubated.

61
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:58,600
Fuck. Why? I have to lower the speed of the CPU. I know there's a way you can do it from inside here.

62
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:12,149
Somebody know the key? Go into the DOS box options. I know there's a way to do it. Somebody showed

63
00:13:12,149 --> 00:13:17,190
me this before, didn't they? All right, well, I'm just gonna wait till 37 seconds is up.

64
00:13:18,409 --> 00:13:32,539
F11? I'm just gonna wait till I fail. Somebody said, do you guys ever get tired of tormenting

65
00:13:32,539 --> 00:13:41,580
this man? What do you mean tormenting this man? So, wait, control F11. Is that gonna, like, open up

66
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:49,399
fucking Siri or something? Like, somebody... I need somebody to confirm this. That's not gonna open up,

67
00:13:49,399 --> 00:14:00,659
like, oh, it's me, Siri. Control F11 slows it down. It's the Siri hotkey. Time's up. Press a button

68
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:04,980
to leave. Okay, listen. You've earned nothing. For a second, I thought it was putting me in jail.

69
00:14:12,149 --> 00:14:18,629
Does that work? I need at least, like, a 95% in chat. People say it's control plus shift plus T

70
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:35,419
is time. Control F11? Did it work? It did. Right? Okay, yeah. Thank God for some of these fucking

71
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:52,649
super brains in chat. Five for ten dollars. Let's see what this does. You have zero dollars.

72
00:14:52,649 --> 00:15:04,659
Rocking horse. Who is that? Why am I shaking? Hey, hey, do you have any of those things I made for

73
00:15:04,659 --> 00:15:26,309
my nephews? Like, slow down. That's a tetherball? Donald, like, crack duck. All right, let's go to

74
00:15:26,309 --> 00:15:38,409
hardware store. Let me go to work. Do I have to work for Mickey? Hi, Mickey. Enter? No? I can't do

75
00:15:38,409 --> 00:15:56,809
a Donald Duck voice, so I'm not gonna try. You forgot this tutorial for a child's game.

76
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:04,139
No, no, I didn't. What I did is I was going, all right, I was going 5,000 miles per hour

77
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:25,059
in a child's game. There's a difference. Okay, how long do you, let's, here we go.

78
00:16:25,779 --> 00:16:30,899
I want to work for, I don't want to do that long. Let's do a one, a two minute shift.

79
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:39,350
All right, now, what do I have to do? Am I Donald Duck the air traffic controller?

80
00:16:41,419 --> 00:16:58,340
What am I doing? Okay, we got, what? What's the plan? What do I do? Put, this goes into,

81
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:12,539
what? Okay, this is luggage, I think. Okay, luggage. Is that going in? I'm just throwing

82
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:27,660
luggage out the window. Oh, Las Vegas! I want that one. No, no, give me that. I didn't catch it,

83
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:35,559
apparently. What airport is S? I'm hitting the button when it comes by, all right? I swear.

84
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:55,849
All right, there you go. I need it. Okay, I got it. I'm good. I really hope this is, no,

85
00:17:55,849 --> 00:18:05,769
I've only earned 36 cents. That's pretty unbelievable, actually. Well, I mean, for one

86
00:18:05,769 --> 00:18:27,339
minute of work, what does that turn out to be for an hour? I just let go of it. Okay, you can't let

87
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:37,640
go of the ass airport. I have to actually put it back down and then, okay, awardee, come on.

88
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:53,319
So, what, 81 cents? Atlanta. All right, time's up. 81 cents for a minute of work.

89
00:18:53,960 --> 00:19:10,789
That's a dollar a minute. That's a pretty good job. That's, that's $60 an hour. You earned,

90
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:26,039
did they take taxes out? No, you earned 81 cents. Okay, that's cool. So, now what do I want to buy?

91
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:29,720
I need to buy toys for the park. What about the deals? Let's go to the train station.

92
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:49,980
Donald Duck doesn't pay his taxes. No, we can't, you can't teach kids about taxes this early.

93
00:19:49,980 --> 00:20:01,619
How long do you want to work? Um, you have to do at least a three minute. No, one minute. This

94
00:20:01,619 --> 00:20:12,019
advanced railroad. So, I have to route cars? Pick up at Duck City. Which one is that? Duck City is,

95
00:20:12,019 --> 00:20:22,150
where's Duck City? Four? What? No, no, no, no. I have to, okay, hold on. I have to route it.

96
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:30,039
Where's it going? All right, pick up at Duck City. We need to route you from, no, go this way,

97
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:46,980
Donald. What are you doing? Okay, when I press left twice, he goes right. Oh, it's because he

98
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:56,500
goes, he just stops. He stops. No, he doesn't. Three. I need to turn him. No, he's about to go

99
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:06,599
to Duckburg. I desperately want to just turn at four. It needs to happen at four or five.

100
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:21,690
Well, I didn't, I didn't do anything. I have to at least buy one item before I move on.

101
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:29,369
What's this one? Zero dollars an hour. Well, that would be zero dollars in a minute.

102
00:21:30,009 --> 00:21:41,180
How long do you want to work? Uh, one, uh, two minutes. So, this is a catch the, I think I

103
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:48,549
figured it out. All right, I'm gonna make a ton of money on this one. Wait, why do they need me? He

104
00:21:48,549 --> 00:22:02,890
just threw it in there. Okay, hold on. You can clearly just make the throw. Why do I have to

105
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:14,970
be here to catch it? That guy could walk two or three feet to the left and make the throw. This is

106
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:22,710
so sloppy because I can't stop moving. When I hit right, he just keeps going all the way to the

107
00:22:22,710 --> 00:23:00,539
right. Donald Duck, you suck. I, oh my God. I can't do it, man. It's too, I know what's going on.

108
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:30,900
My CPU was on too slow. What the fuck happened? That just dropped off. I didn't catch that one

109
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:42,980
somehow. Oh my God, whatever. I don't care. You made what, 40 cents? That's actually a pound for

110
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:52,230
pound better than the other one. All right, what is that? I have a dollar 17. Can I get that? Can

111
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:58,150
I afford it? Let's, let's, every time I get out here, I want to go a little faster. I think I've

112
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:11,960
done all the jobs I can do. Uh, $10, $5 and $10. What about junk? Do the nephews care that much?

113
00:24:17,299 --> 00:24:28,869
Old box. Slide for fort. Tire swing. It's 71 cents for the tire swing. Okay, hold on.

114
00:24:30,009 --> 00:24:39,190
Rope and pulley. Ladder to tree house. All right, well, let's get the old box. Let's get him a

115
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:46,140
cardboard box. Hello, says Goofy. Walk to the item you want. Press the button to take it.

116
00:24:46,140 --> 00:25:09,509
Pay me for it over here. All right, you have to pay. Where am I? Uh, just kidding, Goofy. Don't

117
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:26,019
worry. All right, I want the tire swing and I want the cardboard box. Okay, please pay for your

118
00:25:26,019 --> 00:25:36,789
purchases now. Yeah, please pay for your purchases. Now you owe $1.9. You have a dollar. All right,

119
00:25:36,789 --> 00:25:50,299
$1. I told you that it's playing snake. I can't stop this. Okay, 20. When you are done, move

120
00:25:51,180 --> 00:26:12,279
the arrow to the register T total key and press the button. Okay, 50 cents, 75 cents,

121
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:31,609
there, 85 cents, 95 cents. Do I have enough? I don't have enough. No, I do. There's a dollar

122
00:26:31,609 --> 00:26:48,299
right here. Dollar five. Do I get change? Goofy will give me change, right? All right, that's it.

123
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:54,839
Give me change, Goofy. Thank you. Please make change. Why don't, wait, did I just, do I have

124
00:26:54,839 --> 00:27:03,349
to walk behind the counter and make the change? Goofy, what the hell do you do here? It's $20.

125
00:27:03,349 --> 00:27:13,940
$20. I don't know anything about math, Donald. That's okay, Goofy. I'll take care of you.

126
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:41,420
No, I don't want to give it back. Oh, God. Okay, press button to leave. Goofy's just fucking

127
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:57,369
really dumb. This is just paper, Goofy. The coins are the real valuable ones. Well, that makes sense.

128
00:27:57,849 --> 00:28:17,130
I'm not done with this one. I write on paper every day. Not every day that I see silver. All

129
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:29,859
right, I'm going to do this one. Move faster, Donald. Fuck. All right, I'll do two minutes.

130
00:28:29,859 --> 00:28:34,700
Now that I have, I can actually do it. All right, slow down though. This is still too fast. All

131
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:42,039
right, give me, no, no, no, no, give me this. Have I figured out what the hell's going on here?

132
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:49,940
Do I have to put this up here? Actually, I don't know what I'm doing. I have no idea what I'm

133
00:28:49,940 --> 00:29:03,400
doing. Do I have to get, I think I have to get this from the top shelf? I have to push the ladder.

134
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:42,740
How do I push the ladder? Oh, my God. Oh, no, catch it. I don't know. I don't understand this part.

135
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:54,170
Is this, this is once broken. It just is. Okay, I can't fix this one. This, there's no, there's not

136
00:29:54,170 --> 00:30:01,990
like a, what's the Freddy pizza game? This is not, what the hell is it called? Five Nights at Freddy's.

137
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:10,710
We're like, oh, something crazy is gonna happen and Donald Duck's gonna murder somebody. That's

138
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:48,259
actually, the game is broken. All right, how do I just skip work? I, I like this Donald Duck though.

139
00:30:48,980 --> 00:31:02,200
This doesn't look as really cute. Don't you think? All right, let's go. You're nothing. I have six

140
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:27,779
cents. When does this game end? Can I leave this area, this part of town? That's went in the well?

141
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:35,190
No. Oh, the park. This is the park. Okay, let's go. Can I like piss on the hydrant?

142
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:50,329
Duckburg, the city park. Like, can I get on the train? Wait, oh, I looked both ways before

143
00:31:50,329 --> 00:32:04,710
crossing the street. Donald Duck is really like fucking playing with his life here. All right,

144
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:20,220
let's go. Is this still Donald Duck? No, this is Huey. Do I have to bring the items with me?

145
00:32:25,859 --> 00:32:46,339
Are these Mickey's gallows? Can I just walk the, all the way? Is there anything over here?

146
00:32:48,009 --> 00:32:56,809
No, I have to go. That's like the boy's little hut or something, right? Can you get hit by the

147
00:32:56,809 --> 00:33:03,769
train? I'm going to say 100%. No, I don't think they would code in Donald Duck getting hit by a

148
00:33:03,769 --> 00:33:11,049
fucking train. In, all right, I'm gonna do the airport one again. Now I got money on this one.

149
00:33:11,049 --> 00:33:21,700
I'm gonna get some more money. All right, I'm gonna do two minutes of this and then,

150
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:26,519
I know you guys want me to move on, but I can't. This is gonna be really very fast. Hold on, slow

151
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:41,420
it down. Okay, I'll get, I'm gonna do this quick. No, no, get it. BMG, BTR, JFK, and TVL.

152
00:33:45,339 --> 00:33:48,460
Let me make it, let me just at least get one more like cool item for the, for the kids,

153
00:33:48,460 --> 00:34:15,800
you know what I mean? What? Oh fuck, come on. BTR, JFK, BMG. You idiot. How much more time do I have?

154
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:22,630
I have a lot of time. I gotta get five bucks to buy something cool in like Mickey's store.

155
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:36,219
Where's the mini store? I don't know who's in there. BTR. I have a new strategy. It's called

156
00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:56,150
do the minimum amount of work. What? Well, it's BTL. No, I'm gonna stick with the original strategy.

157
00:34:56,150 --> 00:35:26,070
BTR. That's close enough. Dollar 35? I should have just stayed in BTR. Come on. Like three of them

158
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:33,369
just went by. Four of them went by. Where are, come on, where are they? They had no more? Maybe,

159
00:35:33,369 --> 00:35:39,769
maybe the game knows I'm trying to do that. Oh, whatever. Dollar 62. He's still playing this. I

160
00:35:39,769 --> 00:35:47,110
know. Sometimes when you find one you have to stick with it to see what happens. We got paper money

161
00:35:47,110 --> 00:36:04,570
now. I'm gonna do, what's another easy one? The train one is too all over the place for me.

162
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:14,659
This one. I'll get this one. The farm one. It's been on this game for a half an hour.

163
00:36:17,179 --> 00:36:35,800
No, I haven't. It has not been a half an hour. Has it? Yeah, it actually has been half an hour.

164
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:44,659
Oh man. Um, it's all right. It's all right. Let me just, let me just put one object in. Let me just

165
00:36:44,659 --> 00:36:59,369
go to my house. What? Why did I drop that? No, this one sucks. Okay, can I afford anything for two

166
00:36:59,369 --> 00:37:09,780
dollars? No, this is not enough money. I'm doing it really well right now. It doesn't matter.

167
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:21,050
That's it. How did that not go in the tomato bucket? Oh my god. 33 cents. All right, I'm gonna buy

168
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:39,300
something. Look, it's teaching kids how to count money with their hands. All right, here we go.

169
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:46,760
I'm gonna go buy a cool toy and then I'll be done. And we can move on to the next one that I have

170
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:55,130
here. Donald Duck can barely make ends meet, yet he spends his last change on his children's gifts

171
00:37:55,130 --> 00:38:11,340
for Christmas. Donald can go hungry tonight for his children's joy in their faces. What the fuck?

172
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:19,050
That's fucked up. All right, what do we got? All right, I can do the, uh, tether ball is a dollar

173
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:32,650
ninety-nine. Rocking horse is, okay, let's get the rocking horse. Please pay for your money. All

174
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:44,059
right, I don't want, I want to keep the dollar. Put it on the counter. When you are done, move,

175
00:38:44,059 --> 00:39:02,860
yeah, to the, to the t. Yeah, I know. 57 cents. Press done now. Um, what do you mean press done

176
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:13,110
now? It's gonna tell me I'm wrong. Sorry, no sale. Yeah, there's no, like, bartering system.

177
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:27,380
All right, that's 55.57. One more penny. Your purchase will be delivered. Well, delivered where?

178
00:39:28,019 --> 00:39:40,570
How do I just go back to my house? Where is it being delivered to? To the park? All right,

179
00:39:40,570 --> 00:40:02,809
if it's not at the park, then I'm moving on. Please, this game is killing me. I like this one.

180
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:26,389
Where is my stuff? They're not actually sending it to me. Wait, oh shit. Found it. And you guys

181
00:40:26,389 --> 00:40:42,170
didn't want to see. I can play with all the toys as Huey. Tire swing. Nice. Really, really nice.

182
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:56,789
All right, what else is there? Where's my box? Do you see the cardboard box? That was kind of cute

183
00:40:56,789 --> 00:41:09,289
for 30 seconds. Yeah, we had to get a payoff, even if it took 40 minutes. So what is supposed

184
00:41:09,289 --> 00:41:25,190
to go up there? Keep playing this so chat can suffer. Um, a little confused by, uh, so Donald

185
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:34,150
Duck somehow can't afford to buy cardboard boxes and has to work for a dollar, but has a Elon Musk

186
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:44,860
space shuttle in his backyard. Well, we know how he lost all of his money. Why is this a slide?

187
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:56,550
Hold on. This is important. Is this a like a water slide? That's a themed water slide.

188
00:42:06,139 --> 00:42:18,739
That's my favorite. Jump on and jump off. That's all you need. This can be so many things. I want

189
00:42:18,739 --> 00:42:31,500
to go to the slide. Can I go to the other side? No, that's it. It's just a rocket back here. Get

190
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:45,219
the ladder. Hold on. Do I have to get the ladder? How much is the ladder? Speed up time? I think it

191
00:42:45,219 --> 00:42:55,860
says maximum speed. Yeah, this is at max speed, guys. All right, let me just get the ladder and

192
00:42:55,860 --> 00:43:02,949
let me go up. I want to do the slide. This will be quick. Where's the ladder? Hardware. How much is

193
00:43:02,949 --> 00:43:19,059
it? No, it's not. Where is it? Uh, ship's wheel. Hand walking rope. Nope. Where is it? There it is.

194
00:43:19,059 --> 00:43:33,670
$2.95. What do I have? $1.46. I got it. I'll do this really fast. We're gonna do uh just uh this

195
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:39,099
one airport one. It's really fast speed. I make a dollar. I'm done. Just hold on. Wait one minute.

196
00:43:39,099 --> 00:43:50,440
Go. I just want to see if we can get up on the top of the slide because this is going too fast.

197
00:43:51,000 --> 00:44:11,900
All right, I need uh I need lip. BTL. Come on. Oh, come on. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Stop,

198
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:29,079
stop, stop, stop. Really? I need a dollar. I need one dollar. Pick it up. Oh god. No, that's BTR.

199
00:44:29,639 --> 00:44:51,610
I need SFD. It's, it's on too fast. How much do I have? 171, 181, 199. How much is the ladder?

200
00:44:51,610 --> 00:45:00,219
Two something, right? I'll do it again. I need to see what the ladder does. Like this is the only,

201
00:45:00,219 --> 00:45:06,920
I will never have this opportunity again my entire life. Nobody will, you'll never see this again,

202
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:26,460
ever. Don't you need to know? I need like 50 cents, 60 cents. I need to know. Oh my god,

203
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:36,409
why can I not pick anything up? BTL, PSP. I just, it's hard. I can't even read them.

204
00:45:49,300 --> 00:46:04,469
Come on, one more. Oh my god. BTL. All right, I got it. I got enough. I'm gonna have exact change.

205
00:46:04,469 --> 00:46:32,900
No, not. All right, I'm good. Let's go. It was 240 something, wasn't it? Speed it up. Don't get the

206
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:45,750
ladder. Get the catwalk. I, for real? Catwalk, catwalk to rocket slide. Oh, fuck, it's 299.

207
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:59,110
Do I need both? I need both. All right, I'll do this quick. That, this is the one that makes the

208
00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:03,030
most money. I have to do this like a few times. How many times do I have to do this? Get a loan.

209
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:12,010
That's not how this works. Um, no, I gotta do, I have to do this one. I have to. Just, I'm gonna do,

210
00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:16,489
okay. I'm gonna do this for five minutes. No, I'm not. That's way too long. Three minutes. It's

211
00:47:16,489 --> 00:47:26,579
four minutes. All right, this is the last time you're ever gonna see this. Okay, slow it down,

212
00:47:26,579 --> 00:47:33,460
slow it down. I got, I got four minutes of the worst content you will ever see on the stream

213
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:39,849
is this game. But it's okay because, no, actually, never mind. I take that back. This is the best.

214
00:47:47,449 --> 00:47:56,940
I just need like three bucks. HML. No, no, no. PSP, HML, lax, ATL. How did I miss that?

215
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:02,980
Okay, double, triple, come on. Oh my god, I'm throwing in the wrong one. What an idiot.

216
00:48:03,539 --> 00:48:27,239
I just need to see what it does. PSP, lax. I'm gonna stay back here. They're easy. Okay, I'm gonna,

217
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:38,789
you have to stay all the way to the right so I can see them. That's a dollar. What do I even

218
00:48:38,789 --> 00:49:03,179
have in my hands? Okay, lax. Atlanta. Uh, Atlanta. Shit. Two hours on this, two hours on this Donald

219
00:49:03,179 --> 00:49:15,579
fuck garbage. It's been, it's been an hour, but it's been 50 minutes. Just hold on. Just hold on.

220
00:49:15,579 --> 00:49:37,289
Don't worry. It'll, it'll be worth it. What is PSP? What airport is PSP? Pennsylvania?

221
00:49:39,019 --> 00:49:51,320
Philadelphia? PlayStation Portable. Yeah, I know. I understand that that's the joke, but what is it

222
00:49:51,320 --> 00:50:06,139
actually? I definitely have enough for both now. What's going on? I still have a minute and 25

223
00:50:06,139 --> 00:50:18,760
seconds left in my shift. Oh, he's coming back. Okay, he's wrapping around. PSP, please stop playing.

224
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:27,639
Nope, I'm not gonna. Oh, there's only one more.

225
00:50:37,219 --> 00:50:43,739
You guys, you guys, come on. Let me have, I mean, you gotta let me have some, some time.

226
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:51,539
I want to see what the slide looks like in the Donald Duck game. Give me a break. Just because

227
00:50:51,539 --> 00:50:57,619
I want to sit here and see what it does. And look, every, all, all the people that have been talking

228
00:50:57,619 --> 00:51:04,090
shit right now. We'll see. We'll see when you see the slide. I guarantee you half the people that

229
00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:08,730
are like, oh, no, no, get out of here. I'm going to be like, oh, pub champ. When I slide down that

230
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:28,389
fucking thing. Oh, I have to work, right? Worth, totally worth. I'm going to see worth, read out,

231
00:51:28,389 --> 00:51:44,900
just spam like a thousand times. All right. I need, uh, I need hue. I definitely have enough,

232
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:56,150
I think. Two seconds. All right. 297. I got three bills now. It's 240 for the

233
00:51:57,110 --> 00:51:59,500
all right. I definitely have enough. I got five bucks at least.

234
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:11,699
Oh, it's do, it's counting the coins up and giving me new denominations.

235
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:24,760
All right. I got $5 and 60 cents. I'm ready. And look, everybody else doesn't understand.

236
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:29,559
I get to be in the Guinness book of world records for an incredibly specific thing.

237
00:52:32,809 --> 00:52:36,809
I streamed this for an hour. No one else on earth has ever done that.

238
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:48,199
Ever. I get to be in that book. You know, I, I, you know, I'll probably list it in that book,

239
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:55,909
like a hundred times. You have $5 catwalk to the rocket slide. Yes. And then the ladder, right?

240
00:52:58,039 --> 00:53:09,699
Hand walking rope, ship's wheel, trampoline, summer salt bar. Okay. So then I do this and

241
00:53:09,699 --> 00:53:19,530
get the ladder. Please pay. All right. Just take it. Just take my money already. I got like

242
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:23,289
3,400 people here that are just screaming at me to hurry this up. All right. Let's do,

243
00:53:24,730 --> 00:53:44,099
I'm getting three bucks and give me back one penny. No, uh, please make change. Yes.

244
00:53:46,519 --> 00:54:06,010
Why is this going so slow? Done. All right. Now we do the ladder. Okay. Let me just make sure.

245
00:54:06,570 --> 00:54:09,349
Rings ladder to rocket ship.

246
00:54:09,349 --> 00:54:33,400
Okay. I have to, I just bought the scaffolding. I can't not do this. It's been too long. One minute.

247
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:41,320
Go. I just need to throw three packages. Just wait, just hold on. Just bear with me. I just

248
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:58,389
need to do, I'm just going to stand here and do JFK only. How many, how many, what do I need?

249
00:54:58,389 --> 00:55:13,539
It's 2.99, right? I have enough now. JFK, come on. JFK, come on. All right. It's not showing me JFK.

250
00:55:13,539 --> 00:55:30,789
Throw like an Oak Oak and JFK only. I got enough, right? Yeah. No, I have to. Yeah. I definitely

251
00:55:30,789 --> 00:55:38,389
have enough. 100%. I'm just going to go in there and just dump all my change on the counter and

252
00:55:38,389 --> 00:55:56,789
just leave. I don't even care about making change. Oh, it's going to do another dollar. If the rocket,

253
00:55:56,789 --> 00:56:05,000
if the rocket lifts off and takes off as like a funny cartoon joke, you owe me an apology.

254
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:19,380
If I just slide down the slide and that's it, I owe you an apology. We're both in on this.

255
00:56:29,829 --> 00:56:40,699
Ladder to the rocket ship, 2.95. Let's go. Please pay for your purchases. Give me the dollar.

256
00:56:41,579 --> 00:56:49,139
Is the dollar, is it implying it's very heavy? Because look at my hand.

257
00:56:50,019 --> 00:56:54,340
Oh, I got a frog in my throat. All right. That's, I need to 2.95. Dollar,

258
00:56:56,300 --> 00:57:13,289
125, 150, 175, $2. Okay. 2.25, 250. I'm a fucking old lady paying for an ice cream.

259
00:57:15,239 --> 00:57:31,110
2.75. Okay. 2.80. 2.90. I'm just sitting there behind her just going like, get a fucking credit

260
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:39,699
card. It's not hard. It's very easy. All right. What was it? What? I forgot. 2.95. What am I at?

261
00:57:45,960 --> 00:58:09,769
You startled me. I don't know. Where? How much is up there? Let's go. I like to pay with exact

262
00:58:09,769 --> 00:58:16,570
change so the government can't track me. I don't think the government gives a shit that you find a

263
00:58:16,570 --> 00:58:37,539
large ice cream from Ben and Jerry's. All right. Come on. Buy the boom box. Here we go. This is it.

264
00:58:38,889 --> 00:58:45,989
Oh, this is going to be awesome. I can't wait. That's straw man propaganda.

265
00:58:47,110 --> 00:58:56,170
I'm going in. Let's go. It's going to take off. Do it. Take off. This is huge. All right. This

266
00:58:56,170 --> 00:59:02,710
counts. You thought I was just going to be that top screen. This counts. Oh my God. Why is there

267
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:14,940
like a 200 foot? No, no, no, no, no, no. Go back. I wouldn't do this. This is scary. All right. You

268
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:27,110
owe me an apology. You owe me an apology. All right. Are you kidding me? He just did a double

269
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:46,679
front flip. You owe me an apology. I'm doing it again. The one resident sleeper in there is like

270
00:59:46,679 --> 00:59:55,539
probably my favorite. I would puke if I was up here. This is not safe. These are children.

271
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:04,519
Double front flip. You don't get an apology from me. That's better than the ship taking off.

272
01:00:13,579 --> 01:00:26,579
Okay. Lame. Lame. So bald. I'm not going to read that. All right. Let me ask you a question.

273
01:00:27,610 --> 01:00:32,760
If I kept this and turn the volume up all the way and muted my microphone and left the room

274
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:50,980
and zoomed in on the box, would the viewers go up or down? Okay. Uh, this next one, I remember

275
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:54,019
playing this a long time ago. I don't remember anything about it, but I remember it being a

276
01:00:54,019 --> 01:01:10,099
thing. Um, shuffle puck cafe. I'm not going to do that. Apologize now. I'm sorry that you feel

277
01:01:10,099 --> 01:01:21,900
that way. So shuffle puck cafe is a, you fight against other people playing shuffle puck. Of

278
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:29,750
course you do. Anyways, uh, I don't know if I want to select my video card game. Is it mouse?

279
01:01:30,469 --> 01:01:39,449
This game is weird. You know, um, what's that Christopher Robin game where you have to hit

280
01:01:39,449 --> 01:01:46,679
the baseball and hit a home run Winnie the Pooh, Christopher Robin baseball, whatever it's called,

281
01:01:46,679 --> 01:01:56,789
the whole, like whatever it is, it's kind of like that. They progressively just get insanely

282
01:01:56,789 --> 01:02:25,400
difficult. Okay. Here we go. So, uh, you pick an opponent. Let's pick the pig. This is not,

283
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:34,519
this is not a porn game. What are you talking about? Oh my God. That was, is it turned up or

284
01:02:34,519 --> 01:02:38,599
did I, does it turn down? I think I might've turned it up too high. Should I turn it down?

285
01:02:48,019 --> 01:02:58,500
It's air hockey. Yeah. Why did I not say air hockey? It's a game where you, you

286
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:07,800
shuffle puck again. It's air hockey. As you can tell, it's pretty hard. It's especially,

287
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:15,289
it's running at like, my game is running at like 20 frames a second. His game is running at like

288
01:03:15,289 --> 01:03:20,579
60 frames a second. It's not fair. This is what happens when a PC player plays a console player.

289
01:03:20,579 --> 01:03:38,659
This is why you can't, the cross-platform don't work. All right. Hold on. I'm going to try

290
01:03:38,659 --> 01:03:41,539
something, a tactic here. I'm going to try to go into the top right corner every time.

291
01:03:46,539 --> 01:03:48,539
No. Oh my God. Look, he's lining up a shot.

292
01:03:48,539 --> 01:04:05,940
It's not as easy as it looks. It's look, look at the frames. Come on. Like give me a break.

293
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:15,099
It's not frame perfect. Like you think it is. Go back to, no, this is not one of the hard ones.

294
01:04:15,099 --> 01:04:25,300
Hold on. I'm just going to, I think, I think the pig is hard. How many points does it take

295
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:43,420
for me to get embarrassed? I wonder. Okay. Hold on. Oh, I'm using that technique. If I have like

296
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:59,909
10 frames a second, then I can fill the whole board with a giant paddle. Why are we playing

297
01:04:59,909 --> 01:05:23,239
to 15? We shouldn't be playing to 15. That's what makes no sense. I know it's just let it fall in.

298
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:27,559
Just do it. Just get it. Do it. Do it. I'm going to play the easy one.

299
01:05:28,119 --> 01:05:36,679
And this game was so much fun though. It read at so much better frame rate in my brain.

300
01:05:36,679 --> 01:05:53,780
When I played it, I played this on an original Mac. All right. I lost. Game. Wait. Define keys.

301
01:05:53,780 --> 01:06:27,059
Champions. Biff raunch is 15 and 14. Okay. Paddle. No, I can't lose. Somebody said, okay.

302
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:40,260
I don't think this is regulation. He's got a chalkboard eraser and I have an entire lane

303
01:06:40,820 --> 01:07:06,500
of bowling bumpers. See, he's easy though. Look at this. Watch how slow. I'm just going to show

304
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:12,389
you. Watch how slow he does this. See that the pig was hard. It was a hard one. All right. I'm

305
01:07:12,389 --> 01:07:16,329
going to, I can drop the, all right. I'm going to, I'm going to put it down to a smaller. Look at

306
01:07:16,329 --> 01:07:25,619
that. That's so much easier. I hold on. How do I, can I like, there we go. All right. Paddle size.

307
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:36,780
Let's put it back to normal. It was a 20. All right. I will beat you. Locker, no blocker,

308
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:44,329
small blocker, custom blocker, whatever that means. All right. Here we go. All right. Let's go. Yeah.

309
01:07:44,329 --> 01:07:50,380
He's absolutely stupid. Like I will win no matter what. I have to give myself a,

310
01:07:51,860 --> 01:08:01,099
no. Look at, see, I went right to the hardest thing in the game. That was my problem. Make it

311
01:08:01,099 --> 01:08:18,359
one or you're a fake gamer. I don't think you can even do that. I'm going to win. This is embarrassing.

312
01:08:22,539 --> 01:08:38,060
No, new opponent. This is just, this is, this is a hustle. No, it's not. Chalk eraser versus a piece

313
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:49,460
of chalk. I wonder if I do it really hard. If it'll break through his hologram shield. Do it.

314
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:59,609
You're going to make them cry. No, new opponent. This is like, this is embarrassing for you. I

315
01:08:59,609 --> 01:09:06,920
don't want to just have you lose by this much. Let's do, let's go back to 20 and new opponent.

316
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:10,920
I know there's a, I think the robot is the hardest thing in the whole game.

317
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:27,590
I think the robot's actually impossible. So let's see. Why was the pig so hard? The robot is always

318
01:09:27,590 --> 01:09:38,409
the hardest one. This guy's the champion. Did I do something? Did I change a setting? Why was the

319
01:09:38,409 --> 01:09:46,250
pig so unbearable? But the robot's not. I swear I have this memory of it being like around the edges.

320
01:09:46,810 --> 01:10:01,939
I must have fucked something up. You just sucked when you last played. No, no way.

321
01:10:01,939 --> 01:10:14,220
No way. New opponent. Look, here he is. I didn't just suck when I last played. I'm sorry guys.

322
01:10:14,220 --> 01:10:29,979
That's not the case. His cursor is actually teleporting. See if I can beat him though. I'll

323
01:10:29,979 --> 01:11:00,920
try. Jesus. Ooh, it's going to be close. I'll do it. I can do it. Boomer versus a zoomer.

324
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:09,140
I'm an idiot. Why does everybody have to be a boomer and everybody have to be a zoomer?

325
01:11:14,329 --> 01:11:28,699
And I don't even know which one is who in that scenario. Why is it always going to be about

326
01:11:28,699 --> 01:11:46,939
boomer? Seriously, don't ask me how actual 12 year old me was able to do this. Nice. All right,

327
01:11:46,939 --> 01:11:59,270
I got the advantage. This is the champion, right? It's because you probably used a bigger paddle.

328
01:11:59,270 --> 01:12:24,949
You know, I probably did. I'm trying to sneak it into the corner. I'm still in game. All right,

329
01:12:24,949 --> 01:12:32,810
I'm going to wait till his cursor is on the left and then go. I'm trying to do a tennis strategy.

330
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:51,109
It's not really working. He doesn't know about the second form. They don't evolve. Hey, I say

331
01:12:51,109 --> 01:12:55,029
that's what happens when I look over a chat. If I was in a tournament and we were about to start,

332
01:12:55,029 --> 01:13:00,069
I wouldn't look over at the audience and go, what did somebody just say? No, I would play. Let's go.

333
01:13:05,420 --> 01:13:10,779
No professional athlete in the world like a baseball player doesn't get up to the batter's

334
01:13:10,779 --> 01:13:15,020
box with the bat in his hand, step into the plate and right before the pitcher starts to pitch

335
01:13:15,739 --> 01:13:19,979
turns around and like asks a question to the fucking people in the stands behind him.

336
01:13:19,979 --> 01:13:56,279
No, he just focuses and he plays the damn game. I was imagining a baseball player is standing

337
01:13:56,279 --> 01:14:02,789
in the batter's box and he's responding to somebody that's behind him calling him bald.

338
01:14:02,789 --> 01:14:16,569
Or this looks like looks like Jay Albertson at the plate here seems to be arguing with somebody

339
01:14:16,569 --> 01:14:22,649
behind home plate, the home plate baseball. That was a ball, but it looks like they're screaming.

340
01:14:22,649 --> 01:14:26,890
He's pointing at his head saying it's I'm not. I'm not. I'm not sure what he's talking about here,

341
01:14:26,890 --> 01:14:31,260
Frank. What does that mean? No, he took the helmet off. He took the helmet off. He's pointing his

342
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:39,500
hair. He's getting loud now. He's been ejected from the game. This is the only fucking platform

343
01:14:39,500 --> 01:15:00,260
where this happens. All right. I got, I got some more. What about a comedy show? Yeah, but

344
01:15:01,399 --> 01:15:08,789
you're not like a professional comedy athlete. A comedian doesn't go on stage and open up shuffle

345
01:15:08,789 --> 01:15:36,279
puck and play it with his back to the audience. All right. I can still do it. Come on. Three more.

346
01:15:36,279 --> 01:15:50,460
Well, why wouldn't you? I don't know. I'm not supposed to be looking over here. All right.

347
01:15:50,460 --> 01:16:20,569
Tied it up. Two more and I beat this guy. One more. Here we go. Oh,

348
01:16:20,569 --> 01:16:37,939
no. Give me the ball. Give me the puck. Give me the puck. You lose. Hey, take those shoulders

349
01:16:37,939 --> 01:17:02,359
back to Alderman. You fucking idiot. Who's next? I think this is the hard one. This guy's only

350
01:17:02,359 --> 01:17:22,649
playing with one hand. He's like drinking. So am I, but I'm drinking coffee. That's the difference.

351
01:17:22,649 --> 01:17:45,020
You can do it. Who plays air hockey with two hands? Oh yeah. It's not a Ouija board.

352
01:17:51,670 --> 01:18:06,409
So who's the hardest person in here? It's definitely not you. You don't have enough power.

353
01:18:06,409 --> 01:18:11,770
All right. That was, I had insane amount of spin on that. Look at this. He's all defense. He has

354
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:32,840
no offense. I'm just gonna walk away from the table. What about who's under here? Oh, he put

355
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:54,550
his hand up. Yeah, you're real bad. Not even up to a challenge. It's not even worth, it's not worth

356
01:18:54,550 --> 01:19:02,920
my time. It's not. I'm sorry. Hey, thanks for playing. I'm way, way higher on like the tier list

357
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:07,899
than you, but I could make you feel happy. You want me to make you like feel better?

358
01:19:07,899 --> 01:19:37,000
Oops. Okay. There you go. You got a point. Good work. You, yeah. Do not Disney movie me. I'm not

359
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:59,100
gonna let that happen. I'm out. Here we go. Is her paddle smaller? Why does she have a smaller paddle?

360
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:27,739
The hell was that? Uh, so that's cheating. So you, that you cheated. I don't get to do that.

361
01:20:27,739 --> 01:20:43,699
Okay. That's an automatic disqualification. Ah, the role play gets harder when you beat him enough.

362
01:20:43,699 --> 01:20:57,829
I know this one character in this game that you have magic powers. That's really cool. Actually,

363
01:20:57,829 --> 01:21:06,630
that's really cool. Who's anybody in the back? What about, what was that? What was this little guy?

364
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:23,750
Is this the guy? Is the little Yoda guy? That's impossible. This is me. This is me. I did the

365
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:53,239
same thing. This is me. That's weird. I did this like fucking 25 minutes ago. Same tactic. I can't

366
01:21:53,239 --> 01:22:14,260
fucking believe it. And he's going to lose with one point. That's unbelievable. All right. Who's

367
01:22:14,260 --> 01:22:27,750
the last character? Who's this? Uh, looks like a beer. All right. Well, I didn't know you're

368
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:41,479
going to do that. Sorry. I beat the hardest. I beat the one up. I beat the champion. Maybe not.

369
01:22:41,479 --> 01:23:17,989
He does this little wind up. Oh man. Is it bad? Uh, is this Biff? I got to score at least one

370
01:23:17,989 --> 01:23:30,250
point on Biff right in the corner. I might, I might be able to do it. It's, it's really possible.

371
01:23:30,250 --> 01:24:28,069
That was so fast. You can't even see it. Ah, shit. That technique doesn't work. Stop doing it. Oh,

372
01:24:28,069 --> 01:24:36,630
I'm going to lose. I'm just realizing that this, yeah, there's not very much safety here.

373
01:24:36,630 --> 01:24:45,050
Imagine playing, um, air hockey with somebody without the barrier in front of you. You would

374
01:24:45,050 --> 01:24:53,050
get so hurt. I actually broke my finger before playing air hockey when I was younger. I had those

375
01:24:53,130 --> 01:24:56,170
friends and you know, some of you guys have them because when you play air hockey,

376
01:24:56,170 --> 01:25:00,329
there's this unwritten agreement that you're not going to fucking murder each other.

377
01:25:01,130 --> 01:25:06,090
Nobody wants to go as hard as they can. Crack, crack, crack. You have an unwritten rule that

378
01:25:06,090 --> 01:25:09,850
you're just going to play and no one's going to really go as hard as they can. See, my friends

379
01:25:09,850 --> 01:25:14,409
didn't do that. Friends of mine would try to go as hard as they can. And what would end up happening

380
01:25:14,409 --> 01:25:21,289
is it would hit the sides and bounce up and it was not cool. And sometimes they would do it too

381
01:25:21,289 --> 01:25:27,289
hard and it would hit the sides, bounce up and like, like kind of like go by. And you'd be like,

382
01:25:27,289 --> 01:25:34,680
stop that bullshit. Let's stop that. Well, one of those times it bounced up, caught me right in the

383
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:42,569
finger. And then we all got grounded. I, why did I get grounded? I have nothing to do with it.

384
01:25:53,859 --> 01:26:04,659
Fuck. He's going to embarrass me. Did this happen last week? No, it happened when I was like 14.

385
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:15,319
They need to make these things out of like a squishy material nowadays. Do they still make

386
01:26:15,319 --> 01:26:24,229
these things in a hard plastic? You know, many times I've been in an arcade and you just hear

387
01:26:26,470 --> 01:26:32,460
you look behind you and that thing is on its edge rolling down. It's like easy guys.

388
01:26:33,180 --> 01:26:50,329
Oh, you should have to wear like a big heavy glove. Yeah. Before you play this game,

389
01:26:50,329 --> 01:26:54,939
you should have to put on, it will not activate unless you put on this big, heavy fucking gauntlet

390
01:26:54,939 --> 01:27:03,659
that's like like 20 pounds. So you can't do it hard. I think I saw all the opponents, right?

391
01:27:07,210 --> 01:27:19,270
Yeah. This is the guy's the hardest. So I think we saw everybody. Unless there's somebody down here.

392
01:27:20,659 --> 01:27:28,760
No, this is just Martini guy. Play the robot. You want us to beat the robot badly and see what he

393
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:38,409
does? Robot, robot. All right. I'll beat the robot and then look, he's, he's very easy.

394
01:27:46,010 --> 01:27:56,890
There's a droid setting. Anybody else do this when you play air hockey with somebody?

395
01:27:59,060 --> 01:28:02,100
I don't like air hockey. I don't because it's a lot of money.

396
01:28:02,659 --> 01:28:09,539
Usually it's like a $1.50. It's usually one to $2 to play it. And usually the other person is

397
01:28:09,539 --> 01:28:14,500
way more excited to play than you are. And you have to deal with instead of Oh, I really want

398
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:18,819
to go play time crisis. That sounds like a lot of fun. Now you have to block out the next like

399
01:28:18,819 --> 01:28:25,930
30 straight minutes to pretend to enjoy playing air hockey. You can't leave the table. It's to

400
01:28:25,930 --> 01:28:30,649
say somebody Oh, you know, you scored one and I scored one. And then Oh, you missed. Oh, wait,

401
01:28:30,649 --> 01:28:36,090
this is nice. Nice like volley we've got going here. It lasts for like 20 to 30 minutes.

402
01:28:38,250 --> 01:28:43,609
And the table keeps producing air out of the holes until somebody wins. So you can't just leave.

403
01:28:45,689 --> 01:28:52,010
Nobody wants to take over your game for you because they want to do their own. But usually

404
01:28:52,010 --> 01:28:57,930
this one just dominant person. That's the one that they want to play there that you're that I want

405
01:28:57,930 --> 01:29:05,590
to let's do air hockey. Yeah. You just don't give a shit. Now I've been the air hockey enthusiast

406
01:29:05,590 --> 01:29:22,409
before. But there's never really a time when both people are incredibly enthusiastic about it.

407
01:29:22,409 --> 01:29:27,210
Sometimes it's even both are very not enthusiastic about it. You walk around the arcade four times.

408
01:29:28,460 --> 01:29:36,140
Oh, you even play air hockey, I guess. And then you both lazily play it. And neither one of you

409
01:29:36,140 --> 01:30:07,590
has any fun. I have fun. Maybe you shouldn't go to the arcade. We had an air air hockey table when I

410
01:30:07,590 --> 01:30:12,619
was kid, but friends of mine did the exact thing you're describing. And I didn't I was afraid to

411
01:30:12,619 --> 01:30:24,420
play it because I didn't want to break my finger. Yeah. And something else too. I'll tell you another

412
01:30:24,420 --> 01:30:31,819
thing. I don't I don't like the loud noises it makes. Is that am I weird? Anytime somebody gets

413
01:30:31,819 --> 01:30:37,659
like into back, back, back, back, back. It's like it's I don't like it. It's really fucking loud.

414
01:30:37,659 --> 01:30:43,960
It's like freaking me out. When you see your friend like queue up for like a big hit and you're like,

415
01:30:43,960 --> 01:30:50,789
don't do it, please don't do it, please. And they go, boom. It's like, oh, I don't want that. All

416
01:30:50,789 --> 01:31:08,380
right. So we'll just do it again. Droid. Oh, oh, no, I'm turning. I'm turning him into that friend.

417
01:31:19,779 --> 01:31:36,760
This is gonna crash my computer. Speed. I'm gonna break my finger. All right, serve.

418
01:31:38,300 --> 01:32:00,069
I'm gonna sneeze it. I'm really sorry. I'm fine. Okay, let's go. Okay. Have I did I make it

419
01:32:00,069 --> 01:32:23,220
unbeatable? I didn't make it unbeatable. I can do this. It's not unbeatable. If I score one point,

420
01:32:23,220 --> 01:32:41,000
if I score one point, I deserve an apology. He bounces off the edges way too fast from his

421
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:55,770
serve. Remember I told you Winnie the Pooh home run derby? That's why I said that. Make my paddle

422
01:32:55,770 --> 01:33:20,380
80. No, I can't. I gotta do it legit. What was that little pause? I don't think I'll ever score.

423
01:33:20,380 --> 01:33:43,000
He's at 200. No apologies. That's all right. That's okay. Not gonna move. I have to apologize to you.

424
01:33:43,000 --> 01:34:15,350
Yeah, okay. That's fair. I thought I had it right there. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, guys. It's my

425
01:34:15,350 --> 01:34:30,090
fault. And that is Shufflepuck. The weird part about Shufflepuck is I used to sit here for hours

426
01:34:30,090 --> 01:34:43,050
and play this. And I've kind of done everything you can do in this game in 25 minutes. Wait a

427
01:34:43,050 --> 01:35:13,939
minute. Hold on. Death is here. Secret character. Is there somebody under the robe? Eat that. Do

428
01:35:13,939 --> 01:35:22,439
Max paddle? No, I don't think I need that. No, it's not death. It's just some kids doing the

429
01:35:22,439 --> 01:35:42,310
trench coat trick to get into the bar. Because they're not 21. I got one point. That's all I care

430
01:35:42,310 --> 01:35:53,989
about. Let me get one more point. Last one. No, I quit. Lost to kids? No, I'm sorry. That rephrase

431
01:35:53,989 --> 01:36:17,609
that. Lost to three kids. All right. That's it. Let's do the next one. Which one? I knew I wanted

432
01:36:17,609 --> 01:36:20,489
to play this and I knew I wanted to play Donald Duck. I have one or two more that I thought were

433
01:36:20,489 --> 01:36:31,510
interesting. Which is it? Yeah, I know. I already like leaked them. I leaked them out already because

434
01:36:31,510 --> 01:36:42,199
you saw the top of the browser. Dino Park Tycoon is the next one. It's already been leaked. Can

435
01:36:42,199 --> 01:36:46,760
we vote on the games? Yes. But I wanted to do these first because they looked the most interesting to

436
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:53,239
me because I saw them pop up randomly. So I wanted to try them. This is Dino Park Tycoon.

437
01:36:57,590 --> 01:37:09,659
It's very possible that I may or may not sit here for another four hours. I don't know. Okay, new

438
01:37:09,659 --> 01:37:18,119
game. The bank has approved a business loan of $5,000. Payments will be made monthly. Remember

439
01:37:18,119 --> 01:37:24,500
that you have to buy land, fencing, dinosaurs, and food. Good luck on your venture. Thank you.

440
01:37:27,159 --> 01:37:35,289
Buy land at the real estate office. Dino Diner. Dino City Big Big Sale. Otherwise,

441
01:37:37,850 --> 01:37:44,439
dinosaurs are people, but they also put people in the parks. Is that what I'm understanding here?

442
01:37:48,460 --> 01:38:00,649
So that's weird. Okay, let's go buy real estate. VA, HA, FHA approved. Okay, so we can do

443
01:38:01,619 --> 01:38:08,659
the desert, plains, or the marsh. Peaceful and remote, dry, hot, and flat. 500 bucks an acre.

444
01:38:09,380 --> 01:38:13,800
The plains is mild weather, fertile land, close to towns, a thousand dollars per acre.

445
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:21,800
Or the marsh. Wet, swampy, plants, and reptiles really love it. I think I have to do desert. This

446
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:36,119
is the first try. That's cute. What a cute game. All right, so buy. Select a plot of land to

447
01:38:36,119 --> 01:38:53,079
purchase. Front gate is here. Public restrooms. Office food? Foods. This one? Sold. How much money

448
01:38:53,079 --> 01:39:06,260
should I spend? Food? All right, all of it. No, I only have four grand. I'm not going to buy it all.

449
01:39:07,300 --> 01:39:14,340
This is good for now. What about one place in the office? All right, I'm going to do one

450
01:39:14,340 --> 01:39:22,260
office. Restrooms are included, aren't they? All right, that's good. Okay, I got food, one extra

451
01:39:22,260 --> 01:39:31,560
little part of the park, and then an office space here. The other money I can spend on dinosaurs.

452
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:42,359
Buy fencing at the general store. Order form. All right, you can find it all in the general store

453
01:39:42,359 --> 01:39:55,000
catalog. Fences. Wood. Thousand dollars a pen. Cement wall or electricity. This wood fence,

454
01:39:55,000 --> 01:40:11,510
wood keeps in dinosaurs? Which one's the cheapest? Let's do wood. Oh, shit. Okay,

455
01:40:11,510 --> 01:40:23,609
I'm going to put it over here. Should I do it on all of them? Do I need a fence around the office?

456
01:40:24,409 --> 01:40:39,460
I don't need a fence around the office. That's going to be fine. All right, that's done.

457
01:40:42,149 --> 01:40:53,699
Hire an employee here. I'm almost out of money. 1,400 bucks a month? I don't have any,

458
01:40:54,260 --> 01:41:02,439
I have no money. Maintenance, concession, security, tour guide, management?

459
01:41:05,140 --> 01:41:17,079
Maintenance? Uh, did you just put that in his nose? Maintenance. Holy shit, he's ripping off

460
01:41:17,079 --> 01:41:23,939
his nose. That's a fake nose. His real nose is underneath. I don't know why, why does he want

461
01:41:23,939 --> 01:41:48,659
to make his nose bigger? I'm not going to be able to afford a dinosaur. Don't hire anybody. Hold on.

462
01:41:49,539 --> 01:41:59,979
One maintenance worker. I'm going to need it. Buy a dinosaur at Dino City. Albertosaurus,

463
01:42:01,420 --> 01:42:14,970
Ankylosaurus, Colophysis, Dino-niches, Edmontosaurus, Allosaurus, Corythosaurus.

464
01:42:15,609 --> 01:42:25,619
These are too expensive. Um, I can only afford a Coli-physis or a Dionysus. Diono-chis,

465
01:42:27,979 --> 01:42:50,170
Dionysus, Colo-cholophysis. All right, let's do a Dino. Is it Dino-niches? Dino-niches?

466
01:42:51,050 --> 01:43:06,539
Dino-niches? All right, I'm going to do Dino. Get it. Buy it. What do I do with the egg? I have

467
01:43:06,539 --> 01:43:20,420
250. It's already hatched. Okay. Oh, okay. Put it over here. One Dino. Cool. Now what do I do?

468
01:43:20,420 --> 01:43:31,130
Buy food for the dinosaur. What does he eat? I don't know what this dinosaur eats. Somebody

469
01:43:31,130 --> 01:43:57,930
look it up. Type in, is a Dio-niches a herbivore? Is it meat? $25 a unit. Get out of here. All right,

470
01:43:57,930 --> 01:44:12,039
nobody move. Small feeder. I guess I'm just, it's, let's do two, three, four units. How much is too

471
01:44:12,039 --> 01:44:20,470
much? Set an admission. Oh, here we go. Let's make the money back. Admission prices. Business,

472
01:44:20,470 --> 01:44:31,640
business is bought and sold. Tickets. Nobody is coming to the park. Uh, what? General ledger,

473
01:44:31,640 --> 01:44:41,930
inventory, visits, food, gifts, staff, profit, loss. How do I do this? Check profit statement.

474
01:44:41,930 --> 01:45:00,310
Where's, where's like a guy bank? Current balance. Snacks? So I can't set these? Am I missing

475
01:45:00,310 --> 01:45:10,739
something here? Set the price of the park. You have one Dino and two unused pens. Yeah, tickets,

476
01:45:10,739 --> 01:45:17,960
but it says nobody is coming to the park. No, I don't want to sell the park. You have no

477
01:45:17,960 --> 01:45:46,699
concessions to sell food. Get a loan. Uh, did I do it? Dino, diner, land, general store employment,

478
01:45:50,149 --> 01:46:00,229
staff. Okay. Some more tour guides might be nice. You have four units of meat. You have one. How

479
01:46:00,229 --> 01:46:15,340
do I set the park? Is it, it's not, is it just free? Set admission prices in here. Visits? Oh,

480
01:46:15,340 --> 01:46:23,609
okay. Hold on. Ticket prices for winter. That's fine. Spring. It's going to be more summer. Way

481
01:46:23,609 --> 01:46:39,800
more fall as it can be for this is prime season here. All right. That looks good. Select the park

482
01:46:39,800 --> 01:46:58,569
icon to start. I'm ready to go. Here we go. Is that the dinosaur? Why is he doing a fighting game

483
01:46:58,569 --> 01:47:22,229
entrance? Meat. He does one unit of meat a week. Oh, I'm making money rapidly. All right. Where's

484
01:47:22,229 --> 01:47:31,899
the other pens? This place sucks. This place is terrible. There's a dug hole with water port in

485
01:47:31,899 --> 01:47:48,939
it. It's one dinosaur. There's no paths. I like the song though. All right. Let me get another,

486
01:47:48,939 --> 01:48:02,199
let me get another dinosaur. Cops are here. 4,000? All right. Buy food with dinosaur. How many days

487
01:48:02,199 --> 01:48:14,039
has it been? No, I want another dinosaur. I want an expensive one, a nice one. There's more. Where's

488
01:48:14,039 --> 01:48:22,100
the T-Rex? T-Rex 9750. That's what I want. I have a wait until then. I need a tour guide.

489
01:48:23,180 --> 01:48:31,750
Your dinosaur is going hungry. Buy food. What? Just get this shit out of me.

490
01:48:32,789 --> 01:48:50,939
Should I do a medium unit? Okay. I need a tour guide. Tour guide 900 bucks a month.

491
01:48:52,699 --> 01:49:05,899
That's right. Okay. The tour guide for my one dinosaur in my pool. All right. I want some more.

492
01:49:05,899 --> 01:49:22,039
Let me get a T-Rex in here. Is he getting bigger? I'm real. I just hired that person 900 bucks a

493
01:49:22,039 --> 01:49:31,399
month to just be standing here pointing this way, which effectively a wooden sign could do.

494
01:49:32,619 --> 01:49:39,609
A wooden sign that says Dionosaurus with a blurb about what the dinosaur is could be right here

495
01:49:39,609 --> 01:49:52,699
with the arrow pointing that way. End of winter quarter. Why am I losing money? Oh, right, right,

496
01:49:52,699 --> 01:50:06,729
right. Auction today? For what? Next up we have an Ankylosaurus. Can we have a starting bid at

497
01:50:06,729 --> 01:50:14,659
3,000? We've got 3,000. The guy with the straw hat. Can I get 3,100? 3,300. Is that a good look

498
01:50:14,659 --> 01:50:25,479
it up? What kind of is it? Is it a good dinosaur? Five and a half, five and a half, five and a half,

499
01:50:25,479 --> 01:50:37,479
five and a half. I'm gonna bid Mickey Mouse. This is this animal kingdom. This is where it started.

500
01:50:37,479 --> 01:50:39,560
This is so much money. 5,000?

501
01:50:43,640 --> 01:50:55,380
It's me, right? Did I overpay? 48.50? Is that too much? What should I? All right, go over here.

502
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:32,899
Next up we have... I blew all my money. A lot of five and a halfs. Sounds like a washing machine.

503
01:51:39,159 --> 01:51:47,159
That's really good. He sounds like... Hey, I'll bid on this one! Juan De Baron, South American

504
01:51:47,159 --> 01:52:12,329
rancher and animal trainer. Tours dinosaur troop worldwide. Headlines Las Vegas. Bid. All right,

505
01:52:12,329 --> 01:52:24,359
no more, no more, no more. 2,100 is my last... I'm up. I'm not going higher than 23. No, you guys

506
01:52:24,359 --> 01:53:01,109
are paying too much. No one's bidding. It said Bernie is bidding big. I've gotta have that

507
01:53:01,109 --> 01:53:20,600
dinosaur. It's really important that I get that home with me. I'm just gonna leave. What the...

508
01:53:20,680 --> 01:53:30,060
I'm just standing here. Wait, let me see. Friz Farflung, genetic research engineer working on

509
01:53:30,060 --> 01:53:39,000
secret government project dealing with dinosaur relativity. I don't have five and a half. I have

510
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:50,409
two and a six. All right, let's go. Holy shit, that thing is sick. What does it eat? Vegetarian.

511
01:53:50,409 --> 01:54:01,670
Eats three units a week. Oh man. Uh, okay, I gotta... food. Buy food, food, food, food, yeah.

512
01:54:02,390 --> 01:54:08,119
This thing, it's got... how many units? Three units of wheat?

513
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:16,539
Bushes and trees? This is like more high quality food, right? Three, six, nine, 12. Okay, we'll do...

514
01:54:17,670 --> 01:54:25,899
Do I get 12 of like the high quality food? And then I need to get a little bit... hold on. How

515
01:54:25,899 --> 01:54:32,630
much was that dinosaur if I bought it in real life? Well, I mean, if I bought it from here.

516
01:54:33,189 --> 01:54:43,289
Was it called an ankylosaurus? I got a pretty good deal. I paid almost a thousand dollars less.

517
01:54:44,010 --> 01:54:53,930
A tour guide quit. I mean, lack of payment. You may not have enough money to pay your bills at the

518
01:54:53,930 --> 01:55:04,010
end of the month. Go to the bank if you need a loan. Uh, a maintenance per... there are no employees

519
01:55:04,010 --> 01:55:21,079
here to feed the dinosaurs. Uh, why is everybody gone? Hire an employee... hold on a second. Wait,

520
01:55:21,079 --> 01:55:24,600
wait, wait, wait. Just hold on. You do not have the money for your loan payment this month. The

521
01:55:24,600 --> 01:55:32,920
bank is foreclosed on your park. Better luck next time. I didn't even get a second. What? I had

522
01:55:32,920 --> 01:55:54,359
nine thousand dollars. It told you everybody quit and then you opened the park. Oh, I did...

523
01:55:57,750 --> 01:56:02,470
one more time. One more, one more, one more. I know I got it. I know what to do now.

524
01:56:05,300 --> 01:56:13,460
This time, I'm gonna buy one. We're gonna go to the marsh. I'm gonna buy an office space here

525
01:56:13,460 --> 01:56:21,859
and I'm gonna buy one here. I'm gonna buy two. Okay, don't let this distract you from the fact

526
01:56:21,859 --> 01:56:27,770
that Jerma sneezed into his hands. Would you rather me open up my pants and sneeze down

527
01:56:27,770 --> 01:56:43,819
into my underwear? What are you talking about? I need fences, wood. I'm gonna go right here and

528
01:56:43,819 --> 01:56:48,359
right here. Two dinosaur enclosures. I'm already out of money. How? I'm going right to the bank.

529
01:56:48,920 --> 01:56:56,520
What did I do that was different? Hire an employee here. No, no, no, not yet. Where's the... I need

530
01:56:56,520 --> 01:57:08,470
the bank. Okay, I need, uh, I need to borrow some money. Sorry, your credit limit has been reached.

531
01:57:10,920 --> 01:57:21,260
What? That's a dog shit interest rate too. You should be ashamed of yourself.

532
01:57:24,630 --> 01:57:40,039
Hold on. What am I supposed to do? All right, I'm only supposed to have one enclosure.

533
01:57:42,819 --> 01:57:52,460
I have an idea. Okay, just bear with me for a second. Just bear with me for one second.

534
01:57:52,460 --> 01:58:10,010
I'm gonna make it really expensive. Not that expensive though. That's too much. That's the

535
01:58:10,010 --> 01:58:14,250
roller coaster tycoon with the little AI walks up to the line and immediately turns away.

536
01:58:16,170 --> 01:58:25,909
No, we're gonna make it expensive. And I don't have enough for an employee. I have enough for

537
01:58:25,909 --> 01:58:57,109
a dinosaur, don't I? I don't even have enough for a dinosaur. New plan. Cheapest place. That

538
01:58:57,109 --> 01:59:04,300
was not the cheapest place. That's why. Fuck. Okay, it's all right. Just one spot and a spot

539
01:59:04,300 --> 01:59:13,300
for the office. Done. We're gonna fence in that one spot and I'm gonna buy it, uh, uh, somebody.

540
01:59:14,739 --> 01:59:21,479
Wood? No, no, no, no. He's everyone's like, no, no. Why, why, what happened? What do you mean no?

541
01:59:21,479 --> 01:59:25,880
I'll be fine. This time I'm not gonna do it. Um, look, I'm gonna, everything's gonna be fine.

542
01:59:25,880 --> 01:59:48,979
Just wait. I just need a tour guide. Higher. Okay. Done. 2,500. I'm gonna buy a cheap dinosaur.

543
01:59:48,979 --> 01:59:57,399
Let's go with a, uh, a pentaceratops. That's not, that's not as more expensive. That's okay,

544
01:59:57,399 --> 02:00:19,029
though. No, how about an ornithomimus? Yeah. Right here. Ornithomimus is in there now. I have an

545
02:00:19,029 --> 02:00:22,390
employee. Now I just gotta get food and I'm gonna jack the prices up like crazy and I'm not gonna

546
02:00:22,390 --> 02:00:46,840
spend money. So an ornithomimus eats what exactly? Meats and plants. What's cheaper? 12 bucks or 25

547
02:00:46,840 --> 02:00:59,319
bucks a unit. What about seeds? A dollar a unit. That's cheap. You look it up. What, what, what

548
02:00:59,319 --> 02:01:19,140
shit over here? Oh, I'm crushing the bugs. Okay. I get it. Does it eat plants? I didn't look. Can

549
02:01:19,140 --> 02:01:31,899
I just like scrape this off and put it on toast and feed it to him? I'm gonna look it up. Office.

550
02:01:31,899 --> 02:01:45,689
Okay. Dinosaurs, right? Where's my guide to dinosaurs? Types of dinosaurs. There it is.

551
02:01:47,399 --> 02:01:55,979
Occasionally bipedal and ranged in size from a dog to an elephant. Now that's not it. Where is it?

552
02:02:03,300 --> 02:02:15,020
Ornith, ornithor, ornithomimus. What does it eat? A guide to dinosaurs through the ages.

553
02:02:15,100 --> 02:02:20,199
Types of dinosaurs. Theories about dinosaurs. Okay, here we go. Ornithor, ornithomimus.

554
02:02:21,640 --> 02:02:40,619
Vegetarian eats two units a week. You got it. Let's jack the prices up. Not that much. Six,

555
02:02:40,619 --> 02:02:48,550
six fifties. Fine. Seven in the summer. All right. Two units of vegetables a week.

556
02:02:50,359 --> 02:03:03,289
We have a tour guide. We're gonna do small feeders. I'll buy 10 units. Fuck, that was me.

557
02:03:03,289 --> 02:03:17,180
That was me. That's it. That was ha ha ha. At least I own it. Open the park. Let's go.

558
02:03:17,180 --> 02:03:40,710
Here we go. Come on. Where are all the people? Oh boy. Seven dollars to see a single stupid

559
02:03:40,710 --> 02:04:01,399
dinosaur nobody's ever heard of. What's wrong with that? This dinosaur is cool. Why do you

560
02:04:01,399 --> 02:04:21,939
have such a problem with this dinosaur? I think he's cool. Although I need more people. Spend

561
02:04:21,939 --> 02:04:45,689
money on your dinosaur is going hungry. Okay, now I'm gonna let's go to the I have two spots,

562
02:04:46,630 --> 02:04:57,670
right? Should I get another employee? No, I need to build up money first. Maybe I should get another

563
02:04:57,670 --> 02:05:06,180
small dot. Maybe I should get two of them. They get along in the same pan. I put I put them in

564
02:05:06,180 --> 02:05:22,220
the same pen, right? I gotta lower the prices. You're right. It's too expensive. You're right.

565
02:05:22,220 --> 02:05:27,130
You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. Drop prices. Oh, people are not happy.

566
02:05:27,130 --> 02:05:41,100
Drop it. Five. 450. All right. That should help. There we go. Load up. End of winter quarter.

567
02:05:41,100 --> 02:05:47,979
I'm not gonna click it. I'm not gonna click it. It'll screw everything up. All right. I need more

568
02:05:47,979 --> 02:05:59,060
dino food. How many units I got? Plenty. Let's get some more high quality food in here. All right.

569
02:05:59,619 --> 02:06:10,390
Good. How do I? I got it. I have a pen. I have a second pen. I need a meat eater. Which one of

570
02:06:10,390 --> 02:06:20,810
these eats meat? Does the pentaceratops eat meat? Because I have 10 of them. Who eats meat here?

571
02:06:21,960 --> 02:06:35,539
Me. I do. How about the iguanodon? No. I have to go look it up. Vegetarian. Vegetarian.

572
02:06:36,260 --> 02:06:42,819
Vegetarian. Vegetarian. Vegetarian. Vegetarian. Vegetarian. Vegetarian. Vegetarian.

573
02:06:43,619 --> 02:06:52,710
Meat. No. I already had you. Vegetarian. Meat. No. Vegetarian. Vegetarian.

574
02:06:54,229 --> 02:06:57,909
The allosaurus is two units of meat a week. I want an allosaurus.

575
02:06:59,539 --> 02:07:08,199
No. Climate is wrong. I need a wetlands dinosaur. What's the cotton candy one? That's

576
02:07:08,199 --> 02:07:19,109
the tyrannosaurus? Okay. No. That's splatoon dinosaur. He was just underground sliding around

577
02:07:19,109 --> 02:07:35,909
in splatoon. Uh. Vegetarian. Vegetarian. Marsh. Here we go. Does nobody from the marsh eat meat?

578
02:07:37,220 --> 02:07:49,029
Desert. Desert. Marsh. Vegetarian. Marsh. Vegetarian. Come on. Really? You gotta be

579
02:07:49,029 --> 02:07:57,050
kidding me. None of... I have to just get another... whatever. I'm just gonna get another

580
02:07:58,569 --> 02:08:08,890
dinosaurus. Whatever the hell it is. Or an allosaurus. How much money do I have?

581
02:08:08,890 --> 02:08:31,750
I'm doing it. There's no pen here. I need to get a pen. Please don't come out of the pen.

582
02:08:51,210 --> 02:08:57,819
Stop. I know. I know. But how do I put the fence on? No. No. No. Back up. Back up. Quick. Quick. Feed

583
02:08:57,819 --> 02:09:16,699
the dinosaur. All right. I... I need to go to the general store and get fence. Wood. Right here.

584
02:09:16,699 --> 02:09:31,899
God damn. All right. Will this... I can't even buy another one of these. This thing eats meat.

585
02:09:31,899 --> 02:09:40,390
Just give it to me. That's the one I had last game. Hire people? Not yet. I'll blow all my money. I

586
02:09:40,390 --> 02:09:48,329
need to wait till I have over like 10-15 grand. We're good. Okay. I got two dinosaurs now. How

587
02:09:48,329 --> 02:09:57,300
much meat do I have? Pay the loan. Pay the loan. Pay the loan. Pay the loan. Current loan amount.

588
02:09:57,300 --> 02:10:05,479
Pay off. Monthly payment. I'm doing fine. I don't need to do that. I'm fine. I'm doing a monthly

589
02:10:05,479 --> 02:10:18,949
payment. All right. Now I need to go to food. Make sure I have enough food. I'm almost out of food.

590
02:10:21,380 --> 02:10:31,819
Let's do like 20. Let's just get a bunch. 30. All right. End of spring quarter. I got 10 grand.

591
02:10:33,399 --> 02:10:41,880
I'm gonna hire some people. Management. That's very expensive. Concessions. Tour guide. Maintenance.

592
02:10:42,520 --> 02:10:48,500
Let's get a veterinarian. I thought she just crunched into that egg. Like bit into it.

593
02:10:48,500 --> 02:10:58,729
All right. We have a veterinarian now. 2,700 bucks a month. I have a tour guide. I'm gonna do

594
02:10:58,729 --> 02:11:09,750
a concessions chef. 3,800 bucks a month. All right. Slow down. Maintenance. I already have maintenance

595
02:11:09,750 --> 02:11:23,050
guide, don't I? All right. This is half my money. I can't do anything else. I bought so much food.

596
02:11:24,119 --> 02:11:47,300
Who's going hungry? What? We're good. I need another pen. General store.

597
02:11:48,420 --> 02:11:59,510
Should I get another pen? General store. Concessions. Food stand. Sell treats like dino dogs.

598
02:11:59,510 --> 02:12:10,039
Wait. We're eating them. Restrooms. Get them up there. Buy them. A gift stand.

599
02:12:10,119 --> 02:12:21,319
Parking lot. Food stand. That's 5,000. I can't do it. I have a chef who's just walking around in

600
02:12:21,319 --> 02:12:27,909
a chef costume. He's not doing anything. I handed him a broom and I was like, can you sweep up a

601
02:12:27,909 --> 02:12:50,390
little? I'm doing it. Fuck it. All right. Do I have food here? Is it there? Okay. I think I'm good.

602
02:12:52,810 --> 02:12:59,060
Uh oh. Bleeding money. Bleeding money. What do I do? I have to fire somebody. Fire the chef.

603
02:12:59,060 --> 02:13:21,460
Where's the other pen? Wait. Hold on. No, no, no, no, no. Go back, back, back. Who is starving?

604
02:13:23,189 --> 02:13:40,970
I am bleeding money. Bushes and trees. Buy a worker. I have like 10 workers. No, no, no, no, no,

605
02:13:40,970 --> 02:13:57,510
less, less, less, less. End of the summer quarter. Let's put those ticket prices up or down. I need

606
02:13:57,510 --> 02:14:01,029
to look at my, I gotta go to the office. I gotta look at see what's going on here. Check profit

607
02:14:01,029 --> 02:14:15,939
statement. Last month's profits were 900 bucks. Not bad. Let's see. All right. Okay. This is going

608
02:14:15,939 --> 02:14:36,500
to come down though. Wait. Food. Clerks. Stands. How do I make this more money? Staff. 5200 bucks

609
02:14:36,500 --> 02:14:53,369
a month. Who can we lose? Nobody. Um, it's, everything's going fine. I'm going to need

610
02:14:53,369 --> 02:15:07,430
another dinosaur though. A big one. One that can pull in big numbers. Are we doing enough food?

611
02:15:08,310 --> 02:15:38,899
I'm going to get a T-Rex next. I'm already out of fucking food again. All right. Uh,

612
02:15:39,619 --> 02:15:49,270
let me go to real estate for a second. So we've got one here. Spot up there. Spot up here.

613
02:15:50,069 --> 02:16:01,189
What do I got? 5900. How much is a T-Rex? I did it. Okay. Now I'm going to save money until I get,

614
02:16:01,189 --> 02:16:22,619
I can afford a T-Rex. I'm firing somebody too. I'm bleeding money, I think. Fire the tour guide.

615
02:16:22,619 --> 02:16:28,090
No, I think the tour guide is necessary. Should I make the prices cheaper or should I make them

616
02:16:28,090 --> 02:16:42,309
more expensive? Cheaper? To get more people? Why can I not set the prices? Do I have to set the

617
02:16:42,309 --> 02:17:12,120
prices per year? I don't get to change my prices. It's, everything's fine. 49 cheap winter tickets

618
02:17:12,120 --> 02:17:24,059
and expensive summer tickets. Yeah, that's what my theory was before too. This would be an 8 out of

619
02:17:24,059 --> 02:17:36,340
10 stream, but that fly is making it a 6 out of 10. You can't fuck out of here. Your annual income

620
02:17:36,340 --> 02:17:43,030
tax for the park was $333. You're going to tax me. End of the year. Make any changes for first

621
02:17:43,030 --> 02:17:51,770
quarter now. Clock has stopped and will resume when you leave the office. Here we go. So let's

622
02:17:51,770 --> 02:17:59,129
make the ticket price in the winter, 4 bucks. Spring, 5 bucks. Summer, 6 bucks. Fall, 5 bucks.

623
02:17:59,129 --> 02:18:13,139
650. Does it lay the house out? I can't make it that cheap. $7 for summer? That's kind of high.

624
02:18:16,010 --> 02:18:27,530
3, no, 350, 450, 7, 5. 650 and 5. Same thing with food. Let's go. It looks fine, right?

625
02:18:28,729 --> 02:18:39,559
Staff, 52 per month. All right. That seems pretty good. What about my bank loan? Okay. Current

626
02:18:39,559 --> 02:18:46,549
balance is, why is the balance of more than what I, current loan amount, 33. All right. Okay,

627
02:18:46,549 --> 02:18:55,020
I was going to say, what are you talking about? I think that's good. Snacks. You have one concessions

628
02:18:55,020 --> 02:19:04,250
and one food stand. People are vandalizing the property. Get security. Shit. 45 people

629
02:19:04,250 --> 02:19:11,670
came to the park yesterday. That's really bad. How many people go to Disney World every day?

630
02:19:12,229 --> 02:19:29,899
Like 300,000 people. That's not good. 45? All right. I think I'm ready. You have 11 units of

631
02:19:29,899 --> 02:19:42,680
meat and 12 units of plants. All right, let's go. What else do we got? Advertising. Somebody

632
02:19:42,680 --> 02:19:50,340
just said that. Flyers. Cheap way to reach people. Just hand these out. Flyers. Newspaper. What's

633
02:19:50,340 --> 02:19:56,469
this? Free our extra super special deluxe bonus gift package when you spend $10,000 or more.

634
02:19:58,149 --> 02:20:09,180
Oh, all right. All right. Let's do, let's do cheap flyers. And I also need a fence. My money. My

635
02:20:09,180 --> 02:20:28,280
money. My money. Open the park. Ah, why? What's happening? What's happening? Why is this? Hey,

636
02:20:28,280 --> 02:20:46,780
what's happening? What's going on? I need a loan right now. All right. I just got a loan.

637
02:20:55,459 --> 02:21:02,860
I'm just hemorrhaging money. What am I hemorrhaging money on? The staff? There's too

638
02:21:02,860 --> 02:21:12,309
many people that work here. I had to buy food. Oh, I'm in trouble. I have to fire everybody.

639
02:21:12,309 --> 02:21:20,200
How do I fire people? Bring them all in. Bring every, you may not have enough money to pay your

640
02:21:20,200 --> 02:21:25,319
bills at the end of the month. Go to the bank if you need a loan. How do I fire? Fire. Fire. Fire.

641
02:21:25,319 --> 02:21:32,780
Fire. You fired. You fired. You fired. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Staff. How do I fire people?

642
02:21:34,280 --> 02:21:37,959
How do I fire people? There's no way I can't. People are throwing rocks.

643
02:21:38,680 --> 02:21:58,760
I'll sell it. You've made the top 10 list. What's your name? Yoink. See you later. Somebody else's

644
02:21:58,760 --> 02:22:20,920
problem now. Stop playing and hope they don't notice. Well, that's that. That was cute. That

645
02:22:20,920 --> 02:22:29,379
was cute. Uh, the next one that I have here selected, this should be an interesting one.

646
02:22:29,379 --> 02:22:34,020
It's called Rockstar. Well, you, you play as a rock star. You have to be a rock star or something.

647
02:22:34,739 --> 02:22:46,790
It's just seem like a fun thing to do. Uh, those mesmerizing new age hypnosis. The wizard game.

648
02:22:46,790 --> 02:22:50,469
Proudly. No, Fred, your amusement and amazement, bewilderment and confusion. The latest

649
02:22:50,469 --> 02:22:54,950
psychedelic is driving against rock star. Welcome to the wonderful world of wizard games. You've

650
02:22:54,950 --> 02:22:58,549
never seen anything like this before. We don't waste your money on fancy packaging and glossy

651
02:22:58,549 --> 02:23:03,989
advertising. We won't insult your intelligence with childish graphic challenges. We just write

652
02:23:03,989 --> 02:23:07,750
unique games that you will be addicted to where nothing is ever the same twice. You're not entering

653
02:23:07,750 --> 02:23:14,649
the world of your own imagination where nothing can be taken for granted. So beware all concepts,

654
02:23:14,649 --> 02:23:22,440
coding and artwork by wizard games credit where credit is. Do you want to load an existing game?

655
02:23:24,309 --> 02:23:32,739
Uh, no, the folders, the full enhanced version. Uh, so you want to be a rock and roll star? Well,

656
02:23:32,739 --> 02:23:36,020
listen now to what I say. Just get yourself an electric guitar and find some time to learn

657
02:23:36,020 --> 02:23:40,979
how to play in a week or two. That's what this game is all about. In a week, learn how to play

658
02:23:40,979 --> 02:23:48,459
the guitar in a week. Sex, drugs and rock and roll. You have learned to play and got a band together

659
02:23:48,459 --> 02:23:53,739
and now you are chasing the big time. You want to be a megastar to top the world popularity polls

660
02:23:53,739 --> 02:23:59,579
and have number one records everywhere. To achieve this, you must work hard, tour extensively,

661
02:23:59,579 --> 02:24:03,979
spend lots of time and money in recording studios and video studios, do radio and tv

662
02:24:03,979 --> 02:24:08,950
sessions and interviews and generally plan a campaign for world domination. Of course,

663
02:24:08,950 --> 02:24:13,510
you'll find also time to enjoy yourself. There'll be groupies and parties and holidays and plenty

664
02:24:13,510 --> 02:24:19,829
opportunities for overindulgence, but you mustn't overdo it or you'll end up in hospital or even

665
02:24:19,829 --> 02:24:25,989
dead. Luckily your manager, dodgy Sam, your band and your friends question mark are there to give

666
02:24:25,989 --> 02:24:30,309
you loving advice and protection, but are you up to it? Can you cope with the music business and be

667
02:24:30,309 --> 02:24:43,270
a rock star? What skill level do you want to play at? One to five. Two. Three. I'm not doing five.

668
02:24:44,629 --> 02:25:26,440
Three. What is your stage name? Jax. No, not Yoink. Electric Jerma? Electric? Larry Electric?

669
02:25:31,860 --> 02:26:06,090
Is that lame? That's too lame, right? Electric Leo. I don't hate that one. I like Electric Leo.

670
02:26:06,090 --> 02:26:15,879
No, not Larry the Loser. I'm doing Electric Leo. All right, let's go. Done. Do you want to change

671
02:26:15,879 --> 02:26:35,319
any other artists' names? This is a whole roster of... I'm not doing that. Press highlight a key

672
02:26:35,319 --> 02:26:41,879
or cursor keys and return to... All right, you are doing nothing. What do you want to do? Laze

673
02:26:41,879 --> 02:26:49,100
around for a while. Write songs and practice. Gig. Record a single or album. Have a holiday.

674
02:26:49,100 --> 02:27:02,299
Visit your doctor. Consult your analyst. Unwind in a sanitarium. Let's go to the doctor. That was

675
02:27:02,299 --> 02:27:13,719
very fast. Hold on. I should probably slow this down. You are surprisingly healthy. You should

676
02:27:13,719 --> 02:27:21,030
stop smoking. You are quite healthy, really. Eat an apple every day. Let's go back to the doctor.

677
02:27:22,700 --> 02:27:27,719
You're quite healthy, really. You should stop smoking. All right, but my health is... All right,

678
02:27:27,719 --> 02:27:40,229
let's go. Let's laze around for a while. New music maker UK popularity poll published today. New

679
02:27:40,229 --> 02:27:46,069
single released by AYDS called Yellow Basket. New single released by The Giant Panda called Swelling

680
02:27:46,069 --> 02:28:01,829
Up. Just do drugs. Your current drug habits are booze. Fairly regular. More drugs, please.

681
02:28:01,829 --> 02:28:14,620
Lots more drugs. Better cut down a bit. Give it up. Continue with the game. Where's my... Do I have

682
02:28:14,620 --> 02:29:08,010
money? Well, what happened? What do you do for drugs? I dabble in some weed air in there.

683
02:29:14,409 --> 02:29:42,739
What happens if I do them all? Okay, I've done them all. So I've done every drug. 100% psycho.

684
02:29:42,819 --> 02:30:30,170
All right, let's write a song. Oh no. What the fuck? What the fuck? What? What? Wait. Whoa. Whoa.

685
02:30:31,049 --> 02:30:45,450
Whoa. Okay. No, no, no, no, no. What the fuck? Out. Out. Out. Jesus Christ. That's not fucking

686
02:30:45,450 --> 02:31:14,120

687
02:31:14,120 --> 02:31:48,040
Damn it. It's your turn. For the love of God. Where do you want to go? They always gotta fuck

688
02:31:48,040 --> 02:32:04,360
it up. That could have been fun too. Not cool. That's not fucking cool. Come on. Let's go.

689
02:32:04,360 --> 02:32:24,680
Where should we go now? It is up to you. Choose wisely. Very wisely. Why can you not see this?

690
02:32:24,680 --> 02:32:58,459
Oh, it broke. It broke. It broke. All right. Now you can go. You really don't want to play Scrabble.

691
02:32:58,459 --> 02:33:14,100
Codename Iceman. You, you don't want me to play Scrabble. No, you don't. You don't. I can't believe

692
02:33:14,100 --> 02:33:18,940
you really want me to do this. You guys wanted me to get away from the Donald Duck game. Let's be

693
02:33:18,940 --> 02:33:27,420
clear. Stop playing Donald Duck, but dear God, by a huge majority, get into Scrabble and play that

694
02:33:27,420 --> 02:33:56,600
for an hour. Okay. The people who have spoken. It is a great game, but okay. The deluxe computer

695
02:33:56,600 --> 02:34:15,829
edition of Scrabble. 1948. Computers didn't even exist. Look at that mouse. That's an old fucking

696
02:34:15,829 --> 02:34:24,069
mouse. I don't even remember how to play Scrabble. I really don't remember. Okay. Play. File. New game.

702
02:35:55,159 --> 02:36:06,739
CPU dumb has decided to do. Do. That was some like doctor strange shit right there.

I got one shaft. Oh, I wonder what the next CPU is going to do. It's broke.

706
02:37:20,860 --> 02:37:51,159
Why use off its brain power for the last one? Why is it when I move the mouse? I don't understand.

707
02:37:55,379 --> 02:38:04,040
It's going to every letter and doing every single dictionary possibility. Hurry up, please.

708
02:38:04,600 --> 02:38:35,209
I'm doles. All right. CPU dumb is thinking fibs. My score. My time. Um, you know, uh,

02:39:41,590 --> 02:39:59,610

716
02:41:24,440 --> 02:41:37,299
What will it replace? What? What do you mean? What word was that? What word? Oh shit. Um, age.

717
02:41:37,299 --> 02:42:11,690
I don't know. No, no, no, no. Just stop. So all right. I gotta be looking with, uh, time.

718
02:42:12,680 --> 02:42:27,270
I can't do that in 10 seconds. It's not going to happen. CPU one wins. Don't matter. Change the

719
02:42:27,270 --> 02:42:35,590
timer. 30 seconds. Well, I could just, I could just change it to 10 seconds every time, right?

720
02:42:35,590 --> 02:42:53,500
Yeah. I can just take forever. They get 10 seconds. Okay. So we've got, uh, fate time.

721
02:42:54,139 --> 02:43:03,340
Will that work? That it's not time. That's how you misspell time when you talk really fast.

722
02:43:03,340 --> 02:43:36,489
Timer, timer, timer. Uh, add tad mad. I could do mad, mad, mad. CPU one is stumped.

723
02:43:37,209 --> 02:43:47,450
Well, that means they're replacing their words. They're, they're okay. What do you win Scrabble

724
02:43:48,010 --> 02:44:20,500

Enough. No. Okay. It's so unfair. Remap. Okay. CPU dumb is thinking. Doesn't have any words. Okay.

727
02:45:25,379 --> 02:45:31,370
I'm done. I don't want to play this anymore. The timer.

728
02:45:44,700 --> 02:46:01,860
Other options. Edit. No two letter words. No S words. No swear words. No S words.

729
02:46:03,540 --> 02:46:15,399
Special. All right. Let's, let's turn off no S words. Let's see what that does. So then let's

730
02:46:15,399 --> 02:46:47,780
say, let's write shit. All right. We got E. E. Mad. Tiffany. I need another. Okay. I need an F.

731
02:46:47,780 --> 02:46:54,729
I need an F. Is there an F somewhere? Oh my God. It has to be an F somewhere, right?

732
02:46:54,729 --> 02:47:04,180
Where's Tiffany? It can be, the blank can be anything, but I need, all right. Is there,

733
02:47:04,180 --> 02:47:44,600
I can't go like Tiffany. Can I go up? This, okay. You can do nifty. Holy shit. I can go up.

734
02:47:44,600 --> 02:47:57,430
That's 48 points. What do you mean it doesn't work like that? It's Tiffany. What does it say?

735
02:47:57,430 --> 02:47:59,190
I have 48 points.

736
02:48:06,059 --> 02:48:14,299
This is, somebody said this isn't Japanese. Like what, what, what don't, they don't, what are you

737
02:48:14,299 --> 02:48:37,129
talking about? I don't even know what that means. Who reads up? I just didn't know the rules. Why

738
02:48:37,129 --> 02:49:03,899
does it have 48 points then? Bottom to top. Just go with nifty. Oh, my fucking stomach hurts.

739
02:49:05,180 --> 02:49:15,129
That's only going to give me 36 points. If I do the upside down Tiffany, it's 48.

740
02:49:27,909 --> 02:49:36,579
Affinity? Good thing we have a timer. No, it doesn't fit.

741
02:49:48,180 --> 02:50:12,680
How is that less than the upside down Tiffany? Do you understand? I'm doing it. T-I-F. T-I-F.

742
02:50:16,620 --> 02:50:29,770
T-I-F. I'm losing. Listen to me. T-I-F. Tiffany. Tiffany. 48 points. Lock it in.

745
02:51:15,819 --> 02:52:03,180
I'm the timer. What are you going to do? Pass. My turn. E-E-E-Gok. E-Gokturbest.

746
02:52:07,579 --> 02:52:13,659
That's a word. What do you mean the word empty? Yeah, it is.

217 points. Let's go. You can literally add anything. A. A. Chad. Car. You can do better

753
02:54:11,930 --> 02:54:39,370

breath give two good breath you pinch the nostrils closed open your mouth wide

1047
04:16:15,920 --> 04:16:19,639
and take a deep breath you make a tight seal over the victim's mouth and breathe

1048
04:16:19,639 --> 04:16:22,879
into her mouth you take another deep breath and breathe into her mouth again

1049
04:16:22,879 --> 04:16:30,780
watching her chest rise look at this look at this face just like that work I

04:16:40,350 --> 04:16:44,459
look listen and feel again however you still can't get a response

1052
04:16:44,459 --> 04:16:54,760
compressed chest check pulse you check the cardioid artery for five to ten

1053
04:16:54,760 --> 04:17:07,200
seconds trying to find a pulse unfortunately you don't compress chest

1054
04:17:07,239 --> 04:17:23,920
is there anything else I can do begin compression but isn't she dead quickly

1055
04:17:23,920 --> 04:17:26,600
you locate the bottom of the sternum using your index and middle fingers you

1056
04:17:26,600 --> 04:17:30,350
measure up the chest finding the proper point to start the compressions using

1057
04:17:30,350 --> 04:17:34,389
the heel of your hands keeping your fingers from touching the chest you

1058
04:17:34,389 --> 04:17:39,819
start chest compressions at a ratio of 15 compressions to two breaths you act

1059
04:17:39,819 --> 04:17:42,780
fast compressing the chest one and a half two inches at a rate of a hundred

1060
04:17:42,780 --> 04:17:46,940
a hundred eighty two hundred and the excitement you think to yourself I must

1061
04:17:46,940 --> 04:18:07,459
check her pulse in one minute she's already dead okay she's alive again back

1062
04:18:07,459 --> 04:18:22,030
to life this is actually just a CPR tutorial it's getting stronger oh it

1063
04:18:22,030 --> 04:18:27,409

1066
04:18:40,790 --> 04:18:45,690
attempting to get up she insists on standing so you help her up I don't know

1067
04:18:45,690 --> 04:18:54,030

05:05:42,340 --> 05:05:49,770
hey JG Wentworth take all that money you get the annuity right but then they

1262
05:05:49,770 --> 05:05:56,360
give you like a percentage of what it would be upfront so let's say it was

1263
05:05:56,360 --> 05:06:00,279
over the course of a 10-year period you're gonna get $100,000 you would call

1264
05:06:00,279 --> 05:06:05,680
JG Wentworth and they'd give you like like sixty eight thousand or sixty

1265
05:06:05,680 --> 05:06:12,799
eight hundred six whatever it is sixty eight thousand immediately right or is

1266
05:06:12,799 --> 05:06:24,389

05:06:24,389 --> 05:06:30,200
years but I want sixty five thousand dollars right now that's where those

1268
05:06:30,200 --> 05:07:04,259

in fact just to make sure i could prove this to people but how does no i'm i was going to

1366
05:33:55,459 --> 05:34:11,979
draw a keyboard without looking but how but i can't prove that i listen i know where every key is

1367
05:34:14,139 --> 05:34:21,259
on the keyboard but my problem is not in knowing where the keys are my problem is hand placement

1368
05:34:21,900 --> 05:34:28,619
and when i move my finger let's say for instance like f g t r that little spot there like asdf

1369
05:34:28,619 --> 05:34:34,779
put do it do this with me at the same time pinky on a ring finger on s middle d index f

1370
05:34:35,659 --> 05:34:43,819
and then jkl semi right your thumbs are open sit there with me so you have jkl semi asdf

1371
05:34:44,540 --> 05:34:54,659
i know that r is right here above f i know it is but i can't i'll miss because i can't see it

1372
05:34:54,659 --> 05:35:06,380
i can't see the physical button and it's hard for me i can't do it i miss i know that the letters

1373
05:35:06,380 --> 05:35:12,639
are there but the my placement of my fingers and moving my hands across the keyboard my i can't do

1374
05:35:13,200 --> 05:35:23,939
i'm fucking dumb okay just try it it's not gonna work anthony smith corona may equal his world

1375
05:35:23,939 --> 05:35:27,779
record speed of 32 words per minute can you leave him in the dust begin typing to start your

1376
05:35:28,340 --> 05:35:36,529
engine all right i'm gonna try it jkl semi brazen gazelles

1377
05:36:05,889 --> 05:36:10,770
i can't see i need to know what they are because i can't i need to get it into memory so i can

1378
05:36:10,770 --> 05:36:38,849

1379
05:37:08,319 --> 05:37:13,540
i have to look up and down up and down up and down to see that the next

1380

1384
05:38:51,180 --> 05:38:54,939
look at the keys as they type let's see how accurate you can be on these hurdle words without

1385
05:38:54,939 --> 05:39:05,250
the key tops showing what do you mean key tops you must type each key correctly before moving

1386
05:39:05,250 --> 05:39:15,619
ahead the next key you type will start the lesson i have to can my face i don't need clothes on

rubber mask of my own face i don't want to do this anymore do i have to do the whole alphabet okay

1396
05:45:19,680 --> 05:45:39,490
almost done i can't do it i actually can't do this i can't do this you look like a ventriloquist

1397
05:45:39,490 --> 05:46:20,290
dummy why don't i just go get a goddamn shirt on that's better these words are hard this is

1398

like the brain hurt words okay that was fun get this off of me cameras off right yeah get this

1399
05:46:49,150 --> 05:47:07,680
fucking thing off me uh i don't want to do this anymore my head hurts i'm gonna try to do this as

1400
05:47:07,680 --> 05:47:26,770
fast as possible i don't care if i make errors did i mess up too many times he was not used to

1401
05:47:26,770 --> 05:47:55,099
the heaviness of the earth's atmosphere yeah i would how the fuck do some of you guys do this

1402
05:47:55,099 --> 05:48:13,200
shit how do you do 100 words a minute i don't even know how that's possible that's so so fast

1403
05:48:33,090 --> 05:48:46,220
speed hold on a minute speed by key i hit n r y and h the fastest that's kind of interesting

1404
05:48:50,860 --> 05:48:59,490
all right so yeah n r y h i d are the ones i hit the fastest all right uh words minute by session

1405
05:49:00,380 --> 05:49:20,740
no accuracy by key i can always get the z i the s j and t are my problem zones all of them

1406
05:49:20,740 --> 05:49:32,659
are apparently number of keys i don't think even did any of those errors by hand my left hand

1407
05:49:33,380 --> 05:49:41,139
if only i didn't have this left hand that actually kind of makes sense though

1408
05:49:44,060 --> 05:49:59,279
errors by row interesting recovery rate after errors t r e a okay that's funny

1409
05:50:04,500 --> 05:50:25,889
uh backspace errors n has the most interesting that's pretty funny surprisingly good software

1410
05:50:26,529 --> 05:50:36,779
i mean this i think don't they still make this i so doesn't doesn't mavis

1411
05:50:37,580 --> 05:50:47,380
are they still just they still have it right all right let me uh let's do one more

1412

1449
06:01:06,799 --> 06:01:18,900
yeah i saved you all right that's gonna be it right at the six hour mark those were quite a few

1450
06:01:18,900 --> 06:01:28,799
uh games by the way i can still hear it though so i have to turn this off get out of my head what

1451
06:01:28,799 --> 06:01:34,560
the fuck okay i don't know if it's just me is it just me because when i took out my headphone

1452
06:01:35,200 --> 06:01:44,540
it was like is that happening anybody else take your headphones out right now it was like

1453
06:01:51,740 --> 06:02:17,709
um i my voice right now is dude that was fucking wild shattered eardrum no it wasn't but it was

1454
06:02:17,709 --> 06:02:25,069
on very low it's just that sound just permeated my brain maybe you should go to the doctor tomorrow

1455
06:02:25,069 --> 06:02:41,060
yeah maybe no anyways that's gonna be it so i not 100 positive about this there is probably

1456
06:02:41,060 --> 06:02:52,430
gonna be a stream tomorrow depending on if um i can get this all set up i don't know how long

1457
06:02:52,990 --> 06:03:00,770
that will be or maybe i won't i don't know it depends on how this whole thing gets set up

1458
06:03:01,330 --> 06:03:09,979
i'm not sure i was invited to play uh terraria with mr star so i don't know if he's streaming it or

1459
06:03:11,099 --> 06:03:15,740
if i'm gonna turn on a stream we might just play i don't really know what's gonna happen

1460
06:03:16,540 --> 06:03:28,259
so i really don't know because i usually do three days on and then a few days off i do usually two

1461
06:03:28,259 --> 06:03:32,819
three days on and then two or three days off so tomorrow is very tentative to i really have no

1462
06:03:32,819 --> 06:03:40,000
idea if there is a stream tomorrow it'll be kind of random there's no time tomorrow if it's like oh

1463
06:03:40,000 --> 06:03:45,200
hey it's set up and the server works and everything works fine and it's like six o'clock or something

1464
06:03:45,200 --> 06:03:51,680
pacific then i'll just turn it on or something so i don't really have a time frame for tomorrow

1465
06:03:51,680 --> 06:04:02,020
i have no idea just whenever it happens if it happens there you go there is uh still the

1466
06:04:02,020 --> 06:04:09,549
possibility that because the last thing that star said was we need to get like some mod thing

1467
06:04:11,139 --> 06:04:18,860
and that was it i don't know if maybe there'll be server issues i don't know it might happen

1468
06:04:18,860 --> 06:04:33,500
should be interesting regardless but uh i will see you probably tomorrow take care everybody

1469
06:04:33,500 --> 06:04:45,470
good to see you we are going to go back to uh six hours ago uh should be pretty quick tonight

client of that game does that still exist did i upload that on my channel or was that on an

1490
06:07:43,139 --> 06:08:00,450
old machinima channel years ago because i know i the whole grandpa call of duty stuff all were

1491
06:08:01,250 --> 06:08:04,610

in older crates where players are unlocking rare unusuals as common as dirt items and the hat

1499

1500
06:09:32,299 --> 06:09:37,819
turned on actually if you were not here i kind of gave my thoughts on it they'll patch it they'll
