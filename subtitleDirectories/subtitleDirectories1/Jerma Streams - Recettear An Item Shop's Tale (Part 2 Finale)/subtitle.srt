00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:47,880
Hi guys, welcome back. Those of you that joined us yesterday, we're going to be continuing. Sit down, sit down. Someone's standing on their desk back there. Get sit down. Calling your fucking mom to tell her about all the things you do wrong here in this room. I'm going to do item shop again. Reset here. Receipt here. Part two. I'm having a lot of fun. We are our newest hurdle we have to climb up here is

2
00:00:47,880 --> 00:02:32,150
$200,000. I don't know. I almost didn't do the last one. $80,000 seems very difficult to go over. I'm going to do my best to try to get past $200,000. But anyways, relax, stretch your legs out. Stretch your back out. We'll be going very shortly. See you in two seconds. Mouse off screen. I already know. So here I freaked out. And this is a day. Imagine you can do this to shit in real life.

3
00:02:32,150 --> 00:03:18,789
Wait, my bills are due. My bills are due on the 21st. Hold on. Let me go through the whole day and try to make as much money and try to like sell stuff as fast as I possibly can. And then did I do it tomorrow? If only that were possible. IRL or in the game? Well, I mean like IRL. You could do that in real life. Well, the idea is you try to pay your bills on time and not have a fantasy of freezing time to be able to pay your bills in one day.

4
00:03:18,789 --> 00:04:05,250
Anyways, procrastination. That's not that that's really bad procrastination. I understand like not brushing your teeth for a day and like waiting until 730 p.m. before you like fuck. I probably should brush my teeth. That's procrastination. Waiting until 1159 the day before your bills are due. That's irresponsibility. Let's just come on. Let's just call it. Come on. Anyway, here's our shop.

5
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:50,670
You see on the 29th, we owe $200,000. We got a long way to go. So what the hell? What was the last thing I did? Let's see. Yes. And those look, we have a whole new slew of people that are going to come to the stream. And we I know it is an animated Japanese style television game. But just give it a minute. Because I know you just heard that. You heard that sound and you were just like, I'm out of here. But just wait. This game is very fun. Just give it a minute.

6
00:04:50,670 --> 00:05:39,709
We gave it a few minutes yesterday. We gave it actually seven and a half hours yesterday. It was worth it. Turn the voice off. I'm gonna get shit for this. But I turned. I turned the voice down since yesterday. I didn't think anybody was gonna notice and you probably wouldn't have noticed except for somebody said that they could hear it. That's all right. That's a decent level. Oh, god damn it. There. That's better. All right. See, you're fine. Anyways, we're

7
00:05:39,709 --> 00:06:28,850
the whole point of this game. If you weren't here yesterday is you got to buy high sell low. You got to bind items. You got to put them in your store and then people buy them and you got to haggle with them. So what's what was the last thing that happened here? We just got the new day here. I'm gonna put the wooden chess piece here. Wait, wait, I just I just didn't get a really expensive fucking item. I did right here. $15,000. There was other things. All right, all this shit. I want to hear the voices. I did. They're fine. I turned it back up.

8
00:06:28,850 --> 00:07:15,500
Necklace. All right, I think I'm ready to I can't I couldn't I can't craft anything else. All right, I'm gonna hold on to this shit. Here we go. Time to open the store. Oh, charm. Welcome. Hey, girl. Heaven. Are you ever not bright and happy? Nope. A bright and happy welcome is a key to sales. Good products is a key to sales. I got a present for you. Oh, shit. We just got a new fucking hero card. Wait, there's a 60 second slow mode on right now.

9
00:07:15,500 --> 00:08:08,740
That's pretty slow. Hold on. Wait, let me fix it. How about uh, how about uh, 15? 20? What did I just do? Oh shit. I did something wrong. I think I just broke it. Uh oh. Uh oh. Uh oh.

10
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:58,179
Uh oh. There is now no slow mode. And we got 10 seconds slow mode. We got it. I think. Yeah, I think I like turned it off. All right, we're good. We're good. We got a card. I was wondering why I didn't see any POG champs over here. We got a fucking R2D2 card and I looked over and I didn't see any POG champs. I was like, what's going on here? There's gonna be like 2000 of them. Damn straight. If you ever need the help of a professional Burke such as myself, give me a look. Going to negative slow mode. You can't do that.

11
00:08:58,179 --> 00:09:43,629
So are we, are we dumping uh, this dude in here right now? What's his name? Louie? Do a six hour slow mode. You know, I thought about doing a stream before of having a permanent slow mode, like 12 hours or something. So you get to say one thing in chat and you better make it come. Do it. Do it. No, that has to be something that's planned. Not during recetteer and item shops. Actually, that's a pretty great time to do it. No, it's not. I want to get. No, no. I want real feedback of stuff.

12
00:09:43,629 --> 00:10:35,549
I'm selling and buying. Well, receipts been good to me. Consider it my way of paying guys back. All right, we got a new card. By the way, for those of you that weren't here yesterday, when you get a card from somebody, it means that they had to buy them for everybody in the class because so everybody gets a valentine in the class. So you have like 20 cards and you have to hand them out to everybody. Even if you might not want to hand them out to everybody, your mother still tells you to do that. And you're like, ah, I guess come on.

13
00:10:35,549 --> 00:11:16,740
I didn't get one. I only wanted to get my valentine to like my two friends in the class so we could like make jokes on the cards. I couldn't make jokes. Are you really just some random dispassionate loan shark? You should have undid slow mode to max out the minus twos. Yeah, hold on a minute. That's bullshit.

14
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:38,940
10 seconds slow mode. Usually it's like 20 to 30 seconds slow mode. I'm getting dumped here. This is fucking market manipulation at its finest. Anyways, let's go.

15
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:49,120
I've been wondering if all you're really after is getting that loan repaid. Wouldn't it not be a lot easier to steal the house and cash out? Nothing's stopping you after all except for one thing, the law.

16
00:11:49,120 --> 00:12:01,750
That is not it at all. As an agent of Terme, I take a little bit of friendly advice. The harder you try to spin some elaborate tale, the worse it ends up being when the web comes apart at the end.

17
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:22,559
Not that I have any room to lecture on anyone on that front. So sticking to your guns just a loan shark then? Unbelievable! Did you give her your card just to ask me that? Maybe I did. Guess I've been a bit of a busybody, eh?

18
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:45,309
Everyone who comes through that door is like that. That girl. Something about her inspires people to care. I suppose she does that. Are you going to buy something or what? Well then let me know if you need my help. Hey, thanks again.

19
00:12:45,309 --> 00:13:10,159
So thank you for all that. I appreciate the card. Now let's sell something. What can I help you with? I want some food. I got plenty of food. Ooh, holy shit, I got honey. No, no, no, no. This girl's cheap. She won't spend $2,300 on that.

20
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:42,179
Let's go the, let's go the egg toast. $600. That's too much, right? You don't pay over it for anything. She never pays more than like 99% over. She's back again. Alright, I want the fish too. No, no, no. She wants to sell this to me.

21
00:13:42,179 --> 00:14:28,019
45% of base, take it or lose. Yes, I'm not going anywhere. Avocado toast. Stop letting her do this. Alright, Miss Capitalist, in two days I want you to get two scarves for me. I don't know if I can do that. I have to buy them. No, there we go.

22
00:14:28,019 --> 00:15:08,299
I put an order for, uh oh. Probably should have checked that before we started. Should I reload? Yeah, but then we have to do that whole scene again. I would have done, but hold on, this guy's, are we going to get this, this guy's about to drop 15 grand. Should I reset it?

23
00:15:08,299 --> 00:15:44,330
No, that's my own fault. I fucked that up. I need to be a better store owner. Um, this is a big sale here though. We have like 20, 20,000? No, he's not going to pay 200% for this. I'm going to start at 21. Alright, I got to go down.

24
00:15:44,330 --> 00:16:28,480
Shit, uh, 19, 19.5? No, no, it's got to be like 18. Got it. There it goes. Uh, I sold it. Could use a treasure. Do I have any treasure? Eh. I mean, could I just, this is technically a treasure, isn't it? Could I be like, what can I interest you in one of these?

25
00:16:29,659 --> 00:17:14,000
I guess you have to get a statue. 128. It's not under the treasure tab. It's not a treasure. I see, I see. Makes sense. You have a bracelet. I do. I have a really good bracelet actually, don't I? You're not going to, no. She's not going to pay 2600 bucks for this.

26
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:57,779
28. Ah, why did I even try to sell it to you? 25, 26. She does, she doesn't, she never buys anything. Alright, I need to, I got to take some stock here. Hold on. What do we have for orders? So tomorrow, I need two weapons and two foodstuffs by tomorrow.

27
00:17:57,779 --> 00:18:46,430
What do I, I need weapons. Alright, let's go get some weapons. If I was an item in this game, I'd be under the treasure tab. Oh, what? That was so cute. Thank you. Alright, hold on. Let's go to fusion. I need a staff. Alright, bat wings. Backscratcher and impetition staff. I don't have any free honey. I only have one. Can't do that anymore. What else have we got here?

28
00:18:46,430 --> 00:19:22,420
Ooh, the price is currently down on this, but I do have a charred lizard. I have a shell necklace. I could get a shell necklace right now. It's from the other store, right? Let's do it. Wait, wait, wait. I need, no, no, no. I need, no, you're right. I need this for the dude. Fuck. It's alright. I need two weapons then.

29
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:51,079
I'm going to say, um, let's go with the expensive shit. Let's go with the thief's knife and steel sword. I'm going to make cash tonight. And then I need two foodstuffs. I think I already have it. Let's go to the pub. Sit down and find out what we need to do.

30
00:19:51,079 --> 00:20:11,769
Ah, she's drunk. Ah, silly fairy. You can't schtick a person in a cup. Maybe I could stuff you into one though. Hee-tee-hee. You aren't shumadish. Are you drunk or are you doing a Sean Connery impression? I don't understand.

31
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:21,509
I believe I shall pass. Oh, well, you're lost then. You're schtick in the mud. Maybe Rosetta wants shum.

32
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:33,299
What is this? Stop clinging to her for heaven's sake. I swear for professional Burke. You could not hold your liquor at all.

33
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,750
What, you again? I told you no.

34
00:20:40,019 --> 00:20:41,019
What is?

35
00:20:41,019 --> 00:20:45,660
Come on, can't a guy get a break? Cut me just a little slack here.

36
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:55,940
Not just no, but hell no. Do you have any idea how long your tab already is? You'll drink me out of a business at this rate.

37
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:01,940
A son of a... All right, all right. I can take a hint. I'll call it for the day.

38
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:06,079
Who's that guy? Oh, what an argument.

39
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:17,440
Oh, him? That happens all the time. That guy keeps putting stuff on his tab and doesn't pay up, so he keeps getting chased out.

40
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:29,630
I think he even has Louis beat when he comes to be... What? Oh, okay, hold on. I think he even has Louis beat when it comes to being poor.

41
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:35,029
Well, either way, why don't worry too much about it.

42
00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:40,400
The unwise use of money is the human trade, which I find the most perplexing by far.

43
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:51,140
Unwise-ish of... Well, anyway, come on, Rosetta. Your big sis wants to introduce you to a man named Jack.

44
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:54,150
Oh, absolutely not.

45
00:21:54,150 --> 00:22:10,940
The plaza in the evening feels kind of lonely. It makes you think it's really time to go home now.

46
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:15,990
You really think it has that effect? I don't feel... Oh, it does.

47
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:20,990
Oh, the smell of the evening... I thought that said piss. It makes it even lonelier.

48
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:26,000
Well, as a fairy, I cannot pretend to understand how smell could make you lonely.

49
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:33,019
But our dinner tonight is going to be salted porridge. It certainly will not be pie.

50
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:39,670
Salted porridge? That's like the default gross food, isn't it?

51
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:44,619
That's the stuff that comes out of an ice cream scoop in every movie.

52
00:22:44,619 --> 00:22:49,210
Oh, man, now I really feel lonely for some reason.

53
00:22:49,210 --> 00:23:04,609
College life dinner. No, they don't serve that in college dining halls.

54
00:23:04,609 --> 00:23:12,450
You don't line up and have them hand out your tray and somebody dumps porridge onto the tray.

55
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:17,539
That's not a school I don't think I want to be at.

56
00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:38,259
What? What school did you go to where they did a line of porridge? Like Oliver Twist?

57
00:23:39,259 --> 00:24:06,289
All right, let's go. I need to make some money here.

58
00:24:06,289 --> 00:24:09,740
So I need... What do they want?

59
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:13,740
I needed two weapons, which I have, and then two foodstuffs, right?

60
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:19,339
I think I already have that. I do. I have two pieces of food, don't I? Yeah, I do.

61
00:24:19,339 --> 00:24:25,029
Not even 9%. Scaves? What's a scave? Scarves.

62
00:24:25,029 --> 00:24:29,029
Sca... How do you say scarves? Scarves? I thought scarves.

63
00:24:29,029 --> 00:24:45,009
It's got staff and stave. That's what screws me up. Why? Staff, stave.

64
00:24:45,009 --> 00:25:02,309
Scarf, scaves. I could just do two shitty ones. Yeah, let's get the expensive one.

65
00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:09,849
All right, I'm ready. Am I enjoying the game? I think the game's great.

66
00:25:09,849 --> 00:25:22,460
I want... Let's put the helm out there. I have enough food, right? Yeah, I do.

67
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:38,069
Oh, hey, welcome. Hey, Rosette, listen to this. Why do you... Are you still, like, drunk?

68
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:43,569
It's been, like, fucking 12 hours. What is it? And are you okay? You seem a little different.

69
00:25:43,569 --> 00:25:48,259
So, I got a message from the guild today.

70
00:25:48,259 --> 00:25:53,430
They totally found a new dungeon with Shumshishish.

71
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:59,740
Nobody does that when they're drunk. I don't know why everybody decided to take

72
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:05,289
that one old Looney Tunes cartoon of the mouse, going like...

73
00:26:05,289 --> 00:26:14,819
Everybody just copied it. That doesn't happen. Really, really super, really.

74
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:19,960
Everyone is calling it the Amber Garden.

75
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:24,759
Boy, I hope it's that kind of amber.

76
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:42,480
There's a line here I'm crossing where I'm starting to turn into Little Nicky.

77
00:26:43,779 --> 00:26:51,670
Oh, what was I talking about? Oh, yeah, so if you get the chance, we should totally go.

78
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:59,799
I mean, who knows what kind of items we could find. Yeah, items. Yeah, that's true.

79
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:06,500
Well, then, back to the pub with me. Fwoosh. Oh, the Joker.

80
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:16,519
Yeah, that could be the Joker, too. A new dungeon, huh?

81
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:20,519
Ooh, unlocked. Start buying shit.

82
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:36,180
Candy Apple. 2000. Back. You want the helm.

83
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:40,940
Now that, I'm sorry, but that's 2300. Make it a little cheaper.

84
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:46,559
That's a very rare item. It's a warrior's helm. Thank you.

85
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:56,420
Yeah, I sold the warrior's helm. Looking for something?

86
00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:02,720
Oh, the more I look at this, the more I just need to have it. What's your toll in filthy...

87
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,599
Do you buy stuff or are you cheap or what?

88
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:11,970
A little less. 720.

89
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:21,480
Oh, fuck off. Egg. Pick this one. What do you mean egg?

90
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,869
This guy's getting ready to fight. All right, well, hold on.

91
00:28:25,869 --> 00:28:29,940
He's either getting ready to fight or play a game of hockey.

92
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,940
These items could be used for hockey as well. That makes sense.

93
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:47,509
All right, let's do 1000. Same thing.

94
00:28:47,509 --> 00:28:52,390
Two food stuffs. Oh, wait. Yes, I can do two food stuffs in two days.

95
00:28:52,390 --> 00:29:04,339
Here's the end of the day. He's ready to go fight Grandma's ghost.

96
00:29:04,339 --> 00:29:15,130
Hey, can you turn her voice off and also the game, please?

97
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:17,559
That's just not going to happen.

98
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:23,339
News! The price of daggers has increased. Ooh.

99
00:29:23,339 --> 00:29:36,490
The price of daggers has increased. And I got two. This is going to be insane.

100
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:41,750
Hold on. I need to... I'm going to sell these on the floor.

101
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:51,650
Somebody wants... Hold on. I'm buying some stupid shitty item.

102
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:52,819
Wait, what?

103
00:29:52,819 --> 00:29:56,640
I have a little problem, but I need your help where...

104
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,640
We automatically refuse to place horse heads in anyone's bed.

105
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:05,099
I would like a fucking, like, nine-year-old know what that is.

106
00:30:05,099 --> 00:30:11,460
Oh, no, nothing like that. Actually, I have a package that needs to be delivered to the orphanage near the town square.

107
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:14,460
You've seen it, right? I'm a bit busy right now, so...

108
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,460
Oh, yeah, sure. We can do that.

109
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,460
Thanks, girls. This will help me out.

110
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:21,700
All right, then. Package acquired. Charge forth.

111
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,700
Indeed, not a bad idea.

112
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:31,349
The merchant's guilt has been generous to us in the past, so getting them into our pocket now will only help us down the road.

113
00:30:31,349 --> 00:30:34,589
In you are now. Wait. Wait a minute.

114
00:30:34,589 --> 00:30:37,579
For the orphans. Let's go!

115
00:30:37,579 --> 00:30:39,579
Now hold on a second here, girls.

116
00:30:39,579 --> 00:30:45,660
Thank you. I hope everyone enjoys the package.

117
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:48,660
Delivery successful. Forward to Janus.

118
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,660
Now hold on a minute here, girls.

119
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:53,970
Well, I'm glad we were able to... By the way, yeah, I did read that out loud.

120
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:57,849
Well, I am glad we were able to get that done with quickly.

121
00:30:57,849 --> 00:31:00,660
I'll say, everyone seemed to like the package.

122
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:06,970
Although, what do you think they'll do with, I mean, just the...

123
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:11,170
Honestly, I would rather not think of it. What's in the package?

124
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:14,170
Blasted Guild Master, I think I would have preferred the horse head.

125
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:18,240
Well, either way, we pulled it off. Back to the shop.

126
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,990
Is the shop gonna be, like, on fire or something? I don't understand.

127
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,680
What's up?

128
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:29,059
It may be nothing. Over there, however, is that not...

129
00:31:29,059 --> 00:31:32,619
It's the man with the huge bar bill, isn't it?

130
00:31:32,619 --> 00:31:36,559
Yes, but why on earth is he hiding behind a wall?

131
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:41,509
Hey, yeah, that's suspicious.

132
00:31:41,509 --> 00:31:44,509
The four...

133
00:31:44,509 --> 00:31:45,509
Yay!

134
00:31:45,509 --> 00:31:48,289
Wait, receipt!

135
00:31:48,289 --> 00:31:56,990
Hold it! You there!

136
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:58,990
Seize whatever vaguely sneaky thing you're doing at once!

137
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:01,319
Whoa!

138
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:06,009
This is an orphanage. What are you doing here, appearing at it like that?

139
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:08,890
What? Mind telling me who you are?

140
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:12,579
My name is Receit. I run the item shop, Receit, on the hill.

141
00:32:12,579 --> 00:32:16,579
I was on my way home from delivering a package, and I saw you being off-neeking!

142
00:32:16,579 --> 00:32:19,009
Oh, you're the one who runs that whole...

143
00:32:19,009 --> 00:32:21,440
Pretty impressive at your age.

144
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,640
We seem to have gotten off to a bad start.

145
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,640
Name's Elan.

146
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,200
In the strictest terms, I guess you could call me an adventurer.

147
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,890
I kind of owe something to this orphanage, so I stop by Elan.

148
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:38,410
Why all the sneakification and peering then?

149
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:42,099
I wasn't peering, really. I was more gazing at...

150
00:32:42,099 --> 00:32:44,099
I guess with guilt.

151
00:32:44,099 --> 00:32:47,170
What? What are you...?

152
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:50,339
Times have been a little hard lately. You know how it can be.

153
00:32:50,339 --> 00:32:53,710
I can't afford to buy the kids who live their traits anymore.

154
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:58,140
So I think to myself, it'd just be better if I didn't show up at all.

155
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,450
But still...

156
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:02,329
Oh, I see. I'm sorry I was angry at you, but...

157
00:33:02,329 --> 00:33:07,960
Hey! Oh, it's Elan! Elan's here! He's got treats!

158
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:11,519
Oh, shit! Oh, hell's bells!

159
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:16,589
Now they've seen me. Let me... little girl... Do you have any treats?

160
00:33:16,589 --> 00:33:18,589
Gotta let them down and go in empty-handed, I guess.

161
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:21,730
It'll be okay.

162
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:23,720
Huh?

163
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,900
Look at them. The kids appreciate you, not the gifts.

164
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:32,930
Yeah, kind of weird for a merchant to say you don't need gifts, I guess.

165
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:37,130
But it's true, really. Go on, they're waiting.

166
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:40,289
Little miss.

167
00:33:40,289 --> 00:33:45,730
Come play with us, Elan. I'm gonna be the guard, okay? You're the thief.

168
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:48,059
Aye.

169
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:51,490
You're fans await, Mr. Elan. Good luck.

170
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:54,490
Oh, maybe you should go easy on the alcohol, too.

171
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:55,490
For their sake.

172
00:33:58,390 --> 00:33:59,390
She sure told me!

173
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:03,680
Reset of Resetti!

174
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,240
Huh.

175
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:10,190
Go easy on the alcohol.

176
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:16,190
Was it my imagination, or was that a fairy giving me a hell of an evil eye just now?

177
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:20,139
That's not the correct voice for that guy. It's gotta be lighter.

178
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:23,300
I guess that's the wrong voice.

179
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:36,389
Hi, are you okay, miss? You look kinda down.

180
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:41,820
Oh, Resett, I'm tired for some reason. I wonder if I'm starting to get old and slow.

181
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:45,510
If you're tired, it can help to eat something sweet.

182
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:47,510
Don't do that.

183
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:53,460
Sugar stimulates your parasympathetic nervous system and energizes you.

184
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:59,699
That sounds like big company propaganda is what that sounds like, little miss.

185
00:34:59,699 --> 00:35:01,699
I don't know where you got that bullshit from.

186
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:09,610
Anyway, you should go eat something sweet. Like, for example, candy or canned peaches.

187
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:15,579
We have a lot of sweet stuff to choose from.

188
00:35:15,579 --> 00:35:20,579
That does sound good. Maybe I'll have some chocolate cake.

189
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:27,300
Thanks for the advice, you two.

190
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:45,480
Oh, cake. Now I'm jealous. Business opportunity.

191
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,480
Imagine going to the doctor and being like, yeah, something's wrong.

192
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,480
I'm really fucking tired all the time.

193
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:55,909
I kinda feel like shit. I'm sleepy in the morning. I don't have really any energy.

194
00:35:55,909 --> 00:35:57,909
I'm a little bit down.

195
00:35:57,909 --> 00:35:59,909
Oh, well, you should eat just a cake.

196
00:35:59,909 --> 00:36:02,739
What?

197
00:36:02,739 --> 00:36:12,269
Yeah, just eat a cake. See you in a few months when you come back for something else.

198
00:36:12,269 --> 00:36:14,269
You don't think I should probably start exercising?

199
00:36:14,269 --> 00:36:16,269
No, just eat candy out of a jar.

200
00:36:16,269 --> 00:36:24,869
That's the kind of scenario where all of a sudden they've done comedy routines where then that doctor is arrested.

201
00:36:24,869 --> 00:36:26,869
And it's like, holy shit, that guy's pretending to be the doctor.

202
00:36:26,869 --> 00:36:31,059
And the real doctor is in the back, tied up or something.

203
00:36:31,059 --> 00:36:38,349
They've done that before, right?

204
00:36:38,349 --> 00:36:40,349
Alright, let me see. What do I have to do today?

205
00:36:40,349 --> 00:36:47,369
Today is two weapons, two food stuffs.

206
00:36:47,369 --> 00:36:52,019
I have the scarves. I have all the food. I have everything I need.

207
00:36:52,019 --> 00:36:53,019
I got everything I need.

208
00:36:53,019 --> 00:36:58,900
Oh, but wait, wait, wait. Not quite true, though. Hold on.

209
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:03,900
I want to put these out on the floor because I can sell them for way, way more than they're worth.

210
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:10,699
And then I'm going to get two shitty weapons and then overprice the fuck out of them when they come in to buy them.

211
00:37:10,699 --> 00:37:16,820
Or should I overprice the fuck out of these in the order?

212
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:27,820
I wonder. Alright, I'll put them in the order.

213
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:31,250
Let's get the necklace out there. What else do I got?

214
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:34,449
Nobody buys the rings.

215
00:37:34,449 --> 00:37:37,289
Alright, that seems good.

216
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:40,289
Let me just make sure I got plenty of food.

217
00:37:40,289 --> 00:37:42,289
I got the two weapons. I'm ready to go.

218
00:37:42,289 --> 00:37:48,179
Let's get an orange up there, too.

219
00:37:48,179 --> 00:37:50,179
Here we go.

220
00:37:50,179 --> 00:37:55,269
Oh, hello there, receipt. Still manning the store, as always, I see.

221
00:37:55,269 --> 00:37:58,269
Hi, Aluette. You look like you're in a good...

222
00:37:58,269 --> 00:38:00,269
That was fucking loud.

223
00:38:00,269 --> 00:38:03,269
I don't know why. That just scared the shit out of me.

224
00:38:03,269 --> 00:38:06,510
But anyways, thank you.

225
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:08,510
I thought that was in the game.

226
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:11,070
That was fifty dollars.

227
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:14,019
And that was...

228
00:38:14,019 --> 00:38:17,019
Iniuria Palace.

229
00:38:17,019 --> 00:38:20,579
Iniuria Palace.

230
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:21,579
For fifty bucks.

231
00:38:21,579 --> 00:38:25,159
Thank you so much.

232
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:27,159
They say, hey, Jerma, love you a lot.

233
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:30,159
Thank you for all the years of helping me get through tough shit with laughter.

234
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:34,980
Show love a thousand five times.

235
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:41,380
Thank you so much for the fifty dollars.

236
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,380
Much love to you. That's fucking a lot of money. Thank you.

237
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:48,480
And not to derail this, but somebody just said they went to...

238
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,480
I'm not even going to say it.

239
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:53,619
Because that's going to derail the whole stream for like the rest of the night.

240
00:38:53,619 --> 00:38:57,619
I am. Father and I are going on an excursion to eat foie gras in a bit.

241
00:38:57,619 --> 00:39:06,300
What's a foie gras?

242
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,980
It sounds kind of mean.

243
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,980
What? You don't know what foie gras is?

244
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,980
Poverty is a curse.

245
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:15,420
Auteer, help me out over here.

246
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:20,619
Yes, very well.

247
00:39:20,619 --> 00:39:27,570
Foie gras is a food made from goose liver and is generally considered to be a high class dish,

248
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:29,570
due in part to what is involved in creating it.

249
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:34,570
By overfeeding the geese, excess fat accumulates in the liver, significantly changing the taste.

250
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:39,570
The process is lengthy, naturally, as a dish that is typically sauteed and then eaten.

251
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:43,730
Okay, is it yummy though?

252
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:46,730
Naturally, it's a delicacy of the upper crust after all.

253
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:50,289
It utterly lacks any texture.

254
00:39:50,289 --> 00:39:52,289
It's strangely meaty and oily.

255
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:54,289
It's truly the ultimate in rare tastes.

256
00:39:54,289 --> 00:39:56,780
But it's yummy, right?

257
00:39:56,780 --> 00:40:00,860
Of course it is. Silly plebeian.

258
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:05,530
Why can't we just eat shit?

259
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:17,599
We're going to find all these fucked up ways to make food.

260
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,969
How bored are we as a society?

261
00:40:20,969 --> 00:40:25,469
Oh, hi, welcome.

262
00:40:25,469 --> 00:40:27,469
Do you have a hat?

263
00:40:27,469 --> 00:40:31,139
I actually don't have any hats.

264
00:40:37,699 --> 00:40:38,699
Society.

265
00:40:38,699 --> 00:40:44,699
No, I'm sorry the word society has taken on this like meme terminology now.

266
00:40:44,699 --> 00:40:47,699
If you say the word society, it's like, oh, he said society.

267
00:40:47,699 --> 00:40:48,699
He said society.

268
00:40:48,699 --> 00:40:51,960
He said it.

269
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:57,420
I don't have any hats.

270
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,420
I'm sorry.

271
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:03,949
No, it's okay.

272
00:41:03,949 --> 00:41:05,949
If you don't have any, you don't.

273
00:41:05,949 --> 00:41:12,250
Hi there.

274
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:16,219
Oh, do you want to sell you this bread?

275
00:41:16,219 --> 00:41:18,219
31 cents.

276
00:41:18,219 --> 00:41:19,219
It's bread.

277
00:41:19,219 --> 00:41:29,650
I don't want to buy you bread.

278
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:33,739
Oh, here we go.

279
00:41:33,739 --> 00:41:34,920
Okay.

280
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,920
So we got an opportunity to make 10 grand.

281
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:45,280
150, 15,000.

282
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,099
50K.

283
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:49,099
That's not going to fly.

284
00:41:49,099 --> 00:41:57,989
No, that no way.

285
00:41:57,989 --> 00:42:01,170
I'll start at 150.

286
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:02,170
Whoops.

287
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:03,170
No, not one, two, three, four.

288
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:06,170
How about one, two, three, four, five?

289
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:16,519
I think I could do 150.

290
00:42:16,519 --> 00:42:17,519
That's a, come on.

291
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:19,519
That's 150 percent.

292
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:23,170
She will back out immediately if it's too high.

293
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:24,170
That's right.

294
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:29,670
That's a really good price for that ring.

295
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:31,670
I got that ring for like six grand.

296
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:37,500
Hey, do you have my food stuff?

297
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,500
I do.

298
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,570
Let's see.

299
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:42,570
How can I get the maximum amount of money from you?

300
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:46,570
I'm going to hold on to the honey because I feel like I'm going to need it in some recipe

301
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:47,570
somewhere.

302
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:52,340
Candy, apple, and then a beef brain.

303
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:53,340
Perfect.

304
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:56,159
That'll be 6,000.

305
00:42:56,159 --> 00:43:09,369
I wonder if you'll do it.

306
00:43:09,369 --> 00:43:16,360
Slightly, I want a slightly better deal.

307
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:21,739
54, 5,000.

308
00:43:21,739 --> 00:43:26,300
Yes.

309
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:29,570
Inching close to 200k.

310
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:34,329
We have another delivery.

311
00:43:34,329 --> 00:43:36,329
It's the weapons, right?

312
00:43:36,329 --> 00:43:39,530
Do you want a yam?

313
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:43,769
I will take that yam for like 600 bucks.

314
00:43:43,769 --> 00:43:45,769
No, that's insulting.

315
00:43:45,769 --> 00:43:46,769
700.

316
00:43:46,769 --> 00:43:51,699
I'm getting, you're getting scammed.

317
00:43:51,699 --> 00:43:53,699
I'm not getting scammed.

318
00:43:56,829 --> 00:43:59,800
All right.

319
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,190
Weapons.

320
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:04,190
Thief's knife and craft is knife.

321
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:12,460
And this is where we get, this is where we get to be a really bad person because

322
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:15,460
these things are in hot demand right now and it's an order.

323
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:19,460
So I'm thinking like, I'm thinking like 15,000 dollars.

324
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:28,460
14,000, I think.

325
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:36,360
All right.

326
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,360
Okay.

327
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,360
All right.

328
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:42,159
All right.

329
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:44,619
All right.

330
00:44:44,619 --> 00:44:45,619
All right.

331
00:44:45,619 --> 00:44:46,619
12,000.

332
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:49,900
Fuck.

333
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:50,900
No.

334
00:44:50,900 --> 00:45:04,090
Those items are in fucking hot demand.

335
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:07,090
In your palace gave another 50 bucks.

336
00:45:07,090 --> 00:45:12,170
You butchered my name.

337
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:15,170
So here's money to go back to school.

338
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:18,599
I am so bad with names.

339
00:45:18,599 --> 00:45:21,599
Thank you for the hundred dollars though, dude, for real.

340
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:28,659
That's a shitload of money.

341
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:29,659
Thank you.

342
00:45:29,659 --> 00:45:31,739
I want a hat.

343
00:45:31,739 --> 00:45:32,739
I don't have hats.

344
00:45:32,739 --> 00:45:39,969
What's that robots deal?

345
00:45:39,969 --> 00:45:42,400
He's usually 250 to 300.

346
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,769
Oh, that's not good.

347
00:45:44,769 --> 00:45:46,769
Get him off.

348
00:45:46,769 --> 00:45:52,900
Usually 250 to 300 is percent works when it's a red item.

349
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:55,340
Looks like I'm just going to sell them.

350
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:58,500
Accessories are down.

351
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,500
Get that shit out of here.

352
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:12,679
Out here.

353
00:46:12,679 --> 00:46:16,679
I got somebody wanted scarves today, right?

354
00:46:16,679 --> 00:46:20,010
Shoes out here.

355
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:25,639
I need to go on an adventure.

356
00:46:25,639 --> 00:46:26,820
Yeah.

357
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:27,820
Let me fill that order.

358
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:29,820
Let me hold on.

359
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:35,340
Let's get some powerful antioxidants out here or whatever this is.

360
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:37,340
Keep the bat wings.

361
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:38,710
Bake DM up there.

362
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:39,710
No, no, no.

363
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:42,710
Get the bake DM and get the fish up there too.

364
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:51,519
Let's be like a, let's be a grocery store for a little while.

365
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:55,639
Sword out there.

366
00:46:55,639 --> 00:46:56,639
Yeah.

367
00:46:56,639 --> 00:46:57,639
Get the sword out there too.

368
00:46:57,639 --> 00:47:02,460
Who gives a shit?

369
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:03,460
Who cares?

370
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:04,460
All right.

371
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:05,460
I'm going to go after this.

372
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:06,460
After today, I'm going to the dungeon.

373
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:17,650
I can do the new carpet now.

374
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:18,889
Let's go.

375
00:47:18,889 --> 00:47:23,650
Can I help you?

376
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:25,650
I'd like to buy some food.

377
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:28,659
I got you.

378
00:47:28,659 --> 00:47:29,659
I got you.

379
00:47:29,659 --> 00:47:34,460
I got a bake DM right there.

380
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:35,460
2,600.

381
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:37,889
That's too expensive.

382
00:47:37,889 --> 00:47:45,719
2,400.

383
00:47:45,719 --> 00:47:47,719
Jerma's Grocery and Swords.

384
00:47:47,719 --> 00:47:49,659
Yeah.

385
00:47:49,659 --> 00:48:01,789
When she died, my grandmother told me to sell this if I ever got into trouble.

386
00:48:01,789 --> 00:48:06,119
Oh, I just insulted your entire family.

387
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:10,119
Oh, I was looking for one of these.

388
00:48:10,119 --> 00:48:11,119
Where are you now?

389
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:24,139
I think I can get away with like 200 and 200 percent, two or five.

390
00:48:24,139 --> 00:48:26,139
He's broke, but I think it'll work.

391
00:48:26,139 --> 00:48:29,340
75 maybe.

392
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:30,340
72.

393
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:31,340
No, 7,000.

394
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:34,369
Got it.

395
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:42,519
What can I get you?

396
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:48,179
Can I get you to buy this?

397
00:48:48,179 --> 00:48:51,210
100 bucks.

398
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:53,210
Just scamming the elderly.

399
00:48:53,210 --> 00:49:04,780
Here we go.

400
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:07,269
That price isn't right.

401
00:49:07,269 --> 00:49:08,579
1,200.

402
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:09,579
Take it or leave it.

403
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:14,500
Give it to the Twix kids.

404
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:18,219
Oh, here we go.

405
00:49:18,219 --> 00:49:21,539
It pains me to part with this.

406
00:49:21,539 --> 00:49:24,230
It's just a piece of candy.

407
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:28,619
The price is wrong.

408
00:49:28,619 --> 00:49:32,809
Ooh.

409
00:49:32,809 --> 00:49:36,809
Ah, little lady, how much is this crafter's knife?

410
00:49:36,809 --> 00:49:39,809
Well, that would be 3,500 dollars.

411
00:49:39,809 --> 00:49:45,309
That'll do.

412
00:49:45,309 --> 00:49:58,639
Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money.

413
00:49:58,639 --> 00:49:59,639
I'm sorry.

414
00:49:59,639 --> 00:50:00,639
Stop.

415
00:50:00,639 --> 00:50:01,639
Stop it.

416
00:50:01,639 --> 00:50:10,179
I'm all right.

417
00:50:10,179 --> 00:50:17,510
When is that person coming in for their delivery?

418
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:18,510
Tomorrow.

419
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:20,010
All right.

420
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:24,849
I need to go kill the slime like a bunch of times.

421
00:50:24,849 --> 00:50:26,849
Two scarves, two food stuffs.

422
00:50:26,849 --> 00:50:31,699
What else can I put out here?

423
00:50:31,699 --> 00:50:33,699
I'm going to put the shark fin out here.

424
00:50:33,699 --> 00:50:35,699
Before we close, let's get some more.

425
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:41,579
Make sure I got two food stuffs for tomorrow so I'm not putting out any food.

426
00:50:41,579 --> 00:50:45,929
Should I sell the carpets?

427
00:50:45,929 --> 00:50:47,929
I'm not going to use them, am I?

428
00:50:47,929 --> 00:50:53,730
I don't want to get rid of any of these materials unless it's for this.

429
00:50:53,730 --> 00:50:57,079
You know what I mean?

430
00:50:57,079 --> 00:51:13,820
I have a bunch of them, but I feel like I'm going to need them to be out there or whatever.

431
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:17,150
Ooh.

432
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:18,150
Yo.

433
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:20,150
You doing okay, Reset?

434
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:21,579
Oh, Elan.

435
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:22,579
Welcome.

436
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:23,579
You finally came.

437
00:51:23,579 --> 00:51:27,579
Well, I can't afford anything expensive, but I thought I'd drop by.

438
00:51:27,579 --> 00:51:29,269
That's fine.

439
00:51:29,269 --> 00:51:31,960
Looking is free.

440
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:34,960
You're all right, Reset.

441
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,480
Huh.

442
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:38,909
Ooh.

443
00:51:38,909 --> 00:51:39,909
Uh.

444
00:51:39,909 --> 00:51:43,179
Oh, I guess that you two haven't met.

445
00:51:43,179 --> 00:51:44,179
This is Tyr.

446
00:51:44,179 --> 00:51:46,179
She's my business partner here in the store.

447
00:51:46,179 --> 00:51:47,179
Tyr, this is Elan.

448
00:51:47,179 --> 00:51:49,179
An adventurer.

449
00:51:49,179 --> 00:51:55,739
For the record, we do not accept payments on tab.

450
00:51:55,739 --> 00:51:58,739
Notice me in the pub, I guess.

451
00:51:58,739 --> 00:51:59,739
Don't worry.

452
00:51:59,739 --> 00:52:01,739
I'll pay straight here when I'm here.

453
00:52:01,739 --> 00:52:07,099
There's $50 for you.

454
00:52:07,099 --> 00:52:10,619
By Inuria Palace.

455
00:52:10,619 --> 00:52:13,760
I'm just going to call you The Palace.

456
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:17,449
That's $150 from The Palace.

457
00:52:17,449 --> 00:52:22,250
Thank you for the huge amount of money.

458
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:26,250
They say do a Mr. Krabs impression when scamming the elderly, I beg you.

459
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:28,130
All right.

460
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:29,130
All right.

461
00:52:29,130 --> 00:52:30,130
I can't.

462
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:31,130
Spongebob.

463
00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:32,130
I can't.

464
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:33,130
I can't do Krabs.

465
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:34,429
That's a really talented actor.

466
00:52:34,429 --> 00:52:37,340
I can't do it.

467
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:38,340
All right.

468
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:40,019
We're ears.

469
00:52:40,019 --> 00:52:41,019
Nope.

470
00:52:41,019 --> 00:52:43,349
Not going to happen.

471
00:52:43,349 --> 00:52:45,349
I tried, but thank you so much.

472
00:52:45,349 --> 00:52:46,349
So bad.

473
00:52:46,349 --> 00:52:48,679
It's all right.

474
00:52:48,679 --> 00:52:49,679
Some people you can't emulate.

475
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:50,679
You understand?

476
00:52:50,679 --> 00:52:55,429
There are some actors and some voice over artists that you can not emulate.

477
00:52:55,429 --> 00:52:56,429
They'll know.

478
00:52:56,429 --> 00:52:58,429
They'll never be another one that can do that way.

479
00:52:58,429 --> 00:53:07,260
You at least got to try to laugh.

480
00:53:18,659 --> 00:53:27,139
You have to admit that there are some things that you can't do.

481
00:53:27,139 --> 00:53:28,510
Right.

482
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:32,440
There are some things you just cannot do.

483
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:33,440
I'm looking for some food.

484
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:34,440
What happened to the guy?

485
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:36,440
Oh, I was gone.

486
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:40,179
Let's get you.

487
00:53:40,179 --> 00:53:41,179
How about some candy?

488
00:53:41,179 --> 00:53:48,789
Those who can't do teach.

489
00:53:48,789 --> 00:53:52,590
All right.

490
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:53,590
Well, you can't.

491
00:53:53,590 --> 00:53:55,590
Hold on a second here.

492
00:53:55,590 --> 00:53:59,219
I'm not like a fucking eighth grade football coach, guys.

493
00:53:59,219 --> 00:54:01,219
Like, what are you talking about?

494
00:54:01,219 --> 00:54:07,829
No, I'm not.

495
00:54:07,829 --> 00:54:13,489
How?

496
00:54:13,489 --> 00:54:14,489
What are you talking about?

497
00:54:14,489 --> 00:54:26,340
And even if I was, you got a problem with the eighth grade football coach?

498
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:48,420
Those who can't do teach and those that can't teach, teach P.E.

499
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:51,420
You guys are fucking mean.

500
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:56,739
Oh, candy.

501
00:54:56,739 --> 00:55:03,260
The price isn't right at all.

502
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:14,679
Fine.

503
00:55:14,679 --> 00:55:16,679
Chat is filled with evil sludge.

504
00:55:16,679 --> 00:55:17,679
Yeah.

505
00:55:17,679 --> 00:55:21,679
Can we can we like spray this chat with the Ghostbusters 2 fucking nice slime?

506
00:55:21,679 --> 00:55:25,880
You guys need you guys need to be able to get like fucking slime.

507
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:28,880
But I like that pink slime and Ghostbusters 2.

508
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:38,670
Found an apple while cleaning the cellar.

509
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:39,670
That's not worth anything.

510
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:56,179
Oh, sandals.

511
00:55:56,179 --> 00:55:58,000
Thousand bucks.

512
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
That should be good.

513
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:06,340
Two hundred year old relic apple.

514
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:08,659
Can I help you?

515
00:56:08,659 --> 00:56:12,480
I'd like you to buy this, but well, I want a good price.

516
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,480
What an awful negotiator.

517
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:19,489
You just nervously came in here with a Jolly Rancher and put it on the counter.

518
00:56:19,489 --> 00:56:21,489
Um, I want you to buy this from me.

519
00:56:21,489 --> 00:56:22,489
Uh, please.

520
00:56:22,489 --> 00:56:24,489
You don't have to if you don't want to though.

521
00:56:24,489 --> 00:56:26,489
Like, you know, you don't have to if you don't want to.

522
00:56:26,489 --> 00:56:27,489
But can you buy from me, please?

523
00:56:27,489 --> 00:56:43,059
Good night.

524
00:56:43,059 --> 00:56:49,809
Exceeded expectations.

525
00:56:49,809 --> 00:56:51,809
Okay, we got we have plenty of time.

526
00:56:51,809 --> 00:56:53,809
I'm what about fifty five thousand?

527
00:56:53,809 --> 00:56:56,820
Long swords has increased.

528
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:57,820
Damn it.

529
00:56:57,820 --> 00:57:08,860
Speaking of like our like alignment here, we are up in light and plain.

530
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:09,860
Centrist.

531
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:16,420
All right.

532
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:17,420
No support.

533
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:22,880
What?

534
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:25,880
Where was Benjamin Franklin on like the political alignment chart?

535
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:30,550
That's where I want to be.

536
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:45,659
He was a chaotic neutral.

537
00:57:45,659 --> 00:57:59,349
Franklin was chaotic.

538
00:57:59,349 --> 00:58:00,349
Good.

539
00:58:00,349 --> 00:58:01,349
It's important.

540
00:58:01,349 --> 00:58:06,750
Let me see this.

541
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:07,750
What's my alignment?

542
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:26,699
Ah, good try.

543
00:58:26,699 --> 00:58:31,059
I was about to be like, well, you know, if I were for me.

544
00:58:31,059 --> 00:58:33,059
Oh, good try.

545
00:58:33,059 --> 00:58:34,059
You almost had it.

546
00:58:34,059 --> 00:58:35,059
Almost.

547
00:58:35,059 --> 00:58:42,750
It was close.

548
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:52,409
And by the way, I just want to make sure I go like this because somebody will like clip

549
00:58:52,409 --> 00:58:55,409
like a frame and be like, oh, when he said that, he froze like right here.

550
00:58:55,409 --> 00:58:59,099
You don't fucking have any idea what the fuck I am.

551
00:58:59,099 --> 00:59:01,489
I'm sorry.

552
00:59:01,489 --> 00:59:02,489
I'm a wreck.

553
00:59:02,489 --> 00:59:03,489
I'm uncontrollable.

554
00:59:03,489 --> 00:59:05,489
You have no idea where I could end up.

555
00:59:05,489 --> 00:59:11,059
I'm just going to X.

556
00:59:11,059 --> 00:59:13,059
It's so bad.

557
00:59:13,059 --> 00:59:15,059
That would have been so bad.

558
00:59:15,059 --> 00:59:19,130
I haven't saved it.

559
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:37,460
You don't know what I am.

560
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:38,460
You don't know what I am.

561
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:39,460
You don't know what I am.

562
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:40,460
OK.

563
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:42,780
Yeah.

564
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:43,780
Oh, no.

565
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:44,780
Tell me.

566
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:46,280
Yeah.

567
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:47,280
You tell me.

568
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,650
You don't have a discipline.

569
00:59:48,650 --> 00:59:49,650
I'm a disciplined emotional.

570
00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:50,650
That is what I am.

571
00:59:50,650 --> 00:59:51,650
We've already that we came to the term determination of that long time ago.

572
00:59:51,650 --> 00:59:58,969
All right.

573
00:59:58,969 --> 00:59:59,969
Let's go.

574
00:59:59,969 --> 01:00:03,380
I want to go level up.

575
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:04,380
I got plenty of time.

576
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:05,380
Actually, no, I don't.

577
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:13,469
Oh, they're closed today.

578
01:00:13,469 --> 01:00:17,480
How could you be closed today?

579
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:25,590
I got to make some big sales.

580
01:00:25,590 --> 01:00:27,590
I have a couple of big things coming up today.

581
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:30,820
Right.

582
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:31,820
Two scarves and two food stuffs.

583
01:00:31,820 --> 01:00:32,820
Both today.

584
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:35,210
I got both of those things.

585
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:36,210
Let me just load it up.

586
01:00:36,210 --> 01:00:37,210
I got to go.

587
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:38,210
Hold on.

588
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:39,210
I got to buy some stuff.

589
01:00:39,210 --> 01:00:40,210
First of all, let's do the event.

590
01:00:40,210 --> 01:00:43,300
Where is she?

591
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:44,300
There she is.

592
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:45,300
There she is.

593
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:48,719
There she is.

594
01:00:48,719 --> 01:00:49,719
Miss receipt.

595
01:00:49,719 --> 01:00:51,019
Oh, hi there.

596
01:00:51,019 --> 01:00:52,019
So I want to thank you.

597
01:00:52,019 --> 01:00:54,420
Miss receipt.

598
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:55,420
Thank me for what?

599
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:56,659
You helped me with my doll and found my hairpin.

600
01:00:56,659 --> 01:00:57,659
Remember?

601
01:00:57,659 --> 01:00:58,900
Oh, no, no, no.

602
01:00:58,900 --> 01:00:59,900
OK.

603
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:00,900
No.

604
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:01,900
Thanks.

605
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:02,900
Necessary.

606
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:03,900
Right.

607
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:04,900
You seem rather pleased with yourself.

608
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:05,900
Regardless.

609
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:07,199
Is it showing?

610
01:01:08,199 --> 01:01:09,199
OK.

611
01:01:09,199 --> 01:01:10,199
Then I'm going to start.

612
01:01:10,199 --> 01:01:11,199
Don't move.

613
01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:12,199
OK?

614
01:01:12,199 --> 01:01:13,199
Start what?

615
01:01:13,199 --> 01:01:14,199
I'm going to draw a portrait of you.

616
01:01:14,199 --> 01:01:15,699
Of course.

617
01:01:15,699 --> 01:01:18,920
Now don't move.

618
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:19,920
Just a couple of quick questions.

619
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:23,349
Where do you sit on the political alignment chart?

620
01:01:23,349 --> 01:01:24,349
Well, I sit...

621
01:01:24,349 --> 01:01:25,349
Oh.

622
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:26,349
Almost.

623
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:27,349
Can I move yet?

624
01:01:27,349 --> 01:01:28,349
Not yet.

625
01:01:28,349 --> 01:01:34,650
Give me just a few more minutes.

626
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:35,650
OK.

627
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:37,019
Really?

628
01:01:37,019 --> 01:01:38,019
Can I move yet?

629
01:01:38,019 --> 01:01:49,579
She's definitely going like this with her teeth clenched.

630
01:01:49,579 --> 01:01:50,579
OK.

631
01:01:50,579 --> 01:01:51,579
Really?

632
01:01:51,579 --> 01:01:52,579
Can I move yet?

633
01:01:52,579 --> 01:01:53,579
OK.

634
01:01:53,579 --> 01:01:54,579
Really?

635
01:01:54,579 --> 01:01:55,579
Can I move yet?

636
01:01:55,579 --> 01:02:02,320
Just a little bit more.

637
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:03,320
And...

638
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:05,519
Done.

639
01:02:05,519 --> 01:02:06,519
Phew.

640
01:02:06,519 --> 01:02:07,519
Being a model is hard.

641
01:02:07,519 --> 01:02:09,519
My legs feel like tent poles.

642
01:02:09,519 --> 01:02:10,519
So let's see it.

643
01:02:10,519 --> 01:02:11,519
Come on.

644
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:12,519
Here you go.

645
01:02:12,519 --> 01:02:16,130
This is me.

646
01:02:16,130 --> 01:02:18,130
I didn't think my nose.

647
01:02:18,130 --> 01:02:19,130
Huh.

648
01:02:19,130 --> 01:02:21,130
Oh, where am I in this picture?

649
01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:24,389
Oh, you're right here, Ms. Fairy.

650
01:02:24,389 --> 01:02:26,460
But that is...

651
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:28,460
Is that not a dragonfly?

652
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:30,789
Hee-hee.

653
01:02:30,789 --> 01:02:31,789
You're really good.

654
01:02:31,789 --> 01:02:32,789
Hee-hee-hee.

655
01:02:32,789 --> 01:02:33,789
Hee-hee-hee.

656
01:02:33,789 --> 01:02:35,099
That was an ee-hee.

657
01:02:35,099 --> 01:02:37,269
I haven't seen that in a long time.

658
01:02:37,269 --> 01:02:39,280
I really think...

659
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:40,280
I really like this.

660
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:41,519
Thank you.

661
01:02:41,519 --> 01:02:42,519
Thanks, Mr. Reset.

662
01:02:42,519 --> 01:02:43,889
Bye-bye.

663
01:02:43,889 --> 01:02:49,750
Do I really look that much like a dragonfly?

664
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:50,750
Oh.

665
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:52,750
I can't believe it.

666
01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:54,250
OK.

667
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:55,250
Let's go.

668
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:56,250
I want to buy some shit.

669
01:02:56,250 --> 01:03:00,880
I need to sell this.

670
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,880
I have to start making money.

671
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:06,079
I'm going to buy parade armor.

672
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:11,780
And let's get the spiked armband.

673
01:03:11,780 --> 01:03:15,699
Popular.

674
01:03:15,699 --> 01:03:16,699
Let's get some charms.

675
01:03:16,699 --> 01:03:17,699
No, no.

676
01:03:17,699 --> 01:03:18,699
These things suck.

677
01:03:18,699 --> 01:03:22,380
Composite bow.

678
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:25,090
Practice lands.

679
01:03:25,090 --> 01:03:28,090
I need high-paying items.

680
01:03:28,090 --> 01:03:46,860
I...

681
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:50,090
I can do that.

682
01:03:50,090 --> 01:03:51,090
I need to get into that dungeon.

683
01:03:51,090 --> 01:03:52,710
All right.

684
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:54,710
No matter what, tomorrow I'm getting a dungeon.

685
01:03:54,710 --> 01:03:59,170
Let's get these products up here.

686
01:03:59,170 --> 01:04:01,170
I need to make money.

687
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:02,170
Forty-two hundred.

688
01:04:02,170 --> 01:04:03,170
That's worth so much.

689
01:04:03,170 --> 01:04:05,170
I just have to keep doing that.

690
01:04:05,170 --> 01:04:10,030
Foodstuff is today.

691
01:04:10,030 --> 01:04:11,030
All right.

692
01:04:11,030 --> 01:04:12,030
All right.

693
01:04:12,030 --> 01:04:13,030
OK.

694
01:04:13,030 --> 01:04:14,030
All right.

695
01:04:14,030 --> 01:04:20,969
Open the damn store.

696
01:04:20,969 --> 01:04:23,340
And came by to sell this.

697
01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:27,019
There's something I've noticed about the citizens in this game.

698
01:04:27,019 --> 01:04:34,710
All they have, they just come in with random food they find in their house on the ground.

699
01:04:34,710 --> 01:04:37,949
Nobody ever comes in here with a necklace that's worth any money.

700
01:04:37,949 --> 01:04:41,949
They just come in with fucking yams and apples and bread.

701
01:04:41,949 --> 01:04:45,090
I would be more inclined to be happy about this if they was...

702
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:46,090
Hey, I found this.

703
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:49,090
Oh, I was in my grandmother's closet today.

704
01:04:49,090 --> 01:04:53,090
And after she died and we found some parade armor.

705
01:04:53,090 --> 01:04:55,030
I would buy that.

706
01:04:55,030 --> 01:04:58,030
I'd be happy to do a decent price.

707
01:04:58,030 --> 01:05:00,809
OK.

708
01:05:00,809 --> 01:05:01,809
Well, that's a...

709
01:05:01,809 --> 01:05:06,079
Let's do forty-seven hundred.

710
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:07,079
These guys just...

711
01:05:07,079 --> 01:05:10,079
I'm having a collection of expensive items.

712
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:17,420
I do have the foodstuff that you asked for.

713
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:21,099
Just stay right there, sir.

714
01:05:21,099 --> 01:05:23,860
I got baked E.M.

715
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:25,860
And...

716
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:26,860
Fish.

717
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:34,150
Let's do one twenty.

718
01:05:34,150 --> 01:05:43,199
Thank you.

719
01:05:43,199 --> 01:05:44,199
Somebody buy the parade armor.

720
01:05:44,199 --> 01:05:46,199
Oh, here comes the rich girl.

721
01:05:46,199 --> 01:05:49,019
Oh, the scarves, right.

722
01:05:49,019 --> 01:05:54,050
Three thousand and fifty.

723
01:05:54,050 --> 01:05:59,940
Overcharge.

724
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:02,239
Let's do one forty...

725
01:06:02,239 --> 01:06:03,239
Forty-five hundred?

726
01:06:03,239 --> 01:06:05,239
That's a hundred and forty-seven percent.

727
01:06:05,239 --> 01:06:11,179
Forty-six?

728
01:06:11,179 --> 01:06:13,179
Do two hundred percent.

729
01:06:13,179 --> 01:06:14,179
Really?

730
01:06:14,179 --> 01:06:15,179
I don't know if that's gonna happen.

731
01:06:15,179 --> 01:06:18,699
That's ridiculous.

732
01:06:18,699 --> 01:06:19,699
She's not...

733
01:06:19,699 --> 01:06:20,699
She's gonna walk out.

734
01:06:20,699 --> 01:06:31,820
I'm gonna say forty-six hundred.

735
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:32,820
She didn't like that.

736
01:06:32,820 --> 01:06:34,820
She hated that, by the way.

737
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:36,820
You guys want me to start at two hundred percent?

738
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:38,820
She hated that.

739
01:06:38,820 --> 01:06:40,820
I have to do like forty-two hundred now.

740
01:06:40,820 --> 01:06:47,980
I have to sell it.

741
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:54,829
I'm up against the clock.

742
01:06:54,829 --> 01:06:55,829
Somebody buy the parade armor.

743
01:06:55,829 --> 01:06:58,780
I'd like some food.

744
01:06:58,780 --> 01:07:10,829
Fuck.

745
01:07:10,829 --> 01:07:14,860
Oh, come on, man.

746
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:16,860
Did you spend all your money?

747
01:07:16,860 --> 01:07:18,860
What did you spend your money on?

748
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:28,679
Somebody buy the parade armor.

749
01:07:28,679 --> 01:07:32,300
Help a poor lost Burke find a weapon.

750
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:33,300
I can do that.

751
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:36,739
And it's gonna be really expensive.

752
01:07:36,739 --> 01:07:54,230
Ah!

753
01:07:54,230 --> 01:08:13,289
Fuck you!

754
01:08:13,289 --> 01:08:14,289
That wasn't even fucking...

755
01:08:14,289 --> 01:08:15,289
Come on!

756
01:08:15,289 --> 01:08:19,409
Are you serious?

757
01:08:19,409 --> 01:08:25,130
That was so...

758
01:08:25,130 --> 01:08:28,130
That was reasonable for a high-demand item.

759
01:08:28,130 --> 01:08:41,890
Curse at your customers?

760
01:08:41,890 --> 01:08:43,130
Why not?

761
01:08:43,130 --> 01:08:50,939
I'm up against the clock again.

762
01:08:50,939 --> 01:08:52,939
It's happening again.

763
01:08:52,939 --> 01:09:06,659
Let's go to the pub.

764
01:09:06,659 --> 01:09:12,289
Oh, charm hello again.

765
01:09:12,289 --> 01:09:13,289
Here we go again.

766
01:09:13,289 --> 01:09:14,289
Oh, hello.

767
01:09:14,289 --> 01:09:16,289
Hello, receipt.

768
01:09:19,189 --> 01:09:21,619
Tears here, too.

769
01:09:21,619 --> 01:09:24,619
Well, you have my deepest apologies for my continued existence.

770
01:09:24,619 --> 01:09:28,619
Oh, I can't take receipt home with me if you're here.

771
01:09:28,619 --> 01:09:33,829
What?

772
01:09:45,949 --> 01:09:47,949
I cannot let you do anything of that.

773
01:09:47,949 --> 01:09:48,949
So I'm kidding.

774
01:09:48,949 --> 01:09:49,949
Yeesh.

775
01:09:49,949 --> 01:09:51,949
Guys, this is serious.

776
01:09:51,949 --> 01:09:53,949
Somebody call the police.

777
01:09:53,949 --> 01:10:04,689
Especially when you...

778
01:10:05,689 --> 01:10:09,210
I kind of wish I didn't go into the fucking pub

779
01:10:09,210 --> 01:10:11,210
because with that, I don't...

780
01:10:11,210 --> 01:10:23,329
Okay.

781
01:10:23,329 --> 01:10:27,319
Well, first of all, let's go back to the store.

782
01:10:27,319 --> 01:10:34,420
I'm just gonna sell what I have

783
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:35,420
and hopefully somebody buys it.

784
01:10:35,420 --> 01:10:37,420
And then tomorrow we go...

785
01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:39,979
to you-know-where.

786
01:10:39,979 --> 01:10:44,229
Murph!

787
01:10:44,229 --> 01:10:46,920
Oh, shit.

788
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:49,289
Have you completed my order yet?

789
01:10:49,289 --> 01:10:51,590
Well, no, no, I don't have it.

790
01:10:51,590 --> 01:10:53,590
I don't have it, I don't have it, I don't have it.

791
01:10:53,590 --> 01:10:56,560
Well, nothing for it.

792
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:59,560
And to be fair, some of those items are a bear.

793
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:02,560
The slime livers from normal slimes are too small for starters.

794
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:05,560
I need something from one that's bigger.

795
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:08,560
Batwing shouldn't be too hard if you've hunt the eyeball bats, though.

796
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:12,560
I've also heard that it knows a giant meister found of charred lizards.

797
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,560
All right, I did this already.

798
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:15,560
Get out of here.

799
01:11:16,930 --> 01:11:18,359
There it is.

800
01:11:18,359 --> 01:11:20,109
There it is.

801
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:22,109
All right, here we go.

802
01:11:22,109 --> 01:11:24,949
I'm gonna say...

803
01:11:24,949 --> 01:11:25,949
Let's do 68.

804
01:11:30,329 --> 01:11:33,140
65, come on.

805
01:11:33,140 --> 01:11:35,140
All right, 62.

806
01:11:35,140 --> 01:11:45,789
And then there's a bow.

807
01:11:46,789 --> 01:11:49,819
35.

808
01:11:49,819 --> 01:11:50,819
A bow.

809
01:11:52,130 --> 01:11:56,500
I need a hundred and fucking 30,000 more dollars.

810
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:58,500
I gotta get into that new dungeon.

811
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:03,680
No, I don't...

812
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:08,699
I guess a 24.

813
01:12:09,939 --> 01:12:10,939
25.

814
01:12:10,939 --> 01:12:17,779
The dungeon's gonna save me, isn't it?

815
01:12:17,779 --> 01:12:23,119
Hey.

816
01:12:23,119 --> 01:12:24,119
Hey, it's me again.

817
01:12:24,119 --> 01:12:29,119
I decided to come by and sell you another yam that I come by and try to sell you every day.

818
01:12:29,119 --> 01:12:57,939
Candy apples.

819
01:12:58,939 --> 01:12:59,939
I love candy apples.

820
01:12:59,939 --> 01:13:01,939
All right, time for the dungeon.

821
01:13:06,260 --> 01:13:08,260
That's $17,000 a day.

822
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:12,560
All right, here we go.

823
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:15,560
The price of metal items has increased.

824
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:18,560
The price of daggers has normalized.

825
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:23,100
Do I have anything like that?

826
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:24,920
No.

827
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:25,920
All right.

828
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:26,920
Let's...

829
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:27,920
I need to go into the new dungeon.

830
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:28,920
We gotta get some new stuff.

831
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:37,470
So by tomorrow, I need two food stuffs.

832
01:13:37,470 --> 01:13:39,100
I gotta...

833
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:40,100
Fuck.

834
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:54,670
I need a big item.

835
01:13:54,670 --> 01:13:56,670
All right, we got a level eight.

836
01:13:56,670 --> 01:13:59,909
I'm gonna stay with tried and true here.

837
01:13:59,909 --> 01:14:00,909
We're going with Louis.

838
01:14:00,909 --> 01:14:07,949
Let's get a couple of pieces of bread.

839
01:14:07,949 --> 01:14:15,909
This is uncharted territory here.

840
01:14:15,909 --> 01:14:16,909
Here we go.

841
01:14:16,909 --> 01:14:17,909
Amber Garden.

842
01:14:17,909 --> 01:14:21,649
You want...

843
01:14:21,649 --> 01:14:22,649
We demand charm.

844
01:14:22,649 --> 01:14:25,649
Not when I need $140,000.

845
01:14:25,649 --> 01:14:31,149
Take charm.

846
01:14:31,149 --> 01:14:32,649
I need...

847
01:14:32,649 --> 01:14:33,649
She's level eight.

848
01:14:33,649 --> 01:14:35,649
She's got a rusty dagger.

849
01:14:35,649 --> 01:14:47,869
Buy a better one.

850
01:14:47,869 --> 01:14:55,640
No.

851
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:56,640
Will she use...

852
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:59,260
This is gonna be a mistake, ain't it?

853
01:14:59,260 --> 01:15:04,649
No.

854
01:15:04,649 --> 01:15:05,649
I'm sorry, guys.

855
01:15:05,649 --> 01:15:14,819
I'm taking Louis.

856
01:15:14,819 --> 01:15:19,779
No.

857
01:15:19,779 --> 01:15:25,779
I will take charm when it's not absolutely necessary that I have to clear this.

858
01:15:25,779 --> 01:15:26,779
I don't...

859
01:15:26,779 --> 01:15:33,420
I don't even know what...

860
01:15:33,420 --> 01:15:34,420
Okay, I need these guys.

861
01:15:34,420 --> 01:15:39,729
By the way, she said, are you okay?

862
01:15:39,729 --> 01:15:54,819
I can speak Japanese.

863
01:15:54,819 --> 01:15:57,989
You learned that yesterday.

864
01:15:57,989 --> 01:15:58,989
So?

865
01:15:58,989 --> 01:16:09,529
If I learned a language yesterday, would that be a problem?

866
01:16:09,529 --> 01:16:10,899
What is that?

867
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:13,840
That's like a new enemy.

868
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:15,210
Ow.

869
01:16:15,210 --> 01:16:16,210
Ooh, hat.

870
01:16:16,210 --> 01:16:20,260
It's a cloth hat.

871
01:16:20,260 --> 01:16:21,260
Come on.

872
01:16:21,260 --> 01:16:29,939
Oh, some kind of new enemy.

873
01:16:29,939 --> 01:16:30,939
Ow.

874
01:16:30,939 --> 01:16:36,739
Fun fact, the items in the dungeon suck.

875
01:16:36,739 --> 01:16:42,560
But I need to get the materials to be able to make cool items.

876
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:43,560
These guys are supposed to drop them.

877
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:51,710
Those are the gnolls, right?

878
01:16:51,710 --> 01:17:07,979
Nothing over there?

879
01:17:07,979 --> 01:17:09,979
Same old enemies in new dungeon.

880
01:17:09,979 --> 01:17:15,539
B, W, L.

881
01:17:15,539 --> 01:17:16,539
Shit.

882
01:17:16,539 --> 01:17:20,300
Are you alright?

883
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:23,060
What does that mean?

884
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:25,060
That means, are you...

885
01:17:25,060 --> 01:17:27,060
Are you good?

886
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:28,060
Is are you alright?

887
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:29,060
And then she goes, are you good?

888
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:34,710
Are you hurt?

889
01:17:34,710 --> 01:17:35,710
Nice battling.

890
01:17:35,710 --> 01:17:43,560
I think I have as many of those as I need.

891
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:48,640
Wait.

892
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:49,640
Say W again.

893
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:51,140
That's really nice.

894
01:17:51,140 --> 01:17:56,470
W.

895
01:17:56,470 --> 01:18:01,899
Watch out for the hand.

896
01:18:01,899 --> 01:18:04,899
Ooh, what's that, gunpowder?

897
01:18:04,899 --> 01:18:09,859
I probably can use that in something.

898
01:18:09,859 --> 01:18:10,859
New item.

899
01:18:10,859 --> 01:18:21,619
Is the next room going to be in JST instead of PST?

900
01:18:21,619 --> 01:18:26,180
Oh, is that supposed to be Japanese Standard Time?

901
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:29,000
Is that what it's actually called?

902
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:33,390
It's not Japanese Standard Time, is it?

903
01:18:33,390 --> 01:18:50,100
Movement speed increased for everyone.

904
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:52,420
What?

905
01:18:52,420 --> 01:18:56,369
I actually, can I keep this on permanently?

906
01:18:56,369 --> 01:19:00,699
Hey, I want this on forever.

907
01:19:00,699 --> 01:19:01,699
That's not a detriment to what I'm doing.

908
01:19:01,699 --> 01:19:07,300
That's a positive.

909
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:17,340
I definitely have five bad ones.

910
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:25,199
Mystery item.

911
01:19:25,199 --> 01:19:27,199
Come here.

912
01:19:27,199 --> 01:19:31,279
No, I'm not alright.

913
01:19:31,279 --> 01:19:42,460
I just had a bomb explode in my face.

914
01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:46,420
These, they drop the bread.

915
01:19:46,420 --> 01:19:47,420
I don't even want it.

916
01:19:47,420 --> 01:19:52,420
Yeah, I'm just going to eat it right now.

917
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:53,420
Say, what's that one?

918
01:19:53,420 --> 01:19:55,420
Daijou B.

919
01:19:55,420 --> 01:19:56,420
What's B?

920
01:19:56,420 --> 01:19:59,560
Are you alright?

921
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:12,060
Ooh, an apple.

922
01:20:12,060 --> 01:20:15,430
First time I've seen that.

923
01:20:15,430 --> 01:20:18,659
It's an accent.

924
01:20:18,659 --> 01:20:20,659
Oh, okay.

925
01:20:20,659 --> 01:20:21,659
Hey, that's good to know.

926
01:20:21,659 --> 01:20:26,460
Alright, cool.

927
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:34,670
Hitchy eye, hold on.

928
01:20:34,670 --> 01:20:40,350
Shit.

929
01:20:40,350 --> 01:20:43,869
Toothpicks?

930
01:20:43,869 --> 01:20:49,079
What the fuck am I going to do with these?

931
01:20:49,079 --> 01:20:59,810
One last spot I didn't see down here.

932
01:20:59,810 --> 01:21:02,300
Something good.

933
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:03,300
That's wood.

934
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:07,819
That's wood.

935
01:21:07,819 --> 01:21:09,819
Get those George Washington teeth out of here.

936
01:21:09,819 --> 01:21:15,939
I don't even want them.

937
01:21:15,939 --> 01:21:26,850
What are we on?

938
01:21:26,850 --> 01:21:32,060
Second floor Amber Garden?

939
01:21:32,060 --> 01:21:37,180
We could just skip to the latino.

940
01:21:37,180 --> 01:21:44,710
And then I have to do the slime thing.

941
01:21:44,710 --> 01:21:46,710
Is that going to waste so much time?

942
01:21:46,710 --> 01:21:48,710
I can't even get that guy's order.

943
01:21:48,710 --> 01:21:50,710
It's going to be so...

944
01:21:50,710 --> 01:22:05,560
It's going to take forever.

945
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:11,449
Forget about the slime liver.

946
01:22:11,449 --> 01:22:17,100
Like, I need it though.

947
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:18,100
I'm going to do some fusion.

948
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:19,100
I'm going to do some fusion.

949
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:22,850
I'm going to make some money.

950
01:22:22,850 --> 01:22:24,090
How much?

951
01:22:24,090 --> 01:22:25,090
I have 70,000.

952
01:22:25,090 --> 01:22:27,460
I need 200.

953
01:22:27,460 --> 01:22:33,399
I don't think it will take too long.

954
01:22:33,399 --> 01:22:42,739
Let's get rid of the bread.

955
01:22:42,739 --> 01:22:43,739
Bread is worthless.

956
01:22:43,739 --> 01:22:45,239
Alright, here we go.

957
01:22:45,239 --> 01:22:49,500
Did these guys drop new stuff?

958
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:50,500
Gunpowder.

959
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:51,810
Dammit.

960
01:22:51,810 --> 01:23:02,859
I don't think the null has dropped.

961
01:23:02,859 --> 01:23:05,859
One of the items that I need from the null.

962
01:23:05,859 --> 01:23:08,859
Has it?

963
01:23:08,859 --> 01:23:19,050
All they drop is chestnuts.

964
01:23:19,050 --> 01:23:26,199
Magical Staff?

965
01:23:26,199 --> 01:23:27,199
It's the charred lizard.

966
01:23:27,199 --> 01:23:28,199
I only have one.

967
01:23:28,199 --> 01:23:37,060
Watch out.

968
01:23:37,060 --> 01:23:49,770
He's going to explode.

969
01:23:49,770 --> 01:23:53,760
Don't blow up.

970
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:54,760
Don't blow up.

971
01:23:54,760 --> 01:24:05,170
These levels are bigger.

972
01:24:05,170 --> 01:24:06,170
One chain.

973
01:24:06,170 --> 01:24:12,170
So, somebody was saying, if I kill the same enemy in a row, just ignore everything else

974
01:24:12,170 --> 01:24:15,170
and just kill the enemy that I need to kill, there's a higher chance that it will drop

975
01:24:15,170 --> 01:24:17,979
the thing that I want it to drop?

976
01:24:17,979 --> 01:24:20,979
So, just run around and only kill the nulls.

977
01:24:20,979 --> 01:24:22,979
Well, except.

978
01:24:22,979 --> 01:24:23,979
Apparently.

979
01:24:23,979 --> 01:24:24,979
So it seems.

980
01:24:24,979 --> 01:24:25,979
Huh.

981
01:24:25,979 --> 01:24:31,260
Alright.

982
01:24:31,260 --> 01:24:37,359
News.

983
01:24:37,359 --> 01:24:39,359
Adventurer attack power doubled.

984
01:24:39,359 --> 01:24:44,649
Well, that's pretty convenient.

985
01:24:44,649 --> 01:24:49,000
Maybe I shouldn't leave.

986
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,000
What's that?

987
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Rusty?

988
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Okay.

989
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,619
Inkwell.

990
01:24:53,619 --> 01:24:58,619
That's a part of a recipe.

991
01:24:58,619 --> 01:25:02,569
Don't ever leave.

992
01:25:02,569 --> 01:25:03,569
Yeah.

993
01:25:03,569 --> 01:25:06,810
I'm just going to keep going down.

994
01:25:06,810 --> 01:25:15,680
Why would I leave?

995
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:18,560
That felt pretty good.

996
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:19,560
Watch this.

997
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:20,560
Ready?

998
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:21,989
Three, four.

999
01:25:21,989 --> 01:25:24,770
Two chain.

1000
01:25:24,770 --> 01:25:30,529
I can see the shadows.

1001
01:25:30,529 --> 01:25:31,529
Ow.

1002
01:25:31,529 --> 01:25:32,899
No.

1003
01:25:32,899 --> 01:25:33,899
Don't.

1004
01:25:33,899 --> 01:25:34,899
Come on.

1005
01:25:34,899 --> 01:25:35,899
What's that?

1006
01:25:35,899 --> 01:25:36,899
A jacket?

1007
01:25:36,899 --> 01:25:37,899
I love a windbreaker.

1008
01:25:37,899 --> 01:25:41,329
The windbreaker is stupid.

1009
01:25:41,329 --> 01:25:42,329
Everything's stupid.

1010
01:25:42,329 --> 01:25:43,329
You're stupid.

1011
01:25:43,329 --> 01:25:45,399
I'm not stupid.

1012
01:25:45,399 --> 01:25:46,399
This is level 18.

1013
01:25:46,399 --> 01:25:56,659
Ah.

1014
01:25:56,659 --> 01:25:57,659
Honey.

1015
01:25:57,659 --> 01:26:02,250
I think I need three honeys, right?

1016
01:26:02,250 --> 01:26:22,439
This is where it gets fucked up.

1017
01:26:22,439 --> 01:26:23,439
Alright.

1018
01:26:23,439 --> 01:26:24,439
I need three honeys.

1019
01:26:24,439 --> 01:26:30,609
Let's eat the cherry.

1020
01:26:30,609 --> 01:26:34,229
I'm almost going to have enough to make a bunch of stuff.

1021
01:26:34,229 --> 01:26:36,819
Snow.

1022
01:26:36,819 --> 01:26:38,500
Come on.

1023
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:48,140
This is the cherry, but I need a big of bags.

1024
01:26:48,140 --> 01:27:02,020
I can just get rid of the bread.

1025
01:27:02,020 --> 01:27:06,020
I'm at that point where I have to start eliminating the least expensive thing here.

1026
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:12,720
God damn it.

1027
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:14,720
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

1028
01:27:14,720 --> 01:27:15,720
It's a bad thing.

1029
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:22,500
Does the candy restore its SP?

1030
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:40,140
I'm curious to see how close I am to two or three cubes.

1031
01:27:40,140 --> 01:27:43,140
I'm going to miss this double damage when it's gone on the next floor.

1032
01:27:43,140 --> 01:27:46,380
It even does lead.

1033
01:27:46,380 --> 01:27:53,920
Can I dash by double tapping?

1034
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:54,920
No.

1035
01:27:54,920 --> 01:28:00,250
You're on a fixed speed.

1036
01:28:00,250 --> 01:28:01,869
Chest.

1037
01:28:01,869 --> 01:28:02,869
Whoa.

1038
01:28:02,869 --> 01:28:03,869
Gunpowder.

1039
01:28:03,869 --> 01:28:04,869
Good.

1040
01:28:04,869 --> 01:28:09,689
Can you make a gun or explosives or something?

1041
01:28:09,689 --> 01:28:19,060
I'm almost level 19, so I'm going to get, mm, 1200.

1042
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:20,060
That's pretty good.

1043
01:28:20,060 --> 01:28:23,489
This thing's a piece of crap, but I can sell it for something stupid.

1044
01:28:23,489 --> 01:28:24,489
How much is the windbreaker?

1045
01:28:24,489 --> 01:28:25,489
500.

1046
01:28:25,489 --> 01:28:32,619
Let's get rid of the chest nut.

1047
01:28:32,619 --> 01:28:38,659
What is this game?

1048
01:28:38,659 --> 01:28:48,319
This is called Risseteer and Item Shops Tale.

1049
01:28:48,319 --> 01:28:50,319
I could be saying that wrong.

1050
01:28:50,319 --> 01:28:55,319
I've probably been risk pronouncing this the whole entire game, so it wouldn't surprise me.

1051
01:28:55,319 --> 01:28:59,029
Is it on sale for $5?

1052
01:28:59,029 --> 01:29:01,460
I'll go get it.

1053
01:29:01,460 --> 01:29:02,460
This is what, is it $4.99?

1054
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:03,460
Just go buy it.

1055
01:29:03,460 --> 01:29:12,140
Why would you not?

1056
01:29:12,140 --> 01:29:22,699
I mean, you have to gauge.

1057
01:29:22,699 --> 01:29:23,699
All right.

1058
01:29:23,699 --> 01:29:24,699
What is the boss?

1059
01:29:24,699 --> 01:29:28,699
Sometimes you have to gauge the value of something based on if it's more money for you to go

1060
01:29:28,699 --> 01:29:31,699
get like a double cheeseburger from McDonald's.

1061
01:29:31,699 --> 01:29:32,699
Oh, shit.

1062
01:29:32,699 --> 01:29:40,189
This guy's kind of.

1063
01:29:40,189 --> 01:29:42,840
Uh-oh.

1064
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:43,840
Uh-oh.

1065
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:45,590
Oh, shit.

1066
01:29:45,590 --> 01:30:07,670
I got to eat food and eat the apple.

1067
01:30:07,670 --> 01:30:12,380
Don't do it.

1068
01:30:12,380 --> 01:30:16,310
Shit.

1069
01:30:16,310 --> 01:30:17,310
Shit.

1070
01:30:17,310 --> 01:30:18,680
Shit.

1071
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:19,680
Do I know what can't?

1072
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:20,680
All right.

1073
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:33,819
Calm down.

1074
01:30:33,819 --> 01:30:37,750
Shit.

1075
01:30:37,750 --> 01:30:38,750
Oh, God.

1076
01:30:38,750 --> 01:30:39,750
Oh, God.

1077
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:40,750
Oh, God.

1078
01:30:40,750 --> 01:30:54,470
Oh, God.

1079
01:30:54,470 --> 01:30:59,420
Oh, God.

1080
01:30:59,420 --> 01:31:00,420
Oh, my God.

1081
01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:06,590
Oh, my God.

1082
01:31:06,590 --> 01:31:07,590
Oh, my God.

1083
01:31:07,590 --> 01:31:08,590
Oh, my God.

1084
01:31:08,590 --> 01:31:11,560
Oh, my God.

1085
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:12,560
Oh, my God.

1086
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:13,560
Oh, my God.

1087
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:14,560
I freaked out.

1088
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:15,560
No chest or anything.

1089
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:16,739
Should I just keep going?

1090
01:31:16,739 --> 01:31:17,739
No.

1091
01:31:17,739 --> 01:31:23,899
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1092
01:31:23,899 --> 01:31:24,899
I'm not going.

1093
01:31:24,899 --> 01:31:25,899
I can't.

1094
01:31:25,899 --> 01:31:26,899
I have to sell stuff.

1095
01:31:26,899 --> 01:31:29,550
I need money.

1096
01:31:29,550 --> 01:31:30,550
I'm not going.

1097
01:31:32,180 --> 01:31:33,609
Fusions.

1098
01:31:33,609 --> 01:31:35,210
Rank one staff.

1099
01:31:35,210 --> 01:31:37,890
I need a back scratcher.

1100
01:31:37,890 --> 01:31:38,890
Where the hell can I get a back scratcher?

1101
01:31:38,890 --> 01:31:39,890
Didn't I have one?

1102
01:31:39,890 --> 01:31:47,979
Hat?

1103
01:31:47,979 --> 01:31:50,180
I need some.

1104
01:31:50,180 --> 01:31:52,500
Okay.

1105
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:53,500
Can I craft a back?

1106
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:54,500
Okay.

1107
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:55,500
I can make one.

1108
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:59,619
I can make another one of these.

1109
01:31:59,619 --> 01:32:03,170
Toothpicks.

1110
01:32:03,170 --> 01:32:05,659
This is like $15,000 to $16,000.

1111
01:32:05,659 --> 01:32:11,899
So, but I can't because I need to give that to the dude.

1112
01:32:11,899 --> 01:32:15,829
All right.

1113
01:32:15,829 --> 01:32:17,029
So, I need fur balls.

1114
01:32:17,029 --> 01:32:18,029
I can get the...

1115
01:32:18,029 --> 01:32:19,029
So, can I...

1116
01:32:19,029 --> 01:32:21,779
Can I buy a back scratcher?

1117
01:32:21,819 --> 01:32:26,779
This is probably going to be worth a lot of money.

1118
01:32:26,779 --> 01:32:27,779
Back scratcher.

1119
01:32:27,779 --> 01:32:37,819
Where am I going to get a back scratcher?

1120
01:32:37,819 --> 01:32:51,859
Well, there's the...

1121
01:32:51,859 --> 01:32:54,859
Yeah, I can get this, but I still need the fur.

1122
01:32:54,859 --> 01:32:59,680
So, I can go back and go get like the fur from the first few floors.

1123
01:32:59,680 --> 01:33:03,260
Floors 11 to 15?

1124
01:33:03,260 --> 01:33:05,850
Yeah.

1125
01:33:05,850 --> 01:33:15,020
So, let me get this.

1126
01:33:15,020 --> 01:33:22,020
I need a back scratcher and I need three fur balls.

1127
01:33:22,020 --> 01:33:28,439
All right.

1128
01:33:28,439 --> 01:33:37,739
I can't do this today, but might as well just do this event because it's flashing.

1129
01:33:37,779 --> 01:33:40,489
Fur balls are easy.

1130
01:33:40,489 --> 01:33:44,029
Yeah.

1131
01:33:44,029 --> 01:33:48,029
I heard there's a girl here who's been handing out advice to people lately.

1132
01:33:48,029 --> 01:33:49,029
Advice?

1133
01:33:49,029 --> 01:33:52,029
Well, that would not be very surprising for a fortune teller as such, but here in the

1134
01:33:52,029 --> 01:33:56,029
pub, apparently she can clear up any problem you have in seconds.

1135
01:33:56,029 --> 01:33:57,029
Kind of wonder who it is.

1136
01:33:57,029 --> 01:33:59,619
Oh, it's me.

1137
01:33:59,619 --> 01:34:00,619
Haha.

1138
01:34:00,619 --> 01:34:01,619
I wish I got...

1139
01:34:01,619 --> 01:34:02,619
I wish I got...

1140
01:34:02,619 --> 01:34:03,619
Why this...

1141
01:34:03,619 --> 01:34:04,619
It was happening.

1142
01:34:04,619 --> 01:34:06,369
All right.

1143
01:34:06,369 --> 01:34:07,369
All right.

1144
01:34:07,369 --> 01:34:11,369
Slow down World of Warcraft filter when you take three drinks.

1145
01:34:11,369 --> 01:34:14,399
Oh, excuse me.

1146
01:34:14,399 --> 01:34:15,399
Yeah.

1147
01:34:15,439 --> 01:34:16,439
You have to be...

1148
01:34:16,439 --> 01:34:18,260
Will you hear me out?

1149
01:34:18,260 --> 01:34:19,260
Oh, yes.

1150
01:34:19,260 --> 01:34:20,260
I'll listen.

1151
01:34:20,260 --> 01:34:22,390
Go ahead.

1152
01:34:22,390 --> 01:34:25,430
My wife terrifies me so much at this point that I can't even look at alcohol without

1153
01:34:25,430 --> 01:34:26,430
feeling guilty.

1154
01:34:26,430 --> 01:34:27,989
Help.

1155
01:34:27,989 --> 01:34:28,989
Ah, women are easy to handle.

1156
01:34:28,989 --> 01:34:31,619
I should know, right?

1157
01:34:31,619 --> 01:34:33,819
Just do little things that keep her happy.

1158
01:34:33,819 --> 01:34:34,819
They'll solve your problems.

1159
01:34:34,819 --> 01:34:35,819
Yeah.

1160
01:34:35,819 --> 01:34:36,819
Aha.

1161
01:34:36,819 --> 01:34:37,819
Oh, that makes sense.

1162
01:34:37,819 --> 01:34:38,819
I'll try that out.

1163
01:34:38,819 --> 01:34:42,039
Thanks.

1164
01:34:42,039 --> 01:34:43,039
I mean, a lot of people like that lately.

1165
01:34:43,039 --> 01:34:44,039
Wonder why.

1166
01:34:44,039 --> 01:34:49,609
I didn't lose a slice for that one.

1167
01:34:49,609 --> 01:34:52,260
Did I?

1168
01:34:52,260 --> 01:34:53,260
All right.

1169
01:34:53,260 --> 01:34:54,260
What do I got?

1170
01:34:54,539 --> 01:34:55,539
One fucking 30,000.

1171
01:34:55,539 --> 01:35:10,119
I feel like I still have a lot of stuff on sale.

1172
01:35:10,119 --> 01:35:14,369
Didn't I?

1173
01:35:14,369 --> 01:35:15,369
No.

1174
01:35:15,369 --> 01:35:19,170
Somebody already bought this.

1175
01:35:19,170 --> 01:35:20,170
All right.

1176
01:35:20,170 --> 01:35:24,859
Let's do it.

1177
01:35:24,859 --> 01:35:27,380
Get the sword up there.

1178
01:35:27,380 --> 01:35:28,380
Let's get...

1179
01:35:28,380 --> 01:35:32,119
Oh, I need all this.

1180
01:35:32,119 --> 01:35:33,119
I gotta...

1181
01:35:33,119 --> 01:35:35,340
I have to start to sell these rings.

1182
01:35:35,340 --> 01:35:38,659
The same shit happened last time.

1183
01:35:38,659 --> 01:35:39,979
I have to sell them.

1184
01:35:39,979 --> 01:36:00,579
Oh, I am in a lot of trouble.

1185
01:36:00,579 --> 01:36:01,579
I'm not going to save over that.

1186
01:36:01,579 --> 01:36:02,579
I'm saving down here.

1187
01:36:02,579 --> 01:36:06,859
Just in case there's a disaster.

1188
01:36:06,899 --> 01:36:09,779
I'm gonna...

1189
01:36:09,779 --> 01:36:11,020
I gotta put them out.

1190
01:36:11,020 --> 01:36:29,579
I have to make some money here.

1191
01:36:29,579 --> 01:36:30,579
Don't sell the rings.

1192
01:36:30,579 --> 01:36:31,949
They're not...

1193
01:36:31,949 --> 01:36:35,079
No, they're not half price.

1194
01:36:35,079 --> 01:36:36,079
Sell the honey?

1195
01:36:36,079 --> 01:36:38,449
No, I need the honey for a fusion.

1196
01:36:38,449 --> 01:36:41,609
And then I gotta go back and get fur and then I gotta get a back scratcher.

1197
01:36:41,609 --> 01:36:45,600
They're not...

1198
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:46,600
The half price.

1199
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:52,659
Yeah, but I got them for like 5,000.

1200
01:36:52,659 --> 01:36:53,659
I can only really afford this.

1201
01:36:53,659 --> 01:37:04,960
I can afford to do this for like one more day.

1202
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:08,460
I need the batlings for the fusion.

1203
01:37:08,500 --> 01:37:10,500
I could put like anti-venom out here.

1204
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:16,420
You have to hold and have faith.

1205
01:37:16,420 --> 01:37:18,979
Toothpicks of worth, nothing, gunpowder is part of...

1206
01:37:18,979 --> 01:37:19,979
No, I can't.

1207
01:37:19,979 --> 01:37:20,979
Who's coming in today?

1208
01:37:20,979 --> 01:37:24,060
Anybody coming in at the end of the day?

1209
01:37:24,060 --> 01:37:25,539
Tomorrow, two food steps.

1210
01:37:25,539 --> 01:37:35,300
Okay.

1211
01:37:35,300 --> 01:37:36,300
No, I need all this shit.

1212
01:37:36,300 --> 01:37:43,300
I can put the armband up here.

1213
01:37:43,300 --> 01:37:45,569
Buy more rings?

1214
01:37:45,569 --> 01:37:47,369
Do not give me ideas like that.

1215
01:37:47,369 --> 01:38:08,060
There's a lot of good memories tied to this.

1216
01:38:08,060 --> 01:38:11,739
Is there a way I can put like a sign on the door that says, I don't want your stuff?

1217
01:38:15,380 --> 01:38:19,640
There's a lot of good memories tied to this cherry.

1218
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:20,640
Okay, so...

1219
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:33,500
This sells for 400.

1220
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:38,300
When she died, my grandmother told me to sell this if I ever got into trouble.

1221
01:38:38,300 --> 01:38:50,260
I'm sorry.

1222
01:38:50,260 --> 01:38:51,699
Now I actually am getting scammed.

1223
01:38:51,699 --> 01:38:56,180
There we go.

1224
01:38:56,180 --> 01:38:58,699
140.

1225
01:38:58,699 --> 01:39:00,899
It is that much.

1226
01:39:00,899 --> 01:39:08,699
Once I get these diffusions, I'll have a ton of money.

1227
01:39:08,699 --> 01:39:11,710
All right, I want the windbreaker.

1228
01:39:11,710 --> 01:39:13,720
120.

1229
01:39:13,720 --> 01:39:22,000
I just need the right fusion.

1230
01:39:22,779 --> 01:39:24,579
I really, really need two hats.

1231
01:39:24,579 --> 01:39:25,579
I need them in two days.

1232
01:39:25,579 --> 01:39:31,140
I can do that.

1233
01:39:31,140 --> 01:39:32,140
Accept defeat.

1234
01:39:32,140 --> 01:39:34,470
No, I'm not going to accept defeat.

1235
01:39:34,470 --> 01:39:38,590
I have two or three fusions and those items are going to be worth like 20 to 30 thousand

1236
01:39:38,590 --> 01:39:41,350
dollars each.

1237
01:39:41,350 --> 01:39:42,350
I'm not going to...

1238
01:39:42,350 --> 01:39:47,260
I'll be fine.

1239
01:39:47,260 --> 01:39:49,060
The chilly season is here.

1240
01:39:49,060 --> 01:39:52,420
Those sensitive to cold should bundle up.

1241
01:39:52,420 --> 01:39:54,899
The price of accessories has normalized.

1242
01:39:54,899 --> 01:39:56,500
All right.

1243
01:39:56,500 --> 01:40:00,359
You know what that means, right?

1244
01:40:00,399 --> 01:40:02,560
That means it's time to sell the...

1245
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:04,680
See, they were 50% off.

1246
01:40:04,680 --> 01:40:17,380
Let's get that bracelet up here.

1247
01:40:17,380 --> 01:40:21,760
All right.

1248
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:30,329
Let's get some of these necklaces.

1249
01:40:30,329 --> 01:40:32,130
Make the fusion cape with the inkwell.

1250
01:40:32,130 --> 01:40:36,090
Well, if I do that, then I lose out on this dude's order.

1251
01:40:36,090 --> 01:40:38,529
But all right, I have to adventure.

1252
01:40:38,529 --> 01:40:40,489
Let me see exactly what I need.

1253
01:40:40,489 --> 01:40:53,439
There.

1254
01:40:53,439 --> 01:40:57,800
Just the good shit.

1255
01:40:57,800 --> 01:41:01,619
So I need to do...

1256
01:41:01,619 --> 01:41:04,220
I could just open the store now or should I go...

1257
01:41:04,220 --> 01:41:05,220
Let me see.

1258
01:41:05,220 --> 01:41:07,060
If I lose a slice of time.

1259
01:41:07,060 --> 01:41:11,020
How many days do I have?

1260
01:41:11,020 --> 01:41:15,569
It's like three days.

1261
01:41:15,569 --> 01:41:16,569
I'm going to lose.

1262
01:41:16,569 --> 01:41:29,260
I'm going to lose.

1263
01:41:29,260 --> 01:41:30,260
It's you again.

1264
01:41:30,260 --> 01:41:31,340
I don't have your order.

1265
01:41:31,340 --> 01:41:36,020
I'm sorry.

1266
01:41:36,020 --> 01:41:39,739
Bingo.

1267
01:41:39,739 --> 01:41:43,579
I'm going 3,400.

1268
01:41:43,579 --> 01:41:45,140
Just a little bit less.

1269
01:41:45,140 --> 01:41:46,460
3,300.

1270
01:41:46,460 --> 01:41:53,079
Take it.

1271
01:41:53,079 --> 01:41:54,079
Treasures.

1272
01:41:54,079 --> 01:41:55,079
Buy them.

1273
01:41:55,079 --> 01:41:56,079
Don't want...

1274
01:41:56,079 --> 01:42:00,649
I hope you don't want something in the window.

1275
01:42:00,649 --> 01:42:01,649
Go away.

1276
01:42:01,729 --> 01:42:20,560
I don't want to buy anymore stuff from you.

1277
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:21,560
Please.

1278
01:42:21,560 --> 01:42:22,560
It's 600.

1279
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:23,560
That's it.

1280
01:42:23,560 --> 01:42:24,560
Mommy would get mad.

1281
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:31,579
I've come to get my food stuffs.

1282
01:42:31,579 --> 01:42:34,649
Oh shit.

1283
01:42:34,649 --> 01:42:35,649
I got it.

1284
01:42:35,649 --> 01:42:38,100
Okay.

1285
01:42:38,100 --> 01:42:41,100
Baked yam and a cherry.

1286
01:42:41,100 --> 01:42:50,979
130.

1287
01:42:50,979 --> 01:42:51,979
130%.

1288
01:42:51,979 --> 01:42:55,119
A little bit less.

1289
01:42:55,119 --> 01:42:56,119
One...

1290
01:42:56,119 --> 01:42:57,119
All right.

1291
01:42:57,119 --> 01:43:05,720
3,600.

1292
01:43:05,720 --> 01:43:06,720
Somebody buy the rings.

1293
01:43:06,720 --> 01:43:11,430
What can I get you?

1294
01:43:11,430 --> 01:43:16,430
The adventurer is coming in to get the chocolate.

1295
01:43:16,430 --> 01:43:25,460
I don't know what this guy's deal is.

1296
01:43:25,460 --> 01:43:29,460
Somebody buy a ring.

1297
01:43:29,460 --> 01:43:36,979
I can always rely on you to come in here and just be an absolute moron.

1298
01:43:36,979 --> 01:43:39,619
6,000.

1299
01:43:39,619 --> 01:43:40,619
7,000.

1300
01:43:40,619 --> 01:43:47,939
6,200.

1301
01:43:47,939 --> 01:43:48,939
All right.

1302
01:43:48,939 --> 01:43:56,260
Ah.

1303
01:43:56,260 --> 01:44:02,430
Ah.

1304
01:44:02,430 --> 01:44:03,430
Dammit.

1305
01:44:03,430 --> 01:44:11,569
I'm in a lot of trouble here.

1306
01:44:11,569 --> 01:44:12,569
Okay.

1307
01:44:12,569 --> 01:44:13,569
I can't afford to...

1308
01:44:13,569 --> 01:44:14,770
I have to do the adventuring.

1309
01:44:14,770 --> 01:44:19,539
I need to go find these items.

1310
01:44:19,539 --> 01:44:22,500
So let me see what I gotta do here.

1311
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:26,180
Merchant skill fusion.

1312
01:44:26,180 --> 01:44:27,180
I need...

1313
01:44:27,180 --> 01:44:29,329
What do I need?

1314
01:44:29,329 --> 01:44:34,579
A backscratcher.

1315
01:44:34,579 --> 01:44:35,579
Three fur balls.

1316
01:44:35,579 --> 01:44:36,579
Okay.

1317
01:44:36,579 --> 01:44:37,579
Three fur balls.

1318
01:44:37,579 --> 01:44:41,100
Should I just make this stupid thing?

1319
01:44:41,100 --> 01:44:42,100
And that guy will...

1320
01:44:42,100 --> 01:44:43,100
That guy will forever.

1321
01:44:43,100 --> 01:44:48,489
He's gonna just keep coming to the store.

1322
01:44:48,489 --> 01:44:49,489
I can get another...

1323
01:44:49,489 --> 01:44:50,489
I can get another...

1324
01:44:50,489 --> 01:44:53,329
Was it?

1325
01:44:53,329 --> 01:44:54,329
Just do it.

1326
01:44:54,329 --> 01:44:55,630
Fuck the Redditor.

1327
01:44:55,630 --> 01:45:00,079
What do you mean the Redditor?

1328
01:45:00,079 --> 01:45:01,770
I'm doing it.

1329
01:45:01,770 --> 01:45:02,770
I have to.

1330
01:45:02,770 --> 01:45:03,770
I'm gonna lose.

1331
01:45:03,770 --> 01:45:08,520
I need to make money.

1332
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:11,960
Three fur balls.

1333
01:45:11,960 --> 01:45:12,960
One cloth cape.

1334
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:32,369
Let me get the cloth cape.

1335
01:45:32,369 --> 01:45:33,369
I'm gonna do...

1336
01:45:33,369 --> 01:45:38,609
I'm gonna pull this out of my ass.

1337
01:45:38,609 --> 01:45:45,859
10,000.

1338
01:45:45,859 --> 01:45:47,779
I'm not gonna be able to make this one, unfortunately.

1339
01:45:47,779 --> 01:45:49,560
Not yet.

1340
01:45:49,560 --> 01:45:52,420
But I will be able to do this one.

1341
01:45:52,420 --> 01:45:53,420
Three fur balls.

1342
01:45:53,420 --> 01:45:54,420
Now where am I...

1343
01:45:54,420 --> 01:46:00,510
What's the absolute best way to get those?

1344
01:46:00,510 --> 01:46:04,020
Or one more honey.

1345
01:46:04,020 --> 01:46:05,260
One honey.

1346
01:46:05,260 --> 01:46:07,479
One backscratcher.

1347
01:46:07,479 --> 01:46:12,630
The rabbits.

1348
01:46:12,670 --> 01:46:13,670
Three fur balls.

1349
01:46:13,670 --> 01:46:14,670
One backscratcher.

1350
01:46:14,670 --> 01:46:16,420
One honey.

1351
01:46:16,420 --> 01:46:24,699
I'm going for it.

1352
01:46:24,699 --> 01:46:25,699
Jade Way.

1353
01:46:25,699 --> 01:46:26,699
And it was...

1354
01:46:26,699 --> 01:46:28,199
What?

1355
01:46:28,199 --> 01:46:29,199
Floral, like, 6-10?

1356
01:46:29,199 --> 01:46:30,199
Floral, 11-15?

1357
01:46:30,199 --> 01:46:38,909
The rabbits were in the very beginning, weren't they?

1358
01:46:38,909 --> 01:46:44,890
Just do them all.

1359
01:46:44,890 --> 01:46:46,369
I'm gonna have to do a full tour.

1360
01:46:46,369 --> 01:46:48,949
Yeah.

1361
01:46:48,949 --> 01:46:49,949
I'm going.

1362
01:46:49,949 --> 01:46:51,229
Let's start at the very beginning.

1363
01:46:51,229 --> 01:46:52,229
Welcome to hell.

1364
01:46:52,229 --> 01:47:05,819
I need rabbits.

1365
01:47:05,819 --> 01:47:10,550
Oh, there's this person again.

1366
01:47:10,550 --> 01:47:21,229
Can you accidentally drop 50,000 dollars?

1367
01:47:21,229 --> 01:47:24,010
Hi again.

1368
01:47:24,010 --> 01:47:25,010
Oh my, hello.

1369
01:47:25,010 --> 01:47:26,010
Have we met somewhere?

1370
01:47:26,010 --> 01:47:27,010
Uh, yeah.

1371
01:47:27,449 --> 01:47:30,649
In a way, that's given me a whole lot of deja vu.

1372
01:47:30,649 --> 01:47:31,649
Is that right?

1373
01:47:31,649 --> 01:47:32,649
I'm sorry that I don't remember.

1374
01:47:32,649 --> 01:47:38,340
I take it you are again here by mistake while attempting to get home.

1375
01:47:38,340 --> 01:47:39,340
I'm not quite sure I...

1376
01:47:39,340 --> 01:47:40,340
Wait, am I...

1377
01:47:40,340 --> 01:47:48,409
I'm somewhat not surprised that you did not realize where you were.

1378
01:47:48,409 --> 01:47:50,930
I was just heading home from the market with dinner.

1379
01:47:50,930 --> 01:47:53,939
See, I even have my scallions with me.

1380
01:47:53,939 --> 01:47:56,739
Scallions, I think I could use those.

1381
01:47:56,739 --> 01:47:59,020
Those look great, so perfectly green and tasty.

1382
01:47:59,020 --> 01:48:03,619
Ah, it was quite a good purchase.

1383
01:48:03,619 --> 01:48:05,100
Thank you for buying those for us.

1384
01:48:05,100 --> 01:48:09,460
Wait, I was buying them for you?

1385
01:48:09,460 --> 01:48:10,460
Yes, you were.

1386
01:48:10,460 --> 01:48:11,460
Of course you were.

1387
01:48:11,460 --> 01:48:15,420
I think something more than your sense of direction is off.

1388
01:48:15,420 --> 01:48:18,930
I think I'll have sukiyaki for dinner tonight.

1389
01:48:18,930 --> 01:48:20,550
Sukiyaki?

1390
01:48:20,550 --> 01:48:23,699
I don't know what that is, but it sounds good.

1391
01:48:23,699 --> 01:48:28,460
Can we fix sukiyami for dinner tonight?

1392
01:48:28,460 --> 01:48:29,460
Grain porridge.

1393
01:48:29,460 --> 01:48:30,460
Ever.

1394
01:48:30,460 --> 01:48:31,460
And.

1395
01:48:31,460 --> 01:48:32,460
And on.

1396
01:48:32,460 --> 01:48:33,949
Aww.

1397
01:48:33,949 --> 01:48:35,979
I enjoy your company, you two.

1398
01:48:35,979 --> 01:48:37,180
I must get home, however.

1399
01:48:37,180 --> 01:48:38,180
Stay safe.

1400
01:48:38,180 --> 01:48:46,579
Raincoat.

1401
01:48:47,220 --> 01:48:48,859
I'm not picking up any of this shit.

1402
01:48:48,859 --> 01:48:50,979
I gotta find rabbits and chain them together.

1403
01:48:50,979 --> 01:48:52,500
Alright, where are the rabbits?

1404
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:53,500
Only kill rabbits.

1405
01:48:53,500 --> 01:48:54,500
Rabbit!

1406
01:48:54,500 --> 01:49:02,449
Only kill rabbits.

1407
01:49:02,449 --> 01:49:03,449
More rabbits!

1408
01:49:03,449 --> 01:49:06,350
Where are they?

1409
01:49:06,350 --> 01:49:13,909
I know there's more rabbits.

1410
01:49:13,909 --> 01:49:15,600
Come on.

1411
01:49:15,600 --> 01:49:19,800
If I sell all these items that I make right now, that's like 45-50 thousand dollars.

1412
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:21,939
I'll...

1413
01:49:21,939 --> 01:49:24,340
It'll be close, but I'll get there.

1414
01:49:24,340 --> 01:49:26,560
No more rabbits up here?

1415
01:49:26,640 --> 01:49:34,020
Oh, give me a break.

1416
01:49:41,020 --> 01:49:43,579
It's wabbit season.

1417
01:49:43,579 --> 01:49:54,529
No, no more of these coats.

1418
01:49:54,529 --> 01:49:55,529
Duck season.

1419
01:49:55,529 --> 01:49:56,899
Wabbit season.

1420
01:49:56,899 --> 01:49:57,899
Duck season.

1421
01:50:02,899 --> 01:50:08,539
What a classic cartoon comedy.

1422
01:50:08,539 --> 01:50:09,539
Debt season.

1423
01:50:09,539 --> 01:50:11,100
No.

1424
01:50:11,100 --> 01:50:12,100
No.

1425
01:50:12,100 --> 01:50:13,100
I'm not gonna leave.

1426
01:50:13,100 --> 01:50:15,100
Because, look, they just respawn.

1427
01:50:15,100 --> 01:50:16,100
I'm just gonna just...

1428
01:50:16,699 --> 01:50:17,699
I'm just gonna game this completely.

1429
01:50:17,699 --> 01:50:21,859
I'm just gonna walk around the circle until I chain like 30 of them together.

1430
01:50:21,859 --> 01:50:33,619
This is gonna be one rider.

1431
01:50:33,619 --> 01:50:38,180
Dammit.

1432
01:50:38,180 --> 01:50:39,180
I need...

1433
01:50:39,180 --> 01:50:40,180
I still need 120 thousand.

1434
01:50:40,180 --> 01:50:41,180
I could...

1435
01:50:41,180 --> 01:50:46,720
Look, if I liquidate my entire inventory, I'll be able to do it.

1436
01:50:46,720 --> 01:50:47,720
That strategy's not gonna work.

1437
01:50:47,720 --> 01:50:48,720
Let's go.

1438
01:50:48,720 --> 01:50:51,369
Rabbits.

1439
01:50:51,369 --> 01:50:52,369
Oh, a lot of them.

1440
01:50:52,369 --> 01:50:53,369
Come on.

1441
01:50:53,369 --> 01:50:54,369
Yes!

1442
01:50:54,369 --> 01:50:55,369
Alright.

1443
01:50:55,369 --> 01:50:59,039
I need two more of these.

1444
01:50:59,039 --> 01:51:00,760
I do have 15 floors to work with.

1445
01:51:00,760 --> 01:51:05,460
That's true.

1446
01:51:05,460 --> 01:51:07,460
Rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit.

1447
01:51:07,819 --> 01:51:11,770
Hey, did you guys know that if you wake up on the first day of spring and say rabbit,

1448
01:51:11,770 --> 01:51:23,010
rabbit, it gives you good luck forever?

1449
01:51:23,010 --> 01:51:24,010
That's not bullshit.

1450
01:51:24,010 --> 01:51:26,210
Like, that's an actual, like, folk tale thing.

1451
01:51:26,210 --> 01:51:27,699
That's not...

1452
01:51:27,699 --> 01:51:28,699
That wasn't a joke.

1453
01:51:28,699 --> 01:51:29,699
I was actually saying that.

1454
01:51:29,699 --> 01:51:30,699
Like, that's a...

1455
01:51:30,699 --> 01:51:33,699
Just a perception of something that was told.

1456
01:51:33,699 --> 01:51:37,060
Alright, well, I'm out of...

1457
01:51:37,060 --> 01:51:39,060
I'm out of things to hit.

1458
01:51:40,060 --> 01:51:47,079
Let me try to get some more items.

1459
01:51:52,689 --> 01:51:53,689
Was that on your Facebook page?

1460
01:51:53,770 --> 01:51:58,329
No, actually, it was on, like, Nickelodeon one time.

1461
01:51:58,329 --> 01:52:04,329
It was one of the in-between advertisements for, like, Doug to Ren and Stimpy.

1462
01:52:04,329 --> 01:52:10,939
I actually think, like, Stick Stickly said it.

1463
01:52:25,729 --> 01:52:26,729
Ooh, gimme...

1464
01:52:26,729 --> 01:52:28,100
Ready?

1465
01:52:30,100 --> 01:52:31,100
How is that not a chain?

1466
01:52:39,199 --> 01:52:40,199
Alright.

1467
01:52:40,279 --> 01:52:50,069
I want more, and I can make it.

1468
01:52:56,789 --> 01:52:57,789
A lot of gnolls.

1469
01:53:00,100 --> 01:53:01,100
Nobody dropped anything.

1470
01:53:01,100 --> 01:53:04,770
Dammit.

1471
01:53:05,770 --> 01:53:07,770
If you crit, it should be a guaranteed item.

1472
01:53:16,819 --> 01:53:19,439
I think I came back up here.

1473
01:53:22,439 --> 01:53:24,260
Done.

1474
01:53:24,260 --> 01:53:27,060
But that doesn't mean we are done, because I still need a backscratcher and I still need

1475
01:53:27,060 --> 01:53:33,890
honey.

1476
01:53:33,890 --> 01:53:38,149
Not even chaining Omega Lol, and I still did it.

1477
01:53:39,029 --> 01:53:45,260
Slime liver.

1478
01:53:46,260 --> 01:53:47,260
Wait, any more of these guys?

1479
01:53:54,779 --> 01:53:56,659
Just a pendant.

1480
01:53:57,659 --> 01:54:04,010
Looks like the backscratcher are from chests or the rat boss.

1481
01:54:06,850 --> 01:54:08,850
That doesn't leave me with very many options, does it?

1482
01:54:08,850 --> 01:54:14,100
You can still get higher grade furball, yeah.

1483
01:54:20,010 --> 01:54:23,310
What were the other items that I needed from, um...

1484
01:54:26,579 --> 01:54:27,579
Furball.

1485
01:54:31,819 --> 01:54:35,699
The honey drops from another lizard, too, yeah.

1486
01:54:41,619 --> 01:54:43,619
Thanks for the boost, I'll take it.

1487
01:54:45,890 --> 01:54:47,890
Honey drops from the bees, I'm assuming, right?

1488
01:54:55,729 --> 01:54:59,270
Lizards.

1489
01:55:03,880 --> 01:55:04,880
Backscratcher in here, come on.

1490
01:55:16,720 --> 01:55:20,720
The honey is really, really expensive, too, so whatever I get out of it, it better be

1491
01:55:20,720 --> 01:55:23,500
good.

1492
01:55:23,500 --> 01:55:24,500
Whatever the crafting is.

1493
01:55:28,680 --> 01:55:29,680
Backscratcher.

1494
01:55:29,680 --> 01:55:30,680
What?

1495
01:55:30,680 --> 01:55:32,619
Is it corn?

1496
01:55:32,619 --> 01:55:33,619
Is it corn on the cob?

1497
01:55:34,500 --> 01:55:45,470
I'm gonna wrap it down here.

1498
01:55:45,470 --> 01:55:46,470
That's what's killed us.

1499
01:55:49,460 --> 01:55:51,460
Alright, let's see if I can get the big slime.

1500
01:55:58,920 --> 01:55:59,920
Drop it.

1501
01:55:59,920 --> 01:56:00,920
Drop it.

1502
01:56:12,359 --> 01:56:13,359
What?

1503
01:56:13,359 --> 01:56:14,359
What was that hitbox?

1504
01:56:15,359 --> 01:56:16,359
Give it to me.

1505
01:56:16,359 --> 01:56:17,359
Is that it?

1506
01:56:17,359 --> 01:56:18,359
I think that's it.

1507
01:56:19,930 --> 01:56:20,930
Is that...

1508
01:56:20,930 --> 01:56:21,930
Slime Lover!

1509
01:56:21,930 --> 01:56:22,930
I got it!

1510
01:56:22,930 --> 01:56:23,930
Okay, okay, I got it, I got it, I got it.

1511
01:56:23,930 --> 01:56:35,640
I wonder how much that sells for, just normally.

1512
01:56:47,340 --> 01:56:49,340
I'm so happy that I got that.

1513
01:56:57,180 --> 01:57:03,350
You are a winner, so far.

1514
01:57:06,350 --> 01:57:08,350
I'm trying to go too fast.

1515
01:57:08,350 --> 01:57:15,029
Save it for the Redditor.

1516
01:57:15,029 --> 01:57:18,029
Why do you guys keep calling that guy a Redditor?

1517
01:57:18,909 --> 01:57:20,909
Is that just going way over my head?

1518
01:57:20,909 --> 01:57:27,420
Why is he a Redditor?

1519
01:57:27,420 --> 01:57:38,060
He feels like a Redditor.

1520
01:57:38,060 --> 01:57:40,060
I don't know what that means.

1521
01:57:40,060 --> 01:57:42,060
He feels like a Redditor.

1522
01:57:42,060 --> 01:57:44,060
This is worth 6,300 bucks.

1523
01:57:44,060 --> 01:57:59,300
I didn't know that you could classify somebody like that.

1524
01:57:59,300 --> 01:58:00,859
That's not a bad...

1525
01:58:00,859 --> 01:58:01,859
That's a long go.

1526
01:58:01,859 --> 01:58:04,859
I'm getting some good items down here.

1527
01:58:04,859 --> 01:58:08,479
I don't want that.

1528
01:58:08,479 --> 01:58:09,479
Backscratcher.

1529
01:58:10,729 --> 01:58:11,729
Damn it.

1530
01:58:11,729 --> 01:58:21,710
That's because you don't identify as a Redditor.

1531
01:58:21,710 --> 01:58:22,710
You don't understand.

1532
01:58:25,869 --> 01:58:26,869
No, I don't.

1533
01:58:26,869 --> 01:58:27,869
I don't understand.

1534
01:58:28,869 --> 01:58:29,869
Bingo!

1535
01:58:32,329 --> 01:58:44,189
And you didn't think I was going to get to 200,000.

1536
01:58:44,189 --> 01:58:45,189
I still don't.

1537
01:58:45,189 --> 01:58:48,189
But anyways, what I was trying to say is...

1538
01:58:48,189 --> 01:58:49,189
How does...

1539
01:58:49,189 --> 01:58:54,189
I don't know how you identify yourself as reading the news from a website.

1540
01:58:56,619 --> 01:59:07,760
I don't understand.

1541
01:59:07,760 --> 01:59:08,760
News.

1542
01:59:09,640 --> 01:59:14,119
He only reads the news.

1543
01:59:14,119 --> 01:59:15,119
I don't know.

1544
01:59:15,119 --> 01:59:17,739
What do you do on Reddit?

1545
01:59:17,739 --> 01:59:19,739
Besides read the news.

1546
01:59:28,420 --> 01:59:29,420
Boots!

1547
01:59:32,960 --> 01:59:36,819
Any more rabbits?

1548
01:59:37,819 --> 01:59:38,819
Who the fuck?

1549
01:59:38,819 --> 01:59:44,159
What are you guys doing down here?

1550
01:59:44,159 --> 01:59:45,159
Oh, receipt!

1551
01:59:45,159 --> 01:59:50,979
What a coincidence meeting you here.

1552
01:59:50,979 --> 01:59:53,979
I identify as a Wall Street Journaler.

1553
01:59:53,979 --> 01:59:59,100
How are you, Alouette?

1554
01:59:59,100 --> 02:00:01,100
Oh, you're dungeon crawling as well, I see.

1555
02:00:01,100 --> 02:00:05,180
And with such a seedy-looking adventurer.

1556
02:00:06,060 --> 02:00:11,920
My adventurer friend isn't seedy-looking, and we did this joke already.

1557
02:00:11,920 --> 02:00:12,920
Self-aware.

1558
02:00:12,920 --> 02:00:14,289
I like it.

1559
02:00:14,289 --> 02:00:17,289
I suppose a seedy adventurer is appropriate for a seedy merchant.

1560
02:00:17,289 --> 02:00:22,340
Anyone else feel like that was backwards?

1561
02:00:22,340 --> 02:00:25,779
That if you play that in reverse, it'll sound like a regular laugh?

1562
02:00:25,779 --> 02:00:32,880
That's how they do that, right?

1563
02:00:32,880 --> 02:00:33,880
Well, come on, everyone.

1564
02:00:33,880 --> 02:00:35,880
Don't bother picking up the inexpensive garbage.

1565
02:00:35,880 --> 02:00:36,880
Only the best for us.

1566
02:00:36,880 --> 02:00:47,750
It would be so funny if this thing just grabbed her and punched her in the face.

1567
02:00:48,750 --> 02:00:52,819
You have like four adventurers!

1568
02:00:53,699 --> 02:00:54,699
That's stupid.

1569
02:00:54,699 --> 02:01:07,779
That's not fair.

1570
02:01:07,779 --> 02:01:19,460
Damn it!

1571
02:01:19,460 --> 02:01:20,460
He knew.

1572
02:01:20,460 --> 02:01:34,390
Well, any more of those gnolls?

1573
02:01:34,390 --> 02:01:35,390
No.

1574
02:01:35,390 --> 02:01:37,390
Might as well get a double.

1575
02:01:37,390 --> 02:01:41,739
You'll never understand the struggles of a Redditor.

1576
02:01:41,739 --> 02:01:43,739
Go back to 4chan.

1577
02:01:58,579 --> 02:02:00,460
Floor 8.

1578
02:02:00,460 --> 02:02:01,460
Let's go.

1579
02:02:01,460 --> 02:02:06,020
What'd she say?

1580
02:02:06,020 --> 02:02:11,020
I need my, like, I need my, like, Redditors to translate that.

1581
02:02:11,020 --> 02:02:14,020
Ooh, a sack of gold!

1582
02:02:14,020 --> 02:02:15,020
Nut mix.

1583
02:02:23,489 --> 02:02:32,810
Did I invest in Bitcoin?

1584
02:02:32,810 --> 02:02:36,899
I don't, I don't even know what that is.

1585
02:02:36,899 --> 02:02:45,119
I've heard of that before.

1586
02:02:49,020 --> 02:02:54,699
Just get out of my way, thing.

1587
02:02:54,699 --> 02:03:07,069
I do like this little item run, though.

1588
02:03:07,069 --> 02:03:13,939
I know that it was, it was like, it was like a scam, right?

1589
02:03:13,939 --> 02:03:19,119
That's all I, all I remember.

1590
02:03:19,119 --> 02:03:21,119
It was like a scam or something, right?

1591
02:03:21,119 --> 02:03:26,619
That's what somebody in the office told me.

1592
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:41,020
I need to get rid of something.

1593
02:03:41,020 --> 02:03:42,020
What do I get rid of?

1594
02:03:42,020 --> 02:03:43,020
Everything I have?

1595
02:03:43,020 --> 02:03:44,020
The raincoats?

1596
02:03:44,020 --> 02:03:45,020
The raincoats are shitty.

1597
02:03:45,020 --> 02:03:51,800
I have, I need the fur balls.

1598
02:03:51,800 --> 02:03:54,869
The insect traps.

1599
02:03:54,869 --> 02:03:55,869
The nut mix is a thousand.

1600
02:03:55,869 --> 02:04:01,800
I'm just gonna eat the chocolate.

1601
02:04:01,800 --> 02:04:02,800
Backscratcher.

1602
02:04:02,800 --> 02:04:05,039
I mean, that's still pretty good.

1603
02:04:05,039 --> 02:04:18,500
I have one extra, but what if I need it?

1604
02:04:18,500 --> 02:04:24,500
Why is Dermis such a Redditor?

1605
02:04:24,500 --> 02:04:25,500
It's freaking me out.

1606
02:04:25,500 --> 02:04:32,939
I don't even know what you're talking about!

1607
02:04:33,880 --> 02:04:49,539
This is so over my head, it's freaking me out.

1608
02:04:49,539 --> 02:05:03,939
Why do you eat like a Redditor?

1609
02:05:03,939 --> 02:05:04,939
No, I don't want this.

1610
02:05:04,939 --> 02:05:14,659
I have one extra fur ball, but I'm probably gonna need it if I wanted to ever do this

1611
02:05:14,659 --> 02:05:16,149
again.

1612
02:05:16,149 --> 02:05:17,149
Should I?

1613
02:05:17,149 --> 02:05:22,500
Get rid of this charm.

1614
02:05:22,500 --> 02:05:23,939
Backscratcher.

1615
02:05:23,939 --> 02:05:24,939
Fuck.

1616
02:05:24,939 --> 02:05:31,380
Please do the nice girl laugh.

1617
02:05:31,380 --> 02:05:38,840
Get rid of the shitty fur ball, but I might need it.

1618
02:05:38,840 --> 02:05:55,579
If I get enough of those fur balls, I can make two.

1619
02:05:56,220 --> 02:05:57,720
Count them.

1620
02:05:57,720 --> 02:05:58,720
Two!

1621
02:05:58,720 --> 02:06:02,970
Two!

1622
02:06:02,970 --> 02:06:03,970
Two!

1623
02:06:03,970 --> 02:06:05,460
Triple kill.

1624
02:06:05,460 --> 02:06:08,829
I need a lizard too.

1625
02:06:08,829 --> 02:06:09,829
Lizard.

1626
02:06:09,829 --> 02:06:10,829
Lizard.

1627
02:06:10,829 --> 02:06:11,829
No lizard.

1628
02:06:11,829 --> 02:06:13,260
Bullshit.

1629
02:06:13,260 --> 02:06:19,260
I don't want the cherry.

1630
02:06:19,260 --> 02:06:29,199
Maybe I'll get it from the rat.

1631
02:06:29,199 --> 02:06:30,199
Can't carry anymore.

1632
02:06:30,199 --> 02:06:31,199
Wooden shield.

1633
02:06:31,199 --> 02:06:32,199
Garbage.

1634
02:06:32,199 --> 02:06:33,199
Raincoat.

1635
02:06:33,199 --> 02:06:37,189
Garbage.

1636
02:06:37,189 --> 02:06:38,189
Bra.

1637
02:06:38,189 --> 02:06:39,189
I don't need a bra.

1638
02:06:39,189 --> 02:06:40,189
I'm gonna throw it away.

1639
02:06:44,020 --> 02:06:47,460
Alright, I'll get rid of one fur ball.

1640
02:06:47,460 --> 02:06:50,109
And the bra.

1641
02:06:50,109 --> 02:06:51,369
It's 800 bucks though.

1642
02:06:51,369 --> 02:07:06,500
I can't.

1643
02:07:06,500 --> 02:07:08,500
I can't.

1644
02:07:08,500 --> 02:07:09,500
I can't.

1645
02:07:09,500 --> 02:07:14,329
I need...

1646
02:07:14,329 --> 02:07:16,850
Here we go.

1647
02:07:16,850 --> 02:07:17,850
Backscratcher from the rat.

1648
02:07:17,850 --> 02:07:33,300
Here comes Ratwheel.

1649
02:07:33,300 --> 02:07:36,300
Oops, I forgot you could do that.

1650
02:07:36,300 --> 02:07:37,300
Eat.

1651
02:07:37,300 --> 02:07:38,300
Eat.

1652
02:07:38,300 --> 02:07:40,369
Eat.

1653
02:07:40,369 --> 02:07:46,670
Oh, that is a heal.

1654
02:07:46,670 --> 02:08:00,810
I'm not sure I contemplated if that was gonna be a heal.

1655
02:08:00,810 --> 02:08:01,810
Eat one.

1656
02:08:01,810 --> 02:08:06,489
Eat it.

1657
02:08:06,489 --> 02:08:14,609
Stop making me contemplate.

1658
02:08:14,609 --> 02:08:28,420
Alright, backscratcher do it.

1659
02:08:28,420 --> 02:08:29,420
Come on please.

1660
02:08:29,420 --> 02:08:30,699
I need this.

1661
02:08:30,699 --> 02:08:35,020
I need this.

1662
02:08:35,020 --> 02:08:36,020
Well, I got...

1663
02:08:36,020 --> 02:08:37,510
Okay.

1664
02:08:38,390 --> 02:08:41,739
I need to get another child.

1665
02:08:41,739 --> 02:08:53,100
So, what was the last thing I needed for that stupid order?

1666
02:08:53,100 --> 02:08:55,319
I needed the lizard.

1667
02:08:55,319 --> 02:08:57,039
I needed the batwing.

1668
02:08:57,039 --> 02:08:59,619
I got it.

1669
02:08:59,619 --> 02:09:04,829
It's probably gonna be a shitload of money, isn't it?

1670
02:09:04,829 --> 02:09:08,890
Okay, it may be time to call it a day here.

1671
02:09:08,890 --> 02:09:20,409
Because I'm running out of room.

1672
02:09:20,409 --> 02:09:21,970
Yeah, it's time to go.

1673
02:09:21,970 --> 02:09:24,170
No, not the stream.

1674
02:09:24,170 --> 02:09:25,170
I'm talking about the run.

1675
02:09:25,170 --> 02:09:29,750
Yeah, I gotta go back.

1676
02:09:29,750 --> 02:09:30,750
I gotta...

1677
02:09:30,750 --> 02:09:31,750
Here.

1678
02:09:31,750 --> 02:09:32,750
I gotta...

1679
02:09:33,609 --> 02:09:38,430
You know what I'm saying?

1680
02:09:38,430 --> 02:09:52,890
This is my last shot these next couple days.

1681
02:09:52,890 --> 02:09:55,850
Alright, news.

1682
02:09:55,850 --> 02:09:58,850
The price of food has decreased.

1683
02:09:58,850 --> 02:10:00,850
The price of swords has normalized.

1684
02:10:00,850 --> 02:10:04,720
Whatever.

1685
02:10:04,720 --> 02:10:10,140
So, fusion time.

1686
02:10:10,140 --> 02:10:14,260
I have 48 hours.

1687
02:10:14,260 --> 02:10:15,880
Time for fusion.

1688
02:10:15,880 --> 02:10:22,560
First of all, the dude's gonna come back.

1689
02:10:22,560 --> 02:10:24,560
I have it all.

1690
02:10:24,560 --> 02:10:27,000
And then I need two hats for today as well.

1691
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:32,739
Here we go.

1692
02:10:32,739 --> 02:10:34,810
Fusion.

1693
02:10:34,810 --> 02:10:36,590
Rank 1 staff.

1694
02:10:36,590 --> 02:10:39,590
I don't have the back scratcher required, but I have the other stuff.

1695
02:10:39,590 --> 02:10:41,069
I need a sturdy glove.

1696
02:10:41,069 --> 02:10:49,239
So, that's one there.

1697
02:10:49,239 --> 02:10:50,239
Okay.

1698
02:10:50,239 --> 02:10:52,310
Ready?

1699
02:10:52,310 --> 02:11:02,630
This took a long time to make.

1700
02:11:02,630 --> 02:11:07,270
It's a, like, Fourth of July hat, and it's 3,800 bucks.

1701
02:11:07,270 --> 02:11:18,359
Wonderful.

1702
02:11:18,359 --> 02:11:19,359
Okay.

1703
02:11:19,359 --> 02:11:20,359
That...

1704
02:11:20,359 --> 02:11:21,359
I need a sturdy glove.

1705
02:11:21,359 --> 02:11:28,279
Shit, better be worth it.

1706
02:11:34,590 --> 02:11:39,069
Like, 15, at least.

1707
02:11:39,069 --> 02:11:40,069
No.

1708
02:11:40,069 --> 02:11:41,069
3850.

1709
02:11:41,069 --> 02:11:42,069
That's nothing.

1710
02:11:42,069 --> 02:11:46,829
Shit.

1711
02:11:46,829 --> 02:12:01,449
I'm in trouble now.

1712
02:12:01,449 --> 02:12:31,979
I could have just sold the three honey for, like, 8,060.

1713
02:12:31,979 --> 02:12:40,369
It's gonna be close.

1714
02:12:40,369 --> 02:12:43,909
Just put the most, just put only expensive shit up here.

1715
02:12:43,909 --> 02:13:00,119
Nothing else.

1716
02:13:00,119 --> 02:13:02,199
But what if he comes back?

1717
02:13:02,199 --> 02:13:03,199
Okay.

1718
02:13:03,199 --> 02:13:07,149
If he comes back, what if he gives me a ton of money?

1719
02:13:07,149 --> 02:13:09,149
What if he's, like, a trillionaire or something?

1720
02:13:09,149 --> 02:13:17,520
Alright, here we go.

1721
02:13:17,520 --> 02:13:27,970
I only have the expensive shit up.

1722
02:13:28,409 --> 02:13:32,729
I need, I need these two hats, because I'm gonna, this is gonna be an extremely expensive

1723
02:13:32,729 --> 02:13:33,729
two hats for that lady.

1724
02:13:33,729 --> 02:13:35,409
I don't want to put them out.

1725
02:13:35,409 --> 02:13:40,609
There's a lady coming in today that wants two hats.

1726
02:13:40,609 --> 02:13:55,039
Let's go.

1727
02:13:55,039 --> 02:14:03,439
Welcome to...

1728
02:14:03,439 --> 02:14:04,439
Oh, right.

1729
02:14:04,439 --> 02:14:05,439
There is!

1730
02:14:05,439 --> 02:14:06,439
Okay.

1731
02:14:06,439 --> 02:14:08,640
Like, 50 grand.

1732
02:14:08,640 --> 02:14:09,840
Did you finally manage to get my order?

1733
02:14:09,840 --> 02:14:11,850
I did.

1734
02:14:11,850 --> 02:14:14,090
Is your last supposed to creep out the customers?

1735
02:14:14,090 --> 02:14:15,090
Or is that just money?

1736
02:14:15,090 --> 02:14:16,090
Give me some money.

1737
02:14:16,090 --> 02:14:17,090
Look, and you got, like, a prince cape on.

1738
02:14:17,090 --> 02:14:18,090
You have, like, an outfit on.

1739
02:14:18,090 --> 02:14:19,090
You have a big collar.

1740
02:14:19,210 --> 02:14:22,850
You're like Dracula or you're a prince that has a lot of money.

1741
02:14:22,850 --> 02:14:23,850
Either one.

1742
02:14:23,850 --> 02:14:28,010
Dracula also probably has a lot of money.

1743
02:14:28,010 --> 02:14:29,010
What are the name of...

1744
02:14:29,010 --> 02:14:30,010
Duh-duh-duh.

1745
02:14:30,010 --> 02:14:31,010
Have you no shame?

1746
02:14:31,010 --> 02:14:33,210
You're not happy?

1747
02:14:33,210 --> 02:14:35,970
Given how long I had to wait for this.

1748
02:14:35,970 --> 02:14:38,560
Well, whatever.

1749
02:14:38,560 --> 02:14:40,279
I did put in the order.

1750
02:14:40,279 --> 02:14:42,340
And I, sorry.

1751
02:14:42,340 --> 02:14:44,180
And I do still need these.

1752
02:14:44,180 --> 02:14:45,739
So I'll go ahead and take them now.

1753
02:14:45,739 --> 02:14:46,739
Here's the fee.

1754
02:14:46,739 --> 02:14:49,739
Thank the owner for me.

1755
02:14:49,739 --> 02:14:51,579
Despite the delay, I do appreciate the help.

1756
02:14:51,579 --> 02:14:53,609
How much money is it?

1757
02:14:53,609 --> 02:14:55,890
I told you I am the owner.

1758
02:14:55,890 --> 02:14:56,890
I don't care how much money.

1759
02:14:56,890 --> 02:15:00,800
You really don't know when to give up on a prank, do you?

1760
02:15:00,800 --> 02:15:03,840
In any event, you do need to learn to deal with customers better.

1761
02:15:03,840 --> 02:15:08,359
I'll be coming in here more often from now on, so expect good service.

1762
02:15:08,359 --> 02:15:10,630
What's the fee?

1763
02:15:10,630 --> 02:15:12,510
I can deal with normal customers just fine.

1764
02:15:12,510 --> 02:15:15,859
Thank you.

1765
02:15:15,859 --> 02:15:16,859
What was it?

1766
02:15:16,859 --> 02:15:17,859
That was it?

1767
02:15:17,859 --> 02:15:18,859
3,800.

1768
02:15:18,859 --> 02:15:19,859
That's it?

1769
02:15:19,859 --> 02:15:21,680
That's it.

1770
02:15:21,680 --> 02:15:22,680
It's over.

1771
02:15:22,680 --> 02:15:23,680
I lose.

1772
02:15:23,680 --> 02:15:28,949
I was really riding on that being at least 20.

1773
02:15:28,949 --> 02:15:31,079
Okay.

1774
02:15:31,079 --> 02:15:32,560
34,000.

1775
02:15:32,560 --> 02:15:33,560
It's in high demand.

1776
02:15:33,560 --> 02:15:40,880
It's a hot item.

1777
02:15:41,720 --> 02:15:51,199
I can't charge $120,000.

1778
02:15:51,199 --> 02:15:53,399
I have to sell it.

1779
02:15:53,399 --> 02:15:54,399
2,900.

1780
02:15:54,399 --> 02:16:01,079
2,800.

1781
02:16:01,079 --> 02:16:08,300
I need to sell things.

1782
02:16:08,300 --> 02:16:11,750
Somebody buy one of the 15, $20,000 items.

1783
02:16:11,750 --> 02:16:12,750
Can I get a book?

1784
02:16:12,750 --> 02:16:15,319
I don't have any books.

1785
02:16:15,319 --> 02:16:16,319
Go home.

1786
02:16:16,319 --> 02:16:22,489
Grandpa.

1787
02:16:22,489 --> 02:16:25,659
Grandpa wants to buy a treasure.

1788
02:16:25,659 --> 02:16:31,380
No, this one on the table.

1789
02:16:31,380 --> 02:16:34,989
This one on the table.

1790
02:16:34,989 --> 02:16:39,709
This one's sitting right over there.

1791
02:16:39,709 --> 02:16:41,709
Can I just use a ring?

1792
02:16:41,709 --> 02:16:48,159
I think this is what you're looking for.

1793
02:16:48,159 --> 02:16:54,469
Not what I wanted.

1794
02:16:54,469 --> 02:16:55,469
The hats.

1795
02:16:55,469 --> 02:17:14,620
I'm so fucked.

1796
02:17:14,620 --> 02:17:18,549
It's not going to happen.

1797
02:17:18,549 --> 02:17:19,549
13,000.

1798
02:17:19,549 --> 02:17:20,549
14,000.

1799
02:17:20,549 --> 02:17:22,940
13.

1800
02:17:22,940 --> 02:17:28,340
Fuck.

1801
02:17:28,340 --> 02:17:48,219
I'm only $100,000 away.

1802
02:17:48,219 --> 02:18:07,120
God damn it.

1803
02:18:07,120 --> 02:18:10,540
Somebody buy this shit.

1804
02:18:10,540 --> 02:18:13,590
Somebody buy it now.

1805
02:18:13,790 --> 02:18:16,059
I have expensive items.

1806
02:18:16,059 --> 02:18:18,000
Okay.

1807
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:22,200
I can do that.

1808
02:18:22,200 --> 02:18:23,200
7,500.

1809
02:18:23,200 --> 02:18:30,159
That's 220.

1810
02:18:30,159 --> 02:18:32,399
Higher than 220?

1811
02:18:32,399 --> 02:18:37,049
8,000?

1812
02:18:37,049 --> 02:18:38,049
I can do it.

1813
02:18:38,049 --> 02:18:39,049
I can do it.

1814
02:18:39,049 --> 02:18:42,280
I can do this.

1815
02:18:42,280 --> 02:18:44,670
Come on.

1816
02:18:44,670 --> 02:18:45,670
Piece of armor.

1817
02:18:45,670 --> 02:18:52,270
I mean, that's technically armor, isn't it?

1818
02:18:52,270 --> 02:18:57,479
The power glove is armor.

1819
02:18:57,479 --> 02:19:02,409
This is armor.

1820
02:19:02,409 --> 02:19:03,409
The cape is armor.

1821
02:19:03,409 --> 02:19:09,899
$15,000.

1822
02:19:09,899 --> 02:19:15,879
It's armor.

1823
02:19:15,879 --> 02:19:18,079
It's not armor.

1824
02:19:18,079 --> 02:19:19,079
You guys lied.

1825
02:19:22,829 --> 02:19:29,950
I don't want to spend fucking $1,000.

1826
02:19:29,950 --> 02:19:30,950
Go home.

1827
02:19:30,950 --> 02:19:34,159
I need to open this door again.

1828
02:19:34,159 --> 02:19:36,159
Somebody just take a ring or the power glove.

1829
02:19:36,159 --> 02:19:37,159
Wait a minute.

1830
02:19:37,159 --> 02:19:38,159
It's the prince.

1831
02:19:38,159 --> 02:19:41,649
Hey, it came by to sell this to you.

1832
02:19:41,649 --> 02:19:48,440
No, not you two.

1833
02:19:48,440 --> 02:19:52,479
Somebody poisoned you out there and now you're part of like the yam.

1834
02:19:52,479 --> 02:19:53,479
The scams.

1835
02:19:53,479 --> 02:20:02,079
Here we go.

1836
02:20:02,079 --> 02:20:06,620
This is the day where everyone's going to die.

1837
02:20:07,579 --> 02:20:08,579
I don't want this.

1838
02:20:08,579 --> 02:20:09,579
Please.

1839
02:20:09,579 --> 02:20:11,260
Just somebody buy something.

1840
02:20:11,260 --> 02:20:13,780
I don't want to buy your things.

1841
02:20:13,780 --> 02:20:15,059
I want you to buy my things.

1842
02:20:15,059 --> 02:20:30,459
I have to open the store again.

1843
02:20:30,459 --> 02:20:31,459
Put out food.

1844
02:20:31,459 --> 02:20:34,870
Put the cape out.

1845
02:20:34,870 --> 02:20:36,270
All this shit is already here.

1846
02:20:36,270 --> 02:20:52,250
No, the food is...

1847
02:20:52,250 --> 02:20:53,930
I'm going to put the boots out.

1848
02:20:53,930 --> 02:20:55,370
I'll put the chest out.

1849
02:20:55,370 --> 02:21:04,549
Let's go.

1850
02:21:04,549 --> 02:21:10,350
Here are the boots.

1851
02:21:10,350 --> 02:21:14,479
I'll do 120.

1852
02:21:14,479 --> 02:21:16,489
Cape.

1853
02:21:16,489 --> 02:21:20,549
All right.

1854
02:21:20,549 --> 02:21:23,579
All right.

1855
02:21:24,420 --> 02:21:36,649
We got a big sale here, except it's this cheap lady, 18,000.

1856
02:21:36,649 --> 02:21:37,649
She's not going to buy it.

1857
02:21:37,649 --> 02:21:38,649
She's going to walk out.

1858
02:21:38,649 --> 02:21:41,520
I cannot afford this lady to walk out right now.

1859
02:21:41,520 --> 02:21:46,909
I'm going to say 18,5 or 20.

1860
02:21:46,909 --> 02:21:47,909
No, no, no, no.

1861
02:21:47,909 --> 02:21:48,909
That's too high.

1862
02:21:48,909 --> 02:21:49,909
She'll...

1863
02:21:49,909 --> 02:21:51,469
She always says no.

1864
02:21:51,469 --> 02:21:56,229
She's going to say no.

1865
02:21:56,229 --> 02:21:57,510
She's not going to back down.

1866
02:21:57,510 --> 02:21:58,510
I have to do 18.

1867
02:21:58,510 --> 02:21:59,510
Otherwise I lose.

1868
02:21:59,510 --> 02:22:11,770
In fact, we're doing 17,9 or 17, like five.

1869
02:22:11,770 --> 02:22:12,950
Yeah.

1870
02:22:12,950 --> 02:22:13,950
I can't afford to lose this.

1871
02:22:14,149 --> 02:22:21,680
So I have to sell this.

1872
02:22:21,680 --> 02:22:22,680
Come on.

1873
02:22:22,680 --> 02:22:23,840
I can do this.

1874
02:22:23,840 --> 02:22:24,840
I can do this.

1875
02:22:24,840 --> 02:22:25,840
I have one more day.

1876
02:22:25,840 --> 02:22:26,840
I just have to make a little bit more money and I'm done.

1877
02:22:26,840 --> 02:22:37,870
I just have to make like 60,000.

1878
02:22:37,870 --> 02:22:47,030
The price of precious metals has decreased.

1879
02:22:47,030 --> 02:22:48,030
Get the staff up here.

1880
02:22:48,030 --> 02:22:57,159
There's no way I'm going to have 75,000 in one day, but there is a way, and that is I

1881
02:22:57,159 --> 02:23:02,620
liquidate everything I own at the store downstream.

1882
02:23:02,620 --> 02:23:03,620
It might happen.

1883
02:23:03,620 --> 02:23:09,079
It's today.

1884
02:23:09,079 --> 02:23:22,770
It's at the end of the day today.

1885
02:23:23,250 --> 02:23:27,250
I have three save files that are all like 30 minutes apart.

1886
02:23:27,250 --> 02:23:34,659
This is like an hour apart from this.

1887
02:23:34,659 --> 02:23:35,659
Let's hold on.

1888
02:23:35,659 --> 02:23:36,940
Let's just see what happens here.

1889
02:23:36,940 --> 02:23:46,110
I'm okay with liquidating stuff if it means to stay alive.

1890
02:23:46,110 --> 02:23:56,010
I think if I liquidate everything, I'll be able to stay alive.

1891
02:23:56,010 --> 02:24:05,270
I'm going to try it.

1892
02:24:05,270 --> 02:24:06,270
Fill the counters.

1893
02:24:06,270 --> 02:24:07,270
I'm going to...

1894
02:24:07,270 --> 02:24:11,389
What do I have here?

1895
02:24:11,389 --> 02:24:12,389
I don't want to sell the foods.

1896
02:24:12,389 --> 02:24:14,389
No, we'll put a baked yam out there.

1897
02:24:14,389 --> 02:24:17,680
All right.

1898
02:24:17,680 --> 02:24:18,680
Let's go.

1899
02:24:18,680 --> 02:24:25,549
All right.

1900
02:24:25,549 --> 02:24:29,600
Grandpa wants the boots.

1901
02:24:29,680 --> 02:24:30,680
Bring it down a little bit.

1902
02:24:30,680 --> 02:24:31,680
I can do that for you.

1903
02:24:31,680 --> 02:24:36,250
2,000.

1904
02:24:36,250 --> 02:24:37,250
Come on.

1905
02:24:37,250 --> 02:24:41,350
Big item up top.

1906
02:24:41,350 --> 02:24:44,489
This is a present from my brother.

1907
02:24:44,489 --> 02:24:45,489
You ne...

1908
02:24:45,489 --> 02:24:46,489
Okay.

1909
02:24:46,489 --> 02:24:47,489
You never buy.

1910
02:24:47,489 --> 02:24:52,059
1,850.

1911
02:24:52,059 --> 02:24:53,059
Hot items.

1912
02:24:53,059 --> 02:24:54,059
Hot items.

1913
02:24:54,059 --> 02:24:55,059
Hot.

1914
02:24:55,059 --> 02:24:56,059
All right.

1915
02:24:56,059 --> 02:24:57,059
He's going to get a hot item.

1916
02:24:57,059 --> 02:24:58,059
Oh, no.

1917
02:24:58,059 --> 02:25:19,579
Stop selling me food.

1918
02:25:19,579 --> 02:25:21,940
Of course, the girl that doesn't want to pay more than 110%.

1919
02:25:21,940 --> 02:25:30,409
Come on.

1920
02:25:30,409 --> 02:25:31,409
He always...

1921
02:25:31,409 --> 02:25:32,409
This guy is so dumb.

1922
02:25:32,409 --> 02:25:34,409
He always buys the most expensive shit in the store.

1923
02:25:35,840 --> 02:25:44,879
I need two cold weather clothes in two days.

1924
02:25:44,879 --> 02:25:45,879
Come on.

1925
02:25:45,879 --> 02:25:47,889
No.

1926
02:25:47,889 --> 02:25:48,889
No.

1927
02:25:48,889 --> 02:26:04,079
Come on, old man.

1928
02:26:04,079 --> 02:26:05,079
No.

1929
02:26:05,079 --> 02:26:07,079
You want us to buy some candy?

1930
02:26:07,079 --> 02:26:56,360
We're going to have to do some liquidation.

1931
02:26:56,360 --> 02:27:14,600
Put the rings in the window.

1932
02:27:14,600 --> 02:27:16,600
I've got these awesome things in the window already.

1933
02:27:16,600 --> 02:27:17,600
You know, and only...

1934
02:27:17,600 --> 02:27:20,040
People only buy candy.

1935
02:27:20,040 --> 02:27:26,120
No, I don't want to put on a bunch of cheap shit.

1936
02:27:26,120 --> 02:27:27,120
I'm going to go...

1937
02:27:27,120 --> 02:27:34,239
We're going with this.

1938
02:27:34,239 --> 02:27:35,239
There we go.

1939
02:27:35,239 --> 02:27:36,239
All right.

1940
02:27:40,750 --> 02:27:41,750
7500.

1941
02:27:41,750 --> 02:27:44,440
It's that much.

1942
02:27:44,440 --> 02:27:46,440
You can't bring it down at all.

1943
02:27:46,440 --> 02:27:49,360
I can do 7200.

1944
02:27:49,360 --> 02:27:50,360
No.

1945
02:27:50,360 --> 02:27:58,200
7000.

1946
02:27:58,200 --> 02:28:17,870
Come on.

1947
02:28:17,870 --> 02:28:18,870
Buy the cloak.

1948
02:28:18,870 --> 02:28:22,000
Oh, I was looking for this.

1949
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:33,180
I don't want some fucking...

1950
02:28:33,180 --> 02:28:34,180
No.

1951
02:28:34,180 --> 02:28:42,239
I don't want it.

1952
02:28:42,239 --> 02:28:44,670
I don't want it.

1953
02:28:44,670 --> 02:28:51,450
I don't want it.

1954
02:28:51,450 --> 02:28:53,450
Oh, it was so cheap.

1955
02:28:53,450 --> 02:28:57,840
Somebody buy an expensive thing.

1956
02:28:57,840 --> 02:28:59,020
Looking for a treasure.

1957
02:28:59,020 --> 02:29:02,020
I don't have treasures here.

1958
02:29:02,020 --> 02:29:04,020
Here, have an unthankful statue.

1959
02:29:04,020 --> 02:29:22,450
At least I'll be able to sell it.

1960
02:29:22,450 --> 02:29:27,959
Mommy told me to buy this.

1961
02:29:27,959 --> 02:29:28,959
This girl.

1962
02:29:28,959 --> 02:29:31,959
I have to get it off the counter.

1963
02:29:31,959 --> 02:29:32,959
You've got to be kidding me.

1964
02:29:32,959 --> 02:29:34,959
You've got to be kidding me.

1965
02:29:34,959 --> 02:29:36,959
This is a racket right now.

1966
02:29:36,959 --> 02:29:37,959
Unbelievable.

1967
02:29:37,959 --> 02:29:41,090
It is getting dumb.

1968
02:29:41,090 --> 02:29:44,040
I'm in so much trouble.

1969
02:29:44,040 --> 02:29:47,600
The price of a heavy armor has decreased.

1970
02:29:47,600 --> 02:30:06,860
Flee the country.

1971
02:30:06,860 --> 02:30:09,680
Just get on a plane.

1972
02:30:09,680 --> 02:30:10,680
It's still possible.

1973
02:30:10,680 --> 02:30:11,680
It is.

1974
02:30:11,680 --> 02:30:19,360
I have to sell this stuff.

1975
02:30:19,360 --> 02:30:20,360
Get the...

1976
02:30:20,360 --> 02:30:22,360
Put the ring up here.

1977
02:30:22,360 --> 02:30:24,360
Where's my expensive ring?

1978
02:30:24,360 --> 02:30:25,659
7000.

1979
02:30:25,659 --> 02:30:33,979
How much is this one?

1980
02:30:33,979 --> 02:30:41,340
Get the food off the shelves.

1981
02:30:41,340 --> 02:30:50,079
Is it possible that I just only have the stuff in the window?

1982
02:30:50,079 --> 02:30:52,079
This is what's in here.

1983
02:30:52,079 --> 02:30:56,760
And then I can liquidate some stuff.

1984
02:30:56,760 --> 02:31:01,899
Sell everything in the market.

1985
02:31:01,899 --> 02:31:03,899
That's why I have that save point.

1986
02:31:03,899 --> 02:31:10,940
I'll have some of these out.

1987
02:31:10,940 --> 02:31:16,059
I have to make the money.

1988
02:31:16,059 --> 02:31:18,239
Let's have a little candy counter here.

1989
02:31:18,239 --> 02:31:24,829
Food counter.

1990
02:31:24,829 --> 02:31:26,829
Let's just go.

1991
02:31:26,829 --> 02:31:27,829
Open.

1992
02:31:27,829 --> 02:31:33,329
You actually want the ring.

1993
02:31:33,329 --> 02:31:35,020
Holy shit.

1994
02:31:35,020 --> 02:31:36,020
Okay.

1995
02:31:36,020 --> 02:31:38,020
She's not going to buy...

1996
02:31:38,020 --> 02:31:39,020
I have to start at base.

1997
02:31:39,020 --> 02:31:40,020
She's not...

1998
02:31:40,020 --> 02:31:41,020
Alright.

1999
02:31:41,020 --> 02:31:51,479
Come on.

2000
02:31:51,479 --> 02:31:53,479
Come on.

2001
02:31:53,479 --> 02:31:55,479
I can still do it.

2002
02:31:55,479 --> 02:32:06,700
Come on.

2003
02:32:06,700 --> 02:32:08,700
Somebody buy that cape.

2004
02:32:08,700 --> 02:32:21,819
Rich girl.

2005
02:32:21,819 --> 02:32:24,639
Rich girl wants to sell me an apple.

2006
02:32:24,639 --> 02:32:26,639
Doesn't ever want to buy anything.

2007
02:32:26,639 --> 02:32:37,479
Come on.

2008
02:32:37,479 --> 02:32:39,870
Can I get a book?

2009
02:32:39,870 --> 02:32:40,870
I don't have any books.

2010
02:32:40,870 --> 02:32:44,870
I just need like a few more sales and I will be able to get there.

2011
02:32:44,870 --> 02:32:45,870
Come on.

2012
02:32:45,870 --> 02:32:49,090
Prints.

2013
02:32:49,090 --> 02:32:52,090
Two weapons and I want them in three days.

2014
02:32:52,090 --> 02:32:53,090
Sure.

2015
02:32:53,090 --> 02:32:54,090
Oh fuck.

2016
02:32:54,090 --> 02:32:56,090
I forgot about the guy that wanted stuff in two days.

2017
02:32:56,090 --> 02:32:57,090
What did he want?

2018
02:32:57,090 --> 02:33:06,079
Okay.

2019
02:33:06,079 --> 02:33:07,079
In two days.

2020
02:33:07,079 --> 02:33:10,940
Too cold weather.

2021
02:33:10,940 --> 02:33:13,649
This is it.

2022
02:33:13,649 --> 02:33:14,649
This is how possible I was.

2023
02:33:14,649 --> 02:33:30,290
I might as well just accept my fate right now.

2024
02:33:30,290 --> 02:33:31,290
But hold on.

2025
02:33:31,290 --> 02:33:32,290
We don't even know what happens.

2026
02:33:32,290 --> 02:33:43,040
We don't even know what happens.

2027
02:33:43,040 --> 02:33:46,200
What happens?

2028
02:33:46,200 --> 02:34:05,040
What now?

2029
02:34:05,040 --> 02:34:10,079
I'm afraid this amount of money is insufficient.

2030
02:34:10,079 --> 02:34:14,079
I'm sorry, but as an agent of Termi Finance, I must now seize this house in order to repay

2031
02:34:14,079 --> 02:34:15,079
the outstanding debt.

2032
02:34:15,079 --> 02:34:34,329
And so the cute, courageous little heroine was crushed by the cruel bitterness of reality.

2033
02:34:34,329 --> 02:34:35,329
Wow.

2034
02:34:35,329 --> 02:34:38,920
Why did it have to end in a box?

2035
02:34:38,920 --> 02:34:51,319
This is a dream, right?

2036
02:34:51,319 --> 02:34:52,319
This must be a joke.

2037
02:34:52,319 --> 02:34:56,389
If I did not know any better, I'd say you were in a coma.

2038
02:34:56,389 --> 02:34:57,389
Huh?

2039
02:34:57,389 --> 02:34:58,389
I'm asleep.

2040
02:34:58,389 --> 02:34:59,389
Hmm.

2041
02:34:59,389 --> 02:35:00,389
Tira was just a dream, I guess.

2042
02:35:00,389 --> 02:35:01,389
That dream seems so real, though.

2043
02:35:01,389 --> 02:35:04,590
I thought, I mean, I liked, uh...

2044
02:35:04,590 --> 02:35:05,590
Hmm.

2045
02:35:05,590 --> 02:35:07,790
Pillow.

2046
02:35:07,790 --> 02:35:08,790
Would you wake up, please?

2047
02:35:08,790 --> 02:35:15,399
I didn't shoot the sheriff, I swear.

2048
02:35:15,399 --> 02:35:16,399
Oh, Tira.

2049
02:35:16,399 --> 02:35:17,399
Morning.

2050
02:35:17,399 --> 02:35:19,709
You're still half asleep, I suspect.

2051
02:35:19,709 --> 02:35:21,709
Reset, you are the proprietor of an item shop.

2052
02:35:21,709 --> 02:35:24,709
Now, you must learn to be responsible and not sleep the day away.

2053
02:35:24,709 --> 02:35:25,709
You're right.

2054
02:35:25,709 --> 02:35:26,709
I...

2055
02:35:26,709 --> 02:35:27,709
I don't remember.

2056
02:35:27,709 --> 02:35:31,399
You can't seemingly be awake and asleep at the same time.

2057
02:35:31,399 --> 02:35:34,399
It'd be a wonder if it did not fill me with blind, hopeless terror.

2058
02:35:34,399 --> 02:35:38,700
Yesterday, we paid our respects at the Merchants Guild and then briefly opened shop.

2059
02:35:38,700 --> 02:35:39,700
Have you already forgotten?

2060
02:35:39,700 --> 02:35:40,700
What do you mean, paid?

2061
02:35:40,700 --> 02:35:41,700
Is Lily dead?

2062
02:35:41,700 --> 02:35:45,159
From this day forth, we are now in business properly.

2063
02:35:45,159 --> 02:35:48,159
The way this is going, though, I fear for the future.

2064
02:35:48,159 --> 02:35:49,840
That's right.

2065
02:35:49,840 --> 02:35:50,840
We're in business.

2066
02:35:50,840 --> 02:35:53,340
By the name of heaven, are you smiling so much?

2067
02:35:53,340 --> 02:35:56,690
Oh, no reason.

2068
02:35:56,690 --> 02:35:58,690
I just think I saw something nice in my dreams.

2069
02:35:58,690 --> 02:36:01,120
Tira, let's give it our all.

2070
02:36:01,120 --> 02:36:05,299
Well, if you really are dedicated to making this work, wash yourself and meet me downstairs.

2071
02:36:05,299 --> 02:36:06,299
What day is it?

2072
02:36:06,299 --> 02:36:13,110
What?

2073
02:36:13,110 --> 02:36:25,229
You...

2074
02:36:25,229 --> 02:36:26,229
What?

2075
02:36:26,229 --> 02:36:33,239
So, I have an item shop and stuff and it's all cool and awesome.

2076
02:36:33,239 --> 02:36:35,239
So, what do I do now?

2077
02:36:35,239 --> 02:36:39,110
What?

2078
02:36:39,110 --> 02:36:43,760
Why am I getting this all over again?

2079
02:36:43,760 --> 02:36:53,159
Okay, we did this already.

2080
02:36:53,159 --> 02:37:00,799
You keep your levels and your stuff, but you don't keep money.

2081
02:37:00,799 --> 02:37:10,159
Oh, so you're supposed to lose.

2082
02:37:10,159 --> 02:37:24,209
Safe's coming, buy everything.

2083
02:37:24,209 --> 02:37:36,989
Did it go drop like $150,000?

2084
02:37:36,989 --> 02:37:43,940
Well, I'll at least be able to pay off the debt.

2085
02:37:43,940 --> 02:37:45,879
What about, like, event...

2086
02:37:45,879 --> 02:37:46,879
Hold on.

2087
02:37:46,879 --> 02:37:47,879
This is...

2088
02:37:47,879 --> 02:37:48,879
What about adventure guild shit?

2089
02:37:48,879 --> 02:37:53,709
Hold...

2090
02:37:53,709 --> 02:37:54,709
Wait a minute.

2091
02:37:54,709 --> 02:38:03,239
This is important.

2092
02:38:03,239 --> 02:38:04,239
Oh, shit.

2093
02:38:04,239 --> 02:38:06,440
I got to do this all over again?

2094
02:38:06,440 --> 02:38:07,440
Hold on.

2095
02:38:07,440 --> 02:38:19,049
Wait a minute.

2096
02:38:19,049 --> 02:38:20,049
I just want to see what happens.

2097
02:38:20,049 --> 02:38:21,049
Let me just see.

2098
02:38:21,049 --> 02:38:24,600
Let me check something here real quick.

2099
02:38:24,600 --> 02:38:31,719
I just want to see if this is possible.

2100
02:38:31,719 --> 02:38:35,399
Right here.

2101
02:38:35,399 --> 02:38:36,399
I just want to check something.

2102
02:38:36,399 --> 02:38:51,139
You keep everything but money.

2103
02:38:51,139 --> 02:38:52,139
I just...

2104
02:38:52,139 --> 02:38:53,139
I just want to see if this is possible.

2105
02:38:53,139 --> 02:38:59,500
Just out of curiosity.

2106
02:38:59,500 --> 02:39:51,940

2107
02:39:51,940 --> 02:39:55,040

2108
02:39:55,040 --> 02:39:59,159
Fuck.

2109
02:39:59,159 --> 02:40:00,649
Well, we're going to have to do it.

2110
02:40:00,649 --> 02:40:01,649
And I'm done.

2111
02:40:01,649 --> 02:40:02,649
I'm going to be ready this time.

2112
02:40:02,649 --> 02:40:06,260
God damn it.

2113
02:40:06,260 --> 02:40:07,260
$200,000.

2114
02:40:07,260 --> 02:40:08,260
I didn't even...

2115
02:40:08,260 --> 02:40:09,260
I couldn't even get it.

2116
02:40:09,260 --> 02:40:17,219
Open the store.

2117
02:40:17,219 --> 02:40:18,219
End the...

2118
02:40:18,219 --> 02:40:19,219
Let's go.

2119
02:40:19,219 --> 02:40:20,219
We're going to...

2120
02:40:20,219 --> 02:40:21,219
I'm not going to change the past.

2121
02:40:21,219 --> 02:40:28,959
Go back a few days?

2122
02:40:28,959 --> 02:40:30,780
Buy stuff?

2123
02:40:30,780 --> 02:40:31,780
Buy...

2124
02:40:31,780 --> 02:40:41,790
But that's cheating.

2125
02:40:41,790 --> 02:40:42,790
Who cares if it's cheating?

2126
02:40:42,790 --> 02:40:43,790
You want a bracelet?

2127
02:40:43,790 --> 02:40:45,600
Hold on.

2128
02:40:45,600 --> 02:40:48,909
I don't have any bracelets.

2129
02:40:48,909 --> 02:40:53,639
Am I above cheating?

2130
02:40:53,639 --> 02:40:57,780
I'll buy a few things, okay?

2131
02:40:57,780 --> 02:41:02,559
Watch me actually do it this time, somehow.

2132
02:41:02,559 --> 02:41:15,139
The interest rates on these loans are cheating.

2133
02:41:15,139 --> 02:41:16,139
Yeah, that's true.

2134
02:41:16,139 --> 02:41:24,739

2135
02:41:24,739 --> 02:41:25,739

2136
02:41:25,739 --> 02:41:26,739
I'm going to go buy the most expensive weapons.

2137
02:41:26,739 --> 02:41:32,309
Oh, your mom told you to come sell this.

2138
02:41:32,309 --> 02:41:33,309
No, thanks.

2139
02:41:33,309 --> 02:41:36,760
Yeah, that is tactical gaming.

2140
02:41:36,760 --> 02:41:37,760
You're right.

2141
02:41:37,760 --> 02:41:54,750
Get out of here.

2142
02:41:54,750 --> 02:42:02,379
The game's designed to kick this shit out of you in your first run.

2143
02:42:02,379 --> 02:42:04,379
You're supposed to optimize for the second run.

2144
02:42:04,379 --> 02:42:05,379
Okay.

2145
02:42:05,379 --> 02:42:06,379
Okay.

2146
02:42:06,379 --> 02:42:09,579
The price of weapons has decreased.

2147
02:42:09,579 --> 02:42:10,579

2148
02:42:10,579 --> 02:42:13,579

02:58:08,909 --> 02:58:18,219
i've learned since we've started this these rings never ever ever ever ever have increased in price

2275

this for like 90 i'll do 105 buy the other rings yeah the yam is for sale 2400 never thought about

2285
03:00:51,500 --> 03:01:00,840

2287
03:01:13,600 --> 03:01:25,600
near perfect level 11 i think i'm getting the hang of this when's the debt due i got look at

2288
03:01:25,600 --> 03:01:40,700
what's telling me for the debt all right what uh hold on in two days i need two food stuffs and

2306
03:05:13,610 --> 03:05:20,040
this is what i this everybody told me that this is like the way you do it that's the way i did it

2307
03:05:21,079 --> 03:05:43,370
all right here we go the letter the name of the game is literally resetter

2313
03:07:48,479 --> 03:07:56,239
this game came out like 10 years ago do you really think the dev is just hanging around twitch chats

2314
03:07:56,239 --> 03:08:33,069
now still you can do 120 now 115 what the hell is this golden pedestal i want it i think uh 48

2315
03:08:33,069 --> 03:08:48,430
percent is reasonable or 50 so something i'm realizing even if i didn't do the mr rissetti

03:08:48,430 --> 03:08:54,479
thing i'm getting more offers to have huge money that that that thing's like 20 grand

that

2384
03:24:26,399 --> 03:24:33,719
you know how data and things that are saved forever are interesting you know right i think

2385
03:24:33,719 --> 03:24:40,719
i've said that like it's just something that i say i don't know why i even when like the camera is

2386
03:24:40,719 --> 03:24:50,159
off i say that all the fucking time you know kim will will be able to tell you a story of how

2387
03:24:51,040 --> 03:24:55,840
um i think i've already told this story but sometimes i just get on something i just don't

2388
03:24:55,840 --> 03:25:03,520
get off after we watched infinity war i was just doing Thanos quotes alone i was making like

2389
03:25:03,520 --> 03:25:08,159
sandwiches and just be just would just talk as Thanos and say the same like four lines over and

2390
03:25:08,159 --> 03:25:25,159
over again i would just do it i don't know why because it just i i don't know it's just something

2391
03:25:25,159 --> 03:25:31,559
that i do sometimes but the reason why i bring this up is because i i've said that on stream so

2392
03:25:31,559 --> 03:25:37,559
many times you could probably make like a four or five minute video compilation of me doing

2393
03:25:38,520 --> 03:25:53,850
that game of thrones guy you probably could i've said it so many times

2394
03:26:02,600 --> 03:26:05,319
look what i'm doing it again

2395
03:26:10,989 --> 03:26:14,909

2399
03:26:51,520 --> 03:26:57,930

2400
03:26:57,930 --> 03:26:58,809
people would think it was good

2401
03:27:09,819 --> 03:27:14,860
oh you guys want something to something for dessert yeah what do you want ice cream ice cream would

2402

sherbert is fruit juice and milk sorbet okay um you got i almost just fucking ended the

2407
03:27:56,639 --> 03:27:59,360
fucking stream by no by exiting this

2408
03:28:05,469 --> 03:28:19,229
it's too easy what are those goggles it's too easy end of the stream argument

2409
03:28:19,309 --> 03:28:30,319
and sure but still though nobody gets i like sherbert but nobody ever has it okay there are

03:49:53,129 --> 03:50:09,760
it's pretty close i don't even know why you even asked that oh all right so let's expand the store

2769
04:49:48,669 --> 04:49:50,729
the pumpkins have a shitload of experience

2770
04:49:58,299 --> 04:50:06,599
i still need this lime liver i gotta go back and do it again there's too much there's so much to do

2771
04:50:06,599 --> 04:50:23,229
it's a little time in the day attack power doubled for everybody that's bad

2772
04:50:24,430 --> 04:50:26,430
that means if i get hit like twice i die

2773
04:50:33,069 --> 04:50:42,680
i can't i don't that was off screen that's some off-screen bullshit all right this same

2774
04:50:42,680 --> 04:50:59,119
shit happened to me last time i'm not gonna let that happen again he's losing he's losing

2775
04:50:59,119 --> 04:51:10,799

2776
04:51:12,400 --> 04:51:22,189
louis like 18 or 19 right something like that 20 20 right right right

2777
04:51:27,119 --> 04:51:29,840
by the way if i get hit by that it would have killed me instantly so good thing i

2778
04:51:29,840 --> 04:51:35,790
didn't get hit by it just eat the bread

2779
04:51:35,790 --> 04:51:54,040
70 damage that's pretty good uh i think i can get to 13 14 on the same floor

2780
04:51:54,040 --> 04:52:08,459
floor

2781
04:52:08,459 --> 04:52:27,720
almost probably get it here thanks to the free exp got it all right let's go just go

2782
04:52:35,790 --> 04:52:44,990
news defense power doubled for everyone all right so i got one more floor and then we're

2783
04:52:44,990 --> 04:52:50,110
probably gonna see a boss uh do i just go down i wonder if i should just try to fight the boss

2784
04:52:50,110 --> 04:52:58,639
with the items that i have yeah this is gonna be hell was this a cube eternal ice i don't want

2785
04:52:58,639 --> 04:53:13,099
to lose that that seems like a really good item i just got like the tesseract i don't think i'm

2786
04:53:13,099 --> 04:53:30,569
gonna lose it although i probably might i might be able to get to 15

2787
04:53:31,759 --> 04:53:42,080
it's very i don't know it might not be worth the risk i'll try everything takes forever to kill

2788
04:53:45,599 --> 04:53:48,080
i don't think that means more experience that just means harder to kill

2789
04:53:48,080 --> 04:53:59,819
okay

2790
04:54:05,180 --> 04:54:24,830
nice oh all right not bad i think i'm just gonna go

2791
04:54:27,470 --> 04:54:31,400
i think that's what's gonna happen i got pretty much full health on everything full

2792
04:54:31,400 --> 04:54:34,200
i want to deal with the defense shit after these guys i'm gonna go through

2938
05:28:54,520 --> 05:29:04,639
hold on do a thing i overheard some of the customers discussing rumor about someone near

2939
05:29:04,639 --> 05:29:11,310
the fountain attempting to sell overpriced items like what paintings and other objects

2940
05:29:11,310 --> 05:29:16,750
to art with hard to define value seemingly even then though the offer prices were apparently

2941
05:29:16,750 --> 05:29:22,590
absurd let there be a lesson always try to keep our prices realistic or people who begin to spread

2942
05:29:22,590 --> 05:29:27,950
rumors about us yeah art's tough to sell though indeed we should always be careful in stocking

2943
05:29:27,950 --> 05:29:36,860
paintings and the like new character hey you there uh can we help you you two look like you

2944
05:29:36,860 --> 05:29:44,159

2947
05:29:55,560 --> 05:30:00,919

2948
05:30:00,919 --> 05:30:05,400
your wall use them as pictures or perhaps i could interest you in something else i'm sure i have

2949
05:30:05,400 --> 05:30:11,450
something you'll just adore i don't know i don't know what's the asking price for one of these

2991
05:38:16,619 --> 05:38:20,380
chat is so predictable are they what do they say i'm not looking at it right now

2992
05:38:30,919 --> 05:38:32,040
turn the lookout oh no

2993
05:38:32,040 --> 05:38:45,709
well that's a like ten thousand dollars right there

2994
05:38:48,750 --> 05:38:49,950
he's wearing earpods

2995
05:38:58,560 --> 05:39:12,590
that really is that i don't think that level would not be funny ow what's this water crystal

2996
05:39:20,270 --> 05:39:26,349
slime fluid no i don't need that shit

2997
05:39:31,979 --> 05:39:34,619
oh parade helm all right this is worth money

2998
05:39:42,830 --> 05:39:49,770
17 almost what's that i can work with it

2999
05:39:49,770 --> 05:40:02,200
the exp sound is driving me insane this is kind of grating isn't it

3000
05:40:07,000 --> 05:40:08,840
what is hitting me what the hell was that

3001
05:40:21,310 --> 05:40:23,630
so is there i'm gonna assume this probably only 15

3002
05:40:34,799 --> 05:40:40,939
total whoa that's what happens when you look at chat glad i only took

3003
05:40:42,700 --> 05:40:49,150
a small amount of damage because that would have been bad trying to go too fast i have a lot of

3004
05:40:49,150 --> 05:40:53,630
confidence right now which is bad you never want to feel confident in a game like this you always

3005
05:40:53,630 --> 05:41:00,090
want to be nervous fighting your nails and scared up around every single corner

3006
05:41:04,490 --> 05:41:15,689
fish cookie it'll be funny if he walked off the edge ha ha i would donate two thousand bits

3007
05:41:15,689 --> 05:41:24,330
you can't even walk off the edge i'm stuck here you can't walk off the edge it doesn't work like

3008
05:41:24,330 --> 05:41:37,549
that

3009
05:41:47,040 --> 05:41:50,939
what time is it right now we're getting to those late hours aren't we

3010
05:41:52,220 --> 05:42:01,229
around what midnight eastern i'm still good to go i'm in this for the long haul tonight

3011
05:42:02,750 --> 05:42:03,389
i need to know

3012
05:42:11,340 --> 05:42:15,419
i just need to know what happens after 200 i just took 55 damage without just have

3013
05:42:26,139 --> 05:42:28,700
i know i'm about to level up but i'm scared to get like double tap and die

3014
05:42:38,430 --> 05:42:40,330
i'll forget it

3015
05:42:43,580 --> 05:42:45,580
i'm gonna hydrate and eat i've already eaten tonight

3016
05:42:45,979 --> 05:42:51,259
so right before the stream started i ate a full meal so i'll be good for a little while

3017
05:42:51,259 --> 05:43:05,560
i'll be good for like another few hours

3018
05:43:07,080 --> 05:43:11,799
pretty good i'm just gonna go i'll try to get to the boss

3019
05:43:15,689 --> 05:43:16,409
that's the next floor

3020
05:43:19,849 --> 05:43:24,409
and then it's all about the slime i'm gonna just do boss rush get the slime

3021
05:43:26,560 --> 05:43:33,770
if i can progress that part of the game

3022
05:43:51,130 --> 05:44:09,040
all right so now they're pretty much the same level one more okay uh no not yet

3023
05:44:09,680 --> 05:44:12,840
i can probably get to 19 before fighting the boss

3024
05:44:25,000 --> 05:44:29,900
he's so addicted well yeah come on

3025
05:44:31,900 --> 05:44:38,439
it was last time i was addicted to a game and i wanted to do it for like more than a couple

3026
05:44:38,439 --> 05:44:52,599
streams

3027
05:45:00,250 --> 05:45:12,939
don't let him play animal crossing yeah but that's just as fun i am a sucker for games with

3028
05:45:13,659 --> 05:45:22,729
just slow drip trickling upgrades that's just does it doesn't fool me the gauntlet nobody here

3029
05:45:22,729 --> 05:45:25,119
but us what do you mean the gauntlet

3030
05:45:33,479 --> 05:45:40,139
holy shit okay this is not a boss i just dump a bunch of enemies at you my god

3031
05:45:43,819 --> 05:46:00,250
pretty good move to have here though more it is called the gauntlet yeah oh fuck

3032
05:46:04,040 --> 05:46:05,319
too many too many

3033
05:46:05,319 --> 05:46:11,919

3040
05:47:48,970 --> 05:47:55,450
no no i don't need the bat wings i don't know i don't need them but they might be worth more

3041
05:47:55,450 --> 05:48:01,159

3061
05:56:26,720 --> 05:56:54,279
12 000 price gouger combo come on 15 almost there one more sale run an errand

3062
05:56:56,119 --> 05:57:08,009
110 what do i get at 15 the vending machine do you have my food stuffs

3063
05:57:08,650 --> 05:57:18,759
i do welcome back let me get rid of these peach tins that i bought too many of during the boom

3064
05:57:19,560 --> 05:57:34,889
i'm 26 you'll do it nice all right now let's put the vending machine in a moment if you will

3065
05:57:35,689 --> 05:57:40,750
no quite well i simply thought it was time to explain how to place and use vending machines

3066
05:57:41,709 --> 05:57:46,409
vending machines allow you to sell a larger volume of items in a shorter amount of time

3067
05:57:46,409 --> 05:57:53,520
compared to handling each customer yourself okay to place a vending machine choose the vending

3068
05:57:53,520 --> 05:57:58,720
machine from the item placement menu at the counter as if it were a normal item the counter

3069
05:57:58,720 --> 05:58:05,000
will become that vending machine and after i put it down it just starts selling stuff

3070
05:58:07,819 --> 05:58:11,340
no you'll have to keep the machine stocked yourself there is a limit to how much you can

3071
05:58:11,340 --> 05:58:18,639
place in a vending machine as well so be mindful of what you put inside okay there's a downside

3072
05:58:18,639 --> 05:58:23,360
however because the vending machine is automatic the price of an item sold from a vending machine

3073
05:58:23,360 --> 05:58:34,439
can not be negotiated items will sell for their base price keep that in mind all right it is a

3074
05:58:34,439 --> 05:58:40,889
drawback the extra volume can often make up for the lower price however so far cheap items a

3075
05:58:40,889 --> 05:58:49,529
vending machine is helpful i'm just gonna get like four of them finally remember that we cannot sell

3076
05:58:49,529 --> 05:58:54,330
off the machines ourselves if you wish to dispose of a machine we must sell it back to the merchant

3077
05:58:54,330 --> 05:59:02,990
skilled or market at a steep loss keep that in mind if you decide to invest in one all right

3078
05:59:02,990 --> 05:59:09,360
well let's get it over here what should i put in it i think i think i want it like right here right

3079
05:59:09,360 --> 05:59:27,880
in the front door right there or right here right at the end i think right in the front door peach

3080
05:59:27,880 --> 05:59:42,779
tins yams uh i think i could probably just stock up on peach tin i'm gonna put it right here

3081
05:59:44,139 --> 06:00:12,889
where is it old vendor whoa it's the whole thing what uh okay is it two this is like the apple

3082
06:00:12,889 --> 06:00:28,169
machine and like chocolate and fish do cheap stuff cheap shit well what if it just automatically

3083
06:00:28,169 --> 06:00:43,290
sells these for me i think that's worth it for me peach tins won't sell in there what about like

3084
06:00:43,290 --> 06:00:56,840
raincoats this is for getting rid of just cheap shit all right well i don't really have that much

06:10:36,669 --> 06:10:40,680
don't sell weapons in your store

3135
06:10:42,840 --> 06:10:50,380
adventurers will ask for weapons yeah i've noticed that too they kind of just come in

3136
06:10:50,380 --> 06:11:00,970
and they say hey do you have this don't forget it actually you know

3137
06:11:06,889 --> 06:11:09,130
it's free experience why not take it right

3138
06:11:16,159 --> 06:11:27,209
worthless yeah and i can't just lend them the weapons too but in a perfect world they come in

3139
06:11:27,209 --> 06:11:32,250
and ask for it or they want to buy it so then not only do you don't have to equip it on every time

3140
06:11:32,250 --> 06:11:38,970
but they also pay you for it it is a perfect scenario there

3141

3181
06:19:19,740 --> 06:19:31,790
have you heard heard about what a while ago there was a coup d'etat in a certain kingdom

3182
06:19:33,759 --> 06:19:38,240
what aren't you interested even a little bit oh whatever anyway the king of that land was

3183
06:19:38,240 --> 06:19:42,319
actually pretty popular so many people have speculated that the coup was orchestrated by

3184
06:19:42,319 --> 06:19:49,209
a rival kingdom and out the people now here's where it gets interesting that king had a daughter and

3185
06:19:49,209 --> 06:19:53,930
after the coup she just disappeared the nobility of that realm are searching for her in order to

3186
06:19:53,930 --> 06:19:58,889
raise her up as their new queen and seize control again it's me they're quite desperate that kingdom's

3187
06:19:58,889 --> 06:20:05,439
troubles are just starting mark my words is that so you really aren't interested in this at all are

3188
06:20:05,439 --> 06:20:11,610
you why don't you care well it just feels like it's so far away you know like it could never be me

3189
06:20:11,610 --> 06:20:18,080
you're not talking about me it's above the clouds or something why should it matter to me i just own

3190
06:20:18,080 --> 06:20:25,500
a store and i've debt this is why you'll always be small time what's my being short got to do with

3191
06:20:25,580 --> 06:20:31,580
this listen reset a good merchant knows how to gather information from around the world

3192
06:20:31,580 --> 06:20:36,189
understand what it means and put it to good use even things that seem trivial can be important

3193
06:20:36,189 --> 06:20:40,590
in the long run therefore the best merchants make it to their job they get the job to gather from

3194
06:20:40,590 --> 06:20:45,389
across the news in the world they go to all the reddits every one of them they go to reddit news

3195
06:20:45,389 --> 06:20:52,650
they go to reddit interesting gifts they go to reddit earth they go to they get they get their

3196
06:20:52,650 --> 06:20:59,130
news and they get their information from all over the world okay i guess that makes sense thanks

3289

3293
06:43:06,880 --> 06:43:19,709
welcome to oh great good day you seem to be longing about as usual well that's not true

3294
06:43:19,709 --> 06:43:26,189
i'm really very very busy even if i do have my feet up on the counter right putting that aside

3295
06:43:26,189 --> 06:43:30,430
for a moment i assume you've heard about the recent issues concerning trade of items deemed

3296
06:43:30,430 --> 06:43:41,659
by the chapel masters to be magical typical i have heard about that the chapel masters have

3297
06:43:41,659 --> 06:43:45,979
been seizing items that they claim have a corrupting influence on man's immortal soul

3298
06:43:46,700 --> 06:43:54,970
i believe the claim was yeah spot on just that i'd expect to view madame fairy hey anyway it's all

3299
06:43:54,970 --> 06:44:01,950
a super bad califragilisticexpialidocious nonsense interestingly though the items that

3300
06:44:01,950 --> 06:44:06,270
the chapel gathers for a destruction a lot of them are turning up in the dungeons and i mean

3301
06:44:06,270 --> 06:44:16,169
a lot well why very good question the dungeons have always been packed with mysterious

3302
06:44:17,209 --> 06:44:23,229
mysteries however so it may not be worth thinking about too hard it does however present an

3303
06:44:23,229 --> 06:44:31,529
opportunity which leads me to a guild card oh you want us to give the items back to the chapel

3304
06:44:31,529 --> 06:44:41,369
masters how can you be so dense and still be capable of breathing dense uh like a chocolate

3305
06:44:41,369 --> 06:44:47,209
cake i want to make sure that these items return to general circulation the chapel masters are

3306
06:44:47,209 --> 06:44:52,889
standing astride curiosity and knowledge and i won't have it if you help me you can recover

3307
06:44:52,889 --> 06:44:59,950
some of these to sell while i lay hands on other things for study the chapel masters won't try to

3308
06:44:59,950 --> 06:45:07,630
seize property from a spec to a secular shop so you would have nothing to worry about of course

3309
06:45:07,709 --> 06:45:11,709
the merchants guild is a jurisdiction over the behavior of the city's merchants

3310
06:45:11,709 --> 06:45:20,000
and the guild master would never cede authority to anyone so so they can't touch us aren't city

3311
06:45:20,000 --> 06:45:26,599
politics wonderfully headache-inducing regardless madame fairy you provide the material support i

3312
06:45:26,599 --> 06:45:32,439
provide the quite literal firepower we go into a dungeon together and get what we need agreed

3313
06:45:33,560 --> 06:45:37,720
well we'll pay the adventure fee for sure but you'll have to buy what we find here

3314
06:45:37,720 --> 06:45:47,099
in the shop just like everybody else oh man you gotta be uh well yeah that's acceptable

3315
06:45:47,740 --> 06:45:50,860
i'm looking forward to seeing you in action i expect a lot mr magician

3316
06:45:52,060 --> 06:46:00,090
you hardly need to worry on that front miss counter jockey make sure you can identify everything

3342
06:50:43,450 --> 06:50:49,709

06:51:02,110 --> 06:51:08,909
right after wiping the cat fugue off my face and i go back on top i'm sitting the cat has moved

3346
06:51:08,909 --> 06:51:13,799
over to the end of the branch by now so by the time the cat is sitting on the end of the branch

3347
06:51:13,799 --> 06:51:17,560
i'm just like don't jump up please don't do that like i'm trying my hardest to save you

3350
06:51:46,959 --> 06:51:55,470

3351
06:51:55,470 --> 06:51:59,549
on the edge you've got a bird sitting there and the cat now has the attention on the bird

3352
06:51:59,549 --> 06:52:05,470
so the bird is the bird is like is squawking at the cat at this point and then they're moving

3359
06:52:43,209 --> 06:52:50,650
and i'm stuck in the tree now trying to save this bird and save this cat and the fireman has a big

3360
06:52:50,650 --> 06:52:57,130
megaphone hey can you get down from there son and i'm sitting like oh yeah what the heck am i going

3365
06:53:25,290 --> 06:53:32,220

3765
08:32:46,680 --> 08:32:49,560
or

3766
08:32:51,400 --> 08:32:52,360
i thought that was a ham

3767
08:32:56,520 --> 08:32:57,240
well i leveled up

3768
08:33:01,560 --> 08:33:11,340
now run eight and a half hours and we're still fine this ain't even close to my like all-time

3769
08:33:11,340 --> 08:33:20,880
high stream got a long way to go my longest stream was like 13 hours or something this is like eight

3770
08:33:20,880 --> 08:33:41,529
and a half yeah now typically i sit somewhere between like six and seven and a half not today

3771
08:33:51,319 --> 08:33:53,000
simpson's hitting around that was it wasn't that 11

3772
08:33:55,639 --> 08:34:00,759
how long was simpson hit was it was that actually i thought it was that um lifeline game

3773
08:34:01,560 --> 08:34:04,599
so

3774
08:34:08,520 --> 08:34:48,540
stop floors are so huge look at how big this is this is massive this is so big break the record i

3775
08:34:48,540 --> 08:34:56,080
don't think i would even if i did i'm gonna do i'm gonna beat the debt even if i did that that i'm

3776
08:34:56,080 --> 08:35:02,810
assuming like another probably 45 minutes to an hour we're not gonna come even close to the record

3777
08:35:03,450 --> 08:35:19,500
here we go i think i'm gonna try to level up one more time here

3778
08:35:24,349 --> 08:35:29,040
probably worth it considering this is probably one of the last boss areas

3779
08:35:30,720 --> 08:35:38,520
for the death storyline i could be wrong i'm not even gonna attack the fire guys just guaranteed

3780
08:35:38,520 --> 08:35:42,279
death

3781
08:35:47,500 --> 08:35:52,299
oh what's this cutlet bowl i love chicken cutlets

3782
08:35:54,459 --> 08:35:57,419
they knew there's like my favorite food on earth and they're just taunting me with it now

3783
08:35:57,419 --> 08:36:14,090
i like cold chicken cutlets

3784
08:36:16,169 --> 08:36:17,930
i'm not even i don't think that's even a weird thing to say

3785
08:36:26,330 --> 08:36:29,529
cooked um you cook them you bread them you cook them you fry them up

3786
08:36:30,250 --> 08:36:34,970
and then you put them in the fridge and eat them cold like a sandwich

3787
08:36:35,930 --> 08:36:42,970
a little bit of mayonnaise a little bit of uh like swiss cheese maybe and i knew i didn't

3788
08:36:42,970 --> 08:36:47,520
want to touch any chest and this is the number one reason why this is the reason you're looking at

3789
08:36:47,520 --> 08:37:06,319
right now that's why i didn't want to even touch one what am i gonna eat my options are gonna be

3790
08:37:06,319 --> 08:37:23,049
pretty limited in like an hour or so no fire guys right all right just kill the pumpkin and

3791
08:37:23,049 --> 08:37:32,250
i can level up level up all right this is it i need to pay attention here because

3792
08:37:34,330 --> 08:37:41,759
i'm only gonna get one shot at this so this is it for the night two fire guys just avoid them

3793
08:37:42,720 --> 08:37:51,340
what if it blocks is in here this is the last shot until i've erased the debt

3794
08:37:58,729 --> 08:38:22,220
uh too much go around of course all right here we go it's double slime double slime

3795
08:38:22,380 --> 08:38:31,439
so

3796
08:38:37,819 --> 08:38:46,110

3797
08:38:54,400 --> 08:38:57,119

4053
09:47:11,339 --> 09:47:17,419
this very moment without questioning me once i do not understand it even now how are you capable

4054
09:47:17,419 --> 09:47:27,279
of such casual trust how can you be so ceaselessly positive about things um well um i don't know i

4055
09:47:27,279 --> 09:47:31,599

4056
09:47:31,599 --> 09:47:35,760
to open an item store to pay off the debt all i could think was that sounds like a lot of fun

4094
09:54:47,720 --> 09:55:02,059
mind you let's go back oh my god and so our days of running an item shop continue

4095
09:55:09,449 --> 09:55:15,839
oh i got the true card what that we're out what are we doing so you managed to pay off the loan

4096
09:55:15,839 --> 09:55:22,400
shark fairies debt have you well i suppose some congratulations are in order still i would expect

4097
09:55:22,400 --> 09:55:30,089
any common proletarian to have the holy basic skills needed to get this far and now for part

4098
09:55:30,169 --> 09:55:39,449
two the elegant graceful tale of alouette yeah like egs is interested in making that happen

4099
09:55:41,120 --> 09:55:44,800
what did you just say calm down they say you don't need to get this worked up over it more

4100
09:55:44,800 --> 09:55:51,769
importantly please just do the explanation right here's this one i don't see why of all the people

4101
09:55:51,769 --> 09:55:59,069
have to look here misters fine fine fine if i must okay well then without further ado allow me to

4102
09:55:59,069 --> 09:56:06,910
explain post game content or enjoying the game after beating it all right that's better to start

4103
09:56:06,910 --> 09:56:11,629
with if you load the game you're about to save you will begin endless mode where you can play

4104
09:56:11,629 --> 09:56:18,029
as long as you like without having to worry about any debts you may work as a common shopkeeper to

4105
09:56:18,029 --> 09:56:24,279
your heart's delight and you know there just might maybe possibly be some items and dungeons

4106
09:56:24,279 --> 09:56:29,000
and stuff that you haven't seen before in addition you have now unlocked new game plus and the

4107
09:56:29,000 --> 09:56:33,959
survival mode you start over again a new game plus but you choose a save and keep all the items

4108
09:56:33,959 --> 09:56:38,430
and levels from that save remember that you've got to pay off the debt from the beginning again

4109
09:56:38,430 --> 09:56:43,309
though survival mode is a nasty business where you keep paying back debt every single week until

4110
09:56:43,309 --> 09:56:50,190
it overwhelms you how long can you last against weeks of six digit payments i wonder especially

4111
09:56:50,190 --> 09:56:55,709
in that ridiculous survival hell mode you might have picked up a true card from an adventurer

4112
09:56:56,349 --> 09:57:00,349
you only get that from an adventurer you're really close to but if you have that you can hire them

4113
09:57:00,349 --> 09:57:07,610
from the start in these new modes anyway that should about do it really a proper player won't

4114
09:57:07,610 --> 09:57:12,330
be satisfied beating the game just once at the very least aim to fill out the entire item encyclopedia

4115
09:57:13,449 --> 09:57:25,360
pardon me see you guys enjoy the rest of the game okay let's go let's just make a new save

4116
09:57:30,519 --> 09:58:02,860
save okay how many do overwrite no how do i get out of this i made it okay well that's a lot

4117
09:58:02,860 --> 09:58:09,019
