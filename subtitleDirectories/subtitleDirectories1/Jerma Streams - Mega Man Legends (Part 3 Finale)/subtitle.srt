1
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:21,210
I never left. I've been here for two fucking straight hours. Just listening.

2
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:38,280
I feel pretty good. Didn't move. Hey, welcome back everybody. Welcome back. Tell us the bad

3
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,119
news. What bad news? Did I tweet that under somebody? I always think I fucking do that,

4
00:00:42,119 --> 00:01:00,200
I don't know why. I never left. How'd it go? It was good. It was good. He got brain fluid poisoning.

5
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:12,099
Yeah, we're gonna finish up this stream part two. I have probably an hour or two left of

6
00:01:12,099 --> 00:01:16,900
Mega Man Legends and that's where we're gonna call it. I don't want to play this tomorrow.

7
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:23,239
Black and White 2 is tomorrow. Let's finish this today. Let's get this done. You know what I'm

8
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:35,239
saying? Why can I not connect to chat? I just had it. All right, hold on. Can I? Is everybody

9
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:52,099
else's chat messed? Everybody else's chat messed up? Can you see this? Well, I got you guys on

10
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:55,620
another monitor anyways. All right, I can see you guys now. I just can't see you in the window I

11
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:05,459
usually see you in. All right, so what we're doing, I had, I was doing, I got the final key

12
00:02:06,579 --> 00:02:14,389
and then I saved it here. I beat the boss. Do the other games in the TV studio. I already aced the

13
00:02:14,389 --> 00:02:18,710
other games in the TV studio. I got all the parts from it too. All right, what do I want to do?

14
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:23,860
Go get the red lipstick at the Apple market to give to the artist in Uptown.

15
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:42,169
You got it. That's, I need to go east and then south. Yeah, I didn't know if it was going to

16
00:02:42,169 --> 00:02:48,889
take another hour or so, but it didn't. I'm back now. We can get this done now. All right,

17
00:02:48,889 --> 00:02:57,900
I need to get to the Apple market. Now we go south. That's west. Was that north or west?

18
00:02:58,699 --> 00:03:05,479
Yeah, I talked to the artist before. I said, I told the artist that they don't have any talent.

19
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:13,349
Is that bad? Does that lock me out? What about that, the pie, the race? All right, did it.

20
00:03:13,909 --> 00:03:31,270
I aced it. You must have left early. I aced it. All right, who has red lipstick? You? Once this

21
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:38,360
is all up with, we'll give you a special deal. All the bread you can eat. Oh, there's a bakery.

22
00:03:42,439 --> 00:04:00,120
Who has lipstick? Electric goods? Toy store? In here? Wait, why can't, get out of my way.

23
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:04,120
The grocer's wife still hasn't come back yet. I wonder if she's all right.

24
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:13,979
Sourdough lipstick. Mega Man, I'm frightened. Can you stay here and protect me? Oh, I know you've got

25
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:22,500
to protect everyone, not just me. You can see yourself in the mirror. Maybe not as handsome as

26
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,620
some, but it's a good looking face. You feel a little more confident after looking at yourself.

27
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:34,759
Plus two attack. Imagine. On second thought, I'll keep the clothes I got. I mean, after all,

28
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:38,439
they were present, right? I wouldn't want to hurt my boyfriend's feelings.

29
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:55,930
All right, nothing in here. Talk to the clerk. Stare into the mirror. Oh, Mega Man, I'm so

30
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:05,899
frightened. Where do I get the lipstick? In the electronics store. I see you got a VCR fridge.

31
00:05:05,899 --> 00:05:20,300
How much is the lipstick? Right here? I'm praying to God and my dead husband to watch over you

32
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:40,490
and protect this island. It's supposed to be that cashier in hip bone. What the heck? I need to

33
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:44,009
talk to the painter. Didn't I already? Remember? I was like, you have no talent. Oh, I could really

34
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:57,029
use some red. And I was like, yeah, you could. Yeah, I did. I talked to the artist like two times.

35
00:05:57,029 --> 00:06:15,420
Do it again. I guess we're doing it again. What are you saying? I have to try another. Okay.

36
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:40,970
He's actually back. Yeah. What do you think? I was lying. You think I wasn't going to come back?

37
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:50,500
Nah, guys. Hey, I'll be back in a couple hours, two or three hours. No, just I'm not coming back

38
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,819
and I'm not going to finish Mega Man Legends. It's going to go unfinished forever.

39
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:07,060
We already did this. Remember some talent, some red.

40
00:07:19,129 --> 00:07:27,750
Now we go talk to cashier. What's my thoughts on PB&J sandwiches? Disgusting. Get rid of them.

41
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:32,709
Gross. Replace the jelly with fluff. And then you've got, now you've got a believer out of me.

42
00:07:33,269 --> 00:07:55,019
PB&J. No, no, no, no, PB and fluff hog. Sorry. What? What is that? Really? I thought, I thought,

43
00:07:55,019 --> 00:07:57,819
I thought jelly was, I thought people didn't like, I thought a jelly was a,

44
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:08,410
well, I actually, I did just say disgusting. Didn't I? Yeah. That's not fair. Hey, William,

45
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:14,089
thanks for the five community subs, William. I didn't rebuild. No, I haven't rebuilt anything.

46
00:08:14,089 --> 00:08:21,639
I have. All right. Okay. I've got $76,000. Should I rebuild some stuff? I think it's time.

47
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:37,340
Where do I go to? City hall? Who rebuilds stuff? Rebuild the town. But that's money that I can't

48
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:44,250
spend on me. I know that sounds fucking horrible, but you know what I mean? I need to be able to,

49
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:57,100
artist is the museum lady. Oh, well, let's, first of all, let's go get the red lipstick.

50
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:27,190
That's priority number one. I will only gift to this stream. I will never subscribe myself

51
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:36,490
because your content is so far. What? Why would you pay more money to a stream that you don't like?

52
00:09:37,129 --> 00:09:48,870
What? That was the most, that doesn't fit in any logic. It's a power play.

53
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:58,980
I don't really like this stream, but I'm going to pay extra money to it. Hi there, Mega Man. Are

54
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:04,019
you looking for something? Yes. Red chalk for drawing. I didn't know you were an artist.

55
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:14,019
We don't have any red chalk, but I've got some red lipstick. Yes, give it to me. I'll give you mine.

56
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:20,279
Hey, Super Bruce. Thanks for the five community subs. Thank you, Super Bruce.

57
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:30,470
Glad I can help you see you later. Okay, got lipstick. Let's go give lipstick to lady. Here

58
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:39,720
we go. That's right. Where's the hype train? I turned off hype train. They don't exist anymore.

59
00:10:45,289 --> 00:11:05,909
I don't, they don't exist, but imagine subbing to Jerma. Can you imagine? What do I find? Downtown,

60
00:11:05,909 --> 00:11:20,970
uptown, uptown is to the left. Downtown is to the right. Oh no, twist. Can you imagine giving this

61
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:30,120
guy any money? He's a fucking stupid fucking goddamn fucking idiot. All right. I got red

62
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:37,669
lipstick for you. I thought I was going to get hit by that car. No, if I got hit by a car,

63
00:11:37,669 --> 00:11:50,340
I'd have to get 500,000 subs. Do you think I'm going to get hit by a car right now? Look what I

64
00:11:50,340 --> 00:12:04,500
have. I feel like I'm watching something on TV that's designed for like a one-year-old.

65
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:11,700
The way that she's talking. That's exactly what it needed. Thank you so much.

66
00:12:13,669 --> 00:12:20,899
Oh, would you look at the time? I better be going. Hey, don't get hit by the car.

67
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:35,539
Wait, what? What just happened? What did I do? I didn't, I didn't get anything for that. All

68
00:12:35,539 --> 00:12:41,399
right. She's gone. So now go to the museum. The museum doesn't exist. I have to rebuild it.

69
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:55,769
So I have to go to city hall, right? So I got to go east, north. It's that building right here.

70
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:03,990
This one? Wait, this one right, right here? This is the museum? This is the museum. No, this is the

71
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:21,220
doctor's office. Come on with the green woof. Uh, sorry. That's, that's K-T-O-X-T-V. This one. Oh,

72
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:27,860
this is the one that was closed. Oh, so she works here now. Okay. So that's why she had to leave

73
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:34,279
because now she works here. Does this place have a door? I tried to go in here before and it was

74
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:46,899
like, sorry, we're closed. Good afternoon. Welcome to the catalogs art museum. The first floor has

75
00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:56,360
our art gallery and the second floor is our exhibition hall. Please take your time and enjoy.

76
00:14:02,169 --> 00:14:12,139
That painting was made almost 20 years ago. It's beautiful, isn't it? It's all right. It looks like

77
00:14:12,139 --> 00:14:22,940
some thing out of an sci-fi movie, doesn't it? Yeah, it's all right. This painting was apparently

78
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:28,940
found in a ruin somewhere. It looks like a person wearing blue armor is fighting with a frightening

79
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:34,700
monster. I wonder what the thing that looks like an eye there is supposed to be symbolizing.

80
00:14:38,659 --> 00:14:44,169
It's all right. What do you think about this? Doesn't it feel like this painting is trying

81
00:14:44,169 --> 00:15:01,480
to tell us something? Is it a warning or a prediction? What is this? Fire in the streets?

82
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:08,470
This is a painting of the marketplace. Oh, I thought this was like lava destroying a town.

83
00:15:11,429 --> 00:15:20,460
Oh, all right. That one, that's all right. I wonder what that is. I don't know for sure myself.

84
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:29,700
I don't know either. What is this? This is a, that's a picture of our home catalogs.

85
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:37,139
Island as seen from the air. Let's go upstairs. Do I have to pay for a ticket or can I just go

86
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:46,539
upstairs? You don't have to pay to go to a museum, do you? No. They're all free, aren't they?

87
00:15:48,820 --> 00:16:02,149
Wait, hold on. Aren't all the museums and most of them are free? Yeah, depends. Oh, it's you.

88
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,100
You hanging it up downstairs?

89
00:16:28,419 --> 00:16:30,179
Could you bring it here and show it to me?

90
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:33,860
Do I have anything interesting? If it's really good, I could display it here.

91
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:42,490
You will? Great, thanks. I just got signed up. I just, all right, I just went to a gym on a trial

92
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:58,629
and now I go to this gym apparently. But there, it looks like a bone or something. Bone? Oh well,

93
00:16:58,629 --> 00:17:04,630
a lot of the people who come here are into strange things like this. It doesn't look like much,

94
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:08,390
but is it a dinosaur bone? That's really cool. All right, I'll just play it.

95
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:16,069
You could call it a bone. How about you call it a, a bone from a living creature,

96
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:30,259
not ancient digging tool. I got more stuff.

97
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,460
No.

98
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,420
Maybe, hey, maybe you've seen some rich people. What do you think I got it?

99
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:59,400
If I have one of these, how come you don't put me in that category of rich person? I have one

100
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,160
in my pocket. Doesn't that mean I'm more rich that I'm carrying the fucking thing around?

101
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:09,559
Thank you so much. I bet there are a lot of people who'll come to see this.

102
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:21,799
Anything else? Oh, is that a crystal fossil? All right, you guys pay big bucks for this one.

103
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:26,839
Those are made when a weaver bot's body crystallizes over the centuries.

104
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:33,799
They're considered grade three national treasures. That's right. It would mean so much to me if you'd

105
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:43,990
let me display that here, please. Thank you so much. I bet there are a lot of people who'll

106
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:50,069
come to see this. I bet there are a lot of people. Okay, so do I have any more rare artifacts?

107
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:59,420
Where did you find that? That's an antique shield. Wait, is she taking all my stuff?

108
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:04,940
National treasures. Some weaver bot was probably using it to protect itself.

109
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:12,859
Is she taking my shields and shit? This is my equipment, isn't it? Is it? Thank you so much.

110
00:19:16,619 --> 00:19:21,099
Oh, what's that you have on there? That blue armor looks really interesting. You found that.

111
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:29,339
Could I put it on display? You're a digger, right? If you find something interesting,

112
00:19:29,819 --> 00:19:36,619
there are a lot of people. Bring it here and show me. I'll evaluate it for you and if it's

113
00:19:36,619 --> 00:19:44,619
really nice, I'll put it on display here. This lady's talking into my soul. The way she's

114
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:58,180
talking is I can feel it. All right, what did I give? Don't you think this is just the loveliest

115
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:07,190
box? I really like these. Holy shit, you really were in desperate need of stuff. Look at this

116
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:14,789
cardboard box in the museum. Why is there a giant emerald? That's a beautiful diamond, isn't it?

117
00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:26,819
It's one of my favorite displays. That's a diamond, yet you want me to pay for the town.

118
00:20:26,819 --> 00:20:32,660
I have like $78,000. You have like $6 billion worth of diamond on the counter.

119
00:20:36,579 --> 00:20:43,740
You can't like shave off a little bit of this. Ancient digging tool discovered in the

120
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:53,619
Cardan forest subgate. Appears to be made of animal bone. Cool. What about this? Giant horn,

121
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:58,420
believed to be the horn bang of an animal-shaped reaverbot, often found in rocky areas above ground.

122
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:04,569
Antique shield, grade two national treasure, apparently used by reaverbots for protection.

123
00:21:04,569 --> 00:21:10,579
All right, this is my grade three. Grade three national treasure, fossilized remains of a dead

124
00:21:10,579 --> 00:21:19,259
reaverbot. All right, what's this? That may look like any old rock, but it's really a rare and

125
00:21:19,259 --> 00:21:30,259
valuable specimen. I'm missing some items? Oh well, we'll never get the end. Oh, that's cool.

126
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:45,740
Box and rock. Okay, so I got rid of some of those items. Now I need... why did I instinctively just

127
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:54,220
press triangle? Like I was going to get into the car. Third person, Grand Theft Auto, has just

128
00:21:54,220 --> 00:22:02,410
changed everything. You see a car, you try to get in it with triangle. All right, so I need to rebuild

129
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:08,569
the town, so I gotta go to the town hall, right? City hall. Now, can you just drive me to city hall?

130
00:22:15,109 --> 00:22:19,109
Mega Man gets into a car and drives to the grocery store ASMR.

131
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:42,809
Why ASMR? That's so stupid. All right, let's rebuild the town. I'll spend all my money. City hall.

132
00:22:43,529 --> 00:23:01,799
Excuse me, I have an appointment. How much does it cost? Hello there, Mega Man. What can I do for you?

133
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:10,380
I'd like to make a donation. You will? Oh, thank you so much. I wonder where we should start. Well,

134
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:15,589
let's start with the residential houses. To complete the repairs to the residential houses,

135
00:23:15,589 --> 00:23:25,099
we need an additional 18,000 zenny. How much do you want to donate? I'd like to give $18,000.

136
00:23:28,339 --> 00:23:39,799
Thank you. This means so much to the island. I'd like to donate to bring back the condominium.

137
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:54,490
5,300 for the condominiums. What a weird number. 5,380. Oh no, I gave $20 like seven and a half

138
00:23:54,490 --> 00:24:05,750
hours ago. I forgot. This means so much. All right, so how long does it take? Is that it? What can I

139
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:10,789
do for you? I'd like nothing, just came to see you. Oh my, why Mega Man? I'm happy to see you too.

140
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:26,700
I don't know quite what to say. Thank you. Okay, so did they do it? Does it take a while? Is this 20

141
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:42,890
year old video game logic? Are they just open? Let's go back to the market. I want to buy some

142
00:24:42,890 --> 00:25:03,589
stuff. Do the poggers or the kappa face. I don't know what that one is, so I know how to do this one.

143
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:22,619
That's not kappa. How do you, what, somebody do it. What is it? I'm not doing it right. Somebody,

144
00:25:22,619 --> 00:25:44,970
what is it? It's too small. I need to see it bigger. Is that right? It's kind of close.

145
00:25:50,069 --> 00:25:57,480
Do the Jim Carrey Grinch face. I don't have like $40,000 of prosthetics on. I don't know what you

146
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:04,019
want from me. What are you talking about? All right, what do I need to do? I need to go to

147
00:26:04,019 --> 00:26:19,109
the market. We're gonna buy a bunch of shit. Just hanging out with my 2,700 best friends

148
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:39,960
playing Mega Man Legends. We hate you. Parasocial relationship. What are you talking about? I'm here

149
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:59,380
with my best friends. Okay, defense. Extra pack. When does this max out? Shield repair. Repairs

150
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:11,740
damage life shield. Did I get another one? How many is this gonna have? Oh, buster unit, sniper

151
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:16,940
unit. All right, we're good. Now I have a ton of, let me make sure the canteen's refilled.

152
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:36,069
It's the Grinch face with no makeup. Holy shit. Oh my god. What the fuck? That's insane.

153
00:27:36,069 --> 00:27:45,779
That's actually ridiculous. Oh my god. It's just his face. Is that, is he, all right, is that movie

154
00:27:45,779 --> 00:28:03,500
any good? Show, I can't do that. Maybe I can. No, that's, that's like, I'm trying to like take a

155
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:17,420
shit in an airplane bathroom and I'm really anxious. That's what that was. Not even close.

156
00:28:17,819 --> 00:28:57,450
I'm sorry. Who emoted? Hold on. I can't. That's just the, that's the bitter beer face from the

157
00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:04,730
old beer commercials. Did you guys remember those commercials? The guy takes a sip out of the beer

158
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:10,410
and his face goes crazy. Just, all right, type in bitter beer face into YouTube and watch those

159
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:16,920
commercials. What, I don't even, I don't, okay, I know that joke, but I don't even know what beer it

160
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:29,460
was. No idea. Okay, let's pay attention for a second. I need to do, what is it, go to the

161
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:43,380
police station. Go to the police station and get a side quest. What's my favorite time zone?

162
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:57,740
The one that I currently live in because it's me existing in my own time. This one. I mean,

163
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:04,700
the one that I'm in. Why would I have a favorite time zone? Oh shit, I have to give 500,000 subs.

164
00:30:08,819 --> 00:30:17,720
All right, let's go. Oh look, they're doing it. See, look, they're rebuilding everything. Look at

165
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:33,849
this. It's going to be a nice new town. You guys have to eat a Post-it note. No, I'm in the doctors

166
00:30:33,849 --> 00:30:39,700
plenty enough. I'm not, I don't want to go in for anything else. All right, where's the police

167
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:58,299
station? Uptown? Is it Ikea houses? Where's the police? Where's the police? Where's the police?

168
00:30:58,299 --> 00:31:06,119
Where's the police? Police. Hospital. Is it downtown? Did I miss it? Police. Police. Police.

169
00:31:07,369 --> 00:31:24,329
Police. Downtown. Yeah, I gotta go back. And then north. That's two million dollars. That image is

170
00:31:24,329 --> 00:31:29,690
not even, that image is just, I'm not even gonna put that on stream. That's just like, I bought an

171
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:35,369
iPad seven years ago and that's what I do with it every time I turn it on. That's what that image is.

172
00:31:36,089 --> 00:32:11,740
Hounds rebuilding, yeah. All right, let's go. Police station. Oh, what the hell are you doing?

173
00:32:14,619 --> 00:32:21,420
All right, I feel like, oh god, let's get the shit out of me. I feel like, I feel like sometimes

174
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:25,660
somebody will post an image in here and they just went into Photoshop and hit the random button

175
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:42,359
and then they just hit save in the paste as soon as possible. Is there a randomized button in

176
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:49,400
Photoshop? Why the hell wouldn't they have done that? They're losing out on a lot of potential

177
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:58,299
subscribers to Adobe Photoshop. Will it, you know, take care of all the weird stuff?

178
00:32:58,859 --> 00:33:05,640
Give a job? I'm supposed to be out investigating everything that's been happening but I just can't

179
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:10,490
seem to get excited about work anymore. It's kind of, well, that's a little depressing, I guess.

180
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:21,829
Mega Man, isn't it? The inspector's inside. Go on in. All right, what do you got for me?

181
00:33:21,829 --> 00:33:29,269
We kind of reached the end of our rope with this last disaster. Things haven't completely quieted

182
00:33:29,269 --> 00:33:35,109
down yet, so we'll stay on alert status for a little while longer. When you have the time,

183
00:33:35,109 --> 00:33:39,670
stop by and talk to us sometime. Never know when we might need your help again.

184
00:33:43,339 --> 00:33:48,220
Oh, Mega Man, I was hoping you'd come by. There's something I'd like to ask your help with.

185
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:53,740
A little while ago, this little kid with a yellow face came up to me and told me that

186
00:33:54,299 --> 00:34:00,059
he dropped something downtown. I didn't really understand what he said to me. He said he dropped

187
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:05,430
three things and that we'd all better run with something. I'm not sure what it all means,

188
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:10,070
but I've got a hunch something's not right. Could you go check things out for me? What?

189
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:24,739
Thanks and good luck. What the fuck are you talking about? Wait, say that again? Okay, so

190
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:38,710
this guy, he's planting, uh, all right. It's fucked up. All right, let's go. Yeah,

191
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:42,309
this kid just did a bomb threat. I didn't really get it though. Yeah, what the fuck is he talking

192
00:34:42,309 --> 00:35:14,389
about? Uh, save before it's too late. I'm busy. What do you mean you're busy? What do you mean

193
00:35:14,389 --> 00:35:59,110
you're busy? He's just shit faced. Yeah, that's just, that's a guy that's just really, really

194
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:07,739
drunk. It's too late to go back. Where are these are? Where are the bombs? I'm sorry. I was not

195
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:31,980
paying very much attention. I was like downtown. This is the bad end. Bad end. How much did you

196
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:35,900
pay for this copy of the game? Um, I don't think it was that expensive. I think it's pretty cheap

197
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:43,849
actually. A bomb. That must be what the inspector was talking about. You've got to find the other

198
00:36:43,849 --> 00:36:55,159
two before they explode. Maybe if you can find someone who saw something. No. Did you see

199
00:36:55,159 --> 00:37:01,030
something? What was that noise? It sounded like a bomb going off. Wait, that means that the thing I

200
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:09,460
saw over by the greenhouse must have been. Oh no. Okay, greenhouse. This is a greenhouse, right?

201
00:37:10,179 --> 00:37:27,940
This is a greenhouse. Oh, this also is a greenhouse. Got it. You found a bomb. Mega Man,

202
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:36,739
here's the switch. There, now it's disarmed. Only one more. All right, we can find, excuse me,

203
00:37:36,739 --> 00:37:51,610
anybody? Anybody? You. What do you see? You see something? Are you looking for something?

204
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:57,050
You know, I lost something myself recently. I was fixing a roof and I forgot my tools

205
00:37:57,050 --> 00:38:03,130
on the roof of all places. Last place I thought of to look. Just goes to show you things are always

206
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:07,369
in the place you least expect to find them. Who knows? Maybe what you're looking for is on

207
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:11,050
somebody's roof. Is this the guy? Is this the, is this the person that put the bomb on the roof?

208
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:24,380
Why? That's very, very incredibly descriptive. All right, you get on the roof. But what roof?

209
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:48,420
There it is. Okay, it's on that roof. I see it. Okay, how do I get out? Can I jump? You. Is that it?

210
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:55,420
There's not, is there more than one? That's who? Didn't say there's one more. Is that it? Am I done?

211
00:38:56,139 --> 00:39:12,840
The music's still going. There's three bombs and one blew up. So that's it, right? I can leave.

212
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:25,639
The music's still, I think that's good. All right, let's go back and talk to the inspector again.

213
00:39:36,889 --> 00:39:45,159
I don't know, dude. I didn't play this game. Derma sucks at this game, though. Man, he sucks.

214
00:39:47,989 --> 00:40:07,750
That's, why'd you have to say it twice? Just to make sure you saw. Just wait that way. Just wait

215
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:23,239
that way. Derma sucks. Thanks to the five community subs. I did what you asked. Oh, it's you,

216
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:28,519
Mega Man. I saw the report about the bombs. We're lucky you found them all. Before they went off,

217
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:39,670
you saved the city again. Thanks for helping us. We're counting on you. We're counting on you.

218
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:56,980
All right, done. You stink. I love that picture of him. Hey, Mega Man. I could use your help with

219
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:02,340
something. A man came to us saying he's lost the money he was going to use to build his house.

220
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:09,380
Poor fellow. I'd like you to see if you can find the bag this fellow dropped. The owner of the bag

221
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:25,719
is out there in the lobby. You should go talk to him. You drop a bag? Reverb bots in underground

222
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:34,099
cities? Oh, that's a little out of my league. Where are you? What'd you drop? Bustard man. Oh,

223
00:41:34,099 --> 00:41:39,539
where could I have left it? I'm pretty sure I had it when I went to the electronic shop.

224
00:41:40,579 --> 00:41:45,940
I've been saving for years so I could build my dream house too. Oh, what am I going to do?

225
00:41:46,739 --> 00:42:16,860
Humans are animals. Yeah, that's true. Mammal to be exact. Yeah, we got a wink. I just saw it.

226
00:42:29,369 --> 00:42:41,719
Give me a free soda. Do I have a beard? No, I just I can't grow a beard. This turns into weird,

227
00:42:41,719 --> 00:42:50,599
gross strands of dark looking spaghetti on my face. All right, let's go to the

228
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:57,500
southern part. Why did I choose a wink as a thing? I don't know because

229
00:42:59,639 --> 00:43:03,239
channel points came out and that day I was like, oh, it's just a wink. Who cares?

230
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:09,780
And now it's turned into the biggest mistake I've ever done on Twitch. This has to be the

231
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:19,639
biggest mistake I've done on YouTube and Twitch combined. All right, electronics. The junk shop.

232
00:43:29,449 --> 00:43:39,079
Winx ruined his life. All right, what do you got? You left your bag here? Someone carrying a bag?

233
00:43:39,079 --> 00:43:43,880
Yeah, I saw him. He said he had lots of money so I tried to get him to buy something but he didn't

234
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:49,159
buy anything. He said that it wasn't his money to spend. He left saying he wasn't going to get

235
00:43:49,960 --> 00:44:11,219
something to eat. All right, so he went to the bakery. All right, he went to the bakery. Once

236
00:44:11,219 --> 00:44:19,670
this is all over with, we'll give you a snow. All right, where did he go? Over here? There are tomatoes,

237
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:34,380
cucumbers, and other vegetables. That's a fake link. Is there another like a restaurant? Not a

238
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:43,190
real link. I can see them. So where did he get food? Over here at this meat shop? Welcome, huh?

239
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:48,070
Middle-aged man carrying a bag. Well, he bought some bread and then left saying he had something

240
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:53,750
to look up. I don't think a single piece of bread will be enough of a meal for a grown man.

241
00:44:54,469 --> 00:45:11,539
Something he needed. Something he had to look up? Did he go to the library? Is there a library in

242
00:45:11,539 --> 00:45:30,010
the game? Have I been in a library? What building is it? Downtown? I went to the museum. All right,

243
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:46,150
library. Is this a library? This looks like a library. All right, library. A man carrying a

244
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:50,869
bag. Yes, I saw him. He looked like he was having some kind of problem breathing. Like he had some

245
00:45:50,869 --> 00:45:59,449
things stuck in his throat. Maybe he went looking for something to drink. What? Is there a bar?

246
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:20,809
Or should I... one of the vending machines? Check the vending machines. Okay, there's one here.

247
00:46:21,369 --> 00:46:39,610
You got a soft drink. You just wasted your channel points? I'm sorry to hear that. Not that one.

248
00:46:40,570 --> 00:47:07,690
He wanted a drink. He got a soft drink. You see anybody? A middle-aged man carrying a bag. Hmm.

249
00:47:08,329 --> 00:47:14,980
Well, I did see a man who didn't look well buy some juice, but he didn't have a bag though. If

250
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:20,179
it's the same man, he must have lost it before coming here. Why don't you ask around? Don't you

251
00:47:20,179 --> 00:47:25,699
watch detective stories? That's the first step of any investigation. Find suspects and question them.

252
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:44,309
So it was from the library to here. Boy, that old guy really made me angry. Get a license

253
00:47:44,309 --> 00:47:52,380
and registration please. Saw him. He went running by real fast. Even ran into me. Kept on going

254
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:58,460
without even so much as a sorry. I was angry so I put the bag he dropped into a trash can.

255
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:11,460
Did he send you to look for it? Well, it's over there. Why don't you go get it? Bag. It's the killer.

256
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:16,300
All right, I got the bag. Back to the police station.

257
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:45,340
North. North. This song makes me want to pog. It's all good. That's a good thing.

258
00:48:47,849 --> 00:48:51,750
How is it? Why is it a bad thing? Directionally challenged. Yes, I know.

259
00:48:53,019 --> 00:49:00,440
I know. Blame the GPS system. Blame the invention of the GPS. We're all gonna be

260
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:09,610
fucked. Guys, even if I'm going down the street and I know exactly where I'm going, if I get in

261
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:18,139
my car... I know exactly where I'm going. GPS is just on. Just don't matter. It's just on.

262
00:49:18,139 --> 00:49:32,460
All right, I got your bag. Where's the guy with the... I got a bag. Wait, why? I don't know.

263
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:49,219
What does he do? Why is he not in here? Oh, there you are. Wait, that bag. It looks like...

264
00:49:52,699 --> 00:49:58,760
What? You found it? Oh, thank you so much. I was frightened to death thinking about what my wife

265
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:03,480
would do to me if she found out what had happened. As a reward, let me give you some of the money.

266
00:50:04,199 --> 00:50:08,659
What did you say? You don't need any? Well, here, at least accept this as thanks from me.

267
00:50:10,309 --> 00:50:19,179
Arm supporter. No, give... I'll take some money. I'm counting on you. All right, I did it. Arm

268
00:50:19,179 --> 00:50:26,980
supporter. I got a lot of new items. Wait, did he say... Did he say, oh, here's some money? No, no,

269
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:33,420
wait. No, you actually... You don't need it. Or did I say, I don't need it? There's not much happening

270
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:50,789
right now. Okay. One more try. Not much happening. Is somebody sick in the hospital? Okay.

271
00:50:51,349 --> 00:51:04,570
We'll go to the hospital. What's that? You say you don't need money? I'm going to use that at

272
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:20,780
the drive-through. And then the person will just very, very clearly say, sir, that'll be... That'll

273
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:31,260
be $8 and 20 cents. Please drive up. Sir, that'll be $8 and 20 cents. Please drive up. I thought I

274
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:45,210
had... I pressed the button. Yeah, you can't do omega lol minus two omega lol. Not counting.

275
00:51:45,210 --> 00:52:00,630
You're laughing. I win. I win. All right, let's get the car. Now I'm quiet, am I? Not anymore.

276
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:18,360
Give me some development here. Plastic was used to make Power Blaster L versus your firing range,

277
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:28,780
but your firepower is well. The bomb was used to make Power Blaster R, heavy-duty combat,

278
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:40,280
versus both firepower and speed. Okay. That's it. One more development. Favorite fast food

279
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:48,250
restaurant. Oh, that's tricky. That's tricky. I don't know if I can answer that. All right.

280
00:52:49,130 --> 00:52:58,039
Four attack. This is Omni Unit. Increases all abilities by one. Power Blaster R.

281
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:08,119
Now, these are not very good. Plus two, one, plus two, no. This shit I got is way better.

282
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:24,139
Plus three to both. What's my favorite fast food place? I mean, McDonald's is a really good...

283
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:32,469
McDonald's is a go-to. It's very, very... It's just, I know exactly what I like there.

284
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:39,099
I don't think McDonald's is the best fast food restaurant, but it's the one that it's pretty

285
00:53:39,099 --> 00:54:00,840
easy to go to. I already did a tier list. Ash House or GoGo is not fast food. It's a sit-down

286
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:19,539
restaurant. Wendy's? No, I'll be honest. I got sick of Wendy's. I don't know. This is weird.

287
00:54:19,539 --> 00:54:26,250
It's weird. I think Wendy's is a better... It's a better place than McDonald's. I think Wendy's is

288
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:31,849
better than McDonald's, but I got sick of Wendy's. I didn't get... Jesus, that scared the fucking shit

289
00:54:31,849 --> 00:54:40,940
out of me. Stop! Who just ran me? Somebody just ran me over. I got kind of sick of Wendy's.

290
00:54:41,659 --> 00:54:51,050
I don't know why, but I've not gotten sick of McDonald's. All right, let's go to the hospital.

291
00:54:51,050 --> 00:55:09,289
Hospital's in uptown. I thought I could beat it. Uptown is west? Yes. No, it's south and then west.

292
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:38,199
All right, just drive. Just bring me there. I have access to a car. Is there a person on the roof?

293
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:44,570
Well, I don't know. Whatever. I'm going to the hospital. Somebody said there's a sick person

294
00:55:44,570 --> 00:55:52,599
in the hospital. There's a side quest in here. That's where I'm going. How much longer of this

295
00:55:52,599 --> 00:56:02,650
game? Until it's done and then I'm gonna be done streaming. This is the hospital. Okay, who's in

296
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:08,659
the hospital? You. We don't get many patients, actually. Everyone on the island's pretty healthy.

297
00:56:12,090 --> 00:56:22,179
You. Am I? I actually don't know the answer to this question. Yeah.

298
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:57,030
All right, yeah. How do I do that? I feel like I've come down with a cold.

299
00:56:57,110 --> 00:57:07,750
But I thought I'd have the doc take a look at me. All right, let's go. I gotta. Let's leave and come

300
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:32,760
back. In the hospital with a cold. Room 305. You know, I thought I would go to the hospital. I

301
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:47,860
have a stuffy nose. Am I? Did I make it? One of my patients is this darling little girl, but she's

302
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:52,980
very ill and has lost the ability to walk. If we just had some more modern equipment here, we could

303
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:58,500
probably cure her, but I just wish there was something I could do for her. I don't have any

304
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:14,630
equipment? Sure, but we don't have any equipment. Well, we're supposed to talk. I'm supposed to

305
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:45,449
tell her stories of my adventures. I don't have an item. I'm gonna go talk to the mayor. All right,

306
00:58:45,449 --> 00:58:54,710
we'll go talk to the mayor. If only there was some person who could allocate funds to the city,

307
00:58:54,710 --> 00:59:03,000
some sort of mayoral figure. I know, I just wanted to talk. I just wanted to talk for a sec.

308
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:11,289
All right, where's my special car? Take me to city hall. I'm gonna make this. I'm gonna make this

309
00:59:11,289 --> 00:59:33,340
good. Kill the monkey. Why do you guys want me to kill the monkey? Can you use a funny voice changer

310
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:42,090
for the rest of the stream? I'll do this for you. I will pitch shift myself up one, one tab and see

311
00:59:42,090 --> 00:59:50,360
if anybody realizes it as we play. Like this. Sorry, like this. Okay, so I'm pitch shifted up

312
00:59:50,360 --> 01:00:00,139
one tiny bit and I'm gonna tell everybody I got a new microphone. Is this too noticeable?

313
01:00:01,349 --> 01:00:13,750
Is it? Is this too noticeable? No, it's not. You can't hear it at all. Not at all. How about that?

314
01:00:15,590 --> 01:00:20,070
You tell me when it gets to be too like, like absolutely he's fucking around and he's making

315
01:00:20,070 --> 01:00:25,190
a joke. At that point, no. Like, oh wow, this is funny. He's like on a voice change run. Is

316
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:39,800
that way there now? Go back? Don't go so too far. Okay. So how's this? Is this better? Right here?

317
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:51,320
A little bit more. This is perfect. I'll actually heal him. What if I do this? How does this sound?

318
01:00:51,320 --> 01:01:00,820
This is going to be a little bit different. Should I go more? Like over here? Or back? No,

319
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:06,469
I can't. I don't know what it sounds like. I have no idea what this sounds like. A little more? No,

320
01:01:06,469 --> 01:01:21,590
lower? All right. How's that? Right here? Right there? That sounds all right, doesn't it? Right

321
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:28,250
here. Right here. Higher. Too low? No, no, no. I think it's all right. Is this any different from

322
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:36,679
the normal mic? All right. I'll show you what the difference is. Uh, A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

323
01:01:36,679 --> 01:01:50,489
A, B, C, D, E, F, G. A, B, C, D, E, F, G. That sounds the same. That's the same. Exactly the same.

324
01:01:50,489 --> 01:02:01,780
No way. A, B, C, D. A, B, C, D. People think the speakers are broken? How could there be no

325
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:13,289
difference? I don't understand how it could be. I don't really like get it. Usually I can get this

326
01:02:13,289 --> 01:02:35,369
off pretty quickly. I have to do that like once a week. I'm sorry. Somebody, okay, person on the

327
01:02:35,369 --> 01:02:43,780
roof. Who the fuck is on the roof? I don't see anybody on a roof. What are you talking about?

328
01:02:48,519 --> 01:02:52,599
I mean, if you give me access to instant bugleberry, I'm going to use it like at least

329
01:02:52,599 --> 01:03:03,059
once every couple of weeks. Somebody's on the roof of the hospital. What? Are you serious?

330
01:03:13,699 --> 01:03:18,789
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Where is this person? This person on the roof of the city hall?

331
01:03:19,590 --> 01:03:35,179
I don't see anybody up here. To the left of city hall. There is no left of city hall. That is city

332
01:03:35,179 --> 01:03:55,820
hall, isn't it? There's nobody on a roof. What are you talking about? There ain't nobody on a roof.

333
01:04:24,409 --> 01:04:32,699
Shit, I jumped. I thought you guys were bullshitting me. Why would I think there'd

334
01:04:32,699 --> 01:04:38,860
be somebody walking around on a roof? I'd love to climb the main gate, but I'm sure the police

335
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:50,809
would stop me. Yeah, this was a real good quest. There's a wink. Worst fucking thing I've ever done

336
01:04:50,809 --> 01:05:04,090
in my life is put that on. Okay. City, we've got a city hall. City hall. We got to go to city hall.

337
01:05:11,059 --> 01:05:16,869
Remove it. No, I'm gonna, don't worry. I'm going to give you a date for when it's going to get

338
01:05:16,869 --> 01:05:23,619
removed. Imagine paying 75,000 points and getting a half-assed wink. I know. It's,

339
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:35,559
I know. Trust me. I'm aware. I know. Imagine paying 75,000 points. Okay. About the hospital's

340
01:05:35,559 --> 01:05:40,440
equipment. I've been wanting to upgrade the hospital's equipment with the latest models

341
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:47,940
for some time, but to do that we need $15,000. I can do it. You don't have enough money? What?

342
01:05:48,659 --> 01:06:02,099
I don't have any money. I don't have enough money. All right. I'm going to go get,

343
01:06:02,099 --> 01:06:13,210
I gotta get money. Imagine using points and not advertising Nancy Drew. All right. I'm going to

344
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:19,800
go grind. Uh, where's a good grind spot? Those, uh, it's a good spot to get like quick money.

345
01:06:20,519 --> 01:06:35,780
That old, that old town place. Go to the card and forest dungeon. Um, on a pulse that I didn't make,

346
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:40,019
I don't mean anything. I just want to make sure to wear that. Replace German with Bugleberry for

347
01:06:40,019 --> 01:06:54,699
rest of the stream. No. Why would I do that? In like title, the stream Bugleberry finishes

348
01:06:54,699 --> 01:07:16,340
Mega Man. What are you guys trying to do to me? All right. The dungeon here. Vacuum for grinding.

349
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:41,849
Save the grocer's wife. Why is this a good grind spot?

350
01:07:41,849 --> 01:07:49,420
Do you place it in that old city better? This is not the dungeon.

351
01:07:51,579 --> 01:08:01,590
This is not a good spot. Yeah. The dead, the spots with the, um, yeah, that's what I was thinking.

352
01:08:12,219 --> 01:08:19,659
Bring the drill into. Yeah. I'm going to, I'll equip the drill. Uh, let's go. Which one's this one

353
01:08:19,659 --> 01:08:26,659
downtown? Let's go to the one. Let's go. I'm here. I'm ready. I just need like fucking to do it like

354
01:08:26,659 --> 01:08:46,260
two or three times. How much do I donate for a full 60 seconds of Bugleberry? I really don't know

355
01:08:46,260 --> 01:08:56,739
where I'm supposed to be going next. I think if it were me and it is me Bugleberry, I would say

356
01:08:56,739 --> 01:09:11,350
I would need to go west. Oh, sure. It's scary for diabolical going west. I will tell you something

357
01:09:11,350 --> 01:09:19,510
that I think is important. I have not picked up a controller in probably 30 years. I don't know

358
01:09:19,510 --> 01:09:23,750
anything about video games. I don't know what buttons to press. Maybe you guys could help me,

359
01:09:23,750 --> 01:09:31,720
but I thought it would be fantastic. Oh, that was, oh, I forgot to tell you the price. Uh,

360
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:41,510
it was five grand. A thousand, a hundred thousand channel points to get a high from Bugleberry. No,

361
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:46,550
that's the same thing as a wink. It's just more, it's a button I have to press and I have to derail

362
01:09:46,550 --> 01:09:59,529
like, oh, hey, it's me Bugleberry. Hey, it's me Bugleberry. Hey, oh, oh, oh, it's me Bugleberry.

363
01:10:07,579 --> 01:10:26,520
A million points. Oh, fuck. Exposed. It's not him. Go get the mask. No. No, I don't want to get the

364
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:31,319
mask and turn the lights down in the room and like do Bugleberry. No, he's not here.

365
01:10:37,050 --> 01:10:40,010
What am I doing? I keep getting sidetracked. All right, I'm going to go up.

366
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:56,899
No, I, it's right here. There it is. Save the Grosher's wife.

367
01:10:58,149 --> 01:11:00,390
They'll be all right for a little bit. I'll be good. I just need to get some money.

368
01:11:09,189 --> 01:11:26,920
I'm gonna let Bugleberry scream. I'm gonna get killed. How much are these all worth? What's the,

369
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:50,810
what are the blue ones actually even worth? Oh, what the heck? Where? I haven't saved the fucking

370
01:11:50,810 --> 01:11:53,529
game. I haven't saved the fucking game. I haven't saved the fucking game. I haven't saved the fucking

371
01:11:53,529 --> 01:12:26,279
game. I gotta kill this guy first. Explode. There we go. All right, good. 75,000 for

372
01:12:26,279 --> 01:12:38,119
Germakiss. I don't even know what that means. My cat's having a bad dream. Can you wish her well?

373
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:50,060
No, I wish you, I wish you not having a bad dream, cat. Did it help?

374
01:12:57,369 --> 01:13:12,119
Pretty good grind spot. You're right. All right, do it again. How much money do I have? 33,000.

375
01:13:12,439 --> 01:13:30,979
I'm gonna do this like five times. 19,000. I'll make it faster with the vacuum. Come pick me up.

376
01:13:31,619 --> 01:13:37,939
Are you sure? This is like an eight dollar lift ride. You really want to go down the street?

377
01:13:37,939 --> 01:14:00,939
Yeah, I guess. I don't want to walk. Where's my, not the drill, not the grenade. The vacuum. Okay.

378
01:14:01,739 --> 01:14:26,340
Coke versus Pepsi. Coke is better. Coke is better than Pepsi. In fact, most of the Coke products

379
01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:48,579
are better than the Pepsi products. For instance, like Sprite, way better. Sprite,

380
01:14:48,579 --> 01:14:52,899
yes. Sprite's the best soda. Like just, if I could only have one soda for the rest of my life,

381
01:14:52,899 --> 01:15:07,220
it would be Sprite. Okay, everyone asks for Coke and Sprite, but all you have is Sierra

382
01:15:07,220 --> 01:15:13,500
Mist and Pepsi. I know. It's like, you know, frankly, it's bullshit. I'll be honest. Frankly,

383
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:18,939
it's bullshit. Can I get a Coke? We have Pepsi only. Yeah, they made a Super Bowl commercial on

384
01:15:18,939 --> 01:15:31,399
it. Doesn't that mean that people like Coke more than Pepsi? Remember like the Steve Carell

385
01:15:31,399 --> 01:15:37,159
commercial where it was like, is Pepsi okay? Is Pepsi okay? No, Pepsi's better and it's awesome

386
01:15:37,159 --> 01:15:54,039
and of course it's okay. Well, I asked for Coke, but clearly it's not. They're both the same damn

387
01:15:54,039 --> 01:16:00,279
thing. The only difference is Coke. Pepsi is like smoother than Coke. Coke is a little harsher.

388
01:16:00,279 --> 01:16:38,409
I like it like that though. Joel bullies Germo. What? I don't have time for his shit right now.

389
01:16:39,369 --> 01:16:56,420
Free money. Free money. Free money. Free money. Free money. Free money. Free money. Yep.

390
01:16:57,140 --> 01:17:15,140
Coke in the glass is unbeatable. Yeah, I would say so. Where are you? How much for a Bugleberry

391
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:19,140
appearance? What if I just did like a one-man show and there was those, you remember those old like

392
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:24,979
infomercial kind of commercials? Imagine I advertised for it on TV. Like Bugleberry being

393
01:17:24,979 --> 01:17:29,939
there would be like a selling point for one of the tickets. And don't forget, B.F. Bugleberry

394
01:17:29,939 --> 01:17:36,149
will make his appearance doing his one-man take on the current horror movies. And it's just fucking

395
01:17:36,149 --> 01:17:49,180
me in a mask like, for one night only. And who could forget Grandpa? And just me with a mustache

396
01:17:49,180 --> 01:18:01,100
on like a hat on like, you know, you're ruining the illusion. But that would be me doing the

397
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:20,229
Bugleberry impression. I can't. I mean, these are real people. You don't think I have a real

398
01:18:20,229 --> 01:18:49,510
grandfather? I, of course I do. And he's been on camera. All right, give me a room. This way,

399
01:18:49,510 --> 01:18:56,020
that way, this way, that way, this way, that way. Ever since somebody said that with the auto face

400
01:18:56,020 --> 01:19:18,100
is the only thing I can think of. Whoa, you came out of nowhere. You storm trooper for the next

401
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:25,380
five minutes. What does that mean? What are you talking about? Like,

402
01:19:29,939 --> 01:20:05,060
that what you want? Pick up that cam. That it? Nope. That's that was on like Obama on a shitty

403
01:20:05,060 --> 01:20:27,909
mic. Okay, the pitch is down. I get you. It's a combine. All right. Yeah, I see. What does it

404
01:20:27,909 --> 01:21:08,760
sound like? You just called Obama on the phone. I didn't get the money. Do pick up that.

405
01:21:08,760 --> 01:22:24,300
Yeah. I'm missing money. What? I have to pay attention to video games. Call Bernie Sanders.

406
01:22:25,020 --> 01:22:31,020
This is not like the impression. The funny impression hour. Who cares? Yeah. Well, I

407
01:22:31,979 --> 01:22:40,420
call Bernie. Oh, I've been called Bernie Sanders right now. Let's see what he's up to.

408
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:56,899
Actually, I know what he's up to. He's debating on stage down the street. That's where he is.

409
01:22:57,460 --> 01:23:19,510
They're in Nevada right now. How much money do I have? All right. I got enough. I got enough.

410
01:23:20,069 --> 01:23:29,399
We can go do all this stuff. Raid them with this. Wait, raid the Democratic primary debate.

411
01:23:30,279 --> 01:23:38,470
It's not even that's not impossible. Can you imagine how stupid that would be?

412
01:23:39,189 --> 01:23:48,920
All right. Imagine a world, right? Can you imagine? Yeah. And Elizabeth Warren, what do you

413
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:55,380
think about? Oh, hold on a second here. What's going on? Are we getting a raid? Yeah. It looks

414
01:23:55,380 --> 01:24:02,100
like we're getting a raid from German 985. Gerber, Gerber. Hey, how are you, Gerber? It is great to

415
01:24:02,180 --> 01:24:09,380
hear your voice. Oh, the rats. Here come the rats. Here they are. Oh, the rats. Here they are.

416
01:24:09,380 --> 01:24:14,260
I love those rats. Hey, how stupid would that be? It would be fucking unbelievable.

417
01:24:14,260 --> 01:24:22,970
People just keep raiding to get like this. Hey, thanks for the raid. It would be like calling

418
01:24:22,970 --> 01:24:31,670
out people in chat. I just want to say, if we could put it in sub only mode, I'm seeing a lot

419
01:24:31,670 --> 01:24:45,100
of bullshit over here. I don't, there's a lot of stuff that I don't like. No, no, no. You don't

420
01:24:45,260 --> 01:24:47,340
actually have. No, I don't mean, that wasn't me.

421
01:24:58,869 --> 01:25:02,789
Raiding the debate and they have to address it. And if they don't address it, it's like, yo,

422
01:25:02,789 --> 01:25:09,609
whoa. I'm not going to like, not going to mention the raid. Okay. But if I follow any of you on

423
01:25:09,609 --> 01:25:23,590
Twitter. All right. Let's go back to, uh, they do like an elaborate, like, like, oh, we got a raid

424
01:25:23,590 --> 01:25:27,670
and they fucking start screaming and like talking about the raid. Like, look out, it's a raid.

425
01:25:28,630 --> 01:25:34,470
Oh, the German, the rats. Everyone has their own, everyone gets like 10 seconds to respond.

426
01:25:41,210 --> 01:25:49,739
Um, Mr. Steyer, how do you respond to the rat raid? I don't, I, I don't know who the fuck that

427
01:25:49,739 --> 01:26:12,220
is. Can we go back to the issues, please? Steyer's not in the debate. Really? Are you sure? Because

428
01:26:12,220 --> 01:26:31,189
he's the only commercial I see on TV. Are we certain about that? All right. Where am I going?

429
01:26:37,819 --> 01:26:40,779
All right. Right. I get it. Okay. I got to go. Who watches TV?

430
01:26:43,829 --> 01:26:48,069
Hospital. All right. We're going to go up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up the city hall.

431
01:26:48,069 --> 01:26:58,630
Just take me there. If you have enough, if you have enough Twitch followers, you get to be on

432
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:11,239
the debate stage. Yeah. The new, the new, uh, the new percentages you need to be on the stage at

433
01:27:11,239 --> 01:27:17,399
the Nevada debate. Yeah. You need at least 10% of the national poll or a peak at over 10,000

434
01:27:17,399 --> 01:27:24,630
concurrent viewers on Twitch. We've got quite a few people here actually from like the Twitch

435
01:27:24,630 --> 01:27:56,390
side of things. Ninja versus Bernie debate. All right. Let's, let's get the fuck out of this.

436
01:28:08,710 --> 01:28:27,529
Oh, we're talking politics. No, I'm not. We're talking, uh, I guess kind of. Tom Steyer paid

437
01:28:27,529 --> 01:28:51,590
for a mariachi band and a taco truck at my caucus location in South Vegas. Hey for the equipment.

438
01:28:57,289 --> 01:29:13,289
Yeah. The debates are in Vegas right now. I can pay for that. Did I do it? About the investigation.

439
01:29:14,380 --> 01:29:19,260
The only room left unexplored is the main gate. Who knows what's inside and what will happen if

440
01:29:19,260 --> 01:29:24,460
we tamper with it. I don't know if it hadn't been for you, Mega Man. I shudder to think what those

441
01:29:24,460 --> 01:29:32,199
pirates would have done to the Island. I'll leave everything in your capable hands. All right. Let's

442
01:29:32,199 --> 01:29:36,279
go back. The fate of our Island rests on your shoulders. Thanks for the pressure. God damn it.

443
01:29:36,279 --> 01:29:49,289
You could have just said good luck. All right. Somebody just said fail politics with a cringe

444
01:29:49,289 --> 01:30:04,279
country. What does that mean? Fail politics for a cringed country. That's fucking ridiculous.

445
01:30:11,670 --> 01:30:18,810
I love it. All right. Let's go. Let's go. Dude, your country is kind of cringe.

446
01:30:20,789 --> 01:30:29,449
I mean, this isn't, this isn't your dad singing happy birthday in loudly in a restaurant for

447
01:30:29,449 --> 01:30:50,069
dinner. This is like an entire country. What? That's not inaccurate. Exactly. Oh, shit. Oh,

448
01:30:50,069 --> 01:31:05,319
shit. Debate panel. Bernie, how would you like to respond to that? I just want to say that I think

449
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:18,329
that answer was cringe. Yeah. Oh, cringe, you fucker. You posted cringe and you shouldn't feel bad for

450
01:31:19,289 --> 01:31:52,100
that. Get him, get him Bernie. You face cam for the entire stream. No, he's not talking about his

451
01:31:52,100 --> 01:32:13,000
other people's low sub and follower count. I mean, I don't. All right. I got to play,

452
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:29,270
I have to play Mega Man Legends. Okay. Hold on. Did I save it? I did. Right. We got to go to the

453
01:32:29,270 --> 01:32:48,970
hospital, which is in uptown. Do Obama reading bits from the phone? Bro, are we playing Mega

454
01:32:48,970 --> 01:33:07,770
Man Legends or not? Fuck. Yes. Yes, we are. Yes, we are. Back to the hospital. This way, that way,

455
01:33:07,770 --> 01:33:23,939
this way, that way. Oh, I can't get it out of my head. I love it. Okay. I'm here. You have to,

456
01:33:23,939 --> 01:33:28,550
you can't go inside without checking in. I mean, can't you guys just put me on like a list? I'm

457
01:33:28,550 --> 01:33:51,909
the guy in the blue suit. Oh, shit. The nurse told me that you bought them a machine that fixed my leg.

458
01:33:52,789 --> 01:34:00,600
Thank you. This is for you. What is it? I found it when I was out for a walk.

459
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:20,409
Flower Pearl. Come back and see me again. Pearl. Come back and see me again. All right. A little

460
01:34:20,409 --> 01:34:25,210
more rehabilitation and her leg will be as good as new. She can go home then. Thank you so much.

461
01:34:26,010 --> 01:34:47,989
That's what I do. I'm Mega Man. Finally saved the grocer's wife. She's out in a field. I don't know

462
01:34:47,989 --> 01:34:55,609
where that is. I have no idea. I have no idea. I don't know where that is. Let's see if I can do

463
01:34:55,609 --> 01:35:15,460
anything with this. I wonder if I got the posse to do anything with this. Develop something. Let me.

464
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:24,199
Mega Man. Gatling part and Flower Pearl were used to make the Buster part Gatling gun.

465
01:35:25,239 --> 01:35:51,340
Really? So, Kardon Forest. Can you tell me there's somebody right here? The one percent of

466
01:35:51,340 --> 01:35:56,380
streamers, they got all the bits. That's cringe everyone. We need to wake up, wake up America.

467
01:35:56,380 --> 01:36:09,130
We need to give big bits to the people. That's a cringe. God damn it. So, walk through the path

468
01:36:09,130 --> 01:36:38,119
between the rocks at the flutter. The path between the rocks. These two rocks. Got it. I came out

469
01:36:38,119 --> 01:36:45,029
here to get some fresh air and look at the scenery, but my stomach, oh it hurts. What do you do? Take

470
01:36:45,029 --> 01:37:02,340
her to the hospital. See if she gets better. Anna, are you all right? Sorry, but you can't go inside

471
01:37:02,340 --> 01:37:10,279
without. You just watched me come in and bring like a sick person. Have you come to visit Iron?

472
01:37:10,279 --> 01:37:21,449
No. If you're worried about that woman who just came in, she's fine. Maybe you should come back

473
01:37:21,449 --> 01:37:40,380
after she's calmed down a little. Outman. Use a JPG instead of a face cam? Nah. I'm back. My new

474
01:37:40,380 --> 01:37:49,750
father seems really happy. Thanks for your help. You're welcome. Um, I did? Have you come to visit

475
01:37:49,750 --> 01:37:58,939
Iron? I, no, I came to, is that it? That's it. You're the one who helped Anna, aren't you? Thank you

476
01:37:58,939 --> 01:38:14,149
so much. Here, take this as a token of my thanks. You got a sunlight. All right. But did you just

477
01:38:14,149 --> 01:38:47,829
like push me outside? Get some vitamin D, you little shit. Can I do anything with this? Nope. Okay.

478
01:38:49,239 --> 01:38:57,770
All right. It's time. It's time to go to the main gate. It's time. I'm gonna put on the Gatling gun.

479
01:38:57,770 --> 01:39:14,310
Put it here. Okay. Buster parts. Equip. The Gatling gun. So this is attack four. Gatling gun is

480
01:39:16,020 --> 01:39:37,350
one, attack one range in four energy. No. I think what I had on was the best thing I can do.

481
01:39:37,989 --> 01:39:57,659
It's just a ton of attack in a ton of, I can just spam with the max attack. The only thing I do,

482
01:39:57,659 --> 01:40:05,050
I mean, I only have rapid. I'm surprised this is not rapid. Okay. How could it be Gatling gun?

483
01:40:05,050 --> 01:40:19,210
If it's just, yeah, I'll keep what I had on. I have to put, I'm going to spend the rest of my money.

484
01:40:23,220 --> 01:40:36,460
We have to go downtown first. We got to refill the canteen. Buy a couple more things and that's it.

485
01:40:36,460 --> 01:40:59,180
Try it. Please try it. Try it. Try it. What? Is that north? I went to the museum. I'm still missing

486
01:40:59,180 --> 01:41:06,140
a couple items though. Hope you have a wonderful day. See you later. Hope you have a wonderful day

487
01:41:06,140 --> 01:41:26,119
too. Thanks. That's really nice of you. Say that. Refill canteen. All right. Buy. This Kevlar jacket

488
01:41:26,119 --> 01:41:48,420
is 120. But fuck it. Blasted unit. Range. Turbo battery. Is there any rapid? No. Blasted unit omega.

489
01:41:49,060 --> 01:42:06,840
Is that two and three? That's kind of okay. But is it maxed out? I'll get the, I'll get the

490
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:11,079
shield. The invincibility. I'm going to get the invulnerability shield and just get all these

491
01:42:11,079 --> 01:42:17,739
things. I'll figure out what the fuck they do. All right. I'm going to sell some stuff. Sell.

492
01:42:21,210 --> 01:42:43,350
Oh my God. No, I'm using all these. I don't think I'm going to use these ever. I really don't think

493
01:42:43,350 --> 01:42:52,420
I'm going to put at least these. Maybe the Gatling gun. Maybe. I don't know. I have no idea. What about

494
01:42:52,420 --> 01:43:00,229
items? Anything worth a lot of money? Can I get a hit of your jewel please?

495
01:43:20,630 --> 01:43:31,640
All right. Time to save the game. Not yet. We do special weapons. Change weapon. I'm going to,

496
01:43:31,640 --> 01:43:34,920
what should I put on for? Active buster. I think that's what I've upgraded the most.

497
01:43:35,800 --> 01:43:39,960
Active buster. And we're going to enhance it. Do I have enough money to do anything with it?

498
01:43:39,960 --> 01:43:53,460
I have 14,000. Nope. Blow. Blow. Please. Please. Blow. What? Please. Bro. Bro. Please. Please,

499
01:43:53,460 --> 01:44:00,939
bro. Do a five second review of Overwatch. Um, the game was fun for six months and I never

500
01:44:00,939 --> 01:44:37,979
played it again. That's it. Save again. Rick and Morty impressions. That's not going to happen.

501
01:44:37,979 --> 01:44:44,869
Anybody know if the new episode came out yet? The new, like they were there, they're half season,

502
01:44:44,869 --> 01:45:19,350
right? Oh, try Gatling gun. Try Gatling gun. Try Gatling gun. So let's go. Let's take off.

503
01:45:20,310 --> 01:45:34,579
Auto battery and put on Gatling gun. You can see it's not doing very much. It was better having

504
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:51,270
the auto battery on, but I have max energy that I can just spam. I'm going to hold it down the

505
01:45:51,270 --> 01:45:57,909
whole time. Move around. All right. Let's go to the room. Uh, I have to go to, it's all the way down.

506
01:45:58,710 --> 01:46:13,239
Wish I had the Kevlar right now, but I don't. Oh, I'm so fucking nervous. Screen saver room

507
01:46:17,220 --> 01:46:24,579
or, I mean, we've given this a couple of names. This also could be potential virus. Why? Why can

508
01:46:24,579 --> 01:46:35,100
I say ours today? Potential virus. The joke is ruined. Potential virus shareware FPS game made

509
01:46:35,100 --> 01:46:46,810
by one person in like 1996. If I said it correctly the first time, maybe it would have been humorous.

510
01:46:56,439 --> 01:47:14,010
Shareware? What? What did I, I said shareware. Shareware. Shareware. And now I have, now my

511
01:47:14,010 --> 01:47:32,890
shield's gone. What? He's devolving. Shareware. I have an accent sometimes. You know, everybody

512
01:47:32,890 --> 01:47:42,229
doesn't talk the same way. There's different places that have different accents. Nobody talks

513
01:47:42,229 --> 01:48:15,100
the same way. Build it. Build it. How do I activate that super shield? It's a good level

514
01:48:15,100 --> 01:48:28,710
design. I know it's not. I'm sorry. I'm showing you this, that level design. Why is it so bright?

515
01:48:28,710 --> 01:48:35,210
It's part of the way the game gets captured through this upscaler. All right. Here we go.

516
01:48:35,210 --> 01:48:44,680
This is it, right? Huh? There's some writing. Watcher. What is that supposed to mean?

517
01:48:45,239 --> 01:48:58,420
It's just labeled, Mega Man. The second door. What is this? It reads sleeper.

518
01:49:04,819 --> 01:49:12,899
Third door. What does this one say? Dreamer? Well, it should be the last one.

519
01:49:22,010 --> 01:49:29,960
Uh oh. Here comes the great, the big reveal of the game. What's happening to me? This is the first

520
01:49:29,960 --> 01:49:36,520
time I've ever been here, but I feel like I've seen this before. Something is telling me there's

521
01:49:36,520 --> 01:50:08,180
danger here, that it shouldn't be opened. Uh oh. It's a man? Person? Sephiroth? Was it you who

522
01:50:08,180 --> 01:50:20,380
awoke me? It is somewhat earlier than I had, but no matter. Thank you for awakening me. Hmm. Have

523
01:50:20,380 --> 01:50:27,479
we met before? Oh, please forgive me. You are a purifier model, assigned to the direct command

524
01:50:27,560 --> 01:50:34,119
of Mother. Team Rocket? You are designated Mega Man Trigger. Please forgive me. I did not recognize

525
01:50:34,119 --> 01:50:45,510
you in your current configuration. You, you know me? You don't remember? Ah, I see. You have

526
01:50:45,510 --> 01:50:54,979
suffered memory loss, yes? Then for what purpose have you awakened me? I assume. I'm gonna kill you

527
01:50:54,979 --> 01:51:00,739
myself, that's why. That your reason for coming here is to purge the carbons that have over

528
01:51:00,739 --> 01:51:08,359
propagated during the time I was inactive. Carbons? Purge? What are you talking about?

529
01:51:09,239 --> 01:51:14,600
According to Urban Military Security Ordinance A10, the number of carbon units is not allowed

530
01:51:14,600 --> 01:51:20,279
to increase beyond the pre-specified limit. If this happens, they are to be purged immediately.

531
01:51:20,279 --> 01:51:25,880
My observation, if left unattended, the carbons will reproduce indefinitely. Their numbers will

532
01:51:25,880 --> 01:51:31,720
grow, polluting the surface world. They can be quite a nuisance. Carbons? Do you mean

533
01:51:32,439 --> 01:51:38,439
the people on the island? The carbons fit mass population Model B. They are unstable,

534
01:51:39,159 --> 01:51:45,479
very difficult to control. Perhaps it would be better to simply reinitialize. Reinitialize?

535
01:51:45,479 --> 01:51:48,119
No, no, you don't understand. I haven't understood much of what you've been saying,

536
01:51:48,119 --> 01:51:54,739
but when you say reinitialize, do you mean no? No, you don't. No, no, the universe is fine.

537
01:51:54,979 --> 01:51:56,020
The universe is fine.

538
01:51:57,779 --> 01:52:03,180
Teasel? This is quite reprehensible. It would be much simpler if I had the

539
01:52:03,180 --> 01:52:08,300
assistance of a proficient unit such as yourself. It was horrible. Once my task is complete,

540
01:52:08,300 --> 01:52:11,659
I shall inquire as to the presence of a backup of your memory on A1.

541
01:52:11,659 --> 01:52:15,819
All right, can we get the stop? No more flashing, please? Yes, until then.

542
01:52:17,979 --> 01:52:32,630
Oh, this hurts. I'm about to press a button. Did you hear that, Teasel? Yep,

543
01:52:32,630 --> 01:52:41,619
something tells me he's not kidding either. It's the Tron bones. Teasel, we've got to do

544
01:52:41,619 --> 01:52:48,939
something. We've got to stop him. That's easier said than done. Besides, do you think we could

545
01:52:48,939 --> 01:52:59,529
beat him? The Tron bones. What about Mega Man? I don't like it, but I can't think of anything

546
01:52:59,529 --> 01:53:10,550
better, so. Oh, here's a problem. Hey, Tron, how do you stop this thing?

547
01:53:11,670 --> 01:53:24,810
Oh, this? Like this. Thank you. Mega Man. Oh shit, pirates. Thanks for your help.

548
01:53:24,810 --> 01:53:38,380
Hurry up. He's getting away. Right. It's not over between you and me. I won't forgive you if you die

549
01:53:38,380 --> 01:53:51,659
or anything stupid like that, so be careful in there, okay? Right. See you later. Don't worry,

550
01:53:51,659 --> 01:53:59,319
Tron. If anyone can do it, he can. I know. Don't die, you stupid fucking idiot. I haven't even

551
01:53:59,319 --> 01:54:27,659
got a chance to play. I'm going to get healed. Just relax. Ooh, Mega Man dies from the first

552
01:54:27,659 --> 01:54:35,289
enemy. Power stream. He's still giving me items. Isn't this like the final portion of the whole

553
01:54:35,289 --> 01:54:54,920
game? Oh shit, a golden crab. Is it a buster part? Oh fuck, it is. All right, laser is plus four

554
01:54:54,920 --> 01:55:04,180
attack. Max is out attack. All right, hold on a second here. Maxed attack, maxed energy. That

555
01:55:04,180 --> 01:55:15,819
means I don't need this anymore. Energy in rapid? No, no, I don't need any. I'm looking for range

556
01:55:15,819 --> 01:55:26,039
in rapid. Do I have any range in rapid? No range, no rapid. Energy in range, attack in range,

557
01:55:28,859 --> 01:55:38,279
attack, range, and energy. No, I don't need that. I have rapid two. Is rapid two better than range

558
01:55:38,279 --> 01:56:01,609
in rapid one? Let's see. I lose range though. That's okay, that's pretty good. Gatling gun, laser.

559
01:56:01,609 --> 01:56:17,140
No, there's nothing else down here. Damn, no range. Are we sure? Range, sniper scope. I mean,

560
01:56:17,140 --> 01:56:26,470
that's just a, just, it's all range. Let me see what this does. Range and a little bit more range

561
01:56:26,470 --> 01:56:42,260
and then I'll do this for now. No, you're right. I'm going to need the range. I'm going to need the

562
01:56:42,260 --> 01:57:03,560
range. Might as well take it if it's for free. Final boss room is tiny. Well, appreciate the

563
01:57:03,560 --> 01:57:15,560
spoiler because that means I can take this off. And what is this going to do rapid too? Or is it,

564
01:57:15,560 --> 01:57:33,539
it was a rapid, what's it called? Rapid striker. But this range might be bad. Oh well. I have plus

565
01:57:33,539 --> 01:57:46,069
three rapid? Did I? Is this the room? You can feel tremendous energy emanating from the refractor.

566
01:57:46,069 --> 01:57:55,060
It's being held in place by some kind of powerful force. It appears as if the entire main gate

567
01:57:55,060 --> 01:58:17,289
is under the control of Mega Man Juno. Who am I? Mega Man Volnut, right? Well, looks like we're

568
01:58:17,289 --> 01:58:31,289
going this way. Mega Man Juno versus Mega Man Volnut. His name is much cooler than mine. This

569
01:58:31,289 --> 01:59:01,220
is a bright area. I can't even see. Dentist hallway? Yeah, pretty much. Uh oh. What's the

570
01:59:01,220 --> 01:59:08,390
point of this room? No, what's the point of this room? Like, why would you put that there? I'm

571
01:59:08,390 --> 01:59:32,069
fucking pissed. Well, I haven't gone this way.

572
01:59:41,380 --> 01:59:48,069
Well, I found the door. Well, we've come a long way, haven't we? It would have been nice if we

573
01:59:48,069 --> 01:59:53,060
could have just kept on living in peace with Professor Enroll. But I guess we got to do what

574
01:59:53,060 --> 02:00:28,890
we got to do, right? Mega Man Juno is waiting for you inside. A fucking cringed monkey. I'm not

575
02:00:28,890 --> 02:00:47,319
done exploring. Tell me the lore? What lore do you want me to tell you? I'm not done exploring.

576
02:00:50,199 --> 02:00:54,359
No, I'm not. I'm not done. Look at down there. There's probably a secret enemy.

577
02:00:55,159 --> 02:01:24,699
There's not. No holes or anything? Well, what the fuck? All right, let's go. It's the end game. I

578
02:01:24,699 --> 02:01:32,199
know, but I would think there'd be some fun. Didn't 100% the game? It's too bad, I know.

579
02:01:39,289 --> 02:01:44,090
Tell me, what should I do now? Mega Man Juno is waiting for you inside. You can do it,

580
02:01:44,090 --> 02:01:51,159
Mega Man. I believe in you. Is it going to be okay? Well, you may not know anything about Juno, but

581
02:01:51,159 --> 02:01:57,060
judging from his model type, I'd say that your combat capabilities exceed his. Juno wasn't

582
02:01:57,060 --> 02:02:01,859
designed for combat, but still, as master of the island, you shouldn't underestimate him.

583
02:02:01,859 --> 02:02:08,180
Your relative levels of strength depend on how much you've developed your capabilities and weapons.

584
02:02:08,180 --> 02:02:13,909
What am I? What's the matter, Mega Man? Oh, you're wondering about what Juno said, hey?

585
02:02:13,909 --> 02:02:18,819
Does it matter? Whoever you are, you're still Mega Man, right? Come on,

586
02:02:18,819 --> 02:02:23,479
Roll and everyone else are counting on you. This is the real villain. You can't give up now.

587
02:02:23,479 --> 02:02:36,359
This is the real villain. I knew it was going to- I should have said it. I was thinking it,

588
02:02:36,359 --> 02:02:39,319
but I didn't say it. I knew it was going to be a fucking organ, and I didn't say it,

589
02:02:39,319 --> 02:02:44,359
and it would have been perfect. It appears I miscalculated the odds of your ability

590
02:02:44,359 --> 02:02:48,680
to escape that trap. Shit. I was going to say it too, right when I opened the door.

591
02:02:48,680 --> 02:02:58,069
However, too late. Eden was activated as soon as I entered this room. It cannot be deactivated as

592
02:02:58,069 --> 02:03:06,260
long as I, the master key of this island, remain here in this controller. A lot of trash out in

593
02:03:06,260 --> 02:03:12,260
space. All that remains now is to wait for Eden to enter transmission range and send the command

594
02:03:12,260 --> 02:03:22,760
to execute the reinitialization of this island. Once that command is received, the 10,000 workers

595
02:03:22,760 --> 02:03:28,340
aboard Eden will execute it immediately. My estimates indicate their work will be completed

596
02:03:28,340 --> 02:03:33,670
in less than five minutes. I only said Trump voice. This doesn't sound like Trump at all.

597
02:03:34,310 --> 02:04:15,510
Not even close. Uh, we stopped this, right? Now that Eden has been activated, any further

598
02:04:15,510 --> 02:04:19,909
interference from you will remain on file, thus tarnishing my operating record. Now that Eden

599
02:04:19,909 --> 02:04:24,149
has been activated- No, no, it's not. Fortunately, you are suffering from memory loss and fragmentation.

600
02:04:25,270 --> 02:04:31,350
Therefore, as keeper of this island, I hereby exercise my prerogative of correctional dispensation.

601
02:04:31,989 --> 02:04:40,199
Correctional? Allow me to rephrase. I will exercise my authority to terminate your program.

602
02:04:42,869 --> 02:04:43,350
Begin!

603
02:05:01,989 --> 02:05:21,350
Oh! Oh! Oh! Not a combat model yet. What the fuck are you talking about?

604
02:05:25,079 --> 02:05:31,420
Don't I have like invincibility? How do I turn on invincibility mode?

605
02:05:32,060 --> 02:05:56,600
How about this? Ready? How about this?

606
02:05:56,600 --> 02:06:08,439
Oi! What the fuck is he? What the fuck?

607
02:06:15,699 --> 02:06:23,130
Fucking L1R1 to turn the camera. It's just like, I may as well fucking put a blindfold on.

608
02:06:23,689 --> 02:06:47,640
I'm killing him, don't worry. Yeah, I chose that setting because the other one was way worse.

609
02:06:47,640 --> 02:06:53,560
The other one does- you can't strafe. Strafing doesn't exist if I turn the other one on,

610
02:06:53,560 --> 02:07:41,000
which sucks. Oh, what a pain in the absolute ass this actually is.

611
02:07:47,050 --> 02:07:59,930
It's just puke controlled. The whole world got- the quick turn like is hard to do because it's down

612
02:07:59,930 --> 02:08:11,210
in circle and sometimes it doesn't do anything. By the time you turn around you have to- he's

613
02:08:11,210 --> 02:08:22,170
already gone, so I have to hold R1 to like- and then walk forward. I can't increase the

614
02:08:22,170 --> 02:08:24,729
sensitivity on that fucking R-E. It's not gonna happen.

615
02:08:24,729 --> 02:08:58,630
What the fuck is happening?

616
02:10:01,899 --> 02:10:10,149
Somebody said that in chat. I thought you were making fun of me, but it's what a line he says.

617
02:10:33,350 --> 02:10:35,239
Ready?

618
02:10:38,600 --> 02:10:42,890
Not good enough. Turn, turn around. Turn the fuck around.

619
02:10:44,890 --> 02:11:01,670
What does that move? Heal. He's got a new attack this motherfucker.

620
02:11:01,670 --> 02:11:01,989
Ready?

621
02:11:18,810 --> 02:11:20,090
Oh, I forgot!

622
02:11:20,250 --> 02:11:20,489
What?

623
02:11:28,420 --> 02:11:30,899
What? I jumped over it.

624
02:12:12,250 --> 02:12:27,350
The fuck is?

625
02:12:30,149 --> 02:12:55,640
Hey, I'm ready for you to die. No choke. No choke. No choke. No choke. I can't even turn

626
02:12:55,640 --> 02:12:57,479
the fucking camera. I can't even turn the camera. I can't even turn the camera.

627
02:13:17,829 --> 02:13:18,470
Oh shit.

628
02:13:26,659 --> 02:13:28,739
Really? It's- it's delayed.

629
02:13:34,859 --> 02:13:36,220
He's gonna plug into a big thing.

630
02:13:38,220 --> 02:13:43,300
He's plugging into the ceiling and he's gonna turn into a giant thing. He's gonna turn to a

631
02:13:43,300 --> 02:13:46,739
key and unlock the door and behind the door is gonna be something huge.

632
02:13:48,100 --> 02:13:50,340
Yeah, of course there is. Why wouldn't there be?

633
02:15:18,569 --> 02:15:29,270
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Turn! What?

634
02:15:29,270 --> 02:16:08,550
What is that move he's doing? What the fuck is this move? Shield repair.

635
02:16:10,100 --> 02:16:23,699
Okay, now go invisible and recharge special weapon. All right, let's go.

636
02:16:23,699 --> 02:16:54,489
He can't see shit. He doesn't know where I am. And then- oh my god.

637
02:16:57,459 --> 02:17:09,350
I thought I had the shield fixed. I thought I've repaired the shield and I could take another hit.

638
02:17:09,350 --> 02:17:24,360
I killed you even with that. All right. It's because I got hit twice?

639
02:17:24,360 --> 02:17:41,579
I don't even have that Kevlar, you're right. Fuck. It's not good. All right, let me try it again.

640
02:18:25,190 --> 02:18:39,610
Turn please. I'll get greedy.

641
02:18:46,420 --> 02:18:55,639
Oh! This camera makes me want to throw up in my mouth. Turn the fucking camera game.

642
02:18:55,639 --> 02:18:59,719
Oh, he's getting actually bad. Actually bad. Actually bad.

643
02:19:35,299 --> 02:19:45,000
This moves around so quickly and I can't turn fast enough. Like, fuck you.

644
02:19:46,280 --> 02:19:56,659
I might have to go get the vest. I do have a full heal but I don't want to use it yet.

645
02:20:23,290 --> 02:20:38,329
Oh shit. Where is he? Piece of shit. Like, fuck that.

646
02:20:42,579 --> 02:20:46,899
Get these fucking things off, by the way. Get the sca- no. Where's the jump? Get these off.

647
02:20:47,700 --> 02:20:54,090
Get these- get them out of here. I like just moon shoes up into the air.

648
02:21:21,829 --> 02:21:27,620
Don't skip. Uh oh! Put them back on. Put them back on. Put them back on. Put them back on. Put them

649
02:21:27,620 --> 02:21:35,540
back on. Put these back on. They're very useful. Incredibly useful. Because now I- uh oh. Oh!

650
02:21:35,540 --> 02:21:59,780
Are you ready? No, I'm not.

651
02:22:33,940 --> 02:22:51,299
Don't jump at me. Alright, don't- jump now and then jump again. Here comes the lightning. Oh!

652
02:22:53,139 --> 02:23:14,409
I'm getting geno flashed. Damn it, I'm trying to fucking- the goddamn camera. Fuck this camera.

653
02:23:32,260 --> 02:23:45,420
Oh my god! It's so- you don't understand. Moving around sucks in this game. He's doing it again.

654
02:23:46,139 --> 02:24:10,860
Don't kill me, please! Step on his head.

655
02:24:23,750 --> 02:24:29,510
So, fuck you. Pick this guy up and penalty soccer ball throw him into space.

656
02:24:30,389 --> 02:24:33,829
Just watch him, like, crystallize while you go back to home.

657
02:24:49,590 --> 02:24:54,629
Requesting a reinitialization of this island's systems and a memory backup of its bureaucratic

658
02:24:54,629 --> 02:25:01,909
systems. That wasn't fast enough? Stop! Stop it! If you wish to shoot me, please do not hesitate.

659
02:25:03,270 --> 02:25:13,079
My program has already been backed up in Eden's central core.

660
02:25:13,319 --> 02:25:23,110
I eagerly await my next activation.

661
02:25:31,420 --> 02:25:32,860
That was fucking ridiculous.

662
02:25:48,329 --> 02:25:49,930
Oh, it's- trombone!

663
02:25:51,930 --> 02:25:52,430
What?

664
02:25:59,530 --> 02:26:00,329
Voice reveal?

665
02:26:19,030 --> 02:26:27,190
What just happened?

666
02:27:05,510 --> 02:27:15,180
Do you know why I stopped the car again?

667
02:27:39,100 --> 02:27:50,520
Mega Man Legends 2.

668
02:28:18,760 --> 02:28:39,700

747
02:46:02,100 --> 02:46:08,340
blew up to build this that's right that's right we'll just have to rough it until we get to the

748
02:46:08,340 --> 02:46:13,940
next island if we sell what we found we'll get back what we lost and then some we'll live like

02:46:13,940 --> 02:46:24,809
kings so they got the crystal who would have thought there was such a huge refractor down there

750
02:46:24,809 --> 02:46:29,450
and all we had to do was just wander in and pick it up i told you we'd have the last laugh

751
02:46:30,889 --> 02:46:43,139
that's assuming we make it to the next island without sinking oh well at least he's in a good

752
02:46:43,139 --> 02:46:59,559
mood if they drop that into the ocean is it gonna like electrocute earth remember we talked about

773
02:49:58,860 --> 02:50:02,940
just got back from the er i woke up this morning with severe side stomach pain and it was like a

774
02:50:02,940 --> 02:50:08,219
seven out of ten and when i got to the hospital of pain i was in i was getting so pissy with the

775
02:50:08,219 --> 02:50:13,100
doctors in my family and i'm like yelling to get rid of the pain i did a casket it turns out i have

776
02:50:13,100 --> 02:50:21,079
kidney stones in both kidneys holy shit that's not good i gotta pass them soon i wish you luck

777
02:50:21,079 --> 02:50:32,340
holy shit that sounds terrible uh also gonna stop drinking soda that was my day yeah cut back on so

778
02:50:32,340 --> 02:50:40,780
sodas you don't want to be drinking soda sometimes it's good i used to love it i still do cut out

779
02:50:40,780 --> 02:50:44,700
half the sodas you drink a day with water and maybe squeeze a little bit of lemon in there

780
02:50:44,700 --> 02:50:50,620
you won't you if you i need you need that sweetness you need that sugar you need that tang

781
02:50:51,340 --> 02:50:55,340
squeeze a little bit of lemon just a little bit and it's in the water and you trick your brain

782
02:50:55,340 --> 02:51:06,579
and think you're drinking fucking fruity yummy drink lime water yes if that's what you need to

783
02:51:06,579 --> 02:51:15,000
drink more water that's what you need to do just a little squeeze of lime that's it no not lemonade

784
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:21,719
not lemonade no squeeze the lime or you could just drink water that's also true but if people

785
02:51:21,719 --> 02:51:30,440
some people don't like to drink water if you're one of those people then gotta find ways to do it

786
02:51:31,079 --> 02:51:39,110
what about sugar-free lemonade no because that has all kinds of other like chemical

787
02:51:39,110 --> 02:51:52,819
bullshit in it you well you don't want either sugar-free water sugar sugar-free lemonade has

788
02:51:52,819 --> 02:51:58,260
like if it has to it's got like fucking xylitol in it or like aspartame and you just hey just

789
02:51:58,260 --> 02:52:14,180
be natural for god's sake squeeze a lemon xylophone your body doesn't filter the fake

790
02:52:14,180 --> 02:52:25,670
sugars very well that's true but i wish you a quick recovery hopefully you pass them

have to get an intercostal nerve block it's an injection into one of my nerves kind of sucks

805
02:54:17,020 --> 02:54:27,940
annoying issue but we'll see if pt does it are you paying two thousand dollars for 15 minute

point costochondritis so that they could just be like because people do ask about it a lot and i

810
02:55:04,149 --> 02:55:14,629
just don't want to ignore them uh bulbous swag thanks for the 500 bits hey gamer do you think

811
02:55:14,629 --> 02:55:19,190
it's more economically sound to save my channel points for the next big wink channel points thing

812
02:55:19,190 --> 02:55:24,870
or use my points now also i had a theory that you only introduce winks so you'd have to wear clothes

813
02:55:26,040 --> 02:55:39,319
well i mean i i didn't mean to do that that's that's sort of a an issue is me needing to wear

814
02:55:39,319 --> 02:55:46,280
clothes and have to turn the facecam on every stream i mean that's the big problem who is that

815
02:55:47,159 --> 02:55:52,920
oh you want to get out of here you want to get out he wants to get out hold on give me one second

816
02:55:52,920 --> 02:56:32,420
want to go outside where to go all right what was what was it was so do is it more economically

817
02:56:32,420 --> 02:56:38,020
sound hey you do whatever you want to do with your channel points uh the new thing that replaces

818
02:56:38,020 --> 02:56:44,889
wink is i guarantee is not going to be substantially more interesting than the wink it's gonna it's

819
02:56:44,889 --> 02:56:59,750
probably going to be like read a popsicle joke like people have suggested but thank you you're

820
02:56:59,750 --> 02:57:06,889
gonna need hundreds of jokes no no i don't think so the wings only happen five to ten times the

821
02:57:06,889 --> 02:57:16,250
stream anyways hey peaceful haley thanks for the 250 also found out i have a hiatal hernia as well

822
02:57:16,250 --> 02:57:20,489
that explains my other stomach pains i'm glad i finally have my questions answered hope you

823

824
02:57:26,280 --> 02:57:34,299
sorry to hear that yeah i have i have a hiatal hernia but it's i have been told it's not big

825
02:57:34,299 --> 02:57:42,389
enough to be that much of a concern and it's not what's causing my problems that's what the

826
02:57:42,389 --> 02:57:49,700
doctor said he's like that's not what you're why you're feeling like shit and like really he's

827
02:57:49,700 --> 02:57:53,940
like yeah you have one but it's not big enough to really truly be causing the pain and you're like

828
02:57:53,940 --> 02:58:05,819
you're back in ribs i'm like oh okay there was a wink oh well i can hold on shit i didn't know on

829
02:58:05,819 --> 02:58:13,059
the small patches of land that remain above the sea the people of this world it's hard to just

830
02:58:13,059 --> 02:58:20,579
wink it is driven by quantum refractors a powerful energy i can't it's hard to do it it in a world

831
02:58:20,579 --> 02:58:25,940
ancient ruins underground and in the starship fix it thanks to five dollars i literally just

838
02:58:55,299 --> 02:59:00,899
bugleberry cameo to stream but i'm pretty sure that chat loved it they have a loving relationship

839
02:59:01,379 --> 02:59:08,020
a treasure so great but if it were discovered it would provide so much power that the world never

840
02:59:08,020 --> 02:59:14,659
thank you flood boy for the five dollars seeking the mother load the diggers traveled from one

dark soul thanks for the 250 i forgot to make this donation during the first megaman legend

852
03:00:59,909 --> 03:01:06,309
stream but the fact that your point of reference for his son drears with tron is angelica from

853
03:01:06,309 --> 03:01:17,319
rugrats is the most fucking cursed shit i've ever heard what what are you talking about she

854
03:01:17,319 --> 03:01:22,409

860
03:02:13,540 --> 03:02:19,620
sucks germa sucks is one of the one of the big uh community sub contributors to this stream

861
03:02:20,180 --> 03:02:28,739
and let's get them on the screen pumped you sorry i did the wrong noise it was supposed to be

862
03:02:35,159 --> 03:02:49,829
whoops here they are they my computer has been a piece of shit lately have i i've never talked

863
03:02:49,829 --> 03:03:00,309
about that have i have time for an upgrade what do i have i have a 1080 is 1080 still good i

864
03:03:00,309 --> 03:03:04,469
have a regular just a regular 1080 it's still good right i don't need to upgrade what the fuck

865
03:03:04,469 --> 03:03:18,250
cares here comes credits thanks everybody for subbing that's my cpu uh it's an i768

866
03:03:18,809 --> 03:03:30,729
i have it it's listed here right it's like a six core i7 isn't it i76850 btx 1080 hybrid what does

867
03:03:30,729 --> 03:03:47,819
that mean no i don't need to upgrade i'm fine get a thread ripper yeah the plan eventually is to get

868
03:03:48,780 --> 03:03:58,010
like a monster cpu so i can do a higher um quality instead of streaming because i stream at 720 60

869
03:03:58,569 --> 03:04:07,500
i'd like to go to like 960 900p 1080 i still don't like the idea of doing 1080 i don't think it looks

870
03:04:07,500 --> 03:04:15,059
good at the bit rate that twitch allows you to use and with a he but a thread ripper or something

871
03:04:15,059 --> 03:04:19,620
i could probably drop my preset to make it look really good and make it at somewhere on 900p

872
03:04:20,659 --> 03:04:36,120
because with 1080 twitch only allows 6 000 up to if you go more than that they actually don't like

873
03:04:36,120 --> 03:04:43,690
it at all so anything more than 6 000 up if you have you have a 1080p stream and you're not

874
03:04:44,329 --> 03:04:50,579
at somewhere or at like eight to ten thousand up for a bit rate it's just i it's not i don't

875
03:04:50,579 --> 03:05:05,739
think it's worth doing so i would be somewhere probably around 900 i don't know this computer

876
03:05:05,739 --> 03:05:12,200
talk what's happening we're just talking about uh computers and how fast they are you get a lot

877
03:05:12,200 --> 03:05:16,920
of encoding crossed on action games yeah you could do like 1080 30 but i don't want to do 1080 30

878
03:05:17,719 --> 03:05:33,049
i'd rather stay at 60 but um thank you everybody for stopping appreciate it i think we're so far

879
03:05:33,049 --> 03:05:40,010
beyond 30 fps at this point as the internet has grows and progresses here and how we consume all

880
03:05:40,010 --> 03:05:48,940
this media 30 fps i don't think is it's like well you're at 30 fps i think most people almost

881
03:05:48,940 --> 03:05:59,620
everybody streams at 60 nowadays and this stream has been streaming 60 fps for three four plus

882
03:05:59,620 --> 03:06:05,620
years so it'd be really weird to be like oh by the way i'm at 1080 but uh my i'm at 30 fps now

883
03:06:06,260 --> 03:06:20,649
but anyways let's uh let's move this and go to the end so we're at the end i will see you all

884
03:06:21,209 --> 03:06:27,979
tomorrow 2 p.m but we have 250 from c4g i hit legend in hearthstone for the first time yesterday

885
03:06:27,979 --> 03:06:33,829
and i'm dedicating this victory to you the chicken league champion will never stream hearthstone

886
03:06:33,829 --> 03:06:41,750
again it was fun while it lasted though erdemious thanks for the 250 hey i don't care what chat says

887
03:06:41,750 --> 03:06:45,670
bugleberry is the greatest character to ever grace the stream i love all of his appearances

888
03:06:45,670 --> 03:06:49,989
on the stream do you have any pointers on where i could find a mask that looks like him i really

889
03:06:49,989 --> 03:06:59,350
want to cosplay him i actually don't i don't i uh that that mask is not readily available

890
03:07:01,290 --> 03:07:07,620
because you're talking about somebody's face uh there's not a mask of bugleberry's face

891
03:07:09,540 --> 03:07:14,260
why would there be a mask of that it's not like a president or something

892
03:07:15,059 --> 03:07:30,520
what what do you munk a essay he's a pop culture icon no he's not is he
