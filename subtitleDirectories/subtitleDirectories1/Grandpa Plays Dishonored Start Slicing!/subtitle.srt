00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:17,699
Hello there, ladies and gentlemen. It's Grampa here. And today, I've got some Dishonored for you. It's a fantastic game.

2
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:26,699
I actually, I haven't played one second of the game, so I don't know if it's good or not. But I'm just gonna say it's good for the purpose of the fucking video.

3
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:33,060
So let's do it, huh? I've been drinking all morning in preparation for this game. So let's have some fun!

4
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:39,140
See, the cool part about this game is you can talk to everybody.

5
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,140
You're all talking at the same time, though. You shut the fuck up. I'm trying to listen to this guy.

6
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,950
I'm drinking this. That was his, I think. He doesn't even care.

7
00:00:51,950 --> 00:01:03,520
Oh, hello there, Suzy. Look at this beautiful woman. Is this my wife? God, I hope so. Look at you.

8
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:09,519
I hope that one of the other cities had dealt with this before. Knew of some cure. This news is very bad.

9
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:12,519
At the breaking point.

10
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:15,519
Cowards. They're going to block you.

11
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:18,519
They'll wait to see if the plague turns this city into a graveyard.

12
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:20,519
Yeah, that sucks. I know, me too.

13
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:24,420
Wait, what? What happened?

14
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,420
Don't worry, darling.

15
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,420
Everything's fine. Your mother's fine.

16
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,420
Wait, where are the guards? Who sent them away?

17
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,420
What do you mean?

18
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,420
Who sent them away?

19
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,420
I am the guard.

20
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,689
What? What are they doing?

21
00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:35,689
What the hell is that?

22
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:36,689
Oh, it's ninjas.

23
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:38,689
How am I going to fight the ninjas now?

24
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:39,689
Come on, left clickers, attack.

25
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:40,689
All right, don't worry, sweetie.

26
00:01:40,689 --> 00:01:42,689
I got you. Get the fuck away from here.

27
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:43,689
Come on. Come at me.

28
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:45,689
I got to come around this corner.

29
00:01:52,689 --> 00:01:56,180
Okay, so the game wants me to be stealthy right here.

30
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,180
But I say, nope, I'm just going to run in and start slicing.

31
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,180
Because, you know, are they really going to kill me?

32
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,180
Three versus one?

33
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,180
I'm supposed to be a superhuman son of a bitch.

34
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,180
We'll see what happens.

35
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,180
Let's go in.

36
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,550
Hey, buddy.

37
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:11,550
Eat that, that's your neck.

38
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,550
Oh, sorry, did I cut off your balls?

39
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,550
What about you too?

40
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:17,550
Jeez, stealth, I will never use stealth ever.

41
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,550
I just killed this whole room in two seconds.

42
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:24,199
Okay, I don't know what this guy's doing,

43
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:26,199
but it is freaking me out right now.

44
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:29,199
I'm seriously going to start fucking hallucinating.

45
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:31,199
This guy has just been doing this the whole time.

46
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,569
What are you doing, man?

47
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:34,870
What are you doing?

48
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,870
Please stop doing that.

49
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,110
Going through the sewers, having tons of fun.

50
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,110
Going through...

51
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,110
What the hell is this?

52
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,669
Oh my God.

53
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:47,669
Are those rats?

54
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,919
Oh, oh, they're just bones and muscle now.

55
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:55,219
Oh, hold on.

56
00:02:55,219 --> 00:02:56,219
Where's the box?

57
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:57,219
Is this a horror game?

58
00:02:57,219 --> 00:03:01,219
Is this one of those horror games that takes like an hour before it starts to scare you?

59
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:03,219
I'm not playing this fucking game.

60
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:04,219
Doc's here.

61
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:05,219
No, no way.

62
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:06,219
I'm not playing a horror game.

63
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:08,219
I'm not playing that.

64
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:10,870
And the chase is on.

65
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:11,870
Got to get out of here.

66
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:12,870
Come on, come on.

67
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:13,870
The music means you got to run fast.

68
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,870
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

69
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,870
Actually, I heard people behind me.

70
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,870
I think there's a couple of assholes behind me.

71
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:19,870
Hold on.

72
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:20,870
Stay here.

73
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:21,870
Stay here.

74
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:22,870
Let's go.

75
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:23,870
Come on.

76
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,870
I'm going to kill you.

77
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,870
You're going to get a sword in your face.

78
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:28,870
See you later.

79
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:29,870
I blocked that.

80
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:30,870
Come on.

81
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,870
Try harder.

82
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,870
You guys are terrible.

83
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:33,870
How ab...

84
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,870
Who brings a fucking gun to a knife fight?

85
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,870
We were having a genuine knife fight.

86
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:39,870
And you brought...

87
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,870
You bring out a gun.

88
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,870
Where's my gun?

89
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,870
Oh, I didn't...

90
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:43,870
Where's my machine gun?

91
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,870
How come I don't have one and you do?

92
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,110
God damn it.

93
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:49,310
Whatever.

94
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:52,319
I got to go to the store anyways.
