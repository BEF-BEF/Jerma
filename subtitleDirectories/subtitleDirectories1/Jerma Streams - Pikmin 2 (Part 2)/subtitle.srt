1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:13,640
I was an hour late. Wait, what? I was an hour late? Where? What? No, it's just one.

2
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:18,289
I just had like a heart attack. I was like, wait, what are you talking about?

3
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:27,980
It was 1pm, right? I'm like seven minutes late. You know, Otto did the thing where he

4
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:33,700
walked around and smelled every smell and spun around three times, spun around three

5
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:40,929
times. Nope, not here. Found another place to smell. Spin around, spin around this way.

6
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:50,100
This is it. This is the place. No, it's not. And then finally took a fucking dump. He's

7
00:00:50,100 --> 00:01:00,829
smelling all the smelly smells. Savory dog. I don't need to go over that again. I don't

8
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:11,159
need to go over that. Yeah, I'm gonna take care of Otto. Right, Otto? Oh, he needs his

9
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:46,109
bed in here. Okay. Show us Otto. No, I can't because I don't have any clothes on. No, no

10
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:55,409
cam at all. I don't have any clothing on. Fucking put them on. No, I'm not going to put on

11
00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:03,349
clothes. You can't make me put clothes on. Okay. I am a voice inside of your head right

12
00:02:03,349 --> 00:02:11,620
now. I'm talking to you. Just a voice. I don't have to have a body attached. Just a voice.

13
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:21,800
Okay. Anyways, we're gonna continue Pikmin 2. I'm having fun with it. I think it's a fun

14
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:28,500
game. I have a few things to tell you. One specifically, I hope I'm not jumping the gun

15
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,860
on this. Because we've just been essentially confirmed that it's probably going to happen

16
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:46,819
on this day. So I, I may or may not be jumping the gun. So keep that in mind. The archaeologist

17
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:59,780
stream is potentially like 80% confirmed to be on. Mark your calendar here. March 6th

18
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:18,569
of 2021. It's gonna be fun. Not cat boy. No, it is not cat boy. But I could be in a cat

19
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:25,939
boy outfit. I will not be in a cat boy outfit on that stream. Let me make sure I get the

20
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:35,990
record straight there. He's gonna find a cat boy fossil skeleton. Well, thanks for the

21
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:39,469
fucking free joke because there's a there's a bunch of jokes that are going to happen

22
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:44,750
on that stream. Thanks for another one. I credit that to you the person that just said

23
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:49,860
that because that would be kind of funny. Okay, I got to see if I can make that work.

24
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:59,740
But it should be fun. I again, I don't want to jump the gun because we've been working

25
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:04,580
diligently on trying to get this to happen. And over the next couple of weeks, especially

26
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:10,979
going to be doing a lot of stuff on it. So just to let you know, it's probably happening

27
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:16,699
on March 6th. I don't jump with the gun. I don't want to jump the gun. I know. I'm sorry.

28
00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:20,220
I get on a phrase and I stay on it for like 10 minutes and then I never say that phrase

29
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:39,740
again. Oh, yeah. Pick me up today. Don't forget to tweet. Oh, fuck. Thank you. Thank you for

30
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:45,819
reminding me to open Twitter. I open Twitter like once every four days or three days or

31
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:53,060
something. That's a lie. What a liar. I look at it every day. Yeah, I don't even like use

32
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:59,220
technology. I don't even like use Twitter. That's a liar. I look at it every day, at

33
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:04,069
least like in the evening when I'm about to go to bed. Okay, what should we title this

34
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:13,540
Pikmin? Pikmin 2 continues our epic journey. I'm not going to put the last part, but you

35
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:29,089
get it. Let's tweet this. Why does Twitter do this shit? I don't like when Twitter does

36
00:05:29,089 --> 00:05:36,000
that. It like it gives a link before I'm done writing. That's annoying. How dare it do

37
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,269
that? All right. Yeah, I'm into Pikmin 2. I can't say that what will happen after today,

38
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:51,750
but maybe I'll still be into it. Make sure I get that right. Okay. Facecam. I cannot

39
00:05:51,750 --> 00:06:04,459
put a facecam on. You can play Yakuza again. That's the plan. Also, I don't have a date for

40
00:06:04,459 --> 00:06:11,540
this, but the Minecraft server, the actual Germacraft Minecraft server is imminent as

41
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:24,620
well. It's beautiful. It is absolutely beautiful. It's a gorgeous server. So look for

42
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:29,579
that too soon. We'll be talking about that in detail over the next probably three or four

43
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:41,569
weeks. Just take a quick sip out of my bottle. Will you visit it from time to time on stream?

44
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:54,740
That's the plan. The plan is to visit that once a month, maybe. Maybe or so. Once every

45
00:06:54,740 --> 00:07:01,220
couple months and go see what people are doing. Because in the last FTK stream, it was very

46
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:08,800
clear that the second half was way more interesting to a lot of you than the first. That's the

47
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,160
plan is to kind of do something like that. Again, I just wanted to bring this up because

48
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:19,000
I brought it up like maybe a month ago is the last time. Two months ago. Isn't it where we

49
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,079
talked about it last? There is no date for this, but just know that like probably within the

50
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:29,560
next couple of months, it will be a Germacraft server up and running that you can play on.

51
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:38,129
It's getting close. It's getting closer. We need a Hue cam. No, you don't need any cam. In fact,

52
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:43,209
I'm going to make sure like the cameras are on. I hate that knowing that that could just be turned

53
00:07:43,209 --> 00:07:55,639
on. We already saw this. In my OBS preview, I can look over here and see that the cam is ready.

54
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,120
And the camera is physically pointing at me and the lights are on. So it's just like this shit is

55
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:10,920
on. The lights are just lit up, just ready to capture me naked. I'm not even naked though.

56
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:22,250
You know what? Here's like what I can tell you. Okay. You know how you go to sleep every night?

57
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:28,310
That's how I'm dressed. I have pajama pants on and no shirt. That's just what I do. That's how

58
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:43,980
I live every day. Pajama pants and no shirt on. That's how humans sleep. Just unplug the camera.

59
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:51,049
No, because then if I unplug it, I crash OBS. All right. So we left off. I had just gotten the

60
00:08:51,049 --> 00:08:56,889
blue Pikmin. I'm very excited. Can you hear it in my voice? Yay. Can't wait to fucking play this

61
00:08:56,889 --> 00:09:07,860
game again. I want to go here. He's bored already. I want to go because there's some water things in

62
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:24,789
here, right? No, wait. No, I don't. How many water Pikmin do I have? Can I see? He hates

63
00:09:24,789 --> 00:09:33,019
it. I'm just going to go here. Whatever. I think I have enough water Pikmin. I should have like 20,

64
00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:47,610
right? Only because they're perplexing. Boom. That you're creepy. Already said chat. You are wicked

65
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:56,970
creepy. All right. What do we got here? Citadel of spiders. Now there's a water thing to do here.

66
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:02,330
Let me just, let me take a look around first. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's get some

67
00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:15,059
good look. All 18 of them more like wicked fucked wicked. Oh dude. I'll do that. That would be wicked

68
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:37,830
funny. And the electricity do 30 electric. And then we have some big boys, right? How many big

69
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:46,570
boys do I have? Ooh, that's not good. Only five. What happened? What happened to the big guys?

70
00:10:49,539 --> 00:10:56,659
Stewie. Ooh, what happened to the big ones? Brian, didn't we have 20 purple pick?

71
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:03,559
We did Stewie, but you killed them all. No, I didn't kill them. You did. Okay. Let's go.

72
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:11,720
All right. Let's go over here. Everybody fucking hates family guy. You all like family guy.

73
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:18,519
We talked about this like two months ago. Family guy. You all hate it. Oh, shut up. I hate Stewie,

74
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:24,120
but you'll watch it on TBS every day. I know all of you watch adult swim and family guys on adult

75
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:30,019
swim. Like family guy is the teen Titans of adult swim. You watch it every time it's on.

76
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:48,980
No, you don't. You don't. Bridge. Okay, here we go. Uh, let's kill this guy. Only boomers.

77
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:53,940
Family guy literally sucks. Yeah, but it doesn't that doesn't matter. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

78
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,139
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

79
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:59,940
Bring everybody over here. No, just purples. Bring everybody. Fuck it. Whatever.

80
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:04,840
That guy's gonna jump on me. I know it. All right, let's kill all this stuff.

81
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:23,110
Boomers. Wait, is Adult Swim Boomer? No? I was under the impression that it wasn't. Kill it.

82
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:35,610
There we go. No! It kind of is. You know, maybe I am getting a little older because I turned on

83
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:42,570
Adult Swim recently and I thought all the shows were just fucking terrible. Is that- am I getting

84
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:52,820
old? Because I used to watch it all the time. They are. Okay, well hopefully this guy doesn't

85
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:59,460
kill me. I need the- we need to build this bridge. I'm gonna leave Louie over here in case they

86
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:09,590
attack. Louie, come over here. Just in case this guy attacks, I gotta be ready for it.

87
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:18,539
Yeah, I mean, Erica- I like Eric Andre. I think he's funny. But I don't- I don't really think

88
00:13:18,539 --> 00:13:25,659
anything else is. Don't attack. Don't attack. Don't attack. Don't attack. Don't attack. Don't

89
00:13:25,659 --> 00:13:33,029
attack. Don't! There's treasure here too. Oh shit. I need that because I want these guys to be-

90
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:43,830
Yes! All right, I'm ready to drink it. Rick and Morty Rea. Okay, all right, fine. When Rick

91
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:49,029
and Morty airs every three years, I guess sure you could watch it. Is he just gonna fight me?

92
00:13:49,909 --> 00:13:59,399
Is he gonna- he is. He is. He is. He is. All right, you know what? Just kill him. Go for it.

93
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:21,509
We can do it. Are we gonna come back? No, come back! I'm fine. Don't crush him. I don't know what it

94
00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:26,230
is. You know, you know you could title this video for the second channel? Because by the way, if

95
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:30,710
you're not subscribed to the second channel, what are you doing? What are you thinking?

96
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:50,889
Kill. Kill. Kill. Kill. Kill it. Kill it. I'm so afraid of him squashing. He's gonna do it.

97
00:14:50,889 --> 00:15:01,080
Just wait for him to do it. There it is. Kill. Got it. Nice. Perfect. All right, now build a bridge.

98
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:10,700
You're scared of a frog? Yes. Because if it squashes them then I only have like 15 of these

99
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:19,860
guys. 20 of these guys. Aha! All right, good. Yeah, bring this back too. Don't go in the water,

100
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:24,950
go over the bridge. All right, now what's over here? There's treasure over here, right?

101
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:40,740
Where my white? I'm gonna dig? Wait, what? Wait, was the whole point of that to- huh. What was

102
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:48,470
the point of coming over here with the bridge? Can I break this? Why would there be a bridge over here?

103
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:56,470
I could throw yellow over there? Yeah, I could, but wouldn't they- was it just to throw yellow

104
00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:07,539
over the bridge? They're not gonna get stuck over there, are they? I hope not. They're not gonna get

105
00:16:07,539 --> 00:16:32,149
stuck over here, right? Are they gonna get stuck over here? They'll bring that down? Oh my god,

106
00:16:32,149 --> 00:16:47,129
we gotta go. What are they doing? It's all right. I'll get it. It's off locked? Well, not yet. Hold

107
00:16:47,129 --> 00:16:56,710
on. Don't drown. Um, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay, okay, okay. I'm good. I'm good.

108
00:16:57,429 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm gonna sit here for a sec and then I'm gonna call these guys back. All right, now go over there

109
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:15,319
and- my mouth peaked. My mouth peaked. Did you hear that shit? That was not my microphone,

110
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:22,119
that was my mouth. I peaked the inside of my microphone, my mouth. That was fucking crazy.

111
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:35,799
Are they doing it? All right, break up for a second. All right, and then I'm gonna- so then

112
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:41,269
I'm gonna- how am I gonna get them back over here? I could throw them. I need blue to take- to pick

113
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:57,430
that up. Wait, what? Can I go over this way? I don't know, can they? I wanna- I kind of want to

114
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:02,500
hear that. The noise I've made with my mouth and my saliva or something sounded like a peaked

115
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:11,319
microphone. Throw them over? I can throw- yeah, but I don't want to touch the electric fence.

116
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:28,630
I wish I could move the camera like Mario 64. Don't I have more of these? Where are the other

117
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:44,730
blue ones? They all back at the ship? Uh, they are. Louie, go get them. Go get them, Louie.

118
00:18:44,730 --> 00:19:05,670
Why is he- are they fighting him? Uh, where's the pace out there? All right, come back. Oh,

119
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:11,849
hold on. Is he playing on the Wii? I am playing on the Wii U, to be exact.

120
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:22,940
Okay, so now, anybody- any stragglers? I don't think so. I just have to go straight this way.

121
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:46,420
Wait, can I cross the bridge? Uh, no. Wait, can I? No. I won't fight him, just run. Oh, title of the

122
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:51,700
video. The title- what's the title of the video? The title of the video is gonna be Overreactor.

123
00:19:53,190 --> 00:20:01,160
Pikmin Overreactor, because that's what I'm doing. I'm just like, whoa! It's like a kid's game.

124
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:06,390
Why am I, like, trying to make it sound so much more dramatic? I'm not even trying to, though. I

125
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:14,920
promise. All right, here we go. Who's dying? Oh my god! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

126
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:27,990
Okay, Pikmin Overreactor. I'm sorry. I just did the exact thing that I told you. All right,

127
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:37,289
everybody relax. Come here. I only want the exact fucking thing I was talking about. All right,

128
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:44,069
can you guys get this? 15. All right, get it. Nice. The rest of you need to be thrown.

129
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:59,420
Don't pull it into the- what are you, dumb? Oh my god. All right, well, today's almost over anyways.

130
00:21:05,509 --> 00:21:15,289
Pikmin Overreactor. And the thumbnail can be like a nuclear reactor. And it going off,

131
00:21:15,289 --> 00:21:33,940
and it has my face kind of embedded into it going like, whoa! Oh god, perfect timing on his part.

132
00:21:34,819 --> 00:21:48,339
Kill him! Oh my god. He almost just splash damage killed everybody. I'm missing anybody?

133
00:21:48,980 --> 00:22:04,660
Jeremy, when are you gonna come out with a vegan burger? Um, I'm not. I'm sorry to disappoint you.

134
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:14,069
All right, hold on. These- these idiots just put five- a five blue coin into a red box.

135
00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:23,750
Did they just mess that up? That's basic colors. They took the blue coin and put it in a red box.

136
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:40,940
Does that matter? Stop! It does matter, doesn't it? Pikmin carry stuff to their own onion, dummy.

137
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:50,359
That was a blue coin. Why would they do that? Can they not see blue? Can they not see the color

138
00:22:50,359 --> 00:23:01,660
blue? There's a red majority carrying it. But I thought- what, what red majority cannot put the

139
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:14,900
blue coin into the blue container? Why not? All right, we'll have to remember that next time.

140
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:20,700
I'm bringing way less reds next time, by the way. They just overpower everything, and I need-

141
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:26,809
I need, like, a few more purples. Because they just keep- they pick up everything,

142
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:34,329
and they just take everything. All right, I'm good. At least I got a treasure.

143
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:51,589
Politics? Okay, well then Team Fortress 2 is politics. That's red versus blue. It's always

144
00:23:51,589 --> 00:23:58,460
like fucking Halo, okay? Every video game ever that had the two contrasting red and blue colors

145
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:17,460
versus each other. They just got to get rid of the politics in those games. Base? That's not even-

146
00:24:18,019 --> 00:24:27,349
That's not base? That's just- what? You just ruined all video games.

147
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:41,819
That was a flame ball back? What? I can't even believe it. 140. I keep putting a drink down in

148
00:24:41,819 --> 00:24:50,740
front of my Wii sensor bar, and it keeps screwing everything up. Some say that you should look to

149
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:56,660
the past, to places you have been already, in order to make new finds. Of course, extraordinary

150
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:10,009
people like me always press onward. And scroll down, it's got one like on it. And by the way,

151
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:33,140
that's like the 30th time they've posted today. Here, go back here. In fact, you can use fire

152
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:43,690
as a Wii sensor bar. Oh yeah, sorry, you can put candles up, right? Like to own post. Boomer Twitter?

153
00:25:44,329 --> 00:25:57,079
No. Yeah, and then there was one comment. It's just, are you coming over for dinner tomorrow?

154
00:25:58,309 --> 00:26:24,059
It's like grandma. No, less red. I want a blue- I want a blue majority. I don't want a red

155
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:50,950
majority. Look, go ahead. You can't clip it out. He's just a psycho. Someone's going to just take

156
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:57,589
that and be like, I knew he was a Democrat. Who even cares? I don't even really fucking care.

157
00:26:58,549 --> 00:27:04,329
I'm playing Pikmin 2. Does anybody actually give a shit about where I might lean politically?

158
00:27:04,329 --> 00:27:21,750
Anybody even care? He's finally lost it. Okay, I don't need to bring a hundred people.

159
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:35,079
This would be good. Who needs to be- who needs to drink? Of course we do. All right,

160
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:39,480
where should I go in here? What's this place? A cavern? I got the bridge. Now what's over here?

161
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:56,539
I made that reference probably a hundred times. Oh, these are new. These are new bugs. Get them.

162
00:27:57,259 --> 00:28:13,980
Didn't get a chance to eat them. Good. Okay, you know where to take that. Okay, now that's open.

163
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:26,339
Is there anything even in there besides that? It might be a secret in there. Just empty. Okay,

164
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:33,000
but I can go over here. Oh, another electric fence over there. All right, we're going to go this way.

165
00:28:34,460 --> 00:29:11,019
Uh oh, here's the worst thing, the worst part about this. I want to be Louie down there.

166
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:19,910
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I hate this fucking thing. Why do I even put the elevator in this?

167
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:23,509
Like, I know you want to like, oh, you're way down with the big ones. Who cares?

168
00:29:24,069 --> 00:29:33,720
This is stupid. I hate this. No, I don't. Stop coming with me. Stop coming with me.

169
00:29:40,680 --> 00:30:14,250
Hey, kill it. Come on. Way him down. Kill it. Way it down. Oh my God. Kill it. Thank you. No,

170
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:19,269
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Hold on. First, let me hit C, then one, then C,

171
00:30:19,269 --> 00:30:24,539
then A, then B. Just send the other guy. Who cares? Why is this guy even in the game?

172
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:36,140
Stop doing that. I told you to stop. Oh my God. Why did you come over here? I don't. Stop picking

173
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:53,259
that up. Put it down. Go. We lost a bug. I don't care. I put Louie in this game to sell toys.

174
00:30:53,259 --> 00:31:33,000
That's the only reason why he's here. Drink up. He hates Louie. What's over here? Is Louie in

175
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:44,789
Pikmin 3 as a playable character? I want to just... Yes or no? No. Okay. That's all I needed to know.

176
00:31:44,789 --> 00:32:06,470
That's the only thing I need to know. Watch out. Drink it. What is... Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

177
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:17,859
There's not enough here. Speaking of Louie, you go back here and go get everybody. There we go.

178
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:36,259
He's sold? By the way, why does the whistle work on people? Hold on. I'm gonna zoom out. How come

179
00:32:36,259 --> 00:32:54,339
I can use the whistle on Louie? It works on you too. Yeah, I don't want the whistle to work on me.

180
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:57,779
If I'm gonna have two separate captains, I don't want the B look to be like, hey, you...

181
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:19,769
Oh my God, Nintendo. Why does every... Oh, I'm already getting mad at the fucking controls.

182
00:33:19,769 --> 00:33:39,349
A is throw and A is also grab. Use the bridge. Does it not go over here? I thought the bridge

183
00:33:39,349 --> 00:34:04,039
didn't go over here. All right. Everybody fucking get over here. We good? All right. Let's go.

184
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:18,820
I want yellows. Look at that great traction. Go over here. Take that down. You got killed.

185
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:28,630
You died. I just fell down here. Oh shit. I can't go back up. Okay. Well, I'm gonna go this way.

186
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:40,780
Avoid the frog. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't go over there. Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie.

187
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:57,059
Oh my God. No, no, no. Come on. You're okay. You're okay. Everyone's fine. All right. Go.

188
00:34:57,059 --> 00:35:20,329
Take it down. I want Louie bait him over here. Thank God he's in the game. Thank God I have this.

189
00:35:21,289 --> 00:35:30,420
Thank God I can do this. Everything I said previously, I take back completely.

190
00:35:31,059 --> 00:35:39,780
There's a cave in there. Oh, okay. Cool. All right. Now come over here and weigh this thing

191
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:45,699
down so I can go up. It's almost done. Then I'm going to grab everybody and we're going to go in

192
00:35:45,699 --> 00:36:00,019
the hole. I'm just distracting this, uh, Pollywog, whatever it is. Don't kill Louie.

193
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:11,059
You know what? Like, whatever. Don't jump over there. At least do a face cam. I'm not putting

194
00:36:11,059 --> 00:36:21,860
on a face cam. Gooey, gooey, gooey, Louie. Yeah, that's the booger. That's the one with the boogers.

195
00:36:23,539 --> 00:36:31,030
Okay. Everybody come with me. All right. We need somebody to go back and get the rest.

196
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:38,409
All right, Louie. I'll get them. No, I'll get them. All of them are. Uh, I have to go around.

197
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:47,800
Don't go up there and kill everybody, please. Okay. I need you guys to come help me knock this.

198
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:59,480
Not all of you. Oh, God damn it. Oh, God. No. What the fuck? What the fuck, man?

199
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:17,909
It's just so sad. It's fun when I can collect coins and stuff. I don't want to micromanage

200
00:37:17,909 --> 00:37:35,719
5,000 fucking people. There's a treasure over here, but I don't care. I want to go in the cave.

201
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:45,269
All right. Where are we at? Where's the other team? Where's the other guy?

202
00:37:45,269 --> 00:38:03,579
Okay. Over here. Can I get over there from here? Okay. Here we go. Holy shit. All right. I'm going

203
00:38:03,579 --> 00:38:13,369
to get in the cave. Everybody drink? Everybody's drank. Okay. Let's go. It also doesn't help that

204
00:38:13,369 --> 00:38:32,070
the whole ground looks just like I have a thousand upload right now. Strong scent. Okay.

205
00:38:34,219 --> 00:38:44,679
You're both drooling. I wish just once. Is there food down here? 88 out of 88. That's good. Um,

206
00:38:44,679 --> 00:39:03,940
let's do it. Let's go with the whole squad. I thought this was supposed to be a family

207
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:18,809
friendly stream. Is it? All right. What we got? I only have a few. I hope there's not a lot of

208
00:39:18,809 --> 00:39:35,320
fire here. Uh, what's over there? Shit. Okay. Where's purple? Well, everybody back. Come on.

209
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:46,679
Back, back, back, back, back, back, back. He died? Why are you even over there? Oh my God.

210
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:57,340
Well, I got to, I got to turn my body and rest my arm on the stupid thing again.

211
00:39:59,349 --> 00:40:05,449
Remember I'm holding out the remote like a remote control permanently. Oh, I'm already getting

212
00:40:05,449 --> 00:40:21,320
annoyed by this, like upset by this. All right. I'm, I'm, my wrist is resting and I'm in a position

213
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:32,059
where the sensor bar can see it. Oh, let me see if I can do this. All right. All right. I'm good.

214
00:40:32,619 --> 00:40:44,860
Give me purple. Purple, please. No, just everybody in. Everybody in. Just go overwhelm them with

215
00:40:44,860 --> 00:41:03,659
overwhelming numbers. Go. Good. All right. Bring them back. I'm losing the sensor.

216
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:22,070
Only three purples are alive. That's okay. I'll get them. I'll get more. Let me move the sensor

217
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:38,860
bar to like here. Will that help? Maybe. Maybe a little. All right. Where's the treasure? Oh,

218
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:48,869
okay. It's like a glue stick. He's fucking angry. Wait, are they going to get trapped in here?

219
00:41:54,039 --> 00:42:00,619
Damn. Trying to aim with this fucking thing is so hard. I feel like I'm doing surgery

220
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:19,349
to try to throw a Pikmin over a goddamn bridge and they climb. Oh, I can get out this way, right?

221
00:42:23,829 --> 00:42:26,949
My grandma had an easy time using the Wii because she played for 15 minutes

222
00:42:28,389 --> 00:42:31,909
once and then it sat on her shelf. She played it for like 10 minutes.

223
00:42:32,469 --> 00:42:46,070
Total. She may be maybe one hour of total game time ever. Oh, that was worth a lot.

224
00:42:53,940 --> 00:43:07,159
Wrong. It was a gamer grandma. What would a gamer grandma be? You're weaker than a grandma.

225
00:43:13,449 --> 00:43:22,300
I don't even know what he's talking about. My forearm doesn't start to burn after 25 minutes

226
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:28,300
of holding it in the same place. I do just fine with my Wiimote. Thank you, grandson.

227
00:43:30,489 --> 00:43:41,719
Lactic acid doesn't exist. It's a made up term that's a scientist made up. What is this?

228
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:56,579
Go in there? No, no, no. That's cope. I don't care. I don't care what it is.

229
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:02,380
Easy, easy, easy, easy. Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run. There's so many

230
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:21,929
weird mutant creatures in here. All right, get them. Those things are not violent. I gotta

231
00:44:21,929 --> 00:44:39,719
kill this thing. It has to die. But okay, easy. He killed an innocent creature.

232
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:55,929
Now, is anything of a truly innocent? All right, let's start collecting. Where is this? Hey,

233
00:44:56,889 --> 00:45:16,139
that's our fruit. He got it. He actually got it. He stole it. He stole it from us. Get away.

234
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:35,510
Don't touch that. Isn't he a Pikmin, does he? I don't think so. Okay, let's keep going. They're

235
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:39,429
just irritating. They're not really that scary. They kind of just get in the way. Is that a purple

236
00:45:39,429 --> 00:46:13,019
flower? Thank God it is. Get that bottle cap. Hold on. I don't have any idea how much that

237
00:46:13,019 --> 00:46:22,329
hurts to aim up there and keep it right there. I'm so glad this shit died. I'm so happy that

238
00:46:22,329 --> 00:46:25,530
everyone thought we were going to go to... Oh man, motion controls are going to take over.

239
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:29,929
It's going to be what everybody... No, no, it's not. The PS5 controller is a fucking controller.

240
00:46:29,929 --> 00:46:32,650
It's a regular goddamn controller. I'm so glad we didn't go from here.

241
00:46:33,449 --> 00:46:45,289
What about VR? VR is completely different. VR is like your actual hands.

242
00:46:45,929 --> 00:46:54,420
I'm not pointing an ice cream sandwich at a fucking red sensor. That's what this thing is.

243
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:57,539
It's a heat sensor. Whatever the hell it is. I don't know. I have no idea what this is.

244
00:46:57,539 --> 00:47:02,019
It's a camera. It's a heat camera. Thermal camera. Whatever the hell it is.

245
00:47:03,989 --> 00:47:25,300
Infrared. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what I meant. Get this. I'm very angry today.

246
00:47:26,019 --> 00:47:39,909
I'm very upset today for some reason. Why am I so angry? I'm so annoyed. I don't know why. Why?

247
00:47:39,909 --> 00:47:44,889
There's no reason for me to be annoyed. Fuck this controller. Fuck this system. Fuck this whole

248
00:47:44,889 --> 00:48:15,289
console. I'm just kidding. Geez. Is he stuck? Somebody said,

249
00:48:16,179 --> 00:48:27,050
Frankie Wanky. I have nothing to be upset about. Shit's going real well. I don't know. Maybe it's

250
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:38,019
the whistle that's making me mad. Shut up, whistle. Isn't that making you mad? Oh, I want to go to

251
00:48:38,019 --> 00:48:59,130
the flower. Who do I want to turn? I don't have any reds left, do I? Do I have any red? I might

252
00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:27,900
have exactly five reds. Three. I could do a couple of blues or yellow. I'll do with yellow. Stop.

253
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:42,019
Stop. What? What? What? Laugh out loud. What? Keep the yellows? Do I do it with white then? I know.

254
00:49:42,019 --> 00:49:52,420
White's pretty rare. Oh, is it red? I have red. I wish I could. I want to turn the face cam on

255
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:57,059
right now so you can see what I'm doing right now. I have both hands on the fucking Wiimote and I'm

256
00:49:57,059 --> 00:50:02,179
leaning my neck down stuffed into my body like perched trying desperately hold it right here.

257
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:21,590
I don't have clothes on so I can't do that. All right, next level. Next layer. Where you going?

258
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:35,500
Get over here. You're playing here. Would I lose anybody back here? Where's the exit?

259
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:45,239
Who shows up naked? I don't have to have any clothes on. If I don't say anything,

260
00:50:45,239 --> 00:50:54,019
you guys wouldn't even know. I'm just a voice in your ear. If I didn't tell you I didn't have

261
00:50:54,019 --> 00:51:09,429
clothes on, some of you could have thought I was in a suit for all you knew. We got electricity.

262
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:18,039
Ooh, what do I do about that? I feel like, I don't know, is blue going to be in short supply?

263
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:37,260
How many blues am I going to have over the course of the game? You don't really need blue? Okay,

264
00:51:37,260 --> 00:52:00,619
thanks for the tip. Appreciate it, guys. A is throw. A is grab. I feel like I'm...

265
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:26,019
Ooh, nectar. All right, break it. Everybody drink? Yes. Okay.

266
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:36,059
Now, let's go... All right, that's a lightning bug. Stay away. Wait, don't... I'm not risking

267
00:52:36,059 --> 00:52:48,389
this. Everybody come over here. I'm going to go around with yellow. I got a white here. I don't

268
00:52:48,389 --> 00:52:53,110
want that white. There we go. All right. Let's make sure this is safe first before we go any further.

269
00:52:53,829 --> 00:53:14,579
How do I bet on this with draft kings? You can't. Kill him. Kill him. He's upside down.

270
00:53:15,219 --> 00:53:38,730
Break his bones. Get away from me. Bugs don't have bones. Wrong. Their entire body is a bone.

271
00:53:40,329 --> 00:54:06,840
Exoskeletons. Kill it. All right. We're clearing. I feel like I'm playing an MMO.

272
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:13,619
We're just clearing trash so then we can actually do the thing we want to do.

273
00:54:18,579 --> 00:54:31,130
Okay. Looks good. Bingo. I didn't say wow. I said AMMO.

274
00:54:45,500 --> 00:55:01,860
AMMO. AMMO. Come on. Get him. Flip him over quickly, please. AMMO. I didn't say MMO. I said

275
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:12,170
Alameo. I thought what you said was very funny. Whatever. He can have it. I don't want it. All

276
00:55:12,170 --> 00:55:21,369
right. That's good. It's safe now. Is it safe? It's safe. There's a big tambourine over here.

277
00:55:21,929 --> 00:55:30,199
Oh, it's not safe yet. This would have killed me later. What the fuck is that?

278
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:39,619
Oh, my God. Run. No. Come back. I got to run away. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good.

279
00:55:39,619 --> 00:55:47,139
I got to come back with Purple. Oh, my God. He's flying. He sees everybody.

280
00:55:49,289 --> 00:55:52,570
Okay. We're good. We're good. We're good. I got to throw Purples at him to take him down.

281
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:07,019
I'm going to wait until he does the blow. All right. Come with me. Don't get caught in that.

282
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:20,550
Oh, my God. Everybody come back. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry. We're fine.

283
00:56:21,719 --> 00:56:24,519
Run, Purple. What are you doing standing there like an idiot?

284
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:49,159
Kill him. Are those spikes on his back? Am I throwing them into spikes?

285
00:56:50,039 --> 00:57:09,590
Purple. No. What are you doing? He didn't die, right? Oh, thank God. Okay. We're good.

286
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:20,309
Purple. No. I don't even care if he takes them. All right. Here we go. Now I get my double treasure.

287
00:57:22,469 --> 00:57:26,070
This really is an overreaction stream. I know. I don't know what I'm doing that for.

288
00:57:33,769 --> 00:57:42,460
It's not a tambourine. It's not a treasure. Is your sensor bar set to a button? No,

289
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:58,250
it's set to below TV. Please take a break. It's distressing to see you. Hold on.

290
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:05,300
See this is please take a break. It's distressing to see you play when you aren't in a good mindset.

291
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:14,780
And not only does your gameplay suffer, but we do please take a break. I just started like an

292
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:27,219
hour ago. I would have to be next level baby. Or if I needed to take a break within like 20 minutes

293
00:58:27,219 --> 00:58:30,820
of playing the game. Okay. At that point, it's like, it's not take a break. It's don't play the

294
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:45,960
game anymore because you don't like it. Is it necessarily take a break? Starting up a game

295
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:51,019
in 10 minutes being like, this is stupid. You got to take a break, man. Come back later. Yeah. I

296
00:58:51,019 --> 00:59:07,980
think I'll take a break. It's still treasure. Where? Pick it up. Where is it? Pick it up.

297
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:27,909
Where is it? It's in the hole. Can we get in there? Can I like knock into it? Hey, wait, it's this guy.

298
00:59:28,550 --> 01:00:17,539
You have something in there? Okay. And what was in his hole? What's wrong with you? I don't know.

299
01:00:17,539 --> 01:00:23,019
Somebody said to kill them so I can get in. There's something in this hole. It's the wrong

300
01:00:23,019 --> 01:00:52,760
one. Can I knock it? Did he actually steal a treasure and I can't get in there? To kill them

301
01:00:52,760 --> 01:01:16,619
all. Um, to kill all the bugs. Holy shit. Run away. They come out for food. Um, so I have to kill a

302
01:01:16,619 --> 01:01:45,900
bug over here and leave the dead body. Build the other one. Just kill the other bug. Okay. I don't

303
01:01:45,900 --> 01:02:11,289
like killing these guys. They're like kind of cute and funny. I didn't like doing that. I wasn't a

304
01:02:11,289 --> 01:02:31,929
fan of that. I don't want to kill them. They were not even hostile. Baste. Baste. Baste. Baste. Hello,

305
01:02:31,929 --> 01:02:46,900
my name is German985 and what you just did there was totally baste. All right, we got it all?

306
01:02:47,539 --> 01:03:03,269
Podcaster voice? No, it's not a podcaster voice. This is a podcaster voice.

307
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:18,199
I'll show you what a podcaster voice is. I'm going to fuck up all my settings.

308
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:25,690
So let me just hold on. I actually will mess this up and I won't be able to fix it ever again.

309
01:03:25,690 --> 01:03:41,429
Hold on. Ready? Oh shit. What did I do? Hold on. I want to make sure I don't screw this up.

310
01:03:41,429 --> 01:03:46,460
Okay. Here's your podcaster voice. I think I have to take a screenshot of this

311
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:58,519
because I'll fuck. All right. Hold on. Here's your podcaster voice. So today we're going to be

312
01:03:58,519 --> 01:04:04,340
checking out, uh, you know, I saw this new movie. I saw infinity war and I was seriously not a fan

313
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:19,559
of it. I'm not, I'm not sure what they would think of with Thanos. I don't like him as a villain.

314
01:04:19,559 --> 01:04:32,389
I was more inclined to be a happier with, um, you know, Dr. Dreadful, candy cartoon guy from

315
01:04:32,389 --> 01:04:49,300
the eighties, nineties. He would have been so much more fun. Okay. Are we good? I think I'm,

316
01:04:49,300 --> 01:05:00,760
am I back to normal? I hope, I hope I'm back to normal. More compressor. Hold on. I need to print

317
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:07,420
screen. I fucked it all up. Remember when I had a compressor like that on and everybody freaked out.

318
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:12,300
Everybody was so pissed off. They were like, Mike sucks. Fix your mic. What the fuck? This

319
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:20,539
sounds terrible. I'm like, I was so mad now that this is correct. This is the way it was.

320
01:05:20,539 --> 01:05:28,550
Yeah, we're good. It wasn't that bad. I know it wasn't that bad, but if there's even a slight

321
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:42,579
change in audio, people think that I'm streaming from inside of a bathtub. All right. Is this also

322
01:05:42,579 --> 01:05:54,469
electricity? No, there's a big bunker burger over here. Is that electric? Uh, all right. I gotta get

323
01:05:54,469 --> 01:06:11,269
guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys. No, he ate one. Hurry, hurry. Oh, he's eating everybody.

324
01:06:15,349 --> 01:06:40,920
Shit. He got me into a corner. Uh, has Pikmin die? That's part of the game. Hundreds of Pikmin

325
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:45,960
are going to die over the course of a playthrough of this game. Like they're just dead. They're

326
01:06:45,960 --> 01:07:15,699
going to die. Hundreds of them. Ooh, ice cream. Squish him. I can't go over there.

327
01:07:30,199 --> 01:07:37,320
All right. This is probably going to be a buried treasure. Anything else that I've,

328
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:39,480
because I don't want to throw them over there and have all of a sudden like a

329
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:47,369
bunker burger jump over here and try to kill me. Okay. There's a coffee mug. It looks to be safe.

330
01:07:47,369 --> 01:07:54,389
I think. All right. Just making sure there's nothing else that's going to kill me. All right.

331
01:07:54,389 --> 01:08:28,779
Let's go. Uh, yellow going up there. If I said when I was a kid, I didn't finish the first

332
01:08:28,779 --> 01:08:36,460
level in Pikmin because I didn't want any of them to die. That's so, that's so cute. That's like

333
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:41,689
absolutely adorable. What you just said. That's so cute. Like my God, you just like made my heart

334
01:08:41,689 --> 01:08:47,750
turn to like, you just melted it. That's so cute. That's the cutest thing I've ever heard.

335
01:08:48,710 --> 01:09:07,800
Where are they going? Why are they running over here? Remember he was 30 when he played.

336
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:11,800
So he's not, they're not going to try it. Is he going to try to steal it?

337
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:36,710
Kill him. Don't let him get it. So I have a question about the GameCube controls. How do you

338
01:09:36,710 --> 01:09:55,510
throw Pikmin with the GameCube controller? It's just the C stick. All right. Let's pick up some

339
01:09:55,510 --> 01:10:08,180
stuff. Go up here. Don't get stuck, man. You're going to get stuck. Come on. Is that it for the

340
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:20,939
treasure? That is. All right. Cool. Isn't great, but better than motion controls when you get used

341
01:10:20,939 --> 01:10:26,630
to it. The motion controls are fine. I mean, I'm, I know I was like talking a bunch of shit and I

342
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:32,680
was, you know, making a bunch of jokes. Uh, motion controls are fine. It's, um, to be completely

343
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:37,880
honest with you, it's just like having to hold the thing out, like a remote control for a long

344
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:45,859
period. You know what they didn't make, which they should have made? They should have made a Wii arm

345
01:10:45,859 --> 01:10:51,380
brace or as a device that you attach to the Wii mode and to your wrist and then anchored it to

346
01:10:51,380 --> 01:11:07,930
something. Like a cushion, like an, well, Wii arm anchor cushion. Where are the other two? Uh,

347
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:20,789
there's one up here. There's the other guy back there. Bionic boomer. No, look, it doesn't, I,

348
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:28,600
the strongest man in the world could sit here with a Wiimote holding it up and his forearm would

349
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:32,760
start to get tired and it wouldn't matter. You guys would still make fun of that guy.

350
01:11:32,760 --> 01:12:08,409
Where's this other one? Didn't I get him? There we go. Arty, the strongest man in the world. Yeah.

351
01:12:08,409 --> 01:12:17,460
Arty, strongest man in the world. That's the best character that was on that show.

352
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:25,020
That might be the best character from any Nickelodeon show. I remember when Arty, uh,

353
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:32,069
at, for an entire episode was trying to lift up like Pete and Pete's house and he did it.

354
01:12:32,069 --> 01:12:45,369
He lifted it like a 10th of an inch or something, right? Yeah. The entire episode he's sitting there

355
01:12:45,369 --> 01:12:52,600
like, I will do it. I will lift up your house. And he's sitting there holding like the side of

356
01:12:53,560 --> 01:13:12,199
the vinyl siding in their house. Like the whole episode. Kill. Back up. Follow me. Follow me.

357
01:13:12,199 --> 01:13:45,060
Follow me. Follow me. All right. Back up. Back up. Back up. Back up. Oh, he's going to kill them.

358
01:13:45,699 --> 01:13:59,659
That's close. Take his body. All right. We got these guys to deal with too. I need one good shot.

359
01:14:00,460 --> 01:14:17,640
My arm. I got it. I did it. I did it. I did it. I did it. I did it. Throw the purples. That's

360
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:38,619
what I'm doing. Oh man. What I wouldn't give for a C-stick right now. You need to pay attention.

361
01:14:38,619 --> 01:14:59,670
Don't just look at the chat. Excuse me. Don't. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. All right. We're good. Let's do

362
01:14:59,670 --> 01:15:18,739
treasure hunting. Should I get Thai or pizza? I get Thai. Get Thai food. Get Thai pizza. You could

363
01:15:18,739 --> 01:15:33,210
do that. A good pad Thai is, it's, you can't be beat. Pizza's pizza. Yeah. Pizza's pizza. You can

364
01:15:33,930 --> 01:15:46,279
have pizza, but like pizza's pizza. I want some of you guys to get over here. In fact, all of you

365
01:15:46,279 --> 01:16:06,460
get over there because I want whoever has not drank to drink. Oh, I could have just whatever.

366
01:16:06,460 --> 01:16:19,689
All right. What's next? Treasure got. Treasure get. All you eat is heal. I don't. No, I don't.

367
01:16:20,329 --> 01:16:34,840
Oh, fuck. This level is kind of hard. Oh, that's a good thing to do. He's always aiming over here.

368
01:16:35,399 --> 01:16:48,060
I'm going to do that. Stop shooting over here. Oh, I fucking. Okay. I got to split up. I hope

369
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:55,420
it doesn't aim over here. I need just, just a couple of purples. Come with me. This purple's

370
01:16:55,420 --> 01:17:10,579
very slow. Oh shit. Come on. Back, back, back, back, back, back, back. Come on. Hurry, hurry.

371
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:27,560
Oh my God. There's so many of these guys. Oh shit. Are we good? Come on. Keep going. Yes. Good job.

372
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:51,979
You did it. They will shoot only at me. Oh, okay. Now we have to deal with these guys.

373
01:17:52,619 --> 01:18:04,520
I think I'm safe if I just stay right here. Yeah. I'm safe if I stay here.

374
01:18:05,319 --> 01:18:12,619
That motherfucker just rolled it over here. I back up, back up, back up, back up, back up.

375
01:18:12,619 --> 01:18:33,189
Everybody back up. Oh my God. Please. Wait. Dude, I didn't think it was going to roll that far.

376
01:18:33,189 --> 01:18:40,310
I thought it was an explosion. Oh my God. I have to reset the level. I thought it was,

377
01:18:40,310 --> 01:18:48,060
I didn't think it kept rolling that far. It rolled all the way down here. I lined him up.

378
01:18:49,670 --> 01:18:55,880
I was trying to get away. The yellow's away. I thought it was, of course it hits this fucking edge.

379
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:04,779
Oh God damn it, man. What a pain in the ass. I could have just ran. He just killed another one.

380
01:19:04,779 --> 01:19:22,539
I have to reset. I'm resetting. I'm not. No, that was in half of every Pikmin I own. Wait,

381
01:19:22,539 --> 01:19:30,170
what do you mean? What do you mean? No, no, no, no, no, no. I mean reset the whole console.

382
01:19:30,170 --> 01:19:39,239
That's not reset. Just turn the console off. Wait, what are you talking about? Just turn it off.

383
01:19:39,239 --> 01:19:43,319
Just turn the console, just reset, turn off the console. So you're telling me if I turn off the

384
01:19:43,319 --> 01:19:53,000
console right now, I'll come back and be okay. Consequences. No, not when I lose half of every

385
01:19:53,000 --> 01:20:08,039
Pikmin I own. Okay. I'm turning off the game console. Here we go. I feel like this is bait.

386
01:20:08,039 --> 01:20:29,130
This is bait. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. It's bait. Okay. Shit. Move out of the way.

387
01:20:29,689 --> 01:20:38,220
He just crushed somebody. This fucking wee man. I have a drink in the way. Oh my god. I hate this

388
01:20:38,220 --> 01:21:04,810
fucking console. It's not bait. It's not bait. Actually not bait. Okay. I'm doing it. I did it.

389
01:21:04,810 --> 01:21:10,170
I just turned it off. I turned the console off. I hope, I bet, I better not be bait. I'd be really

390
01:21:10,170 --> 01:21:34,539
mad if it is. Look at Samara for a sec. You want to know something funny about the Wii U? The Wii U,

391
01:21:34,539 --> 01:21:42,069
I think, has a slower startup time to get from go to game, like go into game, turn on console,

392
01:21:42,069 --> 01:21:47,029
then like an old hard drive from like 1998 to turn on Windows fucking 95 did. Like it's a longer

393
01:21:47,029 --> 01:22:00,260
boot up time. It's a longer time to get into a game. Enter the password for your Nintendo network

394
01:22:00,260 --> 01:22:06,260
ID. Oh my fucking god. Why do they even still have a network ID for Nintendo Wii U? I'm probably one

395
01:22:06,260 --> 01:22:24,470
of eight people that are on the fucking network right now. All right. I'm coming back. TV only,

396
01:22:24,470 --> 01:22:33,050
please. Okay. Here we go. Crying and screaming and farting. Beats to study.

397
01:22:33,050 --> 01:22:55,939
Wii U. Put your strap on. Where's the brace? I want like a foam brace that I can stuck on here.

398
01:22:55,939 --> 01:23:01,529
Like a, what's the thing that you, like a sniper rifle. If you're proning with a sniper rifle

399
01:23:01,529 --> 01:23:04,170
and you put out that thing on the front, what's that thing called?

400
01:23:05,050 --> 01:23:12,789
I want one of those for the Wii. A bipod. That's right. Exactly. That's what I want for the Wii.

401
01:23:13,510 --> 01:23:24,420
Holy shit, it worked. It was, I thought it was bait the whole time too. Holy shit. Nice.

402
01:23:29,180 --> 01:23:42,229
I honestly thought it was bait. Let me get comfortable again. There we go. All right.

403
01:23:42,229 --> 01:23:55,239
I did blue. Does anybody else have this problem too? This might just be a me problem,

404
01:23:55,239 --> 01:24:00,779
but like holding up the Wiimote and pressing A with my thumb like is after a while starts

405
01:24:00,779 --> 01:24:07,909
to become like hard to do and like tiring. Did everybody else have that problem too?

406
01:24:08,550 --> 01:24:16,949
I feel like the A button should have been more to the left or something. I don't know.

407
01:24:16,949 --> 01:24:23,989
Let me just find every way I can complain about like a beloved console that everybody loved.

408
01:24:23,989 --> 01:24:43,659
Except for me, apparently. Watch it. All right. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Move, move, move.

409
01:24:44,380 --> 01:24:56,899
These guys suck. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Did we lose one? Okay. I lost one.

410
01:25:01,850 --> 01:25:05,689
Stop throwing them over there. Why is he throwing them that way? That's so unfair.

411
01:25:20,279 --> 01:25:39,640
Use my power up. Well, I have to fight like three of these guys. Kill that. Kill this guy. Shoot him.

412
01:25:40,439 --> 01:25:50,420
Shoot this guy. Shoot this Bunger Burger guy. Shoot this. He's going to eat somebody.

413
01:25:51,850 --> 01:26:02,149
Thank you. My God. Overwhelm him. Overwhelm him. He won't get to fire another shot.

414
01:26:02,949 --> 01:26:26,729
Holy fuck. That was horrible. This place sucks. Reset. You lost four or three. No. Hold A. Press

415
01:26:26,729 --> 01:26:53,140
B. Aim with remote control. High heat sensor bar. Oh, you motherfucker. This console. Oh, my God.

416
01:26:54,180 --> 01:27:13,859
Let me shake my hand a little. They never intended anyone to play this console for more than fucking

417
01:27:13,859 --> 01:27:33,220
20 minutes. They really didn't. I know they didn't. They even have a thing telling you to stand up and

418
01:27:33,220 --> 01:27:43,000
take breaks every fucking 10 minutes. Like, what the hell? Remember how many times that they showed

419
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:47,800
you that screen? They were so hell bent on making sure you didn't play for more than 20 minutes in a

420
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:54,100
row. Remember, get up and stretch and don't knock over the fucking vase that's next to you. That's

421
01:27:54,100 --> 01:28:07,960
right next to your couch for some reason. All right. I split this up. Scratch that. Drink that.

422
01:28:11,289 --> 01:28:19,159
And then VR happened. Yeah, that's true. Watch out. There's a vase next to your dining table or

423
01:28:19,159 --> 01:28:25,239
whatever or next to your couch actually turned into people putting holes in their drywall by

424
01:28:25,239 --> 01:28:45,159
punching with VR. Now, a VR Pikmin that I can get into. I was going to say that killed me. I was

425
01:28:45,159 --> 01:28:55,909
fucking turned off the stream. Shit. Hold on. How am I supposed to do this? All right. Everybody

426
01:28:55,909 --> 01:29:02,779
back up. I'm going in here with like, okay, here's the plan. I'm going in here with just

427
01:29:02,779 --> 01:29:17,640
purples and we'll go. I'm going to split this up small. Is there even treasure over here?

428
01:29:18,710 --> 01:29:27,350
There is. Okay. This is this. Wait, I have an idea. Move. I went over him. Oh my fucking God.

429
01:29:28,739 --> 01:29:44,619
What? This treasure. If I, I have an idea. If I stand in the way, just if I put the captains

430
01:29:44,619 --> 01:29:56,819
in the way and make them get hit by the balls, they can get the treasure, right? I'll just die.

431
01:30:20,180 --> 01:30:43,029
Watch out. Watch out. What's he shooting? Back up. Turn him this way. What are you shooting at? Oh,

432
01:30:43,029 --> 01:31:07,159
fuck. Oh, fuck. He's almost dead. Just relax. What are you shooting? That way? All right. Kill him.

433
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:12,180
Good. Thank God. All right. There's two more. You don't have to recall them when it

434
01:31:12,180 --> 01:31:15,460
tosses them. They run back towards you and the bullets just roll over them off the ramp.

435
01:31:16,260 --> 01:31:19,220
I'm scared. That's scaring me shitless though. I don't know if I can handle that.

436
01:31:19,939 --> 01:31:24,470
All right. There's nothing there. There's one here though. This guy's going to die over here.

437
01:31:25,430 --> 01:31:45,800
Oh, no. I left one. I left one accidentally. Kill that guy. Yes. Shoot him. Shoot this guy.

438
01:31:50,470 --> 01:32:01,380
You little asshole. Come here. Don't carry him. Run. What are you doing? What are you doing?

439
01:32:01,380 --> 01:33:10,619
Why would you try to pick him up? Run away. All right. Collect. Collect the bounty.

440
01:33:10,619 --> 01:33:28,760
Web, web dev here. What? What is web dev? What a, we you dev here. We, we, we, we you dev here.

441
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:32,439
Look, I understand my consoles and their motion controls did not revolutionize the gaming industry

442
01:33:32,439 --> 01:33:36,680
the way we intended them to. But to sit here and watch you shamelessly bash my life's work,

443
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:40,539
who the fuck do you think you are? You know how many years I slaved away Nintendo to bring you

444
01:33:40,539 --> 01:33:44,300
gaming experiences like this only if you stabbed me in the back by calling them garbage. You should

445
01:33:44,300 --> 01:33:52,840
be ashamed. I never said that. I never said that. When did I, when did I say this was garbage? I

446
01:33:52,840 --> 01:34:02,170
didn't say that. I said I want a bipod. And if, if you had a bipod that was for sale, I would have

447
01:34:02,250 --> 01:34:19,899
had much better experience. Yes, I wanted it. I want a tactical Wii mode so I can just plant,

448
01:34:19,899 --> 01:34:28,220
plant it on my arm, the chair of my arm, the arm of my chair and just lock it in there and rest

449
01:34:28,220 --> 01:34:31,420
and have a little bit of, have like a gyro there so I can move the wrist around.

450
01:34:35,079 --> 01:34:44,149
I did not say garbage. I did not. I did not say that. I know I didn't. I did not say garbage.

451
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:57,060
Let me tell you exactly what I said. I said in very direct quotes, fuck this console.

452
01:34:57,060 --> 01:35:01,590
I think that's what it was. I think it was something like that, right? Now that I didn't

453
01:35:01,590 --> 01:35:08,279
say this console was garbage. I just said, fuck this console and fuck this controller, right?

454
01:35:09,079 --> 01:35:13,720
But that doesn't mean I don't like the game. I'm not having fun with the system.

455
01:35:14,680 --> 01:35:33,750
That's worse. No, it's not. That quote was very, oh, fuck. Somebody said,

456
01:35:36,710 --> 01:35:52,390
in direct quotes, I think. I know. Whatever. No, the Wii U. Alright, I can tell you right now.

457
01:35:52,390 --> 01:36:05,260
I don't give a shit about the Wii U. The Wii U was fantastic. It was very good back in like 2007.

458
01:36:11,510 --> 01:36:15,430
The Wii U is what they wanted the Switch so badly to be, but I guess they weren't ready to make it

459
01:36:15,430 --> 01:36:25,079
yet. They took the Wii U idea and just how truly awful it was, and they made it the system they

460
01:36:25,079 --> 01:36:40,010
actually wanted to make with the Switch, and it's way better. So look, I have to give Nintendo some

461
01:36:40,010 --> 01:36:48,539
credit here. With the Wii U being as messy and as fucked up and weird, and I hate to say the word

462
01:36:48,539 --> 01:36:55,289
bad as it was, if we didn't get the Wii U, we may not have gotten the Switch. And think of how good

463
01:36:55,289 --> 01:36:59,210
the Switch is. Think about awesome. Think about how much you use the Switch. Think about awesome

464
01:36:59,210 --> 01:37:05,109
that console really is. We wouldn't have gotten there without the stepping stone that was the Wii

465
01:37:05,109 --> 01:37:27,380
U. Never bought a Switch. I think it's great. Switch is awesome. It's everything I've ever wanted.

466
01:37:27,380 --> 01:37:31,750
Remember when the PSP came out and it was, oh my God, you're going to get PlayStation quality

467
01:37:31,750 --> 01:37:39,180
graphics on the go. It was like, all right. It's okay. It was cool. I needed to go to the bathroom

468
01:37:39,180 --> 01:37:46,090
console. I used to bring my entire computer in to the bathroom, and I get the Switch now. The Switch

469
01:37:46,090 --> 01:37:53,340
is a full actual 3D graphics of the same caliber. And he's telling me I can die. That's my bathroom.

470
01:37:53,340 --> 01:38:10,140
I can go to the bathroom with it. Best thing I've ever bought in my life. What's this ham

471
01:38:10,140 --> 01:38:20,779
doing over here? Why is it like a piece of pork belly? This guy's freaking me out. What's he doing?

472
01:38:20,779 --> 01:38:23,420
What are you doing? What are you doing? Get away from everybody. What are you doing? What's he

473
01:38:23,420 --> 01:38:45,380
doing over here? This guy, he's freaking me out. I don't like this floor. Somebody died? This is a

474
01:38:45,380 --> 01:38:57,659
very dangerous floor. Don't let him steal that. Whatever. There's a lot going on on this floor.

475
01:38:57,659 --> 01:39:02,779
He's stealing a plate. Give me that. That's not for you. That's not for you. Get that from him.

476
01:39:02,779 --> 01:39:09,300
That's not for you. That's not yours. That's not yours. Give it back. Don't let him take that.

477
01:39:11,350 --> 01:39:19,130
Put that down. Put it down. Put that shit down. Get over here. I want that plate.

478
01:39:19,930 --> 01:39:35,939
Oh, it's a piece of bologna. Meat of champions. It is. That killed him? Oh, he like touched the

479
01:39:35,939 --> 01:39:46,539
beam. It fucking insta-killed him. Were you just going to take your friend? All right, you have to

480
01:39:46,539 --> 01:39:53,659
die. I'm not going to deal with that this whole room. No way. It would be nice if I could fucking

481
01:39:53,659 --> 01:40:18,890
land anybody on you. And the big one is freaking me out though. Oh my god. Damn it, man. I have

482
01:40:19,210 --> 01:40:26,789
bracing every bone in my body to do this right now. Holding it right here, I'm using every bone in

483
01:40:26,789 --> 01:40:47,130
my body. I was just holding it into my chest to make sure it wasn't moving that much. All right,

484
01:40:47,130 --> 01:41:03,609
everybody get over here. Bro, what the fuck? What? Okay. Where's my other dudes? We're missing

485
01:41:03,609 --> 01:41:12,300
somebody. Okay, here we go. All right, there's an egg over here. Let's get that egg. Get that over

486
01:41:12,300 --> 01:41:15,899
here quickly before this guy takes it. I kind of like this level. It's like a breakfast level.

487
01:41:15,899 --> 01:41:25,460
Where you going? Where they going? Down? Not where you going? And down this way. Thank you.

488
01:41:44,260 --> 01:41:48,520
That looks like a pretty good egg. All right, in the chat, I want to know

489
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:52,039
over easy, over medium, or over hard. If you say anything besides over medium,

490
01:41:52,600 --> 01:42:04,899
you are banned from this channel. Well, looks like we're dropping a lot of people today.

491
01:42:05,619 --> 01:42:13,510
I love over over medium is perfect. Because it gives you the sort of gel,

492
01:42:13,510 --> 01:42:25,159
almost gelatin like substance of the kill this guy. He's gonna steal something event. No,

493
01:42:25,159 --> 01:42:33,000
I've just just get rid of the good I was doing before. Need yellow. They're not hostile. So

494
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:51,380
it's fine. Kill always over medium other 10 times actually made right. Actually over medium

495
01:42:51,380 --> 01:42:57,510
is the hardest one to do. Because that's why it's the best one. Over medium is the most difficult

496
01:42:57,510 --> 01:43:14,729
egg to cook. People don't get it right. What about boiled eggs? Yep. I love hard boiled eggs. But

497
01:43:14,729 --> 01:43:21,260
here's the thing about hard boiled for me. I don't want soft boiled egg. I want a over medium egg,

498
01:43:21,260 --> 01:43:25,180
but I don't want a soft boiled egg. And you probably be confused saying, Jeremy, isn't a

499
01:43:25,180 --> 01:43:30,220
soft boiled egg exactly what you want? That is exactly an over medium style. And I'll say yes,

500
01:43:30,220 --> 01:43:36,220
it is. But when it's a hard boiled egg, I want it to be solid. I don't want it to be drippy or

501
01:43:36,220 --> 01:43:49,960
gooey. I want it to be solid. Read chat. What? He's stealing the treasure. Who is? I'm trying to

502
01:43:49,960 --> 01:44:15,560
get rid of the electricity. I'll get it back. Somebody die. I can still get that treasure. I

503
01:44:15,560 --> 01:44:27,079
just have to kill him. Yeah, but over medium is my favorite type of like that style cooked on a

504
01:44:27,079 --> 01:44:34,810
skillet. Hard boiled I like it to be fully cooked all the way. I really am not a big fan of that.

505
01:44:34,810 --> 01:44:41,130
So we can go scrambled eggs here. I don't I'm sorry. I don't like the scrambled egg. That's

506
01:44:41,689 --> 01:44:45,289
you put it in the pan for five seconds and you stir it around and then it's done.

507
01:44:45,289 --> 01:44:49,449
No, no, no, no, no. That's like porridge. It's sludge. I like my scrambled eggs to be

508
01:44:50,250 --> 01:44:54,090
solid. I don't like the sludge porridge shit. I don't I really don't.

509
01:44:55,619 --> 01:45:10,359
Okay, let's kill this guy. It's got to be purple. I get it. I don't think he can even

510
01:45:10,359 --> 01:45:32,329
can even hurt anybody can even attack. I don't this is gonna take a while. He's not like the

511
01:45:32,329 --> 01:45:36,010
caterpillar for Mario, right? Like, eventually, he's not going to freak out. So sprinting around

512
01:45:36,010 --> 01:45:51,750
and killing everybody. Or if I get him down to red health and he starts to sprint around,

513
01:45:51,750 --> 01:46:20,300
I'm gonna freak out. All right, split up any purple. Thank you. Where's he going?

514
01:46:20,300 --> 01:46:39,930
He's walking like Squidward. What's that mean? Walking like Squidward. Dead. And he dropped a

515
01:46:39,930 --> 01:46:51,399
can of milk and a donut. Oh shit, he had a lot of stuff. Processing how bizarre an item appears to

516
01:46:51,399 --> 01:46:57,739
have fallen out of the freakish creature. Must have been a greedy beast to swallow something like this.

517
01:46:58,380 --> 01:47:03,430
Probably. We have a lot of yeah, this is why I didn't want to stay.

518
01:47:04,310 --> 01:47:14,060
Yeah, I'm good. Oh, right. Shit. We got warrior where smooth moves on the Wii.

519
01:47:15,340 --> 01:47:19,100
It's like one of the best consoles. Never mind. I'm sorry. I put my drink down in front of the Wii

520
01:47:19,100 --> 01:47:38,869
sense of our fuck this stupid shitty console. The donut. Get a candle. No, I will burn my whole

521
01:47:38,869 --> 01:47:48,229
I'll burn my house of light. I'll burn my entire room down. I don't like candles. I love candles.

522
01:47:48,869 --> 01:47:52,390
But I I'm always afraid of having a candle in multiple rooms.

523
01:47:53,779 --> 01:47:58,789
Maybe some of you can level with me here. Candles great. But I know people that put candles in a

524
01:47:58,789 --> 01:48:02,630
bunch of rooms. You know, there's a candle in the bedroom. There's a candle in the living room.

525
01:48:02,630 --> 01:48:06,789
There's a candle lit in the kitchen. I want to be able to have an eyesight of that candle

526
01:48:06,789 --> 01:48:11,239
from anywhere that I'm going to be standing for the next hour. I don't want to know candle in

527
01:48:11,239 --> 01:48:23,140
a room I'm not going to be using. Absolutely not. If I cannot see that candle, it better be out.

528
01:48:26,060 --> 01:48:28,939
It is far more advanced than the material I was researching. How frustrating.

529
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:34,119
Space suit made from this wonder ally could insulate the wearer from electric shocks. Oh,

530
01:48:34,119 --> 01:48:39,180
cool. I could walk through electricity. The hard word to say when you're just not prepared for it.

531
01:48:39,899 --> 01:48:50,149
This new material has allowed me to complete my anti-electrifier. It's my own invention with

532
01:48:50,149 --> 01:48:58,970
only the smallest iota of outside inspiration. Do you burn incense with your healing bracelets?

533
01:49:00,279 --> 01:49:06,649
Actually, I don't. I'm a bit I like essential oils, though, not because I think they give me

534
01:49:06,649 --> 01:49:12,859
powers, but I just like the way tea tree oil smells. I just like the way tea tree smells.

535
01:49:12,859 --> 01:49:19,350
I like the way eucalyptus smells. It doesn't give me powers. I just like the way it smells.

536
01:49:19,350 --> 01:49:28,920
Cultist. No, I'm well aware that it doesn't do anything for me. Well, that's not true.

537
01:49:30,090 --> 01:49:35,829
Tea tree is actually really good for your hair. I mean, that's a good thing. It's good for your

538
01:49:35,829 --> 01:49:46,470
hair. It can relax you a little bit. It doesn't do anything. It doesn't give you powers. I mean,

539
01:49:46,470 --> 01:49:51,430
that's how it starts. Okay, well, that's how it starts. Like 15 years ago, I should have gone

540
01:49:51,430 --> 01:49:57,529
down like the rabbit hole. I didn't. I thought tea tree smelled good and was cool when I was like

541
01:49:57,529 --> 01:50:17,859
20. I didn't progress. Sweet dreamer. Did everybody drink? You look like a greasy today.

542
01:50:21,829 --> 01:50:30,310
Probably. That was pretty cool. I like the breakfast place. I didn't like the boulder bugs.

543
01:50:30,310 --> 01:50:51,430
That's $1,300. You're an essential oils pyramid scheme. No, I bought a bottle of tea tree oil.

544
01:50:53,989 --> 01:51:02,090
I want to say maybe seven or eight years ago that I still have it. It's still fine.

545
01:51:02,970 --> 01:51:15,079
I smell it sometimes. Day's almost over. We're good. Nobody's left out. Pretty good. That's

546
01:51:15,079 --> 01:51:30,579
a pretty good day. That's a pretty good day. $1,200. I signed up for this program where I get a bottle

547
01:51:30,579 --> 01:51:36,250
of tea tree. I get 10 essential oil bottles delivered to my door every month. What you guys

548
01:51:36,250 --> 01:51:41,619
don't understand is you could do this too. You could get it delivered to your door every month

549
01:51:41,619 --> 01:51:45,859
and then you could bring 10 people in to deliver them to 10 people's houses and then those 10

550
01:51:45,859 --> 01:51:55,640
people could have 10 other people and 100 people would be underneath you. Years ago

551
01:51:57,380 --> 01:52:04,119
me and Burger Boy would spend a lot of time together. We were going to try to get him to

552
01:52:04,119 --> 01:52:09,220
he and he wanted to do it too. We weren't trying to convince him or anything. We wanted to get him

553
01:52:09,220 --> 01:52:14,100
to do one of those MLM things and see how much money he could make going around trying to sell

554
01:52:14,100 --> 01:52:21,220
people's stuff. We're like, it would be funny if you just tried and he's like,

555
01:52:22,020 --> 01:52:27,979
actually, yeah, maybe that would be funny. Burger Boy shows up and is like, let me ask you a question.

556
01:52:29,319 --> 01:52:56,329
How's your skin care? Burger Boy ends up making $50,000 a month doing it. Wicked funny. No. A wicked

557
01:52:56,329 --> 01:53:07,930
funny pyramid scheme. He didn't do it. We just like joked about it. Omar, you're my hero. You've

558
01:53:07,930 --> 01:53:12,170
erased half of our debt. Still, things have become a bit dangerous. So I'm going into hiding. Focus

559
01:53:12,170 --> 01:53:20,890
on work and don't slack off. What the hell are you doing? What is this? Why is the chat all hacked?

560
01:53:20,890 --> 01:53:29,529
Why is the chat hacked? How are you doing that? Don't do that. Why is it hacked? Oh, what the

561
01:53:29,529 --> 01:53:51,109
fuck is going on here? I don't even know what's going on over there. But no, we were just talking

562
01:53:51,109 --> 01:53:56,869
about Burger Boy. Why don't you join that thing? And if you're like, I'm not fucking doing that

563
01:53:56,869 --> 01:54:07,399
stupid fucking scam. Take the red pill, Jerma. I don't even know what the hell is going on.

564
01:54:07,960 --> 01:54:27,100
Is this some new program? Put it in sub only. Put it in sub only quick. Don't do it. Take the blue

565
01:54:27,100 --> 01:54:42,789
pill and have a nice steak. I'm going back here. Look at all this other stuff I didn't do here.

566
01:54:44,619 --> 01:54:58,170
I have a good steak. He doesn't know what Unicode is. I don't know. I don't know.

567
01:54:58,970 --> 01:55:22,489
Okay, what do we got? We got... Let me take a quick look. What is here? We did this. Okay,

568
01:55:22,489 --> 01:55:26,890
I want more blue. What about over here? Up this way? Will we investigate what's this way?

569
01:55:27,529 --> 01:55:30,649
If there's an electric fence over here, then... Fuck yeah.

570
01:55:35,590 --> 01:55:47,500
Hmm. What's down there? Secret? Secret treasure? All right. There's nothing over here, Louis. I

571
01:55:47,500 --> 01:55:51,859
don't care. You can stay there for the rest of the level. I don't care. There's nothing over there.

572
01:55:52,500 --> 01:56:09,819
Go behind. Ooh, okay. This is nectar. Well, we actually kind of need it. Not yet, though.

573
01:56:09,819 --> 01:56:16,149
So what's the thing I haven't done here? Perfect Jupiter is, yeah, pretty good.

574
01:56:16,869 --> 01:56:32,859
What's up here? Don't fight this guy. Don't even need to. All right. Is it... There's a cave? I

575
01:56:32,859 --> 01:56:38,010
think I've already... Did I complete this cave? I completed this cave. So we gotta go... All right.

576
01:56:38,010 --> 01:56:41,399
I know where to go. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Let's bring

577
01:56:42,039 --> 01:56:47,239
25 blues. Let's pick... Let's spend a day collecting some Pikmin. What do you say?

578
01:56:47,800 --> 01:56:54,010
It's a lot of Jupiters right now. Hey, don't you know now's your op... This is the opportunity.

579
01:56:55,100 --> 01:56:59,260
Now's the opportunity, guys, to put out, like, German TV, an emote that you'll never see.

580
01:56:59,260 --> 01:57:14,659
This is the opportunity to put out as many German TVs as you can put out. Well, hold on. Don't just

581
01:57:14,659 --> 01:57:40,329
start doing that. And we'll do some red. Let's see. 15 red and purple. We got now some white

582
01:57:40,329 --> 01:57:50,630
and then the rest will do blue. No, yellow. 30 yellow. And that leaves us with... Oh, get some

583
01:57:50,630 --> 01:58:04,149
red, too. Why not? First of all, I need blue. Blue, go get this. We need more of you. Put it

584
01:58:04,149 --> 01:58:11,770
in your thing. I need blue. There's a couple more flowers over here. I'm just doing some

585
01:58:11,770 --> 01:58:22,649
Pikmin collection. I'm doing some Pikmin utility here. OK, grab that. That's blue.

586
01:58:26,699 --> 01:58:42,149
Grab this one, too. Blue. Thank you. We're on 10-year slow mode. Go ahead and get it.

587
01:58:43,029 --> 01:58:53,539
Go on. Bring it to blue. Did I take a break yet? No, I haven't. We'll probably take a first break

588
01:58:53,539 --> 01:59:06,699
here in a little bit. After this level, I will. You literally won't. Why do you think I'm not

589
01:59:06,699 --> 01:59:22,470
going to take a break? No break. No, don't bring that over to yellow. What are you dumb?

590
01:59:26,869 --> 01:59:41,060
$25,000 slow mode. OK, now we can take the whole crew. I now have 100.

591
01:59:49,050 --> 02:00:00,409
Somebody get that. Whatever. Just get one more. Just put it in blue. 99 out of 100. Where's the

592
02:00:00,409 --> 02:00:22,380
last 100? Where's the last guy? Wait. Nectar. Where is it? This way, right? Yeah. Stop what?

593
02:00:24,149 --> 02:00:32,899
The stream fucking sucks. Get out of here. Give me a break. Get out of here.

594
02:00:36,260 --> 02:00:48,550
Come on, dude. Like, what the fuck? All right, let's go. Get him out of here.

595
02:00:53,369 --> 02:00:59,449
This is worst stream 2021. Get out of here. Truly get out of here. That's bullshit. No, it's not.

596
02:01:08,119 --> 02:01:22,779
OK. Water. Yes. Catboy will be worst stream 2021? No, it will not. What are you smoking?

597
02:01:23,420 --> 02:01:28,390
You have no idea what I'm going to do for the catboy stream. And I'm sorry for all some of you

598
02:01:28,390 --> 02:01:32,630
might be new here, but if you think I'm just going to put on cat ears and like eye makeup,

599
02:01:32,630 --> 02:01:36,630
you are out of your fucking mind. You think that's what I'm going to do for that stream?

600
02:01:37,270 --> 02:01:55,720
I would just hold on a minute. I was going to put cat ears on, put on like a little bit of

601
02:01:56,359 --> 02:02:24,520
eyeliner. You must not have been here for very long. What we do here, get a competing dog boy.

602
02:02:25,479 --> 02:02:38,279
That's fucking funny. I'll tell you, I'll be very, very honest. That's going to be a very

603
02:02:38,279 --> 02:02:49,899
elaborate stream. It's not just going to be me with cat ears. And speaking of big streams,

604
02:02:50,539 --> 02:02:59,689
maybe we'll see you on March 6th for the archaeology stream. Maybe you learn a few things.

605
02:03:05,220 --> 02:03:17,000
OK, so now I've got to put the bridge out or bridge up. Can I do this with just blue? Good

606
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:28,729
kill. Good kill. Kill. Do March 5th. It's my birthday. No, I'm sorry. You just pretend like

607
02:03:28,729 --> 02:03:38,699
it's your birthday on the 6th. All right. There's a scary guy over here. Is he fire? He's not. It's

608
02:03:38,699 --> 02:03:47,579
one of these. Oh my. It's targeting me. It's homing missile. Why is it still spinning? What the fuck is

609
02:03:47,579 --> 02:04:13,270
this doing? Get out of here. Get out of here. Come on. Hurry run past it. I'm not trying to fight.

610
02:04:13,270 --> 02:04:16,390
I'm just trying to put the bridge. I don't want to get in a fight. Leave me alone.

611
02:04:18,180 --> 02:04:34,180
Yeah, I might have to fight this guy. All right. Kill him. We might lose one. It's all right. OK,

612
02:04:34,180 --> 02:04:44,260
we're good. Get away from me. Don't even think about coming over here. Come on, guys. Get it.

613
02:04:47,369 --> 02:04:51,609
Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat.

614
02:04:51,609 --> 02:05:06,149
Oh, that almost. I almost lost it at the end. All right. We've got to come kill these guys. I need

615
02:05:06,149 --> 02:05:14,710
fire. Good job. All right. We are now ready to bring everybody here. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat.

616
02:05:33,020 --> 02:05:59,819
OK, fire. What happened to Louie? Kill. You're immune to fire. Kill it. OK, now we need purple.

617
02:05:59,819 --> 02:06:11,939
The rest can come over here, actually. One hundred. Nobody died. Good. This is where it gets a little

618
02:06:11,939 --> 02:06:44,680
intense. And holy shit, I could have been really bad. Why is it curving? Why are they curving? Why

619
02:06:44,680 --> 02:06:59,479
are they curving? Why is it curving? They're homing. That's unbelievable. I'm trying to get

620
02:06:59,479 --> 02:07:05,739
out of the way. What? When does it hit? Just run. I don't even care. What a stupid enemy.

621
02:07:06,460 --> 02:07:43,420
Is it fire? Oh my God. Get him down. What? It's already midnight? Can I get up there? How do I

622
02:07:43,420 --> 02:08:13,000
get up here? Oh, bridge. Stop bringing that back. All right. I got 88. Let's go. Another cave

623
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:19,909
discovered. Venturing to the farthest reaches has proven rewarding. You may be tired of walking,

624
02:08:19,909 --> 02:08:36,939
but just one last leap remains now to get that treasure. I don't have enough. I don't have any

625
02:08:36,939 --> 02:08:44,409
white. Do I even have any white? All right. We're coming back here and getting that crown tomorrow.

626
02:08:44,409 --> 02:08:57,829
How many white do I have? I'm going to try it. How many white do I have? I only have three

627
02:08:57,829 --> 02:09:11,829
white Pikmin. I think we're safe for non-subs to come back. Bring them back. Let's see if they'll

628
02:09:11,829 --> 02:09:29,800
behave. All right. Where are we? There's purple. Snow. Who do I want to replace for purple?

629
02:09:30,680 --> 02:09:38,500
Everybody line up. What have we got? I have a lot of blue. I think I'm going to do blue.

630
02:09:40,090 --> 02:09:54,520
This might be a mistake. This cave's scary. This cave sucks. This cave's hard. Well,

631
02:09:55,319 --> 02:10:06,710
let's see if I get wiped. Here comes a difficulty chat. Difficulty spike. Damn it. Really? Well,

632
02:10:06,710 --> 02:10:30,359
all right. We're just going in. What is that thing? Kill it. Crush it. No, no, no, no, no,

633
02:10:30,359 --> 02:10:33,399
no, no, no, no. Run, run, run, run, run, run. I didn't know what that was. I didn't know what

634
02:10:33,399 --> 02:10:56,010
that was. I didn't know what that was. I thought it was a snowball. All right. Whatever.

635
02:10:56,810 --> 02:10:59,770
I didn't know what that thing was. I thought it was a snowball.

636
02:11:01,899 --> 02:11:07,699
They got me. They baited me. This game is so bad. I can't believe anyone would even

637
02:11:07,699 --> 02:11:11,960
play this for more than a minute. This is a beloved Nintendo franchise. This is the worst

638
02:11:11,960 --> 02:11:19,640
game I've ever played. This is worse than Big Rigs. I'm sorry. That's going to be taken out

639
02:11:19,640 --> 02:11:28,859
of context like everything I fucking say. Watch out. Don't get caught in the cast.

640
02:11:29,659 --> 02:11:37,159
That's just Attack on Titan again. I think that's funny, but I have to stop doing that.

641
02:11:38,779 --> 02:11:41,500
There's going to be a huge Pikmin fan that's going to see that and be like,

642
02:11:41,500 --> 02:11:47,060
why did he hate it so much? Why is he such a dick? I don't understand. Why would he be like that?

643
02:11:47,859 --> 02:12:24,819
OK, I'm back. You ate one. You fucking ate one. Crush him. Overwhelm him. All right. He lost his.

644
02:12:28,600 --> 02:12:45,460
These corridors are so tight. It's the corridors are so small. All right. This buried treasure

645
02:12:45,460 --> 02:13:02,060
here. I hope I have a white Pikmin to dig this. I do. I'll get it. You know,

646
02:13:02,060 --> 02:13:06,539
I wish if when I pressed C to go to Louie, I didn't. I wasn't still attached to everybody.

647
02:13:07,100 --> 02:13:17,210
It's kind of annoying. I just want to be Louie. I don't want to be Louie and bring the whole crew.

648
02:13:18,010 --> 02:13:44,680
All right. Get that diamond. Nice. The third game fixes that. This boss killed my entire

649
02:13:44,680 --> 02:13:58,409
squad. Good luck. Great. That doesn't sound good. Only 70 for a Ruby. There's a noob in the chat.

650
02:13:58,409 --> 02:14:18,920
Oh, please. Noob. This game's not easy. This game's not easy. Don't let anybody tell you that.

651
02:14:18,920 --> 02:14:43,420
It is. It's pretty easy. Is it? This game was made for children. This game was made for children

652
02:14:43,420 --> 02:14:51,060
like 15 years ago. It's different. They made children's games hard 15, 20 years ago.

653
02:14:51,699 --> 02:15:12,859
So if Pikmin were to be made now, there would be a Pikmin generator that I would just go to

654
02:15:12,859 --> 02:15:27,500
the pause menu and just spawn another red Pikmin as many as I wanted. You think Nintendo would not

655
02:15:27,500 --> 02:15:32,619
put that in nowadays? If you lose the same Mario level three or four times, it will beat the game

656
02:15:32,619 --> 02:15:48,869
for you. You don't think there'll be a Pikmin generator in the menu in 2020, 2021? Further into

657
02:15:48,869 --> 02:16:07,939
the depths. Easy. Our game is so easy. I didn't say that. I still have trouble. I would say,

658
02:16:07,939 --> 02:16:15,430
look, I've been Louie, dude, plenty of times in the new games. You want to know why I've never

659
02:16:15,430 --> 02:16:20,390
played Super Mario 3D World, really, or Super Mario New Mario Brothers Wii, whatever? A lot

660
02:16:20,390 --> 02:16:24,250
of people have said, oh, you should play that. Because I know for a fact that I'm going to get

661
02:16:24,250 --> 02:16:30,409
Luigi'd a bunch of times and it's going to be Omega Lels in the chat. Louie-jied. Bad streamer.

662
02:16:30,409 --> 02:16:35,370
Louie-jied again. I know it's going to happen. So that's why I'm just like, I don't want to play

663
02:16:35,370 --> 02:16:39,850
that. I'm scared to play it. I'm scared to get Louie-jied more than the quota that I'm allowed

664
02:16:39,850 --> 02:16:51,530
of, like three. Okay. This level sucks. Okay. What do I do about this? I'm going to wake this

665
02:16:51,530 --> 02:16:58,010
guy up. Can I get them to shoot each other? I'm going to try this. I'm going to do a tactic here.

666
02:17:02,200 --> 02:17:07,659
Everybody stay back here with me and Louie. Don't come in here. No, he's going to shoot

667
02:17:07,659 --> 02:17:13,350
it right down this lane and kill everybody. Oh, my God. He actually did it. No, he didn't. All

668
02:17:13,350 --> 02:17:16,950
right. Just go, go, go, go, go. Run, run. Why are you still with me? I just, I didn't see. Get out

669
02:17:16,950 --> 02:17:47,739
of here. Shoot him. Good. Do it again. Good. It worked. Now shoot each other. Oh, damn it. All

670
02:17:47,739 --> 02:18:10,409
right. Come on. Get him. Get him. Yes. Yes. Wrap it back around. All right. Now kill him. Good.

671
02:18:10,409 --> 02:18:28,409
Now come this way. Let him shoot. Damn it. I got to spin him around. Punch with A. Yeah,

672
02:18:28,409 --> 02:18:45,100
I do like no damage. I need to move this out of the way. Punch him to death. I guess like.

673
02:18:51,979 --> 02:19:00,629
I'm fine. He's going to. Okay. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I ain't going to have this happen.

674
02:19:01,590 --> 02:19:10,059
Fuck. This is a horrible position to be in. All right. Here we go. I'm going to let him

675
02:19:10,059 --> 02:19:51,420
walk away. There we go. Thank you. Now I'll be able to get him. Turn this way. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

676
02:19:52,059 --> 02:20:19,020
Yes. Yes. Yes. Don't let him eat you. Yes. What is that? Is that from something? All right. It's

677
02:20:19,020 --> 02:20:33,159
now safe. It's Captain Falcon. Yeah. Yes. It is. Okay. That's just curious. All right. Get the

678
02:20:33,159 --> 02:21:14,489
spoils of war. Come on. Soundboard. F-Zero GX on stream. I don't understand F-Zero. I just don't.

679
02:21:15,989 --> 02:21:21,989
Everybody talks so highly of F-Zero. F-Zero. Oh my God. F-Zero. Captain Falcon is so cool.

680
02:21:23,270 --> 02:21:32,579
Nobody actually cares about that game. Like why don't they make one? Why does anybody? I feel

681
02:21:32,579 --> 02:21:36,340
like people talk so highly of like Captain Falcon and F-Zero, but I don't think anybody plays it.

682
02:21:37,219 --> 02:21:46,549
And they like won't make a new game or anything. It's not even nostalgia. It's like a new

683
02:21:46,549 --> 02:21:55,239
generation of like kids think he's cool. He is cool. He's really cool. Why don't they just

684
02:21:55,239 --> 02:21:59,500
make another one? Oh, it doesn't need to be a racing game. Make like a Captain Falcon adventure

685
02:21:59,500 --> 02:22:02,700
game where you walk around and punch people and stuff. Like people would eat that up like crazy.

686
02:22:03,340 --> 02:22:29,579
Do I not have enough to get this? Shit. Is it yellow back here? I think there's enough yellow.

687
02:22:29,579 --> 02:22:53,930
Yeah. Oh, there's a ramp here. I literally was blending in with the ground. I couldn't see it.

688
02:22:54,649 --> 02:23:23,639
It's a present too. The football. Oh, the Super Bowl is on. Oh. Oh, I don't know. A Super Bowl.

689
02:23:28,680 --> 02:23:36,870
Welcome to the Super Bowl. It's me, John Madden.

690
02:23:48,709 --> 02:24:08,010
It's like I'm there. Is that all the treasure? Yeah. All right. Who is it going to win? Hey,

691
02:24:08,729 --> 02:24:11,930
no, I won't be. I definitely won't be alive when the Super Bowl is over. I was going to

692
02:24:11,930 --> 02:24:16,180
do a prediction for it, but I'm not going to be live when the Super Bowl is ending.

693
02:24:16,899 --> 02:24:28,920
So it'll be wasted points. Okay. Let's assess what's going on here. There is a white flower.

694
02:24:30,489 --> 02:24:36,920
Good thing there's a white flower. I need to replace. Hmm. I don't know. It seems yellow

695
02:24:36,920 --> 02:24:45,239
probably, right? I don't know. I have an equal amount of pretty much everybody. Don't get it yet.

696
02:24:45,239 --> 02:24:55,940
Do it at the end. Okay. Well, we have fire. Let's get rid of the fire. I'm going to say,

697
02:24:55,940 --> 02:25:02,569
all right, we've got multiple things to deal with here. Louis, Louis, you take fire and you,

698
02:25:03,370 --> 02:25:06,569
you know what? You know what else I don't like about this video game? Walking into

699
02:25:06,569 --> 02:25:14,870
Pikmin collects them. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Okay. And then I'll let.

700
02:25:18,500 --> 02:25:23,379
What are they doing over here? Oh my God. Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run,

701
02:25:23,379 --> 02:25:28,180
run, run. Don't fight. Run. I hope there's nothing in this. I picked the one hallway.

702
02:25:28,180 --> 02:25:44,950
They didn't have anything. Okay. Turn around and get them. Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

703
02:25:45,670 --> 02:25:50,360
Get back here. Quick. They're blocked. Oh my God. You're being blocked.

704
02:25:55,049 --> 02:26:03,420
Fucking land on them. Oh my God. We just saw that. They were dead.

705
02:26:07,299 --> 02:26:20,100
Gee, is there anybody still alive in his ass? Like what the fuck? That was so all right. That

706
02:26:20,100 --> 02:26:30,180
was horrible. Okay. We're good. That was horrible. They just, they were pursuing us. They came for us.

707
02:26:32,059 --> 02:26:40,940
I don't, I hate those ones. They actually actively come get you. 120. That was inside of his

708
02:26:41,579 --> 02:26:52,100
danger chime. Okay. 66 though. Okay. So what was I doing? Right. I was in the middle of trying to

709
02:26:52,100 --> 02:27:00,280
plan my, what I was going to do. So let's blurt it out. I'm going to take electricity with Olimar.

710
02:27:02,870 --> 02:27:12,899
Okay. Electric Olimar. Louie, you, Louie, you need to spread these guys out and get red.

711
02:27:12,899 --> 02:27:23,379
I'm like right next to the microphone. I'm sorry. Okay. Olimar, yellow. All right. It's time.

712
02:27:24,100 --> 02:27:35,299
Fire first. Louie, go. My, my elbow is red. I need one of those bionic arms. Oh shit. Here comes like

713
02:27:35,299 --> 02:28:00,889
another invasion. Get out of here. What happened? A confused Bulborb has fallen in with the Pikmin.

714
02:28:00,889 --> 02:28:05,510
They appear to be, to coexist peacefully. Wait, what? Did I just kill one for no reason?

715
02:28:07,450 --> 02:28:11,610
Strange. This Bulborb has a leaf sprouting from its spine, much like the leaf on a Pikmin's head.

716
02:28:13,940 --> 02:28:24,819
Oh, I would, they wouldn't friendly. Well, oh no, that was a leader. That was a big one.

717
02:28:27,770 --> 02:28:39,500
I love the little Bulborbs. I love them so much. I love them. They're my favorite. They must be

718
02:28:39,500 --> 02:28:46,680
protected at all costs. Okay. Yellow. Let's go up here and just do this. This gas up there.

719
02:28:57,379 --> 02:29:19,500
Tack. Kill everything. Excellent. Excellent. They can't die. Really? All right. And there's the way

720
02:29:19,500 --> 02:29:26,809
to go down lower. Don't want to do that yet. I do appreciate the haunted house exit though. I do.

721
02:29:26,809 --> 02:29:33,209
Just in case you don't want to do it. The guy that's standing at the door and like in the,

722
02:29:33,209 --> 02:29:38,649
in the black jumpsuit that it's like all the screaming, crying kids run out that way before

723
02:29:38,649 --> 02:29:45,579
the really scary stuff. I'm really glad it's there. By the way, just want to let you know,

724
02:29:46,379 --> 02:29:52,940
I have had to use the escape haunted house exit one time in my whole life.

725
02:29:54,309 --> 02:30:01,510
And all I remember was crying buried into my father's chest while he was holding me.

726
02:30:01,510 --> 02:30:09,510
I was like probably six or seven. I was crying and just seeing the guy go right this way,

727
02:30:09,510 --> 02:30:15,750
right this way. And we just went outside into the air. That's all I remember.

728
02:30:16,389 --> 02:30:24,420
I don't remember anything else. Okay. Electricity all gone. It is. All right. We need the gas.

729
02:30:25,059 --> 02:30:52,500
Okay. Everybody stay. I need more white. No. Fuck the Wiimote. Get it.

730
02:30:56,459 --> 02:31:01,750
Put the Bulbman in the white flower. No way. Can I take them out to the surface?

731
02:31:02,309 --> 02:31:09,979
If I can take them to the surface, I'm not going to do that. I can't take them out to the surface.

732
02:31:09,979 --> 02:31:20,870
What? Oh, come on now. Really? That's really unfortunate. That's horrible.

733
02:31:21,590 --> 02:31:28,600
All right. Let's go get everybody. We're ready to move. The fire is up there, but I don't need

734
02:31:28,600 --> 02:31:37,829
unless there's a hidden one somewhere. They're immune to everything. Is there? Let's see.

735
02:31:38,549 --> 02:31:53,420
Just use them while you have them. Okay. Was it a pen? Oh, it's a candle. There actually is.

736
02:31:54,579 --> 02:32:15,829
There is something buried. Okay. We got to get it. Everybody come over here. Okay. So I should

737
02:32:15,829 --> 02:32:26,979
throw the Bulbasaur in there. Use them while I have them. Don't. I'm seeing a lot of conflicting

738
02:32:26,979 --> 02:32:57,030
data here. They're invincible. Don't. Okay. Well, then I'm going to throw blue. Okay. 76. Let's go.

739
02:32:57,670 --> 02:33:29,700
Can they drink the nectar? Oh, wait. We good? Okay. We're good. Take the cupcakes. Those bugs

740
02:33:29,700 --> 02:33:37,030
freak out. Yeah, they do. All right. It's time to go and try to find this one that's buried.

741
02:33:41,670 --> 02:33:48,090
Money, money, money. Butter, butter, butter fills the bowl. We're making us a cake that you've never

742
02:33:48,090 --> 02:33:54,420
seen before. We're making us a cake that you've never seen before. Heat up the oven. Now we're on

743
02:33:54,420 --> 02:34:01,000
a roll. Heat up the oven. Now on a roll. Cheep, cheep, cheep is the name of your soul. Cheep,

744
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:20,540
cheep, cheep. Where's this last one? And it's buried. Where is it buried? It's buried over here.

745
02:34:21,260 --> 02:34:32,520
Thanks for joining me, everybody. Hope you're having a good day. Hope you're having a Sunday.

746
02:34:32,520 --> 02:34:38,940
Super Bowl Sunday. Hope you got yourself a slice of pizza and a big Subway Sub. The big ones. The

747
02:34:38,940 --> 02:34:49,659
comically large ones. Oh, I don't like Subway. Subway's terrible. Whatever. A chain that you like.

748
02:34:50,299 --> 02:35:05,750
Ooh, this would be worth a lot. Get that treasure. Stop saying dumbass things.

749
02:35:07,620 --> 02:35:18,020
Um, I'm pretty much like 90% sure that at least half the time that I open my mouth on this stream

750
02:35:18,020 --> 02:35:23,379
it's to say a dumbass thing. So if you don't like that kind of content, I suggest you go watch the

751
02:35:23,379 --> 02:35:44,920
Super Bowl. That's on right now. Don't you know it's 50% stuff that you say in the shower when

752
02:35:44,920 --> 02:36:05,000
you know no one's listening to you. 25% interesting true statements. And then like 20% noises. That's

753
02:36:05,079 --> 02:36:11,510
kind of how the stream works. I'm here for the true. Yeah, I got to give myself some credit,

754
02:36:11,510 --> 02:36:14,709
you know. Okay. Yeah. You're here for like 20% like interesting statements.

755
02:36:16,360 --> 02:36:25,430
I got to give myself at least 20%. Wait, whoa, whoa. What did I just do? What happened? I went

756
02:36:25,430 --> 02:36:44,040
out. I went out the Halloween exit. Oh no. Shit. Should I reset it? Oh, come on. I just was ready.

757
02:36:44,840 --> 02:36:59,319
No, I can't. I don't. What the fuck? Oh no. I'll just go back and do it again. I made a lot of

758
02:36:59,319 --> 02:37:11,659
money. Whatever. You can go back. I can go back tomorrow. I'll be fine. I'll be fine. Don't worry,

759
02:37:11,659 --> 02:37:23,000
son. It was just some men in costumes. I am now. I whatever. I fucked up. I'm done with that. I'll

760
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:38,520
go back tomorrow. He didn't like the way he screamed at me. I had four seconds to hit B.

761
02:37:40,729 --> 02:37:44,569
It's okay. It's okay. We're going to go to McDonald's. We're going to go to McDonald's.

762
02:37:48,200 --> 02:37:57,239
Is that what you want? You want to go to McDonald's? Yes. Of course you do. And I

763
02:37:57,239 --> 02:38:11,129
want a large fry. Okay. You can have a large fry. Okay. And then because it's Halloween,

764
02:38:11,770 --> 02:38:15,780
the McDonald's employees are just kind of having fun. And we pull up to the fucking

765
02:38:15,780 --> 02:38:20,100
drive-thru and this guy in a scary mask that's just like, hello. Here you go. Thanks for coming

766
02:38:20,100 --> 02:38:29,129
to McDonald's. Oh shit. No, no, no, no, no. It's okay. It's okay. That's just a scary guy in a

767
02:38:29,129 --> 02:38:35,770
costume. It's okay. We'll go to Dairy Queen. We'll go to Dairy Queen right now. We will? Yeah.

768
02:38:46,139 --> 02:38:54,020
It's a scary guy in a costume. No, no, no. I meant like a guy that was scary because he was in the

769
02:38:54,020 --> 02:39:01,059
costume. Not a guy that was scary because whatever. Hello. I'm still on the, I am still on

770
02:39:01,780 --> 02:39:11,979
the I am from debt collectors. Well, the time being still on the lamb. What does that mean?

771
02:39:12,059 --> 02:39:23,829
Still on the lamb. On the lamb. L-A-M is it, is it, is it not B? What is L-A-M's? What is that?

772
02:39:23,829 --> 02:39:31,299
I don't know what that is. L-A-M-B is like lamb. Lamb. I've never heard that presented that way.

773
02:39:33,030 --> 02:39:38,010
Lamb. To hit someone hard. To attack someone. Shit. I didn't know that.

774
02:39:53,940 --> 02:40:07,100
I can go back there and the, the, yeah, I'm going back here. Yeah. I wish you were my dad. No,

775
02:40:07,100 --> 02:40:16,739
you do not. It would be, you would not like me as your dad. You would be listening to this from the

776
02:40:16,739 --> 02:40:24,059
other room and be incredibly embarrassed. You would have friends over and you'd be doing whatever

777
02:40:24,059 --> 02:40:27,260
you're doing, hanging out in your room and you would hear like, oh, look at me. Oh, the wee,

778
02:40:27,260 --> 02:40:31,979
yes, a piece of shit. This thing sucks. Fuck you. You'd hear that and you'd be like embarrassing to

779
02:40:31,979 --> 02:40:40,360
have friends over. You would make sure that on stream days you were far away from this house.

780
02:40:42,389 --> 02:40:45,670
I'm not sure you would like that. Okay. So now I'm going to go back to that cave.

781
02:40:50,389 --> 02:41:07,020
My dad's a streamer. You know, I'm actually kind of surprised that like Nickelodeon or the Disney

782
02:41:07,020 --> 02:41:14,020
channel has not done that. Like my dad, the streamer. And they play like the, the handful

783
02:41:14,020 --> 02:41:19,540
of guitar riffs before the intro starts. And the person sits down there like, oh man, it's so crazy

784
02:41:19,540 --> 02:41:27,340
living in this house. And they introduce all the characters. My dad, the streamer is just, you'll

785
02:41:27,340 --> 02:41:34,860
see. It'll happen. They did that with iCarly. Yeah. But I'm, that's not my dad, the streamer.

786
02:41:34,860 --> 02:41:54,579
That's iCarly. Wait, in our, was iCarly's dad a streamer? My dad's a VTuber. My dad, the VTuber.

787
02:42:01,219 --> 02:42:06,809
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. It would be like my digital family. And they all have their

788
02:42:06,809 --> 02:42:19,110
own little like avatars. That's real. What do you mean that's real? That's, that's, that Disney

789
02:42:19,110 --> 02:42:32,309
channel has that. There's a VTuber family. That's a TV. What? Okay. I have to play the game. I got

790
02:42:32,309 --> 02:42:42,629
to, I gotta go. That's an actual show? There's treasure somewhere over here. Where is it?

791
02:42:45,129 --> 02:42:56,409
Dude, dude, dude, there's treasure here. Dude, it's up there, I think. I'm gonna throw some whites up

792
02:42:56,409 --> 02:43:21,000
there. It spreads. Dude, it's definitely right there. Oh, nice. What is it? We'll dig it out

793
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:36,629
already. My dad, the VTuber. Oh, onion, onion ring. He made mustard cheese dip. That sounds

794
02:43:36,629 --> 02:43:46,409
actually pretty good. Don't. They're gonna go in the water. You see that? Okay. Well, good thing I

795
02:43:46,409 --> 02:43:58,549
caught that. Come this way. The great reveal. Uh, that was supposed to be very scary, but

796
02:43:59,190 --> 02:44:16,579
I, uh, and now I know it's there. I just, I just think of Donkey Kong. All right. I need, um,

797
02:44:16,579 --> 02:44:27,559
purples. That's not Toad. That's the bird from Donkey Kong. Come on up. Show yourself. He's like

798
02:44:27,559 --> 02:44:45,180
right here. There you are. Oh, he ate a poison one. Good. That's good. Watch out. It's okay. All

799
02:44:45,180 --> 02:45:05,780
right. Get off. Get back up. Where is he? No, no, no, no, no, no. Stop eating them. Why is nobody

800
02:45:05,780 --> 02:45:21,299
attaching to him? Why? I, what the fuck is going on? How am I missing? I can't reach him from here

801
02:45:21,299 --> 02:45:32,709
then. God, this Wiimote. I seriously feel like somebody's strangling me right now with their

802
02:45:32,709 --> 02:45:44,860
hands around my neck, trying to aim this. I can't even, nobody can even reach there.

803
02:45:45,579 --> 02:45:52,229
Nobody can actually, I can't throw anybody over there. Aim for the head. I'm trying to hold on.

804
02:45:57,430 --> 02:45:59,110
Let me, let me aim over there. Hold on.

805
02:46:17,270 --> 02:46:32,860
Dad, dad, shut up. I got a girl over. I have like, I suppose I'm getting ready for prom,

806
02:46:32,860 --> 02:46:41,530
dad. What the fuck? Stop, please. Please don't do this right now. He just hit me through the wall.

807
02:46:53,430 --> 02:46:58,469
Oh my God. Maybe I'm going to lean in. Oh wow. She looked, I'm going to have my first kiss.

808
02:46:59,110 --> 02:47:02,149
What the heck? Oh my God. My heart is going crazy.

809
02:47:06,709 --> 02:47:12,229
What was that? What was that? Do you hear that? I don't know. No, I don't know. I must have dropped

810
02:47:12,229 --> 02:47:39,030
something on his foot. My dad, the streamer. I need to give you a kid to talk, like on stream

811
02:47:39,750 --> 02:48:01,829
for content. That's not, that would be not okay. That would be terrible. I want some more blues.

812
02:48:01,829 --> 02:48:07,750
I don't have like any blues, do I? All the blues died. All right. Put back some yellows. I have

813
02:48:07,750 --> 02:48:21,959
way too many yellows. It's educational. What are you talking about? Oh fuck. I don't have any blue

814
02:48:21,959 --> 02:48:28,340
left. That's not good. That's really bad actually. Oh, okay. Well,

815
02:48:39,020 --> 02:48:39,819
ding, ding, ding, ding.

816
02:48:43,420 --> 02:48:46,620
There you go. That's how every single one of those shows starts. It goes,

817
02:48:59,979 --> 02:49:13,670
and then there's like a chorus. What was the one that was, is it,

818
02:49:13,750 --> 02:49:17,110
did you have to take some time to realize.

819
02:49:19,430 --> 02:49:29,450
That hurts. What was that one? Drake and Josh did that one. That just hurt me. Fuck. My voice

820
02:49:29,450 --> 02:49:41,079
hurts. What the hell? And if you don't know, you know, you should never know where nobody's down.

821
02:49:41,079 --> 02:49:49,879
Yeah, I remember that one. Remember the episode where they like make the tree house and they get

822
02:49:49,879 --> 02:49:53,719
stuck in it because they didn't put a door on it and then like drew a door on it. Remember I said

823
02:49:53,719 --> 02:50:01,059
that was like a funny routine and I accidentally stole it from Drake and Josh. Oh, how many white

824
02:50:11,770 --> 02:50:19,500
shoot that again. I actually shoot it again. Come over here. Fire that at me. Fire.

825
02:50:22,629 --> 02:50:37,139
Okay. I was going to say it attaches to me, right? Come on, kill it. Kill it. Kill it. Oh, you punk.

826
02:50:38,200 --> 02:50:45,000
Oh my God. That was dangerous. This is a horrible idea. This is a horrible idea and he's going to

827
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:56,860
kill everybody over there. Isn't he? Please don't. Okay. We're fine. I need blue to pick that up

828
02:50:56,860 --> 02:51:11,340
after we get rid of this guy. Shit. Do not please. Do not bring that back yet. What are you doing

829
02:51:11,340 --> 02:51:15,579
over here? Stop doing that. Nobody fucking move. What are you thinking? All of you. What's wrong

830
02:51:15,579 --> 02:51:38,569
with you? They're not going to get this in time. Why are they going? I could fart on them. I don't

831
02:51:38,569 --> 02:51:58,819
think it'll do it though. I'll try. All right. Fart. All right. Go. But he died. That one just

832
02:51:58,819 --> 02:52:09,819
got worked to death. What was that? Oh, it was red. Oh, come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

833
02:52:09,819 --> 02:52:45,299
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Damn it. I'm trying to get it to hit the wall. Come on. Hit

834
02:52:45,299 --> 02:53:01,940
each other. Hit him. Do it. Oh my God, dude. Watch out. Watch out. Okay. We're good. Now some of you

835
02:53:01,940 --> 02:53:09,780
can bring that back. I want blue to pick up this because we're running out of blue. Blue and purple.

836
02:53:10,739 --> 02:53:31,659
Please. Couple. What? What the hell happened? At least that shit will be dead tomorrow. You wasted

837
02:53:31,659 --> 02:53:38,299
a whole day talking about Drake and Josh. And I could probably waste a few days talking about

838
02:53:38,299 --> 02:54:16,979
Drake and Josh. What a show. Yes. Okay. We'll go back to that tomorrow. You were 20 when that show

839
02:54:16,979 --> 02:54:31,180
aired. Um, yeah. I was like 19 or something. I didn't watch Drake and Josh. So what? I'm like,

840
02:54:31,180 --> 02:54:35,180
if I'm like 18 years old, 19, 20 years old, I can't enjoy an episode of Drake and Josh.

841
02:54:35,899 --> 02:54:51,049
It's not for you. How many of you have Pokemon installed on your Switch right now or your Wii

842
02:54:51,049 --> 02:54:57,579
or something? How many of you guys play Pokemon? How many? How many of you guys are over the age

843
02:54:57,579 --> 02:55:04,940
of 18 that I can't wait for the next Pokemon game to come out? But I can't watch an episode

844
02:55:04,940 --> 02:55:16,090
of Drake and Josh when I'm 20. Okay. Is that, but is that, that's not for you though. It's like a

845
02:55:16,090 --> 02:55:21,000
game for, they make it that game for like a younger audience. You can't, you can't play that. Right?

846
02:55:22,760 --> 02:55:32,520
Right guys? Wait, what am I doing? Continue. What did I just do? Did I not save the game?

847
02:55:33,159 --> 02:55:50,100
All right. We're going back. Hey, I'm playing this. I'm playing Pikmin right now and you're

848
02:55:50,100 --> 02:55:56,809
here watching Pikmin. What does that make both of us? But we're not, you're not allowed to play

849
02:55:56,809 --> 02:56:06,379
something because it was made to have like a general audience in mind. Excuse me. What's wrong

850
02:56:06,379 --> 02:56:28,489
with that? I only have two blues. We've got to change that. Is there any bigger ones out here?

851
02:56:28,489 --> 02:56:44,180
I don't think so. Listen, like Pikmin. Okay. Cute does not mean only for children. Like look,

852
02:56:44,180 --> 02:56:49,139
Pikmin, Olimar. Look, it's like a cute game with like Pikmins and they're so cute. And so look at

853
02:56:49,139 --> 02:57:09,379
them. They're just like, Oh, only children can play this. That's not fair. I want at least like

854
02:57:09,379 --> 02:57:32,969
six or seven. Wait, so you're not a child. No, I just act like one. Doesn't make me a kid. I'm

855
02:57:32,969 --> 02:57:41,670
just one. I'm just a little kid that is wearing the suit. I'm wearing the suit glasses. Like a

856
02:57:41,670 --> 02:57:47,110
nice pair of loafers as a joke in whatever movie or TV show you're watching. We're like, oh no,

857
02:57:47,110 --> 02:57:58,280
the kid's got to be an adult. He's doing taxes. All right. So I got enough blue, I think. I do

858
02:57:58,280 --> 02:58:18,920
need a bunch of red. I need white. 30. Boss baby Andy. 30, 30. And then N9. That's a pretty good

859
02:58:18,920 --> 02:58:28,569
Nickelodeon sound by the way. This one. So let's supplement that with a little bit more yellow.

860
02:58:34,329 --> 02:58:40,809
Okay. I have a ton of yellow. This is a yellow run. All right. Let's go. Who needs a nectar?

861
02:58:52,420 --> 02:59:01,860
Drink it. I want you to be big and strong. Hit the bong on camera. I don't have a bong. I don't

862
02:59:01,860 --> 02:59:09,139
smoke weed. I eat it. If I need to, if I feel like it, or if I want to. I do not really smoke

863
02:59:09,139 --> 02:59:13,540
it. It irritates my throat. Just going to be completely honest with you. I don't like to

864
02:59:13,540 --> 02:59:29,860
smoke weed because I feel like it's an irritant. It's an irritant. I love that snowman. It's so cute.

865
02:59:32,709 --> 02:59:38,920
Okay. We dealt with that bird last time. Now we got this bridge. We went over here.

866
02:59:40,090 --> 02:59:49,379
There was that fence. Where was that fence? Up this way. There we go. Okay. Monka. Oh,

867
02:59:49,379 --> 03:00:03,479
there it is. Monka. Yes. Okay. I found it. White. There's another cave over here.

868
03:00:06,360 --> 03:00:13,819
Anything this way? Let me just look over here. Um, this is the, oh, there's a, there's a couple

869
03:00:13,819 --> 03:00:16,780
of caves. This is that cave, right? Okay. Wait, I'm going to go on this one first.

870
03:00:18,700 --> 03:00:27,510
I think Monka. Whatever. I'm trying to stuff it in there. It's hard. The crown. Yep. Yep. Yep.

871
03:00:27,510 --> 03:00:40,409
Where's that crown? He left three yellows behind. Oh shit, I did. More than that. Did I get them?

872
03:00:40,969 --> 03:00:50,739
They just won't cross the bridge because they're dumb. What's your favorite bug?

873
03:00:51,940 --> 03:01:03,670
Um, one of those big emperor beetles. Whatever they're called. The ones with the gigantic faces.

874
03:01:04,389 --> 03:01:08,790
They have the long noses, the long jaws. They have the big twig face. What are they called?

875
03:01:08,790 --> 03:01:20,729
Hercules beetle. Yep. That's one. I, if a Hercules beetle was on my floor right now, I would not

876
03:01:20,809 --> 03:01:26,979
freak out. The bigger the bug, the less scared I will be of it. If a Hercules beetle walked into

877
03:01:26,979 --> 03:01:31,860
this room right now, I would not get up and go, oh my God, what the fuck is that? No. I'd be like,

878
03:01:31,860 --> 03:01:37,670
holy shit, that's a Hercules beetle. This is cool. Uh, if a, if a spider as big as my thumbnail

879
03:01:37,670 --> 03:01:42,629
showed up in front of me, I would scream like a little kid. I would freak out. I would sprint

880
03:01:42,629 --> 03:01:49,319
around. All the hairs on my body would stand up and I would, I wouldn't be able to come in this

881
03:01:49,319 --> 03:01:54,600
room. I would have to stay out of this room for a few days. I wouldn't be able to go, I would not

882
03:01:54,600 --> 03:02:05,879
be able to come in here. Uh, but a huge bug would just be, okay, that's a big bug. All right. This

883
03:02:05,879 --> 03:02:21,879
guy doesn't want to go over here. Come on. I want to finish this cave. Big spider. Actually, no,

884
03:02:21,879 --> 03:02:30,440
I want this. Yeah. Let's get this. All right. Can I get this without having to deal with this guy?

885
03:02:31,079 --> 03:02:52,299
I don't think I can. I have to kill that thing. How am I going to do this? Just punch him with

886
03:02:52,379 --> 03:03:18,760
Olimar. I can try that. I don't think I can even get up there. I don't have damage.

887
03:03:29,739 --> 03:03:53,530
Wait a minute. I've got an idea. Ah, am I safe right here? I think it'll, I think it's going to

888
03:03:53,530 --> 03:04:20,020
hit the wall. Yep. I'm safe right here. This is perfect. Kill. Oh shit. Everybody died. Perfect.

889
03:04:20,020 --> 03:04:23,299
Nice. All right. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good. We need blue to pick these

890
03:04:23,299 --> 03:04:45,319
up. Blue, follow me. I need blue to get everything here. So let's do this right. We need, okay. We've

891
03:04:45,319 --> 03:04:50,579
spread out. I wish I could hold C and make them spread out even further. I'm fucking wee.

892
03:04:50,579 --> 03:05:10,059
Fucking stupid. Fucking wee. Fucking wee. Right. What are you expecting? I need like a, okay. So

893
03:05:10,059 --> 03:05:25,510
we need a purple and a blue. Good. Okay. Now we need a purple and a blue. Good. Purple and a blue.

894
03:05:25,510 --> 03:05:38,059
All right. What happened to, I'll take a break after this level. Oh, and then the rest of you

895
03:05:38,059 --> 03:05:45,129
get that crown. Oh, you motherfuckers. I swear to God. Why are you doing that?

896
03:05:45,850 --> 03:05:53,979
Why are you doing that? Do what? Cause you walked over here. I didn't tell them to do that. So why

897
03:05:53,979 --> 03:05:57,819
are they doing it? I did not tell. I did not say anybody. I did not tell them to do that.

898
03:05:57,819 --> 03:06:19,850
So why are you doing it? Oh God damn it. It's going to kill these guys. Isn't he? I know he is.

899
03:06:19,850 --> 03:06:31,879
This is such a pain in the ass. You better not attack those guys. I will be so, I'll be furious.

900
03:06:31,879 --> 03:07:11,110
All right. Hurry up. Get back to base now. The rest of you get this. Let's go. Raid song. Raid

901
03:07:11,110 --> 03:07:18,420
song. Oh shit. All shame, no wow with the raid. Thanks dude. Welcome everybody. I'll give you a

902
03:07:18,420 --> 03:07:30,200
song. It just takes some time to realize when you show boat, you show me, you show down, you show me

903
03:07:30,200 --> 03:07:43,290
around. Thanks for the raid. Welcome. Am I going to be able to do this in time? Nah. Hope you had a

904
03:07:43,370 --> 03:07:47,450
good stream. Thanks. Welcome everybody. I'm playing Pikmin 2 for the Nintendo Wii U.

905
03:07:48,090 --> 03:07:52,459
The upscaled version from the GameCube to the Wii and then the Wii version ported to the Wii U.

906
03:07:53,100 --> 03:08:07,370
I know. I know. It annoys me too. Name one other character from that show.

907
03:08:08,010 --> 03:08:18,379
Come on. You can get there. Please get there. Don't make this a waste of time.

908
03:08:19,180 --> 03:08:26,040
Are they actually not going to get there? Name one character from that show that's not Drake

909
03:08:26,040 --> 03:08:36,170
and Josh. I don't know. Didn't they work at a movie theater? Josh worked at a movie theater.

910
03:08:38,940 --> 03:08:47,139
There was a movie theater employee that he worked with. Whoever that was. I don't know.

911
03:08:47,139 --> 03:08:56,700
All right. Well, I have 10 seconds left for them to bring these back. Only 120 what? Unspeakable

912
03:08:56,700 --> 03:09:10,950
wonder. 70% of debt has been recovered. 10 seconds. Shit. At least get me one of them in there. Come

913
03:09:10,950 --> 03:09:40,360
on. Come on. Hurry. Four. Three. Two. They're not going to get it. I'm missing somebody. Oh,

914
03:09:40,360 --> 03:09:53,819
just a few reds. Who cares? If it was purple, I would be very upset. It's just like two reds.

915
03:09:54,379 --> 03:10:00,899
At least I got the... The crown was a pain in the ass.

916
03:10:09,510 --> 03:10:23,049
Jeremy, sing the Skyrim theme song, but say Monka S instead. I don't. I really don't know what the

917
03:10:23,049 --> 03:10:35,290
Skyrim theme song is. It's the one that's like... I've never heard it before. What is it? I don't

918
03:10:35,290 --> 03:10:39,940
know. Well, the animals that adopted me are actually rather cute once you get used to them.

919
03:10:39,940 --> 03:10:47,159
Once we get the debt paid off, I might build a refuge for them. What do you think? This is not

920
03:10:47,159 --> 03:10:54,500
a pre-recorded stream. Get out of here. Hey, as they say in England, fuck off. You know what I

921
03:10:54,500 --> 03:11:00,920
mean? As they say in England, fuck off, mate. All right. I want to go back in there and go to the

922
03:11:00,920 --> 03:11:11,930
cave. Let's take a break. I'm going to go pee. I'm going to refill my... Well, I have coffee.

923
03:11:11,930 --> 03:11:17,379
Pretending I'm not drinking coffee. I'm going to drink some water, get a little bit more coffee,

924
03:11:17,379 --> 03:11:21,819
and we will continue. Be right back. Don't go anywhere unless you have to go somewhere.

925
03:11:22,950 --> 03:11:27,270
But definitely don't switch to the Super Bowl. I'll tell you the score right now. It's zero to

926
03:11:27,270 --> 03:11:40,340
zero. Tom Brady has 15 interceptions. It's an absolute disaster for him. At least that would

927
03:11:40,340 --> 03:14:37,260
be like... Whatever. I'll be back. What the hell is that? The ultimate gamer chair? The saw trap.

928
03:14:38,459 --> 03:14:43,340
I got a question for you. Those of you guys that have or have ever experienced any time

929
03:14:43,979 --> 03:14:49,670
with a refrigerator that has an ice maker in it? You have your ice. Water can come out of there

930
03:14:49,670 --> 03:14:56,409
usually. And there's always the thing that says crushed ice. There's regular ice and then you

931
03:14:56,409 --> 03:15:03,079
press the button. It's crushed ice. Has that ever worked in any fridge you've ever used with a

932
03:15:03,079 --> 03:15:11,239
crushed ice? Doesn't it just spit out regular ice cubes but make loud fucking noises? Why is

933
03:15:11,239 --> 03:15:22,620
that even on any fridge? I don't get it. I've never seen that work. It just goes... Ice cubes.

934
03:15:23,059 --> 03:15:27,500
And some of them are broken. I don't even know why they put... Why do they even put that shit on

935
03:15:27,500 --> 03:15:40,780
fridges? That doesn't make any sense. It doesn't do anything. You have a bad fridge. This has been

936
03:15:40,780 --> 03:15:49,909
every fridge I've ever used that's ever had across multiple states and multiple continents

937
03:15:49,909 --> 03:15:55,350
that I've never used the crushed ice fridge feature that has ever worked the way it's supposed

938
03:15:55,350 --> 03:16:04,149
to be intended. I swear to god this is the last time I'll ever draw a German with a cat feature.

939
03:16:04,149 --> 03:16:14,729
I swear. I swear. I promise. Sub. I'm serious. I've never seen it work. I thought that was

940
03:16:14,729 --> 03:16:25,399
supposed to be Cheeto and I was like, holy shit. That's from a spore. All right. Let's keep going.

941
03:16:26,360 --> 03:16:43,100
I want to go back in that cave. I love this game. It's very fun. All right. I want to go back in

942
03:16:43,100 --> 03:16:51,940
that cave. Please read my chat message. Okay. What does it say? I've beaten Pikmin 2 and I've been

943
03:16:51,940 --> 03:17:05,239
trying to give you tips. Well, I mean, there's almost 11,000 people here. Everyone's trying...

944
03:17:06,200 --> 03:17:11,219
Look at the amount of tips that people are screaming at me. Half of them aren't even real.

945
03:17:12,840 --> 03:17:17,239
Now, if I pay attention to your tips, what if they're not real? What if they're fake?

946
03:17:17,239 --> 03:17:19,719
If you're trying to get me to throw a Pikmin off the bridge or something.

947
03:17:31,110 --> 03:17:37,510
Ban if not real. No. I appreciate the tips though. I appreciate any tips you could give me except,

948
03:17:37,510 --> 03:17:41,430
I mean, do I have a no back seating rule on this channel? I really don't.

949
03:17:42,860 --> 03:17:47,450
No. People just write whatever they want. Half of it could be fake bullshit.

950
03:17:50,120 --> 03:17:56,139
I want to go back in that cave, but I'll be okay. I'm going to be totally honest with you.

951
03:17:57,799 --> 03:18:02,629
Back seating for me? Like, I'm not going to listen to you anyways. How many times have you

952
03:18:02,629 --> 03:18:05,510
guys written something in here that was actually helpful? And I just didn't even care. I didn't

953
03:18:05,510 --> 03:18:11,819
look at it. Like, I'm not going to listen anyways. That's happened many times. So it's not like I

954
03:18:11,819 --> 03:18:25,850
have to have a rule. Why do I need a rule if I already don't pay attention? Why do I even try?

955
03:18:26,809 --> 03:18:34,409
Look, it's all right. Everything's just good. I don't need any tips. I appreciate the tips,

956
03:18:35,049 --> 03:18:40,579
but I don't need them because I'm a professional video game player.

957
03:18:40,579 --> 03:18:53,719
And we went over that on the spore stream. Please tell me to go to the secret hole.

958
03:18:56,569 --> 03:19:08,540
That sounds like a pretty good tip, actually. There's a secret hole, a secret tunnel.

959
03:19:09,100 --> 03:19:16,629
Why did everything respawn? Hold on. Itchy inside of my ear. How did I lost somebody? 99 out of 100.

960
03:19:16,629 --> 03:19:23,219
Where's the last one? I don't know where they are, but it's too late.

961
03:19:26,170 --> 03:19:35,780
I'm not going to fight anything. I'm just going to go. I just want to go in the cave.

962
03:19:36,340 --> 03:19:51,659
Why am I not feeding the Pikmin? I am. I'm going to give them the nectar. Let's go.

963
03:19:51,659 --> 03:20:01,430
What's my opinion on roly-polys? The weird bugs that you find under the welcome mat?

964
03:20:02,700 --> 03:20:13,479
Um, they're all right. Do I start on? What floor am I on? Floor one?

965
03:20:14,809 --> 03:20:21,579
Shit. This is the first floor, isn't it? Damn it. It's the first goddamn floor.

966
03:20:22,299 --> 03:20:28,940
Wait, technically I could run, right? Hold on. Technically I could just run and just go in.

967
03:20:28,940 --> 03:20:40,920
I don't have to do any of this. I could just run. Okay, here we go. Where's the exit? Wait,

968
03:20:40,920 --> 03:21:02,790
purple. Don't wake that motherfucker up. Get out of here. Did I just lose a white? Oh, man.

969
03:21:04,629 --> 03:21:20,819
No, I didn't. I did. Shit. Same button. Nintendo. Why? I'm going to back up. In fact,

970
03:21:20,819 --> 03:21:35,459
I don't trust any of you, so stay here. Oh, it's right here. Move. Go invent a console if

971
03:21:35,459 --> 03:21:47,159
you keep complaining. I'm kidding. I don't actually believe any of these things.

972
03:21:47,959 --> 03:22:20,629
I hope you know that. Okay, everyone get out of the way with a big Kappa. Kappa. I was on level

973
03:22:20,629 --> 03:22:32,500
five or six before. This guy still believes in Santa. What a wild concept that we pretend is

974
03:22:32,500 --> 03:22:44,420
real for like five to 10 years of people's lives. That's sort of bizarre if you think about it.

975
03:22:44,420 --> 03:22:49,780
We just kind of like pretend that Santa's just a real thing. Oh, yeah, yeah. Santa's a real guy.

976
03:22:51,899 --> 03:23:19,260
Run away. Run away. Run away. Where's the exit? Wait, little guys. There's only one. Santa is real.

977
03:23:21,879 --> 03:23:28,469
Where's the exit? Thank God he's stuck there. Okay, where's the exit though? Right there. All

978
03:23:28,469 --> 03:23:51,940
right. I mean, Santa was a real guy, but like 500 years ago, 800 years ago or something. Saint Nick,

979
03:23:51,940 --> 03:24:03,860
right? Saint Nicholas. Isn't that based on a real thing? He used to put like toys in people's shoes

980
03:24:03,860 --> 03:24:15,100
and stuff. It's based on something. What is it actually based on? What is it? No, it was a real

981
03:24:15,100 --> 03:24:21,989
person. It was a real like a tale of a guy that did that. Oh, not Krampus. All right, this is the

982
03:24:21,989 --> 03:24:26,549
one that I don't want to leave. There's a treasure on this one. And there's more purples to be had.

983
03:24:32,200 --> 03:24:51,030
Red. Isn't it something in the Bible? Yeah, but there was a guy. Who is the guy?

984
03:24:53,670 --> 03:25:04,629
Santa Claus is based on an actual living person. What was it? Patron saint of... Patron,

985
03:25:04,629 --> 03:25:13,239
whatever. But fun fact, the actual Saint Nick punched a guy in the nose.

986
03:25:15,860 --> 03:25:19,860
No, no, no, no, no. It's somebody else. Saint Nicholas is the patron saint of sailors,

987
03:25:19,860 --> 03:25:25,299
merchants, archers, repentant thieves, prostitutes, children, brewers, palm brokers,

988
03:25:25,299 --> 03:25:32,420
unmarried people, and students in various cities and countries. What? Thank you for subscribing to

989
03:25:32,420 --> 03:25:38,579
Fun Bug Facts. A vroly-poly vulgar has also been introduced to many locations in North America where

990
03:25:38,579 --> 03:25:42,950
maybe each population is absent, whatever. And what does that have anything to do with Santa Claus?

991
03:25:43,510 --> 03:25:48,299
Santa Claus is based on Saint Nick, who is a guy who left gold coins in prostitutes' laundry to

992
03:25:48,299 --> 03:26:14,090
let... I don't even know if any of this stuff is... Thank God there's no timer. Oh, I don't want to

993
03:26:14,090 --> 03:26:33,770
pick up anybody. Jerry, I don't want to pick anybody up. I just want the yellow one. You know

994
03:26:33,770 --> 03:26:41,850
what's really interesting? So Seinfeld is a really, really old show. Nobody really pays that much

995
03:26:41,850 --> 03:26:45,850
attention to it anymore. You guys think it's funny. You guys think that George is hilarious

996
03:26:45,850 --> 03:26:50,729
and shit, and Jerry and stuff. That's really interesting. That's a really timeless show then.

997
03:26:52,979 --> 03:26:59,020
Oh, that's really interesting to think about that. Is that a guy electric too?

998
03:27:01,450 --> 03:27:23,159
It holds up. Oh yeah, I mean... Swarm. Swarm him. Take the swarm. Yeah, the swarm. That sounds like

999
03:27:23,159 --> 03:27:35,620
a new keyboard. The swarm GX500. Loudest mechanical keyboard on the market. Let everybody know.

1000
03:27:36,870 --> 03:27:53,620
Just how much you're gaming with the swarm. Sounds like a bunch of bees. All right, electricity.

1001
03:27:56,739 --> 03:28:04,389
I have a quiet mechanical keyboard. I like soft. What do I have? A red? Cherry red? That's the one

1002
03:28:04,389 --> 03:28:13,909
that's a little softer, right? Didn't get anybody. Tough luck. Cherry red is with the O-rings, right?

1003
03:28:13,909 --> 03:28:19,190
I think that's what this is. Oh shit, I just completely... Well, I just absolutely exposed

1004
03:28:19,190 --> 03:28:26,379
myself. Yeah, no, it's all right. I just exposed myself 100%. I'm no longer using the Amazon Basics

1005
03:28:26,379 --> 03:28:32,620
keyboard. I told you guys that I was using that. I got a new, like a Corsair keyboard or something.

1006
03:28:32,620 --> 03:28:50,260
I don't know. All right, can we kill this guy, please? No, give me my friends back. Weigh him

1007
03:28:50,260 --> 03:29:06,809
down. Don't let him... Don't kill them. Weigh him down. Oh my God. How is this even missing?

1008
03:29:10,149 --> 03:29:26,500
Just rained down on his head. Okay, I don't know what any of this shit is, but take it.

1009
03:29:34,500 --> 03:29:35,059
What are they saying?

1010
03:29:39,030 --> 03:29:53,370
I can't. My voice is too hot low. I so badly just want to do the I-uh thing.

1011
03:29:54,709 --> 03:29:58,629
I just wanted to do it right now and I don't care what the repercussions are.

1012
03:29:59,350 --> 03:30:12,100
Oh, it's like a marble. There's so many of these enemies here right now.

1013
03:30:19,190 --> 03:30:31,459
You better not. Who's gonna tell you to stop? I'm gonna unsub if you do. How many people will

1014
03:30:31,459 --> 03:30:36,979
sub if I do it? That's a better question. Can we offset the sub that that guy I'm gonna lose from

1015
03:30:36,979 --> 03:30:51,579
that guy? I will. I'll sub if you do it. How many people will unsubscribe if I do that and how many

1016
03:30:51,579 --> 03:30:58,360
people will subscribe if I do that? This is tricky. I will gift a sub. Okay, this one, two,

1017
03:31:09,100 --> 03:31:26,700
pull. I don't trust a pull with that. You guys will just pretend I lose somebody. All right,

1018
03:31:26,700 --> 03:31:36,020
be careful in here. All right, pick him up. Let's see. I'm curious. I'm just gonna do it.

1019
03:31:36,020 --> 03:31:50,579
Whatever. Do it. Do it then. I'm gonna. I'm just thinking about when I want to do it.

1020
03:31:50,579 --> 03:31:58,629
I'm trying to get a good time. Don't. Please. I think I'm gonna get like a hundred subs if I do

1021
03:31:58,629 --> 03:32:07,420
that. 50 to 60 of you will unsubscribe and like a hundred will subscribe. So that's a net 40,

1022
03:32:07,420 --> 03:32:24,069
I guess, gain, right? Exactly, huh? All right, so if I say that word and I get a net 100,

1023
03:32:24,069 --> 03:32:30,809
a net 40, then if I say shpee immediately afterwards, will you come back? All those unsubscribed.

1024
03:32:37,850 --> 03:32:40,569
That's gonna be really. That's gonna fuck with the whole community, okay?

1025
03:32:41,799 --> 03:32:45,000
Because it's one thing that everybody hates and one thing that everybody loves. So I'm gonna.

1026
03:32:45,000 --> 03:32:48,920
This is gonna pull you guys apart. You guys are gonna get sucked through like an internet wormhole.

1027
03:32:49,399 --> 03:33:04,969
Shpee. What happened? Everybody all right? Is everybody okay? I don't know what happened.

1028
03:33:04,969 --> 03:33:18,899
Is everything. Is it going still here? Oh, shit. I'm losing subs. I'm losing subs, but I'm gaining

1029
03:33:18,899 --> 03:33:34,819
subs. I'm just kidding. Maybe we should do it again. All right. Watch out for these gliders.

1030
03:33:34,819 --> 03:33:43,030
I'm gonna call them gliders. Well, thanks for the community subs. Get away. He took me.

1031
03:33:52,170 --> 03:33:59,399
Get away from me. As long as it's not the Bane impression, it's fine. How many subs

1032
03:33:59,399 --> 03:34:13,459
to the Bane impression? Oh, my God. I just get everybody over here and spam. Stop it.

1033
03:34:13,459 --> 03:34:39,579
I hate these things. Pick me up every fucking time. Just get him. Put us down. Why is he getting us?

1034
03:34:40,219 --> 03:35:05,100
What the fuck? Finally. Geez. Kill him. I didn't say it. That could have been Elmo.

1035
03:35:23,989 --> 03:35:38,020
Just step on his head. Okay. Apologize. It's kind of fun to say though. You know that I say this

1036
03:35:38,020 --> 03:35:45,159
like in my off time. It's fun just to go. It's fun to do it. I don't know. It's nothing about it.

1037
03:35:45,799 --> 03:36:23,819
Why are they not attaching to him? Put us down. And now we're gonna die. Fucking dad. Ayayaying

1038
03:36:23,819 --> 03:36:33,620
again. The streamer dad. Boy. I wonder if I'm gonna get my first kiss.

1039
03:36:34,500 --> 03:36:38,379
Ayayaying. Dad, what the heck?

1040
03:36:58,629 --> 03:37:20,899
I hate that so much. What's that? Is that a starburst? Are you okay? Yeah, I think so. Oh,

1041
03:37:20,899 --> 03:37:35,270
you didn't say. Oh, I forgot. Shmee. There you go. How do I get health as Olimar? I need some nectar

1042
03:37:35,270 --> 03:37:56,299
too. I have a lot of new Pikmin. Get away. The ship will give you health? Oh, okay. You are dumb

1043
03:37:56,299 --> 03:38:15,559
dumb. Ha ha ha ha. Is Shmee gonna be on your gravestone? No. I hope not. Why is this not

1044
03:38:15,559 --> 03:38:38,940
giving me health? You lied to me. What is that guy? Press C. Why is he doing that? What do I do?

1045
03:38:44,739 --> 03:38:55,340
Hold C. What the hell? Hold C. I just did. This doesn't exit me from the level or something,

1046
03:38:55,340 --> 03:39:19,670
right? I'm holding C. Hold C. He's not doing anything. Okay, well, there's like a yeti over

1047
03:39:19,670 --> 03:39:52,250
here. You're stupid. What? Do it away from the Pikmin. That's not doing anything. Okay,

1048
03:39:52,809 --> 03:40:06,600
let's go for it. I want purples. We're gonna overwhelm. Three, two, one, go. Everyone's alive.

1049
03:40:06,600 --> 03:40:24,309
Nobody died. Oh, what's that? A butterfly? What is that? Who's in the ground here? Did I just get

1050
03:40:24,309 --> 03:40:31,780
more Pikmin? Okay, I'm gonna put some yellow in this. Or maybe some red. What do I have the most

1051
03:40:31,780 --> 03:40:58,040
of? Let's get red. Red's the easiest to get. They all missed. And aim. Oh my god. And aim.

1052
03:40:58,760 --> 03:41:05,719
Can we start banning? Can we start banning these people? Like, can we start? They're making fun of

1053
03:41:05,719 --> 03:41:12,219
me. Can we start banning them and making sure they don't show up again? Wicked funny. Everyone's so

1054
03:41:12,219 --> 03:41:33,700
funny. Can we start putting out bans, please? E and them. E and them. Cry baby. One, two, three,

1055
03:41:33,700 --> 03:41:42,729
four, five. I wish I wanted to get this to stop talking. Wait, if I switch to... Okay,

1056
03:41:43,370 --> 03:41:51,940
Louie's the one that's almost dead. Who cares? Now, oh, more purple. Oh, no, this is blue. Oh,

1057
03:41:51,940 --> 03:42:11,780
shit. Okay, I'm gonna get rid of some more. I'm gonna get rid of some more reds. You have so

1058
03:42:11,780 --> 03:42:17,750
many yellows. I love electricity. It's my favorite element. Electricity is my favorite element,

1059
03:42:17,750 --> 03:42:27,420
so of course I'm gonna want it. All right, what about... Watch out. Be careful here. Blue spider.

1060
03:42:28,649 --> 03:42:38,250
There's a lot of shit in here. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, boy. Well, back it up for a sec.

1061
03:42:38,809 --> 03:43:11,370
Let's take blue over here. Don't wake up everybody. Just be easy. Don't do that. Don't do that. Why

1062
03:43:11,370 --> 03:43:25,639
can you just... This is infuriating me. Hold on. Let me jam the Wiimote into my chest so I can

1063
03:43:25,639 --> 03:43:43,399
fucking aim it right. Why are they not jumping on his head? Oh, that only took like five tries.

1064
03:43:44,120 --> 03:44:06,260
They're friendly. What? Don't hurt them. What? Why not? They're gonna kill me. The Yetis are good.

1065
03:44:15,500 --> 03:44:29,540
Oh, yeah. A smashing claw animation. They're good, huh? Let them hit them. No. No, I'm not

1066
03:44:29,540 --> 03:44:38,100
gonna do that. I'm not gonna do that. Oh, this is not good now. They don't kill them. Frost us,

1067
03:44:38,100 --> 03:45:03,639
please. Fine. You better not be fucking with me. Oh, shit. Okay, cool. Oh, shit. We'll do that to

1068
03:45:03,639 --> 03:45:32,040
more of them. I got a lot of guys you can do that to. No! All right, there's another one.

1069
03:45:32,680 --> 03:45:47,590
I want him to do it to the purples. Get everybody over here. The purples really need to be flowered

1070
03:45:47,670 --> 03:46:13,500
up. Nice miss. Again. Oh, you got it. Nice. Just let him walk around and just do it. Stop moving. I

1071
03:46:13,500 --> 03:46:20,649
feel like he's gonna hit me with it. Okay, good. Okay. The rest of you, come back over here. Who

1072
03:46:20,649 --> 03:46:48,940
else needs it? Oh, look at all these yellows that need it. Come here. Good. All right, one more.

1073
03:46:51,020 --> 03:47:04,250
Okay. I'm done. I'm done. I don't care. I'm done. Kill him. Don't get crushed. All right. Well,

1074
03:47:04,250 --> 03:47:12,059
somebody attacked. Somebody attacked. Kill. Somebody attacked. Nobody had to do it.

1075
03:47:16,659 --> 03:47:32,700
Luis almost dead. Wait, I'm getting bored watching this. So, go watch the Super Bowl. Go watch Tom

1076
03:47:32,700 --> 03:47:51,610
Brady throw 50 interceptions. That's what you're missing. I'm telling you. Is the Super Bowl today?

1077
03:47:51,610 --> 03:48:10,569
Yes. Wait, the Super Bowl was today? Oh, shit. All right, we're good. There's still treasure

1078
03:48:10,569 --> 03:48:20,120
everywhere. Do a Super Bowl watch party. God, no. Okay, I want the nectar. Can I, can, can Olimar

1079
03:48:20,120 --> 03:48:37,510
drink this? Can we drink this? Like, can we drink it out of this? To heal? I don't know. How do we

1080
03:48:37,510 --> 03:48:47,559
heal? Super Bowl watch party, but it's just staring at a TV. Right, yeah. Uh, I think everybody pretty

1081
03:48:47,559 --> 03:49:06,870
much has it, so let's just kill him. Oh, he had a fist. The Super Bowl doesn't need another 10k

1082
03:49:06,870 --> 03:49:27,610
viewers. No, it doesn't. Giant metal hand. Perhaps it's an ancient work of art. What? He's going crazy.

1083
03:49:27,610 --> 03:49:31,290
Emergency. Pikmin are suffering. If you blow your whistle with B, you may be able to help them.

1084
03:49:31,290 --> 03:49:47,110
What's wrong with them? What do you do? Do you take too much DMT? What are you doing? I think we're

1085
03:49:47,110 --> 03:50:04,520
okay. I guess they were, they were suffering somehow. Super Bowl watch party with you staring

1086
03:50:04,520 --> 03:50:12,840
at the TV for six hours and just putting my fist up and going, yeah, after every time my team scores

1087
03:50:12,840 --> 03:50:26,440
points. This object seems to replicate a humanoid fist, a glove much like it once lay in my junk

1088
03:50:26,440 --> 03:50:32,659
hold. And here is that very glove. I have just found the missing rocket fist in my junk hold.

1089
03:50:33,799 --> 03:50:44,549
Tap A three times to launch it. One, two, punch. Oh, cool. Everyone get out of the way.

1090
03:50:46,969 --> 03:50:57,770
Ooh. Boom. Like a little three hit combo. All right. 99. We're good. No more treasure.

1091
03:50:58,409 --> 03:51:10,229
Let's get the hell out of here. That's the Luigi's Mansion.

1092
03:51:20,139 --> 03:51:41,049
Mm hmm. Level six. Not the final area either. Okay. Hold on. Let me just see what's around me.

1093
03:51:42,870 --> 03:51:47,750
What do we got? This is already a horrible place to be standing. Like right off the bat. Oh my god.

1094
03:51:50,420 --> 03:51:58,500
Holy shit, dude. What the fuck are you doing to me? What? You've got to be kidding me.

1095
03:52:01,879 --> 03:52:20,280
What kind of fucking place is this? I'm okay. I'm all right. Back it up. Purple, purple, purple,

1096
03:52:20,280 --> 03:52:29,620
purple, purple, purple, purple. What the fuck? Oh, that was stupid. Two of the homing missile

1097
03:52:29,620 --> 03:52:35,399
guys just sit right in front of the guy. What's with the design there? Who designed that? Terrible

1098
03:52:35,399 --> 03:52:40,040
design. Awful design. Worst design I've ever seen in a video game and I've played lots of them.

1099
03:52:40,680 --> 03:53:00,409
That's RNG. Oh, oh. Never mind. Worst I've ever seen in a video game ever. It's just a dice roll.

1100
03:53:01,049 --> 03:53:24,069
What we got in here? Fire, water. Okay. Don't die from this. Stay right here.

1101
03:53:24,870 --> 03:53:45,610
Okay. Keep going. Is that, what is that thing? Is that fire related?

1102
03:53:46,329 --> 03:53:55,510
I, you're good. You're good. You're good. You're good. You're good. Just get over here.

1103
03:53:56,149 --> 03:54:11,340
Oh, statue. All right. What else we got? All right. I think we're okay. This is going to be such a

1104
03:54:11,340 --> 03:54:56,969
horrible pain in the ass. I have to throw them across this. Almost all of them. It's a purple

1105
03:54:56,969 --> 03:55:13,430
in here. I don't want a purple with me. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here.

1106
03:55:13,430 --> 03:55:28,629
Come here. Now I got a crew. There's like bad guys over here, guys. This is the guy that I'm

1107
03:55:28,629 --> 03:55:51,819
worried about. Pen. Fuck. I'm not going to be able to get that. Oh, punch it. Punch it to death.

1108
03:55:51,819 --> 03:56:32,280
Look at my health though. No, I need big guys. Shoot the rock. Shoot him. Thank you. Okay. Good.

1109
03:56:32,280 --> 03:56:45,620
Good. Good. Good. Good. What else is over here? Fire this way. That's it. Shit. I can't get that.

1110
03:56:45,620 --> 03:56:55,559
I can't get any of these things. I don't have enough blue. Come on. Really? What about the

1111
03:56:55,559 --> 03:57:22,170
Bulbman? A Bulbman? What do you mean a Bulbman? Did Bulbman die in the water? Oh shit. Okay.

1112
03:57:22,170 --> 03:57:56,500
Hold on. Oh, they have Pog. Two. How many do I have? Seven. Eight. Oh, no. There's no more?

1113
03:57:56,500 --> 03:58:22,620
Really? Reset the floor. I don't think, I think I only had seven blue to start. Damn it. That's

1114
03:58:22,620 --> 03:58:35,020
very disappointing. You had eleven. Did Bulbman are immune to poison, fire, electricity, and water.

1115
03:58:35,020 --> 03:58:42,309
I had more blues at the start of this level? I don't think I did. Did I? Did they die? I had eleven

1116
03:58:42,309 --> 03:58:51,530
at subspace six. I did. I did? Oh, right. That's right. These two assholes. Right. Okay.

1117
03:58:52,489 --> 03:59:28,469
Um, god damn it, Andy. God damn it, Andy. What's that even mean? Oh, wait. I have to turn it back

1118
03:59:28,469 --> 03:59:55,659
on. It went into sleep mode. I love his face. Uh, what's wrong with my Wii? Uh-oh. Um, it just made the

1119
04:00:04,069 --> 04:00:27,959
I have to put my password in. Hold on. I forget my, I forget my password. I just put it into,

1120
04:00:27,959 --> 04:00:42,360
I don't know what it is. Did I get it right? Password is, okay, good. Oh, password is Hewl12345.

1121
04:00:43,319 --> 04:01:04,889
All right, we're good. Come on back. Press what? He's pretending. Hey, listen, listen. Did you hear it?

1122
04:01:07,530 --> 04:01:32,100
All right, let's come on back. Nintendo. I just love playing the Nintendo. I just love the Nintendo.

1123
04:01:32,100 --> 04:01:47,059
Let's see if I get absolutely destroyed this time. The two dumb spawns right next to me that just

1124
04:01:47,059 --> 04:01:58,889
start shooting rocks everywhere. What do we got? Wow, that's a way better room. This room doesn't

1125
04:01:58,889 --> 04:02:20,659
suck ass. Okay, let's take the purples. I want, I don't know why I want to do Sir Finley Murgleton

1126
04:02:20,659 --> 04:02:42,120
so bad right now. It's just grabbing a hold of me. I don't know why. I need fire to get rid of that.

1127
04:02:42,120 --> 04:02:51,700
Punch them. I could try the punch. Yeah, I'm not bringing anybody over there. I'm going to punch.

1128
04:02:58,219 --> 04:03:04,219
Oh my god, hit him. That would have been horrible. All right, everybody stay back. I'm going for the

1129
04:03:04,219 --> 04:03:29,370
punch. I just got stun locked. Olimar is a clown. Olimar is a fucking clown. What happened? Wait,

1130
04:03:29,370 --> 04:03:49,190
what happens? Oh, just take rid of this so I can get over here. I don't even know why these guys

1131
04:03:49,190 --> 04:03:55,909
are even spawning here. It's like where are you supposed to even go with this? My teeth. I'm just

1132
04:03:55,909 --> 04:04:24,389
talking through my teeth. Move. Shoot him. Why did you, one walked all the way over there. What

1133
04:04:24,389 --> 04:04:34,540
is wrong with you? Get out of the water. Get out of the water. Get out of the water. I fucking god

1134
04:04:34,540 --> 04:04:40,059
fucked this place. Fucked this place. Fuck this level. What the hell? Where are you supposed to

1135
04:04:40,059 --> 04:05:01,530
even go? Get out. Make them shoot each other. Yeah, and then one of them is going to fire one.

1136
04:05:02,489 --> 04:05:07,770
That was the dumbest thing I've ever seen in my life. I don't even know what happened. How

1137
04:05:07,770 --> 04:05:10,569
did that even happen? That was stupid. That was the dumbest fucking thing I've ever seen.

1138
04:05:26,120 --> 04:06:10,200
Look, it's a bulbus. All right, I got a bulbus. Can I do this with Louis? Okay, do we have enough

1139
04:06:10,200 --> 04:06:21,340
blue to do this? Okay, thank god. Let's go. I need red as well to get rid of the fire and the

1140
04:06:21,340 --> 04:07:09,940
bulbuses. Here we go. Well, I had to do that because they have to pull the, they're going

1141
04:07:09,940 --> 04:07:17,510
to walk through that. Okay, there's one more of these assholes over here. Oh, perfect.

1142
04:07:18,389 --> 04:07:37,590
Good ING. Good ING. Don't get on that with them. You're just going to die if you do that.

1143
04:07:38,149 --> 04:07:46,620
That's pretty good ING. Nice. All right, then we just gotta wait for them to be done.

1144
04:07:47,639 --> 04:07:53,909
In the meantime, what can I do? I get a meantime. Oh shit, hold on. In the meantime, I'm gonna make

1145
04:07:53,909 --> 04:08:16,379
this guy shoot himself. The chest piece. Nice. Pog. Okay, now get shot. How much is that worth?

1146
04:08:17,020 --> 04:08:50,899
80. Pretty good. Pretty cool. You can do it. Yeah. Okay, I just keep hearing this in my brain.

1147
04:08:51,700 --> 04:09:09,959
All right, blues, get back. I said blue. I don't want any white there. Blue. All right,

1148
04:09:09,959 --> 04:09:19,430
we should have enough to get the last piece. It's 10. All right, is there anything else in here?

1149
04:09:21,719 --> 04:09:32,229
What about up here? No, that is all that remains. You all right? All right, you're good.

1150
04:09:41,190 --> 04:09:46,389
Go in there with them. You guys just really like to put yourselves into danger, don't you?

1151
04:09:50,200 --> 04:09:55,239
And then I'll be able to take everybody up. So again, please confirm with me again. If I go

1152
04:09:55,239 --> 04:09:59,079
into here just as Louie, everybody comes with me. It doesn't matter if they're part of the crew or

1153
04:09:59,079 --> 04:10:22,969
not, right? Correct. Okay. Fantastic. Goldman are immune to everything. That's good because I'll be

1154
04:10:22,969 --> 04:10:35,340
sending them wherever they want to go next. Okay, we're good. Hold C. It's not healing.

1155
04:10:37,190 --> 04:11:00,200
Treasure's gone. Let's go. But lies deeper. This is level seven or eight. Olimar is dead.

1156
04:11:00,200 --> 04:11:20,040
He is. What do we got? What's over here? Nothing. Explore it. There's the way down.

1157
04:11:20,760 --> 04:11:33,530
Okay, it doesn't look too bad so far. Unless there's something in the ground. And there's

1158
04:11:34,649 --> 04:11:58,840
something wrong there. That's something fell from the ceiling. Come with me. Watch out. Watch out.

1159
04:11:58,840 --> 04:12:10,250
I'm very cautious about this. Okay. Yeah. It says stuff. Shit drops from the ceiling. Good to know.

1160
04:12:10,250 --> 04:12:27,659
Oh boy. Okay. What do we got over here? That's the way down. Watch it. Where's this treasure?

1161
04:12:27,659 --> 04:12:51,260
Down here? Where is this damn thing? Oh man. Oh, there's a white thing. Okay. I need to...

1162
04:12:51,260 --> 04:13:11,780
Who should I throw in here? Yellow? Probably yellow. Do not drop a meteor on me right here,

1163
04:13:11,780 --> 04:13:23,319
please. Don't drop a meteor here. Thank god. Okay. A couple of, a lot of big guys.

1164
04:13:35,690 --> 04:13:56,520
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

1165
04:14:08,729 --> 04:14:36,100
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Come back. Oh my God. He runs really fast. He's really fast.

1166
04:14:36,879 --> 04:14:48,819
Go back to sleep. Come on back here. Run away

1167
04:14:49,719 --> 04:15:11,500
Good. Okay. Now I'm ready. Let's get our

1168
04:15:12,059 --> 04:15:15,260
Something to dig up there, but I don't want to get killed by any explosions

1169
04:15:15,260 --> 04:15:20,840
I swear to God a meteor is gonna kill everybody aren't they?

1170
04:15:21,280 --> 04:15:39,409
I'm so afraid of a meteor just dropping right now. Please don't. What do you think Pikmin tastes like Jerma? Um, probably acidic

1171
04:15:40,239 --> 04:15:53,440
Acid they're probably very at like they probably tastes like very acidic

1172
04:15:53,639 --> 04:15:56,200
You know the sour

1173
04:15:56,440 --> 04:15:58,739
All right, you know what a sour patch kid tastes like?

1174
04:15:58,860 --> 04:16:06,790
Okay. Now, do you know what you know? Okay, you know when lightning strikes and you get that smell outside kind of smells like ozone

1175
04:16:06,790 --> 04:16:10,190
I feel like it's like a mix of sour patch kids and ozone

1176
04:16:23,840 --> 04:16:27,760
It's really funny when people say that what are you talking about smelling ozone?

1177
04:16:28,319 --> 04:16:32,979
That's what you smell when it's like a when a thunderstorm is happening

1178
04:16:32,979 --> 04:16:37,139
It is like a lightning and that like electricity kind of smell that like rain lightning kind of smell that's ozone

1179
04:16:37,700 --> 04:16:43,719
Ozone and like bacteria and stuff. That's correct. I thought I was the stupid one. What are you talking about?

1180
04:16:44,399 --> 04:16:50,010
Look it up right now. Don't look it up right now. Look it up right now

1181
04:16:50,690 --> 04:17:03,500
You're a bozo and a yo-yo nice, but if he's right, yeah, I know

1182
04:17:05,399 --> 04:17:07,399
That's it you're spelling ozone

1183
04:17:07,420 --> 04:17:15,459
See all those question marks that was spammed when I first said that and now all of them have been educated

1184
04:17:16,260 --> 04:17:27,129
Smells like ozone in here. Um, I would not that that's not good for you

1185
04:17:27,469 --> 04:17:31,790
You don't want to be breathing in ozone that a much that's not good. I

1186
04:17:32,350 --> 04:17:39,590
Was the uh, how do I go deeper?

Yeah, you really actually like ozone's not good for you like to breathe in just you shouldn't be

1188
04:17:54,100 --> 04:18:00,899
All right level eight. I'm still hearing that god-awful noise

1189
04:18:01,639 --> 04:18:14,989

Who's eating who's eating

04:18:49,879 --> 04:19:20,440
What was that? Oh my god, they're fucking muppet frogs. What happened? I don't even know what I'm able to add

1209
04:22:44,799 --> 04:22:55,090
I got a little shoe. That was terrifying with the little frog people

1210
04:22:55,629 --> 04:22:58,639
How would her stink limits?

1211
04:23:00,909 --> 04:23:20,799
Stench must be emanating from that object. Don't why are you still here? Did you actually eat one? You fucker?

1212
04:23:21,319 --> 04:23:30,629
There's still any alive. I'm so scared that they get I keep eating. I gotta follow these guys back cuz this is gonna be bad

1213
04:23:31,270 --> 04:23:33,569
There's definitely a couple that I didn't kill

1214
04:23:33,850 --> 04:23:57,159
Maybe not. All right, I think we're good. Hurry up. Well, that could have gone way worse. I think that's a success

1215
04:23:57,159 --> 04:23:59,159
That's a six. That's a successful cave

1216
04:23:59,680 --> 04:24:06,479
completion

1217
04:24:06,479 --> 04:24:16,280
This object is pockets of air under its surface. It is perfect for the boots. I am making

1218
04:24:17,000 --> 04:24:18,920
more run speed

1219
04:24:18,920 --> 04:24:21,680
rush boots

1220
04:24:21,680 --> 04:24:26,360
These nullify wind resistance by circulating air beneath the souls, okay

1221
04:24:27,000 --> 04:24:32,319
You'll move faster and you'll no longer be blown away by puffy blow hogs. Oh cool

1222
04:24:32,959 --> 04:24:41,340
It's still treasure here. No, that's not damn it

1223
04:24:43,129 --> 04:24:50,549
Very cool. That is it. Let's get out of here

1224
04:24:51,149 --> 04:24:57,719
Everyone's eating right?

1225
04:24:57,719 --> 04:25:04,479
It's free food you the cave at the far side of the perplexing pool

1226
04:25:04,479 --> 04:25:12,090
It's a fan favorite a but the far side of the perplexing pool. Well, let's see, huh?

1227
04:25:13,899 --> 04:25:33,309
Nothing else here. Let's go. There's the cave. That's yeah. That's a cave. I want to do. Oh, no my little bulb friends

1228
04:25:33,309 --> 04:25:38,190
That's unfortunate

1229
04:25:38,190 --> 04:25:56,920
4,000 they should be able to come with me. That's not fair. It's time. Do I have left in the day? Oh

1230
04:26:05,959 --> 04:26:17,239
All of Mars back. Oh, no, you're not. He's not doing that. Well, okay. Uh, I saw almost a whole day

1231
04:26:17,879 --> 04:26:38,719
What do I want to do? I need more blue bad. I guess we'll go get some red and finish it up with yellow

1232
04:26:39,239 --> 04:26:49,879
That's I don't we don't need a hundred. It's fine. We already went that way this way

1233
04:26:49,959 --> 04:26:56,889
There was another cave over here when they're I swear to God doesn't yeah, that's what the cave over here

1234
04:26:56,889 --> 04:27:02,170

1235
04:27:04,000 --> 04:27:14,079
Very all of our we're not getting stuck, right? Okay. Have a burial for all of them

1236
04:27:14,639 --> 04:27:26,459
Come on, you can do it guys. Come on get over here. You're so slow

1237
04:27:26,979 --> 04:27:37,969

How many people do I I don't very many anything dangerous in the way or can they bring it back? What is it?

1241
04:28:20,979 --> 04:28:27,010
Pineapple artichoke. All right, bring the artichoke back

1242
04:28:27,569 --> 04:28:45,360
All right. There was I gotta be careful here. I have somebody slow Pikmin. There's a cave up this way

1243
04:28:45,360 --> 04:28:51,549
I haven't gone. Hold on. I completed that one. I completed that one, too. Oh

1244
04:28:52,899 --> 04:28:57,069
Sure, I think I did everything here. Did I complete the first actual level?

1245
04:28:57,430 --> 04:29:05,780
I think it's done. Wait, what about did I go in this one? No, I didn't do this one

1246
04:29:05,780 --> 04:29:21,040
I wonder if I should just go in here. No, no, no with I don't have Olimar

1247
04:29:21,040 --> 04:29:47,139
I think it's gonna end the day. I might be a coward but does that make me a coward arm for some Pikmin?

1248
04:29:47,379 --> 04:29:51,979
Yeah, that's true. All right, we're gonna kill we're gonna take we're gonna kill everything over here

04:31:09,290 --> 04:31:19,579

Pick that up bring it back to blue

1259
04:31:22,459 --> 04:31:31,020

1260
04:31:31,020 --> 04:31:41,520

1263
04:32:11,059 --> 04:32:17,329
Why is this red? I'm very upset with the red Pikmin right now

1264
04:32:17,329 --> 04:32:19,329
They're messing this whole thing up

1265
04:32:19,370 --> 04:33:00,950
Nobody touched that fucking thing. How many do I need to over there over there?

1266

Okay, purple help. Wait, I need a blue and then I need a blue over there

1267
04:33:22,970 --> 04:33:34,849
Okay blue and then I need another blue from here. That's okay. That doesn't matter. You can take yellow from that

1269
04:33:50,840 --> 04:33:57,240

There's too many people

1274
04:34:52,009 --> 04:34:56,599
Please don't go this way. Why are you going over?

1275
04:34:57,200 --> 04:35:20,669
What happened to the other guys with the coins? They're already good. They went the long way. Did they really?

1276
04:35:21,229 --> 04:35:25,700
Of course they did. I'm surprised they didn't get eaten

1277
04:35:29,959 --> 04:35:35,200
Back here

1278
04:35:35,240 --> 04:35:42,669
Why did they go this way and you're gonna run right into a bunch of red Pikmin and it's gonna fuck everything up

1279
04:35:42,689 --> 04:35:44,689
Just everybody stay back and stay here

1280
04:35:45,250 --> 04:36:17,340
Why are they bringing go crush his head? Oh, no, just get it. Oh my god

1281
04:36:17,340 --> 04:36:45,159
He blew up into blue. I'll touch that. I don't care who gets them. Just bring him in. What about all of our?

1282
04:36:45,360 --> 04:36:53,169
Wait, what about all of them are I love how they go? Look at how long that's such a long way

1283
04:36:53,169 --> 04:36:57,439
Why'd they go that way you have to leave them?

1284
04:36:59,869 --> 04:37:02,360
98 99 98 99

1285
04:37:03,439 --> 04:37:26,909
100 you're dead. Okay, that's close

1286
04:37:36,240 --> 04:38:04,889
It's really fun this fun game don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't I'm gonna pee one more time

1287
04:38:05,250 --> 04:39:45,810
And we will continue. I'll be right back. So we're probably gonna call it here in the next 30 minutes or so

1288
04:39:45,849 --> 04:39:55,610
30 40 minutes, maybe something like that. I'll be enough to do another day. I like this game though

1289
04:39:55,610 --> 04:39:56,770
I thought I'm gonna beat this game

1290
04:39:56,770 --> 04:40:03,200
I think I'm pretty positive about that one or at least the I'll stream this at least one more time

1291
04:40:03,200 --> 04:40:12,959
I really like it. They were left to starve

1292
04:40:16,319 --> 04:40:25,950
It all you fan art trends in one image minus that weird German dude, you're close

1293
04:40:25,950 --> 04:40:31,319
I thought when I get to the end of the dead

1294
04:40:31,319 --> 04:40:46,090
I was like just not even like 60% of the way through the game. Well, let's go

1295
04:40:50,450 --> 04:40:52,369
when you're down

1296
04:40:52,409 --> 04:40:58,409
And I think my whatever at eight thousand

1297
04:40:59,400 --> 04:41:01,400
Everything has been done here besides as a cave there

1298
04:41:01,840 --> 04:41:07,689
Where if I what am I not done? There's two things I haven't perplexing pool

1300
04:41:16,889 --> 04:41:27,099
Well, maybe I'll just play I'll play it one more time if I don't beat it tonight, then we'll just do it again

1301
04:41:27,619 --> 04:41:31,380

1307
04:42:17,720 --> 04:42:22,950
What is this cave?

04:48:47,169 --> 04:48:49,349
paradoxical enigma

1341
04:48:55,650 --> 04:48:57,130
Emergency emergency

04:49:42,159 --> 04:50:04,659
Level three. I missed a purple flower. Oh fuck. Oh well. I'm practicing cat boy. That's supposed to be a Pikmin

1348
04:50:05,259 --> 04:50:09,360
That's a bad place to start

1349
04:50:10,169 --> 04:50:37,139
I need uh, that's electric, right? Well didn't do very good job separating. Get over here. I'm gonna here we go

1350
04:50:38,639 --> 04:50:40,639
How did red even get over here?

1351
04:50:40,799 --> 04:50:45,240
Alright, here we go

1352
04:50:45,240 --> 04:50:53,479
Put him down put him down

1353
04:50:53,880 --> 04:51:33,419
Start killing this guy's the biggest pain in the ass. He's gotta go first kill them all. Yep. That's the plan. Yep. That's we mode

1354
04:51:37,369 --> 04:51:40,150
I'm so like bitter and awful like what the hell

1355
04:51:41,130 --> 04:51:43,939
What the why?

1356
04:51:43,939 --> 04:52:08,819
There's the um, there's a nectar. Oh, there it is. Okay again. Nice. We mode. Why is it doing that?

1357
04:52:08,819 --> 04:52:18,540
I never played Pikmin. I don't really understand what's going on. Can you explain it? Sure

1358
04:52:19,659 --> 04:52:21,459
So I am a guy

1359
04:52:21,459 --> 04:52:27,020
That landed on a planet and there's these little creatures little alien bug things called Pikmin

1360
04:52:27,380 --> 04:52:33,540
They're different colors and the different colors are different things. So yellow is electric red is fire blue is water

1361
04:52:34,060 --> 04:52:37,020
white is gas purple is super strength and

1362
04:52:38,779 --> 04:52:40,299
That's it and

1363
04:52:40,299 --> 04:52:44,060
You have to pick them you have to you have to take them and have them do various tasks

1364
04:52:44,419 --> 04:52:48,139
They have to pick up stuff. You have to get treasure

1365
04:52:48,720 --> 04:52:52,520
You have to go deep into caves and find stuff

1366
04:52:53,080 --> 04:52:55,400
It's pretty cool

1367
04:52:55,400 --> 04:53:07,790
Now, hopefully they don't okay. This is bad. And then at its timed at the end of every day

1368
04:53:09,099 --> 04:53:27,330
You have to run away because the monsters will come and eat you and it's fun to collect stuff you run around you just collect things

1369
04:53:35,049 --> 04:53:37,130
What am I doing that for? Oh, there's an egg in there. Okay. Yeah

1370
04:53:37,849 --> 04:53:57,330
Everybody get that bring it back to the base and then crack that away. I gotta kill everything in here first

1371
04:53:57,330 --> 04:54:13,000
There's a lot of treasure in this one. There's like five six hundred bucks worth of stuff in here. I'll let him slam

1372
04:54:15,009 --> 04:54:23,560
And what's that work a hundred?

1373
04:54:24,560 --> 04:54:34,979

Everybody come up. It's time to slam now. We got the whole world watching now. Welcome to the space jam

1375
04:54:43,020 --> 04:54:45,020

1377
04:54:56,840 --> 04:54:58,639
Are they actually gonna make it?

1378
04:54:58,639 --> 04:55:10,040
Why is that movie vaporware? I feel like a space jam to coming out in like 2013

1379
04:55:10,680 --> 04:55:21,799

That's it right and I break that egg nice water chestnuts

1386
04:56:46,970 --> 04:56:53,009
Something really funny about water chestnuts. I was gonna make a tweet two days ago talking about how much I loved water chestnuts

1387
04:56:53,009 --> 04:56:57,560
And I only eat them like once a year. I

1388
04:56:58,479 --> 04:57:05,880
Was gonna tweet about my absolute love for water chestnuts. How come they're not in more stuff. I

1389
04:57:06,360 --> 04:57:12,790
Love the texture. I love the way they feel. I love the sound they make too

1390
04:57:13,270 --> 04:57:16,349
When you bite into a water chestnut, it makes this incredible noise

1391
04:57:16,709 --> 04:57:18,709
It's just like

1392
04:57:18,790 --> 04:57:27,900
It's amazing water chestnuts are gross

1393
04:57:28,500 --> 04:57:34,720
They are not I'm sorry. You're you've lost your mind

1394
04:57:35,279 --> 04:57:48,159
They're wonderful. They have that amazing texture to them. Oh, I can feel it right now like that

1395
04:57:49,040 --> 04:57:57,020
That's it. Let's go Luigi's Mansion

1396

1397
04:58:16,479 --> 04:58:29,119
All right, this is still not the last floor. Oh, I thought that was my phone ringing

05:05:30,610 --> 05:05:40,240
Final floor here we go. Is there a boss on every final floor of a cave or no?

1439
05:05:47,099 --> 05:06:13,680
Something's over here. Hmm. Where is it? I wanted the nectar. I just wanted the nectar. Do we have everybody?

1440
05:06:14,400 --> 05:06:26,020
Alright, what does he do? I'm assuming gonna grab him right in the belly. I missed run

1441
05:06:38,619 --> 05:06:52,349
There yeah, you gotta grab him the stock that's kind of hard to grab back up

1442
05:06:59,290 --> 05:07:02,090
Shit

1443
05:07:02,610 --> 05:07:09,490

Got it, and he dropped a key a key to what door

1446
05:07:42,439 --> 05:07:49,970
Sweet victory that giant insects body has crumbled to dust. I'm quite relieved to know I won't have to store such an enormous bug

1447
05:07:51,750 --> 05:07:55,270
Analyzing soil samples anomaly detected. What's that glittering widget?

1448
05:07:55,950 --> 05:08:05,599
That's a little Mario key. We're gonna get it. There's another treasure over here somewhere. I could dig it out

1449
05:08:06,119 --> 05:08:10,860
Take up here. Maybe

1450
05:08:10,860 --> 05:08:20,700

1451
05:08:33,150 --> 05:08:43,080
$100 my wrists are my elbows are so red familiar. I'll combine it with the president's parallel dimension controller. What does it do?

1452
05:08:43,799 --> 05:08:47,069
massive dimensional shift at a distant location

1453
05:08:48,650 --> 05:08:51,189
Receiving a message from a far-flung dimension

1454
05:08:51,889 --> 05:08:59,680
Challenge mode can now be accessed from the title screen. It appears to be total gibberish. Oh

1455
05:09:00,360 --> 05:09:16,200
New game mode. I will name this worthless device the key. We're ready to get up there and help dig

Be useful for god's sakes. Oh, it's a diamond nice now. There's is that in it's probably it

1458
05:10:04,250 --> 05:10:07,450
Let's escape. That's fun. I

05:10:07,729 --> 05:10:16,630
Made up with almost a thousand bucks

1460
05:10:26,610 --> 05:10:27,810
Cool

1461
05:10:27,810 --> 05:10:43,330
Think I still have a little bit of a day left here. I do I have a whole day

1462
05:10:43,729 --> 05:10:53,139
So I've got a whole day left. Is there anything I can let me just look around for hidden stuff

1463
05:10:53,560 --> 05:11:14,270
Do I need blue go to the castle or the submerged castle? Oh, let's see if I can find it

1464
05:11:15,979 --> 05:11:21,049
submerged castle they don't this way

1465
05:11:27,700 --> 05:11:38,900
I'm gonna say I just gonna take blue everybody hang out here. Well, you know, just kill these guys first

1466

We already died. All right blue. What's over here any treasures?

1467
05:11:59,270 --> 05:12:04,040
Electricity, how do I get over that? I do have to throw them from here. How would I do that?

1468
05:12:04,560 --> 05:12:23,340
Stop doing that. How do I get electric? I've got to drain this. Oh, what is that? Is that a treasure?

1469
05:12:24,020 --> 05:12:29,200
It's what is that a stingray or a treasure? I don't know what that is

1470
05:12:29,720 --> 05:12:47,580
Guys, you didn't walk up here with us

1471
05:12:48,000 --> 05:12:55,599
Really? I get over here

1472
05:13:01,479 --> 05:13:09,130
Help out. This is why I didn't bring anybody but blue. This was been a disaster. Oh

1473
05:13:14,939 --> 05:13:16,540
Electric can take that down

1474
05:13:16,540 --> 05:13:29,380
Perfect. Cool. All right, let's go get yellow. This is gonna be really hard to bring everybody over here

1475
05:13:40,959 --> 05:13:42,560
Missing a lot of people

1476
05:13:42,560 --> 05:14:07,189
Well, let's hope I don't get every yellow killed. Stay away from us. No, come back. Come on. Come on. Come on, please

1477
05:14:07,830 --> 05:14:10,880
You can make it you can make it you can make it you can make it you can make it

1478
05:14:11,340 --> 05:14:20,369
Are you supposed to fucking do that? How are you supposed to actually do that? They're so stupid

1479
05:14:20,889 --> 05:14:23,090
They just run randomly in random directions

1480
05:14:23,689 --> 05:14:26,180
It's so dumb. It's not even possible

1481
05:14:27,380 --> 05:14:45,720
Get over there. Oh my fucking god. You are so stupid. I hate you. The yellow ones are the worst

1482
05:14:46,319 --> 05:15:58,799
They're stupider than the red ones and they're slow. Get over here. I'm fucking actually pissed. Yes

1483
05:15:58,799 --> 05:16:02,009
I killed like 30

1484
05:16:02,689 --> 05:16:31,720
Yellow Pikmin I killed 30 of them. It was horrible and I'm pissed off about it. What is over here?

1485
05:16:32,200 --> 05:16:52,229
Um, I can only go in there with blue. This is a blue only level. Oh shit. Well, we'll be doing that next time

1486
05:16:52,830 --> 05:17:02,819

05:17:07,669 --> 05:17:11,409

1488
05:17:11,830 --> 05:17:33,979
Is there any just treasure chest in the hair down here or anything on the ledge? What about it?

1489
05:17:34,340 --> 05:18:31,919
Well this thing I think it has killed somebody you kidding me. You did it. All right good for you

You've been caught. I thought that was a cave to face the dangers ahead

1496
05:20:33,549 --> 05:20:36,349
You must be free of the shackles of a boss worker relationship

I'll probably have some more updates for you guys

1517
05:24:57,700 --> 05:25:05,409
Thursday's plan is we're gonna beat Pikmin and then depending that probably is only gonna take like another hour or two

1518
05:25:05,930 --> 05:25:07,169
Maybe

1519
05:25:07,169 --> 05:25:14,209
We'll move on to something else after Pikmin. That's the plan

1520
05:25:14,209 --> 05:25:21,849
I am have to assume that to get to 10,000 and to do some of the late game stuff

1521
05:25:22,090 --> 05:25:29,099
Probably another couple hours two three hours, and who knows maybe it just we finish Pikmin and do a whole stream on it

1522
05:25:29,099 --> 05:25:37,319
We'll see it's really fun. I'm really into it
