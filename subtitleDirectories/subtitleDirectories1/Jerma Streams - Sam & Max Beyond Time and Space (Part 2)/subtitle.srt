1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:09,259
Hello everybody, or I'm dropping a lot of frames in the very beginning here.

2
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:15,339
Uh oh, this is a bad sign. Hopefully it situates itself

3
00:00:15,339 --> 00:00:28,170
so we can stream a video game. Oof. Oof. Come on, pull it through here, man.

4
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:40,310
Pull it through. You can do it. Well, at least I hope so.

5
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:47,829
But, hello. If we're able to stream today, which we should be, hopefully.

6
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:53,450
Sam and Max, hope you're having a good day. And you all as well. I mean, not

7
00:00:53,450 --> 00:01:00,579
just Sam and Max. I hope they have a great time on stream today.

8
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:05,260
Why are all the planets orbiting the moon? Uh,

9
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:10,379
because that's what it looks like through a telescope.

10
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:17,269
I don't, this, oh by the way, probably gonna get this remade as well.

11
00:01:17,269 --> 00:01:24,099
Gonna add some planets, change it up a little bit.

12
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:33,670
You thought the title said what? Why? It's not moon.

13
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:37,859
That is the moon. But, uh, as of tomorrow,

14
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:41,670
I'll give you an internet update here. I've been told that

15
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,390
they're going to try to fix it tomorrow. Somewhere in the plant, who knows what

16
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:51,349
they're gonna do. But hopefully this is situated as of

17
00:01:51,349 --> 00:01:54,760
tomorrow, or the next day. I'm gonna give them a couple days to

18
00:01:54,760 --> 00:02:01,609
figure it out. But, yep, we're gonna do Sam and Max. We are at

19
00:02:01,609 --> 00:02:06,390
the point in Sam and Max, episode three, season two.

20
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,789
Episode four, maybe. We'll do the two episodes, see where we're at.

21
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:15,750
Starting early because I have to go get Kim later.

22
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:26,039
So I want to be able to do that. Starting an hour or two early.

23
00:02:26,039 --> 00:03:38,229
Give me one second, and we'll get started. All right,

24
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:44,300
let me move this out of the way. Man, I've dropped 20% of every frame

25
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:49,689
in five minutes. Fuck, that's not good.

26
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:55,580
That's actually a very, very bad sign to start the stream.

27
00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:13,460
Not good. Not good at all. Give me, let's just hang out for a

28
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:16,259
minute. Because if this continues like this, I

29
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:24,339
might have to change my plan on the fly here. It wasn't this bad

30
00:04:24,339 --> 00:04:29,509
yesterday, not even close. Well the day before that. But this

31
00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:42,379
is like actually unbearable.

32
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:48,259
What mouse and keyboard do I use? I use an Amazon Basics keyboard.

33
00:04:48,259 --> 00:05:00,779
And, that's true, I actually do. And a Razer Deathadder.

34
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:09,079
What a gamer. Yeah, Razer Deathadder and an Amazon Basics.

35
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:14,519
Well we're gonna, we're gonna try. Hopefully this

36
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:18,949
kind of gets over it in the next like 20 minutes or so.

37
00:05:18,949 --> 00:05:21,990
If not then I have to change plans. We're gonna do something else because I

38
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:25,509
don't want to be dropping 20% of all my frames and try to

39
00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:28,230
play something. But we'll, let's go. Let's give it a

40
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:38,519
try. Hopefully it fixes itself. Anyways, let's get over here.

41
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:54,300
Ay, ay, ay. Just calm down Jeremy. You just have to just relax.

42
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:59,350
Just relax. You don't have to, don't get angry. Don't start off in a bad

43
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:02,470
mood. Just relax. Breathe in, breathe out.

44
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:11,990
Let's breathe in. Let's do it together. And then breathe in.

45
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:16,139
I think collectively if we all do this at the same time, then it'll be

46
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:20,339
maybe I'll get even more calm down, you know.

47
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:25,129
If there's like 1200 people all doing this at the same time,

48
00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:30,709
it's gonna affect me. I'm gonna get all of your energies

49
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:33,589
and I won't elevate, I'm not gonna elevate my voice today. We're gonna

50
00:06:33,589 --> 00:06:38,889
stay silent like this. All right, let me

51
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:42,250
restart because with this game, as you know, it

52
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:46,019
kind of just jumps right into it. Again, this is season two, episode

53
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:49,750
three. And I would like to start a new game.

54
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:53,779
Keep doing what you're doing, everybody. Keep like breathing in and

55
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:57,939
breathing out slowly because it like fixed the internet.

56
00:06:57,939 --> 00:07:01,689
It definitely didn't, but you know. Here we go.

57
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:17,319
You have interfered with my plans for the last time, Sam and Ma.

58
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:21,240
Taking your- I did already see this. You'll satisfy my dark masters once

59
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,240
and for all. And then I will use my army of the undead to take

60
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,160
over the world.

61
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:35,480
Damn you, JÃ¼rgen! I never thought he'd go for the cheesy evil laugh.

62
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:40,279
Insolent to the last. No matter. Oh, we shall see how you make me

63
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:45,560
some ice cracks after you are dead. Oh, looks like this is it, little buddy.

64
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,600
My whole life is flashing before my eyes. I wondered why I left my wallet.

65
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,639
I can't even remember how we got here. Come on, Max.

66
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,879
Remember, we were back in the office just back from Easter Island.

67
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:01,160
Wait, wait. Do the whole thing with the music and all that.

68
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:08,339
Oh, please shoot in the intro. Yeah, don't worry. I will. I'm gonna

69
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:26,149
get them all. Here we go. We can't- Dude, I need

70
00:08:26,149 --> 00:08:31,689
to play some more of these types of games.

71
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:36,299
I gotta get some more, like, mouse shooters. I feel like I'm pretty good at

72
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:43,480
them. Doesn't being High Priest of Easter Island

73
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,320
and President violate the separation of church and state?

74
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:59,669
Blasphemy! Hitler is giving me a religious vision!

75
00:08:59,669 --> 00:09:10,220
He's turning into Beavis. He's turning into, like, a corn holio.

76
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:21,990
Hey, not bad. Hello, Commissioner?

77
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:32,090
Wait, what? Not making so much noise? Speak up, Commissioner. I can't hear you.

78
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:35,289
We're having a zombie attack. What's that, Commissioner?

79
00:09:35,289 --> 00:09:39,450
Zombie attacks? Jen running George A. Romero in a baby doll t-shirt outside

80
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:42,009
the food court with a $43 gift certificate.

81
00:09:42,009 --> 00:09:45,450
We're on the case. The Commissioner says zombie attacks are popping up all

82
00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:48,889
over the world. Is he washing his armpits? Boils on the decaying flesh of,

83
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:54,330
well, a zombie. Wait, who's attacking? They're coming from some place called

84
00:09:54,330 --> 00:10:00,730
the Zombie Factory. Ha ha, zombies! Zombie attacks! You wander around aimlessly

85
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:03,929
and see what you can turn up. Meanwhile, I'll actually figure out

86
00:10:03,929 --> 00:10:07,610
where they're coming from. One step ahead of you!

87
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:14,169
All right, so, Salmon Max. Let's increase the volume a little bit

88
00:10:14,169 --> 00:10:19,110
to get that authentic Salmon Max experience.

89
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:24,440
Welcome, everybody. That was the opening cut scene. Zombie apocalypse.

90
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:33,240
Incoming. See, I think the internet has settled.

91
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,519
It's still kind of not good, but this guy's still in here.

92
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:45,909
He's been in here for like three weeks. Hey, Leonard.

93
00:10:45,909 --> 00:10:50,149
Is there any lore? Do we feed this guy? Does he eat?

94
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:57,350
Or does Jimmy? I think I hear a tiny tumbleweed blowing by your side. No, no, he's still

95
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:00,070
alive. Yeah, but like, we have to feed him. We can't just like

96
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:06,169
let him die in there. All right. I just want to look around

97
00:11:06,169 --> 00:11:08,169
the office a little bit. It's been a while. We got

98
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:11,210
Melee Earhart sure screamed bloody blue murder when we yanked her chair out

99
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:16,340
from under her. She's a baby. He uses photosynthesis.

100
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:19,940
Someone's setting up thousands of dominoes across the street.

101
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:23,059
Talk about way too much time on your hands. Says the guy

102
00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:26,899
watching someone set up thousands of dominoes.

103
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:30,100
Should I do that? I'm doing that one day. All right, I'm doing that like

104
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:36,500
soon. I'm doing that as soon as fucking possible.

105
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,460
I'm gonna do a full domino setup when I'm gonna like

106
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:51,690
set a ball up and knock him down somewhere. Yeah.

107
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:56,299
Yeah, we are. I'm doing a full domino. Okay, they're actually, this is a zombie

108
00:11:56,299 --> 00:12:01,320
puzzle. All right. Well, what do you, Jimmy,

109
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,940
what's going on here? What do you think?

110
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:08,460
The rats have set up their own little casino.

111
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:12,700
I want to show them a new sleeper hole I learned. The boss is busy.

112
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,220
He can't be too busy for us. We're the ones who gave him his big break.

113
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:19,419
Not to mention various smaller fractures and sprains. That's legitimately

114
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:25,100
the only thing worse than another nintendo labo stream.

115
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:31,610
Not if I, not if I hire like five people to help me do it, you know?

116
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:38,299
Not if I hired like five people and we make a huge one.

117
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:43,340
Clowns. Is there anything about the zombie factory?

118
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:48,059
Nope. We're screwed, Sam. That rat was our only lead.

119
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:51,100
Next labo stream confirmed. All right, can we talk to the zombies? Beat it,

120
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:58,360
deadbeat. Roll again.

121
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:08,149
All right, what about this giant stein? So the zombies drink beer. Flu, perhaps?

122
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:11,929
Let's press on. All right, so they drink, so they're not actually zombies.

123
00:13:11,929 --> 00:13:16,649
They're just like drunk? The zombies beer stein.

124
00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:19,850
Are they, are these just like really drunk people?

125
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:25,179
All right, what do I think down here? Let's start all the way. Zombies eat for free

126
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:31,509
here. Let's check this out. He was the

127
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:36,309
only woman I ever loved. Make a Rube Goldberg machine.

128
00:13:36,309 --> 00:13:39,990
Yeah, maybe you should talk about this with your therapist.

129
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:43,350
She was my therapist. I need to hire like an

130
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:46,789
engineer to be able to do that. Lamont and Wallace, you're here.

131
00:13:46,789 --> 00:13:51,509
Sam and Max, actually. Whatever, your friend here is driving me crazy.

132
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:57,750
Take him off my hands, would you? What's wrong with Lincoln?

133
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:01,429
Lincoln, what's, what's going on? What's going on? I'm shaking, Abraham.

134
00:14:01,429 --> 00:14:09,240
She's gone. Left me. Uh, you're talking about Sybil's gone?

135
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,840
Sybil! Yeah, yeah. Of course she left you.

136
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,720
She dumped you like yesterday's breakfast when she caught you macking

137
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,000
on the moai heads. I was sure it was just one of her

138
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,299
moods. Uh, have you heard anything about a

139
00:14:23,299 --> 00:14:27,460
zombie factory? Do you mean like a factory that comes to life after it's

140
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:30,179
been shut down, cranking out products in a hideous

141
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:33,860
parody of actual production, destroying other factories it comes into contact

142
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,340
with? No, that's not what we're looking for.

143
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:41,129
But I wish we were. Uh, do you know anything about zombies? What do you know

144
00:14:41,129 --> 00:14:45,690
about zombies? Pests, uligans, they always gather

145
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:51,210
outside the memorial with their million zombie rallies and groanings.

146
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:56,919
Always playing that awful music they listen to.

147
00:14:56,919 --> 00:15:00,120
All right, well how do you stop a zombie? How do you stop a zombie?

148
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,039
Beats me. Just between the three of us. I'm pretty hopeless at anything

149
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:14,019
except making speeches. Okay. What? That doesn't sound right.

150
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:17,379
Let's do all dialogue options. Take it like a man. Think of all the

151
00:15:17,379 --> 00:15:22,889
advantages of being single. Like what? Cox Jupiter. Yeah, this is

152
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:27,450
really bad. I'm so desperately trying to swallow

153
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:34,789
my rage right now. You have no idea. If the webcam was on, I keep looking

154
00:15:34,789 --> 00:15:36,549
over here and seeing it go down to like

155
00:15:36,549 --> 00:15:40,649
zero and I like if their webcam was on you would see like

156
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:53,690
like this. Ready? This is what I'm doing. Ready? Look at this. Every like

157
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:56,090
like minute or two uh this is what you this is what I do. Like I'm looking

158
00:15:56,090 --> 00:16:05,110
over here I'm like trying to pay attention and I look over and I go

159
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:09,190
it happens like every 30 seconds. I gotta fucking like just

160
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:14,470
chill. I'm so fucking like tortured right now. I am

161
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:19,860
being dying tortured. I look like Abraham Lincoln.

162
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:38,549
What?

163
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:47,940
That's fine. That's fine with me. Hey Kazzy, thanks for the five community subs.

164
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:53,500
He is a lot taller than I am but thank you Kazzy.

165
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,860
He's like seven feet tall. You can do what you want when you want.

166
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:02,419
You answer to nobody and nobody cares if you die.

167
00:17:02,419 --> 00:17:05,779
Play the feeling. You can meet lots of new people and have a never-ending

168
00:17:05,779 --> 00:17:08,980
string of shallow unfulfilling encounters. Grow a

169
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:19,609
Lincoln beard for next stream. I don't think I could do that.

170
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:22,890
I don't think this is helping. We seem to be working at cross purposes Max.

171
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:26,809
Maybe but this way I get to annoy two people at once.

172
00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:30,950
Do it. I can't grow a beard. Don't you guys understand?

173
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:34,630
Keep a stiff hairless upper lip Abe. Soup store thanks to the five community

174
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:38,809
subs. Thank you soup store. Back to back five community sub drops

175
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:46,440
here. Thanks a lot guys. Any items in here? Dude you know what

176
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,349
actually might be causing this internet problem here? And that always

177
00:17:51,349 --> 00:17:55,109
seems to correlate with it. Is when we get these crazy fucking

178
00:17:55,109 --> 00:18:00,180
wins. That's definitely what it is. It's just

179
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,980
like doing damage to something and then they gotta fix it. There's like

180
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:10,380
crazy wins. You probably hear it. Yeah whatever. I'm not gonna let it

181
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:17,670
bother me. Let's just play. I turn on the webcam and I'm like

182
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:23,990
hanging onto a pole sideways. Help! Finally I have the wherewithal to

183
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:31,339
get that prepared. Hiya cops. Do you know?

184
00:18:31,339 --> 00:18:34,779
Are you tired of paying a lot for your internet service?

185
00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:38,779
What? Yeah actually I am. Well those days are over.

186
00:18:38,779 --> 00:18:41,500
Welcome to a new type of internet access.

187
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:46,619
S.O.L. So simple even a zombie could use it.

188
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:53,160
Yeah it's pretty cool. Do you know anything about it?

189
00:18:53,960 --> 00:19:00,440
Processing. We have gathered extensive marketing data on zombies.

190
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,920
Zombies need an easier less expensive way to access the internet.

191
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:09,319
That's why we developed Stuttgart online for the greatest concentration of

192
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:13,240
newly active zombies. Stuttgart Germany.

193
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,599
You've unlocked a new area. What'd he say that for?

194
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:21,960
We do not know. He has been like this ever since the accident.

195
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,400
Max when I'm done yammering remind me we gotta drive to Stuttgart.

196
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:30,359
Quick like a zombie. Drive to Stuttgart. Right forgot it already.

197
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:34,119
Okay so you're selling the internet to zombies.

198
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:38,279
Not just the internet but much much more.

199
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:41,559
From trivia to music, lifestyles to death styles,

200
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:46,200
and inventive new recipes for brains. Stuttgart online is the premier online.

201
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,400
Dude that's where the best internet is. What am I thinking? I gotta move to

202
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:54,940
Stuttgart. Everyone move to EU. Move to EU. I keep

203
00:19:54,940 --> 00:20:01,019
hearing it. All right let's go. Stuttgart.

204
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:06,700
Didn't we destroy the internet? Luckily Elgor was able to recreate the

205
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:11,099
internet from his original plans. What's on the internet that would

206
00:20:11,099 --> 00:20:14,220
interest a droning glassy eyed zombie anyway?

207
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:20,630
Elgor recreated the internet in his own image.

208
00:20:20,869 --> 00:20:23,509
What is so great about Stuttgart online?

209
00:20:23,509 --> 00:20:26,789
It's the fun easy to use online experience for

210
00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:34,170
zombies and zombies at heart. Okay what about the car? We just want to

211
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:38,490
pimp our car. We no longer offer car upgrades.

212
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:42,089
Our income has been lower than previously forecast.

213
00:20:42,089 --> 00:20:46,250
But this neighborhood has the highest accident rate in five states.

214
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:49,210
We have spent a lot of this year out of town Max.

215
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:54,170
So we've devoted our resources to developing the ultimate

216
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:59,130
online experience SOL. He finally wants to upgrade.

217
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:01,289
All right well what happened to the other thing? What happened to bluster

218
00:21:01,289 --> 00:21:03,529
blaster? Where's bluster blaster? There was a

219
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:09,609
processing accident while developing our latest invention.

220
00:21:09,609 --> 00:21:14,170
And finds him. Haddock is the best kind of fish. He's a different person.

221
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:19,369
And finds him. We regret any inconvenience this may have caused.

222
00:21:19,369 --> 00:21:23,849
And finds him. Thanks for asking. And finds you.

223
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:29,269
And finds you. I like that one. That's a good one.

224
00:21:29,269 --> 00:21:32,309
Can you guys fix it? Can you guys fix bluster blaster?

225
00:21:32,309 --> 00:21:36,789
They had me fixed before they brought me home. He sounds like Homer.

226
00:21:36,789 --> 00:21:41,480
It is Homer Simpson. After all this time

227
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,480
you're not offering any car upgrades? None at all.

228
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:53,160
We regret the invention. It is much too dangerous.

229
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:58,440
Intrigued? Go on. It's the super high-powered antenna for wireless

230
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:03,960
internet access while on the road. There are problems. Using it could

231
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:08,359
result in catastrophic electrical failure and spontaneous explosion of

232
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:11,319
your vehicle. Yeah it is. And what are the

233
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:16,599
problems? You're right. We want the antenna. Super high powered antenna.

234
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:21,000
We spent our entire savings on development.

235
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,680
We can only give it to you if you help us market SOL.

236
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,960
Take the provided CD launcher and use it to give

237
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,880
installation discs to zombies throughout the city.

238
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,920
We like marketing. And we love shooting things.

239
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:41,240
I like wearing short pants. Would you like to begin driving now?

240
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:50,059
Yes. Affirmative. Initiating augmented reality driving sequence.

241
00:22:50,059 --> 00:22:55,099
Do the droopy boys. Wait wait wait. Is this pizza?

242
00:22:55,099 --> 00:22:59,339
Not pizza. Pizza man? What's the newspaper one?

243
00:22:59,339 --> 00:23:03,980
Newspaper throw? Paper boy. There it is.

244
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:07,980
I want to shoot things. Please deliver the magic of SOL

245
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:11,259
to the displayed number of zombies. 10 zombies.

246
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:16,460
We'll make that big. And you must do it in the allotted time.

247
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:23,140
Pizza man. Ready go. Do I have a cursor?

248
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:32,200
Um what's going on? Why is my cursor off the screen?

249
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:50,259
How do I? Okay it's right click. I'm sitting there driving into him.

250
00:23:50,259 --> 00:23:56,859
This is newspaper man. Congratulations you won. He said that.

251
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:02,359
Well done. We've installed your new super high powered antenna.

252
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:07,799
We cannot be held liable for any injury or loss of life.

253
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:10,920
I'm liking the sound of this more and more.

254
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:15,240
Please demonstrate the operation of the antenna to our big winner.

255
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:19,000
Not too late. I don't want to see the bright light again.

256
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:25,220
Very well. Do the droopy boys. All right I will.

257
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:29,779
Oh boy. Oh no.

258
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:37,500
Got it. All right so we got the antenna. What does this do? So we can now

259
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:44,309
somebody say what the fuck is this? Wow. Salmon man. We installed something

260
00:24:44,309 --> 00:24:47,670
well for once. I won't be able to just pull it off.

261
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:52,299
Okay so we got the antenna. Let's go. I didn't talk to Stinky.

262
00:24:52,299 --> 00:25:13,690
I'll make sure I have a conversation with Stinky. Now do Garfield.

263
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:17,049
All right we want to. Ever heard of a zombie factory? You know anything about

264
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:22,089
a zombie factory? Oh sure. I was a foreman at a zombie

265
00:25:22,089 --> 00:25:25,369
factory for a year while I was writing my opera.

266
00:25:25,369 --> 00:25:29,690
They're good workers as long as you don't let them unionize.

267
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:33,690
No this isn't a factory that hires zombies. It's a factory that makes

268
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:38,809
zombies. Oh well then uh did you say zombies?

269
00:25:38,809 --> 00:25:45,509
I thought you said elves. Elves? Zombies giving you much trouble Stinky?

270
00:25:45,509 --> 00:25:49,190
If that is your real name. To the German boys. Oh no.

271
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:52,869
They're a nuisance but at least they eat quickly and leave.

272
00:25:52,869 --> 00:25:58,539
Your friend Lincoln is the real horror.

273
00:25:58,539 --> 00:26:02,299
Hey it's it's the voice that I do when I do somebody that's not me.

274
00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:05,900
Literally almost 90 percent of people that I do a voice for it sounds

275
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,279
like this. Is that what you're looking for?

276
00:26:12,869 --> 00:26:16,390
So have you heard from grandpa Stinky lately?

277
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:22,470
Like from beyond the grave? What are you talking about? Grandpa's still on his

278
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:29,930
Himalayan mountain climbing junket. I thought you said grandpa Stinky was

279
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:33,930
on an around the world cruise. Let's watch as the spider tries to

280
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:38,329
free herself from her own web of lies. Oh he sent me a

281
00:26:38,329 --> 00:26:41,450
postcard. His cruise was hijacked by Sherpa

282
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:45,690
terrorists. They ended up making him their god and now they're following him

283
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:48,569
on a quest to scale the world's tallest peaks.

284
00:26:48,569 --> 00:26:57,099
Well her story does seem to hold up. Do Kylo Ren?

285
00:26:57,099 --> 00:27:01,180
Okay give Abe a break. Come on give Abe a break. He's on the rebound.

286
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:04,700
He keeps trying to pay me in confederate money. Who does that?

287
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:11,210
That doesn't even make sense. It was pretty nice of grandpa Stinky to

288
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:14,009
leave his entire restaurant empire to you.

289
00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:18,089
Some empire? Zombies, deadbeat ex-presidents,

290
00:27:18,089 --> 00:27:22,250
trivia cheaters. Makes me wonder if it was worth the effort.

291
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:26,420
If what was worth the effort? Oh nothing.

292
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:29,460
All right what's going on with the sun lamp? What's with a sun lamp woman

293
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,940
who will call Stinky for the sake of convenience?

294
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:36,579
So that's what that is. Oh I mean of course that's what that is.

295
00:27:36,579 --> 00:27:41,140
Have to look my best you know. The magazine set such an unrealistic

296
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:44,420
standard of beauty for grandpa murderers.

297
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:48,710
Can we have the sun lamp? Can we have your sun lamp? What could you

298
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:51,670
possibly need it for? Does she just admit to killing her father? Max needs a UV bulb for his

299
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:55,589
teeth bleaching regimen. You think a smile this wife comes naturally?

300
00:27:55,589 --> 00:28:01,349
Well go ahead. Teeth bleaching. I don't need I mean I'm done with it.

301
00:28:01,349 --> 00:28:04,950
Why wait why do you she said some beauty doing in a restaurant?

302
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:07,349
Did you think the food wasn't hazardous enough without the threat of

303
00:28:07,349 --> 00:28:10,390
melanoma? Oh that I was just going through some

304
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:13,829
of the old things Stinky grandpa had in storage.

305
00:28:13,829 --> 00:28:17,190
I need a big box for packing things that need to be sent

306
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:23,339
away. Okay let's order some. We'd like to order something.

307
00:28:23,339 --> 00:28:27,420
Supplies are low because of the zombie attacks so uh we're probably out.

308
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:30,619
You do realize that's not going to stop us right?

309
00:28:30,619 --> 00:28:37,099
Go ahead. Do you have any enchiladas? Crab and salamander enchiladas in

310
00:28:37,099 --> 00:28:40,059
green sauce. Sal I want new jobs in Greta

311
00:28:40,059 --> 00:28:45,109
van Suster and doing double dutch on the back of a rogue elephant.

312
00:28:45,109 --> 00:28:50,069
I'd like what's the special today? My special gooey molasses tar cake.

313
00:28:50,069 --> 00:28:54,150
It's an ancient family recipe. Ancient? You've heard of the labrea

314
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:57,589
tar pits of course but have you ever tasted them?

315
00:28:57,589 --> 00:29:02,230
So I'll take two slices. Sorry I used up the blowtorch on some

316
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:05,750
zombies who didn't tip. Are we ever going to meet the guy in the back?

317
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:09,430
You're welcome to look at it though just don't touch.

318
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:14,069
Okay so we can take the lamp. Let's just see what this is. Seared grouper in a

319
00:29:14,069 --> 00:29:18,069
maple syrup reduction with bacon wrapped dates and toffee chips

320
00:29:18,069 --> 00:29:21,430
served on a bed of Venezuelan newspaper clippings. Sal

321
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:27,849
number three. Chicken chow mein with chocolate covered raisins and a

322
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:30,970
caramel swirl. Sal give me a hyperactive spider

323
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:33,930
monkey and a powder blue cardigan and why don't we go ahead and wrestle

324
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:35,849
them to the ground and tickle them till they piece.

325
00:29:35,849 --> 00:29:41,559
I have got to see what goes on in this kitchen.

326
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:46,039
Nothing for us thanks. Let's go get the sign.

327
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:55,859
Want to help me carry this thing around Max? I just want the bulb.

328
00:29:55,859 --> 00:30:00,339
Get the bulb. Did you just get deja vu?

329
00:30:00,339 --> 00:30:07,079
Just close your eyes and it'll pass. I'm looking over here with 12,000 drop

330
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:11,109
frames in 30 minutes. Usually I have like

331
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:15,910
ah that's so bad. 12,000 drop frames in 30 minutes is like

332
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:21,750
150,000 drop frames for the stream.

333
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:54,660
Fuck me. It's hard. I'm gonna just relax. No no no no no just

334
00:30:54,660 --> 00:31:00,299
relax. It's gonna pass. It'll pass in like 30 20 minutes or

335
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:07,059
so. It's gonna pass and nothing will be fine.

336
00:31:07,059 --> 00:31:14,579
Do you breathing? I'm trying to do my breathing. So we have a

337
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:24,009
light bulb. 2% calm.

338
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:29,099
Get lost. He's gonna start crying. It's just

339
00:31:29,099 --> 00:31:45,269
very distracting.

340
00:31:46,069 --> 00:31:51,420
Okay I'm fine. It's closed. Bosco went into hiding when we

341
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:55,740
convinced him T H E M were coming. Bosco's not

342
00:31:55,740 --> 00:32:03,539
available anymore? Wait that's not true but I can't

343
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:10,180
talk to Bosco? It's closed.

344
00:32:10,339 --> 00:32:27,240
It's getting worse. I need I need positive breathing.

345
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:36,809
Jerma call Jerma. He's crying. All right so what can I do with the bulb?

346
00:32:36,809 --> 00:32:40,410
It's the UV bulb from stinky sun lamp. Can I

347
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:50,859
put that onto zombies? Six seconds in six seconds out six seconds in six

348
00:32:50,859 --> 00:33:02,490
seconds out. I'm not sure quite where I'd stick it.

349
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:06,650
I thought like I thought starting early was supposed to

350
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:10,819
prevent the internet problems. It usually starts later. At least the last

351
00:33:10,819 --> 00:33:25,079
like week it has. Okay let's go over to Sybil's.

352
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:29,400
Take a number and I'll be with you. Oh hey Sybil. Hi Sam and Max.

353
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,440
I'm uh out of applications right now so

354
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:37,160
uh let's just be friends. Sure. What happened to Abe?

355
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:40,359
I'm sure I don't know to whom you are referring.

356
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:47,720
So Mr. Mollman. Oh it's him. Sorry. He's back. Harry tell me more about

357
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:54,980
you. Well let me see interesting things about me.

358
00:33:54,980 --> 00:34:10,710
You got nothing. That's it. He's got nothing.

359
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:16,380
Harry Mollman last time we saw you you were. Yeah yeah on the moon.

360
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:19,260
What's all this I keep hearing about zombie attacks?

361
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:25,019
They're everywhere. You boys have guns right? Are we just not getting through to

362
00:34:25,019 --> 00:34:27,900
these people? Yeah we're really not that complicated

363
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:32,500
Harry. How's the suitor business? How are things

364
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:36,739
going with you and Sybil? Oh she's playing hard to get but

365
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:42,099
women have a hard time resisting my charms.

366
00:34:42,099 --> 00:34:46,099
Oh she'll grope about me. High speed and have all the markets

367
00:34:46,099 --> 00:34:49,300
started for me.

368
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:02,860
I'm sorry guys. There's nothing I can do.

369
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:06,860
Oh what do I do? What do I do about it? You know?

370
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:21,530
Oh it's all right. What do I do? Nice spam chat. Very cool. Coxy pasta.

371
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:25,690
I'm hoping that it just stops but right now it's

372
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:28,809
it's almost like I shouldn't play this until it does stop.

373
00:35:28,809 --> 00:35:33,099
Like it's almost like I should just turn the webcam on and fucking smile at you

374
00:35:33,099 --> 00:35:43,909
until like it's certain that I'm not gonna drop 20 fucking thousand frames.

375
00:35:43,909 --> 00:35:46,710
We'll see if this goes on for like another 20 minutes or so I'm gonna

376
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,789
have to we'll have to do something else because it really is

377
00:35:48,789 --> 00:35:53,349
this is getting to be just unbearable. I hate to break it to you Harry but

378
00:35:53,349 --> 00:35:57,909
Sybil's not that into you. She's more into the whole hard rock scene.

379
00:35:57,909 --> 00:36:01,429
Just wait till she gets a load of my oboe.

380
00:36:01,429 --> 00:36:05,349
Was that clumsy innuendo or a pathetic attempt to sound cool?

381
00:36:05,349 --> 00:36:11,190
Both. And you have no shot. You really think you have a chance with Sybil?

382
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:18,389
I'm in it to win it. All right do you know anything about the

383
00:36:18,389 --> 00:36:20,949
zombie factory? Do you know anything about a zombie factory?

384
00:36:20,949 --> 00:36:24,550
Zombies don't make things. They break them.

385
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:28,469
No it's a factory that makes zombies. Inconceivable.

386
00:36:28,469 --> 00:36:32,230
That's like making hate and evil and awfulness.

387
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:37,210
So you're saying you don't like zombies?

388
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:40,650
Oh okay. What have you got against zombies?

389
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:44,250
Disgusting creatures. They're always breaking things.

390
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:50,090
Zombies are why we can't have nice things.

391
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:54,170
Zombies why zombies break things? Zombies is that they break things?

392
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:58,969
Yes stupid clumsy undead. And that bothers you more than the brain

393
00:36:58,969 --> 00:37:03,539
eating? They're hell on knickknacks.

394
00:37:03,539 --> 00:37:06,179
But oh he's still doing prismatology. Are you still into prismatology?

395
00:37:06,179 --> 00:37:10,659
Oh no. Between the four of us I wasn't that into it in the first place.

396
00:37:10,659 --> 00:37:13,860
You just relocated to the moon for it.

397
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:18,889
Well think how great docent looks on a resume.

398
00:37:18,889 --> 00:37:23,670
You just relocated to the moon. What are you doing for work these days?

399
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:27,510
Well I'm hoping the stipend from this job holds me over.

400
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:30,789
Sybil's paying men to be her suitor? Of course not.

401
00:37:30,789 --> 00:37:45,449
But they don't know that. That's Marge. See you later Harry. Zombie!

402
00:37:45,449 --> 00:37:54,070
That was like a peaked Mike scream. All right anything in here besides talking

403
00:37:54,070 --> 00:38:01,219
to Sybil. Let's see. Makes me feel like I'm in a deli. I am

404
00:38:01,219 --> 00:38:07,449
not piece of meat. What gives Sybil? Did you start your

405
00:38:07,449 --> 00:38:11,610
dating service again? Not quite. All my clients are applying

406
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:15,369
for dates with me. As kind of officers of the law we

407
00:38:15,369 --> 00:38:17,610
have to point out that that's kind of illegal.

408
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:21,130
Does that mean we can shoot her to regain health points or something?

409
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:25,929
What? No. Get your heads out of the gutter. It's not like that.

410
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:32,539
I'm looking for my soul mate. How are you gonna do that? How are you

411
00:38:32,539 --> 00:38:35,420
going to find your soul mate? Not by jumping in with the first

412
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:40,380
reanimated statue that comes along. That's for sure. I've got the

413
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:44,219
initial screening and then rigorous interviews and

414
00:38:44,219 --> 00:38:52,010
finally the soul mater. I want it. The soul mater?

415
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:56,969
What does the soul mater do? Not sure. I want it in an online auction and the

416
00:38:56,969 --> 00:39:01,610
instructions are all in Sanskrit. Something about ripping souls from

417
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:04,090
across the plains to reunite them with

418
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:09,130
corruptible mortal vessels. Doesn't that sound romantic? I could

419
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:11,929
just die. Sounds like a very real possibility.

420
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:18,070
What's going on with the picture? You can still clearly tell who that is.

421
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:21,590
All you did is you just you just gave like Abraham Lincoln

422
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:30,280
Batman eyes. You just made him Batman. All right do you know anything about

423
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,480
the zombies? Do you know anything about a place called the zombie factory?

424
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:40,280
Zombies? Where? Hmm. Irrational fear of zombies. I'll do a

425
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,960
Batman impression. Interesting. But yes I did get an email about

426
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,199
something like that from some friends in Europe

427
00:39:47,079 --> 00:40:03,300
I'm sorry. That sucked. Sorry my mind is elsewhere right now.

428
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:10,039
That was pretty that was pretty that was pretty good Batman impression for

429
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:14,760
where my brain is at. Can we get the soul mater up with

430
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,880
that soul mater Sybil? If you're not married by now there's

431
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:21,880
not much time left. There's plenty of time. I still have a

432
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:26,039
lot of data to analyze while I figure out how the soul mater works.

433
00:40:28,219 --> 00:40:33,500
Okay have you had a lot of applicants? A few. If you know anybody

434
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:39,340
anybody else of course send them my way. A lot of these guys have no chance

435
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:42,460
but I'm still interviewing them to be polite.

436
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:46,139
Speaking of which what kind of movies do you like Harry?

437
00:40:46,139 --> 00:40:51,610
No I don't go to the movies that much because of my stigmatism.

438
00:40:51,610 --> 00:41:03,719
Wait why couldn't you go to the movie?

439
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:06,760
Remember to lock up tonight so the zombies can't get in.

440
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:12,920
Get in? There are zombies right outside. I'm not going to lock my door.

441
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:16,679
This is a public place and they have the right to peacefully assemble

442
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:27,739
just like anyone else. It's nice knowing you chat. Wait what?

443
00:41:27,739 --> 00:41:32,500
Oh man am I still live? That was a full-on zero.

444
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:47,130
Hello? I was at zero for like three straight seconds.

445
00:41:47,130 --> 00:42:02,539
My blood is heating up. It's starting to get hot in here.

446
00:42:02,619 --> 00:42:06,860
Six seconds in, six seconds out, six seconds in, six seconds out.

447
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:11,559
This is not like a walkie-talkie. It's like the fucking internet.

448
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:13,320
You know what I mean?

449
00:42:36,519 --> 00:42:41,099
Sorry I didn't get that one. Over.

450
00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:49,139
We have not much time.

451
00:42:49,139 --> 00:42:51,300
Don't you want to give Abe another chance?

452
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:56,099
Abe who? You were telling me more about yourself Harry.

453
00:42:56,099 --> 00:43:01,619
I was detailing my various prescriptions and inhalers if I remember correctly.

454
00:43:03,989 --> 00:43:05,829
Yeah I'm just driving around through tunnels.

455
00:43:07,829 --> 00:43:10,070
Streaming from my laptop. Just hold on guys.

456
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,389
Yeah I'm playing seven max.

457
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:17,019
I hired an uber driver to drive me through a tunnel back and forth.

458
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:32,420
We just went through one.

459
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:35,500
We just went through another tunnel. Hey we good?

460
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:38,059
How are you?

461
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:47,260
That seems like a waste of money.

462
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:50,789
Kind of like most North American internet.

463
00:44:09,699 --> 00:44:12,179
LOL dude plus 40.

464
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:20,300
Good luck finding your soul mate.

465
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,780
This has nothing to do with blocks Sam.

466
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:32,340
I can't I can't guys I'm sorry.

467
00:44:33,059 --> 00:44:34,820
We're gonna have to just hang out on camera.

468
00:44:36,519 --> 00:44:40,489
This is 13 percent of the stream has been unwatchable.

469
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:47,820
It really is like every set it's just not I don't know I want to like enjoy it.

470
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:50,619
I don't want to have to keep because there's a lot of dialogue.

471
00:44:51,659 --> 00:44:52,300
You know what I mean?

472
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:58,219
There's a shitload of dialogue that I don't want it to be like walkie talkie cutout drop down to zero.

473
00:44:58,219 --> 00:45:04,070
So uh I'm sorry unfortunately that we have to change to do something else for a little while.

474
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:14,630
Uh this is this is the worst it's been since it started having problems again like last week.

475
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:17,030
So sorry everybody I really I really do apologize.

476
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:23,460
I'm not gonna let it get me annoyed or angry if for some reason we get green again in the next

477
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:26,099
20 minutes or so just hanging out.

478
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:37,269
Why is it always me and not other streamers?

479
00:45:37,269 --> 00:45:41,030
What so many streamers deal with internet problems?

480
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:43,750
What do you mean I'm the only streamer you've ever seen with internet issues?

481
00:45:44,469 --> 00:45:46,230
That's that's pretty rare.

482
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:52,139
All right let me just go like this.

483
00:45:52,860 --> 00:46:03,610
You're the only streamer I've ever seen.

484
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:08,869
Nova's been fucked lately.

485
00:46:08,869 --> 00:46:10,309
Yeah I've heard I heard about that too.

486
00:46:20,309 --> 00:46:22,150
Call tech support on stream they don't do anything.

487
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:28,900
Me calling tech support on stream would be like funny for five seconds and then we would realize

488
00:46:29,619 --> 00:46:31,539
oh they're just gonna tell me to turn my router off.

489
00:46:33,019 --> 00:46:38,699
I'm just gonna ping your router and maybe that'll work.

490
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:43,900
It's gonna turn you off for a couple of minutes.

491
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:57,739
Well let's um well I don't know what am I gonna do now?

492
00:46:57,739 --> 00:46:58,539
Let's go like this.

493
00:46:59,099 --> 00:46:59,820
Hey!

494
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:14,489
That was gonna have a huge face cam right now.

495
00:47:14,489 --> 00:47:15,530
Angry streamer?

496
00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:17,130
No it's more defeated.

497
00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:20,250
It's defeated streamer it's a little different.

498
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:24,920
He is ape Lincoln.

499
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:30,730
Let's talk about stream ideas.

500
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:35,690
Yeah I gotta change this.

501
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:38,969
If you if you're looking for Sam and Max and we'll do it again.

502
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:44,539
Maybe even later in like a little bit once we'll try to get this to go through here.

503
00:47:45,179 --> 00:47:57,510
Let me just say what do I even title this stream right now?

504
00:48:00,139 --> 00:48:04,659
Frames are depleting.

505
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:11,829
Frames are depleting.

506
00:48:11,829 --> 00:48:15,000
Transformer?

507
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,030
Maybe I don't know I'm I'm kind of a little pissy right now.

508
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:21,269
I don't know if I would be like I don't think I could do it.

509
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:23,909
I'm like a little pissy right now.

510
00:48:23,909 --> 00:48:26,309
I don't know if I could get in there be like okay let's have fun.

511
00:48:26,309 --> 00:48:28,389
I'm like I'm kind of pissy.
