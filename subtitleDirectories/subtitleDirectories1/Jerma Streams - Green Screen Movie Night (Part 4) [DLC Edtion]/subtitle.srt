00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:11,939
Hello, ladies and gentlemen. It is time for DLC Crack Night. Welcome, welcome, welcome.

2
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:21,760
Well, it's not really night yet, but it will be when it's over. This is, uh, we

3
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,239
might be in for a long one. At least longer than you've been used to recently.

4
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:39,700
There are 258 videos on this stream today. Maybe. Alright, listen. If we get

5
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,780
like five hours into this and like I can't take it anymore, like I might get

6
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:50,170
hurt. If I start, if I laugh too hard, I'm gonna get, I'm probably gonna get hurt. So

7
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:56,960
we got, we're gonna go into this very very much with we'll see. But there are

8
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:06,030
six and a half hours of videos and that has been shaved. There were hundreds and

9
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:13,590
hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of submissions. I actually was probably

10
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,430
gonna talk to the mods here and see if we could maybe, like we did last time, do

11
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:25,170
like an extended edition where maybe we could have, oh, here's like the, is the

12
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:30,209
extended cut with like another extra 300 videos or like 200 videos or something.

13
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:35,450
I think we did something like that last time, though. But for the stream

14
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:40,090
purposes, there are just over six and a half hours of videos. Just about six and

15
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:45,859
a half hours. And that's without any pauses in between. That's another thing

16
00:01:45,859 --> 00:01:50,939
we have to keep in mind. So it's six and a half straight hours of video content.

17
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:56,629
Hurry up, hurry up. I'm not just gonna, no, I've been waiting for this for a long

18
00:01:56,629 --> 00:02:04,109
time. And I haven't seen really any of these. I'm looking forward to it. I want

19
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:06,590
to wait, people gotta trickle in, man. You don't want to just start the movie

20
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:13,289
before everyone gets in. You gotta have the previews first. Now this is all you

21
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:17,240
got. It's me talking to you for a preview. When you go to the movie theater, the

22
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:26,560
movie doesn't just start at 730. The movie starts at like 755. It does. No, it

23
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,139
doesn't. What do you mean it does? At 730, the previews start for like 20 minutes.

24
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:38,259
And then you have to watch the same like AMC movie theater commercial where the

25
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:43,020
Coca-Cola fills up the cup really fast and it fizzes all over the place. And it's

26
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:48,099
a fucking large and they give it to this like guy that's like five, six, my size,

27
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:54,039
five, seven, five, eight. And is supposed to drink that whole thing? No. You get

28
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:59,219
this huge pot thing of popcorn. Nobody eats a jumbo popcorn. They eat the top

29
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:03,259
half or eat the top third of it. And then they can look sad and they go, fuck, I

30
00:03:03,259 --> 00:03:06,949
shouldn't have got a big one. And then what? What do you think happens to it?

31
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:13,460
That's why. Did I ever tell you the time that Burger Boy brought in to the movie

32
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,979
theater, a bag of double cheeseburgers and ate them like popcorn? Did I ever tell

33
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:25,659
you that story? I did, right? Yeah. Yeah. But those of you that don't know, Burger

34
00:03:25,659 --> 00:03:30,979
Boy went, we went to the movie theaters and he brought with him, it was his

35
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:37,879
popcorn. His movie snack was a bag of probably six or seven McDoubles. And

36
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:47,819
that's what he ate for the movie. Like it was popcorn. And if you think about it,

37
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:50,259
like, okay, see, he was taking the wrappers and he was like putting the

38
00:03:50,259 --> 00:03:55,090
wrappers in the bag. And then at the very end, he squished it down to this tiny

39
00:03:55,090 --> 00:04:02,610
little just small in your fist bag of waste. And he threw it in the trash. Like

40
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:06,090
fuck, fuck all this bullshit with like get a large popcorn and dump the popcorn

41
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:10,879
in the trash and this big cardboard bucket. Burger Boy was being

42
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:20,100
environmentally friendly. But yeah, he did eat seven McDoubles over the course

43
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:32,620
of about two hours. That's based. He's a king. No, he's still just a boy. He's not

44
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:37,699
Burger King. That would be copyright infringement. He's just a boy. Don't

45
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:46,800
rip. Don't forget that. You can't be Burger King. One of those already

46
00:04:47,800 --> 00:05:03,899
exists. You can be King Burger. He's a sellout. What? Fuck the king. Excuse me.

47
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:13,939
Savor the king, please. Get it right. It's been rebranded. Anyways, we're gonna get

48
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:20,240
started. There's lots of videos. I'm looking forward to it. I have a

49
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,639
playlist. It's just gonna play. I'm gonna pause it. Well, maybe it depends on what

50
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:34,509
it is. Here we go. You guys ready? Are you ready to do this? Here, I have to prove

51
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:41,439
that I exist like once every three or four years, three or four weeks. I exist.

52
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:46,600
One thing that I have noticed about these videos, kind of funny in its own

53
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:55,459
way, is this green screen footage was taken at the absolute pinnacle, the

54
00:05:55,459 --> 00:06:02,800
absolute part, the absolute in the middle of the quarantine. And my skin is like

55
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:10,399
transparent white. Hadn't been outside in probably fucking seven or eight weeks. I

56
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:16,019
have lost a little bit of weight since being on this medical problem, and I had

57
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:24,759
this quarantine haircut, and I look fucking crazy. I look, let's just be real.

58
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:28,839
Let's be honest with everybody. I gotta be honest with you. Since then, I've put

59
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:31,680
on another couple pounds. I've been alright. I've been trying to treat some

60
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:38,029
of these issues. I look really fucking crazy, but it works in a way because then

61
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:41,750
you can use it for whatever you want. Hey, you want a crazy guy in your fucking

62
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:52,199
YouTube video? I got DLC for you. There's plenty of it. You look scary. Fucking

63
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:56,939
quarantine haircut, like my haircut was like long on this side, short on this

64
00:06:56,939 --> 00:07:00,720
side, like puffed up like this. I like made my face look like it's skinny. I had

65
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,879
like a pale white face from not being outside in like eight weeks. I lost weight

66
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:12,759
from the fucking medical shit, and I didn't even realize. Guys, I have not

67
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:16,959
looked at really any footage until like very recently. I looked at a couple

68
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:21,680
things really early on, but I didn't really grasp how crazed I actually

69
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:31,100
looked in a lot of these clips. Start the movie. The fucking

70
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:35,100
previews, alright? Yo, don't talk during the previews. Turn your phone off, guy.

71
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:41,160
You're talking during the preview. I'm the preview. None of you should be

72
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,600
talking. I'm the preview. You're at the movie theater right now. You're

73
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:52,720
watching. I'm the preview. Stop talking and turn your phone off now. That's what

74
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:58,230
they should do. Forget about, fuck the Coke, like, let's go get a snack in the kitchen.

75
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:03,509
No, no, no, no, no, no. Have me, I'll go full screen. Have me say, hello everybody,

76
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:08,470
welcome to the movie. Shut up, shut up, and like point around. Hey, you in the back,

77
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:16,259
shut up. Turn off that phone right now, motherfucker. And I do, it's 20 minutes

78
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:20,180
before a movie starts. Have me be so irritating that I piss everybody off for

79
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,649
them to either leave the movie theater or turn their phone off. I'll be like,

80
00:08:23,649 --> 00:08:28,410
turn off your phone, turn off your fucking phone, you're all assholes. Like, I'll do,

81
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:33,740
it'll be 20 straight minutes. And then it'll be like, God, like, fine, Jesus, man,

82
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:40,299
shut the fuck up. Or they'll leave. And we got their money anyway. Right, folks?

83
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:51,200
Produce gave 10 subs. They'll specifically keep the phone on. No, they won't.

84
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,299
Because if a phone notification sound is played, there'll be microphones

85
00:08:56,299 --> 00:09:01,279
around every, by the way, there'll be microphones at every seat. You'll lean in

86
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:06,919
and go, Hey, what just happened? I went to the bathroom. Like I pop up on the

87
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:15,279
screen. Seat 21. Seat 21B. Talking during the movie. Talking. And then everyone

88
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:33,919
will know. They'll go, what if you fart? Oh, excuse me in seat 1A. We've got a

89
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:45,370
farter here. We've got a farter in 1A. What a weird like fucking dictator movie

90
00:09:45,370 --> 00:10:00,360
theater I run. You ready for the movie? Uh-huh. Funny stream. He farted. Oh, my

91
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:12,980
thumb. You guys thumbs do this? Oh, it looks weird. What a great preview to the movie.

92
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:22,629
Hey, you guys, you guys thumbs do this too? Oh, yeah. Cool. Do they? Wow. Okay. Hey, enjoy

93
00:10:22,629 --> 00:10:38,759
hereditary. All right. You guys ready? This is called Jerma Family Road Trip.

94
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:48,440
This is video one. I think they're just random. Stoned? I'm, no, I'm not.

95
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:59,450
If I was stoned, I'd be going like this. Hey, you guys ready to fucking go? Go.

96
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:04,679
I'm stalling because I want people to be here, all right? I'm not clicking play

97
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:10,350
until at least 30,000 people are here. You gotta, I've got my ego to take care of.

98
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:23,950
Three, two, one, let's go. Hey, mom. You are in big trouble. Hey, mom. Hey, I'm gonna go to

99
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:28,720
McDonald's. Mom, what if I'm gonna go to work, bitch? Only McDonald's. We're a McDonald's

100
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:44,639
family for Christ's sake. We only eat McDonald's. Oh, excuse me. Some of us are trying to sleep.

101
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:57,049
It's just me in the same shirt. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. We can't just go one to

102
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:10,809
the other. Okay. That was, that was awesome. Turn off autoplay. Hold on. Autoplay is off already

103
00:12:10,809 --> 00:12:17,259
because this is a playlist. I don't know. Autoplay is not on. I don't have a button for it.

104
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:31,899
No, we're not doing rapid fire. I'm in a playlist. It autoflays. Ready? This is called going higher.

105
00:12:31,899 --> 00:13:08,029
Pretty good. Welcome to hell. I want to see that one again. I want to see that one again.

106
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:28,539
That was perfect. Can you see my heart through the shirt? Welcome to hell. Hey, welcome back to

107
00:13:28,539 --> 00:13:37,100
I murder you. My ASMR channel that I run before the video starts, before I virtually murder you.

108
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:43,179
Just please give me a thumbs up and a like and spread the video around to show to your parents,

109
00:13:43,179 --> 00:13:46,860
you know, and try to get me some followers. Yeah. Okay. Let's get started.

110
00:13:46,860 --> 00:14:40,639
Oh, wait, wait, wait. Why is sneaking around ASMR?

111
00:15:07,929 --> 00:15:16,879
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Did I come and kill you in real

112
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:43,019
life? What? While you're watching the video? Look at that neck. That neck is made out of like stone.

113
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:50,220
That's not even a human neck. That was carved. What are even are these? What even are these veins?

114
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:58,220
All right. Coming up next, we've got creepy guy sells you a toy. Okay. Here we go.

115
00:15:59,179 --> 00:16:11,340
Existence. I'm certain of that. And I'm giving it to you. That's right. Take it. It's yours.

116
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:18,889
$400. That's the rare Pog. What are they called? Pog Pops. That's the rare Pog. That's slimer with

117
00:16:18,889 --> 00:16:24,139
the hot dogs in his mouth. I made I bought I bought it for 500. I thought it was going to

118
00:16:24,139 --> 00:16:27,179
keep appreciating and it didn't. It went down in price a little bit, but it's still worth $400.

119
00:16:27,179 --> 00:16:34,220
$400. Wait, why am I getting like arrested? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

120
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:45,690
Hold on. Welcome to hell. This is illegal to sell a Funko pop. That's because I'm scamming. Oh,

121
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,840
I made I bought I bought it for 500. I thought it was going to keep appreciating and it didn't.

122
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:57,049
It went down in price a little bit, but it's still worth $400. In reality, it's worth about 20.

123
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:11,559
It's worth 20. Okay, this next one is called once in a lifetime. German edit. Oh, I have to make the

124
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:14,759
I got to make this really clear. Let me get on cam for this. This is really important shit.

125
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:22,650
Here we go. Here we go. So stop. Hold on. There are going to be spoilers for movies and TV shows

126
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:29,690
you have never seen before. I'm certain of it. So just listen to me when I tell you there are

127
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:34,730
going to be spoilers in this stream for TV shows that you have probably wanted to watch that now

128
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:40,279
you've seen like the last four episodes already. This is a music video. Well, maybe you haven't

129
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:43,480
even heard the song yet. I'm just saying I got to make this clear. I got to give the warning

130
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,000
right now that like you I don't know. I have no idea what's in it. I don't know what's in here.

131
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:54,400
I have this is new to me too. So I can't wait to get like season eight of the walking dead spoiled

132
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:00,400
for me. It's probably going to happen just to let you know. Okay. Once in a once in a lifetime.

133
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:26,920
Yeah, it's an intentionally bad like cartoon character haircut.

134
00:18:30,109 --> 00:19:00,220
When did I? I'm doing this. Vod's fucked. The Vod's fucked in all of these.

135
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:35,289
Is this the music video shot for shot? Is that what we're watching? Okay. This next one is

136
00:19:35,289 --> 00:19:42,829
Jerma is count Duke. Who's awful something awful apprentice. Oh yes. It's a star wars one first

137
00:19:42,829 --> 00:20:03,599
star wars one of the night books. Get ready. Chancellor, you all right? Get help. You're

138
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:08,400
gonna match for him. He's a sixth lord. We don't want to make a mess of things in front of the

139
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:28,829
chancellor. Wait, what? He killed me. My powers have doubled since the last time we met count.

140
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:33,789
What does his son just bring your idiot kid to work day?

141
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:51,440
Wait, what is he doing to me?

142
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:22,859
Shit, I shouldn't do it. Oh, no, no, no. I gotta see that again.

143
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:30,880
Chancellor, I gotta see. Wait, why is he killing me? Why does he kill me?

144
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:45,960
I supposed to be dead.

145
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:55,640
I'm so glad somebody used this.

146
00:21:57,319 --> 00:22:00,839
It's so stupid. Why would you lightsaber do that?

147
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:08,000
Was it an ice cream cone? Why a lightsaber is as easy to fall off as like a one scoop ice cream?

148
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:20,750
Shit. Oh, my God. That was fucking hilarious. Okay. This one is called Germa meets Zelda.

149
00:22:22,539 --> 00:22:30,730
Jesus. Yeah, we're gonna link to the we'll link to the whole playlist at the end. You'll be able

150
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:37,920
to watch it as many times as you want. Okay, I'm ready. I've composed myself. Germa meets

151
00:22:37,920 --> 00:23:11,079
Zelda. Why didn't I fly off the screen? This one's called Germa sings us a song. Sing solid notes.

152
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:23,309
Okay, sweat. Oh, God.

153
00:23:26,000 --> 00:24:39,000
It's pretty good. It was hitting those notes. Yeah. This is like when somebody does a Hey,

154
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,839
I did this theme song with like 10 of me doing different instruments and beatboxing.

155
00:24:43,480 --> 00:25:05,150
So I didn't do any of this. Somebody else did. I made a couple of strange noises. I loved it.

156
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:12,059
And about to look and let me tell you something. And look at this. Look at this shit. And we got

157
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:17,369
like three or four seconds of black for me to pause it and go. I loved it. All right,

158
00:25:17,369 --> 00:25:27,289
coming up next. Fortnite. Germa can't wait. Fortnite default dance. Let's see if I can

159
00:25:27,289 --> 00:25:47,200
pull this from memory. Is it like? Is it? That's a single ladies dance. I don't know it. I was

160
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:59,400
gonna do orange t shirt kid. That's the only one that I know. That really is the only thing that

161
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:03,720
I know. All right. I see in the corner already. I see this is a this is Nickelodeon. This is

162
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:14,000
I don't know what this is. This is probably a spoiler for a TV show. It's probably I don't

163
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,400
know what TV I don't know what's a spoiler for a TV show. Here we go. TV is this from Legend of

164
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:23,759
Korra. This is a Legend of Korra episode. Just if you're in the middle of watching Legend of Korra

165
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:29,690
right now and you're like, Oh shit, I got to go. Go. And they come back in exactly one minute.

166
00:26:32,089 --> 00:27:48,440
Okay. Three, two, one. A lot of mileage out of the break dance. Yeah, seems so.

167
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:54,910
We seem to be getting a lot of mileage on the break dance, which is a good thing,

168
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:59,630
because that's what made me had to take three months off of doing any strength. Hope you used

169
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:04,920
it. That was the sole reason why I was like, probably should figure out what the fuck is

170
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:16,680
wrong with me. See, I don't look like the guy that is in that video. All right. This is called

171
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:37,130
Jerma gets an S rank. You do. I know S rank. Okay. We've seen, okay, this is the best part of the

172
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:46,059
one we're about to watch is there has been like six or seven Velociraptor Jurassic Park scenes.

173
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:50,859
And I'm so happy that here comes another one. Cause I already, I just saw a spoiler. I saw the

174
00:28:50,859 --> 00:28:57,930
new Raptor and we're just, I let's, okay, let's go. You know, what's going to happen. You know,

175
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:50,480
the whole video. Wait a minute. What? If you were these two kids, you'd be like, all right,

176
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,759
there was like a frat party down the street. We're fine. Let's get the fuck out of here.

177
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:22,539
Hello episode one. Not real kids. We're not a real dinosaur.

178
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:37,289
Okay. Hold on. I want to see. Hold on. From like, I'm right here. I have to see this again.

179
00:30:38,009 --> 00:31:01,529
Wait a minute. What? That's the best part. To episode one. Not even have JermaCraft

180
00:31:01,529 --> 00:31:26,680
either. Just episode one. It's not real kids. We're not a real dinosaur. Oh, that was great.

181
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:37,500
That was awesome. Okay. Coming up next we have shit. What really happens during a German nine

182
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:50,460
eight five P break. Oh fuck me. Jesus Christ. Who's in here with me?

183
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:32,920
I was curious to how people were going to do guy goes down the water slide.

184
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:38,380
I was like, wait, is anybody even going to use this fucking footage for anything?

185
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:53,049
Yeah, I don't like your shit. You think I need this? I go bare ass. Is that implying that I go,

186
00:32:53,049 --> 00:32:59,980
I go to the bathroom into that? I don't understand. It's supposed to be guy goes down. It does. I

187
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:04,720
can't even, who cares about the context of the original clip. It doesn't matter. All that matters

188
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:13,579
is what the product, right? Okay. Here we go. Jerma plays Quidditch, but Snape hates him. Okay.

189
00:33:13,579 --> 00:33:43,339
Okay. If you're not a bunch of idiots. Excuse me. Can we be quiet, please? Leave it to me.

190
00:33:43,339 --> 00:33:57,130
Some of us are trying to sleep. Come on. Come on. Oh my God.

191
00:33:57,930 --> 00:34:10,139
Stay right here. Toothbrush. I can't do it. I can't do it. I can't do it. Up and smoke.

192
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:16,860
Every single animal on earth. There's an elephant. I found elephants.

193
00:34:16,860 --> 00:35:03,820
Okay. I think I might need to take like a year off after that one. I was leaning back and just

194
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:12,989
dying. That was fucking crazy. That was crazy. I want to, I have to see it again.

195
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:43,800
Mr. Potter. If you're not a bunch of idiots. Excuse me. Can we be quiet, please? Leave it to me.

196
00:35:43,800 --> 00:36:10,599
Some of us are trying to sleep. Oh my God. Minecraft arrow. Brush. I can't do it. Up and smoke.

197
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:17,320
Every single animal on earth. There's an elephant. I found elephants.

198
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:54,489
Oh, that was amazing. That was unbelievable. Okay. When you hear Jerma Collins is coming up next.

199
00:36:54,489 --> 00:38:03,579
Okay. This is a Spider-Man one. This is Jerma and Peter get paid. Apparently.

200
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:28,480
And you pinned them in two. For that, I give you a hundred and you're lucky to get that.

201
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,960
What? I need that money. I missed the part where that's my problem.

202
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:48,480
Why am I here? Hey, what the hell? I need that money. All right. What, what do you want?

203
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:58,320
The bat or the frying pan? You don't get the choice. I'll be taking that way. He stole the game.

204
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:10,079
Excuse me. My exit now. He could look at me. Thanks for the fucking crazy amount of money.

205
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:19,039
You could have taken that guy apart. Now he's going to get away with my money.

206
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:25,690
I need that money. What the hell? I don't even. Okay. I've seen, I have seen Spider-Man and I

207
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:33,500
don't even know what happened. Does that happen in Spider-Man? I don't, I don't remember. I feel

208
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:40,320
like that was two, three movies put together. It's been a long time. Okay. E-Clown Asylum.

209
00:39:46,000 --> 00:40:10,329
Arkham. Transformers transform into object of flight.

210
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:48,670
Fucking bones. I'm an SCP.

211
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Hey, welcome back to I murder you.

212
00:41:30,829 --> 00:41:44,880
That was scary at the end. That was fucking scary. Okay. Here we go. This is

213
00:41:47,340 --> 00:42:00,329
Jerma PG character customization. Get ready for a real jock shocker. I talk a lot of shit. I

214
00:42:00,329 --> 00:42:05,289
fly off the handle. I get angry, but I'm disciplined about it. I speak very, very clearly,

215
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:13,050
influently and intelligently. You just walk in and you just go like, I'm selecting the character.

216
00:42:13,050 --> 00:43:00,940
Okay. Quarantine or unkempt. Yeah. Voice? No, that's a motion. Hey, look at this nice ass.

217
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:12,199
What's my destiny? Slugger, disaster or magician? What's happening guys? Jerma here for the 2000

218
00:43:12,199 --> 00:43:21,150
subscriber. What do you guys want to do? I can, I can barely do any. Stuck in my robes.

219
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:38,489
Am I a wizard yet? Oh, he wants to be a wish. That's what I just did on camera too, by the way.

220
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:57,559
I just did that exact same thing off camera. Oh man. That was awesome. There was a lot of detail

221
00:43:57,559 --> 00:44:10,760
going on there. There was a ton of detail. This is called the Jerma house. Lighthouse.

222
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:14,679
This is the lighthouse. Okay. Oh, thank you. Okay. Thanks for saying that. Cause I have to

223
00:44:14,679 --> 00:44:28,800
make it really clear that I'm going to, someone's going to ruin your movie for you. We know, but I

224
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:34,079
know. But you, everybody says that until their favorite movie gets spoiled. I don't care.

225
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:41,449
Infinity war. Yeah. I've seen that one. Oh, shut up about spook hands about spoilers. Wait,

226
00:44:41,449 --> 00:44:46,429
this is the lighthouse. Wait. Oh, I haven't seen a lot. I got to get out of here quick.

227
00:44:46,429 --> 00:44:56,409
All right. This is a one minute and 40 seconds of the lighthouse. All right. Of me, of me being

228
00:44:56,409 --> 00:45:20,510
like all over it and ruining it. Here we go. Yeah. Yeah. You want me to walk around like I'm

229
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:26,360
a fucking monster and start fighting people, hating people. That's what you want me to do,

230
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:33,760
but I'm not going to do that. I've got a brain up here and it works just fine. Oh, by the way,

231
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:51,949
I got a 4.0 GPA in college. What did you have? What the fuck was that? So I heard who'd you got

232
00:45:51,949 --> 00:46:02,519
to fight today, son. I seen you swarming with a goat. Okay. Let's leave him be. Let me tell you

233
00:46:02,519 --> 00:46:10,349
something. If you can do not do it diplomatically, then you shouldn't be doing it at all. I heard

234
00:46:10,909 --> 00:46:16,840
that you punched him. Did you, you punched him? You punched him in the face. My son doesn't do

235
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:25,099
that. I'm sure I don't. Diplomacy only. You know how much trouble I can get in? More tall tales.

236
00:46:25,099 --> 00:46:30,619
I'm in the zone. You know what? I can, I'll handle it. You are grounded.

237
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:40,489
You're grounded. We don't fight in this family. Eat your gosh darn life. I keep saying that stuff

238
00:46:40,489 --> 00:46:53,820
and I don't want to. Welcome. What the fuck? Welcome back. Okay. I, whatever. Here's the

239
00:46:53,820 --> 00:47:00,400
thing about these clips. They have been transformed so, so ridiculously that I don't even know.

240
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:05,659
I, that, that could have been any movie, right? Like that could have been, that literally could

241
00:47:05,659 --> 00:47:12,679
have been anything that I've seen in my whole life. Okay. This is called German becomes a

242
00:47:12,679 --> 00:47:21,639
YouTuber. Here we go. Welcome back. Hey everybody. Guess where I am. That's right. On vacation. Take

243
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:27,949
a look. I never get to go out of places like this. That's so much fun for me. And before we video

244
00:47:27,949 --> 00:47:32,590
get started, if you could please give me a thumbs up for being on vacation. Well, you're not on

245
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:37,789
vacation. You're doing all this cool fun shit and you're not. And I'm going to continue to do

246
00:47:37,789 --> 00:47:40,909
all kinds of really cool shit. And you're just going to watch me do cool shit.

247
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:48,989
Well, the plinketto board, that sure worked out great. God, that looks like fun. That looks like

248
00:47:48,989 --> 00:47:54,800
a lot of fun. I wish I could get up there. Is this, is this red letter media? Hello. Welcome to

249
00:47:54,800 --> 00:48:02,250
another episode of best of the worst. I'm Mike. My name's German nine eight five. What? I'm a huge fan

250
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:07,369
of yours. I get guys sick and I, I, well, okay. You don't mind. I'm really sweating right now.

251
00:48:07,369 --> 00:48:12,599
Okay. So I spin the wheel. I'll spin the wheel. You look okay.

252
00:48:17,579 --> 00:48:31,530
Did it go the other way? Yeah. Oh fuck. Yes. We're going to be going through our fursuit crushes.

253
00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:40,650
Wait, what? He's killing me. Oh, he's a very sweet suitor.

254
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:48,250
So, um, he's a, he's a dancer. Yeah. I just get lost in his eyes. He's so dreamy. He's got real

255
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:55,050
nice eyes. You can just kind of stare at them for a while. Ken confirm is a good cuddler. He's got

256
00:48:55,050 --> 00:49:05,199
a real nice curl on his suit and he's also a YouTuber. That's right. He is. Hey, your memories

257
00:49:05,199 --> 00:49:11,199
have arrived. Huh? That's real cute. Photo dome. Look at that. First one. Wait, wait, wait, wait,

258
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:19,389
hold on. Look at that. Okay. The one on the left, seriously, I'm sorry. I have to pause this.

259
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:28,750
The one on the left looks like a colored pencil version of the one on the right. Like that one

260
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:35,719
on the left is like a good piece of art crayons and stuff. The one on the right is a person.

261
00:49:35,719 --> 00:49:42,860
What is the thing on the left that looks like a police sketch? Yeah, it does. That looks like a

262
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:54,889
police sketch of a person scuffed footage of you. Okay. Let's go. That's real cute. Photo dome.

263
00:49:55,449 --> 00:50:03,340
Look at that. First one is the sky. Skies can be cool sometimes, I guess. That's a rock.

264
00:50:04,139 --> 00:50:08,510
The pretty interesting growth of a rock. The way that it was growing out of the ground was pretty

265
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:16,460
cool. I'm getting like deja vu right now. It doesn't make any sense. These are fucking terrible.

266
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:23,820
Did I do this exact same thing and go, oh, this looks like shit? This happened the last time.

267
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:37,820
It's in a twilight zone. Holy shit. Twilight zone. Oh, this is an alien. A bug is going to blow

268
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:44,250
out of my head. My head is going to explode and those two eyes are bug eyes that has taken over

269
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:49,449
my body. And the rest of the body is where my nose is. And it's like a big reveal. Holy shit.

270
00:50:57,869 --> 00:51:07,070
Hey, what's going on, everybody? I am here on vaca... Do it fucking right. Oh my god. So bad.

271
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:33,769
That stupid ass channel. Okay, Jeremy goes to war. Wow. Do you see this? Do you want it? Here,

272
00:51:34,489 --> 00:51:44,699
take it. What the fuck? Take it. Take this from me. Take this from me. Take this from me right now.

273
00:51:44,699 --> 00:51:48,699
Take it from me. Take it from me, dude. I don't want to fucking hold it anymore. Take it from me.

274
00:51:48,699 --> 00:51:53,179
Take this thing out of my fucking hands before I freak out. Take it from me. Take it. Take it

02:08:29,550 --> 02:08:35,470
truly puts me in touch with the creator of the universe this is amazing what a discovery

617
02:08:38,670 --> 02:08:48,029

624
02:09:33,039 --> 02:09:36,880

627
02:09:45,500 --> 02:09:52,699
i just saw that and go i don't know what it is whatever whatever whatever all right

628
02:09:52,699 --> 02:09:59,689
this is called germa sets up a tent that was great but how do you get inside yeah it's all

629
02:09:59,689 --> 02:10:06,029
crushy looking

630
02:10:29,800 --> 02:10:36,590
that was awesome hey folks so as the title of this video states i have made a germa you i made a

631
02:10:36,590 --> 02:10:45,500
germa keyboard what do you mean a germ what do you mean a keyboard this looks like an incredibly

632
02:10:45,500 --> 02:10:54,359
elaborate setup um all right i'm intrigued a keyboard but what is a germa keyboard you may

633
02:10:54,359 --> 02:11:01,239
be asking well i like to think of it as a tool to make live germa edited music videos or youtube

634
02:11:01,239 --> 02:11:06,350
poop music videos if people still call them that basically it plays audio and video at the same

635
02:11:06,350 --> 02:11:12,699
time through the so wait a minute this is back when looney tunes used to have a live orchestra play

636
02:11:12,779 --> 02:11:27,000
over their cartoon this is what this is don't pause don't pause videos or youtube poop music

637
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:32,119
videos if people still call them that basically it plays audio and video at the same time through

638
02:11:32,119 --> 02:11:37,159
the push of a key the main reason the video looks like this is so i can prove that it's not edited

639
02:11:37,159 --> 02:11:43,340
video and is actually the keyboard now it's not really that robust yet i've only got one song

640
02:11:43,340 --> 02:11:48,619
sort of pre-programmed in but i'm happy with where it's at and i figured that i would show it off

641
02:11:48,619 --> 02:11:54,329
first let's go over real quick how it works we got my keyboard connected via midi cable to my

642
02:11:54,329 --> 02:12:00,170
interface which sends information to both pro tools and my program audio from pro tools is going out

643
02:12:00,170 --> 02:12:05,930
to my looper but only to put effects on as i see fit and that audio is being recorded elsewhere

644
02:12:05,930 --> 02:12:10,430
there's got a looper now let's talk about the function of each of these keys up here is my

645
02:12:10,430 --> 02:12:16,430
pre-programmed song where i've got kick clap chords beeps bass and most importantly sneezes

646
02:12:16,430 --> 02:12:20,989
each of these trigger a loop when they're pressed all of these pressed in time together form the

647
02:12:20,989 --> 02:12:26,970
full song during which i can drop out parts as i please also i can give germa fancy backing lights

648
02:12:26,970 --> 02:12:32,760
using these two guys wow now these keys are the real fun stuff each of them correspond to a

649
02:12:32,760 --> 02:12:37,560
particular germa clip from his most recent green screen stream edited to match the tempo of the

650
02:12:37,560 --> 02:12:42,489
song each of them are sensitive to the duration of the key press so clips can be cut short if you

651
02:12:42,569 --> 02:12:47,609
need and there is no limitation as to how many can be pressed at once so you can go wild

652
02:12:49,119 --> 02:12:54,079
and lastly down here is the more straight up keyboard with two octaves of germa goodness

653
02:12:54,079 --> 02:13:00,640
featuring five bassier notes with an extra octave down and a toggleable keyboard visual why am i

654
02:13:00,640 --> 02:13:05,199
like a can basically here you can play whatever you want or solo over the built-in song which i

655
02:13:05,199 --> 02:13:10,890
am not good at also the germas down here can get a little sticky for some reason i'm not sure why

656
02:13:10,890 --> 02:13:31,770
and i figured that i would tell you now with all that in mind let's take it for a spin this is

657
02:13:31,770 --> 02:15:25,720
gonna be crazy oh it's going into overdrive oh so there you have it folks the germa keyboard

658
02:15:25,720 --> 02:15:30,359
i miss this was a real challenge to make but i had a lot of fun with it so i hope you did too

659
02:15:30,359 --> 02:15:35,079
also i would love to keep improving it so if you have any suggestions for features or even

660
02:15:35,079 --> 02:15:39,949
different people i could make keyboards out of feel free to tell me in the comments also also

661
02:15:39,949 --> 02:15:47,239
i'll probably upload a cleaner version of the visuals since this looks kind of bad also also

662
02:15:47,239 --> 02:15:51,720
also this project kind of got away from me so here are some keyboard renders i made for no

663
02:15:51,720 --> 02:15:58,300
reason look at them go we okay thanks for watching bye you selling the keyboard you're selling the

664
02:15:58,300 --> 02:16:02,779
rendered keyboards and that's your opportunity to have a link to show up on screen of you selling

665
02:16:02,779 --> 02:16:15,689
the rendered keyboard like a direct link i wouldn't be able to stop you greed uh that was

666
02:16:16,489 --> 02:16:36,239
i can't believe that somebody would make this all these tools it's unbelievable here me ends

667
02:16:36,239 --> 02:16:47,690
the germa verse wait didn't we see this one did we see this one no no no no no that's i'm thinking

668
02:16:47,690 --> 02:16:50,969
of the okay hold on this is actually thank you for doing this is important because there's a

669
02:16:50,969 --> 02:17:04,809
lot of people here uh yeah i'm gonna leave this on screen for a minute and it's probably a spoiler

888
03:15:03,559 --> 03:15:12,799
the way through the videos we're not even halfway so i'm going to make the decision before we get

889
03:15:12,799 --> 03:15:20,040
any further here when we get to the halfway point there's going to be a part two we'll do a part two

890
03:15:20,040 --> 03:15:30,719
because it's going to be like five plus hours for part one and at the rate that i have been flexing

891
03:15:30,719 --> 03:15:35,399
my chest back and forth i don't think i'm going to be able to sit here for another four or five

892
03:15:35,399 --> 03:15:45,040
hours but hey we can do it again and by the way this is not going to be like oh we'll do part two

893
03:15:45,200 --> 03:15:53,079
like a month not within the next like four or five days so let's keep going we're not we're not even

894
03:15:53,079 --> 03:15:58,250
close by the way we have at least another hour plus hour maybe two hours before we get to the

895
03:15:58,250 --> 03:16:16,219
true halfway point here we go here are my dances oh by the way i don't think any of you knew that

896
03:16:16,219 --> 03:16:40,489
i could do this oh didn't think i could do that did you that's pretty that's that's real that's

you have gone through an obstacle far greater than anybody

908
03:19:54,479 --> 03:19:59,120
much older than you could even imagine going through and then you come to this point and

909
03:19:59,120 --> 03:20:03,920
you make choices and you made the choice of singing that song and it was so heartfelt and

986
03:37:42,920 --> 03:37:49,159
this time you know especially around those ears that reminds me my dog got itching ears every time

987
03:37:49,159 --> 03:37:55,079
she would scratch herself she'd howl and she'd squeal so you know what oh i decided to take it

988
03:37:55,079 --> 03:38:01,559
to the vet but instead of him fixing her itching ears he told me to go home and get a pile of her

989
03:38:01,559 --> 03:38:07,399
stool well of course we go like i couldn't imagine what does that have to do with itching ears so i

990
03:38:07,399 --> 03:38:13,000
went home well not to get the number two instead i call the veterans hospital and they tell me well

991
03:38:13,000 --> 03:38:18,520
we treat people here not dogs and that i should call the vet hospital but i said this is the vet

992
03:38:18,520 --> 03:38:20,280
hospital isn't it you know he hung up

993
03:38:29,760 --> 03:38:37,399

997
03:39:10,920 --> 03:39:17,719
i'm gonna say okay it's time for us to leave because the barber is he's on all everything he

998
03:39:17,719 --> 03:39:23,149

rooms away behind glass so you can look over and you see them playing in the glass in the club

1029
03:44:05,879 --> 03:44:11,879
and then the it's recorded inside of the glass and then they pump that whatever volume they decide

1030
03:44:11,879 --> 03:44:17,610
through a control system into the rest of the club you understand that's the perfect solution
