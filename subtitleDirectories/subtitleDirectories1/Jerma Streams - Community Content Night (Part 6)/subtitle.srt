1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:11,130
I feel like I'm in a Disney movie, where the main character comes into class, and he's late by one second, and he gets detention.

2
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:15,929
Okay, let's see what I'm talking about. He's got like books in his hands. He's like, oh no, my first day!

3
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:22,519
Sprinting down. Which one? 102? Where's 102 math? Oh shoot!

4
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:26,440
Before he drops a book on the ground, he gets in. He doesn't sit down.

5
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,699
Mr. Albertson, you're late.

6
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:32,299
Oh man.

7
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:36,890
And we don't take kindly to late students.

8
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:43,420
And I get, they get detention. Is that what's happening right now?

9
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,140
It's a JoJo reference?

10
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,840
That happens in Jo... Guys, everything happens in a TV show.

11
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:57,780
You know, just, if you have any idea how many TV shows exist, think of every second of television.

12
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,859
I'm sure what I'm saying has happened in a hundred different series.

13
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:06,299
Yeah, that was a fucking JoJo reference.

14
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:10,180
No, it's a human reference. Because people are late.

15
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:14,599
And then if people make references to human behavior in their TV shows.

16
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:16,599
I'm never watching it now.

17
00:01:18,219 --> 00:01:20,780
Wait, is that? Oh, that's a meme. Okay. Sorry. Hold on.

18
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,510
I'll be right back. See, I gotta tweet this. Be right back.

19
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:57,159
All right. So tonight we're gonna do obviously community content night.

20
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:02,620
Make sure I don't hear myself in my own microphone. Good thing I don't.

21
00:02:03,579 --> 00:02:05,579
Let's make sure I don't hear this either.

22
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:11,340
We gotta have a good OST. What's a good OST?

23
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,810
Gonna be ready for more JoJo tonight?

24
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:20,250
I have something to tell you. Those of you waiting for JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Video Files.

25
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:26,569
I don't think there's any. I think there might be one reference to it.

26
00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:32,360
I don't think there's any. This is up till March 1st, by the way.

27
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,000
So this is from late January all through February.

28
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:39,479
And we're gonna do another catch up here.

29
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,099
We're gonna do a second community content night.

30
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:48,860
Probably at some point a week or so from now.

31
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,900
And we're gonna try to catch up through March into April.

32
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,259
So then we'll be really actually caught up with community content night.

33
00:02:57,289 --> 00:02:58,490
Boomer content night.

34
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,699
I didn't like where my mic was.

35
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:09,060
I changed it.

36
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:13,319
Anyways, yeah, we have a lot of submissions.

37
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,639
A lot of stuff to go through. Gonna hang out and play.

38
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:19,400
We have a bunch of subs. AmnesticOW.

39
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:22,219
Just gave 10 community subs. Thank you Amnestic.

40
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:23,740
And The Chef's Corner.

41
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,659
I feel like the last few nights, last three or four streams,

42
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:31,259
The Chef's Corner has opened us up with at least five to ten community subs.

43
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:32,620
So thank you. It's a lot.

44
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:34,659
Thanks both of you.

45
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:39,770
I missed the pre-stream chat. PepeHands, it's okay.

46
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:40,810
There'll be plenty more.

47
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,789
So tomorrow, after we do this,

48
00:03:45,349 --> 00:03:49,509
tomorrow is gonna be public domain movie night.

49
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:51,110
And I have a few things to say about that.

50
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:55,430
So we're gonna start with The Gorilla.

51
00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:02,020
The Gorilla is a public domain movie from 1939 about a killer gorilla.

52
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:07,110
Apparently the movie sucks total ass.

53
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,840
And it's only an hour long.

54
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,319
This full movie is one hour long.

55
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,840
So we're gonna be watching another one too.

56
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,019
I'm trying not to look too hard into this movie.

57
00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:28,220
But I've heard that it's a horror comedy, if you could believe it.

58
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,470
And we're gonna open with it.

59
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,629
And we have to watch the whole thing. That's part of this.

60
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:36,470
We don't get to skip anything. We don't get to change anything.

61
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,629
We have to stay there and watch it for the hour.

62
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:40,629
Well, you don't have to, but I do.

63
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:41,589
Because it's my stream.

64
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,740
It's like, if you think it's stupid, you're like,

65
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,180
no, I'm fucking out of here. That's fine.

66
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,379
I have to watch the whole thing.

67
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:50,899
So we'll see.

68
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,660
But I'll have a second one queued up after that, which will be a mystery movie.

69
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,230
I was speaking of more subs.

70
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:01,459
Nondescript Civilian and Neftwitch.

71
00:05:02,709 --> 00:05:05,269
Nondescript gave 10 community subs.

72
00:05:05,269 --> 00:05:07,589
And Neftwitch gave five community subs.

73
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,589
30 community subs have come in in like the last 30 seconds.

74
00:05:13,589 --> 00:05:14,149
Thanks, guys.

75
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,319
Vod viewers will skip.

76
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:23,339
The one time we're being a VOD viewer is like, whoa, you got an advantage here.

77
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,699
Telling you.

78
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:31,930
Play Yoshi's Island OST. Yeah, we gotta get a good OST.

79
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,639
Let's do an OST that we haven't done like a thousand times.

80
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:44,120
We keep doing Yoshi's Story and stuff.

81
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,699
Invader is another five community subs.

82
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:52,980
Thanks for another five.

83
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,939
It makes like 40 or 30 or 50.

84
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,579
I can't even keep track. There's just so many.

85
00:05:58,579 --> 00:06:00,259
You guys give so much money to this stream.

86
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:01,300
It's fucking insane.

87
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,610
Mario Galaxy.

88
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,769
Mario Galaxy is too upbeat, I think.

89
00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:07,610
Mario Galaxy is like...

90
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:13,050
That's too...

91
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:14,730
I don't want to be so energetic.

92
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:17,610
I need to be relaxed and hanging out.

93
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:21,720
Sonic Rush.

94
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,519
No, that's too much.

95
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:23,000
That's too...

96
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,040
That's a heavy guitar.

97
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,000
I don't want a heavy guitar.

98
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:30,420
Hollow Knight.

99
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:32,629
Now, that's...

100
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:39,509
That's interesting to me right now.

101
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:40,550
Hollow Knight OST.

102
00:06:41,589 --> 00:06:43,980
Oh, let's check it out.

103
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:51,910
Okay.

104
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:57,000
Hey, Aiden, thanks for the five community subs.

105
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:00,389
It's like a little too fast, though.

106
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:01,189
Is there a slow part?

107
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:04,089
It's too upbeat for me.

108
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,769
I feel like I'm going to fight with somebody.

109
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:08,410
No, not too...

110
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:13,420
All right, let's start here.

111
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:14,949
All right, yeah.

112
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:16,310
Here we go.

113
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,269
That's the busted up one.

114
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:17,589
All right.

115
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:19,990
So, we're going to move on here.

116
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:22,839
To a...

117
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:25,910
This thing.

118
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:29,129
And move on to this thing.

119
00:07:29,689 --> 00:07:33,269
There's no PC game on.

120
00:07:33,269 --> 00:07:34,149
Let's move over here.

121
00:07:34,149 --> 00:07:35,110
Hey, look at that.

122
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:38,810
I already got one.

123
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:40,490
Is this a JoJo reference?

124
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:41,529
Did I say no JoJo?

125
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:42,250
Is this a JoJo?

126
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:45,860
No, it's not.

127
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,540
This is not a JoJo reference.

128
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,180
Not everything is a...

129
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,220
That's too fast.

130
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,170
Not everything is a JoJo's reference.

131
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,730
Why am I saying JoJo's like it's a family restaurant?

132
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:04,230
Come on down to JoJo's.

133
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:09,269
Fried fish and a side of sweet potatoes.

134
00:08:09,269 --> 00:08:10,629
Only $9.99.

135
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:16,379
All right, let's go.

136
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:19,500
Once I turn this on, I can't turn it off, right?

137
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,459
I hope I'm not naked.

138
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:20,699
Okay.

139
00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:25,610
Once this is on, it can't turn off.

140
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:28,500
That's too...

141
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,300
That's too fast.

142
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:30,579
Oh, hold on.

143
00:08:31,939 --> 00:08:33,940
It's got zits all over me.

144
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:34,340
It's been...

145
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:34,820
All right.

146
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,220
It's off.

147
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:35,779
I'm turning it off.

148
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:39,720
No, this is too fast.

149
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:41,240
Here we go.

150
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,029
How do you like better lighting?

151
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:49,240
Oh, the light's on.

152
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,740
Don't make fun of my hair.

153
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,620
It's like all fucked up.

154
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,620
I haven't had a haircut in like two months, three months.

155
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,179
I can't...

156
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,019
Somebody just give 20 subs.

157
00:08:56,019 --> 00:08:56,259
Hold on.

158
00:08:56,259 --> 00:08:58,340
Let me fix this fucking bad video.

159
00:08:59,059 --> 00:09:05,990
Somebody just give 20 community subs right now.

160
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:09,669
Blast Master just gave 20 subs.

161
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:12,899
Thank you, Blast Master.

162
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,409
I know.

163
00:09:14,409 --> 00:09:14,730
It's like...

164
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,250
It got like wispy hairs.

165
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,409
Usually the stylist like...

166
00:09:18,409 --> 00:09:21,129
Yeah, and I had a little bit of a problem this morning with my finger.

167
00:09:22,009 --> 00:09:22,809
I got it cut.

168
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:24,169
Yeah, look at that.

169
00:09:24,169 --> 00:09:26,009
Look at this like big flap of hair.

170
00:09:28,629 --> 00:09:29,909
It's all wrong.

171
00:09:29,909 --> 00:09:30,710
It's all wrong.

172
00:09:31,429 --> 00:09:32,950
I'm gonna do it like this.

173
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:35,460
I cut...

174
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,940
This is from a hummus container, by the way.

175
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,500
I slid my finger already to open the hummus container

176
00:09:41,899 --> 00:09:41,980
and I just...

177
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,179
I slipped my finger open.

178
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,009
It was a disaster.

179
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:47,379
All right.

180
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:47,860
Let me...

181
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,259
Hold on.

182
00:09:48,259 --> 00:09:50,259
Before we get started, I gotta fix this.

183
00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:51,899
Like shit.

184
00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:55,000
Give me that back.

185
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,779
Auto-focus is on too.

186
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:04,059
What the fuck is this bullshit?

187
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:12,309
How do people...

188
00:10:12,309 --> 00:10:12,710
How does it...

189
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:21,830
White balance is wrong too.

190
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,100
It's fine.

191
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:29,500
Whatever.

192
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,220
Like I don't care.

193
00:10:31,179 --> 00:10:32,460
When I turn to the side, you're gonna see.

194
00:10:33,419 --> 00:10:35,100
Like this is what it's gonna be like.

195
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,940
So what the fuck do I care?

196
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:39,259
And I know it looks like somebody like...

197
00:10:39,259 --> 00:10:41,899
Put like melted chocolate on my head.

198
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:43,019
But that's just the way it is.

199
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:43,899
And that's the way it's gonna be.

200
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,820
Somebody just gave a huge amount of money.

201
00:10:49,659 --> 00:10:51,019
Somebody's just like just...

202
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:53,419
This is like a cake decoration here.

203
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:53,980
I get it.

204
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:54,299
I know.

205
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:55,980
You don't think I look in the mirror

206
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,820
and don't think I see like a decorated cake?

207
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:03,370
Anyways, we had a lot of money just come in.

208
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:03,769
We had...

209
00:11:04,649 --> 00:11:05,940
How much did we just have come in?

210
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,740
10,000 bits just came in.

211
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:11,830
By West.

212
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:16,549
West 095 just gave a fucking hundred bucks.

213
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:17,190
And they don't...

214
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:17,429
This...

215
00:11:17,429 --> 00:11:17,990
They don't...

216
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,629
There's nothing here.

217
00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:20,149
It's just a hundred dollars.

218
00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:21,190
It's just a hundred dollars.

219
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,110
It's a huge amount of fucking money.

220
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,750
Thank you, West.

221
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:27,269
Thank you.

222
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,429
Bad Nutrition 5 Community Subs as well.

223
00:11:29,429 --> 00:11:30,789
You guys are just giving me money.

224
00:11:30,789 --> 00:11:32,070
And anybody even here?

225
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:33,590
There's zero viewers right now.

226
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,080
And nobody even here.

227
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,769
How can I know reliably that people are actually even here?

228
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:39,690
Like how am I supposed to...

229
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:40,889
How am I supposed to determine with my...

230
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:42,009
What my analytics look like?

231
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,419
Lip cream hair.

232
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:49,399
All right.

233
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:49,960
Let's get started.

234
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:53,860
I'm going to shrink myself a little bit.

235
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,809
Nobody...

236
00:11:56,809 --> 00:11:58,409
There's another hundred fucking dollars.

237
00:11:59,299 --> 00:12:01,220
A hundred more dollars.

238
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,580
This is like five...

239
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:06,419
This is like four or five hundred dollars in 15 minutes.

240
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:08,230
Holy shit.

241
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:08,470
Okay.

242
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:08,710
That's...

243
00:12:10,149 --> 00:12:10,629
Boz...

244
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:12,620
Boz...

245
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,220
Bertlar.

246
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:16,940
Boz Bertlar gave a hundred dollars.

247
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,700
Greetings from Sweden.

248
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,379
Hello from the United States of America.

249
00:12:20,379 --> 00:12:21,580
Specifically, the Las Vegas.

250
00:12:23,019 --> 00:12:25,110
Now they say long time viewer, first time donator.

251
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,629
Oh, and also play Yakuza Zero.

252
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:27,110
I already did.

253
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:31,190
And I gave up on it because I have the attention span of a fucking eight-year-old.

254
00:12:32,379 --> 00:12:34,460
But thanks for the huge amount of fucking money.

255
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,279
All right.

256
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:39,240
We got our first Joe Joe's Bizarre Adventure reference.

257
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:40,840
Hey, Tona.

258
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,879
Thanks for the 10 subs.

259
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:42,120
Yeah.

260
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:42,519
I'll just...

261
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:44,440
I'll just bring it at five hundred dollars.

262
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:46,330
Holy shit, guys.

263
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,940
You're out of your minds.

264
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,509
We got Glue Man and the Rat.

265
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,509
And of course, yeah, in the background.

266
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:54,549
This is very well done.

267
00:12:54,549 --> 00:12:56,950
Not to say the last one wasn't well done.

268
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,149
But this one's very good.

269
00:12:58,789 --> 00:13:00,519
But on clown music.

270
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:05,990
What do you mean clown music?

271
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:11,659
Oh, no, the Rat got confirmed for Smash.

272
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:18,330
Clown, clown, clown, clown.

273
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,610
I don't...

274
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:20,330
Clown...

275
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:20,809
I don't get it.

276
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:24,940
What is clown OST?

277
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:25,740
That doesn't make any sense.

278
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,460
Clown OST.

279
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,500
The first thing that comes up is the Joker movie.

280
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,809
There's no clown OST.

281
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,850
A clown doesn't have a CD that he puts in

282
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:42,009
when he goes and does balloon animals at your house.

283
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:43,610
By the way, I got to like...

284
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,519
I got to get a little close to this microphone

285
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:47,080
so you can hear me.

286
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,480
We got to change where the webcam is too.

287
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:49,960
All right, there we go.

288
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,720
All right, what's what?

289
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,600
Clown OST.

290
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,840
I don't get it.

291
00:13:55,399 --> 00:14:01,350
I'm not putting on the Joker.

292
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,309
I haven't seen that movie.

293
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:05,059
Play clown music.

294
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:07,610
I don't even know what you taught.

295
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,210
What is that even supposed to mean?

296
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:09,850
Clown...

297
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,049
One hour of...

298
00:14:11,049 --> 00:14:11,929
I'm not putting...

299
00:14:11,929 --> 00:14:15,159
No, circus theme song for 10 hours.

300
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:18,950
It's even lined up, really.

301
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:21,529
I got to get out of the way

302
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:22,490
so you can see the whole picture.

303
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:29,879
Do it.

304
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:33,769
I don't want to just put on fucking clown music.

305
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,080
No, I'm not going to keep this on.

306
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,120
This is fucking stupid.

307
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,799
How about just like...

308
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,889
One hour of scary clown music.

309
00:14:47,769 --> 00:14:49,769
One hour of creepy clown music.

310
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,899
45 minutes of classic circus music.

311
00:14:58,899 --> 00:14:59,860
I think I've already played this.

312
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:05,019
Yeah, yeah, I've played this before.

313
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:12,409
Okay, I'm going to do this as long as I can possibly handle this.

314
00:15:12,409 --> 00:15:13,210
But that's it.

315
00:15:13,929 --> 00:15:15,539
But this is fantastic, though.

316
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:16,019
Nice work.

317
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,399
Ah, this is scary.

318
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,450
It's me.

319
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,210
Looks like I've got a knife in my hand.

320
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:30,379
I...

321
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:34,259
Why is it happening twice again?

322
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:36,870
Why is this happening?

323
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:37,830
I changed my thing.

324
00:15:40,549 --> 00:15:40,870
That's...

325
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,309
Hello?

326
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:43,190
What the fuck?

327
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:47,129
Okay, hold on.

328
00:15:47,129 --> 00:15:48,549
Here we go.

329
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:54,299
There we are.

330
00:15:54,299 --> 00:15:56,409
Now we got some real clown music going.

331
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:00,330
I like the knife.

332
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,649
I like the knife work that you've got here.

333
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:07,750
We can't hear it.

334
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:10,809
Yes, you can.

335
00:16:10,809 --> 00:16:15,190
What's going on up here?

336
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:15,830
Is this blood?

337
00:16:16,549 --> 00:16:17,590
Oh, I...

338
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:17,830
Why?

339
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:18,549
How do I not...

340
00:16:18,549 --> 00:16:19,429
This is the spy.

341
00:16:19,429 --> 00:16:20,629
That's your eternal reward.

342
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:21,590
How do I not know this?

343
00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:25,100
It was disguised.

344
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:25,419
Okay.

345
00:16:26,059 --> 00:16:26,779
I don't know why.

346
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:28,220
I'm so fucking dumb.

347
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,070
I'm a fool.

348
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:30,389
I know.

349
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:33,110
Ah, this is somebody...

350
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:35,509
Somebody had a birthday or somebody had a...

351
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:37,029
All right.

352
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:37,590
Somebody had a...

353
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,669
There was a baby involved or something.

354
00:16:39,669 --> 00:16:41,029
There was a baby reveal.

355
00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:41,429
I don't know.

356
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:46,759
But this is...

357
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:47,320
That's a joke.

358
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:47,960
Wait, that's from the...

359
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:55,129
I don't...

360
00:16:55,129 --> 00:16:56,730
I've never said I haven't seen the movie.

361
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,370
This is a joker of game?

362
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:00,009
It's a game.

363
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:03,639
This is a good image.

364
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:03,879
You got...

365
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:04,279
Hey, look.

366
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:09,220
Those of you that don't know,

367
00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:12,740
I don't wear two headphones

368
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:14,900
because when I cover both my ears,

369
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,180
I don't know where I am.

370
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,140
And it fucks with my spatial awareness.

371
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:19,539
When I...

372
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,299
I say I can't hear myself talk right now.

373
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:24,019
And me not being able to hear myself talk right now

374
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,500
is being drowned out by like clown music.

375
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,700
So it's like when a vacuum cleaner is on

376
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,339
and you're talking,

377
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,920
I can't do it.

378
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,400
I can't do it.

379
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,200
I have to be able to hear...

380
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,759
I have to be able to hear and sense the surroundings.

381
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:38,519
Otherwise, I lose my mind.

382
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,559
But no, this is pretty accurate.

383
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,619
Yo, that's the old hair too.

384
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,430
All right.

385
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,470
One in the chat,

386
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,990
if you want me to go back to short,

387
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,869
free Vegas hair.

388
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:54,660
Who in the chat if you want me to let this grow

389
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,619
and don't cut it for at least three years?

390
00:18:04,619 --> 00:18:06,940
Eh, I've seen a lot of ones.

391
00:18:07,579 --> 00:18:11,539
Or three is shave it off.

392
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,079
I can't listen to that song a fourth time.

393
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:15,480
I'm sorry.

394
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:15,960
We have to do something.

395
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,920
We have to put something else on.

396
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,539
Yoshi's.

397
00:18:20,539 --> 00:18:20,940
What was it?

398
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,819
Yoshi's story.

399
00:18:21,819 --> 00:18:22,539
We keep going.

400
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:25,420
We always go back to like Yoshi's Island.

401
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:28,660
To a pole.

402
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,460
No, no, no.

403
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,099
I'm not going to be like,

404
00:18:30,099 --> 00:18:31,220
oh, should I cut my hair?

405
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,220
Should I dye it fucking orange

406
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,740
or should I cut it off?

407
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,940
No, no, no, no, no, no.

408
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,299
I'm going to decide what I'm...

409
00:18:37,299 --> 00:18:38,579
Cut my finger by the way today.

410
00:18:38,579 --> 00:18:39,700
Of course you see that.

411
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,930
To a mohawk.

412
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:42,430
No.

413
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:46,410
Why did you ask?

414
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:49,750
I just...

415
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,029
I was just seeing what people thought.

416
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:55,690
I said, hey, one in chat if you think.

417
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:56,650
Two in chat if you think.

418
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:58,170
But what you...

419
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,210
It's what I think though.

420
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:00,009
Because it's my hair.

421
00:19:00,569 --> 00:19:01,849
I was just curious to see how many people

422
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:02,650
would be angry with it.

423
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:10,140
Jerma doesn't think.

424
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,990
All right.

425
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,430
We're going to do Yoshi's.

426
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:14,630
Yoshi's story.

427
00:19:15,509 --> 00:19:16,630
What's the one for Nintendo 64

428
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:17,829
where they sing like little kids?

429
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:19,109
They go...

430
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,130
Where is it?

431
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:23,930
It's horrendous.

432
00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:25,529
Here it comes.

433
00:19:26,329 --> 00:19:30,200
I remember playing this when I was younger.

434
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:31,960
When I was younger,

435
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,240
it wasn't that long ago but it was.

436
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:36,440
And it's this ear piercing like...

437
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,880
I'm telling you it's horrible.

438
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,359
Where is it?

439
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:42,819
No.

440
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,309
Not this one.

441
00:19:48,779 --> 00:19:49,259
Where is it?

442
00:19:50,619 --> 00:19:50,859
It's...

443
00:19:50,859 --> 00:19:51,980
Then they say the end.

444
00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:56,950
The end of...

445
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:01,109
The end of...

446
00:20:01,109 --> 00:20:02,230
Like it's the end of the story.

447
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,059
What's it called?

448
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:15,670
How come I can't find it?

449
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:18,259
Nintendo.

450
00:20:18,339 --> 00:20:18,900
On the beach.

451
00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:20,420
Love is in the air.

452
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,660
Tough guys don't cry.

453
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,779
What's that one?

454
00:20:23,779 --> 00:20:37,460
It's the rat found in the sewer.

455
00:20:38,259 --> 00:20:39,460
The small enemy spider.

456
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:43,160
That's supposed to be me?

457
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:48,150
Chad is a cutie.

458
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,109
Is that supposed to be you?

459
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,220
The garbage-filled baby arms

460
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:56,180
are because I drew on one layer unintentionally.

461
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,859
Didn't want to start over like a dum-dum.

462
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,819
What's wrong with it?

463
00:20:59,819 --> 00:21:00,140
It's fine.

464
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,140
What's wrong with it?

465
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:03,619
It looks good.

466
00:21:04,259 --> 00:21:05,990
I think it looks good.

467
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:13,910
Trust no one, not even yourself.

468
00:21:20,009 --> 00:21:21,450
This is just my regular clothes.

469
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:28,309
I wear like the same three superhero shirts

470
00:21:28,309 --> 00:21:29,109
and then like a few...

471
00:21:29,109 --> 00:21:30,710
A handful of Star Wars shirts.

472
00:21:35,349 --> 00:21:37,509
Jax has a way better fashion sense as you can see.

473
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:40,410
He's got a Nightwing shirt on.

474
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:41,450
That's it.

475
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:42,890
Wow.

476
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,690
Also a superhero shirt.

477
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:50,539
Do I have any real clothes?

478
00:21:50,539 --> 00:21:52,140
I do, but they just all...

479
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:52,460
Okay.

480
00:21:53,339 --> 00:21:54,950
I have real clothes,

481
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:58,150
but they're all hung up on hangers

482
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,150
and I don't ever take them off the hangers

483
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:02,549
because it's way easier just to put a t-shirt on

484
00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:05,190
than it is to like put a button-up shirt with like a tie on.

485
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:09,769
Prove it.

486
00:22:09,769 --> 00:22:12,019
Prove that I have real clothes?

487
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:18,460
No, it has nothing to do with going to Reddit.

488
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,259
It has to do with...

489
00:22:19,259 --> 00:22:19,660
I don't...

490
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:21,339
I like having...

491
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:22,940
It's comfy.

492
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:24,900
Do it.

493
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,180
Let's do a fashion show.

494
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,339
Hold that thought.

495
00:22:28,339 --> 00:22:31,140
We got community fucking content tonight.

496
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,339
Although it's kind of still the day.

497
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,539
I'll prove it.

498
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:33,859
I will.

499
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,019
Life imitates art.

500
00:22:36,579 --> 00:22:48,220
It sure does.

501
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:51,349
Jerma and Jax.

502
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:54,839
Pretty cool dudes here.

503
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:04,279
Is this it?

504
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:07,029
No.

505
00:23:07,029 --> 00:23:07,910
I thought that was going to be it.

506
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:08,630
I was waiting for it.

507
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:11,509
Well, there's Jax and Jerma.

508
00:23:11,509 --> 00:23:12,950
We're both not the same person.

509
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:13,670
We both have different...

510
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:15,990
We're both different people, I guess.

511
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:17,910
I skipped it already.

512
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:18,869
How is that even possible?

513
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:21,559
By the way, take this out.

514
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:22,279
I can't even...

515
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:23,400
I can't even hear myself talk.

516
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:25,160
I need no headphones.

517
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,759
You know, I know people that put both headphones in

518
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:30,519
and pump their audio through,

519
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:31,640
so they hear themselves talking.

520
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:33,799
I would throw up if I had to do that.

521
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,480
I would actually throw up.

522
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,000
Like, I would...

523
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:39,720
It would never work.

524
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:41,160
It would be impossible.

525
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,180
This looks like a sticker to me.

526
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,559
Looks very good.

527
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:49,259
The big thick outlines.

528
00:23:49,259 --> 00:23:52,089
I like it.

529
00:23:52,089 --> 00:23:54,650
I would love this on the back of a laptop.

530
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:58,059
Get your laptop.

531
00:23:59,180 --> 00:23:59,819
I think it would look good.

532
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,269
It would look good.

533
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:03,269
Like a Redditor.

534
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:07,190
Not everything is...

535
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:10,230
You guys are on that recently.

536
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:10,950
I don't understand.

537
00:24:11,829 --> 00:24:16,630
Not everything is based on a news aggregate website.

538
00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:23,539
How come you guys aren't like...

539
00:24:23,539 --> 00:24:23,940
Oh, wow.

540
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,380
That's a real CNN thing to do.

541
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:27,059
Oh, wow.

542
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:28,019
NBC streamer.

543
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:30,410
Nice NBC room.

544
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,640
I get my news from Reddit.

545
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,400
I read the headlines and see and go to articles on Reddit.

546
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:39,960
That's like calling me an NBC guy.

547
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:41,160
Or like a...

548
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:41,559
Wow, man.

549
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:43,400
That's what a real NBC thing to do, huh?

550
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,039
Oh, yeah.

551
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:45,480
I'm going to have a laptop with a sticker on it.

552
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,599
What are you, fucking CNN?

553
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:49,799
I just only go to Reddit for news.

554
00:24:53,509 --> 00:24:54,549
That explains a lot.

555
00:24:54,549 --> 00:24:55,269
No, it doesn't.

556
00:24:55,269 --> 00:24:55,750
I don't even...

557
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,029
Guys, I don't even watch TV.

558
00:24:58,069 --> 00:24:59,269
I don't even watch TV.

559
00:25:00,309 --> 00:25:01,960
I don't watch television.

560
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,480
I don't listen to music.

561
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,680
I'm just a fucking weirdo.

562
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,359
I just sit in a room and stare at a wall.

563
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,119
I just go like this.

564
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:11,079
Wow, I make up my own TV shows.

565
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,200
I like my own characters.

566
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,119
And I let them do their own things in my head.

567
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,390
I just said that to everybody.

568
00:25:20,339 --> 00:25:21,220
This is pretty scary.

569
00:25:22,859 --> 00:25:23,579
You're a psycho?

570
00:25:23,579 --> 00:25:25,259
No, it's called free entertainment.

571
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:32,970
I can't wait to the next episode of two alligators.

572
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:34,730
Because that's the thing I dreamed last night.

573
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:35,529
Two alligators.

574
00:25:36,809 --> 00:25:37,369
Made that up.

575
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:38,920
I did.

576
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:39,799
I did.

577
00:25:40,619 --> 00:25:41,019
Yeah.

578
00:25:41,019 --> 00:25:41,500
Good call.

579
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:41,900
Good catch.

580
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:50,730
Two and a half alligators.

581
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,599
This is scary.

582
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:56,579
I like the background, though.

583
00:25:56,579 --> 00:26:02,859
Looks good.

584
00:26:02,859 --> 00:26:04,140
Big screaming mouth.

585
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:05,900
Look at this guy.

586
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,140
Yeah.

587
00:26:06,859 --> 00:26:10,710
Why are people saying sour please?

588
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:11,109
What is it?

589
00:26:11,109 --> 00:26:12,069
I don't want to miss out.

590
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:13,190
What is it?

591
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:22,809
Why are we sour pleasing the language?

592
00:26:22,809 --> 00:26:24,170
Sneaking around music.

593
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:24,809
That's what this is.

594
00:26:24,809 --> 00:26:26,170
This is the evil guy.

595
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,849
It's sneaking around corners.

596
00:26:27,849 --> 00:26:28,569
This is like the...

597
00:26:28,569 --> 00:26:28,970
Hold on.

598
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:33,480
This is this music.

599
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:33,799
All righty?

600
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:35,240
Like I'm going to come in frame.

601
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:56,460
Where's the end?

602
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,099
985.

603
00:26:59,099 --> 00:27:00,539
A story of a madman.

604
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:08,250
Now that was another good internet clown moment.

605
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:09,849
Thank you.

606
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:12,549
I'm not even...

607
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:13,670
These are all like jokes.

608
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:15,740
All right.

609
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,859
I can't hear myself breathe.

610
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,000
These are all like jokes.

611
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,720
I'm not a madman.

612
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,200
This is okay.

613
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:20,920
This is a character.

614
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,799
This is Odd Michael.

615
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,119
This is me crying and laughing at a fart compilation.

616
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:26,599
So that's me.

617
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:28,359
That's also me.

618
00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:31,180
That's not even me.

619
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,140
That's Jex.

620
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:34,710
That's a TIE fighter guy.

621
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:35,930
That's a clown.

622
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:36,490
That's not even me.

623
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:37,049
That's a clown.

624
00:27:37,049 --> 00:27:39,049
And then this is a ninja turtle.

625
00:27:39,609 --> 00:27:40,460
So sorry.

626
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:40,940
These are all...

627
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,059
These are characters.

628
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:44,619
What's that old saying?

629
00:27:44,619 --> 00:27:46,619
I'm not a doctor, but I play one on TV.

630
00:27:46,619 --> 00:27:47,319
This is...

631
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:48,279
These are characters of mine.

632
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:49,240
This is not me.

633
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,869
Socrates.

634
00:27:53,829 --> 00:27:54,869
You're a character.

635
00:27:54,869 --> 00:27:58,420
Post fart.

636
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,779
Thanks for the five subs.

637
00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:02,619
Oh, so you're a scientist.

638
00:28:02,619 --> 00:28:04,660
No, I'm not a scientist.

639
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:05,539
I love this.

640
00:28:05,539 --> 00:28:07,259
This is great.

641
00:28:09,769 --> 00:28:11,380
Getting defensive.

642
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:14,819
Not really.

643
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:22,059
He's really happy about something.

644
00:28:22,059 --> 00:28:24,599
And I do appreciate the big ding on the teeth.

645
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:26,440
I like the ding.

646
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,400
Whatever.

647
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,279
I don't even know what the song is.

648
00:28:35,609 --> 00:28:37,930
Here's some Dunky Donut because you're epic.

649
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:39,049
That really took off, too.

650
00:28:41,369 --> 00:28:43,130
This Dunkin' Donuts thing.

651
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:48,470
Isn't this like a meme from somebody else?

652
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:49,829
This is like another meme, right?

653
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:53,460
This is like...

654
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,500
We've adapted.

655
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,900
We've taken over and adapted the meme.

656
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:05,130
Oh, I didn't, but this is a Reddit meme.

657
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:07,369
No, it's not.

658
00:29:07,369 --> 00:29:12,950
It's not...

659
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:13,349
No, it's not.

660
00:29:13,349 --> 00:29:13,910
It's not mine.

661
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,140
Nothing.

662
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,019
None of this is mine.

663
00:29:17,019 --> 00:29:17,980
This is all yours.

664
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,259
This is community content night.

665
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:21,180
I almost just burped because it was loud in the microphone.

666
00:29:25,859 --> 00:29:28,660
Told you how I got this cut from a hummus.

667
00:29:30,259 --> 00:29:33,779
When you eat a lot of hummus, it can boil back up.

668
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:38,309
It can be like gas because of all the hummus gas.

669
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,630
So I'm not a scientist.

670
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:44,140
I don't watch any news.

671
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:44,619
No, I do.

672
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:51,660
This is interesting because this person is Tony Hawk's underground.

673
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:54,549
And they've decided to use that.

674
00:29:56,019 --> 00:30:07,109
This is the image that all of us have when our parents took the picture of us on our

675
00:30:07,109 --> 00:30:08,549
first day of school in first grade.

676
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:17,910
In fact, I could probably ask my mother to send me the picture of this exact thing I'm

677
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:18,470
talking about.

678
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:21,430
Even the stance too.

679
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:22,630
The only thing is at a backpack.

680
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,099
With huge shoes.

681
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,500
They are.

682
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,960
They are fucking huge, aren't they?

683
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:40,519
Oh my god.

684
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:41,079
All right.

685
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:45,259
I wasn't going to include this, but I just did it anyways.

686
00:30:45,259 --> 00:30:49,980
I was going to just remove this one, but it's just, it's stupid.

687
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,339
I just had to put it in.

688
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:55,829
Here is, uh, I believe that's fireman.

689
00:30:55,829 --> 00:30:58,779
Clown shoes.

690
00:30:59,579 --> 00:31:04,940
I don't, I know everything has to be clown related.

691
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:07,339
Why can everything not be clown related?

692
00:31:07,339 --> 00:31:07,980
EOS.

693
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:08,380
What?

694
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:19,660
For a second, I thought it was going to be a dick and it was a clown.

695
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,380
I'm like, no, this is what you're talking about.

696
00:31:23,859 --> 00:31:24,819
Are links still banned?

697
00:31:24,819 --> 00:31:25,779
I think they are.

698
00:31:25,779 --> 00:31:32,329
It's a clown reddit Jojo.

699
00:31:32,329 --> 00:31:33,769
Anime villain goblin face.

700
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:36,390
This is from, uh, sins.

701
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:36,869
I know.

702
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:43,700
Saw this last time.

703
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:49,240
Fucking like this so much.

704
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,759
It's going to be my new profile picture.

705
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:58,440
Should this just be the profile, my profile picture?

706
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:07,190
I feel like that's not going to help me though.

707
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:07,589
Anywhere.

708
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:12,220
It would be the other one.

709
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:13,460
No.

710
00:32:14,259 --> 00:32:15,740
Are my eyes close together?

711
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,509
They kind of are.

712
00:32:21,859 --> 00:32:23,059
Yeah, kind of, but not.

713
00:32:23,059 --> 00:32:26,980
No, it's because I just got a, I got a big broken fucked up nose.

714
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:34,599
My like big ridge of my nose makes my eyes look closer together.

715
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:42,970
If I didn't have like a big like squidward schnoz, but I just, I would, it would be fine.

716
00:32:45,269 --> 00:32:45,990
Bad music.

717
00:32:53,509 --> 00:32:55,589
Oh, that's why everyone was doing that emo.

718
00:33:00,099 --> 00:33:03,380
Hey, I thought you were saying that's what I looked like.

719
00:33:04,099 --> 00:33:05,319
I thought it was.

720
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:05,559
Yeah.

721
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:06,920
You look like this character.

722
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,240
Oh yeah.

723
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,240
Like your eyes are too close together and your nose is too big.

724
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:13,799
You look like an orc streamer.

725
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:14,200
God.

726
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:17,240
It's both.

727
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:22,119
Hold the music for a second.

728
00:33:22,119 --> 00:33:24,359
We had two huge donations coming.

729
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:27,319
We had 5,000 bits from West.

730
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:28,200
Oh nine five.

731
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,759
They say I forgot the message.

732
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:32,119
So here's more bits.

733
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,950
Thanks for the years of entertainment.

734
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:37,269
Watched you since I was in like seventh grade.

735
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:39,029
That's so long.

736
00:33:39,029 --> 00:33:39,829
I'm so old.

737
00:33:40,549 --> 00:33:42,660
And I'm currently in college.

738
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,099
God, that makes me fucking old.

739
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:48,809
That makes me, that makes me ancient.

740
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:53,130
Thanks so much for making a lot of otherwise boring days.

741
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:54,650
Not boring, especially in a time like this.

742
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:55,690
Well, thanks for the $50.

743
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,819
I'm incredibly happy to have raised you.

744
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:05,779
My son, you're in the seventh, you're in the seventh grade.

745
00:34:09,579 --> 00:34:11,739
You see your kids get all off to college.

746
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:14,630
You speak such a big boy now.

747
00:34:15,269 --> 00:34:19,579
But seriously, thank you.

748
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:22,170
Thanks for the $50.

749
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:23,769
Thanks for watching for that long.

750
00:34:23,769 --> 00:34:27,900
We also had another 5,000 bits come in.

751
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,579
$50 from a big boy.

752
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,539
She's gotten so big.

753
00:34:32,539 --> 00:34:33,340
My big boy.

754
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,619
I didn't even read that.

755
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:36,139
A big boy Ego.

756
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,099
Germany streams mean a whole lot to me

757
00:34:39,099 --> 00:34:42,059
and have made me smile during some really harsh times.

758
00:34:42,059 --> 00:34:44,219
Hope you're doing well and I hope you have a nice day.

759
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:47,179
Also, please make a sequel to Demon Lord Freddy's.

760
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:52,949
I can't adhere to that request.

761
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:54,630
I can't do that.

762
00:34:57,769 --> 00:34:58,250
I can't.

763
00:34:59,449 --> 00:35:00,460
I can't.

764
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,500
That's like that's...

765
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,219
I know people say,

766
00:35:02,219 --> 00:35:03,659
Jeremy, that video is not even that bad.

767
00:35:03,659 --> 00:35:04,460
You're overreacting.

768
00:35:05,849 --> 00:35:06,650
I know.

769
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:08,489
But they'll never...

770
00:35:08,489 --> 00:35:08,989
No.

771
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,199
Need to return that money then.

772
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:19,420
No.

773
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,860
All sales are final.

774
00:35:21,929 --> 00:35:23,530
All sales are final.

775
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:25,989
Speaking of sales, thanks Super Bruce.

776
00:35:25,989 --> 00:35:27,590
Oh, Super Bruce.

777
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:28,630
Super Frog Bruce.

778
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,550
Thanks for the five community subs.

779
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,059
Is that written down anywhere by the way?

780
00:35:34,059 --> 00:35:35,900
Do I say all sales are final anywhere?

781
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:38,760
Probably should.

782
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:44,699
But anyways, that's $50 from two different people.

783
00:35:44,699 --> 00:35:46,619
Thank you West and thank you big boy.

784
00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:47,420
Both of you.

785
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:51,420
And thanks Super Frog for those five community subs.

786
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:53,219
Keep going.

787
00:35:53,219 --> 00:35:54,579
Let's put that fucking music back on.

788
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,420
Can I find the end thing?

789
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,789
Is this it?

790
00:35:59,909 --> 00:36:09,190
Guys, I think they omitted this because it was so annoying.

791
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,980
Yoshi's Story, the end.

792
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:16,699
It's not on here.

793
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:24,650
No, they removed it.

794
00:36:25,369 --> 00:36:26,250
Nobody has it anywhere.

795
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:28,599
The end of...

796
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:33,139
End credits music?

797
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,469
No, it's been removed.

798
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,480
Another 10 subs.

799
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,239
Harold Albertson, 985.

800
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:47,400
Thanks, thanks me for the 10 community subs.

801
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,260
Thank you, Harold.

802
00:36:50,059 --> 00:36:54,170
That's 10 subs.

803
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:54,969
Where the fuck is this?

804
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:57,349
A book opens.

805
00:36:57,909 --> 00:36:58,789
It's the intro.

806
00:36:58,789 --> 00:36:59,750
I had the right song?

807
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:16,199
No, it's not.

808
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:22,230
I have no idea.

809
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:25,769
I can't stop worrying about the song.

810
00:37:26,889 --> 00:37:28,090
This fucking picture.

811
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:28,730
Look at this shit.

812
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:29,210
Look at how...

813
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:30,570
This is fucking...

814
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:31,449
I want to be this.

815
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,199
I want to be this.

816
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:34,679
So bad.

817
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:40,010
Officer Jack's Space Police.

818
00:37:42,309 --> 00:37:44,150
This is so detailed.

819
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:44,389
Big...

820
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,179
I cannot be...

821
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,219
Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

822
00:37:58,219 --> 00:37:59,179
I don't want to talk about that.

823
00:37:59,179 --> 00:37:59,659
That's just...

824
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,159
Let's zoom in on that face for a minute here.

825
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:11,860
I love this, though.

826
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,059
This is fucking fantastic.

827
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,460
Look at here.

828
00:38:17,019 --> 00:38:18,460
You've even got that Nightwing.

829
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:21,530
You've just successfully...

830
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:23,369
Besides that part, I mean...

831
00:38:23,929 --> 00:38:26,489
You've just successfully made like a cool Nightwing.

832
00:38:29,269 --> 00:38:31,110
This is just Nightwing but cool.

833
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:33,829
Nightwing is cool, but like this is like a cool Nightwing.

834
00:38:33,829 --> 00:38:40,329
It's incredibly detailed, yeah?

835
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:43,340
This is fantastic.

836
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:48,500
We got...

837
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,539
I make that face a lot.

838
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:54,199
This is like how I feel when I play Animal Crossing.

839
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:55,719
This exact image.

840
00:38:55,719 --> 00:38:59,579
You know what I mean?

841
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:00,780
Anybody else feel like that?

842
00:39:03,699 --> 00:39:04,099
I do.

843
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:06,840
Looks great.

844
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,159
Thank you.

845
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:11,030
Here he's an OK streamer.

846
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,110
This is from, I believe...

847
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:15,030
Was it WarioWare?

848
00:39:15,989 --> 00:39:16,789
There you guys.

849
00:39:18,469 --> 00:39:19,030
That's me.

850
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:24,900
Yoshi's Happy Song, please.

851
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:25,780
Is that what it's called?

852
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:31,000
Rhythm Heaven.

853
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,719
It's not WarioWare.

854
00:39:31,719 --> 00:39:32,760
Oh, well, whatever.

855
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,860
I thought it was...

856
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:36,659
This is not WarioWare?

857
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:38,789
Oh, no, yeah.

858
00:39:38,789 --> 00:39:39,510
It's Rhythm Heaven.

859
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:39,829
You're right.

860
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:49,880
Fucking hate this picture.

861
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:52,039
Why would I...

862
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:53,079
Oh, it's so bad.

863
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,280
It's just...

864
00:39:55,719 --> 00:39:59,030
Like my...

865
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:01,670
Look at my skin is so like blotchy and...

866
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:07,400
Feel like I'm sweating.

867
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,079
My hair is really greasy and stuff.

868
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:10,440
That looks just bad.

869
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:13,239
I hate this fucking picture.

870
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:14,039
You guys don't know that.

871
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:15,239
You mean you do, but you don't.

872
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,079
I really, really don't like this picture.

873
00:40:20,699 --> 00:40:21,260
I hate it.

874
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,300
Look at how many images exist of my face

875
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,340
doing something fucking weird.

876
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:28,219
This is the only one that I truly don't like.

877
00:40:28,219 --> 00:40:29,820
I truly hate this picture.

878
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:31,340
Truly.

879
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,380
Not even making a joke.

880
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,739
Like no fucking around.

881
00:40:33,739 --> 00:40:35,659
I hate this photo.

882
00:40:36,219 --> 00:40:41,639
Every time I see it, I'm just like...

883
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,239
Oh, it's so fucking gross and shitty.

884
00:40:46,519 --> 00:40:48,900
I know this life.

885
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:52,710
This is me trying to beat chili.

886
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:54,630
Fast chilies.

887
00:41:01,179 --> 00:41:03,019
It wasn't fucking completable.

888
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:05,900
It wasn't completable.

889
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,099
This is making me want to click this.

890
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:10,889
Happy Yoshi's song.

891
00:41:10,889 --> 00:41:12,090
Yoshi's happy song.

892
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:17,670
Where is it?

893
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:19,190
I just typed in happy Yoshi.

894
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:21,829
Happy Yoshi's song.

895
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:24,500
Yoshi's happy song.

896
00:41:25,139 --> 00:41:25,619
Is this it?

897
00:41:27,929 --> 00:41:28,489
This is it.

898
00:41:28,489 --> 00:41:28,969
This is it.

899
00:41:28,969 --> 00:41:29,369
You ready?

900
00:41:30,010 --> 00:42:00,579
So I had...

901
00:42:00,579 --> 00:42:00,820
What?

902
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:01,380
Eat what?

903
00:42:10,329 --> 00:42:11,849
Not even fucking close.

904
00:42:11,849 --> 00:42:12,809
You jokers.

905
00:42:13,929 --> 00:42:15,449
You jokesters.

906
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:16,969
Not even fucking close.

907
00:42:16,969 --> 00:42:17,690
Not even close.

908
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:23,130
I was going to give you the benefit of the doubt on that one.

909
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:23,849
Not even close.

910
00:42:24,489 --> 00:42:26,010
Not even remotely close.

911
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:26,809
All right.

912
00:42:26,809 --> 00:42:29,050
How about what about the OST?

913
00:42:29,769 --> 00:42:33,030
It's literally the same.

914
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:33,590
No, it's not.

915
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:34,090
Eat.

916
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,199
No, you're stretching so far.

917
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:45,320
I can hear the first part.

918
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:45,880
But the...

919
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:46,380
Eat.

920
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,800
No, sorry.

921
00:42:52,969 --> 00:42:54,489
No, you're not even close.

922
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:55,769
I'm not going to give that one to you.

923
00:42:55,769 --> 00:43:02,260
This is the six stages of fireman.

924
00:43:06,969 --> 00:43:08,409
The six stages of fireman.

925
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:10,090
It's confusion.

926
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:13,190
Confusion.

927
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:13,989
Confusion.

928
00:43:13,989 --> 00:43:14,630
Insanity.

929
00:43:15,429 --> 00:43:15,829
Lust.

930
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:17,349
Depression.

931
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:21,880
Wistfulness.

932
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,079
And suave.

933
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:25,159
The six stages of fireman.

934
00:43:25,159 --> 00:43:30,489
This is great though.

935
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:35,980
How do you get it to look like this?

936
00:43:36,699 --> 00:43:37,500
That's what I want to know.

937
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:42,869
How do you get the eyes to look like that?

938
00:43:44,309 --> 00:43:48,599
That like the shiny...

939
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:49,880
The shiny eyes would...

940
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,159
They look like they're coming out.

941
00:43:51,159 --> 00:43:51,880
They're bulging.

942
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,079
It's just...

943
00:43:53,079 --> 00:43:53,400
How do you...

944
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,440
What is that technique?

945
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:54,760
It's just...

946
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,039
It's a shading technique.

947
00:43:56,039 --> 00:43:56,840
It looks insane.

948
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,760
It's called talent.

949
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,199
Maybe I should find some.

950
00:44:00,199 --> 00:44:01,320
Is that what you were going to say next?

951
00:44:05,429 --> 00:44:06,630
Even if that person is now...

952
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:08,230
That's not what they were going to say next.

953
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:09,590
I predict that that's what they were going to say.

954
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:10,150
So ban them.

955
00:44:13,739 --> 00:44:15,099
You're a big rat for you.

956
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:17,820
I don't know why I put this one in.

957
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:19,670
I don't know.

958
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:20,389
It's just...

959
00:44:20,389 --> 00:44:20,710
I just...

960
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:22,710
I know...

961
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:22,949
Okay.

962
00:44:22,949 --> 00:44:26,630
I know like I've said that not every submission is guaranteed to get in.

963
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:27,510
And there's...

964
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:29,269
There's a lot of submissions and some fault...

965
00:44:29,829 --> 00:44:31,110
I don't put them all in.

966
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:31,989
And then some people are like,

967
00:44:31,989 --> 00:44:33,750
Why did you fucking put this in then?

968
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:34,550
It's like I don't...

969
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:35,510
I don't know.

970
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:36,389
I don't know.

971
00:44:36,389 --> 00:44:37,269
I don't know.

972
00:44:37,269 --> 00:44:37,829
I just did.

973
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:39,190
I just was like,

974
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:40,150
Oh, I just won.

975
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:40,869
I don't know.

976
00:44:40,869 --> 00:44:41,909
Some of them just get...

977
00:44:41,909 --> 00:44:42,230
I don't know.

978
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:42,869
Some of them going.

979
00:44:43,989 --> 00:44:44,789
I try.

980
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,699
Oh, look.

981
00:44:47,699 --> 00:44:48,820
He ate so much honey.

982
00:44:49,539 --> 00:44:51,099
What is that?

983
00:44:51,099 --> 00:44:51,579
Mustard?

984
00:44:52,139 --> 00:44:53,130
What is that?

985
00:44:57,269 --> 00:44:58,070
It's cheese.

986
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:00,789
Because he's a fucking rat.

987
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:08,260
Thank you, Mr. Spicy Dude.

988
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:11,380
I don't know.

989
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:13,460
The only time you ever see like yellow like that

990
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:15,860
is Winnie the Pooh when he like stuffs his hand inside

991
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:17,059
and puts it all over his face.

992
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:20,869
No, I don't want to control W.

993
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:27,449
He drank Girardi.

994
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:48,099
This one's not much more sane.

995
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:49,219
I'm just...

996
00:45:50,739 --> 00:45:53,449
I don't know.

997
00:45:53,449 --> 00:45:54,329
It's fucked up.

998
00:45:55,610 --> 00:45:58,869
And I don't know why I have the rat in a bottle like that.

999
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:01,739
I...

1000
00:46:01,739 --> 00:46:02,219
It's relevant.

1001
00:46:02,219 --> 00:46:04,219
It was relevant because it was like the crack streams

1002
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:05,579
from the last day or two.

1003
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:08,010
Why is he in the...

1004
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:09,050
Why is he screwed in here?

1005
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:12,980
I'm a quick...

1006
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:13,219
What?

1007
00:46:13,219 --> 00:46:13,699
What?

1008
00:46:13,699 --> 00:46:13,940
What?

1009
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:14,179
What?

1010
00:46:14,179 --> 00:46:14,500
What?

1011
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:14,739
What?

1012
00:46:14,739 --> 00:46:15,059
What?

1013
00:46:15,059 --> 00:46:15,619
What?

1014
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:16,179
What?

1015
00:46:16,179 --> 00:46:16,820
What happened?

1016
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:17,380
What was it?

1017
00:46:18,019 --> 00:46:18,739
What?

1018
00:46:18,739 --> 00:46:19,300
What was it?

1019
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:19,940
What happened?

1020
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:20,500
What was it?

1021
00:46:21,139 --> 00:46:23,449
Is there a dick or something?

1022
00:46:23,449 --> 00:46:31,369
Is there a dick on camera?

1023
00:46:31,369 --> 00:46:31,769
Skip it.

1024
00:46:31,769 --> 00:46:32,250
Skip it.

1025
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:32,650
I don't...

1026
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:33,369
It's just me.

1027
00:46:33,369 --> 00:46:34,329
I don't...

1028
00:46:34,329 --> 00:46:34,650
What?

1029
00:46:36,219 --> 00:46:36,780
Bottom right.

1030
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:37,340
Bottom right.

1031
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,690
There's no dick on the bottom right.

1032
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:40,409
I'm just like...

1033
00:46:40,409 --> 00:46:41,130
I have a rat.

1034
00:46:41,849 --> 00:46:42,329
I don't know like...

1035
00:46:43,829 --> 00:46:45,429
The Fraggles used to do this shit.

1036
00:46:45,429 --> 00:46:47,989
And Fraggle Rock, the guy that used to catch the Fraggles.

1037
00:46:47,989 --> 00:46:48,630
What is this?

1038
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,079
Bottom right.

1039
00:47:01,099 --> 00:47:01,500
Funny.

1040
00:47:03,179 --> 00:47:03,659
I don't get it.

1041
00:47:03,659 --> 00:47:03,900
What?

1042
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,019
I mean what happened?

1043
00:47:05,579 --> 00:47:06,619
Look at how cool this is.

1044
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:11,340
Not bottom right on you.

1045
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:12,780
Bottom right on my screen.

1046
00:47:13,579 --> 00:47:16,010
This is...

1047
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:18,090
Oh, here are the eight stages of Jerma.

1048
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:19,860
Sadness.

1049
00:47:20,739 --> 00:47:21,380
Confusion.

1050
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:23,300
Pretending to know.

1051
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:25,380
Adequate.

1052
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:27,429
Sad.

1053
00:47:28,309 --> 00:47:28,710
Anger.

1054
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:30,309
Acceptance.

1055
00:47:31,179 --> 00:47:32,059
3D.

1056
00:47:32,059 --> 00:47:36,659
There are the eight stages of Jerma 985.

1057
00:47:37,219 --> 00:47:45,820
This is awesome.

1058
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:50,869
I guess this is what it would be like if I was a real cartoon character.

1059
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:53,670
Although real and cartoon characters don't.

1060
00:47:54,309 --> 00:47:55,429
That's an oxymoron.

1061
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:56,550
That doesn't make any sense.

1062
00:47:57,190 --> 00:47:59,980
What are you...

1063
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:01,340
What stage are you in right now?

1064
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:02,380
Find out.

1065
00:48:03,019 --> 00:48:10,710
Fucking anger.

1066
00:48:11,429 --> 00:48:12,469
Always anger.

1067
00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:13,590
Always.

1068
00:48:14,949 --> 00:48:18,969
Hey, this is me from Rhythm Heaven.

1069
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:22,659
There are no more stages.

1070
00:48:22,659 --> 00:48:23,460
Anger only.

1071
00:48:24,179 --> 00:48:28,900
And this is beautiful.

1072
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:33,099
With a little golf...

1073
00:48:33,099 --> 00:48:34,860
With a little golf guy.

1074
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:38,940
Oh, she's burped on you again.

1075
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:42,179
Put on the Outer Wilds OST.

1076
00:48:42,179 --> 00:48:42,679
Ooh.

1077
00:48:44,019 --> 00:48:46,469
That's a good one.

1078
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:47,989
That's a really good one.

1079
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,679
Oh, this is exactly what I was looking for.

1080
00:48:51,239 --> 00:48:56,460
And I won't be listening to it.

1081
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:57,860
I hope it's good.

1082
00:48:58,420 --> 00:48:58,980
Because I can't...

1083
00:48:58,980 --> 00:48:59,780
I have to talk to you.

1084
00:49:00,579 --> 00:49:02,019
Music fucks with my brain.

1085
00:49:02,019 --> 00:49:03,059
I can't have a good message.

1086
00:49:03,059 --> 00:49:04,820
But it goes into my electrodes.

1087
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:05,619
On my head.

1088
00:49:05,619 --> 00:49:06,340
Inside my brain.

1089
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:07,699
I can't talk.

1090
00:49:07,699 --> 00:49:08,739
That's why I don't listen to music.

1091
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:11,820
This is great, though.

1092
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:14,969
Hey, we have a fucking animated rat.

1093
00:49:16,809 --> 00:49:18,090
Animated rat.

1094
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:18,969
Back and forth.

1095
00:49:18,969 --> 00:49:20,409
He's doing this way, that way.

1096
00:49:20,409 --> 00:49:21,130
This way, that way.

1097
00:49:21,849 --> 00:49:25,989
Please get some this way, that ways in the chat, please.

1098
00:49:25,989 --> 00:49:27,829
Hey, any this way, that way in the chat?

1099
00:49:27,989 --> 00:49:29,190
Or sorry, I'm saying it wrong.

1100
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:29,989
This way, that way.

1101
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:34,550
German auto, of course.

1102
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:38,309
Good heavens, would you look at the time.

1103
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:38,869
This is about...

1104
00:49:38,869 --> 00:49:39,909
This is the Lord of the Rings...

1105
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:40,789
The...

1106
00:49:41,429 --> 00:49:41,989
Video game.

1107
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:43,909
The ladder mission.

1108
00:49:44,789 --> 00:49:45,829
I just thought it was funny.

1109
00:49:48,619 --> 00:49:49,579
The more orc sounds.

1110
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:55,030
Oh, no, that's what's on the screen.

1111
00:49:56,409 --> 00:49:56,909
Right.

1112
00:50:03,539 --> 00:50:04,260
It's...

1113
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:04,739
I don't know.

1114
00:50:04,739 --> 00:50:05,380
It just was...

1115
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:06,340
It made me laugh.

1116
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:06,840
And...

1117
00:50:07,559 --> 00:50:10,199
Here's your criteria for how to get on community content night.

1118
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:12,579
Did I open this and go...

1119
00:50:14,599 --> 00:50:15,400
That's it.

1120
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:16,360
Or did I open this and go...

1121
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:19,340
Or did I open this and go...

1122
00:50:21,289 --> 00:50:21,789
Or...

1123
00:50:22,659 --> 00:50:23,380
Huh?

1124
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:25,619
As long as I hit one of the eight stages of fucking...

1125
00:50:25,619 --> 00:50:26,420
Germagreif.

1126
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:26,900
Whatever it is.

1127
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:27,940
Eight stages of Gurb...

1128
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:28,739
Gurb...

1129
00:50:28,739 --> 00:50:29,860
Gurbababy.

1130
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,340
As long as I turn into a Gurbababy on stream, that's how you know.

1131
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:36,969
The eight stages of Gurbababy.

1132
00:50:38,139 --> 00:50:38,780
That is...

1133
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:40,139
I just explained to you what they were.

1134
00:50:40,139 --> 00:50:40,460
I just...

1135
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:41,260
That's all baby.

1136
00:50:42,219 --> 00:50:44,780
Sad, confusion, anger, 3D.

1137
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:45,900
There are...

1138
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:48,460
There are no other baby emotions.

1139
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:58,010
Jex is back for another round.

1140
00:50:58,570 --> 00:51:00,170
And Jex reloaded.

1141
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:05,260
Jeremy Elbertson and Willem Dafoe.

1142
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:09,449
Is Willem Dafoe Jex in this scenario?

1143
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:15,000
And Willem Dafoe is Jex.

1144
00:51:15,559 --> 00:51:19,179
Why are we listening to what?

1145
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:27,159
There.

1146
00:51:27,159 --> 00:51:27,400
Okay.

1147
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:27,960
I changed it.

1148
00:51:29,769 --> 00:51:31,530
Compact streamed pictures presents.

1149
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:33,690
Loud P and Cloud...

1150
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:34,650
Cloud car films.

1151
00:51:35,369 --> 00:51:36,650
Willem Dafoe film.

1152
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:37,849
Jeremy Elbertson.

1153
00:51:37,849 --> 00:51:38,409
Steven...

1154
00:51:38,409 --> 00:51:39,130
Sorry.

1155
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:39,530
Why?

1156
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:40,250
Why is...

1157
00:51:40,329 --> 00:51:41,849
Willem Dafoe Jex reloaded.

1158
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:43,530
Music by John Williams.

1159
00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:47,000
There are more.

1160
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,920
The adventure comes to an end.

1161
00:51:51,559 --> 00:51:53,670
This is Jex, 1985.

1162
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:55,909
Willem Dafoe is in this one too, apparently.

1163
00:51:55,909 --> 00:52:04,090
Jeremy Elbertson, Willem Dafoe, Alicia Winder, Gabe Degrossi.

1164
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:07,989
Well, I love how Xeraxos is just in here too.

1165
00:52:09,269 --> 00:52:11,300
Why is this the end of the stream, boys?

1166
00:52:12,019 --> 00:52:14,440
Jex, 1980.

1167
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:15,079
I think there's another one.

1168
00:52:15,719 --> 00:52:16,440
Yeah.

1169
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,440
From the director that brought you Socrates.

1170
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,800
A Jerva Craft story.

1171
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:23,400
Willem Dafoe and Jeremy Elbertson is Jex.

1172
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,400
A Jermacraft story.

1173
00:52:26,679 --> 00:52:40,219
Okay, like that...

1174
00:52:41,099 --> 00:52:42,139
This is like the...

1175
00:52:42,139 --> 00:52:42,860
If I made the...

1176
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:45,739
You know, like when the YouTuber makes the movie?

1177
00:52:46,219 --> 00:52:49,269
Like, Jex, a Jermacraft story.

1178
00:52:49,269 --> 00:52:50,550
That would probably be what it was.

1179
00:52:50,550 --> 00:52:56,650
I mean, no one would ever give me the money to do that, though.

1180
00:52:56,650 --> 00:53:01,019
No, I don't think so.

1181
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:03,639
I'm not sure...

1182
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:04,280
Here's the thing, guys.

1183
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:09,239
Anytime an investor wants to invest in film production or into a movie,

1184
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,159
they're anticipating some kind of return.

1185
00:53:12,519 --> 00:53:15,159
I could guarantee that whatever movie that...

1186
00:53:15,159 --> 00:53:19,480
If you were an investor in my movie, you would go negative.

1187
00:53:20,039 --> 00:53:21,400
It would not be a single return.

1188
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:24,860
You would just be able to watch the movie and go,

1189
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:27,260
oh, that was kind of...

1190
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:27,820
That was...

1191
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:28,219
All right.

1192
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:30,440
Maybe like...

1193
00:53:31,159 --> 00:53:36,039
I could probably reliably guarantee 1,000 to 2,000 downloads on iTunes.

1194
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:37,559
Like, you know...

1195
00:53:37,559 --> 00:53:39,880
And then I could say, you know, maybe like 10,000 clicks.

1196
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:42,920
And maybe like 1,000 to 2,000 iTunes downloads.

1197
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,170
And that's it.

1198
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:48,900
It would be a flop.

1199
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:49,460
It would be.

1200
00:53:53,639 --> 00:53:54,039
If you don't...

1201
00:53:54,599 --> 00:53:57,239
Do you don't think this movie would be a flop?

1202
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,079
How much money did this cost?

1203
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:01,980
There are 6,500 people right now.

1204
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:06,059
If every single person here watched this movie 50 times,

1205
00:54:06,059 --> 00:54:10,539
that wouldn't even scratch the surface of the last Adam Sandler movie that released on Netflix.

1206
00:54:11,179 --> 00:54:18,869
It would be like one hour of revenue from the latest Adam Sandler movie.

1207
00:54:18,869 --> 00:54:21,380
I don't think it would turn out all right.

1208
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:21,619
I like it.

1209
00:54:21,619 --> 00:54:22,420
This one made me laugh.

1210
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:23,860
Hey, Fred.

1211
00:54:25,059 --> 00:54:27,300
Did you know there are a bunch of cavemen in the car?

1212
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:31,559
Bonnie, shut the fuck up!

1213
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:33,510
Something like that, right?

1214
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:40,409
This is not corny.

1215
00:54:40,409 --> 00:54:41,050
It better not be.

1216
00:54:41,769 --> 00:54:45,300
Why would he?

1217
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:46,260
Why was he Bernie?

1218
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:47,059
What do you mean, Bernie?

1219
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:48,630
Hey, Fred.

1220
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:51,590
Did you know there's a bunch of cavemen in the car?

1221
00:54:51,829 --> 00:54:54,309
That's not everybody's Bernie Sanders, guys.

1222
00:54:55,269 --> 00:54:56,699
Hey, Fred.

1223
00:54:56,699 --> 00:54:57,340
Hey, Fred.

1224
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:58,139
Hey, Fred.

1225
00:54:58,139 --> 00:54:58,699
Hey, Fred.

1226
00:54:58,699 --> 00:55:00,619
Did you know that the banks...

1227
00:55:00,619 --> 00:55:01,340
Okay, it could be.

1228
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:03,099
This needs a little bit more.

1229
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:05,019
It needs a little bit more Bernie pog on it.

1230
00:55:05,019 --> 00:55:05,820
I can see it.

1231
00:55:08,599 --> 00:55:09,559
This is just cute.

1232
00:55:09,559 --> 00:55:15,860
I would probably hurt.

1233
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:19,780
You're literally on fire.

1234
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:20,500
I mean, kind of.

1235
00:55:21,059 --> 00:55:22,309
Not literally.

1236
00:55:22,949 --> 00:55:26,659
I got the hair pretty good, too.

1237
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:34,329
And you've got my big cheekbones and my fucking eye sink.

1238
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:43,639
Ego maniac.

1239
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:48,500
I didn't say anything and that makes me fucking irresistible.

1240
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:49,380
No, I just said that.

1241
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:51,380
You got my face good.

1242
00:55:53,739 --> 00:56:06,409
But I didn't even have to.

1243
00:56:06,409 --> 00:56:23,019
I'm not the Joker.

1244
00:56:23,019 --> 00:56:24,539
I'm the Riddler.

1245
00:56:24,539 --> 00:56:27,110
And I know, we've gone over this before.

1246
00:56:27,110 --> 00:56:30,070
Everyone that says they're the Riddler is the Joker.

1247
00:56:30,070 --> 00:56:33,030
And everyone that says they're the Joker is Robin.

1248
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:33,510
I know.

1249
00:56:34,070 --> 00:56:34,869
I get it.

1250
00:56:34,869 --> 00:56:36,309
Trust me, we've talked about it.

1251
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:54,679
But I wasn't crying on that one.

1252
00:57:01,099 --> 00:57:02,139
I wasn't crying.

1253
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:05,500
I was not crying.

1254
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:10,699
I was just, I was just stage, I was stage five.

1255
00:57:10,699 --> 00:57:11,500
Confused.

1256
00:57:12,059 --> 00:57:28,070
Change the world.

1257
00:57:29,829 --> 00:57:30,230
I don't know.

1258
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:30,710
What is this?

1259
00:57:31,429 --> 00:57:31,909
Goodbye.

1260
00:57:32,469 --> 00:57:37,639
My message.

1261
00:57:38,199 --> 00:57:39,400
Change, change, change.

1262
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:39,719
What?

1263
00:57:39,719 --> 00:57:40,119
What?

1264
00:57:40,119 --> 00:57:40,360
What?

1265
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:41,400
Do I need to?

1266
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:41,639
Okay.

1267
00:57:42,679 --> 00:57:43,719
Do I need some screening?

1268
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:46,789
Do I need screening on these?

1269
00:57:46,789 --> 00:57:48,789
Have I gotten to the point where I need these to be screened?

1270
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:52,840
Yes.

1271
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:53,639
Fuck.

1272
00:57:53,639 --> 00:58:00,199
This is from the take a picture of your face with your iPhone

1273
00:58:00,199 --> 00:58:01,159
and everyone looks like that.

1274
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:02,760
What's this though?

1275
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:05,320
What's the whole dug here?

1276
00:58:06,119 --> 00:58:15,619
Is that a Game Boy?

1277
00:58:16,579 --> 00:58:18,500
Oh, that's Hidden Folk.

1278
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:19,380
Oh, right, right, right.

1279
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:27,320
This one's just, this one's the kiss.

1280
00:58:28,039 --> 00:58:33,019
The kiss.

1281
00:58:33,019 --> 00:58:34,699
Is there any music playing?

1282
00:58:34,699 --> 00:58:38,059
Why does it look like there's no music?

1283
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:42,039
That's very clever.

1284
00:58:47,769 --> 00:58:50,969
Well, let's get some, let's get something upbeat.

1285
00:58:51,610 --> 00:58:54,010
Something upbeat but still relatively smooth and calm.

1286
00:58:55,050 --> 00:59:00,309
What's another one that's like a smooth and calm but upbeat at the same time?

1287
00:59:01,429 --> 00:59:02,840
Mario Galaxy.

1288
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:03,960
Yeah, oh yeah, let's go.

1289
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:05,239
Mario Galaxy OST.

1290
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:16,380
Oh yeah, perfect.

1291
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:22,840
This is empty and it's annoying me.

1292
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:23,880
This is annoying to me.

1293
00:59:25,429 --> 00:59:28,710
No, what I saw, you know what I would love to install in this room?

1294
00:59:29,349 --> 00:59:34,630
It's like a fucking spigot that is connected to like high C fruit juice shit.

1295
00:59:35,429 --> 00:59:37,269
Like it's connected to the ceiling and there's a pipe

1296
00:59:37,269 --> 00:59:40,150
that goes all the way like around into the fridge

1297
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:45,909
and it's just the high C like red juice is just filled in a big bucket

1298
00:59:45,909 --> 00:59:48,389
and there's a little spigot that comes down right here.

1299
00:59:48,389 --> 00:59:49,829
Like literally right there.

1300
00:59:49,829 --> 00:59:54,460
And I can just go over here and just go and fill it up with high C fruit punch.

1301
00:59:55,460 --> 01:00:01,260
Oh, that's a hamster.

1302
01:00:02,619 --> 01:00:06,780
Okay, and have you noticed how just, how well that works?

1303
01:00:08,090 --> 01:00:10,489
If I had, don't even give me this bullshit.

1304
01:00:10,489 --> 01:00:14,889
If you guys had a hamster feeder in your room, you don't, you wouldn't use it.

1305
01:00:14,889 --> 01:00:16,329
It wouldn't be something that you did every day.

1306
01:00:17,539 --> 01:00:22,420
If you were able to, there was a big thing right there that just always,

1307
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:26,420
always gave you never ending liquid and food.

1308
01:00:27,139 --> 01:00:28,500
I would be okay with this.

1309
01:00:29,579 --> 01:00:33,659
If it turned out that I was just, I was just in like, I was a hamster

1310
01:00:33,659 --> 01:00:37,099
and there was somebody just feeding me fucking just huge water.

1311
01:00:37,099 --> 01:00:38,780
I would be like, oh shit, this is free.

1312
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:39,500
This is awesome.

1313
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:43,480
The Reddit, you're a Reddit hamster man child.

1314
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:46,659
Okay.

1315
01:00:46,659 --> 01:00:51,460
If there was a never ending supply of water and food right there, huge.

1316
01:00:52,409 --> 01:00:58,460
And all I had to do was go like, wow, it's fucking never ending.

1317
01:00:59,179 --> 01:01:03,739
And so, and every like, every like few days, a huge hand comes in

1318
01:01:03,739 --> 01:01:06,219
and just like unscrews the fucking thing.

1319
01:01:06,219 --> 01:01:10,059
And then I see another huge hand, put it back and it's just, I didn't have to do shit.

1320
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:13,099
I didn't have to do anything.

1321
01:01:13,099 --> 01:01:14,860
You just, you gave that to me.

1322
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:17,900
Oh, let's get another free refill, man.

1323
01:01:20,969 --> 01:01:21,610
You're lazy.

1324
01:01:22,329 --> 01:01:24,579
This is weird, weird, weird.

1325
01:01:24,579 --> 01:01:25,539
What do you mean weird?

1326
01:01:25,539 --> 01:01:26,420
How is this weird?

1327
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:27,860
This is a, what?

1328
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:34,699
This is due to, why are you doing this?

1329
01:01:34,699 --> 01:01:38,789
This is a, this is a, this is a creepy fetish.

1330
01:01:39,349 --> 01:01:39,590
What?

1331
01:01:40,579 --> 01:01:46,019
No, I just wanted, I just thought it would be cool to have a bunch of stuff for free.

1332
01:01:46,579 --> 01:01:48,340
Like a never ending water.

1333
01:01:49,139 --> 01:01:52,219
I just want to be like the hamster.

1334
01:01:52,219 --> 01:01:53,099
Is that, what?

1335
01:01:55,940 --> 01:01:58,579
I just wanted to have a big giant.

1336
01:01:58,579 --> 01:01:58,980
All right.

1337
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:03,320
You know how you can get like the water jugs with the water cooler thing?

1338
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:03,960
A water cooler.

1339
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:05,079
You can get one of those.

1340
01:02:05,079 --> 01:02:08,360
Imagine if the water cooler was a hundred times the size

1341
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:09,960
and it was connected to your garage.

1342
01:02:10,519 --> 01:02:12,409
What's so wrong with that?

1343
01:02:14,179 --> 01:02:15,219
What's wrong with that?

1344
01:02:15,219 --> 01:02:21,079
Would you rather have a place to put your car in your garage

1345
01:02:21,079 --> 01:02:24,440
or a big water jug that was like 6,000 gallons?

1346
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:28,360
I don't understand what the problem is.

1347
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:29,000
This is cool though.

1348
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,039
Nice image.

1349
01:02:30,039 --> 01:02:34,840
This is great.

1350
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:36,280
I love this one too.

1351
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:38,119
Auto in the baby carrier.

1352
01:02:38,119 --> 01:02:41,000
I mean, tap water.

1353
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:49,099
No, no, like purified, clean, super quadruple osmosis

1354
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:52,409
and then cleaned and then put through another filter.

1355
01:02:52,409 --> 01:02:55,139
Triple water, not tap water.

1356
01:02:55,139 --> 01:02:56,570
No.

1357
01:02:56,570 --> 01:02:58,329
You guys always make fun of boomers.

1358
01:02:58,329 --> 01:03:00,150
Boomers drink tap water.

1359
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:01,190
That's like a boomer thing.

1360
01:03:02,230 --> 01:03:04,630
I'll take that tap water from the sinks.

1361
01:03:04,630 --> 01:03:06,679
That's a boomer thing.

1362
01:03:06,679 --> 01:03:14,469
You guys have more in common than you think?

1363
01:03:14,469 --> 01:03:15,780
Yes, it is.

1364
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:17,429
You know how I know that?

1365
01:03:17,429 --> 01:03:21,510
Because my grandmother used to have friends over to play bridge.

1366
01:03:22,789 --> 01:03:25,030
And that's where this voice comes from, by the way.

1367
01:03:25,030 --> 01:03:28,309
This is just me doing an imitation of my grandmother.

1368
01:03:28,309 --> 01:03:30,869
This is exactly how my grandmother used to talk.

1369
01:03:31,670 --> 01:03:34,090
This is her exact voice.

1370
01:03:34,090 --> 01:03:37,980
So they would come over and all of them would drink tap water.

1371
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:40,260
They'd be like, oh, do you want something to drink?

1372
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:41,940
Yeah, I'll drink tap water.

1373
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:43,699
It's fine.

1374
01:03:43,699 --> 01:03:44,420
They would all line up.

1375
01:03:48,219 --> 01:03:49,559
We had sodas.

1376
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:50,920
We had bottles.

1377
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:51,960
We had all kinds of...

1378
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:52,760
We had like juice.

1379
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:54,199
We had orange juice.

1380
01:03:54,199 --> 01:03:55,800
We had fucking...

1381
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,239
They were like beers.

1382
01:03:57,239 --> 01:03:59,480
No, just tap water is fine.

1383
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:05,369
It's cute.

1384
01:04:05,369 --> 01:04:08,059
They are zoomers, Jerma.

1385
01:04:08,059 --> 01:04:09,420
Water equals boomer.

1386
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:09,920
No.

1387
01:04:10,539 --> 01:04:13,900
I'm telling you, drinking tap water out of like the kitchen sink.

1388
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:14,380
That's a...

1389
01:04:14,380 --> 01:04:15,659
Boomers love that.

1390
01:04:15,659 --> 01:04:18,789
You're a furry.

1391
01:04:18,789 --> 01:04:19,909
How does this make me a furry?

1392
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:30,900
Drinking tap water makes me a furry.

1393
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:37,110
This is fantastic, though.

1394
01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:37,750
I love this.

1395
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:39,269
And I love coffee, too.

1396
01:04:39,269 --> 01:04:42,199
I should just get one of these mugs.

1397
01:04:42,199 --> 01:04:48,099
You were purring.

1398
01:04:48,099 --> 01:04:56,460
Motherfuckers.

1399
01:04:57,579 --> 01:04:59,420
You motherfuckers.

1400
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:02,619
Because I was doing the water sound.

1401
01:05:02,619 --> 01:05:03,119
Whatever.

1402
01:05:03,739 --> 01:05:11,980
I was going to use that and put it somewhere that I...

1403
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:13,260
This is how I feel every day.

1404
01:05:14,059 --> 01:05:20,329
Everybody else get up in the morning, look in the mirror, and this is what you see.

1405
01:05:22,230 --> 01:05:23,909
That's just how I feel when I get...

1406
01:05:23,909 --> 01:05:26,389
When I'm looking in the mirror in the morning, this is just what I feel.

1407
01:05:28,420 --> 01:05:31,820
It's like, but look at...

1408
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:33,019
You've got the...

1409
01:05:33,019 --> 01:05:33,519
The...

1410
01:05:41,539 --> 01:05:42,099
Butthead.

1411
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:44,260
From Beavis and Butthead.

1412
01:05:49,210 --> 01:05:54,409
Yes, I'm coming to the realization now that I am the combination of both Beavis and Butthead.

1413
01:05:56,889 --> 01:05:57,610
I know.

1414
01:05:57,610 --> 01:06:04,380
Laugh at everything.

1415
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:11,030
I think the dumbest shit is cool.

1416
01:06:12,219 --> 01:06:13,099
I look like that.

1417
01:06:14,059 --> 01:06:14,940
I know.

1418
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:16,619
I'm both Beavis and Butthead.

1419
01:06:16,619 --> 01:06:19,019
But I have linguistic skills.

1420
01:06:24,570 --> 01:06:26,650
I have high linguistic skills.

1421
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:28,809
My talking and my pronunciation.

1422
01:06:29,369 --> 01:06:36,679
I'm only like 40% Beavis and Butthead.

1423
01:06:36,679 --> 01:06:38,199
I don't know half the things I'm saying.

1424
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:41,510
But phonetically, I can say whatever you want.

1425
01:06:44,599 --> 01:06:48,010
Uh...

1426
01:06:48,010 --> 01:06:48,489
Excellent.

1427
01:06:48,489 --> 01:06:49,610
Excellent articulation.

1428
01:06:49,610 --> 01:06:50,110
Yeah.

1429
01:06:51,909 --> 01:06:52,550
Excellent.

1430
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:53,829
Excellent articulation.

1431
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:00,940
I love this.

1432
01:07:02,090 --> 01:07:03,050
Skip this one.

1433
01:07:03,050 --> 01:07:04,409
No, that's not...

1434
01:07:04,409 --> 01:07:05,210
That's a pencil.

1435
01:07:06,889 --> 01:07:08,010
He's got...

1436
01:07:08,010 --> 01:07:09,369
It's an eraser.

1437
01:07:10,010 --> 01:07:13,110
It's an eraser.

1438
01:07:13,849 --> 01:07:14,650
It's an eraser.

1439
01:07:15,210 --> 01:07:16,010
It's an eraser.

1440
01:07:17,739 --> 01:07:18,940
It's just an eraser.

1441
01:07:19,579 --> 01:07:22,940
This is great, though.

1442
01:07:22,940 --> 01:07:23,440
Thank you.

1443
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:27,179
Shido's back there.

1444
01:07:27,179 --> 01:07:28,219
You've seen Shido.

1445
01:07:28,219 --> 01:07:28,940
Everyone always...

1446
01:07:28,940 --> 01:07:30,460
No, it's not underwear.

1447
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:31,179
It's an eraser.

1448
01:07:35,159 --> 01:07:37,400
Why is Super Mario Galaxy playing?

1449
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:37,960
It's...

1450
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:38,440
I don't know.

1451
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:39,480
Because people wanted to...

1452
01:07:40,119 --> 01:07:44,019
Well, this doesn't really match up at all.

1453
01:07:44,579 --> 01:07:50,860
That's better.

1454
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:56,619
There's the winks.

1455
01:07:58,409 --> 01:07:58,889
Should I do it?

1456
01:07:58,889 --> 01:08:00,250
Should I redeem one?

1457
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:05,179
Look at this.

1458
01:08:05,179 --> 01:08:09,579
And these have become so bad.

1459
01:08:11,099 --> 01:08:12,119
It's like...

1460
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:15,159
There's too much here.

1461
01:08:16,119 --> 01:08:17,479
And too much here.

1462
01:08:18,279 --> 01:08:19,319
It's the same shirt.

1463
01:08:22,659 --> 01:08:23,859
It's like a blue shirt.

1464
01:08:23,859 --> 01:08:24,260
Whatever.

1465
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:26,020
Yeah, I can't have more than one or two blue shirts.

1466
01:08:30,060 --> 01:08:33,640
And then you got like this shit here.

1467
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:37,720
Okay, you want to see how to make yourself look really old real quickly?

1468
01:08:38,279 --> 01:08:38,840
I'll show you.

1469
01:08:39,479 --> 01:08:39,800
Okay.

1470
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:44,869
Guess.

1471
01:08:44,869 --> 01:08:45,430
Guess my age.

1472
01:08:46,229 --> 01:08:49,829
32?

1473
01:08:49,829 --> 01:08:50,390
30?

1474
01:08:50,390 --> 01:08:51,350
28?

1475
01:08:51,350 --> 01:08:51,670
Okay.

1476
01:08:52,310 --> 01:08:54,569
Now guess my age.

1477
01:09:14,229 --> 01:09:15,029
40.

1478
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:19,579
Ready?

1479
01:09:19,579 --> 01:09:27,579
28.

1480
01:09:27,579 --> 01:09:28,220
40.

1481
01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:33,979
28.

1482
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:39,859
These hairs on these sideburn hairs?

1483
01:09:40,579 --> 01:09:43,260
When they stick out, you just look fucking 100 years old.

1484
01:09:47,130 --> 01:09:47,770
You're losing it.

1485
01:09:47,770 --> 01:09:48,170
No, I'm not.

1486
01:09:48,170 --> 01:09:48,649
That's real.

1487
01:09:49,210 --> 01:09:51,189
It was literally the same.

1488
01:09:51,189 --> 01:09:51,829
No, it wasn't.

1489
01:09:51,829 --> 01:09:53,670
It was these like sideburn hairs.

1490
01:09:53,670 --> 01:09:53,989
Look at...

1491
01:09:53,989 --> 01:09:54,550
This is like...

1492
01:09:54,550 --> 01:09:55,189
This is...

1493
01:09:55,189 --> 01:09:55,750
Look at that.

1494
01:09:56,310 --> 01:09:58,789
That increases my age by 10 years by doing this.

1495
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:02,220
Look.

1496
01:10:02,220 --> 01:10:08,439
I just reduced my age by 10 years.

1497
01:10:10,619 --> 01:10:11,819
You're so self-conscious.

1498
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:15,750
No, I'm self-awareness.

1499
01:10:19,270 --> 01:10:19,909
Tell me.

1500
01:10:19,909 --> 01:10:23,189
Just close these down and you'll look like fucking 20 again.

1501
01:10:23,909 --> 01:10:29,449
You are too self-conscious.

1502
01:10:29,449 --> 01:10:30,170
No, I'm not.

1503
01:10:30,170 --> 01:10:30,329
I...

1504
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:35,880
I just showed my sideburn hair to 6,500 people.

1505
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:36,920
That's not self-conscious.

1506
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:37,399
That's...

1507
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:37,880
Look at me.

1508
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:40,859
I believe that's Joel.

1509
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:42,939
I'm not...

1510
01:10:42,939 --> 01:10:43,979
Self-conscious be like,

1511
01:10:43,979 --> 01:10:45,100
Holy shit, I don't like this.

1512
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:46,699
Therefore, you'll never see me again.

1513
01:10:46,699 --> 01:10:47,340
No, we're on.

1514
01:10:48,380 --> 01:10:56,939
I remember this.

1515
01:10:56,939 --> 01:10:57,659
This was...

1516
01:10:57,659 --> 01:10:58,300
This was bad.

1517
01:11:00,710 --> 01:11:02,470
God of War, you motherfucker.

1518
01:11:05,850 --> 01:11:06,329
Yeah.

1519
01:11:06,409 --> 01:11:11,770
Remember, you have a weird anxiety about social perception.

1520
01:11:11,770 --> 01:11:13,739
I don't think so.

1521
01:11:16,619 --> 01:11:17,020
Hold on.

1522
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:20,329
Let me just...

1523
01:11:21,289 --> 01:11:22,970
Let's test that hypothesis.

1524
01:11:22,970 --> 01:11:44,229
What was...

1525
01:11:44,229 --> 01:11:46,069
Anything interesting written in the chat?

1526
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:51,819
I think I saw...

1527
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:53,979
No, no, nothing.

1528
01:11:54,539 --> 01:11:55,739
I don't think so.

1529
01:11:58,119 --> 01:11:59,880
I didn't see anything about potential...

1530
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,600
Of huge zits that I could have on my forehead.

1531
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:05,079
No, but why would I really write that?

1532
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:07,720
What an odd social perception that I have.

1533
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:12,140
I don't want to...

1534
01:12:12,140 --> 01:12:12,939
I don't want to hear music.

1535
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:16,899
He's ugly.

1536
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:22,220
It's a collection of zits.

1537
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:23,020
No, it's two.

1538
01:12:23,899 --> 01:12:27,180
I don't care.

1539
01:12:27,180 --> 01:12:27,979
Ugly.

1540
01:12:27,979 --> 01:12:29,739
I think I'm beautiful.

1541
01:12:30,460 --> 01:12:31,739
That's all that matters.

1542
01:12:41,220 --> 01:12:43,140
Here's some go-go squeezy.

1543
01:12:44,039 --> 01:12:45,159
Because you're epic.

1544
01:12:48,779 --> 01:12:50,939
Is this me just doing a JoJo dance?

1545
01:13:01,529 --> 01:13:04,090
But yes, these are good.

1546
01:13:05,210 --> 01:13:06,729
Why do people have such a problem with that?

1547
01:13:06,729 --> 01:13:07,609
These are fantastic.

1548
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:15,699
I actually haven't eaten one of these in a long time.

1549
01:13:15,699 --> 01:13:17,060
I do highly recommend them.

1550
01:13:18,010 --> 01:13:18,729
It's baby food.

1551
01:13:18,729 --> 01:13:19,449
It's a streamer food.

1552
01:13:19,449 --> 01:13:21,449
And people like to call me crazy for it, but that's fine.

1553
01:13:22,090 --> 01:13:23,689
This was prefaced by saying,

1554
01:13:23,689 --> 01:13:25,770
Jerma, please play The Sims 1.

1555
01:13:26,810 --> 01:13:36,600
Maybe one day.

1556
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:42,840
I'll be taking that one.

1557
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:44,520
Look at this shit.

1558
01:13:48,409 --> 01:13:49,369
Oh, I love this.

1559
01:13:58,229 --> 01:13:59,109
It's so good.

1560
01:13:59,109 --> 01:14:00,229
It's so detailed.

1561
01:14:00,229 --> 01:14:01,430
This is a great poster.

1562
01:14:02,229 --> 01:14:05,369
Take a look.

1563
01:14:05,369 --> 01:14:06,890
Make sure you show who did it.

1564
01:14:06,890 --> 01:14:08,630
He's an actual demon.

1565
01:14:11,619 --> 01:14:13,380
I want to get like a bunch of big coins.

1566
01:14:14,579 --> 01:14:18,260
Where can I get like a big heavy like minted good

1567
01:14:18,260 --> 01:14:19,939
just real like coin?

1568
01:14:22,439 --> 01:14:23,560
Like a silver coin.

1569
01:14:24,119 --> 01:14:26,140
I feel like just holding them and moving around.

1570
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:27,180
Just forge one yourself.

1571
01:14:27,819 --> 01:14:28,460
Go to the bank.

1572
01:14:30,579 --> 01:14:32,020
So if I walk into the bank and I say,

1573
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:34,420
what's the biggest coin you guys have here?

1574
01:14:34,979 --> 01:14:35,939
What are they going to say?

1575
01:14:41,319 --> 01:14:42,119
Was it a half dollar?

1576
01:14:44,329 --> 01:14:46,949
Go to Etsy.

1577
01:14:46,949 --> 01:14:50,949
Yeah, but I want it to be as an Etsy coin fake.

1578
01:14:50,949 --> 01:14:52,310
It's not like a real tender.

1579
01:14:53,430 --> 01:14:54,789
You know what I'm annoyed with?

1580
01:14:55,430 --> 01:14:58,310
Why on earth over the years did I not listen?

1581
01:14:59,029 --> 01:15:04,229
To those commercials that were on always at two to four o'clock in the morning.

1582
01:15:05,430 --> 01:15:09,510
And this never before minted gold rhino.

1583
01:15:10,550 --> 01:15:12,550
Only $19.99.

1584
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:13,909
Two for the price of one.

1585
01:15:13,909 --> 01:15:15,109
Why did I not get a bunch of those?

1586
01:15:17,859 --> 01:15:25,300
This 1917 golden rhino was only available for three days until now.

1587
01:15:25,939 --> 01:15:30,180
We allowed four collectors into the vault to find this one piece.

1588
01:15:30,739 --> 01:15:33,859
And it could be yours for a limited time only.

1589
01:15:33,859 --> 01:15:40,979
The first 1,000 callers will get access to the golden 1916 rhino.

1590
01:15:40,979 --> 01:15:45,560
By the way, even if 10,000 people call, you'll all get one.

1591
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:49,640
This is a way to make old people think they have to hurry the fuck to the telephone

1592
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:51,640
to call as soon as possible.

1593
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:55,079
But by the way, the 800 number will stay the same

1594
01:15:55,079 --> 01:15:59,210
over the course of 16 weeks that this commercial airs.

1595
01:15:59,210 --> 01:16:05,130
Hurry, get to a phone line now and reserve your 1917 golden rhino.

1596
01:16:05,130 --> 01:16:08,779
I wish I did.

1597
01:16:08,779 --> 01:16:09,579
Why didn't I do that?

1598
01:16:14,420 --> 01:16:17,159
I want those now.

1599
01:16:17,159 --> 01:16:17,960
And they were huge.

1600
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:19,079
They were like this big.

1601
01:16:20,199 --> 01:16:24,199
There was a 1917 golden rhino that was this fucking big.

1602
01:16:27,449 --> 01:16:28,729
You'd break your thumb and it would hurt.

1603
01:16:28,729 --> 01:16:29,529
And you have to be careful.

1604
01:16:29,529 --> 01:16:33,369
Like you could break a cheekbone with that thing.

1605
01:16:33,369 --> 01:16:34,329
I want one.

1606
01:16:34,329 --> 01:16:54,409
Penis music.

1607
01:16:54,409 --> 01:16:56,729
Anyways, I want like a big heavy coin.

1608
01:16:57,449 --> 01:16:58,810
I know like, what do you think you are?

1609
01:16:58,810 --> 01:16:59,289
Two fish?

1610
01:16:59,289 --> 01:17:01,930
Like, no, I just think I want them.

1611
01:17:02,569 --> 01:17:03,770
I don't care what they are.

1612
01:17:03,770 --> 01:17:05,050
I'll just I want one.

1613
01:17:05,050 --> 01:17:21,369
All right, somebody made a custom mod for Diablo 2,

1614
01:17:21,369 --> 01:17:22,890
by the way, favorite game of all time.

1615
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:25,979
The giant enemy spider.

1616
01:17:27,699 --> 01:17:29,859
Demon cursed extra strong spectral hit.

1617
01:17:29,859 --> 01:17:30,579
You got to watch out.

1618
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:34,600
It's a modded Diablo.

1619
01:17:35,159 --> 01:17:41,100
They also have the giant rat who makes all the rules.

1620
01:17:42,279 --> 01:17:43,079
That's so fun.

1621
01:17:45,699 --> 01:17:48,020
Demon spectral hit cursed extra strong.

1622
01:17:48,659 --> 01:17:54,170
It's a long tagline, too, for a monster name.

1623
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:55,050
It's funny.

1624
01:17:55,050 --> 01:18:02,489
All the cat police.

1625
01:18:02,489 --> 01:18:03,689
Say the line, Bart.

1626
01:18:04,489 --> 01:18:06,409
I'm the giant rat that makes all the rules.

1627
01:18:07,130 --> 01:18:09,609
See what kind of trouble we can get ourselves into.

1628
01:18:09,609 --> 01:18:10,170
I said it.

1629
01:18:11,050 --> 01:18:12,760
I say I said it.

1630
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:14,119
I said it.

1631
01:18:20,569 --> 01:18:22,569
I'm the giant rat that makes all the rules.

1632
01:18:33,619 --> 01:18:36,420
And this is, of course, how could I forget

1633
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:39,140
that this is a Jew wizard reset.

1634
01:18:40,630 --> 01:18:45,270
Red dress with a Diablo 2 paladin scepter.

1635
01:18:45,270 --> 01:18:46,569
That's fucking funny.

1636
01:18:46,569 --> 01:18:47,050
I love it.

1637
01:18:49,399 --> 01:18:50,439
Bathrobe wizard.

1638
01:18:50,439 --> 01:18:59,159
Yeah, I love how it's the set is red dress bathrobe

1639
01:18:59,159 --> 01:19:03,079
and then a Diablo 2 paladin scepter.

1640
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:05,960
But we're in the game Diablo 2.

1641
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:09,640
Why does it have to be the Diablo 2 paladin scepter?

1642
01:19:10,979 --> 01:19:11,939
Oh, I love it.

1643
01:19:11,939 --> 01:19:13,539
I love humor.

1644
01:19:13,539 --> 01:19:15,060
Everybody else just love humor.

1645
01:19:16,420 --> 01:19:20,760
It keeps me rolling.

1646
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:21,880
Monkey sees action.

1647
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:27,159
Streamer sees action.

1648
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:28,890
Forgive me.

1649
01:19:28,890 --> 01:19:30,409
Omega Lulz in chat, I guess.

1650
01:19:38,380 --> 01:19:39,180
Forgive me.

1651
01:19:39,180 --> 01:19:42,140
And then Omega Lulz in chat.

1652
01:19:45,109 --> 01:19:45,670
Thank you.

1653
01:19:45,670 --> 01:19:47,189
Thank you, boogers95.

1654
01:19:49,460 --> 01:19:52,340
$50 just came in from phylactery lich.

1655
01:19:53,609 --> 01:19:54,409
5,000 bits.

1656
01:19:54,409 --> 01:19:55,850
Ha ha, streamer say funny thing.

1657
01:19:55,850 --> 01:19:57,930
Make brain go brrr.

1658
01:19:58,890 --> 01:20:02,539
Omega Lulz, Omega Lulz, Omega Lulz.

1659
01:20:02,539 --> 01:20:04,539
Yeah, Omega Lulz in chat, guys.

1660
01:20:04,539 --> 01:20:05,100
Yeah, they are.

1661
01:20:08,140 --> 01:20:08,939
Darkest dungeon.

1662
01:20:09,739 --> 01:20:14,090
This game was really fun until I got frustrated and couldn't do it.

1663
01:20:14,090 --> 01:20:19,380
But thanks for the $50, phylactery.

1664
01:20:25,899 --> 01:20:27,819
Game is fun until it isn't.

1665
01:20:27,819 --> 01:20:28,699
I mean every game.

1666
01:20:33,590 --> 01:20:34,869
I was about to turn on the effects.

1667
01:20:35,750 --> 01:20:37,000
You weren't going to like it.

1668
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:40,739
Oh, yeah.

1669
01:20:40,739 --> 01:20:40,819
Okay.

1670
01:20:40,819 --> 01:20:42,020
What about point blank free?

1671
01:20:43,770 --> 01:20:44,170
Oh, yeah.

1672
01:20:44,170 --> 01:20:47,130
What about point blank when I did the bonus round in the first try?

1673
01:20:47,130 --> 01:20:48,489
With the light gun.

1674
01:20:48,970 --> 01:20:50,090
We don't forget about those.

1675
01:20:50,090 --> 01:20:52,890
What about when I beat champion Gundyr first try?

1676
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:53,689
We forget about those.

1677
01:20:53,689 --> 01:20:55,130
Remember when I beat Dancer first try?

1678
01:20:55,130 --> 01:20:56,250
We don't remember that.

1679
01:20:57,449 --> 01:20:58,649
I'm going to beat the last boss.

1680
01:20:58,649 --> 01:21:01,930
The final actual boss in Sekiro in like a couple hours.

1681
01:21:01,930 --> 01:21:02,890
We forget about that, though.

1682
01:21:02,890 --> 01:21:04,170
We don't talk about that here.

1683
01:21:04,170 --> 01:21:04,890
No.

1684
01:21:04,890 --> 01:21:05,770
No, no, idiot.

1685
01:21:05,770 --> 01:21:07,050
Idiot go brrr, right?

1686
01:21:09,529 --> 01:21:10,170
Unbelievable.

1687
01:21:17,770 --> 01:21:20,569
Ratatouille 6 piece was never an option.

1688
01:21:21,369 --> 01:21:43,369
No, I can't go back.

1689
01:21:43,930 --> 01:21:44,569
Change music?

1690
01:21:44,569 --> 01:21:47,659
All right, I'll skip ahead.

1691
01:21:47,659 --> 01:21:48,300
This is scary.

1692
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:51,050
There's another greedy grinner.

1693
01:21:52,699 --> 01:21:54,380
See, look at that big ass coin.

1694
01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:58,619
We could make decisions with that coin.

1695
01:21:58,619 --> 01:22:02,220
Imagine if we made stream decisions with like a big gold coin.

1696
01:22:07,829 --> 01:22:08,470
I want one.

1697
01:22:08,470 --> 01:22:09,109
I'm going to get one.

1698
01:22:10,180 --> 01:22:11,380
I'm going to get one.

1699
01:22:11,380 --> 01:22:14,890
It's a quarter.

1700
01:22:14,890 --> 01:22:15,930
No, it can't be a quarter.

1701
01:22:15,930 --> 01:22:19,689
It's going to be like a big, at least like half a pound coin.

1702
01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:22,890
That's going to have to wait.

1703
01:22:22,890 --> 01:22:24,409
It's going to be like a quarter inch thick.

1704
01:22:25,590 --> 01:22:27,750
How much is like a quarter inch thick?

1705
01:22:28,310 --> 01:22:29,909
Like a half a pound gold coin?

1706
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:31,979
Find out.

1707
01:22:31,979 --> 01:22:33,340
How much is a pound of gold worth?

1708
01:22:34,220 --> 01:22:36,140
One pound of gold is what?

1709
01:22:38,010 --> 01:22:39,289
One pound of gold price.

1710
01:22:42,229 --> 01:22:47,750
One pound of gold today would sell for about $15,000, $18,000.

1711
01:22:58,409 --> 01:22:58,970
Well, okay.

1712
01:22:59,609 --> 01:23:00,890
So can I get a comedy one?

1713
01:23:02,939 --> 01:23:03,979
You can afford that.

1714
01:23:05,750 --> 01:23:08,310
I can't think of things that I'm trying to think of.

1715
01:23:08,310 --> 01:23:15,029
That's a weird flex to like just have this giant fucking like $20,000 coin.

1716
01:23:15,829 --> 01:23:17,590
That would be, that would be pretty fucked up.

1717
01:23:17,590 --> 01:23:19,270
Let me, let me like address you directly here.

1718
01:23:19,270 --> 01:23:20,310
That would be pretty fucked up.

1719
01:23:21,350 --> 01:23:22,630
If I was just the guy.

1720
01:23:22,630 --> 01:23:23,270
Oh, streamer.

1721
01:23:23,270 --> 01:23:24,229
This is what he does.

1722
01:23:24,229 --> 01:23:29,350
He has a $20,000, one inch thick gold coin that he just shows off every day.

1723
01:23:30,229 --> 01:23:33,399
I don't think I want one of those.

1724
01:23:36,010 --> 01:23:43,899
And he flips this, this, this 20 K gold coin to like make stream decisions.

1725
01:23:48,569 --> 01:23:49,850
It's big Reddit gold.

1726
01:23:50,569 --> 01:23:52,390
All right.

1727
01:23:52,390 --> 01:23:54,329
How much is like a, all right.

1728
01:23:54,329 --> 01:23:55,529
What about silver?

1729
01:23:55,609 --> 01:23:56,149
Oh no.

1730
01:23:56,149 --> 01:23:57,029
What about platinum?

1731
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:00,920
How much is like a, like a, like a, how much is a platinum coin?

1732
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:02,199
Like a big platinum coin.

1733
01:24:03,319 --> 01:24:04,199
Platinum is okay.

1734
01:24:04,199 --> 01:24:06,520
One pound platinum coin.

1735
01:24:07,319 --> 01:24:07,960
Do they exist?

1736
01:24:12,069 --> 01:24:12,390
Okay.

1737
01:24:12,390 --> 01:24:16,869
There's a thousand dollars for a gigantic platinum coin.

1738
01:24:16,869 --> 01:24:18,069
And this has a kangaroo on it.

1739
01:24:18,869 --> 01:24:19,430
Hold on.

1740
01:24:19,430 --> 01:24:21,670
What about one gold coin?

1741
01:24:22,550 --> 01:24:24,470
Rhino with like a rhino on it.

1742
01:24:25,189 --> 01:24:31,670
What are the animals you can put on?

1743
01:24:31,670 --> 01:24:34,250
Gold coin praying mantis.

1744
01:24:34,810 --> 01:24:35,829
That's what I want.

1745
01:24:36,390 --> 01:24:45,180
You get a huge praying mantis gold coin.

1746
01:24:45,819 --> 01:24:50,149
What about a rat?

1747
01:24:50,149 --> 01:24:51,350
Gold coin rat.

1748
01:24:52,069 --> 01:24:53,800
I'm spinning on my own mouth.

1749
01:24:56,220 --> 01:24:56,619
Oh yeah.

1750
01:24:57,579 --> 01:24:58,939
It's like the year of the rat.

1751
01:24:58,939 --> 01:25:03,180
I could probably find like a, I'm going to get a one pound gold rat coin.

1752
01:25:03,899 --> 01:25:06,819
Why would I ever do that?

1753
01:25:08,869 --> 01:25:09,750
No, I'm going to get it.

1754
01:25:09,750 --> 01:25:13,430
I'm going to get a, um, what's the fool's gold stuff?

1755
01:25:13,430 --> 01:25:13,909
What's it called?

1756
01:25:13,909 --> 01:25:18,489
It's called, uh, arconite.

1757
01:25:19,899 --> 01:25:21,100
What's arconite, right?

1758
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:25,159
No, that's a warcraft ore.

1759
01:25:26,279 --> 01:25:26,840
Pyrite.

1760
01:25:28,550 --> 01:25:28,949
Okay.

1761
01:25:28,949 --> 01:25:29,909
Pyrite coin.

1762
01:25:30,789 --> 01:25:34,699
Perfect.

1763
01:25:34,699 --> 01:25:34,939
Yes.

1764
01:25:35,829 --> 01:25:36,069
Okay.

1765
01:25:36,069 --> 01:25:37,909
I'm going to get how much I'm going to talk.

1766
01:25:37,909 --> 01:25:40,310
I'm going to buy like three pounds of pyrite.

1767
01:25:41,029 --> 01:25:44,949
And I'm going to have it customly made into a giant coin like this big.

1768
01:25:48,699 --> 01:25:49,659
Pyrite coin.

1769
01:25:49,659 --> 01:25:50,539
How much is pyrite?

1770
01:25:50,539 --> 01:25:51,500
Pyrite an ounce.

1771
01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:54,899
Pyrite per ounce.

1772

Is this expensive?

It's fifteen fucking hundred dollars.

1774
01:26:01,829 --> 01:26:06,300
Why is this like the same amount of money?

1775
01:26:07,989 --> 01:26:08,390
Hold on.

1776
01:26:09,350 --> 01:26:10,119
All right.

1777
01:26:10,119 --> 01:26:12,279
What about gold plated?

1778
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:17,020
Should I just get like, should I just buy like a pound of zinc?

1779
01:26:18,579 --> 01:26:19,859
And then spray paint it gold?

1780
01:26:20,739 --> 01:26:21,380
How much do you get?

1781
01:26:21,380 --> 01:26:23,130
Zinc per ounce.

Graphite per ounce.

One pound of oven dry wood of any hardwood of a heat value.

01:26:58,020 --> 01:27:00,180
How, how, how is wood?

1798
01:27:00,180 --> 01:27:00,500
No.

1799
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:01,060
Okay.

1800
01:27:01,060 --> 01:27:02,340
This is what I just wrote.

1801
01:27:02,340 --> 01:27:03,939
This is what I just wrote into Google.

1802
01:27:03,939 --> 01:27:04,819
I don't know what happened.

1803
01:27:06,380 --> 01:27:07,100
That's what I just wrote.

1804
01:27:10,550 --> 01:27:11,829
How is wood per pound?

Okay.

Lumber price today.

1808
01:27:20,380 --> 01:27:21,819
What is the current price of lumber?

1810
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:25,659
Okay.

Good.

1812
01:27:27,340 --> 01:27:30,300
I'm going to get a bunch of lumber and I'm going to grind it up into a big coin

1813
01:27:30,300 --> 01:27:31,659

Nice.

1821
01:27:49,239 --> 01:27:54,979
Use grams.

1822
01:27:54,979 --> 01:27:55,300
What?

1823
01:27:55,859 --> 01:27:58,970
I can make anything gold.

1824
01:28:00,170 --> 01:28:00,649
Wait a minute.

1825
01:28:00,649 --> 01:28:05,130
Should I, should I spray paint my Wii gold?

1826
01:28:06,010 --> 01:28:10,539
Should I just spray paint my Wii and Xbox gold and just have gold stuff?

1827
01:28:11,340 --> 01:28:14,739
Why would you buy wood by the ounce?

1828
01:28:14,739 --> 01:28:15,699
I don't know.

1829
01:28:15,699 --> 01:28:16,739
That's the spot price.

1830
01:28:17,979 --> 01:28:19,500
Paint your teeth gold.

1831
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:29,000
Golden Shito.

1832
01:28:35,590 --> 01:28:36,630
I'm going to have a, all right.

1833
01:28:36,630 --> 01:28:38,069
I'm going to have a gold Wii.

1834
01:28:38,069 --> 01:28:39,829
I'm going to spray paint it with eight.

1835
01:28:39,829 --> 01:28:40,949
Will that damage the Wii?

1836
01:28:41,590 --> 01:28:42,649
No.

1837
01:28:42,649 --> 01:28:44,810
As long as I like put, like protect it, right?

1838
01:28:45,529 --> 01:28:46,090
No.

1839
01:28:46,090 --> 01:28:48,010
Well, why would spray painting a Wii damage it?

1840
01:28:48,010 --> 01:28:48,250
What?

1841
01:28:49,989 --> 01:28:54,069
If I cover the vents, cover the holes and then spray paint it gold.

1842
01:28:54,069 --> 01:28:54,310
What?

1843
01:28:54,310 --> 01:28:54,869
Who cares?

1844
01:28:55,670 --> 01:28:57,619
Cover the vent.

1845
01:28:57,619 --> 01:28:58,100
Yeah.

1846
01:28:58,100 --> 01:28:58,739
What?

1847
01:28:58,739 --> 01:29:00,579
You guys think I'm just going to spray paint the vents?

1848
01:29:01,220 --> 01:29:02,500
I think I'll never turn on.

1849
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:03,460
It's going to overheat.

1850
01:29:05,909 --> 01:29:07,829
Unscrew the plastic first.

1851
01:29:07,829 --> 01:29:08,149
Yeah.

1852
01:29:08,149 --> 01:29:08,390
Okay.

1853
01:29:08,390 --> 01:29:09,350
That's probably a better idea.

1854
01:29:09,909 --> 01:29:11,189
This is from the iPhone thing.

1855
01:29:11,989 --> 01:29:16,840
I bought a chocolate dipped Wii.

1856
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:21,989
Let's skip ahead in the soundtrack.

1857
01:29:21,989 --> 01:29:26,310
This is, everybody looks like this in their iPhone.

1858
01:29:26,869 --> 01:29:29,430
This is awesome though.

1859
01:29:29,430 --> 01:29:29,750
Thank you.

1860
01:29:30,470 --> 01:29:33,699
It's Murius, of course.

1861
01:29:33,699 --> 01:29:36,579
I think we've seen this image before, but I got to showcase it again.

1862
01:29:36,579 --> 01:29:37,619
Everybody loves Murius.

1863
01:29:41,449 --> 01:29:42,810
How could you not like Murius?

1864
01:29:43,770 --> 01:29:44,970
That's my question.

1865
01:29:44,970 --> 01:29:51,180
That's not the name of this.

1866
01:29:51,180 --> 01:29:59,289
That's the name of this cow is Murius because Murius is curious, but also furious.

1867
01:29:59,930 --> 01:30:01,979
It's so good.

1868
01:30:01,979 --> 01:30:03,819
Like such a good name.

1869
01:30:03,819 --> 01:30:10,069
You guys are using like a meme name that is like apparently fucked up.

1870
01:30:10,069 --> 01:30:25,479
Not the cow's name.

1871
01:30:25,479 --> 01:30:27,210
That's not the cow's name.

1872
01:30:28,100 --> 01:30:30,500
This is great image, but that's not the cow's name.

1873
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:31,619
How's name is Murius.

1874
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:33,159
Change it.

1875
01:30:33,159 --> 01:30:33,880
I okay.

1876
01:30:35,659 --> 01:30:36,140
Good draw.

1877
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:38,489
It's good art though.

1878
01:30:38,489 --> 01:30:43,050
Throw rocks, throw rocks, start stream on time or draw 25.

1879
01:30:43,689 --> 01:30:48,810
This is good.

1880
01:30:48,810 --> 01:30:50,010
This is very, very good.

1881
01:30:50,649 --> 01:30:53,500
You even got the boomer brace there too.

1882
01:30:57,420 --> 01:30:59,579
20, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

1883
01:31:03,430 --> 01:31:04,869
This is a very, very good image.

1884
01:31:05,510 --> 01:31:08,979
It's great.

1885
01:31:09,619 --> 01:31:15,159
What was the messed up name he's talking about?

1886
01:31:16,039 --> 01:31:19,239
Don't just don't tell them because like I don't want to be the reason

1887
01:31:19,239 --> 01:31:21,319
why that person starts searching shit.

1888
01:31:22,199 --> 01:31:26,359
I like, I don't, I, the stream is not going to be like a place for people to like,

1889
01:31:26,359 --> 01:31:28,520
oh, hey, let's talk about like fucking weird shit.

1890
01:31:33,189 --> 01:31:33,750
Oh, all right.

1891
01:31:33,750 --> 01:31:34,149
Whatever.

1892
01:31:34,149 --> 01:31:35,510
Don't Google anything.

1893
01:31:37,159 --> 01:31:38,279
Don't Google anything ever.

1894
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:44,539
Here's the thing.

1895
01:31:44,539 --> 01:31:46,380
I don't know if that's my face or not.

1896
01:31:47,689 --> 01:31:48,649
Is that me?

1897
01:31:48,649 --> 01:31:49,449
I don't know.

1898
01:31:49,449 --> 01:31:50,569
Is this just the poster?

1899
01:31:51,289 --> 01:31:54,500
I think this is just the poster.

1900
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:55,619
I don't think that's even my face.

1901
01:31:56,340 --> 01:32:03,939
Although that would be like, I don't know.

1902
01:32:03,939 --> 01:32:04,659
That would make sense.

1903
01:32:04,659 --> 01:32:05,619
That would be weird.

1904
01:32:05,619 --> 01:32:06,579
The mouth is mine.

1905
01:32:07,930 --> 01:32:08,250
Is it?

1906
01:32:12,140 --> 01:32:21,420
I guess a cast of thousands, thousands of people in this movie.

1907
01:32:22,060 --> 01:32:24,170
Is this public domain?

1908
01:32:24,170 --> 01:32:24,810
Can we watch this?

1909
01:32:25,369 --> 01:32:30,199
Is it public domain?

1910
01:32:31,079 --> 01:32:32,359
Let's see if it's actually me in that.

1911
01:32:34,810 --> 01:32:36,970
I mean, it's not, I'm not fucking.

1912
01:32:37,050 --> 01:32:38,810
90 fucking thousand years old.

1913
01:32:47,100 --> 01:32:47,819
Pretty good.

1914
01:32:47,819 --> 01:32:48,699
Pretty good.

1915
01:32:48,699 --> 01:32:54,710
I like, I like what you did here.

1916
01:32:57,529 --> 01:32:59,050
You skipped the song.

1917
01:32:59,770 --> 01:33:01,479
I did it again.

1918
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:03,640
This is fucking awesome, though.

1919
01:33:04,359 --> 01:33:05,159
Mustache here.

1920
01:33:07,369 --> 01:33:07,930
Nice work.

1921
01:33:07,930 --> 01:33:08,810
Bloodborne McGee.

1922
01:33:09,689 --> 01:33:14,760
Can I go back to short hair?

1923
01:33:20,819 --> 01:33:21,699
I don't know.

1924
01:33:21,699 --> 01:33:25,460
Let's see what I look.

1925
01:33:25,460 --> 01:33:27,460
I mean, I'm using this as if this is what,

1926
01:33:27,460 --> 01:33:28,659
this is a real image of my face.

1927
01:33:28,659 --> 01:33:31,140
But I mean, it's like, I kind of miss this.

1928
01:33:46,229 --> 01:33:46,470
All right.

1929
01:33:46,470 --> 01:33:47,510
This is, this is a poll.

1930
01:33:52,789 --> 01:33:53,510
Making it right now.

1931
01:34:25,159 --> 01:34:26,039
Flip your coin.

1932
01:34:26,039 --> 01:34:26,840
I don't have one yet.

1933
01:34:28,119 --> 01:34:33,859
Okay.

1934
01:34:33,859 --> 01:34:36,470
Wow.

1935
01:34:36,470 --> 01:34:38,149
This is, this is getting a lot of votes.

1936
01:34:38,869 --> 01:34:42,220
Okay.

1937
01:34:42,220 --> 01:34:42,460
Nice.

1938
01:34:43,100 --> 01:34:44,220
Thousand votes.

1939
01:34:44,220 --> 01:34:46,460
This, we don't break a thousand votes on these polls.

1940
01:34:46,460 --> 01:34:46,779
Ever.

1941
01:34:47,420 --> 01:34:47,739
Ever.

1942
01:34:52,199 --> 01:34:52,760
All right.

1943
01:34:52,760 --> 01:34:57,829
Buy the coin and flip it.

1944
01:34:57,829 --> 01:34:58,789
I need to get one first.

1945
01:34:59,430 --> 01:35:02,340
Link it again.

1946
01:35:02,340 --> 01:35:02,819
Link it again.

1947
01:35:02,819 --> 01:35:03,060
Link.

1948
01:35:03,060 --> 01:35:03,380
All right.

1949
01:35:03,380 --> 01:35:04,260
Here, here, here, here.

1950
01:35:08,729 --> 01:35:09,369
There, there, there.

1951
01:35:09,369 --> 01:35:09,930
Look, look, look.

1952
01:35:10,569 --> 01:35:12,859
This is going to break like 1500 votes.

1953
01:35:12,859 --> 01:35:13,500
It never happens.

1954
01:35:19,819 --> 01:35:20,460
Okay.

1955
01:35:20,460 --> 01:35:26,149
Almost a 2000 votes.

1956
01:35:26,149 --> 01:35:28,470
So you guys, you guys are going nuts.

1957
01:35:29,430 --> 01:35:31,079
All right.

1958
01:35:31,079 --> 01:35:31,800
10 more seconds.

1959
01:35:36,699 --> 01:35:38,060
Gold spray paint here.

1960
01:35:41,880 --> 01:35:42,199
Okay.

1961
01:35:43,750 --> 01:35:45,029
And we're going back to short here.

1962
01:35:45,909 --> 01:35:48,250
I'm glad that I put up the meme filter.

1963
01:35:48,250 --> 01:35:49,850
We could get a real accurate statement

1964
01:35:49,850 --> 01:35:51,449
of what people really thought would be better.

1965
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:57,239
Going back to short here.

1966
01:35:57,239 --> 01:35:59,140
I was going to anyways, yeah.

1967
01:35:59,140 --> 01:36:00,500
Thanks for the confirmation, visor.

1968
01:36:01,060 --> 01:36:06,579
Appreciate it.

1969
01:36:07,220 --> 01:36:09,460
Thanks for the vote.

1970
01:36:09,460 --> 01:36:14,500
This is another one.

1971
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:16,739
I just like, it made me chuckle for some reason.

1972
01:36:16,739 --> 01:36:17,300
I don't know why.

1973
01:36:19,060 --> 01:36:20,579
It's just, I look, it made me chuckle.

1974
01:36:21,220 --> 01:36:22,680
This is the BB unit.

1975
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:22,920
Yes.

1976
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:24,840
By the way, what the hell?

1977
01:36:26,340 --> 01:36:26,659
Why?

1978
01:36:27,779 --> 01:36:28,899
I guess that's like illegal.

1979
01:36:30,550 --> 01:36:31,829
Yeah, it's like, that's illegal.

1980
01:36:31,829 --> 01:36:33,750
That's like, it's the movie came out literally

1981
01:36:34,310 --> 01:36:34,949
a few, like what?

1982
01:36:34,949 --> 01:36:35,590
Three years ago.

1983
01:36:36,229 --> 01:36:37,590
It just like dubbed me over.

1984
01:36:38,310 --> 01:36:39,029
Now that's illegal.

1985
01:36:39,029 --> 01:36:39,590
Nevermind.

1986
01:36:39,590 --> 01:36:40,310
Can't do that one.

1987
01:36:41,510 --> 01:36:43,460
Uh, this is from the cooking mama stream.

1988
01:36:44,180 --> 01:36:45,779
It was just, uh, I made a pizza

1989
01:36:45,779 --> 01:36:47,939
and it was a shitload of shit.

1990
01:36:47,939 --> 01:36:50,020
Why do people always use this image too?

1991
01:36:51,140 --> 01:36:55,659
It was a corn and strawberry pizza.

1992
01:36:57,560 --> 01:36:59,399
It's a Bitcoin miner.

1993
01:37:00,199 --> 01:37:01,159
That's false.

1994
01:37:01,159 --> 01:37:02,119
That's fake.

1995
01:37:02,119 --> 01:37:03,399
I don't want to push that

1996
01:37:03,399 --> 01:37:04,520
because that's not even real.

1997
01:37:05,399 --> 01:37:06,199
But it doesn't matter.

1998
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:21,529
Oh, oh, this is the kind of shit

1999
01:37:21,529 --> 01:37:22,970
that you frame and put on your wall.

2000
01:37:23,689 --> 01:37:25,539
And people just assume that this is

2001
01:37:25,539 --> 01:37:26,979
something really, really interesting.

2002
01:37:28,229 --> 01:37:28,789
Oh, wow.

2003
01:37:29,430 --> 01:37:30,630
I won't do that what that is.

2004
01:37:31,829 --> 01:37:33,750
That's in, oh, put that up on your wall.

2005
01:37:33,750 --> 01:37:35,510
And I have a lot of, I'm going to walk by that

2006
01:37:35,510 --> 01:37:36,789
and be like, holy shit.

2007
01:37:36,789 --> 01:37:38,789
That's really interesting and cool to me.

2008
01:37:38,789 --> 01:37:39,829
Even though I don't know what that is.

2009
01:37:41,029 --> 01:37:41,529
Perfect.

2010
01:37:41,989 --> 01:37:47,579
Viewers are plummeting because of this.

2011
01:37:47,579 --> 01:37:48,300
He didn't even talk.

2012
01:37:48,939 --> 01:37:51,220
It's just an image of his face.

2013
01:37:51,859 --> 01:37:58,979
This is great though.

2014
01:37:58,979 --> 01:37:59,619
I love it.

2015
01:37:59,619 --> 01:38:02,170
This is very frameable.

2016
01:38:02,170 --> 01:38:03,210
Very frameable.

2017
01:38:03,210 --> 01:38:13,210
The music is perfect right now.

2018
01:38:13,210 --> 01:38:13,710
Yeah, it is.

2019
01:38:15,939 --> 01:38:17,060
Uh, these are different, um,

2020
01:38:17,060 --> 01:38:18,340
stances of mine, apparently.

2021
01:38:18,340 --> 01:38:19,060
I just thought they would,

2022
01:38:19,060 --> 01:38:20,340
I thought they were cool.

2023
01:38:20,340 --> 01:38:22,659
I mean, I like, I dream of having powers.

2024
01:38:23,380 --> 01:38:24,260
No, everybody does.

2025
01:38:33,369 --> 01:38:35,210
I mean, it's just like, uh, it's like,

2026
01:38:35,210 --> 01:38:36,090
it's cute to me.

2027
01:38:36,090 --> 01:38:37,050
Like, I like it.

2028
01:38:37,050 --> 01:38:39,670
Press Z and wait.

2029
01:38:39,670 --> 01:38:41,750
Dr. Seuss is from, uh, Chibi-Robo.

2030
01:38:44,939 --> 01:38:47,590
I just, it's irritating.

2031
01:38:47,590 --> 01:38:48,649
Okay, we're good.

2032
01:38:49,449 --> 01:38:51,369
It's adorable.

2033
01:38:55,060 --> 01:38:55,859
Play this again.

2034
01:38:56,659 --> 01:38:57,300
I can't.

2035
01:38:57,300 --> 01:38:58,420
It's, I already did.

2036
01:38:58,420 --> 01:38:59,060
I played it all.

2037
01:38:59,060 --> 01:38:59,699
I beat it all.

2038
01:39:00,500 --> 01:39:01,859
It was so good.

2039
01:39:01,859 --> 01:39:03,060
It was awesome.

2040
01:39:03,060 --> 01:39:04,819
And I, I, I can just play it again.

2041
01:39:04,819 --> 01:39:09,060
Five years can go by and I can do it again.

2042
01:39:09,060 --> 01:39:11,449
What about the sequel?

2043
01:39:11,449 --> 01:39:13,449
Yeah, but I have to get a Nintendo DS.

2044
01:39:14,329 --> 01:39:21,180
Um, oh, it's a 1920s movie camera.

2045
01:39:21,180 --> 01:39:23,579
Uh, emulate a DSer thing.

2046
01:39:24,550 --> 01:39:26,869
Um, the thing, a way to play,

2047
01:39:26,869 --> 01:39:28,949
to put it through to my computer.

2048
01:39:30,420 --> 01:39:31,220
Just emulate it.

2049
01:39:31,220 --> 01:39:32,260
Just emulate it.

2050
01:39:32,260 --> 01:39:33,460
Just emulate it.

2051
01:39:33,460 --> 01:39:34,420
Just emulate it.

2052
01:39:35,300 --> 01:39:36,340
Just emulate it.

2053
01:39:36,340 --> 01:39:39,619
Just get every game for free and just emulate, dude.

2054
01:39:39,619 --> 01:39:40,180
Just do it.

2055
01:39:40,180 --> 01:39:42,260
I, what is, what do you got to, where are you afraid?

2056
01:39:42,260 --> 01:39:43,140
Just emulate everything.

2057
01:39:43,140 --> 01:39:44,420
Just don't buy any games.

2058
01:39:50,819 --> 01:39:51,460
Illegal.

2059
01:40:01,819 --> 01:40:02,300
So what?

2060
01:40:03,880 --> 01:40:09,350
Hey, I own it.

2061
01:40:09,350 --> 01:40:11,189
Look, I, I own it.

2062
01:40:11,750 --> 01:40:13,300
I own the console.

2063
01:40:13,300 --> 01:40:13,939
I own the disc.

2064
01:40:15,560 --> 01:40:16,119
I own it.

2065
01:40:21,939 --> 01:40:22,979
Hey, you printed that.

2066
01:40:22,979 --> 01:40:23,460
Oh yeah?

2067
01:40:24,340 --> 01:40:31,060
What are all these games?

2068
01:40:33,979 --> 01:40:36,619
New Avengers, Captain America, Fantastic Four, Iron Man,

2069
01:40:36,619 --> 01:40:37,579
Young Avengers.

2070
01:40:38,140 --> 01:40:43,079
Who's Young Avengers?

2071
01:40:43,720 --> 01:40:49,020
Is it a, how, what game is that?

2072
01:40:49,819 --> 01:40:55,689
Like, is that a game I can play?

2073
01:40:56,409 --> 01:40:57,289
Did I get scammed?

2074
01:40:57,289 --> 01:40:58,090
No, I didn't.

2075
01:40:58,090 --> 01:41:01,779
I'm, look, teacher's copy versus what they give you.

2076
01:41:05,500 --> 01:41:06,699
I hate that image even more.

2077
01:41:07,260 --> 01:41:14,310
It's just scary.

2078
01:41:14,310 --> 01:41:14,789
It's scary.

2079
01:41:14,789 --> 01:41:16,310
Like, why, why did you animate the eyes?

2080
01:41:16,869 --> 01:41:19,369
I love this too.

2081
01:41:19,369 --> 01:41:23,420
It's Chibi-Robo and Fireman.

2082
01:41:24,140 --> 01:41:25,180
Together at last.

2083
01:41:28,729 --> 01:41:29,289
At last.

2084
01:41:30,010 --> 01:41:34,890
Look out.

2085
01:41:34,890 --> 01:41:36,329
It's gonna impale him.

2086
01:41:37,050 --> 01:41:38,310
Why?

2087
01:41:38,310 --> 01:41:39,029
What?

2088
01:41:39,029 --> 01:41:45,210
This OST is too stressful.

2089
01:41:45,210 --> 01:41:56,340
All right, I'll put on fucking relaxation music.

2090
01:41:57,140 --> 01:42:02,020
Has this channel ever been offline?

2091
01:42:03,220 --> 01:42:05,539
Lo-Fi Hip-Hop Beats to Relax 2.

2092
01:42:05,539 --> 01:42:06,659
This channel, I think, is live.

2093
01:42:09,899 --> 01:42:11,819
I think it's, it's literally never been turned off.

2094
01:42:11,819 --> 01:42:18,779
But that's crazy.

2095
01:42:19,979 --> 01:42:22,090
It went offline once.

2096
01:42:22,090 --> 01:42:22,729
Only once.

2097
01:42:24,010 --> 01:42:24,810
Holy shit.

2098
01:42:24,810 --> 01:42:26,010
How many computers do you have?

2099
01:42:26,649 --> 01:42:29,770
How many fucking computers do you have to be able to keep that going?

2100
01:42:32,939 --> 01:42:34,699
Relaxing, how about flute music?

2101
01:42:37,220 --> 01:42:38,579
Mario music.

2102
01:42:39,140 --> 01:42:41,180
This one has a dog on it.

2103
01:42:41,180 --> 01:42:42,779
Classical music for relaxation.

2104
01:42:43,659 --> 01:42:44,140
Chopping.

2105
01:42:44,939 --> 01:42:46,380
Beethoven, oh, no, no, no, no, no.

2106
01:42:46,380 --> 01:42:50,300
That's, that's chopping is the, all right, let's try it.

2107
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,399
Did we go over how this is surgery music?

2108
01:43:06,279 --> 01:43:11,479
I can't listen to classical music because it's surgery music.

2109
01:43:11,479 --> 01:43:17,289
Do we ever talk about that?

2110
01:43:18,010 --> 01:43:18,810
Have I ever gone over this?

2111
01:43:18,810 --> 01:43:19,449
Why?

2112
01:43:19,449 --> 01:43:24,199
I have, right?

2113
01:43:24,199 --> 01:43:26,470
I've never gone over this.

2114
01:43:26,470 --> 01:43:27,270
Explain, explain.

2115
01:43:29,750 --> 01:43:31,510
Okay, so yeah, like dentist music.

2116
01:43:31,510 --> 01:43:34,810
Yeah, I want, I, I had my wisdom teeth pulled.

2117
01:43:35,529 --> 01:43:38,329
And I was kind of put under anesthesia for it.

2118
01:43:39,289 --> 01:43:41,210
And this music was just playing.

2119
01:43:42,539 --> 01:43:46,539
Guy just had classical music playing while he was pulling my teeth.

2120
01:43:47,829 --> 01:43:50,470
And it was crazy because like, obviously you could, you get,

2121
01:43:50,470 --> 01:43:53,109
when I was putting, getting put under the sedation, it was like,

2122
01:43:54,359 --> 01:43:56,359
the song, it was scary.

2123
01:43:58,520 --> 01:44:04,840
It was like going, and that's just classical, classical, classical.

2124
01:44:05,479 --> 01:44:08,789
This is surgery music.

2125
01:44:09,430 --> 01:44:13,109
I've had two procedures and there's, this always plays.

2126
01:44:13,750 --> 01:44:16,899
There's always like a fucking surgery song.

2127
01:44:16,899 --> 01:44:28,229
Yeah, like this is like, and they like get in there and

2128
01:44:29,109 --> 01:44:36,869
Hannibal did that.

2129
01:44:39,060 --> 01:44:39,859
See, right?

2130
01:44:40,420 --> 01:44:43,260
He's got a classical music phobia.

2131
01:44:43,260 --> 01:44:51,430
And I think it gets angry too.

2132
01:44:52,390 --> 01:44:54,149
You know, you notice how it's like boom.

2133
01:44:54,149 --> 01:44:57,270
You can tell when he like fucking pushes hard down on the fucking keys.

2134
01:44:57,270 --> 01:44:57,829
Listen, ready?

2135
01:44:58,390 --> 01:45:03,539
It's like, you can hear his hands hit the bottom of the wood on the piano.

2136
01:45:04,100 --> 01:45:06,300
Where is it?

2137
01:45:09,020 --> 01:45:10,310
Where is it?

2138
01:45:10,310 --> 01:45:19,779
You can feel the wood getting hit.

2139
01:45:33,800 --> 01:45:34,359
It's angry.

2140
01:45:35,560 --> 01:45:36,119
I don't like it.

2141
01:45:37,640 --> 01:45:38,199
It's wonderful.

2142
01:45:38,840 --> 01:45:43,800
It's created so magically and the skill that it takes to be able to do that.

2143
01:45:43,800 --> 01:45:47,960
And the concentration and how it flows against like a story in a song.

2144
01:45:47,960 --> 01:45:48,439
I get it.

2145
01:45:48,439 --> 01:45:52,680
But I've had my, I've had teeth pulled twice and the surgery music.

2146
01:45:52,680 --> 01:45:53,720
And I think that's all I can think of now.

2147
01:45:54,279 --> 01:46:01,699
It's beautiful.

2148
01:46:03,060 --> 01:46:05,180
Play MF Doom.

2149
01:46:05,819 --> 01:46:06,979
That's copyright.

2150
01:46:08,020 --> 01:46:10,739
That's copyright.

2151
01:46:11,939 --> 01:46:16,699
I mean, too bad.

2152
01:46:16,699 --> 01:46:17,199
What?

2153
01:46:17,659 --> 01:46:25,609
Hey, play copyright music.

2154
01:46:25,609 --> 01:46:26,569
No, too bad.

2155
01:46:27,369 --> 01:46:28,140
Okay.

2156
01:46:28,140 --> 01:46:29,420
Anything else you like me to do?

2157
01:46:30,140 --> 01:46:30,640
Okay.

2158
01:46:31,180 --> 01:46:31,680
Sure.

2159
01:46:32,460 --> 01:46:34,470
Do a movie soundtrack.

2160
01:46:34,470 --> 01:46:34,710
All right.

2161
01:46:34,710 --> 01:46:35,750
How about Inception?

2162
01:46:36,390 --> 01:46:53,130
Now, this is surgery music.

2163
01:46:53,130 --> 01:46:54,090
I don't like it.

2164
01:46:54,090 --> 01:46:56,090
That's surgery music.

2165
01:46:56,090 --> 01:46:56,590
I don't like it.

2166
01:46:58,659 --> 01:46:59,880
That's copyrighted.

2167
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:00,199
Fuck.

2168
01:47:00,199 --> 01:47:00,600
I know.

2169
01:47:01,239 --> 01:47:01,720
All right.

2170
01:47:01,720 --> 01:47:03,640
How about put on jazz?

2171
01:47:03,640 --> 01:47:05,159
Jazz royalty free.

2172
01:47:05,800 --> 01:47:09,140
Coffee house jazz.

2173
01:47:15,050 --> 01:47:19,960
Go ahead and pull up to the coffee shop.

2174
01:47:19,960 --> 01:47:20,920
All right.

2175
01:47:20,920 --> 01:47:25,159
Just find your self standing in line.

2176
01:47:25,159 --> 01:47:27,159
Getting to order a nice hot cup of coffee.

2177
01:47:27,800 --> 01:47:29,689
You got it.

2178
01:47:30,329 --> 01:47:31,289
What's that smell?

2179
01:47:31,289 --> 01:47:31,930
Cappuccino.

2180
01:47:32,489 --> 01:47:33,689
Freshly brewed.

2181
01:47:33,689 --> 01:47:38,100
You look around the coffee shop and you look for a place to sit down.

2182
01:47:38,100 --> 01:47:40,100
But something catches your eye.

2183
01:47:41,260 --> 01:47:46,779
And every single available seat is a man or woman with their computer.

2184
01:47:48,060 --> 01:47:52,380
And they may have been sitting there for two to three hours at this point.

2185
01:47:52,380 --> 01:47:54,939
No place to sit.

2186
01:47:56,340 --> 01:47:58,659
Just computers and typing sounds.

2187
01:47:59,300 --> 01:48:04,779
You think to say, how long have these people been here for?

2188
01:48:06,859 --> 01:48:09,020
And is my money worth the same as theirs?

2189
01:48:09,020 --> 01:48:11,510
But you don't.

2190
01:48:11,510 --> 01:48:12,310
You just walk out.

2191
01:48:13,619 --> 01:48:14,739
Thought you'd like to have a seat.

2192
01:48:15,300 --> 01:48:18,890
But you can't.

2193
01:48:18,890 --> 01:48:20,090
You take that coffee into the car.

2194
01:48:21,939 --> 01:48:26,020
You sit down and you figure out, how am I going to drink this coffee in this car?

2195
01:48:27,399 --> 01:48:28,119
Gosh.

2196
01:48:28,119 --> 01:48:29,000
You turn the engine on.

2197
01:48:29,560 --> 01:48:31,369
Oh, what's that?

2198
01:48:31,369 --> 01:48:32,810
You put it down in the cup holder.

2199
01:48:32,810 --> 01:48:34,090
A little bit spilt on your hand.

2200
01:48:35,609 --> 01:48:36,329
Dripped on the ground.

2201
01:48:37,050 --> 01:48:38,569
Nice leather.

2202
01:48:39,210 --> 01:48:40,779
Car's got to get detailed now.

2203
01:48:42,710 --> 01:48:44,090
Chucks.

2204
01:48:44,090 --> 01:48:46,810
Really would have liked a seat at that coffee shop.

2205
01:48:47,770 --> 01:48:50,359
You repeat in your head over and over again as you drive.

2206
01:48:51,159 --> 01:48:51,720
Angry now.

2207
01:48:52,279 --> 01:48:54,899
Coffee's supposed to relax you and slow you down.

2208
01:48:55,699 --> 01:48:57,829
Except that's absolutely not true.

2209
01:48:57,829 --> 01:48:58,949
Caffeine makes you speed up.

2210
01:49:00,250 --> 01:49:00,729
Slow down.

2211
01:49:01,449 --> 01:49:03,180
It's a red light.

2212
01:49:12,010 --> 01:49:13,050
I don't want, I don't like that music.

2213
01:49:14,010 --> 01:49:15,189
All right.

2214
01:49:15,189 --> 01:49:15,670
That's better.

2215
01:49:16,979 --> 01:49:18,020
He's not insane.

2216
01:49:18,899 --> 01:49:27,100
Would you get the Evangelion figurines?

2217
01:49:27,100 --> 01:49:28,380
I, I fucking eBay.

2218
01:49:28,380 --> 01:49:28,699
I don't know.

2219
01:49:28,699 --> 01:49:29,100
Look them up.

2220
01:49:29,739 --> 01:49:33,670
Irma, do funny, do funny, do funny.

2221
01:49:33,670 --> 01:49:35,829
This is, why is this just like my life?

2222
01:49:37,979 --> 01:49:39,020
Not insane.

2223
01:49:39,659 --> 01:49:40,939
And that's the Spider-Man meme.

2224
01:49:41,579 --> 01:49:47,829
Irma, what, like 35 minutes into my ass, a gnome is just sitting there.

2225
01:49:48,789 --> 01:49:49,989
But that's out of context.

2226
01:49:50,630 --> 01:49:52,600
We were, that's out of context.

2227
01:49:52,600 --> 01:49:53,239
I got to, hold on.

2228
01:49:53,239 --> 01:49:55,020
Let me defend myself on that.

2229
01:49:55,020 --> 01:49:58,140
That's what I was talking about if I streamed my colonoscopy.

2230
01:49:59,189 --> 01:50:03,189
And if elaborate, just elaborately, somewhere on that video.

2231
01:50:03,189 --> 01:50:05,590
After like, because a colonoscopy takes like half an hour.

2232
01:50:06,229 --> 01:50:08,630
That I just put a gnome on in there.

2233
01:50:08,630 --> 01:50:10,710
Like not in, not obviously not in there.

2234
01:50:10,789 --> 01:50:12,069
But like on the screen.

2235
01:50:12,069 --> 01:50:15,750
Like there was just a gnome like going through the colonoscopy is real boring.

2236
01:50:15,750 --> 01:50:17,510
It's just a, it's just a tunnel.

2237
01:50:19,399 --> 01:50:21,560
And all this, it's okay.

2238
01:50:21,560 --> 01:50:24,760
It's just, we're just in this guy's intestines.

2239
01:50:24,760 --> 01:50:27,399
Oh, there's a, there's a gnome there and they just pass it.

2240
01:50:29,529 --> 01:50:30,970
This needs to be context here.

2241
01:50:31,939 --> 01:50:32,659
I'm not crazy.

2242
01:50:33,460 --> 01:50:33,939
Context.

2243
01:50:34,739 --> 01:50:35,300
This is great.

2244
01:50:35,939 --> 01:50:54,819
Pretty good.

2245
01:50:54,819 --> 01:50:57,109
Oh, we've got Jazzy in here.

2246
01:51:00,500 --> 01:51:01,300
Is this the Hulk?

2247
01:51:02,020 --> 01:51:04,659
Um, I don't think so.

2248
01:51:04,659 --> 01:51:05,220
The Hulk.

2249
01:51:07,800 --> 01:51:08,840
It's green meat.

2250
01:51:09,800 --> 01:51:10,520
It's the Grinch.

2251
01:51:13,180 --> 01:51:14,060
It's the Grinch.

2252
01:51:14,939 --> 01:51:18,310
It looks great.

2253
01:51:18,310 --> 01:51:18,630
Whatever.

2254
01:51:18,630 --> 01:51:19,430
It looks great.

2255
01:51:20,899 --> 01:51:21,539
Love the eyes.

2256
01:51:25,750 --> 01:51:26,390
Well, I don't know.

2257
01:51:27,270 --> 01:51:28,149
It's Beast Boy.

2258
01:51:28,149 --> 01:51:29,270
It's whoever you want it to be.

2259
01:51:30,229 --> 01:51:31,350
Use your imagination.

2260
01:51:35,100 --> 01:51:35,739
Great.

2261
01:51:35,739 --> 01:51:37,500
Top 1000 stream.

2262
01:51:37,500 --> 01:51:38,140
What am I at now?

2263
01:51:38,779 --> 01:51:41,319
What am I at now?

2264
01:51:42,039 --> 01:51:47,100
What is it?

2265
01:51:47,100 --> 01:51:48,859
Well, I was a top 1000 stream before.

2266
01:51:49,340 --> 01:51:50,380
What's the, what's the rank now?

2267
01:51:50,380 --> 01:51:50,939
What am I at now?

2268
01:51:52,300 --> 01:51:53,260
Did I go down or up?

2269
01:51:54,140 --> 01:52:00,090
I was at like 840 or something, right?

2270
01:52:00,090 --> 01:52:00,890
810.

2271
01:52:01,770 --> 01:52:03,479
I went down.

2272
01:52:06,359 --> 01:52:07,720
467.

2273
01:52:08,359 --> 01:52:10,680
Wait, I jumped up to 467?

2274
01:52:16,710 --> 01:52:17,430
Did I?

2275
01:52:17,430 --> 01:52:22,329
I don't think we, is that real?

2276
01:52:23,130 --> 01:52:25,899
I think we have to, we have to get rid of this top 1000 streamer.

2277
01:52:25,899 --> 01:52:27,420
We're going to have to go with top 500.

2278
01:52:28,060 --> 01:52:29,100
Top 500 streamer.

2279
01:52:32,520 --> 01:52:34,489
Okay.

2280
01:52:34,489 --> 01:52:36,729
You're at 808 for follower rank.

2281
01:52:37,529 --> 01:52:39,619
Top 476.

2282
01:52:44,460 --> 01:52:44,779
Nice.

2283
01:52:45,659 --> 01:52:46,460
Top 500.

2284
01:52:47,180 --> 01:52:48,140
I'm 500.

2285
01:52:51,460 --> 01:52:51,779
Yeah.

2286
01:52:53,689 --> 01:52:55,289
I, I, I did it.

2287
01:52:56,090 --> 01:52:56,729
I did it.

2288
01:52:57,979 --> 01:52:58,619
I did it.

2289
01:52:59,850 --> 01:53:00,350
Me.

2290
01:53:01,050 --> 01:53:09,239
Hey, look, it's Pluto.

2291
01:53:09,239 --> 01:53:10,439
Ego fucking mania.

2292
01:53:11,500 --> 01:53:13,100
Hey, it's Pluto in 1994.

2293
01:53:13,100 --> 01:53:14,300
Now we got a good image of it.

2294
01:53:17,770 --> 01:53:18,409
Bury me.

2295
01:53:18,409 --> 01:53:19,689
Bury me with my money.

2296
01:53:19,689 --> 01:53:21,289
Bury me with my sub count.

2297
01:53:24,579 --> 01:53:26,899
Thank you, East Waffles, for the fives.

2298
01:53:28,069 --> 01:53:28,390
Money.

2299
01:53:29,029 --> 01:53:31,060
Thanks for the five community subs.

2300
01:53:31,060 --> 01:53:33,859
Thank you, Ms. Jackie, for the five community subs.

2301
01:53:34,500 --> 01:53:35,479
Money.

2302
01:53:39,079 --> 01:53:39,399
Yes.

2303
01:53:42,520 --> 01:53:44,680
Five, his ego's getting bigger.

2304
01:53:45,850 --> 01:53:46,729
No, it's not.

2305
01:53:46,729 --> 01:53:47,369
I'm just kidding.

2306
01:53:47,369 --> 01:53:47,930
It's a joke.

2307
01:53:51,239 --> 01:53:52,680
That's Pluto in 2018.

2308
01:53:52,680 --> 01:53:53,880
Can we see some Pluto's please?

2309
01:53:55,159 --> 01:53:55,960
Music's too loud.

2310
01:53:55,960 --> 01:53:58,520
I'm just, I can't find the right place for it.

2311
01:53:58,520 --> 01:54:01,159
Half this soundtrack is really loud and half it's really soft.

2312
01:54:07,609 --> 01:54:08,489
There it is.

2313
01:54:08,489 --> 01:54:11,079
Pluto.

2314
01:54:11,079 --> 01:54:11,800
Would you look at this?

2315
01:54:13,189 --> 01:54:14,710
I gotta get off camera for this one so you can see it.

2316
01:54:15,750 --> 01:54:17,270
This is my D&D character.

2317
01:54:17,909 --> 01:54:21,159
Rat King German, 985th of his name.

2318
01:54:22,520 --> 01:54:23,079
Stats.

2319
01:54:23,079 --> 01:54:23,560
TV.

2320
01:54:23,560 --> 01:54:24,039
Strength.

2321
01:54:25,140 --> 01:54:26,020
Strength is TV.

2322
01:54:26,020 --> 01:54:27,220
Dexterity is dab.

2323
01:54:27,220 --> 01:54:28,340
Constitution is heart.

2324
01:54:28,899 --> 01:54:30,020
Intelligence is high.

2325
01:54:30,020 --> 01:54:30,500
Wisdom.

2326
01:54:30,500 --> 01:54:31,060
Oh, I see.

2327
01:54:33,399 --> 01:54:33,880
Alignment.

2328
01:54:33,880 --> 01:54:34,600
Chaotic evil.

2329
01:54:34,600 --> 01:54:35,079
That's not true.

2330
01:54:37,619 --> 01:54:40,220
Oh, I have disciplined emotional.

2331
01:54:41,020 --> 01:54:42,140
Halfling Warlock.

2332
01:54:46,329 --> 01:54:47,289
Play your name.

2333
01:54:47,289 --> 01:54:47,770
Whatever.

2334
01:54:47,850 --> 01:54:48,170
Height.

2335
01:54:48,170 --> 01:54:48,810
Compact.

2336
01:54:51,979 --> 01:54:52,619
Inventory.

2337
01:54:52,619 --> 01:54:53,819
Crown of bits.

2338
01:54:53,819 --> 01:54:55,500
A crown made, let's see.

2339
01:54:55,500 --> 01:54:56,619
Let's get in there so you can see.

2340
01:54:57,720 --> 01:55:01,239
Crown made of bits that were generously donated by fans.

2341
01:55:01,239 --> 01:55:06,520
The unnecessarily large size of his crown inflates the already gigantic ego of the wearer.

2342
01:55:09,529 --> 01:55:10,489
Gamer certificate.

2343
01:55:10,489 --> 01:55:11,609
Grants permission to Jex.

2344
01:55:12,329 --> 01:55:15,369
Informs common casuals of the wearer's elite gaming status.

2345
01:55:16,010 --> 01:55:16,970
A spie knife.

2346
01:55:16,970 --> 01:55:17,529
A comb.

2347
01:55:17,529 --> 01:55:18,250
And a light gun.

2348
01:55:18,890 --> 01:55:20,729
Exactly two and a half bald coin.

2349
01:55:21,670 --> 01:55:22,789
Five common rats.

2350
01:55:23,510 --> 01:55:27,109
One giant rat who makes all the rules and one uncommon good rat.

2351
01:55:27,109 --> 01:55:28,149
It's not Otto.

2352
01:55:29,029 --> 01:55:30,069
What is it, Otto?

2353
01:55:30,710 --> 01:55:34,979
Abilities.

2354
01:55:35,699 --> 01:55:37,220
You're doing a great job.

2355
01:55:38,810 --> 01:55:39,609
Summon, hold on.

2356
01:55:42,680 --> 01:55:45,960
Summon an ethereal being that begins to chant encouraging words.

2357
01:55:45,960 --> 01:55:48,680
Plus one to pride and plus one to gaming ability.

2358
01:55:49,399 --> 01:55:51,000
The master of comedy.

2359
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:54,460
When character makes an intelligent and funny joke plus two to all stats.

2360
01:55:54,460 --> 01:55:55,579
That's pretty good.

2361
01:55:55,579 --> 01:55:59,819
But yeah, when character makes a bad joke, minus two to all stats.

2362
01:56:04,260 --> 01:56:04,819
Free shit.

2363
01:56:04,819 --> 01:56:07,779
Once a day, character can summon a random item into the inventory.

2364
01:56:07,779 --> 01:56:10,100
This item always is worthless and has no use.

2365
01:56:11,460 --> 01:56:12,819
And then my ultimate ability.

2366
01:56:13,619 --> 01:56:14,659
Summon Bugleberry.

2367
01:56:15,300 --> 01:56:16,659
Summons Bugleberry.

2368
01:56:16,659 --> 01:56:20,260
Both friendly and enemy characters nearby get bored and leave.

2369
01:56:20,979 --> 01:56:22,180
Oh shit.

2370
01:56:24,250 --> 01:56:34,569
Well, this is awesome.

2371
01:56:34,569 --> 01:56:35,210
Good shit.

2372
01:56:38,390 --> 01:56:39,829
Plus two to all stats.

2373
01:56:42,180 --> 01:56:43,300
Oh, that would be so bad.

2374
01:56:43,300 --> 01:56:46,579
You know, if you guys think about how passive buffs and debuffs would just hurt.

2375
01:56:47,140 --> 01:56:48,260
And life would just suck.

2376
01:56:49,350 --> 01:56:54,869
Can you imagine if you just all of a sudden you did some random act or some random reason.

2377
01:56:54,869 --> 01:56:57,029
You had a ring in your inventory that increased like your,

2378
01:56:57,590 --> 01:56:59,989
like increased your intelligence by plus five randomly.

2379
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,319
Or it could take, you know, minus five or something.

2380
01:57:03,319 --> 01:57:04,199
That would be horrible.

2381
01:57:05,079 --> 01:57:06,869
You'd be walking around.

2382
01:57:06,869 --> 01:57:09,989
You'd be like driving your car and you'd get hit by the debuff.

2383
01:57:09,989 --> 01:57:12,550
And you just wouldn't be able to drive your fucking car anymore.

2384
01:57:12,550 --> 01:57:13,270
You'd have to.

2385
01:57:13,270 --> 01:57:14,630
I don't know how to do this.

2386
01:57:14,630 --> 01:57:21,189
It'd be terrible.

2387
01:57:21,189 --> 01:57:22,630
Zoom in on the chest.

2388
01:57:22,630 --> 01:57:26,890
The gamer license.

2389
01:57:29,500 --> 01:57:34,329
Comb as a gamer necklace.

2390
01:57:37,979 --> 01:57:38,699
Good shit.

2391
01:57:38,699 --> 01:57:39,020
Awesome.

2392
01:57:42,649 --> 01:57:44,090
And that's it for the art.

2393
01:57:44,090 --> 01:57:47,770
Up until the beginning of March, I'm going to move on to videos now.

2394
01:57:49,399 --> 01:57:50,199
Video files.

2395
01:57:50,760 --> 01:57:56,579
But before we do that, I'm going to go take a pee and refill my hamster drink.

2396
01:57:57,300 --> 01:57:58,220
Be right back.

2397
02:01:37,720 --> 02:01:39,000
Anthony Wendell.

2398
02:01:40,789 --> 02:01:42,779
Jazz musician.

2399
02:01:42,779 --> 02:01:44,630
Only 22 years old.

2400
02:01:44,630 --> 02:01:45,590
You could believe it.

2401
02:01:45,590 --> 02:01:48,470
The album's available today.

2402
02:01:49,029 --> 02:01:51,479
As we come back here.

2403
02:01:51,479 --> 02:01:52,920
Let's talk.

2404
02:01:55,960 --> 02:02:00,140
So today we're going to move to the video section.

2405
02:02:01,590 --> 02:02:03,609
Right now.

2406
02:02:03,609 --> 02:02:04,329
Radio joke.

2407
02:02:04,329 --> 02:02:05,689
Oh my god, we're radio joke.

2408
02:02:05,689 --> 02:02:07,210
Oh my god, we're radio joke.

2409
02:02:08,090 --> 02:02:08,569
No.

2410
02:02:08,569 --> 02:02:09,130
All right, let's go.

2411
02:02:13,289 --> 02:02:14,729
We are going to move to the videos.

2412
02:02:14,729 --> 02:02:16,329
The first one is called Darth Jerma.

2413
02:02:16,329 --> 02:02:17,210
I already know what this one is.

2414
02:02:17,210 --> 02:02:18,090
I don't even have to watch it.

2415
02:02:18,810 --> 02:02:19,529
But here we go.

2416
02:02:20,090 --> 02:02:26,539
I already know what this is.

2417
02:02:26,539 --> 02:02:27,579
I already know what this is.

2418
02:02:27,579 --> 02:02:43,159
Oh, by the way, if you've never seen Star Wars, this is a Star Wars spoiler, I guess.

2419
02:02:43,800 --> 02:02:45,239
This is the part of the movie Star Wars.

2420
02:02:46,039 --> 02:02:48,039
And you know who Darth Vader is, right?

2421
02:02:48,039 --> 02:02:48,600
You know that.

2422
02:02:48,600 --> 02:02:50,840
But like, you might not know anything else.

2423
02:02:50,840 --> 02:02:53,560
This is a potential spoiler for the movie Star Wars.

2424
02:02:53,560 --> 02:02:54,359
Okay.

2425
02:02:54,359 --> 02:02:58,149
By the way, I have to say this every time we do this.

2426
02:02:58,149 --> 02:03:01,430
If you've ever watched a TV show in your life, just be careful.

2427
02:03:01,430 --> 02:03:03,189
Because this like, I'm going to try.

2428
02:03:03,750 --> 02:03:06,229
But this, no, no, I'm being serious.

2429
02:03:06,710 --> 02:03:10,390
I got like a direct message like a year ago that was like, dude, you really have like

2430
02:03:10,390 --> 02:03:11,350
spoiled a movie for me.

2431
02:03:11,350 --> 02:03:12,630
And I'm just like, all right, I got to be careful now.

2432
02:03:12,630 --> 02:03:13,670
One guy had power.

2433
02:03:13,670 --> 02:03:41,079
Oh, got it.

2434
02:03:43,960 --> 02:03:45,720
We all knew what this was.

2435
02:03:45,720 --> 02:03:48,840
I don't know who, everybody knows what that was.

2436
02:03:48,840 --> 02:03:51,479
I didn't have to pretend like, there's no way.

2437
02:03:51,479 --> 02:03:54,279
You know what would be funny if that's what, if that was not what it was.

2438
02:03:56,659 --> 02:03:57,539
Got it.

2439
02:03:57,539 --> 02:03:59,590
Bro, that was a spoiler.

2440
02:04:00,229 --> 02:04:05,850
Okay, coming up next.

2441
02:04:06,409 --> 02:04:11,960
This is called the Elf Jerma Picnic.

2442
02:04:21,210 --> 02:04:23,210
Coffee, Cheetos, chicken.

2443
02:04:24,170 --> 02:04:24,670
Yeah.

2444
02:04:26,409 --> 02:04:26,909
Yes.

2445
02:04:27,609 --> 02:04:28,109
Hey.

2446
02:04:29,260 --> 02:04:29,760
You.

2447
02:04:30,739 --> 02:04:31,300
What?

2448
02:04:31,300 --> 02:04:38,100
It's time for you to come look at me.

2449
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:38,600
Shut up.

2450
02:04:41,109 --> 02:04:42,310
I'll be going this way now.

2451
02:04:42,949 --> 02:04:46,199
What a gamer.

2452
02:04:46,199 --> 02:04:50,340
You know, my mother always told me, be a good boy.

2453
02:04:52,170 --> 02:04:52,670
Yeah.

2454
02:04:54,649 --> 02:05:01,260
Taking you guys on the scenic route.

2455
02:05:06,149 --> 02:05:07,430
What were you expecting?

2456
02:05:07,430 --> 02:05:08,550
Super frog.

2457
02:05:08,630 --> 02:05:09,270
Oh, I was.

2458
02:05:09,270 --> 02:05:10,229
How could you not like it?

2459
02:05:10,229 --> 02:05:11,029
It's got candy.

2460
02:05:13,500 --> 02:05:14,140
Small.

2461
02:05:14,140 --> 02:05:15,100
Get a big spider.

2462
02:05:15,100 --> 02:05:15,739
Hello.

2463
02:05:15,739 --> 02:05:19,220
I've heard some nice things about you.

2464
02:05:19,220 --> 02:05:20,899
I have nothing to do with this.

2465
02:05:21,699 --> 02:05:23,500
I was just trying to go to the bathroom.

2466
02:05:29,670 --> 02:05:31,460
Fuck you.

2467
02:05:31,460 --> 02:05:33,399
I'm the man.

2468
02:05:33,399 --> 02:05:33,899
Hey, mom.

2469
02:05:34,439 --> 02:05:35,159
Mom, I see it.

2470
02:05:37,060 --> 02:05:37,560
Yeah.

2471
02:05:37,560 --> 02:05:38,060
Wow.

2472
02:05:46,869 --> 02:05:47,369
Look.

2473
02:05:48,060 --> 02:05:48,779
That's fucked up.

2474
02:05:49,579 --> 02:05:50,140
Look.

2475
02:05:50,140 --> 02:05:51,340
Why is it a fucking Egypt?

2476
02:05:51,340 --> 02:05:52,380
What? No, no, no.

2477
02:05:52,380 --> 02:05:55,420
No, it's Egypt and we're both flog pyros.

2478
02:05:55,420 --> 02:05:55,920
No.

2479
02:05:56,319 --> 02:06:02,060
I think this one's on here.

2480
02:06:02,060 --> 02:06:03,899
This one's on here, I think.

2481
02:06:03,899 --> 02:06:06,640
All right.

2482
02:06:06,640 --> 02:06:08,000
Well, that was that one.

2483
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:09,479
German picnic.

2484
02:06:09,479 --> 02:06:10,680
The best part was you.

2485
02:06:11,239 --> 02:06:13,079
It's time for you to look at me.

2486
02:06:14,199 --> 02:06:15,479
Very good use.

2487
02:06:15,479 --> 02:06:16,199
Very good use.

2488
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,420
Give this one a link.

2489
02:06:19,420 --> 02:06:19,819
This one.

2490
02:06:19,819 --> 02:06:20,619
Okay, here.

2491
02:06:20,619 --> 02:06:22,989
Don't give any spoilers.

2492
02:06:23,550 --> 02:06:26,220
Here's the link to that one.

2493
02:06:26,779 --> 02:06:29,180
Hang on.

2494
02:06:30,750 --> 02:06:34,090
This one's called German gets down.

2495
02:06:35,369 --> 02:06:37,420
It's down.

2496
02:06:38,779 --> 02:06:40,890
This could be a dancing number.

2497
02:06:55,899 --> 02:07:10,409
I don't know what it is.

2498
02:07:12,890 --> 02:07:22,359
I can't believe I did all of these.

2499
02:07:22,359 --> 02:07:25,199
I really can't believe I did all of these.

2500
02:07:25,760 --> 02:07:31,390
This really was like your grandfather when you're like,

2501
02:07:31,390 --> 02:07:32,909
hey, grandpa, do this move.

2502
02:07:32,909 --> 02:07:34,750
And he's like, okay, I don't know what that is.

2503
02:07:34,750 --> 02:07:36,270
But are you sure, son?

2504
02:07:36,829 --> 02:07:44,479
Disable auto play.

2505
02:07:44,479 --> 02:07:45,039
I forgot.

2506
02:07:45,600 --> 02:07:47,439
I did on the last like six.

2507
02:07:47,439 --> 02:07:49,840
But I didn't on the these ones because I forgot.

2508
02:07:49,840 --> 02:07:52,000
And this like it's like 60 videos.

2509
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:52,800
So I forgot.

2510
02:07:52,800 --> 02:07:54,000
That's too bad for me.

2511
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:55,039
And for you apparently too,

2512
02:07:55,039 --> 02:07:56,000
because you have to deal with the two.

2513
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:56,640
I'm sorry about that.

2514
02:07:56,640 --> 02:07:57,279
But that's the way it is.

2515
02:07:57,279 --> 02:07:58,000
Let's keep going.

2516
02:07:58,000 --> 02:07:58,880
No spoilers here.

2517
02:07:59,439 --> 02:08:02,810
Oh, these.

2518
02:08:02,810 --> 02:08:04,890
Okay, these next couple are very, very interesting.

2519
02:08:05,609 --> 02:08:09,289
These next couple are animations of the rats,

2520
02:08:09,289 --> 02:08:10,250
as you'll see in a second.

2521
02:08:11,479 --> 02:08:12,199
That old intro.

2522
02:08:12,199 --> 02:08:13,159
Take a look at this.

2523
02:08:13,159 --> 02:08:14,920
Cute rat characters in a marching band.

2524
02:08:39,500 --> 02:08:46,140
Rats don't chat.

2525
02:08:46,140 --> 02:08:47,340
We pray at night.

2526
02:08:47,340 --> 02:08:48,460
We stomp at night.

2527
02:08:52,079 --> 02:08:53,920
Rats don't rest.

2528
02:08:54,800 --> 02:08:58,350
We stomp at night.

2529
02:08:58,350 --> 02:08:59,930
We pray at night.

2530
02:08:59,930 --> 02:09:00,970
We stomp at night.

2531
02:09:00,970 --> 02:09:02,170
We pray at night.

2532
02:09:02,170 --> 02:09:03,449
We stomp at night.

2533
02:09:03,449 --> 02:09:08,829
We're rats, rats, rats, rats, rats.

2534
02:09:08,829 --> 02:09:13,550
Oh, the giant rat that makes all of the rules.

2535
02:09:13,550 --> 02:09:16,109
Giant rat, giant rat.

2536
02:09:16,109 --> 02:09:21,279
I'm so glad you said thank you.

2537
02:09:21,279 --> 02:09:29,560
Thank you for this.

2538
02:09:30,840 --> 02:09:33,550
Oh, is this?

2539
02:09:33,550 --> 02:09:34,590
That's what this is.

2540
02:09:34,590 --> 02:09:34,909
Okay.

2541
02:09:36,109 --> 02:09:37,289
All right.

2542
02:09:37,289 --> 02:09:41,529
The next one is also auto plays off.

2543
02:09:41,529 --> 02:09:41,850
I know.

2544
02:09:42,729 --> 02:09:44,090
Same thing, but it was a different edition.

2545
02:09:44,729 --> 02:09:49,229
Spoilers.

2546
02:09:49,229 --> 02:09:49,630
All right.

2547
02:09:49,630 --> 02:09:49,949
Fine.

2548
02:09:49,949 --> 02:09:50,350
Spoiler.

2549
02:09:50,350 --> 02:09:50,670
I know.

2550
02:09:50,670 --> 02:09:50,909
Fine.

2551
02:09:51,869 --> 02:09:52,350
I told you.

2552
02:09:52,350 --> 02:09:52,670
I know.

2553
02:09:52,670 --> 02:09:53,149
Tabs.

2554
02:09:53,149 --> 02:09:53,550
I know.

2555
02:10:06,680 --> 02:10:27,319
Giant rat coming this one, too.

2556
02:10:28,119 --> 02:10:37,720
All right.

2557
02:10:37,720 --> 02:10:38,199
There he is.

2558
02:10:42,109 --> 02:10:42,989
Giant rat.

2559
02:10:46,829 --> 02:10:48,350
Again, again, do it again.

2560
02:10:49,229 --> 02:10:50,109
Rample them again.

2561
02:10:50,109 --> 02:10:50,670
Do it again.

2562
02:10:53,069 --> 02:10:57,920
It's time for you to kick to the sixth or beat.

2563
02:10:58,720 --> 02:11:01,199
This song makes it impossible to really get it right with anything.

2564
02:11:02,159 --> 02:11:02,720
Is that what it is?

2565
02:11:03,760 --> 02:11:04,000
Four?

2566
02:11:04,640 --> 02:11:05,640
I don't even know.

2567
02:11:07,039 --> 02:11:07,680
No spoilers.

2568
02:11:07,680 --> 02:11:08,399
Fine.

2569
02:11:08,399 --> 02:11:12,619
I'm up next is one.

2570
02:11:12,619 --> 02:11:16,539
This is called the green screen DLC waiting room.

2571
02:11:16,539 --> 02:11:22,750
Off to a great start on this one.

2572
02:11:26,119 --> 02:11:27,239
Here it comes.

2573
02:11:28,619 --> 02:11:30,060
We have first up.

2574
02:11:30,859 --> 02:11:31,739
Jerma.

2575
02:11:31,739 --> 02:11:32,300
That's me.

2576
02:11:32,300 --> 02:11:33,420
Jerma985.

2577
02:11:33,420 --> 02:11:34,300
Y'all know who I am.

2578
02:11:34,859 --> 02:11:36,060
Do I need an introduction?

2579
02:11:59,340 --> 02:12:00,779
Um, what the fuck?

2580
02:12:00,779 --> 02:12:03,439
Hey, if I lean back, can you spit in my mouth?

2581
02:12:03,760 --> 02:12:04,319
Piss on me.

2582
02:12:04,319 --> 02:12:04,800
Piss it.

2583
02:12:04,800 --> 02:12:05,760
Piss in my face.

2584
02:12:05,760 --> 02:12:06,159
Do it.

2585
02:12:06,159 --> 02:12:06,720
I'm fine.

2586
02:12:06,720 --> 02:12:07,760
I can hold my breath.

2587
02:12:07,760 --> 02:12:10,960
He's going to go sit down on the toilet and piss up into my face.

2588
02:12:11,949 --> 02:12:16,239
I think about, um, I think eating going on a diet.

2589
02:12:16,239 --> 02:12:16,880
It's not a bad idea.

2590
02:12:16,880 --> 02:12:18,560
My calculations are correct.

2591
02:12:18,560 --> 02:12:18,880
Hold on.

2592
02:12:18,880 --> 02:12:19,439
Wait, wait, hold on.

2593
02:12:19,439 --> 02:12:20,640
Be a virgin, right?

2594
02:12:21,520 --> 02:12:23,439
I meant Virgo.

2595
02:12:24,560 --> 02:12:25,119
Sorry.

2596
02:12:25,119 --> 02:12:27,039
I know Virgos are very sensitive.

2597
02:12:31,680 --> 02:12:32,640
Oh, my God.

2598
02:12:33,359 --> 02:12:33,840
You see that?

2599
02:12:33,840 --> 02:12:34,960
Look at these Pogchamps.

2600
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:42,479
All right.

2601
02:12:42,479 --> 02:12:42,960
All right.

2602
02:12:42,960 --> 02:12:43,279
Okay.

2603
02:12:45,680 --> 02:12:46,079
Easy.

2604
02:12:46,079 --> 02:12:47,760
Do I eat penis?

2605
02:12:47,760 --> 02:12:48,479
Of course I do.

2606
02:12:50,960 --> 02:12:51,600
Okay.

2607
02:12:51,600 --> 02:12:52,239
All right.

2608
02:12:52,239 --> 02:12:52,880
Okay.

2609
02:12:52,880 --> 02:12:53,760
Okay.

2610
02:12:53,760 --> 02:12:54,159
Okay.

2611
02:12:54,720 --> 02:12:55,199
Okay.

2612
02:12:55,840 --> 02:12:56,239
Okay.

2613
02:12:57,119 --> 02:12:57,439
Good.

2614
02:12:58,079 --> 02:12:59,920
Very good.

2615
02:12:59,920 --> 02:13:00,720
Good.

2616
02:13:00,720 --> 02:13:01,119
Great.

2617
02:13:01,680 --> 02:13:02,399
Yes.

2618
02:13:02,399 --> 02:13:03,359
Oh, okay.

2619
02:13:03,359 --> 02:13:04,640
I'm happy.

2620
02:13:04,640 --> 02:13:05,760
We're happy.

2621
02:13:05,760 --> 02:13:06,640
We're happy.

2622
02:13:06,640 --> 02:13:07,359
Okay.

2623
02:13:07,359 --> 02:13:08,399
We're very happy.

2624
02:13:08,399 --> 02:13:08,800
We're...

2625
02:13:08,800 --> 02:13:09,760
All right.

2626
02:13:09,760 --> 02:13:10,079
Okay.

2627
02:13:13,310 --> 02:13:14,750
Oh, God damn it.

2628
02:13:15,789 --> 02:13:19,579
Turn it up.

2629
02:13:19,579 --> 02:13:21,229
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2630
02:13:21,229 --> 02:13:21,789
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2631
02:13:21,789 --> 02:13:23,100
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2632
02:13:23,100 --> 02:13:23,739
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2633
02:13:23,739 --> 02:13:24,060
Oh, yeah.

2634
02:13:24,060 --> 02:13:26,430
What the fuck, man?

2635
02:13:50,939 --> 02:13:51,100
Okay.

2636
02:13:51,100 --> 02:13:51,899
We're done with this one.

2637
02:13:51,899 --> 02:13:52,619
That one was fun.

2638
02:13:52,619 --> 02:13:52,939
Thank you.

2639
02:13:53,579 --> 02:13:54,140
Thank you.

2640
02:13:54,140 --> 02:13:54,699
Okay.

2641
02:13:54,699 --> 02:13:55,180
Yeah.

2642
02:13:55,180 --> 02:13:55,739
Good.

2643
02:13:55,739 --> 02:13:56,619
What else is on here?

2644
02:13:56,619 --> 02:13:56,939
Okay.

2645
02:13:56,939 --> 02:13:57,659
Sure.

2646
02:13:57,739 --> 02:13:59,739
That's fucking fine.

2647
02:14:00,539 --> 02:14:01,039
Okay.

2648
02:14:02,380 --> 02:14:02,880
Okay.

2649
02:14:04,239 --> 02:14:05,119
What the fuck?

2650
02:14:05,680 --> 02:14:07,039
No, it's not an emote.

2651
02:14:07,039 --> 02:14:07,840
Still, you're right.

2652
02:14:10,909 --> 02:14:11,710
Yes, it's not.

2653
02:14:16,199 --> 02:14:17,079
Jesus.

2654
02:14:17,079 --> 02:14:18,840
Fucking crack night.

2655
02:14:18,840 --> 02:14:20,670
You want a link to this one?

2656
02:14:20,670 --> 02:14:21,310
Okay.

2657
02:14:21,310 --> 02:14:21,789
Fine.

2658
02:14:21,789 --> 02:14:22,029
Sure.

2659
02:14:23,149 --> 02:14:23,630
There you go.

2660
02:14:24,270 --> 02:14:25,149
That was a video.

2661
02:14:27,100 --> 02:14:28,060
My God.

2662
02:14:33,130 --> 02:14:33,609
Okay.

2663
02:14:33,609 --> 02:14:34,409
This one's called,

2664
02:14:34,409 --> 02:14:36,010
is Jerma real?

2665
02:14:36,010 --> 02:14:37,449
Well, we'll find out soon enough.

2666
02:14:38,409 --> 02:14:42,880
So, those of you that said this was not real.

2667
02:14:43,520 --> 02:14:44,899
It is.

2668
02:14:45,520 --> 02:14:47,609
It's very real.

2669
02:14:51,760 --> 02:14:52,159
Okay.

2670
02:14:52,159 --> 02:14:54,000
Now, wrap it up, Jeremias.

2671
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:55,520
We had enough of our shit today.

2672
02:14:55,520 --> 02:14:57,760
Not only you tried to sell us a wallet,

2673
02:14:57,760 --> 02:15:00,239
but also played Firewatch for three days.

2674
02:15:00,239 --> 02:15:03,119
SDR8 now play Poi Poi on the PS1.

2675
02:15:03,119 --> 02:15:06,640
Oh, is that just a game request?

2676
02:15:06,640 --> 02:15:11,470
Hold on.

2677
02:15:11,470 --> 02:15:13,310
Did I get baited into watching a video?

2678
02:15:13,310 --> 02:15:14,590
But it's a game request.

2679
02:15:15,310 --> 02:15:23,520
Thanks.

2680
02:15:24,960 --> 02:15:25,520
Okay.

2681
02:15:25,520 --> 02:15:26,079
Maybe I'll...

2682
02:15:26,079 --> 02:15:27,119
I don't even know what that game was.

2683
02:15:27,119 --> 02:15:28,000
I forgot it already.

2684
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:28,720
And I'm not going back.

2685
02:15:29,439 --> 02:15:32,699
This one's called Jerma Slappy.

2686
02:15:32,699 --> 02:15:34,060
I feel like I'm going to like this one.

2687
02:15:37,050 --> 02:15:37,850
Oh, you want to fight?

2688
02:15:37,850 --> 02:15:38,649
You want to fight?

2689
02:15:38,649 --> 02:15:39,529
Don't fuck with that.

2690
02:15:39,529 --> 02:15:40,010
I'm going in.

2691
02:15:48,409 --> 02:15:50,590
You want to fight?

2692
02:15:50,590 --> 02:15:51,390
You want to fight?

2693
02:15:51,390 --> 02:15:52,270
Don't fuck with that.

2694
02:15:52,270 --> 02:15:52,670
I'm going in.

2695
02:16:00,640 --> 02:16:01,119
That's good.

2696
02:16:04,569 --> 02:16:05,529
Riff the Pet.

2697
02:16:06,329 --> 02:16:06,970
Yeah.

2698
02:16:06,970 --> 02:16:08,729
I don't even know...

2699
02:16:08,729 --> 02:16:10,960
I'm not going to click Jerma Lick.

2700
02:16:10,960 --> 02:16:12,399
Yeah, I have no idea what that's going to do.

2701
02:16:13,199 --> 02:16:14,880
You don't click random YouTube videos.

2702
02:16:14,880 --> 02:16:15,680
You don't know what they are.

2703
02:16:19,319 --> 02:16:19,720
You have to...

2704
02:16:19,720 --> 02:16:20,359
No, I don't.

2705
02:16:20,359 --> 02:16:21,479
I don't know what it is.

2706
02:16:21,479 --> 02:16:22,520
No, I'm not going to click it.

2707
02:16:25,420 --> 02:16:26,060
High Risk.

2708
02:16:27,260 --> 02:16:28,539
High Risk, High Reward?

2709
02:16:29,819 --> 02:16:31,739
Explain to me what the reward is.

2710
02:16:31,739 --> 02:16:32,780
High Risk is...

2711
02:16:33,819 --> 02:16:35,819
Oh, yeah, that could be TOS.

2712
02:16:35,819 --> 02:16:36,700
Reward.

2713
02:16:36,700 --> 02:16:39,579
I get banned for three days

2714
02:16:39,579 --> 02:16:41,020
and have a strike on my account.

2715
02:16:41,020 --> 02:16:41,819
What's the reward?

2716
02:16:42,379 --> 02:16:43,100
It could be funny.

2717
02:16:43,819 --> 02:16:44,700
All right, let's go.

2718
02:16:44,700 --> 02:16:45,899
You want to hear a real vain.

2719
02:16:46,459 --> 02:16:53,149
I think we've seen this.

2720
02:16:54,110 --> 02:17:02,639
Have you never seen...

2721
02:17:02,719 --> 02:17:04,559
Have you ever seen Batman?

2722
02:17:07,600 --> 02:17:08,559
Fucking whatever.

2723
02:17:13,760 --> 02:17:15,680
You make darkness, is all I like.

2724
02:17:16,319 --> 02:17:17,840
But I was born it.

2725
02:17:19,280 --> 02:17:21,040
I drank up the darkness.

2726
02:17:22,190 --> 02:17:23,950
And you were just a baby.

2727
02:17:23,950 --> 02:17:24,989
What's that line?

2728
02:17:24,989 --> 02:17:25,790
I gotta look up the line.

2729
02:17:25,790 --> 02:17:26,190
Hold on.

2730
02:17:27,819 --> 02:17:28,780
Good Bane quote.

2731
02:17:28,780 --> 02:17:29,100
Hold on.

2732
02:17:29,100 --> 02:17:29,979
Good Bane...

2733
02:17:29,979 --> 02:17:30,940
Best Bane quote.

2734
02:17:39,600 --> 02:17:41,440
You make darkness, is all I like.

2735
02:17:42,079 --> 02:17:43,600
But I was born it.

2736
02:17:45,020 --> 02:17:46,860
I drank up the darkness.

2737
02:17:47,950 --> 02:17:49,709
And you were just a baby.

2738
02:17:49,709 --> 02:17:50,750
What's that line?

2739
02:17:50,750 --> 02:17:51,549
I gotta look up the line.

2740
02:17:51,549 --> 02:17:51,950
Hold on.

2741
02:17:53,549 --> 02:17:54,590
Good Bane quote.

2742
02:17:54,590 --> 02:17:54,829
Hold on.

2743
02:17:54,829 --> 02:17:55,709
Good Bane...

2744
02:17:55,709 --> 02:17:56,750
Best Bane quote.

2745
02:17:59,629 --> 02:18:01,229
That's like my favorite video now.

2746
02:18:06,360 --> 02:18:10,459
Derma Lick.

2747
02:18:10,459 --> 02:18:10,700
No!

2748
02:18:11,340 --> 02:18:15,229
What's that line?

2749
02:18:15,229 --> 02:18:15,950
Oh my god.

2750
02:18:15,950 --> 02:18:17,629
This is called Derma Mouse Has a...

2751
02:18:18,190 --> 02:18:20,430
Derma95 Mouse Has a Bad Hiccup.

2752
02:18:21,229 --> 02:18:22,350
I'm gonna blind you in a second.

2753
02:18:27,659 --> 02:18:28,159
Hi.

2754
02:18:28,540 --> 02:18:33,149
Hello.

2755
02:18:33,149 --> 02:18:33,649
You okay?

2756
02:18:37,399 --> 02:18:37,899
Yeah.

2757
02:18:38,360 --> 02:18:41,290
Are you sure?

2758
02:18:42,969 --> 02:18:47,440
Well, I have just never talked to a detective before.

2759
02:18:48,719 --> 02:18:50,719
I've heard so many nice things about you.

2760
02:18:51,440 --> 02:18:55,399
I don't want to be embarrassing.

2761
02:19:04,799 --> 02:19:05,920
That was cute.

2762
02:19:05,920 --> 02:19:06,879
What a cute one.

2763
02:19:08,079 --> 02:19:18,729
That was adorable.

2764
02:19:19,850 --> 02:19:23,799
This next one's called Derma Has Fallen into a River in Lego City.

2765
02:19:24,920 --> 02:19:29,629
A man has fallen...

2766
02:19:29,629 --> 02:19:30,829
Hold on. That hurt my head.

2767
02:19:31,549 --> 02:19:32,729
God damn it.

2768
02:19:32,729 --> 02:19:33,450
That fucking hurt.

2769
02:19:33,450 --> 02:19:34,569
That was so loud.

2770
02:19:35,610 --> 02:19:38,250
A man has fallen into the river in Lego City.

2771
02:19:38,250 --> 02:19:40,010
Start the new rescue helicopter.

2772
02:19:41,370 --> 02:19:41,870
Hey!

2773
02:19:50,219 --> 02:19:51,260
I better ban that guy.

2774
02:19:51,260 --> 02:19:54,459
Ban him. I don't want to see him ever fucking again in my chat.

2775
02:19:54,459 --> 02:19:55,100
Ever again!

2776
02:20:02,190 --> 02:20:05,440
Now at least I know where that thing is from now.

2777
02:20:05,520 --> 02:20:08,639
It's the first time I've ever seen the Lego City a man has fallen into the river.

2778
02:20:10,250 --> 02:20:10,569
I had...

2779
02:20:10,569 --> 02:20:12,889
You guys would write that shit all the time and I didn't even know what it was.

2780
02:20:17,500 --> 02:20:19,100
Please play Derma Lick.

2781
02:20:19,100 --> 02:20:21,500
All right. I'm gonna look up Derma Lick.

2782
02:20:21,500 --> 02:20:22,940
And I'm gonna see if it's appropriate for me.

2783
02:20:23,500 --> 02:20:24,299
Derma Lick.

2784
02:20:24,299 --> 02:20:25,020
Okay. Let's find out.

2785
02:20:25,020 --> 02:20:25,659
I'm muting this.

2786
02:20:37,229 --> 02:20:38,590
It's just kind of me going like...

2787
02:20:38,590 --> 02:20:39,149
All right. Fine.

2788
02:20:39,149 --> 02:20:39,649
It's...

2789
02:20:40,190 --> 02:20:40,590
Go it.

2790
02:20:40,590 --> 02:20:41,229
All right. It's fine.

2791
02:20:41,790 --> 02:20:42,430
Just me going like...

2792
02:20:43,870 --> 02:20:49,260
We watched it. Good.

2793
02:20:51,610 --> 02:21:00,090
All right. Come on up.

2794
02:21:00,090 --> 02:21:02,649
It's keep your hands off my stream.

2795
02:21:03,610 --> 02:21:06,569
This looks to be animated.

2796
02:21:20,510 --> 02:21:20,989
Go, Joe!

2797
02:21:22,030 --> 02:21:22,510
No, it's not.

2798
02:21:23,469 --> 02:21:24,030
This is good.

2799
02:21:25,389 --> 02:21:26,270
This is really good.

2800
02:21:33,930 --> 02:21:35,049
That's Joel and Vinnie?

2801
02:21:35,049 --> 02:21:37,479
That was really, really well done.

2802
02:21:37,479 --> 02:21:39,479
That was very well made.

2803
02:21:39,479 --> 02:21:41,479
That was awesome.

2804
02:21:41,479 --> 02:21:43,479
Here's a link to that one.

2805
02:21:43,479 --> 02:21:45,479
By the way, I noticed something about that video.

2806
02:21:45,479 --> 02:21:47,479
I'm sorry.

2807
02:21:47,479 --> 02:21:49,479
I'm sorry.

2808
02:21:49,479 --> 02:21:51,479
I'm sorry.

2809
02:21:51,479 --> 02:21:54,680
I'm sorry.

2810
02:21:54,680 --> 02:21:56,680
I'm sorry.

2811
02:21:56,680 --> 02:21:58,680
I'm sorry.

2812
02:21:58,680 --> 02:22:00,680
I'm sorry.

2813
02:22:00,680 --> 02:22:08,430
I'm sorry.

2814
02:22:08,430 --> 02:22:14,569
I'm sorry.

2815
02:22:14,569 --> 02:22:19,760
By the way, I noticed something about that video.

2816
02:22:19,760 --> 02:22:21,760
I'm like six inches tall than Joel is.

2817
02:22:21,760 --> 02:22:23,760
Pretty sick.

2818
02:22:23,760 --> 02:22:25,760
Pretty good, actually. That's pretty nice.

2819
02:22:25,760 --> 02:22:29,280
This one's called Jerma Wolf.

2820
02:22:29,280 --> 02:22:31,770
With this ruby, I replace your soul.

2821
02:22:31,770 --> 02:22:33,770
With this ruby, I replace your soul.

2822
02:22:33,770 --> 02:22:35,770
You will obey.

2823
02:22:35,770 --> 02:22:37,770
You will obey.

2824
02:22:37,770 --> 02:22:48,010
This ruby, I replace your soul.

2825
02:22:48,010 --> 02:22:50,010
This ruby, I replace your soul.

2826
02:22:50,010 --> 02:22:52,010
You will obey.

2827
02:22:52,010 --> 02:22:54,010
You will obey.

2828
02:22:54,010 --> 02:22:58,879
You hear the breathing, right?

2829
02:22:58,879 --> 02:23:00,879
You hear the breathing, right?

2830
02:23:00,879 --> 02:23:02,879
After that, that's like a, no, fuck.

2831
02:23:02,879 --> 02:23:13,479
After that, listen.

2832
02:23:13,479 --> 02:23:16,809
You can hear the exhausted, like, no.

2833
02:23:16,809 --> 02:23:20,329
That's good.

2834
02:23:20,329 --> 02:23:31,399
Coming up next, we have Jerma Has Lunch.

2835
02:24:12,620 --> 02:24:15,760
That was awesome.

2836
02:24:15,760 --> 02:24:17,760
That was just a true testament

2837
02:24:17,760 --> 02:24:19,760
that you can make anything.

2838
02:24:19,760 --> 02:24:21,760
You can.

2839
02:24:21,760 --> 02:24:23,760
As long as you've got creative juices flowing.

2840
02:24:23,760 --> 02:24:25,760
Look at this.

2841
02:24:25,760 --> 02:24:30,879
With the Discord edits.

2842
02:24:30,879 --> 02:24:34,719
That was great. Absolutely great.

2843
02:24:34,719 --> 02:24:40,219
This is Jerma Without Context.

2844
02:24:40,219 --> 02:24:42,219
The urinal rant.

2845
02:24:42,219 --> 02:24:44,219
I love Jerma Without Context stuff because

2846
02:24:44,219 --> 02:24:46,219
of course it's going to sound probably weird.

2847
02:24:46,219 --> 02:24:48,219
What do I say? That I like shit?

2848
02:24:48,219 --> 02:24:50,219
I like shit in the toilet and then piss on the shit

2849
02:24:50,219 --> 02:24:52,219
and then shit in the toilet again and then shitter.

2850
02:24:52,219 --> 02:24:54,219
How many times do I say shit, shit, right? I shit on the toilet.

2851
02:24:54,219 --> 02:24:56,219
Oh, that's, oh, that's disgusting.

2852
02:24:56,219 --> 02:24:58,219
Not if you piss right onto the drain.

2853
02:24:58,219 --> 02:25:00,219
Right?

2854
02:25:00,219 --> 02:25:02,219
Like, if you piss directly

2855
02:25:02,219 --> 02:25:04,219
onto the, right in the metal pocket.

2856
02:25:04,219 --> 02:25:07,799
What?

2857
02:25:07,799 --> 02:25:16,700
You could just stand in it.

2858
02:25:16,700 --> 02:25:19,450
Are they made like that?

2859
02:25:19,450 --> 02:25:21,629
Unless you stand through.

2860
02:25:21,629 --> 02:25:25,340
It'll splash back.

2861
02:25:25,340 --> 02:25:27,899
Here's the door.

2862
02:25:27,899 --> 02:25:29,899
P hits here.

2863
02:25:29,899 --> 02:25:31,899
Butter hits here.

2864
02:25:31,899 --> 02:25:33,899
And what does it do?

2865
02:25:33,899 --> 02:25:36,139
Flashes over you

2866
02:25:36,139 --> 02:25:38,139
and your shoes and

2867
02:25:38,139 --> 02:26:07,500
What are you doing?

2868
02:26:07,500 --> 02:26:09,500
No, that's not what I'm talking about.

2869
02:26:09,500 --> 02:26:11,500
That's like, I wouldn't put my penis into that.

2870
02:26:11,500 --> 02:26:25,069
I wouldn't put my penis

2871
02:26:25,069 --> 02:26:27,069
in like that Venus flytrap

2872
02:26:27,069 --> 02:26:29,629
looking thing.

2873
02:26:29,629 --> 02:26:45,229
What?

2874
02:26:45,229 --> 02:26:49,260
Oh, it's all over the place.

2875
02:26:49,260 --> 02:26:54,760
I wouldn't.

2876
02:26:54,760 --> 02:26:56,760
I wouldn't do that.

2877
02:26:56,760 --> 02:26:58,760
That was pretty good though.

2878
02:26:58,760 --> 02:27:02,540
Nice work. Excellent work.

2879
02:27:02,540 --> 02:27:05,610
Joel checks the bathroom.

2880
02:27:05,610 --> 02:27:13,159
You guys hearing something?

2881
02:27:13,159 --> 02:27:15,159
Shake the bathroom?

2882
02:27:15,159 --> 02:27:19,899
You guys

2883
02:27:19,899 --> 02:27:21,899
hearing something? Shake the bathroom?

2884
02:27:21,899 --> 02:27:29,950
That's pretty

2885
02:27:29,950 --> 02:27:31,950
quality.

2886
02:27:31,950 --> 02:27:36,110
What is

2887
02:27:36,110 --> 02:27:38,110
this bath video?

2888
02:27:38,110 --> 02:27:40,110
Only

2889
02:27:40,110 --> 02:27:42,110
true fans know, Danny.

2890
02:27:42,110 --> 02:27:50,860
You'll find it someday. Oh, here

2891
02:27:50,860 --> 02:27:52,860
it is. Here's the job interview one that

2892
02:27:52,860 --> 02:27:54,860
was almost auto-played.

2893
02:27:54,860 --> 02:27:57,100
Just imagine

2894
02:27:57,100 --> 02:27:59,100
I drank like fucking a pint of vodka.

2895
02:27:59,100 --> 02:28:04,649
I gotta

2896
02:28:04,649 --> 02:28:06,649
keep it like that though. That's so fucking

2897
02:28:06,649 --> 02:28:08,649
funny.

2898
02:28:08,649 --> 02:28:17,040
I see that they zipped up.

2899
02:28:17,040 --> 02:28:19,040
Wait, what happened?

2900
02:28:19,040 --> 02:28:21,209
Prepares for

2901
02:28:21,209 --> 02:28:23,209
a job

2902
02:28:23,209 --> 02:28:25,209
interview in a locked bathroom?

2903
02:28:25,209 --> 02:28:27,209
Just imagine I drank like fucking a pint of vodka.

2904
02:28:27,209 --> 02:28:29,209
Am I in a bathroom?

2905
02:28:29,209 --> 02:28:35,040
It's a mystery.

2906
02:28:35,040 --> 02:28:37,040
What the fuck?

2907
02:28:37,040 --> 02:28:39,040
I haven't, no, I haven't played Deus Ex.

2908
02:28:39,040 --> 02:28:42,750
I don't know what that is.

2909
02:28:42,750 --> 02:28:44,750
This next video could be titled

2910
02:28:44,750 --> 02:28:46,750

02:30:30,520 --> 02:30:32,520
Four years ago, three, I don't know, it was a long

02:30:52,760 --> 02:30:57,879
right into the toilet for real. It was

2946
02:30:57,879 --> 02:30:59,879

I can't believe that people are doing this and I can't believe there's an audience of people watching it

3278
03:15:05,020 --> 03:15:15,299
It's unbelievable to me. That's I can't even fucking believe it. Is that a video unlisted? No, it's not

Give it a little bit of time

3389
03:27:33,149 --> 03:27:35,149
Sam freelance police. Thanks for 250

3390
03:27:35,549 --> 03:27:41,399
Hey jeremy remember two months ago when I said I was torn between game design and music and university

3391
03:27:42,280 --> 03:27:43,239
do

3392
03:27:43,239 --> 03:27:47,559
Well, in the meantime, I applied for a semester abroad at a music university in australia and I got accepted

3393
03:27:48,040 --> 03:27:50,430
With a super pug today

3394
03:27:50,430 --> 03:27:55,149
I woke up to an email from them saying that international students had their applications withdrawn because of the corona virus

3395
03:27:56,090 --> 03:27:59,930
Thanks for being there and cheering us up with your streams during these fucked up times

3396
03:28:05,389 --> 03:28:07,389
Yeah, I i've heard

3397
03:28:08,270 --> 03:28:10,829
I have no idea what's gonna happen with school and stuff

3398
03:28:12,860 --> 03:28:17,500
Because a lot of places are still canceling school through the end of the year what happens to the students

3399
03:28:18,540 --> 03:28:24,540
Is everybody just kind of held back a year. Do you do it again? What do you do with that the group of students?

3400
03:28:25,100 --> 03:28:26,459
Do it online

3401
03:28:26,459 --> 03:28:29,290
Just do online classes

3402
03:28:29,290 --> 03:28:31,290
I yeah, I guess

3403
03:28:37,129 --> 03:28:39,129
All school is on zoom now

3404
03:28:39,690 --> 03:28:53,020
That's rough. You can't do online classes on everything. Yeah

3405
03:28:54,059 --> 03:28:56,860
I would imagine a lot of stuff that requires hands-on experience and

3406
03:28:57,739 --> 03:28:59,340
Lab work and

3407
03:28:59,340 --> 03:29:01,959
It's gonna be a really really strange time

3408
03:29:02,600 --> 03:29:13,149
But hopefully when this is all over with and done and we can go back to normal. Hopefully

3409
03:29:14,030 --> 03:29:15,950
or at least

3410
03:29:15,950 --> 03:29:17,950
However, we can get there. Hopefully

3411
03:29:18,590 --> 03:29:24,799
They reach back out and you can get that done and you can go travel and go do things and study abroad

3412
03:29:25,840 --> 03:29:31,709
Thanks for the 250. I'm glad you're making some decisions though

3413
03:29:35,420 --> 03:29:38,459
Windar thanks for the five dollars. Hey jermis super excited for tomorrow's stream

3414
03:29:38,459 --> 03:29:41,500
Is it gonna be a normal time like usual? Yeah around four o'clock pacific

3415
03:29:42,059 --> 03:29:49,870
I'm gonna buy a nice pizza pie to share with chat tomorrow pepperoni only good. I do not hear any complaints from chat

3416
03:29:49,870 --> 03:29:55,479
I'm treating you can have a slice too streamer, but I bet you like pineapples on yours

3417
03:29:55,959 --> 03:29:57,959
Anyway, thanks for all you do. I don't

3418
03:29:58,600 --> 03:30:06,639
I think pineapple is I love pineapple as a fruit. I don't like it on pizza. I'm sorry

3419
03:30:07,280 --> 03:30:09,680
That's fine. Yeah, you all you all know that opinion by now

3420
03:30:10,399 --> 03:30:19,479
Thanks a lot dark soul. Thanks for the 250. There's a link deleted band really cool to see you bringing back last year's style

3421
03:30:19,959 --> 03:30:22,520
Sure, what it was

3422
03:30:22,520 --> 03:30:29,770
Let's speaking of styles. How about a giant enemy spider epic version the giant enemy spider?

3423
03:30:30,489 --> 03:30:46,540
Like a boss fight in the castlevania game

3424
03:30:47,260 --> 03:30:59,129
It's a good game, too

3425
03:30:59,129 --> 03:31:02,409
Next is giant enemy stir

3426
03:31:14,829 --> 03:31:16,829
Oh

3427
03:31:27,069 --> 03:31:29,180
It's catchy

3428
03:31:29,180 --> 03:31:34,600
It's a good one. Thanks for those

3429
03:31:37,100 --> 03:31:39,319
enemy spiders

3430
03:31:39,319 --> 03:31:41,319
Don't get the vod muted

3431
03:31:41,319 --> 03:31:43,319
I don't think that I should have muted vod

3432
03:31:44,620 --> 03:31:49,340
Hey swiggity swanky. Thanks for the 250. I don't have much money, but how much for the clips links to be back?

3433
03:31:49,899 --> 03:32:03,340
They'll be back next week broke it you guys broke it links will be back next week with a slight change

3434
03:32:03,979 --> 03:32:05,659
Uh-oh, what's that mean?

3435
03:32:05,659 --> 03:32:11,709
Thanks the 250 though whole of one zombie. Thanks for 250. I've been having back issues

3436
03:32:11,709 --> 03:32:15,069
So I finally decided to augment myself in order to boomer brace

3437
03:32:15,790 --> 03:32:22,909
Hopefully now i'll soon have the posture of a closed door and double as a shelf boomers rise up if you still can

3438
03:32:27,280 --> 03:32:29,280
That's posture goals right there

3439
03:32:29,680 --> 03:32:35,690
the door

3440
03:32:36,329 --> 03:32:46,409
Thanks for the 250. Good luck. Hopefully you feel better soon garfield the monday killer. Thanks for the 250

3441
03:32:46,489 --> 03:32:51,129
Remember jeremy you silly dog. You're still gonna watch garf sonic rebuilt video. It got canned

3442
03:32:51,690 --> 03:32:56,590
Last community content night in favor of joel's movie. That's true. You promised you'd watch it this time

3443
03:32:56,989 --> 03:32:58,989
Well, that's probably super late for you

3444
03:32:59,229 --> 03:33:03,819
Movies like an hour long you all know how much garf likes his naps in the cat box

3445
03:33:04,299 --> 03:33:09,290
If it's gotta wait till next time it's still gotta wait and take out a lasagna out of the oven before it's cooked

3446
03:33:09,770 --> 03:33:13,020
But if you do watch make sure to see the credits in the climax

3447
03:33:13,879 --> 03:33:17,149
Yeah, I did say I was gonna skip through it

3448
03:33:17,149 --> 03:33:18,909
Watch it tomorrow

3449
03:33:18,909 --> 03:33:23,790
I'll watch it tomorrow. I'll watch it tomorrow. I'll watch it. I know but here's the thing right

3450
03:33:24,590 --> 03:33:31,799
When all right the community content night maximum video watching is supposed to be five minutes

3451
03:33:32,440 --> 03:33:35,200
And you tell me this thing's an hour long

3452
03:33:35,680 --> 03:33:37,420
That is a long time

3453
03:33:37,420 --> 03:33:43,950
It would that would be live action. Yeah live action garfield night

3454
03:33:47,209 --> 03:33:49,209
Why did you agree to it? I don't know

3455
03:33:50,200 --> 03:33:55,930
See, I just did I said I was gonna skim through it and I still will

3456
03:34:00,889 --> 03:34:03,370
No viewer gets an hour dedicated to them

3457
03:34:05,290 --> 03:34:06,409
well that

3458
03:34:06,409 --> 03:34:08,969
Because then if you don't if I don't put like a cap on it, then

3459
03:34:09,690 --> 03:34:16,600
You watch this one hour video. Why don't you watch mine watch my video of why I don't want to watch your video

3460
03:34:16,600 --> 03:34:19,239
Well, why the fuck no you watch garfield's hour long video

3461
03:34:19,799 --> 03:34:20,920
Yeah, I

3462
03:34:20,920 --> 03:34:23,479
Oh, I did. Okay. What what's yours?

3463
03:34:24,120 --> 03:34:34,799
Gotta put some kind of cap on it, but I will I promise I will watch at least a handful of the clips

3464
03:34:42,319 --> 03:34:44,319
One hour long. Ayaya is mine

3465
03:34:47,840 --> 03:34:54,350
I will watch it garfield. I promise not the whole thing some of it pieces of it clips

03:36:03,120 --> 03:36:07,020
I don't think I want to do that

3476
03:36:07,020 --> 03:36:12,319
And i'm not going to

3477

3491
03:37:14,809 --> 03:37:20,809
After watching you for about five minutes her mom asked us if you were clinically insane. I just said probably

03:37:21,850 --> 03:37:35,450
Anyways, german keep up the great work. Thanks for the thousand bits. Appreciate it and

Thanks a lot you two

3531
03:41:33,709 --> 03:41:37,389
I'm shocked and honored that somebody would think that was worth doing in front of people

3532
03:41:38,430 --> 03:41:42,829
And admitting that you've seen that video by the way, that's like another one that i'm happy. Thanks for that, too

3533
03:41:55,920 --> 03:41:57,920

03:43:59,690 --> 03:44:02,809
I've had to watch a lot of old soviet movies, which are all public domain

03:44:03,129 --> 03:44:08,200
That'll ship for tempkin alexander nevsky man with a movie camera

3555
03:44:08,280 --> 03:44:13,159
There's a lot of really good ones from around 1920 to 1930 might be worth checking out

03:44:13,159 --> 03:44:21,389
Some are pretty crazy and silly. Hey if this goes over well tomorrow

3557

A terracotta soldier tomb for you so your subscribers can follow you into the afterlife

3581
03:47:17,180 --> 03:47:21,540
Instead of weapons we can bring you gamer gear. That's freaking me out, man

3582
03:47:23,899 --> 03:47:28,379
That's funny to a point where if I don't know no, that's too weird

03:47:28,940 --> 03:47:34,020
No, no, I I want to I want to get cremated. I want my ashes to be fucking spread

Don't say that

3587
03:47:57,309 --> 03:47:59,309
Have somebody snort your ashes

3588
03:48:00,110 --> 03:48:02,479
What so they can get my power?

3589
03:48:03,889 --> 03:48:08,860

03:49:02,270 --> 03:49:09,569
Thank you to mars

3601
03:49:09,729 --> 03:49:12,350
for the three dollars

3602
03:49:12,350 --> 03:49:16,110
Germa, I just want to let you know that you made a joke during last night's scream similar to a joke

3603
03:49:16,110 --> 03:49:21,309
You made in city skylines you joked about raising the price of crack to its max for just one day

3604
03:49:21,790 --> 03:49:27,149
Which is similar to when you said you'd fix every problem in your city by raising all taxes to 100% for a day

3605
03:49:27,950 --> 03:49:29,950
I just thought you should know this also. I am high

3606
03:49:34,770 --> 03:49:42,260
Uh that that is that a joke or is that a business strategy he mars for the three dollars

3607
03:49:43,219 --> 03:49:48,629
Let's link this one here to make sure you can see it. It's called bia wall

3608
03:50:03,889 --> 03:50:05,889
Hey urdevious, thanks for the 260

3609
03:50:07,250 --> 03:50:12,129
Jeremiah I go to northeastern the school that the rats played

3610
03:50:13,090 --> 03:50:17,379
School that did the rats play I can guarantee if you showed up to do a talk

3611
03:50:17,379 --> 03:50:20,020
There would be at least like a hundred people who would show up

3612
03:50:20,739 --> 03:50:22,739
You're really popular here

3613
03:50:23,299 --> 03:50:25,299
Please come give a ted talk

3614
03:50:25,540 --> 03:50:27,540
on centennial quad

3615
03:50:32,590 --> 03:50:45,340
At least a hundred people would go cult leader cult leader god damn it

3616
03:50:52,219 --> 03:50:54,219
Germa is actually a celebrity

3617
03:50:55,309 --> 03:51:03,379
in one place

3618
03:51:03,459 --> 03:51:05,459
Germa in 3d. Yeah

3619
03:51:07,090 --> 03:51:11,489
I'd have to want to do something. I wouldn't be able to come talk about anything. I would need a plan

3620
03:51:12,450 --> 03:51:23,420
That's stupid enough for me to want to do though maybe in the future. Who knows they would even let me

3621
03:51:25,020 --> 03:51:29,569
What about the musical

3622
03:51:29,889 --> 03:51:33,219
I I don't I don't think so

3623
03:51:34,340 --> 03:51:38,879
Just go look at me for an hour

3624
03:51:39,520 --> 03:51:49,809
No, it would never let me back in

3625
03:51:50,450 --> 03:52:03,819
I'm not doing it. But thank you ty. Thank you tile go maniac the three bucks on the topic of schooling. Yes

3626
03:52:04,799 --> 03:52:06,819
most

3627
03:52:06,899 --> 03:52:09,860
Somebody's beating something of this is speedrun in three seconds. What the fuck?

3628
03:52:12,909 --> 03:52:14,670
Uh, thank you tile

3629
03:52:14,670 --> 03:52:19,309
They say on the topic of schooling. Yes, most everything has been moved online. It's really interesting how things are being handled

3630
03:52:19,950 --> 03:52:24,829
It's hard to stay motivated in the same place where I normally would relax and work on personal projects

3631
03:52:25,389 --> 03:52:28,829
Motivation is motivation is a bitch. We're just all trying our best

3632
03:52:29,469 --> 03:52:32,350
Thanks for the entertainment while this whack-ass shit plays out

3633
03:52:35,149 --> 03:52:36,510
Yeah

3634
03:52:36,510 --> 03:52:38,510
No, that makes it makes total sense

3635
03:52:39,809 --> 03:52:42,690
Separating your work and your play

3636
03:52:43,809 --> 03:52:45,889
It's actually a really good idea

3637
03:52:45,889 --> 03:52:49,409
And if you can't then you sort of kind of mix them together and it's it's

3638
03:52:49,969 --> 03:52:56,129
Doesn't work out so well for a lot of people. I'm one of them. I know we make you use that term office

3639
03:52:57,170 --> 03:53:02,530
But if if I didn't have my computer and my monitors and my desk in a different room

3640
03:53:04,260 --> 03:53:06,340
I'm not I would I think it would be kind of fucked up

3641
03:53:07,059 --> 03:53:11,709
Like it has to be like this. I have to have it in here. It has to be like in a separate area

3642
03:53:13,540 --> 03:53:15,219
So I can imagine

3643
03:53:15,219 --> 03:53:18,129
Especially something like schoolwork. Well, you need that environment

3644
03:53:18,690 --> 03:53:26,500
But yeah, hopefully it is over soon

3645
03:53:28,579 --> 03:53:30,579
Everybody wants this in the rearview mirror

3646
03:53:31,180 --> 03:53:32,139
so

3647
03:53:32,139 --> 03:53:34,739
People can try to go back to normal

3648
03:53:34,739 --> 03:53:37,780
Just a question of when how and logistically how does that work?

3649
03:53:38,500 --> 03:53:41,309
Hopefully over the coming months we can figure that out

3650
03:53:41,709 --> 03:53:50,079
Thanks for the three bucks. Thank you

3651
03:53:50,700 --> 03:53:55,440

Hopefully somebody gave you bits for your birthday

3656
03:54:15,139 --> 03:54:28,850
Did you did you have a birthday party and have have did somebody send you bits send them back send the bits back?

3657
03:54:29,649 --> 03:54:31,649
I don't have the capability to do that

3658
03:54:31,809 --> 03:54:35,579
What does it say? What does it say? All refunds are?

3659
03:54:36,459 --> 03:54:47,020
Um final or whatever it was what's the thing I got it right all sales are final. Happy birthday though emily

All right here. I don't know. I I don't know. Let me just make sure this is what this is

3670
03:55:29,600 --> 03:55:39,309
There's not something else

3671
03:55:41,469 --> 03:55:49,420
Okay, I guess that is what it is, um, this is the video um spoilers for the sopranos maybe I don't know

03:55:49,979 --> 03:55:52,610
Thanks for the five dollars

I love the pivot that nintendo did with the orchestral mixes they've done for the mario games since mario galaxy

3676
03:56:07,329 --> 03:56:12,420
good choice

3677
03:56:12,420 --> 03:56:15,059
16 seconds of spoilers probably that's what i'm saying. Just be careful

3678
03:56:15,700 --> 03:56:18,510

The rest of my senior year is being done online

I mean

3690
03:57:09,920 --> 03:57:12,319
People used to get married in world of warcraft, didn't they?

3691
03:57:14,370 --> 03:57:17,579
Nothing wrong with that

3692
03:57:17,579 --> 03:57:23,229
Yeah, just do it like warcraft. They still do. Yeah, it's fine

3693
03:57:23,709 --> 03:57:31,280
And we got more we got a couple more songs to put on here. We have I think two or three

3694
03:57:32,479 --> 03:57:35,010
I think this is called uh, try another

3695
03:57:59,979 --> 03:58:07,010
That's pretty good I can't link this one because it was not put anywhere besides in the discord

3696
03:58:07,569 --> 03:58:10,290
I do want to stress one more time very very loudly

3697
03:58:11,469 --> 03:58:12,770
uh

3698
03:58:12,770 --> 03:58:18,549
Please put your images your links if you can get them on a website

3699
03:58:18,850 --> 03:58:28,100
Because this is my on my computer. I had to download it get it on a site like a youtube or a like even like a soundcloud

3700
03:58:29,500 --> 03:58:30,379
or

3701
03:58:30,379 --> 03:58:35,500
Directly in the discord can work but it's easier for me if it's on like an actual website

3702
03:58:36,139 --> 03:58:45,840
Turn down your mic. That was good though. This one's called german nightmare music

3703
03:58:46,639 --> 03:58:53,739
I've had like we're getting fucked up dreams with this song would play in the background. Yeah, this is bad. I don't know where

3704
03:58:55,250 --> 03:58:56,209
and

3705
03:58:56,209 --> 03:58:58,209
The tempo was decreased

3706
03:58:59,780 --> 03:59:01,780
Holy shit, this is fucking

3707
03:59:06,659 --> 03:59:08,659
Oh you asshole

3708
03:59:10,659 --> 03:59:13,719
Holy shit, it's exactly the way it is in my nightmare

3709
03:59:35,200 --> 03:59:41,219
Fuck oh my god, it's harmful

3710
03:59:42,100 --> 03:59:52,510
I can't listen to this anymore. This is exactly what it's like when I in the nightmare

3711
03:59:59,700 --> 04:00:04,579
Oh, thank you for that one. I don't know who you were but why I didn't know
