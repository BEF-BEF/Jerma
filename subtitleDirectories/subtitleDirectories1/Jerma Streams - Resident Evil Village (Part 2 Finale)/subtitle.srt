1
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:36,119
Did it work? What the hell was that? I don't know why it reverted back to 720p for no reason.

2
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:45,929
Output, scaled resolution, 1536x864 selected. Done. No, I had to click on use custom resolution,

3
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:53,960
put in a custom one, hit apply and then hit done. But there's a drop down menu where I can select

4
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:59,899
it. I hate this program with a passion. It's like one of three programs that exist to stream on.

5
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:14,069
You have three choices. Curly, Moe, and Larry. Alright, anyways, hi guys. How's everybody doing?

6
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:27,180
Which one is this? I don't know. Now you're gonna ask me to go stream on like the NVIDIA

7
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:37,980
fucking shadowplay. I'm not gonna do that. That's not gonna happen. I was doing fine until I had

8
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:43,180
to restart my stream fucking and give notifications to people that it just dumped on a bunch of people

9
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:58,019
and they all saw no stream. Fucking real happy about that. YouTube streamings made- no, no

10
00:01:58,019 --> 00:02:09,900
YouTube streaming. I bet Jaren's playing this on easy baby mode. I'm playing it on- listen to my voice.

11
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:16,759
I'm cured. Not 900p. You're not actually- you're not supposed to stream at 900p.

12
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:23,979
Did some research. It's actually kind of- it's actually a little worse.

13
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,539
Something to do with how like the pixels get broadcasted or something. I don't know.

14
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,020
Anyways, why does everything have to start with so- I swear to god. Like everything just starts so

15
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:51,289
negatively. Why doesn't shit just work? It's 964, not 864. Yeah, well whatever.

16
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:59,770
Did you remember to get the FOV mod? I didn't get the FOV mod because I've been playing the game

17
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:06,900
at 81 FOV the whole time and I've gotten used to it already. So I'm just gonna play the way

18
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:12,500
the developer is intended. The 20- never mind. I don't want to get into this. I don't- no,

19
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:17,379
we're not starting every stream with like- I'm angry. Okay, that can't happen. But just it

20
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:27,750
somehow happens that every time I start a stream something annoying happens. Every time. We're

21
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:36,439
gonna continue. No, don't blame me. Blame our annoying world we live in. It's not me,

22
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:59,830
it's our annoying world. It's- it's our society. Angry. Angsty. I'm not angsty. I'm fine. I'm like

23
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:10,060
a can of soda. Don't you understand? Like when you open up a can of soda like- a bunch of fucking

24
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:17,269
like rage- air comes out of it. And it tastes really really good for like 20 minutes. After

25
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:24,439
like an hour or two of the soda sitting there, it's gross. Don't shake me up either. Don't shake

26
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:44,730
me up! Though it does not imply to stop watching the stream after like 30 minutes. Don't do that.

27
00:04:44,730 --> 00:05:06,839
Stay. Next game? What? No. I'm playing Resident Evil Village. See you after 30 minutes.

28
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:18,620
All right, so what do we leave off? Did I get a beard in one day? I think this was here yesterday,

29
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:26,620
it was dark. Planned your whole day around this stream? I didn't even tweet this stream was live.

30
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:43,129
Did I? No, I didn't. Did I? Did I? No, there's no tweet. Hope everyone's doing well. Hope you're

31
00:05:43,129 --> 00:05:47,370
having a good day. I know we went for- I can't- no, I can't do that transition. It doesn't work like

32
00:05:47,370 --> 00:06:00,060
that. Hey, how is everybody doing? Hope you're having a great day. Yeah, good to see you. You

33
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:12,819
can't start that angry and be like, oh hey, by the way, how's your day? Finishing RE Village.

34
00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:25,769
Somebody said I have really boring tweets. I mean, I don't- I don't even use Twitter. Okay,

35
00:06:25,769 --> 00:06:39,779
there we go. Boring tweets. What else do I have to tell you? So if I'm- okay, if I'm playing

36
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:46,220
Resident Evil Village today, like I'm playing Resident Evil Village right now, come on over

37
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:51,420
if you want to, right? Why do I have to have- I'll add like a bunch of like fucking like emojis and

38
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:57,339
shit. And like- I don't know, like dancing GIFs. Like I don't- that- I'm just- I'm live right now.

39
00:06:57,339 --> 00:07:03,079
Come watch or- or don't. I'm sure- you know what? I'm sure- here, how about this, ready?

40
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:06,949
Let's do an experiment. Let's see how many more engagements I get. I want someone to clip

41
00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:12,199
this and GIF it. You know what I mean? Like I gotta have like a cool like I'm going live tweet,

42
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:27,220
right? Like- and then like loop that and I'll use it tomorrow. Oh, not tomorrow, next week.

43
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:50,089
Going live! You gonna show up? That was terrible. Doesn't have to be good. Lazy comedy? No, it's

44
00:07:50,089 --> 00:07:58,259
just like I- like I just tell you that I'm live. I don't have to do anything else. That's visible

45
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:05,910
regret. Not really. All right, so where we going? Uh, underwater. Those of you that didn't see the

46
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:13,509
stream yesterday, we got to a point. We got to, uh, three out of the four pieces of a thing. If

47
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:19,060
you haven't seen any of the game, this is a spoiler. If you don't want to get spoiled,

48
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:25,509
the Resident Evil Village and I suggest you close your ears. This is like my daughter's body, okay?

49
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:31,209
Uh, we need the- I'm on the third piece right now. We got it, but it's not the end. We have to

50
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:43,320
go through this weird puke guy that falls in the river. Double audio. Might have a- had a- might

51
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:50,779
have an audio problem? What happened? I don't have any drop frames. Looks good on my end.

52
00:08:50,779 --> 00:08:59,580
Does something happen? I have zero drop frames for now. All right, so, uh, we- this is like the swamp

53
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:10,250
level. And I got a- I have a code here. This is the code. It's three red, one two three tic tac toe,

54
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:16,779
and then two blue, and then solid blue top right. So I'll represent- if somebody will screenshot

55
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:26,389
that and just give it to me later, that's good. You can hear the audio twice? It's echoing. The game

56
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:39,529
is echoing. The game audio is weird? Is it? The game audio. How would that be happening?

57
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:50,059
Oh, am I getting trolled? Why are you doing this to me? It's fine. Hold on, let me do a test.

58
00:09:51,659 --> 00:10:02,279
We good? It's not one guy? It's fine. Okay, all right. Mod just said it's fine. I'm going

59
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:14,659
perfectly fine. It's fine. Okay, all right, all right, all right. Why is- why is everyone doing

60
00:10:14,659 --> 00:10:23,419
this? All right, so I gotta go down. The exit's underwater. I gotta drain the water.

61
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:28,379
So the question is now go- oh, that way, because the chicken. Yep, okay. All right, all right,

62
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:32,980
I know what I'm going. I know what I'm doing. We like to do a little bit of trolling here in

63
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:42,200
this community. It's literally not fine. I cannot think of a reason why this would be happening,

64
00:10:42,200 --> 00:11:11,769
though. It's actually definitely echoing. It's doubled? Hold on. It's not like playing my stream

65
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:22,940
in the background, right? No. Is your stream muted in the other window? Yeah, yeah, it should be fine.

66
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:26,860
I don't know why that would- that's really weird. It's the game audio doing it.

67
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:35,340
Let me see. It's not actually a troll. It sounds like the audio is going through a fan.

68
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:40,700
It's got a weird echo effect. It only sounds fine because it's a sound effect not spoken.

69
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:52,600
When Ethan spoke right at the beginning, it was noticeably weird. I'm so confused. Nothing

70
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:59,929
changed from yesterday besides talk to Duke to confirm it. All right, yeah, this is- that's

71
00:11:59,929 --> 00:12:06,519
really strange. I don't know why this would be happening. Let me go- hold on.

72
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:55,539
How's that? It's there. It's kind of weird. Let me restart the game and see what happens.

73
00:12:56,179 --> 00:13:03,940
It's like metallic? Yeah, let me just restart because I don't hear that, though.

74
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:10,019
It sounds normal to me. It sounds like he's talking inside of a pipe.

75
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:21,210
Oh, let me see. We deleted the links. Yeah, that sounds perfectly normal to me.

76
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:25,379
Let me just- let me restart the game. Hold on. Give me one sec. Give me one second.

77
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:50,789
Sounds cool. You should leave. This is very strange. Sounds like it's being piped into OBS

78
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:55,269
twice. Like we're getting desktop and also a separate input for the game, like a capture card.

79
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:57,750
Let me listen to it. Hold on. That's really weird.

80
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:03,259
As you wish.

81
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:16,789
What the fuck is going on? What? That's so weird. Why is that happening? Yeah, it's- it's playing

82
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:22,490
twice. The audio is playing twice, right next to each other, but nothing is doing that.

83
00:14:23,049 --> 00:14:31,590
Hold on. Let me see. The only thing pulling audio is the GoXLR and the routing on the GoXLR is-

84
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:45,110
so now I'm pulling myself in here. Okay, so that shouldn't be happening. This is so weird. Okay,

85
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:50,820
um, I'm gonna try to pull it through one more time and see if it fixes it because this- I

86
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:58,220
cannot think of a solution as why this would be happening. Try it again. Hold on. The only thing

87
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:06,220
that changed is I changed it to- I moved my OBS settings to make it so it would stream at

88
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:15,340
864 and I made my CPU preset slower so it would look better. That's the only thing I did. Let me-

89
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,700
hold on. Let me just confirm something with you guys right now. I'm gonna like play a sound effect.

90
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:33,340
Tell me if it sounds weird. Ready? Did that sound weird? Was that echoed at all or anything?

91
00:15:34,379 --> 00:15:39,509
That one sounds fine. So why would- so wouldn't- hold on. Maybe it was just a Resident Evil

92
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:44,580
problem. Try this again. Oh, I'm sorry. The technical fucking problem's Andy.

93
00:15:45,220 --> 00:16:05,960
Choose a different sound effect. Let's try a different sound effect. Well, that one has

94
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:16,889
reverb on it. That doesn't help us. That one has reverb. That one has echo. How about just like,

95
00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:33,220
I don't know, like man talking. Okay, how about- or just like punch sound. This would do it, right?

96
00:16:33,779 --> 00:17:03,700
How's that? It auto-played. Hold on. Hold on. Oh shit! All right, I got the problem. I know

97
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:08,019
the problem is I got it. Problem is done. Problem has been solved. I figured it out. We're okay.

98
00:17:08,019 --> 00:17:12,500
Everybody's fine. We're gonna play Resident Evil Village now. Problem has been figured out.

99
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:20,420
I got it. I should got it. Let's see. There it is. Okay, we're good.

100
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:35,619
The problem was for some reason it was pulling my audio twice. I don't know why this shit happens.

101
00:17:35,619 --> 00:17:46,779
I'm so- I'm as confused as you guys are. Trust me. That definitely- that absolutely fixed it.

102
00:17:46,779 --> 00:18:01,430
No way. No chance that it didn't. Let's come back. Hello. Hi. We should be good to go.

103
00:18:02,069 --> 00:18:08,299
I don't think I've ever- have I ever- have I ever had a normal fucking stream? Like, has a stream

104
00:18:08,299 --> 00:18:14,819
ever started normally? Ever. Every stream it's always like something weird happens or like I'm

105
00:18:14,819 --> 00:18:19,779
fucking mad at everything. There's never been a normal start to a stream. I have to get- I have

106
00:18:19,779 --> 00:18:25,400
to get normal. I have to have a normal start to a stream. Like, hi guys. How's everybody doing?

107
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:36,859
Mm-hmm. Resident Evil Village part two incoming here. Here we are. We were at the gatehouse last

108
00:18:36,859 --> 00:19:04,700
time because you're not normal. Yes, I am. I am. How dare you say that? Did it fix it? We're good,

109
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:14,339
I think. Yeah. Get to the game already. I'm trying, man. I'm sorry. All right, let's go.

110
00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:25,220
It's been 20 fucking minutes. I hate my streamer ability. All right, let's go. No, wrong way.

111
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:33,720
He said the exit's under the water. Don't be normal. Well, sometimes I have to be. Like,

112
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:38,630
for instance, I got a job interview. I just wish that one stream would start where I don't like

113
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:46,710
curse out a company. I tell- you know what's wicked funny? Last night I was lying in bed

114
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:52,230
and I said to myself, I said, you know what? I'm from- I'm not gonna like curse any more companies

115
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:55,910
anymore. I'm just gonna like just, you know, if I'm annoyed, I'll just be annoyed. Cursed out a

116
00:19:55,910 --> 00:20:00,150
company the first fucking five seconds of the stream. I actually cursed a company out and then

117
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:07,579
turned the stream off and came back. All right, I already have the crank. I think I do, right? Yeah.

118
00:20:07,579 --> 00:20:13,660
Oh, no, no, no. I did not. I did this part after. All right, so I got the crank.

119
00:20:16,059 --> 00:20:22,119
I broke the crank off. I said, well, that's annoying, right? So I had said get to the

120
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:26,569
second windmill. So we're going to try to get to the second windmill. We're normal. I'm normal

121
00:20:26,569 --> 00:20:31,259
today. Somebody gave 10 community- thanks for the 10 community subs. Appreciate it. That was from

122
00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:36,440
Void. Thanks for the 10 community subs. 10 of them. That's a lot of money. Thank you.

123
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,140
What part am I on? This is uh, I'm just gonna say- I'm gonna say Igor and then maybe you'll know

124
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:49,990
what that means. I got that and I had to find a way to the second windmill. I'm gonna be normal

125
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:56,809
today. No like fucking weird movements. No like screaming and shit. No cursing out Fortune 500

126
00:20:56,809 --> 00:21:02,170
companies to take me off the guest list of every fucking exclusive party I could ever be invited

127
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:17,289
to. No more of that. I'm normal today. I'm gonna try to go inside, right? Go in and then down. All

128
00:21:17,289 --> 00:21:25,099
right. Here we go. I'm normal today. Don't listen to them. Don't listen to all- like thank you Cat

129
00:21:25,099 --> 00:21:38,619
Sum for the five community subs. Here comes a joke. No, I'm gonna be normal. I wanted to so badly do

130
00:21:38,619 --> 00:21:48,339
like a beat to that, but that would not be normal. Now would it? All right, let's- I'm gonna- let's

131
00:21:48,339 --> 00:21:52,740
make a little friendly bet here. Let's see how long I can be normal. Like just like just normal.

132
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:58,519
I'm gonna say- I'm gonna try to go for 10 minutes of just normal. No, nothing. Just be a normal- just

133
00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:10,680
be a fucking normal person. Just sit here and play a game. 10 minutes starting now. Ooh, cool. Oh,

134
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:16,549
does it look better? That's another question I have. How much better does the stream look?

135
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:28,089
Does it look good? Better than yesterday? Looks about the same. Looks a little bit better. A bit

136
00:22:28,089 --> 00:22:39,799
better. Same. Not as good as you. Thanks. Okay, let me keep walking. Ooh, we can break that.

137
00:22:39,799 --> 00:23:15,500
Normal's boring. Let me just see if I- I lost! Holy shit! I died? That was it? I got really scared

138
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:19,660
and I looked into the camera and I realized that was being weird so I just made it- I- okay. I made

139
00:23:19,819 --> 00:23:26,180
extra weird. I was like- I looked over, I turned, I saw like in the preview over here how weird I

140
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:38,150
looked, and then I was like I'll add some weirdness to it because I already lost.

141
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:42,950
Lost to normal wheel. All right, so just don't get eaten. That's easier said than done.

142
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:52,700
I'll rip and run! All right, is there a place I can hide? I don't know where to go. This way?

143
00:23:57,509 --> 00:24:13,779
Where the- where am I? Where do I go? Ah! What does that do? Oh my god, he's gonna jump and kill me.

144
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:38,549

145
00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:49,319

274
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:17,210
again but heisenberg said that was why we each get a rose the ceremony cannot happen without us

275
01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:23,900
all there mother didn't seem to care though we all need a rose we each get a rose mother said

276
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:30,059
rose is a vessel with a vessel mother can get her real child back even though she has been dead for

277
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:36,380
a very long time this is going to be a scenario where like i'm like this is mother is just mia

278
01:00:37,610 --> 01:00:45,590
and this is like some weird twisted thing like even though she's been dead for a very long time

279
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:51,510
but if mother does then what will happen to me i'm not her real child would she abandon me no i

311
01:09:34,810 --> 01:09:47,960

315
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:36,180
evil because you save it you you you get like 10 bullets for it and you wait till the final boss

and you shoot the final boss like seven or eight times with the magnum and win

317
01:10:40,819 --> 01:10:57,220

516
02:03:09,289 --> 02:03:16,699
anytime you see like a highly explosive device in one of these games something horrible happens

517
02:03:50,250 --> 02:04:12,649
oh you're climbing i'm almost at a handgun bullets i need handgun ammo i should really

518
02:04:12,649 --> 02:04:17,619
craft some i told you i'm a i'm a big handgun guy i love using handguns in games it's what i

519
02:04:17,619 --> 02:04:26,840
use the most the reason why i'm not good at counter-strike or any of those games that require

520
02:04:26,840 --> 02:04:32,649
you to be like good at a video game is because i can't do like the crouch and hit people and

521
02:04:32,649 --> 02:04:39,189
hit no but you give me the deagle and i'll go bump up i'll hit you i can win but like i always get

522
02:04:39,189 --> 02:04:48,789
outplayed by the person that can like crouch shoot you a crowd let's get this door open how

523
02:04:48,789 --> 02:05:01,479
do we do it is that what is back here there's a treasure over here somewhere like right here

524
02:05:01,479 --> 02:05:26,060
doesn't hurt you right standing on top of it is that it right there no wait what there's gotta

525
02:05:26,060 --> 02:05:33,659
be a way i think it's up read the name of the treasure treasure under the stronghold

526
02:05:34,859 --> 02:05:59,859
it's not above me then all right a way up a way up way is shot it was made for those who are dead

527
02:06:00,500 --> 02:06:09,159
this is peter jackson's least favorite part of the movie he wanted to delete this part he was so

528
02:06:09,159 --> 02:06:13,319
desperate to remove this part from the movie because he's despised and he thought it was too

529
02:06:13,319 --> 02:06:55,460
long it's true okay there it is where the shot that why am i streaming at 864p i don't know i

535
02:08:06,630 --> 02:08:12,710
gpu was 75 degrees peak temperature of the memory on the gpu was 90 degrees celsius that seems kind

536
02:08:12,710 --> 02:08:25,399
of high my cpu is 77 right now the maximum that it was during this stream was 84 degrees celsius

537

574
02:20:55,909 --> 02:21:01,559
potentially the most powerful entity they can change the course of all history you know that

575
02:21:01,559 --> 02:21:08,149
if you've been in this community for long enough what do you mean one guy who is a typewriter

576
02:21:22,229 --> 02:21:38,069
not more of that shit is there what is in the water there was something in the water

577
02:21:49,319 --> 02:21:53,639
i'm gonna break through the wall this is way too close for there not to be something smashed

578
02:21:53,639 --> 02:22:32,139
through this this is like bloodborne my eyes are so watery i don't think i've blinked the king's

579
02:22:32,139 --> 02:22:39,860
orders the kids stop israel free palestine just gave 10 community subs thanks for the community

580
02:22:39,860 --> 02:22:58,280
subs thank you for those subs oh well the king's orders finally arrived withdraw it is most vexing

581
02:22:58,280 --> 02:23:03,659
that we must abandon the border stronghold to those heretics if i had but a little more time i

582
02:23:03,659 --> 02:23:08,809
know i might be able to turn the tides of this battle uh nay i should not put on air as it is

583
02:23:08,809 --> 02:23:21,350
my curiosity that ties me to this place nice accent i'm not putting on an accent everybody

584
02:23:21,350 --> 02:23:42,549
you just got political i know we gotta play resident evil so what rule number two that's

585
02:23:42,549 --> 02:23:48,950
it's not it's just a lot of crazy shit going on in the world right now a lot of crazy shit going

586
02:23:48,950 --> 02:24:02,299
on in the world right now so i don't know about you guys but i use this this place here as i can

587
02:24:02,299 --> 02:24:13,299
escape from myself the world is fucking crazy right now this is my place to have fun and kind

588
02:24:13,299 --> 02:24:22,409
of forget about it if i'm completely honest it's a it's a way to just kind of enjoy what's going

589
02:24:22,409 --> 02:24:31,219
on here right now um and we don't really talk about very many things on this stream and that's

590
02:24:31,219 --> 02:24:39,819
because i don't want to because what i want to do here is take myself away from that kind of stuff

591
02:24:40,700 --> 02:24:51,079
i want to take myself away from it and enjoy this we make little jokes you've heard me do

592
02:24:51,079 --> 02:24:56,600
like fucking trump impressions and we talked about like joe biden is gonna watch bionicle with you

593
02:24:56,600 --> 02:25:02,840
but like i think that's just like little dumb shit that we do sometimes but this place is for

594
02:25:02,920 --> 02:25:07,079
me just to come fuck around and forget about the wild fucking crazy world we actually live in

595
02:25:10,979 --> 02:25:16,860
so if you want opinions of mine on things you're probably not going to get them here

596
02:25:19,540 --> 02:25:28,069
81 fov was way more contentious than to you because that's this place here right now

597
02:25:36,440 --> 02:25:43,059
i use streaming and just fucking around with you guys as a way to just kind of forget about

598
02:25:43,059 --> 02:25:47,219
shit and escape from the goddamn crazy world we're in and i kind of want to keep it that way

599
02:25:48,500 --> 02:26:03,129
so there you go 70 fov is too much with that we're going to continue and play resident evil

600
02:26:03,129 --> 02:26:13,260
you don't got to explain yourself no but i mean so i mean sometimes i do because the world is so

601
02:26:13,260 --> 02:26:21,579
crazy that you know it's it's stuff just shit look at the look at the last year it's hard to

602
02:26:21,579 --> 02:26:30,250
ignore the last year of crazy shit we had like a we had a covet 19 coronavirus that like shut the

603
02:26:30,250 --> 02:26:38,360
whole world down it's hard to like escape from that but you know i try you still owe us a left

604
02:26:38,360 --> 02:26:54,379
for dead stream you lost one k of viewers while saying saying what oh what did i say you can be

605
02:26:54,379 --> 02:27:05,059
emotionally taxing it can and i don't don't get me wrong do not twist the statements i'm gonna

606
02:27:05,059 --> 02:27:10,420
that i've been making here i put a lot of private thought and a lot of personal thought into tons

607
02:27:10,420 --> 02:27:17,850
of stuff going on in the world this is this is like my place to come escape and have fun

608
02:27:17,850 --> 02:27:36,489
that's all i'm gonna say let's continue anyways here we go save the game did i get the fourth one

02:27:36,489 --> 02:27:44,299
no you should try taking lsd why would i take lsd i don't you i don't want to take drugs

610
02:27:47,659 --> 02:27:50,780
the way that i like see the world and the way that like my brain works up here

611
02:27:51,739 --> 02:27:56,540
i think i would literally i would probably start to fly like i but maybe i would i would

612
02:27:56,780 --> 02:28:03,829

652
02:39:46,100 --> 02:40:07,690
i know it's gonna scare me yeah please those of you that wonder how i make do that sound

653
02:40:07,690 --> 02:40:14,889
just watch my cheeks babies i would like some babies babies babies babies babies it's just filling

654
02:40:14,889 --> 02:40:32,010
my cheeks with air and then expelling it quickly babies babies i believe this is a shortcut of some

655
02:40:32,010 --> 02:40:44,329
sort so it's cool that there is a shortcut system in this game but what the hell for what what is

656
02:40:44,329 --> 02:41:00,680
this for like for what this doesn't really do anything because i mean i guess i could go sell

657
02:41:00,680 --> 02:41:19,500
and craft again before continuing but do i really care to do that i guess they're gonna give it to

658
02:41:19,500 --> 02:41:35,620
me might as well from here i need to go straight down i can't i missed a shiny you have about

659
02:41:35,620 --> 02:41:50,040
three hours left it's exactly what i thought too where's the shiny it's precisely what i thought

660
02:41:50,040 --> 02:42:00,340
too all right what's the fastest way for me to get i probably need to go this way yeah just go

661
02:42:00,340 --> 02:42:19,540
around that way i'll sell what the hell was that why what was the what was the big t-rex growl for

662
02:42:23,450 --> 02:42:32,729
you know i probably could do a t-rex growl let me try let me see let me see if i can do a t-rex

663
02:42:32,729 --> 02:42:39,860
growl let me see let me see if it can get it to work okay so this is kind of fucked up

664
02:42:40,180 --> 02:42:48,170
you see that's not what it's supposed to sound like hello hello hello hello hello hello hello

665
02:42:55,319 --> 02:43:03,899
i can't do it why is it doing that though it doesn't sound right this one's is yesterday

666
02:43:03,899 --> 02:43:11,450
it was i did this and i did the same knob so i did this same knob yesterday and now it's a

667
02:43:11,450 --> 02:43:19,700
different sound coming out of it i don't know why don't ask me why but the idea was i was gonna go

668
02:43:21,620 --> 02:43:35,659
that's close that's kind of close that's chewy that was not chewy that was the t-rex from

669
02:43:35,659 --> 02:43:49,180
Jurassic Park one stop you're hurting him that was not chewy chewy is like a

670

854
03:38:46,870 --> 03:39:11,129
elevator but what's over here something in here they're like keeping something closed in here

855
03:39:18,149 --> 03:39:39,819
some kind of locking mechanism looks easy to break let's test it out on this guy pretty damn

856
03:39:39,819 --> 03:40:01,450
good if you ask me all right what we got a lot of places to go this can't be opened from here

859
03:40:57,610 --> 03:41:12,489
more ammo for the handgun because i really do like it a lot his brain how's the game i have to pee

860
03:41:12,489 --> 03:41:26,100
sure you have a few minutes i would say you have a minute maybe one maybe two okay so something

861
03:41:26,100 --> 03:41:57,479
goes here i'm like square metal object or some mold that is missed three times so what's the

862
03:41:57,479 --> 03:42:04,790
are they making like weird like soldiers or something well i don't understand i've played

863
03:42:04,790 --> 03:42:12,549
almost every single resident evil game and i still i don't understand what the whole point is

864
03:42:13,430 --> 03:42:21,500
all i remember is like ah yes we have this virus it's a virus and that's we need it to have we need

865
03:42:22,219 --> 03:42:25,899
we have a virus and i don't remember like why there was ever a virus

866
03:42:26,620 --> 03:42:37,700
she's like oh we made this virus to make uh the guns a bio weapon right but i mean over like

867
03:42:38,340 --> 03:42:47,110
like 30 straight years bio weapon shit never worked like we've got eight nine ten video

868
03:42:47,110 --> 03:42:55,719
games of them failing to make a bio weapon like can't we just go back to fucking swords

869
03:42:55,719 --> 03:42:59,079
and shit like i don't like we're still looking for a bio weapon

870
03:43:00,200 --> 03:43:06,520
oh yeah see this is this is the j the 5g virus the t virus the b virus the a virus the tyrant

871
03:43:06,520 --> 03:43:16,329
virus like wesker it didn't fucking work it's not it's not working it doesn't work i don't i'm like

872
03:43:16,329 --> 03:43:25,579

873
03:43:25,579 --> 03:43:42,500

912
03:53:01,299 --> 03:53:09,270
what 29 27 hours of game time i'm a completionist i do like 100 of every game essentially

913
03:53:10,500 --> 03:53:15,940
um i'm kind of like people have called me uh the wizard from the wizard from vegas you know

914
03:53:15,940 --> 03:53:21,620
because like i i get in i figure out everything and i i just figured out all the completion

915
03:53:21,620 --> 03:53:27,420
routes and i try to get everything as fast as i can 100 they call me the game the game wizard

916
03:53:27,420 --> 03:53:41,860
from las vegas is what i've been called before all the new people here oh god like if there's

917
03:53:41,860 --> 03:53:54,520
something to figure out in the game you know i'll find it all right well that's a shortcut back to

918
03:53:54,520 --> 03:54:20,409
there uh can we go can we jot that down for the uh for the vod the time stamp here because i want

919
03:54:20,409 --> 03:54:25,700
to make sure i put that in the video like a thing that i found for the completion of stuff so this

920
03:54:25,700 --> 03:55:09,559
is how you get to the mechanical part cylinder everybody just said shut up on me okay it's taking

921
03:55:09,559 --> 03:55:23,860
a good mental picture of exactly the layout of this map so i can remember it 100 of it i really

922
03:55:23,860 --> 03:55:38,440
don't want to okay here's this part remember this is so obscure everyone's gonna think you're a

923
03:55:38,440 --> 03:55:49,620
fucking weirdo what are you talking about why would you say something so weird you're like scaring

924
03:55:49,620 --> 03:55:55,059
people off fully grown male corpse used remove heart and implanted kadoo muscle stimulation

925
03:55:55,059 --> 03:56:01,299
via electric shock was successful brain dead so no high cognitive ability only moves by destructive

926
03:56:01,299 --> 03:56:09,299
instinct then stops attached headgear to the cranium electrodes confirm stable brain waves

927
03:56:10,260 --> 03:56:18,170
everyone lichen fight was dismantled and eaten within three minutes mechanical soldier soul sold

928
03:56:18,170 --> 03:56:23,770
that replace lower part of the arm with drill not enough output for effective movement need live

929
03:56:23,770 --> 03:56:32,250
bodies perhaps implanted kadoo reactor into the chest output greatly increased lichen fight

930
03:56:32,250 --> 03:56:37,860
destroy three lichens in one minute results with issues with reactive durability may stop

931
03:56:37,860 --> 03:56:51,819
functioning reactors destroyed okay hog mold we have to make it back to the car all right we're

932

954
04:04:51,020 --> 04:05:03,879
where they're all on the wall is your brain check the map is this why the person said this place

996
04:16:27,579 --> 04:16:45,799
he could get through that in my brain i don't know why i was like i thought it was safe so now

997
04:16:46,520 --> 04:17:04,969
get no ammo i gotta pee again too that's not good anything what's my actual goal right now

998
04:17:05,530 --> 04:17:20,379

999
04:17:21,850 --> 04:17:55,979
this vibe okay what's that i go that way you're getting lost again yeah probably

1000
04:17:56,700 --> 04:18:08,680
i'm back in this room um i have to open this door by pressing some kind of button

1001
04:18:09,399 --> 04:18:21,370
germa germa germa please fart i mean there's definitely something i have to activate over

1002
04:18:21,370 --> 04:18:40,729
here i'll take it why did i go backwards i it this is a this is a really confusing area

1003
04:18:41,530 --> 04:18:49,610
i'm not trying to go backwards uh just every backwards is forwards in my brain

1004
04:18:50,940 --> 04:18:56,379
everything looks exactly the same it's more like the concrete like fucking concrete metal

1005
04:18:56,379 --> 04:19:01,620
fucking walls and shit a bunch of like machinery in the middle like every room is machinery in the

1006
04:19:01,620 --> 04:19:30,100
middle with concrete and steel all right i remember this did i go this way i mean i killed

1007
04:19:30,100 --> 04:19:53,270
everything here i'm gonna go back up the stairs and you notice it's like the spatial shit too

1008
04:19:53,270 --> 04:19:59,159
it's like everything's just this this i can't see anything it's just every this somebody said it

1009
04:19:59,159 --> 04:20:10,409
everything just looks exactly the same like put some fucking balloons and shit like what i put

1010
04:20:10,409 --> 04:20:17,399
some fucking statues or something so i can know oh i have this i remember the balloon room

1011
04:20:17,959 --> 04:20:39,500

1014
04:21:43,190 --> 04:21:49,270
it's just like tetris pieces like you know what i mean it's just like oh this is just

1015
04:21:49,909 --> 04:21:53,430
i guess that's just a hallway that doesn't show all the machinery and shit there's no balloons

1016
04:21:54,069 --> 04:22:12,020
he hates tetris and capcom yeah i'm only playing this game out of spite because every time we turn

1017
04:22:12,020 --> 04:22:17,879
the corner we're gonna make fun of it like oh scary this is what we do in this channel we pick

why would i hate this gun this thing's awesome this thing's beautiful

1049
04:30:55,290 --> 04:30:59,690
you haven't made a sound since the stream turned on do you know that you're muted

1050
04:31:00,569 --> 04:31:11,879
that would be so stupid there's no way that twitch chat would let that go for more than five minutes

1051
04:31:21,370 --> 04:31:50,360
we can't hear you man we can't hear you you can hear me just fine just two over here

1052
04:31:52,379 --> 04:32:16,700
you know what i meant lockpick you're that was pretending to be scared you know it's funny when

1053
04:32:16,700 --> 04:32:23,350
you watch somebody play a game like this or if you want even like a friend of yours you there's

1054
04:32:23,350 --> 04:32:28,229
something about watching somebody playing a scary game and startling things versus actually doing

1055
04:32:28,229 --> 04:32:35,190
it yourself because like i've watched friends of mine play scary games and they they go they scream

1056
04:32:35,190 --> 04:32:38,709
and i'm just like i i'm sitting here watching you they why why are you so scared that wasn't

1057
04:32:38,709 --> 04:32:44,659
that scary that's really that was your reaction but when you're actually like locked into the

1058
04:32:44,659 --> 04:32:51,590
matrix it it's a lot different when it's you being attacked because this is an extension of me someone

1059
04:32:51,590 --> 04:32:55,989
just attacked me i sitting on the couch and watching somebody just get attacked it's not even

1060
04:32:55,989 --> 04:33:02,010
it's not me like you are you might have the first person perspective but you are watching me get

1061
04:33:02,010 --> 04:33:07,669
attacked you're like from a distance but like pretty much you're like 50 feet away that's why

1062
04:33:07,669 --> 04:33:31,450
is that true dude you get really immersed when you play it yourself yes and this is a circle this is

1063
04:33:31,450 --> 04:33:41,130
the square this is a rectangle look i mean it's basic all right whatever it's been all right that

1064
04:33:41,130 --> 04:34:06,779
was pretty basic but you know what i mean it that's true though yellow quartz large crystal

1065
04:34:07,799 --> 04:34:22,659
large crystal oh finally some money so low on ammo it's crazy more explosive rounds more

1066
04:34:23,540 --> 04:34:40,659
turn off your light nope more more more my favorite part of all the movies everybody thinks no just

1067
04:34:40,659 --> 04:34:45,540
when darth vader and luke like me no mine's more that's my favorite part of every single star wars

1068
04:34:45,540 --> 04:35:23,819
movie he goes more he made he does like a more the cap gun this is a cap gun ammo i'm not going

1069
04:35:23,819 --> 04:35:29,240
to shoot that last one yet that this is a this is like a fight this is a big fight get everything

1191
05:06:35,830 --> 05:06:43,419
all right now we have to go up open that other door and i i'm assuming this is probably one of

1192
05:06:43,419 --> 05:06:59,849
the major fights of the whole game or damage you do less ammo you use that's right as long as i hit

05:19:03,419 --> 05:19:12,470
mega me site the trick is that brat rose if i could access her power then maybe speaking of

1254
05:24:57,209 --> 05:25:07,319

1256
05:25:16,569 --> 05:25:26,599

1257
05:25:29,659 --> 05:25:34,459
don't go too far though don't go too far oh shit we gotta go relax my men are monitoring the

1258
05:25:34,459 --> 05:25:39,740
situation but they have my daughter and it looked good last saturday don't go more than five

1259
05:25:42,380 --> 05:25:49,740
that's the most nerve-wracking thing ever when somebody has your phone down here and finish

1260
05:25:49,740 --> 05:25:54,220
planting explosives you take that elevator i'll meet you topside when you say hey look at this

1261
05:25:54,220 --> 05:26:01,659
picture and they go oh cool yeah and they swipe and they swipe and i don't do that

1262
05:26:02,840 --> 05:26:05,880
she's a dead woman that's all i didn't do that's all i wanted to show you just that one that one

1263
05:26:05,880 --> 05:26:10,599
photo you don't need to i don't want to show you anything else all right ethan you take this

1264
05:26:11,479 --> 05:26:23,209
and do me a favor try to stay under the radar why does he have like a wesker look-alike costume on

1265
05:26:35,419 --> 05:26:39,020
owned wolf squad the sweep of the factory is complete no proof of any connection with the

1266
05:26:39,020 --> 05:26:44,619
organization guess this was just wasn't our day uh i did manage to get my hands on a number of

1267
05:26:44,619 --> 05:26:47,900
documents disclosing some of miranda's experiments which support our previous theories

1268
05:26:48,619 --> 05:26:53,500
she seems to have infected herself with the muta mesite which grants her a number of abilities

1269
05:26:53,500 --> 05:26:59,290
including mimic mimicry she can control herself and transform herself to look like anyone or

1270
05:26:59,290 --> 05:27:05,430
anything so that could have just been her she disguised herself as mia and infiltrated the

1271
05:27:05,430 --> 05:27:11,220
winter's home her objective was to kidnap rose maybe she thought she could control rose easier

1272
05:27:11,220 --> 05:27:16,900
if she looked like her mom when we attacked it put a little damper on her plan so she

1273
05:27:16,900 --> 05:27:23,849
mimicked a corpse but is she the guy that's been lying around remember the guy that i keep saying

1274
05:27:23,930 --> 05:27:32,330
like hey this guy's like in every scene why is he lying down on the ground is that her she then

1275
05:27:32,330 --> 05:27:37,130
revived herself from the transport truck killed everyone on board and took off with rose things

1276
05:27:37,130 --> 05:27:40,490
didn't go the way she had originally planned but in the end she still got what she wanted

1277
05:27:41,369 --> 05:27:47,130
till now it's time to rendezvous and blow this place sky high this might turn into a fight with

1278
05:27:47,130 --> 05:27:53,849
heisenberg but i think i found something useful he left one of his little toys laying around and

1279
05:27:53,849 --> 05:27:59,209
it's even made from a metal polymer composite we can't control time to turn the tables

1280

1282
05:28:35,220 --> 05:28:43,139

05:39:43,099 --> 05:39:51,689
could have infected ethan i forcefully took him and rose with us but the vehicle they were

1332

riding in was attacked when i got to the wreck ethan and rose were gone that's not an ending

1333
05:40:00,540 --> 05:40:06,490
the last time i was able to contact ethan that's not the end of the game i heard miranda's voice

with a sample from the bakers and there's no sign of the genome editing we saw in the e-series

1387

1398
05:55:41,720 --> 05:56:06,419
blame team fortress too okay so if miranda was the fake mia where's the real one

1399
05:56:06,419 --> 05:56:12,889
i doubt she saw any further use for her don't get any of this how did miranda even know rose exists

1400
05:56:13,529 --> 05:56:17,209
a moldy little bird told her maybe we can figure that out later

1401
05:56:17,849 --> 05:56:25,740
focus on the plan i found it it's the megamycete

1402
05:56:27,959 --> 05:56:44,549
crank turtles i killed this the best tigger impression i've located the megamycete

1403
05:56:45,270 --> 05:57:01,209
so now we can end this mess after all about damn time and two explosives armed there's enough

1404
05:57:01,209 --> 05:57:05,610
there to blow the whole village sky high let's get out of here and blow the damn place not before i

1405
05:57:05,610 --> 05:57:17,220
and miranda i'm not taking any more chances i'm going in captain i have eyes on the ceremony site

1406
05:57:17,220 --> 05:57:24,169
keep your distance do not move until i give the order i know it's too late now but we really

1407
05:57:24,169 --> 05:57:29,849
should have told ethan the plan there wasn't time we didn't expect miranda to act so soon

1408
05:57:30,810 --> 05:57:48,459
even so you should have told him yeah and two explosives i guess it was no time

1409
05:57:48,459 --> 05:57:51,819
yeah i think there was time when we were sitting in the garage working as buddies

1410
05:57:52,540 --> 05:58:14,389
on a father-son tractor project i feel like you had a little bit of time to tell me oh here we go

1411
05:58:15,110 --> 05:58:30,840
the final save point before the final boss i know it you know it we all know it this mermaid

1412
05:58:33,110 --> 05:58:42,810
got in it uh subject salvator moro has caused drastic changes to internal organs

1413
05:58:43,369 --> 05:58:48,389
transforming them into organs similar to fish like gills and a swim bladder another subject

1414
05:58:48,389 --> 05:58:52,389
with a regular cell division caused him to transform into giant fish subject is unable

1415
05:58:52,389 --> 05:59:07,139
to control this transformation too many defects an unfit vessel for eva alcenia dimitresu dimitresu

1416
05:59:07,139 --> 05:59:11,819
there it is most favorable brain function normal regeneration rate is incredibly fast

1417
05:59:12,709 --> 05:59:17,099
subject can heal any external wound within seconds and grow her nails into claws in

1418
05:59:17,099 --> 05:59:22,700
mere moments of rapid regeneration also means an increased body size due to hereditary blood

1419
05:59:22,700 --> 05:59:26,459
disease the subject must ingest human flesh and blood on a regular basis to maintain regeneration

1420
05:59:26,459 --> 05:59:31,020
properties i suspect that if the subject's regeneration is not properly balanced then

1421
05:59:31,020 --> 05:59:39,500
she may mutate uncontrollably okay well that's lady dimitresu and then we've got of course

1422
05:59:41,060 --> 05:59:46,970
karl heisenberg has electric organs similar to that of an electric ray

1423
05:59:47,770 --> 05:59:53,419
ponica these electric organs are connected to the subject's nervous system

1424
05:59:54,700 --> 06:00:08,549
oh unfit though try to put the book down and then donna benaviento physically she's no different

1425
06:00:08,549 --> 06:00:13,750
from a regular human however she can secrete a signal producing substance which controls

1426
06:00:13,750 --> 06:00:18,939
plants infected by the mutants site when humans absorb the pollen from a particular flower she

1427
06:00:18,939 --> 06:00:24,970
can cause them to have hallucinations however she is mentally underdeveloped and has had divided

1428
06:00:24,970 --> 06:00:35,610
has divided her kudu among her dolls there we go that's an explanation for all the people

1429
06:00:36,169 --> 06:00:41,799
this is a kudu a dow using this to control the bioweapon

1430
06:00:49,479 --> 06:01:06,040
is that that's miranda that's miranda that's miranda talking to somebody that's heisenberg

1431
06:01:08,229 --> 06:01:12,250
heisenberg and friends dear miranda my deepest apologies for not meeting you in person

1432
06:01:13,779 --> 06:01:17,299
i would love nothing more than to visit your quaint village once more however i'm incredibly

1433
06:01:17,299 --> 06:01:21,459
busy that i can suppose for an immortal woman such as yourself you no longer remember this poor

1434
06:01:21,459 --> 06:01:28,540
half-dead medical student in the snow i've always cherished the revelations i came to 15 years ago

1435
06:01:28,540 --> 06:01:33,659
when i strayed stayed in your village i was inspired by your research to think one could

1436
06:01:33,659 --> 06:01:39,259
transform a human by infecting them with an organism positively visionary i know that with

1437
06:01:39,259 --> 06:01:43,340
that knowledge i could achieve my own vision for the next step in human evolution even after the

1438
06:01:43,340 --> 06:01:48,459
two world wars and humanity on the cusp of another than my conviction never way i stopped putting

1439
06:01:48,459 --> 06:01:54,569
this on i'm like just locked in like a train of thought too much on i realized however through

1440
06:01:55,130 --> 06:01:59,450
the many nights of intellectual talks you and i shared that your conviction differed from mine

1441
06:01:59,450 --> 06:02:05,259
you hope to bring back a single dead person while i aim to change the world your experiments on the

1442
06:02:05,259 --> 06:02:10,860
mold would not have aided me in my endeavor to achieve an exponential infection but a virus

1443
06:02:10,860 --> 06:02:16,380
would be more effective this is why my dear i had to leave you still regret never telling you goodbye

1444
06:02:17,419 --> 06:02:21,099
my apologies for reminiscing i actually have the news that i thought might please you

1445
06:02:22,619 --> 06:02:28,700
i found the key to evolution the progenitor of virus and a virus found in africa i plan

1446
06:02:28,700 --> 06:02:33,020
to start a company with friends and colleagues dedicated to the virus research i would call it

1447
06:02:33,020 --> 06:02:36,779
umbrella just like the symbol in the cave that we spoke about

1448
06:02:37,340 --> 06:02:41,020
i'm one step closer to making my vision a reality i hope you will be able to achieve your goal

1449
06:02:41,020 --> 06:02:48,009
someday too taught me so much of that i would be forever in debt sincerely your lifelong student

1574
06:33:17,849 --> 06:33:21,740
and what about what about duke maybe he'll narrate the ending credits

1575
06:33:22,779 --> 06:33:51,380
you never find out what duke is maybe after the credits i'll get off cam for this this is like a

1576
06:33:51,380 --> 06:34:39,540
very cinematic experience don't eat that don't eat that don't eat that don't eat that uh they

1577
06:34:39,540 --> 06:35:02,380
showed this in the beginning i still kind of don't get it i do but i don't why is she eating all

1578
06:35:02,380 --> 06:35:39,180
these things it's the buffet which one of these is lady dimitri sue gifts we gave but more you took

1579
06:35:39,180 --> 06:35:46,729
she snarled so more in turn is due in a blink the girl was trapped inside a mirror her parents

1580
06:35:46,729 --> 06:35:52,810
though had searched all day and at last arrived with rampant rage father fought the witch

1581
06:35:52,810 --> 06:35:59,270
while mother's loving touch shattered the dark enchantment but the witch was strong and father

1582
06:35:59,270 --> 06:36:04,950
yelled save our daughter so mother bore their child to safety as the forest was consumed

1583
06:36:05,590 --> 06:36:12,500
that didn't happen even now the burnt forest is a grim reminder of father's sacrifice

1584
06:36:13,299 --> 06:36:20,740
to this day any child who stares too long into the charred wasteland will be haunted by nightmares

1585
06:36:20,740 --> 06:36:29,220
of getting lost it's chris the mother no it's chris is not the mother

1586
06:36:35,459 --> 06:36:45,110
all right okay let's turn it down i'll give you my assessment i'll give you my assessment okay

1587
06:36:45,909 --> 06:36:55,220
uh i'm gonna have to say that was that was a started today is an 8.6 the ending brought it

1588
06:36:55,220 --> 06:37:02,659
down to an 8.2 like that just like cod zombies level brought it to like an 8.2 for me i don't i

1589
06:37:02,659 --> 06:37:08,580
i don't think i don't think that's cool i don't i never do um and then when i got to actually be

1590
06:37:08,580 --> 06:37:16,540
use my magnum the way that i wanted to i brought it up to in uh 8.4 and then this really cool

1591
06:37:16,540 --> 06:37:28,889
cinematic in the end kept it at an 8.4 it was that was like a that was great that was a great

1592
06:37:28,889 --> 06:37:42,740
game you stay at an 8.7 or an 8.6 for me if there's a fov slider like what the hell is that

1593
06:37:42,740 --> 06:37:49,299
it's fucking 2021 it's a pc game releasing in 2021 i understand like no but you'll ruin the

1594
06:37:49,299 --> 06:37:57,860
cinematic experience i don't care about that you know what i mean like if the if the zombie that's

1595
06:37:57,860 --> 06:38:02,020
gonna be like three or four pixels forward or something but i'm not gonna throw up playing the

1596
06:38:02,020 --> 06:38:07,619
game i don't like i don't i it's i just want to play the fucking game and not want to throw up

1597
06:38:08,340 --> 06:38:24,459
it was an 8.7 it turned into 8.4 they do that because they they designed the game around

1598
06:38:25,259 --> 06:38:29,099
oh you we don't want you to see shit you're not supposed to see and it has the best experience

1599
06:38:29,099 --> 06:38:38,099
all the scares all the jump scares i i know but it was in the last fucking game in resident evil

1600
06:38:38,099 --> 06:38:42,340
seven though you could it was you could make 90 fov in resident evil seven what happened what's

1601
06:38:42,340 --> 06:38:49,209
the difference it's the same it's literally the sequel to the last game where where where

1602
06:38:51,220 --> 06:39:02,279
anyways now it was really good it was really really fun i like the kind of like treasures

1603
06:39:02,279 --> 06:39:08,200
that they put on the map i thought that was a huge um i thought that was a nice touch it's cool

1604
06:39:08,200 --> 06:39:10,680
they're like well wait what's over there i'm gonna go over there i'm gonna get that treasure

1605
06:39:11,319 --> 06:39:18,279
i did i missed a bunch of shit was it scary that was very scary i think this was scarier than seven

1606
06:39:18,759 --> 06:39:28,180
i buy a lot the first like two hours of seven was really scary really kind of intense but i

1607
06:39:28,180 --> 06:39:33,180
thought this one was like i the the weird baby chapter freaked me the fuck out it really did

1608
06:39:34,810 --> 06:39:40,279
i would say the first two to three hours of resident evil seven was scarier than a majority

1609
06:39:40,279 --> 06:39:45,400
of the shit in this game but i kind of just liked i would play it out in this one a little better

1610
06:39:45,400 --> 06:39:54,950
resident evil seven was like actually like a more creepy scary video game

1611
06:39:55,580 --> 06:40:04,860
resident evil eight is like just like jumpy very jumpy and i guess depending on how you decide

1612
06:40:04,860 --> 06:40:11,750
what you like more as a scary game i guess just more of like a fairy tale yeah i if i would

1613
06:40:11,750 --> 06:40:19,979
choose which game i liked more i don't know man like resident evil seven's last like four or five

1614
06:40:19,979 --> 06:40:28,619
hours i just it was a slog to me that boat sequence in resident evil seven was the ultimate slog and

1615
06:40:28,619 --> 06:40:38,889
it brought the whole fucking game down the whole game came down i did not have i was a little

1616
06:40:38,889 --> 06:40:44,330
irritated in some points in the game but no point in this game did i feel like that boat level

1617
06:40:44,330 --> 06:40:50,819
were you just like shooting machine guns into enemies i mean except for that chris ending

1618
06:40:50,819 --> 06:40:55,540
i think as a whole i think eight's a better game i think seven the first few hours is scarier and

1619
06:40:55,540 --> 06:41:12,279
more interesting but i think eight's probably a better game yeah seven's definitely seven setting

1620
06:41:12,279 --> 06:41:15,720
was probably a little more interesting i don't know just sound about like a weird scary family

1621
06:41:15,720 --> 06:41:20,060
chasing around a house and shit it's like weird and terrifying but then they got rid of that and

1622
06:41:20,060 --> 06:41:28,939
then they moved on to like the boat shit bone in or boneless wings well boneless because i'd like

1623
06:41:28,939 --> 06:41:38,569
to just dunk them in sauce and just drain them what about the heisenberg parking garage segment

1624
06:41:40,790 --> 06:41:46,380
yeah but once i started to feel kind of annoyed and frustrated in that area and how much of that

1625
06:41:46,380 --> 06:41:53,270
is my like adhd inability to pay attention to like certain environments um i still don't think i was

1626
06:41:53,349 --> 06:42:02,180
i really just thought the boat sequence was just terrible so they're both really good games they're

1627
06:42:02,180 --> 06:42:35,659
both like great okay let's see what happens here we have an ending sequence we do do you think the

1628
06:42:35,659 --> 06:42:41,340

1629
06:42:41,340 --> 06:42:50,330
