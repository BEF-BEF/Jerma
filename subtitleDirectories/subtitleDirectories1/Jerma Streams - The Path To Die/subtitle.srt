00:00:01,909 --> 00:00:07,480
This game is called Path to Die. It has two Steam reviews. It came out last week.

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:16,789
I might be running into a another um no no no no once like once every three or four months

3
00:00:16,789 --> 00:00:23,289
there's like a bad stream oh hope not the stream goblin shows up and he's like

4
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:30,170
yes today is the day that i'm going to make the stream suck and he like grabs me but i'm

5
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:42,490
from like the back and pulls me back rips my neck forward oh i see you wanted to play

6
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:45,850
oh space channel five you loved the second one

7
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,570
and he fucking throws his hands out and casts like a bunch of magic spells at me

8
00:00:55,210 --> 00:01:07,000
or sneeze whatever you want all right let's try this one it's called path to die it looks

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,079
like a top-down hotline miami-esque samurai game you control with the right stick i don't

10
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:17,799
know it might be great it might be a little hidden gem it might not even be worth playing

11
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:21,159
but we're going to try welcome to the stream everybody thanks for joining me

12
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:41,879
we may have found a great game i'm okay with that it looks pretty good let me just change

13
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:53,930
this delay on that anymore with this thank you for your patience guys i don't plan on shit

14
00:01:53,930 --> 00:02:04,900
like this happening but sometimes it does here we go let's make sure the options oh this

15
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:10,840

16
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:35,050
so let's see turn it up a little effects graph graphics oh no ambience this looks familiar

17
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:49,860
it came out last week so maybe it looks a little familiar i am interested i'm just gonna

18
00:02:49,860 --> 00:03:06,629
make sure this is loud enough for me okay that's better new game here we go so this is this

19
00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:25,879
is a game where it's a well let's just experience it together brother the clan is

20
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:30,550
under attack they are killing everybody bring your family to the backyard hurry i will keep it

21
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:41,479
clear brother they killed her i couldn't save her now i'm dying too you must save my daughter

22
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:51,189
at least please dad no this takes place and um i don't know monsters you want to kill my

23
00:03:51,189 --> 00:04:03,060
uncle go away but sir no exceptions no she would probably be running if i keep following

24
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:08,340
this path i will die fighting against the clan nagano by myself is something only a madman

25
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:13,750
would do i could run away live my life and die in bed as an old man but if we're going to die

26
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,029
either way i prefer to die with the blood in my hands i'll make them pay for what they did

27
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:28,019
good morning sir currently the entrance tax is 50 mon are you alone the others went to grab

28
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:33,660
something to eat you're really unlucky then with this heat and the blazing sun i think i'm

29
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,100
lucky waiting for them here in the shade i say you are unlucky because now you have to

30
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:46,069
fight me alone young man what why who are you my name is katsu akabashi akabashi you're from that

31
00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:51,029
clan but they said they were no survivors your clan is going to pay for that mistake prepare

32
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:56,379
yourself use the left stick to move around you can hold right trigger to run but this

33
00:04:56,379 --> 00:05:01,589
will consume stamina if you tap your character will dodge to the selected direction avoiding

34
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:09,189
damage except enemy arrows press a to interact with the environment this will allow you to open

35
00:05:09,269 --> 00:05:17,829
doors or pick up objects the hud shows you the amount of health bleed is the amber part stamina

36
00:05:17,829 --> 00:05:28,250
is the white ring katana sharpness is the white blade and arrows you have all right so red

37
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:34,740
circle is just health amber is the bleed stamina is the white ring and then katana

38
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:39,769
sharpness is the blade bleed limits the maximum amount of health you can have and

39
00:05:39,769 --> 00:05:48,500
increases in a small proportion with damage received okay so that's just max health for

40
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:53,060
bleed katana sharpness affects how much damage your attacks inflict being halved with no

41
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:58,389
sharpness okay so that one i'm going to keep that up by pressing right bumper you can lock

42
00:05:58,389 --> 00:06:03,189
on to enemies in combat you can change the target by pressing left stick the katana is

43
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:08,790
your main weapon is used with the right stick by pressing it you will unsheath or sheath your

44
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:13,029
katana with the sword sheath you can draw an attack at the same time only for left and

45
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:21,639
right attacks okay i have to try this with a semi-circle from left to right you'll make a

46
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:29,509
horizontal attack in that direction so you go like bang bang with with one from right to left

47
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:34,939
you the same opposite direction so bang bang with a forward movement you'll make thrust which

48
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:40,199
cannot be stopped by guarding but it is inflicted too much damage moving the stick back and forth

49
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:45,339
make a vertical cut that will break the enemy guard or inflict great damage the vertical cut

50
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:50,629
can be charged when you see a flash until you see a flash upon release it will inflict

51
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:56,740
double damage you can also pivot with left stick the 360 degree slash will help you create

52
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:01,220
space if you see yourself surrounded and will damage all the enemies around you moving the stick

53
00:07:01,779 --> 00:07:05,139
towards the lower left corner and making a semi-circle the character rotates on itself

54
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:16,519
with a sword so you go down and all the way around okay extended what oh all attacks

55
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,879
consume stamina so be careful not to exhaust yourself in front of the enemy also the enemy

56
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:24,439
attacks a similar property so try to avoid guarding against a thrust so how do you guard

57
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:29,579
the yummy is the bow you will use throughout the adventure it can be very powerful

58
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:34,860
I can hear it but the amount of arrows is limited so use them wisely

59
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:43,509
I'm still here to equip the bow hold left bumper you can aim with the left stick to tighten it

60
00:07:43,509 --> 00:07:49,579
and to move the right stick okay hold that bumper you can aim with left stick

61
00:07:49,579 --> 00:07:55,050
to tighten it more move the right stick back and let go to shoot okay I'm gonna just play

62
00:07:55,050 --> 00:08:00,660
around release left bumper to put the away the bow so you hold it pattern to the same

63
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:07,939
with keyboard and mouse I was recommended that I use a controller for this a good defense can

64
00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:12,339
be decisive in any fight by holding left trigger you you'll start defending enemy attacks

65
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:17,220
you can continue moving with the left stick and you can choose the direction to look

66
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:21,620
to with the right stick this will also help so also make you lock on to the closest

67
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:27,860
enemy in that direction while defending your stamina will not recover as fast in their case

68
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:32,980
it's blocking if your stamina runs out your defense will break remember that arrows or thrust

69
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:36,980
cannot be stopped by defending in that blocking vertical cuts will drain a massive amount of

70
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:40,340
stamina don't worry if you can't remember all the attack patterns you can read it all again in

71
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:46,490
the weapon section of your inventory okay you need it now it's time to fight remember draw your

72
00:08:46,490 --> 00:09:24,070
katana what was lock on right bumper okay here we go oh fuck do I don't have any arrows come

73
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:32,220
here fuck come on thrash him oh yeah I can dodge too there's like a dodge roll how good

74
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:41,529
is it how much health is he okay he's dead rest in peace young man the goblins behind

75
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:50,679
me stop stop stop stop stop rest in peace young man this is actually kind of fun it's not bad

76
00:09:50,679 --> 00:10:03,669
there's no turning back now I can run as you can see on your left there are different types

77
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:09,590
of items in the game that represent it as packages red packages are food and recovery

78
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:15,769
health green ones contain drinks to increase maximum stamina temporarily and finally purple

79
00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:20,490
contains bandages to heal bleeding and recover maximum health or wet stones to sharpen your

80
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:27,860
katana those bandages for bleeding and wet stones to sharpen katana not all objects will

81
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,740
have the same effect and some will be more effective than others also you'll find packs

82
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:37,370
of arrows for your bow or keys that allow you to open new areas get that mouse off the screen

83
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:41,210
the number of packages you can carry is limited to five for each item and 15 for

84
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:45,769
the arrows use them wisely navigate with the d-pad through your inventory press x to use the

85
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:55,399
selected object did I mute the music no I didn't you can also see a small table with a

86
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,950
brush ink and paper on it this is a save point and there are many more throughout your adventure

87
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:04,870
it is very important that every time you see one save your progress on it or you could lose

88
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:14,230
your valuable time since there are no checkpoints in the game be careful god damn it that's right

181
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:13,420
that is the private gardens of hotaru nagano one of the sons of the feudal lord really is

182
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:18,139
there some way to meet this person that's not possible he is an eccentric man who rarely

183
00:35:18,139 --> 00:35:22,059
leaves his house inside of the gardens even for most of us who work there would be

184
00:35:22,059 --> 00:35:28,300
difficult so you work there could you let me in the next time what do you want to get us

185
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:32,380
killed listen you don't know these people they don't like outsiders and they are ruthless a lot

186
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,579
of people came to this village because they lost their homes in the war and came here seeking

187
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:41,349
protection and we have it but they treat us like dogs we work all day for them and they

188
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:45,110
barely give us enough food to survive particularly the captain of the guard is

189
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:52,250
really rotten they even arrested my daughter for confronting him she's just a kid I don't even

190
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:55,849
know if I will see her again I'm not gonna do anything that could harm her we shouldn't

191
00:35:55,849 --> 00:36:04,469

192
00:36:05,269 --> 00:36:11,559

343
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:57,399
i'm just kidding how am i supposed to all right here's my one gripe that i have with

344
01:09:57,399 --> 01:10:06,250
the game so there's a mechanic where you the weapon dulls so you could be walking around

345
01:10:06,250 --> 01:10:16,039
with a useless weapon but are there any other weapons to use because what happens if i just

346
01:10:16,039 --> 01:10:23,020
don't if i don't find a whetstone here is just i just lose i have to hit the people

347
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:54,920
two or three times as many times zero sharpness is 50 less damage that sucks i wouldn't call

348
01:10:54,920 --> 01:11:01,979
it a soft lock i would just i mean it's hard to handle i don't know block she went

349
01:11:01,979 --> 01:11:12,600
through that oh man all right am i playing anything else yeah i'm gonna just play picked

350
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:20,539
up picks and we're just gonna chill it's a thrust yeah i have to like dodge the thrust

351
01:11:21,260 --> 01:11:38,279
because i really am just screwed i need health i need my weapon is dull i need to shoot that

352
01:11:38,279 --> 01:11:41,779
person with arrows that's so much easier because i don't think she can i don't think

353
01:11:41,779 --> 01:11:53,770
they can block it oh my god she can dodge it though very easily and here comes the whole

354
01:11:53,770 --> 01:12:15,619
zone all right i'll be right back we're gonna reboot we're gonna reboot the stream here i'm
