1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:06,700
You guys, how are you? What's up? How are you doing?

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,689
Hi. Yeah, sorry I'm late. Yeah, yeah I know.

3
00:00:09,689 --> 00:00:16,309
For those of you that were not in the pre-stream chat, and the reason why I am late,

4
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:22,969
I got an emergency phone call. Uh, nothing weird happened.

5
00:00:22,969 --> 00:00:26,649
Nothing out of the ordinary. I had an emergency call.

6
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:35,399
I had to take it. And it was, uh, you know, I just had to make sure I took the call.

7
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:38,200
And it was important about, um, financial stuff.

8
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,200
And I went to make sure I got my financial stuff in order.

9
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,280
And, um, a few things about, like, a recipe that I needed for my mother.

10
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,920
Um, said nothing weird happened or anything, but sorry about that.

11
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:55,429
Yeah, I mean, it's like tax season and shit.

12
00:00:55,429 --> 00:00:57,509
Like, I'm just trying to make sure I, like, I, you know,

13
00:00:57,509 --> 00:01:00,149
cross all my t's and dot on my i's. You know what I'm saying?

14
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:07,030
I absolutely did not do something incredibly disgusting and embarrassing.

15
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,349
Well, yuck. Why would that happen?

16
00:01:09,349 --> 00:01:13,510
Like, clog your toilet with your massive pastrami sandwich shit you had yesterday.

17
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,829
No way. Not, that didn't happen at all.

18
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:18,390
But frankly, it's revolting that you're saying it.

19
00:01:23,739 --> 00:01:26,620
Like, why would that happen? Like, you guys are disgusting.

20
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,739
Do you see what people are writing?

21
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:33,260
Look, those are the that joined us after pre-stream chat.

22
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,780
Look at, look at how fucked up this community is.

23
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:39,819
I didn't, what is, what are they talking about?

24
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,340
Oh, look, Jerma the serial killer. Here we go again, right?

25
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:47,560
I'm so sick of this. Whatever.

26
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,230
Oh, how you doing?

27
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,709
Hope you had a good Christmas. Merry Christmas if I didn't see you.

28
00:01:57,349 --> 00:01:59,430
I did see you, though. The day before Christmas.

29
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,340
Uh, I, I had a great Christmas. It was good.

30
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,629
I got a new wallet. It's nice.

31
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:15,219
I got some bath stuff because I'm a big bath guy, you know me.

32
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:23,560
Hey, thank you, Santa, for the five community subs.

33
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,539
Wham, wham, wham, deal with it, entertainer.

34
00:02:29,539 --> 00:02:35,849
This is a boring title. What the hell?

35
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:41,819
We peeped the toilet. No, you can't.

36
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:47,460
Boring title. I don't even know what the game is.

37
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,300
I just, everyone told me to play it.

38
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,789
It looks cool. It's got buying and trading.

39
00:02:52,789 --> 00:02:53,830
So, you know, I'm going to like it.

40
00:02:54,389 --> 00:02:57,800
It was, it was Satan. Oh, thank you, Satan.

41
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:08,020
Yeah, this is, this is called Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator.

42
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:11,159
It's a game where you fly around the galaxy

43
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,080
and you buy and sell organs of aliens.

44
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,060
I, it was recommended a bunch of times.

45
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,580
Like I said, I am ready.

46
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:23,659
I am ready to give it a try.

47
00:03:25,659 --> 00:03:26,460
Question is, are you?

48
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:38,939
All right, so let me turn this up just a tad with my microphone here.

49
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:49,379
You ever played Rimworld?

50
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:50,819
No, it's too complicated for me.

51
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Looks like a fun game. Too complicated for my brain.

52
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:02,379
Is that better? Can you guys hear me better now?

53
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:04,460
All right, I'm going to do some tests for you.

54
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,180
So you tell me if this is too much or too little.

55
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:14,599
Ready?

56
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,600
Too loud? You want more?

57
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:29,370
Better? How's this? Is this better?

58
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:34,170
Is this one good? What if I scream though?

59
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,529
Like, okay, I'm going to turn it down.

60
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:43,990
Better? Trying to get my audio settings better.

61
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:49,129
More? Is that better? Perfect.

62
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,790
All right, let's see. Let's just go.

63
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,339
Sounds good. Okay.

64
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,620
Maybe do a little more. We'll see.

65
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:04,759
Well, this is organ trader simulator.

66
00:05:08,019 --> 00:05:08,899
I'm very curious.

67
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,129
Was my FPS weird?

68
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:23,579
Wait, what? What do you mean 23 Hertz?

69
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:28,300
Is this a fucking CRT TV on an iMac from like 1995?

70
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,139
Why does it look like this?

71
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,389
What's happening? Hold on.

72
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:41,100
This is weird. How can you even do 23 Hertz?

73
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,860
That's crazy. It's because it's cinematic.

74
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:49,910
Oh, I see. All right.

75
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:52,310
144 Hertz at 1440p.

76
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:56,500
I actually hate selecting this.

77
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,899
I am one of those old boomer people that really does.

78
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:03,860
I like 1080p. I don't want any.

79
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,860
I don't want 1440p. I don't want 2560.

80
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,500
It's too high.

81
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,899
Text effect? Wiggle?

82
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:15,220
No, I don't make the Alpuc.

83
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:17,300
Music's all right.

84
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:18,740
All right, I'm going to apply.

85
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,939
Hopefully the stream isn't crashed.

86
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:22,970
Oh, look at how much better that is.

87
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:28,040
No wiggle? No, no, no wiggling.

88
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,720
No, I don't like when shit moves around.

89
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:31,579
Was this full screen?

90
00:06:32,649 --> 00:06:33,370
Okay, that's fine.

91
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,050
Are you ready?

92
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,639
I'm not turning the wiggle on.

93
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:40,060
The wiggle's not going on.

94
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:43,290
Set the stream to 1080.

95
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,220
We're going to go.

96
00:06:50,019 --> 00:06:54,139
I'm very curious about this game for you guys.

97
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:54,540
There you are.

98
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:57,529
Uh, thank you.

99
00:06:57,529 --> 00:07:00,170
Thanks to usually Zane MysticQuests

100
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:03,529
and anonymousgifter for the five, five, ten, five community subs.

101
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:05,319
All right, I'm ready. Let's go.

102
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,730
Great new game.

103
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,410
Who are you?

104
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:11,529
Dog. No.

105
00:07:12,329 --> 00:07:13,209
Dog with a hat on.

106
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:19,139
Wait, what the fuck?

107
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:25,509
All right, a, uh, the mage from Final Fantasy.

108
00:07:27,209 --> 00:07:27,529
Sus.

109
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,660
Frog.

110
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:30,699
Frog.

111
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:35,500
The guy from that Netflix show with like the super powered people.

112
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,540
They live in a mansion together.

113
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,290
Explosion guy.

114
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:41,319
Double Knight.

115
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:45,259
The new ice cube thing that people do on Twitch right now.

116
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:48,810
Spider-Man.

117
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,240
Peter Parker.

118
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,899
This guy.

119
00:07:53,899 --> 00:08:03,579
I don't think you understand your position.

120
00:08:03,579 --> 00:08:05,019
I cannot touch you.

121
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:10,040
You are an organ trader, a supplier of meaty demand

122
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:15,019
with a moral flexibility ranging in the parsecs.

123
00:08:15,019 --> 00:08:20,069
You buy organs, you sell organs, you take on client requests

124
00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:24,149
and fulfill them and use their money to fuel your future.

125
00:08:24,149 --> 00:08:24,629
Why is it?

126
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:25,829
This person's talking like me.

127
00:08:25,829 --> 00:08:27,189
I type like this.

128
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:32,070
This is how I talk in chat.

129
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:36,549
You buy, you fulfill them and use their money to fuel your future.

130
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,279
I don't know.

131
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:39,960
I like emphasizing words.

132
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:47,129
You will not lose money fulfilling a request unless you want to.

133
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:50,899
You cannot be held accountable for your actions.

134
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:52,100
Everyone has organs.

135
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,860
Everyone wants organs and everyone needs organs.

136
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,120
Which means they need you.

137
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,379
This is an angry YouTube comment.

138
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,799
They need us.

139
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,320
So congratulations.

140
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,980
The universe is your fleshy parasitic playground.

141
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,940
Everyone else just lives in it.

142
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:18,580
Can you stall?

143
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,500
What do you mean can I stall?

144
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,440
It's 4 30.

145
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,600
I was supposed to start a half an hour ago.

146
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,240
Don't worry.

147
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,919
You can, you don't have to turn laundry over.

148
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:32,840
You can leave the laundry in the washing machine for at least like 30 to 40 minutes.

149
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:35,320
Anything over an hour or two, that's bad.

150
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,519
You're going to have to rewash.

151
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:37,000
Just saying.

152
00:09:41,139 --> 00:09:42,659
Scroll and then left and right.

153
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:44,120
Okay.

154
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:46,629
Oh, shit.

155
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:46,950
Okay.

156
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:47,269
How much?

157
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:48,710
I have 2,300 bucks.

158
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,269
Type, size, trade.

159
00:09:52,309 --> 00:09:53,799
So I got this.

160
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:56,039
Cargo and holds.

161
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,059
Personal.

162
00:09:59,059 --> 00:09:59,379
Holds.

163
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:00,019
I like to click.

164
00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:00,500
I'm slow.

165
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:01,720
Okay.

166
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,360
Q and E.

167
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:02,759
I don't like it.

168
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:03,159
It's too fast.

169
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:04,120
I feel like I'm playing StarCraft.

170
00:10:05,419 --> 00:10:05,659
Okay.

171
00:10:05,659 --> 00:10:06,379
So holds.

172
00:10:06,379 --> 00:10:07,179
Where am I?

173
00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:08,139
What's my favorite organ?

174
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,240
The spleen.

175
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,980
So day zero.

176
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:15,460
Personal.

177
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:17,110
Title.

178
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:17,990
Scum.

179
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:18,710
Current face.

180
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:19,350
This.

181
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,230
2,300 credits.

182
00:10:20,789 --> 00:10:22,090
Reputation progression.

183
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,129
Reputation credits.

184
00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:24,009
Stock portfolio.

185
00:10:24,009 --> 00:10:26,139
So you trade stocks.

186
00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:27,500
Organs touched.

187
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,799
Intestines owned in meters.

188
00:10:31,429 --> 00:10:32,389
Breaths taken.

189
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:33,590
What the fuck is this?

190
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:35,450
All right.

191
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:39,529
So this is just like my personal little card here.

192
00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:42,940
So this is what I'm hold, holds.

193
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:44,860
Refer.

194
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,340
Oh, okay.

195
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,379
So I can upgrade my shit.

196
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,330
Close decay of all organs by 25%.

197
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:51,610
Oh, I'm going to be into this game.

198
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:51,929
Let's see.

199
00:10:51,929 --> 00:10:52,169
Wait.

200
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,830
A cargo.

201
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:56,490
Okay.

202
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,519
I only have what?

203
00:10:58,519 --> 00:10:59,159
Five slots?

204
00:10:59,159 --> 00:10:59,720
Six slots?

205
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,299
Don't breathe for two minutes and see what happens.

206
00:11:02,299 --> 00:11:04,460
Don't ever fucking don't breathe for two minutes.

207
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:04,860
Breathe.

208
00:11:05,419 --> 00:11:07,799
Don't play these dumb games.

209
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:08,039
No.

210
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:09,720
Refill.

211
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,460
Audio log?

212
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,340
Is this a guitar?

213
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:18,940
What does a guitar want with an organ?

214
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:23,100
Or is this just the annoying guy that I call that plays this first and then says hello?

215
00:11:23,659 --> 00:11:29,769
Okay.

216
00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:30,409
Here we go.

217
00:11:30,409 --> 00:11:30,889
Refill.

218
00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:31,129
All right.

219
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:31,929
What about trade?

220
00:11:31,929 --> 00:11:32,649
Can I trade?

221
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:33,690
How do I know what people want?

222
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,070
Can I go trade?

223
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:36,629
Trade.

224
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:37,509
The market is open.

225
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:38,070
What?

226
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,350
What do you mean the market's open?

227
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:39,590
Buy?

228
00:11:40,549 --> 00:11:41,399
What is this?

229
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,539
This is a liver.

230
00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:44,340
It's a large liver.

231
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,100
It's in a 46 blood type B+.

232
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:46,659
What do people...

233
00:11:46,659 --> 00:11:46,980
Wait, wait.

234
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:47,460
Request.

235
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,139
Hello, scum.

236
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:52,409
Hello.

237
00:11:52,409 --> 00:11:53,450
Right now you're nothing.

238
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:56,009
They wouldn't trust you to trade shoes and we're going to fix that.

239
00:11:56,009 --> 00:11:57,769
Get me a stomach and make something in yourself.

240
00:11:58,649 --> 00:11:59,610
I only have two minutes.

241
00:11:59,610 --> 00:11:59,769
All right.

242
00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:00,490
I'll get your stomach.

243
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:02,870
I a stomach.

244
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,179
This is a heart.

245
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:06,389
Liver.

246
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:07,769
Heart.

247
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:08,809
Heart.

248
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,009
Liver.

249
00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:10,970
There are no stomachs.

250
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:13,830
Stomach.

251
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:14,070
All right.

252
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:14,870
Blood type AB.

253
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:15,590
Rarity mythic.

254
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:17,909
Natural, neutral flesh.

255
00:12:17,909 --> 00:12:18,870
No special traits.

256
00:12:19,429 --> 00:12:21,690
Can I filter stomachs?

257
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,779
This one's cheap.

258
00:12:26,419 --> 00:12:27,620
Rarity rough.

259
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,820
Rarity rare.

260
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,460
150.

261
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:31,110
I'm going to buy this.

262
00:12:31,669 --> 00:12:32,490
Okay.

263
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:32,889
Request.

264
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:35,500
Where are you?

265
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:35,820
Fulfill.

266
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,700
Hey, I got you.

267
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,100
I got it.

268
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:39,779
Reputation descended.

269
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:40,100
Trash.

270
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,019
What do you mean?

271
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:42,500
What?

272
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,460
New organs on log.

273
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:43,860
What did I do?

274
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:45,860
Breaking the...

275
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,019
Wait.

276
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:46,419
What do you want?

277
00:12:46,419 --> 00:12:47,700
This guy's got $5,000.

278
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:51,399
Want cold companions.

279
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,720
In high gravity on cold nights,

280
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,960
I like to clutch a warm lung between my fingers.

281
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,320
I need another one for a friend.

282
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:57,559
All right.

283
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:58,840
You want a warm lung?

284
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,320
What do you want?

285
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,320
I need an eyeball.

286
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:02,809
Okay.

287
00:13:02,809 --> 00:13:04,009
Lung and eyeball.

288
00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:05,450
There's too many people that want stuff.

289
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:06,490
All right.

290
00:13:07,129 --> 00:13:08,009
Can I filter?

291
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,549
This is $4,300.

292
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,820
I don't have that kind of money.

293
00:13:14,539 --> 00:13:15,879
I know I've done that.

294
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:20,730
$4,300 eyeball right here.

295
00:13:21,289 --> 00:13:22,090
This one's common.

296
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:22,889
Buy it.

297
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:25,259
I don't have enough to buy.

298
00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:28,759
Oh, right here, right here.

299
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:29,799
B plus rarity rough.

300
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,320
Just buy it.

301
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,029
How much are you going to give me for this?

302
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:37,659
Oh my God.

303
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:38,460
It was a lot of money.

304
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:38,700
Okay.

305
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:38,940
Yeah.

306
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:39,899
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

307
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:40,460
Fulfill, fulfill.

308
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:40,940
Holy shit.

309
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:41,100
Yeah.

310
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:41,419
I got it.

311
00:13:41,419 --> 00:13:41,740
I get it.

312
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,500
That's how much they want to give you.

313
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:43,820
All right.

314
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,340
Uh, what do you want?

315
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:52,840
Three more.

316
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,559
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

317
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:54,120
I want a heart.

318
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,639
Now give me a heart above 74.

319
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:56,360
I got 10 seconds.

320
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,100
Oh, I got it.

321
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:05,340
What?

322
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:10,809
What the hell?

323
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,259
I got scammed?

324
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:15,210
You got to go quick.

325
00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:17,620
Okay.

326
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,100
What about...

327
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,659
This is day one.

328
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:23,139
Do I have any?

329
00:14:23,139 --> 00:14:23,860
Oh, I don't have to.

330
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,980
I don't have to sell it immediately.

331
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:25,700
I can just buy it.

332
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,740
The condition was wrong.

333
00:14:30,889 --> 00:14:31,450
Oh, okay.

334
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:33,929
So my reputation enabled eternal war effort.

335
00:14:33,929 --> 00:14:34,090
What?

336
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:38,419
It was 90 though.

337
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:38,820
Yeah.

338
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,460
I thought it was high.

339
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:41,299
You scammed them.

340
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:46,759
I did?

341
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,080
My reputation is going kind of high.

342
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:50,549
All right.

343
00:14:50,549 --> 00:14:52,070
Listen, this is kind of cool.

344
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,669
All right, all right, all right, all right.

345
00:14:53,669 --> 00:14:56,389
So can I do anything else with money?

346
00:14:56,389 --> 00:14:57,590
I just have to buy a bunch of shit.

347
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:01,590
Can I, can I filter or do I have to actually scroll?

348
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,450
It was...

349
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:05,980
Oh, you only got two minutes of too much pressure.

350
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:11,370
High reputation, you trash.

351
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,009
It won't be for long.

352
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:14,309
You just have to scroll.

353
00:15:14,309 --> 00:15:14,629
All right.

354
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:18,899
25 gram.

355
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:19,940
What does this get me?

356
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:23,110
A refrigeration unit welded onto the space.

357
00:15:23,669 --> 00:15:26,070
A cargo hold should occupy and miraculously it works.

358
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,549
You don't have to do requests.

359
00:15:28,549 --> 00:15:30,409
Really?

360
00:15:30,409 --> 00:15:32,409
I'm gonna go for it again.

361
00:15:32,409 --> 00:15:32,809
Let's go.

362
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:33,769
Rating.

363
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:35,399
Argo.

364
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:36,440
Bye.

365
00:15:39,049 --> 00:15:39,370
All right.

366
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:39,850
What's...

367
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:40,409
How can I see the...

368
00:15:42,169 --> 00:15:44,649
Warlord Orbis always wants to greet new traders.

369
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:46,250
With a gift.

370
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,169
Says it helps grease the wheels for everyone.

371
00:15:48,169 --> 00:15:50,090
Would a mythic heart be useful?

372
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:54,970
Uh, yeah.

373
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:00,220
Can I sell it?

374
00:16:03,139 --> 00:16:03,460
All right.

375
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:06,500
Small, condition 68, blood type zero.

376
00:16:07,059 --> 00:16:07,460
Mythic.

377
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:11,299
I can sell this for 2,500 bucks right now.

378
00:16:11,299 --> 00:16:12,259
No, I'm holding it.

379
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,860
All right, all right, all right, all right.

380
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,500
What do people want?

381
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:15,940
What do you want?

382
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:17,929
You want a...

383
00:16:17,929 --> 00:16:18,570
I want a stomach.

384
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,490
I don't think about the thunder of the war harvesters or the...

385
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:21,129
I just want a stomach.

386
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:21,850
All right, you want a stomach?

387
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:22,730
I'll get you a cheap stomach.

388
00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:24,460
Stomach.

389
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,950
It's a liver.

390
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:27,350
Stomach.

391
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,190
How much was he going to pay me?

392
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:29,750
I don't remember.

393
00:16:30,549 --> 00:16:33,879
Stomach.

394
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:35,480
How much was he going to get?

395
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,120
Is this a bad idea?

396
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:38,919
Yeah, okay.

397
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:39,320
Got it.

398
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:43,740
Wait, what?

399
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:44,860
What happened?

400
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,419
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

401
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:45,980
Oh, fulfill.

402
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:46,220
Shit.

403
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:48,539
Wait, what do you want?

404
00:16:48,539 --> 00:16:50,259
I need an eyeball.

405
00:16:50,899 --> 00:16:51,460
Filled that.

406
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:54,340
I'm holding this.

407
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,419
I'm not selling this yet.

408
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,500
Uh, okay, wait, wait, wait.

409
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,620
You're going to be a thousand bucks for...

410
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,179
That's a warm heart.

411
00:17:02,179 --> 00:17:02,820
I want a heart.

412
00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:04,099
You're not getting the one that's in here.

413
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:04,900
So I got to buy something cheap.

414
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:05,460
Warm heart.

415
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:06,980
No.

416
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:10,150
No, eyeball.

417
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:13,109
What the fuck?

418
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:16,069
These are so expensive.

419
00:17:16,789 --> 00:17:17,589
This one's not bad.

420
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:19,079
All right, bye.

421
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:20,759
This is going to be a thousand bucks.

422
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,019
I made a hundred dollars on that.

423
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,700
Made a couple hundred dollars on that.

424
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:30,380
Can I see the chart on this?

425
00:17:31,099 --> 00:17:32,059
I want to see the chart.

426
00:17:33,579 --> 00:17:35,900
Maybe do I unlock a chart?

427
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,940
The dev is in the chat.

428
00:17:37,819 --> 00:17:38,460
Going on, dev.

429
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,599
I can do another quest.

430
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:44,710
200, do you want me to give a...

431
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:45,750
200, do you want me to give a...

432
00:17:47,589 --> 00:17:48,789
You need to give me a stomach.

433
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:50,390
For 200 bucks, bro.

434
00:17:53,109 --> 00:17:54,869
No, I need a cheap stomach.

435
00:17:54,869 --> 00:17:55,369
There we go.

436
00:17:59,769 --> 00:18:00,809
Oh, I got...

437
00:18:00,809 --> 00:18:01,450
I ascended.

438
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:02,089
I'm dubious.

439
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:04,650
New organs unlocked.

440
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,579
The dev in chat said you have to put a face cam on.

441
00:18:07,579 --> 00:18:08,779
I don't have any clothes on, so I can't.

442
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,619
Maybe I should just buy something.

443
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:14,180
Rarity, rough, rarity, common, condition.

444
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,380
This is in such bad condition.

445
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,099
Should I buy something?

446
00:18:18,339 --> 00:18:18,839
Um...

447
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:20,680
Ooh.

448
00:18:23,509 --> 00:18:24,009
All right.

449
00:18:25,109 --> 00:18:26,299
What's wrong?

450
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:31,500
All right, where will my car go?

451
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,569
This thing was worth...

452
00:18:34,569 --> 00:18:35,930
I lost a little bit on this.

453
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:36,890
Why is that an excuse?

454
00:18:37,529 --> 00:18:38,809
I don't have clothes on.

455
00:18:39,609 --> 00:18:40,890
I'm not going to stream naked.

456
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:45,900
All right, I leveled up.

457
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,039
Now I know why it's Q and E.

458
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,319
Because this is a game where you have to go very fast.

459
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:54,319
Oh god, this is going to be fucking horrible.

460
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:59,130
We won't tell Twitch.

461
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:01,740
No.

462
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,940
By the way, I just want to make sure everyone's aware.

463
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:09,150
The New Year's Eve voting is open.

464
00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:10,970
I'm going to give you a link.

465
00:19:15,609 --> 00:19:18,170
You can now go vote if you haven't already.

466
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:21,519
I'm going to paste it.

467
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:23,519
Actually, I think some of the mods probably have it already, but...

468
00:19:24,619 --> 00:19:25,119
Let's see.

469
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:28,000
It is.

470
00:19:28,859 --> 00:19:29,579
I'll get it to you.

471
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:34,220
This is going to take you a while, potentially, just to let you know.

472
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:43,519
There are 26 categories this year.

473
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:49,119
Now make sure you take a lot of time to understand and figure out which one of your favorite errands

474
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,890
of the year it was.

475
00:19:51,849 --> 00:19:54,170
There were so many best and worst noises.

476
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:56,720
We...

477
00:19:57,099 --> 00:19:58,059
You guys don't understand.

478
00:19:59,019 --> 00:20:02,220
The noise categories had to get split up into four plus.

479
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,740
I think three or four of different categories.

480
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,279
And then they had to get whittled down.

481
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:10,920
There were like hundreds of best and worst noise nominees.

482
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,420
Hundreds.

483
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:14,019
Too many.

484
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,640
Yeah, there is worst beater as well.

485
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,920
I don't know. I just felt like putting it there.

486
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,359
I didn't think anyone was going to nominate anything.

487
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:22,079
I thought it would be funny.

488
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,049
Oh yeah.

489
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:26,490
That's going to close in a few days.

490
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:28,009
You only have like four days to do that.

491
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:30,200
You do want to participate.

492
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,240
That's only going to be open until probably the 30th at midnight, I would assume.

493
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:35,849
Are you naked?

494
00:20:35,849 --> 00:20:36,809
I am comfortable.

495
00:20:39,069 --> 00:20:40,109
You say naked.

496
00:20:40,109 --> 00:20:40,990
I say comfortable.

497
00:20:41,849 --> 00:20:42,490
Is there a problem?

498
00:20:43,289 --> 00:20:45,559
All right, let's go.

499
00:20:51,289 --> 00:20:53,130
I feel like I'm getting the hang of this.

500
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:53,630
Traders.

501
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,039
BribeMate has been installed.

502
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,640
You can now buy, favor, and earn reputation from fellow traders,

503
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,039
as well as pay them to stop trading for a day.

504
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:03,539
What?

505
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:07,690
I can pay other traders to stop trading?

506
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:09,920
What's this?

507
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:14,970
Name the quartermaster.

508
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:17,930
Goal brains, hearts, and lungs.

509
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,640
Resupplies the scant human colonies.

510
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,480
Focuses on the bare essentials, just in case.

511
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:27,130
So this guy's buying all the brains, hearts, and lungs.

512
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:28,170
So I can get rid of this guy.

513
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:35,079
Favor.

514
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:35,480
So what?

515
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,000
I get reputation with this guy.

516
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,069
Or I can just say don't trade tomorrow.

517
00:21:43,339 --> 00:21:44,779
I'm not comfortable with that yet.

518
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:50,160
I don't have enough money to make these like weird moves.

519
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,599
All right.

520
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:55,099
What do I got?

521
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:56,970
I still got this.

522
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,839
Do I have any orders to fulfill?

523
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:00,160
I don't.

524
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:00,640
All right. I'm ready.

525
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,140
Let's go.

526
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,380
Turn it on.

527
00:22:07,069 --> 00:22:07,470
Yo.

528
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:07,970
What?

529
00:22:08,349 --> 00:22:08,849
What?

530
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:10,589
All right.

531
00:22:10,589 --> 00:22:11,089
What do you got?

532
00:22:11,549 --> 00:22:12,029
Holy shit.

533
00:22:12,029 --> 00:22:12,529
What do you need?

534
00:22:13,069 --> 00:22:14,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

535
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,180
You know this.

536
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,160
Lung replacement.

537
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,519
See, could you get a lungs?

538
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:29,849
I need a good lung and eyeball, lung, and eyeball.

539
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,930
Two eyes and lungs.

540
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:33,640
What's this thing?

541
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:35,980
Hey, hey, hey.

542
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:37,500
Oh, he's buying shit.

543
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:37,740
All right.

544
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,940
I need lungs, lungs, lungs, lungs, lungs.

545
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,339
What is this?

546
00:22:39,339 --> 00:22:39,839
Antlers?

547
00:22:40,619 --> 00:22:42,130
Eyeball?

548
00:22:42,589 --> 00:22:45,019
This guy's taking all my shit.

549
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,160
Lungs.

550
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,269
3,000.

551
00:22:48,269 --> 00:22:48,670
No, no, no.

552
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:49,170
2,100.

553
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,819
No, no, no.

554
00:22:51,819 --> 00:22:52,359
I need the eyeball.

555
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:52,859
Eyeball.

556
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:55,150
This is an eye?

557
00:22:55,769 --> 00:22:56,569
It's a soul?

558
00:22:56,569 --> 00:22:57,690
What? You can trade souls?

559
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,990
I need another eyeball.

560
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:04,930
Nice.

561
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,319
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

562
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,259
Oh, my God.

563
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:12,700
This is rare and it's worth a lot of money.

564
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:13,920
I got it.

565
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,700
We got.

566
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:18,640
Holy shit.

567
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,279
I don't even know.

568
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:20,160
I don't even know what they want.

569
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,359
Just take it before the other guy does.

570
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:22,579
What do you want?

571
00:23:24,089 --> 00:23:24,970
A new soul.

572
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:29,200
You want lungs?

573
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:32,680
Soul, lung, lung.

574
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:34,599
Soul, lung, lung.

575
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:35,640
Soul, lung, lung.

576
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:36,700
Soul?

577
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:39,730
Soul?

578
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:46,259
Soul?

579
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,519
You dick.

580
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:50,920
This is too expensive.

581
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:51,960
I'm buying.

582
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,440
This is cheap.

583
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:52,940
I don't care.

584
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,039
Soul, lung, lung.

585
00:23:58,039 --> 00:23:58,680
Make a mint.

586
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,269
Learn the secrets of the galaxy's top organ trainers.

587
00:24:02,269 --> 00:24:03,630
Read organ barcodes.

588
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:05,869
All for the low, low price of $730.

589
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:09,039
Read organ barcodes?

590
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:15,200
What does it do?

591
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:18,430
Soul.

592
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:18,930
Got it.

593
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:19,950
I need two lungs.

594
00:24:20,509 --> 00:24:20,829
Cheap.

595
00:24:20,829 --> 00:24:21,710
I need cheap lungs.

596
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:22,670
How expensive?

597
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:23,170
Cheap.

598
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:29,640
That one's good.

599
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:29,960
That one's good.

600
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,519
That one's fine, fine, fine.

601
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:31,480
Get that one.

602
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:36,029
Oh, bingo.

603
00:24:36,029 --> 00:24:36,829
Look at this.

604
00:24:36,829 --> 00:24:37,329
Hell yeah.

605
00:24:38,029 --> 00:24:40,349
$4,300 for what?

606
00:24:40,349 --> 00:24:41,869
$4,400 for what?

607
00:24:41,869 --> 00:24:42,910
I only have 10 seconds.

608
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:43,630
I don't even know what he wants.

609
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:48,599
Delete it.

610
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:49,160
I don't want it.

611
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:49,960
Before they get mad at me.

612
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:51,500
All right.

613
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,059
That was a good day.

614
00:24:52,779 --> 00:24:58,109
Buy cheap balls.

615
00:24:58,109 --> 00:25:06,640
Your heart's worthless?

616
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,420
Okay, what?

617
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,460
It's mythic though.

618
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,319
Exemplary flesh.

619
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:14,119
Inspirational.

620
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:15,960
Improves condition of nearby...

621
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,930
Wait a minute.

622
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:20,430
What?

623
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:24,509
Improves condition of nearby organs.

624
00:25:24,509 --> 00:25:29,079
It does?

625
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:31,740
Blood type condition 49.

626
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:35,289
The heart will...

627
00:25:35,289 --> 00:25:35,930
Sell the heart.

628
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,369
The condition gets worse over time.

629
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:37,930
Oh, shit.

630
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:38,430
Okay.

631
00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:42,170
So these just drop in...

632
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:42,490
All right.

633
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:43,930
I bought this for 70 bucks.

634
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:46,799
I like this.

635
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,809
This is fun.

636
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:52,400
Mark it.

637
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:52,900
Oh.

638
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,799
Oh, boy.

639
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:55,299
Oh, boy.

640
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:56,750
Okay.

641
00:25:57,369 --> 00:25:59,450
The heart index?

642
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,079
Mark it in for X-Cormix.

643
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:08,519
Liver index.

644
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:10,890
Lungs.

645
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:12,009
The brain index is pretty...

646
00:26:12,009 --> 00:26:13,529
The brains are doing pretty good.

647
00:26:13,529 --> 00:26:14,569
Expensive.

648
00:26:14,569 --> 00:26:19,849
Wait, I can...

649
00:26:19,849 --> 00:26:20,920
Wait.

650
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,640
Hold on a minute.

651
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,359
I can buy...

652
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,599
These are like ETFs.

653
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:27,980
These are organ ETFs.

654
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:33,019
So I can just buy essentially a weighted index of the hearts.

655
00:26:33,579 --> 00:26:39,559
I don't have to buy hearts.

656
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:40,059
Okay.

657
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,720
Because I can buy stock.

658
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,119
Yes, this is an ETF.

659
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,230
All right.

660
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,029
What's cheap right now?

661
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:50,619
Eyeballs.

662
00:26:56,269 --> 00:26:56,910
Uh, okay.

663
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:57,230
Hold on.

664
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:57,470
Let me...

665
00:26:58,109 --> 00:26:59,309
This is a lot.

666
00:26:59,309 --> 00:26:59,789
All right.

667
00:26:59,789 --> 00:27:01,150
Nothing looks like it's down or anything.

668
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:02,690
Yeah.

669
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:03,730
I'm not going to buy any of this shit.

670
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,589
What do you got?

671
00:27:06,589 --> 00:27:07,150
What's wrong with you?

672
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:10,589
Okay.

673
00:27:10,589 --> 00:27:10,670
Yeah.

674
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:11,869
If you don't know what an ETF is.

675
00:27:11,869 --> 00:27:13,069
So an ETF is...

676
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:15,789
And it's called an exchange traded fund.

677
00:27:15,789 --> 00:27:21,980
What an ETF is, it's essentially like a big kind of colony of stocks in one ticker.

678
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:27,819
So it rises and falls based on the performance of the stuff that the ETF owns.

679
00:27:27,819 --> 00:27:30,240
So let's say you talk about the S&P 500, right?

680
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:30,880
The SPY.

681
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:38,319
That's the weighted index of the top 500 companies in the United States by market value.

682
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:40,480
I'm smart.

683
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,119
I'm smart.

684
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:41,680
I'm smart.

685
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,640
I know what I'm talking about.

686
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:43,519
Okay.

687
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:52,500
So what that's saying is it's just like...

688
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,660
It's taking the average of all the hearts, essentially.

689
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,299
You are wrong.

690
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:55,940
I'm smart.

691
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:56,579
You're wrong.

692
00:27:56,579 --> 00:27:57,140
I'm smart.

693
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:57,700
You're wrong.

694
00:28:00,619 --> 00:28:01,259
Excuse me.

695
00:28:03,259 --> 00:28:06,859
This guy right here lost a substantial amount of money

696
00:28:06,859 --> 00:28:08,779
betting against Beyond Meat a few years ago.

697
00:28:09,339 --> 00:28:10,859
I mean, I think I know what I'm talking about.

698
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:24,859
Anyways, I don't like Jerma when he talks about smart stuff.

699
00:28:24,859 --> 00:28:27,819
No, I'm supposed to be just an idiot, right?

700
00:28:27,819 --> 00:28:28,779
I'm just a dumb guy.

701
00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:29,900
I didn't know anything.

702
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,940
I don't even know how to drive.

703
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:36,029
I don't even know what state I'm in.

704
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:37,950
I'm dumb idiot guy.

705
00:28:38,589 --> 00:28:43,009
I did clog the toilet today, though.

706
00:28:43,569 --> 00:28:44,690
And that was embarrassing.

707
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:47,900
And he's like, I did too, whatever.

708
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,930
I am pretty dumb, don't worry.

709
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:56,509
And I'm smart where it counts.

710
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,369
Okay.

711
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:00,960
You go ahead and read your books.

712
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,480
And you go ahead and read your books and get your A pluses.

713
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,359
I don't care.

714
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:06,319
I'm smart where it counts.

715
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:10,349
I haven't read a book in 10 years.

716
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:11,630
That's how you know I'm smart.

717
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:12,670
Okay, I'm fucking done.

718
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:13,789
Let's go.

719
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:22,690
Market open request.

720
00:29:24,609 --> 00:29:25,890
Nerve clusters.

721
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,859
Okay, nerve clusters.

722
00:29:27,859 --> 00:29:28,740
I don't care how...

723
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,240
All right.

724
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,700
This is dog shit.

725
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,099
I'm not...

726
00:29:32,099 --> 00:29:33,619
They're on 9,300.

727
00:29:33,619 --> 00:29:34,119
What do you want?

728
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,339
What is it?

729
00:29:36,339 --> 00:29:37,619
I need something for an old trick of the trade.

730
00:29:37,619 --> 00:29:40,420
If you run out of disinfectant, you can drip rock...

731
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,180
Rot cane juice into a wound?

732
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,029
What does he want?

733
00:29:45,089 --> 00:29:46,289
I don't really want to know what you want.

734
00:29:46,289 --> 00:29:47,009
What do you want?

735
00:29:47,009 --> 00:29:48,450
This is x6 bladder.

736
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:50,799
How do I do it?

737
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:53,220
Bladder and liver.

738
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,019
Bladder and liver.

739
00:29:54,019 --> 00:29:56,559
You dick.

740
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:57,200
Bladder and liver.

741
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,000
Got it.

742
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,049
Does a bladder look like?

743
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:04,289
This is x6 shit right here.

744
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:06,240
Is it not?

745
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,119
Does it say x6?

746
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:08,859
Is it not?

747
00:30:11,259 --> 00:30:11,980
What does he want?

748
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,980
Two nerve clusters.

749
00:30:14,619 --> 00:30:17,819
Do I have enough?

750
00:30:17,819 --> 00:30:20,430
I need one more.

751
00:30:24,819 --> 00:30:26,259
9,300 bucks.

752
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:27,299
What is this?

753
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:28,259
I don't understand this rot...

754
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:29,380
It means you have six days.

755
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,740
Oh, I thought it was x6.

756
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,180
Run out of disinfectant.

757
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,059
Cut and solder.

758
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,869
I don't even know what this is.

759
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,460
Rare lungs.

760
00:30:46,509 --> 00:30:47,390
Rot cane?

761
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:48,430
Is it something I have to buy?

762
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:55,039
Okay, you want a liver.

763
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:55,680
I don't think I...

764
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,640
No, fuck that.

765
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:00,049
He wants the juice from what though?

766
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,079
What does rot cane juice come from?

767
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,180
Get rot cane.

768
00:31:14,769 --> 00:31:17,809
Pipe, eyeball, size, common, soul.

769
00:31:18,529 --> 00:31:20,130
It's the rot cane.

770
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,569
What is a rot cane?

771
00:31:21,569 --> 00:31:22,930
I feel like you guys are making up a word

772
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:26,609
and I'm going to say like I like balls or something, right?

773
00:31:26,609 --> 00:31:27,490
Like lick my balls.

774
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:30,559
It's the DNA logo?

775
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:34,049
I'm buying this bladder.

776
00:31:34,049 --> 00:31:35,220
I'm going to hold it tomorrow.

777
00:31:35,859 --> 00:31:41,119
I don't understand where it is.

778
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:41,920
I don't see anything.

779
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:52,690
Oh, it's closed.

780
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:54,660
Rot cane is a fluid found in...

781
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,019
Watch out for eyes.

782
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:02,140
It's the organ next to the heart.

783
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,579
I've never heard of a rot cane.

784
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:10,049
How's everything doing?

785
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:13,259
Rot cane.

786
00:32:13,259 --> 00:32:13,579
All right.

787
00:32:13,579 --> 00:32:14,779
Is there a rot cane index?

788
00:32:15,579 --> 00:32:18,289
I should...

789
00:32:18,289 --> 00:32:18,849
Holy shit, dude.

790
00:32:18,849 --> 00:32:19,170
Look at this.

791
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:19,890
This is only $4?

792
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:22,180
This is cheapest shit.

793
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:25,940
I wonder about 100 of these.

794
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:28,819
That'd be 500?

795
00:32:29,539 --> 00:32:29,779
Yeah.

796
00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:31,740
Just watch.

797
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,579
This shit's going to go to like $1,000.

798
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:37,250
This is XCormix index.

799
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:40,319
We've got $2,000 in XCormix.

800
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:43,119
Just wait 10x in like five or six weeks.

801
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:44,609
This is really cheap.

802
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:47,700
Dude, this is too expensive.

803
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:54,940
Damn.

804
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:55,660
Buzzwimble.

805
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,259
Rot cane.

806
00:32:57,259 --> 00:32:57,579
All right.

807
00:32:57,579 --> 00:32:58,779
Well, what the fuck?

808
00:32:58,779 --> 00:32:59,660
I can't even buy it.

809
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,039
All right.

810
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:06,319
Argo.

811
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,000
I have this bladder.

812
00:33:10,269 --> 00:33:10,509
All right.

813
00:33:10,509 --> 00:33:10,829
Let's go.

814
00:33:11,549 --> 00:33:11,869
Bill.

815
00:33:12,509 --> 00:33:14,130
I'm ready.

816
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:14,980
Let's go.

817
00:33:18,589 --> 00:33:19,869
Give me a heart, please.

818
00:33:19,869 --> 00:33:20,190
Heart.

819
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:22,109
You want...

820
00:33:22,109 --> 00:33:23,470
This rot cane guy again.

821
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:24,190
But I don't...

822
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:25,150
It's not showing up anywhere.

823
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:26,640
Eyeball.

824
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:28,369
Fine.

825
00:33:28,369 --> 00:33:29,490
I'll fulfill your dumb request.

826
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:32,019
Oh, I have too many.

827
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,619
All right.

828
00:33:33,619 --> 00:33:34,339
You want eyeball.

829
00:33:35,309 --> 00:33:35,789
And you want...

830
00:33:38,339 --> 00:33:39,859
Heart, eyeball, rot cane.

831
00:33:41,809 --> 00:33:42,049
Oh!

832
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:43,009
Got it.

833
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:45,329
And go.

834
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:50,349
Heart, rot cane, eyeball.

835
00:33:50,349 --> 00:33:51,390
I need an eyeball.

836
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:54,180
What's with this market?

837
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,140
What's with this market?

838
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:55,779
There's nothing on here.

839
00:33:55,779 --> 00:33:56,660
What's with this market?

840
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,140
I just bought...

841
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,099
I just didn't even want to buy that.

842
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:08,690
Okay.

843
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:09,329
Heart.

844
00:34:09,329 --> 00:34:12,420
There's nothing for sale.

845
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,219
What's with this market?

846
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,199
All right.

847
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,179
Now I get why this...

848
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:19,699
You're supposed to do Q and E and shit.

849
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:22,480
Another rot cane?

850
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,989
Right here.

851
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:26,030
That's too expensive, though.

852
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:26,829
I want a cheaper one.

853
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:31,280
Give me a cheaper rot cane.

854
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:31,920
That's...

855
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,559
What the fuck?

856
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:33,599
$7,500?

857
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,250
That's way too much.

858
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:39,730
$7,500.

859
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:40,289
Get out of here.

860
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:43,489
I get $4,000.

861
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:43,650
No.

862
00:34:44,769 --> 00:34:45,730
Dogshit return.

863
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:45,969
I won't...

864
00:34:45,969 --> 00:34:46,369
There we go.

865
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:48,610
Remember the guy that just told me to wait?

866
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:50,050
Remember the guy that told me just to do it?

867
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:50,369
Yeah.

868
00:34:50,369 --> 00:34:51,489
That's a 10x return now.

869
00:34:52,289 --> 00:34:55,969
I'm gonna buy...

870
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:57,409
Okay.

871
00:34:57,409 --> 00:34:58,210
All right.

872
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:01,789
I wonder if I should get something else, too.

873
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:05,539
If I see a rot cane for under $2,000, I'm getting it.

874
00:35:06,179 --> 00:35:06,829
There it is.

875
00:35:07,389 --> 00:35:11,150
I'm buying up all the rot canes.

876
00:35:11,789 --> 00:35:14,110
Another one.

877
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:14,510
Give me it.

878
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:17,389
Another one.

879
00:35:17,389 --> 00:35:17,710
Give me it.

880
00:35:18,269 --> 00:35:20,059
Give me it.

881
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:21,730
Oh, what...

882
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:24,780
What's going on here?

883
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:27,599
Why is this blocked out?

884
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:28,159
Repair?

885
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:33,599
I could have just bought that fucking $1,000.

886
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,420
Wait, does that mean...

887
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:37,650
No.

888
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:38,289
Okay.

889
00:35:38,289 --> 00:35:44,019
$800.

890
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:51,579
Oh, mark is over.

891
00:35:51,579 --> 00:35:51,900
All right.

892
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,300
Not bad.

893
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:53,820
My portfolio...

894
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:54,860
Oh, what's this?

895
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,559
What's this?

896
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:58,619
Excuse me?

897
00:36:00,579 --> 00:36:01,139
Where is it?

898
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,840
Um...

899
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,559
Excuse me?

900
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:13,760
Oh.

901
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,940
It didn't move.

902
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:17,659
Well, look at...

903
00:36:17,659 --> 00:36:18,460
It says my thing.

904
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,739
My portfolio went up a good high.

905
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,159
Rot cane is bad for you.

906
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:22,480
Hull.

907
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:24,449
It is?

908
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:29,019
Corrosive destroys unprotected hulls.

909
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:31,679
Oh, shit.

910
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:37,150
Wait, what about this?

911
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,269
Man, this is sick.

912
00:36:42,269 --> 00:36:42,750
Okay, there's...

913
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:42,989
All right.

914
00:36:42,989 --> 00:36:43,630
There's upgrades.

915
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,179
Slows to the K of all organs by 25%.

916
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:49,940
I don't...

917
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:50,900
I don't want to go broke.

918
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,780
I'll do it tomorrow.

919
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:55,789
Oh.

920
00:36:56,349 --> 00:36:59,500
What do you want?

921
00:37:00,769 --> 00:37:01,170
Zero?

922
00:37:01,809 --> 00:37:02,849
I'll talk.

923
00:37:02,849 --> 00:37:03,809
I'll burn your life down.

924
00:37:03,809 --> 00:37:05,570
So you owe me a mythic lung.

925
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:06,849
And I'm not paying shit.

926
00:37:08,739 --> 00:37:11,219
I knew who you are before the fancy office.

927
00:37:11,219 --> 00:37:11,380
What?

928
00:37:12,019 --> 00:37:14,530
Did I just tell him to fuck off?

929
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:20,400
You exist on my mercy.

930
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:20,639
What...

931
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:21,920
Okay.

932
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,039
Urgent opportunity.

933
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:26,239
Everyone deserves to have organs,

934
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:27,920
but the powers that be benefit fighting each other.

935
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,199
I want a liver.

936
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:30,400
No.

937
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:33,139
All right.

938
00:37:33,139 --> 00:37:33,619
I want...

939
00:37:36,619 --> 00:37:38,059
First segment of the organ barcode

940
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:39,659
is the organ's market number.

941
00:37:39,659 --> 00:37:39,980
Wait.

942
00:37:41,489 --> 00:37:43,090
Heart is zero zero.

943
00:37:43,969 --> 00:37:45,809
Know the number and you know the item.

944
00:37:48,179 --> 00:37:49,780
Oh, so I don't have to...

945
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:50,099
Okay.

946
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:53,869
Heart is zero zero.

947
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:55,550
I can just memorize these.

948
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,389
So double zero is heart.

949
00:37:59,809 --> 00:38:00,050
All right.

950
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:02,769
I need eyeball.

951
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:05,889
Eyeball heart.

952
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,099
No, this is all too cheap.

953
00:38:09,099 --> 00:38:10,699
Do I fulfill this like this guy?

954
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:11,980
Trade already.

955
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:12,860
I'm going for it.

956
00:38:14,219 --> 00:38:14,780
Oh, okay.

957
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,420
That's heart.

958
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,380
I see what they're doing.

959
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:19,170
So I can know exactly...

960
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:20,210
I don't even look at the icon.

961
00:38:23,019 --> 00:38:23,260
Wait.

962
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:28,610
I gotta get rid of this shit.

963
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:30,860
I'll keep one.

964
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:34,030
Okay.

965
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:34,590
Hold on.

966
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:35,869
Does anybody want a rock cane?

967
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,219
What do you want?

968
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:41,539
Fuck.

969
00:38:41,539 --> 00:38:43,300
I'm getting distracted.

970
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:43,780
What do you want?

971
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:45,329
You want...

972
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:48,210
Heart and eyeball.

973
00:38:48,769 --> 00:38:50,860
How much you want to pay?

974
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:51,820
That's too stressful.

975
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,539
All right.

976
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:53,579
Heart for under a thousand.

977
00:38:55,869 --> 00:38:56,269
Eyeball.

978
00:38:56,269 --> 00:38:58,019
Buy it.

979
00:38:58,019 --> 00:39:00,099
Heart for under a thousand.

980
00:39:00,099 --> 00:39:01,860
Double zero, double zero, zero, zero, zero, zero.

981
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:02,579
Right here.

982
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:02,900
Got it.

983
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:10,659
Anybody else have a request?

984
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:12,420
Stomach.

985
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:13,539
You got it.

986
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:17,090
Stomach for how much?

987
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:18,900
168.

988
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:19,940
Get out of here.

989
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:23,199
Stomach, stomach, stomach, stomach, stomach for under a hundred.

990
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:24,719
Stomach for under a hundred.

991
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,429
Stomach for under a hundred.

992
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:31,469
Rock cane.

993
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,119
No.

994
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:33,440
Get it.

995
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:33,679
Sell it.

996
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:34,159
I don't want it.

997
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:37,469
Stomach for under a hundred.

998
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:40,300
Stomach for under a hundred.

999
00:39:42,739 --> 00:39:43,619
Dude, I'm sorry.

1000
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:44,659
I can't fulfill your request.

1001
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:47,219
What does this guy want?

1002
00:39:48,369 --> 00:39:49,170
Mythic lung.

1003
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:49,409
All right.

1004
00:39:49,409 --> 00:39:50,050
Well, I didn't do it.

1005
00:39:51,619 --> 00:39:52,820
Explain calls and puts.

1006
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:54,500
No.

1007
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,300
No, I don't think so.

1008
00:40:03,139 --> 00:40:04,500
This person is going to burn my life down.

1009
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,219
Why?

1010
00:40:05,219 --> 00:40:08,559
How does this game work?

1011
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:09,599
I'm walking my dog.

1012
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:10,000
It's fun.

1013
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:13,579
All right.

1014
00:40:14,139 --> 00:40:18,059
All right.

1015
00:40:18,059 --> 00:40:18,619
30 grand.

1016
00:40:21,579 --> 00:40:23,340
Oh, we have some more competition here.

1017
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,679
Woohoo Charlie.

1018
00:40:27,489 --> 00:40:28,769
Liver, bladders, and kidneys.

1019
00:40:29,409 --> 00:40:34,139
Disgraced prince from a distant star.

1020
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:38,829
Topping up on delightful necessities to keep the party going.

1021
00:40:38,829 --> 00:40:42,829
White emperor gold star.

1022
00:40:42,829 --> 00:40:45,550
Wants rare organs and mythical organs.

1023
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:48,369
And I have it daddy personified.

1024
00:40:48,369 --> 00:40:49,650
The answer is always yes.

1025
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:50,530
Just the worst.

1026
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:58,960
If they're going to buy the expensive stuff though,

1027
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:04,900
should I get favor with the rich emperor kid?

1028
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:09,579
I feel like I might get some gifts.

1029
00:41:09,579 --> 00:41:15,579
So favor is...

1030
00:41:15,579 --> 00:41:16,860
Okay, I got money.

1031
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:21,840
You're still brains, hearts, and lungs and you want rare stuff.

1032
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:27,630
Yellow requests are unique.

1033
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:28,269
Really?

1034
00:41:28,269 --> 00:41:30,260
So woohoo Charlie is cool?

1035
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:34,619
Wants livers, bladders, and kidneys.

1036
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:39,889
I mean, should I get a bunch of favor?

1037
00:41:39,889 --> 00:41:44,219
I'm going to try it.

1038
00:41:44,219 --> 00:41:44,940
I got money.

1039
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,500
See what happens.

1040
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:50,099
The requests, not the traders.

1041
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:53,389
Oh, okay.

1042
00:41:53,389 --> 00:41:53,869
I'm going to pay.

1043
00:41:53,869 --> 00:41:54,349
I'm going to...

1044
00:41:54,349 --> 00:41:55,230
Okay, here we go.

1045
00:41:55,230 --> 00:42:01,409
What does that do?

1046
00:42:01,409 --> 00:42:10,000
Did I just give the rich kid 10 grand for no reason?

1047
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:16,699
Why did I do that?

1048
00:42:16,699 --> 00:42:18,460
Do the yellow requests.

1049
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:19,179
Okay.

1050
00:42:19,179 --> 00:42:30,260
He's a top 100 streamer like you.

1051
00:42:33,889 --> 00:42:37,460
Scammed yourself.

1052
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:38,980
You gave them gift subs.

1053
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:42,739
All right.

1054
00:42:42,739 --> 00:42:44,260
What should I do with this?

1055
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,980
I bought it for $216,000 and I lost money on it.

1056
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,579
But market, market, market.

1057
00:42:48,579 --> 00:42:50,940
This didn't move.

1058
00:42:51,579 --> 00:42:53,980
You know what?

1059
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:55,579
We're doubling down then.

1060
00:42:55,579 --> 00:42:59,579
I'm doubling down on the XCormix.

1061
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:04,769
We're tripling down on the XCormix.

1062
00:43:04,769 --> 00:43:08,880
I want 10 grand in XCormix.

1063
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:09,360
Just wait.

1064
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:09,760
It's going to be...

1065
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,199
This could be a shortage or something.

1066
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:12,000
Trust me.

1067
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,340
All right.

1068
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:15,300
I still have this guy thing.

1069
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,099
I have to fulfill this.

1070
00:43:16,099 --> 00:43:16,980
Let's go.

1071
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:20,690
This person's still here.

1072
00:43:21,329 --> 00:43:21,570
All right.

1073
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:21,969
If I...

1074
00:43:21,969 --> 00:43:26,110
No, I have five days to do this one.

1075
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:28,400
Need another eyeball.

1076
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,440
Six days to get an eyeball.

1077
00:43:30,769 --> 00:43:35,809
Bladder, eye, bladder, eye, bladder, liver.

1078
00:43:35,809 --> 00:43:38,829
Eye, bladder, liver for cheap.

1079
00:43:38,829 --> 00:43:42,929
Eye, bladder, liver, stomach.

1080
00:43:42,929 --> 00:43:44,530
Eye, bladder, liver, stomach.

1081
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:46,289
Eye, bladder, liver, stomach.

1082
00:43:46,289 --> 00:43:47,619
I already have one.

1083
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:48,989
I don't.

1084
00:43:48,989 --> 00:43:49,389
Yeah, I do.

1085
00:43:49,389 --> 00:43:49,889
Here.

1086
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:53,389
Eye, bladder, stomach eye.

1087
00:43:53,389 --> 00:43:55,710
Stomach eye for less than 200.

1088
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:56,980
Stomach eye.

1089
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:57,300
Bingo.

1090
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:57,940
Got it.

1091
00:43:57,940 --> 00:43:59,460
Did I get it?

1092
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:02,559
Oh, that piece of shit.

1093
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:03,360
Bladder.

1094
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:03,860
Got it.

1095
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:04,559
Fuck.

1096
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:04,960
I have to...

1097
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:05,199
I can't...

1098
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:06,079
I'm too slow.

1099
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:09,150
I'm never gonna make the raid.

1100
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:10,510
My DPS is gonna be too low

1101
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:12,269
because I'm in competition with these idiots.

1102
00:44:12,269 --> 00:44:13,730
Did I get it?

1103
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:14,130
I didn't...

1104
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:14,769
What did I buy?

1105
00:44:15,409 --> 00:44:15,969
What do you want?

1106
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:24,320
You want eyeball and a stomach.

1107
00:44:27,219 --> 00:44:27,460
No.

1108
00:44:28,019 --> 00:44:28,420
Stop it.

1109
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:28,900
Give me that.

1110
00:44:29,619 --> 00:44:31,099
Eyeball.

1111
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:36,980
There we go.

1112
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:37,539
Oh my god.

1113
00:44:37,539 --> 00:44:38,820
I have to compete with these idiots.

1114
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:43,699
This one's valuable.

1115
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:47,090
My DPS is too low.

1116
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:49,710
The second segment of an organ barcode

1117
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:50,829
is the organ size.

1118
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:53,059
D is tiny.

1119
00:44:53,059 --> 00:44:53,940
C is small.

1120
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:54,659
B is average.

1121
00:44:54,659 --> 00:44:55,380
A is large.

1122
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:56,340
S is gigantic.

1123
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:57,780
Oh god damn it.

1124
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:58,099
Okay.

1125
00:44:59,219 --> 00:45:01,699
So zero A is a huge heart.

1126
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:04,019
Zero S is a gigantic...

1127
00:45:04,019 --> 00:45:04,420
No.

1128
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:05,059
Zero zero.

1129
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:09,019
Zero zero S is big.

1130
00:45:09,019 --> 00:45:09,659
Zero zero.

1131
00:45:09,659 --> 00:45:09,820
Okay.

1132
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:10,940
So it's just grades.

1133
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,889
This is the size of the organ.

1134
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:17,840
So for instance, if we go to the hearts,

1135
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,199
this is zero zero D.

1136
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:20,239
Zero zero heart.

1137
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:22,530
It's very small.

1138
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:23,889
This is a huge heart right here.

1139
00:45:23,889 --> 00:45:24,769
You know what I mean?

1140
00:45:24,769 --> 00:45:26,659
I think I need to drink a little

1141
00:45:26,659 --> 00:45:27,780
fucking cup of coffee for this one.

1142
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:35,039
There's a B.

1143
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:35,360
Got it.

1144
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:37,199
That one was a pretty good one.

1145
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:39,070
There's a B.

1146
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:39,469
I guess.

1147
00:45:39,469 --> 00:45:39,869
I don't know.

1148
00:45:39,869 --> 00:45:40,349
Should I have it?

1149
00:45:40,909 --> 00:45:42,030
What do you want?

1150
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:43,550
Liver.

1151
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:45,949
What does a liver look like?

1152
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:51,699
Kidney?

1153
00:45:54,369 --> 00:45:54,929
Stomach?

1154
00:45:54,929 --> 00:45:55,570
What is a liver?

1155
00:45:58,500 --> 00:45:59,539
Devs tweeted about you.

1156
00:46:00,659 --> 00:46:03,010
Oh, look at me.

1157
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:03,650
What is a liver?

1158
00:46:04,289 --> 00:46:08,260
You guys know how big your liver actually is.

1159
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,610
How much are you going to pay me?

1160
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:11,489
I don't think that's worth it.

1161
00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:15,889
Oh.

1162
00:46:15,889 --> 00:46:16,289
All right.

1163
00:46:19,789 --> 00:46:21,469
Oh, 20%.

1164
00:46:22,909 --> 00:46:26,670
There it is.

1165
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:27,789
Two grand in the bank.

1166
00:46:27,789 --> 00:46:28,829
I'm not selling it.

1167
00:46:28,829 --> 00:46:29,789
I'm not selling it to at least,

1168
00:46:29,789 --> 00:46:31,150
it's at least a thousand.

1169
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:36,619
All right.

1170
00:46:36,619 --> 00:46:37,579
These are pretty valuable.

1171
00:46:37,579 --> 00:46:39,420
Common, common mythic.

1172
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:40,139
I have a mythic eye.

1173
00:46:41,019 --> 00:46:44,300
Zero two is liver.

1174
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:44,940
Okay.

1175
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:48,030
Oh, I'm going to have to memorize this.

1176
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:49,469
Aren't I going to be this thing

1177
00:46:49,469 --> 00:46:50,349
turned to papers, please.

1178
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:50,670
Isn't it?

1179
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:54,380
Stop losing value.

1180
00:46:55,019 --> 00:46:59,329
I buy some more.

1181
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:01,170
Anything else like crash?

1182
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:07,679
Nothing.

1183
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:09,119
Everything seems doing okay.

1184
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:15,889
Yeah, my stock went up.

1185
00:47:15,889 --> 00:47:16,610
Oh, yeah.

1186
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:19,300
I'm not selling it.

1187
00:47:23,409 --> 00:47:25,010
You still need a liver.

1188
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:25,889
Liver is zero two.

1189
00:47:25,889 --> 00:47:26,369
You said, okay.

1190
00:47:26,369 --> 00:47:27,170
Let's go.

1191
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:30,179
This guy's back again.

1192
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:37,869
Dude, like, oh, soul.

1193
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:40,030
And I'm tired.

1194
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:41,630
You want just, I want a soul.

1195
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:45,059
Soul, nerve cluster.

1196
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:49,969
Soul, nerve cluster, and heart.

1197
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:53,570
Soul, nerve cluster, and heart.

1198
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:55,489
Soul, nerve cluster, heart.

1199
00:47:55,489 --> 00:47:56,769
Soul, nerve, soul.

1200
00:47:56,769 --> 00:47:59,420
That's two, got it.

1201
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:00,619
Fuck off, buddy.

1202
00:48:00,619 --> 00:48:01,019
Liver.

1203
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:02,400
Wait, what?

1204
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:03,920
What is all this shit?

1205
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,039
Why do I have all these bladders?

1206
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,860
I snipe that guy so bad.

1207
00:48:10,739 --> 00:48:12,510
All right.

1208
00:48:13,389 --> 00:48:15,309
Liver and I got new organs.

1209
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:24,030
Liver and liver and wait.

1210
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:27,170
The third segment of an organ barcode

1211
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:28,289
is the organ's condition.

1212
00:48:28,289 --> 00:48:31,650
If the barcode is the condition is 60.

1213
00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:33,980
God.

1214
00:48:35,099 --> 00:48:40,769
So it goes organ type, size, condition.

1215
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:45,940
Organ type, size, condition.

1216
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:50,300
This is too much for my fucking pea brain.

1217
00:48:51,099 --> 00:48:52,619
Oh, this 9100.

1218
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:54,300
Rot cane, got it.

1219
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:56,619
Not a scam.

1220
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:58,139
This is a scam.

1221
00:48:58,139 --> 00:48:58,619
I lie.

1222
00:48:58,619 --> 00:48:59,820
Do not send me a heart.

1223
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:02,300
I cannot make amends for this failure of conscience.

1224
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:03,179
But I am so sorry.

1225
00:49:03,179 --> 00:49:04,460
I deserve nothing in this world.

1226
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:04,780
Goodbye.

1227
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:05,340
I'll get it for you.

1228
00:49:06,059 --> 00:49:06,619
You want a heart?

1229
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:10,159
Here.

1230
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,300
Okay.

1231
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:18,639
Now I need rot cane, nerve, liver.

1232
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,940
No way.

1233
00:49:21,579 --> 00:49:22,860
Rot cane, nerve, liver, nerve.

1234
00:49:23,579 --> 00:49:27,179
Rot cane, rot cane, rot cane, rot cane, rot cane, rot cane.

1235
00:49:27,179 --> 00:49:27,659
Nerve.

1236
00:49:27,659 --> 00:49:28,219
That's too much.

1237
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:31,650
Come on.

1238
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:34,449
I'll buy that stomach and I'll buy that eye.

1239
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:37,230
All bladder.

1240
00:49:37,230 --> 00:49:38,260
Okay.

1241
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:38,659
Nerve.

1242
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:40,739
I need a nerve.

1243
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:42,340
Rot cane, nerve.

1244
00:49:43,809 --> 00:49:44,849
Stop buying shit.

1245
00:49:44,849 --> 00:49:46,530
We need more stuff on the market.

1246
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:48,050
You idiot.

1247
00:49:48,050 --> 00:49:48,610
I'll buy that.

1248
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:49,250
I'll buy that too.

1249
00:49:49,969 --> 00:49:52,750
How much are you gonna give me for the nerve?

1250
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:55,920
Oh, buy it.

1251
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,480
Eat shit.

1252
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:06,079
I got it.

1253
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:07,199
Oh my God.

1254
00:50:07,199 --> 00:50:09,360
Why do I have so many of these?

1255
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:14,610
What do you guys need?

1256
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:14,929
All right.

1257
00:50:14,929 --> 00:50:16,929
You want a nerve cluster for $3,200.

1258
00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:19,329
Oh.

1259
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:26,289
All right.

1260
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:26,929
That was a good day.

1261
00:50:27,489 --> 00:50:30,480
Still, I got 12 grand over here still.

1262
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:31,360
I'm fine.

1263
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:37,730
Maybe I should upgrade my, um...

1264
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:39,550
Should I sell some stock?

1265
00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:40,750
Nah.

1266
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:41,469
No.

1267
00:50:41,469 --> 00:50:45,570
Hey, a real-life Devon chat here.

1268
00:50:45,570 --> 00:50:47,969
I hacked Kinect support into this game before it launched.

1269
00:50:47,969 --> 00:50:50,210
This is not a bit, though it is objectively funny.

1270
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:52,929
If you plug in a Kinect on PC and step in front of it, it'll work.

1271
00:50:53,969 --> 00:50:54,289
What?

1272
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:56,420
What are you talking?

1273
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:56,739
Why?

1274
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:00,500
Why would you do that?

1275
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:04,909
I don't think that makes any sense.

1276
00:51:05,789 --> 00:51:08,590
I need to get the Kinect drivers for the computer.

1277
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:09,630
I don't think that makes any sense.

1278
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:12,829
It's because it was funny.

1279
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:16,530
I don't...

1280
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:17,889
I don't even know where my Kinect is.

1281
00:51:18,849 --> 00:51:22,380
I don't know.

1282
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:24,699
I have a feeling I'm gonna plug that in and the Kinect's gonna turn on.

1283
00:51:24,699 --> 00:51:26,460
It's gonna take a bunch of pictures of me sitting here naked.

1284
00:51:27,019 --> 00:51:28,059
I don't know if I want to do that.

1285
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:35,099
Don't find it.

1286
00:51:35,659 --> 00:51:36,300
Maybe later.

1287
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:37,920
I'm trading.

1288
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:38,400
I'm trading.

1289
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,440
I'm wheeling and dealing here.

1290
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:39,920
Give me a minute.

1291
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:42,239
Just do it.

1292
00:51:42,239 --> 00:51:44,139
I feel...

1293
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:46,139
What if it crashes my stream?

1294
00:51:48,670 --> 00:51:48,909
All right.

1295
00:51:48,909 --> 00:51:49,309
Hold on.

1296
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:50,110
Let me...

1297
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:53,309
I have to put clothes on.

1298
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:55,230
Does it take pictures of you?

1299
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:58,269
I'm so concerned about this for no reason.

1300
00:51:58,269 --> 00:51:59,579
All right.

1301
00:51:59,579 --> 00:52:01,260
This guy's Messy Marcus.

1302
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:02,139
He doesn't have any goals.

1303
00:52:02,699 --> 00:52:05,179
A panicking, anxious, desperate wreck.

1304
00:52:05,179 --> 00:52:06,780
If they could escape themselves, they would.

1305
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,090
Here.

1306
00:52:09,090 --> 00:52:10,530
Take $86 and fuck off.

1307
00:52:13,699 --> 00:52:15,539
Ipe Emperor Gold Star.

1308
00:52:15,539 --> 00:52:16,610
No.

1309
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:23,380
Get dressed.

1310
00:52:25,139 --> 00:52:28,579
What if it crashed my stream with like the Spongebob text

1311
00:52:28,579 --> 00:52:30,420
leaning down doing like the Spongebob stance?

1312
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:34,159
I'm trying...

1313
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:35,440
Let me just get used to the game first.

1314
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:36,800
It hasn't even been like 40 minutes.

1315
00:52:40,670 --> 00:52:42,110
It actually works.

1316
00:52:42,110 --> 00:52:44,190
I promise I will plug in my Kinect.

1317
00:52:44,190 --> 00:52:44,750
But not yet.

1318
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:49,309
Is the Kinect USB?

1319
00:52:49,309 --> 00:52:50,030
God damn it.

1320
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:56,320
All right.

1321
00:52:57,039 --> 00:52:57,920
I'm not holding anything.

1322
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,360
Let's do trading day start.

1323
00:52:59,360 --> 00:52:59,760
Let's go.

1324
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:03,519
Okay.

1325
00:53:03,519 --> 00:53:04,480
I like this guy.

1326
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,940
Fratera Open Market sent me a heart.

1327
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:10,340
I will compensate you over 20 times after it arrives.

1328
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:10,980
Oh my God.

1329
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:11,219
Okay.

1330
00:53:11,219 --> 00:53:11,460
Heart.

1331
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:14,059
Eyeball.

1332
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:18,110
Ah, naughty creature.

1333
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:18,909
I know what you did.

1334
00:53:18,909 --> 00:53:19,789
If you do not want...

1335
00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:23,389
If you do not want everyone to know your big secret,

1336
00:53:23,389 --> 00:53:25,230
you'll send me a stomach via private...

1337
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:25,710
All right.

1338
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:26,030
Whatever.

1339
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:29,360
What do we need here?

1340
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:30,719
This guy is fucking weird.

1341
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:31,920
Heart.

1342
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:32,400
Eyeball.

1343
00:53:33,199 --> 00:53:33,519
Heart.

1344
00:53:35,409 --> 00:53:35,730
Nerve.

1345
00:53:36,449 --> 00:53:36,929
Eyeball.

1346
00:53:36,929 --> 00:53:37,250
Heart.

1347
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:37,570
Nerve.

1348
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:38,530
Liver.

1349
00:53:39,619 --> 00:53:40,420
Eyebar.

1350
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:40,900
Eyeheart.

1351
00:53:41,539 --> 00:53:41,940
Eyeho...

1352
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:46,900
Eyeheart radio.

1353
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:49,219
What do I need?

1354
00:53:49,219 --> 00:53:49,940
An eyeball.

1355
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:53,260
Eyeball.

1356
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:53,579
Heart.

1357
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:55,519
Eyeball.

1358
00:53:55,519 --> 00:53:56,159
I'm fucking...

1359
00:53:56,159 --> 00:53:56,960
I'm messed up.

1360
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:57,360
Eyeball.

1361
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:57,679
Heart.

1362
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,179
Just one at a time.

1363
00:54:01,179 --> 00:54:01,579
I can't...

1364
00:54:01,579 --> 00:54:02,059
Too slow.

1365
00:54:02,059 --> 00:54:02,780
I'm too slow.

1366
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:05,900
Nerve.

1367
00:54:07,539 --> 00:54:08,099
Nerve.

1368
00:54:08,099 --> 00:54:08,659
Eyeball.

1369
00:54:09,219 --> 00:54:09,539
Liver.

1370
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:13,300
Why do I keep buying stomachs?

1371
00:54:14,099 --> 00:54:14,500
Eyeball.

1372
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:15,699
Liver.

1373
00:54:17,489 --> 00:54:18,210
Liver.

1374
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:18,769
Zero.

1375
00:54:18,769 --> 00:54:19,010
Two.

1376
00:54:21,139 --> 00:54:21,539
Zero.

1377
00:54:22,099 --> 00:54:22,579
Eyeball.

1378
00:54:23,519 --> 00:54:24,800
I don't need two.

1379
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:25,360
Liver.

1380
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:25,599
Step...

1381
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:26,079
What do I need?

1382
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:30,019
Okay.

1383
00:54:30,019 --> 00:54:33,010
Um, I made money on that shit.

1384
00:54:34,539 --> 00:54:36,219
Nerve cluster and liver.

1385
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:40,019
Got it.

1386
00:54:40,019 --> 00:54:40,820
Liver.

1387
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:43,570
What's that?

1388
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:45,099
Shift walks.

1389
00:54:45,739 --> 00:54:46,800
I don't know what the hell that...

1390
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:51,090
How is that not a liver?

1391
00:54:51,650 --> 00:54:53,469
It's a liver.

1392
00:54:53,469 --> 00:54:53,949
What do you want?

1393
00:54:54,590 --> 00:54:57,469
I just want...

1394
00:54:57,469 --> 00:54:57,949
Okay.

1395
00:54:57,949 --> 00:54:58,269
Request.

1396
00:54:58,269 --> 00:54:58,829
Who wants what?

1397
00:54:58,829 --> 00:54:59,389
Who wants what?

1398
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:01,119
I got...

1399
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:02,639
Give me a liver above 54.

1400
00:55:02,639 --> 00:55:03,039
You got it.

1401
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,039
Uh, give me a stomach.

1402
00:55:05,039 --> 00:55:07,820
Sure.

1403
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:08,380
Um, okay.

1404
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:09,579
Liver.

1405
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:12,139
This is liver.

1406
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:14,820
54 liver.

1407
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:15,539
Any liver.

1408
00:55:15,539 --> 00:55:17,059
54 liver, stomach, liver.

1409
00:55:17,059 --> 00:55:18,820
54 liver, stomach, liver.

1410
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:20,659
54 liver, stomach, liver.

1411
00:55:20,659 --> 00:55:22,260
54 liver, stomach, liver.

1412
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:24,260
54 liver, stomach, liver.

1413
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:25,860
54 liver, stomach, liver.

1414
00:55:27,409 --> 00:55:29,170
54 liver, stomach, liver.

1415
00:55:29,889 --> 00:55:30,210
Whoops.

1416
00:55:30,929 --> 00:55:38,460
Damn it.

1417
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:38,940
Didn't go up.

1418
00:55:44,159 --> 00:55:44,480
Ooh.

1419
00:55:45,039 --> 00:55:47,099
I dipped on that.

1420
00:55:47,659 --> 00:55:52,289
Jeremiah, have you on the background?

1421
00:55:52,289 --> 00:55:55,010
It sounds like you're just buying organs from chat members.

1422
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:05,019
Imagine how fast you could do this if you were doing the minority report with the connect.

1423
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:12,190
All right.

1424
00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:12,750
What am I doing?

1425
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:13,150
Here we are.

1426
00:56:14,110 --> 00:56:17,789
54 liver.

1427
00:56:19,949 --> 00:56:20,349
Let's go.

1428
00:56:21,230 --> 00:56:22,460
All right.

1429
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:22,940
What do you got?

1430
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:25,389
I need a heart and a soul.

1431
00:56:25,389 --> 00:56:25,789
Thanks.

1432
00:56:26,429 --> 00:56:26,989
Heart, soul.

1433
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:29,380
Heart, soul, kidney.

1434
00:56:30,179 --> 00:56:32,219
Heart, soul, kidney, liver, kidney.

1435
00:56:32,219 --> 00:56:33,739
Heart, soul, double kidney.

1436
00:56:33,739 --> 00:56:35,980
Heart, soul, double kidney, liver, kidney.

1437
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:37,099
Heart, soul, liver, kidney.

1438
00:56:37,099 --> 00:56:37,980
I don't fucking remember.

1439
00:56:38,699 --> 00:56:39,730
Just one at a time.

1440
00:56:40,449 --> 00:56:42,380
I gotta have a system here.

1441
00:56:44,429 --> 00:56:44,829
Kidney.

1442
00:56:47,090 --> 00:56:48,690
Heart, soul, kidney.

1443
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:50,539
Heart, soul, kidney.

1444
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:52,480
I can do this like the planets.

1445
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:57,199
Like my mother, uh, told me to whatever it is like doing all the planets.

1446
00:56:59,360 --> 00:56:59,920
Heart.

1447
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:00,239
Okay.

1448
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:01,280
Kidney.

1449
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:01,840
Leave me alone.

1450
00:57:02,639 --> 00:57:04,079
Organ's blood type.

1451
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:05,760
If you don't know what a blood type is, I can't help you.

1452
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:06,800
That's a fourth segment.

1453
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:07,440
Oh my God.

1454
00:57:08,159 --> 00:57:10,179
Heart, kidney.

1455
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:12,349
Heart, soul, kidney.

1456
00:57:13,070 --> 00:57:15,329
Heart, soul, kidney, liver.

1457
00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:18,210
Heart, soul, kidney, liver, 54 liver.

1458
00:57:18,210 --> 00:57:20,449
Heart, soul, kidney, liver, 54 liver.

1459
00:57:20,449 --> 00:57:21,889
Heart, soul, kidney.

1460
00:57:21,889 --> 00:57:24,050
Heart, soul, kidney, liver, 54 liver.

1461
00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:28,449
Heart, soul, liver, 54 liver, kidney.

1462
00:57:28,449 --> 00:57:29,809
Heart, soul, kidney.

1463
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:33,360
54 liver, kidney.

1464
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:35,920
Heart, soul, liver, 54 liver, kidney.

1465
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:42,880
Heart, soul, kidney, liver, 54 kidney.

1466
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,960
Heart, soul, liver, 54 kidney.

1467
00:57:50,739 --> 00:57:51,539
No, just fulfill these.

1468
00:57:51,539 --> 00:57:52,019
I already have them.

1469
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:57,219
What do I have?

1470
00:57:57,219 --> 00:57:57,940
Nothing.

1471
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:05,519
Kidney, liver, 50 liver, 50 kidney, liver, liver, 54.

1472
00:58:06,239 --> 00:58:07,920
Kidney, liver, 54, 54.

1473
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:09,840
Kidney, liver, 54.

1474
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:11,920
Okay, I need 54.

1475
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:16,269
Come on, dude.

1476
00:58:16,269 --> 00:58:16,989
Really?

1477
00:58:16,989 --> 00:58:21,500
54 liver.

1478
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:24,059
Kidney, liver.

1479
00:58:25,789 --> 00:58:26,750
I need that liver.

1480
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:28,829
I'll give you 334 right now.

1481
00:58:29,389 --> 00:58:30,909
You have to decide right now, right now.

1482
00:58:30,909 --> 00:58:31,869
It's values depreciating.

1483
00:58:31,869 --> 00:58:33,070
Right now, before it's too late.

1484
00:58:33,070 --> 00:58:34,269
Okay, okay.

1485
00:58:34,269 --> 00:58:35,760
I know who you are.

1486
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:36,559
Give me a lung.

1487
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:37,039
I don't care.

1488
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:41,940
Wait, what?

1489
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:42,739
Liver right now.

1490
00:58:43,619 --> 00:58:45,460
Liver, liver, liver, kidney.

1491
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:48,179
Liver, liver, liver, 54 kidney.

1492
00:58:48,179 --> 00:58:51,460
Liver, liver, liver, liver, liver, liver, liver, liver, liver, 54 kidney.

1493
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:52,659
And there's a lot of livers on the market.

1494
00:58:53,460 --> 00:59:01,579
All right, I'm making money.

1495
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:05,360
What is happening?

1496
00:59:06,239 --> 00:59:06,800
It's fun.

1497
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:09,570
Okay, you know what?

1498
00:59:09,570 --> 00:59:11,250
I leave.

1499
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:11,650
I don't want this.

1500
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:13,570
This guy is buying all the livers and all the kidneys.

1501
00:59:13,570 --> 00:59:13,969
Go home.

1502
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:17,940
Messy Marcus is here again.

1503
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:18,500
You leave too.

1504
00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:21,070
All of you leave.

1505
00:59:21,070 --> 00:59:22,269
I don't care about hearts and lungs.

1506
00:59:22,269 --> 00:59:22,909
Go fuck yourself.

1507
00:59:23,789 --> 00:59:24,750
That was mean.

1508
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:25,389
I'm sorry.

1509
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:29,300
I need livers.

1510
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:31,139
I have to get rid of the people that are buying livers.

1511
00:59:47,219 --> 00:59:52,380
Okay, apologize to the quartermaster now.

1512
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:54,539
No, we're all rotten scumbags, okay?

1513
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:56,059
Look what we're doing.

1514
00:59:56,780 --> 01:00:01,119
Such a weird image too.

1515
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:03,360
Okay, so let me get this right.

1516
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:04,960
I need a bunch of livers.

1517
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:10,300
I think I need three livers and a kidney and one has to be above 54.

1518
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:10,539
Go.

1519
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:18,480
No, come on.

1520
01:00:23,170 --> 01:00:24,289
I'm not going to pay attention to any of that.

1521
01:00:26,050 --> 01:00:26,690
I need livers.

1522
01:00:27,409 --> 01:00:32,349
I need livers and one kidney.

1523
01:00:32,989 --> 01:00:34,590
This is way too much money.

1524
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:40,699
No one's buying it so I can just sit there and depreciate.

1525
01:00:40,699 --> 01:00:41,099
I don't care.

1526
01:00:44,130 --> 01:00:45,090
There's one liver.

1527
01:00:45,809 --> 01:00:47,900
All right.

1528
01:00:48,539 --> 01:00:51,550
I need more than that.

1529
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:54,880
Come on, man.

1530
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:00,030
In the meantime, heart.

1531
01:01:03,489 --> 01:01:04,050
I need another liver.

1532
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:08,960
I need a 54 liver or a shitty heart.

1533
01:01:09,519 --> 01:01:13,900
What's with this market?

1534
01:01:14,539 --> 01:01:18,260
What's with this market?

1535
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:18,820
There it is.

1536
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:19,940
Finally, 54.

1537
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:20,579
That's good.

1538
01:01:20,579 --> 01:01:21,300
All right, let's go.

1539
01:01:22,019 --> 01:01:22,260
Bang.

1540
01:01:25,409 --> 01:01:26,050
54.

1541
01:01:26,610 --> 01:01:27,730
That's so expensive.

1542
01:01:28,769 --> 01:01:29,969
I'm going to lose money on this.

1543
01:01:31,010 --> 01:01:33,940
All right, take that.

1544
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:37,380
Now we need a heart, liver, and a kidney.

1545
01:01:38,179 --> 01:01:39,969
Give me this.

1546
01:01:39,969 --> 01:01:40,570
Okay, perfect.

1547
01:01:40,570 --> 01:01:40,789
Got it.

1548
01:01:40,789 --> 01:01:41,329
That was cheap.

1549
01:01:41,329 --> 01:01:45,380
I'll give some more requests there.

1550
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:49,760
Okay, casual.

1551
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,349
There's a cloning lab.

1552
01:01:52,349 --> 01:01:54,590
They figured out how to make organs but they need materials.

1553
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:57,789
I don't have much but please help me help the rest of us.

1554
01:01:57,789 --> 01:01:59,150
One average lung, please.

1555
01:01:59,150 --> 01:01:59,389
All right.

1556
01:01:59,389 --> 01:01:59,710
Sure.

1557
01:01:59,710 --> 01:02:03,329
What do you have that idiot want ?

1558
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:05,659
Stomach.

1559
01:02:05,659 --> 01:02:05,940
Eye.

1560
01:02:07,199 --> 01:02:07,519

1561
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:08,480
Stomach.

1562
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:08,960
Eye.

1563
01:02:11,099 --> 01:02:11,420
Heart.

1564
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:11,739
Stomach.

1565
01:02:11,739 --> 01:02:11,900
Eye.

1566
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:12,139
Liver.

1567
01:02:12,139 --> 01:02:12,219
Heart.

1568
01:02:12,219 --> 01:02:12,539
Stomach.

1569
01:02:12,539 --> 01:02:12,619
Eye.

1570
01:02:12,619 --> 01:02:12,860
Liver.

1571
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:13,019
Heart.

1572
01:02:13,019 --> 01:02:13,260
Stomach.

1573
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:13,340
Eye.

1574
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:13,579
Liver.

1575
01:02:13,579 --> 01:02:13,659
Heart.

1576
01:02:13,659 --> 01:02:13,980
Stomach.

1577
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:14,079
Eye.

1578
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:14,219
Liver.

1579
01:02:14,219 --> 01:02:14,300
Heart.

1580
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:14,539
Stomach.

1581
01:02:14,539 --> 01:02:14,699
Eye.

1582
01:02:14,699 --> 01:02:14,860
Liver.

1583
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:22,159
liver heart, a liver heart, a liver heart, steps on the car, liver heart, a liver heart,

01:02:22,159 --> 01:02:32,280
Emma, god, liver heart, stomach, heart, stuff and I lyrical heart.

01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:45,260
Holy shit, that was 3,500 bucks.

1589
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:46,570
What?

1590
01:02:46,570 --> 01:02:47,670
That was so expensive.

1591
01:02:47,670 --> 01:03:01,539
Oh, higher.

1592
01:03:01,539 --> 01:03:05,559
I'm sick of waiting.

1593
01:03:05,559 --> 01:03:06,760
And this is what we doubled down again.

1594
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:27,449
I have 4,000 shares of this XCormix ETF, it's just going to 50 bucks.

1595
01:03:27,449 --> 01:03:31,710
Alright, you wanted a heart, take it.

1596
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:39,130
You need to hedge your investment, massive loss incoming.

1597
01:03:39,130 --> 01:03:42,449
Now I understand why you lost everything on Beyond Meat, I didn't, okay let me, let's

1598
01:03:42,449 --> 01:03:48,679
be really clear, I didn't lose everything on Beyond Meat, I didn't lose everything.

1599
01:03:48,679 --> 01:03:55,139
I traded with a little bit of money and lost that money, I didn't lose everything.

1600
01:03:55,139 --> 01:04:02,179
I lost a small portion of what I would consider to be a small, it was a small amount, please

1601
01:04:02,179 --> 01:04:03,179
don't twist it.

1602

Alright, this is still doing okay, notable traits, successfully scammed.

1603
01:04:18,289 --> 01:04:21,250

Heart, bladder, I need a bladder.

1808
01:37:46,140 --> 01:37:47,420
Ah, all right.

1809
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:55,199
Come on, go.

1810
01:37:55,199 --> 01:37:56,039
The devs tweet.

1811
01:37:56,039 --> 01:37:57,899
What's the Twitter?

1812
01:37:57,899 --> 01:38:05,920
I need to see it.

1813
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:10,479
Time to see it.

1814
01:38:10,479 --> 01:38:16,720
What are they saying?

1815
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:20,079
Come on.

1816
01:38:20,079 --> 01:38:21,239
The fact that this is too late

1817
01:38:21,239 --> 01:38:23,279
for Jerma's yearly award show is criminal.

1818
01:38:23,279 --> 01:38:25,399
This entire Kinect bit is usually best joke

1819
01:38:25,399 --> 01:38:27,359
that took over five minutes.

1820
01:38:27,359 --> 01:38:29,000
You've given this man a mental breakdown.

1821
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,239
Is there actually no such thing

1822
01:38:31,239 --> 01:38:32,800
as Kinect support for this game?

1823
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:37,390
Was that like a 20 minute, I just got had?

1824
01:38:37,390 --> 01:38:46,039
He found his Kinect.

1825
01:38:46,039 --> 01:38:48,560
It can't be real.

1826
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:50,359
54 liver, stomach, liver.

1827
01:38:50,359 --> 01:38:52,000
I can't believe you've now made Jerma worry

1828
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,159
about the Kinect taking pictures of him nude.

1829
01:38:54,159 --> 01:39:04,159
Ah, this is funny.

1830
01:39:04,159 --> 01:39:05,000
It's not real.

1831
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:05,920
I don't believe it's real.

1832
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:07,640
It can't be.

1833
01:39:07,640 --> 01:39:11,569
I can't plug that shit into my computer.

1834
01:39:11,569 --> 01:39:15,250
Kinect FAQ.

1835
01:39:15,250 --> 01:39:18,880
Wait, okay.

1836
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:20,840
FAQ, yes, we support Kinect.

1837
01:39:20,840 --> 01:39:21,800
Does this game support Kinect?

1838
01:39:21,800 --> 01:39:23,439
Yes, on PC only.

1839
01:39:23,439 --> 01:39:25,199
If you plug in a Kinect 2.0 to your computer

1840
01:39:25,199 --> 01:39:26,039
while the game is open,

1841
01:39:26,039 --> 01:39:27,279
you can play through the entirety of the game

1842
01:39:27,279 --> 01:39:28,560
using Kinect controls.

1843
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:30,239
Grab meat with your meat hands.

1844
01:39:30,239 --> 01:39:31,239
Your body is to control it.

1845
01:39:31,239 --> 01:39:32,079
We live in the future.

1846
01:39:32,079 --> 01:39:35,319
Good luck.

1847
01:39:35,319 --> 01:39:40,289
I guess I have the original like dog shit Kinect.

1848
01:39:40,289 --> 01:39:48,109
Thing that uses like an orange display port.

1849
01:39:48,109 --> 01:39:52,529
What are you linking me with?

1850
01:39:52,529 --> 01:39:55,609
Oh, it's somebody using it with the Kinect.

1851
01:39:55,609 --> 01:39:57,789
Are you kidding me?

1852
01:39:57,789 --> 01:40:00,729
Ah, this is fun.

1853
01:40:00,729 --> 01:40:01,569
This game's fun.

1854
01:40:01,569 --> 01:40:02,409
I like this game.

1855
01:40:02,409 --> 01:40:03,250
All right, let's go.

1856
01:40:12,409 --> 01:40:14,340
All right, let's move.

1857
01:40:14,340 --> 01:40:15,180
What do you want?

1858
01:40:15,180 --> 01:40:19,590
Heart, bladder.

1859
01:40:19,590 --> 01:40:20,670
I need a heart and a bladder.

1860
01:40:20,670 --> 01:40:22,550
So we have a heart and now we need a bladder.

1861
01:40:22,750 --> 01:40:26,720
Heart is more expensive than what he wants.

1862
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:28,119
Okay, just need a bladder.

1863
01:40:28,119 --> 01:40:31,630
These are going up in value.

1864
01:40:31,630 --> 01:40:36,010
Again, what do I need?

1865
01:40:36,010 --> 01:40:37,930
Heart, I need a bladder.

1866
01:40:37,930 --> 01:40:39,289
No, not a gall bladder.

1867
01:40:39,289 --> 01:40:42,039
The dev is debating me.

1868
01:40:42,039 --> 01:40:42,880
What the fuck?

1869
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:44,319
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1870
01:40:44,319 --> 01:40:45,159
What the fuck?

1871
01:40:45,159 --> 01:40:47,079
I hit E instead of W.

1872
01:40:47,079 --> 01:40:48,760
No, heart is $180.

1873
01:40:48,760 --> 01:40:49,600
Are you kidding me?

1874
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:52,319
That's cheap.

1875
01:40:52,319 --> 01:40:53,199
I gotta chill out.

1876
01:40:53,199 --> 01:40:56,250
Relax.

1877
01:40:56,250 --> 01:40:59,840
I need a bladder.

1878
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:00,960
Get some more of these.

1879
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:05,859
No, focus.

1880
01:41:05,859 --> 01:41:07,300
What the hell do you guys want?

1881
01:41:07,340 --> 01:41:09,100
Stomach in five days.

1882
01:41:09,100 --> 01:41:12,680
I want a heart and I want a nerve cluster.

1883
01:41:12,680 --> 01:41:13,920
Yeah, I got five days to do these.

1884
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:15,960
Nerve cluster and stomach.

1885
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:19,829
Stomach and shift works.

1886
01:41:19,829 --> 01:41:21,189
Oh my God, you idiot.

1887
01:41:21,189 --> 01:41:24,119
Just get rid of these stupid kidneys.

1888
01:41:24,119 --> 01:41:25,479
No, this one.

1889
01:41:25,479 --> 01:41:28,479
No, I wanted to find, no, dude.

1890
01:41:28,479 --> 01:41:30,989
What the hell?

1891
01:41:30,989 --> 01:41:33,550
Here.

1892
01:41:33,550 --> 01:41:35,880
I need a heart and a bladder.

1893
01:41:35,880 --> 01:41:47,420
I need a bladder now.

1894
01:41:47,420 --> 01:41:51,430
Bladder, now.

1895
01:41:51,430 --> 01:41:53,670
Oh my God, that was cheap.

1896
01:41:54,390 --> 01:41:55,510
Did you see this thing?

1897
01:41:55,510 --> 01:41:59,590
93 quality, small, blood type AB, mythic quality, $200.

1898
01:41:59,590 --> 01:42:02,699
This thing's worth at least a thousand.

1899
01:42:02,699 --> 01:42:05,779
All right, stop being like a fucking comedy guy.

1900
01:42:05,779 --> 01:42:12,000
Need a bladder, bladder.

1901
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:12,960
I know I missed a bladder.

1902
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:14,119
It's because people are faster than me

1903
01:42:14,119 --> 01:42:16,659
and I accidentally hit E instead of W.

1904
01:42:16,659 --> 01:42:20,489
Oh my goodness.

1905
01:42:20,489 --> 01:42:23,250
You want a fancy, what do you want?

1906
01:42:23,250 --> 01:42:26,739
All right, nerve cluster.

1907
01:42:26,739 --> 01:42:29,800
Ooh, bingo.

1908
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:31,039
Two eyeballs for the price of one,

1909
01:42:31,039 --> 01:42:33,970
thanks to my last hunting trip, 400.

1910
01:42:34,130 --> 01:42:36,409
Get out of here, fuck off.

1911
01:42:36,409 --> 01:42:37,810
Little squirrely fella thought

1912
01:42:37,810 --> 01:42:39,810
they could hide their pancreas from me.

1913
01:42:39,810 --> 01:42:41,250
Made sure it's real high condition.

1914
01:42:41,250 --> 01:42:45,789
600 bucks, yeah, I'll take it.

1915
01:42:45,789 --> 01:42:46,630
That's pretty good.

1916
01:42:46,630 --> 01:42:48,149
That's pretty good quality, too.

1917
01:42:48,149 --> 01:42:51,970
Oh my freaking God.

1918
01:42:51,970 --> 01:42:53,090
Did I hold it?

1919
01:42:53,090 --> 01:42:59,000
No, sell it now.

1920
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:03,170
Stomach and a shift wux.

1921
01:43:03,170 --> 01:43:04,130
I think I already have the stomach.

1922
01:43:04,130 --> 01:43:13,119
I do and I need a shift wux.

1923
01:43:13,119 --> 01:43:21,960
Shift wux, aw.

1924
01:43:21,960 --> 01:43:27,399
This is going up in value.

1925
01:43:27,399 --> 01:43:30,159
I just paid two grand on that trade.

1926
01:43:30,159 --> 01:43:31,560
Remember to please show your piss bottle.

1927
01:43:31,560 --> 01:43:38,750
I pee in the toilet like a human.

1928
01:43:38,750 --> 01:43:40,909
I have, okay.

1929
01:43:40,909 --> 01:43:44,470
What am I fulfilling here?

1930
01:43:44,470 --> 01:43:47,340
Let me do this one.

1931
01:43:47,340 --> 01:43:48,380
Mythic lung.

1932
01:43:48,380 --> 01:43:56,369
I need mythic lung and I need a shift wux.

1933
01:43:56,369 --> 01:43:57,289
Is that a shift wux?

1934
01:43:57,289 --> 01:44:00,640
Mythic, oh my God, I can't even read.

1935
01:44:00,640 --> 01:44:02,520
Mythic lung and a shift wux.

1936
01:44:02,520 --> 01:44:03,840
Got it, okay.

1937
01:44:05,640 --> 01:44:07,149
Thank you.

1938
01:44:07,149 --> 01:44:08,189
I need a mythic lung.

1939
01:44:08,189 --> 01:44:11,010
Let's take some more requests.

1940
01:44:11,010 --> 01:44:13,229
What's this one?

1941
01:44:13,229 --> 01:44:15,869
Rarity doesn't matter, get me a shard now.

1942
01:44:15,869 --> 01:44:20,680
Okay, you guys have terrible deals.

1943
01:44:20,680 --> 01:44:23,779
Need, what am I doing here?

1944
01:44:23,779 --> 01:44:28,140
Okay, shard, soul.

1945
01:44:28,140 --> 01:44:31,920
Shard, soul, mythic lung.

1946
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:33,760
Shard, soul, mythic lung.

1947
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:36,090
That's too expensive.

1948
01:44:36,090 --> 01:44:38,420
God, oh.

1949
01:44:38,420 --> 01:44:42,060
Mythic, the organ barge approaches.

1950
01:44:42,060 --> 01:44:43,619
Tomorrow ports across the galaxy

1951
01:44:43,619 --> 01:44:45,739
will drown in nerve clusters.

1952
01:44:45,739 --> 01:44:50,699
The market begins to whip itself into a frenzy.

1953
01:44:50,699 --> 01:44:55,199
Huh?

1954
01:44:55,199 --> 01:44:56,239
Huh?

1955
01:44:56,239 --> 01:45:02,939
Mythic lung.

1956
01:45:02,939 --> 01:45:07,289
Give me a lung, come on.

1957
01:45:07,289 --> 01:45:12,060
Mythic lung, mythic lung, what is this?

1958
01:45:12,060 --> 01:45:17,880
Mythic, nope.

1959
01:45:17,880 --> 01:45:19,310
I missed it?

1960
01:45:19,310 --> 01:45:20,149
No, I didn't.

1961
01:45:20,149 --> 01:45:23,270
This is rough.

1962
01:45:23,270 --> 01:45:28,840
It's a spleen, spleen, come on, where is it?

1963
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:37,680
Lung, common, common, common, rough.

1964
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:39,739
No one's buying today.

1965
01:45:39,739 --> 01:45:46,800
Sell nerve clusters, I don't have any.

1966
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:52,819
I'm looking for a mythic lung.

1967
01:45:52,819 --> 01:45:55,500
Damn.

1968
01:45:55,500 --> 01:45:57,420
Why would there be $3200 for a common lung?

1969
01:45:57,420 --> 01:46:01,970
Give me a break.

1970
01:46:01,970 --> 01:46:04,460
I don't think I'm gonna get it today.

1971
01:46:05,300 --> 01:46:08,520
This spleen is gonna plummet, sell it.

1972
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:18,579
I don't have, why?

1973
01:46:18,579 --> 01:46:19,420
Mythic.

1974
01:46:19,420 --> 01:46:20,260
Oh!

1975
01:46:24,289 --> 01:46:30,340
That was so much money.

1976
01:46:30,340 --> 01:46:34,600
Oh, fuck these guys.

1977
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:42,479
Ha, naughty creature, I don't care.

1978
01:46:42,479 --> 01:46:50,680
This is, I'm telling you, this isn't gonna play out.

1979
01:46:50,680 --> 01:46:51,760
My stock portfolio,

1980
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:56,319
maybe I should buy some more securities.

1981
01:46:56,319 --> 01:47:00,439
You have to influence the stock market.

1982
01:47:00,439 --> 01:47:03,600
Yeah, but I mean, what do you wanna do?

1983
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:04,920
Wait a minute.

1984
01:47:04,920 --> 01:47:06,159
Didn't they say that

1985
01:47:06,199 --> 01:47:09,239
something was gonna crash today, right?

1986
01:47:09,239 --> 01:47:12,079
What was it?

1987
01:47:12,079 --> 01:47:12,920
Something was gonna,

1988
01:47:12,920 --> 01:47:17,060
they said something was gonna crash today.

1989
01:47:17,060 --> 01:47:21,000
Nerves, okay, where's the nerves?

1990
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:22,560
Nerve clusters are gonna crash today.

1991
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:24,960
All right, so when the nerve clusters clash,

1992
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:31,800
I'm gonna buy a shitload of stock on the UTF.

1993
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:38,140
Why would people buy this?

1994
01:47:38,140 --> 01:47:40,260
So tomorrow, remind me to come back here

1995
01:47:40,260 --> 01:47:41,340
because we're buying,

1996
01:47:42,760 --> 01:47:45,590
buying the dip.

1997
01:47:45,590 --> 01:47:49,220
All right, let's go.

1998
01:47:49,220 --> 01:47:50,890
Aim it up front.

1999
01:47:50,890 --> 01:47:51,810
Enter, I'm entering.

2000
01:47:51,810 --> 01:47:53,850
The guy with all the TV ads, he's a bit visible,

2001
01:47:53,850 --> 01:47:55,329
but sure, I can take him out.

2002
01:47:55,329 --> 01:47:58,210
Just need my large rot cane up front.

2003
01:47:58,210 --> 01:48:01,180
Okay, large rot cane.

2004
01:48:01,180 --> 01:48:03,220
Soul, a new soul,

2005
01:48:03,220 --> 01:48:09,470
rot cane, soul, and a lung.

2006
01:48:09,470 --> 01:48:13,970
Large rot cane.

2007
01:48:13,970 --> 01:48:17,090
Warlord Artigan declares a temporary truce

2008
01:48:17,090 --> 01:48:18,890
in all territories occupied by his armies.

2009
01:48:18,890 --> 01:48:22,000
Organ traders react in outrage.

2010
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:23,359
Oh my goodness gracious,

2011
01:48:23,359 --> 01:48:24,479
the market just fucking tanked

2012
01:48:24,479 --> 01:48:27,350
and I can just get a bunch of cheap shit here.

2013
01:48:27,350 --> 01:48:28,189
I think I'm gonna,

2014
01:48:28,189 --> 01:48:29,789
so I just bought, all right.

2015
01:48:29,789 --> 01:48:35,989
All right, I'm gonna buy a bunch of cheap nerve clusters.

2016
01:48:36,829 --> 01:48:41,170
And this lung.

2017
01:48:41,170 --> 01:48:42,569
I need more space in my inventory.

2018
01:48:42,569 --> 01:48:43,409
What is this?

2019
01:48:43,409 --> 01:48:48,960
Get rid of it.

2020
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:50,119
Liver, I already have that.

2021
01:48:50,119 --> 01:48:53,520
Here you go.

2022
01:48:53,520 --> 01:49:02,079
You want a soul.

2023
01:49:02,079 --> 01:49:05,079
I'm buying low.

2024
01:49:05,079 --> 01:49:08,880
I need a soul though.

2025
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:13,960
Oh man, that was a good one.

2026
01:49:13,960 --> 01:49:15,920
These are, look at this, valuable.

2027
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:18,359
B plus 68 quality, 53, 45.

2028
01:49:18,359 --> 01:49:19,199
I mean, they're not great,

2029
01:49:19,199 --> 01:49:20,020
but like these will be,

2030
01:49:20,020 --> 01:49:24,550
this will go way higher tomorrow.

2031
01:49:24,550 --> 01:49:29,949
I need a soul.

2032
01:49:29,949 --> 01:49:36,420
Dude, somebody sell a soul to me, please.

2033
01:49:36,420 --> 01:49:41,380
I'll take that.

2034
01:49:41,380 --> 01:49:42,460
I know you're trying to make a profit,

2035
01:49:42,460 --> 01:49:43,739
but if you help me and some friends

2036
01:49:43,779 --> 01:49:46,380
undercut the price of nerve clusters,

2037
01:49:46,380 --> 01:49:52,109
it would let me treat a lot of people.

2038
01:49:52,109 --> 01:49:53,789
Sorry, I just bought like four of them.

2039
01:49:53,789 --> 01:49:57,930
I'm sorry.

2040
01:49:57,930 --> 01:50:06,720
Soul, soul.

2041
01:50:06,720 --> 01:50:10,199
Come on.

2042
01:50:10,199 --> 01:50:16,789
Shard, shards.

2043
01:50:16,789 --> 01:50:25,020
Maybe I should buy a shard and hold onto it.

2044
01:50:25,020 --> 01:50:26,680
Nobody's selling anything.

2045
01:50:26,680 --> 01:50:28,640
What is this?

2046
01:50:28,640 --> 01:50:31,300
I mean, see if I can get a heart,

2047
01:50:31,300 --> 01:50:33,920
heart or a soul.

2048
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:34,739
I'll take it.

2049
01:50:34,739 --> 01:50:36,479
I didn't make it at this point.

2050
01:50:36,479 --> 01:50:40,850
No, no, all right.

2051
01:50:40,850 --> 01:50:42,489
Oh, hell yeah.

2052
01:50:42,489 --> 01:50:46,170
Look at this shit.

2053
01:50:46,170 --> 01:50:52,279
What about my, oh, oh no.

2054
01:50:52,279 --> 01:50:57,800
No, oh no.

2055
01:50:57,800 --> 01:51:00,319
Ooh, ooh, that hurts.

2056
01:51:00,319 --> 01:51:08,189
That really hurts.

2057
01:51:08,189 --> 01:51:09,529
I'm gonna get my cost down.

2058
01:51:09,529 --> 01:51:20,270
I'm gonna get my cost average down.

2059
01:51:20,270 --> 01:51:21,109
I can look at all this.

2060
01:51:21,109 --> 01:51:29,840
I got all this cash coming up here.

2061
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:30,680
What?

2062
01:51:30,680 --> 01:51:32,079
No, I wanted to start the trading day.

2063
01:51:32,079 --> 01:51:32,920
What?

2064
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:34,039
I was just so confused.

2065
01:51:34,039 --> 01:51:36,359
I just sat there silently for five seconds.

2066
01:51:36,359 --> 01:51:43,449
What did I just do?

2067
01:51:43,449 --> 01:51:50,350
Jard, jard, heart.

2068
01:51:50,350 --> 01:51:51,189
Oh Jesus.

2069
01:51:51,189 --> 01:51:52,829
Okay, how much?

2070
01:51:52,829 --> 01:52:00,439
I need a soul, a shard and a heart.

2071
01:52:05,680 --> 01:52:07,539
Soul and a shard.

2072
01:52:07,539 --> 01:52:09,859
Ah, I can't afford it.

2073
01:52:09,859 --> 01:52:12,279
What?

2074
01:52:12,279 --> 01:52:14,479
That's a soul, I got it, I got it.

2075
01:52:14,479 --> 01:52:16,359
Oh my God, that's a huge return.

2076
01:52:16,359 --> 01:52:17,840
Thank God.

2077
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:18,680
Jard.

2078
01:52:24,380 --> 01:52:25,720
What do you want?

2079
01:52:25,720 --> 01:52:29,159
I want large rot cane.

2080
01:52:29,159 --> 01:52:30,239
I gotta get rid of this.

2081
01:52:30,239 --> 01:52:31,159
Large rot cane.

2082
01:52:31,159 --> 01:52:33,510
What else do you guys want?

2083
01:52:33,510 --> 01:52:36,770
Heart.

2084
01:52:36,770 --> 01:52:42,460
Heart and a large rot cane.

2085
01:52:42,460 --> 01:52:45,100
That's the heart.

2086
01:52:45,100 --> 01:52:46,020
Need a rot cane.

2087
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:50,800
Large rot cane, rot cane, rot cane, rot cane.

2088
01:52:50,800 --> 01:52:52,319
Any more requests?

2089
01:52:52,319 --> 01:52:53,899
Eyeball.

2090
01:52:53,899 --> 01:52:58,470
And you, fuck, outta here.

2091
01:52:58,470 --> 01:52:59,649
Eyeball.

2092
01:52:59,649 --> 01:53:00,489
Rot cane?

2093
01:53:00,489 --> 01:53:01,310
Is it large?

2094
01:53:01,310 --> 01:53:07,810
It's tiny.

2095
01:53:07,810 --> 01:53:09,010
Shipment of gallbladders arrives.

2096
01:53:09,010 --> 01:53:13,939
A regulator shudder at the market impacts to come.

2097
01:53:13,939 --> 01:53:15,100
Fuck you.

2098
01:53:15,100 --> 01:53:17,340
Oh no, they're so cheap.

2099
01:53:17,340 --> 01:53:20,199
I want them all.

2100
01:53:20,199 --> 01:53:21,800
I just bought the worst ones.

2101
01:53:21,800 --> 01:53:24,039
I bought the actually worst ones.

2102
01:53:24,039 --> 01:53:25,479
Sell them, sell them back.

2103
01:53:26,689 --> 01:53:28,329
Almond, mythic, mythic.

2104
01:53:28,329 --> 01:53:29,890
That one's a good quality.

2105
01:53:29,890 --> 01:53:36,420
Rare, large and rare.

2106
01:53:36,420 --> 01:53:38,930
Large, rare and large.

2107
01:53:38,930 --> 01:53:41,319
Mythic, but bad quality.

2108
01:53:41,319 --> 01:53:44,699
Rough, rough, rough, rough, rough,

2109
01:53:44,699 --> 01:53:45,899
rough, rough, rough, rough, rough.

2110
01:53:45,899 --> 01:53:49,010
I want mythic.

2111
01:53:49,010 --> 01:53:51,640
No, don't just flood myself.

2112
01:53:51,640 --> 01:53:53,079
I need to upgrade my cargo space

2113
01:53:53,079 --> 01:53:57,979
instead of putting $40,000 under the fucking stock market.

2114
01:53:57,979 --> 01:53:58,819
It's all right.

2115
01:53:58,819 --> 01:54:00,810
It's okay, we'll be fine.

2116
01:54:00,810 --> 01:54:02,989
I need a rot cane.

2117
01:54:02,989 --> 01:54:06,380
No, too big.

2118
01:54:06,380 --> 01:54:12,939
Average rot cane.

2119
01:54:12,939 --> 01:54:16,460
Are these gonna go up in value?

2120
01:54:16,460 --> 01:54:19,470
Oh no.

2121
01:54:19,470 --> 01:54:21,149
Average price paid, three.

2122
01:54:21,149 --> 01:54:29,890
See, I'm fine.

2123
01:54:29,890 --> 01:54:34,159
But look at this, I could buy some of this.

2124
01:54:34,159 --> 01:54:46,260
Oh, I want it so bad.

2125
01:54:46,260 --> 01:54:49,109
I want it so bad.

2126
01:54:49,109 --> 01:54:49,949
Is this live?

2127
01:54:49,949 --> 01:54:53,239
Yeah, this is twitch.tv, man.

2128
01:54:53,239 --> 01:54:54,239
I need cargo space.

2129
01:54:54,239 --> 01:54:56,760
All right, I'm gonna just make money.

2130
01:54:56,760 --> 01:54:58,199
I'm not gonna look at anything, just make money.

2131
01:54:58,199 --> 01:55:01,680
Oh my fucking God, I'm trying to start the trading day.

2132
01:55:01,680 --> 01:55:02,800
Not sell something.

2133
01:55:03,800 --> 01:55:06,079
$600 less than what I bought it for.

2134
01:55:11,880 --> 01:55:17,350
Kidney, kidneys.

2135
01:55:17,350 --> 01:55:24,250
Okay, kidneys, kidney, kidney, stomach, eyeball.

2136
01:55:24,250 --> 01:55:25,090
Kidney, kidney, stomach, eyeball.

2137
01:55:25,090 --> 01:55:25,930
Kidney, kidney, stomach, eyeball.

2138
01:55:25,930 --> 01:55:26,770
Kidney, kidney, stomach, eyeball.

2139
01:55:26,770 --> 01:55:29,029
Kidney, kidney, kidney.

2140
01:55:29,029 --> 01:55:29,869
Kidney, kidney, stomach, eyeball.

2141
01:55:29,869 --> 01:55:30,710
Kidney, kidney, stomach, eyeball.

2142
01:55:30,710 --> 01:55:31,550
Kidney, kidney, stomach, eyeball.

2143
01:55:31,550 --> 01:55:33,970
Kidney, kidney, stomach, eyeball.

2144
01:55:33,970 --> 01:55:50,739
Ooh, you need kidney, kidneys.

2145
01:55:50,739 --> 01:55:53,689
This is not large, kidney.

2146
01:55:53,689 --> 01:55:54,529
I need that.

2147
01:55:54,529 --> 01:55:58,090
Don't buy that, you fucking stupid, you goddamn mutt.

2148
01:55:58,130 --> 01:56:09,550
I don't want, eyeball.

2149
01:56:09,550 --> 01:56:27,020
Don't buy that, you dumb dog.

2150
01:56:27,020 --> 01:56:28,619
I need a, okay, let's fill this mug.

2151
01:56:28,619 --> 01:56:34,239
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what?

2152
01:56:34,239 --> 01:56:37,689
Stupid dog, you make me look bad.

2153
01:56:37,689 --> 01:56:39,739
Bugga, buga, buga, buga, buga.

2154
01:56:39,739 --> 01:56:40,979
In two days, ports across the galaxy

2155
01:56:40,979 --> 01:56:48,880
will be flooded with lungs.

2156
01:56:48,880 --> 01:56:52,720
Okay, eyeballs, all right.

2157
01:56:52,720 --> 01:56:56,069
Oh boy, what the hell is going on here?

2158
01:56:56,069 --> 01:57:01,800
What, oh, can I have one of these?

2159
01:57:01,800 --> 01:57:02,699
All right, what do I need?

2160
01:57:02,699 --> 01:57:07,000
I have 45 seconds.

2161
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:13,500
Shard, heart, heart, heart, heart, stomach, eyeball.

2162
01:57:17,010 --> 01:57:27,199
Oh my God, shut up.

2163
01:57:27,199 --> 01:57:32,340
God, God, God, God.

2164
01:57:32,340 --> 01:57:34,619
Drop the shift books that'll shrink organs

2165
01:57:34,619 --> 01:57:37,119
instead of growing them.

2166
01:57:37,119 --> 01:57:42,960
I don't have $4,000, dude.

2167
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:57,220
Shard, liver, shard, I need a shard and a liver.

2168
01:57:57,220 --> 01:57:58,659
Oh, no, you don't want a liver?

2169
01:57:58,659 --> 01:58:00,060
I thought lives depend on it.

2170
01:58:00,060 --> 01:58:07,300
I thought I said liver depends on it.

2171
01:58:07,300 --> 01:58:23,720
Dude, I need to buy this.

2172
01:58:23,720 --> 01:58:28,789
No more bullshit, how much, is this recovering yet?

2173
01:58:28,789 --> 01:58:35,260
I bought these for $2,1400, $800, oh, this is bad.

2174
01:58:35,260 --> 01:58:39,079
I still need a, I need a bladder and I need a shard.

2175
01:58:39,079 --> 01:58:46,529
Let's go, oh, I got it.

2176
01:58:46,529 --> 01:58:49,130
Bladder, I need to buy another bladder and a shard.

2177
01:58:49,130 --> 01:58:55,569
Fulfill this shit, shard, come on.

2178
01:58:55,569 --> 01:58:59,329
Laura, what do you want?

2179
01:58:59,329 --> 01:59:11,119
Heart, heart, heart, heart, heart, liver, heart, heart,

2180
01:59:11,279 --> 01:59:16,090
liver, shard, heart, heart, liver, shard, rot cane.

2181
01:59:16,090 --> 01:59:23,159
Heart, liver, shard, heart, heart, heart, liver, shard.

2182
01:59:23,159 --> 01:59:38,500
Oh, I can't fucking, come on, dude.

2183
01:59:38,500 --> 01:59:44,140
Oh, thank you, all right.

2184
01:59:44,140 --> 01:59:45,579
Heart, heart, heart, heart, heart, heart, heart,

2185
01:59:45,579 --> 01:59:48,880
heart, heart, heart, heart, heart, heart, liver, shard.

2186
01:59:48,880 --> 02:00:01,199
Relax, what am I doing?

2187
02:00:01,199 --> 02:00:05,659
How have I not had any, heart, heart, liver, shard?

2188
02:00:05,659 --> 02:00:07,220
You piece of shit, I needed that.

2189
02:00:07,220 --> 02:00:09,750
That was a large rot cane.

2190
02:00:09,750 --> 02:00:11,720
That's too much money.

2191
02:00:11,720 --> 02:00:14,319
I'm not spending $11,000 on this, come on, man.

2192
02:00:14,319 --> 02:00:18,869
Get out of here.

2193
02:00:18,869 --> 02:00:24,819
$16,000, what are you talking about?

2194
02:00:24,819 --> 02:00:29,739
Heart, heart, liver, shard, heart, heart, heart.

2195
02:00:29,739 --> 02:00:35,800
No, no, I need a shard.

2196
02:00:35,800 --> 02:00:39,300
I'm not leaving here till I get one.

2197
02:00:39,300 --> 02:00:45,439
Okay, that sucked, but it was at least I got it.

2198
02:00:45,439 --> 02:00:48,159
Now you need a liver.

2199
02:00:48,159 --> 02:00:58,720
Wait, now I need a heart.

2200
02:00:58,720 --> 02:01:06,789
Heart, come on, heart, come on, heart, come on,

2201
02:01:06,789 --> 02:01:08,750
heart, come on, oh.

2202
02:01:09,270 --> 02:01:12,430
I'm doing, I'm doing all right.

2203
02:01:12,430 --> 02:01:15,949
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

2204
02:01:20,399 --> 02:01:22,920
My average price, that's why you double down.

2205
02:01:22,920 --> 02:01:27,300
And now it's a $60,000, man, that's 100% profit.

2206
02:01:27,300 --> 02:01:29,649
I average this shit down.

2207
02:01:29,649 --> 02:01:33,380
After these, I bought it three.

2208
02:01:33,380 --> 02:01:37,319
Sell, I'll tell you what I'll do.

2209
02:01:37,319 --> 02:01:39,840
I'm gonna sell some, I'm not selling all.

2210
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:51,369
I'm not cashing out, no, not the whole thing.

2211
02:01:51,369 --> 02:01:54,029
I'm leaving what I put in.

2212
02:01:54,029 --> 02:01:58,779
I got 30 grand in here, I just took it, look at that.

2213
02:01:58,779 --> 02:02:02,090
Now let's go for it, bingo.

2214
02:02:02,090 --> 02:02:04,329
More spaces, more capacity.

2215
02:02:04,329 --> 02:02:06,970
25% slower decaying of the units

2216
02:02:06,970 --> 02:02:09,880
that are inside the refrigerator.

2217
02:02:09,880 --> 02:02:19,899
Nice, put it on, oh yeah, two more slots.

2218
02:02:19,899 --> 02:02:24,109
This is 40 grand, this is 10 slots.

2219
02:02:24,109 --> 02:02:32,550
Ooh, okay, so if I do this, then I can hold onto some stuff.

2220
02:02:32,550 --> 02:02:34,390
You hit the cap, they can't go higher.

2221
02:02:34,390 --> 02:02:38,060
What do you mean cap?

2222
02:02:38,060 --> 02:02:40,659
Sell all, price is at the max, dude.

2223
02:02:40,659 --> 02:02:44,359
What are you talking about?

2224
02:02:44,359 --> 02:02:53,789
Oh, I did not understand what I was looking at.

2225
02:02:53,789 --> 02:02:59,130
This is the maximum it can possibly be?

2226
02:02:59,130 --> 02:03:05,579
I thought this was just the range that it's in right now.

2227
02:03:05,579 --> 02:03:07,180
That is the maximum.

2228
02:03:09,170 --> 02:03:11,289
I thought this was just a sort of range

2229
02:03:11,289 --> 02:03:17,199
that this is currently in.

2230
02:03:17,199 --> 02:03:19,439
I thought I saw nine, yeah, I think,

2231
02:03:19,439 --> 02:03:22,020
wait, you guys, I don't think you guys are right.

2232
02:03:22,020 --> 02:03:24,020
It was seven before, they're bullshitting you.

2233
02:03:24,020 --> 02:03:26,560
Yeah, yeah, guys, you don't know what you're talking about.

2234
02:03:26,560 --> 02:03:29,819
Yeah, you have no idea what you're talking about.

2235
02:03:29,859 --> 02:03:31,220
One guy, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2236
02:03:31,220 --> 02:03:34,329
Well, you know, you didn't know what you're talking about.

2237
02:03:34,329 --> 02:03:37,000
You don't know what you're talking about.

2238
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:38,479
I could come back then.

2239
02:03:38,479 --> 02:03:39,479
Why would you come back then?

2240
02:03:39,479 --> 02:03:42,329
We'll be closed.

2241
02:03:42,329 --> 02:03:49,729
All right, let's go.

2242
02:03:50,810 --> 02:03:55,930
I don't care, shard, kidney, liver.

2243
02:03:55,930 --> 02:03:57,609
Okay, let's fulfill this shit.

2244
02:03:57,609 --> 02:03:58,590
Okay, shard, liver.

2245
02:03:58,590 --> 02:04:00,630
Oh, God damn it, all these lungs.

2246
02:04:04,119 --> 02:04:09,029
They're too expensive.

2247
02:04:09,029 --> 02:04:12,079
That's your lucky liver.

2248
02:04:12,079 --> 02:04:13,479
That's like the best fucking character.

2249
02:04:13,479 --> 02:04:15,720
That's the best movie ever made, I think.

2250
02:04:15,720 --> 02:04:18,529
Fine Ghostbusters.

2251
02:04:18,529 --> 02:04:19,810
I don't wanna buy any of these.

2252
02:04:19,810 --> 02:04:23,409
Maybe they're all rough, common, common, rough.

2253
02:04:23,409 --> 02:04:25,670
This one's rare, but too expensive.

2254
02:04:25,670 --> 02:04:31,550
No, this would be somebody else's problem.

2255
02:04:31,550 --> 02:04:34,449
Stomach, I need a shard.

2256
02:04:34,449 --> 02:04:35,529
This is large raw cane.

2257
02:04:35,529 --> 02:04:38,310
I'm not gonna spend that much money.

2258
02:04:38,310 --> 02:04:41,079
What do you guys all want?

2259
02:04:41,079 --> 02:04:45,310
Kidneys, shards, kidney, shard, heart, liver.

2260
02:04:45,310 --> 02:04:47,510
Kidneys, shard, heart, liver.

2261
02:04:47,510 --> 02:04:55,529
Kidney, ugh, fine, no.

2262
02:04:55,529 --> 02:05:06,500
Kidneys, shard, heart, liver.

2263
02:05:06,539 --> 02:05:07,899
That's a few of them, at least.

2264
02:05:07,899 --> 02:05:10,140
1,200, I'll take it.

2265
02:05:10,140 --> 02:05:14,479
I need a heart and a liver.

2266
02:05:14,479 --> 02:05:17,800
Heart, I need hearts, man.

2267
02:05:17,800 --> 02:05:21,279
And go, all right, got it.

2268
02:05:21,279 --> 02:05:22,949
What?

2269
02:05:22,949 --> 02:05:24,789
I heart, a liver, oh, and a stomach.

2270
02:05:24,789 --> 02:05:30,689
I didn't read the second part.

2271
02:05:30,689 --> 02:05:34,109
I bought the wrong one.

2272
02:05:34,109 --> 02:05:38,529
I'm now a professional, all right.

2273
02:05:38,529 --> 02:05:39,529
Holy shit, eight grand?

2274
02:05:39,529 --> 02:05:41,109
I have emotions and they suck.

2275
02:05:41,109 --> 02:05:45,369
Get me a new brain.

2276
02:05:45,369 --> 02:05:47,369
I started screaming and I did not stop

2277
02:05:47,369 --> 02:05:48,770
and now we're crying, new lungs.

2278
02:05:48,770 --> 02:05:51,550
This is relatable, all right.

2279
02:05:51,550 --> 02:05:52,390
All right, all right, all right, all right,

2280
02:05:52,550 --> 02:05:56,609
right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right,

2281
02:05:56,609 --> 02:05:58,199
right, right, right, right.

2282
02:05:58,199 --> 02:06:06,069
Do I need, okay, I need, I'll do it tomorrow.

2283
02:06:06,069 --> 02:06:12,310
I can't do it, my brain's too slow right now.

2284
02:06:13,270 --> 02:06:16,760
Who are you?

2285
02:06:16,760 --> 02:06:22,680
I'll do it tomorrow.

2286
02:06:22,680 --> 02:06:24,960
This is why I wanted to buy into that nerve index.

2287
02:06:24,960 --> 02:06:34,680
Look at this, that's a 100% increase.

2288
02:06:34,680 --> 02:06:45,640
And it's not even a bad time to buy it, I don't think.

2289
02:06:45,640 --> 02:06:51,960
Liver, bladder, and kidney, okay.

2290
02:06:51,960 --> 02:07:00,140
Don't FOMO, the valve nerve index

2291
02:07:00,140 --> 02:07:05,539
is what you're gonna play Half-Life 3 on.

2292
02:07:06,020 --> 02:07:07,619
I need good lungs.

2293
02:07:07,619 --> 02:07:08,859
Let me fulfill these ones first

2294
02:07:08,859 --> 02:07:10,899
because I'm gonna get so caught up here.

2295
02:07:14,029 --> 02:07:21,920
Lungs, lung, brain, lung, brain, shard,

2296
02:07:22,079 --> 02:07:25,079
rot cane, lung, brain, shard.

2297
02:07:25,079 --> 02:07:30,760
Whoa, lung, brain, shard.

2298
02:07:30,760 --> 02:07:34,659
Brains are gonna be cheap.

2299
02:07:34,659 --> 02:07:36,640
Lung, brain, shard, I got the shard.

2300
02:07:36,640 --> 02:07:42,449
Lung, brain, lung, that's, that, lungs are awful.

2301
02:07:42,850 --> 02:07:49,539
Lung, brain, lymph, lung, brain.

2302
02:07:50,420 --> 02:08:01,399
Oh, my eyes, okay, I'm buying that.

2303
02:08:01,399 --> 02:08:05,520
I need to buy a brain, what is that?

2304
02:08:05,520 --> 02:08:14,239
Shard, wait, I didn't even need that.

2305
02:08:14,239 --> 02:08:18,720
Okay, all right, I need a brain and lungs.

2306
02:08:18,720 --> 02:08:23,050
Brain, lungs, give me some lungs.

2307
02:08:23,050 --> 02:08:26,000
That's a brain right there, dude.

2308
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:34,890
I bought the fucking expensive one, idiot.

2309
02:08:34,890 --> 02:08:44,329
Give me a shitty pair of lungs, shitty lungs.

2310
02:08:44,329 --> 02:08:47,930
You need to diversify, you're too focused in biotech.

2311
02:08:48,090 --> 02:08:58,380
I need, any lungs will do, please.

2312
02:08:58,380 --> 02:09:02,840
Any lungs will do.

2313
02:09:02,840 --> 02:09:04,600
Ooh, I got it, how would you,

2314
02:09:04,600 --> 02:09:09,439
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, how would you pay for this?

2315
02:09:09,439 --> 02:09:14,159
Oh, oh, oh, I thought it was 1,300, no, no.

2316
02:09:14,159 --> 02:09:22,199
Tell it back immediately, I'll buy a cheaper one.

2317
02:09:22,199 --> 02:09:23,439
I thought that was way cheaper.

2318
02:09:23,439 --> 02:09:25,880
A lung about, okay, I need lungs.

2319
02:09:25,880 --> 02:09:29,439
No, you stupid game, it's a great game.

2320
02:09:29,439 --> 02:09:32,880
Lungs, I hit E instead of W, it's my own fault.

2321
02:09:48,880 --> 02:09:54,079
Need to buy nerve agent.

2322
02:09:54,079 --> 02:09:57,289
I need to get rid of all this junk.

2323
02:09:57,289 --> 02:09:58,210
How much did I buy this for?

2324
02:09:58,210 --> 02:10:04,590
All right, I'm just like, I made money on it.

2325
02:10:04,590 --> 02:10:07,970
This is expensive, I'm losing a little bit on here.

2326
02:10:07,970 --> 02:10:11,920
People need this shit though, it comes in all the time.

2327
02:10:11,920 --> 02:10:15,439
Let's go.

2328
02:10:15,439 --> 02:10:19,789
All right, lungs, lungs and a large rock cane.

2329
02:10:19,789 --> 02:10:23,789
Good lungs that are over 54.

2330
02:10:23,789 --> 02:10:27,329
That brain is cheap and I'm afraid to pull the trigger on it.

2331
02:10:27,329 --> 02:10:29,649
Spleens will, the market price plummets

2332
02:10:29,649 --> 02:10:30,850
in response to Spleens.

2333
02:10:32,319 --> 02:10:40,939
Got it, I didn't even see what it was.

2334
02:10:40,939 --> 02:10:45,159
It wasn't good enough.

2335
02:10:45,159 --> 02:10:47,689
Can I just buy up all the Spleens?

2336
02:10:47,689 --> 02:10:51,390
At least the expensive ones.

2337
02:10:51,390 --> 02:10:54,329
All right, I'm out of space.

2338
02:10:54,329 --> 02:10:58,880
This thing's a piece of shit, get rid of it.

2339
02:10:58,880 --> 02:11:12,359
Lung above 54, didn't I just have one?

2340
02:11:12,359 --> 02:11:17,670
I'm just buying up all the Spleens, fuck it.

2341
02:11:17,670 --> 02:11:23,789
Never degrades, increases condition of nearby organs.

2342
02:11:23,789 --> 02:11:27,420
Are you serious?

2343
02:11:27,420 --> 02:11:34,439
Can I move it around?

2344
02:11:34,439 --> 02:11:35,800
All right, I'm getting overwhelmed.

2345
02:11:35,800 --> 02:11:37,159
Lung above 54.

2346
02:11:39,199 --> 02:11:45,960
Ah, brain above 68 and large rock cane.

2347
02:11:49,199 --> 02:11:59,029
Okay, brain above 68, no.

2348
02:11:59,029 --> 02:11:59,909
Spleens are about to be cheap.

2349
02:11:59,909 --> 02:12:02,390
Oh, they just did, they are cheap now.

2350
02:12:02,390 --> 02:12:06,619
I bought a bunch of them.

2351
02:12:06,619 --> 02:12:13,010
I'm running out of time.

2352
02:12:13,010 --> 02:12:17,050
Brain, no.

2353
02:12:17,050 --> 02:12:19,649
Lung 79, do I need that?

2354
02:12:19,649 --> 02:12:21,750
What?

2355
02:12:21,750 --> 02:12:22,789
Yeah, I need that.

2356
02:12:22,789 --> 02:12:23,989
Yeah, I need that.

2357
02:12:23,989 --> 02:12:28,600
Yeah, I need that.

2358
02:12:28,600 --> 02:12:29,960
Oh, come on.

2359
02:12:29,960 --> 02:12:31,520
Okay, good, good, good, good, good, got it.

2360
02:12:31,520 --> 02:12:33,640
Nice, hell yeah.

2361
02:12:33,640 --> 02:12:36,430
All right, let's get some more requests in here.

2362
02:12:36,430 --> 02:12:39,960
Liver under 26.

2363
02:12:39,960 --> 02:12:44,850
I need a heart and a pancreas.

2364
02:12:44,850 --> 02:12:51,100
I might actually have some of that already, I do.

2365
02:12:51,100 --> 02:12:52,930
All right, market.

2366
02:12:52,930 --> 02:12:56,569
Get up there.

2367
02:12:56,569 --> 02:12:57,770
Am I in my prime yet?

2368
02:12:57,770 --> 02:13:03,949
I don't think so.

2369
02:13:03,949 --> 02:13:07,000
When is the human skin market gonna open?

2370
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:12,979
I don't know.

2371
02:13:12,979 --> 02:13:16,329
We can almost do this one.

2372
02:13:16,329 --> 02:13:19,850
All right, so Spleens are cheap as hell right now.

2373
02:13:19,850 --> 02:13:20,890
And this increases the quality

2374
02:13:20,890 --> 02:13:22,529
of everything around it, right?

2375
02:13:22,529 --> 02:13:25,210
Now this does.

2376
02:13:25,210 --> 02:13:26,090
How far does that reach?

2377
02:13:26,090 --> 02:13:29,079
I feel like this is a good idea.

2378
02:13:29,159 --> 02:13:31,229
Nice kidney here.

2379
02:13:31,229 --> 02:13:37,739
Got some valuable Spleens.

2380
02:13:37,739 --> 02:13:39,100
Buy Spleens stock.

2381
02:13:39,100 --> 02:13:51,170
Now that's cooking with gas.

2382
02:13:51,170 --> 02:14:05,199
Oh, I almost just tried to buy $32,000 worth.

2383
02:14:05,199 --> 02:14:07,340
All right, 10 grand, I'll do 10.

2384
02:14:07,340 --> 02:14:16,399
I'm not going all in.

2385
02:14:16,399 --> 02:14:18,729
Nerve cluster, all right.

2386
02:14:18,729 --> 02:14:19,930
I gotta get rid of these two.

2387
02:14:19,930 --> 02:14:27,159
Now, brain over 68 and a large rot cane.

2388
02:14:27,159 --> 02:14:29,159
Oh, shit.

2389
02:14:29,159 --> 02:14:32,260
Brain over 68.

2390
02:14:32,260 --> 02:14:34,859
Brain over 68, cheap too, come on.

2391
02:14:36,289 --> 02:14:37,970
Brain over 68, that's, no.

2392
02:14:45,560 --> 02:14:47,479
Large rot cane, yeah.

2393
02:14:50,920 --> 02:15:03,689
Now I need another rot cane.

2394
02:15:03,689 --> 02:15:07,069
Come on, what about my shit here?

2395
02:15:07,069 --> 02:15:09,479
They're going up in value.

2396
02:15:09,479 --> 02:15:11,960
This is pretty good.

2397
02:15:11,960 --> 02:15:15,479
Still need a rot cane.

2398
02:15:15,479 --> 02:15:22,250
Rough quality, no thanks.

2399
02:15:22,250 --> 02:15:28,579
Rot cane, valuable but terrible condition.

2400
02:15:28,579 --> 02:15:31,239
Terrible condition, just terrible.

2401
02:15:31,239 --> 02:15:37,880
Awful, these are all such junk.

2402
02:15:37,920 --> 02:15:40,930
Terrible, sell low, buy high.

2403
02:15:40,930 --> 02:15:48,520
Just awful, just terrible condition.

2404
02:15:48,520 --> 02:15:51,140
It's common, just awful.

2405
02:15:51,140 --> 02:15:55,770
Ooh, aw.

2406
02:15:55,770 --> 02:16:00,439
All right, I need some, anybody want a brain?

2407
02:16:00,439 --> 02:16:03,399
I still need rot canes and I need a pancreas.

2408
02:16:03,399 --> 02:16:09,609
Rot cane, pancreas and a liver under 36.

2409
02:16:09,609 --> 02:16:13,140
Can I just see a pancreas?

2410
02:16:13,140 --> 02:16:24,270
Pancreas, dick, come on.

2411
02:16:24,270 --> 02:16:32,920
Rot cane, 80 but, okay, that's a return.

2412
02:16:32,920 --> 02:16:34,430
That's a return.

2413
02:16:34,430 --> 02:16:35,510
I mean, it's a terrible return

2414
02:16:36,069 --> 02:16:43,110
No, it's not worth it.

2415
02:16:43,110 --> 02:16:46,889
I'll hold.

2416
02:16:46,889 --> 02:16:48,290
Here we go.

2417
02:16:48,290 --> 02:16:53,440
Of 21% today.

2418
02:16:53,440 --> 02:17:02,000
Damn it.

2419
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:03,120
What's this person say?

2420
02:17:03,120 --> 02:17:05,459
Hey Jerma, I like to watch your streams

2421
02:17:05,459 --> 02:17:07,020
while I run and lift at the gym.

2422
02:17:07,020 --> 02:17:08,500
The games are pretty engaging

2423
02:17:08,500 --> 02:17:10,940
and your recycled jokes always get me pumped up.

2424
02:17:12,379 --> 02:17:21,600
Please play Doki, I'm never gonna play that game.

2425
02:17:21,600 --> 02:17:24,159
All right, do I sell the spleen stock?

2426
02:17:24,159 --> 02:17:26,239
Just take the return here, the 20%.

2427
02:17:26,239 --> 02:17:28,639
Just let it ride and just sell it 600.

2428
02:17:28,639 --> 02:17:36,850
Speed, oh my God.

2429
02:17:36,850 --> 02:17:39,610
The phantom buyer, legend of the trading community.

2430
02:17:39,610 --> 02:17:42,049
Hailing from urgent, origins unknown.

2431
02:17:42,049 --> 02:17:43,770
Browses fast and buys faster.

2432
02:17:43,770 --> 02:17:45,559
They're a menace.

2433
02:17:45,559 --> 02:17:47,479
I'm not gonna pay $8,000.

2434
02:17:47,479 --> 02:17:51,639
That's too much.

2435
02:17:51,639 --> 02:17:54,799
Shit.

2436
02:17:54,799 --> 02:17:57,319
The brain stock because of the market overload.

2437
02:17:57,319 --> 02:17:58,159
Not a bad idea.

2438
02:18:11,569 --> 02:18:19,530
I don't have enough money.

2439
02:18:19,530 --> 02:18:24,139
Pancreas and rot cane, let's go.

2440
02:18:24,139 --> 02:18:28,719
Market quakes if you're a large shipment of lungs.

2441
02:18:28,719 --> 02:18:30,479
I like need them.

2442
02:18:30,479 --> 02:18:32,000
You always need these.

2443
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,450
I'm gonna buy the cheap ones.

2444
02:18:35,290 --> 02:18:36,530
Just scavenged like a little vulture

2445
02:18:36,530 --> 02:18:43,270
and just buy the crappy, cheap, terrible ones.

2446
02:18:43,270 --> 02:18:52,000
Yeah, 1,500, 1,600, just junk.

2447
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:53,200
The shard is pretty good.

2448
02:18:53,200 --> 02:18:54,479
I think I'm gonna get rid of the spleens.

2449
02:18:54,479 --> 02:19:01,069
I have a return on all of them.

2450
02:19:01,069 --> 02:19:08,360
Oh, heart, heart, lung.

2451
02:19:08,360 --> 02:19:09,200
Ooh, hurry.

2452
02:19:14,879 --> 02:19:17,290
I have the shard.

2453
02:19:17,290 --> 02:19:18,889
I don't have the lung.

2454
02:19:18,889 --> 02:19:22,440
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.

2455
02:19:22,440 --> 02:19:24,799
Oh yeah.

2456
02:19:24,799 --> 02:19:28,959
Heart, a heart and a pancreas.

2457
02:19:28,959 --> 02:19:37,200
Oh, look at me just flooding the market.

2458
02:19:38,120 --> 02:19:45,870
Somebody needs that.

2459
02:19:45,870 --> 02:19:48,559
And let me read the heart, two hearts.

2460
02:19:48,559 --> 02:19:50,760
Heart, heart, pancreas.

2461
02:19:50,760 --> 02:19:52,479
Heart, heart, rot cane, pancreas.

2462
02:19:52,479 --> 02:19:55,719
Heart, heart, pancreas, pancreas, rot cane.

2463
02:19:55,719 --> 02:19:58,719
Heart, heart, pancreas, pancreas, rot cane.

2464
02:19:58,719 --> 02:20:01,239
Heart, heart, pancreas, pancreas, rot cane.

2465
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,159
Heart, pancreas, pancreas, rot cane.

2466
02:20:06,479 --> 02:20:09,079
Heart, heart, pancreas, pancreas, rot cane.

2467
02:20:11,229 --> 02:20:15,639
Pancreas, pancreas, rot cane.

2468
02:20:15,639 --> 02:20:18,920
Pancreas, rot cane.

2469
02:20:18,920 --> 02:20:20,559
Pancreas, pancreas, rot cane.

2470
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:25,200
Heart, heart, pancreas, pancreas, rot cane.

2471
02:20:28,979 --> 02:20:34,569
Heart, wha!

2472
02:20:34,569 --> 02:20:35,770
Pancreas, pancreas.

2473
02:20:35,770 --> 02:20:37,159
Do I get it?

2474
02:20:37,159 --> 02:20:38,000
Oh, hell yeah.

2475
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,239
Look at that money flying.

2476
02:20:47,959 --> 02:20:56,260
Ooh, shard, brain, shard and brain.

2477
02:20:56,260 --> 02:20:58,040
Oh, fuck.

2478
02:20:58,040 --> 02:21:04,559
Sorry.

2479
02:21:04,559 --> 02:21:05,959
I think I'm gonna get, yeah.

2480
02:21:05,959 --> 02:21:13,059
I'm scared about this bottoming out again.

2481
02:21:13,059 --> 02:21:16,889
Why won't this move?

2482
02:21:16,889 --> 02:21:19,399
Yeah, I'm selling.

2483
02:21:19,399 --> 02:21:23,739
I'm selling everything.

2484
02:21:23,780 --> 02:21:25,860
I'm just completely cleaning out here.

2485
02:21:25,860 --> 02:21:31,420
I need the money.

2486
02:21:31,420 --> 02:21:42,600
Remember, you used to be cool.

2487
02:21:42,600 --> 02:21:44,079
I need that, listen to me.

2488
02:21:44,079 --> 02:21:44,920
Do you hear that?

2489
02:21:44,920 --> 02:21:45,879
It was always, it was getting there.

2490
02:21:45,879 --> 02:21:49,649
I was trying to make it happen.

2491
02:21:49,649 --> 02:21:55,479
I need $40,000 to get the upgrade.

2492
02:21:55,479 --> 02:21:56,360
There was nothing in that cup.

2493
02:21:56,360 --> 02:22:00,200
You just pretended to drink.

2494
02:22:00,200 --> 02:22:01,680
I'm an entertainer.

2495
02:22:01,680 --> 02:22:03,879
So I need to, like, if I'm gonna have to pretend

2496
02:22:03,879 --> 02:22:05,319
to do stuff to entertain you,

2497
02:22:05,319 --> 02:22:06,559
like I pretended to drink.

2498
02:22:06,559 --> 02:22:07,680
Yeah, I did.

2499
02:22:07,680 --> 02:22:10,639
But I'm an entertainer.

2500
02:22:10,639 --> 02:22:13,100
It's my job, right?

2501
02:22:13,100 --> 02:22:15,100
I'm gonna pretend to like slurp drinks and stuff

2502
02:22:15,100 --> 02:22:23,639
and people think it's funny.

2503
02:22:23,639 --> 02:22:24,719
What a theater kid.

2504
02:22:27,549 --> 02:22:33,010
Okay, let me, there's a lot of money here on the line.

2505
02:22:33,010 --> 02:22:39,340
Brain, shard, pancreas.

2506
02:22:39,340 --> 02:22:45,010
Brain, shard, pancreas, bad liver.

2507
02:22:45,010 --> 02:22:49,940
Brain, shard, pancreas, bad liver, got it?

2508
02:22:49,940 --> 02:22:51,540
Brain, shard, pancreas.

2509
02:22:51,540 --> 02:22:54,159
Oh, that was expensive.

2510
02:22:54,159 --> 02:22:55,719
Oh, that was expensive.

2511
02:22:55,719 --> 02:22:57,559
Brain, shard, pancreas, liver.

2512
02:22:57,559 --> 02:23:06,819
Brain, I need a brain.

2513
02:23:06,819 --> 02:23:11,860
Lung, kidney.

2514
02:23:11,860 --> 02:23:14,659
I slept on my side yesterday and now my kidney hurts.

2515
02:23:14,819 --> 02:23:16,850
Dying.

2516
02:23:16,850 --> 02:23:18,250
Oh boy, rot cane.

2517
02:23:18,250 --> 02:23:22,110
All right, let's take a look.

2518
02:23:22,110 --> 02:23:22,950
Here we go.

2519
02:23:22,950 --> 02:23:25,090
I gotta do these like nursery rhymes.

2520
02:23:25,090 --> 02:23:30,739
Rot cane, rot cane, kidney.

2521
02:23:30,739 --> 02:23:34,920
Kidney, kidney, rot cane.

2522
02:23:34,920 --> 02:23:36,280
Kidney, kidney, rot cane.

2523
02:23:36,280 --> 02:23:40,159
Lung, brain.

2524
02:23:40,159 --> 02:23:43,079
Kidney, kidney, rot, cane, brain.

2525
02:23:43,079 --> 02:23:45,440
Kidney, kidney, rot, cane, brain.

2526
02:23:45,440 --> 02:23:47,950
Kidney, kidney, rot, cane, brain.

2527
02:23:47,950 --> 02:23:50,430
Kidney, kidney, rot, cane, brain.

2528
02:23:50,430 --> 02:23:52,629
Kidney, kidney, rot, cane, brain.

2529
02:23:52,629 --> 02:23:53,790
Rot, cane, brain.

2530
02:23:53,790 --> 02:23:55,030
Rot, cane, brain.

2531
02:23:55,030 --> 02:23:59,829
Rot, brain, brain, brain, brain, brain, brain, brain, brain,

2532
02:23:59,829 --> 02:24:01,989
brain, brain, brain, brain.

2533
02:24:01,989 --> 02:24:02,829
That's all I need.

2534
02:24:07,239 --> 02:24:08,520
Now what?

2535
02:24:08,520 --> 02:24:11,440
18,000.

2536
02:24:11,440 --> 02:24:14,399
I think I can learn them out with four souls

2537
02:24:14,399 --> 02:24:16,639
at wholesale prices, my treat.

2538
02:24:16,639 --> 02:24:19,040
Four souls.

2539
02:24:19,040 --> 02:24:22,940
I'll give you 200 dollars for that liver, shard.

2540
02:24:22,940 --> 02:24:27,069
All right, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2541
02:24:27,069 --> 02:24:31,510
I need a new rhyme.

2542
02:24:31,510 --> 02:24:40,049
Lungs, lung, shard, lip.

2543
02:24:40,049 --> 02:24:41,770
Universe-wide strike for better labor conditions.

2544
02:24:41,770 --> 02:24:44,700
Organ barges halt mid-delivery.

2545
02:24:44,700 --> 02:24:46,870
Huh?

2546
02:24:46,870 --> 02:24:49,040
I'm trying to make a song up.

2547
02:24:49,040 --> 02:24:57,049
Lung, lung, shard, lung, shard, liver.

2548
02:24:57,049 --> 02:25:02,139
Lung, shard, liver, four souls.

2549
02:25:02,139 --> 02:25:06,059
Lung, shard, liver, four souls with a brain.

2550
02:25:06,059 --> 02:25:10,079
Lung, shard, liver, four souls with a brain.

2551
02:25:10,079 --> 02:25:12,840
Lung, shard, liver, four souls.

2552
02:25:12,840 --> 02:25:24,920
Lung, shard, liver, so.

2553
02:25:24,920 --> 02:25:25,959
I got a lot of money.

2554
02:25:26,959 --> 02:25:34,940
I would hate to be behind this guy in the grocery store.

2555
02:25:41,379 --> 02:25:43,219
Just walking around like,

2556
02:25:43,219 --> 02:25:48,959
milk, eggs, butter, peanut butter.

2557
02:25:48,959 --> 02:25:53,159
Almonds, Doritos, milk, butter, peanut butter.

2558
02:25:53,159 --> 02:26:00,120
I would be like, this guy's fucking crazy.

2559
02:26:00,120 --> 02:26:06,120
Toilet paper, toilet paper, paper towels, paper plates.

2560
02:26:06,120 --> 02:26:14,799
Milk, eggs, butter, peanut butter.

2561
02:26:14,799 --> 02:26:19,930
Oh, yay, yay.

2562
02:26:19,930 --> 02:26:21,129
Oh, great commentary.

2563
02:26:24,690 --> 02:26:29,590
Coffee, Cheetos, chicken.

2564
02:26:29,590 --> 02:26:30,590
I don't think I'd want to do that

2565
02:26:30,590 --> 02:26:37,729
because sometimes my grocery list is kind of gross.

2566
02:26:37,729 --> 02:26:40,290
Ground beef, dog treats.

2567
02:26:40,290 --> 02:26:41,850
Ground beef, dog treats.

2568
02:26:41,850 --> 02:26:44,430
Ground beef, dog treats.

2569
02:26:44,430 --> 02:26:52,959
You're like, what is this guy making?

2570
02:26:52,959 --> 02:26:58,139
Cottage cheese, ground beef, raw chicken, dog treats.

2571
02:26:58,139 --> 02:27:04,299
Ugh.

2572
02:27:04,299 --> 02:27:07,860
I can afford the new upgrade.

2573
02:27:07,860 --> 02:27:22,040
Should have held, should have held it.

2574
02:27:22,040 --> 02:27:23,520
It's gonna die, hey, hey.

2575
02:27:23,520 --> 02:27:29,750
It's gonna double bottom right here.

2576
02:27:29,750 --> 02:27:31,069
Buying this one.

2577
02:27:31,069 --> 02:27:32,920
All right, bang.

2578
02:27:32,920 --> 02:27:35,000
This is 10 capacity

2579
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:37,969
and no longer nothing corrodes in here anymore.

2580
02:27:37,969 --> 02:27:46,270
Oh yeah.

2581
02:27:46,270 --> 02:27:47,469
I should probably buy, hold on.

2582
02:27:47,469 --> 02:27:48,629
Something else tanked.

2583
02:27:48,629 --> 02:27:49,590
What tanked?

2584
02:27:49,590 --> 02:27:52,319
Everything.

2585
02:27:52,319 --> 02:27:53,799
What tanked the most?

2586
02:27:53,799 --> 02:28:02,479
Kendixes?

2587
02:28:02,479 --> 02:28:04,600
Oh, the mark is just dumped.

2588
02:28:04,600 --> 02:28:06,110
It's all right.

2589
02:28:06,110 --> 02:28:07,110
Strike tanked everything.

2590
02:28:07,110 --> 02:28:14,149
All right, okay, okay, okay.

2591
02:28:14,149 --> 02:28:19,239
Changes surrounding organs in the process.

2592
02:28:19,239 --> 02:28:21,729
I have, I need four souls.

2593
02:28:21,729 --> 02:28:24,290
That's a lot.

2594
02:28:24,290 --> 02:28:27,420
What's this one?

2595
02:28:27,420 --> 02:28:28,860
Loaning lab may have been lying to me.

2596
02:28:28,860 --> 02:28:30,739
I think they want to own the organ trade.

2597
02:28:30,739 --> 02:28:32,260
Send me a shard.

2598
02:28:32,260 --> 02:28:34,760
All right, four souls and a shard.

2599
02:28:34,760 --> 02:28:40,889
Go.

2600
02:28:40,889 --> 02:28:44,659
Soul, I gotta stop taking the ones that are souls.

2601
02:28:44,659 --> 02:28:45,540
Looked through my hunting traps

2602
02:28:45,540 --> 02:28:47,620
and found a prime nerve cluster 2400.

2603
02:28:47,620 --> 02:28:48,459
Sure, I'll take it.

2604
02:28:48,459 --> 02:28:52,180
What does it look like?

2605
02:28:52,180 --> 02:28:53,700
Ooh, I can already, 3500?

2606
02:28:53,700 --> 02:28:54,540
I'll take it.

2607
02:28:54,540 --> 02:28:56,770
Thank you.

2608
02:28:56,770 --> 02:28:58,649
All right, I need some more.

2609
02:28:58,649 --> 02:29:04,850
All right.

2610
02:29:04,850 --> 02:29:05,690
Do I already have any of these?

2611
02:29:05,690 --> 02:29:07,559
I got this one already.

2612
02:29:07,600 --> 02:29:08,760
Here's your soul.

2613
02:29:08,760 --> 02:29:13,079
Thanks for the 4000 bucks.

2614
02:29:13,079 --> 02:29:14,360
Okay.

2615
02:29:15,239 --> 02:29:16,239
Go.

2616
02:29:16,239 --> 02:29:17,239
I'll take that one too.

2617
02:29:17,239 --> 02:29:22,239
And I'll take that one.

2618
02:29:22,239 --> 02:29:26,649
Eye, bad liver.

2619
02:29:26,649 --> 02:29:28,610
Eye, bladder, bad liver.

2620
02:29:28,610 --> 02:29:31,430
Eye, bladder, bad liver shard.

2621
02:29:31,430 --> 02:29:32,670
Eye, bladder.

2622
02:29:32,670 --> 02:29:33,870
That's a cheap brain.

2623
02:29:33,870 --> 02:29:38,870
Eye, bladder, bad liver shard.

2624
02:29:38,870 --> 02:29:52,360
Bladder, bad liver.

2625
02:29:52,360 --> 02:29:53,200
Got it.

2626
02:29:55,590 --> 02:29:57,270
A lung in five days.

2627
02:29:57,270 --> 02:29:58,709
Look at how much money this is.

2628
02:29:58,709 --> 02:30:00,149
Eyeball and roctane.

2629
02:30:01,879 --> 02:30:05,180
Lungs.

2630
02:30:05,180 --> 02:30:06,020
What do you want for here?

2631
02:30:06,020 --> 02:30:07,579
You want bladder?

2632
02:30:07,579 --> 02:30:09,930
Fuck out of here.

2633
02:30:09,930 --> 02:30:12,620
This is worth so much more money.

2634
02:30:12,620 --> 02:30:14,139
All right, now let's get a song here.

2635
02:30:14,139 --> 02:30:17,950
Release something in my brain I can remember what to do.

2636
02:30:17,950 --> 02:30:19,350
Okay, stomach.

2637
02:30:19,350 --> 02:30:21,709
Stomach, soul.

2638
02:30:21,709 --> 02:30:24,270
Stomach, soul, eyeball, roctane.

2639
02:30:24,270 --> 02:30:27,110
Stomach, soul, eyeball, roctane, lungs.

2640
02:30:27,110 --> 02:30:29,870
Stomach, soul, eyeball, octane.

2641
02:30:29,870 --> 02:30:31,629
Stomach, soul, octane.

2642
02:30:31,629 --> 02:30:32,829
I forget it.

2643
02:30:32,829 --> 02:30:34,750
Stomach, soul.

2644
02:30:34,790 --> 02:30:36,989
Stomach, soul, roctane, eyeball.

2645
02:30:36,989 --> 02:30:38,989
Stomach, soul, roctane, eyeball.

2646
02:30:38,989 --> 02:30:40,909
Stomach, soul, roctane, eyeball.

2647
02:30:40,909 --> 02:30:43,350
Stomach, soul, roctane.

2648
02:30:43,350 --> 02:30:45,069
Stomach, soul.

2649
02:30:45,069 --> 02:30:46,229
Stomach, soul.

2650
02:30:48,860 --> 02:30:49,879
Stomach.

2651
02:30:49,879 --> 02:30:52,479
Soul, I need soul.

2652
02:30:52,479 --> 02:30:54,780
Pain.

2653
02:30:54,780 --> 02:30:55,899
Eyeball.

2654
02:30:55,899 --> 02:30:56,739
Stomach.

2655
02:30:56,739 --> 02:30:58,870
Okay, got this one.

2656
02:30:58,870 --> 02:31:02,159
Got that one.

2657
02:31:02,159 --> 02:31:03,239
Stomach, soul.

2658
02:31:03,239 --> 02:31:04,399
Stomach?

2659
02:31:04,399 --> 02:31:05,239
All right, I have stomach.

2660
02:31:05,239 --> 02:31:06,159
Stomach, stomach, stomach, stomach, stomach.

2661
02:31:06,159 --> 02:31:09,110
What is this?

2662
02:31:09,110 --> 02:31:10,440
All right.

2663
02:31:10,559 --> 02:31:23,750
Ooh, I'm too slow.

2664
02:31:23,750 --> 02:31:27,000
This brain is, you need to pair them up.

2665
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:28,520
Yeah, I'm doing the song wrong.

2666
02:31:28,520 --> 02:31:29,559
You're right.

2667
02:31:29,559 --> 02:31:32,159
Hey, thank you, ToastyBro, for the 10 community subs.

2668
02:31:32,159 --> 02:31:35,600
Thank you, Flybot for the 15 community subs.

2669
02:31:35,600 --> 02:31:37,719
Then we had an anonymous gifter with five community subs.

2670
02:31:37,719 --> 02:31:42,190
Thank you.

2671
02:31:42,190 --> 02:31:45,659
Somebody just got fucking banned, I think.

2672
02:31:45,659 --> 02:31:48,260
I looked over and saw, hey man, first time chatter.

2673
02:31:48,260 --> 02:31:49,700
I've been a long time viewer.

2674
02:31:49,700 --> 02:31:51,500
I was wondering if you're ever gonna play Among,

2675
02:31:51,500 --> 02:31:53,139
and then I saw them get deleted.

2676
02:31:55,819 --> 02:32:00,819
I don't know what you did, but apparently you're out of here.

2677
02:32:05,069 --> 02:32:07,430
To answer your question, no, I'm never gonna play Among Us

2678
02:32:07,430 --> 02:32:09,950
unless it's Among Us VR and I'm gonna play for 10 minutes.

2679
02:32:09,950 --> 02:32:17,010
And then I gotta smash my VR with a hammer.

2680
02:32:17,010 --> 02:32:23,000
All right, 60,000.

2681
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:26,110
Hey, rovo, thanks for the 16 community subs.

2682
02:32:26,110 --> 02:32:27,469
Why'd I say 16?

2683
02:32:27,469 --> 02:32:29,620
You gave 10.

2684
02:32:29,620 --> 02:32:31,639
Where did that number come from?

2685
02:32:31,639 --> 02:32:34,639
I really don't know, I'm serious.

2686
02:32:34,639 --> 02:32:37,280
All right, let me see what I have to do.

2687
02:32:37,280 --> 02:32:39,870
Lungs.

2688
02:32:39,870 --> 02:32:40,829
Stomach, soul.

2689
02:32:41,750 --> 02:32:44,479
Lung, lung, stomach, soul.

2690
02:32:44,479 --> 02:32:47,030
Lung, lung, stomach, soul, liver.

2691
02:32:47,030 --> 02:32:49,430
Lung, lung, stomach, soul, bad liver.

2692
02:32:49,430 --> 02:32:52,040
Lung, lung, stomach, soul, bad liver.

2693
02:32:52,040 --> 02:32:54,559
Lung, lung, stomach, soul, bad liver.

2694
02:32:54,559 --> 02:32:56,920
Lung, lung, stomach, soul, bad liver.

2695
02:32:56,920 --> 02:32:58,120
Lung, lung, stomach.

2696
02:32:58,120 --> 02:32:59,360
Lung, lung, stomach.

2697
02:32:59,360 --> 02:33:01,469
Lung, lung, stomach.

2698
02:33:01,469 --> 02:33:04,989
Lung, lung, stomach.

2699
02:33:04,989 --> 02:33:06,149
Lung, lung.

2700
02:33:06,149 --> 02:33:07,430
Lung, lung.

2701
02:33:07,430 --> 02:33:08,709
Lung, lung.

2702
02:33:08,709 --> 02:33:14,909
Lung, lung.

2703
02:33:14,909 --> 02:33:21,209
Lung, lung.

2704
02:33:21,209 --> 02:33:25,260
Lung, lung.

2705
02:33:25,260 --> 02:33:26,219
No lungs today.

2706
02:33:26,219 --> 02:33:29,079
This is bad.

2707
02:33:29,079 --> 02:33:32,110
Liver and soul.

2708
02:33:32,110 --> 02:33:33,549
Nerve cluster.

2709
02:33:33,549 --> 02:33:39,020
Brain.

2710
02:33:39,020 --> 02:33:42,229
I need a new song.

2711
02:33:42,229 --> 02:33:43,440
What do I have?

2712
02:33:43,440 --> 02:33:45,540
I don't even know what these are.

2713
02:33:45,540 --> 02:33:47,500
I have kidneys, stomach, I have stomach.

2714
02:33:47,500 --> 02:33:49,219
I have a brain.

2715
02:33:49,219 --> 02:33:51,370
I have a brain right now.

2716
02:33:51,370 --> 02:33:53,190
I need to get rid of something.

2717
02:33:53,190 --> 02:33:55,489
All right, shit, I got a minute.

2718
02:33:55,489 --> 02:34:01,670
Nerve cluster, nerve, nerve, liver, soul.

2719
02:34:01,670 --> 02:34:04,840
Okay, nerve, liver, nerve, liver, soul.

2720
02:34:04,840 --> 02:34:07,260
Nerve, liver, soul.

2721
02:34:07,260 --> 02:34:09,479
Fuck.

2722
02:34:09,479 --> 02:34:13,879
Market rejoices, because he's murdering planets.

2723
02:34:13,879 --> 02:34:21,360
Holy shit.

2724
02:34:21,360 --> 02:34:28,120
All right, what do I need?

2725
02:34:28,120 --> 02:34:31,879
Nerve, liver, soul.

2726
02:34:31,879 --> 02:34:33,200
A mythic brain.

2727
02:34:33,200 --> 02:34:36,229
Give it to me.

2728
02:34:36,229 --> 02:34:44,680
Oh, 22,000.

2729
02:34:44,680 --> 02:34:47,200
That guy just, I'm glad I did that quest,

2730
02:34:47,200 --> 02:34:51,120
whatever that was.

2731
02:34:51,120 --> 02:34:57,719
Nerve cluster, nerve, liver, soul, lung.

2732
02:34:57,719 --> 02:35:07,149
Nerve, liver, soul, lung, lung.

2733
02:35:07,149 --> 02:35:14,520
Nerve, brain, rock cane.

2734
02:35:14,520 --> 02:35:22,479
It's expensive though.

2735
02:35:22,479 --> 02:35:23,760
Oh, fuck.

2736
02:35:23,760 --> 02:35:26,559
You, I know you want a brain, and I have it right now.

2737
02:35:28,750 --> 02:35:31,489
Oh, okay.

2738
02:35:31,489 --> 02:35:32,329
No longer broke?

2739
02:35:32,329 --> 02:35:33,170
No, not anymore.

2740
02:35:33,170 --> 02:35:35,170
Now I can invest a bunch of money into the stock market.

2741
02:35:35,170 --> 02:35:36,489
I'm looking forward to it.

2742
02:35:36,489 --> 02:35:38,729
Oh, oh, oh, look at that, oh, oh, oh.

2743
02:35:38,729 --> 02:35:40,129
It's capped at six, Jerma.

2744
02:35:40,129 --> 02:35:42,440
Oh yeah?

2745
02:35:42,440 --> 02:35:43,879
Time to cash out.

2746
02:35:43,879 --> 02:35:44,719
Hell yeah.

2747
02:35:44,719 --> 02:35:55,500
It's 45,000 more dollars.

2748
02:35:55,500 --> 02:35:59,659
I got almost 100 ring.

2749
02:35:59,659 --> 02:36:02,729
It doesn't cap at six.

2750
02:36:02,729 --> 02:36:03,569
Oh, that's huge.

2751
02:36:03,610 --> 02:36:10,360
I just had two big things happen there.

2752
02:36:10,360 --> 02:36:11,399
Oh man.

2753
02:36:11,399 --> 02:36:13,079
Everything is all the way up here.

2754
02:36:13,079 --> 02:36:14,000
I gotta wait for it.

2755
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:18,950
This is gonna be a pullback here.

2756
02:36:18,950 --> 02:36:20,469
Will I just get the better one,

2757
02:36:20,469 --> 02:36:24,600
or do I hold onto the money and invest?

2758
02:36:24,600 --> 02:36:33,270
What do you think?

2759
02:36:33,270 --> 02:36:38,639
Cause this will give me 14 spaces.

2760
02:36:38,639 --> 02:36:42,239
Yeah, if I got the money, I'm gonna use it.

2761
02:36:42,239 --> 02:36:44,520
Okay, so what, allow you to carry more cargo,

2762
02:36:44,520 --> 02:36:46,719
but leave a precious thin shell between your organs

2763
02:36:46,719 --> 02:36:50,399
and the horrors of space increases the organ decay rate.

2764
02:36:53,250 --> 02:36:59,879
Okay, that's all right.

2765
02:37:00,760 --> 02:37:01,600
What do I have in my cargo?

2766
02:37:01,600 --> 02:37:03,870
I've got two livers.

2767
02:37:03,870 --> 02:37:07,620
Nobody wants a shitty liver.

2768
02:37:07,620 --> 02:37:13,200
I need lungs, lungs, soul, nerve cluster.

2769
02:37:13,200 --> 02:37:20,840
Lungs, soul, nerve cluster, let's go.

2770
02:37:20,840 --> 02:37:26,360
Here it is, lungs.

2771
02:37:26,360 --> 02:37:28,760
Ah, it was expensive, but it's okay.

2772
02:37:28,760 --> 02:37:30,909
I'll get another one.

2773
02:37:30,909 --> 02:37:36,639
I got money.

2774
02:37:36,639 --> 02:37:38,819
Nerve.

2775
02:37:38,819 --> 02:37:46,440
I'll get another one.

2776
02:37:46,440 --> 02:37:51,559
I need four souls.

2777
02:37:51,559 --> 02:37:55,409
I'll get another one.

2778
02:37:55,409 --> 02:38:00,590
I'll get another one.

2779
02:38:00,590 --> 02:38:06,000
Lungs, do I still need lungs?

2780
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:08,239
Nerve cluster and I need, okay.

2781
02:38:08,280 --> 02:38:11,879
Boom.

2782
02:38:11,879 --> 02:38:12,799
Hell yeah.

2783
02:38:12,799 --> 02:38:14,569
I got new organs.

2784
02:38:14,569 --> 02:38:18,680
11,000 bucks, are you kidding me?

2785
02:38:18,680 --> 02:38:21,440
Oh, I said that if you mix a large shard into the soul,

2786
02:38:21,440 --> 02:38:23,280
you'll, it would make them crop.

2787
02:38:23,280 --> 02:38:24,440
Oh, a shard?

2788
02:38:24,440 --> 02:38:27,920
You got it.

2789
02:38:27,920 --> 02:38:29,440
Shard, two shards.

2790
02:38:29,440 --> 02:38:32,920
Oh boy, look at this money.

2791
02:38:32,920 --> 02:38:39,909
Two shards, lungs, heart, two shards.

2792
02:38:39,909 --> 02:38:41,430
I need a song.

2793
02:38:41,430 --> 02:38:44,040
Let's get it, let's get a good song here.

2794
02:38:44,040 --> 02:38:54,180
Heart, lung, heart, lung, shard, shard, nerve.

2795
02:38:54,180 --> 02:38:55,579
Heart, lung, shard, shard, nerve.

2796
02:38:55,579 --> 02:38:57,979
Heart, heart, heart, heart, shard.

2797
02:38:57,979 --> 02:39:00,750
I don't know what's wrong with my brain.

2798
02:39:00,750 --> 02:39:02,440
I forgot the whole thing.

2799
02:39:02,440 --> 02:39:10,530
Heart, heart, lung, lung, lung, shard.

2800
02:39:12,549 --> 02:39:14,889
Lung, shard, shard, heart.

2801
02:39:14,889 --> 02:39:22,040
Lung, shard, shard, heart, nerve.

2802
02:39:22,040 --> 02:39:26,180
Let's do it again.

2803
02:39:26,180 --> 02:39:31,290
Shard, shard, heart, nerve.

2804
02:39:31,290 --> 02:39:34,440
Take a half of it already, here we go.

2805
02:39:34,440 --> 02:39:38,319
One of these was done, this one.

2806
02:39:38,319 --> 02:39:39,159
This one too.

2807
02:39:40,930 --> 02:39:44,860
I have, I got two hearts.

2808
02:39:44,860 --> 02:39:50,760
Oh shit, I'm so slow.

2809
02:39:50,760 --> 02:40:02,399
Market's still going crazy.

2810
02:40:02,399 --> 02:40:07,129
Still at nine, okay.

2811
02:40:07,129 --> 02:40:08,409
Are you an organ donor?

2812
02:40:08,409 --> 02:40:14,010
I'm an organ trader.

2813
02:40:14,010 --> 02:40:18,579
I have to get rid of this, it's been here for too long.

2814
02:40:18,579 --> 02:40:21,170
Hearts are really useful though.

2815
02:40:21,170 --> 02:40:23,889
If you get a new stock, everything is just way too high.

2816
02:40:23,889 --> 02:40:24,969
Look at the market, it's crazy.

2817
02:40:24,969 --> 02:40:29,629
I need to wait like another few days.

2818
02:40:29,629 --> 02:40:34,809
Everything's going wild.

2819
02:40:34,809 --> 02:40:40,680
I need lungs and I need shards.

2820
02:40:40,680 --> 02:40:43,000
Lung, shard, lung and two shards

2821
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:49,680
and that's a shitload of money.

2822
02:40:49,680 --> 02:40:52,879
Three shards.

2823
02:40:52,879 --> 02:40:55,600
You're buying organs from a hunter of flesh cryptids

2824
02:40:55,600 --> 02:40:56,559
and the organs are normal?

2825
02:40:56,559 --> 02:40:58,520
That's an unlicensed harvester, idiot.

2826
02:40:58,520 --> 02:40:59,760
He's hunting people.

2827
02:41:03,930 --> 02:41:07,010
I literally have no idea what you just told me.

2828
02:41:07,010 --> 02:41:08,569
All right, I need a bunch of shards.

2829
02:41:08,569 --> 02:41:10,729
Gotta get them cheap.

2830
02:41:10,729 --> 02:41:13,559
That lung is way too high.

2831
02:41:13,559 --> 02:41:16,959
Dude, is this, oh my God, look at the heart increase.

2832
02:41:16,959 --> 02:41:21,000
Let's go.

2833
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:27,969
All right, shards.

2834
02:41:27,969 --> 02:41:33,540
I'm not seeing shards right now.

2835
02:41:33,579 --> 02:41:40,739
Shards, lungs, shards, lungs.

2836
02:41:40,739 --> 02:41:47,760
Oh man, come on.

2837
02:41:47,760 --> 02:41:49,879
Finally, that's just 4,300 bucks.

2838
02:41:49,879 --> 02:41:51,079
It better be worth it.

2839
02:41:51,079 --> 02:41:54,000
It is.

2840
02:41:54,000 --> 02:42:02,280
Soul, I'm gonna buy it because it's cheap.

2841
02:42:02,280 --> 02:42:06,870
Shards, I get common, no.

2842
02:42:06,870 --> 02:42:08,190
Remember, buy a penis.

2843
02:42:12,709 --> 02:42:14,430
I just realized I've been like leaning forward

2844
02:42:14,430 --> 02:42:18,280
this whole time.

2845
02:42:18,280 --> 02:42:22,760
All right, anybody else need anything that I can get?

2846
02:42:22,760 --> 02:42:25,360
What lungs?

2847
02:42:25,360 --> 02:42:26,959
I'm so sorry.

2848
02:42:26,959 --> 02:42:27,959
They found me.

2849
02:42:27,959 --> 02:42:29,520
There's too much money in organs

2850
02:42:29,559 --> 02:42:30,959
and they hurt me.

2851
02:42:30,959 --> 02:42:33,799
Oh God, I told them about the lab.

2852
02:42:33,799 --> 02:42:36,440
Only send a gallbladder if I'm worth saving.

2853
02:42:36,440 --> 02:42:39,450
Yeah, well, maybe tomorrow.

2854
02:42:42,420 --> 02:42:44,510
I need shards.

2855
02:42:44,510 --> 02:42:53,520
I got that lung.

2856
02:42:53,520 --> 02:43:01,120
All right, send a gallbladder.

2857
02:43:01,120 --> 02:43:01,959
Just saw one.

2858
02:43:01,959 --> 02:43:04,719
All right, here, take the gallbladder.

2859
02:43:04,719 --> 02:43:10,680
Be saved.

2860
02:43:10,680 --> 02:43:13,059
Mutual fabrication.

2861
02:43:13,059 --> 02:43:15,020
You asked for something exceptional

2862
02:43:15,020 --> 02:43:17,180
and I think I know of a way to deliver.

2863
02:43:17,180 --> 02:43:19,459
Send over an average shard when you get a chance.

2864
02:43:19,459 --> 02:43:21,340
I've got some cutting to do.

2865
02:43:21,340 --> 02:43:24,180
All right.

2866
02:43:24,180 --> 02:43:28,600
Oh shit.

2867
02:43:28,600 --> 02:43:37,719
Market's still at all time high, come on.

2868
02:43:37,719 --> 02:43:41,920
Still have the soul.

2869
02:43:41,920 --> 02:43:43,600
This thing is, look at how good this is.

2870
02:43:43,600 --> 02:43:45,959
It's a gigantic valuable liver

2871
02:43:45,959 --> 02:43:51,110
and it's pretty decent condition.

2872
02:43:51,110 --> 02:43:55,840
I gotta lean forward here.

2873
02:43:55,840 --> 02:43:56,680
They found me.

2874
02:43:56,680 --> 02:43:58,639
Send your credit card if I'm worth saving.

2875
02:44:03,479 --> 02:44:07,569
I have money to spend, but I don't wanna use it.

2876
02:44:07,569 --> 02:44:09,479
All right.

2877
02:44:09,479 --> 02:44:10,920
Average, we need shard.

2878
02:44:10,920 --> 02:44:14,850
I just need a bunch of shards.

2879
02:44:15,090 --> 02:44:22,719
Big leech lymph and just shards, shards, shards, shards.

2880
02:44:22,719 --> 02:44:23,959
Shards, large shard.

2881
02:44:23,959 --> 02:44:32,370
I just said, give me shards.

2882
02:44:32,370 --> 02:44:34,729
No, shards, they're so valuable.

2883
02:44:34,729 --> 02:44:36,690
Come on, soul.

2884
02:44:36,690 --> 02:44:39,750
I'm gonna hold onto the souls though.

2885
02:44:39,750 --> 02:44:45,120
Like, okay, I do some organ harvesting.

2886
02:44:45,120 --> 02:44:46,920
I'm meeting a demand of the marketplace.

2887
02:44:46,920 --> 02:44:48,079
I take care of my family.

2888
02:44:48,079 --> 02:44:50,520
Don't judge me.

2889
02:44:50,520 --> 02:44:52,319
Whatever.

2890
02:44:52,319 --> 02:44:53,159
I'm gonna get a bladder too.

2891
02:44:53,159 --> 02:44:54,000
This always come up.

2892
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:55,860
Shard.

2893
02:44:55,860 --> 02:45:05,750
Just bought, insta-buy any shard I see, no matter what.

2894
02:45:06,030 --> 02:45:07,229
He just wanted any shard, right?

2895
02:45:07,229 --> 02:45:12,200
That's 11 grand.

2896
02:45:12,200 --> 02:45:15,000
Shot.

2897
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:21,850
He's pissed.

2898
02:45:21,850 --> 02:45:26,639
Ooh.

2899
02:45:26,639 --> 02:45:27,600
Okay, here we go.

2900
02:45:27,600 --> 02:45:29,879
Send an average shard when you get a chance.

2901
02:45:29,879 --> 02:45:31,750
Is that what I got?

2902
02:45:31,750 --> 02:45:33,350
Oh, hell yeah.

2903
02:45:33,350 --> 02:45:34,389
7,500 bucks.

2904
02:45:34,389 --> 02:45:35,989
Look at the reputation I'm gonna get for this.

2905
02:45:35,989 --> 02:45:39,100
You kidding me?

2906
02:45:39,100 --> 02:45:52,790
Holy, what'd I do?

2907
02:45:52,790 --> 02:45:54,549
Unwrapping the package from Breckridge,

2908
02:45:54,549 --> 02:45:59,399
a pale ichor clings to your fingers.

2909
02:45:59,399 --> 02:46:02,799
It's a painted canvas, wet to the touch.

2910
02:46:02,799 --> 02:46:05,000
And in its muscular pulse,

2911
02:46:05,040 --> 02:46:11,639
you recognize the form of Mentor Minter is really the power.

2912
02:46:11,639 --> 02:46:13,879
Mentor was dangerous.

2913
02:46:13,879 --> 02:46:17,079
He was conniving and brilliant and petty

2914
02:46:17,079 --> 02:46:19,360
and eternally striving for goals

2915
02:46:19,360 --> 02:46:25,950
he would never allow himself to reach.

2916
02:46:25,950 --> 02:46:29,540
He hoped you assumed his best qualities

2917
02:46:29,540 --> 02:46:35,200
and avoided his worst ones.

2918
02:46:35,200 --> 02:46:36,860
It's no matter now.

2919
02:46:36,860 --> 02:46:40,260
You hang Mentor's stylish refurbished remains

2920
02:46:40,260 --> 02:46:46,329
on the wall of your office.

2921
02:46:46,329 --> 02:46:48,250
Mentor Minter is dead.

2922
02:46:48,250 --> 02:46:50,959
His threats die with him.

2923
02:46:50,959 --> 02:46:54,719
And if there's anything else you need to learn,

2924
02:46:54,719 --> 02:47:02,049
well, he's always around.

2925
02:47:02,049 --> 02:47:04,399
What?

2926
02:47:04,399 --> 02:47:06,600
Wait, did I just win?

2927
02:47:06,600 --> 02:47:11,649
Wait, what just happened?

2928
02:47:11,649 --> 02:47:19,120
Did I just lose?

2929
02:47:19,120 --> 02:47:22,879
I peeped the horror and died.

2930
02:47:22,879 --> 02:47:24,600
I peeped the horror and lost.

2931
02:47:24,600 --> 02:47:27,920
I think that's a bad end.

2932
02:47:27,920 --> 02:47:35,680
Holy shit, what?

2933
02:47:35,680 --> 02:47:40,969
Wow.

2934
02:47:40,969 --> 02:47:42,690
So there are endings?

2935
02:47:42,690 --> 02:47:51,940
How many endings are in the game, I wonder?

2936
02:47:51,940 --> 02:47:55,920
I concluded one of the storylines.

2937
02:47:55,920 --> 02:47:58,360
Reputation points, organs touched, request fulfilled,

2938
02:47:58,360 --> 02:48:01,940
your organs value.

2939
02:48:01,940 --> 02:48:03,979
Okay.

2940
02:48:03,979 --> 02:48:08,020
More endings await.

2941
02:48:08,020 --> 02:48:09,500
Oh, okay.

2942
02:48:09,500 --> 02:48:13,139
So that's one of the endings.

2943
02:48:13,139 --> 02:48:18,370
Shit.

2944
02:48:18,370 --> 02:48:23,979
Wait, I can just keep...

2945
02:48:23,979 --> 02:48:26,860
Oh, wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, wait a minute.

2946
02:48:26,860 --> 02:48:28,700
You had a conclusive impact on this universe.

2947
02:48:28,700 --> 02:48:34,159
Returning will permanently reverse that outcome.

2948
02:48:34,159 --> 02:48:38,409
I kind of want to keep going.

2949
02:48:38,409 --> 02:48:45,860
I don't think I want to start over.

2950
02:48:45,860 --> 02:48:50,079
Yeah, let's go.

2951
02:48:50,079 --> 02:48:51,319
I will lose that ending.

2952
02:48:51,319 --> 02:48:55,719
Well, that's all right.

2953
02:48:55,719 --> 02:48:58,540
What about the coin game update?

2954
02:48:58,540 --> 02:48:59,940
Oh, wait, there was a, what do you mean?

2955
02:48:59,940 --> 02:49:00,780
You mean for real?

2956
02:49:00,780 --> 02:49:07,549
There was a coin game update and it was real?

2957
02:49:07,590 --> 02:49:10,520
Did they add a bunch of stuff?

2958
02:49:10,520 --> 02:49:12,040
No, I'm going to keep going.

2959
02:49:12,040 --> 02:49:13,920
This game's awesome.

2960
02:49:13,920 --> 02:49:14,840
Yeah, I'm keeping going.

2961
02:49:14,840 --> 02:49:16,680
This is fun.

2962
02:49:16,680 --> 02:49:21,200
I'm not done with this yet.

2963
02:49:21,200 --> 02:49:22,360
Market fucking tanked as well.

2964
02:49:22,360 --> 02:49:23,200
Perfect.

2965
02:49:23,200 --> 02:49:31,120
Wait, no, it didn't.

2966
02:49:31,120 --> 02:49:33,030
Where did I leave off?

2967
02:49:33,030 --> 02:49:35,110
30, what was the last thing that happened?

2968
02:49:35,110 --> 02:49:38,159
Okay, so this is just like kind of the next day.

2969
02:49:38,159 --> 02:49:42,760
Yeah, I'm having fun.

2970
02:49:42,760 --> 02:49:45,200
Was a holiday update to coin game?

2971
02:49:45,200 --> 02:49:46,040
Well, we'll see.

2972
02:49:46,040 --> 02:49:47,040
I kind of want to play for a little bit longer.

2973
02:49:47,040 --> 02:49:50,350
This game is actually really fun.

2974
02:49:50,350 --> 02:49:51,469
This game is really good.

2975
02:49:51,469 --> 02:49:54,360
Highly recommend.

2976
02:49:54,360 --> 02:49:55,760
I want to like keep buying stuff.

2977
02:49:55,760 --> 02:49:57,520
It's just scratching itches in my brain.

2978
02:49:57,520 --> 02:50:00,319
All right, I got souls.

2979
02:50:00,319 --> 02:50:03,120
I need to, what do I have to fulfill here?

2980
02:50:03,120 --> 02:50:07,389
I need that gigantic leech.

2981
02:50:07,389 --> 02:50:20,700
I need shard, large shard.

2982
02:50:20,700 --> 02:50:21,739
This is not the one I just did, right?

2983
02:50:21,739 --> 02:50:23,059
No, I'm dying.

2984
02:50:23,059 --> 02:50:23,979
I need a brain, right?

2985
02:50:23,979 --> 02:50:27,639
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right.

2986
02:50:27,639 --> 02:50:31,790
What do I need, need, need, need, need, need, need, need?

2987
02:50:31,790 --> 02:50:36,170
Lung, lung?

2988
02:50:36,170 --> 02:50:37,090
Now we may speak privately.

2989
02:50:37,090 --> 02:50:39,809
The dark emperor, Zimforth, has slept for far too long

2990
02:50:39,809 --> 02:50:41,409
to breathe life back into this corpse.

2991
02:50:41,409 --> 02:50:44,979
Gigantic lungs, lungs, lungs.

2992
02:50:45,020 --> 02:50:51,579
Leech length, shards, shards.

2993
02:50:51,579 --> 02:51:02,920
I need big lungs, shards.

2994
02:51:02,920 --> 02:51:10,000
Leech, I think I can fulfill one, yeah, there you go.

2995
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:11,200
Hell yeah.

2996
02:51:11,200 --> 02:51:15,069
All right, I need a large, large shard.

2997
02:51:15,069 --> 02:51:21,399
Gigantic lungs, lungs.

2998
02:51:21,399 --> 02:51:23,840
Oh, damn it, I don't know what I bought.

2999
02:51:26,149 --> 02:51:31,209
Large shard, fuck, what do I have?

3000
02:51:31,209 --> 02:51:34,719
Soul, I need a gigantic soul.

3001
02:51:34,719 --> 02:51:37,799
Average lungs, I need big, wait, let me get this right.

3002
02:51:37,799 --> 02:51:39,510
Got that one already.

3003
02:51:39,510 --> 02:51:51,520
Gigantic lungs, gigantic leech, large shard.

3004
02:51:51,520 --> 02:52:01,440
No, gimme that, gimme that, I don't even know what it was.

3005
02:52:01,440 --> 02:52:02,399
Why are these so expensive?

3006
02:52:02,399 --> 02:52:09,399
Oh, because they're mythic, okay.

3007
02:52:09,399 --> 02:52:13,079
You are a servant, play coin game.

3008
02:52:13,079 --> 02:52:15,239
I will play coin game today.

3009
02:52:15,239 --> 02:52:23,190
Just sit back and relax.

3010
02:52:23,190 --> 02:52:24,799
That's a good buy.

3011
02:52:24,799 --> 02:52:41,360
19,000, what are you talking about?

3012
02:52:41,360 --> 02:52:46,959
I need gigantic stuff, who are you?

3013
02:52:46,959 --> 02:52:50,159
I think it's time to buy some stocks.

3014
02:52:50,159 --> 02:52:52,959
I'm gonna buy stocks in, not stomach.

3015
02:52:54,040 --> 02:53:08,280
Something expensive, platter, earworms,

3016
02:53:08,280 --> 02:53:16,399
eye-roids, little Joey's heart.

3017
02:53:16,399 --> 02:53:27,069
I just bought one, is that a good idea?

3018
02:53:27,069 --> 02:53:30,930
I could sell a lot of this right now and make some money.

3019
02:53:30,930 --> 02:53:40,040
But I'm gonna hold them.

3020
02:53:40,040 --> 02:53:45,170
All right, let's go, I've got shard, bingo.

3021
02:53:45,170 --> 02:53:47,809
You need big, all these weird specific shit things,

3022
02:53:47,809 --> 02:53:51,600
you know what I mean, large shard.

3023
02:53:51,600 --> 02:53:58,930
Large shard, gigantic leech, gigantic lungs, hearts.

3024
02:54:00,479 --> 02:54:05,930
No, got it.

3025
02:54:05,930 --> 02:54:16,190
Okay, that's the quest.

3026
02:54:16,190 --> 02:54:21,700
I'm gonna get a couple more of these.

3027
02:54:21,700 --> 02:54:23,340
All right, let's get something going here.

3028
02:54:23,340 --> 02:54:25,559
Old little Joey's heart, I will.

3029
02:54:25,559 --> 02:54:26,520
Good platter.

3030
02:54:29,250 --> 02:54:31,420
What?

3031
02:54:31,420 --> 02:54:32,979
I can stop coming around if you want.

3032
02:54:32,979 --> 02:54:34,620
I know what I do ain't kind.

3033
02:54:34,620 --> 02:54:38,329
Sign this release and you won't see my hide ever again.

3034
02:54:38,329 --> 02:54:41,170
No, you gave me a brain that was worth $20,000.

3035
02:54:41,170 --> 02:54:44,579
Keep coming back.

3036
02:54:44,579 --> 02:54:46,299
All right, heart, I need hearts.

3037
02:54:46,299 --> 02:54:50,930
Large hearts, large shit, whatever it was.

3038
02:54:54,959 --> 02:54:56,680
Gigantic shard, right?

3039
02:54:56,680 --> 02:55:02,719
I don't remember, fuck me.

3040
02:55:02,719 --> 02:55:09,930
Large shard, gigantic leech, gigantic lung,

3041
02:55:09,930 --> 02:55:14,370
large shard, gigantic leech.

3042
02:55:14,370 --> 02:55:18,950
What does the leech even look like?

3043
02:55:18,950 --> 02:55:27,659
What does it look like?

3044
02:55:27,659 --> 02:55:33,530
Large shard, gigantic leech, too expensive.

3045
02:55:33,530 --> 02:55:40,120
I'll buy the stomach though, it's cheap and horrible.

3046
02:55:40,120 --> 02:55:53,299
Dude, these are expensive, just start selling them now.

3047
02:55:53,299 --> 02:55:54,500
Free up the space.

3048
02:55:54,500 --> 02:55:57,889
I gotta do something, I gotta get this out going here.

3049
02:55:57,889 --> 02:56:00,979
Leech is 20.

3050
02:56:00,979 --> 02:56:03,340
Oh, here it is, okay, okay, I need gigantic leech.

3051
02:56:07,780 --> 02:56:10,540
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please.

3052
02:56:10,540 --> 02:56:16,120
Large shard, hell yeah, who wanted that?

3053
02:56:16,120 --> 02:56:21,370
You did, that's 11 grand, hell yeah.

3054
02:56:21,370 --> 02:56:25,659
Dude, little Joey's heart.

3055
02:56:25,659 --> 02:56:26,979
Yeah, if you wanna vote,

3056
02:56:26,979 --> 02:56:29,299
the end of the year awards are currently available

3057
02:56:29,299 --> 02:56:33,569
to vote on, the link right now in the chat.

3058
02:56:33,569 --> 02:56:37,879
Go click it, it's 26 categories.

3059
02:56:37,879 --> 02:56:41,600
This, by the way, this stream will be on New Year's Eve,

3060
02:56:41,600 --> 02:56:48,010
not New Year's Day, still planning on doing that.

3061
02:56:48,049 --> 02:56:50,540
So there will be the rumble

3062
02:56:50,540 --> 02:56:54,319
and the awards on New Year's Eve.

3063
02:56:54,319 --> 02:56:56,200
I'm probably gonna start later in the evening

3064
02:56:56,200 --> 02:57:01,200
so I can hit New Year's at least on Eastern time,

3065
02:57:01,200 --> 02:57:04,360
because I know that New Year's on Pacific time

3066
02:57:04,360 --> 02:57:06,879
is way too late for a lot of people.

3067
02:57:06,879 --> 02:57:10,040
So we're going to count down the New Year Eastern time,

3068
02:57:10,040 --> 02:57:14,239
like we do every year anyways.

3069
02:57:14,239 --> 02:57:17,129
So the stream will probably start,

3070
02:57:17,129 --> 02:57:19,409
I'd like to at least go for an hour or two probably

3071
02:57:19,409 --> 02:57:22,989
before the New Year.

3072
02:57:22,989 --> 02:57:26,920
So I imagine you can expect that stream to start

3073
02:57:26,920 --> 02:57:32,129
at maybe seven o'clock, 730 Pacific,

3074
02:57:32,129 --> 02:57:35,379
starting somewhere around like 10, 1030 Eastern.

3075
02:57:35,379 --> 02:57:36,940
Then we'll be able to go for an hour or two,

3076
02:57:36,940 --> 02:57:39,579
say, oh look, happy New Year, we hit the New Year.

3077
02:57:39,579 --> 02:57:42,569
And then go for like another hour or two,

3078
02:57:42,569 --> 02:57:45,879
just like we did last time.

3079
02:57:45,879 --> 02:57:50,530
But let's keep going.

3080
02:57:50,530 --> 02:57:59,319
Good bladder, I did a large shard,

3081
02:57:59,319 --> 02:58:03,899
gigantic leech, just a lung,

3082
02:58:03,899 --> 02:58:12,139
gigantic leech, lung, good bladder.

3083
02:58:12,139 --> 02:58:15,670
Yo, got it.

3084
02:58:15,709 --> 02:58:22,129
Good bladder, gigantic leech, that's too expensive.

3085
02:58:22,129 --> 02:58:25,829
Thank you.

3086
02:58:25,829 --> 02:58:27,750
Whoa, I know I'm just an organ harvester

3087
02:58:27,750 --> 02:58:29,069
and you're a big old organ trader,

3088
02:58:29,069 --> 02:58:32,870
but are we friends, is that what we are?

3089
02:58:32,870 --> 02:58:37,329
I don't know what to say to this guy.

3090
02:58:37,329 --> 02:58:39,760
Did I say no?

3091
02:58:39,760 --> 02:58:45,290
I feel like I have to say yes, sure.

3092
02:58:45,290 --> 02:58:47,409
Okay, already I see a dark blush of life flooding

3093
02:58:47,409 --> 02:58:48,610
into Zimforth's cheeks,

3094
02:58:48,610 --> 02:58:50,930
give him the large eyes he deserves.

3095
02:58:50,930 --> 02:58:53,659
Are we building a person?

3096
02:58:53,659 --> 02:58:57,649
Okay, large eyes, we're making a person.

3097
02:59:04,670 --> 02:59:07,110
All right, let's see what I want.

3098
02:59:07,110 --> 02:59:13,479
Cormix, Cormix, nerve, big eyes,

3099
02:59:13,479 --> 02:59:27,409
Cormix, nerve, big eyes, Cormix, shit.

3100
02:59:27,409 --> 02:59:30,120
You're building a demon?

3101
02:59:30,120 --> 02:59:37,840
Jesus, anybody else want anything?

3102
02:59:37,840 --> 02:59:43,850
Ladder, lung, just any lung?

3103
02:59:43,850 --> 02:59:46,319
Wait, what does it have to be big?

3104
02:59:46,319 --> 02:59:54,100
No, just lungs, buy that soul.

3105
02:59:54,100 --> 03:00:02,850
Cormix, running out of time, there we go.

3106
03:00:08,120 --> 03:00:14,100
Hey guys, these are gigantic, does that matter?

3107
03:00:14,100 --> 03:00:16,860
No, they have to be large eyes, okay.

3108
03:00:16,860 --> 03:00:29,159
What, I didn't need to eat Cormix.

3109
03:00:29,159 --> 03:00:38,899
Tiny eyes, I should have bought that, idiot.

3110
03:00:38,899 --> 03:00:49,659
I'm buying the mythic shard, who wanted that?

3111
03:00:49,659 --> 03:01:00,889
Oh, I just, that was a bad trade, that's a bad trade.

3112
03:01:00,889 --> 03:01:04,809
Yeah, why would I ever sell this to this guy for 3,000?

3113
03:01:04,809 --> 03:01:18,590
That's a bad trade, I'm gonna hold this stuff.

3114
03:01:18,590 --> 03:01:24,149
Oh shit, nice, I'm up 30% on this shit.

3115
03:01:29,469 --> 03:01:37,790
Hey for the funny eyeball man, big eyes.

3116
03:01:37,790 --> 03:01:44,399
Let's just keep going, hurry up.

3117
03:01:44,399 --> 03:01:47,600
All right, my ADHD is freaking out right now.

3118
03:01:47,600 --> 03:01:53,729
I need a Cormix, Cormix, nerve, large eyes, ladder.

3119
03:01:55,489 --> 03:01:58,569
Cormix, nerve, large eyes, nope,

3120
03:01:58,569 --> 03:02:02,750
Cormix, nerve, large eyes, ladder.

3121
03:02:02,750 --> 03:02:06,770
Is it above or below, I don't remember.

3122
03:02:06,770 --> 03:02:13,959
Organ barges are again operational, does that mean?

3123
03:02:13,959 --> 03:02:17,319
Large eyes, yep, here you go, go make the guy.

3124
03:02:23,540 --> 03:02:33,750
Brain, Cormix, gallbladder, casino has been

3125
03:02:33,750 --> 03:02:35,350
approved for the harvest, leech limb.

3126
03:02:35,350 --> 03:02:37,489
All right, let's do these.

3127
03:02:37,489 --> 03:02:41,389
Can I have one of these?

3128
03:02:41,389 --> 03:02:47,020
Okay, liver, gallbladder, double E, Cormix.

3129
03:02:47,020 --> 03:02:49,899
Liver, gallbladder, double E, Cormix, brain.

3130
03:02:49,899 --> 03:02:51,459
Thanks for the fucking 10 grand.

3131
03:02:54,840 --> 03:03:04,639
Liver, gallbladder, double E, Cormix.

3132
03:03:04,920 --> 03:03:17,500
One of these, forget, how much does this thing worth?

3133
03:03:17,500 --> 03:03:27,280
This is kind of depreciating.

3134
03:03:27,280 --> 03:03:35,049
All right, I need E-Cormixes immediately.

3135
03:03:35,049 --> 03:03:37,090
Hi chat, the dev said your money will transfer

3136
03:03:37,090 --> 03:03:40,770
from this game to coin game with a new update.

3137
03:03:45,500 --> 03:03:54,420
That was pretty good, that was really good.

3138
03:03:54,420 --> 03:03:59,360
No E-Cormixes, this sucks.

3139
03:03:59,360 --> 03:04:11,159
Oh, I think these are all E-Cormixes and a nerve cluster.

3140
03:04:14,440 --> 03:04:19,520
I think I'm gonna sell Joey's heart, 25%.

3141
03:04:19,520 --> 03:04:26,239
That's a lot of money, I don't wanna lose it.

3142
03:04:26,239 --> 03:04:31,649
I got this, I hope this appreciates too.

3143
03:04:31,649 --> 03:04:33,329
Ain't just surrounding organs in the,

3144
03:04:33,329 --> 03:04:35,600
okay, wait, wait, I wanna do this.

3145
03:04:35,600 --> 03:04:41,959
Increase the condition, this thing kind of freaks me out.

3146
03:04:41,959 --> 03:04:46,479
What about the Cormix stocks?

3147
03:04:46,479 --> 03:04:52,620
How are they doing right now?

3148
03:04:52,620 --> 03:04:59,840
Dude, this is way too expensive.

3149
03:04:59,840 --> 03:05:01,200
We're almost done with this, there's an ooze

3150
03:05:01,200 --> 03:05:03,479
trickling from the corpse of our mutual master.

3151
03:05:03,479 --> 03:05:11,420
Bring me the best valuable kidney you can find.

3152
03:05:11,420 --> 03:05:17,729
Bring me the valuable kidney.

3153
03:05:17,729 --> 03:05:20,840
I need another song.

3154
03:05:20,840 --> 03:05:27,049
Rot cane, rot cane kidney, rot cane kidney,

3155
03:05:27,049 --> 03:05:30,559
double the Cormix, rot cane kidney,

3156
03:05:30,559 --> 03:05:32,879
double the Cormix nerve, rot cane kidney,

3157
03:05:32,879 --> 03:05:35,440
double the Cormix nerve, rot cane kidney,

3158
03:05:35,440 --> 03:05:39,159
double the Cormix nerve, rot cane kidney,

3159
03:05:39,159 --> 03:05:45,479
double the Cormix, rot cane kidney, kidney,

3160
03:05:46,719 --> 03:05:55,620
Cormix nerve, that one, that one.

3161
03:06:00,489 --> 03:06:07,459
Uh, eyeballs, rot cane, valuable kidney, Cormix.

3162
03:06:15,250 --> 03:06:26,360
Come on, valuable kidney, valuable kidney,

3163
03:06:26,360 --> 03:06:32,639
valuable kidney, Cormix, where's that other Cormix?

3164
03:06:32,639 --> 03:06:39,879
Cormix, what?

3165
03:06:39,879 --> 03:06:45,850
Make sure it's small, small Cormix,

3166
03:06:45,850 --> 03:06:53,700
rot cane, good kidney.

3167
03:06:53,700 --> 03:07:01,040
Oh, shut up, oh, shut up, I just bought so many of these.

3168
03:07:01,120 --> 03:07:05,540
What the fuck?

3169
03:07:05,579 --> 03:07:16,100
I'm buying them though, oh, that sucks.

3170
03:07:18,780 --> 03:07:26,200
I'm losing money on this, get rid of this too.

3171
03:07:26,200 --> 03:07:40,690
Small and it's not valuable, whatever, I don't care.

3172
03:07:40,690 --> 03:07:43,329
Cormix stock is a great idea right now though.

3173
03:07:43,329 --> 03:07:52,799
Oh my goodness gracious, yes, I'm going all in.

3174
03:07:52,799 --> 03:08:01,459
I'm not kidding, I'm going all in, $63,000.

3175
03:08:01,459 --> 03:08:12,159
Look at all this Cormix bullshit,

3176
03:08:12,159 --> 03:08:14,200
increasing condition of nearby organs.

3177
03:08:14,200 --> 03:08:24,870
That should be good, I kinda made a face.

3178
03:08:24,870 --> 03:08:29,799
So now, I wanna do this quest.

3179
03:08:29,799 --> 03:08:33,760
Valuable kidney, of rot canes are just expensive.

3180
03:08:33,760 --> 03:08:44,809
Small, okay, valuable kidney, nope, rot cane.

3181
03:08:44,809 --> 03:08:53,079
What, are you kidding me?

3182
03:08:53,079 --> 03:09:04,319
Shit, rot cane, come on, valuable kidney, somewhere.

3183
03:09:04,520 --> 03:09:20,700
Damn it, valuable, got it, heart, okay, I need it.

3184
03:09:20,860 --> 03:09:32,819
Heart, heart, rot cane, smaller Cormix.

3185
03:09:32,819 --> 03:09:43,840
All right, good, it's a good return.

3186
03:09:43,879 --> 03:09:52,969
Hearts, any hearts, let me see, heart, zero, zero is one.

3187
03:09:52,969 --> 03:09:55,010
We hold the organ bar, it's a small pancreas shipment

3188
03:09:55,010 --> 03:09:56,489
arrives at every port in the vicinity,

3189
03:09:56,489 --> 03:10:00,360
sending market prices into a freefall.

3190
03:10:00,360 --> 03:10:15,350
Buy, buy, buy, buy, buy it, buy it, buy the whole thing.

3191
03:10:15,350 --> 03:10:18,750
Yeah, okay, I need a, I got a smaller Cormix.

3192
03:10:18,750 --> 03:10:22,709
Take that, thank you, I need a heart within a few days.

3193
03:10:22,709 --> 03:10:24,750
These are all just kinda junk here.

3194
03:10:24,750 --> 03:10:32,920
I'm just gonna delete these, what do you got?

3195
03:10:32,920 --> 03:10:38,280
A small leech lymph, I need a lung and a liver.

3196
03:10:38,280 --> 03:10:48,549
Small leech lymph, lung and a liver.

3197
03:10:49,469 --> 03:10:53,950
Lung, it's valuable, no.

3198
03:10:53,950 --> 03:10:56,030
All right, all right, I'm just gonna go to tomorrow.

3199
03:10:56,030 --> 03:10:57,549
I'm withdrawing, German, please tell a joke,

3200
03:10:57,549 --> 03:11:02,219
please tell a joke, I'm withdrawing.

3201
03:11:02,219 --> 03:11:16,770
Withdraw, all right, we're good.

3202
03:11:16,770 --> 03:11:19,809
Okay, oh, it's gonna go back up here

3203
03:11:19,809 --> 03:11:36,799
and it's gonna be $150,000, that's a big, that's big.

3204
03:11:36,799 --> 03:11:40,159
I bet you the necromancer guy's gonna be back tomorrow.

3205
03:11:40,159 --> 03:11:42,360
I'll probably get another ending here.

3206
03:11:42,360 --> 03:11:44,319
After we get another ending,

3207
03:11:44,319 --> 03:11:46,760
we're gonna update coin game

3208
03:11:46,799 --> 03:11:50,190
and we'll check out the new update.

3209
03:11:50,190 --> 03:11:52,190
I wanna play Monster Rancher 2 again though.

3210
03:11:52,190 --> 03:11:55,729
In the new year, we'll figure that out.

3211

I bought them on the 15th, that was for 10,000

3234
03:14:03,569 --> 03:14:17,709

03:15:04,809 --> 03:15:08,559
Sell half or just sell it all?

3247
03:15:08,559 --> 03:15:10,520

Okay, now what is this?

3251
03:15:21,600 --> 03:15:25,479
I could just skip and buy this crazy one.

3252
03:15:25,479 --> 03:15:28,600
What's the difference?

3253
03:15:29,040 --> 03:15:34,250
15 capacity, slowest decay of all organs by 50%.

3254
03:15:34,250 --> 03:15:38,809
Okay, so it's not bad.

3255
03:15:38,809 --> 03:15:46,190
18 capacity, okay, so this protects the ship

3256
03:15:46,190 --> 03:15:49,020
from hazardous cargo.

3257
03:15:49,020 --> 03:15:55,829
26 capacity, oh my God, that goes up high.

3258
03:15:55,829 --> 03:15:59,399
Inside is pockmarked by shrapnel.

3259
03:15:59,399 --> 03:16:00,799
Anything to create one more pocket

3260
03:16:00,799 --> 03:16:02,879
for organs to squish into.

3261
03:16:02,879 --> 03:16:07,360
Oh, so it's a ton of supply, but it's awful conditions.

3262
03:16:07,360 --> 03:16:09,920
And then there's this one.

3263
03:16:09,920 --> 03:16:15,579
Lowest decay of all organs by 80%.

3264
03:16:19,850 --> 03:16:23,129
I'm gonna go with this one here, I think.

3265
03:16:23,129 --> 03:16:30,600
This one, or maybe not.

3266
03:16:30,600 --> 03:16:33,440
This one's 18.

3267
03:16:33,440 --> 03:16:35,000

3271
03:16:49,040 --> 03:16:57,909
Pancreas index looks like it's bouncing back.

3272
03:16:57,909 --> 03:16:59,030
Yeah, there was a big flood.

3273
03:16:59,030 --> 03:17:01,280
