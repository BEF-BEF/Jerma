00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:14,279
Hello. Hi everybody. How y'all doing? I'm doing good. I'm a little tired.

2
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:21,579
But that's because I just got back from the east coast. My plane actually landed really late.

3
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:27,559
So I got in late late late late late last night early early early this morning.

4
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:35,780
I'm a little fucking zonked. But uh we're gonna do we're gonna hang out with some chill.

5
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:46,060
And may as well take in a hot air balloon. Uh we're gonna play Planet Zoo.

6
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:01,640
Those are those are two very distinct dings. I don't even know how I made those sounds.

7
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:11,189
Yeah I must have smiled twice. Now I hope you enjoyed the Halloween stream. Hope you had a safe

8
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:16,230
fun Halloween. After the Halloween stream I ended up staying down there for a little while.

9
00:01:17,109 --> 00:01:24,090
Uh get some stuff situated with my family and see some friends. And I just got back.

10
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:28,489
I just I literally ran here from that getting out of the plane.

11
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,780
Hey great Canadian FK club. Thanks for the five community subs. Thank you.

12
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,599
Let us observe the animals. That's what we're gonna do. Is gonna this is a long tutorial

13
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:47,209
incoming. That's okay. Guy guys it's a long tutorial. All right sorry a sim just yelled at me.

14
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:52,409
Let me put the audio on so you know what I'm talking about. Um this is a long tutorial kind

15
00:01:52,409 --> 00:02:04,859
of day. So you know we would do what we're gonna do. Don't abandon Bugleberry. But why would I?

16
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:11,590
Why would I? He just had like five times reverb.

17
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:21,800
I didn't even know. I didn't know that I had that much reverb on until I watched the stream like

18
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:33,590
two days later. I was laughing so hard. It was so much. You could like barely hear what I was saying.

19
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:43,259
Oh I guess like the reverb was going on top of the reverb. Okay when I first watched it I was like

20
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:49,099
oh I did that. Maybe it like gets fixed. Maybe they like drop the audio like the reverb a little.

21
00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:57,960
No it got like worse. I screamed. Oh I didn't do anything. Right? This is somebody else doing this.

22
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:13,430
Oh man it was so loud. I didn't know it was gonna be that loud. But hey Bugleberry's pretty good at

23
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:26,150
pottery don't you think? What do you mean no? What do you mean no? What did the doctor have to tell

24
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:40,949
you guys? Oh that I was full of shit. That's what he said and he stormed out. Yep. Come on Dr.

25
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:45,580
Schmoyxen was back. That was a ton of fun. I was so glad to see Dr. Schmoyxen again.

26
00:03:49,539 --> 00:04:00,229
Literally full of shit. Was that the same? Yeah that's the same person. We're a legendary doctor.

27
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:10,360
Haunted noises. Jeremiah joined when you had a diaper on. Oh yeah let me talk about the diaper for

28
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:20,660
a second. All right shut up Sim. I was lying in bed in the... I was in a hotel right? I'm lying in

29
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:28,120
bed after that stream and somebody... there's like three or four photos that I saw of like zoomed in

30
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:34,360
diaper full diaper and I put my iPad down and I put rested my head on the back of the pillow

31
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:49,769
and I said was that a mistake to do that? No. It was. It was. It wasn't it? I had this like weird

32
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:55,209
not okay uh look let me like I don't like care about any of that shit right like I don't like

bernard goodwin in the 1980s goodwin house has since become one of the most respected zoos in

73
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:14,419
the country more recently has undergone a further renovation to update many of the habitats and

74
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:19,700
facilities but due to various issues the work hasn't been completed which is where you come

82
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:45,820
this is the first zoo I ever opened and the source of great pride for me this is so cool

83
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:52,789
thanks to a lion breeding program we ran in the 80s but we're in the middle of a big renovation

84
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:59,909
that's where you come in sadly our old contractor had to retire after developing a fur allergy

85
00:11:59,909 --> 00:12:06,710
peacock or devil kept sneezing his dentures into the lion habitat so it's up to you to finish

86
00:12:06,789 --> 00:12:12,629
everything off don't worry though I'm not completely throwing you into the deep end

87
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:19,909
my headkeeper and Nancy Jones will be lending a helping hand whoa oh did you see that jump

88
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:27,990

89
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:28,870
shouting that way

90
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:39,899
okay from that rosy fresh face of yours I'm guessing you're Bernie's new hire

91
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:44,700
good now I hope you're ready to ditch your diploma because we're about to get

92
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:51,019
really hands-on okay but before we begin the real work how about we familiarize you with the zoo

93
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:56,700
by learning how to fly around and visiting some of our beautiful animals okay well these I just

94
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:02,139
have a tutorial and having a look see at the grizzly bear habitat enter enter the grizzly

95
00:13:02,139 --> 00:13:07,419
bear animal habitat camera locate the West African lion habitat look at the empty habitat

96
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:09,820
all right well why does have my controls on the screen why are you taking away from me

97
00:13:11,419 --> 00:13:21,450

98
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:29,340
all right find the grizzly bear habitat oh I see it did you know that grizzly bears

99
00:13:29,419 --> 00:13:35,259
also known as Ursus Arctos horribilis can hibernate for up to seven months a year

100
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:40,940
but then again given the chance I think a lot of people would do that too I don't even want

101
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:45,340
to play I just want to look look at the bear select one of the bears and you'll bring up

102
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:53,259
its information information panels seven years old this is where you can find out all kinds of

103
00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:58,460
information about your animal the most important thing being its overall welfare

104
00:13:59,179 --> 00:14:03,259
you'll learn more about animal welfare today as we go through your objectives

105
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:07,899
but for now let's enjoy this magnificent animal why don't you select the camera at

106
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:17,720
the bottom of its information panel okay activate the animal camera so this is it here whoa see now

107
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:23,000
this is a fantastic way to get a close look at your animals you can also get this view of an

108
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,320
animal by simply double clicking on it yeah that's much easier to do all right well that's cool

109
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,480
okay when you're ready let's pop over to the other side of the zoo what is he gonna go

110
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,200

114
00:15:13,129 --> 00:15:22,100
african lion habitat where is it over here all the west african lion to you and me

115
00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:28,899
lions are the most social cats and they can be as many as 40 lions in a pride although prides of

116
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:36,100
that size are pretty rare as bernie would say those lions are awesome which is precisely why

117
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:41,620
i handle the training instead these days what is that how about we get started on those objectives

118
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,820
they have like a little like a pinata in here and see what he's doing

119
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:57,799
do i pick up the coin pinata enrichment what oh it is a pinata why are they why the pinata is

120
00:15:57,799 --> 00:16:09,700
in here okay look at the empty habitat now what we got empty habitat this way my first animal

121
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:14,899
i can't wait it's gonna be kangaroo no it's gonna be armadillo no it's gonna be a raccoon i want two

122
00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:24,789
raccoons all right i got it it's right there right as you can see it's a lovely space for animals

123
00:16:24,789 --> 00:16:32,789
but it's missing a certain something beavers two somethings warthogs so i'd like to adopt a pair

124
00:16:32,789 --> 00:16:37,990
of them to adopt animals we need to open the animal market which is in the animal trading

125
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:47,769
section people watching right now okay um animal trading there we are a pair of perfectly splendid

126
00:16:47,769 --> 00:16:53,529
warthogs for our zoo just click on them and select adopt from the side menu normally the animal

127
00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:57,769
exchange would be full of animals but i've emptied out the market while you learn how it works

128
00:16:57,769 --> 00:17:02,250
okay so we got the last thing i need is you accidentally ordering a dozen elephants

129
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:08,250
what's wrong with that okay well i'm being drip fed content because the game knows that i would

130
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:15,349
just click this button a thousand times and then have to restart the tutorial so it's size longevity

131
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:21,589
fertility zoo all right let's get one so just send to zoo waiting in the trade center

132
00:17:22,779 --> 00:17:34,740
send to zoo delivery scheduled how many do i need two when you adopt an animal it's automatically

133
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:39,299
placed in the trade center where they're held until you're ready to move them into their habitat

134
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:46,660
which as it happens you are so how about you move them into their new home okay animal store wait

135
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:55,210
animal storage okay so this is animal market animal storage trade history are these stocks

136
00:17:55,769 --> 00:18:03,829
okay so common warthog in trade center move to here when you ask for an animal to be moved into

137
00:18:03,829 --> 00:18:09,349
a habitat your caretakers will go to the trade center collect your animal and deliver them to

138
00:18:09,349 --> 00:18:14,630
your selected habitat i've marked the trade center's location so let's go and watch the

139
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:22,490
caretakers in action oh it already happened okay so animal trading does it where's the trade center

140

143
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:22,259
doesn't mean i hate the warthog okay so i have one okay i got two in here now what's the uh how do

144
00:19:22,259 --> 00:19:33,460
i feed them animal storage okay so i have two in here so what was it what's the next part what's

145
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:45,660
the woman to do but how do i feed them because of nature habitat habitat the tutorial like just

146
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:54,539
gave up on me what was i supposed to go to the trade center first i marked it on your map oh

147
00:19:54,539 --> 00:20:02,119
okay it's over here well as you can see those caretakers don't hang about they'll move those

148
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:07,319
animals to their destination as fast as possible right of course normally we'd have to place the

149
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:13,559
animals into quarantine before moving them into a habitat but i am assured by a good standing

150
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:20,200
that these warthogs are in the very rudest of health okay right let's get the warthogs habitat

151
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:25,240
finished up so we can keep them nice and happy what do they eat each animal in the zoo has an

152
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:31,319
overall welfare statistic basically how happy they are and that overall welfare statistic is

153
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:36,359
it self-compressed of four different areas nutrition social health habitat

154
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:43,720
luckily if you select an animal you'll bring up their animal welfare information panel which

155
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:49,799
we saw earlier where you can see how they're doing that way you'll know exactly what areas need to be

156
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:54,200
addressed but don't worry if that's a lot to remember you can always check the zoopedia for

157
00:20:54,200 --> 00:21:01,960
more information are they not supposed to be eating this let's start elephants care of the

158
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:07,160
warthogs nutrition welfare at feeding station and water station to place a food station and

159
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:13,240
a drinking station now each animal requires a different type of feeding station and for

160
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:20,440
the warthogs it's a small feeding trough so pick up put in case and a water bowl no stop okay

161
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:28,900
uh habitat uh we have water bowl food through small for water bowl okay so 100

162
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:35,029
dollars that's a lot of money for just a big fucking box objects can be placed pretty much

163
00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:39,750
anywhere use the commands below to help change the position okay so you rotate raise and lower

164
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:49,480
that's weird can they put it in the ground okay rotate is z that's i'm gonna have to remember

165
00:21:49,480 --> 00:22:03,480
that rotate toggle advanced mode is x oh god you get like these kind of like blender controls

166
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:13,859
oh no i don't care about that oops how do i move it no why do i have two what have i done

167
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:25,799
uh they can't reach this okay raise it how do i edit it why did i go into like the second life

168
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:41,420
editing mode how do i edit it well m hold on angle snap reset height is shit okay shift reset height

169
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:47,480
there we go okay align to surface is v that's good all right i'm gonna put it like over here

170
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:51,079
let's put like their feeding tray over on the rock so people can watch them eat

171
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:56,200
and they can like look up and like sneeze the food on people i like that okay how about here

172
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:17,349
right here right there okay and then now we need a uh water dish align to surface and um yeah uh

173
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:29,240
all right closely no this is like kind of huge all right how about over here so they can like

174
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:49,430
yeah i want them to like lift up and be able to be like can i angle it that's extremely

175
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:56,869
unhygienic you sign away before you go to the zoo that bath will count towards their enrichment

176
00:23:56,869 --> 00:24:03,670
welfare specifically their toy enrichment welfare mud bath okay get it as close to the people as

177
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:23,099
possible okay um how about like right here right in the corner right there oh nice work you've

178
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:28,700
got a knack for this i see now our contractor had to leave in a hurry so this place is in a

179
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:34,859
shadow state unfinished splash zone what sits all over the shop but the first thing we need to

180
00:24:34,859 --> 00:24:41,099
finish is the ostrich habitat it's over near the hippos is this full do i have to fill this or is

181
00:24:41,099 --> 00:24:53,269
it full if how do i put food in here all right let's go to the ostriches this i'm gonna mix

182
00:24:53,269 --> 00:24:58,470
my zoo is gonna be so bad before we actually start building our ostrich habitat let's pause

183
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:07,380
the game just click the pause button in the bottom right corner okay ah that's more like it so can

184
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:11,380
you do anything when it's paused sometimes it's a good idea to pause the game whilst you're doing

185
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:15,619
something which requires your concentration because it'll stop the zoo spinning out of

186
00:25:15,619 --> 00:25:20,180
control while you're looking the other way let's keep the game paused while we get this ostrich

187
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:27,619
habitat built okay job number one here is to add a habitat gate before we complete the barrier

188
00:25:27,619 --> 00:25:32,500
every habitat needs a habitat gate after all how else would the keep are there dinosaurs in this

189
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:36,500
game without t-rex's here make sure it's hooked up to the path so the keepers can reach it

190
00:25:39,019 --> 00:25:48,390
habitat gate right there right oh it has to be in the gate right here how about like where

191
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:53,670
this is a tutorial let's complete the perimeter barrier so we can adopt us some ostriches

192
00:25:54,309 --> 00:25:58,549
i've marked out an area for you to use so i'd like you to finish off the perimeter using the

193
00:25:58,549 --> 00:26:04,970
brick barrier okay so that is just as simple as just snapping it and dragging it or clicking oh

194
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:25,990
okay oh nice well this is kind of intuitive good work remember before you can place animals in any

195
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:32,869
habitat it has to have a full loop of connected barrier now you've probably noticed that guests

196
00:26:32,869 --> 00:26:38,150
can't actually see into this habitat at the moment at least not without a step ladder but

197
00:26:39,589 --> 00:26:44,390
i'd like you to select a piece of barrier and swap out the brick for a glass barrier so the

198
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:52,019
guests can see in the whole thing or just like one section just make everybody crowd around it

199
00:26:52,660 --> 00:27:01,160
yeah like right here highlight sections then click the grab glass barrier and browse it okay

200
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:07,160
there we go adding in more windows gives guests even more opportunities to see the animals in

201
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:12,440
a habitat i want crowded areas here make sure the guests can get a good view into a habitat from the

202
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:17,880
path they're walking on because it makes them happy and because this would be a pretty terrible

203
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,400
zoo if they couldn't why don't do the whole thing glass then the last thing we need to do

204
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:27,319
is to add a donation box you see when guests enjoy the view of an animal they'll make a donation

205
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:31,240
just make sure you put them in easy to reach places like near a viewing point

206
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:37,240
donation boxes are one of the main sources of income for the zoo so make sure you remember them

207
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:49,509
this is the main source of income is through people wow okay this is a lot like streaming

208
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:56,539
i'm just behind the glass here now before we adopt our ostriches you should click the play

209
00:27:56,539 --> 00:28:02,059
button after all if the games pause then so are our caretakers which will make it a bit tricky

210
00:28:02,059 --> 00:28:07,019
for them to deliver the ostriches eh okay so complete the ostrich i don't even have any

211
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:13,019
ostriches by the way as well as pausing the game you can speed the game up by clicking on the fast

212
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:18,299
forward button it'll run everything at two times and five times faster five times it can be useful

213
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:21,819
especially if you're waiting for money to accumulate or for animals to be delivered

214
00:28:21,819 --> 00:28:26,220
to your habitat personally i use it when i'm waiting for a brew to finish

215
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:32,140
all right you finished the habitat so it's height and we adopted those ostriches don't you think

216
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:41,000
let's get four of them in here ostriches are really tall right now let's see animal uh

217
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:50,230
marketplace common ostrich do they have rarities like is it like legendary ostrich epic ostrich

218
00:28:53,640 --> 00:29:02,009
do they actually have that all right this one's why this one's 464 at all how does it what's this

219
00:29:02,009 --> 00:29:10,819
mean okay well i'm just gonna tell you i'm gonna get a naio okay i'm waiting in the trade center

220
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:26,980
uh move to here relocating to habitat 22 all right let's go hurry up where are you let's go

221
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:33,240
get in why does somebody have to bring a box over here like okay here we go

222
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:54,039
this is opening loot boxes is that what they did in this game they can i just buy crates

223
00:29:54,039 --> 00:30:02,789
to open them and it's like what's nutrition all right now i got a feeding zone what about

224
00:30:02,789 --> 00:30:12,230
this do they want sprinklers is an ostrich like a three-year-old kid well no i don't think we want

225
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:22,730
these okay so let's go to habitat uh food and water feeding state do i need two of these

226
00:30:23,529 --> 00:30:36,420
how many do i need do i need more than one well i'm gonna get the i'm gonna get the expensive one

227
00:30:41,099 --> 00:30:52,299
five did you say five i have to get all four of these while we wait for them to be collected

228
00:30:52,299 --> 00:30:57,819
by the caretakers and brought to the habitat you should get it ready for them add a suitable

229
00:30:57,819 --> 00:31:04,779
feeding station water station and an appropriate food enrichment item it's often best to place

230
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:09,660
things like enrichments and feeding stations near to the habitat perimeter so guests can get

231
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:17,980
a really good view of the animals wait the mouse is fucked up hold on a second here why is this

232
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:32,019
happening because right now right now i'm over the ostrich i'm selecting the ostrich right now

233
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:46,380
what the hell is going on here wasn't this happening before hold on a second yeah this

234
00:31:46,380 --> 00:32:09,579
shit was happening before too this makes no sense alt tab no okay this what why is this happening

235
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:19,220
hide cursor in game trying to try changing window to full screen let me let me see what happens if i

236
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:25,480
just do full screen this is weird maybe it is already in full so no it's borderless all right

237
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:47,829
what if i just do full screen there we go okay weird all right let's get going so does this guy

238
00:32:47,829 --> 00:32:51,589
have to go back and get another one and then come back and bring it what is it is this the only

239
00:32:51,589 --> 00:33:01,769
person that's here doing this all right anyway i need habitat all right uh water throw they like to

240
00:33:01,769 --> 00:33:09,660
drink out of trees don't they no that's a brontosaurus um how about in the corner no no

241
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:14,380
over here i want over here so they can like put water in the mouth and like go up and like spit

242
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:37,369
it out over it people okay food bowl all right that's good and then a slow feeder all right

243
00:33:38,329 --> 00:33:46,759
good to see the ostriches have somewhere they can really stretch one joke did you know they can

244
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:55,240
actually run at 43 miles per hour oh heaven forbid they ever escape the speed camera finds alone

245
00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:07,930
would bankrupt us all right i did it visiting player bernie certainly seems impressed speed

246
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:15,849
camera joke every time we get an ostrich so now we've made the ostriches lives a bit better

247
00:34:15,849 --> 00:34:20,329
let's do the same for the keepers shall we so somebody's visiting the zoo for the keepers to

248
00:34:20,329 --> 00:34:25,690
feed the ostriches and hippos we should build a new keeper hut the keeper huts are where the

249
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:30,730
keepers prepare the food for animals so they should be placed near to the habitats to make

250
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:35,530
sure the keepers don't waste their time walking when they should be looking after the animals

251
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:10,500
who is this visiting player who is this person visiting player it's freaking me out i didn't

252
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:14,260
listen about the phone all right keeper huts are found in the facilities menu all right

253
00:35:15,059 --> 00:35:24,230
plays a keeper hut uh let's do this one you'll need to rotate the keeper huts to get it to connect

254
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:35,369
up to the path how it helps all right uh where did it want me to put this how stupid is it being

255
00:35:35,369 --> 00:35:49,590
dark souls invaded all right over here that's really ugly how about here right there this keeper

256
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:55,590
hut only has space for one keeper but the larger keeper hut can allow multiple keepers to prepare

257
00:35:55,590 --> 00:36:00,710
food at the same time is this her apartment is where they live that keeper huts and other

258
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:04,869
staff facilities shouldn't be placed near to areas where there are lots of guests

259
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:09,829
guests don't like seeing facility buildings and it can affect their happiness

260
00:36:10,789 --> 00:36:18,869
negatively in case that was why something that's all facilities shops and a whole host of other

261
00:36:18,869 --> 00:36:25,510
i don't want to see i only i i want to pretend like i'm in the savannah let's place a transformer

262
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:36,539
next to it shall we well yeah like downtown san francisco oh yeah sorry it's not like this

263
00:36:36,539 --> 00:36:42,500
fucking savannah you know you don't know that now those i don't like seeing that that building

264
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:48,179
that powers the place bury it so disney world's like that there's like fucking a whole city

265
00:36:48,179 --> 00:36:57,750
underground now the reason everything is ugly is because you're using the power heat map this map

266
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:02,869
allows you to see what is and what isn't powered in your zoom oh man so once you've placed your

267
00:37:02,869 --> 00:37:10,099
transformer you can click in the bottom left to turn the heat map off okay so this is what's

268
00:37:10,099 --> 00:37:16,440
powering so anything that's in this circle is being powered they're not going to do like a

269
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:22,760
factorial type thing are they lovely work now the keepers can start using the hut to prepare food

270
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,760
and thanks to where you've put it they won't need to walk very far to deliver it to the ostriches

271
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:34,599
and hippos let's get on to your next objective then bengal tigers we want to adopt some but i'm

272
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:39,400
afraid there's nothing ready for them yet head on over to the plot of land i've marked out it's not

273
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:46,619
too far away in the next building it's the research zone and the transformation zone

274
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:54,090
here you can put two strength potions in with an ostrich and you'll get a strength-based ostrich i

275
00:37:54,090 --> 00:38:13,480
can't wait for that shit what is the objective i wasn't paying attention i forgot a highlighted

276
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:23,400
area okay righty your next job is to build a habitat from scratch and concrete and really

277
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:29,000
expect so go ahead and build it just make sure that the habitat includes that big hole we've dug

278
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:36,519
oh and don't forget to add a habitat gate to the barrier okay so build a build a bengal tiger

279
00:38:37,159 --> 00:39:15,829
be able to see the tigers sure not climbable water tight climb that there's a climbable rock

280
00:39:21,369 --> 00:39:24,650
like it's i just the tutorial i don't care i just i'm just trying to learn how to do everything

281
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:34,380
all right now we fill this hole with what was what is what was it good add the gate complete

282
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:41,099
the habitat boundary okay we need a gate um how about like over here now like in the back this

283
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:49,880
way now bernie takes safety very seriously at his what is he trying to do here probably make

284
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:55,880
sure those tigers can't jump out of their habitat don't you think the way we'll do it is by changing

285
00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:01,880
the height of the height of the barrier okay then you should start by double clicking the habitat

286
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:11,130
barrier which will take you into barrier editing mode okay angles are here length height great now

287
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:15,690
highlight the entire perimeter of the habitat you can do that by clicking and dragging the

288
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:33,940
barrier selection tool drag this widget to select the habitat then drag this okay you just now you've

289
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:38,980
got all of the perimeter selected you can increase the height of it by clicking and dragging the

290
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:45,059
barrier height tool upwards you'll want to make sure it reaches a height of at least 3.7 meters

291
00:40:45,059 --> 00:40:51,940
3.7 meters can i change this to like i'm an american is this it click and drag it

292
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:08,489
turn this into like a baseball stadium all right how about right here let's do four whatever now

293
00:41:08,489 --> 00:41:13,769
that the habitat is in place don't forget to put down a donation box near to your viewing areas

294
00:41:13,769 --> 00:41:19,610
i have to make like fenway park yeah i'll do that especially as these tigers aren't exactly eating

295
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:28,940
instant noodles for lunch okay donation box always remind me that the donation box is in

296
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:34,230
facilities because i will forget should i put more than one like put like two or three of them

297
00:41:34,949 --> 00:41:41,190
well people are gonna be watching from here okay that's the habitat boundary complete the

298
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:47,429
habitat gate in place and most importantly the tigers won't be able to jump out of it anymore

299
00:41:47,429 --> 00:41:57,659
i think it's time we adopted those tigers okay animal market uh

300
00:41:58,619 --> 00:42:04,300
this is a very large increase we went from like two hundred dollars to ten to twelve thousand dollars

301
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:17,420
here whilst our trusty caretakers collect and deliver the tigers let's take a look at preparing

302
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:23,500
the habitat for their arrival we'll start feeding station lake add a suitable feeding station for

303
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:42,900
them okay this is a food a large food tray i think i would like to eat here instead of adding a

304
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:48,099
water bowl these food trays are solo panels some animals need a pool in their habitat so they can

305
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:53,380
go for a swim but they can also use it to drink from all you have to do is make sure the banks

306
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:59,139
of the pool have a gentle slope so they can easily get a nice refreshing drink there's already a pool

307
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:04,980
but you still need to fill it with water you should do that by going into terrain and selecting

308
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:13,260
the water tool okay water here it is calm water or rough water calm water right

309
00:43:14,139 --> 00:43:20,780
add water is just left click and move water oh that's kind of scary uh water is an essential

310
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:24,539
part of many animals lives so it's important in fact to consider when building a zoo many animals

311
00:43:24,539 --> 00:43:30,860
need a body of water in their habitat to swim keep cool and drink from if if water is necessary

312
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:34,460
in this way it'll be highlighted along with any space requirements in the terrain tab of the

313
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:41,699
animals info panel okay create a space to put the water eg create a pit or lake with the terrain

314
00:43:41,699 --> 00:43:45,780
tools highlight the position of the wall in the space for the water to be filled click to fill

315
00:43:46,579 --> 00:43:52,820
some barrier wall types are capable of holding back water yes that'll do nicely of course just

316
00:43:53,059 --> 00:43:58,820
the war togs and ostriches these tigers will also need some enrichment why don't you add some that

317
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:04,969
looks like the bottom of a urinal that does not look like a pool so i can save money okay

318
00:44:05,929 --> 00:44:25,380
okay let's put check it out how is it this is gonna make mud drinking it just eating

319
00:44:25,699 --> 00:44:43,349
mud they're both gonna have diarrhea in like three hours all right so what i'm gonna do place a

320
00:44:43,349 --> 00:44:57,289
toy and food enrichment item enrichment frozen blood pumpkin why is there blood in this pumpkin

321
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:10,760
and a rubbing pad here come here you can like use the rubbing starting to take shape now the tigers

322
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:16,679
are in their habitat so they can hide from the guests or more like do they drink blood out of

323
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:22,679
a pumpkin in england is this for real if that just is normal weather go on add a shelter to

324
00:45:22,679 --> 00:45:29,079
the habitat why are tigers fucked up suitable bits and bobs or if you like just pop down the

325
00:45:29,079 --> 00:45:46,840
blueprint that i've already built for you what oh oh god they're eating his brain they're eating

326
00:45:46,840 --> 00:46:08,010
his brain just take that clip like i'm sorry okay uh so which way is correct should i put some

327
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:20,619
solar panels on this way do they like to be facing people or not facing people oh poor dabs i'm sure

328
00:46:20,619 --> 00:46:25,579
it can't have escaped your attention that the tigers look a bit miffed that's because they are

329
00:46:25,579 --> 00:46:32,380
too keen on the type of terrain habitat select a tiger and bring up its information panel okay

330
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:38,940
it doesn't like its habitat we'll fill it with water click on the terrain tab that way you can

331
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:43,659
view the terrain information and see how they feel about the different types that'll tell you

332
00:46:43,659 --> 00:46:55,750
what the tigers need more of or less of in this habitat okay you need more terrain plants okay

333
00:46:57,510 --> 00:47:04,409
i gave you more water all right you want more plants all right okay then open the terrain

334
00:47:04,409 --> 00:47:10,650
editing tool select painting and give them some more soil yes that should help with the habitat

335
00:47:11,929 --> 00:47:19,369
okay terrain painting tool that if he was like sprinting all right you want more short grass

336
00:47:21,559 --> 00:47:36,469
okay i can do that for you oh you want to cut the grass oh i see tigers don't like uh grass

337
00:47:36,469 --> 00:47:41,190
to be long what happens if i go too far outside the lines oh i'm just in this habitat that's awesome

338
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:52,170
you can't color outside the lines looks good wait wait whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa too much

339
00:47:54,710 --> 00:48:17,219
less grass okay whatever you okay goldilocks there's too much now there's too much long grass

340
00:48:18,099 --> 00:48:37,820
animal needs less long grass how much soil soil okay we need less long grass

341
00:48:38,699 --> 00:48:44,539
it's almost perfect right then all animals need plants and trees from their own biome or continent

342
00:48:44,539 --> 00:48:51,099
you know desert savannahs or asia you look at the thing looks like these tigers need a few more

343
00:48:51,099 --> 00:48:57,500
plants in their habitats to get a perfect fit use plants from the rainforest and temperate biomes

344
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:04,860
that are native to asia farming minus two farming minus two farming minus two the tigers will also

345
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:09,820
want a certain amount of their habitat to be covered by those plants to find out which plants

346
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:16,780
to use and how many select a tiger and go to the environment tab okay so let's take a look

347
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:22,219
so that's now as you can see some of the plants currently in the habitat aren't quite right for

348
00:49:22,219 --> 00:49:29,420
the tiger like the wattle bushes wattle bushes why would they put them here okay the the wattle

349
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:33,739
bushes you can find all of the plants you need in the nature section and you can use the filters

350
00:49:33,739 --> 00:49:38,860
to only show the types of plants you want to see in this case that's plants from the rainforest

351
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:45,699
or temperate biomes use filters to get the correct continent and biome for tigers

352
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:59,110
um what do we want here well first hold on a second you've got too many things open on

353
00:49:59,110 --> 00:50:07,219
my screen at once now can i make this thing like 10 smaller hold on get out of here like

354
00:50:07,219 --> 00:50:20,539
let me go come here plants yeah i know so if i go to your not enrichment terrain terrain okay

355
00:50:21,099 --> 00:50:30,619
okay so uh environment plants and coverage continent asia biomes tropical temperate and

356
00:50:30,619 --> 00:50:38,460
grassland but you don't like these so how do i just i want to just delete these like how do i just get

357
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:54,659
rid of these all right so we need we're gonna do tropical so tropical and then asia sure it's down

358
00:50:54,659 --> 00:51:06,969
here so let's do uh tropical and asia all right so you want some of these how about uh coconut

359
00:51:07,769 --> 00:51:15,130
coconut palm that would be cool over here right here let's put it up here so like the coconuts

360
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:37,369
drop and i'll keep his heads can i straighten this thing up why is it so bent okay looks all

361
00:51:37,369 --> 00:51:47,429
right i want to get rid of this how do i just delete these delete this is gonna be an easier

362
00:51:47,429 --> 00:52:03,139
way for me to do this right all right how about a a bangle bamboo right there all right oh i thought

363
00:52:03,139 --> 00:52:09,190
i put that down all right you look like you're all right how's your environment doing you want

364
00:52:09,190 --> 00:52:18,940
more plants all right get rid of this thing where's this can i like go to plant all right where's this

365
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:25,860
thing ready this tree they don't want this tree they hate this thing okay now let me put and they

366
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:37,380
want more plants how why do you want so many do they really want that many more or how about um

367
00:52:38,340 --> 00:53:00,469
like a little group of these over here okay and then how's that how do i clean up their shit

368
00:53:03,699 --> 00:53:11,099
what's what's pre-recorded actually pre-recorded what are you talking about what is actually

369
00:53:11,099 --> 00:53:24,570
pre-recorded now i want it smaller here we go like all right is that is that fine do you like that

370
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:29,099
i mean no one said that you all of you were saying that i need more of this

371
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:56,199
coverage zero percent how much more do you want all right let's go with temperate asia and you want

372
00:53:56,199 --> 00:54:09,349
like some elm trees this is so huge though this just blocks view put on your face cam not put on

373
00:54:09,349 --> 00:54:34,340
my face cam okay and then how about like down here it's more tree than animal

374
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:42,099
they say the good fences make good neighbors i guess that's doubly true when one of the neighbors

375
00:54:42,099 --> 00:54:49,539
is a bengal tiger all right cool still those tigers look so happy that i doubt they'd leave

376
00:54:49,539 --> 00:54:55,900
even if you didn't poke a hole in their fence oh but for heaven's sake don't test that theory

377
00:54:56,860 --> 00:55:04,710
i'm not gonna move this right let's head over to the indian peafowls i've been told that we need to

378
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:12,420
improve their social welfare okay i'm starting to get it there's a maze in here this is cool

379
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:16,980
just find one of the peafowls and select them to open an information panel then we can have a good

380
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:21,300
gander at how they're doing is this maze for me i suppose ganderin would just be for geese

381
00:55:22,739 --> 00:55:28,820
found one expand their social welfare and we can get a bit more detail

382
00:55:29,619 --> 00:55:34,420
social group there are too few adults and juveniles in animals social group

383
00:55:35,139 --> 00:55:39,699
uh now they've clearly got plenty of space and they're not stressed but it looks like

384
00:55:39,699 --> 00:55:45,539
this social group isn't quite right so let's find out more click on the social tab at the top of

385
00:55:45,539 --> 00:55:54,179
their information panel adult population is only two right as you can see the peafowls need their

386
00:55:54,179 --> 00:55:59,460
population to be larger to solve this little problem you'll need to adopt three more female

387
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:11,239
people three female power to the animal market then okay here we go uh we need female bring them

388
00:56:11,239 --> 00:56:28,679
in i think i'm gonna play this like all night good work on those people but sadly it sounds

389
00:56:28,679 --> 00:56:33,239
like our snow leopard is a bit grumpy let's head over there and see what's wrong with her

390
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:47,079
something about the snow leopard i don't know how to snow leopard just like people animals can

391
00:56:47,079 --> 00:56:52,119
suffer from stress if things aren't quite right you know like how shitty that is in the milk

392
00:56:52,119 --> 00:56:57,400
before the teabag in the case of these snow leopards they're a bit stressed by their lack

393
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:03,639
of privacy you can lower their stress levels by swapping out the normal glass barrier by their

394
00:57:03,639 --> 00:57:08,599
cave for one-way glass i don't see any stress not a cheap option but i think they're worth the

395
00:57:08,599 --> 00:57:13,320
expense don't you this will give the snow leopard somewhere to go when they want to get away from

396
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:34,500
the prying eyes it's going up it's gonna jump over i just like realize how fucked up this is

397
00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:47,239
that'd be like i might have like looked out my window they were like 700 people all looking in

398
00:57:47,239 --> 00:57:58,980
the window by the way this is when i'm showering wow this is getting a lot of money imagine you

399
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:02,179
get out of the shower and you're just brushing your teeth with a towel around your waist

400
00:58:03,699 --> 00:58:10,340
and you turn around and your whole the whole wall of your bedroom and your bathroom is glass

401
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:18,679
and there are just people staring there watching you like take a shower i'm getting out of there

402
00:58:18,679 --> 00:58:33,269
that's what's gonna happen all right so what do i need to do uh one way glass barrier

403
00:58:37,989 --> 00:58:42,170
how much just enough to make them i don't understand like

404
00:58:42,170 --> 00:58:49,219
like the whole thing or just a little bit just where everybody's standing

405
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:56,340
okay so that's selected now how do i say yes

406
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:21,139
what i'm just doing oh right okay well this is even worse how do i what's going on here

407
00:59:21,139 --> 00:59:29,460
okay um what

408
00:59:35,369 --> 00:59:38,820
i did it right that's not me doing it

409
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:58,920
is it no wall this is a wall here already i don't understand what's going on one way glass

410
01:00:00,119 --> 01:00:19,300
like select it but it's there so why is it still telling me to do this i'm selecting the wall one

411
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:32,840
way wait one way glass from the outside that's what only the window part of course when an

412
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:38,760
animal isn't in its natural biome it's probably going to be too hot or too cold unsurprisingly

413
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:45,159
for the snow leopards it's it's too hot i can't just select it you should help cool it down by

414
01:00:45,159 --> 01:00:50,360
adding some coolers to their habitat but let's start by opening up the temperature heat map

415
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:54,119
and having a look see at the temperature in the leopard's habitat heat map

416
01:00:55,880 --> 01:01:03,219
open the heat map this is electricity oh okay as you can see we already have one cooler in there

417
01:01:03,219 --> 01:01:07,780
let's pop some more down and get as much of the habitat as chilly as we can there's like too much

418
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:13,699
going on this habitat already has power but you'll need to make sure that in the future just so you

419
01:01:13,699 --> 01:01:20,579
know if any part of a habitat is powered then the whole this whole place is on fire look at how hot

420
01:01:20,579 --> 01:01:33,269
it is in here is that safe okay coolers so where should i put this just it doesn't matter anywhere

421
01:01:34,949 --> 01:01:52,219
over here how many do i want to put down okay is that better and it's did they're working yeah

422
01:01:58,309 --> 01:02:10,409
habitat 91 yeah this is this is fine put them in the middle these people are freezing

423
01:02:13,750 --> 01:02:17,030
so the whole habitat's supposed to be like this well i would have done that

424
01:02:20,409 --> 01:02:25,130
you can find heat maps for all sorts of helpful things so do be sure to explore them and make

425
01:02:25,130 --> 01:02:31,050
good use of them okay this coolers and heaters it'll take a little while for the temperature to

426
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:36,090
adjust once you've added coolers or heaters but now we've got the coolers in we can address the

427
01:02:36,090 --> 01:02:41,289
leopard's terrain welfare you see what the leopards really want in here is snow and rock so let's make

428
01:02:41,289 --> 01:02:48,630
that happen so somebody just half-assed this part okay terrain so you want snow

429
01:02:50,739 --> 01:03:05,940
just the whole thing we're just painting this on the ground this is horrible this is so cruel

430
01:03:06,739 --> 01:03:37,780
protesters have arrived at your zoo what it's only one right when i say it

431
01:03:41,829 --> 01:03:47,110
okay let's all of that should give you a pretty good understanding of how to make animals happy

432
01:03:47,429 --> 01:03:53,110
so i'd like you to go and check on all the other animals any issues with their habitat care given

433
01:03:53,110 --> 01:03:57,829
to your animals increase the average welfare of the animals across the whole zoo why didn't you

434
01:03:57,829 --> 01:04:05,030
tell me about this welfare is a very important statistic now to quickly see how all your animals

435
01:04:05,030 --> 01:04:09,829
are doing in the zoo somebody's not doing okay management and then into the animals section

436
01:04:09,829 --> 01:04:17,699
zoo management and then go to the animal section as you can see this list shows you the animals

437
01:04:17,699 --> 01:04:22,980
overall welfare so if something's a mess then you can quickly pop over to them using the locate

438
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:28,500
button right i'm going for a cut by while you make sure all the animals are well looked after

439
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:43,019
enrichment habitat oh wait it's the zebras you're contraceptive so what how do i go how do i go over

440
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:49,510
all right all right what's wrong with this place wait this is us but there's a switch of giraffes

441
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:56,579
in here where did you come from okay what's wrong with this habitat let's find out what do you think

442
01:04:56,579 --> 01:05:02,949
what's wrong welfare your habitat sucks and your enrichment sucks too insufficient food

443
01:05:02,949 --> 01:05:08,150
enrichment is being provided to cover all animals and there's not enough toys in here okay and

444
01:05:09,619 --> 01:05:15,860
this is not a good i didn't do this yeah just just get on like the the playground thing that

445
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:21,539
spins around everyone will have fun on that all eight of you can sit on it all right let's do um

446
01:05:22,659 --> 01:05:31,159
terrain so what's the what's wrong with the terrain what kind of terrain do you like

447
01:05:32,809 --> 01:05:37,579
you like okay there's not there's not enough short grass there's not enough long grass and

448
01:05:37,579 --> 01:05:45,929
there's too much soil well shit let me i'll take care of this no no no terrain all right there's

449
01:05:45,929 --> 01:06:12,730
not enough short grass let's do this around the bank plenty of rocks intensity and just that's

450
01:06:12,730 --> 01:06:23,989
better they have like nice green grass over here okay grass is good now we need some long grass

451
01:06:23,989 --> 01:06:30,900
i'm gonna do long grass over here um this way back behind here are they even enclosed

452
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:49,340
let's do they don't want any soil so it's all short and long grass all right take out the soil

453
01:06:50,219 --> 01:07:05,210
this looks better all right so that's better took care of that wait there's too much there's not

454
01:07:05,210 --> 01:07:11,590
enough short grass now i got it okay so that's okay now you guys are happy what about the giraffe

455
01:07:11,590 --> 01:07:17,190
the giraffe is the only one in here is the giraffe the weird outlier here oh shit okay now special

456
01:07:17,190 --> 01:07:29,429
food enrichment for a second i thought they were enriched by zebras and i'm thinking what kind of

457
01:07:29,429 --> 01:07:36,710
fucked up environment is this no that's a species bonus okay all right so the environment they don't

458
01:07:36,710 --> 01:07:43,579
like these trees so why did he put them all here they're everywhere how many are in here

459
01:07:45,639 --> 01:07:58,570
there's so many of these in here why are these all in here it's for the tutorial yeah but i mean

460
01:07:58,570 --> 01:08:07,239

462
01:08:19,899 --> 01:08:35,430

464
01:08:47,020 --> 01:08:52,710
holds control to toggle selection but i don't want to get rid of everything at this point

543
01:23:47,239 --> 01:23:56,180
wait there's a disease habitat cleanliness is a disease risk for what i don't even know

544
01:23:56,180 --> 01:24:04,010
where i'm going the lemur we haven't gotten that far in the tutorial yet i can't believe i deleted

that fucking building because i'm trying to select a goddamn bush so what's wrong with this place

546
01:24:13,930 --> 01:24:28,840
i this is power is it like cleanliness habitat temperature water power buildings negative impact

547
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:38,359
on guests why is it doing this habitat climate is a disease risk let's put on your fucking x-ray

548
01:24:38,359 --> 01:25:11,500
goggles how did somebody okay i get it i have to get out of this i have to play a new scenario

549
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:23,850
it's all it's fucked forever all right i know i'm gonna do a different scenario

550
01:25:27,689 --> 01:25:40,380
that was fucking horrible okay let's go back to the main menu um should i save it i guess i'll

551
01:25:40,380 --> 01:26:00,420
save it just whatever uh it's because the journey okay main menu we're gonna do a different i need i

552
01:26:00,420 --> 01:26:13,350
still need to learn i still need to learn how to play i'm still learning i opened up another

553
01:26:13,350 --> 01:26:24,739
scenario see okay we are i'm already done with the goodwin house the madagascan simian conservation

554
01:26:24,739 --> 01:26:41,130
project tutorial okay this is just going to teach us some new things no tutorial no i have to do

555
01:26:41,130 --> 01:26:44,729
there's a lot of systems in place i need to at least kind of have somewhat of an idea what the

556
01:26:44,729 --> 01:27:04,819
hell i'm doing i can't i'm having trouble i can't get over it welcome to madagascar it's quite the

557
01:27:04,819 --> 01:27:11,460
change of scenery from dreary old england apart from the weather i suppose they don't call these

558
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:19,060
places rainforest for nothing the zoo you'll be working in is an ape sanctuary we're doing

559
01:27:19,060 --> 01:27:25,539
vitally important conservation work not just for apes but for all kinds of species but apes

560
01:27:25,539 --> 01:27:31,779
well apes are some of the closest relatives to humans there are and yet the way the world treats

561
01:27:31,779 --> 01:27:40,539
them is like well very much like some of us treat our actual relatives anyway that's why i'm

562
01:27:40,539 --> 01:27:46,140
determined that our operation here does some good if we can all leave some part of the world in a

563
01:27:46,140 --> 01:27:52,859
better state than we found it we'll have lived lives worth living and speaking of states i have

564
01:27:52,859 --> 01:27:58,859
a horrible feeling i left the house in a right one when i get back i expect my life will be worth

565
01:27:58,859 --> 01:28:15,020
living at all this is bernie's primate sanctuary it's not just primates though we've got all sorts

566
01:28:15,020 --> 01:28:20,220
of animals so why don't we go and have a look at some of them eh we'll start by taking a look at

567
01:28:20,220 --> 01:28:24,859
the red rough lemurs they're the ones that look like they should be in a shakespeare play

568
01:28:25,659 --> 01:28:33,689
come on let's head over to them okay i think i'm gonna be all right okay locate the highlighted

569
01:28:33,689 --> 01:28:44,380
area there it is this is a nice little setup i thought these were sinks from back here that's

570
01:28:44,380 --> 01:28:51,420
in northeast madagascar oh cool they can actually live anywhere from 15 up to 25 years that's a long

571
01:28:51,420 --> 01:28:57,819
time okay when you're ready let's go find out bornean orangutans i like this little

572
01:28:57,819 --> 01:29:09,500
playground that they have hey let's find the orangutans the bornean orangutan is such a

573
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:15,020
marvelous creature they're always a big favorite at any zoo they feature in and they're also the

574
01:29:15,899 --> 01:29:21,659
dwelling animal on the planet assuming you don't count any lions that got stuck up one

575
01:29:22,460 --> 01:29:27,180
oh why don't you take a better look at them open up that information panel and go into the

576
01:29:27,180 --> 01:29:37,479
animal camera okay let's go let's take a look aren't they just incredible i like the zoom

577
01:29:37,479 --> 01:29:42,039
in feature it's really cool when you're ready let's go and have a look see it some of our

578
01:29:42,039 --> 01:29:59,300
beautiful bonobos they're quite the characters what's that noise you can do cinematic camera

579
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:08,359
okay yeah all right let's go to the other place these habitats are really well done i want to make

580
01:30:08,359 --> 01:30:14,310
like a habitat from scratch that's pretty much what i care about oh dear it looks like we've

581
01:30:14,310 --> 01:30:23,670
arrived just in time one of the habitat's barriers has collapsed we'll need to catch them but before

582
01:30:23,670 --> 01:30:29,670
we do we should box up the other bonobos to stop them escaping too select the habitat boundary to

583
01:30:29,670 --> 01:30:40,390
bring up the habitat information panel okay good now open the animals tab animals and click on box

584
01:30:40,390 --> 01:30:49,579
all animals box all animals whoa we'll need a vet to recapture that escaped bonobo but it seems our

585
01:30:49,579 --> 01:30:55,579
last one left to do some research in the wild not an ideal situation so we'll need to hire a

586
01:30:55,579 --> 01:31:01,819
replacement sharpish hire a vet go into the zoo section and then into the staff management area

587
01:31:01,819 --> 01:31:08,220
staff and then i know you can find all of your staff in here so there's no time to go looking

588
01:31:08,220 --> 01:31:15,659
at their particulars at the moment hire a vet hire a vet now click on one of the paths to place

589
01:31:15,659 --> 01:31:22,539
the vet in your zoo right there great now let's deal with our escapee before they can cause too

590
01:31:22,539 --> 01:31:31,220
much havoc okay use the animal alerts to jump to the escaped bonobo okay right here call the

591
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:41,159
vet on the call vet button to call the vet over to capture it okay that's a relief so while the

592
01:31:41,159 --> 01:31:47,720
vet deals with our bonobo friend let's go fix up their habitat okay is it i understand okay i get

593
01:31:47,720 --> 01:31:53,239
it that this is like dangerous and scary but like it's just one monkey

594
01:31:54,199 --> 01:32:22,199
oh did he trip this guy i don't give a fuck okay ah so now i have relocating as you can see the

595
01:32:22,199 --> 01:32:27,319
barrier's collapsed someone's taken their eye off the ball obviously let's get this one replaced

596
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:32,359
this is what i needed to know last time and then we'll edit it okay delete the broken section of

597
01:32:32,359 --> 01:32:40,649
barrier and replace it with a brand spanking new one the broken section of barrier okay so right

598
01:32:40,649 --> 01:32:48,600
here so you have to you have okay you have to delete the part first how do they break it

599
01:32:49,399 --> 01:33:19,460
obstructed i'm not gonna leave like a barn door open like connected whether wrong am i insane

600
01:33:20,979 --> 01:33:28,260
i'm not right okay now that we've done that we need to make sure to add barriers to the top

601
01:33:28,340 --> 01:33:32,500
that way the bonobos won't be able to climb out just make sure you've got the correct

602
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:39,699
piece of barrier selected when you do that climb proof options climb proof so go into the option

603
01:33:39,699 --> 01:33:44,979
section and select which side the climb proof barrier needs to go on and don't get it wrong

604
01:33:45,779 --> 01:33:49,380
we're more worried about bonobos climbing out than guests climbing in

605
01:33:50,739 --> 01:33:56,500
people will climb into these things nicely done and i think it's high time we unboxed those bonobos

606
01:33:56,819 --> 01:34:01,300
that's not correct the poor mites will get sad if we leave them in there for too long

607
01:34:02,340 --> 01:34:06,100
select the habitat barrier to bring up the habitat information panel again

608
01:34:07,220 --> 01:34:21,050
okay what is it select the habitat information panel and then open the animals tab animals

609
01:34:22,010 --> 01:34:28,970
unbox all animals and finally click on unbox all animals to let them out i expect some of them

610
01:34:28,970 --> 01:34:38,220
are fair bursting for the toilet it turns out that as well as the old vet leaving the zoo's

611
01:34:38,220 --> 01:34:42,939
mechanics realistic sounds we'll need to hire a couple of new ones so we can help stop any more

612
01:34:42,939 --> 01:34:49,979
breakouts why do all sorts of helpful things around the zoo but one of their most important

613
01:34:49,979 --> 01:34:55,420
jobs is taking care of the habitat barriers without mechanics around to repair them the

614
01:34:55,420 --> 01:35:01,659
barriers will crack crumble and fall down and before you know it will be overrun with escaped

615
01:35:01,659 --> 01:35:07,340
animals so don't do wood section and then into the staff management area again make it out of

616
01:35:07,340 --> 01:35:16,699
cement and then paint it to look like a tree right what's the i don't understand hire a mechanic and

617
01:35:16,699 --> 01:35:26,409
then click on a path to place them in the zoo okay and then click on the path again to hire a second

618
01:35:26,409 --> 01:35:31,689
mechanic as you can see you don't have to go back into staff management if you're hiring lots of

619
01:35:31,689 --> 01:35:37,560
the same type of staff member okay so now they're going to be able to watch

620
01:35:40,680 --> 01:35:50,250
i'm off for a cuppa oh i think bernie wants a word with you what does he want oh i hear you had a bit

621
01:35:50,250 --> 01:35:56,010
of an issue with an escape bonobo the main thing is that you dealt with it swiftly and more

622
01:35:56,010 --> 01:36:00,810
importantly without the animals stealing someone's clothes putting them on and then walking out of

623
01:36:00,810 --> 01:36:07,210
the front gate i thought that was an animal you see another key responsibility for our vets

624
01:36:07,210 --> 01:36:13,210
oh these things are vicious by the way researching animals allows vets to unlock new enrichment items

625
01:36:13,210 --> 01:36:18,090
additional information for our education resources enhanced breeding programs and

626
01:36:18,090 --> 01:36:24,810
improvements to food quality oh the animal's food not the vets it'll take more than a research

627
01:36:24,810 --> 01:36:31,050
grant as you can see research is a key part of running your do it

628
01:36:32,090 --> 01:36:38,489
in order for a vet to undertake research they require a research center and once again that's

629
01:36:38,489 --> 01:36:43,689
something that this zoo is missing so let's build one i've marked out an area for you to put it

630
01:36:43,689 --> 01:36:54,899
a research center right here now you've probably noticed that there's already a building where i

631
01:36:54,899 --> 01:37:00,180
want you to build the research center don't worry you see the building that's currently there is

632
01:37:00,180 --> 01:37:06,180
actually a hollow shell so we're able to place our new building inside of it if you select the

633
01:37:06,180 --> 01:37:10,739
research center for placement and then hover over the shell you'll see that it asks if you

634
01:37:10,739 --> 01:37:19,260
want to add the research center to the existing building okay so okay click to add it to the

635
01:37:19,260 --> 01:37:24,699
building oh but that won't place it in just yet though first we'll need to rotate our research

636
01:37:24,699 --> 01:37:43,079
centers which automatically connects to the path when we place it uh okay wait okay ensure auto

637
01:37:43,079 --> 01:37:50,199
stacking is off to make splendid work now that we have a brand spanking new research center we can

638
01:37:50,199 --> 01:37:56,439
give our vets something to do in there oh by the way it's worth noting that the vets will only do

639
01:37:56,439 --> 01:38:02,119
research when they're not required to do any other jobs that said you can change what jobs a vet does

640
01:38:02,199 --> 01:38:05,960
does have a bunch of vets how much money you get to start with let's not worry about that just now

641
01:38:06,920 --> 01:38:13,640
so let's get our vet researching ring-tailed lemurs go into the zoo section and select vet

642
01:38:13,640 --> 01:38:21,399
research vet research and then bugs you can see a list of all the animals present in your my first

643
01:38:21,399 --> 01:38:27,880
zoo is going to be bugs only potential diseases that can occur now let's have a cockroach on to

644
01:38:27,880 --> 01:38:37,130
the ring-tailed lemur to start their research one star megan what is up with this actually

645
01:38:37,130 --> 01:38:42,250
thinking about it i'm not sure we've got any education i'm gonna have like 10 000

646
01:38:44,170 --> 01:38:49,770
let's head over there and add some so our guests can learn all about the fairy little delights

647
01:38:49,770 --> 01:39:00,409
okay so this is first off let's pop down to education educational boards place them on

648
01:39:00,409 --> 01:39:05,689
the habitat barriers at a height that guests can see or if you like pop them down on a stand

649
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:10,359
yeah well i would do that but i think what i'm gonna write here is

650
01:39:13,640 --> 01:39:19,479
private chests don't do not open i'm gonna put two of them here back to back next to my

651
01:39:19,479 --> 01:39:42,819
storage box what was i making an educational board what the hell is it i thought they were

652
01:39:42,819 --> 01:39:47,220
throwing stuff into the habitat workshop trade center research center what's it what's it what's

653
01:39:47,220 --> 01:40:09,800
it called information board education board facilities uh is it not in there what it

654
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:32,180
find education boards in here okay what the fuck are you talking about oh this no god this is ugly

655
01:40:33,850 --> 01:40:54,090
a line to surface okay and then one over here okay now that they've been put into position

656
01:40:54,250 --> 01:40:59,130
we have to tell them what animal to display information about select one of the education

657
01:40:59,130 --> 01:41:06,409
boards to bring up its information panel habitat education board okay educational content from the

658
01:41:06,409 --> 01:41:15,850
drop down list select ring-tailed lemur yeah when you link an education board or a speaker to an

659
01:41:15,850 --> 01:41:21,770
animal you need to make sure that said animal is close by if it isn't the guests will get confused

660
01:41:21,770 --> 01:41:28,970
and won't learn as much okay ring-tailed lemur cool okay now that we've done the education boards

661
01:41:28,970 --> 01:41:34,329
let's pop down a pair of speakers speakers play audio to the guests so they can learn while they

662
01:41:34,329 --> 01:41:38,970
look at the animals instead of having to go through the laborious process of reading

663
01:41:39,609 --> 01:41:45,130
okay one thing to bear in mind is that it's important not to put the speakers too close

664
01:41:45,130 --> 01:41:50,090
together if you do the guests won't be able to understand what's being said why

665
01:41:51,289 --> 01:41:57,029
what was that that was like in this is like a flash mob but what are they doing

666
01:42:02,619 --> 01:42:24,859
okay um speakers educational speaker oh right here and then right here now we simply need to

667
01:42:24,859 --> 01:42:29,659
link the speakers to the ring-tailed lemurs just like you did with the education board okay

668
01:42:29,659 --> 01:42:36,739
okay now i'm gonna put like 10 of these next to each other and have each one of them be a different

669
01:42:36,739 --> 01:42:49,829
animal it's gonna be unfucking bearable fantastic oh it's worth remembering that education boards

670
01:42:49,829 --> 01:42:56,550
and speakers both need power to work they won't do much good without it so any power supply

671
01:42:56,550 --> 01:43:01,829
it looks as though our vet has completed their research on ring-tailed lemurs we'll need to

672
01:43:01,829 --> 01:43:07,590
collect the results we can do that by clicking on the notification or by going back into the vet

673
01:43:07,590 --> 01:43:15,670
research area okay let's take it up go on okay what do you got collect my research just so you

674
01:43:15,670 --> 01:43:21,029
know vets will continue to research an animal even after successfully completing a research

675
01:43:21,029 --> 01:43:27,350
level take them off i suppose when you're in the zone you're in the zone ring-tailed lemur level

676
01:43:27,350 --> 01:43:32,710
six now that we've enriched the lives of our guests let's enrich the lives of our ring-tailed

677
01:43:33,109 --> 01:43:37,829
well i gotta collect the research some animals like lemurs will have a climbing need that means

678
01:43:37,829 --> 01:43:42,069
they have a requirement for a certain amount of climbing space and you can fulfill that

679
01:43:42,069 --> 01:43:46,710
requirement by building them a climbing frame okay we'll hope let's find out how much more

680
01:43:46,710 --> 01:43:52,229
climbing space our lemur friends need shall we select one of them and bring up their information

681
01:43:52,229 --> 01:44:01,880
panel so how many you need oh wow they hate this next click on the terrain tab they need land area

682
01:44:01,880 --> 01:44:05,880
they don't care about water you can see they need climbing zones quite a lot more climbing

683
01:44:05,880 --> 01:44:10,760
space but as it happens i've already got a climbing frame blueprint built for you so you

684
01:44:10,760 --> 01:44:16,760
can either pop that down or build one yourself from scratch by the way it's not always just

685
01:44:16,760 --> 01:44:21,000
climbing needs that you have to worry about this thing other animals might need a certain amount

686
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:26,439
of water in their habitat so they can go for a swim they certainly do keep us on our toes

687
01:44:27,399 --> 01:44:57,100
wow look at this but what i can just make my own no wait hold on move get rid of this

688
01:45:08,619 --> 01:45:32,359
so you have a huge view no i want give me the small one too tall give him a space to go out

689
01:45:33,159 --> 01:45:45,060
no not yet not yet that's for like in like in like 20 minutes all right i want to like hold on

690
01:45:45,060 --> 01:46:13,960
it's not snapped to surface here we go i want to bring this up there we go like come on get on there

691
01:46:13,960 --> 01:46:54,539
what this one that'll stand right is that enough i know it's disgusting but it doesn't matter

692
01:46:55,100 --> 01:47:01,640
environment what do you want terrain okay i need more than that all right how about um

693
01:47:04,300 --> 01:47:39,300
habitat climbable shift it around like this do they jump okay i'm gonna wrap around this way

694
01:47:40,020 --> 01:48:04,819
and then go up here what's this guy doing like i had like a what is he doing

695
01:48:05,300 --> 01:48:12,460
oh wait wait connect this all right this is gonna go a little bit higher from here

696
01:48:13,579 --> 01:48:17,979
this here how much more space do you need there we go all right now i'm gonna connect this

697
01:48:35,670 --> 01:48:47,560
that does not look stable at all that's very that's like dad dad's first tree house for the kids no

698
01:48:47,560 --> 01:48:52,300
it's not that's huge and horrible i would never want a child on this all right that looks good

699
01:48:52,300 --> 01:49:01,350
so that's they got their climbable area now what else they need social enrichment

700
01:49:02,840 --> 01:49:18,039
species toy enrichment okay so they need oh well hold on he loves it he loves it

701
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:29,829
well he's having so much fun he just he just jumped from here to there look at how high up this is

702
01:49:29,829 --> 01:49:49,579
he just did he shit i think god you gotta go up to the very top oh he's got itchy ears now take it

703
01:49:49,579 --> 01:49:56,090
away from him tell him make him learn life is cruel this would cost more money to dismantle

704
01:49:56,090 --> 01:50:11,829
than it did to put up don't miss don't miss that's dangerous oh look at that one all the

705
01:50:11,829 --> 01:50:33,420
way to the top yeah whoa oh that was insane i can't believe you made that can you get down

706
01:50:33,420 --> 01:51:02,779
is this a baby does tail up mean like i'm scared oh no no it's good go for it again let's see the

707
01:51:02,779 --> 01:51:16,199
jump again come on impress us big jump nice nice that was cool you guys didn't like my structure

708
01:51:16,199 --> 01:51:20,600
and now you say that's like the favorite thing in the world all right we need some uh toy shit

709
01:51:21,479 --> 01:51:34,470

01:52:46,439 --> 01:52:51,779
are you all right though like overall you're okay we need to expand it

716
01:52:57,029 --> 01:53:06,010

753
02:02:00,979 --> 02:02:27,159
gonna be a big bug encasement here that'll wrap this way okay then over here i want to extend out

754
02:02:27,159 --> 02:02:45,699
a little bit more and then we'll go up this way okay oops no that's fine and then i don't want

it anywhere i guess could i angle it let me see if i can angle this can i angle it down i guess

975
02:53:19,639 --> 02:53:29,219
that defeats the entire purpose of a solar panel that looks a little better all right so now

976
02:53:30,940 --> 02:53:33,819
all right now it's time to get a real animal in here this is going back here

977
02:53:36,149 --> 02:53:49,020
i'm bringing in something ridiculous i want like how about hmm i want to have like the

1009
03:00:18,329 --> 03:00:27,559
in so we need some we need to dig up some water very important they need critical size or crowding

1010
03:00:27,559 --> 03:00:40,059
issues um okay well first of all let's do water terrain uh sculpting so we need to go down

1011
03:00:42,629 --> 03:00:46,149
we told you how big does this shit need to be this is like the whole park

1012
03:00:47,030 --> 03:00:51,829
i can fix it it's all right all right so let me go to size drop the intensity drop the size

1013
03:00:52,469 --> 03:01:03,290
this would be the little the little area over here i can't really see what the fuck i'm doing

1014
03:01:03,290 --> 03:01:15,690
how deep does this need to be this looks too deep actually they do want deep water don't they

1015
03:01:27,059 --> 03:01:40,299
need more intensity okay how's that maybe a little bit more what does too deep mean for

1016
03:01:40,299 --> 03:01:54,860
a crocodile they can swim right that's true yeah that's completely right it's gonna have to be

1017
03:01:54,860 --> 03:02:15,110
like 80 of their enclosure right they want to like swim around okay then they can well that's too

1018
03:02:15,110 --> 03:02:31,750
much hold on bring that i have to bring this back up okay they need like a place to come out and eat

1019
03:02:31,750 --> 03:02:47,750
though flatten to surface oh i like that take this take this out oh i'm making like man-made rocks

1020
03:02:48,549 --> 03:03:07,180
no it's gotta go this way stop stop stop stop what the fuck are you doing the size is too big

1021
03:03:07,180 --> 03:03:18,180
that's the problem okay here we go it's it's like bumpy and rocky it doesn't have to be perfect

1022
03:03:28,700 --> 03:03:36,600
this is huge i think i'm good this is huge this is absolutely massive plus they need a place to

1090
03:19:55,989 --> 03:20:08,020
and enjoy the alligators from a really cool angle this isn't alive oh here we go people are figuring

1091

1094
03:20:41,770 --> 03:20:53,379
suck so bad people need to seriously come here and figure this out just that was a long throw

1095
03:20:55,239 --> 03:20:59,079
they'll figure it out eventually that's a staff door get the fuck away from the staff door

1096
03:20:59,639 --> 03:21:05,879
the path is not connected yes it is people are walking up how is this not connected

1097
03:21:11,000 --> 03:21:21,370
okay i feel like this doesn't this doesn't need to exist but it does all right do they have water

1098
03:21:21,370 --> 03:21:26,500
this is water technically right yeah all right the next thing i want to make i'm going to do

1099
03:21:26,500 --> 03:21:34,059
we're going to go this way and in here there's going to be two viewing levels of fucking elephants

1100
03:21:34,059 --> 03:21:44,379
i have no idea uh i don't need this right now i'm just moving right barrier what do i want to make

1101
03:21:44,379 --> 03:21:58,860
here no i want to make the uh the ones i can jump around the lemurs maybe a bunch of flamingos

1102
03:22:04,360 --> 03:22:12,819
this used to be roach ranch well not anymore because okay here we go ring-tailed lemurs so

1103
03:22:12,819 --> 03:22:25,770
what do they need they need all right uh so africa madagascar tropical biome grade one climb proof

1104
03:22:29,690 --> 03:22:38,780
uh doesn't matter what it is grade six semi-transparent not climbable

1105
03:22:39,659 --> 03:23:04,020
oh this would be nice because they can now they can turn around look at this way too

1106
03:23:04,579 --> 03:23:21,610
this would be cool this would be where they sleep and then i can all right i'm gonna i gotta get

1107
03:23:21,610 --> 03:23:33,510
rid of this wait this is an electric fence that'll be all right let us not turn it on all right pause

1108
03:23:33,510 --> 03:23:51,780
it for a second how do i tie this okay it's gonna go this way and it'll connect right here

1109
03:23:52,899 --> 03:23:56,420
yeah i'll deal with that later it's gonna connect right there and then it can go around and there

1110
03:23:56,420 --> 03:24:09,719
we go yeah you got it you understand let's keep going what are you doing this no stop stop what

1111
03:24:09,719 --> 03:24:17,750
are you doing so they can look down into the enclosure and they'll be able to see it they'll

1112
03:24:17,750 --> 03:24:23,989
be able to jump up and like look at them and stuff right that's big enough for the lemurs i think

1113
03:24:23,989 --> 03:24:45,129
yeah oh it needs to be higher well i mean it's not a t-rex so it doesn't need to be that high

1114
03:24:46,969 --> 03:24:54,020
no because then they can't see over this no no i want it down here it has to be below this so

1115
03:24:54,020 --> 03:25:11,590
they can look in this is a high security lemur all right so there we go now okay lemurs climbable

1116
03:25:11,590 --> 03:25:18,069
right okay um i have to build this out oh there's already cool stuff here

1117
03:25:19,540 --> 03:25:31,239
holy shit that's awesome oh that's so cool look at how cool this is all right oh it's gonna go

1118
03:25:31,239 --> 03:25:50,840
like this in the corner can they jump they go from here to there are they smart enough for that

1119
03:25:51,559 --> 03:26:09,559
so how are you supposed to keep them in i want a huge jump no fuck this delete this

1120
03:26:10,520 --> 03:26:26,020

03:28:24,629 --> 03:28:33,819
the whole thing no i gotta change that angle they have to stay in the enclosure oh check this shit

1127
03:28:33,819 --> 03:29:05,899
out you guys are gonna lose your minds and you see this one why can you go this high

1128
03:29:09,209 --> 03:29:16,579
so instead of building a satellite why can i do this still i should be stopped shouldn't i be

1129
03:29:16,579 --> 03:30:01,139
stopped by now honestly why can i keep going is there a skybox oh shit

1130
03:30:14,950 --> 03:30:18,950
not rapture what was it called the other one the one that was high and not low

1131
03:30:23,959 --> 03:30:47,819
no you can't why is this allowed let's try turning it this way now check this shit already

1132
03:30:48,459 --> 03:30:58,920
there's gonna be a huge jump do you think we can make it just do a second zoo up here this is the

1133
03:30:58,920 --> 03:31:20,739
lemur portion all right i gotta make it so it's it's doable so it's right here and then that's

1134
03:31:20,739 --> 03:31:40,059
doable right and then they can get down all right this is gonna come back into the enclosure

1135
03:31:41,270 --> 03:31:53,079
wait where is where is their enclosure oh over there okay god i have to i have to look at this

1136
03:31:53,079 --> 03:32:09,799
from like a fucked up angle it's gotta go over here and then back this way because they need to

1137
03:32:09,799 --> 03:32:39,000
be able to jump down too okay i'm getting there oh can i make this longer no i have to look at it

1138
03:32:39,000 --> 03:32:53,370
from up so that's the only way this is gonna be possible oh man no it's not what if they go the

1139
03:32:53,370 --> 03:33:04,280
other way up they won't be able to i've already i thought about that plan already and down i have

1140
03:33:04,280 --> 03:33:11,700
to get on there we go okay good almost back in the enclosure how long is this this might be better

1141
03:33:11,700 --> 03:33:35,260
actually can i keep going up though unpause for a second what do you mean unpause for a second

1142
03:33:36,299 --> 03:34:09,399
oh it stands all right okay close this is a 90 degree drop oh not quite hold on i gotta go

1143
03:34:10,280 --> 03:34:20,139
that way i mean if i'm a lemur this is probably the coolest thing i've ever seen in my whole life

1144
03:34:20,139 --> 03:34:43,450
oops i mean they want to be up high all right that's good there we go can they make the jump

1224
03:59:13,129 --> 03:59:27,930

1225
03:59:27,930 --> 03:59:44,950
high and it's all fucked up uh i mean this is not even part of an enclosure i'm just waiting for

1226
03:59:44,950 --> 04:00:00,229
one of them to accidentally jump on it though enrichment come on god damn it no come on get on

1227
04:00:00,229 --> 04:01:05,079
these it's outside the fence if that's what it is it could be right so so what do i need to go to

1228
04:01:05,079 --> 04:01:22,920
like out oh man no i spent so much time on that it has to work once it has to work one time

1229
04:01:22,920 --> 04:01:31,180
i'm just trying to keep it i'm trying to make it so the when it goes up it stays in the enclosure

1230
04:01:31,180 --> 04:01:51,290
maybe if i go across this way it'll do it it'll do it i mean is that in it looks like it's out

1231
04:01:51,290 --> 04:02:00,819
right here it's got to be like the whole park it's saved it's saved the game is saved it's

1232
04:02:00,819 --> 04:02:32,180
saved it's saved don't worry it's saved i need to see if this works no if the game is saved the

1233
04:02:32,180 --> 04:02:55,190
game saved don't worry how do i get rid of an animal how do i get rid of an animal just leave

1235
04:03:00,969 --> 04:03:08,090

1283
04:16:57,129 --> 04:17:05,850
now your terrain shelter space is critically insufficient terrain is wrong it's grass and

1284
04:17:05,850 --> 04:17:20,549
soil so we need a shitload of soil soil light make this huge and just do the whole damn thing

1285
04:17:21,190 --> 04:17:45,670
okay good short grass perfect shelter where is your shelter here it is a basic shelter

1286
04:17:49,850 --> 04:18:18,579
very nice place to sleep what's wrong with this what's wrong with this why is it still zero

1287
04:18:22,899 --> 04:18:50,360
how's that zero they want privacy where's this lemur where are you okay now habitat's fine okay

1288
04:18:51,319 --> 04:19:00,280

1327
04:29:06,620 --> 04:29:12,780
yeah i know that's why it's like it's definitely possible now let's do some platforms climbable

1328
04:29:12,860 --> 04:29:23,979
ramp or a climbable platform because somebody get over here and just climb that and like

1329
04:29:23,979 --> 04:29:32,840
go from here to here and there to there right somebody just do it it's raining again no it

04:29:48,389 --> 04:30:02,219
30 to 40 more seconds and then i'm moving on get right all this shit oh this is possible

1332
04:30:02,860 --> 04:30:07,450
thinking about it thinking about it thinking about it thinking about it where are you going

1333
04:30:12,520 --> 04:30:23,909
no do that over here over this way you idiot why would the other lemurs so much more climbing

1334
04:30:23,909 --> 04:31:08,760

1336
04:31:13,639 --> 04:31:18,600
don't want even go over here we had lemurs in the last game and all they did was jump around in

1337
04:31:18,600 --> 04:31:28,420
circles all right back to the real game it's so disappointing when you try to do something

1338
04:31:28,420 --> 04:31:47,559
like that it just fucking doesn't play out it's disappointing it's a zoo not a circus i know

1339
04:31:49,270 --> 04:31:53,829
all right i'm still doing lemurs oh fuck i forgot it was here still

1343
04:32:24,420 --> 04:32:33,239
the all the bugs are in bad shape it's because they all hate the environment i know well i'm

1344
04:32:33,239 --> 04:32:42,540
gonna release half of them into the wild so who cares it's this one they don't like to be together

1345
04:32:43,500 --> 04:32:51,000
there are too many giant cockroaches in here so i'm gonna get rid of them

1355
04:34:48,759 --> 04:34:52,040
in the very rare event that the lemurs actually give a shit and do something with it so we're

1356
04:34:52,040 --> 04:34:57,479
going to do an actual lemur in enclosure we're going to delete this business electric fence still

like six or like four two males two females there we go thirteen thousand dollars

1646
05:52:43,139 --> 05:52:46,419

and a bunch of rock okay so it's short grass bring up the size here do the whole thing short

1652
05:53:43,659 --> 05:53:51,659
grass because you don't like long grass at all all right so now we're going to do a little bit of

2068
07:32:22,580 --> 07:32:33,240
for the 250 hey what's been the greatest day of your life ever so far um that's tough greatest

2069
07:32:33,240 --> 07:32:46,459
day of my life ever as i don't know hmm i don't i can't answer that there's been too many things

2070
07:32:46,459 --> 07:32:55,930
that it could have been that you know what probably probably when i got the message

2071
07:32:56,569 --> 07:33:03,979
from and now this guy this company like sucks okay i know but when i like got my you are

2072
07:33:03,979 --> 07:33:11,180
partnered from machinima message like eight years ago that was like holy shit this is the

2073
07:33:11,180 --> 07:33:14,619
greatest thing this is the greatest day of my life i was like wow this is fucking awesome

2074
07:33:17,930 --> 07:33:31,180
i was like that was like pretty cool that was a big deal that's what a shitty life no no no no no

2075
07:33:31,180 --> 07:33:37,830
you gotta remember i'm talking about like eight and that like eight and a half years ago because

2076
07:33:37,830 --> 07:33:45,459
like the youtube ad program and making money on ads on youtube that that like started just barely

2077
07:33:45,459 --> 07:33:53,319
like seven and a half eight and a half years ago they never used to be like that so essentially i

2078
07:33:53,319 --> 07:33:58,759
was being told hey uh the views on your on your videos are now going to make money it was the

2079
07:33:58,759 --> 07:34:07,509
first time it had ever been a thing so it was like what the fuck are you serious and then that

2080
07:34:07,509 --> 07:34:11,430
company made a series of some of the worst business decisions you probably could ever make in your

2081
07:34:11,430 --> 07:34:15,509
whole life and like they went through like four ceos and turns out one of the ceos i think went

2082
07:34:15,509 --> 07:34:32,090
to jail and uh the whole company got liquidated so okay turn turn the clock forward 10 years

2083
07:34:32,169 --> 07:34:49,540
happy ending but that was a different time period on youtube it really was just nobody knew anything

2084
07:34:49,540 --> 07:34:55,939
nobody knew what the hell they were doing there was no formula it was just you just did whatever

2085
07:35:02,709 --> 07:35:08,779
but the golden age of youtube i don't know if i would call that the golden age of youtube i

2086
07:35:08,779 --> 07:35:16,459
would call probably you know here stamp this i would say like 2013 like 2012 to like you know

2087
07:35:16,459 --> 07:35:24,459
2013 to like 2015 that like two year span of like two or three years was i think the best uh the

2088
07:35:24,459 --> 07:35:37,180
most fun i ever had on youtube between like 2012 and like 2014 2015 a two year span of two to three

2089
07:35:37,180 --> 07:35:47,819
years yeah that's exactly yeah 2013 especially i think it was i was having the most fun ever

2090
07:35:48,540 --> 07:35:53,419
you talk about oh what's like the greatest day ever i don't know when when castle griffinstein

2091
07:35:53,419 --> 07:36:05,770
got uploaded that was just i just loved every second of what i was doing i'm serious but we

2092
07:36:05,770 --> 07:36:17,959
could reminisce all day german rumble live too but that was also that was kind of at the tail end

2093
07:36:17,959 --> 07:36:28,790
though and then they made all kinds of ad friendly decisions and changing the way the site works and

2094
07:36:28,790 --> 07:36:35,509
what constitutes a view and what constitutes engagement and then what happened is he started

2095
07:36:35,509 --> 07:36:40,630
having people just feed into engagement and it wasn't about getting clicks anymore is about

2096
07:36:40,630 --> 07:36:47,430
making people stay and watch and watch a bunch of ads and mid rolls and then i was it was kind of

2097
07:36:47,430 --> 07:37:06,549
like i don't i'm i'm kind of done he hates youtube no that's not true it just things changed a little

2098
07:37:06,549 --> 07:37:17,930
and i was kind of just over it so here we are now but we only have a few more left to do uh snoozing

2099
07:37:17,930 --> 07:37:21,930
copter thanks for the 250 i linked this video once but i don't remember when and you had a really

2100
07:37:22,009 --> 07:37:28,099
funny reaction so i hope to recreate that now also streaming planet zoo was my wish for today

2144
07:43:37,060 --> 07:43:42,180
um just if you're curious the number was around half a mil and that's what i was offered and i

2145
07:43:42,180 --> 07:43:45,299
wonder if you would anything you'd like to do to maybe increase that and keep me around

2146
07:43:51,580 --> 07:43:57,290
and then you get that number hey dear other platform yeah it's me yeah i considered your

2147
07:43:57,290 --> 07:44:03,770
first offer unfortunately i was uh just offered from my current platform um 600 and you know i

2148
07:44:03,770 --> 07:44:08,650
think i'm gonna have to stay all right so i mean it's that's a lot and i don't really care that

2149
07:44:08,650 --> 07:44:13,450
much unless you know there was if you had anything you wanted me hit me up you got my number

2150
07:44:14,490 --> 07:44:19,209

2151
07:44:19,209 --> 07:44:23,689
tell you something i'm really really loyal and then bang bang bang bang bang bang bang eventually

2152
07:44:23,689 --> 07:44:31,590
you get that number like 1.2 million and then you go too high and you go too far that you overbid

2153
07:44:31,590 --> 07:44:40,970
and both of them just leave so and then you just have nothing you just keep going back and forth

2154
07:44:40,970 --> 07:44:51,580
until you just lose it all that's like continuing to bet at like the roulette table just keep

2155
07:44:51,580 --> 07:44:55,580
putting down a hundred dollars and if you just keep winning over and over again and keep doubling

2213
07:54:29,430 --> 07:54:36,979
buddies who will be running the marathon and we're gonna try to we're probably gonna sell a shirt

2214
07:54:37,619 --> 07:54:45,020
and just the shirt is just any money that comes in the shirt is to sponsor his run and to uh go

07:54:45,020 --> 07:54:54,150
to the charity that all the money goes to charity so there will be there's gonna be just a there'll

2216
07:54:54,150 --> 07:55:03,500
be a charity t-shirt probably soon here so that is it's interesting that you said that because

2217
07:55:04,220 --> 07:55:10,330
we literally just talked about it like four or five three four days ago what's the schedule

2218
07:55:10,330 --> 07:55:16,180
this week um i have a doctor's appointment on thursday so i will not be around on thursday but

2219
07:55:16,180 --> 07:55:20,500
we're gonna go tomorrow dead rising and then i have a doctor's appointment on thursday and

2220
07:55:20,500 --> 07:55:28,060
i'm gonna do friday saturday sunday i'm gonna assume friday will be dead rising maybe i'll need

2221
07:55:28,060 --> 07:55:40,340
to do another stream after that we'll see outer worlds that's right i do have to play outer worlds

2222
07:55:40,340 --> 07:55:48,330
as well uh outer worlds i'm gonna tell you i'm probably not going to finish outer worlds on

2223
07:55:48,330 --> 07:55:56,009
stream we'll probably do a red dead scenario where i do it a couple of streams maybe two or three

2224
07:55:56,650 --> 07:56:05,779
and then i'm gonna finish it off stream it's not that long i know i know but still it is though

2225
07:56:05,779 --> 07:56:14,470
isn't it it's not a long wait how is it not it's not long that game sucks so nothing of value is

2226
07:56:14,470 --> 07:56:28,569
lost it's 45 hours yeah but that's still a lot 30 to 40 hours is still that's about at least four

2227
07:56:28,569 --> 07:56:37,560
streams i don't do like 10 hour streams we'll see we'll see but we'll do that after dead rising

2228
07:56:39,220 --> 07:56:45,299
and then that's no we know we got more we got more we got more unkind thanks for the 500 bits
