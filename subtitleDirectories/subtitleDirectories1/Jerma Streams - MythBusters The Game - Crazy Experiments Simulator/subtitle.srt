1
00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:23,030
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. How's it going? The title is wrong? Yeah, it's bad, isn't it?

2
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:33,880
Autocorrect and spell check have ruined society. Hold on, I'm about to burp. This is, you hear this?

3
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:41,289
This is like I'm about to burp voice. I'm holding on to it for a minute. That sounds like I'm about

4
00:00:41,289 --> 00:00:51,369
to cry. Autocorrect and spell check have ruined society. Let me tell you why. Honestly, I just

5
00:00:51,369 --> 00:00:55,289
typed shit and if it's going to be completely wrong, I don't even care. The computer is going

6
00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:03,780
to tell me what I need to fix. I just didn't right click it and fix it. I don't care, leave it.

7
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:12,870
This looks like I was shit faced. Oh yeah, let's do some science experiments, I guess.

8
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:27,370
Tweet that out. All right. Hello. Hi. I haven't seen you in four days or so. I haven't seen you

9
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:37,849
in a while. Chat immediately forgives him after chanting kill for five minutes straight.

10
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:45,500
You guys, what would you guys do with chanting kill? What's wrong with you guys? You guys need

11
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:55,620
to relax. Kill? I mean, I could understand be incredibly upset with, you know, why didn't you

12
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:00,099
write, we're upset with you. We're upset with you. We're okay from now on, right? We're upset with

13
00:02:00,099 --> 00:02:18,490
you. Not kill. Welcome to a little late night stream. Be just hanging out late night. There

14
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:27,030
was an announcement from a game that I like, which we'll be checking that out this coming week here,

15
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:36,490
I think on Thursday. Gizmo is in multiverses. He's coming to multiverses. This is literally

16
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:43,620
one of my favorite movie franchises ever made. I am going to main Gizmo. I don't care how bad

17
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:51,830
the character is with me. I don't care how bad I am with it. Gizmo from Gremlins is in multiverses.

18
00:02:51,830 --> 00:03:00,340
It's coming this week. Yeah, everybody's like, oh, yeah, I can't wait for Rick. Dude, I can't

19
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:08,340
wait. Oh, man. Oh, Walter White, maybe. Gizmo got in before all of your favorite characters.

20
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:24,039
My favorite character got in and none of you even know who it is. No, I'm very, I'm curious.

21
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:34,710
By the way, yeah, this game has mostly negative reviews on Steam. I don't, I don't, I just,

22
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:39,030
we were in pre-stream and I was like, you know what, fine, I'll put it, how about Mythbusters?

23
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:45,449
This is a mostly negative game. Is it going to be, is it that bad? I don't think so. Wait,

24
00:03:45,449 --> 00:04:02,740
let's check it out. Mostly negative. The other options were worse. Excuse me.

25
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:22,819
Cult of the Lamb and 20 minutes till dawn. Excuse me. I'm very curious. Let's try it.

26
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:26,500
What if this is amazing? What if you guys, okay, what if this is really fun?

27
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:41,779
I'm ready. I'm ready to do some experiments. A bad review game usually is a good game for you.

28
00:04:43,769 --> 00:05:04,220
For you. All right. Let's go. I'm ready to play. I think I have it set to go. Bane. Yep. Oh,

29
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:11,350
hold on a second. Wait. No, I'm not going to say it. There's a ton of new people in the community

30
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:15,959
over the last year or so. Should we get a new opinion on the Bane voice? I feel like there's

31
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:24,600
a lot of new people here over the last 24 months. I feel like it's going to be,

32
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:29,160
I think people are going to like it. I think people will think it's good. There's so much

33
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:36,389
more people here. There's so much more of a sample. All right. Let's go. Here it is. And

34
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:44,920
snap my fingers. Snap. There I am too. I wasn't naked in that frame, but whatever. I don't care.

35
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:59,670
All right. Let's go. Mythbusters crazy experiments simulator. Are we all here? Should I go? Oh,

36
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:09,399
you need to hear the music. All right. Let's go. So what do you do? We pick an X. Whoa,

37
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:17,639
this is crashing my computer. Hold on. Welcome to Mythbusters the game. Soon you'll be able to play

38
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:22,120
the role of a real Mythbuster. Each myth will have its own unique gameplay mechanics, which

39
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,000
you will encounter during the finalization and testing of the experiment. Have fun. Let's go.

40
00:06:27,639 --> 00:07:02,019
This is okay. Hold on. It's 1.0. God damn it. I can't make it lower than this. I got to go

41
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:12,100
into my actual mouse DPI. Is it mouse settings? Right? Mouse settings. Cursor speed. Let's put it

42
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:30,540
at, I don't know, like here. Myth busted. Yeah. Okay. Let me see if that helps. All right. I don't

43
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:46,040
know what to do. I just turned my mouse sensitivity at a hardware level down. Can I? How do I fix this?

44
00:07:46,040 --> 00:08:01,370
How do I fix this? Lower your DPI? Isn't that what I just did? Hold on. Is this DPI? Hold on.

45
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:08,459
Hardware. Wheel pointer options. Pointer speed. How do I turn the DPI down on my fucking mouse?

46
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:24,949
Cursor speed is not DPI. Well, where's DPI? It's not in Windows. Where is it? Wait, it's not Windows

47
00:08:24,949 --> 00:08:34,860
mouse speed? Whatever. Okay. I'll deal with it. Can I use the controller? Okay. Go to the myth board

48
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:43,690
in order to choose a myth. Not a whole lot going on here. That's like we, we got one. It's our,

49
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:55,750
put it on, stick it on the wall. We're about to make our first $40. Okay. Heroes Gambit.

50
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:59,509
Action movie heroes tend to find ways to survive a grenade blast within seconds.

51
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:03,110
Is it possible to survive a grenade explosion by covering it with an object

52
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:08,789
and hiding behind a suitable cover? Bucket? A barrel? Or maybe a wooden box? What would be

53
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:17,879
the best way to stop the explosion? Why are we jumping on grenades? Oh, plug with the Mythbusters,

54
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:24,200
man. First myth of the day. Gary's going to jump on a grenade and fucking explode. And we'll see

55
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:35,419
how many, what's the point of this? It's going to be one episode of this show. Um, okay. Uh, okay.

56
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:39,820
Unlock experience. Run for your life. Test the firepower of a grenade. Save the mock-up from...

57
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:47,720
Okay. So I accept it. Now you're going to pick the first myth for testing. The goal of the game is

58
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:54,009
to get as popular as possible while still having enough budget for your experiments. During the

59
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:59,990
game, you will get cards to assemble episodes. Wait, we have to actually make the show?

60
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:06,059
Appropriate usage of those cards in the episode will allow you to gain higher popularity and budget.

61
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:15,690
All right. All right. Let's go. Here's my, here's my team. Okay. This is celebrities can make the

62
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:22,440
audience stick around. His knowledge will be an immense help during your endeavors. And he has

63
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:30,679
been working with guns and explosives for years. Well, I mean, it's going to be this guy. You bring

64
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:42,279
the explosives expert. You don't, I mean, yeah, that's correct. Right. Let's go. So how do we do

65
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:53,580
the experiment? How to survive a grenade. It's called pick it up off the ground and throw it back.

66
00:10:55,029 --> 00:11:09,299
Let's see. How's that? Okay. Test the firepower of a grenade. What's going on? Wait, hold on. My

67
00:11:09,299 --> 00:11:16,970
brain is confused. Where are we? Test the firepower of a grenade. Save the mock-up from,

68
00:11:17,929 --> 00:11:37,509
All right. Click and drag to throw the ball. There's drop it on my leg. What happened?

69
00:11:37,509 --> 00:12:00,090
This is a long cook time on this grenade. Did I do it? It was a grenade. Determine the area

70
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:09,399
percentage. Click within a body to fill it. What? What happened? Wait, what? I don't understand

71
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:17,610
what's happening. Click within a body to fill it. Select apply button. How, it has to be at 5%.

72
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:44,389
I'm so confused. What's happening? The right side. What does it want me to do? Are you sure? I don't

73
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:54,789
know what it's asking. Read the number on the right. Fill 36%. I mean, this is like 36.

74
00:12:55,909 --> 00:13:02,840
Okay. Oh, all right. I get it. I get it. Okay. Wait. Oh, we're making the grenade. I get it. All

75
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:07,750
right. Oh, this is easy. I get it. Oh my God. I just, I don't like this. Okay. We need to move.

76
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:11,990
Oh my, what? I thought I was going to be playing with, I thought I was going to be playing,

77
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:24,730
whatever. You know what I'm trying to say. Move the tiles. I have 44 moves left. Oh Jesus Christ.

78
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:36,460
Okay. Hold on. I just have to do it, right? That's it. I don't have to do anything fancy.

79
00:13:37,929 --> 00:13:45,059
All right. Let's go. Solve the equation by moving the specified number of sticks.

80
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:58,789
I don't think they did this on the show. Okay. Seven times three equals nine plus I can move

81
00:13:58,789 --> 00:14:05,909
two sticks. This is just those, the book of bathroom brain teasers that I used to have.

82
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:21,000
What's the answer? I don't even care. One times three, one times three equals seven times three

83
00:14:22,379 --> 00:14:37,620
equals nine, 10 to the 12, 13, 14, 15. That's not, that's not 21. 78. What is it? Seven times two.

84
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:51,940
All right. Seven times two. How do I do that? No. All right. We made the grenade. All right. I made

85
00:14:51,940 --> 00:15:06,220
the grenade. I got it. Okay. Time to do it. Run for, prepare the grenade and build a test mockup.

86
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:09,340
When you are ready, place everything on the testing grounds. The test mockup does not get

87
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:27,799
destroyed. Okay. Additional objectives. All right. Okay. Page number, shooting range. Oh, okay. Throw

88
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:33,460
the grenade. Yeah. Whatever. Whatever. I don't fucking care. Let's go. Let's go to the, let's

89
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:45,210
go to the fun part where I can experiment. All right. Assembly mode. Look, I just want to be the

90
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:49,370
fucking celebrity that walks on and just has the safety goggles and is like,

91
00:15:51,049 --> 00:15:55,210
that's all my lines. I don't do anything. I have my own air conditioned trailer.

92
00:15:55,769 --> 00:16:17,990
What are the two songs playing? $150 for a hammer. What? I have to build the grenade?

93
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:34,039
No, we just buy the grenade. I don't want to build a grenade. Okay. I need nails. One nail. I need

94
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:48,299
six planks. Oh my God. This looks like I don't want to even be in this room. I need a wood saw.

95
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:58,440
Where's my actual money? My popularity is a thousand. Okay. Buy a grenade. Buy this thing.

96
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:06,630
I need six wooden planks. How many do these do I need? How many nails?

97
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:22,819
Seven nails. How many do I have? Okay. What is this? Why would I buy saws? Spending all my money.

98
00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:28,819
By the way, isn't this my workshop? Why would I need to buy things in my own workshop?

99
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:37,029
All right. Wooden plank. I need six. They don't show this process on TV.

100
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:55,000
All right. Check your notebooks on page three. Okay. Oh, okay. Let's build it. Well,

101
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:12,920
this is where the music is coming from. Craft. A piezoelectric grenade. Remove the grenade fuse.

102
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:25,480
I want to remove the grenade fuse. Okay. Mount a grenade to mount a grenade.

103
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:41,210
How you so fused by holding down? I would not want to be in this room. Okay. Okay. This is my

104
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:48,660
grenade. This is my Molotov grenade. All right. So now what do I do with this? Move wrench to the

105
00:18:48,660 --> 00:19:08,650
tool belt. Where's the wrench? Oh, okay. And hammer on the tool belt too, right? Is this a detonator?

106
00:19:09,619 --> 00:19:27,369
All right. Let's go. I got that. Close backpack. Tab. Choose wrench. You bet your ass I'm trying

107
00:19:27,369 --> 00:19:36,420
to throw it. I can't throw it. All right. What do I do now? No, no, I don't want another one.

108
00:19:38,579 --> 00:20:05,480
So check your notebook page four. Assemble the saw. Page four. Please refer to page five.

109
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:12,859
Okay. Assemble the saw. I think that I just have to get this stuff ready, right? Prepare the saw for

110
00:20:12,859 --> 00:20:28,380
cutting. All right. Let's go. Wrong tool. I need a wrench. Okay. Ooh. Satisfying sound effects.

111
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:42,410
Okay. The machine's ready to work. So what do I do now?

112
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:50,839
Don't lie down. Don't like put your neck under here. All right. I'm ready to work.

113
00:20:52,279 --> 00:21:03,480
That's not good. Get me out of this. Okay. Cool. So it's assembled, right? We're good. Using the saw,

114
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:21,609
get wooden beam piece. Okay. How do I use it? What the fuck was that? Oh, okay. I get it.

115
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:38,440
Wooden plank piece. You don't want to be going fast in this environment. There should be points

116
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:55,319
for speed. Okay. So I got everything. Check your notebook. What's wrong with my drugs? What's wrong

117
00:21:55,319 --> 00:22:12,470
with my face? All right. Now what? What page am I on? All right. So I need a hammer.

118
00:22:13,109 --> 00:22:22,170
Okay. I need a hammer. I got a hammer. Hammer. Go to the big workshop and make a mock-up.

119
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:43,019
Oh, all right. Here we go. Test mock-up. I don't want to. I just, I'll be honest,

120
00:22:43,019 --> 00:22:48,569
I just didn't want to read any of that. I didn't want to read any of it. Any of it. I didn't read

121
00:22:48,569 --> 00:23:12,069
a sentence. It's good, right? Okay. It's in. Now we, what the fuck am I making? What is this?

122
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:32,359
I'm making a shitty mailbox for like my second grade class. What is this supposed to be? Um,

123
00:23:33,640 --> 00:24:13,210
middle with bonnet, middle with cowboy hat. Oh, you bet your ass. If I was on this episode,

124
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:16,890
I would be like, yeah, let me do it. I'd be like hitting it with the hammer and I would hit it hard

125
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:31,349
and put, pretend my thumb got hit and go like, oh, and put it like into my mouth and shit. What

126
00:24:31,349 --> 00:24:46,869
am I doing? Why? What am I doing with this? Okay. Put it on the truck. Okay. Head to the shooting

127
00:24:46,869 --> 00:25:18,039
range. How? Oh, okay. Shooting range. Okay. The cleanup crew is coming. So what? Check your

128
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:32,170
notebook on page six. Start the myth and activate explosives. Use to reduce the radius of the

129
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:38,390
explosion with shields. Used to reduce the radius of the explosion and space for all large tests.

130
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:48,460
What do you, what do you want? Lethal zone. Okay. Here you will start the experiment and start the

131
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:52,940
test sequence. You will need to have an appropriate tool in order to start. I need a button. Okay.

132
00:25:53,660 --> 00:26:16,710
Take the test mock up to the say, all right, let's go. Where is it? It's on the truck. Okay.

133
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:19,589
We didn't really need to bring the whole truck for this. I got to put this in the back of

134
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:28,230
somebody's car. We didn't need to bring the truck for one item. Where is it? Where's my cardboard

135
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:35,269
cutout? Take the test mock up to the safe zone. Where is it? I loaded it in the truck. What

136
00:26:35,269 --> 00:26:58,490
happened? It escaped. What? Dude, you're the test. Is it in my inventory? No. Where is it?

137
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:44,579
What happened? It's behind the truck. What? No, it's not. Where is it? Hey, where is it?

138
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:54,890
Uh, is it, is it not there? Did I, is it, am I soft-locked? I have to make a new one, loser.

139
00:27:55,450 --> 00:28:10,819
Go to the shooting range. It was on the stand there. Was it? Well, I told me,

140
00:28:10,819 --> 00:28:22,069
I didn't have to take it out of the truck. Who do you think drove you there?

141
00:28:22,869 --> 00:28:35,720
That's funny. Where is he? Where is this thing? Where is this guy? I'm serious. Where is he?

142
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:47,539
The grenade's still on the shop's table. No, it's not. I have it in my inventory.

143
00:28:47,779 --> 00:29:02,980
That guy didn't want to die. Where is he? Look behind you on a stand. It's not here.

144
00:29:05,339 --> 00:29:20,569
No, behind you. Check the box, maybe. I think I have, I think it's fucked up. I think it's

145
00:29:20,569 --> 00:29:37,450
screwed up. I think I have to restart it. Large menu items. It's in the house. It's where the

146
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:50,019
arrow is pointing. Yeah, there's nothing there. I can't do anything about it. Yeah, take the

147
00:29:50,019 --> 00:30:15,369
test mock-up to the safe zone, which is here. Walks in front of the truck. Shit! Wait, what's

148
00:30:15,369 --> 00:30:36,839
this? What's this? No. Wait, was it really? It was not there. I think it's gone. I just think it's

149
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:48,819
gone. Okay. I don't know what, I don't even know what items those were. Did I actually lose it?

150
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:16,710
Fuck. I actually think it's screwed up. Oh, that's not good. What do I do? Should I start over?

151
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:24,069
I don't think I want to start. Should I start over, man? I feel like all you guys are going to

152
00:31:24,069 --> 00:31:43,930
leave. Who raided? Is it Raid? I don't even see who, I can't see who raided. Who didn't rejoin?

153
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:52,900
Wait, who? Slime? Slimesicle Raid, what's up? Hey, we just started the stream. Thanks a lot.

154
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:57,220
Slimesicle, appreciate it. Welcome everybody from Slimesicle's stream. We're just getting started

155
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:04,200
here. Gonna be busting some myths. Just turned the stream on for the first time. You joined at the

156
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:14,309
perfect opportunity. Time to bust some myths. What do we got today for our first one? Run for

157
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:37,259
your life? What, I have to make a grenade? This is fucking different than last time. What? What?

158
00:32:37,819 --> 00:33:26,890
Did I win? Skip it. Skip. I don't care. Why can't I move this one? Fuck. Just skip it.

159
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:56,660
Fail it over and over again. Look, I'm too stupid. See? All right, we got the grenade. We're good.

160
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:24,869
Okay, cool. Yep. Well, got it. All right, let's go get the items. How many nails? Seven? One?

161
00:34:24,869 --> 00:34:46,820
Wasn't it seven? It was seven nails last time. I'm so confused. What's wrong with my guy? This

162
00:34:46,820 --> 00:35:11,179
fucking music is fucked. How many do I? Wooden, three wooden planks. I need the start button.

163
00:35:11,179 --> 00:36:01,190
Okay, cool. Yep, I got it. I won't laugh. You laugh, you lose. If I laugh, I have to turn the

164
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:22,360
stream off. Why turn the music down? This doesn't count. This doesn't count. The music is at fucking

165
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:32,869
zero percent. Okay, it was the radio. No, starting now. That doesn't count. Starting now. Starting

166
00:36:32,869 --> 00:38:00,250
now. If I laugh, I'll turn the stream off. Where's the sound? Why is there no sound? This is going

167
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:39,210
to get DMCA. Whatever. I don't really care. We're just doing just generic. Just generic. I'm not

168
00:38:39,210 --> 00:39:11,369
adding anything weird. Just right side, left. Just generic. Okay, take item. I'm holding it in my

169
00:39:11,369 --> 00:39:23,909
hands right now. Into the truck. Bring it to the truck. Okay, I'm in the truck. Drop in the truck.

170
00:39:23,909 --> 00:39:33,510
That didn't do that last time. I don't know what it did last time, but not that. I'm ready. I'm

171
00:39:33,510 --> 00:41:14,570
running to the beat. Let's go. There we go. Yes. What? Hey, hey, hey. What do I do? I don't know

172
00:41:14,570 --> 00:42:10,949
what to do. What's the point of this guy? What's the point of this guy? Leave it on the board?

173
00:42:10,949 --> 00:42:42,579
Put the Tessa objects in the appropriate slots and protect them from the explosion. I can't

174
00:42:42,579 --> 00:43:44,739
fucking take it anymore. It's been six minutes. I've turned it off. Wow. Whoa. Wait, I can edit

175
00:43:44,739 --> 00:44:12,280
the episode? Okay, go to your laptop. There's shit everywhere. Okay, I can edit the video.

176
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:20,179
That scared me. I didn't know what that was. That was actually terrifying. Okay,

177
00:44:20,179 --> 00:44:30,219
find nice messages from fans. Okay. Progress and then the Mythmaker Studio. All right, let's go

178
00:44:30,219 --> 00:44:35,619
for it. Each episode has five empty slots that can be filled with collected cards. All right,

179
00:44:35,619 --> 00:44:45,420
we had Sergeant. We said Sergeant Daniel is there. Each episode is 45 minutes. Wait,

180
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:57,030
we're going to spend 20 minutes targeting Sergeant Daniel? Sounds pretty good to me.

181
00:45:12,739 --> 00:45:17,539
Good afternoon. We have a great idea for an experiment. Consider this. Can a chair with

182
00:45:17,539 --> 00:45:24,489
enough balloons fly? I hope we understand each other. Waiting for some good material. That means

183
00:45:24,489 --> 00:45:32,519
they don't like the show. Your show is really nice. I like it very much. I like it. Good show. Good

184
00:45:32,519 --> 00:45:44,519
luck in your future endeavors. Hey, thanks. Thanks, Michael Brown. Cool. All right. Do I sleep in

185
00:45:44,519 --> 00:46:00,219
this? Go to the myth board. All right. Where's the myth board? Oh, right here. Of course. Balloon

186
00:46:00,219 --> 00:46:11,239
chair. All right. I'm doing balloon chair and then I'm never playing this game again. Yeah,

187
00:46:11,239 --> 00:46:30,900
sure. I don't want to make a go. I don't want to make a grenade for the balloon chair. I don't.

188
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:53,369
I don't. What do you want me to do? Oh, I got it. All right. Cool. Sick. This game's sick.

189
00:46:53,369 --> 00:47:43,079
How many degrees does a right angle have? 90. All right, we got it. Okay. Time to go and check my

190
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:57,559
notebook. This game's cute. This game's cute. Come on. This is cute. Okay. Pork. Wait, why am I

191
00:47:57,559 --> 00:48:10,489
getting pork for? Is the Mythbuster to make like a pork chop sandwich for somebody? How many bottles?

192
00:48:10,489 --> 00:48:20,420
He loathes it. I didn't say that. How many more bottles of water do I need? Water times one. Water

193
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:24,900
times one. How many waters do? Oh, this is a bottle. Never mind. I thought it was blue. I thought

194
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:38,889
they were water bottles. Whatever. Where's the? Oh, okay. Cool. Let's assemble it. This is my

195
00:48:38,889 --> 00:49:31,449
favorite part. Go to the pump station. Gelatin in the bucket? No, not cement. What do I do?

196
00:49:31,449 --> 00:49:42,139
Press the valve? Press and hold the valve. I like the way this sounds. How do I do it?

197
00:49:42,139 --> 00:49:54,260
Where's the press and hold the valve? Check the ballistic gel proportions. What does that mean?

198
00:49:54,260 --> 00:50:11,179
I need 10 to 20 percent pork gelatin and 80 to 90 percent water. Oh, shit. Hold on. Whoa! That's way

199
00:50:11,179 --> 00:50:23,610
too much. Oops. Everybody all right? Everybody move. Nobody's got glass in them or anything?

200
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:30,420
No, I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do.

201
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:54,500
Hold on. Let's go. 20 percent. Oh, come on. 20 percent. And then 80 percent water. Like that,

202
00:50:54,500 --> 00:51:30,420
right? We good? Oh, dude. Fucking science. Ballistic gel hand? Oh, dude. Science! Do we have a

203
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:38,730
ballistic gel hand? Dude, that's only possible with freaking science. Make a second hand? Well,

204
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:55,739
why did you tell me to make? Science actually is pretty cool. It is. It's fun. Look, I will take

205
00:51:55,739 --> 00:52:02,940
science over math. I will take science over social studies. I will take science over English

206
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:23,820
class every single time. No matter what. Every time. Make a second hand? Oh, that's wrong. What

207
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:40,570
about geography? No, I would have liked school a lot more if it was 40 percent science class. Like,

208
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:53,829
20 percent gym. And then 40 percent. All right. 30 percent science. 20 percent gym. 20 percent

209
00:52:53,829 --> 00:53:11,340
lunch. And then like 30 percent like who invented stuff. That would be cool to me. Like,

210
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:15,340
inventor is 101. Like, oh, we learn about like every invention that ever was invented and who

211
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:24,010
made it and what their patents are and shit. Kind of fucking cool, don't you think? Oh, and what

212
00:53:24,010 --> 00:53:30,099
credit score is and how to write a check and what like taxes are. Would have been kind of nice if

213
00:53:30,099 --> 00:53:45,260
they told us that. You know, just saying. All right. Let's open the notebook. All right. So,

214
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:53,719
here we go. It's time to do this. I need the wrench. We're going to put the things together.

215
00:53:54,280 --> 00:54:06,219
I'm not this cute. OK, item checklist. Let's go. I'm ready. You're 40. You should know by now.

216
00:54:06,219 --> 00:54:11,449
I do now. And I have for the last probably five to 10 years. I did not know this until I was

217
00:54:11,449 --> 00:54:16,139
probably in my early to mid 20s. It took way too long. It shouldn't have. I should. It shouldn't

218
00:54:16,139 --> 00:54:28,440
have waited until I was like 25 to understand all this stuff. Like 23, 24, 25, 26. I knew what it

219
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:33,539
was, but I didn't understand how it worked. And you know what? Sometimes I still kind of don't

220
00:54:33,539 --> 00:54:40,519
understand how the fuck that works because it's different everywhere. All right. I need the parts.

221
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:52,739
The craft. The buster. Collect all the needed. Aren't they all here?

222
00:54:52,739 --> 00:54:56,980
Teenagers don't know to know credit scores. No, but teenagers that grow into adults need to know

223
00:54:56,980 --> 00:55:02,250
what a credit score is. And teenagers that grow into adults need to know about like financial

224
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:13,619
literacy and all the things that come with it. I don't know why we wait so long. OK, cool.

225
00:55:16,039 --> 00:55:27,190
Where do I get this stuff? Collect all the needed parts. What is it? I need steel rod 15. Oh,

226
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:36,150
they're not going to help me anymore. The tutorial is over. OK, I need 15 steel rods. Where are those?

227
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:49,420
Oh, just spend all my money on cement. You got it. I don't know why it feels like a Mr. Beast video.

228
00:55:49,420 --> 00:56:10,150
I filled this bowl with cement up to my neck. Uh, where is it? Steel rods. Oh, here we go.

229
00:56:10,150 --> 00:56:27,929
Steel pipe. Steel rod piece. I don't know what any of this means. Steel rod piece. Just buy five of

230
00:56:27,929 --> 00:56:32,809
them. This is what I would do. I would just buy five of these and just bring it to the contract

231
00:56:32,809 --> 00:56:37,699
and go. This might be way more, but just keep whatever you keep and use whatever you don't need.

232
00:56:37,699 --> 00:56:40,409
Like for another project, you don't have to pay me. I don't care. I just want to make sure

233
00:56:40,409 --> 00:56:53,179
it's right. All right, so 15. Oh, I need more than that. 15. Well, how many did I buy? Five. OK, 13

234
00:56:53,179 --> 00:56:57,260
screws. Any buster head, buster torso, buster pelvis, buster limb, buster hand, buster foot.

235
00:56:57,260 --> 00:57:17,659
What is that? All right, 13 screws. OK, where's buster? Buster head? Buster hand? What is that in

236
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:31,059
construction terms? What is a buster head, a buster torso, buster arm? What is that? Buster. Wait,

237
00:57:31,059 --> 00:57:37,480
where is this? Oh, it's the dummy. Where do I find the dummy? It's the name of the dummy. Well,

238
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:56,760
OK. Oh, buster. I got to cut up the steel rod. Where's the saw bench? Where's the saw bench?

239
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:03,780
I forget where it is. There it is. All right, I need steel rod piece.

240
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:14,900
Saw blade damaged? What are you talking about? The wrong material was cut. What? I broke this?

241
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:42,619
Oh, it's a wood saw. God damn it. City boy. You know why? OK, I don't know how to change

242
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:48,869
a tire either. Very, very important thing to know because I could know and I could learn,

243
00:58:48,869 --> 00:58:56,340
but I know I would screw it up. I would screw it up. And my fear of knowing that when I put that

244
00:58:56,340 --> 00:59:01,079
tire on, I'm going to get back on the fucking highway and my car is going to flip over like

245
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:08,780
GTA. Somebody that knows what they're doing has to do that, not me. I just have this crazy fear.

246
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:14,630
Oh, yeah, man. No, you're fine. Just pop the hood and connect this and then take that out

247
00:59:14,630 --> 00:59:19,639
and put this back in. My car is going to explode if I do it. I will put everything and I'll follow

248
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:24,360
the YouTube tutorial instructions or whatever, and I'll be like, OK, pause the video. Rewind 10

249
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:28,519
seconds. Watch it again to make sure I'm doing exactly what that guy just did. Verbatim with his

250
00:59:28,519 --> 00:59:34,710
hands. OK, done. When I close the lid to the engine, the car is going to explode the second

251
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:44,199
that it latches in the front. I can't. I just can't do it. I'm too afraid of it. Change a tire on

252
00:59:44,199 --> 00:59:55,980
stream. I wouldn't be able to. YouTube University. No, you don't pop the hood to change the tire.

253
00:59:55,980 --> 01:00:01,909
I'm just saying, like, in general, mechanical stuff like that I'm terrified of. It's not hard

254
01:00:01,909 --> 01:00:09,400
to change a tire. I know it doesn't matter. So, yeah, you pop the trunk, pop the hood to get to

255
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:17,510
the tire. Yeah, I'm telling you, I'm going to have the wrench in my hand. I'm going to be sitting

256
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:24,469
there like, all right, pop the tub. Pop the top of it. Yeah. Looks like that screw is loose in there.

257
01:00:24,469 --> 01:00:28,389
Yeah, kill the engine, mate. Kill the engine. Go, go, go, go, go, go. All right, let me get in there.

258
01:00:28,389 --> 01:00:33,349
And I'm going to get in there and I'm going to put the wrench around the nut or whatever.

259
01:00:33,349 --> 01:00:38,630
And I'm going to go and I'm going to wake up in front of the pearly gates. It's going to be like,

260
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:43,670
yeah, man, I'm good to go. Yeah, no, this looks good. I think this is correct. I'm awake.

261
01:00:44,710 --> 01:00:51,239
Something killed me. I just wake up at the pearly gates and fucking Peter's going to be like, wow,

262
01:00:51,239 --> 01:00:59,289
man, you don't even know how to change a tire. He just fires me down to hell. I look over and I see

263
01:00:59,289 --> 01:01:03,130
over like the pearly gates, I see like all the mechanics. They're all sitting there and they're

264
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:08,219
all like, yeah, waving to me. It's just like a shitload of mechanics and like electricians.

265
01:01:08,219 --> 01:01:28,969
What do I need? Peter Griffin is dead because bad. Wait, but hold on. It doesn't mean like

266
01:01:28,969 --> 01:01:38,980
Sekiro on stream means I get to go to heaven. And that's logic. Hold on. Why are we tying?

267
01:01:39,699 --> 01:01:45,639
Oh, why am I tying like professional skill to you go to heaven? That doesn't make any sense.

268
01:01:47,449 --> 01:01:52,409
These guys were all car mechanics. If you're not a car mechanic, you go to fucking hell.

269
01:01:53,610 --> 01:02:02,389
What am I talking about? That doesn't make any sense. This game must be pretty boring for you

270
01:02:02,389 --> 01:02:13,210
to talk about this. Playing video games with the skill is not worthy of heaven. Hey, all dogs go

271
01:02:13,210 --> 01:02:28,840
to heaven. Some dogs go to hell. Can you imagine that's the sequel? Oh, Disney presents some dogs

272
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:48,780
go to hell. Rated PG. There is a sequel. What? Do I even have this thing? No, I don't. What was

273
01:02:48,780 --> 01:03:06,699
the name? Was it all dogs go to heaven too? Colon, some dogs go to hell. Where? Okay,

274
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:10,300
I need the saw blade. I'm good. I'm good. I'm on it. I'm back on it. I'm back on it.

275
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:26,230
Do I have enough screws to put this on? Okay. Let's get back to this, please. He thinks he's

276
01:03:26,230 --> 01:03:32,780
so funny. No, I think that was funny. I don't think everything I say is funny. I think that

277
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:40,019
was genuinely humorous. Typo in the title, hee hee. You know what? Yeah, fuck that. That just sucks.

278
01:03:40,019 --> 01:03:48,730
We're getting rid of it. I'm changing it to some dogs go to hell. No, that's like weird at a context.

279
01:03:48,730 --> 01:04:12,519
Um, how about just like, science. Okay. I mean, it's only going to be the title for like another

280
01:04:12,519 --> 01:04:19,500
15 minutes, if I'm honest. Play something else. Why are you playing this and not gloom wood?

281
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:24,090
I don't know. I'll play gloom wood eventually. Is it out? I thought it wasn't out yet.

282
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:45,460
Oh, it came out in early access. Okay. There are three all dogs go to heaven movies?

283
01:04:46,019 --> 01:05:06,039
How many of these do I need? How many? Did I? How many of those do I need? All dogs go to heaven.

284
01:05:06,039 --> 01:05:13,980
Hold on. Wait, there's three movies? All dogs go to heaven. The series friends to the rescue

285
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:25,400
and all dogs Christmas carol. All dogs go to heaven too. What's the main character's name?

286
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:38,840
The dog from all dogs go to heaven. Charlie. All dogs go to heaven three. Charlie's inferno.

287
01:05:38,840 --> 01:06:05,369
Why is there a countdown? Okay. So now I need I have steel rod pieces. I need the

288
01:06:05,369 --> 01:06:27,139
I gotta hit those put Buster's head together. Buster. Here we go. Press the F, dude, please.

289
01:06:27,139 --> 01:06:52,170
What? I just did. What do you mean? What's wrong? This feels weird. Something about this just says

290
01:06:52,170 --> 01:07:01,320
this feels weird, but like somehow wrong. How do I make this? Um, okay. I need to make the head

291
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:08,219
with the no. I need to make ballistic goo. Okay. Ballistic gel head. I need. Okay. Ballistic goo.

292
01:07:08,219 --> 01:07:18,489
How do I need? What is this? Not cement or whatever it is. I don't know how much this. I

293
01:07:18,489 --> 01:07:30,900
don't know. I'm just gonna get it though. Water tank. I need a few of these. Okay. Um, is it a

294
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:56,710
ballistic Buster's torso? But is it ballistic torso? Am I missing that? Oh, there's already

295
01:07:56,710 --> 01:08:09,480
one here. All right. Um, no bottle to fill. Here we go. Okay. 20%. 90%. Is Buster already made?

296
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:44,680
What happened to it? Okay. 20%. That's it, right? 20 and what's going on? How do I get it?

297
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:54,329
It's going to blow. Just take it. Unknown substance added to backpack. That how is this

298
01:08:54,329 --> 01:09:28,859
making any sense? What am I doing wrong? It's 20% and 80% or 10% and 90%. Right? 10% 90%.

299
01:09:41,750 --> 01:10:33,819
How am I doing this wrong? 20% 80%. I did stop it at a hundred. It didn't do anything. 20%.

300
01:10:41,909 --> 01:10:56,890
I can't. If I go any more further, it's going to explode. Ballistic gel. Okay. I need poly

301
01:10:56,890 --> 01:11:06,579
polypropylene granules or ballistic gel. That's what I'm trying to make right now. Ballistic gel.

302
01:11:06,579 --> 01:11:19,510
I'm trying to make ballistic gel right now. Okay. 10 to 20% gel and 80, 90%. How is this wrong?

303
01:11:19,510 --> 01:11:39,180
Potion of helium. Is this Harry Potter? A portion of helium. Okay. Ballistic gel is I'm going to do

304
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:56,010
15%. That's 15% right there, right in the middle. And I'm going to do 85%. I would help me. What's

305
01:11:56,010 --> 01:12:16,180
happening? 15% 80, 85%. Science is magic. That's not 85. Yes, it is. Take the bottle now. It doesn't

306
01:12:16,180 --> 01:12:43,779
know what it. All right. All right. I've, I've, I've had it 15 plus 85 is a hundred. Okay. I'm doing

307
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:54,380
10, 10 and 90, 10 and 90%. It has to be correct. Didn't you want all classes to be science?

308
01:12:54,380 --> 01:13:02,579
I actually don't know what's happening. Neither do I. Imagine how gross it is if you get splashed

309
01:13:02,579 --> 01:13:09,750
with pork, gelatin and water. Yeah. This keeps hitting me right in the face. Okay. Here we go.

310
01:13:10,310 --> 01:13:39,220
I'm going to do 10 and 90. Should I do 20? 10 plus 80 is 90. Put the water in first.

311
01:13:45,289 --> 01:13:56,170
How? What am I doing wrong? Water first. I'm going to do 80%. 80% water. Now gelatin.

312
01:13:58,579 --> 01:14:06,949
I'm going to get kicked out of this place. 10 and 80. Don't fill the hole away.

313
01:14:06,949 --> 01:14:24,119
Dude, this is genuinely worse than the clock. How is this worse than the clock? I'm doing what it

314
01:14:24,119 --> 01:14:37,380
says is I'm supposed to be doing. There's your 10 and 80%. It doesn't work. Look, 15 gelatin

315
01:14:37,380 --> 01:15:09,529
and then water up to 90. Bro, none of your hypothesis works. 10 plus 70. Hey, I got a

316
01:15:09,529 --> 01:15:34,489
hypothesis. Flip the recipe. How does that sound? Didn't work. Is that pork? Yeah, it's pork gelatin.

317
01:15:34,489 --> 01:15:49,699
These jello shots. Yeah, I made jello shots with bone broth and vodka. First one to puke loses.

318
01:15:49,699 --> 01:15:54,100
Um, does anyone understand what's going on? Cause I think we've tried every combination.

319
01:15:54,100 --> 01:16:03,699
It's the wrong gelatin. Pork gelatin and water. This is pork gelatin down here.

320
01:16:03,699 --> 01:16:26,920
Take the bottle off before it explodes. Holy shit. I already did that. Why? Unknown substance.

321
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:46,119
Oh my God. How much bullshit is in here? Please tell me he's pretending. Um, all right. I am

322
01:16:46,119 --> 01:16:53,060
going to hover over gelatin and I want everyone to scream the stop sign when they want me to stop.

323
01:16:53,060 --> 01:17:15,510
I'm going to do it very slow. Yeah. Yeah. Fuck that. Look at all these people saying this shit.

324
01:17:15,510 --> 01:17:26,789
I don't get it. Oh my God. I'm screaming. Okay. How about this? This is like 15%.

325
01:17:28,420 --> 01:17:46,359
80. Like this is correct. That's correct. This is correct. More water. More water. More water. No,

326
01:17:46,359 --> 01:17:57,670
no, no, no, no. A bit more water. It's not there. The white circle is the gelatin combined. Yeah,

327
01:17:57,670 --> 01:18:08,390
I know. 80 to 90% water. That is, that is legitimately what we are looking at right now.

328
01:18:08,390 --> 01:18:12,390
This is legitimately, legitimately what we're looking at. He's definitely not sober. Yes,

329
01:18:12,390 --> 01:18:57,880
I am. Take it. Why do I have four of these? What didn't it say? Uh, now I got a clay mass.

330
01:18:57,880 --> 01:19:07,140
I don't wait. So I need to make a bunch of clay. I need clay and water. All right. So I need clay.

331
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:19,420
This is a pain in the ass. Is there salami? Can I make salami water? Worst gamer moment. That no,

332
01:19:19,420 --> 01:19:24,539
it was not. I, that's horse shit. If you say that actual horse shit, don't say that. I,

333
01:19:24,539 --> 01:19:36,979
I tried it like five different ways. Okay. Here we go. What is it? What's the combination?

334
01:19:36,979 --> 01:19:54,199
20 to 50% clay, 20 to 50% water. All right. What's going half and half? Here we go again.

335
01:19:55,210 --> 01:20:14,420
40 and 40. That's perfect. Yeah. That's, that's it. 40, 40 and 40. That's it. It's done. See? See,

336
01:20:14,420 --> 01:20:26,789
a lot of you guys got that wrong, apparently. Yeah. You apparently got that wrong. Okay. I got

337
01:20:26,789 --> 01:20:40,680
clay. Now I need helium. Try to just make more. I'm going to make one more. Probably need it.

338
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:45,159
All right. Now I need to, let's see if I can put this together. I got to put the

339
01:20:45,159 --> 01:20:57,319
in here, right? Um, where's the head? This is a torso, right? Okay. Ballistic torso. Uh, okay.

340
01:20:57,319 --> 01:21:08,579
So, okay. We need ballistic. What else? Ballistic feet? Oh my God. It takes so much of this stupid

341
01:21:08,579 --> 01:21:31,689
ass gel. I need to make more. I need to make way more then. All right. Throw this away.

342
01:21:31,689 --> 01:21:44,039
Gel and water is fine. What was it again? 15 and I need more bottles. Why are you wasting so much

343
01:21:44,039 --> 01:22:01,100
stuff? Um, because it's not real. Oh, balloons. 20 balloons is 630 fucking dollars. And what are

344
01:22:01,100 --> 01:22:31,449
you talking about? Oh, right. Okay. All right. Let's get it. This is 15%. 80%. That should do it

345
01:22:31,449 --> 01:22:55,739
right there. I, what, what happened? What happened? 15 and what's going on? 15, 80%. That's 10, 20,

346
01:22:55,739 --> 01:23:26,460
30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80. Yay. Is that your real, real voice? Yeah. Here we go. Oh, let's do, let's

347
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:33,590
just do, I'm gonna just make a ton of them. This is worse than school. No, it, it isn't. No, it is

348
01:23:33,590 --> 01:23:46,489
not. Oh, also a lot of you would be interested. Um, I have to change my Dark Souls tier list.

349
01:23:46,489 --> 01:23:52,300
I have to change my Dark Souls, you know, what I find to be, what's the best Dark Souls? What's the

350
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:58,140
best Prime software game? I have to change it. I played Dark Souls 3 recently. I was just kind

351
01:23:58,140 --> 01:24:03,960
of messing around on the couch. You're like, oh, why not? I'll play Dark Souls 3 for no reason.

352
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:25,180
I don't like that game. I don't like that game. I don't like it. Demon's Souls is better. God,

353
01:24:25,180 --> 01:24:46,569
I knew it was going to pop and it scared me. The skill issue. No, you know what I figured out about

354
01:24:46,569 --> 01:24:53,720
Dark Souls 3 that I didn't really pay attention to? There, every area has just the annoying group

355
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:58,739
of people that are firing projectiles at you from across the map. Think of all the areas in Dark

356
01:24:58,739 --> 01:25:02,180
Souls 3 and think of how many times you go, wow, this is really fucking annoying. Somebody's just

357
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:19,029
firing missiles at me. What's up with that? What's up with that? Hey, guess what? Bloodborne's a

358
01:25:19,029 --> 01:25:25,989
perfect game. Besides the fact that it's 30 FPS and it's only on PlayStation. Why won't they just,

359
01:25:25,989 --> 01:25:35,770
just release it for the love of God? You know, they could, Sony could probably say,

360
01:25:36,569 --> 01:25:42,569
oh, we're increasing the price of Bloodborne Remastered to a hundred dollars and we'd all

361
01:25:42,569 --> 01:25:50,140
still buy it, right? Like they would, I would buy it. A lot of you would buy it. I mean,

362
01:25:50,140 --> 01:26:13,220
it would be bullshit. It would be absolute horse shit, but we would. Rich Andy. I would hate it.

363
01:26:13,220 --> 01:26:26,300
Whatever. I have enough. I need two of these. It has shit graphics, but that's what I mean,

364
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:36,060
a remaster. It doesn't have shit graphics. It's just older, like almost 10 years old.

365
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:41,930
You're enabling the company to do that in the future. Yeah, that's true. Nevermind.

366
01:26:41,930 --> 01:26:47,720
Bloodborne sucks. It doesn't. I played literally Bloodborne in Dark Souls 3 back to back,

367
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:55,340
just messing around. Polly had never played Bloodborne before. So it was like, holy shit,

368
01:26:55,340 --> 01:26:59,750
this is amazing. All right. When somebody has not played a From Software game and you know they

369
01:26:59,750 --> 01:27:05,189
haven't and they're into the series, that's like bringing, that's like your friend and you go watch

370
01:27:05,189 --> 01:27:08,550
all the Marvel movies back to back and they've never seen it. Or like the Lord of the Rings

371
01:27:08,550 --> 01:27:20,390
movies. It's just, I can't wait to watch you watch Lord of the Rings, right? It's a better game. I

372
01:27:20,390 --> 01:27:35,029
don't need to make three of these. No, Marvel was a bad, okay. Yeah, sure. Marvel was a bad example.

373
01:27:35,029 --> 01:27:39,500
I would have said the same thing about Game of Thrones, but after like season five or six of

374
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:45,060
Game of Thrones, it was kind of just like, ah, no, don't, you don't, don't watch it. I remember

375
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:48,899
people being like, oh man, Game of Thrones, season seven and season eight are coming out.

376
01:27:48,899 --> 01:27:52,260
Should I start? Oh, I should definitely start. Should I watch it? And I'm just like, well,

377
01:27:54,310 --> 01:28:05,750
yeah, yeah. I mean, it's a, it's great. It's a great series. Oh, I can't wait to see what happens.

378
01:28:05,750 --> 01:28:12,979
Yeah, I know. Me too. Me too. And they're like, what are you talking about? Ah, you know,

379
01:28:12,979 --> 01:28:36,789
when was the last time you watched the Varys scene? Oh my God. That's right. It's been a while.

380
01:28:36,789 --> 01:28:59,699
Oh, did I not make any other? What did I, what did I make? How many? I have to make so much of this?

381
01:28:59,699 --> 01:29:14,819
Okay, so I made, I didn't make any arms. This is good enough though, I think. This, I think this

382
01:29:14,819 --> 01:29:30,010
is fine. Do we really need to make it? Oh no, I made the torso. Okay, so I need legs. Where's,

383
01:29:30,010 --> 01:29:44,069
where's that? What is this? I think this is a leg, right? Yeah, I need two of these, but yeah.

384
01:29:44,069 --> 01:29:55,239
Game of Thrones, we'll see. Wait, isn't there, I said Lord of the Rings, isn't it? Doesn't Lord

385
01:29:55,239 --> 01:30:00,279
of the Rings and Game of Thrones both have new shit that's available to watch right now? Is it

386
01:30:00,279 --> 01:30:12,069
worth it? Should I watch it? Is it all right? No, they suck. Do they? I don't know. Do they?

387
01:30:12,069 --> 01:30:26,939
I think I can make four of these. I haven't heard great things about it. I like Rings of Power.

388
01:30:26,939 --> 01:30:38,630
Rings of Power is good? Okay. The Lord of the Rings one is good. They suck. Don't let the fan

389
01:30:38,630 --> 01:30:47,350
boys tell you otherwise. I mean, I don't know. It's so difficult to do that though. I honestly,

390
01:30:47,350 --> 01:30:56,310
at some point it's like, okay, Lord of the Rings was a thing. They made the Hobbit series and people

391
01:30:56,310 --> 01:31:02,600
kind of said, mm, these are all right. It's like after the, these are all right. And it was Peter

392
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:13,100
Jackson that did that. I don't know. I feel like it's hard to make anything else. I don't know.

393
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:19,670
I could be wrong. Is it worse? This guy's got so many. Okay. Hold on. I need one, two, three,

394
01:31:19,670 --> 01:31:34,279
four. I need four more limbs and two hands. This is elaborate. House of the Dragon is the Hobbit

395
01:31:34,279 --> 01:31:42,220
of Game of Thrones. Okay. Okay. I actually didn't really hate the Hobbit movies that much. I thought

396
01:31:42,220 --> 01:31:48,489
they were a little stretched out and a little weird. Some of the CG in the Hobbit movies was

397
01:31:48,489 --> 01:31:55,239
kind of odd. I remember there was one in particular. There was, there was a lot of CG that kind of just

398
01:31:55,239 --> 01:32:01,140
felt strange in those movies. It was like really, yeah, it was weird. I need to make more of that

399
01:32:01,140 --> 01:32:15,079
fluid. House of the Dragon is actually good. This is pretty divided then. I need more pork. Is there

400
01:32:15,079 --> 01:32:22,439
pork in here? Because they filmed it at 48 instead of 24 FPS. Yeah. It's something like that, right?

401
01:32:22,439 --> 01:32:54,520
Give it time. I am absolutely not dogging the show. Settle down. It's fine. Would you sell your soul

402
01:32:54,520 --> 01:33:00,439
for infinite money? No. There's only so much you can buy with money before. It's just like,

403
01:33:00,439 --> 01:33:07,750
what the fuck else do you, what do you do now? You know what I mean? It's like, oh dude, infinite

404
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:14,300
money. Infinite money. All right. So I could get a plane, a boat, and like five houses. Then it's not,

405
01:33:14,300 --> 01:33:22,710
what else? Okay. What else? Dude, you have infinite money. All right. Can I rebuild it? Okay. Can I

406
01:33:22,710 --> 01:33:29,609
rebuild every school in America? Can I spend it on other people? Because that might be worth it.

407
01:33:29,609 --> 01:33:35,609
If I sold my soul for infinite money and I literally fixed every problem in the world,

408
01:33:35,609 --> 01:33:38,409
and then I would just be essentially the one that had to get sacrificed. I mean that,

409
01:33:39,300 --> 01:34:08,119
all right. Do I get to have a cool life for like the next 40 or 50 years? Uh, two more, right? I

410
01:34:08,119 --> 01:34:15,220
mean, if I had infinite money, I would, I don't know, I'd, I'd go all out. I'd go baller mode

411
01:34:15,220 --> 01:34:22,180
on myself, right? For like, okay, for like five years, you would not hear from me at all, ever.

412
01:34:22,180 --> 01:34:26,520
I would just disappear and do a bunch of crazy shit as like a billionaire. And then I would come

413
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:34,819
back. I had fucking bags under my eyes. Be like, all right, it's time to fix this shit. And I would

414
01:34:34,819 --> 01:34:38,020
rebuild every school in America. I'd make, I would plant like fucking hundreds of miles worth of

415
01:34:38,020 --> 01:34:43,609
crops. I would redo our entire education system. I, okay, at that point I'm back and I'm ready to

416
01:34:43,609 --> 01:34:50,060
go. But you, I get, I get a few years where I'm just going to just fuck off and just, I don't know,

417
01:34:50,060 --> 01:34:58,939
live on an island and eat like coconuts and shit. And have like, have like 5G internet on the island.

418
01:34:58,939 --> 01:35:06,329
Just give me, give me like five years for me just to like be a fucking nutcase. And then I'm back

419
01:35:06,810 --> 01:35:14,859
with like a golden suit and a golden top hat and a golden cane. Who am I kidding? I'd be dead.

420
01:35:14,859 --> 01:35:26,710
Are you serious? I would, I'd be dead. Oh dude, what would you do with the, with infinite money?

421
01:35:27,590 --> 01:35:34,060
Well, I would be, I would like bungee jump in a gold suit and way too much and snap the thing and

422
01:35:34,060 --> 01:35:54,949
die. I mean, you know, I'm being honest. We're just getting assassinated. But, but hold on,

423
01:35:54,949 --> 01:36:02,250
but what hap, wait, but what about the money? Is it, okay, we got to clarify a few things here.

424
01:36:02,250 --> 01:36:08,859
Is it a genie scenario where I have to, I have to essentially be alive, right? Like it's me.

425
01:36:08,859 --> 01:36:13,590
And if I'm not around, I can't just like go like this and wave the gold cane around.

426
01:36:13,590 --> 01:36:19,670
So, so it's the devil. Is it the devil? Is it a genie? Is it a, how am I coming? What's my

427
01:36:19,670 --> 01:36:27,380
motivation? Give me some direction here. You get kidnapped. Yeah, but, but that's my point. Like,

428
01:36:27,380 --> 01:36:34,819
but do I, listen, does, do I have to be like, oh, great powerful sorcerer, I would like a hundred

429
01:36:34,819 --> 01:36:51,850
dollars to pay for my bar tab. Like, how does this work? We need some context. It's just a credit

430
01:36:51,850 --> 01:36:57,430
card with no limit and then you don't ever have to pay it back. Okay, but do I have to swipe it or

431
01:36:57,430 --> 01:37:02,949
can somebody take my infinite credit card thing and use it? Because then, yeah, I am making it

432
01:37:02,949 --> 01:37:13,399
24 hours. Okay. Oh, breaking news. It seems that this man, Jeremy Albertson from Las Vegas, Nevada,

433
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:20,729
has in his possession, crazy enough, the infinite money credit card. Anyone who possesses this card

434
01:37:20,729 --> 01:37:26,090
can purchase anything in an infinite amount with no repercussions. I would go to the grocery store

435
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:39,180
and there'd be a million people waiting for me. No, no, I don't want that thing. It's a golden

436
01:37:39,180 --> 01:38:02,789
McDonald's card. No, yeah, no fucking way. No, thanks. But if I really had infinite money, yeah,

437
01:38:03,510 --> 01:38:09,859
I would just disappear. I'd go on a five-year bender and that's not what you guys think it is.

438
01:38:09,859 --> 01:38:18,890
You know what I mean? That's getting wicked high on the couch for like a week or two straight

439
01:38:18,890 --> 01:38:31,220
sometimes watching like tool videos, right? You know what I mean? It's not what you think it is.

440
01:38:31,220 --> 01:38:54,840
Where's the hands? It's clearly exactly what I think it is. No, no, tool, like actual tool videos.

441
01:38:55,770 --> 01:38:58,810
I'm not going to be sitting there just high, just like,

442
01:39:04,409 --> 01:39:10,739
it's being like, I know the piece is bent because I watched it. I'm just sitting there like,

443
01:39:13,850 --> 01:39:21,699
I'm talking, well, I mean, I would probably, I may watch a few of those.

444
01:39:21,699 --> 01:39:47,560
It wouldn't be the only thing I did. It's taking me like 40 minutes to make this.

445
01:39:47,560 --> 01:40:12,250
Okay, now we just have to hammer. Oh, it's a hammer. What? Oh, come on. What about a

446
01:40:12,250 --> 01:40:18,329
McDonald's life pass? What if someone offered you a McDonald's life pass, but to get it one year,

447
01:40:18,329 --> 01:40:26,300
you have to eat McDonald's every day and nothing else. No, why would I do that? That's not,

448
01:40:30,260 --> 01:40:37,560
that's not, that isn't, no thanks. How much is a McDonald's meal?

449
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:43,270
Okay, if I had to eat three meals at McDonald's a day, that would be, what is a, what's like a

450
01:40:43,270 --> 01:40:51,609
number, number one or number two, 10, 15 bucks, like 20 bucks, maybe like $16 maybe

451
01:40:51,609 --> 01:40:57,500
for like two meals or something. All right, so let's just say it's $30 a day. So you're telling

452
01:40:57,500 --> 01:41:05,800
me, so this is effectively what you were saying and this is why it's not worth it. So $30 a day

453
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:17,109
turns into 30 times, uh, seven, right? So that's $210 a week times four. That's $840 a month

454
01:41:17,109 --> 01:41:25,720
times 12. So you are giving me effectively $10,000 to eat McDonald's every single day.

455
01:41:25,720 --> 01:41:32,229
No, that's not even close to being enough money. That's $10,000 for a year's worth of McDonald's.

456
01:41:32,229 --> 01:41:38,250
No, you add two zeros to that. I ain't eating McDonald's every single day for a year for 10

457
01:41:38,250 --> 01:41:44,149
grand worth of McDonald's. No way. Are you kidding me? Make that, make that 10 million,

458
01:41:44,149 --> 01:41:53,979
make that a million, then I'll do it. No, actually I wouldn't. No, I wouldn't. I would not eat

459
01:41:53,979 --> 01:42:01,210
McDonald's every day for a year for a million dollars. You just die. It wasn't, okay, what,

460
01:42:01,210 --> 01:42:06,060
supersize me was like 30 days. Imagine if it supersized me. He was like, yeah, I'm going to

461
01:42:06,060 --> 01:42:10,779
eat McDonald's three meals a day every single day for a year. I think he, I don't know if he,

462
01:42:10,779 --> 01:42:25,460
would he be alive every day? Who is he talking to? You, of course. Who do you think I'm talking to?

463
01:42:26,100 --> 01:42:38,439
And don't get me wrong. McDonald's is one of my favorite places on earth. And I genuinely mean

464
01:42:38,439 --> 01:42:47,130
that. I love that place. I wouldn't want to eat it every single day. I wouldn't want to eat ice cream

465
01:42:47,130 --> 01:43:03,260
every day either. Too much of a good thing kind of sucks. All right, what do I do with this? Would

466
01:43:03,260 --> 01:43:13,210
you eat ice cream every single day for 10 grand? You have to eat it like twice a day. Would you

467
01:43:13,210 --> 01:43:20,579
though? No, you wouldn't. I don't, after like a month or two, you'd be like, I feel sick every day.

468
01:43:20,579 --> 01:43:25,300
And we're talking full fat ice cream. None of this, none of this like oat milk ice cream. None of

469
01:43:25,300 --> 01:43:30,180
this like lactose free ice cream. We're talking ice cream, ice cream, milk, fat, whole milk,

470
01:43:30,180 --> 01:43:47,720
cream, ice cream. You have to eat it three times a day. I didn't already do this. Ballast in the

471
01:43:47,720 --> 01:43:59,779
fountain. What is a ballast? Oh, clay mass and a jerry can. All right, so I need more clay, clay

472
01:43:59,779 --> 01:44:19,380
mass. Wait, is this pork in here? What's going on? Okay, clay and it's just the same thing I was doing

473
01:44:19,380 --> 01:44:30,069
before. If they paid for the ice cream, then yes. I feel like it would be the same thing as McDonald's.

474
01:44:30,069 --> 01:44:41,460
It would be too much. How are you busting myths right now? That's actually a really good question.

475
01:44:46,199 --> 01:44:52,949
Yeah, what myth am I busting? Oh, right. See if you fly away with balloons. That's what it was.

476
01:44:52,949 --> 01:44:59,560
What would your, what would your brand of ice cream be? Wait, if I had ice cream, like an ice cream.

477
01:45:03,140 --> 01:45:18,779
Oh, shit. What would my ice cream flavor be if I would have an ice cream? Shut up. It'd be,

478
01:45:18,779 --> 01:45:26,789
it'd be a chocolate ice cream. And they would be gobs of cookie dough in it. And I'm talking a

479
01:45:26,789 --> 01:45:32,310
smooth chocolate ice cream. Not this like, not like the kind of cocoa dark kind of chocolate. No,

480
01:45:32,310 --> 01:45:39,979
no, no, no, no, no. Smooth milk chocolate ice cream with marshmallow swirls, swirls of like a

481
01:45:39,979 --> 01:46:04,789
marshmallow fluff, like swirls in it. Cookie dough, not chocolate chips. They get, they're annoying.

482
01:46:04,789 --> 01:46:09,699
And like cookie, like cookie crumbles, soft cookie crumbles. Wait, that's cookie dough.

483
01:46:09,699 --> 01:46:14,939
All right. Take out the cookie dough and add like soft cookie, chocolate chip cookie crumbles,

484
01:46:14,939 --> 01:46:46,329
soft, chewy, and graham crackers. And it would be called the fat fuck. $120 for a chair.

485
01:46:47,720 --> 01:46:57,109
Wait, this exists? It's called cookie cobblestone? Oh, no, it already exists.

486
01:46:57,109 --> 01:47:07,239
Cookie cobblestone. What? What this? I need this. Where do I get this? Look at this. This is called

487
01:47:07,239 --> 01:47:34,100
cookie cobblestone. Where is it? Check this out. Okay. Let me see. Chocolate ice cream,

488
01:47:34,100 --> 01:47:38,739
cookie dough, marshmallow swirls, and crushed cookie pieces. What? How come they stole this from me?

489
01:47:38,739 --> 01:47:45,619
This is amazing. I want this right now. This is rocky. You know it's not rocky road. I don't know

490
01:47:45,619 --> 01:47:53,739
what rocky road tastes like. They must've made this like 10 minutes ago. They must've just made

491
01:47:53,739 --> 01:48:05,939
this. Okay. Cookie cobblestone. That's my jam right there. I want this. Is this something like,

492
01:48:05,939 --> 01:48:16,180
it was back in like 2002. It doesn't exist anymore. That looks damn good. Nice job, Eddie's.

493
01:48:16,180 --> 01:48:26,300
Seriously. We connect on stuff, you and I. Eddie's, you and I get it. I mean, some of the world's best

494
01:48:26,300 --> 01:48:33,560
ice cream since, you know, since 1928. I'm just saying. I mean, it's the world's, one of the

495
01:48:33,560 --> 01:48:57,779
world's most tastiest ice creams. Why am I buying bullets? Why am I buying a gun? Stop fighting,

496
01:48:57,779 --> 01:49:05,420
stop fighting your lip. You want that sponsor so bad? Hey, Eddie's, got a couple of streams coming

497
01:49:05,420 --> 01:49:17,300
up. Why would anybody sponsor? Why would an ice cream company sponsor this stream? They would open

498
01:49:17,300 --> 01:49:36,949
up the stream for five minutes and go, nope. Eddie's, I'm available. We're a sponsor. Eddie's

499
01:49:36,949 --> 01:49:48,220
went out of business. No, it didn't. No, it didn't. Eddie's ice cream. What are you talking about?

500
01:49:48,220 --> 01:50:05,260
It exists. No, it's not. They have a tweet from 12 hours ago, guys. They're fine. How dare you

501
01:50:05,260 --> 01:50:11,770
fucking say that? I've actually had them before. I, you know, I love, you know what my favorite,

502
01:50:11,770 --> 01:50:15,210
let's get, you know, ice cream tier list, ice cream from the grocery store tealers.

503
01:50:16,409 --> 01:50:25,659
That word tier. You know who I think makes the best in the grocery store ice cream? What do you

504
01:50:25,659 --> 01:50:43,020
think it is? What do you guys think? You got, you're close. Some of you guys are close. That's right.

505
01:50:43,020 --> 01:50:52,229
Blue Bunny. Blue Bunny makes the best grocery store ice cream without a doubt. It's by a mile.

506
01:50:52,229 --> 01:50:56,149
I mean, it's by, it's by a fucking mile. It's not even, it's, I'm not kidding. It's not even close.

507
01:50:57,510 --> 01:51:04,619
Hold on. Don't even start. Yes, Ben and Jerry's does make the best ice cream,

508
01:51:04,619 --> 01:51:11,479
but Ben and Jerry's does not really have in the grocery store strawberry ice cream or just

509
01:51:11,479 --> 01:51:18,520
chocolate ice cream. It's like Jerry Lewis's tonight dough. It's a bunch of wacky shit and

510
01:51:18,520 --> 01:51:26,569
it's amazing, but I'm talking just straight up chocolate ice cream or strawberry ice cream.

511
01:51:26,569 --> 01:51:32,789
It's, Blue Bunny makes the best. For anything else, it's Ben and Jerry's. So I know I've said

512
01:51:32,789 --> 01:51:38,569
that before. It is the best thing you buy at the grocery store. Hands down. Okay. So I think I'm

513
01:51:38,569 --> 01:51:46,250
ready to do this. I need a potion of helium at the pumping station. This has been a fine chill game.

514
01:51:46,250 --> 01:51:54,260
We're just, we're just hanging out, having a good time. Blue Bunny only makes novelties. No, they

515
01:51:54,260 --> 01:51:59,060
don't. I have, I literally have Blue Bunny chocolate ice cream, just chocolate in my freezer right now

516
01:51:59,060 --> 01:52:07,819
and I eat it all the time. Hillamook is better. Blue Bunny is better. That's my opinion. You have

517
01:52:07,819 --> 01:52:11,020
to, you're making me prove this. Why would I prove that in ice cream? I just go look it up, type

518
01:52:11,100 --> 01:52:23,880
Google Blue Bunny chocolate ice cream. I don't have to prove it to you. You don't have it.

519
01:52:23,880 --> 01:53:23,399
I have it. Okay. I don't know why I have to prove this to everybody. Why does this matter? Why do

520
01:53:23,399 --> 01:53:35,579
you have to know this? Okay. Blue Bunny chocolate, chocolate ice cream. It's just the standard Blue

521
01:53:35,579 --> 01:53:45,180
Bunny chocolate ice cream. It's delicious. It's perfect. It's smooth, pillowy. When you scoop it

522
01:53:45,180 --> 01:54:27,939
out, it makes this like, it's fluffy. It's pillowy. I was anticipating to show you a smooth pillowy.

523
01:54:27,939 --> 01:54:38,229
I just may have been in there for a while. This may, hold on. Was it exploration? Fuck. I fucked

524
01:54:38,229 --> 01:55:16,149
it up. I fucked it up. I fucked it up. I fucked it up. I fucked it up. No, it's not. It's freezer

525
01:55:16,149 --> 01:55:23,220
bird. My freezer is fucked up. That's my fault. That's my fault for showing that to you. That is

526
01:55:23,220 --> 01:55:28,010
not fresh. That I had a freezer problem. That I had to fuck up with my freezer settings. And

527
01:55:28,010 --> 01:55:52,569
that's what did that. My freezer screwed up. So we're good. Too cold. I don't know. I just,

528
01:55:52,569 --> 01:56:00,619
I messed up something with my freezer. That looked like, no, it was free. All right. Anyways,

529
01:56:00,619 --> 01:56:08,699
Blue Bunny is incredibly fluffy. It's smooth. It has an amazing texture. And I know I look really

530
01:56:08,699 --> 01:56:14,979
odd saying that to you right now, but it's true. It's got a pillowy texture. It's, the mouthfeel

531
01:56:14,979 --> 01:56:19,140
is perfect. It like disintegrates in the back of your mouth. And it's just, it's perfect. It's

532
01:56:19,140 --> 01:56:24,340
the best ice cream you can buy. Don't look at what I just showed you. That was, I shouldn't have done

533
01:56:24,340 --> 01:56:31,460
that. I should have showed it to you when it was ready. Play the game. Do you, you don't care about

534
01:56:31,460 --> 01:56:49,100
this game. I know you don't. What am I doing? All right. Water. All right. So now I need helium.

535
01:56:49,100 --> 01:57:07,420
I need, where do I get helium? This looks like helium, right? Where would I get helium? Oh,

536
01:57:07,500 --> 01:57:21,899
here we go. By the way, I want to say this really clearly too. Strawberry ice cream.

537
01:57:24,340 --> 01:57:29,260
I like it when there's some strawberries in it. My favorite kind of strawberry ice cream is

538
01:57:29,260 --> 01:57:42,170
no chunks, just smooth strawberry flavor. How do I make this? Just 90 to 100% helium. That's it.

539
01:57:42,170 --> 01:58:06,630
Okay. You know, plastic bottle. I need 10 of these. What? Why do I need so much shit? Oh,

540
01:58:06,630 --> 01:58:25,909
it's three for each one. I get it. All right. It's time to start the experiment. Now I need a chair.

541
01:58:25,909 --> 01:58:40,760
Page 11. Oh my God. Okay. Get the right pieces for the chair frame. Yeah, I'm done after this.

542
01:58:40,760 --> 01:58:46,460
We're going to change games. This is cool. This is fine. But I, we gotta change this.

543
01:58:46,460 --> 01:58:54,340
We're on experiment two. Yeah, but we've paused and had like a stupid shitty podcast

544
01:58:54,340 --> 01:58:59,720
for at least like 40 minutes of this stream. All right. So I need to do rectangular steel.

545
01:58:59,720 --> 01:59:11,369
Okay. Wooden beam and wooden cylinder. Wooden beam and wooden cylinder. I gotta change the saw too.

546
01:59:11,369 --> 01:59:21,060
Really? I would love a German podcast. Um, I, I wouldn't. I wouldn't. This is, we already do it.

547
01:59:21,060 --> 01:59:26,119
I'm doing it right now. We just do it. This is what we do. Half the streams are just that.

548
01:59:26,119 --> 01:59:29,720
They, you know, I don't know. Why would I do a podcast? Like we're just already doing it.

549
01:59:29,720 --> 01:59:39,380
I don't, I would, going on someone's podcast is fine. I think that's fun, but I feel like I

550
01:59:39,380 --> 01:59:54,619
wouldn't be able to do very much on my podcast. God damn it. This better be worth it. Can I cut?

551
01:59:54,619 --> 02:00:04,630
Wait, can I? Oh, it's the wrong one. How a metal cutting saw can cut a wooden

552
02:00:04,630 --> 02:00:19,369
piece of furniture. Okay. I'm sorry. Take it out. How do I unscrew this wrench?

553
02:00:19,369 --> 02:00:37,449
How do I get rid of this? Oh, this, there we go. Would you play heroes three? Like heroes might

554
02:00:37,449 --> 02:00:48,710
magic three. I want, wait, back it up. I want to, I want to, what is this? This is a wooden saw.

555
02:00:48,710 --> 02:01:06,420
Okay. I need to buy it. Um, I wouldn't, if people wanted to see it, I'd probably play it again.

556
02:01:06,420 --> 02:01:20,949
It was fun. You'd have to want it, right? You have to want to see it. What about Subnautica?

557
02:01:20,949 --> 02:01:29,380
I, didn't I play Subnautica? I did. Didn't I? I played so many games. I feel like I have played

558
02:01:29,380 --> 02:01:58,979
it on stream. Haven't I? Play it again. Damn. Okay. That was almost like quadruple. All right,

559
02:01:58,979 --> 02:02:05,060
we're good. All right. Get the right pieces in the chair frame. I think I got it. Right. I did it.

560
02:02:05,060 --> 02:02:28,069
I did. Head to the rocket launch site. Let's go. I got to turn the music on. All right. Take Buster

561
02:02:28,069 --> 02:03:04,600
to the safe zone. Let's go. Where should I play after this? How come this one's the radio? The

562
02:03:04,600 --> 02:03:48,949
other one wasn't the radio. There you go. Okay. Assemble the chair. Roblox? Oh no. Mount the chair

563
02:03:48,949 --> 02:04:06,939
and wait, what are you talking about? What's wrong with this? Ah, install six balloons. Well,

564
02:04:06,939 --> 02:04:45,479
don't go, don't leave yet. Okay. I don't, where is it? I don't have a button anymore. Where's the,

565
02:04:45,479 --> 02:05:20,260
where's my button? Where's the truck? It's in my fucking pocket. God damn it. See, in that scenario,

566
02:05:20,260 --> 02:05:27,829
I do not tell anybody that. In that scenario, I drive all the way there. I walk into the warehouse.

567
02:05:27,829 --> 02:05:35,020
I put my hand in my pocket and I go, oh my God, it's in my pocket. And then I text whoever is on,

568
02:05:35,020 --> 02:05:40,920
out in the, in the field. And I go, oh yeah, man, still looking for it. Did you, did you touch it?

569
02:05:40,920 --> 02:05:45,159
You might, I think I saw you have it for like 10 minutes. And then they go, yeah, dude, I had it

570
02:05:45,159 --> 02:05:51,500
for 10 minutes. Oh fuck. I'm still looking for it, man. I'll find it. And then I text the person

571
02:05:51,500 --> 02:05:58,920
again in five minutes, selfie under a desk and with a thumbs up, like, got it. Like this is where

572
02:05:58,920 --> 02:06:06,180
it was. I found it. And everyone's like, yeah. Oh, thank God, Jeremy, you saved the day. You saved,

573
02:06:06,180 --> 02:06:24,250
you saved the experiment. Let's go. What land on the island? While I'm trying to get points,

574
02:06:24,250 --> 02:07:17,590
who is that? Why am I doing this? How do I slow down? We're going way too fast. I don't have a

575
02:07:17,590 --> 02:07:42,460
gun. Wait, what happened? Why? All right, hold on. Unlock the chair. A-W-A-S-D. How am I supposed to

576
02:07:42,460 --> 02:08:03,449
fly up there? Um, that doesn't make any sense. How am I, how do I do that? Shit. Do it again.

577
02:08:03,449 --> 02:09:16,949
I can't shoot the- I don't, whatever. Throw it away. Wait, I didn't do it. Yeah, I did. It's fine.

578
02:09:16,949 --> 02:09:24,500
That was fun. What are we doing next? What should we do now? What do you think? How you guys feel?

579
02:09:24,500 --> 02:09:31,909
What should we play? I got a few things. Let's do, we can do 20 minutes till dawn. That game was a ton

580
02:09:31,909 --> 02:09:41,500
of fun. Play Driver. How am I going to, where's, how am I going to get access to Driver? Is Driver

581
02:09:41,500 --> 02:09:56,119
on Steam? I'll give you some options. You want to do a vote? Yeah, we'll, we'll throw some options

582
02:09:56,119 --> 02:10:08,760
in there. Okay, let's see. We could do, uh, let's see here. Let me move this. All right, we could do,

583
02:10:08,760 --> 02:10:21,180
what should I put on the poll? I could put on, call the lamb. Put on, uh, 20 minutes till dawn.

584
02:10:21,180 --> 02:10:35,060
Put on, what was the other thing you just said? You just said one. What was it? Ultrakill. I feel

585
02:10:35,060 --> 02:10:40,149
like my, I don't think my brain can handle Ultrakill. I need to really be into it. Driver's not on

586
02:10:40,149 --> 02:10:59,670
Steam. Where am I going to get access to Driver? Is Driver on Steam? No, it's not. What was the

587
02:10:59,670 --> 02:11:06,649
thing you just said? Somebody just said something cool. You said, somebody said something cool.

588
02:11:06,649 --> 02:11:14,220
What was it? All right, let me get the poll going. All right, so we could do, no, not, uh, Gloomwood.

589
02:11:14,220 --> 02:11:37,210
I'll do Gloomwood on its own stream. Okay, uh, Cult of the Lamb. 20 minutes till dawn. Yeah,

590
02:11:37,210 --> 02:11:47,079
I can't see. Yeah, we gotta have a third game. No, Sorcerer will be its own day. What else,

591
02:11:47,079 --> 02:11:50,779
what else can I do? There was something else I wanted to play and I don't remember what it was.

592
02:11:50,779 --> 02:12:06,890
Somebody said something cool and I forget what the hell it was. Superliminal. All right, or

593
02:12:07,850 --> 02:12:15,750
what do you think? Oh, it's already active. Wait, wait, what? Oh, the poll, no, no, no,

594
02:12:15,750 --> 02:12:23,819
the third game is Superliminal. We gotta, we gotta do it with Superliminal on there.

595
02:12:23,819 --> 02:12:41,369
Superliminal sounds interesting. Uh, stream's gonna be, uh, it's gonna F for a minute while I

596
02:12:41,369 --> 02:13:06,869
download it. Yeah, kill the poll. We gotta put Superliminal on there. Play Pepsi Man? I would.

597
02:13:06,869 --> 02:13:14,710
Superliminal is awesome. All right, well, let's do it. Try to do it and forget about the rest of

598
02:13:14,710 --> 02:13:18,310
the poll. Let's just do it. I'm gonna play Superliminal. Whatever. Things like people

599
02:13:18,310 --> 02:13:29,899
are into that. Yeah, I'll play it. No, I'm not gonna play Disco Elcium. That game's like 150

600
02:13:29,899 --> 02:13:41,880
hours long. I'll get 10 minutes into it and be like, oh, I'll play it off stream, guys.

601
02:13:41,880 --> 02:13:46,039
All right, Superliminal is downloading. Do I, let me refill my drink. I'll be right back

602
02:13:46,039 --> 02:13:56,970
while it downloads. Superliminal is what we're playing. Get out of, Jesus Christ.

603
02:14:01,189 --> 02:14:02,630
All right, give me one second. I'll be right back.
