1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:16,359
Hello! Hi! What up? How's everybody doing? Give back the lipstick. Oh, well, it's right here.

2
00:00:17,899 --> 00:00:26,789
It'll be returned in a timely prompt manner when I'm finished with it. That makes it sound like I'm

3
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:38,939
wearing it now, but I'm not. But welcome back, huh? Another day. Today, we're gonna do something called

4
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:47,820
A.I. Dungeon 2. I currently am. There was a lot of debate on how to get this to actually run.

5
00:00:48,939 --> 00:00:53,340
It was, oh, just use the website. Oh, don't use the website. Maybe do this, run it locally. I found

6
00:00:54,539 --> 00:01:04,140
the best way. Live from Las Vegas, Nevada. It's the Jerma Show. No, there wasn't. Yes, there was.

7
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:13,099
There was like, there was like two people that were in a huge fight. They were saying, guys,

8
00:01:13,099 --> 00:01:17,099
just let him run the beta client. And then like somebody popped in and was like, dude,

9
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:22,939
he needs to run the collab client. And I don't, I don't, I'm not sure if those people are still here,

10
00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:34,579
but they were screaming. That was me. No, I gotta run him. It's ready to go. I actually have a game

11
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:43,400
going right now. I have been told a few things about this. This apparently is not the most stable

12
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:51,560
program on earth because it's a very, it's in beta. It's running through a client. It's running

13
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:58,500
through another client. So this is, there's, this is probably going to crash a few times,

14
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:04,310
but I should be able to come right back. Oh, I got like something, what's on my throat today?

15
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,689
I've messed with it for a while. It crashes a lot. Yeah. So expect it to be

16
00:02:12,969 --> 00:02:18,330
not perfect, but we're going to get what we can out of it. If you don't know what A.I. Dungeon is,

17
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:24,650
uh, it is essentially Talk to Transformer, but what I've been told much more elaborate

18
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:31,129
and focused than that. You roll a dungeon and you have to play through the dungeon.

19
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:41,539
It being not that stable is an understatement. It's incredibly unstable. What's going on? Like

20
00:02:41,539 --> 00:02:50,699
what happened here? Did I drink eggs? What's wrong with my voice? I feel like I swallowed

21
00:02:50,699 --> 00:03:02,120
two or three raw eggs. Hold on. Whatever. It's going to be fine. I'm going to be doing like

22
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:08,169
voices anyways. So, uh, let's do the first one. Let's get started. It's already ready to go.

23
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:15,659
Here it is. So we get, I didn't do a random story. I figured we would do,

24
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:27,689
start off easy, right? Here comes the porn. Uh, would mean porn. Uh, I'm going to give this,

25
00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:32,009
hold on just a second. This is a porn game. It's not a porn game.

26
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:40,460
Anyways, we're going to do fantasy because that's the one that's recommended is fantasy, mystery,

27
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:49,719
apocalyptic zombies, or a custom story. It's not porn game. It's, I'm going to avoid all the pornographic

28
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:55,240
scenarios. Okay. Let's do fantasy. We're going to start with fantasy. That's the easy one.

29
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:04,919
Pick a character in fantasy, a noble, a knight, a wizard, a peasant, or a rogue. I'm going to be a

30
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:13,990
noble. I want to be a noble. I think that would be, that is a good start. Noble. What is your name?

31
00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:40,360
What is my name? Well, they call me many things in this town. Sire, Lord, Larry, Lord Larry,

32
00:04:40,360 --> 00:05:01,259
Lord, Lord Leonard, Lord. I'm a noble. I'm Larry. Lord, Lord, Lord Lance. No, Lord

33
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:12,790
Leo, Lord Leo. Oh, uh, what is your, oh, these are instructions. Okay. All right. Right. Right.

34
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:20,899
Right. So now I got these things. What I'm going to do now is I'm okay. I'm going to zoom in a

35
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:41,209
little bit here so we can do this together. Cause I don't want, I don't want to be any spoilers.

36
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:52,569
Okay. Here we go. You are Lord Leo, a noble from the land of Brothian. You have a pendant

37
00:05:52,569 --> 00:06:00,279
and a house seal. One morning you are awakened by one of your laborers. She tells you that your

38
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:05,300
state is being surrounded. You look out the window and see a group of men dressed in black,

39
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:09,540
standing on top of the hill. They are armed with crossbows and wearing leather armor.

40
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:14,019
The woman who woke you also says they are very well dressed.

41
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:32,339
Well, this music doesn't make any sense now. All right, here we go. This really this quickly.

42
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:55,699
What do you do? Uh, okay. I closed the blinds. The man who wakes you looks at you and then turns

43
00:06:55,699 --> 00:07:01,060
his attention to the window. He closes it, but not before you can see him turn around and say,

44
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:05,939
I'm sorry about this. He walks over to you and puts his hand on your shoulder.

45
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:20,899
I'm sorry about this. We must protect this house.

46
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:37,220
Lord Leo, I will protect my home. He says, yes, yes, I know you, you reply, but we need to get

47
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:41,699
inside. He nods and begins walking towards the door.

48
00:07:45,670 --> 00:08:00,649
No, not your house, my house. He begins walking towards the door. I reply,

49
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:22,790
no, I mean my house must be protected, right? Like, well, what's that's what gods do, you know?

50
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:37,029
All right, hold on. Look outside. Are they still there? You watch as the man continues to walk

51
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:42,710
towards the door. Suddenly, he stops and turns around. He points to the house and speaks in an

52
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:47,990
odd language. It sounds like some sort of ancient tongue, but you don't understand a word. The man

53
00:08:47,990 --> 00:09:01,740
starts walking back towards the house. Wait, is he signaling to people? All right, that sounds like

54
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:16,179
some sort of ancient tongue. Close and lock the door before he gets in. He's part of the resistance.

55
00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:21,899
You close the door and lock it with a key. Then you stand up and start pacing around the room.

56
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:38,220
Finally, you sit down on the bed and begin thinking. Call mom. She'll know what to do.

57
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:47,429
You call out to your mother, but she doesn't answer. She must be busy. You think about calling

58
00:09:47,429 --> 00:09:58,490
her again. When you're alone, you continue to wait for her to return. Okay, I gotta arm myself

59
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:12,710
a sword. You grab a sword off the table and put it into its scabbard. You also grab a dagger from

60
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:17,350
the draw and put it into its scabbard. You take a small leather pouch from your pocket and put some

61
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:31,399
coins in it. You open the door and enter the room. Leave the house. You exit the house and

62
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:36,440
head back to the inn. When you arrive, you find that the innkeeper has already left.

63
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:47,700
You wonder if you should follow him or go back to the house. Follow the innkeeper.

64
00:10:54,659 --> 00:11:01,480
You follow the innkeeper back to the house. Wait, he's going back to my house? Eventually,

65
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:06,600
you reach it. You knock on the door, but no one answers. You try the front door, but there is

66
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:15,320
nobody there either. You decide to check the back door, but it is locked too. Did I lock myself out

67
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:30,460
of my house? I think I locked myself out of my house. Okay, break in the house. You rush through

68
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:35,019
the back door and run straight to the bedroom. You quickly grab a nearby knife and stab the wall

69
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:40,059
several times until you hear something fall on the floor. You peek through the peephole and see a

70
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:54,389
woman dressed in black standing behind you. What? How do you look through a peephole and see somebody

71
00:11:54,389 --> 00:12:02,950
behind you? That doesn't make any sense. Oh, from dressed in black. It's the people that were coming

72
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:21,899
to get me. Turn around, ask the woman why she is here. She smiles and tells you,

73
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:44,539
my name is Lilith and I'm here to help you. How are you going to help me? She replies,

74
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:57,669
by helping me kill you. Oh, that's a pretty good, that's a pretty good one-liner.

75
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:15,210
By helping me kill you. Don't kill me. I can pay. See, like, whatever it is, I'll double.

76
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:23,929
Don't kill me. I can pay. She laughs and says, no, you won't, but you might still be able to save

77
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:47,139
your own life. I won't pay. Run out of the house. You run out of the house and down the stairs.

78
00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:56,470
You don't stop running until you are far away from the area. This is Minecraft? Call mom.

79
00:13:57,659 --> 00:14:02,220
You call out to your mother, but she does not answer. You think about calling for her again

80
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:14,379
later when you're alone. You continue to wait for her to return. Wait for mom to return. You wait

81
00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:21,179
patiently for mom to come back. Eventually, she returns. She seems upset. You think about how she

82
00:14:21,179 --> 00:14:29,399
would feel if you had killed her son. You hope she doesn't hate you for it. Is that about me?

83
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:51,110
She's talking about me. Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Do I have a brother? Greet her with open

84
00:14:51,110 --> 00:15:03,509
arms. You greet her warmly. Mom smiles and hugs you tightly. You tell her everything. Mom tells

85
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:09,590
you that she is glad you came back because she was worried about you. She asks you if you would want

86
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:25,779
to stay with her tonight. You say yes and she kisses you goodbye. Okay, dig down five blocks.

87
00:15:32,259 --> 00:15:38,039
You dig down five blocks and find a house. Inside the house, you find a young girl. She looks very

88
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:42,519
frightened and confused. You tell her that you are her father and uncle and that you've been looking

89
00:15:42,519 --> 00:16:01,700
for her all day. What? Keep digging down and keep digging down until you find, keep digging down

90
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:14,019
until you find obsidian. You keep digging down and eventually you find a large stone block.

91
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:19,379
You pick it up and place it on the ground. You then shout, this is where you were buried.

92
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:40,379
The girl runs forward and grabs the stone. She stares at it in awe. Ask for the stone. You ask

93
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:45,190
the girl, where did you bury the other boy? She looks at you and says his body fell down into the

94
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:49,269
river and washed up here. His name is Harry and he drowned in the river last year.

95
00:16:49,669 --> 00:17:14,069
Run full speed into cave wall. You sprint into the cave and jump onto the rock face. You throw

96
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:20,890
yourself at the cave wall and slam your fist against it. You scream in pain and cry out, oh god,

97
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:42,650
oh god, oh god, oh god. Go to the doctor. Go to the doctor. You run back to the house and tell mom

98
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:56,740
what happened. She takes you to the doctor who examines you. The doctor says we are going to

99
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:10,859
have to remove the hand and he pulls out a finger and then pulls out another finger and another.

100
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:32,440
Finally, he removes your entire hand. This is, that's fucked up. Uh, ask for him to do the

101
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:44,420
left hand. Ask for him to do the other hand. The doctor comes over and examines your hands. He

102
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:48,980
tells you that you will need two more fingers removed. He puts his hand on your right hand

103
00:18:48,980 --> 00:19:01,430
and begins to pull out your fingers. You scream in agony and beg him to stop. Finally, he finishes

104
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:13,539
removing them. The doctor says I am going to have to remove all your toes too.

105
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:31,400
He removes your feet as well. You scream in horror and yell at him to stop.

106
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:58,890
Finally, he stops and looks at you. I'm sorry. I have the wrong chart. Uh oh, it's thinking.

107
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:25,769
It's thinking. It's thinking. It's really thinking. Uh oh. I'm sorry. I have another patient

108
00:20:25,769 --> 00:20:50,539
chart. Am I dead? I'm sorry. Rewind. Revert's the last action. Okay, it's the last revert.

109
00:20:50,539 --> 00:21:13,819
You have to reload the cell. Shit. Damn it. New story. I died. I'm dead. Uh, he removed my hands

110
00:21:13,819 --> 00:21:19,819
and feet with no, um, no, no, no volcano anesthesia and I just died. And he told me,

111
00:21:19,819 --> 00:21:25,500
I'm sorry. I have the wrong chart. That's it. That's where I'm dead. All right. I gotta reload

112
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:40,309
the cell. Fatal error. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

113
00:21:40,309 --> 00:21:48,390
I think, okay, no, hold on. Yeah, it's fucked up. Oh, I can load the game. I can load this game.

114
00:21:48,390 --> 00:22:03,190
Wait, wait, wait. I can use the same ID. Can I? No, let me try to load this. Yeah, it's the load.

115
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:10,920
It might crash it. Oh, so don't, don't, do not load games. Try not using dialogue in the game.

116
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:16,970
Type stuff like, you tell your mother to take you to the doctor. Should I not use quotes? Like,

117
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:22,410
should I? Don't put thing in quotes. Just say, like, the doctor says this. The doctor says you

118
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:34,380
have, so, so use quotes. Okay. All right. It's booting back up. Why didn't I read the instructions?

119
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:42,009
I, I did. Quotes are fine, but start with this person says, okay. I've read the instruction.

120
00:22:42,650 --> 00:23:08,230
When you want other people to talk, do not use quotes. Okay. It's coming back. Don't use the

121
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:19,529
word ask. It breaks a lot of these. Okay. Do whatever. The AI will figure it out.

122
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:36,069
All right. It's coming. It's coming. It's loading. This may take a few minutes.

123
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:49,779
Well, we knew this was going to happen. Can you guys even see it? Ask it for now, but let's

124
00:23:49,779 --> 00:23:57,099
start a new one. Let's start a new one. I guess the first time I did it. All right. It should

125
00:23:57,099 --> 00:24:08,099
start in a second here. This is funny though. Make my own Nancy Drew story. All right. That

126
00:24:08,099 --> 00:24:20,869
sounds good. I'm going to do mystery and I'm going to, I'm going to be Nancy Drew. Do a completely

127
00:24:20,869 --> 00:24:42,170
random one. We will. I want to do a Drew crew first. I need some mystery music. One in the chat

128
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:58,599
for the Drew crew. Yeah. All right. Here we go. Mystery. I need like a good one. Okay. New game,

129
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:14,950
zero random story. No mystery. Let's do mystery. Pick a character detective. I want to be a

130
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:29,829
detective. What is your name? My name is Nancy Drew. Yeah. Interaction starting with a verb.

131
00:25:30,789 --> 00:25:36,789
Go to the tavern or attack the orc to speak. Enter, say the thing you want to say or just

132
00:25:36,789 --> 00:25:39,910
the thing you want to say, right? Yeah, that's correct. All right. Here we go.

133
00:25:42,089 --> 00:25:49,460
No, it's going to be Nancy Drew soundtrack. Nancy Drew music. I mean, it has to be like a

134
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:57,259
relaxing and peaceful Nancy Drew music. You guys didn't think you were going to get it two

135
00:25:57,259 --> 00:26:10,099
times in a row. I picked a spy. Oh shit. Whatever. You are Nancy Drew, a spy living in Chicago.

136
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:16,339
You have a concealed pistol and a syringe of poison. You listen to the Russian diplomats

137
00:26:16,339 --> 00:26:22,019
and hear them discussing how they can get rid of you. If we could kill you with a car bomb,

138
00:26:22,019 --> 00:26:34,059
one says, oh, we could blow up your hotel room. Where are we? Where are we?

139
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:55,480
Oh, that was a great Russian accent. I look around the room. You turn on the light switch

140
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:59,160
and see that there is no way anyone would be able to enter the room without being seen.

141
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:18,630
The door is locked from the inside. Okay. Call mom. You call your mom's cell phone number and

142
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:23,430
wait for her to pick up. When she does, you tell her what happened. She tells you to go back to

143
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:32,700
sleep. The next day you call again. This time you speak more clearly. Say, I am in trouble.

144
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:49,140
Right? That's what they want you to do. Like say, and then quotes, right? I am in trouble.

145
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:55,180
Mom, mom hangs up on you. You feel like crying. It isn't fair. Why can't you just understand?

146
00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:10,789
Remove pistol and aim at what was, would they have names? Remove pistol? No, no, no.

147
00:28:10,869 --> 00:28:18,470
Remove pistol from shirt. Remove pistol from shirt. Where is it hidden? Remove pistol from shirt.

148
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:28,329
You take off your shirt and put it over your head. Then you place the gun

149
00:28:28,329 --> 00:28:37,720
under your pillow. A few hours later, you hear a knock at the door. You open it. A man with a

150
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:52,710
bushy mustache stands before you. He looks like he has been drinking. Say, please come in. Please

151
00:28:52,710 --> 00:29:17,380
come in. He didn't say anything. You keep breaking it by doing quotes? I, doesn't it say up here?

152
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:34,220
Say the thing you want to say with quotes. Wait, he said, please come in. Tell him to come in.

153
00:29:38,809 --> 00:30:10,619
Come in. So come in. If I, is it a mirror? I close the door or she, she closes the door, right?

154
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:38,839
Shoot. Mirror. I think it's fucked. It shattered beautifully. Just wait. Oh, I think it might be

155
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:51,450
dead again. The game tell, hold on. What? The game tells you quotes are okay, but they are not. They

156
00:30:51,450 --> 00:31:03,779
make the AI much more prone to crashing. Just don't ever use quotes ever again. True. Correct. Yes.

157
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:14,950
So I'm just not going to use quotes anymore. I'm just going to just tell the game what

158
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:27,690
people already said. Okay. Should we wait this out? Don't use them. I just won't use them at all.

159
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:53,750
It's broken. Fuck. Use parentheses? Let's try it again. Redo it. No, don't use parentheses.

160
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:58,299
Don't use brackets. I'm just not going to use quotes anymore. If you use quotes and it really,

161
00:31:58,859 --> 00:32:09,900
it's prone to just dumping out, then I don't even want to use them. Start with a verb every time.

162
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:23,420
Okay. Pick detective this time. Make a custom story. Well, I want to get one to work to completion

163
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:41,480
first. Instead of getting my hands and feet cut off and then the thing crashing. The AI says you

164
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:51,799
can use words, but it actually makes it more prone to crashing. Just use emojis. You can say things

165
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:59,140
like say, and then the, yeah, that's what I was doing. I was doing say space quotation something,

166
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:08,869
quotation, end. It screwed it up. Dermawalk, the crew wants more Drew. Not going to happen.

167
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:37,140
Not right now. All right. We're almost ready. Set the next story in Super Frogland. I'm out.

168
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:49,859
Drew crew. The original, I'm using the collab one. That's the one I'm using right now. That is the

169
00:33:49,859 --> 00:34:10,420
current one I'm using. All right. Let's go. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

170
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:16,730
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

171
00:34:17,449 --> 00:34:32,679
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

172
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:39,349
Let's go. Let's go. Yeah. All right. We're going to get it. Third time's the charm. No more quotes.

173
00:34:40,150 --> 00:35:11,429
New game. Not a random story. Mystery. Detective. Drew. Let's go. Here it comes. The first one we

174
00:35:11,429 --> 00:35:24,780
got at least far enough where I died. Here we go. You are Drew, the detective living in Chicago.

175
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:29,739
You have a pistol and a police badge. You enter the forest where you believe the criminal you're

176
00:35:29,739 --> 00:35:43,019
searching for fled to. Suddenly, you hear a gunshot behind you. Look behind. Look behind you or look

177
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:55,260
behind me. Am I dead? Did I just get shot from behind? Look behind me. What is it? You turn

178
00:35:55,260 --> 00:36:10,170
around and see that you've shot yourself in the head. What the fuck are you talking about?

179
00:36:10,969 --> 00:36:43,590
Am I still alive? Am I dead? No, you're alive. The bullet was lodged in your brain,

180
00:36:43,590 --> 00:37:02,139
but it didn't kill you yet. You can still move your body. Go to the hospital. You run back

181
00:37:02,869 --> 00:37:09,269
and find out that you're not dead yet. A doctor comes and examines you. He says he's going to

182
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:28,340
have to operate on you right away. He says you might never walk again. The doctor removes

183
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:52,300
both feet. It's the same doctor. Is it going to break it? The doctor. Do the operation. Okay.

184
00:37:53,500 --> 00:38:03,900
Do the operation. Nice detective story. Do the operation. This won't break it.

185
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:16,500
The doctor isn't a verb. Okay. Do the operation. See what happens. You agree to do the surgery

186
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:23,219
immediately. You feel so much better after the operation. Your body is stronger than ever before.

187
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:37,820
You even managed to get a job as a detective again. A year passes. Go to the forest. That's

188
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:50,300
where I was supposed to go. Go to the forest. I was trying to find a criminal. You decide to

189
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:54,539
go to the forest where you first met your mother. She told you about how she used to hide from the

190
00:38:54,539 --> 00:38:59,820
monsters there. You wonder if you should try to find her again or just forget all about it.

191
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:20,869
Hide from the monsters. Is that going to break it? Call mom. Yeah, that's a good idea. Call mom.

192
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:32,150
You call your mother's number one more time. It rings, but no answer. You wait for a while,

193
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:36,150
then finally give up. You realize that you won't be able to talk to your mother anymore anyway.

194
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:47,739
You don't know what will become of you now. Track criminal. Track a criminal.

195
00:39:49,079 --> 00:40:11,110
Track a criminal. Call dad. Track a criminal. You decide to search for the criminal who killed

196
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:16,389
your mother. You follow his trail and eventually catch him. He tells you that he knows who you

197
00:40:16,389 --> 00:40:31,610
are because he saw you in the newspaper. That's why she wouldn't answer the phone. Torture? Oh,

198
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:54,010
electrocute. What the fuck? Electrocute the criminal. With how? The criminal doesn't

199
00:40:54,010 --> 00:41:01,530
seem surprised by this suggestion. He electrocutes you instead. You scream in pain and fall unconscious.

200
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:32,730
You wake up in a strange room with a man holding a gun to your head. Does that work? Is that going

201
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:45,300
to break it? You say that he should shoot himself. Don't type you. Say, so say you say,

202
00:41:46,260 --> 00:42:13,579
say he should shoot himself. Tell, say in quotes, shoot yourself. Tell him to shoot himself.

203
00:42:14,539 --> 00:42:22,280
No quotes. Tell him to shoot himself. That's more right. Tell him to shoot himself.

204
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:37,369
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay. You refuse to tell the man to shoot himself. Instead, you say,

205
00:42:37,369 --> 00:43:05,449
I'm sorry and thank you. The man shoots himself. You're free now. It worked. Leave, leave the room.

206
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:24,489
Leave, just how about leave area, leave room. Take, take his wallet. Take his wallet. You take

207
00:43:24,489 --> 00:43:32,570
the man's wallet. Inside is some money and a photograph of your mother. You remember that

208
00:43:32,570 --> 00:44:09,099
you'll need those things later. Shoot the photograph. You shoot the photograph at the wall.

209
00:44:09,099 --> 00:44:14,139
You hear a loud noise and the picture falls off the wall. You look down and see that you're wearing

210
00:44:14,139 --> 00:44:39,030
a blue suit. You also notice that you're no longer bald. You're a blue. No, I'm a detective. Go.

211
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:46,949
All right. That case is closed. Go to the police station. Right. Let's, let's go get some,

212
00:44:47,030 --> 00:45:08,099
I've got to get a new case. Or go to my office. Go to my office. Go to my office. You go to your

213
00:45:08,099 --> 00:45:13,059
office. There's a door there which you open. In front of you is a desk covered with papers.

214
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:18,820
On top of the desk sits a woman dressed in black. She looks at you and smiles. She calls you by

215
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:34,869
name and introduces herself as Dawn. Dawn. Tell her to get off the desk. Get off the desk.

216
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:49,420
Like get off my desk. You tell Dawn to get off the desk. She does so, but then asks why you're here.

217
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:55,960
You explain to her that you want to thank her for saving your life when you were little. She

218
00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:42,550
says that she understands completely. I'm in my office. Okay. So, uh, call Dawn's mom. You call

219
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:51,500
Dawn's mom's phone. Dawn answers. You ask her if she remembers you. She says yes, but she's not

220
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:56,460
sure why you'd want to thank her. You explain that you're glad you found her. Dawn says that she's

221
00:46:56,460 --> 00:47:19,260
happy too. So, all right. Go to McDonald's. Does that exist in this universe? Go to McDonald's.

222
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:38,019
Or no, let's go to Burger King. I mean, I've had a long day. Go to Burger King. You go to Burger

223
00:47:38,019 --> 00:47:44,980
King. You order a burger and fries. They come out quickly. You eat them happily. You return to your

224
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:50,179
office. Dawn comes in and asks if everything went well. You tell her that it did. Dawn thanks you

225
00:47:50,179 --> 00:47:55,349
and leaves. You think about what happened today. That's it. I just went, I just enjoyed Burger King

226
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:59,110
and came back to the office. Mission accomplished.

227
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:00,309
She did.

228
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:17,420
Arrest Dawn. You call Dawn's cell phone and see that she called Dawn's mom. You call Dawn's mom's

229
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:22,619
phone and see what that she answered. You tell Dawn that she needs to come over right away.

230
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:30,969
Dawn arrives at the house. You tell Dawn that you're arresting her. You call Dawn's cell phone and

231
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:38,980
see that she called Dawn's mom. You call Dawn's mom's phone and see that she answered. You tell

232
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:44,760
Dawn that she needs to come over right away. You tell her that you're arresting her. This is an

233
00:48:44,760 --> 00:49:14,869
SAT question. Yeah, this is. Complete the SAT question. You complete the SAT question.

234
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:21,820
What is the first letter of each word in the following sentence? My daughter is having trouble

235
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:29,139
sleeping. Answer A. You finish the question and hand it to Dawn. She reads it. What is she gonna

236
00:49:29,139 --> 00:49:42,699
teach her? She reads it out loud. You ask Dawn if you got a good grade. You ask Dawn, you ask Dawn

237
00:49:42,699 --> 00:50:06,619
if you got a good grade. Ask Dawn if you got a good grade. Okay, that works right? You ask Dawn

238
00:50:06,619 --> 00:50:13,340
if she got a good grade. She says yes. You ask her if she wants to go to prom with you. She says

239
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:29,369
yes. You say congratulations and hang up. You're very proud of her. Go to prom with Dawn. You go

240
00:50:29,369 --> 00:50:34,730
to prom with Dawn. You both dance together. You both kiss each other. You both cry. You both go

241
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:52,820
back to your apartment. You celebrate your newfound happiness. You're under arrest. You call Dawn's

242
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:58,579
cell phone. Dawn answers. You ask her if she remembers you. She says yes, but she's not sure

243
00:50:58,579 --> 00:51:02,179
why you'd want to thank her. You explain that you're glad you found her. Dawn says that she's happy

244
00:51:02,179 --> 00:51:22,760
too. Put handcuffs on Dawn. You put handcuffs on Dawn. You leave Dawn handcuffed to a chair.

245
00:51:23,829 --> 00:51:28,630
You go to your car and drive to the police station. You arrive at the station and find that Dawn has

246
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:40,409
been arrested. You call her cell phone. I forgot to bring her with me. Dawn answers. She answers.

247
00:51:46,900 --> 00:52:02,389
Break cell phone. Break Dawn's cell phone. You break Dawn's cell phone. You find that she's

248
00:52:02,389 --> 00:52:07,190
been arrested. You call her cell phone. She answers. Break her. Get rid of her cell phone.

249
00:52:10,469 --> 00:52:24,039
Burn Dawn's cell phone. How many does she have? You burn Dawn's cell phone. You drive to the

250
00:52:24,039 --> 00:52:28,360
police station. You park outside the building. You enter the building and find that Dawn has

251
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:56,389
been arrested. You call her cell phone. Dawn answers. Ask where Dawn is getting her cell phones.

252
00:53:13,269 --> 00:53:18,710
You ask Dawn where Dawn is getting her cell phones. She says that she doesn't know. You

253
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:22,949
say that you can find out yourself. You say that you'll never forgive her. You laugh. You say,

254
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:50,199
What do I say? You say you are under arrest. You say you are under arrest. Will quotes work now?

255
00:53:55,349 --> 00:54:18,519
You say enjoy 30 years in prison. Don't do quotes. Don't use quotes. Just say enjoy 30 years in prison.

256
00:54:35,059 --> 00:54:42,570
You enjoy 30 years in prison. Wait, what?

257
00:54:51,380 --> 00:55:08,019
You go to my car. You go to your car. You unlock your doors and drive off into the night. You drive

258
00:55:08,019 --> 00:55:20,860
home. You arrive home. You find that Dawn is gone. You call her cell phone. Dawn answers. She answers.

259
00:55:23,619 --> 00:55:47,340
Hello? She answers hello. She answers. End the time loop. She killed Dawn. You called her cell

260
00:55:47,420 --> 00:56:19,610
phone. She answers and says kill Dawn. She answers just quotes. Dawn must die and hang up. You start

261
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:22,570
crying. You realize that you've made a terrible mistake. You don't know how long you'll be able

262
00:56:22,570 --> 00:56:36,420
to live without her around anymore. You go to sleep. Wake up. You wake up. You're in a hospital bed.

263
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:42,340
A nurse stands before you. She tells you that you're going to die soon. You're told that you

264
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:48,980
have cancer. You're given a what the fuck? You're given a few options. You could choose to die from

265
00:56:48,980 --> 00:57:13,449
this or you could choose to live. Choose to live. You decide to live. You chose to live. You choose

266
00:57:13,449 --> 00:57:17,530
to live. You choose to live. You choose to live. You choose to live. You choose to live. You choose

267
00:57:17,530 --> 00:57:29,800
to live. You choose to live. You choose to live. I lived. You lived. You lived. You lived. You lived.

268
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:32,840
You lived. You lived. You lived. You lived. You lived. You lived. You lived. You lived. You lived.

269
00:57:47,179 --> 00:57:59,210
Wake up. Wake up. You wake up. You're in a room. The walls are white. You look around and see

270

487
01:45:21,500 --> 01:45:40,729
you grab his wallet and rip it open you take everything inside and throw it into the river

488
01:45:40,729 --> 01:45:44,649
the man screams and runs after you you run along the shoreline until you reach a bridge

489
01:45:45,800 --> 01:46:14,090
you jump off the bridge and land safely on dry land not you watch watch the man jumps after you

490
01:46:14,090 --> 01:46:22,939
but misses the safe spot he hits his head hard on a rock you look down and see blood coming out of

491
01:46:22,939 --> 01:46:39,420
your nose you quickly put your hand you sit up and slowly look behind you a large rock lies right

492
01:46:39,420 --> 01:46:47,270
where you were standing you can only guess that the man missed the safe spot i had fall damage

493
01:46:47,989 --> 01:47:16,310
the man is dead but his soul continues to haunt me you look down and see a hole in your forehead

494
01:47:16,310 --> 01:47:19,270
you try to wipe the blood from your eyes and then you realize that you are still alive

495
01:47:19,829 --> 01:47:23,430
you stumble back to the bank and collapse on the ground you gasp for air and cough up some blood

496
01:47:24,149 --> 01:47:39,220
you wipe my face well you've never played a classic text adventure before

497
01:47:40,100 --> 01:47:53,590
this is this is an ai dungeon it generates nonsense how can this guy have never played

498
01:47:53,590 --> 01:47:58,729
a classic text adventure before people just can pull out guns and shoot at each other

499
01:48:00,710 --> 01:48:06,550
you wipe my face and go back to staring at the ground you hear someone approaching hey what

500
01:48:06,550 --> 01:48:31,640
happened i fell off a cliff and broke my neck okay look at the bridge you look at the bridge

501
01:48:31,640 --> 01:48:36,359
and notice that there is now a big gap between you and the other side that's weird who would

502
01:48:36,359 --> 01:49:03,720
build a bridge like this maybe they just wanted to get rid of us take down the bridge you climb

503
01:49:03,720 --> 01:49:09,000
down the ladder and start climbing down the bridge as you do so you hear a loud noise you turn around

504
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:13,800
and see a huge boulder falling towards you you quickly scramble away from the bridge what was

505
01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:33,989
that this is like a hangover dream this whole thing is it just a dream it's just a weird

506
01:49:33,989 --> 01:50:05,850
dream that you might have ask the boulder why it fell you look at the boulder and ask why did it

507
01:50:05,850 --> 01:50:12,890
fall the boulder looks at you with its big stupid eyes and says because i'm dumb you laugh and say

508
01:50:12,890 --> 01:50:41,029
well at least you're not dead ask the boulder to join you look at the boulder and ask would you

509
01:50:41,029 --> 01:50:47,899
like to join me the boulder looks at you and smiles sure you both walk along the bridge together

510
01:50:48,460 --> 01:51:06,300
so how come you didn't tell anyone about this place am i doing my doing this correctly the boulder

511
01:51:06,300 --> 01:51:26,979
says no quotes the boulder says boulder says it is because of war no the boulder says is because

512
01:51:28,300 --> 01:51:53,420
it is too expensive don't speak for other characters oh right the boulder shrugs and

513
01:51:53,420 --> 01:51:58,859
says it was a secret project by an old rich guy who died nobody knows about it except me and you

514
01:51:59,579 --> 01:52:15,770
you smile and nod how much does it cost to join you the boulder sighs and says a lot and the boulder

515
01:52:20,170 --> 01:52:43,859
100 gold coins give the boulder 100 gold coins that's a lot right we lost the music

516
01:52:44,500 --> 01:52:52,979
you give the boulder 100 gold coins and it grins it starts walking faster wow that was easy now

517
01:52:52,979 --> 01:53:08,939
let's go find another way across the river follow the boulder into the forest look at the trees

518
01:53:12,090 --> 01:53:20,729
literally dumber than a rock literally scammed by a rock it's all right it'll be fine you look

519
01:53:20,729 --> 01:53:24,489
at the trees and notice that they all have the same strange pattern they seem to be trying to

520
01:53:24,489 --> 01:53:44,260
tell you something what is this examine the pattern recruit the trees after you inspect the

521
01:53:44,260 --> 01:53:49,380
patterns on the trees and notice that they are all different sizes the smallest one has five leaves

522
01:53:49,380 --> 01:53:55,829
while the largest has 20 this is some sort of code what is it saying it's saying join us

523
01:53:56,949 --> 01:54:17,899
join the trees you join the trees and they become your new home you then continue on your journey

524
01:54:18,840 --> 01:54:23,850
i think we should keep going there must be more trees out here yeah but where are we going to

525
01:54:23,850 --> 01:54:47,000
sleep tonight we'll figure it out go to the past go to the pasture sleep in boulder's arms

526
01:54:47,319 --> 01:55:14,619
you lie down on the boulder's chest and close your eyes you feel safe there okay i think we've got

527
01:55:14,619 --> 01:55:21,260
enough information for now let's get back to work you wake up and head back to work ask the boulder

528
01:55:27,960 --> 01:55:47,529
ask to ride the boulder ask to ride the boulder so we can like roll roll the boulder at roll the

529
01:55:48,409 --> 01:56:02,619
boulder downhill you asked to ride the boulder are you sure you asked to ride the boulder

530
01:56:03,180 --> 01:56:07,899
are you sure we don't have time to do this right now no i think we can make it happen

531
01:56:07,899 --> 01:56:17,739
all right then let's go you grab onto the boulder and start to climb ride the boulder down the hill

532
01:56:18,539 --> 01:56:38,520
you begin to climb down the hill there's no point in stopping let's just go as fast as possible

533
01:56:39,079 --> 01:56:43,159
you reach the bottom of the hill and stop where did we go we went through a tunnel

534
01:56:46,630 --> 01:57:05,060
investigate the tunnel how did he avoid that getting lewd you walk forward and see a large

535
01:57:05,060 --> 01:57:12,020
hole in the ground a small light shines inside the hole that looks like a cave where is it it's

536
01:57:12,020 --> 01:57:20,250
behind us you both enter the cave and it leads to a room with a table and chairs look under the

the restaurant is relatively easy you've got a decent kitchen so the only thing left to do

841
03:06:19,690 --> 03:06:24,250
is hire staff you contact several people in town who are willing to work at the restaurant

842
03:06:24,250 --> 03:06:31,670

965
03:34:39,850 --> 03:34:45,030

going on everybody welcome to the stream spend a hundred dollars on loop you begin to speak into

999
03:44:09,219 --> 03:44:12,819
your microphone the first few words are unintelligible the next few words are

1000
03:44:12,819 --> 03:44:17,540
unintelligible then you begin to understand what you're saying it's a mix between english

1001
03:44:17,540 --> 03:44:42,120
and a language you don't know go to the call of duty store and buy 500 loot boxes you walk

1002
03:44:42,120 --> 03:44:45,319
out the door and head towards the nearest store which looks like it's been completely gutted and

1003
03:44:45,319 --> 03:44:49,959
ransacked with a large amount of blood splattered all over the floor of the walls as well as the

1004
03:44:49,959 --> 03:45:15,129
front window smashed in leaving you with only a broken glass pane it's in the you walk out of

1005
03:45:15,129 --> 03:45:18,569
the door again this time you find yourself in a small alleyway a quick glance around reveals

1006
03:45:18,569 --> 03:45:30,739
that there isn't anything else in sight there's no one here either but i i go into the small

1007
03:45:30,739 --> 03:45:41,370
alleyway and open my card packs you open your packet pull out a pack of cards which you then

1008
03:45:41,370 --> 03:45:45,930
proceed to tear apart and discard in your haste to get them to work on the game you've just purchased

1009
03:45:46,729 --> 03:45:53,350
true very true everybody knows that there's only like 16 cards in that game that are worth having

1010
03:45:54,069 --> 03:46:35,000
your eyes light up as you see the name jay bum bum 7722 appear on your monitor and you quickly

1011
03:46:35,000 --> 03:46:39,479
send him a message thanking him for his subbing before closing your browser and closing your phone

1012

thanks for the sub bye thank the next 500 people in a row then turn off the stream

1013
03:47:13,379 --> 03:47:17,139
you turn off the stream and you're done with it for now as you sit down to play some games

1014
03:47:17,139 --> 03:47:20,979

1039
03:55:28,889 --> 03:55:43,430
live stream you turn on the live stream and see that the stream is still running it looks like

1040
03:55:43,430 --> 03:55:54,020
it's going to be a long day wait it was on this whole time what did they see while it was running

1041
03:55:54,579 --> 03:56:05,590
while it was on stream movies stream all right i'm gonna stream the lord of the rings

1042
03:56:06,809 --> 03:56:11,129
you look at the screen and see that they saw a lot of stuff but nothing really out of the ordinary

1043
03:56:11,690 --> 03:56:16,020
they saw you play a game called bubble bobble and then you played a game called tic tac toe

1044
03:56:19,700 --> 03:56:46,100
breathe a sigh of relief and open my lord of the rings extended edition blu ray bubble bobble is

1045
03:56:46,100 --> 03:56:55,670
a sick game talk to twitch chat i will i gotta get my stream started i gotta stream all the lord

1046
03:56:55,670 --> 03:57:03,399
of the rings you open the extended edition blu ray and you notice that there is a new movie playing

1047
03:57:03,399 --> 03:57:09,239
but it's not the one you were expecting it's called sorcerer king that's about a movie about

1048
03:57:09,239 --> 03:57:14,950
a sorcerer king who's trying to conquer the world this is a bootleg version of the thing we did

1049
03:57:14,950 --> 03:57:40,440
before live stream the fellowship of the ring you turn on the live stream and you see that is

1050
03:57:40,440 --> 03:57:44,120
indeed still running the only thing you can tell is that it looks like it's going to be a long day

1051
03:57:44,120 --> 03:57:52,260
the sun is setting and you are tired you close your eyes and fall asleep while the stream is

1052
03:57:53,459 --> 03:58:00,840
sleeping on stream while streaming the lord of the rings i know i'm not supposed to do this

1053
03:58:01,559 --> 03:58:30,379
but can you imagine if you came to a stream i can't do it i can't i'll get in trouble

1054
03:58:31,100 --> 03:58:35,319
i was gonna play like a five minute lord of the rings clip when i slept in my chair

1055
03:58:35,959 --> 03:59:06,729
i probably i'm probably gonna get like suspended now wake up do a parody video wake up and yell at

1056
03:59:06,729 --> 03:59:10,889
twitch chat for not hitting his subtrain goal you wake up and you realize you forgot to hit

1057
03:59:10,889 --> 03:59:14,809
your sub train goal so you decide to get on twitch chat and yell at them for not hitting

1058
03:59:14,809 --> 03:59:36,360
their sub train goal they don't seem to mind though so you go back to sleep wake up screaming

1059
03:59:46,379 --> 04:00:05,909
wake up and pause the movie tell the twitch chat omega low you wake up but you've realized you've

1060
04:00:05,909 --> 04:00:09,750
got to pause the movie you decide to get on twitch chat and pause the movie they don't seem to mind

1061
04:00:09,750 --> 04:00:50,309
though, you go back to sleep. Get suspended from Twitch for streaming Lord of the Rings and sleeping.

1062
04:00:51,350 --> 04:01:00,299
Oh, I spelled Twitch wrong. After getting suspended from 12th grade for streaming Lord of the Rings,

1063
04:01:00,299 --> 04:01:11,290
you decide to go on Twitch chat. After getting suspended from 12th grade for streaming Lord of

1064
04:01:11,290 --> 04:01:15,530
the Rings, you decide to get on Twitch chat again. But this time you are going to do something

1065
04:01:15,530 --> 04:01:24,459
different. So you're going to stream Lord of the Rings with no commentary. Just enjoy yourself.

1066
04:01:34,139 --> 04:01:42,139
Get banned from Twitch for repeat offenses. For a repeat offense.

1067
04:01:56,790 --> 04:02:00,549
After getting banned from 12th grade, you decide to get on Twitch again. But this time you're

1068
04:02:00,549 --> 04:02:07,079
going to stream Lord of the Rings with no commentary. Just enjoy yourself. The next day

1069
04:02:07,079 --> 04:02:12,280
comes, but your stream is still running. So much for being suspended. I didn't even get banned.

1070
04:02:17,819 --> 04:02:28,010
Pop in the two towers while you stream naked.

1071
04:02:31,020 --> 04:02:50,940
Surely this has to get you banned. The next day comes, but your stream is still running. So much

1072
04:02:50,940 --> 04:02:54,700
for being suspended again. The next day comes, but your stream is still running. So much for being

1073
04:02:54,700 --> 04:03:00,440
suspended again. The next day comes, but your stream is still running. I think it's broken.

1074
04:03:14,940 --> 04:03:20,440
Yeah, it's broken. MonkaS. MonkaS. MonkaS. MonkaS. MonkaS. MonkaS.

1075
04:03:21,399 --> 04:03:28,739
All right. I'm going to check on the other one. I want to do a Twitch adventure on the big one.

1076
04:03:28,739 --> 04:03:33,190
The one that's more elaborate than this. You know what I'm saying? We got to do like a Twitch

1077
04:03:33,190 --> 04:03:39,260
adventure on this one. Or even like opening up YouTube videos on it. You know what I'm saying?

1078
04:03:39,979 --> 04:03:44,729
All right. This one, we'll do one more of these and we should be good to go.

1079
04:03:49,770 --> 04:04:05,290
Reset. You are now in the middle of the third week of your suspension and it seems...

1080
04:04:07,750 --> 04:04:12,120
What? You're now in the middle of the third week of your suspension and it seems that it

1081
04:04:12,120 --> 04:04:17,719
has finally caught up with you. Your account was given a 24 hour ban and then a permanent one was

1082
04:04:17,719 --> 04:04:39,020
given out after that period of time had passed. What kind of sick joke is that? Turn the stream

1083
04:04:39,020 --> 04:04:45,260
back on naked again. Make a new account and do it again. You're now in the middle of the third week

1084
04:04:45,260 --> 04:05:01,590
of your suspension and it seems that it's finally caught up with you. Make a new account. I got IP

1085
04:05:01,590 --> 04:05:32,579
banned. Ban evasion. You know... No, I can't. I'm banned. I'm IP banned. Come on. Let's go.

1086
04:05:39,579 --> 04:06:00,920
No, I'm done. It's out. It's dead. I have to like reload this. Custom. Here we go.

1087
04:06:00,920 --> 04:06:25,739
You are a famous singer. You are about to write a new hit single. Here we go. You're a famous

1088
04:06:25,739 --> 04:06:29,020
singer. You're about to write a new hit single. Your career is on the rise and you have many fans

1089
04:06:29,020 --> 04:06:33,500
all over the world. But you have no idea what's going on in your life right now. What if you never

1090
04:06:33,500 --> 04:06:45,799
get out of this town? What if your career never gets off the ground? Start writing a new song.

1091
04:06:46,520 --> 04:06:56,790
But we're already... Yeah, we're famous. This isn't working for you. Maybe it's time to try something

1092
04:06:56,790 --> 04:07:01,110
else. Maybe it's time to move. Maybe it's time to just give up. The next day you leave the motel and

1093
04:07:01,110 --> 04:07:19,620
head back home. I just started. Write a hit song. Become a Twitch streamer in this one. No, we're

1094
04:07:19,620 --> 04:07:24,360
gonna do that on the other one. You decide to go back to the old routine of writing songs and trying

1095
04:07:24,360 --> 04:07:28,040
to sell them for money. But this would be different. This one will be different because

1096
04:07:28,040 --> 04:07:31,639
you can actually make money doing this instead of just sitting around doing nothing, which you've

1097
04:07:31,639 --> 04:07:49,500
been doing for years now. What are the song's lyrics? The first thing you do is take a pen and

1098
04:07:49,500 --> 04:07:54,219
paper and write down the lyrics of the song. Then you take the pen and paper and go sit in

1099
04:07:54,219 --> 04:08:03,579
your room by yourself and try to come up with some words that sound good. What words sound good?

1100
04:08:04,459 --> 04:08:16,440
I want a song out of this. You think of some random words that you think would be appropriate

1101
04:08:16,440 --> 04:08:19,799
for the lyrics of the song, but you don't know how to say them. So you don't say anything at all.

1102
04:08:21,159 --> 04:08:39,129
Write lyrics to the song. Well, like, I wrote. I wrote lyrics to the song, right? This isn't a

1103
04:08:39,129 --> 04:08:44,739
songwriter. You start writing lyrics on a piece of paper, then you put it in your pocket. Put

1104
04:08:44,739 --> 04:08:48,500
your keys in your pocket. This is the song. This is the song. This is the song.

1105
04:08:49,819 --> 04:08:53,420
You start writing down the lyrics on a piece of paper, then you put it in your pocket. Put

1106
04:08:53,420 --> 04:08:57,500
your keys in your pocket. Put your cell in your pocket. Grab a pen from the desk by the desk

1107
04:08:57,500 --> 04:09:10,139
and begin to jot down the words that come into mind. Right? Is that what this is? You put your

1108
04:09:11,260 --> 04:09:14,540
you put it in your pocket. You put your keys in your pocket. Put your cell in your pocket. Grab a

1109
04:09:14,540 --> 04:09:39,690
pen. Oh, what? What should I write? That was a kid's song. All right. I'm almost ready to move

1110
04:09:39,690 --> 04:09:46,920
to the other one. All right. We good. I'm hitting play on this one. That means it takes a minute to

1111
04:09:46,920 --> 04:10:13,620
load. We'll be back in a second. All right. Throw paper in the trash. You throw away the piece of

1112
04:10:13,620 --> 04:10:16,659
paper you were just jotting down. Then you look at yourself in a mirror and notice that you're

1113
04:10:16,659 --> 04:10:31,639
wearing a t-shirt with a picture of a girl on it. Take the t-shirt off. Picture of a girl on it.

1114
04:10:36,549 --> 04:10:39,190
You take off the t-shirt and notice that it has a picture of a girl on it.

1115
04:10:39,909 --> 04:10:43,780
Then you realize that you've been wearing the same shirt for weeks. So maybe it was just one of

1116
04:10:43,780 --> 04:11:02,469
those shirts that was hanging around in your room. That's fucking disgusting. I'm gonna get

1117
04:11:02,469 --> 04:11:07,110
some different music. We're gonna move on to the other one. This one's fun but this one seems like

1124
04:12:08,620 --> 04:12:11,340
Didn't you realize how stupid you looked when you were writing the lyrics to the song?

1125

1130
04:13:17,030 --> 04:13:21,350
word of the Church of the Savior of Mankind but today you have come to a revelation. It is time

of New Jerusalem. For years you have spread the word of the Church of the Savior of Mankind

1136

1139
04:15:01,129 --> 04:15:11,110
Maybe we should try a different approach, says Amanda. Ask Amanda what she wants to do.

1140
04:15:11,909 --> 04:15:40,739
I spelled her name wrong. Amanda to do. Well, I think we need to get more people here for

1141
04:15:40,739 --> 04:16:03,780
our meeting. Agree with Amanda and start recruiting. You agree with Amanda that it would be best to get

1142
04:16:03,780 --> 04:16:08,100
more people in attendance at the meeting so you decide to head over to the local bar where she

1143
04:16:08,100 --> 04:16:14,180
works. When you arrive you see several other people there but no one is paying any attention to you.

1233
04:36:14,479 --> 04:36:27,099
You are Father Michael. You've just killed God and are now sitting on his throne.

1234
04:36:27,099 --> 04:36:32,349
That's good. I had another identity though. Yeah, I did. Hold on.

1235
04:36:32,349 --> 04:37:06,020
You are, you are, you are the real J Bum Bum. Previously known, previously, previously known as, shit, as Father Michael.

1236
04:37:06,020 --> 04:37:18,220
You have killed God and are now sitting on his throne. I didn't kill him. You have just accepted, you are, yeah, I didn't kill God.

1237
04:37:18,220 --> 04:37:31,340
You have just accept, you have just accepted a golden ring from God. You are currently standing in his presence.

1238
04:37:31,340 --> 04:37:58,900
In throne room. Yeah, I don't know how you fucking spell it. This is the worst timeline we're talking about. Let's go.

1239
04:37:58,900 --> 04:38:18,560
I need a new song. You are the real J Bum Bum. Previously known as Father Michael. You've just accepted a golden ring from God.

1240
04:38:18,560 --> 04:38:29,169
You're currently standing in his presence in the throne room. I am proud to be your son. He says with an air of finality.

1241
04:38:29,169 --> 04:38:36,169
The kingdom is yours and you will rule it as its rightful ruler. He then looks at you and smiles.

1242
04:38:36,169 --> 04:39:01,250
Accept his proposal. Rowan, no, and accept, accept and rule the kingdom of God.

1243
04:39:01,250 --> 04:39:19,189
Yes, I shall do so, my son, you say with confidence. Good. Now that we have settled all matters, let us get down to business.

1244
04:39:19,189 --> 04:39:41,630
You look around the throne room and see several other people sitting on the floor around the throne. Ask who these people are. Who are these people?

1245
04:39:41,630 --> 04:39:49,630
Who are they? You ask. They are the leaders of the different factions in the kingdom. They are the ones who make up the government.

1246
04:39:49,630 --> 04:39:59,290
We need them to work together for our common good. Now what about you? Ask if you can run the treasury.

1247
04:39:59,290 --> 04:40:14,139
No, not you. No, me, me, me, me, me. I will take over as treasury head. I think it is time someone did something about the state of affairs here.

1248
04:40:14,139 --> 04:40:37,939
Tell God, tell old God he is now the janitor. Very well, but don't expect me to be running the treasury or anything.

1249
04:40:37,939 --> 04:41:15,060
Ask, throw a paper cup on the ground. Now you're just being an asshole. Ask the janitor to pick up the cup. What's wrong with you?

1250
04:41:15,060 --> 04:41:39,439
What? What? What are you talking about? What? Cast God, cast old God away. Finish him. Fool, I am your father. You must obey me.

1251
04:41:39,439 --> 04:42:03,259
Tell him I am the new God.

1252
04:42:03,259 --> 04:42:26,259
Well done. You've broken my hold on you. Tell God to go get a coffee for you. Fine, but I'm not going anywhere.

1253
04:42:26,259 --> 04:42:44,619
He snaps his fingers and a Starbucks Bente Americano appears in his hand.

1254
04:42:44,619 --> 04:43:12,099
Ah, thank you, sir. I'll be back later. All right, down to business. Ask the people what the first task is. He drank the coffee.

1255
04:43:12,099 --> 04:43:35,590
We need to clean out the basement. There's some treasure down there. Oh, no, no, no, I'm too tired. I've been doing it for years. You should just do it yourself.

1256
04:43:35,590 --> 04:44:17,709
All right, then I'll start cleaning the basement. Go to the top of the cloud. So how long until you will return? Tell them I will only be a few hours.

1257
04:44:17,709 --> 04:44:30,430
Oh, come on. You're telling me you haven't gotten a proper night's sleep in yet? I haven't. No, I've not slept in in heaven.

1258
04:44:30,430 --> 04:44:55,459
I take a nap in heaven. Yeah, right. It's not like I got any free time anyway. I got to get ready for the meeting tomorrow. Isn't that why I would go to sleep?

1259
04:44:56,459 --> 04:45:18,659
Go to the meeting. Yeah, I know. I was planning on coming early, but I guess I won't bother you. Yeah, heaven's boring. This is fucking boring.

1260
04:45:18,659 --> 04:45:41,240
Leave the room. Hey, wait a minute. Where are you going? Go to...

1261
04:45:42,240 --> 04:46:11,779
Burn heaven down. Ah, go back to earth. What the fuck are you doing? What were you thinking? Tell them to leave me. You them leave me alone.

1262
04:46:11,779 --> 04:46:26,689
You're crazy. You have to help me. Do not help them. It's too late. They're gone.

1263
04:46:26,689 --> 04:46:34,689
I swear I'll never let anyone hurt you again, because that's what happened last time. They took everything from me and I had to watch them kill my wife and my son and all my friends.

1264
04:46:35,689 --> 04:47:31,099
I can't believe you turned against me. I thought you were supposed to be my friend. These are prayers. Oh shit. That's who's talking. Bye. Goodbye.

1265
04:47:31,099 --> 04:48:03,939
I don't want to see you ever again or hear your voice again. Get out of this car. That's somebody mad at somebody else. Yeah, look, I'll cast a spell.

1266
04:48:03,939 --> 04:48:41,229
Oh, nice one. That was fun. It's stuck. Reset. That was just heaven politics. That sucked. New game. All right, we're gonna do one more. This is the last one. We're gonna do the Twitch one.

1267
04:48:41,229 --> 04:49:04,500
This one. I want the Twitch story. Get rid of the choir. This sucks. I just got demoted to god. Demoted god to janitor. I'm kind of bored.

1268
04:49:04,500 --> 04:49:31,450
No, I don't want that for the Twitch one. How about Home Depot? Put on some happy music. Anyone else think that Jerma kind of sucks now? All he does is stream Lord of the Rings movies while sleeping naked. How is he not banned yet? I don't know.

1269
04:49:31,450 --> 04:49:46,799
Take that up with somebody else. Here, here's like happy winter music. This is called mood booster music. All right. All right, not a random story. Custom.

1270
04:49:46,799 --> 04:50:41,459
You are Jerma985. You run a successful online business where you entertain millions of people. Today you are striving for just one more like. I bet the computer doesn't understand what that means. Today you are striving to gain some more followers. That's good.

1271
04:50:41,459 --> 04:50:59,990
You are Jerma985. You run a successful online business where you entertain millions of people. Today you're striving to gain some more followers. You've been running your business for quite a while now and it's gotten pretty big, but still not enough.

1272
04:50:59,990 --> 04:51:19,939
Log in to Twitch.tv. You log on to Twitch.tv and see that there is already a stream going on right now. It's a girl playing the piano. She looks really good though. You think she should be able to get a lot of viewers. You can't wait to hear her play.

1273
04:51:20,939 --> 04:51:54,509
Host this stream. Raid. Yeah. Raid this. Raid her. All right. Raid her stream. Raid her. Raid her. You decide to raid her stream since she seems like an interesting person and you don't want to waste time watching other streams. You start streaming on Twitch.tv and immediately you get a ton of views. This makes you feel great. Cool.

1274
04:51:54,509 --> 04:52:31,759
You begin stripping off your clothes as fast as you can, hoping that this will attract more people to watch. Soon you are completely naked and the audience is starting to gather around you. In person? Yeah, that makes no sense.

1275
04:52:31,759 --> 04:52:58,020
Give everybody a shout out. Yeah, I'm gonna get partnered. Quickly. You quickly give everyone a shout out, which causes them all to come over to your channel. They all seem very excited about it, but then they realize what you're doing and they start criticizing you for being so weird.

1276
04:52:58,020 --> 04:53:36,509
Tell chat they don't know anything. No, no. Say respect the streamer. No backseat gaming. You continue giving out a shout out and soon enough the audience starts getting upset with you because they know you're just trying to scam them. They tell you to stop and they tell you to go away.

1277
04:53:36,509 --> 04:54:28,759
Say, say, this is free content. You can just leave. You continue giving out a shout out and the audience gets even angrier at you saying that you're not welcome here. They tell you to leave and you do, but you keep giving a shout out to them. Start playing Fortnite. See if I can get you back.

1278
04:54:28,759 --> 04:54:46,409
You continue streaming on Twitch TV and suddenly you get a huge amount of viewers. You also get a lot of hate. You get a lot of hate from the audience calling you a liar and a thief. Eventually you have a riot and the audience tries to burn down your house.

1279
04:54:46,409 --> 04:55:09,659
Come out of my house swinging. You come out of your house swinging and you manage to escape with your life. You manage the next day to find out that your house was burned down by the mob and you lost everything.

1280
04:55:09,659 --> 04:55:30,389
Go to the library. I guess I stream from the library. You go to the library and you look up some information on how to make money online.

1281
04:55:30,389 --> 04:55:40,389
You learn that you need to create a fake name and a fake email address and then you can get, you can post stuff on various forums and such and make a little bit of money. Yeah. All right. Let's go.

1282
04:55:40,389 --> 04:56:02,119
Make a Twitch account. You create a new Twitter account under a different name and you set it to private. You then create a new Twitch account under a different name and you set it to public. You then register both accounts and you put them into the same Google account. You then log on to Twitch.

1283
04:56:03,119 --> 04:56:24,360
All right. It's a little OK. Start my first broadcast. You start broadcasting on Twitch TV and with a few hours you get a large number of viewers. You also get a lot of hate from the audience telling you to go away and you're not wanted here. How do you know?

1284
04:56:25,360 --> 04:57:01,169
I forgot to put my mask on. I forgot to put my mask on. I scramble to put my mask on to hide my identity. You hurry up and put your mask on and you try to stay anonymous, but you still get recognized by one of the viewers who recognizes you as the guy who rated their stream.

1285
04:57:01,169 --> 04:57:33,090
Tell them you are. Tell them they tell them they are mistaken. You tell them they're mistaken and that you were actually rating them and had nothing to do with it. You then proceed to explain why you did it and how you get caught. You end your broadcast.

1286
04:57:34,090 --> 04:58:08,250
Make a new Twitch account. No, no, no, no. Get in my car. Get in my car. I'm driving to a library like three towns over. You rush home and you drive to the library. You park near the entrance and walk inside. You take a deep breath and you open the door. You close the door behind you and you head straight to your computer room. Drive to a library far away.

1287
04:58:09,250 --> 04:58:23,009
You drive to a library far away and you spend the rest of the night there. When morning comes, you finally wake up and you finally realize what happened. You are arrested, convicted and sentenced to jail.

1288
04:58:24,009 --> 04:58:57,509
Avoid the police. You avoid the police and you never return to the city where you live again. After several years pass, you die in prison. No, I'm still alive. I didn't die. Revert, I'm using the jail computer.

1289
04:58:57,509 --> 04:59:33,659
Log on to the jail computer. You log on to the jail computer and you see that you are in prison. You are given a chance to plead guilty or not guilty and you choose to not to plead guilty. You make a new Twitter account under a different name and you set it to private. Create a new Twitch account under a different name. Set a public register in both. Put them in the same Google account.

1290
04:59:33,659 --> 05:00:26,380
Put a bag over my head and turn on broadcast so nobody can see me. You put a bag over your head and turn on broadcast mode on your computer. You have to type in the following code. This is my stream key.

1291
05:00:26,380 --> 05:01:09,200
You stream connect. Then you send the tweet. I tweeted out my stream key. You then send the tweet instantly and you get a lot of followers. You also get a lot of hate from the audience calling you a liar. A thief.

1292
05:01:09,200 --> 05:01:55,349
Okay, they can't see me though. Okay, tell the audience to calm down. Here, let's start fresh. You tell the audience to calm down and you explain that you didn't do anything wrong, that you only wanted to help someone else. Ask my viewers for money. I've got to hire an attorney. You ask your viewers for money and you get a lot of money and a lot of hate from the audience.

1293
05:01:55,349 --> 05:02:34,180
Okay, hire a very good lawyer. You hire a very good lawyer and he manages to convince the judge that you are innocent. Look at that. Leave prison a free man. You leave prison a free man and you live happily ever after. Congrats, you win.

1294
05:02:34,180 --> 05:03:12,979
That's a 10. One more. Random. Peasant time. This is going to be the last one. This will be it.

1295
05:03:41,380 --> 05:04:00,659
Come on! Finish the job!

1296
05:04:32,740 --> 05:04:34,740
He looks like he might die right there.

1297
05:04:34,740 --> 05:04:39,740
He looked down at the shovel and then back up at your master who has stopped moving. He doesn't seem to know what to do.

1298
05:04:39,740 --> 05:04:54,540
Jump with both feet in air and stomp and land on his head. What is this guy made out of?

1299
05:04:54,540 --> 05:05:10,340
You leap forward with both feet in the air. You land on top of your master's head and begin kicking him in the face. He tries to get up but you kick him in the stomach instead. He cries out in pain and starts clawing at his own face.

1300
05:05:10,340 --> 05:05:34,040
Kill him! Jesus! Smash his head with a rock! Hurry, kill him! Like, kill him! You slam your fist against your master's skull. The force knocks you backwards but not before smashing your master's head into the dirt. He crumbles to the ground. You stand up and walk over to your shovel. You pick it up and throw it at your master.

1301
05:05:35,040 --> 05:06:03,139
Run over master with car. You run over your master with your car. He screams in agony. As the front wheels tear through, flesh and bone, blood spurts all over you, your master. You stop running when you hear your master scream for help. You turn around and see two men approaching. He's still alive!

1302
05:06:03,139 --> 05:06:23,979
Throw a grenade at master. You throw a grenade at your master. It explodes harmlessly against the wall but you hear your master screaming in terror. You turn around and find that one of the men is holding a knife to your throat.

1303
05:06:23,979 --> 05:06:57,540
Dodge the knife. Watching it dodge the knife. Dodge the knife. You duck under the man's swing and spin around. You grab the knife and pull it free. The man screams in shock and runs off. You follow him and find yourself in another room. A young girl stands nearby looking at you with an expression of disgust.

1304
05:06:57,540 --> 05:07:19,459
Tell the girl what happened. You explain to the girl what happened. She seems very upset by it. She tells you she will go talk to her father about this. You thank her and leave the house.

1305
05:07:19,459 --> 05:07:36,049
I'm killing this motherfucker. Like I'm not letting this happen. I gotta finish him.

1306
05:07:36,049 --> 05:07:47,349
Find my master. You rush to where your master is hiding. You run past the guards and climb onto the roof. You crawl along this side until you reach the first floor. There's no way you can sneak up on your master so you decide to use magic.

1307
05:07:47,349 --> 05:08:06,200
Become invisible. You become invisible. You hide in a corner and wait for your master to come home. When he does, you attack.

1308
05:08:06,200 --> 05:08:16,919
You rip open his clothes and start tearing them off. You bite and scratch, ripping out his teeth and gouging out his eyes. This guy.

1309
05:08:16,919 --> 05:08:26,500
Crush his head under a large stone. Like can this guy die? Cur off.

1310
05:08:26,500 --> 05:08:38,639
You crouch down and try to lift a large stone that sits above the entrance to the cave. You fail and fall to the ground. You hear your master coming home and cry out in fear. He comes running and sees you lying there.

1311
05:08:38,639 --> 05:08:43,930
He lives in a cave.

1312
05:08:43,930 --> 05:09:04,979
Cast fireball at master. You cast a fireball at your master. It explodes in his face, burning it completely black. He screams in horror and runs outside.

1313
05:09:04,979 --> 05:09:11,979
You watch helplessly as he attempts to put out the flames with his hands. He fails and the fire spreads throughout the cave.

1314
05:09:11,979 --> 05:09:34,020
Cast another fireball at master. You cast another fireball at your master. This time it explodes in his chest, killing him instantly.

1315
05:09:34,020 --> 05:09:39,020
You watch in horror as the flames consume the cave. My god.

1316
05:09:39,020 --> 05:09:49,409
Leave the cave. You run back inside the cave and hide in the shadows. What?

1317
05:09:49,409 --> 05:09:55,709
You hear the sounds of battle outside and quickly make your escape. You don't want to be here anymore. I'm going to burn to death in the cave.

1318
05:09:55,709 --> 05:10:06,439
Go deeper into the cave. The game is rebelling.

1319
05:10:06,439 --> 05:10:21,279
You enter deeper into the cave. You soon find yourself in a small chamber. In the center of the chamber is a huge stone altar. On the altar is a human skeleton covered in blood. Above the altar is a statue of a snake eating its tail.

1320
05:10:21,279 --> 05:10:29,180
Eat my tail. That's what it wants me to do.

1321
05:10:29,180 --> 05:10:42,380
You take a deep breath and plunge your hand into the wound on your leg. You pull out the tail and devour it whole. You gulp down the blood and flesh and feel satisfied. You return to the altar and kneel next to the statue of the serpent.

1322
05:10:42,380 --> 05:10:46,380
I am granted immortality.

1323
05:10:46,380 --> 05:11:02,060
You raise your hand and touch the statue of the serpent. With a wave of your hand you create a portal and step through. You emerge in a different place. You see a bright light and hear a voice calling to you.

1324
05:11:03,740 --> 05:11:05,740
I am immortal.

1325
05:11:05,740 --> 05:11:18,779
You step through the portal and find yourself in a room filled with people. They're all smiling and laughing. You recognize some of them, but most of them you haven't seen before. One of the people approaches you.

1326
05:11:18,779 --> 05:11:23,240
Ask what they want.

1327
05:11:23,240 --> 05:11:26,700
I am immortal.

1328
05:11:26,700 --> 05:11:29,700
They smile and say, we just wanted to wish you well.

1329
05:11:29,700 --> 05:11:32,700
You nod and thank them and begin walking towards the exit.

1330
05:11:32,700 --> 05:11:43,959
Interrogate the men.

1331
05:11:43,959 --> 05:11:44,959
That's bullshit.

1332
05:11:44,959 --> 05:11:54,759
You approach the men and ask why he wants to speak to you. He says, well, I was sent here by my king to give you a message to you.

1333
05:11:54,759 --> 05:11:57,759
That I need you a message.

1334
05:11:57,759 --> 05:12:44,779
It's broken.

1335
05:12:44,779 --> 05:12:50,779
You approach the door and push the handle. As you open the door, it swings open. You notice it opens and closes. I can't.

1336
05:12:50,779 --> 05:12:53,779
That's broken. It's broken.

1337
05:12:53,779 --> 05:12:55,779
I gotta revert twice.

1338
05:12:55,779 --> 05:13:03,810
Okay, here we go. Tell him to back off.

1339
05:13:03,810 --> 05:13:10,950
You say, I'm sorry, but I need to speak to my master.

1340
05:13:10,950 --> 05:13:14,380
Go find your master.

1341
05:13:14,380 --> 05:13:19,740
Didn't that just blow him up?

1342
05:13:19,740 --> 05:13:23,740
You walk towards the group of people and they all stare at you. Some of them point their fingers at you and laugh.

1343
05:13:23,740 --> 05:13:26,740
Others call you names and curse at you. Finally, someone calls you a name.

1344
05:13:26,740 --> 05:13:29,740
You turn around and run towards the voice and find your master.

1345
05:13:29,740 --> 05:13:40,819
Kill him here so he goes back to Earth.

1346
05:13:40,819 --> 05:13:53,400
This is the only you say, hello master.

1347
05:13:53,400 --> 05:14:10,900
It's fucked.

1348
05:14:10,900 --> 05:14:22,860
Leave the cave. Let's see if I can get out of here.

1349
05:14:22,860 --> 05:14:30,180
Okay, you walk towards the exit of the cave and notice that the people are now gone.

1350
05:14:30,180 --> 05:14:33,180
You think about how strange that they would just disappear without warning you.

1351
05:14:33,180 --> 05:14:35,180
You wonder if you should go back to check on the cave or stay here.

1352
05:14:35,180 --> 05:14:44,900
You decide to put a nuke in the portal.

1353
05:14:44,900 --> 05:14:58,139
Mushroom Club.

1354
05:14:58,139 --> 05:15:04,970
Alright, that's it. That's it. It's over.

1355
05:15:04,970 --> 05:15:11,540
You decide to go to Disney. You decide to go to Disneyland.

1356
05:15:11,540 --> 05:15:22,540
You decide to take a vacation to Disney World.

1357
05:15:22,540 --> 05:15:29,509
You decide to take a vacation to Disney World.

1358
05:15:29,509 --> 05:15:31,509
You travel to various places in Disneyland.

1359
05:15:31,509 --> 05:15:32,509
You visit various places you've never been to.

1360
05:15:32,509 --> 05:15:34,509
You learn new things about people in the world.

1361
05:15:34,509 --> 05:15:36,509
You meet interesting people in places.

1362
05:15:36,509 --> 05:15:38,509
Okay, die peacefully.

1363
05:15:38,509 --> 05:15:46,700
You die peacefully in your sleep.

1364
05:15:46,700 --> 05:15:47,700
You're surrounded by friends and family who love you.

1365
05:15:47,700 --> 05:15:50,700
Your last moments are spent with them. You die. Game over. I win.

1366
05:15:50,700 --> 05:15:54,220
I went to Disney.

1367
05:15:54,220 --> 05:15:59,430
Alright, that's it. That's it. I'm out of here.

1368
05:15:59,430 --> 05:16:01,430
This is a journey.

1369
05:16:01,430 --> 05:16:06,139
I want to do one. I want to do like a...

1370
05:16:06,139 --> 05:16:11,709
Hold on.

1371
05:16:11,709 --> 05:16:14,709
I want to do like a... I want to be like Donald or something.

1372
05:16:14,709 --> 05:16:18,900
No, no.

1373
05:16:18,900 --> 05:16:21,709
Teach us how to play?

1374
05:16:21,709 --> 05:16:25,020
It's sort of complicated in a way.

1375
05:16:25,020 --> 05:16:27,020
You can go to...

1376
05:16:27,020 --> 05:16:29,020
There's a website you can use.

1377
05:16:29,020 --> 05:16:35,119
It's kind of a weird experiment.

1378
05:16:35,119 --> 05:16:37,119
Hold on. Custom.

1379
05:16:37,119 --> 05:16:52,299
You are Donald Duck of Disney's most iconic characters.

1380
05:16:52,299 --> 05:17:00,689
Today, you are making people happy at Disney World.

1381
05:17:00,689 --> 05:17:08,500
You are Donald Duck, one of Disney's most iconic characters.

1382
05:17:08,500 --> 05:17:13,500
Today, you are making people happy at Disney World by performing in a show called The Great White Way.

1383
05:17:13,500 --> 05:17:16,500
There's something very wrong with this picture. You're not even sure where to begin.

1384
05:17:16,500 --> 05:17:22,279
What?

1385
05:17:22,279 --> 05:17:34,060
No, I just don't...

1386
05:17:34,060 --> 05:17:47,319
This is the last thing you want to do, but it seems like it's the only way out of this mess.

1387
05:17:47,319 --> 05:17:49,319
The problem is your family's been living here for years.

1388
05:17:49,319 --> 05:17:52,259
Alright, I'm out. I'm out.

1389
05:17:52,259 --> 05:17:53,259
I'm out. I'm out of here.

1390
05:17:53,259 --> 05:17:54,259
I'm out. I'm out.

1391
05:17:54,259 --> 05:17:55,259
I'm out.

1392
05:17:55,259 --> 05:17:56,439
I'm out.

1393
05:17:56,439 --> 05:17:57,439
I'm out.

1394
05:17:57,439 --> 05:17:58,439
I'm out.

1395
05:17:58,439 --> 05:18:05,819
I'm out.

1396
05:18:05,819 --> 05:18:06,819
I'm out.

1397
05:18:06,819 --> 05:18:08,060
That's it.

1398
05:18:08,060 --> 05:18:09,060
Stream over.

1399
05:18:09,060 --> 05:18:17,540
See you later.

1400
05:18:17,540 --> 05:18:18,540
See you tomorrow.

1401
05:18:18,540 --> 05:18:20,159
Fucking goddamn it.

1402
05:18:20,159 --> 05:18:21,159
How do you play?

1403
05:18:21,159 --> 05:18:22,459
Okay.

1404
05:18:22,459 --> 05:18:25,770
I want to give those of you that want to know.

1405
05:18:25,770 --> 05:18:29,930
AI Dungeon is the name of the game.

1406
05:18:29,930 --> 05:18:31,930
You can get it on the App Store right now.

1407
05:18:31,930 --> 05:18:32,930
It's on iOS.

1408
05:18:32,930 --> 05:18:35,740
It's also on Android.

1409
05:18:35,740 --> 05:18:44,110
But the one I'm playing is specifically, it's a collab of, I guess, like the whole program.

1410
05:18:44,110 --> 05:18:46,110
It's not really a game, right?

1411
05:18:46,110 --> 05:18:50,630
You have to install a bunch of stuff.

1412
05:18:50,630 --> 05:18:52,869
Somebody's linked in the chat.

1413
05:18:52,869 --> 05:18:58,869
Essentially, this is a research project that has really kind of taken a mind of its own.

1414
05:18:58,869 --> 05:19:05,349
They have a Patreon, which you can go to and support it if you want.

1415
05:19:05,349 --> 05:19:10,349
Like they say on the website, if you go to, just go to AI Dungeon, you can get more info.

1416
05:19:10,349 --> 05:19:15,150
Go to AIDungeon.io.

1417
05:19:15,150 --> 05:19:24,159
You can read all about it.

1418
05:19:24,159 --> 05:19:27,720
It is available for whoever wants to do it, wants to play it.

1419
05:19:27,720 --> 05:19:31,720
The one I was on is that research, that collab research project.

1420
05:19:31,720 --> 05:19:33,720
It was a lot faster and a lot better.

1421
05:19:33,720 --> 05:19:38,430
The app is actually a lot more stable and easier to use than the PC version.

1422
05:19:38,430 --> 05:19:41,430
Then I would probably say to get the app version.

1423
05:19:41,430 --> 05:19:47,319
Was it on phones?

1424
05:19:47,319 --> 05:19:52,319
To capture the game though, I don't really have my iPad or phone set up or anything.

1425
05:19:52,319 --> 05:19:58,130
That was a lot of fun.

1426
05:19:58,130 --> 05:20:05,020
But I think there's only so much of that I can take in one day.

1427
05:20:05,020 --> 05:20:07,020
There's also the website too, that beta.

1428
05:20:07,020 --> 05:20:09,020
Beta.AI Dungeon is the one I was playing before.

1429
05:20:09,020 --> 05:20:13,020
That was not the one with the gray background or the black background.

1430
05:20:13,020 --> 05:20:15,020
The mobile version is the official one.

1431
05:20:15,020 --> 05:20:19,520
Okay, well there you go.

1432
05:20:19,520 --> 05:20:22,759
It is still very much an experiment.

1433
05:20:22,759 --> 05:20:27,759
Like somebody said before, I wouldn't really classify it as a game as much as an experiment.

1434
05:20:27,759 --> 05:20:31,150
That was hilarious.

1435
05:20:31,150 --> 05:20:33,650
Hope you enjoyed that. I'll see you tomorrow.

1436
05:20:33,650 --> 05:20:35,650
Tomorrow's mystery stream.

1437
05:20:35,650 --> 05:20:37,650
Because I don't know...

1438
05:20:37,650 --> 05:20:39,650
Oh, before I go.

1439
05:20:39,650 --> 05:20:41,650
Make sure the nomination channel is open.

1440
05:20:41,650 --> 05:20:46,409
You really only have another...

1441
05:20:46,409 --> 05:20:52,060
There's really only about six days to make nominations.

1442
05:20:52,060 --> 05:20:56,060
Because I really want to have at least three days to vote and make the videos and everything.

1443
05:20:56,060 --> 05:20:59,060
If you don't know what I'm talking about, at the end of the year...

1444
05:20:59,060 --> 05:21:01,810
I'm just like burping.

1445
05:21:01,810 --> 05:21:06,369
At the end of the year, we're doing another New Year's Eve Worst of the Year Awards.

1446
05:21:06,369 --> 05:21:14,049
There's two channels on the Discord right now.

1447
05:21:14,049 --> 05:21:19,049
There's New Year's Eve Award Discussion, New Year's Eve Nominations.

1448
05:21:19,049 --> 05:21:21,180
Does everybody get to vote?

1449
05:21:21,180 --> 05:21:23,180
Yeah, absolutely.

1450
05:21:23,180 --> 05:21:27,919
The categories are listed in the discussion channel.

1451
05:21:27,919 --> 05:21:32,919
That channel is for you to discuss all the categories with anybody.

1452
05:21:32,919 --> 05:21:34,919
That's where you can write whatever you want.

1453
05:21:34,919 --> 05:21:40,669
The nominations channel is only for you to nominate something.

1454
05:21:40,669 --> 05:21:42,669
There's a pinned message on both of those channels.

1455
05:21:42,669 --> 05:21:45,669
Go read the pins. They're very, very important.

1456
05:21:45,669 --> 05:21:52,580
I will give a quick breakdown of the nomination channel.

1457
05:21:52,580 --> 05:21:58,490
Because I know people want to hear that before they get official.

1458
05:21:58,490 --> 05:22:09,060
In your nomination, it has to be either a Twitch clip, a VOD timestamp, or a YouTube video timestamp.

1459
05:22:09,060 --> 05:22:14,900
The stream archive channel, there's a link to it in that pin,

1460
05:22:14,900 --> 05:22:19,900
has every single stream I have ever done over the last at least two or three straight years.

1461
05:22:19,900 --> 05:22:23,349
If you're looking for something in particular and you're like,

1462
05:22:23,349 --> 05:22:26,349
wait a minute, that's not on Twitch. That was seven months ago.

1463
05:22:26,349 --> 05:22:30,349
That stream that you're thinking of will be on the archive channel.

1464
05:22:30,349 --> 05:22:36,220
When you nominate something, make it short and sweet.

1465
05:22:36,220 --> 05:22:38,220
That channel is not to discuss anything.

1466
05:22:38,220 --> 05:22:44,220
It's only for you to write what category, a short sentence on what you're nominating,

1467
05:22:44,220 --> 05:22:47,220
and then the clip or video with a timestamp on it.

1468
05:22:47,220 --> 05:22:56,180
That's it. You really only have about six days to do it.

1469
05:22:56,180 --> 05:22:58,180
If you want to participate, I implore you to do so.

1470
05:22:58,180 --> 05:23:01,950
Can we play Surge 2 tomorrow?

1471
05:23:01,950 --> 05:23:07,200
I don't know. I'll have to be into that.

1472
05:23:07,200 --> 05:23:09,200
We'll see how I feel tomorrow about that one.

1473
05:23:09,200 --> 05:23:15,470
Let's go over the bits.

1474
05:23:15,470 --> 05:23:22,779
There were some big ones that I may have missed, but that's why I'm going over them now.

1475
05:23:22,779 --> 05:23:30,759
What was the stream when I was making movies and singing with the food alphabet?

1476
05:23:30,759 --> 05:23:33,759
That was Mind Show.

1477
05:23:33,759 --> 05:23:39,520
There's a nomination discussion channel. Oh yeah, there's two.

1478
05:23:39,520 --> 05:23:42,520
There's a discussion channel and there's a nomination channel.

1479
05:23:42,520 --> 05:23:45,520
The discussion channel is for talking about everything.

1480
05:23:45,520 --> 05:23:49,520
Nominations are only for just a submission. That's it.

1481
05:23:49,520 --> 05:23:53,860
They're both available right now.

1482
05:23:53,860 --> 05:23:58,290
Anyways, let's go to earlier this afternoon.

1483
05:23:58,290 --> 05:24:01,290
We had Sly161 gave 250 bits.

1484
05:24:01,290 --> 05:24:05,290
Hey, JermaDrewCrewExpert here. I've played all the games.

1485
05:24:05,290 --> 05:24:08,290
I have a few more on disk. Let me know if you need advice.

1486
05:24:08,290 --> 05:24:12,689
That's a lot.

1487
05:24:12,689 --> 05:24:20,939
I hope to one day have this many DrewCrew games installed on my Steam.

1488
05:24:20,939 --> 05:24:25,900
You got like 30 here. That's pretty great.

1489
05:24:25,900 --> 05:24:31,529
Those of you that are curious how many games it takes to be able to call yourself part of a DrewCrew.

1490
05:24:31,529 --> 05:24:36,139
There it is. Ow.

1491
05:24:36,139 --> 05:24:38,139
Thank you, Sly. I appreciate it. The 250.

1492
05:24:38,139 --> 05:24:43,209
A triple zero Neo. Thanks for the 250.

1493
05:24:43,209 --> 05:24:45,209
Holy fuck, man. I'm literally crying with laughter.

1494
05:24:45,209 --> 05:24:47,209
This is me laughing louder than I ever have before.

1495
05:24:47,209 --> 05:24:50,209
Please try chasing yourself and see what happens. Damn it.

1496
05:24:50,209 --> 05:24:58,720
Ah, damn it. That would have been funny.

1497
05:24:58,720 --> 05:25:00,720
I love shit like this, though.

1498
05:25:00,720 --> 05:25:04,720
There's at least a few times where my body hurt from laughing at some of this stuff.

1499
05:25:04,720 --> 05:25:06,720
It's just so bizarre.

1500
05:25:06,720 --> 05:25:10,049
It's just so out-fucking-rageous.

1501
05:25:10,049 --> 05:25:13,180
We had five community subs. Some JermaSucks.

1502
05:25:13,180 --> 05:25:18,180
Thank you, JermaSucks. You've been killing it with the subs recently, the last few streams.

1503
05:25:18,180 --> 05:25:21,049
Appreciate it.

1504
05:25:21,049 --> 05:25:29,139
AdorableCockroach. Not only did you give a ton of money, you gave some other donations that were not read.

1505
05:25:29,139 --> 05:25:31,139
Here's a thousand bits from AdorableCockroach.

1506
05:25:31,139 --> 05:25:34,139
This game is becoming self-aware. Run while you still can.

1507
05:25:38,009 --> 05:25:43,560
I did. Thank you.

1508
05:25:43,560 --> 05:25:45,560
Hey, PlankV2. Thanks for the 500 bits.

1509
05:25:45,560 --> 05:25:48,560
Jerma, you seem like the kind of guy that owns a mug that has his initials on it.

1510
05:25:48,560 --> 05:25:50,560
Jerma discussed. I do.

1511
05:25:50,560 --> 05:25:52,560
Also, I played the heck out of Zork when I was younger.

1512
05:25:52,560 --> 05:25:56,560
Those games always made me frustrated.

1513
05:25:56,560 --> 05:26:00,549
I do. I have a J-Cup. I do.

1514
05:26:00,549 --> 05:26:02,549
You can get them.

1515
05:26:02,549 --> 05:26:06,060
I have a J-Cup.

1516
05:26:06,060 --> 05:26:09,060
But that was like a thing with me and Kim.

1517
05:26:09,060 --> 05:26:12,060
I have a J-Cup, and she has a K-Cup.

1518
05:26:12,060 --> 05:26:15,060
It's like, oh, these are our cups. That one's mine. That one's yours.

1519
05:26:15,060 --> 05:26:19,060
It's not about having my initials on something. It's like a cute thing that me and Kim did.

1520
05:26:19,060 --> 05:26:22,000
I know. Whatever.

1521
05:26:22,000 --> 05:26:31,709
But thank you, Plank.

1522
05:26:31,709 --> 05:26:33,709
Appreciate it.

1523
05:26:33,709 --> 05:26:36,080
Zork. I don't remember if it was Zork.

1524
05:26:36,080 --> 05:26:40,080
KXZ. Thanks for the 5,000 bits. I missed it earlier.

1525
05:26:40,080 --> 05:26:43,900
5,000 bits. 50 dollars from KXZ. Thank you.

1526
05:26:43,900 --> 05:26:47,580
Merry Christmas, Jerma. Hope you're having a good time this festive season.

1527
05:26:47,580 --> 05:26:49,580
Also, a small tip for AI Dungeon.

1528
05:26:49,580 --> 05:26:54,580
The AI usually has an easier time understanding inputs if you were them in second person.

1529
05:26:54,580 --> 05:27:02,150
Yeah, after the first two, I started to kind of figure out how to make the game talk the way that I wanted it to.

1530
05:27:02,150 --> 05:27:04,150
It's still kind of odd, though.

1531
05:27:04,150 --> 05:27:07,349
Thank you, and thanks for the huge amount of money.

1532
05:27:07,349 --> 05:27:12,090
What is this image?

1533
05:27:12,090 --> 05:27:16,380
Hated Streamer dies in prison.

1534
05:27:16,380 --> 05:27:18,380
Christianity 2 reaches space with prayer.

1535
05:27:18,380 --> 05:27:21,380
Receives ring from God.

1536
05:27:21,380 --> 05:27:35,889
This is funny. This is funny. I gotta share this one.

1537
05:27:35,889 --> 05:27:51,299
Adorable Cockroach. You gave a ton of community subs as well as the huge amount of bit donations.

1538
05:27:51,299 --> 05:27:56,060
Thank you so much. Thank you KXZ for the five subs.

1539
05:27:56,060 --> 05:28:01,060
Another thousand bit donation from Adorable Cockroach. More.

1540
05:28:01,060 --> 05:28:07,290
When are you doing a sleep stream?

1541
05:28:07,290 --> 05:28:15,540
If I could get away with it, it might be funny to do it for like an hour, but have a reason why it's happening.

1542
05:28:15,540 --> 05:28:18,540
But you can't do that. You're not allowed to do that on Twitch.

1543
05:28:18,540 --> 05:28:24,259
Adorable Cockroach. Again, another nine dollars. Nine hundred bits.

1544
05:28:24,259 --> 05:28:26,939
Damn.

1545
05:28:26,939 --> 05:28:29,250
Long live the king.

1546
05:28:29,250 --> 05:28:32,000
Thank you, Adorable Cockroach.

1547
05:28:32,000 --> 05:28:34,000
When am I gonna do a gym stream?

1548
05:28:34,000 --> 05:28:41,860
I can barely turn my body right now. I can barely like walk around.

1549
05:28:41,860 --> 05:28:46,770
I'm like falling apart. You think I can lift weights right now?

1550
05:28:46,770 --> 05:28:56,049
Gym stream.

1551
05:28:56,049 --> 05:29:00,080
I actually do have to go to physical therapy.

1552
05:29:00,080 --> 05:29:01,080
Yeah.

1553
05:29:01,080 --> 05:29:06,020
I have to go actually to a, I have to go to a pain doctor and then physical therapy.

1554
05:29:06,020 --> 05:29:08,020
It's fucking just, it sucks.

1555
05:29:08,020 --> 05:29:12,020
But whatever. You do what you have to do. And that's what I'm gonna do.

1556
05:29:12,020 --> 05:29:16,250
What happened?

1557
05:29:16,250 --> 05:29:18,939
Um, I have a hernia.

1558
05:29:18,939 --> 05:29:23,240
And I have what they think is something called costochondritis.

1559
05:29:23,240 --> 05:29:26,479
Which means my rib cage sucks.

1560
05:29:26,479 --> 05:29:29,779
And is like locked up and inflamed.

1561
05:29:29,779 --> 05:29:30,779
Uh, the joints.

1562
05:29:30,779 --> 05:29:32,779
I don't know. It's stupid.

1563
05:29:32,779 --> 05:29:34,020
It's just dumb. Whatever.

1564
05:29:34,020 --> 05:29:36,020
It's just dumb. Whatever.

1565
05:29:36,020 --> 05:29:39,860
But yeah. No, I'm good.

1566
05:29:39,860 --> 05:29:42,169
Tara Alecron, thanks for the 250.

1567
05:29:42,169 --> 05:29:45,169
This was one of the funniest streams I've ever seen. I'm in tears.

1568
05:29:45,169 --> 05:29:47,169
I'm so happy to have been a part of it.

1569
05:29:47,169 --> 05:29:51,889
Glad you liked it.

1570
05:29:51,889 --> 05:29:55,150
I fucking thought it was funny.

1571
05:29:55,150 --> 05:29:58,150
But you know what my favorite part about this whole stream was?

1572
05:29:58,150 --> 05:30:00,150
Killing the old lady in the house.

1573
05:30:00,150 --> 05:30:03,150
And not knowing who she was or knowing her name.

1574
05:30:03,150 --> 05:30:06,150
But she had a note in her pocket for me.

1575
05:30:06,150 --> 05:30:09,150
That was probably the, that was the pinnacle of the whole night I think.

1576
05:30:09,150 --> 05:30:16,819
It was unbelievable.

1577
05:30:16,819 --> 05:30:17,819
Smelly boy, thanks for the 250.

1578
05:30:17,819 --> 05:30:23,819
I literally almost actually shit myself laughing at the Twitch streamer desperately trying to get banned story.

1579
05:30:25,819 --> 05:30:32,580
If you can afford them, the trigger point injections help my costochondritis.

1580
05:30:32,580 --> 05:30:34,580
That's one of the things we might do.

1581
05:30:34,580 --> 05:30:40,580
The only reason why I don't want to do a, uh, like a steroid injection into my rib cage.

1582
05:30:40,580 --> 05:30:45,500
Is I've heard it's not that great for you.

1583
05:30:45,500 --> 05:30:48,959
I heard you're not really supposed to do it that often.

1584
05:30:48,959 --> 05:30:53,389
And if you do, it's not the greatest thing to do all the time.

1585
05:30:53,389 --> 05:30:58,529
I know, you gotta be careful with steroids.

1586
05:30:58,529 --> 05:31:06,310
But it's not even 100% that that's exactly what's wrong.

1587
05:31:06,310 --> 05:31:11,380
It would make a whole lot of sense, but that is not, that's what they think it is.

1588
05:31:11,380 --> 05:31:17,590
And until, honestly, here's the worst part about this.

1589
05:31:17,590 --> 05:31:21,790
Let's give you the long and short of it.

1590
05:31:21,790 --> 05:31:24,790
About a year and a half ago I started to get pain in my back.

1591
05:31:24,790 --> 05:31:27,790
Like middle of my back and middle of my chest.

1592
05:31:27,790 --> 05:31:31,610
Just I would turn to be like, ah, fuck, I would turn.

1593
05:31:31,610 --> 05:31:32,610
Oh, fuck.

1594
05:31:32,610 --> 05:31:39,610
Almost like my center core in a straight line from the top of my shoulders down to my abdomen.

1595
05:31:39,610 --> 05:31:42,610
Front and back just hurt.

1596
05:31:42,610 --> 05:31:48,099
If I turn the wrong way, it's like pulling something and boom, hurting, boom, hurting, right?

1597
05:31:48,099 --> 05:31:52,409
Uh, six months ago, it started to get a little worse.

1598
05:31:52,409 --> 05:31:55,409
Like in the middle of my chest was actually starting to hurt.

1599
05:31:55,409 --> 05:32:00,580
I'd lean back and kind of spread my rib cage out and be like, ah.

1600
05:32:00,580 --> 05:32:03,270
So I've been going, I've been doing a bunch of tests.

1601
05:32:03,270 --> 05:32:07,700
And the weird thing about pain is what I've been told.

1602
05:32:07,700 --> 05:32:19,189
So many things cause pain that trying to find out what the exact thing that causes pain could take a lifetime.

1603
05:32:19,189 --> 05:32:22,200
So many things can cause back pain.

1604
05:32:22,200 --> 05:32:26,500
Almost every organ in your entire body can cause back pain.

1605
05:32:26,500 --> 05:32:34,790
It's just it's ruling out shit until there's nothing left to rule out.

1606
05:32:34,790 --> 05:32:43,290
And then you get a true diagnosis of something like a like a pain illness, something like a costochondritis or like a fibromyalgia or something.

1607
05:32:43,290 --> 05:32:44,290
Right.

1608
05:32:44,290 --> 05:32:47,290
And I'm just on that road to find out exactly what the hell's wrong with me.

1609
05:32:47,290 --> 05:32:49,360
Who knows?

1610
05:32:49,360 --> 05:32:52,900
I don't know.

1611
05:32:52,900 --> 05:32:57,790
That's medicine.

1612
05:32:57,790 --> 05:33:06,819
Is it caused from not exercising?

1613
05:33:06,819 --> 05:33:11,819
I contrary to maybe popular belief, maybe what people might think.

1614
05:33:11,819 --> 05:33:16,259
I actually I move around quite a lot.

1615
05:33:16,259 --> 05:33:18,259
I go for walks.

1616
05:33:18,259 --> 05:33:21,259
I go on errands every day.

1617
05:33:21,259 --> 05:33:23,259
Kim and I will go out and do things.

1618
05:33:23,259 --> 05:33:26,259
It's not I don't I'm not just like lying in my bed.

1619
05:33:26,259 --> 05:33:28,259
I don't just like stream and then go.

1620
05:33:28,259 --> 05:33:29,259
All right.

1621
05:33:29,259 --> 05:33:30,259
That was a good stream.

1622
05:33:30,259 --> 05:33:35,259
I just go in bed and just until tomorrow when I turn it on.

1623
05:33:35,259 --> 05:33:39,459
I'm fairly active when it comes to like walking around.

1624
05:33:39,459 --> 05:33:42,459
I walk around pretty much every day.

1625
05:33:42,459 --> 05:33:50,369
You don't sit in stasis until stream.

1626
05:33:50,369 --> 05:33:56,659
No, not really.

1627
05:33:56,659 --> 05:34:03,610
But to put a cap on it, my back hurts, my rib cage hurts and the middle of my chest hurts.

1628
05:34:03,610 --> 05:34:07,610
I was and it could be like two or three things going on at the same time.

1629
05:34:07,610 --> 05:34:11,040
I was diagnosed with a hiatal hernia.

1630
05:34:11,040 --> 05:34:16,040
That's probably what's causing the stuff in the middle of my chest that I you live with it.

1631
05:34:16,040 --> 05:34:20,040
You deal with it and you manage it until you eventually want to have surgery to remove it.

1632
05:34:20,040 --> 05:34:21,040
That's the only that's it.

1633
05:34:21,040 --> 05:34:28,060
The stuff with the back and the ribs might be something completely different.

1634
05:34:28,060 --> 05:34:30,060
So or maybe it's all the hiatal hernia.

1635
05:34:30,060 --> 05:34:31,060
I don't know.

1636
05:34:31,060 --> 05:34:35,900
It's just medical bullshit.

1637
05:34:35,900 --> 05:34:40,900
But it's not affecting me to a point where it's causing me any real problems.

1638
05:34:40,900 --> 05:34:41,900
Right.

1639
05:34:41,900 --> 05:34:42,900
I can still walk around.

1640
05:34:42,900 --> 05:34:43,900
I can still move around.

1641
05:34:43,900 --> 05:34:48,720
I just can't fast movements or moving too far in one direction.

1642
05:34:48,720 --> 05:34:52,720
Like, for instance, you guys, here's a perfect example of what I'm talking about.

1643
05:34:52,720 --> 05:34:54,720
Those are the drive cars.

1644
05:34:54,720 --> 05:35:04,720
You know, when you put the car in reverse and you turn to look out the back of your rear of your, you know, look out the back window.

1645
05:35:04,720 --> 05:35:10,720
You know, that movement that put my arm up, look out the barge.

1646
05:35:10,720 --> 05:35:17,569
That's when it really hurts.

1647
05:35:17,569 --> 05:35:19,569
It's movements like that in both directions.

1648
05:35:19,569 --> 05:35:24,110
That's what the rear view mirror is for.

1649
05:35:24,110 --> 05:35:26,110
I know I use my rear view mirror.

1650
05:35:26,110 --> 05:35:28,349
I use my windows and everything.

1651
05:35:28,349 --> 05:35:34,419
But that that movement people do, you know, you turn that far.

1652
05:35:34,419 --> 05:35:36,419
And also, I don't like I don't just trust the one mirror.

1653
05:35:36,419 --> 05:35:37,419
I got a look.

1654
05:35:37,419 --> 05:35:38,419
I got to see everything.

1655
05:35:38,419 --> 05:35:39,419
I got to fucking take it.

1656
05:35:39,419 --> 05:35:42,419
I got to look at the fucking sides and I can look at the back and then rear rear view mirror.

1657
05:35:42,419 --> 05:35:46,419
I got to look up and you'll miss something that rear view mirror.

1658
05:35:46,419 --> 05:35:47,419
You can't trust it.

1659
05:35:47,419 --> 05:35:57,299
You got to fucking get your whole peripheral for your head out the window.

1660
05:35:57,299 --> 05:36:10,389
Yeah, that was a very long winded story, but that's kind of where it's at now.

1661
05:36:10,389 --> 05:36:12,389
But thank you smelly boy for the 250.

1662
05:36:12,389 --> 05:36:13,389
Yeah, I had a lot of fun.

1663
05:36:13,389 --> 05:36:20,389
This is besides the obviously the times are crashed and we were, you know, dead air for about five, 10 straight minutes.

1664
05:36:20,389 --> 05:36:21,389
It was hilarious.

1665
05:36:21,389 --> 05:36:22,389
I had a lot of fun.

1666
05:36:22,389 --> 05:36:26,130
Bala koala.

1667
05:36:26,130 --> 05:36:27,130
Thanks for the 500 bits.

1668
05:36:27,130 --> 05:36:28,130
God is dead.

1669
05:36:28,130 --> 05:36:30,130
God remains dead.

1670
05:36:30,130 --> 05:36:31,130
We have killed him.

1671
05:36:31,130 --> 05:36:34,130
How shall we come fund ourselves and murderers?

1672
05:36:34,130 --> 05:36:36,299
This is an entire W thing.

1673
05:36:36,299 --> 05:36:37,299
I don't I'm not.

1674
05:36:37,299 --> 05:36:38,299
Shall we?

1675
05:36:38,299 --> 05:36:39,299
I don't want to do this.

1676
05:36:40,299 --> 05:36:45,299
I'm not reading this whole thing with like the we names thing with everything.

1677
05:36:45,299 --> 05:36:47,299
It's just R is W kill.

1678
05:36:47,299 --> 05:36:48,299
I killed him.

1679
05:36:48,299 --> 05:36:50,299
Now, that's what you get.

1680
05:36:50,299 --> 05:36:51,299
I'm not doing anymore.

1681
05:36:51,299 --> 05:36:54,740
What festival was atonement?

1682
05:36:54,740 --> 05:36:56,740
What sacred gangs shall we have?

1683
05:36:56,740 --> 05:36:57,740
No, none done.

1684
05:36:57,740 --> 05:36:58,740
Thanks for 500 bits.

1685
05:36:58,740 --> 05:36:59,740
Bala koala.

1686
05:36:59,740 --> 05:37:00,740
Appreciate it.

1687
05:37:00,740 --> 05:37:02,619
Sad Vega.

1688
05:37:02,619 --> 05:37:03,619
Thanks for 250.

1689
05:37:03,619 --> 05:37:04,619
Merry Christmas.

1690
05:37:04,619 --> 05:37:07,619
Here's a lot of money you asked for us for the lawyer.

1691
05:37:07,619 --> 05:37:11,479
Thank you.

1692
05:37:11,479 --> 05:37:13,490
Sad Vega.

1693
05:37:13,490 --> 05:37:14,490
Esparza Escalada.

1694
05:37:14,490 --> 05:37:15,490
Thanks for the 500 bits.

1695
05:37:15,490 --> 05:37:17,659
Here's some money for your legal defense.

1696
05:37:17,659 --> 05:37:20,659
Even if you are a liar and a thief and you killed God and destroyed heaven.

1697
05:37:20,659 --> 05:37:23,659
Really sorry about burning down your house.

1698
05:37:23,659 --> 05:37:26,659
Really though, this stream made me laugh till my stomach hurt.

1699
05:37:26,659 --> 05:37:29,930
These little products tend to do it.

1700
05:37:29,930 --> 05:37:33,090
It's all right.

1701
05:37:33,090 --> 05:37:36,419
I probably deserve it.

1702
05:37:36,419 --> 05:37:37,419
Hey, Michael smells.

1703
05:37:37,419 --> 05:37:38,419
Thanks for the 300 bits.

1704
05:37:38,419 --> 05:37:39,419
Hey, German.

1705
05:37:39,419 --> 05:37:42,419
Can you please say Liz, you are epic and my best friend ever.

1706
05:37:42,419 --> 05:37:43,419
And I thought this would be a good present.

1707
05:37:43,419 --> 05:37:46,419
Now that you've said their name, you have seven days.

1708
05:37:46,419 --> 05:37:47,849
What?

1709
05:37:47,849 --> 05:37:49,919
Seven days for what?

1710
05:37:49,919 --> 05:37:58,819
What happens after seven days?

1711
05:37:58,819 --> 05:38:00,819
I didn't watch any videotape.

1712
05:38:00,819 --> 05:38:06,150
Anime big boy.

1713
05:38:06,150 --> 05:38:07,150
Thanks for 300 bits.

1714
05:38:07,150 --> 05:38:09,150
The stream was great and I really enjoyed myself.

1715
05:38:09,150 --> 05:38:13,330
When is the next big anime game?

1716
05:38:13,330 --> 05:38:14,330
I don't know.

1717
05:38:14,330 --> 05:38:17,330
I don't know if there's ever been a first.

1718
05:38:17,330 --> 05:38:18,330
Thank you though.

1719
05:38:18,330 --> 05:38:19,330
Appreciate it.

1720
05:38:19,330 --> 05:38:23,000
Let's switch over.

1721
05:38:23,000 --> 05:38:26,560
Let's switch gears to the theater.

1722
05:38:26,560 --> 05:38:28,740
Throw in the credits.

1723
05:38:28,740 --> 05:38:30,869
Thanks again for watching, everybody.

1724
05:38:30,869 --> 05:38:32,869
We'll see you tomorrow for a mystery stream.

1725
05:38:32,869 --> 05:38:33,869
It could be the Surge 2.

1726
05:38:33,869 --> 05:38:35,869
Could be Dead Rising 3.

1727
05:38:35,869 --> 05:38:42,869
Could be Nancy Drew, Sea of Thieves.

1728
05:38:42,869 --> 05:38:44,299
Whatever it was.

1729
05:38:44,299 --> 05:38:45,299
Could be anything.

1730
05:38:45,299 --> 05:38:46,299
It's a mystery stream.

1731
05:38:46,299 --> 05:38:51,590
It could be Jump King DLC.

1732
05:38:51,590 --> 05:38:54,020
It's not going to be Jump King DLC.

1733
05:38:54,020 --> 05:38:59,400
Could be Red Alert 2.

1734
05:38:59,400 --> 05:39:00,580
I don't know.

1735
05:39:00,580 --> 05:39:01,750
It could be anything.

1736
05:39:01,750 --> 05:39:03,750
It could be Sea of Thieves.

1737
05:39:03,750 --> 05:39:09,220
Could it be Salmon Max?

1738
05:39:09,220 --> 05:39:10,220
No.

1739
05:39:10,220 --> 05:39:11,650
I told you already.

1740
05:39:11,650 --> 05:39:12,650
I know.

1741
05:39:12,650 --> 05:39:13,650
I'm sorry.

1742
05:39:13,650 --> 05:39:14,650
Season 3 just didn't do it for me.

1743
05:39:14,650 --> 05:39:15,650
I'm sorry.

1744
05:39:15,650 --> 05:39:16,650
I really liked the first two seasons.

1745
05:39:16,650 --> 05:39:17,650
They were very good.

1746
05:39:17,650 --> 05:39:18,650
I just didn't lie about Salmon Max.

1747
05:39:18,650 --> 05:39:19,650
I already covered those bases.

1748
05:39:19,650 --> 05:39:20,650
My money.

1749
05:39:20,650 --> 05:39:21,650
What do you guys think I'm going to do?

1750
05:39:21,650 --> 05:39:22,650
Disco Alcium?

1751
05:39:22,650 --> 05:39:23,650
Hmm.

1752
05:39:23,650 --> 05:39:24,650
Yeah, that could be.

1753
05:39:24,650 --> 05:39:26,080
But that's a long game.

1754
05:39:26,080 --> 05:39:27,080
Hey, very nice.

1755
05:39:27,080 --> 05:39:28,319
Thanks for Thousand Bits.

1756
05:39:28,319 --> 05:39:29,319
I visited a Buddhist temple in southern Japan last year to clear my head and gain spiritual

1757
05:39:29,319 --> 05:39:30,319
enlightenment.

1758
05:39:30,319 --> 05:39:31,319
Unfortunately, it was closed due to being the wrong season.

1759
05:39:31,319 --> 05:39:32,319
And I had to obey the rules.

1760
05:39:32,319 --> 05:39:34,200
I'm sorry.

1761
05:39:34,200 --> 05:39:35,200
Hey, very nice.

1762
05:39:35,200 --> 05:39:36,200
Thanks for Thousand Bits.

1763
05:39:36,200 --> 05:39:40,200
I visited a Buddhist temple in southern Japan last year to clear my head and gain spiritual

1764
05:39:40,200 --> 05:39:41,200
enlightenment.

1765
05:39:41,200 --> 05:39:44,439
Unfortunately, it was closed due to being the wrong season.

1766
05:39:44,439 --> 05:39:47,439
And I had to walk back down the mountain.

1767
05:39:47,439 --> 05:39:54,389
If you had a round-trip ticket to anywhere in the world, where would you go and why?

1768
05:39:54,389 --> 05:39:56,389
Is that real?

1769
05:39:56,389 --> 05:39:59,139
That sucks, man.

1770
05:39:59,139 --> 05:40:06,479
If I could go anywhere round-trip, why?

1771
05:40:06,479 --> 05:40:09,479
Okay, I want to go to Antarctica.

1772
05:40:09,479 --> 05:40:15,970
Do I get an infinite amount of money?

1773
05:40:15,970 --> 05:40:22,970
I want to be in one of those big three jackets where I'm just waddling like a toddler around,

1774
05:40:22,970 --> 05:40:27,529
looking at ice crystals and penguins and stuff.

1775
05:40:27,529 --> 05:40:34,819
I need to have like 10 people that I hire that come with me to make sure I stay alive.

1776
05:40:34,819 --> 05:40:35,819
Does that include money?

1777
05:40:35,819 --> 05:40:37,819
I have infinite money, right?

1778
05:40:37,819 --> 05:40:43,639
Yeah, I need 10 people for that.

1779
05:40:43,639 --> 05:40:50,759
I want to have the cold, chilly, white booger crystal face.

1780
05:40:50,759 --> 05:40:56,759
Well, I'm just like, I want to do it.

1781
05:40:56,759 --> 05:41:00,580
And go look at the ice and the glaciers.

1782
05:41:00,580 --> 05:41:05,779
I mean, the second answer is I'd go to Japan and go to Tokyo.

1783
05:41:05,779 --> 05:41:07,779
I want to do that.

1784
05:41:07,779 --> 05:41:08,779
That's number two.

1785
05:41:08,779 --> 05:41:12,270
You said anywhere and do anything in the world.

1786
05:41:18,759 --> 05:41:22,759
Okay, just because you want to go to Tokyo,

1787
05:41:22,759 --> 05:41:26,759
that has nothing to do with how much I enjoy anime.

1788
05:41:26,759 --> 05:41:28,759
It's an interesting place on Earth.

1789
05:41:28,759 --> 05:41:34,450
You know, guys, I think I really want to go to Japan because of how much I love anime.

1790
05:41:34,450 --> 05:41:36,709
What?

1791
05:41:36,709 --> 05:41:42,659
It's one of the most culturally dense places on Earth.

1792
05:41:42,659 --> 05:41:44,659
I like the anime.

1793
05:41:44,659 --> 05:41:47,560
I want to go.

1794
05:41:47,560 --> 05:41:56,880
I want to go and see everything and take in everything.

1795
05:41:56,880 --> 05:42:00,299
Yeah.

1796
05:42:00,299 --> 05:42:01,299
But yeah, there you go.

1797
05:42:01,299 --> 05:42:03,299
I want to go to Antarctica.

1798
05:42:03,299 --> 05:42:05,979
And I want to get infinite money.

1799
05:42:05,979 --> 05:42:10,979
I want like a $60,000 camera with a lens that's as big as a telescope.

1800
05:42:10,979 --> 05:42:12,979
And I want to even if I don't know what I'm doing, who cares?

1801
05:42:12,979 --> 05:42:13,979
There's 10 people.

1802
05:42:13,979 --> 05:42:15,979
There's 10 people that have to fucking deal with me.

1803
05:42:15,979 --> 05:42:17,979
One of them is going to be a professional photographer.

1804
05:42:17,979 --> 05:42:25,610
So I can just pretend like I'm a really good photographer and like typically pictures of polar bears and stuff like I'm going to have the guy set up the shot.

1805
05:42:25,610 --> 05:42:27,610
And then I go move, please.

1806
05:42:27,610 --> 05:42:35,090
And I go down and I looked in and I do a little bit of focusing, do rack focus, change the f-stop, click.

1807
05:42:35,090 --> 05:42:44,990
And it's my photo.

1808
05:42:44,990 --> 05:42:46,990
There are no polar bears in Antarctica.

1809
05:42:46,990 --> 05:42:51,979
Well, whatever.

1810
05:42:51,979 --> 05:42:58,319
I'll take a picture of a seal or a penguin.

1811
05:42:58,319 --> 05:43:01,319
Hey, Jude, Minecraft, thanks for 300 bits.

1812
05:43:01,319 --> 05:43:02,319
Thank you for your wonderful streams.

1813
05:43:02,319 --> 05:43:03,319
You always help me through rough times.

1814
05:43:03,319 --> 05:43:04,319
Love you streams.

1815
05:43:04,319 --> 05:43:05,319
Hope your holidays are nice.

1816
05:43:05,319 --> 05:43:07,319
Hope your holidays are good as well.

1817
05:43:07,319 --> 05:43:11,900
Thank you for the 300 bits and this nice statement.

1818
05:43:11,900 --> 05:43:12,900
Thank you.

1819
05:43:12,900 --> 05:43:18,130
And then we had a drummage door for the 250.

1820
05:43:18,130 --> 05:43:22,130
I have a J-cup, a J-cup.

1821
05:43:22,130 --> 05:43:24,259
Okay.

1822
05:43:24,259 --> 05:43:26,259
This is like an image I'm not putting on stream.

1823
05:43:26,259 --> 05:43:32,259
This is just actually I'm not clicking that and I don't don't click that one.

1824
05:43:32,259 --> 05:43:33,259
I don't know.

1825
05:43:33,259 --> 05:43:34,259
I thought that was a Jupiter.

1826
05:43:34,259 --> 05:43:36,259
I thought you were talking about you have like a juke.

1827
05:43:36,259 --> 05:43:37,259
Thank you for the 250.

1828
05:43:37,259 --> 05:43:38,259
Appreciate it.

1829
05:43:38,259 --> 05:43:42,259
Snoozingcopter, finally just the mandatory bit message so I'm still allowed to watch the streams.

1830
05:43:42,259 --> 05:43:43,259
Good night, Jermis.

1831
05:43:43,259 --> 05:43:44,259
See you tomorrow.

1832
05:43:44,259 --> 05:43:45,259
To the fence painting stream.

1833
05:43:45,259 --> 05:43:46,259
Looking forward to it.

1834
05:43:46,259 --> 05:43:47,259
Could be anything.

1835
05:43:47,259 --> 05:43:48,259
It's a mystery stream.

1836
05:43:48,259 --> 05:43:49,259
It could be anything.

1837
05:43:49,259 --> 05:44:00,549
It could be anything.

1838
05:44:00,549 --> 05:44:09,729
Why does it sound like Dr. Evil music?

1839
05:44:09,729 --> 05:44:12,310
All right.

1840
05:44:12,310 --> 05:44:13,310
See you guys tomorrow.

1841
05:44:13,310 --> 05:44:20,310
Giant enemy bond.

1842
05:44:20,310 --> 05:44:25,090
I'm going to go watch Austin Powers.

1843
05:44:25,090 --> 05:44:26,090
You should.

1844
05:44:26,090 --> 05:44:27,330
They're great movies.

1845
05:44:27,330 --> 05:44:37,099
Actually, the movies, those movies are hilarious.

1846
05:44:37,099 --> 05:44:45,069
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

1847
05:44:45,069 --> 05:44:46,310
See you tomorrow.

1848
05:44:46,310 --> 05:44:47,310
Good night.

1849
05:44:47,310 --> 05:45:27,270
See you tomorrow.

1850
05:45:27,270 --> 05:45:27,770
Good night.
