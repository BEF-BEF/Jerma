00:00:00,000 --> 00:11:11,840
Just one sec, hold on. Working on something real quick. Hello, how are you? Good to see

2
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:20,029
everybody again. Just got to make sure I get this settled to go here. Hi, welcome to the

3
00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:24,549
stream everybody. I'm sure a lot of you are probably pretty curious as to the title of

4
00:11:24,549 --> 00:11:31,350
the stream. And I've been gone for a few days, so let me sit down here. Am I in frame? Can you see me,

5
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:37,080
you know, everybody sit down here? So people are probably wondering what this stream is about. I've

6
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:46,460
been hyping it up for a couple months now. And of course, how do you describe your retirement? How

7
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:52,549
do you describe that? Because I've been doing this for about 10 to 12 years now. And as I've gone over

8
00:11:52,549 --> 00:12:01,000
the last 10 years, I've never really had to think about this. And what I want to do, even if I decide

9
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,279
that I'm done, right? Like even if I'm done with Twitch, I'm done with streaming, I'm done with

10
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:14,730
YouTube, whatever it is. I ain't going anywhere because the brand needs to live on permanently.

11
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:19,929
And I tried to figure out what that meant. How do I do that? How do I, how do I let my legacy

12
00:12:20,809 --> 00:12:27,450
continue? And oh, do you stream for like another five to 10 years? I don't fucking think so. I don't

13
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:34,220
think so, guys. So what I've decided to do is over the last few months, we've scoured the country

14
00:12:35,179 --> 00:12:43,100
trying to find who I think could potentially be able to replace me. And this brand and this stream,

15
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:49,580
because I'm going, look, I'm going anywhere, okay? I might be stopping at some point in the future

16
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:55,509
here, but I ain't going anywhere. This brand is not going anywhere. I'm sticking around forever.

17
00:12:55,509 --> 00:13:01,080
And I'm going to make sure of it today. So without further ado, what we have done is we've scoured

18
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:09,000
the country, various classified ads and newspapers, various boards of who would want to take the reign

19
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,820
of German at 85 because it's a very, very important reign, incredibly important reign. I've been here

20
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:24,409
for 12 years. It's got to go on and I need a 20% royalty, permanently. So we have scoured the

21
00:13:24,409 --> 00:13:30,889
country. We have a group of people that I'm willing to at least assess if they can handle it or not.

22
00:13:30,889 --> 00:13:34,169
So what we're going to do is we're going to have to go ahead and go and send in number one, please.

23
00:13:35,929 --> 00:13:45,159
For who could be my replacement? Number one. How you doing number one? Very well. You've chosen

24
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:51,500
Dark Souls, I think is your game. Go ahead. Yes. Oh, all right.

25
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:58,519
Looks like we are playing some Dark Souls three here. That's right. Okay. Jumping around. I think

26
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:02,519
maybe I'm just going to roll the whole time. Oh, there's a guy right there. All right. I'm going

27
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:08,679
to try to roll past. Okay. Yep. I'm just going to roll here. Yep. I'm just going to keep roll. Oh,

28
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:13,399
there's another guy. Okay. Oh, I'm just going to roll. I'm just going to roll past here. Wait,

29
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:17,720
what was this thing? What did that say right there? Oh, okay. I'm just going to keep rolling.

30
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:35,799
I'm going to roll. I'm just going to roll. So I'm going to go around the curve here. What is up

31
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:41,000
here? I think aren't there supposed to be fights in this game? What is going on? I thought this

32
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,450
game was hard. Set the bonfire. Set the bonfire here. Do you know what that does? Yeah. I'm going

33
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:54,409
to light the bonfire, get some nice save point here. What's the bonfire do? It rests. I'm going

34
00:14:54,409 --> 00:15:07,820
to rest here. What else does it do? It rests and it's a checkpoint. Yep. All right. He doesn't need

35
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:21,110
to be alive anymore here, I think. All right. Keep on going. There's a bonfire. Oh my god,

36
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:29,590
get out of the way. No, you guys. No, go, go, go, go, go. Okay. Okay. No, everything's fine.

37
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:35,659
Everything's fine. We're okay. We're okay. We're okay. Okay. We're okay. All right. What is this

38
00:15:35,659 --> 00:15:40,700
guy? He doesn't look, this guy doesn't look very scary. No, I think I got this guy. He's like on a

39
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:46,379
knee. What's the big deal about that? Hey, what are you doing over here? You're just chilling.

40
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:54,220
It's a nice weapon. Oh, what was that? You can't shoot me from over there. That's not fair. What

41
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,500
do you think you're doing here? I would definitely do something like that. Maybe I'm going to back

42
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:02,299
step. Oh, nothing. You are, you are nothing. Oh, oh, here, here we go. Remove sword. All right. So

43
00:16:02,299 --> 00:16:07,500
I'm going to remove the sword. What's the worst that could happen? Have you played Dark Souls

44
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:13,580
before? Great. I have played a little Dark Souls. This is what, what is, okay. All right. He's

45
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:17,659
moving now. That's all right. That's all right. I just, I'm going to go back to my strategy of

46
00:16:17,659 --> 00:16:27,820
rolling here, I think maybe. And that's, well, I mean, I hear people just roll, right? You just,

47
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:33,340
you just roll and then you roll. Look, I'm, I'm doing, I'm doing all right. You know, I think,

48
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:38,860
that's all right. I got, I'm alive. I'm alive. I'm alive. It's okay. It's okay. It's all right.

49
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:45,610
It's all right. Okay. I'm going to take a Estus Flask here. There we're all right. I think I can

50
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:50,009
take at least two more hits, right? We're all right. We're all right. Yeah. It's okay. Oh,

51
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:58,970
it's all right. That's all right. I got this. I got this. He's all right. He was supposed to

52
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:06,490
roll. He didn't roll. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't, I don't, I, uh, thank you so much. So if you could

53
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:11,509
go ahead and that's, uh, I think I've seen enough. Yes. All right. Thank you. Thank you so much.

54
00:17:11,509 --> 00:17:17,829
Thank you very much. Thank you. Can we send a number two, please? Hey, how are you doing?

55
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:24,779
I'm doing well. Take a seat. Yeah. All right. All right. What are we going to be playing today?

56
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:32,700
Uh, a little bit of Tetris. Oh, Tetris. Okay. Yes. All right. So I'll tab it there. Perfect.

57
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,460
Right there. Should do it for you. All right. Play button. I'm going to be,

58
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:39,579
I think it's the arrow keys, by the way. All right. Good. Good. Good. Number two, go ahead and

59
00:17:39,579 --> 00:17:43,819
now I can start whenever you're comfortable. You got it. All right. Starting with a little,

60
00:17:44,779 --> 00:17:50,380
a little squiggly shape, a little bit of the squiggle. All right. I'd like to see the squiggle.

61
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:55,259
Ooh, we got a little upside down tee. It can fit right there. All right. A little bit of

62
00:17:55,259 --> 00:17:59,339
shpee. A little bit of shpee. What did you say? A little bit of, a little bit of shpee. A little

63
00:17:59,339 --> 00:18:02,380
bit of shpee. You said shpee? Shpee. Oh, you said shpee. Hold on. A little bit of shpee.

64
00:18:03,339 --> 00:18:12,680
All right. And a little bit of shpee. All right. Great. And another one here.

65
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:18,119
Shpee. All right. Then we got a little. Might be a little too much. Oh, a little bit,

66
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:21,960
a little bit too much. Pull back on the shpee. Pull back on the shpee. All right. You got it.

67
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:27,640
All right. You got it. All right. A little square. I'd like to see a square.

68
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:34,970
Okay. All right. I'm killing this. I, I would watch the middle there though. You gotta be careful.

69
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:40,970
I know. I know. Get built up and then you don't know what you're gonna do. All right. Good line

70
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:44,329
clear. Good line clear there. Thank you. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. Good line clear.

71
00:18:44,329 --> 00:18:48,490
It was only one, but you know, sometimes it's all it takes. Sometimes it's all it takes. Another

72
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:54,250
line clear there. All right. So how long have you been a gamer for, number two? I've played since

73
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:59,049
1998 when I got my Nintendo 64. What was your favorite game ever made?

74
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:09,559
Favorite game ever made? Probably Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time. My favorite. No?

75
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:14,920
That's a mean answer. Oh, that's a mean answer. Give me number two. Give me number two. Number two.

76
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:21,160
Oh boy. Trying to think of my number two favorite game. Second favorite game of all time. And then,

77
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,920
by the way, you're on the clock here. Oh, okay. On the clock. Of course. Of course. That's a mean

78
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:30,519
answer and you know it. All right. I would probably say this is going to be a little

79
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:37,509
controversial. I like Journey, underrated by that game company. That's a game where you played with

80
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:40,950
another person you didn't know who they were from across the world. Yes, exactly. Yeah.

81
00:19:41,589 --> 00:19:48,549
You can work well with others. Yes. Oh, I love collab games for sure. Yes, exactly. Are you open

82
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:51,829
to collaborations with other YouTubers and streamers and stuff like that? You could get

83
00:19:51,829 --> 00:19:56,789
comfortable in those spaces. Oh yeah, absolutely. I feel like I can get along with just about

84
00:19:56,789 --> 00:20:05,140
anybody, really. Okay. If you clear this whole row, then I'm going to be very, very excited.

85
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:13,750
All right. Oh. We got two. We got two. I got to equip that one. Okay. Okay. You didn't get that

86
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:17,670
second row. I know. I know. I had a couple of missing blocks there. Oh, that was pretty good,

87
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:25,269
though, on the second theory. Good at deduction of mathematical intricacies. Absolutely.

88
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:34,950
The thing myself is something of a scientist. All right. Very, very nice. Very nice, number two.

89
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:37,990
Number two, very nice. Thank you. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. Right off the bat,

90
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:41,609
number two, very nice. Oh, thank you. I appreciate that. You know, number two,

91
00:20:41,609 --> 00:20:43,769
that's all I think I need to see. That's all you need to see? That's all I need to see.

92
00:20:43,769 --> 00:20:48,410
It's been an absolute pleasure. Absolutely. Yeah. All right. Phenomenal. Phenomenal job.

93
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:56,099
Appreciate it. Set it at number three, please. That was very good. Number three, how are you?

94
00:20:57,059 --> 00:21:01,769
Okay. What are you going to play first? Oh, you know, like a true gamer,

95
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:07,289
you're going to flip some houses. Okay. All right. Should just be able to go like this.

96
00:21:08,009 --> 00:21:13,740
All right. Right here. Controller disconnected, unfortunately. Let's see if we can get that

97
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:18,940
clicked in. Please connect the controller. It should be able to. There we go. Can you

98
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:27,609
play a continue game? Oh, you're going to have to use WASD. Oh, man. Right. Okay. Got some mouse

99
00:21:27,609 --> 00:21:31,849
action here. Here we go. Let's see if number three is real. What is this garbage? Did you put this

100
00:21:31,849 --> 00:21:36,170
here? No, House Clippers game where you clean. I'm not sure. Is that it? Is it just cleaning?

101
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:41,450
Yeah, I'm not going to say much. I have to stay back. I have to stay completely, completely out

102
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:48,700
of this. Oh, this is disgusting. Are there rats in this game? I bet there are. Why do you care

103
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:54,759
about that? Unless it's a large rat that makes all the rules. The fuck did he say? Nothing. Nothing.

104
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:59,480
Love it, bro. What is this? Can I take a sledgehammer to something? Doesn't like rats.

105
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:04,759
That's very important. Number three. I mean, Charlie Day and I, we go way back with rats.

106
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:13,079
What do I do with this? Set it places? Yeah. If you go to the, have you played House

107
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:17,160
Clipper before? I have never played this before. So if you go ahead and head to the laptop over in

108
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:23,400
the corner. I think there we go. There we go. There you go. Laptop will give you a job to do.

109
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:28,599
One of the jobs if you can. Sweet. Okay. Go ahead and do one of the jobs. Number three. I'm going to

110
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:34,200
just number three. You can do one of the jobs. Number three. Go to browser. I think. Fuck. Damn.

111
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:39,079
Yeah. Go to browser and then you can pick one of these. Oh, you can go to. How affordable.

112
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:43,240
Yeah. Pick one of the top left one. Number three, if you could please. All right. Can't afford

113
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:50,279
a number three. Okay. Go back. Oh, we got, can't afford any of these. Oh, is that the cheapest?

114
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:54,279
Wow. It's realistic. That's okay. That's pretty good. Go in the, maybe the mail.

115
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:59,240
All right. Okay. There you go. Yep. Okay. Except that job. Number three. Go ahead and get started.

116
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:03,000
All right. Let's see. He stole a radiator. He knows how to stall really well. That's pretty good.

117
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:11,160
He's got stalling in his record, but doesn't like rats. That's very important. Okay. Okay.

118
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:17,430
I wouldn't do that. No. I wouldn't do that. Number three. I wouldn't do that.

119
00:23:18,069 --> 00:23:22,150
Hey, you around like that for no reason. That's weird. Go from Tetris.

120
00:23:23,109 --> 00:23:27,029
His health just disappeared. I think you want to pivot number three. That's up to you. Go ahead.

121
00:23:27,029 --> 00:23:29,109
I wouldn't let you know. I think it might've closed on itself.

122
00:23:31,349 --> 00:23:37,430
You're playing Tetris. Wow. You're playing number twos. You're playing number twos. Game number

123
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:46,730
three. Number three. Can I get you to say just really quickly, can you say look at me? Look at

124
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:56,329
me. Look at me. Look at me right here. Uh, how do you, why does it rotate on its own? Who crafted

125
00:23:56,329 --> 00:24:02,890
this? Okay. Number three. I think I've seen enough. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. Thank you so

126
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:12,619
much. Number three. Thank you. Thank you. Number four. I like the energy. I like the energy on

127
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:19,740
that one, but I don't know. Number four. How are you? Good. Nice to meet you. Good to meet you.

128
00:24:20,299 --> 00:24:25,579
Do you want a hug? What do you want? Okay. You want a hug? I'll sit down. Now sit down. I'm

129
00:24:25,579 --> 00:24:28,619
going to sit down. Yeah. Number four is weird. I'm going to sit down. Where is the weird fucking guy?

130
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:34,460
Yeah. Yeah. I'm a weird guy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What do you want to play number four?

131
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:39,900
House Flippin'. Okay. I think House Flippin' may have crashed. Number four. So we're going to

132
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:48,460

146
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:53,880
this is actually really good to see how you are in front of, because there's an audience here as

00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:59,910
well. So make sure you don't, you're aware of that, right? Oh, you don't know you were on camera?

179
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:56,579
is this? Number five favorite game of all time. Oh, it's definitely going to be, um, it was the one

180
00:28:56,579 --> 00:29:01,380
where you beat the people up with the money and the cars. Grand Theft Auto. I love that game.

181
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:06,660
Which GTA? Oh, the one with the, the, the Roman numerals of, yeah, you're going to go in there.

182
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:10,420
You're going to actually, what are you supposed to do here? Press A. I'm pressing A. Which one?

183
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:15,619
I think number five, the one with the five. Yeah. Yeah. That's the one where you could fly around

184
00:29:15,619 --> 00:29:19,380
and do the things where you like the cops are after you and stuff. Like you go to, oh, hey,

185
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:25,460
pull that edge. Oh, don't worry. Hi, buddy. What's up? Hey, you got my money. You got my money.

186
00:29:25,779 --> 00:29:29,619
You got my fucking money. Watch out for that ledge. Number five. Watch out for that ledge.

187
00:29:29,619 --> 00:29:33,779
Yeah. Don't fall off that ledge. I don't know if it would be funny or not. Oh, it would definitely,

188
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:43,029
would definitely be funny. I'm not sure. Yes. Oh, thank God. Oh, thank God. I won, right?

189
00:29:43,029 --> 00:29:48,390
Oh, number five. I think, I don't think I need to see anymore. Okay. Well, it's been great. Um,

190
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:53,509
it's been fantastic. Thank you so much. What a pleasure. Thank you. Thank you. Go ahead and

191
00:29:53,509 --> 00:30:00,869
send in number six, please. What a classic joke that was. Absolutely classic joke. Number

192
00:30:00,869 --> 00:30:04,470
six, how are you? Good, sir. Good to see you. What are you going to be doing for us today?

193
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:08,470
Today will be dark souls. Well, good, because number five just left you out for exactly where

194
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:16,440
you need to be. Appear to be some sort of a knight. Should be an easy game. The controller

195
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:22,519
no longer functions. Number two broken. So if you use WASD on the keyboard there, you should be able

196
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:27,880
to make it. Oh, old school. Easy peasy. And the mouse too should work. Okay. I'll be careful of

197
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:31,720
that ledge. You don't want to fall off the ledge because number five, I'll be honest, number five

198
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:36,119
did the fall joke already. All right. Well, this is going to be too easy. I'm used to beating games

199
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:43,319
like broken trail. Oh shit. No, I'm fine. No, no, no, no. There you go. Actually can work under

200
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:50,230
pressure. Number six can work under pressure. I'm some sort of a paladin. This looks to be one of

201
00:30:50,309 --> 00:30:59,910
my black robes friends. I don't know why the controller is vibrating. It doesn't work. It feels

202
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:08,779
good actually against my skin. Number six. There's some sort of a technical. Oh, number six. That was

203
00:31:08,779 --> 00:31:13,480
actually a hilarious way to go. There was some sort of a technical glitch, I think. I don't think my

204
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:19,740
controller is working right. Your controller is broken. Is that what you say? Well, I mean, I am

205
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:27,559
a hardcore gamer. So what's your favorite game of all time? Oregon trail. Oh boy. That's bad.

206
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:39,930
Okay. Oh boy. Oh, this is easy. Click, click, click and slash. So number six, you like it when,

207
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:44,170
for instance, like people just get diarrhea through the whole game and you lose no matter what. Yeah,

208
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:48,490
I'm having some sort of a red diarrhea problem in this game. I don't know what that is, but it's

209
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:59,210
leaking out of my chest cavity. And I saw a wolf. To defeat my former friend. No one comes to the

210
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:10,789
boss door. Space is dodge by the way. Number six. Space is dodge. Oh, okay. Oh, you got a backstab.

211
00:32:10,789 --> 00:32:15,509
Power punch. That was actually pretty good. Yeah, he's been working out. He's been to the gym a

212
00:32:15,509 --> 00:32:23,529
couple times this week and. Number six. Destroy. Number six, I will consider this if you can get

213
00:32:23,529 --> 00:32:32,410
through the boss door. A, A, A, A, A, jump. I will consider this if you get in the boss door.

214
00:32:36,009 --> 00:32:42,089
What would A be? Meditate. A. A on the mouse and keyboard. Who knows? Does anybody know in chat?

215
00:32:42,089 --> 00:32:49,670
Anybody know? Can anybody say it? Enter, save friend to enter. Lord of the Rings. No. Do you

216
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:55,140
like Lord of the Rings? Well, of course. Okay. Now what would you, what was the last time you

217
00:32:55,140 --> 00:33:00,900
shit in your pants number six? Just about two minutes ago actually. Perfect. Right now actually.

218
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:07,299
E should be to go through the door. E. E to enter. I think you have to be standing in front of it.

219
00:33:07,299 --> 00:33:10,980
So number six is shit in your pants right now. Is that what you're saying? It's a little bit

220
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:15,640
frightening here. There we go. This is easy. Number six, if you last more than 10 seconds

221
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:25,779
of this boss, I will consider it. Okay. I just. You're just supposed to click the left

222
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:32,279
button multiple times. Thank you number six. Thank you so much. That was a pleasure.

223
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:37,240
Well, we'll be in touch. Thank you so much number six. Thank you so much number six. Appreciate it.

224
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:43,430
We'll be in touch. He did get in the boss door though. Nobody else did. Nobody else has gotten

225
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:48,390
in the tutorial box zone. Set it number seven please. Number seven. How are you? Hello, I'm good.

226
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:54,490
What are you going to be doing for us number seven? Hoping for, you got destiny two on this?

227
00:33:55,289 --> 00:34:01,160
I don't have destiny two at all. Were you playing house flipper? We'll do house flipper. Yeah.

228
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,720
Okay. I think you're going to probably have to use the keyboard and mouse. The controller is

229
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:10,840
Mad Cat's controller. No, it's a, I think it's something A. I don't know what it is. Okay.

234
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:31,690

235
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:38,090
Make it to the computer. Yeah. Like the laptop. Like this. Yeah. Just to do a job or something.

Oh, okay. Well, we're in a house right now. It seems. Turn around. Okay. Turn back around.

262
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:59,340
Okay. Left click, right click. Okay. That's like a, this is like a shield. Let's click space. Oh,

263
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:05,860
almost fell off the cliff. That's fun. Okay. Oh, you want me to go up the cliff? Oh, hello.

264
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:22,630
Uh-oh. Uh-oh. If you get a backstab here, that's huge to break. All right.

265
00:37:23,429 --> 00:37:31,429
We're going to try. Oops. Where's my sword? Did I lose it? This is very interesting.

266
00:37:31,429 --> 00:37:35,909
Okay. Oh, there we go. I can play now. Okay. Here we go. We got this. We got this. We got this.

267
00:37:35,909 --> 00:37:42,550
We're in the game. We are in the game. This is the boss, right? Yes. Okay. I got this. This is

268
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:46,789
actually one of the bosses. So if you beat this boss, that's a big. Oh, I'm going to, I'm going

269
00:37:46,789 --> 00:37:52,150
to do it. Oh wait. Oh no. Very close. I'm beating the boss. I was really close, right? That was very

270
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:57,429
close. Oh man. Do I get another try or? Yes, go for it. Oh, sweet. Awesome. Okay. I was like really

271
00:37:57,429 --> 00:38:04,710

00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:10,070
Yep. Yeah. Gross. What's your second favorite food, number eight? Uh, pizza. I mean, why not, right?

Oh, pub. Pizza, pub. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm going to get this boss. Here we go.

00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:21,989
Yeah. Just the first one. I got this. I got this. That was a good punch, right?

275
00:38:22,389 --> 00:38:27,460
Oh, here we go. Oh, no, no, no. Block it. Block it. Block it. Block it. Okay. Okay. Okay. I got this.

276
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:32,260
I got this. What's your favorite phrase? Favorite phrase is, ah, golly gee willikers. It should have

277
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:38,659
been Hakuna Matata. That's a, that's a really good one. I mean, a Disney fan at heart. Minus five points.

278
00:38:38,659 --> 00:38:42,739
I think I was like a little closer that time. It was okay. Yeah. It was all right. It was okay.

279
00:38:42,739 --> 00:38:48,250
I gave you one more try. One more try. Oh my God. Okay. I got this. I got this. Some deep breathing.

280
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:54,139
Okay. Here we go. Here we go. I'm ready. You ready? Let's do it. Yeah. Yeah.

00:38:54,139 --> 00:38:59,739
If you beat this one enemy, then, I mean, this boss, I mean. Okay. I got this. I got this.

282
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:04,139
Oh, he's up here now. Oh, this is a little confusing. Every time you set a bonfire,

283
00:39:04,139 --> 00:39:09,500
enemies respawn. They respawn. Okay. Okay. I'm coming in for it. There's a punch.

284
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:13,739
Got it. Block the shield. Oh, no. I got cut up. Okay. We're coming back in. We're coming back in.

286
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:28,219
Come on. No, no, no, no, no, no. First boss of the game. First boss of the game. I can do it.

287
00:39:29,739 --> 00:39:33,980
He got the first boss. Oh my gosh. I did it. Number eight, number eight. That's all I need to see.

288
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:38,699
He got the first boss of the game. You see, no one else got it. No one else is beating the first boss.

289
00:39:38,699 --> 00:39:43,179
Oh my gosh. Wow. That was really exciting. Thank you so much, number eight. Hey, thank you. That's

290
00:39:43,179 --> 00:39:48,619
it. We'll be in touch. Wow. Thank you. Remember, we call you, don't ever call me. Of course, yeah.

291
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:52,619
For literally any reason. I don't care if you're even in the hospital right now. Yeah, okay. Yeah,

292
00:39:52,619 --> 00:40:02,420
thanks. Wow. Number nine, please send a number nine. All right. Holy shit. Okay. Yeah, we're

293
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:11,380
ready here. Yeah, we're ready here. Okay, here we are. Oh, is... Number nine, the controller does

294
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:16,019
not work. It doesn't work. Okay. You have to use keyboard and mouse. W A S D. If you're not familiar,

295
00:40:16,019 --> 00:40:23,300
then I would choose Tetris. Okay. W A S D U P S. Okay. We also, you know what? Let's give you the

296
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:28,099
fucking sword for the love of God. Yeah, yeah. How do we give you the sword? Because somebody took

297
00:40:28,099 --> 00:40:34,260
off the fucking sword. Yeah, plug the controller in. Because you can't just play Dark Souls without a

298
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:41,079
sword on. We're going to figure this out. I feel confident that we can figure this out. I think

299
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:46,699
we got it. Do we got it? No, we got this controller. It don't work. Hey, ask chat how to go to the

300
00:40:46,699 --> 00:40:51,659
menu because there's no sword. And people just keep dying and nobody's gone to the tutorial yet.

301
00:40:53,019 --> 00:41:01,079
Is it escape? It is. Let me help you out here, number nine. Thank you. So what the fuck? Where is

302
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:07,300
it? How do you take out the other hand? How do you like swap? How come it's not on there?

303
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:12,889
Sorry about this. No, this is... We are usually incredibly professional. No, this is all right.

304
00:41:14,489 --> 00:41:18,820
It should be there. Long sword. Where is it? Somebody in chat want to help us? What's going

305
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:28,469
on here? T? E? Like how? Where is it? Right arrow key. Right arrow key. Hey, there we go. Thank you.

306
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:36,070
Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Okay. Okay. Read message. I'll read the message later. You know,

307
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:41,269
I got... Oh, no. Take the sword back out. Maybe I'm going to... Space is dodge by the way. Space is

308
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:47,690
very important in this game. Very, very important. Okay. Just going to... Okay. Hey,

309
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:53,690
hey there, buddy. Just going to... Okay. Space. Space. Yep. Can't touch me.

310
00:41:56,409 --> 00:42:03,369
They hate him. Oh, yeah. This is the brutal one. Left click is swinging the weapon.

311
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:07,659
Can't get me. Can't get me when I'm going backwards. Can you? Nope.

312
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:16,539
Nope. Nope. Nope. Oh, God. Just... Wow. Two at once. Really? This is how the day is going.

313
00:42:20,699 --> 00:42:25,340
Number nine, I've got to say, I would like to see you get through the tutorial anymore, please.

314
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:28,219
Thank you. Thank you for the... Thank you for the another chance. I appreciate it. Number nine,

315
00:42:28,219 --> 00:42:35,059
what's your favorite pasta? Favorite pasta? Linguini. Is that the right answer? Is that the

316
00:42:35,059 --> 00:42:38,900
right answer? Could be. Okay. Okay. What's your favorite game of all time, government?

317
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:46,980
Favorite game of all time? Of all time. Oh, Pokemon. Just Pokemon Red. Pokemon Red. I think

318
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:52,900
we're going OG. I really wish I could also switch up the camera angle here, but... Oh. Oh,

319
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:57,940
okay. Back to my old friend here. Hey, buddy. No, let's talk. Let's be civilized people here

320
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:02,900
and talk. Let's not use our weapons unless I'm using mine. Can I... Nope. Can't. I would use

321
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:04,980
Yeah. Yeah. No, I should use the weapon.

322
00:43:08,099 --> 00:43:13,380
Oh, we're in business now. Yeah, that's right. Thank you.

323
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:24,300
Oh, I was like, this is very... This is an intense audition. Look at you. Play the game.

324
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:26,539
Also, if you could rub your belly and pat your head, that would be great.

325
00:43:27,909 --> 00:43:33,670
If you could give me a look at me, if you could. Can you give me a look at me? Wait. Look at you?

326
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:39,269
Can you give me a look at me? Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Look at

327
00:43:39,269 --> 00:43:42,389
me. All right. I've seen it on number nine. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. Thank you.

328
00:43:42,389 --> 00:43:47,110
That was fantastic. And when I said it on number 10, it was... Don't get your butt kicked from the

329
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:51,110
door. They can hurt you. Number 10, how are you? I'm number 10. I'm great. What are you going to

330
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:55,190
be doing for us on number 10? Oh, I'm doing some Dark Souls. Yeah. Everybody's... Let me ask you

331
00:43:56,150 --> 00:44:01,510
do you... Can you get through the tutorial boss's door? Oh, yeah. I mean, listen. So long as I don't

332
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:06,309
have a sword, I'm going to be doing just fabulous workout here. Absolutely. Anyone know how I can

333
00:44:06,309 --> 00:44:13,989
get the sword? Right on the right arrow key. Oh. On the keyboard right arrow key. Oh, let's go, baby.

334
00:44:13,989 --> 00:44:18,869
Space is dodge, by the way. Make sure that... Oh, yeah. Space is very important. This game is all

335
00:44:18,869 --> 00:44:26,150
about watching these. Oh, oh, okay. Yeah. All right. Everybody picked Dark Souls. Oh, let's go,

337
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:36,869
if you get the first boss right now, it would be $1,000. Oh my God. Let's go. I need that rent

338
00:44:36,869 --> 00:44:46,090
money, baby. Let's go. Oh, shit. Oh, yeah. Let's... Nope. Yes. Number 10, if you actually go into

339
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:49,610
this door with E and get the first boss, that would be $1,000. All right. I'm in it. I'm in it

340
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:52,809
to win it. I'm in it for the thousand. Let's go, baby. Come here. Come here. Give it to me. Nope.

341
00:44:53,769 --> 00:45:01,449
Absolutely not. Let's go. Give it to me. Press E. What is drink Estus? Can we get... Can somebody

342
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:06,809
chat? Oh, I do need that Estus. Cause he's really going to... That index thunder is actually the

343
00:45:06,809 --> 00:45:15,050
first boss. It's very, very scary. Oh, yeah. It's a big boy. Whoa. Give it to him. Give it to him.

344
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:19,530
Okay. All right. Just... This is a war of attrition here. Come on, Gunder. Let's go, Grandle.

345
00:45:23,269 --> 00:45:30,139
Press R. It's all right. It's all right. That was very good. Number 10, can I get a look at me,

346
00:45:30,139 --> 00:45:34,619
please? Yeah. Oh, look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me right here. Look at me. Perfect.

347
00:45:34,619 --> 00:45:37,420
Perfect. Thank you. That's all we need to see. We'll be in touch really... Thank you very much.

348
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:41,260
Appreciate it. Thank you, number 10. Really appreciate that. Send in number 11. Oh, number 11?

349
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:49,210
Number 11? Can you come in for a second here? Hey. How are you, number 11? Good. How are you?

350
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:52,650
What are you going to do for us today, number 11? I'm going to try that Dark Souls.

351
00:45:55,449 --> 00:46:03,699
Unless you'd rather something else. No, please play Dark Souls. Please play it. Okay. Number 11.

352
00:46:03,699 --> 00:46:09,300
I need to be very clear. Number 11. Dark Souls. Nobody's gone through the tutorial door.

353
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:14,019
Can you make it through the tutorial boss's door and beat the tutorial boss in Dark Souls 3?

354
00:46:14,019 --> 00:46:17,139
You know what? I'm definitely going to try. What's your favorite pasta?

355
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:24,900
Like the noodle or all of it combined? Everything. I like rigatoni marinara,

356
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:28,579
bolognese. Rigatoni bolognese. Okay. That's a good answer. Yeah. It's my favorite.

357
00:46:29,539 --> 00:46:32,820
Number 11, did you ever shit your pants? Of course. When was the last time?

358
00:46:35,699 --> 00:46:40,250
Just before I got in here. Sorry. I didn't want to admit it. Very good answer, actually.

359
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:45,289
Go ahead. It's keyboard and mouse. W-A-S-D is to move. Left click is to swim your sword,

360
00:46:45,289 --> 00:46:49,769
and space is to dodge. If you could take up that controller there right now, if you could.

361
00:46:49,769 --> 00:46:51,769
Just control it down here? Well, the controller's broken,

362
00:46:51,769 --> 00:46:57,530
but the keyboard and mouse, you do W-A-S-D to move. W-A-S-D to move?

363
00:46:57,530 --> 00:46:59,690
Number two broke the controller, and we're very upset about it.

364
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:04,329
Damn it. Number two. Oh my god. Fuck me.

365
00:47:04,329 --> 00:47:11,670
So if you hit W-A-S-D. I get it. I get it. Yeah, it's move.

366
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:15,429
If you hold W-A-S-D, hold W will get you to where you need to be.

367
00:47:15,429 --> 00:47:18,550
Oh, great. Okay, I'm going to just go down here, I suppose.

368
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:22,070
Yeah. Oh, you didn't tell me what the attacks are.

369
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:26,070
Left click is attack, and space is dodge. Did I kill him?

370
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:30,070
You did. Fuck yeah. Okay, I guess I'm going this way.

371
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:32,789
Number 11, say shpee for me, please. Shpee.

372
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:35,429
Again? Shpee.

373
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:44,380
What is happening? You guys want to kill?

374
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:47,980
That's good. Wow, maybe I will get through that door.

375
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:52,940
That's the door right there. When you get up to that door, you press E, you'll fight the boss.

376
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:55,980
R is drink potion to heal. Very important.

377
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:59,179
R is drink potion to heal? Oh, shit.

378
00:48:02,789 --> 00:48:06,230
Make sure you get rid of that guy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just got to face him,

379
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:09,210
you know? Careful, careful. You got it.

380
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:11,849
You got it, you got it. You said R?

381
00:48:11,849 --> 00:48:14,570
I'm healed. Where's my health? Oh, right there.

382
00:48:14,570 --> 00:48:15,530
Cool. Top left corner.

383
00:48:15,929 --> 00:48:19,769
You ever play Dark Souls before, number 11? No, but I used to play Crash Bandicoot,

384
00:48:19,769 --> 00:48:22,969
and we would call that Dark Souls because that game is hard as hell too.

385
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:27,929
Good answer. You ever play Crash Bandicoot?

386
00:48:27,929 --> 00:48:29,449
I have. That game is ridiculous.

387
00:48:30,489 --> 00:48:40,119
All right, here's this bastard. Yeah, I'd definitely say so.

388
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:50,389
Number 11, thank you so much for your time. Yeah, thank you.

389
00:48:50,389 --> 00:48:53,670
We appreciate it. Thank you so much. You can send it in the next one when you get out there.

390
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:56,550
Absolutely. Thank you so much, number 11.

391
00:48:56,550 --> 00:48:58,869
Big Crash Bandicoot fan. Big Crash Bandicoot fan.

392
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:02,230
Love it. Hi.

393
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:03,829
Well, how are you? Good.

394
00:49:03,829 --> 00:49:04,550
How are you? Good to see you.

395
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:08,630
Do you have ready to give us a little bit of a show here? I don't know if you want to play?

396
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:11,590
What can I play? You got it.

397
00:49:12,789 --> 00:49:14,789
Do you want to play Dark Souls? No.

398
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:18,150
Okay. We've got Tetris. That sounds scary.

399
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:21,110
We've got Tetris, and we have also House Flipper.

400
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:25,670
Well, I will try Tetris. Tetris, all right.

401
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:27,829
We've got a Tetris player here. What is Tetris?

402
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:32,389
You're asking what Tetris is. Yeah.

403
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:37,190
I don't know what any of these games are, but Tetris sounded cool.

404
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:40,150
You don't even know what Tetris is?

405
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:43,719
Thanks a lot for coming, number 12. I appreciate it.

406
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:47,400
See, we'll be in touch. We'll be in touch. Thank you so much for your time.

407
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,079
You sure? Yeah, yeah, that's fine.

408
00:49:49,079 --> 00:49:52,039
You don't even know. You don't even go home. You don't know what Tetris is.

409
00:49:52,039 --> 00:49:53,719
No. Do you know who Super Mario is?

410
00:49:53,719 --> 00:49:56,780
Yes. Have a nice night.

411
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:59,820
Thank you so much. I appreciate it. Number 12, that was really fantastic.

412
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:01,260
Thank you so much. Thank you.

413
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:02,940
Number 13 can come on in, please.

414
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:07,019
How do you know what Tetris is? Number 13, how are you?

415
00:50:07,019 --> 00:50:08,539
Good, good, good. Thank you.

416
00:50:08,539 --> 00:50:10,059
Good to see you. What are you going to do for us?

417
00:50:10,059 --> 00:50:14,139
Good to be here. Well, I am going to do Tetris.

418
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:16,699
Do you know what it is? I do.

419
00:50:16,699 --> 00:50:19,340
Okay, great. You press the okay button here.

420
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:21,179
You can put in whatever initials you want. It doesn't really matter.

421
00:50:22,469 --> 00:50:25,269
It's just like a random website. That's fine.

422
00:50:25,989 --> 00:50:27,829
I just hit the restart button right in the middle there.

423
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:31,510
So you got the arrow keys, it should be, to move the Tetris pieces around.

424
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:35,030
And then flip them around and down is to make it go down.

425
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:37,989
And number 13, I'd like to go right up to that.

426
00:50:37,989 --> 00:50:39,190
What's your favorite sound is?

427
00:50:43,079 --> 00:50:44,519
How do you flip it again?

428
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:46,599
It should be the right and left arrow keys.

429
00:50:46,599 --> 00:50:48,280
The right and space. Space.

430
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:52,599
Oh, okay. That one's garbage, but the next one will be better.

431
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:58,360
All right. Let's see if I can hit this down and then slide it across right now.

432
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:02,679
Yeah, that's the ticket. We're hit to be square here.

433
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:11,480
So Tetris is really fun because it was invented in the 1600s in Russia

434
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:15,719
and people would play with nothing but sticks and vodka.

435
00:51:17,429 --> 00:51:19,429
And here we are all these years later playing.

436
00:51:22,489 --> 00:51:25,929
Interesting story. Is that the way?

437
00:51:25,929 --> 00:51:28,809
That's history. That's history.

438
00:51:28,809 --> 00:51:35,210
Yeah. Vladimir Tetrisnov invented it and they used to play with rocks and sticks

439
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:36,730
and they would try to fit it.

440
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:39,769
And apparently they would build whole villages this way.

441
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:44,889
And that's why Russia is such a messed up place now.

442
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:50,039
Number 13, can I get a hug of England?

443
00:51:50,039 --> 00:51:55,239
There's other reasons too. Economics, pop, but mostly I blame Tetris.

444
00:51:55,239 --> 00:51:59,480
So Tetris was invented, I did not know that. That's a lore conversation.

445
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:05,159
Oh, you remember the theme song, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

446
00:52:05,159 --> 00:52:07,559
You know, you know that's vodka right there.

447
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:09,639
You gonna get a good clear here in number 13?

448
00:52:09,639 --> 00:52:10,440
A good clear?

449
00:52:10,599 --> 00:52:12,119
I gotta get a clear? Boy, clear.

450
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:18,380
Well, I think you're asking a lot for the first time, but I'll try to impress you.

451
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:20,940
Oh, it was one line though.

452
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:26,539
Well, we all gotta start somewhere. All gotta start somewhere.

453
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:33,179
Oh, you got actually. All right. Bingo, bingo, bingo, bingo. Very nice number 13.

454
00:52:33,179 --> 00:52:38,139
I spent a lot of summers playing on my Game Boy. I didn't have a lot of friends.

455
00:52:38,699 --> 00:52:41,099
Now I have two friends, but back then I didn't have any.

456
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:47,719
You always got to one up me, huh?

457
00:52:48,679 --> 00:52:53,210
You're trying to be me. Don't forget that. Can I get a look at me, please?

458
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:06,889
Can I get a look? Can I get you to say, look at me?

459
00:53:07,610 --> 00:53:09,530
Look at me. Again?

460
00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:13,210
Look at me. Number 13, that's all I need to see. Thank you so much. Number 13.

461
00:53:13,210 --> 00:53:16,329
Thank you. Next time.

462
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:21,210
Excellent. Excellent. Wait till the door closes and we talk about it.

463
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:25,619
Donnie, when you're out, we talk about you after the door closes.

464
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:27,300
Oh, I thought you wanted to talk about me now.

465
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:29,139
No, no. When the door closes, we talk about you.

466
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:30,980
You're gonna have my ear pressed to the door.

467
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:31,860
I hope you don't do that.

468
00:53:38,309 --> 00:53:40,389
Number 14, please send in number 14.

469
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:42,730
That's no.

470
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:44,170
Hey, get in here.

471
00:53:44,170 --> 00:53:45,690
No, you're 14. You're 14. Come on.

472
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:46,090
I know.

473
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:46,889
How are you 14?

474
00:53:46,889 --> 00:53:47,530
Nice to meet you.

475
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:50,489
Nice to meet you 14. We have Tetris here for you.

476
00:53:50,489 --> 00:53:53,210
We might have to restart it, but what were you going to play for us?

477
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:55,369
I mean, I love Tetris. I was going to do House Flipper.

478
00:53:55,929 --> 00:53:59,369
Do you know how to play House Flipper? Or do you know how to play Tetris?

479
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:00,250
Which is better for you?

480
00:54:00,809 --> 00:54:02,090
Looks like we're going with Tetris.

481
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:04,170
Can you salvage this?

482
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:05,289
Salvage this game right now?

483
00:54:05,289 --> 00:54:08,809
If you salvage this game, number 14, that is a monumental deal.

484
00:54:08,809 --> 00:54:10,010
Well, look at where they left me.

485
00:54:10,969 --> 00:54:11,210
Just...

486
00:54:11,849 --> 00:54:14,570
By the way, number 14, did you know that the Russians played this?

487
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,250
The Russians played this.

488
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:16,750
Apparently.

489
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:18,730
Really?

490
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:20,409
Yeah. If you can salvage this, that's a huge deal.

491
00:54:20,409 --> 00:54:24,969
Number 14, what's your favorite ride at Disney World?

492
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:29,780
I'd have to say it's a small world.

493
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:30,280
Wrong.

494
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:31,300
Correct.

495
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:31,940
Try again.

496
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:34,420
Okay. The Pirate of the Caribbean ride.

497
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:34,980
Good.

498
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,949
Thank you. All right.

499
00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:40,170
Ah!

500
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:41,449
Not bad.

501
00:54:41,449 --> 00:54:42,570
A salvage.

502
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:45,449
Pretty good salvage actually. You can use the keys too if it helps you.

503
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:48,940
I can. Which keys?

504
00:54:49,579 --> 00:54:51,340
Should be the left and right arrow keys.

505
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:55,130
Oh, yes.

506
00:54:55,929 --> 00:54:56,429
Not bad.

507
00:54:57,050 --> 00:54:58,170
Under pressure as well.

508
00:54:58,170 --> 00:54:59,690
This is huge under pressure.

509
00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:01,210
I was thrown into a game.

510
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:03,449
I feel like this is what happens to people.

511
00:55:03,449 --> 00:55:05,130
14, what's your favorite emote on Switch?

512
00:55:05,769 --> 00:55:06,650
My favorite emote?

513
00:55:07,690 --> 00:55:08,489
I'd have to say...

514
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:10,510
MonkaS.

515
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:12,809
Okay.

516
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:13,610
Thank you.

517
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:15,320
Game over.

518
00:55:15,699 --> 00:55:16,980
Game over. Did you lose?

519
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,179
Try one more. Try one more.

520
00:55:18,179 --> 00:55:19,780
I'll give you one more attempt because you knew it was a game.

521
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:20,280
Okay.

522
00:55:22,329 --> 00:55:24,730
If you were to use MonkaS in a sentence, how would you use it?

523
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:26,329
I would say...

524
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:32,250
I got put in the middle of a Tetris game of someone else and I failed.

525
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:33,610
So that makes me want to go...

526
00:55:33,610 --> 00:55:34,110
MonkaS.

527
00:55:35,449 --> 00:55:36,760
Thank you.

528
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:37,260
Very nice.

529
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:38,360
Thank you.

530
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:40,510
Very nice.

531
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,630
Here we go.

532
00:55:46,630 --> 00:55:49,510
By the way, I never played Tetris on my screen one time.

533
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:52,760
I think the game sucks. I think it's a stupid fucking child's game.

534
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,760
Well, that's why I think I should have done House Flipper.

535
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:55,260
Yeah.

536
00:55:55,559 --> 00:55:59,059
I think it's a stupid game for unintelligent people.

537
00:56:00,619 --> 00:56:01,739
Intelligent people play...

538
00:56:01,739 --> 00:56:03,980
That must have been number 13, Joyce, so...

539
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:08,280
Actually, you're doing actually a pretty good build up on number 14.

540
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:09,559
You think so?

541
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:14,300
Oh, shit.

542
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:16,699
Oh, shoot. Number 14.

543
00:56:16,699 --> 00:56:17,739
Somebody help me.

544
00:56:17,739 --> 00:56:19,179
Oh, number 14.

545
00:56:19,179 --> 00:56:21,130
Okay. Thank you so much, Green.

546
00:56:21,130 --> 00:56:23,449
I'm going to have to cancel you out there.

547
00:56:23,449 --> 00:56:24,010
I'm sorry.

548
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:25,130
Close you out there, number 14.

549
00:56:25,130 --> 00:56:26,250
Thank you so much for coming.

550
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:26,809
Thank you.

551
00:56:26,809 --> 00:56:27,929
Please send in number 15.

552
00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:33,239
15, how are you?

553
00:56:33,239 --> 00:56:34,360
I'm great. How are you?

554
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:35,000
Good to see you, 15.

555
00:56:36,119 --> 00:56:37,480
All right. What are we doing?

556
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:38,199
What do you want to play for us?

557
00:56:38,199 --> 00:56:40,679
We got Dark Souls, House Flipper, and Tetris.

558
00:56:40,679 --> 00:56:42,440
Let's play some Tetris.

559
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,400
All right. You want to go Tetris?

560
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:43,960
Yeah.

561
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:44,920
You got a game going right now.

562
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:47,400
All right. Oh, but who was this person?

563
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,079
They didn't... I didn't do this.

564
00:56:49,079 --> 00:56:50,039
This is not me.

565
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:51,079
Under Pressure was even here.

566
00:56:51,079 --> 00:56:53,320
Oh, that's a great song.

567
00:56:54,039 --> 00:56:54,760
It is.

568
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:58,360
Yeah. I like these pieces because they're small and compact like me.

569
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:02,630
Oh, how do I... Oh, yeah, okay.

570
00:57:02,630 --> 00:57:03,269
Where do I go?

571
00:57:03,269 --> 00:57:05,510
Oh, and the colors.

572
00:57:05,510 --> 00:57:06,710
Oh, all the colors.

573
00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:07,210
Yeah.

574
00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:11,079
Okay, there we go.

575
00:57:11,079 --> 00:57:11,960
Look at that.

576
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:13,400
You see that?

577
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,019
I wonder if you're clear.

578
00:57:15,019 --> 00:57:17,099
Oh, I'll clear the line.

579
00:57:17,659 --> 00:57:19,739
I'll clear it all the way down the line.

580
00:57:19,739 --> 00:57:24,039
Oh, they're cooking with the gas right now.

581
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,679
Oh, I am prepared.

582
00:57:28,679 --> 00:57:30,519
I was up all night.

583
00:57:30,519 --> 00:57:32,280
Just me and some jilt cola, baby.

584
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:36,110
Oh, look at this. Look at this.

585
00:57:36,110 --> 00:57:38,110
I'm building a tower of love.

586
00:57:40,110 --> 00:57:47,070
Let's see how the pressure's on now.

587
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:48,909
Careful here, number 15.

588
00:57:49,309 --> 00:57:50,750
I know. I know.

589
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:52,030
You're getting close.

590
00:57:52,030 --> 00:57:55,230
No, but I was creating sort of a mosaic.

591
00:57:55,869 --> 00:57:56,989
You know, a mosaic.

592
00:57:57,869 --> 00:57:59,389
You can restart it. I want to see one more.

593
00:57:59,389 --> 00:58:00,429
Okay. All right.

594
00:58:00,429 --> 00:58:02,750
How do I turn these things anyway?

595
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:05,630
So you should be using the left and right arrow keys you're doing.

596
00:58:05,630 --> 00:58:07,070
The knobs might be a little bit trickier for you.

597
00:58:07,070 --> 00:58:07,789
Oh, I see.

598
00:58:10,679 --> 00:58:13,320
Oh, I see. I see. Okay.

599
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:16,599
And then I'm going to nestle this guy in here.

600
00:58:16,599 --> 00:58:18,440
I'm just going to hug him gently.

601
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:21,639
You see that? You see that?

602
00:58:21,639 --> 00:58:22,519
That was very nice.

603
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:24,599
Thank you.

604
00:58:25,639 --> 00:58:26,360
Very impressed.

605
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:30,360
Yeah. See, the original Game Boy was loaded with this.

606
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:31,480
Did you have a Game Boy?

607
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:33,000
I did. I won.

608
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,559
The only game I ever beat was DuckTales.

609
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:37,320
That's a great game.

610
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:38,119
It is a great game.

611
00:58:38,119 --> 00:58:39,320
You've played one now on NES.

612
00:58:40,199 --> 00:58:44,199
No, I wasn't allowed to have that because my parents don't love me.

613
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:48,969
I had to play it over at friends' homes.

614
00:58:48,969 --> 00:58:51,500
I had to play it over there.

615
00:58:51,739 --> 00:58:53,739
That's also where I got sugared cereal.

616
00:58:54,619 --> 00:58:57,500
Nothing but bran flakes and grape nuts at my place.

617
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:00,320
Very interesting backstory.

618
00:59:02,159 --> 00:59:03,769
It's a little bit of a bio there.

619
00:59:09,519 --> 00:59:10,400
Hold on. I got to do this.

620
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:12,079
It feels so good.

621
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:12,960
Oh, wait. I got to do this.

622
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:13,440
Get the other one too.

623
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:14,000
Yeah, I got to do this.

624
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:14,639
It feels so good.

625
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:19,519
15. That's all I need to see.

626
00:59:19,519 --> 00:59:20,159
Okay. All right.

627
00:59:20,719 --> 00:59:22,320
Absolutely phenomenal job, by the way.

628
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:23,440
Brought a change of pants.

629
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:24,320
Thank God. All right.

630
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,239
Everybody shook their pants before they got here?

631
00:59:26,239 --> 00:59:27,039
Is that a requirement?

632
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:30,679
Number 16.

633
00:59:31,239 --> 00:59:32,760
You didn't think we had more than 10 people?

634
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:34,679
16, how are you?

635
00:59:34,679 --> 00:59:35,880
Hi, good. How are you?

636
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:37,000
Good. I'm doing fantastic.

637
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:37,639
Nice to meet you.

638
00:59:37,639 --> 00:59:38,519
Nice to meet you too.

639
00:59:38,519 --> 00:59:39,960
I'm very, very happy to meet you.

640
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:42,920
We already have Tetris going, but there's also other options

641
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:44,199
if you'd like to give us something.

642
00:59:44,199 --> 00:59:45,800
Cool. Could I play Dark Souls?

643
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:46,519
You absolutely could.

644
00:59:46,519 --> 00:59:47,480
We have all tablets.

645
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:48,679
The controller is broken.

646
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:49,639
Unfortunate.

647
00:59:49,639 --> 00:59:50,679
So you have to keyboard and mouse.

648
00:59:50,679 --> 00:59:52,280
WASD, left click, right click.

649
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:55,159
R is Estus and space is dodge.

650
00:59:55,159 --> 00:59:55,800
What's Perry?

651
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:58,360
Perry, good fucking question.

652
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:02,119
What if number 16, you're the first person to ask that question.

653
01:00:02,119 --> 01:00:03,719
So we're going to go ahead and write that down.

654
01:00:03,719 --> 01:00:04,280
Okay.

655
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:06,840
First of all, number 16, 17, no, it's 16 people,

656
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:09,000
probably nine people picked Dark Souls for some reason.

657
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:09,559
Okay, that's a lot.

658
01:00:09,559 --> 01:00:11,239
And none of them have, I think,

659
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:14,199
the computer is held by about 10 percent.

660
01:00:14,199 --> 01:00:15,639
So just to know that.

661
01:00:15,639 --> 01:00:15,960
Okay.

662
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:19,239
I'm just going to give you a different dark soul if you're worried about that.

663
01:00:19,239 --> 01:00:19,719
Okay, okay.

664
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:22,269
Tab to Perry?

665
01:00:22,269 --> 01:00:22,590
Okay.

666
01:00:22,590 --> 01:00:23,789
It's tab is Perry, okay.

667
01:00:23,789 --> 01:00:24,989
That's what Chad says.

668
01:00:24,989 --> 01:00:25,949
Oh, okay, watch.

669
01:00:25,949 --> 01:00:27,230
Shift, someone says shift.

670
01:00:27,230 --> 01:00:27,469
Shift.

671
01:00:27,469 --> 01:00:28,269
Is shift Perry?

672
01:00:29,309 --> 01:00:29,949
Ah, control.

673
01:00:29,949 --> 01:00:30,829
Okay, it's control.

674
01:00:30,829 --> 01:00:31,389
Okay, we're good.

675
01:00:31,389 --> 01:00:31,949
We're starting, okay.

676
01:00:32,909 --> 01:00:33,389
Go for it.

677
01:00:34,510 --> 01:00:36,829
All right, let's play some Dark Souls here.

678
01:00:38,170 --> 01:00:41,210
Get ourselves some, excuse me, sir.

679
01:00:41,210 --> 01:00:47,769
I'm trying to complete something here if you'll kindly back off of me.

680
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:48,090
Thank you.

681
01:00:48,090 --> 01:00:50,170
Number 16, what's the accent you're doing?

682
01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:53,610
Oh, well, I figured, you know, this is the new German, right?

683
01:00:53,610 --> 01:00:53,849
Yeah.

684
01:00:53,849 --> 01:00:56,489
Well, why would we want the same old cookie cutter German

685
01:00:56,489 --> 01:00:57,849
when we could have a new German?

686
01:00:57,849 --> 01:01:02,489
You know, I think maybe new German could like be like a cowboy and have like a beard.

687
01:01:02,489 --> 01:01:05,210
So, you know, like we want to constantly be improving.

688
01:01:05,210 --> 01:01:05,449
Right.

689
01:01:05,449 --> 01:01:08,809
So, you know, that's why I think we should kind of keep it going

690
01:01:08,809 --> 01:01:11,369
but constantly strive to do better.

691
01:01:11,369 --> 01:01:14,329
Okay, I guess I follow you on that a little bit here.

692
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:16,250
Are you willing to shave the beard?

693
01:01:18,239 --> 01:01:20,000
Well, that's a difficult question.

694
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,599
I guess it depends on if it's worth it, but I suppose I could part with it.

695
01:01:24,159 --> 01:01:27,360
And you're okay with a 5% royalties on the screen

696
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:28,559
and 95% going through?

697
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:32,059
Yeah, I suppose, given the numbers.

698
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:34,190
They're huge, by the way.

699
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:35,630
Yeah, that's what I want to figure.

700
01:01:36,349 --> 01:01:39,360
Just making sure we get that correct before we sign anything for anybody.

701
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,679
It should be E to go through.

702
01:01:41,679 --> 01:01:42,880
Oh, I see, okay.

703
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,199
You could be champion Grunder and you're the first to do that.

704
01:01:47,199 --> 01:01:48,960
Let's give it a big old college try.

705
01:01:49,519 --> 01:01:49,920
Good try.

706
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:50,400
Let's see what you got.

707
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:56,329
So, not to give you anything to think about why you're doing this,

708
01:01:56,329 --> 01:01:59,769
but number 16, what would you say is your favorite ride at Disney win?

709
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:01,130
That's a tough one.

710
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:04,409
I'd say Big Thunder Mountain if I had to give it the old guess.

711
01:02:04,409 --> 01:02:06,329
Staying with the country person.

712
01:02:06,329 --> 01:02:08,809
Well, that's me and the country person thing.

713
01:02:09,769 --> 01:02:11,710
Dude, we're going to lean into that, okay?

714
01:02:11,710 --> 01:02:14,110
What's your favorite food?

715
01:02:15,389 --> 01:02:17,070
I'd say chicken fried steak.

716
01:02:19,389 --> 01:02:21,630
Listen, I don't break character ever.

717
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:22,590
You better believe me.

718
01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:25,949
Okay, I'm going to look at these books.

719
01:02:25,949 --> 01:02:26,449
Yeah.

720
01:02:31,550 --> 01:02:35,070
Number 16, can I just say, look at me loudly and put your hands in your mouth?

721
01:02:35,070 --> 01:02:35,550
Look at me.

722
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:37,469
Look at me.

723
01:02:37,469 --> 01:02:38,349
Oh, hold on.

724
01:02:38,349 --> 01:02:39,550
I've got a good master's here.

725
01:02:40,510 --> 01:02:41,630
Is it good for your health?

726
01:02:47,550 --> 01:02:48,190
Holy shit.

727
01:02:48,190 --> 01:02:49,550
Are you going to beat Gundyr?

728
01:02:49,550 --> 01:02:50,590
I mean, it's Gundyr.

729
01:02:50,590 --> 01:02:51,389
It's not that hard.

730
01:02:52,190 --> 01:02:52,829
Wow.

731
01:02:52,829 --> 01:02:53,789
Number 16.

732
01:02:54,510 --> 01:02:55,550
Number 16.

733
01:03:00,429 --> 01:03:01,309
All right, Gigi.

734
01:03:01,309 --> 01:03:02,190
You just beat Gundyr.

735
01:03:02,909 --> 01:03:03,710
You just did it.

736
01:03:03,710 --> 01:03:04,829
You just beat Gundyr.

737
01:03:04,829 --> 01:03:06,110
No, it's even gone through the door.

738
01:03:06,110 --> 01:03:08,349
I usually play on key on controller.

739
01:03:08,349 --> 01:03:09,869
I don't know if that's a problem.

740
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:11,309
Number 16, that was phenomenal.

741
01:03:11,309 --> 01:03:13,309
I just have to be very, I got to make sure you really wear this.

742
01:03:14,110 --> 01:03:14,989
That beard though.

743
01:03:15,789 --> 01:03:17,710
Is that just, that's, you just got to go.

744
01:03:18,429 --> 01:03:20,170
That beard has to go.

745
01:03:20,170 --> 01:03:21,050
Okay.

746
01:03:21,050 --> 01:03:23,690
Well, sometimes we got to make sacrifices.

747
01:03:24,650 --> 01:03:25,289
Thank you so much.

748
01:03:25,289 --> 01:03:26,010
That was fantastic.

749
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:26,570
Number 16.

750
01:03:26,570 --> 01:03:27,530
You can send it number 17.

751
01:03:27,530 --> 01:03:29,210
I'm sure that was phenomenal.

752
01:03:29,210 --> 01:03:30,489
Y'all come back now here.

753
01:03:31,289 --> 01:03:33,050
I don't know why you keep doing this country thing.

754
01:03:33,050 --> 01:03:34,250
It doesn't make sense to me.

755
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:36,969
Because I'm literally from the East Coast, from like Boston.

756
01:03:36,969 --> 01:03:38,090
Like I could see like in New York.

757
01:03:39,130 --> 01:03:40,329
Send number 17, please.

758
01:03:40,329 --> 01:03:42,010
And that should round us out.

759
01:03:42,730 --> 01:03:43,449
Number 17.

760
01:03:44,489 --> 01:03:48,800
Do we not have 17?

761
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:49,599
17 is not here.

762
01:03:52,519 --> 01:03:53,880
Number 17 is not here.

763
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:55,320
We have number 16 is there.

764
01:03:57,389 --> 01:03:58,190
Okay.

765
01:03:58,190 --> 01:04:00,489
That's the best we got.

766
01:04:01,210 --> 01:04:03,710
That's what we got.

767
01:04:03,710 --> 01:04:05,869
I mean, it was never classified in the country.

768
01:04:05,869 --> 01:04:07,070
And all the newspapers in the country.

769
01:04:09,050 --> 01:04:09,530
Okay.

770
01:04:09,530 --> 01:04:12,250
I, this is going to take a little bit of deliberation here.

771
01:04:13,789 --> 01:04:14,829
I have no fucking idea.

772
01:04:16,829 --> 01:04:20,110
I'm, give me, I don't know if I'm addressing this camera here.

773
01:04:20,110 --> 01:04:21,630
But like, give me a few minutes.

774
01:04:22,269 --> 01:04:23,789
I need to think about what I'm going to do about this.

775
01:04:24,590 --> 01:04:30,219
Because there are 16, there are 16 people here that I mean, I don't know.

776
01:04:30,219 --> 01:04:31,019
I have no idea.

777
01:04:31,019 --> 01:04:31,820
I'm going to need a few minutes.

778
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:32,699
Give us a few minutes.

779
01:04:32,699 --> 01:04:34,780
Let me deliberate on this and think about what I want to do here.

780
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:38,059
And we'll be right back in just a few minutes.

781
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:51,210
Phone of friends.

782
01:25:51,210 --> 01:25:54,880
So this is harder than I thought it was going to be, unfortunately.

783
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:56,399
I knew it was going to be hard.

784
01:25:56,640 --> 01:26:03,180
But trying to eliminate people is not my, my forefront.

785
01:26:03,899 --> 01:26:05,260
But I will do my best.

786
01:26:06,140 --> 01:26:10,810
I'm going to have to say I've spent 10, 20 minutes sitting here trying to figure out

787
01:26:10,810 --> 01:26:11,609
what I want to do here.

788
01:26:12,409 --> 01:26:13,710
I'm going to have to cut.

789
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:17,479
I mean, number, I mean, number seven, Connor.

790
01:26:18,439 --> 01:26:19,079
What are you doing here?

791
01:26:19,079 --> 01:26:19,800
Connor Reid's pants.

792
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:23,079
You've got, you have a career going for yourself for the love of God.

793
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:24,760
You're a young guy.

794
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:26,359
You've got a great career in front of you.

795
01:26:26,359 --> 01:26:27,239
You don't, you don't got to be me.

796
01:26:27,239 --> 01:26:27,880
Be you.

797
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:29,640
And you, you're doing you very well.

798
01:26:31,050 --> 01:26:34,649
Also, I mean, the number 12 didn't know how to play Tetris.

799
01:26:35,850 --> 01:26:36,810
Just get out of here.

800
01:26:36,810 --> 01:26:38,489
I mean, what, what are we going to do with you?

801
01:26:39,529 --> 01:26:43,760
And then probably at the same time, I mean, number 16 as well.

802
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:45,760
We actually talked backstage.

803
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:48,079
He didn't want to shave his beard once and for all.

804
01:26:48,079 --> 01:26:52,880
So I was like, I mean, if you're not going to shave how he, yeah.

805
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:54,079
Oh, country German.

806
01:26:54,079 --> 01:26:55,119
That's not going to happen, man.

807
01:26:56,319 --> 01:26:58,319
That's all I could come up with so far.

808
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:00,800
I sat for 10, 20 minutes.

809
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:01,600
Remember, this is me.

810
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:03,050
This is my shit.

811
01:27:03,050 --> 01:27:05,039
This is my channel.

812
01:27:05,039 --> 01:27:06,720
I have to be sure of this stuff.

813
01:27:07,869 --> 01:27:10,430
So what's going to have to happen here over the next,

814
01:27:11,229 --> 01:27:12,350
I don't know how long it's going to take,

815
01:27:12,350 --> 01:27:16,909
but I've employed a few people to try to really narrow down

816
01:27:16,909 --> 01:27:19,390
who I think could be the next German 985.

817
01:27:20,939 --> 01:27:22,140
I need some help.

818
01:27:22,140 --> 01:27:23,899
I need some more context.

819
01:27:24,779 --> 01:27:26,779
So let's go ahead and start episode one,

820
01:27:26,779 --> 01:27:29,899
season one, episode one, final pilot one,

821
01:27:29,899 --> 01:27:34,010
end of the series one, final episode one

822
01:27:34,010 --> 01:27:39,630
of Who Will Replace Me on German 985.

823
01:27:40,430 --> 01:27:53,529
Hello. How are you?

824
01:27:53,529 --> 01:27:58,409
Welcome to Who Will Replace Me on German 985.

825
01:27:58,409 --> 01:27:59,529
I'm German 985.

826
01:27:59,529 --> 01:28:00,409
Welcome. How are you?

827
01:28:01,050 --> 01:28:02,810
I figured this would be probably hard to do.

828
01:28:03,529 --> 01:28:05,130
So I have employed a few people,

829
01:28:05,689 --> 01:28:07,449
at least a handful of people to help me do this.

830
01:28:08,170 --> 01:28:10,649
And we'll go one by one to find out

831
01:28:10,649 --> 01:28:13,949
who could help me decide who could replace me.

832
01:28:13,949 --> 01:28:15,310
So we'll go back over here.

833
01:28:15,310 --> 01:28:16,109
We have Ster here.

834
01:28:16,750 --> 01:28:18,270
Nice to meet you, everyone.

835
01:28:18,270 --> 01:28:20,029
I've known Germa a long time,

836
01:28:20,029 --> 01:28:22,109
so I've been judging him my whole life,

837
01:28:22,109 --> 01:28:25,149
and I feel like I'm especially qualified for this opportunity.

838
01:28:25,149 --> 01:28:26,189
Camera's over there, honey.

839
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:31,180
I apologize. He's judging me.

840
01:28:31,819 --> 01:28:34,140
I know. I'm just ready to figure out who the new Germa is.

841
01:28:34,140 --> 01:28:35,739
I've been waiting for a new one for a long time,

842
01:28:35,739 --> 01:28:36,699
and I hope we get, you know,

843
01:28:36,699 --> 01:28:38,140
a better result than the first one.

844
01:28:38,140 --> 01:28:38,640
Yeah.

845
01:28:40,119 --> 01:28:41,479
By the way, when you talk about judges,

846
01:28:42,039 --> 01:28:43,159
I had to bring people in

847
01:28:43,159 --> 01:28:45,560
because there's no way I can do this by myself.

848
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:49,479
It was impossible to sit there and be like,

849
01:28:49,479 --> 01:28:51,800
oh, who's better? Who can do it? Who can't do it?

850
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:53,479
I need experts.

851
01:28:53,479 --> 01:28:55,000
And Ster has been around for a long time.

852
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:56,920
He's been around for about 12 years now

853
01:28:56,920 --> 01:28:58,279
since the very, very, very beginning.

854
01:28:58,279 --> 01:29:00,359
I'm 31. I've been around for 31 years.

855
01:29:00,359 --> 01:29:01,960
We also have Ludwig here.

856
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:04,680
Ludwig is also part of the new school of Germa fans.

857
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:06,359
He's been around for like the last few years.

858
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,680
Ludwig, thanks so much for showing up here.

859
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:09,880
Yeah, it's a pleasure.

860
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:11,399
You know, I'm one of the few people

861
01:29:11,399 --> 01:29:12,600
who actually took your role,

862
01:29:13,340 --> 01:29:15,979
and your chat tried to kill me.

863
01:29:15,979 --> 01:29:16,779
They did?

864
01:29:16,779 --> 01:29:17,819
So I'm just trying to make sure

865
01:29:17,819 --> 01:29:22,010
whoever we pick today is not at threat to die.

866
01:29:22,010 --> 01:29:24,569
It's really, I couldn't do it.

867
01:29:24,569 --> 01:29:26,489
When 16 people come in the room,

868
01:29:28,010 --> 01:29:30,729
it's hard to base who I can do it on.

869
01:29:33,420 --> 01:29:34,460
Why was that funny?

870
01:29:34,460 --> 01:29:34,939
I don't know.

871
01:29:34,939 --> 01:29:36,060
There's just a couple of words there.

872
01:29:36,859 --> 01:29:39,020
Our third, our fourth judge

873
01:29:39,100 --> 01:29:41,340
is somebody, a fan favorite of the channel.

874
01:29:42,859 --> 01:29:43,819
He's my doctor.

875
01:29:43,819 --> 01:29:45,819
He's been around since I can really remember.

876
01:29:46,699 --> 01:29:49,100
To make sure blood pressure, blood type,

877
01:29:49,100 --> 01:29:50,859
and all that is exact.

878
01:29:50,859 --> 01:29:53,500
Dr. Schmikeson, thank you for coming out here.

879
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:54,380
Thank you.

880
01:29:54,380 --> 01:29:56,060
Thank you so much for inviting me

881
01:29:56,060 --> 01:29:57,899
to be on your panel, Jeremy.

882
01:29:57,899 --> 01:29:59,420
And as you know, the others

883
01:29:59,420 --> 01:30:01,260
might be interested in your talents,

884
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:06,220
but as a doctor, I know Germa Jeremy.

885
01:30:06,220 --> 01:30:07,420
He knows me in and out.

886
01:30:07,420 --> 01:30:08,220
In and out completely.

887
01:30:08,220 --> 01:30:08,859
Wow.

888
01:30:08,859 --> 01:30:10,060
Yeah, blood type.

889
01:30:10,060 --> 01:30:11,420
We're talking blood pressure.

890
01:30:11,420 --> 01:30:13,340
And he doesn't have very much time left, right?

891
01:30:14,380 --> 01:30:15,260
For me?

892
01:30:15,260 --> 01:30:16,619
I didn't think we were going to bring that up.

893
01:30:17,819 --> 01:30:18,460
Am I dying?

894
01:30:19,100 --> 01:30:19,899
I didn't know this.

895
01:30:20,539 --> 01:30:21,579
I'd like to talk to you later

896
01:30:21,579 --> 01:30:22,460
about some Germa fans.

897
01:30:22,460 --> 01:30:24,460
Dr. Schmikeson, Ludwig and Ster

898
01:30:24,460 --> 01:30:25,739
to judge these people.

899
01:30:25,739 --> 01:30:27,899
Because I mean, we're talking about my replacement.

900
01:30:27,899 --> 01:30:29,979
And I've been a content creator.

901
01:30:29,979 --> 01:30:31,420
You've been a content creator, Ster,

902
01:30:31,420 --> 01:30:32,859
for about 12 years now.

903
01:30:33,579 --> 01:30:35,260
And trying to find the person

904
01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:37,579
that can take the brand to the next level.

905
01:30:38,539 --> 01:30:39,420
We're going to find that now.

906
01:30:40,460 --> 01:30:41,659
By the way, let's explain

907
01:30:41,659 --> 01:30:42,779
how this is going to work.

908
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:45,819
We have in front of us here, we have buttons.

909
01:30:46,619 --> 01:30:48,060
People are going to come out on stage.

910
01:30:48,779 --> 01:30:50,619
I've eliminated a few people off the bat

911
01:30:50,619 --> 01:30:52,939
because I don't think they can handle it, by the way.

912
01:30:52,939 --> 01:30:54,699
But we have a few buttons here.

913
01:30:55,260 --> 01:30:56,859
When we press these buttons,

914
01:30:57,659 --> 01:30:58,939
they are going to play.

915
01:30:58,939 --> 01:31:00,380
Okay, we don't all have to do it.

916
01:31:00,380 --> 01:31:01,340
We're demonstrating.

917
01:31:01,340 --> 01:31:02,140
They don't believe us.

918
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,199
It makes this noise.

919
01:31:05,279 --> 01:31:05,760
Three...

920
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:10,460
Three Xs means you are out.

921
01:31:11,100 --> 01:31:13,659
Three Yeses means you are into the next round.

922
01:31:14,380 --> 01:31:16,460
This is a talent portion of this stream here.

923
01:31:17,899 --> 01:31:21,020
We got Dr. Schmikeson, Ster, Ludwig.

924
01:31:21,659 --> 01:31:22,380
I think...

925
01:31:22,380 --> 01:31:23,979
Me, I'm judging you too.

926
01:31:23,979 --> 01:31:25,260
They're all backstage right now.

927
01:31:25,260 --> 01:31:26,779
Who knows Jerma better than Jerma?

928
01:31:27,420 --> 01:31:27,899
Exactly.

929
01:31:27,899 --> 01:31:28,619
Who would know me...

930
01:31:28,619 --> 01:31:29,819
Who would know me better than me?

931
01:31:29,819 --> 01:31:30,779
Nobody does.

932
01:31:30,779 --> 01:31:31,260
I know...

933
01:31:31,260 --> 01:31:32,539
Actually, I don't know me at all.

934
01:31:32,539 --> 01:31:34,539
That's why you were here.

935
01:31:35,100 --> 01:31:36,220
You lose yourself sometimes.

936
01:31:36,220 --> 01:31:38,220
I lose myself sometimes, but it's okay.

937
01:31:39,340 --> 01:31:41,100
I would like to call to the stage now.

938
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:42,300
You got soda right here

939
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:44,619
because just like that show that we can't say,

940
01:31:45,260 --> 01:31:46,060
it's delicious.

941
01:31:46,060 --> 01:31:47,420
It's got soda in there.

942
01:31:47,420 --> 01:31:47,979
Drink it up.

943
01:31:49,279 --> 01:31:51,039
Can we get number one to come out on stage, please?

944
01:31:55,449 --> 01:31:57,369
Three Xs means you are out.

945
01:31:57,369 --> 01:31:59,609
Three Yeses means you are into the next round.

946
01:31:59,609 --> 01:32:00,890
Number one, how are you?

947
01:32:00,890 --> 01:32:01,689
I am very well.

948
01:32:01,689 --> 01:32:02,649
How are you?

949
01:32:02,649 --> 01:32:03,369
Thank you, number one.

950
01:32:03,369 --> 01:32:03,770
How are you?

951
01:32:03,770 --> 01:32:04,409
Good.

952
01:32:04,409 --> 01:32:05,130
Great.

953
01:32:05,130 --> 01:32:06,170
Nobody's X-ed, right?

954
01:32:06,649 --> 01:32:07,289
Okay.

955
01:32:07,289 --> 01:32:08,649
I like the walk a lot.

956
01:32:08,649 --> 01:32:09,689
That's how you walk around.

957
01:32:09,689 --> 01:32:10,489
That's a good walker.

958
01:32:10,489 --> 01:32:10,989
Look at me.

959
01:32:12,329 --> 01:32:13,449
Somebody, somebody got it.

960
01:32:13,449 --> 01:32:14,409
Finally, somebody got it right.

961
01:32:15,210 --> 01:32:17,130
Number one, what are you going to do for us today?

962
01:32:17,130 --> 01:32:19,289
I believe I'm going to juggle today for it.

963
01:32:19,289 --> 01:32:19,770
Juggling, okay.

964
01:32:19,770 --> 01:32:22,729
Maybe sing a few bars of my favorite song as well.

965
01:32:22,729 --> 01:32:23,229
Okay.

966
01:32:23,930 --> 01:32:26,010
Whenever you're ready, we'll go ahead and get that started.

967
01:32:27,609 --> 01:32:28,109
Thank you.

968
01:32:36,520 --> 01:32:37,560
No, pull it back.

969
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:38,039
Pull it back.

970
01:32:38,039 --> 01:32:38,600
That's not fair.

971
01:32:41,149 --> 01:32:41,649
Okay.

972
01:32:42,369 --> 01:32:47,470
I just want the next hour to be this.

973
01:32:48,670 --> 01:32:50,189
Could you make a German noise while doing it?

974
01:32:50,989 --> 01:32:51,390
Higher.

975
01:32:51,949 --> 01:32:52,350
Higher.

976
01:32:53,229 --> 01:32:54,670
Oh, he dropped one.

977
01:32:54,670 --> 01:32:55,710
What do we do about that?

978
01:32:55,710 --> 01:32:56,210
Higher.

979
01:32:56,829 --> 01:32:57,329
Higher.

980
01:32:59,069 --> 01:32:59,569
Higher.

981
01:33:00,270 --> 01:33:01,149
Can you go higher?

982
01:33:01,149 --> 01:33:01,649
Go higher.

983
01:33:04,350 --> 01:33:05,390
No, don't take that back.

984
01:33:06,989 --> 01:33:08,510
Does he think we're going to hire in notes?

985
01:33:09,310 --> 01:33:09,810
What is that?

986
01:33:14,689 --> 01:33:17,170
Fan, I'm not going to say anything.

987
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:19,659
Is that it?

988
01:33:20,859 --> 01:33:22,300
Here, I'll try one more for you.

989
01:33:22,300 --> 01:33:22,779
Hold on.

990
01:33:22,779 --> 01:33:23,279
Great.

991
01:33:30,859 --> 01:33:32,060
That might have got me.

992
01:33:32,060 --> 01:33:32,560
That got me.

993
01:33:33,100 --> 01:33:33,600
Wow.

994
01:33:34,859 --> 01:33:36,140
Number one, number one.

995
01:33:37,699 --> 01:33:39,180
Okay.

996
01:33:39,180 --> 01:33:43,439
Chefs, I would say I'm going to have to be a yes on this one.

997
01:33:44,239 --> 01:33:48,079
Uh, you know, I was almost a no and I was sitting there and I was thinking

998
01:33:48,079 --> 01:33:50,479
he's not doing anything with the lower half of his body.

999
01:33:50,479 --> 01:33:52,720
And then when you incorporated the leg...

1000
01:33:55,710 --> 01:33:56,590
I'm sorry.

1001
01:33:56,590 --> 01:33:57,789
You've been disqualified.

1002
01:33:57,789 --> 01:33:58,189
I get it.

1003
01:33:58,189 --> 01:33:58,989
I totally understand.

1004
01:33:59,789 --> 01:34:00,670
It's okay.

1005
01:34:00,670 --> 01:34:01,949
I enjoyed the performance.

1006
01:34:02,750 --> 01:34:07,229
Can you explain what the thought process between ah-ee-oo was?

1007
01:34:07,229 --> 01:34:07,869
Very good.

1008
01:34:07,869 --> 01:34:08,510
Very good idea.

1009
01:34:09,470 --> 01:34:10,510
It's the greatest song in the world.

1010
01:34:10,510 --> 01:34:11,229
It's my favorite song.

1011
01:34:11,710 --> 01:34:17,149
Could you give me just a five-second interpretation of what a Raid song is?

1012
01:34:17,149 --> 01:34:17,649
Okay.

1013
01:34:18,270 --> 01:34:18,989
A Raid song?

1014
01:34:18,989 --> 01:34:19,949
A Raid song.

1015
01:34:19,949 --> 01:34:20,670
Raid song.

1016
01:34:20,670 --> 01:34:21,170
Yeah.

1017
01:34:25,310 --> 01:34:25,810
Pull it back.

1018
01:34:26,510 --> 01:34:26,909
Pull it back.

1019
01:34:26,909 --> 01:34:27,409
He goes first.

1020
01:34:28,430 --> 01:34:30,350
I don't know what my status is right now.

1021
01:34:31,869 --> 01:34:32,350
It's, uh...

1022
01:34:32,350 --> 01:34:34,189
Dr. Schmeichsen, what do you have to say?

1023
01:34:34,189 --> 01:34:35,149
Yes, yes.

1024
01:34:35,149 --> 01:34:36,430
Thank you, number one.

1025
01:34:36,430 --> 01:34:44,579
Number one, I just try to match things with this person at the other end of the table.

1026
01:34:45,140 --> 01:34:47,619
What is your basic metabolic rate?

1027
01:34:48,340 --> 01:34:48,840
Yeah.

1028
01:34:49,380 --> 01:34:54,380
So we got two X's here so far.

1029
01:34:54,380 --> 01:34:55,260
I think you pulled it back.

1030
01:34:55,260 --> 01:34:55,500
I don't...

1031
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:56,140
Did you pull it back?

1032
01:34:56,140 --> 01:34:57,340
You pulled it back.

1033
01:34:57,340 --> 01:34:58,300
It's back up again.

1034
01:34:58,300 --> 01:34:59,340
It's back up again.

1035
01:34:59,340 --> 01:35:00,140
No time left.

1036
01:35:00,140 --> 01:35:00,619
Sorry.

1037
01:35:00,619 --> 01:35:02,859
Okay, so two nos and two yeses.

1038
01:35:03,819 --> 01:35:05,180
I'm currently at a no.

1039
01:35:05,180 --> 01:35:05,680
I...

1040
01:35:07,010 --> 01:35:07,649
Whoa, whoa!

1041
01:35:07,649 --> 01:35:08,369
I don't know what...

1042
01:35:08,369 --> 01:35:09,489
You decided for me.

1043
01:35:09,489 --> 01:35:10,529
You hit my hand.

1044
01:35:10,529 --> 01:35:11,329
That was a joke.

1045
01:35:11,329 --> 01:35:11,829
Pull it back.

1046
01:35:12,850 --> 01:35:14,210
That's a yes from me.

1047
01:35:14,210 --> 01:35:16,289
I think the leg was fantastic.

1048
01:35:16,289 --> 01:35:18,050
Honestly, the leg was fantastic.

1049
01:35:18,050 --> 01:35:18,850
I think that's a good move.

1050
01:35:18,850 --> 01:35:19,409
We're split.

1051
01:35:19,409 --> 01:35:19,970
What do you want?

1052
01:35:19,970 --> 01:35:22,369
What do you want from our side, from our delegation?

1053
01:35:22,369 --> 01:35:24,020
He's got the look.

1054
01:35:24,020 --> 01:35:24,579
Uh-huh.

1055
01:35:24,579 --> 01:35:25,460
He's got the passion.

1056
01:35:26,020 --> 01:35:28,260
Schmeichsen, look, I would pull it back.

1057
01:35:28,260 --> 01:35:29,699
Can you do the thing one more time?

1058
01:35:29,699 --> 01:35:30,340
Which thing?

1059
01:35:30,340 --> 01:35:31,300
The leg, the leg.

1060
01:35:31,300 --> 01:35:31,939
With the leg.

1061
01:35:31,939 --> 01:35:32,420
Juggling leg.

1062
01:35:32,420 --> 01:35:33,460
Yeah, just one more.

1063
01:35:33,460 --> 01:35:34,260
One more time, please.

1064
01:35:36,529 --> 01:35:37,029
Okay.

1065
01:35:38,829 --> 01:35:39,470
Oh, shit.

1066
01:35:39,470 --> 01:35:40,270
I'm pulling it back.

1067
01:35:40,270 --> 01:35:40,829
That's classic.

1068
01:35:40,909 --> 01:35:41,949
No, no, no, no, no.

1069
01:35:41,949 --> 01:35:42,909
That's classic.

1070
01:35:42,909 --> 01:35:43,630
Good.

1071
01:35:43,630 --> 01:35:44,350
That's good.

1072
01:35:44,350 --> 01:35:45,470
Why did you say no?

1073
01:35:45,470 --> 01:35:47,149
I say no because he dropped it.

1074
01:35:47,149 --> 01:35:48,430
What about classic Jerma?

1075
01:35:48,430 --> 01:35:49,069
We're split.

1076
01:35:49,630 --> 01:35:51,069
We want a better Jerma.

1077
01:35:51,069 --> 01:35:51,869
No, no, he pulled it back.

1078
01:35:51,869 --> 01:35:53,229
I want the cowboy Jerma.

1079
01:35:53,229 --> 01:35:54,270
We want a better Jerma.

1080
01:35:54,270 --> 01:35:54,989
Only three yeses.

1081
01:35:54,989 --> 01:35:55,949
We both pulled.

1082
01:35:55,949 --> 01:35:56,829
That's three yeses.

1083
01:35:56,829 --> 01:35:57,949
Yeah, we're at three yeses.

1084
01:35:57,949 --> 01:35:58,510
That's three.

1085
01:35:58,510 --> 01:35:59,630
You're going through to the next round.

1086
01:35:59,630 --> 01:36:00,130
Thank you!

1087
01:36:01,149 --> 01:36:01,649
Yes!

1088
01:36:02,270 --> 01:36:02,750
Yeah!

1089
01:36:02,750 --> 01:36:03,390
Number one!

1090
01:36:05,180 --> 01:36:05,899
Okay.

1091
01:36:05,899 --> 01:36:07,420
You're not known for your clutch.

1092
01:36:07,420 --> 01:36:08,859
He's got one trick and two notes.

1093
01:36:08,859 --> 01:36:09,899
But he went under the leg.

1094
01:36:09,899 --> 01:36:10,859
That's a huge deal.

1095
01:36:10,859 --> 01:36:11,359
It is.

1096
01:36:11,899 --> 01:36:12,380
Number two.

1097
01:36:12,380 --> 01:36:13,579
If we get number two to come out.

1098
01:36:14,220 --> 01:36:15,340
Sir, you got your exit.

1099
01:36:15,340 --> 01:36:15,979
We got to clear it.

1100
01:36:17,890 --> 01:36:18,850
Dr. Shmoekson.

1101
01:36:18,850 --> 01:36:19,409
Yes, sir.

1102
01:36:19,409 --> 01:36:21,090
You have tested all the blood pressure,

1103
01:36:21,810 --> 01:36:22,770
all the blood types,

1104
01:36:24,529 --> 01:36:28,289
all the different height levels of all the patients here.

1105
01:36:28,850 --> 01:36:31,489
Can you reliably say that all these people could be

1106
01:36:32,050 --> 01:36:33,170
the next Jerma 95?

1107
01:36:34,050 --> 01:36:38,770
With some stipulation, I think that they're very close.

1108
01:36:38,770 --> 01:36:39,409
Okay, good.

1109
01:36:40,289 --> 01:36:41,090
I apologize.

1110
01:36:41,170 --> 01:36:42,210
We're calling them patients?

1111
01:36:44,939 --> 01:36:46,539
I mean someone, yeah.

1112
01:36:46,539 --> 01:36:47,579
We're calling them patients.

1113
01:36:47,579 --> 01:36:48,079
Okay.

1114
01:36:49,739 --> 01:36:50,859
Not for you!

1115
01:36:50,859 --> 01:36:51,500
That's not for you.

1116
01:36:52,220 --> 01:36:53,180
Tell us your name.

1117
01:36:53,180 --> 01:36:54,220
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1118
01:36:54,220 --> 01:36:54,720
Number two.

1119
01:36:54,720 --> 01:36:55,899
My name is Austin.

1120
01:36:55,899 --> 01:36:56,399
Okay.

1121
01:36:56,399 --> 01:36:58,140
And I'm gonna play a little song for you guys.

1122
01:36:58,779 --> 01:36:59,579
Okay, don't buzz it.

1123
01:36:59,579 --> 01:37:00,460
What's the wrong name?

1124
01:37:02,579 --> 01:37:03,380
I'm sorry, I guess...

1125
01:37:05,619 --> 01:37:07,380
Your name's supposed to be Jerma now.

1126
01:37:07,380 --> 01:37:08,579
Austin doesn't make sense.

1127
01:37:08,579 --> 01:37:09,220
Can we?

1128
01:37:09,220 --> 01:37:10,340
Is it Austin 985?

1129
01:37:10,340 --> 01:37:11,859
No, clear the board.

1130
01:37:11,859 --> 01:37:13,060
Clear the board for the love of God.

1131
01:37:13,060 --> 01:37:13,560
All agree!

1132
01:37:13,859 --> 01:37:14,359
All agree!

1133
01:37:14,359 --> 01:37:14,859
Oh, all right, all right!

1134
01:37:14,859 --> 01:37:15,359
There we are!

1135
01:37:15,359 --> 01:37:15,859
There we are!

1136
01:37:15,859 --> 01:37:16,979
We have my attention.

1137
01:37:16,979 --> 01:37:17,619
Clear the board.

1138
01:37:18,739 --> 01:37:19,619
We all clear?

1139
01:37:19,619 --> 01:37:20,260
I think we're cleared.

1140
01:37:20,260 --> 01:37:20,819
I think we're cleared.

1141
01:37:20,819 --> 01:37:21,319
Number two.

1142
01:37:21,319 --> 01:37:22,020
I think we're clear.

1143
01:37:22,020 --> 01:37:23,220
What are you gonna do for us today?

1144
01:37:23,220 --> 01:37:24,500
I'm gonna play a little song for you guys.

1145
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:25,000
Okay.

1146
01:37:25,140 --> 01:37:25,640
All right.

1147
01:37:25,640 --> 01:37:26,140
Sounds good.

1148
01:38:15,789 --> 01:38:17,789
Now it's so sweet

1149
01:38:21,710 --> 01:38:22,909
Better Jerma!

1150
01:38:22,909 --> 01:38:23,409
Hey!

1151
01:38:23,409 --> 01:38:23,909
Yes!

1152
01:38:23,909 --> 01:38:24,789
I wouldn't say that.

1153
01:38:27,359 --> 01:38:29,359
The real Jerma would have got distracted by that.

1154
01:38:29,359 --> 01:38:31,359
Pause, time, pause, pause.

1155
01:38:31,359 --> 01:38:32,479
Pause right now.

1156
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:37,760
It'd be nice having music in the background.

1157
01:38:38,640 --> 01:38:40,640
Don't you think it's like too much, though?

1158
01:38:41,359 --> 01:38:42,399
Music Mondays.

1159
01:38:43,119 --> 01:38:44,000
You think it's fun?

1160
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:44,500
Yeah.

1161
01:38:44,659 --> 01:38:45,699
I'm actually, I'm rescinding.

1162
01:38:45,699 --> 01:38:46,979
Music Mondays, let's go.

1163
01:38:46,979 --> 01:38:47,779
All right, number two.

1164
01:38:47,779 --> 01:38:49,300
Number two, thank you so much.

1165
01:38:49,300 --> 01:38:49,800
Number two.

1166
01:38:50,720 --> 01:38:51,680
Very, very good job.

1167
01:38:51,680 --> 01:38:52,180
Number two.

1168
01:38:52,180 --> 01:38:53,279
Oh, thanks so much.

1169
01:38:53,279 --> 01:38:57,039
We have, uh, we have a couple of, one no for instance here?

1170
01:38:57,039 --> 01:39:00,880
Um, you know, I'll take it back if you can answer this question well.

1171
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:04,159
I mean, you already got three yeses, but you know, maybe you can make your case.

1172
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:08,079
Really, why do you want to be Jerma?

1173
01:39:08,079 --> 01:39:08,640
Yeah.

1174
01:39:08,640 --> 01:39:13,359
Well, I just feel like, you know, teaching kids how to, how to farm properly

1175
01:39:13,359 --> 01:39:16,960
and, uh, and maintain their farms would be the best way to use my streaming services

1176
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:17,840
and take it over for Jerma.

1177
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:18,880
I mean, what a great audience.

1178
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:19,840
He's got a good point.

1179
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:20,340
Did he?

1180
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:25,039
Oh, you said it was, you can't just keep going, sir.

1181
01:39:25,039 --> 01:39:25,920
Can I ask you a question?

1182
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:26,239
Uh-huh.

1183
01:39:26,239 --> 01:39:27,359
How tall are you?

1184
01:39:27,359 --> 01:39:28,239
I'm five foot eight.

1185
01:39:28,239 --> 01:39:28,720
Perfect.

1186
01:39:28,720 --> 01:39:29,220
Perfect.

1187
01:39:30,479 --> 01:39:32,319
Dr. Schmuckson, do you have anything to add to that?

1188
01:39:33,279 --> 01:39:40,319
Yes, I actually, um, number two, I thought that was polymorphically awesome.

1189
01:39:40,319 --> 01:39:42,880
So, uh, I guess it's a go.

1190
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:43,520
That's a go?

1191
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:44,020
Yeah.

1192
01:39:44,020 --> 01:39:44,640
Yeah.

1193
01:39:44,640 --> 01:39:45,140
You know.

1194
01:39:45,140 --> 01:39:46,720
One X, but I'll take all three.

1195
01:39:46,720 --> 01:39:47,439
No, that's a yes.

1196
01:39:47,439 --> 01:39:47,920
That's a yes.

1197
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:48,720
You're going on to the next round.

1198
01:39:48,720 --> 01:39:48,960
All right.

1199
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:49,680
Great job.

1200
01:39:49,680 --> 01:39:50,479
I want to make sure that.

1201
01:39:50,479 --> 01:39:51,199
Great job.

1202
01:39:51,199 --> 01:39:54,159
You can't just fucking press the button like over and over again.

1203
01:39:54,159 --> 01:39:55,520
I don't want him to be the new you.

1204
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:56,000
That's annoying.

1205
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,359
You're better than that, Jerma.

1206
01:39:57,359 --> 01:39:57,840
You're annoying.

1207
01:39:58,960 --> 01:39:59,680
You're annoying.

1208
01:39:59,680 --> 01:40:00,399
I'm here for you.

1209
01:40:01,439 --> 01:40:03,569
Can you switch seats with him potentially?

1210
01:40:05,270 --> 01:40:05,829
Are we all clear?

1211
01:40:05,829 --> 01:40:06,229
I'll be good.

1212
01:40:06,229 --> 01:40:06,470
I'll be good.

1213
01:40:06,470 --> 01:40:09,109
Can we send out number three, please, or whoever's in the next line here?

1214
01:40:09,109 --> 01:40:10,550
I'll just pick whichever person you pick.

1215
01:40:10,550 --> 01:40:11,510
Holy smokes!

1216
01:40:11,510 --> 01:40:12,390
We've got number three here.

1217
01:40:12,390 --> 01:40:13,270
Wow.

1218
01:40:13,270 --> 01:40:14,229
I'm here.

1219
01:40:14,229 --> 01:40:15,350
Look at me.

1220
01:40:15,350 --> 01:40:16,069
He's got to look at me.

1221
01:40:16,949 --> 01:40:17,989
Right, right.

1222
01:40:17,989 --> 01:40:19,750
You have nice arms, right, Jerma?

1223
01:40:19,750 --> 01:40:21,270
No, I've got arms, yeah.

1224
01:40:21,270 --> 01:40:21,909
Oh, yeah.

1225
01:40:22,550 --> 01:40:24,069
Are you in the gym more than once a week?

1226
01:40:24,869 --> 01:40:26,390
I mean, home gym.

1227
01:40:26,390 --> 01:40:26,789
Okay.

1228
01:40:26,789 --> 01:40:27,270
Home gym.

1229
01:40:27,270 --> 01:40:27,909
He's got a home gym.

1230
01:40:27,909 --> 01:40:28,470
That's pretty good.

1231
01:40:29,189 --> 01:40:31,350
So number three, what are you going to do for us?

1232
01:40:31,350 --> 01:40:33,270
Seems like you already kind of have an idea here.

1233
01:40:33,829 --> 01:40:39,270
Well, I mean, still walking is pretty much an atmospheric talent.

1234
01:40:39,750 --> 01:40:46,229
So normally it's for creating an illusion of, you know, heightened magic.

1235
01:40:46,869 --> 01:40:47,829
Without the actual magic.

1236
01:40:47,829 --> 01:40:49,189
How tall are you right now?

1237
01:40:49,189 --> 01:40:50,069
Do you know?

1238
01:40:50,069 --> 01:40:50,789
Taller than you.

1239
01:40:51,510 --> 01:40:52,069
Okay.

1240
01:40:52,069 --> 01:40:55,590
I hear you're 5'8", but I can teach you.

1241
01:40:55,590 --> 01:40:56,390
That's fucked up.

1242
01:40:56,390 --> 01:40:58,949
In your retirement, you can be as tall as me.

1243
01:40:58,949 --> 01:41:00,069
Because I am also 5'8".

1244
01:41:01,829 --> 01:41:03,029
How tall do the stilts make you?

1245
01:41:03,029 --> 01:41:03,909
A little bit.

1246
01:41:03,909 --> 01:41:04,550
Seven foot?

1247
01:41:05,750 --> 01:41:06,869
About eight foot.

1248
01:41:06,869 --> 01:41:08,470
Okay, that's a lot of foot.

1249
01:41:09,029 --> 01:41:11,989
All right, so are you going to do a routine for us?

1250
01:41:11,989 --> 01:41:12,869
Are you going to walk around?

1251
01:41:13,670 --> 01:41:18,630
More or less, it's kind of, like I said, it's more of an atmospheric talent

1252
01:41:18,630 --> 01:41:22,159
where you can more or less do photo logs.

1253
01:41:22,159 --> 01:41:22,800
Do you do flips?

1254
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:28,159
In a world that we all live in, me and you, I can reach taller things.

1255
01:41:28,159 --> 01:41:30,560
So I feel like I'm an improved germa.

1256
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:34,520
And as you can see, I'm also firma.

1257
01:41:35,399 --> 01:41:36,310
Firma.

1258
01:41:37,189 --> 01:41:39,880
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1259
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:40,840
Don't clap yet.

1260
01:41:41,479 --> 01:41:42,600
Excuse me.

1261
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:44,680
We're allowed to have our own thoughts.

1262
01:41:44,680 --> 01:41:46,199
What's your fursona?

1263
01:41:46,199 --> 01:41:48,920
My fursona is a wolf.

1264
01:41:51,909 --> 01:41:52,869
Okay, all right.

1265
01:41:52,869 --> 01:41:53,430
You know what?

1266
01:41:53,430 --> 01:41:57,590
I will actually, from earlier, I want to correct a mistake that I made.

1267
01:41:57,590 --> 01:41:59,350
I said I didn't like rats.

1268
01:41:59,350 --> 01:42:02,149
I want to make it clear that I do like rats,

1269
01:42:02,149 --> 01:42:05,430
as long as I am the large rat that makes all the rules.

1270
01:42:05,430 --> 01:42:05,930
Interesting.

1271
01:42:07,109 --> 01:42:08,949
Is that why you have a wolf tail on, sir?

1272
01:42:09,909 --> 01:42:11,729
You know what?

1273
01:42:11,729 --> 01:42:14,529
The internet is very limited on what you can buy in two-day shipping.

1274
01:42:14,529 --> 01:42:15,029
Okay.

1275
01:42:16,210 --> 01:42:17,840
It's a global pandemic.

1276
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:18,340
True, true.

1277
01:42:19,439 --> 01:42:22,239
We've got two no's here, I think.

1278
01:42:22,239 --> 01:42:23,199
Oh, no.

1279
01:42:23,199 --> 01:42:24,079
What can I do?

1280
01:42:24,079 --> 01:42:24,579
Tell me.

1281
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:27,439
Dr. Smikson, what do you got here?

1282
01:42:28,159 --> 01:42:30,159
Well, can you...

1283
01:42:31,039 --> 01:42:31,880
Let's see.

1284
01:42:32,979 --> 01:42:34,979
Turn to your left, please.

1285
01:42:36,260 --> 01:42:37,060
Raise your right arm.

1286
01:42:39,039 --> 01:42:40,319
Make a raspberry noise.

1287
01:42:42,640 --> 01:42:44,560
Hmm, uh, no, sorry.

1288
01:42:47,300 --> 01:42:48,979
I'm so sorry, number three.

1289
01:42:50,020 --> 01:42:52,579
That is unless we can come up with some kind of agreement.

1290
01:42:52,579 --> 01:42:54,260
I'm sorry, that's where your journey ends here.

1291
01:42:54,260 --> 01:42:57,220
I mean, I was gonna give you free lessons on still walking, but I mean...

1292
01:42:57,220 --> 01:42:58,579
Oh, I can still take them.

1293
01:42:59,380 --> 01:43:00,260
I can still take them.

1294
01:43:00,260 --> 01:43:01,060
I'll pay.

1295
01:43:01,060 --> 01:43:01,779
All right.

1296
01:43:01,779 --> 01:43:02,899
Very exorbitantly.

1297
01:43:02,899 --> 01:43:03,619
What was that?

1298
01:43:03,619 --> 01:43:04,579
Very exorbitantly.

1299
01:43:07,199 --> 01:43:08,319
I'd pay extra.

1300
01:43:09,439 --> 01:43:10,880
Number three, I'm so sorry.

1301
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:12,079
There's nothing I could do.

1302
01:43:12,079 --> 01:43:13,199
Yeah, thank you, number three.

1303
01:43:13,199 --> 01:43:15,119
I appreciate your heightened performance.

1304
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,880
Thank you so much for the chance.

1305
01:43:17,880 --> 01:43:19,319
Thank you so much, number three.

1306
01:43:19,960 --> 01:43:21,159
That's actually phenomenal.

1307
01:43:21,960 --> 01:43:23,319
A very good try.

1308
01:43:23,319 --> 01:43:26,279
It would have been fun to see him hold something out of reach from you,

1309
01:43:26,279 --> 01:43:27,319
and then you jump at it.

1310
01:43:28,199 --> 01:43:29,760
I'm gonna press your X.

1311
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:30,479
Okay, sorry.

1312
01:43:30,479 --> 01:43:30,880
I'm sorry.

1313
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:31,600
That was just an idea.

1314
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:32,079
I was...

1315
01:43:32,079 --> 01:43:33,680
Let's go ahead and send it to the next one, please.

1316
01:43:33,680 --> 01:43:34,640
Who's up on tap here?

1317
01:43:34,640 --> 01:43:36,239
It should be number, I believe, number...

1318
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:39,279
Doctor, if it's clear, your X, please.

1319
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:41,520
Number four.

1320
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:43,039
Hey.

1321
01:43:43,680 --> 01:43:44,159
Okay.

1322
01:43:44,159 --> 01:43:44,800
Hi, number four.

1323
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:45,279
How are you?

1324
01:43:45,279 --> 01:43:46,000
I'm doing good, you?

1325
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:47,199
How are you?

1326
01:43:47,199 --> 01:43:48,000
I'm great, yeah.

1327
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:49,840
You were kind of a weird guy in the first round.

1328
01:43:50,720 --> 01:43:51,600
Thanks for wanting to know one, huh?

1329
01:43:52,239 --> 01:43:52,960
Yeah, it does.

1330
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:54,239
So true, so true.

1331
01:43:54,239 --> 01:43:54,960
Thank you, thank you.

1332
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:55,359
So true.

1333
01:43:55,359 --> 01:43:56,079
Number four, what are you gonna do?

1334
01:43:56,079 --> 01:43:56,960
I like this guy.

1335
01:43:56,960 --> 01:43:58,000
Hey, how's it going?

1336
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:58,399
Good, it's good.

1337
01:43:58,399 --> 01:43:59,600
What are you doing for us today?

1338
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:01,359
I'm gonna do a little cat dog.

1339
01:44:01,359 --> 01:44:01,840
Cat dog?

1340
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:02,560
Yeah, cat dog.

1341
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:03,279
Like the show?

1342
01:44:04,399 --> 01:44:05,119
It's not like the show.

1343
01:44:05,119 --> 01:44:06,079
It's just cat dog.

1344
01:44:06,079 --> 01:44:06,560
Cat dog?

1345
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:07,600
I'll take it at face value.

1346
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:08,319
I'll take it at face value.

1347
01:44:08,319 --> 01:44:09,119
Take it at face value.

1348
01:44:09,199 --> 01:44:10,319
Just love it, enjoy it, yeah.

1349
01:44:10,319 --> 01:44:10,640
Great.

1350
01:44:10,640 --> 01:44:11,119
It'll be great.

1351
01:44:11,119 --> 01:44:12,479
Okay, number four, what are you doing?

1352
01:44:12,479 --> 01:44:13,119
I love cat dog.

1353
01:44:13,119 --> 01:44:13,920
You want me to...

1354
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:14,880
He's doing cat dog.

1355
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:15,439
I don't know what that means.

1356
01:44:15,439 --> 01:44:17,680
Can you give an artist the stage for once?

1357
01:44:17,680 --> 01:44:18,640
Well, what is cat dog?

1358
01:44:19,680 --> 01:44:22,479
You go live and you say we're playing Blumplkin 3 today

1359
01:44:22,479 --> 01:44:23,600
and no one questions that.

1360
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:25,279
So, you know, just give him a shot.

1361
01:44:25,279 --> 01:44:25,680
That's true.

1362
01:44:25,680 --> 01:44:26,560
We're playing cat dog.

1363
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:27,439
Number four, you have the floor.

1364
01:44:27,439 --> 01:44:29,199
Blumplkin 3, but cat dog.

1365
01:44:29,199 --> 01:44:29,760
Yeah, go ahead.

1366
01:44:50,159 --> 01:44:52,319
Don't clap.

1367
01:44:56,319 --> 01:44:57,039
He's a bad dog.

1368
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:12,039
Absolutely fantastic performance.

1369
01:45:12,039 --> 01:45:13,319
I think the best we've seen all night.

1370
01:45:13,319 --> 01:45:15,159
We can all agree that was great.

1371
01:45:15,159 --> 01:45:16,039
I don't think so.

1372
01:45:16,039 --> 01:45:20,439
Well, I have the feeling that he suffers from dermatitis,

1373
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:25,939
but having that said, I'm good.

1374
01:45:28,180 --> 01:45:29,460
Am I the only X here?

1375
01:45:29,460 --> 01:45:31,220
Do you get dermatitis from eating ass?

1376
01:45:32,600 --> 01:45:33,079
What's that?

1377
01:45:33,079 --> 01:45:34,600
Sorry, what was that?

1378
01:45:34,600 --> 01:45:35,960
No, just from eating X.

1379
01:45:35,960 --> 01:45:36,439
That's what he...

1380
01:45:36,439 --> 01:45:37,399
From eating ass?

1381
01:45:37,399 --> 01:45:40,119
Yeah, you're speaking about the posterior.

1382
01:45:42,439 --> 01:45:43,880
Do we have a two, V2 here?

1383
01:45:44,760 --> 01:45:46,439
You know, the ass talk pulled me out.

1384
01:45:46,439 --> 01:45:48,359
Can you make some more barking noises, please?

1385
01:45:48,359 --> 01:45:50,680
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1386
01:45:50,680 --> 01:45:52,359
Wait a second, wait a second, wait a second.

1387
01:45:52,760 --> 01:45:53,720
Do we have a two, V2 here?

1388
01:45:53,720 --> 01:45:54,600
No, I pulled it back.

1389
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:58,439
It's just you, I think, that do not enjoy this.

1390
01:45:58,439 --> 01:45:59,159
I'm not sure about that.

1391
01:45:59,159 --> 01:46:02,199
But an old, aging German wouldn't know the new one if it...

1392
01:46:02,199 --> 01:46:04,199
I mean, the cat and the dog thing, it was kind of weird.

1393
01:46:04,199 --> 01:46:05,880
Like, I don't know why you have cats and dogs and shit.

1394
01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:07,720
Like, he was weird in the first phase.

1395
01:46:07,720 --> 01:46:09,920
And you didn't like the other guy for the tail.

1396
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:11,760
Well, he said he was a wolf.

1397
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:12,800
Like, what about Otto?

1398
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:13,920
Think about Otto, man.

1399
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:15,279
Get your hands off me.

1400
01:46:15,279 --> 01:46:16,640
Can I ask you a question?

1401
01:46:16,640 --> 01:46:17,199
Sure.

1402
01:46:17,199 --> 01:46:21,680
What do you think about, like, a stream where you pretend to fight yourself?

1403
01:46:22,079 --> 01:46:24,640
Like a psychopath?

1404
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:26,560
I'm not a psycho.

1405
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:27,119
No, I'm just...

1406
01:46:27,119 --> 01:46:27,600
Cool.

1407
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:28,880
Isn't that a cool stream idea?

1408
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:30,640
I mean, it's a cool idea, but I don't know.

1409
01:46:30,640 --> 01:46:33,279
So then, like, this is like fighting yourself as an animal.

1410
01:46:33,279 --> 01:46:35,300
He's a little too weird for me.

1411
01:46:35,300 --> 01:46:36,659
I think that's why we like him.

1412
01:46:36,659 --> 01:46:37,300
Yeah.

1413
01:46:37,300 --> 01:46:39,960
We're all in agreement, gentlemen.

1414
01:46:40,920 --> 01:46:42,359
Am I getting vetoed out here?

1415
01:46:42,359 --> 01:46:43,800
It's three to one.

1416
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:47,970
I'm sensing that in general, you're not ready to let go.

1417
01:46:47,970 --> 01:46:48,930
Times change, man.

1418
01:46:48,930 --> 01:46:50,210
Number four, congratulations.

1419
01:46:50,210 --> 01:46:51,250
You move on to the next round.

1420
01:46:51,970 --> 01:46:54,609
Congratulations.

1421
01:46:54,609 --> 01:46:55,890
Right on, man.

1422
01:46:56,050 --> 01:46:56,930
I love that guy.

1423
01:46:56,930 --> 01:46:59,170
On, on, my boys, unfortunately.

1424
01:46:59,170 --> 01:47:01,329
But we'll sit on the next contestant, please, if we get a chance.

1425
01:47:09,779 --> 01:47:11,140
Number five, how are you?

1426
01:47:11,140 --> 01:47:11,939
Good, good, good.

1427
01:47:11,939 --> 01:47:12,899
How are you?

1428
01:47:12,899 --> 01:47:14,100
I'm doing fantastic.

1429
01:47:14,100 --> 01:47:14,819
We're doing well.

1430
01:47:15,619 --> 01:47:16,899
Welcome to the stream, of course.

1431
01:47:16,899 --> 01:47:18,819
Welcome again for the second time.

1432
01:47:19,699 --> 01:47:20,579
I see a guitar.

1433
01:47:20,579 --> 01:47:21,539
What's that mean here?

1434
01:47:21,539 --> 01:47:26,260
Well, they handed it to me backstage and said that if I don't play it,

1435
01:47:26,260 --> 01:47:31,460
then I can't get any coffee, Cheetos, or chicken, which I was promised here.

1436
01:47:31,460 --> 01:47:34,260
Okay, that's a good callback, I think.

1437
01:47:34,260 --> 01:47:35,060
That's a pretty good callback.

1438
01:47:37,060 --> 01:47:37,859
What are you going to do for us?

1439
01:47:38,979 --> 01:47:42,899
Supposedly, I'm going to be playing a song that my mother wrote for me.

1440
01:47:42,899 --> 01:47:43,619
Your mother, okay.

1441
01:47:43,619 --> 01:47:47,859
Yeah, it was the hardest song I've ever had to learn in my entire life.

1442
01:47:48,899 --> 01:47:49,619
Let's go ahead and hear it.

1443
01:47:53,300 --> 01:47:55,460
All right, electric guitar, holy smokes.

1444
01:48:11,750 --> 01:48:29,989
I just want some coffee and Cheetos and chicken.

1445
01:48:38,159 --> 01:48:38,800
Number five.

1446
01:48:40,720 --> 01:48:44,000
Number five, before you get off stage, I just want to say,

1447
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:48,159
it looks like every judge has said no, emphatically.

1448
01:48:50,720 --> 01:48:51,840
Absolutely rubbish.

1449
01:48:52,399 --> 01:48:53,520
Don't do this, stupid.

1450
01:48:55,760 --> 01:48:56,640
That's a different show.

1451
01:48:57,520 --> 01:49:01,409
Number five, we really think that eventually going forward here,

1452
01:49:01,409 --> 01:49:05,489
that you could probably do more with, you know, maybe eventually.

1453
01:49:05,489 --> 01:49:07,250
I think there's a reason she didn't love you.

1454
01:49:11,779 --> 01:49:13,060
Someone needs to tell him.

1455
01:49:14,609 --> 01:49:21,489
Well, I just have to say this, that I would like to see you improve your talent,

1456
01:49:21,489 --> 01:49:23,890
where I do appreciate that.

1457
01:49:23,890 --> 01:49:27,010
And we've all been through things where, you know,

1458
01:49:27,729 --> 01:49:30,689
your heart expands as much as it can.

1459
01:49:32,770 --> 01:49:33,489
Oh, excuse me.

1460
01:49:33,489 --> 01:49:34,449
Yeah, maybe next year.

1461
01:49:36,609 --> 01:49:37,489
Maybe next term.

1462
01:49:37,489 --> 01:49:38,449
I'm so sorry.

1463
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:42,479
I mean, it's really emotional.

1464
01:49:42,479 --> 01:49:44,000
I can't do this.

1465
01:49:44,640 --> 01:49:47,359
Mark, I think you have talent.

1466
01:49:47,359 --> 01:49:50,960
You have what it takes, but maybe not with this exact setting,

1467
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:52,319
but you are so smart.

1468
01:49:52,319 --> 01:49:53,039
You're so good.

1469
01:49:53,039 --> 01:49:53,920
You're so talented.

1470
01:49:55,600 --> 01:49:57,920
Well, everyone should cry during the segment.

1471
01:49:57,920 --> 01:49:59,279
I'm always upset.

1472
01:49:59,279 --> 01:50:00,960
Everybody needs to cry during the segment.

1473
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:02,399
You shouldn't encourage him.

1474
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:04,800
I would pick up a new hobby.

1475
01:50:06,720 --> 01:50:08,960
No, you have to really cry otherwise they won't believe it.

1476
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:12,000
Really pick one up that's new.

1477
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:14,159
Everybody needs to cry.

1478
01:50:14,159 --> 01:50:14,800
You can do it.

1479
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:15,439
You can do it.

1480
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:17,680
Thank you so much.

1481
01:50:17,680 --> 01:50:18,399
You were five.

1482
01:50:18,399 --> 01:50:21,520
You're so, you're such a fucking angel.

1483
01:50:24,710 --> 01:50:25,189
Thank you.

1484
01:50:25,189 --> 01:50:25,689
Cheetos.

1485
01:50:27,189 --> 01:50:28,710
He had one of three.

1486
01:50:28,710 --> 01:50:32,369
I don't know why.

1487
01:50:32,369 --> 01:50:33,729
Number six, please come out, please.

1488
01:50:36,239 --> 01:50:38,399
Oh, number six, we have a little bit of a thing for number six.

1489
01:50:38,399 --> 01:50:39,279
Oh, yeah.

1490
01:50:39,279 --> 01:50:42,079
Oh, so number six, we have a small package for number six.

1491
01:50:42,079 --> 01:50:42,640
I see.

1492
01:50:42,640 --> 01:50:43,119
Just to see.

1493
01:50:43,119 --> 01:50:43,760
Small package.

1494
01:50:44,319 --> 01:50:44,960
Already German.

1495
01:50:47,119 --> 01:50:47,619
Wow.

1496
01:50:48,159 --> 01:50:49,600
Talk to Dr. Swanson earlier, so.

1497
01:50:51,279 --> 01:50:53,189
God damn it.

1498
01:50:55,109 --> 01:50:59,409
Last 10 years, I've been listing this candy store in my town.

1499
01:51:00,130 --> 01:51:03,649
It's a small beach town that leads right into the Atlantic Ocean

1500
01:51:03,649 --> 01:51:06,609
and has the oldest boardwalk in all of America.

1501
01:51:06,609 --> 01:51:12,930
My father opened this candy shop in 1956 and he built it into the place that it is today.

1502
01:51:13,729 --> 01:51:18,020
Sadly, he passed away in 2012.

1503
01:51:18,739 --> 01:51:23,090
And since then, I took over the helm of the candy shop.

1504
01:51:23,890 --> 01:51:29,729
I'm actually such a large Germa fan that I named our specially chocolate fudge after him

1505
01:51:29,729 --> 01:51:31,170
to Jolly Germa.

1506
01:51:31,170 --> 01:51:34,369
Sadly, it's one of our least popular items.

1507
01:51:35,989 --> 01:51:39,430
The one major issue with running a shop in beach town is that

1508
01:51:39,430 --> 01:51:42,949
basically all of my business comes during the summer.

1509
01:51:42,949 --> 01:51:47,909
That means that nine months out of the year, I have almost nothing to do.

1510
01:51:47,909 --> 01:51:52,310
Hearing that Germa's retiring, I believe this would be the perfect job for me to spend

1511
01:51:52,310 --> 01:51:53,829
the rest of my time during.

1512
01:51:53,829 --> 01:51:59,510
Let's go.

1513
01:51:59,510 --> 01:52:00,470
Let's go ahead and bring them out.

1514
01:52:01,189 --> 01:52:03,939
What an interesting story that was.

1515
01:52:03,939 --> 01:52:04,979
You got a number six.

1516
01:52:05,539 --> 01:52:06,100
Number six.

1517
01:52:08,210 --> 01:52:09,569
What an interesting story.

1518
01:52:09,569 --> 01:52:10,289
Number six.

1519
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:12,319
Hello.

1520
01:52:12,319 --> 01:52:13,119
How are you?

1521
01:52:13,119 --> 01:52:13,520
How are you doing?

1522
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:13,920
Number six.

1523
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:14,399
How are you?

1524
01:52:14,399 --> 01:52:14,960
I'm excellent.

1525
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:16,000
How are you doing today?

1526
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:16,880
Fantastically.

1527
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:17,359
How are you?

1528
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:18,800
I'm wonderful.

1529
01:52:19,359 --> 01:52:19,680
I'm good.

1530
01:52:19,680 --> 01:52:20,159
How are you?

1531
01:52:20,960 --> 01:52:22,720
I guess we're going to go through this a few times.

1532
01:52:22,720 --> 01:52:23,359
Yes.

1533
01:52:23,600 --> 01:52:24,640
Can I chime in?

1534
01:52:24,640 --> 01:52:25,760
I'm wondering how you're doing today.

1535
01:52:27,760 --> 01:52:28,880
Beyond mediocre.

1536
01:52:28,880 --> 01:52:29,199
Great.

1537
01:52:29,199 --> 01:52:29,760
Okay.

1538
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:31,199
What are you doing for us today?

1539
01:52:31,199 --> 01:52:34,239
Today, I will be doing a Yoda impersonation.

1540
01:52:34,239 --> 01:52:34,560
Oh.

1541
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:35,119
Yoda.

1542
01:52:35,119 --> 01:52:36,000
I love that.

1543
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:37,199
From the Star Wars.

1544
01:52:37,199 --> 01:52:38,159
From the Star Wars.

1545
01:52:38,159 --> 01:52:38,720
All right.

1546
01:52:38,720 --> 01:52:39,039
All right.

1547
01:52:39,039 --> 01:52:39,600
Excellent.

1548
01:52:39,600 --> 01:52:40,960
What's your favorite Star Wars movie?

1549
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:41,199
Sorry.

1550
01:52:41,199 --> 01:52:42,479
What's your favorite Star Wars movie?

1551
01:52:43,199 --> 01:52:44,560
Has to be Empire Strikes Back.

1552
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:44,880
Okay.

1553
01:52:45,439 --> 01:52:46,159
Okay.

1554
01:52:46,159 --> 01:52:47,680
I only watch the prequels, but that's fun.

1555
01:52:47,680 --> 01:52:48,159
That's fun.

1556
01:52:49,119 --> 01:52:50,479
It is where Yoda showed up.

1557
01:52:51,199 --> 01:52:52,640
So you take a moment.

1558
01:52:53,279 --> 01:52:54,079
You're going to do Yoda?

1559
01:52:54,079 --> 01:52:55,600
To get into character.

1560
01:52:55,600 --> 01:52:56,000
Oh.

1561
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:56,640
Okay.

1562
01:52:56,640 --> 01:52:56,880
Sure.

1563
01:52:57,439 --> 01:52:57,760
Huh.

1564
01:53:06,369 --> 01:53:10,689
German ass to you.

1565
01:53:11,569 --> 01:53:12,949
You called it.

1566
01:53:12,949 --> 01:53:13,989
It was so good.

1567
01:53:13,989 --> 01:53:14,949
It was so good.

1568
01:53:14,949 --> 01:53:15,829
I didn't expect that.

1569
01:53:15,829 --> 01:53:17,109
Which one did you have from?

1570
01:53:17,109 --> 01:53:18,630
Yoda speaks in backward sentences,

1571
01:53:18,630 --> 01:53:19,109
so I was like,

1572
01:53:19,109 --> 01:53:20,470
why would a disappointing start to a sentence?

1573
01:53:20,470 --> 01:53:20,710
Hold on.

1574
01:53:20,710 --> 01:53:21,189
Let him go.

1575
01:53:21,189 --> 01:53:21,670
Let him go.

1576
01:53:21,670 --> 01:53:22,869
Question pending is.

1577
01:53:23,430 --> 01:53:24,069
Question for me.

1578
01:53:24,869 --> 01:53:26,149
It ass to you.

1579
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:29,439
They love it.

1580
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:30,479
They love it.

1581
01:53:30,479 --> 01:53:30,960
You're not answering.

1582
01:53:30,960 --> 01:53:32,239
You're going to have to tell the people.

1583
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:34,000
Uh, uh, okay.

1584
01:53:36,979 --> 01:53:37,859
Follow-up question.

1585
01:53:37,859 --> 01:53:39,859
Do I have a follow-up?

1586
01:53:39,859 --> 01:53:40,180
Okay.

1587
01:53:40,180 --> 01:53:41,539
What's your follow-up pressure?

1588
01:53:41,539 --> 01:53:42,979
Your own ass.

1589
01:53:42,979 --> 01:53:44,100
Do you eat?

1590
01:53:44,100 --> 01:53:45,060
Can I press yours here?

1591
01:53:46,100 --> 01:53:47,539
I've had enough of this.

1592
01:53:47,539 --> 01:53:48,500
No, I'm enjoying this.

1593
01:53:48,500 --> 01:53:49,060
This is good.

1594
01:53:49,060 --> 01:53:49,300
Sure.

1595
01:53:49,300 --> 01:53:50,180
Do you hear the crowd?

1596
01:53:50,180 --> 01:53:51,460
The crowd loves him.

1597
01:53:51,460 --> 01:53:52,979
The crowd wants to see him.

1598
01:53:52,979 --> 01:53:53,699
Rule of threes.

1599
01:53:53,699 --> 01:53:54,420
Give him a third.

1600
01:53:55,220 --> 01:53:56,819
Give us another.

1601
01:53:56,819 --> 01:53:57,699
German.

1602
01:53:57,699 --> 01:53:57,939
Yeah.

1603
01:53:59,300 --> 01:54:00,739
What height claim you to be?

1604
01:54:01,460 --> 01:54:02,260
Five eight with shoes.

1605
01:54:03,890 --> 01:54:05,489
Five eight with dress shoes.

1606
01:54:05,489 --> 01:54:06,689
Just like everybody else here.

1607
01:54:07,409 --> 01:54:09,729
Because it gives you an extra oomph.

1608
01:54:09,729 --> 01:54:10,850
What are you without shoes?

1609
01:54:10,850 --> 01:54:11,329
Five seven.

1610
01:54:11,329 --> 01:54:12,369
You might not just say five seven.

1611
01:54:12,369 --> 01:54:12,850
Because that's.

1612
01:54:13,810 --> 01:54:15,010
Don't do that one.

1613
01:54:15,010 --> 01:54:15,970
Play that one back.

1614
01:54:15,970 --> 01:54:16,850
Oh man.

1615
01:54:16,850 --> 01:54:18,289
Five eight you claim to be?

1616
01:54:18,289 --> 01:54:19,729
Five eight with dress shoes.

1617
01:54:19,729 --> 01:54:20,609
Full of shit you are.

1618
01:54:21,409 --> 01:54:22,680
I want more.

1619
01:54:22,680 --> 01:54:23,479
I want more nos.

1620
01:54:24,039 --> 01:54:25,239
From the original Saga.

1621
01:54:25,239 --> 01:54:25,479
Right?

1622
01:54:25,479 --> 01:54:25,960
That line?

1623
01:54:25,960 --> 01:54:26,119
Yeah.

1624
01:54:26,119 --> 01:54:26,600
All right.

1625
01:54:26,600 --> 01:54:27,560
I'm just going to re-joke with that.

1626
01:54:27,560 --> 01:54:30,119
Can we please keep our hands to ourselves?

1627
01:54:30,119 --> 01:54:31,399
I'm going to press that one for Ludwig

1628
01:54:31,399 --> 01:54:33,079
because I don't think he should press yes.

1629
01:54:33,079 --> 01:54:33,479
German.

1630
01:54:35,039 --> 01:54:36,159
Familiar do you look?

1631
01:54:36,960 --> 01:54:37,199
Yeah.

1632
01:54:38,500 --> 01:54:39,939
C.I.U.

1633
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:42,199
In a Spider-Man movie.

1634
01:54:46,239 --> 01:54:47,119
A villain would you?

1635
01:54:48,930 --> 01:54:50,210
In three one.

1636
01:54:50,210 --> 01:54:52,130
Wait Willem Dafoe.

1637
01:54:52,130 --> 01:54:53,090
It's a Willem Dafoe reference.

1638
01:54:53,090 --> 01:54:53,890
A Willem Dafoe reference.

1639
01:54:53,890 --> 01:54:54,529
Okay it's a Willem.

1640
01:54:54,529 --> 01:54:54,850
Okay.

1641
01:54:54,850 --> 01:54:56,609
I got it but C.I.U. in.

1642
01:54:57,489 --> 01:54:59,409
I'm a connoisseur of memes myself.

1643
01:54:59,409 --> 01:54:59,649
Yeah.

1644
01:55:00,529 --> 01:55:01,729
I mean what do we got here?

1645
01:55:01,729 --> 01:55:02,850
We got three.

1646
01:55:02,850 --> 01:55:03,010
Yeah.

1647
01:55:03,010 --> 01:55:03,729
Is anybody?

1648
01:55:03,729 --> 01:55:04,369
Schmoyxen.

1649
01:55:04,369 --> 01:55:06,689
Schmoyxen do you want to try to switch us or?

1650
01:55:07,890 --> 01:55:08,770
Let's see.

1651
01:55:08,850 --> 01:55:10,130
Perhaps a song we could sing.

1652
01:55:10,850 --> 01:55:13,489
I just I just want to know one thing.

1653
01:55:13,489 --> 01:55:15,409
Are the ears dry cleanable?

1654
01:55:17,199 --> 01:55:19,199
I regularly swab them.

1655
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:20,960
That was forward.

1656
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:21,680
It was forward.

1657
01:55:21,680 --> 01:55:22,239
Oh shit.

1658
01:55:22,239 --> 01:55:23,680
He didn't flip it.

1659
01:55:23,680 --> 01:55:24,399
Let me swab.

1660
01:55:24,399 --> 01:55:25,840
That was not Yoda.

1661
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:27,199
That was not Yoda bra-

1662
01:55:27,199 --> 01:55:28,560
That was not Yoda based.

1663
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:32,960
That was out of character for what Yoda's speech patterns are.

1664
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:34,239
To the human was I speaking.

1665
01:55:36,479 --> 01:55:37,520
We got three.

1666
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:38,239
Previously.

1667
01:55:38,239 --> 01:55:39,039
Number six.

1668
01:55:39,039 --> 01:55:39,920
I'm so sorry.

1669
01:55:40,979 --> 01:55:42,579
Good luck on the candy store.

1670
01:55:42,579 --> 01:55:43,380
I heard it.

1671
01:55:43,380 --> 01:55:44,260
I hope it goes well.

1672
01:55:44,979 --> 01:55:45,619
How dare you.

1673
01:55:46,899 --> 01:55:47,699
Again that's not.

1674
01:55:52,399 --> 01:55:53,600
Not too late for me to-

1675
01:55:53,600 --> 01:55:55,039
Oh I'm gone.

1676
01:55:55,039 --> 01:55:56,079
Is it time for me to stay please?

1677
01:55:56,079 --> 01:55:56,800
Number six.

1678
01:55:56,800 --> 01:55:57,840
Thank you so much.

1679
01:55:57,840 --> 01:55:58,800
That was unbelievable.

1680
01:55:58,800 --> 01:55:59,279
Goodbye.

1681
01:55:59,279 --> 01:55:59,520
Thank you.

1682
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:01,439
It's about way too dank.

1683
01:56:02,479 --> 01:56:03,119
I guess maybe-

1684
01:56:03,119 --> 01:56:03,680
Are clapping?

1685
01:56:03,680 --> 01:56:04,159
Is it loud?

1686
01:56:05,039 --> 01:56:06,640
No I think it was a second before.

1687
01:56:06,640 --> 01:56:07,520
Oh a second before.

1688
01:56:08,560 --> 01:56:09,119
Unfortunately number six is-

1689
01:56:09,119 --> 01:56:10,159
Can you do your Yoda?

1690
01:56:10,159 --> 01:56:10,960
Do you have one?

1691
01:56:10,960 --> 01:56:11,760
I could probably do a Yoda.

1692
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:12,159
Let me try.

1693
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:20,399
Is that bad?

1694
01:56:21,359 --> 01:56:23,680
It really was one word elongated.

1695
01:56:26,479 --> 01:56:27,840
You sound like the sweetest chef.

1696
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:31,039
I believe I heard a yodel.

1697
01:56:32,399 --> 01:56:33,199
Wait hold on.

1698
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:34,880
Am I little-

1699
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:35,439
I must-

1700
01:56:36,319 --> 01:56:38,479
We must go to the store.

1701
01:56:38,479 --> 01:56:39,039
What did he say?

1702
01:56:39,439 --> 01:56:41,119
Not that.

1703
01:56:41,119 --> 01:56:41,920
He doesn't say let's go to the store.

1704
01:56:41,920 --> 01:56:43,199
Maybe he was the next Jerma.

1705
01:56:43,199 --> 01:56:44,159
You both can't do it.

1706
01:56:44,720 --> 01:56:45,439
Wait hold on.

1707
01:56:46,640 --> 01:56:49,760
Yes we must learn you the force we will.

1708
01:56:49,760 --> 01:56:50,239
That was good.

1709
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:51,920
Don't tell us it's good.

1710
01:56:51,920 --> 01:56:53,600
I feel like we are the judges.

1711
01:56:53,600 --> 01:56:54,880
Do you think it was good doctor?

1712
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:56,159
We are-

1713
01:56:56,159 --> 01:56:57,039
Tony you can't X me.

1714
01:56:57,039 --> 01:56:57,920
You're over there.

1715
01:56:57,920 --> 01:56:58,880
One two three.

1716
01:56:58,880 --> 01:56:59,520
Judges.

1717
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:00,079
Uh huh.

1718
01:57:00,079 --> 01:57:00,800
Okay who's-

1719
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:01,520
I think it was all right.

1720
01:57:02,319 --> 01:57:03,760
All right we need to clear the X's.

1721
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:04,159
Clear.

1722
01:57:04,159 --> 01:57:04,880
We were Xing you.

1723
01:57:07,970 --> 01:57:08,689
Oh are you?

1724
01:57:08,689 --> 01:57:10,289
Why do you have to go like this when you do Yoda?

1725
01:57:11,250 --> 01:57:11,890
You don't.

1726
01:57:11,890 --> 01:57:14,210
I think that's what you're doing that makes it bad.

1727
01:57:14,210 --> 01:57:14,850
Is that my fault?

1728
01:57:15,489 --> 01:57:17,649
You're doing a chicken that is walking.

1729
01:57:17,649 --> 01:57:19,569
I got a phone here and I'm ready to call somebody.

1730
01:57:19,569 --> 01:57:20,130
Okay.

1731
01:57:20,130 --> 01:57:21,090
Okay I-

1732
01:57:21,090 --> 01:57:21,890
Is that a threat?

1733
01:57:23,489 --> 01:57:24,050
Hello Mr. President.

1734
01:57:24,050 --> 01:57:25,010
I loved your Yoda.

1735
01:57:26,050 --> 01:57:26,609
That helps.

1736
01:57:26,609 --> 01:57:27,970
Your Yoda was fantastic.

1737
01:57:27,970 --> 01:57:29,810
Oh he's on the phone again guys.

1738
01:57:31,239 --> 01:57:34,579
Oh my god okay so we've got a-

1739
01:57:34,579 --> 01:57:37,380
I think there's a piano player coming up here.

1740
01:57:37,380 --> 01:57:39,539
If they take a second longer to get set up

1741
01:57:39,539 --> 01:57:41,460
which is not their responsibility I'm buzzing.

1742
01:57:41,859 --> 01:57:45,510
Okay I think we're ready to bring in the next person.

1743
01:57:46,470 --> 01:57:49,520
Number eight how are you?

1744
01:57:49,520 --> 01:57:50,880
I'm good how are you all?

1745
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:52,399
Very good very good very good.

1746
01:57:52,399 --> 01:57:53,439
Awesome.

1747
01:57:53,439 --> 01:57:54,880
What are you doing here?

1748
01:57:54,880 --> 01:57:56,720
Well I'm a big musical theater fan.

1749
01:57:56,720 --> 01:57:57,199
Okay.

1750
01:57:57,199 --> 01:57:59,920
So I know you've all heard maybe like Cats the Musical

1751
01:57:59,920 --> 01:58:03,520
but you know I'm just really inspired by you in German if I'm being honest.

1752
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:06,560
And I made a mini musical.

1753
01:58:06,560 --> 01:58:09,840
It's Rats the mini stage reading.

1754
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:12,880
So I want to present it to you here hopefully so you can like pick it up

1755
01:58:12,880 --> 01:58:13,760
and you know like do something with it.

1756
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:15,680
I really want to go to Broadway but like this is-

1757
01:58:15,680 --> 01:58:17,119
you're the first person to see this.

1758
01:58:17,119 --> 01:58:18,640
I put a lot of work into it so.

1759
01:58:18,640 --> 01:58:19,199
Okay.

1760
01:58:19,199 --> 01:58:19,680
Yeah.

1761
01:58:19,680 --> 01:58:21,119
This is- you wrote this?

1762
01:58:21,119 --> 01:58:24,800
Oh no it's totally Jerma's creation the Rats song.

1763
01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:25,920
You're bringing it to life.

1764
01:58:27,039 --> 01:58:28,000
I'm bringing it to life.

1765
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:31,359
It's like he made Shrek and you're doing Shrek the musical theater adaption.

1766
01:58:31,359 --> 01:58:35,359
Absolutely I have a little choreographed dance to the song.

1767
01:58:35,359 --> 01:58:41,119
I have a dramatic stage reading and then yeah an improv jazz piano performance.

1768
01:58:41,119 --> 01:58:41,600
Okay.

1769
01:58:41,600 --> 01:58:43,520
I'm really hoping you'll enjoy it.

1770
01:58:43,600 --> 01:58:46,319
Kind of like you have before take with it and then we'll see how it goes.

1771
01:58:46,319 --> 01:58:46,560
Yeah.

1772
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:47,039
Absolutely.

1773
01:58:47,039 --> 01:58:47,600
You gotta get away.

1774
01:58:47,600 --> 01:58:48,319
You have the floor.

1775
01:58:48,319 --> 01:58:48,720
Awesome.

1776
01:58:48,720 --> 01:58:50,399
All right then we'll put this here and we'll start with the dance.

1777
01:58:50,399 --> 01:58:51,359
Yeah go for it.

1778
01:58:51,359 --> 01:58:52,399
You wrote a musical?

1779
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:55,680
No but I made a video with 3D move maker and it sucked.

1780
01:58:56,720 --> 01:58:58,079
People on TikTok thought it was funny.

1781
01:58:58,800 --> 01:58:59,890
That's all that really matters.

1782
01:58:59,890 --> 01:59:01,329
I'm huge on TikTok by the way.

1783
01:59:01,329 --> 01:59:01,890
Okay.

1784
01:59:01,890 --> 01:59:02,770
I checked it's not.

1785
01:59:03,489 --> 01:59:04,050
I mean I am.

1786
01:59:14,050 --> 01:59:16,850
That makes all of them fools.

1787
01:59:16,850 --> 01:59:20,850
Let's see what kind of troll we get ourselves into.

1788
01:59:32,850 --> 01:59:33,890
Oh yes.

1789
01:59:33,890 --> 01:59:36,130
It's gonna be great on TikTok.

1790
01:59:36,130 --> 01:59:37,569
That was amazing.

1791
01:59:37,569 --> 01:59:38,289
I don't believe it.

1792
01:59:38,289 --> 01:59:39,250
Part one!

1793
01:59:39,250 --> 01:59:40,050
I don't believe it.

1794
01:59:40,609 --> 01:59:41,329
I don't believe it.

1795
01:59:47,880 --> 01:59:49,640
Dramatic reading of The Rats.

1796
01:59:50,439 --> 01:59:50,600
Okay.

1797
01:59:50,600 --> 01:59:51,560
As done by Jerma.

1798
01:59:52,279 --> 01:59:54,600
Impersonating Wanda Bo.

1799
01:59:58,100 --> 01:59:58,659
Rats.

1800
01:59:59,699 --> 02:00:00,899
We're rats.

1801
02:00:01,460 --> 02:00:04,340
We're the rats.

1802
02:00:05,569 --> 02:00:07,489
We pray at night.

1803
02:00:08,130 --> 02:00:10,609
We stalk at night.

1804
02:00:11,489 --> 02:00:13,569
We're the rats.

1805
02:00:16,260 --> 02:00:21,460
I'm the giant rat that makes all of the room.

1806
02:00:21,460 --> 02:00:22,899
Let's see what kind of trouble.

1807
02:00:26,479 --> 02:00:26,800
Rats.

1808
02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:28,159
Rats.

1809
02:00:28,960 --> 02:00:30,920
We're the rats.

1810
02:00:33,520 --> 02:00:33,920
Peter.

1811
02:00:35,829 --> 02:00:37,270
It's your birthday today.

1812
02:00:37,270 --> 02:00:40,960
Ice cream is on it's way.

1813
02:00:42,609 --> 02:00:43,109
Peter.

1814
02:00:44,439 --> 02:00:46,760
You've been such a good boy this year.

1815
02:00:48,920 --> 02:00:51,380
Chris is.

1816
02:00:52,500 --> 02:00:53,380
And then we'll cheer.

1817
02:00:59,439 --> 02:01:01,760
There's another part to this apparently.

1818
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:02,479
The third act.

1819
02:01:02,479 --> 02:01:03,439
The third act.

1820
02:01:03,439 --> 02:01:03,920
Buckle in.

1821
02:01:04,640 --> 02:01:06,239
He's gonna play something on the keyboard.

1822
02:01:09,810 --> 02:01:10,310
Check.

1823
02:01:15,489 --> 02:01:16,210
How are we looking?

1824
02:01:16,850 --> 02:01:17,350
Okay.

1825
02:01:21,090 --> 02:01:21,810
Test the tune out.

1826
02:01:21,810 --> 02:01:22,770
Make sure the tune is okay.

1827
02:01:23,409 --> 02:01:24,050
Yeah.

1828
02:01:24,050 --> 02:01:24,529
Check, check.

1829
02:01:24,529 --> 02:01:25,250
All right.

1830
02:01:25,250 --> 02:01:25,750
Okay.

1831
02:01:26,289 --> 02:01:34,949
That is...

1832
02:01:34,949 --> 02:01:35,270
Yeah.

1833
02:01:35,270 --> 02:01:35,989
I have no idea.

1834
02:01:36,550 --> 02:01:37,779
A connoisseur.

1835
02:01:37,779 --> 02:01:38,420
True connoisseur.

1836
02:01:38,420 --> 02:01:38,920
Mm-hmm.

1837
02:01:42,560 --> 02:01:44,560
Rats.

1838
02:01:45,680 --> 02:01:48,319
We're rats.

1839
02:01:48,319 --> 02:01:48,880
Damn.

1840
02:01:48,880 --> 02:01:54,770
We're the rats.

1841
02:01:54,770 --> 02:01:55,270
Stalk.

1842
02:01:57,460 --> 02:01:59,779
In the night.

1843
02:01:59,779 --> 02:02:04,899
We pray at night.

1844
02:02:04,899 --> 02:02:05,859
Yeah, yeah.

1845
02:02:07,880 --> 02:02:10,279
We're rats.

1846
02:02:10,279 --> 02:02:11,590
Not done yet.

1847
02:02:11,590 --> 02:02:12,880
Hold your applause.

1848
02:02:12,880 --> 02:02:13,359
Thank you.

1849
02:02:14,079 --> 02:02:15,279
I was about to clap.

1850
02:02:15,279 --> 02:02:16,000
I was getting there.

1851
02:02:26,479 --> 02:02:30,319
I'm the giant rat.

1852
02:02:30,319 --> 02:02:36,869
That makes all the rats.

1853
02:02:45,350 --> 02:02:46,149
What?

1854
02:02:46,149 --> 02:02:46,869
I'll explain after.

1855
02:02:57,560 --> 02:02:59,720
You would have buzzed him by now if he wasn't so good at it.

1856
02:02:59,720 --> 02:03:01,560
But this is painful for you.

1857
02:03:03,720 --> 02:03:04,520
That's good enough.

1858
02:03:04,520 --> 02:03:05,020
All right.

1859
02:03:05,020 --> 02:03:08,060
Ice cream is on its way.

1860
02:03:10,859 --> 02:03:13,819
Germa, Germa, Germa.

1861
02:03:13,819 --> 02:03:15,180
My goodness gracious.

1862
02:03:15,180 --> 02:03:26,300
Open up your presents and we'll have some cheese here.

1863
02:03:26,300 --> 02:03:27,899
Happy birthday.

1864
02:03:27,899 --> 02:03:29,659
It's nobody's birthday, but I'll take it.

1865
02:03:29,659 --> 02:03:30,539
It's all right.

1866
02:03:30,539 --> 02:03:31,180
It's your birthday.

1867
02:03:31,180 --> 02:03:31,899
Happy birthday.

1868
02:03:31,899 --> 02:03:33,180
I'm 37 this year.

1869
02:03:33,180 --> 02:03:33,819
37.

1870
02:03:33,819 --> 02:03:34,380
Wow.

1871
02:03:34,380 --> 02:03:35,260
All right.

1872
02:03:35,260 --> 02:03:35,739
Thank you.

1873
02:03:35,739 --> 02:03:36,380
All right.

1874
02:03:37,829 --> 02:03:38,390
Thank you.

1875
02:03:38,390 --> 02:03:39,350
Thank you so much.

1876
02:03:40,390 --> 02:03:41,350
That was really exciting for me.

1877
02:03:41,350 --> 02:03:44,550
That was phenomenal.

1878
02:03:44,550 --> 02:03:44,949
Number eight.

1879
02:03:44,949 --> 02:03:48,069
We have one X from Ludwig and I'm very curious why.

1880
02:03:48,069 --> 02:03:49,750
Yeah, I want to talk to you directly.

1881
02:03:49,750 --> 02:03:50,710
Of course.

1882
02:03:50,710 --> 02:03:51,750
You're selling yourself short.

1883
02:03:52,710 --> 02:03:56,310
I'm thinking you Kanye West, Lady Gaga.

1884
02:03:56,310 --> 02:03:57,989
OK, Steve Jobs.

1885
02:03:59,029 --> 02:04:02,229
You're doing things that Germa dreams of at night.

1886
02:04:02,229 --> 02:04:02,550
Right.

1887
02:04:02,550 --> 02:04:05,109
He falls asleep wishing he could sing and dance like that.

1888
02:04:05,189 --> 02:04:06,470
You don't know how much that means to me.

1889
02:04:06,470 --> 02:04:07,430
Like it's been years.

1890
02:04:07,989 --> 02:04:09,989
You know, just like trying and trying and trying.

1891
02:04:11,430 --> 02:04:13,029
This might be my big break.

1892
02:04:13,029 --> 02:04:16,310
I want you to know this now is another door opening.

1893
02:04:19,369 --> 02:04:20,250
What about this now?

1894
02:04:20,970 --> 02:04:21,819
What's that?

1895
02:04:21,819 --> 02:04:22,699
What are you thinking?

1896
02:04:22,699 --> 02:04:23,979
I'm having a I'm having trouble.

1897
02:04:24,699 --> 02:04:25,819
Tell me what you're having trouble with.

1898
02:04:25,819 --> 02:04:26,779
Maybe we can work this out.

1899
02:04:27,420 --> 02:04:28,939
The keyboard is coming out.

1900
02:04:28,939 --> 02:04:30,460
It was a little too dragged out.

1901
02:04:30,460 --> 02:04:31,100
I was a little.

1902
02:04:32,470 --> 02:04:34,390
You're saying no to the voice of a generation.

1903
02:04:34,390 --> 02:04:34,869
Wait, wait.

1904
02:04:35,350 --> 02:04:36,710
I might be able to like work on that.

1905
02:04:36,710 --> 02:04:38,149
We have to take number eight.

1906
02:04:38,149 --> 02:04:38,550
I know.

1907
02:04:38,550 --> 02:04:38,789
I know.

1908
02:04:38,789 --> 02:04:39,909
But I'm having trouble.

1909
02:04:41,029 --> 02:04:42,310
I think I'm going to have to phone a friend.

1910
02:04:43,579 --> 02:04:44,140
Let's go ahead.

1911
02:04:44,140 --> 02:04:45,020
Let's go ahead and call.

1912
02:04:45,020 --> 02:04:45,500
Let's go out and get.

1913
02:04:45,500 --> 02:04:46,539
Can I phone a friend here?

1914
02:04:46,539 --> 02:04:47,420
Just get some advice here.

1915
02:04:48,779 --> 02:04:49,899
It's very tricky.

1916
02:04:49,899 --> 02:04:52,220
That keyboard was fantastic, but it was a little drowned.

1917
02:04:52,220 --> 02:04:53,180
It was a little drawn out.

1918
02:04:54,810 --> 02:04:56,409
Not like what's happening right now.

1919
02:04:56,409 --> 02:04:57,609
Can we can we?

1920
02:04:57,609 --> 02:04:58,810
You're great, darling.

1921
02:04:58,810 --> 02:04:59,449
I appreciate that.

1922
02:04:59,449 --> 02:05:00,810
Can we connect to Kit Boga, please?

1923
02:05:04,539 --> 02:05:05,739
I'm phoning a friend here.

1924
02:05:05,739 --> 02:05:06,460
Four, four, four.

1925
02:05:07,100 --> 02:05:08,699
I think we're a little split on this.

1926
02:05:09,420 --> 02:05:11,159
I don't know why you're flinging it.

1927
02:05:11,979 --> 02:05:13,420
Why would you be getting a ring if you're?

1928
02:05:15,100 --> 02:05:15,600
Hello?

1929
02:05:16,539 --> 02:05:17,420
Kit Boga, hi.

1930
02:05:17,420 --> 02:05:21,979
This is Jerma985 calling from through some cell service device.

1931
02:05:21,979 --> 02:05:23,579
I want to get your advice on something.

1932
02:05:24,300 --> 02:05:24,619
What?

1933
02:05:25,420 --> 02:05:27,500
Sorry, who is this?

1934
02:05:27,500 --> 02:05:29,100
It's Jerma985.

1935
02:05:29,659 --> 02:05:30,060
Jerma.

1936
02:05:30,699 --> 02:05:31,260
Oh, hey.

1937
02:05:32,300 --> 02:05:33,819
Are you watching the stream, Kit, right now?

1938
02:05:34,539 --> 02:05:39,029
Yeah, so I'm just trying to finish this 200 word essay.

1939
02:05:39,029 --> 02:05:41,189
So yeah.

1940
02:05:41,989 --> 02:05:43,590
OK, so I got a guy up here.

1941
02:05:43,590 --> 02:05:44,470
He's number eight.

1942
02:05:44,470 --> 02:05:45,670
He played the piano.

1943
02:05:45,670 --> 02:05:46,390
He's really funny.

1944
02:05:46,390 --> 02:05:47,270
He's really interesting.

1945
02:05:49,029 --> 02:05:54,310
I need some input on if you think that he could move on to the next round as the next Jerma.

1946
02:05:54,310 --> 02:05:55,750
Have you been paying attention to the stream at all?

1947
02:05:56,710 --> 02:05:59,590
I mean, it kind of depends.

1948
02:05:59,590 --> 02:06:01,430
You want my opinion or do you?

1949
02:06:01,430 --> 02:06:02,470
I need your opinion.

1950
02:06:02,470 --> 02:06:03,829
You're one of the two calls I can make.

1951
02:06:03,909 --> 02:06:06,710
There's one more person I can call, which you'll see very soon enough.

1952
02:06:07,590 --> 02:06:09,859
I'm not really that good under pressure.

1953
02:06:10,500 --> 02:06:12,020
Well, I need it now.

1954
02:06:12,579 --> 02:06:13,779
That guy clearly is, though.

1955
02:06:14,420 --> 02:06:15,619
Number eight, clearly.

1956
02:06:15,619 --> 02:06:16,340
Clearly is no.

1957
02:06:18,619 --> 02:06:21,180
So OK, OK.

1958
02:06:21,180 --> 02:06:21,739
I'll tell you what.

1959
02:06:22,460 --> 02:06:28,140
Whoever said money can't solve your problems must have not had enough money to solve them.

1960
02:06:28,140 --> 02:06:28,539
Right?

1961
02:06:28,539 --> 02:06:29,579
Ariana Grande.

1962
02:06:29,579 --> 02:06:30,300
What are you talking about?

1963
02:06:32,380 --> 02:06:33,180
Ariana Grande.

1964
02:06:33,579 --> 02:06:34,779
Yeah, well, what is that?

1965
02:06:34,779 --> 02:06:36,220
Did you like number eight or not?

1966
02:06:36,220 --> 02:06:37,340
Like, what does that have to do with Ariana Grande?

1967
02:06:37,340 --> 02:06:40,279
The point is she says, I want it.

1968
02:06:40,279 --> 02:06:40,840
I got it.

1969
02:06:41,399 --> 02:06:41,880
I want it.

1970
02:06:41,880 --> 02:06:42,520
I got it.

1971
02:06:42,520 --> 02:06:44,359
I feel like this is you.

1972
02:06:44,920 --> 02:06:45,159
Yeah.

1973
02:06:45,159 --> 02:06:45,960
What do you want?

1974
02:06:47,159 --> 02:06:50,520
I want my replacement kit and it's hard to do.

1975
02:06:51,399 --> 02:06:52,520
I love Ariana Grande.

1976
02:06:54,439 --> 02:06:56,119
OK, put him, pass him through.

1977
02:06:56,119 --> 02:06:56,680
Wait, what?

1978
02:06:56,680 --> 02:06:56,920
Yeah.

1979
02:06:57,640 --> 02:06:59,130
He loves Ariana Grande.

1980
02:06:59,130 --> 02:07:00,010
Put him through.

1981
02:07:00,010 --> 02:07:03,609
That's your criteria is if they like Ariana Grande, is pass him through.

1982
02:07:04,409 --> 02:07:04,970
He's really popular.

1983
02:07:04,970 --> 02:07:05,689
It's enough for me.

1984
02:07:05,689 --> 02:07:06,329
She's hot.

1985
02:07:06,329 --> 02:07:06,649
She's hot.

1986
02:07:06,649 --> 02:07:08,329
Hey, he's popping off.

1987
02:07:08,329 --> 02:07:10,010
Kit, thanks for absolutely nothing.

1988
02:07:12,069 --> 02:07:12,550
She's hot.

1989
02:07:12,550 --> 02:07:13,350
What a fucking crutch.

1990
02:07:13,350 --> 02:07:14,869
Don't spill that soda, sponsor.

1991
02:07:17,909 --> 02:07:18,789
I got some input.

1992
02:07:21,430 --> 02:07:21,909
Number eight.

1993
02:07:23,640 --> 02:07:24,199
Oh, yeah.

1994
02:07:24,199 --> 02:07:25,960
We have a yes from Dr. Schmikeson.

1995
02:07:25,960 --> 02:07:26,920
Is that what it is?

1996
02:07:26,920 --> 02:07:27,399
Yeah.

1997
02:07:27,399 --> 02:07:36,149
Well, all I have to say, you almost had me in tears, but I just have to say it's quite

1998
02:07:36,949 --> 02:07:39,689
uber-germaniac.

1999
02:07:39,689 --> 02:07:40,409
Definitely.

2000
02:07:41,369 --> 02:07:41,689
Thank you.

2001
02:07:41,689 --> 02:07:42,250
That means a lot.

2002
02:07:44,390 --> 02:07:44,869
Number eight.

2003
02:07:45,510 --> 02:07:47,260
I'm going to have to tell you.

2004
02:07:47,819 --> 02:07:50,340
Congratulations.

2005
02:07:50,340 --> 02:07:51,460
You've moved on to the next round.

2006
02:07:52,500 --> 02:07:53,140
You earned it.

2007
02:07:54,439 --> 02:07:55,159
Really good.

2008
02:07:55,159 --> 02:07:55,960
Really good stuff.

2009
02:07:55,960 --> 02:07:57,000
Thank you so much.

2010
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:57,960
I really won't let you down.

2011
02:07:57,960 --> 02:07:58,760
This guy's the limit.

2012
02:07:58,760 --> 02:07:59,399
This is going places.

2013
02:07:59,399 --> 02:08:00,600
This guy's the limit.

2014
02:08:00,600 --> 02:08:01,159
Thank you.

2015
02:08:01,159 --> 02:08:01,560
Thank you.

2016
02:08:01,560 --> 02:08:02,039
Number eight.

2017
02:08:02,039 --> 02:08:03,560
You've moved on to the next round.

2018
02:08:03,560 --> 02:08:05,319
I just like him one bit, honestly.

2019
02:08:05,319 --> 02:08:06,199
Why did you say yes?

2020
02:08:06,199 --> 02:08:07,159
He couldn't take it.

2021
02:08:07,159 --> 02:08:07,800
You're an idiot.

2022
02:08:08,840 --> 02:08:09,319
You can tell.

2023
02:08:09,319 --> 02:08:10,439
Why would you vote yes?

2024
02:08:10,439 --> 02:08:13,640
He would shatter at any negativity.

2025
02:08:13,640 --> 02:08:14,439
Why would you say yes?

2026
02:08:14,439 --> 02:08:15,319
He's just like a germa.

2027
02:08:16,039 --> 02:08:17,560
I don't shatter at negativity.

2028
02:08:17,560 --> 02:08:18,439
Oh, that's a good-

2029
02:08:18,439 --> 02:08:19,319
That's why you passed him through.

2030
02:08:19,319 --> 02:08:20,680
Look where he's going right now.

2031
02:08:20,680 --> 02:08:23,000
I do not shatter at negativity.

2032
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:24,039
No, I don't.

2033
02:08:24,039 --> 02:08:25,319
I take a lot of shit.

2034
02:08:25,319 --> 02:08:27,079
I feel like you're not listening to what Kit said.

2035
02:08:27,960 --> 02:08:29,319
He said Ariana Grande's.

2036
02:08:30,039 --> 02:08:31,079
He said no, then he said yes.

2037
02:08:31,079 --> 02:08:31,720
It was hard to tell.

2038
02:08:32,439 --> 02:08:32,760
I take-

2039
02:08:32,760 --> 02:08:33,479
You want it.

2040
02:08:33,479 --> 02:08:34,039
I got it.

2041
02:08:37,689 --> 02:08:38,810
Clear your boards, please.

2042
02:08:38,810 --> 02:08:39,689
We have the next person coming up.

2043
02:08:39,689 --> 02:08:40,729
We're cleared.

2044
02:08:40,729 --> 02:08:41,689
Where's my chapstick?

2045
02:08:41,689 --> 02:08:43,050
I'm fucking freaked the fuck out.

2046
02:08:43,609 --> 02:08:44,890
Negativity.

2047
02:08:44,890 --> 02:08:46,170
I've got some on my lips.

2048
02:08:46,170 --> 02:08:46,670
I know.

2049
02:08:47,369 --> 02:08:49,880
Excuse me.

2050
02:08:50,920 --> 02:08:51,319
All right.

2051
02:08:51,319 --> 02:08:52,760
Number nine is out here now.

2052
02:08:52,760 --> 02:08:53,960
Number nine, how are you?

2053
02:08:53,960 --> 02:08:55,000
Welcome to the screen.

2054
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:55,640
Number nine.

2055
02:08:58,069 --> 02:08:58,630
It works.

2056
02:08:58,630 --> 02:08:59,750
Don't tap it, please.

2057
02:08:59,750 --> 02:09:00,310
Audio issues.

2058
02:09:00,310 --> 02:09:01,109
That's a good German one.

2059
02:09:01,989 --> 02:09:02,470
There we go.

2060
02:09:02,470 --> 02:09:02,970
Very good.

2061
02:09:03,909 --> 02:09:04,550
Hi.

2062
02:09:04,550 --> 02:09:05,590
Hi, number nine.

2063
02:09:05,590 --> 02:09:06,310
Hi.

2064
02:09:06,310 --> 02:09:07,109
How are you?

2065
02:09:07,109 --> 02:09:08,470
I am doing excellent.

2066
02:09:08,470 --> 02:09:09,270
Are you excited?

2067
02:09:09,270 --> 02:09:11,430
I am literally shaking right now.

2068
02:09:11,430 --> 02:09:13,189
You've moved this far, number nine.

2069
02:09:13,829 --> 02:09:16,069
We need a wow factor here.

2070
02:09:16,069 --> 02:09:16,569
Okay.

2071
02:09:16,949 --> 02:09:18,710
I'm going to bring it, you know,

2072
02:09:19,189 --> 02:09:22,630
I consider myself to be a dancer.

2073
02:09:23,270 --> 02:09:23,989
A dancer?

2074
02:09:23,989 --> 02:09:24,869
A dancer.

2075
02:09:24,869 --> 02:09:25,829
Something of a dancer myself.

2076
02:09:25,829 --> 02:09:26,329
A dancer.

2077
02:09:27,109 --> 02:09:27,750
It's a reference.

2078
02:09:28,789 --> 02:09:29,109
That's it.

2079
02:09:29,109 --> 02:09:29,909
That's it, Peter?

2080
02:09:29,909 --> 02:09:30,149
Yes.

2081
02:09:30,149 --> 02:09:30,789
That is it, Peter?

2082
02:09:31,510 --> 02:09:33,670
So you're going to do a dance routine or?

2083
02:09:33,670 --> 02:09:33,989
Yes.

2084
02:09:33,989 --> 02:09:36,789
I'm going to show you some break dancing here today.

2085
02:09:37,510 --> 02:09:40,229
I'm going to just use the entire area,

2086
02:09:40,229 --> 02:09:41,909
break it down for you guys a little bit,

2087
02:09:41,909 --> 02:09:42,710
show you my moves.

2088
02:09:42,710 --> 02:09:45,189
Are you aware the real German cannot break dance?

2089
02:09:45,189 --> 02:09:45,829
That's bullshit.

2090
02:09:45,829 --> 02:09:46,329
I can.

2091
02:09:47,909 --> 02:09:48,550
It's debatable.

2092
02:09:49,989 --> 02:09:52,069
I've been inspired by some of his work.

2093
02:09:52,869 --> 02:09:54,229
It looks like he's going to come up to stage

2094
02:09:54,229 --> 02:09:56,550
and he's actually going to preview it.

2095
02:09:56,550 --> 02:09:58,310
I don't know how I'm going to follow this up.

2096
02:09:58,310 --> 02:09:58,869
Get out of the way.

2097
02:09:59,590 --> 02:10:00,149
Get out of the way.

2098
02:10:01,989 --> 02:10:03,590
What did you, sir, sir, what did you say?

2099
02:10:03,590 --> 02:10:06,229
I said the real German cannot break dance.

2100
02:10:06,229 --> 02:10:06,789
Okay.

2101
02:10:06,789 --> 02:10:10,250
I think he can.

2102
02:10:10,250 --> 02:10:10,970
That wasn't me.

2103
02:10:10,970 --> 02:10:12,329
It was mostly the speed you went.

2104
02:10:14,329 --> 02:10:14,829
Wow.

2105
02:10:15,449 --> 02:10:21,529
I hope he didn't break something.

2106
02:10:22,090 --> 02:10:23,930
We all hope that you have better than that,

2107
02:10:23,930 --> 02:10:25,289
but I wish you luck.

2108
02:10:25,289 --> 02:10:27,609
I scraped, I scraped my fucking knee.

2109
02:10:27,609 --> 02:10:28,890
The next stream in three months.

2110
02:10:32,060 --> 02:10:32,619
Number nine.

2111
02:10:32,619 --> 02:10:33,579
Can you do better than that?

2112
02:10:33,579 --> 02:10:34,220
Let's find out.

2113
02:10:34,220 --> 02:10:34,939
Good luck.

2114
02:10:34,939 --> 02:10:38,789
Here we go.

2115
02:10:38,789 --> 02:10:39,670
Oh, yeah.

2116
02:10:39,670 --> 02:10:40,390
All right, all right.

2117
02:10:40,390 --> 02:10:41,430
This is a classic.

2118
02:10:41,430 --> 02:10:41,930
Okay.

2119
02:10:43,270 --> 02:10:43,909
Should we get up?

2120
02:10:43,909 --> 02:10:44,550
Should we stand up?

2121
02:10:44,550 --> 02:10:45,050
Let's stand up.

2122
02:10:46,069 --> 02:10:48,760
I'll half stand.

2123
02:10:48,760 --> 02:10:49,239
I'll do this.

2124
02:10:51,239 --> 02:10:52,119
All right, all right.

2125
02:10:53,539 --> 02:10:54,100
Warming up.

2126
02:10:55,619 --> 02:10:57,460
He's running at such rapid pace around.

2127
02:10:58,260 --> 02:10:59,539
The crab, the crab.

2128
02:10:59,539 --> 02:11:00,180
That's a crab.

2129
02:11:00,180 --> 02:11:01,300
That's very good.

2130
02:11:01,300 --> 02:11:01,859
That's very good.

2131
02:11:04,819 --> 02:11:07,859
Oh, fuck a bit of a stumble.

2132
02:11:07,859 --> 02:11:08,899
Okay, I thought he was gonna.

2133
02:11:10,100 --> 02:11:10,899
Wait, wait, he's got more.

2134
02:11:14,699 --> 02:11:15,500
Holy shit.

2135
02:11:16,539 --> 02:11:18,140
Well, that's the same thing but twice.

2136
02:11:18,140 --> 02:11:19,340
He gets a three.

2137
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:29,239
What?

2138
02:11:29,239 --> 02:11:30,119
What's the problem?

2139
02:11:30,119 --> 02:11:31,159
Why did she say no?

2140
02:11:32,279 --> 02:11:33,159
We got two nodes.

2141
02:11:33,159 --> 02:11:34,039
I immediately node.

2142
02:11:34,039 --> 02:11:34,680
He fell.

2143
02:11:34,680 --> 02:11:35,640
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2144
02:11:35,640 --> 02:11:36,840
You stumbled.

2145
02:11:36,840 --> 02:11:38,680
That was fucking phenomenal.

2146
02:11:38,680 --> 02:11:39,079
Thank you.

2147
02:11:39,079 --> 02:11:40,039
We didn't have to.

2148
02:11:40,039 --> 02:11:40,840
Could I?

2149
02:11:40,840 --> 02:11:41,239
Go ahead.

2150
02:11:41,880 --> 02:11:44,680
As an avid German viewer, sometimes

2151
02:11:44,680 --> 02:11:47,239
German has through breakdancing

2152
02:11:47,239 --> 02:11:48,279
not been able to stream

2153
02:11:48,279 --> 02:11:49,960
for extended periods of time.

2154
02:11:49,960 --> 02:11:51,319
And when I saw you fall,

2155
02:11:51,319 --> 02:11:53,159
I had a that's a raven moment

2156
02:11:53,159 --> 02:11:54,680
where you were the German

2157
02:11:54,680 --> 02:11:55,720
and you hurt yourself.

2158
02:11:56,359 --> 02:11:57,880
Where's my streamer?

2159
02:11:57,880 --> 02:11:58,600
Right.

2160
02:11:58,600 --> 02:11:59,800
What do you think about that?

2161
02:11:59,800 --> 02:12:01,000
You have people depending on you.

2162
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:02,039
You can't hurt yourself.

2163
02:12:02,039 --> 02:12:02,520
Totally.

2164
02:12:03,479 --> 02:12:04,520
First, safety is key.

2165
02:12:05,319 --> 02:12:06,279
Safety is number one.

2166
02:12:06,279 --> 02:12:09,539
Number two, I'm like a starfish

2167
02:12:09,539 --> 02:12:10,979
when it comes to like repairing

2168
02:12:10,979 --> 02:12:12,100
any sort of my body.

2169
02:12:12,739 --> 02:12:14,260
So just like quick recovery

2170
02:12:14,260 --> 02:12:15,779
like day or two in the hospital.

2171
02:12:15,779 --> 02:12:16,979
Just like Dr. Schmoyzen.

2172
02:12:17,619 --> 02:12:18,260
Can you?

2173
02:12:18,260 --> 02:12:19,939
What about starfish is Dr. Schmoyzen?

2174
02:12:19,939 --> 02:12:21,699
I think he's relating to something

2175
02:12:23,739 --> 02:12:24,779
that has to do with

2176
02:12:26,460 --> 02:12:28,220
you know, bones and tendons

2177
02:12:28,220 --> 02:12:29,500
and so on growing back.

2178
02:12:30,220 --> 02:12:32,060
But I don't think that that works

2179
02:12:32,060 --> 02:12:33,340
if you become paraplegic.

2180
02:12:33,340 --> 02:12:33,819
It's doctor.

2181
02:12:33,819 --> 02:12:34,619
Wait, Dr. Schmoyzen.

2182
02:12:34,619 --> 02:12:35,340
What's his blood type?

2183
02:12:35,340 --> 02:12:36,300
Is he is he a B?

2184
02:12:37,020 --> 02:12:38,460
I believe he's.

2185
02:12:38,460 --> 02:12:39,579
Oh, okay.

2186
02:12:39,579 --> 02:12:40,619
That's a big problem.

2187
02:12:40,619 --> 02:12:41,899
Okay, I believe he's old.

2188
02:12:41,899 --> 02:12:43,100
Oh, that's a big problem.

2189
02:12:43,100 --> 02:12:44,300
Have you donated before

2190
02:12:44,300 --> 02:12:45,819
your universal donor?

2191
02:12:45,819 --> 02:12:46,380
Yes.

2192
02:12:46,380 --> 02:12:46,699
Yes.

2193
02:12:46,699 --> 02:12:49,579
Yes, I have donated blood before.

2194
02:12:49,579 --> 02:12:51,100
We are, unfortunately,

2195
02:12:52,890 --> 02:12:53,609
we're split again.

2196
02:12:54,329 --> 02:12:56,359
I'm gonna phone.

2197
02:12:56,359 --> 02:12:57,319
I'm gonna have to call

2198
02:12:57,319 --> 02:12:58,279
italics on this one.

2199
02:12:58,840 --> 02:12:59,720
He fell.

2200
02:12:59,720 --> 02:13:01,079
That's the rule.

2201
02:13:01,079 --> 02:13:03,880
I think he has what it takes.

2202
02:13:03,880 --> 02:13:04,680
He has what it takes.

2203
02:13:05,319 --> 02:13:06,279
Okay, call.

2204
02:13:06,279 --> 02:13:06,760
Make a call.

2205
02:13:06,760 --> 02:13:07,880
Can we call italics, please?

2206
02:13:07,880 --> 02:13:08,359
Of course.

2207
02:13:08,359 --> 02:13:09,159
Get him on the line.

2208
02:13:09,159 --> 02:13:09,960
Another phone, a friend.

2209
02:13:13,350 --> 02:13:15,510
Okay, we got a few of these.

2210
02:13:19,340 --> 02:13:20,460
I thought it was phenomenal.

2211
02:13:20,460 --> 02:13:21,659
I think you guys are out of your mind.

2212
02:13:22,220 --> 02:13:24,979
I still don't get why you get a ring

2213
02:13:24,979 --> 02:13:25,859
when you call someone.

2214
02:13:26,579 --> 02:13:27,539
Because it's calling them

2215
02:13:27,539 --> 02:13:28,579
and it's ringing in their house.

2216
02:13:28,579 --> 02:13:28,899
Okay.

2217
02:13:29,619 --> 02:13:33,800
Do we have italics?

2218
02:13:37,100 --> 02:13:37,500
Hello?

2219
02:13:38,680 --> 02:13:39,159
Are you there?

2220
02:13:43,979 --> 02:13:44,939
I think I have the wrong number.

2221
02:13:46,060 --> 02:13:46,619
Try it again.

2222
02:13:48,390 --> 02:13:49,430
We're at an impasse.

2223
02:13:49,430 --> 02:13:49,829
I need.

2224
02:13:50,390 --> 02:13:51,350
Oh, wait, it's ringing.

2225
02:13:51,350 --> 02:13:51,829
It's ringing.

2226
02:13:51,829 --> 02:13:53,189
I think he's dodging your calls.

2227
02:13:53,189 --> 02:13:54,149
He's got caller ID.

2228
02:13:56,979 --> 02:13:58,420
We need an outside opinion.

2229
02:13:58,420 --> 02:13:59,140
I don't think...

2230
02:13:59,140 --> 02:14:00,100
I think he's got what it takes.

2231
02:14:00,739 --> 02:14:02,899
It's Alex.

2232
02:14:02,899 --> 02:14:04,100
Hey, can you hear me now?

2233
02:14:04,100 --> 02:14:04,659
Can hear you now.

2234
02:14:04,659 --> 02:14:05,380
It's Alex.

2235
02:14:05,380 --> 02:14:07,859
You're on Derma's Not Got Talent.

2236
02:14:07,859 --> 02:14:09,699
That would be a copyright infringement.

2237
02:14:09,699 --> 02:14:11,939
You're on Who Will Replace...

2238
02:14:11,939 --> 02:14:13,140
That's another copyright infringement.

2239
02:14:13,140 --> 02:14:14,260
Who Will Replace Me?

2240
02:14:14,260 --> 02:14:15,060
Welcome, it's Alex.

2241
02:14:15,060 --> 02:14:16,100
Welcome to the show.

2242
02:14:16,100 --> 02:14:16,899
We have number nine here.

2243
02:14:16,899 --> 02:14:18,020
You guys can hear me.

2244
02:14:18,020 --> 02:14:18,340
Yes.

2245
02:14:19,060 --> 02:14:20,260
I'm number 17.

2246
02:14:20,260 --> 02:14:21,619
You guys already do the interviews?

2247
02:14:22,819 --> 02:14:23,619
Yes, we did.

2248
02:14:23,619 --> 02:14:24,100
You weren't here.

2249
02:14:25,739 --> 02:14:26,699
Shit.

2250
02:14:26,699 --> 02:14:27,100
Yeah.

2251
02:14:28,060 --> 02:14:29,100
You were not available.

2252
02:14:29,100 --> 02:14:30,300
So we just kind of caught you.

2253
02:14:30,300 --> 02:14:31,020
So sorry, dude.

2254
02:14:31,659 --> 02:14:32,699
Are you watching right now?

2255
02:14:32,699 --> 02:14:34,060
Do you see who's on stage right now?

2256
02:14:36,949 --> 02:14:40,149
Listen, I'll just be real.

2257
02:14:40,149 --> 02:14:40,470
Yeah.

2258
02:14:40,470 --> 02:14:42,470
It doesn't even fucking matter who you guys pick

2259
02:14:42,470 --> 02:14:46,470
because all the plus twos are chat memes nowadays.

2260
02:14:46,470 --> 02:14:47,109
Yeah.

2261
02:14:47,109 --> 02:14:49,510
So where's the test to see which of these contestants

2262
02:14:49,510 --> 02:14:51,350
can pick the correct one guy comment?

2263
02:14:52,229 --> 02:14:52,710
Interesting.

2264
02:14:54,869 --> 02:14:55,350
Okay.

2265
02:14:55,350 --> 02:14:57,909
Well, so you're asking if he can pick

2266
02:14:58,390 --> 02:14:59,750
one guy comment out of chat

2267
02:14:59,750 --> 02:15:01,510
and that should be able to fix if he can do it?

2268
02:15:03,289 --> 02:15:03,689
Yeah.

2269
02:15:03,689 --> 02:15:07,289
I mean, pretty simple, just breaking it out.

2270
02:15:07,289 --> 02:15:08,729
Number nine, I got a question for you.

2271
02:15:08,729 --> 02:15:09,369
Yes.

2272
02:15:09,369 --> 02:15:11,609
So there's three comments in chat.

2273
02:15:11,609 --> 02:15:14,090
One of them says, you're a loser.

2274
02:15:14,090 --> 02:15:18,010
The second one says, hey, like shit into a bedpan

2275
02:15:18,010 --> 02:15:19,289
and show it on stream.

2276
02:15:19,289 --> 02:15:22,010
And the third person says, hey, Jerma,

2277
02:15:22,010 --> 02:15:23,609
you should play Destiny 2 PVP.

2278
02:15:23,609 --> 02:15:24,489
Which one are you going to read?

2279
02:15:25,529 --> 02:15:27,130
I'm going to go with number three.

2280
02:15:27,130 --> 02:15:28,329
I'm going to take that advice

2281
02:15:29,529 --> 02:15:31,609
and let the haters build me up.

2282
02:15:31,609 --> 02:15:32,970
That's very, very good idea.

2283
02:15:32,970 --> 02:15:33,609
Very good idea.

2284
02:15:33,609 --> 02:15:33,770
Thank you.

2285
02:15:33,770 --> 02:15:34,329
Very good idea.

2286
02:15:35,210 --> 02:15:35,689
It's Alex.

2287
02:15:35,689 --> 02:15:37,449
Thank you so much for the input.

2288
02:15:38,010 --> 02:15:39,449
But I think we have our decision here.

2289
02:15:39,449 --> 02:15:40,090
One last thing.

2290
02:15:40,090 --> 02:15:40,489
Okay.

2291
02:15:40,489 --> 02:15:40,810
Yeah.

2292
02:15:41,529 --> 02:15:43,460
I just want to say I've been watching

2293
02:15:44,520 --> 02:15:45,960
and I can't tell them apart

2294
02:15:45,960 --> 02:15:47,880
because I think the ultimate test should be

2295
02:15:47,880 --> 02:15:50,279
who looks the best wearing a chest brace

2296
02:15:51,560 --> 02:15:52,439
playing VR.

2297
02:15:52,439 --> 02:15:54,760
So if you could just get one of those on stage right now.

2298
02:15:54,760 --> 02:15:55,159
Hang up.

2299
02:15:55,159 --> 02:15:56,199
I hang up on him.

2300
02:15:56,199 --> 02:15:56,680
Hang up on him.

2301
02:15:56,680 --> 02:15:57,399
Call is breaking up.

2302
02:15:57,399 --> 02:15:58,039
I can't hear.

2303
02:15:58,119 --> 02:15:58,680
Hang up on him.

2304
02:15:59,399 --> 02:16:00,520
I couldn't hear anything.

2305
02:16:00,520 --> 02:16:01,560
I couldn't hear anything.

2306
02:16:01,560 --> 02:16:02,920
I'm a size medium if that matters.

2307
02:16:03,479 --> 02:16:04,680
No one was talking to you.

2308
02:16:04,680 --> 02:16:05,159
Be clear.

2309
02:16:08,760 --> 02:16:11,000
With that input, I think he goes through.

2310
02:16:11,960 --> 02:16:13,960
You like the picking the Destiny 2 comment?

2311
02:16:13,960 --> 02:16:16,039
I think he's got what it takes.

2312
02:16:16,760 --> 02:16:18,039
I'm just asking questions.

2313
02:16:18,039 --> 02:16:20,199
Can you do a little word play with me?

2314
02:16:20,199 --> 02:16:21,159
Yes, of course.

2315
02:16:21,159 --> 02:16:22,199
I want you to finish.

2316
02:16:22,199 --> 02:16:24,279
I'm going to say a word and you say a second word.

2317
02:16:24,279 --> 02:16:24,840
Okay.

2318
02:16:24,840 --> 02:16:25,640
Doll.

2319
02:16:25,640 --> 02:16:26,279
House.

2320
02:16:26,279 --> 02:16:26,920
Cat.

2321
02:16:26,920 --> 02:16:27,239
Mouse.

2322
02:16:27,239 --> 02:16:28,119
One for two.

2323
02:16:28,119 --> 02:16:28,600
There it is.

2324
02:16:28,600 --> 02:16:29,239
Bingo.

2325
02:16:29,239 --> 02:16:29,800
You can go on.

2326
02:16:29,800 --> 02:16:30,359
Bingo.

2327
02:16:30,359 --> 02:16:31,800
Number nine, you're moving on to the next round.

2328
02:16:31,800 --> 02:16:32,440
Thank you so much.

2329
02:16:32,440 --> 02:16:33,000
Thank you so much.

2330
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:33,639
I won't let you down.

2331
02:16:33,639 --> 02:16:34,040
Thank you.

2332
02:16:34,040 --> 02:16:34,600
Thank you.

2333
02:16:34,600 --> 02:16:36,120
Somebody, the audio sucks.

2334
02:16:36,120 --> 02:16:37,319
I don't know what happened.

2335
02:16:37,319 --> 02:16:38,600
Did the call break up?

2336
02:16:39,159 --> 02:16:40,040
I'm so sorry.

2337
02:16:40,040 --> 02:16:40,840
I'm so sorry.

2338
02:16:41,559 --> 02:16:42,520
Call broke up.

2339
02:16:42,520 --> 02:16:44,600
FMV game audio.

2340
02:16:44,600 --> 02:16:45,319
Right?

2341
02:16:45,319 --> 02:16:46,920
You're reading that one guy comment.

2342
02:16:46,920 --> 02:16:48,200
That was literally one guy.

2343
02:16:48,200 --> 02:16:49,479
There was only one guy.

2344
02:16:49,479 --> 02:16:51,079
That was like a hundred guys.

2345
02:16:51,079 --> 02:16:53,000
I'm pretty sure in between all that I heard like

2346
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:53,959
Jerma is great.

2347
02:16:53,959 --> 02:16:55,399
Jerma is doing fantastic.

2348
02:16:55,399 --> 02:16:56,600
And then you read the comment.

2349
02:16:56,680 --> 02:16:58,280
And then you read the one audio is messed up.

2350
02:16:58,280 --> 02:17:00,200
This guy wants us to play Destiny 2.

2351
02:17:00,200 --> 02:17:03,930
Destiny 2, I can't get a close up here.

2352
02:17:03,930 --> 02:17:10,389
I will never, ever, ever play Destiny 2 PVP ever.

2353
02:17:11,190 --> 02:17:14,139
It's never.

2354
02:17:14,139 --> 02:17:16,379
What are you doing?

2355
02:17:16,379 --> 02:17:17,739
He said he's like crawling over.

2356
02:17:20,459 --> 02:17:20,860
Okay.

2357
02:17:21,500 --> 02:17:22,780
Can we send the next person in please?

2358
02:17:23,579 --> 02:17:24,139
Number 10.

2359
02:17:24,780 --> 02:17:25,340
Number 10.

2360
02:17:25,340 --> 02:17:25,819
Number 10.

2361
02:17:25,819 --> 02:17:26,540
Double digits.

2362
02:17:28,440 --> 02:17:29,879
Oh, hey.

2363
02:17:30,440 --> 02:17:30,920
Yeah.

2364
02:17:32,280 --> 02:17:34,680
Okay.

2365
02:17:34,680 --> 02:17:35,239
That was cool.

2366
02:17:35,239 --> 02:17:37,079
I like that.

2367
02:17:37,079 --> 02:17:37,719
That was cool.

2368
02:17:37,719 --> 02:17:38,440
That was pretty cool.

2369
02:17:39,399 --> 02:17:40,360
Where are you from?

2370
02:17:40,360 --> 02:17:42,200
Oh, I'm from San Francisco.

2371
02:17:42,200 --> 02:17:43,159
You have a microphone.

2372
02:17:43,719 --> 02:17:44,040
Fuck me.

2373
02:17:44,040 --> 02:17:45,959
So I'm from San Francisco, born and raised.

2374
02:17:45,959 --> 02:17:46,600
Great.

2375
02:17:46,600 --> 02:17:49,639
So from San Francisco, from the town of Bay.

2376
02:17:49,639 --> 02:17:50,360
That's right.

2377
02:17:50,360 --> 02:17:55,719
So you're here to replace me, of course, ultimately, right?

2378
02:17:55,719 --> 02:17:56,200
Yes.

2379
02:17:56,200 --> 02:17:57,959
Only out of pure admiration though.

2380
02:17:57,959 --> 02:17:58,280
Okay.

2381
02:17:58,280 --> 02:17:58,520
Cool.

2382
02:17:58,520 --> 02:17:59,239
It's your time to retire.

2383
02:17:59,239 --> 02:18:01,079
I feel like I can ask you a few questions.

2384
02:18:01,079 --> 02:18:01,879
We all feel it.

2385
02:18:01,879 --> 02:18:02,360
Please.

2386
02:18:02,360 --> 02:18:04,520
Would you ever play VR games?

2387
02:18:07,319 --> 02:18:08,520
Yes.

2388
02:18:08,520 --> 02:18:10,680
Would you ever play Destiny 2 PVP?

2389
02:18:10,680 --> 02:18:11,719
No.

2390
02:18:11,719 --> 02:18:12,120
Okay.

2391
02:18:12,120 --> 02:18:12,440
Good.

2392
02:18:12,440 --> 02:18:12,920
Good answer.

2393
02:18:14,440 --> 02:18:15,479
One more question, sir.

2394
02:18:15,479 --> 02:18:16,040
Yes, doctor.

2395
02:18:18,520 --> 02:18:27,020
What is your blood pressure?

2396
02:18:27,020 --> 02:18:29,819
And I'm warning you, that's a trick question.

2397
02:18:33,100 --> 02:18:37,020
Uh, my blood pressure is absolutely excellent.

2398
02:18:37,020 --> 02:18:40,219
It's the healthiest blood pressure I think anyone has ever recorded.

2399
02:18:40,219 --> 02:18:41,260
It's a good Donald Trump.

2400
02:18:41,260 --> 02:18:41,979
Up until today.

2401
02:18:42,860 --> 02:18:44,139
My blood pressure is excellent.

2402
02:18:44,139 --> 02:18:47,180
The healthiest president I've seen in my life.

2403
02:18:47,180 --> 02:18:47,500
Okay.

2404
02:18:47,500 --> 02:18:49,899
So number 10, what are you going to do for us today?

2405
02:18:49,899 --> 02:18:55,100
Well, I have this talent that I developed into a skill over the last handful of years.

2406
02:18:55,100 --> 02:18:56,620
It all began one day.

2407
02:18:56,620 --> 02:19:01,180
I was in an absolute delirium and I demanded

2408
02:19:01,180 --> 02:19:05,180
for my friends to feed me coffee, Cheetos, and chicken.

2409
02:19:05,180 --> 02:19:07,659
And afterward, I completely lost my mind.

2410
02:19:07,659 --> 02:19:10,059
I went into a fugue state for the next couple of minutes.

2411
02:19:10,059 --> 02:19:10,459
Sure.

2412
02:19:10,459 --> 02:19:14,459
And I found out that this is what I did and I'd like to show you now.

2413
02:19:14,459 --> 02:19:14,780
Thank you.

2414
02:19:14,780 --> 02:19:15,260
Okay.

2415
02:19:15,260 --> 02:19:16,459
Just need a few minutes.

2416
02:19:16,459 --> 02:19:17,100
Sure.

2417
02:19:17,100 --> 02:19:18,219
Take as much time as you need.

2418
02:19:18,219 --> 02:19:20,139
So he's doing what he did in a fugue state.

2419
02:19:20,139 --> 02:19:20,780
In a fugue state.

2420
02:19:20,780 --> 02:19:21,979
But no longer in a fugue state.

2421
02:19:21,979 --> 02:19:22,860
Dr. Schmuckson, what's a fugue state?

2422
02:19:22,860 --> 02:19:23,579
Take it off.

2423
02:19:23,579 --> 02:19:24,299
What's a fugue state?

2424
02:19:24,299 --> 02:19:24,780
Let's go.

2425
02:19:26,139 --> 02:19:30,299
It's one of those states where it's kind of purposeful.

2426
02:19:30,299 --> 02:19:31,659
He's getting naked, actually.

2427
02:19:31,659 --> 02:19:33,100
What is he doing?

2428
02:19:33,100 --> 02:19:34,170
What?

2429
02:19:34,170 --> 02:19:34,729
What are you doing?

2430
02:19:34,729 --> 02:19:35,610
Can you take your shirt off?

2431
02:19:35,610 --> 02:19:36,329
His shirt's off.

2432
02:19:37,209 --> 02:19:40,040
What the fuck are you doing?

2433
02:19:46,340 --> 02:19:47,620
That's probably so loud.

2434
02:19:50,260 --> 02:19:51,379
This is your talent?

2435
02:19:55,459 --> 02:19:56,579
You're doing great.

2436
02:19:56,579 --> 02:19:57,860
It's a skill I made.

2437
02:19:57,860 --> 02:19:59,700
So what exactly are you doing?

2438
02:19:59,700 --> 02:20:00,180
It's obvious.

2439
02:20:00,180 --> 02:20:02,020
Well, if you pay close enough attention,

2440
02:20:02,020 --> 02:20:04,180
can I actually get a camera close up here?

2441
02:20:04,180 --> 02:20:05,780
If you pay close enough attention,

2442
02:20:06,340 --> 02:20:10,100
you can see the fat from my luscious love handles

2443
02:20:10,100 --> 02:20:12,899
actually sticking to the wood as I press down

2444
02:20:12,899 --> 02:20:14,500
and then as I come up from the mid-back.

2445
02:20:15,379 --> 02:20:15,860
Interesting.

2446
02:20:15,860 --> 02:20:17,620
It takes a lot of confidence to come on stage

2447
02:20:17,620 --> 02:20:19,139
and know the wood was correct for this.

2448
02:20:19,139 --> 02:20:22,979
It takes a lot of confidence to test your shirt off on stage.

2449
02:20:23,620 --> 02:20:24,340
Let's be honest.

2450
02:20:24,340 --> 02:20:26,100
And that's what I have for you today.

2451
02:20:26,100 --> 02:20:26,659
Wow.

2452
02:20:26,659 --> 02:20:27,540
That's it.

2453
02:20:27,540 --> 02:20:28,340
I'm floored.

2454
02:20:28,340 --> 02:20:29,299
Great job, number 10.

2455
02:20:29,299 --> 02:20:30,600
Thank you very much.

2456
02:20:30,600 --> 02:20:31,079
Very nice.

2457
02:20:31,079 --> 02:20:32,280
You can put your shirt back on.

2458
02:20:32,280 --> 02:20:32,760
Thank you.

2459
02:20:32,760 --> 02:20:34,280
Number 10, thank you so much for your time.

2460
02:20:34,920 --> 02:20:35,959
I'm going to know on this one

2461
02:20:35,959 --> 02:20:37,719
because I think that was just revolting and disgusting.

2462
02:20:37,719 --> 02:20:39,559
I would never do something like that in my life.

2463
02:20:39,559 --> 02:20:42,280
I don't want the next Jerma985 to be like lying on the ground

2464
02:20:42,280 --> 02:20:43,319
and farting in camera.

2465
02:20:43,319 --> 02:20:43,959
I think it was revolting.

2466
02:20:43,959 --> 02:20:46,760
I think with the hot tub meta coming up and rising,

2467
02:20:46,760 --> 02:20:49,079
we're going to need some more of this bravado.

2468
02:20:49,639 --> 02:20:52,040
Some more of like a more sexual comedy Jerma

2469
02:20:52,040 --> 02:20:53,239
I've been looking for for years.

2470
02:20:53,239 --> 02:20:54,120
More blue humor.

2471
02:20:55,239 --> 02:20:58,440
I feel like in the dollhouse, you publicly shit yourself.

2472
02:20:59,319 --> 02:21:00,440
But you're above that.

2473
02:21:02,139 --> 02:21:04,219
I mean, I don't take my clothes off like on stream.

2474
02:21:04,299 --> 02:21:05,020
It's fair.

2475
02:21:05,020 --> 02:21:06,739
Schmikeson, do we have any input from you?

2476
02:21:06,739 --> 02:21:09,139
I'm a little conflicted on this one, guys.

2477
02:21:12,520 --> 02:21:17,079
Physically, that was ridiculous enough that you could be Jerma.

2478
02:21:17,879 --> 02:21:19,719
However, I was a little, I mean,

2479
02:21:20,760 --> 02:21:24,280
watching things kind of squish, make squish noises on the floor.

2480
02:21:24,280 --> 02:21:27,879
I just have to say I'm conflicted.

2481
02:21:30,360 --> 02:21:31,319
Doctor, I'm with you here.

2482
02:21:31,879 --> 02:21:34,600
I'm not as set in stone as Ster seems to be.

2483
02:21:34,920 --> 02:21:35,719
I don't know.

2484
02:21:35,719 --> 02:21:37,559
I think that I wouldn't do something like that.

2485
02:21:37,559 --> 02:21:37,799
All right.

2486
02:21:37,799 --> 02:21:39,719
Don't you think there's like something maybe he could do

2487
02:21:40,780 --> 02:21:45,850
after the show to convince you to fart in front of him?

2488
02:21:45,850 --> 02:21:47,290
What are you talking about?

2489
02:21:48,969 --> 02:21:50,250
Fart in the parking lot?

2490
02:21:50,969 --> 02:21:52,010
There's a lot of that mean.

2491
02:21:53,049 --> 02:21:53,930
What is that supposed to mean?

2492
02:21:53,930 --> 02:21:55,770
Like he's going to fart in the parking lot in front of him?

2493
02:21:55,770 --> 02:21:56,729
Like fart in his face?

2494
02:21:56,729 --> 02:21:58,409
This is a final kind of test for me.

2495
02:21:59,049 --> 02:22:02,329
I want you to imagine you're a substitute teacher

2496
02:22:03,290 --> 02:22:04,889
and the kids are getting rowdy.

2497
02:22:05,850 --> 02:22:08,329
Make a noise to have them silence down.

2498
02:22:08,329 --> 02:22:08,969
The floor is yours.

2499
02:22:08,969 --> 02:22:09,690
You have a few seconds.

2500
02:22:09,690 --> 02:22:10,809
It's a good call, Ludwig.

2501
02:22:17,370 --> 02:22:18,329
I'm pulling mine back.

2502
02:22:19,209 --> 02:22:20,170
I'm pulling mine back.

2503
02:22:20,170 --> 02:22:20,670
Whoa.

2504
02:22:21,930 --> 02:22:23,610
Jerma, don't you think that this would be an...

2505
02:22:24,409 --> 02:22:25,610
I don't have to convince you anymore.

2506
02:22:25,610 --> 02:22:27,290
The rest of you, this would be an important skill

2507
02:22:27,290 --> 02:22:29,530
for a Jerma to have if you were going to go to a water park.

2508
02:22:29,530 --> 02:22:30,489
I don't think you have to convince anyone.

2509
02:22:30,489 --> 02:22:32,889
There's only one X right now.

2510
02:22:32,889 --> 02:22:33,850
He pulled back as well.

2511
02:22:33,850 --> 02:22:36,729
Oh, oh, great job.

2512
02:22:38,010 --> 02:22:38,569
You're on.

2513
02:22:38,569 --> 02:22:40,010
Leave before they disagree.

2514
02:22:40,010 --> 02:22:41,770
You have made it through the next round.

2515
02:22:41,770 --> 02:22:42,489
Thank you, number 10.

2516
02:22:42,489 --> 02:22:43,850
Very, very nice farting sounds.

2517
02:22:43,850 --> 02:22:44,809
Appreciate it, gentlemen.

2518
02:22:44,809 --> 02:22:45,450
Back to the big time.

2519
02:22:45,450 --> 02:22:46,329
Have a great day.

2520
02:22:46,329 --> 02:22:47,370
Back to the big time.

2521
02:22:47,370 --> 02:22:47,930
Back to the big time.

2522
02:22:47,930 --> 02:22:49,209
No, wait, I'm out.

2523
02:22:49,209 --> 02:22:49,690
We're good?

2524
02:22:49,690 --> 02:22:50,170
We're good.

2525
02:22:50,170 --> 02:22:50,809
We're good.

2526
02:22:50,809 --> 02:22:51,290
We're good?

2527
02:22:51,290 --> 02:22:51,930
We're good.

2528
02:22:51,930 --> 02:22:52,969
That was tough.

2529
02:22:52,969 --> 02:22:54,250
You're just a bit tall, I thought.

2530
02:22:54,250 --> 02:22:54,969
You think it's too tall?

2531
02:22:54,969 --> 02:22:55,469
Yeah.

2532
02:22:56,420 --> 02:22:57,219
I'm a smidge.

2533
02:22:58,260 --> 02:23:00,500
I mean, I'm 5'7", 5'8", with shoes.

2534
02:23:00,500 --> 02:23:01,620
You're 5'7".

2535
02:23:01,620 --> 02:23:03,219
I'm 5'8", with shoes.

2536
02:23:03,219 --> 02:23:05,700
But you can't say I'm 5'7", 5'8", and then throw it with shoes.

2537
02:23:05,780 --> 02:23:08,500
I feel like you can round up to 6'.

2538
02:23:09,379 --> 02:23:10,579
Gentlemen, we've been over this.

2539
02:23:10,579 --> 02:23:11,459
We've been over this.

2540
02:23:11,459 --> 02:23:14,420
Doctor, you've measured my height a dozen times.

2541
02:23:14,420 --> 02:23:15,059
Yes, I have.

2542
02:23:15,059 --> 02:23:16,180
How tall am I actually?

2543
02:23:16,180 --> 02:23:16,979
I don't know.

2544
02:23:16,979 --> 02:23:18,579
You will never take your shoes off.

2545
02:23:18,579 --> 02:23:21,700
So, you know, it doesn't make that easy.

2546
02:23:21,700 --> 02:23:24,979
When you're measuring someone's height and you have to submit it in the record.

2547
02:23:24,979 --> 02:23:25,459
You're my doctor.

2548
02:23:25,459 --> 02:23:26,500
Can you do it with shoes?

2549
02:23:27,940 --> 02:23:30,579
You can ordinarily do it with shoes,

2550
02:23:30,579 --> 02:23:35,860
but say there's something that is kind of hiding from us.

2551
02:23:36,420 --> 02:23:37,219
In the shoes.

2552
02:23:37,219 --> 02:23:37,860
Oh!

2553
02:23:37,860 --> 02:23:40,819
Okay, but how tall am I, doctor, with shoes?

2554
02:23:40,819 --> 02:23:42,020
What's in the shoes, Jerma?

2555
02:23:42,020 --> 02:23:42,579
Nothing, just shoes.

2556
02:23:42,579 --> 02:23:43,700
What's in the shoes?

2557
02:23:43,700 --> 02:23:45,459
What's in the damn shoes, Jerma?

2558
02:23:45,459 --> 02:23:48,899
Well, you guys, why is this such a weird, like, persecution bullshit?

2559
02:23:48,899 --> 02:23:49,860
I have shoes on.

2560
02:23:49,860 --> 02:23:51,780
I've dressed, I wear dress shoes to the doctor.

2561
02:23:51,780 --> 02:23:52,340
Is that weird?

2562
02:23:53,540 --> 02:23:53,620
Kind of, yeah.

2563
02:23:53,620 --> 02:23:55,059
To make sure I'm over 5'8", and a half.

2564
02:23:55,620 --> 02:23:56,819
I'm cringing.

2565
02:23:56,819 --> 02:23:57,620
No, you're not.

2566
02:23:57,620 --> 02:23:58,340
You would go like this.

2567
02:23:59,399 --> 02:24:00,440
I'm pogging.

2568
02:24:00,440 --> 02:24:00,920
There we go.

2569
02:24:01,719 --> 02:24:02,520
You're pogging about his feet?

2570
02:24:02,520 --> 02:24:03,559
5'8", with shoes.

2571
02:24:03,559 --> 02:24:04,840
You can say that whenever you want.

2572
02:24:04,840 --> 02:24:05,559
All right, anyways.

2573
02:24:06,440 --> 02:24:07,239
5'8", with shoes.

2574
02:24:08,600 --> 02:24:09,639
Another piano?

2575
02:24:10,520 --> 02:24:11,959
There's only been two pianos.

2576
02:24:11,959 --> 02:24:13,319
It's not like it's been, like, all day.

2577
02:24:15,319 --> 02:24:17,159
Not the second piano for the whole day.

2578
02:24:17,159 --> 02:24:19,079
This is going to have to be better than other piano.

2579
02:24:19,079 --> 02:24:20,440
Now, that's what I call music.

2580
02:24:21,799 --> 02:24:22,760
It's number 11, right?

2581
02:24:22,760 --> 02:24:23,959
This is 11, yeah.

2582
02:24:23,959 --> 02:24:24,680
Big one, one.

2583
02:24:25,399 --> 02:24:27,319
Number 11, if you're ready to come out, we're ready to see you.

2584
02:24:30,200 --> 02:24:31,239
Hello, number 11.

2585
02:24:31,239 --> 02:24:31,739
Hey.

2586
02:24:34,899 --> 02:24:36,100
How are you guys?

2587
02:24:36,100 --> 02:24:36,659
Very good.

2588
02:24:37,219 --> 02:24:39,940
I noticed your Dark Souls Play 3 didn't really know what you were doing.

2589
02:24:39,940 --> 02:24:41,780
Hopefully, you know what you're doing with the piano.

2590
02:24:41,780 --> 02:24:42,819
I sure hope so, too, yeah.

2591
02:24:42,819 --> 02:24:43,780
I hope so, too, yeah.

2592
02:24:44,340 --> 02:24:45,940
What are you going to do for us, number 11?

2593
02:24:46,739 --> 02:24:50,420
Well, I'm actually going to play you a ballad, a nice, pretty song.

2594
02:24:50,420 --> 02:24:50,819
Okay.

2595
02:24:50,819 --> 02:24:51,860
Thought I'd change it up a little bit.

2596
02:24:51,860 --> 02:24:52,979
Can I ask you a question?

2597
02:24:52,979 --> 02:24:53,620
Of course.

2598
02:24:53,620 --> 02:24:57,059
If you were hungry late at night, what would you order for McDonald's?

2599
02:24:57,059 --> 02:24:57,620
Oh, boy.

2600
02:24:57,620 --> 02:24:58,180
This is big.

2601
02:24:58,739 --> 02:25:00,020
I have a signature.

2602
02:25:00,020 --> 02:25:02,819
McChicken Plains, small fries, snack size, M&M McFlurry.

2603
02:25:03,459 --> 02:25:03,780
Wow.

2604
02:25:03,780 --> 02:25:04,659
M&M McFlurry, that's pretty good.

2605
02:25:04,659 --> 02:25:06,020
Just enough calories to pass.

2606
02:25:06,260 --> 02:25:06,979
Exactly, right?

2607
02:25:08,979 --> 02:25:09,940
Well, go ahead, please.

2608
02:25:09,940 --> 02:25:12,420
Yeah, we're really excited to see your piano work.

2609
02:25:14,020 --> 02:25:16,340
I love how it's calorie count, not like, okay.

2610
02:25:17,379 --> 02:25:19,590
So what song are you going to do for us, number 11?

2611
02:25:19,590 --> 02:25:20,309
He already-

2612
02:25:20,309 --> 02:25:20,950
It's a ballad.

2613
02:25:20,950 --> 02:25:21,670
It's a ballad.

2614
02:25:21,670 --> 02:25:22,549
What ballad?

2615
02:25:22,549 --> 02:25:23,510
We need to know.

2616
02:25:23,510 --> 02:25:24,629
It's a ballad.

2617
02:25:24,629 --> 02:25:24,950
A ballad?

2618
02:25:24,950 --> 02:25:26,389
The music speaks for itself.

2619
02:25:27,430 --> 02:25:27,909
Focus.

2620
02:25:27,909 --> 02:25:29,750
Can you look at a rash on my back a little?

2621
02:25:30,950 --> 02:25:33,510
It's called a strange room.

2622
02:25:33,510 --> 02:25:34,469
A strange room, okay.

2623
02:25:45,020 --> 02:25:45,819
No, wait, no, no!

2624
02:25:46,379 --> 02:25:46,620
What?

2625
02:25:47,260 --> 02:25:48,469
Did you just get the shit out of me?

2626
02:25:48,469 --> 02:25:48,629
No.

2627
02:25:48,629 --> 02:25:48,950
What are you doing?

2628
02:25:48,950 --> 02:25:49,670
It's nothing.

2629
02:25:49,670 --> 02:25:50,389
And he kept going.

2630
02:25:50,389 --> 02:25:51,190
That's really good.

2631
02:25:51,190 --> 02:25:51,989
That's big.

2632
02:25:51,989 --> 02:25:52,790
That actually-

2633
02:25:52,790 --> 02:25:54,149
You tried to fuck him up.

2634
02:25:54,149 --> 02:25:54,629
Didn't work.

2635
02:25:55,670 --> 02:25:57,510
Don't you press that button, I'll be pissed.

2636
02:25:58,950 --> 02:25:59,989
Not again, okay?

2637
02:26:28,139 --> 02:26:34,540
Church that plays the good.

2638
02:26:50,659 --> 02:26:51,379
That was a good finish.

2639
02:26:51,379 --> 02:26:52,739
No, pull it back.

2640
02:26:52,739 --> 02:26:53,299
Pull it back.

2641
02:26:53,299 --> 02:26:54,340
That was unfair.

2642
02:26:54,340 --> 02:26:55,059
Convince me.

2643
02:26:55,620 --> 02:26:57,940
Stop with the making me make my decisions, Danny.

2644
02:26:57,940 --> 02:26:58,739
Okay, listen.

2645
02:26:58,739 --> 02:26:59,700
Did everybody-

2646
02:26:59,700 --> 02:27:00,100
What the fuck?

2647
02:27:00,100 --> 02:27:00,979
We all buzzed.

2648
02:27:00,979 --> 02:27:02,260
Can I ask you a couple questions?

2649
02:27:03,379 --> 02:27:04,500
Where did you serve your mission?

2650
02:27:05,780 --> 02:27:11,700
You know, it's so funny you say that because I'm actually ex-Mormon.

2651
02:27:11,700 --> 02:27:14,180
Ah, yeah, I spotted it.

2652
02:27:14,180 --> 02:27:14,899
You spotted it?

2653
02:27:14,899 --> 02:27:15,780
I spotted it.

2654
02:27:15,780 --> 02:27:16,659
How do you spot something like that?

2655
02:27:16,659 --> 02:27:17,780
It's obvious, Jerma.

2656
02:27:17,780 --> 02:27:19,059
I'm white and I play piano.

2657
02:27:19,059 --> 02:27:20,340
I think that's a dead-game.

2658
02:27:20,340 --> 02:27:21,459
He said the word church, too.

2659
02:27:23,139 --> 02:27:23,780
It's not a church.

2660
02:27:24,500 --> 02:27:26,100
Ah, is it not?

2661
02:27:26,100 --> 02:27:26,420
No.

2662
02:27:26,420 --> 02:27:28,100
It's an original?

2663
02:27:28,100 --> 02:27:29,700
It's a cover by my favorite band.

2664
02:27:30,659 --> 02:27:32,180
When did you leave the church?

2665
02:27:32,180 --> 02:27:33,059
I thought that was really good.

2666
02:27:33,780 --> 02:27:34,899
When I turned 18.

2667
02:27:35,379 --> 02:27:36,899
Don't put 20 questions in the box.

2668
02:27:36,899 --> 02:27:37,700
It's just a couple.

2669
02:27:37,700 --> 02:27:39,059
It's not that big of a deal.

2670
02:27:39,059 --> 02:27:40,180
No more questions?

2671
02:27:40,180 --> 02:27:41,139
No more questions?

2672
02:27:41,139 --> 02:27:42,020
No more questions?

2673
02:27:42,020 --> 02:27:43,139
I do have a question.

2674
02:27:44,979 --> 02:27:48,579
That doesn't really relate to what the others have been talking about,

2675
02:27:48,579 --> 02:27:50,899
but could you do that standing on your head?

2676
02:27:54,819 --> 02:27:57,379
Actually, yeah, in Amadeus, how he does it turned over.

2677
02:27:57,379 --> 02:27:58,260
Can we get some of that?

2678
02:28:00,329 --> 02:28:00,889
I don't-

2679
02:28:00,889 --> 02:28:02,729
Listen, I'm the only one that didn't say no.

2680
02:28:03,370 --> 02:28:04,489
I thought that was phenomenal.

2681
02:28:04,489 --> 02:28:05,530
I thought you did a great job.

2682
02:28:06,250 --> 02:28:08,729
I don't listen to any of these jokers.

2683
02:28:08,729 --> 02:28:09,850
I thought that was great.

2684
02:28:09,850 --> 02:28:10,409
Well, thank you.

2685
02:28:11,209 --> 02:28:12,170
You know what my problem is?

2686
02:28:13,049 --> 02:28:14,969
He's absolutely delightful.

2687
02:28:14,969 --> 02:28:15,290
Yeah.

2688
02:28:15,290 --> 02:28:16,250
A pleasure to be around.

2689
02:28:16,250 --> 02:28:17,530
Want to know what my problem is?

2690
02:28:17,530 --> 02:28:18,649
That doesn't work, right?

2691
02:28:18,649 --> 02:28:19,530
Second piano guy.

2692
02:28:20,569 --> 02:28:21,450
Well, I think that's unfair.

2693
02:28:21,450 --> 02:28:23,450
You can't play a piano more than one-

2694
02:28:23,450 --> 02:28:25,209
The 16 people stir.

2695
02:28:25,209 --> 02:28:26,649
There's so many instruments.

2696
02:28:26,649 --> 02:28:30,569
I just feel like you're riding the coattails of the success you saw from the backstage.

2697
02:28:31,610 --> 02:28:33,690
Anybody changing their vote or is this it?

2698
02:28:33,690 --> 02:28:36,870
I think he's too sweet.

2699
02:28:38,069 --> 02:28:40,549
Number 11, you're apparently too nice of a person.

2700
02:28:40,549 --> 02:28:44,469
You're too good and nice of a person to take the moniker of Meade,

2701
02:28:44,469 --> 02:28:47,750
who is also a nice person, who tries to be nice to everybody

2702
02:28:47,750 --> 02:28:51,110
and be cool to his friends and his doctor and everything and have fun with him and stuff.

2703
02:28:51,110 --> 02:28:52,870
Don't listen to all of that, please.

2704
02:28:54,309 --> 02:28:54,950
Okay.

2705
02:28:54,950 --> 02:28:55,989
Number 11, I'm so sorry.

2706
02:28:57,590 --> 02:28:58,790
I wanted you.

2707
02:28:58,790 --> 02:29:01,430
Please go live a fantastic, healthy life.

2708
02:29:01,430 --> 02:29:01,930
That's right.

2709
02:29:02,950 --> 02:29:04,069
Number 11, thank you so much.

2710
02:29:04,069 --> 02:29:05,350
Sword to the stars.

2711
02:29:05,350 --> 02:29:06,629
That's unfortunate.

2712
02:29:06,629 --> 02:29:07,909
I thought he had what it took.

2713
02:29:07,909 --> 02:29:08,629
Apparently not.

2714
02:29:08,629 --> 02:29:10,709
I didn't want to ruin a young boy's life.

2715
02:29:11,829 --> 02:29:13,270
I thought he had what it took.

2716
02:29:13,270 --> 02:29:14,149
That's unfortunate.

2717
02:29:14,149 --> 02:29:16,709
I mean, look, because he was ex-Mormon, who cares?

2718
02:29:16,709 --> 02:29:18,469
I said it had nothing to do with the Mormon.

2719
02:29:18,469 --> 02:29:19,590
Oh, it definitely did.

2720
02:29:19,590 --> 02:29:21,030
It was because he was too sweet.

2721
02:29:21,030 --> 02:29:22,709
A year on Twitch, he'd be hitting the pipe.

2722
02:29:22,709 --> 02:29:23,510
I can't see him-

2723
02:29:25,909 --> 02:29:26,409
Wrong.

2724
02:29:27,590 --> 02:29:28,790
He's not unhinged enough.

2725
02:29:29,590 --> 02:29:33,190
Maybe he wasn't as unhinged, but maybe there's a new era of a nice-

2726
02:29:34,309 --> 02:29:36,549
That is not the new era.

2727
02:29:36,549 --> 02:29:37,430
You're way off.

2728
02:29:37,430 --> 02:29:39,270
We're going to play Animal Crossing today.

2729
02:29:39,270 --> 02:29:40,870
I played Animal Crossing when it came out.

2730
02:29:41,750 --> 02:29:47,180
That was the biggest mistake of your career.

2731
02:29:47,180 --> 02:29:47,739
No, it wasn't.

2732
02:29:47,739 --> 02:29:51,500
It's a fun, sweet, cute game with like animals and like the KK Slider goes like...

2733
02:29:53,020 --> 02:29:54,700
It's like, oh wow, what a fucking fun game.

2734
02:29:54,700 --> 02:29:56,540
That's exactly what you're doing right now.

2735
02:29:56,540 --> 02:29:56,860
What?

2736
02:29:56,860 --> 02:29:57,659
You think he's doing that?

2737
02:29:58,219 --> 02:29:59,020
He might.

2738
02:29:59,020 --> 02:30:00,860
No, he would be much more awesome at night.

2739
02:30:02,059 --> 02:30:02,860
Sorry, Professor.

2740
02:30:02,860 --> 02:30:03,500
Thank you.

2741
02:30:03,500 --> 02:30:04,620
He's a doctor, for God's sake.

2742
02:30:04,620 --> 02:30:06,059
Are they the same?

2743
02:30:06,059 --> 02:30:06,459
Are they the same?

2744
02:30:06,459 --> 02:30:07,340
He could be both.

2745
02:30:07,340 --> 02:30:07,979
Can you be both?

2746
02:30:07,979 --> 02:30:09,020
Are you a professor as well?

2747
02:30:10,379 --> 02:30:13,899
Yeah, actually, I am a professor as well.

2748
02:30:13,899 --> 02:30:15,340
That's true, technically.

2749
02:30:16,139 --> 02:30:17,180
What does technically mean?

2750
02:30:18,069 --> 02:30:21,829
Technically means a lot of different things and I don't choose to name them.

2751
02:30:21,829 --> 02:30:22,389
Okay.

2752
02:30:22,389 --> 02:30:22,950
All right.

2753
02:30:22,950 --> 02:30:24,309
He's a doctor, he's a professor, he's everything.

2754
02:30:24,309 --> 02:30:25,270
Are we playing 20 questions now?

2755
02:30:25,270 --> 02:30:25,989
So...

2756
02:30:25,989 --> 02:30:29,270
Yeah, I mean, you were going off on Ludwig for asking that guy questions.

2757
02:30:30,389 --> 02:30:31,670
He said it's definitely Ludwig.

2758
02:30:31,670 --> 02:30:33,110
You said his name wrong, by the way.

2759
02:30:33,110 --> 02:30:34,309
That's a fucking X, by the way.

2760
02:30:35,190 --> 02:30:36,149
I'm positive.

2761
02:30:36,629 --> 02:30:38,629
I looked you up on Wiki before this.

2762
02:30:38,629 --> 02:30:39,270
It's Ludwig.

2763
02:30:40,629 --> 02:30:41,670
He doesn't even know his own name.

2764
02:30:41,670 --> 02:30:42,629
I know it, though.

2765
02:30:42,629 --> 02:30:43,430
That's his name.

2766
02:30:43,430 --> 02:30:43,909
Ludwig.

2767
02:30:43,909 --> 02:30:46,549
Well, go on YouTube and there's like the pronounce, how to pronounce.

2768
02:30:46,549 --> 02:30:46,950
Yeah.

2769
02:30:46,950 --> 02:30:47,670
It's Ludwig.

2770
02:30:48,309 --> 02:30:49,590
But I don't go by that.

2771
02:30:49,590 --> 02:30:50,309
Ludwig.

2772
02:30:50,309 --> 02:30:50,870
Okay, you know how...

2773
02:30:50,870 --> 02:30:52,229
Just call him Ludwig, it's easy.

2774
02:30:53,110 --> 02:30:57,979
Who do we got coming up next?

2775
02:30:57,979 --> 02:30:59,020
Number 13, I believe.

2776
02:30:59,020 --> 02:30:59,500
Number 13?

2777
02:30:59,500 --> 02:31:00,700
Lucky number 13.

2778
02:31:00,700 --> 02:31:01,739
Number 13.

2779
02:31:01,739 --> 02:31:03,020
What do you got for us coming out here?

2780
02:31:05,110 --> 02:31:05,590
All right.

2781
02:31:07,989 --> 02:31:08,790
Nunchuck.

2782
02:31:08,950 --> 02:31:10,149
He's ready to go.

2783
02:31:10,149 --> 02:31:11,590
By the way, let's make it really clear.

2784
02:31:12,229 --> 02:31:14,229
The nearest hospital, are we going to find that?

2785
02:31:14,229 --> 02:31:15,590
Because he might hurt somebody.

2786
02:31:17,350 --> 02:31:18,790
Medical kit is in the back.

2787
02:31:19,829 --> 02:31:21,430
We do have a doctor right here in case...

2788
02:31:21,430 --> 02:31:22,389
On the eye.

2789
02:31:22,389 --> 02:31:25,110
If I feel it slipping, I tend not to let it hit myself.

2790
02:31:25,110 --> 02:31:25,909
I'd rather it go out.

2791
02:31:25,909 --> 02:31:27,190
Okay, so we should duck.

2792
02:31:27,190 --> 02:31:28,069
Oh, so...

2793
02:31:28,069 --> 02:31:30,149
You guys look like you have quick reflexes, though.

2794
02:31:30,629 --> 02:31:31,110
Quick enough.

2795
02:31:31,110 --> 02:31:31,510
Quick enough.

2796
02:31:31,510 --> 02:31:32,069
Yeah, yeah.

2797
02:31:32,069 --> 02:31:34,790
So are you going to do a routine with those nunchucks?

2798
02:31:34,790 --> 02:31:35,510
I'd like to.

2799
02:31:36,229 --> 02:31:37,190
Okay, so any back...

2800
02:31:37,190 --> 02:31:38,149
If it pleases the judges.

2801
02:31:38,149 --> 02:31:38,709
Any backstory?

2802
02:31:39,270 --> 02:31:40,389
You were the Russia guy.

2803
02:31:40,389 --> 02:31:42,709
You talked to us all about Russia and Tetris.

2804
02:31:42,709 --> 02:31:43,670
Oh, yes.

2805
02:31:44,709 --> 02:31:44,790
Well...

2806
02:31:44,790 --> 02:31:45,510
Did you forget...

2807
02:31:46,549 --> 02:31:48,149
Forget my Russian history?

2808
02:31:48,149 --> 02:31:48,709
What?

2809
02:31:48,709 --> 02:31:49,909
You had a...

2810
02:31:49,909 --> 02:31:50,870
It washed over you.

2811
02:31:50,870 --> 02:31:53,510
You forgot what you did in the previous segment.

2812
02:31:53,510 --> 02:31:57,190
No, he reminded me of my Russian history with Tetris.

2813
02:31:57,989 --> 02:32:01,030
My history with nunchucks is a lot more limited.

2814
02:32:01,030 --> 02:32:04,389
My grandma used to just call me the poor man's Bruce Lee when I was a kid.

2815
02:32:04,950 --> 02:32:06,149
She was off her meds a lot.

2816
02:32:06,149 --> 02:32:07,350
But I took it to heart.

2817
02:32:07,350 --> 02:32:11,750
And I decided to pick up the nunchucks in his honor.

2818
02:32:11,750 --> 02:32:12,149
Interesting.

2819
02:32:12,149 --> 02:32:12,870
Beautiful.

2820
02:32:12,870 --> 02:32:14,629
Yeah, so it's a thing that got to stay with me.

2821
02:32:15,190 --> 02:32:17,030
Have you ever hit yourself with the nuts with the nunchucks?

2822
02:32:17,030 --> 02:32:17,510
Yes.

2823
02:32:17,510 --> 02:32:17,829
Okay.

2824
02:32:17,829 --> 02:32:19,909
It's kind of a hazard.

2825
02:32:19,909 --> 02:32:20,790
It's gonna happen.

2826
02:32:20,790 --> 02:32:21,430
Was it comedic?

2827
02:32:21,430 --> 02:32:24,709
They tell you with motorcycles, if you ride long enough, you're gonna fall.

2828
02:32:24,709 --> 02:32:27,270
If you chuck long enough, you're gonna fall.

2829
02:32:27,270 --> 02:32:29,670
Were there more than three people in the room that thought it was funny?

2830
02:32:31,590 --> 02:32:32,790
Only alone, yeah.

2831
02:32:32,790 --> 02:32:35,030
I like to do really unsafe stuff when I'm alone.

2832
02:32:35,030 --> 02:32:35,510
Yeah, okay.

2833
02:32:35,510 --> 02:32:36,069
That sounds like...

2834
02:32:36,069 --> 02:32:37,030
So you don't get embarrassed.

2835
02:32:37,510 --> 02:32:38,069
The nuts went a little...

2836
02:32:38,069 --> 02:32:38,870
I'm just not sure.

2837
02:32:39,510 --> 02:32:40,870
Was it on purpose in that case?

2838
02:32:40,870 --> 02:32:41,829
Did you do it on purpose?

2839
02:32:41,829 --> 02:32:42,629
No, no.

2840
02:32:42,629 --> 02:32:43,190
Okay.

2841
02:32:43,190 --> 02:32:43,510
No.

2842
02:32:43,510 --> 02:32:44,149
What once.

2843
02:32:44,870 --> 02:32:47,110
So you're gonna do a routine with the nunchucks and...

2844
02:32:47,110 --> 02:32:47,430
Okay.

2845
02:32:47,430 --> 02:32:48,229
I'd like to.

2846
02:32:48,229 --> 02:32:49,190
Yeah, for sure.

2847
02:32:49,190 --> 02:32:50,549
Number 13, whenever you're ready, for sure.

2848
02:32:50,549 --> 02:32:51,190
Okay.

2849
02:32:51,190 --> 02:32:51,590
Thank you.

2850
02:32:52,229 --> 02:32:53,110
I do dangerous shit.

2851
02:32:53,110 --> 02:32:54,149
That's pretty cool.

2852
02:32:54,149 --> 02:32:54,790
You do, yeah.

2853
02:32:54,790 --> 02:32:55,829
I jump through a window and...

2854
02:32:55,829 --> 02:32:56,069
Wow.

2855
02:32:56,069 --> 02:32:56,629
That's true, actually.

2856
02:32:56,629 --> 02:32:56,950
That's true.

2857
02:32:57,750 --> 02:32:59,030
You have a history of that.

2858
02:33:00,229 --> 02:33:02,860
All right.

2859
02:33:08,409 --> 02:33:09,370
So close to his face.

2860
02:33:10,250 --> 02:33:10,489
Wow.

2861
02:33:11,530 --> 02:33:12,090
The danger.

2862
02:33:13,129 --> 02:33:14,489
Dr. Schwantz says you can cover.

2863
02:33:16,569 --> 02:33:17,850
Dr. Schwantz is scared.

2864
02:33:20,969 --> 02:33:21,450
Ooh.

2865
02:33:21,450 --> 02:33:21,770
Oh.

2866
02:33:22,489 --> 02:33:23,530
Whoa.

2867
02:33:23,530 --> 02:33:23,850
Wow.

2868
02:33:23,850 --> 02:33:25,209
That's what a flip looks like.

2869
02:33:25,209 --> 02:33:25,930
There's two.

2870
02:33:25,930 --> 02:33:26,649
Give us one more.

2871
02:33:27,290 --> 02:33:27,850
Whoa.

2872
02:33:29,290 --> 02:33:31,049
Oh my goodness gracious.

2873
02:33:31,049 --> 02:33:31,850
Oh, no way.

2874
02:33:31,850 --> 02:33:32,329
Oh, man.

2875
02:33:33,530 --> 02:33:34,010
No way.

2876
02:33:34,010 --> 02:33:35,129
Who wouldn't want to do that?

2877
02:33:35,129 --> 02:33:35,930
Four.

2878
02:33:35,930 --> 02:33:36,170
Okay.

2879
02:33:36,170 --> 02:33:36,729
This is what I wanted to do.

2880
02:33:37,610 --> 02:33:38,969
Oh, number 13.

2881
02:33:38,969 --> 02:33:40,489
That was a tease, but that was good.

2882
02:33:40,489 --> 02:33:41,450
That was very good.

2883
02:33:41,450 --> 02:33:42,329
Wow.

2884
02:33:42,329 --> 02:33:42,969
Very good.

2885
02:33:42,969 --> 02:33:43,850
Number 13.

2886
02:33:44,729 --> 02:33:47,500
Do we have any Xs at all on this table?

2887
02:33:48,059 --> 02:33:49,420
I'm afraid not.

2888
02:33:50,059 --> 02:33:50,620
Number 13.

2889
02:33:50,620 --> 02:33:51,340
That was phenomenal.

2890
02:33:51,340 --> 02:33:52,139
That was unbelievable.

2891
02:33:52,700 --> 02:33:53,819
Somebody would take my place

2892
02:33:54,540 --> 02:33:55,260
doing something.

2893
02:33:55,260 --> 02:33:55,739
I mean, that was...

2894
02:33:57,100 --> 02:33:58,700
If you would hit your nuts once in a while,

2895
02:33:58,700 --> 02:33:59,180
it'd be funny.

2896
02:33:59,899 --> 02:34:00,780
But be careful.

2897
02:34:00,780 --> 02:34:01,500
Oh.

2898
02:34:01,500 --> 02:34:01,899
Oh.

2899
02:34:01,899 --> 02:34:02,620
Oh.

2900
02:34:02,620 --> 02:34:03,340
Of course.

2901
02:34:03,340 --> 02:34:06,139
Oh, he's got jokes.

2902
02:34:07,260 --> 02:34:08,299
Jokes on you.

2903
02:34:08,299 --> 02:34:08,780
I don't have any.

2904
02:34:08,780 --> 02:34:10,940
You got no Xs, number 13.

2905
02:34:10,940 --> 02:34:11,739
That's a plus.

2906
02:34:11,739 --> 02:34:12,139
That's a plus.

2907
02:34:12,139 --> 02:34:12,459
That is.

2908
02:34:12,459 --> 02:34:14,299
Welcome to the next round, number 13.

2909
02:34:14,299 --> 02:34:15,020
Thank you so much.

2910
02:34:15,020 --> 02:34:15,739
All right, sir.

2911
02:34:15,739 --> 02:34:17,180
Excellent luck, 13.

2912
02:34:17,180 --> 02:34:17,739
Thank you.

2913
02:34:17,739 --> 02:34:18,700
It's an obvious choice.

2914
02:34:18,700 --> 02:34:21,100
All about the next procedure operation.

2915
02:34:21,100 --> 02:34:22,219
How many have you passed through?

2916
02:34:22,940 --> 02:34:23,899
Four or five?

2917
02:34:23,899 --> 02:34:25,159
I think like two now.

2918
02:34:25,879 --> 02:34:26,920
It's like six.

2919
02:34:26,920 --> 02:34:27,559
Okay.

2920
02:34:27,559 --> 02:34:30,739
What do we got coming up next?

2921
02:34:31,639 --> 02:34:34,360
Oh, another chair sitter.

2922
02:34:35,079 --> 02:34:36,360
Don't call them chair sitters.

2923
02:34:36,360 --> 02:34:37,079
That's bullshit.

2924
02:34:37,639 --> 02:34:38,920
They're a musician.

2925
02:34:38,920 --> 02:34:40,360
I'm just going to sit on my chair.

2926
02:34:40,360 --> 02:34:40,840
Doesn't...

2927
02:34:40,840 --> 02:34:41,559
Don't streamers...

2928
02:34:42,280 --> 02:34:42,680
That's his...

2929
02:34:43,399 --> 02:34:45,319
I sit in a chair and I play like...

2930
02:34:45,319 --> 02:34:46,280
I was going to say Among Us,

2931
02:34:46,280 --> 02:34:47,319
but I didn't play that game.

2932
02:34:47,319 --> 02:34:49,479
I see you walking around on VR.

2933
02:34:50,200 --> 02:34:51,399
I saw you walking earlier.

2934
02:34:52,860 --> 02:34:54,059
I know that you can do more.

2935
02:34:54,059 --> 02:34:54,940
I don't know that they can.

2936
02:34:56,139 --> 02:34:57,819
They obviously can because they're dancing

2937
02:34:57,819 --> 02:34:58,700
and moving around playing.

2938
02:34:59,979 --> 02:35:01,100
Are you implying that you don't know

2939
02:35:01,100 --> 02:35:02,620
if they could walk around?

2940
02:35:02,620 --> 02:35:05,340
I feel like when you see them come on the stage,

2941
02:35:05,340 --> 02:35:07,020
that's the only time they do it.

2942
02:35:07,020 --> 02:35:08,299
Everywhere else, someone's carrying them.

2943
02:35:08,299 --> 02:35:09,260
You don't know if they're standing

2944
02:35:09,260 --> 02:35:10,620
when they're outside the camera.

2945
02:35:10,620 --> 02:35:12,459
That's completely inaccurate.

2946
02:35:12,459 --> 02:35:13,819
This is a talent that they are showing us.

2947
02:35:13,819 --> 02:35:15,500
It could be like an FDR.

2948
02:35:15,500 --> 02:35:16,139
You never know.

2949
02:35:18,020 --> 02:35:18,899
It could be.

2950
02:35:18,899 --> 02:35:19,459
It's a talent.

2951
02:35:21,579 --> 02:35:23,579
So there's a streaming world

2952
02:35:23,579 --> 02:35:25,319
and the other world.

2953
02:35:25,319 --> 02:35:26,520
There's a streaming world, yeah.

2954
02:35:27,719 --> 02:35:30,420
Doctor, you know very well.

2955
02:35:30,420 --> 02:35:33,299
Well, maybe this is the only world.

2956
02:35:33,299 --> 02:35:34,979
Well, according to the metaverse,

2957
02:35:34,979 --> 02:35:36,500
we'll be all on the same world soon.

2958
02:35:37,459 --> 02:35:38,180
Some of us.

2959
02:35:38,180 --> 02:35:42,180
If you get the Sims 2 level of graphics

2960
02:35:42,180 --> 02:35:44,579
and interaction with the goggles

2961
02:35:44,579 --> 02:35:47,860
that are out here, maybe Sims 1

2962
02:35:47,860 --> 02:35:49,139
level of graphical integrity.

2963
02:35:50,340 --> 02:35:51,379
You're hung up on the graphics,

2964
02:35:51,379 --> 02:35:53,059
but not the connectivity of all mankind.

2965
02:35:53,059 --> 02:35:54,420
And everybody has no legs.

2966
02:35:54,420 --> 02:35:55,139
It's very odd.

2967
02:35:55,139 --> 02:35:55,700
It's very odd.

2968
02:35:55,700 --> 02:35:56,579
It's going to take off though.

2969
02:35:57,139 --> 02:35:57,620
I think so.

2970
02:35:58,420 --> 02:36:01,219
So in what year are we all floating heads?

2971
02:36:01,219 --> 02:36:01,940
2080.

2972
02:36:01,940 --> 02:36:03,299
We're like 50 years too early.

2973
02:36:06,360 --> 02:36:08,120
We're about 50 years too early, I would say.

2974
02:36:09,850 --> 02:36:10,409
So what do we got?

2975
02:36:10,409 --> 02:36:11,049
We got number...

2976
02:36:12,329 --> 02:36:14,969
Don't buzz unless somebody is actually here.

2977
02:36:14,969 --> 02:36:16,409
I fucking told you.

2978
02:36:17,719 --> 02:36:19,000
14, how are you?

2979
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:19,799
Welcome to the show.

2980
02:36:20,760 --> 02:36:21,239
How are you?

2981
02:36:21,239 --> 02:36:22,200
Stop pressing buttons.

2982
02:36:22,200 --> 02:36:23,239
He's showing me what not to do.

2983
02:36:23,239 --> 02:36:23,959
Stop.

2984
02:36:23,959 --> 02:36:24,520
Clear them all.

2985
02:36:25,399 --> 02:36:27,129
14, how are you?

2986
02:36:27,129 --> 02:36:27,450
Welcome.

2987
02:36:28,809 --> 02:36:30,250
I'm going to punch you in the face as hard as I can.

2988
02:36:31,770 --> 02:36:32,170
Let's go.

2989
02:36:32,170 --> 02:36:32,809
You want to go?

2990
02:36:32,809 --> 02:36:33,450
Hi, 14.

2991
02:36:33,450 --> 02:36:34,409
How are you doing today?

2992
02:36:34,409 --> 02:36:35,129
Hi, 14.

2993
02:36:35,129 --> 02:36:36,889
What are you doing for us?

2994
02:36:36,889 --> 02:36:38,329
I'm going to play the piano.

2995
02:36:38,329 --> 02:36:39,049
Wow, piano.

2996
02:36:39,049 --> 02:36:40,010
Where did you learn that?

2997
02:36:40,010 --> 02:36:41,049
Don't say, wow, piano.

2998
02:36:41,049 --> 02:36:41,930
That's me.

2999
02:36:41,930 --> 02:36:43,049
It was genuine.

3000
02:36:43,049 --> 02:36:44,170
That was not genuine.

3001
02:36:44,170 --> 02:36:45,370
That was not genuine.

3002
02:36:45,370 --> 02:36:46,090
Can I redo it?

3003
02:36:46,090 --> 02:36:47,930
Can I take it again?

3004
02:36:48,809 --> 02:36:49,930
Cut this part.

3005
02:36:49,930 --> 02:36:50,569
Start.

3006
02:36:50,569 --> 02:36:51,610
Hmm, piano.

3007
02:36:52,409 --> 02:36:52,969
Wow.

3008
02:36:52,969 --> 02:36:54,729
I'm so sad that he didn't get through.

3009
02:36:54,729 --> 02:36:55,450
Wow, piano.

3010
02:36:59,079 --> 02:36:59,719
Everybody quiet.

3011
02:37:00,680 --> 02:37:01,479
Number 14, hi.

3012
02:37:02,520 --> 02:37:04,280
What are you going to do for us today?

3013
02:37:04,280 --> 02:37:05,479
I'm going to play the piano.

3014
02:37:05,479 --> 02:37:06,520
Wow.

3015
02:37:06,520 --> 02:37:08,440
Okay, let's see that one coming.

3016
02:37:08,440 --> 02:37:09,159
Don't listen to that.

3017
02:37:09,159 --> 02:37:11,719
You know, I'm actually named after a pianist myself.

3018
02:37:11,719 --> 02:37:12,440
What are you playing?

3019
02:37:13,079 --> 02:37:13,719
Oh, I get it.

3020
02:37:13,719 --> 02:37:14,040
Lude.

3021
02:37:14,760 --> 02:37:17,879
Number 14, the only person that matters on this stage is me.

3022
02:37:17,879 --> 02:37:18,520
Okay?

3023
02:37:18,520 --> 02:37:22,440
If I like what you're doing, I'm worth like a hundred votes.

3024
02:37:22,440 --> 02:37:24,280
These guys are just here for fucking fluff.

3025
02:37:24,280 --> 02:37:25,399
Don't listen to this bullshit.

3026
02:37:26,360 --> 02:37:27,639
You have a little bit of a thing that you,

3027
02:37:28,200 --> 02:37:30,200
a package presented to us, right?

3028
02:37:30,200 --> 02:37:31,319
He couldn't trust his own mind.

3029
02:37:31,319 --> 02:37:33,239
That's why we're here, to be clear.

3030
02:37:33,239 --> 02:37:34,360
We want to see the video first.

3031
02:37:34,920 --> 02:37:35,959
We'll watch the video first.

3032
02:37:36,520 --> 02:37:38,120
My name is Joseph Kostetsky.

3033
02:37:38,120 --> 02:37:43,239
I'm 29 and I've been running an arcade named Joseph's Palace for the past few years.

3034
02:37:43,879 --> 02:37:47,079
Ever since I was a young boy, I loved playing video games.

3035
02:37:47,719 --> 02:37:54,280
I remember I would play Marvel versus Capcom 2 with all my friends at my house

3036
02:37:54,280 --> 02:37:56,920
and we'd host tournaments.

3037
02:37:56,920 --> 02:38:01,159
I love doing this so much that I wanted to open my own arcade

3038
02:38:01,159 --> 02:38:03,879
and share my love of video games with the community.

3039
02:38:04,520 --> 02:38:08,040
However, with arcades becoming more and more obsolete,

3040
02:38:08,040 --> 02:38:10,520
I need a better way to promote my business.

3041
02:38:10,520 --> 02:38:13,799
And because Jerma's fan base is so large,

3042
02:38:13,799 --> 02:38:16,680
I think I can use this channel to really promote my arcade.

3043
02:38:17,399 --> 02:38:20,680
I found Jerma's just another guy who likes video games,

3044
02:38:20,680 --> 02:38:21,959
especially the older ones.

3045
02:38:22,520 --> 02:38:26,840
And I feel like that makes me a good candidate for this job.

3046
02:38:29,850 --> 02:38:30,649
Don't clap.

3047
02:38:30,649 --> 02:38:31,209
Don't clap.

3048
02:38:31,209 --> 02:38:31,930
That was beautiful.

3049
02:38:33,370 --> 02:38:34,809
So you own an arcade?

3050
02:38:34,809 --> 02:38:36,010
Yes, I own an arcade.

3051
02:38:36,010 --> 02:38:37,450
And how's that going for you so far?

3052
02:38:38,170 --> 02:38:38,809
Not so good.

3053
02:38:38,809 --> 02:38:39,530
That's why I'm here.

3054
02:38:40,250 --> 02:38:41,209
So what do you think?

3055
02:38:41,209 --> 02:38:44,250
We think that you come onto the show and get the channel and then...

3056
02:38:44,969 --> 02:38:48,010
Yes, convert it to some arcade players, right?

3057
02:38:48,010 --> 02:38:49,850
Would you stream arcade gameplay?

3058
02:38:49,850 --> 02:38:52,170
Well, I view it one in the same.

3059
02:38:52,170 --> 02:38:56,329
I feel like this channel can really be a sponsor for my arcade.

3060
02:38:56,329 --> 02:38:56,969
Okay.

3061
02:38:56,969 --> 02:38:58,729
You said Marvel vs. Capcom.

3062
02:38:59,370 --> 02:39:00,090
Any other games?

3063
02:39:00,090 --> 02:39:01,930
You ever play any Super Smash Brothers?

3064
02:39:01,930 --> 02:39:05,049
Super Smash Brothers is my absolute favorite game.

3065
02:39:05,049 --> 02:39:07,129
Would you play Destiny 2 PVP?

3066
02:39:07,129 --> 02:39:11,690
Stop saying that because people will use it and start writing it in chat all the time.

3067
02:39:11,690 --> 02:39:12,190
Okay.

3068
02:39:12,889 --> 02:39:13,770
What are you going to play for us?

3069
02:39:14,969 --> 02:39:16,409
I'm going to play the piano.

3070
02:39:16,409 --> 02:39:16,909
Okay.

3071
02:39:17,629 --> 02:39:19,069
Let's go ahead and let you do it.

3072
02:39:22,510 --> 02:39:24,030
This is the least interesting part of you.

3073
02:39:31,309 --> 02:39:32,989
Let's get back, because look at how good that...

3074
02:39:35,549 --> 02:39:36,430
So I can do it again.

3075
02:39:57,690 --> 02:40:24,829
Number 14, thank you so much.

3076
02:40:24,829 --> 02:40:25,549
That was phenomenal.

3077
02:40:27,200 --> 02:40:28,079
We're at an impasse.

3078
02:40:29,290 --> 02:40:31,370
We have two nos and two yeses.

3079
02:40:32,090 --> 02:40:35,930
I mean, you are the third piano guy.

3080
02:40:35,930 --> 02:40:36,329
Yes.

3081
02:40:36,329 --> 02:40:40,170
I could be convinced with an overhand Amadeus.

3082
02:40:42,139 --> 02:40:42,780
Over the top.

3083
02:40:43,579 --> 02:40:44,700
Amadeus, like the song?

3084
02:40:44,700 --> 02:40:45,899
No, like the movie.

3085
02:40:45,899 --> 02:40:49,100
In the movie Amadeus, he plays like this.

3086
02:40:49,100 --> 02:40:50,219
While he's drunk.

3087
02:40:50,219 --> 02:40:50,780
Oh, okay.

3088
02:40:50,780 --> 02:40:53,260
To show his skills as a virtuoso.

3089
02:40:53,260 --> 02:40:53,760
Yes.

3090
02:40:56,299 --> 02:40:57,899
To convince these two idiots,

3091
02:40:58,700 --> 02:41:00,059
could you do something else?

3092
02:41:00,059 --> 02:41:01,979
Something a little bit more of a fast pace, too?

3093
02:41:01,979 --> 02:41:06,459
Well, actually, my problem was it was a bit too fast.

3094
02:41:06,940 --> 02:41:08,700
Fur Elise was written for Elise,

3095
02:41:09,420 --> 02:41:12,299
and it was actually really supposed to be a tender loving song

3096
02:41:12,299 --> 02:41:15,180
that picked up at times like the heights of relationships,

3097
02:41:15,180 --> 02:41:17,260
but also slowed down like the lows.

3098
02:41:17,260 --> 02:41:17,579
Right.

3099
02:41:17,579 --> 02:41:20,809
And I didn't feel the passion come through, although the notes did.

3100
02:41:20,809 --> 02:41:21,450
Right.

3101
02:41:21,450 --> 02:41:23,049
What a beautiful story.

3102
02:41:23,049 --> 02:41:24,090
Oh, okay.

3103
02:41:24,090 --> 02:41:25,950
He's got a point.

3104
02:41:25,950 --> 02:41:26,670
Number 14.

3105
02:41:28,079 --> 02:41:30,319
That was a phenomenal, phenomenal time on the piano.

3106
02:41:30,879 --> 02:41:32,879
But after hearing from some of the judges...

3107
02:41:32,879 --> 02:41:34,719
I only know what video game music is.

3108
02:41:34,719 --> 02:41:35,280
What do you got?

3109
02:41:36,239 --> 02:41:38,479
He's played like 6,000 hours of Path of a Devil.

3110
02:41:38,479 --> 02:41:40,719
My favorite genre is video game music.

3111
02:41:41,520 --> 02:41:43,360
I don't understand what you're doing up there.

3112
02:41:43,360 --> 02:41:45,420
I'm just trying my best.

3113
02:41:45,420 --> 02:41:47,979
I think you got a great future ahead of you.

3114
02:41:48,540 --> 02:41:49,100
I just got...

3115
02:41:49,100 --> 02:41:52,219
I just don't really listen to it.

3116
02:41:52,219 --> 02:41:55,020
I thought that was quite lovely.

3117
02:41:55,020 --> 02:41:55,659
Quite lovely.

3118
02:41:55,659 --> 02:42:00,159
But I have a question for you that might make my decision.

3119
02:42:01,530 --> 02:42:06,090
Do you have a bone spur on the left interior of your right mandible?

3120
02:42:07,530 --> 02:42:12,280
I don't even know.

3121
02:42:12,280 --> 02:42:12,920
He's a liar.

3122
02:42:17,739 --> 02:42:18,620
Number 14.

3123
02:42:18,620 --> 02:42:19,420
I'm so sorry.

3124
02:42:20,569 --> 02:42:21,690
You got a great look.

3125
02:42:21,690 --> 02:42:23,049
I think you got the great look.

3126
02:42:23,049 --> 02:42:24,010
You got the look of the part.

3127
02:42:24,010 --> 02:42:28,329
But apparently having a piano is an automatic no from like two people.

3128
02:42:28,329 --> 02:42:29,610
But I don't want you to quit.

3129
02:42:29,610 --> 02:42:30,090
Okay?

3130
02:42:30,090 --> 02:42:30,489
What is it?

3131
02:42:30,489 --> 02:42:30,729
Who is it?

3132
02:42:30,729 --> 02:42:31,930
Joseph's Arcade.

3133
02:42:31,930 --> 02:42:33,850
Joseph's Arcade can be a big thing one day.

3134
02:42:34,489 --> 02:42:35,690
It can be a big thing one day.

3135
02:42:35,690 --> 02:42:36,489
I want you to know that.

3136
02:42:36,489 --> 02:42:37,129
No, I'm going to say yes.

3137
02:42:37,129 --> 02:42:37,850
Can you hear me?

3138
02:42:37,850 --> 02:42:38,889
Joseph's Arcade one day.

3139
02:42:38,889 --> 02:42:39,850
It's going to be huge.

3140
02:42:39,850 --> 02:42:43,049
Thank you just for the opportunity to get a chance to get out there.

3141
02:42:43,049 --> 02:42:43,930
Wait, what do we have right now?

3142
02:42:43,930 --> 02:42:45,930
Joseph's Arcade and piano lines.

3143
02:42:45,930 --> 02:42:48,489
They're going to be talking about your arcade in the big times.

3144
02:42:48,489 --> 02:42:49,450
We lost our monitor.

3145
02:42:49,450 --> 02:42:50,809
It's in the big leagues.

3146
02:42:50,809 --> 02:42:51,610
Okay, listen.

3147
02:42:52,170 --> 02:42:52,809
What do we have?

3148
02:42:55,440 --> 02:42:56,239
Thank you.

3149
02:42:56,239 --> 02:42:56,719
Thank you.

3150
02:42:56,719 --> 02:42:57,600
That was very, very nice.

3151
02:42:57,600 --> 02:42:58,399
Thank you very much.

3152
02:42:58,399 --> 02:42:58,959
Thank you.

3153
02:42:58,959 --> 02:43:00,399
All right, just stop fucking around.

3154
02:43:01,120 --> 02:43:01,680
Thank you.

3155
02:43:01,680 --> 02:43:03,840
Again, you were seriously such a great job.

3156
02:43:03,840 --> 02:43:05,440
You should have been the first player.

3157
02:43:05,440 --> 02:43:06,639
You just honestly.

3158
02:43:06,639 --> 02:43:07,200
Sorry.

3159
02:43:07,200 --> 02:43:08,399
It was the order.

3160
02:43:08,399 --> 02:43:08,879
Yeah.

3161
02:43:08,879 --> 02:43:09,760
It was a great job.

3162
02:43:09,760 --> 02:43:10,479
It really was.

3163
02:43:10,479 --> 02:43:12,079
It happened like that in Squid Game too.

3164
02:43:12,079 --> 02:43:13,680
But that was such a phenomenal piano player.

3165
02:43:13,680 --> 02:43:14,639
The order matters.

3166
02:43:14,639 --> 02:43:15,920
The order does matter, Jerma.

3167
02:43:17,360 --> 02:43:18,559
A good Jerma is lucky.

3168
02:43:19,200 --> 02:43:20,159
That's true.

3169
02:43:20,159 --> 02:43:20,639
What did you say?

3170
02:43:20,639 --> 02:43:21,600
What was my character?

3171
02:43:21,600 --> 02:43:24,479
You said I was like 10 luck and like five charisma.

3172
02:43:24,479 --> 02:43:24,879
Yeah.

3173
02:43:24,879 --> 02:43:27,200
15% power, 10% skill.

3174
02:43:27,920 --> 02:43:30,399
Okay, my D&D character was what?

3175
02:43:30,399 --> 02:43:31,440
Like if I were to make one.

3176
02:43:31,440 --> 02:43:36,399
I said you would put everything in charisma and everything else is a dump step.

3177
02:43:36,399 --> 02:43:36,899
Okay.

3178
02:43:37,360 --> 02:43:40,319
By the way, the Myriad is a great show going on.

3179
02:43:40,319 --> 02:43:41,120
It's Myriad.

3180
02:43:41,760 --> 02:43:42,399
Oh, fuck off.

3181
02:43:42,399 --> 02:43:43,120
You're not getting a plug.

3182
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:45,040
Who's coming up next?

3183
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:48,639
We got number 15, I think, coming up here.

3184
02:43:48,639 --> 02:43:49,139
Yeah.

3185
02:43:49,920 --> 02:43:51,120
15 should be running.

3186
02:43:51,120 --> 02:43:51,920
Getting down to it.

3187
02:43:51,920 --> 02:43:52,559
Getting down to it.

3188
02:43:52,559 --> 02:43:53,040
Getting down to it.

3189
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:55,360
Number 15, go ahead and come on out.

3190
02:43:55,360 --> 02:43:56,639
We'll see what you got here.

3191
02:43:58,799 --> 02:43:59,520
You do hunch.

3192
02:44:00,239 --> 02:44:01,129
A little bit, yeah.

3193
02:44:02,620 --> 02:44:03,420
Hello, 15.

3194
02:44:04,059 --> 02:44:04,860
Hello.

3195
02:44:04,860 --> 02:44:05,659
I'll be clear.

3196
02:44:05,659 --> 02:44:06,700
Clear your exes, by the way.

3197
02:44:06,700 --> 02:44:07,579
How are you?

3198
02:44:09,180 --> 02:44:09,979
We're doing great.

3199
02:44:09,979 --> 02:44:10,700
How are you, 15?

3200
02:44:11,260 --> 02:44:18,760
15, what are you going to do for us today?

3201
02:44:18,760 --> 02:44:19,959
You got something?

3202
02:44:19,959 --> 02:44:22,360
No piano, by the way, so surfers can be happy.

3203
02:44:22,360 --> 02:44:26,360
It's difficult.

3204
02:44:26,360 --> 02:44:27,159
I like the fumbling.

3205
02:44:27,159 --> 02:44:29,079
The fumbling is like exactly what I was going to do.

3206
02:44:29,079 --> 02:44:30,920
I think it's just an introduction.

3207
02:44:30,920 --> 02:44:31,479
Can you hear me?

3208
02:44:32,120 --> 02:44:32,920
We can hear you, yeah.

3209
02:44:32,920 --> 02:44:33,420
Okay.

3210
02:44:34,120 --> 02:44:34,620
Hello.

3211
02:44:35,079 --> 02:44:36,120
Hey, 15, how are you?

3212
02:44:36,120 --> 02:44:37,159
Good afternoon.

3213
02:44:38,520 --> 02:44:47,319
My ability is doing slightly obscure impressions of people saying very specific things.

3214
02:44:47,799 --> 02:44:48,600
Okay.

3215
02:44:48,600 --> 02:44:50,520
Can you do any serial characters?

3216
02:44:50,520 --> 02:44:51,799
Serial characters?

3217
02:44:51,799 --> 02:44:53,319
Any serial mascots like...

3218
02:44:54,360 --> 02:44:55,159
Great!

3219
02:44:56,280 --> 02:44:57,079
That's a yes from me.

3220
02:44:57,639 --> 02:44:58,920
You don't need to impress me anymore.

3221
02:44:58,920 --> 02:45:00,840
That is Antonio the Tiger.

3222
02:45:00,840 --> 02:45:01,879
Yeah, that's very good.

3223
02:45:03,799 --> 02:45:04,840
Why do you have an accent now?

3224
02:45:06,360 --> 02:45:11,399
Before I was doing you, I've learned your voice, but I'm new here, so this is...

3225
02:45:11,399 --> 02:45:12,440
Oh, okay, so you have an accent.

3226
02:45:12,440 --> 02:45:13,719
It's more comfortable to speak.

3227
02:45:13,719 --> 02:45:14,440
Where are you from?

3228
02:45:14,920 --> 02:45:18,379
Um, from Stockton.

3229
02:45:18,379 --> 02:45:19,020
Stock...

3230
02:45:19,020 --> 02:45:19,659
Oh, Stockton.

3231
02:45:19,659 --> 02:45:20,159
Sweden.

3232
02:45:20,940 --> 02:45:21,659
California.

3233
02:45:21,659 --> 02:45:23,659
Oh, never mind.

3234
02:45:23,659 --> 02:45:24,159
Great.

3235
02:45:24,700 --> 02:45:25,739
You're from California, okay.

3236
02:45:25,739 --> 02:45:26,700
Stockton, California.

3237
02:45:26,700 --> 02:45:28,860
So what are you going to do exactly for us today?

3238
02:45:29,500 --> 02:45:34,620
The first one is a great Shakespearean actor, Peter O'Toole, doing...

3239
02:45:36,079 --> 02:45:36,579
Okay.

3240
02:45:50,059 --> 02:45:53,209
Nothing, darling, helps in my ride.

3241
02:45:54,409 --> 02:45:58,590
I used to know a bitch named Eric Wright.

3242
02:45:58,590 --> 02:46:02,270
We used to go around and fuck the hoes at night.

3243
02:46:02,270 --> 02:46:04,350
Take that, you motherfucking gangster bitch!

3244
02:46:07,739 --> 02:46:09,020
Why are there no other accents?

3245
02:46:09,020 --> 02:46:09,659
That is the...

3246
02:46:10,299 --> 02:46:11,659
Because it is his voice.

3247
02:46:11,659 --> 02:46:13,500
His voice, he doesn't speak with you.

3248
02:46:13,500 --> 02:46:14,139
Yeah, that's great.

3249
02:46:15,020 --> 02:46:15,579
That's great.

3250
02:46:16,459 --> 02:46:17,180
What else do you have?

3251
02:46:18,139 --> 02:46:24,940
Um, this is Harrison Ford going into store for Halloween candy.

3252
02:46:24,940 --> 02:46:25,440
Okay.

3253
02:46:30,479 --> 02:46:31,280
Bitter honey.

3254
02:46:34,479 --> 02:46:35,280
Blow pop!

3255
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:40,600
Charleston shoe.

3256
02:46:41,399 --> 02:46:43,370
Just that one.

3257
02:46:43,370 --> 02:46:44,889
That was good, that was good, yeah.

3258
02:46:44,889 --> 02:46:45,610
Excellent.

3259
02:46:45,610 --> 02:46:46,110
Excellent.

3260
02:46:47,850 --> 02:46:49,530
Dateline Keith Morrison.

3261
02:46:49,530 --> 02:46:50,649
You watch Dateline?

3262
02:46:52,010 --> 02:46:52,809
Seldomly, yeah.

3263
02:46:52,809 --> 02:46:53,610
Seldom.

3264
02:46:53,610 --> 02:46:54,250
Oh, you are old.

3265
02:46:54,250 --> 02:46:55,049
This is Dateline.

3266
02:46:55,049 --> 02:46:56,010
He's 37 in this room.

3267
02:46:56,010 --> 02:47:00,889
Dateline host Keith Morrison describing genital warts syndrome.

3268
02:47:00,889 --> 02:47:01,610
Oh, god.

3269
02:47:02,809 --> 02:47:03,610
Somebody please spread that.

3270
02:47:03,610 --> 02:47:04,329
Genital warts.

3271
02:47:06,329 --> 02:47:08,250
Colored or whitish balls.

3272
02:47:08,250 --> 02:47:09,770
Show up on your vulva.

3273
02:47:10,409 --> 02:47:11,530
Vagina.

3274
02:47:11,530 --> 02:47:12,090
Servings.

3275
02:47:12,090 --> 02:47:13,850
Dr. Sports and Stiller, yes.

3276
02:47:13,850 --> 02:47:15,450
Scrooge or anus.

3277
02:47:15,450 --> 02:47:16,329
These are medical terms.

3278
02:47:16,329 --> 02:47:17,610
Sounds like Cave Johnson.

3279
02:47:17,610 --> 02:47:20,889
They kind of look a little like cauliflower.

3280
02:47:20,889 --> 02:47:23,930
That is from the actual website.

3281
02:47:23,930 --> 02:47:24,430
Okay.

3282
02:47:29,840 --> 02:47:30,479
Gary Busey.

3283
02:47:30,479 --> 02:47:32,319
You sort of look like the Gary Busey.

3284
02:47:32,319 --> 02:47:33,520
I've heard the Gary Busey.

3285
02:47:33,520 --> 02:47:34,559
Willem Dafoe, you know.

3286
02:47:36,559 --> 02:47:37,059
Oh, god.

3287
02:47:39,559 --> 02:47:40,440
I mean, my teeth.

3288
02:47:40,440 --> 02:47:41,159
I got big teeth.

3289
02:47:41,159 --> 02:47:41,659
Let's see.

3290
02:47:42,760 --> 02:47:44,120
I made that myself.

3291
02:47:44,120 --> 02:47:45,719
Wait, what is that?

3292
02:47:45,719 --> 02:47:46,219
Paper.

3293
02:47:46,219 --> 02:47:47,799
A piece of paper with Sharpie.

3294
02:47:47,799 --> 02:47:48,760
Oh, it's paper.

3295
02:47:48,760 --> 02:47:50,040
I thought it was actually fake teeth.

3296
02:47:50,040 --> 02:47:53,079
He looks like Jim Carrey from Donald Trump.

3297
02:47:53,079 --> 02:47:53,799
All right, all right.

3298
02:47:53,799 --> 02:47:55,000
The imposter is...

3299
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:55,500
Shush!

3300
02:47:56,520 --> 02:47:57,159
I took it back.

3301
02:47:57,159 --> 02:47:57,719
I'm sorry.

3302
02:47:57,719 --> 02:47:58,600
You have to say no.

3303
02:47:58,600 --> 02:47:59,239
That was great.

3304
02:47:59,959 --> 02:48:01,799
Okay, this is a...

3305
02:48:01,799 --> 02:48:02,680
I'm close to a no.

3306
02:48:02,680 --> 02:48:05,399
Gary Busey is a Spanish instructor.

3307
02:48:05,399 --> 02:48:05,899
Okay.

3308
02:48:18,270 --> 02:48:19,309
I've been no for the whole time.

3309
02:48:19,309 --> 02:48:20,190
That was the bingo song.

3310
02:48:20,190 --> 02:48:21,149
I've been no the whole time.

3311
02:48:21,149 --> 02:48:21,790
I can't...

3312
02:48:21,790 --> 02:48:22,750
You know what?

3313
02:48:22,750 --> 02:48:23,790
Could I make a request?

3314
02:48:24,430 --> 02:48:26,110
Because, you know, at the end of the day,

3315
02:48:26,110 --> 02:48:26,909
impressions are great,

3316
02:48:26,909 --> 02:48:29,389
but Jerma really defaults to one always.

3317
02:48:29,389 --> 02:48:29,950
Yeah.

3318
02:48:29,950 --> 02:48:31,309
And it says Donald Trump.

3319
02:48:32,680 --> 02:48:33,559
Can you do a Donald?

3320
02:48:33,559 --> 02:48:34,840
Can you do a Donald Trump?

3321
02:48:34,840 --> 02:48:37,159
Could you do Donald Trump saying that

3322
02:48:37,159 --> 02:48:38,760
you're a better streamer than Jerma is?

3323
02:48:39,719 --> 02:48:40,200
What do we got?

3324
02:48:40,200 --> 02:48:40,700
One X?

3325
02:48:40,700 --> 02:48:42,600
You are, you are, or...

3326
02:48:42,600 --> 02:48:43,100
You...

3327
02:48:43,100 --> 02:48:43,559
Yeah, I'm a better...

3328
02:48:43,559 --> 02:48:44,200
Right, who are you?

3329
02:48:44,200 --> 02:48:45,239
You'd be Donald Trump.

3330
02:48:45,239 --> 02:48:47,399
You're a better streamer, better, better.

3331
02:48:47,399 --> 02:48:48,280
Okay, look it up.

3332
02:48:48,280 --> 02:48:48,840
It's true.

3333
02:48:48,840 --> 02:48:50,200
You're a better, better streamer.

3334
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:51,500
It was on the...

3335
02:48:53,799 --> 02:48:54,360
Okay, okay.

3336
02:48:54,360 --> 02:48:55,079
It was on the spot.

3337
02:48:55,959 --> 02:48:57,799
Let me try and bring it to my side.

3338
02:48:57,799 --> 02:48:58,760
I'm a hundred percent yes.

3339
02:48:58,760 --> 02:49:01,319
Number one, a hundred percent yes.

3340
02:49:01,319 --> 02:49:03,079
To me, you're the next Jerma.

3341
02:49:03,079 --> 02:49:05,799
You had a serial mascot character.

3342
02:49:06,360 --> 02:49:07,159
That's a huge point.

3343
02:49:07,159 --> 02:49:08,120
That's like nine out of ten.

3344
02:49:08,120 --> 02:49:09,610
We're almost there.

3345
02:49:09,610 --> 02:49:11,530
All of your references are dated.

3346
02:49:11,530 --> 02:49:13,129
I don't know what you're talking about.

3347
02:49:13,129 --> 02:49:14,809
I have not a single clue,

3348
02:49:14,809 --> 02:49:16,809
and that's the extra point to get to ten.

3349
02:49:16,809 --> 02:49:17,690
Oh, that's good.

3350
02:49:17,690 --> 02:49:18,090
You don't...

3351
02:49:18,090 --> 02:49:19,450
How do you not know Harrison Ford?

3352
02:49:19,450 --> 02:49:20,010
He's like still...

3353
02:49:20,010 --> 02:49:20,809
He was in the last season.

3354
02:49:20,809 --> 02:49:23,129
How do you not know Harrison Ford?

3355
02:49:23,129 --> 02:49:24,569
Harrison Ford's still making movies.

3356
02:49:24,569 --> 02:49:25,370
Oh, sure.

3357
02:49:25,370 --> 02:49:25,850
Yeah.

3358
02:49:25,850 --> 02:49:27,129
For like old women.

3359
02:49:27,129 --> 02:49:28,729
Okay, so what...

3360
02:49:28,729 --> 02:49:29,610
You're a yes.

3361
02:49:30,329 --> 02:49:31,049
Yes, completely.

3362
02:49:31,049 --> 02:49:33,579
I have something else you were going to say.

3363
02:49:33,579 --> 02:49:33,979
Can you do...

3364
02:49:33,979 --> 02:49:34,620
You're fantastic.

3365
02:49:34,620 --> 02:49:35,100
That's okay.

3366
02:49:35,100 --> 02:49:35,659
Can you do...

3367
02:49:36,459 --> 02:49:37,260
Can you do Yoda?

3368
02:49:39,549 --> 02:49:40,590
Yoda, I can do.

3369
02:49:42,030 --> 02:49:42,670
Shit, he can do...

3370
02:49:42,670 --> 02:49:46,270
I will take all of your exes back.

3371
02:49:46,270 --> 02:49:47,469
Yes, yes.

3372
02:49:47,469 --> 02:49:47,969
No.

3373
02:49:49,950 --> 02:49:51,629
Doctor, doctor, what do you think about this?

3374
02:49:51,629 --> 02:49:52,129
Well...

3375
02:49:52,750 --> 02:49:54,670
Smelling his fingers, he is.

3376
02:49:54,670 --> 02:49:55,229
I'm not...

3377
02:49:55,229 --> 02:49:56,829
My fingers are like out.

3378
02:49:56,829 --> 02:49:57,870
I'm gonna keep them here.

3379
02:49:57,870 --> 02:49:59,870
I'm not smelling my fingers.

3380
02:49:59,870 --> 02:50:00,350
They're...

3381
02:50:00,350 --> 02:50:01,709
I'm gonna keep them at the table for now on.

3382
02:50:02,670 --> 02:50:04,030
Doctor, what do you think?

3383
02:50:05,309 --> 02:50:06,350
Number 15.

3384
02:50:08,729 --> 02:50:10,889
I'm afraid it's gonna have to be a no, but

3385
02:50:11,610 --> 02:50:13,370
I thank you for your accuracy.

3386
02:50:14,860 --> 02:50:16,059
Number 15.

3387
02:50:16,059 --> 02:50:19,260
It looks like we've got three nos.

3388
02:50:19,260 --> 02:50:20,780
Please, I'm begging you.

3389
02:50:20,780 --> 02:50:22,540
You're the only one who can turn this.

3390
02:50:22,540 --> 02:50:25,420
Give me a one sentence pitch on why I should switch.

3391
02:50:25,420 --> 02:50:27,180
I think I gave some pretty good reasons.

3392
02:50:28,360 --> 02:50:30,840
I'm defaulting back to serial character.

3393
02:50:30,840 --> 02:50:32,200
All of his references are dated.

3394
02:50:32,200 --> 02:50:32,840
Just because you know what...

3395
02:50:32,840 --> 02:50:36,280
I think Jerm is intimidated by him being good at the stuff he's not good at.

3396
02:50:36,280 --> 02:50:36,760
Hey.

3397
02:50:36,760 --> 02:50:37,479
No, no.

3398
02:50:37,479 --> 02:50:39,639
Just because you know what a serial character is

3399
02:50:39,639 --> 02:50:41,000
does not mean that you should take over my channel.

3400
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:41,500
Start.

3401
02:50:42,379 --> 02:50:43,180
You know what?

3402
02:50:43,180 --> 02:50:45,360
It's Ludwig.

3403
02:50:45,360 --> 02:50:46,459
Oh.

3404
02:50:46,459 --> 02:50:47,100
Sorry.

3405
02:50:47,100 --> 02:50:49,399
I didn't mean to tease you like that.

3406
02:50:49,399 --> 02:50:50,120
Number 15.

3407
02:50:51,479 --> 02:50:52,350
I'm so sorry.

3408
02:50:52,350 --> 02:50:52,850
Thank you.

3409
02:50:55,360 --> 02:50:56,799
I loved Tony the Tiger.

3410
02:51:00,719 --> 02:51:02,319
But just because you know what a serial character...

3411
02:51:02,319 --> 02:51:03,120
That doesn't mean you...

3412
02:51:03,120 --> 02:51:05,040
Oh, you know what Tony the Tiger is?

3413
02:51:05,040 --> 02:51:06,079
I think that was the last one.

3414
02:51:06,079 --> 02:51:07,600
Do what Tony the Tiger right now.

3415
02:51:07,680 --> 02:51:08,159
I can't.

3416
02:51:08,159 --> 02:51:08,799
15 was the last one.

3417
02:51:10,799 --> 02:51:12,000
I can't do it.

3418
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:12,879
It's like Tony Tiger.

3419
02:51:12,879 --> 02:51:13,520
What do you mean?

3420
02:51:13,520 --> 02:51:14,159
That was the last one.

3421
02:51:14,159 --> 02:51:14,719
Are we at the end?

3422
02:51:15,840 --> 02:51:16,319
I'm blocked.

3423
02:51:16,319 --> 02:51:17,840
That was all 16 that...

3424
02:51:19,200 --> 02:51:19,600
What are you...

3425
02:51:19,600 --> 02:51:21,120
Wait, no, no, no, no.

3426
02:51:21,120 --> 02:51:21,920
What are you doing here?

3427
02:51:21,920 --> 02:51:22,559
Connor!

3428
02:51:22,559 --> 02:51:26,239
Hey, I know everybody's had chances when they come back.

3429
02:51:26,239 --> 02:51:26,719
Okay.

3430
02:51:26,719 --> 02:51:27,040
Maybe...

3431
02:51:27,840 --> 02:51:28,959
I don't have talent or anything.

3432
02:51:28,959 --> 02:51:29,360
No, no, no.

3433
02:51:29,360 --> 02:51:30,159
Go, go, go.

3434
02:51:30,159 --> 02:51:30,639
Connor, go.

3435
02:51:30,639 --> 02:51:32,479
Well, I can like...

3436
02:51:32,479 --> 02:51:32,879
I can like...

3437
02:51:32,879 --> 02:51:35,200
You got a chat and I can't read your chat.

3438
02:51:35,200 --> 02:51:35,520
Hit the fucking button.

3439
02:51:35,520 --> 02:51:36,959
You know, I can read your chat, Ludwig.

3440
02:51:37,440 --> 02:51:38,719
No, for sure, man.

3441
02:51:38,719 --> 02:51:39,600
Oh, is it red?

3442
02:51:39,600 --> 02:51:40,159
Oh.

3443
02:51:40,159 --> 02:51:41,280
Connor, you have your own...

3444
02:51:41,280 --> 02:51:41,920
Listen.

3445
02:51:41,920 --> 02:51:43,120
Play the sad music.

3446
02:51:43,120 --> 02:51:44,239
I'm 5'8 with shoes, dog.

3447
02:51:44,239 --> 02:51:44,959
Hey, hey, wait, wait.

3448
02:51:44,959 --> 02:51:45,840
Connor, stay right there.

3449
02:51:45,840 --> 02:51:46,879
Play the sad music, please.

3450
02:51:47,840 --> 02:51:50,329
Connor, you're a young guy

3451
02:51:51,440 --> 02:51:53,360
and you've got, I think, a great future in front of you.

3452
02:51:53,920 --> 02:51:55,120
I'm 37.

3453
02:51:55,120 --> 02:51:56,879
I'm 45 years older than you.

3454
02:51:58,170 --> 02:52:01,049
I think that you have a lot of comedy.

3455
02:52:01,049 --> 02:52:02,569
You have a lot of really good shticks

3456
02:52:03,450 --> 02:52:04,649
and I think you're a really nice guy.

3457
02:52:05,450 --> 02:52:07,610
But you ain't me and you never will be.

3458
02:52:08,649 --> 02:52:11,129
Be you and be the best you that you can be.

3459
02:52:12,409 --> 02:52:14,090
Is that one X or three?

3460
02:52:14,090 --> 02:52:14,489
It's all...

3461
02:52:17,450 --> 02:52:18,729
Connor, if you start crying anymore...

3462
02:52:18,729 --> 02:52:20,409
I don't know where we're going.

3463
02:52:20,409 --> 02:52:21,930
I think you've got a great future.

3464
02:52:21,930 --> 02:52:23,690
You're a really young, smart man

3465
02:52:25,530 --> 02:52:26,569
and like security...

3466
02:52:26,569 --> 02:52:28,010
I mean, I'm pretending to cry right now,

3467
02:52:28,010 --> 02:52:29,930
but like he should never have gotten up here.

3468
02:52:29,930 --> 02:52:31,690
He should have been removed immediately.

3469
02:52:32,489 --> 02:52:34,250
And we all cry on these shows.

3470
02:52:36,569 --> 02:52:38,010
Security should have taken him out immediately.

3471
02:52:38,010 --> 02:52:38,969
Sorry, it's tough.

3472
02:52:39,850 --> 02:52:40,969
Thank you for the opportunity.

3473
02:52:40,969 --> 02:52:42,729
Yeah, there was no opportunity in the first place.

3474
02:52:42,729 --> 02:52:43,770
You have Connor's pants.

3475
02:52:43,770 --> 02:52:44,409
Read the room.

3476
02:52:44,409 --> 02:52:46,969
You're your own channel.

3477
02:52:46,969 --> 02:52:48,489
You don't need another channel.

3478
02:52:48,489 --> 02:52:50,170
Unless you want to try your Yoda.

3479
02:52:50,170 --> 02:52:51,209
Oh, he's got a Yoda.

3480
02:52:54,760 --> 02:52:56,760
All right, we've got some more deliberation to do.

3481
02:52:56,760 --> 02:52:58,200
Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be right back.

3482
02:52:58,200 --> 02:53:01,799
I think I'm looking at the right camera for part three of Who Will...

3483
02:53:02,280 --> 02:53:02,680
I can't...

3484
02:53:02,680 --> 02:53:05,079
Who is gonna be German next?

3485
02:53:05,079 --> 02:53:05,639
Shut up.

3486
02:53:06,360 --> 02:53:08,010
Who will replace me?

3487
02:53:08,010 --> 02:53:09,770
You should call it German 986.

3488
02:53:09,770 --> 02:53:10,489
No.

3489
02:53:10,489 --> 02:53:12,329
Who will replace me?

3490
02:53:12,329 --> 02:53:13,930
Coming back soon in a few minutes.

3491
03:04:50,139 --> 03:08:06,760
Okay.

3492
03:08:06,760 --> 03:08:07,239
All right.

3493
03:08:07,239 --> 03:08:07,879
Okay.

3494
03:08:07,879 --> 03:08:08,379
Okay.

3495
03:08:10,219 --> 03:08:13,340
Seeing a little bit of people talk about number 15.

3496
03:08:13,340 --> 03:08:14,139
Seeing 15.

3497
03:08:14,139 --> 03:08:15,020
Bring 15 back.

3498
03:08:15,020 --> 03:08:15,739
Where's 15?

3499
03:08:16,780 --> 03:08:18,860
We had a deliberation.

3500
03:08:19,579 --> 03:08:20,780
We have four judges.

3501
03:08:21,979 --> 03:08:23,500
15 was eliminated.

3502
03:08:24,379 --> 03:08:26,299
And that's how you have to handle that.

3503
03:08:26,940 --> 03:08:27,500
15.

3504
03:08:28,059 --> 03:08:29,260
Impressions are one thing.

3505
03:08:29,260 --> 03:08:30,620
But demeanor.

3506
03:08:30,620 --> 03:08:31,500
Way that you talk.

3507
03:08:31,500 --> 03:08:32,219
Way that you act.

3508
03:08:32,940 --> 03:08:35,500
You can't just say, oh, 15 should go through.

3509
03:08:35,500 --> 03:08:36,299
He was a great guy.

3510
03:08:36,299 --> 03:08:37,100
He was really funny.

3511
03:08:37,819 --> 03:08:38,780
Oh, you say that now.

3512
03:08:39,659 --> 03:08:40,219
What?

3513
03:08:40,219 --> 03:08:42,379
You voted no, too?

3514
03:08:42,379 --> 03:08:43,579
Well, to tack on.

3515
03:08:43,579 --> 03:08:44,540
Doc Dreamer memory.

3516
03:08:45,100 --> 03:08:48,620
You were talking about how he medically just doesn't even line up.

3517
03:08:48,620 --> 03:08:50,620
Medically, he has bone spurs, I heard.

3518
03:08:53,639 --> 03:08:54,360
Here's the thing.

3519
03:08:55,000 --> 03:09:02,030
Um, in order to play Jeremy, he has to have the physical as well as the-

3520
03:09:02,030 --> 03:09:02,510
Exactly.

3521
03:09:03,549 --> 03:09:05,229
Listen to the doctor, for God's sakes.

3522
03:09:05,229 --> 03:09:06,110
He's a doctor.

3523
03:09:06,110 --> 03:09:06,590
Well-

3524
03:09:06,590 --> 03:09:07,950
Well, they're probably Americans.

3525
03:09:07,950 --> 03:09:08,510
They don't do that.

3526
03:09:10,030 --> 03:09:10,430
Yeah.

3527
03:09:10,430 --> 03:09:18,430
And I mean, obviously, the thing to match Jeremy is just be a total maniac.

3528
03:09:19,709 --> 03:09:22,989
But, you know, on the other side, you have to survive him.

3529
03:09:23,790 --> 03:09:24,430
What do you mean?

3530
03:09:24,430 --> 03:09:26,030
You mean like I'm a funny guy, right?

3531
03:09:26,030 --> 03:09:27,469
Like surviving Jerma?

3532
03:09:28,270 --> 03:09:28,670
Yeah, I know.

3533
03:09:28,670 --> 03:09:29,229
I know that sounds difficult.

3534
03:09:29,229 --> 03:09:30,030
What do you mean maniac?

3535
03:09:30,829 --> 03:09:31,950
A total loony.

3536
03:09:31,950 --> 03:09:32,590
Yeah, total-

3537
03:09:32,590 --> 03:09:34,110
No, you mean like a wacko guy.

3538
03:09:34,110 --> 03:09:34,750
Wacko job.

3539
03:09:35,389 --> 03:09:35,790
Yeah.

3540
03:09:35,790 --> 03:09:36,270
Oh, okay.

3541
03:09:36,270 --> 03:09:36,670
All right.

3542
03:09:36,670 --> 03:09:37,149
Super mean.

3543
03:09:37,149 --> 03:09:38,110
15 is gone.

3544
03:09:38,670 --> 03:09:39,549
He was funny.

3545
03:09:39,549 --> 03:09:44,430
He was nice, but maybe didn't have what it took to be the next Jerboff.

3546
03:09:44,430 --> 03:09:44,989
985.

3547
03:09:45,709 --> 03:09:50,909
So what we're going to do now to narrow it down even more, we have to be certain.

3548
03:09:51,790 --> 03:09:58,190
The final round until you, yes, you, vote for who is the next Jerma 985.

3549
03:09:58,829 --> 03:10:01,149
We're going to bring out the contestants that we passed through,

3550
03:10:01,870 --> 03:10:04,750
and they are going to read a very important passage.

3551
03:10:05,549 --> 03:10:08,190
The JermaCraft copypasta passage.

3552
03:10:09,159 --> 03:10:12,120
However they do it, we are going to vote for it.

3553
03:10:12,120 --> 03:10:16,360
How well they do it, how smartly, how energetically,

3554
03:10:16,920 --> 03:10:18,440
we are going to vote for them as well.

3555
03:10:19,159 --> 03:10:21,479
This is the final round to the final.

3556
03:10:21,479 --> 03:10:23,159
Whoever goes through this round-

3557
03:10:23,159 --> 03:10:24,200
It's not the final round.

3558
03:10:26,040 --> 03:10:28,600
It's the final round for us.

3559
03:10:28,600 --> 03:10:31,000
And then you get to decide who wins.

3560
03:10:31,639 --> 03:10:33,879
We are going to narrow this down to three.

3561
03:10:33,879 --> 03:10:36,120
To be clear, you can't decide 15 wins.

3562
03:10:37,319 --> 03:10:38,760
The penultimate round is here.

3563
03:10:38,760 --> 03:10:39,399
Let's, let's see.

3564
03:10:42,760 --> 03:10:47,239
Guys, can we please bring out number one to read the JermaCraft copypasta

3565
03:10:47,239 --> 03:10:48,760
to see if they have what it takes.

3566
03:10:49,399 --> 03:10:51,319
Yeah, I just want to see you read the ancient text.

3567
03:10:51,319 --> 03:10:52,040
Hello.

3568
03:10:52,040 --> 03:10:52,520
Hello.

3569
03:10:52,520 --> 03:10:53,239
Welcome back.

3570
03:10:53,239 --> 03:10:54,750
Hello.

3571
03:10:54,750 --> 03:10:58,510
Why do you have like a, like a, like a water, like office water?

3572
03:10:58,510 --> 03:10:59,309
It's like a Dixie cup.

3573
03:10:59,870 --> 03:11:00,829
It's cider.

3574
03:11:00,829 --> 03:11:01,709
It's cider, okay.

3575
03:11:03,520 --> 03:11:05,520
Are you ready to read the JermaCraft copypasta?

3576
03:11:05,520 --> 03:11:08,079
Number one, you've made it this far, are you ready?

3577
03:11:08,079 --> 03:11:10,000
Is it an iPhone 12 Max or 11 Max?

3578
03:11:10,000 --> 03:11:13,280
Don't say that iPhone, who cares, Android, doesn't matter.

3579
03:11:14,000 --> 03:11:16,729
It's a private sponsorship I have.

3580
03:11:16,729 --> 03:11:17,290
Shut up.

3581
03:11:18,940 --> 03:11:20,700
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

3582
03:11:20,700 --> 03:11:26,700
Welcome to episode one of JermaCraft, the series where I play Minecraft.

3583
03:11:26,700 --> 03:11:29,340
This is going to be a single player let's play.

3584
03:11:29,340 --> 03:11:35,659
And when I say let's play, I use that term pretty loosely because I am an idiot in this game.

3585
03:11:35,659 --> 03:11:36,860
You're going to see lots of fails.

3586
03:11:36,860 --> 03:11:39,899
You're going to see lots of triumphs, at least a moment.

3587
03:11:39,899 --> 03:11:43,340
So go grab yourself a nice hot cup of coffee, hot cup of cocoa.

3588
03:11:43,340 --> 03:11:45,579
I got apple cider right here, freshly brewed.

3589
03:11:45,579 --> 03:11:46,379
Let me take a sip.

3590
03:11:48,299 --> 03:11:49,340
That is some good cider.

3591
03:11:50,700 --> 03:11:51,739
You said that?

3592
03:11:51,739 --> 03:11:53,739
You said that's some good cider.

3593
03:11:53,739 --> 03:11:54,379
He nailed it.

3594
03:11:55,180 --> 03:11:55,659
You nailed it.

3595
03:11:55,659 --> 03:11:56,299
That was amazing.

3596
03:11:57,100 --> 03:11:58,059
Oh, you nailed it.

3597
03:11:58,059 --> 03:11:59,979
Man, I would not watch you play Minecraft.

3598
03:12:00,620 --> 03:12:01,420
Why would you play?

3599
03:12:01,420 --> 03:12:03,340
Why would you watch me play Minecraft?

3600
03:12:03,340 --> 03:12:04,780
It's a fucking horrible content.

3601
03:12:04,780 --> 03:12:08,860
I mean, either of you, based on what I just heard, I'm not watching either of you.

3602
03:12:08,860 --> 03:12:10,299
If you, okay, wait, wait, number one.

3603
03:12:10,299 --> 03:12:10,860
Yes.

3604
03:12:10,860 --> 03:12:11,979
If you took over.

3605
03:12:11,979 --> 03:12:12,620
Yes.

3606
03:12:12,620 --> 03:12:15,659
What would be your number one video game to play on the first day?

3607
03:12:18,110 --> 03:12:19,389
Minecraft, maybe?

3608
03:12:19,389 --> 03:12:20,909
No, no, I don't want to press it.

3609
03:12:20,909 --> 03:12:21,549
I don't want to press it.

3610
03:12:22,430 --> 03:12:23,309
Say anything else.

3611
03:12:23,309 --> 03:12:24,270
Number one, please.

3612
03:12:24,270 --> 03:12:25,229
You get a redo.

3613
03:12:25,229 --> 03:12:26,190
It's a really good question.

3614
03:12:26,989 --> 03:12:29,069
Don't say Dark Souls either, because nobody got through them too early.

3615
03:12:29,069 --> 03:12:29,629
Call of Duty?

3616
03:12:29,629 --> 03:12:30,350
I'm just kidding.

3617
03:12:30,350 --> 03:12:31,309
Don't say that either.

3618
03:12:31,309 --> 03:12:32,030
It's a good gag.

3619
03:12:32,829 --> 03:12:33,629
But for real though, now.

3620
03:12:33,629 --> 03:12:36,909
If the brand were to live forever and you took it on.

3621
03:12:36,909 --> 03:12:38,829
Geez, you know.

3622
03:12:38,829 --> 03:12:39,790
First game you'd play.

3623
03:12:40,670 --> 03:12:41,629
Death's Door.

3624
03:12:41,629 --> 03:12:43,229
Holy shit, that's a pass for me.

3625
03:12:43,950 --> 03:12:44,909
I don't even know what that is.

3626
03:12:46,350 --> 03:12:47,870
You got to play Death's Door.

3627
03:12:47,870 --> 03:12:48,590
The bird?

3628
03:12:48,590 --> 03:12:48,989
Why?

3629
03:12:48,989 --> 03:12:49,549
The bird.

3630
03:12:49,549 --> 03:12:50,030
The bird.

3631
03:12:50,909 --> 03:12:51,389
So good.

3632
03:12:52,350 --> 03:12:53,309
That's the bird, yeah.

3633
03:12:53,870 --> 03:12:54,750
You know what this is?

3634
03:12:54,750 --> 03:12:55,309
Yeah.

3635
03:12:55,309 --> 03:12:56,270
What's Death's Door?

3636
03:12:56,270 --> 03:12:59,549
You're a bird and it's like a roguelike and you got to go around and.

3637
03:12:59,549 --> 03:13:01,389
Made by the guys that made Titan Souls.

3638
03:13:01,389 --> 03:13:02,270
I don't know if you ever played that.

3639
03:13:02,270 --> 03:13:04,110
Yeah, you're kind of like a Reaper bird.

3640
03:13:04,110 --> 03:13:04,510
Chat.

3641
03:13:05,309 --> 03:13:07,309
It wasn't made 40 years ago so you might have missed it.

3642
03:13:07,309 --> 03:13:08,670
Or Nobody Saves the World.

3643
03:13:08,670 --> 03:13:10,510
That's another one maybe I would play.

3644
03:13:10,510 --> 03:13:11,149
Heard of this one?

3645
03:13:11,149 --> 03:13:11,229
Number one.

3646
03:13:11,229 --> 03:13:13,069
Jeremy's known for a lot of his bigger streams.

3647
03:13:13,069 --> 03:13:16,510
What big ideas would you bring to the table in 2022 and 2023?

3648
03:13:16,510 --> 03:13:16,829
Exactly.

3649
03:13:16,829 --> 03:13:18,829
Wow, that's really putting me on the spot.

3650
03:13:19,790 --> 03:13:28,350
Let's see, maybe how about while I would be playing I would also be getting a massage.

3651
03:13:28,350 --> 03:13:30,430
That's actually pretty funny.

3652
03:13:30,430 --> 03:13:31,709
Yeah, okay.

3653
03:13:31,709 --> 03:13:32,350
He goes through.

3654
03:13:32,350 --> 03:13:34,110
Okay, are we all getting a question?

3655
03:13:34,110 --> 03:13:37,229
I think if you have a question to ask him that's fine.

3656
03:13:37,229 --> 03:13:37,709
That's funny.

3657
03:13:37,709 --> 03:13:38,510
That's actually funny.

3658
03:13:39,950 --> 03:13:40,750
That's funny.

3659
03:13:40,750 --> 03:13:45,629
If you could approve upon one thing the current Jerma might not excel at,

3660
03:13:45,629 --> 03:13:47,239
where do you think you could do better?

3661
03:13:47,239 --> 03:13:50,079
I don't think I would stutter as much.

3662
03:13:50,079 --> 03:13:50,959
Oh, shit.

3663
03:13:51,040 --> 03:13:53,440
Okay, I am getting close to pressing the button.

3664
03:13:53,440 --> 03:13:54,159
Hey, they asked.

3665
03:13:54,159 --> 03:13:54,799
You know, I'm sorry.

3666
03:13:54,799 --> 03:13:56,319
I just did not ask much.

3667
03:13:56,319 --> 03:13:58,239
I was still, you know, stuttering like a little.

3668
03:13:59,040 --> 03:13:59,520
That was good.

3669
03:13:59,520 --> 03:13:59,920
I like that.

3670
03:13:59,920 --> 03:14:04,879
I want a look at me and I want it good and I want it now.

3671
03:14:07,180 --> 03:14:07,739
Look at me.

3672
03:14:10,489 --> 03:14:10,969
He goes on.

3673
03:14:13,229 --> 03:14:15,629
Welcome to the final round number one.

3674
03:14:15,629 --> 03:14:16,110
Fuck yeah.

3675
03:14:16,989 --> 03:14:17,549
Love that guy.

3676
03:14:17,549 --> 03:14:19,389
If number one goes on to the final.

3677
03:14:19,389 --> 03:14:21,950
So let the first guy go through but he just did so well.

3678
03:14:21,950 --> 03:14:22,590
It was so good.

3679
03:14:23,549 --> 03:14:24,510
It was actually very good.

3680
03:14:25,469 --> 03:14:27,309
I'm going to hit the next guy with harder questions.

3681
03:14:27,309 --> 03:14:27,709
Please do.

3682
03:14:27,709 --> 03:14:28,350
Tougher questions.

3683
03:14:29,309 --> 03:14:31,450
So number two we got coming out here.

3684
03:14:31,450 --> 03:14:32,809
We have a package for number two.

3685
03:14:33,770 --> 03:14:36,329
I guess some life story or something we have to hear.

3686
03:14:37,129 --> 03:14:39,770
Like all these shows do, you hear their fucking life story.

3687
03:14:39,770 --> 03:14:40,170
Great.

3688
03:14:40,170 --> 03:14:42,809
Can't wait to hear their life story and everybody cry.

3689
03:14:44,010 --> 03:14:44,569
Go ahead and play it.

3690
03:14:46,670 --> 03:14:49,950
I'm Austin S. Faulkner and I've been running a farm for the last 30 years

3691
03:14:49,950 --> 03:14:50,829
down in the heart of the country.

3692
03:14:51,389 --> 03:14:53,629
I come from a long lineage of farmers and we've owned this

3693
03:14:53,629 --> 03:14:55,950
plot of land for the last 200 years.

3694
03:14:55,950 --> 03:15:00,110
Running it with my wife Abby and my two sons Gregory and Johnny has been an

3695
03:15:00,110 --> 03:15:01,549
absolute joy.

3696
03:15:01,549 --> 03:15:04,989
Gregory, my youngest, absolutely loves this guy.

3697
03:15:04,989 --> 03:15:10,430
Shouting phrases like look at me and muck my ass at the dinner table.

3698
03:15:10,430 --> 03:15:14,670
I don't quite know what that means but my son keeps telling me that this guy's a

3699
03:15:14,670 --> 03:15:18,270
millionaire saying things like this on the internet every week.

3700
03:15:18,270 --> 03:15:22,590
Teaching today's youth how to properly run a farm through my streaming would be

3701
03:15:22,590 --> 03:15:27,629
a dream come true and I heard that German's retiring so I feel like I'm

3702
03:15:27,629 --> 03:15:39,850
right now in a good job.

3703
03:15:39,850 --> 03:15:41,129
Okay, so let's go ahead.

3704
03:15:41,129 --> 03:15:41,610
All right.

3705
03:15:42,409 --> 03:15:43,979
Let's bring our number two.

3706
03:15:43,979 --> 03:15:45,819
Number two, welcome to the stream.

3707
03:15:45,819 --> 03:15:46,379
How are you?

3708
03:15:46,379 --> 03:15:47,420
Welcome for the third time.

3709
03:15:47,420 --> 03:15:48,139
I'm doing well.

3710
03:15:49,180 --> 03:15:49,899
You got a farm.

3711
03:15:49,899 --> 03:15:51,180
We just heard about that.

3712
03:15:51,180 --> 03:15:52,139
Yeah, it's a beautiful farm.

3713
03:15:52,139 --> 03:15:53,260
You should come visit sometime.

3714
03:15:53,260 --> 03:15:53,899
I would love to.

3715
03:15:53,899 --> 03:15:54,540
You're retiring, right?

3716
03:15:54,540 --> 03:15:55,659
Hey, fresh milk?

3717
03:15:55,659 --> 03:15:57,260
We can trade spots.

3718
03:15:57,260 --> 03:15:57,979
You could run the farm.

3719
03:15:57,979 --> 03:15:58,780
I could run your channel.

3720
03:15:59,579 --> 03:16:00,379
Hey, that's easy.

3721
03:16:00,379 --> 03:16:02,059
25% goes to me.

3722
03:16:02,059 --> 03:16:04,379
Are you not concerned how the farm would end up

3723
03:16:04,379 --> 03:16:05,579
if Jerma were in control?

3724
03:16:07,100 --> 03:16:10,700
I think there'd be a lot of more muck-a-ass on the farm.

3725
03:16:10,700 --> 03:16:14,299
That's true.

3726
03:16:14,299 --> 03:16:15,100
He said muck-a-ass.

3727
03:16:15,100 --> 03:16:16,219
Everybody likes him.

3728
03:16:16,219 --> 03:16:16,860
Everybody likes him.

3729
03:16:16,860 --> 03:16:17,579
He said muck-a-ass.

3730
03:16:17,579 --> 03:16:18,540
Do the Pog face.

3731
03:16:19,260 --> 03:16:19,979
Well, no.

3732
03:16:19,979 --> 03:16:20,940
That's not even close.

3733
03:16:20,940 --> 03:16:21,500
Ew.

3734
03:16:21,500 --> 03:16:22,459
No, you didn't like that?

3735
03:16:22,459 --> 03:16:23,260
Okay.

3736
03:16:23,260 --> 03:16:24,219
I really didn't like that.

3737
03:16:24,219 --> 03:16:25,100
Did you say no?

3738
03:16:26,620 --> 03:16:26,940
Sorry.

3739
03:16:26,940 --> 03:16:29,440
Anyway, if you want to do your monologue.

3740
03:16:29,440 --> 03:16:31,440
Can we please hear JermaCraft copypasta, please?

3741
03:16:32,079 --> 03:16:33,520
And it better be fucking good.

3742
03:16:34,319 --> 03:16:36,000
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

3743
03:16:36,000 --> 03:16:39,120
And welcome to the very first episode of JermaCraft,

3744
03:16:39,120 --> 03:16:41,440
the series where I play Minecraft.

3745
03:16:41,440 --> 03:16:44,399
Now, this is going to be a single player let's play.

3746
03:16:44,399 --> 03:16:48,399
And when I say let's play, I use that term pretty loosely.

3747
03:16:48,399 --> 03:16:50,959
I'll pull it back.

3748
03:16:50,959 --> 03:16:52,559
Because I'm an idiot in this game.

3749
03:16:53,280 --> 03:16:56,239
Now, you're going to see a lot of fails and a lot of triumphs,

3750
03:16:56,239 --> 03:16:57,200
I am hoping.

3751
03:16:57,200 --> 03:17:00,559
So grab yourself a nice hot cup of coffee, hot cup of cocoa.

3752
03:17:00,639 --> 03:17:03,680
I got a glass of apple cider right here, freshly brewed.

3753
03:17:04,479 --> 03:17:05,280
Let me take a sip.

3754
03:17:07,280 --> 03:17:10,479
That's a really good fake sip noise.

3755
03:17:12,079 --> 03:17:13,680
That was a good sip noise.

3756
03:17:13,680 --> 03:17:14,180
All right.

3757
03:17:14,639 --> 03:17:15,120
Thank you.

3758
03:17:15,680 --> 03:17:16,239
Thank you.

3759
03:17:16,239 --> 03:17:17,600
That was a very good sip noise.

3760
03:17:18,159 --> 03:17:18,479
Thank you.

3761
03:17:18,479 --> 03:17:19,120
I appreciate that.

3762
03:17:19,120 --> 03:17:19,600
I worked hard.

3763
03:17:19,600 --> 03:17:20,079
What do we got?

3764
03:17:20,079 --> 03:17:21,360
We got two and two here.

3765
03:17:21,360 --> 03:17:22,399
Can I field a question?

3766
03:17:22,399 --> 03:17:23,280
I would love to field a question.

3767
03:17:24,159 --> 03:17:27,040
I think a lot of Jerma's content revolves around creative ideas.

3768
03:17:27,680 --> 03:17:30,559
What would you do about the situation in Ukraine right now?

3769
03:17:30,559 --> 03:17:31,280
Jesus Christ.

3770
03:17:32,799 --> 03:17:35,680
It's kind of a touchy subject, but...

3771
03:17:36,399 --> 03:17:37,840
Just say, look at me, and it'll be fine.

3772
03:17:37,840 --> 03:17:39,360
Yeah, I'll just say, look at me.

3773
03:17:40,559 --> 03:17:40,799
No.

3774
03:17:42,079 --> 03:17:42,959
That's what you do?

3775
03:17:42,959 --> 03:17:44,399
You go to Ukraine, you go, look at me.

3776
03:17:45,040 --> 03:17:45,920
Look at me.

3777
03:17:45,920 --> 03:17:47,680
Distracted from all their problems now.

3778
03:17:47,680 --> 03:17:48,079
You know what?

3779
03:17:48,079 --> 03:17:49,840
Biden and Putin kiss in harmony.

3780
03:17:50,639 --> 03:17:51,120
Oh, boy.

3781
03:17:52,639 --> 03:17:53,719
Yeah.

3782
03:17:53,719 --> 03:17:55,159
I thought so, please.

3783
03:17:55,159 --> 03:17:56,840
Doctor, I think he's got what it takes.

3784
03:17:56,840 --> 03:18:00,760
Well, I'm sure that he's arrived farm fresh.

3785
03:18:01,879 --> 03:18:08,889
I do think that you have talent.

3786
03:18:09,690 --> 03:18:13,290
I just don't know if it's the kind of idiocy that we need.

3787
03:18:13,290 --> 03:18:14,329
Oh, no.

3788
03:18:16,110 --> 03:18:17,149
What the fuck?

3789
03:18:17,149 --> 03:18:19,950
Yeah, I'm going to remain a no based on your foreign policy.

3790
03:18:19,950 --> 03:18:20,190
No.

3791
03:18:21,709 --> 03:18:22,909
Well, I tried.

3792
03:18:22,909 --> 03:18:25,950
Number two, you were such a great presence.

3793
03:18:26,510 --> 03:18:27,629
You guys don't know anything.

3794
03:18:27,629 --> 03:18:28,350
What do you know about me?

3795
03:18:28,350 --> 03:18:29,870
We got to eliminate someone, all right?

3796
03:18:29,870 --> 03:18:32,590
And this guy's just walking around, look at me, like anyone can do it.

3797
03:18:32,590 --> 03:18:33,549
Am I the next Jerma?

3798
03:18:33,549 --> 03:18:34,510
Can I chime in?

3799
03:18:35,149 --> 03:18:37,229
This man's 36 with no kids.

3800
03:18:37,229 --> 03:18:37,709
Yeah.

3801
03:18:37,709 --> 03:18:40,270
You have a future ahead of you and it's your family.

3802
03:18:40,829 --> 03:18:44,350
There's a reason he's able to do this at 36 because he doesn't have one.

3803
03:18:45,229 --> 03:18:50,120
So we want someone who comes in to also not have a family that is more important.

3804
03:18:50,840 --> 03:18:54,510
I don't want to be tied down with real world issues.

3805
03:18:55,229 --> 03:18:56,590
You got to play video games all day.

3806
03:18:57,469 --> 03:18:58,590
What a loser would do.

3807
03:18:59,389 --> 03:18:59,950
You're a winner.

3808
03:19:00,989 --> 03:19:01,549
Thank you.

3809
03:19:01,549 --> 03:19:02,350
I appreciate that.

3810
03:19:03,309 --> 03:19:03,950
God bless.

3811
03:19:03,950 --> 03:19:04,430
Thanks for coming.

3812
03:19:04,430 --> 03:19:05,229
Have a good one.

3813
03:19:05,229 --> 03:19:06,510
Number two, thank you so much.

3814
03:19:06,510 --> 03:19:07,709
Here you go, keep that bill coming.

3815
03:19:07,709 --> 03:19:09,790
I feel great right now.

3816
03:19:09,790 --> 03:19:10,750
What a great feeling.

3817
03:19:10,750 --> 03:19:12,190
What happened to the kids?

3818
03:19:12,190 --> 03:19:13,629
What a great feeling.

3819
03:19:13,629 --> 03:19:17,709
I got 10 years on everybody at this table besides, of course, the wonderful doctor.

3820
03:19:19,069 --> 03:19:21,629
It depends on what you mean 10 years on.

3821
03:19:21,629 --> 03:19:22,110
It's true.

3822
03:19:22,829 --> 03:19:24,750
You're going to take 10 years from all of us.

3823
03:19:25,549 --> 03:19:25,950
All right.

3824
03:19:27,229 --> 03:19:29,950
I don't have kids, but you know, I'm thinking, I'm thinking about it.

3825
03:19:29,950 --> 03:19:30,670
I'm thinking.

3826
03:19:30,670 --> 03:19:32,750
I don't have kids, so I can spend a few in jail.

3827
03:19:32,750 --> 03:19:34,989
One day, you know, I'm 36, 37 this year.

3828
03:19:34,989 --> 03:19:36,989
You know, you think about kids, one day, one day.

3829
03:19:37,629 --> 03:19:38,510
One day.

3830
03:19:38,510 --> 03:19:39,870
Maybe we can have one soon.

3831
03:19:39,870 --> 03:19:42,750
Get your hands off of me before I switch seats with...

3832
03:19:43,870 --> 03:19:46,190
Turn your ex off before we get in trouble by production.

3833
03:19:46,829 --> 03:19:47,870
All right, number four.

3834
03:19:47,870 --> 03:19:50,430
Please come out, number four, for your German craft copybasta.

3835
03:19:51,229 --> 03:19:54,860
What's cat dog?

3836
03:19:54,860 --> 03:19:55,899
It's cat dog.

3837
03:19:55,899 --> 03:20:00,989
You, okay, before you go, everybody has put you through but me.

3838
03:20:00,989 --> 03:20:01,549
Yeah.

3839
03:20:01,549 --> 03:20:07,309
And you're doing like a really like caveman interpretation of my channel and me and...

3840
03:20:07,309 --> 03:20:08,670
It's so true.

3841
03:20:08,670 --> 03:20:10,829
I don't, I don't think that's like appropriate.

3842
03:20:10,829 --> 03:20:12,430
I don't think I'm that stupid.

3843
03:20:12,430 --> 03:20:13,950
But you made it all the way to the final.

3844
03:20:13,950 --> 03:20:15,629
I don't think you're stupid.

3845
03:20:15,629 --> 03:20:16,350
Do you think I'm stupid?

3846
03:20:16,350 --> 03:20:17,790
I don't think you're stupid.

3847
03:20:17,790 --> 03:20:18,670
What do you think I am?

3848
03:20:18,670 --> 03:20:19,709
I think you're very smart.

3849
03:20:20,270 --> 03:20:20,430
Okay.

3850
03:20:20,430 --> 03:20:22,110
It's like Joaquin Phoenix in showbiz.

3851
03:20:22,110 --> 03:20:22,750
I like you.

3852
03:20:26,190 --> 03:20:26,750
Number four.

3853
03:20:28,030 --> 03:20:28,350
Oops.

3854
03:20:29,149 --> 03:20:32,030
Can you give us a German craft copybasta, please?

3855
03:20:33,309 --> 03:20:34,750
If I may, please.

3856
03:20:35,549 --> 03:20:37,069
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

3857
03:20:37,069 --> 03:20:40,190
Welcome to episode one of German craft.

3858
03:20:40,190 --> 03:20:42,909
This is the series where I play Minecraft.

3859
03:20:42,909 --> 03:20:45,469
This is a single player let's play.

3860
03:20:45,469 --> 03:20:51,389
And when I say let's play, I use that term pretty loosely because I am an idiot in this game.

3861
03:20:51,389 --> 03:20:52,750
You're going to see lots of fails.

3862
03:20:52,750 --> 03:20:54,909
You're going to see lots of triumphs.

3863
03:20:54,909 --> 03:20:55,709
At least I'm hoping.

3864
03:20:56,350 --> 03:20:59,469
So go grab yourself a nice hot cup of coffee, hot cup of cocoa.

3865
03:20:59,469 --> 03:21:01,389
I got apple cider right here, freshly brewed.

3866
03:21:01,389 --> 03:21:02,110
Let me take a ship.

3867
03:21:07,790 --> 03:21:08,909
I thought he was pretty good.

3868
03:21:08,909 --> 03:21:09,790
Let me take a ship.

3869
03:21:10,590 --> 03:21:11,709
Yeah, but he's got a mic.

3870
03:21:11,709 --> 03:21:12,590
He's got a microphone in his hand.

3871
03:21:12,590 --> 03:21:13,549
He's Sean Connery.

3872
03:21:13,549 --> 03:21:14,270
Was it take?

3873
03:21:15,149 --> 03:21:15,709
Nevermind.

3874
03:21:15,709 --> 03:21:16,350
Was it?

3875
03:21:16,350 --> 03:21:16,670
Was it?

3876
03:21:16,670 --> 03:21:17,469
What?

3877
03:21:17,469 --> 03:21:18,510
No way.

3878
03:21:18,510 --> 03:21:18,989
No way.

3879
03:21:18,989 --> 03:21:21,870
You don't put this guy all the way through and then get him out in the last round.

3880
03:21:21,870 --> 03:21:23,229
There was no dog bark.

3881
03:21:23,229 --> 03:21:24,030
Where was the meow?

3882
03:21:24,030 --> 03:21:25,389
I thought it was a ship.

3883
03:21:25,389 --> 03:21:26,350
No, it's not a ship.

3884
03:21:26,350 --> 03:21:27,870
But you're actually pretty good.

3885
03:21:27,870 --> 03:21:29,069
You're actually really good.

3886
03:21:29,069 --> 03:21:30,909
I don't know if I agree with these three.

3887
03:21:30,909 --> 03:21:32,110
OK, so I'm sorry.

3888
03:21:32,110 --> 03:21:33,389
We wanted to get him through.

3889
03:21:33,389 --> 03:21:34,590
You whined and kvecht.

3890
03:21:34,590 --> 03:21:35,629
Now we want to eliminate him.

3891
03:21:35,629 --> 03:21:36,829
And you're whining and kvechting.

3892
03:21:36,829 --> 03:21:38,829
Do you want us to judge or do you want to tell us what to do?

3893
03:21:38,829 --> 03:21:41,229
That was a good German craft coffee pasta.

3894
03:21:41,229 --> 03:21:42,600
Hit it with some questions.

3895
03:21:42,600 --> 03:21:43,000
Tell me.

3896
03:21:43,000 --> 03:21:43,239
OK.

3897
03:21:43,239 --> 03:21:43,719
Convince me.

3898
03:21:45,280 --> 03:21:46,159
If you were...

3899
03:21:46,879 --> 03:21:51,120
OK, so you're in line at the Dunkin' Donuts drive-thru.

3900
03:21:51,680 --> 03:21:52,719
You're number four in line.

3901
03:21:52,719 --> 03:21:53,920
That's a good question.

3902
03:21:53,920 --> 03:21:54,479
Good question.

3903
03:21:54,479 --> 03:21:55,520
That's a good question.

3904
03:21:55,520 --> 03:21:56,879
You're number four in line.

3905
03:21:56,879 --> 03:21:57,760
You're at Dunkin' Donuts.

3906
03:21:57,760 --> 03:21:58,319
You're at Donkeys.

3907
03:21:58,959 --> 03:22:03,680
You want a large iced blueberry with easy ice.

3908
03:22:04,559 --> 03:22:05,680
You're number four in line.

3909
03:22:06,700 --> 03:22:12,059
Do you, when you get to the counter, are you happy or are you sad?

3910
03:22:12,059 --> 03:22:15,899
How do you interact with the barista at Dunkin' Donuts?

3911
03:22:16,860 --> 03:22:18,059
Not what I thought the question would be.

3912
03:22:19,659 --> 03:22:21,340
I just spit everywhere.

3913
03:22:21,340 --> 03:22:22,139
Say it, don't spray it.

3914
03:22:22,700 --> 03:22:23,020
Sad.

3915
03:22:23,739 --> 03:22:24,299
You're sad.

3916
03:22:24,299 --> 03:22:24,540
Why?

3917
03:22:24,540 --> 03:22:25,340
Sad.

3918
03:22:25,340 --> 03:22:26,620
Because I'm number four.

3919
03:22:27,500 --> 03:22:30,059
All I've ever wanted to be is number one in Germany.

3920
03:22:30,940 --> 03:22:36,079
And I'm sad for the blueberries because the blueberries didn't have to die for me.

3921
03:22:37,120 --> 03:22:37,840
Why are they dying?

3922
03:22:37,840 --> 03:22:38,799
They deserve to live.

3923
03:22:38,799 --> 03:22:39,920
Why are you saying right?

3924
03:22:39,920 --> 03:22:40,239
OK.

3925
03:22:41,280 --> 03:22:43,840
And I'm sad that they would serve it to me.

3926
03:22:43,840 --> 03:22:45,200
That they would agree to serve it to me.

3927
03:22:45,200 --> 03:22:47,760
But wait, would you drink the whole thing in an hour?

3928
03:22:48,559 --> 03:22:49,040
Fuck yeah.

3929
03:22:52,840 --> 03:22:54,360
It takes me six hours to drink coffee.

3930
03:22:55,450 --> 03:22:57,530
I drink a full coffee in about six or seven hours.

3931
03:22:57,530 --> 03:22:58,090
That is true.

3932
03:22:58,090 --> 03:22:59,450
Also, what was the whole blueberry thing?

3933
03:22:59,450 --> 03:23:00,569
Are we going to just glaze over that?

3934
03:23:00,569 --> 03:23:02,170
Are you sad for the blueberries?

3935
03:23:02,170 --> 03:23:03,450
But I mean, you harvest them.

3936
03:23:03,450 --> 03:23:03,930
You take them.

3937
03:23:03,930 --> 03:23:05,049
You take their lives, you know?

3938
03:23:05,049 --> 03:23:05,290
No.

3939
03:23:05,930 --> 03:23:07,049
You take their lives.

3940
03:23:07,049 --> 03:23:07,690
I don't.

3941
03:23:07,690 --> 03:23:08,809
I mean, sir, you're a vegan.

3942
03:23:08,809 --> 03:23:11,930
Sorry, doctor, do blueberries have sentient lives?

3943
03:23:13,370 --> 03:23:15,229
I think they're plants.

3944
03:23:16,190 --> 03:23:26,670
And I have to tell you that, you know, I don't know if you are able to go through for me.

3945
03:23:26,670 --> 03:23:28,270
I'd love to send you through.

3946
03:23:28,270 --> 03:23:29,149
You know what I can do?

3947
03:23:29,629 --> 03:23:32,110
I can actually give you a referral for therapy.

3948
03:23:33,639 --> 03:23:34,139
Yeah.

3949
03:23:34,840 --> 03:23:35,399
If you need it.

3950
03:23:36,040 --> 03:23:40,120
I'll be right back here in the back of the stage after the show.

3951
03:23:40,120 --> 03:23:40,620
Okay.

3952
03:23:41,239 --> 03:23:42,120
That's great.

3953
03:23:42,120 --> 03:23:42,840
Okay, sir.

3954
03:23:42,840 --> 03:23:43,399
Yeah, sorry.

3955
03:23:44,680 --> 03:23:46,120
So that's one, two.

3956
03:23:46,120 --> 03:23:47,000
Doctor, is that a no?

3957
03:23:50,280 --> 03:23:50,760
There it is.

3958
03:23:51,559 --> 03:23:53,000
Okay, I was confused.

3959
03:23:53,000 --> 03:23:53,639
Number four.

3960
03:23:53,639 --> 03:23:54,680
Oh, okay, all four.

3961
03:23:54,680 --> 03:23:55,399
I don't know.

3962
03:23:55,399 --> 03:23:57,159
You're, I think you're out.

3963
03:23:57,159 --> 03:23:58,680
Number four, I think that's always need to see.

3964
03:24:00,200 --> 03:24:00,920
I got it.

3965
03:24:00,920 --> 03:24:01,479
I'm sorry.

3966
03:24:01,479 --> 03:24:02,040
I'm sorry.

3967
03:24:02,040 --> 03:24:02,920
Motherfucker.

3968
03:24:02,920 --> 03:24:03,639
Don't pray.

3969
03:24:04,280 --> 03:24:05,639
But don't be so mad.

3970
03:24:05,639 --> 03:24:07,479
By the way, my car is not in the parking lot.

3971
03:24:07,479 --> 03:24:09,399
So don't like, it's unhinged.

3972
03:24:09,399 --> 03:24:10,760
My car is not in the parking lot.

3973
03:24:12,280 --> 03:24:13,719
I think his car is in the parking lot.

3974
03:24:13,719 --> 03:24:19,559
If you want to key his, he's got a green sedan and it's got a vanity plate.

3975
03:24:19,559 --> 03:24:21,719
It says a path of exile.

3976
03:24:22,600 --> 03:24:26,280
Do you know like two things about me and one of them is not even true?

3977
03:24:27,079 --> 03:24:29,159
I don't, I don't have a driver's license.

3978
03:24:31,149 --> 03:24:33,629
Oh, you brought me on because I've known you for so long.

3979
03:24:33,629 --> 03:24:34,750
I know you better than anyone.

3980
03:24:34,750 --> 03:24:35,709
Those are the path of exile license plate.

3981
03:24:35,709 --> 03:24:36,209
Who am I?

3982
03:24:37,870 --> 03:24:40,510
Can we, can we bring out number eight, please?

3983
03:24:40,510 --> 03:24:41,870
Eight should be coming out right now.

3984
03:24:41,870 --> 03:24:44,670
You have the big suss guy license plate with your Jeep Wrangler.

3985
03:24:46,729 --> 03:24:48,239
Number eight.

3986
03:24:50,719 --> 03:24:51,280
Yeah.

3987
03:24:51,280 --> 03:24:52,319
All right, there it is.

3988
03:24:52,319 --> 03:24:52,799
All right.

3989
03:24:52,799 --> 03:24:53,760
Made it all the way to here.

3990
03:24:55,040 --> 03:24:57,440
Hi, number eight.

3991
03:24:57,440 --> 03:24:58,159
Welcome back.

3992
03:24:58,159 --> 03:24:58,659
Hello.

3993
03:24:59,440 --> 03:25:00,079
Hello.

3994
03:25:00,159 --> 03:25:03,520
We are ready to hear your Germacraft copypasta interpretation.

3995
03:25:04,239 --> 03:25:05,920
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

3996
03:25:05,920 --> 03:25:10,559
Welcome to episode one of Germacraft series where I play Minecraft.

3997
03:25:11,360 --> 03:25:14,030
He forgot his line.

3998
03:25:14,030 --> 03:25:16,190
He forgot his line.

3999
03:25:16,190 --> 03:25:22,270
So when I say let's play, I touch on very loosely because I'm an idiot at this game.

4000
03:25:22,270 --> 03:25:26,030
It's going to be a lot of triumphs, a lot of fails, or at least I'm hoping.

4001
03:25:26,030 --> 03:25:27,950
So go grab yourself a nice hot cup of coffee.

4002
03:25:33,440 --> 03:25:38,200
I pulled back.

4003
03:25:38,200 --> 03:25:40,280
I want to reiterate something he said.

4004
03:25:40,280 --> 03:25:41,000
Yeah.

4005
03:25:41,000 --> 03:25:43,239
It's going to be a lot of triumphs, a lot of fails.

4006
03:25:43,879 --> 03:25:46,760
I'm hoping he's hoping for a lot of fails.

4007
03:25:48,280 --> 03:25:49,319
Entertainment value.

4008
03:25:49,319 --> 03:25:50,440
That's entertainment value.

4009
03:25:50,440 --> 03:25:51,000
He's right.

4010
03:25:51,000 --> 03:25:52,440
I don't think that's.

4011
03:25:52,440 --> 03:25:52,840
All right.

4012
03:25:53,799 --> 03:25:54,680
What have we got?

4013
03:25:54,680 --> 03:25:57,159
I think he is tarnishing your legacy.

4014
03:25:57,159 --> 03:25:57,559
Why?

4015
03:25:57,559 --> 03:25:58,200
For what?

4016
03:25:58,200 --> 03:25:58,920
I would never.

4017
03:25:58,920 --> 03:26:01,479
By misspeaking, you mixed up a couple words.

4018
03:26:01,479 --> 03:26:02,360
You had to look.

4019
03:26:02,360 --> 03:26:02,920
But it's hard.

4020
03:26:02,920 --> 03:26:03,879
No one has had to look yet.

4021
03:26:03,959 --> 03:26:05,159
You had to look.

4022
03:26:05,159 --> 03:26:06,120
I got to call a challenge.

4023
03:26:07,079 --> 03:26:09,290
We probably can't get that back.

4024
03:26:09,290 --> 03:26:09,930
Yeah.

4025
03:26:09,930 --> 03:26:12,489
I'm just bringing a different new twist.

4026
03:26:12,489 --> 03:26:15,209
Everyone's looking for like what's the new about the new drama.

4027
03:26:15,209 --> 03:26:16,889
It's the new drama.

4028
03:26:16,889 --> 03:26:17,770
I like him.

4029
03:26:17,770 --> 03:26:19,290
I think he's got what it takes.

4030
03:26:19,290 --> 03:26:21,850
We're kind of bringing a new zass to it, making everyone, you know,

4031
03:26:21,850 --> 03:26:22,889
we're excited for something new.

4032
03:26:24,090 --> 03:26:25,209
Honestly, let me be honest with you.

4033
03:26:25,209 --> 03:26:27,770
Play the crying music if you can.

4034
03:26:29,209 --> 03:26:30,809
I think that's not crying music.

4035
03:26:30,809 --> 03:26:32,010
They can only cry to the song.

4036
03:26:32,010 --> 03:26:33,129
Crying music, crying music, please.

4037
03:26:33,850 --> 03:26:36,889
I think that honestly, you came up with the piano.

4038
03:26:37,530 --> 03:26:38,729
He had the rats.

4039
03:26:38,729 --> 03:26:40,489
Number one piano guy.

4040
03:26:40,489 --> 03:26:44,430
He had the rat song.

4041
03:26:44,430 --> 03:26:45,549
He knew the rat song.

4042
03:26:45,549 --> 03:26:47,790
Who knew the rat song out of anybody here?

4043
03:26:49,309 --> 03:26:52,590
He's the only one that knew the rat song.

4044
03:26:52,590 --> 03:26:53,709
And he did it by heart.

4045
03:26:55,229 --> 03:26:56,750
It's hard to cry.

4046
03:26:56,750 --> 03:27:00,110
I must admit I felt something for the rats.

4047
03:27:00,110 --> 03:27:00,989
I did.

4048
03:27:00,989 --> 03:27:02,909
That's why you were always a yes from me.

4049
03:27:02,909 --> 03:27:03,389
Me too.

4050
03:27:03,389 --> 03:27:05,530
Thank you, German.

4051
03:27:05,530 --> 03:27:07,049
I think you've convinced me.

4052
03:27:07,049 --> 03:27:09,610
His past failures make up for his current failures.

4053
03:27:09,610 --> 03:27:11,129
How do we get you two on board?

4054
03:27:16,030 --> 03:27:17,229
Do you want to do the rat song again?

4055
03:27:18,440 --> 03:27:19,879
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

4056
03:27:20,520 --> 03:27:22,170
What color is your hair?

4057
03:27:23,340 --> 03:27:23,819
Your color.

4058
03:27:24,379 --> 03:27:25,500
Your hair looks kind of black.

4059
03:27:27,100 --> 03:27:27,979
I'm pretty sure it's your color.

4060
03:27:27,979 --> 03:27:28,780
It's just the lighting.

4061
03:27:28,780 --> 03:27:30,379
I didn't pick that up the first few minutes.

4062
03:27:31,180 --> 03:27:35,520
You didn't pick that up that he is obviously brown.

4063
03:27:35,520 --> 03:27:36,239
It's kind of black.

4064
03:27:36,239 --> 03:27:36,959
It's kind of black.

4065
03:27:36,959 --> 03:27:37,520
Come on, German.

4066
03:27:37,520 --> 03:27:38,479
You're on my side.

4067
03:27:38,479 --> 03:27:38,799
You got me.

4068
03:27:38,799 --> 03:27:40,319
Oh, your hair is black.

4069
03:27:40,319 --> 03:27:40,959
Your hair is black.

4070
03:27:40,959 --> 03:27:41,680
Get the fuck out of here.

4071
03:27:42,319 --> 03:27:43,520
German, come on.

4072
03:27:43,520 --> 03:27:44,159
Some hair dye.

4073
03:27:44,159 --> 03:27:44,639
You heard him.

4074
03:27:44,639 --> 03:27:46,159
Get the fuck out of here, man.

4075
03:27:46,159 --> 03:27:47,200
Don't do it like that.

4076
03:27:47,200 --> 03:27:47,680
Sorry.

4077
03:27:47,680 --> 03:27:48,159
I'm sorry.

4078
03:27:48,159 --> 03:27:48,959
I got upset.

4079
03:27:48,959 --> 03:27:49,360
Your hair is black.

4080
03:27:49,360 --> 03:27:49,680
All right.

4081
03:27:49,680 --> 03:27:50,959
Behave yourself.

4082
03:27:50,959 --> 03:27:52,000
It was that four nos.

4083
03:27:52,799 --> 03:27:56,799
I'll take mine back just to be able to say to chat that I backtracked and I didn't give

4084
03:27:56,799 --> 03:28:00,879
you a no because I want to make sure people know that I'm on both sides and I never am

4085
03:28:00,879 --> 03:28:04,239
part of any argument that I always am on both sides of every argument.

4086
03:28:04,239 --> 03:28:06,000
So everyone agrees with me every time.

4087
03:28:06,639 --> 03:28:08,559
You know, so thank you for coming.

4088
03:28:09,360 --> 03:28:09,920
Appreciate it.

4089
03:28:11,180 --> 03:28:13,180
Always always correct on every argument.

4090
03:28:13,180 --> 03:28:16,459
You know, no, but I never on one side or the other when I'm on everybody's side.

4091
03:28:16,459 --> 03:28:18,059
You know, I love the song though.

4092
03:28:18,059 --> 03:28:19,100
It was a great song.

4093
03:28:19,100 --> 03:28:20,219
See you on Broadway.

4094
03:28:20,219 --> 03:28:22,299
Only person that knew the rat song.

4095
03:28:22,299 --> 03:28:23,340
Thank you so much.

4096
03:28:23,340 --> 03:28:23,979
Fuck you.

4097
03:28:23,979 --> 03:28:25,500
Fuck you for not knowing that.

4098
03:28:26,700 --> 03:28:27,819
I just didn't know he had black hair.

4099
03:28:27,819 --> 03:28:28,540
I thought it was one.

4100
03:28:28,540 --> 03:28:29,979
Yeah, that's the shame.

4101
03:28:29,979 --> 03:28:30,780
Hate those.

4102
03:28:30,780 --> 03:28:33,180
Can we bring out number nine, please?

4103
03:28:36,459 --> 03:28:37,020
Thanks for having me.

4104
03:28:38,219 --> 03:28:38,940
Welcome.

4105
03:28:38,940 --> 03:28:39,659
Welcome back.

4106
03:28:39,659 --> 03:28:40,139
Thank you.

4107
03:28:40,139 --> 03:28:40,940
How are you feeling?

4108
03:28:41,500 --> 03:28:41,899
Great.

4109
03:28:41,899 --> 03:28:43,100
Still shaking a little bit.

4110
03:28:43,100 --> 03:28:46,219
It might have been the three cups of coffee I've had today, but hey, yeah, we're here.

4111
03:28:46,219 --> 03:28:47,340
We're here and we're partying.

4112
03:28:47,340 --> 03:28:48,860
But not the crack that we all smoke before.

4113
03:28:50,379 --> 03:28:50,780
Never mind.

4114
03:28:50,780 --> 03:28:52,440
Just go ahead.

4115
03:28:52,440 --> 03:28:52,760
Go ahead.

4116
03:28:54,040 --> 03:28:58,200
If you want to do number nine, if you want to do German craft coffee pasta, I hope you're prepared.

4117
03:28:58,200 --> 03:28:58,680
I am.

4118
03:28:58,680 --> 03:28:59,319
I'm prepared.

4119
03:29:00,840 --> 03:29:01,319
Right there.

4120
03:29:01,959 --> 03:29:02,840
There's a camera here.

4121
03:29:03,799 --> 03:29:04,440
Cameras all over you.

4122
03:29:04,440 --> 03:29:04,840
Number nine.

4123
03:29:07,000 --> 03:29:08,200
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

4124
03:29:08,200 --> 03:29:11,319
Welcome to episode one of German craft.

4125
03:29:11,319 --> 03:29:13,399
The series where I play Minecraft.

4126
03:29:13,399 --> 03:29:14,920
This is going to be a single player.

4127
03:29:14,920 --> 03:29:15,879
Let's play.

4128
03:29:15,879 --> 03:29:21,399
And when I say let's play, I use that term pretty loosely because I'm an idiot in this game.

4129
03:29:21,399 --> 03:29:22,680
You're going to see lots of fails.

4130
03:29:22,680 --> 03:29:24,920
You're going to see lots of triumphs.

4131
03:29:24,920 --> 03:29:25,879
At least I'm hoping.

4132
03:29:25,879 --> 03:29:28,360
So go grab yourself a nice hot cup of coffee.

4133
03:29:28,360 --> 03:29:29,639
A cup of cocoa.

4134
03:29:29,639 --> 03:29:30,760
I got an upside right here.

4135
03:29:30,760 --> 03:29:31,479
Freshly brewed.

4136
03:29:31,479 --> 03:29:32,200
Let me take a sip.

4137
03:29:32,200 --> 03:29:35,069
That's some good cider.

4138
03:29:38,000 --> 03:29:38,959
That was amazing.

4139
03:29:38,959 --> 03:29:39,520
Amazing.

4140
03:29:39,520 --> 03:29:41,040
That was amazing.

4141
03:29:41,040 --> 03:29:41,600
Amazing.

4142
03:29:41,600 --> 03:29:42,159
Number nine.

4143
03:29:43,120 --> 03:29:44,319
I have one question.

4144
03:29:46,299 --> 03:29:47,819
Do you brew cider?

4145
03:29:47,819 --> 03:29:50,079
Is that like a thing?

4146
03:29:50,079 --> 03:29:50,799
You can, yeah.

4147
03:29:50,799 --> 03:29:52,159
I mean, like people brew tea.

4148
03:29:53,040 --> 03:29:54,000
Why would he know this?

4149
03:29:54,799 --> 03:29:56,639
Because he's going to be the next German.

4150
03:29:56,639 --> 03:30:01,040
You know, the answer to that question, I would brew my own cider.

4151
03:30:01,040 --> 03:30:02,159
And I would just figure it out.

4152
03:30:02,799 --> 03:30:04,479
You just got a pie in the face.

4153
03:30:04,479 --> 03:30:05,520
Clown got you.

4154
03:30:05,520 --> 03:30:06,399
Clown got you.

4155
03:30:06,399 --> 03:30:07,600
You get your hands off me.

4156
03:30:08,319 --> 03:30:09,600
You've been touching me all day.

4157
03:30:09,600 --> 03:30:10,559
I can't put my hands on you.

4158
03:30:13,760 --> 03:30:14,239
That was sharp.

4159
03:30:14,239 --> 03:30:14,719
He backed you up.

4160
03:30:14,719 --> 03:30:15,200
Do you hear that?

4161
03:30:15,200 --> 03:30:15,920
What did he say?

4162
03:30:15,920 --> 03:30:17,360
Is that a clown or what?

4163
03:30:17,360 --> 03:30:18,319
He backed you up real quick.

4164
03:30:18,319 --> 03:30:20,000
Oh, excuse me.

4165
03:30:20,959 --> 03:30:21,520
Number nine.

4166
03:30:22,079 --> 03:30:22,879
You got no access.

4167
03:30:23,840 --> 03:30:25,280
Yeah, we had some safety concerns.

4168
03:30:26,000 --> 03:30:26,319
I take time back.

4169
03:30:26,319 --> 03:30:27,840
Don't you appreciate that?

4170
03:30:27,840 --> 03:30:28,639
He's a dick, don't you?

4171
03:30:28,639 --> 03:30:32,079
I'm concerned about another like, like you're a suck-up German.

4172
03:30:32,159 --> 03:30:35,280
That you're just going to take over where he left off and not improve at all.

4173
03:30:35,280 --> 03:30:37,200
Okay, I understand that.

4174
03:30:37,200 --> 03:30:38,000
Thank you for that.

4175
03:30:38,000 --> 03:30:39,120
Like, you're really like...

4176
03:30:39,120 --> 03:30:40,000
Thank you for that.

4177
03:30:40,959 --> 03:30:41,280
Yeah.

4178
03:30:42,000 --> 03:30:42,719
Doctor?

4179
03:30:42,719 --> 03:30:43,280
Uh, sir.

4180
03:30:44,239 --> 03:30:47,360
Could you just turn around in a circle for a minute, please?

4181
03:30:50,889 --> 03:30:51,370
Thank you.

4182
03:30:52,010 --> 03:30:53,370
There was no reason for that.

4183
03:30:53,370 --> 03:30:54,090
Oh, okay, great.

4184
03:30:54,090 --> 03:30:55,850
Oh, he just wanted to...

4185
03:30:55,850 --> 03:30:58,010
But, uh, happy to see you.

4186
03:30:58,010 --> 03:30:59,610
Did you like what you saw?

4187
03:30:59,610 --> 03:31:02,090
The real German has a dinosaur dumping.

4188
03:31:02,889 --> 03:31:03,629
Sorry.

4189
03:31:04,670 --> 03:31:06,430
Honestly, you're an inspiring performer.

4190
03:31:07,229 --> 03:31:09,069
And I'm excited to see you in the final round.

4191
03:31:09,069 --> 03:31:09,389
Thank you so much.

4192
03:31:09,389 --> 03:31:10,030
Number nine.

4193
03:31:10,030 --> 03:31:10,750
Congratulations.

4194
03:31:10,750 --> 03:31:11,389
Thank you guys.

4195
03:31:11,389 --> 03:31:11,870
Thank you.

4196
03:31:11,870 --> 03:31:12,430
Thank you.

4197
03:31:12,430 --> 03:31:13,069
Good luck, sir.

4198
03:31:13,629 --> 03:31:14,590
You're in Chad's hands.

4199
03:31:15,229 --> 03:31:16,110
I think we're up there.

4200
03:31:17,309 --> 03:31:17,950
Number 10.

4201
03:31:18,989 --> 03:31:19,549
Come on out.

4202
03:31:22,409 --> 03:31:23,129
Oh, what was that?

4203
03:31:23,129 --> 03:31:23,610
Sorry.

4204
03:31:23,610 --> 03:31:24,090
Hot.

4205
03:31:24,090 --> 03:31:24,569
Mic is hot.

4206
03:31:25,209 --> 03:31:27,280
How's it going?

4207
03:31:27,280 --> 03:31:27,600
It's good.

4208
03:31:27,600 --> 03:31:28,239
How are you guys doing?

4209
03:31:28,239 --> 03:31:28,559
Finals.

4210
03:31:28,559 --> 03:31:29,840
Who would have thought?

4211
03:31:29,840 --> 03:31:30,399
Number 10.

4212
03:31:31,200 --> 03:31:33,200
You're the, you're the, you're the lying in your back fart guy.

4213
03:31:33,200 --> 03:31:33,520
That's right.

4214
03:31:33,520 --> 03:31:34,399
I am the back part man.

4215
03:31:35,200 --> 03:31:35,840
Yeah.

4216
03:31:35,840 --> 03:31:37,200
I think that's on Brandon.

4217
03:31:37,200 --> 03:31:38,159
Sorry for keeping you here.

4218
03:31:38,719 --> 03:31:40,399
Oh, uh, what?

4219
03:31:40,399 --> 03:31:41,040
It's okay.

4220
03:31:41,040 --> 03:31:42,959
A lot of people got to go home by now, so...

4221
03:31:42,959 --> 03:31:44,399
Well, you know, I'm chilling.

4222
03:31:44,399 --> 03:31:44,959
I'm doing great.

4223
03:31:45,760 --> 03:31:47,440
Well, you know, back farting was one thing.

4224
03:31:47,440 --> 03:31:49,520
I'm excited to see you do this copy pasta.

4225
03:31:49,520 --> 03:31:50,079
If you want to...

4226
03:31:50,719 --> 03:31:50,959
Yep.

4227
03:31:50,959 --> 03:31:51,360
Let's do it.

4228
03:31:53,079 --> 03:31:53,639
You get the floor.

4229
03:31:55,040 --> 03:31:56,799
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

4230
03:31:56,799 --> 03:32:01,120
Welcome to episode one of Germacraft.

4231
03:32:01,120 --> 03:32:03,120
The series where I played Minecraft.

4232
03:32:03,120 --> 03:32:04,959
This is going to be a single player.

4233
03:32:04,959 --> 03:32:05,920
Let's play.

4234
03:32:05,920 --> 03:32:11,920
And when I say let's play, I use that term pretty loosely because I am an idiot in this game.

4235
03:32:11,920 --> 03:32:15,850
You're going to see lots of fails, lots of triumphs.

4236
03:32:15,850 --> 03:32:16,889
At least I'm hoping.

4237
03:32:16,889 --> 03:32:20,780
So grab yourself a hot cup of cocoa, hot cup of coffee.

4238
03:32:21,340 --> 03:32:23,180
I have apple cider right here, freshly brewed.

4239
03:32:23,180 --> 03:32:24,379
Let me take a sip.

4240
03:32:24,379 --> 03:32:28,219
Ah, it's good cider.

4241
03:32:28,219 --> 03:32:29,100
He made sound effect.

4242
03:32:29,100 --> 03:32:29,500
I don't know.

4243
03:32:29,500 --> 03:32:30,299
He made a sound effect.

4244
03:32:30,299 --> 03:32:31,500
Sound effect.

4245
03:32:31,500 --> 03:32:32,379
I like the tea.

4246
03:32:32,379 --> 03:32:33,420
Very effective sound effect.

4247
03:32:33,420 --> 03:32:33,819
More like a...

4248
03:32:33,819 --> 03:32:34,620
It's even better.

4249
03:32:34,620 --> 03:32:36,139
We're going to know.

4250
03:32:36,139 --> 03:32:36,940
Okay, please mom.

4251
03:32:37,020 --> 03:32:42,139
Well, you know, to me, it was just more of like an NPR read, you know?

4252
03:32:42,139 --> 03:32:46,620
Like I'm listening to radio and they're about to introduce the next song more than a let's play.

4253
03:32:47,340 --> 03:32:48,459
Let's play, you know?

4254
03:32:51,180 --> 03:32:56,540
It's tough because you got the back farting, you got the look, you got the energy.

4255
03:32:58,030 --> 03:33:01,309
I just, I don't know if you got what it takes to be able to order

4256
03:33:01,309 --> 03:33:03,469
four sandwiches from McDonald's, eat it and shit your pants.

4257
03:33:05,069 --> 03:33:05,309
Really?

4258
03:33:05,309 --> 03:33:06,110
What makes you say that?

4259
03:33:06,510 --> 03:33:07,469
I just something about it.

4260
03:33:07,469 --> 03:33:08,190
I'm so sorry.

4261
03:33:10,190 --> 03:33:11,389
You missed Machito yesterday.

4262
03:33:11,389 --> 03:33:12,350
He was pretty fucking vicious.

4263
03:33:12,350 --> 03:33:14,110
What is your McDonald's order, if I could ask?

4264
03:33:14,110 --> 03:33:15,309
What's your McDonald's order?

4265
03:33:15,309 --> 03:33:15,549
Yeah.

4266
03:33:16,510 --> 03:33:19,229
That's four Big Macs and two Flurries.

4267
03:33:19,950 --> 03:33:20,510
That's it.

4268
03:33:20,510 --> 03:33:21,229
That's all I need.

4269
03:33:21,229 --> 03:33:21,950
That's not bad.

4270
03:33:21,950 --> 03:33:22,510
That's absurd.

4271
03:33:22,510 --> 03:33:23,229
That's not bad.

4272
03:33:23,229 --> 03:33:25,709
No, I think the fries are actually pretty overrated there.

4273
03:33:25,709 --> 03:33:26,270
No lie.

4274
03:33:26,270 --> 03:33:26,829
Yeah.

4275
03:33:26,829 --> 03:33:28,909
I have a question for Jerma.

4276
03:33:28,909 --> 03:33:29,309
Sure.

4277
03:33:29,309 --> 03:33:32,030
I think this needs to be cleared up and should have been cleared up earlier.

4278
03:33:32,030 --> 03:33:35,469
How many takes did you do on the original Minecraft episode one

4279
03:33:35,469 --> 03:33:37,709
before you were like, that's the one?

4280
03:33:37,709 --> 03:33:38,719
How many takes?

4281
03:33:38,719 --> 03:33:41,840
I can tell, like the way it's written, I can tell like you were,

4282
03:33:41,840 --> 03:33:42,879
it was bubbling, you know?

4283
03:33:42,879 --> 03:33:44,319
Like you didn't do it first take.

4284
03:33:44,319 --> 03:33:45,840
I mean, it was probably 10 takes.

4285
03:33:46,959 --> 03:33:50,159
Look, let me be real to the entire audience watching.

4286
03:33:50,879 --> 03:33:53,360
Every YouTuber that you've ever heard in your whole life,

4287
03:33:54,319 --> 03:34:01,360
they spend two fucking hours doing their intro and they hate it.

4288
03:34:01,360 --> 03:34:04,000
They hate every single take they do.

4289
03:34:04,000 --> 03:34:05,760
Hello, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to episode one.

4290
03:34:06,000 --> 03:34:07,520
Of JermaCraft.

4291
03:34:07,520 --> 03:34:09,360
They fucking retake it 10 times.

4292
03:34:11,120 --> 03:34:11,840
What?

4293
03:34:11,840 --> 03:34:13,680
And you hated his first take.

4294
03:34:14,559 --> 03:34:15,520
Let's get a second take.

4295
03:34:15,520 --> 03:34:16,000
Second take.

4296
03:34:17,100 --> 03:34:17,899
Two take, Tyler.

4297
03:34:18,700 --> 03:34:19,579
I appreciate the opportunity.

4298
03:34:19,579 --> 03:34:19,899
Thank you.

4299
03:34:21,500 --> 03:34:27,020
Hello, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to episode one of JermaCraft.

4300
03:34:27,020 --> 03:34:28,540
It's the same.

4301
03:34:28,540 --> 03:34:29,100
No, it's not.

4302
03:34:29,100 --> 03:34:29,579
Let him go.

4303
03:34:29,579 --> 03:34:30,379
Let him go.

4304
03:34:30,379 --> 03:34:31,819
Let's get one more from the top, please.

4305
03:34:31,819 --> 03:34:32,700
From the top.

4306
03:34:32,700 --> 03:34:33,979
And really think about it.

4307
03:34:33,979 --> 03:34:34,700
I pull it back.

4308
03:34:34,700 --> 03:34:35,899
And you're underwater.

4309
03:34:36,860 --> 03:34:37,899
It's a let's play.

4310
03:34:37,899 --> 03:34:38,700
You're having fun.

4311
03:34:38,700 --> 03:34:39,340
You're having fun.

4312
03:34:39,340 --> 03:34:40,139
Number 10, you're underwater.

4313
03:34:40,139 --> 03:34:40,780
You're underwater.

4314
03:34:40,780 --> 03:34:42,860
You're underwater and there's submarines everywhere.

4315
03:34:44,299 --> 03:34:47,819
Hello, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to episode one of JermaCraft.

4316
03:34:47,819 --> 03:34:49,100
How are you talking underwater?

4317
03:34:49,100 --> 03:34:49,819
How are you talking?

4318
03:34:49,819 --> 03:34:50,940
Shit, I didn't think that.

4319
03:34:50,940 --> 03:34:51,899
This is unrealistic.

4320
03:34:51,899 --> 03:34:54,459
I thought it was like Subnautica or something.

4321
03:34:54,459 --> 03:34:55,500
No, it's Minecraft.

4322
03:34:56,219 --> 03:34:57,100
You'd be drowning.

4323
03:34:57,659 --> 03:34:58,620
You wouldn't talk if you're...

4324
03:34:58,620 --> 03:35:02,139
You're giving him like unrealistic ways to like go about this.

4325
03:35:02,139 --> 03:35:03,280
This is like the fourth take.

4326
03:35:03,280 --> 03:35:04,159
This doesn't make sense.

4327
03:35:04,159 --> 03:35:06,159
If he's underwater, why would he talk so clearly?

4328
03:35:06,159 --> 03:35:07,920
Honestly, I think you have what it takes.

4329
03:35:07,920 --> 03:35:10,239
Unfortunately, these two knuckleheads...

4330
03:35:10,239 --> 03:35:11,200
Well, it's two-two, isn't it?

4331
03:35:13,200 --> 03:35:13,760
Yeah, these two.

4332
03:35:14,559 --> 03:35:15,680
Wait, what are you doing?

4333
03:35:15,680 --> 03:35:16,239
What are you...

4334
03:35:16,239 --> 03:35:17,040
Is that a no?

4335
03:35:17,680 --> 03:35:18,159
It's a no.

4336
03:35:19,360 --> 03:35:21,200
Number 10, I think you really have what it took.

4337
03:35:21,200 --> 03:35:21,840
Oh, thank you very much.

4338
03:35:26,399 --> 03:35:27,360
I thought you did too.

4339
03:35:27,360 --> 03:35:28,399
Give me notes for me, doctor.

4340
03:35:28,399 --> 03:35:28,719
Yeah.

4341
03:35:28,719 --> 03:35:29,920
Doctor, any notes?

4342
03:35:29,920 --> 03:35:33,280
Sir, I heard you wax poetic.

4343
03:35:34,159 --> 03:35:36,780
I heard you talk from the heart.

4344
03:35:37,420 --> 03:35:40,540
I heard intelligence of a new degree.

4345
03:35:40,540 --> 03:35:41,180
So no way.

4346
03:35:41,180 --> 03:35:43,659
Get your fucking hands off me.

4347
03:35:43,659 --> 03:35:44,299
That's fair.

4348
03:35:44,299 --> 03:35:45,020
Thank you.

4349
03:35:45,020 --> 03:35:46,059
I appreciate that, doctor.

4350
03:35:46,059 --> 03:35:50,159
Wait, number 10, you haven't cried yet.

4351
03:35:51,739 --> 03:35:58,540
You know, I came out here just a couple years ago to make a career at Twitch because I just love,

4352
03:35:58,540 --> 03:36:01,340
you know, I mean, you're such a young audience and they're really...

4353
03:36:02,139 --> 03:36:04,700
They'll give you tons of attention, you know, stroke the ego.

4354
03:36:04,700 --> 03:36:06,540
And I'm just looking for that.

4355
03:36:07,020 --> 03:36:07,819
That's how you win it now.

4356
03:36:07,819 --> 03:36:08,780
But you still are crying.

4357
03:36:10,459 --> 03:36:10,940
Cry though.

4358
03:36:11,659 --> 03:36:12,620
Yeah, I know.

4359
03:36:12,620 --> 03:36:13,659
It's fucking sad.

4360
03:36:14,379 --> 03:36:15,340
I feel your pain.

4361
03:36:16,860 --> 03:36:20,860
Cry and make sure you like put it on like the screen that he's crying so we get extra ratings

4362
03:36:20,860 --> 03:36:23,020
and stuff because people like when people cry on these shows.

4363
03:36:23,659 --> 03:36:24,379
Oh, God.

4364
03:36:25,260 --> 03:36:33,579
Hey, buddy, you have what it takes to be a shining star somewhere in your life.

4365
03:36:33,579 --> 03:36:35,260
Dr. Smoikson, please diagnose him.

4366
03:36:35,260 --> 03:36:36,459
Don't give up, sir.

4367
03:36:36,459 --> 03:36:38,620
WGBH is looking...

4368
03:36:40,700 --> 03:36:41,739
That's not even...

4369
03:36:41,739 --> 03:36:42,700
We're here.

4370
03:36:42,700 --> 03:36:43,579
That's Boston.

4371
03:36:45,340 --> 03:36:45,819
Thank you.

4372
03:36:45,819 --> 03:36:47,420
What are you trying?

4373
03:36:47,420 --> 03:36:48,059
Get out of here.

4374
03:36:48,700 --> 03:36:50,059
All right, I'm getting the fuck out of here.

4375
03:36:50,059 --> 03:36:51,100
Have a great night, Joe.

4376
03:36:51,100 --> 03:36:52,620
PBS is your...

4377
03:36:52,620 --> 03:36:53,420
PBS.

4378
03:36:53,420 --> 03:36:55,659
Can we please send out number 13 if you're still around?

4379
03:36:55,659 --> 03:36:56,700
Reset these buzzers.

4380
03:36:56,700 --> 03:36:57,979
Reset the buzzers if we could.

4381
03:37:00,250 --> 03:37:00,750
Hey.

4382
03:37:02,010 --> 03:37:02,969
So groovy, huh?

4383
03:37:02,969 --> 03:37:04,090
This is getting me in the mood.

4384
03:37:04,889 --> 03:37:05,930
Okay, 13.

4385
03:37:05,930 --> 03:37:07,129
I always thought you had a great smile.

4386
03:37:09,120 --> 03:37:09,680
Hi, 13.

4387
03:37:09,680 --> 03:37:10,479
How are you doing?

4388
03:37:10,479 --> 03:37:11,200
Well, how are you doing?

4389
03:37:12,079 --> 03:37:12,719
13.

4390
03:37:12,719 --> 03:37:14,399
You made it all the way to the end.

4391
03:37:15,120 --> 03:37:16,079
How do you feel?

4392
03:37:16,079 --> 03:37:17,040
Surprised.

4393
03:37:17,040 --> 03:37:17,760
Surprised?

4394
03:37:17,760 --> 03:37:19,040
But with the nunchucks and the nuts?

4395
03:37:19,040 --> 03:37:19,840
That was a great joke.

4396
03:37:19,840 --> 03:37:22,959
I didn't think it was gonna, you know, make the cut.

4397
03:37:23,520 --> 03:37:24,319
Don't think so.

4398
03:37:24,319 --> 03:37:26,159
No, no, but I'm pleasantly surprised.

4399
03:37:26,159 --> 03:37:29,360
It was a good pre-planned joke and I liked it a lot.

4400
03:37:29,360 --> 03:37:30,879
And sometimes you got to think fast on your feet.

4401
03:37:30,879 --> 03:37:32,159
Do the pog face.

4402
03:37:32,159 --> 03:37:32,659
Pog.

4403
03:37:33,360 --> 03:37:34,000
What's a pog?

4404
03:37:34,639 --> 03:37:36,959
No, no, no, he got it.

4405
03:37:36,959 --> 03:37:37,760
He's got it.

4406
03:37:37,760 --> 03:37:39,600
Don't even, are you serious?

4407
03:37:39,600 --> 03:37:40,079
Is that it?

4408
03:37:40,079 --> 03:37:41,040
That's a pog face.

4409
03:37:41,040 --> 03:37:42,399
He did it first try.

4410
03:37:42,399 --> 03:37:43,520
He's like, no, he's doing this.

4411
03:37:45,200 --> 03:37:46,319
That's literally it right there.

4412
03:37:46,319 --> 03:37:47,040
That's it.

4413
03:37:47,040 --> 03:37:47,520
That's it.

4414
03:37:47,520 --> 03:37:48,079
That's it.

4415
03:37:48,079 --> 03:37:48,799
Hold that.

4416
03:37:48,799 --> 03:37:49,299
Hold that.

4417
03:37:50,079 --> 03:37:51,600
You cannot buzz him.

4418
03:37:51,600 --> 03:37:52,959
He took him five seconds.

4419
03:37:52,959 --> 03:37:53,680
That was good.

4420
03:37:53,680 --> 03:37:54,159
That was good.

4421
03:37:54,159 --> 03:37:55,280
He took him five seconds to do it.

4422
03:37:56,459 --> 03:37:57,420
All right, number 13.

4423
03:37:57,420 --> 03:38:00,059
If you could do the Germacraft copy pasta.

4424
03:38:00,059 --> 03:38:00,780
I would love to hear.

4425
03:38:06,750 --> 03:38:07,250
Hello.

4426
03:38:07,870 --> 03:38:14,590
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the first episode of Germacraft, the series.

4427
03:38:15,309 --> 03:38:16,909
I play Minecraft.

4428
03:38:17,790 --> 03:38:21,069
Now, this is going to be a single player.

4429
03:38:21,069 --> 03:38:21,629
Let's play.

4430
03:38:22,430 --> 03:38:28,909
But when I use that term, let's play, I use that term loosely because I am an idiot in this game.

4431
03:38:29,870 --> 03:38:36,750
Now, you're going to see lots of triumphs, lots of fails, even more triumphs.

4432
03:38:37,149 --> 03:38:38,670
At least I'm hoping so.

4433
03:38:38,670 --> 03:38:42,430
So let's grab a nice hot cup of coffee.

4434
03:38:42,430 --> 03:38:44,030
Nice hot cup of cocoa.

4435
03:38:44,030 --> 03:38:46,909
I got a nice hot cup of cider right here.

4436
03:38:49,690 --> 03:38:51,690
It's invisible, but freshly brewed.

4437
03:38:53,579 --> 03:38:54,860
Oh, that's good cider.

4438
03:38:58,649 --> 03:39:02,170
I think coming in with a Christopher Walken is actually pretty brave.

4439
03:39:02,170 --> 03:39:03,770
He dropped it halfway through.

4440
03:39:03,770 --> 03:39:08,250
I mean, seriously, if you come in with a Walken, it's going to be good.

4441
03:39:08,809 --> 03:39:09,930
And that was a good Walken.

4442
03:39:10,170 --> 03:39:11,209
It sure was great.

4443
03:39:11,209 --> 03:39:12,329
Thank you, Germa.

4444
03:39:14,090 --> 03:39:20,329
If you do Germacraft copypasta with a Walken, wow, that's at least five or six extra points.

4445
03:39:20,329 --> 03:39:21,690
We're off to a good start.

4446
03:39:21,690 --> 03:39:22,569
Yes, we are.

4447
03:39:22,569 --> 03:39:26,809
Can you do like the cowbell routine, just to be sure?

4448
03:39:26,809 --> 03:39:29,049
I'm ready to know you.

4449
03:39:29,049 --> 03:39:30,250
Don't press the button.

4450
03:39:30,250 --> 03:39:31,290
I got a fever.

4451
03:39:31,850 --> 03:39:35,370
A new prescription is more Germa.

4452
03:39:35,370 --> 03:39:35,930
Okay, don't.

4453
03:39:35,930 --> 03:39:36,569
Got to have it.

4454
03:39:38,090 --> 03:39:38,969
He's got a Christopher Walken.

4455
03:39:38,969 --> 03:39:41,129
My pants on one leg at a time.

4456
03:39:41,129 --> 03:39:41,930
Nobody buzz this guy.

4457
03:39:41,930 --> 03:39:46,329
The only difference is after I've got my pants on, I replace Germa.

4458
03:39:46,969 --> 03:39:50,090
Okay, he's got an absolutely phenomenal Walken.

4459
03:39:50,090 --> 03:39:50,969
He's got a Walken.

4460
03:39:50,969 --> 03:39:52,090
That's better than my Trump.

4461
03:39:52,090 --> 03:39:53,370
That's better than my Bernie.

4462
03:39:53,370 --> 03:39:54,489
That's better than my Walken.

4463
03:39:54,489 --> 03:39:55,930
Is that J.R.R. Walken?

4464
03:39:55,930 --> 03:39:57,770
Oh, that's phenomenal.

4465
03:39:57,770 --> 03:39:59,129
Number 13, I don't.

4466
03:40:00,319 --> 03:40:00,819
Really?

4467
03:40:01,440 --> 03:40:02,639
He can't please everybody.

4468
03:40:03,360 --> 03:40:04,239
Can't please everyone.

4469
03:40:06,700 --> 03:40:07,819
He said himself.

4470
03:40:09,079 --> 03:40:10,040
Don't, no.

4471
03:40:10,040 --> 03:40:11,479
I'm kidding, I'm talking about.

4472
03:40:12,520 --> 03:40:13,319
I'm good, I'm happy.

4473
03:40:13,319 --> 03:40:14,440
I took it back, I took it back.

4474
03:40:14,440 --> 03:40:15,159
It was the moment.

4475
03:40:15,159 --> 03:40:17,719
Number 13, you've made it to the final three.

4476
03:40:19,239 --> 03:40:20,600
That is the final three we have.

4477
03:40:20,600 --> 03:40:21,719
That's a great celebration.

4478
03:40:22,280 --> 03:40:23,799
That's a good, I'm sorry, I take it back.

4479
03:40:23,799 --> 03:40:25,239
That's such a good celebration.

4480
03:40:25,799 --> 03:40:26,600
Jog in place.

4481
03:40:26,600 --> 03:40:27,239
Thank you very much.

4482
03:40:27,239 --> 03:40:28,520
We do have our final three, don't we?

4483
03:40:29,239 --> 03:40:31,000
I think we have our actual final three.

4484
03:40:31,879 --> 03:40:32,680
I love to hear that.

4485
03:40:33,479 --> 03:40:35,879
So we're going to take one final break.

4486
03:40:36,860 --> 03:40:37,739
And then guess what?

4487
03:40:38,989 --> 03:40:43,950
You decide on who replaces me on German 985.

4488
03:40:43,950 --> 03:40:46,030
Twitch.tv slash German 985.

4489
03:40:46,590 --> 03:40:48,190
We'll be right back in about two, three minutes.

4490
03:40:49,690 --> 03:40:50,729
For the real end.

4491
03:48:54,969 --> 03:48:55,690
Okay, we're back.

4492
03:48:56,799 --> 03:48:59,520
If you could please bring the three finalists out on stage,

4493
03:48:59,520 --> 03:49:00,239
please, if we could.

4494
03:49:01,399 --> 03:49:05,879
That would be one and nine and 13.

4495
03:49:06,600 --> 03:49:08,920
Hello, one, nine, and 13.

4496
03:49:08,920 --> 03:49:09,420
How are you?

4497
03:49:11,360 --> 03:49:14,559
You are the finalists for who will replace me,

4498
03:49:14,559 --> 03:49:16,319
German 985, on my Twitch channel.

4499
03:49:17,040 --> 03:49:18,079
How do you feel?

4500
03:49:18,079 --> 03:49:20,319
Very well, still shaking.

4501
03:49:20,319 --> 03:49:21,920
Good, good, shaking, shaking.

4502
03:49:22,639 --> 03:49:25,040
Well, unfortunately, the judges here now

4503
03:49:25,040 --> 03:49:28,159
no longer have a say because it's now your say.

4504
03:49:29,819 --> 03:49:31,260
They don't have a mic, but that's okay.

4505
03:49:32,450 --> 03:49:33,809
Everybody in the chat right now,

4506
03:49:33,809 --> 03:49:38,129
there will be a poll to decide of these three.

4507
03:49:39,180 --> 03:49:41,739
One, nine, and 13.

4508
03:49:42,770 --> 03:49:45,329
Who takes the German 985 moniker?

4509
03:49:45,969 --> 03:49:47,780
There will be a poll in chat.

4510
03:49:47,780 --> 03:49:49,379
It's for you to decide.

4511
03:49:50,260 --> 03:49:51,700
You get the final decision.

4512
03:49:52,579 --> 03:49:54,819
One, nine, or 13.

4513
03:49:55,540 --> 03:49:56,659
We look forward to the poll.

4514
03:49:56,659 --> 03:49:59,219
Maybe, maybe, maybe give some pizzazz at the end, you know?

4515
03:49:59,219 --> 03:50:01,379
Give a little, show them why you deserve it.

4516
03:50:02,350 --> 03:50:03,149
One, go ahead.

4517
03:50:03,149 --> 03:50:04,030
One, what do you got?

4518
03:50:05,579 --> 03:50:06,379
Right.

4519
03:50:06,379 --> 03:50:07,180
Nine, what do you got?

4520
03:50:09,219 --> 03:50:10,340
13, what are you doing?

4521
03:50:10,979 --> 03:50:11,940
Is it Batman?

4522
03:50:13,059 --> 03:50:13,940
Was that JoJo?

4523
03:50:14,819 --> 03:50:17,379
Oh, JoJo, I love JoJo.

4524
03:50:21,139 --> 03:50:23,219
We've got a very, this is ridiculous.

4525
03:50:23,219 --> 03:50:24,739
Okay, come on, what's the poll at right now?

4526
03:50:24,739 --> 03:50:26,340
It's between one percentage point, Jerm.

4527
03:50:26,340 --> 03:50:26,979
I'm looking at the stats right now.

4528
03:50:26,979 --> 03:50:28,180
It's one percentage point.

4529
03:50:28,739 --> 03:50:29,459
It's narrow.

4530
03:50:30,639 --> 03:50:32,159
One vote can take this.

4531
03:50:32,159 --> 03:50:34,479
One vote is deciding who wins.

4532
03:50:34,479 --> 03:50:35,920
Number nine, can you step forward one?

4533
03:50:36,899 --> 03:50:38,020
Move back now, thank you.

4534
03:50:38,579 --> 03:50:39,860
Number one, step forward two.

4535
03:50:40,659 --> 03:50:41,459
Step left three.

4536
03:50:42,579 --> 03:50:43,860
Step right three.

4537
03:50:43,860 --> 03:50:44,819
Cha cha, daddy-o.

4538
03:50:44,819 --> 03:50:45,620
Real smooth.

4539
03:50:45,620 --> 03:50:47,940
Step back and step back, okay?

4540
03:50:49,059 --> 03:50:50,260
What are we at right now for the poll?

4541
03:50:50,260 --> 03:50:50,739
Let's say it.

4542
03:50:53,010 --> 03:50:55,090
This is your Jerma985.

4543
03:50:55,889 --> 03:50:57,649
You are deciding right now.

4544
03:51:02,219 --> 03:51:04,379
One, nine, or 13.

4545
03:51:04,379 --> 03:51:06,620
Future one of the biggest channels on all of Twitch.

4546
03:51:07,180 --> 03:51:08,620
My goodness gracious.

4547
03:51:08,620 --> 03:51:09,659
I think it's going to double.

4548
03:51:10,459 --> 03:51:13,489
The projections are massive.

4549
03:51:13,489 --> 03:51:14,850
I don't know what to even do.

4550
03:51:14,850 --> 03:51:17,409
No matter what, all three of these guys

4551
03:51:17,409 --> 03:51:19,809
are a better pick for Jerma985 than Jerma985.

4552
03:51:19,809 --> 03:51:22,129
Absolutely, and I don't want you guys to forget us

4553
03:51:22,770 --> 03:51:24,209
when you ascend to godhood.

4554
03:51:24,209 --> 03:51:25,569
I would love to collab still

4555
03:51:25,569 --> 03:51:27,010
because I think I'll be even bigger.

4556
03:51:27,729 --> 03:51:30,639
You say totes collab?

4557
03:51:30,639 --> 03:51:31,120
That's great.

4558
03:51:31,680 --> 03:51:33,680
Ladies and gentlemen, we have the winner.

4559
03:51:33,680 --> 03:51:34,639
This is charming, totes.

4560
03:51:36,770 --> 03:51:40,100
The winner of the Who Will Replace Me

4561
03:51:40,819 --> 03:51:46,909
Jerma985 show is number one.

4562
03:51:46,909 --> 03:51:47,950
Step forward.

4563
03:51:47,950 --> 03:51:50,370
Now step back.

4564
03:51:52,270 --> 03:51:53,309
Number nine, step forward.

4565
03:51:55,440 --> 03:51:58,319
It's number 13.

4566
03:51:58,399 --> 03:51:59,920
Number 13 is the winner

4567
03:51:59,920 --> 03:52:02,399
for the Who Will Replace Me Jerma985.

4568
03:52:04,059 --> 03:52:04,620
Well earned.

4569
03:52:04,620 --> 03:52:08,860
Number 13 with 55% of the vote.

4570
03:52:08,860 --> 03:52:10,540
Unbelievable.

4571
03:52:10,540 --> 03:52:11,420
It was majority.

4572
03:52:12,059 --> 03:52:14,059
It was a majority.

4573
03:52:14,059 --> 03:52:16,379
New Jerma, new Jerma.

4574
03:52:16,379 --> 03:52:17,340
This is incredible.

4575
03:52:17,340 --> 03:52:17,979
Excellent.

4576
03:52:17,979 --> 03:52:19,180
A whole new era.

4577
03:52:19,180 --> 03:52:20,219
A whole new era.

4578
03:52:20,219 --> 03:52:21,100
I love this guy.

4579
03:52:22,620 --> 03:52:23,420
Wait a second.

4580
03:52:23,420 --> 03:52:23,979
Wait, what?

4581
03:52:25,020 --> 03:52:25,520
Wait a minute.

4582
03:52:26,639 --> 03:52:26,959
What?

4583
03:52:26,959 --> 03:52:27,680
Kill the music.

4584
03:52:29,090 --> 03:52:29,729
Number 13.

4585
03:52:30,850 --> 03:52:32,530
You think you have what it takes to be me?

4586
03:52:34,579 --> 03:52:35,219
You think you do?

4587
03:52:36,659 --> 03:52:38,020
Well, that's interesting

4588
03:52:38,020 --> 03:52:40,180
because if you think that you have what it takes to be me

4589
03:52:40,819 --> 03:52:42,659
then you need to have what it takes to beat me

4590
03:52:43,549 --> 03:52:45,069
because you're going against the master now.

4591
03:52:46,770 --> 03:52:49,409
You got to go against 1v1 me.

4592
03:52:50,770 --> 03:52:52,690
Everybody understands this.

4593
03:52:52,690 --> 03:52:55,569
I'm not going to let this channel go very, very loosely.

4594
03:52:55,569 --> 03:52:57,329
We had like a process.

4595
03:52:57,329 --> 03:52:58,530
Oh, there's a process.

4596
03:52:58,530 --> 03:53:00,770
The process is I got to see if you have what it really takes.

4597
03:53:02,989 --> 03:53:03,790
Ladies and gentlemen,

4598
03:53:04,430 --> 03:53:05,950
if you think you've got what it takes,

4599
03:53:06,510 --> 03:53:07,709
we will find out right now.

4600
03:53:10,370 --> 03:53:11,649
You think you can beat me?

4601
03:53:13,090 --> 03:53:14,739
You think you can beat me?

4602
03:53:14,739 --> 03:53:15,540
I know I can beat you.

4603
03:53:15,540 --> 03:53:16,899
I don't know what I'm going to beat you at.

4604
03:53:16,899 --> 03:53:17,940
You know you can beat me.

4605
03:53:17,940 --> 03:53:18,899
Go ahead and cue the music.

4606
03:53:19,620 --> 03:53:20,500
Good luck.

4607
03:53:21,139 --> 03:53:22,340
Weird monopoly, man.

4608
03:53:23,219 --> 03:53:26,020
Like a Swedish monopoly, man.

4609
03:53:32,030 --> 03:53:32,909
What is planned?

4610
03:53:32,909 --> 03:53:33,950
You guys secretized this?

4611
03:53:34,989 --> 03:53:38,959
Are you doing it so well?

4612
03:53:39,280 --> 03:53:40,959
Nobody beats me at my own game.

4613
03:53:40,959 --> 03:53:41,840
This is incredible.

4614
03:53:44,260 --> 03:53:45,459
These moves.

4615
03:53:45,459 --> 03:53:46,899
Whoa, whoa.

4616
03:53:46,899 --> 03:53:47,700
New Jerma.

4617
03:53:53,700 --> 03:53:55,219
He had moves the whole time.

4618
03:53:57,219 --> 03:53:57,780
One handed.

4619
03:54:04,180 --> 03:54:04,899
Something's happening.

4620
03:54:04,899 --> 03:54:05,700
Can you do this though?

4621
03:54:05,700 --> 03:54:06,340
Number 13.

4622
03:54:06,979 --> 03:54:07,700
There's no window.

4623
03:54:07,700 --> 03:54:08,579
Sure, there's no window.

4624
03:54:09,219 --> 03:54:09,719
Oh.

4625
03:54:12,610 --> 03:54:13,409
Perfectly executed.

4626
03:54:15,010 --> 03:54:15,809
I don't think so.

4627
03:54:19,569 --> 03:54:21,200
What's the vote say?

4628
03:54:24,290 --> 03:54:25,329
Chatters, you decide.

4629
03:54:26,049 --> 03:54:27,489
New Jerma or old Jerma?

4630
03:54:27,489 --> 03:54:28,370
Which one you pick it?

4631
03:54:32,670 --> 03:54:33,790
The old Jerma?

4632
03:54:33,790 --> 03:54:34,290
Yeah.

4633
03:54:39,420 --> 03:54:40,219
All right.

4634
03:54:40,219 --> 03:54:40,719
I win.

4635
03:54:42,190 --> 03:54:43,549
Nobody replaces me.

4636
03:54:43,549 --> 03:54:44,049
Nobody.

4637
03:54:44,930 --> 03:54:46,209
I'll be here forever.

4638
03:54:46,209 --> 03:54:47,409
This hardly seems fair.

4639
03:54:48,850 --> 03:54:50,129
No, that's not how it works.

4640
03:54:50,129 --> 03:54:51,090
What do you mean it's not how it works?

4641
03:54:51,090 --> 03:54:52,129
No, just get the fuck out of here.

4642
03:54:52,129 --> 03:54:52,629
Fuck off.

4643
03:54:52,629 --> 03:54:53,329
Cheater.

4644
03:54:53,329 --> 03:54:53,829
Fuck off.

4645
03:54:55,000 --> 03:54:56,040
No, fuck off.

4646
03:54:56,040 --> 03:54:56,540
You lose.

4647
03:54:58,309 --> 03:54:59,110
Sweet, what was that?

4648
03:54:59,110 --> 03:54:59,590
Six hours.

4649
03:54:59,590 --> 03:55:00,149
Get the fuck out.

4650
03:55:00,149 --> 03:55:00,870
Just go fucking back.

4651
03:55:00,870 --> 03:55:03,030
Why are we all here if you were just going to walk on stage?

4652
03:55:03,030 --> 03:55:03,670
Just go.

4653
03:55:03,670 --> 03:55:04,170
Fuck off.

4654
03:55:05,590 --> 03:55:06,469
No, it's you.

4655
03:55:06,469 --> 03:55:08,149
You decided you come to the show

4656
03:55:08,149 --> 03:55:09,829
and you beat me for a little while and I win.

4657
03:55:09,829 --> 03:55:11,510
No, no, it's called being a sore loser.

4658
03:55:12,069 --> 03:55:12,629
No, it's not.

4659
03:55:12,629 --> 03:55:13,670
This needs to be fixed.

4660
03:55:14,549 --> 03:55:15,270
Judges, really?

4661
03:55:15,270 --> 03:55:15,770
Judges?

4662
03:55:16,709 --> 03:55:17,190
What can we do?

4663
03:55:17,190 --> 03:55:18,709
What power do we have, Woodward?

4664
03:55:18,709 --> 03:55:19,270
You don't have power.

4665
03:55:19,270 --> 03:55:19,909
Get the fuck off.

4666
03:55:19,909 --> 03:55:21,590
I spent weeks rehearsing for this.

4667
03:55:21,590 --> 03:55:22,309
Yeah, what the fuck?

4668
03:55:22,309 --> 03:55:22,549
I don't care.

4669
03:55:22,549 --> 03:55:23,030
Weeks?

4670
03:55:23,030 --> 03:55:24,629
It's my life, you whole thing.

4671
03:55:24,629 --> 03:55:25,190
Your life?

4672
03:55:26,469 --> 03:55:26,969
Listen.

4673
03:55:27,750 --> 03:55:28,850
What, do you want to fucking go?

4674
03:55:28,850 --> 03:55:29,809
Are you going to fight?

4675
03:55:29,809 --> 03:55:30,850
What, you think it's fucking funny?

4676
03:55:30,850 --> 03:55:31,889
Is he ready to throw?

4677
03:55:31,889 --> 03:55:33,969
He thinks, oh yeah, you can take me too.

4678
03:55:33,969 --> 03:55:35,090
Oh, you think you can take me, yeah.

4679
03:55:35,090 --> 03:55:35,489
Have fun.

4680
03:55:35,489 --> 03:55:36,610
Yeah, let's get this shit off.

4681
03:55:36,610 --> 03:55:37,569
Fuck off, idiot.

4682
03:55:37,569 --> 03:55:38,209
No, this is good.

4683
03:55:38,209 --> 03:55:39,090
This is good TV.

4684
03:55:39,090 --> 03:55:40,610
If it works for Jake Paul, it'll work for us.

4685
03:55:41,170 --> 03:55:45,489
Oh, I'm actually pissed up because this guy thinks he's fucking got what it takes.

4686
03:55:45,489 --> 03:55:46,770
Okay, you want to fucking go?

4687
03:55:46,770 --> 03:55:48,370
Okay, let's go, let's go.

4688
03:55:48,370 --> 03:55:49,489
Shit, give me that fucking number.

4689
03:55:50,450 --> 03:55:51,010
What is this?

4690
03:55:56,930 --> 03:55:58,290
I don't think we can show this.

4691
03:55:58,290 --> 03:56:00,209
This is so much.

4692
03:56:00,209 --> 03:56:00,690
Take the kids.

4693
03:56:00,690 --> 03:56:02,610
This is still a week when pants are too...

4694
03:56:04,450 --> 03:56:05,090
Wait a minute.

4695
03:56:05,090 --> 03:56:06,450
Why is he undressing?

4696
03:56:06,450 --> 03:56:09,170
He's like, what's going on?

4697
03:56:09,250 --> 03:56:10,690
These pants are too fucking tight.

4698
03:56:12,290 --> 03:56:13,010
Okay.

4699
03:56:13,010 --> 03:56:13,969
All right, get involved.

4700
03:56:13,969 --> 03:56:15,729
Let's go 13, I'm rooting for you, baby.

4701
03:56:15,729 --> 03:56:16,530
Shut up, Ludwig.

4702
03:56:16,530 --> 03:56:17,250
Oh.

4703
03:56:17,250 --> 03:56:18,530
As soon as you get those pants off.

4704
03:56:21,409 --> 03:56:23,409
13, baby, this is your show.

4705
03:56:23,409 --> 03:56:24,530
Yeah, yeah, fuck you, man.

4706
03:56:24,530 --> 03:56:24,850
Come on.

4707
03:56:25,569 --> 03:56:26,370
New Jerma.

4708
03:56:26,370 --> 03:56:27,170
Guys.

4709
03:56:27,170 --> 03:56:28,690
Wait, I'm getting confused.

4710
03:56:28,690 --> 03:56:29,809
No one's going to replace me.

4711
03:56:29,809 --> 03:56:30,049
Never.

4712
03:56:30,049 --> 03:56:30,770
What's going on?

4713
03:56:30,770 --> 03:56:31,409
Never replace me.

4714
03:56:32,530 --> 03:56:33,250
Wait a second.

4715
03:56:33,250 --> 03:56:34,770
Wait, all right, break it up.

4716
03:56:34,770 --> 03:56:35,809
Real Jerma, come forward.

4717
03:56:35,809 --> 03:56:36,770
Real Jerma, come forward.

4718
03:56:37,889 --> 03:56:38,850
Which one's which?

4719
03:56:38,850 --> 03:56:39,729
Real Jerma, come here.

4720
03:56:40,290 --> 03:56:40,690
What?

4721
03:56:40,690 --> 03:56:41,809
Who wants to sit beside him?

4722
03:56:41,809 --> 03:56:43,090
Hey, there you go.

4723
03:56:43,090 --> 03:56:43,969
That's real Jerma.

4724
03:56:43,969 --> 03:56:44,690
No, no, wait a minute.

4725
03:56:44,690 --> 03:56:45,489
Let's cut this shit.

4726
03:56:45,489 --> 03:56:45,969
He's impossible.

4727
03:56:45,969 --> 03:56:47,809
13, can you stop for a moment?

4728
03:56:47,809 --> 03:56:48,610
He's not fucking 13.

4729
03:56:48,610 --> 03:56:49,170
I'm not Jerma.

4730
03:56:49,170 --> 03:56:50,850
13, can you stop for a moment?

4731
03:56:50,850 --> 03:56:52,739
I'm not retiring.

4732
03:56:52,739 --> 03:56:53,459
He's got to be.

4733
03:56:53,459 --> 03:56:55,379
I'm Jeremy.

4734
03:56:55,379 --> 03:56:55,700
What are you talking about?

4735
03:56:55,700 --> 03:56:56,180
No.

4736
03:56:56,180 --> 03:56:57,299
Don't listen.

4737
03:56:57,299 --> 03:56:57,620
No.

4738
03:56:57,620 --> 03:56:58,100
Come on, guys.

4739
03:56:58,100 --> 03:56:58,819
Can you say something?

4740
03:56:58,819 --> 03:57:00,100
This is the actor, I...

4741
03:57:00,100 --> 03:57:01,059
It's not a real deal.

4742
03:57:01,059 --> 03:57:03,379
Okay, do the thing, do the thing.

4743
03:57:03,379 --> 03:57:04,020
Like, prove it.

4744
03:57:04,020 --> 03:57:04,579
I think I do all the things.

4745
03:57:04,579 --> 03:57:05,540
Do the thing you do, Jerma.

4746
03:57:05,620 --> 03:57:06,180
Do the thing you do.

4747
03:57:10,020 --> 03:57:11,700
I've known you, Dr. Schmoox,

4748
03:57:11,700 --> 03:57:12,899
and I've known you for a long time.

4749
03:57:12,899 --> 03:57:15,139
Yes, it's him.

4750
03:57:15,139 --> 03:57:15,459
What?

4751
03:57:16,340 --> 03:57:16,739
Absolutely.

4752
03:57:16,739 --> 03:57:19,299
No, this guy, you can still see the...

4753
03:57:22,420 --> 03:57:23,780
Peter, six fucking hours.

4754
03:57:23,780 --> 03:57:25,219
We're going to pick this right now.

4755
03:57:25,219 --> 03:57:25,540
Okay?

4756
03:57:26,020 --> 03:57:26,979
No, it's me.

4757
03:57:26,979 --> 03:57:27,379
It's me.

4758
03:57:27,379 --> 03:57:28,340
It's not this idiot.

4759
03:57:28,340 --> 03:57:29,299
Well, we're going to figure out...

4760
03:57:29,299 --> 03:57:30,500
We hired this guy.

4761
03:57:30,500 --> 03:57:31,620
We're going to figure out who it is.

4762
03:57:32,180 --> 03:57:32,340
Okay?

4763
03:57:32,340 --> 03:57:32,979
All right.

4764
03:57:33,940 --> 03:57:35,459
Don't think we need violence.

4765
03:57:35,459 --> 03:57:36,340
That's stupid.

4766
03:57:36,340 --> 03:57:39,989
There is no reason for violence in this place.

4767
03:57:39,989 --> 03:57:40,790
Go out of the way, please.

4768
03:57:41,510 --> 03:57:41,909
All right.

4769
03:57:43,190 --> 03:57:45,190
Please, please, Dr. Schmoox, you know.

4770
03:57:46,950 --> 03:57:49,750
I've known Jerma for 12 years.

4771
03:57:49,750 --> 03:57:51,510
I've known him my whole life.

4772
03:57:51,510 --> 03:57:52,950
I know the real Jerma.

4773
03:57:52,950 --> 03:57:55,030
Stir, stir.

4774
03:57:55,030 --> 03:57:57,270
It's obvious which one's the real one.

4775
03:57:57,270 --> 03:57:58,629
Be cautious with the gun.

4776
03:57:58,629 --> 03:57:59,510
Be cautious with the gun.

4777
03:57:59,510 --> 03:58:00,229
Guys, guys.

4778
03:58:00,229 --> 03:58:00,629
Guns hurt.

4779
03:58:00,629 --> 03:58:01,270
Look at me.

4780
03:58:01,270 --> 03:58:01,750
You know?

4781
03:58:01,750 --> 03:58:02,389
Look at me.

4782
03:58:02,389 --> 03:58:02,950
Guns hurt.

4783
03:58:02,950 --> 03:58:04,389
Stir, I've known him for 10 years.

4784
03:58:04,389 --> 03:58:05,030
We've...

4785
03:58:05,030 --> 03:58:06,149
TF2 and...

4786
03:58:06,149 --> 03:58:06,629
Look at me.

4787
03:58:07,430 --> 03:58:07,989
Look at me.

4788
03:58:07,989 --> 03:58:08,549
That's me.

4789
03:58:08,549 --> 03:58:09,909
Jerma, I just want you to know.

4790
03:58:09,909 --> 03:58:10,950
You can Google all that.

4791
03:58:10,950 --> 03:58:11,670
He knows nothing.

4792
03:58:11,670 --> 03:58:13,670
I could tell who it was the whole time.

4793
03:58:13,670 --> 03:58:13,829
What?

4794
03:58:17,329 --> 03:58:18,340
You shot...

4795
03:58:19,540 --> 03:58:20,260
You shot him.

4796
03:58:25,120 --> 03:58:27,840
You...

4797
03:58:27,840 --> 03:58:28,319
Fuck.

4798
03:58:28,319 --> 03:58:30,680
I'm going to haunt you for the rest of my life.

4799
03:58:31,399 --> 03:58:32,680
Don't listen to this fraud.

4800
03:58:33,799 --> 03:58:35,239
Somebody call an ambulance.

4801
03:58:35,239 --> 03:58:36,280
No, we don't need it.

4802
03:58:36,280 --> 03:58:37,239
No, you're a doctor.

4803
03:58:37,239 --> 03:58:38,200
Just go help us.

4804
03:58:38,200 --> 03:58:39,239
Hey, it's all right.

4805
03:58:39,239 --> 03:58:40,600
We shot the fake Jerma.

4806
03:58:40,600 --> 03:58:41,399
Real Jerma, you...

4807
03:58:41,399 --> 03:58:41,959
We can't...

4808
03:58:41,959 --> 03:58:42,840
You're back, baby.

4809
03:58:42,840 --> 03:58:43,479
We can't...

4810
03:58:43,479 --> 03:58:45,239
I'm sorry he tried to mess with you.

4811
03:58:45,239 --> 03:58:46,440
I'm sorry he tried to mess with you.

4812
03:58:47,559 --> 03:58:48,360
I don't know.

4813
03:58:48,360 --> 03:58:48,840
He did a...

4814
03:58:50,600 --> 03:58:51,639
Okay, Jerma.

4815
03:58:51,639 --> 03:58:53,319
You can't do this.

4816
03:58:55,139 --> 03:58:55,620
Well, guys...

4817
03:58:56,819 --> 03:58:57,620
New Jerma.

4818
03:58:57,620 --> 03:58:58,340
Real Jerma.

4819
03:58:58,340 --> 03:58:59,299
Real Jerma.

4820
03:58:59,299 --> 03:59:00,180
Real Jerma.

4821
03:59:00,979 --> 03:59:01,379
Dead Jerma.

4822
03:59:01,379 --> 03:59:02,739
Let's get this imposter out of here.

4823
03:59:02,739 --> 03:59:03,379
Dead Jerma.

4824
03:59:03,379 --> 03:59:04,100
Dead Jerma.

4825
03:59:06,770 --> 03:59:08,049
Oh my god.

4826
03:59:08,049 --> 03:59:08,530
Do the thing.

4827
03:59:10,049 --> 03:59:11,049
Yeah.

4828
03:59:12,069 --> 03:59:12,569
Yeah.

4829
03:59:13,510 --> 03:59:14,549
That's my Jerma.

4830
03:59:15,270 --> 03:59:16,469
That's my Jerma.

4831
03:59:16,469 --> 03:59:17,270
I guess so.

4832
03:59:17,270 --> 03:59:18,389
9.85.

4833
03:59:18,389 --> 03:59:20,149
All right, 9.85.

4834
03:59:20,149 --> 03:59:21,270
A hot cup of shite on you.

4835
03:59:22,149 --> 03:59:22,649
Yeah.

4836
03:59:23,350 --> 03:59:23,850
Yeah.

4837
03:59:24,229 --> 03:59:25,270
This guy.

4838
03:59:25,270 --> 03:59:25,770
Hit it.

4839
03:59:26,790 --> 03:59:30,120
We're looking forward to playing lots of Minecraft.

4840
03:59:31,239 --> 03:59:32,040
Epic fails.

4841
03:59:33,079 --> 03:59:34,280
Even more epic crimes.

4842
03:59:35,969 --> 03:59:36,690
What can I say?

4843
03:59:36,690 --> 03:59:37,649
What can I say?

4844
03:59:37,649 --> 03:59:38,850
Epic fails and fun.

4845
03:59:39,729 --> 03:59:40,690
German bag, baby.

4846
03:59:41,649 --> 03:59:43,940
I'm glad we got that imposter, though.

4847
03:59:43,940 --> 03:59:45,219
That was scary.

4848
03:59:45,219 --> 03:59:48,020
I think we're clear.
