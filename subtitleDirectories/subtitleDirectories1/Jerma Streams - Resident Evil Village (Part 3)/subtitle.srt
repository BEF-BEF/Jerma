1
00:00:02,549 --> 00:00:15,699
How are you? What's up? What's up? Hey, somebody said, why is he doing the DLC?

2
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:23,300
Yeah, I played the main game, the base game. I played it pretty much on launch.

3
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:31,620
Resident Evil Village DLC. That's what is on tap tonight.

4
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:44,920
Play Roblox. No, all of you people that are saying play Roblox.

5
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,119
You want to play Roblox. So when I go into a server,

6
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:55,740
6,000 of you will join that server and like throw rocks at me. No, I'm not going to play it.

7
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,079
You guys are all collectively going to go into the Roblox server I go into

8
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:19,579
and body block push me off of a cliff. And maybe I'll do it one day. I don't know. No,

9
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:24,459
not right now. It's Halloween. I'm going to play Roblox on Halloween. It's Halloween in a few days.

10
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:31,019
We're doing Resident Evil Village DLC. I've heard this is only a few hours.

11
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:36,019
We'll see how it goes. Another couple of hours. We'll see. And if I get to the end of this and

12
00:01:36,019 --> 00:01:43,579
it's, you know, well, you say it's like three to four hours, but you're not accounting for the

13
00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:48,620
amount of time that I'm going to stop and tell you in like a 15 minute conversation about the

14
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:55,959
my favorite Tabasco flavor, right? It's probably going to be a little longer than that. Which,

15
00:01:55,959 --> 00:02:02,140
by the way, original red is fantastic. But I think a lot of people are sleeping on the green.

16
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:09,030
It's a little thicker. It's a little more like pickled, almost like jalapeno flavor.

17
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:13,430
The green is great. I think a lot of people are sleeping on it.

18
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:24,599
I'm not a big fan of the Chipotle one. No original green. Green looks like baby food.

19
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:32,740
Doesn't taste like baby food. Will you ever do chat picks a Diablo two skill tree again?

20
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:40,009
I don't own hardcore, right? That's what it was. What a weird group of streams that was.

21
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:54,780
I played hardcore Diablo two. That was weird. No, no, maybe they were fun. They were fun.

22
00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:03,960
Let's go over a few things. So first of all, today we're streaming here for the, you know,

23
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:10,520
until we're done tomorrow. We're going to be streaming at 2pm. I'm trying to pull the streams

24
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:15,719
back because the internet problem has not been fixed. I did get in touch with the ISP and somebody

25
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:18,840
is going to, the technician is going to look into it. It's going to be whatever.

26
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:26,460
But at like 8pm Pacific, we might run into like an internet wormhole. So we're going to,

27
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:31,300
we're going to have to ride it out. If that happens, I'm trying to pull the streams back.

28
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:36,819
And yeah, I pulled it back 30 minutes today, but I really want to get started at like 1 to 2pm

29
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:45,830
permanently until that issue is solved. So we'll see. Cross your fingers. It doesn't happen,

30
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:53,300
but somebody is looking into it permanently. Internet wormhole. I don't know. Like we just

31
00:03:53,300 --> 00:04:00,949
run into some weird route at like 8pm that makes my internet shit. Sometimes it's on my end.

32
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:07,590
Sometimes it's not. It's very strange. I don't know. Guys, there's just like wires and boxes

33
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:19,160
that are connecting all of us. I don't know. It's a bunch of wires and like electrical boxes.

34
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:28,089
It's pretty much magic. It pretty much is. If anybody were to ever come and conquer Earth,

35
00:04:28,649 --> 00:04:32,459
I'm telling you, they're going to see all this shit underground. They're going to come here

36
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:36,420
for the gold. They're going to come here for the gold, but they're not going to understand

37
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:40,259
what the internet is. And they're going to see all these wires in the ground and be like, yeah,

38
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:44,180
dig all that up. That's not the gold, but that's what they really should have been looking for.

39
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:50,250
It's the infrastructure. It's the internet, right? Our communication ability.

40
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:57,430
And they're just going to go for the gold. Why would they want it? Does nobody get this?

41
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:01,910
Nobody gets this. Oh, the movie came out like 10 years ago. Nobody cares.

42
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:17,939
Nobody understands this, what I'm saying. Really? What? I don't want to say the movie

43
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:20,899
because I feel like people are going to be like, what the fuck, dude? I've never seen that movie.

44
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:28,389
People know what movie I'm talking about, right? Bro, chill. I'm fucking chill. What?

45
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:35,029
Don't tell me to chill. Who are you? Who is that person? I'm perfectly chilled out right now.

46
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:44,170
Dude, I was fine until you said that. If you haven't seen this movie in 10 years,

47
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:47,209
all right, then you're probably not going to see it. Or you'll probably, you've ever,

48
00:05:47,209 --> 00:05:50,889
it's Avatar. You've all seen Avatar. Who has not seen Avatar in this chat?

49
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:55,449
There has to be nobody here. And they're coming out with like 10 more of them. So whatever.

50
00:05:56,009 --> 00:06:04,860
You chill. You need to chill out. I'm chilling out right now. I, yeah,

51
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:17,129
spoiler alert for the movie Avatar that came out in like 2012. He's aging. Yeah, I am.

52
00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:33,579
And I'm fine with it. What is it? Avatar is a movie that is about plugging in

53
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:40,230
and like being in another person's body. It's been a long time. I haven't seen it in a long time.

54
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:44,230
All I know is that there's like metal in the earth or in their earth. Whatever. I don't,

55
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:53,269
oh wait, I'm done. What is it called? Unobtanium. The movie was fine. That was,

56
00:06:53,269 --> 00:07:00,250
I thought it was entertaining. It was fine. I thought it was cool. Dude, relax. All right.

57
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:04,660
You can't tell me to relax when I'm about to play like a horror game. And in Resident Evil

58
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:12,980
Village is it a horror game? It kind of is. Anyways, welcome everybody. We're going to turn

59
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:18,420
on Resident Evil Village's DLC. This is where you play as Rose. It literally came out today.

60
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:26,120
I also have another thing to talk about, but I'm going to wait. I'm going to wait

61
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,879
until there are enough people here. I don't want to say it until enough people are here.

62
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:40,730
Wait. Once we have all of you are here, we'll tell you something. It's very good DLC. That's

63
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:54,149
good to know. NK is not enough. My thing doesn't say 10K. My thing doesn't say that. Has it not

64
00:07:54,149 --> 00:08:08,490
updated? Well, just wait. Wait like 10 minutes. Do we need to take a roll call? Okay. Roll call.

65
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:25,829
Who's here? Are you here? Say, present. You guys ready for the village? We're going to have to

66
00:08:25,829 --> 00:08:31,000
adjust the audio, I think. All right. So is it good? I'll put two headphones in. All right.

67
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,320
Shadows of Rose. I got to remember how to play this game. I don't remember how to play.

68
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:38,840
This is new content. This came out literally today. Apparently it's pretty good.

69
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:53,590
It's a short campaign. Looking forward to it. Are you ready? Here it comes. You look like you're

70
00:08:53,590 --> 00:09:23,740
from LA Noir. What do you think? Dude, you're going to play it all up. Hey, K. Sorry I'm late.

71
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:29,110
It's okay. I'm just enjoying the day. You said you had something important to tell me.

72
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:33,509
I hope it's not about Chris wanting me to join his operation because

73
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:38,620
I already told him that's not happening. I see what he puts you and the rest of his

74
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:45,720
hound wolf squad through. No thank you. It's not about that. It is about you.

75
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:55,450
Play the new Call of Duty or else. Stop talking during the movie. How are things at school?

76
00:09:56,649 --> 00:10:00,649
Seriously? That's what you wanted to talk to me about? That group of mean girls still

77
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:08,419
hassling you? You mean are they still treating me like a freak? Hey, uh-uh. Look at me.

78
00:10:08,419 --> 00:10:18,519
You are not a freak. I am. No I am. That's why I keep my distance from everybody at school.

79
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:30,039
They knew what I really was. So you don't have any friends that you can talk to? Who is this?

80
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:36,759
Talk to? About what? How I'm hardly even human? How I'm some kind of horrendous monster?

81
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:46,259
Hey, it's okay. I hardly ever murder my friends. What if there were a way to get rid of your powers?

82
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:57,720
And get rid of them in a heartbeat. Get rid of them? All right. Well, I think there's something I need

83
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:05,720
to show you. Get rid of your powers? We already know about Miranda and the mutimized heat. How

84
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:11,639
she researched it obsessively and performed experiments on human subjects. Like me? Exactly.

85
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,159
Uh, what you don't know is that we recently found some of her research.

86
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:22,600
Apparently she discovered a purifying crystal that can remove the mutimized heat from a toast.

87
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,720
Purifying crystal? If we can get our hands on one of these we might be able to weaken or

88
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:35,639
remove your powers entirely. Are you kidding me? No, no, but her notes are incomplete. However,

89
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:39,960
I wouldn't want to get rid of all of them. I think I have an idea where we can find the rest of her

90
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:50,889
research. Let's do it. Let's find it. Where is it? In there. What? You just have to, uh, you just

91
00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:56,490
have to drink that. Stores memories from people who pass away in close proximity, including Miranda

92
00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:02,330
and everything she knows. Be careful, it smells like puke. You might be able to solve the mystery

93
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:05,690
of the purifying crystal. Wait, what do you mean enter its consciousness?

94
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:17,539
Yes. Okay, so you, your deep connection will allow you to explore the information within.

95
00:12:21,049 --> 00:12:27,690
That sounds crazy. You sound crazy. Yes, yes, yes, Rose, but not dangerous.

96
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:32,409
Right? Think of it just like walking through somebody else's memories.

97
00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:36,490
You really think this can work? I think it's worth trying.

98
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:45,750
What do you have to lose? It's just going to be like, how do I even do this in red Kool-Aid like

99
00:12:45,750 --> 00:13:01,899
molasses? I don't know. Try reaching out to it. It's Halloween, Rose. Okay. Fine. What the hell?

100
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:24,500
It's reacting. Rose is so weird. Yeah, it's like she sees things that aren't there.

101
00:13:25,299 --> 00:13:34,500
Creepy. What? Imagine wanting to be friends with her. Why would you not want to be friends

102
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:55,799
with a person that has fucking superpowers? Are you out of your mind? She's weird. Okay. She has

103
00:13:56,679 --> 00:14:09,610
like Avengers level superpowers. Don't. I'm still here. Okay. Okay. Where are you?

104
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:22,919
If Captain America walked in the room, would they go, oh, he's weird. What's her superpower?

105
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:33,529
Super strength? She could have bugs come out of her hands or something. I don't know. With something.

106
00:14:33,529 --> 00:14:42,100
What is it? It's mold. She has like powerful mold bugs. She has powerful mold that can

107
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:51,610
she could do like a venom arm like that can come out. Okay. Well, anyways, hi, I'm back. So let's

108
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:58,179
play. Miranda's research claims that the mega my seat preserves the memories of people who

109
00:14:58,179 --> 00:15:03,639
passed away within its area of influence, absorbing them into its own vast consciousness. We also know

110
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:08,360
based on our previous encounters with the mold that people who are contaminated with the meta

111
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:16,779
what is that word spelled out phonetically for me? Meta my seat. I was gonna say meta mucil.

112
00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:25,740
How is it? Whatever. All right. So you get on this mold network. So there's a mold network. If we

113
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:30,460
extrapolate from this, we can summarize that subjects with a strong affinity to the meta my

114
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:35,500
seat should be able to use the network to connect to the memories of the dead within the mega

115
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:41,379
my seat. It should be possible to verify this theory using the lab's mega my seat sample we

116
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:46,539
collected 16 years ago. We just need a suitable subject with a proven connection to the mold.

117
00:15:46,539 --> 00:15:51,509
It's a network. Unfortunately, this presents a problem. Our organization's policies prevent us

118
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:58,059
from directly contacting civilians who are infected with muta my seat. Certainly, the ethical reasoning

119
00:15:58,059 --> 00:16:02,779
is understandable, but it has rendered the confirmation of this theory impossible. It pains

120
00:16:02,779 --> 00:16:06,700
me to think of how much mankind could stand to benefit from this preservation and indexing of

121
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:12,009
human consciousness, the possibilities of preserving or even reclaiming great minds. Perhaps there's

122
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:23,720
some way of cutting through the red tape. Okay. Why is this in third person game? Why is it in third

123
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:36,539
person? Did I pick third person? It's they just added it. Yeah, but is this is the DLC third person?

124
00:16:37,019 --> 00:17:05,220
Wait. Yes. Wait. What? Explore. Wait, what's in here? I can't. I don't think I can do it. It's too scary.

125
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:19,660
Okay, this is so imagine you get like locked in this place. Like you got teleported to this place.

126
00:17:20,299 --> 00:17:28,200
I really think the John Jingleheimer Schmidt routine would actually benefit you. It really would

127
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:36,980
because I mean, look, at some point, like you're you're you're fucked here. You know what I mean?

128
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:43,960
What are you gonna do? No, I would just barrel down this hallway screaming John Jingleheimer

129
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,559
Schmidt and just throwing stuff around and like dancing and making like weird sound effects. I

130
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:50,519
think they'd be like, what the fuck is going on? Send this guy back out. We want somebody that's

131
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:54,539
like scared. We want somebody that's like, like, no, we don't want we don't want this guy. This

132
00:17:54,539 --> 00:18:10,359
guy's fucked up. Okay. What are you out? Okay. So it was from the last stream. It's a reference.

133
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:22,180
You need to out psycho the psycho. Just do the routine. We're like, are you not locked in here

134
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:28,259
with me? I'm locked in here with you. The other way around. It's me. You need to be afraid. Yeah,

135
00:18:28,259 --> 00:18:48,839
just start screaming that right? What is this? Oh, it's a shoe. Have I rotated? Oh, or just pull

136
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:57,369
the routine, the routine on them. Just find a really echoey part of this castle and just do

137
00:18:57,369 --> 00:19:06,279
their routine, you know, just sit there and just kind of go like they'll be like this. I'm supposed

138
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:12,660
to be doing that. Why are they doing that? It would just mess them all up. It would just walk

139
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:27,480
them up. Let me know. Okay, that's actually kind of scary. Oh, this is a memory. Anything I can do?

140
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:40,789
Is someone there? Dangerous here. What is? Why? Hang tight. I'm gonna see if I can find a key.

141
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:52,099
What? No, we don't know who's in there. That's such a Dark Souls room, by the way.

142
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:58,140
Talk through the door to like the weirdo. And am I just going to open the door?

143
00:20:11,099 --> 00:20:23,430
Okay, let me find a key. Do I have a map? Probably not. Not yet. Mirrors. What is that? Okay,

144
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:39,369
we're good. What's on it? Stop it from moving. Because it's weird and creepy. Yeah, it's creepy.

145
00:20:43,579 --> 00:21:00,470
Is there a key? I feel like someone's going to be in this room now. Oh, that's okay. That's my name.

146
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,829
I thought that was a cake for a second.

147
00:21:02,309 --> 00:21:14,230
Me! Fucking YouTuber. It's still in me. It's still there, by the way. I used to be a YouTuber,

148
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:26,440
okay? Years and years ago. What's this say? To create art, simply add to the rabbit's carcasses.

149
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:35,750
Decay is not an issue. Spruce them up a bit with makeup. It makes them seem more alive. Ah, all

150
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:42,309
right. Find the crystal. Find the key to the cell. Explore your surroundings. So I'm currently

151
00:21:42,309 --> 00:21:49,700
searching this area. I gotta view files in the journal. All right. Did the guy draw a picture

152
00:21:49,700 --> 00:22:01,240
of himself? Oh no, I did. Pretty good artist. Okay, all right, all right, all right. Why did

153
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:09,720
I think he did that? Maybe he handed me these notes just in case you forget who it is. It's me.

154
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:14,859
Honestly, this almost looks like, this almost looks like she held the paper up to his face

155
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:26,650
and shaded with a pencil. Like, that's how this picture came to be. Does that make any sense?

156
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:30,410
Those things are cool, by the way. It's like a little, all right, whatever. All right,

157
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:35,990
so where do I need to go? I need to go, I already went that way. I did not go up to the top left. So

158
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:47,420
let's just check to make sure there's nothing else here. Uh-huh, this way. I don't have any weapons.

159
00:22:47,420 --> 00:23:29,750
Is there a gun? Oh god. Okay, there's the key. Don't step in that. Can I not step in it? Okay,

160
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:37,349
I gotta sell key. I don't have any items. All right. Um, can I step in that or is it gonna hurt me?

161
00:23:38,069 --> 00:23:46,309
I guess I can go this way. Do I die if I step in that? I think I die if I touch that.

162
00:23:48,789 --> 00:24:05,140
Okay, just don't. It's in here, right? No, where is it? This way. Something's gonna break through

163
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:31,210
this door. Left? Okay, yep. How do I sprint? All right, it's right here. I think I need to make

164
00:24:31,210 --> 00:25:00,519
the game a little brighter. Who's in here? Watch out. Whatever it is, it's alive.

165
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:48,660
It's you. It's me. Literally me. That doesn't help. That doesn't help. Well, I mean, if we're

166
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:52,579
together, we may as well harmonize John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt. I think it would sound

167
00:25:52,579 --> 00:26:04,470
better. John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt. It'd be fucking sick. Yeah, well, I could do the high

168
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:21,029
part as long as you can do the low part. What are you doing? Oh, there's a way to sneak. Okay.

169
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:29,480
She's you. She can't do the low part. Oh, that's right. I didn't think about that.

170
00:26:42,170 --> 00:27:05,720
Get in there. Someone's gonna jump out. Oh, okay. What's going on? What's wrong?

171
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:15,109
There's another one? Quick, quick, quick before she dies. John Jacob Jingleheimer. That's all right.

172
00:27:15,109 --> 00:27:26,099
Never mind. I can do the low part. Why are there so many roses? Don't press any buttons.

173
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:36,650
Hey, are you listening to me? What are we looking for? Find the switch handle.

174
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,220
All right. I need the handle. We need to find the handle. Do you have a handle

175
00:27:50,059 --> 00:27:55,259
on the ground over here? Can I? Is it just there? Can I touch it? No. All right. I need a handle

176
00:27:57,289 --> 00:28:06,940
this way. Switch handles missing. Okay. Find that handle. Go deeper. What does this mean?

177
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:17,990
Oh, I can go up here. I locked in here. No, I'm going to go. I'm going to go this way first.

178
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:29,109
This looks interesting. Okay. That wasn't anything. That was an exit. Something's going to

179
00:28:29,109 --> 00:28:34,710
chase. Something's going to chase us around here without a doubt. That's definitely a way to escape

180
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:52,259
when a monster comes out here and attacks. All right. Let's sneak down there. I have a light,

181
00:28:52,259 --> 00:29:08,730
right? Yeah. Okay. This that way. Wait, what's the map look like? All right. What was that?

182
00:29:13,049 --> 00:29:25,880
What the fuck is that sound? Oh, this is behind where? Oh, this is these all me.

183
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:35,579
So many bodies. This one looks rendered. It's going to this one's rendered. You know what I'm

184
00:29:35,579 --> 00:29:40,630
saying? When I meet what I said, this isn't like a 3D rendered model. I'm telling you,

185
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:57,529
it's going to stand up. Nothing here. Ah, I'm telling you, these are rendered 3D models.

186
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:10,740
Anybody have a key? Nobody has a key. You don't have like the key or like on you somewhere.

187
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:31,859
Okay. Well, it's not here. I can't honestly, I've gotten jumpier in the last five years. I

188
00:30:31,859 --> 00:30:38,460
really have. I told you they were fucking rendered. They were rendered 3D models. I told you

189
00:30:39,099 --> 00:30:54,700
they literally rendered models. They've rendered 3D models. Okay. Unlock this. All right. We're

190
00:30:54,700 --> 00:31:49,880
okay. Straight right left. I want I've run button so bad. You have no idea. Oh, what the fuck? Oh,

191
00:31:49,880 --> 00:32:00,220
what are her powers then? Fucking electric hands. Are you kidding me? Just like force hands.

192
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:10,730
Oh shit. Why? Escape the monsters. All right. Press it. Press the button quick.

193
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:23,660
Oh shit. I'm sorry. Oh my God. They're coming from every angle. How do I get out of here?

194
00:32:29,660 --> 00:33:04,660
Open up. Hurry. Oh, God damn it. Oh, geez. Okay. We're good. All right. Here comes

195
00:33:13,349 --> 00:33:24,599
an invisible wall. Wait, can I go that way? I don't care. Excuse me. I have to go back. Um, how?

196
00:33:26,789 --> 00:33:36,500
Huh? There's no way to go. I can't get out of here. I'm trapped. Get the fuck out of the way.

197
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:40,500
How do I slide? Is there a slide button? This is probably a slide button, right?

198
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:51,210
How do I get out of here? Get out of the way. You're blocking the entrance. This is not fair.

199
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:55,210
Get out of the way. You've blocked the entrance. It's not fair. I got by.

200
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:18,710
I'm so fucked up. Am I going to make it this way? This way? Okay. All right. I made it.

201
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:27,050
Oh my God. They were blocking the entrance. That wasn't fair. All right. There's only one way to go.

202
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:40,539
Did I heal? Crouch and press Q to do a spin move. You made that up. There's no spin move.

203
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:51,659
There is no spin move. Talking about like, like zangief, like go, go, go, go, go. You

204
00:34:51,659 --> 00:35:19,690
spin with the fists out. No, you okay? What are you? I'm the narrator, not enemy friend.

205
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:31,030
What were those things? What is happening here? Leave now. What is this? Where am I?

206
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:43,099
Hell. Come on, write it. Go while you can. Not until I get this out of my body. There's a crystal

207
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:49,849
here that will remove the mold. I need to find it and I'm not leaving until I do.

208
00:35:50,570 --> 00:36:07,849
You're dangerous. Who are you? My guardian angel? Sure. That's funny. Do you have a name? If you're

209
00:36:07,849 --> 00:36:33,110
an angel, then Gabriel, Michael. Michael. Okay. Michael, what now? Dangerous here. Move. Who's

210
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:53,929
Michael? Okay. Where even am I? Okay. Oh, wait. There is a typewriter. Very cool. Game is saved.

211
00:36:53,929 --> 00:37:05,269
First aid. Yep. All right. Open inventory. I remember this. You can medicine that heals all

212
00:37:05,269 --> 00:37:14,570
wounds. Uh, isn't there a quick way to do it? There's a quick heal somehow, right? You can make

213
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:20,730
healing items too, from my understanding. I played the game. I, of course I understand it.

214
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:27,590
Why are you so wide today? I'm not. I'm gonna call it my hairline, a parallelogram. What does that

215
00:37:27,590 --> 00:38:03,530
mean? These poor things. So it's, it's the Duke, right? Yeah. I saw the trailer. So what is, is

216
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:20,099
the Duke a bad guy? I thought he was a good guy. I thought he, I thought he helped us. It's like we

217
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:32,230
caught another. Lively now, aren't you? You should have put that effort into running. It would have

218
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:42,630
made the chase that much more thrilling. Let me go. Let me go. It would seem this little rabbit lacks

219
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:57,110
the necessary fortitude. You had shown a little grit and actually escaped. That purifying crystal

220
00:38:57,110 --> 00:39:13,500
would now be yours. The crystal. Oh, now we have a new little rabbit to pursue. Let's see how fast

221
00:39:13,579 --> 00:39:25,639
this one is. I love this actor. He's great. Okay. I'm back and I'm ready to run.

222
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:45,690
There's a lot. Um, wait a minute. Okay. Where do I go? I can't open that. Dude. Oh my God. Okay.

223
00:39:45,690 --> 00:40:01,130
All right. What? Oh, come on. What the hell? A way out.

224
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:26,699
Um, back this way. I need to. Oh, all right. We're good. Need weapon. Gun.

225
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:42,739
Seriously. Where am I going to get a gun? Touch my words. What? Like this?

226
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:52,500
Okay. Well, if you didn't manifest me a rocket launcher in the first 10 minutes of the game,

227
00:40:52,500 --> 00:41:26,250
here we go. Point and shoot. Who is this tutorial text? Okay. His bullets. Third person is back. So

228
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:38,469
what's going on here? Can I shoot? Should I shoot this? Do the spin move? Okay. It's just,

229
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:41,750
all right. I get it. Actually, that's a good, that's actually good for me to know.

230
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:59,500
Acquire the crystal. All right. I can't go down here. No, I can't. Right. Okay. So that means,

231
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:07,320
where have I not gone? Straight through here. There's a door over this way. There's the crystal

232
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:19,219
right there. There it is. Just take it. A large crystal is glowing with a pale blue light. The

233
00:42:19,219 --> 00:42:23,940
disciples await their masks. Bronze, silver, gold with their, I guess I need to find these

234
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:30,170
masks to unlock it. Okay. With their garb array, the light shall be released. We need three masks

235
00:42:30,809 --> 00:42:42,630
to release the crystal. Okay. You got it. Shoot it. Shoot the glass. Not that easy. It's not that

236
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:56,820
simple. Check out grottobeast.com. Grottobeast.com. Not enough people here. I can talk about it.

237
00:42:56,820 --> 00:43:05,219
So, grottobeast.com is available right now. This, the website's not there. This is literally just a

238
00:43:05,219 --> 00:43:11,530
placeholder. But what is there is for you to drop an email. This is, this is going to the merch

239
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:20,409
company. .net also works too. .com redirects .net is there. Yep. You can put your email in,

240
00:43:20,409 --> 00:43:29,260
which will go to our fulfillment company to decide if you are interested in this product.

241
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:37,130
Grottobeast.com. That must mean it must be coming soon. The website is a placeholder.

242
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:43,659
We're only trying to see how many people are interested because what's grottobeasts?

243
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:52,179
Oh, we got a lot to tell you. So, grottobeast.com is a trading card game. It's been in development

244
00:43:52,179 --> 00:43:56,650
for about a year and a half. Fake fan. That's not a fake fan. I mean, you could have been

245
00:43:56,650 --> 00:44:08,550
started watching like six months ago, a month ago. New viewer Andy. But we're trying to see

246
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:13,420
the fulfillment company wants to kind of know how many people are interested because we need

247
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:19,989
to figure out how many we need to make to, you know, preliminarily. So, if you're interested,

248
00:44:19,989 --> 00:44:28,039
drop it there. It's not, no, it's a physical card. It's not digital. We're trying to garner

249
00:44:28,039 --> 00:44:37,860
some interest and see how it is. It's really fucking cool. There are 200 cards. It's a bunch

250
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:47,269
of characters from this universe as well as Grottobeasts. It's 200 fucking cards. It is an,

251
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:58,730
it's an enormous project. It is a game. There are 15 artists that have participated. I'm one of

252
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:11,099
them. That's right. I'm one of them. Physical NFTs. So, we're trying, what I really want to do is I

253
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:18,199
want to make sure that whoever wants them can get them. So, we really have no idea how many we need

254
00:45:18,199 --> 00:45:24,099
to make first. I don't want to have it be a case where there's like some odd hundred or some odd

255
00:45:24,099 --> 00:45:30,010
thousand amount of people that want them, but I don't, we don't make enough, right, in this first

256
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:37,900
pass. This is a huge project that has been, it's essentially like a gigantic community love letter,

257
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:44,360
essentially. It's tons of references to streams. There's tons of original characters that have

258
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:49,500
been created by all the artists. It's, it's really, really cool. Will it ship to the EU? Of course,

259
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:59,559
absolutely. This is not NA only. How much to ship international? These are questions that I do not

260
00:45:59,559 --> 00:46:06,949
have the answer to right now. All, all this is, that placeholder website is just there to just get

261
00:46:06,949 --> 00:46:12,230
an idea for the fulfillment company, how many people might actually be interested, and we're

262
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:20,179
going to go from there. Yeah, Holly had a huge amount to do with this, as well as all the other

263
00:46:20,179 --> 00:46:25,849
artists, and obviously all the other people that worked on it. It's been a big undertaking,

264
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:31,159
and it looks, it's fucking awesome, I'm telling you. There's a whole game. We have contracted out a

265
00:46:31,159 --> 00:46:36,250
game designer to make this whole thing. It's actually really fucking fun. It's actually fun.

266
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:46,889
It's very fun. Tweet the website, you monster. Yeah, so how it's going to work, because it's a

267
00:46:46,889 --> 00:46:52,409
game, we want to make sure that, because there'll be packs you can buy, right? Just booster packs.

268
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:58,489
But, did you, wait, did you actually call me a monster or not? So besides these booster packs,

269
00:46:58,489 --> 00:47:06,300
we're going to sell a kit, like a starter kit, to make sure monster packs? What did I say? Did

270
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:17,610
I just say monster packs? No, I said booster packs, right? Yeah, there's going to be holographics.

271
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:23,190
There's going to be all the shit that you are used to, right? But there's going to be a starter

272
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:27,500
kit that's going to be two full decks, so you don't have to worry about it. You can just buy it,

273
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:31,460
and if you want it, and have it. But we also thought it would be fun to have these booster

274
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:36,900
packs where you can open them and get like, oh my god, I got a, I got a, I got like a holographic

275
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:46,969
bugleberry. He's a card, by the way. And price point-wise, I don't want to, this is going to be

276
00:47:46,969 --> 00:47:53,800
something that I want to make sure is affordable, right? I don't want to do a thing where, oh yeah,

277
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:59,690
the card packs are fucking unbelievably egregious. No, no, it's not going to happen.

278
00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:05,159
I don't know what the price is going to be, but we're going to try to keep it reasonable.

279
00:48:05,159 --> 00:48:11,210
This is essentially just really interesting, a really interesting merch project that came about

280
00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:20,619
a year and a half ago after that stream. And we're finally almost ready to start showing it off.

281
00:48:20,619 --> 00:48:28,469
So, if it's a success, awesome. If it's not a success, it was fun to do. I just really hope

282
00:48:28,469 --> 00:48:34,250
you guys think they're cool. That's all I care about. It's just, are these cool? Is it fun merch?

283
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:42,099
Is the game fun? And the answer to those questions, I think, are all yes. So grottobeast.com,

284
00:48:42,099 --> 00:48:49,429
grottobeast.net. If you have any interest, please just fill out your email so you can be notified

285
00:48:49,429 --> 00:48:55,960
when it happens and we can figure out how much we need to make. Is auto a card? Yes, there are 200

286
00:48:55,960 --> 00:49:03,670
cards. And the starter deck, Holly, if you're here, do we know how many cards are in the starter deck?

287
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:08,389
Like, the starter kit that you can get that has two full decks and all of the materials you need.

288
00:49:08,389 --> 00:49:25,940
Do we know how many cards are in the starter? Do we have any idea? So, well, let me get this

289
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:32,199
accurate, but it's going to be, if you don't want to buy boosters and you just want, like,

290
00:49:32,199 --> 00:49:39,019
I believe the two decks have 41 cards each. Okay. So, you're going to be able to enjoy it if you

291
00:49:39,019 --> 00:49:45,139
don't want to just buy boosters, which I also want to try to do this meaningfully and have it

292
00:49:45,139 --> 00:49:53,909
be like orders, right? Rather than have it sell out as like, all right, that's it. We sold 1,500

293
00:49:53,909 --> 00:49:59,400
copies. Goodbye. It's over. It's limited. No, I don't want it to be limited in the sense that

294
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:06,039
it's deliberately limited. So, deliberately not as many people that want it can get it.

295
00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:15,050
There you go. Just go ask her. She's in your house. I'm like speaking into the air.

296
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:24,980
How many cards are in each deck? Do we know? Yeah. We're just trying to get some interest,

297
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:30,019
and that's it. I hope you enjoy it when it actually does come out. It's been a pretty long project,

298
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:39,000
which I will tell you, after spending the last year plus overseeing the development and being

299
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:46,710
part of a card game, it's a lot. The artists have spent a ton of time working on it. The game

300
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:53,000
designer has put tons of tons of love into it. I'm just excited for you to get in your hands.

301
00:50:53,000 --> 00:51:05,030
So, that was the announcement for today. What if nobody's interested? Well, and oh well,

302
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:15,000
it was fun to do it. Yeah, we've been waiting for the time to be able to tell people because

303
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,320
if you saw the Grotto Beast banner on the baseball stream was kind of there, and it's like, hey,

304
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:34,949
look, this thing's still a thing. Okay, it's okay, man. I'll buy it. If you are interested

305
00:51:34,949 --> 00:51:44,300
and you think it's cool, then yeah, I hope when you get it, I hope it's high quality.

306
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:49,420
I hope you enjoy it. We're trying to make it as good quality and price point, right? I look,

307
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:56,969
I'm trying. I'm going to catch them all. Why did I just say that out loud? You're going to collect

308
00:51:56,969 --> 00:52:05,619
all the cards. Whatever. All right, so let's keep going. So I have to go to find the three masks,

309
00:52:05,619 --> 00:52:20,300
which is I have not been through here yet. I have eight shots. Ooh, shotgun. I need a key.

310
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:39,880
Grant me that which sees the truth through its three eyes. I need a big key. I'm never going to

311
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:55,480
open this. Cut the chain. Okay, this is where the chain is. I need like a pair of pliers, right?

312
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:59,860
Should I shoot enemies or should I just say bullets till the end of the game and then

313
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:12,920
shoot the boss with 150 handgun rounds? Did I turn the flashlight off? Do I have a flashlight?

314
00:53:14,409 --> 00:53:29,880
Okay. Yeah, I. All right. How many shots does it take? You take way too many shots.

315
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:48,469
Oh, also there are two streams that I'm trying to do before the year ends. Two big ones,

316
00:53:48,469 --> 00:54:01,800
two of them. Why do I like I needed to pause for that, by the way. Ooh, cutters. I do have some

317
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:13,260
very sad news. That is a bad reverse announcement. I did tease. I did tease that Mr. Green's had

318
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:20,739
something in the pipeline and I got a phone call from Mr. Green's and he backed out. Mr. Green's

319
00:54:20,739 --> 00:54:26,019
is backed out. He told me to go fuck myself. That was literally his exact words. He thought it was

320
00:54:26,019 --> 00:54:34,010
he thought it was a dumb project. He said no. So I was like, OK, that stream is no longer currently

321
00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:50,019
in development. I have to say there are two others that currently are. So don't worry over here.

322
00:54:50,019 --> 00:54:54,500
What was it? I don't want to say because if for some reason I actually do go through with it,

323
00:54:55,750 --> 00:55:00,789
then if you really want to help, you could back me up against those things. Are you spawning in

324
00:55:00,789 --> 00:55:17,139
ammo? So I'm on my own. Thanks for the ammo. You spawned one small ammo box, just spawn a huge

325
00:55:17,139 --> 00:55:22,019
detonator or something. You know what I mean? Like, well, spawn a bunch of C4 throughout this

326
00:55:22,019 --> 00:55:30,869
whole place and then let me. What are you talking? Why are you doing this? OK, I need I got the

327
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:39,860
bolt cutters, which was over here. Right. You can't dodge a battle. Yes, I fucking can. I'm

328
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:53,079
so sick of seeing people write that. I'll prove it. Don't worry. Oh, this is the same place. So

329
00:55:53,079 --> 00:56:06,139
what is this? What is this thing? There's a gross lumpy thing growing here. Wasted a bullet. Right.

330
00:56:06,139 --> 00:56:14,809
There's got to be some serum I pour on that. Right. OK, I'm looking for the shotgun key.

331
00:56:19,829 --> 00:56:25,110
You can combine or urban chem fluid is a healing potion. Right. And then chem fluid and gunpowder

332
00:56:25,110 --> 00:56:31,989
is bullets. Right. Refresh my memory is one of these big things you want to do. Dodging a battle

333
00:56:31,989 --> 00:56:52,179
axe. It's trapped core. You mean that gross lumpy thing? How am I supposed to break it?

334
00:56:54,099 --> 00:57:09,449
Use your powers. My powers. I literally came here to get rid of them. Only way. OK, fine. But how?

335
00:57:10,329 --> 00:57:17,909
What am I supposed to do? I need an amplifier. Sorry, I'm biting my lip. What's that?

336
00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:33,380
I need to get an amplifier that way. Why is it a battle axe? Why not just a regular axe?

337
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:39,320
Because that's not what I said. I said a battle axe. I'm very confident in my ability to do

338
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:50,420
just what I described. OK, so I have to find an amplifier to use my powers on these

339
00:57:50,420 --> 00:58:05,320
plant things to get rid of them. Any ammo? OK, so those are obviously

340
00:58:06,389 --> 00:58:15,289
just scattered around the world here. All right. This is by the way, this is a fully 3D

341
00:58:15,289 --> 00:58:40,550
rendered model. It's standing up. Gunpowder. Nice. If you always want to tell if an enemy is going

342
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:46,980
to stand up or not, just look for like the aliasing, right? If something in the environment

343
00:58:46,980 --> 00:59:18,809
has aliasing, it's standing up. Yep. Look at the hair. I see the aliasing. Cam fluid. I can use

344
00:59:18,809 --> 00:59:25,059
these things and combine them. There might be more items to combine. I'm going to save it. I don't

345
00:59:25,059 --> 00:59:35,460
really need it for now. All right. The tutorial wants me to do it, so I'll just do it. So where

346
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:45,460
are we going here? All right. I can go this way or that way. This way. That way. Come on, Gwyn.

347
00:59:45,460 --> 01:00:37,349
That thing's standing up. How are you not dead? I shot you. OK. All right. We're good. Is that

348
01:00:37,349 --> 01:00:59,690
gunpowder? Somebody's going to jump off from behind a curtain. I don't have any bullets. OK.

349
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:10,920
I need bullets like right now. Oh, do I have a knife or anything? I don't have a knife. Oh,

350
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:16,250
come on. All right. I just got to run. Did I get what I needed from here? Oh,

351
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:29,989
cam fluid. Eight bullets. Is this the thing I'm looking for? Is this a stove? What is this?

352
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:46,389
It's a pizza oven. It looks like the lady from Beauty and the Beast. What's that? That's the

353
01:01:46,389 --> 01:02:00,519
lady at the big bureau. The cabinet. What is the cabinet from Beauty and the Beast? The teapot.

354
01:02:00,519 --> 01:02:05,639
There's no cabinet in Beauty and the Beast? Is there a huge cabinet in Beauty and the Beast?

355
01:02:09,769 --> 01:02:17,139
There is. Yeah. No, there is. The wardrobe. The bureau. OK. Sorry. Whatever. Yeah. This is

356
01:02:17,139 --> 01:02:30,250
the Mandela effect. You're thinking of the straight to VHS sequel. No way I'm waiting

357
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:48,219
through that. Can I like step on this stuff? It's a ladder here. OK, let's go. The wardrobe. OK.

358
01:02:48,219 --> 01:03:01,820
Yeah, it is. It is. Wait, this character was actually not in the regular movie. I think I'm

359
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:33,909
combining the teapot and the wardrobe into one character. OK. The wardrobe is in the movie,

360
01:03:33,909 --> 01:03:55,059
but I don't think wardrobe talks. Really? Yes, she does. Am I missing like important stuff

361
01:03:55,059 --> 01:04:08,280
because I'm just looking at off screen and climbing a ladder. I think we're good.

362
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:16,539
OK, stop turning the flashlight off. Yeah, keep it on. No, stop. Don't keep that flashlight on.

363
01:04:16,539 --> 01:04:39,769
Why would you turn it off in a dark, scary house? OK. Oh, something happened here.

364
01:04:46,869 --> 01:05:10,699
He's oozing. Am I? I shouldn't be. This. The juice box. OK. I have found a means of dramatically

365
01:05:10,699 --> 01:05:16,219
destabilizing parts of the mutamycete network by introducing a disruptive force to block the

366
01:05:16,219 --> 01:05:22,579
auto-inducers they use for communication. For example, the hard-packed cores of mold known as

367
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:30,869
slerotia begin to break down on a cellular level and disintegrate when this is disrupted.

368
01:05:30,869 --> 01:05:38,199
Slerotia form when the mutamycete develops in new locations, serving as sort of an anchor point or

369
01:05:38,199 --> 01:05:43,340
a foothold. They're often associated with a patch of liquid void for which the mold has spread.

370
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:49,159
When the auto-inducers of the slerotia are disrupted, it begins to break down. Any liquid

371
01:05:49,159 --> 01:05:56,280
void connected to the slerotia will also disintegrate. The moths are putting pictures of

372
01:05:56,280 --> 01:06:03,579
the wardrobe and they're contemplating if the clothes inside are the organs and guts and shit.

373
01:06:03,579 --> 01:06:11,289
I just looked, I'm sorry, it fucked me up. It would appear that destabilizing the slerotia

374
01:06:11,289 --> 01:06:17,030
sends a signal indicating that the location is no longer viable for mutamycete. Habitation.

375
01:06:17,110 --> 01:06:36,179
triggering a full-scale retreat or why can i just take these okay so there's the power uh

376
01:06:36,179 --> 01:06:49,269
increaser yes all right rw variant flask one actually looks good so what am i supposed to

377
01:06:49,269 --> 01:06:56,380
do that's definitely an alcohol you've seen that on the counter it's called like focus ice vodka

378
01:06:56,380 --> 01:07:05,420
that's what it looks like they make bottles like that that's just probably like 70 dollars too

379
01:07:06,219 --> 01:07:17,159
i feel different somehow use on core try now all right let's see if this works

380
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:30,980
is it one to one because there's a lot of those things so back to the courtyard that means we

381
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:34,500
have to go just kind of down and out of here all right is there anything else that i missed

382
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:51,699
anything that's a oh camphor good thing i stopped please turn on tips trust me focus here destroy

383
01:07:51,699 --> 01:08:08,869
mold cores oh i have like a mana bar does that do okay how many times can i do that

384
01:08:08,869 --> 01:08:31,560
i'll take the bullets there's another one here uh-huh so that stops the flow of lava

385
01:08:34,170 --> 01:08:43,239
okay well what's over here anything i can grab gunpowder good anything else

386
01:08:50,699 --> 01:08:59,399
move your camera up yeah good call i don't like taking up that much screen real estate though

387
01:08:59,399 --> 01:09:11,159
it's gotta be small still right back down to the courtyard am i right that hurt

388
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:21,319
fuck that hurt oh shit all right i'm okay i think i'm all right i think my knees would have gone

389
01:09:21,319 --> 01:09:27,560
up through my shoulders it would have been like and my knees would be up here you know what i

390
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:33,079
mean they'd be sticking out here and i would be like oh walking around that'd be so horrible

391
01:09:33,159 --> 01:09:45,420
can't get around it you need to get rid of it so where is it up here there it is

392
01:09:49,779 --> 01:10:04,170
that's an interesting mechanic that's a cool mechanic where is he where all right where

393
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:30,729
shit i missed way too much i missed two shots i should make some bolts then right all right i

that make sense like i missed a shot people are gonna omega l because i missed one bullet right

405
01:13:28,090 --> 01:13:33,180
that's like always up here in the back of my head this is like oops oh you missed one shot

406
01:13:34,060 --> 01:13:49,180
everyone's gonna omega l that looked like i had a hack enabled it was so good

407
01:13:49,979 --> 01:14:08,300
yeah they're gonna omega l me because i missed one shot right okay i'm just trying to clear

408
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:13,100
this place out because there's definitely things here to get there has to be stuff to collect

409
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:31,319
right yeah there's something in here i cleared all this out what's here nothing no there's no

410
01:14:31,319 --> 01:14:44,819
way it's a bunch of books really so i really should have just ran i just wasted like 15

411
01:14:44,819 --> 01:14:51,529
bullets for no reason you can uh you can omega l now you can you can i'll bet so omega l bad

412
01:14:51,529 --> 01:15:00,680
right yeah now you can do it now but one chem fluid i spent 10 bullets right all right that's

413
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:17,579
everything in here is it not one of those here whatever i feel like i could open this thing

414
01:15:17,579 --> 01:15:24,279
can i open this so we're gonna go back to the courtyard and get one of the masks

415
01:15:26,390 --> 01:15:41,819
but not yet what's in here you can't just all right you said so bad for like a full minute now

416
01:15:41,819 --> 01:16:07,340
rendered remember what was that okay look pretty big all i have is a handgun all right i can't do

417
01:16:07,340 --> 01:16:42,869
this yet what was that thing i think this is actually unlimited gunpowder very nice okay oh

418
01:16:42,869 --> 01:16:59,909
there's a mask what's in the back monocular door deep in the basement it needs this mask

01:16:59,909 --> 01:17:07,210
somebody will one of you guys remember that open this door yeah this is the dlc

420
01:17:07,210 --> 01:17:15,380
okay i can't do i think i have to put the mask on and look at it right that makes sense to me

421
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:24,520
in my brain any more of those uh boo things i don't think so all right let's just do it let's

all over the floor go into your g mod your gary's mod tool whatever it and look down and just hit

433
01:19:54,920 --> 01:20:03,850
like cue cue cue cue cue cue cue cue cue cue cue cue cue cue cue cue cue make it a joke

434
01:20:03,850 --> 01:20:13,800
imagine going into g mod and pressing q once to spawn one thing i don't buy it person's evil

01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:22,489
whoever it is no i want you to spawn 20 health packs and then i want you to spawn two zombies

436
01:20:22,489 --> 01:20:26,250
and put rocket ships on their backs and then activate them so they fly around the room and

437
01:20:26,250 --> 01:20:33,130
their arms and legs go everywhere and they smash into the walls and shit do it now you have the

438
01:20:33,130 --> 01:20:56,939
capability so do it so bronze oh it worked one of the lord's name are you talking about

439
01:20:56,939 --> 01:21:09,060
one of the lord's name all right so i can get rid of this let's just do that because it's here

440
01:21:09,779 --> 01:21:18,260
i should probably save it where is there a save point writer god i love resident evil games like

441
01:21:18,260 --> 01:21:24,250
this the new resident evil games are so awesome do you know why because i can just press v and

442
01:21:24,329 --> 01:21:30,920
know exactly where i am and exactly where i need to go i know i know exactly what i don't know i'm

443
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:36,359
not gonna get what i'm right here and the red is like bro you didn't complete this yet it's like

444
01:21:36,359 --> 01:21:42,220
it's perfect like do this something in here that you can do it's red all the blue don't even look

445
01:21:42,220 --> 01:21:47,659
at this don't even pay attention to see this red up here that you can go up there man oh it's i love

446
01:21:47,659 --> 01:22:06,380
it they really it's such great design it's literally not okay so this opens up back where i was

447
01:22:06,859 --> 01:22:18,979
is this where the duke guy is oh my god these things are everywhere i know you think it's fun

448
01:22:18,979 --> 01:22:26,869
to delete my beautiful creatures but you will find out soon enough why that is stupid of you

449
01:22:27,670 --> 01:22:41,189
come on i know you want to do it let's just open this minus two that was not a bad impression but

450
01:22:41,189 --> 01:22:48,260
the dialogue was like an ai writing it each word was after the next one you know what i mean that

451
01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:54,500
was like oh i'm like the substance is not there but the voice kind of is it was i'm just saying

452
01:22:54,500 --> 01:23:03,640
words after other words and the words don't really connect at all i'm but remember i'm being speech

453
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:14,920
jammed that's very that's very stupid of you you will i always want to hear that back oh this is

454
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:28,069
where the duke sat remember he was right here there's no way the duke was sitting in that chair

455
01:23:28,069 --> 01:23:49,939
oh christmas lights okay i do not recall a single thing not who i am know how i came to

456
01:23:49,939 --> 01:23:56,220
be i know nothing my memories are as broken as the face i hide behind this mask all that remains

457
01:23:56,220 --> 01:24:00,859
is this feeling this hunger to see others in pain the despair in their eyes the sounds of their

458
01:24:00,859 --> 01:24:07,189
screams who will be my next quarry i have my minion to do my bidding he has many faces but

459
01:24:07,189 --> 01:24:12,310
no brains within those skulls he is my best hound and he will chase those rabbits down

460
01:24:12,310 --> 01:24:22,979
oh here's the impression okay let me hear it i know you think it's fun to delete my beautiful

461
01:24:22,979 --> 01:24:41,640
creatures but you will find out soon enough why that is stupid of you that guy does not have a

462
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:48,460
plan by the way that guy's over the pa and he's just like fuck oh i don't i don't have a plan

463
01:24:48,460 --> 01:24:54,500
but i gotta make something up to scare this girl because i got no plan at all it's stupid of you

464
01:24:59,770 --> 01:25:08,489
one more time that was bad i know you think it's fun to delete my beautiful creatures that was

465
01:25:08,569 --> 01:25:12,409
fine that first part is okay and then it was like what do i say after this i don't know what should

466
01:25:12,409 --> 01:25:19,989
i say after this but you will find out soon enough why that is stupid of you but you will find out

467
01:25:19,989 --> 01:25:24,970
soon enough those are all filler words because right there i was let me give some acting skills

468
01:25:24,970 --> 01:25:33,029
acting class that was me saying nothing to think of what i should actually say after that and what

469
01:25:33,029 --> 01:25:38,789
i said after that was not good my brain didn't come up with anything why that is so remember

470
01:25:38,789 --> 01:25:43,189
these are all filler words but you will find out soon enough but you will find out soon enough

471
01:25:43,189 --> 01:25:46,789
it's just i didn't even say those words they came out they just started happening like i

472
01:25:46,789 --> 01:25:53,750
didn't even say those why that is and you will find out soon enough why that is you can even

473
01:25:53,750 --> 01:25:59,590
hear it listen listen to this noise voice it's i break a little and you find out why that is

474
01:26:00,710 --> 01:26:12,869
stupid of acting 101 do filler words until you actually come up with a thing you want to say

475
01:26:13,430 --> 01:26:19,260
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah down the right hallway right like

the frog because the frog will eat the butterfly the frog is scared of the spider whom is very

545
01:43:38,890 --> 01:43:57,590
stealthy then the sheep is scared of the sheep likes to eat the spider the extra protein um we

565
01:49:05,210 --> 01:49:09,289
he's like hey you know that people like apparently people don't like make fun of me because they have

566
01:49:09,289 --> 01:49:13,210
like superpowers i was like hey you know there's a way to get rid of those superpowers if you'd go

567
01:49:13,210 --> 01:49:18,170
and it's i have this lab and there's these notes that somebody left that like you can remove those

568
01:49:18,170 --> 01:49:22,250
powers so you just are kind of a you go back to being a regular person you don't have powers

569
01:49:22,250 --> 01:49:26,149
anymore uh so i touched this thing that was supposed to be this thing that gets me into the

570
01:49:26,149 --> 01:49:49,659
memories of um of the mutant my seat or something and that's where we are it is easy to get your

571
01:49:49,659 --> 01:50:08,119
grabby paws okay dude that resident evil 4 remake i think could be like the best game ever made

572
01:50:08,760 --> 01:50:13,720
i really hope it is the resident evil 2 the resident evil 3 remake was was okay it was not

573
01:50:13,720 --> 01:50:22,789
okay it was okay god the resident evil 2 remake is one of the best remakes i've ever played

574
01:50:22,789 --> 01:50:27,430
what's that sound that was game of the year for me when it came out that game was so phenomenal

575
01:50:27,430 --> 01:50:38,979
it was awesome i hope that it's the resident evil team team he hates elden ring no it's gonna i'm

576
01:50:38,979 --> 01:50:46,180
telling you if resident evil 4 is it coming out this year resident evil 4 doesn't need a

577
01:50:46,180 --> 01:50:52,899
remake resident evil 2 did need a remake um yeah it's it's interesting because when i saw the

578
01:50:52,899 --> 01:50:57,300
the gameplay trailer for resident evil 4 i kind of my eyes were kind of squinting i was like

579
01:50:58,020 --> 01:51:03,510
wait this is not the get i thought it was just a remaster i was like oh it's just a fresh coat of

580
01:51:03,510 --> 01:51:07,750
paint but it that the whole thing is redone it's like weird to look at it's like whoa wait a minute

581
01:51:07,750 --> 01:51:13,500
this is not just like a remaster it's they redid the whole entire game it's it's really weird to

582
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:22,329
look at welcome to the gallery of despair a wondrous display of those few who succeeded

583
01:51:22,329 --> 01:51:27,800

584
01:51:27,800 --> 01:51:32,789
despair are preserved forever in this gallery witness in this collection of the light of life

585
01:51:32,789 --> 01:51:43,220

649
02:09:29,510 --> 02:09:45,350
weird area all right so i have the second mask all right this is this room which i don't need

650
02:09:45,350 --> 02:10:06,260
to do anymore i got the mask when we had to oh wait what down here i can't move this might as

651
02:10:06,260 --> 02:10:19,699
well all right so i can't open that door so i'm gonna go back to the i gotta go downstairs snake

652
02:10:19,699 --> 02:10:32,250
painting cool all right so where's that painting room can you let us bet say something what there

653
02:10:32,250 --> 02:10:47,460
were a big amount of subs oh yeah i appreciate it i really do thank you so much i really do but i

654
02:10:47,460 --> 02:10:55,350
don't i don't shout out subs anymore four bits uh i don't i don't do it i really appreciate it though

655
02:10:56,340 --> 02:11:03,239
uh i don't shout out bits or subs anymore because i uh i don't do i have to go through this

656
02:11:03,239 --> 02:11:11,739
if i go through this it was 50 subs it's a lot of subs it is i appreciate it but i don't shout out

657
02:11:11,739 --> 02:11:18,630
subs or bits anymore i just don't it was a decision i made a couple years ago and i have to stick to

658
02:11:18,630 --> 02:11:29,909
it i am sorry if you uh want me to address big amounts of subs and bits but if i do that

659
02:11:30,710 --> 02:11:35,270
let's say i start only addressing the ones that are 50 or 100 subs or something like that right

660
02:11:35,989 --> 02:11:41,939
that incentivizes people that oh well that's now he'll incentivize people to give more

661
02:11:42,500 --> 02:11:45,720
because if i don't say the person that's subbed just for one month or whatever

662
02:11:46,359 --> 02:11:51,479
but if you do give 100 subs i will see it and i'll talk about it so that's kind of why and i

663
02:11:51,479 --> 02:11:57,369
honestly i don't want to i don't want to put pressure on the community or myself if i'm on

664
02:11:57,369 --> 02:12:02,810
us too because i really don't want uh the stream like i've talked about years in the past but we'll

665
02:12:02,810 --> 02:12:09,050
bring it up again i don't want you to be essentially incentivized to pay me money for me to like say

666
02:12:09,050 --> 02:12:16,779
something or talk to you i don't like that i never have um i think it's it's kind of healthier if you

667
02:12:16,779 --> 02:12:22,569
just if you decide that you're you like the stream and you want to sub then that's all there is to

668
02:12:22,569 --> 02:12:28,819
it right or if you want to give gifted subs i really appreciate it but i i don't really want

669
02:12:28,819 --> 02:12:35,220
to turn the stream into a way to incentivize oh well if i give 50 subs or 100 subs then he'll

670
02:12:35,220 --> 02:12:41,399
talk he'll he'll he'll bring it up um and let me be very very clear to whoever just gave 50 subs

671
02:12:41,399 --> 02:12:51,050
that's fucking amazing um that's thank you but i you know i don't want to just you know what i'm

672
02:12:51,050 --> 02:12:58,630
saying you get it he doesn't want your money i would rather you buy yourself a fucking nice

680
02:15:08,630 --> 02:15:39,180
right so i gotta go left and put the mask on okay and then wait can i get the shotgun no i can't

681
02:15:39,180 --> 02:15:48,810

754
02:37:46,569 --> 02:37:51,209

755
02:37:51,209 --> 02:37:54,649
from me and it's going to be in this little crystal and the person that's coaching me is

756
02:37:54,649 --> 02:38:11,139
the one that's going to benefit from this right that's at least i feel like it's happening um

757
02:38:11,139 --> 02:38:15,700
before i placed that i do want to go straight and left i'm going to go to the salon it looks

germa on tiktok huh that's more than every channel I have combined like times 10

1100
04:27:05,840 --> 04:27:10,559
and where I do what I don't know why am I not on that why am I not getting any of that

1101
04:27:11,680 --> 04:27:38,479
why am I not getting any of that what oh that's what are you kidding me it was seen at some point

1102
04:27:38,479 --> 04:27:43,920
during my experiments with consciousness an intruder made herself at home in my realm

1103
04:27:43,920 --> 04:27:52,930
this intruder was none other than the failure Evelyn who's been running about enacting her

1104
04:27:52,930 --> 04:27:58,260
own pitiful agenda which has led to a slight disruption in my own plans had Evelyn not

1105
04:27:58,260 --> 04:28:05,149
interfered Rosemary Winters would have been on the verge of despair dispossessed of her will

1106
04:28:05,149 --> 04:28:12,030
to live and her view to my side powers instead a new passion burns within her I shall have to

1107
04:28:12,030 --> 04:28:27,120
extinguish the duke talking that was a lot of bullets oh yeah it's final battle time I had

1108
04:28:27,120 --> 04:28:31,680
intended to duplicate Rosemary Winters with the hope that a perfect replica might serve as a

1109
04:28:31,680 --> 04:28:37,360
suitable vessel however the results were less than ideal it would seem that some sort of

1110
04:28:37,360 --> 04:28:42,239
interference is preventing me from creating a suitable replica instead I have succeeded in

1111
04:28:42,239 --> 04:28:48,000
making what is essentially a living doll it resembles the real thing yes but has no power

1112
04:28:48,000 --> 04:28:54,750
such a pathetic hus could never prove suitable as a vessel I will continue my efforts in hope of

1113
04:28:54,750 --> 04:29:00,739
discerning the source of this interference several hypotheses have come to mind thus far

1114
04:29:00,739 --> 04:29:08,260
the fact that rose herself is still alive some other actor within this realm me a flaw in my

1115
04:29:08,260 --> 04:29:13,889
methods of production none of these seem especially likely to be the sole reason or any of them easy

1116
04:29:13,889 --> 04:29:23,340
problems to solve perhaps my best hope is to somehow bring rose into this realm 225 million

1117
04:29:23,340 --> 04:29:35,520
views on another version of germa on tick tock do I have like two billion fucking views what

1118
04:29:37,420 --> 04:29:44,030
how many views do I have on twitch I don't think I have 100 million 50 million maybe

1119
04:29:44,829 --> 04:30:01,420
on YouTube I have like three 400 million a billion I'm shy I'm so confused right I'm shocked

1120
04:30:01,420 --> 04:30:08,379
flexing no guys I start these are not my accounts these are not my accounts I'm not I mean flex

1121
04:30:08,379 --> 04:30:19,180
this is not a flex hey two billion don't look at my fucking armpits get on tick tock I'm not

1122
04:30:19,180 --> 04:30:25,760
getting on tick tock I'm already there I have two billion views okay further experiments with these

1123
04:30:25,760 --> 04:30:30,079
rose copies as I've taken to calling these husks have you looked another interesting wrinkle to

1124
04:30:30,079 --> 04:30:42,319
pursue somebody uploaded all of the dollhouse across like 200 parts as like all right when

1125
04:30:42,319 --> 04:30:46,000
subjected to situations evoking extreme terror they actually begin to express some semblance

1126
04:30:46,000 --> 04:30:51,229
of roses abilities this warrants more research and I think that by first creation the masked duke

1127
04:30:51,790 --> 04:31:00,180
is just the one to wait hold on a minute this warrants more research and I think

1128
04:31:00,180 --> 04:31:05,860
that my first creation the masked duke is just the one to perform the stress test

1129
04:31:05,860 --> 04:31:11,379
so this is not the real duke watching me the entire time so the that's this is not duke this

1130
04:31:11,379 --> 04:31:51,700
is a masked duke okay we already saw that no he didn't did we okay all right I'm glad that

1131
04:31:51,700 --> 04:31:58,379
that's not the real duke the mega my seat absorbs the memories of all life within its reach but

1132
04:31:58,379 --> 04:32:02,700
there are laws which govern this world within it seems worthwhile to catalog them as they become

1133
04:32:02,700 --> 04:32:10,239
apparent the memories that comprise this realm do not strictly reflect reality only those who

1134
04:32:10,239 --> 04:32:15,440
are attuned to the meta my seat in life retain control of their faculties here in this realm

1135
04:32:16,000 --> 04:32:20,879
it aligns with my understanding of the mega my seat has revealed to me and its visions before

1136
04:32:20,879 --> 04:32:28,020
my death yes my death my physical body is gone absorbed into the mega my seat and yet I do not

1137
04:32:28,020 --> 04:32:33,540
despair this fate has granted me fascinating insights all those years I strived have continued

1138
04:32:33,540 --> 04:32:39,090
to strive they're not for nothing the memories the consciousness understanding and knowledge I

1139
04:32:39,090 --> 04:32:45,489
accumulated in life have transferred here to the mega my seat where it serves as a source of power

1140
04:32:45,489 --> 04:32:51,500
within this realm if I can harness this power I believe I can use it to affect the thoughts and

1141
04:32:51,500 --> 04:32:56,620
memories of others of course it's hardly a perfect arrangement with so many minds and memories

1142
04:32:56,700 --> 04:33:00,620
gathered here finding and retrieving a single person from amidst the rabble has proven an

1143
04:33:00,620 --> 04:33:07,419
immense challenge her memories are here yes but dissolute perhaps what is needed is the right

1144
04:33:07,419 --> 04:33:13,180
vessel into which to hold her and of course I know of the perfect vessel the only real candidate in

1145
04:33:13,180 --> 04:33:21,250
all my years of searching rosemary winters this is the guy we saw on the bench in the beginning

1146
04:33:21,250 --> 04:33:37,419
is this like this is his project or something I don't even know who that guy was okay so cool I

1147
04:33:37,419 --> 04:33:41,419
guess we know what we're doing now we're gonna pick up all this stuff there's a lot of ammo

1148
04:33:42,220 --> 04:33:53,310
let's take a quick look over here no one deeper you're losing viewers dude do a joke

1149
04:33:55,090 --> 04:34:09,500
oh fuck all right I'll do something wicked funny there's that feeling again it's so strong it must

1150
04:34:09,500 --> 04:34:16,750
be the crystal that pole I've been feeling is close but I just can't go any further I thought

1151
04:34:16,750 --> 04:34:21,790
I made it when I saw that blue light but no not quite only I've been braver faster stronger so

1152
04:34:21,790 --> 04:34:29,540
close I was so close I'm almost there it's your birthday today cake and ice cream is on its way

1153
04:34:35,340 --> 04:34:51,779
cool it's through here how would you even know that you you actually would not know that okay

1154
04:34:51,779 --> 04:35:00,209
here we go here's the here's the open book to the exact page presented on what happened in the story

1155
04:35:00,209 --> 04:35:07,709
here we go black god which lives in us in which we live create for us a new world as befits your

1156
04:35:07,709 --> 04:35:13,310
will your dark consciousness holds for us a second chance graciously offered and joyously

1157
04:35:13,310 --> 04:35:19,470
accepted you drink the blood of the lost lamb as it falls upon your darkened earth not to destroy

1158
04:35:19,470 --> 04:35:33,360
but to preserve and once again deliver it onto life what a twist what an ad what a twist I can't

1159
04:35:33,360 --> 04:35:49,389
believe it was Cthulhu the whole time I'm so sarcastic this one's the real deal feel it here

1160
04:35:49,389 --> 04:36:07,979
it is what do you think that smells like I think it smells like paint like that smells like a fresh

1161
04:36:07,979 --> 04:36:33,360
thing of paint it just probably smells like paint thinner or something is this what normal feels like

1162
04:36:33,360 --> 04:36:54,290
uh-oh here it is the person behind it all Evelyn who is this again rose Miranda I've waited so long

1163
04:36:55,090 --> 04:37:11,299

1164
04:37:11,299 --> 04:37:16,900
directly fully I knew where the crystal was I had to lure you into this realm I've been searching

1165
04:37:16,900 --> 04:37:33,470

nobody can touch the moon it's too far away wait what if he has a rocket ship

1241
04:56:59,869 --> 04:57:10,659
okay then you can touch your butt it'd be very very cool you were being silly I don't think the

1242
04:57:11,619 --> 04:57:37,439
two out of ten mad mad no just that what for that one 10 second period it was a two out of ten

1243
04:57:38,450 --> 04:57:44,959
hey dad everything else was like a it was solid it was fun I think it was worth playing it was

1244
04:57:44,959 --> 04:57:52,340
okay sorry I missed I'll explain I have a lot of tests coming up you know how it is

1245
04:57:56,959 --> 04:58:00,400
I played some really shit DLC before this was this was pretty good

1246
04:58:02,750 --> 04:58:22,060
duty calls that second part with the the dolls where else today of all days wait we have a

1247
04:58:22,060 --> 04:58:31,840
situation you're needed Evelyn don't you ever call me that again it's just a joke this is the end of

1248
04:58:31,840 --> 04:58:40,290
the first end of the game I can show you things even Chris doesn't know I can do so this cut

1249
04:58:40,290 --> 04:59:03,580
scene takes place stand down I want you to keep it together Rose you're a lot like him you know

1250
04:59:03,580 --> 04:59:20,130
I know wasn't there like a weird ending here where they had there was somebody standing here

1251
04:59:20,130 --> 04:59:43,580
we're gonna see who it is I remember asking that same question at the end of the base game I enjoyed

1252
04:59:43,580 --> 04:59:47,819
that that was fun okay that one segment where I was having trouble with the understanding the

1253
04:59:47,819 --> 04:59:51,099
parry I didn't get it I thought it was it just suck I thought it was an absorb I didn't think

1254
04:59:51,099 --> 04:59:56,849
it was a parry that was two out of ten everything else was solid the horror parts were awesome

1255
04:59:57,729 --> 05:00:02,479
that was scary shit man I think it was a solid buy here this is a solid buy and there's still

1256
05:00:02,479 --> 05:00:07,439
more to see because I want to do the other stuff I want to look at the other stuff there's like a

1257
05:00:07,439 --> 05:00:14,060
whole other thing to do you can play as Lady Demetrius and um what's the other guy the

1258
05:00:14,060 --> 05:00:25,459
mechanical guy I want to try it I thought that was very I enjoyed that that whole second segment

1259
05:00:25,459 --> 05:00:44,580
was terrifying I actually honestly I really liked eight I did like eight I thought it was really

1260
05:00:44,580 --> 05:00:53,549
good as a complete picture here as the whole thing's done at this point right I actually

1261
05:00:53,549 --> 05:01:08,159
enjoyed eight what do you rate it I don't know I don't have it's a DLC how do you rate a DLC

1262
05:01:08,159 --> 05:01:13,840
it's like to me DLC is either buy it or don't I it's not an you know what I mean it's like an

1263
05:01:13,840 --> 05:01:25,979
edition the Resident Evil 8 is like an 8.5 8.4 for me at least what all right let's what did I rate

1264
05:01:25,979 --> 05:01:39,150
it like a year ago when I played it I gave it a rating I think eight's better than seven you gave

1265
05:01:39,150 --> 05:01:48,110
it a seven I think it was like it was a high seven I think low eight eight point two honestly it's

1266
05:01:48,110 --> 05:01:53,950
hard to say if I prefer seven or eight because I played eight more recently and it's been a one

1267
05:01:53,950 --> 05:02:00,509
guys something I think a lot of people might not know it's hard for me to give a good scoring

1268
05:02:00,509 --> 05:02:08,529
system here considering I played the entire game of Resident Evil 7 in VR I played that on the PS

1269
05:02:08,529 --> 05:02:14,209
VR at launch because it was exclusive and it was a I was like holy shit I'm gonna do that I don't

1270
05:02:14,209 --> 05:02:21,680
know why I did that that was so I should not have done that but I did the entire game from start to

1271
05:02:21,759 --> 05:02:29,549
finish in VR so I don't know maybe I'll have it I would have a different opinion if I played it

1272
05:02:29,549 --> 05:02:48,500
normally I don't know I'm feeling really bad after some of those streams it was funny all right we're

1273
05:02:48,500 --> 05:03:01,659
gonna get a post credits thing or should I just skip it just let us know now there's no after

1274
05:03:01,659 --> 05:03:12,830
credits thing hey wow this is great this is awesome because this is exactly what I told you was going

1275
05:03:12,830 --> 05:03:17,549
to happen exactly what I told you somebody said dude it's a three and a half hour experience if

1276
05:03:17,549 --> 05:03:22,750
you just play it three and a half hours right so 340 I've been streaming for five hours that is one

1277
05:03:22,750 --> 05:03:28,639
hour and 20 minutes of nonsense that's one hour and 20 minutes of me just talking and just like

1278
05:03:28,639 --> 05:03:39,139
pausing and talking and saying weird shit I told you this is gonna happen okay cool you've completed

1279
05:03:39,139 --> 05:03:44,180
the following challenge completion points can be used to purchase items in the extra content shop

1280
05:03:45,069 --> 05:03:55,650
oh did I just buy something I hope I just didn't buy something you mean I could have had this on

1281
05:03:55,650 --> 05:04:02,049
the whole did I have this the whole time or did I just unlock this what I feel like I had that

1282
05:04:02,049 --> 05:04:14,299
already okay so what let me see there's an extra content shop oh okay the mercenaries additional

1283
05:04:14,299 --> 05:04:28,720
orders this is the other thing I want to see but wait okay I got it special weapon 80,000 how many

1284
05:04:28,720 --> 05:04:42,220
do I only have 32,000 I thought I just had way more than that well you can play as the baby oh no

1285
05:04:43,099 --> 05:04:56,880
I was like how did they handle this okay um do I actually have to unlock them or are they just in

1286
05:04:56,880 --> 05:05:13,180
the game they're probably just in the game okay additional orders all right Ethan Chris oh there's

1287
05:05:13,180 --> 05:05:25,099
two other characters all right I'm gonna try it I'll go with Ethan how does this how do I play this

1288
05:05:29,599 --> 05:05:38,430
there he is that's the duke okay the mercenaries first purchase any equipment weapons you need

1289
05:05:38,430 --> 05:05:43,490
from the shop then you go out to the field you need to defeat as many enemies as possible

1290
05:05:43,490 --> 05:05:49,040
in the time limit get a good rhythm going and build up combos okay the goal will appear touch

1291
05:05:49,040 --> 05:05:58,319
the goal to finish move on to the next area okay this thing's pretty explanatory welcome

1292
05:05:58,319 --> 05:06:10,639
Ethan I have 20,000 this is all an investment Ethan bye um okay you're going to be so bad at

1293
05:06:10,639 --> 05:06:19,099
this I I just want to unlock the I don't think I can upgrade anything oh I can shit all right

1294
05:06:19,099 --> 05:06:24,380
well should I buy securing goods is more important than anything I buy the shotgun immediately my

1295
05:06:24,380 --> 05:06:29,259
friend I hope this one makes itself useful I'm gonna buy the shotgun and I'm gonna upgrade the

1296
05:06:29,259 --> 05:06:47,020
shotgun's capacity what an idiot okay now I'm gonna buy shotgun ammo I can't choose wisely

1297
05:06:47,020 --> 05:06:52,860
your luck till next we meet oh I got a lot okay all right let's I'm gonna just go make some um

1298
05:06:52,860 --> 05:07:40,659
let's go get an a rank in a normal stage you got it let's go what is this

1299
05:07:40,819 --> 05:08:12,590
I think that's pretty good whoa shotgun ammo load it load it load it load the shotgun

1300
05:08:18,779 --> 05:08:51,099
the goal has spawned wait what's this oh where's the goal where's it cool get an a rank or above in

1301
05:08:51,099 --> 05:08:57,020
all normal stages you need to get an s rank or above oh my god am I gonna be able to even do that

1302
05:08:57,979 --> 05:09:10,299
if it's just looking window shop away this simple modification can be done in just a moment

1303
05:09:18,020 --> 05:09:27,869
this is all an investment even till next we meet more kills and more points all right

1304
05:09:29,459 --> 05:09:37,150
okay let's just round everybody up then oh my god why is it so fucking loud it's

1305
05:09:37,229 --> 05:09:39,069
louder 10 times louder than the base game

1306
05:09:41,310 --> 05:10:57,919
where are they stop it stop it whatever use yep all right where are they where's where's the

1307
05:10:57,919 --> 05:12:17,740
enemies can an enemy spawn where where is an enemy where the fuck are the enemies this guy sucks

1308
05:13:24,610 --> 05:13:30,180
pick the gun gun gun man I pressed it like three times

1309
05:13:30,180 --> 05:13:57,540
easy this stage sucks ass fuck this stage worse stage in the game that stage was awful

1310
05:13:58,259 --> 05:14:00,799
like they're up here they're down here they're down here they're up there they're up there

1311
05:14:00,799 --> 05:14:18,159
they're up there oh fuck this area okay I was just thinking of ways to pass the time

1312
05:14:22,880 --> 05:14:29,659
choose wisely your life may depend on it okay more shotgun I'm doing rate of fire

1313
05:14:30,619 --> 05:14:38,639
and reload it's fine all finished and then rate of fire this thing is so slow

1314
05:14:41,540 --> 05:14:59,520
all right now that's better let's go thank you for your speed increased speed increase

1315
05:15:18,110 --> 05:15:43,779
why was this gun where did you whoa open it open it open it open it open it open it

1316

1320
05:18:35,389 --> 05:19:05,950
how do I know what I got for scores on them A I need to get an A in every single one of these

1321
05:19:05,950 --> 05:19:23,790
no in the normal stages oh okay so wait wait wait wait go back so I'm imagining that these are

1322
05:19:23,790 --> 05:19:32,700
probably only a few of these are normal stages you need A in all and S on the last one okay

1323
05:19:32,700 --> 05:19:47,150
let's see what I can do here I think I'm gonna go with um hmm all right this is I'm going for

1324
05:19:47,150 --> 05:19:50,750
a weird play here I'm gonna try to I'm not gonna spend any money I'm gonna buy the SMG

1325
05:19:50,750 --> 05:20:10,689
I'm skilled at all sorts maybe let's just do this for now this might be dumb but I'm gonna do it

1326
05:20:10,689 --> 05:20:45,419
thank you for your patronage oh oh my god I don't remember these guys how do I fight these guys

1327

I don't remember how to fight these guys I think they're thinking they're back right

1328
05:20:50,979 --> 05:21:21,490
I don't remember I think it's on their back um what do you get stuck in the wall or

1329
05:21:22,209 --> 05:21:34,340
I don't know how do you kill these guys I need explosives

1333
05:24:16,930 --> 05:24:25,520
gonna get A if I don't get at least an A on this then I quit I didn't really put time into this

1334
05:24:25,520 --> 05:25:42,669
mode but it's fun this is all an investment this is just a moment all right let's go oh it's so loud

1336
05:28:00,590 --> 05:28:15,939

1337
05:28:15,939 --> 05:28:39,500
that was clean that's gonna carry this whole playthrough I like this this one I think was

1338
05:28:39,500 --> 05:29:19,580
going one gun Andy I think right why was that that was so fast I'll do one gun Andy okay here we go

1381
05:52:20,259 --> 05:52:25,330
thank you for bringing that to my attention all right I'm kind of sweaty and I think that's

1382
05:52:25,330 --> 05:52:40,700
probably it for tonight this was fun plus I'm lost in the concrete level I'm lost in the concrete

1383
05:52:40,700 --> 05:52:54,450
level I give up I give up yeah I'll see you tomorrow thanks for joining me uh I thought I

1384
05:52:54,450 --> 05:52:57,569
kind of really got into this I didn't think I was gonna flame this for six hours but tomorrow

1385
05:52:58,880 --> 05:53:06,669
we're gonna be doing Phasmophobia with Vinnie and friends and then after that

1386
05:53:07,310 --> 05:53:12,740
I'm gonna play at dead of night and if I beat that then we'll do another scary game

1387
05:53:12,740 --> 05:53:23,409
should be fun I'm gonna quit that was cool though I like that maybe I'll play that on my own just

1388
05:53:23,409 --> 05:53:40,159
mess around is there anything else to see is that the FMV game I don't know it's like you're running

1389
05:53:40,159 --> 05:53:47,919
around a hotel or something third person for the main campaign yeah that's cool I feel like you

1390
05:53:47,919 --> 05:53:53,869
can play through the entire game in third person to be a different game and then on Halloween yeah

1391
05:53:53,869 --> 05:54:05,119
Halloween I'm doing uh the cooking show with critical with Charlie that should be fun should

1392
05:54:05,119 --> 05:54:12,419
be fun the internet held up today which is kind of strange we're usually pretty used to it somewhere

1393
05:54:12,419 --> 05:54:19,970
around like an hour ago dying so I'm just gonna pull my streams back an hour or two to try to

1394
05:54:19,970 --> 05:54:34,860
avoid it I am so sweaty Jesus the idea is I'm trying to avoid being live between eight and ten

1395
05:54:34,860 --> 05:54:40,619
so until I can get it fixed so I reliably know it's not gonna happen because it's just so weird

1396
05:54:40,619 --> 05:54:58,180
very strange but yeah I will see you guys tomorrow I'll see you guys very soon a couple more scary

1397
05:54:58,180 --> 05:55:06,259
games tomorrow what time tomorrow 2 p.m pacific tomorrow and then what time on Halloween that's

1398
05:55:06,259 --> 05:55:12,459
a good question I think they usually I think Charlie usually is around noon right I'm pretty

1399
05:55:12,459 --> 05:55:22,240
sure it's probably gonna be around noon on Halloween that will be live 2 p.m tomorrow what about stay

1400
05:55:22,240 --> 05:55:37,729
out of the house I'll play that tomorrow we'll do a bunch of we'll do at least two or three horror

1401
05:55:37,729 --> 05:55:43,310
games tomorrow because phasmophobia with Vinnie is not I don't think it's gonna be very long

1402
05:55:43,310 --> 05:55:47,810
I think we're only gonna do it for an hour or so we're just gonna get it and mess around for

1403
05:55:47,810 --> 05:55:55,840
like an hour maybe two so there'll be plenty of time to do other stuff you have you've had an

1404
05:55:55,840 --> 05:56:03,090
MRI before what was it like I've got one on Monday um it's it's really not a big deal it's you it's

1405
05:56:03,090 --> 05:56:08,509
all good it just makes a lot of noise they give you usually give you protection for your ears

1406
05:56:09,700 --> 05:56:15,250
and as long as you just it's kind of just while you're there while you're in there the way that I

1407
05:56:15,250 --> 05:56:24,130
have done MRIs before is I just kind of let the machine make a beat and then it's not like scary

1408
05:56:24,130 --> 05:56:29,250
anymore it's not weird anymore um because it goes like this it goes like

1409
05:56:33,569 --> 05:56:36,060
so while it's doing that it's just like

1410
05:56:37,200 --> 05:56:39,700
like

1411
05:56:41,680 --> 05:56:49,659
I just make it a music I make it a song and depending if you're doing it with or without

1412
05:56:49,659 --> 05:56:57,599
contrast um they give you a depends what it is but sometimes they give you an IV

1413
05:56:58,319 --> 05:57:04,540
but IVs are easy that's the honestly if you're doing it with contrast the IV is the only part

1414
05:57:04,540 --> 05:57:11,549
that's like oh wow they like you're doing an IV if you're not doing contrast then it's not a big

1415
05:57:11,549 --> 05:57:22,500
deal you'd be good I think you scared them with that voice uh thanks for watching though

1416
05:57:23,540 --> 05:57:29,540
well apparently I'm back hey yeah you thought I was over it is sorry press the wrong button

1417
05:57:29,540 --> 05:57:40,580
my voice sucks yeah but good luck you'll be good it's not so bad I'll see you tomorrow

1418
05:57:41,299 --> 05:58:22,060
2 p.m pacific take care of yourselves good night see you tomorrow
