1
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:12,539
Hi, how are you? I'm a little late. I'm a little late, but there's a reason why I'm a little late.

2
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:26,980
I'm not six hours late. I'm two and a half hours late because I needed a cable. I needed to get

3
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:32,710
the table set up a little. It's just a little. I'm just a little bit late and I don't want to

4
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:36,149
get too loud because I don't know the acoustics of this room. And I guess I said acoustics.

5
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:43,859
Well, here's my problem. I said, oh man, 2 p.m. or earlier, dude. 2 p.m. sounds good, man.

6
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:47,780
But then I was like, you know, I, me and Holly was setting up a table.

7
00:00:49,539 --> 00:01:00,820
What, what are you, what are we even doing today? Okay, there's one guy two nights ago that said

8
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:05,219
we were doing tier lists and we talked about my candy preferences, my snack preferences.

9
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:12,280
And I, there's a lot of stuff that I have in F or D, right? Don't blame it on Holly. I didn't,

10
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,159
I said we're setting the table up. It's, I, it's my fault. I should have, I should have taken

11
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:23,379
precedence and started setting the table up yesterday. It's my fault. How are you? I'm

12
00:01:23,379 --> 00:01:27,659
doing good. I'm doing good. There's going to be a system here too. So people that,

13
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:32,060
there were a lot of people concerned in the pre-stream chat. They're like, dude, um, but wait,

14
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,819
wait, wait, wait, back up, back up, back up. Don't call me a 2K Andy. It's been five seconds.

15
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:43,189
At 2K, 2,000 live viewers is a shitload. That's a fucking shitload of people.

16
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:53,769
So 2K Andy, that's huge. Anyways, and that guy for like a few minutes. All right. So listen,

17
00:01:53,769 --> 00:01:57,849
here we go. We've been doing tier lists. People in pre-stream were kind of concerned.

18
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:02,409
They're like, oh, hey, oh, so you, we got, there's a lot of, there's a lot of history.

19
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:10,090
Let's back up like two days. I said, I never have eaten a trolley before. Trolley, a trolley. I

20
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:15,270
don't know. I don't, I don't eat these fucking things. I put it in F tier and everybody freaked

21
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:20,150
out. It was like, dude, you can't put a trolley in F tier. Like, and I'm like,

22
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:24,069
they're gross. It's a gummy worm. They're stupid. And then they said, you have, you eat one on stream

23
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:32,680
and prove that you don't like it. I was like, okay, fine. But how about we eat 45 of all the

24
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:39,240
candies and snacks and breads, fruits, sodas, stuff that I've put in F tier and see if I'm full of

25
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:50,939
shit. He's absolutely insane. So I, we, there's a lot of stuff here and I, I, I, I'm not ready

26
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:59,590
to show you yet. This is going to kill him. This, I'm not, this, listen, I have a system in place.

27
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:07,610
Okay. My system is going to go as follows. I'm not going to eat every piece of candy. I'm not

28
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:13,750
going to open, for instance, the gross Almond Joy and eat the whole, I'm not going to eat the whole

29
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:21,719
bar of Almond Joy. Holly loves those. She's very upset about this. No, I'm not, I'm not going to

30
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:28,340
eat the whole bar of candy. Are you crazy? We're going to go from category to category. We're

31
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:34,500
going to start because I, there's, there's fruits here. We're going to start with fruit. I'm going

32
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,800
to eat, I'm going to take a bite, a few bites of fruit and I'm going to move it onto the side.

33
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:45,960
Something that I forgot completely. I need like a separate table to put the stuff that, oh, you

34
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:51,270
know, it doesn't matter. It can just stay here. I'm not eating the whole thing. We're going to go

35
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:57,849
category to category. We're going fruits. Okay. Take one bite. Contemplate it for a few minutes.

36
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:07,979
Place it on a new tier list. Then we're going to probably to chocolate like Almond Joy, Mounds,

37
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:12,699
Tootsie Roll. We're going to go category to category so I don't throw up. If for, look,

38
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:16,870
if for some reason I'm going to puke, it's not going to happen. I'm not going to puke.

39
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:23,660
Everybody's relaxed. Okay. Anything that I don't open is going to get donated. So if I don't get

40
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,379
to something, if I'm like, you know what, I'm not even going to fucking open that. I don't want it.

41
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:33,189
It's going to, I'm going to donate it. Anything that is opened is going to be eaten. There's going

42
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:39,699
to be like six months worth of candy here. I will eat these Milk Duds even if I don't like them.

43
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:44,600
Okay. So don't worry. All these things are shelf stable for at least like a few weeks, at least.

44
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:52,790
So yeah, like let's, let's say if I'm full of shit. Yeah. I'm not, look,

45
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:58,040
Holly likes some of this stuff. I, you know, I, I might like it too. We'll find out.

46
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:03,740
This game sucks. Can you play something else? I'm not going to puke. Everyone's so, I'm not

47
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:09,050
going to fucking throw up. Okay. Am I on camera yet? Okay. Hold on. I don't think you guys are

48
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:13,290
ready for this reveal. Yeah. I like, look, one guy made this whole fucking stream happen

49
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:17,720
and that's kind of how it works. I did this bread too. I actually probably will eat,

50
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,819
we're going to eat this bread. So don't worry. All right. Just go ahead and reveal it. Let's just,

51
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:29,910
like, let's get it over with. Yeah. Go ahead. Go ahead and show, show the table. Okay. Hi.

52
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:36,920
There's a lot here. Uh, I thought I'd like a fun, maybe like a funny joke would have been, uh,

53
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:42,500
would have been to do this. Are you ready? Like, okay. This looks like all those food eating

54
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:47,850
videos. What the fuck is he doing? You're going to get fat. Nice shirt. It's a Millennium Falcon.

55
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:53,160
Relax. All right. So already like all this shit is here. I got to do this. This is for me.

56
00:05:53,160 --> 00:06:00,500
Ready? Like, okay. Now somebody edit in like a bunch of noodles going in my mouth for the

57
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:09,769
thumbnail. Ryan's toy review. Okay. Now hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. I got, you got, you got

58
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:16,550
to edit a big mozzarella stick right here. Ready? Like, you know what I mean? You got to get the

59
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:23,100
mozzarella stick. Nice plate. What? I actually kind of don't want to eat that, but whatever.

60
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:29,319
All right. Yes. Look, I know people like don't waste food. I'm not going to waste this. These

61
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:33,560
bags of, I think it can be rolled up and sealed and they can be eaten later. I'm not going to

62
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:39,079
throw any of this shit away. I will eat it. This bag of Tootsie Rolls is going to last six years.

63
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:42,600
This is going to last six years. It's going to last a very, very long time. So don't worry.

64
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:48,649
I don't want to mess up the setup. It looks good. How long do Tootsie Rolls even last? Does anybody

65
00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:56,540
know? Happy birthday. Drink the hot sauce. All right. Let me, let me reiterate what's going on

66
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:03,639
here because people are confused. Nice window behind you. Just let this on in. They last,

67
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:08,439
they last a long time. Six years, hundreds of years. Is there an expiration date on Tootsie

68
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:18,230
Rolls? Is there actually an expiration date? I don't think there's an expiration date.

69
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:30,519
The Last Supper. Yeah. Remember when Jesus ate a bunch of fucking chili cheese Fritos with like

70
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:36,790
Joseph and Peter? Remember when they had the hot tamales and like Jesus, like Jesus, like gave a

71
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:42,199
hot tamale to Peter and he fucking, he didn't like it. He almost puked. No suit. Guys, I was already

72
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:46,120
30 minutes late and you wanted me to have a suit on. I was going to take me like another 40 minutes

73
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:51,800
to get here. So I'm sorry. There's no suit. There's no telephone. It's all right. So let's,

74
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:57,180
let's go. Let's go. Here we go. Just to show you kind of how this is going to work. Right here

75
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:01,000
would be, this should be the tier list, right? I'm going to show them for a second.

76
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:05,589
I'm going to, I'm, we're going to face my own bullshit. We're going to see. I got, if I don't

77
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:11,610
like it, it's going to F. Star Wars shirt. Yeah, I know. Suit next stream. I'm not just going to

78
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:18,339
wear a suit for fun. We got to start with the fruit because it's going to go bad if I don't

79
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:27,610
eat it like right now. So everything on that list right there. Okay. Everything on that list right

80
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:35,590
there is stuff that has been an F. All my F candies, all my F chips, all my F sodas. Hey,

81
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:39,850
well, hold on a minute. That's not F. Why is this up here? Oh, right. Cause I was going to,

82
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:45,509
I was going to do on stream. I was going to do the, the, the, the Coke versus Pepsi taste

83
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:51,639
test challenge. I mean, I already know which one I like, but do you stick around for the whole

84
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:57,639
video to find out? I'm doing that at the very fucking end. Make sure the fucking algorithm

85
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:04,009
gives me extra views. Okay. So this is a red delicious apple. They taste like shit. They smell

86
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:09,350
like shit and they kind of look like shit. I know that I don't like red delicious. Everybody. Who

87
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:13,690
does? I don't think anybody does. Are they warm? These are freezing cold. I just got them out of

88
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:19,340
the fridge. We're going to find out if I actually really hate these. I have not. Okay. Here's another

89
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:24,279
thing that really important to understand. Everything that's on this table. I don't think

90
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:30,549
I've had in like five to 10 years because I know I don't like it. Right. Why would you eat

91
00:09:30,549 --> 00:09:49,500
something you don't like? You ready? Red delicious apple first. Here we go. Oh, that was like a,

92
00:09:49,500 --> 00:10:07,370
there's a growth spot right there. Can you see the growth spot? Hold on. Let me do that again.

93
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:18,620
Okay. No, a spit bucket. Oh, apples. No, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I have to swallow it. Right.

94
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:23,659
I got to, I got to come on. I got to be a man sized sandwich. I got to swallow it. Okay. Well,

95
00:10:23,659 --> 00:10:32,710
hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Important. Actually really isn't that bad. One more. I don't, I can't

96
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:47,259
take more than like two bites. The skin sucks. The skin is like weird. These are actually really,

97
00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:50,070
they're very sweet. That's, I think that's one of the reasons why I don't like them.

98
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:55,590
Need a big bite. That, look at how big of a bite that is. What kind of mouth do you have if that's

99
00:10:55,590 --> 00:11:11,299
the one bite you take? Why do I have like a joker mouth? I, this is not F. It's not F. It's not F

100
00:11:11,299 --> 00:11:27,429
though. Fuck. This is actually kind of good. I wouldn't like one of, okay. It's not, it's not B.

101
00:11:27,429 --> 00:11:38,070
It's probably C. I think Red Delicious Apple is going to C. This table is shaking. Because

102
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:45,990
like the AC just turned on. I thought like the fucking room was shaking. Yeah. That's a C.

103
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:55,850
That's a C. It's not an F. Don't, no, no. I got like a million things to eat. All right. So that

104
00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:00,470
Red Delicious, not an F. It's a C. They're a little too sweet. I'd rather, okay, for sweet,

105
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:05,379
I'd rather just get a green apple, which is sweet and sour. It's really good. All right.

106
00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:13,820
Now we're staying in fruit. Next up, this is a cantaloupe. So this is cantaloupe. Cantaloupe

107
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:18,870
is the thing that I always avoid in a fruit cup. I always just eat around it. I say this is F.

108
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:26,570
I haven't eaten in probably five years. Shall we see if I like it? Cantaloupe. Let me get the

109
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:33,259
apple out. Actually, no. Put, put Red Delicious to D. Put it down to D. No, it's D. It's D. The skin

110
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:40,700
is still in my mouth. I'm still eating skin. D. I'm like eat, it's like eating film. Yeah. D.

111
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:50,009
Fucking absolutely D. It's still there. I've swallowed 15 times. Yeah. I swallowed like 15.

112
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:55,590
That's D. Absolutely. Red Delicious Apple D. It's still there. It's still skin in my fucking mouth.

113
00:12:55,590 --> 00:13:10,340
It's in my teeth. It's like popcorn. Cantaloupe. Here we go. Oh, juicy. Watch. Oh my god.

114
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:34,500
That's all. Somebody said this is going to make me sick. I just, I took a bite out of a fucking

115
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:49,830
apple. What do you mean? Why? Cantaloupe is, it's okay. You're not using a fork. It's a fruit,

116
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:58,759
man. What do you want me to do? It's not sticky. Yeah, it is. Okay. Cantaloupe. I said it was F.

117
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:16,279
Oh, my palate cleanser. Right. I got pickled ginger, but no, I don't think so. I think that

118
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:20,120
would, I would actually puke if I ate that right now. Yeah. I was going to do this joke where,

119
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,320
you know, when you go to sushi restaurant and you order sushi and you're supposed to use the

120
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,399
pickled ginger as a palate cleanser between each item. I was like, oh, that's kind of funny. What

121
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:32,580
if like after every bite, I cleanse my palate with some ginger. But I don't think that would,

122
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:39,820
I think I would actually throw up if I did that. So, no, we're not doing that. Okay. Cantaloupe.

123
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:51,909
Stop distracting me. See, it's juicy. It's got, it's got a good juice to it. I think it's a C.

124
00:14:51,909 --> 00:14:59,799
So here we go. Here's Cantaloupe 2, which is honeydew melon. It's just, this is, I'm going to,

125
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:02,840
it's going to be the exact same score. They're, they're the exact same thing. They taste exactly

126
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:10,629
the same. They're the same exact product. They're exactly the same. This is fucking awful. This is

127
00:15:10,629 --> 00:15:16,470
dog shit. This is literal dog shit. Yeah. This doesn't taste like anything. This tastes like

128
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:29,269
nothing. All I taste is water and like somebody sprayed Lysol in another room. This is awful.

129
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:37,620
Honeydew melon. Holy fuck. Literal F. I'm not changing my goddamn mind. It's juicy, but it

130
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:44,340
just tastes like somebody sprayed like fucking fabric softener in another room. F. F for honeydew

131
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:53,740
melon. F. This is a grapefruit. The reason why I don't like grapefruit is because it's usually

132
00:15:53,740 --> 00:16:00,100
very acidic, like way too acidic and it tastes like kind of stomach acid and it smells like

133
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:07,240
kind of good. You're wrong. I'm, I'm literally sitting here telling you that I'm eating these

134
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,919
things and giving you my opinion. I'm trying to make, I'm giving you my honest opinions. I'm

135
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:19,259
not going to put any fluff on it. Okay. Grapefruit. All these, remember everything here I put an F

136
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:33,049
at some point over the last few years. Grapefruit. Here we go. Nice Buzzfeed video. I know. But look,

137
00:16:33,049 --> 00:16:39,690
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, come on. Here we go. All right. Grapefruit. I actually don't want to bite

138
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:56,779
this. I like, I know I hate these. Let's find out. It's fucking awful. It just tastes like acid.

139
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:03,860
It's, it's, it's acid. It's just acid. Are these even, okay. Are these good for you? Are these even

140
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:14,420
good for you? Are these good for you? You need to put sugar on it. No, no, no. I'm not going to do

141
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:18,980
the thing to make the thing supposed to taste better by adding bullshit to it. This is just

142
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:24,380
the way it is. What you, okay. Oh dude, take the red delicious apple and put caramel all over it.

143
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:32,710
And then you'll like it. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. These are F. This is bad. This stays in F. Where

144
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:41,140
it belongs. Yeah. I know. You cut the thing in half and you like shake fucking 50 grams of sugar

145
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:45,619
all over the thing. So it gets sapped in and seeps into the actual fruit and then you can eat it.

146
00:17:45,619 --> 00:17:52,940
No, no, no. Oh yeah. Are you guys the same people that put sugar on your cornflakes? When you order,

147
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:57,339
when you order cornflakes, do you put the cornflakes, which goes up in front of your table

148
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:03,930
and you put sugar all over it? It's the same exact thing. It's an animal style grapefruit.

149
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:10,039
It's how you're supposed to eat it. I'm just telling you right now, the fruit by itself is enough.

150
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:15,559
If you add sugar to something, a shitload of sugar, it's like, yeah, it's probably going to be better.

151
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:20,009
I mean, I could literally probably open up the Fun Dip and like put it on there. And then it's

152
00:18:20,009 --> 00:18:29,579
like the same thing. God, Fun Dip sucks. So if somebody already has a thumbnail. Oh, I want to

153
00:18:29,579 --> 00:18:55,750
see. I'm coming. That's pretty good. That's pretty good. Okay. Fruits are done. I was wrong about

154
00:18:55,750 --> 00:19:03,769
cantaloupe. Red Delicious said, I don't know if they're F. They're okay. All right. In the same

155
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:12,339
realm, we're going to go to, these are cold. We're going to do these now. So we're going to do sodas.

156
00:19:13,529 --> 00:19:23,849
This is Diet Mountain Dew, which is wrong. Mountain Dew is an F for me. So Diet Mountain

157
00:19:23,849 --> 00:19:30,089
Dew is probably like not allowed to even be scored. Diet Mountain Dew is probably fucking

158
00:19:30,089 --> 00:19:39,420
terrible. It's disgusting. I don't, it sucks. Diet. Why would you make Diet Mountain Dew? Why?

159
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:45,059
What's the point of making a Diet Mountain Dew? Listen to that. Hold on. This is for the video.

160
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:58,119
This is for the fucking like eating, like eating channel video. Okay. It smells. How does it smell?

161
00:19:58,119 --> 00:20:23,819
Diet Mountain Dew. You ready? Let's give you the honest opinion. She said you. You guys don't

162
00:20:23,819 --> 00:20:31,480
understand. So I can hear her in like the other room or if she's like working on something

163
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:37,210
somewhere else in like, in the house, I will hear, I will do something weird and I'll hear, oh,

164
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:48,410
I can hear it from the other room. Oh, this is very bad. It's very bad. Do I think this is better

165
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:57,299
than actual Mountain Dew? Weirdly, yes, I do. Okay. Mountain Dew is way too sugary and tastes way,

166
00:20:57,299 --> 00:21:03,460
it's just like pure sugar. So for some reason, this is better than Mountain Dew. What's in it?

167
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:13,940
Wait, hold on. Aspartame. I'm going to go ahead and seal that. We're going to go ahead and seal

168
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:20,809
that and we're going to just go ahead and seal that. Does all Diet Soda have aspartame in it?

169
00:21:20,809 --> 00:21:31,079
Put the cap on it. I am. Somebody will drink this. Maybe not. Somebody will drink this.

170
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:35,259
Diet Mountain Dew? Dog shit. It's fucking awful. It's literally F, but it's better than regular

171
00:21:35,259 --> 00:21:38,940
Mountain Dew. I'm sorry. I just don't like Mountain Dew. I know people love Mountain Dew. Oh,

172
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:43,099
Mountain Dew is so good. I don't like it. I think it's bad. Here's Squirt. Did I put this in F or

173
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:56,460
I never tried this? Oh, it's Grapefruit Soda. I don't want it. Hold on. I got a really funny

174
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:06,259
joke coming up. Stay tuned. This is Squirt. There you go. Squirt. I guess I never had this.

175
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:27,589
Why did I put it in F? Oh, that's nice. Oh, okay. I drink it. I've had Fresca before. Oh,

176
00:22:27,589 --> 00:22:34,809
did we put Mountain Dew in F? Okay, just making sure. Squirt. I've had Fresca. Fresca's a little

177
00:22:34,809 --> 00:22:45,210
too harsh somehow. This is pretty smooth. I don't know why I just feel like I was being held hostage.

178
00:22:49,529 --> 00:22:52,569
I don't know why. I just like looked up. There's like, I don't know. It's like,

179
00:22:52,569 --> 00:22:59,740
why am I being held hostage right now? Like, what is happening? He loves it. I actually,

180
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:14,660
it's pretty good. All right, one more sip and then I'll put it away. I think this is a solid B.

181
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:27,619
I think Squirt's a solid B. It's not, I can tell if I'm gonna start like, it's a lot, it's bubbly.

182
00:23:27,619 --> 00:23:35,480
He's breaking from the simulation. I think this is a B. I would drink this again and I will because

183
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:40,180
it's gonna go in the fridge and I'm gonna drink it later. Ah, Squirt's a B. That's, I'm actually

184
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:45,930
very surprised. It's lighter than Fresca somehow. I can't hide. I literally can't hide. Yes, I can.

185
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:58,869
Okay. I couldn't, there's literally nothing I could do to stop that. I could not stop that.

186
00:23:58,869 --> 00:24:04,460
It was impossible. It was literally impossible. Should I make it lower grade? No, should I make

187
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:07,660
it a lower grade because like, holy shit, that was like fucking violent. I couldn't even,

188
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:25,609
I couldn't stop that. Oh, you can mute. That's right. Imagine if I just mute down here. Dude,

189
00:24:25,609 --> 00:24:31,210
I would never be able to like, okay, we've talked a lot of shit about like, like, okay, sponsorships,

190
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:34,329
right? Like, I'm gonna start doing sponsors. Maybe you've seen one. Maybe you see another

191
00:24:34,329 --> 00:24:42,299
at some point, right? Like if I were to fucking just puke down here, this would never be allowed

192
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:45,980
on my stream ever. Even if like, okay, yeah, you've said some things that you were like,

193
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:50,140
you were just joking around. I drank a squirt and I puked down my shirt, right? That would be

194
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:54,980
impossible to, I couldn't hide that. You guys, the second, it would have been possible. I would,

195
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:59,819
it would be possible. Whatever. It's a B. I think it's a high B. All right, sodas. We still, oh,

196
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:11,750
no, I'm okay. I should be fine. This is A&W cream soda, which is only good when there's like

197
00:25:13,829 --> 00:25:22,900
a little bit of ice cream in it. I really don't like this at all. The bubbles are like still

198
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:27,980
there. I'm all right. What if I just fucking, dude, if I puke and like whatever, if I have like a

199
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:34,660
soda puke, I will live forever, okay? If I take, if I took a big chunk of soda and like the bubbles

200
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:39,220
come up and I puke, I live forever. I will live forever. Like that'll be shared for like the next

201
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:42,819
hundred years. I will literally be the, I'll be the guy that like puked on his stream like with bubble

202
00:25:42,819 --> 00:25:46,740
pukes and I will live forever. I will never die. It'll be impossible for me. I'll live forever.

203
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:51,609
Okay, oh, this is the joke I was gonna make. No, that's disgusting. Why would I make that joke?

204
00:25:51,609 --> 00:25:55,829
I was gonna make it like a fart thing where I was gonna be like, you know what I mean? Like

205
00:25:56,809 --> 00:26:05,799
you know what I'm saying? Do you guys want music? How you guys feel? You guys want some,

206
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:16,150
want some tunes in the background? Cream soda smells amazing, but I don't like how it tastes.

207
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:23,779
No music? No, no music. Okay, all right. You guys can put your own soundtrack in the background if

208
00:26:23,779 --> 00:26:33,579
you want. Okay, so here we go. This is A&W cream soda. I actually am a huge fan of A&W root beer,

209
00:26:33,579 --> 00:26:39,079
but I'm not a big fan of cream soda. Cream soda is, you take one sip and yeah, that's enough.

210
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:42,200
You've had enough, which I'm sure it's going to happen here because after the first sip,

211
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:49,500
you get like immune to the flavor. Let's see if it happens. One sip, delicious, kind of sugary,

212
00:26:49,500 --> 00:27:04,380
way too much, a little too much. Second, third sip, I'm immune to the flavor. What the fuck?

213
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:22,950
Oh my God. Huh? Oh my God. There's 77, 76 grams of sugar in this bottle. Wait, no, yeah. 76 grams

214
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:38,220
of sugar? I thought it was like 40. What's in a Coke? 60, 65. God damn, that's a lot of sugar.

215
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:44,569
Okay, so again, like my issue with cream soda is I can tell you, I knew it was going to be bad.

216
00:27:44,569 --> 00:27:53,430
It's like syrupy. It's thicker than a regular soda. It's thick. Yeah, and now I'm immune to

217
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:59,799
the flavor. I don't, I taste like kind of sweetness and bubbles. The cream soda flavor doesn't exist.

218
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:17,619
This goes good on ice cream. This goes good on ice cream, I think. Is it creamy? I mean,

219
00:28:17,619 --> 00:28:21,859
I think like this sitting at the bottom of vanilla ice cream, like just like in a little pool would

220
00:28:21,859 --> 00:28:28,970
be kind of pretty good. Are they going to float? 76 grams of sugar. These are all so sugary. What

221
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:41,289
is the lowest one? Oh, squirt based. 63. What about Pepsi? 69, 65. Squirt's got the lowest sugar so far.

222
00:28:41,289 --> 00:28:49,769
Of course it does, based. All right, that's cream soda. It's uh, it's F. It just is. It's just,

223
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:59,859
you can't enjoy, I can't enjoy it. I actually, I just really can't enjoy that. Okay, if I wasn't

224
00:28:59,859 --> 00:29:09,849
drinking it, if it was used as a sauce, sure. Okay, bubbles are coming up. Nice, nice based.

225
00:29:09,849 --> 00:29:16,220
Is it Bussin? No, it's not. My root beer. It's just, yeah, it's kind of just shitty root beer.

226
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:22,119
And again, let me be very clear. I love A&W root beer. I think it's fantastic. It's probably the

227
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:30,549
best. Mug beats it by a lot, I think, but I think it's still incredibly good based on what?

228
00:29:30,549 --> 00:29:39,109
Epo. What about squirt over cream? Well, I mean, cream, cream soda's F. This is B. All right,

229
00:29:39,109 --> 00:29:47,720
it's time to do... No, no, this is good. I'm fine. I mean, guys, people, here's the thing.

230
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:52,779
A lot of people are concerned about this stream, but I will tell you right now, I have been high

231
00:29:52,779 --> 00:29:58,490
and eaten like all this shit before. Guys, I've been high and eaten an entire tub of Ben and

232
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:04,619
Jerry's ice cream. I think I'm going to be okay. Like I've eaten like Cheez-Its, Ben and Jerry's

233
00:30:04,619 --> 00:30:11,210
ice cream, um, like banana cream pie in the same night with Cheez-Its and shit. So like,

234
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:15,529
I think I'd be fine, especially if I don't do that much. I know I don't like Diet Coke,

235
00:30:15,529 --> 00:30:23,750
but I put it in F so I have to re-remember why. I actually would, I'll use that as a sauce. So,

236
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:33,880
he's high right now. Does your doctor know about this? You want to call my doctor and say,

237
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:39,079
hey, hey, hey, hey, doctor, yeah, I'm just very concerned. I wanted to call you about a few

238
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:44,539
things. Oh, what is it? What can I help you with? I'm eating Almond Joys and I'm eating a bunch of

239
00:30:44,539 --> 00:30:49,259
candy today. I'm eating a Tootsie Roll. I'm eating one bite of an Almond Joy and taking a sip of

240
00:30:49,259 --> 00:31:02,019
cream soda. Am I going to be all right? He's going to hang up on me. This is Diet Coke. Don't blow

241
00:31:02,019 --> 00:31:18,099
up. Oh, okay. Dude, you're going to have to go to the emergency room. No, I'm fine. Guys, do you

242
00:31:18,099 --> 00:31:24,490
understand that there are, there are people that like drink like five of these in a day? All of,

243
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:31,000
okay, all the concerned Andes in here. How many fucking monsters did you have today? How many

244
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:37,690
monsters did you have today? How many, how many, how many of those have you had today? Interesting.

245
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:46,819
Don't take a sip out of cream soda, Jeremy, but like, oh yeah, monster, extra fire, whatever the

246
00:31:46,819 --> 00:31:54,059
fuck it is. Zero, zero, zero, zero to my entire life. All right, well, whatever. You understand

247
00:31:54,059 --> 00:32:06,119
this is Coke and it's F. This is Diet Coke. Whoa, be careful. Yeah, it's F. It sucks. Not changing

248
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:10,599
my opinion on Diet Coke. Diet Coke just tastes like regular Coke that went through like a

249
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:27,099
britter water filter. It's, it's, it's, it's, no, no, I don't think so. I wouldn't want to drink a

250
00:32:27,099 --> 00:32:31,819
whole one of these. You know what I mean? I don't, I don't want to drink a whole one of these.

251
00:32:31,819 --> 00:32:45,140
People drink a shitload of this. It just like sucks. Zero calories. How many calories are in

252
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:58,170
just a regular Coke? 240. This sucks. That's what the mini cans are for. Yeah, dude. Okay.

253
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:04,500
People, let me tell you something. The mini cans and the mini little ones. Oh, that's good. That's

254
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:07,859
good shit. You should, that's fine. Drink one of those. You can make those go a long way. You know

255
00:33:07,859 --> 00:33:14,200
how? I'm going to give you a tip here. Here's a tip. Get a big cup like this and fill the fucking

256
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:24,150
thing with ice. I'm not going to puke. No, I'm not going to puke. It's literally just bubbles.

257
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:30,390
Every time I drink soda, I get like fucking gassy. Okay. So don't everybody freak out.

258
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:36,660
You get, you get a big cup like this and you fill the fucking thing with ice. I'm talking to the

259
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:41,930
brim. When you pour in half of that goddamn can, it's going to fill the whole thing and you can

260
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:46,490
enjoy it for like an hour if you want to. Right? You don't have to drink that much soda. Fill ice

261
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:50,490
and dilute it. It's fine. A little bit of dilution is fine. You know, it's not going to make you sick.

262
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:57,640
Why would it make you sick? Get a bucket. I'm not, I don't need a bucket. All right. The last thing

263
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:04,900
I'm going to do is I'm going to, this has nothing to do with the tier list. Put this over here.

264
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:13,380
Yeah, it's up. We're going to do the Coke versus Pepsi blind taste test. Actually,

265
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:19,769
I think I might need you to come in here. I, I, I'll know. I'll know. Right. Okay. Hold on.

266
00:34:19,769 --> 00:34:30,550
Let's open them both. So I don't want to, I don't want any bias here. This is the Coke. Oh,

267
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:34,389
the shape, right? Yeah. The different shapes. Ah, it should be fine. I'll just grab it weirdly.

268
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:46,780
Okay. This, this is Pepsi. This is Coke. Yeah. I'm going to drink pretty much all this stuff.

269
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:51,260
Okay. So, um, I'm going to, I'm going to hand, I'm going to, actually here. Probably easier

270
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:54,360
if you're just ready. So I'm going to close my eyes and I don't want to know which one you're

271
00:34:54,360 --> 00:35:12,219
handing me. It could be either one and just stick it in the cup holder. Oh, I know that taste. That

272
00:35:12,219 --> 00:35:29,539
is the classic, classic Coke taste. Okay. Take it. I can tell when it's Coke because it hurts.

273
00:35:29,539 --> 00:35:45,690
Got it? Why does this taste like raspberry? This is raspberry. Is this raspberry flavor?

274
00:35:48,260 --> 00:36:02,250
What? I don't like that one. I'm done with that one. Give me, let me see the other one, please.

275
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:15,269
Yeah. Let me do the other one one more time. This is definitely Coke. Yeah. Of course it is.

276
00:36:15,269 --> 00:36:20,780
Of course it is. This is the classic Coke flavor. The other one was raspberry. What is it?

277
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:29,079
Yeah. That Pepsi is way worse than Coke. Coke is way better. Okay. Well, first of all,

278
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:34,969
like this like tastes like it has other flavors in it. Coke kind of hurts when you,

279
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:40,579
when you drink Coke, it has that kind of like, it's like a bite, which I like way more than Pepsi.

280
00:36:40,579 --> 00:36:53,179
Let me just do the, not that I can see it. Let me see. This tastes almost like vanilla,

281
00:36:53,179 --> 00:37:04,969
like it tastes like there's something else in it. Citric acid. Is there citric acid in Coke?

282
00:37:04,969 --> 00:37:12,949
Bro, no, there's not. No, that's the difference. It's citric acid. That's the difference.

283
00:37:13,909 --> 00:37:20,980
There's citric acid in Pepsi and this, this, this phosphoric acid in Coke. That's why it tastes

284
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:28,250
like kind of like, it's like a like fruity. Okay. Coke's way better. Coke is like A.

285
00:37:29,659 --> 00:37:35,829
Pepsi is like, it's not bad. I, I, I, did I put it in F? I gotta hide for a second because I'm gonna

286
00:37:35,829 --> 00:37:43,110
burp. Everybody probably thought I was about to puke. Everybody's probably like, oh shit,

287
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:46,949
he's puking. No, I just wanted to hide because I didn't want to burp into the fucking microphone.

288
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:55,699
Pepsi is a C minus. It's not F. It's not fair to call it F. Coke is way better.

289
00:37:56,340 --> 00:38:03,829
I gotta go down to like fucking puke. All right. There's your sodas. The one that surprised me is

290
00:38:03,829 --> 00:38:10,650
probably squirt. The first time I've probably ever had it. I move away from the mic to put the Coke

291
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:17,800
cap on. Yeah, I got it. These all go in the fridge. I will absolutely drink all the Pepsi. I'll drink

292
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:26,199
all the Coke. I'll, this will be used as a sauce. I'll drink all this. I'll, I'll drink all that.

293
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:34,980
I'll have to. Okay. Coke is A. Pepsi is C. That's my opinion. I know you probably love Pepsi,

294
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:38,179
but it tastes, it's got fruits in it somehow. It tastes like it's got fruits in it. So that's it.

295
00:38:38,739 --> 00:38:45,639
What's in here? Oh, my green tea powder. Perfect. All right. There's your soda. There's your fruit.

296
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:50,739
We're gonna move on. Let's stay in the sugar realm. Why not? Let's move to chocolate.

297
00:38:53,500 --> 00:39:01,579
This is Almond Joy. These are both, to me, these are both, old people eat these. This is like,

298
00:39:01,579 --> 00:39:07,099
I imagine an old guy sitting just kind of in a rocking chair. Just like, they're like,

299
00:39:07,099 --> 00:39:11,420
these are like 19, like 20 or something. These are all old and old people eat these and I don't

300
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:16,340
like them. And they're made by this, look, you can tell that the same, the same game company made

301
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:25,130
these. This is like an asset flip. It's a, it's a unity flip. It's an asset flip. All right. This

302
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:32,809
is Almond Joy. I'm only going to take like one bite of this. Oh, it's like a little sectioned

303
00:39:32,809 --> 00:39:42,360
off here. Okay. So this is what it looks like. This is what an Almond Joy is. I, I don't think

304
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:49,190
I've even ever opened this. Have I ever eaten, I feel like I've eaten this and hated it.

305
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:57,019
Why, but why are they, why is there a coconut on it? It's coconut? All right. Here we go. Almond

306
00:39:57,019 --> 00:40:15,960
Joy. Almond Joy, everybody. Here we go. It's very mushy in the middle. Very mushy. Do you want one?

307
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:34,380
She's like, you want the other half of this? Wait, it's definitely not F. It's too, it's like too,

308
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:40,409
it's like too mushy. There's like too much fiber in the middle. I know, but coconut is like,

309
00:40:41,929 --> 00:40:50,440
I like coconut water and coconut milk. Here, take that. Actually, the more that it, the more

310
00:40:50,440 --> 00:41:03,190
that I'm sitting here, I kind of hate it, but I want another one. Hold on. I'm very texture-based.

311
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:19,349
Same reason why the apple Red Delicious, it's like the skin. If I have to sit there and like chew

312
00:41:19,349 --> 00:41:26,199
your product for more than like two or three straight minutes, I usually don't, because now,

313
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:31,559
here's the problem. Okay. Well, gross. Here we go. Here's the problem. Problem. Problem alert.

314
00:41:32,739 --> 00:41:40,650
All the chocolate is gone. All the almond is gone. The only thing that's left is fibers of coconut,

315
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:57,269
just mushed together in my mouth. Still there. Nope. Nope. Sorry. I would treat this the same

316
00:41:57,269 --> 00:42:04,250
way that I usually treat milk dogs, which by the way, I thought I just dumped them. Coming up soon.

317
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,719
I make sure you stay to the end of the video for me to tell you which one I like more.

318
00:42:10,519 --> 00:42:23,019
I'm still showing it. Still showing it. Still there. Oh, it's slowing. It's getting slowly

319
00:42:23,019 --> 00:42:32,949
down past D. It's just D. It's D. I'm sorry. I'm still showing the fucking coconut fibers.

320
00:42:32,949 --> 00:42:39,699
I'm enjoying. Honey, I'm sorry. This is D. Oh, it's still there. I was, I don't want to eat this.

321
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:58,230
I'm trying to swallow it. I want someone to count how many times I just had chewed that from when

322
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:03,369
it went in. That first, okay, when I bit it and it was like the textural, like the mush of the

323
00:43:03,369 --> 00:43:09,210
coconut, the fibers, the chocolate, the almonds, that was a B. That bite was a B. That was a B plus.

324
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:15,820
Then the same problem I have with the fucking red delicious apple, it stays in your mouth forever

325
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:22,360
and you just chew up a bunch of fucking paper. That's what it's, it is good value. If you like

326
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:30,440
chewing coconut, that was a B plus initial reaction. And then, and then like a D. So I think,

327
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:44,840
I don't think it's F. F is kind of unfair. He's muted. No, I'm not. Holly is based. Holly,

328
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:54,380
you should get him. It's a skill issue. It's not like Apex. What are you talking about?

329
00:43:56,150 --> 00:44:01,110
The initial bite was a B. The rest of it was like a D minus. So therefore it has to go into C minus.

330
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:05,739
I'll be fair to it. I will be fair to it. It's a C minus. I'm not going to go to the store and buy

331
00:44:05,739 --> 00:44:11,380
a C minus though. If somebody presented me with an almond joy, I'd go, oh, thanks. In my brain,

332
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:16,579
I'd secretly be going, fuck that guy. But I'd be like, thanks. And I would eat it and it'd be all

333
00:44:16,579 --> 00:44:22,579
right. Almond joy, C minus. It's not an F. Let's stay in the same category. There's mounds now.

334
00:44:22,579 --> 00:44:28,780
Oh, more coconut from the same asset flip. So what's the difference? What's the difference

335
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:34,469
between mounds and coconut? Mounds and almond joy. That's the only difference. It might be

336
00:44:34,469 --> 00:44:49,960
dark chocolate. Oh wait, the only difference is there's just no almonds in this. What? Oh,

337
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:54,360
it is. It really, it just is that. But I liked the almonds in this. This is going to be F.

338
00:44:54,920 --> 00:45:02,179
All right. This is, this is mounds. Mounds again. It's dark chocolate with no almonds. Oh,

339
00:45:02,179 --> 00:45:18,860
I don't really like dark chocolate and I didn't like the mushy coconut. Here we go. Okay. You know

340
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:26,070
those like chocolate shops? You go in and they have like the, oh, pick like 10, pick a box of 10.

341
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:29,340
And they have like the little things where it's like, oh, this one's filled with raspberry goo.

342
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:38,599
This one has like fucking peach schnapps in it. That just reminds me of one of those. Hold on.

343
00:45:38,599 --> 00:45:53,849
This is better. Yeah, it's better. The dark chocolate goes with the coconut way better than

344
00:45:53,849 --> 00:46:08,860
the yellow one. And I'm not even a dark chocolate fan. Is he wearing pants? Of course not. These

345
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:22,980
were both an F. What almond joy a D? Oh, it's already there. Again, same problem. Alert. Red

346
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:33,369
alert. Okay. If they just, if it was like coconut flavored juice in the middle, these would be like

347
00:46:33,369 --> 00:46:47,179
B. If this was like coconut, like smooth coconut flavored, like nougat, this would be like an A.

348
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:53,769
Just swallow it. Dude, I can't. You have fucking George Washington teeth. That's why I don't,

349
00:46:53,769 --> 00:47:05,940
man. It's just, it's coconut. Coconut sucks. Get better at chewing. No, I'm, I'm gonna,

350
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:14,469
it's a man sized sandwich here. That first bite was better than this first bite. I put that in D.

351
00:47:14,469 --> 00:47:21,780
This is going to C. It's not an F. It's like, it's like a C is C. I was about to take another bite.

352
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:29,099
Shouldn't that prove something? Chew it less. Okay. How many times do you want me to chew this?

353
00:47:29,099 --> 00:47:38,550
What, what are they saying? Like how many times should I chew this before swallowing it?

354
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:50,969
120. No, all the chew Andes in chat here. How long should I chew this for? 60 times?

355
00:47:50,969 --> 00:47:56,619
Enough so you can swallow it. 30 times. 30, 30, 30. I'm going to chew this. I'm seeing a lot of like

356
00:47:56,619 --> 00:48:36,329
20, 30. I'll chew it 30. 27, 20. We'll go for 30. Okay. I can't. I fucking can't. I can't. It's too

357
00:48:36,329 --> 00:48:46,699
much. This hurts to watch. Why? Because I don't like your favorite shitty candy. It's not shitty.

358
00:48:46,699 --> 00:48:50,619
I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. It's not dentures. I don't have a baby mouth. It eat

359
00:48:50,619 --> 00:48:57,289
coconut, dude. Coconut is fibrous. Coconut. Yeah, it is for old people. That's what I'm talking

360
00:48:57,289 --> 00:49:16,860
about. Cause old people just sit there and they go. Yeah, that's why it's for old people. Cause they

361
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:22,360
chew the fuck out of it. All right. It's a, it's a C. And that's all I have to say. And I'm not

362
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:26,039
saying anymore. And you won't be able to get me to change my opinion. Okay. Chocolate. What else

363
00:49:26,039 --> 00:49:38,969
we got? Tootsie rolls. Why not? Yeah, they're right here. This dude's so out of touch. Why?

364
00:49:38,969 --> 00:49:51,239
Cause I'm now, I'm going to be fishing coconut out of my gums for the next hour. Tootsie rolls

365
00:49:51,239 --> 00:49:58,730
were, were they F or D? I think they were low D or high F. Just a, see nothing here. Not just

366
00:49:58,730 --> 00:50:06,250
no strings or anything. See, there's nothing here. See? Tootsie roll. Just a regular, just generic

367
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:20,039
Tootsie roll. Why did you buy so many? Do you know how hard it is to buy one of these? You don't

368
00:50:20,039 --> 00:50:28,820
let us tell them. You have to buy a bag that's either this or 30 pounds. They don't make little

369
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:45,159
Tootsie rolls. Let me get the coconut in my mouth. This is not man-sized. It doesn't matter. Okay.

370
00:50:45,159 --> 00:50:50,949
Coconut's gone. Remember, mouthfeel is very important. I'm a very texture-based person.

371
00:50:50,949 --> 00:51:25,079
It's fun. It's fun to do. Doesn't taste very good. You know why I don't like Tootsie rolls?

372
00:51:25,079 --> 00:51:40,340
We're doing it out right now. It tastes more like candy than it does chocolate. You know what? Oh,

373
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:45,940
the flavor. Yeah. I was told that I did this wrong because there's like the flavored Tootsie rolls

374
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:54,630
are better. Not the default ones. This tastes, this doesn't taste like chocolate to me. It tastes

375
00:51:54,630 --> 00:52:02,440
less like chocolate. Like this is not a chocolate to me. It's just like a candy. This, this was a

376
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:08,900
chocolate. This is chocolate flavored candy. And that doesn't make any sense. So that's why I kind

377
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:23,929
of don't like it. Midgis? What is a midgi? Is this like, like from what countries did I get these

378
00:52:23,929 --> 00:52:39,019
from? Midgi? Is that like, is that like Finnish? Is that Finnish for like middle? Midgi. What is that?

379
00:52:39,179 --> 00:52:54,090
It's mid. It's mid. Is it, what is that? Like is it a different language? Is it Australian?

380
00:52:56,199 --> 00:53:10,920
Australian is English. It's mid grade. Mid grade. It's not mid. All right. I, we are,

381
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:18,980
we are, don't say it's mid grade. I didn't say that. I didn't say that. Tootsie roll,

382
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:22,179
Tootsie roll, if you're watching the stream right now, I didn't say mid grade. I,

383
00:53:22,179 --> 00:53:33,690
hold on. They said that. I didn't say it. It's F. I said it was F, but they're saying mid grade,

384
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:38,409
which is not what I said. I said it's F. That means that I don't like them very much.

385
00:53:38,409 --> 00:53:50,219
That means I actually don't like them. I see the appeal though. I just, I just wouldn't want,

386
00:53:50,219 --> 00:53:59,739
I just, okay. Look, if they would, these are going to go like this. Yeah. Okay. So this is what's

387
00:53:59,739 --> 00:54:04,869
going to happen to the Tootsie Rolls. They're going to roll up like this. They're going to go

388
00:54:04,869 --> 00:54:13,559
into a box and they're going to sit in a closet forever. They don't, they expire in 2024. I'm

389
00:54:13,559 --> 00:54:18,539
going to go into the closet sometimes. I'm going to go into the pantry sometimes and I'm going to

390
00:54:19,099 --> 00:54:26,679
look at it a year from now and go, oh yeah, sure. I'll eat one. I'll eat one of these,

391
00:54:26,679 --> 00:54:32,889
maybe two of these in the next year. Trick or treaters. That's no, no trick or

392
00:54:32,889 --> 00:54:38,300
treaters don't want little Tootsie Rolls. The trick or treaters want king size Reese's. That's

393
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:46,139
what they want. All right. This Tootsie Rolls, they're F. They will be probably eaten eventually.

394
00:54:46,139 --> 00:54:52,219
No trick or treater wants a Tootsie Roll. Come on. Oh, stay tuned to the end of the video.

395
00:54:52,219 --> 00:55:00,179
All right. What else? We have a couple of snow caps. I know that we've got somebody here that's

396
00:55:00,179 --> 00:55:09,380
a big fan of snow caps. I just remember these being like too crunchy. I remember the, I hate

397
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:17,349
these. I'm glad I'm solidifying, I'm solidifying a lot of opinions here. The packaging is cool.

398
00:55:17,349 --> 00:55:33,880
Here we go. Snow cap. The chocolate's kind of, I don't like the chocolate very much.

399
00:55:41,539 --> 00:55:51,880
I'll probably eat this whole box when I get high next time. They're weird, they're like

400
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:57,780
weirdly good, but in a way that I don't want to eat them right now. The texture is good.

401
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:04,420
The chocolate's, I don't like the chocolate very much though. This is a flyover state candy.

402
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:26,809
They're just chocolate chips covered in, they're just, yeah, they're just chocolate chips covered

403
00:56:26,809 --> 00:56:35,510
in like a, these weird like, I don't want to say it because it's like mean. I don't want to say

404
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:43,079
it because it's mean if I say it. It looks like it's, you know what I'm going to say, right?

405
00:56:43,079 --> 00:56:55,800
It looks like chocolate chips covered in, no. You want some? Yeah, take whatever you want. Oh,

406
00:56:55,800 --> 00:57:01,219
you want some snow caps? Oh, my girl loves snow caps. No, I don't know what they taste like. Oh,

407
00:57:01,219 --> 00:57:07,989
you don't know what they taste like? Here you go. All right, we need your honest opinion.

408
00:57:07,989 --> 00:57:19,690
Okay, here, eat another one on camera. These people, yeah, you could have eaten anything.

409
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:36,889
You could have just eaten anything. Eww. I think it's like, I like the, I like the crunchy texture

410
00:57:36,889 --> 00:57:43,050
is good, right? I wouldn't buy it. This is movie theater candy. You, but you get this in the movie

411
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:47,800
theater and you watch a movie and you eat like half of, you don't, wait, isn't there, hold on a

412
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:53,210
second. Don't people sprinkle this into popcorn? That's like the whole thing. You sprinkle this

413
00:57:53,210 --> 00:58:06,409
into popcorn, right? I could understand that actually. These aren't F. These don't belong in

414
00:58:06,409 --> 00:58:09,849
F. They're just like, all right, okay, stop, I gotta stop eating them. I've eaten too many.

415
00:58:09,849 --> 00:58:28,469
The fact that I keep eating them. Damn, I think, hold on. I actually kind of like these. How tall

416
00:58:28,469 --> 00:58:41,500
is Holly? Six, six, two, six, three. Fuck, these are not F. I gotta stop eating them. I know those

417
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:46,710
are good. It took me a minute to understand. It took me, it took me like, I was gonna, I was

418
00:58:46,710 --> 00:58:51,619
gonna make fun of them. I can make fun of them now, right? Because like, I like it. I like them. So

419
00:58:51,619 --> 00:58:58,420
like that, these are B. Snowcaps are B, but they look like chocolate with mold on it. They look

420
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:02,099
like chocolate with like mold all over it. I can say that because like I, they're telling you I

421
00:59:02,099 --> 00:59:15,059
enjoy them, but they have, they have an interesting look. Where does it go? Below squirt, B. Are you

422
00:59:15,059 --> 00:59:26,940
standing right now? Yeah, those are B. Those are, those are very good. Those are very good.

423
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:32,860
I want to, you know, get, I gotta get those away from me. I think I'm going to eat another one.

424
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:40,900
Take those, take those. I think I'm going to go for another couple of those. Oh, did you,

425
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:48,179
did they open? It's like they all dump up. How about that red delicious apple?

426
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:58,860
What the fuck, man? Why do apples do this? Why do apples do this? This is like,

427
01:00:00,599 --> 01:00:06,340
no, this is not from my mouth. Apples are so unappetizing, aren't they? All right,

428
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:08,820
that's good. That's fine. I just don't want that to be on camera because I don't want you guys to

429
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:13,050
look, you guys are going to be like grossed out. All right, what else we got? Snowcaps. They were

430
01:00:13,050 --> 01:00:21,369
F. They were F. Another B. So opinions can change, right? Whopper time. So I have a Whopper. Whoppers

431
01:00:21,369 --> 01:00:24,650
and Milk Duds are in the same category for me. And then these chocolate chip cookie dough bites

432
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:31,909
are going to be gross. Whoppers. Another old person candy. Another candy you'd eat if you're

433
01:00:31,909 --> 01:00:39,619
over the age of like 50. Or if you go to the movie theater and you really just kind of don't

434
01:00:39,619 --> 01:00:44,219
know what to order. And there's like 10 people in line behind you. So you just go,

435
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:53,429
Whoppers, I guess. And then you go, fuck, this is an easy F. I mean, they are. They were F for me

436
01:00:53,429 --> 01:01:04,460
before. Here we go. Whoppers. It's like a malt, malted kind of chocolate ball, right? Let's see.

437
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:13,400
This says be an original. I feel like I'm kind of an original. They've already, look, they're

438
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:33,659
already speaking to me. They think I'm original. They think they said it. Like sandy. Kind of sandy.

439
01:01:33,659 --> 01:01:51,000
Although it dissipates very, very, very quickly. Very. Suck on it first. Let it melt. Hold on.

440
01:01:51,559 --> 01:02:21,380
Hold on. Oh, wow. That was a good, that was a good tip. Grandpa's passed out with like,

441
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:47,480
with his mouth? Uh, no. You're turning green. Jesus. Jesus. Now the sandy part is soft.

442
01:02:47,480 --> 01:03:15,530
Geez. Oh, one more. One more, one more, one more. That's it. One more. Yeah, these are good. I was

443
01:03:15,530 --> 01:03:22,550
eating them wrong the whole time, my whole life. I was eating these wrong my entire life. I was

444
01:03:22,550 --> 01:03:30,659
just eating them and crunching them and going, ugh. You gotta let the flavors happen. You have to let

445
01:03:30,659 --> 01:03:39,099
the flavors happen. It's a multi-layered candy. See, there's like this nice, it's a nice, it's

446
01:03:39,099 --> 01:03:44,170
actually a pretty nice like smooth chocolate on the outside. The inside I don't like. But if you let

447
01:03:44,170 --> 01:03:57,429
sit for a minute. Jesus, these are good. I'm very conflicted right now because these are like really

448
01:03:57,429 --> 01:04:21,639
good. But are they though? They're kind of a little too buttery at the end. How do I really

449
01:04:21,639 --> 01:04:32,440
feel? He's a C. He went from F to C. There's a little too buttery at the end. Oh, it's over Cantaloupe

450
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:41,300
for sure. Um, it's over Pepsi for sure. Pepsi is above Cantaloupe without a doubt. Wait a minute.

451
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:50,019
No, it's not. Cantaloupe is way above Pepsi. Yeah. Stop nitpicking. I mean, this whole stream is I'm

452
01:04:50,019 --> 01:04:59,960
nitpicking my shitty opinions on my F tier candies. Watch out. Yeah, I'm gonna make sure I don't drop

453
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:06,579
any of this. Which I haven't, so that's good. Put that over here. All right, so we have a little,

454
01:05:06,579 --> 01:05:12,250
we have only a couple more chocolates left. Very cool. I'm not looking forward to this because I

455
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:16,090
don't like cashews. I know I don't. Even though, yeah, you put cashews in F. Of course I did.

456
01:05:16,090 --> 01:05:20,659
They taste, they're like the meat. They taste like meat. They're like the meat of the peanut world.

457
01:05:20,659 --> 01:05:28,250
I'm not looking forward to doing that. Okay, so here we go. Um, stick that over there for now.

458
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:36,630
Right there is fine. All right, so now we got Milk Duds. Milk Duds, the problem I have with these is

459
01:05:36,630 --> 01:05:41,190
after you put this in your mouth and you chew it up, you wanna, I made the reference two days ago.

460
01:05:41,190 --> 01:05:46,650
You go watch that. I'll give you, I'll give you a minute. Go watch the VOD from a couple days ago

461
01:05:46,650 --> 01:05:53,940
and you will see why I don't like these. 30% less? Oh no. Okay, I thought that said 30% less is in

462
01:05:53,940 --> 01:06:00,730
the container. Like what? What do you mean 30% less? Like that's like something to advertise.

463
01:06:01,530 --> 01:06:10,730
So if, when you eat a Milk Dud, it gets to a point, a part, a part. Whoa, whoa.

464
01:06:12,820 --> 01:06:23,219
It gets to a point where they're just kind of chewed up gum and they look awful. Oh, these,

465
01:06:23,219 --> 01:06:29,340
oh wait, are these supposed to look like this? Are they supposed to be like squished like that?

466
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:34,090
Are they not supposed to be like that? I don't think it's supposed to be like this.

467
01:06:35,639 --> 01:06:38,619
These are crushed. Are these supposed to be like this?

468
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:47,179
These look like they've already been chewed. These are, these are supposed to look like that?

469
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:59,019
Are you sure? Don't they look like they've already been chewed? This is what they look like?

470
01:07:00,940 --> 01:07:20,789
Is it? I thought they were supposed to be like circles. These are terrible.

471
01:07:20,789 --> 01:07:32,010
And I mean absolutely awful. This might be the worst one of the night. These, I have to be fair,

472
01:07:32,010 --> 01:07:45,659
right? These might be the worst of the night by a long shot. I would rather eat a full bar of mounds

473
01:07:45,659 --> 01:07:51,130
than eat like another few of these. The texture looks, is kind of, they look off.

474
01:07:52,090 --> 01:07:59,500
Texture doesn't operate. Do the same thing this time. Do, okay, do the same thing. Okay, okay.

475
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:14,710
Hold on. It looks like rat shit. These are huge. Those are like giant, those rats are huge. Oh my

476
01:08:14,710 --> 01:08:26,729
God. Hold on. That's like a gigantic like sewer rat. It's a, they look kind of bad. These look

477
01:08:26,729 --> 01:08:29,130
like they were left in the sun or something. All right, I'll do it the way you guys say it.

478
01:08:29,130 --> 01:08:50,890
Here we go. Again, the old guy had to sit in the chair. Oh, hold on. Ooh, the chocolate is not

479
01:08:50,890 --> 01:08:57,369
nearly as good as the Whopper chocolate. Not even close. This is more Tootsie Roll chocolate. Not

480
01:08:57,369 --> 01:09:09,420
even close. It's still bad. Not even close. You know why I didn't want to do that? Because now I

481
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:23,460
have the caramel here. No. These are F. Doing that changed my mind. The Whoppers is not going to

482
01:09:23,539 --> 01:09:35,399
change my mind. It's still bad. It's still F. Who eats these? I feel like it is like a BuzzFeed

483
01:09:35,399 --> 01:09:40,840
video and I'm from like fucking like Britain or something. Who? No, they don't actually,

484
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:48,039
Americans eat these. Oh, fucking bollocks. No, why? Oh, it's disgusting. No, they're actually

485
01:09:48,039 --> 01:09:59,100
eating these. Yeah, I feel like that's what I'm doing. Oh, the Paper Ruth is right. Okay,

486
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:18,140
I actually really don't like these. And we're making a lot of jokes. I mean, we're making a

487
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:22,460
ton of jokes, right? I'm trying to be fair because like they've been around for a long time. Who

488
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:28,279
makes these? Who actually? They're gluten-free and they're gluten-free. Hershey makes these.

489
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:34,970
It's just not good. It's just, I just don't like it. I really just don't. I'm trying to be very

490
01:10:34,970 --> 01:10:43,619
fair and I just read their F. Oh, that was stuck. Oh, did you see that on camera? Okay, so now we

491
01:10:43,619 --> 01:10:52,760
got Baby Ruth. What is in a Baby Ruth? Who makes Baby Ruth? Dry roasted peanuts, rich caramel and

492
01:10:52,760 --> 01:11:05,260
smooth nougat. What is it? I didn't say that. I did not say that this is rat shit. Somebody else

493
01:11:05,260 --> 01:11:14,470
did and I've read it. Baby Ruth. Here we go. I feel like this is kind of a, it's like a Snickers

494
01:11:15,109 --> 01:11:20,539
that like went to the gym for like six months. Because like, look at this. This is, this is

495
01:11:20,539 --> 01:11:29,979
full of, look at that. This is full of peanuts. A big what? Do not say cat shit. Don't say it.

496
01:11:30,859 --> 01:11:37,380
Did you say it? Did you say cat shit? Oh, I said cat shit. I thought I was like pretending to read

497
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:46,500
cat shit. Wait, the gopher? Caddyshack? This looks like this shit in the pool. Oh, it's a Baby Ruth.

498
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:54,420
That's okay. It looks, we can't go into this with, this is bias. This looks like a Snickers

499
01:11:55,239 --> 01:12:00,489
that has way too much stuff in it, but we'll find out. Here we go. Excuse me. I need total

500
01:12:00,489 --> 01:12:52,779
silence please. I'm just like a dry ass Snickers. It's good. I feel like this has got more,

501
01:12:56,119 --> 01:13:00,920
another thing is like, oh, if you're hungry, eat a Snickers. Who's eating Snickers when they're

502
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:08,439
hungry, right? I feel like this is what that commercial is actually saying. This has way more

503
01:13:08,439 --> 01:13:18,890
peanuts than Snickers. This feels a little more like filling that, it's got way more peanuts.

504
01:13:18,890 --> 01:13:22,659
I love Snickers and this just kind of just tastes like, you know what this is? You know

505
01:13:22,659 --> 01:13:31,850
what this tastes like? This tastes like a homemade Snickers. Like there's like a YouTube video

506
01:13:31,850 --> 01:13:37,640
showing how to make a Snickers and this is what it is. It's not bad, but it's not, it's not a

507
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:48,149
Snickers. That's what I want. I did just say it's a dry ass Snickers. I know. Why, I'm not going to,

508
01:13:48,149 --> 01:13:57,159
no, you're doing it wrong. You have to, it's an energy bar Snickers. Yeah. All right. It's not an

509
01:13:57,159 --> 01:14:12,659
F. It's like, I would eat this. I'm going to, I'm going to save this. That's like a C minus.

510
01:14:12,659 --> 01:14:26,140
That's not a skill issue. It's a C minus. That is, oh, is it, is it above mounds? Oh,

511
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:38,630
fuck. This is hard. Mounds is, oh no, it's not. That's hard because they're both like, I feel

512
01:14:38,630 --> 01:14:44,090
like I would rather eat a baby Ruth, but I feel like mounds tasted better. So I'd say it's below

513
01:14:44,090 --> 01:14:51,130
amount, below amounts. All right. There's that. Uh, we also, that, we're, oh, we're at the end

514
01:14:51,130 --> 01:15:05,560
of the chocolate here. We have cookie dough bites. Egg-free recipe. Our dough-licious dough. I can

515
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:11,640
always tell how, usually they have like a huge, like five paragraphs of being like cookie, cookie,

516
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:15,079
yummy, yummy, dough-licious, right? Like they have like a bunch of like bullshit in the back,

517
01:15:15,079 --> 01:15:23,479
but they don't. This contains milk, soy, and wheat. It's also packaged in a facility that it has

518
01:15:23,479 --> 01:15:30,180
peanuts, tree nuts, milk, solids, eggs, wheat, soy. They all, okay. Don't eat, don't eat these.

519
01:15:31,060 --> 01:15:42,569
Don't, apparently don't eat these. Nobody can eat these. Ooh, look at that. That's actually pretty

520
01:15:42,569 --> 01:15:49,380
cool. Nope. No other candy with that. No other candy like this came in a bag. That gets points.

521
01:15:53,140 --> 01:16:02,069
Milk solids. They get points. Don't bat-chest me. That's it. Okay. This is like, I can carry this.

522
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:13,979
I don't want to like go. No, that's a, that gets points. Pollution? That was a weird smell. That

523
01:16:13,979 --> 01:16:32,569
was actually kind of off-putting. I opened that bag and somebody fought it in my face. Cookie bites.

524
01:16:32,569 --> 01:16:42,779
All right though. But yeah, I mean, come on. Yeah. Not that good though. My initial reaction was like

525
01:16:42,779 --> 01:16:57,029
cookie dough. I love cookie dough. And then it was like, ooh, no. Yeah. Honestly, like I would just

526
01:16:57,029 --> 01:17:05,619
rather not have any chocolate on this. They're good, but I feel like, I feel like I just want

527
01:17:05,619 --> 01:17:19,399
cookie dough. It is a little weird. It's actually kind of good though. Yeah. Nice microplastics

528
01:17:19,399 --> 01:17:32,380
you're eating. Okay. These are not F. You know where this would, these would actually be amazing?

529
01:17:32,380 --> 01:17:49,829
Part of a sundae. I'm still eating. We're good. These are, the more I'm eating, the more I like it.

530
01:17:49,829 --> 01:18:01,689
I picked it up and put it here. It's microplastic Andy. Microplastic Andy. It's a plastic bag. It's

531
01:18:01,689 --> 01:18:11,829
not microplastics in the food. These are actually pretty good. I could imagine these frozen. Like

532
01:18:11,829 --> 01:18:21,500
it says, try them frozen. That would be actually, wow. That would be, that'd be way better. It's

533
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:26,890
good. It was like, when I opened the bag, it was weird. It was almost like all like the, like the

534
01:18:26,890 --> 01:18:34,710
smelly gas in here or whatever it is. Like it was just like boom right in my face. It's definitely

535
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:52,279
not a B. I don't know. Is it a C though? What's on C right now? Whoppers are better. Are these

536
01:18:52,279 --> 01:18:59,239
better than a cantaloupe? I feel like that's unfair. Hey, but it's like a, hey, do you like

537
01:18:59,239 --> 01:19:07,720
cookie dough more than you like cantaloupe? Yeah. Oh, okay. Well, that's not fair. It's,

538
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:20,659
cantaloupe's better. Better than Pepsi. Pepsi's better. I would, these could probably go up to

539
01:19:20,659 --> 01:19:28,340
B in the freezer. Actually not that bad. Actually pretty good. The smell was a little weird. I would

540
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:37,989
definitely put this in the freezer and put it on ice cream probably later tonight. He's going to

541
01:19:37,989 --> 01:19:45,130
get sick. The amount of candy that I'm eating is less than the amount of candy you ate at the last

542
01:19:45,130 --> 01:19:50,949
Spider-Man movie. Okay. It's less than you ate at Spider-Man. I think that's all the chocolate.

543
01:19:53,930 --> 01:20:00,060
There's nothing over here. There's nothing over here. All right. Now we're going to move into the

544
01:20:00,060 --> 01:20:05,380
gross candy. By the way, if you, if you're just joining us and you don't know what's going on,

545
01:20:05,380 --> 01:20:12,380
I saw somebody said, what the fuck is this shitty tier list? I am, I've taken every item. Well,

546
01:20:12,699 --> 01:20:20,890
90% of every item that I said was F or high or low D. This is all the things that I've said are F

547
01:20:20,890 --> 01:20:25,210
and I have to see if I got to go against my own bullshit. We're going to see opinions can change

548
01:20:25,210 --> 01:20:33,689
in a long time and some of them have. Not for this though. Hot tamales. I don't know why anybody

549
01:20:33,689 --> 01:20:45,260
eats these and like the fireball whiskey. Dude, fireball whiskey. It's fucking heinous. No, Otto's

550
01:20:45,260 --> 01:20:51,979
not going to get any of this. Don't worry. Don't worry. I'm being careful. This is what a hot tamale

551
01:20:51,979 --> 01:21:03,350
looks like. Oh, that smell. It's like a fucking Yankee candle. Yeah. This just smells like a

552
01:21:03,350 --> 01:21:07,189
candle from Yankee candle. Hot tamale. That's what they are. They're kind of like Mike and Ike's,

553
01:21:07,189 --> 01:21:44,329
but hot tamale. They're actually not bad. Don't do that. That was kind of enjoyable. That was

554
01:21:44,329 --> 01:22:03,369
enjoyable. Damn. Really? That was enjoyable, but I don't want another one. I don't know how people,

555
01:22:03,369 --> 01:22:09,720
okay, dude, please in the chat, tell me like, you're not eating all these. Like you sitting

556
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:17,590
there watching TV and just eating a fucking handful of these. No way, right? How many of

557
01:22:17,590 --> 01:22:23,659
these are you eating? Everyone that's like, dude, hot tamales, bro. Whoa, fire. Like how many are

558
01:22:23,659 --> 01:22:34,409
you eating? Because I feel like they just chew big bread. I feel like that was an enjoyable

559
01:22:34,409 --> 01:22:46,250
experience, but I don't want to like eat handfuls of these. Maybe two at a time. These are better

560
01:22:46,250 --> 01:22:56,920
than the hard candy fireballs, but I still don't really like them. My eyes. It tastes like big red.

561
01:22:56,920 --> 01:23:03,989
Do I put these in F though? But I mean, I feel like they kind of have to stay in F because I

562
01:23:03,989 --> 01:23:13,829
don't, I'm not going to eat anymore. Yeah. What's an F? Yeah, cutsy rose, honeydew,

563
01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:33,079
fucking diet Mountain Dew. Would I rather, but I mean, I don't want to eat this though.

564
01:23:33,079 --> 01:23:57,720
That was a fine experience, but you catching this? You catching this? Still trying it. Okay.

565
01:23:57,720 --> 01:24:16,739
It's better than red delicious apple. It is? I said, what? I didn't say F. They're D. They're

566
01:24:16,739 --> 01:24:21,460
better than an app. They're better than a red delicious apple though. Are they? I don't know.

567
01:24:21,460 --> 01:24:27,699
It's hard because I would eat a red delicious apple. If somebody, if you were like here,

568
01:24:27,699 --> 01:24:31,460
this is a red delicious apple. Eat this red delicious apple. I'd be like, okay,

569
01:24:31,460 --> 01:24:38,939
I don't love it, but like I wouldn't eat more than two of these. Yeah, they're D. I don't,

570
01:24:38,939 --> 01:24:48,710
I just, they just don't do it for me. Yeah. That's fair. That's fair. I don't, not a fan.

571
01:24:49,350 --> 01:24:53,510
They are better than the balls though. Like the fire balls. They're better than those

572
01:24:53,510 --> 01:25:01,079
because you know what? It's one and done. Like this kind of is like a breath mint to me.

573
01:25:01,079 --> 01:25:05,640
Like, oh, I'm, I'm, I'm got a big meeting. I got to like eat like a hot tamale to get like

574
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:13,430
cinnamon burst breath, right? Like to me, that's a breath mint. I'm making sure you stay the whole

575
01:25:13,430 --> 01:25:32,789
time. Oh, this is staying an F. This is staying an F. Ah, Swedish fish are bad. I can already

576
01:25:32,789 --> 01:25:55,369
tell by how it feels. Here we go. Do you like Swedish fish? Yeah. They smell like, um, it

577
01:25:55,369 --> 01:26:01,399
smells like melted candy or something. It smells like you like, you want to try it? It smells

578
01:26:01,399 --> 01:26:05,479
like kind of like melted candy, right? Like melted. All right. Here we go. I know people

579
01:26:05,479 --> 01:26:09,000
are pissed about this. Everyone was like, dude, you haven't tried it in like 10 years. Try it.

580
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:13,239
You'll like it. That's the whole purpose of the stream is to prove all you guys wrong

581
01:26:13,239 --> 01:26:43,210
that this is F. Is it, is it an F? But don't say anything to that. I don't know. It smells

582
01:26:43,210 --> 01:26:58,500
like a swimming pool. I don't know why. These are not Fs. Not even close. But again, the same

583
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:06,739
problem. Like I don't, I don't want to eat. This is this bag. I would eat like one of these and be

584
01:27:06,739 --> 01:27:12,039
like, okay. That was like, I don't know. It's like, I don't want to eat this whole bag. What's the

585
01:27:12,039 --> 01:27:20,390
serving size? Five pieces is a serving. I don't like, I just don't like, I'd rather have a gummy

586
01:27:20,390 --> 01:27:37,880
bear. Why would you eat a bag of this? Please. Don't, don't tell them. Don't please. Really?

587
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:43,560
Are you trying to tell me that when you buy this little bag of Swedish fish, you're going to eat

588
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:51,140
five fish for the recommended doctor thing on the back. And then that's enough. What are you

589
01:27:51,140 --> 01:27:58,680
talking about? Like you're going to sit there and eat until you don't want it anymore. Who does that?

590
01:27:58,680 --> 01:28:05,960
Oh, oh hot tamales. Oh yeah, dude. Let me see. 16 pieces per serving. I can't have more than 16.

591
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:16,819
16 pieces. I wouldn't want five for these. 16. That's a lot. Yeah. Guess what? Do you know how

592
01:28:16,819 --> 01:28:28,470
many cookies a serving of Oreos is? Don't look. Yes. What is a serving of Oreos? Yes. Yes. Don't

593
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:38,180
look it up. Okay. Yeah. Like two or three or three. All right. All these, all these Andes in here.

594
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:41,380
I'm not even, I'm not even going to give you a nickname. I'm going to call you Andy. All these

595
01:28:41,380 --> 01:28:49,029
Andes in here that pretend like they don't go to the Oreo sleeve and get as many as they can fit

596
01:28:49,029 --> 01:28:55,859
holding like this comfortably with the glass of milk. Please. Oh, I'm going to take two cookies.

597
01:28:55,859 --> 01:29:01,699
Nope. You're, excuse me. You're going to fit as many as you can. Oh, that was gross. I just spit

598
01:29:01,699 --> 01:29:11,350
a little bit up. No, she thought I was puking. No, I'm just talking and being rude and like not

599
01:29:11,350 --> 01:29:17,590
finishing the food in my mouth. You go like this. It's like one, two, three, four, five seconds,

600
01:29:17,590 --> 01:29:32,760
five. And then you eat, you know, nobody eats two. I, I never eat two Oreos ever. I usually eat like

601
01:29:32,760 --> 01:30:00,229
between three and five. Didn't change my mind. Those are better than Tootsie Rolls. What's,

602
01:30:00,229 --> 01:30:11,529
what's, okay. What is above F and low D? I don't know. Because a red delicious apple is the barrier

603
01:30:11,529 --> 01:30:30,100
to get to D. Okay. I'd rather eat a red delicious apple than a Swedish fish. I don't, people

604
01:30:30,100 --> 01:30:41,819
like hate me. That's fine. Is that I'd rather eat a red delicious apple as a candy. But aren't these,

605
01:30:41,819 --> 01:30:49,239
I just, I would rather have like the Haribo gummy bears. There is a red Haribo gummy bear that's

606
01:30:49,239 --> 01:30:58,250
better than this. Right. Look, I'm not telling you that how you need to feel. I'm not saying,

607
01:30:58,250 --> 01:31:03,829
Hey dude, I don't like Swedish fish. So fuck you. Don't clip that. One minute, one minute, one minute,

608
01:31:03,829 --> 01:31:06,069
one minute, one minute, one minute, one minute, one minute, one minute, one minute, one minute,

609
01:31:07,939 --> 01:31:13,529
I never said that. All I'm saying is that I find them to be off putting. I just don't really like

610
01:31:13,529 --> 01:31:17,850
them. This is like, I just, I don't, I couldn't eat more than one or two of those. All right,

611
01:31:17,850 --> 01:31:30,779
let's keep going. Oh right. This is okay. This is going to suck. This is the Bean Boozled game.

612
01:31:30,779 --> 01:31:36,699
I think I can just pick them out. It should be easy. I said that, okay. I said popcorn jelly

613
01:31:36,699 --> 01:31:44,340
beans were dog shit and everyone freaked out. You cannot just buy an in one day in 120. Remember

614
01:31:44,340 --> 01:31:49,460
this is like literally two days ago. We talked about doing this. I couldn't just buy popcorn.

615
01:31:49,460 --> 01:31:57,060
I couldn't buy popcorn flavor jelly beans anywhere. So the popcorn flavor jelly beans are in here,

616
01:31:57,060 --> 01:32:10,729
but half of them are rotten egg. This might be a little tricky. There's one right here. Is there

617
01:32:10,729 --> 01:32:18,939
a way to tell? Like, can I smell it? I don't know. It's either going to be rotten egg or

618
01:32:18,939 --> 01:32:24,949
buttered popcorn. I couldn't get them anywhere. Somebody said, what's the difference? I want that

619
01:32:24,949 --> 01:32:36,579
person to be very important for a minute. Cut into it and smell it. Okay. I think I can do with this.

620
01:32:48,579 --> 01:32:54,069
Huh? Somebody said they had the dog food one and it stayed in their mouth for days.

621
01:32:54,710 --> 01:33:04,539
This is buttered popcorn. I got it. Okay. Oh, it smells like buttered popcorn. Why? This shit

622
01:33:04,539 --> 01:33:09,529
was made in a goddamn laboratory. Buttered popcorn. This is accurate. Here we go. Is it,

623
01:33:09,529 --> 01:33:23,130
or is this a rotten egg? I don't know. I hope, I think it's buttered popcorn. Is it a rotten egg?

624
01:33:23,770 --> 01:33:35,979
I don't know. I can't, I can't tell. I actually, I can't tell. No, you're good. I don't know. I don't

625
01:33:35,979 --> 01:33:45,850
know. I don't know. No, I think this is rotten egg. No, it's a buttered popcorn. Why? Who eats this

626
01:33:45,850 --> 01:33:58,649
shit? Oh my God. This is no, I kind of, I need to know if that was rotten egg. I like, I kind of

627
01:33:58,649 --> 01:34:10,760
like what I know. My brain is like telling me, Polly's right here and she's like, maybe you

628
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:14,119
should cut it first and don't eat it right away. Why? Yeah. Cause like, I'm going to have like

629
01:34:14,119 --> 01:34:28,420
rotten egg breath. I would know. Somebody said just eat a handful. That'd be so fucked up. You'd

630
01:34:28,420 --> 01:34:34,310
probably have like, you'd probably have like a fucking like mental breakdown. It's not designed

631
01:34:34,310 --> 01:34:57,029
for that. Eat a handful. I'm kind of curious. I'm curious. Let's go. It tastes like hamburger meat.

632
01:34:57,029 --> 01:35:53,029
It tastes like hamburger meat. It tastes like raw hamburger meat. Auto filled in. What did you,

633
01:35:53,029 --> 01:36:01,539
what did you do? Auto ate a cookie. Okay. Buttered popcorn is F. That honestly tastes like,

634
01:36:01,539 --> 01:36:06,180
it tastes like raw hamburger meat. I have no idea. What was the, what was the possibilities?

635
01:36:06,180 --> 01:36:20,420
Cause I know I had like a, it was a, it was like two blues, pink. Oh, what the fuck? What's wrong

636
01:36:20,420 --> 01:36:26,789
with these people? Why would you make that? Now I know what it is. Band-aid, an old band-aid with

637
01:36:26,789 --> 01:36:40,470
blood on it. Oh, okay. No, I'm okay. So that was, that was barf, pomegranate, old band-aid,

638
01:36:42,310 --> 01:36:48,470
rotten egg, liver and onions, toothpaste and berry. It just literally tastes like raw

639
01:36:48,470 --> 01:37:09,369
hamburger meat. I'm okay. No, I guess it's all gone. We'll do a palate cleanse. I don't know why,

640
01:37:09,369 --> 01:37:14,390
why people do this. I know it's like, it's like content to do this. And I'm not just talking about

641
01:37:14,390 --> 01:37:19,109
like streams or YouTube. This is like friend content where everyone goes like, well, what is

642
01:37:19,109 --> 01:37:24,840
it? And it's like, everyone like runs away and shit. But like, no fucking just like read a book,

643
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:29,659
go fucking LARP somewhere. You know what I mean? Go like LARPing. Don't, don't do this.

644
01:37:29,659 --> 01:37:36,170
But play like fucking N64. All right. Well, the butter popcorn is F and I think it might be really

645
01:37:36,170 --> 01:37:45,670
low. What, what, what is in F right now? Okay. Swedish, Swedish fish are way better than butter

646
01:37:45,670 --> 01:37:50,710
popcorn. I know I hate them. My opinion does not change, but I mean, this would be like fun,

647
01:37:50,710 --> 01:38:03,029
friend content, baby. Worse than Twitzy Roll. There's way worse than a honeydew melon. In fact,

648
01:38:03,029 --> 01:38:07,590
you know what? I think honeydew, honeydew, I mean, this is like a bunch of other, the candy shit,

649
01:38:07,590 --> 01:38:12,970
but I mean, of course I would rather eat a honeydew melon than eat a buttered popcorn.

650
01:38:12,970 --> 01:38:23,779
Don't say it's worse than milk does. But what did this person say? He said, look, man, if your

651
01:38:23,779 --> 01:38:27,460
perception of the candy is already at F tier, I don't think a half ass taste test is going to

652
01:38:27,460 --> 01:38:33,159
change the scoring wildly. Tell that to Whoppers. Tell that to Red Delicious Apple. Tell that to

653
01:38:33,159 --> 01:38:37,180
Baby Ruth. Some of these have changed dramatically. Some of these have actually changed dramatically.

654
01:38:41,210 --> 01:38:47,369
Whopper was at F and now I put it all the way up to like C and B. Would you rather eat a honeydew

655
01:38:47,369 --> 01:39:00,920
melon or a bloody bandaid? Well, you know, I'm not so sure. All right, here we go. A lot of people

656
01:39:00,920 --> 01:39:16,779
have been waiting for Fun Dip. Okay. Fun Dip. I put Fun Dip at F or D because it's been a long time.

657
01:39:19,159 --> 01:39:25,020
It's been a long time. I just remember being like, and this is the sour kind. So Fun Dip is S and

658
01:39:25,100 --> 01:39:38,500
that's why this is why I'm doing this. It's all that was available at Walmart. Let's get a stick.

659
01:39:38,500 --> 01:39:46,630
We're going to do stick only first and I'm going to write that. How the fuck are you supposed to

660
01:39:46,630 --> 01:39:52,340
open this? You can't bring this to the office. It starts at D, literally starts at D. How are you

661
01:39:52,340 --> 01:39:55,619
supposed to eat this? How am I going to eat this? How do I do this? How am I supposed to eat this?

662
01:39:55,619 --> 01:40:12,180
I think it's like, okay, there we go. Yep. Okay. Fun Dip executive. How are you supposed to do this?

663
01:40:12,180 --> 01:40:20,619
Look, I'm like, I can't even get into this. But okay, here it is. We're going to try this

664
01:40:20,619 --> 01:40:41,909
by itself. I like the smell. Hmm. Okay. I remember these being a lot chalkier than it is.

665
01:40:41,909 --> 01:40:49,340
You just keep the stick, man. You don't need anything else. Do they just sell Fun Dip sticks?

666
01:40:49,340 --> 01:41:01,979
I would rather just eat this. Yeah, this is like very, this is very nice. Bite it. No, don't. All

667
01:41:01,979 --> 01:41:08,970
right, here we go. We're going to start with the Strawberry Smackerie Dew Dip, then the Watermelon

668
01:41:08,970 --> 01:41:21,850
Wimmo Dip, and then the Tartastic Mystery Dip. Strawberry Watermelon Mystery. Come on, Gwen.

669
01:41:21,850 --> 01:41:33,430
Why am I using crochet scissors? Okay, here we go. This is Strawberry Smackerie Dew. You go like

670
01:41:33,430 --> 01:42:06,649
this, right? I'm doing it right? That's good. Fuck. Fuck. That's good. It is good. It's not too sour

671
01:42:06,649 --> 01:42:15,140
either. I thought it was going to be like, ooh, Warheads. This is, this is fantastic. And they

672
01:42:15,140 --> 01:42:22,250
give you three flavors. I'm actually excited. This is, all right. I was wrong. I was wrong. You know

673
01:42:22,250 --> 01:42:26,010
this is because I was like, oh, like kids eat this. You know what I mean? Like, oh, Fun Dip for kids.

674
01:42:26,010 --> 01:42:35,000
I'm like, why would I, why would I buy this? The strawberry one. I don't fucking need to open the

675
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:43,560
rest of it. Fun Dip Executive. Okay. All right. I think I got, I got a taste for that. And they

676
01:42:43,560 --> 01:42:50,659
give you two sticks. The value here is actually, it's phenomenal. I'm actually kind of sad. I'm

677
01:42:50,659 --> 01:42:53,939
not going to be able to eat this all. Wait, hold on. Let's check. The mystery flavor could, wait,

678
01:42:53,939 --> 01:43:05,800
the mystery flavor could be barf. We don't know. There could be rotten egg. That's incredibly

679
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:10,569
enjoyable. I wish I was fucking making this up. I don't, I really don't want to like this. This is

680
01:43:10,569 --> 01:43:24,550
watermelon. I mean, it's just, it's, it's, it's just phenomenal. It's a perfect amount of sweetness.

681
01:43:24,550 --> 01:43:30,869
It's a perfect amount of like sugar. I always thought this was like just an absolute sugar bomb.

682
01:43:30,869 --> 01:43:40,539
That this tastes light. This is, this tastes light to me. Fuck. I thought I hated these. I really

683
01:43:40,539 --> 01:43:49,159
thought I hated this. It's light. It is just sugar. Mix them together. We're not doing that yet.

684
01:43:51,289 --> 01:43:57,590
Throw a Band-Aid in here. Imagine like, I don't know. I didn't know what it tastes like with a

685
01:43:57,590 --> 01:44:04,250
Band-Aid. Okay. Good. What about the mystery? Fuck. I would want to just eat these. Be careful

686
01:44:04,250 --> 01:44:18,539
with these. Okay. There's nothing here for you. I haven't dropped anything. He's good. Okay. This

687
01:44:18,539 --> 01:44:46,310
is blue. This is blue. That's the best one yet. That's the best one yet. What? What did they say?

688
01:44:46,310 --> 01:45:09,449
Pregnancy test? I can't even eat it now. Oh, why'd you do that? This was S. This was S. You,

689
01:45:09,449 --> 01:45:14,970
I was going to put it in S. And now I'm like, there's a pregnancy test in my mouth. What the

690
01:45:15,050 --> 01:45:31,989
fuck? Okay. No, don't do that either. Don't do that either. Okay. Very important. Very, I feel

691
01:45:31,989 --> 01:45:40,649
like I'm going like frost-eyed right here. Okay. Very important. This is, oh, you ruined it. You

692
01:45:40,649 --> 01:45:54,899
ruined it. It was going to be like A+. All right. Let's mix them. We're going to do strawberry.

693
01:45:54,899 --> 01:46:03,369
Okay. Here we go. We're going to do, we're going to do not pregnant mixed with pregnant. And then

694
01:46:03,369 --> 01:46:23,300
we're going to do, um, I don't know, UTI. Oh no. I'm trying to think of other things you piss on.

695
01:46:23,300 --> 01:46:28,579
I guess, well, you piss, like I'm thinking of pee. Like, yeah, but like pregnancy tests, like,

696
01:46:28,579 --> 01:46:33,300
okay, what else is a test? It's just candy. It's just candy. It's candy. It's candy. It's candy.

697
01:46:35,380 --> 01:46:40,899
Why did I say that? I don't know. Cause you said pregnancy test. You said that I was sitting here

698
01:46:40,899 --> 01:46:47,220
enjoying the mystery flavor of sunny delight. That's not what this is. The mystery flavor of

699
01:46:47,220 --> 01:46:53,909
fun dip. And I hear pregnancy test and I'm like, okay, well gross. Well, let me one up. You hear

700
01:46:53,909 --> 01:47:05,109
that. They're all fantastic. This is S. I was thinking of what else, like for the thing like

701
01:47:05,109 --> 01:47:21,720
these, you notice you don't pee on a COVID test. You don't pee on a COVID test. All right. Let's

702
01:47:21,720 --> 01:47:43,670
bite the stick. Let's see how it feels. Tastes like marshmallows. Good. I was wrong. I apologize

703
01:47:43,670 --> 01:47:48,489
profusely. I would keep eating this. I would. In fact, I might, I might actually seal this up.

704
01:47:48,489 --> 01:47:58,460
That's S. I was wrong. I put it in F and it was wrong. I was completely and totally incorrect.

705
01:47:58,460 --> 01:48:07,560
Fun dip is S tier. I'm sorry. I apologize. Should I just get it out of the way? Should I get it out

706
01:48:07,560 --> 01:48:17,880
of the way now? Hey, how are you? Jeremy985 here. Make sure you hit that bell and stay for a while

707
01:48:17,880 --> 01:48:23,609
to the end of the video. I'm going to check these out. These are your favorite. I said they were F.

708
01:48:23,609 --> 01:48:31,319
Hey, hit that bell and check it out. Stay tuned. Probably tomorrow. I've never, I felt like I'm

709
01:48:31,319 --> 01:48:37,430
going to hate those. That's going to be the big reveal. All right. Mike and Ike's. We're actually,

710
01:48:38,390 --> 01:48:41,270
there's not that much left. We're doing good. How long, how long is the streaming going for?

711
01:48:44,619 --> 01:48:51,800
Lower left of the OBS window should be like in the very, very lower left. Like the bottom, like,

712
01:48:51,800 --> 01:49:01,689
like the task manager. Is it not there? Hour and 49. All right. Let's go. I have 30k viewers right

713
01:49:01,689 --> 01:49:06,409
now. What are you doing here? All right. These are original. I know that like, dude, get the tropical

714
01:49:06,409 --> 01:49:11,369
ones. Get this, the, the other ones. This is original Mike and Ike, original fruits,

715
01:49:11,930 --> 01:49:23,130
original fruit flavors. These are the originals. Waiting for Trolli. Yeah. Make sure to hit that

716
01:49:24,569 --> 01:49:34,420
bell. All right. Which one do I eat first? People were pissed that I didn't like these.

717
01:49:34,420 --> 01:49:44,220
Remember it was like, dude, you have to eat the Trolli, please. There's a lot of reds in here.

718
01:49:44,220 --> 01:50:28,100
Red. Okay. I'm going for red. Red. Red. No. Contestant medicine. No. No. You have to,

719
01:50:28,100 --> 01:50:33,640
it's only fair if you try each one. Yeah, this is, that was bad. It tastes like kind of like,

720
01:50:33,640 --> 01:50:41,699
it kind of tastes like medicine. Eat the green one. Well, hold on. I got, I'm all right.

721
01:50:41,699 --> 01:50:51,180
Got orange here. Oh, I'm doing fine. You're gonna, you're gonna have diarrhea. So what?

722
01:50:51,180 --> 01:51:14,340
Do orange. Way better than red. Way better. That was actually very good. I have to be fair though.

723
01:51:14,340 --> 01:51:24,840
I'm going to rate these individually and then average the score. Red. F. Orange. B. Orange was

724
01:51:24,840 --> 01:51:41,850
a B. We have F. We have B. Is yellow. A. We've got an F. We have a B. We have an A. Yellow is A.

725
01:51:41,850 --> 01:51:52,760
I love that like tart lemon flavor. Oh, hell yeah. Okay. We only got two more. We've got, what are

726
01:51:52,760 --> 01:52:00,810
they? Oh, red is cherry. That, I thought it was going to be strawberry. Okay. So that might have

727
01:52:00,810 --> 01:52:09,220
fucked up my brain. This is, this is strawberry. I thought red was strawberry. All right. Let's see.

728
01:52:09,220 --> 01:52:25,140
Let's see what strawberry. That was A. B. F. What about, what about this one? This tastes like it's

729
01:52:25,140 --> 01:52:49,590
not good. What? It's a very specific strawberry, like fake flavor, and it's not good. That was

730
01:52:49,590 --> 01:53:02,869
the worst one. F. Green. Green. You're gonna have to save it here. Green. Obi-Wan Kenobi.

731
01:53:02,869 --> 01:53:38,329
Eventually gave his lightsaber to Luke. Luke had a blue lightsaber. You fucking lost me. You lost me.

732
01:53:38,329 --> 01:53:54,100
I thought that was going to be sour apple. I was waiting for green apple and I got lime. I was

733
01:53:54,100 --> 01:54:14,300
waiting for like a sour tart green apple, like Jolly Rancher flavor. Lime. I'm not going to eat

734
01:54:14,300 --> 01:54:47,670
them all at once. Oh, no. I don't like it. Actually, it's all right. Oh, that's actually

735
01:54:47,670 --> 01:55:01,369
kind of good. All right. What we got? A. B. B. A. B. B. F. F. What's that average to? Is that a C?

736
01:55:01,369 --> 01:55:08,180
A. B. B. F. F. Did he already do the Bean Boozle? Yeah, dude. Rewind. I puked all over the place.

737
01:55:08,180 --> 01:55:16,970
We had to redo the whole thing. So that's a high, that's a C? Yeah, they're all right. I was probably

738
01:55:16,970 --> 01:55:29,750
unfair. I'll be really honest. I'd rather eat this than any of those. Like, whoppers were good,

739
01:55:29,750 --> 01:55:37,689
but like I feel like, no, maybe a below whopper. That was, I was unfair. I said, you know, I said

740
01:55:37,689 --> 01:55:43,979
they were boring and they actually are not boring. It was like a burst of flavor. I don't know why in

741
01:55:43,979 --> 01:55:49,060
my brain the flavor profile of these was way more diluted than that, what just was. Did they change

742
01:55:49,060 --> 01:55:56,260
the recipe? Because that was, that was good. Some of those were really, really good. The lemon one,

743
01:55:56,260 --> 01:56:03,539
perfect. Orange was nearly good. Yeah, that was good. That was fine. I would eat the rest of these.

744
01:56:03,539 --> 01:56:17,130
I will. Let's put it in the storage unit over here. All right. It's getting there. Here come dots.

745
01:56:17,130 --> 01:56:25,539
I don't want to do a handful. I don't want to eat. I'm trying to just do like one or two at a time.

746
01:56:25,539 --> 01:56:30,789
They taste like colors. Yeah. Dots. Everyone says F. Everybody does, but I have to be fair.

747
01:56:32,500 --> 01:56:43,670
Oh, okay. What happened? What happened? Tootsie makes these. What happened? What else does Tootsie

748
01:56:43,670 --> 01:56:48,520
make? Man, I just don't, I don't think I like anything from the Tootsie Roll company. Do I?

749
01:56:48,520 --> 01:57:02,199
Do I like anything from Tootsie Roll? I love dots. I have not eaten these in 10 fucking years.

750
01:57:02,199 --> 01:57:14,170
Let's find out. Tootsie Pops. Yeah, but I know Tootsie Pops are good. I feel like Tootsie needs

751
01:57:14,170 --> 01:57:23,100
more to be good than just be a Tootsie. All right. Here we go. Dots. Sorted fruit flavored gum drops.

752
01:57:28,460 --> 01:57:37,239
Okay. Give it a try. This is old people. Um, I don't think, I don't think so. I don't know

753
01:57:37,239 --> 01:57:43,300
very many old people that would eat these. All right. Let's give it a try. What do I get first?

754
01:57:43,300 --> 01:57:58,579
This is pink it looks like. Oh no. It just smells like, it smells like plastic. Like it doesn't smell

755
01:57:58,579 --> 01:58:20,149
like candy. This is apocalypse food. Like this is, this is like currency. Like I've been like a

756
01:58:20,149 --> 01:58:43,930
thousand years and like the apocalypse happens. This is like, this is apocalypse food. God. The

757
01:58:43,930 --> 01:58:50,069
thing is this is apocalypse food, right? But I feel like these, I feel like this, these will last

758
01:58:50,069 --> 01:59:02,149
like a hundred years. I mean it's, it's, it's, it is what it is. It is what it is. It's exactly

759
01:59:02,149 --> 01:59:07,779
you know what, you know what you're getting. You know what it is. It's just like a slimy,

760
01:59:07,779 --> 01:59:16,020
like waxy F tier candy. Last, this is lasting a very long time though. I could just sit here like

761
01:59:16,020 --> 01:59:25,779
this and it's okay. That's what I'm saying. This is apocalypse food. Like you could suck on a dot

762
01:59:25,779 --> 01:59:30,260
like while you're like going out and looking for supplies and shooting at the zombies and shit.

763
01:59:30,260 --> 01:59:36,890
Like this will last like the four hours. Like let me just say it like this. Go, go, go, go, go,

764
01:59:36,890 --> 01:59:45,189
you know what I mean? Like everybody like hates these, right? Everybody talks shit about these,

765
01:59:45,189 --> 01:59:57,300
but I mean these, the only purpose for these is to put on the top of gingerbread houses.

766
01:59:57,300 --> 02:00:03,699
And then you go like, and then eat like the frosting. I mean it's just a, it's just like

767
02:00:03,699 --> 02:00:09,260
a gumdrop. Does everything have to be flashy with like sour fun dip with like three flavors

768
02:00:09,260 --> 02:00:14,539
and one of them's a mystery loot box. I mean it's just, it's just candy. It's just like regular ass

769
02:00:14,539 --> 02:00:25,180
candy and you can just suck, I mean you suck on for, they last a long time. I think it's okay.

770
02:00:26,680 --> 02:00:29,720
I mean I'm going to put them in F because I think they belong there, but I mean I don't,

771
02:00:32,250 --> 02:00:38,260
this is like, this is like an American staple. You know what I mean? Apple pie, McDonald's,

772
02:00:38,260 --> 02:01:02,149
Dots. Like it's, it's like American old candy. It's a D. It's D. Who sucks on Dots?

773
02:01:03,829 --> 02:01:18,659
Whoa! Whoa, hold on. Yeah! You're supposed to chew them? I like my way, way better. You're

774
02:01:18,659 --> 02:01:44,520
supposed to chew them? Yeah, hold on. All right, hold on. Hold on, hold on, hold on. No. I mean

775
02:01:44,600 --> 02:01:53,739
it's just these. These are the same except this one texturally is better and I think the flavors

776
02:01:53,739 --> 02:02:04,779
are better. They're the same exact candy to me. They're like, this one's just better. I mean maybe

777
02:02:04,779 --> 02:02:09,260
if you don't like the kind of hard outside, this is just a soft outside version of Mike and Ike's.

778
02:02:09,260 --> 02:02:18,539
I think they're D for me. They're D minus. I'm not spending any more time on Dots. They're better

779
02:02:18,539 --> 02:02:21,579
than Hot Tamales. Whoa, wait a minute. Yeah, they're better than Hot Tamales. Are they? No,

780
02:02:21,579 --> 02:02:31,420
they're not. What's, what's in front of that? Yeah, they're worse than Almond Joy, but they're okay.

781
02:02:36,010 --> 02:02:44,840
All right, everybody's waiting. Everybody's waiting to see what the streamer has to say about Trolley.

782
02:02:47,369 --> 02:03:04,569
Trolley. Yeah, the Swizzlers too, but those are F. Trolley? I've never had these. I just assumed

783
02:03:04,569 --> 02:03:09,539
they were F because I don't like gummy worms because gummy worms are for children. Fuck it,

784
02:03:09,539 --> 02:03:17,859
let's go. I'm doing it right now. I got a lot of shit the other day saying that I would put these

785
02:03:17,859 --> 02:03:27,859
in F or D. I'm ready. Let's go. I almost dropped it. Here we go. Moment of truth for Trolley.

786
02:03:37,060 --> 02:03:55,420
I didn't mean to. They don't smell good. They smell very fake. All right, I was told to eat

787
02:03:55,420 --> 02:04:15,560
the pink and blue one first. Here it is. Here we go. Let me cleanse the palette. Okay, here we go.

788
02:04:15,560 --> 02:05:09,180
They're good, but they're not S. Don't say that. Green, green and orange coming up. I thought these

789
02:05:09,180 --> 02:05:17,590
are going to be way more sour, like a Sour Patch Kid. That part is fantastic. Once, once all the,

790
02:05:17,590 --> 02:05:38,619
all the sand comes off though, I don't know, they become a weird, I don't know. That was an A.

791
02:05:38,619 --> 02:05:45,539
That was an A minus. That one. And if that's the best, if that's what you're telling me is the best

792
02:05:45,539 --> 02:06:11,300
trolley, I'm not too excited about the rest. That one's all right. The orange part I don't

793
02:06:11,300 --> 02:06:18,460
really like that much. The green part is good. Stop chewing them. Stop, don't chew them. I thought

794
02:06:18,460 --> 02:06:22,949
I was supposed to chew, I thought I was supposed to swallow them. You want me to just like, like a,

795
02:06:22,949 --> 02:06:32,390
what am I, a bird? Am I a fucking baby bird? Do I look like, do I got a beak? Do I have a beak?

796
02:06:32,390 --> 02:06:41,989
Okay, that was all right. That was a B. You know, but hold on, here's the thing.

797
02:06:41,989 --> 02:06:45,350
I thought these were huge. The reason why I didn't ever buy these is because I thought

798
02:06:45,350 --> 02:06:51,960
they were like these like gross, like, like, like six, seven inch long things. I didn't think they

799
02:06:51,960 --> 02:07:05,850
were this little. I thought they were like going to be these curly Q like blah. I didn't know they

800
02:07:05,850 --> 02:07:16,979
were little. Why are you chewing for so long? I'm just chewing the food. Why would I think that?

801
02:07:16,979 --> 02:07:23,460
Gummy worms are long, aren't they? Red yellow is not good. Okay, well trolley's the best. Get trolley.

802
02:07:24,100 --> 02:07:34,779
Except only eat one of the colors in there, not the other like 35%. Okay, so we're gonna,

803
02:07:34,779 --> 02:07:40,500
okay, after I do the candy, we'll probably clean up a little bit. So after I do these next two

804
02:07:40,500 --> 02:07:43,510
candies, we're gonna clean up. We're gonna move some of the stuff out of the fridge.

805
02:07:44,149 --> 02:07:49,300
We'll do our chips. I'm very excited about this. I'm gonna piss a lot of you off.

806
02:07:49,300 --> 02:08:03,260
All right, here we go. That was bad. Yeah, that was way too harsh. It was like a way too acidic

807
02:08:03,260 --> 02:08:13,239
in the first second. No, I don't, they're all, they're good. That first one was fantastic.

808
02:08:13,239 --> 02:08:32,760
Trolley, nice try. Nice try. It's a B. Everybody thought it, no, that's not an S. All right,

809
02:08:32,760 --> 02:08:38,489
the part on the outside. Okay, if this was a stick, if this was a stick and I could suck it and it

810
02:08:38,489 --> 02:08:48,220
was a stick, I would like it. Why are these even here? Why do I even have these? Apple jacks? Like,

811
02:08:48,220 --> 02:08:53,770
I'm gonna eat a bowl of cereal right now? No, I'll eat these for breakfast fucking someday.

812
02:08:54,409 --> 02:09:00,579
Apple jacks are fucking C. I don't even need to eat them. Oh, we got like red too. All right, okay.

813
02:09:01,670 --> 02:09:10,659
What is um, oh, orange slices. It's cafeteria food.

814
02:09:16,520 --> 02:09:21,720
I didn't want to buy a box of apple jacks though, man. Like, I'm not gonna buy a whole box.

815
02:09:21,720 --> 02:09:30,039
These are the orange slices. Do I even really need to eat one of these? I feel like I'm gonna

816
02:09:30,039 --> 02:09:46,939
fucking hate it. Find out. Orange slices are really good. Yeah, I know, more or less the candy.

817
02:09:46,939 --> 02:10:01,770
All right, orange slices. Oh, these are awful looking. They're hard. They've got a stiffness

818
02:10:01,770 --> 02:10:10,090
to them that I cannot describe on camera. It's Walmart brand. Do the, does the brand really

819
02:10:10,090 --> 02:10:24,699
matter? Does the brand matter for these? They all were made in like 1950. Orange slices. Here we go.

820
02:10:24,699 --> 02:10:58,420
Oh, this smells like a Christmas decoration. Who's gonna buy this as a gas station? It turns into this,

821
02:10:58,420 --> 02:11:08,229
what was it? The brand matters. It's great value. What's wrong with great value brand?

822
02:11:14,890 --> 02:11:30,949
There's an aftertaste here that is very bad. It's a very bad aftertaste. I look sick.

823
02:11:32,149 --> 02:11:42,460
I'm just sitting here like, they kind of look like slugs. Doesn't the packaging,

824
02:11:42,460 --> 02:11:48,260
it looks like fucking slugs. Like, larva. All right, the initial bite was fine.

825
02:11:48,260 --> 02:11:54,649
Uh, after that though. No, these are F. I don't need to take another bite.

826
02:11:54,649 --> 02:11:59,260
But like, what do I, I could decorate a fucking cake with these or something.

827
02:11:59,260 --> 02:12:17,739
That's low F. What do we have for uh, for low F? I think these are the very bottom.

828
02:12:17,739 --> 02:12:25,979
These are below milk dots. These are fucking awful. Those are very bad. Does it really matter? Does

829
02:12:25,979 --> 02:12:36,300
a brand actually matter? Are you going to clean up? Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's only one more candy.

830
02:12:36,300 --> 02:12:49,000
And it's Twizzlers. I'll do, I'll take one quick bite. I know you like these, right? I'll try,

831
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:55,460
I'm going to try a little bit because I have to do it. I can't, those were very bad. These smell bad

832
02:12:55,460 --> 02:13:06,779
too. Yes, they do. They smell like a, like a new coat. Like it smells like, it smells like new shoes.

833
02:13:07,659 --> 02:13:13,430
Why? Why does it smell like a new pair of sneakers? Like a new shoes, like new coat.

834
02:13:13,430 --> 02:13:25,579
Like what the fuck? It's like, it smells like new clothing. It smells like new clothes.

835
02:13:32,409 --> 02:13:54,869
Why are you, I'm just saying it smells like new clothing. New car. Yeah. No, F. Oh my god. No,

836
02:13:54,869 --> 02:14:05,609
that's just bad. They just don't taste good. That's, they're, okay, they're better than the

837
02:14:05,609 --> 02:14:26,899
orange slices. The only thing to do with Twizzlers is this. It's, it's above, they're F. The peelable

838
02:14:26,899 --> 02:14:33,460
Twizzlers are better, way better. No, I don't, yeah, they're F. I knew my mind wasn't going to

839
02:14:33,460 --> 02:14:43,369
change on those at all. Drink the soda? Yeah. I'm not going to ruin a perfectly good Coke.

840
02:14:43,369 --> 02:14:50,869
Why would it, is that what people are actually saying to do that? Wait, this is a, this is a real

841
02:14:50,869 --> 02:15:00,569
thing? What? You drink soda out of a Twizzler. Who does this? You're saying it has to be a Coke,

842
02:15:00,569 --> 02:15:23,000
right? Never doing that again. Never doing that ever again. No, I'm not doing that ever again.

843
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:28,460
All right. There you go. There's your candy. I'm going to, I want to clean up a little bit.

844
02:15:28,460 --> 02:15:34,970
We still have, oh, there's still a decent amount. There's like six or seven more things to do. We

845
02:15:34,970 --> 02:15:40,859
have the chips, which I'm only going to eat like one chip, so we'll be fine. I'm going to go pee.

846
02:15:40,859 --> 02:15:49,609
I'm going to go piss out all this like sugar that I just ate. Uh, yeah, we'll go burp. We're good.

847
02:15:49,609 --> 02:15:53,529
All right. We'll go BRB. I'll be right back. We're going to do chips, clean up a little,

848
02:15:53,529 --> 02:22:31,700
and we'll keep going. Be right back. Okay. Hello. I am back. He's dead. All right. So,

849
02:22:31,700 --> 02:22:44,889
all the sugary stuff is gone. I said that Frank's Red Hog was bad. Oh, I got a little spoon here.

850
02:22:44,889 --> 02:22:49,879
Okay. Well, whatever. All right. So, here's how it's going to work. No, it's fine. It's fine. Oh,

851
02:22:49,879 --> 02:23:01,989
there's play. Okay. Oh, I'm going to do this last because it'll ruin my palette. Chug it. He thinks

852
02:23:01,989 --> 02:23:06,180
these chips don't have sugar. Again, if you're joining us and you don't know what's going on,

853
02:23:06,180 --> 02:23:10,010
people have been joining going, this, what is he doing? This is stupid. This guy sucks.

854
02:23:10,010 --> 02:23:18,620
Listen. So, over the years, I've made tier lists of food, candies, snacks, sodas, and I got everything

855
02:23:18,620 --> 02:23:25,159
that I said was F because I am being an asshole and I'm being biased and I'm going to just face

856
02:23:25,159 --> 02:23:31,879
my own bullshit. Do I actually think sourdough is F? I don't eat this. And we've seen a few

857
02:23:31,879 --> 02:23:38,180
turnarounds. We've seen a couple of major turnarounds. So, let's go. Uh, let's go with this.

858
02:23:40,280 --> 02:23:47,209
Here you go. Here you go, internet. Here you go. Takis, internet. Can't wait. Takis. Oh, dude,

859
02:23:47,209 --> 02:23:52,329
I love Takis. Takis crusted fucking mozzarella sticks. Takis mac and cheese. Oh, dude, imagine

860
02:23:52,329 --> 02:23:56,170
if you ate a Takis and put a macaroni and cheese on it. Here you go, internet. Here you go. Let's go.

861
02:24:02,100 --> 02:24:16,629
Takis. I, I, Trader Joe's makes a version of this that is way better. And look, I just picked up one.

862
02:24:16,629 --> 02:24:27,530
Gotta put it down. I can't go back to work. I have to wash my hands. I ate one. I put one in my mouth.

863
02:24:27,530 --> 02:24:41,770
Yeah, I knew it. You know what it is? Takis? Let's have one more. I would like these more.

864
02:24:44,069 --> 02:24:52,139
I can taste the MSG. MSG has a very specific flavor. It's on Doritos. Like these, like it's

865
02:24:52,139 --> 02:25:04,600
that like Dorito, like umami MSG flavor. I can taste the MSG. Like I know what it tastes like.

866
02:25:04,600 --> 02:25:17,049
It's that very deep, almost like Dorito like flavor. Um, no, I'll be all right. Do they taste

867
02:25:17,049 --> 02:25:26,149
good? I mean, they're, they're, I got the stupid ass blue ones too. Um, you're out of your fucking

868
02:25:26,149 --> 02:25:39,180
mind. MSG is tasty. MSG has that very, like that salty kind of deep like flavor taste. Use chopsticks.

869
02:25:39,180 --> 02:25:45,909
I don't. All right. All right. All right. All right. Let me be, I gotta be fair. These are extreme,

870
02:25:45,909 --> 02:26:00,899
by the way. Be careful. These are extreme. No, it's a fucking potato chip. Relax. I don't like,

871
02:26:00,899 --> 02:26:05,500
I put them in F because you know what? I'm a contrarian dick. And when everybody on the

872
02:26:05,500 --> 02:26:09,260
internet loves something, I go, well, you see, I'd rather have the ones from Trader Joe's.

873
02:26:18,180 --> 02:26:31,659
They're a, see, how am I going to shake your hand? They're a high C. They're a C. They're

874
02:26:31,659 --> 02:26:39,379
okay. It's just like, MSG, I can taste it. I would put them definitely above Red Delicious Apple.

875
02:26:45,059 --> 02:26:54,760
What, you don't want me to do like the thing where I go like worst hand 2022? What the fuck

876
02:26:54,760 --> 02:26:59,139
are you talking about? There's not even a category. Did you drink all this? Did you drink that?

877
02:27:00,739 --> 02:27:05,459
Chat, I know you did. All right. So this is, oh no, I've got talky fingers. Oh, Cheetos, man. Whoa.

878
02:27:06,659 --> 02:27:26,229
Hold on. Dude, I like, my favorite part about eating a potato chip or a corn chip is feeling

879
02:27:26,229 --> 02:27:31,190
like you were blocking yourself from having a bloody nose. Oh, I love it. I love like the,

880
02:27:31,190 --> 02:27:35,510
it's like, oh, I had a bloody nose and I'm running to the bathroom. Like, I love that. It's really

881
02:27:35,510 --> 02:27:52,790
interesting. Here's the funny spaceship blue ones. What's the difference? What's the difference?

882
02:27:52,790 --> 02:28:06,420
What's so funny? Blue ones are better. Do they have MSG? They do. All right. So hold on. These

883
02:28:06,420 --> 02:28:13,500
are blue heat talkies. I put these in F and already, like, I've already, what the fuck, man?

884
02:28:13,500 --> 02:28:45,940
What are these supposed to taste like? What are these supposed to taste like? This is the same.

885
02:28:45,940 --> 02:28:55,290
Yeah. These are like, this is, why make them, why make blue ones? You want to try? They taste

886
02:28:55,290 --> 02:29:00,069
like the same. Is it just like a marketing thing where they're just blue and it's like LOL or

887
02:29:00,069 --> 02:29:19,639
something? I mean, I, how do you feel? You like these? I didn't think I would. I feel like if I

888
02:29:19,639 --> 02:29:22,440
say, oh, wow, there's a difference. Everyone's going to be like, read the ingredients. They're

889
02:29:22,440 --> 02:29:40,629
identical. And I look like an idiot. It's like, it's like, I was fucking drywalling. These are

890
02:29:40,629 --> 02:29:46,680
white boy spice level. What? Cause I coughed? What are you talking about? What? I like coughed for a

891
02:29:46,680 --> 02:30:10,680
second. I need you to hold on. Oh wait, thumbnail. Which one's better? Blue or red? Blue or red?

892
02:30:10,680 --> 02:30:31,340
Which one's better? And, and, and put a bunch of noodles in my mouth. The red ones are like

893
02:30:31,340 --> 02:30:36,809
more acidic. The blue ones are kind of better, but why are they blue? Just make them fucking green.

894
02:30:36,809 --> 02:30:42,739
Why? That would be stupid too. Just make them red. Just call them like talkies, like salt and

895
02:30:42,739 --> 02:30:50,120
pepper or something. I don't know. Hold on a minute guys. I just had a snack. I have to wash

896
02:30:50,120 --> 02:31:03,780
my fucking whole body. I take a shower. Oh, was somebody, did somebody get into the talkies? Oh

897
02:31:03,780 --> 02:31:30,229
no, man. Sure. Don't tell anybody. I'm trying to be sneaky about it. All right. So what's next?

898
02:31:30,229 --> 02:31:38,020
What's next? Oh, okay. Blue is better than red. Uh, but blue, it comes down a half a letter grade

899
02:31:38,020 --> 02:31:42,020
cause they're blue and I don't like it. It's stupid. It's artificial coloring. Uh, red is

900
02:31:42,020 --> 02:31:51,430
artificial coloring too. They both see, but put blue, put them at the same. Who cares? Yeah,

901
02:31:51,430 --> 02:32:04,569
it sounds like it matters. Mom cleaning up after her child. I get blue. I only want to eat blue

902
02:32:04,569 --> 02:32:12,280
foods. No, you can't see blue food. Yes, I can. Oh dude, Frank's red hot. Let's go. All right.

903
02:32:12,840 --> 02:32:17,850
The spice, let's just stay with it. So I put those in F, but they're, they're actually not.

904
02:32:17,850 --> 02:32:24,379
This I have, oh, this is F. I always think this is F. I'm going to end up using this for a fucking

905
02:32:24,379 --> 02:32:35,030
stew or something, right? Eventually. But do I actually think this is that bad? You're an iPad

906
02:32:35,030 --> 02:32:55,670
baby. Okay. Here we go. Ooh, what is this? It's not hot. Frank's, the whole thing about Frank's

907
02:32:55,670 --> 02:33:03,239
red hot is it's heat flavor. It's not like hot, hot. No. If I, if I want to, what's that show

908
02:33:03,239 --> 02:33:08,299
where the guy's like, Hey, so on Instagram, what's it called? Hot ones. And then it's just like,

909
02:33:08,299 --> 02:33:17,299
Oh, we got Frank's red hot here. It'd be like, dude. Okay. Here we go. Frank's red hot. How many

910
02:33:17,299 --> 02:33:51,000
Skullville units? Oh boy. Oh boy. 40. It's all right. It's okay. Where's my ice cream? It's all

911
02:33:51,000 --> 02:34:03,780
right. It's just that I, I would rather have, you know what? Okay. Buffalo sauce like this,

912
02:34:05,620 --> 02:34:11,270
it's the default, just buffalo flavor sauce, which is nothing. There's something wrong with it.

913
02:34:11,270 --> 02:34:16,409
It tastes good. Do you want to try it? Oh, I thought you'd come to try it. I was like,

914
02:34:16,409 --> 02:34:24,809
Oh boy, here it comes. No, it's not hot at all. Okay. I want blue foods and I want milk.

915
02:34:25,370 --> 02:34:35,639
It's got a nice flavor. Sriracha is better. Sriracha is a fucking F. I actually like wanted

916
02:34:35,639 --> 02:34:44,340
to have Sriracha up here, but I was like, I actually hate that and I won't eat it. Um,

917
02:34:44,340 --> 02:34:51,129
the initial bite of Frank's is why you do it. It's the flavor is there. They get,

918
02:34:51,129 --> 02:34:57,290
they became famous with having Frank's red hot be the default buffalo flavor on everything.

919
02:34:57,290 --> 02:35:02,299
And it's, it's, it's good. Actually it's not even that bad. It's really not bad.

920
02:35:02,299 --> 02:35:07,899
It's just so easy to say the thing that is the default sucks. Oh no, it's not this sauce that

921
02:35:07,899 --> 02:35:18,100
I found in a fucking antique shop, right? But I think this is, this is C. I think it belongs at C.

922
02:35:18,100 --> 02:35:26,649
More hot sauces. You want me to do a hot sauce taste test with a Serrano hot sauce, Serrano chili.

923
02:35:27,850 --> 02:35:34,840
I mean, Tabasco is S. I don't even need to taste it. Tabasco is literally S tier.

924
02:35:36,440 --> 02:35:42,170
Tapatio, um, not for another day, another day. I'm going to do it because I feel like I'm going to

925
02:35:42,170 --> 02:35:47,450
have diarrhea later. I don't want it to be like that included. Um, because if I had like, you know,

926
02:35:47,450 --> 02:35:51,850
15 different candies and like 20 different like snacks, I don't want to like have it coated with

927
02:35:51,850 --> 02:36:00,889
like a painful sauce. Um, Tabasco sucks. Get out of here. Get out. Tabasco sucks. Get out. Get out.

928
02:36:00,889 --> 02:36:11,020
Tabasco sucks. Get out. Sriracha is amazing. Your opinion is okay. I just don't like it.

929
02:36:11,020 --> 02:36:18,760
I would rather have Tabasco. Tabasco green sauce. Oh, if you never had it before, it's perfect.

930
02:36:18,760 --> 02:36:26,540
All right. That, we know that. Bugles. I mean, it's kind of hard to put a hot sauce above like

931
02:36:26,540 --> 02:36:33,209
a red delicious apple, right? That doesn't really work that way. Cholula. Tapatio actually I like

932
02:36:33,209 --> 02:36:38,459
more than Cholula. I could, wait, you want to face the bullshit with other stuff too? We can.

933
02:36:38,459 --> 02:36:41,579
Oh, I thought there was a grease on it. I thought there was like, I thought I touched it and it was

934
02:36:41,579 --> 02:36:48,809
like a grease stain. Do you want me to face the bullshit with other stuff? All right. These are

935
02:36:48,809 --> 02:37:10,120
Bugles. These automatically start at A, B because you can do this. That one's broken. I can't.

936
02:37:10,120 --> 02:37:26,569
Never mind. Back down to C to start. Okay. All right. That was, I was unfair. Okay. Wow.

937
02:37:26,569 --> 02:37:39,479
Then what? I gave this F? I gave this F before? Did I put, did I actually put Bugles in F?

938
02:37:39,479 --> 02:37:55,270
I can't believe it. These are very good. Your fingers are too big? No, they changed the recipe.

939
02:37:55,270 --> 02:38:02,809
You can't put your fingers in them anymore. Okay. These, I had an idea of what the flavor was of

940
02:38:02,809 --> 02:38:08,840
Bugles. You know when you have that kind of dream memory of like the tasting a certain way

941
02:38:09,399 --> 02:38:13,860
and it tastes like that in real life, but it's like a 10 times better version than what you

942
02:38:13,860 --> 02:38:22,739
remembered because I would, these were like, ew, that gross Bugle flavor. But now that I eat them,

943
02:38:22,739 --> 02:38:36,229
these are really good. I'm very surprised. These are just Fritos, but lighter and like more delicious.

944
02:38:36,229 --> 02:38:50,149
Shit, man. This is bad. These were, these are going from F to A. These are really good.

945
02:38:50,149 --> 02:38:57,909
America's number one finger, finger hat. Let's put that false advertising. False advertising.

946
02:39:00,010 --> 02:39:20,040
I can't fit my finger in there. False advertising for kids. Adults aren't supposed to care about

947
02:39:20,040 --> 02:39:36,440
that. That's true. You're right. All right. Coke is an S. Bring it down to A. Oh, fun difference

948
02:39:36,440 --> 02:39:49,399
is S. Holy shit. Yeah. These are an A. Yep. This is an A. I could eat this whole bag. I could eat

949
02:39:49,399 --> 02:39:56,069
that whole bag. Bugles. What a surprise. What a twist. What a twist. Oh my God. In the beginning

950
02:39:56,069 --> 02:40:02,180
of the video, you, you guys have no idea the twist. Like I changed like four F's.

951
02:40:02,899 --> 02:40:08,340
Keep watching to find out what they are. Chili cheese Fritos.

952
02:40:10,520 --> 02:40:17,100
I know. These are dog shit. And they have Bugle, they have Bugleberries in the title.

953
02:40:20,920 --> 02:40:31,340
Okay. Chili cheese Fritos. It's not that chili cheese Fritos taste bad. They're just too intense.

954
02:40:31,340 --> 02:40:38,020
They're just like too much. Fritos are fine, but it's just like, it's like too. Remember when they

955
02:40:38,020 --> 02:40:41,860
did the like ketchup and mustard fucking potato chips. It's just like, that's, I don't want that.

956
02:40:41,860 --> 02:40:48,870
It's like too much weird shit on it. Oh my God. These are F. F. F. Oh my God. These are bad.

957
02:40:49,590 --> 02:41:01,590
These are fucking terrible. No way. It's like barbecue mixed with like chili. I don't know.

958
02:41:02,309 --> 02:41:26,649
These are bad. It's just like way too intense and deep. It's just too much. Hold on. Hold on. Hold

959
02:41:26,649 --> 02:41:44,520
on. Hold on. You know, sometimes you just get one that has way too much powder on it and you,

960
02:41:44,520 --> 02:41:51,079
and it just tastes like a fucking bowl of chili for like a quarter of a second. And I don't like

961
02:41:51,079 --> 02:42:43,750
it. You didn't shake the bag first. Oh, I missed. They're uh, I don't like them, but I keep eating

962
02:42:43,750 --> 02:42:48,790
them. They're like a C. They're not F. They're just like too much. It's just too intense.

963
02:42:48,790 --> 02:42:54,200
Too many different flavors. Just too many flavors. There's just too many flavors and too much dust.

964
02:42:57,620 --> 02:43:02,329
You got to hear the crunch. Oh yeah. You're right. Crunch test. Crunch test. Crunch test. You're

965
02:43:02,329 --> 02:43:08,790
right. Crunch test. I'm going to say eat the one on the ground. Was that the one from the ground?

966
02:43:08,790 --> 02:43:35,219
No. Um, this is C. C. All right. Washing hands. Christy, also keep in mind, anything that is D plus

967
02:43:35,219 --> 02:43:40,860
or higher, I'm going to eat the whole bag. So like these chili cheese fritos, they're going to get

968
02:43:40,860 --> 02:43:45,659
rolled up and I'll eat the whole thing. I'll eat the whole thing. I know that she'll have some too.

969
02:43:46,860 --> 02:43:58,739
Okay. Uh, what do we got? Oh, kettle cooked sea salt and uh, salt and vinegar chips.

970
02:44:02,809 --> 02:44:10,010
Farm to smiles. Farm potatoes. Real potatoes. Real farmers. Delicious chips.

971
02:44:11,219 --> 02:44:19,350
Carefully crafted for you. Shake the bag. Oh yeah. This, everyone had talked a lot of shit.

972
02:44:19,989 --> 02:44:25,659
These are God tier to a lot of you. S tier. God tier. I think that salt and vinegar chips are

973
02:44:25,659 --> 02:44:30,139
gross. I haven't eaten them in five years, at least. But I'm going to do it for you right now

974
02:44:30,139 --> 02:44:34,250
and you're going to get a library action. And make sure you stay tuned to find out what I felt

975
02:44:34,250 --> 02:44:47,030
about the trolleys. They smell pretty good. You want some? So you, you really like these.

976
02:44:47,030 --> 02:44:54,489
Oh, you haven't, have you ever had them? Have you ever had salt and vinegar chips? All right, here

977
02:44:54,489 --> 02:45:17,180
we go. They just taste like chips. That's something wrong with them. Like, yeah, I mean, but it tastes

978
02:45:17,180 --> 02:45:28,780
like, it tastes like chips where there's something wrong with them. I would rather just have them be

979
02:45:28,780 --> 02:45:48,040
salt. Are they F though? I feel that's maybe not fair. I have a pregnant palate. Excuse me?

980
02:45:48,040 --> 02:45:55,909
Oh. Oh, how do you figure I have a pregnant palate? What do you mean? I'm not eating like

981
02:45:55,909 --> 02:46:07,049
ice cream and hot dogs. What are you talking about? They're D. These are D. I just, I would

982
02:46:07,049 --> 02:46:18,739
rather than just be sea salt. Yeah. I want these to be sea salt. They just put a bunch of like

983
02:46:18,739 --> 02:46:30,840
sour stuff all over them. They're D. They leveled up from F, but no, not into it. The bugles though.

984
02:46:30,840 --> 02:46:38,440
Holy shit. I want to eat more of those. All right, here we go. A couple of years ago,

985
02:46:39,139 --> 02:46:52,940
what I'm enjoying. A couple of years ago, I put sun chips in F and I literally lost like

986
02:46:52,940 --> 02:47:00,969
5,000 subs in a day. I lost 20,000 followers. I lost a thousand subs over the course of like

987
02:47:00,969 --> 02:47:07,000
every day because people said that it's insane that you put those there. People said it's crazy

988
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:13,190
that you don't like these. And even my girlfriend is like, I don't understand that. They're just

989
02:47:13,190 --> 02:47:20,069
plain. It's like a corn chip, but like I was plain. It's just too plain. They're way too

990
02:47:20,069 --> 02:47:25,700
plain for me. Way too plain. Yeah, but there's a middle ground. There's like a way too much.

991
02:47:25,700 --> 02:47:30,420
And then there's like bland nothing flavor. You got to have the perfect amount of spice.

992
02:47:31,350 --> 02:47:35,979
These, I don't know. We'll see because I put those there too. Those are in F. They're just,

993
02:47:35,979 --> 02:47:40,920
they kind of just taste like nothing. They're just a kind of weird like grain. But again,

994
02:47:41,639 --> 02:47:50,459
I have not had a sun chip in at least five, at least five years. First of all, the bag is wicked

995
02:47:50,459 --> 02:48:07,610
loud. You're going to wake up your roommate in college, bro. Boring ass bullshit. No, yeah.

996
02:48:07,610 --> 02:48:13,670
Bugles are better. No, these are, these are fucking, why are you like these? These are just

997
02:48:13,670 --> 02:48:25,370
better. These are way better. These are better in every way. They're like 100% whole grain.

998
02:48:28,489 --> 02:48:42,309
It's 100% whole grain. But like, this is just like the corn flakes of chips. I mean in a bag

999
02:48:42,309 --> 02:48:55,940
of corn flakes. 100% whole grain, heart healthy. No artificial flavors are preservatives. And 30%

1000
02:48:55,940 --> 02:49:02,420
less fat than regular potato chips. You know what else has 30% less fat than regular potato chips?

1001
02:49:02,420 --> 02:49:14,280
Baked lays. Which baked lays are S tier. Baked lays are omega S tier. This is cope and seething.

1002
02:49:18,219 --> 02:49:23,110
The garden veggie. I mean these were very highly rated too. I'm telling you, I'm not,

1003
02:49:23,110 --> 02:49:28,329
I'm just giving my real opinion. Are these F? Am I going to piss everybody off by actually eating

1004
02:49:28,329 --> 02:49:37,239
these and saying they're F on camera? How do you get the raw, these are, these are just like

1005
02:49:37,879 --> 02:49:47,799
sun chip original flavor. I want garden salsa. I want garden salsa. No, this is, this is,

1006
02:49:47,799 --> 02:50:09,270
this is it. I don't want another one. F. Not into it. All right. French onion. These were very

1007
02:50:09,270 --> 02:50:39,930
highly rated. Incredibly highly rated. Smells much better. This is French onion garden grain.

1008
02:50:39,930 --> 02:50:55,989
All right. 10 times better. I would say a hundred times better. Remember 2,000 people left.

1009
02:50:55,989 --> 02:51:07,299
Yeah. Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy your fucking like bland ass chips. These are actually pretty good. These

1010
02:51:07,299 --> 02:51:14,090
are really good. That's what I mean. You gotta give me something. I don't want to just eat like

1011
02:51:14,090 --> 02:51:28,120
fucking corn. Is it S? What were these A? Ingredients. Demented yellow, de-germed yellow corn meal.

1012
02:51:28,120 --> 02:51:37,610
Yeah. These suck. They don't. These are better. This is, let me show you on camera. These are made

1013
02:51:37,610 --> 02:51:42,409
from the same material. These are made from the same material. This one was made by From Software.

1014
02:51:42,409 --> 02:51:50,680
This one was made by, what's a game company that everybody hates? This one was made, can I say,

1015
02:51:50,760 --> 02:52:00,600
but I better be careful. This one, this one was made by, I was gonna say, what's like a,

1016
02:52:02,809 --> 02:52:12,309
I don't know, this one was made by Blizzard, Ubisoft. No, Capcom makes good games. I didn't

1017
02:52:12,309 --> 02:52:16,790
really like Watch Dogs Legion, so I'm gonna say Ubisoft. I didn't, that game was not very good.

1018
02:52:17,670 --> 02:52:21,110
This one was made by From Software. This one was made by a game company that you don't like,

1019
02:52:21,110 --> 02:52:31,290
whatever that is. The same material. These are good. Why am I so afraid to say that when I like

1020
02:52:31,290 --> 02:52:40,649
yell about these, how much I don't like some of these games? They, this does it right. Not a whole

1021
02:52:40,649 --> 02:52:49,260
lot of sweetness. Not a whole lot of spice. Not a whole lot of salt. This is a B. These are B. These

1022
02:52:49,260 --> 02:52:59,500
are actually good. These are very good. I was wrong. Yeah. These are B. You're weak. Nobody likes

1023
02:52:59,500 --> 02:53:05,979
plain chips, but as I'm saying, like these are, it's just plain. I don't want to eat those. I

1024
02:53:05,979 --> 02:53:13,340
actually don't want to eat these. I would rather eat one of Otto's Milk Bones than one of these.

1025
02:53:13,340 --> 02:53:26,149
These are pork rinds, but what if I'm a, what if I'm full of shit? I'm, I could be full of

1026
02:53:26,149 --> 02:53:29,750
shit. Am I full of shit though? I have, I feel like I just pretend like I don't like these. That's the

1027
02:53:29,750 --> 02:53:40,649
whole point of the stream. The whole point of this show, this television show. Hmm? They're just like

1028
02:53:40,649 --> 02:53:51,799
pork skin, pork rinds. Right, right. I put these at F. Dermot, you're a bad streamer. I was gonna give

1029
02:53:51,799 --> 02:54:09,530
you the finger, but I'm gonna be the bigger man. Hot sauce? On these? Yeah, grab it. I can't even

1030
02:54:09,530 --> 02:54:34,979
open them. I proved him right. What do you mean? Okay. I don't, don't come over here.

1031
02:54:37,780 --> 02:54:45,159
Just don't, I'm telling you, you don't want to be here. No, I didn't fart. No, I didn't.

1032
02:54:51,770 --> 02:55:16,709
I'm just going to get a little one. That's a huge one. Pork rinds. Why? It's, it's fucking,

1033
02:55:16,709 --> 02:55:30,219
it's probably delicious. Why am I acting like there's a bug in my hand? This is bacon. It's

1034
02:55:30,219 --> 02:55:41,850
just like literally like bacon. It's just bacon chips. Very dry. Let's try it with the good old

1035
02:55:41,850 --> 02:56:10,700
Tapatio. They smelled awful. And I mean like really bad. Are you saying what, like a drop or two?

1036
02:56:10,700 --> 02:56:26,629
Hmm. Hmm. I mean, the smell is truly awful. Like it smells, out of everything we've opened today,

1037
02:56:26,629 --> 02:56:36,680
by far this stinks. I don't know why it came out. It sounds so weird, but it's really not good.

1038
02:56:36,680 --> 02:56:42,659
They're very dry. Yeah, they're very dry, but a little bit of the Tapatio. It was like just

1039
02:56:42,659 --> 02:56:52,709
kind of bacon. That was, that was kind of good. One more, one more, one more. I don't, I like,

1040
02:56:52,709 --> 02:57:02,219
don't like it, but it's like, I don't know. I kind of, I could see this being really good.

1041
02:57:02,219 --> 02:57:13,459
I don't know. Maybe like crushed up. The smell will go away. Holly, we're going to be sleeping

1042
02:57:13,459 --> 02:57:22,620
in different rooms tonight. That's good. That's good. I'm not going, I can't lie to you and be

1043
02:57:22,620 --> 02:57:31,139
like, oh pork rinds. I fucking hate being on camera. They're definitely not F, but they're

1044
02:57:31,139 --> 02:57:34,860
definitely not higher than like a D plus. Maybe like a C minus or something. What's the, what's

1045
02:57:34,860 --> 02:57:46,940
the height? What's the highest thing in D? Salt and vinegar chips better than that. Where's red

1046
02:57:46,940 --> 02:58:10,620
delicious apple? Right in the middle. Almond Joy. I'd rather have an Almond Joy. All right. Here we

1047
02:58:10,620 --> 02:58:19,319
go. It's hard. I mean, it's hard to do hot sauce. I mean, this is better than Frank's. But you know,

1048
02:58:19,319 --> 02:58:26,489
Tapatio, you want a good little bit of spice on your, on your whatever it is. This is the,

1049
02:58:26,489 --> 02:58:31,750
this is the best stuff you want. You want to face the bullshit. I will face the bullshit. This and

1050
02:58:31,750 --> 02:58:39,719
Tabasco are the best hot sauces you can buy at the grocery store. Tapatio. Trust me. You're going to

1051
02:58:39,719 --> 02:58:53,180
want it. Hey, Tapatio. Good till it's gone. Actually, you know what? Let's go. I love this

1052
02:58:53,180 --> 02:58:58,739
stuff. It's so good on tacos. It's so good. But you can go to everything. Hey, hey, hey, hey. So,

1053
02:58:58,739 --> 02:59:08,090
it's so good. I put it on my ice cream. You know what I mean? It's very good. It's just,

1054
02:59:08,090 --> 02:59:19,139
it's just vinegar. No, it's not. That was not based. Okay. So we're, we're almost done. We've

1055
02:59:19,139 --> 02:59:29,299
got cashews and bread. If I would, if I got a blood test right now, they would probably think

1056
02:59:29,299 --> 02:59:35,079
I was from like an alien planet. What's going on with your levels? They're all fucked up. What

1057
02:59:35,079 --> 02:59:43,260
did you do? Ooh, that was a, did you see the freshness? Did you get a look at that freshness?

1058
02:59:43,260 --> 02:59:52,540
That was fresh, but they're cashews. So they're disgusting. I fucking hate these. I actually hate

1059
02:59:52,540 --> 02:59:58,219
cashews. I think they're the worst. They're just like meaty, like too like, they're just like,

1060
02:59:58,219 --> 03:00:06,809
it's just like, it's like gamey. It's like cashews are like the venison of the peanut world. There's

1061
03:00:06,809 --> 03:00:32,020
like two, there's too much. Here we go. Oh my God. I was so wrong. Wait, I just, I don't like,

1062
03:00:32,020 --> 03:00:52,340
I just don't like them. I just don't like them. I don't like the shape either. Telling you.

1063
03:00:52,340 --> 03:00:57,209
Eat these instead. It's the same shit. This is made out of cornmeal. This is made out of fucking

1064
03:00:57,209 --> 03:01:03,370
gross nuts. No, I mean, they're different. These are made out of completely, this is way better.

1065
03:01:03,370 --> 03:01:11,610
That's D minus. What's, what's at the bottom of D? Okay. Would I rather have cashews or red

1066
03:01:11,610 --> 03:01:22,440
delicious, red delicious? I would rather eat five red delicious apples before I had 10 of those.

1067
03:01:22,440 --> 03:01:28,680
I know I'm crazy. No, I don't like this. The flavors just doesn't, it's just not good.

1068
03:01:28,680 --> 03:01:48,790
This is not good. Okay. That's all the snacks. It is time for bread. We're going to start with

1069
03:01:48,790 --> 03:01:56,569
butter bread. I never had it. People said, dude, you're fucking crazy. I'm just going to try a

1070
03:01:56,569 --> 03:02:03,620
little bit. Um, no, this is fine. I'm just going to take a little bit. I have whole wheat bread here.

1071
03:02:03,620 --> 03:02:13,299
Gross. And I have sourdough here. Even grosser. Butter bread. I'm not going to eat a shitload of

1072
03:02:13,299 --> 03:02:21,100
it. I'm just going to have like a little piece. Dude, the zip ties are the USB sticks of the food

1073
03:02:21,100 --> 03:02:25,819
world. I, you, I don't, you know, I'm never going the right way. Like I can never get it right the

1074
03:02:25,819 --> 03:02:36,180
first way. Wrong brand. What are you talking about? It's just freaking default bread. Wrong

1075
03:02:36,180 --> 03:02:51,540
brand, Andy. All right. I finally get it off. Okay. This is butter bread. Wrong brand. Here is a

1076
03:02:51,540 --> 03:02:55,459
piece of butter bread. I've done, I've never eaten this and I was like, I don't want it. It sounds

1077
03:02:55,459 --> 03:03:13,559
gross. Enjoy the glucose. You idiot. Thanks doc. Butter bread. Why'd you take the third slice?

1078
03:03:13,559 --> 03:03:21,610
I don't know. No, we're doing this default. I'm not going to play into your horse shit.

1079
03:03:21,610 --> 03:03:25,290
No, what you do, you didn't dip it in, in like butter, put it in the toaster oven,

1080
03:03:25,290 --> 03:03:29,129
let it sit for an hour, cut it in half, put a little bit of sugar on it. No, no, no, no, no,

1081
03:03:29,129 --> 03:03:32,489
no, no, no. We're eating this as it is. You're not going to, you're not going to do any bullshit on

1082
03:03:32,489 --> 03:04:02,200
me. Here we go. Butter bread. Sweet. It's sweet. Sugary. It's like a nice sweetness. It does kind

1083
03:04:02,200 --> 03:04:09,100
of taste like, like a little buttery. This is really good sandwich bread. Yeah. Like I could see

1084
03:04:09,100 --> 03:04:14,700
like, like a big, like a nice slab of ham on there. Nice slab of fucking Swiss cheese. Nice slab of

1085
03:04:14,700 --> 03:04:24,680
fucking mustard. Oh yeah. I could see it. A nice like ham sandwich with this. I think it'd be pretty

1086
03:04:24,680 --> 03:04:36,899
good. This is like, this is high. It's kind of like just like a better version of white bread.

1087
03:04:36,899 --> 03:04:48,790
What is this? What is this stuff? What is this? What is this? How do they get it to taste like

1088
03:04:48,790 --> 03:04:57,020
this? Is it just butter? A slab of mustard? Yeah. I think this is like, this is like a B.

1089
03:04:57,020 --> 03:05:05,670
This isn't, you don't even need to put butter on this. I'm telling you. Put this in the toast

1090
03:05:05,670 --> 03:05:09,979
oven. Light toast. Don't even put butter on it. I think it's fine. You don't even need it.

1091
03:05:13,690 --> 03:05:24,219
I'm just, that's a solid B. Nobody can have this. It's mine. Nobody can have any of this.

1092
03:05:24,219 --> 03:05:33,540
All right. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. What do you think? Like, hey, how do you do it? Fold it over,

1093
03:05:33,540 --> 03:05:45,370
set it down. That's how I do it. It's glucose. Glucose Andy. All right. I know I'm not going to

1094
03:05:45,370 --> 03:05:51,620
like this, but whatever. This is whole wheat bread. I got the wrong brand. Sorry. I didn't

1095
03:05:51,620 --> 03:06:00,069
get your like craft beer bread brand. I had literally like less than 24 hours to get all this.

1096
03:06:00,069 --> 03:06:06,200
Dude, you didn't, you didn't get like the, the craft, like micro brew beer, whatever. It's,

1097
03:06:06,200 --> 03:06:14,309
it's bread. This is a hundred percent whole wheat and it's going to be enough. Let's take a look at

1098
03:06:14,309 --> 03:06:29,370
the cola. Pretty nice. Pretty nice marbling. Color is there. That's definitely wheat bread.

1099
03:06:29,370 --> 03:06:42,180
IPA millennial bread. Yeah. It's definitely wheat. It's whole wheat. It's definitely is.

1100
03:06:42,180 --> 03:06:54,250
Let's hold on. Let's. Yep. Okay. The aroma that comes out. There we go. I already know what this

1101
03:06:54,250 --> 03:07:21,190
is going to taste like and I don't like it. It's communion bread. It's just bread, dude. Why are

1102
03:07:21,190 --> 03:07:27,540
you eating it like this? That's the worst sourdough I've ever seen. This is not sourdough. We haven't

1103
03:07:27,540 --> 03:07:35,270
even opened the sourdough yet. This is not sourdough. It's just bread. Who, yeah, who gives a shit about

1104
03:07:35,270 --> 03:07:40,569
any of this? Who gives a shit about any of what you're watching? Who gives a shit about this?

1105
03:07:40,569 --> 03:07:49,319
Oh, a white bread is better than wheat bread is better than sourdough. Who cares? But this is bad.

1106
03:07:50,760 --> 03:07:58,659
F. I just bit my lip. It's F. It's just F. I whole wheat bread just is so plain. Is it? Okay.

1107
03:08:00,180 --> 03:08:06,520
These are the same. These are the same in my brain. It's so plain. It's plain and just like

1108
03:08:07,799 --> 03:08:13,780
cardboardy. These are the same. I don't like whole wheat bread. I don't like whole wheat chips, whole

1109
03:08:13,780 --> 03:08:19,540
grain. No, give me some flavoring. Get that goddamn fucking fucked up B to come over and sprinkle

1110
03:08:19,540 --> 03:08:27,239
the honey on my Cheerios. Like, I need something. It can't just be plain. Here's the sourdough.

1111
03:08:27,239 --> 03:08:37,260
And this is, this is, this is Grandma's, Grandma Sycamore's homemade bread. You better be fucking

1112
03:08:37,260 --> 03:08:49,750
nice to Grandma, all right? Or I better be. Dude, Grandma Sycamore's sourdough. It was the wrong

1113
03:08:49,750 --> 03:09:09,989
brand. There's no right brands of bread. Grandma, Grandma Sycamore. This is Grandma baked every

1114
03:09:09,989 --> 03:09:24,280
single one of these. Don't you get it? Sourdough. That's definitely sourdough. That is definitely

1115
03:09:24,280 --> 03:09:34,649
sourdough. All right. This is the last thing I'm eating. This is the last one. She's looking over

1116
03:09:34,649 --> 03:09:50,040
here. She loves this shit. She's a huge fan of Grandma Sycamore. I know it's not like the, dude,

1117
03:09:50,040 --> 03:10:02,389
doesn't have like the Swiss cheese holes. It's, I had fucking 24 hours. Yeah, that's all right.

1118
03:10:03,659 --> 03:10:11,020
It's just like, it's just bugs all over it. It's fine. All right, here we go. Sourdough sandwich

1119
03:10:11,020 --> 03:10:19,690
bread from Grandma Sycamore. Actually pretty, the thing I fucking hate about sourdough is it's like

1120
03:10:19,690 --> 03:10:47,670
made out of glue. Go to the bakery and buy, yeah, all right, Bakery Andy. Hey, Grandma, you got a

1121
03:10:47,670 --> 03:10:58,860
good thing here. It's good. It's not like that super heavy like sourdough, like, like sour flavor.

1122
03:10:58,860 --> 03:11:15,739
It's good. It's good. Grandma, am I wrong? You gave it to, somebody said I gave it to you like

1123
03:11:15,739 --> 03:11:21,879
I was feeding a duck. Grandma went fucking sycamore mode for this because I don't really like sourdough

1124
03:11:21,879 --> 03:11:29,959
and this is, this is pretty good. This would like a say, like it's got like that, it's light. Who

1125
03:11:29,959 --> 03:11:45,579
made this? Grandma Sycamore homemade bread. Hold on a minute. Grandma Sycamore's homemade bread has a

1126
03:11:45,579 --> 03:11:54,700
fresh baked homestyle taste and texture your family will love. True. Our breads are made without

1127
03:11:54,700 --> 03:12:00,299
artificial preservatives, colors, or high fructose corn syrup. Just ingredients you can trust.

1128
03:12:00,299 --> 03:12:05,989
Actually you can trust Grandma Sycamore mode. Give our breads a try and you'll see why we believe

1129
03:12:05,989 --> 03:12:16,250
that nothing compares to Grandma Sycamore's. It has that like sour sourdough flavor but it's not

1130
03:12:16,250 --> 03:12:22,069
like fucking tough as goddamn nails. That's why I don't like sourdough. You're holding the bread

1131
03:12:22,069 --> 03:12:32,979
like a baby? I was reading this. All right, Grandma Sycamore. Grandma Sycamore. All right,

1132
03:12:32,979 --> 03:12:39,819
stop saying that. Grandma Sycamore, that's a, all right, I'm biased because I don't like sourdough.

1133
03:12:39,819 --> 03:12:46,180
So remember, like a C plus for me for sourdough might be like a B or an A for you but I'm not a

1134
03:12:46,180 --> 03:12:53,659
big fan of sourdough but Grandma Sycamore didn't miss. That's a C plus. I actually, I actually did

1135
03:12:53,659 --> 03:12:59,590
not, I will probably have a sandwich for this later. That's, okay, you know what I'm talking

1136
03:12:59,590 --> 03:13:08,870
about? Like that sourdough flavor is there but not like the chewy sourdough toughness. Grandma,

1137
03:13:08,870 --> 03:13:33,590
pretty good, pretty good. Oh, let me see. Undip, Coke, yep, 7% battery power. All right, Red Hot

1138
03:13:33,590 --> 03:13:39,239
is not rated but Red Hot like doesn't, I don't know, doesn't need to be. All right, I think,

1139
03:13:39,239 --> 03:13:46,459
what, what stayed an F? It looks like Sun Chips stayed an F, Swedish Fish, Wheat Bread, Tootsie

1140
03:13:46,459 --> 03:13:56,729
Rolls, the Honeydew Melon, yeah, yeah. I thought that was an avocado. Jelly Beans, yeah, the

1141
03:13:57,290 --> 03:14:01,049
Butter Jelly Beans are gross. Grapefruit is still gonna stay down. The Mountain Dew is down there,

1142
03:14:01,690 --> 03:14:09,959
this makes sense to me. Surprises though, we have a few surprises. Bugles, Big Twist, I really,

1143
03:14:09,959 --> 03:14:14,360
I thought I hated those. Those were all the way up to A. Fun Dip, I thought was like a disgusting

1144
03:14:14,360 --> 03:14:21,590
thing for children. In fact, adults can enjoy it too but you can't bring that to the office.

1145
03:14:21,590 --> 03:14:32,489
Fun Dip is at S. Bugles went up to A. Yeah, these were, these were good, the Sun Chips. I would

1146
03:14:32,489 --> 03:14:45,690
definitely put the bread, put the Sun Chips above the bread and then put the Green Sun Chips. I

1147
03:14:45,690 --> 03:14:52,840
think this is good. Fritos. Whoppers went up too. Whoppers went up from F. I'm actually pretty,

1148
03:14:52,840 --> 03:15:00,260
I'm pretty surprised by some of this. Mike and Ike said, those were F too. No, Butter, put

1149
03:15:00,260 --> 03:15:06,579
Butter Bread at C. Definitely put Butter Bread behind Grandma because I mean, there's no way that's

1150
03:15:06,579 --> 03:15:21,420
better. Yeah, I knew that I still wasn't gonna like Swedish Fish or Tootsie Rolls. You're an iPad kid.

1151
03:15:21,420 --> 03:15:27,350
Well, there, there you have it. There, you wanna get, you wanna come grab your phone? There you go.

1152
03:15:27,350 --> 03:15:34,420
Hold it that way. Okay, all right. No, Otto. Otto's just been chilling here the whole time.

1153
03:15:35,129 --> 03:15:40,569
He's just, he's like, I'm eating like bread and stuff and he's just like, like, no, you're not

1154
03:15:40,569 --> 03:15:47,639
getting any of this. What about the Frank's Red Hot? I mean, that's, I, it's hard. You can't like

1155
03:15:47,639 --> 03:15:55,799
put, it's hard to put hot sauce here. That has to be a whole another day. Okay, so in the chat,

1156
03:15:55,799 --> 03:16:01,500
on a scale of one to 10, 10 being, this was a really fun stream. You should do it again.

1157
03:16:01,500 --> 03:16:06,360
And one being, I accidentally clicked on your stream and I'm never coming back. What, where was,

1158
03:16:06,360 --> 03:16:09,750
how do you feel about this? Do you want to see more of this? Would you like to see more of these

1159
03:16:09,750 --> 03:16:22,680
kind of weird taste test streams? Okay. Seen a lot of eights, a lot of sevens, a lot of nines.

1160
03:16:22,680 --> 03:16:33,930
Seen some tens. Seen some tens. Nine, three. Oh, cool. All right. Well, I'm gonna clean up.

1161
03:16:33,930 --> 03:16:40,170
That's it. That's the end of the stream. Thanks for watching. There's a lot of food now. The pantry

1162
03:16:40,170 --> 03:16:45,799
is gonna be full of food for like a year. I actually enjoyed these as much as I pretend like

1163
03:16:45,799 --> 03:16:51,290
I don't. They're actually better. I just wish they weren't blue because why are they blue?

1164
03:16:51,290 --> 03:17:00,540
Very cool. Very cool. Very excited. I'm very excited. Really? Okay. Maybe we'll do like some

1165
03:17:00,540 --> 03:17:05,459
more taste testing eventually here. That was a lot of fun. I had a good time. I'm not clapping. I'm

1166
03:17:05,459 --> 03:17:11,190
not clapping because like I did a good job. I'm clapping because there's like shit all over me.

1167
03:17:11,190 --> 03:17:20,180
I kind of want to eat more of this grandma bread. Does this hit the ground? Very good. All right.

1168
03:17:20,180 --> 03:17:25,239
Well, I got some stuff going on this weekend so I won't be around. When I come back, I'll be around

1169
03:17:25,239 --> 03:17:34,860
on Tuesday? No, Tuesday. On Tuesday, we're going to do blood wash and murder house. So he's clapping

1170
03:17:34,860 --> 03:17:46,069
his ass cheeks. Where's Monster Rancher? I don't know. Grandma went sicko mode. All right. I'll

1171
03:17:46,069 --> 03:17:51,319
see you guys later. That's it. I'll see you guys on Tuesday. Thanks for watching. The nature of

1172
03:17:51,319 --> 03:17:56,100
this stream. I kind of need to just go to the outro. So I'm going to clean up and make sure

1173
03:17:56,100 --> 03:17:59,639
nothing's on the ground for auto so I don't eat anything. So I'll see you guys later. See you

1174
03:17:59,639 --> 03:18:08,620
Tuesday. I'll come over there. I'll see you Tuesday. Thanks for watching everybody. See you soon.

1175
03:18:08,870 --> 03:18:17,909
Tuesday at four o'clock. Can you hear me? Tuesday at four o'clock tonight.

1176
03:18:17,909 --> 03:19:51,659
And thank Holly for helping because that I couldn't have done this alone.
