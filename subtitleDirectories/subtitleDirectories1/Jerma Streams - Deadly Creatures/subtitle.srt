00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:07,780
Hello, good afternoon. How are you doing? Are you doing good? Good. Peaceful Haley, thanks to the

2
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:14,519
six community subs right now. I'd like to welcome you away. You welcome, you can welcome me back.

3
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:24,789
I'll welcome you back at the same time. Ready? Welcome back. What are you guys saying shoo for?

4
00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:29,750
Shoo, shoo. Right, right, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I can't fucking make a joke on Twitter.

5
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:38,149
Not allowed to make a joke on Twitter. That's what that was about. I mean, no, no, no, no, no.

6
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:49,320
Season premiere. I am not going to eat a shoo. Like, at this point, the shoo thing is,

7
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:56,039
that's like a channel joke at this point. That's a channel meme at this point. It doesn't, it doesn't

8
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,439
mean anything. It's, I'm not actually going to do that. If you think I'm actually going to do that,

9
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:08,329
then come on. You lied again. I didn't lie about anything. It's a, we make jokes on this comedy

10
00:01:08,329 --> 00:01:20,840
stream. That's unfunny. Unfunny riot, right? We trusted you. Just what? Hold on. Comrad Castro,

11
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:29,959
thanks for the five. Community subs, appreciate it. You make a statement about fucking sans in

12
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:45,030
Smash Brothers. One day I'm going to unsub from you. Jeff, one day I'm going to unsub from you.

13
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:55,269
God damn it. Oh God. Can we please get over this? Guys, as a community, can we? All right, hold on.

14
00:01:56,150 --> 00:02:06,939
Can we please? Can we get over this as a community, please? Why is it so big? Why,

15
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:17,900
I look professional right now. That shouldn't be happening. Nice hair. I can't get a haircut.

16
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:23,750
I was actually thinking about this. I was thinking about going and I was going to have Kim do this

17
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:37,979
for me. Oh shit, I moved that wrong way. Can we get over this shit though? Please? Yes, I'm still

18
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:45,099
in the old place, but I got news for you. Every place in Vegas, whether it's an apartment, a house

19
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:57,449
or a condo is the same house. They only make like three different places out here. When eventually

20
00:02:57,449 --> 00:03:01,210
I'm in a new place, you're going to be like, oh shit, that looks, I'm not even going to tell

21
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:11,819
you when I move. You'll have to figure it out. Squeegee? Why are people saying squeegee? I know

22
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:17,639
there's a delay. There should be because we're about to play the Wii. We had a pre-stream chat

23
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:26,389
vote, but it shouldn't be delayed. Hold on. Let me do this. I mean, it's going to look, it's going

24
00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:32,139
to look a little different for the first few minutes. It's delayed. You look sleepy? It's

25
00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:40,710
because I am. It's because I am. I got like a fucking weird neck. It's an extreme delay. Shoo,

26
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:53,990
shoo, shoo. I, I, we gotta, I'm, I'm, get it off! Is that what you want? Can we get over this, please?

27
00:03:54,710 --> 00:04:00,460
Can we get over this shit, please? If you think I'm going to eat this, you're out of your fucking

28
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:13,300
mind. Yeah, I'll take, can I take a bite and will you guys get over this? If I take a bite of this,

29
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:46,089
will you get over it? It's not as bad as I thought it was going to be. It tastes kind of like shit

30
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:59,000
though. Wait a minute. I'm not even stepping shit. Relax. It was a joke. Okay. I'll take,

31
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:16,470
should I take another bite of this shoe? This fucking shoe? I can't believe it. Eat the bottom.

32
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:21,269
I'm not going to eat the bottom of the shoe. I'm going to eat, I'm going to do, I'm going to do it

33
00:05:21,269 --> 00:05:35,769
the way that I want to do it, not the way that you want me to do it. You can't eat a whole shoe

34
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:55,699
in five seconds. Holy shit, guys. Put it back on. I can't put it on. Not yet. I can't put it on.

35
00:05:55,699 --> 00:06:06,250
Come on. I'm going to try over here. Wear the socks. It's fucking winter time. You don't wear

36
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:32,579
socks. Fucking Sans. It should never have been in the game. It's not even a Nintendo character.

37
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:36,740
If Sans is in Smash Brothers now, then Scrooge McDuck better be next week.

38
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:54,709
I don't need any more shoes for new characters. Strong teeth? No, these are special shoes.

39
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:07,620
No, my shoes are made out of fucking cotton. I have very dainty, I have very sensitive feet.

40
00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:30,139
So they need to be put into these comfy shoes. This is gross. But you have to be a man of your

41
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:46,069
word. And I'm a man of my word. Should I put it back on? One more from the bottom?

42
00:07:54,060 --> 00:08:18,009
He's a starving crack addict. No, I'm a man of my shoe eating word. Oh, it's not good. Oh,

43
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:24,620
sorry. Oh, I got some shoe residue on my hand. It's hot out. It's hot out here in Vegas. So

44
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:34,950
shoes melt. If you wear shoes made out of glycerin or whatever my shoes are made out of. I don't know.

45
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:47,779
The doctor does them. I don't. Oh shit actually says that. It doesn't. No, it doesn't. No, it

46
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:54,840

47
00:08:55,559 --> 00:09:04,460
No, it doesn't. That's, that's, that's water. I can't eat any more of this. This is

78
00:19:44,579 --> 00:19:57,029
it's in the same spot as this yeah yeah i know i got it but i i can assume this is like somebody

79
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:02,390
with an incredibly realistic totally a total reaction that makes perfect sense

80
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:11,059
well for the stupid fucking thing that i do on the stream sometimes let me see this is probably

81
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:21,029
going to be an actual reaction that like a normal person would probably have let's see so it looks

82
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:34,069
like deal or no deal isn't really working what the fuck is this who's this

83
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,740
all right i'm gonna switch it to whatever fucking game that is

84
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:05,240
why does he sound like that this month so it looks like dealer no

85
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:26,329
deal why do i sound like he's bright he's bright he's got plenty of points look all right

86
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:37,849
okay i just ate a shoe on camera if somebody finds this stream and they don't know what the

87
00:21:37,849 --> 00:21:43,130
fucking the the oh that's a perfectly normal reaction to have you're probably going to show

88
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:49,769
me a clip tomorrow of somebody that found this stream today and there he is eating a fucking shoe

89
00:21:49,769 --> 00:21:54,200
and like screaming okay well let's go to the next stream because i don't want to i'm not going to

90

91
00:22:04,819 --> 00:22:19,589
the wii today share the shoe clip that all that does is benefit me you understand that just brings

92
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:30,759
me benefit maybe not maybe not socially maybe not socially and twitch tv sense and and and view sense

93
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:37,799

138
00:27:52,299 --> 00:27:58,539

139
00:27:58,539 --> 00:28:08,180
nondescript civilian thank you guys both of you thanks for the fucking 20 subs back to back well

140
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:13,539
i am back and we should be back to kind of normal here but what is what's normal what's this is the

141
00:28:13,539 --> 00:28:18,819
new stream schedule is what's going to happen i've noticed over the last six months or so

142
00:28:18,819 --> 00:28:22,180
because if you don't know let me let's go over let's let's just go over very quickly tldr

143
00:28:22,819 --> 00:28:29,380
i have a issue with my rib cage in my spine i have some problem we don't know if it's

144
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:33,700
costochondritis if i have arthritis we don't exactly know what exactly what's causing it

145
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:40,140
but we do have an idea right i've noticed over the last couple weeks of not really streaming that

146
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:46,299
much right so i've been moving around kim and i have been packing boxes we've been moving and

147
00:28:47,579 --> 00:28:52,779
i feel a little looser and we did some streams that were shorter that were like three or four

148
00:28:52,779 --> 00:29:00,660
hours last week and the week before that and i'm a little looser and i think what i'm what i'm

149
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:06,579
coming to the conclusion of this is what i've had discussions with this very thing is how do you how

150
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:33,829
do you say this word sedentary sedentary sedentary sedentary sedentary sedentary right so

151
00:29:35,299 --> 00:29:43,450
when i sit here sedentary for more than four five six plus hours it hurts a lot and i've noticed

152
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:49,289
that the shorter streams i'm it doesn't hurt as much and i'm i can it's it it's easier when

153
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:54,490
i move around i can stay moving i can stay mobile so here's what i've decided to do

154
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:03,029
right all right i'm streaming i forgot um here's what i've decided to do what's going to happen

155
00:30:03,029 --> 00:30:13,640
here is instead of six to eight hour streams three or four days a week i'm going to pull it back to

156
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:22,460
like four to six hour streams four to five days a week so there's going to be short and then i've

157
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:27,339
said this before like hey i'm going to do shorter streams but more we're going to pull back times

158
00:30:27,339 --> 00:30:34,069
and stream more often because doing like four to six hours in and then being able to get up and

159
00:30:34,069 --> 00:30:40,890
move around and i it's i don't just sit still for a very long time it helps a lot and i've been

160
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:45,289
noticing a very very huge difference only because i haven't been streaming and i've and the streams

161
00:30:45,289 --> 00:30:49,220
i've been doing have been short so i'm going to keep that up i'm going to see if it helps i'm

162
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:57,019
going to see if it works so yeah you can expect instead of like three seven to eight hour plus

163
00:30:57,019 --> 00:31:03,420
streams you'll get like four or five like four to six hour streams starting now starting until i

164
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:09,109
decide i want to change it or do something else it was also the idea that it was also the idea

165
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:20,440
that i would stream potentially twice a day so instead of a four to six hour stream five days

166
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:26,890
a week maybe i do like two to three hours take like a 30 40 plus minute break and come back in

167
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:32,819
an hour get some food and come back and do like another two or three hours i just have to move

168
00:31:32,819 --> 00:31:38,470
around i have to there's also the idea maybe get a standing desk but the reason why i don't want to

169
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:45,000
do two streams in a day is because i i like i burn up quickly i know that a lot of guys understand

170
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,799
you guys get that and a lot a lot of guys know that by now and so some of these streams were

171
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:56,730
very high energy and after like three four plus hours like it's like a um what's a good analogy

172
00:31:56,730 --> 00:32:03,980
to describe like something that like lights up real quick and then it's gone so if i were to do

173
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:13,160
a funnel fireworks okay yeah um no but i don't want to say that that's like a cheesy analogy

174
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:20,170
i'm a firework oh no you're not oh you you eat potato chips on the fucking couch all day like

175
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:28,099
relax but if i stream like three or four hours and then i go take like a two hour break i might

176
00:32:28,099 --> 00:32:38,490
just like lose all my energy and that'll be it your sneeze yeah it comes out real quick

177
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:48,059
and really strong and it's uh no but it's like and it feels like kind of good for a second

178
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:53,750
and then you don't after like three or four you're like i want this to be over but that doesn't make

179
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:58,099
any sense because everyone around you doesn't want to be around you you guys want to be around

180
00:32:58,579 --> 00:33:04,650
you know what i'm saying i don't think that works who's the sneeze in the scenario don't drop

181
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:15,509
anything you're no okay anyways i'm going to change the schedule we're not changing oh i'm

185
00:33:30,619 --> 00:33:40,650

someone's not looking at you directly in the eyes when somebody's not doing eye contact but

195
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:54,469
they're like pretending to right where instead of like this like this i do that all the time

00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:17,530

332
00:57:31,079 --> 00:57:34,679
at the same time so it's like seven to it's like 20 million countries all fighting together at the

507
01:36:18,119 --> 01:36:25,000
that's this i have never been a quitter to leave office before my term is completed is

508
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:34,500
abhorrent to every instinct in my body but as president i must put the interests of america

509
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:45,270
first america needs a full-time president and a full-time congress particularly at this time

510
01:36:45,270 --> 01:36:52,920
with problems we face at home and abroad to continue to fight through the months ahead for

511
01:36:52,920 --> 01:37:00,279
my personal vindication would almost totally absorb the time and attention of both the president

512
01:37:01,079 --> 01:37:08,520
and the congress in a period when our entire focus should be on the great issues of peace

513
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:17,979
abroad and prosperity without inflation at home therefore the point the presidency effective

514
01:37:17,979 --> 01:37:27,239
that noon tomorrow vice president ford will be sworn in as president at that hour in this office

515

i'm still gonna play it though i mean am i not gonna play it remember i can jump now when do

596
02:00:28,920 --> 02:00:56,840
we find a human what the hell is this like a briar patch oh a regular lizard bees oh my god

597
02:00:59,210 --> 02:01:08,069
what are those mites holy shit they just disintegrated that lizard try to avoid the

598
02:01:08,069 --> 02:01:40,649
mites what am i doing get off me i could just like feel those on me can i jump over them

599
02:01:41,130 --> 02:02:06,460
this is kind of a scary game kinda wait watch it they have they have a they have a pattern

600
02:02:06,460 --> 02:02:16,039
we'll just avoid them jump over them i think i have to just i have to go through them underneath

601
02:02:16,039 --> 02:02:25,770
them can i make it if i run now i think you just have to just get through them they'll just suck

602
02:02:25,770 --> 02:02:53,529
your blood okay they're like a they're like a laser you just have to avoid herma has mites it's the

603
02:02:53,529 --> 02:02:56,409
very opposite of a laser no i'm talking about like in a game where it's just like

604
02:02:57,050 --> 02:03:00,810
rare rare to go through you have to run through before you get hit by the laser

605
02:03:02,090 --> 02:03:23,750
figure maybe you can knock them down they're running away oh the mites the mites are going

606
02:03:23,750 --> 02:03:36,149
after me fuck i get too many there's too many around me i gotta run away

607
02:03:44,039 --> 02:04:01,350
uh one more why is my stream 720p um there's a few reasons for that uh

608
02:04:01,350 --> 02:04:06,229
1080p actually uh in my opinion this is my opinion is i don't think it's worth streaming

609
02:04:07,270 --> 02:04:13,430
because it takes a lot more bandwidth it takes a lot more resources and 1080p doesn't really even

610
02:04:13,430 --> 02:04:20,949
look any good until about eight to ten thousand k up so twitch really only allows six thousand up

611
02:04:21,510 --> 02:04:27,430
to pretty much anybody to stream to the platform so a 1080p stream at six thousand up i mean you're

612
02:04:27,750 --> 02:04:33,590
talking about a 1080 footage really needs like 10 000 up like look good at least eight to ten

613
02:04:34,310 --> 02:04:46,500
that's why i don't do it now you can do like eight some people do 900p like 870 880 i could

614
02:04:46,500 --> 02:04:53,449
do that but i got a 1080 maybe in the future we'll see we'll see where's this other spider

615
02:04:53,449 --> 02:05:03,029
that's apparently alive just talking yeah i'm talking bitrate like 4 000 up like bitrate like

616
02:05:03,029 --> 02:05:15,350
a 6 000 bitrate where does this want me to go what just happened did i just like skip a major

617
02:05:15,350 --> 02:05:22,119
part of the level oh it's these things it's the other spider i don't like the other like weird

618
02:05:22,119 --> 02:05:29,350
spiders like the black widows yep i hate these look i know it's cool i know like yeah you got

619
02:05:29,350 --> 02:05:59,720
a tattoo of a black widow i know like but no i don't like them i'm gonna die find the widow's

620
02:05:59,720 --> 02:06:05,140
cathedral hold the b button to build up your venom and then swing the wiimote down to deliver

621
02:06:05,140 --> 02:06:17,579
a venom pounce it's a dot oh okay that's fucking awesome that's so cool all right let me give me

622
02:06:17,579 --> 02:06:27,189
these grubs it's the cathedral we gotta go find the cathedral they have organized religion

623
02:06:29,750 --> 02:06:43,020
all right uh there's another grub over here okay this way and then

624
02:06:44,890 --> 02:06:48,300
all right germa has a mick chicken tattoo and then that would be a pretty cool one

625
02:06:50,520 --> 02:06:56,680
but i'm talking like in the wrapper like the the solid wrapper wrapped mick chicken sandwich

626
02:06:58,779 --> 02:07:13,640
that sounds pretty good that would be cool running away i want to try the venom pounce on somebody

627
02:07:14,199 --> 02:07:27,670
remember do you eat the wrapper shit you're bringing back some weird like memories when i

628
02:07:27,670 --> 02:07:34,550
was younger what was the bubble gum that you chewed the wrapper i remember there was a gum

629
02:07:35,699 --> 02:07:44,229
that like you people chewed with the wrapper on what was it i swear to god this was a thing

630
02:07:44,789 --> 02:07:54,460
it was like i think i was lied to when i was a kid it was like oh yeah you eat it with the wrapper

631
02:07:54,460 --> 02:07:58,380
on you chew it with the wrapper on and i would chew the gum with the wrapper on this one specific

632
02:07:58,380 --> 02:08:05,180
brand for some reason there was a reason for it and i remember it was weird and it didn't it was

633
02:08:05,180 --> 02:08:09,260
just like this doesn't feel right i shouldn't be doing it like this but i did it and i have to take

634
02:08:09,340 --> 02:08:17,260
eventually you take the like mushed up wrapper out of your mouth why did i do that does anybody

635
02:08:17,260 --> 02:08:26,489
anybody else do that any of you for any reason starburst no i'm not talking about unwrapping

636
02:08:26,489 --> 02:08:30,810
i'm talking about in the wrapper it goes in your mouth and you chew it with the wrapper on and

637
02:08:30,810 --> 02:08:39,770
like break the wrapper down with your teeth chewing it it was stride it was seriously it was trident

02:10:51,159 --> 02:10:57,880
family guy has like 28 seasons of show and the whole point of family guy is they come up

646
02:10:57,880 --> 02:11:06,119
with like 600 random references a an episode they're talking about 600 times 30 episodes a

647
02:11:06,119 --> 02:11:15,560
season so and so 30 times 28 it's like there's like 25 million there's like this probably like

648
02:11:15,560 --> 02:11:25,899
55 000 family guy references over the years oh wait we got we got a fog window here

649
02:11:35,859 --> 02:11:50,250
freeze him nice all right back it up again poison nice this one was fucking pretty good

650
02:11:50,970 --> 02:12:11,319
that was an instant kill eat the shoe you're not you're a little late oh never mind when

651
02:12:11,319 --> 02:12:18,739
are we gonna get another muffled when we're gonna get another muffled like 60 000 dollar line from

652
02:12:18,819 --> 02:12:20,020
billy bop Thornton that just goes

653
02:12:26,329 --> 02:12:42,180
it's coming up soon why are there so many of these cell phone

654
02:12:48,300 --> 02:13:01,130
wait that's that might not be synced up that's not going to be synced up because the delay

655
02:13:01,130 --> 02:13:18,649
that's not going to be synced up correctly hey what was it oh oh oh oh i wanted to bring this

656
02:13:18,649 --> 02:13:25,829
up on stream so i've got every service that you call right let me get away from the fucking

657
02:13:25,829 --> 02:13:31,260
loud beep thing is there a reason why every time you call any service that's ever existed

658
02:13:31,819 --> 02:13:37,739
the first thing that happens is the please listen carefully as our menu options have changed

659
02:13:39,210 --> 02:13:45,609
it's like that for like seven to eight straight years why do they say that every time are they

660
02:13:45,609 --> 02:13:52,460
so terrified that you're not going to listen to the fucking menu that well okay the menu has

661
02:13:52,460 --> 02:13:56,060
options have changed i better listen now is that that's the tactic right that's the strategy

662
02:13:57,850 --> 02:14:04,649
because if you call like for instance if i were to call uh like a utility company or like a cable

663
02:14:04,649 --> 02:14:08,729
company or something it says that every fucking time and it's that same exact thing every fucking

664
02:14:08,729 --> 02:14:17,300
the menu doesn't change it's just that every single time it's for old people right i used to

665
02:14:17,300 --> 02:14:24,810
work telecom and we did that so you never changed your options that's a Seinfeld joke well guess

666
02:14:24,810 --> 02:14:31,210
what like cox cable has had that since Seinfeld was on the air do you understand that's my point

667
02:14:31,210 --> 02:14:51,420
it still works i could that's an epic kramer moment fuck i thought i could get a big one

668
02:14:51,979 --> 02:15:02,060
and i was gonna make a tweet i didn't though because like i'm lazy and i don't fucking use

669
02:15:02,060 --> 02:15:06,859
social media ever there's something wrong with me i was gonna make a tweet that was a phone and

670
02:15:06,859 --> 02:15:12,300
you know like the oh name a better duo tweets right it was gonna be it's gonna be a phone picture

671
02:15:12,300 --> 02:15:18,699
it says please listen carefully and then like another phone as our menu options have changed

672
02:15:18,699 --> 02:15:24,010
and it's gonna be like college shit that's pretty good like comedy tweet like name a name and name me

673
02:15:24,010 --> 02:15:34,920
it better do all right thank god you didn't do that why why what's wrong with that that's like

674
02:15:34,920 --> 02:15:39,720
funny that's like name me oh name me i better do like please listen carefully as our menu options

675
02:15:39,720 --> 02:15:48,939
have changed that would have been shared around like some circles right that was a new animal

676
02:15:48,939 --> 02:15:56,779
that's boomer here i didn't i didn't do it i was just i you guys act like i did this i should do it

677
02:15:56,779 --> 02:16:05,500
anyways my aunt would find that funny yeah i'm trying to work on some new demographics here

678
02:16:05,500 --> 02:16:17,079
you know we we can we can only ride the like scare every new viewer away and have people open the

679
02:16:17,079 --> 02:16:28,329
stream and go what's i hate this guy demographic for you know i gotta branch out to like aunts you

680
02:16:28,329 --> 02:16:34,889
just split a phrase what yeah but it's namely a better duo because everyone knows what that is

681
02:16:34,889 --> 02:16:40,329
and everyone's like gets it you get it your aunt does your aunt gets comedy your aunt is a

682
02:16:41,049 --> 02:16:54,040
understands comedians what's just flew by the fucking screen did i not get that double strike

683
02:16:54,040 --> 02:17:14,680
combos but i can do a move list what was that i don't know i'm not i'm not i'm not gonna i'm

684
02:17:14,680 --> 02:17:20,260
not gonna go like flood some stream so because you guys are like fucking like pranking somebody

685
02:17:20,260 --> 02:17:56,459
or something don't do that shit what i mean it's me what uh yeah yeah yeah you can't you can't be

686
02:17:56,459 --> 02:18:00,219
doing all right no you can't you actually can't be doing that you can't like be streaming like

687
02:18:00,219 --> 02:18:04,629
movies and shit and then like me naked uh so that stream is probably going to go away pretty

688
02:18:04,629 --> 02:18:12,170

730
02:26:01,180 --> 02:26:08,389
thinking of cinnabarst gum they marketed themselves as an extreme gum for hip kids in the 80s and early

731
02:26:08,389 --> 02:26:14,709
90s and used a fast dissolving material for their wrappers it was safe to digest but was more of a

732
02:26:14,709 --> 02:26:22,219
safety precaution for dumb kids than intended feature yep i remember this led to a popular

733
02:26:22,219 --> 02:26:26,219
urban legend that chewing it with the wrapper on enhanced the flavor crystals

734
02:26:27,899 --> 02:26:35,139
but they never intended for you to actually chew the wrapper that's you got it cinnabarst gum yep

735
02:26:35,139 --> 02:26:38,659
because they put crystals and it was wrapped up and you chewed through the wrapper and shit

736
02:26:41,270 --> 02:26:51,459
wow thank you thank seriously i was gonna drive me nuts i was gonna drive me nuts wow all right

02:50:51,959 --> 02:51:43,690
strange yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah invade the nest it just fucked you missed a wink oh maybe i

828
02:51:43,690 --> 02:51:50,649
should oh by the way what do i have that's valuable nothing they don't want me on that show what the

829
02:51:50,649 --> 02:52:01,000
hell do they want me on that show for just ban the word wink yeah probably just do it

830
02:52:01,639 --> 02:52:09,510
yeah he should probably do it like an hour or two chibi robo no gotcha force is more expensive

831
02:52:09,510 --> 02:52:14,229
than chibi robo gotcha force is a lot more expensive than chibi robo which by the way

832
02:52:14,229 --> 02:52:18,149
nobody trusts that by the way in the pre-stream chat we're trying to figure out what i would do

833
02:52:18,149 --> 02:52:24,360
today and unanimously i think like only four people voted for it out of like five or six hundred votes

834
02:52:26,090 --> 02:52:34,780
you didn't buy chibi robo oh i didn't i didn't you didn't i didn't buy chibi robo i don't own

835
02:52:34,780 --> 02:52:57,780
chibi robo you don't own that game but um what the fuck is this then what's um what's in here

836
02:52:57,780 --> 02:53:13,290
what is that interesting it looks like uh this looks like a gamecube disc and it's it says chibi

837
02:53:13,290 --> 02:53:33,190
robo on it i don't own this stuff i don't own that game all right whatever you get it you get it

838
02:53:33,190 --> 02:53:43,270
things fucking things pretty valuable i've got did it well it's a fake i faked you out i'm not

839
02:53:43,270 --> 02:53:52,420
gonna do that with chibi robo i just kind of did no i didn't i would never throw it be serious

840
02:53:52,420 --> 02:54:01,350
that's a commodity we rented it for a blockbuster that probably wouldn't even available on that

841
02:54:01,350 --> 02:54:09,719
blockbuster gotcha force is expensive gotcha force is really hard to find with a box and original

842
02:54:09,719 --> 02:54:15,899
manual that shit's like three or four hundred dollars if you just get the disc gotcha force

843
02:54:15,899 --> 02:54:23,190
that shit's like uh it's not it's not cheap and it's just the dumb disc not even the fucking

844
02:54:23,190 --> 02:54:29,510
manual i sold mine for four hundred dollars last year well you made some you made bank

845
02:54:29,510 --> 02:54:35,340
that game's worth a lot of money that might be the most besides cubivore cubivore and gotcha force

846
02:54:35,340 --> 02:54:41,340
are the two i think most expensive games you can find on the game somebody's gonna be like actually

847
02:54:41,979 --> 02:54:51,700
i know i know which one it's like cubivore is like 600 bucks cubivore is like five or

848
02:54:51,700 --> 02:55:05,079
six hundred dollars that's a lot of fucking money for a game cube game here we go wait somebody say

849
02:55:05,079 --> 02:55:09,959
six hundred dollars is not a lot of money for a game cube game what do you consider a lot of money

850
02:55:19,319 --> 02:55:39,159
got it oh he's dizzy he's dizzy dizzy dizzy break his neck again is it i wish you would stop

851
02:55:39,159 --> 02:56:11,719
pretending to own chibi robo bad angle bad angle like the bad angle got it ah i dodged trying to

852
02:56:11,719 --> 02:56:51,129
go that way you fucking idiot one more was that it who proved you own chibi robo put it in the

853
02:56:51,129 --> 02:56:56,200
wheat i'm in the middle of something right now if you can't i'm not sure you can tell but i'm in the

854
02:56:56,200 --> 02:57:10,459
middle of something go inside the eye show the receipt sure okay guys yeah what what do you know

855
02:57:10,459 --> 02:57:28,120
i'm not gonna give you that i'm up i'm on this ceiling he doesn't have it when you guys drunk

856
02:57:28,760 --> 02:57:57,299
only you your credit card security number to tell me you know there's there was this idea that i had

857
02:57:57,299 --> 02:58:02,340
you guys remember the like the christmas stream right where i was like hey i'm gonna give you guys

858
02:58:02,340 --> 02:58:07,299
like 500 bucks to just buy random shit and i'll just cover it whatever like i'll just pay for it

859
02:58:07,299 --> 02:58:13,020
right yeah there was this like theory that it was like i don't think i could have ever done it

860
02:58:13,979 --> 02:58:20,469
where you guys like have to use like i would just it would be terrible and i it wouldn't

861
02:58:20,469 --> 02:58:24,229
work out at all and the idea got thrown in the trash can immediately when it popped in my head

862
02:58:24,950 --> 02:58:31,959
but like if i bought like a fucking visa gift card and just like showed it and just like see

863
02:58:31,959 --> 02:58:42,920
what somebody bought but that's a bit that's a fucking that's not gonna work out like it's

864
02:58:42,920 --> 02:58:50,889
not gonna work out like what would happen what would actually happen you know what i mean have

865
02:58:50,889 --> 02:58:56,659
like the statement over here on one monitor and be like one two three there's a number and just

866
02:58:56,659 --> 02:59:04,040
like capture the window of the statement and refresh it every five seconds and then i think

867
02:59:04,040 --> 02:59:08,600
okay that's like that's like that that would never work because people would just buy a bunch of

868
02:59:08,600 --> 02:59:27,219
fucked up shit and it would come leading back to me so no what was that for um can i am i gonna

i'm trying to play the spider game end of the stream voice uh not quite coming up here soon

1005
03:35:10,729 --> 03:35:29,110
though not quite not quite did i like ray mysterio ray mysterio was fucking awesome

1006
03:35:29,190 --> 03:35:41,299
all right i'm gonna go over here when is hulk uh so because of the coronavirus amazon is not

1007
03:35:41,299 --> 03:35:48,389
shipping a lot of stuff or it's where it's delayed like prime two-day shipping doesn't really exist

1008
03:35:49,770 --> 03:35:55,299
so it's kind of just it kind of just coming it's going to come when it comes it's going to get

1009
03:35:55,299 --> 03:36:00,260
here when it gets it will get it when it gets here you said you would buy it a month ago i know

1010
03:36:01,139 --> 03:36:10,739
and i know he's lying no i'm not go to go to hulk ultimate destruction on the game cube right now

1011
03:36:10,739 --> 03:36:18,950
on amazon and find one and the shipping dates are within like the next couple weeks things are coming

1012
03:36:18,950 --> 03:36:25,979
faster than you think it's just giving out a date just in case well okay there we go i don't lie

1013
03:36:25,979 --> 03:36:34,360
about everything guys just the most stuff 30 webcams yeah that's also impossible too because

1014
03:36:35,000 --> 03:36:39,319
also due to the coronavirus webcams are in very short supply right now

1015
03:36:40,469 --> 03:36:50,629
and so they were either completely out of stock or they're two hundred dollars for one that's

1016
03:36:50,629 --> 03:37:02,889
also another unfortunate thing why is the game why is this game 77 dollars why is the game 77

1017
03:37:02,889 --> 03:37:10,540
wait why is what do you mean microphones too yeah but it makes sense though it makes sense because

1018
03:37:11,500 --> 03:37:18,459
tons of people are working from home and conferencing from home and people are communicating

1019
03:37:18,459 --> 03:37:23,340
over you know the social distancing so it makes sense as to why the webcams wouldn't be really

1020
03:37:24,139 --> 03:37:33,049
um something that's very very readily available right now uh but yeah we just we have to figure

1021
03:37:33,049 --> 03:37:39,500
that out whenever those come back into stock maybe we can see how things are and get them done all

1022
03:37:39,500 --> 03:37:42,379
right i gotta okay i'm like upside down let me see what the hell i'm doing

1023
03:37:43,180 --> 03:37:50,409

1167
04:08:13,659 --> 04:08:20,680
for vr streams does that mean 500 sub bicep germa is coming back no no that just means

1168
04:08:21,850 --> 04:08:30,379
i'm staying loose the looser that i stay the better that i feel that's kind of the reasoning

1169
04:08:30,379 --> 04:08:37,180
for pulling streams back but adding stream days so i can stream essentially the same amount of time

1170
04:08:37,180 --> 04:08:43,799
but spread out for less time per stream because i can stay loose easier that way that's the idea

1171
04:08:44,520 --> 04:08:53,379
see if it works uh but thank you jzzb for the thousand bits sorry you had to eat that shoe

1172
04:08:53,379 --> 04:09:00,780
it was probably really gross and sugary isn't that bad it actually was pretty good i didn't

1176
04:09:34,809 --> 04:09:43,100
stream today because i probably should have saved the eat the shoe for like the end of the stream

1177
04:09:44,090 --> 04:09:50,729
because eating the shoe in the very beginning was like oh whoa we're going to fucking a million

right now and we got i got everybody too excited you opened it up too early

gritty kind of texture to them sometimes it depends if you feel like it they're okay they're not

1295
04:28:01,049 --> 04:28:04,729
i wouldn't i wouldn't order them but if they were in a candy dish and

i was awkwardly talking to some friends or something that i haven't seen in a long time

1297
04:28:10,010 --> 04:28:14,729
i would just keep eating them to make it so i had something for my mouth to do besides talk so i

five community subs thanks wingman thank you and wingman won gave five dollars earlier as well

1343
04:34:51,860 --> 04:34:56,259
when i was in summer camp in 2010 i felt something crawling on my face in the middle of the night

1344
04:34:56,259 --> 04:35:02,259
i picked it up and tossed it over the bunk i still don't know what it was well the terrifying thing

1345
04:35:02,259 --> 04:35:07,779
about what you're saying here is it was big enough for you to grab with your hand if it was big

1346
04:35:07,779 --> 04:35:25,700
enough for you to hold in your hand and throw that's terrifying i think everyone's had a scenario

1347
04:35:25,700 --> 04:35:29,380
like that play out potentially in their life where you just don't know what it was and it

1348
04:35:29,380 --> 04:35:35,700
could be anything and then you just never know and never knowing is awful because what the hell was

1349
04:35:35,700 --> 04:35:45,029
it and what could it could it be possible that that could happen again it actually happens not

1350
04:35:45,830 --> 04:35:49,270
super frequently but not infrequently enough where you don't realize it's happening

1351
04:35:49,909 --> 04:35:53,590
how many times do you feel just something like touch your arm or like your leg or something when

1352
04:35:53,590 --> 04:35:58,950
you're lying down in bed and it's just like rip toss throw as fucking hard as i can in that

1353
04:35:58,950 --> 04:36:06,279
in left direction and you just have no idea and you'll never know it could have been a piece of

1354
04:36:06,279 --> 04:36:19,819
hair and you'll never know an anonymous cheerer thanks for five dollars 500 bits just 500 bits

1355
04:36:19,819 --> 04:36:24,700
dropping him right here thank you reaper thanks for 250 hey since the rumble is until september

1356
04:36:24,700 --> 04:36:29,819
because of covet 19 can we maybe get a sneak peek event advertising the rumble it's been too

1357
04:36:29,819 --> 04:36:46,380
long since we've seen our friends from the ring um yeah yeah the plan is this is the plan the rumble

1358
04:36:48,090 --> 04:36:56,299
and a few matches will happen in september before the marathon but probably gonna do

1359
04:36:56,380 --> 04:37:12,810
do a small card of kind of a pre matches with no rumble so instead of having the the big main event

1360
04:37:12,810 --> 04:37:19,080
being the 30 person rumble and it's like an hour we'll just do some matches with some new characters

1361
04:37:19,900 --> 04:37:24,860
and the rumble will be in september so maybe like a few weeks leading up to the the rumble

1362
04:37:24,860 --> 04:37:31,659
we'll do that or maybe we won't and maybe i'll just save everything and just have a huge event

1363
04:37:31,659 --> 04:37:37,509
because that rumble is going to be for charity that's going to be a charity stream those that

1364
04:37:37,509 --> 04:37:44,790
don't know all the money that's going to come through that stream is going to be directly

1365
04:37:45,669 --> 04:37:55,000
given to charity there's going to be a direct link it'll be tracked it'll be easy we'll have all that

1366
04:37:55,000 --> 04:38:02,759
set up so it's just completely just transparent and there it is and it open so it might be better

1367
04:38:02,759 --> 04:38:07,560
to have it all be one big you know three four five hour event rather than one small one that

1368
04:38:07,560 --> 04:38:24,580
would be much better i think we'll see but that's the plan still scheduled for september not sure

1369
04:38:24,580 --> 04:38:29,770
we want to do before it hey demonic cucumber thanks for 250 i haven't given any bits in a

1370
04:38:29,770 --> 04:38:34,169
while because i've missed a lot of streams from my new sleep schedule i didn't really know what to

i say it every time 250 during a while back you said you wanted a pet reptile of some kind

1391
04:41:16,630 --> 04:41:23,450
have your feelings changed do you have an update for us i was looking around for something that

1392
04:41:23,450 --> 04:41:29,130
would be something i really want to take care of and but the move has been a lot more complicated

1393
04:41:29,930 --> 04:41:37,049
because of all the coronavirus stuff so it hasn't really been a simple process to kind of move and

1394
04:41:37,049 --> 04:41:43,450
get everything done and situated and that's it um so that's kind of been put on the back burner

1395
04:41:43,450 --> 04:41:52,680
for a while until things sort of settle down and decide if that's something that i actually

1396
04:41:52,680 --> 04:42:03,860
really want to do i do though what was that pinball that was uh odama odama dobski dude
