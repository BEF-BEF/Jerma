00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:18,420
Hello, how's everybody doing? Welcome back to streamer of the week. That's me. I won the uh

2
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:27,260
just want to make sure I won the 2016 streamer of the week award. I like to announce that every

3
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:38,570
stream just so people are aware. I played Minecraft for like a couple hours and I built a cool snowman

4
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:50,179
looked just like Olaf and it was it was an honor. But welcome to another VR stream. Hope you're

5
00:00:50,179 --> 00:01:00,179
well rested. Just put on my uh utility belt on my hands and we'll get started. Give me one second.

6
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:49,560
So I wanted to try and see if I could get more of the room here.

7
00:01:52,760 --> 00:02:05,579
God, because when I that's a little bit more wide, right? Oh well you can like see that shit. I want

8
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:16,629
to get let me move that like this so you can see more of the room. I'll go like that. Why don't

9
00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:22,789
you turn this way? There we go. Okay, so now I've got the complaint. I got a lot of complaints,

10
00:02:22,789 --> 00:02:27,270
okay? Last stream where once I got to be about here I wasn't in frame anymore

11
00:02:28,389 --> 00:02:32,229
and then once I got to be about here I also wasn't in frame anymore and we've got full

12
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:41,900
widescreen now. Ain't you understand? People were complaining. I got emails. So there we go. See

13
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:48,699
now no matter where I am you should be able to see me across your entire television set.

14
00:02:50,120 --> 00:03:01,590
Isn't that something? I also got a haircut. What do you think? My twitch chat back here.

15
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:07,879
Too short? Well you can't you can't that's you can't even see it. That's the joke.

16
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:13,689
Glad you laughed at it. But anyways let me get started here. We're gonna play Gorn. This is the

17
00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:20,599
first game we're gonna play is Gorn and let's make sure that you can see this. Otherwise I'm

18
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:32,330
gonna be in big trouble and hey look at that. All right now this is gonna be hard to drink.

19
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:38,090
Coffee. Wait let me make sure because sometimes I get here but is that a good widescreen display?

20
00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:44,409
You know what I'm saying? Like if I'm gonna say I'm going to walk this way it's gonna happen.

21
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:53,270
That's a good display right? I'm just concerned if I like stand here.

22
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:57,819
I'll just be like where I'm supposed to be like right here. This is perfect all right.

23
00:04:01,129 --> 00:04:07,860
Tilt the camera down. Now if I tilt the camera down you'll get to see like below the belt

24
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:13,449
and then if I like this is like the only place it can be because if I stand here

25
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:17,610
then like look at this shit. Like I'm cut off over there. It's gotta be.

26
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:28,699
Like I think that's perfect. I have to go down so I can show feet. I don't think so.

27
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:33,670
Yeah what if I do it a little bit. I don't want I don't want this real estate to be that much

28
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:39,370
taken up. You know what I mean? We'll do a little bit. All right I'm stalling long enough. Let me

29
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:46,149
get my hands in here. Welcome to another edition of fucking boomer plays virtual games.

30
00:04:47,029 --> 00:04:55,350
Hot dogs horseshoes and hand grenades is what we're doing next. All right you don't think I

31
00:04:55,350 --> 00:05:09,319
got that queued up already? All right let's go. I'm going in. Oh no I'm not. Which one of these

32
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:17,589
goes in? So Goren from my understanding it's uh it's a game where you you have a farm

33
00:05:18,949 --> 00:05:25,029
and your your grandfather dies and then the farm is then given to you and you can buy like uh

34
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:30,069
cabbage. There's like parsley. You you have to like press buttons on on wood to get wood to build

35
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:37,560
stuff. It's something like that. That's what at least I think. There's a bunch of towns people

36
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,399
I guess that you can make friends with and you can like romance them. It's kind of an interesting

37
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:52,939
experience I guess. All right let me say that. Can I say you guys? Hey there you are. Move hand here.

38
00:05:55,050 --> 00:06:06,389
Press and hold to wait move hand here. Press and hold to grab world. Pull hold and pull world.

39
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:15,480
I hate this already. I look like a different game. I don't like to like rowboat mechanic already.

40
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:37,689
Is this supposed to be going faster? I have to ski. I'm doing something wrong right?

41
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:56,339
What am I doing wrong here? Uh that's not correct. What is going on?

42
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:06,149
Hold on. Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait. I got like strapped in already.

43
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:18,569
Fucking hand straps. I'm gonna make a VR room. I'm just gonna have it be just padded. There's

44
00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:27,430
rubber all over the place. That's not correct still. I'm gonna have like pillows on the ground

45
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:33,829
and then you won't need a wrist strap. I will construct a $14,000 room to not have to wear

46
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:53,319
these. All right okay. How are we doing huh? Rich. He's rich. All right well there we go.

47
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:58,939
I could die like I have to swim. All right grab the big Willy Wonka lever and pull it.

48
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:11,370
Gorn. So this is a game where you. You think you are special. Do you even know fight?

49
00:08:12,339 --> 00:08:26,019
Uh make a fist. So I'm trying to do the Julius Caesar thumbs down.

50
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:35,980
Jump. Fight. Let's see. I just punch him in the face.

51
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:47,909
Raise your hands. Victory is yours. Oh I get gold coins. All right so that's that's how you do. How

52
00:08:47,909 --> 00:08:56,070
do you move though? Do I have to like pull the world to move still? Dreamer kills someone. I

53
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:00,549
didn't kill anybody. Here we go. Movement options. That's what I'm talking about. Get over there.

54
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:10,919
Like an old man with a cane. What's that say? Movement options. I'm not sure. Does this one

55
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:16,860
come with guacamole? What about this one? I don't want any. I don't want any extra beans in that.

56
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:22,139
Like I'm an old fucking man like a moze. All right graphics options.

57
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:39,960
Huh? Do I have to like take the secret cube? Oh for the love of god.

58
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:48,620
Blur. Nope. Persistent blood armor shatter smooth camera on monitor. What the fuck does that mean?

59
00:09:53,850 --> 00:10:04,710
Uh strict chaperone. Out of here. Strict chaperone. My ass. Movement grab and pull.

60
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:12,490
Rotation on comfort mode. What does that mean? Gameplay options.

61
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:32,230
Enter the demo. Difficulty normal. Slow mo on kill. I just keep it default. That's fine. Tier one.

62
00:10:33,029 --> 00:10:42,679
Berserker. General. Okay you do one of them main. That's just the off game. Toggle hold.

63
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:55,860
Movement hold and gesture is this one. Endless. Is that me? All right let's go to tier one. So hold

64
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:15,850
is hold. Let's go to that. Let's tier one. Berserker. Let's go. I'm doing something wrong.

65
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:23,190
Please please. Whoa whoa whoa. Smooth. Smooth. The love of god. Smooth camera. For the love of god.

66
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:52,169
Oh now I get it. Is this why it looks like this? This kinda hurts my eyes. Movement graphics options.

67
00:11:55,429 --> 00:12:14,710
Smooth camera on monitor. Is it better? Is that better? Movement options.

68
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:32,120
Is this like frame rate or am I insane? Turn off whole world. Movement. Grip button.

69
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:43,320
HMD oriented. Controller oriented. Pull. Grip button. It might be the frame rate. I don't

70
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:54,259
know why it's like this. It is pretty laggy. Controller oriented. Yeah it is like a little

71
00:12:54,259 --> 00:13:10,139
frame rating. So controller oriented. What does that mean? Check the fps. Maybe it's something

72
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:24,600
to do with like this. Hold on. What if I do this? Is that better? Not really. Don't ask me why.

73
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:39,159
Try lowering the graphics. I don't think I can. Last time with like graphic and frame rate problems.

74
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:44,740
Maybe it's just the game maybe in the menu here. Make a middle finger with the controller.

75
00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:52,440
Oh okay I can move like this. I get it. With my thumb. Alright that's cool. Let's just get in

76
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,399
the game and see what happens. I want to see if the graphics are just like fucked up or something.

77
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:58,360
Because it's like this looks really kind of terrible.

78
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:20,360
You think you have what it takes to survive? Let's see. Win your first challenge then you

79
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:27,480
will become a fighter. Alright grab club. Hold your weapon and salute. Yeah this is not this is

80
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:38,649
not right. Like at all. Look at that. This is not supposed to look like this. Why does this look

81
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:53,450
like this? This is awful. Try a different game. Yeah this is like that just doesn't look right.

82
00:14:53,450 --> 00:15:14,299
I gotta get out of here. Turn off the motion smoothing. Allocate more rim. Um this is

83
00:15:14,299 --> 00:15:21,610
unfortunate. This is the game. This game is supposed to be really fucking good. So why like

84
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:25,370
everything over there looks normal. Like up there? No it doesn't. The whole game looks fucked up.

85
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:31,129
Looking like it's like wiggling around and shit. Nope. Goodbye. No get me out of this.

86
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:36,330
Let's go look at the ground. Like the whole game is is like jellyfish wiggling around.

87
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:46,980
That's not correct. Give me a sec. That doesn't make any sense. You think you have what it takes

88
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:55,179
to survive? Win your first challenge then you will become a fighter. Let me let home. Shield your

89
00:15:55,179 --> 00:16:08,090
eyes. Hold your weapon and salute. This doesn't make any fucking sense. That's how the game is?

90
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:20,700
Just restart steam VR. Yeah just restart it. That's weird. Did you turn up super sampling? I

91
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:31,700
didn't do anything. Dev said on steam discussion page the latest update brought frame rate issues.

92
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:47,580
Really? Well that's kind of unfortunate. Screen smoothing is off. I turned it off.

93
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:56,120
I turned off screen smoothing. Uh well for the purposes of just getting this going

94
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:06,460
use an older version. How the hell am I gonna do that? How do I use an older version of the game?

95
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:18,359
You can't like go where we're gonna how do I get an older version of Gorn? Right click properties

96
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:33,859
versions. I'm gonna have betas. Manual enable steam overlay is just unchecked. Nah nah this is

97
00:17:33,859 --> 00:17:42,089
fucked up. Hello everyone. We've received a number of reports about performance issues affecting some

98
00:17:42,089 --> 00:17:46,809
people since the update. While we've been able to we have been unable to reproduce these issues of

99
00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:51,930
our own we've investigated as much as we can and did we can and did another update now to address

100
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:56,009
these problems. If you're having performance issues since this update can you please try the

101
00:17:56,009 --> 00:18:04,039
current version and let us know if the issue has been resolved. This is literally from two days ago.

102
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:16,299
Uh I don't think it fixed it. Oh it's literally. Well um we're gonna have to go back to this I

103
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:28,490
think. Unless like let's go betas none. Nah there are no betas here. I think they updated the game

104
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:34,809
today. Well that's unfortunate. Let's go play hot dogs, horses, and hand grenades. I'll come back

105
00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:49,420
to Gorn. Give me a sec while I open it up. Oh fuck did I lose my uh did I seriously lose my

106
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:58,859
OVR drop? What the hell? Oh god damn it. That's a pain in the ass. I was ready to go too. Come on.

107
00:18:58,859 --> 00:19:19,769
What a bunch of bullshit. Hold on. You gotta be kidding me. I have to like set this back up again.

108
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:29,319
This is what we call a pain in the ass guys. I'm gonna put this up for a minute.

109
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:47,460
Fucking Gorn. How come I can't do this now? Now the controls aren't turned on. That would help.

110
00:19:54,119 --> 00:20:05,579
Hold on. Sorry this is happening. Yep. Oh my god why are you doing this? Why I was ready to play

111
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,480
this motherfucker. And now like I have oh my god I'm so pissed off right now.

112
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:37,369
I was ready to play. It's done. We were good to go. How am I gonna get this now? Oh that's way too

113
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:56,309
big. And play 03. I had to save too. Why? Why is this so huge? This is like gigantic. All right

114
00:20:56,309 --> 00:21:20,089
there we go. Okay let's open up hot dogs, heroes, and hand grenades. I don't know what the game is.

115
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:39,000
Here it comes. There should be an update like two days ago that breaks this game too.

116
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:47,900
Here see we did like an update and like now like some people just can't play it.

117
00:21:47,900 --> 00:22:04,119
Who fucking knows what the problem is? Hot dogs. Hot dogs, horseshoes, and hand grenades.

118
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:17,369
That's unfortunate. It looked like a really fun game. I would have loved to have played it.

119
00:22:18,009 --> 00:22:42,839
We'll try it again another time. Hey hey remember me? Mountain Blade VR. See this yeah this is

563
02:15:52,890 --> 02:15:59,399
four more times i'm not off that by the way all right let's see item spawner difficulty standard

02:16:18,869 --> 02:16:23,270
uh take an old setup you're starting where does it say loot where does it say loot

568
02:16:25,939 --> 02:16:30,659
difficulty item doesn't say loot there it is loot progression okay so you guys know what to do

569
02:16:32,649 --> 02:16:37,290
so i'm gonna i'm gonna introduce the scene i say oh playing take and hold this is a

570

941
04:53:00,330 --> 04:53:10,090
sarento no not yet i wonder if i feel ill watching this because of vr because i barely started an

942
04:53:10,090 --> 04:53:23,139
essay no i think it's because of the this game this game is incredibly intense all right well

943
04:53:23,139 --> 04:53:29,270
sorry that we're dropping frames but i can really only realistically play this game for like another

944
04:53:30,729 --> 04:53:50,380
maybe like another 20 to 30 minutes let's go back in a new game we'll see how i feel i've been in it

945
04:53:50,380 --> 04:53:55,610
for about five hours we'll see how i feel after this i want to try to get my hair is all fucked

946
04:53:55,610 --> 04:54:14,119

947
04:54:14,119 --> 04:54:23,240
yeah that's i'm gonna play them but i'm gonna play all of them eventually but you do kind of

948
04:54:23,240 --> 04:54:31,779
have to give yourself a break because it's essentially over the last three oh look okay

949
04:54:31,779 --> 04:54:41,880
okay thanks for coming to the stream uh realistically i mean i've got like like 15

950
04:54:41,880 --> 04:54:49,509
16 17 hours in vr in three days this is more physical activity i think i've had in the last

951
04:54:49,509 --> 04:55:01,540
year go back in the hole all right let's go i missed a tunnel where's the secret tunnel

952
04:55:11,259 --> 04:55:14,150
i don't think that's it i don't think it a good view

953
04:55:18,279 --> 04:55:56,299
oh my god that hurts spiral ramp thank you i'm like holding this button down oh man i'm getting i

960
04:59:42,869 --> 04:59:46,919
i just kept putting a jar and shook it

961
05:00:21,349 --> 05:00:45,299
that way i wonder how many people have left the stream because this game is like making them feel

962
05:00:46,020 --> 05:00:53,979
i'm sorry i'm sorry this is still fun though all right another alien i'll get it

967
05:03:09,860 --> 05:03:29,349
lighthouse and then that's it what over there this game is surprisingly player friendly not viewer

968
05:03:29,349 --> 05:03:40,889
friendly yeah it probably isn't you probably guys probably fucking sick right now uh it's really fun

969
05:03:41,689 --> 05:04:02,860
you lost a thousand viewers well i people i don't i don't blame you you know i don't blame you if

970
05:04:02,860 --> 05:04:06,939
you can't watch something like this you can't watch it you know if a thousand people leave

971
05:04:06,939 --> 05:04:10,299
it just gets like i can't physically watch you play this that's that's all right

972
05:04:15,580 --> 05:04:23,159
let me get a better view all right let me just ski over there and see let me just see what that is

973
05:04:23,880 --> 05:04:27,000
and once i see what that is we're probably gonna stop

974
05:04:28,520 --> 05:05:15,159
because i know what that is face look at how beautiful that is over there though

975
05:05:16,119 --> 05:05:34,250

1088
05:45:02,180 --> 05:45:07,689
just fucking around i know but you gotta remember if people aren't prepared for the noise that loud

1089
05:45:08,569 --> 05:45:15,479
you know you could fucking actually mess up somebody's head you could blow out an ear you

1090
05:45:15,479 --> 05:45:21,000
could fuck up a speaker you just gotta remember you're dealing with people just like you you know

1091
05:45:21,000 --> 05:45:26,040
would you want your speaker blown out i don't think you would what have you had it up loud

1092
05:45:26,840 --> 05:45:33,130
no you couldn't yeah you could you could like it would be the subwoofer will just blow out

1093
05:45:33,770 --> 05:45:37,689
and the tube in the middle will just fly out at like 100 miles per hour it's dangerous shit

1094
05:45:41,580 --> 05:45:50,060
but thank you binary uh commando i think commando uh commando nom thanks for the two bucks

1095
05:45:51,029 --> 05:45:54,389
i found someone on deviantart who makes stuffed animals and i'm gonna pay him

1096
05:45:54,389 --> 05:46:10,520
in march to make a stuffed animal of you well uh that's i hope you have uh i don't even know how

1097
05:46:10,520 --> 05:46:17,159
to say anything without out of context just being bad i um that is a thing that you're going to buy

1098
05:46:18,119 --> 05:46:25,939
that you're gonna get made i just hope you don't stick needles in it while chanting and trying to

1099
05:46:25,939 --> 05:46:36,860
hurt me if anything like if you're gonna do that if you're gonna do like uh like a curse or something

1100
05:46:37,740 --> 05:46:44,860
just like put me in like a nice warm bath right dude nobody does nice shit with one of those

1101
05:46:44,860 --> 05:46:52,389
dolls you know open up like cook bacon and then hold me up and just kind of swirl me around over

1102
05:46:52,389 --> 05:47:08,139
where the bacon is cooking so i can smell it give me a nice warm bath do nice things what do you

1103
05:47:08,139 --> 05:47:14,150
mean that's worse you don't think if you just woke up in the morning randomly one day and you could

1104
05:47:14,150 --> 05:47:19,990
just smell bacon you'd be like wow it smells like bacon in here this is delicious and i guess that

1105
05:47:19,990 --> 05:47:23,590
would be kind of worse because then you would go to wherever your kitchen was thinking somebody made

1106
05:47:23,590 --> 05:47:30,490
bacon and they didn't on second thought just stab me with the knives that's probably better pluck

1107
05:47:30,569 --> 05:47:39,990
out his chest hairs play loud videos to the doll it just put my ear up to his speaker

1108
05:47:41,299 --> 05:47:49,020
you guys are fucking vicious why would you want to do that to me what chest hairs i got plenty

1109
05:47:53,450 --> 05:47:59,930
but thank you commando thank you uh cougar for the one dollar germa germa germa gimme gimme gimme

1110
05:48:00,650 --> 05:48:13,590
a hernia a alec thanks to the one dollar is an htc vibe a good investment a yes it is

1111
05:48:16,250 --> 05:48:19,770
i would put the 100 stamp of recommendation and approval on

1112
05:48:19,770 --> 05:48:30,939
the vibe just the last three sessions alone was worth the five six hundred dollar investment

1113
05:48:30,939 --> 05:48:36,200
to play it because it's a lot different i mean i know i know some of you guys have probably played

1114
05:48:36,200 --> 05:48:40,279
it at conventions or at a friend's house or something but when you have it in your own room

1115
05:48:41,080 --> 05:48:45,959
and you can just go in and play it it's a lot different than just doing like uh i guess i'm

1116
05:48:45,959 --> 05:48:54,540
like gonna do this for like 10 minutes what's this demo it's a lot more fun now what i would

1117
05:48:54,540 --> 05:49:01,419
tell you somebody just already mentioned it valve and htc they are coming out with a new one it's

1118
05:49:01,419 --> 05:49:12,779
called the cosmo right the htc vibe cosmo it's not out yet but it might be a different maybe

1119
05:49:12,779 --> 05:49:18,169
potentially better version of the one that currently exists i don't know they're not

1120
05:49:18,729 --> 05:49:30,180
discontinuing the regular one from what i know yeah the htc cosmo it's that is not valve that's

1121
05:49:30,180 --> 05:49:49,400
htc only well uh they announced it very recently so we'll see cosmos is different valve has their

1122
05:49:49,400 --> 05:49:58,220
own in development really so there's going to be a cosmos and a new valve only made one

1123
05:50:01,110 --> 05:50:04,229
uh you you kind of making too many you know you got that's gonna be four

1124
05:50:05,029 --> 05:50:19,860
that's a little weird because there's five five pro cosmos and then whatever valve is doing because

1125
05:50:19,860 --> 05:50:29,880
i know they're not getting rid of the old ones they're not gonna finish it maybe not but we'll

1126
05:50:29,880 --> 05:50:44,259
see what they do but anyways we had uh yeah i would say yes it is currently for the standard

1127
05:50:44,340 --> 05:50:51,380
default five it's 499 but if you like me you're kind of going to need an accessory or two

1128
05:50:52,659 --> 05:50:58,099
i had to get two stands to hold the lighthouses because i couldn't put them they weren't that i

1129
05:50:58,099 --> 05:51:06,069
couldn't clamp them anywhere so that was another like 60 bucks plus if you want a couple extra

1130
05:51:06,069 --> 05:51:09,270
lighthouses you know who knows it depending on how big your room is or what you want to do with it

1131
05:51:10,229 --> 05:51:21,029
it could cost between five and seven hundred bucks or wireless if you want to get the wireless

1132
05:51:21,029 --> 05:51:31,639
thing that's 299 which i like think i have to get it it almost makes it necessary when you're trying

1133
05:51:31,639 --> 05:51:40,279
to do a room scale thing sitting down sure i don't think it's necessary or standing only but doing

1134
05:51:40,279 --> 05:51:45,849
like the two or three steps forward and backwards and turning around 360 i think i have to get it

1135
05:51:46,729 --> 05:51:55,909
you can get some elgato lights for cheaper than that uh but these i mean these ones came with

1136
05:51:55,909 --> 05:52:09,750
a bundle so maybe you can i don't know but thank you too uh where were we here alec uh d jack thanks

1141
05:52:35,720 --> 05:52:45,259

1150
05:54:21,110 --> 05:54:29,060
no it works it's not a picture it's a website it could be dynamic and change to a screamer

1151
05:54:29,060 --> 05:54:36,119
at any time i linked flinstone's porn no that that that did not happen

1152
05:54:36,919 --> 05:54:50,520
i think we broke the site the site we may have accidentally just took it down

1153
05:54:57,450 --> 05:55:00,729
yeah that was so fucked up like barney was getting cooked or something it was

1154
05:55:00,729 --> 05:55:08,459
really fucking weird it was horrifying they were like eating each other it was very very very

1155
05:55:08,459 --> 05:55:19,750
graphic and horrible i didn't even do that i went to i searched for something don't have a search

1156
05:55:19,750 --> 05:55:36,040

1159
05:55:56,009 --> 05:56:02,409
what do you mean the amount of new subs who missed the flinstone's porn has got to be quite high

1160
05:56:02,409 --> 05:56:13,110
yeah probably a lot of new people probably have no idea

1161
05:56:14,790 --> 05:56:17,349
it's been with some weird shit on this stream that's for sure

1162
05:56:19,110 --> 05:56:23,770
hey smiter thanks for the one dollar demonic cucumber thanks for the two dollars and 50 cents

1163
05:56:24,569 --> 05:56:30,020
hey germy i got a question about the new 250 limit if i donate three 100 bit donations in a row

1164
05:56:30,020 --> 05:56:37,740
would i still be right at the end no uh it has to be 250 it's got to be of the whatever the

1165
05:56:37,740 --> 05:56:44,459
message is it has to be in a 250 limit and i'm reading one dollar one still as you see but

1166
05:56:45,020 --> 05:56:52,950
i want it to slowly over the last like last few streams get uh you know transition slowly

1167
05:56:56,419 --> 05:57:01,930
but uh it's hard for me to buy exactly 250 here anyway i thought you'd like to know there's a

1168
05:57:01,930 --> 05:57:06,889
groundhog day vr game coming out later this year other than that i'd recommend payday vr

1169
05:57:07,450 --> 05:57:13,209
essentially built again for vr and maybe la noir vr as you didn't finish the first time

1170
05:57:14,599 --> 05:57:23,849
yeah the vr case files looks fun i'll probably end up doing that at some point soon

1171
05:57:26,500 --> 05:57:34,970
but yes the message whatever you want to write if you whatever the message is that has to be

1172
05:57:34,970 --> 05:57:45,369
at two dollars and 50 cents vr needs to grow yes it does they got to solve some of the random

1173
05:57:45,369 --> 05:57:56,790
issues that pop up from time to time it's getting there though i give it like maybe another three to

1192
06:02:04,459 --> 06:02:09,900
yesterday i couldn't tell it to her but i can tell it to you shido was acting very inappropriately

1193
06:02:09,900 --> 06:02:16,540
he was yelling at people throwing cereal on the floor opening up toys and breaking them stealing

1194
06:02:16,540 --> 06:02:20,139
and eating candy bars you should have a talk with shido and with kim about his behavior

1195
06:02:21,180 --> 06:02:37,590
i'll talk to him i'll find out what happened he's acting out for some reason i don't know why

1196
06:02:37,590 --> 06:02:49,110
i think he's in some kind of phase shida would never do that i have to i gotta confirm that

1197
06:02:49,110 --> 06:02:54,919
story with kim it's important but thank you sir rock for the two dollars fifty cents

1198
06:02:55,720 --> 06:03:00,520
thank you jess you got it for the 250 i would love to see a stream in the middle of nowhere

1199
06:03:00,520 --> 06:03:07,799
in vegas just you and a table of guns teaching gun safety well that's definitely never gonna

1200
06:03:07,799 --> 06:03:14,040
happen because i do not necessarily know anything about how to handle a firearm so i would never

1201
06:03:14,759 --> 06:03:19,959
ever operate one without the proper guidance and safety procedures and i would never teach anybody

1202
06:03:20,680 --> 06:03:24,759
anything about gun safety because i know i there's no way i'd be able to tell you anything

1203
06:03:24,759 --> 06:03:28,680
i would have to step out of the way and have a professional go over safety

1204
06:03:29,639 --> 06:03:40,139
that's the point why would i ever do that you'd like to know what that's such a terrible awful

1205
06:03:40,139 --> 06:03:53,459
idea you definitely seem like an expert after today's stream your dog there's a little dog down

1206
06:03:53,459 --> 06:04:02,979
there but yeah this there's some shit that i'm doing soon as if i can get figured out this is

1207
06:04:02,979 --> 06:04:11,369

1210
06:04:29,459 --> 06:04:36,169

1263
06:12:23,590 --> 06:12:28,389
aka the desert take kim and italics to a shooting range and just try it out it's kind of relaxing

1264
06:12:28,389 --> 06:12:36,299
you shoot the shit literally i have i have been to a range before i have shot a firearm before

1265
06:12:36,299 --> 06:12:49,450
at a range a couple of years ago i've shot a nine millimeter a

1266
06:12:51,540 --> 06:12:58,500
some type of sub machine gun some type of rifle and i was too afraid to shoot the shotgun i was

1267
06:12:58,500 --> 06:13:10,869
afraid so i didn't do it it was very scary i didn't want to do it it was a very powerful

1268
06:13:10,869 --> 06:13:21,700
shotgun and i'm like i don't know if i want to do that some some guy in there shot this huge

1269
06:13:22,580 --> 06:13:29,740
huge sniper rifle and actually what they what they tell you that everybody has to stop so

1270
06:13:29,740 --> 06:13:35,020
everybody just kind of hangs back and just waits because this giant huge high caliber sniper rifle

1271
06:13:35,979 --> 06:13:42,619
we you have ear protection on first of all right and this thing you only get to shoot it one time

1272
06:13:42,619 --> 06:13:52,299
at this place and holy crap when that thing is fired you can feel it wind hits you in the face

1273
06:13:52,939 --> 06:13:57,580
and like your chest you feel like a boom deep inside of your chest it's wild

1274
06:14:02,709 --> 06:14:09,099
it was it was it definitely was an experience there was a room with probably maybe 20 30 people

1275
06:14:09,099 --> 06:14:13,990
all at this range and we all were just kind of sitting there like wait for it wait for it here

1276
06:14:13,990 --> 06:14:20,659
it goes boom and you the whole place just shakes the 50 caliber pressure wave yeah

1277
06:14:26,180 --> 06:14:34,709
no it was it was interesting would i do it again i don't maybe yeah i don't i don't see like

1278
06:14:35,430 --> 06:14:41,180
as long as it was a safe place and he was you know they did things by the book and they had a lot of

1279
06:14:41,180 --> 06:14:55,290
the procedures were good right they usually are my dad paid ten dollars for me to shoot one bullet

1280
06:14:55,290 --> 06:15:05,750
out of a barrett 50 caliber maybe that's what it was there's a shotgun called a 410 that is fun

1281
06:15:06,549 --> 06:15:15,029
i don't know i definitely wanted to like experience it at least once that was the idea

1282
06:15:18,220 --> 06:15:30,790
use a varmint rifle no it was cool it was cool but also a little nerve-wracking too because

1283
06:15:30,790 --> 06:15:36,869
you're just like somebody that i don't really handle guns or weapons ever so when they you

1284
06:15:36,869 --> 06:15:41,349
know it's like okay stand here and you're like yeah okay hey hold that it's like heavy and you're

1285
06:15:41,349 --> 06:15:46,630
like okay so and over here oh oh just hold it up okay but you're gonna be explaining everything

1286
06:15:46,630 --> 06:15:50,069
and you know you're listening and you're paying attention and you're sitting there going like

1287
06:15:50,069 --> 06:16:01,900
i'm gonna fire this i'm gonna fire this at the target and what's gonna happen it sounds

1288
06:16:01,900 --> 06:16:08,299
stressful the first like three or four shots at a range is pretty stressful but once you

1289
06:16:08,459 --> 06:16:12,619
because look it's an if you've never done it before you don't even know what to expect

1290
06:16:13,419 --> 06:16:21,799
it ain't like a fucking movie you know what i mean you gotta like control you gotta like be very very

1291
06:16:21,799 --> 06:16:24,520
attentive you have to pay the fuck attention because everything you're doing

1292
06:16:25,400 --> 06:16:45,939
shaky hands very interesting stuff though yeah attentive just hearing you talk about it is

1293
06:16:45,939 --> 06:16:50,979
stressing me out well i have i haven't really done it since no i have like that was i did it once

1294
06:16:51,619 --> 06:17:05,450
that was about two and a half years ago it was very different but there you go thank you flank

1295
06:17:05,450 --> 06:17:13,340
tank door cube thanks for the two dollars and 50 cents door cube not sure if you noticed but

1296
06:17:13,340 --> 06:17:23,560

weird saw feather thanks for the doll 78 saw feather thank you future gamer thanks for the

1299
06:17:39,240 --> 06:17:46,090
250 the dev added a super secret mode called extreme spin mode where your body angles to

1300
06:17:46,090 --> 06:17:52,459
the ground so you stand on and spin you in the direction of the jets i'm pretty good in vr and

1301
06:17:52,459 --> 06:17:58,259
almost made me projectile vomit yeah i feel bad that that's kind of what we ended on

1302
06:17:59,720 --> 06:18:04,759
because somebody did say that more than a thousand people left the stream after 10-15

1303
06:18:04,759 --> 06:18:10,520
minutes of being in that game so actually it's probably better to end on that because

1304
06:18:10,520 --> 06:18:18,810
we've been going for about four and a half hours anyways so probably better to end it

1305
06:18:18,810 --> 06:18:25,990
than start on it that game is really cool though i'm gonna have i have to go back and play that

1306
06:18:25,990 --> 06:18:33,560
one again because sometimes it was a little too much but as long as you can kind of power

1307
06:18:33,560 --> 06:18:44,819
through it it was really really really fun but thank you future gamer with the 250 thank you

1308
06:18:44,819 --> 06:18:49,939

out my hair um mr oh me double j thanks for the five dollars me double j drummer would you say

1354
06:25:46,180 --> 06:25:51,619
that vr was worth it also so far what's your favorite vr game super hot vr is not only my

1355
06:25:51,619 --> 06:25:55,700
favorite vr game it's one of my favorite games i think i've played over the last couple of years

1356
06:25:56,659 --> 06:26:02,900
now here's the thing about vr that's a little strange and i get it this seems like there are

1357
06:26:05,349 --> 06:26:11,909
it seems like all these vr games are kind of like two to three hour experiences and they're all

1358
06:26:12,709 --> 06:26:21,290
between 15 and 25 dollars if super hot vr was a 60 dollar game and was like another three or four

1359
06:26:21,290 --> 06:26:25,290
maybe five hours of content maybe like another three hours of content even even if it was a

1360
06:26:26,169 --> 06:26:34,099
four to five hour vr experience i think i would be worth it but nobody's like making full on

1361
06:26:34,099 --> 06:26:41,860
complete vr games because probably that market share just isn't there and maybe people can only

1362
06:26:41,860 --> 06:26:49,110
play them for so long right but man if i if i could pay 60 bucks for two and a half times

1363
06:26:49,110 --> 06:26:52,869
the content that was in super hot vr that'd be one of my probably favorite games ever made

1364
06:26:53,669 --> 06:26:59,029
i'm not kidding around that's not a joke you know like ocarina of time no no no bump it off the

1365
06:26:59,029 --> 06:27:04,889
list see you later you add like two to three more hours of of actual campaign content in

1366
06:27:04,889 --> 06:27:13,560
super hot vr make it like a 40 to 50 60 dollar game that's one of my favorite games ever made

1367
06:27:13,560 --> 06:27:18,520
market share is a big word for you they used to trade cryptocurrency you don't think i know what

1368
06:27:18,520 --> 06:27:37,419
that word means he finally admitted it what are you guys know that i have an emote that is a coin

1369
06:27:39,450 --> 06:27:45,930
that was that why is it some now quit talking about cryptocurrency somebody just said it

1370
06:27:45,930 --> 06:27:49,689
but the thing is before i wasn't okay we're gonna move on because i wasn't talking about

1371
06:27:49,689 --> 06:27:54,169
it before and somebody accused me of talking about it before i don't talk about it anymore

1372
06:27:54,169 --> 06:27:59,560
it's a goddamn bear market and i'm not going to talk about that in a bear market

1373
06:28:00,360 --> 06:28:07,700
oh he knows what that word is that means that instead of uh it's a it's bull and bear

1374
06:28:08,709 --> 06:28:14,729
now how that works is in wall street instead of humans there are bears in suits that go in there

1375
06:28:15,369 --> 06:28:18,650
they're all dressed up and they trade for a little while that's like a bear market they're

1376
06:28:18,650 --> 06:28:23,130
allowed to be in there for a few months and then they let the the bears out when they're done

1377
06:28:23,130 --> 06:28:26,970
because they have to hibernate and the bulls come in and then they put on suits and shit and it's

1378
06:28:26,970 --> 06:28:42,220
animals no bull is up bear is down you don't think i know this stuff you want to know what

1379
06:28:42,220 --> 06:28:56,150
market cap means i'll give you a whole course stay after the credits that sounds like a furry party

1380
06:28:56,150 --> 06:29:08,700
okay i'm gonna laugh my ass off okay okay if i said that i was gonna do a financial course after

1381
06:29:08,700 --> 06:29:14,840
the credits and i was gonna explain market cap after the credits were over i wonder how many

1382
06:29:14,840 --> 06:29:23,580
people leave i'm not a financial advisor why did i say that never said that but yes uh back to i

1383
06:29:23,580 --> 06:29:33,189
don't know how that even got there but vr is great it's definitely worth it super hot vr was

1384
06:29:34,069 --> 06:29:42,409
unbelievably good to a point where i'm angry about it i am upset that super hot vr is something

1385
06:29:42,409 --> 06:29:46,250
that i can't play anymore because i mean i could go back and like beat all the levels and try to

1386
06:29:46,250 --> 06:29:52,810
get really good at them do the speed run stuff but i beat it in about an hour and 32 minutes

1387
06:29:53,450 --> 06:29:58,360
and it was one of my favorite things i've done in the last couple years take that how you will

jet island looks absolutely bonkers to play i hope to eventually get a vr set up

1411
06:34:02,840 --> 06:34:06,919
on an unrelated note i was wondering what your policy is on fan meetups i'm actually going to

1412
06:34:06,919 --> 06:34:12,520
be in vegas this weekend with my dad my 21st birthday happy 21st birthday i was hoping to

1413
06:34:12,520 --> 06:34:15,720
meet up at some point but since you're streaming all weekend that i won't worry about it much

1414
06:34:16,279 --> 06:34:20,119
hope i have as much fun in vegas as you do in vr well i can tell you right now

1415
06:34:20,919 --> 06:34:28,840
i don't do them i don't do fan meetups i don't do meet and greets unless very specifically

1416
06:34:29,400 --> 06:34:39,159
they are on a convention floor like a twitchcon a pax east pax west e3 i don't do meetups

1417
06:34:41,110 --> 06:34:43,509
i mean i guess this is like probably a handful of reasons why

1418
06:34:44,310 --> 06:35:02,709
terma just let us in your house he can't get the pass to conventions what but no i don't

1419
06:35:02,709 --> 06:35:12,279
i like to kind of here here's let me give you the long and short of it here so let's say that you

1420
06:35:12,279 --> 06:35:17,319
and i hung out tomorrow right all right i'm coming down i'll see you in a minute let's hang out and

1421
06:35:17,319 --> 06:35:23,209
let's let's play roulette you know whatever you would be doing let's go to dinner essentially

1422
06:35:23,209 --> 06:35:31,849
what i'm doing is i'm like i'm opening myself up to a stranger you know what i mean it's not

1423
06:35:31,849 --> 06:35:37,130
like i don't not like you're a stranger stranger you've been on the stream you write text i see

1424
06:35:37,130 --> 06:35:44,709
you in chat but i don't personally like to kind of open myself up to somebody that i don't know in

1425
06:35:44,709 --> 06:35:49,529
real life unless it was at a place that i was comfortable going to like a convention where

1426
06:35:49,529 --> 06:35:58,889
we're all there for the same reason anyways and that's nothing against anybody that ever wants

1427
06:35:58,970 --> 06:36:03,770
to say hello there's been plenty of people that have just you know happened to see me on the

1428
06:36:03,770 --> 06:36:11,380
street even here like it's happened it's happened like at least twice in vegas and that's great

1429
06:36:11,380 --> 06:36:15,700
that's fine that's fine but like specifically planning to go like hang out with somebody

1430
06:36:15,700 --> 06:36:21,669
is something i will never do it just it's never gonna happen so maybe that can be like a blanket

1431
06:36:21,669 --> 06:36:33,580
statement i think but if we're at a convention or you happen to see me on the street or you happen

1432
06:36:33,580 --> 06:36:37,819
to just know that i'm here and you ran into me somehow i was at like some place on the strip or

1433
06:36:37,819 --> 06:36:47,209
in downtown or wherever that do not take this as a leave me the fuck alone no it's just specific

1434
06:36:48,009 --> 06:37:09,750
hangouts or something i will never do hey you want to hang out at chili's i just want to hang

1435
06:37:09,750 --> 06:37:20,119
out at your house and eat pizza rolls no because i mean i look i do have to be on top of that because

1436
06:37:22,020 --> 06:37:25,540
you know you just never know you never know what somebody's intentions are what they will you know

1437
06:37:25,540 --> 06:37:31,270
what they want out of that you know if somebody has then like oh maybe like i maybe i have your

1438
06:37:31,270 --> 06:37:36,790
phone number now i got your phone number it just gets i don't want it to ever get to that place

1439
06:37:37,509 --> 06:37:42,869
but we'll move on from it just know that if you don't see me at a convention

1440
06:37:43,669 --> 06:37:49,979
uh i do meetups pretty much at any convention i ever go to but that's where i'm gonna leave it

1489
06:44:36,119 --> 06:44:41,959
many things to do it sucks because that i have this finite amount of time in vr where i know

1490
06:44:41,959 --> 06:44:48,419
i'm only going to be able to do it for four to five hours straight there's so many pieces of

1491
06:44:48,419 --> 06:44:54,500
content that i need to stuff in there and then come up for air and do it again another time

1492
06:44:55,930 --> 06:45:10,779
i wish it didn't kill me but it does but i love it plays geoguessr and shitty flash games won't

1495
06:45:22,520 --> 06:45:31,139
in doing i don't have a current interest in black mesa really at all so all i would be doing

1496
06:45:32,020 --> 06:45:39,319
was just forcing myself to pretend to be interested in black mesa to stream it you know what i'm

1497
06:45:39,319 --> 06:45:47,139
saying like that i don't i don't click with me don't click with me that's just the truth

1498
06:45:47,139 --> 06:46:02,250

1510
06:47:47,139 --> 06:48:01,220
to figure out a good game to do it i already vetoed uh grounds why do i think the name of that game

1511
06:48:01,220 --> 06:48:13,299
is grounds for divorce grounds for what was it called getting over it what where did that come

1512
06:48:13,299 --> 06:48:28,490
from getting over it i vetoed that because if i he already has a ton of time and it's not fair

1513
06:48:28,490 --> 06:48:34,330
we bet we have to both go in blind to a highly skilled video game that neither one of us have

1514
06:48:34,330 --> 06:48:44,680
played and we'll be good to go i'm just gonna figure out which one that is what's the punishment

1663
07:12:44,340 --> 07:12:53,020

1665
07:13:00,299 --> 07:13:06,279
in front of the sign out front and it's actually a chili's because they're the same restaurant and

1666
07:13:06,279 --> 07:13:11,000
i could have just said that chilies and tgi fridays are the same restaurant there's no

1667
07:13:11,000 --> 07:13:22,700
differences you eat blindfolded out of chilies and eat blindfolded at tgi fridays the even the way

1668
07:13:22,700 --> 07:13:31,619
that people talk to you is the same what a walk that story was yeah first of all i could yeah i

1669
07:13:31,619 --> 07:13:34,419
blindfold you and then you come on in and i sit you know in a restaurant you get the fish and chips

1670
07:13:34,419 --> 07:13:43,909
that none of that matters i just gave you like five anime filler episodes for one punch in a

1671
07:13:43,909 --> 07:13:56,169
fight scene not even the whole thing i don't ask me what i why i did that but anyways uh thank you

to the end here thank you tingy for the two dollars and 51 cents i found a penny from my last message

1674
07:14:11,770 --> 07:14:17,049
it took me a while because canada doesn't use pennies anymore so i had to search for one found

1675
07:14:17,049 --> 07:14:22,650
it in some snow after my dog sled went over it and fell to bump while on my way to tim hortons for

1676
07:14:22,650 --> 07:14:36,040
a double double is that canada doesn't have pennies anymore they took him out of circulation

1677
07:14:41,930 --> 07:14:47,139
yeah okay so you eat it chilies you see you go down you have the fish and chips you're like oh

1678
07:14:47,139 --> 07:14:51,540
this is like this fish and chips just you're like crunching it tastes weird this is like really kind

1679
07:14:51,540 --> 07:14:57,459
of gross it tastes really off to me and you take a sip and you're like oh that's also off what the

1680
07:14:57,459 --> 07:15:02,020
fuck is going on this is disgusting and i take you outside the blindfold still on you i spin you

1681
07:15:02,020 --> 07:15:06,340
around i take the blindfold off it says tga fridays or chilies you're like oh tga fridays

1682
07:15:06,340 --> 07:15:16,229
i dropped the fucking veil it's pbr you've been eating and drinking pbr that's why you said that

1683
07:15:16,229 --> 07:15:22,619
hey commando thanks for the four dollars commando nam i got in a heated argument with my friend

1684
07:15:22,619 --> 07:15:29,060
today about what's better halo 2 or call of duty 2 i choose halo 2 and he chose call of duty 2

1685
07:15:29,060 --> 07:15:41,180
the worst call of duty world war 2 game of all time um i mean you kind of have to go with halo

1686
07:15:41,180 --> 07:15:53,990
2 halo 2 did a lot to define multiplayer shooters it was you know linking up with your friends and

1687
07:15:53,990 --> 07:16:04,599
playing it was halo 2 was like the golden eye of that generation of continuing the fps genre

1688
07:16:04,599 --> 07:16:08,380
that makes sense right then you're not going to pull my like my my skin off my face and it's

1689
07:16:08,380 --> 07:16:24,520
like a pbr under there that's a good point but yeah i'd say call i mean call of duty is

1690
07:16:25,319 --> 07:16:30,659
there's just too many of them it's the same thing like i don't understand like

1691
07:16:30,659 --> 07:16:36,819
battlefield five came out and what the heck it's not doing it's not selling as well as we wanted

1692
07:16:36,819 --> 07:16:44,580
it to just stop making those make a different video game i don't understand so you got battlefield

1693
07:16:44,580 --> 07:16:55,740
four battlefield one battlefield five what's next battlefield six i just do a different do something

1694
07:16:55,900 --> 07:17:02,939
else but i have an idea let's do battlefield again but star wars just give dice has one of

1695
07:17:02,939 --> 07:17:10,729
the best fucking engines in the entire country i'm talking all countries that frostbite engine is

1696
07:17:10,729 --> 07:17:19,740
insane get you do a different ip do something else but this time we're gonna put planes in it

1697
07:17:19,740 --> 07:17:25,319
i don't get that it was really great fucking battlefield was amazing some of those new

1698
07:17:25,319 --> 07:17:30,790
generation battlefields were were so like a real battlefield moment i know what you're talking

1699
07:17:30,790 --> 07:17:41,659
about but you don't think it's time to like hang up the battlefield coat and get a new coat you

1700
07:17:41,659 --> 07:17:51,860
don't even have to throw it away you can put it in the attic i would love it i would love dice

1701
07:17:52,659 --> 07:18:05,720
to do something else i don't know and this is just my this is my just fucking bread opinion

1702
07:18:06,279 --> 07:18:14,729
but i feel the same way about call of duty too activision hired three different studios to pump

1703
07:18:14,729 --> 07:18:19,770
them out over and over again it's like why don't you just like combine those three studios collective

1704
07:18:19,770 --> 07:18:25,560
intelligence quotients and the three of you come up with a fucking new great experience have it

1705
07:18:25,560 --> 07:18:34,229
pass around the office does cod still is that still a sell point does cod still sell that much

1706
07:18:34,950 --> 07:18:41,720
that you still have the three teams on it does it i don't think i feel like it doesn't it does

1707
07:18:42,360 --> 07:18:57,900
but yeah i mean i would love to see the creative people that are behind some of these games

1708
07:18:58,619 --> 07:19:10,340
just do something else call it is almost a guaranteed casual shooter pick up

1709
07:19:10,340 --> 07:19:21,319
yeah blops four he's been crazy popular maybe i'm just old and fucking out of touch but i

1710
07:19:21,319 --> 07:19:25,080
remember well i was about to just grab the mic and scream banjo kazooie into the mic

1711
07:19:25,720 --> 07:19:29,720
i was gonna go banjo kazooie when that came out i was gonna scream it good thing i didn't

1712
07:19:29,720 --> 07:19:43,700
a lot of talented people in this industry i feel like just making the next jason movie is not

1713
07:19:43,700 --> 07:19:49,110
another way to use the resources there but that's just me you know and i can't put the frog though

1714
07:19:50,069 --> 07:20:08,939
you know that one uh almost at the end germ is still waiting for half-life three

1715
07:20:10,009 --> 07:20:21,400
yeah it'd be nice it'd be cool they pop them up because battlefield and cod makes money and

1716
07:20:21,400 --> 07:20:40,380
they're safe yeah i guess turn up the music sonny oh is it low it's not even on you're right money

1717
07:20:40,380 --> 07:20:50,630
talks well let's hope that phil spencer after buying like 38 studios maybe they'll make

1718
07:20:50,630 --> 07:21:05,900
something together all right where the hell were we just what do they make my own game company

1719
07:21:06,540 --> 07:21:14,659
the first thing i'm gonna make is gonna be an ant simulator massive multiplayer you get one life

1720
07:21:14,659 --> 07:21:22,259
as a bug you could you could spawn as an ant right everybody's an ant just like a 500 000 people

1721
07:21:22,259 --> 07:21:27,220
servers you could do it because the amount of data required for an ant that doesn't do anything

1722
07:21:27,220 --> 07:21:32,939
besides eat and walk in your hands can work you could have a million people in that server

1723
07:21:33,500 --> 07:21:40,250
and you all have to work towards getting the queen more babies and then you can colonize and

1724
07:21:40,250 --> 07:21:54,650
like fight each other you could do it you can level up become like a worker ant and then a

1725
07:21:54,650 --> 07:21:59,529
flying ant you could even go as far as you could have like different skill trees like red ant

1726
07:22:00,250 --> 07:22:06,950
when you bite somebody it's one point of fire damage per tick for 10 seconds i do consulting

1727
07:22:06,950 --> 07:22:13,619
work just give me just give me money and i'll do it just one of these game companies hit me up

1728
07:22:13,619 --> 07:22:19,669
i'll take a 15 million dollar check one damage one damage per fire of tick that's worth a lot

1729
07:22:25,099 --> 07:22:29,259
i'm getting i'm like i'm i'm in one of those moods i don't know why it popped up after being

1730
07:22:29,259 --> 07:22:36,419
out of vr i think it's because i'm like allowed to breathe now when you become a hundred you get

1731
07:22:36,419 --> 07:22:50,540
you a queen yeah i can't wait to floss as an ant all right let's just let's do the bit somebody

1732
07:22:50,540 --> 07:22:54,060
said something about a penny and then we ended up there no no no it was uh call of duty 2 versus

1733
07:22:54,060 --> 07:23:00,819
halo i'd say halo too but that's just me thank you nate for the three dollars hey what about
