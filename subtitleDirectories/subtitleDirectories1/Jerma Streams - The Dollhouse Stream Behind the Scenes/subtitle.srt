1
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:50,299
And I'm gonna be showing you guys some of my favorite things.

2
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:54,250
So, let's get started.

3
00:01:31,670 --> 00:02:04,659
Hello! What's up? How are you? That was pretty cool. That's the first time I've seen that.

4
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:07,659
Yeah, it was fun, right? Vinnie put that together for us.

5
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:11,159
I haven't seen any of these. So, I've seen, like, a few.

6
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:13,159
But, hi guys, welcome.

7
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:16,099
That was awesome.

8
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:18,340
My, like, heart is like...

9
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,340
Oh, it's beating out of my chest!

10
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,340
That was unbelievable.

11
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,349
First time I've seen that.

12
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:27,349
Introduce yourselves. These are two very important people.

13
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:29,349
Yeah, so, I'm Jake.

14
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:32,349
I'm the owner of JK Productions.

15
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:35,349
And Community Jake, as you may know me.

16
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:37,349
Jeremy's manager.

17
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:39,349
And, yeah.

18
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:41,590
I put together this show.

19
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,590
Jeremy's incredible idea.

20
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:47,590
And I have Alex here, my right-hand man, who was in charge of all the tech.

21
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,590
So, if you want to say hi.

22
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,590
Hi, my name's Alex. Yeah, I was the director for the dollhouse.

23
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:57,590
So, any of the technology that wasn't from the extension was something that my group was working on.

24
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,590
And that we'll talk about tonight.

25
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:05,050
Also, these two guys were responsible for more than just this.

26
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:08,659
Archaeology. Thank these two.

27
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:12,569
Bugleberry's hot tub. These guys.

28
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:15,870
Even before that, the Halloween stream. These guys.

29
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,110
So, they've been around for a long time.

30
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,740
And, of course, the carnival.

31
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,740
Oh, yeah, absolutely. The carnival. I can't, how did I forget that?

32
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:26,180
But, they've been...

33
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,180
These are the people behind the shit that you see.

34
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,659
So, they're in the flesh here.

35
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:32,659
Yeah, and I'm really excited tonight.

36
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:34,659
We're segmenting the show into three parts.

37
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:38,659
So, the first part of the show is about the pre-production of Dollhouse.

38
00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:40,659
Sort of how it came to be.

39
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:46,659
And then, the second part of the show is about what the Dollhouse production was like.

40
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,659
So, while it was happening.

41
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:50,659
What was it like sort of behind the scenes.

42
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:53,659
And then, the third part of the show is with our talent.

43
00:03:53,659 --> 00:03:58,659
Where we talk about the content and how we came up with things.

44
00:03:58,659 --> 00:04:00,659
Like, different segments on the show.

45
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:03,659
And how a lot of it, most of it, sort of happened on the fly.

46
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:06,659
Like, as chat made their decisions and that sort of thing.

47
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:10,659
And how we, you know, developed our beats and all that sort of stuff.

48
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:12,659
So, I'm pretty excited. We have a ton.

49
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:14,659
We have way more footage than we could possibly show.

50
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:16,660
There's a lot of clips.

51
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,660
There's like hundreds.

52
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,829
We've cut down well over 100 hours of footage.

53
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:25,829
Down to, I don't know, maybe 90 minutes or so.

54
00:04:25,829 --> 00:04:27,829
And we're probably not even going to get to show all of it tonight.

55
00:04:27,829 --> 00:04:29,829
We don't usually get to talk about this side too.

56
00:04:29,829 --> 00:04:31,829
So, this will be for people to see.

57
00:04:31,829 --> 00:04:36,399
Also, on the second channel.

58
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:41,279
The second channel is going to be like a cut down documentary, essentially, right?

59
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:43,279
Yeah, so we're doing the...

60
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:45,459
Even if you don't see it today, you'll see some of it later.

61
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:50,949
Yeah, we're doing the normal second drama cuts of each episode.

62
00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:52,949
And then we'll be doing a behind the scenes cut too.

63
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:55,949
That's like the super cut of all of this stuff together.

64
00:04:55,949 --> 00:05:00,579
So, even if there's stuff we don't get to show today, hopefully it'll show up there.

65
00:05:00,579 --> 00:05:02,579
Release the cut. Release the cut.

66
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:06,009
No, not yet. Not until I get my hands on it.

67
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:10,000
It'll be six hours.

68
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
With us today, in the first part of the show here, we have Nick Lawrence from Andy Mark.

69
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,879
I want that to happen.

70
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:23,439
We've got Nick Lawrence from Andy Mark. If you want to say hi, Nick.

71
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:25,439
Hey, everybody. My name is Nick Lawrence.

72
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:29,439
I usually work for Andy Mark as a mechanical engineering person,

73
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:36,439
but also in a small group of people that get to do really fun, super special projects like the dollhouse.

74
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:41,439
And it was a total blast. One of the coolest things I've ever, ever, ever worked on.

75
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:45,149
Yeah, and also carnival stuff too.

76
00:05:45,149 --> 00:05:49,839
So, all the robots, that's these guys. They did that too.

77
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:53,019
So, they were responsible for so much stuff.

78
00:05:53,019 --> 00:06:01,899
And I cannot say, I can say it a million times, but you guys are worth going to a million times over.

79
00:06:01,899 --> 00:06:10,990
I would rather use the Andy Mark people over like the highest quality studio in Los Angeles.

80
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:11,990
A hundred times.

81
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,860
That's really, really kind.

82
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,860
There's no way we'd be able to find.

83
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:24,180
I just want to say in front of everybody that we super appreciate the opportunity, and we had a blast doing it for sure.

84
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,740
We look forward to more.

85
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,980
Yeah, oh yeah. There will be plenty more. That's for sure.

86
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:33,120
So, I think to start us off.

87
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,000
There's a cat.

88
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Oh yeah, there's a cat. Cat sliding down.

89
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Simon's planning a place. That's it for the stream.

90
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:48,500
I think to start off this section, I'm going to show a few renders, photos real quick.

91
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:54,500
And then we're going to jump into a tour that I gave to our BTS op, Vinny.

92
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:59,500
And we can kind of skip through that and see what it was like on set there.

93
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:10,930
But to get us started, this was like a super early render of what the space looked like in the mind of the engineers over at Andy Mark.

94
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:20,100
And as you can see, we had this idea about we want this dollhouse to be two floors.

95
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:24,100
We want there to be, it needs to be more than just a bunch of sets.

96
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:29,100
And we talked about having disconnected sets, where it's like, okay, well, we can pretend that they're upstairs.

97
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,100
We can use some camera magic to superimpose them upstairs or whatever.

98
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:37,100
And at least I was pretty consistent that it needed to be a house.

99
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:41,100
It needed to be a two-story house for us to have the effect that we wanted it to have.

100
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:52,759
And so as much as it annoyed everyone, I think, to be insistent on that, this is sort of what we came up with.

101
00:07:52,759 --> 00:08:02,129
And so looking at it, these are some renders that we had of inside the warehouse, because the roof in the warehouse isn't really that tall.

102
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:07,129
And so we had some issues with how high the truss can be and where the lights needed to be and all that sort of thing.

103
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:13,129
You could see, like in overhead here, we have the upper rooms and the forward rooms are actually set back.

104
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:21,129
The upper rooms are set back, which is why when you see that full house view, the upper rooms look smaller because they're 20 feet back from those lower rooms.

105
00:08:21,129 --> 00:08:25,129
But it really is necessary in order to shoot that way.

106
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:29,129
And to light the space, right, to be able to light something without having a floor on top of it.

107
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:36,129
And you're talking about a building where at some points in this building, the roof is only 23 or 24 feet and the set itself is 18 feet.

108
00:08:36,129 --> 00:08:40,129
So there was a lot of kind of camera tricks and light tricks to make the items look correct.

109
00:08:40,129 --> 00:08:42,129
And to have the forced perspective for the walls.

110
00:08:42,129 --> 00:08:45,129
You really need to feel like you can see what's on a wall, right?

111
00:08:45,129 --> 00:08:49,129
You can't build a 90 degree wall or you wouldn't be able to tell what you were placing.

112
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:51,129
They're like this, right? Like that?

113
00:08:51,129 --> 00:08:52,129
Yeah.

114
00:08:52,129 --> 00:08:53,129
Essentially, they're like right up.

115
00:08:53,129 --> 00:08:54,940
Yeah, that was definitely.

116
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,940
Originally, I was going to go out the top floor window.

117
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:03,080
That was the first idea was, oh, I want to go out the second floor window, not the bottom floor.

118
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,450
That was the plan.

119
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:05,450
That was the plan.

120
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:08,450
How the fuck are we going to have you go out of the second floor window?

121
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,450
I was like, I don't know, figure it out.

122
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,940
And then I like walked out of the room.

123
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:21,309
Yeah, Nick, if you want to say anything about those forced perspective rooms, because that idea was the genius, I think, behind how we were able to shoot this.

124
00:09:21,309 --> 00:09:22,309
And that totally came from your group.

125
00:09:22,309 --> 00:09:25,000
Yeah, definitely.

126
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
There's a lot of people.

127
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I mean, I'm just one of the team.

128
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I mean, Liz and Ren and Brett, really the other corporate owner team that all have a lot of artsy theater perspective.

129
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And they really kind of drove the shapes of the rooms from our end.

130
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And they were like, yeah, like every set ever.

131
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
They got the rooms open so you can see the stuff on the walls, which makes it so much easier to shoot and see like, you know, grandma spoons on the walls.

132
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:57,169
You can actually see them instead of having to like bring cameras way around and see the detailing of the doors opening and the window openings all of them.

133
00:09:57,169 --> 00:10:02,169
Yeah, it's funny that like when the project was pitched to us, we were like, you want two stories, right?

134
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:03,169
OK, so we're going to fake this, right?

135
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,169
And you're like, no, it's got to be two stories.

136
00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:08,169
OK, so it's two stories we got.

137
00:10:08,169 --> 00:10:12,539
Yeah, you can actually see the real life one here.

138
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:20,399
The walls on the kitchen room and the bathroom room were kind of tapered together here.

139
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,899
Now you can see the walls kind of tapering open, which is pretty neat.

140
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:32,899
One of the things we had to be super careful of, you can see in this, is the tops of all the alleyways are just fabric.

141
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:39,899
They just needed to be black and we had to be super careful like to remind people to not step on them because it wasn't like it wasn't a flooring.

142
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:43,779
So it definitely caught me up a little bit while I was doing painting.

143
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:51,950
Yeah, I almost fell and died actually once during the setup of the show.

144
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:56,950
One of the things that we super had to care about was safety, right?

145
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:08,190
And we way, way, way overbuilt that upper level because, you know, when we were planning the show at one point, we thought that there might be as many as like 15, 20, even 30 people in one room.

146
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:11,190
Plus, Jack could have placed all the furniture in one room.

147
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:15,190
So we had to deal with like thousands of pounds of payload and make sure it was safe.

148
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:20,190
Right. So it's like all the structure underneath is like way, way, way overbuilt for your average house.

149
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:24,190
Yeah, let's let's get the tour video started. We could pause it along the way to point out some of that stuff, I think.

150
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:26,190
Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.

151
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:34,139
Yeah, so this is the set and it's a yard.

152
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:40,320
We consider the yard to be a room because it's a place where Jack can put things and, you know, it's on camera.

153
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,320
People can interact there and stuff.

154
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,320
But on day one, we just have rooms four and five.

155
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,320
They're number one, two, three, four, five, six.

156
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,320
So rooms four and five are the yellow rooms.

157
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,320
I think this is probably five or six days before air reference time.

158
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:00,320
The yellow room will be, on day one, the entire living space.

159
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,389
When did you guys finish it?

160
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:07,389
Like, when was it ready to go? How far before the stream?

161
00:12:07,389 --> 00:12:10,080
What time did the stream start?

162
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:15,080
Three o'clock on Wednesday.

163
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:20,080
I mean, when I walked in, I was like, holy shit, this is ready.

164
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,080
And I think that you had just barely finished.

165
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:28,820
People don't realize that all this was potentially finished not even a week before the stream started.

166
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:34,820
Yeah, one week before the stream started is the day that we got the delivery of our tech rental.

167
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:38,820
So all that truss work and lighting and stuff that you see was one week before stream.

168
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,820
And so actually, I think six days before stream.

169
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,820
So all of the tech got built and then all the finishing.

170
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:48,820
I mean, you'll see in this tour, the state of the rooms, this is still probably three days before air.

171
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:55,700
And then when we're there, the colors of the doors and all that will be, I guess.

172
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,700
So Chad will have a little bit of a challenge trying to figure out how to make it work.

173
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:04,700
Room five here is the bathroom.

174
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:10,700
And the bathroom is smaller than every other room in the house, but it's still quite large for a bathroom,

175
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:19,700
which Chad seemed to notice on the Sims 3 stream that we did earlier this month.

176
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:23,700
So yeah, we've got like a shower, a toilet, a little vanity and stuff.

177
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,700
But there's so much room in here that on that first day,

178
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:31,700
we wouldn't be surprised to see a bed in here or some other furniture in here

179
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,700
because there's not a ton of room in that other room.

180
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,700
And we think that's kind of funny.

181
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:40,700
Over here, room six, this is probably a bedroom.

182
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,700
I think we're calling it a bedroom in the software.

183
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,700
But again, you know, Chad can kind of do what they want.

184
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:50,700
Now the yellow room becomes...

185
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,700
I don't know if you go, I haven't seen this video yet.

186
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,700
So I don't know if you go into further detail,

187
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,700
but you can see one of the monitors that's behind the window to make the background there.

188
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,700
Do you show that a little later in this video?

189
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,700
Yeah, I think we see the back of them a little bit later.

190
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:07,700
But yeah, there were in total, I think we bought over 20 TVs

191
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,700
between the small ones and the big ones to make this set of reality.

192
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:15,700
So I think that the windows, the TVs in the windows,

193
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,700
was just an amazing effect that it was such a small touch.

194
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,700
I was hoping people caught it.

195
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,700
It brought it all together, yeah.

196
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,700
The rain, the fire, the day, night.

197
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,700
Someone sitting there controlling the weather

198
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,700
to make it correspond with the graphic of the house

199
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,700
and what's going on with the day-night cycle, right?

200
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,059
So it's one of those details that...

201
00:14:34,059 --> 00:14:36,059
I'll skip forward a little bit here.

202
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:38,059
We're talking about these windows.

203
00:14:39,059 --> 00:14:42,059
And there's also that window in the front.

204
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:44,059
So if we go and take a look at that window.

205
00:14:44,059 --> 00:14:48,059
And so this is where the burglar is going to come through.

206
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:51,059
But because all these walls are double walls

207
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:53,059
in order to create the forced perspective,

208
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,059
it's a little awkward because the burglar is going to have to...

209
00:14:55,059 --> 00:14:57,059
Now you see how hard it was to climb through that.

210
00:14:57,059 --> 00:14:58,059
...step inside here.

211
00:14:58,059 --> 00:15:00,059
And then have to climb out the other, yeah.

212
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:01,059
Exactly.

213
00:15:01,059 --> 00:15:03,059
But I think it's also kind of funny.

214
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:05,059
I'm not bothered by it.

215
00:15:05,059 --> 00:15:06,059
I think it's going to be...

216
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:07,059
That'll work.

217
00:15:07,059 --> 00:15:11,059
And then on day three, we add rooms one and two.

218
00:15:11,059 --> 00:15:14,059
Room one becomes the bedroom,

219
00:15:14,059 --> 00:15:16,059
which is that kind of maroon room up there.

220
00:15:16,059 --> 00:15:19,059
And room six, which was that blue room,

221
00:15:19,059 --> 00:15:21,059
now becomes the living room.

222
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:23,059
So this is really just the kitchen.

223
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:27,059
And then the room two is that unfinished room up there

224
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:31,059
with that closet wall in the back.

225
00:15:31,059 --> 00:15:36,059
And so the storyline goes that at the end of day two,

226
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:37,059
the house burns down,

227
00:15:37,059 --> 00:15:39,059
and Jeremy collects the insurance money for it,

228
00:15:39,059 --> 00:15:42,059
and he gets to buy a bigger house.

229
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:43,059
So he buys this bigger house,

230
00:15:43,059 --> 00:15:45,059
but it has this room that was never finished.

231
00:15:45,059 --> 00:15:47,059
And so he wants to finish the room,

232
00:15:47,059 --> 00:15:49,059
to turn it into an office or something like that.

233
00:15:49,059 --> 00:15:53,059
And so he goes up there and cleans all the junk out of it,

234
00:15:53,059 --> 00:15:55,059
and he starts working on it

235
00:15:55,059 --> 00:15:57,059
and accidentally kills his neighbor's power

236
00:15:57,059 --> 00:15:58,059
in the process of doing that.

237
00:15:58,059 --> 00:16:00,059
And the neighbor comes over

238
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:02,059
and says, what the hell is going on here?

239
00:16:02,059 --> 00:16:04,059
And offers to help him finish the room.

240
00:16:04,059 --> 00:16:08,059
And the other change for day three is in room three here.

241
00:16:08,059 --> 00:16:09,059
What's that?

242
00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:11,690
It said, scripted Saul, somebody said.

243
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:12,690
Yeah.

244
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:15,690
Well, the thing is, we had, yeah, you can take this one,

245
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:16,690
because we had a few things

246
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:19,690
that were actually absolutely going to happen.

247
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:21,690
Yeah, so it was important for us to understand

248
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,690
how we were going to get from one day to the next,

249
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:26,690
because the idea was that we wanted the house to get bigger

250
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:27,690
from day one to day two,

251
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,690
and then we wanted to blow everybody's minds

252
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:33,690
by making the house two stories for the third day.

253
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:36,690
And so we had to come up with a storyline that made sense

254
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:39,990
to get us from day one to day two to day three.

255
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,990
And we had a few of these technical things

256
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:43,990
that we wanted to happen

257
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:47,169
that we needed to know how they were going to happen

258
00:16:47,169 --> 00:16:48,169
in order for them to work.

259
00:16:48,169 --> 00:16:50,169
And the great example of that is the fire

260
00:16:50,169 --> 00:16:51,169
at the end of day two.

261
00:16:51,169 --> 00:16:53,169
We knew we wanted to have a house fire.

262
00:16:53,169 --> 00:16:54,169
We knew that we wanted,

263
00:16:54,169 --> 00:16:57,169
that's like a very Sims thing, have a house fire.

264
00:16:57,169 --> 00:16:58,169
We knew we wanted to have a house fire,

265
00:16:58,169 --> 00:17:02,169
and we also knew that Jeremy wanted to go out a window.

266
00:17:02,169 --> 00:17:05,339
And so coupling those two things together

267
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:08,339
actually didn't happen until Jeremy was on site.

268
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:10,339
We knew that Jeremy was going to go out the window,

269
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:12,339
but we didn't know how or why he was going to go out the window

270
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:15,339
until it was like pretty much the day before the shoot,

271
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:17,519
and it was like, okay, why is Jeremy going out the window?

272
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:18,519
How is he going out the window?

273
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:20,519
And that's when we talked about the fire

274
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:22,519
and rehearsed the fire and blocked the fire out

275
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:23,519
in order to make that happen.

276
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:26,519
And so the fire was the natural storyline about

277
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:28,519
you get insurance money, you buy a bigger house,

278
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:30,519
or you rebuild your house or whatever it is

279
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:33,519
to get that huge house on day three.

280
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,519
What we didn't know, for example, is we didn't,

281
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:38,519
the call came from Chap for when he would make the food

282
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:39,519
that started the sequence for the fire.

283
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:41,519
So we didn't know where the fire would happen.

284
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,519
We knew it would be related to making food,

285
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:45,519
but ultimately we had to place it somewhere

286
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:47,519
when Chap had decided to make food

287
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,519
where it was the right time for it to catch on fire.

288
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:51,519
So Chap was still involved in that decision, right,

289
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:53,519
of like the food decision was made

290
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:55,519
and that started the sequence.

291
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:57,519
Yeah, and there's so many decisions.

292
00:17:57,519 --> 00:17:59,519
There's so many different pathways

293
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:01,519
of things that we had thought about

294
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:03,519
where it's like, well, yeah,

295
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:06,519
what are the different things that they could choose?

296
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:08,519
And we kind of planned for all three different options.

297
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:10,519
And then it's like, well, if they pick this one,

298
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:12,519
then what are some more things that they could choose?

299
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:14,519
And so there's like dozens of storylines

300
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:17,519
that did not play out because of how Chap chose them.

301
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:19,519
But as you'll see, as we kind of go through this,

302
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,519
the reality of the situation is that you have to,

303
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:24,519
you have to have some pre-planning

304
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:26,519
and have some of these more complicated things are executed.

305
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:28,519
In order for them to work.

306
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:30,519
And a great example is the window shatter, right?

307
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:34,170
Which was something that had to happen.

308
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:36,980
For sure.

309
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,660
People say my mic is fucked up. Does that sound bad?

310
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,829
Sounds good to me.

311
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:47,059
Sounds weird.

312
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:49,369
So this is prop storage.

313
00:18:49,369 --> 00:18:51,369
And it's kind of laid out by room.

314
00:18:51,369 --> 00:18:55,700
We're here, couch is over here,

315
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,700
bed is stuck over there,

316
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,700
chair is over here.

317
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,700
So as Chap purchases things,

318
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,700
the people in the morph suit movers will come back here,

319
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,700
pick the item,

320
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,700
and then we'll go through the front door

321
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,700
and install the item inside the house,

322
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,700
wherever Chap said to put it,

323
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,700
or as close to it as possible.

324
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,700
And this is where Nick was talking about

325
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,700
those trusses overhead.

326
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,069
Yeah, those are on like 12 inch spacing,

327
00:19:22,069 --> 00:19:24,069
which is kind of absurd for floor trussing.

328
00:19:26,069 --> 00:19:28,069
You can see it was, I mean,

329
00:19:28,069 --> 00:19:30,069
the rooms are like 16 foot square,

330
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:32,069
so there's this very long unsupported span

331
00:19:32,069 --> 00:19:34,069
that we had to deal with.

332
00:19:34,069 --> 00:19:36,069
So we ran crap tons of these,

333
00:19:36,069 --> 00:19:38,069
engineered wooden eye beams

334
00:19:38,069 --> 00:19:40,069
to support the weight of that.

335
00:19:40,069 --> 00:19:42,069
But it also created this nice cavity

336
00:19:42,069 --> 00:19:44,069
where we could put prop storage.

337
00:19:44,069 --> 00:19:46,069
And the size of the upstairs

338
00:19:46,069 --> 00:19:48,069
was driven by the building more than anything.

339
00:19:48,069 --> 00:19:50,069
Because of the spans

340
00:19:50,069 --> 00:19:52,069
between the vertical columns

341
00:19:52,069 --> 00:19:54,069
in the building we were shooting in,

342
00:19:54,069 --> 00:19:56,250
we wanted to tie into those to help support the floor.

343
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,420
And did a pretty good job

344
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,420
of hiding the beams,

345
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,420
especially you guys with all the curtains

346
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,420
you hung to hide the beams on set.

347
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,420
But they were baked in

348
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,420
and they were part of actually

349
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,920
holding the set together.

350
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,920
And here's one of your TVs behind the windows.

351
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,920
Yeah, TVs, and you can see the hose manifold

352
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,920
there of the hose coming in

353
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,920
to feed the sink

354
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,920
and the toilet feature.

355
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,920
Oh shit, Andy.

356
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,920
Yeah, we were super enthusiastic

357
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,920
about making sure that little detail

358
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,920
of actual running water was available on set.

359
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,920
Because we already knew we needed running water

360
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,920
for one of the toilet gags,

361
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,920
where the toilets broke in

362
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,920
as one of the potential story lines

363
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,920
we needed the toilet bill to spray water.

364
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,920
We're like, well, we're already going to run water here.

365
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,920
Why don't we just have the sinks be functional?

366
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,920
It actually ended up being useful

367
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,920
because we could use the running sinks on set

368
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,920
to clean between days.

369
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,099
I just had that

370
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:55,099
realistic touch, right?

371
00:20:55,099 --> 00:20:58,680
And this is the kind of stuff that you guys

372
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,049
would just do.

373
00:21:01,049 --> 00:21:03,049
It'd be like, oh, we can do running water.

374
00:21:03,049 --> 00:21:05,539
How? How can you do running water

375
00:21:05,539 --> 00:21:07,539
that makes no sense?

376
00:21:07,539 --> 00:21:09,980
It's pretty funny.

377
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,980
You can see in the, you go back,

378
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,980
it's actually all garden hoses and adapters.

379
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,539
See if you can see it.

380
00:21:16,539 --> 00:21:18,539
Yeah, so there's the manifold.

381
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:20,539
So that's actually all residential

382
00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:22,539
garden hose manifold stuff

383
00:21:22,539 --> 00:21:24,539
in two locations. One in the bathroom

384
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:26,539
and one near the, this is behind

385
00:21:26,539 --> 00:21:28,779
the kitchen area.

386
00:21:28,779 --> 00:21:30,779
And we like went

387
00:21:30,779 --> 00:21:32,779
to Menards and just found all

388
00:21:32,779 --> 00:21:34,779
of the little bits and doodads to go from

389
00:21:34,779 --> 00:21:36,779
garden hose to kitchen sink.

390
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:38,779
And I don't think you can see it here, but there's a little

391
00:21:38,779 --> 00:21:40,779
black hose to the bottom right

392
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:42,779
of those two yellow hoses running on the wall. That's actually

393
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:44,779
running into a five gallon bucket

394
00:21:44,779 --> 00:21:46,779
because drainage is its own

395
00:21:46,779 --> 00:21:48,779
level of difficulty. So we just had

396
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:50,779
five gallon buckets to

397
00:21:50,779 --> 00:21:52,779
drain the sinks to and we just emptied them whenever they

398
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:55,079
were needed.

399
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:57,079
See the oven in this clip too.

400
00:21:57,079 --> 00:21:59,079
I have a clip for the oven.

401
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:01,509
I think there was a time

402
00:22:01,509 --> 00:22:03,819
I was running the sink

403
00:22:03,819 --> 00:22:05,819
and I think there was a time where I got in my ear

404
00:22:05,819 --> 00:22:07,819
it was like, hey, hey, turn the sink

405
00:22:07,819 --> 00:22:09,819
off. You're going to fill the fucking bucket. It's going to overflow.

406
00:22:09,819 --> 00:22:11,819
Because I was using the sink too much

407
00:22:11,819 --> 00:22:13,819
one of the days. So somebody had to

408
00:22:13,819 --> 00:22:15,819
scramble back there and dump

409
00:22:15,819 --> 00:22:17,819
the bucket quick because he's going to flood it.

410
00:22:17,819 --> 00:22:21,140
This is

411
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,319
the handiwork here.

412
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:26,259
Was it you that worked on this?

413
00:22:26,259 --> 00:22:28,259
Me and a couple people who worked on

414
00:22:28,259 --> 00:22:30,259
the oven part. I did mostly the

415
00:22:30,259 --> 00:22:32,259
dressing of it whereas another

416
00:22:32,259 --> 00:22:34,259
AniMark person cut the back of it off

417
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:36,259
and that Brett really

418
00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:38,259
made the hole in the wall work with our contractor.

419
00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:40,259
So yeah, this is really

420
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:42,259
cool. This is so that behind the

421
00:22:42,259 --> 00:22:44,259
scenes we could have the cookie dough

422
00:22:44,259 --> 00:22:46,259
thing work where you put in the

423
00:22:46,259 --> 00:22:48,259
bowl of cookie

424
00:22:48,259 --> 00:22:50,259
dough and

425
00:22:50,259 --> 00:22:52,259
out comes a whole package of

426
00:22:52,259 --> 00:22:54,259
cookies without ever having to break camera on

427
00:22:54,259 --> 00:22:57,059
that room.

428
00:22:57,059 --> 00:22:59,059
Same with the mac and cheese, right?

429
00:22:59,059 --> 00:23:01,059
Yeah, mac and cheese was done the same way.

430
00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:03,059
I was the one

431
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:05,059
who was doing the oven management and I had to be

432
00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:07,059
super quiet because I knew the shotgun mics

433
00:23:07,059 --> 00:23:09,059
were on and right over the oven

434
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:11,059
so I'm super carefully pulling

435
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:13,059
it out of the oven trying not to make too much noise inside

436
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:15,059
that oven. I thought somebody was

437
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:17,059
pissing into that. I was like, oh, that's not

438
00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:19,059
what's that?

439
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:23,609
Yeah, that's something that

440
00:23:23,609 --> 00:23:25,609
Nick just mentioned there too. Every room had

441
00:23:25,609 --> 00:23:27,609
a microphone in it in addition to

442
00:23:27,609 --> 00:23:29,609
the ones that the characters were wearing

443
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:31,609
which is kind of a small

444
00:23:31,609 --> 00:23:33,609
thing but it makes a big difference in the end because that's

445
00:23:33,609 --> 00:23:35,609
how you were able to hear things like the moving crew

446
00:23:35,609 --> 00:23:37,609
who are not individually miced. They

447
00:23:37,609 --> 00:23:39,609
don't have microphones on because they don't have lines

448
00:23:39,609 --> 00:23:41,609
but that's how we would get some of that ambient noise of them

449
00:23:41,609 --> 00:23:43,609
running into things or kicking things or

450
00:23:43,609 --> 00:23:45,609
whatever or a scene with a lot of characters

451
00:23:45,609 --> 00:23:47,609
like in the party and what not. We can pick up little

452
00:23:47,609 --> 00:23:49,609
bits of conversation even though not every

453
00:23:49,609 --> 00:23:51,609
single person has a microphone. But it also

454
00:23:51,609 --> 00:23:53,609
the flip side right is that everybody working around that

455
00:23:53,609 --> 00:23:55,609
set or backstage has to be super careful

456
00:23:55,609 --> 00:23:57,609
because there's just like these

457
00:23:57,609 --> 00:23:59,609
ears that are just over every single room

458
00:23:59,609 --> 00:24:02,230
for everything you're doing. Yeah.

459
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:04,859
I see Jeremy laughing in the chat here.

460
00:24:04,859 --> 00:24:06,859
Yeah, because

461
00:24:06,859 --> 00:24:08,859
I've got my fucking gamer neck.

462
00:24:08,859 --> 00:24:10,859
It actually works.

463
00:24:10,859 --> 00:24:13,160
It does. So water's not on right now. This is the first

464
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,160
time that Jeremy saw the house. This is the first time that Jeremy

465
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,299
saw the house, yeah.

466
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:28,390
When we were sitting around,

467
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:31,140
what was going to happen? This is like what I

468
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,140
wanted but it was like, holy shit, this is no way

469
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,140
this is going to happen. Like there's no way this is ever

470
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,140
going to happen. This is unbelievable.

471
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,140
Like unfucking believable.

472
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,140
So this room gets added on

473
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,140
day two. So on day two, this becomes

474
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,140
the bedroom.

475
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,829
Mount Fiji?

476
00:24:47,829 --> 00:24:49,829
What is this? That's just like

477
00:24:49,829 --> 00:24:51,829
the built-in Alexa screen saver thing.

478
00:24:51,829 --> 00:24:53,829
We have custom

479
00:24:53,829 --> 00:24:55,829
like daytime, nighttime. Oh my

480
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:57,829
god. This shit was so cool. It really

481
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,829
was. There's three fake windows in the house and a TV.

482
00:24:59,829 --> 00:25:01,829
You know in those

483
00:25:01,829 --> 00:25:03,829
sim simulation games you play?

484
00:25:03,829 --> 00:25:06,009
Like when you see something for the first

485
00:25:06,009 --> 00:25:08,009
time, I was actually walking around like clapping

486
00:25:08,009 --> 00:25:10,009
at all this shit.

487
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:12,009
Like it was just, it was just

488
00:25:12,009 --> 00:25:17,940
insane. Is this a

489
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,940
I guess we could wait to talk about the

490
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,940
glass window. Oh yeah, going up

491
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:25,589
the stairs. And this is

492
00:25:25,589 --> 00:25:27,589
so much stuff. This is an

493
00:25:27,589 --> 00:25:29,589
insane amount of stuff by the way.

494
00:25:29,589 --> 00:25:31,589
You guys had so many options to

495
00:25:31,589 --> 00:25:33,589
buy things. Everything on that

496
00:25:33,589 --> 00:25:35,829
list, none of that was not there.

497
00:25:35,829 --> 00:25:37,829
How many items were back here were potential?

498
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:40,329
100? At least.

499
00:25:40,329 --> 00:25:42,329
We lost track. Yeah. 120,

500
00:25:42,329 --> 00:25:44,329
130 at least of the larger

501
00:25:44,329 --> 00:25:47,210
items. So every night

502
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:49,210
they counted the items to know where they were too.

503
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:51,210
So it was like they were constantly being checked to make sure that

504
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:53,210
the list of what was available.

505
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:55,210
They knew where every item was. They knew

506
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:57,210
how to get to it because that time is so fast once

507
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:59,210
they select. Nick and I went to

508
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:01,210
Goodwill one day

509
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:03,210
and we basically cleaned them out of furniture and they

510
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:05,210
said that it was the largest

511
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:07,210
order that they had ever had.

512
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:09,210
And then he and I went back

513
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:11,210
three more days after that

514
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:13,210
and just cleaned them out every single day. It was

515
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:15,210
like box trucks of Goodwill

516
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:17,210
stuff. Yeah, literal

517
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:19,210
box truck after box truck after box truck.

518
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:22,150
And the original idea was

519
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:24,150
potentially that we were just going to bring

520
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:26,970
it back, right? Like we might just

521
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:29,140
bring it all back. I don't know

522
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:33,049
what you guys are doing with that stuff.

523
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:35,049
It's still there.

524
00:26:35,049 --> 00:26:37,049
It's still figuring it out.

525
00:26:37,049 --> 00:26:39,049
Some of it was claimed by crew, but I

526
00:26:39,049 --> 00:26:41,049
assume that everything that's left over will just get

527
00:26:41,049 --> 00:26:43,049
donated again. I mean, some of it

528
00:26:43,049 --> 00:26:45,049
was pretty clean. Just donated again.

529
00:26:45,049 --> 00:26:47,220
I want to make this a point too.

530
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,220
Pretty much one of the things we wanted to make sure was

531
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,220
happening here was so a lot of

532
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,220
the stuff that we got from some of these

533
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,220
like thrift stores and stuff was to either

534
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:57,220
get it back there, donate it again,

535
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,220
donate it to where it belonged.

536
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,220
And a lot of this wood too. A lot

537
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,220
of this stuff is going to be reused and

538
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,220
repurposed from the construction manager.

539
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,220
It was all built to code.

540
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:09,980
It can be used to build houses.

541
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,980
A lot of this is actually going to get potentially repurposed.

542
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,980
So that's really good

543
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,980
because we essentially

544
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,980
put all this stuff here

545
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,980
and essentially built a half a house.

546
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,220
So I definitely wanted it

547
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,220
to go back as much as we could and kind of

548
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,519
repurpose and recycle it if we could.

549
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,519
I see chat asking about the stools.

550
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:30,519
So the stools,

551
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:32,519
there was one stool. It was just like

552
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:34,519
oh, we should probably have a foot stool as a thing that they could buy.

553
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:36,519
And chat loved

554
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:38,519
the stools and so that night

555
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:40,519
we sent somebody out and said buy as many stools

556
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:42,519
that model stool that you can find

557
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:44,519
and just cleaned them out. It was like

558
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:46,519
we went to every store in the area that sold

559
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:48,519
that sort of stool and just bought them out.

560
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:50,519
So we then just used them

561
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:52,519
whatever we could. We used them in the mystery boxes.

562
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:54,519
We put them back in the store.

563
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:56,519
They were in the cabinets upstairs.

564
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:58,519
The mystery cabinets or whatever they were called.

565
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:01,529
You get mystery boxes with

566
00:28:01,529 --> 00:28:03,529
just stools in them.

567
00:28:03,529 --> 00:28:08,059
This is case storage back here.

568
00:28:08,059 --> 00:28:10,059
Yeah, we had the delivery of all

569
00:28:10,059 --> 00:28:12,059
the stuff that, the technology that loaded

570
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:14,059
in here was the equivalent of a whole semi-truck

571
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:16,059
work. It was like

572
00:28:16,059 --> 00:28:18,059
several hours to unload, unload

573
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:20,059
and set it all up.

574
00:28:20,059 --> 00:28:22,059
That's the very back wall, yeah.

575
00:28:22,059 --> 00:28:24,059
I think we have a picture too of

576
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:26,059
kind of the layout plan for all the

577
00:28:26,059 --> 00:28:28,059
motors and everything. We had a lot of stuff

578
00:28:28,059 --> 00:28:30,059
suspended in the air to support all the lights

579
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:32,059
and... I got to clean up

580
00:28:32,059 --> 00:28:34,059
some stuff in there and then...

581
00:28:34,059 --> 00:28:36,059
This is back where everybody was hanging out. There was a monitor

582
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:38,059
here, back there. It was a screen.

583
00:28:38,059 --> 00:28:40,059
So all the actors,

584
00:28:40,059 --> 00:28:42,059
all the people that were kind of waiting on the

585
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:44,059
wings, they were all hanging out back here

586
00:28:44,059 --> 00:28:46,059
just watching the screen, just waiting for somebody to pump

587
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:48,059
in their ear or somebody to run back

588
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,059
here and be like, alright, we need to climb!

589
00:28:50,059 --> 00:28:52,059
And then just, they would get ready and come out.

590
00:28:52,059 --> 00:28:54,299
Yeah, I think I might

591
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:58,779
have a clip of that. It's called

592
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:01,660
Green Room Chillin'. There they are.

593
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,660
There's our actors back in that green room.

594
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,339
They're ready.

595
00:29:06,339 --> 00:29:08,339
Based on the

596
00:29:08,339 --> 00:29:10,339
chat decisions, we didn't know how fast

597
00:29:10,339 --> 00:29:12,339
it might be between bicycles or

598
00:29:12,339 --> 00:29:14,339
between different scenes and gags,

599
00:29:14,339 --> 00:29:16,339
right? So everybody kind of had to be armed

600
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:18,839
all the time. That couch is

601
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:20,839
so freaking comfortable by the way. You could fall

602
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:23,339
asleep on that couch. Just people in

603
00:29:23,339 --> 00:29:25,339
Marcy's just hanging out, like, what's up?

604
00:29:25,339 --> 00:29:27,339
You got used to that

605
00:29:27,339 --> 00:29:30,410
for a while. Everyone's just like

606
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:32,410
sitting there on their phone. Everyone's

607
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:35,160
watching, just waiting.

608
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,160
So here's some of the documents

609
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,160
that Alex was talking about.

610
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,980
Yeah, like in this case,

611
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,980
we had

612
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,980
16 points where in this building

613
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,980
we had to suspend things like truss

614
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,980
for lights or for cameras.

615
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,980
The camera shots you saw where you could place things

616
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,980
in a room or when you see them flashing

617
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,980
and you're picking a room, all of those shots are cameras

618
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,980
that had to be suspended so that we could cut between

619
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,980
them without getting crew in them and worrying about

620
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,980
where the wireless operators were walking.

621
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,980
So we had 16 points where we

622
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,980
hung things, or curtains, right? Like

623
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,980
we had that whole upper floor curtain with

624
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,980
heavy drapes that you couldn't see that it was

625
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,980
there so it would be a surprise for the last day. So

626
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,980
this kind of, we make these

627
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,980
different drawings that lay out where things go so that

628
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,980
as local crew comes in or hired

629
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,980
crew and whatnot, they all kind of have the same thing to

630
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,980
work off of. And we kind of

631
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,980
write all of our changes on them as we go. There's

632
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,980
lights and video and each one kind of has their

633
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,980
own to keep track of.

634
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,980
I think we have a video too of the

635
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,980
lighting. When we design the lighting for

636
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,980
something like this, it all gets put into a

637
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,980
simulation program

638
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,980
where it actually shows all the different

639
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,980
types of lights that are going to be available

640
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:42,599
and a little recording

641
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:45,029
kind of shows it. But you can kind of see

642
00:30:45,029 --> 00:30:47,029
this is the party sequences designed in

643
00:30:47,029 --> 00:30:49,029
this simulator program.

644
00:30:49,029 --> 00:30:51,029
So we can actually, you can see kind of the rough layout of how

645
00:30:51,029 --> 00:30:53,029
the rooms are. It's somewhat representative

646
00:30:53,029 --> 00:30:55,029
and the lights are laid out where they would be

647
00:30:55,029 --> 00:30:57,029
on the different points that are hanging in the air.

648
00:30:57,029 --> 00:30:59,029
And so then we can design

649
00:30:59,029 --> 00:31:01,029
these sequences and get an idea of what they look like.

650
00:31:01,029 --> 00:31:03,029
You can see a human analog in one of the rooms as well

651
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:05,029
and kind of see what

652
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:07,029
we'd be working with and know where to lay

653
00:31:07,029 --> 00:31:09,029
things out before you're on site. Because once you're on site

654
00:31:09,029 --> 00:31:11,029
and you put something in place, it's a lot

655
00:31:11,029 --> 00:31:13,400
harder to move it. So we try to simulate a lot

656
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,220
of that as best we can.

657
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,220
I mentioned this to you guys on the

658
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,220
actual set, but I'll say it to you guys here.

659
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,220
When this idea was just kind of floating

660
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,710
around like years ago just for fun,

661
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:26,890
you know when you close your eyes and you

662
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:28,890
see, like you see the

663
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:30,890
thing that you, let's say you're working

664
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:32,890
on a project or you're writing something or

665
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:34,890
you're making content or whatever,

666
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:36,890
when you close your eyes and you see this movie

667
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:39,059
in your head, right? I

668
00:31:39,059 --> 00:31:41,240
saw this set is

669
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,420
what I saw. And it's crazy to actually

670
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,720
see it happen. Your imagination,

671
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,720
your actual visual of exactly what

672
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,859
you see in your head, it's bizarre

673
00:31:50,859 --> 00:31:52,859
to see it actually play out.

674
00:31:52,859 --> 00:31:54,859
When I play, the people are doing the

675
00:31:54,859 --> 00:31:56,859
question marks to me. You guys don't play movies in your head?

676
00:31:56,859 --> 00:32:00,680
Who doesn't do that? You can't

677
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,680
just see a movie right now, play it right

678
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:06,390
now? Am I insane? What's happening?

679
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:08,569
They're saying you hallucinate.

680
00:32:08,569 --> 00:32:10,569
It's not hallucinating.

681
00:32:10,569 --> 00:32:13,059
I'm imagining the set.

682
00:32:13,059 --> 00:32:15,059
Hallucination?

683
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:20,250
It's a vision.

684
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:22,250
So when I close my eyes

685
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:24,250
and I saw this set, this

686
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:26,250
is like what they built is what I was seeing.

687
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:28,250
And that's incredibly rare.

688
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:31,960
That never happens. Where is this?

689
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,960
This is at the airport.

690
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,960
Oh, it's at like the airport. I was like where the fuck

691
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,960
are we? The airlines

692
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,960
aren't very happy with the amount of stuff we move.

693
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,960
Yeah, we'll move 20 or 30 road cases

694
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,960
at a time just like through

695
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,329
the luggage system. Sometimes

696
00:32:46,329 --> 00:32:48,329
it'll show up on a second plane because they couldn't get it

697
00:32:48,329 --> 00:32:50,819
to hit weight on the first plane.

698
00:32:50,819 --> 00:32:53,579
But part of the deal is that works.

699
00:32:53,579 --> 00:32:55,579
This is the rest of the set. Yeah, imagine.

700
00:32:55,579 --> 00:32:59,670
You have the render

701
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:01,670
from the day one, two, three

702
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:04,920
color render.

703
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,920
I see if chat noticed one thing about the

704
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,740
day one render. Oh, yeah.

705
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:14,089
Mm hmm.

706
00:33:14,089 --> 00:33:16,839
The horse in it. The horse is not

707
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:18,839
in day one. No, but this one. Yeah.

708
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:21,269
Somebody said chat can't rotate

709
00:33:21,269 --> 00:33:23,269
a cube in their head.

710
00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:25,269
I was going to point out too

711
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:27,579
in these renderings

712
00:33:27,579 --> 00:33:29,579
a couple things here that are interesting.

713
00:33:29,579 --> 00:33:31,579
So the giant TVs are there.

714
00:33:31,579 --> 00:33:33,579
They were placed in a specific spot so that

715
00:33:33,579 --> 00:33:35,579
no matter where the characters are moving in the house

716
00:33:35,579 --> 00:33:37,579
they could always see chat. So those

717
00:33:37,579 --> 00:33:39,579
giant monitors, one of them was chat and the other

718
00:33:39,579 --> 00:33:41,579
one was what was going out on the feed. So they could always

719
00:33:41,579 --> 00:33:43,579
see no matter which character and where they were.

720
00:33:43,579 --> 00:33:45,579
There was always a view from each room.

721
00:33:45,579 --> 00:33:47,579
But the other thing here that's kind of interesting is

722
00:33:47,579 --> 00:33:49,579
this was supposed to be the model for

723
00:33:49,579 --> 00:33:51,579
day one with just the middle rooms.

724
00:33:51,579 --> 00:33:53,579
And the yard actually wasn't part of it.

725
00:33:53,579 --> 00:33:55,579
And that was added later. That was an on-site change

726
00:33:55,579 --> 00:33:57,579
kind of based on the logistics of

727
00:33:57,579 --> 00:33:59,579
how would things get into the

728
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,579
house and what were we interacting with. So

729
00:34:01,579 --> 00:34:03,579
that's like an example of something that

730
00:34:03,579 --> 00:34:05,579
those kind of things just happen on. It doesn't matter how much

731
00:34:05,579 --> 00:34:07,579
you plan in advance. We needed that logistically

732
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:09,579
so these pieces moved around

733
00:34:09,579 --> 00:34:11,579
and we had the yard accessible in the first day.

734
00:34:11,579 --> 00:34:13,940
I think that was the night before change.

735
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,940
I think those curtains were already up there

736
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,940
or being tied on at the point that it was like

737
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:21,659
nope, we want the yard visible.

738
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:23,659
There was a visual with seeing

739
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:25,659
that side view with the

740
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:27,659
cutaway view. And we sat there

741
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:30,280
we were just staring at it like, if I'm coming in

742
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,280
through the left side of the door

743
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,650
we can't

744
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:36,650
just have it be, oh look it's just outside

745
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:38,650
and I just appear in the door

746
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:41,019
into the kitchen, into the living room.

747
00:34:41,019 --> 00:34:43,019
So it's good that we actually had a solution to it.

748
00:34:43,019 --> 00:34:46,019
I guess one

749
00:34:46,019 --> 00:34:48,019
last little pre-production thing

750
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:50,019
that we'll talk about before we move into the next segment

751
00:34:50,019 --> 00:34:52,260
are these

752
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,440
Gobos that we had made. These are kind of cool.

753
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,440
They're a little hard to see. You may not have seen them on

754
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,440
the stream but you can see them here. We took

755
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,440
nice photos of them. These are

756
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,440
metal disks that are

757
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,440
hunched and laser cut basically

758
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,440
to show an image. In this case we have the

759
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,440
germ and the logo

760
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,440
here. You can actually see a good amount of detail on it.

761
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,440
And then those moving lights that we have we could position them

762
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,440
to color and

763
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,440
location and all that so we could actually light

764
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,440
Coinbase with their blue and Twitch with their

765
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,440
purple and then Jeremy's logo

766
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,440
with the green and blue. And so at various

767
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,440
points, we didn't show the corner camera

768
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,440
a lot because of the context of the rooms

769
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,440
we were showing but there was a few occasions

770
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,440
or like the monologue when

771
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,440
Jeremy talks about Coinbase and what not where you could kind of

772
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,440
see their logo and their color and

773
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,440
it adds a lot of character to

774
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,320
the house and what you're seeing too. That was awesome.

775
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,969
Nick, is there anything else you want to talk about

776
00:35:42,969 --> 00:35:44,969
in pre-production before we

777
00:35:44,969 --> 00:35:46,969
move on? Maybe the glass

778
00:35:46,969 --> 00:35:48,969
a little bit. That would be about it for the window.

779
00:35:48,969 --> 00:35:51,210
Oh yeah. If you want

780
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:53,210
to talk about that. Sure.

781
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:55,210
That's like one of my favorite gags

782
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:57,639
the whole week. Let me

783
00:35:57,639 --> 00:35:59,639
cue up a video here. So

784
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:01,639
those of you who watch the stream,

785
00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:08,099
Jeremy going out the glass

786
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:10,099
is real 100%

787
00:36:10,099 --> 00:36:12,099
and we're going to show you some footage.

788
00:36:12,099 --> 00:36:14,099
We got proof. We have real proof

789
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:16,099
that it's really real. Not a stunt double

790
00:36:16,099 --> 00:36:18,099
not pre-recorded. That happened

791
00:36:18,099 --> 00:36:20,280
live. Absolutely live.

792
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,280
So first I'm going to show you

793
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,280
we had a sheet of the glass

794
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,280
show up broken

795
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,280
to our set and so we had a piece

796
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,519
to test with because we had this broken piece

797
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:32,889
and so here's a

798
00:36:32,889 --> 00:36:34,889
short clip of Nick testing

799
00:36:34,889 --> 00:36:36,889
what it's like to punch through this glass. By the way

800
00:36:36,889 --> 00:36:38,889
at least, Nick,

801
00:36:38,889 --> 00:36:40,889
I think you were terrified to do this because none of us

802
00:36:40,889 --> 00:36:42,889
had interacted with the glass at this point.

803
00:36:42,889 --> 00:36:44,889
I had no idea.

804
00:36:44,889 --> 00:36:46,889
This is not real glass. Don't do this at home.

805
00:36:46,889 --> 00:36:48,889
It's not real glass. Don't punch a glass.

806
00:36:48,889 --> 00:36:51,059
This is Hollywood glass made

807
00:36:51,059 --> 00:36:53,059
by a studio in Culver City

808
00:36:53,059 --> 00:36:55,059
that this is all that they do

809
00:36:55,059 --> 00:36:57,059
they're the only manufacturer of this glass

810
00:36:57,059 --> 00:36:59,059
for television. It's very expensive.

811
00:36:59,059 --> 00:37:01,940
Don't do this at home.

812
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,940
I was not certain how it was going to go

813
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:07,849
but it explodes

814
00:37:07,849 --> 00:37:09,849
with any real

815
00:37:09,849 --> 00:37:11,849
energy put into it. You can break

816
00:37:11,849 --> 00:37:13,849
it and it breaks into large pieces

817
00:37:13,849 --> 00:37:15,849
but with any real energy it

818
00:37:15,849 --> 00:37:17,849
just explodes out but it explodes

819
00:37:17,849 --> 00:37:19,849
safely. All the edges are pretty dull.

820
00:37:19,849 --> 00:37:21,849
The worst thing that happens is you get a

821
00:37:21,849 --> 00:37:23,849
little bit of dust

822
00:37:23,849 --> 00:37:25,849
on your fingers that looks kind of like glitter

823
00:37:25,849 --> 00:37:27,849
but before I punched that I did not

824
00:37:27,849 --> 00:37:29,849
know how it was going to break.

825
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:34,019
Which was kind of worrisome but we had info

826
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:36,019
we could actually tell Jeremy like yep, it's safe, it's good.

827
00:37:39,099 --> 00:37:41,099
The fact that

828
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:43,099
the gloves were picked on

829
00:37:43,099 --> 00:37:45,340
the second day. I remember sitting there thinking

830
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:47,340
I put on like big rubber.

831
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,340
Yeah, like you guys didn't even know but you

832
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,340
like protected my hands which was like

833
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,340
important, right? Hands, forearms,

834
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,340
wrists, that whole thing.

835
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:59,510
I was going to say before we show the clip I have some clips

836
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,510
of Jeremy practicing.

837
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:03,510
This is the very first time that

838
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:05,510
he practiced. There's no glass in the window. This is just

839
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:10,119
him flying through the window.

840
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:24,760
Yeah, let's do it.

841
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,760
There's only one rule, don't jump too far.

842
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,760
Foreshadowing, yeah.

843
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,760
So it actually isn't super fancy.

844
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,760
You can see some of the construction here.

845
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,760
There's actually just some scrap trim pieces

846
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,760
that is used with like some spacer trim

847
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,760
to hold the glass.

848
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,760
The big thing about this is when

849
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,760
we thought about logistics of the show we

850
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,760
didn't want the glass to be broken

851
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,760
before he gets to it, right?

852
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,760
But we also knew that it

853
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,760
takes a period of time to

854
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,760
install this glass and we didn't want it to be

855
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,760
like held in with brackets or anything that would be disturbing

856
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,760
so it just, like the two pieces

857
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,760
slotted in in those wood pieces of trim.

858
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,760
You can actually see a great view here

859
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,760
of kind of the different glass things

860
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,940
but we knew we only

861
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,940
had, we knew it took about 20 minutes to install

862
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,940
it and we didn't want to interrupt the stream whatsoever

863
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:13,110
so it had to survive the whole stream.

864
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:15,110
So like the whole time I'm like, is it going to survive?

865
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:17,110
And I was like, nobody can touch this wall,

866
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:19,110
nobody can slam that door while the glass is in.

867
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:21,349
I was kind of a

868
00:39:21,349 --> 00:39:23,530
jerk about it because like it would be kind of

869
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:25,530
catastrophic to have a piece of glass

870
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,699
like fall out before

871
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:29,699
it was supposed to, right?

872
00:39:29,699 --> 00:39:31,699
That was the gag of the second day

873
00:39:31,699 --> 00:39:33,699
so if it was, if we went into that room and the

874
00:39:33,699 --> 00:39:35,699
window was already broken it'd be like, oh well

875
00:39:35,699 --> 00:39:37,699
I guess I'm getting thrown out anyways.

876
00:39:37,699 --> 00:39:39,699
Every time someone went in this room

877
00:39:39,699 --> 00:39:41,699
the radio call was like, careful with the door, careful

878
00:39:41,699 --> 00:39:43,699
with the door. Don't touch it, be

879
00:39:43,699 --> 00:39:46,460
careful, be slow. So we

880
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,460
did a lot to make sure

881
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:50,460
that this was safe so obviously the

882
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,460
glass itself that breaks into

883
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,460
pieces but all of the trim

884
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:56,460
is actually painted balsa wood

885
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,460
so that when his face inevitably goes

886
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,460
through one of them it just breaks

887
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,460
into like his dust, right? It's not like an actual

888
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,460
piece of lumber that would harm

889
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,460
him as he goes through it.

890
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:08,460
The top panel is actually not

891
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:10,460
this Hollywood

892
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:12,460
glass, it's a piece of very very thin

893
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:14,460
polycarbonate that would flex and

894
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,460
like blow out if he

895
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,460
ended up, you know, if Jeremy jumped

896
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,460
too high and ended up going through that top

897
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,460
piece it would just leave. But incredibly

898
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,630
he didn't. He completely

899
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,630
cleared, he completely cleared

900
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:28,630
the second, like his body, the entirety

901
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:30,809
of his body goes between

902
00:40:30,809 --> 00:40:32,809
yeah, yeah, we'll see, we'll see in a second. Alright.

903
00:40:32,809 --> 00:40:34,809
Let's play the clip.

904
00:40:34,809 --> 00:40:37,239
You're dealing with a professional.

905
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:43,769
Sorry, I thought I had it. So, well I guess first

906
00:40:43,769 --> 00:40:45,769
we'll show the front ways

907
00:40:45,769 --> 00:40:47,769
how you saw it at home.

908
00:40:47,769 --> 00:40:50,500
Right?

909
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,500
So this guy is in this room.

910
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,500
He is huge.

911
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,500
He's like Jerry in real life.

912
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,869
Yeah, he's an artist. I'll play

913
00:40:58,869 --> 00:41:00,869
back one more time.

914
00:41:00,869 --> 00:41:02,869
He was a

915
00:41:02,869 --> 00:41:04,869
big guy.

916
00:41:04,869 --> 00:41:06,869
Notice the fire in the window.

917
00:41:06,869 --> 00:41:10,260
The fire in the window is

918
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:13,139
such a great touch.

919
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:15,139
You hit that perfectly, like super perfectly.

920
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,139
Now here's the proof.

921
00:41:17,139 --> 00:41:19,139
This is it right here. I

922
00:41:19,139 --> 00:41:21,139
took this footage because we started the scene

923
00:41:21,139 --> 00:41:23,139
and I realized that nobody was back there and I was like

924
00:41:23,139 --> 00:41:25,139
we have to have this, so here we go.

925
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:42,949
Brutal.

926
00:41:42,949 --> 00:41:44,949
You can hear me say, you good? And he

927
00:41:44,949 --> 00:41:46,949
gives me the thumbs up.

928
00:41:46,949 --> 00:41:48,949
Let me see if I can

929
00:41:48,949 --> 00:41:50,949
play the end of it again one more time.

930
00:41:50,949 --> 00:41:52,949
Remember the rule was don't overshoot the mattress.

931
00:41:52,949 --> 00:41:55,130
It makes such a great sound

932
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:57,130
to, that's not like sound effects

933
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:59,130
either. That's not foley. Oh wow, what a great sound effect.

934
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:04,360
Right there.

935
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,360
I did have, I did get

936
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,360
like a few small abrasions

937
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,360
here and like maybe like here and here

938
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,599
like down like on the forearm, but nothing.

939
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:14,780
Nothing that would, you know,

940
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,949
that wasn't bleeding or anything, I was fine.

941
00:42:16,949 --> 00:42:20,599
Scraped, a little scraped.

942
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:22,599
It was unbelievable. I remember

943
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:24,599
when you showed that to me, you were like hey

944
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:26,599
what do you think about like this concept and like

945
00:42:26,599 --> 00:42:28,599
I was going to put the ball so and I'm just like

946
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:30,599
I think I just started clapping.

947
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:33,739
I was like this is the greatest thing ever.

948
00:42:33,739 --> 00:42:35,739
It was perfect. I don't think chat

949
00:42:35,739 --> 00:42:37,739
knows what they started with. Well, so this is

950
00:42:37,739 --> 00:42:39,739
he can't tie his own shoes because he's wearing the gloves

951
00:42:39,739 --> 00:42:41,739
but if you go to this one too, on the day

952
00:42:41,739 --> 00:42:43,739
that I demanded it, on the day that

953
00:42:43,739 --> 00:42:45,739
chat chose the cargo

954
00:42:45,739 --> 00:42:48,039
shorts.

955
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:50,039
Jeremy, you want to talk about the cargo shorts?

956
00:42:50,039 --> 00:42:52,039
Yeah, the cargo shorts. I don't think people realize what they

957
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:54,219
did by picking cargo shorts.

958
00:42:54,219 --> 00:42:56,519
Yes, so here's the deal.

959
00:42:56,519 --> 00:42:58,519
So those are not the

960
00:42:58,519 --> 00:43:00,519
cargo shorts that you guys actually

961
00:43:00,519 --> 00:43:02,699
picked. There was cargo pants and

962
00:43:02,699 --> 00:43:04,699
cargo shorts. Now the problem was

963
00:43:04,699 --> 00:43:07,059
the cargo shorts

964
00:43:07,059 --> 00:43:09,059
were like a size 28 waist

965
00:43:09,059 --> 00:43:11,059
and I could not fit in them. It was

966
00:43:11,059 --> 00:43:13,059
inappropriate, like actually inappropriate.

967
00:43:13,059 --> 00:43:15,300
It was not cool.

968
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,300
So the hope was that

969
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,300
there's no way you guys are going to pick cargo shorts

970
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:21,300
because that's like boring. You're going to pick the flamingo.

971
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,300
You're going to pick the duckies.

972
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,300
It was a boring choice that you were never

973
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,539
going to pick, right? But when you

974
00:43:27,539 --> 00:43:29,539
picked it, it was like what do we do? Because I

975
00:43:29,539 --> 00:43:31,719
can't stream like this. This is

976
00:43:31,719 --> 00:43:33,900
actually not okay. It was like

977
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,900
skin-air tight

978
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:37,900
to my body.

979
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:40,260
And we had to,

980
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:42,260
right when I was told, somebody ran backstage

981
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:44,260
and was like, hey, it's the cargo shorts.

982
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:46,570
We're just like, shit. Get the

983
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:48,570
cargo pants in. Cut the cargo

984
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:50,570
pants into shorts. Because I'm not

985
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:52,570
wearing those for like four or five hours. No

986
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:54,869
way. So if you look at

987
00:43:54,869 --> 00:43:56,869
the bottom of the shorts, they're like all

988
00:43:56,869 --> 00:43:58,869
frayed up and like very

989
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:00,869
clearly cut with a pair of scissors.

990
00:44:00,869 --> 00:44:02,869
Almost inappropriate.

991
00:44:02,869 --> 00:44:04,869
Almost like TOS inappropriate.

992
00:44:04,869 --> 00:44:07,050
I'm glad we avoided that.

993
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:09,050
Yeah, so I run backstage. I have a

994
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:11,050
belt pack that I would put on that has his ears

995
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:13,050
so he can hear us talking and it has

996
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:15,050
the microphone that he was using. And

997
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:17,050
what I see is two production assistants

998
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:19,050
on the ground with scissors just going

999
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:21,050
crazy on the cargo pants trying to turn

1000
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:23,349
them into shorts. We might actually

1001
00:44:23,349 --> 00:44:25,349
have a picture of that. I think somebody took a picture

1002
00:44:25,349 --> 00:44:27,349
of the two next to each other for like fun.

1003
00:44:27,349 --> 00:44:29,349
I'll see if I can find that over the break.

1004
00:44:29,349 --> 00:44:31,349
So at this point we're going to take

1005
00:44:31,349 --> 00:44:33,349
a quick break.

1006
00:44:33,349 --> 00:44:35,349
Sorry, Chad.

1007
00:44:35,349 --> 00:44:37,349
It's going to be an ad break. And we could

1008
00:44:37,349 --> 00:44:39,349
talk a little bit about ads and sponsors

1009
00:44:39,349 --> 00:44:41,349
a little bit later because

1010
00:44:41,349 --> 00:44:43,349
they were the only reason that we could do this show.

1011
00:44:43,349 --> 00:44:45,349
But we're going to go to ad break

1012
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,349
and when we come back, we're going to talk production

1013
00:44:47,349 --> 00:44:49,349
with

1014
00:44:49,349 --> 00:44:51,349
our video director Bobby,

1015
00:44:51,349 --> 00:44:53,349
with Criken, our game director,

1016
00:44:53,349 --> 00:44:55,349
and with everybody's fan favorite

1017
00:44:55,349 --> 00:44:57,349
Art Mark. Art Mark

1018
00:44:57,349 --> 00:44:59,349
is joining us tonight. So

1019
00:44:59,349 --> 00:45:01,349
look forward to that.

1020
00:45:01,349 --> 00:45:03,530
But yeah, we'll see you

1021
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:05,530
in just a few minutes after these

1022
00:45:05,530 --> 00:48:23,349
short messages. Thanks, Chad.

1023
00:48:23,349 --> 00:48:25,349
So our company Ghost Commander's

1024
00:48:25,349 --> 00:48:27,349
role on this production was not only

1025
00:48:27,349 --> 00:48:29,349
building and designing the

1026
00:48:29,349 --> 00:48:31,349
extension itself and the different interactive

1027
00:48:31,349 --> 00:48:33,349
modes like buy mode and placement

1028
00:48:33,349 --> 00:48:35,530
mode and the

1029
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:37,530
different poles of live mode that played out

1030
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:39,769
throughout the stream. But

1031
00:48:39,769 --> 00:48:41,769
we also ran the thing live. So

1032
00:48:41,769 --> 00:48:43,769
on set, we would basically

1033
00:48:43,769 --> 00:48:45,769
push each pole via

1034
00:48:45,769 --> 00:48:47,769
our computers to everyone

1035
00:48:47,769 --> 00:48:49,769
watching. We compile the results

1036
00:48:49,769 --> 00:48:51,769
and then display the results

1037
00:48:51,769 --> 00:48:53,769
as well and then relay

1038
00:48:53,769 --> 00:48:55,769
what won and what should happen at what time

1039
00:48:55,769 --> 00:48:57,769
to the rest of the crew. So things

1040
00:48:57,769 --> 00:48:59,769
like, you know, how

1041
00:48:59,769 --> 00:49:01,769
Jerma should react in a given situation.

1042
00:49:01,769 --> 00:49:03,769
We would then turn into different

1043
00:49:03,769 --> 00:49:05,769
pole events and different options.

1044
00:49:05,769 --> 00:49:07,769
Some of those we build on the fly based on

1045
00:49:07,769 --> 00:49:09,769
what viewers liked and wanted. And then we push

1046
00:49:09,769 --> 00:49:11,769
that out to everyone and then, you know, gather

1047
00:49:11,769 --> 00:49:13,769
the 30,000 replies and then

1048
00:49:13,769 --> 00:49:15,769
relay to

1049
00:49:15,769 --> 00:49:17,769
the rest of the team what needs to happen

1050
00:49:17,769 --> 00:49:19,769
on stage. Wait, a professional

1051
00:49:19,769 --> 00:49:21,769
fartographer? Yes.

1052
00:49:21,769 --> 00:49:23,769
I am operating all the microphones

1053
00:49:23,769 --> 00:49:25,769
so any audio you hear on stream comes from

1054
00:49:25,769 --> 00:49:28,329
this console and this laptop.

1055
00:49:28,329 --> 00:49:30,329
Wireless microphones are

1056
00:49:30,329 --> 00:49:32,329
all set for all the actors and I have

1057
00:49:32,329 --> 00:49:34,329
this wonderful soundboard with

1058
00:49:34,329 --> 00:49:36,329
a variety of fart selections

1059
00:49:36,329 --> 00:49:38,329
to fit the scenario. So I can do

1060
00:49:38,329 --> 00:49:40,329
one of those, I can do

1061
00:49:40,329 --> 00:49:42,329
one of those. If I want something a little wetter

1062
00:49:42,329 --> 00:49:44,329
I can kind of go in

1063
00:49:44,329 --> 00:49:46,329
that direction.

1064
00:49:46,329 --> 00:49:48,329
So I am making the sound magic out of here.

1065
00:49:57,539 --> 00:49:59,980
Take seven.

1066
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:01,980
I'm going to get into the devil and start saying that

1067
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:03,980
because I don't want to have to fart.

1068
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:05,980
So this is our video production trailer

1069
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:07,980
so we're taking all the camera feeds

1070
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:09,980
into this trailer and

1071
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:11,980
distributing them out throughout the

1072
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:13,980
entire set. We're feeding

1073
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:15,980
different TVs, monitors, the live stream.

1074
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:17,980
We've got some graphics computers

1075
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:19,980
doing a bunch of stuff

1076
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:21,980
to create this awesome game and

1077
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:23,980
this is where all the video stuff happens.

1078
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:25,980
Nine, you're working right now.

1079
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:27,980
Can you push it slower to his face?

1080
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:30,599
I don't want to be caught, I don't want to be free.

1081
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:32,599
I don't want to be caught, I don't want to be free.

1082
00:50:32,599 --> 00:50:34,599
Keep pushing, keep pushing. Ready, ten. Take ten.

1083
00:50:34,599 --> 00:50:36,599
Ready, nine again. Tight as you can on his face.

1084
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:38,599
Ready, nine.

1085
00:50:38,599 --> 00:50:40,599
Ready, ten. Take ten.

1086
00:50:40,599 --> 00:50:42,599
Ready, three. Take three.

1087
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:49,699
Alright. I think that's a great intro

1088
00:50:49,699 --> 00:50:51,699
for our next guests.

1089
00:50:51,699 --> 00:50:55,420
How are we?

1090
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:58,860
Hi.

1091
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:00,860
Is this working?

1092
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:02,860
Yeah, it's working. We can hear you cracking.

1093
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:05,219
Cool, cool. Hi everybody.

1094
00:51:05,219 --> 00:51:08,039
Bobby, how's it going?

1095
00:51:08,039 --> 00:51:10,340
How we doing?

1096
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:12,340
Wait, Bobby, are you still on set?

1097
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:14,340
He's still there.

1098
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:16,340
What the hell?

1099
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:18,340
Let him leave, Jake.

1100
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:22,340
He's been there so long.

1101
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:24,340
Yeah, what the?

1102
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:26,340
He's like slowly pulling up the mic to talk.

1103
00:51:29,349 --> 00:51:31,349
And we got Mark. Fart Mark.

1104
00:51:31,349 --> 00:51:34,679
Yes, I don't have any farts queued up right now

1105
00:51:34,679 --> 00:51:36,679
but I can work on that.

1106
00:51:36,679 --> 00:51:38,679
What an opportunity.

1107
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:40,679
Where's the emoji instead?

1108
00:51:40,679 --> 00:51:42,679
We got natural fart.

1109
00:51:42,679 --> 00:51:44,679
Yeah, I got the emoji. This is something Bobby insisted

1110
00:51:44,679 --> 00:51:46,679
I leave set with.

1111
00:51:46,679 --> 00:51:48,679
We tried to hide this in his trailer

1112
00:51:48,679 --> 00:51:50,679
but he found it before he pulled out.

1113
00:51:50,679 --> 00:51:53,619
So he was like, no, this is going to the park.

1114
00:51:53,619 --> 00:51:55,619
And thank you immensely for that.

1115
00:51:55,619 --> 00:51:59,530
Well deserved, well deserved.

1116
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:01,699
So where do you want to start?

1117
00:52:01,699 --> 00:52:03,699
Well, why don't we talk

1118
00:52:03,699 --> 00:52:05,940
a little bit about

1119
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:07,940
let's start with you and talk about

1120
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:09,940
Ghost Commander and the extension.

1121
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:11,940
I have some clips

1122
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:13,940
of us kind of ruminating

1123
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:15,940
on that stuff a few months ago

1124
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:17,940
and did the onsite in Indiana if you want to hear some of that

1125
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:19,940
or if you just want to give an intro and then we can

1126
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:21,940
play some of that.

1127
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:23,940
Yeah, I'll start with that.

1128
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,940
So we, I'm Kraken.

1129
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:27,940
I'm a streamer. I've been doing so for like

1130
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:29,940
a decade now.

1131
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:31,940
And started out

1132
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:33,940
doing the usual streaming stuff

1133
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:35,940
and then decided over the last three years that I wanted to make

1134
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:37,940
interactive streams

1135
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:39,940
more possible. Not only for

1136
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:41,940
my own content but for other

1137
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:44,440
content creators that I respect.

1138
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:46,440
So I started a company with my co-founder

1139
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,440
Lauren, who is pictured in

1140
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,440
a lot of these as well, behind the

1141
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:52,440
computers with me.

1142
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,440
And we basically built a production

1143
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:56,440
company that builds interactive livestream

1144
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,440
experiences and the tools that can run them.

1145
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,440
And so I remember talking

1146
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:02,440
with Jeremy back at TwitchCon

1147
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,440
whenever that last one happened

1148
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,679
in San Diego.

1149
00:53:06,679 --> 00:53:08,679
2017, 2016 maybe?

1150
00:53:08,679 --> 00:53:10,679
It feels like, yeah,

1151
00:53:10,679 --> 00:53:12,920
we talked about

1152
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:14,920
the concept of a show like this

1153
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:16,920
and we both got really excited about it.

1154
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:18,920
And back then it was kind of like, you know, oh, it would be nice

1155
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,920
but we need a lot of money and a lot of

1156
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:23,480
other people to make it work.

1157
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:25,480
And then fast forward, you know, however

1158
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:27,480
many years and

1159
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,480
you guys bring me back up and you're like,

1160
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:31,480
well, we have the money.

1161
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,480
We have the opportunity.

1162
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,480
Would you guys like to build an interactive show with us?

1163
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,719
And I was like,

1164
00:53:37,719 --> 00:53:40,019
you know what? Why not?

1165
00:53:40,019 --> 00:53:42,019
And so we flew out all the way to Indiana

1166
00:53:42,019 --> 00:53:44,019
to see you guys without

1167
00:53:44,019 --> 00:53:46,019
signing anything yet. We're just like,

1168
00:53:46,019 --> 00:53:48,019
we're going to trust it's going to work out.

1169
00:53:48,019 --> 00:53:50,019
No documents.

1170
00:53:50,019 --> 00:53:52,019
No signatures. Just get there.

1171
00:53:52,019 --> 00:53:54,460
And that's what happened to me.

1172
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:58,170
The live thing, the live

1173
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:01,670
anything that's happening, that's any of these

1174
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:03,670
options, you know, it's like the

1175
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:05,670
so we talked about potentially

1176
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:07,670
people being able to click on stuff or being able to like

1177
00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:09,670
where I'm

1178
00:54:09,670 --> 00:54:11,670
thinking is

1179
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:13,670
because we can either have them click on

1180
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:15,670
actual objects and be like,

1181
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:17,670
do this. Or

1182
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:19,670
we can have like a

1183
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:21,670
drop down menu of all the things that are available.

1184
00:54:21,670 --> 00:54:23,670
You know what I mean? Like, oh, actions

1185
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:25,670
that are available, right? Let's say you have

1186
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:27,670
getting behind the scenes.

1187
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:29,670
He's getting behind the scenes. Perfect.

1188
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:31,670
What do you mean?

1189
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:33,670
Oh, right, right, right.

1190
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:35,670
So what I think

1191
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:37,670
this is, I mean, this is okay.

1192
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:39,670
But I would probably

1193
00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:41,670
consider redoing the whole thing.

1194
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:43,670
It's not funny.

1195
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:45,670
Oh, yeah, we had the bit going

1196
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:47,670
where you're just going to be

1197
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:49,670
awful.

1198
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:51,670
Yeah, I forgot.

1199
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:53,670
I completely forgot. We were going to do a routine

1200
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:55,670
where, no, that didn't make this at all.

1201
00:54:55,670 --> 00:54:57,670
I'm realizing, I'm being a dick

1202
00:54:57,670 --> 00:54:59,670
here. We

1203
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:01,670
were going to have the behind the scenes show be me

1204
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:03,670
being an asshole to everybody for an entire

1205
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:05,670
like three months. I

1206
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:07,670
didn't even use it. This is the only footage

1207
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:09,670
we took of me doing that. I was watching

1208
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:11,670
your face as you're watching this right now going, why

1209
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:13,670
the fuck? What? That's me?

1210
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:15,670
What's wrong with me?

1211
00:55:18,099 --> 00:55:21,239
That's so funny.

1212
00:55:21,239 --> 00:55:23,239
So basically, what happened here is a pretty

1213
00:55:23,239 --> 00:55:25,239
good example. You can see on the whiteboard

1214
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:27,239
we just had a big brainstorm

1215
00:55:27,239 --> 00:55:29,239
where Jeremy would be like, here are the sort

1216
00:55:29,239 --> 00:55:31,239
of touch points I want. I want

1217
00:55:31,239 --> 00:55:33,239
the moment where the movers come out

1218
00:55:33,239 --> 00:55:35,239
and deliver the item that chat picked for.

1219
00:55:35,239 --> 00:55:37,239
I want the moment where chat picks for me to go to the bathroom

1220
00:55:37,239 --> 00:55:39,239
80 times and I have to

1221
00:55:39,239 --> 00:55:41,239
keep doing it and

1222
00:55:41,239 --> 00:55:43,929
from there we kind of extrapolated this

1223
00:55:43,929 --> 00:55:45,929
show format and the different

1224
00:55:45,929 --> 00:55:47,929
stages of like going to sleep and then buy

1225
00:55:47,929 --> 00:55:49,929
mode happening, live mode being

1226
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:51,929
whenever he's awake, placement mode

1227
00:55:51,929 --> 00:55:53,929
happening after that where they can pick where in the room

1228
00:55:53,929 --> 00:55:56,300
and then we also worked backwards from

1229
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:58,300
how many days we wanted to shoot and how we wanted

1230
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:00,300
the set to kind of evolve

1231
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:02,300
over those. So the small

1232
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:04,300
house, the buy upgrade, how much

1233
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:06,300
money we think that should cost,

1234
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:08,300
how we can incentivize chat to then spend

1235
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:10,300
that money to upgrade the house.

1236
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:13,369
All these things were discussed

1237
00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:15,369
and thought out ahead of time and we were basically given this

1238
00:56:15,369 --> 00:56:17,369
big list of

1239
00:56:17,369 --> 00:56:19,369
would be nice, this is what we want and then we went

1240
00:56:19,369 --> 00:56:21,369
and built the extension over the

1241
00:56:21,369 --> 00:56:23,369
remaining couple months

1242
00:56:23,369 --> 00:56:25,369
and then came back and ran the thing live

1243
00:56:25,369 --> 00:56:27,539
with everyone.

1244
00:56:27,539 --> 00:56:29,539
It's crazy how much

1245
00:56:29,539 --> 00:56:31,719
of this original brainstorm made it in

1246
00:56:31,719 --> 00:56:33,719
not to think about it. There was so much

1247
00:56:33,719 --> 00:56:36,150
we had and I think

1248
00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:38,710
it was pretty much all there.

1249
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:41,210
It's actually shocking.

1250
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:43,210
It really is and Chad's actually picking out some

1251
00:56:43,210 --> 00:56:45,210
pieces from this image that I put

1252
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:47,210
up that I probably should have looked at before I put it up.

1253
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:49,210
No, we're good.

1254
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:51,210
But I think it's a good time to actually

1255
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:53,210
talk about sort of

1256
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:55,210
sponsorship and how this whole thing

1257
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:57,210
came together

1258
00:56:57,210 --> 00:56:59,210
and so Jeremy had this idea like

1259
00:56:59,210 --> 00:57:01,210
two years ago. I remember getting a phone call. I actually remember

1260
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:03,210
exactly where I was when he called me

1261
00:57:03,210 --> 00:57:05,380
because Jeremy calls me a lot and he

1262
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,380
has a lot of ideas and

1263
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:09,380
a lot of those ideas are great and a lot of those ideas

1264
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:11,380
are just like completely insane

1265
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:13,380
but that's what makes it work, right?

1266
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:15,380
And I remember him calling

1267
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:17,380
me with this idea and my immediate reaction was

1268
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:19,380
this is amazing, we have to do this.

1269
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:21,380
And it was

1270
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:23,380
like over a year that we were looking for money

1271
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:25,380
to do this because we knew that we couldn't

1272
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:27,380
do it alone. This is an extraordinarily

1273
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:29,380
expensive production

1274
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:31,380
as you can imagine. You saw there were

1275
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:33,380
well over 30 crew on site plus

1276
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:35,380
all the pre-production, plus all the set,

1277
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:37,380
plus all the gear, plus all the travel.

1278
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:39,380
I mean it adds up really quickly.

1279
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:41,750
And so

1280
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:43,750
finally at the beginning of this year

1281
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:45,750
Twitch became interested in the show

1282
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:47,750
and we started negotiating with them

1283
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:49,750
and we came to a deal which included

1284
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:51,750
a certain number of

1285
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:53,750
hours streamed as well as a certain

1286
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:55,750
number of minutes of ads run at an ad

1287
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:57,750
density which is why we're running ads on today's

1288
00:57:57,750 --> 00:57:59,750
show for instance because it's part

1289
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:01,750
of that package deal. But Twitch

1290
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:03,750
really gave us an incredible amount of money

1291
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:05,750
to make this happen.

1292
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:07,750
And we also were then shopping

1293
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:09,750
for additional sponsors because we knew that the amount

1294
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:11,750
that Twitch gave us was not going to be enough to cover

1295
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:13,929
the entire show. It was a

1296
00:58:13,929 --> 00:58:15,929
great start. It was enough where

1297
00:58:15,929 --> 00:58:17,929
if Jeremy had to do it out of pocket, I don't think

1298
00:58:17,929 --> 00:58:19,929
it would bankrupt him, but

1299
00:58:19,929 --> 00:58:21,929
it definitely

1300
00:58:21,929 --> 00:58:23,929
No, not really.

1301
00:58:23,929 --> 00:58:25,929
But it was a

1302
00:58:25,929 --> 00:58:27,929
good start but we definitely were looking for more. And so

1303
00:58:27,929 --> 00:58:29,929
we were shopping around and

1304
00:58:29,929 --> 00:58:31,929
some folks pointed out some potential

1305
00:58:31,929 --> 00:58:33,929
sponsors that were there on the board at that time,

1306
00:58:33,929 --> 00:58:35,929
none of which panned out.

1307
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:37,929
But it really was

1308
00:58:37,929 --> 00:58:39,929
the addition of Ludwig

1309
00:58:39,929 --> 00:58:41,929
less than two weeks before the show

1310
00:58:41,929 --> 00:58:43,929
and his idea about going to

1311
00:58:43,929 --> 00:58:45,929
Coinbase and saying hey

1312
00:58:45,929 --> 00:58:47,929
Coinbase, can you

1313
00:58:47,929 --> 00:58:49,929
is there anything you can do to help

1314
00:58:49,929 --> 00:58:51,929
these guys out? And they were

1315
00:58:51,929 --> 00:58:53,929
unbelievable, just completely phenomenal

1316
00:58:53,929 --> 00:58:55,929
in the turnaround time and the flexibility

1317
00:58:55,929 --> 00:58:57,929
that they gave us. I mean they basically told us

1318
00:58:57,929 --> 00:58:59,929
you don't have to do anything. Can you show our logo on screen

1319
00:58:59,929 --> 00:59:01,929
and can you shout us out once? And that's

1320
00:59:01,929 --> 00:59:03,929
the only content

1321
00:59:03,929 --> 00:59:05,929
that we want.

1322
00:59:05,929 --> 00:59:08,230
They honestly just wanted to

1323
00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:10,659
have the show be good.

1324
00:59:10,659 --> 00:59:12,659
That was incredibly surprising because

1325
00:59:12,659 --> 00:59:15,030
there's been plenty of opportunities

1326
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:17,030
and Community Jake's been around for quite

1327
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:19,030
a while now, last at least three years.

1328
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:21,030
We've had potential opportunities in the past.

1329
00:59:21,030 --> 00:59:23,719
Not just saying that you've been around in the community, man.

1330
00:59:23,719 --> 00:59:25,719
I'm older than you, I got

1331
00:59:25,719 --> 00:59:27,719
a lot of years on you, don't worry.

1332
00:59:27,719 --> 00:59:30,150
But in the past there's been

1333
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:32,150
opportunities to do stuff before,

1334
00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:34,150
but not at the level that

1335
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:36,150
they were involved, Coinbase,

1336
00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:38,150
and they just wanted us to have a good show.

1337
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:40,150
They wasn't like, well you've got, hold on a minute,

1338
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:42,150
you've got to have like ten tweets,

1339
00:59:42,150 --> 00:59:44,150
I need to hear about this, you need to do a full

1340
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:46,150
ad in the middle of the, we need to actually

1341
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:48,150
talk about like seven or eight ads. No.

1342
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:50,460
They just let us do whatever we wanted. And they just

1343
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:52,460
wanted to be part of it. It was awesome.

1344
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:54,460
It was the best experience

1345
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:56,820
with any type of sponsor

1346
00:59:56,820 --> 00:59:59,059
I've ever had in ten years. And that's why

1347
00:59:59,059 --> 01:00:01,059
you never see sponsors on this channel. Ever.

1348
01:00:01,059 --> 01:00:03,500
Because I want

1349
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:05,500
to be able to do cool shows

1350
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:07,739
and not have to

1351
01:00:07,739 --> 01:00:09,739
have to do something I don't want to do, or have to be intrusive

1352
01:00:09,739 --> 01:00:11,739
in the show, and

1353
01:00:11,739 --> 01:00:13,739
I know that's a concern for a lot of people

1354
01:00:13,739 --> 01:00:15,980
here too, is, oh you're going to get a sponsor

1355
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:17,980
but are they going to fuck up the whole show

1356
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:19,980
and now all of a sudden it's going to be

1357
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:22,219
a shitty project, now it's like

1358
01:00:22,219 --> 01:00:24,219
it's taken over by a sponsor.

1359
01:00:24,219 --> 01:00:26,219
I'm never going to let that happen. I never want

1360
01:00:26,219 --> 01:00:28,519
that to happen. So, finding

1361
01:00:28,519 --> 01:00:30,519
people, finding sponsors that actually will

1362
01:00:30,519 --> 01:00:32,820
work with us and care about the projects

1363
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:35,639
that we do, that's how it's going

1364
01:00:35,639 --> 01:00:37,639
to be. And if we can't make

1365
01:00:37,639 --> 01:00:40,329
something happen, if we can't work something out, then

1366
01:00:40,329 --> 01:00:42,329
that's too bad, right? We'll figure something

1367
01:00:42,329 --> 01:00:44,329
else out. But I want to like kind of squelch

1368
01:00:44,329 --> 01:00:46,500
some of those concerns too, that people

1369
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,500
think that, oh here come the sponsors!

1370
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:50,500
It's over! It's like,

1371
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:52,500
no, we're going to be fine. No,

1372
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:54,500
they made it happen. They really

1373
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:56,500
made it happen. At least I'm super grateful.

1374
01:00:56,500 --> 01:01:00,659
Alright, now that we've

1375
01:01:00,659 --> 01:01:02,659
got that piece out of the way. Also, one quick

1376
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,659
little thing too,

1377
01:01:04,659 --> 01:01:06,659
something very, very interesting to note is this was

1378
01:01:06,659 --> 01:01:08,659
at the very beginning, when this was in the

1379
01:01:08,659 --> 01:01:10,900
concept stage, this was going to be one

1380
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:13,340
stream. This was not going to be more than one

1381
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:15,340
stream and we kind of had so much going on

1382
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:17,340
that it was like, maybe this should

1383
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,900
be two, maybe this should be three

1384
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:21,900
and then with Twitch being involved we kind

1385
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:24,139
of had to figure out what kind of show we

1386
01:01:24,139 --> 01:01:26,380
wanted, but this was only supposed to be one stream

1387
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:29,260
in the initial phase. We're just thinking

1388
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:31,260
about that now, that's impossible.

1389
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:33,690
So much stuff.

1390
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:35,690
Looking at some of these numbers and seeing the

1391
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:37,690
estimation of, oh we'll have two to three

1392
01:01:37,690 --> 01:01:39,690
live mode polls a day

1393
01:01:39,690 --> 01:01:41,690
and live mode, it'll be like

1394
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:43,690
10 to 30 minutes for each day and it's like

1395
01:01:43,690 --> 01:01:45,860
that didn't happen. We ended up doing

1396
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:47,860
12 every day and there was

1397
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:49,860
rapid fire, constantly things

1398
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:51,860
happening and so it's funny, even

1399
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:53,860
our estimations here were really modest

1400
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:56,039
as to what it actually ended up being.

1401
01:01:56,039 --> 01:01:58,280
There's a lot of really cool

1402
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:00,280
stuff here, I think, like a time capsule of

1403
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:02,579
the evolution of thinking

1404
01:02:02,579 --> 01:02:04,579
through how the show could work.

1405
01:02:04,579 --> 01:02:06,579
The other cool one that I have here is about the timeline

1406
01:02:06,579 --> 01:02:08,889
about how this came together.

1407
01:02:08,889 --> 01:02:10,889
This is when we met

1408
01:02:10,889 --> 01:02:12,889
in Indiana on site.

1409
01:02:12,889 --> 01:02:14,889
Look at him in the corner.

1410
01:02:14,889 --> 01:02:16,889
It's such a great photo.

1411
01:02:16,889 --> 01:02:18,889
It looks like the beginning of May maybe.

1412
01:02:18,889 --> 01:02:21,579
What's going on?

1413
01:02:21,579 --> 01:02:23,820
He's having a stroke.

1414
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:25,820
What am I doing? Am I asleep?

1415
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:29,000
Chad, did I

1416
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
fix Jeremy's audio?

1417
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Are you happy with Jeremy's audio?

1418
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
I was an issue with people.

1419
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
They say I'm coming out of both ears.

1420
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
People that had

1421
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
cell phones have a single speaker.

1422
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
We've seen this issue before. I think I solved it.

1423
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
People are happy now.

1424
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
We met

1425
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
at Antimark. This is still

1426
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
months into the production but at this point now

1427
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
we're at a place where we've identified Ghost Commander

1428
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
and Kraken and his team as partners

1429
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
and identified Antimark as partners

1430
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
and all that.

1431
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
We came together for a site meeting

1432
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
at Antimark in early May and you can see

1433
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
that the plan here

1434
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
was week by week, here's the check-ins,

1435
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
here's what we're looking for on these days

1436
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
and here's

1437
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
our stream dates and here's what's going to happen that week.

1438
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
We pretty much stuck to this

1439
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
within a week I would say.

1440
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,179
Something in the middle there is really

1441
01:03:21,179 --> 01:03:23,670
interesting. There's one thing

1442
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:25,670
that I regret didn't happen. I don't know if you want to

1443
01:03:25,670 --> 01:03:27,670
talk about it, Jeremy.

1444
01:03:27,670 --> 01:03:29,670
I think you're about to say it.

1445
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:31,670
We originally had planned

1446
01:03:31,670 --> 01:03:33,670
to test out the live mode

1447
01:03:33,670 --> 01:03:35,670
chat voting for different things for him to do

1448
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:37,670
on the Catboy stream

1449
01:03:37,670 --> 01:03:39,909
where he would be a cat

1450
01:03:39,909 --> 01:03:41,909
and the concept was we would take

1451
01:03:41,909 --> 01:03:43,909
the same tools we're already developing for the end

1452
01:03:43,909 --> 01:03:45,909
where we would be able to send him

1453
01:03:45,909 --> 01:03:47,909
to do different cat things

1454
01:03:47,909 --> 01:03:49,909
and it would be all done through chat

1455
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:52,409
and the extension but because

1456
01:03:52,409 --> 01:03:54,409
of the timeline it didn't quite line up.

1457
01:03:54,409 --> 01:03:56,409
We were going to get a big scratching

1458
01:03:56,409 --> 01:03:58,409
post back here and actually this is

1459
01:03:58,409 --> 01:04:00,409
great behind the scenes stuff. I wanted

1460
01:04:00,409 --> 01:04:02,409
to have a litter box. Remember

1461
01:04:02,409 --> 01:04:04,409
I told you this and you were like no we're not doing a litter box.

1462
01:04:04,409 --> 01:04:06,409
He was so insistent on the litter box.

1463
01:04:06,409 --> 01:04:08,409
Constantly talking about it.

1464
01:04:08,409 --> 01:04:10,969
I was going to go like shit in the litter box.

1465
01:04:10,969 --> 01:04:12,969
He's like I don't want to do the show if I

1466
01:04:12,969 --> 01:04:14,969
can't shit in the litter box and we're like please Jeremy

1467
01:04:14,969 --> 01:04:16,969
we have so much other stuff we have to do

1468
01:04:16,969 --> 01:04:18,969
please don't get banned this early on the cat thing.

1469
01:04:22,969 --> 01:04:24,969
We wound up swapping

1470
01:04:24,969 --> 01:04:26,969
that with the hot tub stream.

1471
01:04:26,969 --> 01:04:28,969
We wound up doing the hot tub stream which featured

1472
01:04:28,969 --> 01:04:30,969
Catboy I think to placate chat a little

1473
01:04:30,969 --> 01:04:34,420
bit.

1474
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:36,420
The tools are now built so

1475
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:38,420
the potential for a Catboy stream down the line

1476
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:40,420
using the same dollhouse stuff.

1477
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:42,420
They're there. The tools are there.

1478
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:44,420
I think chat wants it.

1479
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:46,420
I can't shit in the litter box.

1480
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:49,050
If I can't shit in the litter box.

1481
01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:51,349
I was going to like you know those

1482
01:04:51,349 --> 01:04:53,349
litter boxes with a dome. I wanted

1483
01:04:53,349 --> 01:04:55,349
to just like go climb in one and like sit

1484
01:04:55,349 --> 01:04:57,980
in it.

1485
01:04:57,980 --> 01:05:00,409
Yeah just like stick my

1486
01:05:00,409 --> 01:05:02,409
head just stick it out like whatever.

1487
01:05:02,409 --> 01:05:04,409
Jake you

1488
01:05:04,409 --> 01:05:06,409
guys tell me my ideas are good. Sometimes the ideas

1489
01:05:06,409 --> 01:05:08,409
are bad. Maybe I get banned

1490
01:05:08,409 --> 01:05:10,409
permanently from Twitch. That would have been bad right

1491
01:05:10,409 --> 01:05:12,579
before the show.

1492
01:05:12,579 --> 01:05:14,949
We can try it now if you want.

1493
01:05:14,949 --> 01:05:16,949
Now the show's over.

1494
01:05:16,949 --> 01:05:19,260
Not that the show's over. No.

1495
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:21,429
Alright next up.

1496
01:05:21,429 --> 01:05:23,429
I want to

1497
01:05:23,429 --> 01:05:25,429
talk about the dream sequence.

1498
01:05:25,429 --> 01:05:28,059
And Jeremy

1499
01:05:28,059 --> 01:05:30,059
and I had a heated discussion before the show

1500
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:32,059
and we've decided not to show

1501
01:05:32,059 --> 01:05:34,059
the original dream sequence

1502
01:05:34,059 --> 01:05:36,059
for

1503
01:05:36,059 --> 01:05:38,059
the rehearsal one.

1504
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:40,059
For

1505
01:05:40,059 --> 01:05:42,059
risk of

1506
01:05:42,059 --> 01:05:44,059
some TOS issues.

1507
01:05:44,059 --> 01:05:46,059
It was so fucked up. It was just fucked up.

1508
01:05:46,059 --> 01:05:48,059
And I'm just like I don't want to do this.

1509
01:05:48,059 --> 01:05:50,059
This is fucked up. We're changing this.

1510
01:05:50,059 --> 01:05:52,059
This is too fucked up. Alright just to get

1511
01:05:52,059 --> 01:05:54,059
I was on the toilet.

1512
01:05:54,059 --> 01:05:56,059
Okay so let me just

1513
01:05:56,059 --> 01:05:58,489
paint the picture here. I'm just going to describe it.

1514
01:05:58,489 --> 01:06:00,489
I don't want to show it. It's weird and creepy

1515
01:06:00,489 --> 01:06:02,489
and I don't like it. So originally

1516
01:06:02,489 --> 01:06:05,050
we were just going to have me on the toilet.

1517
01:06:05,050 --> 01:06:07,050
You can just mute it and play it.

1518
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:09,610
Alright so originally

1519
01:06:09,610 --> 01:06:11,610
I was going to be on the toilet

1520
01:06:11,610 --> 01:06:14,360
for the whole dream. And it was like

1521
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:16,360
I'm just sitting there and I just hear like

1522
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:18,599
fart noises and like shit sounds.

1523
01:06:18,599 --> 01:06:20,599
And by the way there was a shit sound

1524
01:06:20,599 --> 01:06:22,599
that

1525
01:06:22,599 --> 01:06:24,599
during that segment

1526
01:06:24,599 --> 01:06:26,599
where it was a real shit.

1527
01:06:26,599 --> 01:06:28,599
It was real shit coming out of somebody's ass.

1528
01:06:28,599 --> 01:06:30,599
I swear to god.

1529
01:06:30,599 --> 01:06:32,599
It was like so realistic sounding

1530
01:06:32,599 --> 01:06:34,599
and I was like I don't want this

1531
01:06:34,599 --> 01:06:36,599
to play right now.

1532
01:06:36,599 --> 01:06:38,599
It was an extended.

1533
01:06:38,599 --> 01:06:40,599
Can we time out here for one second? I have a clip of you

1534
01:06:40,599 --> 01:06:42,599
talking about that shit sound.

1535
01:06:42,599 --> 01:06:44,599
He's going to play the fart sound.

1536
01:06:44,599 --> 01:06:46,599
He's going to play the shitting sound.

1537
01:06:46,599 --> 01:06:48,599
You guys

1538
01:06:48,599 --> 01:06:50,599
Oh my god.

1539
01:06:50,599 --> 01:06:52,599
The audio guy has a folder only for

1540
01:06:52,599 --> 01:06:54,599
bodily functions.

1541
01:06:54,599 --> 01:06:56,599
And originally he was playing

1542
01:06:56,599 --> 01:06:58,599
when I was sitting down

1543
01:06:58,599 --> 01:07:00,599
like realistic foley

1544
01:07:00,599 --> 01:07:02,599
of somebody shitting into water.

1545
01:07:04,599 --> 01:07:06,599
And I was just like

1546
01:07:06,599 --> 01:07:08,599
that can't be used.

1547
01:07:08,599 --> 01:07:10,599
It was horrible.

1548
01:07:10,599 --> 01:07:12,599
It's super real.

1549
01:07:12,599 --> 01:07:14,599
I can't picture it.

1550
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:18,599
You know that sound.

1551
01:07:18,599 --> 01:07:20,599
That's like the public bathroom washing

1552
01:07:20,599 --> 01:07:22,599
your hands.

1553
01:07:22,599 --> 01:07:24,599
Just hear that fucking thing.

1554
01:07:24,599 --> 01:07:26,599
No way.

1555
01:07:26,599 --> 01:07:28,599
He's got like a fucking hundred of them.

1556
01:07:30,599 --> 01:07:32,599
You know what's funny to me too is that

1557
01:07:32,599 --> 01:07:34,780
some of the bits

1558
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:36,780
like that Jerma would do during the show

1559
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:38,780
would be to yell at the fart guy.

1560
01:07:38,780 --> 01:07:40,780
And I had a hard time telling when he was serious

1561
01:07:40,780 --> 01:07:42,780
of he was really not wanting as many

1562
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:44,780
farts or that was just part of the bit.

1563
01:07:44,780 --> 01:07:46,780
Maybe Jerma you can help

1564
01:07:46,780 --> 01:07:49,849
hop in on that.

1565
01:07:49,849 --> 01:07:51,849
By the third day I think I walked over

1566
01:07:51,849 --> 01:07:53,849
to the audio station

1567
01:07:53,849 --> 01:07:55,849
and I was like maybe like one an hour

1568
01:07:55,849 --> 01:07:57,849
maybe like two an hour.

1569
01:07:57,849 --> 01:07:59,849
I was like maybe like three farts an hour.

1570
01:07:59,849 --> 01:08:02,150
And you're like yeah yeah okay.

1571
01:08:02,150 --> 01:08:04,150
Rationing farts.

1572
01:08:04,150 --> 01:08:06,389
Alright so you call out the fart quarter

1573
01:08:06,389 --> 01:08:08,889
numerous times.

1574
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:13,380
When he was in the shower

1575
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:15,380
and you're like don't do it again, don't do it again.

1576
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:17,380
And he kept sneaking out.

1577
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:19,380
I'm done. And you leave the shower.

1578
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:21,380
By the end of the show, I mean I don't want to skip ahead but like

1579
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:23,380
you can see like Jerry was like so

1580
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:25,380
like you were just testing us. You're like

1581
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:27,380
you were throwing random shit at the production team

1582
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:29,380
to see what they would deal with

1583
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:31,380
like a wrench through the plans. I don't know what

1584
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:33,380
got into you during that but we were like

1585
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:35,380
we were like what is he doing?

1586
01:08:35,380 --> 01:08:37,619
Let's just see what they can handle.

1587
01:08:37,619 --> 01:08:39,619
Every single fart you broke

1588
01:08:39,619 --> 01:08:41,930
character laughed.

1589
01:08:41,930 --> 01:08:43,930
The worst.

1590
01:08:43,930 --> 01:08:45,930
Because I can hear it. What you guys

1591
01:08:45,930 --> 01:08:47,930
didn't know is a lot of the sound effects

1592
01:08:47,930 --> 01:08:49,930
I hear them like in my ear and like I can hear them

1593
01:08:49,930 --> 01:08:51,930
listening to them. So I'm just sitting there

1594
01:08:51,930 --> 01:08:53,930
like in the shower and I just hear this loud

1595
01:08:53,930 --> 01:08:55,930
just rip ass and I'm just like

1596
01:08:55,930 --> 01:08:58,680
I wouldn't do that.

1597
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:00,680
So I just have to listen to it

1598
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:03,050
and react to it. The worst thing that you did

1599
01:09:03,050 --> 01:09:05,050
to us Jeremy and

1600
01:09:05,050 --> 01:09:07,050
I think this is the appropriate time to talk about this.

1601
01:09:07,050 --> 01:09:09,050
This is the production side of things. The worst thing

1602
01:09:09,050 --> 01:09:11,289
that you did to us was during the party

1603
01:09:11,289 --> 01:09:13,289
when you picked up the phone to call

1604
01:09:13,289 --> 01:09:15,289
guests and

1605
01:09:15,289 --> 01:09:17,289
you said I'm going to call Edna

1606
01:09:17,289 --> 01:09:19,590
and then you turn

1607
01:09:19,590 --> 01:09:21,590
to the camera and say see how this fucks

1608
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:23,590
them up and then continue going

1609
01:09:23,590 --> 01:09:25,899
because Kit needed

1610
01:09:25,899 --> 01:09:27,899
to be the police officer for the

1611
01:09:27,899 --> 01:09:29,899
party to work. The only way the party

1612
01:09:29,899 --> 01:09:31,899
would work is if Kit was the police officer and so

1613
01:09:31,899 --> 01:09:33,899
you knew that you were just going to

1614
01:09:33,899 --> 01:09:35,899
fuck us up and so that's why the party is paced

1615
01:09:35,899 --> 01:09:37,899
like so weird because Edna

1616
01:09:37,899 --> 01:09:39,899
comes with all the guests and

1617
01:09:39,899 --> 01:09:41,899
then we have to somehow figure out a way to

1618
01:09:41,899 --> 01:09:43,899
get Edna to leave and then he has to go and do

1619
01:09:43,899 --> 01:09:45,899
the hardest costume change on the entire

1620
01:09:45,899 --> 01:09:47,899
thing that we can do and he'll talk about that

1621
01:09:47,899 --> 01:09:49,899
a little bit later but like that

1622
01:09:49,899 --> 01:09:51,899
that has a different voice

1623
01:09:51,899 --> 01:09:53,899
so you have to prep her voice because it's already

1624
01:09:53,899 --> 01:09:55,899
been converted at that point back to being Kit's

1625
01:09:55,899 --> 01:09:58,069
voice. Yeah so thanks Jeremy

1626
01:09:58,069 --> 01:10:00,069
that was fun. But that also

1627
01:10:00,069 --> 01:10:02,069
gave way to like a conspiracy

1628
01:10:02,069 --> 01:10:04,069
threat on reddit I saw of like

1629
01:10:04,069 --> 01:10:06,069
is Edna dead because the last we see her

1630
01:10:06,069 --> 01:10:08,069
she's in the pool and like death

1631
01:10:08,069 --> 01:10:10,069
and the clown are talking about Edna

1632
01:10:10,069 --> 01:10:12,069
and then suddenly Edna disappears and everyone's like

1633
01:10:12,069 --> 01:10:14,069
oh my god they fucking killed her off

1634
01:10:14,069 --> 01:10:16,069
off camera and

1635
01:10:16,069 --> 01:10:18,069
like hey you know maybe it's a possibility

1636
01:10:18,069 --> 01:10:21,079
now in canon. I think another

1637
01:10:21,079 --> 01:10:23,079
hard audio piece for Mark was

1638
01:10:23,079 --> 01:10:25,079
the doorbell because he where he was positioned

1639
01:10:25,079 --> 01:10:27,079
in front of a house you couldn't see the doorbell

1640
01:10:27,079 --> 01:10:29,079
so people especially German would sit there

1641
01:10:29,079 --> 01:10:31,079
and like poke the doorbell so I could see

1642
01:10:31,079 --> 01:10:33,079
it on camera I'd be like doorbell doorbell doorbell doorbelt doorbell

1643
01:10:33,079 --> 01:10:35,079
doorbelt kilarti

1644
01:10:35,079 --> 01:10:37,079
moment of flush

1645
01:10:37,079 --> 01:10:39,079
where the audio booth was positioned I had the

1646
01:10:39,079 --> 01:10:41,079
first yard to my left and I had the toilet to my

1647
01:10:41,079 --> 01:10:43,079
right but because of the forced perspective I

1648
01:10:43,079 --> 01:10:47,079
have line of sight to the doorbell itself or the toilet flusher so like I'm

1649
01:10:47,079 --> 01:10:49,560
trying to watch your camera shots to see when I'm gonna hit the doorbell button

1650
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:53,359
or when I'm gonna hit the toilet flusher so yeah so you can see what this looks

1651
01:10:53,359 --> 01:10:58,029
like here that was uh that was tough and then Jeremy starts fucking with me and

1652
01:10:58,029 --> 01:11:03,920
he's like I didn't press it yeah well cuz I've started to do like these

1653
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:07,800
incredibly animated movements before I flushed so give you like a second or two

1654
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:11,119
to be able to cue it up you know being like oh I'm gonna flush the toilet ah

1655
01:11:11,119 --> 01:11:18,270
no and I like reach down and touch it or whatever showers was really nice all

1656
01:11:18,270 --> 01:11:22,029
right so but battle station I do I do want to talk with a dream sequence

1657
01:11:22,029 --> 01:11:29,050
though I have a cool clip here of the dream sequence being incepted and like

1658
01:11:29,050 --> 01:11:33,729
sort of the idea behind it and then I have the the clip of the dream sequence

1659
01:11:33,729 --> 01:11:39,449
playing out but with the crew audio in ear and you'll hear Bobby calling calling

1660
01:11:39,449 --> 01:11:43,189
that so we just read well I think I think we discovered yeah we got a ray

1661
01:11:43,189 --> 01:11:47,329
from what we see right coming up Ludwig is in the building

1662
01:11:47,329 --> 01:11:52,340
look like his hair should I find an embarrassing clip of Ludwig to play

1663
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:58,189
before we start here or is there a boy yeah I think I got one here there we go

1664
01:11:58,189 --> 01:12:03,750
this is I mean it's it's not a barrister

1665
01:12:09,279 --> 01:12:13,800
that was awesome I can only do a lot yeah dude you did it like flawlessly a lot

1666
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:40,310
it literally sounded perfect we were sitting back there going there we go I

1667
01:12:40,310 --> 01:12:45,210
can't believe he did that perfectly like everyone's a musician like every single

1668
01:12:45,210 --> 01:12:48,779
person that touched that thing knew how to play and we were like on we didn't

1669
01:12:48,779 --> 01:12:51,340
know how to deal with as production team really I guess we stay on this for like

1670
01:12:51,340 --> 01:12:56,359
the next five minutes we also didn't know that we didn't think it worked

1671
01:12:56,359 --> 01:13:05,520
until we got it there all right so let's go ahead and play this is the crew call

1672
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:10,489
clip this is I'm gonna play I'm gonna play not the whole thing but just a few

1673
01:13:10,489 --> 01:13:16,960
seconds of the inception and then and then we'll play the bad dream was to me

1674
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:38,020
like gladiator versus like warrior and like I could get up so like they'll

1675
01:13:38,020 --> 01:13:43,300
just be doing like something in the road and I'm just very happy about it so

1676
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:49,300
we're talking about safe place to insert right that's a way for the rest of

1677
01:13:49,300 --> 01:14:09,300
it's happening so the thought that we have is around the dream scene especially because if the idea is for them not to interact with you, you can't just be one of the various to be someone else so can we if you're either the gladiator or the warrior and you're the cowboy can we just come up with two different scenarios for it?

1678
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:16,600
something I never thought I'd say. I don't know if that makes sense. What color are the morph suits? Black.

1679
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:24,600
I was gonna say what if we had someone with black morphs like moving his arms like do what I say Jerma. That's right, go through the door now. What the fuck, I'm being controlled.

1680
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:27,600
That's actually not a bad idea, it'd be a morph suit.

1681
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:30,600
I want like a visual too, like something that's supposed to be there.

1682
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:33,600
I want Ludwig as a cowboy.

1683
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:40,600
I think that's good because there's no confusion on whether this is just the sexy nurse at night actually coming out.

1684
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:44,600
Sexy nurse.

1685
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:46,600
He kept saying that, he kept saying sexy nurse.

1686
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:49,600
He kept calling us sexy nurse.

1687
01:14:49,600 --> 01:15:07,220
So, here's the clip, that goes on and to give chat an idea, the idea of the dream sequence was not something that you chose to happen right the dream sequence is just something that happened, but then you got to choose whether it was a good dream or a bad dream.

1688
01:15:07,220 --> 01:15:17,720
So, if we actually, if we let that clip play on a little bit longer, we talk about like well what would a good dream be and what would a bad dream be because we need both of those to work.

1689
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:22,720
Even though we were about 99% sure that you would choose a bad dream, which of course you did.

1690
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:33,720
So, here again we're not gonna play the rehearsal one, but here's how it played out and you can hear Bobby calling this as it plays out.

1691
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:34,720
You want to reset Scott.

1692
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:35,720
Give me another move.

1693
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:36,720
Ready 13.

1694
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:37,720
Kraken is ready.

1695
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:43,409
And take 13.

1696
01:15:43,409 --> 01:15:49,220
Are we having a bunch of people in room four for the end of this bit?

1697
01:15:49,220 --> 01:15:52,220
Let me know when to send Kraken.

1698
01:15:52,220 --> 01:15:58,220
My question is are the multitude of people that we're having in room four for the end of the bit, are they ready?

1699
01:15:58,220 --> 01:15:59,220
I can get them ready right now.

1700
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:00,220
Yeah.

1701
01:16:00,220 --> 01:16:01,220
Jizz is working.

1702
01:16:01,220 --> 01:16:02,220
Are we going to sleep here?

1703
01:16:02,220 --> 01:16:03,220
Yep.

1704
01:16:03,220 --> 01:16:08,039
Go to sleep in three, two, one.

1705
01:16:08,039 --> 01:16:11,300
Go to sleep and kill his mic.

1706
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:12,300
Okay.

1707
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:16,020
Go dream sequence.

1708
01:16:16,020 --> 01:16:19,600

Open Kraken's mic.

1713
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:29,310
Once Kraken's in the room, we slowly bring in lights.

01:16:48,119 --> 01:16:49,119
We're saying NASA audio.

1732
01:16:49,119 --> 01:16:50,119
Bad dream.

1733
01:16:50,119 --> 01:16:51,119

Oh yeah.

1740
01:17:01,359 --> 01:17:02,359
Kraken.

1741
01:17:02,359 --> 01:17:04,359
Have them come between rooms three and four into the kitchen.

1742
01:17:04,359 --> 01:17:06,359
Are we showing them right now?

1743
01:17:06,359 --> 01:17:08,359
Don't show the kitchen, no.

1744
01:17:08,359 --> 01:17:09,359
Okay.

1745
01:17:09,359 --> 01:17:10,359
Do not show the kitchen.

1746
01:17:10,359 --> 01:17:11,359
They're just loading.

1747
01:17:11,359 --> 01:17:12,359
Ready 8.

1748
01:17:12,359 --> 01:17:14,359
We need to get that TV thing out of the way.

1749
01:17:14,359 --> 01:17:15,359
Get what?

1750
01:17:15,359 --> 01:17:17,359
Ask Kraken to move the TV stand.

1751
01:17:17,359 --> 01:17:18,359
Ready 8.

1752
01:17:18,359 --> 01:17:19,359
Take 8.

1753
01:17:19,359 --> 01:17:20,359
Ready 13.

1754
01:17:20,359 --> 01:17:21,359
Take 13.

1755
01:17:21,359 --> 01:17:26,600
Kraken's mic's a little hot.

1756
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:29,800
Jib is working.

1757
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:31,800
I don't know what needs moved out of the way.

1758
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:32,800
No, that's good.

1759
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:33,800
It's good.

1760
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:34,800
Ready 8.

1761
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:35,800
Go tight on him, mate.

1762
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:36,800
Ready 8.

1763
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:37,800
Take 8.

1764
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:38,979
Ready 13.

1765
01:17:38,979 --> 01:17:40,220
Take 13.

1766
01:17:41,220 --> 01:17:44,220
Okay, is that it for people going into the kitchen?

1767
01:17:44,220 --> 01:17:45,220
That's it.

1768
01:17:45,220 --> 01:17:47,220
Nobody else goes out of the kitchen.

1769
01:17:47,220 --> 01:17:49,220
Ready room 4.

1770
01:17:49,220 --> 01:17:55,729
Dissolve room 4.

1771
01:17:55,729 --> 01:17:56,729
Ready 10.

1772
01:17:56,729 --> 01:17:59,159
I'm staying here on room 4.

1773
01:18:03,939 --> 01:18:13,430
Can we get Addy here?

1774
01:18:13,430 --> 01:18:14,430
Take 8.

1775
01:18:14,430 --> 01:18:16,430
They put him back to sleep when he'd wake up in daytime.

1776
01:18:16,430 --> 01:18:22,430
Ready 10.

1777
01:18:22,430 --> 01:18:23,430
Take 10.

1778
01:18:23,430 --> 01:18:25,819
Ready 9.

1779
01:18:25,819 --> 01:18:27,819
Who's supposed to fall asleep here?

1780
01:18:27,819 --> 01:18:28,819
Take 9.

1781
01:18:28,819 --> 01:18:30,819
Kill the dream sequence.

1782
01:18:30,819 --> 01:18:32,819
He's supposed to go back to sleep, right?

1783
01:18:32,819 --> 01:18:33,819
I thought I was awake.

1784
01:18:33,819 --> 01:18:34,819
Sleep.

1785
01:18:34,819 --> 01:18:35,819
Yeah, he should sleep.

1786
01:18:35,819 --> 01:18:36,819
And put him to sleep.

1787
01:18:36,819 --> 01:18:37,819
In 3, 2, 1.

1788
01:18:37,819 --> 01:18:38,819
Put him to sleep.

1789
01:18:38,819 --> 01:18:39,819
Ready 7.

1790
01:18:39,819 --> 01:18:44,140
Just go to sleep right there.

1791
01:18:44,140 --> 01:18:45,140
He's supposed to go to sleep right there.

1792
01:18:45,140 --> 01:18:46,140
Pass out.

1793
01:18:46,140 --> 01:18:47,140
Just pass out.

1794
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:48,140
Oh.

1795
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:49,140
Ready 7.

1796
01:18:49,140 --> 01:18:50,140
Take 7.

1797
01:18:50,140 --> 01:18:51,140
He's just walking.

1798
01:18:51,140 --> 01:18:52,140
Take 13.

1799
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:53,140
Take 13.

1800
01:18:53,140 --> 01:18:54,140
And stand by 7 again.

1801
01:18:54,140 --> 01:18:55,140
In 3, 2, 1.

1802
01:18:55,140 --> 01:18:56,140
Dissolve 7.

1803
01:18:56,140 --> 01:18:57,140
Kill his mic.

1804
01:18:57,140 --> 01:18:59,140
And we're going by mode here?

1805
01:18:59,140 --> 01:19:00,140
Nope.

1806
01:19:00,140 --> 01:19:01,140
Go daytime.

1807
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:02,140
Go daytime.

1808
01:19:02,140 --> 01:19:03,140
Wake him up.

1809
01:19:03,140 --> 01:19:04,140
What are we doing?

1810
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:05,140
We go daytime.

1811
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:07,140
Okay, stand by for daytime and camera 13.

1812
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:09,140
In 3, 2, 1.

1813
01:19:09,140 --> 01:19:10,140
Daytime.

1814
01:19:10,140 --> 01:19:14,170
And wake him up.

1815
01:19:14,170 --> 01:19:15,170
Ready 8.

1816
01:19:15,170 --> 01:19:22,420
That little bit at the end there, when he calls for daytime and wake him up, it just feels

1817
01:19:22,420 --> 01:19:28,619
like that moment in the Truman Show when Kristoff is like, okay, you know, ready daytime.

1818
01:19:28,619 --> 01:19:31,619
Everybody to their initial places or whatever.

1819
01:19:31,619 --> 01:19:33,859
It's just like so bizarre.

1820
01:19:34,859 --> 01:19:40,859
Originally, because we were trying to figure out, because Kraken was essentially back just

1821
01:19:40,859 --> 01:19:44,859
handling a ton of shit during, I'm sorry, a ton of shit during the whole show.

1822
01:19:44,859 --> 01:19:46,859
And we were like, how do we get him on camera?

1823
01:19:46,859 --> 01:19:48,859
Because we wanted him on camera, obviously.

1824
01:19:48,859 --> 01:19:52,859
And one of the ideas was actually to have him be like in a moon, right?

1825
01:19:52,859 --> 01:19:58,100
Just like looking down like inside of a moon, like giving some like commands or something.

1826
01:19:58,100 --> 01:20:03,520
But we didn't want to, we didn't want to like break the immersion, I guess, of the show.

1827
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:06,520
Because it was like, oh, we're going to both show everybody like backstage and like all

1828
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:07,520
the screens and stuff.

1829
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:09,520
And I think I was like, I don't want that.

1830
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:12,079
But originally you were going to be like in a moon.

1831
01:20:12,079 --> 01:20:13,079
Yeah, I'm glad it turned out this way.

1832
01:20:13,079 --> 01:20:20,079
I think crossing that like fourth wall into the actual room as this like disgusting Jesus

1833
01:20:20,079 --> 01:20:26,079
ripoff character was a nice little like transition.

1834
01:20:26,079 --> 01:20:30,260
And that still felt in the world, but also being an absolute fever dream.

1835
01:20:30,260 --> 01:20:34,260
Can we talk about how you had to wear that costume all day?

1836
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:38,260
Yeah, no, I didn't have time to paint.

1837
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:39,689
Yeah.

1838
01:20:39,689 --> 01:20:45,689
So since my duties had me like there until the final like 30 seconds before I appear on camera,

1839
01:20:45,689 --> 01:20:50,859
the entire day I just shoot it in a toga with no like pants or shoes on.

1840
01:20:50,859 --> 01:20:52,859
His hair is sitting on the table next to him.

1841
01:20:52,859 --> 01:20:53,859
Yeah.

1842
01:20:53,859 --> 01:20:55,859
He looks like he's going to the hospital.

1843
01:20:55,859 --> 01:20:57,859
Everyone was like, you're out.

1844
01:20:57,859 --> 01:21:00,100
He's got a surgery and I'm like, shut up.

1845
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:01,100
I'm supposed to be God.

1846
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:03,100
I like brought this wig around.

1847
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:05,100
I have to look like God.

1848
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:10,979
You were telling us that you had to drive the car a certain way because of your outfit.

1849
01:21:10,979 --> 01:21:12,220
Oh, yeah.

1850
01:21:12,220 --> 01:21:13,220
No.

1851
01:21:13,220 --> 01:21:17,590
So this is like, I mean, I'm a larger than average man.

1852
01:21:17,590 --> 01:21:24,770
And when I was in that little car, this toga was like way up to my waist and I had like

1853
01:21:24,770 --> 01:21:25,770
no pants on.

1854
01:21:25,770 --> 01:21:31,770
So I was like I had to like hunch over and then like I just like curved my back like

1855
01:21:31,770 --> 01:21:35,770
an absolute like caveman gremlin on the way in because I didn't want anyone to like upskirt

1856
01:21:35,770 --> 01:21:39,010
me as I'm like riding in on this like clown car.

1857
01:21:39,010 --> 01:21:41,010
It was a very surreal place to be.

1858
01:21:41,010 --> 01:21:45,010
But I pretty much blacked out the entire time I was on stage.

1859
01:21:45,010 --> 01:21:47,010
I did not remember what I said or when.

1860
01:21:47,010 --> 01:21:50,630
I was just kind of feeling it out.

1861
01:21:50,630 --> 01:21:51,869
Yeah.

1862
01:21:51,869 --> 01:21:55,869
The audio that you hear in that clip is is not specific to that clip that calls like

1863
01:21:55,869 --> 01:21:59,869
that for every camera and the stuff that all the movers that have those headsets on.

1864
01:21:59,869 --> 01:22:02,869
All of us that you've seen, like in these photos that have those headsets, we're hearing

1865
01:22:02,869 --> 01:22:03,869
that the whole time.

1866
01:22:03,869 --> 01:22:05,869
Bobby is very tired by the end of the day.

1867
01:22:05,869 --> 01:22:09,869
But that that's how those are called because it helps coordinate everybody like that's

1868
01:22:09,869 --> 01:22:10,869
moving.

1869
01:22:10,869 --> 01:22:13,869
That's why you very there's very few times we actually see a camera person in another

1870
01:22:13,869 --> 01:22:18,869
shot or the gym arm or something where because it's Bobby coordinates that with having to

1871
01:22:18,869 --> 01:22:19,869
get the gym out of the way and everything.

1872
01:22:19,869 --> 01:22:24,520
But you can talk more about this how it goes the whole time.

1873
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:26,529
Yeah.

1874
01:22:26,529 --> 01:22:31,529
I mean, I'm pretty much talking for the entire stream, just kind of directing cameras, helping

1875
01:22:31,529 --> 01:22:34,529
mark out on the audio side for what you know, because he's kind of looking down a lot at

1876
01:22:34,529 --> 01:22:35,529
his audio console.

1877
01:22:35,529 --> 01:22:38,529
So any cues I can give anybody on the crew.

1878
01:22:38,529 --> 01:22:42,699
Oh, and this scene here was probably my personal favorite.

1879
01:22:49,699 --> 01:22:51,699
What are we doing here?

1880
01:22:51,699 --> 01:22:54,329
Push it into his face if you can.

1881
01:22:54,329 --> 01:22:55,329
All the way tight.

1882
01:22:55,329 --> 01:22:57,079
Thirteen if you can.

1883
01:22:57,079 --> 01:23:00,300
Thirteen.

1884
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:02,739
Is that thirteen?

1885
01:23:02,739 --> 01:23:04,739
Thirteen.

1886
01:23:04,739 --> 01:23:08,739
Like as this was going on, I didn't know that Uncle Ted was going to make an appearance

1887
01:23:08,739 --> 01:23:10,739
and we kind of ended the day here.

1888
01:23:10,739 --> 01:23:13,100
None of us knew.

1889
01:23:13,100 --> 01:23:15,100
He just started doing this.

1890
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:18,100
Uncle Ted sits next to me, the person who played Uncle Ted, and he literally takes his

1891
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:19,100
headset off.

1892
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:20,100
He's like, I've got an idea.

1893
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:23,100
He just literally runs away from his desk that he's supposed to be at.

1894
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:26,100
I was like, I don't know where he's going or what we're doing.

1895
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:27,100
Yeah.

1896
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:29,100
So right here I told Mark to kill all the mics.

1897
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:30,100
We go tonight.

1898
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:33,100
And then all of a sudden I see this motion on eight and I'm like, oh God, oh God, we

1899
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:34,100
got to go back to this.

1900
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:35,729
We got to go back.

1901
01:23:35,729 --> 01:23:36,729
Which one is it?

1902
01:23:36,729 --> 01:23:37,729
Which one is it?

1903
01:23:37,729 --> 01:23:40,029
I need the light clear, Josh.

1904
01:23:40,029 --> 01:23:44,090
Is burglar ready?

1905
01:23:44,090 --> 01:23:46,090
I need thirty seconds on burglar.

1906
01:23:46,090 --> 01:23:48,090
So we're not going to go to bye mug.

1907
01:23:48,090 --> 01:23:50,090
Just let him do this.

1908
01:23:50,090 --> 01:23:54,090
The audio in the scene was weird because German's mic was active.

1909
01:23:54,090 --> 01:23:56,090
Are we not getting audio with this right now?

1910
01:23:56,090 --> 01:23:57,329
Is it all cleared?

1911
01:23:57,329 --> 01:23:58,329
Right.

1912
01:23:58,329 --> 01:24:00,329
Yeah, because Bobby told me to clear the mic.

1913
01:24:00,329 --> 01:24:02,329
So it's all cleared.

1914
01:24:02,329 --> 01:24:10,319
Miltan had his mic on and the camera setup was maybe 20 feet away from that blue bedroom.

1915
01:24:10,319 --> 01:24:13,319
And it was a direct feed from a camera into that TV.

1916
01:24:13,319 --> 01:24:16,319
And the TV audio was on.

1917
01:24:16,319 --> 01:24:20,319
So the audio was coming from Miltan's mic and the mic in that camera out of the TV into

1918
01:24:20,319 --> 01:24:21,319
German's mic.

1919
01:24:21,319 --> 01:24:25,750
So it created this like weird echo effect that kind of worked for the scene.

1920
01:24:25,750 --> 01:24:30,399
It was sort of a happy accident how that worked out.

1921
01:24:30,399 --> 01:24:32,960
That was, by the way, that segment there.

1922
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:37,960
That was done within like overnight after the second stream.

1923
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:41,960
We were talking about like, oh yeah, we could maybe have the TV there.

1924
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:42,960
That might be funny.

1925
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:46,960
They set up this entire like back studio back where the furniture is.

1926
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:48,960
They did it in like four hours.

1927
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:49,960
It was like, what the fuck?

1928
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:50,960
It's here?

1929
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:53,960
It's already done this like elaborate thing back here.

1930
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:56,960
How did you guys even remotely do that in less than like three, four hours?

1931
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:57,960
That was Bobby.

1932
01:24:57,960 --> 01:24:58,960
That's Bobby.

1933
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:00,779
That's old Bobby.

1934
01:25:00,779 --> 01:25:01,779
Jerma asked and we delivered.

1935
01:25:01,779 --> 01:25:02,779
Do you have any pictures?

1936
01:25:02,779 --> 01:25:07,170
Do you have any pictures of like of that?

1937
01:25:07,170 --> 01:25:11,170
It was kind of funny to me because I kept going to Jake and I was like, Jake, I'm just

1938
01:25:11,170 --> 01:25:12,170
not happy with this setup.

1939
01:25:12,170 --> 01:25:14,170
It doesn't look the way I want it to look.

1940
01:25:14,170 --> 01:25:17,170
And then Jerma comes in and he's like, this is amazing.

1941
01:25:17,170 --> 01:25:19,170
And I was like, all right, I guess I'm done here.

1942
01:25:19,170 --> 01:25:20,170
And we went with it.

1943
01:25:20,170 --> 01:25:21,170
So it ended up working.

1944
01:25:21,170 --> 01:25:22,170
It was.

1945
01:25:22,170 --> 01:25:24,430
It was insane.

1946
01:25:24,430 --> 01:25:25,430
I don't know if this is going to work.

1947
01:25:25,430 --> 01:25:26,430
We're going to try it.

1948
01:25:26,430 --> 01:25:27,859
Hang on.

1949
01:25:27,859 --> 01:25:29,359
Let me.

1950
01:25:29,359 --> 01:25:30,359
What are we?

1951
01:25:30,359 --> 01:25:31,359
Yeah.

1952
01:25:31,359 --> 01:25:32,359
That's the setup.

1953
01:25:32,359 --> 01:25:33,359
See if it'll focus.

1954
01:25:33,359 --> 01:25:35,619
Come on.

1955
01:25:35,619 --> 01:25:38,619
I need to probably get my face out of it.

1956
01:25:38,619 --> 01:25:40,300
Well, you get the idea.

1957
01:25:40,300 --> 01:25:44,260
There's like a stage, set up little stage under that deck and a camera.

1958
01:25:44,260 --> 01:25:47,619
And so it would look every the video was piped from there onto the TV in that one room.

1959
01:25:47,619 --> 01:25:49,619
So it would look like it was a live.

1960
01:25:49,619 --> 01:25:50,619
Yeah.

1961
01:25:50,619 --> 01:25:53,819
And one of the, one of the things I definitely wanted to put back there was a monitor so

1962
01:25:53,819 --> 01:25:57,340
they could see themselves and frame themselves appropriately so that they could see what

1963
01:25:57,340 --> 01:25:59,100
they're going to look like on the TV.

1964
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:02,100
And without that, that whole Ted scene would have like, you know, they wouldn't have been

1965
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:04,300
able to see like where they were and whatnot.

1966
01:26:04,300 --> 01:26:07,180
So it ended up working out really nicely.

1967
01:26:07,180 --> 01:26:09,180
And this picture, you can see Mark's perspective better too.

1968
01:26:09,180 --> 01:26:11,819
He was talking about what he can see and not see for the sound effects.

1969
01:26:11,819 --> 01:26:13,300
This is the picture from his station.

1970
01:26:13,300 --> 01:26:20,500
And I was like, my focus was back and forth between that launch pad with all those buttons

1971
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:24,689
with the sound effects and the faders as people were coming and going.

1972
01:26:24,689 --> 01:26:29,939
Because I'd say probably 90 to 95 percent of that entire thing was improv.

1973
01:26:29,979 --> 01:26:33,260
So like normally with theater, you have a script you can follow as characters come and

1974
01:26:33,260 --> 01:26:35,659
go and sound effects cues.

1975
01:26:35,659 --> 01:26:39,220
This was all happening in real time with no script.

1976
01:26:39,220 --> 01:26:44,800
So it was a lot of reactivity and doing things as they happened.

1977
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:45,800
Mics were getting passed around.

1978
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:46,800
I didn't know who had what mic.

1979
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:51,760
Josh, the stage manager, did a fantastic job of saying, you know, this mic is coming out

1980
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:52,760
on this character.

1981
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:53,760
Big shout out to Josh.

1982
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:56,279
Trying to keep us in the loop.

1983
01:26:56,279 --> 01:26:57,279
Yeah.

1984
01:26:57,279 --> 01:26:58,779
Yeah, Josh totally killed it.

1985
01:26:58,779 --> 01:27:01,180
And not only were you having to worry about everybody's microphones and we had everybody

1986
01:27:01,180 --> 01:27:05,960
mic'd up in different rooms as shotguns, but you're pumping sound effects through.

1987
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:07,319
So you have to worry about that.

1988
01:27:07,319 --> 01:27:08,319
You have to worry about the sounds.

1989
01:27:08,319 --> 01:27:11,439
You have to worry about when to put a fart in because it's incredibly important.

1990
01:27:11,439 --> 01:27:15,739
When to put in the real guy or radio sounds.

1991
01:27:15,739 --> 01:27:16,739
That's a lot to do.

1992
01:27:16,739 --> 01:27:20,380
Also, he's also he's also got a com headset on.

1993
01:27:20,380 --> 01:27:25,020
So he's really mixing in one year with like what was it ended up being like eight, nine,

1994
01:27:25,020 --> 01:27:26,260
ten mics.

1995
01:27:26,260 --> 01:27:28,819
So plus, you know, six more shotguns.

1996
01:27:28,819 --> 01:27:33,220
So it's really impressive what Mark was able to do with the front house situation.

1997
01:27:33,220 --> 01:27:34,970
Yeah, I remember that.

1998
01:27:34,970 --> 01:27:38,409
And there was a little bit of an audio discrepancy between what I heard in my board and what

1999
01:27:38,409 --> 01:27:39,409
actually went out over the air.

2000
01:27:39,409 --> 01:27:43,859
Like some of the mics were a little bit louder over the air than they were in my ear.

2001
01:27:43,859 --> 01:27:48,100
And I have some gain issues to work out between because the video and audio passed through

2002
01:27:48,100 --> 01:27:52,390
like eight different pieces of equipment before it went out to Twitch.

2003
01:27:52,390 --> 01:27:53,390
This is kind of crazy.

2004
01:27:53,390 --> 01:27:54,630
That's crazy.

2005
01:27:54,630 --> 01:27:55,630
Yeah, it was.

2006
01:27:55,630 --> 01:27:56,989
It was a lot of fun.

2007
01:27:56,989 --> 01:27:57,989
I've got to.

2008
01:27:57,989 --> 01:27:59,420
Oh, go ahead.

2009
01:27:59,539 --> 01:28:05,100
On the so after we wrapped the second show and we knew the party was coming, I remember

2010
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:10,060
like talking to Mark and we kind of had I think we were like driving home to the hotel

2011
01:28:10,060 --> 01:28:12,319
and we were like, so you're ready for that party?

2012
01:28:12,319 --> 01:28:18,199
And he's just like, haha, like we were aware of the amount of people that we had to focus

2013
01:28:18,199 --> 01:28:20,640
on all with their own mics that you had to like cut between.

2014
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:25,739
I think it turned out amazing with, you know, what sort of information and all the and Bobby

2015
01:28:25,739 --> 01:28:30,439
for cutting between all those different shots in the party, like being able to see the cutaways

2016
01:28:30,439 --> 01:28:34,600
of like Edna in the pool or the Grim Reaper and the clown talking in the corner and like

2017
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:39,880
have it all feel like a vibrant living, you know, party scene was fantastic to watch.

2018
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:41,859
Well, also trying to keep the story coherent.

2019
01:28:41,859 --> 01:28:46,840
And that's where like Bobby and Alex and everybody were fantastic at saying, OK, let's we got

2020
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:49,399
to listen to what Ludwig and Randy are saying right now.

2021
01:28:49,399 --> 01:28:52,789
So make sure their mics are hot.

2022
01:28:52,789 --> 01:28:57,029
So it was a everybody on the team just kind of came together and having that communication,

2023
01:28:57,029 --> 01:29:03,399
having those headsets was key to keeping everything focused and where it needed to be.

2024
01:29:03,399 --> 01:29:06,970
Yeah, to jump on what it was a little bit of a logistic hell.

2025
01:29:06,970 --> 01:29:11,170
Yeah. Yeah. After the fire scene, I felt like it was kind of chaotic because the fire took

2026
01:29:11,170 --> 01:29:14,569
place in pretty much all three rooms plus the front yard.

2027
01:29:14,569 --> 01:29:18,449
And then the fire was happening and then the other guys were still playing with their fire,

2028
01:29:18,449 --> 01:29:21,729
doing their little gags in the other room and tosses Jerma out.

2029
01:29:21,729 --> 01:29:24,369
There's a thumbs up shot that we got that turned out to be great.

2030
01:29:24,369 --> 01:29:28,649
And then the next day I was like, OK, there's going to be 20 more people in the house.

2031
01:29:28,649 --> 01:29:31,979
Like, this is going to get crazy, but it ended up working out great.

2032
01:29:31,979 --> 01:29:37,180
And just the communication for everybody on headsets was just super key to making this show successful.

2033
01:29:37,180 --> 01:29:39,300
So I want to show this clip real quick.

2034
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:44,539
This is this is the party scene and tables perspective from the tables perspective.

2035
01:29:44,539 --> 01:29:46,380
So you're not going to hear the crew audio over the comms.

2036
01:29:46,380 --> 01:30:02,779
You're just going to hear what it sounds like in that room because I think it's a pretty unique perspective.

2037
01:30:02,779 --> 01:30:07,500
That's wild to look at from this perspective after it's all over.

2038
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:19,640
Lights look totally different, too.

2039
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:21,960
And I got to give a lot of props to the camera guys that we had.

2040
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:25,600
They were really selling the, you know, the main action as this whole party was going on

2041
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:28,159
between the two wireless operators.

2042
01:30:28,159 --> 01:30:31,319
So we really didn't miss any of the little small gags here and there.

2043
01:30:31,319 --> 01:30:37,399
I'm sure there's a couple we missed, but there's a lot going on at one time in six different rooms.

2044
01:30:37,399 --> 01:30:42,079
Also, don't forget, any time that Edna appears, the other fun part for camera and for audio

2045
01:30:42,079 --> 01:30:48,159
is that people can't get near Kit with that microphone because then you hear the Edna voice on.

2046
01:30:48,159 --> 01:30:55,000
So when chat would vote for you guys voted at one point to have Jeremy dance with Edna, I believe.

2047
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:59,640
That's really hard to actually pull off for us because they can't talk when they're dancing easily

2048
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:03,359
because you would hear Edna's voice amplified with Jeremy's voice.

2049
01:31:03,359 --> 01:31:08,960
Right. So there's all these little pieces where a simple decision causes four other things for us to watch.

2050
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:11,479
I think there was a few times when I actually came through.

2051
01:31:11,479 --> 01:31:17,079
I came through Kit's mic a few times and it was just like, it sounded insane.

2052
01:31:17,079 --> 01:31:23,579
So I tried to kind of like, like, like, like, like try to react to like just my face was so hard to do.

2053
01:31:23,579 --> 01:31:26,539
This was so great. That's an insane picture.

2054
01:31:26,539 --> 01:31:31,979
I love that. For that piece, the Edna thing, I think typically when Kit's using that mic,

2055
01:31:31,979 --> 01:31:36,140
it's, you know, a streamer mic, a mic that's really, you know, he's the only one in the room also.

2056
01:31:36,140 --> 01:31:40,260
So like when you put it onto a lapel and put that effect through it, you never know what you're going to get.

2057
01:31:40,260 --> 01:31:42,500
And so as he moved around, his voice level changes.

2058
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:46,140
So you can kind of hear the level of Edna change throughout the scene.

2059
01:31:46,140 --> 01:31:49,659
But Mark did a really good job of riding that fader and riding those effects.

2060
01:31:49,659 --> 01:31:53,510
So shouts out to Mark on that.

2061
01:31:53,510 --> 01:31:55,350
So we're trying to get Ludwig connected right now.

2062
01:31:55,350 --> 01:31:57,869
He's having a little issue, but we're getting him sorted.

2063
01:31:57,869 --> 01:32:04,909
So in the meantime, I want to play one more crew audio clip because it seems like chat really likes those.

2064
01:32:04,909 --> 01:32:07,970
So we'll play another one that says album cover.

2065
01:32:07,970 --> 01:32:11,329
Oh, speaking of album covers, I have an exciting announcement.

2066
01:32:11,329 --> 01:32:14,829
I don't even think Jeremy knows this.

2067
01:32:14,829 --> 01:32:15,630
What is it?

2068
01:32:15,630 --> 01:32:17,989
We submitted it today.

2069
01:32:17,989 --> 01:32:25,819
And in about seven days time, you should be able to listen to the bi-mode soundtrack on Spotify.

2070
01:32:25,819 --> 01:32:28,380
Oh, yeah.

2071
01:32:28,380 --> 01:32:29,060
Nice.

2072
01:32:29,060 --> 01:32:30,539
So, yeah, that's original music.

2073
01:32:30,539 --> 01:32:32,579
People may not realize that.

2074
01:32:32,579 --> 01:32:37,380
Yeah, people probably don't really address myself to that every day.

2075
01:32:37,380 --> 01:32:41,939
The amount of times we heard that on set and while live is staggering.

2076
01:32:41,939 --> 01:32:44,460
I have to imagine people are playing it, too.

2077
01:32:44,460 --> 01:32:47,539
Yeah, it's like being at a ride at Disney, right?

2078
01:32:47,539 --> 01:32:51,300
They play like the same like two minute audio clip of like, it's you.

2079
01:32:51,300 --> 01:32:53,420
Oh, welcome. We need to get you into that seat.

2080
01:32:53,420 --> 01:32:55,340
You're going to fight the rebels.

2081
01:32:55,340 --> 01:32:58,060
Right. It just plays all day.

2082
01:32:58,060 --> 01:33:00,579
Yeah, people are asking about DMC.

2083
01:33:00,579 --> 01:33:03,819
Yeah, that piece was commissioned for this stream.

2084
01:33:03,819 --> 01:33:12,390
All of the rest of the music that was used was royalty free music that is licensed through various regular royalty free sort of sites.

2085
01:33:12,390 --> 01:33:21,390
But the main piece that's used during the bi-mode, that's used during the character selector, that's used during the loading screen, that piece was made custom for us.

2086
01:33:21,390 --> 01:33:26,149
And I don't think we have a single really good piece in any of the pods because it was all like either custom or otherwise.

2087
01:33:26,149 --> 01:33:27,390
So that's why you get to see the whole thing.

2088
01:33:27,390 --> 01:33:29,149
That is remarkable.

2089
01:33:29,149 --> 01:33:33,109
Considering how many sound effects and little audio files were played, that's remarkable.

2090
01:33:33,750 --> 01:33:35,069
Jake gave me a week to find those.

2091
01:33:35,069 --> 01:33:37,710
He was like, hey, we have a week. Find a bunch of sound effects and music.

2092
01:33:37,710 --> 01:33:40,659
We have like 12 hours of stream to kill. Find some music.

2093
01:33:40,659 --> 01:33:44,189
OK, good luck.

2094
01:33:44,189 --> 01:33:46,829
Yeah. Was there one other?

2095
01:33:46,829 --> 01:33:49,189
Yeah, so we're going to go ahead and play this scene.

2096
01:33:49,189 --> 01:33:51,619
I love this scene.

2097
01:33:51,619 --> 01:33:56,819
Lawyers. This is this is one of one of Jeremy's birth child scene.

2098
01:33:56,819 --> 01:34:00,340
So, yeah, we talked about the scenes that were sort of set up ahead of time.

2099
01:34:00,340 --> 01:34:05,180
The DIY room, obviously, was something that we needed all the props in place for it to happen.

2100
01:34:05,180 --> 01:34:14,300
In terms of how it happened was totally up to chat how those walls got painted, whether or not he actually discovered the safe was was up to you as well.

2101
01:34:14,300 --> 01:34:17,500
But in the end, that wall comes down, he finds a safe and inside the safe is the money.

2102
01:34:17,500 --> 01:34:25,140
And we needed an army of lawyers ready to make that happen because his concept was, you know, he calls one lawyer to settle it.

2103
01:34:25,140 --> 01:34:27,779
And then that lawyer calls another lawyer and that lawyer doesn't know what to do.

2104
01:34:27,779 --> 01:34:31,979
So he calls another lawyer, et cetera, et cetera. So that's how that that wound up.

2105
01:34:32,020 --> 01:34:38,100
There was an alternate storyline, too, I think, where it and and Jeremy got married.

2106
01:34:38,100 --> 01:34:42,899
And so we would have called the priest to have them get married in the middle of that scene, but that didn't wind up panning out.

2107
01:34:42,899 --> 01:34:51,060
So anyway, I'll play back what you saw on stream and along with the crew audio to add to this, too, add to this, too, just this is important.

2108
01:34:51,060 --> 01:34:59,939
So when when the call the bear, all the bear, I opened up this this door here that you see of that to the kitchen.

2109
01:34:59,939 --> 01:35:03,390
And there's just a guy with a bear head.

2110
01:35:03,430 --> 01:35:05,369
He wasn't in the whole costume.

2111
01:35:05,369 --> 01:35:07,210
So I'm just like, how the fuck are we going to get him in here?

2112
01:35:07,210 --> 01:35:09,050
It's just as he just has his head on.

2113
01:35:09,050 --> 01:35:13,729
So he's like he was he was essentially they weren't prepared for that at all.

2114
01:35:13,729 --> 01:35:19,409
So I was imagining he might have like come into the house and started like attacking people.

2115
01:35:19,409 --> 01:35:22,130
But it's just him with the head. He scared the shit out of me.

2116
01:35:22,130 --> 01:35:26,090
He's literally just sitting in the in the in the little little cubby here.

2117
01:35:26,090 --> 01:35:31,170
And I was like, what the? Yeah, I want to say that fancy bear.

2118
01:35:31,170 --> 01:35:33,329
Yeah, it was just a very old fancy bear.

2119
01:35:33,329 --> 01:35:39,449
We so Jeremy didn't know that was going to happen because originally this was meant to play out and the bear thing wasn't an option.

2120
01:35:39,449 --> 01:35:47,329
But as we're we're running all the polls and running the stream on our side, on the extension side, we see Chad just blowing up with call bear.

2121
01:35:47,329 --> 01:35:49,329
Like they're they're sick of these lawyers.

2122
01:35:49,329 --> 01:35:53,890
They need like a stabilizing, violent force to like, you know, return normalcy.

2123
01:35:53,890 --> 01:35:58,010
So they just wanted the bear in because we already showed them that you can call bear for the gorilla.

2124
01:35:58,010 --> 01:36:00,569
So they know it's an option. They know that they can call bear.

2125
01:36:00,609 --> 01:36:07,609
And so we're like, you have to we have to call bear like I can give me five seconds.

2126
01:36:07,609 --> 01:36:10,770
OK, it could just be that I'm going to I'm going to back it up.

2127
01:36:10,770 --> 01:36:14,449
The beginning call of this is is do we have the bear ready?

2128
01:36:14,449 --> 01:36:20,489
And the bear costume change is the hardest costume change of all because it takes almost 15 minutes to get in the costume.

2129
01:36:20,489 --> 01:36:23,850
It's ridiculous. And so, of course, the bear is not ready.

2130
01:36:23,850 --> 01:36:27,289
So here's the call. And Josh is desperately going, fuck you guys.

2131
01:36:28,050 --> 01:36:34,350
We want us to call the bear. Is there any way we can get a bear just to peek in?

2132
01:36:34,350 --> 01:36:37,750
I can give me five seconds.

2133
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:41,159
It could even just be the head, right?

2134
01:36:41,159 --> 01:36:44,399
Yeah, tell him to go in between the rooms and peek out the window or something.

2135
01:36:44,399 --> 01:36:47,800
Yeah, just walk by and be like, you know, the amount of times Bobby says five seconds.

2136
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:53,079
Yeah, we can do that. All right, get him ready.

2137
01:36:53,079 --> 01:36:56,000
I need 20 seconds. What window do you want?

2138
01:36:56,119 --> 01:36:59,039
We're going to run the pool now.

2139
01:36:59,039 --> 01:37:00,720
Into the kitchen.

2140
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:01,720
Into the kitchen.

2141
01:37:01,720 --> 01:37:03,119
Not yet. Not yet.

2142
01:37:03,119 --> 01:37:04,319
Oh, I got it.

2143
01:37:04,319 --> 01:37:05,439
Ready, nine, take nine.

2144
01:37:05,439 --> 01:37:07,680
This is going to be tight with the bear.

2145
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:08,680
All right, take your time.

2146
01:37:08,680 --> 01:37:09,479
I'll let you know when you're good.

2147
01:37:09,479 --> 01:37:12,000
Bear coming into the window, nine, be ready.

2148
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,439
Not yet. Do not bring them yet.

2149
01:37:14,439 --> 01:37:16,720
We're not going to go in yet. We're just making sure we can fit.

2150
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:18,039
OK, he's going to call now.

2151
01:37:18,039 --> 01:37:19,920
Viewers voted for him to call bear. Let him know.

2152
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:20,880
OK, I can't see.

2153
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:22,319
Yeah, by the way, there was a huge concern.

2154
01:37:22,319 --> 01:37:25,840
That bear head is so big, we didn't think it would fit between the walls.

2155
01:37:25,880 --> 01:37:27,760
Like for him to stick his head through the window.

2156
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:28,680
So that's what that call was.

2157
01:37:28,680 --> 01:37:29,760
Which would have been hilarious.

2158
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:34,260
If he had gotten stuck in there,

2159
01:37:34,260 --> 01:37:36,260
it would have been worth turning the camera and just showing it.

2160
01:37:36,260 --> 01:37:37,539
Like if he actually got stuck there.

2161
01:37:37,539 --> 01:37:38,699
You're here to monitor, so I just...

2162
01:37:38,699 --> 01:37:40,699
Bring Jed. Go on the bear.

2163
01:37:40,699 --> 01:37:41,859
No, do not go on the bear.

2164
01:37:41,859 --> 01:37:43,539
Do not go on the bear. He's the parter.

2165
01:37:43,539 --> 01:37:45,100
Take ten, take ten.

2166
01:37:45,100 --> 01:37:46,779
All right, send bear now.

2167
01:37:46,779 --> 01:37:49,819
Take ten. Ten's up, ready eight.

2168
01:37:49,819 --> 01:37:51,539
Ready eleven, take eleven.

2169
01:37:51,539 --> 01:37:52,380
He just paid seven grand.

2170
01:37:52,380 --> 01:37:57,380
Ready ten, take ten.

2171
01:37:57,380 --> 01:37:58,460
Where's the bear coming to again?

2172
01:37:58,460 --> 01:37:59,779
He's through the window in four.

2173
01:37:59,779 --> 01:38:02,500
All right, ready thirteen, take thirteen.

2174
01:38:02,500 --> 01:38:03,380
Bear noises.

2175
01:38:03,380 --> 01:38:04,579
Ready eight, take eight.

2176
01:38:04,579 --> 01:38:05,380
I don't think so.

2177
01:38:05,380 --> 01:38:06,579
I think it's just his head.

2178
01:38:06,579 --> 01:38:07,939
It's not his head, it's his head only.

2179
01:38:07,939 --> 01:38:11,010
It's his head only, Blair.

2180
01:38:11,010 --> 01:38:13,140
He can't come inside.

2181
01:38:13,140 --> 01:38:15,739
Ready eight, take eight.

2182
01:38:15,739 --> 01:38:17,180
Can we get the bear to poke through one more time?

2183
01:38:17,180 --> 01:38:19,979
Ready ten, take ten.

2184
01:38:19,979 --> 01:38:22,579
Yeah, I need fifteen seconds.

2185
01:38:22,579 --> 01:38:23,340
Yep.

2186
01:38:23,340 --> 01:38:25,140
So much for Josh.

2187
01:38:27,140 --> 01:38:28,180
We really wanted the fist bump.

2188
01:38:28,180 --> 01:38:28,819
Give him a fist bump, camera guy.

2189
01:38:28,819 --> 01:38:29,380
Give him a fist bump.

2190
01:38:29,539 --> 01:38:31,779
He couldn't be, it was his bare hands.

2191
01:38:31,779 --> 01:38:33,420
Give him the fist bump.

2192
01:38:33,420 --> 01:38:35,819
Ready ten, take ten.

2193
01:38:35,819 --> 01:38:36,939
Yeah, but we're just gonna get the camera guy

2194
01:38:36,939 --> 01:38:37,939
to stick his hand through.

2195
01:38:37,939 --> 01:38:39,260
Do we put the fist in the window now?

2196
01:38:39,260 --> 01:38:41,140
Stick the fist, yeah, do it, do it.

2197
01:38:41,140 --> 01:38:42,500
It's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone.

2198
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:44,939
Ready three, take three.

2199
01:38:44,939 --> 01:38:46,539
We were trying to get you a fist somewhere.

2200
01:38:46,539 --> 01:38:50,560
The bear go, ready ten, take ten.

2201
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:53,119
All right, I think that's gonna...

2202
01:38:53,119 --> 01:38:55,960
If it was a human hand, that would've been funny.

2203
01:38:55,960 --> 01:38:57,439
I was trying to tell him, I was like, go now,

2204
01:38:57,479 --> 01:38:59,800
it doesn't matter, send someone, but it's too late.

2205
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:01,279
Well, also, wasn't he dressed...

2206
01:39:01,279 --> 01:39:03,510
Yeah, I was trying to tell our camera operator just...

2207
01:39:03,510 --> 01:39:04,350
Yeah, a little camera operator.

2208
01:39:04,350 --> 01:39:08,029
He had, didn't he have the gladiator costume on?

2209
01:39:08,029 --> 01:39:08,869
Yes.

2210
01:39:08,869 --> 01:39:10,829
Because he was ready to be the gladiator, right?

2211
01:39:10,829 --> 01:39:13,149
So it was this bear head with a gladiator,

2212
01:39:13,149 --> 01:39:14,270
it looked like a Fortnite skin.

2213
01:39:14,270 --> 01:39:16,270
Honestly, I think they should've sent him in anyway.

2214
01:39:16,270 --> 01:39:18,989
I think just a bear in a gladiator outfit

2215
01:39:18,989 --> 01:39:21,069
to defend you against the lawyers

2216
01:39:21,069 --> 01:39:23,310
still would've been a very worthwhile scene,

2217
01:39:23,310 --> 01:39:25,350
but you know, let's just say.

2218
01:39:25,390 --> 01:39:28,739
The real path would've been if the bear was a lawyer.

2219
01:39:28,739 --> 01:39:30,140
Yeah, bear comes in as a lawyer.

2220
01:39:30,140 --> 01:39:32,859
If we needed the standing bear or the scary bear,

2221
01:39:32,859 --> 01:39:35,539
because he claimed it took like 30 seconds longer

2222
01:39:35,539 --> 01:39:37,460
for one or the other, so he just,

2223
01:39:37,460 --> 01:39:38,899
we want standing bear or fancy bear,

2224
01:39:38,899 --> 01:39:40,739
standing bear or fancy bear.

2225
01:39:40,739 --> 01:39:42,539
It was some great calls on com.

2226
01:39:42,539 --> 01:39:43,380
Yeah.

2227
01:39:43,380 --> 01:39:44,819
It's so hard to see out of that suit

2228
01:39:44,819 --> 01:39:46,899
that the first time when the guy that plays that,

2229
01:39:46,899 --> 01:39:48,579
the bear came out to rummage through the trash,

2230
01:39:48,579 --> 01:39:50,939
he left, but he was crawling and he couldn't see,

2231
01:39:50,939 --> 01:39:52,220
and we had to go get him out of the drapes

2232
01:39:52,220 --> 01:39:53,659
because he was crawling through the...

2233
01:39:53,699 --> 01:39:56,140
He was like stuck in the drapes that surround the set

2234
01:39:56,140 --> 01:39:57,300
because he can't see where he is,

2235
01:39:57,300 --> 01:39:58,340
so we had to go get him out

2236
01:39:58,340 --> 01:40:01,140
because he's just in the drapes like lost.

2237
01:40:01,140 --> 01:40:05,319
Do you have any shots from when the bear mauls Kit

2238
01:40:05,319 --> 01:40:08,800
as the car salesman and then tries to leave

2239
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:11,159
and like trips over and like his head starts falling off?

2240
01:40:11,159 --> 01:40:12,560
I think so.

2241
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:15,359
Yeah, so what we're gonna do now is we're gonna,

2242
01:40:15,359 --> 01:40:17,239
we're gonna take another ad break,

2243
01:40:17,239 --> 01:40:19,600
and when we come back, we have both Ludwig and Kit

2244
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:22,760
standing by for the third segment of our show.

2245
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:25,000
Huge shout out to Bobby and Mark.

2246
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:28,399
Thank you so much for joining us.

2247
01:40:28,399 --> 01:40:30,319
Thank you guys for this opportunity,

2248
01:40:30,319 --> 01:40:33,729
super unique and super fun, I appreciate it.

2249
01:40:33,729 --> 01:40:34,569
Awesome.

2250
01:40:34,569 --> 01:40:40,220
So after this break, we'll be back with Kit Boga,

2251
01:40:40,220 --> 01:40:41,340
Ludwig and Kraikin.

2252
01:40:41,340 --> 01:44:31,810
So thanks everybody.

2253
01:44:36,350 --> 01:44:38,470
It's me, Fred!

2254
01:44:38,470 --> 01:44:40,779
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

2255
01:44:43,260 --> 01:44:44,659
What the fuck was that?

2256
01:44:46,819 --> 01:44:47,659
Didn't like that.

2257
01:44:47,659 --> 01:44:48,479
What?

2258
01:44:48,479 --> 01:44:49,319
We were looking for something.

2259
01:44:49,399 --> 01:44:51,960
You did a Fred reference?

2260
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:57,590
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

2261
01:44:57,590 --> 01:44:59,470
I don't know, we had the leftover helium tank,

2262
01:44:59,470 --> 01:45:03,640
I needed something.

2263
01:45:03,640 --> 01:45:04,479
It was fucked.

2264
01:45:04,479 --> 01:45:05,760
Is my audio good?

2265
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:06,680
Can you guys hear me?

2266
01:45:06,680 --> 01:45:08,199
Your audio's fantastic.

2267
01:45:08,199 --> 01:45:09,039
You sound great.

2268
01:45:09,039 --> 01:45:11,239
Yes. I love that.

2269
01:45:11,239 --> 01:45:12,479
I downloaded VMAX.

2270
01:45:12,479 --> 01:45:13,319
What's going on?

2271
01:45:13,319 --> 01:45:14,600
I have an entire operation in front of me.

2272
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:17,039
I see, I have like seven different overlays.

2273
01:45:18,399 --> 01:45:19,239
But how much?

2274
01:45:19,239 --> 01:45:20,060
I'm doing good.

2275
01:45:20,060 --> 01:45:21,079
This is, this is, this is dope.

2276
01:45:21,079 --> 01:45:25,720
I didn't realize that you producers, you talked.

2277
01:45:25,720 --> 01:45:26,560
Ha ha ha ha!

2278
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:27,560
Like that I have lips?

2279
01:45:28,199 --> 01:45:29,039
The entire time.

2280
01:45:29,039 --> 01:45:29,880
Yeah.

2281
01:45:29,880 --> 01:45:32,140
They were like talking and like directing.

2282
01:45:32,140 --> 01:45:33,659
They were like, they were working.

2283
01:45:33,659 --> 01:45:34,500
I don't know.

2284
01:45:34,500 --> 01:45:35,859
Like a lot.

2285
01:45:35,859 --> 01:45:36,699
It just happened.

2286
01:45:36,699 --> 01:45:37,859
It just happened.

2287
01:45:37,859 --> 01:45:38,699
Yeah.

2288
01:45:38,699 --> 01:45:39,539
We had to talk the whole time.

2289
01:45:39,539 --> 01:45:40,500
I thought it just kind of happened.

2290
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:41,739
I didn't know.

2291
01:45:41,739 --> 01:45:42,579
Crikey.

2292
01:45:42,579 --> 01:45:43,399
My apologies.

2293
01:45:43,399 --> 01:45:44,239
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

2294
01:45:44,239 --> 01:45:45,079
Yeah.

2295
01:45:45,079 --> 01:45:46,300
Well, I'll accept it.

2296
01:45:50,579 --> 01:45:51,539
What are we looking at here?

2297
01:45:51,539 --> 01:45:52,619
What is this?

2298
01:45:52,619 --> 01:45:53,779
Oh, you know, I don't know.

2299
01:45:53,779 --> 01:45:54,619
Good driveway.

2300
01:45:54,619 --> 01:45:55,439
Let's play it.

2301
01:45:55,439 --> 01:45:56,279
Let's see.

2302
01:45:56,279 --> 01:45:59,520
I think this is a load of furniture coming in.

2303
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:07,619
I don't know why this is what's queued up, but.

2304
01:46:07,619 --> 01:46:09,220
It's a random furniture.

2305
01:46:09,220 --> 01:46:11,180
Oh, this is fucking amazing.

2306
01:46:11,180 --> 01:46:12,020
Isn't that great?

2307
01:46:12,020 --> 01:46:12,859
Piece.

2308
01:46:12,859 --> 01:46:15,260
Oh, what a beauty.

2309
01:46:15,260 --> 01:46:16,380
There's Ted's couch.

2310
01:46:17,739 --> 01:46:18,560
There's the bar.

2311
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:19,399
This looks like somebody's moving.

2312
01:46:19,399 --> 01:46:21,939
Ha ha ha ha ha!

2313
01:46:21,939 --> 01:46:24,529
We basically did several times.

2314
01:46:24,529 --> 01:46:25,369
Yeah, there's the bar.

2315
01:46:25,369 --> 01:46:28,970
They put the bar in.

2316
01:46:28,970 --> 01:46:30,890
So, yeah.

2317
01:46:30,890 --> 01:46:32,850
Why don't we start with,

2318
01:46:33,850 --> 01:46:36,890
I want to hear from Kit and from Ludwig

2319
01:46:36,890 --> 01:46:39,369
and from Kraken about what your favorite scenes

2320
01:46:39,369 --> 01:46:42,640
of the show were and why.

2321
01:46:42,640 --> 01:46:45,829
So, let's start with you, Kit.

2322
01:46:45,829 --> 01:46:48,430
Favorite scenes, specifically.

2323
01:46:50,050 --> 01:46:56,229
I loved, although I don't think Jerma did,

2324
01:46:56,430 --> 01:46:58,069
so I feel bad saying this.

2325
01:46:58,069 --> 01:47:02,979
I loved your love scene with death,

2326
01:47:05,880 --> 01:47:09,460
partially because if I remember correctly,

2327
01:47:09,739 --> 01:47:13,500
you specifically said that you didn't really want it

2328
01:47:13,500 --> 01:47:17,619
to go very long and it did go very long.

2329
01:47:17,619 --> 01:47:18,460
I have that clip.

2330
01:47:18,460 --> 01:47:20,899
Let me see if I can find it.

2331
01:47:20,899 --> 01:47:22,659
I just like awkward moments.

2332
01:47:23,659 --> 01:47:25,460
Well, the thing about that scene is they were never supposed,

2333
01:47:25,460 --> 01:47:27,539
they were supposed to cut away.

2334
01:47:27,539 --> 01:47:28,380
Yeah.

2335
01:47:28,380 --> 01:47:29,220
Am I echoing?

2336
01:47:29,220 --> 01:47:30,060
Yeah.

2337
01:47:30,060 --> 01:47:30,880
Is that me echoing?

2338
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:31,960
No, you're good.

2339
01:47:31,960 --> 01:47:33,100
I hear you once.

2340
01:47:33,100 --> 01:47:36,260
You might hear yourself in V-Mix.

2341
01:47:36,260 --> 01:47:38,949
I hear myself twice.

2342
01:47:38,949 --> 01:47:41,270
I hear you four times a second time.

2343
01:47:41,310 --> 01:47:43,500
Everybody has headphones on.

2344
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:45,939
Ever had a stream open somewhere?

2345
01:47:45,939 --> 01:47:48,180
Wait, it might be me.

2346
01:47:48,180 --> 01:47:50,329
Hold on, is it resolved?

2347
01:47:50,329 --> 01:47:51,170
Hello?

2348
01:47:51,170 --> 01:47:52,180
Hello, yes.

2349
01:47:52,180 --> 01:47:53,500
Yes.

2350
01:47:53,500 --> 01:47:54,819
It was me!

2351
01:47:54,819 --> 01:47:55,659
Yay!

2352
01:47:55,659 --> 01:47:58,359
I was like, do I have a stream open?

2353
01:47:58,359 --> 01:47:59,680
I like to throw in tech issues.

2354
01:47:59,680 --> 01:48:01,760
I like to throw in some tech issues so I can solve them

2355
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:03,279
and then I can be a hero.

2356
01:48:03,279 --> 01:48:04,119
Yeah.

2357
01:48:05,279 --> 01:48:08,439
So here's the moment, Kit, when we discuss that.

2358
01:48:09,819 --> 01:48:10,979
You want to be under the sheets

2359
01:48:10,979 --> 01:48:13,619
or already up and adjusting your clothes?

2360
01:48:14,300 --> 01:48:16,140
Nice.

2361
01:48:16,140 --> 01:48:20,500
I was imagining being already up

2362
01:48:22,340 --> 01:48:25,859
and in the room, not adjusting your covers.

2363
01:48:25,859 --> 01:48:27,140
Wow, that was exciting.

2364
01:48:28,699 --> 01:48:30,859
Wow, I've never experienced that before.

2365
01:48:33,699 --> 01:48:35,699
I almost died like six times.

2366
01:48:37,699 --> 01:48:38,539
That was weird.

2367
01:48:38,539 --> 01:48:41,180
Did you start smoking it?

2368
01:48:41,260 --> 01:48:43,060
I'm still tired of you shooting at me.

2369
01:48:43,060 --> 01:48:46,579
I'm still smoking after I got back from the bathroom.

2370
01:48:46,579 --> 01:48:49,100
What if they put a blur on the,

2371
01:48:49,100 --> 01:48:50,859
kind of pulling around a little?

2372
01:48:50,859 --> 01:48:51,779
That makes it too real.

2373
01:48:51,779 --> 01:48:53,619
Yeah, that might be too much.

2374
01:48:53,619 --> 01:48:54,460
That's too much.

2375
01:48:54,460 --> 01:48:56,300
Yeah, I think the idea was to shoot away from it

2376
01:48:56,300 --> 01:48:57,899
and then just play the music, which I think is fine.

2377
01:48:57,899 --> 01:49:00,260
And Amelia showing up is a great reason to cut away.

2378
01:49:00,260 --> 01:49:01,100
Yeah.

2379
01:49:01,100 --> 01:49:01,939
Yeah, so.

2380
01:49:01,939 --> 01:49:02,779
Yeah, we cut away to ending the house.

2381
01:49:02,779 --> 01:49:03,619
What are you doing?

2382
01:49:03,619 --> 01:49:04,460
What is this?

2383
01:49:04,460 --> 01:49:05,979
What's going on here?

2384
01:49:05,979 --> 01:49:07,859
First you stand me up, then you get a new house,

2385
01:49:07,859 --> 01:49:08,699
and now?

2386
01:49:09,659 --> 01:49:11,340
I'd be like, wouldn't you?

2387
01:49:11,340 --> 01:49:12,699
Like, what, you got a chance here?

2388
01:49:12,699 --> 01:49:14,899
I'd be like, this guy, death?

2389
01:49:14,899 --> 01:49:15,739
You would take it.

2390
01:49:21,819 --> 01:49:23,260
I'll just walk out and be like, don't call me,

2391
01:49:23,260 --> 01:49:24,100
I'll call you.

2392
01:49:35,100 --> 01:49:36,979
So they didn't cut away.

2393
01:49:36,979 --> 01:49:38,819
Yeah, I stayed under the covers.

2394
01:49:38,859 --> 01:49:42,100
In fact, it was like, I was in my ear, I'm hearing,

2395
01:49:42,100 --> 01:49:44,180
hey, we didn't cut away, you gotta stay under the covers.

2396
01:49:44,180 --> 01:49:47,699
And I'm just like, you cut away, you play the music.

2397
01:49:47,699 --> 01:49:49,659
You cut away and you play the music.

2398
01:49:49,659 --> 01:49:50,500
Like that, and they're like,

2399
01:49:50,500 --> 01:49:52,579
just don't use it, we don't have it ready.

2400
01:49:52,579 --> 01:49:55,300
So I think you got up a few times too,

2401
01:49:55,300 --> 01:49:56,380
cause you didn't wanna be in there.

2402
01:49:56,380 --> 01:49:59,180
They're like, go back to the bed, go back to the bed.

2403
01:49:59,180 --> 01:50:01,739
Or you have to go back, cause you're staying at the door.

2404
01:50:01,739 --> 01:50:03,020
There wasn't a good moment to cut away

2405
01:50:03,020 --> 01:50:05,460
cause you guys were just laying on top of like,

2406
01:50:05,460 --> 01:50:06,939
you're standing like, laying like this,

2407
01:50:06,939 --> 01:50:08,899
looking at the ceiling without interacting at all.

2408
01:50:08,899 --> 01:50:10,180
There was no covers involved.

2409
01:50:10,180 --> 01:50:12,140
It's just the most awkward, like sitting,

2410
01:50:12,140 --> 01:50:13,460
like lying side by side.

2411
01:50:13,460 --> 01:50:16,899
And then we're like, when are we supposed to cut away?

2412
01:50:16,899 --> 01:50:19,340
Well, cause it was a small bed too, wasn't it?

2413
01:50:19,340 --> 01:50:20,859
It was like a full, right?

2414
01:50:20,859 --> 01:50:22,220
Or like a twin?

2415
01:50:22,220 --> 01:50:23,060
It was a queen.

2416
01:50:23,060 --> 01:50:24,380
It was like a little bed.

2417
01:50:24,380 --> 01:50:25,220
Was it a queen?

2418
01:50:25,220 --> 01:50:26,060
It didn't feel like it.

2419
01:50:26,060 --> 01:50:26,899
It was a queen.

2420
01:50:26,899 --> 01:50:30,020
It was just like, it felt like a full, I will say.

2421
01:50:30,020 --> 01:50:31,659
I have a confession to make.

2422
01:50:31,659 --> 01:50:33,979
I'm making this confession live on air.

2423
01:50:33,979 --> 01:50:35,460
I have not told anybody this.

2424
01:50:36,460 --> 01:50:41,720
Milton and I conspired to not cut away.

2425
01:50:41,720 --> 01:50:44,119
We talked about it beforehand.

2426
01:50:44,119 --> 01:50:45,439
He was like, so do you, like,

2427
01:50:45,439 --> 01:50:47,479
do you want me to like get under the covers and move around

2428
01:50:47,479 --> 01:50:48,760
or like, are you just going to cut right away?

2429
01:50:48,760 --> 01:50:49,600
And I'm like, no, no, no.

2430
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:50,880
I'm like, get down there.

2431
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:52,520
Like, like pull them down there if you have to.

2432
01:50:52,520 --> 01:50:54,319
Like, you know, make it, you know, make it.

2433
01:50:54,319 --> 01:50:56,039
I don't think I want that.

2434
01:50:56,039 --> 01:50:59,560
The original idea was like, I'm under there with them.

2435
01:50:59,560 --> 01:51:00,960
And like, oh, this is great.

2436
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:01,920
This is fantastic.

2437
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:05,560
Oh yeah, me and death sharing a woo-hoo, right?

2438
01:51:05,560 --> 01:51:07,760
But I, I was under the impression that like,

2439
01:51:07,760 --> 01:51:11,680
I would hear like love, fun, like music, right?

2440
01:51:11,680 --> 01:51:12,960
And they would cut away.

2441
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:14,880
So I'm just sitting there going like, this is great.

2442
01:51:14,880 --> 01:51:15,720
This is awesome.

2443
01:51:15,720 --> 01:51:17,000
I love lying here with death.

2444
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,569
And it's like, cut the fucking camera.

2445
01:51:19,569 --> 01:51:21,010
Like, why is it still in the room?

2446
01:51:21,010 --> 01:51:22,689
Because I had a program monitor.

2447
01:51:22,689 --> 01:51:23,529
I'm sitting there looking over.

2448
01:51:23,529 --> 01:51:27,020
I'm like, why, why are we, why, why are we still here?

2449
01:51:27,020 --> 01:51:28,060
I want you to cut away.

2450
01:51:28,060 --> 01:51:28,899
I mean, the problem is-

2451
01:51:28,899 --> 01:51:29,819
I just got up and I was like, all right, fuck this.

2452
01:51:29,819 --> 01:51:30,659
I'm out of here.

2453
01:51:30,659 --> 01:51:32,380
We had to watch Amelia walk through the whole house,

2454
01:51:32,380 --> 01:51:35,300
which I mean, that takes like 35, 40 seconds, you know?

2455
01:51:35,619 --> 01:51:36,619
We're just going to watch.

2456
01:51:36,619 --> 01:51:37,460
We're just going to-

2457
01:51:37,460 --> 01:51:42,460
Well, because we can't show me woo-hooing somebody on stream.

2458
01:51:43,500 --> 01:51:47,619
That was my main problem was like, I can't like, we can't like,

2459
01:51:47,619 --> 01:51:50,020
we can't like roll around in the bed together

2460
01:51:50,020 --> 01:51:53,880
and like S word on stream.

2461
01:51:53,880 --> 01:51:54,960
We can't do that.

2462
01:51:54,960 --> 01:51:57,699
That was the whole point of the cut.

2463
01:51:57,699 --> 01:52:00,260
By the way, your usage of the S word the next day

2464
01:52:00,260 --> 01:52:05,260
when streaming, I think was just, none of us expected it.

2465
01:52:05,260 --> 01:52:06,500
That was up there in my favorite moments.

2466
01:52:07,539 --> 01:52:09,539
Cause we were, all the production team was listening

2467
01:52:09,539 --> 01:52:11,060
and we're all cutting normally.

2468
01:52:11,060 --> 01:52:12,819
And then you started doing that bit.

2469
01:52:12,819 --> 01:52:13,779
And I forget who it was.

2470
01:52:13,779 --> 01:52:16,130
One of us was like, did you just say sex?

2471
01:52:16,130 --> 01:52:18,859
And we're like, oh, and then we're like, all right,

2472
01:52:18,859 --> 01:52:19,699
lean into it, lean into it, play into it.

2473
01:52:19,699 --> 01:52:23,899
So we like did like alerts, like, like you did what with death?

2474
01:52:23,899 --> 01:52:26,420
And your face went like beat red instantly

2475
01:52:26,420 --> 01:52:29,420
and you like realized what you did and tried to backtrack.

2476
01:52:30,979 --> 01:52:32,579
I was surprised constantly, Jerma,

2477
01:52:32,579 --> 01:52:35,979
that I've been on Twitch a much shorter amount of time,

2478
01:52:35,979 --> 01:52:39,579
but I have lost all sense of pride and shame

2479
01:52:39,579 --> 01:52:44,579
and love for self-respect and I had learned

2480
01:52:45,420 --> 01:52:47,979
that you still have many of those important qualities

2481
01:52:47,979 --> 01:52:52,149
that humans have that hadn't been stripped away yet.

2482
01:52:52,149 --> 01:52:54,149
Well, I was just for terms of service.

2483
01:52:54,149 --> 01:52:57,430
I didn't want to like, fuck death on camera.

2484
01:52:57,430 --> 01:52:58,270
You know what I mean?

2485
01:52:58,270 --> 01:52:59,750
Like, oh yeah, let's like, yeah, this is great.

2486
01:52:59,750 --> 01:53:01,789
We're going to have sex on camera.

2487
01:53:01,789 --> 01:53:04,859
I was, that's why I was afraid of it.

2488
01:53:04,859 --> 01:53:07,350
All right, Ludwig, full story.

2489
01:53:07,350 --> 01:53:12,119
Why don't you tell us about your favorite moment on stream?

2490
01:53:12,119 --> 01:53:14,520
On stream or specifically?

2491
01:53:14,520 --> 01:53:16,619
No, just of the show, I guess.

2492
01:53:16,619 --> 01:53:19,140
Okay, because I think the best moments

2493
01:53:19,140 --> 01:53:21,220
were like sitting in the room

2494
01:53:21,220 --> 01:53:24,729
and then just vamping on funny things that could happen,

2495
01:53:24,729 --> 01:53:27,460
half of which never came to fruition.

2496
01:53:27,460 --> 01:53:29,659
But it felt like being in class with none of the work

2497
01:53:29,659 --> 01:53:30,939
where you could just say shit out loud

2498
01:53:30,939 --> 01:53:33,220
and then, you know, everyone will laugh.

2499
01:53:33,220 --> 01:53:34,539
And it was great.

2500
01:53:34,539 --> 01:53:36,659
Everyone just, everyone kept flinging jokes.

2501
01:53:36,659 --> 01:53:39,180
There's so much laughter.

2502
01:53:39,180 --> 01:53:43,100
But the one, I mean, I'm a sucker for Amelia.

2503
01:53:46,829 --> 01:53:50,359
I'm an Amelia fan favorite.

2504
01:53:50,359 --> 01:53:53,399
Yeah, I'm a sucker for Amelia as well.

2505
01:53:53,399 --> 01:53:59,579
Cause all of it was, I mean, none of it was intended.

2506
01:53:59,579 --> 01:54:01,579
In my mind, like when we first talked about

2507
01:54:01,579 --> 01:54:03,340
the maid character on rehearsal day,

2508
01:54:03,340 --> 01:54:05,180
it was like, oh, you know, like maybe you'll come in

2509
01:54:05,180 --> 01:54:07,539
and clean and like, I'll go to work.

2510
01:54:07,539 --> 01:54:09,180
Like I might even be there.

2511
01:54:09,180 --> 01:54:13,000
And then it devolved quickly, rapidly.

2512
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:17,000
And they became, you know, their own special character.

2513
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:18,020
It's one of them.

2514
01:54:18,020 --> 01:54:20,819
Yeah, in fact, the, let's see.

2515
01:54:20,819 --> 01:54:23,020
I've got, I'll take this here.

2516
01:54:24,069 --> 01:54:26,949
One of the things that I love most

2517
01:54:26,949 --> 01:54:29,270
about the Amelia character was that we went into that

2518
01:54:29,270 --> 01:54:31,430
that day too, your first day on screen.

2519
01:54:31,430 --> 01:54:32,829
And it was just like totally supposed

2520
01:54:32,829 --> 01:54:33,829
to be a throwaway character

2521
01:54:33,829 --> 01:54:35,869
that maybe would show up a couple of times.

2522
01:54:35,869 --> 01:54:37,630
And because of chat's decisions

2523
01:54:37,630 --> 01:54:38,829
and what they were saying in chat,

2524
01:54:38,829 --> 01:54:41,289
it totally devolved into this kind of like,

2525
01:54:41,289 --> 01:54:43,130
like romantic sort of thing.

2526
01:54:43,890 --> 01:54:44,930
Self-opera.

2527
01:54:44,930 --> 01:54:47,369
Well, Jeremy invited her on a date

2528
01:54:47,369 --> 01:54:48,489
and then that became a whole thing.

2529
01:54:48,489 --> 01:54:50,050
Cause then when the date was a standup,

2530
01:54:50,050 --> 01:54:52,050
then that had to become a storyline for the next day.

2531
01:54:52,050 --> 01:54:53,090
And the date was a standup

2532
01:54:53,090 --> 01:54:54,569
because of chat's decision, right?

2533
01:54:54,569 --> 01:54:57,250
It was like they chose to make them do something

2534
01:54:57,250 --> 01:54:59,850
that made them late for the date and it didn't work.

2535
01:54:59,850 --> 01:55:03,369
And so when we all got in the room at the end of the day,

2536
01:55:03,369 --> 01:55:06,970
cause we were going live again in like whatever, 16 hours,

2537
01:55:06,970 --> 01:55:10,130
we were like, what's gonna happen with this storyline?

2538
01:55:10,130 --> 01:55:12,210
This idea of like, no,

2539
01:55:12,210 --> 01:55:15,850
like Amelia is now part of this soap opera

2540
01:55:15,850 --> 01:55:17,770
and also Amelia is Ludwig

2541
01:55:17,770 --> 01:55:21,020
and the only difference between them two is the choker.

2542
01:55:21,020 --> 01:55:21,859
Right?

2543
01:55:21,859 --> 01:55:22,699
That choker.

2544
01:55:22,699 --> 01:55:24,739
Yeah.

2545
01:55:24,739 --> 01:55:25,579
I think it's funny,

2546
01:55:25,579 --> 01:55:28,020
one time you walk into the bathroom

2547
01:55:28,020 --> 01:55:30,420
and I call you Ludwig, cause I just hear your voice.

2548
01:55:30,420 --> 01:55:31,579
So I'm just like, oh, Ludwig.

2549
01:55:31,579 --> 01:55:34,880
And you're just like, no, that's not who this is.

2550
01:55:34,880 --> 01:55:37,039
What I actually did, I went, yeah, I mean, no,

2551
01:55:37,039 --> 01:55:38,840
this is Amelia.

2552
01:55:38,840 --> 01:55:40,159
Cause I had forgotten too

2553
01:55:40,159 --> 01:55:41,520
that I was Amelia in that moment.

2554
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:43,279
I was like, oh yeah, I'm Ludwig.

2555
01:55:43,279 --> 01:55:47,409
And I was, I failed to answer.

2556
01:55:47,409 --> 01:55:48,489
Yeah.

2557
01:55:48,489 --> 01:55:52,260
It is funny how little responsibility chat would also take

2558
01:55:52,260 --> 01:55:54,899
cause they are the reason that you bailed on the date,

2559
01:55:54,899 --> 01:55:58,720
but they were furious that they had caused that to happen.

2560
01:55:58,720 --> 01:56:01,340
They turn on each other, not themselves.

2561
01:56:01,340 --> 01:56:03,579
Yeah. It's like, as soon as,

2562
01:56:03,579 --> 01:56:04,899
if anyone decided on something

2563
01:56:04,899 --> 01:56:07,380
that someone personally had not picked,

2564
01:56:07,380 --> 01:56:08,899
they just yell like rigged

2565
01:56:08,899 --> 01:56:11,460
and like attack the other sub faction of chat

2566
01:56:11,460 --> 01:56:12,460
that wanted the other thing.

2567
01:56:12,460 --> 01:56:14,779
And it was, it was pretty like surreal

2568
01:56:14,779 --> 01:56:16,060
to like set up those dominoes

2569
01:56:16,060 --> 01:56:18,060
and then sit like, let them go

2570
01:56:18,060 --> 01:56:21,090
and just see how immediate it was like dogs,

2571
01:56:21,090 --> 01:56:22,289
like fighting over a bone.

2572
01:56:22,289 --> 01:56:25,810
Like everyone would just go at each other and read.

2573
01:56:25,810 --> 01:56:26,930
Any wrong move.

2574
01:56:26,930 --> 01:56:28,130
When I took off the choker,

2575
01:56:28,130 --> 01:56:31,609
they went from loving Amelia to hating Ludwig.

2576
01:56:31,609 --> 01:56:35,569
It was that, it was the, if I, if I never revealed that,

2577
01:56:35,569 --> 01:56:36,569
it would have been fan favorite.

2578
01:56:36,569 --> 01:56:38,449
I left the villain, I left the heel.

2579
01:56:38,449 --> 01:56:39,930
Yeah.

2580
01:56:39,930 --> 01:56:42,770
Yeah. I mean, that's when we developed this thing.

2581
01:56:42,770 --> 01:56:43,729
Let me see if I can run it.

2582
01:56:44,329 --> 01:56:48,770
The Ludwig dollhouse and this concept behind like,

2583
01:56:48,770 --> 01:56:50,609
how does the stream end?

2584
01:56:50,609 --> 01:56:53,130
How does, how do we, how do we get out of this thing?

2585
01:56:53,130 --> 01:56:55,010
Was not predetermined prior to the night

2586
01:56:55,010 --> 01:56:56,409
before the last show, right?

2587
01:56:56,409 --> 01:56:57,250
It was like.

2588
01:56:57,250 --> 01:56:58,649
Shout out to the graphics department.

2589
01:56:58,649 --> 01:56:59,689
Yeah. Shout out to graphics

2590
01:56:59,689 --> 01:57:01,130
for coming up with that stuff real quick.

2591
01:57:01,130 --> 01:57:03,289
And actually for you Ludwig too,

2592
01:57:03,289 --> 01:57:05,609
for doing the recording of your little head thing, right?

2593
01:57:05,609 --> 01:57:07,289
Like that was, that was so clutch,

2594
01:57:07,289 --> 01:57:10,090
but the way that it all came together in that,

2595
01:57:10,529 --> 01:57:13,649
the save file and, and like,

2596
01:57:13,649 --> 01:57:15,850
Ludwig's takeover of the stream and then,

2597
01:57:15,850 --> 01:57:19,010
and then resetting the save file.

2598
01:57:19,010 --> 01:57:19,850
I actually have a clip.

2599
01:57:19,850 --> 01:57:20,810
That was funny.

2600
01:57:20,810 --> 01:57:22,329
I have a clip of that coming together.

2601
01:57:22,329 --> 01:57:23,250
Let me see.

2602
01:57:23,250 --> 01:57:25,289
Yeah. I thought about this last night

2603
01:57:25,289 --> 01:57:26,729
and it just like got out of the line there.

2604
01:57:26,729 --> 01:57:28,569
It like might not, if it was even,

2605
01:57:28,569 --> 01:57:30,310
it's probably too late at this point,

2606
01:57:30,310 --> 01:57:33,229
but if they could even cycle to like something else,

2607
01:57:33,229 --> 01:57:35,310
like if it was like they could cycle to Ludwig

2608
01:57:35,310 --> 01:57:37,310
and like he had his own needs bar, right?

2609
01:57:37,310 --> 01:57:39,829
Like that might be kind of fun to like have us

2610
01:57:39,829 --> 01:57:41,909
be given two different directions,

2611
01:57:41,909 --> 01:57:44,310
but at this point, that's probably way too difficult.

2612
01:57:44,310 --> 01:57:45,630
It's like 14 hours there.

2613
01:57:45,630 --> 01:57:46,829
Is there a difference you see?

2614
01:57:46,829 --> 01:57:48,069
Yeah, like 14 hours there.

2615
01:57:48,069 --> 01:57:51,109
We'd have to reset the needs bar for the person,

2616
01:57:51,109 --> 01:57:54,270
but then we get like if you had an animated face thing

2617
01:57:54,270 --> 01:57:55,829
on the bottom left, then it's no different.

2618
01:57:55,829 --> 01:57:56,909
Yeah.

2619
01:57:56,909 --> 01:57:59,460
And like I could be like pissed.

2620
01:57:59,460 --> 01:58:01,659
You're not controlling it.

2621
01:58:01,659 --> 01:58:02,500
What? No, no, no, no, no.

2622
01:58:02,500 --> 01:58:04,500
You're controlling, you're controlling, you're controlling.

2623
01:58:04,500 --> 01:58:06,460
No, no, no, no, you control me.

2624
01:58:06,460 --> 01:58:09,939
You can just vote for who they want to control.

2625
01:58:10,739 --> 01:58:12,739
I could pump like one of your IFVs

2626
01:58:12,739 --> 01:58:14,140
and be like, give me that fucking mic.

2627
01:58:14,140 --> 01:58:15,460
I mean, this is my show.

2628
01:58:16,979 --> 01:58:18,100
We're roommates now.

2629
01:58:18,100 --> 01:58:19,819
No, no, no, no, we're not roommates.

2630
01:58:19,819 --> 01:58:20,659
We're not roommates.

2631
01:58:20,659 --> 01:58:21,500
We're not roommates.

2632
01:58:21,500 --> 01:58:22,340
We're not roommates.

2633
01:58:22,340 --> 01:58:23,180
We're not roommates.

2634
01:58:23,180 --> 01:58:27,630
We like the title of the story.

2635
01:58:27,630 --> 01:58:28,710
Yeah.

2636
01:58:28,710 --> 01:58:31,390
You have like a graphic pop-up that now shows a house

2637
01:58:31,390 --> 01:58:33,789
and it says like, German plus Ludwig.

2638
01:58:33,789 --> 01:58:36,310
You're like, whoa, this isn't plus him.

2639
01:58:36,310 --> 01:58:38,029
We have the needs bar in the corner.

2640
01:58:38,029 --> 01:58:40,710
We have like the little like, yeah,

2641
01:58:40,750 --> 01:58:43,069
that face of Jeremy there that's there.

2642
01:58:43,069 --> 01:58:44,909
We took it down probably through and put the logo up

2643
01:58:44,909 --> 01:58:47,439
just because it was like, it was a lot down there.

2644
01:58:47,439 --> 01:58:48,960
But I think if you clearly then show it,

2645
01:58:48,960 --> 01:58:51,439
if we just recorded like your heads so that we had it.

2646
01:58:51,439 --> 01:58:53,319
And then I can make the same sort of overlay

2647
01:58:53,319 --> 01:58:54,159
we did for that.

2648
01:58:54,159 --> 01:58:55,000
Yeah, exactly.

2649
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:56,960
I would say like after they take control of him,

2650
01:58:56,960 --> 01:59:01,279
it should probably be another maybe 10 to 20 minutes

2651
01:59:01,279 --> 01:59:03,199
of like total time for them to do a few actions

2652
01:59:03,199 --> 01:59:04,920
to buy one or two things maybe.

2653
01:59:04,920 --> 01:59:07,279
So he does so they get actions as him

2654
01:59:07,279 --> 01:59:08,680
still during the party.

2655
01:59:08,680 --> 01:59:10,600
Oh, it'd be funny to spend all your money

2656
01:59:10,760 --> 01:59:11,600
and that's where we go.

2657
01:59:11,600 --> 01:59:13,920
And you make a big point where you like,

2658
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:15,800
they buy the most expensive shit and like,

2659
01:59:15,800 --> 01:59:17,720
but people are just like, oh man,

2660
01:59:17,720 --> 01:59:21,000
let's go get the most expensive stuff for the party.

2661
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:22,600
I find like your cash reserves,

2662
01:59:22,600 --> 01:59:23,840
we buy something else right after.

2663
01:59:23,840 --> 01:59:25,479
Yeah, he's like, it's not my money.

2664
01:59:25,479 --> 01:59:26,319
Put it up again.

2665
01:59:29,140 --> 01:59:33,699
That was the inception of the idea right there.

2666
01:59:33,699 --> 01:59:35,060
Yeah, it came together way more naturally

2667
01:59:35,060 --> 01:59:37,479
than I would have expected too.

2668
01:59:37,479 --> 01:59:38,640
Yeah, and it was all done like a day before.

2669
01:59:38,640 --> 01:59:39,960
14 hours before the show.

2670
01:59:39,960 --> 01:59:41,760
Yeah, yeah.

2671
01:59:41,760 --> 01:59:44,359
Because I remember going into like the shooting of this

2672
01:59:44,359 --> 01:59:46,079
and we like didn't know how it was gonna end

2673
01:59:46,079 --> 01:59:46,920
on the final day.

2674
01:59:46,920 --> 01:59:49,000
It was just kind of a, you know,

2675
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:50,880
because the day two had the fire

2676
01:59:50,880 --> 01:59:53,279
and that's like such a great moment.

2677
01:59:53,279 --> 01:59:54,960
But day three, it's like, you know,

2678
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:56,720
it kind of came down to whatever chat decided,

2679
01:59:56,720 --> 02:00:00,119
whatever they, you know, like they glomped onto

2680
02:00:00,119 --> 02:00:03,680
and we're like, we wanna see this plot line play through.

2681
02:00:03,680 --> 02:00:05,720
And it just happened to be Amelia, I think,

2682
02:00:05,720 --> 02:00:10,119
which felt really natural.

2683
02:00:10,119 --> 02:00:13,199
I'm looking for a clip I have of Kit backstage

2684
02:00:13,199 --> 02:00:16,399
before the reset of the game,

2685
02:00:16,439 --> 02:00:17,840
where.

2686
02:00:17,840 --> 02:00:18,720
I love Kit.

2687
02:00:18,720 --> 02:00:20,880
I have to say, I love Kit.

2688
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:23,600
Kit is like the sweetest human.

2689
02:00:23,600 --> 02:00:26,199
And then in any interaction,

2690
02:00:26,199 --> 02:00:30,039
will always be so considerate to a fault

2691
02:00:30,039 --> 02:00:34,079
on how you might've interpreted it in some negative fashion.

2692
02:00:34,079 --> 02:00:35,640
And I would always remember he'd like, you know,

2693
02:00:35,640 --> 02:00:36,880
you'd like come back or something.

2694
02:00:36,880 --> 02:00:38,039
You'd be like, was that, was that like good?

2695
02:00:38,039 --> 02:00:39,399
Was that okay with the police officer?

2696
02:00:39,399 --> 02:00:40,840
Like that was good, right?

2697
02:00:40,840 --> 02:00:41,960
And I'd be like, yeah, man, that was fire.

2698
02:00:41,960 --> 02:00:43,840
We were dope together.

2699
02:00:43,840 --> 02:00:45,640
It's always good.

2700
02:00:45,720 --> 02:00:46,560
Yeah.

2701
02:00:46,560 --> 02:00:49,779
You're the sweetest life force I could have imagined.

2702
02:00:49,779 --> 02:00:50,619
That's very kind of you to say.

2703
02:00:50,619 --> 02:00:53,010
And funny to boot, funny to boot.

2704
02:00:53,010 --> 02:00:54,020
Yeah.

2705
02:00:54,020 --> 02:00:55,819
Yeah, you're not allowed to be funny and nice by the way.

2706
02:00:55,819 --> 02:00:57,460
Okay. I already picked one.

2707
02:00:57,460 --> 02:01:00,800
Are very clearly kind of struggling at that one.

2708
02:01:00,800 --> 02:01:02,079
You're not allowed to be both.

2709
02:01:02,079 --> 02:01:03,079
All right. And better at both.

2710
02:01:03,079 --> 02:01:03,920
That's not allowed. Okay.

2711
02:01:03,920 --> 02:01:05,699
That should be banned.

2712
02:01:05,699 --> 02:01:09,390
Oh, geez.

2713
02:01:09,390 --> 02:01:10,229
I'm having a real tough time.

2714
02:01:10,229 --> 02:01:11,069
What video are you doing?

2715
02:01:11,069 --> 02:01:12,340
I still have your,

2716
02:01:12,340 --> 02:01:15,100
I still have all the cash you gave me, by the way.

2717
02:01:15,100 --> 02:01:17,140
You got the money?

2718
02:01:17,140 --> 02:01:18,100
I don't know where I put the,

2719
02:01:18,100 --> 02:01:21,460
did I give you the signed bill?

2720
02:01:21,460 --> 02:01:23,319
No, no.

2721
02:01:23,319 --> 02:01:26,960
I think I lost just the signed bill.

2722
02:01:26,960 --> 02:01:27,800
The signed stuff.

2723
02:01:27,800 --> 02:01:29,579
It's play money, by the way.

2724
02:01:29,579 --> 02:01:30,420
Just to be clear.

2725
02:01:30,420 --> 02:01:32,779
I stole all the cash from set.

2726
02:01:32,779 --> 02:01:33,859
I found out it was play money.

2727
02:01:33,859 --> 02:01:34,819
What an L.

2728
02:01:34,819 --> 02:01:36,300
But I stole all the cash from set

2729
02:01:36,300 --> 02:01:37,739
and I had people sign one

2730
02:01:37,739 --> 02:01:39,420
and I lost just the signed bill.

2731
02:01:39,420 --> 02:01:41,020
I thought you had had it,

2732
02:01:41,020 --> 02:01:41,939
but now it turns out you don't.

2733
02:01:41,939 --> 02:01:43,880
So it's gone.

2734
02:01:43,880 --> 02:01:45,180
Could you not?

2735
02:01:45,180 --> 02:01:47,340
If you want, I can sign one of these, but.

2736
02:01:47,340 --> 02:01:49,979
Did you just ship it to me?

2737
02:01:49,979 --> 02:01:52,460
The saddest signed bill of the mail.

2738
02:01:53,460 --> 02:01:55,659
Yeah, I signed it for you, kid.

2739
02:01:57,500 --> 02:01:58,340
Yay.

2740
02:01:59,779 --> 02:02:00,619
On the topic of the.

2741
02:02:00,619 --> 02:02:05,890
You guys were an amazing addition to the show.

2742
02:02:05,890 --> 02:02:09,149
One of the things that I wanted to make sure,

2743
02:02:09,149 --> 02:02:11,390
is bringing on people that,

2744
02:02:11,390 --> 02:02:14,029
you know, it's the German 985 dollhouse.

2745
02:02:14,029 --> 02:02:16,750
How do we make this happen for three days, right?

2746
02:02:16,750 --> 02:02:18,369
How do you possibly,

2747
02:02:18,369 --> 02:02:20,649
how could I be up there for three days doing,

2748
02:02:20,649 --> 02:02:21,489
oh, look at me?

2749
02:02:21,489 --> 02:02:22,930
There's only so many times I can do that

2750
02:02:22,970 --> 02:02:25,210
for like 12 straight hours.

2751
02:02:25,210 --> 02:02:26,489
So bringing on,

2752
02:02:26,489 --> 02:02:27,329
I'm just trying to,

2753
02:02:27,329 --> 02:02:28,409
we were trying to think of early on

2754
02:02:28,409 --> 02:02:31,029
who we could even like mesh with,

2755
02:02:31,029 --> 02:02:31,869
who would be fun,

2756
02:02:31,869 --> 02:02:32,689
who would be interesting,

2757
02:02:32,689 --> 02:02:33,529
who would be funny.

2758
02:02:33,529 --> 02:02:34,510
And we had some late additions, too,

2759
02:02:34,510 --> 02:02:35,869
that came in and just knocked it out of the park,

2760
02:02:35,869 --> 02:02:39,350
like Milton, Micah, Randy.

2761
02:02:39,350 --> 02:02:40,270
Milton was unbelievable.

2762
02:02:40,270 --> 02:02:42,020
Milton was a rock star.

2763
02:02:42,020 --> 02:02:44,380
He just showed up and he was,

2764
02:02:44,380 --> 02:02:47,739
he was like literally the last second possible.

2765
02:02:47,739 --> 02:02:49,420
It was like four days before the show,

2766
02:02:49,420 --> 02:02:50,779
five days before the show, right?

2767
02:02:50,779 --> 02:02:52,899
And it's just like, you want to fucking do this?

2768
02:02:53,220 --> 02:02:54,060
He killed it.

2769
02:02:54,060 --> 02:02:56,739
He was amazing.

2770
02:02:56,739 --> 02:02:57,579
Loved it.

2771
02:02:57,579 --> 02:02:59,270
I loved every contribution.

2772
02:02:59,270 --> 02:03:03,260
And we've got technical problems.

2773
02:03:03,260 --> 02:03:05,100
I can't, no, I'm looking for a clip

2774
02:03:05,100 --> 02:03:06,439
and I just, I can't find the clip.

2775
02:03:06,439 --> 02:03:11,439
There's a clip of Kit and Milton and Micah backstage

2776
02:03:11,439 --> 02:03:13,260
as we're about to start the reset sequence

2777
02:03:13,260 --> 02:03:15,369
and Kit goes like,

2778
02:03:15,369 --> 02:03:19,130
so I'm going to go out there and plead with chat to do this.

2779
02:03:19,130 --> 02:03:20,689
But I think he actually prefaces it.

2780
02:03:20,689 --> 02:03:22,689
He's like on the off chance that they pick not to do it,

2781
02:03:22,689 --> 02:03:24,010
like I'm going to go out and do this

2782
02:03:24,010 --> 02:03:25,449
and then they're going to come out after me, right?

2783
02:03:25,449 --> 02:03:27,289
It was like just the perfect setup for it.

2784
02:03:27,289 --> 02:03:28,130
I unfortunately get it.

2785
02:03:28,130 --> 02:03:28,970
Oh, at the end?

2786
02:03:28,970 --> 02:03:29,810
At the very end.

2787
02:03:29,810 --> 02:03:30,649
Yeah.

2788
02:03:30,649 --> 02:03:32,329
Well, cause you had said,

2789
02:03:32,329 --> 02:03:33,810
I don't remember who thought of it,

2790
02:03:33,810 --> 02:03:36,899
but we're talking about resetting the game.

2791
02:03:36,899 --> 02:03:39,100
And I think we all assumed that chat

2792
02:03:39,100 --> 02:03:40,619
was going to reset the game.

2793
02:03:40,619 --> 02:03:43,960
And I remember thinking, what if they don't?

2794
02:03:43,960 --> 02:03:48,069
Like they're, they might not do that.

2795
02:03:48,069 --> 02:03:51,149
And they did not do that for a very long time.

2796
02:03:51,149 --> 02:03:54,949
No, it was like five or six polls, I think.

2797
02:03:54,949 --> 02:03:55,789
Yeah.

2798
02:03:55,789 --> 02:03:56,869
I'm so glad that it happened

2799
02:03:56,869 --> 02:03:58,470
because you could have that opportunity

2800
02:03:58,470 --> 02:04:00,869
of more and more people coming and begging.

2801
02:04:00,869 --> 02:04:03,750
And like, it felt like this climax of building.

2802
02:04:03,750 --> 02:04:06,510
And it was like, I don't know if you guys saw the percentages,

2803
02:04:06,510 --> 02:04:10,149
but it was a matter of 1% to 3% difference every time.

2804
02:04:10,149 --> 02:04:12,069
Like it was down to the wire.

2805
02:04:12,069 --> 02:04:15,649
Chat was just ravenously like battling each other

2806
02:04:15,649 --> 02:04:17,090
to try to push it one way or another.

2807
02:04:17,090 --> 02:04:19,250
And it felt like a real climax.

2808
02:04:19,250 --> 02:04:20,090
It was really cool.

2809
02:04:20,090 --> 02:04:20,930
And just to be clear, Craig,

2810
02:04:20,930 --> 02:04:22,850
and you can talk about this a little bit too.

2811
02:04:22,850 --> 02:04:25,310
We had no way to rig the poll.

2812
02:04:25,310 --> 02:04:26,590
It's not like,

2813
02:04:26,590 --> 02:04:28,390
because at some point during that sequence,

2814
02:04:28,390 --> 02:04:31,560
I was like, can we just like push it over the edge?

2815
02:04:31,560 --> 02:04:32,560
And Craig, it's like,

2816
02:04:32,560 --> 02:04:34,800
we physically don't have a mechanism to change.

2817
02:04:34,800 --> 02:04:37,600
Like the data comes in and it goes into it and that's it.

2818
02:04:37,600 --> 02:04:38,439
Yeah.

2819
02:04:38,439 --> 02:04:42,000
The only bug that people saw that I'm aware of

2820
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,439
was the sorting issue in like the first day,

2821
02:04:44,439 --> 02:04:47,520
where like it would show a winner,

2822
02:04:47,520 --> 02:04:50,000
even though another thing had a bigger percentage.

2823
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:53,319
And that was purely like our UI pushing the wrong winner

2824
02:04:53,319 --> 02:04:54,880
out of a sorting issue.

2825
02:04:54,920 --> 02:04:57,260
But all the numbers were calculated.

2826
02:04:57,260 --> 02:04:59,420
And you can see that like the majority votes

2827
02:04:59,420 --> 02:05:00,619
went to the right thing.

2828
02:05:00,619 --> 02:05:02,380
So none of that was padded in any way.

2829
02:05:02,380 --> 02:05:04,340
It was all literally what Chat picked.

2830
02:05:04,340 --> 02:05:07,010
And we just had to like preempt

2831
02:05:07,010 --> 02:05:08,930
kind of what we expected Chat to go for.

2832
02:05:08,930 --> 02:05:11,329
But even then we had contingency plans

2833
02:05:11,329 --> 02:05:12,729
for like literally everything,

2834
02:05:12,729 --> 02:05:15,170
which I think is the awesome part about the show is like,

2835
02:05:15,170 --> 02:05:17,369
there's a, and so just to segue,

2836
02:05:17,369 --> 02:05:19,130
I guess it's like my favorite thing of the show

2837
02:05:19,130 --> 02:05:21,729
was the whole Uncle Ted segment where,

2838
02:05:21,729 --> 02:05:24,329
you know, Chat voted for him to check the mail.

2839
02:05:24,329 --> 02:05:26,689
That led to him getting a letter and we're like,

2840
02:05:26,689 --> 02:05:27,689
we need him to get more money.

2841
02:05:27,689 --> 02:05:30,170
So I guess we'll do inheritance.

2842
02:05:30,170 --> 02:05:33,609
And so I pushed the notification of his uncle died,

2843
02:05:33,609 --> 02:05:35,010
which then went to,

2844
02:05:35,010 --> 02:05:37,890
he made up the name Uncle Ted when talking to his mom,

2845
02:05:37,890 --> 02:05:38,970
which then went to Chat,

2846
02:05:38,970 --> 02:05:40,689
like lamenting the death of Uncle Ted

2847
02:05:40,689 --> 02:05:42,729
and how he was like weirdly happy about it,

2848
02:05:42,729 --> 02:05:44,529
which then went into like day two,

2849
02:05:44,529 --> 02:05:46,010
we're like, well, we needed him to get more furniture,

2850
02:05:46,010 --> 02:05:47,569
but he has 20 bucks in the bank.

2851
02:05:47,569 --> 02:05:49,369
And I was like, what if we made, you know,

2852
02:05:49,369 --> 02:05:51,170
a set of furniture that was free

2853
02:05:51,170 --> 02:05:53,130
because it was Uncle Ted's inheritance set.

2854
02:05:53,170 --> 02:05:56,010
And so Chat of course goes and buys that because it's free.

2855
02:05:56,010 --> 02:05:58,369
And so we were like, kind of setting all these pieces.

2856
02:05:58,369 --> 02:06:00,729
And then, you know, once they get that set,

2857
02:06:00,729 --> 02:06:03,609
that enables our character Blair

2858
02:06:03,609 --> 02:06:06,210
to play Uncle Ted and come on set.

2859
02:06:06,210 --> 02:06:08,529
And then we even had the decision of whether or not

2860
02:06:08,529 --> 02:06:09,449
to kill him.

2861
02:06:09,449 --> 02:06:11,369
And like, we thought Chat was going to kill him because,

2862
02:06:11,369 --> 02:06:13,289
you know, you guys are psychopaths, but you know,

2863
02:06:13,289 --> 02:06:17,050
there was an option of this where you don't kill Uncle Ted

2864
02:06:17,050 --> 02:06:18,689
and he's a character for the rest of the show.

2865
02:06:18,689 --> 02:06:20,609
Like that, we were prepared for that.

2866
02:06:20,609 --> 02:06:22,930
And he could have been around for the party.

2867
02:06:23,729 --> 02:06:25,689
He could have been like a consistent guy,

2868
02:06:25,689 --> 02:06:27,409
but they're like, oh, he's a ghost.

2869
02:06:27,409 --> 02:06:28,449
Call the Grim Reaper.

2870
02:06:29,489 --> 02:06:32,649
And yeah, that whole bit was my favorite.

2871
02:06:32,649 --> 02:06:35,529
Yeah, because if you had called like the priest,

2872
02:06:35,529 --> 02:06:36,689
priest would have probably showed up

2873
02:06:36,689 --> 02:06:38,569
and been like, this person's alive.

2874
02:06:38,569 --> 02:06:41,050
Like maybe like do an exorcism on them,

2875
02:06:41,050 --> 02:06:41,970
but this person's alive.

2876
02:06:41,970 --> 02:06:42,810
I don't need to.

2877
02:06:44,250 --> 02:06:46,409
This is actually a clip of them waiting backstage

2878
02:06:46,409 --> 02:06:48,810
to see which way Chat goes.

2879
02:06:48,810 --> 02:06:51,340
That's awesome.

2880
02:06:51,340 --> 02:06:54,770
Yeah, I don't know if you've shown too many moments

2881
02:06:54,770 --> 02:07:00,619
like that yet where we sometimes had these trees

2882
02:07:00,619 --> 02:07:04,500
where we knew every possible thing that Chat could vote on.

2883
02:07:04,500 --> 02:07:07,699
And so we would, all of us would be suiting up

2884
02:07:07,699 --> 02:07:11,579
or like getting ready for whatever character.

2885
02:07:11,579 --> 02:07:14,979
And then if it didn't get called, we'd just walk back.

2886
02:07:14,979 --> 02:07:18,840
Yeah, I actually, I have a, go ahead.

2887
02:07:18,840 --> 02:07:19,920
That was the worst for Kit

2888
02:07:19,920 --> 02:07:22,920
because Kit, he would be like Edna, the policeman.

2889
02:07:22,920 --> 02:07:26,279
He'd have to like swap the most insane costumes.

2890
02:07:26,279 --> 02:07:27,279
Mia would be like, all right.

2891
02:07:27,279 --> 02:07:28,720
Not the bear though, but.

2892
02:07:29,720 --> 02:07:30,560
Yeah, that's true.

2893
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:32,689
The bear actually was brutal.

2894
02:07:32,689 --> 02:07:34,149
Yeah.

2895
02:07:34,149 --> 02:07:35,989
I'm gonna show my crib sheet.

2896
02:07:35,989 --> 02:07:38,189
So this is how the entire show was run

2897
02:07:38,189 --> 02:07:40,130
off this piece of paper here.

2898
02:07:41,130 --> 02:07:41,970
And.

2899
02:07:41,970 --> 02:07:43,250
A lot of lines.

2900
02:07:43,250 --> 02:07:47,210
Yeah, so this was not made months in advance.

2901
02:07:47,210 --> 02:07:49,970
In fact, this was made after the first stream

2902
02:07:49,970 --> 02:07:53,689
before the second stream of here are all the events.

2903
02:07:53,689 --> 02:07:54,890
Here's who's involved with them.

2904
02:07:54,890 --> 02:07:57,449
Here are the Chat options for them.

2905
02:07:57,449 --> 02:07:59,529
And then we had other notes about like

2906
02:07:59,529 --> 02:08:01,810
what all those different Chat options entailed.

2907
02:08:01,810 --> 02:08:04,729
But then as we were going, I'd be making notes about,

2908
02:08:04,729 --> 02:08:06,250
okay, how is this changing?

2909
02:08:06,250 --> 02:08:08,289
How is what transpired gonna affect

2910
02:08:08,289 --> 02:08:10,289
what's happening in the future?

2911
02:08:10,289 --> 02:08:11,409
Who's involved with what?

2912
02:08:11,409 --> 02:08:13,210
Who needs to be in what costume, what and where?

2913
02:08:13,210 --> 02:08:16,090
And so this was kind of like the master sheet

2914
02:08:16,090 --> 02:08:18,850
of what we had done already and what was left to do

2915
02:08:18,850 --> 02:08:20,850
and what options we had left.

2916
02:08:20,850 --> 02:08:22,529
And you can see there's some things on here

2917
02:08:22,529 --> 02:08:24,010
that we never did.

2918
02:08:24,010 --> 02:08:25,090
We never had the sleepover.

2919
02:08:25,090 --> 02:08:26,390
The lures by it.

2920
02:08:26,390 --> 02:08:27,409
Yeah.

2921
02:08:28,090 --> 02:08:29,359
The sleepover.

2922
02:08:29,359 --> 02:08:30,199
Yeah, the sleepover.

2923
02:08:30,199 --> 02:08:31,840
And the other one was the check.

2924
02:08:31,840 --> 02:08:33,699
You missed out.

2925
02:08:33,699 --> 02:08:34,539
The check.

2926
02:08:34,539 --> 02:08:36,060
Oh, I forgot about that.

2927
02:08:36,060 --> 02:08:38,100
Oh yeah, the giant, the giant like,

2928
02:08:38,100 --> 02:08:38,939
Jack, I forgot about that.

2929
02:08:38,939 --> 02:08:39,760
What was it called?

2930
02:08:39,760 --> 02:08:40,600
Publishers Clearinghouse.

2931
02:08:40,600 --> 02:08:41,439
Yeah, it was called like,

2932
02:08:41,439 --> 02:08:43,539
I think we called it Editors.

2933
02:08:43,539 --> 02:08:44,380
Sweepstakes.

2934
02:08:44,380 --> 02:08:45,220
Editors Sweepstakes.

2935
02:08:45,220 --> 02:08:46,060
Oh, you guys made it.

2936
02:08:46,060 --> 02:08:48,340
You made the whole check and everything too.

2937
02:08:48,340 --> 02:08:50,510
I'm looking for the photo of it.

2938
02:08:50,510 --> 02:08:52,260
It was a beautiful check.

2939
02:08:52,260 --> 02:08:53,609
Yeah, there it is.

2940
02:08:53,609 --> 02:08:55,449
Yeah, and even when people showed up,

2941
02:08:55,449 --> 02:08:58,539
because anytime that somebody knocked on the door,

2942
02:08:58,579 --> 02:09:01,539
it was up to essentially you guys to send people,

2943
02:09:01,539 --> 02:09:02,899
like you chat, right?

2944
02:09:02,899 --> 02:09:04,819
But once they were in the house,

2945
02:09:04,819 --> 02:09:06,100
it was pretty much fair game

2946
02:09:06,100 --> 02:09:07,739
to make up a random storyline with Improv

2947
02:09:07,739 --> 02:09:09,300
and just see where it went from there.

2948
02:09:09,300 --> 02:09:12,109
And doing the weird stuff with,

2949
02:09:12,109 --> 02:09:14,909
needing you guys adding like a variable,

2950
02:09:14,909 --> 02:09:16,310
but like, oh, you're gonna call the bear now.

2951
02:09:16,310 --> 02:09:17,149
Oh, go to the bathroom.

2952
02:09:17,149 --> 02:09:18,390
Oh, go in the shower.

2953
02:09:18,390 --> 02:09:20,149
I just kind of created a bunch more dynamic

2954
02:09:20,149 --> 02:09:23,609
and it gave for different storylines

2955
02:09:23,609 --> 02:09:24,909
to just be made up on the fly,

2956
02:09:24,909 --> 02:09:26,390
even stuff that wasn't even written down.

2957
02:09:26,390 --> 02:09:27,829
So it was really cool.

2958
02:09:27,829 --> 02:09:32,829
I really liked how inspired by Scooby-Doo you were, Ludwig.

2959
02:09:34,380 --> 02:09:35,220
All those Scooby-Doo.

2960
02:09:35,220 --> 02:09:39,010
Oh yeah, you were really into the Scooby-Doo stuff.

2961
02:09:39,010 --> 02:09:40,210
Obsessed, I don't know.

2962
02:09:40,210 --> 02:09:41,369
I think it's so funny,

2963
02:09:41,369 --> 02:09:44,130
like the just happened to have missed him,

2964
02:09:44,130 --> 02:09:45,409
walked into a different door.

2965
02:09:45,409 --> 02:09:47,180
They walk out another door.

2966
02:09:47,180 --> 02:09:48,819
I don't like that physical comedy.

2967
02:09:48,819 --> 02:09:51,659
I could be 75 and also think it's funny.

2968
02:09:51,659 --> 02:09:53,760
Or the cabinet in the kitchen.

2969
02:09:53,760 --> 02:09:57,470
I also battered my knee.

2970
02:09:57,470 --> 02:09:59,029
You still have bruised that?

2971
02:09:59,029 --> 02:10:00,789
Oh my God.

2972
02:10:00,789 --> 02:10:01,630
You see that?

2973
02:10:01,630 --> 02:10:02,470
That's from a-

2974
02:10:02,470 --> 02:10:04,829
Looks like you got hit by a softball.

2975
02:10:04,829 --> 02:10:06,470
It was from exiting the house

2976
02:10:06,470 --> 02:10:09,869
as a robber through the window.

2977
02:10:09,869 --> 02:10:14,439
Yeah, I didn't even recognize until like the next day.

2978
02:10:14,439 --> 02:10:15,279
Dang.

2979
02:10:15,279 --> 02:10:17,899
That's bad.

2980
02:10:17,899 --> 02:10:20,420
That was quite the stunt.

2981
02:10:20,420 --> 02:10:21,539
We all signed waivers, right?

2982
02:10:21,539 --> 02:10:22,979
We signed waivers, didn't we?

2983
02:10:24,300 --> 02:10:26,260
Look, if I complain after you jumped out of a window

2984
02:10:26,260 --> 02:10:27,420
in a glass, I think.

2985
02:10:30,149 --> 02:10:32,430
But I guess I would say who won the house.

2986
02:10:32,430 --> 02:10:33,590
I can't complain.

2987
02:10:34,510 --> 02:10:43,939
I have here the things we had at the door, the disclaimer.

2988
02:10:43,939 --> 02:10:45,500
Was there a disclaimer?

2989
02:10:45,500 --> 02:10:46,340
Oh yeah.

2990
02:10:48,340 --> 02:10:49,899
I'll go with one of my favorite things

2991
02:10:49,899 --> 02:10:51,260
of the whole entire week.

2992
02:10:51,260 --> 02:10:52,979
Oh yeah, nobody asked you, huh?

2993
02:10:52,979 --> 02:10:53,819
I was gonna-

2994
02:10:53,819 --> 02:10:56,239
I don't think he asked.

2995
02:10:56,239 --> 02:10:58,000
He didn't even ask me.

2996
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,699
Kitten, when you and I were in the DIY room,

2997
02:11:00,699 --> 02:11:02,859
and the amount of times that I'm swinging the hammer around,

2998
02:11:02,859 --> 02:11:05,819
how you are actually not acting visibly scared of me.

2999
02:11:06,659 --> 02:11:09,449
It's pretty funny.

3000
02:11:09,449 --> 02:11:11,770
People are like, hey dude, you know you came pretty close

3001
02:11:11,770 --> 02:11:13,810
like three or four times to hitting me in the back?

3002
02:11:13,810 --> 02:11:17,279
And I'm like, no, I didn't, not even talking about.

3003
02:11:17,279 --> 02:11:22,140
I didn't know that you hadn't done some of that stuff.

3004
02:11:22,140 --> 02:11:25,380
So yeah, I was just a little bit afraid a few times.

3005
02:11:27,020 --> 02:11:29,300
I heard you on your channel the other day

3006
02:11:29,300 --> 02:11:31,500
and you were like, yeah, I didn't realize

3007
02:11:31,500 --> 02:11:34,739
that Jeremy had never done anything before.

3008
02:11:34,739 --> 02:11:36,819
He didn't know how to use a paint,

3009
02:11:36,899 --> 02:11:39,579
he didn't know how to use a hammer.

3010
02:11:39,579 --> 02:11:41,739
I'm not trying to like shame you, I just didn't know.

3011
02:11:41,739 --> 02:11:43,180
Like soft, unused hands.

3012
02:11:45,609 --> 02:11:47,420
I just didn't know.

3013
02:11:47,420 --> 02:11:48,699
There's the signs.

3014
02:11:48,699 --> 02:11:49,539
That's so funny.

3015
02:11:49,539 --> 02:11:52,100
There's a part where you pick up the sledgehammer

3016
02:11:52,100 --> 02:11:54,340
and you just like kind of slowly got golf swing

3017
02:11:54,340 --> 02:11:57,399
into the wall, just making little holes.

3018
02:11:57,399 --> 02:11:59,199
And then when you pull the painting down

3019
02:11:59,199 --> 02:12:01,239
and it's just like, you didn't get the painting.

3020
02:12:01,239 --> 02:12:03,039
And then the safe opens.

3021
02:12:03,039 --> 02:12:04,479
The safe actually opens,

3022
02:12:04,479 --> 02:12:05,319
like before we even get to see it.

3023
02:12:05,319 --> 02:12:07,149
Did Chad see that?

3024
02:12:07,149 --> 02:12:08,189
Did Chad see that?

3025
02:12:08,229 --> 02:12:09,609
I think they did.

3026
02:12:09,609 --> 02:12:10,449
Oh, they didn't.

3027
02:12:10,449 --> 02:12:11,289
Oh.

3028
02:12:11,289 --> 02:12:12,210
We hit the safe open.

3029
02:12:12,210 --> 02:12:13,489
I didn't know about this.

3030
02:12:13,489 --> 02:12:17,689
So I left the safe not latched

3031
02:12:17,689 --> 02:12:21,899
because in rehearsal, Ludwig, you got it open,

3032
02:12:21,899 --> 02:12:24,180
but you, it was like, I was like worried about it.

3033
02:12:24,180 --> 02:12:27,899
And I was like, what if you can't get it open, right?

3034
02:12:27,899 --> 02:12:30,140
So then I was like, okay, I'm gonna leave it,

3035
02:12:30,140 --> 02:12:31,220
but not completely latched.

3036
02:12:31,220 --> 02:12:32,420
But then I should have thought

3037
02:12:32,420 --> 02:12:37,039
that they were gonna try the handle on stream.

3038
02:12:37,039 --> 02:12:37,880
Just open.

3039
02:12:38,159 --> 02:12:39,000
That's my bad, yeah.

3040
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,609
It opens.

3041
02:12:41,609 --> 02:12:42,930
Yeah, the fact that that's,

3042
02:12:42,930 --> 02:12:44,649
because that kind of thing was supposed to come down,

3043
02:12:44,649 --> 02:12:46,569
but part of me was like kind of scared

3044
02:12:46,569 --> 02:12:48,489
just to hit those poles.

3045
02:12:48,489 --> 02:12:49,329
I feel like I was like,

3046
02:12:49,329 --> 02:12:52,329
I'm scared I'm gonna take the whole second floor down.

3047
02:12:52,329 --> 02:12:53,329
That would be so bad.

3048
02:12:53,329 --> 02:12:56,250
Like I take a giant swing, hit one of those podiums.

3049
02:12:56,250 --> 02:12:57,569
And then all of a sudden, like me and Kit

3050
02:12:57,569 --> 02:12:58,770
just dropped through the floor,

3051
02:12:58,770 --> 02:13:00,800
like home alone two.

3052
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:03,479
But you went during the party back up there

3053
02:13:03,479 --> 02:13:05,640
with the sledgehammer to hit those actual

3054
02:13:05,640 --> 02:13:07,000
like connecting frames.

3055
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:08,800
You were on some shit at that party, man.

3056
02:13:08,800 --> 02:13:11,640
You were like, this is the final scene.

3057
02:13:11,640 --> 02:13:13,560
I'm gonna do whatever I want.

3058
02:13:13,560 --> 02:13:14,840
Well, it was like the end of the stream.

3059
02:13:14,840 --> 02:13:16,439
It was like, it was the end of the whole week.

3060
02:13:16,439 --> 02:13:18,600
I was like, fuck it, let's just swing it.

3061
02:13:24,300 --> 02:13:26,460
We talked a few minutes ago about

3062
02:13:26,460 --> 02:13:30,699
how things sort of came to happen as the show went on.

3063
02:13:30,699 --> 02:13:35,000
And we had like, we had a finite number of costumes

3064
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:35,960
and a finite number of props,

3065
02:13:35,960 --> 02:13:37,479
but like exactly what was gonna happen with them

3066
02:13:37,479 --> 02:13:39,279
wasn't like predefined.

3067
02:13:39,319 --> 02:13:44,560
So I have a cool little clip here of Kit coming with Milton,

3068
02:13:45,399 --> 02:13:48,239
who's the prisoner, out onto stage.

3069
02:13:48,239 --> 02:13:51,560
And what I think is cool about this clip,

3070
02:13:51,560 --> 02:13:53,319
nothing particularly exciting happens in it,

3071
02:13:53,319 --> 02:13:55,680
but it kind of gives you the perspective of

3072
02:13:55,680 --> 02:13:57,840
they leave the green room to come to the stage.

3073
02:13:57,840 --> 02:13:59,239
What is that process like?

3074
02:14:12,069 --> 02:14:13,819
Was it raining?

3075
02:14:13,819 --> 02:14:14,659
It was raining.

3076
02:14:17,220 --> 02:14:19,380
So we could barely hear each other talking.

3077
02:14:19,420 --> 02:14:26,680
Yeah, it was leaking too, right?

3078
02:14:26,680 --> 02:14:28,619
You guys talk about it yet?

3079
02:14:28,619 --> 02:14:29,779
No.

3080
02:14:29,779 --> 02:14:30,819
Oh yeah.

3081
02:14:30,819 --> 02:14:34,140
Yeah, I would pause it and talk about that for one second.

3082
02:14:34,140 --> 02:14:36,340
So during this portion here, when it was actually,

3083
02:14:36,340 --> 02:14:39,300
it was pouring like monsoon type rain.

3084
02:14:39,300 --> 02:14:43,020
And when they were inside, Kit and Milton,

3085
02:14:43,020 --> 02:14:45,060
we could barely even hear,

3086
02:14:45,060 --> 02:14:47,140
it was like talking over a vacuum cleaner.

3087
02:14:47,140 --> 02:14:49,699
And one of the things that was happening backstage was,

3088
02:14:49,699 --> 02:14:51,699
and there's a part of the stream where I look up

3089
02:14:51,699 --> 02:14:53,220
and I'm getting hit in the face by water.

3090
02:14:53,220 --> 02:14:54,340
And I don't know if you got it or not.

3091
02:14:54,340 --> 02:14:56,220
I think it was right here.

3092
02:14:56,220 --> 02:14:57,699
Yeah, it's like right at this point here.

3093
02:14:57,699 --> 02:14:59,979
I'm getting hit directly in the face by water.

3094
02:14:59,979 --> 02:15:02,060
And it was just real water coming from the ceiling.

3095
02:15:02,060 --> 02:15:04,939
And Jake, maybe you can logistically talk about where it was,

3096
02:15:04,939 --> 02:15:07,539
but it was like a transformer.

3097
02:15:07,539 --> 02:15:08,380
Yeah, right behind this wall.

3098
02:15:08,380 --> 02:15:11,779
Well, Kit is the one that saw it, right?

3099
02:15:11,779 --> 02:15:13,619
Oh, Kit, it was you, Kit.

3100
02:15:13,619 --> 02:15:14,899
It's like right next to us.

3101
02:15:14,899 --> 02:15:18,300
Milton and I, yeah, it's right behind where we were.

3102
02:15:18,300 --> 02:15:21,539
We just heard water pouring.

3103
02:15:21,539 --> 02:15:22,619
What is that?

3104
02:15:23,300 --> 02:15:26,619
And so he tells Josh who's standing back,

3105
02:15:26,619 --> 02:15:29,220
and I wonder if it's even in this clip actually,

3106
02:15:29,220 --> 02:15:31,260
where he tells him, I'll lower the audio here

3107
02:15:31,260 --> 02:15:35,479
so it's not rounding us out.

3108
02:15:35,479 --> 02:15:37,520
But yeah, so I get a call on the radio.

3109
02:15:37,520 --> 02:15:40,600
Josh is like, hey, Jake, we got some leakage.

3110
02:15:40,600 --> 02:15:42,720
And like a few people had mentioned,

3111
02:15:42,720 --> 02:15:44,560
cause like we knew there were a couple spots on the set

3112
02:15:44,560 --> 02:15:45,399
where water would come down.

3113
02:15:45,399 --> 02:15:47,199
We knew it wasn't gonna be a problem or whatever.

3114
02:15:47,199 --> 02:15:49,520
And Josh is like, no, no, no, this is down

3115
02:15:49,520 --> 02:15:50,920
by the transformer.

3116
02:15:50,920 --> 02:15:54,239
And I'm like, oh God, hang on one second.

3117
02:15:54,239 --> 02:15:57,199
So I come back there and I don't know

3118
02:15:57,199 --> 02:16:00,239
if we actually have any photos of the transformer set up,

3119
02:16:00,239 --> 02:16:01,859
but the-

3120
02:16:01,859 --> 02:16:02,939
Imagine electrical stuff.

3121
02:16:02,939 --> 02:16:05,140
There's two, yeah, there's these two transformers

3122
02:16:05,140 --> 02:16:07,579
that are the size of a car, like a small car,

3123
02:16:07,579 --> 02:16:11,020
like a beetle and then maybe like a large motorcycle

3124
02:16:11,020 --> 02:16:12,260
like next to each other.

3125
02:16:12,260 --> 02:16:16,380
And they take, we hit 480 volt service

3126
02:16:16,380 --> 02:16:17,460
and they step it down to what we need

3127
02:16:17,460 --> 02:16:19,220
for the lights and the motors and stuff.

3128
02:16:19,260 --> 02:16:23,180
And sure as shit, there's water coming down

3129
02:16:23,180 --> 02:16:26,579
like a foot away from one of these transformers.

3130
02:16:26,579 --> 02:16:29,500
And so I run to get a bucket and Josh runs

3131
02:16:29,500 --> 02:16:31,779
to get like some towels or something and clean it up.

3132
02:16:31,779 --> 02:16:34,459
And like we were fine, everything was cool.

3133
02:16:34,459 --> 02:16:35,819
And thankfully the rain only lasted

3134
02:16:35,819 --> 02:16:37,340
for like 20 or 25 minutes.

3135
02:16:37,340 --> 02:16:39,260
So it just kind of came and then it went

3136
02:16:39,260 --> 02:16:40,100
and it was over with.

3137
02:16:40,100 --> 02:16:43,219
But it was just like, it was just our luck.

3138
02:16:43,219 --> 02:16:45,100
And so while it was happening,

3139
02:16:45,100 --> 02:16:46,940
we didn't know how much it was picking up on the mics.

3140
02:16:46,940 --> 02:16:49,059
Fortunately, it wasn't that much.

3141
02:16:49,059 --> 02:16:52,340
Mark did a good job with some noise suppression and stuff.

3142
02:16:52,340 --> 02:16:56,459
But if you notice closely in those scenes,

3143
02:16:56,459 --> 02:16:59,899
we set the TV monitors inside the rooms

3144
02:16:59,899 --> 02:17:02,540
and the outside graphic to be raining.

3145
02:17:02,540 --> 02:17:03,459
So it looked like it's raining.

3146
02:17:03,459 --> 02:17:05,899
So if you did hear any rain noise,

3147
02:17:05,899 --> 02:17:07,780
you would at least think, oh, they're adding rain noise.

3148
02:17:07,780 --> 02:17:09,979
And then the person that talks to Jeremy in his ear

3149
02:17:09,979 --> 02:17:12,379
also made sure to have him say multiple times

3150
02:17:12,379 --> 02:17:14,219
about how it's raining and look out the window and stuff.

3151
02:17:14,219 --> 02:17:16,379
So we tried to cover that stuff.

3152
02:17:16,420 --> 02:17:19,459
And we did have the power outage thing too.

3153
02:17:19,459 --> 02:17:23,530
So that was like, oh, rain and storms can happen.

3154
02:17:23,530 --> 02:17:26,010
When you told me it was raining and you held your hand out,

3155
02:17:26,010 --> 02:17:27,850
I think it's around the scene.

3156
02:17:27,850 --> 02:17:30,329
I just ignored it and pretended you were crazy.

3157
02:17:30,329 --> 02:17:32,450
But yeah, it was real rain.

3158
02:17:35,549 --> 02:17:37,149
Oh yeah, there's a part where I'm just like

3159
02:17:37,149 --> 02:17:39,549
going like this in front of you and it's hitting my hand.

3160
02:17:39,549 --> 02:17:42,690
I think it's like right around here where you,

3161
02:17:42,690 --> 02:17:44,940
this scene, but yeah.

3162
02:17:44,940 --> 02:17:45,780
This also gives you an idea

3163
02:17:45,780 --> 02:17:47,100
of what they can see backstage, right?

3164
02:17:47,100 --> 02:17:48,940
You could see basically a security camera view

3165
02:17:48,979 --> 02:17:50,940
of every room to get an idea of where people are

3166
02:17:50,940 --> 02:17:53,819
for if you're planning improv ideas and whatnot.

3167
02:17:53,819 --> 02:17:55,940
And they could see chat, they could see you guys going by

3168
02:17:55,940 --> 02:17:58,700
and they could see what you see.

3169
02:17:58,700 --> 02:17:59,540
Yeah, Josh was a huge-

3170
02:17:59,540 --> 02:18:03,899
You had like a beautiful moment with the rain.

3171
02:18:03,899 --> 02:18:05,780
What was that?

3172
02:18:05,780 --> 02:18:07,139
I was just saying that he had a beautiful moment

3173
02:18:07,139 --> 02:18:08,819
with the rain where it was hitting his head.

3174
02:18:08,819 --> 02:18:10,180
But you were saying about Josh?

3175
02:18:10,180 --> 02:18:11,139
Oh yeah.

3176
02:18:12,059 --> 02:18:15,739
Just gonna say Josh was a huge asset for us

3177
02:18:15,739 --> 02:18:20,139
because in terms of like coming out and queuing us up

3178
02:18:20,139 --> 02:18:22,770
for what was gonna happen,

3179
02:18:23,610 --> 02:18:24,930
that was me saying, can I go to the bathroom?

3180
02:18:24,930 --> 02:18:26,250
Oh yeah.

3181
02:18:26,250 --> 02:18:29,010
So he would figure us for going to the bathroom.

3182
02:18:29,010 --> 02:18:31,969
I remember that because then someone on call was like,

3183
02:18:31,969 --> 02:18:34,010
all right, queue kit and mill in

3184
02:18:34,010 --> 02:18:35,969
and Josh is like, he's in the bathroom.

3185
02:18:37,010 --> 02:18:41,239
All right, Jeremy, you need to be up for 30 more seconds.

3186
02:18:41,239 --> 02:18:45,370
There was a point where I ran to the bathroom too.

3187
02:18:45,370 --> 02:18:48,170
Oh, he was a rock star.

3188
02:18:48,170 --> 02:18:49,649
Yeah, there was a point where I ran away

3189
02:18:49,649 --> 02:18:51,329
and peed in like the urinal.

3190
02:18:51,329 --> 02:18:52,649
And I think I said over the mic, I was like,

3191
02:18:52,649 --> 02:18:53,850
I hope I'm not on,

3192
02:18:53,850 --> 02:18:55,850
I hope you have my mics at zero

3193
02:18:55,850 --> 02:18:58,540
because you can probably just hear me pissing.

3194
02:18:58,540 --> 02:19:00,459
Yeah, there was only one moment I can remember

3195
02:19:00,459 --> 02:19:02,659
where we cut to like the wide shot of the house

3196
02:19:02,659 --> 02:19:04,100
when they're picking a room

3197
02:19:04,100 --> 02:19:05,500
and you were not in bed

3198
02:19:05,500 --> 02:19:07,479
because you were going to the bathroom

3199
02:19:07,479 --> 02:19:11,090
and we're like, someone just finally said in the mics like,

3200
02:19:11,090 --> 02:19:12,049
could you hear it?

3201
02:19:12,049 --> 02:19:12,889
Not there, is he?

3202
02:19:12,889 --> 02:19:13,729
No, no, we couldn't hear you.

3203
02:19:13,729 --> 02:19:14,569
We couldn't hear you.

3204
02:19:14,569 --> 02:19:15,409
We had the mics up.

3205
02:19:15,409 --> 02:19:16,250
It was joking.

3206
02:19:16,250 --> 02:19:19,489
He just vanished overnight and chat slowly was like,

3207
02:19:19,489 --> 02:19:20,930
wait, where is he?

3208
02:19:20,930 --> 02:19:22,649
Oh no, what happened to our streamer?

3209
02:19:22,649 --> 02:19:24,729
And then like, we cut back and we're back.

3210
02:19:27,500 --> 02:19:32,139
This is a moment I have of when God enters the scene

3211
02:19:32,139 --> 02:19:34,739
and this is actual behind the scenes footage

3212
02:19:34,739 --> 02:19:37,020
as it happens as it plays out.

3213
02:19:47,069 --> 02:19:48,750
We should do a version of this with crew audio too.

3214
02:19:48,750 --> 02:19:49,590
That'd be good.

3215
02:19:52,780 --> 02:19:53,620
Yeah.

3216
02:19:53,620 --> 02:19:54,500
I need you this way.

3217
02:19:54,500 --> 02:19:55,340
Quick, quick.

3218
02:19:55,340 --> 02:19:57,059
Here, go.

3219
02:19:57,059 --> 02:19:58,780
Gotta get his car ready.

3220
02:19:58,780 --> 02:19:59,620
Quick.

3221
02:19:59,620 --> 02:20:00,459
Go!

3222
02:20:01,379 --> 02:20:03,219
That's like pretty much what it was like,

3223
02:20:03,219 --> 02:20:04,579
but it was great.

3224
02:20:04,620 --> 02:20:05,540
Grossly car.

3225
02:20:06,909 --> 02:20:08,030
Oh yeah, those shoes, by the way,

3226
02:20:08,030 --> 02:20:09,629
are about a half the size of my feet.

3227
02:20:09,629 --> 02:20:10,469
Like, I was.

3228
02:20:21,989 --> 02:20:24,190
But it's the real thing, you know?

3229
02:20:24,190 --> 02:20:25,430
There's like multiple moments that hit me

3230
02:20:25,430 --> 02:20:27,829
while we were running this thing, just like.

3231
02:20:27,829 --> 02:20:29,469
And this thing goes so slow.

3232
02:20:29,469 --> 02:20:31,790
Like, was this, was this low on battery?

3233
02:20:31,790 --> 02:20:33,389
Cause this thing goes so slow.

3234
02:20:33,389 --> 02:20:34,590
There was a faster option,

3235
02:20:34,590 --> 02:20:38,309
but I was terrified of just running to the side of the set.

3236
02:20:38,309 --> 02:20:53,940
So I was like, I'll just go slowly towards him.

3237
02:20:53,979 --> 02:20:56,579
This scene has to be sacrilegious.

3238
02:20:56,579 --> 02:20:57,420
Yeah.

3239
02:20:57,420 --> 02:20:58,260
I might be going to hell for this.

3240
02:20:58,260 --> 02:20:59,100
Oh, I'm sure it is.

3241
02:21:02,110 --> 02:21:03,229
I'm in a clown car.

3242
02:21:05,879 --> 02:21:07,319
Yeah, pearly gates is going to look at you, Greg,

3243
02:21:07,319 --> 02:21:08,159
and he's going to be like, really?

3244
02:21:08,159 --> 02:21:09,319
The clown car?

3245
02:21:09,319 --> 02:21:10,159
Yeah.

3246
02:21:10,159 --> 02:21:15,829
There he goes.

3247
02:21:15,829 --> 02:21:16,829
It's so slow.

3248
02:21:18,229 --> 02:21:23,100
It's so slow.

3249
02:21:23,100 --> 02:21:23,940
Well, I thought they were going to just have

3250
02:21:23,940 --> 02:21:27,610
a little juice back there.

3251
02:21:27,610 --> 02:21:29,290
It really is slow.

3252
02:21:29,290 --> 02:21:30,930
Oh my gosh.

3253
02:21:30,930 --> 02:21:32,010
I thought it was running out of batteries.

3254
02:21:32,010 --> 02:21:32,850
I was like, oh shit,

3255
02:21:32,850 --> 02:21:33,930
it doesn't like run out of the batteries.

3256
02:21:33,930 --> 02:21:35,409
It has to go like 80 feet.

3257
02:21:37,690 --> 02:21:41,049
That's like the size of most kids' yards.

3258
02:21:41,049 --> 02:21:42,250
I almost ate shit there, by the way.

3259
02:21:42,250 --> 02:21:43,729
I almost tripped on the door.

3260
02:21:48,809 --> 02:21:49,969
He pooped his pants.

3261
02:21:52,780 --> 02:21:56,270
Did you guys talk about the rehearsal version of this scene?

3262
02:21:56,270 --> 02:21:58,909
Oh, the realistic diarrhea going into a toilet

3263
02:21:58,909 --> 02:22:00,389
real fully of a human shitting.

3264
02:22:00,389 --> 02:22:02,860
Yeah, we have.

3265
02:22:02,860 --> 02:22:06,180
I thought that I couldn't hear the effects.

3266
02:22:07,139 --> 02:22:10,739
But watching you guys spur the moment improv,

3267
02:22:10,739 --> 02:22:13,180
what it could have been was pretty wild.

3268
02:22:13,180 --> 02:22:16,020
It was pretty nuts.

3269
02:22:16,020 --> 02:22:18,899
Jeremy won't let us play the original clip.

3270
02:22:18,899 --> 02:22:19,739
Yeah.

3271
02:22:19,739 --> 02:22:21,260
He won't let you release the cut.

3272
02:22:21,260 --> 02:22:22,379
That's funny.

3273
02:22:22,379 --> 02:22:23,860
I don't release the cut.

3274
02:22:23,860 --> 02:22:25,670
You don't release the cut.

3275
02:22:25,670 --> 02:22:30,229
I remember hearing the sounds where I was.

3276
02:22:30,229 --> 02:22:31,629
I don't know if I could hear the sounds.

3277
02:22:31,629 --> 02:22:36,030
Maybe it's worse with all of the effects.

3278
02:22:36,069 --> 02:22:38,389
It'll be on the DVD extras.

3279
02:22:38,389 --> 02:22:40,270
The DVD extra.

3280
02:22:40,270 --> 02:22:42,270
Maybe after Jeremy retires, we'll leak it.

3281
02:22:44,989 --> 02:22:47,190
That's what sat you to limitation just goes away.

3282
02:22:47,190 --> 02:22:48,430
It was just fucked up.

3283
02:22:48,430 --> 02:22:50,229
It was just like a fucked up sequence.

3284
02:22:50,229 --> 02:22:53,670
I've sat in the toilet for four straight minutes

3285
02:22:53,670 --> 02:22:55,899
because we didn't have all the other stuff.

3286
02:22:55,899 --> 02:22:57,219
It was a nightmare.

3287
02:22:57,219 --> 02:23:00,299
You said, guys, what are we going to do if they pick nightmare?

3288
02:23:00,299 --> 02:23:02,659
And then you guys sort of improv'd

3289
02:23:02,659 --> 02:23:05,780
this terrifying nightmare scene.

3290
02:23:06,219 --> 02:23:08,180
Right after this, you're like, I did not like that.

3291
02:23:08,180 --> 02:23:09,540
And we're like, that's the point.

3292
02:23:09,540 --> 02:23:10,379
That's the point.

3293
02:23:10,379 --> 02:23:11,540
No, we didn't like that.

3294
02:23:11,540 --> 02:23:13,420
We're like, we can't do that.

3295
02:23:13,420 --> 02:23:15,500
I was like, I really didn't like that.

3296
02:23:15,500 --> 02:23:18,299
I don't want that in the show.

3297
02:23:18,299 --> 02:23:24,139
I didn't like it.

3298
02:23:24,139 --> 02:23:26,799
It was crazy.

3299
02:23:26,799 --> 02:23:28,079
What's your favorite moment?

3300
02:23:28,079 --> 02:23:32,280
My favorite moment?

3301
02:23:32,280 --> 02:23:34,079
I loved the dream sequence.

3302
02:23:34,079 --> 02:23:35,239
It was scary.

3303
02:23:35,239 --> 02:23:40,020
It was really scary, especially the rehearsal.

3304
02:23:40,020 --> 02:23:44,100
But then after watching back the one that aired,

3305
02:23:44,100 --> 02:23:48,819
it definitely was scarier than I realized in real time.

3306
02:23:48,819 --> 02:23:51,819
And so I think that was probably my favorite moment.

3307
02:23:51,819 --> 02:23:56,270
I think my second favorite moment was at the end,

3308
02:23:56,270 --> 02:24:00,430
after they decide to reset.

3309
02:24:00,430 --> 02:24:04,069
And we have one character after another after another

3310
02:24:04,069 --> 02:24:05,389
come into the scene.

3311
02:24:05,389 --> 02:24:08,110
And it's this callback to all these different characters

3312
02:24:08,110 --> 02:24:09,469
throughout the show.

3313
02:24:09,469 --> 02:24:11,110
And they're pleading with chat.

3314
02:24:11,110 --> 02:24:12,350
It's like, come on, guys.

3315
02:24:12,350 --> 02:24:13,149
It's time.

3316
02:24:13,149 --> 02:24:16,819
We got to do this.

3317
02:24:16,819 --> 02:24:17,780
You got to reset the game.

3318
02:24:17,780 --> 02:24:18,299
Stop it now.

3319
02:24:18,299 --> 02:24:18,819
We got to end it.

3320
02:24:18,819 --> 02:24:19,620
Yeah, exactly.

3321
02:24:19,620 --> 02:24:24,299
And the fact that chat really is the one that made it happen

3322
02:24:24,299 --> 02:24:30,510
and to complete the loop is just a really neat moment for me.

3323
02:24:30,510 --> 02:24:33,149
I 100% agree.

3324
02:24:33,149 --> 02:24:37,790
I also really loved, because originally, Edna.

3325
02:24:37,790 --> 02:24:39,469
We weren't sure who it was going to be,

3326
02:24:39,469 --> 02:24:42,069
because could we get that actual audio to work

3327
02:24:42,069 --> 02:24:45,430
and actually having you be able to be Edna with the voice

3328
02:24:45,430 --> 02:24:47,069
changer and actually have it work?

3329
02:24:47,069 --> 02:24:49,420
That was one of my favorite things of the week, too.

3330
02:24:49,420 --> 02:24:50,540
I love the cookies coming out.

3331
02:24:50,540 --> 02:24:55,549
I'm glad it worked, because when I do her voice,

3332
02:24:55,549 --> 02:25:00,620
normally I hear it in my headphones.

3333
02:25:00,620 --> 02:25:02,579
And I didn't there.

3334
02:25:02,579 --> 02:25:05,500
And so I didn't know if it was sounding correctly

3335
02:25:05,500 --> 02:25:06,340
the whole time.

3336
02:25:06,340 --> 02:25:11,260
And I was afraid, what if this sounds terrible?

3337
02:25:11,260 --> 02:25:13,139
Yeah, Kit, one of the things that Lauren and I

3338
02:25:13,180 --> 02:25:14,540
were talking about behind the scenes

3339
02:25:14,540 --> 02:25:17,340
and when we were planning all the different who should show up

3340
02:25:17,340 --> 02:25:21,500
and when, was your Edna character is so different

3341
02:25:21,500 --> 02:25:25,659
from every other character we had on the show.

3342
02:25:25,659 --> 02:25:29,899
Just energy and the comedy and just the way

3343
02:25:29,899 --> 02:25:33,180
the dynamic between Jerma and you in those scenes

3344
02:25:33,180 --> 02:25:34,180
was so different.

3345
02:25:34,180 --> 02:25:36,379
It felt like an awesome breath of fresh air.

3346
02:25:36,379 --> 02:25:37,219
I really enjoyed it.

3347
02:25:37,219 --> 02:25:38,100
It was so funny.

3348
02:25:38,100 --> 02:25:38,620
Yeah.

3349
02:25:38,620 --> 02:25:39,260
Oh, that's great.

3350
02:25:39,260 --> 02:25:40,870
It was perfect.

3351
02:25:40,870 --> 02:25:41,629
That's awesome.

3352
02:25:41,629 --> 02:25:46,260
I love when you went to the bathroom.

3353
02:25:46,260 --> 02:25:49,100
I was waiting for that.

3354
02:25:49,100 --> 02:25:50,139
Yeah, I was hoping.

3355
02:25:50,139 --> 02:25:52,219
I don't know what happened with the audio,

3356
02:25:52,219 --> 02:25:57,020
but I was hoping that you guys would do some goofy effects

3357
02:25:57,020 --> 02:25:57,940
with the audio there.

3358
02:25:57,940 --> 02:25:59,340
Yeah, they got their chance.

3359
02:25:59,340 --> 02:26:00,860
I think everybody got their sound effect

3360
02:26:00,860 --> 02:26:01,700
in the bathroom there.

3361
02:26:01,700 --> 02:26:03,420
OK, good.

3362
02:26:03,420 --> 02:26:06,440
Got at least one fart in.

3363
02:26:06,440 --> 02:26:08,920
Everybody got at least one bathroom gag.

3364
02:26:08,920 --> 02:26:11,120
So everyone got to fart or poop in the toilet,

3365
02:26:11,120 --> 02:26:15,030
which is kind of gross, but whatever.

3366
02:26:15,030 --> 02:26:19,020
That's how it goes.

3367
02:26:19,020 --> 02:26:20,739
I don't know if anyone talked about it yet,

3368
02:26:20,739 --> 02:26:23,979
but I don't think I'm the only one.

3369
02:26:23,979 --> 02:26:26,819
But there was something, sorry if this sounds cliche

3370
02:26:26,819 --> 02:26:28,979
or whatever, but there were a lot of moments

3371
02:26:28,979 --> 02:26:32,899
where Jerma walked around like a giddy little school

3372
02:26:32,899 --> 02:26:36,899
girl, really excited about particularly jumping

3373
02:26:36,899 --> 02:26:38,340
through the window.

3374
02:26:38,340 --> 02:26:44,420
But it was pretty cool to see, I don't know,

3375
02:26:44,420 --> 02:26:47,239
just the way you were watching it all come together

3376
02:26:47,239 --> 02:26:50,120
and just living it out.

3377
02:26:50,120 --> 02:26:51,840
It was pretty wild.

3378
02:26:51,840 --> 02:26:54,120
I actually, I have this clip of Jeremy

3379
02:26:54,120 --> 02:26:56,120
seeing the house for the first time

3380
02:26:56,120 --> 02:26:58,760
inside the trailer where we had the graphic.

3381
02:26:58,760 --> 02:27:00,200
Oh, the cut up from the cut away.

3382
02:27:00,200 --> 02:27:02,440
With the graphic overlay, yeah.

3383
02:27:02,440 --> 02:27:05,620
She's like walking around in there.

3384
02:27:05,620 --> 02:27:09,260
It looks like a sign film.

3385
02:27:09,260 --> 02:27:10,659
You disappear between the rooms.

3386
02:27:10,659 --> 02:27:12,899
I'm just imagining like, oh, Jeremy.

3387
02:27:12,899 --> 02:27:14,260
It's like Kramer Dunford.

3388
02:27:14,260 --> 02:27:15,899
Yeah, like this is ridiculous.

3389
02:27:15,940 --> 02:27:16,940
That's insane.

3390
02:27:21,399 --> 02:27:23,520
Well, I want to like do the stream now.

3391
02:27:23,520 --> 02:27:24,360
You know what I mean?

3392
02:27:24,360 --> 02:27:26,200
I just want to like start it.

3393
02:27:26,200 --> 02:27:27,440
God, this is awesome.

3394
02:27:27,440 --> 02:27:28,280
I really did.

3395
02:27:28,280 --> 02:27:30,319
Yeah, you were so excited.

3396
02:27:32,319 --> 02:27:35,760
Just so many props back there and just like.

3397
02:27:35,760 --> 02:27:36,920
Well, it's just awesome to see something

3398
02:27:36,920 --> 02:27:38,120
like this come together.

3399
02:27:38,120 --> 02:27:43,430
It just, never in my wildest dreams that I think that,

3400
02:27:43,430 --> 02:27:47,500
and I was making TF2 YouTube videos like 10 years ago

3401
02:27:47,500 --> 02:27:49,500
and it's like, we were able to put this together

3402
02:27:49,500 --> 02:27:50,340
and do this now.

3403
02:27:50,340 --> 02:27:53,879
It's just, I never would have thought this was ever possible.

3404
02:27:53,879 --> 02:27:55,959
So watching, being able to actually like go and play

3405
02:27:55,959 --> 02:27:58,500
with the giant toy that was made

3406
02:27:58,500 --> 02:28:02,020
with 30, 40 plus people that had involvement in it.

3407
02:28:02,020 --> 02:28:03,829
It was just, it was surreal.

3408
02:28:03,829 --> 02:28:04,909
It was a surreal experience

3409
02:28:04,909 --> 02:28:09,459
and I will never forget it until the day I die.

3410
02:28:09,459 --> 02:28:11,340
Yeah, I think it carried over for us too.

3411
02:28:11,340 --> 02:28:13,659
Like you had definitely an infectious energy

3412
02:28:13,659 --> 02:28:16,389
and just, you know, the kids had excitement

3413
02:28:16,389 --> 02:28:18,829
like seeing you just kind of dive into every scene

3414
02:28:18,829 --> 02:28:21,750
and just live it, made it a lot easier for all of us

3415
02:28:21,750 --> 02:28:25,829
to like wrap around how your dynamic was

3416
02:28:25,829 --> 02:28:28,250
and I think it definitely showed,

3417
02:28:28,250 --> 02:28:31,090
especially like, you know, the second and third day,

3418
02:28:31,090 --> 02:28:33,530
I think like, first day being the test,

3419
02:28:33,530 --> 02:28:35,129
I think by second and third day,

3420
02:28:35,129 --> 02:28:40,180
we really hit our stride and it really turned out great.

3421
02:28:40,180 --> 02:28:41,340
Yeah, I could, I literally couldn't be happier.

3422
02:28:41,340 --> 02:28:42,870
You're just super positive.

3423
02:28:42,870 --> 02:28:45,790
You're so, I asked you maybe 17 times after it ended

3424
02:28:45,790 --> 02:28:46,629
what you thought about the ending

3425
02:28:46,629 --> 02:28:48,030
because I felt a lot of pressure

3426
02:28:48,030 --> 02:28:51,229
because it, you know, it involved a lot of me and Amelia.

3427
02:28:51,270 --> 02:28:52,590
So I was like, man, I hope he liked that

3428
02:28:52,590 --> 02:28:55,549
because you had planned day two ending so precisely,

3429
02:28:55,549 --> 02:28:58,069
day three ending was like, I don't know what's gonna happen.

3430
02:28:58,069 --> 02:29:00,389
We're just, we're gonna figure it out

3431
02:29:00,389 --> 02:29:03,190
and so I asked him like, I think like 17 times,

3432
02:29:03,190 --> 02:29:04,030
like, what do you think?

3433
02:29:04,030 --> 02:29:04,870
Like, how was it?

3434
02:29:04,870 --> 02:29:05,870
He's like, oh, it was great.

3435
02:29:05,870 --> 02:29:06,750
Oh, it was perfect.

3436
02:29:06,750 --> 02:29:08,190
Oh, it couldn't have been better

3437
02:29:08,190 --> 02:29:09,829
and I was like, oh, great

3438
02:29:09,829 --> 02:29:12,510
and I kept asking because I just felt so self-conscious

3439
02:29:12,510 --> 02:29:14,530
at all times.

3440
02:29:14,530 --> 02:29:15,370
Yeah.

3441
02:29:15,370 --> 02:29:16,569
You guys were unbelievable.

3442
02:29:16,569 --> 02:29:17,969
You guys were hilarious.

3443
02:29:17,969 --> 02:29:18,809
You were funny.

3444
02:29:18,809 --> 02:29:21,569
You could just implant yourself anywhere

3445
02:29:21,569 --> 02:29:23,409
and that's why you were on the show to begin with.

3446
02:29:23,409 --> 02:29:25,010
That was part of it, right?

3447
02:29:25,010 --> 02:29:28,690
Is I've watched your streams, all of you guys here

3448
02:29:28,690 --> 02:29:31,010
and you can do it.

3449
02:29:31,010 --> 02:29:33,729
I couldn't have asked for like a better,

3450
02:29:33,729 --> 02:29:38,200
like cast and crew and it was unbelievable.

3451
02:29:38,200 --> 02:29:40,120
I don't wanna get emotional.

3452
02:29:40,120 --> 02:29:41,440
I promised I wouldn't get emotional

3453
02:29:41,440 --> 02:29:43,079
on the behind the scenes stream.

3454
02:29:43,079 --> 02:29:46,319
I promised I wouldn't.

3455
02:29:46,319 --> 02:29:48,239
This is the kind of shit that I wanna do more of.

3456
02:29:48,239 --> 02:29:50,000
I wanna see more of this stuff

3457
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:53,860
and I think that over the coming years,

3458
02:29:53,860 --> 02:29:55,850
let's keep doing them.

3459
02:29:56,649 --> 02:29:57,610
I think that there's a lot of potential

3460
02:29:57,610 --> 02:30:00,090
to keep kind of trying to just do fun stuff

3461
02:30:00,090 --> 02:30:01,290
and just try, right?

3462
02:30:01,290 --> 02:30:04,489
Because look, this could have been a fucking disaster.

3463
02:30:04,489 --> 02:30:07,290
This could have been the shittiest stream on Twitch.

3464
02:30:07,290 --> 02:30:09,409
Yeah, but it happened, right?

3465
02:30:09,409 --> 02:30:10,250
That's what I was thinking

3466
02:30:10,250 --> 02:30:11,969
when I was hyperventilating in my car an hour

3467
02:30:11,969 --> 02:30:13,969
before we started the stream on Wednesday.

3468
02:30:13,969 --> 02:30:19,299
This could have been just an absolute fucking train wreck

3469
02:30:19,299 --> 02:30:21,020
but you try.

3470
02:30:21,020 --> 02:30:22,940
You try to do something that you think is fun.

3471
02:30:22,940 --> 02:30:23,780
That's it.

3472
02:30:23,780 --> 02:30:25,879
Yeah.

3473
02:30:25,879 --> 02:30:28,600
Thanks to everybody who participated,

3474
02:30:28,600 --> 02:30:32,559
to Kit, to Ludwig, to Kraikin, to Milton,

3475
02:30:32,559 --> 02:30:35,899
to Micah, to Randy, obviously to Ray

3476
02:30:35,899 --> 02:30:37,579
for bearing that costume.

3477
02:30:37,579 --> 02:30:39,700
I feel so bad for him.

3478
02:30:39,700 --> 02:30:41,659
Bearing the costume.

3479
02:30:41,659 --> 02:30:44,219
There were so many just superheroes of the week

3480
02:30:44,219 --> 02:30:46,260
that it'd be impossible to kind of,

3481
02:30:46,260 --> 02:30:47,739
it was everybody.

3482
02:30:47,739 --> 02:30:49,500
Everybody had this thing that they were doing.

3483
02:30:49,500 --> 02:30:51,459
This is like the thing that's really to know

3484
02:30:51,459 --> 02:30:53,219
and why at the end of the stream it was like,

3485
02:30:53,219 --> 02:30:54,059
get everybody on here

3486
02:30:54,100 --> 02:30:56,959
because if you were on set as,

3487
02:30:56,959 --> 02:31:00,639
oh, I'm a, you know, I'm a fuck, I'm the audio guy.

3488
02:31:00,639 --> 02:31:02,360
Like you did like three or four other things

3489
02:31:02,360 --> 02:31:04,440
that were not just I'm the audio guy.

3490
02:31:04,440 --> 02:31:07,479
If you were, oh, I was putting the Tress up.

3491
02:31:07,479 --> 02:31:08,559
Did I say that right, Tress?

3492
02:31:08,559 --> 02:31:10,020
Yeah.

3493
02:31:10,020 --> 02:31:11,940
Like some of these people were actors.

3494
02:31:11,940 --> 02:31:14,139
Some of the people were like the shadow people.

3495
02:31:14,139 --> 02:31:16,299
People had like three or four different roles

3496
02:31:16,299 --> 02:31:18,340
that weren't just the thing that they came to show up.

3497
02:31:18,340 --> 02:31:21,620
Vinny, the editor, he was supposed to just come

3498
02:31:21,620 --> 02:31:23,459
and take video for the behind the scenes shit

3499
02:31:23,459 --> 02:31:25,940
and he did like seven people's jobs.

3500
02:31:25,940 --> 02:31:27,760
It was ridiculous.

3501
02:31:27,760 --> 02:31:30,670
So it's impossible without all the people

3502
02:31:30,670 --> 02:31:33,090
that got to do, hopefully had a lot of fun

3503
02:31:33,090 --> 02:31:34,690
and got to do multiple things

3504
02:31:34,690 --> 02:31:39,110
that they thought were interesting.

3505
02:31:39,110 --> 02:31:41,549
I think this is probably a good place to end it

3506
02:31:41,549 --> 02:31:44,270
unless, Jeremy, did you want to take one or two questions

3507
02:31:44,270 --> 02:31:46,549
from chat for our guests?

3508
02:31:46,549 --> 02:31:48,629
I think we should take a couple if we can.

3509
02:31:48,629 --> 02:31:49,709
Yeah, that'd be great.

3510
02:31:49,709 --> 02:31:50,989
So if you've got questions from the chat-

3511
02:31:50,989 --> 02:31:52,430
Especially with Kit and Ludwig here.

3512
02:31:52,430 --> 02:31:56,430
Yeah, you should add Kit, add Ludwig, add Kraikin, add-

3513
02:31:56,950 --> 02:32:00,149
Jeremy, if you have a specific question for one of them

3514
02:32:00,149 --> 02:32:02,819
and we-

3515
02:32:02,819 --> 02:32:03,899
How hot was it on set?

3516
02:32:03,899 --> 02:32:07,969
How hot was it on set?

3517
02:32:07,969 --> 02:32:09,450
It was a perfect temperature.

3518
02:32:09,450 --> 02:32:10,579
It was fine.

3519
02:32:10,579 --> 02:32:13,700
Unless you wore like the bear costume,

3520
02:32:13,700 --> 02:32:15,819
Ludwig says it's hot.

3521
02:32:15,819 --> 02:32:17,620
He doesn't think so.

3522
02:32:17,620 --> 02:32:21,059
It got a bit toasty, like, well, I got to like get off.

3523
02:32:21,059 --> 02:32:23,139
I got to like relax in the green room.

3524
02:32:23,139 --> 02:32:24,579
But when I had to take over for a bit

3525
02:32:24,579 --> 02:32:26,219
and like lie down there,

3526
02:32:26,219 --> 02:32:27,780
especially when you're doing something physical

3527
02:32:27,780 --> 02:32:30,040
and you start sweating, I don't know.

3528
02:32:30,280 --> 02:32:32,649
You were a trooper, that was hot.

3529
02:32:32,649 --> 02:32:36,209
Oh, physically on in the dollhouse was hot, yeah.

3530
02:32:36,209 --> 02:32:37,049
Yeah.

3531
02:32:37,049 --> 02:32:39,010
But like being able to like get out of that room.

3532
02:32:39,010 --> 02:32:40,329
And I did a few times too.

3533
02:32:40,329 --> 02:32:42,729
A lot of the times when it went to the,

3534
02:32:42,729 --> 02:32:44,610
kind of the transition sequence

3535
02:32:44,610 --> 02:32:47,409
where it was buying something and here's like an ad.

3536
02:32:47,409 --> 02:32:48,969
I got up and I was able to get out of there

3537
02:32:48,969 --> 02:32:50,889
and just kind of get some water, walk around.

3538
02:32:50,889 --> 02:32:52,889
So I wasn't just like stuck in there permanently,

3539
02:32:52,889 --> 02:32:55,139
but yeah, it was pretty warm in there.

3540
02:32:55,139 --> 02:32:56,579
It was an air conditioned facility,

3541
02:32:56,579 --> 02:32:58,059
which makes a big difference too.

3542
02:32:58,059 --> 02:32:59,500
Like even though it was hot in the set,

3543
02:32:59,500 --> 02:33:02,290
it was that much cooler than it would have been

3544
02:33:02,290 --> 02:33:03,209
because we were fortunate

3545
02:33:03,209 --> 02:33:05,659
that the facility was somewhat air conditioned.

3546
02:33:05,659 --> 02:33:08,459
We then put hundreds and hundreds of pounds of curtains

3547
02:33:08,459 --> 02:33:09,579
in front of the air conditioner,

3548
02:33:09,579 --> 02:33:12,780
but it was still air conditioned.

3549
02:33:12,780 --> 02:33:15,500
I've got a question here for Kit and Jeremy.

3550
02:33:15,500 --> 02:33:21,360
Talk about the pink paint, pink, pink, paint.

3551
02:33:21,360 --> 02:33:22,520
Pink?

3552
02:33:22,520 --> 02:33:25,850
I think he hadn't, he was using an accent, right?

3553
02:33:25,850 --> 02:33:26,690
And I'm saying pink.

3554
02:33:26,690 --> 02:33:29,500
I think I was doing something like that.

3555
02:33:29,500 --> 02:33:32,120
I guess I must've said pink.

3556
02:33:32,120 --> 02:33:34,479
I must've said pink or something.

3557
02:33:34,479 --> 02:33:37,120
And then I heard that back in production

3558
02:33:37,120 --> 02:33:38,959
and I was like, did you say pink?

3559
02:33:38,959 --> 02:33:41,680
And so I was like, I just made a notification

3560
02:33:41,680 --> 02:33:43,959
of like minus 20 bucks for pink, pink.

3561
02:33:43,959 --> 02:33:47,360
And then that was the notification at the top.

3562
02:33:47,360 --> 02:33:52,379
Oh, I don't know if I was saying it for paint or pink.

3563
02:33:52,379 --> 02:33:53,219
Yeah, who knows?

3564
02:33:53,219 --> 02:33:55,379
I think you said pink, pink.

3565
02:33:55,379 --> 02:33:58,700
Yeah, pink, pink, pink, pink, pink, pink.

3566
02:33:58,700 --> 02:34:00,260
And then I called it pink, pink.

3567
02:34:01,620 --> 02:34:02,780
And then we're like,

3568
02:34:02,819 --> 02:34:05,219
we're telling Blair to tell Jeremy

3569
02:34:05,219 --> 02:34:06,860
to bring up the pink thing.

3570
02:34:06,860 --> 02:34:08,180
And you must've been so confused

3571
02:34:08,180 --> 02:34:12,129
why you were being told to call it pink.

3572
02:34:12,129 --> 02:34:12,969
I had no idea what was going on.

3573
02:34:12,969 --> 02:34:14,969
I was like, hey, bring up pink.

3574
02:34:14,969 --> 02:34:15,809
And I'm like, what?

3575
02:34:15,809 --> 02:34:16,809
I was like, what is pink?

3576
02:34:16,809 --> 02:34:17,649
What are you talking about?

3577
02:34:17,649 --> 02:34:20,340
I didn't know what to say.

3578
02:34:20,340 --> 02:34:23,579
I thought it was like a bit that Jeb had.

3579
02:34:23,579 --> 02:34:27,270
Like, oh, he's gonna do this pink thing.

3580
02:34:27,270 --> 02:34:28,110
Not really.

3581
02:34:28,110 --> 02:34:32,430
I tried to, some of the voices and characters I did

3582
02:34:32,430 --> 02:34:36,739
had a little bit of like lore from some of the scam calls,

3583
02:34:36,739 --> 02:34:41,319
but I tried to just mostly focus on the dollhouse,

3584
02:34:41,319 --> 02:34:43,420
so I didn't really bring anything over.

3585
02:34:43,420 --> 02:34:45,649
Excuse me, Jeb.

3586
02:34:45,649 --> 02:34:46,969
I missed that.

3587
02:34:46,969 --> 02:34:48,690
I missed so many references.

3588
02:34:48,690 --> 02:34:50,409
You love saying Jeb.

3589
02:34:52,209 --> 02:34:54,250
Not a single time.

3590
02:34:54,250 --> 02:34:56,260
He did Jeb.

3591
02:34:56,260 --> 02:34:57,260
I just kept doing it.

3592
02:34:57,260 --> 02:34:58,780
I just kept going, oh, Jeb.

3593
02:34:58,780 --> 02:35:00,219
Yeah, excuse me, Jeb.

3594
02:35:00,219 --> 02:35:01,420
Jeb is a mess.

3595
02:35:01,979 --> 02:35:06,700
I think, honestly, I really think I said that probably 30 to 40 times,

3596
02:35:06,700 --> 02:35:07,540
at least.

3597
02:35:07,540 --> 02:35:12,059
In hindsight, yeah.

3598
02:35:12,059 --> 02:35:14,700
I saw someone ask about, oh, go ahead.

3599
02:35:14,700 --> 02:35:16,530
No, go ahead.

3600
02:35:16,530 --> 02:35:22,780
Someone asked about the Jerma inviting Edna to the party,

3601
02:35:22,780 --> 02:35:26,510
which you had mentioned previously in a different segment,

3602
02:35:26,510 --> 02:35:30,989
which, I mean, yeah, the quick statement was just,

3603
02:35:30,989 --> 02:35:33,030
I was suited up as the police officer

3604
02:35:33,030 --> 02:35:36,430
because I think Ludwig was going to talk to me or something.

3605
02:35:36,430 --> 02:35:39,690
There was some storyline progression,

3606
02:35:39,690 --> 02:35:43,479
and then Jerma said, I want to invite Edna to the party,

3607
02:35:43,479 --> 02:35:47,280
and so I just had to switch.

3608
02:35:47,280 --> 02:35:48,760
I ran all the way back,

3609
02:35:48,760 --> 02:35:54,000
and at one point was like taking my clothes off in the green room.

3610
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,760
I think you still had the lipstick on as the police officer.

3611
02:35:56,760 --> 02:35:59,399
Yeah, the cop had lipstick on when he came back out, it was amazing.

3612
02:35:59,399 --> 02:36:02,690
You still had the lipstick.

3613
02:36:02,690 --> 02:36:04,129
Everyone told me to do that.

3614
02:36:04,129 --> 02:36:05,129
I was going to take it off.

3615
02:36:05,129 --> 02:36:06,329
I was like, no, it's funny.

3616
02:36:06,329 --> 02:36:08,329
OK.

3617
02:36:08,329 --> 02:36:10,170
Is there a video on the second floor?

3618
02:36:10,170 --> 02:36:15,250
Ludwig and Kraken, someone in chat wants to know about the good dream.

3619
02:36:15,250 --> 02:36:19,610
What would have happened with the good dream?

3620
02:36:19,610 --> 02:36:22,209
We brainstormed a couple of things.

3621
02:36:22,209 --> 02:36:25,110
I don't think we like...

3622
02:36:25,110 --> 02:36:26,670
I think it was like I was a cowboy,

3623
02:36:26,670 --> 02:36:30,149
so some sort of like cool cowboy maybe fights like a gladiator

3624
02:36:30,149 --> 02:36:31,829
because we had a gladiator costume.

3625
02:36:31,829 --> 02:36:35,540
Yeah, just something like random, but like, you know, maybe cooler

3626
02:36:35,540 --> 02:36:36,620
or badass.

3627
02:36:36,620 --> 02:36:39,059
We also played around with like kind of like a sexy dream,

3628
02:36:39,059 --> 02:36:43,180
where like, you know, it was kind of like he was being puppeted around.

3629
02:36:43,180 --> 02:36:47,420
And like, there's also a version of it, I think, where we had the same kitchen

3630
02:36:47,420 --> 02:36:50,659
thing where everyone was like laughing at him, but there's instead like cheering

3631
02:36:50,659 --> 02:36:53,180
for him. So it's like a version of that dream.

3632
02:36:53,180 --> 02:36:56,350
But like, everyone's, you know, happy to see him.

3633
02:36:56,350 --> 02:36:58,469
You're the greatest, you're so wonderful.

3634
02:36:58,469 --> 02:37:00,549
Weren't they congratulating you on a good poop?

3635
02:37:00,549 --> 02:37:05,700
Yeah, it was like the end of the Evangelion scene,

3636
02:37:05,700 --> 02:37:09,020
but you just pooped and everyone was there and like, congratulations.

3637
02:37:09,379 --> 02:37:11,500
You're like, we're so proud of you.

3638
02:37:11,500 --> 02:37:14,860
Yeah, yeah, I think that's because they told us when we were going in the kitchen

3639
02:37:14,860 --> 02:37:18,510
that, yeah, whether it was good or bad, we would find out

3640
02:37:18,709 --> 02:37:23,780
and that we were either to cheer and say good job or make fun of them. Yeah. Yeah.

3641
02:37:26,409 --> 02:37:28,530
Another question for Ludwig,

3642
02:37:28,530 --> 02:37:32,129
but I guess probably also very applicable to Kit is when did

3643
02:37:33,250 --> 02:37:35,329
when did you get involved with the project?

3644
02:37:35,850 --> 02:37:36,969
Like, how did that happen?

3645
02:37:36,969 --> 02:37:39,850
And are you open to further collaborations?

3646
02:37:42,180 --> 02:37:44,879
Um, Kate, you run it first.

3647
02:37:47,659 --> 02:37:49,540
I would never want to work with it.

3648
02:37:49,540 --> 02:37:53,899
No, I, I don't prefer.

3649
02:37:55,180 --> 02:37:58,340
Yeah, after this, I will never speak to you.

3650
02:38:00,610 --> 02:38:04,090
Yeah, I would be delighted to do anything with any of you.

3651
02:38:04,129 --> 02:38:06,450
It was a blast. I will never forget it.

3652
02:38:07,760 --> 02:38:09,540
Tons of great,

3653
02:38:09,540 --> 02:38:12,100
improv moments and like Ludwig, you had mentioned

3654
02:38:13,469 --> 02:38:19,020
just being able to vibe his vibe, a word that kids use vibe off of each other

3655
02:38:19,180 --> 02:38:21,860
and come up younger by the day.

3656
02:38:22,459 --> 02:38:25,739
Yeah. Come up with ideas.

3657
02:38:25,739 --> 02:38:27,739
Seeing Ludwig's hair in real life.

3658
02:38:27,739 --> 02:38:28,819
There was lots of good moments.

3659
02:38:28,819 --> 02:38:34,530
But the I think it was a couple.

3660
02:38:34,569 --> 02:38:36,690
You gave me a couple of months notice.

3661
02:38:36,690 --> 02:38:39,889
I think Jerma and Jake, you guys, like,

3662
02:38:40,209 --> 02:38:45,799
DMed me on Discord and said, hey, we're thinking about a dollhouse thing.

3663
02:38:45,799 --> 02:38:46,920
Would you be interested?

3664
02:38:46,920 --> 02:38:48,719
And you didn't give me a ton of detail.

3665
02:38:48,719 --> 02:38:54,639
I just said, yeah, I think I gave you a call in like maybe March or April

3666
02:38:54,959 --> 02:38:59,399
because I saw your name on the whiteboard there from the meeting that we had in May.

3667
02:39:00,360 --> 02:39:02,879
Oh, yeah. And you were you were you were pretty well

3668
02:39:03,280 --> 02:39:05,840
like it was a known you were a known quantity at that point.

3669
02:39:05,840 --> 02:39:09,159
So then you did give me quite a bit of notice.

3670
02:39:09,360 --> 02:39:11,840
We didn't maybe we didn't really hash out

3671
02:39:11,840 --> 02:39:15,000
or didn't know exactly what it was, but you had mentioned.

3672
02:39:15,319 --> 02:39:20,260
Yeah. What do you want to tell the story of your involvement?

3673
02:39:21,860 --> 02:39:25,139
I don't know. I forget exactly what I weaseled my way into Jerma's life

3674
02:39:25,139 --> 02:39:28,100
and force him out of his twitch cavern that he hides in.

3675
02:39:29,459 --> 02:39:34,040
But I think it was some time because like the battleship thing we did

3676
02:39:34,479 --> 02:39:38,520
and then the tournament, I think it was right around then that you asked.

3677
02:39:40,409 --> 02:39:42,209
And it was like it was like twofold.

3678
02:39:42,209 --> 02:39:46,200
It was like one, you're like, hey, that was great.

3679
02:39:46,239 --> 02:39:48,000
Like that was that was that was fun.

3680
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:50,479
Hey, totally random. I have this thing going on.

3681
02:39:50,959 --> 02:39:52,399
And then I was like, yeah, it sounds great.

3682
02:39:52,399 --> 02:39:55,040
And then like a day later later, you're like, by the way, for like

3683
02:39:55,479 --> 02:39:57,600
you happen to have a sponsor, too.

3684
02:39:57,600 --> 02:40:01,760
And I'm like, this is all right.

3685
02:40:01,760 --> 02:40:03,399
Let him show why I call it.

3686
02:40:03,399 --> 02:40:06,639
I was just curious. I was just curious. I was just curious.

3687
02:40:07,379 --> 02:40:12,440
Yeah. Yeah. And we were so I was I was like, yeah,

3688
02:40:12,440 --> 02:40:16,120
I was instantly down because and I think you're surprised.

3689
02:40:16,120 --> 02:40:18,569
Were you surprised?

3690
02:40:18,569 --> 02:40:22,329
Well, because I think it's because it was yeah, it was it was such short notice

3691
02:40:22,809 --> 02:40:24,729
because it was like I think two or three weeks out from the show.

3692
02:40:24,729 --> 02:40:27,659
And I'm like, he's probably got a lot of shit going on.

3693
02:40:27,659 --> 02:40:30,540
You probably look, I understand you have to treat this travel involved.

3694
02:40:31,059 --> 02:40:32,100
If you don't, I understand.

3695
02:40:32,100 --> 02:40:33,459
And you're just like, no, I'm game.

3696
02:40:33,459 --> 02:40:36,600
I'm like, you're game.

3697
02:40:36,600 --> 02:40:38,559
All right. This is perfect.

3698
02:40:38,559 --> 02:40:40,559
Cool. Yeah. Come on.

3699
02:40:40,559 --> 02:40:42,340
You mentioned Ludwig.

3700
02:40:42,340 --> 02:40:45,700
I at first assumed it was like a different Ludwig

3701
02:40:45,700 --> 02:40:47,100
that I didn't know of.

3702
02:40:47,100 --> 02:40:50,139
No, that's a different one.

3703
02:40:50,979 --> 02:40:53,899
We got like a celebrity impersonator.

3704
02:40:55,469 --> 02:40:57,180
Celebrity impersonator.

3705
02:40:57,180 --> 02:41:00,899
Oh, that's really pretty funny, though.

3706
02:41:01,579 --> 02:41:05,059
Yeah, like an impersonator of just like a different streamer.

3707
02:41:05,059 --> 02:41:06,579
Oh, but like a doctor.

3708
02:41:06,579 --> 02:41:09,370
I think I'm actually the doc.

3709
02:41:09,370 --> 02:41:10,690
Just the hair and the mustache.

3710
02:41:10,690 --> 02:41:13,079
Terrible. Yeah.

3711
02:41:13,120 --> 02:41:16,280
But honestly, it was after we did the battleship stuff

3712
02:41:16,899 --> 02:41:20,020
when you and I did the battleship thing back and forth with, you know, the shirt

3713
02:41:20,020 --> 02:41:22,059
that, you know, maybe one day I'll do that.

3714
02:41:22,829 --> 02:41:23,549
I'm probably not, though.

3715
02:41:23,549 --> 02:41:26,489
Hopefully not. You just don't know.

3716
02:41:26,489 --> 02:41:28,850
I'll buy it. We had a blast.

3717
02:41:28,850 --> 02:41:31,930
Like the thing with like kind of collabing with people and stuff.

3718
02:41:31,930 --> 02:41:36,030
And I have to like mesh with somebody.

3719
02:41:36,030 --> 02:41:36,549
You know what I mean?

3720
02:41:36,549 --> 02:41:40,790
And during those streams, I was like, this is fun.

3721
02:41:40,829 --> 02:41:42,870
These are bouncing back and forth.

3722
02:41:42,870 --> 02:41:43,870
He's a funny motherfucker.

3723
02:41:43,870 --> 02:41:45,790
I like this dude a lot.

3724
02:41:45,790 --> 02:41:48,870
So it was really, really simple to like reach out to you

3725
02:41:49,190 --> 02:41:50,750
because it was just like, oh, that was great.

3726
02:41:50,750 --> 02:41:51,909
Because you never want to have a scenario, right?

3727
02:41:51,909 --> 02:41:54,270
Will you? It's tricky to.

3728
02:41:54,940 --> 02:41:57,420
Oh, let's let's ask this person if they want to be involved.

3729
02:41:57,899 --> 02:42:00,049
Never speaking to. I've never talked to them.

3730
02:42:00,049 --> 02:42:01,489
Don't know what their what their deal is.

3731
02:42:01,489 --> 02:42:04,370
I have no idea how they how they are, how they are off camera.

3732
02:42:04,370 --> 02:42:05,649
Are they somebody I would mesh with?

3733
02:42:05,649 --> 02:42:07,250
And then you get in the same room we get on camera.

3734
02:42:07,250 --> 02:42:09,520
It's like, are you ready?

3735
02:42:09,520 --> 02:42:12,200
You're going to do like the show that, you know, a guy that I don't know

3736
02:42:12,200 --> 02:42:14,559
that I never talked to, do I have any chemistry with?

3737
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:16,280
I don't like doing that. Yeah.

3738
02:42:16,280 --> 02:42:17,809
So, yeah.

3739
02:42:17,809 --> 02:42:19,489
Craig, do you want to talk? It's very simple.

3740
02:42:19,489 --> 02:42:21,250
Do you want to talk for a quick second about Ghost Commander

3741
02:42:21,250 --> 02:42:23,569
and your involvement, how that kind of went down?

3742
02:42:24,170 --> 02:42:25,049
Maybe plug your stuff.

3743
02:42:25,049 --> 02:42:31,010
I mean, as I mentioned earlier, we like I've known Jeremy for a few years now

3744
02:42:32,250 --> 02:42:35,489
since we did like role play stuff in games almost in a while.

3745
02:42:36,370 --> 02:42:39,770
And then at one of the Twitch cons, we started talking about,

3746
02:42:40,090 --> 02:42:42,530
you know, ambitious projects we had at that point.

3747
02:42:42,530 --> 02:42:45,010
I had started Ghost Commander with Lauren.

3748
02:42:45,530 --> 02:42:47,049
It's basically our interactive

3749
02:42:48,860 --> 02:42:49,819
Twitch production company.

3750
02:42:49,819 --> 02:42:56,139
So we build both technology and shows that are like, you know, viewer integrated.

3751
02:42:56,420 --> 02:42:58,659
And so I was telling him about some of the stuff that we were working on.

3752
02:42:58,659 --> 02:43:01,700
And he was like, oh, I had this idea for, you know, a dollhouse show or like,

3753
02:43:01,700 --> 02:43:04,780
you know, I play like basically a sim in a house.

3754
02:43:04,780 --> 02:43:07,420
And so we started shooting the shit and like, oh, this sounds really fun.

3755
02:43:07,420 --> 02:43:09,620
We'd love to collaborate on this should it ever happen.

3756
02:43:09,620 --> 02:43:11,459
But then, like, you know, two years later,

3757
02:43:12,579 --> 02:43:15,299
you guys managed to secure the money and you called me back up

3758
02:43:15,299 --> 02:43:18,620
and you're like, all right, I think we want to we want to actually explore

3759
02:43:18,620 --> 02:43:19,899
how we could do this.

3760
02:43:19,899 --> 02:43:24,860
And so we, you know, hopped on a plane and went out to see what we could do.

3761
02:43:24,860 --> 02:43:26,860
And that's kind of how the whole brainstorm happened

3762
02:43:26,860 --> 02:43:29,200
and then built the whole thing over the next couple of months.

3763
02:43:29,200 --> 02:43:33,729
And here we are. So and make no mistake about it.

3764
02:43:33,729 --> 02:43:37,829
The without the Ghost Commander team and without the extension,

3765
02:43:38,809 --> 02:43:41,209
we can't do the stream. The stream doesn't even work.

3766
02:43:41,729 --> 02:43:44,450
We like can't even physically go live without having that.

3767
02:43:44,530 --> 02:43:48,180
So it was the catalyst to even be able to do it in the first place.

3768
02:43:48,299 --> 02:43:50,829
So forever grateful. Thank you.

3769
02:43:50,829 --> 02:43:53,670
Yeah. I mean, if you want any other time, like the cool thing

3770
02:43:53,670 --> 02:43:57,110
that what we're building is every one of these shows we do, we're like

3771
02:43:57,709 --> 02:44:02,629
our code base gets like stronger and we have more learned knowledge.

3772
02:44:02,629 --> 02:44:07,180
So now that we've done this, like we know how to like balance an economy

3773
02:44:07,180 --> 02:44:10,579
for like a hundred thousand people, which, by the way,

3774
02:44:11,379 --> 02:44:14,780
I don't know if you've shared any of I mean, we we've been looking at

3775
02:44:14,780 --> 02:44:18,139
some of the records of the extension usage and we broke Twitch records.

3776
02:44:19,340 --> 02:44:22,059
We there were more people using the extension than chatting.

3777
02:44:23,190 --> 02:44:25,340
And holy shit. Whoa.

3778
02:44:25,340 --> 02:44:31,540
Yeah. It was north of like 65 percent of the viewership was

3779
02:44:31,700 --> 02:44:36,299
was using the extension to click on stuff, which is not a thing.

3780
02:44:37,780 --> 02:44:41,940
Yeah. So we're we're overjoyed that it went so well.

3781
02:44:41,940 --> 02:44:45,780
And it's also put us in a cool position to be able to work on

3782
02:44:47,450 --> 02:44:50,450
more stuff like this, you know, both with you and with other streamers

3783
02:44:50,450 --> 02:44:52,170
and whoever really wants to.

3784
02:44:52,170 --> 02:44:55,969
So yeah, it was the scariest thing.

3785
02:44:55,969 --> 02:44:58,129
I think like a week before the show,

3786
02:44:58,129 --> 02:45:00,889
we were in a call and you guys were showing the extension.

3787
02:45:00,889 --> 02:45:03,370
And you're just kind of like it was like a it was done,

3788
02:45:03,370 --> 02:45:05,290
but there was still a couple more things you had left to do.

3789
02:45:05,290 --> 02:45:06,530
I think I asked a hundred times.

3790
02:45:06,530 --> 02:45:07,770
I was like, so is this going to work?

3791
02:45:07,770 --> 02:45:10,610
Is this is this what if what if what if this happens?

3792
02:45:10,809 --> 02:45:12,569
Is it going to break? What if it breaks?

3793
02:45:12,569 --> 02:45:14,450
What if we do this? What happens if it breaks?

3794
02:45:14,450 --> 02:45:16,729
And you're like, no, it's it's going to be good, man.

3795
02:45:16,969 --> 02:45:18,250
It's not going to break.

3796
02:45:18,250 --> 02:45:19,850
And I was like, what if it breaks?

3797
02:45:19,850 --> 02:45:22,329
It's going to break like I was having these panic attacks

3798
02:45:22,329 --> 02:45:23,690
like a week before the stream.

3799
02:45:23,690 --> 02:45:27,799
But then after that first day, it was just like, holy shit,

3800
02:45:27,799 --> 02:45:30,620
this thing like worked pretty much without a hitch at all.

3801
02:45:30,899 --> 02:45:34,620
There was like a minor like that small problem with like the sorting thing.

3802
02:45:34,620 --> 02:45:39,340
But how in the name of God, you guys were able to handle

3803
02:45:39,340 --> 02:45:42,579
30,000, 40,000 inputs like a second.

3804
02:45:44,170 --> 02:45:46,049
I can't believe it. I can't.

3805
02:45:46,049 --> 02:45:47,770
I actually showed some.

3806
02:45:47,770 --> 02:45:50,569
I don't I'm actually traveling right now, so I don't have the pictures on me.

3807
02:45:50,569 --> 02:45:53,690
But I showed some of the heat maps of the placements

3808
02:45:53,690 --> 02:45:55,569
because people thought the placements might have been rigged

3809
02:45:55,889 --> 02:45:57,930
because we didn't show exactly where they placed it.

3810
02:45:58,250 --> 02:46:02,729
But that's because we had 30,000 inputs to sort and visualize.

3811
02:46:02,729 --> 02:46:05,329
And so what we got was this like disgusting

3812
02:46:05,329 --> 02:46:09,569
like rash of like different clips on screen.

3813
02:46:09,569 --> 02:46:13,329
And we had to like interpret that as, oh, they want to block the door. Right.

3814
02:46:13,530 --> 02:46:15,090
And then we would like try to position.

3815
02:46:15,090 --> 02:46:19,409
We tell the production team to put the spotlight at the door to put the item there.

3816
02:46:20,209 --> 02:46:21,649
But yeah, it was insane.

3817
02:46:21,649 --> 02:46:24,930
And we have I can share those pictures with you later, Jake, if you want it.

3818
02:46:24,930 --> 02:46:26,450
But yeah, that'd be great.

3819
02:46:26,450 --> 02:46:30,049
We're going to do we're doing we're doing a BTS

3820
02:46:30,569 --> 02:46:32,129
reel for YouTube.

3821
02:46:32,129 --> 02:46:34,409
And so I'd love to get some of that stuff in there, too.

3822
02:46:34,409 --> 02:46:37,250
Sure thing. Thanks.

3823
02:46:37,250 --> 02:46:38,329
I was asking about the stairs.

3824
02:46:38,329 --> 02:46:40,489
If you wanted to show that real quick, too. Oh, sure. Yeah.

3825
02:46:40,649 --> 02:46:43,850
So yeah, I was asking about the access, the access in the back

3826
02:46:43,850 --> 02:46:45,969
because you can't see that from the camera side.

3827
02:46:45,969 --> 02:46:49,489
The original plan was actually to put these stairs in that space

3828
02:46:49,489 --> 02:46:53,809
between the bathroom and the bedroom between the pink and the blue room there.

3829
02:46:54,930 --> 02:46:59,129
But we realized if you put stairs or you couldn't get furniture up the stairs.

3830
02:46:59,329 --> 02:47:02,889
So we had to put the stairs in the back here to have access for the furniture up.

3831
02:47:02,889 --> 02:47:05,010
But this is what it looks like without the drain.

3832
02:47:06,360 --> 02:47:08,520
It's the kind of thing, too, where the stairs had to be built

3833
02:47:08,520 --> 02:47:11,239
oversized in order to accommodate wide furniture is the kind of thing

3834
02:47:11,239 --> 02:47:13,079
you don't think about without having to like build a set.

3835
02:47:13,079 --> 02:47:15,399
So they had to be built oversized staircase.

3836
02:47:15,399 --> 02:47:17,799
So with extra wide, they could get a couch up if that was picked.

3837
02:47:17,799 --> 02:47:21,440
And then every stair also gets marked with a tape that glows in the dark.

3838
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:23,399
Interacting in the dark back there.

3839
02:47:23,399 --> 02:47:26,040
So everything would get marked with stuff to help me.

3840
02:47:27,639 --> 02:47:31,319
It's actually pretty funny because this this up the stairs, Jake,

3841
02:47:31,319 --> 02:47:34,399
I don't remember like two or three years ago when we first even floated the idea.

3842
02:47:34,840 --> 02:47:37,920
I was like the only reason why I the only reason why I want to start

3843
02:47:37,920 --> 02:47:42,000
process on the stream is because I just I keep seeing this image in my head

3844
02:47:42,399 --> 02:47:46,920
of two or three people in spandex suits just trying to carry a couch upstairs,

3845
02:47:46,920 --> 02:47:49,200
like into a bedroom, like being controlled by chat.

3846
02:47:49,600 --> 02:47:51,239
And I was like, that's that was the reason to do it.

3847
02:47:51,239 --> 02:47:53,200
That was the only reason why I wanted to do it.

3848
02:47:53,200 --> 02:47:55,600
And you guys know we made it happen.

3849
02:47:56,840 --> 02:47:59,059
There's this and there they are.

3850
02:47:59,059 --> 02:48:01,899
This is going up the stairs, like watching guys with like, yeah.

3851
02:48:02,340 --> 02:48:05,979
And you saw earlier the stream that Nick right there, he was here earlier.

3852
02:48:07,930 --> 02:48:08,930
They were unbelievable.

3853
02:48:08,930 --> 02:48:10,489
They were so these guys are so funny.

3854
02:48:10,489 --> 02:48:11,930
They're so talented.

3855
02:48:11,930 --> 02:48:13,569
They're like seven hundred

3856
02:48:13,569 --> 02:48:16,850
IQ engineer brains and they're funny and they're talented.

3857
02:48:16,850 --> 02:48:20,600
It's like they're like perfectly rounded humans.

3858
02:48:20,639 --> 02:48:23,219
It's why we keep working with them.

3859
02:48:23,219 --> 02:48:27,420
They're unbelievable.

3860
02:48:27,420 --> 02:48:33,579
Well, I think this is probably a good point for us to wrap our show.

3861
02:48:34,540 --> 02:48:37,260
A huge big thank you to.

3862
02:48:37,379 --> 02:48:39,620
Oh, yeah. Kit, what's up?

3863
02:48:39,620 --> 02:48:43,049
I don't want to totally interrupt, but do you happen to have a shot of

3864
02:48:43,209 --> 02:48:46,530
at the very end after we ended stream?

3865
02:48:46,530 --> 02:48:50,450
And for like 15 minutes, everyone just stood there and chat was saying

3866
02:48:50,729 --> 02:48:54,750
thanks and clapping for like, yes, forever.

3867
02:48:55,629 --> 02:48:57,229
That shot does exist.

3868
02:48:57,229 --> 02:49:00,069
That was a very surreal moment for me.

3869
02:49:02,110 --> 02:49:05,430
We just all like the whole crew is just sitting there.

3870
02:49:05,670 --> 02:49:08,110
And that was going crazy.

3871
02:49:08,110 --> 02:49:12,030
Yeah, I think he told us that there was something like,

3872
02:49:12,760 --> 02:49:18,000
I don't know how many tens of thousands of people there after it was over to.

3873
02:49:18,399 --> 02:49:22,079
I got a text from from someone at Twitch that was like,

3874
02:49:22,319 --> 02:49:25,639
you know, you've had a good show when you're you've you finished

3875
02:49:25,639 --> 02:49:29,360
and you're on your your end credits and you still have 90,000 people in chat.

3876
02:49:29,760 --> 02:49:33,559
Like it's just it's it was such a cool feeling to be

3877
02:49:33,559 --> 02:49:36,479
have been off screen for 10 minutes and still have 90,000 people there.

3878
02:49:36,479 --> 02:49:39,840
That was that was just going back and looking at the screen

3879
02:49:39,840 --> 02:49:42,840
and chat was still like, thanks, Clem. It was nuts.

3880
02:49:43,120 --> 02:49:47,840
Yeah. A lot of the production team like ran for the on stage

3881
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:51,680
fridge and just grabbed beers out of there like we did it.

3882
02:49:51,680 --> 02:49:54,360
And then we just look and it's time that's all clapping.

3883
02:49:54,360 --> 02:49:58,079
Yeah, it was it was very surreal and euphoric kind of experience.

3884
02:49:58,319 --> 02:50:00,719
I think there's a clip of that in the outro that we had this idea.

3885
02:50:02,020 --> 02:50:05,159
We had this original idea where it was like, you

3886
02:50:05,879 --> 02:50:10,280
how like, oh, yeah, how many people do we get on the on the archaeology stream?

3887
02:50:10,600 --> 02:50:13,239
Oh, that was like forty seven thousand people, fifty thousand people.

3888
02:50:13,239 --> 02:50:15,920
Holy shit. Imagine if we got like forty thousand people again.

3889
02:50:15,959 --> 02:50:18,559
And then we looked over at some point

3890
02:50:18,559 --> 02:50:21,680
at the last moment of the last 45 minutes of the stream.

3891
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:23,879
It was over 100,000 people there.

3892
02:50:23,879 --> 02:50:26,760
And I remember I think that look, I think you were backstage at one point.

3893
02:50:26,760 --> 02:50:28,639
You were like, yeah, just broke 100k.

3894
02:50:28,639 --> 02:50:29,879
And I was like, wait, what happened?

3895
02:50:29,879 --> 02:50:32,770
And I looked over and I'm like, holy shit.

3896
02:50:32,770 --> 02:50:35,010
So, yeah, that was that was more than we ever thought.

3897
02:50:35,010 --> 02:50:37,299
We're ever going to get on the stream.

3898
02:50:37,299 --> 02:50:39,819
I remember keeping an eye on it because everybody was really excited

3899
02:50:39,819 --> 02:50:43,020
about hitting that number, you know, and I was like, yeah, that'd be dope.

3900
02:50:44,309 --> 02:50:46,309
And so I did it. It was.

3901
02:50:47,180 --> 02:50:48,899
It was dope. It was a cool number.

3902
02:50:48,899 --> 02:50:50,649
That's what the kids say.

3903
02:50:50,649 --> 02:50:53,409
Dope. That is busting.

3904
02:50:53,610 --> 02:50:57,610
If you want to use that one, too. OK.

3905
02:50:57,610 --> 02:50:59,010
I'm going to pull next all house.

3906
02:50:59,010 --> 02:51:00,840
Oh, yeah. The next.

3907
02:51:00,840 --> 02:51:03,920
Yeah. The dollhouse stream, too, when we have like eight bedrooms.

3908
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:05,479
Don't say that. Stop.

3909
02:51:05,479 --> 02:51:07,799
I'm going to give you a heart attack.

3910
02:51:07,799 --> 02:51:11,000
It's a month long stream. It doesn't end.

3911
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:13,040
And there's a roof pool.

3912
02:51:13,040 --> 02:51:14,600
Oh, my God. Roof pool.

3913
02:51:14,600 --> 02:51:16,920
And now we're talking with water in it.

3914
02:51:16,920 --> 02:51:19,559
Yeah. Did you talk about the almost water pool that happened?

3915
02:51:20,040 --> 02:51:21,159
No, we didn't.

3916
02:51:21,159 --> 02:51:24,120
So, yeah, that that pool was going to be full with water

3917
02:51:24,780 --> 02:51:27,500
until the day before, like until I think you talked about it

3918
02:51:27,500 --> 02:51:30,739
while the stream was happening, right? Yeah. Yeah.

3919
02:51:30,739 --> 02:51:33,180
Live, I remember you talking about like, hey, this was have water in it.

3920
02:51:33,180 --> 02:51:36,579
But we thought that against that.

3921
02:51:36,579 --> 02:51:40,090
Yeah, it was all going to happen.

3922
02:51:40,090 --> 02:51:41,489
I remember. Yeah.

3923
02:51:41,489 --> 02:51:44,530
Jeremy, you were like, yeah, it's going to be like 100 pounds of water, right?

3924
02:51:44,530 --> 02:51:48,170
And Jacob, you're like, no, that's thousands of pounds of water.

3925
02:51:48,409 --> 02:51:50,209
Yeah, it's nine thousand pounds of water.

3926
02:51:50,209 --> 02:51:52,610
It's a 1200 gallon pool and a gallon of water.

3927
02:51:52,610 --> 02:51:57,250
I'm just like, do we like we don't really need it to be full of water.

3928
02:51:57,290 --> 02:52:00,049
I mean, we're using it for like it's one day.

3929
02:52:00,049 --> 02:52:01,729
Do we really? We don't need that much.

3930
02:52:01,729 --> 02:52:03,889
We don't need a pool in here because that was like logistically

3931
02:52:04,250 --> 02:52:07,340
when the stream was done, somebody has to get rid of that.

3932
02:52:07,340 --> 02:52:08,899
Like somebody has to take that somewhere.

3933
02:52:08,899 --> 02:52:10,020
What do you do? What do you do with it?

3934
02:52:10,020 --> 02:52:11,459
So I was like, just don't even put water in it.

3935
02:52:11,459 --> 02:52:14,340
There's no reason to.

3936
02:52:14,340 --> 02:52:15,840
Oh, no, my cam froze.

3937
02:52:15,840 --> 02:52:17,879
This is oh, boy. Oh, you're still here.

3938
02:52:18,559 --> 02:52:21,309
We can hear you. Yeah.

3939
02:52:21,309 --> 02:52:22,579
You look good.

3940
02:52:22,579 --> 02:52:25,540
I want to take a I want to take a moment to plug

3941
02:52:26,500 --> 02:52:31,020
our merch site, a little bit of backstory on the merch because

3942
02:52:32,700 --> 02:52:34,299
we've we've seen it on Reddit and stuff.

3943
02:52:34,299 --> 02:52:38,819
So the the plan for the merch came together before

3944
02:52:39,700 --> 02:52:43,780
Ludwig's involvement and Coinbase's involvement because we were flat broke.

3945
02:52:43,860 --> 02:52:46,540
I mean, we were in the hole a lot of money

3946
02:52:47,260 --> 02:52:49,340
and we were like, oh, my God, how are we going to

3947
02:52:49,379 --> 02:52:50,459
how are we going to pay for this?

3948
02:52:50,459 --> 02:52:52,739
Like, we're going to have bills due and we're not going to be able to pay them.

3949
02:52:53,200 --> 02:52:56,399
And so we decided to launch a merch line.

3950
02:52:56,520 --> 02:52:59,600
And that's what we did.

3951
02:52:59,600 --> 02:53:03,360
And so we did some kind of generic merch, the t-shirts and the

3952
02:53:03,360 --> 02:53:04,600
and the sweatshirts, which are pretty cool.

3953
02:53:04,600 --> 02:53:07,879
We did the special edition, the green one and commissioned that poster.

3954
02:53:07,879 --> 02:53:10,120
But obviously, we didn't have any content yet from the show.

3955
02:53:10,760 --> 02:53:12,879
But we were like, we just have to we have to put something out there.

3956
02:53:12,879 --> 02:53:16,920
And then we kind of came up with this idea of, OK, after the show airs,

3957
02:53:17,200 --> 02:53:20,440
we can sell a bunch of the stuff that was that were props on the show.

3958
02:53:20,440 --> 02:53:22,639
So if you go over to the site, German 95 dot com,

3959
02:53:23,120 --> 02:53:25,920
there's a link out to our eBay store where we have a whole bunch of props

3960
02:53:25,920 --> 02:53:27,760
for sale that were that were used on the show.

3961
02:53:28,440 --> 02:53:32,680
And we also have worked with some community artists.

3962
02:53:32,680 --> 02:53:36,319
And we are now selling some fan art posters and stickers.

3963
02:53:37,120 --> 02:53:40,200
So you can go and check those out and order those,

3964
02:53:40,639 --> 02:53:42,840
support the community, support the artists in the community

3965
02:53:43,719 --> 02:53:45,840
and help support the show.

3966
02:53:45,879 --> 02:53:47,600
So that's my plug.

3967
02:53:47,600 --> 02:53:49,600
I'm sorry I had to do it, but it's part of my job.

3968
02:53:49,600 --> 02:53:52,200
So German 95 dot com, go check it out.

3969
02:53:55,700 --> 02:53:58,610
Do it only if you want to do it now.

3970
02:53:58,610 --> 02:54:01,899
But you could. And the auctions, when do the auctions end?

3971
02:54:02,520 --> 02:54:06,399
The auctions end tomorrow night, basically.

3972
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:08,639
Tomorrow night, like Pacific time.

3973
02:54:08,639 --> 02:54:10,040
Like, is there a certain time?

3974
02:54:10,040 --> 02:54:13,120
Yeah, Alex, what's the I think they end at one a.m.

3975
02:54:13,120 --> 02:54:15,000
Eastern on the second.

3976
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:17,719
So I would say by yeah, that's 10 p.m. Pacific.

3977
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:21,139
They say, oh, they say out of stock,

3978
02:54:21,139 --> 02:54:23,540
but they're not actually out of the click through.

3979
02:54:23,579 --> 02:54:25,180
You got to go to the eBay click.

3980
02:54:25,180 --> 02:54:26,979
Yeah, it is.

3981
02:54:26,979 --> 02:54:27,940
It is anyway.

3982
02:54:27,940 --> 02:54:30,059
There's too many layers of friction, I will tell you.

3983
02:54:30,059 --> 02:54:33,489
I think the eBay should just bring you to the the seller.

3984
02:54:33,489 --> 02:54:34,809
If you link it directly to the cell.

3985
02:54:34,809 --> 02:54:37,049
Well, we when we built the store, we had a problem

3986
02:54:37,049 --> 02:54:38,409
because it was a new eBay account.

3987
02:54:38,409 --> 02:54:41,170
And when you list things on a new eBay account, the seller page

3988
02:54:41,170 --> 02:54:43,729
won't display the eBay auction items.

3989
02:54:44,389 --> 02:54:46,590
Now that we have hundreds of bids, that does work.

3990
02:54:46,909 --> 02:54:50,989
But we would have to go back and change the infrastructure on.

3991
02:54:51,549 --> 02:54:54,590
Day battleships going for a penny, bro.

3992
02:54:55,870 --> 02:55:00,909
I was just going for it's at four twenty six or four twenty five sixty nine.

3993
02:55:01,819 --> 02:55:04,540
Why are you so why are you currently bidding on it right now?

3994
02:55:06,540 --> 02:55:07,979
Why is this on screen?

3995
02:55:07,979 --> 02:55:09,940
These were the options for your bed.

3996
02:55:09,940 --> 02:55:12,059
Remember, I I sent you a text.

3997
02:55:12,620 --> 02:55:13,459
I sent you a text.

3998
02:55:13,459 --> 02:55:14,620
Which sheet set do you want?

3999
02:55:14,620 --> 02:55:18,889
And you picked the gamer ones.

4000
02:55:18,889 --> 02:55:22,930
I like that there's the glass on sale because that is going to be

4001
02:55:22,930 --> 02:55:26,510
the most fun thing to ship is.

4002
02:55:26,790 --> 02:55:29,979
Well, it's Hollywood glass.

4003
02:55:29,979 --> 02:55:33,100
It just shows up as like a bunch of pieces.

4004
02:55:33,100 --> 02:55:34,420
I think we have a disclaimer.

4005
02:55:34,420 --> 02:55:37,500
We don't we don't insure it.

4006
02:55:37,500 --> 02:55:41,059
Oh, man. That's a sick item.

4007
02:55:41,059 --> 02:55:42,219
Site is dead.

4008
02:55:42,219 --> 02:55:44,979
Well, it's probably 20,000 people clicking on it at the same time.

4009
02:55:44,979 --> 02:55:49,680
Yeah, it's been serviced, whatever it is.

4010
02:55:51,340 --> 02:55:53,299
The eBay seller name eBay seller.

4011
02:55:53,299 --> 02:55:57,739
Yeah, the eBay seller is Elberton and Sons.

4012
02:55:57,780 --> 02:56:02,780
And we get the highest priced item is the signed costume package,

4013
02:56:03,799 --> 02:56:08,719
which includes the taped watch and the drinking hat.

4014
02:56:08,719 --> 02:56:11,000
And your signature looks great on that one.

4015
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:14,239
I think I have a clip of him signing that maybe I'll add some value if I play that.

4016
02:56:19,139 --> 02:56:21,620
Just so you know, we didn't like it once and we just printed it.

4017
02:56:23,979 --> 02:56:27,059
How the fuck you how are you going to OK, whoever gets the mailbox?

4018
02:56:28,440 --> 02:56:29,959
It's a real huge mailbox.

4019
02:56:29,959 --> 02:56:31,639
You put it in front of your house.

4020
02:56:31,639 --> 02:56:35,219
That's definitely an interesting item.

4021
02:56:36,479 --> 02:56:37,440
This is real.

4022
02:56:37,440 --> 02:56:40,780
I mean, I would just like all the posters.

4023
02:56:40,780 --> 02:56:41,700
It's kind of fun.

4024
02:56:41,700 --> 02:56:45,940
Work your way through.

4025
02:56:45,940 --> 02:56:48,440
Yeah, I know I have a clip of him.

4026
02:56:48,440 --> 02:56:53,280
If you win, if you win the helmet, message me and I'll get you the clip of him

4027
02:56:53,280 --> 02:56:56,420
signing the helmet, because I know I have that one somewhere.

4028
02:56:56,420 --> 02:56:59,059
Oh, that's cool. Not fake. Not fake.

4029
02:57:00,040 --> 02:57:01,479
Yeah, but where do you put the mailbox?

4030
02:57:01,479 --> 02:57:04,719
You can put that in front of your house or like where do you do it?

4031
02:57:04,719 --> 02:57:05,879
It's a real mailbox.

4032
02:57:06,440 --> 02:57:09,680
You like petition the town to change your house number to 985

4033
02:57:09,680 --> 02:57:11,760
so that you can use the mailbox.

4034
02:57:11,760 --> 02:57:14,200
One, two, three, nine, eight, five, the plaque.

4035
02:57:16,700 --> 02:57:19,479
One, two, three. Yeah, just put it right here.

4036
02:57:19,479 --> 02:57:23,479
Didn't someone find like a dollhouse lane in like one of the videos?

4037
02:57:24,040 --> 02:57:26,780
Wait, is there actually a dollhouse lane?

4038
02:57:26,780 --> 02:57:29,899
Is there really? I think so.

4039
02:57:29,899 --> 02:57:31,500
I didn't want to say like a real place.

4040
02:57:31,500 --> 02:57:33,860
I'm like, nine, eight, five, nine, eight, five dollhouse way.

4041
02:57:33,860 --> 02:57:36,500
And I'm just like, that can't be a real fucking place.

4042
02:57:36,500 --> 02:57:38,940
I don't know if people saw to on Jeremy on your plaque.

4043
02:57:39,059 --> 02:57:42,299
I don't know if people saw the there's a little detail kind of hidden on that plaque.

4044
02:57:42,700 --> 02:57:44,059
Oh, there is. There is.

4045
02:57:44,059 --> 02:57:47,100
Yeah, my look, I was doing waist up today.

4046
02:57:47,100 --> 02:57:48,420
So like I didn't think I was going to have to.

4047
02:57:48,420 --> 02:57:51,739
I was like, look, I look I look like like I have a good shirt on.

4048
02:57:51,739 --> 02:57:53,379
I have like a nice like V neck on.

4049
02:57:53,379 --> 02:57:59,489
Just stay low. I don't care. I'm weird.

4050
02:57:59,489 --> 02:58:00,370
I'm not looking.

4051
02:58:00,370 --> 02:58:02,450
And I think you can see me from the from the waist down.

4052
02:58:02,770 --> 02:58:04,770
I was staring. I couldn't see it.

4053
02:58:04,770 --> 02:58:07,569
The folks at Andy Mark built a little piece into that for you.

4054
02:58:08,139 --> 02:58:10,340
I see it on the top there.

4055
02:58:10,340 --> 02:58:11,899
Yeah, that's cool.

4056
02:58:11,899 --> 02:58:14,540
That's a little hard to see, but the logo is engraved on the top.

4057
02:58:14,540 --> 02:58:16,059
So the logo is engraved.

4058
02:58:16,059 --> 02:58:18,340
You can see it when it shines.

4059
02:58:18,340 --> 02:58:19,459
Now I try to.

4060
02:58:19,459 --> 02:58:20,659
Oh, here, wait, I'll bring it back.

4061
02:58:20,659 --> 02:58:25,420
I'll bring it back.

4062
02:58:25,420 --> 02:58:30,860
It's weird because my camera's delayed.

4063
02:58:30,860 --> 02:58:32,299
Yeah, you can see it. There it goes.

4064
02:58:32,299 --> 02:58:33,379
Yeah. Yeah, you got it.

4065
02:58:33,379 --> 02:58:35,100
That's it right there. Yeah.

4066
02:58:35,100 --> 02:58:38,139
Yeah, it's awesome.

4067
02:58:38,139 --> 02:58:39,299
Very, very lovely stuff.

4068
02:58:39,299 --> 02:58:41,340
It was a nice touch.

4069
02:58:41,340 --> 02:58:44,340
I remember I felt like Nick, like, showed me this and like handed it.

4070
02:58:44,340 --> 02:58:45,940
It was like, yeah, we look at that.

4071
02:58:45,940 --> 02:58:51,340
And I was like, I was so touched.

4072
02:58:51,340 --> 02:58:53,659
I was just like, hold it together.

4073
02:58:53,659 --> 02:58:54,940
Hold it together. Hold it together.

4074
02:58:54,940 --> 02:58:59,639
I can't like, you know, at times I like tried to not like cry.

4075
02:58:59,639 --> 02:59:05,840
Like, it's like the last day, especially, I was like, thanks for coming.

4076
02:59:05,840 --> 02:59:08,840
It was like so difficult to like, just tear the water.

4077
02:59:08,840 --> 02:59:11,840
And then the day after when we were tearing down and you came by the set,

4078
02:59:11,840 --> 02:59:13,799
you like came by the set for like a minute.

4079
02:59:13,799 --> 02:59:15,280
And then you just like went to the office

4080
02:59:15,280 --> 02:59:18,559
because I think you were just so upset about the whole thing coming down.

4081
02:59:18,559 --> 02:59:19,840
It was just it was it was sad.

4082
02:59:19,840 --> 02:59:23,440
Yeah, I just think everybody was taking cords down, was dropping stuff.

4083
02:59:23,440 --> 02:59:26,139
And I was just like, oh, it's sad.

4084
02:59:26,180 --> 02:59:28,739
But it was fun. Now on to the next one, right?

4085
02:59:29,059 --> 02:59:32,989
Absolutely.

4086
02:59:36,200 --> 02:59:39,719
I think if we're cool, we'll leave it here.

4087
02:59:41,260 --> 02:59:43,819
This has been it for the Dollhouse and the Dollhouse crew.

4088
02:59:44,579 --> 02:59:48,260
Thank you so much to our wonderful talent that's here with us, our fantastic crew.

4089
02:59:52,139 --> 02:59:53,659
At least he's smiling.

4090
02:59:53,659 --> 02:59:54,459
I'm doing what I can.

4091
02:59:54,459 --> 02:59:57,420
For a second, I thought, whoa, it just moved.

4092
02:59:57,659 --> 02:59:59,340
He's shaking it when he talks.

4093
02:59:59,340 --> 03:00:00,340
I'm moving it when I talk.

4094
03:00:00,340 --> 03:00:03,500
What? Oh, I thought like, OK, that was freaking me out.

4095
03:00:03,500 --> 03:00:06,219
I was like, why isn't it moving?

4096
03:00:06,219 --> 03:00:07,920
Everybody's talking about it.

4097
03:00:07,920 --> 03:00:10,340
I appreciate you a little bit.

4098
03:00:10,340 --> 03:00:12,659
I got you. Hold on.

4099
03:00:12,659 --> 03:00:14,219
Although I'm out of focus.

4100
03:00:14,219 --> 03:00:15,739
There we go. There we go.

4101
03:00:15,739 --> 03:00:17,219
Yeah. Yeah.

4102
03:00:19,909 --> 03:00:22,110
We're going to go to that corner.

4103
03:00:22,110 --> 03:00:24,629
Yeah, can we? Is there a way we can do that?

4104
03:00:24,629 --> 03:00:29,930
I think we can do that.

4105
03:00:29,930 --> 03:00:32,649
Sure. He's going to get on his knees.

4106
03:00:32,649 --> 03:00:37,770
I can't. I have to shake my camera by actually shaking my desk.

4107
03:00:40,100 --> 03:00:42,899
Oh, no, the immersion.

4108
03:00:42,899 --> 03:00:45,180
We're in these squares. Well.

4109
03:00:46,260 --> 03:00:48,139
This is adorable. Thank you.

4110
03:00:48,139 --> 03:00:49,979
I can't move this.

4111
03:00:49,979 --> 03:00:52,420
We're stuck in the chairs.

4112
03:00:53,360 --> 03:00:55,799
All right, Chad, vote and BTS stream.

4113
03:00:56,000 --> 03:00:58,600
Vote BTS, please, we need to go home.

4114
03:00:59,520 --> 03:01:01,280
Well, I have to wait before we end the stream.

4115
03:01:01,280 --> 03:01:02,239
I got to say this, too.

4116
03:01:02,239 --> 03:01:04,680
Yeah, I I'm going to be live tomorrow.

4117
03:01:04,840 --> 03:01:06,579
Like, we're going back to kind of normal.

4118
03:01:06,579 --> 03:01:08,100
So I'll be live tomorrow.

4119
03:01:08,100 --> 03:01:12,940
I'm going to play Hard Time, that like prison game where you're like in prison.

4120
03:01:12,940 --> 03:01:13,219
It's M.

4121
03:01:13,219 --> 03:01:16,139
Dickie, the wrestling wrestling game guy.

4122
03:01:16,139 --> 03:01:17,659
I know that game. Yeah.

4123
03:01:17,659 --> 03:01:21,139
Yeah, it looks like fucking it looks insane.

4124
03:01:21,139 --> 03:01:22,500
So I'll be back tomorrow.

4125
03:01:22,500 --> 03:01:23,739
Well, I'll just check the sauce.

4126
03:01:23,739 --> 03:01:26,579
I want to make sure I got that out so people knew that I was coming back tomorrow.

4127
03:01:26,579 --> 03:01:31,930
And we're back this weekend on probably Friday or Saturday.

4128
03:01:31,930 --> 03:01:34,959
Probably starting No More Heroes 3.

4129
03:01:34,959 --> 03:01:38,459
Going to be a fun one. Been waiting for that one.

4130
03:01:38,459 --> 03:01:39,500
Can we plug everybody?

4131
03:01:39,500 --> 03:01:40,700
I mean, everybody knows who these guys are.

4132
03:01:40,700 --> 03:01:46,190
They're fucking they're absolute lads.

4133
03:01:46,190 --> 03:01:46,870
I'm going to do some plug.

4134
03:01:46,870 --> 03:01:49,030
Hey, you know, we can't be doing our thing going on.

4135
03:01:49,030 --> 03:01:50,069
We can't be doing our thing.

4136
03:01:50,069 --> 03:01:51,430
Twitch.TV4 slash get buggy.

4137
03:01:51,430 --> 03:01:54,579
You know, you know where to find us at.

4138
03:01:54,579 --> 03:01:57,500
Oh, thanks for involving us.

4139
03:01:57,500 --> 03:01:58,819
Thanks for inviting me.

4140
03:01:58,819 --> 03:02:00,399
It was a blast.

4141
03:02:00,399 --> 03:02:02,159
It was great working with all you guys.

4142
03:02:02,159 --> 03:02:03,200
You, too, Ludwig.

4143
03:02:03,200 --> 03:02:06,000
Hey, and when you invited me to that sleepover the first night

4144
03:02:06,000 --> 03:02:12,819
and you had that like that little milk carton, the warm milk for me.

4145
03:02:12,819 --> 03:02:15,100
Yeah, you know, I do what I can, man.

4146
03:02:15,100 --> 03:02:16,139
I do what I can.

4147
03:02:16,139 --> 03:02:18,020
I was a little hurt when you said you wouldn't stay the night,

4148
03:02:18,020 --> 03:02:20,059
but it is what it is.

4149
03:02:22,180 --> 03:02:24,319
Lost on that one.

4150
03:02:24,319 --> 03:02:25,280
I'm joking.

4151
03:02:25,280 --> 03:02:27,559
I do have to say thank you

4152
03:02:29,000 --> 03:02:32,440
for getting me a way nicer room than Jerma for no reason.

4153
03:02:35,139 --> 03:02:37,739
People don't know about that, but they hooked me up.

4154
03:02:38,059 --> 03:02:41,819
They hooked me up with the room, the ride and the flight.

4155
03:02:42,729 --> 03:02:44,649
I was making a joke the whole time.

4156
03:02:44,649 --> 03:02:46,850
I was like, oh, hey, by the way, I'm in the presidential suite.

4157
03:02:47,049 --> 03:02:49,209
I've got three bedrooms under the presidential.

4158
03:02:49,209 --> 03:02:51,329
And I wasn't at all. I was just in a regular room.

4159
03:02:51,329 --> 03:02:53,899
And then he was like, wait, that's the room I'm in.

4160
03:02:53,899 --> 03:02:55,500
I'm like, no, what are you talking about?

4161
03:02:55,500 --> 03:02:58,059
He's like, yeah, I'm in like I'm in the fucking suite, dude.

4162
03:02:58,059 --> 03:03:00,510
And I'm like, you got a suite.

4163
03:03:00,510 --> 03:03:03,549
I didn't like I actually thought you're making the joke.

4164
03:03:03,549 --> 03:03:05,069
We made the joke every night.

4165
03:03:05,069 --> 03:03:08,190
I thought you knew because we both that you didn't have a suite at all.

4166
03:03:08,190 --> 03:03:10,229
I went into your room. I was like, I don't think this.

4167
03:03:11,180 --> 03:03:12,819
I didn't think anybody had a suite.

4168
03:03:12,819 --> 03:03:15,459
So I was like making the joke that like, oh, I get the suite. Right.

4169
03:03:15,459 --> 03:03:17,180
But I just didn't. But you did.

4170
03:03:17,180 --> 03:03:18,579
I mean, Jerma called me.

4171
03:03:18,579 --> 03:03:20,979
Jerma called me and said, like, like, it's coming.

4172
03:03:20,979 --> 03:03:21,819
He's good. He's coming.

4173
03:03:21,819 --> 03:03:23,739
Like, like, you know, make arrangements.

4174
03:03:23,739 --> 03:03:25,500
And I'm like, fuck, I don't know what that means.

4175
03:03:25,500 --> 03:03:27,340
Like, what do I have to do?

4176
03:03:27,340 --> 03:03:31,299
And so he's like, yeah, it's the first class limousine.

4177
03:03:31,340 --> 03:03:33,260
We'll get him the presidential suite, like whatever.

4178
03:03:33,260 --> 03:03:35,219
Yeah, I don't live all the way.

4179
03:03:35,219 --> 03:03:38,020
And I'm pretty sure Jerma had to ask, like three wise men,

4180
03:03:38,020 --> 03:03:41,020
which direction the hotel was at.

4181
03:03:41,659 --> 03:03:42,819
It was beautiful.

4182
03:03:42,819 --> 03:03:45,299
I didn't say presidential suite.

4183
03:03:45,500 --> 03:03:47,139
I just said, oh, it's like, take care of him.

4184
03:03:47,139 --> 03:03:49,299
You know, it's like, I don't know.

4185
03:03:49,299 --> 03:03:51,059
It's like he's a fucking big guy.

4186
03:03:51,059 --> 03:03:52,100
He's like an important guy.

4187
03:03:52,100 --> 03:03:56,620
If it's not presidential, I don't show up.

4188
03:03:56,620 --> 03:03:58,829
Make notes.

4189
03:03:58,829 --> 03:04:01,430
Oh, make arrangements for him.

4190
03:04:01,430 --> 03:04:02,829
God. Make arrangements.

4191
03:04:02,829 --> 03:04:06,750
But long story short, yeah, I did not have that suite and he did.

4192
03:04:06,750 --> 03:04:10,309
And I was very surprised to hear about it.

4193
03:04:10,309 --> 03:04:13,149
It was like the last night, too, at the last possible minute.

4194
03:04:14,100 --> 03:04:15,760
Yeah.

4195
03:04:15,760 --> 03:04:18,219
Kraikin, you got a plug?

4196
03:04:18,219 --> 03:04:22,059
Yeah, you can catch me on Twitch at twitch.tv slash Kraikin.

4197
03:04:22,659 --> 03:04:25,340
I'm actually currently on vacation after dollhouse.

4198
03:04:25,340 --> 03:04:26,340
I need a little bit of time off.

4199
03:04:26,340 --> 03:04:28,940
So I'm I'm deserved, I think.

4200
03:04:29,500 --> 03:04:33,139
Yeah, I'm not going to be streaming that frequently for the next two weeks.

4201
03:04:33,139 --> 03:04:36,899
But then when I get back, we're doing more interactive streams like dollhouse.

4202
03:04:36,899 --> 03:04:39,459
If you like stuff like that, we do that all all the time on my show

4203
03:04:40,659 --> 03:04:41,620
as well as some other stuff.

4204
03:04:41,620 --> 03:04:46,870
So, yeah, I'm going to plug Jerma985.com

4205
03:04:46,870 --> 03:04:51,319
go buy some merch so I can pay my mortgage.

4206
03:04:51,319 --> 03:04:54,000
You just tore down a perfectly good house.

4207
03:04:58,219 --> 03:05:00,020
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

4208
03:05:00,020 --> 03:05:01,700
I'll be live tomorrow.

4209
03:05:01,700 --> 03:05:03,340
Thanks, everybody.

4210
03:05:03,340 --> 03:05:04,020
Thank you.

4211
03:05:04,020 --> 03:05:04,940
Thanks, guys. Thanks.

4212
03:05:04,940 --> 03:05:07,139
It was an unbelievable experience.

4213
03:05:07,139 --> 03:05:10,079
Yeah, I'll cherish it forever.

4214
03:05:10,079 --> 03:05:12,170
Thanks for your support, chat.

4215
03:05:12,170 --> 03:05:14,799
It means a lot. Bye.
