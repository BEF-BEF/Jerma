1
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:13,939
Hello. Yes, I'm currently- I'm currently late, but it's okay. It's a very good reason to be late,

2
00:00:13,939 --> 00:00:17,219
and I'll show you the reason. Well, he's running out. He ran out of the room. Never mind.

3
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:28,920
He ran out. He was- he was here. Arto. Hold on. Ready? Arto, look. Arto, come over here.

4
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,060
Go! Go over there. Quick, I need to show you on stream.

5
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:44,619
Arto, what's this? Arto, what's over there? Arto! Hey, Arto! Arto! Arto!

6
00:00:44,619 --> 00:00:51,509
You saw his tail. I- all right, whatever. I was trying to get him to, like, be, like, on camera.

7
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:55,829
And just, like, bed. It don't matter. All right, go back to the intro. You saw his tail.

8
00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:15,019
See? There he is. Maybe he'll show back up. Arto! What's that? A fishkin? A fishkin!

9
00:01:15,019 --> 00:01:18,760
All right, I'll get out of the way. All right. All right, all right, all right.

10
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:31,780
Back to the intro. Is Arto a tortoise? Um, he's kind of as fat as a tortoise.

11
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:43,959
Best in time to see Arto. Yeah, he chased- he chased a little, uh, a little, like, milk boat in here.

12
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:56,250
Arto is a wise beast, yeah. All right, yeah. We're gonna play more Elden Ring. Hello? Let me just

13
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:02,920
tweet this. I just did want to show that because people were asking, where is Arto? There- there's

14
00:02:02,920 --> 00:03:17,219
Arto. Now, let's let the intro play out for a minute. Hold on. Okay, I'm back. Okay, so you're

15
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:24,539
also probably noticing something very important. It's very, very important. Um, there's no drop

16
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:35,050
frames, and there shouldn't be. I have absolutely no idea why that's been happening, but I think

17
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:43,419
I've got- I've fixed it. I did, uh, a bunch of stream tests on a bunch of different servers,

18
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:49,930
and I found a server. I found one of the Twitch servers, a server that is working well.

19
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:58,439
I've streamed to the same server for, like, two years, and I can't stream to it anymore, I guess.

20
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:11,110
I don't know why. I have no idea. Nothing changed on my end. It's just, I don't know if the traffic

21
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:17,110
has started getting routed in a different way, but it gets across your fingers because I think

22
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:25,639
this is gonna be fine. Please stop playing Elden Ring. Is this your retirement special? What,

23
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:33,480
like, I'm just going hard and then never coming back? Okay, okay, listen. Games like these only

24
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:40,420
come around, like, once every half a decade. So, no, look, I'm not gonna go play, like,

25
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:46,420
fucking bathtub simulator right now. Elden Ring comes along once every fucking half decade,

26
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:53,339
right? Maybe once every decade. We'll, I promise, we'll go back to, like,

27
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,899
we'll go back to fucking screwdriver simulator in, like, a week, all right?

28
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,639
Well, you play as a screwdriver and you have to, like, roll around and get to checkpoints

29
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:11,959
only using your body to roll. Like, we'll go back to those. Just give me, just give me some time.

30
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:25,509
Heart simulator. I actually, it's funny because I, we actually might play Mario Golf,

31
00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:30,519
like, in a couple days or something. That's a, that's a pretty good way to break up Elden Ring,

32
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:36,120
right? That one person that said you should play Mario Golf, and I was like, no, that sounds like

33
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:44,490
a dumb idea. Well, I'm just gonna play Mario Golf. So, maybe the next stream after this will

34
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:50,220
be Mario Golf, and then we'll go back to Elden Ring. But currently very into it, at least into

35
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:55,930
it enough to keep streaming it. We'll see. I don't, this game is massive, so I don't know

36
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:00,660
how far I'm gonna get. All I know is right now I'm super interested, so let's go. Guys, ready?

37
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:07,660
Etterby. Make sure I'm in a good spot. Make sure that the camera's in a good spot.

38
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:18,740
And, I mean, are we, are we good? We should be. He's still hanging out. He's still hanging out. I

39
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:23,699
can't promise he'll be here the whole time. He'll probably start running around. He like, he's an

40
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:33,740
explorer. He, Otto does not have one particular place that he likes. I've had to get like three

41
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:39,579
different little dog beds because he, I want to be in this room. No, no, no. I want to be in this

42
00:06:39,579 --> 00:06:45,939
room. He'll go down into, he'll go into another room and lie on a pile of clothes. And it's like,

43
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:53,060
what are you doing in here? I, I could get you a bed. And then a bed, I'll get a little bed in

44
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:57,660
that same spot where the clothes were. And he sits in that bed all the time. It's like, it's one of

45
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:08,019
his like bonfires. Otto has literally bonfires all around every place they've ever been in.

46
00:07:08,019 --> 00:07:18,379
And some of them, I got him a really expensive bed and he doesn't like it. I wasn't calling Otto

47
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:25,560
fat. Is it, no, well you can call Otto fat because he is a little fat. All right. You guys ready?

48
00:07:27,579 --> 00:07:32,389
I'm very happy that the internet seems to be good. I seem to have found the server that works.

49
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:39,290
So let's hope that continues. You're probably wondering why I have 20,000 souls when I'd had

50
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:46,060
like two last stream. That's very important. It's because I was testing the internet. So I was just

51
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:52,569
running around doing like a stream test and just trying to replicate the problem. And the problem

52
00:07:52,569 --> 00:08:00,500
has not been replicated. So yeah, whatever. And I may, I may have like, I may have like fucking,

53
00:08:02,329 --> 00:08:10,550
I may have read a few things. I may have like read a lot. What level am I right now? I am level 73.

54
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:24,759
Let's take a look. Let's do, let's, you know, let's do this first because we do this every stream.

55
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:29,980
Let's take a look at what we can, what we can do here. Some of the stuff needs to be updated.

56
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:35,779
For instance, light fires and knock around that we already did that.

57
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:42,980
Renes is closed for now. It is no longer closed. We've, we got to it. This is still accurate. This

58
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:52,549
is still accurate. This is still accurate. And can I, can I get rid of this? Door next to spawn

59
00:08:52,549 --> 00:09:02,620
is blocked shut. Should I just remove that? I feel like that's completely irrelevant. All right,

60
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:08,940
whatever. So the last thing that I did, I was about to go down here. We're currently doing

61
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:17,720
Renes quest, which is going to lead us apparently down here. No audio. Let me fix that immediately.

62
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:28,950
Let's go. Oh, well I already see a huge problem. Face cam is not even in the right spot. It's

63
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:45,210
already a big problem. That's better. Is it better? It is. Kind of. All right, let's go.

64
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:50,889
You're wondering the kind of character I'm playing. I'm playing a little bit of intelligence,

65
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:56,629
a little bit of dexterity, a little bit of int. I think I'm probably about to run into something

66
00:09:56,629 --> 00:10:01,830
that I'm not prepared for right now, but whatever. It's elven ring, baby. You just fucking got to go.

67
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:17,029
Are you doing a bimbo build? Um, I don't, I don't know. I actually was laughing my ass off.

68
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:24,250
I was, I was, okay. So before I fell asleep last night, I was laughing. I couldn't stop laughing

69
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:32,539
because I was thinking about the me strong. Like, no, you have to do one stream as me strong,

70
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:38,789
but you have to be high on THC. And I just, I don't know. I started laughing so hard about it

71
00:10:38,789 --> 00:10:45,909
because like, imagine this, this fucking, this guy, this caveman, like a loincloth and a big

72
00:10:45,909 --> 00:10:51,960
turkey leg club, just like ate a bunch of berries he found and he's just like fucking fucked up and

73
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:58,460
high. And he's the guy that can like, he can like kill Margaret. No, they would, that guy would die

74
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:04,169
instantly. That guy would die without even anyone attacking him. I'm just imagining this like, just

75
00:11:04,169 --> 00:11:09,850
completely hallucinogenic high caveman, just walking around and killing stuff. And it's just

76
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:17,220
like, why are you in this universe? You should not be in this universe. And like, that's what

77
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:24,340
would be happening. It would just be, I would be inebriated, I guess in quotes, and I would be

78
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:30,059
just role playing as this weird caveman. That's how the ancestors did it. Yeah. That's like kind

79
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:36,379
of fucking weird that that's exactly what happened. If you're this Bush, colorful Bush,

80
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:47,080
oh, you, I kill you. Like, no, no, no, don't kill me. What are you talking about? Don't hurt me.

81
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:59,860
I, it was fucking nonsense back then. That's what got me on that is you want to talk about

82
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:06,299
bimbo gameplay? That's not how weed works. I'm not saying weed, I'm saying like back in like the

83
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:11,659
fucking, before the prehistoric medieval times, where like cavemen were eating like random

84
00:12:11,659 --> 00:12:15,580
hallucinogenic berries and fucking killing each other. What, of course, that's not what happens

85
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:23,860
when you, if you have like, what are you talking about? All right, I actually think I can level up.

86
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:45,320
Let's go. Ooh, that's, that's a clean 10k. That's a clean 10k. 31. Okay. Why is that a clip on

87
00:12:45,320 --> 00:13:00,919
command? I didn't see it. What was it? All right. I, I, I, I think I, I, I, I can't see. I can't see.

88
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:05,000
He can't see. I can't see. Why am I doing so many mad, mad, mad, mad world references? Maybe it's

89
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,909
because I like watched it recently. All right. I'm going to say, do we just dump intelligence and

90
00:13:11,909 --> 00:13:19,269
try to get it to 50 or do I need to seriously put more points in endurance? I don't, endurance is

91
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:26,779
not an issue in this game. It really isn't something that's changed in this game. I don't

92
00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:30,539
know what they did or what kind of math or calculations they've been making and Elden ring.

93
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:36,820
I don't even feel like endurance is the bar. It feels like it's very, very forgiving to a

94
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:44,120
point where like, you don't even need to put points into it unless you're doing like a heavy

95
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:49,399
character. Yeah. But it used to be, you would need to put endurance points in because the stamina

96
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:58,889
bar was hard to manage. All right. How do I get down here? Is it, can I jump from here?

97
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:15,879
I have to jump. Are you kidding me? I'm going to die if I fall down here. No, I can't do that.

98
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:34,259
So where do I go? There's a, there's a lip right here. Oh shit. Okay. Old and centipede sick. How

99
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:41,929
do you like your eggs? I want to know. Uh, over medium. I don't think eggs should be eaten over

100
00:14:41,929 --> 00:14:47,690
easy or sunny side up unless the yolk is, uh, is not, I like a jammy yolk. I do not like a runny

101
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:54,940
yolk. I find that to be, it gets everywhere. It gets all over everything. A jammy yolk is able,

102
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:58,700
you get the benefits of having it be a little bit runny, but it doesn't get all over your whole

103
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:04,700
plate. And you don't need like five napkins to go like this and shit. And I sometimes, I don't know

104
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:14,360
where, whenever I have a runny egg, it gets all over me. I don't know why I don't, I, I, I don't,

105
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:19,259
I don't understand how, but it just does like, it'll get like here or something. And then it's

106
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:23,419
like here and then it's like on a napkin and then it like starts solidifying. No, no running,

107
00:15:23,419 --> 00:15:31,240
no runny yolk. It gets all over everything. Hey, do you want eggs, this, this, and this?

108
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,759
Oh, sorry. What you meant to say was put egg all over all the stuff that I have. I want,

109
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:41,799
I want egg yolk all over everything that I have on my plate. Now separate it. I like having it with,

110
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:45,980
I like a jammy yolk because it's still a little runny, but it doesn't get everywhere.

111
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:53,450
I don't, I don't think that's such a weird take. You eat like a two-year-old.

112
00:15:54,169 --> 00:15:59,049
Enjoying jammy yolks is not a two-year-old thing. A two-year-old would be mommy, I want them

113
00:15:59,049 --> 00:16:08,629
scrambled. So no, I don't think that, I don't think your take is accurate. Oh, I hate these

114
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:24,490
guys. Geez, your attack patterns are fucking weird. 718 damage. Why would I even normally swing?

115
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,240
Why would I, why would I even swing the Katana if I'm doing that much damage?

116
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:40,919
Pests. All right, hold on. I can't look at that yet. You're making a mess when you shouldn't.

117
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:48,009
I mean, honest to God, this is the best. Is this, I don't know how this is scaling with my

118
00:16:48,009 --> 00:16:53,769
intelligence. That magic ability is unbelievably good. It's like, I'm like, I'm actually concerned

119
00:16:53,769 --> 00:17:08,180
they're going to nerf it. It's that good. 700 fucking damage versus like two or three hundred

120
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:13,210
damage a swing, 300 damage a swing. And then the range is unbelievable. That's getting nerfed.

121
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:35,059
Sword of the night and fire is better. It's 2000 damage. Really? Holy shit. Well, let's go.

122
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:44,410
He's, he's such a weirdo. I don't like this guy because he's, you know what I mean?

123
00:17:45,769 --> 00:17:52,460
Sometimes he'll go down, but he doesn't swing. Late game is stupid. So it makes sense.

124
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:58,759
Uh, okay. That's a good to know. So wait, that's like not crazy. I feel like it is though.

125
00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:10,900
Late game is nutty. Oh, all right. Well, I want these items and I don't care if I die because I,

126
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:15,299
I'm item run Andy. So I, I don't, I know like some people you've probably seen play this game. Just

127
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:35,099
look over here and go, I don't give a fuck. Hello. What is this thing? What? Oh my God,

128
00:18:35,099 --> 00:18:52,250
get out of here. Okay. Well, this is like a rot dragon. It really is just that guy that I,

129
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:57,289
how much health does he have? All right. Well, I can't literally going to die from the rot.

130
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,680
Damn. All right. Well, that's a kind of weird mini boss over there.

131
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:18,980
Uh, but look at how wise this guy is. He's got a white beard speckles. They just,

132
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:25,980
there aren't many bosses now. They're just normal mobs. Well, that's kind of nuts.

133
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:51,289
I got the items. So I'm wrong. What's going on? What's going on here? Come on. Fucking game

134
00:19:51,289 --> 00:20:05,589
crashed. The game just literally crashed. I hope that's not. No, my, it should be fine.

135
00:20:05,589 --> 00:20:21,460
Are we getting Fs? Well, we're getting, that was a hardware F because that almost just

136
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:34,089
crashed my whole computer. That was not an internet F. Yeah. That was a, that was a hardware F.

137
00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:54,789
And this is like not running well either. This is like bad. All right. Well, whatever. Yeah,

138
00:20:54,789 --> 00:21:12,470
I know, I know, I know. Whatever. Laugh my ass off. Elden Ring sucks. I think so. I just,

139
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:31,609
where the hell, where am I? Why am I over here? Why did he put me over here? What? My souls are

140
00:21:31,609 --> 00:21:44,420
over there. Yeah. My souls are down here. What level am I? 74. Yeah. I think the game like put

141
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:51,210
me in a different place because I died. I, I, this is exactly where I died. The game like

142
00:21:51,210 --> 00:22:06,170
crashed and like dumped me in another location. Oh well. All right. Let's go. Yeah. I mean, there

143
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:11,859
are, there are some technical issues sometimes with the game, but whatever. Not going to stop

144
00:22:11,859 --> 00:22:18,170
me from fucking playing. I don't even care about these souls really either. Was it like 5,000,

145
00:22:18,809 --> 00:22:26,299
2,000? Would you say that you loved it? Oh, it's actually 10,000. Nevermind.

146
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:31,849
Uh, would you say that you love this game? Um, I don't think I'd be playing it as much as I am

147
00:22:31,849 --> 00:22:49,099
if I didn't really, really easy for you guys to know that considering, uh, considering, um,

148
00:22:49,099 --> 00:22:58,950
how much I play games on this screen, me playing a video game for more than four hours and going,

149
00:22:59,589 --> 00:23:06,630
yeah, I'll play that tomorrow. Oh my God. Not paying attention. I played this game for more

150
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:09,430
than two screens in a row, which means it's like the best game that's ever been made.

151
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:19,799
There you go. Don't fucking crash again. Yeah. No, we're good. All right. No, okay. Come on.

152
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:29,450
These guys hurt a lot. What does it, what's the damage they're doing? They thrust. If German

153
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:35,289
nine eight five, that's me, is going to play your game for more than 10 hours on stream,

154
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:44,150
you've got something really special, real special. And that does not hold on. Let me make,

155
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:48,789
I got to be clear to you guys. That does not mean that I have some incredibly high standard

156
00:23:49,349 --> 00:23:56,309
like, wow, you impressing me. Wow. What a feat that is. No, I'm saying that it's so difficult

157
00:23:56,309 --> 00:24:03,829
to hold my attention on anything that you holding my attention is ridiculous. Like is

158
00:24:03,829 --> 00:24:09,450
really actually impressive because I stuff does not hold my attention that well. And it's not

159
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:13,130
because it doesn't matter how good or bad something is. I usually move on very quickly

160
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:28,140
to the next thing. These guys, I don't like these fucking things. What are the ego? No,

161
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:48,660
I'm saying, I'm telling you, it's not an ego thing. Okay. These guys do this. How many souls

162
00:24:48,660 --> 00:25:04,259
each? Jesus. That's a lot. You assert you refer to yourself in the third person. Yeah. I'm not,

163
00:25:04,259 --> 00:25:15,240
as a joke, I don't actually do that. That's, that was a huge burp. And if I opened my mouth,

164
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:29,880
I would have threw up. What a bad attention span. I do have had. I've had attention issues

165
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:36,700
my whole life, man. Even going into my forties, it's going to be, I'm not, I'm not 40 yet,

166
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:40,859
but you know what I mean? It's going to get even. I don't know. You know, I'm really concerned.

167
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,339
You wonder what my major concerns are kind of growing up and getting a lot older, older.

168
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:51,579
So I have really bad attention problems. I had my whole life. I've taken medication for it

169
00:25:51,579 --> 00:25:58,730
decades ago, right? I've always had, I had issues that way. When you get older, you slow down. So

170
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:05,210
when I'm into my like mid forties into my like mid fifties, as my brain starts to slow down,

171
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:10,630
am I going to be able to like to do it? Am I, am I going to be able to think about anything?

172
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:15,819
Like I'm going to have like bad ADHD and like dementia at the same time.

173
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:22,099
Like as everybody kind of slowly goes to that, like kind of like degrading brain into the like

174
00:26:22,099 --> 00:26:27,079
your fifties and sixties, that's going to be really strange. I'm going to, I'm going to make

175
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:29,960
sure I drink. I'm going to take a ton of vitamin E. Like I'm going to make sure I'm going to eat

176
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:45,000
fish like every day. Like seriously, take care of yourselves. What am I doing? I just aggroed the

177
00:26:45,000 --> 00:27:04,950
whole camp. What am I thinking? I'm good. Attention deficit, hyperactivity, dementia.

178
00:27:06,309 --> 00:27:18,299
I mean, I'll be honest. That seems like fuck. Like I don't know. I'm going to make sure I'm

179
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:53,019
going to take, like, I'm going to make sure I'm like eating right. Jesus. What the fuck? I thought

180
00:27:53,019 --> 00:27:55,500
he was behind the, I thought he was behind the pillar. I actually thought he was behind the

181
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:03,289
pillar. I changed that by the way. Made that to heal over time instead of the stamina because

182
00:28:03,289 --> 00:28:27,529
stamina is not a problem. You shouldn't be eating four McChickens. Guys. Okay. It's time for defense

183
00:28:27,529 --> 00:28:34,569
mode Andy. Just because my McDonald's order is a little elaborate is a little excessive.

184
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:48,019
That's what's going on. I thought that was an item. What's this? I don't order it every day.

185
00:28:48,819 --> 00:29:10,759
No, I'm not. I don't want to go down the fucking river. That'd be so. Okay. Huge missed opportunity

186
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:20,359
from FromSoftware. If you died, just showed up on screen right now. Just. Oh, that would be so funny.

187
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:33,220
What a missed opportunity. Unfortunately, I actually didn't want to go in there.

188
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:52,630
You eat McDonald's every day. Now what? He eats more than my whole family of five.

189
00:29:54,180 --> 00:30:01,799
I am not eating that much McDonald's. Where the fuck am I? This is going to be like a boss.

190
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:11,799
Please give me a bonfire so I can at least level up before I lose all these souls.

191
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:27,819
Look, I love McDonald's. It's McDonald's is the absolute best.

192
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:37,160
Nothing will ever compare. You know, it's kind of weird. I've been, I've been to five-star restaurants.

193
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:45,430
I've eaten five-star meals, but the way that my brain reacts to eating, like if I'm hungry,

194
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:53,670
a double cheeseburger from McDonald's, nothing compares. Like that, if I'm really hungry,

195
00:30:53,670 --> 00:31:00,710
double cheeseburger from McDonald's. Bam. That four seconds. One, two, three, four. Nothing

196
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:06,390
compares to that. And like, Oh, what's this? What's this? Oh, parsley dusted, um, chicken thigh,

197
00:31:06,869 --> 00:31:16,009
uh, I don't know. Whatever it is. And like, Oh, interesting. Interesting flavors.

198
00:31:17,289 --> 00:31:34,099
Into the napkin. What do you have? Fuck. I don't, there's no bonfire.

199
00:31:34,819 --> 00:31:43,500
There's a statue, but I'm going to lose 35,000 souls. No, I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it.

200
00:31:44,059 --> 00:31:56,329
I'm not doing it. I have a, I have a level. What would I throw a level away?

201
00:31:56,970 --> 00:32:08,599
That's an extra point in intelligence. Now I'm just going to run past everybody.

202
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:25,400
Do you have matcha today? Of course I do. Like there's, I would assume at this point,

203
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:31,099
there's more matcha powder fragments than red blood cells in my body. The last like two weeks.

204
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:45,079
Look, I'm in a public school bathroom. What are you talking about? Like right now? I don't know

205
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:55,750
many public school bathrooms that have like shelves with like video games on them, dude.

206
00:32:55,750 --> 00:33:14,329
Okay. Does this actually kill you? I need to see because if it doesn't, then I'm just going to do

207
00:33:14,329 --> 00:33:19,579
it. I'm just, no, it's going to kill me. Heat seeking missiles. Yeah. Then they shoot a thousand

208
00:33:19,579 --> 00:33:38,619
of them. They're talking about where the game is right now. Oh, that seems what public school

209
00:33:38,619 --> 00:34:13,510
bathroom. I swear to God, if that kills me again, crap, it was a chest here.

210
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:24,860
Scorpion stinger. Oh, that looks cool. Whatever that is. It's definitely not intelligence,

211
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:28,059
but it's probably so cool. I got to remember this for a future playthrough because that probably

212
00:34:28,059 --> 00:34:40,309
would really like this. It's a, it's a dagger. Also Scarlet rot buildup. Oh, and it's got,

213
00:34:40,309 --> 00:34:59,420
and it's got fuzz. This thing's hairy. This is awesome. And it does like, it's like stinger

214
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:17,929
flash. Oh, I like, want to use this. That's so cool. Scorpion. Very cool. Unfortunately,

215
00:35:18,969 --> 00:35:24,550
that's the kind of character I'm playing. That's where it is. If you're wondering

216
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:34,570
the grand cloister, it's the weapon info. Weapon info is fashion from a great scorpions tail

217
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:39,849
glistening with Scarlet rot, a ceremonial tool used by heretics crafted from the

218
00:35:39,849 --> 00:35:51,739
relic of a sealed outer God. Okay. So that's all I need to do there. Now I hope the flask

219
00:35:51,739 --> 00:35:57,900
allocation is good because this looks like a boss. So we're just going to go, I don't care about

220
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:11,769
those souls. Who cares? Go get in the coffin. It's literally like a thousand shares. It's

221
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:16,889
literally just a thousand shares. It doesn't matter. How many shares of that do I own of this?

222
00:36:16,889 --> 00:36:31,079
What do I mean shares? Stock Stanley. Okay. Here we go. Double headphones going in. Time for me

223
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:35,239
to pay attention. I appreciate everybody's help. I appreciate everybody's, you know,

224
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:39,159
Hey dude, you're doing pretty good. Hey dude, you're doing awful, but I'm going to have them

225
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:47,590
tuning you out for the next two or three straight minutes. There's a statue here so I can come back.

226
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:51,909
I have two, eight and two. I want, hopefully it's enough. I don't know.

227
00:36:53,300 --> 00:37:04,739
Uh, in the astell natural born of the void. Why does everybody have one of those?

228
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:12,500
Can I, can I complain? Why does every boss have that move? Have they all have it?

229
00:37:13,139 --> 00:37:27,099
They're like, welcome to the arena. Boom. This thing is great. It's like a whole solar system.

230
00:37:37,449 --> 00:37:45,019
A lot of big explosive AOE. You have to jump and hit. Yeah. You're going to jump.

231
00:37:45,739 --> 00:38:07,400
You're so big. I can't even. Oh my God. Okay. So that does one, two, three. Jesus. Okay.

232
00:38:09,059 --> 00:38:16,469
You have so many moves. Do you have that too? Okay. That's not magic. That's not magical at all.

233
00:38:17,429 --> 00:38:32,010
That's not magical at all. That was not magical at all. This is crazy looking boss though. Okay.

234
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:41,579
Well, very interesting. This is probably one of the cooler looking bosses. I think that they've

235
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:50,619
made, there was a tier list for interesting boss look like design a lot longer than that.

236
00:38:50,619 --> 00:39:00,329
I think this guy would be up pretty high. That's oh man. That's hard. It does like it comes down,

237
00:39:00,329 --> 00:39:29,699
but it doesn't hit Jesus. Okay. He goes like before he does it. Fuck. I was at a stamina.

238
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:48,969
Oh, maybe, maybe I shouldn't hit him in the face. Maybe I should hit him like inside. Oh my God. He

239
00:39:48,969 --> 00:40:09,460
doesn't like that. Oh, okay. He's got like, like 15 move, 20 plus moves and counting.

240
00:40:10,099 --> 00:40:23,900
This is going to be fun. He's just a nerd's rope. Oh yeah. Wicked coal dude. He's a nerd's rope with

241
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:43,079
like fangs. I think you can outrun it. Let me see if you can outrun it. Nerd's rope. Maybe like in

242
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:50,280
his back legs. I think, I think facing him head on is way too dangerous. Maybe I can like break one

243
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:55,639
of his little, he's got these like little crab legs. I should be able to break them. Maybe I can

244
00:40:55,639 --> 00:41:05,159
stun him. How are you supposed to get the fuck away from that? That's an instant kill. Of course,

245
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:10,679
of course this is Elden Ring. Every major boss has an instant kill move. Forgot. I forgot what

246
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:23,800
video game I was playing. Okay. I wonder, can I dodge that when he does it? Like right before

247
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:36,389
he does it. Maybe. I cannot use the horse here. Unfortunately, I'm still going to go for the legs.

248
00:41:36,389 --> 00:41:40,409
I think the back legs, he's got these little tiny little like lobster legs. I think I can probably

249
00:41:40,409 --> 00:42:03,500
like hurt them or break them. I don't think so. Maybe not. It's definitely his head. It's absolutely

250
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:41,619
his head that hurts the most. That little right in his cracked skull. Jesus. Fuck. Couldn't see

251
00:42:41,619 --> 00:42:53,030
where his arm was. I wonder how much, how much magic damage I'll do. Let's try it. Oh baby.

252
00:42:54,199 --> 00:44:36,090
That's a lot. Shit. Fuck. We're going now? Hey. All right. All right. All right. Where?

253
00:44:43,619 --> 00:45:02,139
What the fuck? Hey, yeah. That move sucks. I have that too. It's terrible. Shit. What the fuck is

254
00:45:02,139 --> 00:45:58,809
that thing? Oh, fuck you. Oh shit. In my pants. Oh my God. It did it fucking three times. Oh my God.

255
00:45:58,809 --> 00:46:05,769
It does it three times again. Get out. Get out. Don't, don't be over here. Get away from him.

256
00:46:05,769 --> 00:46:37,099
There's no reason to be there. Okay. That's what I was talking about. We're fine. Holy shit. What?

257
00:46:38,059 --> 00:46:41,179
Don't die from that. Don't die from that. I got enough. I got, I don't have enough.

258
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:52,250
He appeared fucking behind. I didn't know where he was going. All right. Well, I, here's the thing.

259
00:46:53,210 --> 00:47:10,500
Here's the thing. I can get him. I should have brought an extra. I'll get him. I thought I,

260
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:16,920
I thought I had him. All right. I'm getting it, but that sucks. It's too fast. All right. Let's go.

261
00:47:22,329 --> 00:47:31,369
I might, if I don't beat him in the next couple of tries, may. Dude, what the fuck are you doing,

262
00:47:31,369 --> 00:49:14,039
man? Oh, fuck. Oh, those explode. Breathe. That shit took up the whole script.

263
00:50:32,599 --> 00:50:39,159
Oh, fuck you, dude. It's so hard to know. I don't think I'm dead. I'm alive. Oh my God. Fuck that

264
00:50:39,159 --> 00:50:46,199
move, dude. Like he just, he appears fucking somewhere behind you and it's like you lose

265
00:50:46,199 --> 00:50:58,010
lock on and he's just right in your fucking face. That move is so stupid. Like, come on.

266
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:09,530
That's fucking dumb. That's stupid. Cause like where the fuck even is he going to be? He's

267
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:14,809
behind you. You lose lock on and then he's just right on your ass. Like, dude, I just,

268
00:51:14,809 --> 00:51:20,730
did I just spam dodge? He'll, he'll, he'll catch me. It's such fucking horse shit.

269
00:51:20,730 --> 00:52:08,440
I don't care. All right. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. It's just going to come down to like,

270
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:14,010
when he does that shit, I guess just no matter where he is, just like instantly dodge.

271
00:52:14,809 --> 00:52:40,619
I don't, I, I don't, I have no idea. Oh fuck. I did that twice in a row. Oh, I'm just tilting.

272
00:52:40,619 --> 00:52:49,619
It's over. Yeah, I'm just tilting. I'm just full tilt because that fucking dumb grab move.

273
00:52:50,420 --> 00:53:21,719
The gravity. No, the gravity move is not instant kill. It's just like an 80%.

274
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:30,219
The grab move might actually be instant kill or at least like 95% or something. I don't want to have

275
00:53:30,219 --> 00:55:17,130
30 vitality. That was the one too. It's just so fucking frustrating. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

276
00:55:19,639 --> 00:55:24,280
Oh, I didn't even look and I fucking got there. Where are they?

277
00:55:24,280 --> 00:57:56,090
Hey, where'd he go? What the fuck is that thing? Trying to bait out the face.

278
00:58:16,469 --> 00:59:30,889
Fuck. Where the fuck am I? Oh, bro. I'm alive. I'm going to be alive. I'm going to be alive.

279
00:59:30,889 --> 00:59:55,349
I'm going to be alive. What's happening? I'm against the fucking goddamn skybox wall.

280
00:59:55,349 --> 01:00:48,980
I'm against this. I'm against the wall. This is wall. Oh, fuck you game. No.

281
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:40,579
Oh, the game's fucking easy. It's not even a hard game. Instant kill moves are stupid. Delete them.

282
01:02:40,579 --> 01:02:43,300
Patch them out of the game. Instant kill moves are fucking deleted from the game. Instant kill

283
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:46,179
moves. You should never have put those in the game. They're fucking stupid. Nobody likes them.

284
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:57,420
Nobody, not one person likes them. You remember when Jay Leno used to walk around on the street

285
01:02:57,420 --> 01:03:01,420
and be like, oh, hey, so what do you think about like this? Hey, what do you think about like Chevy?

286
01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:04,619
Right? No, no, no. If it was like, oh, hey, I got a question for you. What do you,

287
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:08,219
in a video game, if something could kill you in one hit instantly,

288
01:03:09,179 --> 01:03:14,380
do you like it? No, no, and I don't know. No, Jay, Jay Leno, I don't like it. Oh, well,

289
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:17,659
we got another person here. What do you think about instant kill moves in games?

290
01:03:17,659 --> 01:03:21,420
I fucking hate them. They should never be in a video game. Oh, yeah, we're getting

291
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:39,420
interesting responses. I hate them. It's like one little move and it's like dad, dad, dad, dad,

292
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:47,909
dad. Even if it's not, I know that it is though. It is. Your health is just too low. He doesn't

293
01:03:47,909 --> 01:03:55,289
have any instant kill moves. Okay, if I chop you up in a meat grinder and the only thing that

294
01:03:55,289 --> 01:04:03,030
comes out and that's left of you is your eyeball, you're probably dead. You're probably going to,

295
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:08,630
not you, I'm just saying, like if somebody were to like push you into a meat grinder

296
01:04:09,590 --> 01:04:13,590
and like one of your finger bones is still intact, they're not going to pick it up and go,

297
01:04:13,590 --> 01:04:18,710
well, see, yeah, it wasn't an instant kill move. You still got like this part of your

298
01:04:18,710 --> 01:04:28,070
finger left. No, I'm not going to put you into a meat grinder. I'm not going to put you into a

299
01:04:28,070 --> 01:04:37,380
meat grinder. No, I'm making a reference to the fact that like if I, like if I were to get like

300
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:49,780
fucking killed, I don't know. You know what I'm saying? If, okay, if you were to, okay,

301
01:04:49,780 --> 01:04:58,920
we're going to take humans out of this. If alien glob glob glob go one fucking shoots a disintegrating

302
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:07,380
ray at alien glob glow two, if there's only fucking teeth left, it's, it's fucking, you're dead.

303
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:22,280
You're dead. If I were to put you in a meat grinder. God damn it. That's so fucked up.

304
01:05:30,519 --> 01:05:33,960
You understand what I'm saying though. I'm not actually saying I'm going to put somebody in a

305
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:58,710
meat grinder. God damn it. Let's go. What's the context? The context is if he does 95% of your

306
01:05:58,710 --> 01:06:05,590
health in one move, it's, it's still the same because who I want you to find, you all do me a

307
01:06:05,590 --> 01:06:12,250
favor. Find somebody that plays this game that has a hundred percent HP. No one's at 100% HP,

308
01:06:12,250 --> 01:06:18,809
100% HP. Usually people are at like 80 or like 90 or like 85 or nobody. You can never get it right.

309
01:06:20,949 --> 01:06:25,349
A 90 plus percent damage move is, is effectively killing you. It's you're dead.

310
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:36,380
MonkaS, I agree. I fucking, I had to use the meat grinder analogy, but it works.

311
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:58,539
Still not an instant kill. All right. Well, that was fun. I wonder if I should start doing this.

312
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:12,550
40. Let's play. Don't grind me up. No, whenever, okay. Whenever I say you, I mean like

313
01:07:13,429 --> 01:07:17,269
collectively, like a thing, right? Like you don't like, let me tell you something. You know,

314
01:07:17,269 --> 01:07:21,829
like I say, you know, like, you know, I don't actually, I don't actually know if you know,

315
01:07:21,829 --> 01:07:27,670
I'm just saying you like, yeah, like, you know, you collectively, you know, you like if you,

316
01:07:27,670 --> 01:07:32,150
you know, if you did, you know, if you trust me, no one's going to be cracked. I promise.

317
01:07:33,030 --> 01:08:11,699
Now what do I do? He means you specifically. I can go, I can go back. So what did I get? This

318
01:08:11,699 --> 01:08:21,399
is part of the quest or, oh, there's a place I can go. You're going to play the new destiny too.

319
01:08:22,039 --> 01:08:26,279
That joke was like three months in the making and it already happened. So I'm sorry. You're

320
01:08:26,279 --> 01:08:55,369
never going to see that ever again. Hey dude, like, um, it's actually not an instant kill move.

321
01:08:56,010 --> 01:08:58,010
If I want to put you in a meat grinder.

322
01:09:06,819 --> 01:09:11,699
Sorry. I didn't, I was just talking. I was like, I was speaking collectively, like just

323
01:09:11,699 --> 01:09:27,979
like a thing that happens. Oh man. God damn it. I, I'm going to take this to the grave though.

324
01:09:27,979 --> 01:09:36,819
Like 95, sorry, like 95 plus percent damage moves. I gotta move on. I gotta, I gotta,

325
01:09:36,819 --> 01:09:40,180
I'm sorry. I gotta move on right now. I have to, I'm going to move on right now.

326
01:09:40,739 --> 01:09:44,500
So we're going to continue to play. We're going to just keep playing. Elden ring,

327
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:49,539
Elden ring, no meat grinders. Nobody's going into meat grinder. Like I beat the boss. It was hard.

328
01:09:49,539 --> 01:09:54,260
He was crazy. I got a little tilted in the middle there, but no, there's no meat grinders anymore.

329
01:09:54,260 --> 01:10:08,569
Look at all these pigs. They're actually interesting. Stop it. Stop it. Okay. This is,

330
01:10:08,569 --> 01:10:12,170
I actually wanted to explore this area. Why don't we explore? Let's take a quick look around.

331
01:10:12,899 --> 01:10:16,819
Oh, look at this thing over here. We're going to mark some stuff on the map because that's what

332
01:10:16,819 --> 01:10:23,020
we do in Elden ring. Let's check out some stuff. A new zone. There's a few places I think look kind

333
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:28,439
of interesting here. Uh, there's a farm over there too, but guys, I think we're going to check this

334
01:10:28,439 --> 01:10:36,619
out first. I'm going to check that out first just to see what's over here. We'll start with, uh,

335
01:10:36,619 --> 01:10:51,020
this one. I think this is a church. Potentially get a sacred flask. What the fuck? I'm not,

336
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:56,380
I don't want to fight you. I don't want to fight a glint stone dragon right now.

337
01:10:58,939 --> 01:11:15,800
I just had a boss fight. Who did you just kill? Was that an NPC? I hope that wasn't an NPC. Oh my

338
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:28,680
God. Oh my God. That's a glint stone dragon. Of course, magic's not going to do well against a

339
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:45,529
glint stone dragon. What was I thinking? This is a really bad place to fight a dragon.

340
01:11:46,810 --> 01:12:16,359
Actually, I don't know what's going to happen here, but okay. That hurt. Am I fighting this

341
01:12:16,359 --> 01:12:22,359
thing? I'm still shook up from the last one. I do need my souls though. I want to see what's in

342
01:12:22,359 --> 01:12:35,939
there. Put them in the meek rider. It's going to take a while for, uh, I think this community

343
01:12:35,939 --> 01:12:54,680
to get over that one. Oh, it is a cathedral. Starlight shards. Starlight shards. Starlight

344
01:12:54,680 --> 01:13:08,090
shards. Starlight shards. These are everywhere. These, these are rare. They're purple lights.

345
01:13:08,729 --> 01:13:37,800
That means it's rare. Meat grinder apology. Okay, so let's get all these. Why not?

346
01:13:44,979 --> 01:13:49,539
These are a pretty rare resource. Starlight shards. I'm going to look it up in a minute,

347
01:13:49,539 --> 01:13:55,460
but let's get this. I already, dude, I wouldn't mean to apologize. I spent the last like 20

348
01:13:55,460 --> 01:14:01,699
straight minutes apologizing. We're talking about me grinding people, but my point still stood

349
01:14:01,699 --> 01:14:27,260
very solid, I think. Very cool. That was what was here. Ooh, wait a minute.

350
01:14:28,789 --> 01:14:41,270
There are ruins under here? There is. What? Am I dead? Am I going here?

351
01:14:44,659 --> 01:14:49,779
There's a ledge. There's a ledge. There's a ledge. There's a ledge. There's a ledge. There's a ledge.

352
01:14:50,739 --> 01:15:22,789
And I have Starlight. I'm going to put that on. Okay, let's do it. What just keeps dying here?

353
01:15:23,350 --> 01:15:54,140
Oh, thank God for Starlight. What is this thing? It's a hand. It's one of those fingers.

354
01:15:55,500 --> 01:16:16,380
Clear ring. This guy, all that's left of this guy is his fucking hand.

355
01:16:17,020 --> 01:16:22,380
All that a kill move? Is that an instant kill move? Or does his hand still exist?

356
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:28,420
All right, I'm moving on. No more talking about this. I'm kind of afraid of this. Should I put

357
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:35,510
the ring on? I don't want to put the ring on. All the ring rates will come get me. I feel like this

358
01:16:35,510 --> 01:17:05,979
is bad. Wait, that's Rena. Oh, I thought I was going to take that ring that she had on and take

359
01:17:05,979 --> 01:17:21,560
it off and put it on me. And look, this is so out of place. I look like I belong in like a fucking

360
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:41,590
Saturday morning funnies page in the paper. I don't belong in this scene. Oh, so Rena's back.

361
01:17:55,750 --> 01:18:00,569
To the night sky. It is there. I shall find mine order.

362
01:18:00,569 --> 01:18:08,390
Is this it? Travel the path of the Lord. And once all is done, we shall see each other

363
01:18:09,109 --> 01:18:23,220
once more. All right, very cool. Where's my reward? Here it is. Dark moon great sword.

364
01:18:23,460 --> 01:18:42,970
Dude, this is so but 16 strength. What is this? It's this. It's the from software weapon.

365
01:18:43,689 --> 01:18:52,869
This is how you get the moonlight great sword. It's the from software weapon. We found the

366
01:18:52,869 --> 01:19:06,500
from software weapon. OK, let's take a look at it. It's very pretty, isn't it? It is.

367
01:19:12,659 --> 01:19:13,699
It is very pretty.

368
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:26,970
That does not use manna, by the way. How long does it last? Oh, looks really cool here.

369
01:19:28,170 --> 01:19:49,109
I don't think you have an option here. I mean, I think I do have an option considering I need 16

370
01:19:49,109 --> 01:20:03,510
strength, which I'm going to have the intelligence for it is the intelligence weapon. Yeah, but

371
01:20:04,470 --> 01:20:11,340
intelligence weapon. Yeah, but but this is too. You can just two handed.

372
01:20:13,449 --> 01:20:16,729
Yeah, but then I'm essentially obliterating all my sorcerers.

373
01:20:17,930 --> 01:20:28,489
But on the strength talisman, this actually lasts a while. All right,

374
01:20:28,489 --> 01:20:38,310
so what happens if it's just it's just a normal 200? OK, I have some decisions to

375
01:20:38,310 --> 01:20:43,590
make because this is a big deal. I'm going to give you one reason why I'm not too keen on

376
01:20:43,590 --> 01:20:53,100
using this item because for the entire video game, I have been I have these swinging patterns

377
01:20:53,100 --> 01:21:02,279
down with the one handed and even two handed. It's a lot faster. I don't know. I'm going to

378
01:21:02,279 --> 01:21:15,689
have to get used to this all new swing timing for the big two hander. It's very cool. I don't know.

379
01:21:15,689 --> 01:21:26,250
I don't know. I don't know. It's a slow swinger. Yeah, I don't know. Well, let me finish this up.

380
01:21:26,970 --> 01:21:32,699
Let me just continue to do what I was doing here. That also is that going to make me heavy?

381
01:21:33,579 --> 01:21:46,310
This is important. Guys, I unless I don't have anything in my offhand, this is heavy. It's a heavy

382
01:21:46,310 --> 01:21:56,539
load. I'd have to start putting points in endurance. I can't have an offhand unless I respect. I don't

383
01:21:56,539 --> 01:22:07,899
think this is happening. I am more inclined to go into this than I am to that. This thing is pretty

384
01:22:07,899 --> 01:22:28,100
cool as well. It does this thing. This thing's awesome, but I don't know because that's strength

385
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:36,100
into not decks in, but it does. It does skill with decks. It does. And it's frost. All right.

386
01:22:36,100 --> 01:22:39,619
Well, we're going to have to do a lot of soul searching here. I think. Yeah, it's going to

387
01:22:39,619 --> 01:22:44,180
take some because this is what I'm going to take into the end game. Whatever I'm taking to the

388
01:22:44,180 --> 01:22:51,270
second half of this game is what I'm going to be using for the whole game. So this is going to be

389
01:22:51,270 --> 01:23:03,750
interesting because I actually don't know what to do here. But in the meantime, let's do this.

390
01:23:06,420 --> 01:23:23,079
Anything else down here? That was really cool. Quest line. In the meantime, I can go further.

391
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:32,520
I can go further down. Can I? I can. Wait, didn't I come from down? I think I came from this way.

392
01:23:33,239 --> 01:23:46,340
Yeah, okay. I did. What if I go back to Ren's rise? That's a good idea. You're going to get

393
01:23:46,340 --> 01:23:52,579
plenty of materials to spec several weapons really high. Yeah, but if this is like the other

394
01:23:52,579 --> 01:23:58,970
from software games, and I'm imagining it is because instant kill move, if it's like the other

395
01:23:58,970 --> 01:24:07,720
from software games, there's probably only like three or four of like the plus 10 or plus 20,

396
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:14,899
whatever item. So I'm imagining there's probably less than five or less than maybe even it was.

397
01:24:14,899 --> 01:24:21,159
There was two in each playthrough of Bloodborne. I remember like the super gigantic plus 10 item.

398
01:24:21,159 --> 01:24:30,119
I imagine there's probably two or three. There are more than four is four. Okay,

399
01:24:30,119 --> 01:24:33,750
so it's not like the other ones. Because I remember the other ones. It was like,

400
01:24:33,750 --> 01:24:39,899
you're going to find maybe two of like the super Titanite mega slabs. And that was it.

401
01:24:40,699 --> 01:24:44,779
Okay, so there's enough. All right, well, then it then it's not and I'm not worried about it,

402
01:24:44,779 --> 01:24:57,829
then. I want to keep exploring this area though. And that I didn't. Yeah, I want to check out some

403
01:24:57,829 --> 01:25:00,949
of this other stuff. Because I'm probably not coming back to this island ever again.

404
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:12,300
But if you're wondering how to get the moonlight great sword, like you don't feel like looking at

405
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:26,359
a guide. It's Ren's quest line. That was a long winded journey. Get us to a spot that I'm not

406
01:25:26,359 --> 01:25:45,659
entirely sure. I don't know if I wanted to use it. Okay, well, all right. Oh, golden. Oh,

407
01:25:46,779 --> 01:26:07,800
is this one single person? It's one single person. Holy shit. Yeah, I did not take that seriously

408
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:16,920
enough. Why did I start freaking out? Where's this going to take me? I just like Don Shalani

409
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:22,710
just was doing that. Okay. Um, where's this going to take me? Should I do it? Was there a statue?

410
01:26:23,189 --> 01:26:41,699
Or is this going to take me back way before? I don't know. I don't remember. Okay. Yeah,

411
01:26:41,699 --> 01:26:50,170
it's here. Well, all right. No, do not do not just nonchalantly walk through that area. I want to,

412
01:26:50,170 --> 01:27:04,810
I want to be in there. Ooh, that's pretty nice. All right. All right. I want to go underground.

413
01:27:04,810 --> 01:27:09,670
There's definitely a dungeon here that I'm going to do. And after I do this island, I'm going to go

414
01:27:09,670 --> 01:27:18,810
do a main story place, which I'm going to go to Caleb, I think, and go up from Caleb. That's my

415
01:27:18,810 --> 01:27:27,960
plan. You don't like my plan and don't care. All right, let's take this more seriously.

416
01:27:35,979 --> 01:27:58,180
Oh, my. Okay. I got stuck in the wall. Okay. You can't even be in the game. He's just like

417
01:27:58,180 --> 01:28:05,430
fucking out and freaking out. Okay. Damn. All right. Well, let's try this again.

418
01:28:06,149 --> 01:28:13,850
Let me get off the horse. I feel like maybe that's far better. Or is it though?

419
01:28:14,489 --> 01:28:30,010
So many people spawn here. All right, let's go. Here's all right. Here's behind you.

420
01:28:35,979 --> 01:28:58,390
Jesus. Oh, he's making the bird sounds by the way. He's making the from software bird reverse

421
01:28:58,390 --> 01:29:15,420
suck in breathing sound. Holy shit. Dude, I don't even know when I should attack him.

422
01:29:16,140 --> 01:29:49,899
Strobe into a fucking telephone pole. Fuck man. Where is he? I'm alive. But no, Jesus. Okay.

423
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:07,659
I want to kill this guy just because he's fucking irritating. Get off the horse. Oh, I think that

424
01:30:07,659 --> 01:30:13,159
is guaranteed death. You see how fast this guy moves around and he like teleports. No way you

425
01:30:13,159 --> 01:30:31,000
fight this guy off the horse. I'll dodge roll once and get killed. Dude. Oh, my God. This is

426
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:44,380
harder than some of the bosses. I'm parry him. I don't think there's anything to parry. Look,

427
01:30:44,939 --> 01:30:50,220
get off the horse, please. I'm telling you right now. I'm going to die in literally one second.

428
01:30:51,180 --> 01:31:20,470
If I get off the horse, but I'll do it. I can't even fucking take a second to drink.

429
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:42,840
I can't even take a sip of my fucking flask. I wish I could summon a friend here.

430
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:51,619
All right. We're going to stay on the horse because there's no way I'm going to reliably

431
01:31:51,619 --> 01:31:57,060
and he'll teleport behind me and kill me and you'll have a complaint and I don't think you

432
01:31:57,060 --> 01:32:14,140
want to hear me complain. He literally blended into the ground. I can't even get up. What the

433
01:32:17,340 --> 01:32:31,050
how did he get over that? How did he get over the wall? All right. I'm, I'm thinking I'm taking

434
01:32:31,050 --> 01:32:42,710
out my, I'm thinking my, my boy, my boy, all legs coming out here. No, you know what?

435
01:32:42,710 --> 01:33:17,529
Let's bring out the boys. We can be annoying too. Oh shit. Where is he? Where is he? Oh my God.

436
01:33:29,180 --> 01:33:49,500
Ah, I can't, which enemy is he? No, get away from me. There's so much fucking shit in the way too.

437
01:33:49,500 --> 01:34:22,310
Like seriously, like how am I supposed to this enemy? Wait, can he get, can he get up here?

438
01:34:22,310 --> 01:35:15,289
Yeah, he can. Yeah. Mother fucker. When can I even attack him? Fuck off. What an asshole.

439
01:35:15,930 --> 01:35:25,670
What an asshole of an enemy. Oh, good thing I got the ghost glove or no, no, no, please.

440
01:35:41,159 --> 01:35:48,550
Ooh, there's a, uh, one of those things. Wash your hands. I, what do you want me to do?

441
01:35:49,189 --> 01:35:57,850
Okay. I'll wash my, I'll wash up in a minute. What? I'm, I'm, I'm sitting here.

442
01:36:01,340 --> 01:36:03,180
Wait, you guys want me to go wash my hands?

443
01:36:06,739 --> 01:36:15,430
Should I go wash my hands? I'm only, no one's touching this besides me and I'm going to clean

444
01:36:15,430 --> 01:36:24,439
it with alcohol wipes after this. Don't worry. You must, should I go wash my hands?

445
01:36:25,159 --> 01:36:29,319
What if I, what? No, this is where this is, this is where this goes wrong. If I go wash my hands

446
01:36:29,319 --> 01:36:35,989
right now, I've grabbed onto this. I need to wash the controller. Did you get it? I have to

447
01:36:35,989 --> 01:36:43,140
wash the controller too. I'm going to do that afterwards. My monitor is not covered. It's just,

448
01:36:43,140 --> 01:37:10,939
it looks fine. All right. I want to do this. I don't know why this is here. What? What was that

449
01:37:10,939 --> 01:37:43,100
for? What was that for? That took a long time. Why did that take so long? All right. Something

450
01:37:43,100 --> 01:38:02,229
cool. Let's go. It's really an Amber medallion plus two. Holy shit. That's a hundred percent

451
01:38:02,229 --> 01:38:49,220
more mana vastly raises maximum FP. Wait. Oh, 10. Why is this even in the game? This is the plus

452
01:38:49,220 --> 01:39:01,899
two version of this. How many levels is 11 FP? So it's 10%. I mean, that's maybe one point,

453
01:39:01,899 --> 01:39:22,220
maybe two points. Maybe I don't, I wouldn't consider that fast. About two levels.

454
01:39:26,329 --> 01:39:32,949
That's three or four. It's three or four points. That's, that's really not a big debt, but how

455
01:39:32,949 --> 01:39:36,550
good some of the other talismans are in the game, there's no reason to put that on ever.

456
01:39:38,819 --> 01:39:43,699
I could see how that would maybe be okay if you were putting like more than 20, 30 plus points

457
01:39:43,699 --> 01:39:50,970
in mind, but why would you ever do that? I can't think of a reason why you'd have more than like

458
01:39:50,970 --> 01:40:08,779
40 points in mind. It's fine. I used to, I used to key for that. You said this fake wall is there.

459
01:40:12,470 --> 01:40:32,460
Are you fucking with me? Yeah, you're fucking with me. Please. Can you do a quick

460
01:40:33,340 --> 01:40:41,880
Seinfeld routine about the word vast? What even is vast? What's that supposed to mean? Vast.

461
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:50,199
Just say big, just say large, say big. Why do we need names for so why do we have so many names

462
01:40:50,199 --> 01:41:25,529
to describe what is effectively big? Just say big. Oh my god, it's bear. That was horrible.

463
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:31,899
He screamed at me. All right, what was it? There was a couple other places I'm going to go. I'm

464
01:41:31,899 --> 01:41:52,630
going to go here to, uh, he vastly underperformed. He didn't perform well. He largely underperformed

465
01:41:53,270 --> 01:41:59,750
the vast ocean. It's a big ocean. The ocean's big. That's a good one. It really is.

466
01:42:00,550 --> 01:42:05,939
As you know, he would like stay that way. He would move his hand, move his hand like this.

467
01:42:06,500 --> 01:42:16,220
I don't want to fight this thing. I was going to look at the rooms. Is there something under here

468
01:42:16,220 --> 01:42:37,529
that has to be, there has to be something here. That's not just look at. Yeah, of course.

469
01:42:38,329 --> 01:42:49,739
There's something here underneath, under the ground, up above something. Oh, we already.

470
01:42:49,739 --> 01:42:57,289
Yep. Yep. Nevermind. I already did this. I would do this. Oops. Sorry about that. All right,

471
01:42:57,289 --> 01:43:14,810
we need to go here and here and okay. Yeah. One and four. Let's go. Oh, yuck. That's going to,

472
01:43:14,810 --> 01:43:31,380
I'm going to die if I do that. Don't be stupid. I'll go to one and do it. It's Donald and it's

473
01:43:31,380 --> 01:43:46,220
going to be. Is your shirt drenched? I don't think so. It probably isn't. I haven't been

474
01:43:46,220 --> 01:43:59,020
playing for that long. Just de-aggro please. My shirt is not drenched. It's fucking fine. See.

475
01:44:10,390 --> 01:44:20,220
What? Is this a different dragon? Why is he here now? What? Why are there two? Why are there two

476
01:44:20,220 --> 01:44:30,409
of them? Is this a different person? Well, that, you're not fighting me. Is it a different dragon?

477
01:44:30,409 --> 01:44:36,149
This one doesn't have a health bar thing. Okay. That's just an enemy, but what?

478
01:44:36,869 --> 01:44:46,359
That one doesn't have. Oh my God. It is a different dragon. They're everywhere. What?

479
01:44:47,770 --> 01:45:02,600
I'm sorry, but excuse me. Holy shit. Don't die from that. I'm fine. The island of dragons.

480
01:45:04,460 --> 01:45:18,579
All right. Now we go this way. Not these guys again. No, you know what? Fuck off.

481
01:45:21,319 --> 01:45:25,100
No, I'm not fighting any of these people. I do like the

482
01:45:28,939 --> 01:45:45,850
they make a really cool sound. What are you doing here? This is the island of mini bosses. Okay. I'm

483
01:45:46,729 --> 01:46:10,680
smithing stone. I'm safe right here. Oh, he's coming in. He's getting in. He's getting in.

484
01:46:25,289 --> 01:46:30,779
Oh fuck. He got in. He got in. Okay. Now we can't get out. This is perfect.

485
01:46:53,640 --> 01:47:21,739
What the fuck? This island might be too hard for you. No, that was not that sound. That was

486
01:47:21,739 --> 01:47:27,560
a different one. There's got to be a better way I can get down here. I don't want to go all the

487
01:47:27,560 --> 01:47:40,329
way around. That was not the dude. That was the crystal people. The guy with the spear that goes

488
01:47:40,329 --> 01:47:52,199
wham, wham, wham. That's what he does. It's a different character. Grow up. Okay. Now I'm

489
01:47:52,199 --> 01:48:09,270
going to wrap around. I'm going to be telling us to grow up. It should be you that grows up.

490
01:48:09,270 --> 01:48:17,380
I'm already grown up. I'm a grown up. You're not a grown up. I'm a grown up. I'm just a

491
01:48:17,380 --> 01:48:36,380
spell off the edge. I've got to go all the way around. There's no safe way. And what? Be old

492
01:48:36,380 --> 01:48:42,779
like you? I'm not even old. You can say that in five years. Because then, you know, I'll be into

493
01:48:42,779 --> 01:49:02,550
my early 40s. But I'm not old right now. I'm a young man. I'm into skateboarding. Okay, I don't

494
01:49:02,550 --> 01:49:09,960
want to get killed here. That's 20,000 souls. I got to go get it. God, I can't just leave it.

495
01:49:11,560 --> 01:49:22,680
That'd be such a, but like what a like fucking idiot that would be. Motherfucking idiot. That

496
01:49:22,680 --> 01:49:41,659
would be if I didn't go get these souls. What level is the character? 74? 25? Why are my souls

497
01:49:41,659 --> 01:50:02,329
over here? Didn't I die like way the other way? Oh, I forgot to get eye drops. There's other items

498
01:50:02,329 --> 01:50:16,020
that I got to get there too. Remember, you're stuck in your ways. Um, I don't think so.

499
01:50:21,640 --> 01:50:31,270
I thought he just jumped off the cliff. He did. Can they not jump off the cliff? Will he not fall

500
01:50:31,270 --> 01:50:49,159
off? They like programmed that in. Don't fuck with me. I just want the stones. He's just right behind

501
01:50:49,159 --> 01:50:57,100
me. Okay, now we go down to the church because there's definitely something there. I'm not

502
01:50:57,100 --> 01:51:12,300
fighting this guy. Are you actually going to follow me down here? What's the Elden Ring? Does it let

503
01:51:12,300 --> 01:51:17,000
you fly? I don't think you can fly when you put on the Elden Ring. I'm not even sure what the

504
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:25,079
Elden Ring is. The Elden Ring might just be a like theory or something like a myth. It probably is

505
01:51:25,079 --> 01:51:48,949
no Elden Ring. How could something like that powerful be able to exist? Okay, I believe so

506
01:51:48,949 --> 01:52:01,399
here we are. What is this? We have a Bobby Hill impression. I'll try. Yeah. Hey dad, I'm sorry.

507
01:52:01,399 --> 01:52:09,689
I can't, but I tried. Seek three great wise turtles. Seek three wise turtles.

508
01:52:09,689 --> 01:52:23,319
I hate having to face game one. Could they be anywhere on the whole island?

509
01:52:24,500 --> 01:52:32,649
Because if that's the case, then I'm just going, I'm just going to fucking... Does this count? No,

510
01:52:32,649 --> 01:52:38,439
this is not, this is not a magical turtle. It could be anywhere on the whole island. Are you kidding me?

511
01:52:39,399 --> 01:52:48,779
They are everywhere. They can be anywhere on the whole island. Dude, there's not a chance I'm going

512
01:52:48,779 --> 01:53:20,569
to do this. Three. Okay, I need to find three. Oh my goodness, I found one. What am I supposed to do

513
01:53:20,569 --> 01:53:48,180
about it? I can't target it. I can't target it. That's so sad. Oh, there's one. If they're that big,

514
01:53:48,180 --> 01:53:50,979
then they have to be around there then. All right, I'm just going to go around the perimeter.

515
01:53:52,630 --> 01:54:04,250
What a pain in the ass. I also need to do this too. People are going to think I'm nuts, but I don't

516
01:54:04,250 --> 01:54:36,140
care. There was one here. I'm going to just mark where I've been because I will just walk in circles.

517
01:54:36,140 --> 01:54:53,640
There's nothing here. All right, where's this on the map? All right, there's nothing here or there.

518
01:55:03,130 --> 01:55:33,500
Okay, nothing here. I don't see anything over all the way over here.

519
01:55:44,119 --> 01:56:08,979
Yeah, that's nothing, man. You're stressing me out, dude. And this should be not stressing you

520
01:56:08,979 --> 01:56:24,869
out because I'm actually marking where I've actually seen. Look at the other towers down

521
01:56:24,869 --> 01:56:34,010
here. So why are you assuming that they're all on the edge? I don't know because they're huge

522
01:56:34,810 --> 01:56:41,720
and that's really I can't think of any other place to hide them. It's one of these things.

523
01:56:55,989 --> 01:57:05,029
Okay. Okay, so take a look at this. I can see this whole line. I don't see anything on this edge.

524
01:57:05,590 --> 01:57:13,140
Nothing here. Oh my god. Fuck this. This is going to be such a pain in the ass.

525
01:57:14,020 --> 01:57:26,970
I removed this. I don't want to individually. It's gonna be such a huge pain in the ass to

526
01:57:26,970 --> 01:57:33,770
individually remove all these. I don't want to remove all markers. I have stuff marked that I

527
01:57:33,770 --> 01:58:04,840
don't want removed. Okay, we're gonna go over there. But this thing is here. Let's go. What's

528
01:58:04,840 --> 01:58:30,760
this? It's a boss, right? Electro black knife ring leader. Holy shit, dude. Jesus. Okay. Well,

529
01:58:30,760 --> 01:58:40,539
that was interesting. Okay, didn't feel like didn't feel like he wanted to stop attacking.

530
01:58:40,539 --> 01:58:52,789
I feel like this is a backstab encounter. Maybe like a backstab. 18k souls gone. They're right

531
01:58:52,789 --> 01:59:11,479
here. They're right there. All right, this guy's got some moves. We'll try the we'll try some of

532
01:59:11,479 --> 01:59:27,029
the intelligence explosions. It's pretty that's pretty good. I think I can get a backstab. But

533
01:59:27,109 --> 01:59:39,720
holy fucking moly. Holy shit. All right. So when he jumps in the air like that, that's when you go

534
01:59:39,720 --> 02:00:10,649
around. That's when you get the backstab. You dodge through it. And then wham. Dude,

535
02:00:15,029 --> 02:00:18,149
he's a cool dad. This is cool. This is kind of like, oh, hey, look, this is a boss right here.

536
02:00:30,489 --> 02:00:49,939
Well, I didn't get it. I don't think I was close enough. We're done. Wow, that that lasts a long

537
02:00:49,939 --> 02:01:07,819
time. That lasts a lot longer than I thought it did. Dude, fucking stop swinging at me.

538
02:01:11,189 --> 02:01:53,909
No, I got it wrong. No, I went for it. All right, I'll get it done. Yeah, you can't.

539
02:01:55,100 --> 02:01:59,500
You cannot get the amount of iframes needed to dodge that attack. So you have to run.

540
02:02:00,619 --> 02:02:25,739
Summon somebody. Not until I understand what this guy's all about. They don't seem to give

541
02:02:25,739 --> 02:02:32,739
you very many opportunities to attack this guy. I can't summon. Oh, I think this is going to be

542
02:02:32,739 --> 02:03:01,500
one of those fights where I just run away. Damn, but I had it. Jesus, what the fuck?

543
02:03:02,220 --> 02:03:20,439
That's huge. That's a massive area. Okay. Yeah, I'm gonna try parrying a little parry shield.

544
02:03:30,359 --> 02:03:48,460
What shield is the best parry? I'm not sure it matters. You need a buckler. Don't go there

545
02:03:48,460 --> 02:03:57,270
without touching that. I'll try him one or two more times. Try parry him. He just he's very

546
02:03:57,270 --> 02:04:02,460
elaborate with his moves. He does a lot of just regular swings. I wonder how effective it'll be.

547
02:04:02,460 --> 02:04:24,119
Let's find out. That was weird. Cute. Time to do that. Jesus, man. He's just it's just almost no

548
02:04:24,119 --> 02:04:48,569
opportunity to attack him. If I could get the parry is just whatever. I just want to get a

549
02:04:48,569 --> 02:04:55,319
successful parry so I can know if I can do it later. You should just shoot him. Oh, yeah, I like

550
02:04:56,279 --> 02:05:06,600
Elden Ring added like machine guns and like like handguns. Got that wrong.

551
02:05:13,369 --> 02:05:22,409
Swing timings are so all over the place. It's like it's hard to even understand when to do this.

552
02:05:23,050 --> 02:05:33,880
I could try the guard. No, the guard parry would be horrible because if I did I'm just he just

553
02:05:33,880 --> 02:05:46,340
attacked me and kill me. I just want to parry him once and that will be my victory and then I'll

554
02:05:46,340 --> 02:05:54,710
leave. I just need to parry him one time. That's how I win this encounter. That's a victory for me.

555
02:05:55,350 --> 02:06:05,460
I thought I was gonna die. I thought he was gonna dash forward. No fucking way, dude. This guy's

556
02:06:05,460 --> 02:06:27,079
unbearable. No way. Five more attempts. That's it. I just want to parry him. Five attempts to

557
02:06:27,079 --> 02:06:45,140
parry him. That's not what you're betting on, I don't think. Just one parry. All right, get over

558
02:06:45,140 --> 02:06:56,810
here. It looks like a parry once. That looks pretty good. That looks pretty good. Didn't it,

559
02:06:56,810 --> 02:07:05,640
though? I don't understand. I don't know how you get away from that. I really don't get it.

560
02:07:05,640 --> 02:07:29,720
What do you do? Good fucking luck. I didn't mean to press the button twice. I just did.

561
02:07:30,600 --> 02:07:40,939
No fucking way. Okay, if you if you can parry this guy like three or four times in a row and

562
02:07:40,939 --> 02:07:46,140
like not get hit, you're from a different planet. You have to be. I would actually like start to

563
02:07:46,140 --> 02:07:53,590
contemplate like what potential alien species you could be. Now I'd be like I have fucking super

564
02:07:53,590 --> 02:08:11,420
human intelligence. I must be from a different planet. I have to be. Yes, but what is your

565
02:08:11,420 --> 02:08:18,100
reasoning for trying to join the Mensa Academy? The streamer said he was going to meet around a

566
02:08:18,100 --> 02:08:23,220
bunch of people told me that I had a super genius IQ because I could parry this boss and Elden wing

567
02:08:23,220 --> 02:08:33,140
three times in a row. Any mathematics or any English or any medical background? No. I just

568
02:08:33,140 --> 02:08:37,220
got shit faced one night and was able to parry this guy three times and this streamer told me

569
02:08:37,220 --> 02:08:59,670
who's the streamer? What are you talking about? I don't think you can. I don't think you can.

570
02:09:00,470 --> 02:09:10,819
Can you parry him? Like, I mean, at some point you just like guess at some point. Jesus.

571
02:09:11,539 --> 02:09:21,260
At some point just guess. I'm not even trying to fight the boss. Those are the bit what's he doing?

572
02:09:22,539 --> 02:09:26,060
I'm just trying to parry. That's the only thing I'm doing and I'm leaving when I get

573
02:09:26,699 --> 02:09:34,119
one. People people come to the stream and they see a guy like I don't understand what's happening.

574
02:09:34,119 --> 02:09:37,000
It's like that's what happens. You give your friend the control. You're like hey play Elden

575
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:44,260
ring. They're going to be like what's uh what do I do man? What should I go? I'm telling you I'm

576
02:09:44,260 --> 02:10:11,430
just practicing parrying. This guy's fucking moves are impossible to predict. What? I mean honestly

577
02:10:11,430 --> 02:10:32,020
though like holy shit man it's fucking crazy. I'm gonna I'm not leaving until I get a parry once.

578
02:10:32,899 --> 02:10:41,899
I'm not leaving this area until I like get it. I just want and then I'm going to alt f for the

579
02:10:41,899 --> 02:11:22,090
game and then come back right with one eye. It'll be easier. Fine. I looked like I hit it.

580
02:11:24,310 --> 02:11:53,510
That second one I think I hit it. I don't think I can parry him. He's a smaller shield. Okay.

581
02:11:53,989 --> 02:12:25,029
Last try. Last try. That's it and I'm not coming back. No. Fuck you. No I'm going out. I'm going

582
02:12:25,029 --> 02:13:07,800
out on my own terms. Hey wait where does it say my souls are? Wait why am I all the way over here?

583
02:13:07,800 --> 02:13:24,810
I oh I chose the bonfire. Fuck. Oh well that's it. I'm not going back. I'm not going back to that

584
02:13:24,810 --> 02:13:43,109
guy ever again. Jumping by past the stake. Oh that sucks. I still where just tell me what the

585
02:13:43,109 --> 02:13:47,340
turtles are. I don't even care. I'm not gonna sit around for four hours looking around this

586
02:13:47,340 --> 02:13:50,380
whole island for the turtles. Where are the other two turtles? Tell me. I just tell me where they

587
02:13:50,380 --> 02:14:06,250
are. I don't want I don't care. No I want four hours of suffering. Just tell I just where are

588
02:14:06,250 --> 02:14:10,329
the turtles? Where are they? Somebody said one of them's flying. That would be really funny but I

589
02:14:10,329 --> 02:14:20,460
don't I don't think I believe you. Why are they throwing frisbees at me? Stop. One is literally

590
02:14:20,460 --> 02:14:35,779
flying. No it's not. What is this? Is that gonna kill me? Okay I was supposed to be so upset.

591
02:14:36,420 --> 02:15:02,390
What is that one? What's that for? Wait could I where was that? Why is it gone? What the fuck

592
02:15:02,390 --> 02:15:27,909
is it for? Mark that. Where is it? Fortnite bounce pad dude. I just need to get down there.

593
02:15:27,909 --> 02:15:42,859
I just need to get down there. Get down there. I just walked up the edge. I just want to go down.

594
02:15:44,020 --> 02:16:03,989
Thank you. All right where's the turtle? Where is he? Tell me now. There's a shitload of turtles

595
02:16:03,989 --> 02:16:25,819
right here. Why are there so many turtles here? Seal on the rise opened. What? What's the rise?

596
02:16:35,139 --> 02:17:05,879
I did it? I did it. I did? Aren't there three? You broke the encounter. Oh all right what did I do?

597
02:17:06,760 --> 02:17:12,629
It was no it was three. It was three turtles. It says find three wise beasts. One big or it's three

598
02:17:12,629 --> 02:17:19,079
small turtles or one big turtle. Where was the big turtle? Wasn't the big turtle on the cliff?

599
02:17:20,120 --> 02:17:34,100
I'm very confused how I'm allowed in here right now. It was in the air.

600
02:17:34,100 --> 02:17:49,350
I didn't see it. This is kind of a spooky place. They were in the sky. Oh it's on my head.

601
02:17:50,520 --> 02:18:17,260
Um a bug or something. I wonder what this was all for. It's gonna be for

602
02:18:17,260 --> 02:18:39,899
or something. That's gold and he's dark moon. 68 intelligence at 45.

603
02:18:40,620 --> 02:18:51,209
Uses the caster as oh it's the thing where you go into the moon. That um that caster boss.

604
02:18:52,090 --> 02:19:03,690
I wonder how good that is. All right I think I've pretty much fully explored this island.

605
02:19:04,500 --> 02:19:08,500
There's like three dragons here but I don't care. I'm not gonna fight them right now

606
02:19:09,459 --> 02:19:23,459
or ever. So time to make a decision. Up from Kaleid or kind of up right from the uh manor.

607
02:19:23,459 --> 02:19:36,540
Carry manor. I have two choices here. Up from Kaleid or right. You know I don't I actually

608
02:19:36,540 --> 02:19:45,819
don't even really care. I would do either one of these. I'm gonna take a quick quick pee break.

609
02:19:46,379 --> 02:19:57,979
Let me get a poll in chat. Right from manor. Up from Kaleid. Right from manor which is this way

610
02:19:57,979 --> 02:20:05,319
or up from Kaleid. Get a poll going. I'll take a quick BRB. Gonna pee. Gonna refill my drink.

611
02:20:05,319 --> 02:27:03,290
And I'll see you guys in a bit. See you in like two minutes. I got 50 subs an hour ago. Rock Lee.

612
02:27:03,290 --> 02:27:13,219
Thank you. That's a lot. I still owe subs which maybe I'll try that again. Hopefully I got that

613
02:27:13,219 --> 02:27:24,059
sorted too but we'll see. So where are we going? What are the uh what was the general consensus?

614
02:27:26,090 --> 02:27:48,979
63% said up from Kaleid. Okay. Okay. Sounds like plan. 27% said uh hard to do do.

615
02:27:49,620 --> 02:28:12,139
That wasn't an option so sorry. Right. Sound effects on. And we go. So up from Kaleid.

616
02:28:12,139 --> 02:28:22,840
That sounds like plan. Very cool. Very interested. Also according to the notes,

617
02:28:25,780 --> 02:28:29,780
the dragon no we're already we're there. That's just that's not gonna happen.

618
02:28:30,940 --> 02:28:38,459
That's way later. Kaleid's not dragon barrel. I really hope this bowling pin isn't gonna be your

619
02:28:38,459 --> 02:28:43,500
hat always. I don't know. I don't know. It's by far the best intelligence hat that I found so far

620
02:28:43,500 --> 02:28:51,540
because specifically it does not reduce my stamina like the other ones do. All right let's go. I'm

621
02:28:51,540 --> 02:29:15,420
just gonna go up from here. So this way which would be actually this way. All right. Okay let's

622
02:29:15,420 --> 02:29:32,629
go. Swamp of Aeonia. Yeah really can I go this way? This is rot. This is another rot area. Okay

623
02:29:32,629 --> 02:29:45,450
it's not. Oh I remember these guys. Yeah I was freaking out about these guys before.

624
02:30:02,120 --> 02:30:46,700
He's dropping gold. Uh-huh. Okay. Come here. Mm-hmm. It's just like the rabbit from Mario 64.

625
02:30:46,700 --> 02:30:51,659
What? Fuck. Oh scarlet rot. Wait. Stand over here. Where is he? What's this pattern?

626
02:31:01,370 --> 02:31:31,510
Where this pattern is? So wait. Hold on. Am I stupid? What? Am I stupid? I'm going up here

627
02:31:31,510 --> 02:31:46,059
is what I can actually see. I mean obviously right like come on. What the fuck happened?

628
02:31:47,000 --> 02:32:09,129
What? Oh I had scarlet rot. I'm so locked in. Stop by the shack at the southern gate.

629
02:32:09,770 --> 02:32:44,420
Okay. What if I like block? Where are you going? Where are you going? What? You don't go this way

630
02:32:44,420 --> 02:34:08,260
anymore? Fuck you. What? I don't get it. Come here you little shit. Got him. Poison armament.

631
02:34:08,260 --> 02:34:25,530
Uh-oh. Fellas. Hold on. Poison armament. Oh all right. I gotta go up that way I think right.

632
02:34:25,530 --> 02:34:37,500
It's useless. Is it? It's useless? All right. I'm going kind of the right way but I almost

633
02:34:37,500 --> 02:34:47,700
want to go that way. I want to follow the uh golden thing. Celia tower of sorcery.

634
02:34:48,260 --> 02:35:00,649
What's wrong here? I can't go this way. I guess not. So this is like I guess progression but

635
02:35:00,969 --> 02:35:27,110
I can't go in there. Why not? Why not? Shit. I can't go in here.

636
02:35:29,739 --> 02:35:46,940
Are you firing at me? You can go up there. All right. I'm gonna do some rooftop jumping here.

637
02:35:46,940 --> 02:37:05,180
Is that a hole? Oh yes. Hi. I'm Sigurd. All up there. My god. All right. Stop. Stop. All right.

638
02:37:20,069 --> 02:38:05,399
Oh fuck. Get the fuck out of here dude. Stop. I just want to get up here. What's in here? Another

639
02:38:05,399 --> 02:38:25,000
entrance I can't get in. You are such a shitty little enemy too and like I get out of here with

640
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:39,610
this bullshit and you disappeared too. I gotta get back on the roof. I want to go get those items.

641
02:38:39,610 --> 02:39:22,440
Item Andy. Item Andy. Item Andy. I know. Okay back to the tree. Fuck. I think I can do it from here.

642
02:39:23,079 --> 02:39:35,209
If I didn't have somebody up my ass I would be able to do it. I didn't have somebody constantly

643
02:39:35,209 --> 02:39:52,040
up my ass I'd be able to do it. I can't stop. My god. I didn't fall off the fucking roof to

644
02:39:52,040 --> 02:39:59,430
begin with. If the horse didn't have to make a gigantic 10 meter circle if he wanted to turn

645
02:39:59,430 --> 02:40:33,590
around. Pain in the ass. I fucking hate these guys. I just want to get on the fucking roof.

646
02:40:33,590 --> 02:40:37,590
I just get me on the roof. I'm just gonna go all the way back to where I was before

647
02:40:37,670 --> 02:40:42,469
and just get up there. Like it's just I'm getting out of this foggy bullshit and I'm

648
02:40:42,469 --> 02:40:53,500
just gonna go from here. Oh my god. Fuck all of you. Look you're a dumb ass little whatever.

649
02:40:53,500 --> 02:41:14,940
I can't get up there. So I'm gonna don't even fucking think about it. Don't even think about it.

650
02:41:31,180 --> 02:41:35,819
Hit him. Get off. Oh no no no. Thank you. I appreciate that you actually helped me. That

651
02:41:35,819 --> 02:41:45,270
actually helped. That would have been very mad. Okay there's a ladder right there. I don't give a

652
02:41:45,270 --> 02:41:49,829
shit about it. Never mind. Fuck the items. Nope. How dare you say fuck the items. Item Andy.

653
02:41:50,629 --> 02:42:12,010
That guy's gonna fuck this whole thing up because he's gonna throw a grenade or whatever.

654
02:42:17,959 --> 02:42:36,649
Oh nice. Worth it. Worth. It's worth it. Worth it. What's this? Oh light a fire.

655
02:42:37,530 --> 02:42:46,250
Seal was broken in town. Ah. So that's how you do it. Okay so there's another one over there.

656
02:42:46,809 --> 02:43:13,909
So I have to destroy the magical seal. I'm so impatient. Fuck it right? Okay. That's hard to

657
02:43:13,909 --> 02:43:54,069
get up through. What's that? Red main painting. Oh shit. All right. Holy shit. What the? I'm gonna

658
02:43:54,069 --> 02:43:57,909
just spawn a hundred times. It's you. Good. Now you get to die and you get to die too.

659
02:43:58,549 --> 02:44:20,260
He's alive? All right. All right. All right. Leave. Leave. Leave. Leave. Leave. Leave.

660
02:44:21,299 --> 02:45:48,059
I can get that. I'm certain of it. Hey. Well we're going that way. He's not enjoying this game at

661
02:45:48,059 --> 02:45:58,950
all. You can tell. No actually I that's completely opposite. He's not enjoying the game at all.

662
02:46:00,090 --> 02:46:04,729
Like he's just he's just desperately trying to fucking hold it together before like freaking out

663
02:46:04,729 --> 02:46:11,899
on stream one day. As you can tell he's just holding it in. He wants to so badly fucking talk

664
02:46:11,899 --> 02:46:18,219
about how he hates this. Hates what he's doing. He hates streaming this game. He fucking hates the

665
02:46:18,219 --> 02:46:27,860
game. It looks like there's a lot of these so I don't know how many of these I'm supposed to be

666
02:46:27,860 --> 02:47:00,389
doing. I have two. Oh I got it. Double slash. Seal's broken up there. There's one more that

667
02:47:00,389 --> 02:47:13,399
I'm gonna go get which is over here and then I'm just gonna go in the front door. Easy snipe. Easy

668
02:47:13,399 --> 02:47:29,159
snipe. Hell yeah. I'm not sure I can get this one from here. Holy shit that's a that's a face.

669
02:47:30,860 --> 02:47:52,280
Holy crap. Um well a little awkward. A little awkward but whatever. I'm just gonna go in the

670
02:47:52,280 --> 02:48:03,049
front door. Holy crap dude. Yeah holy crap. Would you guys rather I say holy crap or like say like

671
02:48:03,770 --> 02:48:17,159
fuck. Which one's like you think more appropriate. I'm just gonna go in the front door. I don't want

672
02:48:17,159 --> 02:48:24,440
to just be like swear guy you know what I mean. I'm gonna start saying like holy shoot. Oh my god.

673
02:48:24,440 --> 02:48:33,479
Oh my goodness. Holy what the oh crap. Um there's a chest just sitting here.

674
02:48:38,409 --> 02:48:47,719
Night comet. Holy crap. That was a genuine holy crap. That one was genuine I can promise you.

675
02:48:49,079 --> 02:49:03,959
That was a genuine holy crap. Holy crap a night comet. All right well let's do this. I got this

676
02:49:03,959 --> 02:49:10,549
one open. I got another one open too. Should I do the one that's lower? This one down uh downtown.

677
02:49:10,549 --> 02:49:17,860
Why am I saying downtown. You know what I mean. I do need a map fragment which is

678
02:49:18,579 --> 02:49:34,010
here. Why is my point pointing that way. Um excuse me. Go up this way now go that way.

679
02:49:37,079 --> 02:49:53,100
What are you talking about. Please do your best Australian action accent. Uh no no I'm not gonna

680
02:49:53,899 --> 02:50:26,200
no no. It's so funny accents like people just get so rage filled if like someone's doing an

681
02:50:26,200 --> 02:50:35,159
accent and they don't sound like their neighbor. You know what I mean. Wait is he doing an Australian

682
02:50:35,159 --> 02:50:42,579
accent. Oh he doesn't sound like my fucking neighbor mate. Get him. But it's just an accent.

683
02:50:42,579 --> 02:51:09,770
It's just an accent. It's just an impression. What the hell. Okay pay attention. I'm getting

684
02:51:09,770 --> 02:51:40,149
double attacked. Don't let him put himself back together. Did you do Jack Sparrow.

685
02:51:42,629 --> 02:52:08,250
I'm done. Oh my career is over. I'm ending my career. It's over today. Listen I have two

686
02:52:08,250 --> 02:52:13,579
headphones in. All right let me explain. The reason why I never have two headphones in is because I

687
02:52:13,579 --> 02:52:20,250
can't hear myself talk. When there are two headphones in I can't hear myself speak and

688
02:52:20,250 --> 02:52:26,010
it kind of speech jams me and messes up pretty much everything. So I don't I don't know how I

689
02:52:26,010 --> 02:52:32,010
sounded right there but I know it sounded. I imagine a walrus with like a big mustache that

690
02:52:32,010 --> 02:52:39,540
goes like this. Like when he's talking. Does that make sense? That's like all I heard and that's all

691
02:52:39,540 --> 02:52:51,430
I saw. That's the only thing I could think of. Okay I can get on top of the building.

692
02:53:12,420 --> 02:53:24,760
No. Yo grace from the last you grace. God he sucks. She's quiet. He sucks. I'm like

693
02:53:24,760 --> 02:53:32,010
I'm trying to jump across the building. No I actually I don't suck. Excuse you.

694
02:53:32,969 --> 02:54:05,049
What the fuck just happened? Okay I can't you can't make that jump. It looks like you can.

695
02:54:05,049 --> 02:54:11,780
It actually looks like you can make the jump. What the fuck I didn't want to go to the statue.

696
02:54:12,340 --> 02:54:27,129
It's probably another way around. I thought it was possible to make the jump if you did it like

697
02:54:27,129 --> 02:54:35,500
perfectly or something. So there's another way to get up there which is probably I actually don't

698
02:54:35,500 --> 02:54:59,639
know. You can't go from here. Maybe you can. Okay whatever. All right let's keep going. So

699
02:55:02,790 --> 02:55:20,020
I need to go where do I go from here? That way? This way up around? All right let's continue our

700
02:55:20,020 --> 02:55:37,540
trek through Elden Ring. Items though hold on. Maybe probably that way but let's just go. He

701
02:55:37,540 --> 02:55:43,139
was dying in such comically avoidable ways. Well but I mean if you're okay but I'm exploring.

702
02:55:43,940 --> 02:55:51,829
I am exploring the game. So of course I'm gonna fall down somewhere if I'm like if I've ever been

703
02:55:51,829 --> 02:55:55,909
there and I'm gonna try to jump up there or something. Like what? I'm a huge Breath of the

704
02:55:55,909 --> 02:56:00,069
Wild fan. One of the cool things about Breath of the Wild was like you could actually go wherever

705
02:56:00,069 --> 02:56:05,270
you wanted. It wasn't like oh you have to go here you have to go there. That's why this game I'm

706
02:56:05,270 --> 02:56:12,520
like comparing it to B-O-T-W. But um you can just kind of explore and that's what I like about this

707
02:56:12,520 --> 02:56:48,059
game. So that's how I'm gonna play it. Okay what? That was very odd. Is it still there?

708
02:56:49,290 --> 02:56:58,420
Why do I feel like it's still up there? Don't you feel like it's still up there and it's gonna

709
02:56:58,420 --> 02:57:38,299
reappear? El Balo. I can't wait till it's actually a boss. If El Balo is really a boss with a health

710
02:57:38,299 --> 02:58:02,870
bar and it plays like that. El Balo. Will you officiate? I'm not officiating any weddings.

711
02:58:03,590 --> 02:58:23,030
Is it? Oh yes. One second. Oh my gosh. One second. I'm looking at something. Oh safe safe safe safe

712
02:58:23,030 --> 02:58:35,059
safe safe safe. There's a person here. Okay hold on. Let me look. Let me see. What have we got? What

713
02:58:35,059 --> 02:58:41,340
have we got? What have we got? What have we got? Hey hey I'm trying to hold on. I'm looking at like

714
02:58:41,340 --> 02:59:06,010
what's I'm looking at food. Stop. No I have to just touch that thing. Okay all right. Oh the oh the

715
02:59:06,010 --> 02:59:10,250
old girlfriend wants to ask what you want for food to get you killed in Elden Ring shtick.

716
02:59:10,889 --> 02:59:19,930
Honey it didn't work. All right hold on. Give me one second. I want to actually look at this.

717
02:59:19,930 --> 02:59:58,090
Yeah okay of course. Of course my usual order. Usual order. Five McChickens. Extra blue cheese.

718
03:00:06,540 --> 03:00:08,790
All right there's somebody here.

719
03:00:30,280 --> 03:00:40,629
He's pretending he has a girlfriend. Hold on guys. I gotta check. I gotta check in with the

720
03:00:40,629 --> 03:00:49,079
girlfriend instead of making it up. Why am I just making that up? That's so fucking. That would be

721
03:00:49,079 --> 03:01:03,399
weird. Okay so this person. Is there like a cure I can give this person? Oh what's this?

722
03:01:04,040 --> 03:01:27,719
Okay well I don't think there's nothing else here. Is the mic audio fucked up today?

723
03:01:27,719 --> 03:01:36,860
It shouldn't be. I don't know. I don't think so. All right that's good. Did I actually get enough

724
03:01:36,860 --> 03:01:48,090
to do this? Four golden seeds. Damn it. Okay so you're infected with scarlet rot. I've actually

725
03:01:48,090 --> 03:02:07,770
made my way to a road which is pretty pog. Oh spells right. Like I got. Oh no no no. I need 68

726
03:02:08,329 --> 03:02:23,620
intelligence to use it. How close am I to actual 52 though? Would I rank Elden Ring? You mean like

727
03:02:23,620 --> 03:02:30,579
on the the. What are we gonna call these now? Right? Before it was like Dark Souls. Souls like

728
03:02:30,579 --> 03:02:38,069
or Souls game. Then Bloodborne came out and it became a Souls born game. Sekiro came out which

729
03:02:38,709 --> 03:02:46,950
wasn't really a kind of Souls kind of game. It was close. But this one is. Are we gonna call these like

730
03:02:47,909 --> 03:02:55,430
Souls brings? Souls Soulsbrings? All right what do I rank this on the Soulsbring

731
03:02:55,430 --> 03:03:07,270
franchises? Soldenbring. Solden. Soldenbringborn. Soldenbrorn. Soldenbringer.

732
03:03:07,270 --> 03:03:24,010
Ringborner. Soldenbring. I don't know. So soft. Souls. Souls. Soul. Soulbringborn. I like. Okay.

733
03:03:24,010 --> 03:03:32,620
Soulbringborn is good. I don't know. Probably like one or two. I want to pass the time because I'm

734
03:03:32,620 --> 03:03:49,299
curious if she dies. Still all right? Well you seem to be fine. Perfectly fine from this morning. So

735
03:03:50,020 --> 03:04:00,649
you need to go to the shack. Oh all right well I don't know where the shack is.

736
03:04:00,649 --> 03:04:13,850
Is it on the map? Find the shack. Oh that's a grave. What's that? Is that a shack?

737
03:04:14,569 --> 03:04:47,350
Don't fucking die please. Oh not fighting you. I think there's an NPC here. South of the town.

738
03:05:00,100 --> 03:05:03,979
You're screaming because you're gonna get hit by that. That's like what I do.

739
03:05:16,860 --> 03:05:42,309
So there's an NPC here. That's not an NPC. Whatever. What do you got? There's something weird over

740
03:05:42,309 --> 03:06:12,889
there though. What's that? Look at this game. This game's Drawstring Poison Grease. That was a fully

741
03:06:12,889 --> 03:06:33,079
charged art too. Feels good when you hit that shit. What is? Oh that's. Oh okay. That's where the

742
03:06:33,079 --> 03:06:39,670
festival was and then we fought down there. Okay I get it. This game's fucking. Never mind. I don't

743
03:06:39,670 --> 03:06:49,209
want to be an idiot. I don't know what's going on here but there's butterflies. Your thinking face

744
03:06:49,209 --> 03:07:00,729
looks dumb. Let's see your thinking face. I don't know why that got me. That got me. That got me.

745
03:07:00,729 --> 03:07:06,739
Like I don't know. I don't know why that got me. That got me angry. I don't understand why but like

746
03:07:06,739 --> 03:07:10,739
it did and it tilted me to a point where I got killed in the middle of that. For those guys dying

747
03:07:10,739 --> 03:07:38,520
one hit. I don't know what's safe and what's not safe to fall. All right let's go. There's a clown

748
03:07:38,520 --> 03:08:01,770
on the top right of your screen. Where? Where? Where? Where? Where? Where do we go? Where do we go?

749
03:08:07,860 --> 03:08:50,979
Big guy. Oh big guy. No problem. Why is nobody spamming that? You guys get over that in one day?

750
03:08:51,620 --> 03:09:04,780
You guys you guys got over that in literally 24 hours. Oh Omega Love. What an old meme that is.

751
03:09:04,780 --> 03:09:22,729
That was yesterday. Something up here. I don't think so. This is bringing me just back to where

752
03:09:22,729 --> 03:09:37,100
all the the dog man farming fighting is. Look okay that looks like a shack.

753
03:09:38,940 --> 03:09:46,520
What else looks like a shack here? This could be a shack. I mean maybe one of these something

754
03:09:46,520 --> 03:09:56,819
over here could look maybe be a shack. Something right here could be a shack. I don't see anything

755
03:09:56,819 --> 03:10:10,540
here that's shack like. This could be it's a it's a shack like over here. Oh my goodness we're fine.

756
03:10:11,020 --> 03:10:16,500
All right so you mean like right here? Like over this way? That looks like shack right there.

757
03:10:17,540 --> 03:10:23,000
I think that's a shack. I think we found the shack. I think we found it.

758
03:10:24,840 --> 03:10:48,659
I did everything. You didn't do anything. I found it. Not we. Me. I did. There are two of you?

759
03:10:49,620 --> 03:11:07,159
That's weird. Oh you're invisible. Oh another goal. I gotta I can definitely level up again.

760
03:11:07,799 --> 03:11:16,950
You know what this reminds me of? This reminds me of um a neverhood. Stuff like that.

761
03:11:17,590 --> 03:11:27,209
Those big bulb almost like clay like trees. Okay so I gotta go up here and apparently the

762
03:11:27,209 --> 03:11:46,549
shack is right there. I mean this looks like a shack. It might not be. Okay that that I thought

763
03:11:46,549 --> 03:12:10,280
I looked like it could be an NPC. Who's not an NPC? I have no mana. We don't need it. Swamp

764
03:12:10,280 --> 03:12:26,840
lookout tower. Eternal darkness. Oh that's right I did get the I got the uh the knight comment

765
03:12:28,379 --> 03:12:41,860
and uh okay cool. What does eternal darkness do? Can I do anything else with this? Maybe I can. Hold

766
03:12:41,860 --> 03:12:52,090
on. This might be kind of a weird thing to try but whatever. Like it looks like I can get in there.

767
03:12:54,969 --> 03:13:04,739
Yeah look see on the tree. Can I climb the tree and jump from the top or does it just look cool?

768
03:13:10,860 --> 03:13:26,940
All right that's not the shack. It's a cool tower. This I guess this is a good vantage point.

769
03:13:30,780 --> 03:13:46,100
That a shack right there. That could look it'll be like a shack.

770
03:13:50,469 --> 03:14:34,620
Just south of town it's in the canyon. But like here? Shack? Shack probably down here.

771
03:14:34,620 --> 03:14:57,209
All right shack. Back. Stop by the shack. Is it even on the map? It's not. I mean it kind of is.

772
03:14:57,209 --> 03:15:02,180
Sort of blends in. Wait how am I supposed to stop by the shack? You have a big dog.

773
03:15:02,739 --> 03:15:43,079
Okay back time. What do you got? What's here? A pleasure to see you. A pleasure indeed.

774
03:15:43,799 --> 03:15:53,620
I am Gary a great sage in my day anyway. I'd hoped to ask a favor when one of your ilk came along.

775
03:15:53,620 --> 03:16:00,120
A strapping young tarnished able to cross the scarlet swamp of Aeonia. Don't fret.

776
03:16:00,760 --> 03:16:12,729
Should you accept? We'll teach you the secret of Selya, the town you see there. Secret? What do you got?

777
03:16:12,729 --> 03:16:18,790
Then you are willing to lend a hand are you? I need your help to heal a certain young girl.

778
03:16:18,790 --> 03:16:21,670
I know where she is. Her name is Millicent.

779
03:16:22,309 --> 03:16:28,250
The life I sent? No way. Resting at the church atop the cliff.

780
03:16:29,219 --> 03:16:38,489
Stricken by the rotting sickness. Okay what about her? Rotting sickness that afflicts Millicent

781
03:16:38,489 --> 03:16:45,700
has no cure. When the earth tree flourished even the demigods could not stave off its effects

782
03:16:45,700 --> 03:16:53,030
despite their nigh godhood. Millicent's suffering can be eliminated. I have these like pink boogers.

783
03:16:53,110 --> 03:17:01,670
You are to find a certain needle. Seek the deep scarlet swamp of Aeonia outside Selya's hands.

784
03:17:01,670 --> 03:17:06,629
The needle made from unalloyed gold is lost somewhere. Don't I have it?

785
03:17:07,510 --> 03:17:29,620
I actually think I have it. Bro I already own it. Here it is. Gold needle. First you must find

786
03:17:29,620 --> 03:17:36,860
the unalloyed. It's hidden somewhere in the deep scarlet swamp. Then I will tell you as the secret

787
03:17:37,739 --> 03:17:48,680
okay that's not the right one so it's in the deep swamp swamp of somewhere deep in the swampy area

788
03:17:49,719 --> 03:18:10,860
okay cool let's keep going um i think i want to just pour it back here just go up add that to

789
03:18:10,860 --> 03:18:35,639

797
03:20:19,209 --> 03:20:31,430
but this road there's no more road here oh there's a jumpy all right going this way

800
03:21:05,350 --> 03:21:12,010
the game really wants me to do like a funny little go down here thing look at these platforms

801
03:21:12,569 --> 03:21:18,440
or is it just one platform and my brain is stupid i think that's what it is no

802
03:21:20,329 --> 03:21:42,149
why is this here you see i mean like what's the point of these i didn't gatekeeper for those

803
03:21:42,149 --> 03:21:57,079
returning to the roots what i just do gamer statue what did these do what is that showing

818
03:26:37,000 --> 03:27:11,780
at the same time and the omega dragon that's not happening don't fight me it's neat all right map

819
03:27:11,780 --> 03:27:22,540
fragment and maybe a bonfire this is dragon barrel this is this is dragon barrel this is where the

820
03:27:22,540 --> 03:27:46,219
other half of the um medallion is all right i need a bonfire now i don't see one i'm gonna head this

821
03:27:46,219 --> 03:28:07,579
way touch grass there we go all right you can also level up probably once or twice perfect so

822
03:28:07,579 --> 03:28:12,700
where dragon barrow far to the east for the other half of that resident evil coin thing

823
03:28:13,420 --> 03:28:21,579
well it was called it was a fort it's like oh seek fort something right

824
03:28:25,899 --> 03:28:32,040
fort fort fort for roth fort far off yeah all right that's where we're going i'm gonna find

825
03:28:32,040 --> 03:28:51,500
that fortune i think i can level up twice because this might be 10 000 we'll find out

826
03:28:51,500 --> 03:29:30,069
okay i might be a little short yeah i'm a little short okay although let me okay that's definitely

827
03:29:30,069 --> 03:29:39,290
not a fort this could be that could be okay let me clear the all the shit i have out

828
03:29:41,930 --> 03:29:52,979
this could be a fort this i don't think that's a fort this looks like it that's probably it right

829
03:29:52,979 --> 03:29:59,299
there i'm gonna guess it's one of those two i'm also gonna mark this because i want to go to it

830
03:30:01,459 --> 03:30:04,979
yeah it's definitely two there's no way it's not two but i'm closer to four

831
03:30:05,700 --> 03:30:14,170
let's just mark all this stuff because i'm gonna be experimenting four is closer so that's where

832
03:30:14,170 --> 03:30:36,020
i'm gonna go just to see what it is be careful there are dogs among us like a little chat wait

833
03:30:36,659 --> 03:30:41,620
why is it why are you fighting me what well i didn't do why are they attacking me why are

834
03:30:41,620 --> 03:30:54,100
the goats attacking get away from me i don't i don't want to kill these goats no animal in

835
03:30:54,100 --> 03:31:11,819
the whole game is attacked besides these guys there's another bonfire oh merchant merchant

836
03:31:11,819 --> 03:31:31,500
shack maybe i'll buy something since i've seen a customer now dragon wound grease gravel stone

837
03:31:32,059 --> 03:31:51,450
jewel pot spiked cestus oh note gateway note imparting knowledge in brief didn't cave

838
03:31:52,170 --> 03:32:00,200
let's get these i'm gonna read them right now

839
03:32:06,729 --> 03:32:23,540
all right i'm gonna mark this and i'm gonna read those notes where they listed here right okay

840
03:32:23,540 --> 03:32:36,229
note gateway port gale in caitlin houses a gateway that leads to red main castle okay there is a

841
03:32:36,229 --> 03:32:45,319
hidden cave in the town of celia look beyond the graveyard at the precipice okay this painter is

842
03:32:45,319 --> 03:32:49,719
said to have captured the landscape seen during the last moments of those welcomed into death's

843
03:32:49,719 --> 03:32:55,239
embrace so the painter and the messages of the dead's last moments can be discovered by visiting

844
03:32:55,239 --> 03:33:05,590
the location depicted even now these are cool because you have to go find this spot and find

845
03:33:05,590 --> 03:33:15,500
this exact place find that exact view and it's probably like look down and hit a i think that's

846
03:33:15,500 --> 03:33:32,739
close that seems close i'll look at it later didn't breath of the wild do this yeah i know b o t w b o

847
03:33:32,739 --> 03:33:47,129
t w is one of the best games all right so that's that let's go uh i'm gonna go probably not add

848
03:33:47,129 --> 03:34:00,139
let's go whatever this is lazy but i don't care any chapstick thank you for reminding me appreciate

849
03:34:00,139 --> 03:34:22,280
that ow all right so now i'm gonna go this way we're just knocking out all the markers just

850
03:34:22,280 --> 03:34:49,350
because i feel like it that's what we're doing that's what we're going really you got a lot of

851
03:34:49,350 --> 03:35:36,739
health so what's this thing all right be careful oh he's so scary all the way up divine tower

852
03:35:36,739 --> 03:35:43,459
there's epic loot tations in there and it activates a great room that's cool what you're saying is

853
03:35:43,459 --> 03:35:55,270
let's go get up there why does this seem like the bird like the worst and best okay you're supposed

854
03:35:56,069 --> 03:36:22,540
only shit i oh okay i just like dark souls i pressed the spring button geez this is so

855
03:36:22,540 --> 03:36:47,030
fucking stressful okay it's gonna get in the way so get rid of it birthday what the 4000th birthday

856
03:36:52,149 --> 03:37:08,889
where's lanya i've been looking for them the whole game right that is a one of these

857
03:37:09,610 --> 03:37:12,969
is divine tower of caitlin

858
03:37:15,690 --> 03:37:46,260
very very very very nice what's in the tower is the question oh let's do this door here oops

859
03:37:59,670 --> 03:38:17,420
yeah this is going on yeah that's a that activates the great room that's intriguing

860
03:38:17,420 --> 03:38:44,819
that's intriguing that's intriguing that's intriguing see it you see it i can jump halfway

861
03:38:44,819 --> 03:38:53,430
into the thing how much longer till you finish the game a very very very long way

862
03:38:54,469 --> 03:39:12,340
an exceptionally long way store the power of great dan's great ruin what does that one do

863
03:39:18,979 --> 03:39:35,670
raises maximum hp fp and stamina um okay so this one is okay godric's gives you plus five to all

864
03:39:35,670 --> 03:39:47,000
stats for dan's gives you increased hp fp and stamina but his five vitality better than the

865
03:39:47,000 --> 03:39:54,790
max hp you get from this you know what i mean i feel like you get more from this unless this is

866
03:39:54,790 --> 03:40:06,889
a lot because this is effectively bigger uh mind and endurance whereas this is all of them i wonder

867
03:40:06,889 --> 03:40:14,149
how wonder how much it actually is to me that would have to be very significant to not use

868
03:40:14,149 --> 03:40:31,579
the other one that's cool all right so the fort is definitely right there very cool hp is probably

869
03:40:31,579 --> 03:40:41,000
higher dan is only good once you've hit the soft cap of stats oh that makes sense if you get to

870
03:40:41,000 --> 03:40:49,590
40 vitality right 40 vigor that makes sense that would be better than not that useful maybe now

871
03:40:50,229 --> 03:40:57,989
what about the rest of the tower oh there was another way to go you're right i even like

872
03:40:57,989 --> 03:41:07,579
freaked out about it um let me do this part i mean i'm gonna do this first this has got me this has

873
03:41:07,579 --> 03:41:14,040
got me hooked this part here there's also the huge dragon here too all right i'm gonna go kill the

874
03:41:14,040 --> 03:41:26,010
huge dragon i'm gonna go stab the dragon in the face i wonder how much damage it does is this like

875
03:41:26,010 --> 03:41:34,250
just gary am i gonna die here he he summons a shit load of dragons i'm just gonna die

876
03:41:35,209 --> 03:42:01,100
so you sneak up in the face jump on top i don't know what to do um can i actually climb on top

877
03:42:02,440 --> 03:42:40,020
oh that was that was another dragon why they just let me i'm stuck here i think i got the strat

878
03:42:40,739 --> 03:43:36,920
get away from me oh this is 13 000 damage how believe so i mean i had a kind of a cheese

879
03:43:36,920 --> 03:43:46,409
ball scrap right there but i wonder if it's maybe i should try how big is he

880
03:44:12,549 --> 03:44:19,459
all right maybe i should go along his body he'd probably i guarantee it they probably got like a

881
03:44:19,459 --> 03:44:34,090
big bulbous pimple on their back and i can just whack right it's probably a huge pimple let's go

882
03:44:34,250 --> 03:45:01,850
find out why is he just why is he all head and neck he's just a huge neck with wings

883
03:45:04,200 --> 03:45:39,959
where is his body i'm gonna go further up the mountain he's all head and neck his legs are

884
03:45:39,959 --> 03:45:56,629
gonna be this big and he's gonna have like tiny little feet okay okay there's his head

885
03:45:57,510 --> 03:46:11,819
he's lying down theoretically his tail should be this way where are my souls i need my souls

886
03:46:12,700 --> 03:46:46,340
you're just sitting on top of them that's so dumb whatever okay i kind of feel i don't like

890
03:48:02,120 --> 03:48:10,100
i not be doing this for like storyline reasons is there actually a reason why i shouldn't be

891
03:48:10,100 --> 03:48:53,579
doing this it's a story npc 14 000 damage on a bleed we're getting tired my guy's like all right

892
03:48:54,540 --> 03:49:01,690

896
03:50:27,239 --> 03:50:32,200
it would just smell like just rotting eggs this thing was lying down for probably like a century

897
03:50:32,920 --> 03:50:41,000
this would kill you like the the power of the smell right here would kill you all right turn

there's an item right there it's so clean lick the floor then all right back in that rafter area

929
04:02:00,440 --> 04:02:22,680
down here oh fuck okay let me get hold on wait wait wait i fucking fell down this guy's respawning

930
04:02:25,850 --> 04:02:28,569
why are they respawning they shouldn't be this is not how this game works

931
04:02:32,309 --> 04:02:44,360
eat spaghetti off the floor even if it was a clean carpet imagine eating spaghetti off a carpet

932
04:02:45,319 --> 04:03:02,250
i was just like you know what i'm gonna try to jump to that because there might be something

933
04:03:02,250 --> 04:03:05,610
there like an item on the edge and it looked like i really could get to it and i didn't think it

934
04:03:05,610 --> 04:03:27,239
was gonna go that far down it's right here whatever hey there's a gold item in there

935
04:03:43,219 --> 04:04:09,799
that's the one oh nice very nice the other one right okay so how do i drop down from there

936
04:04:09,799 --> 04:04:40,500
there that was tough right over there it's over there oh shit i know don't make this joke anymore

937
04:04:50,760 --> 04:05:07,159
all right so it's underneath me right now so i can just jump from here to there

938
04:05:07,799 --> 04:05:25,059
i'm gonna get hit by bat in there no i need my starlight a lot of fucking health don't you

939
04:05:33,379 --> 04:05:56,299
oh fuck all right so that was crazy i'm glad i had the light but what's this

940
04:05:56,379 --> 04:06:12,620
this adagon's sore seal oh greatly increases attributes but also increases damage taken

941
04:06:13,500 --> 04:06:22,069
that's a lot that's plus five to how come not intelligence oh because i'm looking at the

942
04:06:22,069 --> 04:06:36,500
intelligence one right no int it's plus five to everything but not plus five to intelligence why

943
04:06:36,500 --> 04:06:55,180
not no or mind i wonder what increases damage taken this legendary talisman is an eye engraved

944
04:06:55,180 --> 04:07:02,379
with an elden rune said to be the seal of king consort radagon greatly raises vigor endurance

945
04:07:02,379 --> 04:07:08,200
strength and dexterity but also increases damage taken by a similar measure solemn duty weighs upon

946
04:07:08,200 --> 04:07:15,899
the one who beholden not unlike a gnawing curse i wonder what the damage increases because it's

947
04:07:15,899 --> 04:07:21,510
a separate one for magic no i guess that makes sense but that was cool all right i cleaned up

948
04:07:21,510 --> 04:07:27,940
this area a little bit there's a couple things i probably still do where is this pointing me down

949
04:07:27,940 --> 04:07:51,819
here so i wonder celia deep swamp aeonia or do i try to activate that lift so the world ends here

950
04:07:52,459 --> 04:08:07,959
so there's no more way to go up this way it's probably a place to go here this is a really

951
04:08:07,959 --> 04:08:22,389
weird map look at how weird this map is so there's an area here and an area here nothing in the middle

952
04:08:22,389 --> 04:08:34,780
nothing it's like a big giant like circle it looks like this land right here here right though it's a

953
04:08:34,780 --> 04:08:44,219
big giant circle it's a ring it's a giant elden ring the the ring is the land it's not a material

954
04:08:44,219 --> 04:08:51,100
thing it's the elden ring is the the world is really old it's the ring the world is the elden

955
04:08:51,100 --> 04:09:19,450
ring all right uh like somebody say go back in the tower we did it we beat the game i do want to

956
04:09:19,450 --> 04:09:38,059
level up one more time though almost there right 39 000 i need a couple how much does this give

957
04:09:38,059 --> 04:09:53,780
thousand can't go wrong with vitality i just can't i'm gonna take soap off the bar because

958
04:09:53,780 --> 04:10:01,299
it's kind of fucking me up and this thing is also fucking me up too okay so there's more in here

959
04:10:01,299 --> 04:10:13,399
somebody said they were like dude go check i was like all right because there's another ladder

960
04:10:13,399 --> 04:10:53,139
that way let's i'm just gonna go down there who cares because i can't it's gonna be tricky but

961
04:10:53,139 --> 04:11:25,340
i'll try newman's ruin newman used to gain a multitude of ruins the newman are said to have

962
04:11:25,340 --> 04:11:34,069
come from outside the lands between in fact of the same stock as queen marika 10 000 20 000

963
04:11:34,950 --> 04:11:59,930
yeah how much is a multitude i wonder probably 20k or 10 all right well let's go down here what

964
04:11:59,930 --> 04:12:15,340
what huh i can't walk across that but i could walk across it it looked like a lip i could cross

965
04:12:15,340 --> 04:12:49,479
hold on i don't buy it i don't actually don't buy it i don't buy it okay what would why would

966
04:12:49,479 --> 04:12:56,489
this ladder be here if you can't cross that there's no this ladder makes no sense unless

967
04:12:56,489 --> 04:13:35,159
you keep continuing this way yeah what what did i do wrong now what now what what the hell

968
04:13:35,159 --> 04:13:55,500
trick disappointing what's the hell what why is this ladder here that ladder doesn't even need

969
04:13:55,500 --> 04:14:13,479
to be here there's nothing i can do here i drop down i'm gonna just i don't know i don't know i

970
04:14:13,479 --> 04:14:45,420
think i'm dead if i drop the gap on the other side okay well i went that way last time right

971
04:14:45,420 --> 04:14:57,270
let's go this way probably in inside the tower is it a room down here that i didn't that i ran

972
04:14:57,270 --> 04:15:19,030
through or something i ran by okay it is right here i don't go off the fucking edge

973
04:15:20,790 --> 04:15:32,940
oh fucking how much can you help you both to be copying each other's moves you're not original

974
04:15:33,739 --> 04:15:59,479
oh so what is this oh shit i can jump around this but wait investigate does not open from this side

975
04:15:59,479 --> 04:16:59,399
of course it doesn't from here this is such a far way down oh my god okay um now what a golden

976
04:16:59,399 --> 04:17:12,500
rune i don't have to jump on that right i actually have to land on that thing i've got a jump onto

977
04:17:12,500 --> 04:17:25,059
that little thing oh that was way off that was way off oh there's a bonfire down here

978
04:17:26,020 --> 04:17:32,100
it's a bonfire okay at least i know i know there's a bonfire where there's a bonfire

979
04:17:32,100 --> 04:17:39,159
that is so far by the way do you see how far that is it's gonna take me an hour it's gonna

980
04:17:39,159 --> 04:17:49,750
take an hour to get down there what the hell i free fell i sky dove down this whole thing

981
04:17:52,840 --> 04:18:03,850
that was very far they don't fall with me do they yes they do well then they're not gonna make it

982
04:18:03,850 --> 04:18:19,379
oh my god what do i this way i panicked because he was following me and i forgot which way it was

983
04:18:19,379 --> 04:18:25,940
here comes the big yeah this is that dumb tree area in dark souls one when we just fall down

984
04:18:25,940 --> 04:18:41,540
the whole what's it called the route and like it was still only 2k rooms it's fine patience

985
04:19:11,430 --> 04:19:46,780
it weren't even close oh don't move fuck maybe just a single roll just one singular roll

986
04:19:47,500 --> 04:20:12,629
just and that's it just a single a single roll what about walk i'm gonna go for the one just

987
04:20:12,629 --> 04:20:58,569

and then on the ledge it's on the ledge i'm gonna speedrun this i'm gonna get there now

995
04:23:32,809 --> 04:24:44,409
i forgot to kill that guy oh don't he's too stupid to walk over here he died somebody fell off

996
04:24:44,409 --> 04:25:28,809
there's a lot of items you're not gonna put an item over here from software yes you are why

997
04:25:28,809 --> 04:25:34,540
wouldn't there be one in the corner right there right there it should be why don't even let me

998
04:25:34,540 --> 04:25:39,819
go over here unless you're gonna put what a waste of wasting my time absolutely wasting my time

999
04:25:40,540 --> 04:25:48,540
dude where are you getting what are you getting this half-price ganja you smoke half-price ganja

1005
04:28:40,860 --> 04:29:44,600
it doesn't make any sense i want to go up the ladder though i want to go up the ladder i don't

1006
04:29:44,600 --> 04:30:03,260
think i can get that from here i think i'm stuck down here i don't get to swing that many times

1007

1012
04:37:04,500 --> 04:37:30,340
trousers and fox that was crazy wood made by sewing together patches of smooth skin oh

1013
04:37:32,169 --> 04:37:54,389
ew overreaction for the youtube video yucky it's skin no bonuses to anything that's a lot

1014
04:37:54,389 --> 04:38:07,459
of magic resistance though it's actually just skin hair look at that poise that poise is awful

1015
04:38:08,099 --> 04:38:44,150
let's see what it looks like no gloves where are they oh my god i don't want to look at that

1016
04:38:44,150 --> 04:38:58,569
this is horrible oh it's so awful like it just looks i hate every second of that

1017
04:38:59,130 --> 04:39:20,340
let me back my fucking dunce comedy outfit wait maybe i'll keep the oh actually that actually

1018
04:39:20,340 --> 04:39:29,849
matches the helmet okay i like the pants they match the head i got a hundred thousand souls

1019
04:39:29,849 --> 04:39:37,689
and i gotta be careful here human skin versus comedy outfit there's a chest in here too

1020
04:39:38,409 --> 04:39:53,770
is this a joke chest why would there be a chest here don't put that in here god slayers great

1021
04:39:53,770 --> 04:40:09,049
sword what sacred sword of the dusk-eyed queen who controlled the godskin apostles

1022
04:40:09,049 --> 04:40:16,650
before her defeat at the hands of maleketh black flames wielded by the apostles are channeled

1023
04:40:16,650 --> 04:40:23,700
from this sword unique skill the queen's black flame set the set the blade ablaze with the

1024
04:40:23,700 --> 04:40:28,740
god-slaying black flame before delivering a sweeping slash additional input allows for a

1025
04:40:28,740 --> 04:40:38,250
follow-up attack black flames will continue to wear down hp for a while what this thing

1026
04:40:38,250 --> 04:40:49,209
is insane looking look at this thing wow that's probably the coolest weapon in the game like in

1027
04:40:49,209 --> 04:41:07,209
regards to how it looks i don't have mana to do it that's so cool looking i can't i don't have

1028
04:41:07,209 --> 04:41:15,110
any mana to do the thing but it still looks awesome this is one of the best weapons in the game you

1029
04:41:15,110 --> 04:41:21,419
should use the flame i imagine it's pretty similar to what these guys are doing to me up here

1030
04:41:26,340 --> 04:41:31,849
okay but that's not that only thing that's down i i like ran away i'll check that out in a minute

1031
04:41:31,849 --> 04:41:38,500
look at how many cool weapons are in this game you know i will say elden ring versus all the other

1032
04:41:38,500 --> 04:41:46,419
souls games there's a lot less at least maybe my brain is remembering this wrong i feel like

1033
04:41:46,419 --> 04:41:56,419
there's a lot of really cool items it's not just like short sword long sword a zweander claymore

1034
04:41:56,419 --> 04:42:05,689
right i feel like there's a ton of these unique weapons a lot more ninety percent of them are

1035
04:42:05,689 --> 04:42:10,889
suck though yeah but i don't think that matters i think it's fun to take decide on a playthrough

1036
04:42:10,889 --> 04:42:20,599
where you're gonna use you know what like i'm i'm using the raduvia in this playthrough i think

1037
04:42:20,599 --> 04:42:29,029
about that's very like actually interesting like the dismounter i'm gonna use this all right so

1038
04:42:29,029 --> 04:42:34,970
that was cool actually i don't i don't want to lose these souls so i gotta be really careful here

1039
04:42:35,930 --> 04:43:04,229
uh we're not gonna do this i can now put the staff on oh i need one more shit i got this thing too

1040
04:43:04,950 --> 04:43:11,860
i gotta go back to the town i got a lot of shit to look through hold on all right all right all

1041
04:43:11,860 --> 04:43:17,509
right all right here's what we're gonna do i'm going back to town i gotta go find it because

1042
04:43:17,509 --> 04:43:35,880
that's a boss soul weapon that is a boss soul weapon the cool int weapon or it's just another

1043
04:43:35,880 --> 04:43:56,729
level which i'll take either one all right what's what is this bastard stars what is this thing

1044
04:43:58,150 --> 04:44:14,409
what is this thing it's a flail it's a magic flail what oh my goodness it's a solar system flail

1045
04:44:14,409 --> 04:44:49,450
ash of war waves of darkness the big d and c scaling it's a flail it's dex int youtube reaction

1046
04:44:49,450 --> 04:44:57,340
for the youtube video look it needs 22 decks as well like this is this is this is an annoying

1047
04:44:57,340 --> 04:45:03,909
weird weapon to get right because you have to put like 10 to 50 you gotta put like at least 10 points

1048
04:45:03,909 --> 04:45:12,299
in decks to have this item and nobody's gonna do that like that's i don't i mean at least not

1049
04:45:12,299 --> 04:45:39,130
too late late game probably right it's expensive and i got it i just want to look at it what the

1050
04:45:39,209 --> 04:45:54,200
hell it's so weird it's actually a solar system i want to see what the i want to see what the power

1051
04:45:54,200 --> 04:46:03,369
does we're just gonna go to like land grave or something it's a baby rattle

1052
04:46:07,979 --> 04:46:13,740
it's a baby rattle all right i need to take the helmet off take the shirt off put a diaper on

1053
04:46:13,740 --> 04:46:17,900
okay does anything look like a diaper in the game because i will use the baby i will be baby character

1054
04:46:18,459 --> 04:46:56,169
okay let's see let's test it out on some sheep that does a lot of damage just like

1055
04:46:56,729 --> 04:47:08,630
in general it's not even leveled up that was 256 damage from the swing and it has not even

1056
04:47:08,630 --> 04:47:21,479
zero plus zero but it's but i have so many cool fucking weapons though that's the problem

1057
04:47:24,540 --> 04:47:47,189
does it have an l2 combo to try and try again l2 l2 i mean you're very vulnerable right here

1058
04:47:47,189 --> 04:48:00,680
because it's like one two three four it's about four full seconds all right it's decision time

1059
04:48:00,680 --> 04:48:05,400
this is a big decision i want all of you this is gonna we're gonna do this democratically

1060
04:48:06,360 --> 04:48:16,729
we're gonna do this we're gonna do this democratically now it's gonna work

1061
04:48:17,450 --> 04:48:41,619
where's the where is it okay are you guys ready we're gonna devote this one out of four items here

1062
04:48:44,020 --> 04:49:02,869
l2 r2 all right baby flail ab flail i want you to get a good look at it i'm gonna see

1063
04:49:05,909 --> 04:49:11,430
no okay people are gonna vote for this because of that people everyone's gonna click on this

1064
04:49:11,430 --> 04:49:15,189
because of what they're looking on the screen right now i need to put a pair of pants on so

1065
04:49:15,189 --> 04:49:21,770
people don't fucking automatically pick this because okay that made it worse that made it

1066
04:49:21,770 --> 04:49:27,529
way worse that made it way worse something that doesn't look like a fucking baby diaper okay

1067
04:49:30,680 --> 04:49:37,159
okay here we go baby rattle cool animation it's got the big explosion thing

1068
04:49:37,959 --> 04:49:46,380
it's pretty cool it's pretty sick pretty cool weapon i let's take a look at that again

1069
04:49:47,340 --> 04:49:58,439
without bang boom pretty cool we also have bug arm bug leaf so this thing is is like a scimitar

1070
04:49:58,439 --> 04:50:06,569
got a pretty good swing also has does not take intelligence to do this it has a big

1071
04:50:07,209 --> 04:50:16,939
intelligence scaling magic weapon also it's got its own version of the baby rattle although this

1072
04:50:16,939 --> 04:50:22,470
one is better i that happens faster it might not do as much damage we're not sure

1073
04:50:24,650 --> 04:50:40,090
bug wing that does not take intelligence pretty sick we also have moon veil now if you don't know

1074
04:50:40,090 --> 04:50:44,250
what moon veil is moon veil is the thing that has been uh carrying us through the entire mid game

1075
04:50:45,720 --> 04:50:52,500
i'll go we'll call this styrofoam sword if you want to get a good look it's styrofoam so styrofoam

1076
04:50:52,500 --> 04:51:00,740
sword boom take a look at this wham those thousand damage whoosh big intelligence move

1077
04:51:00,740 --> 04:51:06,099
unbelievably beautiful everyone's not going to vote for this because the katana and all katanas

1078
04:51:06,099 --> 04:51:13,139
are shitty loser weapons in these games from what i've been told so but it's incredible finally

1079
04:51:14,340 --> 04:51:17,209
we've got this

1080
04:51:23,689 --> 04:51:33,509
finally we've got the moonlit greatsword staple in from software and a weapon that is

1081
04:51:33,509 --> 04:51:39,849
in every single one of these games it can turn into a big bright night light which then has this

1082
04:51:39,849 --> 04:51:45,290
awesome beauty it's frost damage shoots out these cool projectiles also does not take

1083
04:51:45,290 --> 04:52:07,290
mana to do that very cool so what do we have ab rattle uh styrofoam katana bug wing moonlit

1084
04:52:07,290 --> 04:52:23,740
sword oh you want to see the other one yeah let me show you that one too somebody fucking weapons

1085
04:52:24,380 --> 04:52:31,750
there's so many weapons where is it right all right what is current i can't even look yet

1086
04:52:32,549 --> 04:52:47,299
i don't think i have enough ability to i can't turn it on the game won't let me turn the

1087
04:52:47,299 --> 04:52:59,659
cool thing on all right is it baby rattle or bug wing okay baby rattle is currently winning

1088
04:52:59,659 --> 04:53:09,180
bug wing is really close i can't even activate the power because i'm not

1089
04:53:09,180 --> 04:53:21,580
cool enough unfortunately you're gonna have to do a redo all right baby rattle one i'm thinking

1090
04:53:22,220 --> 04:53:50,869
this weapon better be fucking good the baby i don't think i actually i don't know if i want

1091
04:53:50,869 --> 04:53:59,020
to play as the baby should i not play as baby okay we're gonna do a vote between baby rattle

1092
04:53:59,020 --> 04:54:04,759
and bug wing because those are the two that ones and now everybody gets a choice baby rattle and

1093
04:54:04,759 --> 04:54:15,819
bug wing are now you get the real choice of real choices here pretty damn cool but what about this

1094
04:54:15,819 --> 04:54:26,470
one have you seen this one have you taken a look at what this one can do it's sick really cool

1101
04:56:52,380 --> 04:56:57,099

1102
04:56:57,099 --> 04:57:16,650
in the game so how do i not have a regular somber smithing stone doesn't seem impossible

1103

1120
05:02:37,110 --> 05:02:45,029

1121
05:02:45,669 --> 05:02:54,759
decent encounter it shouldn't be too hard the bug is way cooler it's too bad chat voted

1122
05:02:55,319 --> 05:03:00,979
thing is there's enough materials i could use in both let's kill but i'm gonna lean into this

1123
05:03:00,979 --> 05:03:44,119
for just a few moments let's go it's going way better it still hurts stop rolling

1128
05:06:59,590 --> 05:07:11,720
defense is okay actually i'm not against it it's like baby birth it's like birthday boy

1129
05:07:12,439 --> 05:07:29,560

1131
05:07:59,029 --> 05:08:14,439

1132
05:08:15,400 --> 05:08:25,639
but hold on what does that actually look like i feel like there's less when i have this on

1133
05:08:34,150 --> 05:08:43,700
is it like is it is it like he's an ass no i'm not ass inspecting i'm not i'm just i that was

1134
05:08:43,700 --> 05:09:24,409
weird to see okay i'm going back to the blacksmith where the fuck am i where is he i thought he was

1135
05:09:24,409 --> 05:09:43,849
a rock i don't think i have enough to level up doing all right this actually i'm not even

1136
05:09:43,849 --> 05:09:51,770
kidding around is probably gonna end up doing a ton of damage i need another thousand souls

1137
05:09:52,330 --> 05:10:22,180
we're gonna get a thousand so we're gonna get like 5 000 souls quick like very quick dogs down here

1138
05:10:22,180 --> 05:10:31,400
i guess i could just go but no they're only giving like 200 they sell some weapons and armor people

1139
05:10:31,400 --> 05:10:35,639
got mad at me when i did that last time i'm just gonna go to where i kind of like this area here

1140
05:10:35,639 --> 05:10:44,840
there's a bunch of random shit i can kill so did i is that it for caleb i don't think i did this

1141
05:10:45,560 --> 05:11:03,770
yeah let me let me investigate some of this stuff here because there was this thing here where is

1142
05:11:03,770 --> 05:11:11,990
this because this is like along this road all right i'm gonna go here i'll go do that dungeon

1143
05:11:12,549 --> 05:11:22,060
this is not upgraded all the way and this is not final but i'm curious how much damage this does

1144
05:11:22,060 --> 05:11:37,240
at like a plus four or plus five i mean for having a bunch of enemies you get surrounded by enemies

1145
05:11:37,240 --> 05:12:02,810
that's like a absolute oh shit button let's try it to be interrupted it's doing a decent amount

1146
05:12:03,689 --> 05:12:26,819
once it's leveled up it'll be better staggers it's really pretty it sucks stop it does

1147
05:12:28,729 --> 05:12:31,770
i wasted no i didn't i'm gonna i'm gonna wait until i level up a little more

1148
05:12:32,650 --> 05:13:03,349
it's not even leveled up wait till it's leveled up another super time look at that it staggers big

1149
05:13:03,349 --> 05:13:48,409
time the baby sucks it's not fair to it's not fair to talk about it yet i have no i'm not giving up

1150
05:13:48,409 --> 05:13:59,959
on it yet it seems like it's but it's this we're going up this is not leveled for the enemies i'm

1151
05:13:59,959 --> 05:14:14,069
fighting that's stupid i don't care instant kill moves are dumb instant kill moves are dumb

1152
05:14:17,020 --> 05:14:47,939
let me say it again instant kill moves are stupid all right you're not fully armored i know ratio

1153
05:14:47,939 --> 05:15:16,169
don't ratio me actually is getting a lot better 157 plus 148 it's starting to get actually pretty

1154
05:15:16,169 --> 05:15:45,909
good what's the katana right now katana is plus eight it's 187 plus 148 one seven plus one 168

1155
05:15:45,909 --> 05:16:05,560
plus 166 katana is so much better by by like an insane order of magnitude you want to try it with

1156
05:16:05,560 --> 05:16:15,380
the boss and give up after 30 minutes and rant about how much it sucks for 30 minutes yeah no

1157
05:16:15,939 --> 05:16:20,740
what the hell did you hear my voice yeah what was that fucking weird thing that i just did

1158
05:16:36,299 --> 05:17:05,400
all right let me take a look 157 plus 148 187 plus 148 is plus seven this is plus eight

1159
05:17:17,270 --> 05:17:23,590
i'll try it for a while i do need uh some more souls to get it to the same place

1160
05:17:25,189 --> 05:17:33,060
okay so i i how many plus nine smithing stones do i have i only have one plus nine smithing stone

1161
05:17:33,060 --> 05:17:44,200
right now and i am absolutely not going to use it on the baby rattle and until stars have

1162
05:17:44,200 --> 05:18:00,139
higher int scaling all right because i can get this i am willing to get this to plus eight

1163
05:18:00,939 --> 05:18:07,740
and try it but i need i need some more souls i'm gonna sell a couple of things that's

1164
05:18:07,740 --> 05:18:18,409

1166
05:18:48,009 --> 05:18:48,970
hey what about blade

1167
05:18:52,090 --> 05:18:53,049

1168
05:18:53,049 --> 05:19:04,169
with a fallen star struck and make it yours what the precious treasure so that lady may tread

1169
05:19:04,169 --> 05:19:19,430
i already did that man i need 1575 so let me just go get like a thousand souls like in two seconds

1170
05:19:22,840 --> 05:19:37,580
if you kill one boss with a baby weapon then it deserves a plus nine why did i come here this is

1171
05:19:37,580 --> 05:20:19,669
my least favorite area in the whole game i've been able to swing why did i come here this place sucks

1172
05:20:20,150 --> 05:20:36,950
why would i why did i come to this area no it's not the weapon the baby rattle is it's gonna be

1173
05:20:36,950 --> 05:20:53,060
sick trust me it's gonna work out it's gonna work out it's gonna be good just out of spite i need

05:21:06,860 --> 05:21:29,159
for pretty hard 480 that's actually not bad that's actually really good i did i baby rattle too hard

1176
05:21:29,240 --> 05:21:34,040
what's wrong with the baby what's wrong with what's wrong with the baby what's happening to

1177
05:21:34,040 --> 05:22:03,029
the baby um i can't even fucking run away from these things thanks for the thousand souls now

1178
05:22:03,029 --> 05:22:13,180
fucking eat my ass i need a little bit more just attack them add a forehead to your comment

1179
05:22:13,180 --> 05:22:45,689
because i just just i'd say forehead too junior cover your ears junior cover your ears he's

1180
05:22:45,689 --> 05:22:55,669
cursing again here we go i am willing to get this to plus eight it's there i am at plus 168

1181
05:22:55,669 --> 05:23:05,459
plus 166 that's in that's in this becomes c scaling here by the way xc int b this is doing

1182
05:23:05,459 --> 05:23:12,119
a lot of damage now i'm not willing to do plus nine on this i don't know what i want to do plus

1183
05:23:12,119 --> 05:23:22,580
nine now we're gonna actually play the game i've got some good shit i'm ready i'm all geared up

1184
05:23:23,220 --> 05:23:34,840
i'm ready i wanted to go check out this down here how do i get here let's start from here

1185
05:23:36,090 --> 05:23:51,540
no wrong this is wrong right yes this is wrong

1186
05:24:04,819 --> 05:24:12,340
so where is this dungeon i'm assuming probably on the road and go down from the road maybe

1187
05:24:13,139 --> 05:24:24,060
if i were to go get this way maybe i don't know what boss has been the scariest so far um

1188
05:24:25,020 --> 05:24:33,779
scary as in design or scary as in god i don't want to do that fight ever again which one yes

1189
05:24:33,779 --> 05:24:45,799
i need to go up here oh uh well i never want to do that fight ever again it's probably done

1190
05:24:46,439 --> 05:24:52,580
i just found that fight to be just a monster gimmick that it was just like a frustrating

1191
05:24:52,580 --> 05:25:00,119
gimmick fight that i hated i'd say that one if you're talking about like scary and creepy

1192
05:25:00,919 --> 05:25:05,959
and just designed really really it probably the big uh the thing where i got the baby rattle from

1193
05:25:06,759 --> 05:25:25,860
big astral like centipede bug praying mantis thing yeah the nerds were up astral yeah the nerds

1194
05:25:25,860 --> 05:25:31,290
were up possible that was just crazy looking had the whole solar system on its tail it was really

1195
05:25:31,290 --> 05:25:53,270
cool all right so now the idea is can i go where's this road that's not a road it's not a road what

1196
05:25:53,270 --> 05:26:10,439
is it so where's the dungeon down to the boss area so what do i have to go up this way from

1197
05:26:10,439 --> 05:26:27,290
the boss area because i can't get down there from here yes so interesting okay so it's this way

1198
05:26:29,479 --> 05:26:36,540
let's go big baby we're gonna go find it we're gonna go prove to everybody that this was not

1199
05:26:36,540 --> 05:27:07,750
a stupid idea to waste a bunch of somber smithing stones it's the painting it is the painting

1200
05:27:08,389 --> 05:27:49,430

1201
05:27:50,150 --> 05:28:20,169

1202
05:28:38,540 --> 05:28:47,259
it's like up there where am i right now yeah it's right here okay i'm gonna mark this like with an

1203

1206
05:30:23,080 --> 05:31:26,970
let's try it this is very hard well great opportunity to try the baby rattle who just

1207

1212
05:33:34,090 --> 05:33:52,439
and we can get started with that sorcery shit okay don't think it's even worth fighting a lot

1213
05:33:52,439 --> 05:34:01,259
of these guys i got the chest there's probably something else down here maybe another time

1214
05:34:14,099 --> 05:34:25,939

dodged that accidentally holy shit they should be able to get hit more than once with that

1222
05:38:57,689 --> 05:39:01,689
baby rattle would be a lot better if i if they could get hit by more than one of those

1223
05:39:03,849 --> 05:39:10,900
that would be actually awesome instead it gives them invulnerability you know the dead word

1224

you got a spear i hate spears holy shit he's got a teleporter i thought i had time he's

1236
05:45:56,900 --> 05:46:39,000
and they take so long it's like one two three then he lets go this game i'm not dodging i don't care

1237
05:46:53,750 --> 05:47:01,560
okay what the heck's happening here i see stuff does it matter what do i need to do

1238
05:47:02,580 --> 05:47:06,259
holy shit i didn't know he was fucking i thought he was shooting the bow and arrow

1239
05:47:06,259 --> 05:47:43,369
what why did he come over here what the fuck i hate you i don't know um oh we're going this way

1240
05:47:48,500 --> 05:48:22,020
uh i had that backstab i don't want to fight him anyways fucking don't care i don't want to fight

1241
05:48:22,020 --> 05:49:18,650
that guy so i don't care there it is no i'm farming for souls that i want to die at the boss the boss

1242
05:49:18,650 --> 05:49:46,299
are gonna be hard yeah well it's open but there's no boss bog hey there is okay all right this is

1243
05:49:46,299 --> 05:50:02,810
gonna be fun ah this is gonna be fun i'm just trying to throw a tantrum i mean it does a lot

1244
05:50:02,810 --> 05:50:24,860
of damage it just takes a long time to happen and it's cool when it hits it's really cool

1245
05:50:30,889 --> 05:50:52,250
i mean it's awesome it's really cool the move is amazing when it hits five that does like 900

1246
05:50:52,250 --> 05:51:10,299
damage if it actually lands 550 i mean it's good i mean look at that 600 that's a 1200 damage if it

1247
05:51:10,299 --> 05:51:42,119
hits i think i have enough was it 40 000 42 000 kill one more if it hits yes that's free

1248
05:51:43,159 --> 05:52:05,220
not fighting that guy try the katana again um i mean i love the katana 42 of course it is

1249
05:52:05,299 --> 05:52:15,459
i just walked off the weapon this weapons driving me insane why is this weapon why is it driving

1250
05:52:15,459 --> 05:53:04,389
you insane it's a cool weapon it's bad yeah it doesn't mean you can't have fun with a bad weapon

1251
05:53:04,950 --> 05:53:28,729
it's not even a bad weapon it's really not just got bad range yeah you know why the katana really

1252
05:53:28,729 --> 05:53:32,889
is better and why the katana is like one of the best weapons in the whole game because it has

1253
05:53:32,889 --> 05:53:43,880
bleed all right we just unlocked a very important milestone i have 52 intelligence which means

1254
05:53:44,599 --> 05:54:10,150
boys and girls got it you can actually use this thing actually use it look at the speed look at

1255
05:54:10,150 --> 05:54:21,990
the speed how much is the lung that does happen way faster if you don't know why i've been putting

1256
05:54:21,990 --> 05:54:31,529
points into intelligence not just for the scaling also because this thing makes all of my sorceries

1257
05:54:32,490 --> 05:54:38,490
cast speed way higher and new spells too that's right but we will play with those very shortly

1258
05:54:39,209 --> 05:54:44,200
what i want to do right now is just go get my ass kicked from a boss that's in this room

1259
05:54:47,099 --> 05:54:50,139
i don't care i'm not trying to i'm just trying to see what the boss's

1260
05:54:50,139 --> 05:54:57,419
moves are i don't really give a shit about beating it first time it's going to be really fun when i

1261
05:54:57,419 --> 05:55:04,779
start actively actively complaining about how bad this weapon is after losing to the first what

1262
05:55:04,779 --> 05:55:09,779
boss is going to do two moves and hurt me and kill me uh putrid tree it's another one of these

1263
05:55:11,220 --> 05:57:21,130
still hit me fuck wrong bus shit it's a little longer fuck wasn't bad okay wasn't bad it actually

1264
05:57:21,130 --> 05:57:36,310
did some pretty decent damage we're gonna do a test see let's see how this is the bit is over

1265
05:57:36,310 --> 05:57:53,220
go back to the real weapon i think it's actually doable because that was doing about 1200 damage

1266
05:57:53,779 --> 05:58:08,740
it just takes a long time let's see how much this does in comparison i know it's not even

1267
05:58:08,740 --> 05:59:21,939
fucking like that's not even a contest happens so much faster that and the stagger and grady

1268
05:59:22,740 --> 06:00:43,700
things fucking this weapon's unbelievable goodbye first try with the fucking katana

1269
06:00:44,900 --> 06:01:00,970
fucking fuck the katana is insane the katana is insane katana is staggering like a two-handed

1270
06:01:00,970 --> 06:01:18,599
hammer damn i think we're just spoiled by how good the katana really is and that's a new name

1271
06:01:18,599 --> 06:01:28,569
spirit too all right so here's the play here here's your here's your play i i want to play

1272
06:01:28,569 --> 06:01:32,650
with the baby rattle i'm very actually do want to play with it i don't think we gave it enough

1273
06:01:32,650 --> 06:01:45,159
chance by the way it's time to upgrade sorcery shit i got a flask upgrade i want to go back to

1274
06:01:45,159 --> 06:02:02,680
using sorcery so this is how we do it i got a bunch of new sorceries i can do and look if a

1275
06:02:02,680 --> 06:02:07,080
boss is giving me too much trouble then whip out the fucking katana and just let his head off

1276
06:02:14,740 --> 06:02:27,669
okay so i got a lot of souls it's time to leave i got a bunch of uh ashes too right there's a

1277
06:02:27,669 --> 06:02:39,430
casting speed talisman wow where is this right here a lid this edge here i mean that boss was

1278
06:02:39,430 --> 06:02:47,029
like kind of all right the reason why so that boss remember the first time i fought that boss

1279
06:02:47,669 --> 06:02:55,259
it was like 10 levels under level for it we've seen that same snake lizard monster enemy like

1280
06:02:55,259 --> 06:03:01,380
three times now so i kind of already knew the move set so i was pretty prepared for that

1281
06:03:03,799 --> 06:03:07,159
say that it was the same exact move set the only difference was it was

1282
06:03:07,159 --> 06:03:28,819
rot instead of lightning so there's a there's quite a few of those let's level up all right

1283
06:03:28,819 --> 06:03:34,310
uh it's time to examine some spells that i can now use this is a shit load now that i want to try

1284
06:03:34,950 --> 06:03:39,909
especially with this new incredibly better scaled and i'm going to go upgrade it again so here we go

1285
06:03:41,830 --> 06:03:51,000
first slot swift glint stone is is good it's good just kind of like oh i got comet now

1286
06:03:51,959 --> 06:04:18,200
that takes a whole fucking mana bar that takes so much mana i wonder how much damage that actually

1287
06:04:18,200 --> 06:04:26,919
does all right but anyways i think swift glint stone shard is good for just agro it's good for

1288
06:04:27,479 --> 06:04:42,869
chip damage i'll do comet after that and where are the other ones okay there's eternal darkness

1289
06:04:45,610 --> 06:04:50,759
forbidden sorcery creates a space of darkness that draws in sorceries and incantations the

1290
06:04:50,759 --> 06:04:59,139
sorcery can be cast while in motion okay i got another one too where is it there it is night

1291
06:04:59,139 --> 06:05:10,650
comet fires a semi-invisible magic comet the sorcerer can recast repeatedly okay collapsing

1292
06:05:10,650 --> 06:05:23,319
stars was another one and then what else magic downpour no crystal release crystal release

1293
06:05:23,880 --> 06:05:58,779
okay let's check these out right that's awful i can't move during this that's you have to

1294
06:05:58,779 --> 06:06:09,849
stand completely still okay what about i gotta know eternal darkness whoa what does this do

1295
06:06:09,849 --> 06:06:23,080
you only have one active wait this sucks up sorceries so i could literally just sit here and

1296
06:06:23,080 --> 06:06:35,220
cast okay that's actually good to have on the bar night comet what's the difference between that

1297
06:06:35,220 --> 06:06:56,380
and regular comet that looks good i like the way that one looks stealthier i don't have seeds

1298
06:06:57,340 --> 06:07:10,069
it absorbs spells it's harder to see in pvp this thing actually looks pretty insane

1299
06:07:10,069 --> 06:07:16,650
i wonder how much damage that does we get it tested on somebody that one looks good

1300
06:07:21,819 --> 06:07:26,619
omit with plus 60 with 60 plus intelligence and you never would have to melee anything again

1301
06:07:27,419 --> 06:07:37,450
yeah but the problem with that is i need way more mana it's tested on this person never you

1302
06:07:37,450 --> 06:07:45,220
i don't know if that was me hurting them or if he fell and he literally did that little damage

1303
06:07:46,659 --> 06:08:11,419
well that's fucking dog shit did i just stagger him though upgraded this is more than the other

1304
06:08:11,419 --> 06:08:30,549
one is hold on it's probably this enemy type yeah run on some normal guys yeah it's really

1305
06:08:30,549 --> 06:08:35,740
cheap to cast i want to see how much comet does not on these guys because these guys are obviously

1306
06:08:35,740 --> 06:08:51,700
beefy bulky bozos but i'm still gonna do it that's in actually insane for how much

1307
06:08:52,500 --> 06:09:09,099
you know what i mean 466 damage these guys are insanely resistant that's big all right

1308
06:09:11,060 --> 06:09:17,369
oh what else do i got this thing's cool this is cool but i don't think i want it

1309
06:09:17,930 --> 06:09:26,490
i think i keep on loretta's great bow it's been tried and true this thing is stupid so it's coming

1310
06:09:26,490 --> 06:09:37,540
off we're still barrage i remember this this thing was we laughed at this we made fun of this

1311
06:09:38,259 --> 06:10:01,270
i wonder if this is better with more scaling all right i need to go upgrade big time and i have to

1312
06:10:01,270 --> 06:10:06,759
go check out the dragon stuff too time is it how long have i been streaming for

1313
06:10:19,860 --> 06:10:27,669
what am i missing i probably need some more yeah i need smithing stone five for this i don't think

1314
06:10:27,669 --> 06:10:35,849
the giant sells five i have to go get them find them somewhere this goes to s scaling after this

1315
06:10:36,650 --> 06:10:50,299
i mean that's a huge fucking deal s scaling uh i'm gonna pee i'll be back we'll figure this out

1316
06:10:50,939 --> 06:16:19,479
drb three minutes i'm gonna get some water okay how are you how you doing good you're going

1317
06:16:21,349 --> 06:16:34,259
uh i need to figure out where to get somber smithing stone five i didn't have any music shit

1318
06:16:34,259 --> 06:16:56,840
oops did you beat the big boss in the desert are you talking about radan because i did it was

1319
06:16:56,840 --> 06:17:22,950
horrible all right let's come back now i think we're gonna have to i think we're gonna have to

1320
06:17:23,830 --> 06:17:44,340
i don't know i need smithing stones i could also probably do with another sacred tier or two

1321
06:17:47,799 --> 06:17:52,790
and another flask and that seems that's all right but

1322
06:17:52,790 --> 06:17:59,979
i have no more love warts

1323
06:18:07,990 --> 06:18:18,939
so what are we doing i got the coin to where where is that grand lift that's what i want to do now

1324
06:18:19,500 --> 06:18:30,279
no i don't i want to see what this is we're gonna do that north leonia i want to see what that does

1325
06:18:30,279 --> 06:18:46,970

1326
06:18:47,689 --> 06:19:08,840
let me do this first though this thing's really world shaking yeah in there oh but that's a

1327
06:19:08,840 --> 06:19:18,310
gigantic pot that pot's in fact as big as a building so you guys must be thrilled right now

1328
06:19:18,950 --> 06:20:08,389
sky shot uh i gotta go around haven't been here excuse me i gotta go all the way around dude

1329
06:20:08,389 --> 06:20:16,099
come on really this is gonna kill me isn't it oh come on look at all that's not that far

1330
06:20:38,790 --> 06:20:48,979
where's the fastest fucking way to get over there i don't from here that was so far no it's not

1331
06:20:48,979 --> 06:21:05,979
it's not that far it's not it's not far i don't want to hear it what if you fell from that far

1332
06:21:05,979 --> 06:21:13,529
i'm not a magical baby okay if i was a magical baby i don't think i would die if i fell from

1333
06:21:13,529 --> 06:21:47,029
that far no i'm not sorry contrary to popular belief i'm not a magical baby now we go this way

1334
06:21:50,729 --> 06:21:58,099
and from here i have to keep this in mind because i gotta go around but where's a safe place i can

1335
06:21:58,099 --> 06:22:14,729
go around that way no it's the best way to get over there from here it's a magical baby

1336
06:22:15,610 --> 06:22:33,049
it would have been bad all right i see a dungeon down there and i want to go look at it

1337
06:22:33,049 --> 06:22:49,450
oh i'm gonna take more machine things this is just a boss uh no no i want a bonfire what happened

1338
06:22:49,450 --> 06:23:07,189
here i want a bonfire what the fuck why am i like a rodent get what the hold on

1339
06:23:23,099 --> 06:23:57,740
all right oh my god press the right button for once in your life 700 fucking damage

1340
06:23:59,900 --> 06:24:12,900
that was crazy all right comet is good very good comet is very very good i need a bonfire here

1341
06:24:13,459 --> 06:24:45,689
there's got to be one right here somewhere there's one that one anything looks good compared to

1342
06:24:45,689 --> 06:24:51,430
crystal barrage i mean i think comet really is just a fantastic move though always has been

1343
06:24:53,880 --> 06:25:00,439
i want to go in that dungeon but probably you need to level up one more time but see if i can do it

1344
06:25:00,439 --> 06:25:38,520
but we'll explore a little bit let's check and see i do want to buy i do want to level up one more

1345
06:25:38,520 --> 06:26:21,909
time what the fuck what was that oh it's these guys shut up all right it's time for the baby

1346
06:26:21,909 --> 06:26:48,020
rattles to really show us why i got it in the first place that's it for here that's sick yeah

1347
06:26:48,020 --> 06:27:01,000
no it is that's some sick shit you're right it's very cool it's a really good ambush weapon

1348
06:27:06,340 --> 06:27:37,319
oh look what the internet taught me 31 000 damage the guide told him that no i saw i saw a gif

1349
06:27:38,040 --> 06:27:46,040
i've been avoiding everything elden ring but i saw this gift i was like that was fucking cool

1350
06:27:46,599 --> 06:27:57,130
that was a pretty sick gift it wasn't a gif in the guide there's no guide it's fun to do that

1351
06:27:57,130 --> 06:28:09,080
though all right it's cool to do this you all know it like that spin and i think that pretty

1352
06:28:09,080 --> 06:28:21,880
much wraps it up although i need myself i'll go down and it's probably something cool down there

1353
06:28:30,360 --> 06:28:48,680
oh there's so many of them i'm only getting 25 souls for each one of these idiots it's not

1354
06:28:48,680 --> 06:29:06,299
even worth doing that was that was like 30 people that i just killed all right i need to find a

1355
06:29:06,299 --> 06:29:21,540
little space to level up dungeon here uh was it just a boss though it looked like just a boss door

1356
06:29:22,819 --> 06:29:28,389
or am i stupid and misremembering the thing that i just looked at it looked like a boss door

1357
06:29:40,040 --> 06:29:44,380
not a hard boss so what you're saying is i should just get in here and kill this thing

1358
06:29:44,380 --> 06:29:48,939
and this shouldn't be a big problem and i i it's a probably pretty easy boss

1359
06:29:49,819 --> 06:29:57,380
all right so i gotta prove myself here then what are you saying i got 35 000 uh souls on the line

1360
06:29:58,340 --> 06:30:02,340
and i gotta prove that i don't i'm not just like a katana

1361
06:30:03,139 --> 06:30:10,950
roch andy is what you're saying okay i get it i could i could see how you could be you could

1362
06:30:10,950 --> 06:30:24,729
think that yeah i could see that i could understand that uh criticism all right fine

1363
06:30:25,290 --> 06:31:20,700
i'll go do it right now okay i'll go do it right now let's go what an opener oh that was like the

1364
06:31:20,700 --> 06:31:29,110
fight to you this is like the baby rattle fight that was actually the baby rattle fight there's

1365
06:31:29,430 --> 06:31:57,259
that was like the item to bring here oh my god some bronze shield depicting the face of a fire

1366
06:31:57,259 --> 06:32:15,220
giant several tongues leap from its open mouth tongues of fire really holy shit this thing is

1367
06:32:15,220 --> 06:32:45,750
big this thing is irritatingly large it's a dud this thing's a dud i'm too weak oh that's a crazy

1368
06:32:45,750 --> 06:33:06,729
item that's what i use that's the best parry shield in the game yeah and i two-handed try

1369
06:33:06,729 --> 06:33:27,669
it still doesn't work imagine how shit you could have a place root b if i mean like i know it's

1370
06:33:27,669 --> 06:33:45,479
like funny and shit but wow how unbearable would this be that i can't use it i know people do it

1371
06:33:45,479 --> 06:33:52,150
though people do shield they upgrade the fuck out of the shield and i mean it doesn't i mean that's

1372
06:33:52,229 --> 06:34:02,459
bad but it probably scales okay see the people running around with two shields

1373
06:34:03,669 --> 06:34:19,900
like this i remember this strat people used to do this shit he's like okay buddy you having a good

1374
06:34:19,900 --> 06:34:32,490
time it looks like i'm trying to make myself a makeshift 1910 flying machine that's what this

1375
06:34:32,490 --> 06:34:41,909
looks like i've got like the big puffy airbag i've got aerodynamic head i've got weird shit on my

1376
06:34:41,909 --> 06:34:47,590
back like a sail and wings this is this is the 1910 we have to get somebody in a personal flying

1377
06:34:47,590 --> 06:35:07,979
machine okay that's very cool that was cool all right now i just need to level up a little bit

1378
06:35:07,979 --> 06:35:28,330
let's get the comet out what do you say the 1910 cotton candy build it's got splash damage on it

1379
06:35:28,330 --> 06:36:01,459
too it's crazy what is that thing get it away from me rattle can't be good i can't believe it

1380
06:36:01,459 --> 06:36:11,099
is fucked well you better believe it because it's not it's actually not a bad item all right

1381
06:36:11,099 --> 06:36:17,020
what was the goal the goal was to get to this building up here right i'm i gotta i gotta focus

1382
06:36:17,020 --> 06:36:30,150
i have to level up but still i gotta focus on what the hell i was doing are you oh my god oh my god

1383
06:36:30,150 --> 06:36:37,900
oh my god i'm dead i saw that come from a mile away and i didn't do anything about it i just

1384
06:36:38,459 --> 06:36:45,930
i stood there i was just sitting there looking at him in my mind it was there's no way he's

1385
06:36:45,930 --> 06:36:53,299
gonna come this far there's no way he's gonna come all the way over here he just kept his head down

1386
06:36:54,419 --> 06:37:18,740
like this and just dragged it on the ground across what seemed to be the entire game that makes such

1387
06:37:18,740 --> 06:37:26,580
a funny sound all right stop fucking around and just leave i don't even need to be he just hit

1388
06:37:26,580 --> 06:38:22,020
his friend do i have enough to level up yet i'm sick of you why is it fire everywhere who's shooting

1389
06:38:22,020 --> 06:38:32,680
the fire dude you can double it up did you see that so you can go charge it wham wham and that's

1390
06:38:32,680 --> 06:38:40,490
13 1400 damage at least it's actually insane okay cool i need more intelligence and i need to get

1391
06:38:40,490 --> 06:38:50,279
this thing leveled up so it scales better it it looked like scrappy do in the scooby-doo movie

1392
06:38:50,279 --> 06:38:56,090
where they get all fucked up from the souls i don't know that's very specific i don't think i know

1393
06:38:56,090 --> 06:39:25,419
what you mean i don't know what that means okay one with mr bean you know what we're doing we're

1394
06:39:25,419 --> 06:39:32,520
doing sorcery again doing intelligence again i'm getting this shit to 50 intelligence before i do

1395
06:39:32,520 --> 06:39:43,369
anything else all right now the plan was i was gonna go there so that's what i'm gonna do

1396
06:39:44,250 --> 06:39:51,319
i need mind all right the next time i get like two or three points it's a lot of it's going into

1397
06:39:51,319 --> 06:40:22,740
mine there's really another one right here mine gets better as you level it up i think basically

1398
06:40:22,740 --> 06:40:35,400
the opposite of all the other stats really there is one of these trees over here too

1399
06:40:36,279 --> 06:41:27,450
usually aren't they usually like a weird tree boss well shut up get stop it just get out of here

1400
06:41:32,659 --> 06:41:52,840
i was doing something great sword just a regular great sword yeah i mean they it's got it got it

1401
06:41:52,840 --> 06:42:04,040
has to be in the game right so i have a question for all of you souls fanatics is there a reason

1402
06:42:04,939 --> 06:42:12,549
to use a great sword like that when all these other wacky fucking items in the game exist

1403
06:42:13,349 --> 06:42:35,819
horse iron lip of ultra great sword oh this is the gut sword yeah because i mean like but if you

1404
06:42:37,020 --> 06:42:44,069
i mean it's cool but if i feel like there's somebody there's tons of interesting weapons

1405
06:42:46,229 --> 06:42:52,979
it's almost hard to justify using just a regular weapon like for instance is any is anybody just

1406
06:42:52,979 --> 06:43:04,889
using a long sword just like this like who who's using like the dagger i'm just yeah i'm using

1407
06:43:04,889 --> 06:43:12,150
the just dagger it's the regular dagger so many cool things it's hard to justify you and they're

1408
06:43:12,150 --> 06:43:18,229
probably fine they probably scaled really well it's like holy shit the scorpion stinger the

1409
06:43:18,229 --> 06:43:27,319
redo via the mr record day like there's so much cool shit oh i'm gonna use the stock are you

1410
06:43:28,360 --> 06:43:37,319
because like there's so much other crazy shit in the game you can swap out blade arts on normal

1411
06:43:37,319 --> 06:43:45,860
weapons okay so that's a big deal that's a big deal that justifies a lot of reasons to use it

1412
06:43:45,860 --> 06:43:50,919
because you can put whatever you want on it okay all right that makes sense that's okay i get it

1413
06:43:55,750 --> 06:44:01,430
blade art plus infusion that's true yep okay yep you're right i stand completely corrected

1414
06:44:01,430 --> 06:44:14,360
you're right but there's gonna be one of those bosses here right isn't there always one of those

1415
06:44:14,360 --> 06:44:52,330
weird uh tree uh like death root or something i think there is yeah go find out hmm of a dungeon

1416
06:44:53,209 --> 06:45:07,500
point me into the direction of the dungeon there's a dungeon down i gotta go down that way anyways so

1417
06:45:07,500 --> 06:45:49,259
let's go and that's how you get down there is that a church is that an npc all right let's go

1418
06:45:54,439 --> 06:46:06,139
that is a church all right i'll get a tear from this this place looks so weird

1419
06:46:09,299 --> 06:46:25,020
it's moldering church there's cookbook another cookbook there's no sacred tear here usually

1420
06:46:25,020 --> 06:46:56,810
there's a tear right where's the tear no tear what kind of church is this what kind of church is

1421
06:46:57,529 --> 06:47:24,729
there's no tear didn't i already look at this the the guts right invaded by anesthesia tarnished

1422
06:47:24,729 --> 06:48:01,959
eater where are they oh would you look at you oh that hurts you a lot doesn't it easy sacred

1423
06:48:01,959 --> 06:48:11,819
scorpion charm godfrey at last at the end of his campaign his golden armies unvanquished and

1424
06:48:11,819 --> 06:48:26,790
unbowed it finds grace lost tattered and faded talisman raises holy attack ah that's not me

1425
06:48:29,900 --> 06:48:36,139
that's not me but i'm surprised there's no um there's no sacred tear in there

1426
06:48:36,939 --> 06:48:56,500
yes we need to go down that tree you just beat that poor man's ass yes i did yes i did very much

1427
06:48:56,500 --> 06:49:13,590
so where was the way to get down there this way there's only a couple exceptions usually

1428
06:49:13,590 --> 06:49:25,479
they're in the churches of marika okay well there's a boss i'm not gonna fight that while

1429
06:49:26,279 --> 06:49:27,000
surrounding me

1430
06:49:30,090 --> 06:49:38,220
fucking surrounded by idiots all right it's you know what i'm doing you know what at the time

1431
06:49:56,380 --> 06:50:01,750
what the fuck do you guys keep coming from stage left and stage right where do you people keep

1432
06:50:01,750 --> 06:50:17,020
coming from there's somebody just constantly behind me stop all right what do you got who's this

1433
06:50:17,740 --> 06:51:49,450
her tree appetite bad be better way better hello fuck i didn't know that they that that she was

1434
06:51:49,450 --> 06:52:20,950
i look they just blew up the fucking round you know what fuck the horse baby time what are you

1435
06:52:20,950 --> 06:52:36,020
doing why is it so much rot everywhere what's all the shit everywhere why am i running what

1436
06:52:36,819 --> 06:52:54,439
okay holy damage and rot damage okay please i mean that way i've got that that's this i'm

1437
06:52:54,439 --> 06:53:34,169
gonna destroy this thing get the fuck over here get this fucking puke off me it's a pot it broke

1438
06:53:34,169 --> 06:53:37,689
the pot it broke the pot okay it breaks the pot i didn't know it's gonna break the pot

1439
06:53:38,569 --> 06:54:03,979
maybe rattle is not bad it's really not talk a lot of shit about it but it actually is pretty good

1440
06:54:04,939 --> 06:54:19,340
that move is the only reason to have it on it's pretty easy to predict oh so okay it's one two

1441
06:54:19,979 --> 06:54:26,060
three it takes a while but if you get an opportunity okay if it didn't have the first

1442
06:54:26,060 --> 06:54:38,860
hit this weapon literally throw it into the ocean right the first hit makes this worth having it's

1443
06:54:38,860 --> 06:54:47,689
slow but it's good yeah if it didn't have that first hit it'd be terrible okay cool may have

1444
06:54:47,689 --> 06:54:53,990
been a little over leveled for this one but i have never i haven't been here i'm very curious

1445
06:54:53,990 --> 06:55:02,040
about what that is this flask i didn't even know i existed till fucking halfway through the goddamn

1446
06:55:02,040 --> 06:55:12,659
game where where is that flask shit okay barely boost stamina recovery speed barely blue stamina

1447
06:55:12,659 --> 06:55:20,919
so stamina or stamina recovery speed was fire attack i gotta go to all these trees because i'm

1448
06:55:21,240 --> 06:55:23,959
i guarantee it is like an intelligence one or like a magic one

1449
06:55:31,560 --> 06:55:46,860
ariel keeps pointing this way still there it is okay so here's the dungeon i'll get off my

1450
06:55:46,860 --> 06:56:05,060
horse we'll do this minor urtree catacombs it's one that gives you unlimited fp that would be

1451
06:56:05,060 --> 06:56:18,020
insane i have to imagine i could probably just come in here and clean up because although i mean

1452
06:56:18,020 --> 06:56:22,580
this is not this is seem this is pretty early okay if i if i would have it from limb grave

1453
06:56:23,880 --> 06:56:30,919
go up you know like three days ago i may have come across this area so i'm probably a little

1454
06:56:30,919 --> 06:56:53,259
over leveled for this stuff but it's free shit and i want it this is brought

1455
06:56:54,139 --> 06:57:34,619
it is oh those things are rot on the ground hey we're gonna do boys and girls very good

1456
06:57:35,419 --> 06:57:39,979
okay so why is it still building what's why is it still building i'm not even standing in it what

1457
06:57:39,979 --> 06:57:52,090
was that huh i'm not why is it building why is it building i'm not standing over here

1458
06:57:52,729 --> 06:58:27,049
how do i go up from here how do i go up can i go up soap doesn't do anything i don't see

1459
06:58:27,049 --> 06:58:37,400
anywhere to go up am i insane no there's no i got and maybe back up the elevator

1460
06:58:38,279 --> 06:58:53,900
there's nowhere to go here i'm going to all the way down the elevator for what for that

1461
06:58:54,700 --> 06:59:31,060
oh no right here don't i can't die in here that would be embarrassing even if you're

1462
06:59:31,060 --> 06:59:45,029
over leveled for an area imp cat head whoa this thing's awesome holds trace amount of intelligence

1463
06:59:46,680 --> 07:00:08,040
wait i lose one intelligence but that's so much more defense cat baby is that worth taking off

1464
07:00:08,040 --> 07:00:15,900
the intelligence i mean i'm so much more immunity robustness maybe it's worth just putting on keep

1465
07:00:15,900 --> 07:00:30,020
it on this is the worst outfit like i came out of the trash it looked like like dumpster melted

1466
07:00:30,020 --> 07:00:42,150
action figure baby like this is an action figure that you melted and threw it away just dumpster

1467
07:00:43,979 --> 07:00:59,619
dumpster action figure forked greatsword this is an action league now character

1468
07:01:00,419 --> 07:01:18,439
this is a rick and morty joke or or okay the costume for every horror movie villain from like

1469
07:01:19,610 --> 07:01:44,939
2002 forward every like scary person outfit heavy door is open i kind of like it though

1470
07:01:44,939 --> 07:01:55,700
it's a little too dirty i think i'm going to alter this and take the the bib off and i think i've got

1471
07:01:55,700 --> 07:02:18,810
my character a heavy door opened it's like burnt yucky skin dude what did you expect um where was

1472
07:02:18,810 --> 07:02:43,689
the heavy door after a heavy door no is there a heavy door down there let me i'm gonna alter

1473
07:02:43,689 --> 07:02:56,740
this let me see what it looks like oh i can't take the weird gross skin off of really i have to keep

1474
07:02:56,740 --> 07:03:46,470
the gross skin on i don't want to go through this do i have any more of those anti-rot things

1475
07:03:47,110 --> 07:03:57,180
okay okay first time crafting ever time to make some scarlet rot make seven of them okay i have

1476
07:03:57,180 --> 07:04:35,479
seven so there's a way to go this way this character makes so much noise now with this

1477
07:04:35,479 --> 07:05:39,860
baby rattle oh no grabs oh shit what do i i just i what's up here you're not real excuse me what

1478
07:05:40,340 --> 07:05:52,950
i could be a wolf head this is endurance endurance and okay so you can do endurance

1479
07:05:52,950 --> 07:06:00,939
or intelligence this is more kind of it's kind of more like an alligator than it is a wolf

1480
07:06:00,939 --> 07:06:20,979
i think i'd be a wolf sacramental bud this place is kind of big it's a ton more down there

1481
07:06:21,700 --> 07:06:32,900
uh that's just the beginning of the dungeon right yeah right i think so

1482
07:06:34,540 --> 07:06:45,450
i think of the jungle it looks like alf it did kind of look like alf

1483
07:07:01,669 --> 07:07:06,549
i don't know i better keep the cat away from me i'll eat the cat that guy fucking ate cats

1484
07:07:07,540 --> 07:07:12,099
right like that's kind of weird now thinking about that like 25 years later

1485
07:07:13,419 --> 07:07:18,139
oh i'm gonna eat your cat like you know you're gonna eat the cat at the household like our pet

1486
07:07:18,779 --> 07:07:27,900
he was always talking about like eating their cat like alf fuck off you live here for free you

1487
07:07:27,900 --> 07:07:33,900
stay in it for free if we feed you you don't have to do anything you run like a weird like ham radio

1488
07:07:33,900 --> 07:07:50,259
fucking station out of the basement you're not eating mr fluffy it's not gonna happen boomer show

1489
07:07:50,259 --> 07:08:02,889
can't relate plus old and maybe one day you'll binge it on netflix if it ever goes there the

1490
07:08:02,889 --> 07:08:21,220
dated reference all his references are dated yeah yeah yeah yeah sorry sorry i'm 36 sorry i'm 36

1491
07:08:23,740 --> 07:08:58,299
i remember alf your boss down here or what there is and that's a long run so i better be able to

1492
07:08:58,299 --> 07:09:03,180
one-shot andy i better be able to one-shot andy this it's probably very easy encounter

1493
07:09:03,180 --> 07:09:06,380
don't say that because if you lose you're gonna look like an idiot it's two of those cats

1494
07:09:07,340 --> 07:09:27,220
oh shit oh my god i did so much damage hey let's watch what do you guys say you want to watch

1495
07:09:27,939 --> 07:10:00,020
let's watch all right don't okay let's watch go get him come on baby he's plus eight he better be

1496
07:10:00,020 --> 07:10:29,939
good just do something he's drinking a potion okay is he all right he might do it no you can do it

1497
07:10:30,020 --> 07:10:34,790
come on drink another potion drink another potion another potion you got you got another

1498
07:10:34,790 --> 07:10:42,099
one drink drink drink drink drink drink drink what is he doing that's the worst move in the game

1499
07:10:42,099 --> 07:11:59,240
that's the worst move in the game fuck off mad pumpkin head ashes okay that's kind of cool

1500
07:12:00,040 --> 07:12:12,700
mimic has your genes i'm sorry i would not cast collapsing star at this enemy he was just sitting

1501
07:12:12,700 --> 07:12:19,220
there getting pummeled his brain couldn't figure out what to do this charge r2 does so much damage

1502
07:12:19,220 --> 07:12:26,069
yeah this thing is actually good we just been we gave this way too much shit because the katana

1503
07:12:26,069 --> 07:12:29,509
is just like a broken unbelievable weapon it's the best weapon probably in the whole game

1504
07:12:29,509 --> 07:12:33,590
so everything else by comparisons like wow that thing sucks but no this thing's actually really

1505
07:12:33,590 --> 07:12:47,000
good if you can get this down especially during boss encounters it's like 1200 plus 1500 damage

1506
07:12:47,000 --> 07:12:55,529
when you do it this thing's really cool like eight out of 10 pvpers are using that katana

1507
07:13:00,380 --> 07:13:07,060
yeah i mean that holy shit i like it i think it's actually really cool i think it's it's fun it's

1508
07:13:07,060 --> 07:13:17,580
really cool looking all right so now that i did that let's head back to the entrance striking

1509
07:13:17,580 --> 07:13:27,020
damage yeah that's what i'm saying if you can get both if you hit the cat part and the explosion

1510
07:13:27,020 --> 07:13:45,270
will just is an extra especially when i and you know what all right all right decision has been

1511
07:13:45,270 --> 07:14:33,060
made let's go plus 10 plus nine i think this thing this is going to carry us steak i don't

1512
07:14:33,060 --> 07:14:44,250
think so because i honestly think that that left trigger is arguably arguably better than the

1513
07:14:44,889 --> 07:14:51,689
katana's l2 for one reason because it gives you more than one opportunity to hit it

1514
07:14:54,139 --> 07:15:04,520
this is a one trick andy weapon that's fine this is going to scale well with int it's already

1515
07:15:04,520 --> 07:15:12,810
doing as much damage right now as the katana i'm going to stick with my decision to get the

1516
07:15:12,810 --> 07:15:31,299
baby rattle to plus 10 let's do a little bit of an examination here 179 189 we're at

1517
07:15:32,259 --> 07:15:48,740
what we're going to see this okay 553 545 this has bleed it does which makes it ridiculous

1518
07:15:48,740 --> 07:15:58,380
but this is starting to fall off with magic scaling if both b and c this would be like 5

1519
07:15:58,380 --> 07:16:19,000
like 80 maybe with plus 9 you can compare it okay here we go so why is it lower what b

1520
07:16:19,720 --> 07:16:27,909
is it a lower b is like a b minus this is a plus 10 no it's plus 9 uh plus 9 versus plus 8

1521
07:16:28,470 --> 07:16:37,270
oh it's because of yeah right i mean this is a this is obviously a better weapon right let's be

1522
07:16:37,270 --> 07:16:54,229
obvious but i think this thing is gonna really shine somewhere okay what time is it let's get

1523
07:16:54,229 --> 07:17:04,810
we're getting close uh we're getting close to the end of the stream not quite yet i want to do a

1524
07:17:04,810 --> 07:17:13,990
couple more things i didn't even go to the area that i wanted to go to why is this marked no i

1525
07:17:13,990 --> 07:17:26,220
wanted to do this yeah i want to go to this urn tree because i want to do that painting thing

1526
07:17:26,939 --> 07:17:56,200
so i need to go i need to go this way just mark it i want to see the painting and there's a there's

1527
07:17:56,200 --> 07:18:05,880
probably there's an urn tree avatar that i didn't do here you don't die if you do this right i

1528
07:18:05,880 --> 07:18:11,419
thought you didn't you jumped into those things i thought you didn't if you jump into the wind thing

1529
07:18:11,979 --> 07:18:39,349
like if you jump down into it really i missed i wasn't close enough oh well i made it what is

1530
07:18:39,349 --> 07:18:50,869
what the what's with all the pots there's so many of them but that's accurate though right if i land

1531
07:18:50,869 --> 07:19:07,400
in that i don't get that's accurate right okay yeah i just thought i was losing my mind for a

1532
07:19:07,400 --> 07:19:44,569
second all right go oh very putrid too putrid holy shit okay well not uh i think we were on

1533
07:19:44,569 --> 07:21:36,180
the horse for this one this seems like a horse one what all right watch out for this holy shit

1534
07:21:36,180 --> 07:23:55,819
get that rod out of here all right again friendship friendship again yikes oh not a third swing i'm

1535
07:23:55,819 --> 07:24:47,619
fucking paranoid there is a third swing putrid you kill it by hitting it you don't there's no

1536
07:24:47,619 --> 07:24:57,540
time limit a hundred thousand souls what are you doing there's no time limit to beating a boss an

1537
07:24:57,540 --> 07:25:05,159
elder ring you want me to get in there and act like an idiot and go to overconfident hit him

1538
07:25:05,159 --> 07:25:12,299
like five times wrap around him five times and get killed no that's a lot of souls okay

1539
07:25:15,060 --> 07:25:29,529
what do those do makes attacks more likely to break enemy stances that's really good

1540
07:25:31,750 --> 07:25:52,090
rarely boost all damage negation uh so this is like this this takes one hit this is temporary

1541
07:25:52,090 --> 07:26:03,990
for a while this one's kind of cool but i feel like this would be actually the meta something

1542
07:26:03,990 --> 07:26:07,909
tells me you drink this before a boss fight you go fight a boss and you'll be breaking this stance

1543
07:26:07,909 --> 07:26:16,939
every five seconds i was hoping for a magic one but that's not it's not what we got let me go see

1544
07:26:16,939 --> 07:26:47,340
the painting all right this is it right here this is it i'm too high down there i got a hundred

1545
07:26:47,340 --> 07:27:27,619
thousand souls dude i got a hundred thousand souls that it right there that's it right there

1546
07:27:27,619 --> 07:27:40,459
is it safe is it safe to go down here that's literally it right there right there uh i don't

1547
07:27:40,459 --> 07:28:00,279

god please teleport mark it and come back please all right i'm gonna get into 50 and then we're

1549
07:28:43,689 --> 07:29:08,700

1550
07:29:08,700 --> 07:29:14,779
really cool that's a secret difficult parkour to get to this little thing and there's a teleporter

1554
07:31:07,029 --> 07:31:15,959
the middle nice aim the one the one spot that i couldn't do that on is where i fucking did it

1555
07:31:21,779 --> 07:31:46,169
way too cautious fuck at least it wasn't 100 000 no it wasn't all right i'm not hesitating let's
