00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:10,010
Hello, how you doing? Welcome to another edition of streaming with Jeremy.

2
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:20,819
Right, people don't know the real spelling of my name. Jeremy. A-E-R-I-M.

3
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:29,000
Hello, yeah, I'm on the toilet. Uh, sorry, I feel like every time I stream now,

4
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:35,659
I have like an opening with an apology video. Hey, sorry buddy, sorry that like the stream's

5
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:39,500
like three hours late. Uh, sorry that the stream's like two days late. Hey, sorry, guys, sorry about

6
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:46,420
this. But that, I'm gonna, let's go over this, because people, I don't want anyone to be

7
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:50,739
concerned. I don't want anyone to be annoyed. Uh, although I can't really control that 100%,

8
00:01:50,739 --> 00:01:56,060
but I'm gonna, let's just let, here we go. Uh, I kind of fucked myself up the last few days.

9
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:04,090
I'm doing some new stretches and some new yoga moves to help with the chest and spine pain.

10
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:12,939
And, um, I kind of got locked up in the middle of one, and I kind of fucked myself up.

11
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:23,020
So, that was fun. Can you fart? I mean, my body is physically capable of doing it,

12
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:39,509
but I'm not gonna do it for you. All the exercise is killing you. No, there's so many theories as to

13
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:48,490
why or what I did, I don't know. But, I, my like back and like shoulder area, kind of in the middle

14
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:55,370
of my back, straight through where like the rib cage is, on the right side, I think I like pulled

15
00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:01,289
something or pinched something trying to do some of these yoga moves. It's like, that's just funny

16
00:03:01,289 --> 00:03:08,889
on its own. Like, I'm the old fat guy that does the yoga shit and like goes to the hospital,

17
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:13,050
like hurts himself, of course. I didn't, I didn't go to the hospital, let's be never really clear.

18
00:03:14,009 --> 00:03:22,789
Um, but yeah, I'm trying to do it. I'm trying to move some of the muscle and the tissue around

19
00:03:22,789 --> 00:03:30,710
this area. Again, if you don't know, if I, I'll say it again, I have a three year going on

20
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:34,949
a chronic pain problem that I'm still trying to figure out exactly why it's happening.

21
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:42,389
And, yada, yada, yada, x, y, z. Okay, let's go, let's stream. Here we are.

22
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:55,979
You're practicing the sit and reach. I still don't, I get it, but I still don't get it,

23
00:03:55,979 --> 00:03:59,659
if that makes any sense. Anyways, today we're gonna play a game that I've wanted to play for

24
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:06,900
a very long time. And weirdly enough, the guy that made this game remade it this year and it

25
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:13,400
came out like seven days ago. Uh, those who know the M. Dickie games, I've always heard about them,

26
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:19,000
but I never played them. There's been a lot of requests to play Wrestling Revolution 3D

27
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:24,009
and I took a look at the trailer. I've looked at a little bit of shit about it. Don't want to

28
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:34,019
get too into it. Um, it looked insane, but he remade it. This is Wrestling Empire. I guess he,

29
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:42,649
remastered it. So I was like, oh fuck, well, I'll just wait for that one. And here it is. So

30
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:48,500
there's, I don't know about character customization. I don't know if we can make a character, but

31
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,779
in the last day or two, just kind of poking around, I've edited a few people. So I think

32
00:04:53,779 --> 00:05:00,180
we're going to pick a character that we want to be and edit that character and play as that

33
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:14,439
character in career mode. This game is fucking rad. I've, I've heard about it, but I have never

34
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:22,939
experienced it. So we're going to experience it together. And it's weird because I looked at

35
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:28,620
the control scheme of this game. I opened the tutorial and just looked at it and kind of walked

36
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:33,720
around a little bit and I'm just like, holy shit. This is, this is, it's like no mercy. This reminds

37
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:40,199
me of the old N64 games with the grapple. And then you're in a grapple and you hit up, uh, attack,

38
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:46,060
down attack, left attack. This feels very no mercy to me. And if this is the closest thing that I can

39
00:05:46,060 --> 00:06:03,959
get to no mercy, then this is going to be one of my favorite games. Important is your surgery

40
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:09,319
before the big stream. Well, I don't, sorry. That's why I was like quiet. I was like silent,

41
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:19,959
just reading. Oh, I fucking back. Anyways, um, no, I don't have a surgery on schedule yet.

42
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:25,480
That's something that I haven't, I have another doctor's appointment in a week and we're going

43
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:31,319
to go over the timeframe of when that will happen because there is a lot of major projects going on

44
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:41,899
that I don't like that. I'm not going to just cancel scream it. No, but anyways, let's go. I'm

45
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:46,139
ready. I hope this is not DMCA. Tell me immediately if it is, we're going to find out right now. Is

46
00:06:46,139 --> 00:07:01,029
this DMCA claimable? Yes, it is. So I'm going to try to find a way to, uh, I'm pretty sure this is

47
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:05,589
like a song. All right. We're going to make a character. We need a career mode. I'm not going

48
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:10,180
to tell you guys very much about this because I don't know much about it either. Let's go over

49
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:18,420
here. So this is M Dickie's wrestling revolution. And I know there's a lot of unlockable characters.

50
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:27,180
Is it not? Is this okay? I'll go. I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll be fine. All right. So where am I? Who

51
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:34,230
should I pick? All right. I made this guy. I made craft Ben. Uh, I made smoke. Uh, what else did I

52
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:42,519
make? I made like one or two people just messing around in the creator. Who do I, what, what does

53
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:51,910
the, okay. So there's green, this pink, and then there's purple pink. What are the different colors

54
00:07:51,910 --> 00:08:06,230
mean? It looks like pink is women. What is the purple? Oh, it's, it's heel and face. Oh, shit.

55
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:18,009
Okay. Well, what, what, what do we want to play as? Should we play? I don't, I, I don't want to play

56
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:31,180
as smoke. I just made this guy in like 10 minutes for fun. I play as smoke, but I, I don't, I don't,

57
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:36,570
I wanted to make a character on stream. I don't want to just play as this guy for my career.

58
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:47,379
All right. Well, we have to make him less popular because that's too popular. He has to have a

59
00:08:47,379 --> 00:09:00,809
fucking C-minus in every ability. EMCA, whatever. Look, what about attitude? Should I put that

60
00:09:00,809 --> 00:09:09,820
somewhere? No, we're making our own character. No, no, no. We'll have plenty of interactions with

61
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:20,980
smoke over the next two days. Okay. Who should I, okay. I want to be a, I want to be a heel.

62
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:31,960
How about heckle horn? I'm just going to recreate them anyways. Heel or face? Which one? I think I

63
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:49,059
want to be a heel. All right. I'm going to be heel. Let's, let's, let's edit heckle horn. Okay.

64
00:09:49,059 --> 00:09:51,860
I'm going to change that name. Let's all right with the theme music. What do we got?

65
00:09:52,500 --> 00:10:12,580
There'd be wicked fast cartoon clown sounds. I kind of like that. Enos music. You could slow

66
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:29,259
it down too though. Hold on. That's pretty, I like that too. Yeah. This like kind of, this like sucks

67
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:39,559
at like 80%. You actually doesn't, what do you mean suck? This sounds awesome. It's not like

68
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:47,669
I'm underwater. Yeah. I'm keeping that one. The name's got to change, but all right. Pyro,

69
00:10:47,669 --> 00:10:52,149
fireworks, fountains, smoke or full works? All right. We're doing full fireworks.

70
00:10:53,110 --> 00:11:01,769
Do I come in with a prop? Microphone, camera, bell, explosive, explosive,

71
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:17,690
baseball bat, chair. Why would I come in with a grenade? What the fuck? All right. How about

72
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:21,769
baseball bat? All right. Let me ask you guys. How popular do you think I am?

73
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:28,070
No, no, not just talking about twitch.tv. I'm talking about all everywhere. 60% popular,

74
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:38,620
70% popular, 40% popular. How popular do you think I am? No, no, no. Household name is like,

75
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:48,629
is at least 95%. No way. And if you really think about it outside of like the twitch sphere of

76
00:11:48,629 --> 00:11:55,669
content creators and community members, it's probably like this in like the grand scheme of

77
00:11:55,669 --> 00:12:08,070
things. Uh, but you're the sus guy. All right. You know what? That bumps you up at least a few

78
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:16,009
points. We'll just, let's do 65%. How does that sound? Strength? It's pretty bad, but no,

79
00:12:16,009 --> 00:12:18,250
I don't want to be like a piece of shit. I wouldn't really actually play the game.

80
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:27,700
My mom knows you exist, but that's because it's your mother and you probably talk about me at

81
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:34,100
dinner. You probably like do the sus face at dinner with, with like fucking green beans in

82
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:48,730
your mouth and your mother's probably sick of it. I, uh, 67% strength, 68% strength, 70% skill.

83
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:56,259
Uh, I think I'm, I think I am kind of skilled in a way. Now we'll do 70. Uh, it's going to,

84
00:12:56,259 --> 00:13:01,059
oh no, hold on. I don't want to be, it's going to be, it's going to be hard if I don't do it.

85
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:05,659
My dad watched your spore stream and thought you were stupid.

86
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:20,330
Whatever. That your dad had one small example of my stream. I'm going to put skill up to like

87
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:25,769
78 and agility down and the stamina is going way down, but no, I, it's going to stay at 65.

88
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:34,899
That looks good. My attitude is very good. I'd say it's 80%. My added, I have a very good attitude.

89
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:47,029
I do 82%, 80%. Okay. Now we can, can we get, I got to get off this like song. All right. Build.

90
00:13:47,929 --> 00:13:57,740
Yeah. Okay. 26. That's Oh, old. Can you go and go to a hundred? Who'd be wrestling at a hundred?

91
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:17,990
All right. We're going to just do me. Okay. Whatever. Four, six, two, seven, 10, four, six.

92
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:34,490
No, we're going to be, I'm doing me. That's so skinny. That's how much I actually weigh though.

93
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:44,870
All right. Can I like beef it up just for the fiction? Why is there a five, eight emote?

94
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:56,600
Whose emote is that? Why do they have that muscle mass? It used to be all right. I even, okay. Even

95
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:02,440
though over the years I've dropped a lot of the muscle from when I was working out, like

96
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:09,639
medical bullshit, I still got pretty big ass arms. And I'm not just saying that I got, my arms are

97
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:13,720
pretty fucking large and you've seen them and you know, that's never, that's never going away.

98
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:26,970
I think that's fair. I got big ass arms and big ass shoulders. All right. I'm okay with that.

99
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:35,610
I have like a tiny little waist, a huge ass, huge shoulders and big biceps and tiny forearms.

100
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:48,710
I look like an ant. I fucking, like a weird endomorphic ant body. Okay. That looks good.

101
00:15:50,139 --> 00:16:01,379
Uh, hair. I'll change this. Um, hairstyle one, hairstyle. Oh, there's different variations too.

102
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:10,149
Hold on. Let's, let's go to a variation. All right. That's kind of accurate. If I got a haircut,

103
00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:20,500
this is what it would look like. That's why I'm afraid to get a haircut. Why am I turning this

104
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,259
way? Oh, there we go. Honeytail middle. No, I don't want a low ponytail.

105
00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:42,730
All right. That's, that's not bad. It's not EMCA. I don't know what to do. Look, uh,

106
00:16:46,419 --> 00:16:49,700
well, look, well, and you know what? At this point, I've played this song like

107
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:57,220
eight times already. It's been played like 10 times. What? Oh, I make sure you mute it after

108
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:05,380
the 11th, 12th time it plays on stream. I'm already fucked if it's here. I think you swag

109
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:15,269
land gaming for the five community subs. Appreciate it. Yeah. At this point, like if

110
00:17:15,269 --> 00:17:21,640
you robbed the bank, like you go and it's like, oh, I'm going to rob the bank. I was like,

111
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:28,119
there are the registers open. You don't go, you know, I'll take a $5 bill. Oh, I've just robbed

112
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:42,420
the bank. I'm already robbing the bank. So I'm already here. He admits he's a criminal.

113
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:56,230
So you're going to rob the bank. You might as well go rob the bank in a Cadillac. No,

114
00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:01,589
that's what I'm saying. I'm saying like, if the bank is already being robbed, you're not going to

115
00:18:01,589 --> 00:18:27,109
ask for like $1.50 in quarters, which I have to shave like the top of my head. What is this

116
00:18:27,109 --> 00:18:36,789
shaving? All right. My hair is kind of like, all right, that's kind of like Lego hair, right?

117
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:46,470
Everybody says I have. It's your bulge. I thought you were serious. I was like, oh shit. It's like

118
00:18:46,470 --> 00:19:03,670
that. Okay. That looks fine. All right. Let's go back. Face. Let's talk. I got to get these

119
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:11,460
glasses off. How do I get this thing off? My, how do I get the glasses off? Okay. Yeah. We're

120
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:21,940
taking this off. Oh God. All right. We're going to the Lord of the Rings war. We're going to get

121
00:19:21,940 --> 00:20:01,609
the right face. Let's go. Here it is again. This is the song. Oh my God. That one's not bad.

122
00:20:05,609 --> 00:20:14,440
Neither is that one. These are not, that one's not bad either. Oh fuck. That's I think that's

123
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:19,460
the one. Oh yeah. That's the one for sure. I don't need to even see any other option.

124
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:39,480
No, no mustaches or beards or anything. That kind of looked like that. Mask. Do I wear a mask?

125
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:47,240
Why do you have a huge bulge? I didn't make that. The game made that for me.

126
00:20:53,210 --> 00:21:06,099
This is me in a shitty gambit costume. No, no masks. It's going to be me. Eyewear. Glasses.

127
00:21:10,579 --> 00:21:12,900
People are going to want me to wear the hat, but I don't want to wear the hat.

128
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:29,700
No, I'm going to go none. All right. No, we don't need any of that. Head shape. Normal. Slim. Chubby.

129
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:40,460
That actually is pretty good. That's kind of accurate looking. Does, don't he think?

130
00:21:41,019 --> 00:21:54,650
Squashed head. No, not that one. Not even close. Not that one either. Is it big nose? It might be.

131
00:22:05,609 --> 00:22:15,220
What the hell? It's this one. I, I don't think I can hear very many arguments against it.

132
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:27,910
Okay. I like it. I just realized I had all this chest hair. Hold on. Let me move my microphone

133
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:44,220
a little bit. What's wrong with my, oh. Material. Over pattern? Under pattern? Oh, okay. Hold on.

134
00:22:44,859 --> 00:23:04,710
There is something like an open vest. Yeah. Oh yeah. No, no, no way. Uh, how come, how come

135
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:13,779
I'm not seeing any of this? Under pattern. Over pattern material. Oh, that's why. Okay.

136
00:23:14,339 --> 00:23:25,269
Do I even have anything under? This is how Ken Shamrock used to come to the ring. I remember

137
00:23:25,269 --> 00:23:31,109
he used to have like this tiny denim vest that probably like was uncomfortable to be in.

138
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:51,130
He was awesome by the way. The tuxedo vest? All right. All right. All right. All right. All

139
00:23:51,130 --> 00:24:06,259
right. All right. I kind of like the, Hey, what time is it everybody? Uh, yes. Email from, uh,

140
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:17,990
D Entertainment. I don't know. I don't know who made this song. Uh, you are being sued for playing

141
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:28,230
my time 65 times in a row on stream. Each offense is worth $15,000. Therefore bringing your total,

142
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:44,390
uh, lawyer fees up to, I don't know whose song this is. Who sings this song? Whose song is this?

143
00:24:45,109 --> 00:25:22,099
This is Kanye? No, it's not. Is this Kanye? Kanye East? All right. I'm going with this because I

144
00:25:22,099 --> 00:25:32,440
don't know. I don't even care. Wait, this is fireworks? Does that say I am verified with

145
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:40,150
like a blue check mark or something? I feel like that's the kind of shirt people would wear around.

146
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:43,509
You'd wear that to Starbucks and just hope somebody looked at it and was like, Oh,

147
00:25:44,069 --> 00:25:53,960
you are? This is fine. I don't care. The costume doesn't match. I have like a bow tie.

148
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:08,170
No, no collar shape, tight or baggy. We'll do tight. Keep the choker on. I'm not keeping the

149
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:27,160
choker on every cover. Should I have tattoos? Elbow pads. All right. Yeah. Elbow pads, wristbands.

150
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:42,180
I want to keep the gloves on. Nope. Those are smoke. So I can't take those. Skeleton hands. No. Yes.

151
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:51,960
Why did they turn me into a Roblox character? I have to mute this. Otherwise, like, what the

152
00:26:51,960 --> 00:27:09,880
fuck am I doing? All right. Whatever. I'm going. Legs. It's just dick dastardly Richard's pants.

153
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:26,539
I'm German rumble. All right. Is it paint splatters? It's paint splatters. All right.

154
00:27:26,539 --> 00:27:34,980
We're going to do paint splatters. Just be in a diaper. I'm going to wear just swishy pants.

155
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:54,380
That's what I wear every day. It's like loafers. Oh God. Wait, why do I have? Hold on.

156
00:27:55,339 --> 00:28:04,009
Skirt with a swishy pants stripe on it and swishy pants. All right. I kind of want the shorts and

157
00:28:04,009 --> 00:28:21,380
the pants. Length. Bike shorts. All right. We're going to keep it like this. I just wear bike shorts.

158
00:28:33,609 --> 00:28:42,539
No, I like that. It's stupid. All right. This is my wrestling attire. This is my casual attire.

159
00:28:43,099 --> 00:28:49,380
I'm going to do this really quickly. What if my casual attire was a different person's face?

160
00:28:51,660 --> 00:29:04,789
Oh shit. No, you can't. I forgot what face I had. There it is.

161
00:29:09,049 --> 00:29:16,069
Yeah. You can't change that. That's too bad. All right. Casual would just be like a t-shirt.

162
00:29:16,069 --> 00:29:26,329
Worst game ever. I don't agree with that yet. I would just say big green shirt. That was just

163
00:29:26,329 --> 00:29:35,420
a German 95 colors, right? It's just like that kind of greenish blue and like pink. Yeah. Let's

164
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:56,819
do that. Oh, material. What is this second pattern here? What's this shit on my arms? Oh,

165
00:29:56,819 --> 00:30:17,319
that's arms. Okay. Okay. How do you make pink? This is just the Riddler. Well, you only think

166
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:22,940
it's the Riddler because they have those goggles on. Just wait till I take the goggles off. How do

167
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:30,460
you make pink? There we go. All right. There we go. But I don't want them to look like that.

168
00:30:33,049 --> 00:30:36,299
Yeah. A little lighter than that, isn't it?

169
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:50,779
It looks fine. No gloves. I'm not going to wear gloves just hanging out like at a coffee shop.

170
00:30:53,980 --> 00:31:10,069
Legs, we're going to do green and we'll do pink. Whatever. Yeah. Imagine how much of a fucking

171
00:31:10,069 --> 00:31:18,859
weirdo you'd have to be to dress in your channel branding colors every day when you went out to

172
00:31:18,859 --> 00:31:21,980
like the grocery store. Like, why would you do that? What would the point of that be? Why would

173
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:34,650
you be doing that? Why? It's a flex, but it wouldn't even be a flex though because nobody would know

174
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:42,380
that that's you. They would just see the colors and like this green and like pink and blue.

175
00:31:43,259 --> 00:32:02,220
It's a, it's very popular color scheme. It looks like an 80s workout video. Do I have 80s workout

176
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:23,450
video color scheme? I do. Don't I? Yeah, I do. Oh, that's fine. This is not matching the top.

177
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:38,259
Whatever. Do I really care that much? Maybe a little bit. Less blue. I think it's less blue.

178
00:32:38,259 --> 00:33:03,319
Yeah. No, less blue, less green, less red, less blue. 150, 3100. 150, 30, 100. Different material.

179
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:17,849
Oh shit. Okay. All right. Perfect. It's perfect. So that's casual. This is what I come to the ring

180
00:33:17,849 --> 00:33:35,349
in. Oh, and I want to change the, I want, yeah, I want tucked in. Yeah, that's better. And then

181
00:33:35,349 --> 00:33:41,660
referee. I don't think I need to change referee. This is, what do you mean referee? I can be a

182
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:48,230
referee. Can I be, can I do a career as a referee? Holy shit. This would be the best game ever.

183
00:33:48,789 --> 00:34:00,200
Can I just be the referee? All right. I'm ready. What just happened? Oh my God. I just freaked out.

184
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:09,510
All right. We're fine. Moves. All right. This is, I'm not going to take that much time doing this,

185
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:14,619
but like I kind of want to. So like, whatever, we're going to be here for a while. All right.

186
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:34,619
These are taunts. Oh, this is entrance. I like that. Haunt. Go away. Go to sleep. That's good.

187
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:43,320
I like that. Let's see if there's a German walk. I will put, that's footwork. Not that one. Not

188
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:52,659
that one. Not that one. That one's not bad. Here or there. Hold camera. I mean, I can come up with

189
00:34:52,659 --> 00:35:07,369
a camera. Invite applause. Make decision. Make a point. Middle finger. Microphone speech. Oh,

190
00:35:07,369 --> 00:35:16,780
that's good too. That's good too. I like that would be the combo. This is, I love this already. All

191
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:36,119
right. Hold on. We're going to do the footwork one. Not go to sleep. Yes. The Hulk Hogan. Classic

192
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:48,409
move. Special. Oh, this is what happens when you have a special. Do the rumble in this game. I'm,

193
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:55,699
look, I blocked out two days for this game. So it's today and tomorrow because I really

194
00:35:55,699 --> 00:36:01,909
feel like I'm going to be obsessed with this game for the next at least two days. Present.

195
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:19,050
Punch the air. Raise the roof. I like raised finger. Roar. Rub fingers. Oh, I don't like that.

196
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:31,530
All right. That one's fine. I'm assuming this is when you win. That's a static backflip. It's like,

197
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:51,210
holy shit. That's perfect. This would be wave. I like that. Yes. Movement. Unbelievable.

198
00:36:51,849 --> 00:37:10,889
Oh, I think I want power. Point at face. Point at chest. Pat stomach. That one's good. Stance.

199
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:29,429
Fists high. Fists low. Martial arts. Grappler. Low grappler. Powerful. Eminent. Default. I think

200
00:37:29,429 --> 00:37:38,500
I'd be a guy, I'd be like this. Let's see. Hands up. No, it'd be hands down. It might even be hands

201
00:37:38,579 --> 00:37:48,860
lower. Do you know what this reminds me of? Those of you guys that played like FIFA or MLB the show

202
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:55,739
or Madden, they had a playlist feature where you could go in and, oh, I don't want to hear this

203
00:37:55,739 --> 00:38:00,460
song that often. Maybe I want to hear this one a little less often. You could, you could remove

204
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:06,789
songs completely from the playlist. And I remember going in there when I was younger and just having

205
00:38:06,789 --> 00:38:11,750
the same two or three songs that I really liked on loop. That's what this is. Like I just, I only

206
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:21,289
have one song in the playlist that I like. The only one. Even in like the WWE games, I remember

207
00:38:21,289 --> 00:38:33,289
playing, what's Tess's song? Honest day, I see clearly, everything is clear. But that song,

208
00:38:33,289 --> 00:38:40,409
I used to play that on repeat when I was editing people. That's Edge. Well, whatever. Sorry.

209
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,960
I used to put that song on repeat while I was making Earthworm Jim back in like 2014. That's

210
00:38:48,599 --> 00:39:02,010
a real story. We're good. What a fake fan. Whatever. All right. That's gestures. I have to play

211
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:08,519
something else because I'm, I can't, I cannot listen to that for like another 30 minutes while

212
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:17,139
I make moves. And that's nothing to the song, right? That's nothing about what I feel about

213
00:39:17,139 --> 00:39:20,980
the actual song. It's just hearing it that many times in a row. I need to have something else,

214
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:28,650
right? So I'm going to put on like a little OST or something. I'm sorry. I have to. How about,

215
00:39:29,849 --> 00:39:37,670
what's something that I can just chill and make this character? Undertale OST. Oh, but that's so

216
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:50,059
good and so easy. Uphead music. Holy shit. What a brilliant idea. That's actually kind of a

217
00:39:50,059 --> 00:40:11,769
brilliant idea. Oh, it's good to turn it down. Okay. I can't hear this. Why?

218
00:40:11,769 --> 00:40:19,539
Okay. I don't know. Penis music. Why can I, why can I not hear this? But you can. That's kind of

219
00:40:19,539 --> 00:40:30,980
strange. Why can I hear this? Now I can't. Oh, because I'm stupid. I turned it down with my

220
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:40,469
mixer. All right. Let's go. I, I can handle this. This is like character creator music.

221
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:53,159
So we need, what have we got? Attacks. This is just like no mercy, man. I can already tell you. I

222
00:40:53,159 --> 00:41:00,869
already know. Can I beat puncher? I don't even, I don't want to look at any of the moves.

223
00:41:00,869 --> 00:41:16,300
Slap. Is there one that goes across the face? Not down. Is this DMCA? What? Is it DMCA?

224
00:41:19,929 --> 00:41:38,230
Fuck. Why? No. You know, it's crazy. Like a lot of video game musical artists that like just

225
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:42,710
kind of don't care. Isn't it weird that like a lot of their music is like just better

226
00:41:43,269 --> 00:41:56,659
than the shit that gets DMCA'd? Am I like, is that, is that a shit take? Tell me. But uh,

227
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:13,530
I'm not putting that back on. Skullgirls OST. Terraria is good. That's an easy one to go back

228
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:27,530
to. Yeah. Terraria OST. Great one. There we go. Okay. I think it's going to be the slap.

229
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:38,179
This one, it's way bigger. All right. That's slap. Lower attack. Left extension kick. I like left

230
00:42:38,179 --> 00:42:49,860
hook. That was not bad. I think it should just be punches. I would never kick. No, I, I physically

231
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:57,800
cannot lift my leg higher than probably the middle of my waist. I tell you, you and I ever

232
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:03,019
get in a fight, just go for the legs. Cause I, I will, I'm, I'm a puncher. You know what I mean?

233
00:43:03,019 --> 00:43:05,659
Like if I would, if I'm in a situation where I was going to have to fight somebody,

234
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:11,349
it would be a flurry of right and left hands. So fast that you wouldn't even just see them.

235
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:23,900
It would be like, and you were on the ground at like three of those ago, by the way. My legs are

236
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:40,730
useless. We'll do right hook. Big attack. Bicycle kick? No. This is me falling on my back.

237
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:50,070
For a second, I thought that was part of the move. I was like, Holy shit. Diving clothesline.

238
00:43:52,650 --> 00:44:04,650
Yeah. It would probably just be a huge punch. Holy shit. Although seriously don't underestimate

239
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:19,829
just running and jumping with all of your body weight at somebody. Right? How does that not hurt

240
00:44:19,829 --> 00:44:29,909
you more than it hurts the person you're doing that to? Headbutts pretty nuts. Wait, it is a move.

241
00:44:33,139 --> 00:44:42,360
Running attack. It would be that one. A huge running, diving punch in the face.

242
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:51,829
Well, I think this is off the top rope. I would, I would do a flip of some kind, right?

243
00:44:52,469 --> 00:45:01,559
But I definitely would be holding my neck because I would be kind of scared that I was going to like

244
00:45:01,559 --> 00:45:17,579
break my neck and hurt myself. Okay. That one. Flying kick. Flying clothesline. What is it?

245
00:45:17,579 --> 00:45:33,139
What's this one? Middle rope. Springboard attack. Moonsault. Oh, I think this is top rope. Super

246
00:45:33,139 --> 00:45:45,420
punch. Suicide dive. Wait, you just, I kind of want that one. Thrushes. Oh, so when they're on

247
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:50,550
the ground. Punches. The rest of these can probably be pretty quick until we get to the grapples.

248
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:59,860
What's this one? Big leg drop. Moonsault. Senton bomb. That one. Running move when they're on the

249
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:08,280
ground. How about, uh, how am I doing? I'm doing all right. I'm doing all right. I kind of hurt

250
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:17,750
myself a few days ago or a day or two ago, but you know, I'll be all right. I don't want to be

251
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:21,269
too ridiculous. Like this is way too ridiculous. I'm going to get so annoyed at doing these moves.

252
00:46:22,789 --> 00:46:34,679
Yeah. Just like a splash is fine. That's fine too. Springboard. That one. There is one thing

253
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:40,599
I have to make sure and I hope they have it. And I think they do is my finishing move has to be

254
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:57,130
the stone cold starter. That's incredibly important. This is top rope. Elbow drop. Yep.

255
00:46:57,130 --> 00:47:04,809
All right. We're almost done. Front moves. Oh God. Wait, who am I doing? I'm doing this myself?

256
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:17,659
Suplex. Monkey flip. Monkey flip. Clothesline. Chokeslam. There's no way I would be able to do

257
00:47:17,659 --> 00:47:27,429
that to somebody. This does feel like a workout video of some kind, right? I'm surprised this

258
00:47:27,429 --> 00:47:34,550
hasn't happened yet. Oh, like UFC workout. You need two people. Get one of your buddies over.

259
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:40,889
You're both going to be able to burn 500 calories an hour working your core, your abs, your obliques,

260
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:50,179
and your calves at the same time. You just kick the shit out of each other. Like you have to

261
00:47:50,179 --> 00:48:05,340
scoop slam your friend and then he scoops slams you. Only 500 an hour. Hmm. Oh, I like that.

262
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:22,070
Into the submission. Air crash. That would have hurt so bad. I like clothesline drop. Yep.

263
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:26,699
We've got monkey flip. I'm not going to have monkey flip be every move. So we're going to do

264
00:48:26,699 --> 00:48:31,659
this one over the shoulder. Well, there's no. OK, that was crazy. Piledriver. This move is banned,

265
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:45,739
but we're going to use it. I like that. All monkey flip. All right. We'll make a character

266
00:48:45,739 --> 00:48:49,820
eventually that has only monkey flip for a move and it's going to be infuriating. There it is.

267
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:53,099
All right. Well, that's my special move, though, not a regular move.

268
00:48:55,269 --> 00:49:05,130
I love this stunner. It's like the best move ever. Test of strength. Need that one. Actually,

269
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:14,889
if it's just a regular move, though, that kind of sucks. Work and run is pretty sick. Cross

270
00:49:14,889 --> 00:49:26,869
body is pretty sick. I like that one. Running. Spear. Run and slide is headlock take down.

271
00:49:26,869 --> 00:49:40,920
Just make it a headbutt. Running and down is DDT. That's cooler. Pick up move. Oop,

272
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:50,780
insecure. Sunset flip. What if every move was the stunner, though? Would that be better?

273
00:49:54,380 --> 00:50:01,420
Play the right version. What are you talking about? This is the way you want to play the old

274
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:05,980
version of the game. This is the one that just came out like six days ago. Why are you beating

275
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:22,519
up Hank Hill? Front power slam. I like it. Small package. Oh, I don't know, but they don't really

276
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:37,980
know. They don't really know me very well. Shoulder drop. Shoulder boulder screwdriver.

277
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:44,809
Holy shit, that would kill somebody. OK, momentum. Monkey flip. All right, fine.

278
00:50:44,809 --> 00:50:54,010
Running. I like that. High cross body. Diamond cutter. That was awesome. Hey,

279
00:50:54,010 --> 00:51:04,599
speaking of diamond cutter, didn't Diamond Dallas Page make a Pilates or a yoga program?

280
00:51:04,599 --> 00:51:11,420
And it's actually like one of the best yoga platforms you can possibly do. Isn't DDP yoga

281
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:18,630
considered to be like one of the top tier, like A or S tier yoga programs? Maybe I should get it.

282
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:38,090
Half crusher. Whoa. All right. That one's weird. I like it. All right, here we go. Stunner. This

283
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:45,860
is my special. This is my finishing move. But the tombstone is awesome, too. But there's no way I

284
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:54,309
would be able to do the tombstone. Stunner. Yep. Nice. OK, rear moves. These are less important

285
00:51:54,309 --> 00:51:59,929
after me, I think. These can be fine. These are all fine. Just like a face plant DDT. Yeah,

286
00:51:59,929 --> 00:52:11,019
that one's cool. How about rear special? Here we go. Dragon suplex. The electric chair. Oh,

287
00:52:11,739 --> 00:52:19,210
burning hammer. Holy shit. Abdominal stretch. Yeah, I did one of these like three days ago and

288
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:34,010
like tore a muscle in my shoulder. It sucked. I'm going to use it in the corner. Head smashes. Oh,

289
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:49,000
yeah, I like those. Yeah, I'm doing mounted punches. All right. So this is these are fine,

290
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:56,059
although I do want to do the the sharpshooter legs and attack. Do they have a sharpshooter?

291
00:52:56,059 --> 00:53:02,409
There it is. If you were in this, you would get right. The hitman heart put you in one of these.

292
00:53:03,289 --> 00:53:07,340
You weren't getting up. You were done right in the middle of the ring. You got nowhere to go.

293
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:23,460
It's over. Legs and run. Half crab. I want a Boston crab. All right, that's good.

294
00:53:24,099 --> 00:53:31,030
And I think that's it. I just don't want to be heckle horn. Relationships promotion. I'm in

295
00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:38,440
wrestling school. Roll wrestler. Oh, I could be a referee, but should I just be a referee?

296
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:43,239
No, I can't. We'll do that another day with another character. I want to be like a wrestler.

297
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:50,949
I want to be a heel loaning manager. I don't have any friends or anything. I'm just going to be like

298
00:53:50,949 --> 00:53:57,670
a lone guy. OK. All right. All right. All right. This is fine. We'll make our own friends and

299
00:53:57,670 --> 00:54:05,130
enemies as we play. I do need to change this name from heckle horn. I think I have to type it.

300
00:54:11,559 --> 00:54:23,239
I can end up press A. OK. All right. There we go. I can turn the terraria soundtrack off.

301
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:38,010
It was good. You can now go back to the actual game sounds. You might get to hear my time one

302
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:44,820
more time. All right. I'm ready. I'm excited. Yeah. I spent like an hour fucking around,

303
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:51,019
but whatever. I'm in for the long haul right now. At least today into tomorrow.

304
00:54:51,019 --> 00:54:58,619
I thought this was terraria still. All right. We're good. We're good. We're good.

305
00:54:59,510 --> 00:55:10,019
This is done. There's Jerma. Jerma985. I think I picked career. Are you ready? Are you ready to

306
00:55:10,019 --> 00:55:33,030
play? I think I know how to play. Let's go. Play career with Jerma. That's me. I'm ready to start.

307
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:42,340
OK. Wrestling school. July 2021. Singles versus tall order. Zero dollars. X zero weeks. Creative

308
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:50,119
control. I have five thousand dollars. What about gimmick? Oh, OK. I think I just go. All right.

309
00:55:53,289 --> 00:56:16,500
We got all order. How come there's nobody here? Wait, why is there a chair already?

310
00:56:19,559 --> 00:56:27,619
Wait, why is there a chair? Why is there a table? This is me. Oh, I got to wait.

311
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:46,789
No, get in the ring. Fucking ring. Why is there a chair? This is where your story starts, Jerma.

312
00:56:46,789 --> 00:56:51,449
What? You'll have to learn the ropes here each week. For some people, it never happens while

313
00:56:51,449 --> 00:56:58,219
others wish it because they've up back here broken. Why is he holding a chair? Be careful

314
00:56:58,219 --> 00:57:05,000
what you sign up for because there'll be a lot of promoters trying to take advantage of you. OK.

315
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,889
But if you look after yourself and make smart choices, it's perfectly possible to have a

316
00:57:08,889 --> 00:57:15,739
fulfilling career. OK. Anyway, let's see what you got before we see how far you'll go.

317
00:57:23,829 --> 00:57:38,250
Why does he put the chair down? Get off the top floor. Is he here? Wait, don't fight the coach.

318
00:57:38,889 --> 00:57:50,699
All right. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. Yeah, motherfucker. Pretty good. Can I use this?

319
00:57:50,699 --> 00:57:57,449
I'm going to use a weapon. I'm kicking the shit out of this guy. All right. Give me the. Here we go.

320
00:57:58,489 --> 00:58:05,780
Drop it. Drop it. Take it. Take it. Take it. Whatever. Get out of the way.

321
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:24,199
Ha ha ha. Pick him up. Pick him up. Give him the Boston Crab. Come on. Break his neck. Who's

322
00:58:24,199 --> 00:58:33,380
Blonde Blunder? Who the fuck is this? Get out of here. What do you do? What do I get from the

323
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:46,539
audience? It's two on one right now. This is not fair. How come the referee is not kicking this

324
00:58:46,539 --> 00:59:05,510
guy out of the ring? Yeah. Get him out. Get this guy out of here. Get this guy out of here. What the

325
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:26,260
fuck? Oh, this is awesome. I got to pick him up. Here we go. What is it? What's coming out of his

326
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:34,260
head? Pick him up. All right. We're going to do it. We're going to do Spine Buster. No, we're not.

327
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:45,530
I'm going to throw him. How do you throw him off the ropes? Ow. Hey, wait. He just kicked me in

328
00:59:45,530 --> 01:00:01,050
the balls. That's illegal. I'm not going to tap out. I'm fine. Get up. Here we go. Off the ropes.

329
01:00:01,050 --> 01:00:17,590
Why did he not? What the fuck? Hey, what's that? Wait, he's mad at the ref. I'm not fucking around

330
01:00:17,590 --> 01:00:33,769
anymore. How do you block? This guy's like two weight classes ahead of me. This is not even fair.

331
01:00:34,409 --> 01:00:49,780
This guy's like 400 pounds. I'm 150. Am I bleeding? There's not even an audience to do that for.

332
01:00:50,340 --> 01:01:13,139
Get on the top rope. I'm still winning. Oh, that was pretty sick. Pick him up. All right. I got

333
01:01:13,139 --> 01:01:21,349
him right. I must have a special, right? Get off. Why is he on the top rope? All right. Should I try

334
01:01:21,349 --> 01:01:46,170
to pin him? He just literally just kicked me in the balls. Get up. That's so stupid. Yeah. Thanks

335
01:01:46,170 --> 01:01:54,860
a lot, referee. It took you like a full three minutes to kick the guy out that was in the ring

336
01:01:54,860 --> 01:02:04,329
that shouldn't have been in the ring and he's still here. He just tripped and his face exploded in

337
01:02:04,329 --> 01:02:22,809
blood. How about the spin punch? Oh my God. It worked. Five minutes remaining. We're taking too

338
01:02:22,809 --> 01:02:37,139
much time. Why can he just do that to me? Reverse it. God, I just want to throw in a weapon so bad.

339
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:46,840
Um, hold on a second. No, not on the first match. I saw something down there. It's because you

340
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:59,940
dumped all your stats into attitude. Well, I'm, I better get some points for this. Oh, it's over.

341
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:30,389
Pin him. How do you pin? Oh, fuck you. Stay down. Pin him. I need a special. What the fuck just

342
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:55,079
happened? Oh my God. I think I killed him. Get over here. What the fuck was that? Ow. Ow, my chest.

343
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:02,250
I know this game is going to be bad for me. I already know it. I didn't even need to start. I

344
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:12,630
just started too. Oh, is he going to get up? Go on the top turn buckle.

345
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:43,369
Just taunting the ring. What happened to this guy? Oh shit. He grabbed me at nine. Are you

346
01:04:43,369 --> 01:04:59,099
fucking kidding me? No way. Get off me. There's only five minutes remaining. He's getting sick

347
01:04:59,099 --> 01:05:16,840
of this. Wait, you're going to get disqualified. Isn't he going to get disqualified? We're both so

348
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:24,659
fucked up right now. Why can't either of us win? We're both so fucked up. Just pin him.

349
01:05:27,210 --> 01:05:38,730
I can't win. Look at how screwed up we are. At what point does the ref stop the match? Because

350
01:05:38,730 --> 01:05:57,369
this is just embarrassing and horrible for both of us. What? This is the practice match? All right.

351
01:05:57,369 --> 01:06:08,969
I got to go for a big move here. Right here. Right in the head. Good night. I was at a one count.

352
01:06:15,539 --> 01:06:25,420
Stay down. Stay down. This one minute. We're about to hit the enrage timer. Does the referee start

353
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:41,769
fucking punching us? Get over here. All right. That's it. There it is. Wait, I've just received

354
01:06:41,769 --> 01:06:51,320
word back from backstage that this match must be restarted immediately. What? What are you talking

355
01:06:51,320 --> 01:07:02,179
about? He just gave me the finger. That guy just flipped me off. That's not fair. What are you

356
01:07:02,179 --> 01:07:39,480
talking about? What? He's just like killing me. I'm like puking. What the fuck? That's not fair,

357
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:53,059
dude. No. Give me that bat. Give me that bat. I'm here to challenge you to a match on the fourth

358
01:07:53,059 --> 01:07:59,539
week of July. Oh, you really? All right. If this is the only way to get your attention,

359
01:07:59,539 --> 01:08:10,659
you'll agree to face me in front of the whole... All right. It's a date? All right. Fuck this guy.

360
01:08:10,659 --> 01:08:16,100
All right. It's a date. Get off of me. I guess you're not the coward I thought you were. At least

361
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:24,600
you'll put up a fight before you lose. Wait, I'm fighting this guy right now? What are you talking

362
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:35,260
about? Isn't this the fourth of July? What day is it? What fucking day is it right now? I think

363
01:08:35,979 --> 01:08:47,300
that's blonde blunder. That's the guy. It says I'm fighting him. That's illegal. That's illegal.

364
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:54,279
Throw him out of here. That was illegal. He just threw a bat in my head. That's illegal. That's

365
01:08:54,279 --> 01:08:59,640
illegal. He just threw a bat at me. Okay. You know when you play Bloodborne and you go and you

366
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:09,960
kill like fucking 30 people, your clothes are just covered in blood. This is so unfair.

367
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:26,949
Just pin me already. Am I even supposed to win this? Stop. He's dead already. I know.

368
01:09:28,069 --> 01:09:40,729
How do I get out of... I have no control of the character. Okay. I have to pin this guy.

369
01:09:40,729 --> 01:09:46,619
Is there anything I can do to kill the... Okay. You know what? Fuck it. That guy didn't get

370
01:09:46,619 --> 01:10:10,680
disqualified. So neither am I. Yeah. Drop it. Okay. Are you... This is so stupid. I love it.

371
01:10:11,079 --> 01:10:20,710
This game is amazing. This is like the first match. Fuck you. Yeah. Disqualified, apparently.

372
01:10:22,819 --> 01:10:26,579
It's me who decides who wins and loses, Jerma, and I've decided that you're a loser.

373
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:49,460
Why can I still fight? I need a second. I need to take a... Hold on. I need like a five second break.

374
01:11:03,819 --> 01:11:10,500
Okay. So the wrestling review. In all the latest action from Wrestling School's training session,

375
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:17,619
Jerma was disqualified at 12 minutes and 17 seconds. Jerma's strength has risen to 70%

376
01:11:17,619 --> 01:11:28,020
after participating in that match. In all the latest action, Tall Order's profile has risen

377
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:34,090
after taking part in such a compelling match. Blonde Blunder has generated a buzz by interfering

378
01:11:34,090 --> 01:11:44,970
in that one and I made... I lost $200 because I used an explosive or something. Is that what it

379
01:11:44,970 --> 01:11:53,079
was? Expenses? What is this? I see you had fun out there, Jerma, but you made quite a mess of

380
01:11:53,079 --> 01:12:02,859
the arena. Okay. If we ever want to book this venue again, you better pay $100 towards the damages.

381
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:16,300
How about you referee? That's absolute bullshit. Why are there sticks of dynamite in your arena

382
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:27,899
lit that have like a hairpin trigger if they're touched? What are you talking about? That's not

383
01:12:27,899 --> 01:12:33,079
my problem. It really isn't. I suppose you're right. What did they expect when they let a

384
01:12:33,079 --> 01:12:44,630
wrestling show into the venue? All right. I got it. Third week of July. Your bat prop costs money.

385
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:53,050
I hope it doesn't. New middleweight champion. Booker Hudson has defeated Greg McMahon to become

386
01:12:53,050 --> 01:12:59,779
the new middleweight champion of Weekend Warriors. Crucial Kennedy feels great today and is in perfect

387
01:12:59,779 --> 01:13:06,710
health. Blonde Blunder has developed a heated rivalry with Jigsaw Jeremy of all American

388
01:13:06,710 --> 01:13:14,569
wrestling. Yeah, that guy sucked. Jerma's proposed match against Blonde Blunder on the fourth week

389
01:13:14,569 --> 01:13:27,050
of July has been canceled. Oh, so what was that all about? That guy just fucked up the whole match,

390
01:13:27,050 --> 01:13:35,180
came down, challenged me to a duel, and then canceled on me. I've had, and somehow I lost

391
01:13:35,180 --> 01:13:42,979
popularity. A lot of it. Okay. Well, proceed. All right. I got to win this one. Singles. Let's go.

392
01:13:42,979 --> 01:13:52,460
Who is it? Oh, wait, I thought he canceled on me. Wait, he canceled and moved it up to the third

393
01:13:52,460 --> 01:14:03,859
week of July instead of the fourth week of July. What are the rules of this match? Can he just hold

394
01:14:03,859 --> 01:14:25,350
that? Put it down. I'm not putting mine down until he puts his down. I'm not getting in there until

395
01:14:25,350 --> 01:14:42,250
he puts it down. The referee got a camera. Why does he have a camera? Wait, are we allowed to have

396
01:14:42,250 --> 01:14:54,409
these? Anybody who couldn't beat tall order doesn't belong in the ring with me. Tall order is nothing

397
01:14:54,409 --> 01:15:09,420
compared to me, and that makes you less than nothing. Holy shit. My mouth. That's so unfair.

398
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:19,619
That's unfair. That's unfair. I ran at him and he, I was like a bull. Get away from me. Why is my

399
01:15:19,619 --> 01:15:30,659
health so low already? He's just doing my moves. All right. I got to play this smart. God damn it.

400
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:44,710
Get that shit out of the ring, please. Here we go. All right. Slow and steady. I don't know what

401
01:15:44,710 --> 01:15:58,550
just happened, but I got hurt. I let go of him. Why did I let go of him? That was good. Pick him up.

402
01:15:59,109 --> 01:16:17,300
All right. Good. Momentum. Keep going. Good. Come on. I grappled him. Why did he reverse it?

403
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:28,100
Let go of me. Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go. Why can't I reverse moves?

404
01:16:28,659 --> 01:16:52,380
That's my, that's my move of choice and the spin one. Oh my God. Why? What the fuck?

405
01:16:56,760 --> 01:17:07,640
I need somebody to come interfere for me on my behalf, right? Is he biting me? I hear bites.

406
01:17:12,300 --> 01:17:21,460
I get off of me. Let go of my neck. All right. I'm going to win. I'm going to,

407
01:17:21,460 --> 01:17:32,279
I'm going to do a coward's play here. Is it 10 count? That was pretty good. Double disqualification.

408
01:17:32,279 --> 01:18:03,899
It's the only way I can win. Don't let him get out. Don't let him leave. I win. Oh, oh my God.

409
01:18:06,359 --> 01:18:26,409
Okay. I feel like I don't tap. Don't tap. Don't tap. Don't tap. Don't tap. All right.

410
01:18:26,409 --> 01:18:40,600
I'm not doing that bad considering I started with less health. I got to do some reversals.

411
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:53,350
I think it's just random though. All right. Come here. How did I hurt? How did I hurt my balls?

412
01:18:53,350 --> 01:19:00,329
Jumping. Bat? If I use the bat, I'm going to get disqualified.

413
01:19:00,329 --> 01:19:09,819
God. How does he keep hitting me in the balls? Get up. What the fuck? It's not fair. I started

414
01:19:09,819 --> 01:19:24,140
with half health. Dermot's profile has suffered considerably, considerably after being defeated

415
01:19:24,140 --> 01:19:31,960
so easily. Juan Blunder's progress is being hindered by the limitations of wrestling school.

416
01:19:36,439 --> 01:19:48,069
I'm taking the bat away. I'm literally losing money. Mary Class has defeated Ivy Windsor to

417
01:19:48,069 --> 01:19:59,140
become the new women's champion of Maple Leaf Grappling. Gimmick. Whoa. Why is that? Why am

418
01:19:59,140 --> 01:20:15,289
I losing strength? What was that? That was weird. What was that? Get this prop out of here. Yeah.

419
01:20:15,289 --> 01:20:25,239
No, none. I'm just wasting money. Does this mean training strength? You were losing health to gain

420
01:20:25,239 --> 01:20:36,279
strength. All right. I'm going to go for one more attempt. Proceed. I took the bat off.

421
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:44,600
Whack Axe will visit school on the third week of August to inspire the students.

422
01:20:45,159 --> 01:20:51,500
What the fuck? Danny Might could not be woken from his sleep this morning. The 51-year-old

423
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:59,479
veteran is thought to have died of natural causes. What? What the fuck? The industry will come

424
01:20:59,479 --> 01:21:07,800
together this week to stage a special tribute memory of Danny Might. Nice to meet you,

425
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:14,300
Jerma. We invited you here to discuss working for Rising Sun Fururesu. Is this a new promotion?

426
01:21:15,100 --> 01:21:19,020
You're not exactly a priority for us right now, but we'd consider bringing you in with this deal.

427
01:21:24,810 --> 01:21:34,569
Advance. $200 per week for 32 weeks. No creative control. May not make or refuse any changes. Um,

428
01:21:34,569 --> 01:21:44,550
that seems like that doesn't- that sucks. Wait. I want a- I want $500 a week. I want creative

429
01:21:44,550 --> 01:21:51,539
control. And I want- and I want $2,000 upfront. And I want $800 a week. And I want it for 30- 28

430
01:21:51,539 --> 01:22:00,340
weeks. Who do you think you are to make those demands? You're obviously not taking this very

431
01:22:00,340 --> 01:22:08,890
seriously. I just put it back. Nothing has changed since the last time you proposed that.

432
01:22:08,890 --> 01:22:13,479
You're obviously not willing to compromise. I didn't mean to do that. All right. Well,

433
01:22:13,479 --> 01:22:15,880
obviously not getting anywhere. Let's just forget about it for the time being.

434
01:22:18,359 --> 01:22:24,810
Smoke! Hey, Jerma. I understand you've got a match against Slasher Sweetie tonight.

435
01:22:24,890 --> 01:22:30,569
Shmo- Shmoke Mentor arc? How would you like me to take him out for you? If you give me $130,

436
01:22:30,569 --> 01:22:43,800
I'll make sure he hobbles to the ring. That's- what? No problem. Consider the match won already.

437
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:54,649
Once I'm finished with him, there won't be much left. What is this music? Why is this slow?

438
01:22:55,539 --> 01:23:05,100
This is- wait, guys. This is my time, but it's slowed down. Why is this happening?

439
01:23:12,380 --> 01:23:18,729
Okay, here we go. Proceed. Singles match. Oh, we got a crowd this time.

440
01:23:19,289 --> 01:23:33,239
Jerma! And with Coach Emerson. Why is he coming out here? Why does the referee have a mask on

441
01:23:33,239 --> 01:23:46,939
and a bat? Waving to the fans. Slasher Sweetie with Lance Monaco. He's all fucked up, but he

442
01:23:46,939 --> 01:23:57,380
has a microphone too. I just tried to throw the microphone at him. I just threw the microphone

443
01:23:57,380 --> 01:24:11,399
at him. Fuck, I fell. Who's giving- did he give him the finger to who? This show is dedicated

444
01:24:11,399 --> 01:24:16,180
to the memory of Danny Might, who recently passed away. What the fuck? Get away from me.

445
01:24:16,180 --> 01:24:20,840
Danny Might's work in this ring meant a lot to fans, but the person he was backstage meant

446
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:27,659
even more to us. Who am I talking to? He lived for his family, and through them he lives on.

447
01:24:27,659 --> 01:24:34,300
We hope the donations from this show bring them comfort. Oh wait, this is- oh, that's enough

448
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:38,140
talking. Danny Might is sitting up there waiting for his show, so let's give him one. Did I like

449
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:52,649
sabotage this guy on a charity event? Are you fucking kidding me? This guy's not

450
01:24:52,649 --> 01:25:20,090
getting up. Get the fuck out of here. Oh yeah, eat this! Wait, what? What the fuck? I can hurt

451
01:25:20,090 --> 01:25:50,170
the people and I can hurt these people? Wait, why? What? Where is he? Oh shit, he got up.

452
01:25:51,350 --> 01:25:59,659
Actually, I don't know if you could like attack the commentators. He's gaining health. All right,

453
01:25:59,659 --> 01:26:02,140
no no, no more fucking around. I'm gonna beat this. I'm gonna beat it. I'm gonna- here we go.

454
01:26:19,699 --> 01:26:37,500
I can't. I can't play this. This is so stupid. I can't. Ow. Why do that? Okay, I gotta settle down.

455
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:50,359
Okay, I just- oh, come here. Just get out. Sit down already. This weird shit just keeps happening. I

456
01:26:50,359 --> 01:27:00,840
can't fucking focus. Why would the referee do that? All right, get up. All right, here we go.

457
01:27:01,399 --> 01:27:11,829
This is it. Tap out. That was a wheeze. All the air just left my body when the referee

458
01:27:11,829 --> 01:27:23,270
used his clothesline. It doesn't make any sense. Why would a referee do that? That's it. What the

459
01:27:23,270 --> 01:27:48,250
fuck? This guy's pissed. That's a pin. Referee, get the fuck over here. Oh my god. Pin! Oh my god.

460
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:59,720
This is it. Oh, he's not gonna get up from that one. It's over. I literally just broke his head.

461
01:27:59,720 --> 01:28:29,800
I smashed his skull. It's over. Got it. He's biting the ref. He's so mad. Slasher Sweeney

462
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:34,279
has damaged the reputation of all American wrestling by failing to win that inter-promotional

463
01:28:34,279 --> 01:28:45,350
contest. Irma's profile has improved considerably by winning at a major event. Lance Monaco is

464
01:28:45,350 --> 01:28:53,619
disappointed that his client lost that match. All right. Holy shit, do I get some of that?

465
01:28:53,619 --> 01:29:07,739
$450,000. I only get a hundred bucks. I don't get any money. I didn't get anything. Oh, that was

466
01:29:07,739 --> 01:29:12,460
right. Right. Never mind. All right. I'm sorry. I forgot that was a charity event. I'm sorry.

467
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:26,020
I forgot. Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. Midwinter and Monica Marquez have defeated Major

468
01:29:26,020 --> 01:29:30,979
Merc and Sergeant Acer to become the new Tag Team Champions of Wrestling Revolution.

469
01:29:30,979 --> 01:29:37,510
Lestat McCabray has defeated Helix to become the new Intercontinental Champion of the Federation.

470
01:29:37,510 --> 01:29:46,149
Obby Ball has been appointed as the new Booker of Weekend Warriors. Game of Thrones. Federation

471
01:29:46,149 --> 01:29:49,829
Online have overtaken All American Wrestling to become the most popular brand of wrestling with

472
01:29:49,829 --> 01:30:03,609
a ratings of 89%. All right. 4200 bucks. Why am I bringing pops to the ring? Gimmick. All right,

473
01:30:03,609 --> 01:30:16,460
let's go. Proceed. Singles match. Outback. I need to actually win. Let me actually wrestle and win

474
01:30:16,460 --> 01:30:22,140
a match. I don't have to have it just be total insanity. That guy already has a grenade in his

475
01:30:22,140 --> 01:30:27,899
hand. So I don't know what's going to happen with that. I don't know why he's holding it currently,

476
01:30:27,899 --> 01:30:31,020
but he's looking at the referee. The referee's leaving the ring.

477
01:30:31,979 --> 01:30:52,039
Do you still have it? I ain't going in there. He's holding two. He's going to videotape himself.

478
01:30:52,039 --> 01:31:09,130
What? What is going on? What's wrong with this guy? Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this singles

479
01:31:09,130 --> 01:31:22,260
match. Weighing in at 170 pounds and standing at five foot eight, first welcome Jerma. Weighing 254,

480
01:31:22,260 --> 01:31:30,170
511 is Outback. Holding a cartoon stick of dynamite and a camera. Let's ring the bell and find

481
01:31:30,170 --> 01:31:46,329
ourselves a winner. Uh-huh. Can I get that out of the ring? I'm trying to get it. I don't want

482
01:31:46,329 --> 01:32:01,239
to have it be in the ring. All right, here we go. Evenly matched, except he's got 60 pounds on me.

483
01:32:01,239 --> 01:32:26,300
Oh, Jesus. Fuck. Is it a dud? I don't think it is. All right, I gotta fucking wrestle and do this the

484
01:32:26,300 --> 01:32:43,939
way that I do. There we are. That was a big move. Nice. Why is he? He just baited me. That was

485
01:32:43,939 --> 01:33:01,159
fucking ridiculous. He just caught my arm. All right, step on his head. Wrench it. This is doing

486
01:33:01,159 --> 01:33:19,060
damage. Oh my God. That was a bad place to be. All right, more. I'm going to throw him against

487
01:33:19,060 --> 01:33:41,909
ropes, but that was nice. Good job. Monkey flip. Perfect. Good execution. Oh, he blocked it. Shit.

488
01:33:41,909 --> 01:34:05,619
Sorry. Rope break. Oh, fuck you. Still evenly matched. It's fine. Test of strength. I don't

489
01:34:05,619 --> 01:34:19,300
know. I don't have no idea how to win. He just raffled. He did a goofy scream.

490
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:42,250
Holy shit. What did I just do to him? How do I do that again? Get out of here. Get that shit out of

491
01:34:42,250 --> 01:34:51,720
here. Oops. Sorry, he didn't see it. Move out of the way, ref. I'm trying to fucking work here.

492
01:34:51,720 --> 01:35:12,420
Goodbye. All right, I got the hang of this now. Oops. I almost have my finisher. I gotta build up

493
01:35:12,420 --> 01:35:23,979
my finisher and actually do it. That hurts. Watch out. Run away. Just get away. Get away. Get away.

494
01:35:23,979 --> 01:35:36,149
Get away. Get away. Get away. Get away. Get away. Get away. Get away. Get away. Watch it. Where are

495
01:35:36,149 --> 01:35:44,180
you going? Are you fucking kidding me? That was a good move. I grabbed his ass and I spun him

496
01:35:44,180 --> 01:36:14,039
around. How is this guy doing this? It doesn't make any sense. Get in here. All right. I just

497
01:36:14,039 --> 01:36:27,050
grabbed him. Why is he instantly reversed this shit? There it is. Nice. All right. Good. Good.

498
01:36:27,050 --> 01:36:39,640
Keep it going. It's because he's stronger than you. Get out of the way, ref. Why would you stand in

499
01:36:39,640 --> 01:37:05,420
the way? Good. All right. I still have the upper hand. I'm fine. Good. Grab him by the head. I gotta

500
01:37:05,420 --> 01:37:14,520
grab him. I gotta get him in the middle of the ring. Where's he going? Come here. Where'd he go?

501
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:24,680
What the fuck are you doing? I have no idea what just happened, but I just fucked him up bad.

502
01:37:24,680 --> 01:37:41,239
Watch out for the bomb. I'm not touching that. Damn it. Oh, that was worth a lot of points.

503
01:37:41,239 --> 01:37:53,720
Let me try that again. Oh, here we go. There's no rope here. I might get him to tap. There's no

504
01:37:53,720 --> 01:38:03,619
rope in sight. He's got low health. This is over. That's my special. It's almost there. Oh, we're

505
01:38:03,619 --> 01:38:18,180
gonna get to see the stunner. Come on. Tap out. Am I even putting pressure on him? What's going on?

506
01:38:18,739 --> 01:38:26,439
I feel like this guy's just letting me do this and just taking a breather for a few minutes.

507
01:38:26,439 --> 01:38:30,680
This does not hurt him at all. And he's just like, thank God this guy, this this wuss thinks he's

508
01:38:30,680 --> 01:38:40,539
hurting me. I can breathe for like five minutes. Rip his arm out of his socket. Oh my God.

509
01:38:42,170 --> 01:38:58,020
Why did I lose special for that? Yes. Here we go. It's over. It's time for the stunner.

510
01:38:59,399 --> 01:39:07,560
Good night. Game over. That's a popularity boost right there.

511
01:39:08,119 --> 01:39:24,300
Is this illegal? Why did I lose skill? Nerma's profile has improved considerably by winning

512
01:39:24,300 --> 01:39:29,340
so convincingly. Outback's profile has suffered considerably after being defeated so easily.

513
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:37,350
All right. There was a lot of people in the attendance. Oh, what? I'm just bleeding money.

514
01:39:38,310 --> 01:39:41,189
Where's this hundred dollars of expenses coming from? Anybody know?

515
01:39:44,439 --> 01:39:54,119
It's the training. All American Wrestling product has come under criticism in recent weeks with

516
01:39:54,119 --> 01:40:01,239
ratings down to 85 percent. A new women's champion, Nervana's defeated comic Connie.

517
01:40:02,949 --> 01:40:08,619
Oh, Nerma, aren't you tired of pouring your energy into working out for such small gains?

518
01:40:09,340 --> 01:40:15,100
For just a hundred and twenty dollars, I could hook you up with some steroids.

519
01:40:15,100 --> 01:40:33,939
It will give you big results. Fast. Um, do I get, do I get caught? You'll feel the results in no time.

520
01:40:33,939 --> 01:40:42,390
Holy shit, it worked. Four man elimination versus multiple opponents in this one.

521
01:40:51,720 --> 01:41:13,239
Needles. I love how they just put tables out there even when it's not a hardcore match.

522
01:41:13,239 --> 01:41:30,470
Driver 88. You did steroids and you're versus needles. Yeah. So are we all in the ring at the

523
01:41:30,470 --> 01:42:09,000
same time? How long can my entrance be? This is so stupid. Can I go into the audience?

524
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:36,840
I'm like signing autographs. All right, I'm in. Oh, you want to give me the finger?

525
01:42:36,840 --> 01:42:45,750
And the final contestant is Black Axe with Matt Dickey. Wait, the dev is here?

526
01:42:46,470 --> 01:42:50,869
This guy must be a big deal. The dev is, is literally this guy's manager.

527
01:42:51,590 --> 01:43:02,329
Who should I focus on? Black Axe, you only remain the world champion this long by ducking me.

528
01:43:02,970 --> 01:43:13,079
Everybody knows that I'm the biggest threat to that little title. My mouth. Ow, my face.

529
01:43:13,079 --> 01:43:31,909
Please. Now I'll show you why you were right to fear me. Okay. My manager is always just in here.

530
01:43:32,630 --> 01:43:37,989
All right. So this is the, why do I? All right. Here's the play. The play is to get out of the,

531
01:43:37,989 --> 01:43:41,430
just run away and have these guys fight each other and kill each other. And I come in.

532
01:43:42,069 --> 01:43:46,789
It's like the scavenger as the vulture. Just pin the last suspecting person.

533
01:43:51,300 --> 01:43:57,739
Oops. Watch that. Watch that. Watch that. All right. I'm going to focus on,

534
01:43:58,460 --> 01:44:04,979
why don't we all just gang up on Whack Axe? He's the champion. It's just carnage over there.

535
01:44:04,979 --> 01:44:11,289
What if I take the belt? I'm going to grab the belt and just like leave. I got it.

536
01:44:15,020 --> 01:44:36,659
All right. Fine. I'll put it down. I got to focus on this guy. Oh my God. How is anybody supposed

537
01:44:36,659 --> 01:44:50,060
to get pinned in this? Right in the face. I have to wait till they get to my level. But I, I'm

538
01:44:50,060 --> 01:44:53,979
going to do what I used to do in no mercy. Just stand in the corner and taunt until I have a

539
01:44:53,979 --> 01:44:59,529
special and use my special on like the lowest guy. This taunt builds your special. If it works

540
01:44:59,529 --> 01:45:04,840
like no mercy, it does very briefly. And they're getting pissed that I'm doing that. All right.

541
01:45:04,840 --> 01:45:24,180
This guy right here. Get out of here M. Dickie. I have such a low health. It's not even funny.

542
01:45:24,739 --> 01:45:44,460
Distracted by the chair. Idiot. You know what? Get. All right. Come on in. Get in. Get in. Get

543
01:45:44,460 --> 01:45:51,859
in. He's not paying attention. All right. Do something stupid. Hurt him. How did I let him

544
01:45:51,859 --> 01:45:56,020
do that? I tried to grab him and he grabbed me by the head. It's cause I'm so weak. I even did

545
01:45:56,020 --> 01:46:08,539
steroids before this match. It didn't even matter. I did steroids an hour ago. Here we go. Nice.

546
01:46:10,329 --> 01:46:19,670
Black Axe. Austin crab this motherfucker right now. You two fight each other.

547
01:46:22,420 --> 01:46:29,050
I, I pinned him. No, I eliminated him. What? What's happening right now? Why is he not like.

548
01:46:35,210 --> 01:46:37,930
Like he's out. He's eliminated. Get him out of here.

549
01:46:38,569 --> 01:46:57,029
I just know I eliminated his ass. Get him out. Come on. All right. Don't get eliminated. Run

550
01:46:57,029 --> 01:47:07,289
away. Run away. Let them fight. Grab him from behind. There we go. Nice. All right. Don't pay

551
01:47:07,289 --> 01:47:25,189
attention to me. You focus on each other. Good. Just I'm just a person in the audience. Don't

552
01:47:25,189 --> 01:47:55,189
mind me. I'm going to get a special. I'm going to use it. Oh, does this make me more popular

553
01:47:55,189 --> 01:48:07,699
if I play to the crowd? Holy shit. Sneak, sneak, sneak, sneak out, sneak out, sneak out, sneak out.

554
01:48:07,699 --> 01:48:27,449
Oh shit. I'm trying to run away. Come on. Get away. Oh my head. Now I'm getting just double

555
01:48:27,449 --> 01:48:38,890
teamed. This is bad. He was holding my arms back. Why is he taking his chair? He just. Why? My

556
01:48:38,890 --> 01:48:46,229
coach just literally took the chair that the commentator was sitting on. Why? What's wrong

557
01:48:46,229 --> 01:49:03,619
with you? The commentator is now coming into the ring. Like what are you doing out here?

558
01:49:05,449 --> 01:49:21,899
This is who is this? Tony Land. All right. I'm going to stop this guy. No. Reverse it, please.

559
01:49:25,750 --> 01:49:43,739
That's fine. Pin him. I could care less. That took me so long to get up. That's fine. Kick his ass.

560
01:49:44,619 --> 01:49:54,119
What is he doing? Okay. That guy just got fired and he just doesn't care. Check this out. Stunner.

561
01:49:54,920 --> 01:50:25,220
Come here. Come here. Stunner. Pin him. No longer the champion. He's gone. Oh, there's no ref. I'm

562
01:50:25,220 --> 01:50:36,340
fine. I hope he fights the commentator. I don't know what the ref is doing. I have no idea. Thank

563
01:50:36,340 --> 01:50:48,810
God. Coach. What's his name? Coach Emerson. I think this is going to be a win. Am I going to be the

564
01:50:48,810 --> 01:51:05,689
champion after this? Referee is not looking. Referee is not paying attention. Oh shit. Test

565
01:51:05,689 --> 01:51:21,430
of strength. Let's go. Oh, he's so much stronger than me. No. I'm so much weaker than him. What the

566
01:51:21,430 --> 01:51:51,289
fuck? Get up. Get up. Let go of me. Fuck. Nope. Not going to happen. Wait till he gets up. Oh my God.

567
01:51:51,289 --> 01:52:16,340
There it is. Going top rope. Oh my God. Oh no. Oh, that sucked. Don't let him knock you down. Good.

568
01:52:16,340 --> 01:52:38,060
All right. We got it. I'm going for a submission again. He's done. Don't coach. Don't screw this

569
01:52:38,060 --> 01:52:44,680
up for me. This is really close. I don't know what just happened there, but apparently not

570
01:52:44,680 --> 01:52:53,380
something good. Get up. I'm so dazed right now. I'm just going to hang out out here until I get

571
01:52:53,380 --> 01:53:06,659
my breath. Am I all right? I think I'm okay. I'm going back in. Whatever. I don't care if I

572
01:53:06,659 --> 01:53:17,460
hurt the ref. Did I just hurt my own shoulder? Oh fuck you. No way. Get off me. Reverse it. Reverse

573
01:53:17,460 --> 01:53:29,609
it. Reverse it. Reverse it. Reverse it. Rope break. I'm so slow to get up. I'm so weak. Oh no.

574
01:53:29,609 --> 01:53:44,739
Good. Breather. Take a breather. Take a breather. Take a breather. All right. I'm fine. That was

575
01:53:44,739 --> 01:54:01,180
huge. I just got to get up. Take a breather still. I grabbed him and he did a move to me. Oh, that's

576
01:54:01,180 --> 01:54:17,539
bad. Just stay in the ropes and I'll be fine. Did he help me? Is he helping me or hurting me?

577
01:54:17,619 --> 01:54:31,909
Was that a hindrance? I'm so weak. I can barely stand up. I'm just gonna have to use body weight.

578
01:54:31,909 --> 01:54:45,699
Hit him. Oh, come on, dude. Again. What? I was gonna say no way. Reverse it. Reverse it, please.

579
01:54:46,729 --> 01:55:04,779
Reverse it. He's holding me for way too long. Oh, come on. What's that guy's name? Schmo? Oh,

580
01:55:04,779 --> 01:55:23,880
you're fucked now. What the hell did I let go for? Come on. Get in here. Get in here. Oh god,

581
01:55:23,880 --> 01:55:32,380
he elbowed me and I fell down. I don't think I'm gonna win this match. I think it's over. No,

582
01:55:32,380 --> 01:55:40,470
he's down too. I gotta run. I gotta escape. It's so close. I know. I gotta run away for a minute.

583
01:55:40,470 --> 01:55:58,100
Take a breather. Good. The bait worked. Holy shit. I actually just fooled him.

584
01:55:58,100 --> 01:56:14,550
Damn it. I missed. Oh, come on. Hurt him. That's it. No, it's not. Look at how much

585
01:56:14,550 --> 01:56:29,590
slow I am to get up. I'm trying to get up so fast. Come here, you piece of shit. No. No. Fight it.

586
01:56:29,590 --> 01:56:37,609
Don't let him beat you. No, he's got me even worse. Oh no, this is horrible. This is

587
01:56:37,609 --> 01:56:46,220
horrible. I'm passed out right now. I'm dead. I'm not responsive. Good.

588
01:56:55,689 --> 01:57:22,939
I can't do this. Boom. Shit. Come on. Get up. Get up, please. You're doing such a good job

589
01:57:22,939 --> 01:57:30,539
distracting for me. I'm not getting up. It's over. I'm at zero. I'm actually at zero health.

590
01:57:33,060 --> 01:57:42,140
I have to slide out of the ring if I have any chance. Get up. Come on. Coward move. Out. Roll

591
01:57:42,140 --> 01:57:56,069
out. Oh my fucking God. Why did I do that? Come on, coach. Coach, you're really getting in the way,

592
01:57:56,069 --> 01:58:28,170
man. That's it. That's it. One, two. Yes. Get out of here. Oh, that was insane. I can't believe it.

593
01:58:30,460 --> 01:58:36,300
Wackax appears to have been sustained by adrenaline in that match and is suffering from exhaustion

594
01:58:36,300 --> 01:58:45,189
now that it's over. Okay. Dermis profile has improved considerably by winning at a major event.

595
01:58:45,909 --> 01:58:49,750
Driver 88's strength has risen to 76% after participating in that match.

596
01:58:51,189 --> 01:58:55,510
Needles has damaged the reputation of Wrestling Revolution by failing to win that inter-promotional

597
01:58:55,510 --> 01:59:09,739
contest. Why not get any money? I have to get signed. All right. Come on. Sign me. I got a match

598
01:59:09,739 --> 01:59:18,220
coming up that I'm not sure I can win on my own. Okay. Would you consider assisting me at the ring

599
01:59:18,220 --> 01:59:27,979
side? There's $60 in it for you if you do. 60 bucks, man. Let's go. Sure. I was going to come out

600
01:59:27,979 --> 01:59:43,430
and protect him. I paid $130 for mine. I'll just make sure that he doesn't lose. I got Matt Black

601
01:59:43,430 --> 02:00:08,220
with Jerma. I can't get in the ring, right? Can I get in the ring? Yeah. And then Burlain with

602
02:00:08,220 --> 02:00:29,399
Matt Dickey. Oh, it's manager versus manager time. Can I get in? I think I just punched him. Do I have

603
02:00:29,399 --> 02:00:36,060
to get out? So it's okay. The guy with the bald head. Wait, there's two guys with bald head. Where

604
02:00:36,060 --> 02:00:43,699
am I? Wait, what's wrong with my character? Matt Dickey, I think. I didn't press any buttons. I'm

605
02:00:43,699 --> 02:00:47,829
pretty sure Matt Dickey just fell off the ring. I did not press any buttons. I don't even know where

606
02:00:47,829 --> 02:01:02,680
I am. Where the fuck am I? Where am I? I can't see myself. This is their match. Yeah. I got to make

607
02:01:02,680 --> 02:01:42,439
sure he wins. Are we under the ring? Where are we fighting? Okay. Holy shit. This is awesome.

608
02:01:44,659 --> 02:01:58,890
Where are we? Where the fuck did we go? Oh my god. That was cool from here. All right. Where are we?

609
02:01:59,930 --> 02:02:30,899
Oh shit. There I am. My stomach. I'm here. I made it. Okay. Let's change the camera back to normal.

610
02:02:30,899 --> 02:02:39,909
What was it called? Hard camera? What was it? Like 70, 80 percent? 60? How much percent zoom was it?

611
02:02:40,470 --> 02:02:52,920
I don't even know what I have no idea what the actual camera was. All right. I'm coming in.

612
02:02:52,920 --> 02:03:05,609
How do I go in? I think I fell down again. Where's Matt Dickey? How come I can't go in

613
02:03:05,609 --> 02:03:17,500
the ring? Oh shit. Look at he's almost dead. Okay. Can I throw a weapon in the ring and hit him?

614
02:03:17,500 --> 02:03:26,140
Well, what do I care if I get disqualified? That doesn't matter, right? Does that matter

615
02:03:26,140 --> 02:03:50,970
if I get disqualified? Did I hit the ref? Come on. I got you. Oops. I'm picking up the stairs.

616
02:03:52,539 --> 02:04:08,310
Here. I'll pass it to you. Right on the chair. And that was legal because he didn't do anything.

617
02:04:08,310 --> 02:04:27,300
Hit him. Let's go. Hit him. Hey, get down. Get down. Get him down. Get him down. Yeah. I'm not in.

618
02:04:27,300 --> 02:04:34,779
I'm not in there. This is not illegal for me. All right. Fuck it. I'm going in. Get this motherfucker.

619
02:04:34,779 --> 02:05:02,600
Get him. Shit. Get in. Fuck. Oh my god. He landed on top of me. Put that down. Put that down. Put.

620
02:05:02,600 --> 02:05:13,479
Good. Good. Good. Good. All right. Let's kick his ass. Ow. Sorry. All right. This guy's really

621
02:05:13,479 --> 02:05:23,000
injured. All right. I got him. Get in the ring. Get in the ring. Get in the ring. You're fine.

622
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:26,439
Put the bat down and get in the ring. I got it. I got this.

623
02:05:26,439 --> 02:05:46,939
Why is this guy on permanent two count? Change it to scope? Oh, scope. Player only? Relevant to

624
02:05:46,939 --> 02:05:57,609
player? Is this relevant to player or contain all? Which one should I do? Player only, right?

625
02:05:57,609 --> 02:06:15,640
I don't think that matters. Why am I tired? Count him out. I have no idea where M. Dickie is,

626
02:06:15,640 --> 02:06:22,949
but he's like, I think he's on the ground somewhere. Don't get yourself counted out. Let

627
02:06:22,949 --> 02:06:46,060
him get counted out. You idiot. Come here. I gotta go find M. Dickie. All right. Camera.

628
02:06:47,460 --> 02:06:54,180
Bird's eye third person. The third person contain all? No, that's only covering these guys.

629
02:07:05,619 --> 02:07:35,899
He's on the rope. I'm trying to grab the ref. It's like a superhero jump. All right. Pin him.

630
02:07:35,899 --> 02:07:44,810
Oh, there's M. Dickie. What are you doing? Why would you just do that? That's a rope break.

631
02:07:44,810 --> 02:07:50,579
All right. Get him down here. This camera. Fuck. Contain all. There we go.

632
02:08:09,539 --> 02:08:27,579
Hey, what are you guys thinking about the match so far? Who's getting counted out?

633
02:08:27,579 --> 02:08:36,310
I don't know who's getting counted out. I think it's this guy. Are we about to win? What's

634
02:08:36,310 --> 02:08:44,579
happening? Count him out. Yeah. I don't know why you were refereeing this match outlaw eaten

635
02:08:44,579 --> 02:08:53,340
because you're obviously not qualified. I can't play this game. I'm going to do that every 10

636
02:08:53,340 --> 02:09:03,819
seconds. It's the biggest mistake of your life. I have to relax. Every time I see something stupid,

637
02:09:03,819 --> 02:09:15,609
I just like all the air leaves my body. Oh, this is not the game to play. I have to pull

638
02:09:15,609 --> 02:09:24,619
with a muscle in my neck. God damn it, man. All right. I got to settle down. Relay his damage,

639
02:09:24,619 --> 02:09:30,060
the reputation of wrestling revolution by failing to win. Matt Black's profile has improved. Okay.

640
02:09:32,300 --> 02:09:42,789
Matt Dickie is disappointed that his client lost that match. Oh my goodness. People paid

641
02:09:42,789 --> 02:09:51,420
money to watch that match. Yeah. I think that's worth like five times what the WWE pay reviews

642
02:09:51,420 --> 02:10:00,329
are. That was insane. Dangal has developed a friendship with Buddy Brew. Oh wait, this is

643
02:10:00,329 --> 02:10:05,369
Matt Black. Bully Demise walks around like he owns this place and has been making our lives miserable.

644
02:10:05,369 --> 02:10:13,800
Do you think you could teach him a lesson? There's $80 in it for you if you do. Teach him a lesson.

645
02:10:15,960 --> 02:10:27,300
Um, why am I this guy's lackey? I don't think I can do... All right. I'll deal with Bully Demise.

646
02:10:27,300 --> 02:10:37,880
Do I... Can I bring a weapon? I don't have any... I can't. I don't have any health. I need a week of

647
02:10:37,880 --> 02:10:46,920
rest. You're not part of the solution. You're part of the problem, Jerma. No. What the fuck?

648
02:10:49,159 --> 02:11:02,220
All right. This is I think big match coming up here. What am I doing? 75, 76, 72, 60. All right.

649
02:11:07,930 --> 02:11:19,420
Sumo contest. What does that mean? Call me Hawk. Oh, by the way, for those of you that are curious,

650
02:11:19,739 --> 02:11:23,979
I recognize this name because I think I went into the editor just to check and see what it was like

651
02:11:23,979 --> 02:11:28,300
and I think I changed his hair. I don't think he looks like this. Like the default character.

652
02:11:33,050 --> 02:11:52,600
What does sumo match? All right. For a second, I thought that was Tony Batagor.

653
02:11:57,060 --> 02:12:06,659
I don't understand what a sumo match means. Just throw him over the ropes? What are you doing,

654
02:12:06,659 --> 02:12:21,909
ref? What's wrong with you? Don't leave the ring. Okay. Five minutes? This guy is like seven or

655
02:12:21,909 --> 02:12:29,909
eight. That guy's like two feet taller than me. Lance Monaco is coming in. For who? Me? No,

656
02:12:29,909 --> 02:12:56,039
this guy's a dick. This guy, I don't... Get him out of here. Did I just lose? Come on. What? What

657
02:12:56,039 --> 02:13:08,680
the fuck? Why did that guy interfere? That's not fair. Tommy Hawk's profile has improved considerably

658
02:13:08,680 --> 02:13:13,800
by having a guy interfere, walk in the ring, and then I bounce off of his body and fly over the

659
02:13:13,800 --> 02:13:27,640
ropes. Oh, he generated buzz. Lance Monaco is so popular. What the hell? The doper is complaining

660
02:13:27,640 --> 02:13:32,630
about cheating. Running short of staff tonight, Jerma. Could you sit in on commentary for the

661
02:13:32,630 --> 02:13:42,920
next match? Oh, hell yeah. Yes. Oh, absolutely. I will work as a commentator. This is awesome.

662
02:13:42,920 --> 02:13:50,729
Thanks, Jerma. You just saved the broadcast. Please accept $60 for your time. What do I do?

663
02:13:51,619 --> 02:14:10,890
It's another sumo contest. John Crockett. That's John Crockett versus in a sumo. I thought he

664
02:14:10,890 --> 02:14:19,829
just eliminated himself. Versus Wurikusan with Coach Emerson. Okay, same rules. If you go over

665
02:14:19,829 --> 02:14:31,689
the top rope, you're out. Very cool. So, I am sitting over there. Do I have to... What do I

666
02:14:31,689 --> 02:14:38,010
have to do? I'm just the commentator? Jerma will be joining us on commentary to share his insights

667
02:14:38,010 --> 02:14:45,500
in this match. This is awesome. You know what it takes to win. So, how long do you see this match

668
02:14:45,500 --> 02:14:53,560
going? It will go longer than five minutes. It will take less than five minutes. If it's a sumo

669
02:14:53,560 --> 02:14:59,449
competition, someone's going over very quickly. It'll take less than five minutes. You heard it

670
02:14:59,449 --> 02:15:14,649
here first. Jerma thinks this match will be over soon. So, let's find out. Okay. What's this camera?

671
02:15:14,649 --> 02:15:27,140
Wait, what am I... What the fuck? What's happening? What is happening? Why did I... I didn't mean to

672
02:15:27,140 --> 02:15:37,510
climb. What? Do I still have to do commentary? No. Get off. Get off. Get off. Get off. Sit back in

673
02:15:37,510 --> 02:15:45,699
the chair. I got it right. It's over. I got it right. See? The real winner tonight is you, Jerma.

674
02:15:45,699 --> 02:16:09,210
You predicted this match would be quick. That's right. This... Okay. I'm telling you right now.

675
02:16:09,770 --> 02:16:16,729
I'm going to make this very clear. This is some of the... This is some of the most fun

676
02:16:17,449 --> 02:16:24,069
I've had. Just chilling out, playing a video game. I have to be honest with you. It's been a very...

677
02:16:24,069 --> 02:16:33,879
It's been a while. A very long time. This is fucking fantastic. All right. Yeah, that match was 35

678
02:16:33,879 --> 02:16:39,879
seconds long. All right. Their profile suffered considerably after incurring a loss at a major

679
02:16:39,879 --> 02:16:47,319
event. John Crockett's profile has improved. That was so fast. Coach Emerson is disappointed

680
02:16:47,319 --> 02:16:58,139
that his client lost that match. Shmoke's status is being compromised by the limitations of

681
02:16:58,139 --> 02:17:03,909
wrestling school. Kylee Barrier's profile has dropped considerably after being criticized by

682
02:17:03,909 --> 02:17:11,930
the press. What's coming up next? Something on TV? I have actually full health this time, thankfully.

683
02:17:14,420 --> 02:17:25,420
Okay. What do we got next? Last Man Standing versus David Highbrow. All right. Let's make this one

684
02:17:25,420 --> 02:17:56,420
quick. You're going to get signed soon? I hope so. Versus Jerma. What are the rules? Last Man

685
02:17:56,420 --> 02:18:01,739
Standing. Jerma, I'm sure you think winning a fight involves being on top for three precious

686
02:18:01,739 --> 02:18:11,299
seconds. Well, when you win a real fight, the loser doesn't get up ever again. They kill each

687
02:18:11,299 --> 02:18:18,229
other? You're about to find that out when only one of us walks out of here in one piece. Share

688
02:18:18,229 --> 02:18:24,870
him in the face, please. Actually, the three counters there protect my victims. There'll be

689
02:18:24,870 --> 02:18:34,870
no mercy for you now. Oh, there are no rules? How does she have the chair? Is there no rules?

690
02:18:35,510 --> 02:19:00,649
All right. There are obviously no rules. Obviously no rules. Going to get weapons. Oh my god.

691
02:19:01,129 --> 02:19:24,629
Holy shit. That was brutal. Oh, I got to get the table in here. This guy had a lot, talked a lot

692
02:19:24,629 --> 02:19:37,819
of talk. Holy shit. Okay. I got to get him through the table. Get the table in here. I'm going to

693
02:19:37,819 --> 02:19:52,629
pile drive him through the table. Come over here. Are you man enough to come over here and get on

694
02:19:52,629 --> 02:20:06,840
the table? What do you think? Come on over here. Why don't you come face me on the table? Face me

695
02:20:06,840 --> 02:20:19,270
on the table. Face me on the table, coward. Fine. I'll just put you on the table. Get down here.

696
02:20:19,270 --> 02:20:31,540
I just punched the thing. All right. Get over here. Give me the shit. Ow. Bring the table into

697
02:20:31,540 --> 02:20:47,799
the ring. Who does a submission move in like a weapons match? Quest it. I think the ref just

698
02:20:47,799 --> 02:21:06,409
bit her lip. Oh my god. He caught me. Why does she care? Excuse me. Fight it. There we go. All right.

699
02:21:06,409 --> 02:21:14,819
Break his neck. The goal is to get the table in the ring, get him on the table and to do a back

700
02:21:14,819 --> 02:21:26,010
flip on him through the table. I think it has really hurt him. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

701
02:21:26,010 --> 02:21:36,940
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Shit. No. Come on. That was stupid.

702
02:21:38,219 --> 02:22:05,129
Can I sit him in the chair? What's the count for? Wait, what's going on? All right. Can I put him

703
02:22:05,129 --> 02:22:18,200
in the chair? All right. I'm going to put him through the chair. He has to stay on the ground

704
02:22:18,200 --> 02:22:34,200
for 10 seconds. Oh, okay. I get it. Fight it. He just punched me in the balls. All right. Yeah.

705
02:22:34,200 --> 02:22:46,489
Whatever. Last man standing. Fine. And you're going to go there? Oh, there's an announcer's table

706
02:22:46,489 --> 02:23:21,139
over there. Oh, you're down. See you later. I'm not going to let him get up. Stop the match. Hey,

707
02:23:21,139 --> 02:23:57,799
down. This guy's, this is horrible. Out. No. He was baiting me. Did you see that? That was a,

708
02:23:57,799 --> 02:24:05,239
that was a fake. I'm going to get the other, I'm getting the announcer's table and put it in here.

709
02:24:05,239 --> 02:24:29,860
Give me, is he down? Did I win? I won. I killed him. I win. His profile has improved considerably.

710
02:24:29,860 --> 02:24:43,780
Nice. All right. 78 attitude. David Highbrows is way down. I need to get signed by an actual company

711
02:24:43,780 --> 02:24:55,510
so I can start bleeding money. While Eaton and and all Cobain have defeated Midwinter and Monica

712
02:24:55,510 --> 02:25:02,809
Marquez to become the new tag team champions. The ball has defeated Lestat Macabre. I want to

713
02:25:02,809 --> 02:25:09,909
be a champion. All right. This is it. I've been keeping an eye on your progress and think some

714
02:25:09,909 --> 02:25:17,379
changes need to be made. I need an agency, right? You're not talented enough to give fans the

715
02:25:17,379 --> 02:25:25,979
technical wrestling that they pay to see. What? Get your scale up to 79% by the second week of

716
02:25:25,979 --> 02:25:32,680
October or you'll have to find a different line of work. What? Oh God, what's going on?

717
02:25:33,239 --> 02:25:36,600
Jeremiah, aren't you tired of pouring your energy into working out for such small gains?

718
02:25:37,319 --> 02:25:44,389
For just $120, I could hook you up with some steroids so that I give you big results. I

719
02:25:44,389 --> 02:25:57,399
immediately, immediately after hearing that went to the drug dealer. Okay. What are my stats? 79%

720
02:25:57,399 --> 02:26:31,049
right? My scale is 80. I'm good. We're good. All right. This is a regular match. I think I have a

721
02:26:31,049 --> 02:26:45,239
club. Oh no. Tommy Hawk. I got a rivalry with this guy. This is just a singles match. All right. I

722
02:26:45,239 --> 02:26:51,290
have to beat this guy. I got to just do technical wrestling, beat him, actually play by the rules

723
02:26:51,290 --> 02:27:01,209
and just win. Lock the medicine cabinet. Jerma is on the prowl looking for his next fix. That's

724
02:27:01,209 --> 02:27:07,590
unconfirmed. Cat's out of the bag and now everybody knows you're a filthy drug addict. That hasn't

725
02:27:07,590 --> 02:27:12,889
been confirmed. You brought shame on this sport and everybody who has tried to keep it clean.

726
02:27:12,889 --> 02:27:20,700
I'm just so sure about that. Why don't you give us a urine sample, Tommy Hawk?

727
02:27:25,340 --> 02:27:29,020
After I beat the piss out of you, the whole world would get to see who you really are.

728
02:27:29,020 --> 02:27:32,459
I have to win this. Otherwise I have to do a drug test. I think that's what,

729
02:27:32,459 --> 02:27:55,079
I think that's what this is implying. Start. Good start. All right. I got to focus here.

730
02:28:00,760 --> 02:28:08,500
Focus, focus. I don't, I don't know what just happened. Thank you. Ref just helped me

731
02:28:09,459 --> 02:28:20,389
accidentally. I have to do really light moves on this guy because I can't lift him. I really

732
02:28:20,389 --> 02:28:32,420
don't think I can lift him up. Nice. Holy shit. What a perfect event. That was unbelievable.

733
02:28:32,420 --> 02:28:48,170
I almost have my special. A couple more of those and I'm going to put them up.

734
02:28:48,170 --> 02:29:07,479
Good. Good. Do it. Use it. Idiot. Oh, the fucking reversal. The double reversal. Shit.

735
02:29:08,280 --> 02:29:17,819
Test of strength. I really am on steroids. Come on. This is it. This is where I can end it. I can

736
02:29:17,819 --> 02:29:22,540
end it right here if I get an adrenaline rush here. I got it. It's over. Stunner. Good night.

737
02:29:23,100 --> 02:29:51,639
Pick him up and do it again. Quick. Good night. That's it. Oh, nice try. Don't get too cocky.

738
02:29:51,639 --> 02:30:02,579
If he wants to leave, let him leave. How did I miss that? How did I miss that? How the fuck

739
02:30:02,579 --> 02:30:13,940
did I miss that? I went right through him. What the fuck? He's hurt. He's actually hurt.

740
02:30:13,940 --> 02:30:22,739
I was holding his side pretty hard. If I didn't start with 50% health. God damn it. All right.

741
02:30:22,739 --> 02:30:34,309
I'm fine. I'm fine. Just relax. Actually exactly where I want to be. Go up. Take the time to gain

742
02:30:34,309 --> 02:30:57,750
some strength here. Relax. All right. Bring it back. Step on his head. Don't let him grab me.

743
02:30:57,750 --> 02:31:09,590
That's all I need to know. Watch out. Do some dodging. That was an eye rake if I've ever seen

744
02:31:09,590 --> 02:31:41,819
one. Oh, get out of here. Here we go. And shit. Move. Consume his fist to gain power. No. Just run

745
02:31:41,819 --> 02:31:53,450
away. Run away. I'm slowly whittling him down to my level. That was a really good move. Oh,

746
02:31:53,450 --> 02:32:09,110
come on. Break that rope, please. Again, rope break. Oops. Well, it worked out in my favor.

747
02:32:09,110 --> 02:32:27,450
It's okay. Watch that return. I don't want him to kick me. All right. Come on. He's getting low.

748
02:32:31,899 --> 02:32:53,530
Fuck. What? Oh, that cheap little bullshit. Oh, oh, I'm so good. Use it. Use it. Use it on me.

749
02:32:53,530 --> 02:33:06,090
Use it on me. Use it on me. Use it on me. Oh, god damn it. Get him with a submission. I gotta

750
02:33:06,090 --> 02:33:32,709
get him on the ground. Got it. Got it. Oh, fuck. Again, on his head. Break the arm. Break the arm.

751
02:33:32,709 --> 02:33:46,739
Twist it. Come on. Hurt him. I don't want to get a drug test. Do it. Do it. I don't want to take a

752
02:33:46,739 --> 02:34:07,139
drug test. Twist it. Come on. No. Oh, he's so close. This referee's crotch. Tap out. That's it.

753
02:34:08,280 --> 02:34:25,379
Yeah. Tommy Hawk's skill has risen to 66%. The ref was just listening to that.

754
02:34:27,450 --> 02:34:38,809
All right. More stamina. Imagine being the ref and hearing that. What the fuck am I listening to?

755
02:34:39,450 --> 02:34:47,190
I don't want to take a drug test. No. I have to win. Tap out. I don't want to take a drug test.

756
02:34:47,190 --> 02:34:51,190
Birdboy has left All-American Wrestling to pursue a career at Super Lucha Libre.

757
02:34:51,190 --> 02:35:07,739
Jerma appears to have gained weight. The 35-year-old now weighs 247 pounds.

758
02:35:09,909 --> 02:35:14,819
My skill went down. Jerma has been challenged to increase his skill to 79%

759
02:35:14,819 --> 02:35:31,020
by the second week of October. Oh my God. How do I lose weight? I can go train. Oh,

760
02:35:31,020 --> 02:35:37,129
my health is so low. All right. How do I like throw a match? Tables and chairs match versus

761
02:35:37,129 --> 02:35:51,219
Tommy Hawk. I just beat this guy's ass. Oh God. You gained 80 pounds. Tables and ladders and chairs

762
02:35:51,219 --> 02:35:57,079
match versus this guy. I'm actually really happy about that because that means I have no health,

763
02:35:57,079 --> 02:36:10,309
but neither should he. He just tapped out at zero health. Going right for the table already.

764
02:36:10,870 --> 02:36:33,659
Okay. All right. I can't believe I gained almost 100 pounds. Taking the announcements table.

765
02:36:43,959 --> 02:36:47,799
We're all holding chairs. Wrestling is a business more than anything else, so it doesn't really

766
02:36:47,799 --> 02:36:55,930
matter who wins or loses. For instance, if you were to pay me $160, I could make sure this match

767
02:36:55,930 --> 02:37:09,750
goes your way. Sure, I'll pay you $160. It's a pleasure doing business with you. I'll do everything

768
02:37:09,750 --> 02:37:20,940
in my power to make sure you win. Okay. Do you think we probably should have did that backstage

769
02:37:20,940 --> 02:37:47,340
before we got on the ring? Wait, what? Oh my God. Make sure I win. I got to put him through

770
02:37:47,340 --> 02:37:55,299
that huge thing over there, right? All right. Get over here. Shit. No, I wanted to put him through

771
02:37:55,299 --> 02:38:18,940
it. Give me that. Give me that. I don't know. I don't care what it is. Oh my God. These eyes

772
02:38:18,940 --> 02:38:34,100
made him fucking weird. I just fucked him up. Get on that table. Did I? Oh, wait. He broke it.

773
02:38:34,100 --> 02:38:47,049
He's blocked it. Are you kidding me? I want to get up on there. I need to get him up on here and

774
02:38:47,049 --> 02:39:01,850
we got to make this. I got to do this. How do I get him up there? Will he come up here?

775
02:39:01,850 --> 02:39:15,739
Holy shit. I'm so high. Oh my God. Dude, I paid you. I paid you almost $200, man. That's no way

776
02:39:15,739 --> 02:40:02,120
you're going to do that. Oh, the eye. Oh, fuck. I need to get you up here. Oh, shit. Give me,

777
02:40:02,120 --> 02:40:11,579
give me, give me, give me. I wonder how you place him on the table. Just give me the chair and I'll

778
02:40:11,579 --> 02:40:28,170
be fine. All right. Whatever. Whatever. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. Just run. Don't let him.

779
02:40:28,170 --> 02:40:46,299
We're good. Thank you, ref. I need to do more tables and shit. God damn it. I love how the

780
02:40:46,299 --> 02:41:05,799
referee is just doing this. Do safe play. Just kill him. Nice catch, dude. In the head. Way more

781
02:41:05,799 --> 02:41:19,450
damage if it's in the head. Okay. Give me that table. Watch out. Give it to me. Give it to me.

782
02:41:19,450 --> 02:41:32,389
Give me that table. Let it go. Let that shit go. Eat shit. Let's go. Oh my God. I just, he's done.

783
02:41:32,389 --> 02:41:41,829
Goodbye. He's dead. It was never any chance of you giving me a fair chance in this match. Outback.

784
02:41:41,829 --> 02:41:50,700
Are you up already? Next time you want to mess with me, you better be wearing your ring gear.

785
02:41:52,579 --> 02:42:13,450
That was sick. My profile improved considerably. Uh, Tommy Hawk's profile suffered. I, I, I got

786
02:42:13,450 --> 02:42:19,909
offered to wrestle for that organization and they never called me back. I've won like seven of my

787
02:42:19,909 --> 02:42:28,489
last eight matches in a row. I got it. Congratulations, Jerma. You followed my advice and made your

788
02:42:28,489 --> 02:42:34,920
prospects better than ever. I wish I could offer you a reward, but at this level experience is the

789
02:42:34,920 --> 02:42:45,420
only reward there is. Okay. Single. Why? I don't want to fight this guy again. Hardcore singles

790
02:42:45,420 --> 02:42:53,979
match? Why do I have to do this again with Tommy Hawk? He just got paid in exposure. Yeah. Um,

791
02:42:55,260 --> 02:43:02,520
at what point does this guy leave me alone? Hardcore singles. All right. I'm just going to

792
02:43:02,520 --> 02:43:10,299
get the chair and he's going to mic this time. There's dynamite over there. I'm just going to

793
02:43:10,299 --> 02:43:20,170
throw it at him. This guy's my nemesis. Yeah, but just because somebody's your nemesis doesn't mean

794
02:43:20,170 --> 02:43:49,260
you face them in a match every day. No, actually wait. God damn it. Give me the fucking mic.

795
02:43:49,260 --> 02:43:59,899
Let's go. All right. What do you have to say? All week we've been polling fans on which match

796
02:43:59,899 --> 02:44:11,270
they would like to see and they voted for Jerma versus Tommy Hawk in a hardcore match and an

797
02:44:11,270 --> 02:44:19,540
arcade match. Who can get to a thousand points in Gallagher first? I think I just got hit by the

798
02:44:19,540 --> 02:44:37,399
bell. He hit me in the face. I'm 90% positive. I'm on the ground right now. Oh, those rules suit

799
02:44:37,399 --> 02:44:42,790
me perfectly. So it seems these fans want to see you suffer. No, they just felt they had to do

800
02:44:42,790 --> 02:44:59,860
something this drastic to make one of your matches entertaining. All right. I'm getting the ladder.

801
02:44:59,860 --> 02:45:21,750
Fuck it. I'm going right for the ladder. What's wrong with this ladder? Holy shit. You suck. Oh

802
02:45:21,750 --> 02:45:31,430
my God. Get out of the way, ref, please. Oh, I didn't hit me in the face. It bounced back and

803
02:45:31,430 --> 02:45:50,520
springboarded into my mouth. Great. Excellent. And now I'm like tired. You don't block a chair

804
02:45:50,520 --> 02:46:09,530
shot like that. You really don't. I got him. Why would I do this? Don't worry. This isn't an

805
02:46:09,530 --> 02:46:16,180
invasion so much as an Exodus because I'm leaving Maple Leaf Grappling Federation. Oh, are you?

806
02:46:16,180 --> 02:46:33,959
Cool. I'm seeing stars. I'm not kidding. I have to slow down. This game is going to hurt me.

807
02:46:33,959 --> 02:46:38,299
I'm actually seeing like stars right now. That all the air just came out of my body again.

808
02:46:38,299 --> 02:46:48,149
I, I need to pause it. I promised I was going to settle down too. And it just doesn't matter.

809
02:46:53,500 --> 02:46:56,700
That is just so stupid. Why? Why? This whole scenario is so dumb.

810
02:47:02,020 --> 02:47:08,360
The guy interrupts the match to tell us that he's changing his, he's leaving this league to go to a

811
02:47:08,360 --> 02:47:13,559
different league. Get the fuck out of here. Like, what do you do? Why are you here? There's no reason

812
02:47:13,559 --> 02:47:20,969
for you to do that here. And this guy was so mad about it. I tried to jump. I was on top of the

813
02:47:20,969 --> 02:47:27,770
ladder and I believe, I believe he pushed me off the ladder, climbed on top of the ladder and was

814
02:47:27,770 --> 02:47:32,090
so annoyed with what this guy was saying. It jumps off the ladder into him. You know what I mean?

815
02:47:32,889 --> 02:47:37,770
That whole scenario just makes all the gas leave the body. You know what I mean? Like, what the

816
02:47:37,770 --> 02:47:55,700
fuck? I'm on the ground. Okay. So, but who is this, who's this, what, I don't know. What's this guy's

817
02:47:55,700 --> 02:47:59,940
problem? Is he just, he just, I don't, I've no, I can't even describe what's happening. This is

818
02:47:59,940 --> 02:48:13,340
ridiculous. Oh shit. He's going to pin me. I keep going over that in my head over and over again.

819
02:48:16,520 --> 02:48:24,329
Um, please, can I have that back? Oh, this is just a fight to who gets to play with the camera.

820
02:48:24,889 --> 02:48:39,799
Off the ladder. We're going to get some ladder action here. You want to come face me on the

821
02:48:39,799 --> 02:49:01,420
ladder? Can I hit him? Oh shit. All right. Give it, I gotta get a chair or something. I'm gonna,

822
02:49:01,420 --> 02:49:07,559
no, I gotta whip him into the, what are you doing? Get the fuck out of here. Why does this guy come

823
02:49:07,559 --> 02:49:24,520
in the ring? I'm hugging this guy. Whose belt is this? Whose belt is that? A championship belt?

824
02:49:28,059 --> 02:49:42,100
The camera. Shit. He's videotaping. This is how I felt when I was filming weddings. I used to film

825
02:49:42,100 --> 02:49:46,870
weddings guys and sometimes you just didn't know what the hell to film, especially during the dance

826
02:49:46,870 --> 02:49:51,290
stuff. Somebody was always doing something weird and it was like, oh fuck, but do I record like the

827
02:49:51,290 --> 02:49:56,329
drunk uncle guy, like doing a break dance or should I go like film the bride and groom kissing?

828
02:49:56,329 --> 02:50:17,290
It was incredibly difficult. I don't even know who I hit. I don't care. This is a, this is a weight.

829
02:50:17,290 --> 02:50:29,100
Oh God. All right. Here we go. Who is this mustard guy? Why is he in the ring?

830
02:50:31,620 --> 02:50:37,399
Is this guy in here? Why are you in here? Get out of here. Get the fuck out of the ring. I don't

831
02:50:37,399 --> 02:50:57,829
even know. Is this guy an audience member? I have to. Five minutes remaining. All right. Here's the

832
02:50:57,829 --> 02:51:01,989
plan. I'm going to knock him in the head with this and I'm going to go off the top turn buckle and

833
02:51:01,989 --> 02:51:34,100
spin him. Okay. Let's go. Big splash to end it. Come on. Why is Jordan of his teeth? What are you

834
02:51:34,100 --> 02:51:50,250
doing? No, this guy is dual welding. Don't let him pin you right now. Don't let him pin you. Come

835
02:51:50,250 --> 02:52:12,760
on. Get the mounting in here. What's he doing? Fuck. I missed him. Oh my God. I was trying to

836
02:52:12,760 --> 02:52:27,079
like Sonic roll on him. I'm not going to get up. Balls count anywhere and I'm still on the ground.

837
02:52:27,079 --> 02:52:48,629
Come on. Don't let him do it. What just happened? I don't know. All right. Get some breath here.

838
02:52:48,629 --> 02:52:52,059
You're not going to. Oh my God. He did it. I didn't think he was going to do it. I didn't think he was

839
02:52:52,059 --> 02:52:58,489
going to do it. I didn't think the AI was going to do it. I didn't think the AI was going to do it.

840
02:52:58,489 --> 02:53:09,989
Nowhere in my brain was the AI actually going to jump off the top rope and do that. I love this

841
02:53:09,989 --> 02:53:38,649
game. What a fucking mess. I just have to pin him. I hit the mic. Finally. Just pin him. Go. Ref.

842
02:53:38,649 --> 02:54:08,540
Fuck. Do you see that guy over there? Just looking, just watching this guy was asleep.

843
02:54:11,260 --> 02:54:22,569
I'm going to get pinned and lose now. This is fantastic. All right. Get up. How has this guy

844
02:54:22,569 --> 02:54:30,120
gained? I beat this guy's head in with a bench weight. You know what I mean? It's not even

845
02:54:30,120 --> 02:54:35,510
possible to get up from that. I had it long ways going into his mouth. Like that guy is dead

846
02:54:35,510 --> 02:54:56,540
in one of those, not five or 10. All right. This is the, this is it right here. You are seriously

847
02:54:56,540 --> 02:55:20,229
going to fuck this up, aren't you? One minute remaining. Ref. That's it. Oh my God. That's it.

848
02:55:20,229 --> 02:55:40,520
Pin him. You piece of shit. You got to be fucking kidding me. Don't even. There's only 19 seconds

849
02:55:40,520 --> 02:56:14,149
left. Ah, what the fuck? Oh my God. No status effects. Tommy Hawk's profile has risen after

850
02:56:14,149 --> 02:56:22,139
that. Okay. Yeah. He got his ass kicked for 15 straight minutes. Duke Miniman has generated a

851
02:56:22,139 --> 02:56:34,040
buzz. That was so funny. Oh, that was so stupid. I couldn't have gone any better. I feel like I've

852
02:56:34,040 --> 02:56:38,200
just been like wheeze laughing this whole time. Like you've all you've gotten is like loud laugh

853
02:56:38,200 --> 02:56:45,620
sounds. Sharon has received her, renewed her contract. Lola has left Strong Style Wrestling.

854
02:56:46,950 --> 02:56:56,790
Psycho Kid has left Super Lucha Libre. Okay. Okay. Cameron Cool has been released. He's free agent.

855
02:56:57,670 --> 02:57:03,690
Cameron Cool has come down with an illness in his poor health this week. What? All right, here we go.

856
02:57:03,690 --> 02:57:07,459
Remember, don't you ever wish that there was someone in your corner to guide you to victory.

857
02:57:07,459 --> 02:57:13,450
This is the guy that's been supplying me steroids. So long as you give me my cut,

858
02:57:13,450 --> 02:57:23,379
I'll make sure you never lose another match. What do you mean my cut? I let the steroid guy

859
02:57:23,379 --> 02:57:37,879
be my manager, but we need to get signed first. I feel like I need somebody because it's a pretty

860
02:57:37,879 --> 02:57:43,110
much a coin flip. If somebody's going to interfere with the match, I just grab a microphone, start

861
02:57:43,110 --> 02:57:53,459
talking, and then attack me. It's 50%. No, it's not. No, fuck off. Yeah, whatever. I can be solo.

862
02:57:53,459 --> 02:57:57,770
Didn't I take those goggles off? Why are they still on? I can be your best friend or your worst

863
02:57:57,770 --> 02:58:03,260
enemy. Instead of helping you, now I'm going to make sure you lose every match. Great. That was

864
02:58:03,260 --> 02:58:17,590
a great idea. Tag team versus Tommy Hawk's team. Training session versus somebody. Nothing scheduled

865
02:58:17,590 --> 02:58:33,579
here. And then a public show. All right. Well, here comes a tag team. Who's my partner? Lucy Lakes

866
02:58:33,579 --> 02:58:51,000
and Tommy Hawk. What's wrong with Lucy? Uh, it doesn't look very well. I don't know what to say.

867
02:58:54,440 --> 02:58:58,840
Cracked out? No, I think she's really tired. I think she has zero health. This should be easy.

868
02:58:59,930 --> 02:59:09,610
You can't come into the ring with zero health. And Schmoke. Are you kidding me? What?

869
02:59:10,569 --> 02:59:18,569
When did this alliance happen? He's fucking tired too. Hey, evil corns. Thanks for the 25 community

870
02:59:18,569 --> 02:59:37,209
subs. He's so tired. You all right? He's sleepy. He said I'm sleepy. What? You all right? I'm sleepy.

871
02:59:39,450 --> 02:59:44,440
All right. Come on, Schmoke. I'll order. I know you're watching backstage, which is the safest

872
02:59:44,440 --> 02:59:51,430
place for you to be, but I'll get my hands on you one day. And this is just a preview. What will

873
02:59:51,430 --> 03:00:17,430
happen? That I just won. Why would you have Lucy Lakes be in first? Ow. What does it mean? What

874
03:00:17,430 --> 03:00:24,010
does it legal? What do you mean legal? That's a rope break. Uh, dude, that's a rope break.

875
03:00:24,010 --> 03:00:42,579
What the fuck's going on here? Why is he doing that? Can I tag him in? No. Why would I ever

876
03:00:42,579 --> 03:01:08,250
tag him in? I can make sure he can't tag anybody. Fuck. Ah, fuck. I'm so tired. Here we go. All

877
03:01:08,250 --> 03:01:16,500
right. I'm going to do some more moves. I have like an up B. I have a down B. What's he doing?

878
03:01:16,500 --> 03:01:38,469
Why is there always a table too? We go. Nice move. Come up. Bring it together. I need more.

879
03:01:38,469 --> 03:01:52,729
I need chain wrestling. Holy shit. Oh my God. Lucy Lakes. What the fuck was that?

880
03:01:52,729 --> 03:02:20,149
Oh, where are you going? All right. Pick them up. Chain wrestling. Let's go. I'm going to do up.

881
03:02:20,149 --> 03:02:31,770
I'm going to do left B and I'm going to go down B. Oh, it's the kick move. Okay. I hurt my back

882
03:02:31,770 --> 03:02:43,799
doing that. Nice. All right. I'm going to have my special. This should be pretty easy. Submission.

883
03:02:43,799 --> 03:02:58,870
Yeah. Let's do a submission. Smoke. Smoke. Grab him. Smoke. Smoke. Do something. Smoke.

884
03:03:03,670 --> 03:03:17,430
What's going on? All right. I'm tagging in smoke. How do I tag him in? Where is he? All right. Smoke.

885
03:03:17,430 --> 03:03:33,690
Let's go. How do I tag in smoke? Come on in smoke. Do your thing. Box him. Holy shit. He's like a

886
03:03:33,690 --> 03:03:45,260
champion boxer. Get off the top turn buckle. Can I just go over there? I'm just going to go over

887
03:03:45,260 --> 03:04:03,579
there and just pull her down. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. All right. I'm leaving. I'm leaving.

888
03:04:03,579 --> 03:04:06,940
I'm leaving. I'm leaving. I'm trying to leave. I'm literally trying to get out of the ring right

889
03:04:06,940 --> 03:04:32,760
now. Get him. You idiot. Tag me in. Tag me in. Come here. Tag me in. Tag me in. Tag me in.

890
03:04:32,760 --> 03:04:44,600
Old man. You're all washed up now. Come on. Tag me in. Good job. This is it. Wait. It's okay.

891
03:04:44,600 --> 03:05:14,739
Here we go. Game over. Count it. Count it. What's with the slow ass counts? Count it. What the

892
03:05:26,549 --> 03:05:31,879
This ref is paid off guaranteed by them. Like I did. Remember that time I did that?

893
03:05:31,879 --> 03:05:51,959
Boop slam. I'm going to have my special in a second. I don't know what I'm doing here with

894
03:05:51,959 --> 03:06:09,659
this guy, but I'm... Holy shit. I got my special in a second. Oh, it's over. It's over. Stunner.

895
03:06:09,659 --> 03:06:23,379
That's it. That was a one count. I don't know how. What happened? That was a one count.

896
03:06:23,379 --> 03:06:33,850
Come on. Shmo. You got to do something. Whatever his name is. Shmork? What's this guy's name?

897
03:06:35,819 --> 03:07:04,739
What? So that was a total screw job is what happened. Um, well, maybe I guess I deserve that.

898
03:07:04,739 --> 03:07:26,170
Omnihoc Stamin has risen to 80% of participating. Yeah. Great. Lucy Lake with zero HP. One, two,

899
03:07:26,170 --> 03:07:32,309
three. Now what? We're running short of staff tonight. Could you sit in on commentary? Oh,

900
03:07:32,309 --> 03:07:38,459
I love this. Yes. Absolutely. Let's go. I need a contract. I've been in wrestling school for three

901
03:07:38,459 --> 03:07:55,690
hours. What the hell? Winston Barker and John Crockett. I turned the contract down. I didn't

902
03:07:55,690 --> 03:08:06,340
think that was going to be the only one ever. I taunt. No, I'm not going to do anything stupid

903
03:08:06,340 --> 03:08:10,389
this time. I'm just going to actually commentate. I'm not going to get up and like punch the guy

904
03:08:10,389 --> 03:08:27,719
next to me. I didn't even know it was possible. So what, what was this match type? Is this just

905
03:08:27,719 --> 03:08:33,500
a singles match or what? It's a sumo match. Okay. I'm going to say this is going to be really,

906
03:08:33,500 --> 03:08:41,670
really, really early. If that's the thing that he's going to ask. Okay. You know what it takes

907
03:08:41,670 --> 03:08:45,989
to win. How long do you see this match going? It's the same thing. The AI is just so dumb.

908
03:08:45,989 --> 03:08:49,670
They're going to get too close to the ropes and bump into each other. Less than five minutes.

909
03:08:57,399 --> 03:09:02,100
Commentating to no one. Well, there's a broadcast at home. Holy shit. The announcer.

910
03:09:02,819 --> 03:09:10,840
That was the guy announcing the game. I think, was that the guy that was like doing,

911
03:09:10,840 --> 03:09:18,549
ladies and gentlemen. Okay. Five minutes. It's going to have, it's going to be over right now.

912
03:09:18,549 --> 03:09:30,229
What's the guy looking at? Why are you looking at me? Quit looking at me. I got,

913
03:09:30,229 --> 03:09:46,520
I got my money on, uh, why is the guy staring at me? Gotta go over the top ropes. He's going

914
03:09:46,520 --> 03:10:02,180
over right now. It's over. Oh shit. He went the wrong way. I was just staring at John Crockett.

915
03:10:02,420 --> 03:10:08,389
I, I, can I, can I do like commentary? No, we just sit here and watch. Unless I want to go

916
03:10:08,389 --> 03:10:18,709
interfere and be an asshole. Get in there. No, not yet. Unless I have to. I need to get popularity.

917
03:10:18,709 --> 03:10:44,360
People hate me. I keep losing respect. Ref versus the ring announcer. It's okay to be hated. Who

918
03:10:44,360 --> 03:10:54,389
are the contestants? Russell Haystacks and who's the other one? Roland Wiener. Off the ropes we

919
03:10:54,389 --> 03:11:00,229
have, uh, Haystacks going into the corner here. No, going outside. Referee now and Coach Emerson

920
03:11:00,229 --> 03:11:05,559
decides and the ring announcer at the same time coming in the ring. Doug Turner now has got

921
03:11:05,559 --> 03:11:10,520
Haystacks by the waist as we have a little bit of an altercation outside as Haystacks misses the

922
03:11:10,520 --> 03:11:15,639
grapple going into the referee. But no, it seems like Coach Emerson has some type of barbell in

923
03:11:15,639 --> 03:11:19,659
his hand and the ring announcer seem to be climbing the ropes and going down at the same

924
03:11:19,659 --> 03:11:24,340
time. Maybe practice seems exercising. Good workout for you calves and your hamstrings.

925
03:11:24,979 --> 03:11:33,159
Into the ring goes the barbell as Haystacks now big right slap into the face of Haystacks.

926
03:11:33,159 --> 03:11:34,920
And that's it, ladies and gentlemen. That's going to be, no, it's not.

927
03:11:43,049 --> 03:11:50,440
He almost eliminated himself, it seems. As we have these two guys are just freaking me out.

928
03:11:50,440 --> 03:11:59,159
They just keep doing this. That would have been so funny. Rope break there as the ring announcer is

929
03:11:59,159 --> 03:12:06,950
still very angry with the referee. Watch out for that bell there as Haystacks comes into

930
03:12:06,950 --> 03:12:11,129
Roland Wiener and he gets caught with an arm bar. Referee is going to probably try to break this

931
03:12:11,129 --> 03:12:17,909
one up. No, there he is again. You know what? Hold on a minute. It seems like German 985 has

932
03:12:17,909 --> 03:12:24,549
decided he's going to get up from his chair and he is walking over towards Roland Wiener right now.

933
03:12:24,549 --> 03:12:29,610
Or John Crockett. I believe it's John Crockett who German 985 is going to be walking over towards.

934
03:12:30,739 --> 03:12:34,899
As he gets close enough, German 985 I believe is going to, looks like he's getting a,

935
03:12:34,899 --> 03:12:38,739
he's going to do a spinning punch right into John Crockett. There goes John Crockett now.

936
03:12:39,379 --> 03:12:44,120
On the ground, German 985 has decided that that is going to be the place he's going to go. Another

937
03:12:44,120 --> 03:12:53,819
right hand onto John Crockett. Roland gets grabbed by the arm and is getting his arm bent backwards

938
03:12:53,819 --> 03:12:59,739
out while he's, while Roland has just grabbed him and tossed him over the side arm bar.

939
03:12:59,739 --> 03:13:09,959
Oh, I don't even know what just happened. I thought it was a sumo match. He's still

940
03:13:09,959 --> 03:13:20,700
holding on to me. I'm losing health for this, aren't I? This is supposed to be a like relaxing

941
03:13:20,700 --> 03:13:28,489
day. Doug Turner's status has not been affected. Winston Barker, it's improved.

942
03:13:28,489 --> 03:13:40,040
Emerton's disappointed. Okay. The Women's Champion. Alright, now what? I've been keeping

943
03:13:40,040 --> 03:13:43,559
an eye on your progress and I think some changes need to be made. Well, give me a contract so I can

944
03:13:43,559 --> 03:13:49,639
work for something. You need better attitude to help with what we're trying to build here.

945
03:13:50,200 --> 03:13:54,409
Improve your attitude to 78% by the second week in November or give your spot to someone who

946
03:13:54,409 --> 03:14:01,610
appreciates it. All right. Confrontation versus Schmoke. Well, this does make sense because he

947
03:14:01,610 --> 03:14:08,180
just screwed me in the last match, which is completely unfortunate. What's going on here?

948
03:14:08,819 --> 03:14:17,399
Ugging Lucy Lake pretending to be my tag team partner, paying the ref? That was a 3v1. That

949
03:14:17,399 --> 03:14:32,629
wasn't fair. What does he have to say? Wasn't I friends with this guy in the beginning of the

950
03:14:32,629 --> 03:15:02,649
game? Why did that change? I'm not going anywhere without a weapon. That guy's a ladder. I'm not

951
03:15:02,649 --> 03:15:10,100
making that mistake. All right. What do you have to say? You made me look bad for the last time,

952
03:15:10,100 --> 03:15:15,500
German. Why should I tolerate failure? When you cost me a win, if I didn't know better,

953
03:15:15,500 --> 03:15:18,860
I'd say you were doing it on purpose. Betrayal is the only way you could have hurt anybody.

954
03:15:18,860 --> 03:15:25,989
You betrayed me. We all make mistakes, Schmoke, and agreeing to work with you was my biggest.

955
03:15:25,989 --> 03:15:34,700
What defines us is what happens next. And you'll need another excuse after I cost you this win.

956
03:15:39,930 --> 03:15:45,340
And why is that legal again? Why is that legal again? And why is it legal for him to have like

957
03:15:45,340 --> 03:16:10,780
a stepladder? Get away from me. Get away from me. We were friends, Schmoke. We could have been good

958
03:16:10,780 --> 03:16:18,790
friends. But instead, you had to be the traitor. And then you paint me as the traitor. That's

959
03:16:18,790 --> 03:16:32,680
bullshit. I'm sorry, but I have to do this. American Psycho? It's hip to be square.

960
03:16:32,680 --> 03:16:44,840
It's hip to be square. Hey, Paul! I'll fight my friends a minute soon. I'll watch them on TV.

961
03:16:54,940 --> 03:17:07,430
What just happened? I knocked out Schmoke in one minute. Schmoke's profile suffered. I don't have

962
03:17:07,430 --> 03:17:19,989
any friends. I need to make my attitude better though. Okay. More happenings in the league.

963
03:17:20,790 --> 03:17:25,479
German has been challenged to increase his attitude. What am I with it right now? 75?

964
03:17:26,120 --> 03:17:31,620
This is my only friend. Why are you hanging out with people like Outback? I thought I was the only

965
03:17:31,620 --> 03:17:40,260
friend you needed, Germo. Why are you gatekeeping me from having friends? I need to see other people.

966
03:17:42,280 --> 03:17:47,350
I'm not even friends with Outback. You got weird information. I don't even know who that is.

967
03:17:52,149 --> 03:17:57,559
I don't even know what he's talking about. I'm glad to hear it, Germo. We can't allow anybody

968
03:17:57,559 --> 03:18:11,590
else to come between us. Okay. This guy's... I don't like this guy. My attitude. Can I make...

969
03:18:11,590 --> 03:18:25,430
I can't make my attitude better. How do I increase my attitude? What do I do? I have this match

970
03:18:25,430 --> 03:18:46,180
coming up next. Go to relationships. Story enemy is now Outback. Real enemy is Outback. Why do you

971
03:18:46,180 --> 03:18:57,450
think I was my friend? This guy hates me. It's RNG based. You basically lost. Oh, did I? I'm

972
03:18:57,450 --> 03:19:04,780
sorry. I'm proceeding. Did I do any... Wait. I at least should level up like strength or something,

973
03:19:04,780 --> 03:19:23,180
right? How do I get a better attitude? 75%. I did it. No, I didn't. Did I? What did I need? 78.

974
03:19:23,739 --> 03:19:38,489
Shit. Okay. Oh, I'm in trouble. Germo's been challenged. 78. All right. I think I have...

975
03:19:38,489 --> 03:20:00,870
I mean, even if I lose this match, I need to get that attitude up. Come on. Fuck. Shoot,

976
03:20:00,870 --> 03:20:24,010
fight versus... Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on? Shoot, fight. Okay. I'm so tired now.

977
03:20:26,280 --> 03:20:56,469
Oh my God. This is in an octagon. I can't even climb the ring. Wait, is the... Do I just have to

978
03:20:56,469 --> 03:21:08,520
leave the ring? You won't have to worry about attitude when you're dead. I still think I can

979
03:21:08,520 --> 03:21:17,159
beat this guy. Taking the chair from... Okay. I thought he was... I thought the guy was still

980
03:21:17,159 --> 03:21:21,829
sitting in it and he was going to bring him in with a guy sitting in the chair. Fall down, please.

981
03:21:22,549 --> 03:21:34,459
I just took the mic from his hand. There's nowhere to run now that I got you locked in.

982
03:21:34,459 --> 03:21:37,100
Only one of us is getting out of here in one piece and it's not going to be you.

983
03:21:37,659 --> 03:21:44,170
I'm not locked in here with you. You're locked in here with me. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God.

984
03:21:44,170 --> 03:21:48,979
Get me out. Get me out. Get me out. Get me out. Get me out of the ring. Get me out. Get me out.

985
03:21:56,219 --> 03:22:00,379
Is he going to climb in here? This guy sucks. Actually, this guy might actually be the thing

986
03:22:00,379 --> 03:22:22,840
that helps me. I think... God, here he comes. No. My attitude is down. I'm dead. It's over.

987
03:22:29,239 --> 03:22:33,239
I need to... We're running short on staff, Terma. Can I count on you to referee one of the matches?

988
03:22:34,760 --> 03:22:47,610
Yes, this is my last chance. Can I get my attitude up? It's a singles match. I'm the referee. What

989
03:22:47,610 --> 03:23:18,540
if I do a really good job? I still have two weeks? I'm so tired. Master Chrome. He's going... He's

990
03:23:18,540 --> 03:23:26,860
going for another hug. Oh, this is the organization that I could have worked for. Look at how well they

991
03:23:26,860 --> 03:23:38,540
treat each other. God damn it. Get out. You have to get out of here. Stay out of the ring. I want

992
03:23:38,540 --> 03:24:04,700
a clean fight. Easy. All right. Oh, right. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

993
03:24:07,379 --> 03:24:21,110
Get this illegal item out of the ring, please. All right. Go on. Are you okay? You okay? You

994
03:24:21,110 --> 03:24:31,209
okay? Are you okay? How you doing? Are you okay? Are you okay? Are you all right? You okay? Sorry.

995
03:24:31,209 --> 03:24:52,409
That looked fun. Put that down. I got to make this interesting. How you doing? Why does this guy

996
03:24:52,409 --> 03:25:14,969
have so much more health than the other guy? What happens if he doesn't get up? All right. Get out.

997
03:25:14,969 --> 03:25:25,340
Excuse me. You're not supposed to be in here. I said get out. Coach Emerson, you're... You're

998
03:25:25,340 --> 03:25:35,819
out of here. I kind of want the guy with less health to win because I don't know,

999
03:25:35,819 --> 03:25:43,879
it's more interesting to me. Let's see if I can like bait them into doing stupid things.

1000
03:25:43,879 --> 03:25:59,399
What if I put a table in here? Where's the table? Where's the table? I need to find the table.

1001
03:26:02,090 --> 03:26:14,090
Trash can lid. Get off the... All right. Now you're just being goofy. Hey, what are you doing in here?

1002
03:26:14,090 --> 03:26:24,260
Get out. Leave. Leave. This guy is just acting like a toddler. I think this guy tapped out already

1003
03:26:24,260 --> 03:26:32,700
like three times. Okay, so I can disqualify people but will I be disqualified from refereeing if I

1004
03:26:32,700 --> 03:27:01,530
do this? No. It's an illegal item. Excuse me. What the fuck? How do you do that? Holy shit,

1005
03:27:01,530 --> 03:27:13,319
he got me a seat. This is awesome. Oh wait, hold on. I got a better idea. It's time to be the world

1006
03:27:13,319 --> 03:27:24,409
shittiest rep. Excuse me. Well, you knocked me down. I can't even count. How am I supposed to

1007
03:27:24,409 --> 03:27:44,709
count when you knock me down and I'm not even ready? I really hope that nobody does anything

1008
03:27:44,709 --> 03:27:58,899
illegal behind me. It would be such a shame if somebody were to do something illegal. Work. I

1009
03:27:58,899 --> 03:28:07,780
feel like I'm watching my son at the playground. Hey, hey, get out of here. You're not supposed to

1010
03:28:07,780 --> 03:28:20,440
be in here, man. Oh, whatever. I don't fucking care. Just don't do anything dumb. World's worst

1011
03:28:20,440 --> 03:28:56,659
lifeguard. What am I doing? Shit, I'm trying to jump over the ropes. Count. Oh, right. One, two,

1012
03:28:56,659 --> 03:29:27,159
three, four. I forgot I was supposed to count. Oh, right. Whoops. Come on, give me some reputation.

1013
03:29:27,159 --> 03:29:44,709
Give me some attitude. Seventy-nine attitude. Seventy-eight. Come on. Shit. Yeah. Oh,

1014
03:29:44,709 --> 03:29:53,110
there has been challenged and I don't think I got it. Oh, I'm in trouble now. I don't know what to

1015
03:29:53,110 --> 03:30:05,690
do to make my attitude better. I can cheat? What do you mean cheat? I can't cheat. What, a database?

1016
03:30:05,690 --> 03:30:17,940
Just take drugs. I can't take any more drugs. I took drugs a bunch. You don't have to make every

1017
03:30:17,940 --> 03:30:29,420
goal. Oh, okay. I'm going to just rest up. Go back to the main menu and edit the universe.

1018
03:30:30,139 --> 03:30:49,979
I guess I could do that. Oh, I failed. I'm afraid this is the end of the road for you. Maybe you'll

1019
03:30:49,979 --> 03:30:57,030
put more effort into your next big idea. After 17 weeks, Jerma has retired from wrestling at the age

1020
03:30:57,030 --> 03:31:03,989
of 35 with meager savings of $2,900. He only ever worked for wrestling school where he won 50% of

1021
03:31:03,989 --> 03:31:29,020
his 12 matches. Shit. I'm gone from the roster. I actually don't exist anymore. I gotta try. Now

1022
03:31:29,020 --> 03:31:38,420
that I know how this game works, I'm going to make a new character. All right. Wrestling school.

1023
03:31:38,420 --> 03:31:46,139
We're going to do C Breeze. We'll be a good guy this time. I gotta go pee. I'll be right back.

1024
03:31:46,139 --> 03:37:25,590
We're going to do another career. I'll be right back. I'm back. Oh, man. This is definitely not

1025
03:37:25,590 --> 03:37:40,069
the game to play after I like pulling muscles and I like right middle shoulder into my lower rib

1026
03:37:40,149 --> 03:37:43,989
is on fire right now, but it's worth it. This is so fucking funny.

1027
03:37:50,020 --> 03:37:58,409
Yeah, this is, this is an absolute 100% buy. Like this is a run to buy this

1028
03:37:59,049 --> 03:38:10,340
in my opinion so far. It's just fun. It's funny. Oh, all right. So let's cut back over here.

1029
03:38:14,809 --> 03:38:18,329
So who I don't want to be me this time. I want to be a huge person.

1030
03:38:18,329 --> 03:38:26,969
Let's do that first. I want to be like seven feet tall. Should I be 710 and 500 pounds?

1031
03:38:28,139 --> 03:38:34,840
Okay. I'm going to be 525 pounds. I'm going to be absolutely massive. I'm going to be like 20.

1032
03:38:34,840 --> 03:38:49,049
You know what I mean? Like 24, 25. Not even on the screen. All right. Let me, I gotta slow down a

1033
03:38:49,049 --> 03:39:02,340
little. Let me see my character. Okay. Hair. Oh shit. Okay. I gotta mute this. Should I put

1034
03:39:02,340 --> 03:39:18,200
the Terraria soundtrack back on? Let me put the Terraria soundtrack on. I think it's still open.

1035
03:39:18,200 --> 03:39:53,739
It is. Make him tiny. I think he's got to be huge. About like a huge Elvis. Make him really skinny.

1036
03:40:03,750 --> 03:40:20,899
I kind of like that face. Do you have like the weird like melted chin? I kind of like that.

1037
03:40:23,530 --> 03:40:45,780
This is scuffed Johnny Cage. Mr. Satan. Holy shit. What a great idea. What does Mr. Satan look like?

1038
03:40:55,459 --> 03:41:11,559
Is this a Batman game? What is Mr. Satan? I gotta get a picture of Mr. Satan. He's an online reference.

1039
03:41:11,559 --> 03:41:23,100
Mr. Satan is a big mustache. It's kind of like got a bald, but it's like an Afro.

1040
03:41:24,139 --> 03:41:37,079
Okay. Let me see. I do a big mustache. There it is. That's actually not bad already.

1041
03:41:37,079 --> 03:42:03,860
I think that's it here. Holy shit. It's Mr. Satan.

1042
03:42:09,879 --> 03:42:17,659
I'm the strongest man in the world. I tell you that much.

1043
03:42:18,700 --> 03:42:47,979
Okay. Beard. He needs... Okay. Glasses off. It's not really Mr. Satan. Hold on. That's kind of...

03:44:03,659 --> 03:44:24,020
Wait. Doesn't he have that? No. He has sideburns. Okay. He's got like a ripped chest.

03:45:12,040 --> 03:45:34,870
It's almost like a pale purple. I think it's purple. Wait. What? Oh, there we go. Red and blue.

1051
03:45:34,870 --> 03:45:49,860
Not even changing color. Oh, okay. There we go. All right. It's like a pale purple. It's like this.

1052
03:45:50,819 --> 03:46:03,219
Right? Like that. Okay. What does he have? I need like a full picture of him. He also kind of has

1053
03:46:06,059 --> 03:46:31,030

1055
03:46:40,360 --> 03:46:53,459

1056
03:46:53,459 --> 03:47:23,530

1057
03:47:24,860 --> 03:47:43,370
a, uh, that looks fine. Now we need pants are everything goes arm. It kind of like baggy pants

1058

1059
03:47:59,430 --> 03:48:10,120

1060
03:48:10,120 --> 03:48:23,110
English. Okay. All the boots, the boots are tucked in actually. Yeah, they're tucked.

1061
03:48:26,489 --> 03:48:41,690
Those look good, but I need them to be purple, at least a little bit. He's got like fuchsia lines

1062
03:48:42,489 --> 03:48:51,510
and the materials got to change. Is there a split one? There we go. All right.

1063
03:48:53,209 --> 03:49:01,510
How do I change this color? Here it is. All right. I was going to flip it.

1064
03:49:08,760 --> 03:49:21,750
Damn it. This is probably as close as I'm going to be able to get this. It's just reversed. Look on

1065
03:49:21,750 --> 03:49:43,020
the shape option in shirts to change the Cape. Okay. All right. There we go. A little more purple.

1066
03:49:43,659 --> 03:49:54,489
All right. That's good. They're not that purple though. They're like a like almost like a maroon.

1067
03:49:58,709 --> 03:50:16,600

His body is baggy. Yeah. What?

1070
03:50:49,500 --> 03:51:03,909
Okay. Like I kind of like that. Cool. All right. That's fine. His skin is going over his pants and

1071
03:51:03,909 --> 03:51:19,930
tucking into his pants. All right. Cool. The hair needs to be a little lighter. Maybe a little bit

1072
03:51:19,930 --> 03:51:33,340
of variation. No, I can't do any big extensions on this. No, I can't. All right. Texture. What

1073
03:51:33,340 --> 03:51:57,670
about the texture? Is that fine? Oh, it's good. It is a curly texture. It doesn't look like there

1074
03:51:57,670 --> 03:52:06,489
is. It's just good. I mean, that's he's kind of balding in this one. Is that actually the one

1075
03:52:06,489 --> 03:52:25,770
we're going to use? I kind of it's the only one. There we go. That's like darker. He needs chest

1076
03:52:25,770 --> 03:52:53,559
hair. Why are there crumbs in his chest? Well, that's the only one I can do. Wait, I don't want

1077
03:52:53,559 --> 03:53:13,049
tattoos. Why are there tattoos all over him now? Is it the arms? Why does he have tattoos all over

1078
03:53:13,049 --> 03:53:20,620
his arm? Oh, there we go. Okay. Oh, wait. I could like add this and make this part of the Cape,

1079
03:53:20,620 --> 03:53:26,680
couldn't I? That's just the Cape, right? Oh, yeah. Look at that. This is just part of the Cape.

1080
03:53:26,680 --> 03:53:44,760
There we go. This would be the same material, though. At least close enough.

1081
03:53:51,829 --> 03:54:20,250
Material two? Material two. It doesn't have wristbands. Does he have gloves? That's not bad.

1082
03:54:20,250 --> 03:54:34,709
That looks more like a Cape. And I got to make the material the same thing. I'm going to sneeze.

1083
03:54:41,299 --> 03:54:58,409
Collar. Yep. That's fine. That's good. All right. Mr. Satan. I'm going to sneeze again, I think.

1084
03:54:58,889 --> 03:55:03,209
I'm trying not to. I'm going to mute. That's the perfect time. I just, I think I fixed it.

1085
03:55:10,360 --> 03:55:45,670
Okay. Legs. That's fine. That hair is awful. I know it is. What about this one? No. I don't

1086
03:55:45,670 --> 03:55:53,110
know which the closest one. No bald spot. No bald spot. All right. All right. This one,

1087
03:55:53,110 --> 03:56:00,620
that one looks fine, right? Ah, that's it. That's fine. That's good. Okay. Now I got to make him

1088
03:56:00,620 --> 03:56:18,809
bigger. Yeah. How big is Mr. Satan? He's at least like seven feet tall, right? Look it up. All

1089
03:56:18,809 --> 03:56:38,540
right. How tall is Mr. Satan? Mr. Satan is 6'2". What? How old is he? I thought this was like a

1090
03:56:38,540 --> 03:56:52,840
typo. He's 736 years old. What the fuck are they talking about? I'm not going to make him that.

1091
03:56:55,030 --> 03:57:09,370
How about 7'2"? He needs to be big and imposing. All right. I'm happy with it. All right. Casual.

1092
03:57:11,030 --> 03:57:23,020
I don't, whatever. It doesn't matter. I don't, it doesn't matter. No, I just changed his body.

1093
03:57:23,020 --> 03:57:45,610
There we go. Okay. Oh, he shaves. All right. Whatever. Whatever. I don't care. Wait. Isn't

1094
03:57:45,610 --> 03:57:50,809
Mr. Satan like the strongest man in America? He's the strongest man in the entire United States.

1095
03:57:50,809 --> 03:57:59,290
I'm thinking this is a different person. Who's that? It's the world. Oh, okay. It's the world.

1096
03:57:59,290 --> 03:58:28,389
Nevermind. Is that this song? Oh, it's Terraria, right? I thought it was Mario Galaxy.

1097
03:58:37,399 --> 03:59:14,059
I don't even care. Let's go. Referee. What are his moves? Gestures. I don't even know what he does.

1098
03:59:14,059 --> 03:59:33,850
Would it be martial arts? Powerful. Oh yeah. He would be standing very tall. Right, right, right.

1099
03:59:33,850 --> 03:59:48,010
Okay. Yeah. Hold the camera. Make a point. Double peace signs. Hands on hips. Grind hips. Go to

1101
03:59:54,329 --> 04:00:13,659
Diamond sign. All right. Look at the P. Peace sign. There's no peace sign.

1102
04:00:14,299 --> 04:00:37,959
Would it just be prayer? He's raised arms. Sure. Yeah, they're good. They're good. Good. Good.

1103
04:00:39,049 --> 04:00:53,180
And middle finger. Middle fingers. All right. Attacks. What does he do? What does he even do?

1104
04:00:54,180 --> 04:01:14,709
Big uppercut. He actually did do the middle finger in the Japanese version. He did. Drop kick is good.

1105
04:01:14,709 --> 04:01:24,360
Forearm. Flying knee. Flying kick. Flying drop kick. That sounds awesome. What is his move? His

1106
04:01:24,360 --> 04:01:31,180
ultimate move. Because that's what we're going to give him for his special. He had very flashy

1107
04:01:31,180 --> 04:01:55,989
big moves. Okay. It was the death punch. Dynamite kick. Spinning heel kick. That's pretty sick.

1108
04:01:56,709 --> 04:02:25,049
That one's sick too. Top rope attack. Look at that one. That's huge. I like, um, super punch. Yep.

1109
04:02:25,049 --> 04:02:34,010
All right. Crushes. These can be pretty normal. Stomp is fine. Leg drop is fine. Running when

1110
04:02:34,010 --> 04:02:40,569
they're on the ground. Double stomp. That sounds good. Flying in the air when they're on the ground.

1111
04:02:40,569 --> 04:02:51,290
How about just like a big splash? We'll go give him a senton bomb. Five star splash. All right.

1112
04:02:51,290 --> 04:03:02,420
So top rope when they're on the ground. Give him dynamite as the prop. I'm hurting the training

1113
04:03:02,420 --> 04:03:21,530
dummy here. You see that? Okay. Here we go. Now these are important. I want to look at the specials.

1174
04:16:17,030 --> 04:16:27,180
oh see ya he's weak yeah but he's the strongest person on earth that move is not good I don't

1175
04:16:27,180 --> 04:16:43,219
like that at all test of strength versus mr satan what are you out of your goddamn mind

1176
04:16:43,219 --> 04:16:52,229
now that's how you really get a battle going I don't think I ever trained with no truth did you

1177
04:17:07,579 --> 04:17:13,879
all right so what happened last time remember last time when I played it went the full duration

1178
04:17:14,280 --> 04:17:26,069
neither one of us could hurt each other I want to kick him right in the fucking face

1179
04:17:27,219 --> 04:17:47,139
like that oh it's time it's time what's the special move oh he's punching with the balls

1180
04:17:47,139 --> 04:18:09,620
that move sucks what a terrible finisher that's not gonna win me any matches that's awful all

1181
04:18:09,620 --> 04:18:34,229
right this is he's done oh my god this sucks that would be so painful he's not tapping out though so

1182
04:18:34,229 --> 04:18:59,780
I mean I'm gonna keep doing it I'm pulling him so far back I have the ref too oh my god dude

1183
04:19:00,899 --> 04:19:05,719
I don't think he can tap out I don't think he's physically able to I don't think he's conscious

1184
04:19:10,760 --> 04:19:40,170
what happened this guy I'm gonna injure this guy all right can I pin him I just pin him

1185
04:19:40,969 --> 04:20:03,909
I gotta end this all right I'm gonna end up with a super kick ruining him yeah good night

1186
04:20:06,979 --> 04:20:27,020
two three that's so rude all right so I just like ended that guy's career Mr. Satan's profile has

1187
04:20:27,020 --> 04:20:38,020
improved considerably by winning convincingly in that that man Buddy Lee has renewed his contract

1188
04:20:38,020 --> 04:20:50,500
all right are I thought this had a hard gamer okay nothing is scheduled so let's just you know

1189
04:20:50,500 --> 04:20:55,690
what if nothing's scheduled I'm gonna go ahead and just do some let's do some strength training

1190
04:21:01,639 --> 04:21:25,049
82 that's good you believe grappling's ratings have risen okay here we go Mr. Satan you ever

1191
04:21:25,049 --> 04:21:36,360
considered changing the strikes in your arsenal oh I like the way that I fight all right I can't

1192
04:21:36,360 --> 04:21:43,719
tell you how to fight I just thought you might want to mix things up a little singles versus

1193
04:21:43,719 --> 04:21:54,459
Tate Madison let's go another person just to absolutely decimate this guy doesn't look

1194
04:21:54,459 --> 04:22:33,000
finished um all right score Ben I know you're cowering backstage clinging that undergraduate

1195
04:22:33,000 --> 04:22:41,260
title of yours that may be the safest place for you right now but that treasure can't stay there

1196
04:22:44,780 --> 04:22:49,100
I want you to pay attention to what happens in this match because you're next

1197
04:22:52,340 --> 04:23:17,860
oh I thought he's beat me oh my god I got him from behind again why is it ref holding the

1198
04:23:17,860 --> 04:24:20,870
microphone like put it down bro perfect suplex what oh wait that's illegal what did I just do

1199
04:24:21,430 --> 04:24:46,969
all right don't fuck this up he's done what are you thinking dude are you serious I'll get you

1200
04:24:46,969 --> 04:25:05,110
every time why is it what's referee what are you doing that Mr. Satan is way better than

1201
04:25:05,110 --> 04:25:11,819
German 985 was this German at five was awful in comparison look how much cleaner these matches

1202
04:25:11,819 --> 04:25:28,340
are and it's not even a stats thing I think the stats got reset didn't they again one two three

1203
04:25:38,420 --> 04:25:52,549
just like a DBZ fight oh my god oh my god that was horrible that was fucking horrible

1204
04:26:00,149 --> 04:26:09,000
that's making me that's making me cringe backwards this guy's actually a formidable

1205
04:26:09,000 --> 04:26:35,690
foe get up all right let's do this one again I don't know what just happened but I think I won

1206
04:26:36,489 --> 04:26:48,069
I think I did a good job there bring the frame rate down on the screen to make it look like a

1207
04:26:48,069 --> 04:26:56,950
DBZ fight what's he doing wait do I have him or does he have me I can't tell I think I had him

1208
04:27:05,770 --> 04:27:31,700
oh that felt good I wanted to go off the ropes all right this match is over holy shit all right

1209
04:27:31,700 --> 04:27:49,479
pin him again again can I catch him with that you get you get to get one move on me that's fine

1210
04:27:49,479 --> 04:28:02,729
now you don't even get one move pin him hate Madison please get up that's not gonna happen

1211
04:28:02,729 --> 04:28:22,969
all right let's break his neck I want to hear those crunches that's it yeah it's it's over

1212
04:28:23,049 --> 04:28:37,290
there's literally nowhere for him to go besides to tap up I'm pulling so hard in his head he's got

1213
04:28:37,290 --> 04:28:47,690
resilience you know what I like about this game I like that you okay so see how if I hold down

1214
04:28:47,690 --> 04:28:58,360
the strike button you do like oh or you can just do it lightly there's a range of holding it

1215
04:28:58,360 --> 04:29:04,440
this is honestly the best like actually wrestling video game that I've played since like no mercy

1216
04:29:04,440 --> 04:29:28,899
I really think that this is actually a good wrestling game does this one make sense the

1217
04:29:28,899 --> 04:29:35,059
new wrestling I've tried to play the new WWE games it's kind of confusing and weirdly controlling

1218
04:29:35,059 --> 04:29:40,819
it's like hard to control it's strange hey Mr. Satan everybody knows that decision was bogus

1219
04:29:40,819 --> 04:29:46,819
are you gonna fall down if you had any decency you would agree to restart this match and prove

1220
04:29:46,819 --> 04:29:54,459
that you can beat me properly um sure fine restart the match let's do it again I'll take

1221
04:29:54,459 --> 04:29:58,299
the shit out of you a second time you know the coward I thought you were but we both know the

1222
04:29:58,299 --> 04:30:18,600
result will be different this time are you leaving don't leave this time I'm gonna kill him okay

1223
04:30:18,600 --> 04:30:25,290
let's see how you feel after this one all right it really yeah it's double or nothing this really

1224
04:30:25,290 --> 04:30:42,100
is just me you know what don't let him get away get into the corner never mind he's this is just

1225
04:30:42,100 --> 04:31:07,270
sad count him fucking count him what are you doing are you kidding me oh my god he's broken

1226
04:31:07,270 --> 04:31:19,670
a damn I really want to like break his neck I know that's like fucked up but I mean this guy you

1227
04:31:19,670 --> 04:31:47,319
can't come in twice what is he inspecting oh my god really I just ended he's dead no you're not

1228
04:31:47,319 --> 04:31:54,120
gonna pin me you know what this is so good to be huge because I will rope break 30 to 40 percent

1229
04:31:54,120 --> 04:32:15,559
of every single pin just because I'm big I am all right what's the UFC thing gonna happen where

1230
04:32:15,559 --> 04:32:33,079
the guy just steps in and starts pulls me off him and they have to call this oh let's lose the test

1231
04:32:33,079 --> 04:32:46,469
of strength the guy that's barely standing there's no way this guy is gonna get up after this shit

1232
04:32:46,469 --> 04:33:12,150
I'm sorry why is he still going get the fuck out of here this is supposed to I've fought him

1233
04:33:12,150 --> 04:33:28,500
let's roll my arm I broke his back that's enough stay down what does it take to keep this guy down

1234
04:33:29,060 --> 04:33:43,459
seriously what does it take to keep this idiot down like just stay down that's it

1235
04:33:47,580 --> 04:34:06,779
finally that is counter established mr satan as a heel what why would that make me a heel the guy

1236
04:34:06,779 --> 04:34:11,740
challenged me to a second fight and I kicked his ass again why does that make me a heel doesn't

1237
04:34:11,740 --> 04:34:26,659
that make him just stupid why do I have to be a bad guy because the other guy is dumb because

1238
04:34:26,659 --> 04:34:32,650
he broke his neck four times whatever that did you're gonna challenge me to a double and nothing

1239
04:34:32,650 --> 04:34:46,729
match in the same day it's because you kept hitting him in the balls oh here's this guy again

1240
04:34:46,729 --> 04:34:50,250
hey mr satan don't you ever wish that there was someone in your corner to guide you to victory

1241
04:34:52,020 --> 04:34:59,080
yeah I mean sometimes I do but I heard that you're a real weirdo I want nothing to do with you

1242
04:35:01,939 --> 04:35:09,340
perhaps we can work together some other time I've always got your back if you need it mr satan

1243
04:35:10,840 --> 04:35:17,060
now this is the creepy guy that only wants to have you be his only friend all right four man

1244
04:35:17,060 --> 04:35:50,180
elimination going for it this is four man just quicken to the point you know samson is that

1245
04:35:50,180 --> 04:36:21,610
this is a john cena thing samson and score bends I like the red duke mini man back at it again

1246
04:36:22,330 --> 04:36:36,459
why do they always do that the ai just goes you know what I'm gonna grab the table for a second

1247
04:36:42,200 --> 04:36:45,639
being forced to defend my title against three of their opponents and that's just not fair

1248
04:36:45,639 --> 04:36:52,580
wait this is for the championship I'm not even out of school there's some sort of conspiracy to

1249
04:36:52,580 --> 04:36:59,590
get the title off of me but I didn't become champion in the first place by backing down

1250
04:36:59,590 --> 04:37:20,970
from a challenge this will be just my biggest win yet we're all stopping this guy hey what are you

like you understand and you're never gonna wake up after that one ever again

1286
04:46:26,540 --> 04:46:38,119
fuck that's my belt actually see you later I'm now that I'm now the champion

by all kinds of agencies I need to get I better get a lot of points for this okay that makes sense

1289
04:47:05,990 --> 04:47:27,529
Mr. Satan the new champion look at that how do I lose points I got the victory Royale still not

1290

signed a lot of changes this week all right now what we've taken each other to hell and back Mr.

1291
04:47:37,540 --> 04:47:44,549
Satan and I've had enough of it I don't even know who this guy is why don't we bury the hatchet so

1292
04:47:44,549 --> 04:47:54,840
that we can both get back to concentrating on our careers let's make peace oh this is Samson oh no

1293
04:47:54,840 --> 04:48:10,500
it's the previous champion um oh you go fuck yourself I just remembered why I hate you so

1294
04:48:10,500 --> 04:48:16,549
much I should have known you couldn't be reasoned with oh yeah I'm supposed to be a good guy

1295
04:48:17,270 --> 04:48:25,959
whatever after three for the undergraduate championship versus hard gainer to win with

1296
04:48:25,959 --> 04:49:07,880
with three matches in row yeah wear that shit get a good shot of this ref hard gainer oh it's

1297
04:49:07,880 --> 04:49:26,700
the skeleton guy okay letting you do your own intro is really cool it is for anyone who wasn't

1298
04:49:26,700 --> 04:49:34,169
paying attention I am the new undergraduate champion of wrestling school a lot of people

1299
04:49:34,169 --> 04:49:41,720
thought it would never happen and you ignorant moron should admit that you're wrong I've achieved

1300
04:49:41,720 --> 04:49:47,720
all this without anybody's support so the only person I think is myself doing a 40 to 50 percent

1301
04:49:47,720 --> 04:49:54,020
Mr. Satan so I can do it for a long period of time here if Mr. Satan will change wrestling school

1302
04:49:54,020 --> 04:50:07,209
forever oh that was not fair all right hard gainer let's see what you made of can you handle a

1303
04:50:07,209 --> 04:50:28,680
fucking flurry of punches like this goodbye get a shot of that one oh it seems that Goku

1304
04:50:28,680 --> 04:50:37,639
seems to have fallen down out of the arena join us next time on Dragon Ball Z see what happens Goku

1305
04:50:46,599 --> 04:51:00,439
oh I hate this voice sorry I gotta do another move besides that nobody's a match for me

1306
04:51:01,080 --> 04:51:08,419
I'm just so strong I'm not even that much different than the Jerma character was though

1307
04:51:08,419 --> 04:51:22,810
that's the thing that's more annoying damn that was cool let's do some more stuff off the ropes

1308
04:51:24,380 --> 04:51:39,319
get in that corner all right this guy's fucked now that I got him on the ground let's go oh

1320
04:54:54,700 --> 04:55:02,040
ever considered changing the way you conduct yourself in the ring what do you mean the way

1321
04:55:02,040 --> 04:55:06,360
you do something can be more important than what you do a few gestures could help you express

1322
04:55:06,360 --> 04:55:20,500
yourself oh he wants me to be nicer sure I can change that's very open-minded of you I look

1323
04:55:20,500 --> 04:55:33,799
forward to seeing the new you um how do I do that all right let's take away the low blow I don't

1324
04:55:33,799 --> 04:55:45,959
want it I want something cool something powerful what the power factor how about just a straight up

1325
04:55:45,959 --> 04:56:16,069
just power bomb yeah the power bomb or that's horrible pop-up stunner no no no more ball

04:56:16,069 --> 04:56:37,479
crushing no I want no more this one do jumping face buster how did your special move is just

1327
04:56:37,479 --> 04:56:50,790
throwing a guy into the ropes horrible got wrench suplex i mean I've been doing a lot of

1328
04:56:50,790 --> 04:56:54,389
submissions he's been working pretty well maybe I should really just do just a special move that

1329
04:56:54,389 --> 04:57:06,099
just rips their head off yeah all right he wants me to have like a I can't even change the gestures

1330
04:57:06,740 --> 04:57:20,099
oh that's all right that's fine this is the last man standing versus score bends

1331
04:57:23,990 --> 04:57:31,369
oh it changes the gestures for you automatically oh this is stupid it's just me waving to the crowd

1332
04:57:32,009 --> 04:57:57,639
I have to be Mr. Nice Guy now wave to the kids all right score bends last man standing make sure

1333
04:57:57,639 --> 04:58:02,840
you pick up a weapon bring it into the ring really really slowly and then drop it because it's

1334
04:58:02,840 --> 04:58:11,299
illegal I've been where you are now Mr. Satan I remember what it's like to be under the

1335
04:58:11,299 --> 04:58:18,090
undergraduate champion but I've also felt something you can't yet imagine and that's the burning

1336
04:58:18,090 --> 04:58:26,060
desire to claim it back if I have to climb over you to get back to the top of the mountain then

1337
04:58:26,060 --> 04:58:34,150
that's what I'm prepared to do anybody worth of this title would have let it go you were losing

1338
04:58:34,150 --> 04:58:41,479
and score bends and you're losing out it's two o'clock in the morning and I don't want to wake

1339
04:58:41,479 --> 04:58:45,000
up my mother in the other room by doing the mr satan voice so I'm doing a really shitty

1340
04:58:45,959 --> 04:58:56,950
awful version of it put that down wait can we even can we use that is that illegal doesn't say it is

1341
04:59:10,900 --> 04:59:18,979
why do I keep hitting myself in the head why do I keep hitting myself why is this what you want is

1342
04:59:18,979 --> 04:59:37,860
that what you're looking for he throat punched me oh my god what happened that hurt me more than it

1343
04:59:37,860 --> 05:00:06,900
hurt him holy shit oh I'm sorry how do I let you go how do I let you go keep counting keep counting

1344
05:00:25,299 --> 05:00:32,729

1345
05:00:32,729 --> 05:00:49,259
I have to stop I can't I'm gonna get hurt why does he keep doing that I don't understand why

1346
05:00:49,259 --> 05:00:57,319
he does that I don't get it why does he hit himself in the face as hard as he can why

1347
05:00:57,319 --> 05:01:20,459
oh no give me that back oh my god he's wearing the belt

1348
05:01:45,770 --> 05:02:09,509
I win oh he suffered considerably considerably mr satan has cemented his reign by defending

1349
05:02:09,509 --> 05:02:19,180
uh the championship again there has to be some reason why maybe if you do it too many times in

1350
05:02:19,180 --> 05:02:24,779
a row you'll just mess up and hit yourself in the face but that it seems to happen all the time

1351
05:02:25,500 --> 05:02:33,930
mr satan's association with matt black has a negative effect on his attitude no it doesn't

1352
05:02:33,930 --> 05:02:49,130
I don't care about that guy why would I care about that guy mr satan why don't you give me

1356
05:03:13,770 --> 05:03:19,819
come up with a mic and talk a bunch of shit about me he didn't like be somebody's manager and hit

1365
05:05:20,069 --> 05:05:27,900
oh he just was crossing the ring oh I made this guy by the way I made craft men yeah I he was

1366
05:05:27,900 --> 05:05:39,990
supposed to be a craft beer guy and I thought it was like funny I'm just loading the ring with

1367
05:05:39,990 --> 05:06:02,500
fucking tables okay he's still in here this is a tables match and we're gonna I'm gonna use them

1376
05:07:50,680 --> 05:07:57,700
I'm just too heavy to stand on three tables I got too cocky I've weighed 600 pounds guys

1377
05:07:58,340 --> 05:08:10,520
that's not being a bad wrestler that's just being too big oh this guy's probably really pissed

1378
05:08:11,159 --> 05:08:15,220
this is the guy that wanted to do the title match but I just lost the title

1379
05:08:15,779 --> 05:08:22,819

1540
05:48:16,250 --> 05:48:21,770
and my concern was I didn't want them to control me losing matches but I just signed a document

1541
05:48:21,770 --> 05:48:29,979
saying that they can control everything including everything which is matches where's my lawyer

06:04:28,119 --> 06:04:34,310
full health I got one more day to get to 82 this is the red light match versus snake Suzuki

1609
06:04:35,110 --> 06:04:51,450

1611
06:05:03,130 --> 06:05:07,930

06:05:07,930 --> 06:05:46,520
to look for what if I quit I always skipped it wait can I quit oh thank god okay we're probably

1613
06:05:46,520 --> 06:06:04,569
gonna stop fairly soon anyways but we're gonna have to find a stopping point because my neck

1614
06:06:04,650 --> 06:06:13,799
right now is way worse than it was four or five hours ago that's a guarantee my leg is shoulder

1615
06:06:13,799 --> 06:06:20,790
and chest red light matches means it's red I want to end this as fast as I can because this looks

1616
06:06:20,790 --> 06:06:45,770
I don't like how this looks is everything is anything legal travel all right against ropes

1617
06:06:45,770 --> 06:06:57,020
let's do a grab I just okay well whatever I fucked up this is the virtual boy match yeah it is

1618
06:06:57,020 --> 06:07:10,549
don't you mean the face all right I didn't mean to do that but it's all right it's effective

1619
06:07:11,110 --> 06:07:31,740
just a slight little hip toss keep the chain wrestling going oh just flip three times I'm

1620
06:07:31,740 --> 06:07:55,369
doing the running punch moves the crowd is silent okay same guy that made hard time you know I

1621
06:07:55,369 --> 06:08:01,880
heard of that too I was gonna play these games a while ago and then I finally comes like you

1622
06:08:01,880 --> 06:08:05,860
know what maybe I'll try it now well when I say now I mean like maybe two or three months ago

1623
06:08:07,209 --> 06:08:13,340

1624
06:08:14,540 --> 06:08:18,139
old one or just wait for him to do the remake and instead was coming out in only a couple months

1625
06:08:18,779 --> 06:08:24,790
I was like well screw it we'll just wait and here we are and this is a special move let's see if we

1626
06:08:24,790 --> 06:08:39,450
can break his neck our time is literally 10 out of 10 you should play it that it happening yeah

1627
06:08:39,450 --> 06:08:58,919
he's oh no our time is like this but it's prison oh I can't even imagine how insane that probably is

1628
06:09:05,619 --> 06:09:08,340
that was a beautiful move and that's a pin for sure no it's not

1629
06:09:18,099 --> 06:09:42,459

1699
06:27:03,020 --> 06:27:11,509
probably I'll let you know tomorrow before I start like maybe two or three hours before the sus which

1700
06:27:11,509 --> 06:27:17,799
will be probably around two three plan for Monday but I might just get up and be fine and we can

1701
06:27:17,799 --> 06:27:24,259
just go at like 2 p.m. uh but I would yeah I would plan for Monday literally every time I've ever

1702
06:27:24,259 --> 06:27:29,860
said it's gonna happen on the earlier day it's never happened one time in 10 years so I'm pretty

1703
06:27:29,860 --> 06:27:38,500
predictable at this point that was awesome I loved every second of that um thanks again for the subs

1704
06:27:38,500 --> 06:27:42,419
there were a lot of subs I missed a lot of them too because I was just sort of completely engrossed

1705
06:27:42,419 --> 06:27:53,479
and everything going on don't push yourself no I'll be okay I I don't worry I take plenty of time

1706
06:27:53,479 --> 06:28:04,439
off if I feel like I can't then I just won't is this the game of the decade um it's definitely one

1707
06:28:04,439 --> 06:28:08,819
of the funnest most I would let let's put it this way it's definitely one of the most entertaining

1708
06:28:08,819 --> 06:28:22,779
games I've played in the last couple of years that's 100% for sure Otto hello this is going

1709
06:28:22,779 --> 06:28:26,779
to be a really long second germa video it's going to be one of those second germa videos it's going

1710
06:28:26,779 --> 06:28:36,419
to be one of those germa 985 videos uh where it's just the wheeze laughter cut between wheeze laughter

1711
06:28:37,430 --> 06:28:40,470
and me progressively getting like a more blown out voice

1712
06:28:47,099 --> 06:28:53,270
by hard time once I get my fill of this we'll see there's a couple there's well actually I

1713
06:28:53,270 --> 06:28:59,849
could tell you this uh remember how I broke my uh vive controller it actually broke and I couldn't

1714
06:28:59,849 --> 06:29:15,029
use it anymore like I it's actually broken um well I got an index so we can do that with the

1715
06:29:15,029 --> 06:29:22,259
knuckle controllers so at some point probably next week I would say we're probably gonna get

1716
06:29:22,259 --> 06:29:29,049
back into VR and do another VR smorgasbord for a night or two at least we'll probably we'll
