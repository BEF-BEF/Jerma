1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:20,359
What if I just turn the stream on, turned it off, waited five minutes, turn the stream on, turn it off, wait five minutes, turn the stream on, turn it off, wait five minutes, and then did like a 72 hour stream after that.

2
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:59,320
Would it be like the boy who cried wolf? Would people be like, all right, fuck this, I'm out of here. Like you missed the 72 hour stream. Hi. Oh, I didn't tweet. There we go. Today we're going to finish Dead Rising. And those of you that were here last night.

3
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:20,099
Oh, I'm ready. I've prepared. I have multiple timelines in case something goes wrong. This is doable. I'm ready. I spent some time making sure I was ready. It's got to be good. It's got to be perfect, but it's doable.

4
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:57,290
I looked at the map. I planned out a route to save as much time as possible. I have a save point right in front of the boss essentially. And I got the blue chainsaw with about 17 minutes to go. It's got to be good. It's got to be perfect, but I can do it. I'm planned. He cheated. No, I didn't cheat. I just after the stream turned off. I got some food. I came back upstairs. I was ready. I was getting tired, but I was like, you know what, let me.

5
00:01:57,969 --> 00:02:32,659
Let me plan out some routes and see if this is humanly possible. I tried one timeline that didn't work out so well. I went and got an Uzi and try it. Nope. Not possible with that one. I tried to go through a shortcut. Didn't happen. I spent about 45 minutes to an hour to get it right. And I got it right. Show your face. Why would I do that? He played off stream. You don't play off stream. And my control was fixed. I got that taken care of too.

6
00:02:38,389 --> 00:03:16,379
To see your tired eyes. I don't want you to see my dark circles under my eyes. No, I'm playing Dead Riley. You owe us that content. Why is my face content? Imagine somebody sends you like you go to like Disney World or something with like your family. And you go through the photos afterwards and you show it to like the grandkids that weren't, that couldn't go. And they're like, this is some good fucking content.

7
00:03:16,379 --> 00:04:01,780
It's nice content. I could see both your faces. You got any more content? What do you want? Just a close up of your face. Okay. Got any more? Face cam. No, I don't do face cam. You know that. I do it like once in a while. I don't like it. I don't like it. You do it all the time. Yeah, but when I don't want to do it, I'm not going to do it. So what's going to happen is after about 25 minutes, I'm going to get pressured.

8
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:41,040
It's turning it on. And then you're going to get a shitload of content. Here we are. Content, please give us some content. No, the reason why everybody wants face cam so bad is because on the off chance that like snot like a booger shoots out of my nose and into my mouth. It's on camera. And it's like I have that now forever. That's why and that's happened probably a few times since I've streamed. I've like accidentally squirted mustard in my eye on stream, but I wasn't on camera. So it's like not a thing that you have clipped.

9
00:04:41,079 --> 00:05:24,110
That's by design. You already slapped yourself. There's nothing to lose. I've probably done that more than once too. All right, here we go. We're going to get going on Dead Rising. I we're in the current timeline. You ready? I have to be very, very, very good about this. So I'm going to let's see if I can do it. I planned it 123 already fucking walked into a wall.

10
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:25,300
Just kill me. Kill me. Kill me. Just kill me. Kill me. This is not in the right save file. Where is the right save file? I told you I was ready. That means I was doable. Where's the one where I actually have to do it? Oh, did I save over it? Day two. See, I'm I told you I got by it. I got by it. I needed to make sure it was possible. I read on a forum somewhere that even if you beat Isabella, the game will still end if you don't have enough time. So I needed to make sure that that wasn't going

11
00:06:17,379 --> 00:07:10,100
to happen. I played for like an extra four minutes. Okay. Which one of these is it? 2328? 2311. Might be this one. Let me try this one. Wait, it's one of the 20s. It's not this one. 2331 day two. 23. It might be this one. It's not this one. Is it this one? No, it's the wrong one. Where am I? Fuck. This is the wrong one. Where is the actual save file? Is it save two?

12
00:07:10,100 --> 00:08:00,779
Save two is level 21. No, it's I have the chainsaw right out front of her door. Did I just not give a fucking save and not care that I beat her? Was I that irritated by this point that I was like, I don't care. I'm just saving it. That may have happened. I think that may have happened. 2245. No, that's way far away. 2311. It might be this one here. Is this it? I think this is it. This is it. This is it. This is it. Okay. So you

13
00:08:00,779 --> 00:09:05,639
guys I Mario maker the level. It's possible. I just want to prove to you that it is. But the thing is I still have to beat this on screen for you to prove it to you. And I'll be honest with you. It was a huge pain in the ass. I was so angry trying to do this even with chainsaw. But it's possible because you've seen the future. Okay, here we go. Fuck. I have to do it perfect. Otherwise, I'm not gonna do it. I blew it already have to do it again. You have to like turn and swing turn and swing. I still might be able to do it. What time is it? I have

14
00:09:05,639 --> 00:10:10,950
five minutes to do this. What? What? I lost. Yeah, it's all right. I got I swung through her for four times. What do you even fuck this? Yeah, let's pretend I've been here all night. I'm going to talk with a good fucked up voice. You already would get a good grab a good grab radius.

15
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:36,070
All right, here we go. No, I think if I honestly, I think I just have to be perfect with it, and then I'll be able to get it once I it's back swing back swing. When she drives by you, you have to back swing or is no you're not gonna be able to hit it. Okay. I'm sorry, guys.

16
00:10:52,330 --> 00:11:05,070
Yeah, you have to get Yeah, no, no jokes aside, you just have to get lucky to like that like that like that like that like that like that. Whoa, my voice is back. Hello. Hey, whoa.

17
00:11:08,159 --> 00:12:20,539
Don't I have to hit her one more time? Come on. Don't you fucking dare. I need to prove I did a Mario maker this. Oh my god, I hate this encounter more than anything. This is so stupid. All right. I lost. I didn't do it fast enough. Game over. Yeah, that's how stupid this is. I did it too late. Okay, you saw me killer. I don't care. You still have to do it. The truth got snapped. So it's did you see how possible it is? I

18
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:40,320
just have to do it. And if somebody grabs me, it's not possible anymore. Not possible anymore. It's not possible anymore. No, I have to just I have to get all the hits. You just have to get lucky and spam the chainsaw on her for me to do this. And it is it's possible because I

19
00:12:40,320 --> 00:13:32,830
already have it done. So I ain't getting stuck here. I'll watch the fucking cutscene on YouTube. I don't give a shit. Get the fuck out of here. I did. You know how many times I did this off street? So much more painful than you could possibly imagine.

20
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:50,049
I didn't have that chainsaw. I tried to run to the chainsaw. I tried the submachine gun. You guys have no idea. This is actually attempt number like probably 70 or 80 in total.

21
00:14:23,070 --> 00:15:10,080
He has all the answers. Carly don't you're talking about that guy that took potshots at us with a sniper rifle, aren't you? Who take me to him? No, not now. He's injured and in no mood to talk to anyone. I'll bring him to you once he's recovered. I hope I don't die here. I can persuade him. I'm his little sister after all. Why should I trust you to bring him to me? The zombies are a message from Carlito.

22
00:15:11,629 --> 00:15:29,899
What does it say? He's saying, look at me.

23
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:36,299
Wait for us in the store next to the camera shop in the North Plaza.

24
00:15:39,419 --> 00:15:48,429
Why do you have gunner optics on? Those two not even remotely look like gunner optics. They're just like regular sunglasses.

25
00:15:56,409 --> 00:15:58,129
And I promise I'll come back.

26
00:15:58,129 --> 00:16:40,750
All right, I did it. And that case is done. Case number five coming up from 12 a.m. on September 21st. The next case will occur at 12 a.m., which is in like 40 minutes. Hey, and it's a promise to Isabella. You've already seen that because I cheated. Well, I didn't just where I stopped last time. I was like, all right, but let me paint you a picture. No, Don, no paintings. I got a I wouldn't even admit it. No, I can let me paint a picture for you.

27
00:16:41,070 --> 00:17:18,730
If I didn't like have a point where this was saved, and this was like I soft locked myself somehow. You know how angry I would have been? All right, I don't want to die. So that's important. So give me a board. I don't want to use my chance. So let's go. I only have to keep this timeline secure. I can I have to go here quick. I only have how long? Okay, I've got 30 minutes until I fail again.

28
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:19,730
Does somebody fuck with my screen brightness last night? All right, here we go. I have to go in here. And I need to be in here for the next 30 minutes. It's 12. All right. So welcome, everybody. Yeah, why is my screen brightness so low? Save the game? No, I can't because if I have to be here when this the clock strikes 12. I have to stay right here. Oh, it is my antique shop. I'm not going to be able to make that. Close the door. Can you close? Okay.

29
00:18:11,450 --> 00:19:01,029
I spotted a guy in the cosmetics shop in the entrance plaza. It looks like he's trying to get out of there. But someone's taking shots out of save the old man. Look at how much time there's left. That's like two minutes. No, I have to secure the timeline. I have in game. This amounts to like 45 seconds. Let's let's let's find out how long is 15 minutes in game? What? How long is 10 minutes in game? We can find this out. Okay, five seconds is one minute. There you go. I'm wasting time. No, I'm in the exact

30
00:19:01,029 --> 00:20:30,920
place I need to be. He's stalling. Whatever. That's fine. I ain't messing this up. Practice by swing. This is not the wrong store. I'm waiting. All right. It's almost midnight. And here we go. See? I told you I knew what I was doing. Zombie. Zombie. Oh, no, no, don't fuck it up. What? Okay. I know jokes that I don't have any time for that. If she dies, I have to do the whole thing again.

31
00:20:30,920 --> 00:21:34,180
Did I do that? You dislocated my shoulder and I'm missing seven teeth. Okay, this is where we go. Case five two engaged. Save the game. Do you wish to override a save? I do. Okay, so I'm gonna let's just go ahead and say just for the record, if I fail this, I have

32
00:21:34,180 --> 00:22:20,410
and I have a complete exit strategy. Understand? I was prepared. I wasn't fucking around today. So I'm gonna go up to the top. Number one. That looks good to me. Who cares? I have to do it. It is saved there. Number one. I have to get you somewhere safe. I never meant to shoot you. It's just like we never meant to shoot you. Can I give you anything? Can you take me out? No, you can't take anything. Can you? No, I just

33
00:22:20,410 --> 00:23:04,309
have to carry you, right? Let's go. And then I remember this. Hello, Kendall. It's nice to see another human being around here. Well, alive one at least. I have to put you down because it's just follow me. Let's go. You're looking for a place to meet real live people. I know a place. Nice Isabella. The security room safe. What am I supposed to do there? Be safe. Sitting around a locked room. We both have the same idea. There's a helicopter coming to get us. I

34
00:23:04,309 --> 00:23:43,420
why can't we just talk? Walk and talk. That's the one thing I don't understand. It's coming. I guarantee it. Trust me. All right, I suppose I could check this place out. Okay, good. You have a shotgun. So you need to be my you got to be my guy. He doesn't really aim very well from the cheating timeline. Let's go. You have to take the shots. In fact, just I can't command you because Isabella is on my back, but I need you to take some shots here. Very thank you. Keep going.

35
00:23:43,420 --> 00:24:37,029
This way. Go across the phone. Keep going. Come on. Go, go, go, go, go. Don't stop. Is this pre-recorded? No, if this is actually the pre-recorded one, I killed Kendall and took his shotgun. Because I just wasn't going to wait around for it. So this isn't this isn't a new timeline. Let's go. Shoot. You still with me? Jerma, say the word slime if it's not pre-recorded. It's not pre-recorded. What? How? When would I have the time to pre-record this? Can you imagine doing yesterday's stream?

36
00:24:37,029 --> 00:25:04,259
And then where am I going? Oh my god, I went the wrong fucking way. So after yesterday's stream, I just kept playing and then like what I just like pass out or something and just uploaded this. Yes. I have to take the shotgun from him before I deliver them to their destination.

37
00:25:04,259 --> 00:25:57,150
Face cam will prove recorded. It has not been 25 minutes yet. Yes, the stream has been live for 25 minutes, but I have not been playing the game for 25 minutes. So sorry. Shaking my head. S.M.H. Shaking my head. Come on, Kendall. Easy, easy, easy. Bait him out. Bait him out. Nice shooting. Actually not that good. This way. Get close enough where I can open the door. Close enough where I can open the door. All right, we're good. Keep it up. Hug the right side.

38
00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:54,539
Zombies on the right side. I need a shotgun shot right here. I need a shotgun blast right here. One more. One more. Another one. Another one. Shoot. Get back, back, back, back, back. No, no, no, no, no. Come here. Go. Don't get stuck. Kendall. Uh oh. Not good. Not good. I could use a chainsaw for this one. He's getting his ass kicked. Hold on. Stay there. Come on. Move. Keep going. Let's go. No. Why would you push me? Jokeless stream. It's going to stay that way until I am secure.

39
00:26:54,539 --> 00:27:46,380
And then I promise I'll tell you like a funny joke. This is not secure. I'm in the same timeline as I was before. This is incredibly, incredibly difficult. I remember reading on the forums, people saying the part where you have to transport Isabelle. Oh my God, man. It was so hard for me when I was 14. Because that person wrote that when they were 14 because it was in like 2006. All right, let's go up. Oh my God. This is the part. I read about this part. She doesn't get up. Come here. Dirk.

40
00:27:46,380 --> 00:28:37,420
You jerk. Almost there. Good. All right. Almost safe. Almost. I say that very, very loosely. Don't. Why? I saw that in slow motion. Okay. Shoot somebody. Just come to the door. Oh my God. Give me the shotgun. Okay. Now. Here. Do you want a nail gun? I'm telling you. You're better off with this. Give me that. Okay.

41
00:28:37,420 --> 00:29:34,480
Shoot me with it. You can walk, can't you? Just a little bit. I think she can walk. No. All right. Use that nail gun effectively, please. The reason I have the shotgun is because when the elevator door opens, I need to make sure it is clear. Thank you. Good. Nice. You're much better. You're more of a precision guy than a just launch weapon guy. All right. Let's go. Isabelle, come on. Come on, Kindle. Okay. This is important. Important. I don't know why I thought that was a zombie.

42
00:29:34,480 --> 00:30:25,750
All right. This is here we go. Over here. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't give that back. Get that back. You stand right here. Give that back. This is it. One, two, three. And got that. This is that was a stressful part because look at the time. Okay. Well, now let's talk about something funny. Where's that fucking content?

43
00:30:31,269 --> 00:30:34,980
Webcams are not even plugged in.

44
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:52,940
I don't want to plug it in. My crashed computer. Not enough like bus spaces on the motherboard. It'll crash.

45
00:31:11,819 --> 00:31:23,299
Okay. There were some nonbelievers here that didn't think I was going to do it.

46
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:34,109
I stayed in the post stream chat last night and I saw somebody wrote a paragraph and they were like, he's not going to be able to do this guys. He's going to be kind of upset about this. He's going to be like pissed off.

47
00:31:35,109 --> 00:31:51,990
Should we need to tell him that he can't do it? And then I stayed up for four extra hours and didn't case five complete case six starts at three a.m.

48
00:31:51,990 --> 00:32:12,849
I got a couple of hours. Done. 50,000 pp. 21 sounds familiar. Doesn't it? Take a photo of them. Got it. I got to make. Wait, hold. Very important. Now the timeline is actually secure.

49
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:22,289
I need to go to the picture viewer. Save that one. That's a good one. All right. I need to save some of these pants is still there. Okay.

50
00:32:22,289 --> 00:32:47,450
Okay. But like the rock bottom off the Titan Tron is like perfect, but I don't think this one is. I can get, I'm going to get rid of this one. Keep pants. No, this was just like weird. I like that one. Okay.

51
00:32:52,250 --> 00:33:07,190
Why? Okay. Wait, this one too. When he's running, that's a good one. That one. Never forget Ronald and the fat lady. Which one's better though? Yeah, that was pretty good.

52
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:39,440
They're both good. That one's not that good. All right. I think I'm good. Where's the pants photo? It's right here. I'm okay with that. So now I got a little bit of time here. I can photographer surprise. Do I have? Okay.

53
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:47,440
Three a.m. I have just about one hour, which is like 20 minutes game time at 15 minutes game time, something like that. Do I have enough time to do it? Save it first.

54
00:33:47,440 --> 00:34:16,539
I wonder if there's enough time to be back here in 15 minutes. Change slot. This is going to be now. This is the real one. So this is slot two. Okay, sick. I don't know why I just thought this had game sucks. When it got to the first see, I'm like, what the fuck is going on?

55
00:34:17,539 --> 00:34:45,750
All right, photographers pride. I need to be. Let's see if I can get there. I have a good shotgun. Explore the roof where the elevator is. I'll do that. Well, there's a button there. Okay, what about this way?

56
00:34:46,750 --> 00:35:09,860
So explore the roof. Anything up here? Face cam. Now it's been 25 minutes. That's not true because I've I had to rewind two or three times in different safe slots. So we've only been like 17 or 18 minutes on the real actual game.

57
00:35:09,860 --> 00:36:00,989
Anything over here? I don't see anything this way. Can I get up on top of the roof? I feel like I can get up there. Hmm. He hates his viewers. He's just finding right now this out. MonkaS. I'm sorry, I could do that better. MonkaS. I can't just stand this up. I can't jump up that. Slime him. I don't think I can do anything about this.

58
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:28,340
Warehouse. I'll take the call. It's kind of weird, but there's a group of freaks and raincoats gathered in Colby's movie land. They're wearing matching masks, too. And they're really giving me the creeps. I've noticed I already know who these people are. I noticed stop calling me on my novelty soccer ball phone.

59
00:36:28,340 --> 00:37:21,889
I've been up here before, but I mean, they're the toolbox. What can I do with the toolbox? Anything cool? Fuck it. Wait, what was in there? Sawz? Ooh, that's cool. Sludge hammer. Soccer ball. I'll keep the soccer ball for like a funny moment. Keep the oops. Well, I got to be back here anyways. I can do photography sprite again in a little bit. There are actually sawz here though. All right, sawz. Get off of me. Yeah. Okay. You know how some things in games.

60
00:37:22,889 --> 00:38:19,150
Just something about them. The way they happen. The animation and the damage. For some reason, the you get grabbed and bit by a zombie just makes me angry. It's just every time it happens, I'm just like, fuck out of here. Soccer ball. What was that? What was that noise? You guys hear that? That little like, yeah, I'm just gonna get back up here. A strange group. I still have time. All right.

61
00:38:19,150 --> 00:39:19,500
Do I have any supplies? Let me have a couple. I have a squash. Just eat it. My supplies aren't bad. You didn't do anything. Well, I just, I checked out the, somebody said, check out the roof. You can't really do anything in like 10 minutes. All I can do is sit here. Check out the roof again. I know I can, I have to be back here in like six, I have to be here in like five minutes. It takes five minutes to go down the elevator and like out the door. It's been 25. Caving. The definition of the word cave. A small dugout.

62
00:39:19,500 --> 00:40:35,010
On clove. Inside of a rock. Making a dark, damp space. Other definition. Being forced to turn on your face cam on twitch.tv. Verb. I don't even know where this is. I have like wicked bad villain here today too, so you guys will love that. Okay. I just have to wait here. It's desynced. What do you want to do about it? All right. It shouldn't be desynced anymore. Patrick Bateman.

63
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:45,079
Why is my water wicked cloudy? Do you see this? Look at this. It's really cloudy.

64
00:40:54,659 --> 00:40:57,659
Tastes like the lime juice I squeezed in it.

65
00:41:09,659 --> 00:41:11,659
MDMA water?

66
00:41:29,929 --> 00:41:32,170
Wait, Dr. Barnaby is going to be turned.

67
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:36,610
Oh wait, no, he's just normal.

68
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:41,489
Shotgun head. Shotgun head. Shotgun head.

69
00:41:57,769 --> 00:42:00,769
I did go kind of all the way to the end there. Like shotgun head?

70
00:42:00,769 --> 00:42:05,019
You could kick him.

71
00:42:06,019 --> 00:42:17,769
Shotgun head. No, shotgun. This is not good. Now you gotta listen to me.

72
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:20,769
Dude, shut. No, shotgun head. I think I was right.

73
00:42:21,769 --> 00:42:27,679
Stop drinking bong water.

74
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:38,539
I'm not drinking bong water.

75
00:42:54,130 --> 00:43:03,659
Yes. Dishwater soap. You guys are going to come up with all these ideas.

76
00:43:05,659 --> 00:43:18,889
Why is he, he's got like these like golem, the cryptkeeper eyes right now.

77
00:43:28,019 --> 00:43:36,739
Accidentally made zombie livestock.

78
00:43:37,739 --> 00:43:49,860
Get it out, Doc. Come on.

79
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,360
So the government's now in the zombie making business.

80
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,360
The whole story about the drug trade was a cover-up.

81
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,360
What do you know?

82
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:03,360
If I'm like dying or turning or if like something's happening, I'm going to say everything as fast as I can.

83
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,920
Because what if you died?

84
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:11,480
I would give you, I would say, I would even have heard, I'd scream as loud as I could.

85
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,480
It's true.

86
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:21,440
It's true.

87
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:38,980
At this point you're acting, you know what I mean?

88
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:43,349
You could be like, the research was necessary.

89
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:48,719
We had to do it because everyone's eating too much meat and we're trying to, we just.

90
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:54,719
That so is absolutely necessary.

91
00:44:55,719 --> 00:44:56,719
No, you would get it out as fast as you could.

92
00:44:57,719 --> 00:45:09,860
And then you'd be like, the antidote's in the fridge, in the fridge in the upstairs bathroom.

93
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:11,860
The fridge in the upstairs bathroom. Get the antidote.

94
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:14,289
Why do they make it so cryptic?

95
00:45:15,289 --> 00:45:20,289
The only way you'll ever survive is if you find the cure that I've hidden.

96
00:45:21,289 --> 00:45:22,289
Just tell them, like tell them.

97
00:45:23,289 --> 00:45:24,289
Where is the antidote? You know where it is. Just say it.

98
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:26,289
Just say it to the, just say it to his face.

99
00:45:26,289 --> 00:45:27,289
Just get it out.

100
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:33,190
If I'm ever in a position where it's like a zombie apocalypse and I know where something is.

101
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:35,750
Everyone's going to know.

102
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:39,119
That would be bad though because it would be like a huge fight to get to the antidote.

103
00:45:40,119 --> 00:45:47,860
How much antidote? Why do they always make one like vial?

104
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:53,409
Why don't you make like fucking 75 gallons of the antidote?

105
00:45:54,409 --> 00:45:55,409
Why is it in a vial this big?

106
00:46:01,059 --> 00:46:04,059
Is this like my like coping mechanism to be like, I'm in the camera?

107
00:46:05,059 --> 00:46:06,059
Okay.

108
00:46:07,369 --> 00:46:08,369
That was fucked.

109
00:46:23,179 --> 00:46:24,179
It had to have gone through my head too.

110
00:46:24,179 --> 00:46:28,179
The camera is going to just fall forward and it's going to be a bullet through my head.

111
00:46:29,179 --> 00:46:33,170
There's no way that goes straight.

112
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:35,170
The lens is an indicator.

113
00:46:41,079 --> 00:46:43,079
The terrorism is a retaliation for a cruel government cover-up.

114
00:46:48,159 --> 00:46:49,159
Sounds plausible.

115
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:52,460
Or it could be some serious bullshit in either case.

116
00:46:53,699 --> 00:46:54,699
We have to get out of here alive.

117
00:46:58,570 --> 00:46:59,570
Where's my bomb?

118
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:01,570
We have to check if she's been bitten. Let me take a look.

119
00:47:02,869 --> 00:47:03,869
Oh, she's been bitten many times. I've seen it.

120
00:47:04,869 --> 00:47:06,869
I'm a medical technician. I could be useful if you let me do my job.

121
00:47:06,869 --> 00:47:08,869
I've watched her get bit like at least a dozen times.

122
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:13,869
I know I have no right to ask, but please let me help.

123
00:47:14,869 --> 00:47:20,380
If you don't get out of here, the truth dies with you.

124
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:33,019
Why is that always the stance when somebody's lying on the ground and sitting on the ground?

125
00:47:34,019 --> 00:47:35,019
They do this.

126
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:39,019
They put their knees up like this and they go like this.

127
00:47:40,019 --> 00:47:41,019
It's in every game.

128
00:47:43,349 --> 00:47:46,349
The knees up, legs to the side and like the arm here.

129
00:47:46,349 --> 00:47:47,349
This is not comfortable.

130
00:47:48,349 --> 00:47:50,230
What do you mean it's comfy? No, it's not.

131
00:47:51,230 --> 00:47:52,730
Sit like that.

132
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:54,730
Lean against a wall.

133
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:56,730
That's not comfortable.

134
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:05,820
Why don't you just sit against the wall like this or like this?

135
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:07,820
With your arms like this.

136
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:09,820
Or fetal position.

137
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:14,380
It's like you're about to go to fetal position, but you're like stopping halfway for some reason.

138
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:16,380
I don't know why.

139
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:26,469
The game crashed.

140
00:48:27,469 --> 00:48:30,570
Next case will occur at 11 a.m.

141
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:36,650
Here we go. Let's just save it.

142
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:38,650
Maybe in that same slot right here.

143
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:40,650
Right here.

144
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:46,730
All right. Now I get time.

145
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:48,730
A strange group. I got plenty of time now.

146
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:50,730
Timeline secured. We're safe.

147
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:53,349
Let's go to a strange group.

148
00:48:54,349 --> 00:49:03,400
It's free roam time.

149
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,400
What was the intel on this one?

150
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:12,500
I need to get food too.

151
00:49:14,510 --> 00:49:15,510
You're in the worst spot.

152
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:23,500
Save? I just did.

153
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:25,500
The game just saved.

154
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,630
Oh, I could do the gun shop too.

155
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:30,630
Where is the strange group?

156
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:32,630
Remember I walked in the gun shop and there was that weirdo in there?

157
00:49:34,449 --> 00:49:36,710
All right. Here's the plan.

158
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:40,889
The plan is to do the skip.

159
00:49:42,889 --> 00:49:44,130
Where's the strange group?

160
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:46,130
I don't remember what it said.

161
00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:48,500
All right. I'm going to get the chainsaw.

162
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:50,500
And then I'm going to go up to the gun store.

163
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:52,500
And then I'm going to come back down.

164
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:07,920
Give me the sledgehammer.

165
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:12,530
All right.

166
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:17,139
So now I'll get chainsaw.

167
00:50:18,139 --> 00:50:19,139
I need to have this. This is important.

168
00:50:20,139 --> 00:50:21,139
When I don't have the chainsaw, I do not feel safe.

169
00:50:22,139 --> 00:50:23,820
I got plenty of time.

170
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:24,820
I got a lot of time to run around.

171
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:32,699
Let's go.

172
00:50:34,579 --> 00:50:35,579
Oops.

173
00:50:36,579 --> 00:50:37,579
No.

174
00:50:38,579 --> 00:50:39,579
You all did the same move at the same time.

175
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:48,070
All right. Fuck it. Just leave them.

176
00:50:49,070 --> 00:50:51,849
Oh, that felt good.

177
00:50:52,849 --> 00:50:53,849
Stringer.

178
00:50:54,849 --> 00:50:55,849
Check out Dead Rising 2.

179
00:50:56,849 --> 00:50:57,849
I've actually played Dead Rising 2 in co-op, but we didn't make it out of the elevator, I don't think.

180
00:50:58,849 --> 00:50:59,849
I don't remember playing that game past the elevator.

181
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:01,849
Me and Star played it.

182
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:04,340
I don't know.

183
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:06,340
I have no idea.

184
00:51:08,099 --> 00:51:09,099
I think we didn't get out of the tutorial room.

185
00:51:10,099 --> 00:51:11,099
Let's go to the point there.

186
00:51:12,099 --> 00:51:14,170
I could go to the gun store.

187
00:51:15,170 --> 00:51:16,170
Movie Plaza is...

188
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:18,920
It was like the actual movie plaza.

189
00:51:20,099 --> 00:51:21,099
Paradise Plaza.

190
00:51:22,099 --> 00:51:23,099
All right. I'm going to go up from here.

191
00:51:24,099 --> 00:51:25,099
I'm going to save it. I'm going to go to the gun store.

192
00:51:28,769 --> 00:51:29,769
I think that's a good idea.

193
00:51:35,739 --> 00:51:36,739
So it was this way, right?

194
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:40,570
Yes.

195
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:45,880
Question marks of scoops.

196
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:47,880
All right. Well, that's fine.

197
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:50,500
I got to get guns.

198
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:52,500
I don't want handguns.

199
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:54,500
I don't want handguns.

200
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,280
It won't take long.

201
00:52:05,219 --> 00:52:06,219
Like this is not a gun.

202
00:52:07,219 --> 00:52:10,630
This thing sucks.

203
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:12,809
This is fun to shoot.

204
00:52:13,809 --> 00:52:14,809
And did I pass it?

205
00:52:15,809 --> 00:52:16,809
I did. God damn it.

206
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:27,690
This is what happens when I just walk and talk.

207
00:52:30,659 --> 00:52:31,659
Eat boogers. Eat boogers.

208
00:52:33,539 --> 00:52:34,539
Wait, what the hell am I doing?

209
00:52:35,539 --> 00:52:40,739
No, no, go back.

210
00:52:41,739 --> 00:52:42,739
I'm just saving the game in here.

211
00:52:43,739 --> 00:52:44,739
Not going all the way back.

212
00:52:45,739 --> 00:52:48,519
Eat boogers.

213
00:52:49,519 --> 00:52:51,460
I'm trying to like navigate.

214
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:53,460
Imagine you were driving somewhere

215
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:55,460
Eat boogers. Eat your boogers.

216
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:57,460
Eat your boogers. You're going to miss your exit.

217
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:00,789
All right. It's happening again.

218
00:53:01,789 --> 00:53:09,179
All right. Straight up.

219
00:53:10,179 --> 00:53:13,139
Just don't read.

220
00:53:14,139 --> 00:53:15,139
That's true. That's a good idea.

221
00:53:16,139 --> 00:53:17,139
But it's compulsive. I have to look over here.

222
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:21,300
What did I just do?

223
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:23,300
I did not want to pick that guy up in like a fucking scoop slam.

224
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:25,610
And now I have no help.

225
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:33,590
This is great.

226
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:35,590
Is there any? There's a grocery store right here.

227
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:37,590
I'm going to hit up the grocery store

228
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,590
and then the back this way to the gun.

229
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:41,590
And then we'll go from there.

230
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:49,780
I don't want to use this yet.

231
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:51,780
I also want to get a book for this thing.

232
00:53:53,409 --> 00:53:54,409
For the chainsaw.

233
00:53:55,409 --> 00:53:56,409
It's the tools book.

234
00:53:57,409 --> 00:53:58,409
So I got to go to the bookstore too.

235
00:53:59,409 --> 00:54:00,409
Eventually I got time.

236
00:54:04,849 --> 00:54:05,849
I don't need to rush.

237
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:08,340
Pause for the special moves.

238
00:54:11,309 --> 00:54:17,480
I can't. I don't have any time to pause.

239
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:20,489
What?

240
00:54:22,369 --> 00:54:23,369
I have a motorcycle now.

241
00:54:24,369 --> 00:54:25,369
All right. This is important.

242
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:29,530
I need to eat a bunch of food to fill up.

243
00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:31,530
I can ride the motorcycle.

244
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:34,019
All right. Is there any like orange juice?

245
00:54:35,019 --> 00:54:36,019
Is it better food here?

246
00:54:37,019 --> 00:54:38,019
Besides just the junk on the shelves?

247
00:54:39,019 --> 00:54:40,780
I don't want to eat melons.

248
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:42,780
I mean I will, but I don't want to.

249
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:45,269
Queen?

250
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:47,900
Shit. Where?

251
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:55,960
Right there.

252
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:01,460
Give me the queen.

253
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:08,440
Oh God. It's.

254
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,829
Are you all just standing on it? Where is it?

255
00:55:12,829 --> 00:55:13,829
Where's my indicator?

256
00:55:14,829 --> 00:55:19,849
Where's the fucking queen?

257
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:23,989
Get it!

258
00:55:24,989 --> 00:55:26,869
All right. Frozen food aisle.

259
00:55:29,969 --> 00:55:31,909
Two queens.

260
00:55:32,909 --> 00:55:35,880
Can I eat frozen pizza?

261
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:40,619
Oh, I can eat uncooked pizza.

262
00:55:41,619 --> 00:55:44,199
How much does it heal?

263
00:55:45,199 --> 00:55:46,199
Only two.

264
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:48,500
Oh, I'm so sick of you motherfuckers.

265
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:53,500
I swear to God.

266
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:56,309
Get the fuck away from me.

267
00:55:57,309 --> 00:55:59,829
All right. I'm going to eat.

268
00:56:00,829 --> 00:56:03,099
I'm going to take.

269
00:56:05,869 --> 00:56:06,869
Get rid of this.

270
00:56:07,869 --> 00:56:08,869
Two uncooked pizzas.

271
00:56:10,179 --> 00:56:11,179
That should be all right for a little bit.

272
00:56:12,179 --> 00:56:13,179
Wait, is there wine here?

273
00:56:14,179 --> 00:56:16,440
Chat, tell them about the wine.

274
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:20,900
Condiments?

275
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:24,090
Meats?

276
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:26,090
It just triggers an automatic hatred response.

277
00:56:27,090 --> 00:56:28,090
Back here?

278
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:34,550
I don't want to use this though.

279
00:56:35,550 --> 00:56:36,730
I don't want to overuse this.

280
00:56:37,730 --> 00:56:38,730
Oh, fuck. There is wine back here.

281
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:47,429
Holy shit. Okay.

282
00:56:53,659 --> 00:56:54,659
Get rid of this too.

283
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:07,079
One, two, three.

284
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:09,079
Three wines.

285
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:11,079
Three wines, chainsaw, shotgun.

286
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:13,079
Two queens.

287
00:57:15,090 --> 00:57:16,090
Let's go.

288
00:57:17,090 --> 00:57:18,780
Why am I taking my eyes off the exit?

289
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:20,780
Curse.

290
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:23,210
Where I'm just like, all right, I got it.

291
00:57:25,219 --> 00:57:26,219
It happened.

292
00:57:27,219 --> 00:57:34,090
I'm in my demonstration.

293
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:37,610
Okay, I'm good.

294
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:39,610
You hate streaming.

295
00:57:40,610 --> 00:57:41,610
No, get off.

296
00:57:42,610 --> 00:57:44,170
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

297
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:48,780
I need a safe point.

298
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:50,780
Can I ride this?

299
00:57:52,530 --> 00:57:53,530
How do I ride it?

300
00:57:59,059 --> 00:58:00,059
Okay, it's right trigger.

301
00:58:01,809 --> 00:58:11,179
This is so fast.

302
00:58:12,179 --> 00:58:13,610
All right, hold on.

303
00:58:14,610 --> 00:58:22,440
Wait, wait, wait.

304
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:24,440
Which is this way.

305
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,440
Gunshot. So come out here.

306
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:28,440
Bang it left.

307
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:30,440
Straight down the little narrow hall.

308
00:58:44,099 --> 00:58:45,099
You got it.

309
00:58:46,099 --> 00:58:47,099
Okay, down here.

310
00:58:48,099 --> 00:58:54,329
No, wrong narrow hall.

311
00:58:56,139 --> 00:58:57,139
A little bit further.

312
00:58:58,449 --> 00:59:14,980
Where is it?

313
00:59:16,349 --> 00:59:17,349
Fucking missed it.

314
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:22,199
Oh, God.

315
00:59:23,760 --> 01:00:03,849
Hello?

316
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:09,030
Hello?

317
01:00:11,619 --> 01:00:12,619
Not the same guy in there.

318
01:00:13,619 --> 01:00:14,619
I took a lot of bullets though.

319
01:00:15,619 --> 01:00:16,619
I took hundreds of bullets into my body.

320
01:00:17,619 --> 01:00:19,750
Why would they do that?

321
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:21,750
So I'm not going in there.

322
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:29,300
I'm not going in here.

323
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:33,460
You have to shoot them from outside the store.

324
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:35,460
It's impossible.

325
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:37,460
Wait, hold on.

326
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:42,780
What did you say?

327
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:50,650
It's this one, right?

328
01:00:51,650 --> 01:00:52,820
So I'm going to use the shotgun.

329
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:56,920
Where's the motorcycle?

330
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:58,920
I didn't walk by it, right?

331
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:05,940
Where's the motorcycle?

332
01:01:09,489 --> 01:01:10,489
It drove off.

333
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:15,590
Instant fucking anger every time.

334
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:35,239
He's going to grab me.

335
01:01:36,239 --> 01:01:37,420
Okay.

336
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:39,420
Here we go.

337
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:41,420
Down this way.

338
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:44,099
So you tell me I have to, I can't go in here.

339
01:01:45,099 --> 01:01:46,099
Well, there's zombies everywhere.

340
01:01:47,099 --> 01:01:56,730
What if I have the gun ready?

341
01:02:00,019 --> 01:02:01,019
Will that make a difference?

342
01:02:03,150 --> 01:02:04,150
Look at how many people are out here.

343
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:06,150
This is like fucking ridiculous.

344
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:10,760
What?

345
01:02:20,449 --> 01:03:02,199
These guys aren't affected?

346
01:03:03,199 --> 01:03:04,630
It's like, guys?

347
01:03:05,630 --> 01:03:08,090
What do you mean, Alyssa defected?

348
01:03:09,090 --> 01:03:11,159
She already was defected.

349
01:03:12,159 --> 01:03:13,159
She's fucking killing me.

350
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:18,340
I'm so confused.

351
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:20,340
What do you mean, she's friendly?

352
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:23,929
What do you mean, wrong one?

353
01:03:24,929 --> 01:03:31,989
Get me out of the store.

354
01:03:32,989 --> 01:04:04,380
Out of the store.

355
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:06,380
He's shooting.

356
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:08,380
Why can it stun lock?

357
01:04:10,699 --> 01:04:26,219
What the fuck?

358
01:04:27,219 --> 01:04:37,480
Hello, anybody in here?

359
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,550
What?

360
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:46,760
Read this.

361
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:50,199
That was inhuman.

362
01:04:53,230 --> 01:04:54,230
What if I walk away?

363
01:04:55,230 --> 01:04:56,980
Will he see me and run out?

364
01:04:57,980 --> 01:05:01,019
I have to do it again.

365
01:05:02,019 --> 01:05:03,019
I have to do it again.

366
01:05:04,699 --> 01:05:07,739
Holy fuck, I just annihilated him.

367
01:05:08,739 --> 01:05:14,969
What is he doing?

368
01:05:15,969 --> 01:05:16,969
Where's my chainsaw?

369
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:40,780
No, I need to be behind him.

370
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:54,599
What's going on?

371
01:05:57,179 --> 01:05:58,179
What do you mean, he defected?

372
01:05:59,420 --> 01:06:00,420
What?

373
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:03,880
Oh, the sign's gone.

374
01:06:05,309 --> 01:06:06,309
New sign, I need a new sign.

375
01:06:27,969 --> 01:06:28,969
Like a dad playing.

376
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:39,829
Just kill me so I can do it again.

377
01:06:40,829 --> 01:06:41,829
It's physically impossible to go in the store.

378
01:06:41,829 --> 01:06:42,829
So, shoot them from the outside.

379
01:06:43,829 --> 01:06:44,829
I'm going to run out of ammo.

380
01:06:45,829 --> 01:06:46,829
This guy just stun locked me forever.

381
01:06:47,829 --> 01:06:50,159
They're friendly.

382
01:06:51,159 --> 01:06:52,159
I walked in and they fucking started shooting at me.

383
01:06:53,159 --> 01:06:59,010
Go in and go out.

384
01:07:00,010 --> 01:07:07,780
I scared them?

385
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:09,780
Because I'm holding the fucking chainsaw?

386
01:07:17,159 --> 01:07:18,159
Kill the crowd outside.

387
01:07:22,730 --> 01:07:23,730
We're going this way.

388
01:07:24,730 --> 01:07:35,179
Yes, we are.

389
01:07:36,179 --> 01:07:37,179
To be fair, you're barefoot and running around with the chainsaw.

390
01:07:40,469 --> 01:07:41,469
But there's zombies everywhere.

391
01:07:42,469 --> 01:07:50,880
This is not out of the ordinary.

392
01:07:53,719 --> 01:07:54,719
I'm going to kill the crowd outside.

393
01:07:58,710 --> 01:07:59,710
I don't want to use all this though.

394
01:08:01,719 --> 01:08:02,719
It's the only thing I fucking have.

395
01:08:06,260 --> 01:08:07,260
Plus, it's a gun shop, so I should be okay.

396
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:22,539
What?

397
01:08:23,539 --> 01:08:24,539
Usually there's like all the raincoat guys out here.

398
01:08:25,539 --> 01:08:40,180
Dude, for being shitty zombies, they sure can hold the fuck on.

399
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:48,539
Like they lumber around like they have no idea where they're going.

400
01:08:49,539 --> 01:08:54,539
But they have these like fucking like landscaper hands to just like grab onto it.

401
01:09:10,369 --> 01:09:12,569
I have alcohol.

402
01:09:13,569 --> 01:09:19,100
Here he comes.

403
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:31,369
Brett, here comes another one.

404
01:09:31,369 --> 01:09:41,380
Are you breathing?

405
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:43,380
I wasn't supposed to know that was going to happen.

406
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:49,840
There's a helicopter coming.

407
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:55,729
It'll be here on Friday.

408
01:09:56,729 --> 01:10:02,699
I thought you might want to ride.

409
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:04,699
Where is it supposed to land?

410
01:10:08,119 --> 01:10:09,119
There's zombies everywhere.

411
01:10:10,119 --> 01:10:11,119
And a heliport on the roof.

412
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:14,380
Just fall away.

413
01:10:15,380 --> 01:10:16,380
But the security room is sealed tight.

414
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:18,380
A dead end.

415
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:20,560
I saw it.

416
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:22,560
I know what I saw.

417
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:24,560
There's a duct on the roof of Paradise Plaza.

418
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:27,250
I just gave everybody all the info, huh?

419
01:10:30,279 --> 01:10:31,279
Okay, so.

420
01:10:32,279 --> 01:10:33,279
What? What happened?

421
01:10:34,279 --> 01:10:35,279
What the fuck is going on?

422
01:10:36,279 --> 01:10:38,739
What do you mean kill it?

423
01:10:39,739 --> 01:10:41,869
What the fuck was that?

424
01:10:42,869 --> 01:10:43,869
Not that I trust you completely, man.

425
01:10:44,869 --> 01:10:46,689
What do you think?

426
01:10:47,689 --> 01:10:48,689
Why do they stop talking?

427
01:10:49,689 --> 01:10:50,689
You heard the man.

428
01:10:51,689 --> 01:10:53,310
Let's firing squad him again.

429
01:10:54,310 --> 01:10:55,310
Can I talk?

430
01:10:56,310 --> 01:10:57,310
Go find your duct and take a picture of it with the camera you got.

431
01:10:58,310 --> 01:11:02,109
Then we can talk.

432
01:11:03,670 --> 01:11:04,670
Okay.

433
01:11:05,670 --> 01:11:13,060
What a waste of fucking time.

434
01:11:14,739 --> 01:11:17,460
Come on, buddy.

435
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:19,460
PP sticker.

436
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:21,460
Alright, so I have to come back with a photo of the duct.

437
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:28,180
This thing is almost empty.

438
01:11:29,859 --> 01:11:30,859
Well, I have to go back to...

439
01:11:31,859 --> 01:11:33,100
I'm going to go back to Paradise.

440
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:36,100
So I have to leave out here and just go through the plaza.

441
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:41,739
See if I have time to do this still.

442
01:11:42,739 --> 01:11:44,100
I'm just going to heal.

443
01:11:45,859 --> 01:11:51,550
I only have the shotgun and the one hit left on this.

444
01:11:52,550 --> 01:11:53,550
I don't really want to use it.

445
01:11:55,109 --> 01:11:56,109
Just give me a shitty weapon.

446
01:11:57,109 --> 01:12:02,899
Like something around.

447
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:05,520
We're on our way.

448
01:12:12,310 --> 01:12:13,310
I hear somebody crying.

449
01:12:14,310 --> 01:12:16,449
Who's crying?

450
01:12:24,020 --> 01:12:25,020
You hear that?

451
01:12:26,020 --> 01:12:29,310
In the store?

452
01:12:30,310 --> 01:12:33,539
Somebody in here?

453
01:12:35,989 --> 01:12:36,989
I heard somebody crying.

454
01:12:37,989 --> 01:12:41,729
Is there nobody in here?

455
01:12:42,729 --> 01:12:43,729
This is like a hardware store though.

456
01:12:48,550 --> 01:12:49,550
Anybody here?

457
01:12:57,899 --> 01:13:02,909
What is this thing doing?

458
01:13:07,670 --> 01:13:08,670
Nobody?

459
01:13:09,670 --> 01:13:13,020
This is a sick fuck.

460
01:13:14,020 --> 01:13:15,020
I don't think anyone was there.

461
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:17,020
This is a weed whacker?

462
01:13:20,890 --> 01:13:21,890
What is this?

463
01:13:25,050 --> 01:13:26,050
Is someone there?

464
01:13:27,050 --> 01:13:28,050
Hello?

465
01:13:29,479 --> 01:13:30,479
I wouldn't trust this person.

466
01:13:39,270 --> 01:13:40,270
Hold on, there's a photo.

467
01:13:44,970 --> 01:13:52,670
That's a horrible photo.

468
01:13:53,670 --> 01:13:54,670
Let's get a close up.

469
01:13:58,340 --> 01:14:00,159
I don't think there's anything in here for me.

470
01:14:01,909 --> 01:14:03,220
Anything in the box?

471
01:14:04,220 --> 01:14:07,180
Well, that's a fire axe.

472
01:14:08,180 --> 01:14:09,180
That seems pretty great actually.

473
01:14:10,180 --> 01:14:13,149
What's in the box over here?

474
01:14:23,670 --> 01:14:31,250
It's actually kind of slow.

475
01:14:32,250 --> 01:14:33,250
Chainsaw.

476
01:14:34,250 --> 01:14:37,149
There's so much shit in here.

477
01:14:37,149 --> 01:14:40,149
If Hansen made it out of fucking fly paper.

478
01:14:41,149 --> 01:14:42,970
You know what?

479
01:14:43,970 --> 01:14:44,970
All of you fuck off.

480
01:14:45,970 --> 01:14:46,970
Just do it.

481
01:14:53,649 --> 01:14:57,640
What's over here?

482
01:14:58,640 --> 01:14:59,640
Tool box.

483
01:15:02,289 --> 01:15:05,319
I want to get the thing that's up there.

484
01:15:07,579 --> 01:15:08,579
What the hell is that?

485
01:15:09,579 --> 01:15:10,579
Japanese radish.

486
01:15:13,229 --> 01:15:14,789
Why is it up here?

487
01:15:15,789 --> 01:15:16,789
I can't go in here?

488
01:15:20,659 --> 01:15:21,659
Why not?

489
01:15:22,899 --> 01:15:23,899
Use the Japanese radish?

490
01:15:24,899 --> 01:15:26,329
I don't think I can.

491
01:15:27,329 --> 01:15:28,329
I'm starting to get to yellow.

492
01:15:29,630 --> 01:15:31,630
Is there anymore axes or something I can grab on the way out?

493
01:15:32,630 --> 01:15:33,939
I guess I could take...

494
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:36,560
Is it a pickaxe? Can I take it?

495
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:38,560
No, a sledgehammer.

496
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:40,560
What do I want to replace?

497
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:43,760
Just get rid of the radish.

498
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:44,760
What am I going to use this for?

499
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:45,760
I'll take a sledgehammer.

500
01:15:51,479 --> 01:15:55,020
I'm out.

501
01:15:55,020 --> 01:16:20,010
I can't take it outside.

502
01:16:26,180 --> 01:16:27,180
Oh, they're back.

503
01:16:32,510 --> 01:16:33,510
When was the last time I saved the fucking game?

504
01:16:35,710 --> 01:16:36,710
They're all the way down there.

505
01:16:37,710 --> 01:16:38,710
I'm going to paradise though.

506
01:16:43,659 --> 01:16:44,659
I have to go over here.

507
01:16:49,170 --> 01:16:50,170
Damn it.

508
01:16:50,170 --> 01:16:51,170
Now I'm going to have to cross that path.

509
01:16:52,170 --> 01:16:58,140
They aren't that hard.

510
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:00,380
Well, how many shots do I have in my shotgun?

511
01:17:01,380 --> 01:17:02,380
I don't think I have very many.

512
01:17:04,649 --> 01:17:05,649
Use the scoot.

513
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:08,140
The scoot.

514
01:17:10,279 --> 01:17:11,279
Can I just sneak up behind them and shoot the guy in the head with the shotgun?

515
01:17:12,279 --> 01:17:14,670
Will that work?

516
01:17:16,869 --> 01:17:17,869
I haven't saved in a while. I'm not going to try it.

517
01:17:20,199 --> 01:17:21,199
I'll come out here after I save.

518
01:17:22,199 --> 01:17:23,199
I have to make sure I can do that.

519
01:17:24,199 --> 01:17:31,180
Let's do this first while there's still time to do it.

520
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:42,420
Okay.

521
01:17:42,420 --> 01:17:43,420
So now it's just over here.

522
01:17:43,420 --> 01:17:44,729
A strange group.

523
01:17:45,729 --> 01:17:48,760
I think I found him.

524
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:56,890
What the fuck was that?

525
01:17:57,890 --> 01:18:06,619
Get away from me.

526
01:18:06,619 --> 01:18:07,619
No, get away from me with your explosions.

527
01:18:08,619 --> 01:18:12,609
Give me that card.

528
01:18:13,609 --> 01:18:21,500
There's food over here.

529
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:22,500
Put that down.

530
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:26,050
Hamburgers and shit, right?

531
01:18:29,979 --> 01:18:30,979
No, it's just condiments.

532
01:18:30,979 --> 01:18:31,979
Baking ingredients.

533
01:18:31,979 --> 01:18:32,979
I don't have any food in here.

534
01:18:32,979 --> 01:18:33,979
How do you not have food in this restaurant?

535
01:18:42,449 --> 01:18:43,449
Ronald ate at so every other.

536
01:18:43,449 --> 01:18:44,449
That's right.

537
01:18:44,449 --> 01:18:45,449
Okay, let's go.

538
01:18:47,899 --> 01:18:48,899
I still have a full heal.

539
01:18:48,899 --> 01:18:49,899
Movie land.

540
01:19:16,420 --> 01:19:17,420
What's up motherfuckers?

541
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:29,159
See what?

542
01:19:32,579 --> 01:19:33,579
Save at the bathroom.

543
01:19:36,220 --> 01:19:38,220
Those who reject salvation.

544
01:19:39,220 --> 01:19:44,109
Embrace ignorance.

545
01:19:46,949 --> 01:19:47,949
I got a shotgun.

546
01:19:47,949 --> 01:19:53,159
I'll kill him.

547
01:19:53,159 --> 01:19:54,159
This boss is really annoying.

548
01:19:54,159 --> 01:19:55,159
Don't tell me that.

549
01:19:55,159 --> 01:19:59,550
Don't tell me that I'm going to go back to where I was saved in the North Plaza.

550
01:20:03,930 --> 01:20:10,050
Now I shall return your tainted blood.

551
01:20:11,050 --> 01:20:13,989
Foul earth that has spawned you.

552
01:20:16,130 --> 01:20:17,130
Just shotgun.

553
01:20:17,130 --> 01:20:27,460
I can't climb that.

554
01:20:27,460 --> 01:20:28,460
I can't climb.

555
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:29,460
Why can I not climb that?

556
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:33,619
Run, run, run.

557
01:20:34,619 --> 01:20:37,710
Why is?

558
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:25,399
Oh, he baited me.

559
01:21:25,399 --> 01:21:26,399
Knock it, knock it, knock it.

560
01:21:27,399 --> 01:21:35,229
I literally can't even fucking move.

561
01:21:36,229 --> 01:21:44,489
Fucking every boss stun locks you in this game.

562
01:21:45,489 --> 01:21:57,479
Oh shit.

563
01:21:58,479 --> 01:21:59,479
Motherfucker.

564
01:22:13,199 --> 01:22:17,640
You motherfucker.

565
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:18,640
Do what I'm telling you to do.

566
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:28,300
Missed a fucking shot.

567
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:34,260
Apparently I double tapped.

568
01:22:34,260 --> 01:22:37,029
I hit it.

569
01:22:37,029 --> 01:22:44,260
Remember every make, make, make.

570
01:22:44,260 --> 01:22:45,260
I'm not even going to complain about it.

571
01:22:46,260 --> 01:22:54,609
Really?

572
01:22:54,609 --> 01:22:55,609
You mother.

573
01:22:56,609 --> 01:22:58,609
People in fucking multiplayer games don't even do what you just did.

574
01:22:59,609 --> 01:23:07,949
I'm dead.

575
01:23:30,819 --> 01:23:31,819
He jumped.

576
01:23:33,319 --> 01:23:34,319
Oh my God.

577
01:23:34,319 --> 01:23:35,319
It's so.

578
01:23:36,319 --> 01:23:42,869
Jesus Christ.

579
01:23:43,869 --> 01:23:52,220
So I need to use this on him.

580
01:23:53,220 --> 01:23:58,119
Does every boss you just kill with the blue chainsaw and just don't even play it normally.

581
01:23:59,119 --> 01:24:00,300
Thanks for the content.

582
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:05,069
Just kill every boss with a blue chainsaw and don't even deal with it.

583
01:24:05,069 --> 01:24:06,069
Okay, done.

584
01:24:06,069 --> 01:24:07,069
I'm going to go just kill him with a blue chainsaw.

585
01:24:08,630 --> 01:24:09,630
Fuck it.

586
01:24:09,630 --> 01:24:10,630
Why do anything else?

587
01:24:11,810 --> 01:24:21,750
Wait, was this before?

588
01:24:22,750 --> 01:24:24,760
I think I have to do the plaza thing again.

589
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:30,260
I think I have to do the gun shop again, don't I?

590
01:24:31,260 --> 01:24:32,260
All right, I know what to do there.

591
01:24:33,260 --> 01:24:40,329
Get a lightsaber?

592
01:24:41,329 --> 01:24:45,319
In this timeline, did I already do it?

593
01:24:46,319 --> 01:24:47,689
Just go back with the picture?

594
01:24:47,689 --> 01:24:48,689
Yeah, that's, you know, good plan.

595
01:24:49,689 --> 01:24:50,689
I like how you're thinking.

596
01:24:51,689 --> 01:24:52,689
Good plan.

597
01:24:54,760 --> 01:25:12,060
I'm going in and just blue chainsaw, just swinging him five times and win.

598
01:25:12,060 --> 01:25:13,060
I'm going to go and get him five times and win.

599
01:25:14,060 --> 01:25:17,989
Yeah, I went in the hardware store.

600
01:25:18,989 --> 01:25:19,989
I got like distracted.

601
01:25:20,989 --> 01:25:27,739
Let's just go.

602
01:25:27,739 --> 01:25:28,739
I think I should have enough to kill him with this.

603
01:25:36,250 --> 01:25:37,250
I still need to get a pair of shoes too.

604
01:25:38,250 --> 01:25:39,250
I still have shoes on.

605
01:26:01,859 --> 01:26:02,859
Spin, spin, spin, spin, spin.

606
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:09,890
Okay, let's go.

607
01:26:10,890 --> 01:26:11,890
Movie land.

608
01:26:13,770 --> 01:26:14,770
Save it.

609
01:26:15,770 --> 01:26:16,770
Over here was the bathrooms right here, right?

610
01:26:17,770 --> 01:26:21,699
Literally just walk across, save it in the bathroom.

611
01:26:22,699 --> 01:26:25,340
Wait, am I going the right way?

612
01:26:26,340 --> 01:26:30,460
Yes, get a movie land costume.

613
01:26:30,460 --> 01:26:33,460
I would enable cheats that makes it so you can't be grabbed by zombies.

614
01:26:34,460 --> 01:26:36,460
And I would not even think twice about enabling it.

615
01:26:37,460 --> 01:26:38,770
I would just turn it on.

616
01:26:41,159 --> 01:26:42,159
I just, I don't care.

617
01:26:48,329 --> 01:26:49,329
There's a drink for that?

618
01:26:50,329 --> 01:26:51,329
I think there is.

619
01:26:52,329 --> 01:26:54,590
All right, game is saved.

620
01:26:55,590 --> 01:26:56,590
Don't tell him.

621
01:27:18,949 --> 01:27:19,949
Look at that alpha nerd neck.

622
01:27:20,949 --> 01:27:28,020
Well, you made me a skexy from the crystal, whatever it is, the dead, whatever that, you know what I'm talking about.

623
01:27:29,020 --> 01:27:31,539
Okay, I am ready.

624
01:27:31,539 --> 01:27:32,539
I am ready.

625
01:27:33,539 --> 01:27:34,539
I am going to not heal yet because that takes too much.

626
01:27:35,539 --> 01:27:36,539
All right.

627
01:27:39,949 --> 01:27:43,880
Now I have to heal.

628
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:52,140
Oh, it hurts every time.

629
01:27:53,140 --> 01:27:59,180
Did you seriously just body block me from walking?

630
01:28:00,180 --> 01:28:01,180
Get the fuck out of here.

631
01:28:02,180 --> 01:28:03,180
That's what you deserve.

632
01:28:10,180 --> 01:28:11,180
All right, I don't need the shop.

633
01:28:12,180 --> 01:28:17,510
Okay, go to movie land and get a costume.

634
01:28:18,510 --> 01:28:20,710
I'm not going to use, why I use the card?

635
01:28:21,710 --> 01:28:27,560
Use the double lariat skill.

636
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:29,560
Okay, this powerful skill calls upon the art judo.

637
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:32,560
When grabbed by a zombie, push left stick downward repeatedly to toss the attacker.

638
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:33,560
Okay, so I've done that.

639
01:28:36,850 --> 01:28:37,850
I know that.

640
01:28:38,850 --> 01:28:40,600
So I get to do a zangief?

641
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:42,600
Press and hold left stick and then press X.

642
01:28:51,899 --> 01:28:52,899
Did I just lose the shotgun?

643
01:29:03,100 --> 01:29:11,140
I didn't know I was going to fucking throw the thing.

644
01:29:12,140 --> 01:29:13,829
Okay.

645
01:29:14,829 --> 01:29:16,260
Is it going to be there if I go back?

646
01:29:17,260 --> 01:29:18,260
No, because there's a cut scene in between.

647
01:29:20,020 --> 01:29:21,020
I can't even walk up this ramp.

648
01:29:22,020 --> 01:29:27,289
It doesn't exist.

649
01:29:33,260 --> 01:29:34,260
Okay, I'm going to get some refreshments.

650
01:29:35,260 --> 01:29:36,260
I have plenty of time.

651
01:29:37,819 --> 01:29:38,819
I know what's over there.

652
01:29:40,260 --> 01:29:41,689
Touchable.

653
01:29:42,689 --> 01:29:43,689
At least true power within.

654
01:29:44,689 --> 01:29:47,340
No one can touch you.

655
01:29:48,340 --> 01:29:49,510
So that was a bag, a snack.

656
01:29:50,510 --> 01:29:51,510
What's this one?

657
01:29:52,510 --> 01:29:53,510
Quick step.

658
01:29:55,779 --> 01:30:04,119
All right, we're going to make like a Cheetos smoothie.

659
01:30:05,119 --> 01:30:07,770
Spitfire.

660
01:30:08,770 --> 01:30:09,770
What does spitfire do?

661
01:30:10,770 --> 01:30:11,770
I think I've even used it.

662
01:30:12,770 --> 01:30:13,770
Okay, wait, wait, hold on.

663
01:30:15,260 --> 01:30:16,260
I got to break some stuff.

664
01:30:17,439 --> 01:30:19,829
There might be food in here.

665
01:30:21,329 --> 01:30:22,329
There is.

666
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:27,960
Okay, there's lettuce and there's another one.

667
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:32,380
Is there food?

668
01:30:33,380 --> 01:30:37,369
I don't have any other food.

669
01:30:38,369 --> 01:30:39,369
No can of drinks, I can't.

670
01:30:40,369 --> 01:30:42,310
Damn it.

671
01:30:43,310 --> 01:30:44,310
Well, I'm just going to eat the lettuce.

672
01:30:45,310 --> 01:30:46,310
The wine.

673
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:50,600
Oh, that's right.

674
01:30:59,390 --> 01:31:00,390
So I do lettuce and wine.

675
01:31:01,390 --> 01:31:02,390
I'm going to do lettuce and wine.

676
01:31:04,079 --> 01:31:05,079
And that is quick step.

677
01:31:09,779 --> 01:31:10,779
That's a good one.

678
01:31:15,279 --> 01:31:21,060
Okay, then I'm going to do.

679
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:23,060
Can I put the queen in there?

680
01:31:24,060 --> 01:31:25,060
Jeff, five community subs.

681
01:31:26,060 --> 01:31:30,890
Thank you, Jeff.

682
01:31:31,890 --> 01:31:37,100
Still got plenty of time.

683
01:31:40,510 --> 01:31:41,510
The stick sucks?

684
01:31:46,399 --> 01:31:47,399
It's okay.

685
01:31:48,399 --> 01:31:49,399
I'm assuming the costume is here.

686
01:31:51,149 --> 01:31:52,149
Can I get shoes on in this place?

687
01:31:59,149 --> 01:32:00,149
Oh, that's an awesome superhero.

688
01:32:01,149 --> 01:32:11,029
I might dress up as Mega Man.

689
01:32:12,029 --> 01:32:13,029
Is that what you want me to do?

690
01:32:23,810 --> 01:32:25,750
It's a Nerf gun.

691
01:32:30,579 --> 01:32:31,579
That's so cool.

692
01:32:32,579 --> 01:32:33,579
What was that?

693
01:32:34,579 --> 01:32:35,579
I don't know what the fuck that was.

694
01:32:36,579 --> 01:32:37,579
All right, I don't want this thing.

695
01:32:38,579 --> 01:32:39,579
This thing just shoots Nerf balls.

696
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:44,500
Give me my rat stick back.

697
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:57,819
Oh, I have to bake it through.

698
01:32:58,819 --> 01:33:01,819
And I'm going to go like this.

699
01:33:02,819 --> 01:33:03,819
And let's go.

700
01:33:04,819 --> 01:33:05,819
Do the lariat.

701
01:33:06,819 --> 01:33:07,819
Do the lariat.

702
01:33:08,819 --> 01:33:33,159
Hold, left stick, lariat.

703
01:33:34,159 --> 01:33:36,159
They were nice enough to leave the Mega Man helmet on.

704
01:33:50,329 --> 01:33:51,329
They have to be standing still for that to work.

705
01:34:04,729 --> 01:34:05,729
They're surprisingly calm.

706
01:34:08,630 --> 01:34:11,630
Now I wish I had the shopping cart.

707
01:34:12,630 --> 01:34:13,630
Because that's going to be paying the ass.

708
01:34:24,409 --> 01:34:25,409
I know, I know.

709
01:34:25,409 --> 01:34:26,409
I know.

710
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:30,760
Get the rat suit.

711
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:35,300
There is no rat suit.

712
01:34:36,300 --> 01:34:37,300
I don't want to use this.

713
01:34:38,300 --> 01:34:40,380
I'm going to try to use the stick.

714
01:34:41,939 --> 01:34:43,750
I'm just going to try to jump through.

715
01:34:44,750 --> 01:34:45,750
Holy shit, this thing sucks.

716
01:34:46,750 --> 01:34:47,750
They did it again.

717
01:34:48,750 --> 01:34:49,750
They got me again with the fucking spray.

718
01:34:50,750 --> 01:34:51,750
They just spray.

719
01:34:53,569 --> 01:34:54,569
Did I get the question wrong?

720
01:34:55,569 --> 01:34:59,239
Sorry.

721
01:35:00,239 --> 01:35:01,539
You didn't do it right.

722
01:35:02,539 --> 01:35:03,539
That's your guy's button.

723
01:35:04,539 --> 01:35:11,930
He didn't do that right.

724
01:35:12,930 --> 01:35:26,649
Curious George.

725
01:35:27,649 --> 01:35:29,210
Man in the yellow red hat.

726
01:35:30,210 --> 01:35:31,210
Whatever the fucking thing is.

727
01:35:32,210 --> 01:35:41,829
Yellow red McDonald's.

728
01:35:42,829 --> 01:35:43,829
Maybe I'm hungry.

729
01:35:44,829 --> 01:35:46,329
Maybe I should get some McDonald's.

730
01:35:47,329 --> 01:35:48,329
Alright, I'm going to get the cart.

731
01:35:49,329 --> 01:35:50,329
I'm going to run through.

732
01:35:51,329 --> 01:35:52,329
And then I'm going to kill the guy with the sword.

733
01:35:53,329 --> 01:35:54,329
Sounds like a plan, Jeremy.

734
01:36:01,579 --> 01:36:02,579
I think you should do it.

735
01:36:03,579 --> 01:36:04,579
That sounds like something you should do.

736
01:36:05,579 --> 01:36:06,579
Do a McDonald's review stream, part two.

737
01:36:07,579 --> 01:36:08,579
It's not very good.

738
01:36:15,260 --> 01:36:16,260
But I still eat it.

739
01:36:17,260 --> 01:36:18,260
It's awful.

740
01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:25,750
Alright, go.

741
01:36:26,930 --> 01:36:29,319
What did I do wrong?

742
01:36:30,319 --> 01:36:31,319
What did I do wrong?

743
01:36:32,319 --> 01:36:33,880
I did that right.

744
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:40,859
How was that incorrect?

745
01:36:41,859 --> 01:36:42,859
What theater is it?

746
01:36:47,100 --> 01:36:48,100
What theater is it?

747
01:36:49,100 --> 01:36:51,180
Which theater is it?

748
01:36:54,140 --> 01:37:17,779
Let's go.

749
01:37:18,779 --> 01:37:19,779
Don't get cocky.

750
01:37:20,779 --> 01:37:21,779
It's just like fucking that game that I reference every other.

751
01:37:42,609 --> 01:37:43,609
I thought that was a person.

752
01:37:45,420 --> 01:37:56,430
Should have secured that with a few sandbags.

753
01:37:57,430 --> 01:38:08,250
You obtained the movie leeeeeeee...

754
01:38:15,199 --> 01:38:16,199
Wait a minute.

755
01:38:17,199 --> 01:38:18,569
They have guns?

756
01:38:19,569 --> 01:38:20,569
No, no, no, no, don't let them spread out.

757
01:38:27,569 --> 01:38:30,920
Don't spread out.

758
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:32,920
Do I get any grenades?

759
01:38:37,420 --> 01:38:38,420
I'm going to save the people but this is bad.

760
01:38:46,130 --> 01:38:50,500
He's going to explode.

761
01:38:51,500 --> 01:38:53,130
He's going to explode.

762
01:38:54,130 --> 01:38:56,329
Don't get sprayed.

763
01:38:57,329 --> 01:38:58,329
Okay, we're good.

764
01:38:59,329 --> 01:39:00,329

01:56:40,430 --> 01:56:51,420
actually is pretty good so I got a lot of time to do that let's do the

845
01:56:51,420 --> 01:56:55,819
photographer's pride first and then I have to make sure I'm back for the I

846

this as long as I can I wish I could can I make my inventory less cluttered

856
01:58:50,470 --> 01:58:56,520
what's my favorite banana cream pie is the best pie without a doubt it's

857
01:58:56,520 --> 01:59:00,539
actually the only pie I think I don't like after pie I don't like blueberry pie

858
01:59:00,539 --> 01:59:04,680
any fruit based pies that's not a banana I don't find appetizing at all

859
01:59:04,680 --> 01:59:11,239
banana cream pie is all right but I mean that's what I just said chocolate

860
01:59:11,239 --> 01:59:15,840
cream pie is pretty good but if it's not banana cream pie I don't want to eat it

861
01:59:15,840 --> 01:59:22,300
I don't want it um do I have enough time to do any of these other things I don't

862
01:59:22,340 --> 01:59:35,939
think so I'm gonna miss this shit where was a sick man I have the vent picture

in the north area. Canned food. You guys are the worst. Really? Un-b-lievable. You

1250
03:26:24,549 --> 03:26:29,190
made me go back and pick up the canned food and I can't even eat it? Oh, you guys

1251
03:26:29,190 --> 03:26:58,719

1252
03:26:58,719 --> 03:27:28,479
Pick up the canned food, dumbass. Dog laugh? You mean the dog? Oh, was that what you

1253
03:27:28,479 --> 03:27:47,559
wanted to get? You too? Oh, sure, thank god. That's my way. Jump! I'm trying to jump on his

1254
03:27:47,559 --> 03:28:06,739
head. Oh my god. I'm trying to jump on his head. Oh, I can go up to the cafe. He's going full

1255
03:28:06,739 --> 03:28:25,819
tuber at this point. Not quite. Hit the bell. Did I still even have the bell on YouTube? Why

1256
03:28:25,819 --> 03:28:31,319
did I not jump on his head? Explain it. I want a full, I want a paragraph from

1257
03:28:31,319 --> 03:28:35,680
everyone, everybody here. There's a why that didn't jump on his head. A full

1258
03:28:35,680 --> 03:29:00,510
paragraph. I'm not seeing very many paragraphs. This is going to be bad. Here comes a

1259
03:29:00,510 --> 03:29:13,559
terrible scenario. Terrible scenario. Terrible scenario. Terrible scenario. Here

1260
03:29:13,559 --> 03:29:45,229
it comes. Fuck. We're good. Who is that?

1261
03:29:45,229 --> 03:30:05,250
I have to go all the way back there. Forward, back, forth, back, forth. You couldn't have put these

1262
03:30:05,250 --> 03:30:26,790
next to each other. Oh my fucking god. I gotta save the damn game too. What the fuck? I'm not

1263
03:30:26,790 --> 03:30:42,079
gonna make it down there in time. I don't even know which one of these is good. Is it in the middle? I

1264
03:30:42,680 --> 03:30:53,549
have so many different timelines. Okay. What's the fastest way to get there? Butcher. Am I gonna be

1265
03:30:53,549 --> 03:31:16,940
able to do this? I just came from there. I have to just run through the park. Run to the parking

1266
03:31:16,940 --> 03:31:33,760
lot and then drive. I don't have the key to open the doors. Go through the tunnel. Go through

1267
03:31:33,760 --> 03:31:42,360
park with bike. But where's the, there's no bike. The maintenance, I don't have the maintenance

1268
03:31:42,360 --> 03:31:50,520
key. Remember I tried to go up from the tunnel and I didn't have the maintenance key to leave?

1269
03:31:50,520 --> 03:32:01,680
Well, let's see if I can get, I don't even, I need health too. This is kind of a disaster.

1270
03:32:01,680 --> 03:32:22,079
He's entrapping us. Well, let me see what happens when I need to get food through the tunnels. But

1271
03:32:22,079 --> 03:32:35,819
where's the key? I don't have enough time to do this. I think it's over. Make a quick step? Yeah,

1272
03:32:35,819 --> 03:32:51,329
but by the time I make like two or three quick steps it's over. I definitely have time. Do I though?

1273
03:32:51,489 --> 03:33:07,250
Oh, how is that even possible to miss? Why would you shoot up and to the right?

1274
03:33:08,530 --> 03:33:12,209
I might, this might be the beginning of the end here. I might be soft-locked.

1275
03:33:16,069 --> 03:33:22,840
It's very possible because I got to get up there and I probably have to kill the boss in this

1276
03:33:22,840 --> 03:33:58,799
timeline. Food in the box near the elevator. I have plenty of weapons. Is this not on my list

1277
03:33:58,799 --> 03:34:28,840
of things to do? Get it on! Tons of time. I got to get up to the cafe. What the fuck? What the fuck?

1278
03:35:03,559 --> 03:35:09,079
Oh my god, there's a fucking million of them. There's a million of them. There's a million of

1279
03:35:09,079 --> 03:35:19,319
them. Ah, what do I get rid of? A handgun. Oh shit, okay. Wait, wait, wait, two orange juices.

1280
03:35:19,319 --> 03:35:30,180
What does that do? I don't have time to figure this out. What is, I don't even know what this is.

1281
03:35:30,180 --> 03:35:44,079
Nectar? Okay, drop the sniper rifles for the orange juice. Okay, that's good, right? I have to leave.

1282
03:35:45,600 --> 03:36:08,520
Okay, I have to, I have to, I have to leave right now. Bye. Out of time. Drink one. Fuck. Go. Should

1283
03:36:08,520 --> 03:36:31,590
I save it? No, it could be a disaster if I save. Oh, I have so many shotgun bullets. There's too

1284
03:36:31,590 --> 03:36:53,110
many. I just got to get there and get a shopping cart and run. There's a motorcycle. Does anybody

1285
03:36:53,110 --> 03:36:59,159
know what the actual time is that I need to beat this by? Why is it telling me to go this way?

1286
03:36:59,719 --> 03:37:16,149
Wait, why is it doing, why am I going this way? You have to take the tunnel so I get the car.

1287
03:37:16,149 --> 03:37:37,540
I get the motorcycle. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Okay, motorcycle. Do I have time?

1288
03:37:38,180 --> 03:37:47,270
I have to go, but I don't, I just, the save point is so far behind us.

1289
03:37:48,069 --> 03:38:02,760
Okay, now go which way? Which way, which way, which way? Get off my screen. Straight and then left.

1290
03:38:18,610 --> 03:38:54,680
What's this GPS bullshit? I did it. I have to kill him in like 30 seconds. I have like three

1291
03:38:54,680 --> 03:39:08,229
shotguns. Is it enough? That guy, I mean that meat. This is good meat, huh? We just got it in here.

1292
03:39:08,229 --> 03:39:18,069
It's fresh. You just wait right there, sir. In a moment, you can try the best ground meat you've ever

1293
03:39:18,069 --> 03:39:28,520
tasted. Whoa, ground? Wait a minute, listen. I had something else in mind. Zombies! I can't

1294
03:39:29,000 --> 03:39:38,639
my customers spoiled meat like that. Keep this guy alive. Have a reputation to uphold.

1295
03:39:38,639 --> 03:39:54,840
I mean, he'd be a pretty good companion. Huge meat flavor. He's turning on this machine, which,

1296
03:39:55,959 --> 03:40:09,520
can I push him in? Or do I just have to kill him? Shotgun, shotgun head, shotgun head,

1297
03:40:09,520 --> 03:40:46,709
head shotgun. Okay, you got it. He's got throwing knives. Wow! Ow, that hurt. Am I shooting car,

1298
03:40:46,709 --> 03:41:30,239
Carlito in the head? I tried to dodge it. Oh, please! Oh, sorry. No invisibility frames.

1299
03:41:30,799 --> 03:42:40,340
Was it enough? He's crying, you frick. What are you guys talking about?

1300
03:42:51,510 --> 03:43:09,559
I know it's the end of the movie, but why would I ask that at the end of the movie?

1301
03:43:32,959 --> 03:43:38,079
Hey, that's the password. That was an easy password.

1302
03:44:14,340 --> 03:44:30,899
This was just chapter one. You've got three more chapters after this one. If you thought the butcher

1303
03:44:30,899 --> 03:44:40,719
was annoying. Wait till you get to the... I'm trying to name something that wasn't in this game,

1304
03:44:40,719 --> 03:44:47,600
but I can't think of anything that wasn't in the game. Like police officer. Clown, you know,

1305
03:44:47,600 --> 03:45:03,889
both in it. Like psycho guy with mask on it. Demon, probably. Pants, yeah. Astronaut. This is

1306
03:45:03,889 --> 03:45:25,399
probably an astronaut in the game. It's probably one of the psychos. Done. The facts. Case 8.4 done

1307
03:45:25,399 --> 03:45:36,659
from 10 p.m. The next case will occur at 10 p.m. Uh-oh. Where's that one? Where's that one? Where's

1308
03:45:36,659 --> 03:45:45,520
that one? Um, I have a meat cleaver. I gotta go. There's probably something cool in here,

1309
03:45:45,520 --> 03:45:58,389
but I don't have time. Save the game? Where? Where's my car? No, there is a car.

1310
03:46:01,909 --> 03:46:23,959
Oh god. Why? I have no time. Where do I go? The hideout. Oh shit. Um, okay, so can I get... I can't

1311
03:46:23,959 --> 03:46:30,920
get up this way. I have to go out and to the park again. I have to go right, right, and then I have

1312
03:46:30,920 --> 03:46:43,809
to take the car and then out to the park into North Plaza. Right, left, left. You can get the key in

1313
03:46:43,809 --> 03:46:55,319
the tunnel here. In here? I don't have... Guys, there's no save point. I think I have to go with

1314
03:46:55,319 --> 03:47:05,590
what I know. I'm gonna go right. I'm gonna go right. That's all I'm doing. That's what I'm doing.

1315
03:47:06,790 --> 03:47:22,680
I gotta go with what I know. And that's all I know. Do I even need to get out of the car?

1316
03:47:23,399 --> 03:47:34,290
Stay in this one. Good. No travel time. Good. Frank, this Cheryl girl, she just wants to talk

1317
03:47:34,290 --> 03:47:42,120
to you about something. She's kind of cute if I were you. Otis, look at the clock. No, no, no,

1318
03:47:42,120 --> 03:47:54,680
no, no, no. Don't drive. It's this way. It's right here. Get out of the car. Get out of the car. Out.

1319
03:47:55,649 --> 03:48:12,500
Out of the car. Please stop the car. Stop the car. Cart? Chopping cart? No, fuck the snacks.

1320
03:48:13,700 --> 03:48:26,309
This... No, chopping carts are a good spot. You fuckers. Do I have a nest? I have a bee's nest.

1321
03:48:27,270 --> 03:48:41,270
Where's the cleaver? Go. Go hurry. What the fuck are you talking about?

1322
03:48:43,299 --> 03:48:55,969
Leave me alone. Turn. This thing's got some dog shit turning. Where is it? Get away from my penis.

1323
03:48:56,930 --> 03:49:11,569
Where is it? Where is it? It's left? It's in the gun shop? Get this thing out of here.

1324
03:49:15,440 --> 03:49:20,319
No, I need that. Where is it? Help me. I'm fucking panicking. Is it the gun store?

1325
03:49:21,200 --> 03:49:30,629
This person has mowed a fake lawn. Oh, son of a bitch.

1326
03:49:35,540 --> 03:49:42,799
Get away from me. Give me the nest. Give me the bee's nest. No, fuck. I didn't want to do that.

1327
03:49:43,600 --> 03:50:01,719
Right here. Go, go, go, go, go. Up, up, up, up, up. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Why am I panicking?

1328
03:50:01,719 --> 03:50:18,500
Because I have like three in-game actual minutes to get there. She's high as fuck.

1329
03:50:28,360 --> 03:50:40,450
She's been up here just doing drugs the whole time. Ah, damn it. Can you just hold my hand?

1330
03:50:42,690 --> 03:50:46,290
Now she's going to pick up. I'm going to give her like an axe and she's going to swing it twice.

1331
03:50:46,290 --> 03:50:53,350
Her eye pupils are going to be like the size of fucking footballs. She's going to bump into

1332
03:50:53,350 --> 03:51:30,559
walls and shit. That'd be the game. Is this the end? He said there's something inside that you

1333
03:51:30,559 --> 03:51:43,059
really would like. She opens it. It's like fucking like drug dust. There it is. Drug? I

1334
03:51:43,059 --> 03:51:47,780
would say cocaine. Am I going to not? I can't say cocaine? Is that against the law me saying the

1335
03:51:47,780 --> 03:51:59,510
word cocaine? Why do I feel like I was going to get in trouble for saying cocaine? Is my mother

1336
03:51:59,510 --> 03:52:26,530
watching? She might be. Yeah, it's my mother's own personal terms of service. Don't talk about

1337
03:52:26,530 --> 03:52:32,930
drugs. Don't talk about anything like sexual, Jeremy. You're better than that. I got a personal

1338
03:52:32,930 --> 03:52:54,709
mom T.O.S. That's right. You're right. That's right. She just snorted it.

1339
03:52:57,430 --> 03:53:31,540
I was actually right. That's pretty good. It's like latte art for cocaine and shit. Nice.

1340
03:53:31,540 --> 03:54:02,309
All cases closed, but. But what? What does that mean? Saved. Cheryl's request. I know I was wrong.

1341
03:54:02,309 --> 03:54:07,270
He harmed too many innocents and thought only of himself. Even so, I got a long time to do this.

1342
03:54:07,989 --> 03:54:28,239
It actually is chapter two. All right, let's go. I have to be on the roof at the right time?

1343
03:54:28,239 --> 03:54:39,639
Well, what time is it right now? It's 10 20 on the 21st. What time do I have to get on the roof?

1344
03:54:40,200 --> 03:54:59,170
Frank, the emergency line's been freed up. I'll give headquarters a call. Hang on. Roof now.

1345
03:55:01,879 --> 03:55:05,559
This is agent Jessica McCarney. We have an emergency situation.

1346
03:55:07,569 --> 03:55:34,709
Huh? All right. What? Why did you put me on hold? Do a suplex. Hold on. Skills.

1347
03:55:35,350 --> 03:55:39,510
Roundhouse kick. Okay. Lift up. Lift a zombie and give them a toss with this skill.

1348
03:55:40,229 --> 03:55:45,780
Press X and A without pushing anything and then press X again to throw. All right. Knee drop.

1349
03:55:46,500 --> 03:55:51,600
During a jump, press X while pushing down. Grab your opponent and send them flying,

1350
03:55:51,600 --> 03:55:55,600
facing a standing enemy's back. Press X and A without pushing anything.

1351
03:55:56,319 --> 03:56:05,879
Well, that's awesome. All right, let's go. I need a shopping cart.

1352
03:56:19,239 --> 03:56:29,729
Get more guns. Is that necessary? Well, I wish I had this before. What's going on?

1353
03:56:43,200 --> 03:56:43,600
It's over.

1354
03:56:44,239 --> 03:56:51,280
Contacted headquarters. The government has decided to deny all knowledge of what happened here.

1355
03:56:53,670 --> 03:56:59,590
Special forces will arrive for cleanup at midnight. Midnight. They'll take everyone out.

1356
03:57:00,629 --> 03:57:12,020
So I steal the helicopter that they landed. People. Everyone. That's easy. Oh, fuck. What's

1357
03:57:12,020 --> 03:57:21,409
wrong with me lately? I can't even mute. It's just power that comes out of me. I can't even

1358
03:57:21,409 --> 03:57:31,459
stop it. I can't even press mute in time. Go to the roof right now. I'm not going to make it.

1359
03:57:32,020 --> 03:57:56,450
Just leave the mall laughing my ass off. Well, I don't have enough time to do this.

1360
03:57:57,090 --> 03:58:05,319
What time is it? I got like an hour. It's turned around here. All right. Everyone,

1361
03:58:05,319 --> 03:58:19,760
just leave me the fuck alone. I need to go this way. I'm going to get a gun. All right.

1362
03:58:19,760 --> 03:58:28,879
The Yoshi stomp is seriously so good. It was in the middle over in the door, you fucker.

1363
03:58:32,639 --> 03:58:41,860
Okay. Guns. Here we go. Shotgun. Sniper rifle. As many shotguns as I can grab. That's not a gun.

1364
03:58:42,739 --> 03:58:51,719
Any more shotguns? Isn't there one leaning over here? Just take the other sniper rifle.

1365
03:58:51,719 --> 03:59:06,440
Fuck it. All right. Let's go. How did they all get in here? Did you seriously? Did I just get

1366
03:59:06,440 --> 03:59:16,360
stopped? That takes priority? This is a fighting game? All right. I got some guns. Still have

1367
03:59:16,360 --> 03:59:59,090
orange juice. Unbelievable. All right. Out. Back to the helipad. Give me a cart. Face cam for the

1368
03:59:59,090 --> 04:00:20,680
ending. All right. Fine. Not yet, though. I do want a cart. Let's go. By midnight, right? I got time.

1369
04:00:20,680 --> 04:00:39,620
I didn't know what just happened, but I'm okay. I never did took care of these guys, did I?

1370
04:00:40,579 --> 04:00:49,799
Did it seriously just stop? It's broken already. I was going to say, give me a break. What's wrong

1371
04:00:49,799 --> 04:01:20,399
with this thing? I can't use it outside. I got, I have time. I'm okay. I got ammo. I got decent

1372
04:01:20,399 --> 04:01:31,680
healing. By decent healing, I mean none, but I'm going to go in here and I'm going to go up and

1373
04:01:31,680 --> 04:01:47,250
I'm going to make another smoothie. Smoothie. Smoothies with orange juice. And then I'm going

1374
04:01:47,250 --> 04:01:52,389
to try to get the blue chainsaw. You feeling me here? You understand what I'm saying, right?

1375
04:01:52,950 --> 04:02:07,750
Okay. I got to go up every time. Leave me alone. You guys are just fucking aggravating me. Just

1376
04:02:07,750 --> 04:02:36,870
aggravating. Time check. Close. Let's go. It's a lot of fucking time. I don't have time to get the

1377
04:02:36,870 --> 04:03:06,180
chainsaw. What are you doing? I need a sword, weapon, something, a weapon of some kind.

1378
04:03:06,180 --> 04:03:15,030
Fuse the smoothies together. No, I need a weapon of some kind. A katana. Where's a katana? The

1379
04:03:15,030 --> 04:03:21,920
sword is next to you. It's right next to me. It's over the ledge. You kidding me? Like over here?

1380
04:03:21,920 --> 04:03:34,770
Where? Holy shit. What is this? A katana. Which thing sucks? Okay. Let's go. All right. Now,

1381
04:03:38,500 --> 04:03:41,860
what time is it? Where do I go? Just back to the maintenance room? What's over here?

1382
04:03:44,950 --> 04:03:55,399
I have to go to the helipad. So just to go back. Okay. I'm going to slow down. I just have to go

1383
04:03:57,030 --> 04:04:03,600
to where... leave the game and just go upstairs, right? Like go back to the security room and go

1384
04:04:03,600 --> 04:04:39,270
upstairs. Okay. I want to make sure I get this right. That's correct. Okay. I'm okay. Don't

1385
04:04:39,270 --> 04:04:51,940
break on me now. I have to save the damn game. Okay. I'll do one swing. What's going on?

1386
04:04:53,909 --> 04:05:06,209
Jessica McCarney, talk about your close calls. You contacted us just in time. Your boss thought

1387
04:05:06,209 --> 04:05:11,889
we should have a talk with you before the operation begins. We'll be taking you into custody.

1388
04:05:12,530 --> 04:05:24,049
If you sign an agreement to keep your mouth shut about all this, you'll be free to go. I don't know

1389
04:05:24,049 --> 04:05:28,639
why I thought that was me. I was like, is this like a cut scene where I got dressed and got a gun

1390
04:05:28,639 --> 04:06:19,909
and everything? Uh-oh. Well, that's not good. Pretty good observation. Yeah. That was not good.

1391
04:06:20,469 --> 04:06:39,399
I got 15 minutes. Jesse, you all right in there? Are you just taking out some anger

1392
04:06:39,399 --> 04:06:42,680
against like a punching bag or the wall? Are you just unloading a clip into something?

1393
04:06:43,399 --> 04:07:09,680
If only Brad was alive. Time until hello. Oh, I have 12 hours and 13 minutes. Well, I'm here.

1394
04:07:09,680 --> 04:07:17,409
Wait, is everybody turned? Is everybody a zombie now? That's not good. Is it the thing I said

1395
04:07:17,409 --> 04:07:32,370
before but not the thing I said? Just like the reverse what I just said? Everybody's a zombie.

1396
04:07:43,540 --> 04:08:22,370
Guys, that's not a bad photo. I got our head upside down. All right. Let's get out. I got to

1397
04:08:22,370 --> 04:08:30,930
do this right. That's okay. That's I'm trying to zoom. How do I zoom in with sniper rifle?

1398
04:08:30,930 --> 04:08:54,399
To hold the button down? How do I shoot it? Oh, okay. That's how. Okay. What? What happened?

1399
04:08:54,399 --> 04:09:48,309
What happened at 12 hours? They're clearing this out. This is fine. Uh, anybody left in here? I got

1400
04:09:48,309 --> 04:10:17,190
some bad news guys. There's nobody here. Um, okay. I'm gonna change this slot to right in the middle.

1401
04:10:17,190 --> 04:10:37,159
There's a note on the table. Frank while you're out some crazy people snuck in from the rooftop

1402
04:10:37,159 --> 04:10:42,549
and started snatching people. I heard a hell of a racket coming from the monitors where the

1403
04:10:42,549 --> 04:10:47,270
monitors are. So I'm taking a talk taking advantage. I might not look the type but I've got a small

1404
04:10:47,270 --> 04:10:51,989
aircraft pilot's license. I haven't seen Jessie. There's no time to look for her now. I've got to

1405
04:10:51,989 --> 04:10:56,920
get out while I'm getting good. I hope you don't think I'm a coward. If we meet on the other side,

1406
04:10:56,920 --> 04:11:12,520
I definitely owe you a drink. Good luck Frank. Otis Washington. Really? Helipad? Is it me and

1407
04:11:12,520 --> 04:11:47,860
Otis gonna just take off? I'm out of here. Let's go. Wait, he ditched me. He left? What time is it?

1408
04:11:47,860 --> 04:12:03,760
Well, what the hell am I supposed to do now? Just, can I just stay in there for 12 hours?

1409
04:12:03,760 --> 04:12:17,079
Yeah, I have until noon. Okay. So I guess I'm just gonna go out here and see what's going on.

1410
04:12:25,459 --> 04:12:42,870
The mall is now my oyster. Yes. Yes. I feel so good. Wait, there's people in here now.

1411
04:12:42,870 --> 04:12:46,639
The random dickhead with the katana is not going to stand a chance right here.

1412
04:12:47,360 --> 04:13:39,239
Crazy guy with a katana. Oh, fuck. What is happening? Okay. I'll take one of these. I'll take

1413
04:13:39,239 --> 04:13:45,940
two of these. I'll take three of these. You know what? I'll take four of these. Sounds good to me.

1414
04:13:46,659 --> 04:14:18,420
How cool is this to use? Pretty cool. All right, I got 11 hours. Let's just have, let's play. Oops.

1415
04:14:18,420 --> 04:14:34,069
All right, I'm gonna go get the chainsaw. Nectar. Still haven't figured out what this does.

1416
04:14:34,629 --> 04:14:51,540
Does it spawn a queen or something? All right, I'm gonna save it. Put your cam on. I will when

1417
04:14:51,540 --> 04:15:02,819
there's one hour remaining. Wait, Isabelle is still up in like the room, isn't she? All right,

1418
04:15:02,819 --> 04:15:09,000
I'm gonna go get the chainsaw and I'm going up and I'm gonna go talk to Isabelle. Oh shit,

1419
04:15:09,000 --> 04:15:37,270
they're right here. That's kind of awful. I mean, like these guys are awful. There's

1420
04:15:37,270 --> 04:15:42,559
iframes on that so I can only shoot them like once. What was the, I just got achievement. What

1421
04:15:42,559 --> 04:15:47,360
was the achievement? Was there somebody in like a flannel shirt? Anybody know what that was? I

1422
04:15:47,360 --> 04:16:13,760
didn't see it. I just saw it pop up for a quarter of a second. All right, I'm good. Now we're going

1423
04:16:13,760 --> 04:16:30,280
to go up to Isabelle and see what the hell she has to say. Going the right way, right? No, absolutely

1424
04:16:30,280 --> 04:16:44,290
I'm not going the right way. Go get the book. Shoes? I can't take any shoes. This is the one

1425
04:16:44,290 --> 04:17:14,340
opportunity I have. They don't sell shoes here. Give me that gun. I hate this fucking streamer.

1426
04:17:18,180 --> 04:17:34,549
Bug? Not even worth it. Oh fuck, there's somebody behind me. Where did you guys come from? Thanks

1427
04:17:34,549 --> 04:17:53,350
for letting me drink the whole thing, dumbass. Okay, so I'm gonna go up. We're gonna save here

1428
04:17:53,350 --> 04:18:10,440
and I'm gonna go to the hideout. All right, they're dropping in from there. It's kind of

1429
04:18:10,440 --> 04:18:25,219
hard to see. I've got an itchy fucking whole face. My entire face is itchy. Where's the other guy?

1430
04:18:25,219 --> 04:18:36,790
There's another guy shooting. From where though? I can't see him. I hear it. Where is he? Where is

1431
04:18:36,790 --> 04:19:39,299
he? There he is. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Yeah! Bullet point achievement unlocked. Straight ahead.

1432
04:19:39,299 --> 04:20:03,409
Left. Bullet point. What's that mean? Isabelle at 10 p.m. What is that? What are you talking about?

1433
04:20:03,969 --> 04:20:14,440
Okay, so I got... Oh shit. Okay, so I have... Isabella is down... straight down here, right?

1434
04:20:14,440 --> 04:20:34,760
Like right here? It's right here, isn't it? Correctly. What am I catching your breath?

1435
04:20:34,760 --> 04:20:41,200
What are you taking a breather, Frank? Oh for the love of god, why do you have to fall on the ground?

1436
04:20:41,200 --> 04:21:06,600
Is this the one over here, right? Oh fuck. Oh fuck, I didn't know they were gonna be here.

1437
04:21:06,600 --> 04:21:39,760
Get up! Get up! Did I make it in time? 10 a.m.?

1438
04:21:52,579 --> 04:22:01,649
Sexy and incoming Jerma, seriously? That's one of the most absurd things I've ever heard.

1439
04:22:01,649 --> 04:22:24,309
I've lost all track of where these save points are at this point. I have to be back here at 10 a.m.

1440
04:22:27,569 --> 04:22:30,850
Nothing's changed at all. They never admit when they're at fault. They didn't at Seneca Bay

1441
04:22:30,850 --> 04:22:36,129
say they won't know. She's right. If we die here, the evidence will be covered up and the truth will

1442
04:22:36,129 --> 04:22:41,639
stay in the shadows forever and nothing will change. That's why we got to survive. We'll let the

1443
04:22:41,639 --> 04:22:54,149
military to their work, then make our move. All right, what time is it right now? It is 2 15 a.m.

1444
04:22:54,149 --> 04:23:14,760
p.m.? 2 15 p.m.? So I have to be back here at by 10 a.m. So then just live, just hang out,

1445
04:23:14,760 --> 04:23:30,100
just survive until 10 a.m. Talk to her and then by 12 be back on the helipad. Got it. So in the

1446
04:23:30,100 --> 04:23:38,549
meantime, I have time to... I don't even know what the hell I want to do. Go to the grocery store?

1447
04:23:38,549 --> 04:23:54,850
Make some smoothies? Save Brad. Find shoes. Save Brad. Is that even possible at this point?

1448
04:23:55,569 --> 04:24:17,860
Where's Brad? Okay, so I'm going to go to the grocery store. Where's that grocery store? It's

1449
04:24:17,860 --> 04:24:30,120
a huge grocery store, is it? It's back here. Should I even... 11 a.m. not 12 a.m., please.

1450
04:24:30,920 --> 04:24:43,940
Wait a minute, what do you mean 11 a.m.? I fucking hate these stupid zombies. I have to go back this

1451
04:24:43,940 --> 04:25:08,209
way. That lady just fucking blocking me. Honest to God, why don't I just like stand in that room for

1452
04:25:08,209 --> 04:25:35,489
four hours? Where's the other one? The one dead? Oh my God. Where's the other one? With... Excuse me?

1453
04:25:35,489 --> 04:26:11,989
Excuse me? Really? Oh yeah, yi. Okay, left. I was distracted. That's fine. Okay, level up apparently.

1454
04:26:13,219 --> 04:26:20,549
New skill mastered. You mastered the hammer throw skill. There's a bike here.

1455
04:26:33,729 --> 04:26:37,750
All right, I'm gonna just hang out in the grocery store. Is there a blender in the grocery store?

1456
04:26:38,309 --> 04:27:28,129
Just get a bunch of milk? It's not a bad idea. Is that it? There can't be any more of these guys.

1457
04:27:28,129 --> 04:27:43,299
Seriously. All right, this is... I can get orange juice. I think I'm going full on orange juice.

1458
04:27:47,399 --> 04:28:14,049
Yeah. All right, two full guns. The chainsaw. Give her the clean. Pretty nice throw. All right,

1459
04:28:14,049 --> 04:28:24,229
so I got insane amount of health. All right, I'm just gonna drink... I said muc. I'm gonna drink

1460
04:28:24,229 --> 04:28:43,459
milk until I puke. Time check. This is the most military I've seen anywhere. They're all in the

1461
04:28:43,459 --> 04:29:01,829
grocery store. Is that 10? 12 military in the grocery store? Okay. I bet that guy die. Shoes.

1462
04:29:01,829 --> 04:29:37,030
I'll be taking this. No, no, I won't. Motorcycle. Where am I going? He's just driving around a

1463
04:29:37,030 --> 04:29:50,040
circle. I forget where it is. It's over here. Did I get actually stopped by like the ribbons?

1464
04:29:50,760 --> 04:30:24,559
I have to save it. Four. Hey, I'm back. Shoes now. Shoes now. Shut. Helipad at 11, not 12.

1465
04:30:25,280 --> 04:30:40,790
I'll get there. Go get the chainsaw books. Nice fish at the end. Thank you for that.

1466
04:30:41,909 --> 04:30:55,120
Where are the chainsaw books? Grab a zombie and give them a good shove.

1467
04:30:55,200 --> 04:31:21,860
Press X and A simultaneously while standing at a zombie's side. What? Did I do it?

1468
04:31:25,379 --> 04:31:28,340
Oh look, that's me in the zombie apocalypse. Remember from yesterday?

1469
04:31:29,200 --> 04:31:32,799
Jeremy, you have like no awareness. You would die. Yeah, this is what you think I'm gonna do.

1470
04:31:35,329 --> 04:31:55,969
Not that. You already saw it. This. Now I'm gonna turn around. I'm gonna go... I want the motorcycle

1471
04:31:55,969 --> 04:32:16,739
first of all. Motorcycle time. The military respawn, I would assume. Oh my fucking god.

1472
04:32:19,969 --> 04:32:51,329
Get the hell away from me. Suction cup zombie, the video game. They're like octopuses. No, I

1473
04:32:51,329 --> 04:33:11,169
want to take them. All right, let's go. I want the motorcycle, which is down here. Straight ahead.

1474
04:33:11,729 --> 04:33:29,729
I looked over and glanced over and just read, are you going to pee before playing Dead Rising 2?

1475
04:33:29,729 --> 04:33:39,860
I'm just sitting there thinking, uh, yeah, probably. I would think so. I would hope so.

1476
04:33:40,740 --> 04:34:08,610
Should I get the second chainsaw? I'm gonna get the second chainsaw. Uh, let's replace.

1477
04:34:09,409 --> 04:34:24,200
All right, I have room for it. Okay. I got on my neck. Frank, you got so far.

1478
04:34:25,000 --> 04:35:28,000
I'm stuck. No, shit. Oh, fuck. We got a backup. Oh, you got more backup. How many are gonna come up

1479
04:35:28,000 --> 04:35:40,930
here? The fourth? You're gonna get like six? How many? Okay, this is number four. Any others in the

1480
04:35:40,930 --> 04:35:57,959
area that you'd like to call for? I'll wait for it. Found him. Where's the fifth guy? Come on.

1481
04:35:58,599 --> 04:36:42,319
Let me have this. They're leaving. All right, I've had enough. He has his watching. Is that it?

1482
04:36:42,560 --> 04:36:46,319
That was a stream sniper.

1483
04:36:55,380 --> 04:36:59,639
Oh, that's fucking funny. All right. Can I actually not get this out of here?

1484
04:37:01,810 --> 04:37:35,590
Hi. That's okay. No, I can't. It's over. Shoot metal. All right. Well, I just Wario'd my bike

1485
04:37:35,590 --> 04:38:08,200
from Smash Brothers. Are you happy? No, I was standing here. All right. Time for... What are

1486
04:38:08,200 --> 04:38:14,790
you guys doing behind in the toy store? These two guys are just hanging out behind of the cache here.

1487
04:38:15,430 --> 04:38:39,729
Okay. Leave them alone. No, it's time to get shoes. What time is it? Five. I wish I had that

1488
04:38:39,729 --> 04:38:53,139
motorcycle. That would be really great right now. Shoes. What about over here? Food court. I'm gonna

1489
04:38:53,139 --> 04:39:20,419
go back. I'm gonna go. I'm gonna. Yeah, I'm gonna go to the food court. Almost a little 32. Where is

1490
04:39:20,419 --> 04:39:26,639
he going up there? I'm gonna make a couple more smoothies with the orange juice so I have more

1491
04:39:26,639 --> 04:39:35,029
room and then I could do... Oh, hold on. I can do this. Wait. Oh, hold on. What about... Okay, zucchini.

1492
04:39:36,580 --> 04:39:53,490
Okay. Hear me out. Zucchini and corn. All right. Let's try that. Keep the guns. I'll get... Don't

1493
04:39:53,490 --> 04:40:07,840
worry. I'll have plenty of them. These guys are lying around dead everywhere. All these guys do

1494
04:40:07,840 --> 04:40:40,419
is just request the emergency dunces. Okay. And bring the wine too. All right. I should get

1495
04:40:40,419 --> 04:40:45,459
something interesting out of this. Fuck. You guys. Are they just spawning? I think they're spawning.

1496
04:40:46,419 --> 04:41:11,299
More stock. Any more wine? No. Can I please just blend in peace? More corn. All right. Oh,

1497
04:41:11,299 --> 04:41:18,290
let's get rid of one of these guns. There we go. Blender. Here we are. All right. Here we go. Let's

1498
04:41:18,290 --> 04:41:35,080
do corn and orange juice. Zucchini and orange juice. Corn and zucchini. Corn and orange juice.

1499
04:41:35,799 --> 04:41:58,130
Wine and corn. Corn and corn. Let's do corn and orange juice. It's a nectar. How about zucchini

1500
04:41:59,459 --> 04:42:09,639
and corn? That's different. Spitfire. I still don't even know what this does.

1501
04:42:10,759 --> 04:42:36,279
How about... We have an ingredient in here. How about flour and orange juice? How about... That's

1502
04:42:36,279 --> 04:43:02,049
a big knife. I got enough. Okay. I can get two guns. Knife and chainsaw. That's not how this

1503
04:43:02,049 --> 04:43:07,830
works. All right. So I have wine and... I gotta do one of the things. There's gotta be one other

1504
04:43:07,830 --> 04:43:11,110
ingredient lying around somewhere, like right here. There we go. Wine and corn.

1505
04:43:31,490 --> 04:43:40,259
Cash register and gun. Oh, there we go. There's a quick step. That's very useful. Energizer.

1506
04:43:44,919 --> 04:43:57,040
Although... So I got one, two, three, four, five full heels, two super chainsaws, and a huge amount

1507
04:43:57,040 --> 04:44:05,680
of guns. And we got six o'clock. I got a couple hours. I'm gonna head... I'm gonna make my way back.

1508
04:44:06,319 --> 04:44:11,319
Let's go. I'm gonna go back to Isabella, because that's the right thing to do,

1509
04:44:11,959 --> 04:44:18,580
because it's gonna take me a little while to get up there. Straight up. Save the game. Up there.

1510
04:44:19,299 --> 04:44:33,250
If there's a place to get shoes, I will get them. And they have to be actually on the way. I'm gonna

1511
04:44:33,250 --> 04:44:42,259
replace this cleaver, by the way. I actually don't even have a cleaver. Never mind. Shoes. Casual

1512
04:44:42,259 --> 04:45:17,569
gals. There may have been somebody in here at one point. Shoes of a lifetime. I can't take any of

1513
04:45:17,569 --> 04:45:44,599
these shoes. All right. Save point. I went to two shoe stores. Am I hitting the wall?

1514
04:46:00,080 --> 04:46:03,619
That's the threat. That's what you should have been shooting at. Good work.

1515
04:46:05,250 --> 04:46:10,209
The zombie walking around at one mile per hour was the real threat. Not the guy unloading a full

1516
04:46:10,209 --> 04:46:29,279
magazine into your body. These guys are great. Shoes! There's no shoes. No shoes. I'm sorry, guys.

1517
04:46:33,830 --> 04:46:52,360
Save point right here. All right. All the way at the top. The first one is the real save point.

1518
04:46:52,360 --> 04:46:56,450
I have to go to the dressing room? Yeah, but it doesn't take off all my clothes. I don't want

1519
04:46:56,450 --> 04:47:18,229
to lose my red dyed hair in my white suit. Leave me alone. I got the... Now this is gonna be great.

1520
04:47:18,229 --> 04:47:31,060
Check this out. Actually, I don't want to use any heels at the moment. Let me slow down. So then,

1521
04:47:31,060 --> 04:47:48,680
I'm gonna get the motorcycle and ride it back. Could be good, right? In fact, I'm just gonna go

1522
04:47:48,680 --> 04:48:02,180
to the grocery store and just drink orange juice until it's time to go. That sounds like a pretty

1523
04:48:02,180 --> 04:48:13,110
good idea right now. The military? Just making sure there's no military. There are military,

1524
04:48:13,110 --> 04:48:35,360
but they're not here. Let's go. All right, I gotta get in the corner here. Yeah, just drink.

1525
04:48:35,360 --> 04:48:48,369
I just got this shit out of me. All right, there's a lot more in here. I gotta get a gun.

1526
04:48:49,189 --> 04:49:29,090
Where are they? Two more coming down the aisle. There they are. Uh-oh. Where's the other gun?

1527
04:49:29,090 --> 04:49:47,119
I killed them up here. Come on, where's the machine gun? Hurry up. Come on. Here we go. Bitch,

1528
04:49:47,119 --> 04:50:45,880
get out of my way. Fuck me. No, don't you dare! Where's this other guy? This military dude? There's

1529
04:50:45,880 --> 04:51:07,590
two over here. Dead. All right, is that it? Is this what I have this whole place to myself? Now,

1530
04:51:07,590 --> 04:51:43,189
I'm just gonna eat bread until I shit my pants. All right, done. I do want like two more orange

1531
04:51:43,189 --> 04:52:07,720
juices. Raw meat. I'm worse than a zombie right now. All right, I'm good to go. The plan is to

1532
04:52:07,720 --> 04:52:22,529
leave here with two machine guns. Take an orange juice. I'm gonna test it. So replace. Give me...

1533
04:52:23,409 --> 04:52:29,000
I need a better one than this. All right, there we go. Good. What do we got for time? Seven,

1534
04:52:29,000 --> 04:52:50,930
almost eight. Uh-oh. It's getting to be late. I need a machine gun with 150. 150 in both. Good.

1535
04:52:51,970 --> 04:53:04,419
All right, motorcycle time. And it's time to go to Isabella. And the motorcycle actually will

1536
04:53:04,419 --> 04:53:32,000
not be there when I get back, will it? So, hmm. Try jump. How do I not do the down stop?

1537
04:53:33,119 --> 04:53:55,830
Oh, I want someone to explain it to me, right? That's what I usually say. All right, I'm here.

1538
04:53:55,830 --> 04:54:05,599
I'm gonna save it. And then we're just gonna hang out. I'm at the end game. I'm almost at the

1539
04:54:06,720 --> 04:54:29,360
finale. Eight o'clock. Face cam. I will. You know what? Let me take this opportunity. I'm

1540
04:54:29,360 --> 04:54:35,830
gonna go pee one more time. I'll be right back. You can just watch the clock. I'll be back by

1541
04:54:36,389 --> 04:57:00,400
nine. See? I thought you'd be back before nine. This is kind of nice, actually. I've been so up

1542
04:57:00,400 --> 04:57:17,759
against the clock that all I have to do now is just wait. We want hair content. Can you imagine

1543
04:57:17,759 --> 04:57:25,080
somebody telling you, hey, can you meet me back here at 10 a.m.? You say, yeah, that sounds like

1544
04:57:25,080 --> 04:57:29,959
a plan. I sure will meet you here at 10 a.m. You go, all right, bye. See you later. We're gonna do

1545
04:57:29,959 --> 04:57:43,240
lunch. And you get, you like go, standing outside like the restaurant, just going like this

1546
04:57:44,680 --> 04:57:53,909
for two hours. And you show up like five, 10 minutes early. And the fucking person is just

1547
04:57:53,909 --> 04:58:00,279
standing there going like this. And you're like, hey, you want to start early? And this is like

1548
04:58:00,279 --> 04:58:10,790
in their own world. Or imagine like, hey, I'll pick you up at eight. Or I'll pick you up at 10.

1549
04:58:11,509 --> 04:58:22,919
Meet here. And you just stand here and do this. Oh my god. Okay, nine a.m. Wait, can I fight up here?

1550
04:58:30,979 --> 04:58:36,259
When your villagers want to come over in Animal Crossing, you just sit there and just stare at

1551
04:58:36,259 --> 04:58:40,900
the clock. Wash my hair. I actually used a different conditioner today and it's like weighing it down.

1552
04:58:41,459 --> 04:59:02,819
I won't be using it again. When you talk to her, there's just a normal text box.

1553
04:59:03,459 --> 04:59:14,799
Okay. Somebody just gave money. Ishanji gave 5,000 bits. Thank you, Ishanji. And they say,

1554
04:59:15,439 --> 04:59:24,020
very, very, very good stream today. You didn't get flaccid locked at all. Terminator 5,000.

1555
04:59:28,130 --> 04:59:40,689
Thank you for the 5,000 bits. Thanks for the Terminator bits. Is the new Terminator movie good?

1556
04:59:41,490 --> 04:59:50,740
Is it out yet? No, that was the most unanimous no I think I've ever seen.

1557
04:59:53,270 --> 04:59:57,029
Usually one person in chat will be like, I'm gonna be contrarian and say yes. I think that was like

1558
04:59:57,029 --> 05:00:12,500
600 no's in a row. Damn. But thank you, Ishanji. Thanks for the 5,000 bits, man. Wait, I have to

1559
05:00:12,500 --> 05:00:35,590
go through my photos and see which ones I like. You know what I'm saying? Delete. Hmm. This is

1560
05:00:35,590 --> 05:00:40,880
just terrible. This is just, I don't like... That one's okay. This one's better because the

1561
05:00:41,360 --> 05:00:48,240
neck is like turned completely upside down. It's like when a dog hears a strange noise.

1562
05:00:49,729 --> 05:00:55,490
Or when you start talking to your dog and you start talking in a weird voice instead of going

1563
05:00:55,490 --> 05:01:02,369
like, hey, like Otto, you go like, hey, you're Otto. And they're like, what the fuck are you doing?

1564
05:01:09,909 --> 05:01:22,659
They get gamer neck. I'm like, hello, Otto, Otto, Otto. And he's just like, can somebody tell me

1565
05:01:22,659 --> 05:01:26,979
what happened? I was in the shower and didn't see what happened to her. Oh, that's a spoiler.

1566
05:01:36,200 --> 05:01:50,930
It's just blood. This is the girl that fell down. I actually quite like this. I like that one.

1567
05:01:51,490 --> 05:02:03,990
I like this one too. I like the guys on the left. This is a perfect photo of how the AI in this

1568
05:02:03,990 --> 05:02:10,959
game is fucking stupid. It's every person is doing something else that was aggravating during the

1569
05:02:10,959 --> 05:02:18,479
course of the game. Guy on left just standing staring blankly won't move. Lady with the sword

1570
05:02:18,479 --> 05:02:22,740
in the back that has a weapon that's running in a completely opposite direction scared. Person with

1571
05:02:22,740 --> 05:02:25,380
the gun in the middle that you give the gun to hoping they'll do something. They're looking at

1572
05:02:25,380 --> 05:02:32,819
the sky and a gun is pointed towards the floor. Lady in the front is angry and pissed off and

1573
05:02:33,909 --> 05:02:41,680
won't listen to you. And guy is hiding behind her to not get killed. Or in fact, you know,

1574
05:02:41,680 --> 05:02:48,240
that person might just be stuck in the middle. Keep this one. This is my favorite picture of

1575
05:02:48,240 --> 05:03:06,580
the whole entire game. This guy's Peyton Manning. Nationwide is on your side. There he is again.

1576
05:03:07,220 --> 05:03:18,319
Is that an explosion over there? Why is Nathan always just somehow sort of in the picture?

1577
05:03:18,880 --> 05:03:33,360
It's like he doesn't want to be on camera. He's like dodging. Keep that one for sure.

1578
05:03:33,360 --> 05:03:38,400
Keep them both. I like this one because this is this is like me and you decided to do like a shoot

1579
05:03:39,040 --> 05:03:41,729
and I'm doing different angles and telling you to do the same pose.

1580
05:03:42,529 --> 05:04:08,790
I'll keep Ronald. Keep the mirror. Keep, okay, keep like the transition into pants.

1581
05:04:10,930 --> 05:04:18,709
No, this is just a dream he's having. All right, I want to keep like the dream.

1582
05:04:21,270 --> 05:04:27,959
Rock bottom off the Titan Tron. Absolutely. And I've had this one since the very beginning.

1583
05:04:27,959 --> 05:04:38,290
And it's the first like photo I took. I think those are keepers. I kept this one, right? Yep.

1584
05:04:38,849 --> 05:04:49,939
Take that. Wait, do I? I might need it. No, I don't. The game's over. Okay. Did I just

1585
05:04:49,939 --> 05:04:57,830
burn some time or was it paused? Am I gonna play Dead Rising 2? I would say at this point,

1586
05:04:57,830 --> 05:05:13,889
absolutely yes. We'll see where we can fit it in over the next like month or so. Dead Rising 2

1587
05:05:13,889 --> 05:05:20,549
sucks. I don't remember being bad, although I did only play like two or three hours of it.

1588
05:05:21,110 --> 05:05:27,330
That's the one guy. That actually kind of was a one guy opinion. Yeah, you're right.

1589
05:05:27,970 --> 05:05:36,599
I hope you guys weren't lying to me and I hope this is really actually gonna happen.

1590
05:05:37,240 --> 05:05:44,119
What about Dead Rising 3? Once we go past 2, we're really gonna have to see if people are

1591
05:05:44,360 --> 05:05:49,189
exhausted with Dead Rising. I'm gonna try to break them up to a point where it doesn't happen

1592
05:05:49,189 --> 05:05:56,630
immediately, but I don't remember Dead Rising 3 being very good. That's when they made the change

1593
05:05:56,630 --> 05:06:12,310
to like new generations, right? Like Xbox One. 3 is meh, 4 is bad. I remember playing one of them,

1594
05:06:12,310 --> 05:06:17,430
maybe even on stream. I think I did stream the fourth one. I'm getting like these weird

1595
05:06:17,430 --> 05:06:23,400
flashbacks of actually playing the fourth one on stream. I made a video on the third game,

1596
05:06:23,479 --> 05:06:30,400
but the fourth one though? I remember there was a guy like you have like this machine gun

1597
05:06:31,750 --> 05:06:36,150
and there's a person up on like a rafter and you're shooting like a minigun at them and I

1598
05:06:36,150 --> 05:06:43,349
remember saying this game sucks. I remember being like this is fucking stupid. This is terrible.

1599
05:06:44,150 --> 05:07:00,119
It was at that moment is what I remember. That's 4. Okay, almost time. You made a video on the

1600
05:07:00,119 --> 05:07:06,599
fourth one as well. Maybe that was like one of the last. Yeah, I'm sorry. I just don't remember. I

1601
05:07:06,599 --> 05:07:13,159
remember like if whether it was a video or stream, I just remember doing it. Save it right here.

1602
05:07:13,880 --> 05:07:24,369
Never played this one though all the way through. I'm gonna go all the way to the bottom.

1603
05:07:25,090 --> 05:07:34,369
I wonder if they'll do a Dead Rising 5 after people are just like meh. Like the last two

1604
05:07:34,369 --> 05:07:42,159
weren't very good. I wonder if we'll get another one. You can't throw stuff in Dead Rising 4. Now

1605
05:07:42,159 --> 05:07:55,590
that's a reason to just refund the game immediately when you get it. Maybe we'll get a like back to

1606
05:07:55,590 --> 05:08:16,290
Formula Dead Rising 5. That'd be kind of cool. Have they talked about it at all? Almost 10. All

1607
05:08:16,290 --> 05:08:27,159
right, I'm ready. I got the face cam on for the final like fight. 4 was basically a soft reboot

1608
05:08:27,159 --> 05:08:35,799
and they fucked it up. Yeah, that's unfortunate. They advertised 4 as back to Formula. There we go

1609
05:08:40,389 --> 05:09:03,119
and two hours. Well that's kind of what they're saying with like Diablo 4 and I mean that game's

1610
05:09:03,119 --> 05:09:09,799
like four years out probably. Hey, we're going back to like the, you remember Diablo 2? You loved

1611
05:09:09,799 --> 05:09:17,759
Diablo 2. Remember how dark and scary it was and how much blood there was? It's like, I mean yeah,

1612
05:09:17,759 --> 05:09:25,909
I kind of, you loved that game and we're gonna go back there. It's like well okay, we'll see

1613
05:09:25,909 --> 05:09:39,619
what you do in five years when it comes out. All right, 10 a.m. Let's go. It's almost time. Don't

1614
05:09:39,619 --> 05:10:08,209
worry about me. Save yourself. Is that, that's what I had to do? To the helipad now. All right,

1615
05:10:08,209 --> 05:10:17,200
I'm gonna grab motorcycle and I'm gonna get the hell out of here. Can I go there? What's the

1616
05:10:17,200 --> 05:10:23,000
fastest way? Straight and then straight. You had to do this or else a guy doesn't show up.

1617
05:10:23,560 --> 05:10:36,580
It seems a little strange. All right, motorcycle. Give it to me. The one guy? That was definitely

1618
05:10:36,580 --> 05:10:44,479
not one guy telling me to talk to her at 10 a.m. If by one guy you mean like one collective group

1619
05:10:44,479 --> 05:10:53,119
of humans that were all in this chat at the same time. Please tell me the motorcycle's still there.

1620
05:10:53,119 --> 05:11:07,889
It is. The lights are all on. All right, let's go. So we're gonna go straight out this way.

1621
05:11:11,590 --> 05:11:24,580
Yeah, just around the corner. Okay, straight. And then through the park. Is it this way, right? Yeah,

1622
05:11:24,580 --> 05:11:44,159
okay. Can I leave here with this? I can't, can I? Oh, that's stupid. All right, whatever.

1623
05:11:44,639 --> 05:11:58,209
At least it took me far. It took me far. Bang a left. Yeah, no song. Everything's dead and no song.

1624
05:12:03,720 --> 05:12:26,049
I'll save it too before I go through. Nice and sunny out though. That's a good thing. All right,

1625
05:12:26,049 --> 05:12:44,080
and then straight this way. I'm gonna save it right here. Shoes. No shoes in there. No shoes in

1626
05:12:44,080 --> 05:12:56,150
there. It has to be on the way. I can't put on anything. I can't. What am I trying to do?

1627
05:12:56,790 --> 05:13:09,810
All right, we got a save point right there. That was literally a shoe store.

1628
05:13:11,509 --> 05:13:38,229
The old toy box and toys for children? They're on. First time I've worn shoes. All game. Now I'm

1629
05:13:38,229 --> 05:14:01,080
ready to absolutely destroy the end of this game. One hour. Let's go to the helipad. Just a clean

1630
05:14:01,080 --> 05:14:07,700
run. That's good. Although I kind of want some to eat. Well, that should be fine. Is there food in

1631
05:14:07,700 --> 05:14:15,520
this box right here with food in it, right? Yeah, not very good food, but it's something.

1632
05:14:16,159 --> 05:14:36,240
Let's go. Am I gonna play Luigi's Mansion 3? Probably not. Not on stream at least.

1633
05:14:38,849 --> 05:14:53,490
Actually, I can save it here too. Any more notes? I mean, it looks all right. It looks fun,

1634
05:14:54,130 --> 05:15:01,639
but I hadn't played really the first or the second one. So it'd be like kind of just jumping in

1635
05:15:02,439 --> 05:15:06,439
to the third game. It's not that I don't want to play it.

1636
05:15:07,159 --> 05:15:25,509
Okay, that's good. Now let's go up. Which way is it? This way? How the hell do I get up? Here we go.

1637
05:15:25,509 --> 05:15:52,479
Eleven o'clock. I'm here. I'm ready for the helicopter to pick me up. I missed it. No, I didn't.

1638
05:15:52,479 --> 05:16:26,930
It's at an hour. 1101. I did miss it. No emotion for one hour. Nice to be a weirdo. Nice kill count.

1639
05:16:26,930 --> 05:16:34,310
3412. That's not good for just a one-off playthrough. I do have lots of heals though.

1640
05:16:35,029 --> 05:16:41,240
I should be fine. It's because daylight savings time. I'm just gonna hide up here.

1641
05:16:41,880 --> 05:16:45,119
All right, do I have to wait? Do I have to be physically standing on the helipad?

1642
05:16:51,349 --> 05:17:22,360
Yes. All right, I'm gonna go right in the middle of the H. 1120. Actually, that is like a stupid

1643
05:17:22,360 --> 05:18:04,180
thing I just did, but it's not an actual like organized inventory. You know, so I can act like,

1644
05:18:04,180 --> 05:18:10,500
oh, melee. I'm not cycling all over the place to find stuff. I mean, it's categorized.

1645
05:18:11,139 --> 05:18:33,080
Juices aren't organized next to each other. I did it by type and then color. No, that looks

1646
05:18:33,080 --> 05:18:39,400
much better than there being. No, it's like orange. Four orange in a row and then white,

1647
05:18:39,400 --> 05:18:45,299
then dark blue. Opposite ends of the color spectrum. You guys don't know color theory?

1648
05:18:46,020 --> 05:19:13,540
15 minutes. Slime him. He said orange. Not today. All right, what would it take? What would it take,

1649
05:19:13,540 --> 05:19:21,669
do you think, for me to throw all my items over the edge? Just throw all my healing and the,

1650
05:19:21,669 --> 05:19:35,319
just throw everything over the fence. Don't do it. All right, I'll throw one orange juice.

1651
05:19:42,040 --> 05:19:51,590
There's no way. Don't. Don't do it. Don't do it. I'm gonna throw the orange juice over the cliff.

1652
05:19:53,349 --> 05:20:36,639
I have five minutes to decide if I'm gonna throw the orange juice. Did I do it? I did it.

1653
05:20:40,770 --> 05:21:00,549
Where's the helicopter? It's gonna be Otis. The orange juice gets thrown back over.

1654
05:21:13,990 --> 05:21:56,310
Let's go. Boom! Missile. Right? That's what happens in these games. This is the setup for these

1655
05:21:56,310 --> 05:22:11,380
deaths. It's over. It's gonna get shot down. I knew it. I told you. I knew it. Do I have to fly the

1656
05:22:11,380 --> 05:22:17,639
helicopter? Way too much celebrating before anything. Way too much yeah, yeah, oh yeah,

1657
05:22:18,279 --> 05:22:35,380
oh yeah, yeah, yeah. It's over. I lose. Way too much yeah, here we go. Like, get your hands on the

1658
05:22:35,380 --> 05:22:52,119
wheel. I don't know. Something was in my view. Something distracted me. It looked like an orange.

1659
05:22:53,159 --> 05:23:05,029
Did I actually lose? So the whole game is based around the helicopter pilot doesn't get bit by

1660
05:23:05,029 --> 05:23:27,349
a fucking zombie at the last 30 seconds. I don't get out. What? Yeah! Nice work everybody.

1661
05:23:28,610 --> 05:23:35,700
Wait a minute. The guy from stage right is gonna bite me. You wasted three days.

1662
05:23:36,500 --> 05:23:59,860
We told you not to throw the orange juice. It's not over. I have overtime. What? They're gonna

1663
05:24:00,500 --> 05:24:24,799
get another helicopter? What did you do? I didn't do anything. It's not the end, really.

1664
05:24:33,299 --> 05:24:51,040
That's so funny. This five endings, you just got the Brad ending, but this ain't bad.

1665
05:24:52,479 --> 05:25:26,639
That is the canon ending. Why didn't you get more erotic points? Does it count how many pictures,

1666
05:25:26,639 --> 05:25:40,900
like how many points I had? Jeremy's a prude. No, I took plenty of photos. We'll just put it that way.

1667
05:25:41,619 --> 05:26:02,759
You did great, Jeremy. I'm proud of you. Thank you. All right. Was more? Let's see. I'm willing to

1668
05:26:02,759 --> 05:26:34,389
give it a keep going. Oh, by the way, now we need content. You've been looking at, yeah,

1669
05:26:34,389 --> 05:26:36,549
I wish you could see the faces I'm making right now into the camera.

1670
05:26:39,830 --> 05:26:55,139
Nope. Okay. Exclamation point. Turn on cam. It's going to be an actual, a new command that if it

1671
05:26:55,139 --> 05:27:13,759
happens 50,000 fucking times, the webcam will turn on. Oh, you guys are really hammering this,

1672
05:27:13,759 --> 05:27:26,639
huh? All right. Hey, hey, PP earned two million ending a bonus. 50,000 PP, zombie kill count,

1673
05:27:26,639 --> 05:27:38,279
15,000 PP, photo score bonus, bonus current. I just got a lot of survivor chart. Am I playing

1674
05:27:38,360 --> 05:27:56,680
guess who? Brad is up there. Barnaby's up there. You, Barnaby can survive too.

1675
05:27:58,639 --> 05:28:10,549
Who made it? Tad, Alyssa, Jonathan, and Brett, all dead. And if I'm honest,

1676
05:28:11,110 --> 05:28:26,979
good. I don't remember coming. Oh, Ronald dead. Wait, why am I dead? I'm dead. Frank is dead.

1677
05:28:26,979 --> 05:28:45,139
What? Wait, I'm dead? How did I die? Brutality, 29. Drama, 44. Erotica,

1678
05:28:45,139 --> 05:28:54,930
eight. Take what? Horror, 76. I didn't take any.

1679
05:28:57,919 --> 05:29:05,240
That's funny. End? Special forces boots have been added to the security room. Overtime mode has

1680
05:29:05,240 --> 05:29:11,090
been added to the title screen. Choose save game slot and save Frank's status. When you begin a new

1681
05:29:11,090 --> 05:30:04,200
game, you can play with Frank's current status. I got, I unlocked shoes. Wait, what's the matter

1682
05:30:04,200 --> 05:30:10,759
with me? Oh no, he's been up here. He's been up here for two days and he's only had orange juice.

1683
05:30:13,909 --> 05:30:23,959
Why didn't you bring any meat or any vegetables? And what's that I see over the balcony? A full

1684
05:30:23,959 --> 05:30:34,159
orange juice. It wasn't easy getting you back here by myself, you know. All right, Frank's still

1685
05:30:34,159 --> 05:30:58,790
alive. Lapsed on the roof. Wait, does that mean? Why would I not remember this? Didn't this happen

1686
05:30:58,790 --> 05:31:09,250
like 42 minutes ago? Orange juice overdose? Orange juice hangover. I don't know. I just don't remember.

1687
05:31:12,310 --> 05:31:29,509
You have gotten yourself infected somehow. That's the way every character laughs before

1688
05:31:29,509 --> 05:31:33,509
they do something insane. The time between infection and zombification differs greatly

1689
05:31:33,509 --> 05:31:40,290
from person to person. You're lucky, Frank. You seem to have a very high level of resistance.

1690
05:31:42,799 --> 05:31:53,189
So, uh, so what you're saying is that I get to spend longer waiting for the inevitable. Is that it?

1691
05:31:56,229 --> 05:32:07,000
You know, I'm not sure lucky is the word I'd use. I can't wait to get the super boots.

1692
05:32:07,720 --> 05:32:11,650
Are they there now or do I have to actually go to a different game mode?

1693
05:32:12,290 --> 05:32:48,500
A helicopter crashed. No one's coming to help us now. It's over for us. What we do. I can't believe

1694
05:32:48,500 --> 05:32:58,119
that I unlocked super shoes. The game was taunting me. What if there was some way to impede the

1695
05:32:58,119 --> 05:33:06,119
infection? I feel like you guys made that happen. Could extract and administer a large dose of

1696
05:33:06,119 --> 05:33:11,729
hormones from the corpus alatum of an adult queen. It would potentially hinder the growth

1697
05:33:11,729 --> 05:33:16,450
of the larva in your blood, retarding the zombification problem. Hang on a sec. I don't

1698
05:33:16,450 --> 05:33:21,889
understand a word you just said. What are we supposed to do? I'll need certain supplies to

1699
05:33:21,889 --> 05:33:27,490
get this to work. And queens. How many queens? As many as you can get your hands on. All right.

1700
05:33:28,209 --> 05:33:40,389
Uh, can you, can you say like eight? Sounds like a plan. It's sitting around here waiting to die.

1701
05:33:40,389 --> 05:34:02,159
Did time go backwards? 24 hours remain until frank zombification. What do you mean 24 hours

1702
05:34:02,159 --> 05:34:28,849
remain? All right. I got, uh, that's 33. All the way to the bottom. So I have to do this.

1703
05:34:30,840 --> 05:34:39,119
What in the name of God is going on here? Um, first aid kit, blender, coffee filters,

1704
05:34:39,919 --> 05:35:13,779
magnet. Let's go. All right. Cold spray. Where are, okay. Let me see where these all are.

1705
05:35:14,580 --> 05:35:18,340
I'm going to say we're going to grocery store down and we're going to wrap around a complete

1706
05:35:18,340 --> 05:35:33,590
circle. And we're going here this way. Grocery store first. Bang left. What is this? This is

1707
05:35:33,590 --> 05:36:13,619
not over time. This is, there are drones. Wonderful. Are they military too? There is.

1708
05:36:13,619 --> 05:36:19,540
It's just military and drones for the rest of the game. I'm getting the motorcycle and just

1709
05:36:19,540 --> 05:36:50,400
driving around. I hear a drone. I hear drone. I hear drone. How do I stop the drone? Holy

1710
05:36:50,400 --> 05:37:04,930
shit. That was really easy. I need to go into the grocery store. Turn around. And then I'm

1711
05:37:04,930 --> 05:37:19,119
going to go down with the motorcycle. What if I just don't even care? Just run. Ooh,

1712
05:37:19,119 --> 05:37:44,500
I got to kill this guy. Get in. The motorcycle is still here. All right. What was, what is actually

1713
05:37:44,500 --> 05:38:16,630
in this though? Oh man. I'm a pain in the ass. There's no better way to kill these guys than

1714
05:38:16,630 --> 05:38:26,209
just to unload like this. All right. What am I looking for? A chainsaw, but they'll shoot me.

1715
05:38:26,209 --> 05:38:46,979
All right. Pharmacy. Save the chainsaws. Yeah, I think so too. Okay. First aid kit. There it is.

1716
05:38:46,979 --> 05:38:54,020
You obtained first aid kit. Keep going. Grab motorcycle. Go straight down into the jewelry

1717
05:38:54,020 --> 05:39:25,430
store. It's as easy as that. Emergency backup. This is going to fill up. I'm going to drink the

1718
05:39:25,430 --> 05:39:31,270
milk and get an orange juice and then leave. In fact, get two orange juices.

1719
05:39:31,270 --> 05:40:08,450
Is that attack increased to 200%. Does that include guns too? That sounds like a lot.

1720
05:40:09,009 --> 05:40:33,540
All right. Take another orange juice. Two is fine. Let's go. I got plenty of time. So the idea is

1721
05:40:33,540 --> 05:40:44,049
just to go bang a right and go straight down. Hopefully keep the motorcycle with me as long as

1722
05:40:44,049 --> 05:40:56,020
I can. And then where's this next one? Down or up? Looks like it's just to the right.

1723
05:40:56,659 --> 05:41:20,799
I'm just looking at necklaces. Good. What am I looking for? Right there. Magnifying glass. Got it.

1724
05:41:26,400 --> 05:41:35,650
Um, you're going to think I'm crazy for this, but I'm not going to save the game because I'll lose

1725
05:41:35,650 --> 05:41:49,990
the bike. I'm going to save the game when I'm at the last place. All right. Food court. Straight

1726
05:41:49,990 --> 05:42:21,970
ahead. Blender. I can't make any more drinks. Keep going. Come out out of here. Wrap around.

1727
05:42:21,970 --> 05:42:28,229
All right. I think I have to lose the motorcycle. Yep. I think. Yeah, I do. Go straight through

1728
05:42:29,119 --> 05:42:44,919
down the entrance plaza. Pick up the bike. I can't pick it up. Okay. Now I've got a save

1729
05:42:44,919 --> 05:43:13,880
point to the right. I'm going to use it. Quick step. Not yet. I don't need it. Where's the drone? I

1730
05:43:13,880 --> 05:43:38,069
could hear it. Where's the drone? There it is. Not reaching. Yeah. Get on the treadmill. Get on the

1731
05:43:38,069 --> 05:44:13,409
treadmill. Get on the... Got it. There's nothing in here. It's all in the entrance plaza. Essentially

1732
05:44:13,409 --> 05:44:18,319
I'm as bad as it could have been. So this is just a way for you to just keep playing and messing

1733
05:44:18,319 --> 05:44:34,630
around. That's kind of cool. Although the one thing I would say is... Holy shit. Holy shit.

1734
05:44:34,630 --> 05:44:50,479
Holy shit. Holy shit. Not a chainsaw. Drink. Oh, it's two hits. You gotta be kidding me.

1735
05:44:55,650 --> 05:45:02,310
You gotta get real close though. All right. I get to replace it. That's so awesome.

1736
05:45:02,950 --> 05:45:26,130
Makes me so happy. It's like I didn't even do anything. Let's go. 22 hours until zombification.

1737
05:45:26,930 --> 05:45:46,869
I guess there's a couple places here. Drones. I hear it. Where are you? This one's definitely up.

1738
05:45:47,509 --> 05:45:51,860
If they took inventory slots, this would be pretty much impossible.

1739
05:45:58,900 --> 05:46:01,619
It wouldn't be actually impossible, but it would be sort of impossible.

1740
05:46:02,979 --> 05:46:19,400
Where is this up here? Cosmetics. There it is. Perfume. And then straight down.

1741
05:46:19,959 --> 05:46:33,189
There's a save point in there too. Who cut the lights? Gotta go all the way down. All the way.

1742
05:46:37,840 --> 05:46:50,319
Oh, my little fetch quest. I actually would rather there be zombies. Because these guys are annoying,

1743
05:46:51,680 --> 05:46:56,159
but their danger only actually comes out if there's more than two or three of them all

1744
05:46:56,159 --> 05:47:07,250
aiming at you at the same time. They just sort of walk in straight lines. Where is this person?

1745
05:47:11,000 --> 05:47:21,110
So they're like a zombie. Yeah, but these guys can do like four cheese slices of health in one second.

1746
05:47:21,830 --> 05:47:28,419
Takes a lot longer for a zombie to do that. All right. This door right here and then right across

1747
05:47:28,419 --> 05:47:44,020
the street. What is it? Tie? Shirt? In the back room. Yeah, just be glad they can't grab you.

1748
05:47:44,020 --> 05:47:58,689
That's true. That would suck. Am I in the wrong store? Is it below me? I think it's below me.

1749
05:47:59,409 --> 05:48:38,049
Groomens? Hammer? A bicycle? How have I not found this at all this whole time? Did I get distracted

1750
05:48:38,049 --> 05:49:00,369
by the bicycle? What was it? It's right here. What is it? The shelves? Camp stove. Okay. Give me the

1751
05:49:00,369 --> 05:49:32,869
bike. This is gonna end very badly. Can I jump? All right. It's the one. It's upstairs. Can I ride up

1752
05:49:32,869 --> 05:50:01,860
the stairs? Come on, you off-road. Let's do it. This is like the 7-Eleven? Which one? Someone buy me.

1753
05:50:01,860 --> 05:50:07,700
Where the fuck is it trying to get me to go? The exit door? Oh, fuck. I didn't even know they were

1754
05:50:07,700 --> 05:50:53,669
up here. Die. Go in here, I guess. So it's in the security room. In fact, I should probably put it

1755
05:50:53,669 --> 05:51:03,599
as cold spray coffee filters developing solution. Oh, like a developing solution, not the solution

1756
05:51:03,599 --> 05:51:15,639
for what you're trying to do is currently developing. Where's this trying to get me to go?

1757
05:51:30,680 --> 05:51:40,040
Coffee filter? It's right here. Coffee filters. Where are the boots? Are they right there?

1758
05:51:40,680 --> 05:52:12,500
Yeah. I lost my clothes. Yeah. They're behind the vent? Where? Go back? Yeah. Yeah. They have to be

1759
05:52:12,500 --> 05:52:29,270
in another safe. Speaking of saving, they have to be in the new game. That's all right. No. No. No.

1760
05:52:30,470 --> 05:52:42,200
No. No. What do you mean no? Do you see boots? I don't. There's lockers back here.

1761
05:52:45,319 --> 05:52:51,159
Yeah. Well, that's all right. I'm glad with this. I'll take my grandma's rug. Yeah. Oh, but what

1762
05:52:51,159 --> 05:53:07,569
about the red one? I got red hair. Yeah. What about the snake? Yeah. Yeah. All right. Good.

1763
05:53:11,110 --> 05:53:28,959
Yeah. No. This is just default. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I had on. And new glasses. Yeah.

1764
05:53:30,319 --> 05:53:41,840
My hair. Fuck. It's all right. I'll just go with the grandma rug. Well, I don't, I don't see them

1765
05:53:41,840 --> 05:53:52,979
anywhere. I do not think they're here. So let's go. I have 24 hours to live. I don't really,

1766
05:53:52,979 --> 05:54:05,349
I don't really care about my hair color right now. Under the table. Lockers behind the stairs.

1767
05:54:06,150 --> 05:54:23,439
I just used these. I just did all this. All right. I'm out of here. I'm leaving. Where are the last

1768
05:54:23,439 --> 05:54:32,950
two? There's one right here somewhere and then there's one down. Cold spray developing solution.

1769
05:54:32,950 --> 05:54:43,319
The camera store is the other one. So let's do cold spray. Reload. Reload. I see what you're doing.

1770
05:54:55,700 --> 05:55:17,729
Wait, is it in here? Oh, this is actually not good. Don't I need queens? Oh shit. I need queens.

1771
05:55:39,990 --> 05:55:56,790
Cold spray in the skateboarding store. Really? That's stupid. Okay. All of a sudden,

1772
05:55:56,790 --> 05:56:23,000
it's like a party in here now. Okay. Any queens? Only one more thing to get. It's below me. It's

1773
05:56:23,000 --> 05:56:52,689
the camera store and it's developing solution. Camera. Hey. No. Next one. Got a ball. All right.

1774
05:56:54,319 --> 05:57:10,200
Let's finish this. Now I got to get back to up here. What's the fastest route? Wonderland up.

1775
05:57:11,189 --> 05:57:48,020
Yeah. Bathroom shortcut. Well, I'm guaranteed at least two queens. At least. Watch out. I don't

1776
05:57:48,020 --> 05:58:18,259
get swarmed here. So now I just bang right and go straight up. On to part two. I hate this new outfit.

1777
05:58:18,259 --> 05:58:25,220
This looks uncomfortable. I know what this feels like. It's gonna be itchy and hairy and spiky at

1778
05:58:25,220 --> 05:58:49,650
the same time. I'm gonna get some more juices. Is this even worth doing? It's not. Straight on.

1779
05:59:00,790 --> 05:59:20,290
Go straight on. I brought the ingredients. Help me. Help me. Help me. Help me.

1780
05:59:26,119 --> 05:59:30,840
I just dump them all. I open up my giant fucking dad smoking jacket and they all fall out.

1781
05:59:47,119 --> 05:59:51,439
When I was working in the medical lab, my brother asked me to research a method of suppressing a

1782
05:59:51,439 --> 05:59:57,220
parasite. Of course, back then we didn't extract the hormones directly. We synthesized them in the

1783
05:59:57,220 --> 06:00:08,200
lab. So he was looking to protect himself from his own terrorist scheme. He wanted a way out. Is

1784
06:00:08,200 --> 06:00:17,860
that it? I don't know. I know he didn't bring the drug with him here. I have no idea what he intended

1785
06:00:17,860 --> 06:00:26,159
to use it for. You think I'm just making excuses, but Carlito kept things from me.

1786
06:00:35,029 --> 06:00:41,830
Even if this is ugly, the whole thing is this. I could handle the jacket if the pants were different.

1787
06:00:42,150 --> 06:00:50,209
It won't completely cure me. It just looks like I got run over by a car. I have like tire tracks all

1788
06:00:50,209 --> 06:00:56,849
over me. I got run over by 15 cars in a row. The parasite will develop as it normally would,

1789
06:00:56,849 --> 06:01:17,439
continuing the zombification process. You look like a bad couch. Yeah, not just a bad couch,

1790
06:01:17,439 --> 06:01:34,880
a couch that's sitting at the end of somebody's driveway that just says free on it. What happens

1791
06:01:34,880 --> 06:01:41,200
to all those free couches that nobody takes? They just go to the same place, huh? Into the landfill?

1792
06:01:49,040 --> 06:01:52,799
Just how long do you suppose your drug will prevent me from turning into a walking corpse?

1793
06:01:53,759 --> 06:01:57,279
During my research, I was never able to conduct proper clinical studies.

1794
06:01:58,400 --> 06:02:03,040
To a certain extent, the period of effectiveness depends on each patient's physiology.

1795
06:02:06,119 --> 06:02:14,610
Maybe only a week. There's no way to tell for sure. They're skinned for suits. Well, that makes some

1796
06:02:14,770 --> 06:02:15,250
sense.

1797
06:02:25,680 --> 06:02:29,200
You had to say they're skinned for sure for suits.

1798
06:02:33,040 --> 06:02:37,200
The material on the couch is not the couch's skin.

1799
06:02:41,250 --> 06:02:43,409
It's a layer on top of the padding.

1800
06:02:43,490 --> 06:02:49,669
To find homes for a large group of children. Want to guess just how many?

1801
06:02:52,790 --> 06:03:12,880
Showed all those names. These are the people I saved. You're saying he infected these kids

1802
06:03:12,880 --> 06:03:20,639
and then gave them your drug? He made 50 little ticking time bombs? I don't know.

1803
06:03:21,279 --> 06:03:24,500
But you have to go find them. They're all scattered around the mall.

1804
06:03:29,759 --> 06:03:34,840
These kids are spread all over the country. Nobody up in Idaho, though.

1805
06:03:35,159 --> 06:03:41,299
Right. The entire country could be crawling with zombies by now. Just head to Idaho.

1806
06:03:41,860 --> 06:03:48,599
Just make your house out of bricks and cement. That we don't know for sure that we can't warn

1807
06:03:48,599 --> 06:03:56,310
anyone about. Oh Wyoming for that matter, yeah. We need to do right now. Prepare the hormone

1808
06:03:56,310 --> 06:04:12,290
and get you taken care of. Okay, so what's next? Oh no, the generator's broken down. I can't work

1809
06:04:12,290 --> 06:04:16,930
without power. Go turn on the generator. There has to be a backup generator somewhere. Carlito was

1810
06:04:16,930 --> 06:04:26,680
using the clock tower for storage. Maybe he left one in there. Check out the clock tower. Oh no,

1811
06:04:26,680 --> 06:04:37,189
the generator. This is a filler episode. You don't go from there are 50 children spread around that

1812
06:04:37,189 --> 06:04:44,130
are all like ticking time bomb diseases to like infect the whole world to go turn the power back

1813
06:04:44,130 --> 06:05:10,319
on. Unless you're stretching it a little. How far away is this? It's not that far. It is overtime.

1814
06:05:10,319 --> 06:05:23,360
Let's just get out there and do it. Every game has this exact level at some point.

1815
06:05:25,169 --> 06:05:34,020
Why is there, what's with the power situation? In every universe there's always like a generator

1816
06:05:34,020 --> 06:05:41,479
you need to turn on. Are we just automatically assuming that just all electricity just goes

1817
06:05:41,479 --> 06:05:58,150
rotten? It's not like raw hamburger meat. It just stays on. You just need somebody in there to like

1818
06:05:58,150 --> 06:06:10,200
keep it turned on and to do maintenance to it. Okay, that's why a face cam's not on because

1819
06:06:10,200 --> 06:06:20,689
fucking boogers just shot out of my nose. It takes like a thousand people to keep a power plant

1820
06:06:20,689 --> 06:06:33,090
running. Actually I'm getting a cold I think. It started developing right when I got back

1821
06:06:33,970 --> 06:06:40,770
from the east coast and it hasn't gone away. It's still here. I haven't got a full-blown cold but

1822
06:06:40,770 --> 06:06:46,360
it's not, it's just halfway. A little bit of a scratchy throat and some stuffiness but that's

1823
06:06:46,360 --> 06:06:54,020
it. Stay away from it. Just come here for a second. Get away. Just don't come near me. Just come here

1824
06:06:54,020 --> 06:07:12,439
for a minute. I'm not infected. I'm not. I'm not. Let's just talk really close. Like shake my hand

1825
06:07:13,159 --> 06:07:29,810
and then shake like 10 other people's hands. Can't get in there. What happened? What did the

1826
06:07:29,810 --> 06:07:41,189
satellite crash? Oh fuck that's a helicopter. Why does the satellite just crash? That's a stage light.

1827
06:07:41,189 --> 06:07:48,520
This is the Truman Show. I know it's bullshit. Okay I've had the generator. It's time to leave.

1828
06:07:49,319 --> 06:08:21,240
So I can just leave now, right? That didn't, that seems very simple. Snacks. Imagine dropping your

1829
06:08:21,240 --> 06:08:34,450
gun to eat potato chips. You don't have to imagine for very much longer. Straight up. Get queens.

1830
06:08:35,090 --> 06:08:58,159
Should I just take a nectar? Take a nectar and just start spraying? Terma not yet. Don't do it.

1831
06:08:58,159 --> 06:09:20,790
Don't do it. All right fine. Wait. Nah that's not worth it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it.

1832
06:09:20,790 --> 06:09:26,450
I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. How fast do you think I can string the syllables

1833
06:09:26,450 --> 06:09:30,720
together? I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going

1834
06:09:30,720 --> 06:09:56,290
to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. That's pretty good. Wrong way idiot. Wrong

1835
06:09:56,290 --> 06:10:01,009
way. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy

1836
06:10:01,009 --> 06:10:10,720
boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. She sells seashells on the seashore. She sells seashells on the seashore.

1837
06:10:10,720 --> 06:10:19,520
She sells seashells on the seashore. She sells seashells on the seashore. She sells seashells

1838
06:10:19,520 --> 06:10:25,279
on the seashore. She sells seashells on the seashore. I tried it. I did it twice. I don't

1839
06:10:25,279 --> 06:10:30,130
know why I just go. What's another one? Give me another one. Give me another one. I know there's

1840
06:10:30,130 --> 06:10:36,900
at least like three or four of these that exist. I've done this already. Yeah but what's but how

1841
06:10:36,900 --> 06:10:39,860
much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood? How much wood could a woodchuck

1842
06:10:39,860 --> 06:10:42,740
chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood? How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could

1843
06:10:42,740 --> 06:10:52,630
chuck wood? I'll take another hard one please. Unique New York. Unique New York. Unique New York.

1844
06:10:52,630 --> 06:11:07,330
Unique New York. Unique New York. Unique New York. Simple. Any others? Red leather. Yellow

1845
06:11:07,330 --> 06:11:11,090
leather. Red leather. Yellow leather. Red leather. Yellow leather. Red leather. Yellow leather. Red

1846
06:11:11,090 --> 06:11:18,389
leather. Yellow leather. Um looking at my watch here it's seems like a way I don't know no hard

1847
06:11:18,389 --> 06:11:40,400
one. Rubber ducky. What was it? Peter Piper. Peter Piper. What is it? I need the whole line.

1848
06:11:40,400 --> 06:11:45,479
Peter I don't know how to. Peter Piper picked a what? Peter Piper picked a pack of pickled

1849
06:11:45,479 --> 06:11:49,299
peppers. Peter Piper picked a pack of pickled peppers. Peter Piper picked a pack of pickled

1850
06:11:49,299 --> 06:11:52,740
peppers. Peter Piper picked a pack of pickled peppers. Peter Piper picked a pack of pickled

1851
06:11:52,740 --> 06:11:57,939
Peter Parker picked a pack of pickled peppers. I had it. I tried throwing a Parker there. Peter

1852
06:11:57,939 --> 06:12:02,419
Parker. What is it? Peter Piper. Peter Piper picked a pack of pickled peppers. Peter Piper

1853
06:12:02,419 --> 06:12:10,529
picked a pack of pickled peppers. Peter Parker picked a pack of pickled peppers. I'm wasting time.

1854
06:12:10,529 --> 06:12:20,520
Thank god you found a spare. Now I'll get back to work. Let me get back to work. If all goes

1855
06:12:20,520 --> 06:12:25,360
plan I should have just about all the equipment I need now. Bring me some adult queens and I can

1856
06:12:25,360 --> 06:12:53,430
get started. All right. Wristwatch. Hold on let me save this. I'm not saying that. I'll say that

1857
06:12:53,430 --> 06:13:01,840
really fast. Oh yeah let me go for it. Now I'm afraid that saying that wristwatch one and me

1858
06:13:01,840 --> 06:13:16,099
saying it three or four times in a row is gonna be something fucking horrible coming out of my mouth.

1859
06:13:16,099 --> 06:13:38,209
All right here's a queen. One queen. I need at least 10. Are you serious? Where am I gonna get

1860
06:13:38,209 --> 06:13:47,650
10 queens? I have to go out to the park, drink nectar, and then mow everybody down. How many

1861
06:13:47,650 --> 06:13:54,400
slots do I have? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. I have 10 slots. That's enough

1862
06:13:54,400 --> 06:14:10,549
to hold one weapon. Just run zombies over in the tunnel. That's not a bad play. I'm gonna go this

1863
06:14:10,549 --> 06:14:30,479
way. Nectar smoothies. Nectar smoothies. Nectar smoothies. Nectar smoothies. Smoothies. Nectar

1864
06:14:30,479 --> 06:14:50,099
smoothie. Nectar smoothie. Nectar smoothie. Nectar smoothie. Give me another one. Get off me.

1865
06:14:57,299 --> 06:15:07,110
Why did I just pick this up? Why would you ever give this to me? 18 hours remain until you die.

1866
06:15:09,590 --> 06:15:14,310
Nectar is just orange juice right? Fuzzy wuzzy was a bear. Fuzzy wuzzy had no hair. Fuzzy wuzzy

1867
06:15:14,310 --> 06:15:18,630
wasn't very fuzzy. Now wuzzy. Fuzzy wuzzy was a bear. Fuzzy wuzzy had no hair. Fuzzy wuzzy wasn't

1868
06:15:18,630 --> 06:15:44,630
very fuzzy. Wuzzy. Nectar at the uh grocery store. I need to pay attention to the video game. Hold on.

1869
06:15:45,569 --> 06:15:53,439
Going into this place I'm gonna get a bunch of orange juice. Orange juice is you can combine

1870
06:15:53,439 --> 06:16:00,500
it with anything that makes nectar. Right? Wrong. What? What are you talking about? What do you mean?

1871
06:16:01,459 --> 06:16:12,450
Oh fuck. Don't make a joke. Spit fire. I'm not spitting fire. Fire's not coming out of my mouth.

1872
06:16:27,680 --> 06:17:15,939
Aim with your fists. This is dumb. I'd rather have a machine gun. Yeah yeah yeah. Give it all.

1873
06:17:16,740 --> 06:17:39,490
Stupid. O.J. only. O.J. only. O.J. only. O.J. only. Yeah he really isn't. He's vibrating.

1874
06:17:45,430 --> 06:18:33,159
Attack. Attack. Attack. Okay orange juice. Orange juice. Not milk. Disgusting. Orange juice. Okay

1875
06:18:33,159 --> 06:18:41,250
I'm giving up one of the chainsaws. No I'm not. Those are very necessary I think. That's five

1876
06:18:41,729 --> 06:19:08,069
nectarines. That should do it. If it can't then I don't know what to tell you. To the cafe which

1877
06:19:08,069 --> 06:19:21,360
will go down into wonderland. Take the teleporter. Cafe. What do you mean? What am I doing? Why do we

1878
06:19:21,360 --> 06:19:42,770
go here? To get this orange juice. Which is at the cafe. Wait blender. Blender in the market?

1879
06:19:43,409 --> 06:19:47,520
There's a blender in the grocery store. A blender in the grocery store.

1880
06:19:48,479 --> 06:20:02,119
Well why didn't you say so? Why didn't you say so? This is a lie. Is this a is this a is this a lie?

1881
06:20:03,319 --> 06:20:13,169
It's a fucking lie. Of course it is. It is. We made it out. Yeah of course we did.

1882
06:20:13,970 --> 06:20:32,119
I can't believe I just took one like 10 percent of FHP. I'm I don't even need it anymore. The

1883
06:20:32,119 --> 06:21:02,069
battery's over here. The bathroom's over here. I just violently coyote that guy. He's gonna run

1884
06:21:02,069 --> 06:22:17,139
into Hogwarts. Maybe. Where are these? So now we go down up. Cafe. I'm gonna sneeze again. I don't

1885
06:22:17,139 --> 06:22:24,240
know if my allergies. I don't even have allergies. I made that up. I don't have allergies. Oh my

1886
06:22:24,240 --> 06:22:34,819
allergies. I did your toys as well. All right. Pie orange juice.

1887
06:22:50,069 --> 06:23:14,080
What? That's what he does. Listen. Why is everybody getting so disgusted when I do

1888
06:23:14,080 --> 06:23:20,720
it but he's been doing this the whole game? And that's you're not disgusted by that one.

1889
06:23:20,720 --> 06:23:30,599
What do you mean that's me? No it's not. I'll prove it. Ready?

1890
06:23:30,759 --> 06:24:29,330
See? See? Why would I mute though? See? Who even cares about this? Nobody. There's so many.

1891
06:24:29,330 --> 06:25:02,500
What happened to my gun? I can do one more. Okay. I'm gonna drink this one just to be able to run.

1892
06:25:02,500 --> 06:25:11,240
So let's drink this and then where am I running to? I am running to the inside the park over to the

1893
06:25:11,240 --> 06:25:27,889
garage. What are you guys doing over here? German WWE. I've seen this already. I've seen it. Just

1894
06:25:27,889 --> 06:25:58,950
get queens now. Get queens now. I only see one queen. I have to wait for the nectar to end.

1895
06:25:59,590 --> 06:26:07,939
Can I just start killing people with the nectar activator? And does that increase the spawn rate

1896
06:26:07,939 --> 06:26:21,479
or am I just making this up? That's not real. No it just spawns. Okay so I need eight more.

1897
06:26:22,770 --> 06:26:51,919
One, two, three, one, two, three, four, five, six. Okay I need two more. One, two, three, four, five,

1898
06:26:51,919 --> 06:27:10,150
one, two, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. I need to lose the chainsaw unfortunately.

1899
06:27:10,709 --> 06:27:36,040
Just kill zombies with it while waiting. Not a bad idea. Why do I hear something? I can't believe

1900
06:27:36,040 --> 06:28:10,849
you need ten of these. I hear a queen. Okay. Now queen. No? Come on spawn another one. Marathon

1901
06:28:10,849 --> 06:28:35,669
runner achieved. What I run like 20 miles or something. Use my new skill. Oh no. No queen.

1902
06:28:39,619 --> 06:29:21,860
The wall kick. Still no queen. This nectar sucks. Idiot spring. Boy. There we go. I have three. I

1903
06:29:21,860 --> 06:30:15,840
need six more. So here's the plan. No I can't. They're all dead out here. Never mind. Zombies

1904
06:30:15,840 --> 06:30:25,110
that have the hands above their heads spawn the queen. God damn it game. Why?

1905
06:30:35,349 --> 06:30:55,159
When shit breaks don't you think you should have like a fucking second. This other chainsaw is

1906
06:30:55,159 --> 06:31:25,750
gonna break too. I can always get another one. Give me a queen. Just go farm with the car. Yeah

1907
06:31:25,750 --> 06:32:00,740
fuck this. I'm going to the car. Give me the queen. All right do not break these. Do not. I

1908
06:32:00,740 --> 06:32:16,259
hear another one. I still hear one. All right I'm close. I'm getting close. All right maybe I don't

1909
06:32:16,259 --> 06:32:52,610
need to do that. Just keep killing stuff. Is that guy's hands above his head? That's a queen guy

1910
06:32:52,610 --> 06:33:39,299
right? I hear queen. There we go. Let's go. Lucky. I need another gun. I don't have ten. One two three

1911
06:33:39,299 --> 06:33:58,130
four five six. I need four more. Ten. What are you talking about? You already gave one. Yeah so that's

1912
06:33:58,130 --> 06:34:55,909
one two three four five six. She said I need to give ten more. You dare Jeremy. Don't do it.

1913
06:34:55,909 --> 06:35:19,939
I gotta find some more military. No. I gotta kill somebody. Oh somebody with their hands in the

1914
06:35:19,939 --> 06:36:02,840
air. All I have is a knife. Hands in the air. Of course the guy shows up right now. I got it all

1915
06:36:02,840 --> 06:36:11,590
right. I need one more. One. One two three four five six seven eight nine. I need one more. Let's

1916
06:36:11,590 --> 06:36:30,439
get it on the way back. Yeah I need a weapon though. All right teleport. Teleport save.

1917
06:36:32,180 --> 06:36:57,880
Like a guitar or something. Hands in the air. Got one. Bye. Although I don't have any. I have

1918
06:36:57,880 --> 06:37:07,840
no weapons. Nice job. You fucking. Maybe they'll sing songs about you. Just fuck it and run.

1919
06:37:08,479 --> 06:37:32,069
I do have one drink left. All right. Just have to turn right and go straight up. Hopefully I don't

1920
06:37:32,069 --> 06:38:03,569
get shot by anybody. Get the motorcycle and we got all the queens we need. In fact I'm gonna drink

1921
06:38:03,569 --> 06:38:10,979
this. Wait. Wait. Where is it? Wait. Wait. Wait. Okay. No get on the bike. Get on the bike. Get on

1922
06:38:10,979 --> 06:38:59,619
the bike. Fuck it. I was gonna get a katana. Turn it in. Here you go. Bring me more queens. More.

1923
06:39:00,180 --> 06:39:35,479
Can I just put them all in the same jar? I'll take another five queens please. Keep it up. I should

1924
06:39:35,479 --> 06:40:01,439
be able to make whatever it is we're making. Two more. Three more. Do I have three more?

1925
06:40:01,439 --> 06:40:24,709
One last specimen. This is it. You're gonna inject me with that huh? Okay doc. Let's get this over

1926
06:40:24,709 --> 06:40:51,669
with. At least I won't have to worry about turning into one of them for a while. That just accelerated

1927
06:40:51,669 --> 06:41:06,479
it. Okay. Next on the agenda. Figure out a way to get the hell out of here. While I was isolating the

1928
06:41:06,479 --> 06:41:11,750
hormone I managed to identify. I really hope I don't have to go get like 10 frozen pieces or

1929
06:41:11,750 --> 06:41:22,740
something. In other words the zombies don't like the way it smells. If you give me a little more

1930
06:41:22,740 --> 06:41:31,810
time I should be able to produce some of this pheromone. They think it smells bad? I'm gonna

1931
06:41:31,810 --> 06:41:39,669
smear ourselves with the anti-zombie juice. To keep them away from us? You can just walk right past

1932
06:41:39,750 --> 06:41:43,509
more queens. 20 this time. That would be horrible.

1933
06:42:12,479 --> 06:42:16,869
It's a nice blender. It is.

1934
06:42:19,590 --> 06:42:29,479
Experiments will only have enough to use at once. Or 100 times. As long as I save before it happens.

1935
06:42:37,860 --> 06:42:52,049
I did not save before it happened. Good. Considering how many of them keep pouring out of here

1936
06:42:52,049 --> 06:42:59,270
it must be connected to something. Just throw the bike in the tunnel and just flirt. Any other way

1937
06:42:59,270 --> 06:43:05,759
out of here is guarded by the military. If we're gonna get out of here and put a stop to Carlito's

1938
06:43:05,759 --> 06:43:11,520
plan we've got to go in there. What was the last time you saved? I'm doing a thing where I

1939
06:43:11,520 --> 06:43:22,419
get three save points. I used my last one yesterday at some point. I'm doing like a kind of a hardcore

1940
06:43:22,419 --> 06:43:48,900
thing like hardcore night. I think I got it though. I'm going through the same five chat

1941
06:43:48,900 --> 06:43:56,529
jokes Jeremy. I'm getting tired. Why do you have to just go through the same jokes?

1942
06:43:58,659 --> 06:44:17,939
Whoa. Save game. Did I do it? Are we covered in this? She just holds this magic scroll.

1943
06:44:17,939 --> 06:44:28,630
I don't have any weapons. I have like a leader of orange juice. Okay I gotta rock. I gotta

1944
06:44:28,630 --> 06:44:46,040
pick up like all the rocks I can. But where do we go from here? Just run? Is she gonna open the door?

1945
06:44:46,759 --> 06:45:20,119
Where do I go? Where do I go? Use rock. That looks like I could go in here. Can we open this up? Okay

1946
06:45:20,119 --> 06:45:45,110
we can open this together. Are you? Oh she's gonna use her like immolation aura. No I want a German

1947
06:45:45,110 --> 06:46:14,240
soup like somebody. Rock good. Rock all I have. Used all inventory slots on orange juice. Speaking

1948
06:46:14,240 --> 06:46:38,080
of orange juice I'm gonna need to use it. A queen's gonna spawn. Where's the queen that spawns? We're

1949
06:46:38,080 --> 06:47:05,000
drinking a nectar. Why did it? Why am I jumping back here? Hold her hand? I just tried to.

1950
06:47:08,159 --> 06:47:25,479
Come here. Give me a queen. We keep getting separated. Dude this game with the hand holding.

1951
06:47:25,479 --> 06:47:33,409
You held hands and if you touch anything you just. Oh my god I hate this. Get off of me.

1952
06:47:33,970 --> 06:47:44,389
What are you doing? I'm holding her hand and then you. Oh sorry. You held hands but then you.

1953
06:47:46,389 --> 06:48:03,299
I'm just gonna run. Hey come here let's hold hands. Hey what do you say we go this way? I have to go

1954
06:48:03,299 --> 06:48:08,819
all the way around you to make you go this direction. Let's go. Oh sorry I don't hold

1955
06:48:08,819 --> 06:48:46,180
hand anymore. Let's go. Follow me. Give me a rock. At least I got my nectar. Come here. Come.

1956
06:48:59,759 --> 06:49:21,270
Knife. Oh it's a pickaxe. Now I don't know why magic is she won't let go.

1957
06:49:21,830 --> 06:49:54,630
No there it is. That's right when I say it. Come on. Walk forward. This was the worst vacation ever.

1958
06:49:55,270 --> 06:50:08,520
Isn't that what I was doing here? What was I actually doing here? It's okay honey these are

1959
06:50:08,520 --> 06:50:14,880
all actors. Really crazy. This is zombie apocalypse. Yeah they can't touch you.

1960
06:50:14,880 --> 06:50:30,470
Don't worry if they touch you you can sue them. I'm fucking suing that guy. Are we going here?

1961
06:50:33,810 --> 06:50:50,630
Oh shit. Oh honey. I'm gonna have to get all my lorries as well. They're fighting back.

1962
06:50:56,099 --> 06:50:59,060
Don't worry honey. I learned this in zangief school.

1963
06:51:03,810 --> 06:51:21,619
Get over here please. It's a queen. Give me the queen. Okay okay. What a tough what a stupid

1964
06:51:21,619 --> 06:51:44,360
bait that tunnel is. Wait there's more of this shit? This game is fucked. Stay with me. Why would

1965
06:51:44,360 --> 06:52:14,080
you let go of me? No you're making this so hard on me. Please come here. I thought I just picked her up.

1966
06:52:18,389 --> 06:52:36,720
Queen. No not on top of me. I can't even grab her hand. Press the button.

1967
06:52:37,360 --> 06:53:01,000
Stop letting go of me. Why are you letting me? Mr. Queen. It's too late. Does this stuff even

1968
06:53:01,000 --> 06:53:08,689
work anymore? This stuff doesn't even work. It doesn't even fucking work anymore. I'm gonna die

1969
06:53:08,689 --> 06:54:03,540
here. Did you let go? Hey did you let go? Hey did you let go? All right did you let go again?

1970
06:54:17,349 --> 06:54:24,389
I didn't mean to get the ass shot. That's all I can do right now. I just want to hold your hand.

1971
06:54:24,389 --> 06:54:37,799
Just please let me get through this ending segment. Walk slowly. I am. I promise. I promise I'm

1972
06:54:37,799 --> 06:54:42,479
walking slowly. That's actually a pretty good opportunity for a photo. There's like a million

1973
06:54:42,479 --> 06:55:11,119
faces. Yes I am. Yes I am. Yes I am. Yes I am. Oh is that the problem? Trying to figure out what

1974
06:55:11,119 --> 06:55:38,159
the issue was. Kill them. Kill them with your scent. You watched it happen. Imagine the smell.

1975
06:55:41,380 --> 06:55:54,659
For them I guess they really don't like this. Like a little bit of enthusiasm would be nice.

1976
06:55:54,659 --> 06:56:01,680
It's like you don't want to be here. Like you're the one. What did I do wrong there?

1977
06:56:02,400 --> 06:56:16,229
I did wrong. She ran the fuck away from me. She fucking ruined it. She just bolted from me

1978
06:56:16,790 --> 06:56:31,200
and now we're getting overwhelmed. She's using me as a shield. This is not okay.

1979
06:56:31,680 --> 06:57:00,180
Come here. We can't even fucking walk. All right it's time for a zangief. Let's go. Let's go.

1980
06:57:01,139 --> 06:57:33,540
Okay good good good good good. Give me a rock. Come here. Right side. All right this is. You got

1981
06:57:33,540 --> 06:57:50,930
stuck here last time. You idiot. We somehow went higher up on the rock. How do we get all the way

1982
06:57:50,930 --> 06:57:59,520
back up to the top of the rock? No I don't want to go. Stop. No don't. Leave me alone. Help me.

1983
06:58:00,479 --> 06:58:24,209
Please. Don't just hit me. No stop going backwards and they all just get on top of you.

1984
06:58:31,240 --> 06:59:00,529
Isabella you're going backwards. Are you drinking out of that thing? You're using it as like an

1985
06:59:00,529 --> 06:59:22,049
inhaler. All right I made it. Queen give me the fucking thing. Is this thing out of juice?

1986
06:59:23,220 --> 06:59:32,310
I've yet to understand what's going on right now. This is unbelievable. This is unfucking

1987
06:59:32,310 --> 06:59:56,080
unbelievable. Just run ahead of her? I tried to do that last time. It's over. I have to go get like

1988
06:59:56,080 --> 07:00:16,790
guns. I can't just leave. Just save the goddamn game. Use the meat. Yeah easiest have been done.

1989
07:00:17,509 --> 07:00:25,220
Why can't we just drop a bomb in here? Instead of making something to make me like live another

1990
07:00:25,220 --> 07:00:34,389
three days, you should have made a bomb. You should have made like a bunch of fucking grenades.

1991
07:00:35,110 --> 07:01:14,080
I'm doing it this time. Don't let go of my fucking hand.

1992
07:01:49,840 --> 07:01:56,959
Wow real hard huh? It took me fucking five tries. How dare you say that and have that happen? How

1993
07:01:56,959 --> 07:02:00,799
dare you say that and have what you just saw happen? How dare you say that when there's this

1994
07:02:00,799 --> 07:02:26,080
rock here? How dare you say that when this rock exists? How dare you? Somebody just told me to

1995
07:02:26,080 --> 07:02:32,400
stop going through the zombies and that's what's working. It's just running is in them right into

1996
07:02:32,400 --> 07:02:45,720
them. Oh my god. Let it be over please. What did I just do? I just like Captain Falcon'd over here.

1997
07:02:45,720 --> 07:03:29,759
What was that? All right I'll take it. Oh why did you fall? Oh I don't have any weapons.

1998
07:03:33,990 --> 07:03:46,740
Hands on your hips really? Don't give me that shit. Hold on let me just stop and push someone.

1999
07:03:47,759 --> 07:04:02,979
Is someone going to make that my fault? Unbelievable. Now do it again.

2000
07:04:04,130 --> 07:04:14,180
Yeah we have to do it again. I don't have any weapons. I had a whole beehive with me.

2001
07:04:32,310 --> 07:04:37,669
I hope so. No don't just do it in the cut scene. Don't make me do this.

2002
07:04:38,549 --> 07:05:03,840
All right. Don't make me do this shit. I'm gonna go back here. Did you fall off? Um exactly what

2003
07:05:03,840 --> 07:05:22,069
we're doing. Why? Why are we holding hands? I could have just picked you up and been the set.

2004
07:05:22,069 --> 07:05:47,080
Why would we need to hold hands for this part? I can't believe it. I want to remember this moment.

2005
07:05:47,799 --> 07:06:20,720
Why couldn't I just put her in? Can I be the gunner? Can you just drive?

2006
07:06:21,919 --> 07:06:57,169
This doesn't seem fair. I'm gonna keyboard keyboard mouse for this one. Does this thing

2007
07:06:57,169 --> 07:07:36,389
overheat? I'm just shooting at the blinking lights. Holy shit this is gonna take forever.

2008
07:07:42,209 --> 07:08:53,779
My hand is getting tired. This is stupid. This is so long. Don't lose it now. I'm going fine.

2009
07:08:54,580 --> 07:09:57,509
Is that the end of the damn game? These automated machines are no use at all on the battlefield.

2010
07:09:57,509 --> 07:10:02,950
Switch to manual control. Phase two. That means if I lose this I have to do that all again.

2011
07:10:15,880 --> 07:10:24,080
What now? What? Oh this is gonna come back and just rain fire down on me.

2012
07:10:31,750 --> 07:10:46,689
Aim main cannon. So what have we here? I gotta get at least a decent photo before I die. Where

2013
07:10:46,689 --> 07:10:59,189
are we hiding when my men mopped up the mall? On a mission in which the number of targets is

2014
07:10:59,189 --> 07:11:10,310
unclear. It's difficult to ensure absolute thoroughness. You have imagination. That's

2015
07:11:10,310 --> 07:11:21,119
what drives you in your quest to run, quest to hide. His cigar is not lit. As prey you and

2016
07:11:22,389 --> 07:11:29,439
much more stubborn than the zombies. That's not. How much do you know about the

2017
07:11:29,439 --> 07:11:34,799
zombies? It's like a cinnamon stick. I commanded the Santa Cabeza cleanup operation.

2018
07:11:37,639 --> 07:11:43,479
If we had fulfilled our mission then we wouldn't be needed here now to take care of this.

2019
07:11:44,599 --> 07:11:49,000
All right I don't have any weapons so can I like beat them with charisma? That's all it was to you

2020
07:11:49,000 --> 07:11:53,639
huh? Do I have any dialogue options? What about those innocent people who had to pay for sins

2021
07:11:53,639 --> 07:12:01,159
committed by our government? Our mistakes have not begun with this operation. I think I actually

2022
07:12:01,159 --> 07:12:10,959
have a piece of meat, a rock, and a knife. Can I beat this guy with a rock? It's self to be quite

2023
07:12:10,959 --> 07:12:24,720
adept at making mistakes. Hell it's the only thing we truly excel at. Well then I'd say this mission

2024
07:12:24,720 --> 07:12:58,040
isn't quite over yet. Don't you agree? Is the tank alive? Does it have thoughts? We're not gonna have

2025
07:12:58,119 --> 07:13:13,639
a shitty version of on top of the Metal Gear Solid fight right? That was embarrassing!

2026
07:13:16,389 --> 07:14:13,189
Suplex! What if I go down? It's such a good one. No! I thought I was the cutscene. All right how do I do

2027
07:14:13,189 --> 07:14:29,909
moves? Oh wait he's fighting. Will he come down here? Wait a minute. I'm gonna pick up a zombie

2028
07:14:29,909 --> 07:15:02,900
and throw it at him. Isabella. Isabella can you fight hand to hand? That's a good photo. Can I like

2029
07:15:06,020 --> 07:15:13,439
what's the game plan? Just just do the the stomp. Jump stomp jump stomp over and over again.

2030
07:15:26,479 --> 07:15:41,040
Yeah just I'm gonna knee drop over and over. Here we go. I can't do a suplex. All right I'm ready.

2031
07:15:45,810 --> 07:15:58,580
That doesn't work guys. He blocks it. Shit. Why don't I have a block? The spin move?

2032
07:16:00,080 --> 07:16:09,090
Okay practicing. He's gonna block it. He's gonna block it. He's gonna block it. It's gonna be bad.

2033
07:16:09,090 --> 07:16:11,970
And I'm giving myself. This is making this really hard for me.

2034
07:16:13,119 --> 07:16:24,310
Just block home. Okay I'm gonna Spinning Lariat. Middle school fight tactics. Get away from me you

2035
07:16:24,310 --> 07:16:41,939
bully! Let's go. No don't bite me. It didn't. Get rid of the zombies. Get rid of the zombies.

2036
07:16:43,909 --> 07:16:54,119
Kill him. Kill him. Bite him. Somebody bite him. No not me. Oh this sucks. He's stuck. Wait a minute.

2037
07:16:54,119 --> 07:17:00,319
Okay easy. Slow down. Take it. Take a second here. I just have to get back on the fucking thing.

2038
07:17:01,540 --> 07:17:50,389
Like this. Like that. Okay. Spit on him. This is not gonna work. This doesn't hurt anybody.

2039
07:17:51,919 --> 07:18:22,439
Does this hurt? No. I think he's getting hurt by the zombies.

2040
07:18:26,000 --> 07:18:27,759
Kill him. His health is going down.

2041
07:18:32,770 --> 07:19:06,150
This is. I gotta get a photo. That's right. Farm photos. Oh man that's a lot of photo money.

2042
07:19:17,479 --> 07:19:18,439
This is so much.

2043
07:19:18,439 --> 07:19:54,799
This is thousands of XP. How much health does he have? I'm level 35.

2044
07:19:55,520 --> 07:20:00,720
Get Isabella in the picture too. That's not. Okay good. Let's try that.

2045
07:20:01,360 --> 07:20:42,080
She has to be facing the right way. Got it. Can I reach over there? That one's a pretty good one

2046
07:20:42,080 --> 07:21:54,099
too. Okay right here. Don't move it. Shit. Kill him. Is there a taunt? How do I taunt? I might

2047
07:21:54,099 --> 07:22:26,840
have to get the last hit on him. Otherwise maybe he'll just die. I don't even know what to say

2048
07:22:26,840 --> 07:22:35,860
anymore. I've spit out all the fluid in my body. Yeah that's right. All right. Fighting. Fighting

2049
07:22:35,860 --> 07:22:46,020
him. I have one HP left. I think I'm gonna be close. Almost got it. Almost got it. Fuck this

2050
07:22:46,020 --> 07:23:15,319
is intense. Come on. One more hit. Uh oh. I have to finish him with a spit. I have to jump and

2051
07:23:16,759 --> 07:23:30,520
land on top of him with the stomp. Get out of here. He can't even believe it. He can't believe it.

2052
07:23:30,520 --> 07:24:06,790
That was ridiculous. Now he epically falls back into the zombies. He did that four or five hundred

2053
07:24:06,790 --> 07:24:37,560
times. The last one. That's all I got. I'm going all the way back. Epically. That could have been

2054
07:24:37,560 --> 07:25:27,169
really bad. Wait hold on. This is not like a part two part two. That's bad ending? There's a

2055
07:25:27,169 --> 07:25:34,069
comic that explains what happens afterward. That's the real ending. No that's the overtime ending.

2056
07:25:34,069 --> 07:25:54,549
That's the true ending. Has to be right? Does saving Brad actually do it? Thank you file actor

2057
07:25:54,549 --> 07:26:02,319
Lich for the hundred dollars. Ten thousand bits. I missed it. It was fifty thousand. Five thousand

2058
07:26:02,319 --> 07:26:06,639
twice. This is the funniest thing I've seen in weeks. Jerma getting rejected. She doesn't

2059
07:26:06,639 --> 07:26:16,720
want to hold your hand dude. No we're supposed to be protecting each other. And then is this

2060
07:26:16,720 --> 07:26:44,200
what Japan thinks what white people are? No it's Frank West. They keep bringing Frank back.

2061
07:26:45,000 --> 07:27:06,150
Well good he's the original. Are they dancing? This is what Canada thinks America is. Well

2062
07:27:06,150 --> 07:27:14,209
that was a trip. If that's truly the end. That that was a wild one. I'm surprised I've never

2063
07:27:14,209 --> 07:27:35,380
done that before. Let's do Dead Rising 2. But is there another episode? No I'll let you see.

2064
07:27:35,380 --> 07:27:58,069
It might be a small little cutscene at the end right? It might be. That was fun. Some of it

2065
07:27:58,069 --> 07:28:14,659
for me that was a little all over the place. But pretty damn fun and ridiculous. I look forward

2066
07:28:14,659 --> 07:28:28,580
to seeing Dead Rising 2. Play Dead Rising 2 off the record if you want to continue with Frank.

2067
07:28:29,459 --> 07:28:41,720
Is that a DLC campaign or is that a main story thing? DLC? So should I do

2068
07:28:42,680 --> 07:28:49,700
Frank West's campaign first? Infinite Mode has been added to the title screen.

2069
07:28:52,680 --> 07:28:56,599
Do don't do off the record first. Frank West managed to escape the town of Willamette with

2070
07:28:56,599 --> 07:29:01,400
information pertinent to the incident under his belt. The news caused a fervor throughout the

2071
07:29:01,400 --> 07:29:06,040
world leading the US government to admit at least partial culpability in the livestock research

2072
07:29:06,040 --> 07:29:10,790
program. However no connection to the Willamette incident was acknowledged and the events that

2073
07:29:10,790 --> 07:29:19,060
occurred there were deemed to work of a fringe terrorist group. The people of world as could be

2074
07:29:19,060 --> 07:29:24,259
expected from the modern culture of new- what was that? Soon let the Willamette incident fade from

2075
07:29:24,259 --> 07:29:30,279
their minds. The authenticity of Carlito's chilling plan to be utilized the orphans

2076
07:29:30,279 --> 07:29:39,540
as his pawns has yet to be fulfilled and yet he complained that his belly was not full.

2077
07:29:40,340 --> 07:30:16,630
Right at number one. Nice. Very cool. That's it. I defeated the evil. That's gonna be the end of the

2078
07:30:16,630 --> 07:30:24,610
stream. Pretty good place to stop. It's been over seven and a half hours now so I think it's a good

2079
07:30:24,610 --> 07:30:33,060
place to call it. The next time you guys see me will be on Sunday for- wait for it- Community

2080
07:30:33,060 --> 07:30:48,279
Content Night. Hope you had fun. I did. And I'll see you guys on Sunday. Let's transition out of

2081
07:30:48,279 --> 07:30:59,889
here. See you soon. Have a good start to your weekend. Move that out of the way and we can

2082
07:30:59,889 --> 07:31:22,200
move to here. Good night guys. And for those of you staying. Hey look. Hey it's the same people

2083
07:31:22,200 --> 07:31:30,720
every time. It's never changed. What- oh that's- that's the person's tattoo. That's still saved

2084
07:31:30,720 --> 07:31:43,060
here. Anyways let's do the bits. Let's go back to earlier- where were we? Where were we? Where were

2085
07:31:43,060 --> 07:31:50,520
we? Seven hours ago. MVM Matt thanks for the 500 bits. Party party party. You have been sleeping

2086
07:31:50,520 --> 07:31:59,959
and then you wake up every night. It's pretty interesting. Jerma aka Bath Bomb Boy. Thanks for

2087
07:31:59,959 --> 07:32:22,049
the 500 bits. Appreciate it. Much love to you. Thank you the 500 bits. Means a lot. I love the

2088
07:32:22,049 --> 07:32:35,240
Bath Bomb Boy. And it's separated by spaces too. That's the best part. It's like James underscore

2089
07:32:35,240 --> 07:32:46,869
aka underscore Bath Bomb Boy. That thought goes into every single word. But thank you so much.

2090
07:32:46,869 --> 07:32:58,959
I appreciate it. Much love to you. Thank you. Then we had Stinky Beaver for the 250 bits. Dude this

2091
07:32:58,959 --> 07:33:10,599
streamer is fucked. Thank you. Appreciate the 250. Bombination zero thanks to the 300 bits. I left

2092
07:33:10,599 --> 07:33:24,799
my cookie and my milk and I'm about to drink it. This sucks. Why did you lie? It's good. Wait let

2093
07:33:24,799 --> 07:33:30,680
me completely rebuttal that right now. Do you drink the milk after you eat the cereal? Yes or

2094
07:33:30,680 --> 07:33:38,919
no? Because that's what eating the cookie at the end- of course you do. Yes. So if you drop a cookie

2095
07:33:38,919 --> 07:33:42,200
and you drink all the milk and the cookie stays in there for like five ten straight minutes,

2096
07:33:42,200 --> 07:33:52,080
that cookie turns- that's just the same thing as you drinking the milk. I don't want to hear it.

2097
07:33:52,080 --> 07:34:02,799
I don't want to hear it. How dare you? The cookie dissolves and becomes mush. Yeah but a lot of the

2098
07:34:02,799 --> 07:34:11,430
cereal coating dissolves and turns into weird gross sugary nonsense in your milk. I like it.

2099
07:34:11,430 --> 07:34:22,520
You don't have to like it. Yeah what you can just throw it into the trash? No you scoop it out and

2100
07:34:22,520 --> 07:34:32,549
you freeze it and you make a popsicle out of it like a little cookie pop. Up your game. Gnarly

2101
07:34:32,549 --> 07:34:36,790
thanks to the 250. I wonder how you feel when you look over a chat and just see a wall of purple

2102
07:34:36,790 --> 07:34:41,830
links. Are you saying oh nice a funny picture of my face or are you like god damn it not this shit

2103
07:34:41,830 --> 07:34:54,369
again? For the most part I think it's funny. I mean it usually is. That doesn't bother me or anything.

2104
07:34:58,979 --> 07:35:03,139
Sometimes I click on a link and it's just like a simple edit with my face green or something

2105
07:35:04,900 --> 07:35:09,060
and then other times it's like an insanely elaborate photoshop. Yeah like the one with

2106
07:35:09,060 --> 07:35:18,290
my nerd neck. All right well that's all right. We had five communities have some Jeff. I caught it.

2107
07:35:18,290 --> 07:35:25,080
Just want to say it again. Thank you. Here comes the third. Okay we need to talk about something

2108
07:35:25,080 --> 07:35:36,209
after this. Okay that is sneeze number four or three or four for this stream. I never sneeze on

2109
07:35:36,209 --> 07:35:48,680
stream. Why is this happening now? Maybe once in eight hours. It's been four or five times today.

2110
07:35:48,680 --> 07:35:57,560
Don't ask me why. Hey alum thanks for the thousand bits alum. Jeremy it's my 18th birthday tomorrow.

2111
07:35:57,560 --> 07:36:01,799
Glad I could catch a stream. Thanks for being awesome all these years. Happy 18th birthday.

2112
07:36:01,799 --> 07:36:30,159
You can now rent a car. No that's 25. Happy 18th birthday. 24 24 24 whatever. You can rent cars

2113
07:36:30,159 --> 07:36:40,549
under 25. No you can't. 25. The minimum age requirement when renting a car in the United

2114
07:36:40,549 --> 07:36:56,159
States is 25 years old. That's correct. Yeah that's for real. You didn't know that. But uh

2115
07:36:56,159 --> 07:37:05,700
happy birthday seriously. Thanks for the thousand bits. Hope you have a good one tomorrow or it

2116
07:37:05,700 --> 07:37:14,229
might be tomorrow already. So happy birthday now. A phylacteryl itch gave 5,000 bits and I think I

2117
07:37:14,229 --> 07:37:23,700
missed it somehow on top of the other ones at I believe 150 dollars in bits tonight which is insane.

2118
07:37:24,310 --> 07:37:32,759
They say a squirrel on cocaine wouldn't be as twitchy as you are right now. I just I get

2119
07:37:32,759 --> 07:37:39,250
panicky in games like this especially with save points and ways to sincerely screw stuff up.

2120
07:37:39,250 --> 07:37:50,680
But thank you. Thank you phylacteryl itch. Hyperactive. That's more so just hyper reactionary.

2121
07:37:50,680 --> 07:38:08,880
Let me write that word out. That's incorrect. I just needed to see it first. Hyper reactionary.

2122
07:38:08,880 --> 07:38:12,720
Thank you sadvegan for the 250. Glad you enjoyed this game. You missed a lot of special bosses with

2123
07:38:12,720 --> 07:38:17,279
the psychos which are really cool and warrant maybe a second playthrough. But honestly go for

2124
07:38:17,279 --> 07:38:22,720
the second one. The second one is really good. It doesn't have our boy Frank but it's much better.

2125
07:38:22,720 --> 07:38:29,400
Definitely recommend playing that now that you kind of know what you're doing. Yeah it seems like to

2126
07:38:29,959 --> 07:38:37,680
actually play Dead Rising through. You need to do it three or four times and just go save other

2127
07:38:37,680 --> 07:38:46,000
people and then maybe you can get the timing down where you can do everything. But I don't know if

2128
07:38:46,000 --> 07:38:59,110
I'd ever be able to do that. I don't think I would be. Oops don't knock that over. Yeah I'll

2129
07:38:59,110 --> 07:39:04,740
definitely play too for sure. Smelly boy thanks for the 250. I recently asked a girl if she wanted

2130
07:39:04,740 --> 07:39:12,580
to start dating. She said yes. What are some good first dates you can recommend? Guys what is it?

2131
07:39:14,259 --> 07:39:31,799
Come on. I've talked about this before. No no I talked about this. No not the carnival. Yes

2132
07:39:32,520 --> 07:39:39,750
food network. You put on food network. One of those just diners drive-ins and dive shows.

2133
07:39:39,750 --> 07:39:48,680
It can it just it bleeds into itself. You can always talk about something. People are connected

2134
07:39:48,680 --> 07:40:00,689
so heavily by food and I'm not even talking about going and eating food. Watching food. You could

2135
07:40:00,689 --> 07:40:10,310
eat food too. And what even is a first date anymore? What even is dating a date? You're just going

2136
07:40:10,310 --> 07:40:22,340
somewhere. You just you guys are going somewhere to do something. Making dates is like added

2137
07:40:22,340 --> 07:40:35,750
pressure for both people I think. Just watch 15 episodes in a row of diners drive-ins and dives.

2138
07:40:35,750 --> 07:40:41,110
After you hang out and you're comfortable with each other after like a few times then go bowling.

2139
07:40:41,110 --> 07:40:46,369
Because look when you go bowling this is let me listen to me. When you go bowling you are going

2140
07:40:46,369 --> 07:40:51,349
to think about every single thing you're doing. You're going to think about how you're moving the

2141
07:40:51,349 --> 07:40:55,430
you're going to you have the ball in your hand. How stupid do I look right now? Did I knock down

2142
07:40:55,430 --> 07:41:00,310
any pins? Am I going to lose? Should I lose on purpose? Should I try? Should I really go for it

2143
07:41:00,709 --> 07:41:07,700
but are they going to like that? Do I look dumb right now? Do I look stupid? Did my mouth open

2144
07:41:07,700 --> 07:41:14,900
weirdly when I turned around to like to say hey I got six pins? Don't eat either. Don't go to a

2145
07:41:14,900 --> 07:41:20,720
restaurant. I will hit this hammer on the head of the nail over and over again. When you go to a

2146
07:41:20,720 --> 07:41:27,409
first or second date to a restaurant someone's watching you eat for the first time. You're like

2147
07:41:27,409 --> 07:41:34,319
scared to eat the food because like oh fuck like I don't like I don't want people to watch me eating

2148
07:41:34,319 --> 07:41:38,240
and then all of a sudden you got somebody across an incredibly potentially intimate relationship

2149
07:41:38,240 --> 07:41:42,479
and you're trying to you you don't want to like stuff your face with a hamburger. You have to

2150
07:41:42,479 --> 07:41:48,319
talk to this person. Oh so when did you go to school? Oh fuck I just took a bite. I shouldn't

2151
07:41:48,319 --> 07:42:04,290
I just took a bite and I have to speak. It's like being at the dentist. Something easy. Unless what

2152
07:42:04,290 --> 07:42:13,520
if you're going somewhere that you can eat with one hand. Maybe ice cream. That's easy. Nobody

2153
07:42:13,520 --> 07:42:17,840
looks cool eating ice cream but you're supposed to look cool eating a steak. You are. Oh let me

2154
07:42:17,840 --> 07:42:23,520
take out my fork and okay nice nice. So this meat is super. Have you tried this yet? Yeah let me cut

2155
07:42:23,520 --> 07:42:27,040
a nice thing and you don't want to be sitting there like gnawing up and down with a knife like

2156
07:42:27,759 --> 07:42:33,119
oh I scraped the plate. You need to know what the fuck you're doing. You have to pretend you know

2157
07:42:33,119 --> 07:42:37,779
what you're doing when you're eating like a steak in front of somebody. You're gonna accidentally

2158
07:42:37,779 --> 07:42:41,540
like shave off the fat part and eat it and then you're gonna have to swallow it because like what

2159
07:42:41,540 --> 07:42:54,180
are you gonna spit it out in front of them? Ice cream. Easy. One hand. Nobody cares. Milkshakes.

2160
07:42:54,180 --> 07:43:09,400
Easy. Coffee. Easy. Sip. It doesn't matter. Frozen yogurt. Yes exactly and then bring it back to the

2161
07:43:09,400 --> 07:43:14,439
house or wherever the apartment or the and watch diners drive-ins and dives. Four episodes. It's

2162
07:43:14,439 --> 07:43:24,150
all you need and then hey that was fun. We got ice cream and watched diners drive-ins and dives

2163
07:43:24,150 --> 07:43:31,680
because your eyes are focused on the screen and a movie it's like dark in a movie theater. It's like

2164
07:43:31,680 --> 07:43:38,720
weird. It's like a first date. It's like pitch black room and it's loud. You can't even talk.

2165
07:43:39,279 --> 07:43:43,619
What are you gonna turn and have a conversation to the date? No you need to be talking to this

2166
07:43:43,619 --> 07:43:50,450
person. Who gives a shit about what Guy Fieri is saying on the screen? I mean it's incredibly

2167
07:43:50,450 --> 07:43:59,759
important stuff but you can interrupt Guy Fieri and it's not a big deal. Clip that whole thing I

2168
07:43:59,759 --> 07:44:18,389
just said and then use it. I've gone on this rant before but trust me on that. All right we're uh

2169
07:44:18,389 --> 07:44:26,099
that was I have no idea. Oh Smelly Boy. It was Smelly Boy. There you go. Hope you have a good

2170
07:44:26,099 --> 07:44:37,319
date Smelly Boy. I'll show my date your old TF2 videos. It's mistake because she doesn't she might

2171
07:44:37,319 --> 07:44:50,580
not get it and then you might become the weird guy. Like Bobby Flay is just background noise.

2172
07:44:50,580 --> 07:44:56,880
I Bobby Flay is not gonna go like at any point during that show for you to be like

2173
07:44:58,400 --> 07:45:01,840
he does that sometimes. I don't know it's like funny I guess. He does I don't think that's that

2174
07:45:01,840 --> 07:45:12,099
funny though but he does it sometimes. He's just sitting there on the grill flipping hamburgers

2175
07:45:12,659 --> 07:45:19,639
and what's that? We're gonna put a special mustard on this one. Who cares that doesn't matter that's

2176
07:45:19,639 --> 07:45:31,680
not embarrassing it's interesting. Put on C-span no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

2177
07:45:31,680 --> 07:45:36,240
no no no no no no no no no she sells she sells on the seashore she sells sea seas on the seashore

2178
07:45:36,240 --> 07:45:44,049
Listen to me do not put on politics what are you out of your mind? Hey good first date. All right

2179
07:45:44,049 --> 07:45:50,380
We and you are just started dating. What are your views on politics? Sit down. Let's watch

2180
07:45:52,099 --> 07:45:54,099
That would be like, okay

2181
07:45:54,240 --> 07:46:02,340
Hope you both agree. Yeah a good first date. What a perfect first date. Let me take you to a restaurant

2182
07:46:02,340 --> 07:46:07,119
I'm gonna order a steak that I don't know how to cut and the first thing I say to you is hey

2183
07:46:07,119 --> 07:46:09,119
What do you what do you think about politics, huh?

2184
07:46:09,560 --> 07:46:15,439
Like scrape the fucking plate. Mmm piece of fat. I mean, I mean, I I

2185
07:46:15,580 --> 07:46:17,919
I

2186
07:46:17,919 --> 07:46:24,650
Just ate the whole fat thing. I had to so and he starts sweating and like sweats pouring down your head bad

2187
07:46:24,650 --> 07:46:28,330
And stamp on the put like the big thing the big red X

2188
07:46:29,130 --> 07:46:35,560
And then it shows like a couple sitting on the couch like and like the color palette is increased

2189
07:46:35,759 --> 07:46:38,720
It's not like sepia tone. You know what I mean? It is like a nice beautiful

2190
07:46:39,439 --> 07:46:41,959
Big open iris of and in the frame

2191
07:46:42,400 --> 07:46:55,909
It is like this laughter a big smiles and Guy Fieri's on that TV and you got two frozen yogurts. What time is it?

2192
07:46:55,950 --> 07:47:01,580
Okay, here we go. Thank you to

2193
07:47:01,900 --> 07:47:09,599
Doc thank you doc for the 250 doc 3660

2194
07:47:09,880 --> 07:47:14,119
German have you heard of a game called pilgrims? I feel like the humor and style is right up your alley and only take about an

2195
07:47:14,119 --> 07:47:15,560
hour

2196
07:47:15,560 --> 07:47:33,680
Pilgrims, what is this? Oh, actually I did hear about this. This is by the machinarium guys, right? Yeah, it is

2197
07:47:35,270 --> 07:47:51,479
This looks cute. Yeah, I'll play it. Definitely good juke

2198
07:47:52,159 --> 07:48:01,279
Thanks with 300 bits or 250 actually. Hey

2199
07:48:01,919 --> 07:48:03,560
we got a

2200
07:48:03,560 --> 07:48:07,119
250 from flug boy Jerma. I hey Jerma went to the Death Stranding

2201
07:48:07,680 --> 07:48:12,880
Gallery Expo in New York City tonight and I'm probably gonna go to the midnight release was wondering if you're gonna play the game at

2202
07:48:12,880 --> 07:48:18,319
All not on stream, but in general or on stream too. Hope you have fun. That sounds like an interesting time

2203
07:48:18,319 --> 07:48:26,200
I will probably not play it on stream just because it's a fairly long game and fairly

2204
07:48:26,479 --> 07:48:30,180
I'm gonna say this and I don't mean this in a negative way

2205
07:48:30,340 --> 07:48:41,200
But dragged out that and I don't mean that in a negative way. No, the words are not boring

2206
07:48:41,240 --> 07:48:43,680
It's just like takes a long time to do a lot of stuff

2207
07:48:43,959 --> 07:48:47,459
Thank you. It takes a very long time to get anywhere or do anything

2208
07:48:47,459 --> 07:48:49,979
That's that's the whole nature of the game, isn't it?

2209
07:48:50,259 --> 07:48:56,369
Isn't the whole entire video game based around dragging something up?

2210
07:48:56,369 --> 07:49:14,360
I will absolutely play it off stream, but it's something I probably just sit on my couch and do it's a pizza delivery boy game

2211
07:49:15,319 --> 07:49:25,599
Play Death Stranding for your first date. No, I

2212
07:49:26,479 --> 07:49:28,720
Honest to God, I do not mean that in a negative way

2213
07:49:28,919 --> 07:49:33,639
I mean that in like I foresee myself just walking in a straight line

2214
07:49:34,159 --> 07:49:39,639
With a briefcase in my hands for like 25 straight minutes and just cut trying it like what are we gonna talk about?

2215
07:49:41,139 --> 07:49:46,409
Podcast here we go. It has eight hours of cutscenes

2216
07:49:47,209 --> 07:49:57,860
That's not the type of game that I would stream. Does it actually have eight hours of cutscenes?

2217
07:49:58,020 --> 07:50:12,139
That's the entire extended edition of Lord of the Rings all of them. Wow, I've already made that reference, but I'll make it again

2218
07:50:12,659 --> 07:50:19,840
But the answer is probably no. I hope you enjoy it. I look forward to it as well

2219
07:50:19,840 --> 07:50:29,869
We'll see how good it is. Hey Dino Pulse Zetta. Thanks for the 500 bits. How you been Jerma been wondering

2220
07:50:29,869 --> 07:50:31,990
Who do you think you'd want for a DLC fighter in smash?

2221
07:50:32,430 --> 07:50:36,389
There's many that I want but I'd love to hear your thoughts PS. There's an awesome Mega Man outfit

2222
07:50:36,389 --> 07:50:39,430
You can unlock in the game. Thanks to Keiji Inafune

2223
07:50:40,150 --> 07:51:06,840
Being the game designer. I said that name so wrong. Who do I want in smash Scrooge McDuck final answer Disney

2224
07:51:06,840 --> 07:51:11,400
Yeah, but the pogo stick the move set the gems

2225
07:51:12,669 --> 07:51:20,459
Would make a perfect move set you can incorporate the pogo somehow and he was an original Nintendo star

2226
07:51:20,860 --> 07:51:28,119
But he's Disney. So yeah, not inspect a gadget. He wasn't in a love Nintendo game. He had a shitty Nintendo game

2227
07:51:28,119 --> 07:51:45,209
There's a difference. What about Gino? Yeah, but I've talked about that before but that's just that's long shot territory

2228
07:51:45,209 --> 07:51:52,169
What's the best way to reach you for business conversations? I do not have a way

2229
07:51:52,169 --> 07:52:07,599
I lock myself in a cave and don't come out. There's a computer in here and there's

2230
07:52:08,599 --> 07:52:18,810
500 Campbell's chunky chicken noodle soups in here. I just don't come out but that's the real answer though

2231
07:52:19,049 --> 07:52:39,009
Not I mean that I don't like do like take business propositions not the living in a cave part Campbell's chunky

2232
07:52:39,009 --> 07:52:45,560
I love those canned soups. I think they're fantastic

2233
07:52:46,279 --> 07:52:53,689
but Scrooge

2234
07:52:54,090 --> 07:53:00,650
Nose stuffed up when I said Scrooge McDuck and I said the D and then my nose closed Scrooge McDuck

2235
07:53:00,970 --> 07:53:07,430
And then dino pulse again a thousand bits from dino pulse. Oh, it's the same thing

2236
07:53:07,430 --> 07:53:10,299
I think it was a double bit message

2237
07:53:12,000 --> 07:53:21,740
But thank you for the 1500 bits dino. Appreciate it green 500 castle crashes with Josh Tucker

2238
07:53:21,740 --> 07:53:34,279
It was Josh Tucker. I don't know who that is. I've already played through castle crashes

2239
07:53:34,279 --> 07:53:41,560
It's four or five times. So I would not play through castle crashes again

2240
07:53:41,560 --> 07:53:49,130
I've already done it many times years and years and years ago. It's a great game though. Very good

2241
07:53:49,490 --> 07:53:54,369

2254
07:55:51,659 --> 07:55:55,779
No, I'm not gonna say it out loud because then somebody will clip it and put it somewhere and make somebody really mad or something

2255
07:55:56,740 --> 07:56:01,360
Let me say something else like if no, I'm not gonna say that I think somebody will put that

2256
07:56:01,520 --> 07:56:11,840
Okay, you know the guy with the mustache that everybody loves that jumps around and jumps on people. What's his name? That's the name

Yes, you guys saying all right

2258
07:56:13,720 --> 07:56:20,450
So what if I said I I will never play one of those games because I don't think that I don't think they're interesting

2259
07:56:20,450 --> 07:56:23,959
I don't not into it. What if I said that how many of you would be angry?

2260
07:56:23,959 --> 07:56:33,229
I think a lot of people would be like that's kind of annoying like why would you do that?

2261
07:56:33,229 --> 07:56:39,799
Fuck you. So if I said I I'm not gonna watch this show. It's not I don't I'm not into it

2262
07:56:39,799 --> 07:56:51,639
I don't want it. What the fuck did you say? So from here on out no more opinions ever again

2263
07:56:52,319 --> 07:57:03,250
I'm gonna have to confirm nor deny anything that I do. I love

2264
07:57:03,930 --> 07:57:09,970
Mario it's a he's iconic and perfect except for Mario 3d world burn that game

2265
07:57:09,970 --> 07:57:15,409
I just said I wasn't gonna give opinions and I just gave a really really really fired up one

2266
07:57:15,409 --> 07:57:28,200
I love I love Mario Mario 64 Mario Galaxy Mario Odyssey. Holy shit. These are phenomenal video games

2267
07:57:29,400 --> 07:57:34,459
Unbelievable some of the best games I've ever played just like it in the top 20 always

2268
07:57:36,259 --> 07:57:40,740
Super Mario fucking 3d world is not one of them

2269
07:57:40,740 --> 07:57:48,150
I'm sorry, that's my opinion

2270
07:57:55,380 --> 07:58:04,279
Rock goes through my window

2271
07:58:04,400 --> 07:58:20,830

2273
07:58:48,380 --> 07:58:57,590
Play it on stream. I've never played it. I've seen it. I

2274
07:58:58,470 --> 07:59:06,220
I think I've held the controller for like a few minutes is better than 64

2275
07:59:07,259 --> 07:59:28,709
I just almost that hurt. What what did you just say? They're right. There's so many video games. Hey wizard rivet

2276
07:59:28,709 --> 07:59:32,150
Thanks for the 500 bits term of watching your videos for five years

2277
07:59:33,590 --> 07:59:37,189
Recently, I signed into the Canadian military and I'll be leaving for basic training on Saturday

2278
07:59:37,189 --> 07:59:41,069
I won't be able to watch your streams for a while. So just wanted to let you know how much I love them

Good luck. Thank you so much for being around look forward to seeing you when you come back

2280
07:59:54,259 --> 08:00:00,349
Thanks for being around as long as you have good luck to you in the military

2281
08:00:01,110 --> 08:00:09,540
Much love to you. So I'm gonna say it's hilarious if you think any Mario game is better than 64

2282
08:00:12,139 --> 08:00:15,919
mmm, I

2283
08:00:15,919 --> 08:00:16,959
think

2284
08:00:16,959 --> 08:00:30,659
People put Mario 64 just at number one like s plus tier always even if they don't believe it because I think

2285
08:00:34,029 --> 08:00:36,029
Super Mario World is

2286
08:00:40,560 --> 08:00:41,959
Probably

2287
08:00:41,959 --> 08:00:46,159
number one for the Super Nintendo

2288
08:00:49,599 --> 08:00:56,080
Hmm. Yeah, it probably is Mario 64. But every well, what's the best Mario game ever made?

2289
08:00:56,080 --> 08:01:02,529
People just call Mario 64. Obviously, did I have more fun in 64 for the first time or

2290
08:01:03,250 --> 08:01:08,479
Mario World or Galaxy or even Galaxy 2 or Odyssey?

2291
08:01:17,040 --> 08:01:21,000
Interesting question paper Mario. I have to play that too

2292
08:01:21,599 --> 08:01:31,319
Mario RPG. Yeah, but I'm super biased on that one. Yeah

2293
08:01:31,840 --> 08:01:41,520

2297

Antiharis magic storage potion seller auto trash. What is this?

2298
08:02:30,319 --> 08:02:32,229

2299

2300
