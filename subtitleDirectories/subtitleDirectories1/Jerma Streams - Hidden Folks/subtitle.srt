1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:19,589
Wait, hold on. I didn't clear my throat before turning on the microphone. So that's my fault.

2
00:00:20,629 --> 00:00:26,949
Hi guys. Why was everybody striking? I said, hey, we're on strike. We're on strike.

3
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:40,619
We're on strike. We're on strike. We're on strike. Why? What? What happened? What did I do? We already

4
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:52,659
forgot why. Look, I already know. I already know about the blank space thing. I was on my phone

5
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:58,649
checking in 20 minutes ago or so. And I just see a bunch of blank spaces, blank spaces,

6
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:01,130
blank, blank, blank. And I'm like, what's going on? I thought it was a bug on my iPhone.

7
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:06,569
It's not. I've already seen it. I thought it was funny. I laughed at it for a minute.

8
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:14,390
So, all right, you got me. Congratulations. I thought there was no stream today.

9
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:28,650
How did this stream today? What do you mean? Last night we streamed late and I said we're

10
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:41,739
going to go tomorrow too. We tricked him. Yes. Are you going to destroy any more marriages today?

11
00:01:41,739 --> 00:01:45,290
I hope not. No, we're going to, we're going to dial it back a little bit.

12
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:48,810
We're going to play. Well, actually, that's, I say that, you know, I'm not, I'm going to stop

13
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:54,890
saying that because every time I say that, every single time that this live stream you've heard

14
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:59,049
German nine, eight, five say, we're going to dial it back tonight. We're going to just chill

15
00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:05,049
and play a game and hang out and relax for a few hours. It ends up being like a 15 hour stream.

16
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:12,169
And I lose like 300 hair follicles. So what, you know what? This stream is going to be crazy.

17
00:02:12,169 --> 00:02:16,169
It's going to be nuts. I'm going to go nuts on this stream. Okay. That's how, you know,

18
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:25,770
it's not going to happen. My nose blocked up. No, no, my voice sounds nasally. I don't know. Am I?

19
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:34,650
Maybe I got a little, maybe a little, maybe just a little bit. Yeah, maybe a little as I can. It's

20
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:45,189
kind of dusty and allergy out here today, but my voice gets deep. Look, my voice has three or four

21
00:02:45,189 --> 00:02:52,780
different places where it sits. This is what I sound like if I, when I don't speak with a little

22
00:02:52,780 --> 00:03:00,900
slightly nasally blocked up nose for like 10 hours in six hours. If you keep watching the stream,

23
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,780
two or three, four hours from now, my voice is going to sound different. It's going to sound

24
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,419
a little higher like this because I've been speaking for a long time. I'm very boisterous

25
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:13,240
right now because I haven't had, there's been no words coming out of my mouth. It's basic science.

26
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:26,099
I literally cannot tell a difference and neither can I. Thanks for coming to class.

27
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:37,800
We're going to play hidden folks today, which is a hidden person object game. I've been told

28
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,759
it's really, really fun. I've been told it's, I would, I was told you're going to love this game.

29
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:55,129
I'm like, okay. Am I though? Like, we'll see. Wrong. Well, there's one thing that I do know for

30
00:03:55,129 --> 00:04:02,889
certain. We'll switch over to it now. It's, um, what you're about to hear is, well, not that. I

31
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:07,610
mean, that's pretty cool. It was a rumor. You're about to hear every single German nine eight five

32
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:41,560
stream from start to finish. I don't even need to say anything. I should just put this on repeat.

33
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:53,240
Okay. I've made all of these noises before, all of them multiple times.

34
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,920
It's hurts. It hurts to hear this. Anyways, I've, I don't know how this game works. I know you've

35
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:05,000
you have to, it's hidden folks. It's like looking in the mirror and I don't want, I don't know,

36
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,819
no more looking in the mirror. It's kind of, it's, uh, it hurts my eyes. Hold on.

37
00:05:15,689 --> 00:05:19,750
That's better. Which one of these things is better?

38
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:26,459
I don't, I don't like the, all right. Jeremy's,

39
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:34,420
Jerma shut up for a second. I'm trying to talk. I think this one is good. Dark mode always. Yeah.

40
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:44,540
Yeah. He just spit on me. I'll do them all.

41
00:05:44,540 --> 00:06:10,540
Oh, this looks worse somehow. Explore Garland is fascinated by the tongue of this reptile.

42
00:06:16,069 --> 00:06:23,670
I mean, this is the reptile. There it is. That was, hold on. We need less. We need less German

43
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:34,709
noises. It's already, hold on. All right. That's better. All right. I got it. There it is. Now,

44
00:06:34,709 --> 00:06:54,420
what do you want? Isn't that the tongue of the reptile? Now what do you want? Fascinated by the

45
00:06:54,420 --> 00:07:00,819
tongue of this reptile. This big snake is a real bush crawler. This looks worse though.

46
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,399
I really like this game. Hold on.

47
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:21,990
Oh, that's, hold on. What about the sepia one? Oh, this is, this is all right. This is okay.

48
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:30,629
What does yellow look like? Not bad actually, but I, I need it to be a little bit darker.

49
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:37,110
Yeah. This is better. Should have, maybe I should darken it up a little.

50
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:49,079
This is cool though. Yeah. We're in night mode. Okay. So I got, got you. There's a brightness

51
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:56,360
setting. Oh, is there? Yeah, we got, that's better. Ah, all right. We can get this right.

52
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:10,699
Let's do. Yup. That's what I'm thinking. That's what I'm thinking. Nope. Nope. Nope.

53
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:19,129
I'm going to, it's going to, I don't know who's talking.

54
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,350
This is what I'm going with right here. This is perfect. Okay. Here we go.

55
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:34,460
The big snake is, I look for a snake. Snake. I got the chameleon.

56
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:48,710
There's a snake. Anybody see a snake? I don't see a snake. The land of the Jermas. I don't see a

57
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:56,549
snake. Kiki the monkey loves a good soft shelter. I can, I can cut stuff down.

58
00:08:56,549 --> 00:09:20,759
Oh, Oh, okay. I get it. I get it. I understand too loud. All right. I'll fix it. I get it. Okay.

59
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:29,240
So now we need to find the snake, the big snake. That's still so loud. Okay. We've got a wink.

60
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:45,000
Okay. Now we need to find the snake. This big snake is a bush crawler.

61
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:53,750
So we need to find the snake. Got the snake. Big snake. It's still so loud.

62
00:09:53,750 --> 00:10:09,909
You watched me fucking turn it down. Okay. Now we need Kiki the monkey. It's not you. You in here.

63
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:23,769
A good soft. Okay. Kiki the monkey. Now what? The only ripe white banana is pretty much up for grabs.

64
00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:30,389
Oh, isn't everything white in here? Like it's, I can't, there's no, it's too loud. What do you

65
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:41,940
want me to do? The only ripe white banana. Everything is, I can't, there's nothing here.

66
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:55,320
Ripe banana. Pull one of these things. Oh, oh, oh, got it. This game is fucking not even,

67
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,299
I almost just said not even fun. I meant to say not even hard. You found everything here.

68
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:11,580
Stay here a little longer. Enter the jungle. Oh boy. Well, now this is a, oh, that was the

69
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:19,259
tutorial. Now we play the real game. For this man in distress, the uncomfortable seat is the

70
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:27,990
least of his troubles. Okay. What else we got? Why are they, why do we still have to hear they're

71
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:43,139
like, if you ask classy Jesse, treetop naps are the best. Treetop. There you go. This game hurts

72
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:59,220
my eyes, man. Sorry. This woman with a guitar plays music that will warm the hearts of men and

73
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:08,789
reptiles. Guitar. I don't even need 10 seconds. Zoom. You zoomer. What do you mean? No. Why would

74
00:12:08,789 --> 00:12:14,009
I? Oh my God. No, why would I? Oh, that you can move to. Why would I want to do that? I could see

75
00:12:14,009 --> 00:12:25,480
everything here. Oh no. Wishes he had paid more attention during his Tai Chi classes. That you?

76
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:40,820
No. See, why would I zoom in? Okay. And there's woohoo. I'm looking for silhouettes. That's what

77
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:46,440
I'm looking for here. And I, I can, I, I, I can see everything. I can scan this whole environment

78
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:55,450
in one second. Just look, I'm looking for that exact silhouette. My brain has not found it yet.

79
00:12:55,450 --> 00:13:05,659
Silhouettes. That's all we're looking for here. There it is. Told you.

80
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:27,320
Fluffy Panda does what Fluffy Pandas do. Eat. Scan the environment. Okay. End in five, four, three,

81
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:54,230
two, one. Fluffy Panda eats. Fluffy Panda eats. Who told him to play this? I don't like 300 people.

82
00:13:54,230 --> 00:14:08,580
I'm not done with this yet. Relax. Relax. It's been five minutes. Fluffy Panda likes to eat.

83
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:15,830
It's been 15. We spent five minutes introducing, six minutes picking a color and five minutes in

84
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:28,679
the game. Fluffy Panda. Oh, I can, I forgot I can interact with the environment. Fluffy Panda eats.

85
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:46,379
What is it? Say it again. Where are you? I'm just destroying the whole entire forest to look for

86
00:14:46,379 --> 00:14:57,460
this one. Got him. Oh, I did it. Wait, stay here. There's more to do. The others watch jealousy

87
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:12,470
while King Kiki sits on his throne of bananas. Oh, wait, no, he's got a crown. Where's the monkey

88
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:29,830
with the crown? Got you. He sits on the throne of lies. What are you talking about? Long elegant

89
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:49,720
birds lay long elegant eggs. Just give, just give us a few minutes. I like this. All right,

90
00:15:49,720 --> 00:16:00,340
let's go. Let's check the next area. Help that walking folk get across. How do I do that?

91
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:14,840
These snakes? How do you, oh, move. Please stop. I'm high as fuck. This game's scaring me.

92
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:26,940
Dude, you're fine. It's not that big of a deal. All right, with the noises, maybe,

93
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:36,090
maybe I could see what you're talking about. Please. I'm working high. What are you doing?

94
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:57,580
Cut it down. Make this louder. I'm not going to make it louder. I have to get this bridge over

95
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:17,049
here. Oh, I can pull things. I have to click and hold. I like this game because just because of

96
00:17:17,049 --> 00:17:33,319
this. Cut it down so you can get through. It's just because of the Adam Sandler noises. That's

97
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:44,890
why you want to keep playing. That's kind of an interesting game. That's not even an Adam Sandler

98
00:17:44,890 --> 00:18:03,000
noise. I'm sorry. I disagree. This game's fucking disturbing. It's a cute little hidden object game.

99
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,670
Why? Oh, dude, I'm on drugs. What the fuck? You can't do an activity that's in like an

100
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:22,119
eight-year-old's book when you're like high, apparently, but I probably can't. Yeah. The

101
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:30,579
guitar is having a real good conversation with the swing. Got it. Jerma's freaking out. Dude,

102
00:18:30,579 --> 00:18:39,049
you're on crack, man. Stop being. Aiden really wants to be found. Yeah, what are you smoking?

103
00:18:39,049 --> 00:18:45,660
What do you do? What drugs are you taking? Oh, man, the swears, the swears. Waldo fucking game. I

104
00:18:45,660 --> 00:19:03,500
can't. Oh, it's coming at me. The walls are closing now. Air bed. I'm too high for this, man.

105
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:12,630
Jerma, I love this game. Also, I had my bunny. What? What happened? Wait, what did it say?

106
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:20,819
Jerma, I love this game. I had my bunny since September. I have somebody help me name the

107
00:19:20,819 --> 00:19:30,539
bunny. It's an all black bunny. How about, uh, how about, I don't know, um, uh, how about, uh,

108
00:19:31,339 --> 00:19:39,099
Jetson? Yeah, that's pretty good. All right, what's this one? With filthy hands, the bullies

109
00:19:39,099 --> 00:19:46,150
quickly return to the campfire. Ella will never find her hairbrush. All right, which one of the

110
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:58,519
bullies has the hair? I did not get it. Filthy hands. It's in, it's inside the fire. Pepper's

111
00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:12,380
pretty good. Pepper is pretty good, you know. Where's his hairbrush? Wait, no, I thought that

112
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:23,930
was gonna be in there. With filthy hands? Jerma, quick, say something funny. Sure. Ban that guy

113
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:31,829
for expecting me to be his personal clown. Funny enough for you.

114
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:49,210
All right, I'm done. I'm not doing this anymore. This is too much. No, I'm not. I'm still here.

115
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:57,670
We got a wink? You said I shaved? Nobody even commented on that. Why has nobody commented on

116
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:07,400
the fact that I shaved? Like, I mean, I do something and nobody's seen, nobody notices.

117
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:27,210
We couldn't see. Yes, you could. All right, where are we going? Beekeeper Barry. I'm still here. I

118
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:34,339
mean, guys, everybody relax. Relax. This is just, this is the pregame. Relax. This is the pregame

119
00:21:34,339 --> 00:21:42,519
to Mega Man Legends. I wanted to play this for a little, for a little bit. But guys, everybody

120
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:52,710
just cool. Just cool off. You have an Instagram filter on. I do not have an Instagram filter on.

121
00:21:52,710 --> 00:22:04,329
I don't even know how to use that. Beekeeper, Beekeeper Barry. All right, there's the bees.

122
00:22:05,049 --> 00:22:11,640
Beekeeper Barry, where is he? Beekeeper Barry.

123
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:28,140
Fuck, I'm getting interested. Harriet, am I making the bee sounds? No. What if I just stay here for

124
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:41,049
like five hours and just play this all day? Am I? All right, listen. Mai releases every butterfly

125
00:22:41,049 --> 00:23:02,470
she catches. That's why there's still so many of them here. Oh, no. Where are you? Where are you?

126
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:14,220
You're going to only have one viewer of me. I'm not even watching my own stream. What you meant

127
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:21,349
to say was zero. That means I would have to have my own stream open, which I don't. Let me just find

128
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:31,289
Mai, please. I want to check this game out. I got Mega Man Legends sitting in the tray right now.

129
00:23:31,289 --> 00:23:57,380
What tray? In the PS2 tray? I like this game. You guys are too harsh. Where are the butterflies? Wait,

130
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:06,650
I see a butterfly right here. That's a clue. Let's see you foster this harshness.

131
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:15,990
Don't blame me. I'm playing the game. I'm playing this game. I like this game. What do you mean?

132
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:22,309
If I was fostering something, I'd be fostering you enjoying this game because I like it. That's me

133
00:24:22,309 --> 00:24:45,049
fostering. I got to find this person. No Mega Man until I find this person. By liking the game,

134
00:24:45,049 --> 00:24:54,359
you make chat hate it. What am I, your parents? What are you? What? Dude, I found this really

135
00:24:54,359 --> 00:25:00,519
cool game today called Hidden Folks. No way, dude. Is it fun? Yeah, it's so cool, dude. You like find

136
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:06,069
monsters and pigs and there's fucking people here. Dude, that's awesome. Let's play it. Oh,

137
00:25:06,069 --> 00:25:12,259
I'm so into it. We're both hitting or hovering over our desk. The fucking door opens. What are

138
00:25:12,259 --> 00:25:16,470
you boys doing in there? Oh, we're just playing this game called Hidden Folks, Ma. You wouldn't

139
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:22,789
even like it. You're an idiot older. Oh, Hidden Folks. What are you looking for? Ma? Oh, she's

140
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:29,529
right over here. Boys, if you need help with anything else, especially with Lumberjack Fleck,

141
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:36,299
I know where that is too. I beat this game last night. Fuck out of here, Ma. Fine. I don't even

142
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:45,289
like this game, Ma. Mike, do you like this game? Yeah, you do. Fucking loser. No, I don't. This

143
00:25:45,289 --> 00:25:55,099
game's a fucking loser. Yeah, I don't like it either. What am I doing right now? All right,

144
00:25:55,099 --> 00:26:02,619
I'm like projecting, I'm fostering some hatred here on you guys. That's all right. All right.

145
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:14,470
Let's go. I'm going to play Mega Man Legends, but I have to find these people first.

146
00:26:17,049 --> 00:26:21,940
I'm not leaving until I find the bat. I don't care. I don't care if every single person leaves

147
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:38,230
this frame. I have to, I'm going to beat this level. Are these every butterfly she catches?

148
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:54,730
That's why there's still so many of them. Found the bat. Monster Mo. All right, what about this

149
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:58,730
one? We'll go back to this. Hayden tried to escape the internet, but he put his tent next to the

150
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:20,359
only Wi-Fi point of the campground. Is there a cell tower here? Oh, I found her. Hayden tried to

151
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:29,740
escape the internet. It's over here. Campground's over here, right? No, the campground's down here.

152
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:43,579
Oh, there's the Wi-Fi spot. Where is he? Is that a secret? No. There you are. Got it.

153
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:51,500
Mom, can we please play Mega Man? No, not until you've done your homework, which is

154
00:27:52,859 --> 00:28:00,730
watch this guy play hidden folks as your only assignment. You can't even do that. What the

155
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:12,740
heck? No ice cream for you after dinner. Who's this dog? The sun is shining too brightly today,

156
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:21,660
even for classy Jessie. That's not her. For all an unusual punishment.

157
00:28:23,259 --> 00:28:35,380
Key? This is satisfying. It's a really satisfying game. What about this one? Lumberjack? What's that?

158
00:28:36,019 --> 00:28:59,829
Sun is shining too brightly on like a beach camping. In the car? Maybe you're in the car.

159
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:19,480
I don't know where she is. This is kind of fucked up, by the way.

160
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:48,970
I'm just some otherworldly force opening up everybody's tents. No, no. Where are you? Right

161
00:29:48,970 --> 00:30:05,700
here? No. No. Oh, chat. Vote on this. You don't vote on an unofficial poll. Guys, the unofficial

162
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:15,769
poll is the same thing as... All right. If you guys all... Unofficial poll. That's like watching

163
00:30:15,769 --> 00:30:21,930
a TV show and being like, oh man, I really hope they kill off this character next.

164
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:28,920
Let's all vote for it and send it to the fucking CEO at Disney. CEO at Disney is going to read it

165
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:36,140
and be like, what's this? Who do they want? Who do they want to die next to the show? Oh, I would

166
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:42,069
throw it in the trash, but I get fucking a hundred of these a week and the trash is full every day.

167
00:30:42,069 --> 00:31:03,140
So I'm just going to rip it in half. Recycle this, please. Where is this person? At least he's

168
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:16,359
recycling. Not realistic. Disney CEO wouldn't recycle. She's classy. Yeah, but what does that

169
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:34,700
mean? I mean, look at the results. Where are the... What is the poll? Let me see it. Let me see it.

170
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:45,640
It says, do you think Jerma could beat this game? No. Omega lol. Yes. Oh, I see what's going on here.

171
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:52,119
Okay. This is really interesting part of the stream. This is like a thousand of you. This is

172
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:56,200
very interesting. So like about, but probably like 700 of you are like, no, I want him to keep

173
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:01,450
fucking playing this game. Like I like this game. This is like kind of cool experience. This is like

174
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:07,130
fun to me. So let's say, let's make him think he can't beat it. So then he stays and tries to

175
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:10,809
prove us wrong. It works, but the Lord of the Rings, Fellowship of the Ring, it has to work

176
00:32:10,809 --> 00:32:14,569
with something like this because he's already interested. It's not going to work. I already

177
00:32:14,569 --> 00:32:42,390
know that. The sun is shining too brightly. Are there more than one campground? It's working.

178
00:32:43,289 --> 00:32:44,569
Chat, keep up the pressure.

179
00:32:59,829 --> 00:33:06,900
Classy Jesse found anybody who likes this game. Also, I'm not reading the rest of that. What the

180
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:12,579
fuck are you talking about? Lumberjack. All right, we got one more. Lumberjack flex stands in front

181
00:33:12,579 --> 00:33:23,380
of his grand final challenge. Forest or a tree or wood or cutting or like a huge tree or something.

182
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:41,029
I mean, there's a bunch of trees. Zuma was a big tree. That's pretty big. That's pretty big.

183
00:33:41,029 --> 00:33:48,089
Not that big though. That's there it is. He's blind. He's blind. He's blind. He's blind. He's

184
00:33:48,089 --> 00:33:57,849
blind. He's blind. He's blind. No, I can't move on. Oh shit. This banana was parked into a fruit

185
00:33:57,849 --> 00:34:08,599
basket. What about this one? This truffle is about to be discovered by a hog. Together with her bunny,

186
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:12,920
friends, Black Bitty hides in a hole chewing on some snatched wheat.

187
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:21,380
Ivan hitched a ride without permission. It doesn't have an escape plan. What are you guys doing right

188
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:36,059
now? I don't get it. I don't understand. What does this have to do with anything going on right now?

189
00:34:36,059 --> 00:34:59,500
Is that what you think I'm doing right now? Somebody wrote LUL fuck chat. Do what you want to do.

190
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:11,610
Oh, I am. See, I said Mega Man Legends was coming, but I don't even own that game. I just made that

191
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:18,820
up completely. I don't have that. This spider has a particular taste. All right. There was a spider

192
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:39,219
over here. I don't understand. Fuck me. I don't even own Mega Man Legends. I just own Mega Man

193
00:35:39,219 --> 00:35:55,190
Legends 2. I have to fucking have the sequel and not the first one. What's wrong with my floor?

194
00:35:56,070 --> 00:36:09,670
I just picked up the PlayStation 2 controller instead of the mouse. Hi, nice to see you. It's

195
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:13,190
time for Mega Man. It's not time for Mega Man. You'll know when it's time for Mega Man.

196
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:20,539
It's how you know it's time for me to switch a game. I usually don't talk for about 30 straight

197
00:36:20,539 --> 00:36:34,659
seconds. I go, all right. Okay. That's cool. I haven't done that yet. Usually it's a lot of,

198
00:36:36,099 --> 00:36:44,760
all right, where's this thing? Cool. When you hear me fill air time, because there's nothing

199
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:48,570
interesting going on for me in the game or I have nothing interesting to tell you. That's how you

200
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:57,500
know like to start the countdown for about five minutes. All right. Rock pile, rock pile.

201
00:37:05,179 --> 00:37:11,500
Dog, cool dog. Yeah. Saying things that I'm currently touching or what just the actual

202
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:16,389
noun. That's how you know it's like the person's done with the game they're playing. Because I'm

203
00:37:16,389 --> 00:37:22,949
a streamer, right? So it's like, was it just dead air? No, I'm not going to have dead air.

204
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:36,010
Tractor riding along in the tractor. Oh, beep beep. You know, tractors. That's how you know.

205
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:40,099
And this is not just me. This is every streamer you've ever watched. You'll see it. You'll,

206
00:37:40,099 --> 00:37:47,989
you can see it now. You'll know. All right. Ivan hitched a ride without permission.

207
00:37:47,989 --> 00:37:54,360
Doesn't have an escape plan. So he's over here. He's like under the one of the cars.

208
00:37:55,159 --> 00:38:08,500
That's not him. It's to ride without permission. No, saying the thing like this, saying any word

209
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:17,929
or phrase like this. Okay. It's to ride without permission. No. All right. I'm not doing that

210
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:33,820
anymore. All right. Where is he? Where is he? Over here? Nope. He's lying down somewhere.

211
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:43,940
Wow.

212
00:38:59,139 --> 00:39:04,489
If he was going to be somewhere, he'd be down here. It's beaker.

213
00:39:04,489 --> 00:39:13,510
Beaker. No, that's not beaker. Let's get him to do a whole symphony though. Cover your ears.

214
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:23,619
It's probably going to hurt. Can't figure out what's, what's germa and what's this game.

215
00:39:23,619 --> 00:39:33,690
What's germa? What's germa? Well, what's germa? I can help you out there. What's germa? What's

216
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:43,929
germa? But I, but that's a good question. If I were to think, well, let's answer the second

217
00:39:43,929 --> 00:39:49,219
question first. Second question is, this is a hidden folks game about hidden objects,

218
00:39:49,219 --> 00:40:10,869
but here's the thing. What is germa? Hey you, person that just landed on the channel page.

219
00:40:10,869 --> 00:40:15,590
What's going on? My name is germa985. Or you can just call me germa. That's what most people around

220
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:20,230
here call me. I'm a gaming channel. You probably could guess that by all the different playlists

221
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:25,269
and all the videos below, which you should check out and you should go watch some of them right now

222
00:40:25,269 --> 00:40:29,429
and possibly subscribe. That's the whole purpose of this video. I'm trying to get you to subscribe

223
00:40:29,429 --> 00:40:33,590
to my channel. So hey, subscribe to the channel. Subscribe. You see on this channel, I like to call

224
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:39,909
myself Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Germa, because I have two different sides. I have the very professional

225
00:40:39,909 --> 00:40:45,909
side where I review content and I review packages. What? I don't review packages. No, I don't do that.

226
00:40:45,909 --> 00:40:51,269
I review like games. Oh, here's like, here's a cup. This cup is good. There's a whole lot of stuff

227
00:40:51,269 --> 00:40:57,989
here though. I have my fun. I have my professional side and I mold them together into sort of this

228
00:40:57,989 --> 00:41:03,510
lunacy that is germa985. So hopefully this little trailer will be able to give you an explanation.

229
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:09,510
Did you review packages at once? You subscribe as well. So please subscribe, subscribe,

230
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:14,389
and subscribe. And I'll subscribe to you all next time. And of course, subscribe, subscribe.

231
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:21,860
Oh, I hate it. I hate it. Hey, what is going on everybody? Hey, what is going on everybody?

232
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:27,539
Hey, what is going on everybody? Germa here. Who is this guy anyway? To gameplay commentary.

233
00:41:27,539 --> 00:41:32,500
Meet me at the statue at 12 o'clock. Okay. I don't know what the statue is. I don't play this game.

234
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:37,619
No, what? Oh, what was that? You were going to bank what? What were you going to do?

235
00:41:40,099 --> 00:41:47,059
Oh, there we go. So of course, as Mario, you have to do all the dirty work because

236
00:41:47,699 --> 00:41:52,900
you can jump real high. I never understood that by the way that why does Mario have to do everything?

237
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:56,500
He's like the savior of the world because he can jump higher than Michael Jordan.

238
00:41:57,219 --> 00:42:02,579
Right. Left or right. We're going to go left. Oh man.

239
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:13,900
Fucking scary game. I knew it. I knew what was going to happen too. And it still doesn't matter.

240
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:18,699
What I'm talking about here is you'll see it. I go like me, me, me, me, almost like I'm sweeping

241
00:42:18,699 --> 00:42:24,300
the screen, not with my mouse, but with my A and D keys. And it's something I don't know why I do

242
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:29,019
this. And I think it's because I have a lot of trouble aiming with the mouse more so than I do,

243
00:42:29,019 --> 00:42:34,059
which just kind of getting people in front of my cross here, but I kill every single person almost

244
00:42:34,059 --> 00:42:48,329
by doing the sway in quotes. Oh no, I'm dead. Who did this? It's Otto. Okay. I don't want to alarm

245
00:42:48,329 --> 00:42:54,170
anybody here, but I'm sorry. I may have taken a shit in your house. Being one of the top 10 players

246
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:59,530
in the world. That's right. This is Germany's grandfather here. Not Germany. He's not as good

247
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:04,730
as me. He can't give me the tips. He can't give me the strategies that I can. So let me just tell

248
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:09,130
you that I'm one of the best players in the world and I'll show you right here. Look at this. Get the

249
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:15,769
fuck out of here, buddy. Let me tell you. Did I really have this in me the whole time? And the

250
00:43:15,769 --> 00:43:21,530
answer is yes. Yes. Everybody does. We all do. Everybody has it in them. You have it in you. You

251
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:25,530
do do it. You can actually do it. Oh, you just have to tell yourself it's possible and you have

252
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:44,869
to act on those possibilities. Oh, what a sick trick. Hi guys. Today we're going to create a

253
00:43:44,869 --> 00:43:52,469
fucking washer dryer on Jeremy's channel. This is so long. All right, fine. Right here. So he

254
00:43:52,469 --> 00:43:58,550
already finished it. So thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it and hopefully

255
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:04,869
you subscribe to his channel. Hopefully I have convinced you to do that and you can be part of

256
00:44:04,869 --> 00:44:09,909
our little community here, The Germs. So join The Germs. I hope to see you all in the comments

257
00:44:09,909 --> 00:44:14,949
section and thank you for watching again. So take care everybody. I'll see you all soon.

258
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:22,630
So that's somebody. Who's German on A5? That's who he is. Did you subscribe to

259
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:35,699
the channel yet? I don't know. That video needed to be three and a half minutes shorter than it was,

260
00:44:36,739 --> 00:44:51,260
but this is like 2011 YouTube. Come on. Delete that video on stream. That video actually does

261
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:58,380
not exist anymore. It's like, I think that's a private. This video is private. I just showed

262
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:16,389
you a private video or unlisted at least. Make that your sub sub. All right. Anyways, what were

263
00:45:16,389 --> 00:45:20,550
we doing? So the person that just came in, what is, what is German? I don't get it. And what is

264
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:25,909
this? Hopefully we answered both those questions. You probably left 15 seconds into that video.

265
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:33,380
But if you were still here, thanks for watching. All right. So we got the spider. I was over here.

266
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:40,739
I saw the spider web right there. It's right here. What do you mean? It's right here.

267
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:59,369
Video shouldn't be public. Actually the video should not be public. I don't know. Whatever.

268
00:45:59,369 --> 00:46:10,059
But it has like 30,000 views. Save it quick. I'm not, what do you think? I'm going to just

269
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:19,940
delete that video. I got to get this one. I haven't hitched a ride without permission.

270
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:33,460
It's gotta be like this car park here. Is he just inside one of these?

271
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:43,030
There's no escape. Super Bruce. Thanks for the six community subs. Thank you Bruce.

272
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:56,380
Thanks for the subs. Hey, thanks for subscribing to the channel. All right. I need, I gotta, I gotta

273
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:59,260
level with chat here for a second. A lot of you guys might be newer viewers. Listen to me.

274
00:47:00,699 --> 00:47:09,079
There was a time, I'll get on cam for this. There was a time between 2010 and like 2013

275
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:14,679
but I didn't even swear on this channel. I didn't know what I wanted the channel to be.

276
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:20,659
I didn't know if I wanted the channel to be a channel where I did, I was a professional

277
00:47:20,659 --> 00:47:25,619
reviewer or something. This is like, nobody knew what the fuck they were doing back in like 2012.

278
00:47:26,179 --> 00:47:34,230
No one. Not one person did. And now there's fist formulas for all this shit now. It is where

279
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:40,309
everybody's at that everyone's got the perfect way to do everything now. 10 years ago it was like

280
00:47:40,309 --> 00:47:48,280
there are people watching my YouTube channel. Why? What do I do? Wait, what? There's how many

281
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:53,780
people, how many people clicked on that video? Why did they click on that video? Did I do more

282
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:59,739
of that? What should I do? Should I do like, should I do like another TF2 video? Should I do,

283
00:47:59,739 --> 00:48:05,659
I'm gonna do this grandpa video. I think. Yeah. I think that's what I'm gonna do. I hope. And then

284
00:48:05,659 --> 00:48:13,429
you make videos like that trying to like, it was different. It was, it was the wild west. It was

285
00:48:13,429 --> 00:48:18,710
the wild. I never did clickbait videos. No, I didn't. No fucking way. Not in a million years.

286
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:32,539
No, I did not. I refuse to believe that. When, when did I do a clickbait video? I never ever,

287
00:48:32,539 --> 00:48:44,500
ever did that. Ha ha. Oh God. Ha ha. Oh God is me not knowing what I want to title a video,

288
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:51,539
not clickbait. That's, I have no title for this. So it's going to be a TF2 uncensored

289
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:56,420
German. Ha ha. Oh God. I don't have any other words to describe the video. So I was going to

290
00:48:56,420 --> 00:49:10,019
write ha ha. Oh God. Give me a clickbait TF2, bring on the thunder. That's not clickbait. That

291
00:49:10,019 --> 00:49:18,500
happened. I got clickbaited in that video. Don't you understand the purpose of this video was I

292
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:36,360
was clickbaited. I was baited in this video and I was very upset by it. Watch it on stream. No,

293
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:44,230
no, I'm trying to hold on. Let me get through level one of find the hidden people. Somebody said,

294
00:49:44,309 --> 00:49:47,429
what about the video where you said this is the scariest game ever? I really thought it was.

295
00:49:47,429 --> 00:49:59,269
I really thought it was. It was the scariest game ever. And the reason why I thought it was

296
00:49:59,269 --> 00:50:07,190
the scariest game ever. Okay. If you were to go back to like the 1700s and you brought a DVD

297
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:14,329
of Adam Sandler's Jack and Jill, and you gave it and you brought a TV and you plugged it in

298
00:50:14,329 --> 00:50:17,849
somehow. You got it to work and you, and you watch, you showed like the pilgrims fucking

299
00:50:17,849 --> 00:50:22,139
Jack and Jill. That would be the, they would be like, holy fuck. This is the most insane,

300
00:50:22,139 --> 00:50:24,940
ridiculous thing I've ever seen in my life. This is the best, but it's just called a movie.

301
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:30,250
That's the best movie I've ever seen in my life because they have no, they didn't have any other

302
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:37,659
experiences watching any other movies. So I didn't play that many scary games. So that was

303
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:42,420
the scariest game I had played, but there was a million of the scary games that I hadn't played

304
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:51,380
yet. They had Shakespeare. It doesn't matter. I have a magical box that plays Adam Sandler on a

305
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:57,719
TV. This one is actually clickbait. No, it's not. I'll give you, I can explain all of them.

306
00:50:57,719 --> 00:51:20,889
What is it? I didn't, I didn't make this video. I didn't make this video. Games that you see in

307
00:51:20,889 --> 00:51:31,500
this chat. I'm just going to get it off with because, wait, hold on. Wait, everybody, everybody

308
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:38,460
settle down for a second. I got to get this. Okay. Hold on. I can rebuttal this. I really can.

309
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:55,079
You give me any of these, I'll rebuttal them. This is painful. I bet I can't load anything.

310
00:51:55,079 --> 00:51:59,000
You used to switch to Boost Mobile. You get four free phones when you switch. Switch to Boost Mobile

311
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,239
and get four lines for $25 per line per month with unlimited data and four free Samsung Galaxy A20

312
00:52:03,239 --> 00:52:07,800

313
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:15,099
most requested games that you see in this chat. I'm just going to get it off with because

314
00:52:16,619 --> 00:52:23,099
it's all everybody talks about before every stream. It's based on a bunch of fucking animated

315
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:29,179
characters, like your fucking anime bullshit that everybody seems to like these days. Animated

316
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:43,139
character. Can't wait. We're just going to get it over with real quick. Of course I'm talking

317
00:52:43,139 --> 00:52:50,579
about Garfield car. How's that clickbait? That's just me. Let's do it. I'll get you and I'll look

318
00:52:50,579 --> 00:53:00,409
like a bloody accident. How about this? If I don't win this race, then, okay, if I don't win

319
00:53:00,489 --> 00:53:09,880
this race, come in first place, then I will, I will beat Doki Doki Literature Club on stream

320
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:17,239
10 times in a row. Holy fuck. When did that? Why did I do that? All right. Focus now. Okay.

321
00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:26,179
If I do not find the rabbit within the next 10 minutes, I will beat Doki Doki Literature Club

322
00:53:26,179 --> 00:53:39,300
on stream 10 times in a row.

323
00:54:32,659 --> 00:54:33,619
That's wheat, right?

324
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:07,219
Why didn't I say the mushroom? Why didn't I say the mushroom?

325
00:55:33,269 --> 00:55:46,809
Get the fuck out of here. Don't have to do it. Three winks. Did it.

326
00:55:49,690 --> 00:55:51,530
Fortress Raphael dries in the sun.

327
00:55:56,489 --> 00:56:00,170
You have a Snapchat filter on. You don't want to show. Okay.

328
00:56:01,210 --> 00:56:06,889
Jerma, Jerma, you got a Snapchat filter on. That's why you look so good today. Fine. We'll turn,

329
00:56:06,889 --> 00:56:17,260
we'll turn, we'll get it on all the defaults. You ready? Fine. You want to see? I'll turn off

330
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:28,440
all the filters. All right. That's the, that's the smoother I turned off because I had kind of a

331
00:56:28,519 --> 00:56:39,480
glossy look today. Turn off this one. I had a, I had a lip reducer that was on too.

332
00:56:41,719 --> 00:56:58,550
Had a shine removal and there was a gloss there over there. Okay.

333
00:57:00,809 --> 00:57:12,809
The what? Do I look any different? Oh, actually kind of a little bit. It's not even that much.

334
00:57:15,369 --> 00:57:17,610
It's not that much. Turn them all back on.

335
00:57:30,179 --> 00:57:53,139
That's better. That link, what? Stop doing that with your head.

336
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:03,300
So I stopped doing, stop doing the like, I need to be, I need to, I want to tilt my head in every

337
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:13,929
photo. That's what people, that's what people do. Hold on, hold on. We can't even get through

338
00:58:13,929 --> 00:58:26,920
one level of this game guys. What is this? Why do I have this? Why is this saved? Why is this saved

339
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:51,480
in OBS? Why is this in OBS? What is this image called? This is just in OBS. That's actually a

340
00:58:51,480 --> 00:59:10,519
scary image. I don't know, you know how you did that that fast. Guys, that's, that was like 42

341
00:59:10,519 --> 00:59:19,429
seconds. How the fuck did you do that? Do you guys just have Photoshop ready and you just,

342
00:59:19,429 --> 00:59:27,340
I don't even, how do you even do it that fast? All right, where's, I gotta find this person.

343
00:59:29,909 --> 00:59:48,150
Oh, by the way, hey, listen up. All right, this is important. Listen. No, you gotta do,

344
00:59:48,150 --> 01:00:16,309
you gotta do the side one, the side one. Hey, listen to me. I'm trying, hey, listen.

345
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:23,320
It's Kim and I's anniversary tonight. What do you think about that?

346
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:46,949
Four years. Long time. What am I doing here? I said tonight, tonight, we got plans. We got plans,

347
01:00:46,949 --> 01:00:53,510
me and her. I'm streaming. No, no, I'm streaming right now, but we got plans tonight and tomorrow.

348
01:00:57,429 --> 01:01:08,519
I gotta find Ivan. That's why you shaved. This dude leaves his girlfriend for big bits.

349
01:01:10,179 --> 01:01:17,079
Oh, why did I say that out loud? No, just forget it. Where's Ivan?

350
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:33,530
Yeah. Okay. I'm kind of, I kind of can't stand these noises anymore. How do you guys watch this

351
01:01:33,530 --> 01:01:39,670
stream? It's taking me an hour and two minutes to be like, nah, I don't want to hear these noises

352
01:01:39,670 --> 01:01:56,699
ever again. We don't. All right. There's no, he's not down here. He's right here. Probably.

353
01:02:04,570 --> 01:02:05,369
Bathroom doors.

354
01:02:05,530 --> 01:02:18,170
All right. I have no idea what this guy is. There's only, the cars, they're only here.

355
01:02:19,929 --> 01:02:33,769
He's a stowaway. He gets to ride without permission. That's not him. And he can't escape.

356
01:02:49,719 --> 01:02:52,039
Oh, shit. Wait.

357
01:02:52,039 --> 01:03:01,659
Wait. Where the hell is he? Well, that's a tortoise, right?

358
01:03:12,329 --> 01:03:19,619
All right. Let's go. Why it takes his job as a wheat supervisor very seriously.

359
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:27,219
I bet you German never even kissed anyone before.

360
01:03:33,159 --> 01:03:54,199
Hitchfork. Hitchfork. Hitchfork. Hitchfork. Hitchfork. Hitchfork. Hitchfork versus hay.

361
01:03:54,199 --> 01:04:06,679
Where's the fucking hay? Wouldn't it be right here? Hitchfork. Hitchfork versus hay.

362
01:04:18,809 --> 01:04:35,099
Hitchfork. Hitchfork. Hitchfork. Hitchfork. Hitchfork. Hitchfork. Hitchfork. Hitchfork.

363
01:04:45,019 --> 01:04:47,099
This picture makes me laugh every time.

364
01:04:50,460 --> 01:05:04,889
That's like the ultimate narcissist photo.

365
01:05:08,969 --> 01:05:14,409
Yeah, it is. Imagine if you were that, like, follow yourself that only you...

366
01:05:18,599 --> 01:05:24,599
This can't be even real. Make this the thumbnail. I'm not going to make this the thumbnail of the

367
01:05:24,679 --> 01:05:34,780
stream. So you want me to sit here like this for like two straight minutes to make sure this is

368
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:57,579
the thumbnail on the stream. No! Did it already happen? No, it didn't already happen. Stop blinking

369
01:05:57,579 --> 01:06:20,489
me that weird picture of my face. That's top tier clickbait. I can play. I'm sexually attracted to

370
01:06:20,489 --> 01:06:27,500
me. If you water your crops well and give them a little bit of extra attention, you may see this

371
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:43,880
flower. Got it. All right, ForresterAman is as much an artist as he is a lumberjack.

372
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:57,239
All right, he's an artist. Artist, artist, artist, artist, artist. What are you doing?

373
01:06:57,239 --> 01:07:04,329
It's another one of those streams, huh? It's another one of those... Here comes

374
01:07:04,329 --> 01:07:25,449
an image every three minutes. It's one of those. Yeah, that's not even turned the right way.

375
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:59,340
Oh! Oh! Oh! What is this? What the fuck is this? Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, that's the New Year's kiss.

376
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:11,639
Here's the thing, though. Okay, everybody looks like that when they kiss somebody.

377
01:08:11,639 --> 01:08:19,640
You ever... Here's a little tip to make yourself... Take your iPhone and put it

378
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:26,520
right up to your fucking face and close your eyes and go like that and tell me what it looks like.

379
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:34,899
Go like this. Go like this. Take your phone. Go like this. You're going to look like that.

380
01:08:35,460 --> 01:09:32,310
I'll do it right now. Okay, here we go. Ready? You see? Okay, so exhibit A. I rest my case.

381
01:09:57,109 --> 01:10:04,760
Who cares about the fucking pizza guys? He's avoiding playing this. No, I'm not.

382
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:18,260
I can't even. Guys, there's too many pictures you have here. You have too many photos.

383
01:10:24,550 --> 01:10:31,350
Oh god. It looks like I'm made out of clay. Oh, all right. All right. All right. Okay. All right.

384
01:10:31,350 --> 01:10:40,550
It's time. It's time. It's time. It's time to go. It's time to go. It's time to play. I'm playing.

385
01:10:40,550 --> 01:10:45,350
It's time to play the game. That's the thumbnail now. Okay, that's fine. It's all right. It's time

386
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:58,500
to go. Show us. Hold on. I don't even know what image it is. Not this one. It's not that one.

387
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:03,100
Where is it? And just like the crowd in the background making all these fucked up noises.

388
01:11:03,659 --> 01:11:21,770
You guys ever fucking think that like Intel is going to approach me for anything?

389
01:11:22,859 --> 01:11:30,979
No, not this one. Not this guy. What? The title is perfect. Oh, all right. All right.

390
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:44,460
All right. Artist and a lumberjack. It's time to tell your girlfriend you love her.

391
01:11:46,329 --> 01:12:01,819
I just found a chicken. Yeah, I've now. Oh, there's a cow. Wait. Oh, that's not you.

392
01:12:02,859 --> 01:12:10,739
I want coffee right now. What can I get coffee quick right now? All right. I'm going to go. I'm

393
01:12:10,739 --> 01:15:32,229
going to get coffee quick right now. All right. Anybody find this? Anybody find this person?

394
01:15:35,239 --> 01:15:38,680
You lost viewers. What the fuck? No, are you fucking kidding me?

395
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:49,239
How many? How many? How many? No, what the fuck? 100, 200, 300, 500 got stupid. Oh,

396
01:15:49,239 --> 01:15:54,010
I've never taken another break ever again. All right. Where's uh, where's this person?

397
01:15:54,649 --> 01:16:12,119
We're going to find the art artist artist. It's right there, dude. Hold on. He's a lumberjack.

398
01:16:12,199 --> 01:16:24,060
He's an artist. We got a wink. I'm, I'm getting really tired of doing that.

399
01:16:27,050 --> 01:16:32,340
I didn't think I didn't think it was going to take. Um, I don't think I thought it was going

400
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:39,460
to be way longer. People have to get to 75,000. I'm done. I'm tired with the links, but they can't,

401
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:47,420
I can't move them. I can't leave. I have to stay. It's like in two months. Oh, right. That's

402
01:16:47,420 --> 01:16:53,130
you're right. It's been a while. Okay. Who is this guy? It's time to get some fruity physics

403
01:16:53,130 --> 01:16:59,000
into Newton's head. All right. Here it is. I didn't even take me one second.

404
01:17:02,140 --> 01:17:04,300
Okay. Anymore apple to drop on somebody's head.

405
01:17:07,899 --> 01:17:11,180
Apple, apple. There it is.

406
01:17:11,180 --> 01:17:40,220
This is interesting. Did the Joker laugh? Why did the Joker laugh right now? How appropriate

407
01:17:40,220 --> 01:17:50,489
would a Joker laugh be right now? We already, we just talked about this.

408
01:17:51,210 --> 01:17:52,569
We just talked about this.

409
01:17:56,460 --> 01:18:06,539
Scarecrow. Oh, here we go. Where is this? Fake Bull Barney is not moved by this pen. Maybe

410
01:18:06,539 --> 01:18:10,659
because he's fake and has no feelings. Fake Bull Barney.

411
01:18:12,970 --> 01:18:17,399
Yes. Fake Bull Barney. Five minutes on the clock.

412
01:18:21,289 --> 01:18:24,489
Needle might not be in a haystack, but she sure knows how to roll.

413
01:18:27,609 --> 01:18:33,189
Clues. Cool clues. What? No.

414
01:18:49,590 --> 01:18:56,789
There you go. Oh, I did it. Oh, let's stay here for now. Okay. We have another image

415
01:18:56,789 --> 01:19:28,600
that's circulating. Okay. What's wrong with you guys? What is wrong with you guys?

416
01:19:29,239 --> 01:19:56,579
Why did you do this? Why would you make this? Okay. No.

417
01:20:03,909 --> 01:20:13,189
It's like, it's the fact that it's come out of the coat. He's like five, five. He's like five, six.

418
01:20:14,390 --> 01:20:17,909
Why is it like a person? What are you doing?

419
01:20:18,470 --> 01:20:36,649
Okay. No. Community crack night. No, it is kind of. I hope to God that's not the thumbnail because

420
01:20:36,649 --> 01:20:42,489
that would be really fucked up. No, I've been doing too much fucked up shit on the screen.

421
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:49,060
All right. Too many. All right. We got to dial back the fucked up stuff.

422
01:20:49,699 --> 01:21:02,260
Okay. Oh, look. It's me as the Joker. It's full moon. It's just constant images.

423
01:21:02,979 --> 01:21:08,119
I did. I said it was going to be crazy and I should, I do. I shouldn't have said that.

424
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:21,340
I should have said it was going to be chill. Constant conflict. No, I saw that one. It's not

425
01:21:21,340 --> 01:21:30,970
the thumbnail. All right. Where's this fish? This rotting fish is repelling potential customers.

426
01:21:35,180 --> 01:21:36,619
Well, here's the market down here.

427
01:21:47,000 --> 01:22:00,119
Come on. Where is it? Here's the fish. That's be close, right?

428
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:10,119
Drawing away potential colors like a trash can somewhere. It's rotting fish.

429
01:22:50,979 --> 01:23:07,510
Okay. Good. All right. I got to turn. I got to mute. Where's this fish?

430
01:23:24,779 --> 01:23:32,420
Which staff and scrolling by that thumbnail be like, I got to click on this one.

431
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:54,100
Where's this fish? The hell is this? It's right here somewhere. It has to be.

432
01:23:54,739 --> 01:24:24,060
Where is it? Shit. Is there another market scaring off potential customers? Oh, wait.

433
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:35,130
What's going on down here? There's only two. There's a scarecrow in this fish and then needle.

434
01:24:35,130 --> 01:24:39,619
Oh, got you. No, shit. Really? There you are.

435
01:24:41,779 --> 01:24:56,819
Staff is here. Everybody, quick. Duck. I keep passing the fish.

436
01:25:05,529 --> 01:25:14,939
Well, I found that. That's good. No, don't scatter. No, no, no, no, no. Just everybody.

437
01:25:16,489 --> 01:25:22,010
I'm having a family reunion party. We're all family here. Your brothers, sisters,

438
01:25:22,010 --> 01:25:25,289
your cousins, your relatives. This is like thousands of us. We do it every year.

439
01:25:25,289 --> 01:25:35,689
Shit. Stop. Stop. Shut up. All right. Fuck it. I'm going to the next one.

440
01:25:35,689 --> 01:25:41,100
Fabian wants to get back to the festival, but the signs aren't helping him.

441
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:45,590
Oh, God. Oh, this is not going to be good.

442
01:25:46,729 --> 01:26:09,100
Oh, shit. This is look at how huge this is. Oh, this is so big. New here. Is this the Twitch?

443
01:26:09,100 --> 01:26:15,420
Okay. Well, the signs aren't helping. Found him. Got you. Fabian. I got you.

444
01:26:15,979 --> 01:26:35,369
What are you guys doing? Dude, you know, the thing, you know,

445
01:26:35,369 --> 01:26:40,760
if you ever heard like the phrase, like, don't ever post anything on the internet.

446
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:49,239
You ever heard that before? So I had like a cute moment with my girlfriend.

447
01:26:49,239 --> 01:27:00,619
And it's been it's been ruined forever. I don't have a post anything on the internet,

448
01:27:00,619 --> 01:27:07,380
but let this be a real lesson for you. What you see on the screen right now should be a warning.

449
01:27:07,380 --> 01:27:13,739
Don't tell anybody fucking who you are. Don't give him any photos. Don't send anybody a picture.

450
01:27:13,739 --> 01:27:18,220
Don't ever take a picture. Never take a picture ever again, unless it's on a disposable camera

451
01:27:18,220 --> 01:27:20,699
and you have the originals. You have the negatives.

452
01:27:20,939 --> 01:27:43,770
Oh, why? There's so many of these. I wanted to see him kiss the dog again from staff.

453
01:27:54,699 --> 01:28:03,979
Okay. It's real, by the way. Oh, that's fucking funny. Is it bait? Yeah. No, this is a test.

454
01:28:04,539 --> 01:28:17,899
Now this is a test. I don't want to fail the test. Like, oh, I want to see him kiss the dog again.

455
01:28:17,899 --> 01:28:22,380
He's got his finger hovering over the 72 hour suspension.

456
01:28:27,859 --> 01:28:39,420
The chief was standing up a minute ago. Standing up a minute ago. So what does that mean? Standing

457
01:28:39,420 --> 01:29:12,439
up a minute ago? Is it flying down? The axe in that one. Oh, you guys really. Why are we airing?

458
01:29:12,439 --> 01:29:16,760
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Why are we airing all? Why are we airing all the grievances of this stream?

459
01:29:17,399 --> 01:29:20,520
Why are you guys trying to get me to get like in trouble? You guys are just.

460
01:29:21,239 --> 01:29:29,050
Why are you gaslighting Twitch staff into making me like investigate me? Why? What are you doing?

461
01:29:38,699 --> 01:29:43,100
Hey, dude, I took two weeks ago. Check the timestamp here. Check that out.

462
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:51,449
That serves you right. You're playing hidden folks on board. Hey, you're going to get what?

463
01:29:51,449 --> 01:30:10,899
You're going to find anything. Hey, don't don't let this chat gaslight you staff.

464
01:30:10,899 --> 01:30:20,600
What is it? It's fucking lit. Lit Fortnite arms and arms up and down, leaning forward and back.

465
01:30:22,470 --> 01:30:27,909
What? OK, so you're pulling a log of what everything I told you guys. What did I fucking tell you?

466
01:30:28,630 --> 01:30:34,149
What did I tell you? I specifically made this use this as an example. Don't ever everything

467
01:30:34,149 --> 01:30:39,689
you've ever written on this website is logged. All of it. Every single thing you've ever said

468
01:30:39,689 --> 01:30:51,670
is tied to you. Somebody just pulled that back. That was like four months ago. It's all here.

469
01:30:51,670 --> 01:30:59,670
Let me be the example for you. Everyone wasn't enough to for scavenger fury max. Wait,

470
01:30:59,670 --> 01:31:02,390
the sombrero cactus resides somewhere on the outskirts of the desert.

471
01:31:02,949 --> 01:31:21,670
Who's this? Oh, wait, something going on out here. Help.

472
01:31:22,069 --> 01:31:43,130
Meet me. Do we help them? What the fuck? It's fucking two hours until this joker's

473
01:31:43,130 --> 01:31:52,409
dreams. P.S. team all this piss and shit time. Grow up. No, guys, that was that was me quoting

474
01:31:52,409 --> 01:31:58,409
someone. I didn't say that. That was me saying, hey, look at what this crazy person wrote.

475
01:31:59,850 --> 01:32:13,670
I didn't say that. I'm not crazy. Not me. Not me. I'm normal. I'm very normal.

476
01:32:13,670 --> 01:32:17,560
I mean, I'm exceptionally normal. I'll prove it to you right now.

477
01:32:23,029 --> 01:32:32,779
Hello. How are you? I'm doing very well. You see the Red Sox last night?

478
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:51,130
Yeah, they did a very good job. I can't believe they're trading for Ronson Arroyo. Also, I my

479
01:32:51,130 --> 01:32:59,539
anniversary tonight with my girlfriend should be really fun. I'm gonna go out and maybe

480
01:32:59,539 --> 01:33:09,130
to dinner. I will, you know, I do very normal things with me and my girlfriend. We just go do

481
01:33:09,130 --> 01:33:18,010
things. I'll be wearing a suit with a bathing suit underneath just in case. You never know

482
01:33:18,010 --> 01:33:22,569
when you're going to get invited to go to a pool or go into water. You got to be ready.

483
01:33:28,279 --> 01:33:35,100
Did Twitch staff just give a hundred community subs? Did Link, the Twitch staffer, oops,

484
01:33:35,100 --> 01:33:58,020
misclick? Holy shit. Wow. That's a lot of fucking subs. Link, what are you doing? That's insane.

485
01:34:07,529 --> 01:34:15,720
Link gaming. Dude, Link gaming? No, thank you. Thank you for the hundred community subs,

486
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:23,350
which I will take as a free pass to have dog kiss images on my stream. All right, good.

487
01:34:29,819 --> 01:34:41,140
Free pass granted. No, thank you. Seriously. That's a ton of money. All our hopes are for

488
01:34:41,140 --> 01:34:54,890
this one plant to grow here in the desert. Don't drown it. I failed the test. Oh, dog kiss pass.

489
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:05,960
This lone vulture ate literally everything around him. Everything. Is this a vulture or

490
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:30,279
is this every Justin Roiland character? What's going on down here? Wow, funny stuff, dude.

491
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:42,840
So where is it? I will tell you that Justin Roiland is so good at doing a loud, high-pitched

492
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:50,739
scream. No one will ever be able to do that. No one will ever be able to do that. Like I can't,

493
01:35:50,739 --> 01:35:54,500
no one can do it. Only he can. No one else can ever do that ever to ever live.

494
01:35:58,100 --> 01:36:06,149
I can't even try it because it'll be embarrassing because I wouldn't, it wouldn't even be close.

495
01:36:06,149 --> 01:36:22,859
SOS. The trail ends here. Aladdin surfs the mild winds across the desert like nothing weird is

496
01:36:22,859 --> 01:36:38,520
happening. Let me send help. Oh, shit. I found you. This is Eric. That would have been so hard to

497
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:51,699
find that. Hurry, Max. Glasses. It was the, I'm right here. I can help you. It was only the

498
01:36:51,699 --> 01:37:02,310
woman's glasses the three vultures didn't eat. All right, I got to find, hold on. I need my help.

499
01:37:02,310 --> 01:37:11,930
I'm trapped in my bathroom. Start at the beginning of your bathroom and do a false sprint and then

500
01:37:11,930 --> 01:37:29,220
put shoulder into door. Don't do that. What do you want me to say? Do you have access to a phone?

501
01:37:29,220 --> 01:37:37,289
No? Can you not like slip like a, like something in the lock on your side to open it? Is the door

502
01:37:37,289 --> 01:37:44,180
completely lodged? You have no access to anything. Do you have a window in that room? You don't have

503
01:37:44,180 --> 01:37:50,010
access to the window. There's no window. All right, well, that's weird, okay? So how are you

504
01:37:50,010 --> 01:37:54,020
going to get out of it? You're going to do that? What do you want me to tell you? Lie on your back.

505
01:37:54,020 --> 01:37:58,279
If you're in a scenario where you're stuck, it's trapped and you can't get out and there's literally

506
01:37:58,279 --> 01:38:02,939
no one to help you. Lie on your back and put your knees at a 90 degree angle at the door and just

507
01:38:02,939 --> 01:38:09,159
like infant toddler tantrum, one, two, three, five, five, sit with both heels into the door until it

508
01:38:09,159 --> 01:38:14,619
opens. What do you want me to tell you? Why are you asking me for this advice? What do you want me to

509
01:38:14,619 --> 01:38:37,539
tell you? Is your door made out of wood? Probably. Mega Man Legends 2 looks great. Yeah, that's,

510
01:38:37,539 --> 01:38:45,449
that boat sailed like an hour ago. I do, I will prove that I own it though. Here it is. I will

511
01:38:45,449 --> 01:39:05,060
prove, I will prove that I own it. That's the Lord of the Rings. I'll prove that I own it. That's

512
01:39:05,060 --> 01:39:13,140
like the serial number. Wait, what's this? Oh, there's like a Capcom hint telephone number.

513
01:39:13,140 --> 01:39:25,100
He's got Lego hair. No, I do not. Not today. Bullshit. Bullshit. Do I? No, I don't actually.

514
01:39:25,100 --> 01:39:32,760
This is normal human hair. Normal human hair today. This is hair. This is just human hair.

515
01:39:32,760 --> 01:39:45,579
Now I've, I've made it Lego hair. This is what a normal person looks like. I, this is what a

516
01:39:45,579 --> 01:39:50,199
normal person looks like. If you saw me on the train. All right. If you saw me on the train,

517
01:39:50,199 --> 01:39:53,720
if we were on the fucking train together and you saw me like this, what would, you wouldn't do

518
01:39:53,720 --> 01:40:08,119
anything. Yeah. That's a normal person. He's doing an alien monologue. This must be the

519
01:40:08,119 --> 01:40:12,760
right Oasis treasure hunter. Open sesame, open sesame, open. Nope. This rocky door needs a

520
01:40:12,760 --> 01:40:23,210
different kind of magic. I'm going to start wearing like a mustache. I can't grow a mustache.

521
01:40:23,210 --> 01:40:27,800
So I'm going to start wearing like a fake mustache. All right. We're going to find this.

522
01:40:28,600 --> 01:40:35,399
We're going to find the vultures. Vultures, vultures, vultures. If I saw you on a train,

523
01:40:35,399 --> 01:40:38,939
I'd say is that Jerma from JermaCraft? You would not do that.

524
01:40:50,329 --> 01:41:01,350
It's chats full of vultures. I didn't say that. You did. Would you cringe if someone actually did

525
01:41:01,350 --> 01:41:09,989
that to you? No, I wouldn't. I would laugh. I'd be like, Oh, that's funny. And then I would get

526
01:41:09,989 --> 01:41:13,430
off at the next stop. Even if I didn't have to get off at that stop, even if it meant I'd gotten a

527
01:41:13,430 --> 01:41:33,720
taxi cab for 30 minutes to go to where I was going. What is this? This has been a fun stream.

528
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:37,640
This has been like the chat takes over the stream and I kind of, I'm all right with it. I think

529
01:41:37,640 --> 01:41:53,659
it's fun. It's Lego hair again. That's all right. What? Dead people. This has been a downward

530
01:41:53,659 --> 01:42:03,029
spiral. I don't think so. I think this has been an upward spiral. Wait, open sesame.

531
01:42:05,850 --> 01:42:18,390
Martin waits for the music to kick in, but he will dance primarily on the inside.

532
01:42:18,390 --> 01:42:26,869
No. What about these animals? This bottle of water could save your life in the dunes of the desert.

533
01:42:26,869 --> 01:42:32,329
Bottle of water. I got to focus on one thing at a time here.

534
01:42:32,329 --> 01:42:47,289
The chainsaw. This is my first stream of yours. Could you kindly explain what's going on?

535
01:42:51,609 --> 01:42:54,819
Well, first of all, welcome to the stream. Thanks for joining us.

536
01:42:57,350 --> 01:43:01,180
This is a game. It's a hidden object game where you have to find, it's like a where's Waldo hidden

537
01:43:01,180 --> 01:43:11,989
object game. The whole purpose is to find these things. Like for instance, the vulture. That's

538
01:43:11,989 --> 01:43:16,970
fine. It's just a fun little game. We're just hanging out and just talking about stuff and

539
01:43:19,479 --> 01:44:06,229
I need to find a bottle of water. All right. Where's this bottle of water? Looking for water.

540
01:44:06,229 --> 01:44:14,699
Looking for a group of vultures too. What's with the rocks? This is weird rock formation.

541
01:44:14,699 --> 01:44:22,840
You look like someone hit random in a creative character. Oh, that's a crock of absolute

542
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:40,310
bullshit. That's not even remotely accurate. All right. There are many things that I am,

543
01:44:40,310 --> 01:44:46,810
but one thing I am not is you look like someone hit random on a character creator.

544
01:44:46,890 --> 01:44:54,100
I am no for a fact that I am not those things. I might not be able to do basic children's math.

545
01:44:54,100 --> 01:45:18,810
I know that and I've told you that. Mr. Bone, come on. What about down here?

546
01:45:18,810 --> 01:45:42,409
Too many places to be. Mail preset number three. Oh, please. Fuck. I'm never going to find this

547
01:45:42,409 --> 01:45:56,680
shit. Who am I looking for? Looking for who you? I'm missing the music. Aladdin searched the mild

548
01:45:56,680 --> 01:46:13,829
winds across the desert. Hey, no, no, he's right there. Where? What? What? Oh,

549
01:46:20,739 --> 01:46:24,739
look, I can't see where you're pointing, guys. How many times do I have to tell you the title?

550
01:46:34,390 --> 01:46:35,829
Says he likes to go be inside.

551
01:46:45,270 --> 01:46:56,760
Martin. No, he's not here. He's not even over here. That person is.

552
01:47:01,689 --> 01:47:03,850
All right, let's go. We need to find where people are dancing.

553
01:47:06,149 --> 01:47:11,539
Ladies and gentlemen, that's not what I need. Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen,

554
01:47:11,539 --> 01:47:15,689
let me tell you, ladies and gentlemen, how do you guys like to be referred to?

555
01:47:16,949 --> 01:47:26,520
Ladies and gentlemen. Hey, you guys. Hey, chat. What would you prefer? Folks. Hey, folks.

556
01:47:39,579 --> 01:47:44,060
The germs, the germaniacs. No, that's not what this that's not what you guys are called.

557
01:47:46,470 --> 01:47:49,029
We have gone over this many times. You guys are the germamites.

558
01:47:49,670 --> 01:48:07,140
Anybody see water? No, not the rats. You are the germamite, the germamites. Yeah,

559
01:48:07,140 --> 01:48:12,100
to say it like that. Otherwise, it's not accurate. It's the the accent there.

560
01:48:16,779 --> 01:48:22,300
No links resident sleeper. Are you sure? That's I see a lot of them. Oh, here we go. What's down

561
01:48:22,300 --> 01:48:39,369
here? Martin waits for the music. Martin waits for the music. Martin looking for the music.

562
01:48:39,369 --> 01:49:12,489
Martin music. Wait, yeah. Oh, Rick. Oh, Rick. What? What? We made that reference before. I wasn't.

563
01:49:14,250 --> 01:49:17,369
That's the original image. Why are you linking the original image?

564
01:49:17,369 --> 01:49:24,420
Instant minus two for saying Rick. I wouldn't even I wouldn't even do an impression.

565
01:49:24,420 --> 01:49:30,899
Instant instant just reaction when they Rick and Morty down vote. I didn't do anything. OK,

566
01:49:31,060 --> 01:49:38,659
I'm doing it again. I've said it again. I got to stop saying the word that show. What? What? Why

567
01:49:38,659 --> 01:49:47,270
are we so fucking crazy about that show? It's like it's ear poison. If you hear that word.

568
01:49:47,270 --> 01:50:01,880
Why? It's all right. It's I mean, whatever you do. You guys don't care that much, do you? Yes,

569
01:50:01,880 --> 01:50:10,340
we do. What's your favorite TV show? What's your favorite TV show? Current TV show that's currently

570
01:50:10,340 --> 01:50:24,859
on the air. Fear factor. That's not even on the air. The NBA. I mean, that's called the NBA school.

571
01:50:24,859 --> 01:50:40,250
Roe Jack Horseman. OK. Better Call Saul. It's a good one. Power Rangers.

572
01:50:40,250 --> 01:50:47,079
America's Funniest Home Videos. Always Sunny Philadelphia. That's a great one. Here we go.

573
01:50:47,079 --> 01:50:53,979
We made it to the festival. How come I'm not? I am disgusted. I am absolutely revolted that I'm not

574
01:50:53,979 --> 01:50:59,619
seeing any Curb Your Enthusiasm fans here. I'm disgusted by this. I'm fucking actually disgusted.

575
01:50:59,619 --> 01:51:17,779
I think one person said it. Curb is for boomers. Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I'm revolted right

576
01:51:17,779 --> 01:51:25,909
now. I got to go brush my teeth after hearing that. OK, we need to find the person that

577
01:51:26,390 --> 01:51:48,840
music only likes to dance inside dancing inside. Where are you? Oh, oh, I turned the music on.

578
01:51:52,380 --> 01:51:54,939
All right. Everybody dance. There's there's the only dances on the inside.

579
01:51:56,859 --> 01:52:09,699
How many more do I need to move? One more. And it's one of these hard ones.

580
01:52:10,500 --> 01:52:19,399
This reptile is a narcissist. What's this image? Narcissist, narcissist, narcissist, narcissist,

581
01:52:19,399 --> 01:52:28,149
narcissist. This one's good. I like this one. I'll show this one. This one's actually really

582
01:52:28,149 --> 01:52:37,829
this one's this one's pretty good. It is. Can you imagine like walking into the bathroom and seeing

583
01:52:37,829 --> 01:53:07,590
this public restroom album cover? He's an egomaniac. This reptile is in this cactus

584
01:53:07,590 --> 01:53:13,109
forest is so well camouflaged often loses itself. It's extremely rare. Whiteback scorpion is

585
01:53:13,109 --> 01:53:20,119
surrounded by its children. A king of the desert never goes underground. All right. King of the

586
01:53:20,119 --> 01:53:33,020
desert never goes underground. Well, I found the snake. How is that not the snake looking for a

587
01:53:33,020 --> 01:53:53,420
bunch of scorpions? There are no more people left. Scorpions, tons of them. We want face cam. Oh,

588
01:53:53,420 --> 01:54:12,979
OK. Thanks for the feedback. Appreciate the feedback. Scammed out of a wink. Let me just make

589
01:54:12,979 --> 01:54:26,310
sure. Oh, fuck. Yeah, I did scam you. Hold on. All right. I need either a snake or I need the

590
01:54:26,310 --> 01:54:36,310
scorpions or a bottle of water or a reptile in a cactus place. Bottle of water, cactus forest,

591
01:54:42,630 --> 01:54:52,100
cactus forest, cactus forest, cactus forest. No, what a handsome young man I am. Hey, thanks.

592
01:54:58,260 --> 01:55:06,920
I don't even know what this is. What is this image? This is like a bunch of dots, like three

593
01:55:06,920 --> 01:55:16,380
mapping of me. I don't know what that is. I don't want to. Why does every one of your winks look

594
01:55:16,380 --> 01:55:23,960
like you're trying to get something out of your eye? Because I am trying to get something out of

595
01:55:23,960 --> 01:55:34,460
my eye. I'm trying to get a wink over with so I can go back to doing a live stream. Remember,

596
01:55:34,460 --> 01:55:45,300
those are codes. He hates us. No, I already told you how I feel about the winks now because I

597
01:55:45,300 --> 01:55:56,420
thought it was funny for one day and it's been two months and I have to stay. I can't walk it back.

598
01:55:56,420 --> 01:56:01,659
I'm not going to walk it back. I never said I was going to walk it back. Increase the wink

599
01:56:01,659 --> 01:56:14,970
price. No, no, no, I can't. It's too late. Come on, where are these scorpions? I need to find one

600
01:56:14,970 --> 01:56:34,779
more damn thing. Would you be mad if I made winks 200,000? But I kept 75,000 and 75,000 was

601
01:56:36,729 --> 01:56:53,510
my channel points. I say shpee. No, I don't want to do that. That's worse than winking.

602
01:56:55,289 --> 01:57:00,489
Imagine how often I would be doing that. You guys watch a lot and there's people that have a lot of

603
01:57:00,489 --> 01:57:13,529
points. I didn't even think about it. Oh, wait, I got it. Mom's waiting for the bus to the big

604
01:57:13,529 --> 01:57:24,569
city to buy some diapers. Yes, mom. Okay, the TV technician is fine tuning a signal.

605
01:57:31,750 --> 01:57:39,850
TV, TV tech, TV tech. There you are. Move it out of the way, please.

606
01:57:40,489 --> 01:57:53,109
Hello. Where's my wink? Well, you know what I'm going to do? I know it's 7,000 IQ play here.

607
01:57:53,109 --> 01:58:06,020
Soon, winks are going to be 75% off for one day only. And then it's going away.

608
01:58:16,699 --> 01:58:35,300
Is he on B? I'll cover fire for you. I got a few hits on him. He's dead. One more to the right.

609
01:58:35,300 --> 01:58:51,340
To the right. Yep. Got him. You're clear to go up. Go up. I got you. There's an old person's

610
01:58:51,340 --> 01:59:00,180
bone in some wall. Freaky stuff. Let's go. Winks are going to crash. You need to sell them now.

611
01:59:00,180 --> 01:59:07,899
Please don't. No, your wink. Don't you understand? Your winks are worth a lot now and you're selling

612
01:59:07,899 --> 01:59:19,350
them because you know that winks are going to be really, really inexpensive in like a month.

613
01:59:19,350 --> 01:59:28,869
That's insider wink trading. Oh man. Why did I just fucking say that? That was, why did I say this?

614
01:59:28,869 --> 01:59:37,609
Oh man. All right, what we got? For move or buck, this job was one box too many.

615
01:59:37,609 --> 01:59:54,390
Looking for a moving company. Moving company right here. Follow them. What happened up here?

616
01:59:54,390 --> 02:00:06,949
Whoa. Whoa. Why? What? What's going on up here? What happened? Why is it up red? I didn't fucking

617
02:00:06,949 --> 02:00:16,789
zip development going on up there. I hate that. Don't you hate it when you know you just got zip

618
02:00:16,789 --> 02:00:26,699
development. There's a whole block on the street forehead and you just know and it's here it comes

619
02:00:26,699 --> 02:00:34,170
and there's this four or five zits moving in. It's the worst. All right, where's this moving company?

620
02:00:37,590 --> 02:00:49,100
What's the other ones? Swimmer Sven got the address right, but the pool wrong. Peter Griffin.

02:00:49,819 --> 02:01:09,029
Oh, Lois. No, I don't think that's another one. That instantly is just like that. He said family

622
02:01:09,029 --> 02:01:31,340

623
02:01:31,340 --> 02:01:39,210
and 20 lollipops wasn't the right recipe for lemonade, limo. Charlie's yard sale is a big

624
02:01:39,210 --> 02:01:59,619
success, but where is the salesman himself? There's the lemonade, limo. My favorite voice so far.

625
02:02:07,220 --> 02:02:13,210
That's every Casio keyboard that has the weird human voice. Every time you went into the stores

626
02:02:13,210 --> 02:02:16,569
that just had the keyboards and you just put it on the voice one and just start pressing buttons
