00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:59,909
It's a massacre. What the hell's going on? Oh my God. All right. We went the wrong way.

25
00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:03,860
We're going to turn around. There was an off ramp we didn't take.

00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:34,470
You're orange.

30
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:38,949
Like I didn't realize the guns are so strong and it looks like the floor is shaking under me.

31
00:04:39,589 --> 00:04:43,750
Oh my God. All right. I'm coming to get you. When I get you, I mean die.

32
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,750
Where the hell are you? I got a big open space where I'm standing right now. You can make it.

33
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:56,889
Just don't hit any trees. All right. Where are you? Above you.

34
00:04:56,889 --> 00:05:01,129
Oh, there you are. All right. Now nice and easy. Come and land right here.

35
00:05:02,709 --> 00:05:06,790
And where are you going? What are you doing?

36
00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:23,319
Okay. What happened?

37
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:25,319
Just seen a car.

38
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:27,319
Dude, a car. A car.

39
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:51,980
It shot. It shot like a million feet into the air.

40
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,060
Oh, my head hurts from laughing at that.

41
00:05:54,779 --> 00:06:01,529
My blades fell off. Oh my God. I just gave myself an aneurysm laughing at that.

42
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:07,689
Really flew like into space. What am I doing?

43
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:18,839
Why am I not seeing these amazing things? Why am I never present at the good stuff?

44
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:21,800
I remember turning beautiful. Oh my God.

45
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:27,269
It's been too long since I played this game, man. I'm crying.
