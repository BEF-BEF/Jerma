1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,070
Let's go. Morning, Dread. Glad you could make it for reorientation.

2
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:27,539
I didn't expect that to work. This is your health meter showing how much health you have.

3
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,850
If it drops to zero, you will die. Oh, that's what a health meter is.

4
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:40,200
It will protect you from occasional hits, but it cannot stand. Watch it. Watch it.

5
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,200
Mission failed. They got fed up. They couldn't take it anymore.

6
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,200
They couldn't take my face punching anymore. And now the whole team is...

7
00:00:54,909 --> 00:00:58,109
Dispense some justice.

8
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:06,540
Got a protest out here. Ladies and gentlemen, if you could please refrain from protesting this close to the city gates.

9
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,980
I'd appreciate it. You know what? Just, you're under arrest.

10
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:19,150
Put the signs down. Put the sign down. Everybody chill out. You're all under arrest.

11
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:28,150
Ten years for protesting? That sucks. Ten years for protesting.

12
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:39,250
Why is he going away for life? Why is he...

13
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:49,250
Dude, this guy's going away for life. He did the exact same crime as everybody else and he's going away for his life.

14
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:55,790
Holy shit.

15
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:02,219
Look at this lady. Oh my god.

16
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:08,219
She even has a thing on her back that says, oh yeah, oh yeah.

17
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:13,780
You see, I wasn't even going to make that joke. This game made that joke for me.

18
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:19,020
This is a female beer. It is. It even says it on her fucking shirt.

19
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:24,849
What am I arresting her for?

20
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:27,849
Three months for what?

21
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:38,050
Bank robbery. I'm on it. Bank robbery. Oh, bank robbery.

22
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:44,789
Toss another grenade. Got him. Get down.

23
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:48,500
Can't see anything right now.

24
00:02:50,509 --> 00:02:56,879
This is worse than TF2. How long am I on fire for? That sucked.

25
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:05,900
Anybody else? I got one of you guys. I'm out of bullets.

26
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:16,280
I probably shouldn't be killing everybody right now, but you know what? They're shooting at us. They're shooting at officers.

27
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:26,870
What are we supposed to do? What happened to you? Is that a judge?

28
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,870
That is a judge. Don't spread it to me, dude.

29
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:35,349
Somebody help him. I feel like I need to help him.

30
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:40,919
Is there anything I can do to help you? I don't think so.

31
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:44,099
I'm pretty sure you're just on fire forever.

32
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:47,590
That's got to be a terrible, terrible way to go.

33
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:53,860
Move. You're going to have to move, dude. I can't arrest this guy if you're circling him.

34
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,860
Look what you did.

35
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:02,419
Dude, that had to be done. That had to be done, and you all know it.

36
00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:09,139
Get out of my town.

37
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:13,020
Oh, does your buddy want to follow me around? Does your buddy want to follow me?

38
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,019
Is that what he wants to do? Not anymore.

39
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:21,620
Why are the people still out? The vampires are everywhere.

40
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:29,790
You think they'd be like an emergency bulletin. They're just running around killing everybody.

41
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:34,439
They're just running around killing every single citizen.

42
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:40,240
Okay. Okay.

43
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:47,019
You know, you could run. That's an option, you know.

44
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:52,319
Citizens of Judged Red City number five, you could run.

45
00:04:52,319 --> 00:05:00,730
Break out. You can't handle that.

46
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,540
You guys could not handle that.

47
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,540
All you had to do was shoot. You guys went through the same training that I went through.

48
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,540
And you can't shoot a zombie at point blank range.

49
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:14,170
I can't even. I don't even want to look at you two.

50
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:19,720
You know we can.

51
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,939
Could use a little bit of help here.

52
00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:25,939
Come on, people.

53
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:28,629
Again. Again.

54
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:35,529
Mr. Medical Man.

55
00:05:35,529 --> 00:05:38,339
How is he the only one to get out of that?

56
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:40,339
This guy is the only person to get out.

57
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:43,339
And he literally has no weapons and he's been walking.

58
00:05:43,339 --> 00:05:50,319
Oh my goodness.

59
00:05:50,319 --> 00:06:01,740
I got too many bullets ricocheting.

60
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:07,180
What the fuck? That guy wasn't dead?

61
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,550
What? Oh, dude.

62
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:15,060
Dude, you know what just happened right there?

63
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,259
He just got a bullet ricocheted in his head.

64
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:26,300
That was awesome.

65
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,300
Wait, do I just have to survive during like a gang war?

66
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:36,459
Why are you shooting me?

67
00:06:36,459 --> 00:06:38,459
You're supposed to be... There's a suspect in there.

68
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:40,459
What the... See what the fuck you did?

69
00:06:40,459 --> 00:06:42,459
You turned and you shot me.

70
00:06:42,459 --> 00:06:44,459
And it ended up getting you killed.

71
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:46,459
Like, what were you doing?

72
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:48,899
Holy shit, dude.

73
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:51,649
You need to get your glasses examined.

74
00:06:51,649 --> 00:06:57,490
It's still blinking mission failed and I can still move around.

75
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:01,439
You get down.

76
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:05,540
Oh, it's another judge.

77
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,540
I went rogue.

78
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,899
I went rogue.

79
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:11,899
I went rogue.
