1
00:00:01,909 --> 00:00:12,710
Yeah, I'm here. I'm here. This dude hates sorcery. I don't hate sorcery.

2
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:23,429
I don't hate sorcery. Why'd you get, where'd you get that idea? I mean you thought there was

3
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:30,339
gonna be sorcery today, but you were wrong and so was I. And there's a reason for it.

4
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:41,770
Reason number one, to be very clear. Uh, I didn't want to play it for like an hour and 40 minutes.

5
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:51,130
Reason number two, pre-stream chat decided, they decided, not to do it today.

6
00:00:52,500 --> 00:01:01,880
It's like 150 people guys. Pre-stream chat wanted their, their own sorcery stream. Its own stream,

7
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:09,900
not just like a couple hours. And the new Hitman map came out and what is this thing popping up

8
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:16,299
on the top of my, what is this? What's this new thing they added? I keep seeing the different subs

9
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:24,260
pop in and out. I don't like this. How do I get rid of this? How do I get rid of this activity feed?

10
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:32,620
I don't want this activity feed. Anyways, uh, yeah, sorcery will be its own thing.

11
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:41,430
Uh, we're also going to play multiverses today in a sponsor segment. I fucking love that game,

12
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:58,569
by the way. While I was kind of sick, I was been playing it on my Xbox. Shhh. I'm just sitting

13
00:01:58,569 --> 00:02:05,319
there sick playing it on Xbox. Xbox Andy. Yeah, guess what? Series S. What's wrong with it?

14
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:20,699
It's everything you want in a console. I actually believe that. The Xbox is a stinker. No, it is not.

15
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:28,360
The Xbox Series S is actually really good. You get the game pass on there. You can put on YouTube

16
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:35,939
and Twitch. It's like a media box for me. It's not a console. That's literally your worst take.

17
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:40,900
I just made that up. I made that person up. No one said that. I combined three messages.

18
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:47,240
Somebody said, that is your worst. And then somebody said, I'm getting takeout tonight.

19
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:56,580
And I just combined them to make my narrative make sense. Anyways, uh, Hitman has a new map.

20
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:03,669
I played all the Hitmans, obviously. So we're going to do this. I'm feeling better. A lot better

21
00:03:03,669 --> 00:03:10,009
than I was a week ago. So I think I'm all right now. For those of you that were curious, COVID

22
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:16,810
kind of came through the house a week and a half ago or so. And then I got put into a colitis flare

23
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:24,819
up probably because of it. I'm negative for COVID, but I have this colitis problem. So, but that's

24
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:28,580
getting worse. That's fine. That's not out of the ordinary. I know how to deal with that,

25
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:37,370
but we're good to go. Anyways, let me tweet. Give me one second. I got to make sure I get this right.

26
00:03:37,370 --> 00:05:22,620
One sec. Hey, I'm back. All right. So let's do the Hitman map. I haven't played Hitman since Hitman 3

27
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:27,540
VR, which I wasn't a big fan of. In fact, I was very, very adamantly opposed to it.

28
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:34,329
Must be a long ass tweet. No, it wasn't. I just, I had to go grab, I had to get something.

29
00:05:34,329 --> 00:05:49,240
All right. You guys ready for Hitman? You guys good for Hitman? Okay. Is the new map any good?

30
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,259
How does it compare to the rest of the series? Am I going to like it? Am I going to hate it?

31
00:05:54,259 --> 00:06:04,310
How is it? Be honest. Don't sugar coat this. Is it all right? No idea. I mean, it literally came out

32
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:12,680
like two, three days ago. So maybe you don't know. All right, let's go. What's my title? Oh,

33
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,019
it's all right. That title's fine. It's another concrete level. It fucking better not be.

34
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:36,899
I actually mean that. It better not be. Is it actually? Better not be. That's fucking loud.

35
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:47,290
All right. Are you guys ready? Destinations. It's this Ambrose Island. Is this new one?

36
00:06:47,290 --> 00:07:02,680
Are you guys ready for this? Should I turn it up? Should I turn it down? Handsome.

37
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:18,360
Go away. Red Andy. My skin is tinted a little orange. So what? Fuck off. I have like red,

38
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,910
I have red, rosy, red cheeks. Fuck you. All right. You got a problem?

39
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:44,149
Then speak it into the speaker. The Ark Society's annual.

40
00:07:44,149 --> 00:07:53,560
Are all these people dead? Which should give us ample time. Mr. Gray has an off the books

41
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:58,709
request. Perhaps you should explain. I actually don't know. No crest.

42
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:03,990
Spoilers. My best fixes. It's Hitman three. It's your fault for being here.

43
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:10,339
The militia literally hit man three to cease all attacks on Providence.

44
00:08:10,339 --> 00:08:24,060
Stand by and crest and his men reinventing themselves as a glorified gang of international

45
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:31,819
thieves. They specialize in ruthless spectacle, heists, zero regard to collateral damage.

46
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:37,480
I've seen the man's file. What did you expect? It's not like I had much choice.

47
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,000
Seeing as all my best lieutenants were killed by you too.

48
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:58,360
Crest is a rabid dog is my responsibility. Shut up. You don't care. An isolated harbor

49
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:04,679
north from the Strait of Malacca. Coincidentally, one of Wazir's old ports of call.

50
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:11,240
According to my intel crest and his men have joined forces with the local pirate syndicate

51
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:18,120
to raid a passing tanker. His goal control unit for an ether core being covertly shipped abroad.

52
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:23,960
The satellite is a node in the company's most secure cloud storage network.

53
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:30,840
So they would bear a fortune to preserve its integrity. What is Crest's end game extortion?

54
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:36,919
Money. If I had to guess, we don't have the luxury of a full investigation for us to move

55
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:41,960
against the constant. We need Providence to think the threat is over and lower their guard.

56
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:50,659
Another militia attack on ether will raise alarms. I agree. 47. You'll need to eliminate

57
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:56,980
Crest and destroy that control unit before we lock the militia out. The satellite cannot fall into

58
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:03,299
their hands. We'll need a cover story for ICA. I only need one grenade and I'll be able to do it

59
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:09,779
easily. The syndicate already has an active ICA contract on her head. Take her out and

60
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:16,740
we'll even get our expenses paid. Well, I never had you pegged as a rebel. I'm warming to it.

61
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:21,379
Are you eating toothpaste? What are you talking about? 47, seeing as I know Crest,

62
00:10:21,379 --> 00:10:29,830
I'll provide field support. Meet you out east. Sounds like a plan. 47 out.

63
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:43,820
You hate it. Go again. Fucking relax. I haven't streamed like a week. Sorry, guys. I have a lot

64
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:52,019
of energy right now. Um, hold on. Uh, I gotta turn this back on and ask me what happened. Hey,

65
00:10:52,019 --> 00:11:05,110
there I am. All right. So we need to, uh, we need to, we gotta kill, kill, kill. I haven't played

66
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:09,559
Hitman in a while either. What's with the toothpaste stuff? I don't know. Why are you asking about

67
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:19,500
toothpaste? Can somebody fill me in on what the toothpaste thing is here? It's toothpaste joke.

68
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:24,629
I don't get it. All right, let's go. Uh, I, I'm going to do default Andy. That's fine.

69
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:33,029
Neutralize the satellite control unit. Easy enough. You know, I, I keep avoiding on,

70
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:43,139
I feel like this is a YouTube embedded video. Is it? It is. Okay. I thought that was,

71
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:55,179
but how do I go? Okay. Play. All right. Let's go. Let's go. It's been a while since I've

72
00:11:55,179 --> 00:11:59,820
turned a computer on. I'm not fucking around. I've not turned this computer on. I have not

73
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:06,970
turned on the computer in five days. I think that's accurate. All right. Professionals fine.

74
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:19,350
Master. Why is this on master? Who did that? I didn't do that. Is it weird that I actually?

75
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:32,889
No, we're not doing master. No way. When did I put master on? Try master for one life? No,

76
00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:43,620
I don't think so. Just in time. It seems crest didn't disclose the true object of the heist to

77
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:49,460
his partners. Okay. So Acre has seized one of the satellite control units, key cards as collateral

78
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:56,419
until they can renegotiate. The militia have set up camp near the remains of a colonial outpost.

79
00:12:56,419 --> 00:13:02,340
Both crest and the control unit should be nearby. You'll need to destroy the unit itself or render

80
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:07,779
it inoperable by retrieving both key cards. Give me a grenade crest. He'll have given his to someone

81
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:13,700
he trusts, but Acre is less inclined to delegate. She should be in the pirate place when she's not

82
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:20,600
out among the locals. Okay. I provided you with a GPS tracker. Activate it when you're done and

83
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:28,220
I'll initiate extraction. The sooner we finish up here, the better. All right. Sounds easy enough.

84
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:33,980
I thought it was like a superhero costume. I was like, holy shit, I have like a superhero costume on.

85
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:42,740
Okay. How are we doing? We effing? It's going to happen. Unfortunately, I have to deal with it

86
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:47,620
for now. Okay. Eliminate, eliminate, deny access to the surveillance satellite,

87
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:58,409
destroy the satellite. Who's this guy? All right. Let's get over here. It's like an island.

88
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:18,980
Am I allowed in here? How's this? I'm not trespassing. What? I'm just going to the freezer.

89
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:37,830
This is just weird. Okay. Is there anything I can do in here? Wait, fish. Got it. Can I take, wait,

90
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:51,000
what's this? A fishing line. Okay. Might be useful later. All right. We're good. All right.

91
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:58,620
Let's go. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not going to, I'm not going to. These are the targets. No, what? No,

92
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:14,179
they're not. Not even close. Destroy satellite control unit. Do I have to do that or can I just

93
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:19,500
throw a brick through a window and hit the person in the head? Stop saying teeth. I don't know what

94
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:29,029
that means. I'm going to go this way. What do I have for weapons? How do I open up my menu? Is it

95
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:40,279
tab? Holds a button. What's the menu? I, yeah. Okay. GPS tracker. Coin. Gun. All right. Let's go.

96
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:59,879
I forgot how pretty this game was. Okay. Right over here. That's the first target. Should I

97
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:05,399
change disguise? I'm just kind of a guy in a scuba outfit. Is that weird? Is it weird for me to be

98
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:25,320
look like this? Is this weird? You too? No, this is not weird. Why do I have music? Holy shit. This

99
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:49,159
guy's got a whole studio in here. I got to get in there. This streamer. Please go away from me.

100
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:57,929
How do I get in here? Why can't I go in? I can't climb in this. I have a lockpick though, don't I?

101
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:05,380
Let's put the gun away, please. Don't I have a lock? Yeah, I do. I don't have a lockpick. How?

102
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:26,599
All right. I need to find the key. I need to get in that streamer room. Pretty much how I do

103
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:32,200
fishing as well. How many of you guys go fishing and just cast into the water and just reel it

104
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,279
back and you're not even trying? You're just humoring the one friend that actually wants to

105
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:44,710
be there. Okay. I don't know how to get in there, but is there Intel over there? No.

106
00:18:03,619 --> 00:18:11,829
Okay. All right. This person's right over here. Wait, what's that?

107
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:32,900
I'm making sure I have a lot of stuff too. What is this? What? Is it arm wrestling?

108
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:54,220
Okay. I've seen these videos before. I've seen. Let's go. You want to fucking go?

109
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:07,450
Hold on. I can't save right now? Next round. Let's see. What happened? All right. I'm ready.

110
00:19:08,089 --> 00:19:24,490
Ready up. Wind up. I don't get it. Do I have to tap? Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap. Okay.

111
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:43,319
You hurt his hand on my face. Why am I making it out of cement? All right. I'm going to get

112
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:55,609
this guy right here. See you later. I killed that guy. I legitimately, I think I just killed him.

113
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:34,859
Come on. Get up here. I have to go through all of them. Okay. Should I just drop him? Shut up.

114
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:41,980
Why don't you get up here and show me? Wait, this is the guy.

115
00:20:49,029 --> 00:21:09,130
I hope I can do it to him. So now what? I get to be friends with this guy?

116
00:21:10,089 --> 00:21:21,740
Can I save the game? I would save the game. I can't save it. I have to just do this until

117
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:37,240
I can stop. Okay. Is it going to like cut to the next scene where every single person in the town

118
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:44,200
has a red hand on their face and I'm like counting hundreds? I don't understand. How many more times

119
00:21:44,200 --> 00:22:05,589
do I have to do this? What the fuck? Why didn't they shoot me? Why didn't they do anything?

120
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:15,059
I'm so confused. What? Why didn't they do anything? I don't understand why they didn't do anything.

121
00:22:15,619 --> 00:22:20,329
I literally aimed the gun and shot the guy in the head and everyone was aiming at me.

122
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:38,180
I'm going to do this to everybody here. I'm going to hit every single person here.

123
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:52,230
Should I? Krust appears impressed and has requested to talk with you. Oh wait. That's me

124
00:22:53,450 --> 00:23:05,619
talking to me. What's up? I guess so. I want to talk to you about something in private.

125
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:10,900
Nothing sinister. There's no hard feelings here. I just have an offer for you. Come and hear me out.

126
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:18,460
That's all I ask. Are we going to go with a bodyguard? Hey, are you the guy that can

127
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:23,740
clearly kick the shit out of every bodyguard I have stronger than all my men? Come over here

128
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:30,619
in private with me alone. I'm the wicked rich guy. Why would we do this alone? Should I just

129
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:35,940
do it now? Oh my god. There are two bodyguards here. I was about to strangle them.

130
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:52,549
Bro, you're going to stand right next to the red barrel. This guy was talking shit earlier

131
00:23:52,549 --> 00:23:59,269
about cartoons. You're in one right now. What? You're standing right next to the red explosive

132
00:23:59,269 --> 00:24:08,380
barrel. Okay.

133
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:17,099
Punishment someone who could be an inside man but won't buckle under intense interrogation

134
00:24:17,099 --> 00:24:22,380
if he's caught. I'd do it myself but my time and expertise would be better spent covering our tracks

135
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:27,420
and you've shown me that my guys aren't up for the job either. Smoking next to a red cartoon

136
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:42,470
barrel. I can hold my own. Excuse me. Why was he itching his wrists? That guy was itchy.

137
00:24:43,029 --> 00:24:50,359
He didn't even. Why did it not explode? Hold on. Why did it not explode? He was just itching his arm.

138
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:59,109
Hollywood about it. Hold on. Come on. Your attention span can't be that fucking.

139
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:27,349
I'm gonna hide. I can't even. Where am I going? What happened? Should I do it for real? I gotta

140
00:25:27,349 --> 00:25:42,839
do it for real. I gotta do it for real. I have to do that mission for real. Let me do it for real.

141
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:48,380
I'm gonna do it for real. I'll do it for real. I'm gonna do it for real. All right. I'm gonna do it

142
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:58,970
for real. For real. For real. No more fucking around. Could I have poisoned his cigar or something?

143
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:08,390
Certain prominent individuals, government facilities, big targets. But that means big payouts.

144
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:12,710
I'm looking for someone who can take a little punishment. Someone who could be an inside man.

145
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:17,269
Okay. Buckle under intense interrogation if he's caught. I'd do it myself but my time and

146
00:26:17,269 --> 00:26:22,630
expertise would be better spent covering our tracks. And you've shown me that my guys aren't up for the

147
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:28,549
job either. I need someone I can depend on. I can hold my own. I know we only just met but you have

148
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:34,789
this quality to you. I can't really pin it down. It's familiar but alien at the same time and

149
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:39,589
your face. Don't take this the wrong way but it feels like if I looked away for a minute I'd

150
00:26:39,589 --> 00:26:45,589
completely forget every feature. You might be my missing piece here. I don't need or want a decision

151
00:26:45,589 --> 00:26:49,750
right now. This is a life-changing choice. I know we just met. It could be the start of some big

152
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:55,430
things for you but there would be no backing out. I don't need any more disappointments. Make sure

153
00:26:55,509 --> 00:27:00,150
this is what you really want. I'll be here for a few more days at least so

154
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:10,980
no rush. I'll think about it. What happened? What's going on? Can I say yes? What was that?

155
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:37,450
No fuck you! I wanted his outfit! No shit! I wanted the outfit. Oh god damn it. I swear to god.

156
00:27:38,009 --> 00:27:43,930
Government facilities big targets but that means big payouts. Just puncture the barrel.

157
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:50,220
Someone who could be an inside man but won't buckle. Yeah I'll do it. How do I say I'll do it?

158
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:54,059
I'd do it myself but my time and expertise would be better spent covering our tracks.

159
00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:59,220
How do I say yes I'll do it? You've shown me that my guys aren't up either. I need someone I can

160
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:09,299
depend on. I can hold my own. I know we only just met but you have this quality to you. I can't

161
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:13,940
really pin it down. It's familiar alien at the same time and your face. I think I have to go

162
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:17,619
find him again. I don't take this the wrong way but it feels like if I looked away for a minute

163
00:28:17,619 --> 00:28:23,059
I'd completely forget every feature. But if I go get a different disguise won't he not know who I am?

164
00:28:23,059 --> 00:28:27,539
If you want a decision right now this is a life-changing choice. It could be the start

165
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:32,420
of some big things for you. Okay no backing out. I'll do it. I don't need any more disappointments.

166
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:37,859
Make sure this is what you really want. Yes. I'll be here for a few more days at least so

167
00:28:37,859 --> 00:28:47,619
okay. All right so I was fine. I freaked out. Okay sounds good. Yes I'll do it. So now I'll

168
00:28:47,619 --> 00:28:58,569
just have to go talk to him again. Thank you. All right goodbye. I need to find out what that is

169
00:28:58,569 --> 00:29:29,910
right? Like what's going on here? Is somebody in this house moaning? Why? They're in there.

170
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:44,250
Am I allowed to go in here? We can't enjoy the fucking movie. Why? We can't hear anything.

171
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:52,220
All right let's watch it. Turn off the projector. You need to.

172
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:08,630
What happens if I do this?

173
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:25,670
You know you weren't even watching the video. You weren't even watching the video.

174
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,500
Dangerous fucker.

175
00:31:17,049 --> 00:31:34,710
That guy got out of here quick. I don't have a disguise on. Why did Peter Griffin just come in?

176
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:53,849
That's just fucking out of place. Hey Loish remember that time. I'm in trouble. I gotta

177
00:31:53,849 --> 00:32:02,730
get out of here. That's the guy. That's the guy. That's the guy. That's the guy. That's the guy.

178
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:19,960
That's the guy. That's the guy. That's the guy. What was he doing outside the door? Holy crap.

179
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:52,779
Don't do it. Don't open it. Clueless. Wait is this the guy that was in here originally?

180
00:32:52,779 --> 00:32:56,920
You're not going to sit down and watch the YouTube video right? No you're not going to

181
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:16,890
come back and watch the YouTube video. It's just smoke. Did I win? I have to wait. There's

182
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:32,410
another person to kill. I dropped my cigarette. It was in my mouth and I dropped it. Somebody help.

183
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:33,690
My cigarette hit the ground.

184
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:50,059
Did she just puke? I have to get out of here. I have to get out of here.

185
00:33:52,900 --> 00:34:10,139
I have to leave. Alright everybody get out. I wonder what he's going to do. Does he remember?

186
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:34,920
You remember me? No fuck. No I'm back in this stupid. Alright I'm going to do it for real.

187
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:47,190
How do you jump? I gotta do it for real. I gotta do it for real. Do it for real. Do it for real.

188
00:34:47,829 --> 00:34:55,500
I can't help it. It's like fucking Grand Theft Auto. Alright so I gotta go back and talk to that guy.

189
00:34:56,539 --> 00:35:05,110
Okay yep yep yep yep yep. So I gotta go talk to that guy and say I'll do it.

190
00:35:05,829 --> 00:35:19,059
Ready to go up here? Yep alright so he's over there. Newspaper I'll take it. I keep thinking

191
00:35:19,059 --> 00:35:24,579
somebody is hitting me in the fucking face in real life. That's hitting me in the face in real life

192
00:35:24,579 --> 00:35:38,039
every time I hear it. Okay so are you? It's in. Oh this is. Oh. Hold on. Getting them both in place

193
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:45,579
would certainly save some time. Okay so should I go to the meeting? I'm using the light to signal

194
00:35:45,579 --> 00:35:50,059
for Crest when she wants a meeting. The light. It shouldn't be too difficult to exploit that. Okay.

195
00:35:52,059 --> 00:35:58,539
Also known as Akka, leader of the pirates. She should be carrying one of the key cards for the

196
00:35:58,539 --> 00:36:14,650
control unit. Okay. Is this weird to do this? Probably. I mean is it is this is it weird to

197
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:32,460
do this? I mean it's kind of odd but is it really gonna get me in trouble? Alright I'm gonna go

198
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:41,719
talk to that guy. He's like come find me if you want to actually do the thing. Alright let's go.

199
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:52,460
I want to do like a fun mission. I just want to throw fish at people. God damn it. Okay this is

200
00:36:52,460 --> 00:37:14,949
interesting. Whatever this is. What's going on in here? There's always a chef. Have you guys noticed

201
00:37:14,949 --> 00:37:20,460
that? There's always just the kitchen with the kitchen knife and the chef where you can

202
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:35,219
poison the meat. Really? Oh this is I guess I'm not allowed. You don't. He didn't seem to really give

203
00:37:35,219 --> 00:38:09,780
a shit. Okay. What can I do in here? Can they see? What happened? I need to get a disguise or just

204
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:24,679
say fuck it and not go in. There's not a good opportunity for a disguise. Where's my coin?

205
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:36,409
I have this mission going already. Let me just do this one. This seems like the best idea. He's

206
00:38:36,409 --> 00:38:43,139
like come find me and tell me if you want to do it or not. So let's go do it. I just walk up to

207
00:38:43,139 --> 00:38:59,860
him? Alright I'm ready. I'm ready to do your fucking weird mission. Alright I'm ready to do

208
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:10,489

209
00:39:10,489 --> 00:39:29,769

210
00:39:29,769 --> 00:39:47,699
right? Where are you going now? Subdue? No I'm not going to subdue. That's such a simple way to do

211
00:39:47,699 --> 00:39:57,590
this. He said I need a man like you to be able to you know fucking take you know pain or something

212
00:39:57,590 --> 00:40:08,389

213
00:40:08,389 --> 00:40:28,260
guy's security guard. I mean I there's got to be a way I can activate this right? That was the chance

214
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:35,500
to kill him. Oh but I thought he wanted to make join me like me we join oh now he's back watching

215

216
00:40:44,969 --> 00:41:03,900
I'm the slap guy. What? That was your opportunity. Um alright so let me I gotta go to the meeting.

217
00:41:07,659 --> 00:41:28,789
I don't even care about winning. Wait Intel he's checking in with the military base regularly.

All right I need a military outfit. I need a military outfit. How do I get? I'm going in here.

226
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:45,719
Genuinely who was? There's nobody behind me. I don't give a shit. I don't care. This is a hard

227
00:44:45,719 --> 00:45:03,059
mission. I don't give a shit. Turn the vacuum off. It's gonna make me fucking scream. Okay go in the

231
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:44,699
this guy now. You're going to the toothpaste convention. What's with this? What's with the

232
00:46:44,699 --> 00:47:08,730
teeth thing? I don't get the teeth thing. I have an idea. Nobody can even see me right now. I actually

233
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:29,380
don't think they can see me. Oh yeah they can. I thought like metal gear solid you know. There's

234
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:56,730
like the window where they can't see. Okay what's that? Hold on. This is a water pump. Repairs on

235
00:47:56,730 --> 00:48:01,699
Chris's boat are held up and it doesn't look like they're going to happen anytime soon. Perhaps the

236
00:48:01,699 --> 00:48:22,699
local mechanics could use an extra set of hands. Okay. Okay. Do you need some help?

237
00:48:23,019 --> 00:48:38,630
I need a screwdriver.

238
00:48:54,599 --> 00:49:06,010
How do you guys not have? How is that not a screwdriver? Oh there's a wrench. No it's a pipe.

239
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:20,579
Is there no wrench in here? A crowbar? Use cell. How is there no wrench?

240
00:49:47,460 --> 00:50:10,440
I just like what the fuck am I supposed to do? I mean where's the wrench? I love throwing car

241
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:13,239
batteries. We already went over this right? How many car batteries would it take to actually

242
00:50:13,239 --> 00:50:32,280
electrify the ocean? That's far away. Not really. A signal light on the radar tower. So when does

243
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:41,800
that happen? Should I just go? Hold on. So what they're gonna flash a bat signal and I'm supposed

244
00:50:41,800 --> 00:51:05,750
to go to the meeting? I can trigger it. Oh let's go do that. What's the best way to get there?

245
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:19,510
What do you want? What of it? Yeah. Yeah. What about it?

246
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:35,510
What do you find? A coconut? I has asked 47 to fetch her a coconut. How quaint. But who

247
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:48,889
knows what may come from doing a favor for it. All right let's go get a coconut. Coconut right

248
00:51:48,889 --> 00:52:06,389
here. How do I get there? Do I have to climb this? Can I shoot it down with a gun? People are not

249
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:39,739
gonna freak out about this right? What the fuck? Huh? What the? Okay um that's not how you get them.

250
00:52:39,739 --> 00:53:02,219
Oh what the fuck? Oh what? Were those not coconuts? They definitely were. Okay where would I? Okay I

251
00:53:02,219 --> 00:53:06,780
have to destroy the control unit or yeah I'm gonna destroy it. I'm not gonna go get fucking

252
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:43,380
access keys. No thanks. Let's go destroy it. I'm technically allowed in here. Where's that camera?

253
00:53:43,380 --> 00:54:27,289
They don't care. I'm allowed to be down here. I'm in the uniform right? Okay never mind. Really?

254
00:54:27,289 --> 00:54:40,659
What are the weird cartoon objects do I have? It's only two. That was louder than anything else

255
00:54:40,659 --> 00:54:57,800
I've done so far. Can I hide them anywhere? Not really. Bring the fish back. What's quick save?

256
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:16,139
How do I quick save? Whatever somebody comes down here they come down here. Five. If somebody comes

257
00:55:16,139 --> 00:55:25,530
down they come down. Whatever. What am I gonna do about it? F5? All right let's go. While I'm

258
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:43,019
allowed down here. Fire extinguisher? Okay I gotta be careful. That's the control unit. You'll need

259
00:55:43,019 --> 00:55:49,179
to either destroy it or deny access to keep the ether satellite out of the militia's hands. Oh

260
00:55:49,179 --> 00:56:13,139
fuck. Stop talking to me. Holy shit there's a stalactite. I have to stalactite somebody right?

261
00:56:13,139 --> 00:56:41,099
I got him. When you're like on a security job and one of your co-workers gets killed by a stalactite

262
00:56:41,099 --> 00:56:57,989
you're not gonna you're gonna go investigate that. All right what is this? Fuse? Oh screwdriver thank

264
00:57:40,809 --> 00:57:56,039
accident of the stalactite. These were sharp and small. Oh this person's coming to the generator.

265
00:57:56,039 --> 00:58:10,179
Just slowly clear this whole remote. That'll make a ton of noise. I don't want to do that.

266
00:58:10,179 --> 00:58:46,539
Let me uh let me piano wire this guy. Dude I'm gonna set these motherfuckers up. I'm gonna set

267
00:58:46,539 --> 00:58:52,619
all five of these guys underneath the stalactite. So it's just like they were all sitting here

268
00:58:52,619 --> 00:59:05,210
having a smoke break and this giant stalactite killed everybody. Perfect. A tactical shotgun?

269
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:58,019
Hell yeah. Yeah you've you've you found something. No one's turning the generator off. Only two more

270
00:59:58,019 --> 01:00:34,949
people that's it. He's gonna hear the generator. Actually you know what? Fuck it. Some punk kid.

271
01:00:35,510 --> 01:00:49,449
All right I've successfully infiltrated. Okay hold on. No one else is here right? Laptop files.

272
01:00:49,449 --> 01:00:57,800
Crest wasn't planning to sell the control unit back to them at all. He was going to use the damn

273
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:14,699
thing. I suppose I was selling him short. Okay. Can I take the rack? Did I do it? Safety is on.

274
01:01:14,699 --> 01:01:38,420
What do you mean safety's on? Oh let's go. With the control unit in pieces the satellite's no longer.

275
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:46,139
Let's go. That's one problem taken care of. All right hell yeah. Let me get some uh extra stuff

276
01:01:46,139 --> 01:02:07,659
though. There's all kinds of like goodies here. All right not bad. Now I'm gonna go turn on the

277
01:02:07,659 --> 01:02:21,670
bat signal. Anything else I can do? That's it. All right let's go. So from here I'm gonna go

278
01:02:22,789 --> 01:02:32,170
drop disguise. Oh I'm gonna head this way. Get out of the cave. You need to kill the witnesses.

279
01:02:32,170 --> 01:02:43,110
They're not gonna get up. Those other two people will be dead far before I have to do that. It's

280
01:02:43,110 --> 01:02:50,630
not coming this way right? Yeah these guys have the two targets will be dead before they wake up.

281
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:55,190
And even if they do wake up. What you woke up in a cave and four people died by a stalactite. Does

282
01:02:55,190 --> 01:03:03,610
that really matter? I'm gonna be fine. I need to get rid of this. Don't aim the fucking gun. Throw

283
01:03:03,610 --> 01:03:12,679
it. How do I get rid of the gun? I don't want two guns on me at all times. Okay let's go do the bat

284
01:03:12,679 --> 01:03:23,900
signal. Z? Okay that's fine. All right that's better. All right let's set up the meeting.

285
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:39,269
I should be allowed in here right? Aren't I like personal private security?

286
01:03:40,730 --> 01:03:47,559
Please don't search me. All right you guys remember in the mask when they're like freeze and they

287
01:03:47,559 --> 01:03:53,500
start going through his pants and there's rubber chickens and clocks. I this is a lot of stuff to

288
01:03:53,500 --> 01:04:00,260
have to get rid of. I need to be a pirate. I have a pirate disguise literally right over. Okay well

289
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:23,989
I'm gonna go get it. Lock the hole in the sand castle? That seems just kind of set for. Let me

290
01:04:23,989 --> 01:04:47,610
get the pirate costume. Okay I thought one of them got up. All right so now I should be able to get

291
01:04:47,610 --> 01:05:04,519
in there. Why is that evil? All right that person can see through. Nobody else can right? No we're

292
01:05:04,519 --> 01:05:38,889
good. All right we're here. I want to turn that thing on. We're good. Oh oops. Do you stay this

293
01:05:38,889 --> 01:05:59,260
way or can you please turn? Fucking camera. Don't take my picture. It doesn't really matter. What

294
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:39,099
the fuck? Huh? I thought I had a crowbar. I don't care if I get seen. Doesn't matter. Yeah. Oh my

295
01:06:39,099 --> 01:07:06,809
god. Can I get in there? Don't say that. Friend of yours. 47. Don't. Why would you say that? Mr. Smith.

296
01:07:06,809 --> 01:07:16,019
47. Real thin ice with interval. This assignment was supposed to be a gimme. Tag along undercover

297
01:07:16,019 --> 01:07:21,860
on some tankers. Monitor the crews for any suspicious contact with pirates and sportsmen

298
01:07:21,860 --> 01:07:27,539
investigations with whatever info I found. Should have been a piece of cake. Do you need some help?

299
01:07:27,539 --> 01:07:33,059
Yeah. Haven't heard any keys on their leader when she comes by. If I had to guess I'd say

300
01:07:33,059 --> 01:07:36,820
she's keeping them somewhere private like an office. An office. If you can get those keys

301
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:43,739
and open this door I can get myself off this island. Got it. Okay. Turn up the volume. Okay.

302
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:55,420
Is that better? All right I need to find the keys. They're probably in an office. I don't

303
01:07:55,420 --> 01:08:03,340
whatever this is I'm touching it. Turn that off. Turn it off. I don't know what I just did. Turn

304
01:08:03,340 --> 01:08:08,760
it off. Turn it off. Turn it off. I'm sorry. I don't know what that does. I can't turn that off.

305
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:22,250
Did I fuck it up? I think I screwed it all up. I messed the whole thing up didn't I?

306
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:46,550
All right I gotta get I gotta knock these guys out and then use the printer or whatever that is.

307
01:09:07,619 --> 01:09:12,869
Oh my god I have so much stupid bullshit in my inventory. I don't even I whatever.

308
01:09:14,310 --> 01:09:23,640
I need something quiet. What's the quietest thing I have here? Probably a knife or this.

309
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:27,449
The fish is quiet. The fish is not quiet.

310
01:09:36,869 --> 01:09:49,399
What does that do? I don't even need to be in here. Is there a key anywhere?

311
01:09:50,119 --> 01:10:31,750
There's no key here. It's probably upstairs. I'm gonna stay over here right? Probably up here.

312
01:10:32,310 --> 01:10:46,489
Oh shit. Okay let's go go go. What do we got? Notes. Intel. Rough accumulation of intel about

313
01:10:46,489 --> 01:10:51,060
Crest and the militia in addition to because calculations about the value of the satellite

314
01:10:51,060 --> 01:10:56,100
itself where notes outline what Crest stands to gain from blackmailing ether and their clients

315
01:10:56,100 --> 01:11:10,060
with its data. Wow. There it is. Got the key. Holy shit this this thing is insane. Um throw this

316
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:26,340
out the window. I got the key. Was there anything else in here that I needed? I've got the key.

317
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:54,180
I'm gonna drop down. All right let's go. Now what? Who the hell are you and what were you doing on

318
01:11:54,180 --> 01:12:00,600
that tanker? If you don't start talking I'll cut one of those ears of yours off. Whether or not

319
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:08,279
I know who to send it to. Hey you. What happened? Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait.

320
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:18,300
Now all that's left to deal with. What did I do? Crest himself. I'm gonna get the fuck out of here.

321
01:12:21,510 --> 01:12:50,069
Like I said Carbat. I fucking electrified everybody. I gotta get the fuck out of here.

322
01:12:50,630 --> 01:12:56,729
Did you drop anything? An access hub? Key? Wait hold on. Open this door.

323
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:18,069
Are they coming in? No we're okay. Data entry and I don't know. Whatever. Go. Get out.

324
01:13:24,949 --> 01:13:28,229
Fuck. No no no no no no no no no. I don't. I don't. I don't. Just come in and investigate.

325
01:13:28,229 --> 01:13:35,560
Do whatever you need to do. Bye. Don't shoot him. Just run. I'm good. Save it. That is not how you're

326
01:13:35,560 --> 01:14:22,789
supposed to do that. Okay so that leaves us with the bat signal. Kick bag of bricks? The signal's

327
01:14:22,789 --> 01:14:48,710
lit. Their meeting should start soon. Am I gonna kick a bag of bricks on this guy? Here it comes.

328
01:14:48,710 --> 01:14:52,789
That guy doesn't know the meeting got cancelled. He doesn't know that um that I killed like all

329
01:14:52,789 --> 01:15:15,189
the people down here. He's no idea. This guy has absolutely no clue. Shit he's gone. What is this

330
01:15:15,189 --> 01:15:27,659
guy doing up here? Did I get him? Okay okay okay okay. He's coming. He's on his way. Dude I could

331
01:15:27,659 --> 01:16:14,979
probably just go like. I'll do it the right way. I'll do it the right way. I'll do it the right way.

332
01:16:14,979 --> 01:16:48,149
Relax. So this just dropped down here. Did they actually even walk by this? Where's he going? Wait

333
01:16:48,149 --> 01:17:01,659
where are all the dead bodies? They got rid of all the dead bodies. What distraction. This guy's not

334
01:17:01,659 --> 01:17:55,779
up here is he? Oh there he goes. Is he leaving? Investigate that. How far can I throw something?

335
01:18:06,859 --> 01:18:16,550
See what the hell that was. The meeting is not in the tower. That makes sense. You're right. Why

336
01:18:16,550 --> 01:18:21,000
would the meeting be in the tower? You're right. Yeah that's weird. Oh well let's just kill

337
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:32,550
whoever this is. What was I thinking? I don't know. This seems like a secluded place.

338
01:18:35,369 --> 01:18:42,010
Now fuck that. When Commissioner Gordon does the bat signal Batman goes to the bat signal on the

339
01:18:42,010 --> 01:18:58,489
roof. That's how in every single movie. Every single tv show. I have a sword now. All right

340
01:18:58,489 --> 01:19:12,409
whatever. I'm just gonna go kill him. Save it. Where is he? I'm gonna go slash this guy with

341
01:19:12,409 --> 01:19:28,140
a sword. You know what I mean? Like who cares? Shit it went the wrong way. Come on. Really?

342
01:19:34,329 --> 01:19:52,710
Metal worker? No. Oh hi. Hello. All right let's go this way. That's probably an escape route right

343
01:19:52,710 --> 01:20:22,090
there. All right fuck this guy. I've had enough. I'll get him alone here. He goes around the corner.

344
01:20:22,090 --> 01:20:32,630
When he goes around the corner I'll go for him. I mean this is way more. This is way more hilarious.

345
01:20:33,189 --> 01:20:47,909
Quarter out of my pocket. Fuck off. What what's so weird about that? What did I lose? What are you

346
01:20:47,909 --> 01:20:56,300
talking about? I took a oh actually thank you. I appreciate that. Usually people would just be

347
01:20:56,300 --> 01:21:01,180
like you know don't give a shit about somebody dropping something. I really appreciate it. Thank

348
01:21:01,180 --> 01:21:06,039
you. You thought I was gonna hit him in the face with the battle didn't you? I would have if it

349
01:21:06,039 --> 01:21:21,220
said uh the text came up but it didn't. Stop. Just focus. Oh shit you wanted a coconut. What do I get

350
01:21:21,220 --> 01:21:42,069
one? Where do you actually get a coconut? I want to do that. How do you actually get a coconut?

351
01:21:57,289 --> 01:22:07,770
Or something. No. I wanted to hit him with the. I wanted to hit him with the with the pad. I want

352
01:22:07,770 --> 01:22:14,010
to hit him with the board. I was waiting for. I don't know. Why can't I hit him with the board?

353
01:22:19,479 --> 01:22:36,010
I'm about to just throw it at this guy and run. You know what I mean? I might as well.

354
01:22:36,010 --> 01:22:41,979
The exit's probably right here. This is crass. What's your status?

355
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:54,520
I don't care anymore. Whatever. I genuinely don't care.

356
01:22:54,520 --> 01:23:05,590
That's that. How do I get this guy alone? Enable your vaude. It should be there.

357
01:23:06,869 --> 01:23:17,050
I don't. How do I get this guy alone? Shoot him from the tower. That's easier.

358
01:23:17,050 --> 01:23:32,409
I was throwing a fucking knife in his head. That's crest taken care of.

359
01:23:32,409 --> 01:23:37,909
And that's that. The rest will pick up the pieces. It's time to go 47.

360
01:23:37,909 --> 01:23:43,800
We need to secure the area. I'll see you soon. For your own safety. Do you understand?

361
01:23:43,800 --> 01:24:03,220
Don't head in the game. Get your head in the game. Anybody copy? No sign of any pub.

362
01:24:04,180 --> 01:24:12,460
You're supposed to be guarding stuff you lazy prick. I had to do it. You know I did.

363
01:24:12,460 --> 01:24:16,539
I had to do it. I had to do it. I had to do it. I had to do it. I don't care if I failed the mission.

364
01:24:16,539 --> 01:24:20,619
I had to hit that guy in the face for the video because they're going to edit the video right

365
01:24:20,619 --> 01:24:23,819
when I hit him in the face. It's going to cut to the next clip which is coming up here shortly.

366
01:24:23,819 --> 01:24:47,109
That's crest taken care of. And that's that. The rest will pick up the pieces.

367
01:24:48,069 --> 01:24:51,560
It's time to go 47. I'll see you soon.

368
01:25:12,659 --> 01:25:13,460
That was scary.

369
01:25:50,819 --> 01:25:54,420
Someone's fighting a gun. Help me. What? You're talking to me?

370
01:25:55,300 --> 01:26:13,880
Wait. Wait. Are you asking me for help? I'm so confused what happened. I don't care. What was

371
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:48,100
that? 47. That was a Homer Simpson scream. All right. I got 20,000 XP and oh okay. Unfortunately,

372
01:26:48,100 --> 01:27:08,460
unfortunately you got one star. Zero actually. That was kind of a fun mission. Oh all right.

373
01:27:08,460 --> 01:27:30,100
Cool. That was kind of fun. New personal best. That's the first time I've ever played it. All

374
01:27:30,100 --> 01:27:37,779
right. Was is there any? Is this the only DLC map or is that it? Are there any more DLC maps? I just

375
01:27:37,779 --> 01:27:45,350
want to see what the sword looks like when you hit somebody with it. See you. That's

376
01:27:45,670 --> 01:28:13,859
brutal. Okay. Is there any more? It's quick. It's very quick. Does it kill instantly? This is not

377
01:28:13,859 --> 01:28:22,090
knocking people out, right? It's fast and it kills people. That's kind of crazy. All right. Well,

378
01:28:22,090 --> 01:28:26,899
that's fun. Let me see. Anything else to do? Otherwise we'll play some multiverses. We'll

379
01:28:26,899 --> 01:28:41,430
move to multiverses after this. Play the scary card game. I did. I played scary card game. Save

380
01:28:41,430 --> 01:28:50,890
the guy, the people, people in the cage. It's over. I do art of wilds DLC. I probably will eventually.

381
01:28:51,659 --> 01:28:56,939
But like I heard it was kind of a little too puzzle based. I heard I wouldn't be very bad at

382
01:28:56,939 --> 01:29:03,380
it. I heard that I would not have fun playing it. That's what I was told. Fuck the plank of shame.

383
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:16,970
Art of wilds DLC. They lied to you. Okay. All right. Let's let's do multiverses. I'm ready to play.

384
01:29:16,970 --> 01:29:23,850
I've been kind of obsessed with this game. This is also going to be a sponsor segment.

385
01:29:24,409 --> 01:29:30,250
I've been playing this game a shitload on the couch sick on my xbox. I'm ready to game. That

386
01:29:30,250 --> 01:29:37,289
was fun though. What about, so VOD is still private. Why? Why does twitch keep changing this

387
01:29:37,289 --> 01:29:51,300
shit? It shouldn't be. Let's see. Hold on. Yeah. Why is this not published? I changed this setting.

388
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:59,689
I changed this setting like three days ago. What the hell? If I publish this right now,

389
01:29:59,689 --> 01:30:15,880
will it actually go through? That's kind of annoying. Publish this. Okay. Is it there?

390
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:31,479
Please confirm with me that you can see it. I hope so. Yeah. I went into my settings and I

391
01:30:31,479 --> 01:30:40,489
changed this already. This has already been changed. Where, what is it? What is it under?

392
01:30:40,489 --> 01:30:52,170
Stream settings. Store path. Always publish VODs. Dude, I did this already. Why are you doing this

393
01:30:52,170 --> 01:31:04,090
to me? Okay. That's whatever. All right. Let's do multiverses. Let's open it. I'm gonna do a quick

394
01:31:04,090 --> 01:31:11,180
BRB for one second because I need to set up a chatbot and stuff. So give me one sec. Gonna be

395
01:31:11,180 --> 01:31:16,310
playing a lot of LeBron. LeBron is really fun. Really good. I'll be right back.
