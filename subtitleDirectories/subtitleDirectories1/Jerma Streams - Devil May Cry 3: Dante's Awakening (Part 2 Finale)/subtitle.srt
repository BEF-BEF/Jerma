1
00:00:25,140 --> 00:01:25,379
Hello, how's it going? How's it going? He was saying you're late. Yeah, let's clear the record here though.

2
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:36,930
Well, let's clear my throat first and then we'll get into that. I was gonna stream on Friday, but I got the day wrong.

3
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:44,299
So I pulled it back to Thursday and then I decided, you know what? No, I'm pulling it back again. We're going on Wednesday.

4
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:54,069
And here we are. I said I was gonna be around three. It's a little after three, but I reverse delayed, reverse delayed into a small minor delay.

5
00:01:54,069 --> 00:02:12,810
I think that's fair. That's fair. You said Friday. Yeah, well, whatever. I'm here now. And it ain't Friday. I know. That's fine.

6
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:31,569
That's fine. That's a skewed concept of fair. Well, instead of having to having to wait two full days, you only had to wait 35 minutes.

7
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:48,300
That's fair for a stop. Your schedule has given me trust issues. Well, I guess the let me ask a question.

8
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:58,979
Is there a been be honest with me? Be very honest with me because I've been thinking about this for a while and and drop some names.

9
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:08,900
I'd love to hear them. I'm curious. Do you know of a streamer that is on time?

10
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:20,830
90 percent of the time, like a streamer that's like, OK, guys, you know, Thursday, I think I'm going to start streaming around like to who is always on time.

11
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:32,620
No matter what, they're always on time. I feel like most streamers are like 10 to 20 minute late, Andy's all of us.

12
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:55,500
You're literally the only one I'm not. That's no way. I'm definitely not the only one that's 10 plus minutes.

13
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:01,509
And I have a defense, though. I don't have a starting soon screen.

14
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:08,509
I have I do. But my starting soon screen means that I'm here right now.

15
00:04:08,509 --> 00:04:13,509
And the starting soon screen is at most maybe 60 seconds before I start talking.

16
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:20,389
Maybe a minute total. I don't have a starting soon that last 10 plus 20 plus minutes.

17
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:27,019
That is copium, but it's I think that's good copium. I think that's good copium.

18
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:43,930
You are a lying prick. Hey, damn, geez. No, no, let's hear about he has a point.

19
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:48,360
That's what I'm talking about. Yeah, we got the founders coming in.

20
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:59,750
We got the founders coming in. When are you going to do a Bugleberry mukbang?

21
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:07,019
Yeah, that should be kind of funny. It's wicked fucking gross shit.

22
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:21,949
It's just like would not. It's just weird. It's just weird food items.

23
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:28,579
When's Otto's adventure remake? When are you going to do the beach episode for your channel?

24
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:36,870
The beach episode? That's so funny.

25
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:42,949
Damn, that's a good one. That's such a good one, too.

26
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:56,100
Just do a sitcom level beach episode, but it's just a regular stream and it's only it's it's 22 minutes long.

27
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:04,050
I should just do an entire an entire tournament arc until I ruin the channel and nobody watches.

28
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:14,319
You know what I mean? Like I should have a like three month long tournament arc where you know I'm going to win.

29
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:23,259
You know I'm going to win the tournament and you have to watch like 70 other people lose before I just win it.

30
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:30,660
And there's a ton of drama every time I get up there, but there's no way I lose.

31
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:35,180
I'm just not going to in the end. You know it.

32
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:47,360
You know that at some point I will be in the finals no matter what happens.

33
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:53,329
End it with a time skip. Yeah.

34
00:06:53,329 --> 00:07:02,199
Holly, end it with a time skip that. Oh, my God. That's so right.

35
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,759
There's one thing I will promise you. There will be a point.

36
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:12,500
There will be a point where I just I'm just going to do whatever the fuck I want here.

37
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,500
And like it's going to be detrimental to the channel.

38
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,500
You know what I'm saying? Like it's going to happen eventually where it's just like whatever.

39
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:24,860
I'm going to do a fucking month long tournament arc and then do a time skip and just ruin the whole channel.

40
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:30,680
You know what I mean? Like who cares? At some point, let's just do it for fun. Who cares?

41
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:41,660
You do this already? Right now, he says. Right now, he says you do this now.

42
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:47,740
Well, whatever. That's fun to me.

43
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:52,740
There's also other things that I really want to just do that I think would just be fun to do.

44
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:59,139
I want to say this so bad, but somebody will steal it and I can't have this stolen.

45
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:02,810
I this is going to be so funny.

46
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:06,980
And I know, oh, my God, he's saying his own material is funny.

47
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:11,420
No, this is this is the funniest thing I've ever seen. I've ever heard of.

48
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:14,420
Now, that's a lie. That's actually like egomania.

49
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:19,420
But I don't want anyone to know this idea because I really do think you're going to steal it.

50
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:25,019
Oh, it's the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life. I'm going to puke blood.

51
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:33,379
I got to dial it back a little. I got to I got to like dial it down a little bit here.

52
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:38,580
What if it's not fun? Yeah, that's the thing. That's that's also true.

53
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:44,000
A lot of times when I when I have an idea for something, I don't usually talk about it at all.

54
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Because in the event that I get to the stage where I actually really am doing it and I go, this sucks.

55
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,179
This is awful. Then you didn't know about it.

56
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:55,179
And it wasn't funny. You guys are only seeing the things that I really thought

57
00:08:55,179 --> 00:08:58,179
were going to make it to that point that were really interesting.

58
00:08:58,179 --> 00:09:02,860
Lots of other stuff has fallen through that you did not hear of that you did not see.

59
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:09,690
We need our show failed idea stream.

60
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:19,450
There's a lot of you know, there's also things, too, that I think would be really, really interesting for 10 seconds.

61
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:24,700
And the problem with hiring a production crew

62
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,700
and spending a bunch of money on what amounts to 15 seconds,

63
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:33,129
a lot of times does not turn out to be worth doing, which kind of sucks

64
00:09:33,129 --> 00:09:37,129
because there's a lot of like 30 second material that I would love for you to see.

65
00:09:37,129 --> 00:09:43,139
But eventually it's just like, OK, that was oh, my God, that was I loved that.

66
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:45,570
All right. That's all I had to say today.

67
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:51,149
These would be explosive on YouTube short ticked. Oh, yeah.

68
00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:57,460
Just move. Just do tick tocks.

69
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:10,059
No, upload it to YouTube, then do a variety show.

70
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:15,580
But long story short, I know we were playing Devil May Cry,

71
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:21,389
but I love the little I love the little little micro jokes.

72
00:10:21,389 --> 00:10:30,379
They work so much for me. Depends.

73
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:36,409
But yeah, how do we even get on that? I don't even know.

74
00:10:36,409 --> 00:10:41,779
How did I why did I start talking about that?

75
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:47,409
All right. TLDR. I wish I had one hundred million dollars

76
00:10:47,409 --> 00:10:50,779
because I would just I would do one of these every day.

77
00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:53,340
That's it. But unfortunately, I don't have that.

78
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:59,429
I would be it would be very really if I were too much, though.

79
00:10:59,429 --> 00:11:05,779
You do. I do not. I do.

80
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:16,700
No, I do not. You don't have a billion.

81
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:21,889
No, I don't. Sorry to say play the game already.

82
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:27,259
I get my 10 to 15 minutes before starting a video game.

83
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:32,139
This is time for me to tell you about my day.

84
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:35,590
And then I will shut up and move on to the game.

85
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:38,590
But this is my 10 minutes here. I get the floor.

86
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:44,710
I get the floor before I wheel in the TV for us to watch in school here.

87
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:52,279
OK, it's been 20 minutes. It has been it has been 12 minutes total.

88
00:11:52,279 --> 00:12:03,419
Come on. All right. Let's go. Silence.

89
00:12:03,419 --> 00:12:07,049
Insolent viewers. Yeah, true.

90
00:12:07,049 --> 00:12:18,460
Does it ever scare you how many people watch your streams?

91
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:23,610
No, no, not really.

92
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:31,799
I think that we terrify him.

93
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:33,799
What a terrifying thing.

94
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:40,059
I have a question for all the Dante's Inferno enthusiasts out here.

95
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:44,370
Should I just play on easy and just grind souls?

96
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:49,940
Is that an easy way just to get some extra money?

97
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:55,539
Why are you doing that voice again? What voice?

98
00:12:55,539 --> 00:13:01,090
I'm not doing a voice. Why am I doing? I'm not doing a voice.

99
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:05,090
I just talk sometimes in different inflections when I'm talking about different things.

100
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:11,769
Just go still stay on normal. You have milk voice again.

101
00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:13,769
I do not have milk voice. I know what it is.

102
00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:25,309
I know what it feels like. Is this too loud?

103
00:13:25,309 --> 00:13:28,940
Hard to tell over here. OK. Oh, no, we saw this, didn't we?

104
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:41,179
We'll watch it again. It's fine.

105
00:13:41,179 --> 00:13:55,250
Turn up the volume. I will.

106
00:13:55,250 --> 00:14:03,840
We can't hear shit. I'll turn it up.

107
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:10,000
Imagine being in a movie theater and the movie is like 10 percent volume.

108
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,820
How long is it going to take before somebody says that?

109
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:18,179
Hey, we can't hear shit. Turn it up. What the fuck?

110
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:24,820
Five minutes. What do you think?

111
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,769
It would take two seconds.

112
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,440
It would probably take at least five minutes.

113
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:44,080
Now, that would be really funny if for some reason the volume was turned way down in a theater.

114
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:50,750
And that was that old was it THX that sound effect.

115
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,750
Imagine that played at like five percent volume.

116
00:14:52,750 --> 00:15:03,929
It would not hit hard at all. It would be kind of funny, actually.

117
00:15:03,929 --> 00:15:09,019
Is an audio delay there? I don't think so.

118
00:15:09,019 --> 00:15:23,570
Do you want to think you know what I think is the most important thing in any piece of media?

119
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:26,940
I mean this with my deepest heart.

120
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:39,570
Audio mixing is probably the most important thing.

121
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:47,740
Having audio be correct in a movie with different levels of how they're talking and different sound effects and music.

122
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:59,669
How loud there is such a fine line between this music is a little louder versus the movie is ruined now.

123
00:15:59,669 --> 00:16:03,679
It's the audio delay. I don't have what I don't have. I don't see one.

124
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:07,679
What you have ruining it right now. I didn't do it.

125
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:17,860
Look, there's no delay. There's no delay. I'm fine.

126
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:27,580
The subtitles were ahead. It's very common in the film.

127
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:32,039
This person had a decent take. Let's see.

128
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:37,039
You can carry the piece very far. It's very common in film and video industry that if you have a good sound person.

129
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:45,379
Oh, yeah. Sound is even something you don't even think of like when like a bird flies by.

130
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:53,379
You even hearing like when it flies by very, very faintly at like almost like not even one dB, like minus like 15 dB.

131
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:56,059
That makes the whole scene.

132
00:16:56,059 --> 00:17:04,839
You've seen something that has like had like big rock music behind it and you take the music out and it just looks weird and just looks fucked up.

133
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,839
And just like what the hell am I watching? This looks stupid.

134
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:13,940
Sometimes action sequences without something behind it or really good sound and music mixing.

135
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:22,099
It's kind of like this like looks weird. I don't like I'm watching a movie right now. All right, let's go.

136
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:33,069
It feels empty. Yeah, I don't think I need to change anything.

137
00:17:33,069 --> 00:17:42,430
Let's just go. Okay. I had my delay. I had my stall. It amounted to 15 minutes.

138
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:46,700
Okay, everybody's going to scream at me.

139
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:55,259
Oh, the last thing I did, I just beat that and tested monster thing, whatever it was.

140
00:17:55,259 --> 00:18:10,829
Okay, and now I'll turn the volume up. That should be good.

141
00:18:10,829 --> 00:18:17,269
Let me know if it's better to be where it was last night.

142
00:18:17,269 --> 00:18:21,519
All right, I'm ready to play Dante's Inferno. Free order now.

143
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:35,549
Use the new weapon. I will in like a few years.

144
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:55,140
It's a weird place to be fighting in a few years and a few in game years.

145
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,140
This works kind of like dog years.

146
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:02,140
Every second that you and I are seeing is like in their universe.

147
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:06,140
It's about like two months. You didn't know that.

148
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:10,140
What did you think I was talking about? God damn it.

149
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:28,660
This game takes place in one day.

150
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:32,660
I have you. Have you seen the movie? Did you read the book?

151
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:48,619
I mean, clearly not. Oh, man.

152
00:19:48,619 --> 00:19:53,650
Chill. I'm sorry. I just said something.

153
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:59,220
How am I supposed to respond to that?

154
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:07,009
I'm in a fucked up mood today.

155
00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:12,420
You can always tell when there's a reverse delay.

156
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:15,420
This is a little bit of insider information for you.

157
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:19,789
If I tell you that, oh, hey, reverse delay, I'm streaming today instead.

158
00:20:19,789 --> 00:20:21,970
You need to know that it's because you know what?

159
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:25,970
Today I'm feeling I feel like I am ready today and I'm ready to go right now.

160
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:32,960
I'm in one of those moods. Felt a little froggy. That's right.

161
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,480
Sometimes you just don't. You're not in that mode.

162
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:48,539
All right. Where am I supposed to go here? Down here?

163
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:55,759
I'm not. Am I missing something?

164
00:20:55,759 --> 00:21:00,059
How long do you think you would spend in a bouncy castle?

165
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:14,269
Zero minutes. Wait, hold on. I didn't even see this.

166
00:21:14,269 --> 00:21:18,509
This is a whole nother way to go. I didn't even see it.

167
00:21:18,509 --> 00:21:29,309
No, I want the. All right. If you want the real answer, fine.

168
00:21:29,309 --> 00:21:34,920
How long would I spend in a bouncy castle?

169
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:39,799
What do you guys think is the amount of time that it would be?

170
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:44,869
Hey, there's there's an adult in the bouncy castle

171
00:21:44,869 --> 00:21:53,170
and it's been more than X amount of time.

172
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:57,170
Like, like, hey, like, who is it? Who's in the bouncy castle right now?

173
00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:00,170
Oh, nobody. Just Uncle Frank is in there.

174
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:04,470
Just that's it. Just Uncle Frank went in. OK. All right.

175
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:06,470
All right. Uncle Frank is in there.

176
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:10,470
How long is Uncle Frank allowed to be in there before the family kind of gets together and is like

177
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:13,470
Uncle Frank's been in there for more than X.

178
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:17,589
I think it's probably five minutes.

179
00:22:17,589 --> 00:22:23,950
It's definitely five minutes, two days.

180
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:28,319
Uncle Frank is camping in the bouncy castle.

181
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:43,960
Let him bounce. I need to get that item.

182
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:50,059
Stop being politician, Andy. Just answer the goddamn question, coward.

183
00:22:50,059 --> 00:22:53,059
I am. Not every question.

184
00:22:53,059 --> 00:22:56,059
There needs to be context with this question.

185
00:22:56,059 --> 00:23:05,099
How long would OK. All context removed.

186
00:23:05,099 --> 00:23:10,589
If I if they gave a bouncy castle just teleported behind me and it was just there.

187
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:12,589
OK. How long do you want to be in there for?

188
00:23:12,589 --> 00:23:15,589
I would say 10 minutes there. I answer your question.

189
00:23:15,589 --> 00:23:18,200
Ten minutes total, maybe.

190
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,200
And then you'd be like, OK, I don't want to be in there anymore.

191
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:27,460
I'm done. I just got a new thing.

192
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:32,460
What is that? Oh, I got a new weapon, too. Let's try it.

193
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:42,740
You're really going to stay in there five minutes more than Uncle Frank.

194
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,740
Really? That's kind of not all right.

195
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:48,430
Oh, god damn it. Yeah.

196
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:56,900
How can we get to stay in there?

197
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,900
You all yelled at me when I was in there for five minutes.

198
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,900
You don't see how long Jeremy's been in there for.

199
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,900
How come he gets to stay in there?

200
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:11,099
All right. Well, this is obviously the right thing.

201
00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:21,900
But how does this work? OK.

202
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,839
Tune up. Special stands used to link into certain combo attacks.

203
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:29,839
Press Y while on the ground so that you switch the stance over.

204
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:35,829
Keep the left stick neutral and press Y while in tune up mode.

205
00:24:35,829 --> 00:24:42,809
Devon is super complicated.

206
00:24:42,809 --> 00:24:46,809
You need to dump like 30 K just for it to be functional, and it's super hard to use.

207
00:24:46,809 --> 00:24:54,740
Why is it that every instrument item in every video game is always the coolest one,

208
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:57,740
but it's always the most complicated? You need a PhD to use it one.

209
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:04,650
It always feels like that, doesn't it?

210
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:09,700
Still cool, though. What about the gun?

211
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:14,670
What is this thing? Normal shot.

212
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:23,180
Oh, just kind of like a cannon. How does it work?

213
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:27,380
Ooh, this thing might be good.

214
00:25:27,380 --> 00:26:02,519
All right. Let me just use this enough to do this.

215
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:06,339
Yeah. All right. I got it.

216
00:26:06,339 --> 00:26:08,339
This seems kind of cool.

217
00:26:08,339 --> 00:26:13,849
I have no idea what he's doing.

218
00:26:13,849 --> 00:26:19,779
Oh, you have to have a certain power. I got it.

219
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:22,460
I don't think I want to use it, though.

220
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:29,670
It does seem a little complicated. He seems to get to stand still a lot.

221
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:32,670
Go back to those. Oh, yeah.

222
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:39,029
Ooh, wait a minute. Should I?

223
00:26:39,029 --> 00:26:42,029
Somebody just rocked back in their chair and was like,

224
00:26:42,029 --> 00:26:44,029
Hurry the fuck up.

225
00:26:44,029 --> 00:26:53,500
Go on already. Please.

226
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:57,809
No, no, just play. Please. God.

227
00:26:57,809 --> 00:26:59,809
So what? Let me look at this.

228
00:26:59,809 --> 00:27:03,049
Hmm. I think this is probably kind of good, I think.

229
00:27:03,049 --> 00:27:12,779
I don't know.

230
00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:15,779
Okay, we're going. I'm going. I swear.

231
00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:19,460
I'm going. Look, we're here. We're playing.

232
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:25,009
God damn it. I can't stand it.

233
00:27:25,009 --> 00:27:34,329
And you just got a little too mad, didn't you?

234
00:27:34,329 --> 00:27:36,329
Mom just opened up the fucking door.

235
00:27:36,329 --> 00:27:38,329
Said, You're grounded.

236
00:27:38,329 --> 00:27:41,940
What?

237
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:42,940
Fucking Jerma.

238
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:49,339
Getting me grounded.

239
00:27:49,339 --> 00:27:50,339
Can't go over that.

240
00:27:50,339 --> 00:28:10,259
I can't believe you got me grounded.

241
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:16,619
Have you ever been grounded before?

242
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:19,619
Who hasn't been grounded before? Okay.

243
00:28:19,619 --> 00:28:25,130
Oh, he's a noob.

244
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:33,359
I'm trying to think if my mother or father ever were like,

245
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:35,359
Jeremy, you're grounded.

246
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:39,750
I don't, I don't think so.

247
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:43,339
You're grounded.

248
00:28:43,339 --> 00:28:47,940
Why? Okay. What's happening right now?

249
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:54,460
Are these protected? Is that freedom?

250
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,460
Okay, it is. It is.

251
00:28:55,460 --> 00:29:08,299
These enemies are kind of annoying.

252
00:29:08,299 --> 00:29:13,859
What is my? What?

253
00:29:13,859 --> 00:29:25,180
I didn't even come close.

254
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,180
The lock on circle is also the enemy health bar.

255
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:45,539
It's really good to know.

256
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:55,819
Okay, we're good. Go.

257
00:29:55,819 --> 00:29:58,059
So what's game progress here?

258
00:29:58,059 --> 00:30:17,259
I was here last night already.

259
00:30:17,259 --> 00:30:19,259
I had the camera angles, so scuff.

260
00:30:19,259 --> 00:30:21,259
Because this is a PS2 game.

261
00:30:21,259 --> 00:30:25,819
And it operates under the Mario 64 philosophy of

262
00:30:25,819 --> 00:30:28,819
you can tilt your camera just enough until the game hates you.

263
00:30:28,819 --> 00:30:38,039
Wait, oh, there we go.

264
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:41,039
I can, sometimes I can actually adjust the camera to go behind me,

265
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,039
but it doesn't happen every time.

266
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:46,299
I need to look at the map for a sec.

267
00:30:46,299 --> 00:30:53,880
Where am I, where am I actually supposed to be going?

268
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:58,059
Because all the way down here is where I killed that lady was here.

269
00:30:58,059 --> 00:31:01,740
Alright, so where to now?

270
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:04,740
Back to the main hallway and go in one of these doors in the middle.

271
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:10,059
I guess just keep going.

272
00:31:10,059 --> 00:31:17,390
There's a map. There is a map, but I don't.

273
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:19,390
There's two doors I haven't gone in, right?

274
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:21,950
In the top left and top right of the circle here.

275
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:28,029
He hates streaming.

276
00:31:28,029 --> 00:31:37,630
This game's classic.

277
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,630
I'm just going to go in this, where am I?

278
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:44,519
What do I end up in here?

279
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:47,519
Okay, so now if I go up, I'll be back in that big room.

280
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,529
Did you get grounded for taking your whole PC into the bathroom?

281
00:31:51,529 --> 00:31:55,750
Um, no.

282
00:31:55,750 --> 00:32:01,410
Where am I now?

283
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:03,990
Okay, yep.

284
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:04,990
Let's keep going.

285
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:24,690
No, I didn't get grounded for that.

286
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:25,690
I'm not going to hit me.

287
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:40,150
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

288
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:55,819
Is there shit out of me here?

289
00:32:55,819 --> 00:33:06,890
Everything just jumps away from me.

290
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:12,880
I go to attack something and it just leaps across the whole map.

291
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:30,099
God, just die already.

292
00:33:30,099 --> 00:33:39,210
Stop.

293
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:45,480
Set the game on easy already.

294
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:50,859
Hey, I've made it to Chapter 10 on normal in six hours.

295
00:33:50,859 --> 00:33:58,660
I'm good, I'm good.

296
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:03,210
Okay, here we go.

297
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:04,210
Special power.

298
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:05,210
Oh, shit.

299
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,210
I didn't get the special power?

300
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:10,730
Did I really not get the special power?

301
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:18,659
It will be under items.

302
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:26,179
Stone mask?

303
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:27,179
What is this?

304
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:31,230
It's not it.

305
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,730
So where does this go?

306
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:37,079
Part rivers.

307
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:39,219
Is there...

308
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:42,219
I need to use that at a waterfall or something?

309
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:49,860
That would make sense.

310
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:56,789
Part water.

311
00:34:56,789 --> 00:35:13,119
From here, I go up this way.

312
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:14,119
That's where I need to go?

313
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:15,940
Yes.

314
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:21,889
Here, the water.

315
00:35:21,889 --> 00:35:27,500
There's water here.

316
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,730
No, wait.

317
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:31,730
Why am I...

318
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:32,730
Really?

319
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:37,860
I wish the indicator on the map showed where I was actually standing.

320
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:43,380
Because that yellow indicator to me is like, oh, that's where you currently are standing.

321
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,070
But it's...

322
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:47,019
Is it?

323
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:48,019
It's kind of like...

324
00:35:48,019 --> 00:35:55,849
I don't know, it's weird.

325
00:35:55,849 --> 00:35:59,389
Go this way?

326
00:35:59,389 --> 00:36:00,389
No.

327
00:36:00,389 --> 00:36:02,389
So is it this door back here?

328
00:36:02,389 --> 00:36:04,389
I'm just trying to get to the middle room again.

329
00:36:04,389 --> 00:36:09,039
I want to get into the middle room because there's two doors I haven't tried to open.

330
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:11,039
But this is weird.

331
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:12,039
Why can I not do this?

332
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:20,099
Because that's the only door that is listed here.

333
00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:22,099
But is there one here?

334
00:36:22,099 --> 00:36:28,250
This is where I came from.

335
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:29,250
So I should...

336
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:31,250
If I go in this door, I should be in this spot.

337
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:34,659
Okay.

338
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:37,929
So this door should connect to the...

339
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:43,860
But I can't go this way because I need the elevator to go that way.

340
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:44,860
Or that...

341
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:45,860
Open this door.

342
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:48,159
I need to go all the way around to go through here?

343
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:50,159
Somebody just tell me where to go.

344
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:51,159
I have no idea where I'm going.

345
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:56,019
Because I wanted to get to this middle room, but I can't go that way.

346
00:36:56,019 --> 00:36:59,019
So do I have to go all the way around and walk all the way around?

347
00:36:59,019 --> 00:37:06,469
No, help.

348
00:37:06,469 --> 00:37:07,469
No, yes, help.

349
00:37:07,469 --> 00:37:08,469
Help me.

350
00:37:08,469 --> 00:37:13,170
Play the game.

351
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:14,170
Yeah, it's a PS2 game though.

352
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:17,170
Sometimes it's just like, oh, find this random obscure thing that is good.

353
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:19,170
You're going to walk around for 40 minutes to find it.

354
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:29,429
Wait.

355
00:37:29,429 --> 00:37:30,429
I am in here.

356
00:37:30,429 --> 00:37:33,400
Hold on.

357
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,400
But I can't...

358
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,340
Okay.

359
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,340
Yeah.

360
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:44,090
I cannot go this way.

361
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:45,090
So I just have to go all the...

362
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:47,090
I should just literally restart the save file.

363
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:55,980
It's the place before the boss fight.

364
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,219
Yeah, but I picked up the mask.

365
00:37:57,219 --> 00:37:59,219
Where does the mask even go?

366
00:37:59,219 --> 00:38:02,099
I guess I'm just going to go all the way around.

367
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:08,139
Whatever.

368
00:38:08,139 --> 00:38:10,139
You're too busy talking about bouncy castles?

369
00:38:10,139 --> 00:38:16,099
Not really though.

370
00:38:16,099 --> 00:38:20,619
I got item B.

371
00:38:20,619 --> 00:38:25,619
I need to place item B into pedestal X.

372
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:28,619
But I don't know where pedestal X is.

373
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:48,820
The long and short of it.

374
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,820
It's back where you missed the guitar.

375
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,699
So I just have to go all the way back around.

376
00:38:53,699 --> 00:38:56,989
Okay.

377
00:38:56,989 --> 00:39:08,340
All right.

378
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,340
So this is water.

379
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:12,989
I mean, there's only literally...

380
00:39:12,989 --> 00:39:14,989
There's only literally two places where I could go do this.

381
00:39:14,989 --> 00:39:16,989
So I guess let's see if it's in here.

382
00:39:16,989 --> 00:39:24,179
Can't like...

383
00:39:24,179 --> 00:39:27,179
Can't it be like the water or something to go over there?

384
00:39:27,179 --> 00:39:37,809
It has to be right here.

385
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:44,809
It worked.

386
00:39:44,809 --> 00:39:52,130
Is that not correct?

387
00:39:52,130 --> 00:40:03,519
500 IQ.

388
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:07,820
I mean, there's no indication of where I'm supposed to go.

389
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:10,130
It just says, here you got an item.

390
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:28,500
The white glowing wall in this room?

391
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:33,739
I thought this was a statue.

392
00:40:33,739 --> 00:40:39,289
Other lights like this have existed.

393
00:40:39,289 --> 00:40:44,289
This white light here was in like a dozen other rooms.

394
00:40:44,289 --> 00:40:46,489
Give me a break.

395
00:40:46,489 --> 00:40:54,030
We've walked by statues like that a dozen times already.

396
00:40:54,030 --> 00:41:11,500
That would be the 13th time then.

397
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:16,769
That light has shown up a thousand times.

398
00:41:16,769 --> 00:41:19,030
Okay.

399
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:20,030
This is for the main bridge.

400
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:27,349
It's a granny game.

401
00:41:27,349 --> 00:41:30,420
It's not a granny game.

402
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:38,230
So the main bridge is the one...

403
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:44,210
I don't think that...

404
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,210
Was there a spot I could put this in?

405
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:49,750
Milk brain.

406
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:53,550
It is a granny-like.

407
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:56,860
It kind of actually is a granny-like, but there's just nothing chasing me.

408
00:41:56,860 --> 00:42:04,329
So I already got this one.

409
00:42:04,329 --> 00:42:06,329
Where's the main bridge?

410
00:42:06,329 --> 00:42:10,380
Does it say it on it?

411
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:13,559
The rotating bridge is in there.

412
00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:15,820
So I just have to go back.

413
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,820
Is that where that thing goes?

414
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,820
That's where I couldn't power the device before?

415
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:20,820
Whatever it was.

416
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:24,730
And am I even going the right way?

417
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:27,730
I just don't even know what direction north or south even is.

418
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:29,730
I wish I had a compass or something.

419
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:30,730
Give me a compass.

420
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:33,730
Give me any indication of what direction I'm facing.

421
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:39,699
Okay.

422
00:42:39,699 --> 00:42:40,699
And all the way around.

423
00:42:40,699 --> 00:43:02,960
How did you forget already?

424
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:09,929
Because putting short-term into long-term memory is almost impossible for me to do.

425
00:43:09,929 --> 00:43:15,110
It is very difficult.

426
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:18,110
With no guide system.

427
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:23,110
It's actually really hard for me to put into longer-term memory.

428
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:26,480
Especially when it's a very similar-looking landscape.

429
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,480
It's actually pretty hard for me to do.

430
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,090
Okay.

431
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:33,090
But we are there now.

432
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:44,440
I just have to go this way, right?

433
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:48,619
Because that...

434
00:43:48,619 --> 00:43:49,619
Yes, it's this way, right?

435
00:43:49,619 --> 00:43:53,360
Yes.

436
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,360
Because of the spider room.

437
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,360
And you fight the spiders.

438
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,360
And you go this way.

439
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,360
All right.

440
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:01,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

441
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:05,679
Also too, you can blame the video game industry.

442
00:44:05,679 --> 00:44:10,679
Because the video game industry in the last 10 to 20 years has made it impossible for you to not know where you're going.

443
00:44:10,679 --> 00:44:18,610
So when that's what you're used to for decades after this kind of concept here.

444
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:22,610
The video game industry now is just like, make sure that they have absolutely...

445
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:24,610
They cannot get lost no matter what.

446
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:30,260
Back 20 years ago, it was like, good luck, you fucking dumbass.

447
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:33,690
You got to remember where that ball goes.

448
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:47,980
That was...

449
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:49,980
Yeah, I just realized how he just did that.

450
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:51,610
All right, so it can be moved.

451
00:44:51,610 --> 00:45:03,659
All right, let's go.

452
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:19,750
Hey, we made it.

453
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:22,750
It only took us like 30 minutes to get to this next part.

454
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,719
He butchered innocent people too.

455
00:46:05,719 --> 00:46:08,719
He's the most vile kind of creature.

456
00:46:21,559 --> 00:46:22,559
Yahoo!

457
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:37,860
We have something in common.

458
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:39,860
I have a dysfunctional family too.

459
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:41,860
And what would you know about family?

460
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:43,860
You're a demon.

461
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:46,610
This is my father.

462
00:46:46,610 --> 00:46:48,980
My family.

463
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:51,980
This was all supposed to end by my hand.

464
00:46:51,980 --> 00:47:09,579
How are they missing at point blank range?

465
00:47:09,579 --> 00:47:11,199
Aren't you going to shoot?

466
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:14,340
It's kind of a Capcom thing, isn't it?

467
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:15,340
That's a switch.

468
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:16,340
Like they do that frequently.

469
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:20,710
I don't care anymore.

470
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:39,739
Jesus, that was so much louder.

471
00:47:39,739 --> 00:47:40,739
All right, well, that's going to be high.

472
00:47:40,739 --> 00:47:42,739
And we knew that was going to be high.

473
00:47:42,739 --> 00:47:45,920
Oh, that's bad.

474
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,059
No, this doesn't count.

475
00:47:48,059 --> 00:47:52,059
This is an issue because I didn't end the chapter.

476
00:47:52,059 --> 00:47:55,059
All right, listen, it's really important.

477
00:47:55,059 --> 00:47:56,679
I didn't end the chapter.

478
00:47:56,679 --> 00:47:58,679
When we played last night, I beat the boss.

479
00:47:58,679 --> 00:48:00,679
I didn't end the chapter.

480
00:48:00,679 --> 00:48:02,679
I just kept running.

481
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:04,679
That's why it was an issue here.

482
00:48:04,679 --> 00:48:05,679
Okay.

483
00:48:05,679 --> 00:48:08,710
Won't happen again.

484
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:23,110
You're still alive, I see.

485
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:29,320
Is that you?

486
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,260
What's happening?

487
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:34,269
Where's your mother?

488
00:48:34,269 --> 00:48:35,510
Mother?

489
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:37,820
You killed her, remember?

490
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:42,469
Yes, that's right.

491
00:48:42,469 --> 00:48:59,780
The thing I've done was to succumb to his influence.

492
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:03,780
This is what it's going to be like when we have more microplastics in our blood.

493
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:19,480
True.

494
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:27,670
He's attempting to bring the demon world back.

495
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:31,829
The world that Sparda once sealed off.

496
00:49:31,829 --> 00:49:35,210
Sparda thought he was a myth.

497
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:36,210
Flot twist?

498
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:37,639
What the fuck?

499
00:49:37,639 --> 00:49:43,639
I thought he was the bad guy.

500
00:49:43,639 --> 00:49:44,639
Stop him.

501
00:49:44,639 --> 00:50:02,750
I one regret his talking in an evil voice and wearing evil clothes.

502
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:11,369
If only I presented myself differently.

503
00:50:11,369 --> 00:50:49,449
All right, let's go.

504
00:50:49,449 --> 00:50:51,449
Time for revenge.

505
00:50:51,449 --> 00:50:54,969
All right, make sure I check my surroundings.

506
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:55,969
Lock it in a memory.

507
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:56,969
Get it in a long-term memory.

508
00:50:56,969 --> 00:50:58,969
That hallway was right there.

509
00:50:58,969 --> 00:51:03,699
I am now facing south in this room.

510
00:51:03,699 --> 00:51:04,699
There's only one of the door.

511
00:51:04,699 --> 00:51:05,699
It's not this one on the left side.

512
00:51:05,699 --> 00:51:06,699
You've got it.

513
00:51:06,699 --> 00:51:13,769
I don't know where I am.

514
00:51:13,769 --> 00:51:34,289
Okay, cool.

515
00:51:34,289 --> 00:51:38,909
Can I do anything with this spherical device here?

516
00:51:38,909 --> 00:51:45,739
Why did you play Resident Evil 4 on normal and not hardcore?

517
00:51:45,739 --> 00:51:46,739
You still on that?

518
00:51:46,739 --> 00:51:50,130
You still upset by that?

519
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:55,590
I don't know.

520
00:51:55,590 --> 00:52:01,860
I wanted it to be an approachable kind of challenging, but not really.

521
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,860
But focus on the game.

522
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:04,860
I don't know.

523
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:05,860
That felt like it.

524
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:06,860
How does that sound?

525
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:21,090
I'm not upset.

526
00:52:21,090 --> 00:52:22,090
I'm just disappointed.

527
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:25,820
Yeah.

528
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:26,820
Well, it's going to be fine.

529
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:27,820
Don't worry.

530
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:28,820
Because I'm going to first try this boss.

531
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:34,409
I'm going to look over and see a ton of Pog use.

532
00:52:34,409 --> 00:52:36,409
It's going to be crazy.

533
00:52:36,409 --> 00:53:05,059
Where are you coming?

534
00:53:05,059 --> 00:53:13,409
That's the way to deal with these.

535
00:53:13,409 --> 00:53:14,650
Just shoot them.

536
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:29,199
Oh, doesn't.

537
00:53:29,199 --> 00:53:31,199
Don't you just want to make the devil mad?

538
00:53:31,199 --> 00:53:37,730
Oh, doesn't it just make the devil mad?

539
00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:43,139
Freakish looking faces are etched into the statue.

540
00:53:43,139 --> 00:53:47,710
Center face is tears of blood streaming down its face.

541
00:53:47,710 --> 00:53:50,619
All right.

542
00:53:50,619 --> 00:53:52,619
The middle one has tears of blood.

543
00:53:52,619 --> 00:53:54,619
Where are we standing right now?

544
00:53:54,619 --> 00:53:55,980
We are in this room.

545
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:58,980
This room is the one with the bloody eye statue.

546
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:04,219
Bloody eye statue in this room that has these six on it.

547
00:54:04,219 --> 00:54:23,099
Are we looking for a bloody eye statue?

548
00:54:23,099 --> 00:54:26,329
I would guess.

549
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:30,380
Can I do anything with this?

550
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:35,949
Does one of these have tears of blood?

551
00:54:35,949 --> 00:54:41,099
I don't see it.

552
00:54:41,099 --> 00:54:42,849
Be up.

553
00:54:42,849 --> 00:54:49,590
How do I run up walls?

554
00:54:49,590 --> 00:55:06,139
I know I can, right?

555
00:55:06,139 --> 00:55:17,969
This is like sticking out.

556
00:55:17,969 --> 00:55:40,179
Oh, I'm looking for bloody eyes.

557
00:55:40,179 --> 00:55:42,179
I wasn't looking for a place to jump up.

558
00:55:42,179 --> 00:55:54,170
Oh, I found it.

559
00:55:54,170 --> 00:55:56,170
It takes a second.

560
00:55:56,170 --> 00:56:00,989
Can I push?

561
00:56:00,989 --> 00:56:05,300
Can these be broken?

562
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:20,369
There are two doors.

563
00:56:20,369 --> 00:56:24,360
OK.

564
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:27,179
This door is a little too small for me.

565
00:56:27,179 --> 00:56:29,179
I have to push it into that door.

566
00:56:29,179 --> 00:56:32,909
Can you push?

567
00:56:32,909 --> 00:56:47,079
There's one over here.

568
00:56:47,079 --> 00:56:49,730
OK.

569
00:56:49,730 --> 00:56:50,730
What?

570
00:56:50,730 --> 00:56:52,539
What?

571
00:56:52,539 --> 00:56:53,539
I just tried to do that with the other one.

572
00:56:53,539 --> 00:57:15,360
This is a PS2 video game and you tell me it doesn't have the lean the shoulder down animation

573
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:21,139
that goes pushing something.

574
00:57:21,139 --> 00:57:44,980
I hope I've got this lined up right.

575
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:51,500
Mind bending puzzles.

576
00:57:51,500 --> 00:58:22,030
I love the earth exploding rat movie 2 sound effect.

577
00:58:22,030 --> 00:58:52,670
Where's my style?

578
00:58:52,670 --> 00:58:56,789
Sweet.

579
00:58:56,789 --> 00:58:57,789
Oh, what?

580
00:58:57,789 --> 00:59:08,570
Oh, I accidentally.

581
00:59:08,570 --> 00:59:12,639
Is that the pizza tower orphan of cost scream?

582
00:59:12,639 --> 00:59:14,639
I don't think it is.

583
00:59:14,639 --> 00:59:19,780
Maybe it is.

584
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:24,289
OK.

585
00:59:24,289 --> 00:59:25,289
I don't.

586
00:59:25,289 --> 00:59:30,239
I don't think it is.

587
00:59:30,239 --> 00:59:32,059
Where are we?

588
00:59:32,059 --> 00:59:33,059
OK.

589
00:59:33,059 --> 00:59:34,619
We're still in this room.

590
00:59:34,619 --> 00:59:39,420
Another part of it, too, is going room two, room three, room four without looking at the

591
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:40,420
map.

592
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:42,420
So then it's like I don't put into memory where I even am.

593
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:43,420
But I'm doing that now.

594
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:44,420
Look, I'm getting better.

595
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:51,420
How's the audio?

596
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:52,420
Do audio need to be dropped like 5 percent?

597
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:58,139
We good?

598
00:59:58,139 --> 00:59:59,309
A little loud?

599
00:59:59,309 --> 01:00:14,380
Is it all?

600
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:15,380
We good?

601
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:16,380
Can't wait to.

602
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:18,320
Oh, I wanted that.

603
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:19,320
OK.

604
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:47,179
Can't wait for Bugleberry the musical to come out.

605
01:00:47,179 --> 01:01:17,670
Stop.

606
01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:18,670
Sing the song.

607
01:01:18,670 --> 01:01:21,849
Uh, this one that goes.

608
01:01:21,849 --> 01:01:22,849
Yeah.

609
01:01:22,849 --> 01:01:23,849
Yeah.

610
01:01:23,849 --> 01:01:24,849
I was the one that you wanted.

611
01:01:24,849 --> 01:01:25,849
Yeah.

612
01:01:25,849 --> 01:01:26,849
Yeah.

613
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:29,849
I'm a super beast.

614
01:01:29,849 --> 01:01:57,519
Nice.

615
01:01:57,519 --> 01:02:12,690
This game looks like it's kind of fun.

616
01:02:12,690 --> 01:02:13,690
I would agree with you.

617
01:02:13,690 --> 01:02:14,690
I think this game is kind of fun.

618
01:02:14,690 --> 01:02:16,820
You can check it out.

619
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:24,079
How come?

620
01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:25,079
Why is it?

621
01:02:25,079 --> 01:02:28,219
You know what I'm really not happy with?

622
01:02:28,219 --> 01:02:31,519
Cerberus only has two upgrades.

623
01:02:31,519 --> 01:02:34,519
Everything else gets three.

624
01:02:34,519 --> 01:02:36,519
Some some get four.

625
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:39,659
What's up with that?

626
01:02:39,659 --> 01:02:52,460
What's up with that?

627
01:02:52,460 --> 01:02:54,699
Change the sword master.

628
01:02:54,699 --> 01:02:57,880
I'm going to lose my dodge, but it's all right.

629
01:02:57,880 --> 01:02:59,880
I think I've gotten used to the A dodge.

630
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:01,880
I think I'm OK with using it.

631
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:05,590
It's front loaded because it's the second weapon.

632
01:03:05,590 --> 01:03:06,590
That makes sense.

633
01:03:06,590 --> 01:03:08,409
All right.

634
01:03:08,409 --> 01:03:09,409
What now?

635
01:03:09,409 --> 01:03:10,409
Does that change what I can do?

636
01:03:10,409 --> 01:03:14,949
If I go into my.

637
01:03:14,949 --> 01:03:15,949
Where is it here?

638
01:03:15,949 --> 01:03:19,219
What menu is it under?

639
01:03:19,219 --> 01:03:25,869
So does that add anything to Cerberus?

640
01:03:25,869 --> 01:03:34,019
Yes, I do that all the time.

641
01:03:34,019 --> 01:03:38,739
I do this all the time.

642
01:03:38,739 --> 01:03:41,579
Yep.

643
01:03:41,579 --> 01:03:44,139
Windmill satellite.

644
01:03:44,139 --> 01:03:49,360
Spin your nunchucks around your body, devastating all enemies around you.

645
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:53,420
Ooh.

646
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:57,960
What's the type two combo for Cerberus?

647
01:03:57,960 --> 01:03:58,960
Why?

648
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,139
Why?

649
01:04:00,139 --> 01:04:01,139
Pause.

650
01:04:01,139 --> 01:04:04,739
Why?

651
01:04:04,739 --> 01:04:06,500
Why?

652
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:07,500
OK.

653
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:08,500
So why?

654
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:09,500
Why?

655
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:14,380
Pause.

656
01:04:14,380 --> 01:04:15,380
Why?

657
01:04:15,380 --> 01:04:16,380
Why?

658
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:17,380
Why?

659
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:19,820
Why?

660
01:04:19,820 --> 01:04:20,820
Why?

661
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:22,059
Why?

662
01:04:22,059 --> 01:04:25,349
Why?

663
01:04:25,349 --> 01:04:26,349
Why?

664
01:04:26,349 --> 01:04:28,349
Ah, yeah, ah, ah.

665
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:32,260
Ha ha ha.

666
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:33,260
Ha ha.

667
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:34,260
Ha.

668
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:35,260
Enough.

669
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:36,260
Ahh.

670
01:04:36,260 --> 01:04:37,260
There it is.

671
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:38,260
OK.

672
01:04:38,260 --> 01:04:47,739
So the pause is actually pretty long, tell you what.

673
01:04:47,739 --> 01:04:48,739
Yeah, yeah.

674
01:04:48,739 --> 01:04:49,739
So it's boom.

675
01:04:49,739 --> 01:04:50,739
Boom boom.

676
01:04:50,739 --> 01:04:51,739
Boom boom boom boom.

677
01:04:51,739 --> 01:04:52,739
suite.

678
01:04:52,739 --> 01:04:53,739
Four of course.

679
01:04:53,739 --> 01:05:00,289
Boom.

680
01:05:00,289 --> 01:05:01,289
So what does that one do?

681
01:05:01,289 --> 01:05:02,780
That's the style button.

682
01:05:02,780 --> 01:05:05,500
Right as circle.

683
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:06,500
Oh.

684
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:23,519
That's what I'm doing.

685
01:05:23,519 --> 01:05:24,519
An angel.

686
01:05:24,519 --> 01:05:35,460
Br марe you need to do that, boy.

687
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:39,949
I'll tell you what, next time I'll try and wear some cologne, okay?

688
01:05:39,949 --> 01:05:41,949
It's the stench of betrayal.

689
01:05:41,949 --> 01:05:43,949
The odor of that accursed sport.

690
01:05:43,949 --> 01:05:46,949
I love voices like this and it's like half the characters in the game.

691
01:05:46,949 --> 01:05:53,670
I want to do these voices.

692
01:05:53,670 --> 01:06:08,519
Oh, I don't have a dodge roll.

693
01:06:08,519 --> 01:06:10,519
I'm trying to dodge roll around this.

694
01:06:10,519 --> 01:06:11,519
Whoops.

695
01:06:11,519 --> 01:06:51,349
Oh shit, what?

696
01:06:51,349 --> 01:06:53,659
He hit me with his stun.

697
01:06:53,659 --> 01:07:06,260
I stunned him and it hurt me.

698
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:08,949
Oops.

699
01:07:08,949 --> 01:07:12,949
Alright, so I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.

700
01:07:13,949 --> 01:07:22,630
It's actually kind of hard to do those super combos during bosses.

701
01:07:22,630 --> 01:07:24,869
Because they kind of just hit you out of them.

702
01:07:24,869 --> 01:07:41,869
Alright, I think I did alright for a first try.

703
01:07:41,869 --> 01:07:42,869
Let's go.

704
01:07:42,869 --> 01:08:01,650
Dammit.

705
01:08:01,650 --> 01:08:26,119
Sorry.

706
01:08:26,119 --> 01:08:38,180
Let's go!

707
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:39,180
Oh shit.

708
01:08:39,180 --> 01:08:40,739
Oh!

709
01:08:40,739 --> 01:08:42,300
What's he doing?

710
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:43,300
What the fuck are you doing?

711
01:08:43,300 --> 01:08:44,300
Oh my god.

712
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:45,859
Jesus!

713
01:08:45,859 --> 01:08:55,670
Ow.

714
01:08:55,670 --> 01:08:59,979
Whoa!

715
01:08:59,979 --> 01:09:05,130
Geez.

716
01:09:05,130 --> 01:09:16,479
Oh my god, that's a huge area.

717
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:21,149
You just have to run.

718
01:09:21,149 --> 01:09:28,340
I'm dead.

719
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:30,609
Okay.

720
01:09:30,609 --> 01:09:33,779
Alright, so his phase two, he says crush.

721
01:09:33,779 --> 01:09:37,779
And then a gigantic AOE explosion happens underneath his feet.

722
01:09:37,779 --> 01:09:45,619
You gotta be careful.

723
01:09:45,619 --> 01:09:50,609
One weapon, Andy.

724
01:09:50,609 --> 01:09:53,609
Let's not start switching around before I know his moves.

725
01:09:53,609 --> 01:10:00,539
That shouldn't hurt you.

726
01:10:00,539 --> 01:10:03,300
That shouldn't hurt you.

727
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:06,300
He's staggered and his arms can be...

728
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:09,300
His LEDs on his arms hurt you.

729
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:43,180
Alright, here we go.

730
01:10:43,180 --> 01:11:03,510
Here comes his bullshit.

731
01:11:03,510 --> 01:11:04,510
No jump!

732
01:11:08,609 --> 01:11:11,510
Watch out!

733
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:12,510
Stop jump!

734
01:11:12,510 --> 01:11:27,770
What the fuck?

735
01:11:27,770 --> 01:11:33,680
Stop jumping, man!

736
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:42,039
Get me out of the corner!

737
01:11:42,039 --> 01:11:43,920
No!

738
01:11:43,920 --> 01:12:00,840
Try to get that range.

739
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:01,840
Oh, it sucks.

740
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:02,840
God damn it.

741
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:03,840
What?

742
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:04,840
Oh, it's alright.

743
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:05,840
When you lock on and you do the Diablo walk.

744
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:06,840
I just want to get in there, but I have to do the Diablo walk.

745
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:07,840
Oh shit!

746
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:26,739
I tried to dodge, but I had my button.

747
01:12:26,739 --> 01:12:27,739
My hand was on like four different buttons.

748
01:12:27,739 --> 01:12:39,670
Oh shit!

749
01:12:39,670 --> 01:12:40,670
Oh shit!

750
01:12:40,670 --> 01:12:41,670
Oh shit!

751
01:12:41,670 --> 01:12:42,670
Oh shit!

752
01:12:42,670 --> 01:12:43,670
Oh shit!

753
01:12:43,670 --> 01:12:44,670
Oh shit!

754
01:12:44,670 --> 01:12:45,670
Oh shit!

755
01:12:45,670 --> 01:13:41,119
Oh shit!

756
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:42,119
Oh shit!

757
01:13:42,119 --> 01:13:43,119
I tried to dodge, but I had my button.

758
01:13:43,119 --> 01:13:45,119
My hand was on like four different buttons.

759
01:13:45,119 --> 01:13:46,119
Fuck no!

760
01:13:46,119 --> 01:13:49,119
I'm throwing it so hard now.

761
01:13:49,119 --> 01:13:50,119
I was actually...

762
01:13:50,119 --> 01:13:52,119
My fingers were on four different buttons.

763
01:13:52,119 --> 01:13:53,119
I couldn't dodge.

764
01:13:53,119 --> 01:13:55,680
Oh my god.

765
01:13:55,680 --> 01:14:04,600
I had...

766
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:07,600
I had my index finger holding right trigger.

767
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,600
My left finger is on the stick.

768
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:12,600
I have to press left trigger to switch to this other weapon.

769
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:14,600
I have to then press right trigger.

770
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:16,600
I've got one, two, three, four...

771
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:23,890
I've got five buttons being pressed at the same time.

772
01:14:23,890 --> 01:14:24,890
Start it over.

773
01:14:24,890 --> 01:14:32,609
I'm playing Bop It with Devil May Cry in my hands.

774
01:14:32,609 --> 01:14:39,029
That was such a good start too.

775
01:14:39,029 --> 01:14:40,029
I threw it away.

776
01:14:40,029 --> 01:14:41,029
I just threw it in the trash.

777
01:14:41,029 --> 01:14:57,630
That shouldn't hit you.

778
01:14:57,630 --> 01:14:58,630
They should patch it.

779
01:14:58,630 --> 01:15:01,279
They should patch the game.

780
01:15:01,279 --> 01:15:02,279
God damn it.

781
01:15:02,279 --> 01:15:03,279
What?

782
01:15:03,279 --> 01:15:52,069
Such an awful camera for this to be right now.

783
01:15:52,069 --> 01:15:53,069
Please change it.

784
01:15:53,069 --> 01:15:54,500
How do I make sure...

785
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:55,500
How do I force this to happen?

786
01:15:55,500 --> 01:16:02,630
I have to just get him in this corner.

787
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:03,630
I jumped over it.

788
01:16:04,630 --> 01:16:10,350
It's killing me.

789
01:16:10,350 --> 01:16:11,659
It's killing me.

790
01:16:11,659 --> 01:16:17,439
I'm starting over.

791
01:16:17,439 --> 01:16:21,439
I feel like I'm going to eventually be pressing every single button on the controller and

792
01:16:21,439 --> 01:16:23,439
I'm going to get an error message from Microsoft.

793
01:16:23,439 --> 01:16:29,060
I'm going to hold left trigger, left bumper, then his right bumper, right trigger, Y, X,

794
01:16:29,060 --> 01:16:31,060
and B at the same time.

795
01:16:31,060 --> 01:16:32,060
And it's going to go...

796
01:16:32,060 --> 01:16:42,329
And it's going to turn my fucking computer off.

797
01:16:42,329 --> 01:16:45,329
I'm accidentally going to hit start and then press that combination and it's going to reset

798
01:16:45,329 --> 01:17:24,789
the game like these old games used to do.

799
01:17:24,789 --> 01:17:25,789
Turn this camera.

800
01:17:25,789 --> 01:17:27,789
Turn this camera around now.

801
01:17:27,789 --> 01:17:35,470
I hate that move.

802
01:17:35,470 --> 01:17:36,470
It's so unfair.

803
01:17:41,939 --> 01:17:42,939
Start over.

804
01:17:42,939 --> 01:17:55,890
Please just do it.

805
01:17:55,890 --> 01:18:02,930
The devil trigger heals.

806
01:18:02,930 --> 01:18:05,319
Not very much.

807
01:18:05,319 --> 01:18:15,090
I got to get to phase two with like 80% health.

808
01:18:15,090 --> 01:18:17,090
Press R3 to reset your camera.

809
01:18:17,090 --> 01:18:19,090
Yeah, it doesn't work half the time though.

810
01:18:19,090 --> 01:18:25,609
I feel like it works when I'm out of combat, but when in combat it just doesn't work anymore.

811
01:18:25,609 --> 01:18:26,609
I've been trying to do it.

812
01:18:26,609 --> 01:18:37,380
What?

813
01:18:37,380 --> 01:19:18,859
No, it does it every time.

814
01:19:18,859 --> 01:19:27,520
All right, we're good.

815
01:19:43,140 --> 01:19:44,380
Jump.

816
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:45,380
What?

817
01:19:49,939 --> 01:19:50,939
Oh my God.

818
01:19:50,939 --> 01:19:52,939
It's so unbearable.

819
01:19:52,939 --> 01:20:30,689
What the fuck?

820
01:20:30,689 --> 01:20:31,689
All right, here we go.

821
01:20:31,689 --> 01:20:48,859
What's that?

822
01:20:48,859 --> 01:20:49,859
What the fuck?

823
01:20:49,859 --> 01:20:50,859
What is that?

824
01:20:50,859 --> 01:20:52,859
What does that move?

825
01:20:52,859 --> 01:20:54,859
Oh my God.

826
01:20:54,859 --> 01:20:55,859
Okay.

827
01:20:55,859 --> 01:21:12,739
Do I have any heals?

828
01:21:12,739 --> 01:21:13,739
What does this do?

829
01:21:13,739 --> 01:21:20,680
Do I need more of these?

830
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:27,170
I have.

831
01:21:27,170 --> 01:21:28,170
Okay.

832
01:21:28,170 --> 01:21:29,170
I've got heals.

833
01:21:29,170 --> 01:21:31,500
I'm doing it.

834
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:39,010
It's not my inventory.

835
01:21:39,010 --> 01:21:40,010
So, but okay.

836
01:21:40,010 --> 01:21:47,300
If you can't use this item right now, it does not have heals.

837
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:48,300
It does not have heals.

838
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:51,020
Okay.

839
01:21:51,020 --> 01:21:53,020
Devil star just refills ET.

840
01:21:53,020 --> 01:21:54,020
Okay.

841
01:21:54,020 --> 01:21:55,640
So, just use it.

842
01:21:55,640 --> 01:21:56,939
Do a crazy combo.

843
01:21:56,939 --> 01:21:57,939
Use it.

844
01:21:57,939 --> 01:21:58,939
Do it.

845
01:21:58,939 --> 01:22:11,060
Just train it together.

846
01:22:11,060 --> 01:22:16,140
I'm buying this.

847
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:21,850
I'm buying it again.

848
01:22:21,850 --> 01:22:23,850
I'm buying it again.

849
01:22:23,850 --> 01:22:33,020
Did that just potentially fix everything?

850
01:22:33,020 --> 01:22:36,029
That's a lot more than I had before.

851
01:22:36,029 --> 01:22:39,189
Finally.

852
01:22:39,189 --> 01:22:40,189
Holy shit.

853
01:22:40,189 --> 01:22:43,189
I thought, I thought everyone was yelling at me not to buy things from the item menu.

854
01:22:43,189 --> 01:22:47,189
I thought it was only for, only put it in your moves and weapons.

855
01:22:47,189 --> 01:22:49,189
I thought I was going to be stupid for doing that.

856
01:22:49,189 --> 01:22:51,189
I thought everyone was going to make fun of me.

857
01:22:51,189 --> 01:22:52,189
Shit.

858
01:22:52,189 --> 01:23:39,270
Oh, that was a stupid mistake from me.

859
01:23:39,270 --> 01:23:57,789
And yep.

860
01:23:57,789 --> 01:23:59,220
All right.

861
01:23:59,220 --> 01:24:19,279
Let's go.

862
01:24:19,279 --> 01:24:20,279
What?

863
01:24:20,279 --> 01:24:22,279
Do you just, how do you get away from that?

864
01:24:22,279 --> 01:24:24,279
Does that move completely unavoidable?

865
01:24:24,279 --> 01:24:34,859
Oh my God.

866
01:24:34,859 --> 01:24:35,859
This is so bad.

867
01:24:35,859 --> 01:24:38,859
I have to hold down to dodge in that angle.

868
01:24:38,859 --> 01:24:43,680
Contextually needing to pick a different direction to dodge to get it to do the right dodge.

869
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:45,680
Oh, it's making me want to puke.

870
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:56,550
So to dodge, you have to, you have to, you have to dodge laterally.

871
01:24:56,550 --> 01:25:04,979
So if the camera is not behind you, a lot of times you have to hit down and A to do a lateral dodge versus left and right and A.

872
01:25:04,979 --> 01:25:09,539
Or it just changes constantly to do a lateral dodge.

873
01:25:09,539 --> 01:25:16,010
What the heck?

874
01:25:16,010 --> 01:25:22,819
To do this, to do what I'm doing here, I have to like press down, but sometimes when you press down, you do a backflip.

875
01:25:22,819 --> 01:25:27,819
Because your character turned around and you were locked on and the camera didn't turn around with you.

876
01:25:27,819 --> 01:25:30,819
So a down actually turns out to be a lateral dodge.

877
01:25:30,819 --> 01:25:35,239
This is freaking ridiculous.

878
01:25:35,239 --> 01:25:36,239
And I'm sorry.

879
01:25:36,239 --> 01:26:10,630
I said a swear word.

880
01:26:10,630 --> 01:26:13,630
I keep, he catches me with it every time.

881
01:26:13,630 --> 01:27:03,640
Oh my God.

882
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:04,640
Thank God.

883
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:05,640
I was in this mode.

884
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:21,220
Wow.

885
01:27:21,220 --> 01:27:22,220
That move sucks.

886
01:27:22,220 --> 01:27:25,630
Jesus.

887
01:27:25,630 --> 01:27:34,250
My controls are backwards.

888
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:54,300
I don't want to fight them that way.

889
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:55,300
God damn it.

890
01:27:55,300 --> 01:27:56,300
What is happening?

891
01:27:56,300 --> 01:28:14,819
Oh my God.

892
01:28:14,819 --> 01:28:23,869
Please.

893
01:28:23,869 --> 01:28:24,869
Oh no.

894
01:28:24,869 --> 01:28:25,869
I just pissed him off.

895
01:28:25,869 --> 01:28:48,550
Oh, that sucked.

896
01:28:48,550 --> 01:29:00,479
That was not good.

897
01:29:00,479 --> 01:29:01,479
That was very bad.

898
01:29:01,479 --> 01:29:02,479
That move.

899
01:29:02,479 --> 01:29:03,479
I don't have any heals.

900
01:29:03,479 --> 01:29:11,500
Turn it on quick.

901
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:12,500
Yes.

902
01:29:17,260 --> 01:30:22,579
That fight was kind of rough.

903
01:30:22,579 --> 01:30:28,760
So dodging like this and going backwards, but back to dodge backwards, it's up.

904
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:32,260
And when he's this way, you got to, it's like this way down.

905
01:30:32,260 --> 01:30:36,260
It's, it's like patting your head and a, and rubber your stomach at the same time.

906
01:30:36,260 --> 01:30:41,979
All right.

907
01:30:41,979 --> 01:30:51,460
We're good.

908
01:30:51,460 --> 01:30:52,460
Side roll suck.

909
01:30:52,460 --> 01:30:53,460
You got to unlock and jump.

910
01:30:53,460 --> 01:30:54,949
Yeah.

911
01:30:54,949 --> 01:30:58,189
I've been conditioned from every from software game.

912
01:30:58,189 --> 01:31:05,960
Unfortunately, just run back and just let go and run back.

913
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:06,960
Yeah.

914
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:10,710
I'm playing against the, there we are.

915
01:31:10,710 --> 01:31:11,710
Okay.

916
01:31:11,710 --> 01:31:22,300
We're back in it now.

917
01:31:22,300 --> 01:31:50,739
From software brain rot.

918
01:31:50,739 --> 01:31:51,739
You're not going to shoot me.

919
01:31:51,739 --> 01:31:58,159
Are you?

920
01:31:58,159 --> 01:32:00,039
If you do, you know, if that's what it takes to shut you up.

921
01:32:00,039 --> 01:32:01,039
It's the crap.

922
01:32:01,039 --> 01:32:06,819
Don't act so rashly, my boy.

923
01:32:06,819 --> 01:32:07,819
I've got a doozy of a story for you, but if you snuff out my voice like that, I won't

924
01:32:07,819 --> 01:32:08,819
be able to tell it now.

925
01:32:08,819 --> 01:32:09,819
Will I?

926
01:32:12,470 --> 01:32:13,470
You saw it too, didn't you?

927
01:32:13,470 --> 01:32:14,470
That huge tower just above us.

928
01:32:14,470 --> 01:32:15,470
You saw it too, didn't you?

929
01:32:15,470 --> 01:32:16,470
That huge tower just above us.

930
01:32:16,470 --> 01:32:17,470
You saw it too, didn't you?

931
01:32:17,470 --> 01:32:18,470
That huge tower just above us.

932
01:32:18,470 --> 01:32:19,470
You saw it too, didn't you?

933
01:32:19,470 --> 01:32:20,470
That huge tower just above us.

934
01:32:20,470 --> 01:32:21,470
You saw it too, didn't you?

935
01:32:21,470 --> 01:32:22,470
That huge tower just above us.

936
01:32:22,470 --> 01:32:23,470
You saw it too, didn't you?

937
01:32:23,470 --> 01:32:24,470
That huge tower just above us.

938
01:32:24,470 --> 01:32:25,470
You saw it too, didn't you?

939
01:32:25,470 --> 01:32:26,470
That huge tower just above us.

940
01:32:26,470 --> 01:32:27,470
You saw it too, didn't you?

941
01:32:27,470 --> 01:32:28,470
That huge tower just above us.

942
01:32:28,470 --> 01:32:29,470
You saw it too, didn't you?

943
01:32:29,470 --> 01:32:30,470
That huge tower just above us.

944
01:32:30,470 --> 01:32:31,470
You saw it too, didn't you?

945
01:32:31,470 --> 01:32:33,350
That huge tower just above us.

946
01:32:33,350 --> 01:32:38,109
You saw it too, didn't you?

947
01:32:38,109 --> 01:32:39,109
That huge tower just above us.

948
01:32:39,109 --> 01:32:40,109
You saw it too, didn't you?

949
01:32:40,109 --> 01:32:42,359
That huge tower just above us.

950
01:32:42,359 --> 01:32:43,359
You saw it too, didn't you?

951
01:32:43,359 --> 01:32:45,369
That huge tower just above us.

952
01:32:45,369 --> 01:32:46,369
You saw it too, didn't you?

953
01:32:46,369 --> 01:32:47,369
That huge tower just above us.

954
01:32:47,369 --> 01:32:48,369
You saw it too, didn't you?

955
01:32:48,369 --> 01:32:49,670
That huge tower just above us.

956
01:32:49,670 --> 01:32:50,670
You saw it too, didn't you?

957
01:32:50,670 --> 01:32:51,670
That huge tower just above us.

958
01:32:51,670 --> 01:32:52,670
You saw it too, didn't you?

959
01:32:52,670 --> 01:32:53,670
That huge tower just above us.

960
01:32:53,670 --> 01:32:54,670
You saw it too, didn't you?

961
01:32:54,670 --> 01:32:55,670
That huge tower just above us.

962
01:32:55,670 --> 01:32:56,670
You saw it too, didn't you?

963
01:32:56,670 --> 01:32:57,670
That huge tower just above us.

964
01:32:57,670 --> 01:32:58,670
You saw it too, didn't you?

965
01:32:58,670 --> 01:32:59,670
That huge tower just above us.

966
01:32:59,670 --> 01:33:00,670
You saw it too, didn't you?

967
01:33:00,670 --> 01:33:01,670
That huge tower just above us.

968
01:33:01,670 --> 01:33:02,670
You saw it too, didn't you?

969
01:33:02,670 --> 01:33:03,670
That huge tower just above us.

970
01:33:03,670 --> 01:33:21,779
It's really making me angry.

971
01:33:21,779 --> 01:33:33,289
Everyone's saying this is me.

972
01:33:33,289 --> 01:33:35,289
I'm like, no.

973
01:33:36,779 --> 01:33:43,350
It sucks to have to know that.

974
01:33:43,350 --> 01:33:44,350
Like that's real.

975
01:33:44,350 --> 01:33:46,350
It actually is.

976
01:33:46,350 --> 01:33:51,319
Like, yeah, I can't fight that.

977
01:33:51,319 --> 01:33:53,319
I can't deny that.

978
01:33:53,319 --> 01:34:08,699
Maybe not that part.

979
01:34:08,699 --> 01:34:20,010
Try that laugh out.

980
01:34:20,010 --> 01:34:22,010
No, no, I just won't play.

981
01:34:22,010 --> 01:34:24,010
I can't.

982
01:34:24,010 --> 01:34:28,680
Because it's going to be cringe inducing.

983
01:34:28,680 --> 01:34:33,350
Let me get this to level two.

984
01:34:33,350 --> 01:34:35,659
I want to level this up to two.

985
01:34:35,659 --> 01:34:36,659
I'm curious about it.

986
01:34:36,659 --> 01:34:44,039
All right.

987
01:34:44,039 --> 01:34:47,920
He who holds this broken device is irradiated

988
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:50,920
and their soul is drained in exchange for power.

989
01:34:50,920 --> 01:34:57,090
Oh, I got to go.

990
01:34:57,090 --> 01:34:58,710
Where do I go?

991
01:34:58,710 --> 01:35:05,430
Where do I need to go?

992
01:35:05,430 --> 01:35:15,439
Oh, no.

993
01:35:15,439 --> 01:36:00,310
Sweet.

994
01:36:00,310 --> 01:36:01,619
Blow up.

995
01:36:01,619 --> 01:36:51,430
Blow up.

996
01:36:51,430 --> 01:37:04,770
Got it.

997
01:37:04,770 --> 01:37:10,420
We're good.

998
01:37:10,420 --> 01:37:12,420
This game would have given me an ulcer when I was a kid.

999
01:37:12,420 --> 01:37:13,600
Hold on.

1000
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:21,939
Come on.

1001
01:37:21,939 --> 01:37:24,590
Get it right.

1002
01:37:24,590 --> 01:37:25,590
Come on.

1003
01:37:25,590 --> 01:37:30,159
I got to get it right.

1004
01:37:30,159 --> 01:37:47,079
What?

1005
01:37:47,079 --> 01:37:52,539
What's happening?

1006
01:37:52,539 --> 01:37:53,539
I'm losing it.

1007
01:37:53,539 --> 01:37:54,539
I just freaked out.

1008
01:37:54,539 --> 01:37:57,060
I'm freaking out.

1009
01:37:57,060 --> 01:37:58,060
I can't fucking get it back.

1010
01:37:58,060 --> 01:37:59,060
I thought it was S.

1011
01:37:59,060 --> 01:38:00,060
What is it?

1012
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:01,060
I'm dead.

1013
01:38:01,060 --> 01:38:02,060
It's higher than S?

1014
01:38:02,060 --> 01:38:03,060
Jesus.

1015
01:38:03,060 --> 01:38:08,060
Press B.

1016
01:38:08,060 --> 01:38:09,060
Oh, I got a new orb.

1017
01:38:09,060 --> 01:39:01,760
Nice.

1018
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:02,760
Right.

1019
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:05,220
I forget what style I'm on half the time.

1020
01:39:05,220 --> 01:39:06,970
Got to help.

1021
01:39:06,970 --> 01:39:10,130
What's going on?

1022
01:39:10,130 --> 01:39:11,130
What was that, dude?

1023
01:39:11,130 --> 01:39:12,130
What the hell was that?

1024
01:39:12,130 --> 01:39:22,520
Oh, my God.

1025
01:39:22,520 --> 01:39:23,520
What?

1026
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:47,479
What was that?

1027
01:39:47,479 --> 01:39:58,130
Oh, my God.

1028
01:39:58,130 --> 01:40:00,460
What was that?

1029
01:40:00,460 --> 01:40:01,460
Oh, my God.

1030
01:40:01,460 --> 01:40:02,460
What was that?

1031
01:40:02,460 --> 01:40:05,229
Oh, my God.

1032
01:40:05,229 --> 01:40:06,229
Oh, my God.

1033
01:40:06,229 --> 01:40:07,229
What?

1034
01:40:07,229 --> 01:40:08,229
What was that?

1035
01:40:08,229 --> 01:40:14,039
Why did the game just do that?

1036
01:40:14,039 --> 01:40:15,039
You got to be kidding me.

1037
01:40:15,039 --> 01:40:19,329
That fucking hurt big time.

1038
01:40:19,329 --> 01:40:23,579
What?

1039
01:40:23,579 --> 01:40:29,909
Why did that just happen?

1040
01:40:29,909 --> 01:40:36,590
Whoa.

1041
01:40:36,590 --> 01:40:38,590
That was actually fucked up.

1042
01:40:38,590 --> 01:40:44,069
Is that a bug in the game that that can happen?

1043
01:40:44,069 --> 01:40:45,439
No way.

1044
01:40:45,439 --> 01:40:49,560
Wow.

1045
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:50,560
That sucked.

1046
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:52,500
I was at.

1047
01:40:52,500 --> 01:40:53,500
Hopefully that wasn't too bad for everybody else.

1048
01:40:53,500 --> 01:40:57,340
I think that was really bad.

1049
01:40:57,340 --> 01:41:02,079
Oh, my God.

1050
01:41:02,079 --> 01:41:06,050
Why the fuck did that happen?

1051
01:41:06,050 --> 01:41:13,500
Jesus.

1052
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:14,500
Whoa.

1053
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:24,819
Is everybody all right?

1054
01:41:24,819 --> 01:41:25,819
Like, I'm serious.

1055
01:41:25,819 --> 01:41:27,819
That was actually really, really bad.

1056
01:41:27,819 --> 01:41:29,819
Everybody like doing all right because that sucked.

1057
01:41:29,819 --> 01:41:34,520
I'm terrified.

1058
01:41:34,520 --> 01:41:36,520
I'm like scared to play the game now.

1059
01:41:36,520 --> 01:41:47,680
Is that weird?

1060
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:49,680
Dude, it's the fucking HD remake.

1061
01:41:49,680 --> 01:41:50,680
Yeah.

1062
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:55,819
What the fuck was that?

1063
01:41:55,819 --> 01:41:56,819
Really?

1064
01:41:56,819 --> 01:42:11,380
What was it?

1065
01:42:11,380 --> 01:42:13,380
I don't know.

1066
01:42:13,380 --> 01:42:16,380
It was something with the game.

1067
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:20,260
I wish I could tell you what just even happened.

1068
01:42:20,260 --> 01:42:33,250
Because look, I mean, take a look.

1069
01:42:33,250 --> 01:42:38,510
The volume should never should not be even possible to go that high.

1070
01:42:38,510 --> 01:42:41,510
Even over here in my in my OBS, I have the mic.

1071
01:42:41,510 --> 01:42:43,750
So this is coming through desktop audio.

1072
01:42:43,750 --> 01:42:47,119
So desktop audio is set to I have it limited.

1073
01:42:47,119 --> 01:42:48,119
There's a limiter on it.

1074
01:42:48,119 --> 01:42:57,619
And in the game, it's only at halfway.

1075
01:42:57,619 --> 01:42:59,619
That was extreme.

1076
01:42:59,619 --> 01:43:02,779
Did you hit your mic?

1077
01:43:02,779 --> 01:43:03,779
No, no, that was in the game.

1078
01:43:03,779 --> 01:43:05,779
That was in this video game.

1079
01:43:05,779 --> 01:43:09,510
Fuck.

1080
01:43:09,510 --> 01:43:11,510
That's not cool.

1081
01:43:11,510 --> 01:43:19,189
It's a glitch on this level.

1082
01:43:19,189 --> 01:43:21,189
I've had that happen before.

1083
01:43:21,189 --> 01:43:23,840
Oh, OK.

1084
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:25,840
Actually patch the game, Capcom.

1085
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:27,840
Actually patch the game.

1086
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:28,840
What?

1087
01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:41,039
Is that actually possible to happen here?

1088
01:43:41,039 --> 01:43:44,300
Dude, I am so fucked up right now.

1089
01:43:44,300 --> 01:43:48,340
Is it still count that I got this?

1090
01:43:48,340 --> 01:43:49,340
I don't want to hit the enemies.

1091
01:43:49,340 --> 01:43:50,340
I'm sorry.

1092
01:43:50,340 --> 01:44:06,079
I'm doing this till we're confirmed.

1093
01:44:06,079 --> 01:44:07,079
This is not going to happen again.

1094
01:44:07,079 --> 01:44:20,840
The shit is at five, not even three percent.

1095
01:44:20,840 --> 01:44:33,979
The game's muted.

1096
01:44:33,979 --> 01:44:34,979
Yeah.

1097
01:44:34,979 --> 01:44:35,979
This is the room that it happened in.

1098
01:44:35,979 --> 01:44:50,579
I'm not having that happen again.

1099
01:44:50,579 --> 01:44:51,579
I.

1100
01:44:51,579 --> 01:44:53,010
Oh, my God.

1101
01:44:53,010 --> 01:44:55,380
I'm like shook from that.

1102
01:44:55,380 --> 01:45:04,850
I'm going to like die again.

1103
01:45:04,850 --> 01:45:10,119
That's just run.

1104
01:45:10,119 --> 01:45:15,460
I don't think I'm going to make it.

1105
01:45:15,460 --> 01:45:17,460
Yeah.

1106
01:45:17,460 --> 01:45:18,460
All right.

1107
01:45:18,460 --> 01:45:19,460
I'm just going to run next time.

1108
01:45:19,460 --> 01:45:28,000
Wait, can I not?

1109
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:32,000
Yeah, I'm going to have to like highlight this VOD and re-uploaded or something, because

1110
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:35,520
I'm not having people deal with that.

1111
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:36,520
That's so fucking awful.

1112
01:45:36,520 --> 01:45:41,739
No, I'm going to have to like do an edit to the VOD.

1113
01:45:41,739 --> 01:45:45,479
Can I just leave?

1114
01:45:45,479 --> 01:45:46,479
OK, I can.

1115
01:45:46,479 --> 01:45:59,180
I think I just run.

1116
01:45:59,180 --> 01:46:00,180
All right.

1117
01:46:00,180 --> 01:46:02,949
So where do I need to?

1118
01:46:02,949 --> 01:46:08,420
Where am I trying to get to?

1119
01:46:08,420 --> 01:46:14,260
Back to the beginning, right?

1120
01:46:14,260 --> 01:46:22,670
Come on, hurry up.

1121
01:46:22,670 --> 01:46:32,489
Fuck.

1122
01:46:32,489 --> 01:46:33,489
I don't know where to go.

1123
01:46:33,489 --> 01:46:34,489
Shit.

1124
01:46:34,489 --> 01:46:36,300
I don't have any healing.

1125
01:46:36,300 --> 01:46:37,300
Oh, that's bad.

1126
01:46:37,300 --> 01:46:41,600
All right.

1127
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:43,600
I need heals, but wait, I'm at full health.

1128
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:44,600
This is actually good.

1129
01:46:44,600 --> 01:46:52,409
That clip was blasted out.

1130
01:46:52,409 --> 01:47:00,850
But yeah, that's I know I take really seriously stuff like that, because I always people always

1131
01:47:00,850 --> 01:47:02,850
ask, hey, dude, your your game volume is kind of quieter.

1132
01:47:02,850 --> 01:47:03,850
This is kind of quiet.

1133
01:47:03,850 --> 01:47:10,579
The amount of shit that gets through the cracks in some of these games or that can blow out

1134
01:47:10,579 --> 01:47:11,579
people's fucking speakers.

1135
01:47:11,579 --> 01:47:14,720
I try to reduce it as best as I can.

1136
01:47:14,720 --> 01:47:22,390
But man, oh, man, something like that happening is just like, holy fucking shit.

1137
01:47:22,390 --> 01:47:42,579
No, where am I going?

1138
01:47:42,579 --> 01:47:44,140
I'm going the wrong way.

1139
01:47:44,140 --> 01:47:50,239
You should watch the clip.

1140
01:47:50,239 --> 01:47:52,060
Hold on.

1141
01:47:52,060 --> 01:47:54,130
We're in a cut scene.

1142
01:47:54,130 --> 01:48:13,010
But listen to the clip right now.

1143
01:48:13,010 --> 01:48:14,010
God, let me see.

1144
01:48:14,010 --> 01:48:17,829
Hey, is that even possible?

1145
01:48:17,829 --> 01:48:25,979
Why?

1146
01:48:25,979 --> 01:48:38,210
No, that's actually not all right.

1147
01:48:38,210 --> 01:48:39,449
I'm being dead serious.

1148
01:48:39,449 --> 01:48:41,449
I just listened to this at like one percent.

1149
01:48:41,449 --> 01:48:42,449
That's not all right.

1150
01:48:42,449 --> 01:48:45,390
Is that actually a bug in the game?

1151
01:48:45,390 --> 01:48:47,949
Because like, you got to be fucking kidding me.

1152
01:48:47,949 --> 01:49:00,699
No, I've played it.

1153
01:49:00,699 --> 01:49:02,699
I've never had this happen.

1154
01:49:02,699 --> 01:49:06,859
Dude, we know you farted.

1155
01:49:06,859 --> 01:49:11,039
This is the PC version.

1156
01:49:11,039 --> 01:49:13,039
Yeah, this is the Steam HD version.

1157
01:49:13,039 --> 01:49:19,380
Oh my goodness.

1158
01:49:19,380 --> 01:49:23,750
I mean, how?

1159
01:49:23,750 --> 01:49:24,750
Why did that?

1160
01:49:24,750 --> 01:49:26,750
I don't even have an explanation for you.

1161
01:49:26,750 --> 01:49:31,260
Is there something on my end?

1162
01:49:31,260 --> 01:49:33,260
I don't think so.

1163
01:49:33,260 --> 01:49:35,520
Not that I could see.

1164
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:39,520
I mean, I've been sitting here playing it the same way since like, you know, two, three

1165
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:40,520
hours ago since last night.

1166
01:49:40,520 --> 01:49:44,579
Restart the game?

1167
01:49:44,579 --> 01:49:51,100
Yeah, I'm going to restart the game.

1168
01:49:51,100 --> 01:49:54,100
The whole HD collection has audio bugs from what my understanding.

1169
01:49:54,100 --> 01:49:57,750
An HD edition only bug.

1170
01:49:57,750 --> 01:50:11,319
Are you in a Discord call?

1171
01:50:11,319 --> 01:50:12,319
No, no, I'm not.

1172
01:50:12,319 --> 01:50:17,210
All right.

1173
01:50:17,210 --> 01:50:21,960
Let me restart the game to get like the audio kind of recombobulated.

1174
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:29,859
And one of the some of the mods have editing access.

1175
01:50:29,859 --> 01:50:34,500
Can some because I can't really do it right now while I'm live.

1176
01:50:34,500 --> 01:50:39,500
Can one of the mods go and do a highlight of the stream like two or three seconds before

1177
01:50:39,500 --> 01:50:41,770
that part?

1178
01:50:41,770 --> 01:50:46,989
And then I'm trying to think how to do this to get rid of that.

1179
01:50:46,989 --> 01:50:49,699
I'll finish the mission.

1180
01:50:49,699 --> 01:50:50,699
Yeah.

1181
01:50:50,699 --> 01:50:51,699
But this is staying on like one percent.

1182
01:50:51,699 --> 01:51:07,789
Yeah.

1183
01:51:07,789 --> 01:51:09,789
Highlight before and after and then we'll delete the VOD.

1184
01:51:09,789 --> 01:51:13,270
Right.

1185
01:51:13,270 --> 01:51:15,279
I'm going in the wrong direction.

1186
01:51:15,279 --> 01:51:16,279
What a sound warning.

1187
01:51:16,279 --> 01:51:17,970
Yeah.

1188
01:51:17,970 --> 01:51:23,359
I mean, a sound warning for a kind of a jump scare or something is one thing, but I just

1189
01:51:23,359 --> 01:51:24,359
listen to that.

1190
01:51:24,359 --> 01:51:25,359
I've and I've been jump scared.

1191
01:51:25,359 --> 01:51:27,359
I've had loud shit happen on this stream.

1192
01:51:27,359 --> 01:51:31,369
That's I don't want anybody fucking hear that.

1193
01:51:31,369 --> 01:51:36,369
That was well and beyond what like a jump scare or like a loud sound or something.

1194
01:51:36,369 --> 01:51:44,260
Okay.

1195
01:51:44,260 --> 01:51:50,050
Is there a safe point here?

1196
01:51:50,050 --> 01:51:51,050
Why wouldn't you play this on Switch?

1197
01:51:51,050 --> 01:51:53,310
I don't know, dude.

1198
01:51:53,310 --> 01:51:54,310
I didn't know that.

1199
01:51:54,310 --> 01:51:59,310
Oh, by the way, there's like ear exploding audio bugs in the HD Steam version.

1200
01:51:59,310 --> 01:52:00,310
I didn't know that.

1201
01:52:00,310 --> 01:52:01,739
I didn't know.

1202
01:52:01,739 --> 01:52:03,739
I just bought the game on Steam.

1203
01:52:03,739 --> 01:52:17,229
I'm just a consumer in this.

1204
01:52:17,229 --> 01:52:19,239
Okay.

1205
01:52:19,239 --> 01:52:20,239
I don't think I can save it.

1206
01:52:20,239 --> 01:52:26,640
I really hope that doesn't happen again.

1207
01:52:26,640 --> 01:52:28,640
It actually is freaking me out.

1208
01:52:28,640 --> 01:52:29,819
I'm not going to lie to you.

1209
01:52:29,819 --> 01:52:44,180
So I try them again.

1210
01:52:44,180 --> 01:52:58,420
Turn on latency mode so you can cut it if it happens again.

1211
01:52:58,420 --> 01:53:02,050
I wonder what the process of that would look like.

1212
01:53:02,050 --> 01:53:16,859
Live editing.

1213
01:53:16,859 --> 01:53:27,560
There's audio bugs and then there's something is potentially left in the game that can like

1214
01:53:27,560 --> 01:53:41,350
break people's fucking computers like speakers, headphones, even me.

1215
01:53:41,350 --> 01:54:02,369
There's no evidence that it was in the game.

1216
01:54:02,369 --> 01:54:03,369
Yeah.

1217
01:54:03,369 --> 01:54:05,609
Well, that's why I'd like to investigate it a little bit more.

1218
01:54:05,609 --> 01:54:16,039
But I have met my OBS settings have been the same from it's got to be like a half a decade

1219
01:54:16,039 --> 01:54:17,039
at this point.

1220
01:54:17,039 --> 01:54:18,039
I didn't really change anything.

1221
01:54:18,039 --> 01:54:51,000
Why would you settings matter if it was a bug?

1222
01:54:53,329 --> 01:54:57,329
I don't want to watch the clip again, but it looked like when I switched, I switched

1223
01:54:57,329 --> 01:54:58,329
between weapons.

1224
01:54:58,329 --> 01:55:00,329
So I went, I attacked with the nunchucks.

1225
01:55:00,329 --> 01:55:02,329
And then I in mid combo, I went, wham.

1226
01:55:02,329 --> 01:55:05,699
And I switched over to this and I did that this move, that one.

1227
01:55:05,699 --> 01:55:11,770
And I think it hit something and hit them in the game's brain like a thousand times

1228
01:55:11,770 --> 01:55:12,770
in a second or something.

1229
01:55:12,770 --> 01:55:23,289
Oh my God.

1230
01:55:23,289 --> 01:55:30,539
I'm going to die.

1231
01:55:30,539 --> 01:55:36,329
I want to die.

1232
01:55:36,329 --> 01:55:39,220
Hi.

1233
01:55:39,220 --> 01:55:40,220
What?

1234
01:55:40,220 --> 01:55:41,220
Oh my God.

1235
01:55:41,220 --> 01:55:55,239
What is going on right now?

1236
01:55:55,239 --> 01:55:56,239
Why did he at one HP?

1237
01:55:56,239 --> 01:56:05,739
Yeah.

1238
01:56:05,739 --> 01:56:09,739
Add to the VOD, add a thing that says like, don't watch this VOD of loud sound.

1239
01:56:09,739 --> 01:56:27,550
Make sure people know that before we, you know, delete it.

1240
01:56:27,550 --> 01:56:30,550
I could also BRB and so I could do a restart of the stream.

1241
01:56:30,550 --> 01:56:42,569
I think that's probably what I'm going to do.

1242
01:56:42,569 --> 01:56:43,569
Oh, you can unpublish the VOD.

1243
01:56:43,569 --> 01:56:44,569
Okay.

1244
01:56:44,569 --> 01:56:56,239
Then do that.

1245
01:56:56,239 --> 01:56:57,239
Don't watch this VOD.

1246
01:56:57,239 --> 01:57:15,500
Seriously.

1247
01:57:15,500 --> 01:57:16,500
You've been louder before?

1248
01:57:16,500 --> 01:57:18,829
No, no way.

1249
01:57:18,829 --> 01:57:22,829
When I listened to that clip at like 0.2% volume, that's the loudest that this stream has ever

1250
01:57:22,829 --> 01:57:44,100
been.

1251
01:57:44,100 --> 01:57:46,859
Once I get this kill, I'm going to restart the game.

1252
01:57:46,859 --> 01:57:57,439
All right.

1253
01:57:57,439 --> 01:58:08,859
Well, this part's annoying.

1254
01:58:08,859 --> 01:58:09,859
Okay.

1255
01:58:09,859 --> 01:58:24,539
Oh my God.

1256
01:58:24,539 --> 01:58:26,739
I'm going to lose again.

1257
01:58:26,739 --> 01:58:27,739
I actually might.

1258
01:58:27,739 --> 01:58:29,420
No, I'm not.

1259
01:58:29,420 --> 01:58:33,539
I don't care.

1260
01:58:33,539 --> 01:59:03,520
I am Andy.

1261
01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:04,520
I would have died right there.

1262
01:59:04,520 --> 01:59:05,520
Yeah.

1263
01:59:05,520 --> 01:59:06,520
Sorry.

1264
01:59:06,520 --> 01:59:08,850
It's been silent, but I need to restart the game and we've got to make sure that the VOD

1265
01:59:08,850 --> 01:59:18,319
is not going to fuck a bunch of people up.

1266
01:59:18,319 --> 01:59:21,859
Haunted.

1267
01:59:21,859 --> 01:59:22,859
Put music on.

1268
01:59:22,859 --> 01:59:26,729
I'll put a little music on in the background.

1269
01:59:26,729 --> 01:59:30,270
That makes sense to me.

1270
01:59:30,270 --> 01:59:43,020
How about reduce the game volume from the actual mixer?

1271
01:59:43,020 --> 01:59:47,020
If the audio engine is bugged out, it will ignore your in-game settings and go super

1272
01:59:47,020 --> 01:59:50,949
loud again.

1273
01:59:50,949 --> 01:59:51,949
Yeah.

1274
01:59:51,949 --> 01:59:52,949
I'll go right to the source here and I'll just put it here.

1275
01:59:52,949 --> 01:59:53,949
I wonder if that helps.

1276
01:59:57,880 --> 02:00:00,439
I'm going to put it at like 20% in the mixer.

1277
02:00:00,439 --> 02:00:05,140
Volume gate.

1278
02:00:05,140 --> 02:00:08,630
I have a volume gate on OBS.

1279
02:00:08,630 --> 02:00:13,869
I have a slider where I can put that the audio should never go over that, but sometimes it

1280
02:00:13,869 --> 02:00:14,869
just doesn't matter apparently.

1281
02:00:14,869 --> 02:00:20,500
Let me get to the end of this and save the game.

1282
02:00:20,500 --> 02:00:34,890
See if that fixed it.

1283
02:00:34,890 --> 02:00:47,159
I need a save point.

1284
02:00:47,159 --> 02:00:51,640
What did that even just do?

1285
02:00:51,640 --> 02:00:52,640
Did I get an item?

1286
02:00:52,640 --> 02:00:54,840
Okay.

1287
02:00:54,840 --> 02:00:58,380
Here we go.

1288
02:00:58,380 --> 02:00:59,380
Save data.

1289
02:00:59,380 --> 02:01:01,390
Save complete.

1290
02:01:01,390 --> 02:01:02,699
All right.

1291
02:01:02,699 --> 02:01:03,699
Let me restart this.

1292
02:01:03,699 --> 02:01:09,260
I'll give the mods the ability to clean up that VOD and do all this shit.

1293
02:01:09,260 --> 02:01:10,500
Let me get some water.

1294
02:01:10,500 --> 02:01:11,500
Take a break.

1295
02:01:11,500 --> 02:01:12,500
I'll be right back.

1296
02:01:12,500 --> 02:01:52,779
Water time.

1297
02:01:52,779 --> 02:08:24,930
Okay.

1298
02:08:24,930 --> 02:08:25,930
Hello.

1299
02:08:25,930 --> 02:08:27,229
I'm back.

1300
02:08:27,229 --> 02:08:33,670
I am going to reopen Devil May Cry.

1301
02:08:33,670 --> 02:08:40,670
I have it set in Windows for it to never be possible to go over a certain decibel in Windows.

1302
02:08:40,670 --> 02:08:42,939
I'll be honest with you.

1303
02:08:42,939 --> 02:08:44,939
I'm fucking paranoid about this now.

1304
02:08:44,939 --> 02:08:48,329
If it happens once, it means it can happen twice.

1305
02:08:48,329 --> 02:08:49,329
You know what I'm saying?

1306
02:08:49,329 --> 02:08:57,100
Let me get it open.

1307
02:08:57,100 --> 02:09:02,899
Should we remove clips of the noise?

1308
02:09:02,899 --> 02:09:04,460
Yeah.

1309
02:09:04,460 --> 02:09:15,579
Guys, if you've got clips, make sure the clips say in the title, like audio warning because

1310
02:09:15,579 --> 02:09:18,579
we've got to be fucking careful with that shit.

1311
02:09:18,579 --> 02:09:37,060
There's no way that came out of the game.

1312
02:09:37,060 --> 02:09:41,060
Yeah, but that's also freaking me out because it's like, where would it be coming from from

1313
02:09:41,060 --> 02:09:42,060
my end too?

1314
02:09:42,060 --> 02:09:46,369
I am flabbergasted as to how that happened.

1315
02:09:46,369 --> 02:09:56,670
Let me make sure this is going to happen the way that I want it to.

1316
02:09:56,670 --> 02:09:57,670
Mixer.

1317
02:09:57,670 --> 02:09:59,170
All right.

1318
02:09:59,170 --> 02:10:02,819
It's at 30 percentile.

1319
02:10:02,819 --> 02:10:29,850
I almost want to...

1320
02:10:29,850 --> 02:10:30,850
Yeah, we'll see.

1321
02:10:30,850 --> 02:10:36,979
I have no idea what happened, but I don't honestly think it probably is not a way to

1322
02:10:36,979 --> 02:10:39,979
ever know what actually just happened.

1323
02:10:39,979 --> 02:10:50,800
Okay, so now I have it set.

1324
02:10:50,800 --> 02:10:58,220
Volume is in the same place.

1325
02:10:58,220 --> 02:11:01,220
I put the volume on the Windows Mixer down.

1326
02:11:01,220 --> 02:11:04,300
Let's see if that helps.

1327
02:11:04,300 --> 02:11:34,359
Let's go back here and see it.

1328
02:11:34,359 --> 02:11:49,210
Where's the last save point?

1329
02:11:49,210 --> 02:11:51,470
Oh, shit.

1330
02:11:51,470 --> 02:12:00,260
Oh, no.

1331
02:12:00,260 --> 02:12:03,020
How far back did I go?

1332
02:12:03,020 --> 02:12:06,430
That's not terrible.

1333
02:12:06,430 --> 02:12:08,930
Oh, is it terrible?

1334
02:12:08,930 --> 02:12:10,229
No, it's not.

1335
02:12:10,229 --> 02:12:25,939
I just have to go fast.

1336
02:12:25,939 --> 02:12:29,239
I know the audio is probably a little low right now, but I'm trying to get it to a point

1337
02:12:29,239 --> 02:12:31,239
where it's not horrible if that happens again.

1338
02:12:31,239 --> 02:12:48,579
Better raise my volume.

1339
02:12:48,579 --> 02:13:23,550
No, don't.

1340
02:13:23,550 --> 02:13:24,550
Jesus.

1341
02:13:24,550 --> 02:13:39,170
What if it happens again?

1342
02:13:39,170 --> 02:13:40,470
I don't know.

1343
02:13:40,470 --> 02:13:46,659
That's why I'm being like super quiet and timid, right?

1344
02:13:46,659 --> 02:13:49,659
The energy has changed since then.

1345
02:13:49,659 --> 02:13:50,659
You know what I'm saying?

1346
02:13:50,659 --> 02:13:51,970
It's changed.

1347
02:13:51,970 --> 02:14:12,819
Are you just shaking?

1348
02:14:12,819 --> 02:14:13,819
I don't know how loud...

1349
02:14:13,819 --> 02:14:22,260
I turned up my speakers on my end here independently before that happened, so I got hit in the fucking

1350
02:14:22,260 --> 02:14:24,260
head with like a brick.

1351
02:14:24,260 --> 02:14:25,260
That's what it feels like.

1352
02:14:25,260 --> 02:14:27,970
Okay, sword piece.

1353
02:14:27,970 --> 02:14:30,399
Hold down right bump with the press B.

1354
02:14:30,399 --> 02:14:38,739
Does it have to be the...

1355
02:14:38,739 --> 02:14:39,739
Ooh, okay.

1356
02:14:39,739 --> 02:14:50,979
So it was when I used the B move for this weapon.

1357
02:14:50,979 --> 02:14:53,539
The fire hit somebody and it was...

1358
02:14:53,539 --> 02:14:55,539
All of a sudden the game just started freaking out.

1359
02:14:55,539 --> 02:14:57,539
Almost like the game was lagging.

1360
02:14:57,539 --> 02:14:58,539
Like hardware lag.

1361
02:14:58,539 --> 02:14:59,539
Like, oh, something's fucked up.

1362
02:14:59,539 --> 02:15:00,539
Something's fucked up.

1363
02:15:00,539 --> 02:15:01,850
And then it just...

1364
02:15:01,850 --> 02:15:14,779
It was as if I hit the guy like a thousand times in a row.

1365
02:15:14,779 --> 02:15:15,779
There's the forbidden move.

1366
02:15:15,779 --> 02:15:18,359
It feels like it.

1367
02:15:18,359 --> 02:15:36,970
I'm going to finagle with it.

1368
02:15:36,970 --> 02:15:37,970
The volume will increase.

1369
02:15:37,970 --> 02:15:41,460
I was going to get it to the right spot where it can't go over a certain threshold.

1370
02:15:41,460 --> 02:15:43,460
It was in this room, by the way.

1371
02:15:43,460 --> 02:15:47,149
I'm afraid of this room, but I'm only going to use the nunchucks.

1372
02:15:47,149 --> 02:16:10,939
It was that enemy right there.

1373
02:16:10,939 --> 02:16:12,939
And I did that B move right here.

1374
02:16:12,939 --> 02:16:15,079
I don't know, man.

1375
02:16:15,079 --> 02:16:16,079
I don't know.

1376
02:16:16,079 --> 02:16:17,079
I wish I knew.

1377
02:16:17,079 --> 02:16:24,270
I'm from the future, dude.

1378
02:16:24,270 --> 02:16:25,270
It's going to happen again.

1379
02:16:25,270 --> 02:16:26,770
Don't say that.

1380
02:16:26,770 --> 02:16:36,780
Okay.

1381
02:16:36,780 --> 02:16:38,020
Okay.

1382
02:16:38,020 --> 02:16:44,290
With that being the case, what if I go like this and then like this?

1383
02:16:44,290 --> 02:16:48,100
Technically speaking, I have it set to...

1384
02:16:48,100 --> 02:16:56,540
In the Windows Mixer, Devil May Cry is set to 30% right now.

1385
02:16:56,540 --> 02:17:04,129
So that means that it cannot go over that by the computer's operating system, right?

1386
02:17:04,129 --> 02:17:13,940
No matter what.

1387
02:17:13,940 --> 02:17:16,590
Surely?

1388
02:17:16,590 --> 02:17:17,590
Well, just be aware.

1389
02:17:17,590 --> 02:17:18,590
That could happen again.

1390
02:17:18,590 --> 02:17:20,590
I don't know how or why, but just be aware.

1391
02:17:20,590 --> 02:17:24,590
I would probably watch the stream at fucking 50% volume at least.

1392
02:17:24,590 --> 02:17:39,780
Shit.

1393
02:17:39,780 --> 02:17:40,780
I need to just run.

1394
02:17:40,780 --> 02:17:41,780
Oh, I fucked up again.

1395
02:17:41,780 --> 02:17:48,379
I'm going to have to heal because I really don't want to do this again.

1396
02:17:48,379 --> 02:17:56,459
Where's my...

1397
02:17:56,459 --> 02:17:57,459
Do I even have heals?

1398
02:17:57,459 --> 02:17:58,459
I do.

1399
02:17:58,459 --> 02:18:00,600
Yeah.

1400
02:18:00,600 --> 02:18:01,600
Okay.

1401
02:18:01,600 --> 02:18:02,600
Wait.

1402
02:18:02,600 --> 02:18:03,600
This is the wrong menu.

1403
02:18:03,600 --> 02:18:04,780
What's the right menu?

1404
02:18:04,780 --> 02:18:07,360
Is it down?

1405
02:18:07,360 --> 02:18:08,360
No.

1406
02:18:08,360 --> 02:18:09,360
How do I get to the fucking menu?

1407
02:18:09,360 --> 02:18:10,360
I'm dead.

1408
02:18:10,360 --> 02:18:23,989
I'm so fucked up right now.

1409
02:18:23,989 --> 02:18:33,250
That actually like flash banged me in real life.

1410
02:18:33,250 --> 02:18:49,319
Let me just start it over.

1411
02:18:49,319 --> 02:18:50,319
Come on.

1412
02:18:50,319 --> 02:19:00,840
Kill me already.

1413
02:19:00,840 --> 02:19:02,840
I wish there was base cam for that.

1414
02:19:02,840 --> 02:19:07,340
It would have been awful looking.

1415
02:19:07,340 --> 02:19:12,340
I had my volume so loud too because I was like, yeah, let me rock out to the fucking music.

1416
02:19:12,340 --> 02:19:13,340
Yeah.

1417
02:19:13,340 --> 02:19:14,340
Devil may cry.

1418
02:19:14,340 --> 02:19:15,340
Let's go.

1419
02:19:15,340 --> 02:19:22,450
I just had to walk in that door.

1420
02:19:22,450 --> 02:19:23,450
It just killed me.

1421
02:19:23,450 --> 02:19:47,059
Just got on the fucking switch.

1422
02:19:47,059 --> 02:19:52,270
How was I supposed to know?

1423
02:19:52,270 --> 02:19:58,270
And why do you even have to play that fucking game of merry-go-round when a game comes

1424
02:19:58,270 --> 02:20:09,379
We got like this four or five versions of the game.

1425
02:20:09,379 --> 02:20:10,379
Oh, don't play that one.

1426
02:20:10,379 --> 02:20:12,559
That one's fucked.

1427
02:20:12,559 --> 02:20:13,559
Huh?

1428
02:20:13,559 --> 02:20:38,329
So the audio sounds okay now, right?

1429
02:20:38,329 --> 02:20:42,850
You guys are getting you hearing all the sounds and everything.

1430
02:20:42,850 --> 02:21:13,860
And honestly, I don't even know if that was from the game.

1431
02:21:13,860 --> 02:21:14,860
Who knows?

1432
02:21:14,860 --> 02:21:17,860
Was it a thing like a bug into OBS or my audio equipment?

1433
02:21:17,860 --> 02:21:20,870
Who fucking knows?

1434
02:21:20,870 --> 02:21:21,870
I'm terrified of it happening again.

1435
02:21:21,870 --> 02:22:06,350
It sounded like your mic fell down.

1436
02:22:06,350 --> 02:22:08,350
No, I was just sitting here.

1437
02:22:08,350 --> 02:22:11,379
I was just sitting right here.

1438
02:22:11,379 --> 02:22:12,379
Just playing the game.

1439
02:22:12,379 --> 02:22:45,879
Oh shit.

1440
02:22:45,879 --> 02:23:11,760
Don't die.

1441
02:23:11,760 --> 02:23:25,670
Shit.

1442
02:23:25,670 --> 02:23:28,510
Get back down here, please.

1443
02:23:28,510 --> 02:23:41,020
Shit.

1444
02:23:41,020 --> 02:23:46,930
I'm dead.

1445
02:23:46,930 --> 02:24:00,520
Okay.

1446
02:24:00,520 --> 02:24:29,469
Let's go.

1447
02:24:29,469 --> 02:24:36,020
Why did I wait that long?

1448
02:24:36,020 --> 02:24:37,020
I just wasted that so bad.

1449
02:24:37,020 --> 02:25:28,700
Well, I did it again, but sorry.

1450
02:25:28,700 --> 02:25:46,829
Watch out for the explosion.

1451
02:25:46,829 --> 02:26:17,540
Oh, I'm going to lose it.

1452
02:26:17,540 --> 02:26:20,540
I lose it every time in the last 10 seconds of this fucking fight.

1453
02:26:20,540 --> 02:26:44,049
Why is the game quiet?

1454
02:26:44,049 --> 02:26:52,510
Yeah, somebody somebody somebody tell them I did beat him already, but I had to restart

1455
02:26:52,510 --> 02:26:55,510
the game because I was afraid of something bugging out and fucking up the audio.

1456
02:26:55,510 --> 02:26:59,290
Okay, so I just beat him.

1457
02:26:59,290 --> 02:27:01,549
So now we go down here.

1458
02:27:01,549 --> 02:27:04,780
This is correct, right?

1459
02:27:04,780 --> 02:27:17,600
Here we are here.

1460
02:27:17,600 --> 02:28:06,819
This is a boss boss right after a boss, huh?

1461
02:28:06,819 --> 02:28:07,819
Jesus.

1462
02:28:07,819 --> 02:28:25,340
I wonder if there's a hmm.

1463
02:28:25,340 --> 02:28:56,750
It's just a attack it or oh shit.

1464
02:28:56,750 --> 02:29:04,329
I'm dead.

1465
02:29:04,329 --> 02:29:11,579
I'll be full health now.

1466
02:29:11,579 --> 02:29:12,579
Okay.

1467
02:29:12,579 --> 02:29:31,229
Let's try it again.

1468
02:29:31,229 --> 02:29:48,409
Hmm.

1469
02:29:48,409 --> 02:29:49,409
All right.

1470
02:29:49,409 --> 02:30:15,670
When it's fully charged, you can't do it.

1471
02:30:15,670 --> 02:30:16,670
Whoa.

1472
02:30:16,670 --> 02:30:22,329
Oh, I can't double jump unless it's out.

1473
02:30:22,329 --> 02:30:23,329
He's too.

1474
02:30:23,329 --> 02:30:37,430
Okay.

1475
02:30:37,430 --> 02:31:15,840
Right.

1476
02:31:15,840 --> 02:31:16,840
Hit the carriage or hit the horse.

1477
02:31:16,840 --> 02:31:19,170
He likes the carriage.

1478
02:31:19,170 --> 02:31:38,709
Oh, right here.

1479
02:31:38,709 --> 02:31:39,709
What just happened?

1480
02:31:39,709 --> 02:31:44,600
That's weird.

1481
02:31:44,600 --> 02:31:45,899
Come here.

1482
02:31:45,899 --> 02:32:09,670
Really?

1483
02:32:09,670 --> 02:32:33,440
Please camera.

1484
02:32:33,440 --> 02:32:35,579
Whoa.

1485
02:32:55,760 --> 02:32:58,600
Whoa.

1486
02:32:58,600 --> 02:33:14,370
All right.

1487
02:33:14,370 --> 02:33:21,559
I should get right here.

1488
02:33:21,559 --> 02:33:22,559
Oh, don't blow it right now.

1489
02:33:22,559 --> 02:33:23,559
I could right now.

1490
02:33:23,559 --> 02:33:42,059
Come here.

1491
02:33:42,059 --> 02:33:43,059
Let's just die.

1492
02:33:43,059 --> 02:33:49,299
Oh, oh.

1493
02:33:49,299 --> 02:33:51,239
Okay, please.

1494
02:33:51,239 --> 02:34:03,739
Almost through.

1495
02:34:03,739 --> 02:34:05,819
It was close.

1496
02:34:05,819 --> 02:34:43,149
Almost.

1497
02:34:43,149 --> 02:34:44,149
Why are you being so serious?

1498
02:34:44,149 --> 02:34:46,159
I'll be honest.

1499
02:34:46,159 --> 02:34:49,059
I'm very annoyed.

1500
02:34:49,059 --> 02:34:56,940
I'm very annoyed in real life.

1501
02:34:56,940 --> 02:34:58,940
I'm exceptionally irritated right now.

1502
02:34:58,940 --> 02:35:03,760
All right.

1503
02:35:03,760 --> 02:35:09,159
Quicksilver.

1504
02:35:09,159 --> 02:35:10,159
Is this a new style?

1505
02:35:10,159 --> 02:35:12,229
No, it is a new style.

1506
02:35:12,229 --> 02:35:26,209
Chill out, dude.

1507
02:35:26,209 --> 02:35:28,579
Just move it to easy mode.

1508
02:35:28,579 --> 02:35:32,159
Yeah, I'm just so fucking mad at the game.

1509
02:35:32,159 --> 02:35:34,159
I'm exceptionally irritated right now.

1510
02:35:34,159 --> 02:35:42,950
It's nothing to do with the video game, but it's all good.

1511
02:35:42,950 --> 02:36:14,079
This guy's back?

1512
02:36:14,079 --> 02:36:43,620
Why was it so easy for Virgil and it's so hard for me?

1513
02:36:43,620 --> 02:36:46,250
That makes me scared of Virgil a little more.

1514
02:36:46,250 --> 02:37:18,420
Is the game worth it?

1515
02:37:18,420 --> 02:37:20,420
I mean, I'm having fun with the game, yeah.

1516
02:37:20,420 --> 02:37:22,559
Oh, spoiler.

1517
02:37:22,559 --> 02:37:28,340
That's the first time I've gotten Damage C ever.

1518
02:37:28,340 --> 02:37:57,170
That's pretty good.

1519
02:37:57,170 --> 02:37:58,170
Put the volume back up.

1520
02:37:58,170 --> 02:38:00,600
I think it's safe to put it back.

1521
02:38:00,600 --> 02:38:09,010
I have it in my Windows Mixer all the way down, so I think I can turn it up over here

1522
02:38:09,010 --> 02:38:26,059
and we should be all right.

1523
02:38:26,059 --> 02:38:28,059
You can mod the game so it has style changing.

1524
02:38:28,059 --> 02:38:29,299
I saw that, actually.

1525
02:38:29,299 --> 02:38:31,299
People were talking about that when I first played it.

1526
02:38:31,299 --> 02:38:37,530
I think it's all right for now.

1527
02:38:37,530 --> 02:38:54,409
So this is 13.

1528
02:38:54,409 --> 02:38:57,709
I refilled my drink and I don't even know where it is.

1529
02:38:57,709 --> 02:38:59,459
All right, beer B.

1530
02:38:59,459 --> 02:39:01,940
I need to go pee again.

1531
02:39:01,940 --> 02:39:04,120
I just made a drink and I don't know what to do with it.

1532
02:39:04,120 --> 02:40:37,200
I brought it back.

1533
02:40:37,200 --> 02:40:39,209
All right, I got my drink back.

1534
02:40:39,209 --> 02:40:40,209
It was in the bathroom.

1535
02:40:40,209 --> 02:40:51,879
It was in the bathroom.

1536
02:40:51,879 --> 02:41:02,569
Why was it in the bathroom, you ask?

1537
02:41:02,569 --> 02:41:06,899
Because I went pee and I brought it into the bathroom.

1538
02:41:06,899 --> 02:41:17,950
I thought you were going to restart stream.

1539
02:41:17,950 --> 02:41:18,950
I restarted the game.

1540
02:41:18,950 --> 02:41:20,260
I don't know.

1541
02:41:20,260 --> 02:41:22,010
I don't know.

1542
02:41:22,010 --> 02:41:24,010
I can't give a reason why that happened.

1543
02:41:24,010 --> 02:41:25,010
I really can't.

1544
02:41:25,010 --> 02:41:27,250
Unless it was the game kind of lagged

1545
02:41:27,250 --> 02:41:29,250
and got fucked up in the engine with the...

1546
02:41:29,250 --> 02:41:30,250
I don't know.

1547
02:41:30,250 --> 02:41:31,809
We have to cheer him up.

1548
02:41:31,809 --> 02:41:32,809
No, I'm good.

1549
02:41:32,809 --> 02:41:33,809
I'm just...

1550
02:41:33,809 --> 02:41:39,059
I hate doing that to people more than anything.

1551
02:41:39,059 --> 02:41:44,180
There's a limit to, you know, a loud fucking sound.

1552
02:41:44,180 --> 02:41:46,860
And there's a limit to it, I think.

1553
02:41:46,860 --> 02:41:48,860
Doing that to that many people,

1554
02:41:48,860 --> 02:41:51,860
it really pisses me off that it happened.

1555
02:41:51,860 --> 02:41:53,170
I hate doing that shit.

1556
02:41:53,170 --> 02:41:57,840
You know, like loud sounds like a jump scare.

1557
02:41:57,840 --> 02:41:58,840
Holy shit.

1558
02:41:58,840 --> 02:42:01,319
But that was not good.

1559
02:42:01,319 --> 02:42:02,319
And I fucking hate that.

1560
02:42:02,319 --> 02:42:05,290
So, all right.

1561
02:42:05,290 --> 02:42:06,850
Get it out of my system.

1562
02:42:06,850 --> 02:42:16,000
I got a lot of money.

1563
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:19,159
It was an hour ago.

1564
02:42:19,159 --> 02:42:22,159
Yeah, but I'm like a won't move on Andy.

1565
02:42:22,159 --> 02:42:23,159
I'm like, fuck.

1566
02:42:23,159 --> 02:42:25,159
I like hate that that happened.

1567
02:42:25,159 --> 02:42:31,139
Seriously, like I'm just like,

1568
02:42:31,139 --> 02:42:44,489
I just wish I could go back and delete it.

1569
02:42:44,489 --> 02:42:45,489
What is this new style?

1570
02:42:45,489 --> 02:42:48,750
I'm controlling style.

1571
02:42:48,750 --> 02:42:50,059
Well, I have to try it.

1572
02:42:50,059 --> 02:42:55,299
I could buy some orbs too.

1573
02:42:55,299 --> 02:43:00,639
I'm doing it.

1574
02:43:00,639 --> 02:43:08,790
What about a gold one?

1575
02:43:08,790 --> 02:43:17,260
No.

1576
02:43:17,260 --> 02:43:18,950
How about blue again?

1577
02:43:18,950 --> 02:43:19,950
Blue again sounds like it's not a bad idea.

1578
02:43:19,950 --> 02:43:20,950
I'll do purple again.

1579
02:43:20,950 --> 02:43:28,139
And I'm going to buy a couple of these.

1580
02:43:28,139 --> 02:43:29,139
I know people are going to be freaking out.

1581
02:43:29,139 --> 02:43:30,139
People say, don't, don't stop, dude.

1582
02:43:30,139 --> 02:43:31,139
What a waste of money.

1583
02:43:31,139 --> 02:43:40,450
It's okay.

1584
02:43:40,450 --> 02:44:02,040
Let's go for it.

1585
02:44:02,040 --> 02:44:03,040
Reset the save file.

1586
02:44:03,040 --> 02:44:05,049
I don't want to do that.

1587
02:44:05,049 --> 02:44:29,969
More?

1588
02:44:29,969 --> 02:44:54,059
Oh, I had a sweet going too.

1589
02:44:54,059 --> 02:44:55,059
You guys ruined everything.

1590
02:44:55,059 --> 02:45:06,899
You should add subway surfers to the corner.

1591
02:45:06,899 --> 02:45:12,569
No, you're not getting subway surfers.

1592
02:45:12,569 --> 02:45:18,420
Am I going the wrong way?

1593
02:45:18,420 --> 02:45:36,549
Was I going the right way?

1594
02:45:36,549 --> 02:45:41,180
I don't know.

1595
02:45:41,180 --> 02:45:43,059
Was I going the right way?

1596
02:45:43,059 --> 02:45:51,409
What about family guy moments?

1597
02:45:51,409 --> 02:45:52,409
No.

1598
02:45:52,409 --> 02:46:18,989
Long staircase.

1599
02:46:18,989 --> 02:46:19,989
Hell's highway.

1600
02:46:19,989 --> 02:46:29,870
How do I get in there?

1601
02:46:29,870 --> 02:46:30,870
There's a blue orb in there.

1602
02:46:30,870 --> 02:46:32,299
How do I open that?

1603
02:46:32,299 --> 02:46:44,979
It feels like mom yelled at us for being too loud and now we're scared.

1604
02:46:44,979 --> 02:46:50,739
The universe just likes to make jokes on my behalf, right?

1605
02:46:50,739 --> 02:46:55,940
An hour before that, two hours before that happened, what did I say?

1606
02:46:55,940 --> 02:46:58,479
What did we talk about very specifically?

1607
02:46:58,479 --> 02:47:00,479
It was incredibly specific.

1608
02:47:00,479 --> 02:47:01,479
What was it?

1609
02:47:01,479 --> 02:47:07,420
It was about audio and how important it is to have proper audio levels.

1610
02:47:08,420 --> 02:47:15,659
And you're telling me that you're telling me that I may have witnessed a like rare one

1611
02:47:15,659 --> 02:47:22,219
in a billion chance bug to create an environment that makes them.

1612
02:47:22,219 --> 02:47:23,219
Huh?

1613
02:47:23,219 --> 02:47:25,850
Today, after talking about audio levels.

1614
02:47:25,850 --> 02:47:26,850
Why?

1615
02:47:26,850 --> 02:47:47,620
That's a protagonist dilemma.

1616
02:47:47,620 --> 02:47:53,190
Protagonist dilemma.

1617
02:47:53,190 --> 02:47:54,190
Oh, no.

1618
02:47:54,190 --> 02:48:10,280
Here comes a tournament arc.

1619
02:48:10,280 --> 02:48:11,280
Oh, dear.

1620
02:48:11,280 --> 02:48:24,680
Okay.

1621
02:48:24,680 --> 02:48:41,219
All right.

1622
02:48:41,219 --> 02:48:42,219
I got that wrong.

1623
02:48:42,219 --> 02:48:54,209
Let's reset it.

1624
02:48:54,209 --> 02:49:05,879
Reset.

1625
02:49:05,879 --> 02:49:08,879
Delete the explosion sound effect in the game folder.

1626
02:49:08,879 --> 02:49:25,040
God, I got it all wrong.

1627
02:49:25,040 --> 02:49:51,090
I mean, so very clearly has to go this way and work backwards.

1628
02:49:51,090 --> 02:49:53,329
It has to go through here.

1629
02:49:53,329 --> 02:49:56,700
So this can't exist up from here.

1630
02:49:56,700 --> 02:49:57,700
How does it go this way?

1631
02:49:57,700 --> 02:50:03,360
Unless it has to go.

1632
02:50:03,360 --> 02:50:25,860
No, I can't go from this one to this one.

1633
02:50:25,860 --> 02:50:26,860
Like that.

1634
02:50:26,860 --> 02:50:27,860
It can't be that one.

1635
02:50:27,860 --> 02:50:34,540
Right.

1636
02:50:34,540 --> 02:50:37,540
How do I get it to hit this one here to go up?

1637
02:50:37,540 --> 02:50:52,100
Wait, hold on a second.

1638
02:50:52,100 --> 02:50:53,100
What is it going?

1639
02:50:53,100 --> 02:50:54,100
What is going on right now?

1640
02:50:54,100 --> 02:51:00,780
Wait, what?

1641
02:51:00,780 --> 02:51:05,149
Okay.

1642
02:51:09,139 --> 02:51:11,860
I got it.

1643
02:51:11,860 --> 02:51:25,590
Again, if it was the case of I didn't even know this room existed.

1644
02:51:25,590 --> 02:51:26,590
Okay.

1645
02:51:26,590 --> 02:51:31,180
Wait, is this first part just bait?

1646
02:51:31,180 --> 02:51:33,180
Or can you actually do this part?

1647
02:51:33,180 --> 02:51:35,579
So this is bait.

1648
02:51:35,579 --> 02:51:41,549
Huh.

1649
02:51:41,549 --> 02:51:42,729
That's funny.

1650
02:51:42,729 --> 02:51:46,930
I would have sat here for a long time if I did not see the shadow over there.

1651
02:51:46,930 --> 02:51:47,930
All right.

1652
02:51:47,930 --> 02:51:56,909
So I got that.

1653
02:51:56,909 --> 02:52:28,739
Do it again.

1654
02:52:28,739 --> 02:52:29,739
Go on.

1655
02:52:29,739 --> 02:52:50,120
Swing.

1656
02:52:50,120 --> 02:53:03,260
Oh, that hurt.

1657
02:53:03,260 --> 02:53:09,690
I haven't any money.

1658
02:53:09,690 --> 02:53:14,829
No, but I just bought stuff, so I'm good.

1659
02:53:14,829 --> 02:53:15,829
So where are we now?

1660
02:53:15,829 --> 02:53:19,420
Okay.

1661
02:53:19,420 --> 02:53:24,379
It's time.

1662
02:53:24,379 --> 02:53:29,649
What's in here?

1663
02:53:29,649 --> 02:53:33,139
Frogs having sex in the pond and they're loud in front of you.

1664
02:53:33,139 --> 02:53:34,139
How is there someone?

1665
02:53:34,139 --> 02:53:35,139
What?

1666
02:53:35,139 --> 02:53:36,139
What was the person talking about?

1667
02:54:22,790 --> 02:54:23,790
Another verse.

1668
02:54:23,790 --> 02:54:24,790
Oh, sorry.

1669
02:54:24,790 --> 02:54:25,790
Okay.

1670
02:54:25,790 --> 02:54:34,049
Read genuine advice.

1671
02:54:34,049 --> 02:54:36,049
No, read frog sex.

1672
02:54:36,049 --> 02:54:37,049
Yes.

1673
02:54:44,219 --> 02:55:01,030
Okay, here we go.

1674
02:55:01,030 --> 02:55:05,059
Dante versus Virgil.

1675
02:55:05,059 --> 02:55:10,159
You could see this exclusive battle.

1676
02:55:10,159 --> 02:55:19,540
Only you pre-order the game now and get the Dante versus Virgil DLC pack included in every copy from pre-orders.

1677
02:55:19,540 --> 02:55:43,879
Okay.

1678
02:55:43,879 --> 02:55:44,879
Well, I didn't make no help.

1679
02:55:44,879 --> 02:55:54,799
It's the first real attempt.

1680
02:55:54,799 --> 02:55:58,790
Ow.

1681
02:55:58,790 --> 02:56:16,719
Come on.

1682
02:56:16,719 --> 02:56:23,079
Shit.

1683
02:56:23,079 --> 02:56:24,379
Weird move set.

1684
02:56:24,379 --> 02:56:41,690
Oh, what's this?

1685
02:56:41,690 --> 02:56:44,700
Is he going devil mode?

1686
02:56:44,700 --> 02:56:46,770
Devil mode?

1687
02:56:46,770 --> 02:56:55,819
Jesus.

1688
02:56:55,819 --> 02:57:04,989
Ow.

1689
02:57:04,989 --> 02:57:06,989
I feel like I'm playing Street Fighter.

1690
02:57:06,989 --> 02:57:07,989
I'm still caught in a combo.

1691
02:57:07,989 --> 02:57:29,940
No, I can't move.

1692
02:57:29,940 --> 02:57:37,389
Okay.

1693
02:57:37,389 --> 02:57:40,399
So if you get hit, he's going to hit you four times in a row.

1694
02:57:40,399 --> 02:57:41,399
Don't get hit.

1695
02:57:41,399 --> 02:58:11,500
Got it.

1696
02:58:11,500 --> 02:58:12,500
All right.

1697
02:58:12,500 --> 02:58:14,500
I'm going to wait to go demon mode until you go demon mode.

1698
02:58:14,500 --> 02:58:15,500
That makes more sense to me.

1699
02:58:15,500 --> 02:58:36,139
That hurts.

1700
02:58:36,139 --> 02:58:44,930
Sorry.

1701
02:58:44,930 --> 02:58:45,930
Well, I did it earlier.

1702
02:58:45,930 --> 02:58:46,930
It's okay.

1703
02:58:46,930 --> 02:59:01,540
All right.

1704
02:59:01,540 --> 02:59:18,020
So you just got to avoid it.

1705
02:59:18,020 --> 02:59:19,959
I got it.

1706
02:59:19,959 --> 02:59:20,959
Come on.

1707
02:59:25,979 --> 02:59:26,979
Oh, my God.

1708
02:59:26,979 --> 02:59:27,979
When you get caught in that, it's over.

1709
02:59:27,979 --> 02:59:46,049
Oh, my God.

1710
02:59:46,049 --> 02:59:49,670
I have like four frames to hit you with anything.

1711
02:59:49,670 --> 02:59:53,899
You just block it.

1712
02:59:53,899 --> 03:00:17,600
We're going back here.

1713
03:00:17,600 --> 03:00:23,129
I wonder if I should put...

1714
03:00:23,129 --> 03:00:26,780
No, I like these swords.

1715
03:00:26,780 --> 03:00:34,329
They're leveled up high, too.

1716
03:00:34,329 --> 03:00:40,049
Regular sword, maybe.

1717
03:00:40,049 --> 03:00:50,069
I haven't used this weapon in a very long time.

1718
03:00:50,069 --> 03:00:56,979
Can I upgrade it?

1719
03:00:56,979 --> 03:01:05,559
I don't even have air hike for it, though.

1720
03:01:05,559 --> 03:01:10,100
Turn up your microphone.

1721
03:01:10,100 --> 03:01:15,520
My microphone has been the same for like five years.

1722
03:01:15,520 --> 03:01:45,620
I'll try it.

1723
03:01:45,620 --> 03:01:49,360
Much better.

1724
03:01:49,360 --> 03:01:50,360
Yeah.

1725
03:01:50,360 --> 03:01:55,250
I'm just going to run from you now.

1726
03:01:55,250 --> 03:01:59,180
Fuck you.

1727
03:01:59,180 --> 03:02:06,049
Come get me.

1728
03:02:06,049 --> 03:02:07,049
Coward.

1729
03:02:07,049 --> 03:02:08,049
I can't hurt him right now.

1730
03:02:08,049 --> 03:02:09,049
Yeah, I'm a coward right now.

1731
03:02:09,049 --> 03:02:35,309
That's fine.

1732
03:02:35,309 --> 03:02:36,309
Whoa.

1733
03:02:36,309 --> 03:02:39,149
Whoa.

1734
03:02:39,149 --> 03:02:52,420
You transformed and I didn't?

1735
03:02:52,420 --> 03:03:05,500
Fine.

1736
03:03:05,500 --> 03:03:06,500
Let's go.

1737
03:03:06,500 --> 03:03:14,780
Oh, shit.

1738
03:03:14,780 --> 03:03:31,579
No, dude.

1739
03:03:31,579 --> 03:03:39,729
Come on, please.

1740
03:03:39,729 --> 03:03:45,319
Epic.

1741
03:03:45,319 --> 03:03:48,610
No, that was bad.

1742
03:03:48,610 --> 03:03:49,610
Get away from me.

1743
03:03:49,610 --> 03:03:50,610
I taunted, too.

1744
03:03:50,610 --> 03:03:51,610
You baited a taunt, you asshole.

1745
03:03:51,610 --> 03:03:55,860
God damn it.

1746
03:03:55,860 --> 03:03:56,860
No, don't.

1747
03:03:56,860 --> 03:04:01,040
Wait.

1748
03:04:01,040 --> 03:04:02,040
Heal.

1749
03:04:02,040 --> 03:04:28,690
What button is it?

1750
03:04:28,690 --> 03:04:29,690
Up.

1751
03:04:29,690 --> 03:04:30,930
What is this horse shit?

1752
03:04:30,930 --> 03:04:31,930
Now with 10% health left.

1753
03:04:31,930 --> 03:05:14,059
Don't.

1754
03:05:14,059 --> 03:05:22,790
Oh, no.

1755
03:05:22,790 --> 03:05:23,790
Shit.

1756
03:05:23,790 --> 03:05:26,629
No.

1757
03:05:26,629 --> 03:05:27,629
God damn it.

1758
03:05:27,629 --> 03:05:28,629
I had it, too.

1759
03:05:28,629 --> 03:05:31,520
You fucking dickhead.

1760
03:05:31,520 --> 03:05:32,520
You dick.

1761
03:05:32,520 --> 03:05:33,520
I got caught in a combo.

1762
03:05:33,520 --> 03:05:34,520
If you get caught in the combo, he's going to do like three bubbles.

1763
03:05:34,520 --> 03:05:35,520
Fuck.

1764
03:05:35,520 --> 03:05:36,520
I can do it, too.

1765
03:05:36,520 --> 03:05:37,520
All right.

1766
03:05:37,520 --> 03:05:38,520
That was better.

1767
03:05:38,520 --> 03:05:39,520
That was cleaner.

1768
03:05:39,520 --> 03:05:41,719
Don't even think about it.

1769
03:05:41,719 --> 03:05:42,719
Did we both do it at the same time again?

1770
03:05:42,719 --> 03:05:43,719
Goodbye.

1771
03:05:43,719 --> 03:05:44,719
Oh, Virgil.

1772
03:05:44,719 --> 03:05:45,719
Look out for Virgil.

1773
03:05:45,719 --> 03:06:15,120
Get out of here.

1774
03:06:15,120 --> 03:06:45,540
Fuck you for doing that with low volume.

1775
03:06:45,540 --> 03:06:59,840
You don't understand.

1776
03:06:59,840 --> 03:07:00,840
Oh.

1777
03:07:00,840 --> 03:08:12,989
Don't even think about it. Did we both do it at the same time again? Goodbye. Yeah. Come here. Oh

1778
03:08:29,120 --> 03:08:51,770
Virgil look out for Virgil get out of here

1779
03:09:09,360 --> 03:09:16,809
Fuck you for doing that with low volume. You don't understand

1780
03:10:16,280 --> 03:10:20,870
Now leave

1781
03:10:20,870 --> 03:10:23,750
That was close

1782
03:10:23,750 --> 03:10:27,110
But you've taken quite a trouncing today haven't you Virgil?

1783
03:10:27,110 --> 03:10:31,750
You could have chopped me into confetti by now if you were in tip-top condition

1784
03:10:31,750 --> 03:10:33,750
Damn you

1785
03:10:33,750 --> 03:10:41,670
You have lost

1786
03:10:41,670 --> 03:10:43,670
Because you underestimated humans

1787
03:10:43,670 --> 03:10:45,670
Wait what?

1788
03:10:45,670 --> 03:10:50,219
What's going on?

1789
03:10:50,219 --> 03:10:52,649
Pure and innocent

1790
03:10:52,649 --> 03:10:58,649
Just like you

1791
03:10:58,649 --> 03:11:06,840
You're spanking my dear

1792
03:11:12,389 --> 03:11:21,270
Somebody said how many people are in this room? Yeah, there's a lot of people in this room right now that weren't here

1793
03:12:08,899 --> 03:12:11,139
The fuck

1794
03:12:16,329 --> 03:12:18,329
Quite a ride, you know

1795
03:12:19,350 --> 03:12:24,090
If any of you had died before getting here our little can would have gone waste

1796
03:12:25,659 --> 03:12:29,420
Therefore my job was to make you battle each other in order to weaken you

1797
03:12:29,979 --> 03:12:35,399
But at the same time guide you here and make sure that you were kept alive

1798
03:12:36,040 --> 03:12:39,020
I even went so far as dressing like a complete idiot

1799
03:12:43,139 --> 03:12:45,139
It's time for bed Mary

1800
03:12:45,780 --> 03:12:48,020
You can visit your dear mother

1801
03:13:00,040 --> 03:13:08,260
It's time for the clown to bow out Darkum dude the show's over impressive

1802
03:13:09,780 --> 03:13:13,000
I expected nothing less from the devil's descendants

1803
03:13:16,440 --> 03:13:29,260
Why does he keep laughing then he's like I had to wear this ridiculous costume

1804
03:13:32,389 --> 03:14:24,340
Like you don't have to laugh anymore damn, okay. Yes. Oh

1805
03:14:30,629 --> 03:15:16,920
It's pretty ugly. All right, that's pretty ugly. Where are we going?

1806
03:15:17,399 --> 03:15:58,709
We're going up to become a god

1807
03:15:58,709 --> 03:16:13,180
So are we heading into the final arc of the game the last like five or six chapters, right the third act nice

1808
03:16:13,500 --> 03:16:57,459
I think we're safe to turn the game back up. Honestly, i'm i'm not using that style move for the devil swords, though

1809
03:16:57,700 --> 03:17:17,700
That's the move that I did getting lured into a false sense of security. Oh, no, it doesn't say that

1810
03:17:34,389 --> 03:17:38,059
All right

1811
03:17:38,059 --> 03:17:47,750
So let's try this because I want to see it. I want to

1812
03:17:49,659 --> 03:17:58,569
I can keep these although maybe I like that better and then what do I got 12 000?

1813
03:17:58,969 --> 03:18:03,129
What about one of these holy waters? No, no, no, no, you know what?

1814
03:18:05,139 --> 03:18:23,399
Fuck it. I'm gonna do it through here. I'm gonna let me just do one quick thing

1815
03:18:29,399 --> 03:18:40,469
one quick thing let's go with that and

1816
03:18:46,569 --> 03:18:59,899
See how that works. Does this sound better? Is it a little louder? I think it can stay right here. Is that better?

1817
03:19:06,840 --> 03:19:18,329
So the idea is I turned a certain uh setting on too over here just in case this dude is paranoid

1818
03:19:18,489 --> 03:19:23,590
Yeah, it's I am super paranoid sacred light

1819
03:19:26,899 --> 03:19:31,059
Sacred light do I have that?

1820
03:19:31,059 --> 03:19:45,899
What's that flash gauntlets and greaves that said boost dante's attack and speed making him well good thing

1821
03:19:45,899 --> 03:19:54,950
I picked these up. I almost just walked completely away from this. This is a weapon

1822
03:19:59,079 --> 03:20:12,440
Really?

1823
03:20:12,440 --> 03:20:20,540
Uh, so that's definitely for that. So where's that thing? Wasn't there one of those thingies here?

1824
03:20:20,700 --> 03:20:55,450
The baowolf this is what Virgil was using. Okay, cool. Okay, so you can hold it. Okay, each one can be held. What about

1825
03:20:56,409 --> 03:21:11,799
Upgrading it beast uppercut great level two. Let's actually take a look. I want to see the um, what can it do?

1826
03:21:17,219 --> 03:21:22,180
You know, why why why what I just did this one is why why pause why why?

1827
03:21:23,940 --> 03:22:06,340
Oh there hyper fist. Okay. Yep. So why why pause why why go I like it? I'm a fan

1828
03:22:14,819 --> 03:22:36,420
Why pause nice? Yeah, there's a dive kick. It's crazy

1829
03:22:36,819 --> 03:22:51,420
Charging does stupid damage. Oh, i'm gonna have fun with it. There's one door through here. Pretty cool

1830
03:22:51,659 --> 03:23:11,110
Is there anything else? It's a nice weapon for sure. We're about to test it probably right now. Yep. Okay

1831
03:23:11,510 --> 03:23:28,149
I got that and let's go this way. Can you do your own demon boss voice? Yeah, I will I will do

1832
03:23:28,790 --> 03:23:30,629
the next uh boss

1833
03:23:30,629 --> 03:24:01,430
I'll do all of their dialogue and you better believe it's going to be low pitched with a filter on it

1834
03:24:01,430 --> 03:24:50,870
That's like this sounds kind of sounds like this get off the wall. Stop turtling. Okay. Where's that door? Where's that door?

1835
03:24:51,190 --> 03:25:33,780
Didn't I just come from here? Yeah. No, I did I Jesus even that was loud. Are you gonna do the food thing?

1836
03:25:34,579 --> 03:25:39,270
Yeah, we'll take a break. Uh, we'll do the food. I I got the compilation of the data

1837
03:25:56,459 --> 03:26:08,780
Okay. Whoa

1838
03:26:08,780 --> 03:26:13,420
You so you stop time. Ah now I see why people were saying this is the best move in the game

1839
03:26:39,020 --> 03:27:07,059
Shit, I don't like when they block. It's really expensive on btd. Is it?

1840
03:27:07,700 --> 03:27:28,760
Can I do anything else here? I wonder

1841
03:27:31,299 --> 03:27:42,250
No, I just did it. Ooh

1842
03:27:42,649 --> 03:27:51,700
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, there was some oh crap. I feel like I missed there was another way to go

1843
03:27:51,780 --> 03:28:05,270
Go over there. I think there was right god. Damn it. It's doing this. Okay, it's

1844
03:28:29,760 --> 03:28:50,420
Restock restock. Okay. So I wonder if you get it wrong. Do you have to do it again?

1845
03:28:50,579 --> 03:29:15,500
How much is a fully charged punch? Do I wonder the dive kick is really good, too

1846
03:29:15,899 --> 03:29:38,819
All right, it's it slows down your play style a little bit. I don't I can't say I love it

1847
03:29:39,299 --> 03:29:43,209
i'm a lot used to uh spinning around with the

1848
03:29:44,389 --> 03:30:13,540
Nunchucks, all right. So which way do I actually want to go here this way? All right swing swing

1849
03:30:13,940 --> 03:30:26,579
Okay. Well, never mind. The dive kick is the best part

1850
03:30:47,739 --> 03:30:50,489
Everything's open now. Um

1851
03:30:50,729 --> 03:31:23,579
Anything special I have to do. What do I do? This is the only one that's not open

1852
03:31:23,819 --> 03:31:50,120
This is not open just leave go out the door like just like just leave leave. Oh, there is a door

1853
03:31:50,440 --> 03:32:00,500
Is this I don't know what i'm going. This is wrong. Isn't it? I I don't know what's going on. Oh, I found it

1854
03:32:31,909 --> 03:32:37,590
Back up watch out food mode. I don't know if this would be a good food mode candidate

1855
03:32:46,360 --> 03:32:49,260
No, I don't think so

1856
03:32:49,260 --> 03:32:51,659
This this would be pretty low on the scale for food mode

1857
03:32:51,979 --> 03:33:15,690
I feel like the food mode computer would be would do way worse than me. Okay. So where are we now interesting?

1858
03:33:24,260 --> 03:33:34,950
I'm saving money. I've used way too much on purple orbs. But what is anything here? I can do

1859
03:33:35,270 --> 03:34:29,850
I feel like this moves. I have no idea. Oh, okay. What's the end goal?

1860
03:34:29,930 --> 03:34:36,379
Where am I trying to go? He went up in the sky and then it was like, okay now

1861
03:34:37,899 --> 03:34:58,579
Oh, I think over there. This looks like I can go up the love planet. What the hell is this?

1862
03:35:02,309 --> 03:35:23,559
Wait, no, this is back. I think I made it any secrets. No, can't use those. All right. Goodbye

1863
03:35:23,879 --> 03:36:08,459
Okay, am I going back to the very beginning of the game? Yeah, this is like the first area dante's office gold orb

1864
03:36:16,969 --> 03:37:10,409
Wait, no this way. There's kill them. All right, die. How come he hasn't left the starting area since yesterday? I've just been

1865
03:37:11,129 --> 03:37:18,120
I don't understand guys. I keep killing the same enemies. I don't get it. Where am I supposed to go from here? I don't understand it

1866
03:37:23,479 --> 03:37:38,860
It's two

1867
03:37:38,860 --> 03:37:43,659
Dude, oh

1868
03:37:43,659 --> 03:38:06,809
Get behind. Oh, no. I'm not doing this whole thing again. No way

1869
03:38:07,290 --> 03:38:46,600
Why do you have 5 000 times more hp than usual? You die already

1870
03:39:00,940 --> 03:39:16,329
Cool. So is it nothing here? I guess I don't understand. I didn't accomplish anything

1871
03:39:40,889 --> 03:39:55,180
What is my goal right now to get to the top of the tower?

1872
03:40:14,200 --> 03:40:52,329
Hmm, there's another door in here. Where's this other door? Where is this other door under the stairs?

1873
03:40:57,340 --> 03:41:00,860
Oh, this is I didn't even this blended in with the environment. I couldn't see this

1874
03:41:01,180 --> 03:42:04,020
Do you get to ride the motorcycle? That'd be awesome

1875
03:42:04,260 --> 03:42:45,670
You should get to keep that and use that as a melee weapon. What were they thinking?

1876
03:42:50,219 --> 03:42:54,489
t s d c

1877
03:42:55,540 --> 03:43:47,559
No, I want to seize across the board. Oh, well the gate crusher control the tower control your destiny

1878
03:43:52,219 --> 03:43:54,219
You still are you still mad about the audio thing?

1879
03:43:55,899 --> 03:44:14,920
I was just I still fuming like an hour and 45 minutes later. No, i'm, all right. I'm, all right

1880
03:44:15,159 --> 03:44:37,219
How about a beard cam?

1881
03:44:48,229 --> 03:44:49,540
No

1882
03:44:49,540 --> 03:45:16,659
Sorry, I was reading something. Sorry. I'm reading something. I'm not i'm promise i'm reading i'm not reading a guide

1883
03:45:16,659 --> 03:45:37,239
I promise i'm not reading a guide. All right, i'm not reading a guide. I i just looked up tips and tricks for

1884
03:45:37,719 --> 03:45:57,700
Uh chapter 15. That's all I did. Hello. Oh, it's a mini boss

1885
03:46:04,280 --> 03:46:31,770
Hmm, oh shit two mini bosses you guys are kind of annoying

1886
03:46:41,659 --> 03:47:27,829
Get over here. Oh these things suck. I hate having to jump to enemies and do one move. Oh spiders

1887
03:47:55,770 --> 03:48:23,100
Don't die. Come here. Oh my why do they have to run away? Does every enemy run away in this game?

1888
03:48:23,340 --> 03:48:29,340
They all just like go far away from you. That's a sin. Stop

1889
03:48:40,579 --> 03:48:43,129
You don't whoa

1890
03:48:43,129 --> 03:48:45,129
You don't level up quicksilver. Okay

1891
03:48:47,110 --> 03:48:49,129
I should take it off

1892
03:48:49,129 --> 03:48:51,930
What is happening to my character right now?

1893
03:49:06,299 --> 03:49:24,120
Okay, is this it there are three indentations. Okay, this is definitely it say the line

1894
03:49:24,280 --> 03:49:48,809
What's which what line you want me to say? The secret's up there. Oh, you want me to say the enemy spider line

1895
03:49:52,280 --> 03:50:15,190
I can do that. Welcome go that way. I just came from that way an energy source has been activated

1896
03:50:15,590 --> 03:51:02,860
Large snapping sound like two parts locking together can be heard from beyond the wall. I don't think I'd do anything with that. Okay

1897
03:51:04,299 --> 03:51:13,190
Um

1898
03:51:13,190 --> 03:51:33,079
I don't get it

1899
03:51:33,079 --> 03:51:37,579
Was there something else in this room that I wasn't part of the fucking right camera angle?

1900
03:51:37,659 --> 03:52:02,459
So I had to I have to look at it from a different angle or something. What is this? Is this just a object?

1901
03:52:13,399 --> 03:52:21,829
No, there's nowhere to go. Yeah, I see these two doors, but I don't have the device to turn this on

1902
03:52:27,829 --> 03:52:55,500
Re-indentations, what is this? A massive force is shaking the tower. Have you ever eaten cat food before? No, dude

1903
03:52:55,819 --> 03:53:05,270
I can't say I have what are you distracted me? What what just what just even happened a loud sound was heard

1904
03:53:06,889 --> 03:53:33,190
No, I haven't eaten cat food before did this move or change or no? I don't think so. Oh, okay

1905
03:53:39,659 --> 03:53:54,389
Now this is moving. Oh shit. I want those give it. I want those things over there. I'm gonna get them

1906
03:53:54,469 --> 03:54:15,620
This will be interesting. Okay, the whole tower is

1907
03:54:16,239 --> 03:54:21,479
Rotating. All right back up. Where's that door?

1908
03:54:26,520 --> 03:54:30,540
Oh, no

1909
03:54:30,540 --> 03:54:44,120
No, not right now. That would be a mistake to do it here. Did it count? It counted. Oh jeez

1910
03:54:46,299 --> 03:54:50,579
Uh, i'm making it

1911
03:55:19,719 --> 03:55:38,469
That's fine. He's ignoring us. What do you mean? All right. Now I go back

1912
03:55:39,030 --> 03:55:59,239
Does that open this?

1913
03:55:59,239 --> 03:56:02,840
You're not nice. How do you get over this shit reliably?

1914
03:56:25,620 --> 03:56:37,579
12 000 I could do i'm gonna save it because I want to get do I want to upgrade the beowulf or not?

1915
03:56:37,819 --> 03:56:59,940
I think I actually might just I like the regular sword a lot. Beowulf does a ton of damage though

1916
03:57:01,540 --> 03:57:40,899
I'll i'll do it. I'll do it. I'm gonna get the um, i'm gonna get beast uppercut. So here we are

1917
03:57:42,579 --> 03:57:43,940
Activate this last one

1918
03:57:43,940 --> 03:57:59,659
It does it does so much damage though. You guys are right. All right now back in here say the line small

1919
03:58:00,219 --> 03:58:04,309
Or large giant enemy spider. There you go

1920
03:58:06,629 --> 03:58:22,250
This path leads back to the human world to enter the demon world one must proceed towards the heavens from the central route

1921
03:58:32,700 --> 03:59:12,459
Oh back down here. I think this is right. Yeah, one of these yeah, this is definitely it. All right

1922
03:59:12,620 --> 03:59:30,659
Let's test our new move. Never mind. I'm watching the broken audio clip. It's making me literally ache from laughing

1923
03:59:32,059 --> 03:59:40,229
Well, i'm really glad that you think that i'm glad that you think that i'm still very upset that it happened though

1924
03:59:41,500 --> 03:59:42,860
It aches

1925
03:59:42,860 --> 03:59:44,860
At least as long as somebody

1926
03:59:46,819 --> 03:59:48,180
Okay, I

1927
03:59:48,180 --> 03:59:57,819
Am I supposed to do that?

1928
03:59:57,819 --> 03:59:59,819
My chest hurts from laughing at it

1929
04:00:01,979 --> 04:00:03,979
It sucked it was so bad

1930
04:00:09,620 --> 04:00:11,620
That was exploded I

1931
04:00:12,579 --> 04:00:18,979
I can't man

1932
04:00:19,299 --> 04:00:22,059
That sucks

1933
04:00:28,659 --> 04:00:34,899
Oh nice

1934
04:00:34,899 --> 04:00:36,899
The important thing is we all had fun

1935
04:00:37,540 --> 04:00:40,040
And that is very important to me

1936
04:00:40,120 --> 04:00:59,049
Is this right?

1937
04:00:59,049 --> 04:01:02,219
No, is it right?

1938
04:01:02,219 --> 04:01:04,899
I have to go up the tower

1939
04:01:04,899 --> 04:01:06,899
Maybe it is right. No, it's not

1940
04:01:09,379 --> 04:01:11,690
Is it

1941
04:01:11,690 --> 04:01:16,729
Isn't so how do I scale the tower?

1942
04:01:17,620 --> 04:01:30,870
Find out this guy is this guy is actually this bad

1943
04:01:34,090 --> 04:01:37,530
Dude, I know you've probably played this game like 30 times already

1944
04:01:38,489 --> 04:01:55,579
I don't know where the hell i'm going

1945
04:01:55,579 --> 04:01:57,670
So I have to go down

1946
04:01:57,670 --> 04:01:59,670
There has to be a way to go inside

1947
04:01:59,670 --> 04:02:21,540
Or maybe not. Okay

1948
04:02:22,219 --> 04:02:24,219
Um, did I go in here?

1949
04:02:24,459 --> 04:02:28,780
How many okay?

1950
04:02:28,780 --> 04:02:30,780
Where the fuck do I even go?

1951
04:02:31,610 --> 04:02:33,610
Can I get in here somehow?

1952
04:02:33,930 --> 04:02:52,059
This is one of the most confusing missions in the entire series to be honest, if not the most

1953
04:02:53,540 --> 04:02:54,659
um

1954
04:02:54,659 --> 04:02:55,860
Oh, okay

1955
04:02:55,860 --> 04:03:08,420
I mean i'm assuming I have to go up the tower because that's where he went

1956
04:03:12,299 --> 04:03:18,680
He went up

1957
04:03:18,680 --> 04:03:23,639
I went that way. I'm gonna go the other way. It's not something to do with this, right?

1958
04:03:24,280 --> 04:03:47,690
Okay, I have no idea

1959
04:03:47,690 --> 04:03:51,989
I feel like i'm close to being in the right spot, but not really

1960
04:03:52,549 --> 04:03:59,500
This is the only logical way, right?

1961
04:04:04,309 --> 04:04:09,690
This I wish I could delete these enemies from the game and just go in the code and do it myself

1962
04:04:16,139 --> 04:04:17,420
It's obvious

1963
04:04:17,420 --> 04:04:19,180
I feel like it's not

1964
04:04:19,180 --> 04:04:33,450
That's not a door. I guess i'm just gonna go

1965
04:04:34,329 --> 04:04:36,329
but this takes me back to the

1966
04:04:36,659 --> 04:04:43,270
first area

1967
04:04:43,270 --> 04:04:44,870
I'm going back to the

1968
04:04:44,870 --> 04:05:02,250
The first part of the game. What the fuck am I supposed to do here? Maybe i'm supposed to go back that way

1969
04:05:02,649 --> 04:05:10,200
Go back to the spider room

1970
04:05:14,260 --> 04:05:16,760
really

1971
04:05:16,760 --> 04:05:17,799
um

1972
04:05:17,799 --> 04:05:22,440
Okay to change gears maybe I guess

1973
04:05:36,709 --> 04:06:10,819
All right, i'm going back to the spider room. Okay back here. This is actually pretty far back

1974
04:06:11,059 --> 04:06:22,500
Okay, so I have the was it like a crab in the bottom bird mushroom at the top right?

1975
04:06:22,819 --> 04:06:30,760
Okay, red purple and blue and what what side do they have to be on spin it again?

1976
04:06:31,000 --> 04:06:44,940
Okay, so this is blue in the top left. Is that correct?

1977
04:06:52,469 --> 04:07:03,340
There's a couple of sections in the top left that didn't go to you

1978
04:07:03,340 --> 04:07:06,059
They kind of got to eat corn a corn one corn of kernel at a time

1979
04:07:06,299 --> 04:07:18,620
I spoon the whole thing in my mouth bro. Okay, this is apparently correct

1980
04:07:19,100 --> 04:08:05,260
Or different somehow. I think it's different enough. Like we're doing this again. I'm gonna die. Oh shit

1981
04:08:05,340 --> 04:08:22,020
We're even all right. Where how far back is this? This is really far back. Oh, no, it's not right. Where am I?

1982
04:08:24,040 --> 04:08:37,799
No, no, no, this is this is this is lit up. It didn't make any progress progress at all. So it's fine

1983
04:08:41,180 --> 04:08:44,940
I almost like want to just have chat tell me exactly what door to go in

1984
04:08:45,020 --> 04:08:49,420
We've we've done that before. I don't know if I want to walk in circles for the next hour

1985
04:08:52,409 --> 04:08:59,450
All right, so does position matters here blue is in the top left purple in the bottom

1986
04:08:59,450 --> 04:09:01,850
This is where it was before I hit this and I spun it again

1987
04:09:14,889 --> 04:09:21,299
Now purple is in top left. Do I not hit it again?

1988
04:09:21,700 --> 04:09:43,719
I could just I wonder maybe red in the top left. It is not about rotation. You need to explore man

1989
04:09:43,799 --> 04:09:49,719
Okay. Well, where does this take me? I remember this part

1990
04:09:51,579 --> 04:10:09,850
Uh, well, I guess i'm just gonna try to go through here because I did this last time. So where does this go?

1991
04:10:10,489 --> 04:10:33,059
Did not see this yet. I didn't make it past geez. Don't do any more sound effects shit

1992
04:10:33,639 --> 04:10:45,930
That that was queuing up a sound effect. All right, so this part I have two of these now

1993
04:11:01,540 --> 04:11:12,260
All right, so there's top left area and then top right so I think I have to just go that way

1994
04:11:12,579 --> 04:11:23,959
So i'm gonna try to get to the top right area. You missed one of the rotations

1995
04:11:24,520 --> 04:11:32,260
It's gonna put blue in the top left

1996
04:11:32,340 --> 04:11:45,700
Okay, so now this is blue

1997
04:11:54,780 --> 04:11:56,780
Oh my god, leave me alone

1998
04:11:58,409 --> 04:12:00,409
Uh, can I even get back up?

1999
04:12:00,649 --> 04:12:03,420
How do I get back up there?

2000
04:12:03,420 --> 04:12:06,809
Like you guys are so fucking annoying

2001
04:12:15,030 --> 04:12:19,750
Right there i'm like

2002
04:12:36,780 --> 04:12:41,899
Get off what the fuck game why can I not what the hell

2003
04:12:49,030 --> 04:12:51,430
Did I still count that I got the fucking item?

2004
04:12:52,309 --> 04:12:53,430
I hope so

2005
04:12:53,430 --> 04:13:22,459
Okay, here we go fragment. Here's the all right, so I need a couple more. Okay. So technically I did not do this yet

2006
04:13:22,459 --> 04:13:30,389
So I have to go this way

2007
04:13:30,389 --> 04:13:46,520
Jesus

2008
04:13:46,680 --> 04:13:48,739
Come on

2009
04:13:48,739 --> 04:13:50,819
Why can I not jump over this?

2010
04:13:51,299 --> 04:13:53,299
It's fucking horseshit

2011
04:14:09,299 --> 04:14:12,899
All right. I need to go in here because I have not technically gone in here

2012
04:14:17,000 --> 04:14:18,139
Okay

2013
04:14:18,139 --> 04:14:35,239
This is the spider room. All right. Do I have the whole thing? I got the whole thing. Don't I I need one more

2014
04:14:35,799 --> 04:14:40,840
All right. That last one is definitely down to the lower left. I got it

2015
04:14:43,319 --> 04:14:49,510
Try spin this again. I think I have to spin this again to get red in the top left

2016
04:15:07,299 --> 04:15:09,299
Wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong

2017
04:15:10,340 --> 04:15:11,379
wrong

2018
04:15:11,379 --> 04:15:15,000
Is it wrong? I needed to be wait. They're wrong

2019
04:15:23,129 --> 04:15:26,489
Purple needs to be in the top left. I'm all right with people backstading this part

2020
04:15:27,129 --> 04:15:52,059
Okay, and go I can always I can do it this way, but not the other way for some reason

2021
04:16:11,690 --> 04:16:13,129
Okay

2022
04:16:13,129 --> 04:16:22,389
Um, this is it. I gotta go this way. I'm not gonna spin that

2023
04:16:23,719 --> 04:16:27,799
There should be an item in here and if there isn't i'm gonna scream

2024
04:16:28,600 --> 04:16:36,329
There definitely is

2025
04:16:36,329 --> 04:16:39,909
uh

2026
04:16:40,469 --> 04:16:42,469
How do you jump over this

2027
04:16:42,469 --> 04:16:54,489
I got it. Yes

2028
04:17:04,969 --> 04:17:10,250
I'm stuck get me the fuck out of that. I don't want to do this again

2029
04:17:19,059 --> 04:17:28,149
Okay, everything's good. We're fine

2030
04:17:28,149 --> 04:17:37,239
Okay, here we go. I have i'm buying i'm buying one of these because I don't care. I don't want to do this again

2031
04:17:38,309 --> 04:17:53,909
What's with your title? What does it say s ranked orb collector pondering wizards in your area with that three?

2032
04:17:53,989 --> 04:18:07,739
I'm to lean that three face

2033
04:18:07,739 --> 04:18:13,989
Okay. Now the fun part is I got to get back to the middle and good luck having me remember how to get the fuck back

2034
04:18:13,989 --> 04:18:17,420
To the middle

2035
04:18:17,420 --> 04:18:24,170
It's this way, right?

2036
04:18:24,170 --> 04:18:32,329
I can't die here. This is so hard. This is the hardest part of the game

2037
04:18:39,479 --> 04:18:41,959
These jumps these jumps make no sense

2038
04:18:56,170 --> 04:19:01,559
All right, i'm out

2039
04:19:01,559 --> 04:19:03,559
Now I gotta go. I don't know

2040
04:19:05,500 --> 04:19:07,579
I don't know. I don't know where to go

2041
04:19:08,379 --> 04:19:10,379
How do I get back to that room?

2042
04:19:10,700 --> 04:19:16,069
I just want to fucking fight the boss. I just want to fight the boss and do fun cool combos

2043
04:19:49,719 --> 04:19:51,719
Hey, what are you eating? Thank god for food mode

2044
04:19:51,879 --> 04:19:57,530
It's

2045
04:19:57,530 --> 04:20:04,870
I uh, well, i've got a chicken salad sandwich right here. I think of french fries. It's it's been pretty sick

2046
04:20:08,489 --> 04:20:12,090
What the hell? How do I get out of here? I don't even

2047
04:20:12,649 --> 04:20:18,729
Whoa, just get me out of this

2048
04:20:19,129 --> 04:20:26,459
I don't even know what door to go through to get the fuck back to the this thing in the middle

2049
04:20:26,940 --> 04:20:45,610
I need to spin it again

2050
04:20:56,889 --> 04:21:00,809
Okay, can I play now can I play the mission can I please play

2051
04:21:02,229 --> 04:21:04,229
I don't I don't want to do this

2052
04:21:07,180 --> 04:21:10,940
I have to eat that. I know it's stupid. It sucks, but I have to do this

2053
04:21:12,520 --> 04:21:15,079
I have to eat this. I'm sorry everybody. I have to

2054
04:21:26,170 --> 04:21:28,250
I'm not starting this whole section over again

2055
04:21:40,860 --> 04:21:42,120
Okay

2056
04:21:42,120 --> 04:21:44,860
I am now

2057
04:21:44,860 --> 04:21:46,540
in this room

2058
04:21:46,540 --> 04:21:49,639
again

2059
04:21:49,639 --> 04:21:51,370

2060
04:21:51,370 --> 04:21:53,450

2061
04:22:04,420 --> 04:22:06,420
Dude devil may cry free

2062

Did you do a ls dodge dodge dash dash boom boom boom boom

2064
04:22:15,700 --> 04:22:20,500
Rotate the fucking tower dude, just walk around this circle for fucking 30 minutes

2065
04:22:26,340 --> 04:22:28,180
Get out of my way

2066
04:22:28,180 --> 04:22:31,139
Get out of the get out of the way. They're ruining everything

2067
04:22:43,530 --> 04:22:46,010
No, no, no move. What happened? Oh

04:22:47,500 --> 04:22:52,040
Get

2069
04:22:52,040 --> 04:22:53,559
Get away from me

2070
04:22:53,559 --> 04:22:57,819
If I fell off again, I was about to eat my controller

2071
04:23:06,899 --> 04:23:14,579
All right, get me out of here. Okay, we did we did it. We did it. We did it. I'm here

2072
04:23:15,059 --> 04:23:30,280
What do you mean? We I know it's oh fuck. I didn't make it. How do I get out of here? Um, and then down

2073
04:23:33,700 --> 04:23:37,000
And then back around

2074
04:23:37,000 --> 04:23:39,399
Rotate the wheel bro. I don't wanna

2075
04:23:46,700 --> 04:23:48,940
Defiant defiant child

2076
04:23:49,819 --> 04:23:52,379
I don't what did I do it? No, I have to press

2077
04:23:58,899 --> 04:24:07,829
I don't wanna

2078
04:24:07,829 --> 04:24:12,940
Take the teleporter. All right, somebody actually helped me out here. So now I have the three pieces

2079
04:24:13,420 --> 04:24:22,059
I need to go teleport back to the casino walk out the door and then put this in that's correct, right?

2080
04:24:22,299 --> 04:24:37,290
The teleported to the casino is somewhere in this vicinity. Get back up the stairs young man

2081
04:24:43,379 --> 04:24:51,290
Shut up. You're not getting any help. Come on. I need to go down

2082
04:24:51,770 --> 04:24:53,770
I don't know. I don't know how to get connected over here

2083
04:24:56,250 --> 04:25:04,090
I wish I could fly go down then exit the tower enter the strip club and then enter the teleport

2084
04:25:17,639 --> 04:25:32,420
Ban that guy. No allow that person to stay so down here and then I

2085
04:25:32,979 --> 04:25:52,620
I don't even remember what room the strip club was

2086
04:25:52,620 --> 04:26:00,100
This is right. I have to rotate this two more times this dude actually bought it. Where are you going?

2087
04:26:00,579 --> 04:26:11,770

2088
04:26:14,059 --> 04:26:48,790
Um to go rotate it I have to rotate it two more times. I will believe you I would trust you rotate it three times

2089
04:26:51,450 --> 04:26:56,889
Stop, that's the way to get out of here rotate it three times

2090
04:27:00,059 --> 04:27:07,930
Somebody just laughed out loud when they heard me say that I did because I I would do it too

2091
04:27:09,700 --> 04:27:16,469
All right, rotate this shit's free tough two times. I don't want to go down here and hit this two more times

2092
04:27:18,629 --> 04:27:49,860
Do it once it's twice. It's twice. It's twice. I'm gonna try it once

2093
04:27:59,399 --> 04:28:01,399
This section is fucking dog shit

2094
04:28:02,040 --> 04:28:14,389

04:28:21,610 --> 04:28:24,809
Please it shouldn't be that hard to get on here

2097
04:28:37,930 --> 04:28:40,010
Buy air hike. I bought air hike for a weapon

2098
04:28:40,729 --> 04:28:46,409
That when I do the special move has a chance a one percent chance to blow my speakers out

2099
04:28:47,879 --> 04:29:23,670
I don't want to use that weapon go did it happen again. No, I just don't want it to

2100
04:30:01,739 --> 04:30:06,020
Gate

2101
04:30:40,170 --> 04:30:42,649
Oh no, he's doing an evil villain rant

2102
04:31:32,360 --> 04:31:39,659
All right, 34 minutes. Eh, gotta shave a little time off gotta shave a little time off there

2103
04:31:54,250 --> 04:32:14,819
Oh, I didn't save it. That's not good. I just pressed a you can still do it here

2104
04:32:15,059 --> 04:32:30,870
Oh, well, I skipped the cutscene. I didn't mean to do that

2105
04:32:34,950 --> 04:32:54,620
Uh, all right any um, if I restart the mission will we see it? God damn it

2106
04:33:04,330 --> 04:33:11,500
Uh, I don't know what happened, but we got to the top of the tower save save. I know I know

2107
04:33:18,979 --> 04:33:24,259
Wait, where do I save?

2108
04:33:24,259 --> 04:33:29,909
I can't save from here save quit and reload the save data in the menu

2109
04:33:30,729 --> 04:33:33,770
Yeah, but I didn't I everybody told me that this doesn't matter

2110
04:33:34,490 --> 04:33:37,560
Does it matter people? I I don't know whether to trust this or not

2111
04:33:37,639 --> 04:33:39,639
People said that mid mission doesn't really do anything doesn't it?

2112
04:33:44,630 --> 04:33:54,259
I was told never to use that it doesn't checkpoint, but it does save

2113
04:33:54,340 --> 04:34:21,750
Okay, I don't have to fight I can get the cutscene from the main menu

2114
04:34:22,069 --> 04:35:21,509
All right. We actually have to fight now. I feel like it's been an hour since I've attacked an enemy come here already dead

2115
04:35:21,590 --> 04:35:43,220
Okay, cool. Hey dude, can you discharge a firearm or do your red explosive barrel again? It was really funny the first time

2116
04:35:44,500 --> 04:35:49,220
God damn it. I don't want to be the guy that's known as the loud guy. Oh, I already am

2117
04:35:58,200 --> 04:36:43,909
All right, let's get out of here. This thing's a lot lighter. No

2118
04:36:44,549 --> 04:37:27,220
Is it gone

2119
04:37:46,549 --> 04:38:24,939
Where even is this thing stay locked on when it goes off screen? I can't see it i'm going for this hit it

2120
04:38:30,599 --> 04:39:56,220
Fuck those things. Okay, I got an item boom stuck right in the middle. Oh, no, I didn't want to press that

2121
04:40:11,080 --> 04:40:19,159
Living statue room. All right, so I have this item. Does the item go in this pedestal?

2122
04:40:19,400 --> 04:40:36,220
Oh, there's plenty of places I haven't gone

2123
04:40:36,540 --> 04:40:48,439
The question is what door should I go in next i'm gonna say I have to go this way back into the

2124
04:40:50,819 --> 04:40:55,380
What's in here? Okay, so I gotta go all the way to the end

2125
04:41:11,540 --> 04:41:31,349
Now I need to go either one of these doors works. How much money do I have not enough dante versus deadpool who wins

2126
04:41:31,669 --> 04:41:36,419
It's an easy one

2127
04:41:36,419 --> 04:42:44,580
Uh, probably dante. All right. Good. All right. I gotta kill this guy now. He's annoying. Where are you?

2128
04:42:44,819 --> 04:43:32,380
Have you been spawning people devil star? Ooh, all right, anything else in here? Okay

2129
04:43:34,340 --> 04:43:49,209
So there's another door on the end here wait over here. So this is here

2130
04:43:50,650 --> 04:44:01,909
All right. I want to go back and then go to the end of this hole chamber of sin

2131
04:44:02,389 --> 04:44:11,939
He who pursues the onyx moon shard make whole the spheres. I want that

2132
04:44:35,349 --> 04:45:46,380
Okay, so I don't think you break these bounce into each other. Oh shit right when it went down. What the fuck

2133
04:46:01,659 --> 04:46:09,880
Ah, ah, huh? They're touching. Why are they not breaking into each other?

2134
04:46:24,919 --> 04:46:38,310
Ah, yes, I did it moon shard cool

2135
04:47:08,819 --> 04:47:16,650
Dude, you I I I hate these things. You are so fucking annoying

2136
04:47:24,119 --> 04:47:28,540
What is i'm gonna lose?

2137
04:47:28,779 --> 04:47:51,880
Okay, well at least I don't have to do this again

2138
04:48:02,139 --> 04:48:07,400
I'm just gonna do this because I refuse to fight these enemies. I refuse

2139
04:48:08,119 --> 04:48:31,560
Spam the air kick. Um, that's what I tried to start doing

2140
04:48:33,029 --> 04:49:12,709
But they just float around so much. You can't even get like a fucking line on them. Why can these enemies fly?

2141
04:49:27,610 --> 04:49:29,610
You and you shouldn't be able to go in the ground

2142
04:49:33,880 --> 04:49:35,880
Bro fight me out of the fucking puddle

2143
04:50:06,869 --> 04:50:25,669
Now I want to go around the corner and down when you're gonna start the granny game marathon

2144
04:50:25,909 --> 04:51:14,139
The uh, we were here before the ice guardians chamber, but what's going on?

2145
04:51:14,540 --> 04:51:28,840
Do I have any thoughts on what do more attacks than the spinning jump one? I don't but

2146
04:51:29,770 --> 04:51:31,720
It's okay

2147
04:51:31,720 --> 04:51:38,220
This game when you move forward and press attack you do that move. You have to stand completely still which

2148
04:51:39,159 --> 04:51:41,580
Retraining your brain to not have your thumb on the stick

2149
04:51:42,299 --> 04:52:09,259
Very hard. I mean there's a door here. I just tried to do that

2150
04:52:43,669 --> 04:52:49,619
Nowhere. Hey, dude, you're gonna finish mafia 3

2151
04:52:53,720 --> 04:53:18,500
Damn, that's enough. That's an old one. I played mafia 3 for like three hours or something dinner giant walker chamber

2152
04:53:18,819 --> 04:53:44,409
Yeah, we're really going kind of through the whole first part of the game. Hey, here we are

2153
04:53:45,750 --> 04:54:00,919
This thing is moving now. I gotta build up some more

2154
04:54:01,479 --> 04:54:23,529
Souls here. Okay, so this thing's moving any weird shit up here or anything

2155
04:54:25,430 --> 04:55:02,330
No, okay, leave one other way to go stand back the hell you can't do something you can reason with

2156
04:55:03,479 --> 04:55:06,439
It has nothing to do with me being a human and you being a demon

2157
04:55:08,150 --> 04:55:13,979
I'm driven inability to forgive him. My soul is screaming demanding me to kill him

2158
04:55:15,020 --> 04:55:18,810
That's enough motivation to keep me going

2159
04:55:22,259 --> 04:55:25,860
Besides, this is my family matter. You should stay out of it

2160
04:55:26,740 --> 04:55:31,880
Okay, lady, I get them. I can't just sit back and watch either

2161
04:55:32,729 --> 04:55:43,240
I'm pretty pissed at him too. You know now get out of my way or there'll be some consequences fair enough

2162
04:55:44,200 --> 04:55:46,599
I wasn't planning on letting any demons. Uh-oh

2163
04:55:47,240 --> 04:55:49,240
I'm gonna get my ass kicked. Aren't I?

2164
04:55:49,240 --> 04:56:14,819
All right, first try let me do it. I'll get it first try where she's freaking me out

2165
04:56:24,259 --> 04:56:27,700
Shooting at the voices. No, I yeah hers

2166
04:56:47,770 --> 04:56:49,930

2167
04:57:36,470 --> 04:57:38,470
Get her caught get her caught caught caught get her caught

2168
04:58:01,930 --> 04:59:20,619
Good you my weapons are so bad. All right, I just need to wait. Oh my god you

2169
04:59:21,180 --> 04:59:48,540
Coward, let's go. I can't look up where she is either. I just have to find her. Where are you?

2170
05:00:09,400 --> 05:01:20,919
Don't you have a shit in me? You are so annoying. Will you fight me and stop running you keep doing the

2171
05:01:21,400 --> 05:01:31,849
Claw the hook whatever up to the ceiling and then I can't you're doing like the hook claw thing. Whatever it is

2172
05:01:52,709 --> 05:01:54,549
Oh my god

2173
05:01:54,549 --> 05:01:56,549
Please just get on

2174
05:02:14,439 --> 05:02:29,259
I'm just gonna wait

2175
05:02:29,259 --> 05:02:47,990
I'm just gonna literally stand. I'm just gonna stand back here. She's gonna run away every time. Oh, hi. Yeah

2176
05:02:50,740 --> 05:03:17,619
Oh, well, sorry, you gotta go. I really don't want to do this again

2177
05:03:36,569 --> 05:04:14,939
Okay, thank god you did wait I did marge and homer in the same fight I did the whole family

2178
05:04:58,459 --> 05:05:14,009
Ooh new weapon

05:05:55,270 --> 05:05:58,919
God damn it

2180
05:05:58,919 --> 05:06:07,189
It's just I looked over at the mod chat and I just see mischief makers. Did I win? Oh shit

2181
05:06:17,240 --> 05:06:40,439
All right. Cool. Gotta get them all. Oh

2182
05:06:41,159 --> 05:07:13,080
I want that it's worth it only um, what three more chapters?

2183
05:07:15,700 --> 05:07:41,060
All right, I need to stop this take away two minutes that just took me to do that

2184
05:07:46,700 --> 05:07:49,659
Okay

2185
05:07:49,659 --> 05:08:00,650
Okay, that's a b one of the reasons I didn't use an item back there is because it was gonna be s

2186
05:08:50,360 --> 05:08:57,450
Uh-oh combine the oh, do I get that weapon? Oh, oh, oh, oh

2187
05:09:00,299 --> 05:09:33,860
Do I actually get to use this? Oh, that's devil may cry one. I think I want to make a few changes

2188
05:09:34,259 --> 05:09:38,580
This thing is amazing. But I just don't activate it

2189
05:09:43,130 --> 05:09:47,419
I think i'll go with sword master and then also

2190
05:09:52,340 --> 05:10:08,000
I'm curious about this

2191
05:10:08,000 --> 05:10:09,680

Uh, so what's the correct way in the door the high? Yeah, I was here already

2194
05:10:37,299 --> 05:11:13,139
No wrong. I can go this way, but wait only I had the double jump. Oh, this is a place to go

2195
05:11:13,380 --> 05:11:16,069
Trial of the warrior. Okay

2196
05:11:37,200 --> 05:12:25,409
All right, let's do it activate it again. All right

Is he concentrating? I am

2202
05:15:48,639 --> 05:15:51,250
I feel like you have to in a game like this. Otherwise, you're just gonna die

2203
05:15:57,029 --> 05:16:05,669
All right, it's gonna show up here in a second

2204
05:16:05,669 --> 05:16:07,270

2205
05:16:07,270 --> 05:16:56,159
All right, turn it back on move. All right. Now, let's go

2206
05:16:56,799 --> 05:17:42,549
Do I have to my god? What the hell dude? Why do I have to do this?

2207
05:17:43,189 --> 05:18:09,840

hundred

2212
05:18:58,229 --> 05:19:16,790
Million times and he's still alive. Did you do the million stab?

2213
05:19:17,509 --> 05:19:22,799
I feel like the opportunity for those combos is like close to zero because i'll get in i'll be like here

2214
05:19:22,799 --> 05:19:41,619
Okay, here comes the step and i'll just get hit

I'm dead. It's optional. Well, I I have to beat it. I'm right there

2221
05:24:11,139 --> 05:24:15,880

Yeah, I don't want to grab a hold of that thing

2225
05:25:51,619 --> 05:26:24,080
Get away from me. No

2230
05:27:27,650 --> 05:27:32,900

Hit the wheels if I go to the wheels he goes

2232
05:27:45,880 --> 05:27:48,279
It's just as it fucking sucks

2233
05:27:48,840 --> 05:28:27,009
Okay

2234
05:28:27,009 --> 05:28:47,799

2235
05:28:48,520 --> 05:29:03,119
They just do it. So can somebody are they invincible if they if these are both not active?

2236
05:29:03,680 --> 05:29:13,319
Okay, let's go you fucking asshole

2237
05:29:57,680 --> 05:30:00,639
Get away from me for one second, dude

2238
05:30:04,549 --> 05:30:06,549
Don't he's gonna do it again. Oh

2239
05:30:06,869 --> 05:30:11,409
Oh my god

2240
05:30:24,709 --> 05:30:26,709
Just you open it

2241
05:30:40,959 --> 05:30:42,959
Let me just turn it on

2242
05:30:54,709 --> 05:31:13,799
Dude, I keep getting trapped in front of him. I don't even have any heels. I don't have any heels. I have to do this

2243
05:31:23,400 --> 05:31:25,400
What the hell is this enemy?

2244
05:31:25,779 --> 05:31:27,459
And why is it like this?

2245
05:31:27,459 --> 05:31:34,049
You don't even have an opportunity to attack this motherfucker before he just like to start to start teleporting around again

2246
05:31:34,450 --> 05:31:49,860
I just didn't want to die

2247
05:31:50,340 --> 05:32:04,209
Just walk behind him

2248
05:32:06,909 --> 05:32:11,990
Overtuned overtuned overtuned overtuned overtuned

2249
05:32:17,729 --> 05:32:20,130
Yeah, I know he's invincible but there is

2250
05:32:20,930 --> 05:32:25,569
Not a single opportunity where I can go turn on two fucking pirate wheels

2251
05:32:26,450 --> 05:32:28,450
He's he just doesn't stop attacking

2252
05:33:20,150 --> 05:33:22,150
I'm gonna turn the other

2253
05:33:22,150 --> 05:34:15,080
Turn the other pirate wheel can't dodge correctly. He does this move way too often

2254
05:34:17,060 --> 05:34:37,040
Way way too often. He does this move 10 times too often and now the thing's back to zero again. This is awful

2255
05:35:06,869 --> 05:35:09,430
This sucks absolute asshole. It really does

2256
05:35:17,560 --> 05:35:19,880
I there's no opportunity to fight this guy

2257
05:35:20,759 --> 05:35:24,680
You're either smacking a wheel or he's teleporting around the whole map and just screaming at you

2258
05:35:25,240 --> 05:35:53,240
But here we go again just admit you can't do it. It's a skill issue. It's a game issue

2259
05:35:53,639 --> 05:36:17,639
So how much less damage do I actually do to people I feel like I should have killed that guy by now

2260
05:36:24,599 --> 05:36:28,919
I mean, that's an unbelievable reduction in how these guys i'm i'm hitting the same guy

2261
05:36:29,639 --> 05:37:18,150
I have an idea every single enemy in this game have to have teleport

2262
05:37:18,389 --> 05:37:51,159
But they have to put that in for almost every enemy in the game teleport. See you later. All right, he's back

2263
05:37:51,639 --> 05:38:20,950
Oh my why does he parry every move in the front and then he teleports fuck this guy

2264
05:38:21,669 --> 05:38:58,950
Dude stop appearing underneath me and then I this is so bad

2265
05:39:03,090 --> 05:39:22,520
This is bad

2266
05:39:22,520 --> 05:39:26,419
Where is he going?

2267
05:39:26,419 --> 05:39:28,419
Fuck this guy and fuck this game

2268
05:39:28,740 --> 05:39:52,229
I'm killing him right now

2269
05:39:52,310 --> 05:39:59,270
This is unbelievably awful on a scale of one to ten. This is at least an eight. This is at least an eight

2270
05:40:18,610 --> 05:40:22,610
Why do they have to teleport every single three seconds?

2271
05:40:23,009 --> 05:40:27,240
Do they have to teleport after every swing?

2272
05:40:27,880 --> 05:40:29,880
after every fucking swing

2273
05:40:34,819 --> 05:40:36,819
I can't but i'm so done

2274
05:40:40,979 --> 05:40:47,380
And I just replaced the thing that I just used so it was for no reason to come in here

2275
05:40:47,619 --> 05:41:44,389
Here comes another mald's

2276
05:41:45,110 --> 05:41:49,330
Oh, no

2277
05:41:49,799 --> 05:42:40,709
I'm gonna be fine. I'm gonna be fine. Don't worry. Let's go. Not another one. Where are you?

2278
05:43:04,580 --> 05:43:55,459
Move ah, I feel like i'm in sludge half the time. Isn't that it? All right, you're gonna have a breakdown

2279
05:43:55,540 --> 05:44:14,930
No, i'm good. I'm good. So where the hell am I going? I I have to put the

2280
05:44:15,959 --> 05:44:26,849
Loud weapon on I feel like I was better with it. I sort of be careful or maybe the beowulf maybe

2281
05:44:34,740 --> 05:44:39,729
Uh, I have 20 000

2282
05:44:45,240 --> 05:44:50,209
Uh, I think it's air hike but what this

2283
05:44:59,479 --> 05:45:11,430
Yeah, so it's why why pause?

2284
05:45:12,150 --> 05:45:21,060
And then there it is. Okay, this dude bought air hike twice. I don't know what i'm doing

2285
05:45:21,909 --> 05:45:40,500
Yeah, but I don't want to use those swords anymore. Um

2286
05:45:43,169 --> 05:45:50,479
Do I want to keep this on where do I want to go back to trickster?

2287
05:45:50,959 --> 05:46:06,529
I feel like trickster is very helpful. I think that's the right call

2288
05:46:17,110 --> 05:46:18,549
There we go. Nice

2289
05:46:18,549 --> 05:46:56,040
Okay from here. There's nowhere else to go. I guess we're going back. I gotta go back up the cubes

2290
05:46:56,200 --> 05:47:21,430
This is not as bad as you guys think it's gonna be for me. I promise

2291
05:47:28,639 --> 05:47:31,759
I know a lot of you are expecting. Oh, wow. I can't wait. He's gonna fuck up everything

2292
05:47:32,000 --> 05:48:03,490
I'm gonna be all right right here so far. So good weird. Okay, I can go up here

2293
05:48:03,490 --> 05:48:26,819
Here

2294
05:48:26,819 --> 05:48:48,720
It really is the horror, okay now there was a trick to this it was four

2295
05:48:58,450 --> 05:49:01,349
Do I need to do this though? I feel like I don't need to do this

2296
05:49:01,909 --> 05:49:07,159
But I guess i'm oh my god

2297
05:49:07,799 --> 05:49:22,389
Wow

2298
05:49:22,389 --> 05:50:01,509
I got really lucky there. Did I do it? All right, we're getting close. Do I need to fight these? Maybe not I do

2299
05:50:34,580 --> 05:50:49,490
You're in for a cool boss fight, I'd love to hear it. Is it why pause why why or is it why pause why pause then that?

2300
05:50:50,369 --> 05:51:30,419
Okay, that's that it's why why why why why pause why why why why why good to know all right onto the big bridge

2301
05:51:30,659 --> 05:51:54,529
It's fine. All right, let's do it

2302
05:52:35,080 --> 05:52:37,080
Time to fight my shadow

2303
05:52:39,759 --> 05:52:41,200
This would be easy

2304
05:52:41,200 --> 05:52:47,880
Have you are you learning from all my moves because I got a d in every single level so this should not be hard at all

2305
05:52:57,270 --> 05:52:59,439
Oh, I can't hurt him. Uh

2306
05:53:02,520 --> 05:53:08,130
Oh, you don't like the light, okay, I get it go over to the light this lights this place up

2307
05:53:29,599 --> 05:53:30,880
Oh

2308
05:53:30,880 --> 05:54:07,330
Dude, you've ripped his skin off. I didn't do anything. No you come to me

2309
05:54:20,180 --> 05:55:07,959
I wasn't locked on I was holding bright trigger big damage. That's right. No

2310
05:55:09,080 --> 05:55:57,479
Come on really that I actually wasted it. That wasn't bad. Oh, no

2311
05:56:02,799 --> 05:56:15,009
Oh, yes, doppelganger special power used by the doppelganger enemy the style gives you more freedom to battle

2312
05:56:15,729 --> 05:56:25,360
Not a style. Okay

2313
05:56:25,360 --> 05:56:27,360
Give me a couple of new

2314
05:56:27,360 --> 05:56:34,500
Things to mess around with here right at the end of the game. Oh

2315
05:56:49,970 --> 05:57:04,319
We're just getting worse and worse 40 minutes

2316
05:57:04,720 --> 05:57:30,209
Well, it was 40 minutes because I spent at least 25 doing that stupid wheel encounter 18 invading hell

2317
05:57:31,080 --> 05:57:33,319
Break the seal and battle into the depths

2318
05:57:55,720 --> 05:58:25,000
Whoa, I have to fight the whole chess board. Do I have any pieces?

2319
05:58:42,950 --> 05:58:57,139
Lock on to this thing if they get to the end of the board. Do I lose?

2320
05:58:57,380 --> 05:59:19,639
I feel like that's what it's implying here

2321
05:59:40,779 --> 06:00:46,819
Everybody's come on. Yeah, that hurts so much. Get it. Does everything have to have a move that goes?

2322
06:00:48,450 --> 06:00:52,549
And then dashes across the screen

2323
06:00:52,869 --> 06:01:16,520
I've seen a theme here

2324
06:01:16,520 --> 06:01:28,209
Okay, I just have to vote. I'm gonna stay in the fists. It's way more damage

2325
06:01:29,840 --> 06:01:34,159
I gotta clear them out as fast as possible starting go one two three. What side happens first?

2326
06:01:39,409 --> 06:01:47,509
Can't combo just gets broken. I wish I had like some kind of

2327
06:02:13,279 --> 06:02:16,159
Don't lock on to random shit that's in the way, please

2328
06:02:16,639 --> 06:02:28,869
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I still got hit by it

2329
06:03:15,009 --> 06:03:40,930
All right, who's left you just come over here already

2330
06:04:03,680 --> 06:04:08,400
Dude, check this tutorial. No, this is fucking crap. This is crap

2331
06:04:09,220 --> 06:04:11,220
This is crap

2332
06:04:24,000 --> 06:04:25,680
That's what dad says

2333
06:04:25,680 --> 06:04:32,319
Do you give dad the controller for like gta or something?

2334
06:04:33,349 --> 06:04:39,750
I drive all the time. He's going 20 miles per hour down every single road. He's hitting every single car

2335
06:04:40,310 --> 06:04:43,590
He doesn't get it. It just goes this is not something. This is crap

2336
06:04:46,240 --> 06:05:13,619
This is crap. So

2337
06:05:13,619 --> 06:05:15,619
Holy shit, I did it

2338
06:05:22,930 --> 06:05:36,229
This is crap

2339
06:05:36,229 --> 06:05:52,880
Yeah, at least watch the rest on youtube. Okay

2340
06:06:01,240 --> 06:06:09,380
I'm curious about it

2341
06:06:09,380 --> 06:06:11,380
What is oh

2342
06:06:11,540 --> 06:06:13,619
Okay, you want me to do this now?

2343
06:06:34,229 --> 06:07:23,090
Probably not a great weapon for this. All right. This is what I wanted to do. I didn't how did I not hurt him at all?

2344
06:07:23,409 --> 06:07:51,509
How do I call on the other dante?

2345
06:07:51,669 --> 06:08:28,770
No, they're still coming in ice

2346
06:08:29,250 --> 06:08:59,439
Changing the targets makes me want to throw up. I'm gonna lose

2347
06:09:21,540 --> 06:09:22,500
Oops

2348
06:09:22,500 --> 06:09:35,959
Okay, uh, I see a couple things wrong already. These weapons are not for this fight

2349
06:09:36,520 --> 06:09:38,439
Putting we're putting on

2350
06:09:38,439 --> 06:09:46,959
these

2351
06:09:46,959 --> 06:09:48,799
and I want

2352
06:09:48,880 --> 06:09:57,439
Uh, I don't want this

2353
06:09:57,439 --> 06:09:59,439
I was burping. I wasn't crying

2354
06:10:18,979 --> 06:11:12,259
Way better. We're i'm hearing those explosions again, and it's kind of freaking me out. Whoa

2355
06:11:27,860 --> 06:11:43,029
Get it only got to kill like four more of those or way more than that

2356
06:11:43,349 --> 06:11:47,639
Do I have to kill every single boss in the game?

2357
06:11:47,639 --> 06:11:55,409
This is gonna stink. Isn't it? This is gonna stink. Who's this one?

2358
06:11:59,029 --> 06:12:00,950
Oh, no

2359
06:12:00,950 --> 06:12:58,319
Are you doing are you gonna beat the game tonight? I plan on it. I'm gonna try to come here

2360
06:12:58,639 --> 06:13:19,700
I gotta hit these guys in the back too. It's just it's it's just it's you know what I mean like

2361
06:13:20,340 --> 06:14:16,450
This is crap

2362
06:14:16,450 --> 06:14:20,450
One move andy it's the only move I can do but they just run so far away

2363
06:14:20,529 --> 06:14:30,080
They jump around dash around and I've I've hit him and they just back back up back up fight me

2364
06:15:02,500 --> 06:15:04,740
He's royal guard idiot

2365
06:15:05,700 --> 06:16:27,729
Time that person off for one second. I don't even start. Yes. All right, who's the worst boss that I don't want to fight right now?

2366
06:16:28,450 --> 06:16:40,919
I don't want to fight her right now. What's this one?

2367
06:16:45,759 --> 06:16:49,200
Dude, why did I pick the right one bite gem and you're done. What do you mean? I'm done

2368
06:16:50,159 --> 06:17:41,599
Am I actually done if I do this? I forget the combo for this way too slow. Why space? Why space? Why? Okay

2369
06:18:34,020 --> 06:19:41,729
I'm dead. God damn it. Unfortunately. I have a question if I

2370
06:19:42,610 --> 06:19:46,759
Use this orb I come back if I die here

2371
06:19:47,319 --> 06:19:53,360
And I reset do I have to fight the other two bosses in a row very important distinction

2372
06:19:58,799 --> 06:20:02,689
No, okay. Thank you so much. Appreciate the uh

2373
06:20:11,560 --> 06:20:16,610
Whoa, who's this one?

2374
06:20:18,020 --> 06:20:20,020
Oh this so I can do this one. This one's easy

2375
06:20:50,689 --> 06:21:08,319
That's taking way more hits now. They're all buffed up. Ah

2376
06:21:17,459 --> 06:22:02,919
Damn it really, you know, let me get a combo in I didn't get it. Shit

2377
06:22:05,319 --> 06:22:15,779
Really twice in a row. I didn't get it. It's annoying. I'll get it this time

2378
06:22:16,259 --> 06:22:47,169
What a waste what a waste I can cancel it

2379
06:22:48,150 --> 06:23:00,610
I didn't even know that till literally the last 10 minutes of the game. How come he keeps

2380
06:23:01,169 --> 06:23:38,209
Flipping back. When do I get the opportunity to actually attack him? All the lights gotta be up. Don't it?

2381
06:23:38,209 --> 06:23:41,569
Why I'm gonna attack him here. I shouldn't even do it get all the lights

2382
06:24:02,400 --> 06:24:11,270
Wait, I thought he turned that one off. He shot a beam. I thought he turned it off across the way. He threw it

2383
06:24:12,740 --> 06:24:16,259
He did his move. He turned he threw the projectile. I thought he turned it off

2384
06:24:23,830 --> 06:24:27,590
Yeah, he did that. I what does it just disappear if it if you actually turn all the lights on

2385
06:24:28,310 --> 06:25:25,090
Anyone I wanted the health don't throw. I won't come over here. Okay, we got him 15k. Nice anymore heals

2386
06:25:25,409 --> 06:25:36,130
I don't want to go on this with half health. I wonder if this anymore

2387
06:25:41,840 --> 06:25:46,240
Who's this? Oh, no, no, no. No, I thought this was a this was a giant one. I was like, oh cool

2388
06:25:46,319 --> 06:25:50,520
What's this big one? I think I should just die here

2389
06:25:52,400 --> 06:25:56,040
Just kill me because I just want the full health to fight the white door

2390
06:26:06,849 --> 06:26:11,759
If I just have to do the white one then why is there a point to do all them or no?

2391
06:26:11,919 --> 06:26:28,049
I'm going the wrong way was I going you'll get more red orbs

2392
06:26:31,990 --> 06:26:33,669
Let's just get this guy

2393
06:26:33,669 --> 06:27:57,729
Come on, man. I didn't want to even dodge towards him again, but you know how it is. I got so greedy

2394
06:27:58,209 --> 06:29:09,479
And I still am greedy. Fuck it. Just where is he? No go go go go

2395
06:29:12,689 --> 06:29:21,970
Thank god. All right. I did it

2396
06:29:22,450 --> 06:29:39,090
I was gonna say that's not a lot. So that's three. I've made a circle

2397
06:29:44,919 --> 06:29:50,520
Well, i'm really glad you guys told me that because I definitely would have tried to fight every single enemy in this game

2398
06:29:50,919 --> 06:30:23,909
Circle like it connected them in a you know, whatever i'm tired. Wait, did this guy know?

2399
06:30:24,229 --> 06:30:46,560
I feel like i'm gonna have a great time

2400
06:30:46,720 --> 06:31:25,520
All right. This is 19 out of 20. How do you eat blue cheese? It tastes like puke

2401
06:31:25,759 --> 06:31:55,970
How do you eat goat cheese? It tastes like dirt and say that too popple the great beast with bates bullet great beast

2402
06:32:49,279 --> 06:33:56,630
All right. Where's the great beast 26 000. Damn. Come here new zone

2403
06:34:00,069 --> 06:34:02,069
All right. It's just a gauntlet

2404
06:34:08,919 --> 06:34:12,200
All right, I can't hit these guys

2405
06:34:12,200 --> 06:34:15,680
what is

2406
06:34:15,680 --> 06:34:18,240
Substance projects image and image punishes substance

2407
06:34:18,959 --> 06:34:21,479
Do I have to hit them in the mirror?

2408
06:34:21,479 --> 06:34:57,560
Excuse me

2409
06:34:57,560 --> 06:35:18,319
Stop the vicious circle by bending time and space looks like something can be inserted here. Something can be inserted here

2410
06:35:18,720 --> 06:35:26,279
Back to some of the mirror opposite this one

2411
06:35:26,840 --> 06:36:06,930
Stop the vicious circle by bending time and space. Can I do it do more than one?

2412
06:36:42,959 --> 06:36:51,029
another one

2413
06:36:51,029 --> 06:36:55,240
27 000

2414
06:36:55,240 --> 06:37:24,520
I need a kiosk or whatever. They are can't hurt them. Okay. Oh, I can hurt them. All right

2415
06:37:24,919 --> 06:39:17,349
Here we go. Not bad. Did I do it? I got it. I failed it really fuck. Okay. Hold on dude. How many more combos?

2416
06:39:17,909 --> 06:39:46,639
He died already god. Damn it

2417
06:39:49,669 --> 06:39:58,020
Die, please

2418
06:39:58,020 --> 06:40:02,419
Is he dead? Did I do it? Oh, yes

2419
06:40:02,900 --> 06:40:21,700
I had a triple s going almost that whole time and still took him almost to the end. I wonder what the last boss is

2420
06:40:22,180 --> 06:40:49,509
I bet it's a cube

2421
06:40:49,509 --> 06:40:50,150
All right

2422
06:40:50,150 --> 06:41:13,270
It's time to upgrade one more time one more blue orb or get a gold orb

2423
06:41:13,430 --> 06:41:31,240
I think this is going to be a big deal. This is what I would do and then

2424
06:41:32,689 --> 06:41:46,130
Get stream level two you already had one. I can't resurrect twice

2425
06:41:46,770 --> 06:41:56,639
And you're only right. Yeah, you can. Yeah, i'm just giving myself some padding

2426
06:42:07,619 --> 06:42:18,819
I mean, this is the correct answer, right? I guess I could do another blue orb or that what do you think blue orb or

2427
06:42:19,380 --> 06:42:31,009
level two to that

2428
06:42:31,330 --> 06:42:55,159
Okay, gotta heal now. This is it right the road to despair. This is not right go in the mirror. Wait

2429
06:42:55,880 --> 06:43:21,200
Didn't I come out of that mirror I came out of that one didn't I oh shit, okay

2430
06:43:21,520 --> 06:43:46,770
So not here go back in the mirror. I just went in the mirror. Wait. What is again? Wait, how much?

2431
06:44:04,560 --> 06:44:06,799
statue I have

2432
06:44:07,360 --> 06:44:10,310
I need to put the thing in the staff

2433
06:44:10,630 --> 06:44:29,909
I I feel like that was a hundred years ago. Okay. All right. Now we go back in here

2434
06:44:32,790 --> 06:45:01,509
End of the line. All right. I already spent things cool. Okay final boss maybe

2435
06:45:01,750 --> 06:45:51,639
Yeah

2436
06:45:51,639 --> 06:45:55,729
Okay, big giant enemy

2437
06:45:56,130 --> 06:45:58,369
Imagining go attack big giant enemies legs

2438
06:45:59,090 --> 06:46:02,959
Big enemy will fall down hit enemy and face

2439
06:46:24,400 --> 06:47:10,159
All right, let's do it. Not bad damage. We're good. Jesus you have to attack these

2440
06:47:10,880 --> 06:47:15,169
What are they doing? They're about to fucking snipe me

2441
06:47:47,240 --> 06:48:20,130
All right. Let's see. I got some good healing out of that. Your loadout is ass. I'm busy

2442
06:48:20,529 --> 06:48:48,610
I'm a little busy right now, dude

2443
06:48:50,159 --> 06:49:02,290
What is the strategy here rocket?

2444
06:49:02,849 --> 06:49:05,189
me

2445
06:49:05,189 --> 06:49:07,189
Oh my god. Okay. Well

2446
06:49:07,349 --> 06:49:22,770
That was fun

2447
06:49:22,770 --> 06:49:26,279
I tried to hit select to open up the fucking menu

2448
06:49:37,880 --> 06:49:42,680
It's it's up on the d-pad and I have not been able to put that into my memory

2449
06:49:43,400 --> 06:49:47,319
It's the only game in history that's ever had up on the d-pad be go to the menu

2450
06:49:47,479 --> 06:49:52,419
There's no it hasn't been a single game in history that's done that and not in all of history

2451
06:50:37,720 --> 06:51:06,000
Okay. All right, bring out the bugs again. What are the hell they are?

2452
06:51:33,840 --> 06:51:50,599
Okay, um, why would I ever be locked on to that are you fucking serious? Why would it lock on?

2453
06:51:51,159 --> 06:52:09,720
To the and I don't even kill it because when you lock on you

2454
06:52:10,279 --> 06:52:12,279
D, uh, you know what? I was gonna whatever

2455
06:52:12,759 --> 06:53:18,000

Do we get to play together can I switch between them?

2457
06:53:51,700 --> 06:54:05,380
He needs to learn the heart of battle of brothers

2458
06:54:05,939 --> 06:54:08,389
Okay

2459
06:54:08,389 --> 06:54:12,470
Where's your fall is dante's lead but still spins off his own special style

2460
06:54:13,189 --> 06:54:16,319

So no more demon form. Oh my god. I'm almost dead

06:54:26,470 --> 06:54:51,029
Go. Oh, I don't have a dodge anymore. I got this virgin. Watch out

2463
06:55:10,000 --> 06:56:00,500
Go. Whoa, a lot not more of this shit again. How do how is it possible to miss? That's like

2464
06:56:01,220 --> 06:56:04,819
Just six pixels where you can't hit one of those things and I found it

2465
06:56:05,619 --> 06:56:18,450
Uh-oh

2466
06:56:18,450 --> 06:56:24,639
What my virgin? I'm coming back. I'm coming back

2467
06:56:25,360 --> 06:56:27,360
Virgil don't worry. I'm coming back

06:56:27,970 --> 06:56:29,970
I have the free to play currency

2469
06:56:30,209 --> 06:56:41,220
I love this one of these little shits just still here

2470
06:56:53,000 --> 06:56:55,000
Oh my god

2471
06:56:56,470 --> 06:56:58,470
Please just end it

2472
06:57:00,819 --> 06:57:02,819
Virgil do a fucking suplex

2473
06:57:03,619 --> 06:57:26,979
Hey, hey, hey, put me down. Hey, hey

What hold on i'm so what happened you shitting me?

2475
06:57:34,340 --> 06:57:36,340
I didn't know that's what was going on

2476
06:57:37,189 --> 06:57:38,790
No, first, okay

2477
06:57:38,790 --> 06:57:40,790
Turn around right now

2478
06:57:41,029 --> 06:57:46,639
Attack him

2479
06:57:46,639 --> 06:57:48,639
I didn't know that's what was happening

2480
06:57:48,720 --> 06:57:50,720
Oh my god, please

2481
06:57:56,680 --> 06:57:58,360
How did you fall for it again?

2482
06:57:58,360 --> 06:58:03,159
Dude, I had 10 I had one hp when he picked me up the first time and it killed me instantly

2483
06:58:03,880 --> 06:59:13,990
Oh, no

2484
06:59:13,990 --> 06:59:15,990
Classy for someone's dying words

2485
06:59:27,680 --> 06:59:49,439
Oh the sword there it is

2486
06:59:50,459 --> 06:59:53,400
dscdc

2487
06:59:53,400 --> 06:59:55,400
Well, whatever it is i'm

2488
06:59:55,720 --> 06:59:58,979
incredibly unprepared for it

2489
06:59:58,979 --> 07:00:01,380
Considering I just had to use two of those golden orbs

2490
07:00:02,770 --> 07:00:08,069
I hope this final encounter is the same encounter that capcom puts in all their games

2491
07:00:08,959 --> 07:00:52,610
Which is just aim the rocket launcher at the big scary thing and press a turn back to the jester

2492
07:00:53,009 --> 07:01:08,340
This is actually the hardest fight in the franchise coming up here

2493
07:01:08,580 --> 07:01:26,759
Oh, no. Oh, this is gonna be I got it. I'm not going in with a negative attitude. It's not happening

2494
07:02:09,569 --> 07:02:18,520
All right, i'm gonna try to do a world record here for this stream no no complaining for 10 minutes

2495
07:02:19,520 --> 07:02:21,680
That would be a world record in a hard game

2496
07:02:22,639 --> 07:02:35,669
No complaining for 10 minutes straight and you bet on that. Yeah, sure. I'll try as hard as I can

2497
07:02:37,750 --> 07:02:40,229
I will not complain will I complain?

2498
07:02:41,189 --> 07:02:46,150
And by the way me saying what the fuck is that? What is this move? Oh, this is bull. This is bullshit

2499
07:02:47,029 --> 07:02:52,880
No, we're talking about I have to sincerely be like and why does he teleport? That's not fair. Why does he have a dash?

2500
07:02:54,919 --> 07:03:02,529
All in or no, okay. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. I will not make a single complaint

2501
07:03:03,090 --> 07:03:09,490
I'm gonna be super happy the whole time and run a poll if you want for 10 minutes

2502
07:03:10,439 --> 07:03:13,000
In 10 minutes in one second, I have completed the challenge

2503
07:03:21,119 --> 07:03:36,259
You have to eat a blt on stream if you complain. Okay. Yeah, that sounds fun. Yeah 10 minutes. Okay

2504
07:03:36,979 --> 07:03:38,979
Oh, I only have 15 000

2505
07:03:40,470 --> 07:03:46,040
No, it's I don't have enough

2506
07:03:46,040 --> 07:03:49,479
I've wasted that other one. I didn't I didn't know that was it

2507
07:03:50,400 --> 07:03:54,279
I have to buy these

2508
07:03:54,279 --> 07:03:56,680
No, no, no, no, no, no that we haven't started yet

2509
07:04:00,630 --> 07:04:02,869
We haven't started yet

2510
07:04:02,869 --> 07:04:04,950
Well, this is free money if you just are curious

2511
07:04:05,810 --> 07:04:10,529
This is a free channel point increase to whatever you have because there's no way right like I just I forgot

2512
07:04:11,720 --> 07:04:13,720
No, no, no, no. No, is that it?

2513
07:04:17,349 --> 07:04:20,500
Is it in are we good?

2514
07:04:20,500 --> 07:04:23,619
That wasn't a complaint. That was me expressing my sadness

2515
07:04:30,979 --> 07:04:51,840
I know i'm gonna buy one of these

2516
07:04:54,209 --> 07:04:56,209
And I know i'm gonna buy one of these

2517
07:05:04,919 --> 07:05:07,080
People are going all in. Oh boy

2518
07:05:09,650 --> 07:05:14,680
yeah, the timer can start from when the

2519
07:05:15,729 --> 07:05:20,450
Inevitable cutscene here ends and the actual boss health bar is on the bottom of the screen

2520
07:05:21,080 --> 07:05:25,139
That is when you can start the timer when boss's health bar is at the bottom of the screen

2521
07:05:33,700 --> 07:05:37,299
If you lose again, if you lose this you have to eat salt and vinegar chips as well

2522
07:05:39,330 --> 07:05:50,439
That's fine. Yeah blt with those chips. Yeah, sounds like a good lunch and goat cheese

2523
07:05:50,439 --> 07:05:54,819
No, I will I refuse. I will turn the stream off. I just I will I will run from that

2524
07:05:56,880 --> 07:06:04,020
We're not going goat cheese yet. I haven't even been it's having been 10 minutes. All right, here we go

2525
07:06:08,259 --> 07:06:10,259
I am going to use the weapons. I have right now

2526
07:06:11,779 --> 07:06:16,919
I am going to keep the trickster. Let's go

2527
07:06:19,520 --> 07:06:39,330
When I play hard games like this, I feel like half of my sentences are complaints

2528
07:06:41,360 --> 07:06:53,990
This is gonna be rough

2529
07:06:53,990 --> 07:06:55,990
Yeah, wait till the gameplay starts. We're not going yet

2530
07:07:15,860 --> 07:07:22,799
Don't even talk 10 minutes is a long time. What is it right now? It's 10 41 specific

2531
07:07:46,630 --> 07:07:48,630
Okay, here we go

2532
07:07:48,869 --> 07:07:50,150
begins now

2533
07:07:50,150 --> 07:07:51,430
Timer starts now

2534
07:07:51,430 --> 07:08:41,509
It almost just happened. No, i'm not muted. I promise he has health back just asking a question

2535
07:08:41,750 --> 07:08:44,790
I asked I was asking if he has his health back. It was a question

2536
07:08:46,610 --> 07:08:51,970
I was asking if he heals. That's not no, it's not i'm fine. I was just like thinking wait

2537
07:08:51,970 --> 07:08:54,610
Does he have his health back? Is this a heal mechanic?

2538
07:08:55,650 --> 07:09:15,299
That's all that was

2539
07:09:18,520 --> 07:10:27,919
Oh, he's in demon mode my turn getting really hard to not it's so difficult right now

2540
07:10:27,919 --> 07:10:46,720
I'm trying as hard as I can to not say anything. What do you mean a complaint? What are you talking about?

2541
07:10:46,720 --> 07:10:50,639
No, I said I'm trying really hard to not it's got to be a complaint

2542
07:10:51,599 --> 07:10:55,360
I have just said this is very difficult to not do this. That's no it's not

2543
07:10:55,919 --> 07:10:58,549
It's very difficult

2544
07:10:58,549 --> 07:10:59,810
and

2545
07:10:59,810 --> 07:11:01,810
I've noticed an observation

2546
07:11:07,590 --> 07:11:11,029
I'm just simply observing a few things

2547
07:11:11,669 --> 07:11:17,090
I'm not this is not a complaint. It's just I really need to get better at timing that dodge

2548
07:11:17,569 --> 07:11:24,080
I'm gonna own that one better at timing that dodge is what would have been good there

2549
07:11:24,240 --> 07:11:27,520
That's nothing to do with anything to do with what happened. We're good

2550
07:11:28,560 --> 07:11:31,139
It's about timing the dodge. That's all that was

2551
07:11:31,779 --> 07:12:00,790
I still have six minutes. I feel like that's a million years, which is an observation. It's just it feels like a long time

2552
07:12:04,849 --> 07:12:06,930
No, it's not. That's not a complaint

2553
07:12:09,360 --> 07:12:11,360
That's an observation

2554
07:12:14,259 --> 07:12:19,270
No, it's not

2555
07:12:19,270 --> 07:12:21,270
No, it has to be a complaint

2556
07:12:23,779 --> 07:12:26,259
Let me start over it. Let me start over it. Let me start over

2557
07:12:26,900 --> 07:12:33,619
I didn't complain. I just said man. That's that's such a four six more minutes. That's a long time

2558
07:12:34,500 --> 07:13:06,950
It is a long time

2559
07:13:28,080 --> 07:13:29,040
Just

2560
07:13:29,040 --> 07:13:32,529
Kill me

2561
07:13:32,529 --> 07:13:38,439
He heals he does heal that is what happens. It's an observation

2562
07:13:39,139 --> 07:13:52,130
That's a heal. That's a big heal

2563
07:13:53,299 --> 07:13:56,500
And it's fine. I don't have a problem with it a heal at all

2564
07:13:57,520 --> 07:13:58,639
See

2565
07:13:58,639 --> 07:14:02,240
It's like it doesn't even it doesn't even faze me doesn't even faze me

2566
07:14:25,729 --> 07:14:52,099
Doesn't even faze me right now

2567
07:14:56,580 --> 07:14:58,500
Hey virgil that was

2568
07:14:58,500 --> 07:15:04,900
Just an observation. That was a pretty very long demon form. I'm up just observing that I don't care at all

2569
07:15:04,979 --> 07:15:07,060
By the way, I am i'm fine with that

2570
07:15:08,450 --> 07:15:14,689
Just an observation that was a pretty long demon mode. That was very interesting. I'm very interested by what I just saw

2571
07:15:32,580 --> 07:15:36,479
I'm just observing the game. Uh, it's fine though. I don't care

2572
07:16:44,240 --> 07:16:52,599
I gotta play very defensive

2573
07:16:52,599 --> 07:16:57,750
Everything is everything is just fine. Just another observation

2574
07:16:59,080 --> 07:17:00,759
I like his jacket

2575
07:17:00,759 --> 07:17:22,639
I like his jacket. It's a nice jacket. I need to get a good combo in here

2576
07:18:02,020 --> 07:18:30,680
Uh, i'm not even close to beating him. That's not a complaint. That's a fact time up time up

2577
07:18:30,759 --> 07:18:40,849
Is time up is time up do we count the devil trigger complaint?

2578
07:18:41,569 --> 07:18:51,759
Show it to me show it to me. I'll make the ultimate decision show it to me. Let me see. Give me a clip

2579
07:18:52,319 --> 07:19:15,669
I want to watch a clip

2580
07:19:16,549 --> 07:19:22,439
I think somebody just said chat. Fuck you. It was an observation

2581
07:19:24,479 --> 07:19:31,270
See, that's good. That's good. That's good. Okay

2582
07:19:31,590 --> 07:19:37,360
Okay

2583
07:19:37,360 --> 07:19:57,509
You tried to save it. No, did I anybody got a clip nightbot keeps deleting them gaining viewers

2584
07:19:59,189 --> 07:20:07,220
Nice you were complaining and then said it was an observation

2585
07:20:11,189 --> 07:20:23,759
I don't think anybody even has this. Okay, is this it? All right, let's see

2586
07:20:34,150 --> 07:20:38,520
All right, i'll put this on stream and we'll we'll go over it and we're gonna go over it

2587
07:20:38,840 --> 07:20:56,000
We're also gonna vote on it. I'll give you my two cents on it, but then we'll vote. Oh wait, that would be really biased

2588
07:20:56,080 --> 07:21:12,040
Yeah, never mind. We're not voting. I'll tell you should we have a mod council decide? All right, let's let's see

2589
07:21:36,049 --> 07:21:37,889
Hey virgil that was

2590
07:21:37,889 --> 07:21:43,330
Just an observation. That was a pretty very long demon form. I'm up just observing that

2591
07:21:43,490 --> 07:21:49,110
Yeah, no that I did. No the for real. That's a that is a literal complaint. That is actually a complaint

2592
07:21:49,430 --> 07:21:56,450
Yeah, i'm sorry. That is and do you want to know how you can tell i'm sorry everybody, but this is how you can tell

2593
07:21:57,090 --> 07:22:07,349
This part right here that part right there

2594
07:22:08,630 --> 07:22:15,380
Was me internally just talking shit about this game and then I finally just let it out

2595
07:22:21,639 --> 07:22:23,560
Hey virgil that was

2596
07:22:23,560 --> 07:22:28,919
Just an observation. That was a pretty very long demon form. I'm up just observing that

2597
07:22:29,080 --> 07:22:30,599
I don't care at all by the way

2598
07:22:30,599 --> 07:22:37,000
I I internally was was screaming about how long that was I was like that's fucking bullshit how long that demon form was

2599
07:22:39,619 --> 07:22:48,150
I think I think that counts, but you said you don't care. I'm fine with that

2600
07:22:55,349 --> 07:23:04,639
Okay, no, I think it counts you said hey virgil like hey paul

2601
07:23:12,849 --> 07:23:19,490
Let's do it again. How about this? How about this? Can I be can I be fucking quiet for five minutes?

2602
07:23:21,279 --> 07:23:22,799
Want to do it again

2603
07:23:22,799 --> 07:23:29,119
Can I be completely silent for five minutes while fighting and i'm not muting. I i'm gonna do this completely by the book

2604
07:23:29,840 --> 07:23:35,240
But i'm not i'm just gonna watch the youtube video somebody beating this guy

2605
07:23:50,639 --> 07:23:55,860
I'm gonna play super passively. I don't care about combos. I just care about winning

2606
07:23:56,580 --> 07:24:00,319
It doesn't really help me does it?

2607
07:24:00,319 --> 07:24:43,720
Okay, wait another complaint one. Okay, I can complain now though, right?

2608
07:24:44,439 --> 07:24:50,340
Oh you okay

2609
07:24:50,340 --> 07:24:59,619
He's got all of his health. Can somebody check real quick?

2610
07:25:00,799 --> 07:25:02,639
What is the playstation?

2611
07:25:02,639 --> 07:25:03,759
two

2612
07:25:03,759 --> 07:25:57,090
Trophy completion rate of this encounter. I feel like it's less than a hundred people. No, no, no, no

2613
07:25:57,330 --> 07:26:15,409
Okay, so when does it start? So we were we're oh, we're gonna come back. All right. What are we doing this time?

2614
07:26:19,169 --> 07:26:34,340
He is healing too

2615
07:26:34,340 --> 07:26:41,520
Yeah, that includes so no sound no noise at all. No laughing. No heavy breathing. No, no marge simpson sounds

2616
07:26:41,599 --> 07:27:01,169
No homer simpson sounds five minutes of complete silence and i'm not muting the microphone. I promise you he didn't even get him down at all

2617
07:27:01,250 --> 07:27:25,240
All right, so when i'm gonna start over here, okay use devil use dt until he does face cam

2618
07:27:25,319 --> 07:27:29,159
No, i'm not not not after like seven and a half hours eight hours streaming

2619
07:27:32,580 --> 07:27:37,889
uh, this guy is

2620
07:27:37,889 --> 07:27:41,090
I I never would even gotten this far in playstation 2

2621
07:27:41,909 --> 07:27:44,709
I would have gotten to the second or third mission of this game and been like

2622
07:27:46,069 --> 07:27:54,869
No, i'm done

2623
07:27:54,869 --> 07:27:57,430
No face cam no deal. I I don't have any clothes on

2624
07:28:01,860 --> 07:28:04,200
23 percent on ps3 and ps4

2625
07:28:08,720 --> 07:28:19,279
75 percent of us got to this part and went that was fun. Okay, are we ready?

2626
07:28:26,200 --> 07:28:29,279
I'm I have to be quiet

2627
07:28:29,279 --> 07:28:33,380
I'm not i'm how am I gonna mute the microphone? I have to touch it. All right, you ready?

2628
07:28:35,029 --> 07:28:42,259
Five minutes of complete and total silence the microphone. I'm gonna put it right here. You understand

2629
07:28:42,979 --> 07:28:47,349
Do you understand how close this is? You're gonna hear anything that comes out of my fucking mouth anything

2630
07:28:53,009 --> 07:28:55,009
I can breathe though. All right

2631
07:28:56,529 --> 07:29:03,560
Shit you're gonna hear me breathe that counts. Okay, so tell me does this count?

2632
07:29:08,580 --> 07:29:21,110
That's just me actually breathing. I think we'll be able to tell the difference. Okay, here we go

2633
07:29:23,970 --> 07:30:03,400
Start the timer now

2634
07:32:22,479 --> 07:32:26,580
So

2635
07:32:52,680 --> 07:32:58,119
I was trying so hard. I looked over at chat and somebody you fucker you asshole

2636
07:32:59,159 --> 07:33:01,000
somebody said

2637
07:33:01,000 --> 07:33:03,720
Bro, imagine stopping in the middle of a combo to shoot

2638
07:33:04,919 --> 07:33:06,919
fuck

2639
07:33:14,610 --> 07:33:19,970
Imagine stopping in the middle of a combo to shoot just like that person thinks i'm such a fucking dummy

2640
07:33:20,049 --> 07:33:21,250
You know what I mean?

2641
07:33:21,250 --> 07:33:23,680
Oh, that's so funny

2642
07:33:23,759 --> 07:33:25,759
Oh my god, i'm so sorry

2643
07:33:31,970 --> 07:33:33,970
You should have seen me pulsing

2644
07:33:34,369 --> 07:33:37,409
I was probably purple. I was trying so hard. It was like

2645
07:33:39,169 --> 07:33:46,549
And then it just came out I was fucking shit I had to have been shaking. Oh my god

2646
07:33:55,080 --> 07:33:56,840
This is so hard

2647
07:33:56,840 --> 07:34:03,279
I've been streaming for like eight hours too. I I might have to actually call it a night here

2648
07:34:10,150 --> 07:34:12,310
All right, i'm gonna i'm gonna give it one more try

2649
07:34:20,119 --> 07:34:23,000
Oh my god, that's so funny another bet

2650
07:34:31,540 --> 07:34:46,770
One more I was trying so hard to keep it in because I knew there was only like a minute left

2651
07:34:53,680 --> 07:35:00,319
Imagine stopping mid combo to shoot like oh i'm doing a good job. I got him. Let me attack him

2652
07:35:03,220 --> 07:35:05,220
This is so ridiculous

2653
07:35:08,229 --> 07:35:12,310
All right, i'm just gonna play let's go. It's it's time right now. No more predictions. No more betting

2654
07:35:12,950 --> 07:35:14,630
i'm doing it right now

2655
07:35:14,630 --> 07:35:38,470
dude

2656
07:35:38,470 --> 07:35:40,869
We're not even I can complain again. I can complain

2657
07:35:44,400 --> 07:35:50,720
There's nothing in video games that I hate more than enemies that run away or teleport away and you have to chase them

2658
07:35:51,360 --> 07:35:53,599
That's this whole entire video game

2659
07:35:54,080 --> 07:35:56,080
That's this entire video game

2660
07:35:56,159 --> 07:36:34,240
Trying to get the timing of the attack attack pause attack attack attack when you're when you're in a game scenario

2661
07:36:34,319 --> 07:37:07,119
That shit is so fucking hard to actually do how many controllers you think have been broken from this game?

2662
07:37:08,340 --> 07:37:12,080
Do you think it's more than 25 000? What do you think?

2663
07:37:13,409 --> 07:37:16,450
Do you think it's more than 30 000 controllers have been broken from this game?

2664
07:37:59,360 --> 07:38:07,220
I cannot beat this guy even millennia. I was like making progress. This guy just just destroys me every single time

2665
07:38:07,860 --> 07:38:37,520
I'm putting the bay wolf on yeah, fuck this. Give me the fuck out of there piece of shit

2666
07:38:39,139 --> 07:39:36,790
Let's try this

2667
07:39:37,970 --> 07:39:39,970
Oh

2668
07:39:44,450 --> 07:40:18,919
My god, dude, where is the opportunity to fucking attack this guy? What are the combos for this? I don't even know them

2669
07:40:54,130 --> 07:41:01,840
Pause why why why why why I don't like pausing. I like fucking going. I like person x I don't want to pause

2670
07:41:01,840 --> 07:41:37,169
Because

2671
07:41:37,250 --> 07:41:41,380
Dude, does he just parry every single fucking move he goes like

2672
07:41:43,080 --> 07:41:45,080
Why why how do I do that?

2673
07:41:57,799 --> 07:42:01,400
All right. I'm changing my stance. This is impossible. But with what i'm doing

2674
07:42:04,439 --> 07:42:25,250
This is impossible. I'm gonna try to parry him because how does the parry work?

2675
07:42:42,439 --> 07:42:44,759
Just press b when you're gonna get hit let me test it

2676
07:42:50,209 --> 07:43:07,009
Did it work am I doing it? I mean, it's a it's kind of a block

2677
07:43:10,529 --> 07:43:20,529
No, that's not gonna help me at all right now. I couldn't even do anything

2678
07:43:31,860 --> 07:43:45,080
I have to stick with trickster. I'll i'm gonna use the regular sword though. I did not

2679
07:43:47,479 --> 07:44:09,380
Uh, didn't I just change everything? Why is it back to these? All right, let's try again

2680
07:44:27,409 --> 07:44:55,240
Didn't want this equipped dude about that blt. I don't think i'm ever gonna beat this. I find this to be impossible

2681
07:44:55,560 --> 07:45:20,500
I don't think i'll ever do it. You beat millennia millennia was easier than this a hundred times easier

2682
07:45:35,400 --> 07:45:46,319
This has the heal from millennia and teleporting is worse also I you can summon a summons

2683
07:46:07,159 --> 07:46:09,159
This is fucking ridiculous

2684
07:46:09,639 --> 07:46:13,939
This is ridiculous

2685
07:46:13,939 --> 07:46:21,299
Stop backing off dude. He look what he does. Wow. I didn't back off. He did you should be yelling at his fucking chat

2686
07:46:21,860 --> 07:46:23,459
He's doing it. Not me

2687
07:46:23,459 --> 07:46:25,139
I i'm not look

2688
07:46:25,139 --> 07:46:28,919
I he's backing away

2689
07:47:08,770 --> 07:47:13,680
Oh my god, he just parries every single fucking move

2690
07:47:15,090 --> 07:47:19,169
There there is no exchange. He just walks and then teleports away and then does this

2691
07:47:35,040 --> 07:47:39,360
Look at how much slower my moves are i'm waving around a fucking toy. I'm like one

2692
07:47:40,000 --> 07:47:43,759
Two three four and he's already moved across the map by the time I do it

2693
07:48:29,270 --> 07:48:39,380
Get out of your fucking demon form, dude. I can't even hurt him. Yeah millennia didn't have a fucking form where she goes and no

2694
07:48:40,180 --> 07:48:47,380
Rot you can't hurt me at all. I've been invincible and I can heal off these i've been invincible for a full two minutes

2695
07:49:09,299 --> 07:49:10,500
Oh, wait

2696
07:49:10,500 --> 07:49:30,360
Oh, wait. Oh, wait. Oh, oh great. We both have the same idea

2697
07:49:50,659 --> 07:49:53,220
God just attacks bro. Come on, dude

2698
07:49:53,700 --> 07:49:58,659
Do you have any idea how un fucking bearable this encounter is you have you played it?

2699
07:49:59,750 --> 07:50:03,000
Have you played it? Did you play it if you didn't?

2700
07:50:03,650 --> 07:50:04,610
and

2701
07:50:04,610 --> 07:50:27,279
Silence if you did, you know what I just do. Oh, I can't even get him down to 50 before i'm just dead

2702
07:50:29,639 --> 07:50:32,200
I'm gonna do this three more times and then i'm turning the stream off

2703
07:50:33,080 --> 07:50:34,680
I'm getting out of here

2704
07:50:34,680 --> 07:50:37,650
I'm gonna free myself from this fucking madness

2705
07:50:38,369 --> 07:51:18,020
This is the first game I played when I was six years old. I am so sorry for six-year-old you

2706
07:51:18,979 --> 07:51:59,029
You probably had so many awful memories of this game. Look at my health

2707
07:52:10,439 --> 07:52:58,419
You have work. Nobody played this when they were six. They're full of shit. Don't listen to them. This may be fun

2708
07:52:59,380 --> 07:53:06,400
What the fuck was that where's my move that can do that dante get back to the fucking gym

2709
07:53:07,119 --> 07:53:09,119
Do a little lift a little more weights

2710
07:53:09,520 --> 07:53:15,400
He's almost back to full health again

2711
07:53:15,400 --> 07:53:17,669
He's he wait

2712
07:53:17,669 --> 07:53:19,669
He doesn't this is not millennia

2713
07:53:20,240 --> 07:53:26,099
He just heals when he's in demon form. What is this fucking dog shit?

2714
07:53:31,860 --> 07:53:34,819
He doesn't have to hit me

2715
07:53:34,819 --> 07:53:37,479
So do you yeah, i'm the video game protagonist

2716
07:53:38,099 --> 07:53:40,099
Nobody else gets those powers

2717
07:53:40,340 --> 07:53:53,139
Just I wish you just didn't counter every other swing like it just would be so much more

2718
07:53:53,540 --> 07:53:56,020
It would just be like you have to counter every move

2719
07:53:57,060 --> 07:53:59,299
Like dude, why can't I just attack him?

2720
07:54:17,590 --> 07:54:19,669
You have to damage burst him out of that

2721
07:54:21,110 --> 07:54:23,110
Good luck when he blocks

2722
07:54:23,409 --> 07:54:31,270
90 of every swing you do no matter what all right two more attempts and i'm fucking uninstalling the game

2723
07:55:11,080 --> 07:55:13,080
No stay out of that

2724
07:55:37,490 --> 07:55:39,569
Oh my god, dude, give me a fucking break

2725
07:56:22,580 --> 07:56:38,150
I don't have any heals. Didn't I buy one? I thought I had a large heal put it on easy

2726
07:56:40,959 --> 07:56:42,689
Wait

2727
07:56:42,689 --> 07:56:44,759
They're gone gone

2728
07:56:44,759 --> 07:56:53,729
If you use it, they're gone. They don't come back like when I restart that checkpoint. It's fucking five grand to buy one of those

2729
07:57:00,439 --> 07:57:02,439
Oh, that's awful

2730
07:57:05,319 --> 07:57:07,720
It's ten thousand now to buy a heal

2731
07:57:09,169 --> 07:57:11,169
Yeah, you have to restart the whole mission

2732
07:57:11,490 --> 07:57:13,169
Are you kidding me?

2733
07:57:13,169 --> 07:57:15,599
Oh that stinks

2734
07:57:15,599 --> 07:57:34,360
Okay, well

2735
07:57:34,360 --> 07:57:44,389
Restart the mission won't that put me through the first boss fight though. Wait optimize

2736
07:57:46,340 --> 07:57:48,959
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I see

2737
07:57:49,040 --> 07:57:51,040
Uh, so what the hell am I gonna do here?

2738
07:57:58,240 --> 07:58:02,639
All the gold orbs were used already. I didn't even know there was a final final final fight

2739
07:58:02,639 --> 07:58:05,680
I thought we were like working together and oh, yeah, we won together

2740
07:58:06,319 --> 07:58:13,139
Just go farm orbs. I might do that not tonight though

2741
07:58:41,959 --> 07:58:54,319
I wish I could not be stuck in that animation. It does so much damage. It's already over

2742
07:58:54,560 --> 07:59:41,200
It's a good place to get orbs. What's a good spot to do it 19 cancel out of the dive kick if you mission two

2743
07:59:50,279 --> 07:59:52,049
I just want to buy

2744
07:59:52,049 --> 07:59:54,369
Like another one of those gold orbs. I had two

2745
07:59:55,009 --> 08:00:27,990
I I just don't think it's possible without that without like three golden orbs and like eight heals

2746
08:00:28,389 --> 08:00:31,750
I'm going in there. I'm bringing a backpack full of shit into that fight when I go in there again

2747
08:00:32,069 --> 08:00:34,069
I'm gonna have 10 heals

2748
08:00:34,069 --> 08:00:39,169
And 30 revives I don't care if I die 15 times in a row

2749
08:00:39,810 --> 08:01:13,159
Never mind. I give up. Never mind. I just saw how many I collected it. That's gonna take like six hours

2750
08:01:16,659 --> 08:01:21,169
All right, that's it. I'm out of here. Uh, and i'm never playing this game ever again

2751
08:01:21,409 --> 08:01:24,630
I mean until i'm dead like this is not gonna happen ever again

2752
08:01:24,869 --> 08:01:32,529
Yeah, like they'll be they'll be like doing a funeral for me. They'll be like wait, but he never finished

2753
08:01:32,529 --> 08:01:38,200
He didn't beat virgil the priest is gonna go good. Fuck that whole game

2754
08:01:39,970 --> 08:01:45,490
Dearly beloved we are gathered here today to see our friend

2755
08:01:45,970 --> 08:02:56,959
We put to rest under the i'm getting weird with this one block every move andy

2756
08:03:52,340 --> 08:04:02,279
Damn it. You're just hailing you piece of shit

2757
08:04:33,540 --> 08:04:38,869
Even in demon form he blocks every move. How the fuck do you do this?

2758
08:04:39,830 --> 08:04:42,770
like honestly

2759
08:04:42,770 --> 08:04:44,770
This is fucking impossible

2760
08:04:54,900 --> 08:04:56,900
It took me two years

2761
08:04:58,080 --> 08:05:00,080
You should be jumping dude

2762
08:05:02,610 --> 08:05:08,610
Is this is this fucking dickhead on a top 10 list of most annoying boss fights in history? He has to be

2763
08:05:18,439 --> 08:05:36,159
Yeah, I get fucking exploited

2764
08:05:36,319 --> 08:06:48,319
What is this lock on fucking doing dude? Wait when the when you're locked on why can you swing in a different direction, dude?

2765
08:06:49,680 --> 08:06:51,680
It's so fucking annoying

2766
08:06:52,240 --> 08:07:16,680
it just like hurts just to attack him and

2767
08:07:17,700 --> 08:07:20,319
I don't know what the fuck's going on with this game

2768
08:07:20,319 --> 08:07:22,500
But like what the hell is going on here?

2769
08:07:23,650 --> 08:07:30,689
The game just literally turned like off and is down on my task bar four hours ago an explosion happened in my room

2770
08:07:33,750 --> 08:07:44,049
What is going on with this game?

2771
08:07:44,049 --> 08:07:59,349
I'm gonna lower the volume because i've no idea what's gonna happen here. Am I back? Oh my god

2772
08:08:22,959 --> 08:10:01,599
What's the point of a lock on if it just if you swing in a different direction shit, I can't no more teleporting

2773
08:10:01,759 --> 08:10:05,680
It's like the worst mechanic in every single video game

2774
08:10:09,909 --> 08:10:58,200
What the hell is this move?

2775
08:10:58,200 --> 08:11:32,020
Oh my god, what does that mean? Holy fucking shit, dude, dude

2776
08:11:32,340 --> 08:11:38,659
This weapon switching thing makes me want to fucking puke as well. What's he doing?

2777
08:11:41,380 --> 08:11:44,900
Where are my fucking heels? Oh my god this

2778
08:11:45,520 --> 08:11:48,340
2000 fucking 2 video game. I didn't

2779
08:11:49,200 --> 08:11:51,569
Restart the mission. Oh

2780
08:11:51,909 --> 08:11:53,909
My god, damn it, dude

2781
08:12:18,520 --> 08:12:24,840
I like just why like you've got to be fucking kidding me. That is infuriating

2782
08:12:49,459 --> 08:12:53,959
I literally had it. Yeah by doing the jump attack move

2783
08:12:55,990 --> 08:13:00,150
I'm so fucking pissed right now. I am so angry

2784
08:13:04,060 --> 08:13:08,380
Can I save it here so I don't have to do this shit over and over again if I want to restart the game?

2785
08:13:17,049 --> 08:13:24,009
Or do I have to restart every single time? Like what if I do this? Is that gonna do it?

2786
08:13:24,169 --> 08:14:14,139
Can I is that gonna work? No more teleport. God damn it

2787
08:15:30,099 --> 08:16:08,599
Oh great, I can't move. Where is he?

2788
08:17:50,810 --> 08:18:31,110
Okay, so I win. Game sucks. The sweat coming down my face right now. It's like all over my face

2789
08:18:31,430 --> 08:18:51,419
I look fucked up. If I turned on the webcam right now, I would scare you. Millennia is definitely harder

2790
08:18:53,080 --> 08:19:34,099
Yeah, that wasn't even that bad

2791
08:19:34,099 --> 08:20:02,889
Okay, I took a picture. I'll put it in the discord tomorrow. Yeah, no food quiz. Sorry

2792
08:20:03,209 --> 08:20:31,799
I had to beat Devil May Cry 3 and uh, I almost puked. Why is the volume so low now? I didn't turn it down

2793
08:20:34,729 --> 08:22:11,689
We should be fine for now. Oh wait, but they may though, right? We going again?

2794
08:22:15,909 --> 08:23:03,689
Oh, we are going again doing my victory lap. Oh, it's counting them. Oops. Well, that's fun

2795
08:23:05,139 --> 08:23:08,409
It was a a lot more intense than I thought it was gonna be

2796
08:23:10,580 --> 08:23:13,939
I didn't I knew Devil May Cry was a hard game, but I didn't know it was a really

2797
08:23:15,020 --> 08:23:18,819
Hard game. I would consider this to be really hard

2798
08:23:28,169 --> 08:23:39,400
DMC 3 is hard. DMC 4 and 5 are less so. Hmm. 3 is probably the hardest one

2799
08:23:40,900 --> 08:23:43,939
I remember 5 coming out and being interested in 5

2800
08:23:59,220 --> 08:24:07,669
You could probably beat DMC 2 with one hand. Really? Geez, you would really like 5

2801
08:24:10,470 --> 08:24:19,659
Well put it on the list

2802
08:24:19,659 --> 08:24:24,459
I would play at least the newer ones. I know the older ones can be a little weird, right?

2803
08:24:25,180 --> 08:24:28,619
The first one's like a completely different video game from what you guys said last night, right?

2804
08:24:45,909 --> 08:24:56,409
DMC 1 is very Resident Evil. 3 onward is fine

2805
08:24:57,669 --> 08:25:11,049
Hmm, you think 1 still holds up?

2806
08:25:11,770 --> 08:25:13,750
It probably does

2807
08:25:13,750 --> 08:25:16,709
But I would want to do the ones with a similar gameplay structure

2808
08:25:17,430 --> 08:25:24,939
Before I go back into the other ones

2809
08:25:24,939 --> 08:25:27,099
It absolutely does not. Oh, no

2810
08:25:27,979 --> 08:25:47,029
Can I get to 100? Well, if I wasn't RP walking around

2811
08:25:47,669 --> 08:26:00,950
Maybe I could have

2812
08:26:00,950 --> 08:26:05,540
Come on. Don't I get to 97? Ah, shit. Okay

2813
08:26:28,500 --> 08:26:32,389
Did you see how I beat that in two or three tries?

2814
08:26:33,029 --> 08:26:37,909
After I said I'm gonna uninstall the game. I said the same thing about Elden Ring, Millennium

2815
08:26:38,310 --> 08:26:58,220
That's how I know I have to beat it. That's the best way to do it

2816
08:26:59,020 --> 08:27:08,919
Okay

2817
08:27:17,779 --> 08:27:26,580
Okay

2818
08:27:26,580 --> 08:27:30,860
All right. I'll take an A for the first time

2819
08:27:31,779 --> 08:27:39,180
The entire playthrough at the last boss sounds good to me

2820
08:27:46,279 --> 08:28:03,049
Yeah, that that was about my report card. I'd say that's pretty close. I do hate being considered normal

2821
08:28:03,610 --> 08:28:05,450
So play it on hard

2822
08:28:05,450 --> 08:28:16,040
Okay, cool

2823
08:28:16,040 --> 08:28:18,790
All right. I'll see you guys later

2824
08:28:18,950 --> 08:28:31,369
Let's save it again just in case I want to open this up for any reason and I'll see you guys later

2825
08:28:32,779 --> 08:28:35,340
I'm glad I beat it. I'm glad I saw it to the end

2826
08:28:37,189 --> 08:28:42,729
Just had to threaten to uninstall it a few times to just to get myself seriously in that mode

2827
08:28:43,049 --> 08:28:50,520
I gotta pull that card out sometimes. Yeah, I'm glad I played it

2828
08:28:50,759 --> 08:28:54,389
I will probably play the other ones too at least maybe five

2829
08:28:54,630 --> 08:29:02,069
I would say five is probably would be next up before the next time you will see me live will be on the

2830
08:29:02,869 --> 08:29:11,110
Let's see, maybe saturday saturday, maybe sunday sunday the 21st

2831
08:29:15,319 --> 08:29:23,500
We'll see I might reverse the late saturday if that's possible plan on sunday, but there might be a reverse delay to

2832
08:29:24,060 --> 08:29:39,509
Start on saturday plan on sunday though. Thanks for watching. Thanks for putting up with my complaints

2833
08:29:40,069 --> 08:29:44,150
Mmm, I don't think this was not really a complaint stream not till like the last two hours

2834
08:29:45,639 --> 08:29:55,060
Hmm. No, I mean this was a kind of a complaint stream the last couple hours were I agree. They were observations. Yeah, that's fine

2835
08:29:59,299 --> 08:30:04,259
Also, I I have no idea what happened and I'll be lying if I

2836
08:30:04,840 --> 08:30:10,200
Was saying that didn't throw me off that like explosion shit from earlier that like really fucking threw me off big time

2837
08:30:11,159 --> 08:30:16,680
Uh, I don't know why that happened if it was a bug in the game. That's a really awful bug

2838
08:30:17,259 --> 08:30:21,419
I'm not gonna say that's what it was because I don't know. I have no idea why that happened

2839
08:30:23,459 --> 08:30:26,340
Who has any idea at this point?

2840
08:30:26,340 --> 08:30:29,779
I'm just sorry that that happened because I wish it didn't because that shit sucks

2841
08:30:30,240 --> 08:30:38,060
Especially when you're not prepared for it. So I don't think I mean

2842
08:30:38,619 --> 08:30:43,319
Look what I mean. We played I didn't change any settings. I didn't make any changes

2843
08:30:44,419 --> 08:30:51,400
After 15 hours in the game as the only time that happened. I don't I mean my obs is fine. My audio system's fine

2844
08:30:54,740 --> 08:30:57,459
I have no idea

2845
08:30:57,459 --> 08:31:04,439
I wonder if that really was an ultra rare bug that hung up the computer for a second and then

2846
08:31:04,759 --> 08:31:13,799
The audio just went crazy for those of you that thought that was really funny. I'm glad you did

2847
08:31:15,020 --> 08:31:19,930
But for those of you that didn't think that was funny. Yeah, i'm sorry. I I

2848
