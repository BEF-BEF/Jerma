1
00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:11,320
Bada! Hey guys, you can probably tell by the title. Labo VR.

2
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:37,030
Change the title? What do you mean? Cardboard VR? What's wrong with that?

3
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:52,939
Is Cardboard VR not a good title? No, not really. It's not. Why? Does it have to be funny?

4
00:00:54,380 --> 00:01:11,750
Set your expectations real low, guys. This is a Labo stream. It's too funny. I don't know. How

5
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:24,980
about, like, how else would you describe what we're doing? This is Labo VR. It's Cardboard VR.

6
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:43,659
I'm to the point. Every time Jerma says Labo, drink. Labo, Labo, Labo, Labo, Labo, Labo, Labo,

7
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:58,439
Labo, Labo, Labo, Labo, Labo, Labo. Hope it's water. But there's nothing wrong with the title.

8
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:13,699
All right, we're keeping it. It's staying the way it is. Anyways, so we've got to talk about

9
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,580
Labo VR in particular, but I've got to, first of all, this is a special occasion.

10
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:27,340
We only do Labo VR. Well, we never do Labo VR. We've never done Labo VR. We only do Labo once.

11
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:40,729
Labo! Hey! We only do Labo, like, once a year. Three times a year. So I've got the finest

12
00:02:40,729 --> 00:02:45,270
fucking grocery store wine you could possibly find. That actually looks kind of good.

13
00:02:46,969 --> 00:02:50,949
Let's, I, I couldn't really, this is hard to get this open. So let's go ahead,

14
00:02:51,669 --> 00:02:56,620
diaper bulge. Get out of here. We're going to do a little bit of a, I'm going to pop it,

15
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:08,460
and we're going to say, start the Labo! You ready? Start the Labo! That was the same audio

16
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:19,939
clip. Anyways, where's my glass? Right there. Let's see. This is, this is not going to be

17
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:24,340
good. No, I can't say shit like that. If I say shit like that, then I'm like, I don't

18
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:38,620
want to slander a company. It's probably good. Okay. Glass, hint of old Thai dishwasher soap,

19
00:03:40,969 --> 00:03:47,639
hard water, and sediment. Oh, that sounds good. Okay, but I probably shouldn't do this

20
00:03:47,639 --> 00:04:01,030
over the Labo. Where should I do this? This is dangerous. Did you hear that? It made the

21
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:11,449
pouring sound and nothing even came out. Listen to this. I can't even show you. Do you hear

22
00:04:11,449 --> 00:04:26,819
that? Let it aerate. That's too, don't do a heavy pour. There you go. This is called

23
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:33,939
a copper thief. This was selected by the seller master select. It's probably going to be good.

24
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,839
All right, let me just move my diaper out of the way. I had to wear a diaper for this

25
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:42,439
stream just because I could just shit and piss in here. It's going to be a while.

26
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:48,439
You're also probably noticing, excuse me, Jeremy, what's going on with these? Are these

27
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:54,199
new? What is this? This doesn't look like yours. Well, I think my switch might be permanently dead.

28
00:04:54,839 --> 00:05:06,339
This is italics's switch. So I didn't, I haven't turned on the switch in a long time.

29
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:12,439
It's been like at least like two or three months, three months. It hasn't even been

30
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:20,899
plugged in. It won't turn on. I think the lithium battery in it is permanently dead.

31
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:27,899
This wasn't $60 by the way. I'm moving this like over here. So now you fucking sickos can like

32
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:36,250
talk shit about my life. How did you break it? I didn't break it. It just, it won't turn on.

33
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:40,970
I can't, it won't charge. I can't even get it to the screen like the, hey, it's charging

34
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:52,709
screen to pop up. Whatever. Let's try this. What is in here? There's like pieces of wood in

35
00:05:52,709 --> 00:06:06,620
here. Did I fuck this up already? That's sweet. There's some sweetness here. It looks

36
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:12,629
like a Jolly Rancher. What's this one called? This is a, okay, this is a bourbon red wine.

37
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:18,459
Bourbon red wine. Does that mean this is extra? All right, I gotta be careful. I need a,

38
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:22,810
whatever. This is a fuck you table. Who cares? Welcome to, this is Nintendo Labo if you don't

39
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:27,769
know. We're going to do the VR kit. The weird thing about the VR kit is the VR kit

40
00:06:27,769 --> 00:06:37,000
for some reason decided to release in like three different packages. So this is the

41
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:46,250
Blaster and the headset. They sold out of the regular one. So I had to, I went around

42
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:52,579
looking all over the place for where I could get the other kits. This thing right here,

43
00:06:53,060 --> 00:07:00,009
this like big camera elephant trunk, this shit's going to take about four hours to

44
00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:10,360
build. This is the longest build in Labo history. This is going to take a long time.

45
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:14,279
So I'm actually kind of glad I only have the two here because it's going to be like a six

46
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:20,680
hour build just for these two. Plus I've already wasted like 12 minutes. So, you know,

47
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:26,279
that's what I do. I'll be ready for a long stream. And by the way, only drink alcohol

48
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:32,839
responsibly and only if it's legal in your city. You know, drink responsibly. Only

49
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:36,360
drink when you're going to build a Labo in the comfort of your home with wine. Don't do

50
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:45,350
it ever, ever again. All right, let's go. Let me get it on the screen. There it is.

51
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:50,069
You probably remember this setup here. It's going to take a week. No, it's not going to

52
00:07:50,069 --> 00:08:02,490
take a week. What else we got? Get that out of here. It looks like I have a wicked

53
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:09,829
fat stomach. Do I? No, this ain't moving from here. This is like staying right fucking

54
00:08:09,829 --> 00:08:15,209
here. I'm not taking this anywhere else. All right, so let's go. We're going to build

55
00:08:15,209 --> 00:08:23,319
the headset first. We should have that good to go. I am ready. We're going to make the,

56
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:28,870
I think we're going to make the goggles first. No, I don't, do we have to practice?

57
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:41,909
I already know how to do this. Is this, okay, what a waste of paper. They put this in every

58
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:48,870
single Labo. It's this one right here. This is like the little french fry cup holder thing.

59
00:08:50,809 --> 00:08:54,330
I don't need this right now. Move that out of the way. Actually, I don't need this whole

60
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:58,730
thing. Let's, okay, let's, let's go ahead and just do it. I know how to do this shit.

61
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:05,480
That's not my first ever time. All right, yeah, there it is. I, just to give you a rundown how

62
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:12,360
this works, you get a cardboard cut out here and you flip it over and it's grooves. And what

63
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,529
you do is you fold the grooves and you turn it into a little device. Put the wine on the

64
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:22,409
desk. It's going to be fine because I'm, this whole thing is going on the ground. I'm putting

65
00:09:22,409 --> 00:09:25,850
on fucking pants. I'm going to go get like just jogging pants and put them on.

66
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:31,659
There's no way this strange happening like this. All right, that looks good over there.

67
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:42,419
You guys got me so fucking self-conscious every day. I can't wear, like I cannot wear these

68
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:51,190
pants. You guys are all immature. Grow up a little bit. All right, here we go. All right,

69
00:09:51,190 --> 00:10:03,049
so we got this piece here. I can't even like see. Like this, I already know how to do,

70
00:10:03,049 --> 00:10:08,870
I got to get a trash bag in here. It's going to be a long night. I already know how to do

71
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:18,340
this. I've done it like six times already. Don't grow up too much or you'll wind up like

72
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:24,139
Jerma985. Yeah, don't grow up too much. I can't wait to, I got a plan, by the way,

73
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:27,019
to how to get you, that's right, you sitting there right now. You're going to get to see

74
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:31,820
Nintendo Labo for yourself. Oh my god, it almost just happened within five minutes.

75
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:45,370
Okay, I'll listen to that guy. So it folds like this and then like that. Tab goes in here,

76
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:53,350
as you can see. Got the Nintendo Labo side. By the way, just want to make this real clear,

77
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:58,620
I am the only motherfucker on this whole website. On the whole website, and it slides in like that,

78
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,139
as you can see. I'm pretty much being nervous. I'm the only fucking person on the whole website

79
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:06,139
that does this. You're not going to find this anywhere else. You will never find somebody,

80
00:11:06,139 --> 00:11:10,940
dude, what you see here building a Labo on the whole website. Find me another streamer.

81
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:19,500
Hasn't never happened. I'm the Labo guy. That's like the Jerma the Labo guy 985.

82
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:24,490
I can't wait till the Nintendo invites me to like the next Labo premiere event,

83
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:28,740
because I'm the only fucking person that's made any content of this goddamn game.

84
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:36,980
Oh, we're here at the Nintendo Labo event here with the exclusive streamers and YouTubers

85
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:40,659
that are really, really into the game and series. Look who's coming down the aisle.

86
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:45,460
Who's coming out of the limo? Oh, it's just Jerma985. He's the only fucking person.

87
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:54,409
I should just get on stage and do a fucking speech. He's coming down the aisle. That's a grocery

88
00:11:54,409 --> 00:12:00,629
store. That's what the event is. It's not even like a cool theater. We're like the mayonnaise aisle.

89
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:12,649
All right, here we go. Don't swear. Stop swearing. I know I can rotate the camera

90
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:21,990
around with a little tool here. I never thought this was ever going to happen.

91
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:32,860
But this is actual, this is actual stomach sitting on table. That's not like clothes.

92
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:38,649
I don't, this is why I don't fucking ever turn on a camera. All right, I know what I'm doing.

93
00:12:38,649 --> 00:12:53,769
Let's go. You tilt. You can zoom in by holding. Yeah, you go like this. I've got the boomer belly.

94
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:01,830
Reset the camera by pressing X. I've got a little toy. Can you see how good,

95
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:06,870
is it showing up well? Because this stream's about to go off the fucking rails. So

96
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:12,200
just wait till you get to play VR though. We're going to share it.

97
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:15,639
That, this camera right here is going in the headset. I was going to do two,

98
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:19,159
but it was impossible. There's no way it was going to fit in there.

99
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,460
Can you turn the music up a little louder? You want the music louder? The music sucks.

100
00:13:24,259 --> 00:13:27,220
No, it doesn't. All right, that's, I already did this. Let's just skip it.

101
00:13:28,179 --> 00:13:31,990
But these are cool. These are really cool. It takes a while to build.

102
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:42,200
You can get your friends over, grab a bottle of wine and do it. Do it. I just thought

103
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,960
about something right there. I'm going to go get into that. But we'll do that on the first

104
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,960
wine break. Just thought about it. You can just see the cogs turning in my brain.

105
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:59,429
They were just spinning. Box wine. This is actually bottle wine tonight, not box wine.

106
00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:05,129
Write it down. I won't, no, I will not forget. Don't worry. Okay. Onto the real thing. Let's

107
00:14:05,129 --> 00:14:20,710
build the headset. Oh, switch it. We're good. All right. So we're going to do the

108
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:48,840
pedal. What do you mean pedal? What? No, no, no, no, no, this is wrong. Hold on. I'll fix

109
00:14:48,840 --> 00:15:14,730
this. Always keep a backup switch. Uh, yeah, it was in the other switch. That's right. This

110
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:21,820
like rich and I have to do the whole thing again. God damn it. They looked at how,

111
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:26,059
look, give me a break. You see how easy this is to fucking fuck this up. They're,

112
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:38,090
they're like this big. They're this big. Hold on. You can't read a microscope to read

113
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:52,070
the text on here. I'm not building that thing again. I already did it.

114
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,779
For a second, I thought they put it the wrong thing in the box. I was like, this is

115
00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:05,960
no fucking way that somebody would do that. Right? There's no way. All right. Okay.

116
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:28,070
Everybody can relax. I'm ready. Okay. Your controllers have to be updated. All right.

117
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:34,740
Let's go. Should I not hold it? Is it like radiation coming in here? That like kind of

118
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:43,450
freaks me out sometimes. Is it like electromagnetic fields like going, I feel like it's going to

119
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:47,929
interfere if I pick it up. You're going to get super powers if you just hold on to it.

120
00:16:47,929 --> 00:17:01,370
Well, we'll start drinking. Oh, oh, oh, I can't fucking do that. These are not mine.

121
00:17:01,929 --> 00:17:11,369
I just saw haha. You got like, you got like a hundred more of those to do it tonight.

122
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:20,420
Just going to tell you this is a fucking Nintendo labo stream. I guarantee you if

123
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:23,220
you've somebody keeps track of that, there'll be at least fucking each each one of you

124
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:30,789
will do that like fucking 30 times. Lick it. Why would this is not mine? I don't

125
00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:38,180
lick things that are not mine. You're using up the supply that you get the idea.

126
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:52,940
You can tell me like cringy. I fucking dare you. What do you have? I would love to have

127
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:56,940
that one, Nintendo, but you only made like a certain amount of them and you can't buy

128
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:02,599
them anywhere. They were so scared that people didn't want to spend $80 on the whole

129
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:07,700
thing that they made half of those and half of these. I don't have this one. I have this

130
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:21,289
one. Lick the cartridge. It's not a rat tail. It's my hair coming down. Look,

131
00:18:23,259 --> 00:18:29,319
restrict the use of VR mode for children six and under. VR mode is only suitable for

132
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:34,299
players age seven and above. Kids, please check with an adult. Do you want to allow

133
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:47,059
the use of VR mode? Six and under. All right, you're two. You can adjust your

134
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:51,700
VR mode settings here at any time. I don't have it yet. I need to make the VR headset.

135
00:18:53,109 --> 00:19:05,670
No, I already did it. Isn't there a skip? Welcome to Nintendo Labo. Here, we're going

136
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:11,849
to show you how to make the fucking pencil holder. All right, I already did it. Just

137
00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:20,759
skip. Wait, wait, what was that? What's that? What's that thing? What's the guy?

138
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:33,480
There's more? Oh shit, they never used A before completely. I know. I can't play

139
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:38,970
completely. Do this again. Put them wrong. Didn't lick the cartridge. I'm not going to

140
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:45,130
lick that cartridge. Guys, this thing said it was going to take like five hours to build it,

141
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:51,049
and it's been 20 fucking minutes and I've done the wrong cartridge. I'm going to be here all

142
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:59,339
night. Lick the cartridge. Why would you ever, what world would you want to live on to do that

143
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:08,500
about licking the cartridge? You, okay, you're doing this wrong. I really hate to

144
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,900
blow this up here, but I've had like three sips of wine and you're already asking me to

145
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:18,900
do weird fucked up shit. I know now that like future drunk Jeremy is not going to do that.

146
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,859
You've ruined it. You could have done that like in two hours and I would have done it.

147
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:37,500
Now I know. I mean, that's your fault, not mine. He's not going to do it. I already know.

148
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:44,059
I can hear. My internal monologue right now is locked in that I'm not going to lick that

149
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:47,900
cartridge. It's locked in and then nothing that can be done is not going to change. It's

150
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:56,599
not going to happen. It's already locked in. I can't believe I can't do all the other ones.

151
00:20:56,599 --> 00:21:01,240
All right. This is going to take 30 to 60 minutes in Jeremy stream times. That's like two hours.

152
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:07,450
It's not going to take 30 minutes. We're going to make the actual goggles that go on your face.

153
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:21,140
Wait, is it actual glass? You actually put like a piece of glass in there.

154
00:21:25,299 --> 00:21:32,490
Making the Toy-Con VR goggles. Four steps you need to complete. This is really actually

155
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:41,690
cool. VR lenses, VR goggles, the safety cap and then prepare to play. We don't need this anymore.

156
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:48,230
It's getting recycled. Don't worry. Everyone's like, oh, you can break it. It's getting

157
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:54,440
recycled. Don't worry. All right. So we need the VR lenses. Dip it in the wine. No, thanks.

158
00:21:55,079 --> 00:22:02,789
The VR lenses are inside this box, but hold on a second. Don't go opening this box yet.

159
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:22,950
There are some warnings first. There's a snake in here. That's the warning. Oh,

160
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:36,329
Nintendo. You got me. Wait, what is the warning? Warning. Never use the VR lenses to look at the

161
00:22:36,329 --> 00:22:48,390
sun or any other bright lights. You could damage your eyes. Should I try it? It's pretty

162
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:51,750
bright out right there. No, I'm not damaging my eyes for the sake of fucking comedy. No way.

163
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,480
Never place the VR lenses in direct sunlight or near a light source. Concentrated light can

164
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:08,970
burn nearby objects. What are they talking about? If these lenses are facing a certain

165
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:16,809
way, I can burn my house down? All right. What about warning three? No. All right. So let

166
00:23:16,809 --> 00:23:26,460
me see. These are dangerous apparently. Don't look directly at the sun. All right. Look at

167
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,339
this. You got, I don't know. I know we're not doing this yet, but just look at this.

168
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:37,480
Look at this image on the left here. That looks like a superpower. That like looks cool

169
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,839
enough to, you know what I mean? That looks like somebody's shooting fire out of their eyes.

170
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:53,220
Is that really possible? All right. Well, there they are. Is that the only thing that's in

171
00:23:53,220 --> 00:24:02,630
there? There's something else in here. I have to test it. Maybe. Maybe, but no, it's, it's,

172
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:06,630
the sun's gone. This, it's, it's not that, no, I don't have, I don't have a direct sunlight here.

173
00:24:07,589 --> 00:24:12,700
Try to like do it like over here and like beam over here. It's too bad it's not like

174
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:19,450
noon. I don't think this is not for anything. All right. So what do we need? We need a sheet

175
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:27,240
A. I'm going to move this out of the way now. There's nothing else in the box. I'm

176
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,680
going to put it back in here though just to keep it safe because it's dangerous.

177
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:44,009
I remember the sun. No, I mean the sun's not at its peak right now. It is currently, it's 4 30,

178
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:52,250
4 30 p.m. Pacific daylight time. So it means the sun is no longer, it's going down. The sun

179
00:24:52,250 --> 00:25:01,609
doesn't hit this side anyways. All right. Here's A. A. No, not that one. It's another, it's,

180
00:25:01,609 --> 00:25:07,019
it's A2. So it's this one. All right. I'm going to move this shit out of the way.

181
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:20,940
Get the blind out of here before I cause a fucking huge problem. Lick the cardboard. You guys,

182
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:29,369
I ain't doing any of that shit. So here is the main piece here. So we're going to move

183
00:25:29,369 --> 00:25:38,660
this big piece here. This big one, the yellow one. Punch it out. I know you guys, I know

184
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:45,160
you guys missed those satisfying noises like this one. I know you guys missed those satisfying

185
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:53,380
noises. All right. It's a great big yellow one and then I'm assuming we're just going to

186
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:59,140
punch it around other pieces of the sheet later. Okay. Don't forget, if you have any trouble,

187
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:03,750
you can use the back button. Yep. All right. These goggles will be your window into a whole

188
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:07,990
new world. They're pretty important. So let's make sure to make them right. Don't screw it

189
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:12,549
up. Be careful not to mix up the front and the back. Pay attention to the screen so that

190
00:26:12,549 --> 00:26:19,990
you always have the correct side up like that. That's correct. No mistakes allowed. I don't

191
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:23,190
make mistakes when I play this. Make sure you have plenty of space when working on big

192
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:28,819
pieces. It might help to put away any pieces you don't need for now. Yeah, I'm good.

193
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:37,990
I got this. I got this completely. All right. Flip it over. Before we start folding,

194
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:42,309
take a good look at where the fold lines are. Right. Okay. They're all over the place here.

195
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:49,369
Yeah. When making fold lines, try to crease the whole length firmly with both hands. I know.

196
00:26:50,329 --> 00:26:56,380
This is our first fold. Okay. Both hands. Crease it right here. Ready? First fold of the

197
00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:09,190
evening. Hey, I want to, nevermind. That's good. That's creased. I didn't even do the

198
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:12,069
right one. I didn't even do the right one. Not paying attention. It's this one.

199
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:20,259
Already did it wrong. You already did the wrong fold. Don't make any mistakes, kids.

200
00:27:21,579 --> 00:27:32,410
Just make a mistake on the first fold. Looks good. Good job. Yeah. That's nice and creased.

201
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:39,940
Now for the two sides. Both these come up. I think all of them. I'm just going to do

202
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:48,900
them all this way. I'm going to punch out this shit too. All right. Nice and tight.

203
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:55,660
I got to fucking don't do that. I'm going to make, every time I start to make a room of mess,

204
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:59,420
it just stays a mess forever. And I always talk about how I'm going to clean it and I never,

205
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:06,140
ever do. Ever. What do you mean ruin it? What did I do? What are you talking about?

206
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:12,940
I had to punch the holes out. What do you mean ruin it? The long use ball. Okay. That

207
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:20,170
one and then the, yeah, right here. I didn't, how did I fuck it up? What are you talking

208
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:38,339
about? How is it fucked up? I didn't do anything wrong. These both fold in and then the tabs go.

209
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:45,299
And then I believe this is going to, ooh, this is where it gets tricky. Oh, ruined. Oh,

210
00:28:45,299 --> 00:29:00,460
it's ruining it. Looks good. This looks good too. This fucking shiatsu. So that, then these tabs

211
00:29:01,099 --> 00:29:11,829
go down like that. Push that out. Destroying it. You guys have never built a fucking labo

212
00:29:11,829 --> 00:29:19,500
before. You have no idea. How many of you have built a labo before? Show of hands. None of you.

213
00:29:21,529 --> 00:29:29,769
You know how they say, oh man, yeah, I, streamer, influencer. Yeah, I played labo and I,

214
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:32,890
I mean, like a lot of people really thought it was cool and they bought it. Like a bunch of

215
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:39,130
you guys bought it. I don't think any of you bought it. I've done this like fucking five

216
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:45,190
times. You probably, maybe three of you have bought one. Like it doesn't do anything.

217
00:29:51,529 --> 00:29:57,700
Paid off. Wait, did I not do this one? These tabs fold, right? Am I doing the folds wrong? I

218
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:03,079
better not be. Did I ever broke it? It's over. All right. If one piece breaks, I quit.

219
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:20,200
These come up. Those ones fold over. Now we have to get the glass in here. Okay.

220
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:25,079
So then that comes over here. Get that out of direct sunlight. Don't touch that.

221
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:33,609
Here we go again. I need to know. I need to know. I'm going to look at a light

222
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:46,980
just quickly. Are you in there, lenses? Come on out. Sup. Hi there. We're the VR lenses. Good to

223
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:53,819
meet you. Sorry for all the warnings. Please don't peel off the film on the lenses.

224
00:30:55,140 --> 00:31:03,450
Sorry for all the warnings. You are real. Try to avoid touching the round lenses themselves.

225
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:14,569
They need to be nice and clean. I think I already touched them a bunch. Okay. Behold

226
00:31:14,569 --> 00:31:19,430
the VR lenses. Time to attach these guys to the big piece we creased before.

227
00:31:20,309 --> 00:31:41,849
All right. Hold on. Where did they go? So don't, but don't take this off. All right. So don't

228
00:31:41,849 --> 00:31:51,829
peel that off. So this is going over here. Bring it over to the side with the tabs we let standing

229
00:31:51,829 --> 00:32:10,890
up and slot it in from below. What? Like this? Okay. So those tabs are up, right? I did that,

230
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:21,109
right? I'm not touching the lenses. I have not touched the lenses one time. Now let's make

231
00:32:21,109 --> 00:32:35,700
a quick check. Does everything look the same on the screen? Yeah. Yeah. It does. I'm gonna

232
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:39,859
have to lick those lenses clean. Remove. Oh God. Remove these two pieces from sheet B.

233
00:32:39,859 --> 00:33:00,259
Already going to B. Which ones? The two canisters? Lick them. You guys are fucked.

234
00:33:00,259 --> 00:33:03,859
All right. Take out the middle. Let's punch them in your view so you can see how cool

235
00:33:03,859 --> 00:33:19,269
it looks. All right. Good. So these are both, these are identical. So then these go on

236
00:33:19,269 --> 00:33:28,390
sides like this. Hey, we want action too. Use these on the round holes as guides

237
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:40,839
here to line everything up perfectly. The black side should be facing up like this. Okay.

238
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:48,619
The stream's over. Oh, because I ripped a little bit. It doesn't matter. You're not

239
00:33:48,619 --> 00:33:52,700
going to fucking see this. It's going to be on my head. I'm going to let they fold.

240
00:33:53,660 --> 00:34:00,740
Oh fuck. Get out the bag with the special parts. Are we going to rubber band this? No.

241
00:34:01,619 --> 00:34:07,430
Here's the special bag. Don't look. Don't look this directly in the sun.

242
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:10,550
Do not put this up to your eye. It'll fucking burn your house down. Don't do it.

243
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:29,019
All right. Two of the gray washers. There's a lot of gray washes in here. Just two of them.

244
00:34:29,579 --> 00:34:47,699
There's a bag within a bag. Only Nintendo. And Lego. And every other company that makes

245
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:55,099
the small, loseable parts. Okay. Two washers. Got them. Now what? I gotta put the seat

246
00:34:55,099 --> 00:35:04,710
down. This is killing me. I'm already sweating. It's fucking hot. I'm going to go like turn the AC

247
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:16,860
on. All right. Two of the gray washers. Punch it through here. Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.

248
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:20,380
One after the slip the holes in the pieces of the sticky Audi bits. Wait.

249
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:27,429
Slip the holes in the pieces over the sticky Audi bits on the sides of the VR lenses.

250
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:46,949
Like this. Okay. And then a washer over it. This is where the washer come in. Here goes

251
00:35:46,949 --> 00:35:56,739
nothing. The washer should snap on like this. Like that. I'm not touching the lens. Don't worry.

252
00:35:56,739 --> 00:36:16,250
Don't freak out. I'm not touching the lens. God damn it. Get on there. All right. I did

253
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:32,280
touch the lens this time. I'm touching all over the lens. I swear to God. I can't.

254
00:36:33,699 --> 00:36:41,380
Oh no. Oh my God. Why is this so fucking hard to do? That's the right side.

255
00:36:41,380 --> 00:37:15,769
You don't understand. It's not working. Oh, they really went down in quality, didn't they?

256
00:37:15,769 --> 00:37:29,510
Says the vehicle. I don't understand. Guys, it's supposed to just snap on. It's supposed to snap

257
00:37:29,510 --> 00:38:01,610
on. It's not on. It's not on. I'm not too weak. It's just, it's not cut. I got it. It's

258
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:06,420
not cut right. It's not cut right. I got a defect. You want me to prove that? Look at that.

259
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:10,739
You want to prove my defect? Look at, look at, look at the defect that I have.

260
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:30,039
I am defective, as you can see. It's warped. Same thing on the other side. Great. Go back.

261
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:38,440
I did it. No, I didn't do it wrong any time. No, that's correct. Same thing on the other side.

262
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:48,579
And that snaps in. So he's going to lock it in. See if it's as difficult to do this one.

263
00:38:48,579 --> 00:38:56,309
This one doesn't look warped. Done. In one, in one second. This one not warped.

264
00:38:56,309 --> 00:39:04,489
Let's make sure it's on there. Good. Not even warped. All right, so that's in there now. That's

265
00:39:04,489 --> 00:39:13,300
done. I've got like sediment on my face. What are we doing down here? All right. Looks good.

266
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:18,969
We're going to fold it over. The VR lenses are fully attached. This piece is taking up a lot

267
00:39:18,969 --> 00:39:34,280
of space. Let's fold it up a bit to be more compact. So this comes up. So we go like that

268
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:47,340
and then like this. And that comes down here like that. Okay, we're making a McDonald's

269
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:52,659
Happy Meal. Tuck the cardboard underneath the plastic right here. You'll need to do

270
00:39:52,659 --> 00:40:05,960
this again later, so remember it well. Like that. Okay, it's in. And with that,

271
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:14,389
the VR lenses are ready. They are? Phew, that was quite the complex piece to start with,

272
00:40:14,389 --> 00:40:19,739
but we're not done yet. Maybe we ought to take a quick break. You got it. So how does this go?

273
00:40:19,739 --> 00:40:43,900
Like this? All right, so that's that. Let's go two out of four. Windrate. Yeah, I gotta windrate

274
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:48,679
real quick. All right, so if I can move this out of the way. Let's get this in a spot

275
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:55,750
where I know where it is. Right over here. I was gonna throw that, but that would be

276
00:40:55,750 --> 00:41:02,900
better to do. All right, so let's get B, sheet B again. And we do the big piece.

277
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:22,809
Whole thing. Can you get into my car? I don't know what that means. All right,

278
00:41:22,809 --> 00:41:31,769
is this the only one we need? Just B. This is gonna be a pretty complex shape,

279
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:41,940
apparently. So I gotta punch out a lot of this crap. Hold on. So this is nothing. This is

280
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:55,269
just a big three. Three. And then the middle stays in. Now this stays in. This pops out.

281
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:04,840
He said ear. Oh, sorry. My eyes aren't that good. It's hard for me to see all the way over

282
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:22,170
there. Here comes the counting joke. We all think it's so funny to count. One, two, three,

283
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:28,170
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. It's my favorite. I love it.

284
00:42:28,809 --> 00:42:37,099
So we've got this is good. Everything's done. Okay, this will form the slot into

285
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:42,789
which we insert the console itself. Lay it out printed side up and look at these fold lines

286
00:42:42,789 --> 00:42:53,190
in the middle. I see them. So this goes across this. Is this is this foldable? This

287
00:42:53,190 --> 00:43:17,590
doesn't look like it folds. I guess it does. Okay, then is volume too low? Yeah,

288
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:24,340
that's better, right? Is that like a little better? No, not really. It's fine. I'll turn

289
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:29,139
it down later. Don't worry. I'll panic go back and forth, lowering and increasing the volume over

290
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:34,739
the next four hours. All right, then this one comes up this way. This is a tricky one.

291
00:43:35,539 --> 00:43:48,070
This is tricky, guys. All right, so that's done. And that's done. So we got these two

292
00:43:48,070 --> 00:44:10,329
folded up. We should do these flaps at the ends too. Both flaps? Yeah. You're in the

293
00:44:10,329 --> 00:44:15,639
midst of dealing with finals. Well, good luck. Hopefully you ace them. Hopefully you get

294
00:44:15,639 --> 00:44:27,619
at least a B minus. These come up? Yeah, the whole thing does. My eyes are getting so bad.

295
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:41,429
Hope these tabs go up. Of course they do. Two? That should be it. Now we're going to use the

296
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:52,940
sponge stickers from the bag. Sponge stickers? Ah, this thing here. I dropped something.

297
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:57,500
That's the core. Fuck, there's wine on it. Oh, I can't like get over there. Hold on.

298
00:44:58,219 --> 00:45:08,199
There's no way to get this reliably without causing a problem. There's three different

299
00:45:08,199 --> 00:45:14,119
problems here. There's like my ass in this camera. There's like fall over table.

300
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:48,409
Okay. Why do you wear short shorts? These are not short shorts. They're regular shorts.

301
00:45:48,409 --> 00:45:57,059
I'm just sitting down like a normal human. They're just shorts and I'm sitting. Sorry,

302
00:45:57,059 --> 00:46:02,650
I don't have like shorts that go down to my ankles. A bunch of fucking prankers

303
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:15,179
pranking me all the time. All right, that is what I need. So then I get to tear these off.

304
00:46:15,179 --> 00:46:18,380
These stickers are going to stop the console from slipping around. It doesn't matter if they're

305
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:27,269
a little wonky. Put all these on here. There are eight spots to place the stickers and they're

306
00:46:27,269 --> 00:46:31,909
very, they're helpfully numbered. Pay close attention to the markers as we place them.

307
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:37,269
So just put smoothing the piece out to make sure it's nice and flat will help the

308
00:46:37,269 --> 00:46:40,309
stickers sit properly. Right? Well, you just made me fold the whole fucking thing. So

309
00:46:41,269 --> 00:46:50,739
that's not going to happen. First up are the smaller stickers. There's smaller ones.

310
00:46:51,860 --> 00:47:00,539
Start with the spot. Oh, I can't see. So I have to tear this off. Do what? Is it tear

311
00:47:00,539 --> 00:47:09,610
off nice and clean? It does. Okay. All right. So we just align these up. So it goes like

312
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:20,860
that, like this. Oh, I'm going to fuck this whole thing up. So it goes like halfway on.

313
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:24,460
All right. Here we go. Can't screw it up. I only got one. There are no extras in here.

314
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:50,739
It's like this. Right? Right? Yeah. That looks good. Yeah. Now that's, that's perfectly fine.

315
00:47:52,179 --> 00:47:58,420
That's perfect. You couldn't ask for a better, but the sticky stuff on the edge of that,

316
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:03,860
though. Okay. Yeah. So you're going to fold it over. Fold over the sticky sides like that.

317
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:11,019
I was going to say that wouldn't make any sense. Yeah. They were kidding when they

318
00:48:11,019 --> 00:48:18,329
said this is going to take a while. That's going to do that with, I'm assuming one, two, three,

319
00:48:18,329 --> 00:48:29,320
four. Let's just see. One, two, three, right? Three and four together here. Okay. So one,

320
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:38,380
two, three, four. Let's just get this done nice and quick. Not too quick though,

321
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:43,659
because I don't want to ruin it. Somebody's gave community subs like an hour ago.

322
00:48:45,429 --> 00:48:55,510
Uh, Dr. Steen. Thanks for the five community subs. 20 minutes ago. It's hard for me to see.

323
00:49:00,489 --> 00:49:08,550
Oh God. Good DZ. No. Those are from last night. No, they're not. That's like 18 minutes ago.

324
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:17,300
I've been streaming for like, I've been streaming for like 30 minutes. I can't wait

325
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:21,639
till you guys get to see this. We're going to experience this together. It's going to be so

326
00:49:21,639 --> 00:49:27,780
much fucking fun. I cannot wait. I didn't even sleep last night because I knew how much fun

327
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:31,699
this is going to be. It's like Christmas. You're waiting for Santa. You're waiting for Santa.

328
00:49:31,699 --> 00:49:38,820
Santa's not here yet, but he will be, he will be in like six hours. I can't get this off.

329
00:49:45,300 --> 00:50:04,300
I can't get this one off. I probably looked like so ugly right there. All right. So I'm

330
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:07,340
doing this right, right? So this goes here and this hit, wait, but has it fold over?

331
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:20,179
Or it just doesn't? Huh? How is this? Oh, holy shit. I almost just messed it up.

332
00:50:20,179 --> 00:50:24,340
I was going to put it over here. It's supposed to go like there. I almost just blew that.

333
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:41,800
That would have been really bad. It's Nintendo Labo. So guys, I gotta tell you something.

334
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:48,659
I went back to the dentist, right? I had another dentist appointment today. I was there

335
00:50:48,659 --> 00:50:53,860
earlier and you have no fucking idea how fucked up this was. So I'm in the chair,

336
00:50:53,860 --> 00:51:03,639
right? I don't want to mess this up. Where does this one go? No, it's not that. Put it over here.

337
00:51:03,639 --> 00:51:17,829
They both go side by side. Three, four. Yep. Okay. Three. And let's get this other one. Four.

338
00:51:17,829 --> 00:51:31,800
Then these, these pieces of, these ones are bigger somehow. Oh, 15 turtles. They make

339
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:42,869
these things so hard to fucking remove. I think that looks good, right? Both these fold over,

340
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:57,420
I hope. All right. Then what do I do with the big ones? So these are longer and they go

341
00:51:58,059 --> 00:52:09,059
just across the whole thing. All right. What are you saying? Seinfeld? What was the dentist

342
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:13,739
story? Oh, you can't believe it. So how about the chair? No, that's a joke because I've had,

343
00:52:13,739 --> 00:52:20,059
I've had three dentist stories in the last two weeks. Tell the rest of the dentist story.

344
00:52:22,219 --> 00:52:31,079
So how about the dentist? All right. That's correct, right? Yeah. Too long one. Then here

345
00:52:31,079 --> 00:52:39,539
and here. How the fuck did that go? I have no idea. And? No, there is no and. I've already

346
00:52:39,539 --> 00:52:46,550
told it. I told it two days ago. The joke is I have a third dentist story. But you know,

347
00:52:46,550 --> 00:52:50,309
that's, that's just the punch line. There is no punch line. Oh, here's another dentist story

348
00:52:50,309 --> 00:53:00,760
incoming. There is no punch line. I wasn't even making a joke. I was making a reference

349
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:12,500
to me having problems with the dentist every day. I need closure. There is, why do you need

350
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:23,289
closure on a non-existent story that didn't happen? All right. Speed it up. These go

351
00:53:23,289 --> 00:53:32,619
across here and then here. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Yes. I've got bad teeth.

352
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:42,659
What did you say? Have you seen these? I can bite. I can take a Jolly Rancher guys and

353
00:53:42,659 --> 00:53:50,809
go like this and I can bite right through it. I was that guy in middle school and high school

354
00:53:50,809 --> 00:53:56,730
that had the fucking steel teeth. You guys remember now and laters? I used to just put

355
00:53:56,730 --> 00:53:59,769
them in and just stop chewing and people would fucking gasp and freak out and like my teeth are

356
00:53:59,769 --> 00:54:15,929
gonna get ripped out. Nope. We'll be done with the tedious part here in a second.

357
00:54:16,650 --> 00:54:23,190
That explains a lot actually. Does it though? What does that explain?

358
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:29,219
I'm, I feel like that doesn't explain a whole lot. I feel like there's way more to

359
00:54:29,219 --> 00:54:43,380
that story. Where's the other one? I'm missing one. Where'd it go? Where's eight? Where did

360
00:54:43,380 --> 00:55:20,119
eight go? Check the table crease? No. Where is it? One, two, three, four, five. Check the

361
00:55:20,119 --> 00:55:33,619
VOD. No. There's one more. What the fuck did I do with it? Christ. I bent it too.

362
00:55:35,610 --> 00:55:44,019
They look exactly the same. Give me a break. All right. Now I have to like move this back

363
00:55:44,019 --> 00:55:50,260
because the table is now out of the view. I need to go back here. There we go. No,

364
00:55:50,260 --> 00:56:01,420
I'll get a little closer to you guys. Hey. He doesn't know. I don't know very much. You're

365
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:08,730
right. See you have this, you have this like periscope right now. You can like see everything.

366
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:12,730
You can like zoom in and be like, what's that stain? I don't know there's a stain on my

367
00:56:12,730 --> 00:56:19,369
shirt. I have no idea. Did I eat like a hot dog with mustard on it earlier? Yes, I did.

368
00:56:19,369 --> 00:56:35,260
I don't know. I may have dropped something. I don't care. I don't know. All right. So now

369
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:41,559
these turn over and fold in. All right. We can finally be done with this tedious sticker game.

370
00:56:44,889 --> 00:56:53,699
That and then like this. Come on. All right. Done. Finally. That took a million years.

371
00:56:55,590 --> 00:57:05,500
The whole thing's done. Fold it over. So is a hot dog a sandwich? No, I would call it a sub.

372
00:57:06,219 --> 00:57:10,460
I mean a sub would. Is a sub a sandwich? Sub sandwich, right? I guess it is a sandwich.

373
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:18,219
But a lot of people tell you it's not a sandwich, that it's a hoagie or it's a grinder.

374
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:25,179
It's not a sandwich. It's a hoagie. It's a grinder, right? Hot dog is not. Well, hot dog is.

375
00:57:26,539 --> 00:57:46,460
It is. What happens here now? Well, I played Zelda VR. Well, this is not my switch. So I

376
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:53,400
don't. My switch is dead. Like permanently dead. Unless I did something wrong, which I

377
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:59,800
know I didn't. All right. So this folds all the way over and then attaches together like this.

378
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:09,510
I'm assuming that the arrows line up and line up the markings and push it in firmly.

379
00:58:10,469 --> 00:58:20,250
Once it slides in like this, how the fuck does that go in? I guess like that.

380
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:29,929
Are taco sandwiches? I mean they could be. If you want to break it down by it just it's

381
00:58:29,929 --> 00:58:42,920
very definition. That one's in. All right. That's good. So that's done. Is everything

382
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:50,579
lined up perfectly like this? Make sure your piece matches up. Yeah, I think so. Right.

383
00:58:50,579 --> 00:58:58,679
What do you guys think? Yeah. Yeah, it is. Flour tortilla. Flour. I mean, I don't know.

384
00:58:58,679 --> 00:59:04,699
I'm not going to. I'm not going to get in a fight over this. So give the slot a check

385
00:59:04,699 --> 00:59:12,969
from the side too. If it looks a little at all wonky, just straighten it up. I mean,

386
00:59:12,969 --> 00:59:20,860
it's a little wonky. A little bit. This looks like I'm about to put a hard drive in here.

387
00:59:24,119 --> 00:59:31,349
Here's my new keyless hard drive bay. Toolless hard drive. All right. This is wonky, but it'll

388
00:59:31,349 --> 00:59:40,500
do. Does it really matter? I got a fucking Vive set up. Do you think I'd give a shit about

389
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:53,110
this being wonky by like 5%? I got a Vive right here. All right. That's good. Stand it

390
00:59:53,110 --> 01:00:01,940
back up. And with that, how does this connect to here? Let's see if your console slot does

391
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:06,260
its job. Now is also a good time to straighten your slot out if it's gotten crooked at all.

392
01:00:09,269 --> 01:00:39,030
So I have to slide that into here and make sure it fits. Ow. And it does. That fits pretty

393
01:00:39,030 --> 01:00:50,679
good. Snug. Fits in there. So it can come out nice and easy too. That's a perfect fit.

394
01:00:51,860 --> 01:01:01,429
Nice. Let's stick that back in. All right. It should come back on the screen here in a second.

395
01:01:01,429 --> 01:01:17,139
All right. Let's go. Not on my screen though. Shit's too loud. That's better. All right. So

396
01:01:17,139 --> 01:01:38,920
that works. Now, where do I put this from here? This is just porn music. This is not porn

397
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:53,829
music. What are you talking about? This is like arcade claw machine music. This is not

398
01:01:53,829 --> 01:02:01,559
pornography music. This is the song you hear playing over and over again inside of every

399
01:02:01,559 --> 01:02:06,539
Dave and Buster's you've ever been inside ever in your life. But that's not true. They play

400
01:02:06,539 --> 01:02:12,440
like, they play the hits. They play the hits. I'm wrong. I'm sorry. All right. What

401
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:19,639
are you B? Yeah. What the fuck are you watching? What are you talking about?

402
01:02:26,619 --> 01:02:39,639
That's porn music. What does this one do? Dude, I'm starting to feel like a little

403
01:02:39,639 --> 01:02:43,320
drunk right now. Maybe I should like lick something that's a small cartridge related

404
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:54,139
thing. Oh, that'd be like fucking funny. All right. So let's go. What's this piece for?

405
01:02:54,139 --> 01:02:58,380
Your nose, of course. Leave the printed side facing up as you crease these fools.

406
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:13,739
Okay. All right. Crease this up there. Any other piece? I wish I had a nose.

407
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:20,469
So this is going to like slip on like this. I think my nose is too big for this.

408
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:26,019
Yeah. I've got like a schnoz. So I don't know if this is going to work.

409
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:39,909
We'll see. We will find out very shortly. So that goes up like this. Okay. Look,

410
01:03:39,909 --> 01:03:43,510
you want to see how disgusting of a human I really am? I just like put this on my

411
01:03:43,510 --> 01:03:56,070
nose for a second. Who's that? Who's that villain? There's a villain. There's a bad guy

412
01:03:56,070 --> 01:04:04,090
in like comic books that's always covered in like grease. What's his name? There's like a

413
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:24,840
greasy villain. I don't know. The Silver Surfer? The Silver Surfer is like kind of just covered

414
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:34,760
in oil, right? Yeah, I would be the Silver Surfer. He's fucking cool too, man. He like

415
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:42,119
skis around and blows up planets, right? That's like his MO, right? That's what he does.

416
01:04:48,059 --> 01:04:58,099
No, no, no. That's Iceman. What does the Silver Surfer do? What is the Silver Surfer? What's

417
01:04:58,099 --> 01:05:07,030
the difference between Silver Surfer and Iceman? They're the same. I don't, I can't. If you

418
01:05:07,030 --> 01:05:12,630
had like a crime lineup and you told me to pick out the Silver Surfer and you had Iceman,

419
01:05:12,630 --> 01:05:17,030
you had Flame Guy and you had like Colossus, I don't know if I'd be able to pick him out.

420
01:05:17,030 --> 01:05:34,179
It would be hard. Iceman, I mean, what? He's like chrome. Yeah. What does he do?

421
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:49,619
He's silver and he surfs. Isn't he a fantastic four villain? No wonder those movies have been

422
01:05:49,619 --> 01:05:58,949
so bad. What a cursed franchise. Wait, okay. What the hell's going on? It goes this way

423
01:05:58,949 --> 01:06:19,380
and then you do it the other way. So it's that and then that side. Yep. Fantastic four.

424
01:06:23,239 --> 01:06:26,599
We got, okay, what is this? Let's get the smooths. No more stickers. I don't want to

425
01:06:26,599 --> 01:06:33,510
put more stickers on here. We only need one sticker for now. Thank God. Was this,

426
01:06:33,510 --> 01:06:45,860
is this to like determine where you are in the room? Wait, don't do this yet.

427
01:06:45,860 --> 01:06:55,019
First fold the piece firmly in half like that. So that's that. This,

428
01:06:55,900 --> 01:07:01,690
they're, yes, they are lined up perfectly. This part needs to be neatly lined up. It's easy

429
01:07:01,690 --> 01:07:11,989
to get it wrong. Be careful. That's in there. That's perfect. Now using the star symbol as a

430
01:07:11,989 --> 01:07:18,630
guide, apply the first half of the sticker and then it wraps around. You kind of like

431
01:07:18,630 --> 01:07:27,159
an adhesive tape. All right, I guess, is that what this is for? To be adhesive tape?

432
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:38,340
These are thin too. Oh boy, this is really thin. Make sure you guys can see.

433
01:07:40,059 --> 01:07:49,769
Fuck. Damn it. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Got it. And then fold it over the other side.

434
01:07:53,079 --> 01:08:04,760
No air bubbles. Good. Yeah, so it is just like adhesive tape. Everybody calm down. Stream

435
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:17,079
over, folks. Time to go home. What? Why are you going home? Don't go home. We've got,

436
01:08:17,159 --> 01:08:21,239
we've got a whole bottle of wine here. Are you going to go home? No, you stay

437
01:08:24,220 --> 01:08:35,850
or go to a different channel that you enjoy. See you later. Don't leave me. Don't leave me here.

438
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:39,930
If you leave, I'm just a guy folding cardboard drinking wine. You can't leave.

439
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:49,560
Don't leave me here. I'm just like a sicko if you all leave. All right, flip the piece

440
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:57,500
over and show it on screen and lift this part up. Okay. Like the second you guys all leave,

441
01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:10,119
I just become the weirdo. What'd you do on a Saturday night? I just drank and played with

442
01:09:10,119 --> 01:09:19,579
a kid's cardboard toy for six hours. Oh, you didn't like, you did? Yeah. Yeah. Don't

443
01:09:19,579 --> 01:09:33,189
you have a girlfriend? Yeah. Where was she? I don't know. You know, I can't, no, this

444
01:09:33,189 --> 01:09:42,619
can't be like that. All right. So we just slide this into here. This is kind of an

445
01:09:42,619 --> 01:09:53,300
awkward way to do that. That looks good. Check the closet. No, I already did that before the

446
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:58,260
stream starts. She's not in there. Stand it straight. Time to stand the whole piece up

447
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:07,079
nice and sprayed. That's the way. Okay. So it does stand on its own. I'm gonna get it straight

448
01:10:07,079 --> 01:10:15,670
like this. There you go. Okay. The nose piece is complete. So how does my nose go in here?

449
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:41,609
Like this? This hurts. I'm just a rooster. I guess it's supposed to be like that. The

450
01:10:41,609 --> 01:10:46,170
bridge of my nose is so fucked up. Those are gonna be painful. All right. Fit the nose into

451
01:10:46,170 --> 01:10:52,680
the main lens frame. Open up the top and lay it out flat. All right. We gotta do some surgery

452
01:10:52,680 --> 01:11:00,170
here. Excuse me. Make sure you get that line over there. I don't want that to go down.

453
01:11:00,890 --> 01:11:08,020
So then this, how does this open? So this goes like this. So you pop it out here

454
01:11:08,899 --> 01:11:19,430
and then lay it out like that. Now move the nose piece into position, into position,

455
01:11:20,069 --> 01:11:28,310
into position, into position. Why was I saying that so weird? Like that. Oh, there's a little

456
01:11:28,310 --> 01:11:32,390
slot there. But now for this part, it'll be easiest if you hold the lens piece as shown.

457
01:11:34,779 --> 01:11:39,659
Yeah. Slide the red tab with the smooth sticker right into the slot in between the lenses.

458
01:11:43,180 --> 01:11:47,100
Let's check from the other side too. Just look firmly inserted. So it just goes in here.

459
01:11:48,619 --> 01:12:08,140
That goes like this. And that's it. It's in. That's in. No, it's not. Fuck. How do I keep

460
01:12:08,140 --> 01:12:16,390
it in there? Let's check from the other side too. Just look for, it's not firmly inserted.

461
01:12:18,329 --> 01:12:26,970
Show auto. No, no. I'm building a VR headset. No, we're not going to show auto. No auto.

462
01:12:27,689 --> 01:12:34,380
I'm not showing auto. Show auto. Yeah. Where are we going to put him? Where's he going to go?

463
01:12:34,939 --> 01:12:40,760
There's no room for him in here. No, I'm not showing. I'm not. All right. I'll show auto in

464
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:51,130
like two hours. Okay. How does this go in? Let's add the console slot. So this is, it

465
01:12:51,130 --> 01:13:04,810
goes like this and then spins this way. Just like that. Down here. This is ridiculous.

466
01:13:04,810 --> 01:13:12,649
How am I going to see this? It's two little feet should slide neatly into place in here.

467
01:13:13,689 --> 01:13:32,539
Is this the wrong way? All right. It's two little feet are in there now. In. Come on,

468
01:13:32,539 --> 01:13:44,649
get in there. Is it in? It's two little feet go in and then now lift the middle flap and

469
01:13:44,649 --> 01:13:49,210
join it to this slot at the top of the nose piece. It might be tough, but push it all the

470
01:13:49,210 --> 01:14:02,279
way in. Okay. So is this even in there? So this, I can't even tell if it's even in.

471
01:14:02,279 --> 01:14:05,960
I think it is. All right. So then this piece comes up. I didn't fold this fucking piece. I

472
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:12,390
didn't fold this piece backwards. Why didn't somebody tell me I didn't do that? Nobody

473
01:14:12,390 --> 01:14:37,260
told me I didn't fold it. Is it in? Oh, okay. Now it's in. Is that good? Oh,

474
01:14:38,970 --> 01:14:53,380
no. God damn it. The whole thing came apart. A bunch of trained engineers to put this shit

475
01:14:53,380 --> 01:15:19,720
together with one hand. Get back in there. And this feet go in there. All right. All

476
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:21,720
right. All right. All right. All right. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

477
01:15:23,670 --> 01:15:34,439
It's in. It's in. Done. That's it. That's it. And hey, Otto can fix it. Otto's not coming up

478
01:15:34,439 --> 01:15:40,220
here. Can you see the little, can you see the console slots, little feet poking out the side?

479
01:15:50,409 --> 01:16:03,079
Yes. Yes, I can. Yes. See? And on the other side. Yes, I can see the little thing popping

480
01:16:03,079 --> 01:16:10,680
out. Oh, and the bottom of the slot is still properly connected, right? Always best to make

481
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:23,930
sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Great. Then let's finish this thing up. First, roll the lens piece over

482
01:16:23,930 --> 01:16:41,340
onto its front. Okay. If it lines up perfectly with this fold here, the next part should be

483
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:49,270
a piece of cake. It does. I would call that, I would call that perfect. If I were going to

484
01:16:49,270 --> 01:16:54,859
get a ruler out here. Lift up the great big top flap and tuck it under the plastic here

485
01:16:54,859 --> 01:17:14,300
like we did before. Okay. So then tuck that in like that. So that's in and secure. Now

486
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:20,899
secure the sides. So slide it down and tab it. Do the same thing on the other side, right?

487
01:17:22,460 --> 01:17:55,289
This happened here. Tab it. All right. Same thing on this side. Slide it in. Get that

488
01:17:55,289 --> 01:18:09,260
tab in there. Beautiful. Accomplishments. We're making them. We're making them.

489
01:18:09,260 --> 01:18:13,180
Now before we make sure that the whole flap is still neatly tucked into place.

490
01:18:13,180 --> 01:18:22,439
It is. That's, that's good to go. Close that other side. And are these corners tucked into

491
01:18:22,439 --> 01:18:36,819
place too? Yes. Yes, they are. Is this slot still a neat rectangle? Yeah. I think so.

492
01:18:40,789 --> 01:18:43,989
Now stand up our goggles. Here's a little tip you want to remember.

493
01:18:46,069 --> 01:18:57,979
Why is there water on this? It's not okay. Freaked out. Master hand. What is it? Do you

494
01:18:57,979 --> 01:19:22,630
see this symbol on the top right? Yes. Try giving it a little tap. Okay. Is this supposed

495
01:19:22,630 --> 01:19:31,319
to do something? I don't think that does anything. I think, I think I'm just doing

496
01:19:31,319 --> 01:19:38,250
that for no reason. The VR goggles are complete. You guys get, you guys get the

497
01:19:38,250 --> 01:19:42,010
fuck in there. Hope you know that. We're going to, you're getting the fuck in here.

498
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:49,220
You can experience VR for the first time. That's the bulk of the work done. Nice job. All

499
01:19:49,220 --> 01:19:55,819
I need to know is build an important little accessory, which is what? Three to four. You

500
01:19:55,819 --> 01:20:00,539
mean three more pieces. Make it a safety cap. Oh great. Do I need this? What if I just don't

501
01:20:00,539 --> 01:20:08,810
build this? Who cares? Remove this one piece from A. Like what if I just don't give a shit

502
01:20:08,810 --> 01:20:30,340
about safety right here? Just that one? That's it? That's it, right? Punch this out.

503
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:41,220
Safety cap. I wonder what this is for. I wonder. That's that. Punch this shit out.

504
01:20:41,859 --> 01:20:54,550
Push this side. These are both out, right? Yep. All right. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good.

505
01:20:55,430 --> 01:20:59,590
It's going to be a hell of a vacuum job in here later. All right. That's good. Move

506
01:20:59,590 --> 01:21:03,189
this out of the way. I don't think I need these anymore, but I'll put it here and

507
01:21:03,189 --> 01:21:10,949
definitely need this. Don't want to lose this one. I am stuffing my legs underneath this

508
01:21:10,949 --> 01:21:16,439
table right now because I have to put this all the way down. I need a different chair.

509
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:31,319
I need a specific Nintendo Labo seat. Put on real pants. These are J. Crew shorts. They're

510
01:21:31,319 --> 01:21:37,739
very nice and they were extraordinarily expensive. They were more than like 80 bucks.

511
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:42,060
These are fantastic pants. They can do anything. They can go anywhere.

512
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:53,399
You can wear these wherever the fuck you want. It's all made up. None of that was real.

513
01:21:54,359 --> 01:21:59,979
God, these are fucking Walmart. They were on the clearance rack for like four bucks.

514
01:22:01,829 --> 01:22:10,300
All right. Let's go. J. Crew CEO in the chat. I'm getting wine, love. That's how you know

515
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:13,659
it's really starting to kick off here. All right. Time to put together the safety cap.

516
01:22:13,659 --> 01:22:17,420
This accessory will make sure the console doesn't fall out while you're in the...

517
01:22:17,420 --> 01:22:21,500
Okay. I wasn't going to make this. Oh yeah. Who cares your shit? I don't need

518
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:32,760
a safety cap. I thought it meant like my safety. All right. Rich streamer.

519
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:42,409
Like that. I'm going to take this outside and just try to like

520
01:22:42,409 --> 01:22:46,409
burn something. I'm going to like burn some grass. Just like I'm going to take

521
01:22:46,409 --> 01:22:50,409
one blade of grass to see what I can do. Don't do that at home. Don't do that because

522
01:22:50,409 --> 01:23:02,979
I said to do it. Fold this. Do I have to start putting a disclaimer on every stream

523
01:23:02,979 --> 01:23:09,689
that says just don't listen to a word I say. Jerma lied about Ace Attorney. Thank you for

524
01:23:09,689 --> 01:23:15,699
the 10 community subs. Jerma lied about Ace Attorney. That's 10 subs. Thank you so much

525
01:23:15,699 --> 01:23:19,619
for the 10 subs. I didn't lie about Ace Attorney. I told you the truth actually.

526
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:30,300
I told you the truth about Ace Attorney. How is that a lie? I said that's not a lie. Oh my

527
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:36,340
God. Somebody asked me about what happened to Ace Attorney and I very truthfully, very

528
01:23:36,340 --> 01:23:42,310
transparently told them and everybody like three times. Ace Attorney is not I don't even

529
01:23:42,310 --> 01:23:49,079
know why am I explaining this a third time. Ace Attorney is a series that I did not think

530
01:23:49,079 --> 01:23:52,840
I thought it was a different kind of game. And I said I was going to play it off stream

531
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:57,479
and see if I wanted to stream it and then we'll see. But I kind of hung it up a

532
01:23:57,479 --> 01:24:02,279
little bit though. It's not happening. So that's not lying. That's me telling the

533
01:24:02,279 --> 01:24:10,100
truth. That's just the truth. That's me telling you a truthful statement. A lie would be I'm going

534
01:24:10,100 --> 01:24:13,859
to play Ace Attorney tomorrow and I don't play Ace Attorney at all. And you say where's Ace

535
01:24:13,859 --> 01:24:25,539
Attorney? And I go I didn't say I was going to play Ace Attorney. That's a lie. The text

536
01:24:25,539 --> 01:24:32,789
game Resident Sleeper. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what I'm doing. Guys,

537
01:24:32,789 --> 01:24:37,430
I don't know what I'm doing any day. Okay. If you think I got a plan. I plan out very

538
01:24:37,430 --> 01:24:44,489
specific stream. But like drink wine and play Labo. Kind of just happened like six days ago.

539
01:24:44,489 --> 01:24:48,649
It's like oh yeah let's just do that. We'll do that on like fucking Saturday. I don't even

540
01:24:48,649 --> 01:24:53,449
think I got a plan. The dunk tank is a plan. That's going to happen. That takes a while.

541
01:24:54,489 --> 01:24:57,050
Day-to-day basis. I don't even know what fucking I'm eating for breakfast.

542
01:24:58,010 --> 01:25:04,310
All right. All these are done. And then we're going to fold the whole thing up.

543
01:25:04,310 --> 01:25:27,609
So like this. Connect this and this. Weird man. This is weird. Really. Don't embarrass

544
01:25:27,609 --> 01:25:31,560
me here. Come on. Get in there. Don't embarrass me. Don't embarrass me please.

545
01:25:32,279 --> 01:25:36,220
Come on. They make fun of me every time I stream. Don't let them make fun of this.

546
01:25:36,220 --> 01:25:41,399
Come on. Jerma you're bad at that game. Jerma you suck. I died again. Come on. Don't let

547
01:25:41,399 --> 01:25:47,930
them do this. Come on. Come on. They make fun of me every time I play a game. Not this

548
01:25:47,930 --> 01:26:09,670
time. Thank god. Pointing and laughing at you this time. That's not what you said.

549
01:26:11,020 --> 01:26:17,699
Pointing and laughing at you this time. I don't know where that came from. This time.

550
01:26:22,279 --> 01:26:25,239
All right. Safety cap's done. Let's practice putting on the safety cap.

551
01:26:26,039 --> 01:26:41,939
So the safety cap just slides down on top of here. Like that. All right. My mom has

552
01:26:41,939 --> 01:26:57,140
a shirt like that. Okay. What? Anything else? Is there anything else I need to know?

553
01:26:57,699 --> 01:27:17,109
My mom has a shirt like that. Okay. It's a purple shirt. The whole website you're on

554
01:27:17,109 --> 01:27:32,470
right now is a purple t-shirt. Okay. Don't think it. Don't be fooled. It looks great.

555
01:27:34,890 --> 01:27:42,789
Take the safety cap off. And put it over there for now. Okay. Looks good.

556
01:27:42,789 --> 01:27:46,390
When you're playing with the VR goggles alone, always make sure to put the safety cap on.

557
01:27:48,439 --> 01:27:51,739
Okay. Goggles and safety cap are ready. There's one more. What's the last piece here?

558
01:27:52,380 --> 01:27:57,979
We're going to add the console and the Joy-Con. Oh, this is where we're going to get to play.

559
01:27:58,539 --> 01:28:05,220
Oh my god. I'm fucking, I cannot wait. You won't be able to use TV mode for this part.

560
01:28:05,220 --> 01:28:10,539
Take the console out of the dock. All right. Hold on. This cannot be played in TV mode.

561
01:28:11,670 --> 01:28:29,539
Let me experience it first. Hold on. So you, I'm going to do it first and then you guys

562
01:28:29,539 --> 01:28:36,170
can do it after. This is going to be fucking awesome. How do you capture without the dock?

563
01:28:36,170 --> 01:28:43,689
I point it into the lens over there and I walk around with you guys. That's hot.

564
01:28:43,689 --> 01:28:47,460
That's the only way. All right. Let me, hold on. I got to put the screen on so I don't

565
01:28:47,460 --> 01:29:13,420
fucking embarrass myself somehow. All right. Hold on. Is that here? Okay. All right. So

566
01:29:14,380 --> 01:29:22,710
without further ado. Never mind. All right. So then how does this work?

567
01:29:25,060 --> 01:29:33,189
So now make sure you have the both Joy-Cons. Sorry. Hold on. I'll get this back on here.

568
01:29:33,189 --> 01:29:39,109
Camera. Okay. Sorry. Just wanted to make sure nobody could say anything bad about me.

569
01:29:39,109 --> 01:29:46,100
All right. So here I have the left and the right controller. Let's turn the volume up

570
01:29:46,100 --> 01:29:52,729
so you can at least hear it. Maybe it's just a song. So who cares? All right.

571
01:29:53,609 --> 01:29:59,539
I think I have to attach these. The time has come to remove the final seal. Done, done,

572
01:29:59,539 --> 01:30:07,659
done. Oh, I'm taking up. I'm taking this off. Okay. Go ahead. Peel off the film.

573
01:30:18,170 --> 01:30:29,859
Yeah. Wow. Whoa. That's weird. That's really weird. That's strange. I can't even describe

574
01:30:29,859 --> 01:30:38,090
what that looks like. All right. That's off. I'll let you guys see it in a minute.

575
01:30:39,239 --> 01:30:46,939
It's my turn with the VR. Okay. Let's fill in on how to hold the VR goggles while using them.

576
01:30:51,670 --> 01:30:55,189
Always grip them firmly with both hands like this and of course you'll want to make sure

577
01:30:55,189 --> 01:31:03,000
you're holding them the right way. Okay. Finally let's practice looking through the

578
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:12,020
VR goggles. I don't need to practice that. Okay. Let's slip it in there. Let's try it.

579
01:31:12,020 --> 01:31:18,340
Come on. And with that we can finally say the VR goggles are ready to roll. Let's go.

580
01:31:19,609 --> 01:31:34,039
Whole new virtual world awaits. All right. Let's get it in there. I get to do it first.

581
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:43,979
Okay. Here we go. Wow. That's so cool. All right. Hold on. Let me move this.

582
01:31:44,859 --> 01:31:54,119
I gotta pick something. Hold on. I gotta pick. This actually hurts my head.

583
01:31:55,460 --> 01:32:03,399
All right. What do you guys think? Dinosaur Safari sounds fucking awesome to me.

584
01:32:06,710 --> 01:32:18,199
There's Mario Brothers. Mario Paint. I think Dinosaur Safari. Put on the safety. All right.

585
01:32:18,199 --> 01:32:26,250
Safety goggles are on. Dinosaur Adventure. Okay. Are you guys good? I'm going to do it first.

586
01:32:32,710 --> 01:32:40,710
What the fuck? Holy shit. What the fuck? That's a T-Rex. Oh my god.

587
01:32:43,579 --> 01:32:52,970
That's a doctor. Oh my god. This is more realistic than Vive. Whoa. Oh my god. He's

588
01:32:52,970 --> 01:33:03,699
right here. He's literally right in front of me. Hey. You guys gotta see this shit. Seriously.

589
01:33:09,289 --> 01:33:18,520
Wow. No, no, no, no, no. Drive. Drive the car. Drive, drive, drive.

590
01:33:19,159 --> 01:33:24,819
Drive the car. Drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive. He's behind us.

591
01:33:28,310 --> 01:33:55,529
Whoa. Holy fuck. Now this is Stegosaurus. Stegosaurus and then the T-Rex. This is

592
01:33:55,529 --> 01:34:16,699
called Fight of the Century. Jesus. He's so cute. Who's that? It's hard to tell. I can't see.

593
01:34:17,659 --> 01:34:19,180
There we go. No, no. I was blurred out for a little bit.

594
01:34:27,449 --> 01:34:41,539
All right. How about that? I had to quit on. I got disconnected. Oh, wait. Oh, what's this one?

595
01:34:42,180 --> 01:34:51,880
This is called Dino Adventure. They have like at least two or three dinosaur related games.

596
01:34:52,680 --> 01:35:11,510
This is so cool. This is a good person here. Oh, I can see it. It's up there.

597
01:35:12,550 --> 01:35:29,109
That's a Pterodactyl. Oh my god. The Pterodactyl is huge. Who's that? Oh, it's a Triceratops.

598
01:35:30,149 --> 01:35:35,899
I didn't know they eat it. I didn't know they eat plants. Holy fuck. That's amazing.

599
01:35:37,020 --> 01:35:57,960
I thought that they ate meat. You guys getting this? Watch the turtle.

600
01:36:24,859 --> 01:36:33,500
I'm not going to. I'm not going to put on like the turtles having sex. I mean, I was going to

601
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:39,180
fucking be in there and watch like the turtles having sex thing. But like, come on. I'd like to

602
01:36:39,180 --> 01:37:00,140
keep my Twitch TV channel. All right. So here's the real question though. Don't make me. Hold on.

603
01:37:00,779 --> 01:37:10,979
What is it? What's it called? What is it actually called? It's called like life,

604
01:37:10,979 --> 01:37:17,989
life source or something. Life scenes. What was the actual name of the television show?

605
01:37:19,779 --> 01:37:40,100
I'm not going to type into Google turtle sex. Are you out of your mind? This might be worth

606
01:37:40,100 --> 01:38:03,939
doing it. I need to like be able to hear it. In nature, it's rare to form such a life long.

607
01:38:10,699 --> 01:38:14,699
What's this called? This is called nature. Oh, a nature documentary.

608
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:32,340
List of circling. Oh, turtles. Before she accepts his advances.

609
01:38:34,250 --> 01:38:39,609
Oh, wow. Is there a whale over there? Can you guys see the fishes?

610
01:38:41,850 --> 01:38:48,329
Their first breath together is the beginning of several hours of mating.

611
01:38:49,930 --> 01:38:54,010
Several hours. Oh, well, I don't have to hold on as tight as he can

612
01:38:54,010 --> 01:39:04,979
to keep her all to himself. Interesting. Unfortunately, they have company.

613
01:39:04,979 --> 01:39:11,300
What's that? Another male. What's another thing he can to separate the pair and mate

614
01:39:11,300 --> 01:39:15,060
with the female himself. There he goes. He's he's coming up to the behind the other guy.

615
01:39:17,060 --> 01:39:19,779
What? That's the soft vulnerable parts.

616
01:39:28,569 --> 01:39:31,770
He's punching him in the head. He's like punching him in the face over and over again.

617
01:39:32,569 --> 01:39:41,140
Out of his rival.

618
01:39:43,460 --> 01:39:54,489
Wait, what? What's going on over here? The female is struggling now with the extra weight on her

619
01:39:54,489 --> 01:40:00,890
back. She will need to surface to take a breath. There's a turtle over here. There's

620
01:40:00,890 --> 01:40:09,479
two more turtles that way. Another male. He's over here. What's he doing?

621
01:40:17,270 --> 01:40:25,109
This is fucking crazy. More competition. What? There's like three. Whoa. And here's another.

622
01:40:28,420 --> 01:40:31,539
All right, I don't want to. I want to get out. I want to get back to Super Mario Brothers.

623
01:40:32,500 --> 01:40:38,739
Out. I want to get out. I want to get out. I don't want to see this anymore. This is like

624
01:40:38,739 --> 01:40:43,060
three that fight each other. Now the female has they're like fighting each other locked on

625
01:40:43,060 --> 01:41:12,010
her back and it's twice as hard for her. Now we're done with that bit. It's over. He wasn't

626
01:41:12,010 --> 01:41:17,369
wearing the safety cap. I'm just imagining like if somebody was actually in VR and like just

627
01:41:17,369 --> 01:41:25,859
watching that. It's like I say that. I say that. But aren't there like specific VR apps

628
01:41:26,579 --> 01:41:36,500
where you just like watch people? Like oh I'm just gonna sit here and just like stare at

629
01:41:36,500 --> 01:41:50,359
people. That's so weird. Like I don't know. Like I can't. VR porn. No man like that's too

630
01:41:50,359 --> 01:41:54,520
fucking much. I don't know. That's too weird for me. And I'll tell you a couple of reasons why.

631
01:41:54,520 --> 01:41:58,359
Listen to me. This is important. Story time. This is not a story. This is not like it

632
01:41:58,359 --> 01:42:05,000
really happened. But just listen. If you're 18 plus conversation coming up here. Okay so

633
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:08,920
if you're not like you're not of the age fucking 18 then close. Just get out of here.

634
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:19,449
Leave. Just leave. Come back in like 20 minutes. If you have a VR helmet on your head and you're

635
01:42:19,449 --> 01:42:25,770
going to watch pornography and you're going to have the VR helmet headphones and your hands

636
01:42:25,770 --> 01:42:33,560
out here with like the controllers and you're gonna be like you know you'd better be alone

637
01:42:33,560 --> 01:42:40,810
in the fucking house. Better be. You better live alone or you better be certain that your

638
01:42:40,810 --> 01:42:48,500
roommates or your parents are not going to come home. That scares the absolute shit out of me.

639
01:42:48,500 --> 01:42:54,100
And I mean I don't I haven't done that in VR. I haven't. All right let's move on from that.

640
01:42:56,810 --> 01:43:04,699
That's too scary. What if like you're just sitting there enjoying adult material and you're

641
01:43:04,699 --> 01:43:07,500
locked. I've been locked in. I've had people come in this room and I didn't even know they

642
01:43:07,500 --> 01:43:12,659
were here. Imagine how fucking awful that would be and the embarrassment that would entail.

643
01:43:13,220 --> 01:43:18,020
If you did not know somebody opened the door and there is no like whoa hey man knock once knock

644
01:43:18,020 --> 01:43:21,779
for once in your life. No no no no no you're just immersed. You don't even know that they're

645
01:43:21,779 --> 01:43:33,060
there. They could walk in and you're just whoa. Okay I would never in a million years

646
01:43:33,060 --> 01:43:39,939
in a million fucking years. Never. If you're gonna do that and you're gonna enjoy adult

647
01:43:39,939 --> 01:43:46,680
material and you're like you know an adult you're an adult. Before you before you start

648
01:43:46,680 --> 01:43:52,119
just go peek outside and make sure there's no cars in the driveway. Please for your own sake.

649
01:43:59,800 --> 01:44:13,100
I'm just saying. Anyways let's see what's in here. I don't think I was supposed to put it

650
01:44:13,100 --> 01:44:24,340
in yet. And I don't know have like a security camera pointed at that because okay if you're

651
01:44:25,060 --> 01:44:30,760
if you're in if you're doing something in particular that certain thing in particular

652
01:44:30,760 --> 01:44:36,100
we're not going to name anything. This could be anything. If you're in the headset you're

653
01:44:36,100 --> 01:44:40,520
in VR you're fucking sitting in your chair. I don't even know where the hell you'd be.

654
01:44:40,520 --> 01:44:47,960
You need to be you need to be able to get out quick. How do you why does that even exist?

655
01:44:49,159 --> 01:44:56,899
How is that even possible? You get you gotta have if you're gonna do that not only check

656
01:44:56,899 --> 01:45:01,939
that there's no cars in the driveway you're gonna get a nest cam and every like six minutes

657
01:45:02,579 --> 01:45:14,659
like have it pointed at the driveway like okay nobody here no okay you can't lock your door

658
01:45:14,659 --> 01:45:17,300
either because if you lock your door people are gonna be like what's he doing what are they

659
01:45:17,300 --> 01:45:38,630
doing in there? You lock your door it's even worse. Why did that bring it into the bathroom?

660
01:45:43,189 --> 01:45:47,670
Hey what are you doing man? You're bringing your whole computer into the bathroom.

661
01:45:48,310 --> 01:45:56,180
Yeah yeah yeah. But why is that? I didn't do my taxes yet. I'm gonna do my test

662
01:45:56,180 --> 01:46:00,899
and I'm gonna be in there for like two hours. Oh you do your taxes in the bathroom? Yeah

663
01:46:00,899 --> 01:46:04,899
yeah I do my taxes in the bathroom and now I'm gonna take a shower too. I'm gonna

664
01:46:05,859 --> 01:46:27,000
I'm gonna be in the shower too. Jesus Christ look at this. I used to do that. Guys okay not not

665
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:33,289
just no no no anytime I wanted to hide something in the I was doing in the bathroom I would turn

666
01:46:33,289 --> 01:46:39,850
the shower on and turn on the like the water too for like 10 but no no listen listen listen

667
01:46:40,409 --> 01:46:48,119
it was only for like no no no not wasting water listen to me I would turn it on so

668
01:46:48,119 --> 01:46:54,550
people thought I was going in the shower but I was really I was going to the bathroom I was like

669
01:46:54,550 --> 01:46:58,630
actually going to the bathroom and people I don't know I don't know but it's like when you know

the bathroom I'm like taking a shit so like I'm just going to the shower and then you

672
01:47:11,289 --> 01:47:15,289
would go to the bathroom as fast as you can like in eight seconds and then like turn the

673
01:47:15,289 --> 01:47:40,710
shower off oh you guys gotta see this let me do it first for real this works weirdly enough

770
02:10:21,159 --> 02:10:29,659

771
02:10:29,659 --> 02:10:36,649
once for a lol moment okay it's literally every single crease start at the top here

772
02:10:42,380 --> 02:11:04,569
damn people are laughing i don't know why but they are laughing oh there you go there's like

773
02:11:04,569 --> 02:11:12,649

774
02:11:12,649 --> 02:11:27,300
put our power together we can do that right every little tab looks good i got them all

775
02:11:28,359 --> 02:11:35,819
okay put all that boop into good use and start building fold piece up long thin box

776
02:11:35,819 --> 02:11:45,960
so this comes up this i'm assuming wraps all the way around yeah uh yeah it comes across and

777
02:11:45,960 --> 02:12:03,500
this probably goes down into here damn it it's tight fold this in and then that piece slides

778
02:12:03,500 --> 02:12:16,310
over okay next part it just makes a little cylinder okay that's easy enough there there

779
02:12:16,310 --> 02:12:27,899
you go now where does that go just get a job at a box factory and stream it that's not

780
02:12:27,899 --> 02:12:37,300
the same i keep pulling the table further and further in here and it's going to be out a box

781
02:12:37,300 --> 02:12:45,989
what does it what does that mean box factory two full lines crease both the lines and then

782
02:12:45,989 --> 02:13:03,500
it's going to come okay up one two all right and this goes like that the tabs on each end of

783
02:13:03,500 --> 02:13:10,520
the cookie will fit nicely into the slots fold the cookie up like so what the cookie

784
02:13:11,079 --> 02:13:22,890
all right so this goes in like that it's the same on both sides right stick it in both tabs in

898
02:36:36,520 --> 02:36:41,079
a little more because this goes in here like that and then these tabs come out and go in

899
02:36:41,079 --> 02:36:43,379
in this

900
02:36:54,979 --> 02:37:07,450

905
02:37:51,500 --> 02:38:06,180

906
02:38:09,430 --> 02:38:16,440
this controller mark should be up it is and then this will slide all the way in

907
02:38:17,399 --> 02:38:23,190

908
02:38:24,389 --> 02:38:48,600

02:39:20,260 --> 02:39:23,700
pull on the end of the holder does it move a little bit without coming free

914
02:39:27,959 --> 02:39:51,690

915
02:39:51,690 --> 02:39:57,700
just a gentle tug don't tug too hard or the holder might pull free why is it doing that

916
02:40:06,469 --> 02:40:13,079
i mean it's it's not even in there secure i'm look at how gently i'm doing this guys

972
02:50:37,079 --> 02:50:47,719
all right rubber bands small we need one of the smaller ones oh viewers are dropping fast

973
02:50:48,920 --> 02:50:53,159
it's all right it's always yeah having a lot of viewers is cool

974
02:50:54,739 --> 02:50:58,420
but it's all right you know it's not about the viewers not how many viewers you have

975
02:50:59,059 --> 02:51:02,979
it's about how many units you can push a nintendo labo and then tell somebody that comes

976
02:51:02,979 --> 02:51:06,659
you at like a twitch party how many units you sold and then maybe they'll give you like like

977
02:51:06,659 --> 02:51:20,790
30 grand to do it again that's you know that's what matters so this goes in here all the way

978
02:51:21,590 --> 02:51:28,659
will that fit in there got a box of wine cooking wine sponsorship no no one ever

979
02:51:28,659 --> 02:51:32,260
sponsored me it just doesn't happen no one ever sponsored me i'm too much of a rebel

980
02:51:32,260 --> 02:51:39,299
is a rubber band safely in the notches it should look yeah it is it is right yeah that's

981
02:51:39,299 --> 02:51:55,620
in there uh it's time to attach the piece the rest of the core i'm no sir like i'll be real i'm

982
02:51:55,620 --> 02:51:59,299
one of those people that will accept like i never have but if i accept a sponsorship let's

983
02:51:59,299 --> 02:52:02,260
say it's for like a certain drink for like a wine company or something oh you should get

984
02:52:02,260 --> 02:52:06,020
sponsored by a wine company oh that'd be funny but i'm the type of fucking asshole like

985
02:52:06,020 --> 02:52:12,420
weirdo where if i will take a sip of it and go oh that's gross and just be kidding around

986
02:52:12,420 --> 02:52:18,899
and then they'll cut the contract of half so i did this never gonna happen i turn the

987
02:52:18,899 --> 02:52:26,379
core piece over so let me make sure both pieces facing the same direction okay like this

988
02:52:31,780 --> 02:52:43,000
somebody say same yeah same oh they said save okay why am i holding the joy con

989
02:52:43,719 --> 02:52:55,270
because i have to fast forward this is intricate i have to go forward that goes all the way in

990
02:52:55,270 --> 02:53:11,049
here like this that like a little ship kind of lift the cover piece up and slide it on

991
02:53:11,049 --> 02:53:15,700
check that your work to make sure everything lines up like it should i mean that's what's

992
02:53:15,700 --> 02:53:20,100
snapping into place though that's kind of just sitting here is it supposed to just sit there

993
02:53:25,350 --> 02:53:28,870
this doesn't feel like it's all this is not right why is this just flopping around

994
02:53:29,829 --> 02:53:35,379
like it maybe it's just supposed to be like that yes and then the sides go in

995
02:53:36,260 --> 02:53:54,020
okay put it around like that i'm gonna put the brightness up a little bit you guys can't see

996
02:53:54,020 --> 02:54:21,899
i'm gonna put the brightness up that's better it's getting a little darker better you guys

997
02:54:21,899 --> 02:54:34,170
can like actually see better right actually yeah i mean just like make it a little bit brighter so

998
02:54:34,170 --> 02:54:43,290
you can see what's going on all right so what's next the rubber band now has to come up remove

999
02:54:43,290 --> 02:54:50,729
your makeup all right now that's it make sure the rubber band doesn't hasn't come out from

1000
02:54:50,729 --> 02:54:59,430
the under the tabs no it's still there still in there right that's it there's the core the

1001
02:54:59,430 --> 02:55:03,909
whole core is done why does this feel frame rating on the other camera what is up with

1002
02:55:03,909 --> 02:55:50,219
this bullshit this is frame rating for what better that's better worse that's better is it

1003
02:55:50,219 --> 02:56:18,379
washed out how bright is this this is as bright as it can go watch out that's bright right

1004
02:56:18,379 --> 02:56:31,209
that looks good i think that's good you got to see my knee oh heavens to betsy we saw his knee

1005
02:56:31,209 --> 02:56:45,030
all right now this can go in here we're getting the scan lines though what the

1006
02:56:45,030 --> 02:57:01,500
fuck cameras suck all right that's gonna have to do one last check let's try inserting the

1007
02:57:01,500 --> 02:57:06,340
joy con that's the one with the plus button yeah i know what it is so this goes in here like

1008
02:57:06,340 --> 02:57:21,500
that like that so that goes in and this is going to be a little like right something like that

1009
02:57:21,500 --> 02:57:34,569
right why did somebody give me a minus two i just made a sound it doesn't well i'm not

1010
02:57:34,569 --> 02:57:48,940
making a joke everything doesn't be a joke i can't get it out now what is it what does

1011
02:57:48,940 --> 02:57:56,659
it say in the instructions about not being able to remove it from the thing i actually

1012
02:57:56,739 --> 02:58:17,430
i really can't get this out no what the fuck come on i can't get it out it's in there for good

1013
02:58:23,020 --> 02:58:26,540
cut it out i'm not gonna cut it out i just i don't know why it's in there so tight

1014
02:58:29,370 --> 02:58:33,930
they usually don't come out like this it's not this hard to get them out this is so

1015
02:58:33,930 --> 02:58:41,510
deeply in there it's unbelievable you can hear that right like that shouldn't be doing that

1016
02:58:41,510 --> 02:59:01,829
i seriously don't get it i don't know what it's stuck on jesus don't break it all right

1017
02:59:01,829 --> 02:59:24,920
that's it that's it i did it there's a tab on the bottom like that reference to the taco

1018
02:59:24,920 --> 02:59:28,920
belt thing you said that you got a big order and it was completely wrong you complained

1019
02:59:28,920 --> 02:59:41,940
and the manager just broke down crying what the hell are you talking about this didn't happen

1020
02:59:42,500 --> 02:59:52,780
this did this is something that you made this up what are you what they got my order wrong

1021
02:59:52,780 --> 02:59:58,409
and i complained and the manager cried that is a made-up story this did not happen

1022

1024
03:00:11,479 --> 03:00:15,719

03:13:29,860 --> 03:13:34,260
relaxed and hanging out and doing what he wants to do i'm not going to force him to do something

1070

1075
03:14:11,290 --> 03:14:15,139
you know what he looks like same thing with the other one right i'm assuming

1076
03:14:15,780 --> 03:14:32,940
pull the whole thing in half maybe looks like this is coming across all the way around

1077
03:14:34,139 --> 03:14:48,709
that goes into there that go get midas i'm not going to take my roommate's dog out of his

1078
03:14:48,709 --> 03:15:03,030
room to show on camera you guys have lost your minds there it is arrows pointing the right

1079
03:15:03,030 --> 03:15:10,250
way take a moment to check that none of the teeth have gotten folded it doesn't look like

1080
03:15:10,250 --> 03:15:19,020
it right teeth look like they're straight up now we're going to work with this pot what are

1081
03:15:19,020 --> 03:15:24,569
we doing with this pot already got it in the right spot and though i don't spin it

1082
03:15:26,809 --> 03:15:37,770
i'm gonna smash this whole desk i almost just did no dog on stream we need a dog

1083
03:15:40,299 --> 03:15:44,649
you don't need a dog you're fine listen you don't need a dog you don't know what

1084
03:15:44,649 --> 03:15:49,850
responsibility wise it's really hard work you gotta feed it you're gonna take it outside you

1085
03:15:49,850 --> 03:15:54,090
have to take care of it you don't know what it's worth you don't know what it's like

1086
03:16:04,250 --> 03:16:10,139
minus 100 bits that actually looks kind of funny all right uh crease crease crease crease

1087
03:16:10,780 --> 03:16:26,680
crease of all am i a dog no i would have been like a bee or something in a past life

1088
03:16:27,319 --> 03:16:37,579
i would have been like a honeybee like an ant dude in my past life i was definitely a

1089
03:16:37,579 --> 03:16:43,819
cheetah no you weren't you were probably like a bug statistically speaking you were a bug

1090
03:16:44,459 --> 03:16:55,180
i think in my past life i was probably a cat or a wolf no no you're a beetle or one of the

1091
03:16:55,180 --> 03:17:03,059
one of the five trillion different ant colonies in the world let's just be realistic about it

1092
03:17:03,059 --> 03:17:14,059
right all right this closes i'm assuming right i mean it's not cool to think about that

1093
03:17:14,059 --> 03:17:19,420
it's really cool to be a jaguar you weren't a jaguar in your past life unless you hit

1094
03:17:19,420 --> 03:17:33,719
the lottery there we go this folds into here so this goes up like that make sure they're

1095
03:17:33,719 --> 03:17:41,829
facing the right direction pay careful attention to these semi-circles these semi okay so yeah i

1096
03:17:41,829 --> 03:17:51,829
got it the right way right yeah that's correct so face it this way and then stick it through

1097
03:17:51,829 --> 03:17:57,270
here i'm assuming through here let me see if i'm right no i'm not right through the middle

1098
03:17:59,129 --> 03:18:14,409
weirdly enough this just goes in the middle like this that dude what dude all the way

1099
03:18:15,799 --> 03:18:25,139
insert the hexagon into the opening like this it might be a tight fit i mean it's not even going

1100
03:18:25,139 --> 03:18:30,899
in it's not going in what do i do i don't know i don't know what to do it's not going in what

1101
03:18:30,899 --> 03:18:48,950
do i do seriously man like just get in there i mean it's kind of in there kind of not really

1102
03:18:48,950 --> 03:18:57,180
though it's like all fucked up is that what it's supposed to look like no it goes all

1103
03:18:57,180 --> 03:19:07,510
the way in what this is a really tight fit i'm gonna feel like i'm gonna break it

1104
03:19:21,620 --> 03:19:30,629
all the way huh the teeth i did it it's i mean it's there it's all the way through oh

1105
03:19:39,219 --> 03:19:47,350
uh-oh that's not good that really isn't good am i going to actually break a labo for the

1106
03:19:47,350 --> 03:19:56,629
first time i'm supposed to be a labo streamer no it's okay not great but not okay that's

1107
03:19:56,629 --> 03:20:16,180
okay all right close it up that and then this comes across and in close it close it

1108
03:20:16,739 --> 03:20:22,600
close it same thing on this side this is the i guess this is the first part of the cannon

1109
03:20:24,469 --> 03:20:29,190
dude i'm gonna display this this is going right next to king's landing

1110
03:20:29,750 --> 03:20:35,020
as you didn't think i fucking was capable of doing that sponsored labo streamer nope

1111
03:20:36,739 --> 03:20:43,909
nintendo's gonna sponsor this channel drinking alcohol on stream they wouldn't want this they

1112
03:20:43,909 --> 03:20:57,340
wouldn't allow that it would be a huge problem that's good i think that's the whole thing

1113
03:20:57,340 --> 03:21:07,110
right and then the tab goes down and sticks in the corner here it's a little notch there

1114
03:21:08,069 --> 03:21:20,979
it's in there now okay it's in now what the last thing to do for this piece is to talk the

1115
03:21:20,979 --> 03:21:26,219
flap the little tooth should slot right into the opening okay there's no there's not

1116
03:21:26,219 --> 03:21:45,819
any music what did i do he already did i miss big bits where i didn't there's no big bits

1117
03:21:45,819 --> 03:21:58,120

1119
03:22:10,889 --> 03:22:16,500

1120
03:22:16,500 --> 03:22:24,440
me that well it didn't tell me that i saw it e and c so this huge piece is coming out

1121
03:22:24,520 --> 03:22:37,079

1125
03:23:05,479 --> 03:23:13,719

1126
03:23:15,299 --> 03:23:30,969
and bad of a streamer he is oh fuck oh no how did i not see this coming and then i like

1142
03:26:59,399 --> 03:27:05,750

1153
03:29:29,559 --> 03:29:35,299

03:29:35,940 --> 03:29:45,829
to top up i missed it somebody said the top five streams that was the wrong place no it wasn't

1171
03:33:24,229 --> 03:33:28,229
because if you can't do john wane you just sound awful trying to do john wane

1172
03:33:28,229 --> 03:33:31,750
and if you can do john wane you sound great there's really no in between

1173
03:33:32,629 --> 03:33:39,030
you sound terrible and really bad and not good at all if you try to do it if you can do it

03:33:40,180 --> 03:33:51,750
you sound great what's the worst possible voice you can do like most grating i don't know i

03:34:08,329 --> 03:34:14,389
air coming out of a horn maybe like an air horn that is barely running out of air

1177
03:34:14,389 --> 03:34:32,700
might be close that's that's as close as i could probably get something like that probably

1178
03:34:39,670 --> 03:34:58,729

1201
03:39:50,040 --> 03:40:01,979
go to sleep and then just and wake up you'll be able to get it that's the only way minus 120

03:47:33,989 --> 03:47:45,899
near future oh god we're getting real intricate here okay so then this moves here and then

1235
03:47:47,750 --> 03:48:02,950
this comes over now what does this go this all right that's really weird remember the

1236
03:48:02,950 --> 03:48:09,590
corbit it actually goes inside the lss2 go ahead and get it ready check the direction

1237
03:48:10,149 --> 03:48:14,549
of the eyelet house if the side where you insert the tab is on the inside then you're all good to

1238
03:48:14,549 --> 03:48:26,440
go it is slide the core along until it comes to rest against the eyelet's house what the fuck

1239
03:48:26,440 --> 03:48:37,420
okay so like this what's a bourbon wine i have no idea kind of tastes good though the rubber

1240
03:48:37,420 --> 03:48:43,540
band hasn't been come loose check quickly to make sure and fix it no it's not oh dear we

1241
03:48:43,620 --> 03:48:48,979
have to fold the whole thing around this like a sandwich i don't look like a piece of sushi

1242
03:48:53,180 --> 03:49:26,659
roll up the sides around the whole thing this goodness this goes under here and go like that

1243
03:49:26,659 --> 03:49:35,340
i'm not supposed to close this up like this there it is there it is there it is there it

1244
03:49:36,059 --> 03:49:49,659
will go back this comes up first slide it there this comes up all the way like that

1245
03:49:51,340 --> 03:50:07,260
and then this side comes up here which leaves this here like that okay and this closes down

1246
03:50:07,260 --> 03:50:24,250
there oh my god all right so how do i connect this together hold them in one place until we

1247
03:50:24,250 --> 03:50:38,899
can secure them see this little flap over here flap yeah fold it up it'll help keep everything in

1248
03:50:38,899 --> 03:50:46,840
place for now really well i just hold it that really did work okay it actually worked

1249
03:50:47,399 --> 03:50:52,889
and then the rubber band comes up and goes over and around the whole thing

1250
03:50:55,799 --> 03:51:19,590
that's it this up and around i think that's good looks like it's all right i don't know

1251
03:51:23,350 --> 03:51:33,530
yeah no it's in there and then we fold this shit up we'll fold up the control pan on x

1252
03:51:33,530 --> 03:51:46,260
first raise up the skinny arms my god this is elaborate and then bring them connect the arms

1253
03:51:46,260 --> 03:52:06,360
by sliding the notch so i'm connecting these like that yeah once that's done lift up the sides

1254
03:52:09,819 --> 03:52:20,739
this holy shit this is crazy it comes up and this folds down and this comes across here

1255
03:52:21,940 --> 03:52:31,700
this is looking like a rocket launcher that's for sure so we have to do more building on

1256
03:52:31,700 --> 03:52:45,850
that then that's over here get this where does this go rubber band should be on the

1257
03:52:45,850 --> 03:52:52,170
other side of the tab isn't it though looks like it is that's not on the other side looks like

1258
03:52:52,170 --> 03:53:01,750
it is that's in the right spot right this thing looks cool yeah lavos are cool they really are

1259
03:53:04,139 --> 03:53:10,899
tabs here it's cool to see it come together regardless of how the game is it's cool to

1260
03:53:10,899 --> 03:53:18,760
make a little device that's cool to make a king's landing it's in front it goes in the front

1261
03:53:22,549 --> 03:53:36,840
all right i got it i got it thank you everybody for giving me the tips that i need that's in the

1262
03:53:36,840 --> 03:53:43,799
front that's good to go right in front so then what does this do it's probably this next bit

1263
03:53:43,799 --> 03:53:52,569
might surprise you lift up the whole thing and align it like so was the arrow arrow

1264
03:53:53,209 --> 03:54:04,920
and it goes in the mark on the end should be the line it is like that and then it goes down

1265
03:54:12,069 --> 03:54:35,860
all the way in god come on come on and oh i see look at that here's the tube this is cool

1266
03:54:36,889 --> 03:54:46,790
nice all right let's stick it up here these tabs go back inside weirdly enough they kind

1267
03:54:46,790 --> 03:54:55,399
of fold back in on themselves this is one and the other one's on this other side

1268
03:54:55,399 --> 03:55:14,489
i can't really get it though there we go done cool now what pull it to the right when you

1269
03:55:14,489 --> 03:55:34,389
let go does it snap back into place that's pretty cool so it's like total shock huh

1270
03:55:36,659 --> 03:55:53,559
how they think of this shit i have no idea the lss is ready for launch all right next part

1271
03:55:53,559 --> 03:55:57,000
well that's the second step complete the front of the toy is now all done why not take a break

1272
03:55:57,799 --> 03:56:12,379
i don't think i need a break making the clacker so we need c and f c and f where's the home

1273
03:56:12,379 --> 03:56:21,750
stretch maybe like another hour and a half maybe like another two hours we need this thing in

1274
03:56:21,750 --> 03:56:40,649
the middle what is a clacker what does that mean clacker let's see do an auto break no

1275
03:56:40,649 --> 03:56:45,209
we're good we're good we're good i want to get this done because once this is done and i play with

1276
03:56:45,209 --> 03:56:50,969
it for five seconds we'll just hang out in the chat for a little while another glass of wine

1277
03:56:50,969 --> 03:56:59,500
we'll go on our merry way you know all right looks good i'm going to move this out of the

1278
03:56:59,500 --> 03:57:09,159
way because i don't think i need it right this second all right a little spaceship here

1279
03:57:09,159 --> 03:57:26,360
let's punch out the necessary things needs to be like that hang out jupiter yeah we'll just

1280
03:57:26,360 --> 03:57:31,610
hang out for a while because i don't have the other they don't sell them together they're all

1281
03:57:31,610 --> 03:57:40,520
sold out i went to gamestop i went to best buy target like i went everywhere nobody has this

1282
03:57:40,520 --> 03:57:46,860
shit you have to buy this on the nintendo official website shop it's not on amazon

1283
03:57:46,860 --> 03:57:52,360
either you can't get the whole kit on amazon right now it's all uh locked out you could

1284
03:57:52,360 --> 03:57:58,329
spend like 110 bucks to get it from some third party but i apparently bought it too late

1285
03:57:59,049 --> 03:58:13,620
but i should end up doing that take that sheet of marker stickers this thing okay

1286
03:58:17,850 --> 03:58:27,590
bend the sheet no i can see it i can see it just fine so the stickers on this part of the

1287
03:58:27,590 --> 03:58:33,610
sheet it's the right in the middle all right i see you can't see but i can that's all the

1288
03:58:33,610 --> 03:58:48,569
matters is that i can see so right here i'm trying to see so hard it's the wrong piece

1289

1291
03:59:22,809 --> 03:59:42,219
i can't bite into this shit it'd be bad news come here come here okay so now right here

1292
03:59:42,219 --> 03:59:51,209
needs to be this big sticker right here the big one large one the biggest one on the sheet

1293
03:59:51,209 --> 04:00:05,139

1294
04:00:05,139 --> 04:00:20,899

1295
04:00:20,899 --> 04:00:54,649
did i fold it all it was on accident though to be fair fold it okay every little piece

1296

1298
04:01:51,100 --> 04:01:56,059
but i went too far i pretended to lick it for the joke and my tongue touched it

1299
04:01:56,940 --> 04:02:11,670
unfortunately it's the truth it went too far not good with depth perception have you seen me

1300
04:02:12,389 --> 04:02:20,200
slap myself in the face before i have done that this folds in these ones go out

1301
04:02:21,159 --> 04:02:26,120
out and out and these come in all the way does it push it does it do the whole thing

1302
04:02:26,760 --> 04:02:35,159
like this i think so lick the table no i'm sorry that's not gonna happen that actually

1303
04:02:35,159 --> 04:02:42,469

1306
04:02:56,329 --> 04:03:11,370

1310
04:03:36,680 --> 04:03:53,719
is it going to be like a probably snap it all in can you see the marker sticker through

1311
04:03:53,719 --> 04:03:59,260
the windows in the hand they look like robot eyes and the opening below is the mouth

1312
04:04:00,059 --> 04:04:09,530
i think you can see them i can can you good only boomers know what a clacker is

1313
04:04:10,250 --> 04:04:18,440
i'm not even i'm a late i'm a late millennial an early millennial not even a boomer i never

1314
04:04:18,440 --> 04:04:29,639
understood that joke okay more more stickers one two these go where right here right on the

1315
04:04:29,639 --> 04:04:45,190
dot i'm not even 38 i turned 39 in fucking september come on guys i turned 37 in august

1316
04:04:45,829 --> 04:05:02,489
okay there we go uh tiny fold lines on each of the robot feet fold them back i did that

1317
04:05:02,489 --> 04:05:12,020
right right you sound like you were raised in the 30s what are you talking about like

1318
04:05:12,020 --> 04:05:22,920
the way that i talk fold them off you sound like you were raised in the sound like you

1319
04:05:22,920 --> 04:05:29,979
were raised in the 30s i don't think i talk like this possible but i don't think i do

1320
04:05:32,549 --> 04:05:39,159
everybody born in the 30s talk like this lots of inflection sort of a weird fake british

1321
04:05:39,159 --> 04:05:44,360
accent but it's not really british it was american 1930s american what even was that

1322
04:05:44,360 --> 04:06:07,129
accent it was like we're still british but we're not quite british anymore transatlantic

1323
04:06:07,129 --> 04:06:24,620
right it's true inflation hit accents hard all right let's get this part done

1324
04:06:31,290 --> 04:06:40,950
whoa all right so these like that wow so how did they have to combine them together

1325
04:06:41,989 --> 04:06:46,309
that was a stuffy nose okay so i have to combine these little hands together

1326
04:06:50,739 --> 04:07:05,579
wow okay then these fold in to make a little right they don't stay down though the next part

1327
04:07:05,579 --> 04:07:12,459
requires some gymnastics take the top of the robot head all the way over and then stick it

1328
04:07:12,459 --> 04:07:29,959
down through here that's pretty cool that's exactly what i just did another one of these

1329
04:07:31,000 --> 04:07:44,739
it goes right in the front right across the whole uh star more wine relax what are you

1330
04:07:44,739 --> 04:07:50,340

1335
04:08:31,780 --> 04:08:39,370
we're done with these for now what did you miss dude you missed so much shit you have no idea

1545
04:48:24,520 --> 04:48:40,380
rumor part of the stream i can't tell i can't see from here hefty amount like 20 minutes

1546
04:48:40,939 --> 04:48:47,369
ah i'm sorry spent longer time one more dumb shit it's okay as long as it wasn't like 40

1547
04:48:48,169 --> 04:48:58,520
it's an interesting looking piece this folds all the way and really really i don't believe

1548
04:48:58,520 --> 04:49:19,849
you i don't wait what hold this down this comes down and then this comes up roll it over

1549
04:49:22,950 --> 04:49:32,009
jesus all right this these two come down i'm getting sleepy stop being so boring

1550
04:49:32,729 --> 04:49:41,779
i was just screaming for like 10 straight minutes i was just i was just making loud

1551
04:49:41,779 --> 04:49:55,159
fucking noises for like 15 straight minutes i was screaming and yelling loud equals funny

1552
04:49:55,159 --> 04:50:00,020
no i wasn't trying to be funny i was trying to make a point it's all right i can't win

1553
04:50:00,740 --> 04:50:27,779
can't win what's next loud equals i'm right got it no that was the culmination of like six

1554
04:50:27,779 --> 04:50:35,380
months of being roomed on and off stream no loud doesn't equal right loud is not funny

1555
04:50:36,020 --> 04:50:50,759
damn it don't think of me like that actually think of everyone what is this what this is

1556
04:50:50,759 --> 04:50:58,840
a tight piece what are the squares on my door uh they are noise dampening devices

1557
04:51:01,770 --> 04:51:08,500
it is noise foam makes it so there's no echo in the room as you notice when i go like hey hey

1558
04:51:08,580 --> 04:51:14,599
hey hey hey uh there's no echo there's a bunch of panels over here there's a couple of bass

1559
04:51:14,599 --> 04:51:24,950
traps in the corners a couple of bass traps in the what's gonna say sink closet it dampens

1560
04:51:24,950 --> 04:51:29,590
the sound in the room so without a bunch of furniture you cannot have a bunch of echo

1561
04:51:33,240 --> 04:51:37,639
don't resident sleeper come on it's what it's it's easy nine ten eleven it's like 12 a.m of

1573
04:53:33,540 --> 04:53:46,779
six to eight i'm not doing a 13 hour stream all right that's all folded good to go all right

1574
04:53:46,779 --> 04:54:01,580
now what what do i do with this read the whole rat movie script i i made it i don't need

1575
04:54:01,580 --> 04:54:11,860
to read it i already know all the lines okay this whole thing rolls up on this side thing rolls

1576
04:54:11,860 --> 04:54:27,619
over that and then it comes across the whole thing it snaps in give us a good night kiss

1579
04:55:00,060 --> 04:55:06,040
thanks for coming up blaster is nearing completion it's pretty interesting it's got like a little

1580
04:55:06,040 --> 04:55:11,799
in the middle so that's cool and this tab folds out and what does the tab do

1581
04:55:13,220 --> 04:55:22,819
hidden opening and stick it in it's that simple apparently all right then this piece

1582
04:55:23,459 --> 04:55:32,729
which is right and left it's got a couple of lines here to fold lick us or you'll never

1583
04:55:32,729 --> 04:55:38,470
see us again that's not true you tell me if i don't lick the camera then you guys won't come

1584
04:55:38,470 --> 04:55:44,659
back i have trouble believing that so all right let's put it all together

1585
04:55:46,700 --> 04:55:59,500
ooh yellow two of them these are thicker than the other ones getting almost to the end of

1586
04:55:59,500 --> 04:56:14,680
the grommets so we're combining these two so this is r and r each bit has a hole in it

1587
04:56:14,680 --> 04:56:18,520
and we want to line those up first make sure that the r mark on each piece is facing

1588
04:56:18,520 --> 04:56:38,619
upward so all it is now r and r right so r and r like that i think i don't know

1589
04:56:43,430 --> 04:56:57,240
that i mean that's correct and then the yellow grommet goes in the middle here

1590
04:56:57,799 --> 04:57:05,639
through all of it or just through the middle there which one so right okay through the

1591
04:57:05,639 --> 04:57:19,619
middle this and then stick this on here click all right same thing in the other one

1592
04:57:21,029 --> 04:57:46,919
whoa shit all right wait so then this then what okay another snap what there already is

1593
04:57:46,919 --> 04:58:00,389

1594
04:58:00,389 --> 04:58:16,250

1595
04:58:18,490 --> 04:58:26,459

1628
05:09:04,200 --> 05:09:11,689
all the way up to the this little slot here and it pushes down well you're fucking going

1629
05:09:11,689 --> 05:09:33,419
too fast that goes down here into these slots but they don't really stand that well

1630
05:09:34,220 --> 05:09:53,240
the whole back comes up over the whole thing and this comes down down down down

a failed prototype for a human labo imprinted with false memories i think it realistically

2123
07:03:47,180 --> 07:03:56,500
explains your labo obsession it's an existential exercise i just think it's it's just so stupid

07:40:38,490 --> 07:40:45,130
and see if i can get that actually to work am i gonna go to evo i will probably go to evo

2337
07:40:45,130 --> 07:40:50,889
because it's in vegas so why wouldn't i right it's kind of it's like fucking right down the

2338
07:40:50,889 --> 07:41:03,139
street go to evo like that shit is right down the street so why would i not go it would be

2339
07:41:03,139 --> 07:41:12,790
kind of it would be stupid if i didn't because it's really interesting stuff but we

2340
07:41:12,790 --> 07:41:19,610
got uh man bear pig thank you for that uh niall orion thank you no meme but how do

2341
07:41:19,610 --> 07:41:29,700
you feel about pet rats rats are incredibly intelligent loving very very awesome animals

2342
07:41:29,700 --> 07:41:42,950
like rats are highly intelligent adorable fun cuddly loving the creatures yeah i love rats

2343

garfield the bunday killer haven't seen you in a while hi garfield garfield the bunday killer

2344
07:41:48,709 --> 07:41:54,919
250 i was thinking about tf2 again germa it's a crying shame what valves do into that game

2345
07:41:55,720 --> 07:42:03,830
the last good thing added was naming the scout after you uh i don't know if that's real though

2346
07:42:03,830 --> 07:42:08,950
i mean i think that's that might just be just be a coincidence if it's not then like i said

2347
07:42:08,950 --> 07:42:14,709
i've made a statement about it before that's incredibly fucking wonderful that i could even

2348
07:42:14,709 --> 07:42:21,290
imagine anyone would ever do that it's probably just a coincidence but that community is

2349
07:42:23,779 --> 07:42:30,569
unfucking believable so uh but what are you gonna say the last good thing added was

2350
07:42:30,569 --> 07:42:34,569
naming the scout after you i know everyone compares you to the scout but what class is

2351
07:42:34,569 --> 07:42:40,220
your favorite in terms of personality regardless of gameplay the spy i got tf2 after seeing your

2352
07:42:40,220 --> 07:42:45,819
fat guy enji vid it's the first vid i saw of yours garf's been a fan for over four years

2353
07:42:45,819 --> 07:42:52,340
you want to be in shrek 2 garf got hired for independent retailing of shrek 2 phil is in it

2354
07:42:52,979 --> 07:43:01,270
phil lord is in it garf goo i don't think i want to be in shrek 2 uh the spy is my

2355
07:43:01,270 --> 07:43:05,590
favorite character in that game just personality wise i think he's really fun and interesting

2356
07:43:06,220 --> 07:43:16,790
and who who couldn't love the heavy the heavy is just a lovable amazing character so uh but

2357
07:43:16,790 --> 07:43:27,380
yeah i mean that tf2 is would i be sitting here right now talking to you guys if i didn't play

2358
07:43:27,380 --> 07:43:34,729
team fortress and make all those videos no probably not so team fortress was a very real

2359
07:43:34,729 --> 07:43:41,750
start of everything i was doing so i i mean i played that game for years it was one of

2360
07:43:41,750 --> 07:43:49,060
it was like the biggest part of it was a huge part of my life so i owe a lot to that community

2361
07:43:49,060 --> 07:43:54,439
i know i owe a lot to team fortress and valve for even making the game in the first place so

2362
07:43:57,290 --> 07:44:04,950
i owe a lot to that community they propped me up really fucking high they did so i have

2363
07:44:04,950 --> 07:44:15,540
nothing but love for that community at all nothing at all but love and finally we have
