00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:15,449
Hey guys, how are you? Resident sleeper. Resident sleeper. I'm so highly trying to get up. I'm

2
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:23,460
trying to wake up. You know when you're like, yeah. And you do like, with aftershave. In fact,

3
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:32,500
I did that already. Didn't work. You know what I'm talking about? You put aftershave in your hands,

4
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:39,560
and you rub it together, and you go. Nobody has ever done that before. It's in every movie,

5
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:46,759
with like a kid that learns how to shave. That doesn't happen. I didn't even use aftershave,

6
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:58,259
until I was like 30. Anyways. Hi, how are you? How you doing? Hold on, let me move this for a

7
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:14,810
second. Somebody just said, okay, buddy. Okay, buddy. Why is my mic in the wrong spot every time?

8
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:36,920
I don't understand. Hold on, let me move this. Okay. I got my controller. I'm ready to go. Sorry,

9
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:44,859
I am about 40 minutes late. I woke up 55 minutes ago. I was up all night last night,

10
00:01:46,459 --> 00:01:53,700
for a bunch of different reasons. I've been very, very excited. Maybe, if I'm honest,

11
00:01:53,700 --> 00:02:02,359
maybe a little overwhelmed by some things. Don't call me a 3k, Andy. Just wait 10 minutes. Sorry,

12
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:06,680
like when people talk about my low view count, it automatically just triggers a fucking rage

13
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:17,960
response. Sorry, let's continue. Yeah, I was up all night last night and I'll be real with you.

14
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:26,629
There's a lot going on. God damn it. I'm trying to be real and I do a fucking voice crack and

15
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:37,430
everyone's gonna laugh at it. Without getting into details, there's a lot of stuff going on

16
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:44,139
behind the scenes in my life right now. All very, very wonderful things. Wonderful things.

17
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:51,219
Not, I'm not talking about just, oh, he's talking about like projects. There's a lot of great things

18
00:02:51,219 --> 00:03:00,250
going on. Some that I'll talk about soon, probably. But I'm getting, I'm getting kind

19
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:05,539
of overwhelmed. There's so many fucking cool things. And then I get up yesterday, or the day

20
00:03:05,539 --> 00:03:10,979
before, and I see that I'm like on the front page of all of Reddit with like 50,000 uploads,

21
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:18,900
the serial killer image. And like everybody thinks of a serial killer. And I gotta tell you,

22
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:27,610
I gotta be careful with my next wish from the chat genie. Because, oh please, please, please,

23
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:31,930
oh please, oh chat genie, please make the stupid face go away that I don't like.

24
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:38,360
The monkey pot curls, there it is. There's the among us face, right? Oh please, please chat genie,

25
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:44,280
please make the among us face go away. I don't like the sus guy. Okay, fine. You're every serial

26
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:52,169
killer that's ever been combined together in an AI image. I am, I am not gonna use my third chat

27
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:58,729
genie wish on anything else. And I thought about this in the shower. I was like, you know, all

28
00:03:58,729 --> 00:04:05,259
right, what if I like wish for world like hunger to be over, right? Somehow the monkey pot would

29
00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:12,520
curl. And so we would all fucking die. And like the aliens would come get us, like and eat our

30
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:17,160
like fucking the soil in the ground. I'm not making any more fucking wishes. Never again.

31
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:24,279
Like aliens would find this planet a million years from now and the soil would be fucking so

32
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:40,730
good. It would solve their alien world hunger. Nope. No more wishes. Zero. What was he talking

33
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:51,050
about? I'm talking about serial killer AI image. I was on the toilet. I'm not, I was taking a

34
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:55,939
going to the bathroom on the second number and I'm scrolling down. I didn't know it was there.

35
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:01,899
It's the second time it was there in the month. I'm sitting there. I'm going to the bathroom. I'm

36
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:07,980
scrolling down and I just see my like, my like arrest picture. It has like 30 something thousand

37
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:20,620
upvotes on the front page. I audibly gasped. It was like, that's how I found out it was there.

38
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:37,029
I'm not wishing for anything else. Never again. Never again. This guy's ego is out of hand.

39
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,329
No more wishes. I'm never asking for anything ever again.

40
00:05:47,129 --> 00:06:03,430
Why did you wish to be a serial killer? I didn't. Yes, you did. I know I didn't. What are you

41
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:18,970
talking about? You just wished for the sus face to come back. No, I did not. Do you wish to be sus?

42
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:25,449
And I don't know, weirdly enough, me saying this, me like talking about this and being like,

43
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:30,620
holy shit, I don't know if I like that one. So it's, there's going to be like a combination.

44
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:40,199
Nope. Don't say it. Don't say it. I'm not going to, I'm done. All right. Let's play Saints Row 2.

45
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:54,120
Hi guys. Welcome to the stream. Nope. No. Okay. Saints Row 2 coming up here. We're going to go

46
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,990
right where we left off, which should be, I don't know what we like 5% of the way through the game.

47
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:16,629
Does it matter which one we pick? Probably this one, right? Yeah. But it's, it's been, it's been a

48
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:26,329
while, a few weeks, few months. I'm very, very excited. I can't wait for all this stuff. I've

49
00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:31,560
been, I was up all night. I couldn't go to sleep. I forgot this is what the character looked like.

50
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:43,589
All right. What are the buttons again? All right. Oh shit. Okay. So we do a mission. No, let me,

51
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:55,180
let me get, let me get my bearings. Hold on. Let's sprint. Let's throw. Okay.

52
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:11,819
What are you saying? Hold on. Somebody, somebody wrote something. They were very concerned about

53
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:17,240
me. Hold on. Remember what started out as a joke has escalated over the last few weeks

54
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,480
of something concerning. A friend of mine began watching you at a friend's recommendation sheet.

55
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:32,299
All right. I'm not gonna, nevermind. Oh, did the game crash? No, it didn't. Webcam or naked?

56
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:51,590
The second one. I didn't mean to shoot. All right. Let's go to, I forgot how fun this game was.

57
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:11,299
A welcome to the stream, everybody. I've got my coffee here. Let me take a sip. All right. So

58
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:23,940
let's take a look at the map. I could do this Ronan mission. I could go get some food. Oh,

59
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:38,470
15% off sale. Let's go. You know when you get up and you realize that you're supposed to be somewhere

60
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:44,070
and you have, your body's in slow motion, your brain is in slow motion too.

61
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:59,240
And you always wake up and you go, ah, everybody does that. Ah, and then you have to like close

62
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:15,379
one eye and like blink them a bunch of times because your eyes aren't ready. Yeah, that happened.

63
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:23,269
All right. What we got? Put the gun away, please. Put the gun away. Whoa, wait a minute. Once you

64
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:28,070
own a hood, you can buy a share of each business in that hood. Owning a share of the business will

65
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:38,409
give you a discount on their items. I can own this place? 5,000 bucks. Did I get it? I got it.

66
00:10:39,049 --> 00:10:45,700
You now get a piece of the action of the store and we'll see $200 a day.

67
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:51,559
What the fuck is this guy doing? I'm in the middle of a cut scene, dude. Leave me alone.

68
00:10:52,279 --> 00:11:17,879
They're coming back. No, they're not. Okay, so what is happening out here? Why am I this person now?

69
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:34,980
I just became this person. What? What's going on? Okay, I got absorbed. So I get a discount here

70
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:45,690
now. Yeah, we need some new clothes for sure. I gotta not be the Happy Wheels character. All right,

71
00:11:45,690 --> 00:12:16,950
hats. What do we got? How about the 3D movie maker hat? Okay, I like these. Okay, shirts. Nothing

72
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:24,419
looks correct on this character. Why is it screaming outside? What the fuck is happening?

73
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:52,679
That one just looks like skin. Okay, over shirts. Coats. Denim vest. Fear and loathing in McDonald's.

74
00:12:52,679 --> 00:13:04,600
That's pretty good. Get the swords. Does it come with the swords? You're just a tent.

75
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:38,889
What about lower? I need different pants. God. Why am I- whatever. Why am I T-posing? What the fuck?

76
00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:44,259
Shit, I forgot about that. Somebody said the outfits crash the game no matter what.

77
00:13:44,259 --> 00:13:51,750
I- whatever. I gotta go buy that place again. Fuck, come on. All right, I'm never touching

78
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:56,549
outfits. I forgot about that. If you touch- if you look at an outfit, if an outfit gets previewed,

79
00:13:56,549 --> 00:14:17,000
it crashes the game every single time no matter what. Okay. Well, should I- maybe should I save

80
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:27,559
my money? Or should I not buy that place? A bunch of people saying go to the mall. Where's the mall?

81
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:40,860
Up here? All right, there's a mission over here, which I'll do that. It says mall on the map. It

82
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:52,860
does. I end retail district. Boardwalk. The beach. No, I'm not going to the casino right now. No.

83
00:14:52,860 --> 00:15:03,320
It says mall. Yeah, but I- okay. Yeah, it says mall, but it's covered up by like a flag. There it is.

84
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:16,889
Okay, mall. Go that way. You can take a motorcycle into the mall. Oh shit, we're definitely doing

85
00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:30,299
that. There's a funny costume store? Okay. I think I'm gonna take like the hamburger mobile.

86
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:59,059
Does this do- can I like- no, it just looks cool. Oh, it- oh, dude, Rick. All right, going to the mall.

87
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:03,220
And then I'm gonna- after that, I'm gonna do the Ronin mission that's right there, because everyone

88
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:20,710
said do the Ronin missions. They're the best. A crush lizard. Thanks for the 20 community subs.

89
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:42,309
Would you eat a hamburger with a fork? No. I'm not- I'm not a twisted, twisted fuck. What about pizza?

90
00:16:42,309 --> 00:16:54,220
Depends on the kind of pizza. A really sloppy soup pizza? Yeah, maybe. Sometimes you have to. All

91
00:16:54,220 --> 00:17:03,539
right, so this is mall? Cool. All right, so what's- where's the mall? What's this? Enter the

92
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:18,200
Altord Depot shopping mall. Oh shit, okay. So we're in- now here we are. I was watching.

93
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:22,279
What was the problem? What was the matter? I was watching him do that. Okay, that was-

94
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:31,990
that was aggressive. It was. I'm not gonna- that was aggressive. I bumped him. Wait, this roller

95
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:46,730
skating? How come I can't- I have roller skates on right now. Can I do that? Oh, cool. Mall is- oh,

96
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:52,279
I almost just took that lady out. All right, so where's the- oh, there we go. I want to go over

97
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:58,859
there. So we gotta go take a right. Go down this way. It's over there. Does this hurt if I do this?

98
00:17:58,859 --> 00:18:18,390
Can I jump over this? The auto show? Cool. Yeah, all right, so we gotta go across. There are three

99
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:31,480
stores in the mall that sell unique clothes. Oh, cool. I always feel weird when I do this in a mall.

100
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:38,980
Anybody else relate to this? Sitting down in one of these benches and one of these sofas at the mall

101
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:42,579
it almost to me internally feels like I'm not supposed to be here. I'm not supposed to be in

102
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:48,119
the mall. I don't know why I have this thing in my brain where like if you're at a mall you need to

103
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:51,480
be walking around and like shopping and looking at stuff. I feel like sitting down it's almost

104
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:59,589
like what am I- why am I here? It feels weird. I feel like people are walking by and judging me.

105
00:18:59,589 --> 00:19:05,210
Like, you're not buying anything. You're just sitting down in the bench and the only way that

106
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:10,500
you get a pass doing that is if you're holding an ice cream. Oh, okay, you've got an ice cream.

107
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,150
You're shopping here, aren't you? You're like hanging- okay, you've got an ice cream. You're

108
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:27,769
fine. I don't know why I feel like that. Oh, like a pretzel. Yeah. Oh, like you- oh, you've got a big

109
00:19:27,769 --> 00:19:43,299
pretzel. I do not go to outfits with the love of god. You're nuts. Okay, what do we got? The bike

110
00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:58,630
helmet, the cap, dirt bike helmet. Why does this have a respirator? Should I get that one with a

111
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:16,069
respirator? I want to be able to see his face though. I like- I like his- I want to see his face.

112
00:20:16,069 --> 00:20:34,410
I want this one. Solid silk shirt. Oh, okay. Wait, maybe. I'll come back to it. Oh, these swishy

113
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:46,200
pants? I loved swishy pants when I was younger. Guys, every single middle school in America,

114
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:51,079
if you just sit there and listen in the hallway, it just sounds like this.

115
00:20:55,619 --> 00:21:14,569
All the fucking kids walking around with these swishy pants on. I kind of want the blood vial.

116
00:21:14,569 --> 00:21:24,339
You can't even see it. I'm too big. I forget without the hat. I gotta take the hat off.

117
00:21:24,339 --> 00:21:31,099
It's so much better without the hat on. It's so much better. A million times better.

118
00:21:38,019 --> 00:21:46,950
I have to take- that just hurt. Okay, hold on. I take off the hat. How do I take- how do I get no

119
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:58,660
hat? Can I? I think I have to go to my wardrobe, right? Don't touch outfits. How do I skip outfits?

120
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:14,410
Okay, miscellaneous. Wallet chain? No. No tattoos. No, all right. Let's get out of here.

121
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:27,339
Do suits count as outfits? I'm terrified to go look at it. I think so, yeah. No. Hmm. Suits

122
00:22:27,339 --> 00:22:41,700
are fine. Are you sure? Yes, they do. All right, where else can we go? Over here. I want to go

123
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:58,329
this way. We gotta go downstairs. That'd be so fucked up if you saw that. Is it all the way

124
00:22:58,329 --> 00:23:15,779
down or is it just right here? Wait, is this a weapons store, Hoover? This is a weapons store.

125
00:23:15,779 --> 00:23:24,789
I had to get it out of my system by punching the air first. Whoa, there's different stuff in here.

126
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:33,140
Oh, shit. All right, here we go. What do you got? I already have that. SMGs, shotguns, rifles,

127
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:51,910
special, throne. No, you don't have anything new. Get out of here. What the fuck? What? Increase

128
00:23:51,910 --> 00:24:03,299
elevation. Decrease elevation. Rotate the helicopter. Why am I in this? Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out!

129
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:21,130
Get out! I'm trapped! I'm trapped! Holy shit, you don't even care. Can I flip it? I can't flip it.

130
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:34,380
No, it's over. I've ruined it. No, I ruined it. What the hell? Whatever. That's why you wanted me

131
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:39,420
to come here and it's been like 10 straight minutes of buildup of you telling me to go to the mall

132
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:53,210
for me to flip it in less than two seconds. Just reload the save. What? What did you say? Who said

133
00:24:53,210 --> 00:25:04,259
that? I want to see what the other store is though. I can't reload. It's not even gonna put me in the

134
00:25:04,259 --> 00:25:20,970
mall. You guys are shit crazy. Watch this. More can spawn. Okay, cool. Okay, I'll just come back.

135
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:33,609
Reload the gun, not the save. Wait, I'm going the wrong way. Where is this place? Down here. Okay.

136
00:25:33,609 --> 00:25:48,119
Why am I so- I'm so out of breath every second. Hurry up. I watched Ernest's Scared Stupid and

137
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:54,299
it sucked. Get out of here. You don't even know anything about movies. What do you know about

138
00:25:54,299 --> 00:26:09,720
movies? All right, I'm sorry. Ernest- the Ernest franchise is better than the entire phase four of

139
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:23,930
Marvel. I'm just gonna be honest. What happened? What? Like the Ernest cinematic universe phase

140
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:27,960
one I think is better than the Marvel cinematic universe phase four. I think- I think that's not

141
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:41,369
like an unpopular opinion. How do I get rid of this guy? Oh, I'm on the wrong side.

142
00:26:41,369 --> 00:26:54,470
All right, just beat this guy up. Doesn't everybody care that I did this? I don't think so. All right,

143
00:26:54,470 --> 00:27:20,839
hurry up. Let's go. The Eternals Scared Stupid. What do you think is gonna happen with Marvel?

144
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:36,039
Do you think there's gonna be a phase five? Like phase six? I don't know. I wonder. Oh my god. I

145
00:27:36,039 --> 00:28:01,529
don't want to go too fast. I don't want to attract attention. I don't want to attract attention so I

146
00:28:01,529 --> 00:28:21,500
gotta go slow. Oops. Okay, this way. How are you still alive? I just hit you with a fucking sludge

147
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:26,569
hammer. What? No, I don't want to shoot- I didn't even shoot him. The game did that on its own.

148
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:31,210
The game, I swear to god, did that on its own. I didn't press any buttons. I didn't- that was

149
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:42,230
his decision, not mine. I didn't press that. I swear to god. I didn't press anything. A chainsaw?

150
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:49,799
Oh my goodness gracious. All right, I'm sorry but how do you advertise a chainsaw but not have it

151
00:28:49,799 --> 00:29:12,779
in st- in- in- in store? Where's the chainsaw? Look at the- you have so many in stock. What the

152
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:26,859
fuck? How do you not- get away from me. How do you not have that in stock? That's annoying.

153
00:29:26,859 --> 00:29:35,529
I didn't even steal anything. Why did that alarm go off? I didn't take anything out of the store.

154
00:29:37,289 --> 00:30:00,009
What the fuck is that thing? I'm so sorry I didn't mean to. So stupid. Take the AT- I want the UFO.

155
00:30:00,009 --> 00:30:10,619
Is it back- is it spawned again? I'll take- I'll take a couple of donut holes. I'll take- I'll take a

156
00:30:10,619 --> 00:30:34,680
donut. How do I get out of this without a problem? Get out. Leave me alone. Give me one of the little

157
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:41,299
security wagons. What are you doing? Get in the security wagon. It's smaller. It's tighter. It's

158
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:46,019
easy- it's like easier to like maneuver. You got tighter handling. Stop! Oh my god. I'm gonna fucking

159
00:30:46,019 --> 00:31:04,500
flip out. I'm sorry. I'm gonna- leave me alone. All right, I went to the mall and then nothing

160
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:21,990
happened. I just wasted 20 minutes. I want to do a mission. Go back please. Wait, can I take the UFO

161
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:37,160
out of the mall? Oh this is- Misty Lane is under attack. What? What do you mean it's under attack?

162
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:42,970
By who? Oh my god. Wait a minute. This must- I think this might be an Avengers level threat.

163
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:57,460
I gotta go protect- I gotta go protect my home. I want to play the Avengers theme song,

164
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:10,779
but I feel like that would be like- I would- they'd come after me somehow. Play the Ernest theme song.

165
00:32:11,339 --> 00:32:19,609
I don't think he even had a- I don't think he had a theme song. Hey Vern, I'm coming

166
00:32:19,609 --> 00:32:28,180
Ernest B Warl to save everybody down here. Now Vern, I have a sledgehammer. I'm gonna cock it back

167
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:46,680
behind my back and swing where the fences burn. This is an Ernest level threat. Oh shit,

168
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:57,430
we've got an Ernest level threat here. That's so stupid. During a pushback, an enemy gang is trying

169
00:32:57,430 --> 00:33:04,779
to reclaim their neighborhood. Contested neighborhood will be flashing on the city map.

170
00:33:04,779 --> 00:33:08,140
Okay. In order to retake the contested area, you must enter the neighborhood and kill the

171
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:12,700
enemy lieutenants. Until you do, you- you will earn no money for controlling that neighborhood.

172
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:32,200
Oh shit, that's actually a big deal. All right, I gotta- I gotta do this. Oh no, what about the

173
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:42,660
caterers? Hey Vern, this car- I can't even turn this car. This car is handling. I can't turn it.

174
00:33:48,019 --> 00:33:55,829
Wait, I have like a bazooka. I might as well use it. Where is he? Right there? What's alt fire?

175
00:33:55,829 --> 00:34:26,039
What's alt fire? How do I use- what is right click? Am I- is this working? Can I not go through the

176
00:34:26,039 --> 00:35:01,420
fence? Oh shit! Got it. Got it. Oh my god, that's so far away. Stop! Like, whoa! Eat, eat, eat! I have

177
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:11,340
like fucking cheeseburgers. Eat as many as I can. All right, somebody just gave me a wedgie. That

178
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:33,210
was- that was the sound I just made. All right, that lieutenant's gone. All right, we gotta go.

179
00:35:33,210 --> 00:36:00,059
Is there a time limit? Why am I running here? I need to get a car. Hey, get in. Get in the car.

180
00:36:00,059 --> 00:36:14,869
I wanna- I want someone to come with me. What the fuck? Oh my god. I'm sorry. Shit. There's two

181
00:36:14,869 --> 00:36:25,579
lieutenants over here by the gas station or whatever this is. Stop. Stop it. Oh my goodness,

182
00:36:25,579 --> 00:36:36,500
he's trying to pull me out. There's so many of these sandwiched men. Holy shit. I have to throw

183
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:58,489
a grenade or something. Do I have any grenades? How do I not have grenades? Did they get it? Not

184
00:36:58,489 --> 00:37:07,960
yet. Get back over there. Turn the sound up. Yeah, I'll turn the audio up on the game. Game audio's

185
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:18,440
going up. I need to- no. I need ammo first. Because honestly, these weapons are not loaded

186
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:39,590
very well. This game is too hard for you. No, it's not. The game is perfectly fine. Put on Christmas

187
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:52,710
music now. I love the Ernest level threat. That's like my favorite thing so far today.

188
00:37:53,349 --> 00:38:11,579
I feel like my- ugh. Okay. Take this out. I have to go- I have money that I've collected, don't I?

189
00:38:12,469 --> 00:38:20,460
The stash somewhere? Please move. Why are you suddenly Ernest's number one fan?

190
00:38:21,179 --> 00:38:25,190
I don't think that's suddenly. I think I made it pretty clear over the years that

191
00:38:26,389 --> 00:38:38,780
Ernest is like one of the most talented showmen. One thing that I'm really afraid of is them doing

192
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:43,420
like a young Ernest, right? Like, I don't want them to make another Ernest movie. Don't replace

193
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:47,739
Ernest. Don't make a new Ernest, right? Don't do that. There's real a lot of potential for that

194
00:38:47,739 --> 00:38:51,900
to happen. I feel the same way about Gumby. Don't do Gumby again. They're gonna do it. I hope they

195
00:38:51,900 --> 00:39:10,230
don't. They upstairs? Fuck. I need a flashbang or something. Don't I have flashbangs? I bought

196
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:27,139
like three of them. How much bullet- this is one bullet? Shoot the gun! I'm not ready for this one.

197
00:39:27,139 --> 00:39:50,949
This is too much. What was that? There's still- no, they're already killed. Okay, good. There's

198
00:39:50,949 --> 00:40:01,239
one more person upstairs. Maybe not. Where are you? Are you down? Did I run by this person?

199
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:16,469
How did I- all right, we're good. Move. Can I get one of these? Save. Holy shit. Thank you so much.

200
00:40:16,469 --> 00:40:20,730
That would have been a disaster. I would have quit. I would have literally quit streaming right

201
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:46,099
there. Who the fuck are you? I need a car, of course. Give me this car. I picked the word- I

202
00:40:46,099 --> 00:40:54,659
picked the car. The only- this car is so old. Give me that bike. That's what I want. I can shoot off

203
00:40:54,659 --> 00:41:08,119
the bike. Go. I fucking hate- I'm quitting. I'm done streaming. Been a good run. It's over. I'm

204
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:19,610
done. Get off of me. I have to stay on the bike. Jesus, what the fuck? How come I don't have any

205
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:26,500
people here defending this with me? Why is it just Ernest? I understand that this is like my movie,

206
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:32,500
and- oh, where's- where's Dr. Strain? He's off world. Oh, what about Captain Marvel? Oh,

207
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:35,300
out of galaxy. But like seriously, where the fuck are they? Where are the other revengers?

208
00:41:36,659 --> 00:41:51,829
Get off of me! Get in! Is that the lieutenant? Oh, I got him. I didn't. Where is this person?

209
00:41:52,710 --> 00:42:17,349
I'm- are they inside? That's it? Now I'm stuck in here. I'm in- I'm in so much trouble.

210
00:42:17,349 --> 00:42:26,710
All the- you can call your gang in the pause menu. Oh god, well, I'm gonna need them. Activities?

211
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:40,900
Hitman? No. Diversions? Where is it? Ernest starts a gang war. The phone? Where's my phone?

212
00:42:41,780 --> 00:43:05,500
How do I get the phone? It's tab? What's that on controller? Select? It's in the menu. Oh,

213
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:17,030
fuck. Okay. All right. Phone. I need, uh, okay, homies. Call. I don't have any friends. Who do I

214
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:31,380
call? Do I call the police? Does that work? No, I don't want- I'm doing- I'm bad. I'm doing bad

215
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:59,239
things. I want a different gun. I think I cleared it out. All right, we're good. I need to make some

216
00:43:59,239 --> 00:44:12,460
friends. Hey, there's a friend. Help me. Oh, this one sucked. I gotta hide somewhere. I'm gonna put

217
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:20,739
the car up right here and then hide behind it as cover. This is such a bad idea, isn't it?

218
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:57,670
That was gonna be so cool, but I missed every shot after that. Fuck. Oh, look at how many people

219
00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:03,900
are here. How am I supposed to do this on my own? Is there anything back here I can use? Look at

220
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:34,360
the trail. How do you hit that fence? Oh no. Eat something. Eat something quick. Oh my fucking

221
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:52,840
god, dude. Give me a break. I'm about to drive up there. Fuck. There's too many. They're just

222
00:45:52,840 --> 00:46:09,820
appearing now. Get in the car. Get in the- Please. Don't. Eat something quick. How am I supposed- I

223
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:16,809
don't understand how I'm gonna do this. They don't stop. There's more gang members right here than

224
00:46:16,809 --> 00:46:24,170
there are people that live in this whole city. They keep coming. Did I get them? I got everybody.

225
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:48,780
Go. Please. Yeah, nice shot. You got them. Don't. You. They're relentless. They're relentless.

226
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:54,139
They're relentless. They're relentless. I can't get away from them. They're relentless.

227
00:46:55,880 --> 00:47:08,199
I can't stop this. That was ridiculous. They were glued to my bumper.

228
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:15,820
Actually glued to the bumper and I have to go back and do this again? Oh, I'm going- No,

229
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:19,980
get weapons first. I keep losing money. All right, snap this person's neck because I'm pissed right

230
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:43,079
now. Okay, I want weapons. Give me weapons. I'm not going over there with the double magnum. It's not

231
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:49,909
gonna happen. Which way- Which store has good weapons? Uh, I don't- Brass Knuckles is good.

232
00:47:49,909 --> 00:47:54,920
I think there's one here too, isn't there? Let's find out. Oh, do the Fight Club. Don't worry. I've

233
00:47:54,920 --> 00:48:26,630
got- We got plenty of time. Oh, do insurance fraud? Maybe in a little bit. Just load the save.

234
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:30,070
I guess that would give me $17,000, but I have to sleep in the bed that I made, don't I?

235
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:39,559
I can't just- I gotta live with this. Somebody said if I do this- Let me see. Does this work?

236
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:53,099
Oh, hell yeah. Finally. How many can I have? All right, I got- I've got one member. Finally.

237
00:48:53,099 --> 00:49:10,500
Let's go get some weapons. Clothing. Is this a weapons store? I have to reveal these on the map.

238
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:33,130
Let's see. No. All right, is this a weapons store? I don't- That one's melee. Name him? Uh,

239
00:49:36,179 --> 00:49:54,090
double barrel. That's lame. What? You don't- I don't care. Is this a weapons store?

240
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:26,300
Does he use a shotgun? No, he's non-violent. All right, it's right here. Get rid of that

241
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:37,219
sussy shotgun. That shotgun really is awful. Okay, that's not it. Is there- Where is the

242
00:50:37,219 --> 00:50:48,820
other weapons stores up here? There's only one? What the hell? I'm just gonna keep looking for one.

243
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:59,559
One of the mall? I guess that's right, but I don't want to go in the mall. Why did I say it like that?

244
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:21,369
Okay. I think it'd be fun to ride on a motorcycle with somebody. Am I getting more respect because

245
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:46,340
somebody's watching me do this? Oh, that's not one. Clothing store and- God damn. Shit. I guess I'm

246
00:51:46,340 --> 00:52:13,539
gonna have to go to the mall. This is one over here, right? Stop cursing? Okay. All right,

247
00:52:13,539 --> 00:52:25,079
every time I- No, I'm not doing that. That'd be fun though. I thought this game was about boating.

248
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:33,900
I was gonna name the stream Row Row Row Ya Boat, but that was probably not very good,

249
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:37,579
and it's probably wouldn't have been that funny. So I just said serving up some fresh games.

250
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:41,980
My voice is gone already. I didn't even do anything because I just woke up.

251
00:52:50,869 --> 00:52:57,769
A hamburger joint. We're gonna just go to the mall. We're gonna wrap around to it already.

252
00:52:57,769 --> 00:53:05,769
It's inevitable that we're gonna go there. It's 3 30 p.m. and you just woke up. Well, I woke up at

253
00:53:05,769 --> 00:53:30,420
like 1 40. I was up all night. A Tesla? What is this place? Oh, it's Tattoos. Okay. I thought

254
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:54,420
it was a Tesla logo. There we go. That's what I want. Let's go. Please. Please.

255
00:53:55,219 --> 00:54:07,369
Thanks. I love that. Please bring that back. It makes me look tough. Don't crash.

256
00:54:08,409 --> 00:54:16,219
It didn't even crash. He's dead. I didn't. That was barely a crash, right? That was nothing.

257
00:54:17,019 --> 00:54:30,010
Oh my God. That was nothing. I wasn't even going. That was going two miles per hour. Why would we

258
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:52,039
fly off like that? There's a diamond. Okay. It's the mall. Let's go. Wait, I have to see if he can

259
00:54:52,039 --> 00:55:00,739
hit his head on this. Does that be funny? Okay. So, I drive straight from here. I wonder if I can

260
00:55:00,739 --> 00:55:20,619
like take his head off. Okay. Ready? It needs to be right here. I mean, he scraped his head, but not

261
00:55:20,619 --> 00:55:29,610
really. Where's the entrance? Right here? Mall entrance. No, that's like a front door. Where is

262
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:50,139
it? This thing goes too fast. Just go in? Yeah, there's a front door to this. I can't just go in?

263
00:55:50,940 --> 00:56:14,949
I think it's up. Where's the entrance? There was a huge sign for mall entrance and you didn't go

264
00:56:14,949 --> 00:56:21,829
in it. I can't even. All right. I'm fucking seriously considering fucking just abandoning

265
00:56:21,829 --> 00:56:26,550
that area and who cares? I don't care if we lose it. It's like a hundred dollars a day. I'm going

266
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:34,760
to go do a mission. It's right here. We're doing a mission. I need like seven people to be in a car

267
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:51,980
with me. I'm just going to go do a mission. Mall entrance is beneath you. You can't lose areas. Oh,

268
00:56:51,980 --> 00:57:06,460
well they made it seem like there was like time limit. I need this more than you. Oh no, double

269
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:15,289
barrels gone. Oh shit, that's right. Poor double barrel. He didn't last five minutes. All right,

270
00:57:15,289 --> 00:57:36,179
let's do a mission. So check it out. You're looking at the old toy institute for science

271
00:57:36,179 --> 00:57:40,900
and innovation, but the place isn't all Jacob's ladder and irrigation shit. In the center of it

272
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:46,579
all is a bunch of servers that run the Ronin's web porn ring. Those assholes are making serious

273
00:57:46,739 --> 00:57:51,380
bank off their sites. So if you can take those bad boys out, the Ronin are definitely gonna be

274
00:57:51,380 --> 00:58:03,559
hurting. So I gotta take out the porn servers. Yeah, I don't think I don't know about about this

275
00:58:03,559 --> 00:58:08,940
one. Maybe we should attack one of their other site or one of their other zones. I don't think

276
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:20,659
this is gonna do very much. I don't I think we should hit him somewhere else. I don't have any

277
00:58:20,659 --> 00:58:37,829
weapons. This is an airplane. I don't have any food either. And of course, of course, you're just

278
00:58:37,829 --> 00:58:53,210
gonna show I have to take your guns. Give me their weapons. The weapons are better. They're faster.

279
00:58:55,989 --> 00:58:58,469
That's oh my god. Why did I not do that in the first place? You kidding me?

280
00:58:59,659 --> 00:59:02,780
No, put that person down. Put that person down. I'm not gonna shoot that person.

281
00:59:07,139 --> 00:59:19,820
Get out. Revive, please. This person is walking around with a newspaper. What are you doing, man?

282
00:59:32,170 --> 00:59:36,980
Good. All right. I thought that was a bad guy. I thought sorry. I'm really sorry. I'm really

283
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:41,110
sorry. I'm really sorry. But what I get out of here. I didn't I thought that was a bad guy. I

284
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:47,940
really did. He had like he had like a shirt on. All right. Can I order food from this? I can.

285
00:59:47,940 --> 01:00:10,380
Where did you come from? Show that guy because he's wearing a shirt. No, I he ran he ran at me.

286
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:31,190
Okay, we're good. What the fuck was that? What's going on down there? You see the indicator?

287
01:00:31,750 --> 01:01:00,840
Is somebody in here with a bike? All right, where's that server? This way. Oh, what is going on?

288
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:16,039
Look at the mini map. What the fuck is that? I need to see. There's nothing there. It's

289
01:01:16,039 --> 01:01:33,909
cars beneath you. Oh, but I thought it was a helicopter, too. Yeah. I didn't mean to shoot

290
01:01:33,909 --> 01:01:41,349
that guy, but whatever. He's all right. Destroy the servers. That's not a server. That was a gas

291
01:01:41,349 --> 01:01:57,780
tank. I thought it was a server. All right, here we go. They don't know you can shoot through glass.

292
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:14,579
Not this class. I just alerted all of them. All right, we got a bunch of up here. Hey,

293
01:02:14,579 --> 01:02:28,619
leave me alone. This is the standoff. Open it. Open the door. Open it. I dare you. I dare you

294
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:40,260
to open this door. Go on. You won't do it. Can they not open? I can't get hit. Let's hit.

295
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:53,239
Imagine you're in the middle of a gigantic action shootout and you're the guy that dies

296
01:02:53,239 --> 01:03:14,389
by getting hit in the face by an empty recycling bin. I don't know what that was, but whatever.

297
01:03:24,739 --> 01:03:34,019
No, not the porn. All right, I gotta get out. Head for the doors. I'm out of bullets. Hold on.

298
01:03:34,019 --> 01:03:46,809
I gotta reload. There's definitely gonna be a confrontation outside. Is that it? I feel like

299
01:03:46,809 --> 01:03:56,010
way more people were shot in here. Give me this thing. Yeah. All right, there we go. Perfect.

300
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:13,510
That's like seven years of bad luck. Whatever. I don't want to worry about that.

301
01:04:13,510 --> 01:04:26,809
You gotta be fucking kidding me. Please get up. You can play that game.

302
01:04:26,809 --> 01:05:18,199
Get the ammo. This game's hard. Sign. Oh, shit. Go. I barely hit anybody. Just fell over.

303
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:26,360
This is kind of how I feel like when I used to play Left 4 Dead.

304
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:33,130
So Left 4 Dead really can only work if you all are holding the piece of furniture together

305
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:37,289
and not one person's holding all the furniture, right? But, man, there were so many times where

306
01:05:37,289 --> 01:05:41,449
I was just kind of lazy and was just kind of shooting around everything. Just kind of shooting

307
01:05:41,449 --> 01:06:01,579
bullets so people knew that I was playing. Okay, wait. You have four people. All four of you have

308
01:06:01,579 --> 01:06:06,860
to pull your weight. If not, you're gonna lose. If four of us are bringing a big couch into a living

309
01:06:06,860 --> 01:06:14,059
room, all four of us have to pull our weight or someone's gonna be bad. You're always the dead

310
01:06:14,059 --> 01:06:19,940
weight. I think one of the helicopters crashed. It's a very simple concept. What are you talking

311
01:06:19,940 --> 01:06:27,769
about? If four of us are bringing a big couch into a living room, we all have to put weight into it

312
01:06:27,769 --> 01:06:45,400
so not one person does everything and not one person can't lift a couch. Oh, my fucking god.

313
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:57,369
That guy just jumped. I thought you were talking about holding furniture in the game.

314
01:06:58,730 --> 01:06:59,610
In Left 4 Dead.

315
01:07:04,579 --> 01:07:08,420
You know, that actually would be kind of a fun game. What do I have to do?

316
01:07:12,179 --> 01:07:29,300
Like, carry furniture together? A simulator? That might be fun. What am I supposed to do about this?

317
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:40,500
Oh, that was a bad idea. Where's the explosion? Why was that one done? Holy fucking shit. That was

318
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:54,409
bad. This is really bad. What do I do? I have to take this out? Did I miss something? I have to go

319
01:07:54,409 --> 01:08:10,420
back to the bridge. Really? Now I can just shoot it? It'd be great if I had any bullets for any

320
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:21,800
gun and it takes a hundred years to reload this. It's finally reloaded. Jesus. Oh, my god. Oh, my

321
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:30,460
god. Oh, my god. This thing's still not reloaded. This gun's so bad. Why did I get two of these? What

322
01:08:30,460 --> 01:08:40,869
a stupid idea. Do I have grenades in this? This is so bad. I need a gang member. Yeah, I'll be back.

323
01:08:41,590 --> 01:08:56,680
Do I have any gang members? I had grenades. I got it. Don't worry. I'm gonna slowly take them out.

324
01:08:57,239 --> 01:09:20,119
Watch out. I think they despawned. Yeah, they do. They despawned. I want that machine gun. Come here.

325
01:09:20,119 --> 01:09:38,970
Got it. Nice. It's an easy two grand, I think. That was an hour later. I'll be here all day.

326
01:09:49,619 --> 01:10:02,170
No, you won't. Don't call me out on things that are true. Got it. Save. We're good. What the? What

327
01:10:02,170 --> 01:10:10,039
the hell is that? What is this like animated emote of like me with that like a handsome filter?

328
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:29,239
Where'd you get that? How do you have that? Whose is that? Where'd you get that? I'm so confused.

329
01:10:29,239 --> 01:10:32,439
You finally saw it. Someone else put it on their channel.

330
01:10:38,920 --> 01:11:01,579
That's illegal. That ain't that's illegal. Okay, now what? Okay, it's time to go to the weapon store

331
01:11:01,579 --> 01:11:07,720
in the mall. Go buy a bunch of ammo and grenades and shit. Don't walk around the entrance and go,

332
01:11:08,439 --> 01:11:12,039
I don't know where the entrance is. Just go in. Don't be an idiot.

333
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:54,920
You're good. You have to name this friend. Sean Silencer. How come they always have to have such

334
01:11:54,920 --> 01:12:01,319
you know bad like weapon kill hurt names? Why can't it be like tree planting Andy or something?

335
01:12:13,609 --> 01:12:26,970
Yeah, like Carl Conservationist. That's hippies.

336
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:35,159
There goes the finish on this baby. All right, how do we get into the mall?

337
01:12:37,210 --> 01:12:49,560
How do I get into the mall? I'm so dumb. I'm sorry. Mall entrance. I'm just gonna go here

338
01:12:49,560 --> 01:13:10,170
because this is underground though. I don't want to go in the garage. You can take the UFO through

339
01:13:10,170 --> 01:13:34,300
here. Really? Holy shit. This is it? Riding with you is awesome. Wait, why would you be able? Why

340
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:46,819
would there be an opening for cars to the actual mall? All right, where's the weapon store? Right

341
01:13:46,899 --> 01:14:12,470
here. Holy shit. That's cool. Okay, load up. I'm not fucking around now. I'm seriously not messing

342
01:14:12,470 --> 01:14:21,859
around. Let's go. I want. Okay, I have one of these dudes. Is there something I'm missing? Get

343
01:14:21,859 --> 01:14:35,350
get rid of this 12 gauge. Put the tombstone back on. Flashbangs. 10 flashbangs. All right, I want

344
01:14:36,229 --> 01:14:45,420
SMG ammo. I'm using all my money. Right? I don't care. Use it all. I need to be able to do this.

345
01:14:46,220 --> 01:15:02,010
What if I die? A melee I want. This is good. Pistol I want. What were the?

346
01:15:05,109 --> 01:15:17,380
Yeah, if I double vice nines. SMG. How is there no SMG available? Tombstone. Whoa, what's that?

347
01:15:17,939 --> 01:15:39,819
AR 40? Which one's better? 50 is higher than 40. So I'm gonna say 50. Okay, but do I have enough

348
01:15:39,819 --> 01:15:48,869
ammo? Should I get pistol ammo? All right, I have a ton of. I have no money. I'm out of money.

349
01:15:50,979 --> 01:16:03,000
I used $15,000. Was this worth it? Where's my buddy? Let's go. Where's the UFO? Can he get in

350
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:16,729
the UFO too? Where's the UFO? Didn't buy pistol ammo. I mean, I have almost a thousand rifle ammo.

351
01:16:16,729 --> 01:16:28,460
I think I'm gonna be all right. Where's that UFO? What spot's the UFO on? Down here. What are the burgers?

352
01:16:28,460 --> 01:17:00,090
Where is it? Turn around. Is it right here? Oh, right. I think this way. I just saved. I did.

353
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:08,649
Unedited Andy in the top right. What do you mean unedited? That's where one of the cars is. I think

354
01:17:08,649 --> 01:17:28,619
it's right here. Shit, it's not right there. Where is it? Down there? Right ahead? I'm not going to

355
01:17:28,619 --> 01:17:46,630
shoot anybody. I'm just using to see far further. Whoa, what's this place? That's good. That's good

356
01:17:46,630 --> 01:18:05,399
too. That's good. No, I want to be able to see the face. Fireman. Whoa, this looks like a chef hat.

357
01:18:10,340 --> 01:18:27,350
Cat ears. The lizard. Hold your helmet. Viking helmet. No. If I'm going to do something, I'm

358
01:18:27,350 --> 01:18:55,609
going to do the... I want to be able to see the hair. Trubs. I can't look at outfits though.

359
01:18:55,609 --> 01:19:19,420
Please do ski mask. Oh my god, this is Matthew Lesko. Hey, everyone. Me, Matthew Lesko. And I mean,

360
01:19:19,420 --> 01:19:24,140
I got these crazy government things you can get. You want to go to $20,000 to go back to school.

361
01:19:24,140 --> 01:19:29,699
I can get that for you. $40,000 to start a new job. I should be Matthew Lesko. I really should.

362
01:19:46,170 --> 01:19:54,659
Cat's too zoomer to know who Matthew Lesko is. It's great. Matthew Lesko is actually a really,

363
01:19:54,659 --> 01:20:14,260
really like wonderful person. Free money. Yeah. You know him? No, I don't. All right. Yeah. Okay.

364
01:20:14,260 --> 01:20:20,380
I don't know him, but he seems like a really, really nice person. Parasocial Andy. No, I'm just

365
01:20:20,380 --> 01:20:27,060
saying like the way that the person's presented. Just quiet or I'm going to, I'll ban everybody.

366
01:20:27,779 --> 01:20:47,340
Paris. I kind of want the lab coat. Flasher coat. Oh, all right. This is, I think I'm going to go

367
01:20:47,340 --> 01:21:02,340
with the, with the Matthew Lesko. I got style level one. Okay. Oh shit. I get 5% more respect

368
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:21,380
during activities. Okay. I need to do this. I got to change this to the same color. Is it like purple?

369
01:21:21,939 --> 01:21:35,850
Like a dark purple, like a purple pink. Where is it? Where's the green? Is it yellow? Where's yellow?

370
01:21:35,850 --> 01:21:56,619
This is darker. There it is. Oh shit. I can just look at the color right there.

371
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:10,630
Solid. Oh, the hearts. I think solid because the question marks will clash.

372
01:22:11,350 --> 01:22:39,180
Okay. I need a better hat though. Human eyes. Oh. Do cat ears, please. Ski mask. Fine. I'll do the

373
01:22:39,180 --> 01:22:48,920
ski mask. What is it? Under, over shirts? Yeah. Under shirts. Oh, it takes off the coat. I can't

374
01:22:48,920 --> 01:23:05,859
do the ski mask. Does it take, it takes the coat off, right? I don't think it does. Okay. Well,

375
01:23:05,859 --> 01:23:21,060
I'll try it. Let's see. Okay. It's just, it's, I'm just in a grim, I'm just grimace. Is that

376
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:48,899
going to work? I have to take this hat off though. It's a spy. Gentlemen. This is one of those like,

377
01:23:49,619 --> 01:23:54,260
you, you like combine two or three costumes. You're like the spy in another universe.

378
01:23:55,699 --> 01:24:16,840
I'm the spy, but I'm in the Batman universe. No, you, okay. Okay. I think we're ready.

379
01:24:17,479 --> 01:24:27,159
We're ready to go take back the, uh, the territory. Now we just need to find the UFO.

380
01:24:27,159 --> 01:24:31,699
We can skedaddle. Save. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got

381
01:24:31,699 --> 01:24:38,699
it. So I'm just going to sit here on this map because I'm, I'm, I'll walk around in a circle

382
01:24:38,699 --> 01:24:52,920
for the next 10 minutes. Where is the UFO on here? Where is it? Top right, right here.

383
01:24:53,479 --> 01:25:06,789
It's a random spawn. Oh, top left, middle and right. Like up here, up your ass. Fuck you.

384
01:25:06,789 --> 01:25:14,789
You know what? No, let me freeze for a second. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. You know what

385
01:25:14,789 --> 01:25:30,420
I mean? All right. It's right there. Let's try it. Oh shit. That's a nice car. Fuck you. You know

386
01:25:30,420 --> 01:25:52,970
what I mean? No, that's where I came in with the car. It's not a top right. It's a random. I,

387
01:25:52,970 --> 01:26:04,310
I'm just going to get in the car and just drive around and who cares. I thought German was the

388
01:26:04,310 --> 01:26:09,340
nice guy. I am. I really am. I'm, I've just been having fun, right? It's all just a joke.

389
01:26:09,979 --> 01:26:14,939
Nothing I say is really, you should never take seriously. Fuck you. You know what I mean?

390
01:26:15,579 --> 01:26:25,270
I want people to know that this is a place for positivity. Fuck you. You know what I mean? And

391
01:26:25,270 --> 01:26:28,949
for us to come together and be good friends. Fuck you. You know what I mean?

392
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:51,420
Where is the UFO? I'm just like, this car is insane. We're just taking this thing. Are you

393
01:26:51,420 --> 01:26:56,970
kidding me? We're just going to keep this. Why would I take something else? Let's get the hell

394
01:26:56,970 --> 01:27:17,739
out of here. UFO or riot. I don't know what it's, it's a random spawn somewhere. Wait, what's called

395
01:27:17,739 --> 01:27:39,779
UFO? No. Oh, that was cool. All right. I get, I have to leave. I have to get out of this. I've,

396
01:27:40,340 --> 01:27:47,210
you want to know something? Here's a little insight. I'm not kidding. When I say this,

397
01:27:47,210 --> 01:27:54,489
this is for real. Listen to me. Even at a real mall, a real one. If I, even if I've been there

398
01:27:54,489 --> 01:28:01,369
500 times, I don't know where I am. I don't know where I am because everything's the same.

399
01:28:01,930 --> 01:28:13,479
What the fuck is going on in here? It doesn't matter if I've been there 10 times, 50 times,

400
01:28:13,479 --> 01:28:18,359
a thousand times. I don't know where the Auntie Anne's pretzel is, if you ask me.

401
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:23,079
And it sucks so bad in these positions when like stuff like kind of in the say is the same.

402
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:33,020
When everything like looks the same, everything like is the same. Jesus Christ. Because people

403
01:28:33,020 --> 01:28:42,119
will ask me, people will ask me, Hey dude. Oh yeah. Oh, you, you know this place. Where's the

404
01:28:42,119 --> 01:28:58,810
Auntie Anne? And I have to pretend like I know where it is yet. Help me. It's like getting stuck

405
01:28:58,810 --> 01:29:15,060
in snow. Just pick up a few chairs and get rid of them. Um, but yeah, like anything that is a bunch

406
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:21,670
of stores or a bunch of stuff that looks very similar, my brain cannot put it into long-term

407
01:29:21,670 --> 01:29:28,229
memory because it's one gigantic place. It's not multiple places in one. It's not multiple places

408
01:29:28,229 --> 01:29:52,539
inside of one place. It's one place and I can't differentiate it. Is that enough? You have to be,

409
01:29:52,539 --> 01:30:10,090
you actually have to be kidding. Can I shoot them? Maybe I can shoot them away. Jesus dude.

410
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:41,380
Okay. Almost there. Got it. I almost just blew up and screamed. Where's the exit?

411
01:30:41,380 --> 01:31:08,810
How do I get out of here? Help me please. Is it right? I'm in tears. What are you laughing this

412
01:31:08,810 --> 01:31:15,300
hard? How? What? Why are you laughing so hard? What do you mean you're in tears?

413
01:31:21,859 --> 01:31:28,739
Is it on the second level? I think it's up here because remember

414
01:31:29,460 --> 01:31:43,460
I came in this way I think. Um, I think right like this way over here. This is the top floor.

415
01:31:53,350 --> 01:32:08,890
Okay then up this way. All right there it is. Is this it? Is this it? Get the fuck out of here.

416
01:32:08,890 --> 01:32:16,149
I'm never going in there ever again. It's the concrete. It's the different leveled concrete

417
01:32:16,149 --> 01:32:34,300
with everything same in there. I'm not going to freak out. Those of you that saw the Hitman 3

418
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:40,789
playthrough. That's uh, that's one of the maddest I've been in the entire year I think. And I

419
01:32:40,789 --> 01:32:44,789
pretended I was high. So people wouldn't even think I was an idiot. All right you ready? Let's

420
01:32:44,789 --> 01:33:00,119
go. Save the game. We're going. We're gonna uh, whatever. Get in there. What's wrong with the- oh

421
01:33:01,670 --> 01:33:47,699
tire. Not fucking around this time. I swear to god. Open up. Open up. Good. Go. 20 fps. Let's go.

422
01:33:47,779 --> 01:34:37,960
Get. Oh no you have like a hostage. What was that? Was that an explosion? Like I'm too,

423
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:42,199
I'm too much like a fat guy to turn and spray faster so I just hold it down.

424
01:34:43,930 --> 01:34:48,250
All right we gotta have to have a new plan here I think. It's the grenade launcher. Oh right right

425
01:34:48,250 --> 01:35:07,960
right right right. We need a new car. This brake. We have to get a new car like right now. Are you

426
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:16,260
out of the way? Get out of there. What's this guy's name? Sleepy? Sleepy Sean? I forget what

427
01:35:16,260 --> 01:35:35,829
his name was. Let's go. In. He's in. Good. Silencer Sean. Okay. I'm out of. We're losing control. We

428
01:35:35,829 --> 01:35:49,850
gotta get out. It's gonna explode in a minute. They're everywhere. This is unbelievable. Get in

429
01:35:49,850 --> 01:36:23,050
this one. Silencer let's go. Come on silencer. Get in the car. How did you have the top down

430
01:36:23,050 --> 01:36:29,689
in this car? I don't understand. Do you see how relentless they are? They're glued to you.

431
01:36:36,550 --> 01:36:54,899
He's not even looking. Oh shit. Okay hold on. They're up. Up up up up up up up right here. I'm

432
01:36:54,899 --> 01:37:01,750
gonna shoot a grenade. Who was shooting who there? That was confusing. I think that did that person

433
01:37:01,750 --> 01:37:08,659
have a hostage? I have no idea. We got it. Thank god. How do you feel about Garfield precisely?

434
01:37:09,770 --> 01:37:17,159
Um Garfield should have been a mini series that lasted like a year. I think people would be

435
01:37:17,159 --> 01:37:38,869
happier. All right we got our everything back. Tiny face cam. There's no face cam.

436
01:37:39,590 --> 01:37:57,529
Where do you guys see a face cam? What? Up right? Yeah. All right now that's taken care of. I'm

437
01:37:57,529 --> 01:38:20,329
gonna do the other the next Roman mission. Face cam over the guy's face. You can call an ambulance

438
01:38:20,329 --> 01:38:38,090
to heal. I need to make friends. I want to be able to call people to come help me in situations.

439
01:38:38,090 --> 01:38:55,079
Looking stupid. For one second I thought the guy in the passenger seat was driving and there was

440
01:38:55,079 --> 01:39:10,680
a blanket in the front seat. Well that was custom upholstery for the seat. Like this is what I saw

441
01:39:10,680 --> 01:39:29,510
for a second. It was like a weird angle. Where's Johnny? Oh I sent him out to the store. You should

442
01:39:29,510 --> 01:39:36,069
be back. Who the hell is that? Yo that's our new houseguest baby. I caught this asshole riding

443
01:39:36,069 --> 01:39:43,670
around our turf. Got something you want to tell me? Go to hell. That wasn't very nice.

444
01:39:45,670 --> 01:39:52,810
That was so loud my head hurts now. Why the fuck are you here? Whatever you do to me is nothing

445
01:39:52,810 --> 01:40:01,270
compared to what Mr. Okuji will do to you. The oil burn? No shit. When's he coming? I'll die before

446
01:40:01,270 --> 01:40:11,270
I tell you. Yep. It better. You get okay. You don't you say you're gonna do it you don't do it

447
01:40:11,270 --> 01:40:15,670
you see if he tells you anything. You gotta give me at least two or three chances. This guy's a

448
01:40:15,670 --> 01:40:19,770
fucking boogeyman. When I was in jail I would listen to some of the Ronin talk about what this

449
01:40:19,770 --> 01:40:26,659
guy did in Japan. It's not pretty. You think he's old talk? I don't know but I'm looking forward

450
01:40:26,659 --> 01:40:33,319
to finding out. You cool taking out those fuckers by yourself. Or oh here's an idea.

451
01:40:33,319 --> 01:40:42,460
No problem man. Level with the guy. Put the gun down. Set him down. Be like look here's where

452
01:40:42,460 --> 01:40:54,090
we're coming from. Like like order like order like pizza. Talk about everything. Be like look

453
01:40:55,449 --> 01:41:05,779
we can level here. Then when they give you the information you might have you might have already

454
01:41:05,779 --> 01:41:26,659
to remember. Oh you got somebody on the inside. I was gonna say then you throw him out the window

455
01:41:26,659 --> 01:41:53,770
but no I didn't want to say that. I have to destroy all these right? I wasn't why was I

456
01:41:53,770 --> 01:42:00,699
wasn't looking to chat he's dead oh no. What the fuck? How do I get back on the bike? You're about

457
01:42:00,699 --> 01:42:25,640
to abandon a follower? Where is he? I don't even know where he is. What? Where is he? You want to

458
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:36,090
come here? I have no idea where he is. Abandoned apparently. Old up to dismiss party. Oh okay here

459
01:42:36,090 --> 01:43:07,979
we go. Let's go. Don't shoot. Christ. Get on the right side of the road you idiot. New friend.

460
01:43:22,409 --> 01:43:43,260
Whatever. Let's go. Oh wait we got we got slimy Sean back. What was the point of that entire U-turn?

461
01:43:50,250 --> 01:44:08,279
These missions are kind of hard. Here we go. All right four to four.

462
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:25,020
No here it is. Here's four. I don't think that's so close to me. Why is this not disabled? Uh huh.

463
01:44:25,020 --> 01:44:37,369
What? What are you talking about? That was four. How is he dead? It was the wrong bike?

464
01:44:38,090 --> 01:45:23,989
He's dead. How am I gonna pull it out of the concrete? Get on. Okay if I get close enough

465
01:45:23,989 --> 01:45:39,989
he should be able to shoot them right? Theoretically. I didn't hit anything. The guy was lying.

466
01:45:40,789 --> 01:45:54,140
I guess I- my god fuck you. Fuck you god damn it. All right there's only one more come on.

467
01:45:54,140 --> 01:46:28,390
Don't please do not fly. Dread air. Am I gonna catch up? I did it. Okay we're good.

468
01:46:53,689 --> 01:46:57,930
Not for long. Why's that? I've got my best man working on that now.

469
01:46:58,649 --> 01:47:02,729
Do some of the other missions. We've been doing most of the Ronin stuff.

470
01:47:02,729 --> 01:47:14,539
Maybe we'll start somewhere else. Ronins have the best missions though. What is it Shogo?

471
01:47:15,500 --> 01:47:20,710
I'll take care of it like always.

472
01:47:34,539 --> 01:47:43,909
I want to buy a car that's mine that I keep in a garage. I don't just want to steal cars for the

473
01:47:43,909 --> 01:48:00,439
entire game. Okay this is the loft. It's for sale. How about another Ronin mission? Why not?

474
01:48:01,079 --> 01:48:15,300
You can literally steal any car for free in store. Yeah aren't there some cars you can only buy?

475
01:48:16,100 --> 01:48:22,180
Aren't there some kind of- because this is Gentleman of the Row. So isn't there some things

476
01:48:22,180 --> 01:48:37,989
that I can only get from Gentleman of the Row? Is this better than Saints Row 3? Um I don't-

477
01:48:37,989 --> 01:48:44,550
people feel the same way about Saints Row that people feel about Dark Souls. Very contested.

478
01:48:44,550 --> 01:48:51,960
Very heated. Saints Row 2 is the best. No that's an idiotic opinion. Saints Row 4 is the best.

479
01:48:52,680 --> 01:49:07,880
Are you serious? That's the worst one. From my understanding, from what I've been told and

480
01:49:07,880 --> 01:49:14,039
because I've never lived- I've never played these. Saints Row 2 is the combination of the seriousness

481
01:49:14,039 --> 01:49:19,880
of Saints Row 1 potentially with like a little bit of the more cartoony weird wacky shit that

482
01:49:19,880 --> 01:49:36,979
they did in the later games. I've heard that's the middle ground here is Saints Row 2. Sorry

483
01:49:36,979 --> 01:49:50,010
I was reading chat. This is the middle ground. Um if you don't know the Saints Row franchise

484
01:49:50,010 --> 01:49:55,449
eventually you can run up buildings and fly and stuff. You actually have superpowers.

485
01:49:56,010 --> 01:50:01,720
It's a superhero game. They're kind of rebooting the whole franchise right? And didn't they say

486
01:50:02,520 --> 01:50:09,239
that uh we can't- we have to like reel it back to reality because they went too far in the fourth

487
01:50:09,239 --> 01:50:22,729
one? I have no idea how that one's going to turn out. That was stupid. What does Dark Souls have

488
01:50:22,729 --> 01:50:27,770
to do with this? Um well that's easy. There's like four games in the Dark Souls quote series.

489
01:50:28,409 --> 01:50:35,270
You count Demon's Souls. Uh and everybody thinks that Dark Souls 1 is the best. But then you have

490
01:50:35,270 --> 01:50:39,029
people that think Dark Souls 3 is better than Dark Souls 1. Then you have people that say that uh

491
01:50:39,029 --> 01:50:52,060
that Demon's Souls is better than all of them. And you've got the weirdos that think that Dark

492
01:50:52,060 --> 01:51:20,140
Souls 2 is the best one right? Pleasureness. Then let me go. That depends on you. Dark Souls 2 is

493
01:51:20,140 --> 01:51:28,300
the best one. I can't take anything going on seriously. Like I- should I like

494
01:51:28,300 --> 01:51:44,899
drag the sliders back a little? You should go to a plastic surgeon.

495
01:51:52,939 --> 01:51:57,579
The person just like landed on their neck. The person just put themselves in the hospital.

496
01:51:57,579 --> 01:52:36,710
Oh shit. This is really making me understand that like nobody kind of- nobody looks cool

497
01:52:36,710 --> 01:53:19,289
in a superhero costume doing stuff. You can't hear me. I know. Oh shit no. Of course it doesn't work.

498
01:53:19,289 --> 01:53:46,949
You didn't pull the trigger. Oh all right. Good- good thing- good thing Sli-Sli-Slippery

499
01:53:47,270 --> 01:53:52,680
is here with me. Protect Gat? Where- oh he's back there.

500
01:53:57,050 --> 01:54:01,130
We have to- get off- get off the bike. Get off the bike. Get off the bike. You gotta go. You gotta go.

501
01:54:01,130 --> 01:54:05,449
You gotta go. You gotta go. You gotta go. Who- where are you? Where are they? Where are they?

502
01:54:06,090 --> 01:54:20,939
Do I have to pick him up? What do we do? Is he all right? What's happening? Why is it a countdown?

503
01:54:21,500 --> 01:54:38,060
Why is there a countdown? Is it gonna explode? What? Flash man go now!

504
01:54:38,619 --> 01:55:02,199
What are you calling me? Are you kidding me? Did it- what the fuck?

505
01:55:05,220 --> 01:55:09,220
Watch where you're shooting. You're gonna shoot him in the head. You're gonna shoot him in the head.

506
01:55:09,220 --> 01:55:14,100
It's easy with where you're aiming the gun. What the fuck was that? Oh I have a bazooka.

507
01:55:14,100 --> 01:55:22,279
I didn't know I had a bazooka. They just give you these weapons. I didn't know I had this.

508
01:55:26,180 --> 01:55:29,460
That's- those aren't even enemies. He's gonna hit him in the head.

509
01:55:37,180 --> 01:55:49,289
Just focus on driving the car you fucking idiot. This is so stupid. I can't even aim this. He's-

510
01:55:49,289 --> 01:56:00,869
what's happening? Who's in front of us? Why are we on fire? I can't shoot anybody with this

511
01:56:00,869 --> 01:56:14,569
because it's too close. We're gonna die. We're supposed to be going to the hospital. I think

512
01:56:14,569 --> 01:56:26,069
he's driven in a circle. I can't fire at this close. What? Stop jerking the car around. For

513
01:56:26,069 --> 01:56:49,289
the love of god just drives normally. We're driving on somebody's house? Holy shit. That was

514
01:56:49,289 --> 01:57:08,539
unbelievable. Crazy taxi. Here we go. Sorry that was 1080 snowboarding. I mixed them up together.

515
01:57:18,810 --> 01:57:36,630
Can we get out? Oh my god he's running people over. Play the America's Funniest Home Videos

516
01:57:36,630 --> 01:57:50,659
theme song right now. No. Where's he going? I don't know. I'm not driving. I think he's

517
01:57:50,659 --> 01:58:05,500
driving to the hospital. I think? This guy is absolutely- he's gonna stick around. What's

518
01:58:05,500 --> 01:58:13,529
this guy's name? Slobber and Sam? No no no that's a 90s kids board game. Whatever his name is. Who

519
01:58:13,529 --> 01:58:26,090
cares? Doesn't matter. Oh that was a stupid idea but we're okay. John Silencer. That's right.

520
01:58:28,310 --> 01:59:00,340
I look so happy. I have a big smile. Where's the hospital? Can I switch weapons? I can't switch

521
01:59:00,340 --> 01:59:28,220
weapons. This guy's lost? It kind of feels that way. I don't have to do anything do I? Check the

522
01:59:28,220 --> 01:59:50,810
map. Is it hospital right here? Oh there it is. Okay we made it. Can we get out? All right we're

523
01:59:50,810 --> 02:00:10,010
good. Taking him to plastic surgery. He just comes out with like a cheek implant or something.

524
02:00:10,569 --> 02:00:15,369
He's dead.

525
02:00:28,890 --> 02:00:51,319
Must be so sweaty and hot under that mask. 500 cash per day. I get 6,000. Should I do an activity?

526
02:00:51,319 --> 02:01:23,000
Maybe I should. What's this one? Please go to the plastic surgeon. Should I? Yes finally finally

527
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:34,119
finally finally yes finally finally finally. What do you mean finally? Okay. Let me just design

528
02:01:34,119 --> 02:01:37,399
allows you to change your appearance, customize your movement, combat style, taunts and compliments.

529
02:01:37,399 --> 02:01:43,350
Oh okay. It also removes your notoriety. Well I don't want to change. I don't want to change

530
02:01:43,350 --> 02:02:03,500
my- I don't want to change Grimace. I wanted to do this though whatever it was. What do we want here?

531
02:02:03,579 --> 02:02:21,430
The the grill? The griddler? Like a mcriddle? The mcriddler? Thank god I just saved because

532
02:02:21,430 --> 02:02:43,140
the game crashed. I like the mcriddler. That's a good one. Please put the sliders back a little

533
02:02:43,140 --> 02:03:02,340
bit. I don't think we- I can't do that. Crashed again? Shit. That's not good. Ooh too powerful.

534
02:03:03,140 --> 02:03:13,659
Take a pee break. Uh maybe in a minute. I'm locked in. This game's boring you should play Fortnite.

535
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:32,439
Yeah I see you right here. All right can I- isn't there something I can do?

536
02:03:34,140 --> 02:03:40,979
Right? This is- why is it so bright in here? Holy goodness. What the hell? It's so bright.

537
02:03:41,460 --> 02:04:02,140
Is this illuminated paint in here? What? Whoa. It was 10 grand in that. Oh that's awesome.

538
02:04:02,699 --> 02:04:14,390
All right nice. I got money now. I'm gonna go buy something. I finally went into a house and took

539
02:04:14,390 --> 02:04:27,939
the money. Yeah. Is there anything in the garage? Probably not. No. Nothing. Gamble it all the way?

540
02:04:27,939 --> 02:04:39,189
No. Oh what's this here? Oh wait there's the the hitman activities. Let me see what they were.

541
02:04:39,189 --> 02:04:47,609
Trailer park hitman. Okay. You know the security security guard for the trailer park. Start a fight

542
02:04:47,609 --> 02:04:52,840
in the area and someone is bound to call them over to settle the argument. Okay go to the trailer

543
02:04:52,840 --> 02:05:04,869
park district and fight the security guard. The trailer park district is where? Insurance fraud

544
02:05:04,869 --> 02:05:26,100
activities are really fun. It's the crutches icon. Have I found one? It's the left side? Okay.

545
02:05:26,100 --> 02:05:52,220
Check the south. Okay. Change filters on the map. Well here's mayhem. I don't think I've even seen

546
02:05:52,220 --> 02:06:10,500
a crutches. Should we go here? I haven't found any you know. Let's go see what this is. The McRiddler.

547
02:06:13,319 --> 02:06:17,159
McRiddler absolutely is confirmed for the end of the year rumble by the way.

548
02:06:18,699 --> 02:06:25,939
Kind of a hundred and all stats. Oh by the way let's talk about that real quick. This weekend

549
02:06:27,140 --> 02:06:34,060
probably before Sunday's stream the New Year's Eve categories are going to be up.

550
02:06:34,060 --> 02:06:38,789
Probably this will be on Sunday and you're going to be able to do them. We're going to go through

551
02:06:38,789 --> 02:06:46,619
the nominating process again and then a week or two later voting will open and then obviously

552
02:06:46,619 --> 02:06:55,779
two or three weeks later we'll do the award show. So look for the nominees to open up this weekend.

553
02:06:57,260 --> 02:06:59,899
If a lot of people are probably new to the channel in the last year.

554
02:07:01,340 --> 02:07:10,550
Every year we do an event on New Year's Eve. That is the worst of the year and some best of the

555
02:07:10,550 --> 02:07:14,920
year as well. Talking the worst stream of the year. Worst noise I've made the whole year.

556
02:07:15,640 --> 02:07:21,109
The worst face I've made the whole year. The annual tradition. We're going to keep it up again

557
02:07:21,109 --> 02:07:26,359
this year. If you'd like to participate. You remember an exact moment in time where

558
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:31,239
you were like that face was awful and it was disgusting. He looked terrible. His hair looked

559
02:07:31,239 --> 02:07:40,470
awful. Worst hair. Give us the timestamp. Give us the clip. We'll go from there. Annual cyber

560
02:07:40,470 --> 02:07:55,979
bullying of the streamer. The worst hair ever was last year. I know and it'll never get. I don't

561
02:07:55,979 --> 02:08:12,539
think you'll ever find one that's worse. What is this? That's a new icon. Fight club. Are you

562
02:08:12,539 --> 02:08:15,979
going to stream the game awards on the 9th? Yeah I would say so.

563
02:08:21,180 --> 02:08:25,979
The right idea. Horse pussy man. I can break any of those assholes that are fighting if I was

564
02:08:25,979 --> 02:08:31,739
cleared. The fight's going on now. Yeah. Shit I might as well take your spot. Hey you can't do

565
02:08:31,739 --> 02:08:42,420
that. Yeah why don't you run and catch up. Hey fuck you asshole. Okay. Compete in brutal fighting

566
02:08:42,420 --> 02:08:48,010
matches for cash and respect. Pick up and eat food to recover health. Kill all the fighters and

567
02:08:48,010 --> 02:08:58,039
survive. Two one. I got a good tactic. It's called run and let them fight each other first. Oh wait

568
02:08:58,039 --> 02:09:16,979
it's 2v1 never mind. Is that illegal? Wait you can kick people in the balls. That's not illegal.

569
02:09:23,029 --> 02:09:40,949
I feel like it would be really. Oh shit. They just dropped that on his head. Finish opponents

570
02:09:40,949 --> 02:09:55,829
after a knockdown to take them out of the fight. I don't know what one is. It's A. Where'd you go?

571
02:09:56,470 --> 02:10:07,029
That guy didn't have a chance. I feel like I'm going to be really good at this.

572
02:10:13,560 --> 02:10:32,250
A hundred bucks. That's a lot of respect. Let's keep going. Okay level two. Three two one.

573
02:10:34,819 --> 02:10:52,500
Go get style points for taunting. Come on give me the trash. Put that down. Get out of here.

574
02:11:04,729 --> 02:11:19,590
Shit he has it. That thing's too hard to swing. Wait what's two? Oh no that's bad. A or is it B?

575
02:11:20,310 --> 02:11:37,239
Okay it's X. Two is X. Dude I just keep changing. I don't know what these are.

576
02:11:37,800 --> 02:11:41,159
With the command prompts. I'm just gonna have to pick up the fucking mouse and do it.

577
02:11:41,800 --> 02:12:02,250
What is it? Game. I just fucking. If I press. I just right clicked and the fucking window minimized.

578
02:12:02,810 --> 02:12:26,119
What is right click on the controller? Right click. It would be left trigger. Yep. Blunt.

579
02:12:32,949 --> 02:12:58,119
That didn't. That hurt me. That didn't even do anything good for me. Oh very cool. Nice. This is

580
02:12:58,119 --> 02:13:08,869
a really good way to farm respect. 3v1. All right this is gonna get hard. Especially because of the

581
02:13:08,869 --> 02:13:41,750
not knowing what the buttons are. Hit him. Oh rock bottom. Rock bottom. Why did I stand up and fall?

582
02:13:41,750 --> 02:13:55,159
This is an unfair weight class. Left. Left click is right trigger. Right? Yeah. It's just confusing.

583
02:14:04,810 --> 02:14:16,899
What is it? That's. No god it's left. What is that? Left trigger. Left click is right trigger.

584
02:14:16,899 --> 02:14:29,449
Because that's. Shoot. That's. Okay I'm pissed. Left trigger is aim. It is?

585
02:14:30,250 --> 02:14:59,220
So it'll be right. Left. So it'll be right trigger. Okay. There we go. All right. We're good.

586
02:15:06,489 --> 02:15:23,979
I got a little weird. Left is right. Yeah. It's confusing me. Yeah the button prompts are supposed

587
02:15:23,979 --> 02:15:33,100
to be in the mod. I looked back at the um like at the mod files. It's supposed to be there.

588
02:15:33,100 --> 02:15:44,460
You've unlocked the nut punch. Okay. There's an option in the installer. Yeah. You didn't pick

589
02:15:44,460 --> 02:15:50,390
that option. The installer I was kind of scared of. Because it was like just build it the default mod

590
02:15:50,390 --> 02:15:54,649
the way that the mod is meant to be played. Or you could go through and pick stuff and it would

591
02:15:54,649 --> 02:15:59,460
add it but it wouldn't. I don't know. It was confusing. As you play Saints Row 2 you unlock

592
02:15:59,460 --> 02:16:12,630
rewards. To see them press the pause menu. Is it going to be impossible? Maybe they actually are

593
02:16:12,630 --> 02:16:21,659
fighting each other. They are. All right. Just run away. Come on gridler. You need to save.

594
02:16:22,300 --> 02:16:34,500
All right. That guy. That's the guy to beat right there. The Hurricane Rana guy. It's the Abyss

595
02:16:34,500 --> 02:16:57,540
Watchers. It is. I just hit myself in the face with the trash can. Are you kidding me?

596
02:16:58,180 --> 02:17:25,049
I need a hamburger on the ground. What is it? Two. Start. Give me it. Drink it. That feels like

597
02:17:25,049 --> 02:17:49,879
cheating. I feel like I'm drinking Estus. Fight. Fight each other. Don't just fight me. This guy's

598
02:17:49,879 --> 02:18:18,069
close. All right. This guy's done. That was the really scary guy. He was doing like roundhouse

599
02:18:18,069 --> 02:18:32,860
kicks and shit. How many levels are there? Ten. You can switch your fighting style at the surgeon.

600
02:18:37,530 --> 02:18:41,209
If you drank the Estus flask at any point in Dark Souls you're not a real gamer.

601
02:18:41,209 --> 02:19:08,870
That's fine. Five people. I'm not going to be able to string any combos together on anybody.

602
02:19:08,870 --> 02:19:29,159
I don't think at least. I'm just spamming. I don't even know who I'm hitting. Dark Souls

603
02:19:29,159 --> 02:19:33,049
Resident Sleeper. Really? People love that game. What do you mean?

604
02:19:47,190 --> 02:20:00,020
There's one guy that doesn't like Dark Souls. You know there's one guy for everything. Always

605
02:20:00,020 --> 02:20:17,459
remember that you are the one guy for something. Always. No matter what. I'm trying to think of

606
02:20:17,459 --> 02:20:26,260
what I'm the one guy for. There's probably a few things. What am I the one guy of?

607
02:20:26,260 --> 02:20:42,229
What opinion do I have? What thing would I say? The sus guy. Well I'm not though.

608
02:20:47,690 --> 02:21:21,159
I hope they booed that. Damn it. This is really easy to do though. I'm farming respect. Get him.

609
02:21:21,159 --> 02:21:43,370
Get him. Wait hold on. I'm trying to hit an audience member. Are you streaming the game awards?

610
02:21:43,370 --> 02:22:03,639
Yes. In my special outfit. 11,000 respect. Nice. There's more. One, two, three, four, five, six.

611
02:22:03,639 --> 02:22:23,899
Are we really going to put ten people in here? No way. I have $20,000. This is awesome. All right.

612
02:22:23,899 --> 02:22:36,010
Focus. The second somebody kicks somebody in the balls everything's stopping and then this person

613
02:22:36,010 --> 02:22:41,819
is gonna get thrown out. I'm gonna get fucking beat up on the way out of this place. I'm gonna

614
02:22:41,819 --> 02:23:05,459
get my fucking face kicked in all the way outside of the restaurant. Save the game. Whatever. Like

615
02:23:05,459 --> 02:23:15,450
the arena. I don't know why I said restaurant. That's true. Kick him. Let me up. Get away from me.

616
02:23:17,540 --> 02:23:21,379
God damn it. See I kicked somebody in the balls and now everybody wants to kill me.

617
02:23:28,100 --> 02:23:35,989
I'm gonna lose. Oh wait he's got me. He's gonna break my neck. I didn't know they could do it to you

618
02:23:35,989 --> 02:24:00,920
too. I'm just gonna be a vulture. What the? Oh it changes. No I wanted that. Give me that.

619
02:24:12,600 --> 02:24:23,350
Omega low five-year-old. What do you mean five-year-old? I'm okay. Everything's fine.

620
02:24:23,350 --> 02:24:38,709
Presidency. I know I'm just like doing this over and over again but I'm getting so much

621
02:24:38,709 --> 02:24:53,659
money and so much respect. It's barely really helpful. Game's gonna crash. I hope not.

622
02:24:54,219 --> 02:25:10,920
Can I save it right now? What? Progress during this activity will not save. That's annoying.

623
02:25:16,920 --> 02:25:51,319
Please. Okay there we go. Saves what level you got up to. All right. Holy shit. Five grand. Holy shit

624
02:25:51,319 --> 02:26:02,219
this is awesome. I unlocked pump. Your melee attacks now do a lot more damage. So okay somebody

625
02:26:02,219 --> 02:26:08,219
correct me here. If I exit this, save it, and then go back. Can I play at level six or do I have to

626
02:26:08,219 --> 02:26:23,670
start at level one? Well that was it. That actually was the whole thing. Oh okay. Nice. I got a ton of

627
02:26:23,670 --> 02:26:34,100
respect for that. I'm at time seven respect. Cool. All right let's go. Where should I do the...

628
02:26:37,579 --> 02:26:51,530
What else is down here? I'll do insurance fraud. Yeah yeah yeah. Over here? Do insurance. I'm going.

629
02:27:03,139 --> 02:27:15,959
This is so much fun. Can I tell you guys that? Can we just talk? I didn't get very much sleep

630
02:27:15,959 --> 02:27:22,040
last night. I'm so fucking excited. I can't wait. It's gonna be so much fun.

631
02:27:24,620 --> 02:27:33,350
Ugh. There's so much fun shit to do. I just want to scream it at you. You know what I mean? I want to

632
02:27:33,350 --> 02:27:42,469
scream it so loud. I want to yell at you. It's all I can think about. I can't think of anything else.

633
02:27:43,030 --> 02:28:06,809
Is that it? Immolation derby. That sounds like fun. I'm doing it. What are you talking about?

634
02:28:07,450 --> 02:28:28,819
I'm talking about 2022. It is going to be a lot of fun. Where is this? The streamer is vague. Yeah I

635
02:28:28,819 --> 02:28:51,159
know. Congrats on the kid. You know there was one point where I wanted to hire like a five-year-old

636
02:28:51,159 --> 02:28:59,049
actor to come in the room and be like. Like dad. Like can you. I'm scared. Can you read me a story?

637
02:28:59,049 --> 02:29:03,190
And I was gonna be like it's okay son. I'll be in there in a minute. I was gonna have like a

638
02:29:03,190 --> 02:29:10,870
five-year-old actor like be on stream and pretend to be like my son. People would be like what the

639
02:29:10,870 --> 02:29:16,680
you have like a six-year-old? What? And I'd be like yeah I just got I've kept it private you know.

640
02:29:16,680 --> 02:29:36,170
Okay select your car for the demo. Oh I select my car. There's gonna be an actor. It was gonna be

641
02:29:36,170 --> 02:30:00,920
an actor. That would have been fucked up. Okay car. I want this. Level one. Level two. Oh wait

642
02:30:00,920 --> 02:30:06,920
I only have one point? What do you mean one point? Make it a fully grown adult actor?

643
02:30:10,620 --> 02:30:17,530
You don't think that would have been weird? You don't think that was it's weird if a full

644
02:30:17,530 --> 02:30:25,049
grown adult walked in here and was like asking me to like read um are you serious? My version

645
02:30:25,049 --> 02:30:40,540
was weird but that one's the the funny one. I think I'm gonna do defense. Eight car demolition

646
02:30:40,540 --> 02:30:46,420
derby and destroy your opponent's cars. Let's do it. Three two get an elderly actor.

647
02:30:48,020 --> 02:31:10,139
Just let them fight each other. Oh no. Have hire an entire family. I already did that.

648
02:31:12,200 --> 02:31:17,270
I already did that stream. You may not have been here when I did but I did that already.

649
02:31:17,989 --> 02:31:28,069
Those of you that want some lore uh go to go type in the family dinner. German985 into like

650
02:31:28,069 --> 02:31:36,309
YouTube or Google. I already did that and people hated it. People fucking hated that stream.

651
02:31:36,629 --> 02:31:43,829
They were like it was so awkward and scary. I hated every second of it. The editor of that

652
02:31:43,829 --> 02:31:50,860
video said that's my least favorite thing that I've ever done for the channel. I was like I'm

653
02:31:50,860 --> 02:32:13,579
sorry. Oh my god dude. What the fuck? What are they all doing? They're all going after me.

654
02:32:14,379 --> 02:32:27,420
I'm gonna explode. You have a money goal I have to hit? Yeah but these guys all have

655
02:32:27,420 --> 02:32:46,340
additions to their car. This car sucks. This one sucks. Why are my ears ringing? Get me out of here.

656
02:32:46,819 --> 02:33:18,819
Why are my ears ringing? All right so is it this one? Come on what is it? Is this what is

657
02:33:18,819 --> 02:33:37,260
the heart? What is this? Oh um uh I think we're gonna walk by this one for now. Where's the

658
02:33:37,260 --> 02:33:46,729
insurance fraud? All right if it's not this one then it's gonna do the brown emission. It's not

659
02:33:46,729 --> 02:33:57,239
TOS. Yeah I escort activity to me feels like something I would need to be careful of on stream.

660
02:33:57,959 --> 02:34:10,020
It's 1500 bucks? What? Oh okay there's somebody very very there's somebody in the car.

661
02:34:22,950 --> 02:34:41,420
Don't crash. I'm trying not to. It sounds like the Macho Man Randy Savage videos where he's

662
02:34:41,420 --> 02:35:07,290
breathing and just it's only the breaths that are edited. It's just like no Jesus god no 12

663
02:35:07,290 --> 02:35:17,750
seconds please. 12 seconds please. It's enough to take me to the boiling point.

664
02:35:21,030 --> 02:35:58,709
1500 dollars I'll take it. How come? Give me my money. What's it doing? This. It's like jeep. Hold on

665
02:35:58,709 --> 02:36:12,790
stop. It's my favorite shitty rift. Anybody else have a favorite shitty default rift?

666
02:36:13,430 --> 02:36:58,840
Shake it. Riff riff. Yeah whatever. You know what I meant. Okay right there. Let's go. There's

667
02:36:58,840 --> 02:37:06,059
nobody driving that. Oh I was about to let go. There's nobody driving that. What's up?

668
02:37:07,020 --> 02:37:45,350
That's not that one. Okay I'm so fucking done with this. I just it's the sex palace. I don't

669
02:37:45,350 --> 02:38:04,340
want to go in there. All right you guys keep talking about this insurance fraud mission

670
02:38:04,340 --> 02:38:18,469
but it's not on the map. Is it just is it rare? How rare is this? It's above the burger.

671
02:38:19,030 --> 02:38:37,750
I could have pissed so bad. What's down here? I swear to fucking god arrest me. Just take me to

672
02:38:37,750 --> 02:38:50,700
jail. Arrest me right now. I'll go to jail willingly. Please. I just almost I peed.

673
02:38:51,260 --> 02:38:54,620
I actually that little drop of piss came out that scared the shit out of me.

674
02:38:54,620 --> 02:38:57,579
There was no reason why I was going to get struck by lightning underground or anything.

675
02:38:57,579 --> 02:39:21,430
I almost peed and I think I may have. It's not there. Off left island. How do I get here?

676
02:39:22,069 --> 02:39:44,170
Is this like the prison? A power plant. Top right museum district. Okay right here.

677
02:39:44,170 --> 02:39:59,459
This is really far away from where I am right now. I'm gonna take a pee break after this.

678
02:40:00,020 --> 02:40:23,959
I'm not gonna do the mission. I'm just gonna get up there. Yeah why is it so bright? I want

679
02:40:23,959 --> 02:40:43,129
a motorcycle. It'll be faster. Never mind because my gpu is fucked up. You should bottle and sell

680
02:40:43,129 --> 02:41:10,899
your urine. You guys are actually fucking crazy. It's just a constant stream of just nonsense.

681
02:41:11,459 --> 02:41:22,229
What have I done to you? Ah here it is. I'm gonna like once a week or something I'm gonna start

682
02:41:22,229 --> 02:41:26,549
doing like math problems on stream. We're gonna talk about like logic problems. We're gonna talk

683
02:41:26,549 --> 02:41:32,120
about like life skills. All I see over here now is like serial killer. Pee. Drink his pee. I'm

684
02:41:32,120 --> 02:41:36,680
gonna drink his piss. I'm gonna put his piss in my mouth. Like I gotta like teach you guys stuff.

685
02:41:49,479 --> 02:41:52,680
He pooped his diaper. But diaper poo poo. Like I gotta teach you guys some things.

686
02:41:56,579 --> 02:41:59,940
But I don't think I can change the way an entire profession thinks about gender.

687
02:41:59,940 --> 02:42:03,379
If I get in the brilliant book of world records for most patients served,

688
02:42:03,379 --> 02:42:08,340
I think that would send a message that women are just as proficient if not more so than their male

689
02:42:08,340 --> 02:42:13,879
counterparts. All right. Weren't you literally a teacher? Where are you going? No I literally

690
02:42:13,879 --> 02:42:18,170
handed out worksheets and didn't know anything going on in the class. Oh no surgery takes a

691
02:42:18,170 --> 02:42:23,049
lot of time. I need you to fake multiple injuries so I can treat you faster than I normally could.

692
02:42:23,049 --> 02:42:25,610
It actually terrified me terrified me when a student had a question.

693
02:42:30,489 --> 02:42:36,250
It was so sad and it was so wholesome. They come up they'd be like oh I need help with this one.

694
02:42:37,190 --> 02:42:44,579
And I'd just be I feel like okay yeah I don't I don't know anything but you need help and I

695
02:42:44,579 --> 02:42:51,020
want someone to be able to teach you and help you. And I think I would say you know how about you

696
02:42:51,020 --> 02:42:56,139
try your best and try do what you can and when the teacher's back you'll be able to

697
02:42:56,139 --> 02:43:06,549
go back and forth with the teacher. But how do I do it? Well I mean I I know but I want to make

698
02:43:06,549 --> 02:43:11,989
sure that you know so you're prepared and I'm just here to make sure that you can figure it out on

699
02:43:11,989 --> 02:43:22,010
your own. I didn't listen to a single thing in that cut scene so I'm just gonna go pee.

700
02:43:22,649 --> 02:43:29,370
But anytime I'd say I'd hear the sound because I'd be looking down just gonna look at the desk and

701
02:43:30,090 --> 02:43:34,180
shifting papers around pretending I was an important adult you'd hear the

702
02:43:36,219 --> 02:43:40,950
of a chair moving back. I'd be sitting there going no no no no please don't come up here

703
02:43:40,950 --> 02:43:44,549
please don't come up here and tell me how to do algebra or like how to do like long division

704
02:43:44,549 --> 02:43:53,590
please god. And then then you'd hear a couple steps to the desk they're coming up here and

705
02:43:53,590 --> 02:43:59,290
they're gonna ask a question please don't please please ask anything else. Uh can I go to the

706
02:43:59,290 --> 02:44:04,969
bathroom? Yep oh absolutely I'll give you a hall pass for that. Come over here have a seat. Oh yeah

707
02:44:04,969 --> 02:44:10,569
let me give it a big signature on it. Oh Mr. Albertson here it is take that. I am a teacher

708
02:44:10,569 --> 02:44:16,379
go ahead. And you by the way you got five ten fifteen minutes whatever it takes go do what

709
02:44:16,379 --> 02:44:23,670
you need to do I can sign that I'm an adult. And I felt great I was like thank god it wasn't a

710
02:44:23,670 --> 02:44:39,799
question because you're just teaching a preschool. No I shouldn't teach at all. It was like a thing

711
02:44:39,799 --> 02:44:42,920
that I did because I was just trying to do something like that I thought was interesting.

712
02:44:42,920 --> 02:44:52,840
I was like oh that sounds like an interesting job. I mean I'll try that teach us something.

713
02:44:52,840 --> 02:44:58,940
Okay I do teach you guys things all the time I think. I feel like you guys have taken some

714
02:44:58,940 --> 02:45:03,940
things from this stream very important stuff. Of course you have. For instance one of the things

715
02:45:04,260 --> 02:45:10,500
you take from the stream is that holding your urine is not good. Your teacher has peed his pants

716
02:45:10,500 --> 02:45:17,049
like pee came out. So you take from the learning experience here you've learned that. That if you

717
02:45:17,049 --> 02:45:21,290
need to go you should go and you should not waste any time just do it get up there and use the

718
02:45:21,290 --> 02:45:45,129
bathroom. I'll be back. The game crashed. I don't know when I saved it but I think it was I think

719
02:45:45,129 --> 02:46:08,020
it was pretty recently. I think we're fine I'll be back. I didn't pee my pants. I'm a comedian.

720
02:46:08,020 --> 02:46:10,739
I'm a comedian. I tell jokes. That's what I do for a living. I'm a comedian.

721
02:46:11,620 --> 02:46:17,780
Come see me at the fucking funny factory okay. I'm there every Friday. I hope that I don't I don't

722
02:46:17,780 --> 02:49:53,000
actually do that goodbye. Kind of hot in this room right now. Teacher's gone for 15 minutes we can

723
02:49:53,000 --> 02:50:13,979
leave. I wasn't gone for 15 minutes. I'm here. All jokes aside I hope I still saw Jermad do stand up

724
02:50:13,979 --> 02:50:18,700
once. I went to the funny factory hoping to see my favorite streamer dish up some comedy. The entire

725
02:50:18,700 --> 02:50:23,020
time he just wouldn't stop talking about his uh penis. I guess he kept saying it like that. Nobody

726
02:50:23,020 --> 02:50:34,649
laughed. You know what you said there is is a sadly inaccurate because like jokes like oh my dick

727
02:50:34,649 --> 02:50:41,930
oh my oh my dick. The audience will be rolling. Let me tell you guys something about my dick.

728
02:50:42,649 --> 02:50:47,319
People just start laughing. We're just so much more high brow than that here.

729
02:50:57,079 --> 02:51:13,379
I'm shitting and screaming. Yeah that's much higher. Higher. What was that? I just breathed

730
02:51:13,379 --> 02:51:26,180
pretty hard out of my nose. I think you're right. Say happy birthday to uh some spinach.

731
02:51:26,180 --> 02:51:31,639
Something spinach. Happy birthday spinach. All right let's go back to what we're doing.

732
02:51:31,639 --> 02:51:40,920
We'll play some more Saints Row. By the way uh Sunday. Sunday is confirmed I'm playing uh

733
02:51:40,920 --> 02:51:45,799
Resident Evil 6 co-op with Salix. We're not going to beat the game. We're going to play it until we

734
02:51:45,799 --> 02:52:01,110
both complain enough that we both just leave. Are the course really? You know. You mind if I sleep?

735
02:52:01,110 --> 02:52:05,909
No go for it. I apologize if I wake you up when I scream or laugh really loud at a car accident.

736
02:52:06,629 --> 02:52:16,059
All right let's open the game back up. Which it crashed. Hopefully we didn't lose too much

737
02:52:16,059 --> 02:52:27,430
progress. I don't think we did. Resident Evil 6 is so bad that it's a good game. Yeah I played

738
02:52:27,430 --> 02:52:32,229
it once years ago. I was going to make a video on it but the game was so bad that I was like I

739
02:52:32,229 --> 02:52:37,700
don't even care. I don't want to play more than 40 minutes but we're going to stomach through it.

740
02:52:37,700 --> 02:52:54,940
We're going to force ourselves to do it. Uh good they're both exactly the same place. Um

741
02:52:54,940 --> 02:52:56,860
might as well just go for it right. We're right here.

742
02:53:13,770 --> 02:53:15,930
Insurance fraud oh you're right. I'll go back.

743
02:53:28,969 --> 02:53:31,610
This mask is skin grafted onto my face.

744
02:53:31,850 --> 02:53:42,870
You should upgrade your base.

745
02:53:56,389 --> 02:54:09,430
I've been streaming for three hours. Wow that's surprising. I didn't want to hurt anybody.

746
02:54:12,729 --> 02:54:14,729
Nothing. There's nothing on the radio.

747
02:54:14,729 --> 02:54:29,610
What you did now. That was me humming the whole time.

748
02:54:30,250 --> 02:54:45,780
Excuse me. Now what are you doing? Stop it. Don't don't make me do it.

749
02:54:46,819 --> 02:54:49,780
Don't make I'm a pirate. I know I'm a pirate. Don't make me look at that thing you wrote in

750
02:54:49,780 --> 02:54:54,020
chat. No what are you doing? Stop my Wellington. Stop that. What are you doing in my Wellington?

751
02:54:54,020 --> 02:55:00,500
Stop it. You know everybody hates it. I do too. I'm so fucked up I have to say it though. I'm

752
02:55:00,500 --> 02:55:08,629
a fucking goddamn. No what am I? I like impulsively have to do something that I see. What is it called?

753
02:55:09,430 --> 02:55:34,250
A monkey? You're a sadist? All right we have to. Oh it's an earnest level threat. Orange threat

754
02:55:34,250 --> 02:56:14,739
level is that what is that? Okay I see a guy like this walking around. I'm what the fuck is going

755
02:56:14,739 --> 02:56:37,690
on? What the fuck? Jesus Christ. Eat eat eat eat eat eat drink eat eat eat something. Eat eat

756
02:56:37,690 --> 02:56:49,049
something. Eat something. Eat something. What the fuck? I it's just shocking to me. I don't even

757
02:56:49,049 --> 02:57:14,329
take a fucking anything. I can't even walk. I didn't god damn it. I didn't want to. I wanted

758
02:57:14,329 --> 02:57:25,430
to right click. Right not. I wanted to right trigger. Oh my fucking god. I'm fucking leaving

759
02:57:25,430 --> 02:57:46,790
this mission. Oh my god. Is it like body armor? Don't right. Don't left trigger. Please watch out.

760
02:57:47,430 --> 02:58:13,270
Please. Yeah please watch out. Please god. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Please. Put you

761
02:58:13,270 --> 02:58:30,360
motherfucker. Put down. Put him down. Put them down. Put them. I was trying to melee. I was

762
02:58:30,360 --> 02:58:34,360
trying to melee. I was trying to melee. I was trying to melee. I was trying to melee. I was I

763
02:58:34,360 --> 02:58:38,979
thought it was melee. I thought it was melee. Melee. Melee. I was trying to melee. Oh my god.

764
02:58:38,979 --> 02:58:47,450
I was trying to melee. I thought it was melee. It's not. I'm so fucking sorry. I was trying to

765
02:58:47,450 --> 02:59:09,379
do the melee attack. Get me out of here. Oh my god. I was trying to go up and do it. Where are

766
02:59:09,379 --> 02:59:36,649
we? What? How are we driving around like this? Will you please get. Okay. All right. We got him.

767
02:59:36,649 --> 02:59:43,319
No we didn't. This is going to explode. Isn't it? Don't worry. You're playing a game. I don't. I

768
02:59:43,319 --> 02:59:56,889
don't want to die. I don't want to hurt anybody. We win. They're not real. I die. I don't hurt

769
02:59:56,889 --> 03:00:13,530
anybody. He thinks it's real. It's not. Hello. What happened? You've run over probably 500 people.

770
03:00:13,530 --> 03:00:24,090
Why do you. I went to the airport to save. I can't. Once I saw the leader of the saints making a move

771
03:00:24,090 --> 03:00:30,360
towards the terminal. I made my way to the plane so I could evacuate your father. His entourage

772
03:00:30,360 --> 03:00:37,959
willingly gave their lives to ensure safety. What happens when the matrix happens? No. Your

773
03:00:37,959 --> 03:00:41,799
father made it quite clear he doesn't wish to speak to you. Anything you have to say to him

774
03:00:41,799 --> 03:00:57,850
will go through me. Sayonara. Oh the fucking McRiddler. Yeah. The McRiddler is a fucking

775
03:00:57,850 --> 03:01:26,250
menace. Jerma has overdosed on normal pills. What do you mean? What does that mean?

776
03:01:26,969 --> 03:01:35,979
What does that mean? I don't even know what that means. The McRiddler is a terrorist. No.

777
03:01:35,979 --> 03:01:42,229
The McRiddler is a chaotic good character. Okay. Like every other character that anyone has ever

778
03:01:42,229 --> 03:01:47,670
made. Every single person's chaotic good. Nobody wants to be lawful good. Nobody wants to be lawful

779
03:01:47,670 --> 03:01:51,270
neutral. Nobody wants to be neutral. Everybody's chaotic good. I'm chaotic good. I'm a good person

780
03:01:51,270 --> 03:02:12,469
but I'm on my own rules and I'm kind of crazy and I do crazy things. Is this a customer? I was

781
03:02:12,469 --> 03:02:28,309
waiting for him to get out of the way but I don't care. You're faithful to good boy. Yeah. Where is

782
03:02:28,309 --> 03:02:41,540
this customer? Yeah good we went over this before. Good boy but a bad guy. You can be a bad guy and

783
03:02:41,540 --> 03:03:03,750
a good boy and uh-uh. What's the difference? Slow and steady. Not this again please. How am I supposed

784
03:03:03,750 --> 03:03:16,950
to get there in a minute? This is a this is ten dollars. Did you want to drive in a circle?

785
03:03:26,389 --> 03:03:36,139
Hold on. I gotta read this. What are you saying? Remember the McRiddler was only chaotic good for

786
03:03:36,139 --> 03:03:42,469
one writer's run back in 1972 to 1974 and it wasn't even that good. The definitive version of

787
03:03:42,469 --> 03:03:48,389
this character has existed for over 50 years and no one agrees that a two-year run has any bearing

788
03:03:48,389 --> 03:03:55,290
on who he was made to be okay? Just because your uncle wrote the run doesn't make it right. Oh

789
03:03:55,290 --> 03:04:04,540
really? Uh so the Dark Knight trilogy considered to be the best run of Batman ever and we don't

790
03:04:04,860 --> 03:04:17,059
say that though. Everything no. Everything else is is is the right one right? You're excused. Game

791
03:04:17,059 --> 03:04:33,139
crashed. Good thing I saved it right there. I wonder how um the new Batman movie will be. I feel like

792
03:04:33,139 --> 03:04:43,159
it's gonna be pretty good. I didn't watch Ernest Saves Christmas yet. Am I allowed to be here? You

793
03:04:43,159 --> 03:04:58,870
have until the 25th. So you got plenty of time. The McRiddler is the worst of the rat man's rogues

794
03:04:58,870 --> 03:05:16,149
gallery. Yeah you got plenty of time. You have the whole month of December. You're good but this

795
03:05:16,149 --> 03:05:34,360
has something happening outside. All right insurance fraud right? Are these guys on my team?

796
03:05:40,180 --> 03:06:01,670
Oh my Jesus Christ. Where are they going? Don't shoot the gun. Did I kill the guy in the front

797
03:06:01,670 --> 03:06:12,420
seat? Oh wait they didn't see me steal this car. Does that mean that? Of course you did.

798
03:06:14,540 --> 03:06:21,020
I didn't think I could roll up in the car they were just in as a guy that wasn't a police officer

799
03:06:21,100 --> 03:06:25,020
and did what? They I I'm not gonna get in trouble for this. They don't know it was me.

800
03:06:25,739 --> 03:06:38,340
What am I smoking? What's what am I talking about? All right where was that? I was over here.

801
03:06:38,340 --> 03:06:46,569
Oh I'm just an officer except I'm the McRiddler. If the McRiddler pulls up in a cop car he took it.

802
03:06:46,569 --> 03:06:53,299
He's not a police officer. All the normal pills. What are you talking about? Why you keep saying

803
03:06:53,299 --> 03:07:14,700
that? Where's the insurance fraud? There's too many things on the map. It's the crutches right?

804
03:07:14,700 --> 03:07:31,100
Where are they? Where are they? Museum district. Oh it's because okay it's because the game crashed

805
03:07:31,100 --> 03:07:41,989
before it saved. I understand. What's this McDonald's car? What is this? Holy shit I want that.

806
03:07:42,629 --> 03:07:51,100
The McRiddler has to have this car. This is I'm gonna I have to save this one.

807
03:07:52,569 --> 03:08:11,049
Holy moly. I gotta go to a garage right now. Where's the nearest garage? Up here. What's

808
03:08:11,049 --> 03:08:22,540
this place? Oh a penthouse loft? Where should I save it? I'm gonna buy this place whatever it is.

809
03:08:22,540 --> 03:08:37,180
It's downtown left. Let's go. Don't mess this car up. Remember you're not a fan of the McRiddler

810
03:08:37,180 --> 03:08:55,370
unless you know his whatever. That's really funny but I don't even want to read it. I swear to

811
03:08:55,370 --> 03:09:02,139
god some of you guys are the funniest motherfuckers ever. Everyone talks about chat like oh chat's like

812
03:09:02,139 --> 03:09:10,020
yeah fuck fuck chat chat's like oh fucked up I don't like it. A lot of you are right? But man

813
03:09:10,020 --> 03:09:19,000
there's a huge percentage of you guys that are fucking absolutely hysterical. $50,000 god damn

814
03:09:19,000 --> 03:09:28,620
it. I'm not going to tell you the the percentage that I think that is because I don't want you else

815
03:09:28,620 --> 03:09:39,399
to get your egos inflated. I can't afford that. What can I afford? Can I afford this one? This is

816
03:09:39,399 --> 03:10:08,500
a penthouse. I highly doubt that. We're just gonna bring it back here. No crashes at all please.

817
03:10:09,299 --> 03:10:28,729
I really liked Nolan's Batman. Yeah okay on a rewatch recently it was like yeah this is still

818
03:10:28,729 --> 03:10:54,420
really good. I have some issues with it. I think it's probably the best version of Batman although

819
03:10:54,420 --> 03:10:57,540
I do like the Michael Keaton Batman. I think that was still really good too.

820
03:10:57,540 --> 03:11:03,819
It's tough. Danny DeVito as the penguin is I don't think you can ever get something that's better.

821
03:11:14,840 --> 03:11:40,020
Dude scratch this car. I scratch your life out. Just make sure you know that. Get out of the way.

822
03:11:40,020 --> 03:11:58,870
I don't want you to don't smudge up the paint. All right we made it. Okay bring the car here

823
03:11:58,870 --> 03:12:12,309
into the garage. Yes yes. So why am I zooming in there? I don't know. I did not mean to do that.

824
03:12:12,309 --> 03:12:19,399
So will this always be here? Okay if this explodes outside somewhere will it still be in

825
03:12:19,399 --> 03:12:30,969
this garage? Oh that's amazing. Thank god. That's incredible. All right so now let's go over here.

826
03:12:30,969 --> 03:13:03,290
This way right? Yeah now I can just drive around like an asshole. Perfect. Geez it's fast. I'm

827
03:13:03,290 --> 03:13:25,079
going through the bottom of the car. Saved. I just saved. I did didn't I? Hot dog Batmobile.

828
03:13:29,379 --> 03:13:34,969
It's not even the right one. Wait it's not the destination never mind. Not the destination.

829
03:13:35,530 --> 03:14:09,940
Clean. Very clean. Being chat spam a copy pasta.

830
03:14:11,899 --> 03:14:15,139
Would you like to know the percentage of the funny people?

831
03:14:23,319 --> 03:14:34,459
All right let's actually do this this time. I'm gonna fight to the death for the Hamburg Larini.

832
03:14:34,459 --> 03:14:36,979
It's not bad.

833
03:14:50,920 --> 03:14:55,879
Most patients served. I think that would send a message that women are just as proficient if

834
03:14:55,879 --> 03:15:02,790
not more so than their male counterparts. All right. Where are you going? You said you were

835
03:15:02,790 --> 03:15:06,309
planning on treating more patients so I figured you wanted me to hurt some people. Oh god no.

836
03:15:06,309 --> 03:15:10,870
Surgery takes a lot of time. I need you to fake multiple injuries so I can treat you faster than

837
03:15:10,870 --> 03:15:17,909
I normally could. Fake multiple injuries? Does that make sense? Just checking.

838
03:15:18,870 --> 03:15:28,870
Throw yourself into harm's way to earn cash. Okay so just to beat myself up. Where's my car?

839
03:15:28,870 --> 03:15:38,809
There it is. I keep hearing bottle rockets go off. Been like that the whole game. I haven't

840
03:15:38,809 --> 03:16:15,319
ever mentioned it. Friendly. Friendly. Friendly. Friendly. Friendly. Friendly. To take a dive?

841
03:16:16,200 --> 03:16:39,700
What does it what do you mean press? I have to press to take a dive. Oh shit this is time

842
03:16:39,700 --> 03:16:56,389
limit. Okay so am I to do it now? Do it now. Do it now. I'm gonna go so fast I'm gonna go

843
03:16:56,389 --> 03:17:29,399
right into a wall. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. That doesn't count? Why are we all doing the same thing?

844
03:17:36,889 --> 03:18:03,260
Oh shit oh you you fall into stuff. I get it. Oh my god this is amazing. That's so stupid. What

845
03:18:03,260 --> 03:18:26,309
about hold on. Nice. I got plenty of time. I have an idea. I'm gonna go in the supercar. I'm gonna

846
03:18:26,309 --> 03:19:02,010
go a million miles per hour and throw myself out of the map. Does this count? Oh shit. That's

847
03:19:02,010 --> 03:19:14,840
actually not a bad idea. I have to get some air though. How do I get air? That's a good question.

848
03:19:14,840 --> 03:19:35,639
Shit. It's gonna be close. Come on get over here. I'm not gonna get it. I don't okay. Now I know

849
03:19:35,639 --> 03:19:50,940
what they want me to do. I get it. I understand. You need to bounce off of cars. Okay well I didn't

850
03:19:50,940 --> 03:20:03,860
get it. I'll try it again. I understand what they want. Okay all right. I need I want my good car.

851
03:20:03,860 --> 03:20:30,840
This will do. The more hits you chain the more you get. How do you bounce from car to car? Drive

852
03:20:30,920 --> 03:20:58,709
head into head on to a car. Will I fly out of the windshield? I think it's gonna start. You idiot.

853
03:20:58,709 --> 03:21:24,360
You can move around while you're rag-dulled. Okay. Fuck. Motorcycle. That's better. That's a

854
03:21:24,360 --> 03:21:49,620
good idea. That doesn't even do anything. Works better from near a fast road. I fucking can't do

855
03:21:49,620 --> 03:22:18,579
this. Don't drive. That kind of worked. Just go to the highway. Will that be too far away? Stop

856
03:22:18,579 --> 03:22:23,959
driving. But the cars are not going fast enough to make me do anything. Juggle yourself in an

857
03:22:23,959 --> 03:22:31,909
intersection. Okay hold on. I gotta like get this down first. All right so there's a bunch of cars

858
03:22:31,909 --> 03:22:54,649
here. Fucking god I jumped over it. How the fuck am I missing that? Come here. Oh come on. Oh this

859
03:22:54,649 --> 03:23:13,299
is gonna be fun. I get it. I get it. Here we go. Here we go. Come on. These people need to get out

860
03:23:13,299 --> 03:23:25,780
of the way. They're actually making them go crazy. This is actually good. This is good for me. Hey

861
03:23:25,780 --> 03:23:54,299
what? I didn't count. How is this not counting? Oh you have to die first. Okay this intersection's

862
03:23:54,299 --> 03:24:18,500
fucked up. There's no more cars. I need more spawns. Spawns come on. Oh hurry up you fucking

863
03:24:18,500 --> 03:24:31,959
slow asshole. Go. Run. I didn't even. Hurry up and drive. Oh my god I'm not gonna do it am I?

864
03:24:31,959 --> 03:24:38,489
I want to get in the car and drive. No one's driving. Nobody is driving their cars.

865
03:24:39,129 --> 03:24:55,930
Let's do it in the marked location. All right I'll get it this time. Let's go. Hurry up. I know. I get

866
03:24:55,930 --> 03:25:15,860
it. Just go to the highway. Ignore the location. Where the fuck is this taking me? Where do I have

867
03:25:15,860 --> 03:25:22,299
to go? The suburbs. Is there a highway that I can do that's right? I could do right here maybe.

868
03:25:22,299 --> 03:25:34,780
Will this count? Any highway? It has to be in this location though. It can't be over here.

869
03:25:34,780 --> 03:25:45,879
Jump off of a building. Wait I can do it right here? No I can't. Location doesn't matter. The timer's

870
03:25:45,879 --> 03:25:54,739
not going. Yeah go to the city. What are you talking about? Go to the site. Chat. It's wrong. Again.

871
03:25:55,750 --> 03:26:12,280
Look at that. Always. You have to do it in the district. Chat is lying to you. Yeah yeah yeah yeah

925
03:40:32,950 --> 03:40:58,780
oh the ambulance would have been huge oh yeah it's gonna explode i think it already did come here

926
03:40:58,780 --> 03:41:35,989

930
03:42:25,159 --> 03:42:31,000
again we get a car drive to that place build up the adrenaline and then go for it

931
03:42:37,239 --> 03:42:42,120

932
03:42:43,079 --> 03:43:07,479
how far away is this not that far okay go this just looks like a burger king or mcdonald's

973
03:57:31,659 --> 03:57:40,020
physics is that shit what i bounced over you bounced over the car on the second hop yeah

03:57:41,780 --> 03:58:22,809
come on go you all these cars are going so slow this is a terrible place to be this is it come on

975
03:58:22,809 --> 03:58:39,219
this place sucks like this this part this place actually sucks it's too shitty of a location

976
03:58:39,219 --> 03:58:48,219
because they have to all break so this is like the end of the highway this is an awful place to do

977
03:58:48,219 --> 03:59:03,399
this i gotta go the other way on the highway i got a plan i have to get in the car and drive all the

978
03:59:03,399 --> 03:59:28,520
way over there good i want to punch the algorithm in the face like spawn some cars i was running oh

979
03:59:29,479 --> 04:00:00,950
there they are how am i not in this please just bring something together you're gonna give

980
04:00:00,950 --> 04:00:09,219
yourself a migraine no i'm okay i have to get like 200 000 fucking points right now or it's

983
04:00:31,579 --> 04:00:49,110
that happening i'm so fucking pissed right now i'm furious somebody hit me this way but there's no

984
04:00:49,110 --> 04:01:10,219
cars that spawn this way come on come on hit me again stop changing direction i'm i weigh like

985
04:01:10,219 --> 04:01:27,780
600 pounds it's gonna move me i love they avoid me too this is stupid you should go ragdoll to a

986
04:01:27,780 --> 04:01:37,690
new adrenaline zone they're like they're too far away the problem is the game spawns like 10 cars

987
04:01:37,690 --> 04:01:52,180
in a row and then you just sit there for a minute game crashed i was saving it after every mission

988
04:01:52,180 --> 04:02:18,389
though that's okay right it's okay right the bridges on the highway is the best place to do

989
04:02:18,389 --> 04:02:40,629
it in the game uh this is accurate right just fuck the circle cars infinitely spawn on the highway

990
04:02:40,709 --> 04:02:45,639
one problem with the highway is where's the entrance to the highway the gps in this game

991
04:02:45,639 --> 04:02:49,399
literally may as well just be like a two-year-old yelling fucking their favorite song in the back

992
04:02:49,399 --> 04:03:03,979
seat so the gps does not have any idea where to go where's the highway entrance yellow is the real

993
04:03:04,540 --> 04:03:28,500
tracks this is a highway how do i get onto this oh my god uh i'm all right i'm gonna go do a mission

994
04:03:28,500 --> 04:03:49,670
i'm gonna eat the i'm gonna eat the controller if i don't i gotta change it up what about the

995
04:03:49,670 --> 04:04:07,139

999
04:05:41,989 --> 04:05:53,299

1066
04:27:12,790 --> 04:27:28,979
nobody move eating the shell is a delicacy we talked about this before i think but i gotta

1067
04:27:28,979 --> 04:27:34,709
make sure i get this in my brain reiterate it there was a gum that i don't know if i was lied to when

1068
04:27:34,709 --> 04:27:40,540
i was a little kid there was a gum that you were supposed to chew with the wrapper on because it

1069
04:27:40,540 --> 04:27:50,870
made it better am i crazy it was back in like the mid 90s i'm just gonna quit gaming for i'm

1070
04:27:50,870 --> 04:27:56,899
gonna quit i literally quit i'm crazy i quit streaming i quit forever like i need i've how

1071
04:27:56,899 --> 04:28:09,129
could that is it possible it's not even possible to do that as like a game or a live streamer

1072
04:28:09,129 --> 04:28:22,979
okay um where are we that was a myth but what was the gum it was a specific gum because it

1073
04:28:22,979 --> 04:28:28,219
had like little crystals in it i don't think it was stride if there was there were crystals

1074
04:28:28,219 --> 04:28:38,860
it was a little like flavor crystals not fruit stripe well i don't think it was an original

1075
04:28:38,860 --> 04:28:48,120
stride i don't think so it was flavor crystals and it wasn't stride hey i'll tell the story for the

1076
04:28:48,120 --> 04:28:54,500
new people what i used to um i thought that was too bad guys i used to lie to the dentist

1077
04:28:54,500 --> 04:29:02,649
and i was i thought i thought i was being really healthy and really really smart because nobody

1078
04:29:02,649 --> 04:29:06,250
who the fuck flosses right and they were like oh so you've been flossing yeah of course i have

1079
04:29:06,250 --> 04:29:11,420

1080
04:29:11,420 --> 04:29:16,489

1081
04:29:16,489 --> 04:29:23,750
cleaned your tooth and shit so i would tell the dentist that i've been chewing trident and they

1108
04:35:08,840 --> 04:35:18,520
story okay so i was taking so auto sits on the couch we hang out he's like oh let's watch tv

04:35:25,900 --> 04:35:29,340
and i bring him up to bed right like okay it's time let's bring him up to let's go to bed

1111
04:35:29,979 --> 04:35:35,180
so i cradle him i pick him up really gently i curl him over so his face is kind of i'm holding like

1112
04:35:35,180 --> 04:35:40,060
a baby and he's up looking at me with his face kind of pointing at me he's like eyes are a little

1113
04:35:40,060 --> 04:35:48,779
groggy right so i picked him up like okay let's go and at the same time i breathed in i was like

1114
04:35:49,900 --> 04:35:55,209
and he and blew his burp into my mouth and i inhaled it and it was the worst thing that's

1115
04:35:55,209 --> 04:36:01,930
ever happened i think in my whole life it was it i i almost puked instantly i was but i obviously

1116
04:36:01,930 --> 04:36:05,770
i don't want to like i want to make sure i hold him and i was like i don't want to you know cause

1117
04:36:05,770 --> 04:36:09,369
a problem so i was like holding him very very steadily but at the same time i was like oh my

1118
04:36:09,369 --> 04:36:14,729
god i'm gonna puke so i like got him up into i put him down in the bed and he was like nice and

1119
04:36:14,729 --> 04:36:20,569
comfortable and i almost puked like three times it was seriously it tasted and smelled like beyond

1120
04:36:20,569 --> 04:36:25,849
burgers and i love beyond burgers and it sucks because now i can like never eat it again because

1121
04:36:25,849 --> 04:36:31,990
that's all i'm gonna think about is my dog burping down into my lungs it's disgusting what is this

1122
04:36:33,290 --> 04:36:48,099

1123
04:36:48,099 --> 04:37:00,040
they're great oh nice 27 000 but something about the exact combination of the moment

1124
04:37:00,599 --> 04:37:05,240
maybe it was something that was in the air too i don't know i have no idea it was awful

04:37:39,540 --> 04:37:46,650
while watching that's important to know unless it's like candy because who gives nothing is

1128
04:37:46,650 --> 04:37:51,259
going to gross you out from eating candy if you're eating a bowl of spaghetti yes but if you're

1129
04:37:51,259 --> 04:37:57,029

1179
04:52:46,919 --> 04:53:21,419
i didn't make it up i need more moves eating these pretty quick in fact you mentioned adam

1180
04:53:21,419 --> 04:53:28,200
sandler and i am almost certain that there is a character in billy madison from the movie that

1181
04:53:28,200 --> 04:53:37,900
movie where the principal is just this guy the principal of of billy madison is the character

1182
04:53:37,900 --> 04:53:53,430
i'm playing his name was the blob he had a purple mask three two one the revolting blob

1183

he was a former pro wrestler called the blob yeah you know i haven't seen those movies in a long

1184
04:54:06,709 --> 04:54:13,830
time it's been years i wonder if my rose colored glasses whatever are showing but i remember those

1185
04:54:13,830 --> 04:54:20,680
movies being funny they were actually humorous this part where a dog the funniest part of the

1186
04:54:20,680 --> 04:54:27,799
whole movie for me was adam sandler's watching a tv show and it's like a family sitcom and there's

1187
04:54:27,799 --> 04:54:32,360
a real just regular dog that like they got to like they gave it like a treat or something or

1188
04:54:32,439 --> 04:54:37,880
they like barked on camera and they dubbed over it and the dog goes no so speak for yourself

1189
04:54:37,880 --> 04:54:42,200
moron and he starts laughing hysterically at it and i thought it was the funniest thing i'd ever

1190
04:54:42,200 --> 04:54:59,029
seen when i was like 15 i did a podcast last year where i watched all 62 adam sandler films

1192
04:55:11,349 --> 04:55:28,810
everybody's just so negative i thought it was funny if i remember he's made a ton of movies

1193
04:55:29,689 --> 04:55:36,490
one i don't think i don't think there's 62 adam sandler movies let me see if i can name
