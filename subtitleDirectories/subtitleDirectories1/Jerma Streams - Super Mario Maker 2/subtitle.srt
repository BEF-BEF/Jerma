00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:09,259
Good afternoon. How are you doing? This moment's going down in history.

2
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:19,289
It's the second time I've ever sworn off a Mario Maker game in one day.

3
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:23,050
I got a lot of heat for this one. People say in German, you said

4
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:26,969
Mario Maker, you said you've never played ever again and you you hated it.

5
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:31,050
I didn't hate the game, but I mean I did say that, but this is Mario, this

6
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,009
is a different game. This is Mario Maker 2.

7
00:00:34,009 --> 00:00:44,789
Not the same game. Yeah okay so I swore this is a bit different video game.

8
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:52,969
It's the same game. No it's not. They added Super Mario 3D world levels.

9
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:59,640
Sorry so much research you've done. Wow.

10
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:08,170
What really? I was under the assumption that everybody like loved

11
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:11,209
Super Mario. What happened? What happened?

12
00:01:11,209 --> 00:02:11,770
Nobody likes Super Mario anymore? All right give me one second.

13
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:15,080
All right so we're gonna do this for a little while.

14
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,280
And I don't know if it's fun. We'll keep doing it. If not then

15
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:26,759
I got no plan man you know. He came back. Yeah of course I came back.

16
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:34,229
So let's go. I mean why not right? Here it is.

17
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:39,560
I've only got 335 seconds remaining. Oh wait I have to do an audio test

18
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,629
with you guys. Hold on let me just test the audio.

19
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:49,240
Make sure this is synced up. All right ready?

20
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,889
I'm gonna jump and I'm gonna grab the coin. Ready?

21
00:02:52,889 --> 00:02:59,689
Now got. How we doing? Jump jump jump jump jump.

22
00:02:59,689 --> 00:03:12,460
Are we synced? I think that should be good. Should be is the right

23
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:19,340
question. My voice is low. Hold on. I did do some messing around with my

24
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:22,889
audio. So let me see if I fuck something up.

25
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:28,069
Better? I think I think that's better. I don't think I was messing around

26
00:03:28,069 --> 00:03:35,430
with audio bits. I should be louder now. All right

27
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:40,120
So anyways I don't I don't know anything about this.

28
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:46,020
I didn't watch the direct. They did a whole direct about here comes

29
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,379
Super Mario Maker 2. Get excited for it.

30
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:52,949
I didn't watch it. All I know is that they just made another one.

31
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:58,180
Is there anything I need to know? This is yeah this is all fresh to me.

32
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:07,460
Completely fresh. He doesn't know. Well I opened this and I made an

33
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,020
account. I ain't gonna make a level by the

34
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,659
way guys. You think you're gonna get that on this stream? You are out of

35
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:23,110
mind. So there's a campaign. Should I play the campaign?

36
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:40,889
There is a campaign. Well it wasn't easy but we finally finished the castle.

37
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:50,569
Yeah out of this this is messing with my immersion. Mario's a plumber. He's

38
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:54,259
not a construction worker. Couldn't have done it without you

39
00:04:54,259 --> 00:05:06,060
Chief Princess Peach. He'll be thrilled. Mario's not a construction worker. He's a carpenter. He's a plumber.

40
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,060
They changed that. Yes he was a carpenter back in the in the in the

41
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:19,560
original but this is 2019 Mario. The resort reset rocket lying around.

42
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,089
It wasn't me Chief. Pretty sure it was

43
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:34,779
the dog. Is it a dog? New character. Oh it's the dog. I can't make a name

44
00:05:34,779 --> 00:05:41,459
up right now. It's Marshmallow. No that's like a

45
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:45,459
it's a dude that like makes like EDM music.

46
00:05:54,300 --> 00:06:11,060
Get off the button. What the hell is going on? Okay see this is why I'm a cat

47
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:16,699
person. All right so all that hard work just

48
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:21,990
gone. See this is why I'm a cat person.

49
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:25,269
I can't believe it. Princess Peach's castle.

50
00:06:25,269 --> 00:06:29,670
We have to rebuild it but we've used up our entire budget. This is

51
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:35,639
really bad. Oh too bad you can't say like

52
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:39,930
your problem. Leave it to me I'll handle it.

53
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:46,170
I guess I'll handle it. Of course why did I think of that? You can collect

54
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:51,699
enough coins for us to rebuild. With help we can make an even bigger

55
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:55,699
and better castle than before. Go see if the task master can scrape

56
00:06:55,699 --> 00:07:03,560
together a few jobs for you. I need funding. Mario secures funding.

57
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,220
Okay I wasn't eavesdropping or anything but I kind of sort of

58
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:10,740
overheard your entire conversation with Chief.

59
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:15,750
Lucky for us I got a line on some jobs from around the world.

60
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:19,509
If you complete enough jobs we should be able to make enough coins to rebuild

61
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:23,750
the whole castle. I gotta say no one you're gonna

62
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,949
single-handedly fund this entire construction effort really takes the

63
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:31,269
pressure off me you know. Okay no time to waste check out this

64
00:07:31,269 --> 00:07:36,860
job from someone named uh Goomba Lover. Most of these clients

65
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:40,459
don't use their real names. I don't ask too many questions

66
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:47,480
as long as they cough up the coins. Got like what would this

67
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:51,240
okay never mind. Downhill battle 100 coins.

68
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,600
I made a course full of Goombas. First one to get the gold pole

69
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:59,000
gets paid. Here's a tip tilt down on the downward slopes to wipe out the

70
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:06,569
Goombas. My Goomba Lover. This guy get off

71
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:10,230
to this? Is that what's going on here? I don't

72
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:24,620
understand. All right let's do it. I'm already big can I get a big guy?

73
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:30,920
Yeah I can. Oh it's been so long since I've played Super Mario.

74
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:44,100
What's what I believe in you. What do you mean? This is probably the

75
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,940
best song that they've ever made either.

76
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:52,870
Either I mean ever. So do I have to collect the coins or

77
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:56,789
do you just get the coins? That's a secret hold on.

78
00:08:56,789 --> 00:09:03,000
No wait okay this is the panic button. Every time you get a star you have to

79
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,789
go panic mode. If I die on the first level I'm going

80
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:11,429
to stop playing again. Just make sure I want you guys to be very aware of

81
00:09:11,429 --> 00:09:16,070
that. If I die on the first fucking Goomba

82
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:24,789
Lover level I'm going to... okay we're good.

83
00:09:24,789 --> 00:09:32,039
You can't die. Yes you can if I walk into the Goombas twice.

84
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:39,769
Collected payment. Did they take this shit from

85
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:46,039
Mario Odyssey? We have to get like a currency and pay?

86
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,559
All right so let's play the foundation. Do I have enough money?

87
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:56,379
Did you get some coins? Yes I do. Oh you do. It does add to your balance.

88
00:09:56,379 --> 00:10:01,049
Mario Odyssey invented currency. No but I like how you had to pay the

89
00:10:01,049 --> 00:10:05,289
currency to make the ship better and fly. I have to pay the currency to

90
00:10:05,289 --> 00:10:13,240
build the castle back. Yeah okay. Choose foundation to put in

91
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,700
the work order. Do I get to make my own castle?

92
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:21,929
You sure about that? No I'm not sure. Just keep it leveled.

93
00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:30,679
Let's work out of a tent from now on. Do I have to tap the screen really fast?

94
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:36,340
Construction has started on the foundation. We'll keep working while

95
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:40,549
you're off making moola. So get out there and do some more

96
00:10:40,549 --> 00:10:48,179
jobs. I got three new jobs for you. All right a word of advice from old

97
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:51,700
Taskmaster Toad. You can run the same job as many

98
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,899
times as you want. You won't get paid for it again.

99
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:58,870
But you get coins that you pick up.

100
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:03,350
Now back to work. Some new jobs just came in.

101
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:07,110
On-off switch research expedition. These are these are

102
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:11,929
I wouldn't eat here. All right on-off switch.

103
00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:17,019
Might as well just do them in order. Hmm the on-off switch. No one really

104
00:11:17,019 --> 00:11:21,740
knows how it actually works. Wireless protocols. Ancient magic. Get

105
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,820
to the end of this course and reward you handsomely.

106
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:30,169
Dr. Gizmo. Good luck out there big red.

107
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:44,870
This is a new style. Hold on on. Oh that's how the on-off switch works

108
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:56,440
guys. In just a case you didn't know. One two three. All right I'm done

109
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,679
playing. I'm gonna like stream myself eat a burrito.

110
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:13,259
Like I don't think I want to do this anymore. Um that was quick.

111
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:21,129
Trap him. Oh fuck I can't die here otherwise I have to fucking delete my

112
00:12:21,129 --> 00:12:25,210
account.

113
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:33,110
Do you guys think that that's a joke?

114
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:41,019
Okay when I when I'm done. When I'm when I'm fucking done and I mean done

115
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:44,919
with Twitch YouTube don't matter right.

116
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:47,960
I'm gonna do that one day. I'm just gonna be like you know what yeah if I

117
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,440
die here I'm deleting my account and I'm gonna die and I'm gonna delete

118
00:12:50,440 --> 00:13:00,299
my account and you'll never see me again.

119
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:07,750
Got him. Well I need those coins. Too icy.

120
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:16,870
What's happening right now? Why is everything this is happening today?

121
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:26,600
You guys are acting like I'm doing this in an hour. Hold on wait.

122
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,799
There's a secret down here I think. This is a secret.

123
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:42,570
Fuck I can't get it. Super coin. How do I get down there?

124
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:50,360
I'm gonna keep it off. I found it. Check this out.

125
00:13:50,360 --> 00:14:04,570
Now it's not blocked. Now it. Wait. Oops. It's all right. I. Now.

126
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:28,870
Let's go. Can't go up. This is gonna be weird. Check this out.

127
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:36,120
No no no no. Stay in there. Can it just kill me? Will I get teleporter exited

128
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:53,590
if I stand there? Let's test it. Nope. Got it. I'm gonna do that every

129
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:56,070
single time. So you may as well leave now if you

130
00:14:56,070 --> 00:15:11,669
don't want to hear that again. You're not gonna win enough for that

131
00:15:11,669 --> 00:15:15,590
to happen. So I asked this in the pre-stream chat.

132
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:22,169
Did they get rid of the 100 Mario thing? Is there still expert difficulty?

133
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:27,690
Is it still regular? Just normal? How did they do that?

134
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:34,759
I need two more. I kind of like this. What's going on? Once we finish the

135
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:37,320
foundation the real work begins. This is kind of fun.

136
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:48,409
All right so we got hello 3D world. I've played at all these cute trees in my

137
00:15:48,409 --> 00:15:51,529
garden. Would someone try reaching the goal by climbing the trees with up?

138
00:15:51,529 --> 00:15:54,250
I haven't weeded the garden in a while but if the piranha plants give

139
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,570
you trouble just stomp them into the dirt.

140
00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:03,320
Okay. You don't have to read this. It's Mario.

141
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:09,960
Why wouldn't I read it? I'm just gonna skip it?

142
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:14,500
Why wouldn't I read that? Did I just say

143
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:20,070
I am so in love with this teaser of Diablo 3

144
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:23,110
image screenshot here? Some of you guys are gonna know what I'm talking

145
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:31,929
about. Stomp them, right? How do you stomp?

146
00:16:31,929 --> 00:16:44,549
Like that. Oops. What the fuck am I on?

147
00:16:44,549 --> 00:16:50,070
It sounds like you got it. I don't need to explain everything.

148
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:53,350
People get mad at me when I explain the reference. They go we know we know

149
00:16:53,350 --> 00:17:04,099
and I go what the fuck? Climb the tree.

150
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:14,900
That's cool. Can I do the double triple jump?

151
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:20,329
So I'm a casual fucking fan. Not even. I'm not even a fan.

152
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:24,329
Some people would probably mad at me knowing that this is the

153
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:27,690
the last Mario game that I actually opened and played

154
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:32,970
was Mario Maker 1. On top of that before that

155
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:38,890
you have to go back to Mario Galaxy 1.

156
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:45,660
Am I a cat? Oh the internet's gonna love this one.

157
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:53,380
Can I do anything else with the cat? You just scratch.

158
00:17:53,380 --> 00:18:10,099
Wait a minute. How do I get that? Whatever.

159
00:18:10,099 --> 00:18:15,660
Hey big bro if you're having trouble with the course use some assist parts.

160
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:26,460
Oh shit there he is. It's Luigi. He's showing up already. I can't wait

161
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:34,259
till the next time I die and it goes don't cry. Give the controller to your

162
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:44,380
older brother. I can't do Mario. Don't worry don't cry.

163
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:54,980
Okay I gotta attack that with the cat.

164
00:18:54,980 --> 00:19:00,630
I didn't know I could do that. I didn't know. When was this? Have they ever

165
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:11,109
used this suit before? Wait you can climb walls as the cat?

166
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:30,579
What? I need you. No I want to jump. I want to jump his head. Hold on.

167
00:19:30,579 --> 00:19:36,140
You can sprint faster as the cat too. That's I don't need anymore. I don't need

168
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:39,750
anymore. He's not reading chat. Why I can't how

169
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:44,710
am I gonna read chat and play this incredibly incredibly intense game?

170
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:53,289
I can actually climb this too. Oh it has the cat curtains. I get it.

171
00:19:53,289 --> 00:20:00,039
That's cute. How do I get these?

172
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:17,940
No no don't do it again. I'm all right. Funner.

173
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:32,019
Funnest. What is this? I don't care. What is that even for?

174
00:20:32,019 --> 00:20:51,539
Oh shit. Hold on. Get rid of those. All right so can I can I climb that wall?

175
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:55,059
Does it have to be a specific cat wall?

176
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:23,099
Oh he falls off. So what uh Mario was this one from?

177
00:21:23,099 --> 00:21:40,059
Climb it. No not climb. Climb that. This is fun. Cat's really hot right now.

178
00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:43,339
That's because I played Super Mario Galaxy 1

179
00:21:43,339 --> 00:21:50,539
10 years ago and I just admitted that on the internet.

180
00:21:50,539 --> 00:21:53,740
So I may as well have like strangled three people.

181
00:21:53,740 --> 00:22:08,390
All right got the foundation. Two foundations. I haven't owned one since

182
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:17,109
the Game Boy days. Relax. There's like some.

183
00:22:17,109 --> 00:22:23,769
Oh nice gazebo. Castle's gonna be rock solid.

184
00:22:23,769 --> 00:22:27,259
Okay let's get this castle rebuilt. Where do you want to start?

185
00:22:27,259 --> 00:22:34,869
Oh I don't know. West hall. Main hall. East hall.

186
00:22:34,869 --> 00:22:44,039
What do you guys think? West. I mean what I what I what I was about to

187
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:48,950
say. Who cares? I would be so desperately

188
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:52,519
reaching for a reason at this point. Well I used to live on the East

189
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:56,279
Coast but now I live on the West Coast. Who cares?

190
00:22:56,279 --> 00:23:09,589
What does that have to do with anything? But wait a minute. What about the one in

191
00:23:09,589 --> 00:23:17,019
the middle? I need more coins. Why do you hate these games? What? I

192
00:23:17,019 --> 00:23:21,539
don't hate these games. What? Where are you getting this? I'm gonna do

193
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:25,670
another job. I'm not. I can't make a decision.

194
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:28,789
Talk to the chief whenever you complete part of the castle.

195
00:23:28,789 --> 00:23:34,019
Should we have something new for you to build? No the question. Why do you

196
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:36,660
guys hate this game? When I told you I was playing Mario Maker 2 it was

197
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:41,859
like oh oh oh really?

198
00:23:41,859 --> 00:23:51,960
Let's do this one. There's one guy. No it was at least three.

199
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,079
How many are there? Like 3,000 people there? At least three of you. Sorry that's

200
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:59,240
like that's 10 percent. Well that's like 0.1 that's 0.01

201
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:06,380
percent. So that's like pretty I mean that I mean that's as much

202
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:11,369
that was you. No. Hold on. Today in the desert expect clear skies all day

203
00:24:11,369 --> 00:24:14,490
with a chance of solar flares. There's an excessive heat warning in

204
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:17,609
effect from sunrise to sunset. So don't forget to slather on a thick

205
00:24:17,609 --> 00:24:19,849
layer of sunscreen before stepping outdoors.

206
00:24:19,849 --> 00:24:24,259
Either that or find a propeller and press R to avoid the burn.

207
00:24:24,259 --> 00:24:33,660
Cool. The angry sun level is tricky. Time to be a god gamer.

208
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:37,740
All right which one is R? I haven't played this switch in like a year.

209
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:50,140
That's not it. That's not it. It actually flies down at you too. I'll

210
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:59,369
get it. I remember this from Mario 3. What's this thing? I've got like a

211
00:24:59,369 --> 00:25:02,970
bozo hat on? Oh right and now I've seen this

212
00:25:03,049 --> 00:25:14,009
before. I know what this one's like. How's this tricky? Oh wait it is

213
00:25:14,009 --> 00:25:17,579
gonna get tricky here. Come on come on. This is part of the

214
00:25:17,579 --> 00:25:23,109
secret up here or something. There's like a super coin up there.

215
00:25:23,109 --> 00:25:33,579
It's not even tricky. Shit. No no I need that.

216
00:25:33,579 --> 00:25:44,390
There's 10 in there. It's a distraction. Oh god.

217
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:52,759
Thank god I got the fucking oh shit. No and I okay I bumped my desk and it

218
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:58,380
did that. Oh my god it bumped the desk. My fat

219
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:03,099
like stomach leaned forward and hit L. That was not hard. Why are

220
00:26:03,099 --> 00:26:16,940
you freaking me out? All right now I got enough. I'm

221
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:24,789
gonna do the middle. Let's do the expensive one first.

222
00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:32,220
Miss 10 coins. It's okay. I'm all right with missing a few coins.

223
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:38,170
Let's do the middle. You sure about this? I'm sure.

224
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:46,009
Don't even build the left and right side. Just have a big cylinder in the

225
00:26:46,009 --> 00:26:54,730
middle. Main hall first floor. Red Toad is heading up the project.

226
00:26:54,730 --> 00:27:02,740
We've got the construction covered. Just get out there and complete more jobs.

227
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:13,849
I kind of love this. Is that weird? You can flip pages in the jobs list

228
00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:17,769
with L and R and you can look for a list of incomplete jobs by pressing

229
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:24,059
Y. Back to work. New jobs are in. All right hold on.

230
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:28,619
The mystery of the haunted manor. Swinging claw ropes course.

231
00:27:28,619 --> 00:27:35,160
The key master. This game is perfect for my

232
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:40,440
ADHD brain because I don't have to play any of the other Mario games.

233
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:45,369
They're all here. This is a shitload of levels that are every single Mario

234
00:27:45,369 --> 00:27:47,849
game. Why would I need to play any of the other ones?

235
00:27:47,849 --> 00:27:58,500
Let's try this one. So I made a ghost house recently but I think I got a

236
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:02,180
bit over my head because I'm kind of sort of trapped in here.

237
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,420
Should be able to get up with something strange about this place.

238
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:08,950
Can someone come and help me? All right here we go. This one's a

239
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:18,869
two-star. It's too hard.

240
00:28:19,589 --> 00:28:28,069
It might be. See this is great. Now hold on a minute here. It's a

241
00:28:28,069 --> 00:28:30,869
ghost level so I'm going to be deceived.

242
00:28:30,869 --> 00:28:39,769
Isn't there a kid you do like the spin jump thing with big Mario?

243
00:28:39,769 --> 00:28:48,140
They're like what? Yeah there it is. No I shouldn't be doing this

244
00:28:48,140 --> 00:29:00,730
because those are going to turn to coins. Can you pick up the turnips?

245
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:06,180
Yeah you can. All right hold up. What does this mean?

246
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:14,380
You can't. What? Oh it's the first time I'm with Yoshi.

247
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:39,049
Oh stop it. Go up. You can just jump off Yoshi right?

248
00:29:39,049 --> 00:29:47,799
Just eat them all. I can't eat that. He's dead.

249
00:29:47,799 --> 00:30:02,819
Oops. Quick get over there quick. I can't jump on his head?

250
00:30:02,819 --> 00:30:23,210
Why not? It's a ghost. Wait just take the other one.

251
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:27,289
That's different for some reason. Oh so I'm not crazy.

252
00:30:27,289 --> 00:30:34,099
Good to know. All right let's eat. I already know how this works.

253
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:39,799
Don't worry everybody. I know how to do this.

254
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:56,579
See give me a break. I can do the two-star level.

255
00:30:56,579 --> 00:31:05,529
But this is different. Okay oh I don't want to do this one.

256
00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:12,039
Um hold on let's go in the door. What the fuck was that?

257
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:19,980
That actually scared the shit out of me. All right why is this

258
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:41,960
P.T. Mario? Oh god. Oh god. Oh fuck. Now what? Oh I have to reset it.

259
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:55,589
Lisa get me up here. Wait hold on. Um I want to get

260
00:31:55,589 --> 00:32:00,410
there's another P. But should I? Is this going to take me out to the?

261
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:11,289
Hold on. Let's go. All right I've unlocked everything. What was this?

262
00:32:11,289 --> 00:32:15,690
What's the P? Oh wait. Oh oh.

263
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:27,289
Okay. No stay on Yoshi. Oh oh oh oh oh.

264
00:32:27,289 --> 00:32:34,069
What does this one do? I want to go in the P door.

265
00:32:34,069 --> 00:32:59,220
I want those 30 coins. Check this out. You're going too slow.

266
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:18,440
Do I get out of here? Can I not be on Yoshi? Oh I think that's it right?

267
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:26,740
Yeah. I'm not soft locked. I'm fine. Now that I did that.

268
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:35,700
Now we. But wait. What's. Am I gonna get a P?

269
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:39,220
Now I could have brought a P with me probably. But what about this door?

270
00:33:39,220 --> 00:34:11,829
Why have. I don't understand why I have that door. That hurt my ears. I'm sorry.

271
00:34:11,829 --> 00:34:15,909
I'm sorry. Yeah that was really fucking loud.

272
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:19,670
I just. I'm sorry about that. But I mean that was a times 10.

273
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:31,900
Sometimes you have to scream. How we doing? Need more? More coins?

274
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:36,619
I did peek the mic. There's people that have been asking about that for

275
00:34:36,619 --> 00:34:47,349
like six months. You got it. All right. This one's easy.

276
00:34:47,349 --> 00:34:53,369
We rebuild the castle. What if. What if this is the whole stream?

277
00:34:53,369 --> 00:35:06,460
Right? This is hard. I buried some coins in an underground room.

278
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:11,480
What do I care? Coins mean nothing to me anymore. What do we think about it?

279
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,960
All right. Reach the goal after grabbing all 30 coins.

280
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:24,570
I have to get all 30 coins. Reach the goal after grabbing all. I don't

281
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:30,840
have a hat anymore? Reach the goal after grabbing all 30.

282
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,360
Well I can tell you right now. Look at my brain just working.

283
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:38,340
Look at how good this brain is. There's gonna be one up here that they don't

284
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:44,699
tell you about. All right. These are all things I

285
00:35:44,699 --> 00:35:47,500
didn't even know you could do in Mario.

286
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:56,380
What's this weird top thing? His brain.

287
00:35:56,699 --> 00:36:06,059
Oh! This is just like the old game. Remember that old game?

288
00:36:06,059 --> 00:36:24,519
I can't believe I just got fucking reverse Pac-Man. God damn it.

289
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:27,400
All right. Now I know what's going on. Now I know that the hat. Wait. There's

290
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,599
only one. I'm not taking it. I'm gonna need it

291
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:44,150
eventually. For the lobsters? Used to do this to the lobsters. Yep.

292
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:51,900
And they never brought that enemy back. They never brought back the weird

293
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:56,260
crab lobster things. Oh god damn it. I didn't want to do

294
00:36:56,260 --> 00:37:10,340
that. Don't do it again! I've stopped

295
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:17,849
screaming. Fuck. I gotta put like a limiter on my

296
00:37:17,849 --> 00:37:21,210
voice. No. Let's not kill every enemy.

297
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:31,320
Just collect all coins. Oh that's why I need the uh

298
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:36,360
that's why I need the star. Uh oh. Tricky.

299
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:42,760
Where they going? Tricky. Why would I go in this one?

300
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:54,570
Just an illusion. Well who cares? I got you coins.

301
00:37:54,570 --> 00:38:11,900
Kick him over here. No. He's gonna. Oh.

302
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:19,960
Where's it going? Oh! I can't do it. I'm so. Holy shit. I almost died.

303
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:34,440
Just give me the coin and get me out. 30. I win, right?

304
00:38:34,440 --> 00:39:02,150
Secrets. Got it. No. I'm not doing left and right. We're going straight up.

305
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:06,500
I'm doing main hall four and then main hall

306
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:15,980
two f. So you can do any amount of them, right? You can do a million of

307
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:19,980
them if you want. All right. Swimming claw ropes.

308
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:24,099
Oops. I should have read that. No. But everyone. That's all right.

309
00:39:24,099 --> 00:39:28,260
That was unsatisfying what I just did. It was very satisfying.

310
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:38,550
And this is original Cake Mario. There it is.

311
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:42,070
There's Cake Mario. I knew I was gonna see it eventually.

312
00:39:42,070 --> 00:40:05,429
Didn't get it. Whoa! Sorry. How did I get past?

313
00:40:05,429 --> 00:40:12,619
No. No. No. I want those coins. I need the coins to build the castle.

314
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:23,820
I get itched my face. Wait. I think I needed those uh turtles.

315
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:30,889
Can I respawn them? Yeah. I need the turtles for that one.

316
00:40:30,889 --> 00:40:35,659
Like you can't wall jump in this one. Do with no balls.

317
00:40:35,659 --> 00:40:50,570
Why would I just die? Send me back. Send me put. Send me back. Send me back.

318
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:56,659
Send me back. I can get it.

319
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:23,849
Yes. I can feel every single one of those.

320
00:41:23,849 --> 00:41:35,579
I'm not gonna spend any of it. I'm gonna wait till I get to 10 grand.

321
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:46,409
I'm gonna put it on one hand of blackjack. Wait. What did she say?

322
00:41:46,409 --> 00:41:52,460
We got work to do. Yeah. I know. You want jobs? I got jobs.

323
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:57,260
Shoestopper. These shoe goompas are too much but the kicks they are rocking are

324
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:01,099
useful because you can walk over spike traps.

325
00:42:01,099 --> 00:42:03,820
The shoes probably don't smell great but you can always press R to take them

326
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:07,739
off and if you find a big shoe you can always slam down by tilting

327
00:42:07,739 --> 00:42:25,030
down in the air. Oh that's a cool snow level.

328
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:53,849
Oh it's a song from Undertale. Bean Bag Mario.

329
00:42:53,849 --> 00:43:01,380
I tried. I thought I could get it. I got greedy.

330
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:04,340
What I just did right there is the equivalent of staying in and swinging one

331
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:07,059
more time in Dark Souls and knowing it's a bad idea but you

332
00:43:07,059 --> 00:43:13,139
still gonna try it no matter what. See? Like I did it again.

333
00:43:13,139 --> 00:43:33,750
I need another shoe. Thank you. Bean Bag

334
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:36,550
Mario and Bean Bag Sonic should be friends. That's what somebody said I

335
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:46,179
think or something like that. I'm paraphrasing.

336
00:43:46,179 --> 00:43:49,619
Whoa. Why does it crashed into that guy?

337
00:43:49,619 --> 00:43:55,380
There's a big shoe. Give me the big shoe. I can't get in the big one?

338
00:43:55,380 --> 00:44:00,840
Yes I can. I can't get in the giant shoe tank. Of

339
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:14,699
course I can. What happened there? Well that was one

340
00:44:14,699 --> 00:44:16,940
pixel that I didn't get on that. Wait hold on.

341
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:25,940
Can I? I'm too big. I need a little shoe. Any more little shoes?

342
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:31,159
Is this a giant high heel? All right hold on. Wait.

343
00:44:31,159 --> 00:44:44,329
I need to get the giant heel. How do I get that?

344
00:44:44,329 --> 00:44:54,710
Oh shit. Oh shit. I need to get in there.

345
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:58,199
How does one get in there?

346
00:45:08,389 --> 00:45:12,699
I don't know why I'm so paranoid to jump on these guys. I can I can jump on

347
00:45:12,699 --> 00:45:18,230
those guys right? It was the flame that hit me.

348
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:22,550
Yeah all right. All right I gotta do this.

349
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:24,949
Ready?

350
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:33,940
I feel like I'm playing Joust right now and I don't like it. It's making

351
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:45,510
me feel panicky. Shit I needed that. No not

352
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:58,090
anymore. I should have jumped out. What am I doing?

353
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:17,699
Go back. You can't get them all. All right first hall.

354
00:46:17,699 --> 00:46:28,170
First main hall first floor is done. How much is the second one?

355
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:38,730
Cool. Wait you got a new building right?

356
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:43,530
Looking good. Go chief. Oh right you can press R to see the whole castle.

357
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:50,440
We have new building options now. Yep.

358
00:46:50,440 --> 00:47:02,869
1200. I'm almost out of jobs. What happens when all the jobs

359
00:47:02,869 --> 00:47:08,809
go away? So I made a ghost house. I'll pay anyone who can make it to the end.

360
00:47:08,809 --> 00:47:13,289
Here's a little hint. You'll need four keys. More if you want to get the true

361
00:47:13,289 --> 00:47:17,989
ending. Wink.

362
00:47:17,989 --> 00:47:24,889
So I need more keys to get the true ending. I gotta try to get the true

363
00:47:24,889 --> 00:47:35,300
ending. A little horn. All right well this

364
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:42,710
one key. I can't get it right now. So we've

365
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:51,159
got options here. We've got our spring which. Do I have to bring

366
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:57,380
it somewhere? I mean I don't know. There's nothing in

367
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:01,219
here. It's probably hit. I just fucked myself

368
00:48:01,219 --> 00:48:05,769
completely. Can I like even get out of here without him killing me?

369
00:48:05,769 --> 00:48:10,519
No. Look that pixel was bullshit. Did you see that?

370
00:48:10,519 --> 00:48:21,929
What happened there? Oh really? I have to.

371
00:48:21,929 --> 00:48:31,099
I need to get bigger. Hold on. Can I make it all the way back and grab the

372
00:48:31,099 --> 00:48:46,409
thing? Yes there it is. Found it.

373
00:48:46,409 --> 00:49:00,820
Ding dong. Three keys. Now what's in the other one? I need a

374
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:04,500
POW. I'm gonna take a guess and say the POW is gonna go in this one.

375
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:13,099
This one. This one right here. I don't know.

376
00:49:13,099 --> 00:49:24,969
Well I kicked it. How do I get a secret key in here?

377
00:49:24,969 --> 00:49:37,380
Spring? Well give me the POW. That's gonna get me killed. Just get in

378
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:40,900
there. Get in there. Oh they have melted

379
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:58,519
ghost snow. All right I didn't even need this.

380
00:49:58,519 --> 00:50:04,519
I don't know why but I thought there was fall damage for a second. So there's

381
00:50:04,519 --> 00:50:12,059
the one on the other side. A couple more. This one I don't

382
00:50:12,059 --> 00:50:21,320
know. I think that's it. I think it did it.

383
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:30,280
Oh no it didn't. But that's the right place.

384
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:36,070
Get a mushroom? No I live dangerously. I'm gonna do it without a mushroom.

385
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:52,730
That's too much time. Oh fuck I should have listened.

386
00:50:52,730 --> 00:51:00,469
All right I'm gonna get a mushroom. This is gonna freaking me out.

387
00:51:00,469 --> 00:51:05,559
You're right. I need to get a mushroom. You're correct. I know. I'm gonna I'm

388
00:51:05,559 --> 00:51:15,269
gonna listen. Just give one to me. So there's the

389
00:51:15,269 --> 00:51:18,070
fourth key right there which is the P but I'm not doing that because I

390
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:21,960
wanted to get the true ending. So we need to bring the spring

391
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:30,699
somewhere. Where I did it? Over here? What is it like in here?

392
00:51:30,699 --> 00:51:39,210
Yeah there we go. I need to get you. This is like a

393
00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:42,889
you fly up. So how do I move you over there?

394
00:51:42,889 --> 00:52:02,659
How do I get you to move? Is it an enemy? No it's not an enemy. Okay.

395
00:52:02,659 --> 00:52:18,619
Wait will he actually? No give this to me.

396
00:52:18,619 --> 00:52:21,739
No I want it to be no. Give it put it down here.

397
00:52:21,739 --> 00:52:31,110
There we go. All right I got the five keys. No I don't. Not yet.

398
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:54,409
What? Get up there. Why is it? What? Am I insane? All right I got them all.

399
00:52:54,409 --> 00:53:06,840
The fifth key is there and I get the secret ending.

400
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:13,269
Five. Out the door. Two. Three. Four. Five.

401
00:53:13,269 --> 00:53:34,619
Two. Three. Four. Five. What do I do with the fifth one?

402
00:53:34,619 --> 00:53:54,619
What? I need more keys? They said five.

403
00:53:54,619 --> 00:54:00,039
No nobody said five. They said find more.

404
00:54:00,039 --> 00:54:06,199
Four or more not five. There's so many that's a lot of

405
00:54:06,199 --> 00:54:12,389
coins though. All right so what have I not used?

406
00:54:12,389 --> 00:54:18,099
Do I need three more keys? I guess I didn't go

407
00:54:18,099 --> 00:54:28,389
I didn't go on this. Let me look in here. Well this is obviously I need another I

408
00:54:28,389 --> 00:54:32,489
need the spring here. And then we jump. I get it. Check this

409
00:54:32,489 --> 00:54:40,099
out. Spring over on the left. Yeah I'm gonna jump from spring to

410
00:54:40,099 --> 00:55:10,230
spring and I should get it. No I need this one over here. Everybody

411
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:26,280
thought I was stupid. Really? The intent was there. All

412
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:37,059
right now this is what about this one? I don't know it's the other one.

413
00:55:37,619 --> 00:55:41,739
So how do I do this? The spring? The pow? No.

414
00:55:41,739 --> 00:55:48,059
It's probably the spring. I have to like get on top of that.

415
00:55:48,059 --> 00:55:51,849
Obviously I have to get on top of this. Oh shit.

416
00:55:51,849 --> 00:55:57,909
Okay now I'm gonna hit a there's a secret block somewhere here and it's

417
00:55:57,909 --> 00:56:02,309
probably gonna be like right here. Oh fuck. How about over here? Here?

418
00:56:02,309 --> 00:56:15,500
Here? I'm gonna jump from the spring up. Oh god this is gonna kill me.

419
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:18,619
Hold on. I need a mushroom. I need to get a mushroom first. I'll

420
00:56:18,619 --> 00:56:21,900
screw this up. What's that sound? What? Oh I have a

421
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:27,929
hundred seconds. I need one more. Where's the last one? Hold on give me

422
00:56:27,929 --> 00:56:46,969
a mushroom. This one more. Where is it? It's the P. P right?

423
00:56:46,969 --> 00:56:52,869
Hurry hurry go go go go. Did I get this one?

424
00:56:52,869 --> 00:57:05,349
I already got this one. Wait what about what about if I'm

425
00:57:05,349 --> 00:57:07,909
getting it's like uh Far Cry 4. You just have to go in the

426
00:57:07,909 --> 00:57:40,599
beginning. Up there? No it's too late. It's too late. I don't have time.

427
00:57:40,599 --> 00:57:44,650
Oh I have to come back and do this again? I got 40. No no I gotta go. Get

428
00:57:45,210 --> 00:57:55,369
out of the way. That's a lot of coins but I don't I can't

429
00:57:55,369 --> 00:58:03,940
I'm not I can't do it. Anything else in here? Just check in here.

430
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:28,340
Nothing else? Two, three, fuck. No just restarted? No I'm not going to

431
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:32,699
restart. I'm just gonna do it. I'm just gonna finish it. Use the

432
00:58:32,699 --> 00:59:02,659
uh I feel so unfulfilled though. See I would have gone at zero but

433
00:59:02,659 --> 00:59:06,739
I don't know in Mario specifically this one. Does it

434
00:59:06,739 --> 00:59:18,619
kill you at zero or zero one die? I wasn't gonna take that risk.

435
00:59:18,619 --> 00:59:27,670
Redo it. All right let's I'm gonna redo it.

436
00:59:27,670 --> 00:59:36,969
So where's the where's the first one? I know how to get them all.

437
00:59:36,969 --> 00:59:42,500
So I'll just get them all quick. This won't take very long.

438
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:49,880
I'm gonna start with POW. We're gonna go to the right up this one.

439
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:54,920
I have plenty of time. 500 seconds is like 12 minutes.

440
00:59:54,920 --> 01:00:01,239
I got plenty of time.

441
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:12,460
Seven minutes. Yeah but whatever. It's enough time.

442
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:15,579
Give me the spring. I got springs over here.

443
01:00:15,579 --> 01:00:20,219
Straight up this one. And I'm not gonna turn it in till I have I mean I

444
01:00:20,219 --> 01:00:23,420
when I used to play Diablo 3 and I mean that game's not like that

445
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:26,219
great but when I used to do the bounties I

446
01:00:26,219 --> 01:00:28,619
would collect the bounties and have like 10 of them and open them all

447
01:00:28,619 --> 01:00:31,179
at the same time. I want to have all eight keys.

448
01:00:31,179 --> 01:00:49,590
Oh my god he almost got me. Sometimes it would be 20.

449
01:00:49,590 --> 01:01:06,980
I don't have time for this shit. Come on. Even Mario was looking at that going

450
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:15,130
like all right. All right that's all of them over here.

451
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:26,119
Get the P coins. You can be Luigi.

452
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:47,989
Wait is that a joke? I thought you were joking. I'm sorry.

453
01:01:47,989 --> 01:02:08,469
I need this. Watch this. Ready? Wasn't that cool?

454
01:02:08,469 --> 01:02:20,219
Could have been. Can I hit it like this? No.

455
01:02:20,219 --> 01:02:23,500
There we go. But I still have to grab it. No I don't. It's free.

456
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:30,900
One two. I'm trying to count the keys. One two three. I only have five.

457
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:44,099
How did I get the other ones? Well there's one there. Right okay.

458
01:02:44,099 --> 01:02:52,500
So that would be six. Oh yeah the conveyor room. Right.

459
01:02:52,500 --> 01:03:08,260
Does this kill him? It does. Should have used it before.

460
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:11,460
All right look at all those bounty caches I got. Look at all those bounty

461
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:20,309
boxes. One two three four five six seven. One more. So let's see. I'm gonna say

462
01:03:20,309 --> 01:03:32,070
no. There's one more. There's one there. I need I need to go find one more. Let's see

463
01:03:32,070 --> 01:03:46,230
it up here. And there it is. What the hell do I do with this?

464
01:03:46,230 --> 01:04:20,889
What's wrong with them? Is it a battery? Did I just give him like a

465
01:04:20,889 --> 01:04:39,940
battery? Let's go. Oh my god. I'm gonna go up.

466
01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:49,340
Got them all. All right. I just ripped his brain out. Have a nice life.

467
01:04:49,340 --> 01:05:08,780
I did it. Now I get all those coins. And I got time to spare.

468
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:29,159
The good ending. The expensive ending. And yeah here's the anxiety music.

469
01:05:29,159 --> 01:05:37,000
And why is it still on? Will the jack in the box come out already? I'm

470
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:57,820
waiting for him to pop out. And that was a nice little song. I have

471
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:03,639
to get these all.

472
01:06:09,219 --> 01:06:18,969
Would that be there? Well uh why would that be there?

473
01:06:23,829 --> 01:06:32,230
Oh god. Oh well. Oh all right. It's all right.

474
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:38,539
I can get them back. Those last three coins are just

475
01:06:38,539 --> 01:06:51,000
trapped. You can't get them. Where did it go? What did I just throw it to?

476
01:06:51,000 --> 01:07:05,400
What? I threw it. That's so dumb. At least you got the coins. Yeah and

477
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:08,519
then they all. This game's Sonic the Hedgehog's you.

478
01:07:08,519 --> 01:07:27,510
You lose them all. Yeah it was for three coins.

479
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:43,719
Come here. I want it in here. Stop picking it up.

480
01:07:43,800 --> 01:08:06,309
The POW. I really didn't think I was gonna be on this for this long.

481
01:08:06,309 --> 01:08:09,909
Slow it down. I don't want to mess it up again. So and I didn't even mess it

482
01:08:09,909 --> 01:08:20,390
up. I got trolled last time. So that doesn't count. Third first try.

483
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:35,579
Let's make this happen. Let's get the coins first.

484
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:52,310
Got it. All right then we just have to do the

485
01:08:52,310 --> 01:08:57,510
throw. I'm just gonna take the POW. Let's do this one.

486
01:08:57,510 --> 01:09:06,199
It's right here.

487
01:09:09,850 --> 01:09:20,550
Get it. Now all we need is the pancake. All right that's it. Riders need the

488
01:09:20,550 --> 01:09:36,170
this one here. He sounds annoyed. I'm not annoyed. Am I tall enough to

489
01:09:36,170 --> 01:09:48,710
get this? It's one coin.

490
01:09:48,789 --> 01:09:54,840
One two three four five six seven eight. The last one is up there.

491
01:09:54,840 --> 01:10:02,359
This time I'm gonna bring the spring. I'm gonna go get a spring. Can I go get a

492
01:10:02,359 --> 01:10:20,869
spring and put it here? Here we go. Come on down. You can keep

493
01:10:20,869 --> 01:10:27,369
your brain this time. All right now I'm gonna bring the

494
01:10:27,369 --> 01:10:38,789
spring up here. So let's hold on. Can I...

495
01:10:38,789 --> 01:10:42,229
No I have to do this first. I gotta get the key. Come back.

496
01:10:42,229 --> 01:10:46,229
Get the coins. All right. I can just step on it now.

497
01:10:46,229 --> 01:11:01,029
All right. I'm ready. That's eight right? One two three four five six seven eight.

498
01:11:01,029 --> 01:11:29,640
Hooray. All right up. Same deal. This time don't fall through the hole.

499
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:43,350
And I get to build this next part of the castle. It's worth doing.

500
01:11:43,350 --> 01:12:06,359
Hey you get to hear the song again. Oh shit. Is there anything up there?

501
01:12:06,359 --> 01:12:10,939
Oh I did it. It's still times 10. Times 10 is not even a big deal. Why did I

502
01:12:10,939 --> 01:12:32,659
scream? Castle level two. Let's do it.

503
01:12:32,739 --> 01:12:53,180
Bingo. You sure about this? I am sure. Nice. More jobs. More jobs. Six new jobs.

504
01:12:53,180 --> 01:13:01,750
That's one hot car. Yo this fire junior clown car course that I made is off

505
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:04,710
the hook. Hold Y to charge up your cannon and

506
01:13:04,710 --> 01:13:09,109
then let it go to fire a charge shot that can cook fools and bust hard

507
01:13:09,109 --> 01:13:13,800
blocks. Press R to get out of the car. You

508
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:16,359
need to go down that. You need to go down a pipe at some

509
01:13:16,359 --> 01:13:23,300
point. What? Is there an actual clown car level in

510
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:32,060
this game? Hold Y to charge. Oh it's not really a

511
01:13:32,060 --> 01:13:45,109
real clown car. That felt good. Good coins.

512
01:13:45,109 --> 01:14:05,819
Hey hey hey. Let's grab them. I can't get hurt down here.

513
01:14:05,819 --> 01:14:08,060
I almost got hit by that bullet. I don't know why. I thought it was an

514
01:14:08,060 --> 01:14:24,729
indicator. It's R to get out right? Touch it so

515
01:14:24,729 --> 01:14:27,130
don't spritz it. All right I gotta get a pipe at some point right? But

516
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:30,010
wait not yet. There's probably something over here.

517
01:14:30,090 --> 01:14:50,090
Too bad. I can. Oh that's cool. People are going to make some cool

518
01:14:50,090 --> 01:15:00,920
shit with this. Definitely. Upgraded triple shot.

519
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:04,439
I cannot get rid of the cannons but yes I can.

520
01:15:04,439 --> 01:15:13,140
Drop them in. I think it has made this harder for myself.

521
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:25,460
Kind of. Get it there. Go go go go. Get up.

522
01:15:25,460 --> 01:15:37,380
You can make a bullet hell. Yeah. Shit. I tried to duck.

523
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:42,869
That's not going to work. Just get up. Oh my gosh. Standing in front of it.

524
01:15:42,869 --> 01:16:31,500
All right into the cup. Touch the axe. Touch the axe. I did it.

525
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:39,350
Continue the build. You just just killed an entire castle so you could

526
01:16:39,350 --> 01:16:49,989
build your own. My castle's not evil.

527
01:16:49,989 --> 01:17:03,510
Swinging claws. Oh cool. Imperialism. No I'm this I'm taking out the evil

528
01:17:03,510 --> 01:17:10,390
people. Oh I love when they do this style.

529
01:17:10,390 --> 01:17:24,520
Makes me feel like I'm just working on a game boy.

530
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:27,960
Get over here goomba. I need to jump on you to get up there.

531
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:41,289
Oh god damn it. Come on. No pick him up. Pick up the goomba.

532
01:17:41,289 --> 01:17:46,859
All right then I have to get close when he gets close enough. Don't do

533
01:17:46,859 --> 01:17:51,180
that yet. No no. I want to drop him on that.

534
01:17:51,180 --> 01:18:01,640
Because bullet that head would do something. Nice. There it is.

535
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:05,739
More claw games. All right then drop them here.

536
01:18:05,739 --> 01:18:13,960
Oh shit. Hold on. All right then drop them here on this prize machine.

537
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:34,119
This is cool. This is innovative. Oh they you have

538
01:18:34,119 --> 01:18:38,649
I get it. Pick him up and then you have to put him down here.

539
01:18:38,649 --> 01:18:46,420
So oh god. All right hold on. Pick him up

540
01:18:46,420 --> 01:18:54,250
and then place him over there. No get him.

541
01:18:54,250 --> 01:18:58,260
Get somebody get him. He's he'll get him on the way back right there.

542
01:18:58,260 --> 01:19:02,489
Right now. Got it. All right and then let it go.

543
01:19:02,489 --> 01:19:15,289
You gonna pick me up? Oh wait wait wait wait. What's going on here?

544
01:19:15,289 --> 01:19:21,500
And then you gotta drop him on there. Pick him up and then bring him this

545
01:19:21,579 --> 01:19:36,199
way. Oh shit he died.

546
01:19:42,729 --> 01:19:50,380
All right put him in that. Ding dong. Now you

547
01:19:50,380 --> 01:19:53,880
I didn't think they were gonna come down here. Oh shit. I need to get in

548
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:58,069
that. All right now don't die here. Are

549
01:19:58,069 --> 01:20:13,479
those. Does this flappy bird shit kill you? No.

550
01:20:13,479 --> 01:20:26,170
That was cute. That was a cute one. Two more levels and I can get. It's

551
01:20:26,170 --> 01:20:35,500
probably gonna be way too much money. Tree top fireballs. I managed to plant

552
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:37,819
some trees and they actually look pretty good.

553
01:20:37,819 --> 01:20:51,130
Can you try climbing all 12 of my trees? Yes I can.

554
01:20:51,130 --> 01:20:56,149
Do the harder ones? Well I want to just get them all done. I'm just doing it as

555
01:20:56,149 --> 01:21:03,939
they come. Climb on the trees. One. The snow comes off too. They've

556
01:21:03,939 --> 01:21:16,680
thought of everything. I don't know. I don't know what

557
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:26,970
that does but whatever. Is that gonna hurt me? No it's

558
01:21:26,970 --> 01:21:44,329
just there. One more trees.

559
01:21:47,380 --> 01:22:01,460
Only one to kill that guy. It's usually like six.

560
01:22:01,460 --> 01:22:20,779
Oh all right. They give me a nice little break.

561
01:22:20,779 --> 01:22:28,090
Burning the locals to death. I mean are these.

562
01:22:28,090 --> 01:22:32,010
They're they're killing us. They're trying to kill me.

563
01:22:32,010 --> 01:22:51,130
No they're not. They're kind of not at all.

564
01:22:51,130 --> 01:23:18,659
How's this not 12? Did I miss one? Oh it's right here okay. What just. I

565
01:23:18,659 --> 01:23:22,739
was. You can climb the hole and all right. I got a pretty good score

566
01:23:22,739 --> 01:23:37,260
regardless. 174 dollars. All right one more and then I'm

567
01:23:37,260 --> 01:23:40,300
gonna find out if I don't have enough money.

568
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:46,949
We'll find out real quick. Plenty of cheap cheeps in the sea. This swimming

569
01:23:46,949 --> 01:23:52,439
level is gonna be horrible. There's way too many cheap cheeps.

570
01:23:52,439 --> 01:23:58,149
Is it even possible to beat this? Someone help me.

571
01:23:58,149 --> 01:24:01,029
Well sorry. Well Toad you have to be able to beat your own level before

572
01:24:01,029 --> 01:24:04,760
you put it up here. So you had to have already beaten

573
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:19,369
this. Nice lie. Oh it's a water level. Might as well skip it.

574
01:24:19,369 --> 01:24:22,739
I hate these water levels. I don't have the kind of control that I'm looking

575
01:24:22,739 --> 01:24:27,979
for. The exact precision that I want. It always causes me a huge problem.

576
01:24:27,979 --> 01:24:40,939
Although this is not that hard. Nobody likes water levels. No.

577
01:24:40,939 --> 01:24:51,340
Oh no. No. No. It's like timed. I thought that was a mushrooms output to

578
01:24:51,340 --> 01:25:06,069
grab one. Okay good. Wasn't that bad. Wasn't

579
01:25:06,069 --> 01:25:10,340
as bad as I made it out to seem like.

580
01:25:10,340 --> 01:25:15,100
Timed underwater escort mission. Yep. Oh there's the tweedle dees. Whatever

581
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:17,819
they're called. What are those actual caterpillar things

582
01:25:17,819 --> 01:25:53,130
called? Oh got it. Mario time. The wiggles.

583
01:25:53,130 --> 01:26:16,600
There it is. Now let's do middle hall three.

584
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:20,359
It's so beautiful. Keep up the good work. We're gonna try.

585
01:26:20,359 --> 01:26:23,399
Oh I have to do something else now. I got the money to do it. Let's do

586
01:26:23,399 --> 01:26:33,899
west hall. Can't just go straight up. Sorry. I

587
01:26:33,899 --> 01:26:36,140
also have enough money to do these tall as well.

588
01:26:36,220 --> 01:27:03,399
Doing both. We get more jobs. Six new jobs. Six new jobs. Six new jobs.

589
01:27:03,399 --> 01:27:07,800
Something about this is just actually very very satisfying to play.

590
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:11,319
All right so let's do let's do a hard one.

591
01:27:11,319 --> 01:27:14,439
This is a hard one. No jumping allowed.

592
01:27:14,439 --> 01:27:17,079
Here's a challenge. Try to get through the whole level without jumping

593
01:27:17,079 --> 01:27:20,600
off the ground and landing. Any takers anyone. There's a prize for

594
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:24,760
anyone who succeeds. Here's a hint. Use y to dash.

595
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:35,449
The game master. I can't jump. Reach the goal without landing after

596
01:27:35,449 --> 01:27:43,720
leaving the ground. So wait. What do you mean without

597
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:47,560
landing after leaving the ground? Does that count if I land up there?

598
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:57,159
If I land up top there does it count? I didn't even make it fucking ten

599
01:27:57,159 --> 01:28:11,590
steps. I was trying to. Whoa no! I gotta

600
01:28:11,590 --> 01:28:19,750
I gotta get my fucking brain. No I don't need to be Luigi. Don't

601
01:28:19,750 --> 01:28:26,729
worry. What the fuck? I thought he was gonna go

602
01:28:26,729 --> 01:28:31,479
down. Oh my god. I'm gonna lose all my characters.

603
01:28:31,479 --> 01:28:35,779
I thought he was gonna go down into the ground after passing once.

604
01:28:35,779 --> 01:28:54,979
Oh no. Here he comes. Wait. Does that count?

605
01:28:54,979 --> 01:28:57,939
That doesn't count right? Because I'm not touching the ground. That's

606
01:28:57,939 --> 01:29:00,180
that's a that's a donut. That's not a ground.

607
01:29:00,180 --> 01:29:31,210
Okay. Oh shit. All right. Give me a flag.

608
01:29:31,210 --> 01:29:38,010
Do they have a platform? I can't go. I don't want to go down.

609
01:29:38,010 --> 01:29:52,329
Fuck. Do I have to stand on that? Oh my god.

610
01:29:52,329 --> 01:30:00,039
What happens if I run out of lives? What happens if I run out? Does anyone know?

611
01:30:00,039 --> 01:30:22,090
You save gets deleted. False.

612
01:30:22,090 --> 01:30:29,670
You get reincarnated as an ant. Oh interesting.

613
01:30:29,670 --> 01:30:41,899
Come on down. What are they shooting? All right that just freaked me out. Now

614
01:30:41,899 --> 01:30:45,420
this is important. So let me watch him. I need to see

615
01:30:45,420 --> 01:30:49,510
where he goes. He runs over here and that I didn't even

616
01:30:49,510 --> 01:30:52,470
move. I didn't even I didn't even fucking move.

617
01:30:52,470 --> 01:31:03,159
Okay that it freaked me out. What happens if I

618
01:31:03,159 --> 01:31:14,630
I didn't even move. I have to complete this. No I can't.

619
01:31:14,630 --> 01:31:28,170
Tape the button down. Too bad. Do I lose the game? Do I did I just lose?

620
01:31:28,170 --> 01:31:40,819
He can do it for you. Do we get to watch him play it?

621
01:31:40,819 --> 01:31:49,529
I hope it's actually a cell phone call. Hope you actually call him.

622
01:32:05,220 --> 01:32:10,250
Hello. Hey can you help me beat this level?

623
01:32:10,250 --> 01:32:24,020
I'm in traffic right now. Stop fucking calling me. Oh shit.

624
01:32:24,020 --> 01:32:38,819
I didn't jump. Everybody gets a one. You call it 15 times.

625
01:32:38,819 --> 01:32:47,800
The game just launched. Maybe you should try

626
01:32:47,800 --> 01:33:12,119
What is that game? Candy Crush. Okay I'm I don't understand this. Here we go.

627
01:33:12,119 --> 01:33:15,880
I don't understand it. I don't understand it. I don't understand it.

628
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:21,590
Yeah I have to use the draw. I'm gonna let him do it.

629
01:33:21,590 --> 01:33:25,880
I'm gonna call Luigi. I'm gonna say like hurry home from work.

630
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:31,140
I need you to beat a level for me. I just stand still as I did the last

631
01:33:31,140 --> 01:33:51,960
time and I fell off his head and it discounted me.

632
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:54,760
All right I'm gonna do it this time. I'm not fucking this up. I'm just gonna stand

633
01:33:54,760 --> 01:34:13,189
still on his head. Come on booze let's go. What now what?

634
01:34:13,189 --> 01:34:51,180
Hurry they're coming. What do I do about this? What happened?

635
01:34:51,180 --> 01:34:55,930
You went into the air. I didn't go in the air. I didn't go in the

636
01:34:55,930 --> 01:35:13,819
Did I already lose? I gotta call Luigi.

637
01:35:13,819 --> 01:35:36,180
What was that? What happened? What happened?

638
01:35:36,180 --> 01:35:47,800
Let me try again. Hi this is Luigi. Mama mia call me back at a later date.

639
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:58,010
Take a message. What happened? I could just call him. What's going on?

640
01:35:58,010 --> 01:36:11,659
I can't. He has to do it. I can't. I have to press I have I can't do it.

641
01:36:11,659 --> 01:36:15,420
This task is too much for me to do. It really is. I just can't do it. I'm

642
01:36:15,420 --> 01:36:17,260
like I'm like looking over at chat and I'm

643
01:36:17,260 --> 01:36:20,619
like fucking falling off the ground. I can't do it. I can't. I can do it.

644
01:36:20,619 --> 01:36:32,140
I'll do it. Guys I can't. Luigi I can't call Luigi anymore.

645
01:36:32,140 --> 01:36:35,420
He called up Verizon and had my number fucking blocked

646
01:36:35,420 --> 01:37:07,420
permanently. Okay so what happened here?

647
01:37:07,420 --> 01:37:13,989
Just stand on it and just let it... I walked off.

648
01:37:13,989 --> 01:37:19,050
Give me a break. There's even more of this shit.

649
01:37:19,050 --> 01:38:02,810
Now what? Get up. What's over here? Should I let this pick me up? I

650
01:38:02,810 --> 01:38:12,630
wasn't fast enough. I need to watch this for a minute.

651
01:38:12,710 --> 01:38:37,930
Two. Two. How do I get that? Will the bomb blow it up?

652
01:38:37,930 --> 01:38:49,800
They can disappear. What's the purpose of that? That has to be a purpose of

653
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:53,859
what you're doing there. The donuts just walk across the

654
01:38:53,859 --> 01:38:59,689
donuts? Do I bounce on the donuts? I've never seen the donuts before.

655
01:38:59,689 --> 01:39:03,130
What the fuck was that? It's lots of slipperiness there.

656
01:39:03,130 --> 01:39:22,039
Does this count if I go through this? Am I gonna land on something?

657
01:39:22,039 --> 01:39:42,250
Oh shit um do I have to direct him here? I don't dude I don't care about the

658
01:39:42,250 --> 01:40:18,460
coins anymore. I almost just pressed jump.

659
01:40:18,460 --> 01:40:37,930
That was kind of hard. I have to do both at the same time. Mental breakdown? No.

660
01:40:37,930 --> 01:40:43,399
Not yet. What else we got for jobs? We got fire koopa clown carnage.

661
01:40:43,399 --> 01:40:57,579
Uh yep. Ask again in a few hours? Yeah. Ask again in a few hours. We'll

662
01:40:57,579 --> 01:41:02,090
see if I can be the first person on twitch to complete this.

663
01:41:02,090 --> 01:41:06,649
Um the game's been out for like 12 hours. I don't think that's gonna be

664
01:41:06,649 --> 01:41:17,510
the thing. I can jump again. What am I doing?

665
01:41:17,510 --> 01:41:38,789
That's so burnt in my brain that I can't jump. He's been conditioned.

666
01:41:38,789 --> 01:41:57,960
At this point yes. Spread out. Oops. Did I not kill these? What if I

667
01:41:57,960 --> 01:42:13,319
should jump on them? They don't have a chance? Yeah they

668
01:42:13,319 --> 01:42:22,600
shouldn't. Oh what does this do? Can I? Oh it's like an extra health bar

669
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:42,170
right? Yeah it's one extra hit. That thing comes off. Like that.

670
01:42:42,170 --> 01:42:47,140
Like that. Good thing I had a hard head.

671
01:42:47,140 --> 01:43:05,850
Boom. Get one up too. I'll take it.

672
01:43:07,289 --> 01:43:10,649
This is dumb luck that I haven't been hit yet.

673
01:43:10,649 --> 01:43:29,130
How fast does he go? Where the shit in the battle toads?

674
01:43:29,130 --> 01:43:50,739
All right hold on. Slow down. Slow down. Slow slow slow. Oh fuck.

675
01:43:50,739 --> 01:44:04,310
Watch out for that really slow moving arrow. Just get out and get it.

676
01:44:04,310 --> 01:44:24,539
Oh shit. Hold on. Is it still there? Go back. Go back. Go back.

677
01:44:24,539 --> 01:44:35,779
Need that spike helmet. Yeah that's true. That's sweet.

678
01:44:35,779 --> 01:44:40,500
Double. One more job and then we'll be at probably what?

679
01:44:40,500 --> 01:44:48,069
Somebody up there? Oh I can go in the castle. Oh this is cool.

680
01:44:48,069 --> 01:44:55,060
What's going on up here? This is this is a regular toad.

681
01:44:55,060 --> 01:45:00,859
I need your help. It'll be bad if the chief overhears.

682
01:45:00,859 --> 01:45:07,770
Mutiny? Heavy stone heave ho. We went off a budget and ran out of stone

683
01:45:07,770 --> 01:45:12,010
for making stairs. And of course the chief says we only

684
01:45:12,010 --> 01:45:15,369
use stone from the desert. I'll do it myself but it's so heavy.

685
01:45:15,369 --> 01:45:19,210
Could you bring me some? Reach the goal while holding a stone.

686
01:45:19,210 --> 01:45:32,779
Let's go. Oh Mario cake. It's my favorite kind. It's my favorite Mario.

687
01:45:32,779 --> 01:45:36,220
I gotta hold the stone the whole time. Whatever happens if I let it go.

688
01:45:36,220 --> 01:45:39,560
I have to hold down this button the whole time which I get really sweaty

689
01:45:39,560 --> 01:45:43,479
greasy hands. So this is gonna be hard to do.

690
01:45:43,479 --> 01:46:15,239
Go here. Oh fuck. I could have got it.

691
01:46:15,239 --> 01:46:42,220
I want that. How do I get that though? Okay well that was easier than I

692
01:46:42,220 --> 01:46:46,680
thought it was gonna be. You can put the stone down. How do

693
01:46:46,680 --> 01:46:54,020
you know that? I thought I'd wait I just had to

694
01:46:54,020 --> 01:46:57,539
it's a left for dead gnome run. Only 17 coins.

695
01:46:57,539 --> 01:47:03,880
You didn't try? I didn't want to lose any an extra life. I need those.

696
01:47:03,880 --> 01:47:12,279
Okay so what was the oh that's it. Let's go.

697
01:47:12,279 --> 01:47:27,989
25 percent? 30 percent? 26 more workers.

698
01:47:27,989 --> 01:47:32,359
Mario we need some blocks to get to the east hall from here but

699
01:47:32,359 --> 01:47:36,810
Mario can you keep a secret? Thanks and good luck.

700
01:47:37,640 --> 01:47:45,800
What was the secret? That's the secret. Purple toad who makes the blocks hasn't

701
01:47:45,800 --> 01:47:50,090
arrived yet. Got the schedule wrong management am I

702
01:47:50,090 --> 01:47:52,569
right? Anyway please bring the purple toad

703
01:47:52,569 --> 01:47:58,569
back here. Reach the goal with one toad in tow.

704
01:47:58,569 --> 01:48:08,489
What do you mean in what do you mean toad in tow?

705
01:48:08,489 --> 01:48:19,350
Where do I get this toad? I just realized something.

706
01:48:19,350 --> 01:48:22,470
All these mushrooms you know because before it was just there was just the

707
01:48:22,470 --> 01:48:26,149
one toad. Now there's a shitload of toads. This

708
01:48:26,149 --> 01:48:29,779
toad's everywhere. Take a look at what the mushrooms in this

709
01:48:29,779 --> 01:48:34,779
game look like. They look exactly like toad's head.

710
01:48:34,779 --> 01:48:43,020
Think about that and we've we've come to learn that there are

711
01:48:43,020 --> 01:48:46,380
hundreds if not like millions of toads.

712
01:48:46,380 --> 01:49:04,220
Where the mushrooms come from? Look at them.

713
01:49:04,220 --> 01:49:06,859
Look at this little his face and look at that toad face. Look at the

714
01:49:06,859 --> 01:49:12,869
look at the mushroom. Somebody get the with those

715
01:49:12,869 --> 01:49:16,310
theorists on the line.

716
01:49:16,470 --> 01:49:32,899
Jump on top of them. Risky move risky play. Oh shit.

717
01:49:32,899 --> 01:49:46,199
Risky move here. Shoot one more. Not gonna shoot another one.

718
01:49:46,199 --> 01:49:51,989
Right at the bottom. One coin. Why is Yoshi born with shoes on?

719
01:49:51,989 --> 01:50:08,550
Man that's kind of weird. I'm gonna have dreams about this shit.

720
01:50:08,550 --> 01:50:22,260
How many more do I have to do that like three or four more times?

721
01:50:22,260 --> 01:50:25,300
Well anything else you need me to do over here on the

722
01:50:25,300 --> 01:50:33,289
rampart? Okay you didn't hear me say that. Oh I'm ready to start working

723
01:50:33,289 --> 01:50:43,180
the rest of the east hall. Oh you have to. I see. Hello you.

724
01:50:43,180 --> 01:50:48,250
We're gonna find a new toad. The chief took my cloud because she said

725
01:50:48,250 --> 01:50:51,449
she needed it for something or other. I don't want the chief to hear this so

726
01:50:51,449 --> 01:50:57,079
let me just whisper it in your ear. The chief asked me to get a Lakitu's

727
01:50:57,079 --> 01:50:59,720
cloud for the west hall. Can you believe that?

728
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:03,000
Who asked someone to do something that they don't want to do themselves?

729
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:06,279
Oh hey can you go and get me a Lakitu's cloud Mario?

730
01:51:06,279 --> 01:51:15,609
Comedy. I can't wait for like the glass door reviews

731
01:51:15,609 --> 01:51:19,770
of rebuilding the magic kingdom. Whatever this is.

732
01:51:19,770 --> 01:51:28,890
Oh I got my time. How much time do I have? Not very much time at all.

733
01:51:30,489 --> 01:51:55,180
12 seconds. Four. There's a four up there.

734
01:51:55,180 --> 01:52:06,039
I had four seconds left. What? Get out of here.

735
01:52:06,039 --> 01:52:09,560
Blocked. What? I had four seconds left.

736
01:52:09,560 --> 01:52:16,069
Oh my god. The cloud has its own timer so what's the extra three seconds for

737
01:52:16,069 --> 01:52:29,659
on the clock? Why not just make it 12 seconds or 16 seconds?

738
01:52:35,239 --> 01:52:52,550
Okay I made it over. It was so sloppy. Oh god damn it.

739
01:52:52,550 --> 01:53:07,109
I kind of want to call Luigi. I want to know what it does.

740
01:53:07,109 --> 01:53:21,210
I'm not calling him yet. It's really slippery in the cloud.

741
01:53:26,229 --> 01:53:39,899
Oh my god I can't fucking do this. I was being so careful.

742
01:53:39,899 --> 01:53:46,199
Oh oh all right just it's not even that big of a deal. I'm just freaking

743
01:53:46,199 --> 01:53:50,460
out for no reason. Nobody can do anything with this music

744
01:53:50,460 --> 01:53:54,340
on. They should make relaxing music here.

745
01:53:54,340 --> 01:53:58,420
Like calm down music. Imagine if your boss was fucking

746
01:53:58,420 --> 01:54:02,569
yelling at you to finish doing something.

747
01:54:02,569 --> 01:54:11,529
You screwed that whole thing up Jacob.

748
01:54:11,529 --> 01:54:14,170
You missed like two lines there. You gotta go back and fix it.

749
01:54:14,170 --> 01:54:20,010
You gotta go back and fix it right now. Jacob fix it now.

750
01:54:20,010 --> 01:54:24,170
Okay which line? Two lines down. It should say they

751
01:54:24,170 --> 01:54:38,390
and plus six. Hurry the fuck up Jacob.

752
01:54:38,390 --> 01:55:06,039
You had bad grammar. There was an extra T.

753
01:55:06,039 --> 01:55:09,239
Oh hey I know that you're clocking out of work here in

754
01:55:09,239 --> 01:55:12,439
like the next 30 seconds or so. Oh but can you make

755
01:55:12,439 --> 01:55:16,359
we need six more hamburgers made right now. Go!

756
01:55:16,359 --> 01:56:18,140
I'm gonna get it right now. Oh my god it's so floaty.

757
01:56:18,140 --> 01:56:51,319
Whee! It's fucking easy. Thank you. I don't want to watch this every

758
01:56:51,319 --> 01:57:04,020
time. Just let me jump on it. God Nintendo come on. The chief took

759
01:57:04,020 --> 01:57:06,659
my cloud. Can't believe it. Don't tell the chief I said that.

760
01:57:06,739 --> 01:57:12,100
Hello. I'm ready. 26 percent building the whole damn castle

761
01:57:12,100 --> 01:57:16,100
today. Do you hear? What? What? I'm sorry. I

762
01:57:16,100 --> 01:57:19,779
did my static. There's a little bit of frame drop there. What'd you say Jeremy?

763
01:57:19,779 --> 01:57:34,789
Building the whole castle tonight. Snake blocks in the sky.

764
01:57:34,789 --> 01:57:40,340
This is a 40 hour long campaign. Is it?

765
01:57:40,340 --> 01:57:47,829
No it's not. Is it? It's not actually a 40 hour

766
01:57:47,829 --> 01:57:57,819
campaign. I'm already like 30 percent of the way done. It's been two hours.

767
01:57:57,819 --> 01:58:02,619
Two, four, six, eight. I'll do this like six and a half, eight hours.

768
01:58:02,619 --> 01:58:06,119
I need to practice to be able to do the multiplayer levels. You think this

769
01:58:06,119 --> 01:58:20,649
is the last Mario Maker 2 stream? Yes you think so.

770
01:58:20,649 --> 01:58:27,340
Uh I don't know. It might be. I messed up.

771
01:58:27,340 --> 01:58:40,819
How do I get that? I think I missed my opportunity to get it.

772
01:58:40,819 --> 01:58:53,109
No I didn't. Hold on. It's all right. I do have a terrible record with

773
01:58:53,109 --> 01:58:58,630
Mario games. Yeah. But correct me if I'm wrong. As of two

774
01:58:58,630 --> 01:59:02,779
hours into the stream last Mario Maker stream,

775
01:59:02,779 --> 01:59:05,979
I was already talking about... I was talking about problems with the

776
01:59:05,979 --> 01:59:09,340
controller. So I got input lag right? And then it

777
01:59:09,340 --> 01:59:16,550
was already like a huge problem. Remember? I remember that. That shit

778
01:59:16,550 --> 01:59:23,430
was on the Wii U. The Wii U's controller. I was on like

779
01:59:23,430 --> 01:59:26,229
the big brick controller. I don't think I even had the

780
01:59:26,229 --> 01:59:38,619
the... Yeah. No. That's one of the reasons why.

781
01:59:38,619 --> 01:59:46,630
And it was all stained and shit. I think I blew that opportunity. Do I have to ride

782
01:59:46,630 --> 01:59:55,689
this? Wow. You can ride it? Don't crush my head!

783
01:59:55,689 --> 02:00:05,449
Cool. This is fucking radical. Oh I thought I was gonna... I thought

784
02:00:05,449 --> 02:00:21,750
I was gonna just shrink. I don't like this shit either. Like you

785
02:00:21,750 --> 02:00:37,880
meant to get called into your boss's office in this place.

786
02:00:37,880 --> 02:00:48,329
That just... That just murdered me. That double tapped me I think.

787
02:00:48,409 --> 02:01:03,979
Get out of here. I don't need you. You can do that?

788
02:01:03,979 --> 02:01:11,689
Why can I do that? I don't understand what the

789
02:01:11,689 --> 02:01:34,180
purpose of that is quite at the moment. What's it for?

790
02:01:34,500 --> 02:01:43,689
Watch out for the... Okay there it is. I can't see. Don't go forward.

791
02:01:43,689 --> 02:01:54,520
What? That was gritty. I missed the flag.

792
02:01:54,520 --> 02:02:10,520
Should I just... Wait. There's a pipe here.

793
02:02:10,520 --> 02:02:30,149
Wait. That was... I don't know. I'm a weird cough.

794
02:02:30,149 --> 02:02:33,239
I wanted to say something but I had nothing to say so that was my body's

795
02:02:33,239 --> 02:02:47,770
instinctual response. It was just a cough. Did I die or he died?

796
02:02:47,770 --> 02:03:07,779
I think he did. Yeah. How much money do I got? A thousand?

797
02:03:07,779 --> 02:03:15,590
I think I can do some other builds here. What do you got for me?

798
02:03:15,590 --> 02:03:18,869
Making great progress. This design is too perfect. Almost too perfect.

799
02:03:18,869 --> 02:03:23,659
We have a new building option. Let's go with

800
02:03:23,659 --> 02:03:40,779
West Hall, second floor. I am certain. Construction is underway. How big is this

801
02:03:40,779 --> 02:03:45,140
castle? Square footage wise. Have they ever

802
02:03:45,140 --> 02:03:50,460
released that information? Can you look up the Mario castle on

803
02:03:50,460 --> 02:03:54,439
Zillow? That would be a cute idea. Don't you

804
02:03:54,439 --> 02:04:01,340
think so? Imagine like Zillow or one of these other

805
02:04:01,340 --> 02:04:04,220
places did a like oh this is not a good idea at all.

806
02:04:04,220 --> 02:04:10,710
No one would use this and it'd be stupid. Never mind.

807
02:04:10,710 --> 02:04:14,920
Twister. If you press B as you enter the twister you'll be thrown skywards.

808
02:04:14,920 --> 02:04:22,970
Yeah I know. Twisting through the desert sands.

809
02:04:22,970 --> 02:04:26,409
It could be a cute April Fools gag. Yeah I mean maybe.

810
02:04:26,409 --> 02:04:30,659
You can scroll through photos of inside the castle and tell you how

811
02:04:30,659 --> 02:04:33,619
many square footage it is and then you get to the price and you

812
02:04:33,619 --> 02:04:38,500
go Mario how the fuck can you afford that?

813
02:04:38,500 --> 02:04:47,260
And then you check the estimate. Find out what like your

814
02:04:47,260 --> 02:04:54,569
mortgage estimate would be for Peach's castle.

815
02:04:54,569 --> 02:04:58,649
$61,000 a month's estimate. I can't. I don't think I can live there.

816
02:04:58,649 --> 02:05:37,050
That's it? Got it. Geez. Whoa whoa whoa easy. B. B.

817
02:05:37,050 --> 02:05:57,659
Oh my god. Say the line. What line? Cake Mario?

818
02:05:57,659 --> 02:06:21,460
Do I weigh enough to get this? I have to wait till it goes all the way to the other side.

819
02:06:21,460 --> 02:07:22,819
Damn it. Not bad. 107 coins so far. I'm gonna run out of time though.

820
02:07:22,819 --> 02:07:35,979
That felt pretty damn good. All right what's the cost for the other ones?

821
02:07:35,979 --> 02:07:46,939
What's that thing over there? There's a number muncher over there. Why?

822
02:07:46,939 --> 02:07:54,550
Looks like you've been hard at work. I suppose it's time I get back to work

823
02:07:54,550 --> 02:08:05,109
myself. Adios. Mr. Eraser.

824
02:08:05,109 --> 02:08:09,300
Sorry I'm gonna go chew on some prime numbers. I'll be back in a few

825
02:08:09,300 --> 02:08:20,840
hours. Come on. That was cute. That was

826
02:08:20,840 --> 02:08:34,869
cute. That was cute. From a split on that one. The way of the shell. Oh it

827
02:08:34,869 --> 02:08:39,449
was the begone rotten mushroom. I bought some

828
02:08:39,449 --> 02:08:43,430
mushrooms for a new recipe but I left them in the car and now they've rotten.

829
02:08:43,430 --> 02:08:46,550
Rotten and vengeful. You're going to have to outrun them if you want the

830
02:08:46,550 --> 02:08:59,079
reward. Begone rotten mushroom. Outrun the mushrooms.

831
02:08:59,079 --> 02:09:11,539
This is a pretty awesome Halloween level. I did the joke before too.

832
02:09:11,539 --> 02:09:13,859
Hold on. Let me do the same joke that I've done already like a

833
02:09:13,859 --> 02:09:49,560
thousand times. Get out of my way for a second.

834
02:09:49,560 --> 02:10:13,420
Mocking him. Whoa he can do that. He can't climb right? No. Can I block

835
02:10:13,420 --> 02:10:46,359
him down here? No. Wait. Holy shit. Don't do that far.

836
02:10:46,359 --> 02:10:50,699
You blew everything. You're making this. What?

837
02:10:50,699 --> 02:11:22,840
How much money? 674. Need more coins. Where we at? Did I do all the

838
02:11:22,840 --> 02:11:25,159
following? I got a lot to do down here.

839
02:11:25,159 --> 02:11:34,220
Bonsai bill ambush. Guahaha. I've got an army of bonsai bills guarding

840
02:11:34,220 --> 02:11:36,699
this place. Hoping to surprise Mario by sneaking up

841
02:11:36,699 --> 02:11:39,020
behind him. Any of you chumps out there desperate

842
02:11:39,020 --> 02:11:41,420
enough to test it before Mario shows up?

843
02:11:41,420 --> 02:11:47,609
Get to the end and get paid. Good luck out there.

844
02:11:47,609 --> 02:11:53,050
Go talk to the dog? I will after I get another thousand dollars.

845
02:11:53,050 --> 02:12:05,050
Talk to the dog or I'm unsubbing. Just hold on.

846
02:12:05,050 --> 02:12:21,529
Cat. I like the bullets in this. They're pretty cool. It's a nice touch.

847
02:12:21,529 --> 02:12:24,569
Who made this? I made this. Oh they're cool.

848
02:12:24,569 --> 02:12:28,390
I didn't know there was a get here.

849
02:12:28,710 --> 02:12:38,020
What was going through your thought process? What the fuck just happened?

850
02:12:38,020 --> 02:12:54,779
Oh. I had the checkpoint. I didn't press up.

851
02:12:54,779 --> 02:13:11,350
Wait a minute. I can turn it around? Just let them destroy everything.

852
02:13:11,350 --> 02:13:23,960
What? Oh wow. Missed coins. He missed coins. I don't- it's all right.

853
02:13:23,960 --> 02:13:31,270
I had to jump on one of their heads to get this.

854
02:13:31,270 --> 02:13:35,829
That guy down. I gotta get on the cloud. Did the cloud fall?

855
02:13:35,829 --> 02:14:03,369
No. I can't just do this. Of course. This seems kind of out of place.

856
02:14:03,369 --> 02:14:06,729
Fur suit. Guys, Mario has been wearing fur suits

857
02:14:06,729 --> 02:14:24,539
for 25 years. This ain't new. Seasaw catapults. Jump and tilt

858
02:14:24,539 --> 02:14:27,260
down to do a ground pound onto a seesaw to send anything on the other

859
02:14:27,260 --> 02:14:29,739
end flying.

860
02:14:36,470 --> 02:14:43,060
I love little cute Mario. What a perfect thing to have on a key chain.

861
02:14:43,060 --> 02:14:49,720
Don't you think so? Or cake Mario. I think cake Mario I think is my

862
02:14:49,720 --> 02:14:54,199
what I would put on a key chain. They definitely have it.

863
02:14:54,199 --> 02:15:18,460
I don't pound this, but why would I ground pound any of this crap?

864
02:15:18,460 --> 02:15:28,100
What? What's up with that? I just like was-

865
02:15:28,100 --> 02:15:31,220
I just like broke his neck. I can't like sever his head. Like I can't

866
02:15:31,220 --> 02:15:46,520
break his neck right there. Yeah right. I always thought you

867
02:15:46,520 --> 02:15:48,439
couldn't kill that thing, but it just got angry.

868
02:15:48,439 --> 02:15:55,029
Break that. I get it a lot. You know, the thing is

869
02:15:55,109 --> 02:16:10,500
let's see if I can get that. Okay, hold on. Not quite.

870
02:16:10,500 --> 02:16:18,100
Shit. All right, I gotta shut the fuck up. Wait, can I skip that?

871
02:16:18,100 --> 02:16:30,699
He's gonna be squiggling around in there. There's probably a

872
02:16:30,699 --> 02:16:35,399
coin over there. I'm gonna just give it a look. See, he

873
02:16:35,399 --> 02:16:38,489
does get mad.

874
02:16:45,590 --> 02:17:01,379
Whatever. It is bright here. It's fine. Whatever. It's 10 coins.

875
02:17:01,379 --> 02:17:09,260
That's nothing. I thought I said I could launch him.

876
02:17:12,790 --> 02:17:15,590
I can do it from the bottom.

877
02:17:20,809 --> 02:17:24,729
Yeah, see? I'm not sure what that even did for me, but

878
02:17:24,729 --> 02:17:28,170
I gotta get it. You're right. I'm looking in the chat right now. People

879
02:17:28,170 --> 02:17:32,170
are just like, you fucking idiot. Stupid. Like, how dare you miss that?

880
02:17:32,170 --> 02:17:40,790
And I'm like, geez. I mean, it's just Mario. It's

881
02:17:40,790 --> 02:17:45,579
just Mario, guys. I'm done. Somebody said I hate you in all

882
02:17:45,579 --> 02:17:49,450
capitals like 10 times in a row. Just like,

883
02:17:49,450 --> 02:17:59,860
relax. It's all right. It's gonna be okay.

884
02:17:59,860 --> 02:18:26,340
Just Mario. Just Mario. Ooh. Now, that was fun. Shit.

885
02:18:26,340 --> 02:18:37,909
What am I? How do I do that? I'm gonna go from here to there to there.

886
02:18:37,909 --> 02:18:43,350
What?! It's the buttons. The button. I fat-fingered it because I'm

887
02:18:43,350 --> 02:18:48,340
using the Nintendo Switch. My thumb.

888
02:18:48,340 --> 02:18:53,500
Using my thumb. Luigi, get out of my face.

889
02:18:53,500 --> 02:18:56,299
The Switch. I'm using the Switch controller and sometimes when you

890
02:18:56,299 --> 02:18:58,139
press one button on the Switch, you press

891
02:18:58,139 --> 02:19:05,430
all of them because they're like sprinkles on your controller. It's like

892
02:19:05,430 --> 02:19:08,149
having chocolate chips on your controller.

893
02:19:08,149 --> 02:19:20,739
Sorry, I pressed all the chocolate chips at the same time.

894
02:19:20,739 --> 02:19:35,299
I don't even have big hands. Yeah, I kind of do, but not that big.

895
02:19:35,299 --> 02:20:06,950
If I fuck this up again. What's underneath this?

896
02:20:06,950 --> 02:20:10,309
Sorry, I pressed every single little like dinner mint

897
02:20:10,309 --> 02:20:18,040
at the same time. Look at those candy dots that were on the sheet of paper.

898
02:20:18,040 --> 02:20:41,690
Those are bigger than the Switch buttons. Dog, dog. All right, all right, all right.

899
02:20:41,690 --> 02:20:47,590
I'll talk to the dog. Bark, bark. I have jobs. Woof.

900
02:20:47,590 --> 02:20:55,049
Woof, woof. Come on, please. Ooh, there's a dog level. Swinging claw escape.

901
02:20:55,049 --> 02:20:57,690
Arf, Arf, I have a job for you to do. I keep getting caught by the

902
02:20:57,690 --> 02:21:02,090
swinging claws hanging around my walking route. Could you show me a path

903
02:21:02,090 --> 02:21:07,430
I can take to avoid getting grabbed? Reach the goal without using any

904
02:21:07,430 --> 02:21:24,299
swinging claws. Who's a good boy?

905
02:21:24,299 --> 02:21:30,440
Oh, okay. That just like freaked me the fuck out when I looked over there.

906
02:21:30,440 --> 02:21:34,520
All right, don't get grabbed by any of these. I can jump though, right?

907
02:21:34,520 --> 02:22:19,979
Just let that happen. Get grabbed.

908
02:22:20,059 --> 02:22:32,620
Don't get grabbed. Slide. Wait. Okay, now slide.

909
02:22:32,940 --> 02:22:47,100
Sure. Okay, that's fine.

910
02:22:47,579 --> 02:22:53,510
It is a dog level, so it makes sense. I did the same thing again.

911
02:22:53,510 --> 02:23:00,100
I just let it happen again. Like, sometimes I think

912
02:23:00,100 --> 02:23:08,379
if you like split my head open, there'd be watermelon juice in there.

913
02:23:08,379 --> 02:23:17,100
Like, sometimes I think it's just a coconut. Oh!

914
02:23:17,100 --> 02:23:19,659
That was probably, that was so loud. I can tell. I looked over at the

915
02:23:19,659 --> 02:23:31,100
monitor and it was really loud. Okay, I'm safe here, I think.

916
02:23:31,100 --> 02:23:49,270
Where is the other ones? There's going to be another one.

917
02:23:49,270 --> 02:23:55,219
See, the thing is, there was no point in me doing what I was just trying to do.

918
02:23:55,219 --> 02:24:06,870
I, there was no point in that. I just had to go up. I don't know.

919
02:24:06,870 --> 02:24:11,879
Don't do it again. If this happens again, I truly have

920
02:24:11,879 --> 02:24:16,739
like orange juice in my brain. Remember those old

921
02:24:16,739 --> 02:24:21,100
gushers commercials? They would eat the gushers and their heads would

922
02:24:21,100 --> 02:24:39,219
turn into like pears and shit. Don't get grabbed.

923
02:24:39,219 --> 02:24:52,340
Just kill me.

924
02:24:55,299 --> 02:25:21,290
Does it start over button? I have to go down with the ship though.

925
02:25:21,290 --> 02:25:29,139
Literally five coins. Do I really hear that much about it?

926
02:25:29,139 --> 02:25:33,049
Don't even, don't even start talking shit about the jello. I, somebody said

927
02:25:33,049 --> 02:25:36,809
jello and I got immediately angry. Hold on, I will

928
02:25:36,809 --> 02:25:43,430
talk. No, I'm not talking about jello anymore.

929
02:25:43,430 --> 02:25:48,069
Jello is jello. Jello is jelly. I can't even fucking believe it. I've

930
02:25:48,069 --> 02:25:50,870
I'm already getting heated. I'm already getting like, I can feel my

931
02:25:50,870 --> 02:26:03,260
like blood. Don't do that. Just get the thing.

932
02:26:03,260 --> 02:26:09,739
Jelly is jello. Give me a break. Jelly is not always made with gelatin.

933
02:26:09,739 --> 02:26:13,739
I can't even, I'm already getting mad. I can stop. Stop, stop. Just play.

934
02:26:13,739 --> 02:26:34,500
Stop. You think I'm gonna go for two coins?

935
02:26:34,500 --> 02:26:45,770
They respawn. Okay, wait. Go now. Drop it. Oh shit.

936
02:26:45,770 --> 02:26:56,120
Home stretch. Don't blow it. I don't care if I didn't touch it.

937
02:26:56,120 --> 02:27:00,760
Jelly is bones. No, jello is always made with gelatin. Jelly is not

938
02:27:00,760 --> 02:27:04,649
always made with gelatin. Sometimes it's fruit preserves.

939
02:27:04,649 --> 02:27:11,450
So therefore, chat was I-N-C-O-R-R-E-C-T.

940
02:27:11,450 --> 02:27:29,399
Another job for the dog? Sure. When was the last time you guys tried to

941
02:27:29,399 --> 02:27:35,450
spread jello on a piece of toast? Really?

942
02:27:35,450 --> 02:27:44,260
What the, you can't, that's not gonna happen.

943
02:27:44,260 --> 02:27:47,700
Arf, Arf, I have a job for you. The nights have been so cold lately.

944
02:27:47,700 --> 02:27:50,500
Could you bring me something that will shelter me from the storm?

945
02:27:50,500 --> 02:28:03,270
Reach the goal while wearing a dry bones shell.

946
02:28:03,270 --> 02:28:21,420
If you spread jello on your toast. What? Hold on. What the fuck?

947
02:28:21,420 --> 02:28:29,829
I didn't even get a chance. I can't see where we're going.

948
02:28:29,829 --> 02:28:48,860
Oh, thank god his arrows. Oh boy. Okay. I think we're safe. Can I jump on these?

949
02:28:48,860 --> 02:28:55,739
Yes, I can. Yes, I can. No, you can't. Yes, I can.

950
02:28:55,739 --> 02:28:59,659
You can't. Yes, I can. Did you just watch? God.

951
02:28:59,659 --> 02:29:07,180
What the fuck?

952
02:29:12,979 --> 02:29:18,379
I'm gonna get it. He doesn't even want to take it. Get in the shell!

953
02:29:18,379 --> 02:29:41,290
Get in the shell! What the hell? How is that even possible? This purple jello.

954
02:29:41,290 --> 02:29:44,889
Ah, every time. I don't stop. Don't say that anymore.

955
02:29:44,889 --> 02:30:05,610
Does he have a glass break? I'm cutting this way too close.

956
02:30:05,610 --> 02:30:08,729
Like, honestly, I don't, I don't, I just, I don't care. I don't need to think

957
02:30:08,729 --> 02:30:11,129
about this. I don't care about the world's most

958
02:30:11,129 --> 02:30:16,250
disgusting snack. Like, who cares? The jello, jelly, who

959
02:30:16,250 --> 02:30:28,629
cares? Doesn't matter. I, who, that doesn't matter. Who cares?

960
02:30:28,629 --> 02:30:58,649
Got it. Oh, fuck. Um, should I go? Oh shit! I got it. Imagine being Mario

961
02:30:58,649 --> 02:31:16,700
right now. What a nightmare. 87 coins. Cool.

962
02:31:16,700 --> 02:31:21,159
I got enough money now. Is that it for the dog?

963
02:31:21,159 --> 02:31:28,020
Ooh, I got him a dog house. He's got more. Should I just do all the dog missions?

964
02:31:28,020 --> 02:31:37,770
No, I, we gotta start a build here. Looking glorious.

965
02:31:37,770 --> 02:31:40,889
We have new building options now. Cool.

966
02:31:40,889 --> 02:31:47,459
West hall cannon. Main hall three. Main hall three. Let's just get it done.

967
02:31:55,049 --> 02:32:04,309
Do auto mission. I will. I'll do it right now.

968
02:32:04,309 --> 02:32:11,930
Got another job. This is a full-on four star difficult. First time we've seen

969
02:32:11,930 --> 02:32:15,049
it. Tonight, chain chomp chiller and I get something.

970
02:32:15,049 --> 02:32:20,620
What do I get? A mystery t-shirt. The path I usually

971
02:32:20,620 --> 02:32:23,659
take is littered with chain chomps. Could you show me if it's possible to

972
02:32:23,659 --> 02:32:35,850
walk through there without jumping? Can't wait.

973
02:32:35,850 --> 02:32:53,079
Get Luigi on speed dial for this one. I did it.

974
02:32:53,879 --> 02:33:00,069
This is gonna suck. What? Wait. Does this one

975
02:33:00,069 --> 02:33:13,819
fly? Some of them don't. Some of them go fly forward.

976
02:33:13,819 --> 02:33:33,139
Oh no. No. How am I gonna? Okay. Just get me to a flag.

977
02:33:33,139 --> 02:33:44,090
I don't know when to go. Right now. Okay, hold on.

978
02:33:44,090 --> 02:33:48,579
Is he gonna go up? Did I put this down? Should I put this down? I'm gonna put

979
02:33:48,579 --> 02:33:55,110
it down. Should I bring it with me? I'm gonna bring it with me. Might need

980
02:33:55,110 --> 02:33:57,829
it. I'm gonna make him jump up there. I'm

981
02:33:58,229 --> 02:34:18,870
gonna bring it with me. How was that four stars and the other

982
02:34:18,870 --> 02:34:21,909
one was three? The other one was harder than that and it was like two.

983
02:34:21,909 --> 02:34:39,989
I got the reset dress. I want it. You can

984
02:34:39,989 --> 02:34:51,059
equip the outfit in the course world. Is that it for the dog?

985
02:34:51,059 --> 02:35:01,239
I got the dog's shirt. Need some more coins to get some jobs over here.

986
02:35:01,239 --> 02:35:05,079
Let me get through these. Tunnel to the dark side of the

987
02:35:05,079 --> 02:35:07,559
moon. I think I tunnel all the way to

988
02:35:07,559 --> 02:35:09,559
the other side of the moon because everything is upside down there. It's

989
02:35:09,559 --> 02:35:12,549
pretty neat but kind of disorienting.

990
02:35:12,549 --> 02:35:14,950
If you want to slide down a slope you gotta hit

991
02:35:14,950 --> 02:35:21,979
up. I really didn't think that I was gonna

992
02:35:21,979 --> 02:35:26,600
have this much fun in the random build the castle single player

993
02:35:26,600 --> 02:35:48,379
but I kind of am. Wait. On you? Yes. Can I bounce you up the wall?

994
02:35:48,379 --> 02:36:00,969
Oh my god. I didn't mean to do that. I turned the wrong way.

995
02:36:00,969 --> 02:36:17,479
Okay, I'm gonna bounce him up the wall. Just getting him.

996
02:36:17,479 --> 02:36:30,680
Oh. Well now that makes more sense. Upside down.

997
02:36:30,680 --> 02:36:38,420
No, wait. Check the other thing. That's a death, isn't it?

998
02:36:38,420 --> 02:36:52,520
Uh. At least I know I don't have to do that.

999
02:36:52,520 --> 02:37:11,770
Just go in, grab, turn, run, jump. Nice. All right. Is there a point to

1000
02:37:11,770 --> 02:37:16,809
that? Anything over here? I don't think there's anything over

1001
02:37:16,809 --> 02:37:30,059
there. Slide? You can't slide as uh Cake Mario.

1002
02:37:30,059 --> 02:37:34,889
At least not upside down. Oh shit. I thought I was gonna go through.

1003
02:37:37,299 --> 02:37:57,510
Oh boy. Watch out. I can't get up there. I can get up there now, right? Yeah.

1004
02:37:57,510 --> 02:38:16,819
Just flip the switch upside down. I mean you

1005
02:38:16,819 --> 02:38:38,180
could do that. Maybe. German nuke the chat.

1006
02:38:38,180 --> 02:38:53,829
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1007
02:38:53,829 --> 02:39:02,809
All right. That was as if like a toddler was like walking towards

1008
02:39:02,809 --> 02:39:08,250
the stove. And like reaching up to the stove.

1009
02:39:08,250 --> 02:39:23,909
All right. Be careful, careful, careful. I can't kill the uh spike

1010
02:39:23,909 --> 02:39:33,239
head. I feel like if I jump too hard, high, it's gonna kill me off screen.

1011
02:39:33,239 --> 02:39:39,620
Is that gonna happen? No, but I can die. I can fall off here though, right?

1012
02:39:39,620 --> 02:39:42,899
Will that happen if I fall off here? I think so.

1013
02:39:42,899 --> 02:39:49,690
Just careful. Oh my god, that's gonna happen if I do that.

1014
02:39:49,690 --> 02:39:57,479
Can I get in this door? I just pressed down.

1015
02:39:57,479 --> 02:40:09,030
Don't go that far. I can get it twice, can I?

1016
02:40:09,030 --> 02:40:21,559
No, I can't. No, that's not gonna happen.

1017
02:40:21,559 --> 02:40:31,860
Super Mario, Super Mario, Super Mario. We've got a game of the year contender

1018
02:40:31,860 --> 02:40:35,290
here. I just pressed a button on my like OBS.

1019
02:40:35,290 --> 02:40:46,260
Am I still streaming? I think, yeah, I am. I like pressed my key. I like

1020
02:40:46,260 --> 02:40:48,739
mashed like a couple buttons on the keyboard.

1021
02:40:48,739 --> 02:40:52,579
Stop streaming is highlighted though. So I'm kind of,

1022
02:40:52,579 --> 02:41:05,719
I'm just gonna move my mouse to the other monitor. I said that's all these,

1023
02:41:05,719 --> 02:41:09,819
right? All the way up through 21. This one's

1024
02:41:09,819 --> 02:41:15,979
an easy one. I like easy ones. Am I gonna do a

1025
02:41:15,979 --> 02:41:21,059
Jerma Game Awards at the end of the year?

1026
02:41:21,059 --> 02:41:24,819
I'm probably not. I don't really do that anymore. Not since um

1027
02:41:24,819 --> 02:41:27,860
the YouTube days and even when I did it on YouTube.

1028
02:41:27,860 --> 02:41:32,739
It's kind of a joke anyways. I usually just tell you

1029
02:41:32,739 --> 02:41:50,969
I had to obey. I'm sorry. I was sinking, guys.

1030
02:41:50,969 --> 02:42:12,379
Gonna jump eventually. Oh, no. This is why I need Yoshi. Can I go

1031
02:42:12,379 --> 02:42:17,399
get him again? I want that coin. That motherfucker is

1032
02:42:17,399 --> 02:42:22,700
drowning down there. Come here, Yoshi. Where are you?

1033
02:42:23,719 --> 02:42:54,889
Yoshi. Come on. Hurry up. That's my opinion on Anthony Banthly for 2020.

1034
02:42:54,889 --> 02:42:59,000
We don't talk politics on this stream.

1035
02:43:00,700 --> 02:43:05,979
That candidate sucks. I just killed the thing that I wanted to come all the

1036
02:43:05,979 --> 02:43:14,540
way back into Respawn. I don't even care. Just go in there.

1037
02:43:14,540 --> 02:43:39,799
Oh yeah, I forgot. If you have a shell, you swim better. There he is.

1038
02:43:39,879 --> 02:43:45,350
Oh, I can't. I can't lift that bump. Should I do it again?

1039
02:43:45,350 --> 02:43:50,059
Should I? Should I do it again? Wait, things are doing?

1040
02:43:50,059 --> 02:44:15,819
I'm not a monster. I thought there was something up there. Where was the 30?

1041
02:44:15,819 --> 02:44:19,260
Some people said there's a 40 hour single player campaign. I don't think

1042
02:44:19,260 --> 02:44:22,139
that you were correct. I think you may have been just a

1043
02:44:22,139 --> 02:44:34,950
slight bit incorrect. Above the clouds, beyond the vines.

1044
02:44:34,950 --> 02:44:49,780
Vines growing all over it. Be my guest.

1045
02:44:49,780 --> 02:44:52,659
40 hour campaign. The game's been up for like 18 hours. Yeah, how would you even

1046
02:44:52,659 --> 02:45:02,500
know that? Unless like the press told you that.

1047
02:45:02,500 --> 02:45:08,340
Wait, I gotta go from keychain Mario to like grown-up Mario. There we go.

1048
02:45:08,340 --> 02:45:34,120
Which side? 40 hours of journalist difficulty?

1049
02:45:35,620 --> 02:45:47,500
Yeah? What were you gonna say? Tell me again?

1050
02:45:47,500 --> 02:45:53,239
What was it? Of journalist difficulty is what you said?

1051
02:45:57,690 --> 02:46:26,329
I almost just did it. I don't know why I just freaked out there. It was just half.

1052
02:46:26,329 --> 02:46:39,420
I love that like, it's kind of like the way.

1053
02:46:40,379 --> 02:46:45,500
What is it? What am I doing? What the fuck happened?

1054
02:46:45,500 --> 02:46:48,219
Can they go sideways? That's what it is. I didn't think they could go

1055
02:46:48,219 --> 02:46:50,780
sideways. They've evolved. They never used to be able to do

1056
02:46:50,780 --> 02:47:08,090
this shit. No! It's all right, let me get that.

1057
02:47:09,610 --> 02:47:15,930
Luigi, you would have died to that too. That would laugh my ass off

1058
02:47:15,930 --> 02:47:20,010
if there was like a problem with the game or something. It was a bug.

1059
02:47:20,010 --> 02:47:24,649
And Luigi got fucking smoked in the first 10 seconds.

1060
02:47:32,120 --> 02:47:47,989
Luigi's gotta call somebody else. Wario gets on the phone.

1061
02:47:48,069 --> 02:48:10,020
This game is a bullshit. This goddamn candy controller, I swear to God.

1062
02:48:10,020 --> 02:48:14,409
I could probably eat one of the switch controls and be fine. I really think

1063
02:48:14,409 --> 02:48:17,530
that. I could eat it and it would just,

1064
02:48:17,530 --> 02:48:29,850
it would come out be fine. Where am I? Good cloud.

1065
02:48:29,850 --> 02:48:49,510
This is gonna be risky. Risky play! What? Why did he

1066
02:48:49,510 --> 02:49:02,489
magnetize the other direction? I think I'm safe.

1067
02:49:02,489 --> 02:49:12,569
You're never safe though. Hold on. What is that? I don't, can you skip like the whole level?

1068
02:49:12,569 --> 02:49:32,950
Did I just put that out of reach? What the hell is the point of this?

1069
02:49:32,950 --> 02:49:57,270
It's the dev exit. Listen, I, the, I've got, I,

1070
02:49:57,270 --> 02:50:02,069
Mario, in all the Mario games, if you go over the flag, it just

1071
02:50:02,069 --> 02:50:07,819
stops you and you're at the top of the flag. Not in this one.

1072
02:50:07,819 --> 02:50:18,069
What do you mean not true? That's true. If you go over the flag

1073
02:50:18,069 --> 02:50:22,069
in the original Mario game, you, no that's right, that happens like the

1074
02:50:22,069 --> 02:50:36,760
first two or three of them that do that. That happens. What do I think about

1075
02:50:36,760 --> 02:50:41,819
chocolate pudding? It has bones in it. Chocolate pudding is fine, but chocolate

1076
02:50:41,819 --> 02:50:46,360
pudding is not jello. I mean, it could be. It could be chocolate

1077
02:50:46,360 --> 02:50:51,909
jello. Chocolate pudding is not jelly. I'm done.

1078
02:50:51,909 --> 02:50:55,110
No. Why did you do this to me? I'm not, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm

1079
02:50:55,110 --> 02:51:08,760
playing Mario. Goomba clubhouse. This sounds fun.

1080
02:51:08,760 --> 02:51:11,399
I love goombas. I love them so much that I made them a clubhouse. Aren't

1081
02:51:11,399 --> 02:51:15,079
they so cute when they scoot through those clear pipes?

1082
02:51:15,079 --> 02:51:19,719
Someone please go hang out with them and stomp on their heads.

1083
02:51:19,719 --> 02:51:41,829
I'll pay you. Wait, I think I have to have the rocket boost.

1084
02:51:41,829 --> 02:52:09,370
Yep, hold on. Three rocket boosts. Holy shit, I didn't die.

1085
02:52:09,370 --> 02:52:30,309
The audio is desynced. I thought it was going to crash.

1086
02:52:30,309 --> 02:52:39,079
You can't crash in the tube? Okay, what the fuck am I doing? It's

1087
02:52:39,079 --> 02:52:48,459
desynced. So listen, um, let me, I can do a test here.

1088
02:52:48,459 --> 02:52:50,780
Ready?

1089
02:52:56,309 --> 02:53:11,540
Are we synced? The audio is ahead. The game audio. Or me. Hold on.

1090
02:53:11,540 --> 02:53:18,090
So wait, hold on. You like, you know, me by 60 milliseconds?

1091
02:53:18,090 --> 02:53:22,870
So I'm a little late. So like, okay, let me see if it happens. Tell me if it

1092
02:53:22,870 --> 02:53:31,879
happens when I do this. Ready? Clear it, clear it, clear it.

1093
02:53:32,040 --> 02:53:36,459
Ready. One, two, three.

1094
02:53:45,909 --> 02:53:55,370
Game audio is ahead. Hold on. All right, ready. Clear it, clear the

1095
02:53:55,370 --> 02:53:59,139
clear.

1096
02:54:11,739 --> 02:54:39,459
Good. All right, here we go. I need all these keys. Oh, that's how

1097
02:54:39,459 --> 02:55:10,069
get this 10. all right so where do we go now? I'm thinking like a dank right here. if I just fell

1098
02:55:10,069 --> 02:55:35,559
down the hardest thing to die in, it might be time to throw myself. so we're in the middle. no stop!

1099
02:55:36,440 --> 02:55:44,180
coins on this side, coins above, coins down, coins back up.

1100
02:55:44,180 --> 02:55:55,659
oh, let's go all the way around. that's all right, this is the exit. all right, go this way.

1101
02:55:58,139 --> 02:56:09,510
I can't, like, go, I can't, you can't tele-frag them. I need one more key over there. what?

1102
02:56:14,819 --> 02:56:16,420
all right, let's, I'm, it's fine, I got it.

1103
02:56:18,420 --> 02:56:32,459
unless, wait, no, no, no, no, no, it's over here. there's probably not, there's no screen,

1104
02:56:32,459 --> 02:56:58,729
right? it's just this. I didn't get it. so bald. I can't, what's my voice doing?

1105
02:57:04,299 --> 02:57:16,040
main hall three. is there a fourth floor to the castle? I don't remember. oh man, oh fuck, oh

1106
02:57:16,040 --> 02:57:24,149
shit. oh man, this is bad. we've got a problem. I shouldn't say this out loud, so here. oh,

1107
02:57:24,149 --> 02:57:29,270
red toad got kidnapped while we were taking an unauthorized break. please bring red toad back

1108
02:57:29,270 --> 02:57:37,319
before the chief notices. we're all busted. no, it's not worth screaming. it's only, it's been

1109
02:57:37,319 --> 02:57:43,799
three hours. if I screamed, I was going to, I, I, my voice would be gone in, like, the next 45

1110
02:57:43,799 --> 02:58:04,409
minutes. reach the goal with one toad. fine, I'll do it myself. wee. why did I just get the,

1111
02:58:04,409 --> 02:58:19,110
this is low gravity. oh, this is the best song, I think, in the last 10 years or so.

1112
02:58:19,110 --> 02:58:39,819
you know. we're dead. he weighed me down. toad, you weighed me down. that's what happened.

1113
02:58:42,299 --> 02:58:55,559
hey, there's like that advanced technique where you can do that. you're kidding me. why were

1114
02:58:55,559 --> 02:59:10,469
you just standing still? don't, how did I not, I almost died in the same spot.

1115
02:59:13,159 --> 02:59:48,969
is it yellow fish? that's a 30 over there. can you jump? jump. oh, oh my god, what's

1116
02:59:48,969 --> 03:00:11,239
happening? oh my god, I, I, that hurt my body. I fell off that cliff. peek, today's peek the

1117
03:00:11,239 --> 03:00:14,680
mic day apparently. yeah, apparently. I'm not going to peek the mic again, it's not going

1118
03:00:14,680 --> 03:00:40,219
to happen. I have to get toad. if I accidentally press the ground pound again,

1119
03:00:45,299 --> 03:00:51,579
there was a time when you had to press down and like right or left trigger at the same time.

1120
03:00:52,780 --> 03:01:24,139
not just down. no, no, don't start over.

1121
03:01:27,020 --> 03:01:38,040
I wanted to get out of the pause menu. accidental button press god. it's all right.

1122
03:01:39,079 --> 03:02:06,100
that's not worth it. it's 10. who cares. it's not worth it. it's not worth it. I'm freaking

1123
03:02:06,100 --> 03:02:23,659
out again. jump up the, oh, toad, come here. oh, it's got my sights on me. toad, get back

1124
03:02:23,659 --> 03:02:43,610
over. I'm not trying to peek the mic. this is a bunch of free one-ups.

1125
03:03:42,299 --> 03:03:49,020
almost enough, right? red toad is back.

1126
03:03:52,389 --> 03:04:05,579
I think one-ups I would have if I didn't do the ground pound. bark, bark. let's go talk to

1127
03:04:05,579 --> 03:04:17,000
red toad and see if red toad has anything for us to do. something cool. red toad,

1128
03:04:18,899 --> 03:04:22,340
thank you so much for saving me. that was legitimately terrifying, but they just let me

1129
03:04:22,340 --> 03:04:28,040
go out of the blue. not that I'm complaining. maybe I was taken by mistake. why can I just

1130
03:04:28,040 --> 03:04:49,139
jump off the edge? sleeping on the job. there you are. hey, kid, want to help me out with a

1131
03:04:49,139 --> 03:04:56,250
job? you help me out, I'll erase the blocks on top of the pipe over there. molten rain.

1132
03:04:56,250 --> 03:05:02,069
your target this time is seven lava bubbles. once that, you don't know how to take out

1133
03:05:02,069 --> 03:05:08,170
lava bubbles. you want to pack your lunch too? don't worry so much, amigo. you'll figure it

1134
03:05:08,170 --> 03:05:24,760
out. defeat seven bubbles. I'll try. mario's like 40. mario's way older than 40.

1135
03:05:39,159 --> 03:06:21,700
oh. 58. get them all. for the true ending. never mind. who cares? give me one.

1136
03:06:21,700 --> 03:07:22,229
all right. take them down. this is the guy that beat dark souls. yeah, this is the guy that beat

1137
03:07:22,229 --> 03:07:43,940
the last boss in securo. the true last boss. stop. settle down. did he just, like, die?

1138
03:07:44,739 --> 03:07:55,110
he just used his whole head to do that. is he all right? anymore? he's got more.

1139
03:08:00,600 --> 03:08:07,500
erase the blocks gumming up the path over there. spiny busters. kill 15 spines.

1140
03:08:08,219 --> 03:08:12,340
use whatever tools you have at your disposal. adios. I'm counting on you.

1141
03:08:24,469 --> 03:09:03,500
so how do you give her to be, uh, spines? I get it. okay, I got them, but it doesn't work.

1142
03:09:03,500 --> 03:09:28,090
come on. I can get it. ready? oh, no, no. I got it. I'm fine. touch it? I clearly touched

1143
03:09:28,090 --> 03:09:45,350
that. that was pretty clear. get rid of the path here. sweet. nice work, kid. out. off those

1144
03:09:45,350 --> 03:09:50,549
blocks now. all right, uh, you lousy bunch of blocks. this is going to hurt me a lot more

1145
03:09:50,549 --> 03:10:24,309
than it hurt you. adios. that's it. there's 10 coins. I make 10 coins in my sleep. you help

1146
03:10:24,309 --> 03:10:28,229
me out. I'll give you some fancy clothes. I got $1,229. I make that in my sleep.

1147
03:10:28,950 --> 03:10:37,850
a single pom-pom. this time your target is a single pom-pom. they probably know

1148
03:10:37,850 --> 03:10:44,200
you're coming, so expect a trap. adios. and I get a t-shirt. defeat one pom-pom.

1149
03:10:48,600 --> 03:10:55,000
everyone's streaming Mario Maker 2 today? well, it is brand new. brand new game on

1150
03:10:55,000 --> 03:11:30,979
a beloved franchise. reach the goal to defeating all the pom-poms. let me hit you! oh!

1151
03:11:31,379 --> 03:12:04,620
oh, that's the one. you gotta let her do it. what the? one more time. thanks for the key.

1152
03:12:16,950 --> 03:12:25,430
you moving too much? I gotta move enough. so what's the, uh, what I get for, uh,

1153
03:12:26,149 --> 03:12:38,010
clothing? I love it. it's like a cookie monster shirt. can I put these on? or is

1154
03:12:38,010 --> 03:12:44,280
that my me? I think that's my me. what does this put? okay, hold on. where does this go?

1155
03:12:44,280 --> 03:13:08,790
new area. why did you do that? hello. have time for a job? there's something good in you for you.

1156
03:13:12,229 --> 03:13:17,750
house of blocks. we're in the market for a new house, and we need someone to inspect this place

1157
03:13:17,750 --> 03:13:22,649
we found. hit the blocks and climb to the top to check it out. you can also tilt

1158
03:13:22,649 --> 03:13:25,049
and mid or ground pound. hello. I hate doing that.

1159
03:13:37,459 --> 03:13:47,459
so the goal is that it's the climbers. I like the background. start building?

1160
03:13:48,180 --> 03:14:08,229
yeah, so I'm getting too caught up in the cartoon characters. how that works?

1161
03:14:34,709 --> 03:14:38,870
all the way back down. really? oh, please. was this super easy, boy?

1162
03:14:52,360 --> 03:15:14,389
good music. I'll take the music track. okay, get out of the way. I almost did it again.

1163
03:15:33,180 --> 03:15:45,879
can't. get me up there. no! there's a coin! I can get by. I'll just go back.

1164
03:16:00,979 --> 03:16:14,139
whatever. I got plenty of money. it was ten. it wasn't that big of a deal.

1165
03:16:16,260 --> 03:16:25,079
I'm gonna go build the rest of the hall. thank you. all right, I'm gonna make something good.

1166
03:16:25,719 --> 03:16:38,409
buildy buildy, roo roo, miracle roo. oh, cool. I put a special block somewhere.

1167
03:16:39,780 --> 03:16:46,780
well, you just told me where it was. stop being mad. mad? what do you mean mad?

1168
03:16:47,340 --> 03:17:04,889
all right, we got... no, I need to go talk to the chief. we need to start instruction. anyway,

1169
03:17:04,889 --> 03:17:08,969
main hall, third floor is complete. the castle is bursting at the seams with elegance. it's

1170
03:17:08,969 --> 03:17:19,590
looking... it's like looking into a mirror. we have new building options now. west hall cannon.

1171
03:17:21,190 --> 03:17:47,139
that sounds fun. and I can afford the west hall top. 582. west hall doors. do it. I am gonna

1172
03:17:47,139 --> 03:17:59,819
go hit that block though. so what's in the special blocks? why would I ask... chat that question

1173
03:17:59,819 --> 03:18:03,180
when in the time that there's like a five second... three to five second delay, I would have

1174
03:18:03,180 --> 03:18:21,930
already hit it in none. what's wrong with you? I want to punch toad in the mouth so fucking bad.

1175
03:18:21,930 --> 03:18:31,739
why? what's... why would you say something like that? yellow toad's been sleeping.

1176
03:18:33,579 --> 03:18:41,159
paw wake up call. reach the goal after defeating all nine spinies. hit some paw blocks.

1177
03:18:41,159 --> 03:18:55,110
you might be able to wake up this nameless toad. so we're gonna defeat all the spinies. punch him

1178
03:18:55,110 --> 03:19:18,889
in the mouth. where's the other one? just... just... it's done, right? that's it. nine out of

1179
03:19:18,889 --> 03:19:47,319
nine. get out. that was quick. that was cool. 40%. 41... 42%. something like that.

1180
03:19:47,959 --> 03:20:02,149
I had to go through all that to wake him up. why wouldn't I just kick him? I mean like gently.

1181
03:20:02,870 --> 03:20:19,270
or just scream. does it lean down and just be like... hey! hey! wake up! yawn. that was a

1182
03:20:19,270 --> 03:20:23,670
quality nap. couldn't get my hands on the stone that the chief wanted so I took a nap instead.

1183
03:20:23,670 --> 03:20:28,649
would you go and bring me back some stone? let's see. yeah I think this would do.

1184
03:20:29,290 --> 03:20:50,569
it's gonna be easy. reach the goal while holding a stone. bring me a stone. reach

1185
03:20:50,569 --> 03:21:04,940
the goal while holding a stone. where's the stone? one of these? can I break one of these off?

1186
03:21:10,389 --> 03:21:13,590
you didn't mention what stone. you just said a stone.

1187
03:21:14,950 --> 03:21:22,569
can I actually play as Luigi? I don't want to call him though.

1188
03:21:23,370 --> 03:21:41,129
I don't want to talk to him. somebody else call him. that very clearly was eaten and

1189
03:21:41,129 --> 03:22:22,500
puked up. where's the stone? how am I supposed to get up there? I mean that's how I'm gonna do it.

1190
03:22:23,299 --> 03:24:17,500
where's the stone? I didn't even see a stone to pick up. oh! kill them! eight seconds! you can't

1191
03:24:17,500 --> 03:24:46,250
throw... it's too heavy. I tried to throw it up like three times. the thing is really heavy.

1192
03:24:46,250 --> 03:25:16,200
twitch acting! get out of here! this is bullshit! this is bullshit! oh my god! I get called one more

1193
03:25:16,200 --> 03:25:33,139
time by Luigi. I'm gonna fucking be mad. gimme this motherfucker! get over here! kill all of

1194
03:25:33,139 --> 03:25:39,299
them! kill them all! literally kill them all! I don't want to see any of their faces ever

1195
03:25:39,299 --> 03:25:48,100
again. that's what's making this so stupid is just dodging the fucking six bones that are on

1196
03:25:48,100 --> 03:25:57,100
the screen at the same time. get out of here! all right now I can play the game. they're gonna

1197
03:25:57,100 --> 03:26:07,459
come back aren't they? I'm so like tilted right now. I guess someone called me an actor

1198
03:26:08,020 --> 03:26:41,459
because I couldn't throw a brick on top of the stove or whatever the dumb thing is. oh yeah?

1199
03:26:42,579 --> 03:27:20,100
yeah? is that what it is guys? come on man! go! I gotta get three! oh do I need more?

1200
03:27:29,610 --> 03:28:24,889
I need more than one! I'm gonna lose time again. actor! thank you for the applause! that was a pretty

1201
03:28:24,889 --> 03:28:54,649
good acting job. that was a one star quest. oh go get more stones this time. make sure you eat

1202
03:28:54,649 --> 03:29:21,899
it through the wall. I'm gonna do this one first try here. this doesn't require me to eat

1203
03:29:21,899 --> 03:30:26,100
it through the wall with Yoshi. I'm gonna get this. wall jump off this?

1204
03:30:26,579 --> 03:31:09,370
oh my god it's already fucking time to go to bed. oh shit hold on.

1205
03:31:17,879 --> 03:31:47,909
dive kick. I want those. whatever I don't have time for this. I thought that was gonna kill me

1206
03:31:47,909 --> 03:31:54,780
for a second. where's the uh bomb? there's gonna be a bomb here. oh no what can I kick?

1207
03:31:54,860 --> 03:32:05,940
what did I just do? what did I just do? what did I just do? okay hold on. I want that.

1208
03:32:08,819 --> 03:32:14,870
I want that shit. I don't think I can get it. the bomb bomb thing was gone.

1209
03:32:19,959 --> 03:32:26,340
I thought another uh bomb build thing was gonna fall. such emotional range.

1210
03:32:26,899 --> 03:33:05,530
good acting. all right one more. and the stones. I hate the stone ones.

1211
03:33:06,729 --> 03:33:28,790
the worst addition to the game so far. let me go. let me actually go up.

1212
03:33:29,750 --> 03:33:40,469
oh you got you got a combination of a stone level and a water level.

1213
03:33:41,270 --> 03:33:45,030
I may as well just punch the toe in the face like that guy wanted to like an hour ago.

1214
03:33:45,670 --> 03:34:02,040
no don't let it fall.

1215
03:34:48,139 --> 03:34:50,620
the active thing is making me laugh like over and over again.

1216
03:34:50,620 --> 03:34:58,649
I need the water to come down.

1217
03:35:15,340 --> 03:35:36,469
no up. thank you. only five? I'm so tilted about the actor joke.

1218
03:35:37,670 --> 03:35:41,030
no I'm not tilted about the actor joke. I'm tilted about the stone.

1219
03:35:43,700 --> 03:35:46,819
I couldn't do the stone and because I couldn't do the stone level

1220
03:35:47,700 --> 03:35:51,780
the fact that somebody said that I was pretending to not know how to do the stone level

1221
03:35:51,780 --> 03:36:00,540
because I didn't know how to do that. it was infuriating me because I actually didn't know.

1222
03:36:01,340 --> 03:36:26,899
calm down and have some jello. all right I got I can I can do it with the build.

1223
03:36:27,459 --> 03:36:49,989
this new area looks pretty good. that was close. oh that car almost hit me.

1224
03:36:50,629 --> 03:36:58,379
I flinched and moved. I felt that one coming in here. okay I need a thousand.

1225
03:36:58,379 --> 03:37:05,430
so that is that all the jobs that um stone toad wanted me to do?

1226
03:37:06,309 --> 03:37:15,700
so let's get some more money. is it gonna take forever? I'm already 52% of the way there.

1227
03:37:17,530 --> 03:37:22,840
it's only three and a half hours guys. what are we talking about? booze towering house of terror.

1228
03:37:27,670 --> 03:37:34,870
am I gonna play animal crossing when it comes out? maybe. that depends on if anybody wants to see it.

1229
03:37:37,079 --> 03:37:51,739
it's worth the shot. I felt the world start moving to the right so I figured maybe

1230
03:37:51,739 --> 03:38:21,290
this is a possibility. jeez. come on. come over. careful. careful. scooby doo house.

1231
03:38:25,639 --> 03:38:40,540
um sure. gonna go all the way to here. this is making my blood moldy.

1232
03:38:42,940 --> 03:38:54,260
blood mold. and why do you have blood sitting out? that's I think a better question. those ones

1233
03:38:54,260 --> 03:39:02,969
are faster. oh man. oh man. what do I do about this? I think I have to go over like this.

1234
03:39:04,010 --> 03:39:51,420
oh man. oh why did I turn? oh my god. I want a mushroom. I don't feel safe right now.

1235
03:39:51,420 --> 03:40:19,219
I need a mushroom. once the blood gets out it starts to sour. I don't. I don't. oh yeah right.

1236
03:40:19,219 --> 03:40:24,920
talking about like the blood that you were eating or something right? big showdown on

1237
03:40:24,920 --> 03:40:32,389
little star. has toad given me any four star levels? it is one. it's already done though.

1238
03:40:34,489 --> 03:40:40,889
yeah that's what I already did. big showdown on little star. if anyone receives this transmission

1239
03:40:40,889 --> 03:40:46,010
please help. bowser jr has invaded this small planet and we require assistance. the gravity is

1240
03:40:46,010 --> 03:40:51,610
odd here but you can still hold b while bouncing off of enemies to do a super jump. stomp bowser

1241
03:40:51,610 --> 03:41:28,040
into submission. oh cute song. it told me if I held b it would jump off of this and you told

1242
03:41:28,040 --> 03:41:55,270
me if I held b. I'm holding b right now. I'm holding b at the moment. right now. it's not

1243
03:41:55,270 --> 03:42:05,940
that bad. not as bad as I originally thought it was gonna be. here's the moon. can do anything?

1244
03:42:05,940 --> 03:42:22,579
the moon attacks you too? he has a smiling face. the sun is angry. moon shouldn't be like

1245
03:42:22,579 --> 03:42:44,120
this. worth a shot to see if anything in here. you guys weren't kidding when you said it gets

1246
03:42:44,120 --> 03:43:02,500
you lives. try to avoid it the whole time. okay. is that bowser jr? this is like infant bowser.

1247
03:43:03,139 --> 03:43:31,850
thanks for the key. love thud. see I want to play more levels like this. the fun cute ones.

1248
03:43:46,229 --> 03:43:53,319
boring boomer levels. well you gotta do them. you gotta make the money.

1249
03:43:54,040 --> 03:44:05,780
uh what do we need? a thousand? what about the little block down there? no I need money.

1250
03:44:06,579 --> 03:44:12,020
I'll go do the block stuff when I get enough money to build again. red yoshi's cheap cheap

1251
03:44:12,020 --> 03:44:24,649
cleanup. reach the goal after defeating at least 25 cheap cheeps. he's only in it for

1252
03:44:24,649 --> 03:44:45,420
the money. yes in mario maker 2. am I gonna do any created levels tonight? um yeah we'll

1253
03:44:45,420 --> 03:44:52,569
probably see. I'm assuming I'll get this single player stuff done in um probably in the next

1254
03:44:53,770 --> 03:45:11,879
couple hours. we'll see. we'll see how it goes. am I gonna hurt him? I missed a couple.

1255
03:45:25,059 --> 03:45:42,860
free. shit. shit. shit. oh no. oh that's fine. wait it's not fine. can I do it again?

1256
03:45:42,860 --> 03:46:23,959
I don't need yoshi anymore right? all right let's go. but yeah after the end of this

1257
03:46:24,600 --> 03:46:29,739
this will probably take us to the six to seven hour mark. I feel like I would just do mario

1258
03:46:29,739 --> 03:46:34,549
maker 2 again. I'll just do uh created levels because I feel like I don't know part of me says

1259
03:46:34,549 --> 03:46:39,430
that the multiplayer there's probably some cool stuff but it hasn't even been a day. I think

1260
03:46:39,430 --> 03:46:42,709
I'd want to give at least a few days or something for people to make cool levels.

1261
03:46:43,430 --> 03:46:55,540
all right this one's two star. hit the on off switch to get the pink coins.

1262
03:46:56,840 --> 03:47:04,219
there's been some neat stuff already. yeah we'll see how this is. I'm having a great time here.

1263
03:47:05,430 --> 03:47:12,069
this is just what I'm looking for right now. do a germa level thing. that's another thing too.

1264
03:47:12,069 --> 03:47:15,350
I mean if people wanted to make stuff I will. I'm definitely gonna play this again.

1265
03:47:15,350 --> 03:47:20,469
that's certain. so maybe people want to make some stuff they fairly felt like it.

1266
03:47:22,389 --> 03:47:31,350
all right so hold on. I'm gonna do this like puzzle. all right so there's that.

1267
03:47:32,069 --> 03:48:05,700
there's that one. and okay we could do this. two. oops. I gotta get that.

1268
03:48:06,500 --> 03:48:21,479
there's one. there's two. there's three. switch it off first.

1269
03:48:22,360 --> 03:48:43,219
it's a daisy. oops. just keep it on. what are you doing? now turn it off after it bounces.

1270
03:48:44,260 --> 03:48:52,069
I want to give you my pokemon cards. you keep your keep your pokemon cards.

1271
03:48:52,870 --> 03:49:06,520
this is gonna be worth like thousands of dollars one day. oh shit. okay hold on. I gotta time this.

1272
03:49:07,799 --> 03:49:16,040
no no no no. keep I'm gonna keep it locked in on the other one. and then now we do it.

1273
03:49:17,399 --> 03:49:37,370
not now. no. so I can get it. nice. should I break them all? or at least these ones?

1274
03:49:38,569 --> 03:49:40,889
there might be some treasure in here or something. it's possible.

1275
03:49:41,850 --> 03:49:58,979
all the ones I have to step on. like that. if it ain't broke don't fix it. I thought there

1276
03:49:58,979 --> 03:50:15,020
might be a coin thing in there. secret block. right. that's what I'm saying. if it ain't fixed

1277
03:50:15,020 --> 03:50:30,059
don't break it. blink blank blunk. I made a house for ant troopers out of blinking blocks.

1278
03:50:30,059 --> 03:50:34,139
can someone check to make sure the path is clear? I will do it. and then after this I

1279
03:50:34,139 --> 03:50:41,239
have enough money to do the other wing. I need 1100. and then we'll go back down to the block

1280
03:50:41,239 --> 03:51:07,770
guy and see what he wants to do. bye. that was instant. I'm gonna fall over here so I can just

1281
03:51:07,770 --> 03:51:24,860
kill him. like that. yeah these look. yeah the ants look super weird. they really do.

1282
03:51:26,299 --> 03:51:46,020
I gotta get as many coins as I can possibly grab with two hands. can I say ants again? ants.

1283
03:51:46,020 --> 03:51:49,379
why?

1284
03:51:57,979 --> 03:52:10,520
thought that was the end. two three.

1285
03:52:21,239 --> 03:52:48,500
you fucking idiot. oh my god. I tried to do it so fast. it's all right. I'm right here. two three.

1286
03:52:48,500 --> 03:52:57,930
what the fuck just happened to be. no.

1287
03:53:01,690 --> 03:53:50,600
okay I'm fine. that's 50. slow down. I'm just gonna fall. all right I'm good. just jump on them.

1288
03:53:52,040 --> 03:54:08,629
unnecessary. unnecessary. in between. I love in between all this.

1289
03:54:09,430 --> 03:54:22,680
somebody just writes. why this like. I don't even understand. all right.

1290
03:54:23,479 --> 03:54:34,920
uh west hall roof. might as well just finish the west hall. now I'm gonna go down to the block guy.

1291
03:54:35,719 --> 03:54:44,729
construction has started on the west hall roof. we got the construction cover. just get out of

1292
03:54:44,729 --> 03:54:50,860
here. seven new jobs. but I want to go over here because now doing these jobs will complete

1293
03:54:50,860 --> 03:55:09,079
the building. right? okay darkness ahead. darkness below. could you take a look at

1294
03:55:09,079 --> 03:55:15,340
the basement and tell us how spacious it is? maybe a dark level. do I have any thoughts

1295
03:55:15,340 --> 03:55:27,799
on gaming? no. not really. it's pretty fun. this one's gonna be hell. I remember

1296
03:55:27,799 --> 03:55:31,959
doing this one in donkey kong country and it made me break a like a nintendo 64 controller.

1297
03:55:32,840 --> 03:56:05,399
oh no. whatever it was. super nintendo. scary. actually scary. there's a lot of coins though.

1298
03:56:11,340 --> 03:56:26,440
I can't wait for people to make horror games. they're going to. oh why did I wait that

1299
03:56:26,440 --> 03:56:32,920
extra second for. I waited a half second for no reason. I don't know why I did that.

1300
03:56:33,959 --> 03:57:17,100
it hurts. glare. ding dong. did I find a secret? get me out of that one. amazon package. yeah

1301
03:57:17,500 --> 03:57:22,329
that's true. all right. after this next one I'm going to take the first break in the night.

1302
03:57:22,329 --> 03:57:26,409
I'm going to grab something to drink. go to the bathroom and I might even eat

1303
03:57:27,049 --> 03:57:37,719
a piece of turkey as quickly as I can. where are you putting this one? I put a oh a hidden block.

1304
03:57:38,600 --> 03:57:52,600
red flower. red flower. interesting. you got any more? yep. one last job and we get an

1305
03:57:52,600 --> 03:57:59,659
outfit. finally found a place that we love but it's been infested by the whomps. could you

1306
03:57:59,659 --> 03:58:21,780
please survey the damage they've done? yeah. hi top. the whomp tower. can I stand on his head?

1307
03:58:22,899 --> 03:58:36,440
I can. sometimes I don't know. cranberry sauce is fruit jello. whatever your opinion is on that

1308
03:58:37,479 --> 03:59:02,940
I respect it and that's fine. that's it. I probably could have seen that one coming but

1309
03:59:02,940 --> 03:59:34,360
I didn't. he's getting impatient. this is where it starts to derail if he does anything

1310
03:59:34,360 --> 04:00:39,450
else stupid. calm down. Jesus. oh oh same audio clip. oh oh oh oh for real. I have to get that.

1311

1312
04:01:01,000 --> 04:01:42,409
hitbox. oh I missed a secret. I don't care. the stream title is actually better than others.

1313
04:01:42,809 --> 04:01:49,420
oh it's yeah it's just you should have seen it before. I went through two or three iterations.

1314
04:01:49,420 --> 04:01:54,579
I love this shirt. what was it before I turned the stream on? it was it to me and then space

in brackets. hey greg smith. I just want to let you know if you're watching if you come across

1317
04:02:04,659 --> 04:02:17,780

1324
04:03:45,100 --> 04:03:59,909

1325
04:04:00,629 --> 04:04:10,969
should I open my eyes? I'm gonna open them. okay well I'm just like floating here. that's

1326
04:04:11,049 --> 04:04:34,760

1327
04:05:08,780 --> 04:05:24,620
okay I'm fine. can I make it? is it enough? is that's enough? no it's not. is that space

1328
04:05:24,700 --> 04:06:04,149
there? fucking just don't do that. play. thought about it. I lost all the coins that I got though.

I have to do the whole thing again. guys I don't have a switch anymore.

1333
04:10:56,219 --> 04:11:04,920
I just frisbeated out the window as hard as I could. oh the music box. never mind.

1334
04:11:07,340 --> 04:11:49,639
you guys are trapped here forever. oh come on. just whatever. oh what the hell.

1335
04:11:58,780 --> 04:12:03,659
oh my god. it's the floatiness of the water combined with the smallness of the character

1336
04:12:03,659 --> 04:12:07,340
combined with the music in the background combined with the darkness that is making

1337
04:12:07,340 --> 04:13:12,969
me have a problem. got them all didn't I? no I didn't. no I got it. okay. I'm good.

1341
04:14:10,809 --> 04:14:16,889
hold your breath. another underwater one. uh I'm determined to show my dearest my finest

1342
04:14:16,889 --> 04:14:20,250
qualities. I know she'd be impressed to see me swim across the river without once coming

1343
04:14:20,250 --> 04:14:30,680
up for air. reach the goal without getting out of the water. I'm not looking forward to this.

1344
04:14:31,399 --> 04:14:37,829
is this the way to kill mario?

1345
04:14:45,209 --> 04:14:52,200
please grab this. whatever it is. you missed. just...

1346
04:14:53,879 --> 04:14:59,299
I didn't get out. I'm still in. I was holding my head under the water.

1347
04:15:06,620 --> 04:15:15,399
get away from me. can I step on your head? yes I can. don't. fire under water? don't

1348
04:15:15,399 --> 04:15:42,659
really make much sense. I know but it is video game. I was looking over a chat.

1349
04:15:43,620 --> 04:15:46,579
someone told me to shut up so I just looked at it. I was like hey why'd that person say shut up?

1350
04:15:48,100 --> 04:16:12,459
why is everything 10 fps? shouldn't be. this one's a lot easier than the last one. I'm not

1351
04:16:12,459 --> 04:16:48,760
gonna choke. I'm good. I'm gonna choke. that took longer than winning going forward.

1352
04:16:49,799 --> 04:16:57,159
I thought it was gonna be a mushroom. I wasn't on top of his head? I wasn't on top of his

1353
04:16:57,159 --> 04:17:33,299
head. I was on his head. I don't understand that. I'm going fast. go up water. go up go up.

1354
04:17:33,299 --> 04:17:56,340
already got it. don't even need it. all right come on. do this underwater level while holding

1355
04:17:56,340 --> 04:18:10,620
your breath in real life. that's a pretty dumb idea. so I'm gonna have to say I'm gonna

1356
04:18:10,620 --> 04:18:37,100
decline that gamer funny challenge there. just shoot him. I'm still in.

1357
04:18:37,979 --> 04:19:08,100
oh oh oh I'm sorry about the mic being peaked. I really am. I'm not like this. this is the first

1358
04:19:08,100 --> 04:19:13,219
stream you've ever watched on my channel. I'm not like this. I don't like... did he just

1359
04:19:13,219 --> 04:19:31,899
get rid of the pole? how do I complete the level? I don't usually... no I don't usually

1360
04:19:31,899 --> 04:19:41,909
snore. you're right. this gg idiot. what is this? I can't even hear it anyways. never mind.

1361
04:19:42,549 --> 04:19:54,100
I think I might have the headphones plugged in. the mountains move. a groove so funky. here we go.

1362
04:19:58,420 --> 04:20:33,780
there they come. kind of ugly. got anything else? you got one more. it's gonna be a four star.

1363
04:20:34,579 --> 04:20:45,979
special close. it is a four star difficulty sea of sorrow. my dearest has dumped me and

1364
04:20:45,979 --> 04:20:56,059
so I float aimlessly adrift on a sea of sorrow wallow with me mario. that got sort of sad.

1365
04:21:03,930 --> 04:21:35,530
is this supposed to be him crying? get in the shoe. what? punch all of the ghosts in the face?

1366
04:21:40,760 --> 04:21:52,469
look at chap. he doesn't know and that's why I look over there.

1367
04:21:53,430 --> 04:22:35,379
let's continue. watch out. you're gonna crush the blocks, right? and then come down.

1368
04:22:36,180 --> 04:22:40,620
come down? do you come down?

1369
04:22:43,420 --> 04:22:45,899
guess you kind of do.

1370
04:22:49,180 --> 04:22:53,459
all the way? what's over here?

1371
04:22:56,500 --> 04:23:02,360
this is one of those freaky levels. yeah this is a freaky one.

1372
04:29:05,770 --> 04:29:25,799
what's the goal here? what's the end goal? well leave me be please. I can't believe he

1373
04:29:25,799 --> 04:29:30,280
just fucking sniped me. you gotta be kidding me. it's all right. this is it, right? okay.

1374
04:29:31,079 --> 04:29:51,030
that wasn't even really that bad but it kind of was. oh frog cap. what does this mold your

1375
04:29:51,030 --> 04:29:56,250
blood thing? I don't understand. don't mold your blood. mold mold. is this like a new

1376
04:29:56,250 --> 04:30:17,559
thing that I don't know what it is? yawn. okay seven jobs. how much is it to build?

1377
04:30:18,600 --> 04:30:32,340
okay keep up the good work. I'm gonna do main hall roof. I need 1500. I need money.

1378
04:30:33,139 --> 04:30:48,149
is there a uh there's no cost. I can't like change my costume right now.

1379
04:30:49,430 --> 04:30:56,260
all right we got three more and then we got a pretty hard one. so

1380
04:30:56,260 --> 04:31:01,719
deep in the windy valley. can you withstand the cold and make it to the bottom of the

1381
04:31:01,719 --> 04:31:13,540
valley? let's see. am I not gonna make any courses? not on stream. no. I am absolutely 100%

1382
04:31:13,540 --> 04:31:23,819
not capable of making a interesting level on this stream. no way. I'm gonna wait till the

1383
04:31:23,819 --> 04:31:44,219
wind blows this way. he doesn't believe in himself. I mean I just I just don't believe I

1384
04:31:44,219 --> 04:31:53,819
could make anything that was worth watching because I have no idea what the hell I'm doing.

1385
04:31:53,819 --> 04:31:58,520
I didn't do the I didn't really make any the first one. I'd have to relearn all the tools

1386
04:32:00,360 --> 04:32:06,950
that would be like a six hour tutorial stream. I'd rather just make the cool shit that people have

1387
04:32:07,829 --> 04:32:15,299
and enjoy the awesome creativity that the community puts forth after I beat the single

1388
04:32:15,299 --> 04:32:33,559
player because this is fucking fun and I almost got really mad. there's the key.

1389
04:32:34,600 --> 04:32:49,370
played league of legends. now that's something I can guarantee I have never heard before on

1390
04:32:49,370 --> 04:33:06,869
this channel. that's a lot of coins. I'll take it. gonna play league. sorry. unfortunately.

1391
04:33:08,389 --> 04:33:20,729
not gonna be playing league of legends on this channel. he offered you to play league. I

1392
04:33:20,729 --> 04:33:24,569
doubled. I will double it if you don't. whatever he will offer you to play league,

1393
04:33:24,569 --> 04:33:32,009
I'll double it if you don't. can I just say no? why does that have to be money involved?

1394
04:33:32,970 --> 04:33:45,459
they're getting a little harder. seesaw's ancient seesaw fortress.

1395
04:33:47,380 --> 04:34:00,439
you don't have to play lol but you have to make an obnoxious youtube ad for it.

1396
04:34:02,200 --> 04:34:15,590
does league have what the hell did I just say? oh I'm respawning. I already blew the

1397
04:34:15,590 --> 04:34:34,150
opportunity. can I just die? kill me. there are there are league of legends youtuber ads.

1398
04:34:35,349 --> 04:34:39,270
you don't actually have been seeing a lot of lately on ipad especially ipad games.

1399
04:34:39,750 --> 04:34:48,229
is pretend youtubers and fake pretend streamers. they're playing the game that they're advertising

1400
04:34:48,229 --> 04:34:53,830
on their whatever their 15 20 30 second ad is and they pretend that this is a youtuber.

1401
04:34:55,029 --> 04:35:00,650
like oh my god I can't believe it. guys so this new game that came out it's just like

1402
04:35:00,650 --> 04:35:16,459

1403
04:35:16,540 --> 04:35:19,180
they have a username and all and the person doesn't exist.

1404
04:35:23,000 --> 04:35:54,860

04:37:52,889 --> 04:38:03,560
than the ball. oh um this is gonna unearth the bombs. how long does it take for them to explode?

1411
04:38:04,119 --> 04:38:39,959
oh man don't. hey how do. it's gotta walk up this. like that. this shit's dangerous.

1416
04:41:05,799 --> 04:41:10,540
first of all I gotta knock. I gotta get his. I gotta think about this because what happens

1417
04:41:10,540 --> 04:41:36,790
if I fuck this up? oh I don't have it anymore. sometimes you gotta just hit take the damage

1418
04:41:36,790 --> 04:41:57,020
frames. damage frames are not cheating. they're a part of the game. all right let's build.

1419
04:41:57,900 --> 04:42:07,450
uh how much do I need? 12? 15. yeah I want that top roof done first. or you know what? nah.

1426
04:44:23,529 --> 04:44:30,200
hall. where are we getting close? I think I can do this in like another hour or so.

1427
04:44:31,000 --> 04:44:39,700
I don't know. I'm gonna get at least to the end of this. I'm into this. I'm having a blast. funny

1438
04:47:49,299 --> 04:48:00,500
the underground menace. I'll pay you to take care of it. 40 equals 50. I have played 50

1439
04:48:00,500 --> 04:48:07,450
something level because I did 40 in a row here on this list and then I also did the dog.

1440
04:48:07,450 --> 04:48:16,810
I also did the eraser head man. I also did the yawning guy. it's like 55 or something.

1441
04:48:17,369 --> 04:48:18,409
you don't think I know what I'm doing?

1442
04:48:21,740 --> 04:48:44,840
oh shit. I gotta outrun the snake. I like these things. this is cool.

1443
04:48:44,840 --> 04:49:31,029
fire flower? give it here. shit. I swear to god. I swear to god. I just...

1444
04:49:32,540 --> 04:49:35,180
the stick against the wall thing is just... I'm not... I just...

1445
04:49:35,180 --> 04:49:45,830
I had it but then I did go on the other side. that's a big oof.

1446
04:49:48,060 --> 04:50:11,319
this is the ASMR level. I'm gonna get that 10 points. watch.

1447
04:50:15,369 --> 04:50:17,610
damage breaks. oh my god. don't do it again, Jeremy. please.

1448
04:50:22,790 --> 04:50:30,310
the button. the stupid little tiny fucking chocolate chip buttons. I pressed them all.

1449
04:50:31,509 --> 04:51:12,500
I got a niece, right? this niece is... is that... she's six. I really do believe

1450
04:51:12,500 --> 04:51:15,700
that she would have trouble holding this and pressing buttons because her hands are too big.

1451
04:51:17,060 --> 04:51:18,180
if this guy kills me, I quit.

1452
04:51:20,180 --> 04:52:05,560
I have to... liar. I will... hold on. I'm gonna quit. that doesn't mean I'm gonna...

1453
04:52:05,560 --> 04:52:16,040
I'm gonna watch luigi beat it for this. liar.

1454
04:52:25,720 --> 04:52:50,790
all right. I quit. cigarettes. I'm not gonna smoke them anymore.

1455
04:52:53,060 --> 04:53:03,740
that's... that's what I meant. today's the day. save me, snake walk. sure.

1456
04:53:04,380 --> 04:53:11,340
need to find novel ways to use the snake block. this is gonna be fun.

1457
04:53:18,259 --> 04:53:29,750
do you actually smoke? no. like, you just... no. no. because, you know, obviously no. I don't.

1458
04:53:29,750 --> 04:53:37,909
I do not. you know, if it were me playing the game right now,

1459
04:53:38,869 --> 04:53:47,220
I would have jumped and freaked out like five times. sometimes. you just have a confidence

1460
04:53:47,220 --> 04:53:58,869
boost here that you can do anything. for instance, I can do anything. I can do anything.

1461
04:54:02,310 --> 04:54:20,979
I don't even need to look. I wasn't aware you could get crushed on the top of the screen.

1462
04:54:20,979 --> 04:55:04,150
I didn't know the screen had a sky block. and why did it kill me? the screen goes up.

1463
04:55:04,150 --> 04:55:11,770
what? one of these mario video game historians tell me why that happened.

1464
04:55:12,729 --> 04:55:26,939
that's going too fast. gotta keep up. come on. I'm moving fast as the screen is going.

1465
04:55:27,740 --> 04:56:10,330
oh, shit. do more. 63%. almost do the other side. with a land of the dark level. pitch black

1466
04:56:10,330 --> 04:56:26,200
underground. this one's gonna be a blast. change the outfit. the outfit is only for my me,

1467
04:56:26,200 --> 04:56:44,279
isn't it? because I don't want to lose my weight. what? I? okay. I thought I could jump on it.

1468
04:57:01,240 --> 04:57:12,740
does it keep going? you just beat the light. you go forward. how do I not get any of this?

1469
04:57:17,819 --> 04:57:24,259
I don't know. well, was something else supposed to get? oh, my god.

1470
04:57:59,220 --> 04:58:39,080
thanks for the help, Luigi. do I run out of these or something? how do I delete them?

1471
04:58:39,639 --> 04:58:58,419
can I delete them? I hate this. I'm just gonna take it slow.

1472
04:59:02,900 --> 04:59:11,900
the p is just the light. it's no other purpose. what the fuck?

1473
04:59:13,580 --> 04:59:38,409
I just gotta let it go forward. I'm leaning back in my chair. that's bad. I gotta get up.

1474
04:59:52,200 --> 05:00:13,259
okay. follow the p and prepare for that shit. how do I get those?

1475
05:00:14,220 --> 05:00:22,310
I'm missing so many cool secrets. was it 50? is it 50? can you tell? is it 50?

1476
05:00:23,750 --> 05:00:40,060
30. can I stand on those? holy fuck. I was looking. you've gotta be fucking kidding me.

1477
05:00:40,060 --> 05:00:53,500
I thought I... I am so dumb. I was looking at chat. I thought it was gonna just take me

1478
05:00:53,500 --> 05:01:33,849
like the whole way around. can I get that 50? I can ride that POW. where's the rest of that?

1479
05:01:33,849 --> 05:01:58,259
I need the POW to be over here. I think I have to jump. holy shit. be careful. it's up.

1480
05:01:59,459 --> 05:02:09,930
okay. what did that do? anything for me? not really. what if I hit the POW? will that get

1481
05:02:09,930 --> 05:02:45,380
the coin? I made it. I didn't get the 30 coins, though. one more. it fell down. oh, shit.

1482
05:02:46,259 --> 05:03:02,009
bouncing through the clouds. reach the goal after grabbing at least 40 coins.

1483
05:03:02,650 --> 05:03:18,599
and there's a bunch of bullet bills. gotta get 40. there's no time.

1484
05:03:20,040 --> 05:03:37,110
with the quickness. with the swiftness there. maybe you guys said bullet hell.

1485
05:03:37,110 --> 05:04:02,470
and there it is. and there it is. and see what. I just gotta pay attention to where the

1486
05:04:02,470 --> 05:04:12,040
bullets are. and not that else. I have plenty of time. holy shit. I'm just gonna kill them.

1487
05:04:12,759 --> 05:04:41,099
now. that's it. with 65 seconds to spare. very cool. how long do switch controllers last?

1488
05:04:44,459 --> 05:04:50,220
outside the dock at full charge. more than like seven or eight hours? or is it less than that?

1489
05:04:50,939 --> 05:05:06,569
there's the top of the castle. it's done. now we gotta finish the right side.

1490
05:05:08,889 --> 05:05:14,889
avant-garde style of the interior parapets. it looks amazing. keep up the good work.

1491
05:05:15,849 --> 05:05:25,939
east hall. second floor. build it. congrats on the main hall. roof germa. thank you.

1492
05:05:27,799 --> 05:05:49,180
thanks. that means a lot. thank you. how many. all right. did I do all the jobs back here?

1493
05:05:49,819 --> 05:06:05,110
the first five. all right. the first five pages are completely done. all right. we got

1494
05:06:05,110 --> 05:06:12,409
bumper jump around. bumper jump around. I added some bumpers to my athletic course.

1495
05:06:15,220 --> 05:06:24,090
change outfit. I will. after this level, I'm gonna change my outfit. we'll see what it looks

1496
05:06:24,090 --> 05:06:43,139
like. all this shit saves, right? well, now I gotta use gamer skill or else I'm not gonna make it.

1497
05:06:43,139 --> 05:07:59,610
that's what I need. pick me up. pick me up. I avoided everything else. this time I actually

1498
05:07:59,610 --> 05:08:22,709
have the hat on. get all the coins. good job. don't blow it again.

1499
05:08:23,349 --> 05:08:56,040
what am I doing? hurry up and get it. such a stressful game. it just is. flag was right here.

1500
05:08:57,240 --> 05:09:12,409
this should be relaxing. you know, it's weird because it's 50% relaxing. 50% build the castle.

1501
05:09:13,610 --> 05:09:18,380
I just want to build it. I kind of don't care about anything else.

1502
05:09:19,020 --> 05:09:30,229
platforms really are stressful. change my mind. I don't think I have to change your mind.

1503
05:09:30,229 --> 05:09:35,299
I think I probably agree with you. we've got a couple of relaxing ones ahead of us though.

1504
05:09:35,299 --> 05:09:39,770
master the trees. we just have to climb some trees. reach the goal if you're doing a hand

1505
05:09:39,770 --> 05:09:46,009
stand on all the trees. this is a one star. what time is the movie night tomorrow? same time

1506
05:09:46,009 --> 05:09:53,220
as the regular spring. by the way, if you have not gotten a submission in and you want to,

1507
05:09:54,279 --> 05:09:59,240
make sure you get it in by tonight because if you get it in by tomorrow morning, afternoon,

1508
05:09:59,240 --> 05:10:08,340
pacific, it's gonna be hard to add you to the list. oh, I forgot to change the outfit. I'll do

1509
05:10:08,340 --> 05:10:16,790
it after this. never mind. I guess we'll do it now. and remember that this tomorrow is not a

1510
05:10:16,790 --> 05:10:23,099
contest. we're just picking some of the, I guess we're gonna, there's like a, essentially

1511
05:10:23,099 --> 05:10:51,020
a net to try to catch some of the higher quality submissions. ready to submit? there's

1512
05:10:51,020 --> 05:11:10,069
a google form. only submit one video. we can get the google form link if somebody has it.

1513
05:11:10,069 --> 05:11:19,590
and it has to include video footage from the green screen. you can't just, you can't just

1514
05:11:19,590 --> 05:11:25,189
submit. I'm not gonna say it because somebody will. so just make sure it's green screen.

1515
05:11:26,150 --> 05:11:39,259
okay, hold on. were you running through this?

1516
05:11:42,540 --> 05:11:50,169
what am i talking about? so six months ago or so, we did a green screen movie night where i

1517
05:11:50,169 --> 05:11:54,169
went in front of the green screen and recorded like six or seven hours with the stuff.

1518
05:11:54,889 --> 05:11:59,130
and then the community came together and made a bunch of random stuff that was the green screen

1519
05:11:59,130 --> 05:12:03,209
movie night. there were hundreds and hundreds of videos that we watched.

1520
05:12:03,689 --> 05:12:12,380
and people thought it was a lot of fun, so for the longest time, i wanted to do another one, which is

1521
05:12:13,259 --> 05:12:24,650
not as long as the first one. that's what tomorrow night is. that dive kick is freaking me out.

1522
05:12:24,650 --> 05:12:58,060
climb up. done. am i gonna get bounced around here until i die? oh my god. jeremy, turn up my

1523
05:12:58,139 --> 05:13:27,220
jeremy. turn up my mic. what's wrong with my mic? it looks fine over here. on my end, it looks like

1524
05:13:27,220 --> 05:13:32,580
everything's fine. i don't know. that's weird. maybe when i got really loud it just fucked up.

1525
05:13:38,459 --> 05:13:43,220
all right, outfit. yeah, no, no, no. outfit, outfit, outfit, outfit. it's hard to hear me.

1526
05:13:43,860 --> 05:13:50,389
i swear to god, there's some weird thing how this pulls in through obs and pushes out.

1527
05:13:51,110 --> 05:14:02,330
because over on my obs, it looks like i'm about to peek every single sentence i say. it's strange.

1528
05:14:02,330 --> 05:14:09,779
i'm at like just about like minus eight db, or minus like five, like into the red. so i don't

1529
05:14:09,779 --> 05:14:18,700
know. that's weird. i get that a lot though. it's definitely not just one person. so don't

1530
05:14:18,700 --> 05:14:25,430
ask me why it's like that. i'll dial myself up a little bit here. all right, so what do

1531
05:14:25,430 --> 05:14:31,580
i go to do this stuff? back to the title, notification settings, play guide, back to title.

1532
05:14:31,580 --> 05:14:56,650
like where would i do this? watch me lose all that progress. okay, play, right? course world.

1533
05:14:57,450 --> 05:15:08,729
my stream's always relatively quiet. i wonder why. there i am doing the charlie brown dance.

1534
05:15:10,580 --> 05:15:21,240
change outfit. i got some new hats. where are they? where are they? i got another one,

1535
05:15:21,240 --> 05:15:33,509
didn't i? oh, it's weirdly spaced. oh, i have an animated hoodie. is that for pre-ordering the

1536
05:15:33,509 --> 05:15:49,209
game or something? i like this one. and then what's the full suit? oh, it's the dress.

1537
05:15:49,209 --> 05:16:10,389
okay, i like the cookie monster though. there we go. hyped. that's how i'm always just so

1538
05:16:10,389 --> 05:16:20,979
hyped, right? that's usually what? change face? no. all right, i'm not ready for this yet.

1539
05:16:20,979 --> 05:16:44,299
i want to... i'm still building the house. upside down stretches. i think my life would be better

1540
05:16:44,299 --> 05:16:53,529
if i didn't watch germa. well, i... that's a... i mean, that's like a... that's a... that's a you

1541
05:16:53,529 --> 05:16:59,340
thing. i... i don't know how to tell you about... and i just jumped off the edge because

1542
05:16:59,340 --> 05:17:08,540
i'm just trying to... i'm reading. i'd probably get more shit done, to be honest.

1543
05:17:10,659 --> 05:17:17,590
don't go anywhere. don't go anywhere just yet. hold on a second here. what about those

1544
05:17:17,590 --> 05:17:21,799
funny tuber moments? what if you... what if you missed the... all right, i'm done. not with the

1545
05:17:21,799 --> 05:17:25,000
game, but just like with what i was just doing. no, i'm not. i'm gonna keep going. what about those

1546
05:17:25,000 --> 05:17:35,669
funny tuber moments? but you might miss those if you didn't hang out. why hasn't luigi decided

1547
05:17:35,669 --> 05:18:06,970
to help me in a long time? he blocked him. no, he blocked me. why did i just... how do i rate

1548
05:18:06,970 --> 05:18:16,840
this level? i want to give it a one star. he's doing his own shit and living his own life.

1549
05:18:17,400 --> 05:18:47,639
all right, any buttons to press? no. don't kill me. they worked hard on this. how could you say that?

1550
05:18:48,439 --> 05:18:52,340
yeah, i worked hard on my birdhouse there and people told me that i was stupid and it sucked.

1551
05:18:52,979 --> 05:18:57,060
are we gonna... will we have a couple of different standards here? is that

1552
05:18:57,060 --> 05:19:20,500
understood? careful. careful here. careful. careful. i can't go up there. how am i gonna

1553
05:19:20,500 --> 05:19:37,380
get away from that? all right, i'm good. watch out. there's the one dude there is just kind

1554
05:19:37,380 --> 05:19:43,380
of hanging out. this is messing up my head here. this is screwing up my brain. i have to get rid

1555
05:19:43,380 --> 05:20:07,209
of that thing. there we go. all right, i got through that. get rid of this snot ghost. almost

1556
05:20:07,209 --> 05:20:19,060
there. cock strikes again. yeah, unfortunately they tend to do that. i have to get a running

1557
05:20:19,060 --> 05:20:39,529
start. be careful. okay, hold on. how can i get that? this is bad. this is gonna be bad,

1558
05:20:39,529 --> 05:21:07,700
right? can i fall and then go to the right? i mean, yeah, i need the left. no flag either.

1559
05:21:07,700 --> 05:21:15,459
that was... that was close. you're right. that was a close one. get all the coins.

1560
05:21:19,880 --> 05:21:28,819
oh, shit. no, that's... that's not okay. that's not good. i can do the whole thing again.

1561
05:21:34,060 --> 05:21:37,580
no, i had... i did have a flag. i did. why does it feel so far away?

1562
05:21:47,130 --> 05:21:57,240
no, that's not okay. did i die in mario maker or did i like rear end somebody

1563
05:21:57,319 --> 05:22:19,770
in traffic? oh, no, that's not okay. that's not okay. oh, no. all right, i gotta get this again.

1564
05:22:34,169 --> 05:22:40,060
all right, luigi is adamant on giving me parts here for some reason. he's like,

1565
05:22:40,060 --> 05:22:52,889
are you sure you don't want these? are you sure? you're probably gonna need them.

1566
05:22:53,450 --> 05:23:11,369
just jump over everybody. all right, so can i just flip it upside down again?

1567
05:23:12,090 --> 05:23:32,599
or right side up, should i say? oh, oh well. is the audio delayed again? i don't know what

1568
05:23:32,599 --> 05:23:45,110
is with this thing. why is everybody doing minus two? i didn't... i just... i didn't do anything.

1569
05:23:45,110 --> 05:24:05,990
all right, ready? two. one. i don't know. i didn't see... people are abusing that now.

1570
05:24:05,990 --> 05:24:28,580
i'm seeing some abuse on that system. you said right side up. yeah, but i just had a slip.

1571
05:24:28,580 --> 05:24:36,169
i just... i wasn't... i just... whatever. i don't even... it's not explaining. i'm dead. i'm

1572
05:24:36,169 --> 05:24:57,220
dead. i'm dead. i'm gonna die. i'm gonna die. i'm dead. all right, float me over there. you gotta

1573
05:24:57,220 --> 05:25:09,369
watch out for when the little things pop. pop. it's over the coins. what does this do for me?

1574
05:25:09,369 --> 05:25:16,840
nothing. um, do i need to go in that? oh, look at... did you see that hitbox? i did and it was

1575
05:25:16,840 --> 05:25:25,740
bad. i couldn't even believe it. why is this... oh, he's like, we're gonna back problem now.

1576
05:25:26,779 --> 05:25:31,819
there are too many people standing on this and i... i'm too panicky to get rid of them all.

1577
05:25:32,520 --> 05:25:50,650
now they... it's like just rolling the dice. nobody can do that. nobody can effectively do that.

1578
05:25:51,290 --> 05:25:54,569
if you do something like that, you jump on a shell that's in that small quarters,

1579
05:25:55,130 --> 05:26:32,779
just throw dice in the air. oh. oh. oh. what? oh, it's blocked. this one's kind of hard.

1580
05:26:34,490 --> 05:26:36,569
i would just stand in the middle, but you can't really do that either.

1581
05:26:49,349 --> 05:27:03,139
greed. tilt it up? oh, shit. no, it's gonna be down. not that far down.

1582
05:27:12,380 --> 05:27:15,900
i've been streaming this for like five and a half hours. i haven't even asked the question yet.

1583
05:27:16,779 --> 05:27:24,139
so are these levels levels that were made by nintendo teams? or were they brought over

1584
05:27:24,139 --> 05:27:28,220
from the first game? or are these just, hey, check a look at what you can do and what you're

1585
05:27:28,220 --> 05:27:46,119
capable of? and they got on. made by nintendo. showing some of the new features and stuff.

1586
05:27:46,119 --> 05:27:50,599
that's cool. half of these mechanics were not even in mario maker 1. that makes sense.

1587
05:28:06,950 --> 05:28:16,229
cool. what's left to build? you know what i mean? how much left of the castle is there to do?

1588
05:28:21,290 --> 05:28:25,619
new building options. what is now? okay, east hall cannon, east hall doors,

1589
05:28:26,419 --> 05:28:44,729
and what? the red carpet? watch it turn around and you only do the front side of the castle.

1590
05:28:45,290 --> 05:28:50,900
it's just cut in half and i have to do the back. let's do another job.

1591
05:28:54,700 --> 05:28:58,619
ant trooper march. then i've done these somehow already, a bunch of them.

1592
05:28:59,259 --> 05:29:04,939
let's clean up ant trooper march. hope you like to use why.

1593
05:29:05,959 --> 05:29:26,889
good luck. why? let's run. or dash. good music, boys and girls. no, never mind.

1594
05:29:26,889 --> 05:29:43,209
holy fuck, this is fast. that's really fast. they ramped that up real quick. it starts off

1595
05:29:43,209 --> 05:30:01,669
like this and then they just drag the screen over. get out of here, luigi. i'm gonna let

1596
05:30:01,669 --> 05:30:13,099
luigi do the last level. just get in. i don't, i have to get over this. kind of not fair.

1597
05:30:13,099 --> 05:30:51,990
he's holding down. oh shit. it's too fast. oh. mario, i wish you wouldn't just grab onto ledges

1598
05:30:58,630 --> 05:31:07,979
like that. stop grabbing onto ledges and hit the... he just bounced twice on his butt.

1599
05:31:08,860 --> 05:31:22,979
he didn't even slide. he bounced. i died in the glass. you should be safe in the glass.

1600
05:31:22,979 --> 05:31:51,930
he should be able to die in the glass. i even followed their instructions, too. what's after

1601
05:31:51,930 --> 05:32:29,720
that? perfect. sweet. that was really short. a lot of money for not a lot of time. 75. almost

1602
05:32:29,720 --> 05:32:39,110
there. the castle is almost done. we're so close. fly-by-night clown car. it's not

1603
05:32:39,110 --> 05:32:53,209
one of those fly-around-and-shoot-things levels. all right, gotta kill bowser. should be easy

1604
05:32:53,209 --> 05:33:06,599
enough. i blew it. oh, i want to restart. just do that again. uh, best song. again.

1605
05:33:15,900 --> 05:33:37,299
one bowser's. triple shot. all right, let me get a good pace here. talk... i should have gotten hit

1606
05:33:37,299 --> 05:33:56,520
there. it's a miraculous way i did not receive damage. already time to go. you have to play

1607
05:33:56,520 --> 05:34:29,700
the panic music on me. what is that? he's dead? one bowser's. i'm just playing cuphead. speaking

1608
05:34:29,700 --> 05:34:35,740
of cuphead, when does the new cuphead stuff come out? this dlc that's primed. soon here,

1609
05:34:35,740 --> 05:35:00,919
right? is there gonna be one real answer in this? i guess not. the doors and the cannon.

1610
05:35:01,560 --> 05:35:08,419
and that's all there is left. you know, there's probably like a cherry you put on top or like

1611
05:35:08,419 --> 05:35:21,819
a whip cream or something. no date set? just sometime in 2019. cool. i will be into that.

1612
05:35:23,049 --> 05:35:27,340
lava rising three stars. 200 bucks. don't even need to read the description because i know

1613
05:35:27,340 --> 05:35:44,919
what it is. there's just some finesse work to do after this. yeah, i want to try the

1614
05:35:44,919 --> 05:35:55,080
multiplayer too. once it's not day one, i would put some time into this. the reason why i wanted

1615
05:35:55,080 --> 05:35:58,919
to do the single player first is because last time i jumped right into expert levels

1616
05:35:58,919 --> 05:36:08,979
and i wanted to quit the game forever. and i did. that's close. i'd like to get back into

1617
05:36:08,979 --> 05:36:13,060
the groove of playing a mario game before i do the hardest levels i can possibly imagine.

1618
05:36:13,939 --> 05:36:26,180
well that's ways more. what should i do? oh my god, the lava comes up. right. shoot shoot

1619
05:36:27,139 --> 05:36:46,939
what's that? someone link the i quit clip from a... i did not think that was gonna go that fast.

1620
05:37:00,630 --> 05:37:14,650
was there an actual i quit moment? no, that's real. hold on. no no no no. i'm

1621
05:37:14,650 --> 05:37:40,819
talking about from like two years ago. dude, this is the wall. here comes the wall.

1622
05:37:41,540 --> 05:37:46,020
this is the wall. i'm at like 77 percent where i made it to the uh to the gear check.

1623
05:38:02,490 --> 05:38:18,580
holy fuck. does it go down? don't leave me behind here. oh my god. oh no i was on it.

1624
05:38:22,180 --> 05:38:39,240
no i have to do the whole fucking thing again. it's just a line on the screen. it's a loading

1625
05:38:39,240 --> 05:38:51,610
screen. you're not even gonna have luigi actually do something? they just let you win.

1626
05:38:52,169 --> 05:39:07,619
there's nothing else. and it's an actual just full-on win. uh okay. well oh but they get

1627
05:39:07,619 --> 05:39:12,869
they look what they do to you though. they put a luigi flag on it just to remind you forever.

1628
05:39:13,590 --> 05:39:21,830
i'll go back and do it as mario. the wops and chain chomps and passable castle

1629
05:39:23,939 --> 05:39:43,139
pick up buzzy shells with y and wear them. but that ain't gonna happen. i've got like

1630
05:39:43,139 --> 05:39:46,819
a lot of gas in my like upper gi track. it won't come out. i want to burp but i

1631
05:39:46,819 --> 05:39:51,909
feel like if i burp too hard, if i try i'll throw up. you know what i'm saying? you guys

1632
05:39:51,909 --> 05:40:12,220
have been there before? too much information? i did i gave i gave you barely any information

1633
05:40:12,220 --> 05:40:30,090
there actually. that could have been way more explicit. how do i get you up there?

1634
05:40:30,090 --> 05:40:54,900
you don't come up here? oh god just do it! just do it! just go! just do it! i know. i

1635
05:40:54,900 --> 05:41:09,430
don't know if i should have done that. i definitely should not have done that. but

1636
05:41:09,430 --> 05:41:19,479
get the flag. forget about the coins. they're not important.

1637
05:41:24,540 --> 05:41:33,930
hmm i could bump it up but i can't. i don't have the helmet anymore.

1638
05:41:41,939 --> 05:42:07,580
y. that's fantastic. ends all the way over there. great. give it to me. come on back.

1639
05:42:07,580 --> 05:42:17,209
big enough to get it. so i think i have to kill bowser with the guy's face. this is

1640
05:42:17,209 --> 05:42:44,979
gonna be annoying. you can't go through here, can you? i can still hear him. got him.

1641
05:42:51,779 --> 05:42:57,349
easier than i thought. i thought i had to get him hit by the the whomps. but apparently

1642
05:42:57,349 --> 05:43:07,349
not. just had to hit the axe. six fifty six sixty fifth. six six feet. i can't even talk.

1643
05:43:07,349 --> 05:43:24,220
83. any more jobs? so what happens when we finish this? i still have like 20 levels left to do.

1644
05:43:25,340 --> 05:43:33,639
lava bubble limbo. create an ocean of lava bubbles but now i can't get through it.

1645
05:43:33,639 --> 05:43:50,200
get through i'll pay you. i don't remember peaches castle having artillery. there's a

1646
05:43:50,200 --> 05:44:04,330
new thing? there's a new development? so what's the deal here? i just have to

1647
05:44:05,779 --> 05:44:10,459
swim with this? just get through it. but get through what?

1648
05:44:11,259 --> 05:44:43,509
fire flower. nice. i just have to swim with them. okay well. easy enough. that fish was freaking me

1649
05:44:43,509 --> 05:44:54,729
out. all right so i made it. now that they get bigger i get it. they just make it more annoying

1650
05:44:54,729 --> 05:45:02,680
to have to weed through. i really should be more in front. i was dilly dallying too much.

1651
05:45:03,639 --> 05:45:40,299
not gonna be good. double bounce. that was good. wasn't that bad. it was pretty easy. help. i can't

1652
05:45:40,299 --> 05:45:49,189
hold my breath anymore. we'll stop doing that. you don't have to do that to impress me. you

1653
05:45:49,189 --> 05:45:56,150
don't have to do that. let it go. i was still building the castle. we are. i think we're done.

1654
05:45:56,790 --> 05:46:01,209
i think there's just finishing touches because we're. what else is there to build?

1655
05:46:01,849 --> 05:46:08,650
you got something else for me? all right we're making great progress. i need a new word to

1656
05:46:08,650 --> 05:46:13,529
describe how great this new section is. how about splendorificana zarivalis.

1657
05:46:14,330 --> 05:46:23,270
we have a new building option. oh the roof. the roof of the east hall. okay. all right.

1658
05:46:25,930 --> 05:46:34,470
okay that's fine. dry bones lava lurker. reach the goal after defeating all the dry bones.

1659
05:46:44,090 --> 05:46:52,259
i'll hold my breath for. let's see. is it water in this one? well there's lava.

1660
05:46:56,139 --> 05:46:59,180
they're collecting taxes from the residents of mushroom kingdom.

1661
05:46:59,819 --> 05:47:06,459
that doesn't sound nice. why would i collect taxes from them? it's not like king mario

1662
05:47:06,459 --> 05:47:18,150
and like queen. all right. you know what? who's the queen? there is no king and queen. why is

1663
05:47:18,150 --> 05:47:46,700
there a princess? and is there a prince? does it drop? don't get it yet. i don't know.

1664
05:47:47,259 --> 05:47:58,250
the mushroom kingdom is a principality. bowser is the king. bowser is not the king.

1665
05:48:05,430 --> 05:48:11,849
who are all the toads? are they like are they supposed to be you know servants of the castle?

1666
05:48:11,849 --> 05:48:37,319
butlers? and but where is the king and queen? there isn't one. whose goddamn castle is this?

1667
05:48:41,720 --> 05:49:02,150
princess toadstool. but who was before princess toadstool? blinking block blitz. two stars.

1668
05:49:18,150 --> 05:49:22,950
there's a plumber in a non-toileted society and you're upset about the missing

1669
05:49:23,029 --> 05:49:38,459
monarchy. there's definitely toilets. there's definitely toilets. we're about to install them.

1670
05:49:38,459 --> 05:50:22,680
i hate cat mario. i don't like it at all. where's dog mario? i'm already losing time.

1675
05:51:52,580 --> 05:51:53,380
where's the flag?

05:52:10,380 --> 05:52:27,020

05:52:27,020 --> 05:52:52,840

no mistakes. no mistakes. here we go. i'm gonna do it first try. i'm gonna get everything

1686
05:55:19,419 --> 05:55:30,250
perfect. every coin go. since when do mushrooms go to the left side? it's never happened.

1687
05:55:30,810 --> 05:56:00,759
there's too many. why are they going to the left?

1688
05:56:12,819 --> 05:56:44,389
i was on it. i missed the coins. who cares. do joe rogan rant about oh oh okay mushrooms.

1691
05:57:08,409 --> 05:57:14,060
i'm gonna calm down now and i'm gonna just relax and we're just gonna play. all right.

1692
05:57:29,590 --> 05:58:19,500
it's not working. where did this come from? where did that come from? why is a mushroom in one?

1703
06:00:59,979 --> 06:01:10,020
light to make. get over it. wall jumps are great. get over it. if you mess up you'll fall into a

1704
06:01:10,020 --> 06:01:22,919
lake of boiling poison. this haha i suck at a kids game joke isn't funny. mario's no joke.

1705
06:01:25,130 --> 06:01:42,900
mario does not mess around. these games are made with skill in mind. um okay. i have just

1706
06:01:42,900 --> 06:01:59,159
barely saved my life. i'm gonna wait until the last second. into the claw. oh my god. okay.

1707
06:01:59,319 --> 06:02:26,229
not in the poison. easy. where the hell is this? they did say wall jumping. so that's what you

1708
06:02:26,229 --> 06:02:31,930
have to do. i am not going to go on the other side of that. 30 coins. someone else will get

1709
06:02:31,930 --> 06:02:36,569
them. when you load up your copy you can just you can go on the other side and get that.

1710
06:02:36,569 --> 06:03:08,979
what is going on? does it go back up? shit. all right. that was tricky but not that bad.

1711
06:03:09,700 --> 06:03:21,590
not that bad. i'm still gonna have money. what's the point of money after you build

1712
06:03:22,549 --> 06:03:28,040
everything? because i think that's it. unless there's some other random stuff that is

1713
06:03:28,040 --> 06:03:39,029
possible. i don't know what to do with the money. 91. oh everyone's stressed. that means

1714
06:03:39,029 --> 06:03:46,069
that something's wrong. oh man. oh this is bad. big red. we got a problem. i shouldn't say this

1715
06:03:46,069 --> 06:03:54,229
out loud. so here. oh total eclipse. i can't believe it. every last member of the crew

1720
06:04:54,740 --> 06:05:03,880
trapped there. he was supposed to be a hero. he died fucking instantly. he didn't even know

1721
06:05:03,880 --> 06:05:30,330
he died. it was horrible. it just seared his head off. up here. all right. this time don't

06:05:41,159 --> 06:05:46,279
hell is happening in my brain? it's like the my brain is moving faster than things on the

1724
06:05:46,599 --> 06:06:29,110
screen. it'd be nice if i got one of these. am i tall? i'm gonna like crush my head.

1725
06:06:33,770 --> 06:06:52,060
okay now just walk across them slowly. thank you. toad number two. that leaves us with bottom

1726
06:06:52,060 --> 06:07:00,229
left and top left. and then i got them all. what is this gonna do? rush twice.

1727
06:07:00,869 --> 06:07:17,209
thank you for that. appreciate it. who died? be faster next time. this doesn't hit us, right?

1729
06:08:03,049 --> 06:08:06,569
i try to do a gotcha moment there where i jump up and it instantly turns back on.

1730
06:08:07,529 --> 06:08:35,049

1732
06:08:43,860 --> 06:08:53,689
over this. did i not go this way? oh all the way to the right here. oh here you go.

1733
06:08:53,689 --> 06:09:15,110
i just don't want anybody to get hurt. someone's gonna get just clubbed by one of those 30.

1734
06:09:15,830 --> 06:09:39,349
that's a lot of coins. all right. slow. this is like a seven minute level. i don't want to

1735
06:09:39,430 --> 06:09:50,310
blow it. there's a boss at the end of this. that was way easier than i thought. i just

1736
06:09:50,310 --> 06:10:14,299
dropped them all in there. put on a face cam? all right fine. there. all right. don't worry.

1737
06:10:14,299 --> 06:10:34,220
good to see you. let me move this down. good. old joke. oh it's because of this. hold on.

1738
06:10:35,540 --> 06:10:50,150
i don't care. i don't want to do it. they're all back. you rescued the toads. you did it.

1739
06:10:50,790 --> 06:11:02,490
congratulations. now paint it. my crew finally came back. was there a lazy toad convention in

1740
06:11:02,490 --> 06:11:11,580
the bathroom or something? confirmed bathrooms. the person that said that earlier. mario's a

1741
06:11:11,580 --> 06:11:24,099
plumber. everything's done. we have new building options now. stained glass 2000. all right. so

1742
06:11:24,099 --> 06:11:39,209
it is the stained glass. that's the finishing touch. a bathroom without a toilet? would it

1743
06:11:39,209 --> 06:11:51,990
be a bathroom? i mean i guess if it had bathtubs in it. this is expensive bullshit that requires

1744
06:11:51,990 --> 06:12:16,069
completing everything. well i'm pretty close. really. just the darkness is killing me. i just

1745
06:12:17,029 --> 06:12:22,069
landed them. holy shit. something just dropped. oh man. all right. all right. slow down.

1746
06:12:22,869 --> 06:12:43,979
i thought we were going to keep going right. this is why i skipped this one.

1747
06:12:44,619 --> 06:13:05,080
he sees 10 coins and immediately beefs it. what was it immediately? i mean to be fair

1748
06:13:05,080 --> 06:13:18,200
it is a pretty prize because you need the currency. coming back. i didn't try to get it.

1749
06:13:18,200 --> 06:13:43,459
is that gonna come down? holy shit it is. i could have jumped and got it. how the hell. i hear

1750
06:13:43,459 --> 06:13:59,319
something. what do i hear? i hear something. oh my god. it's saws. 50. oh i want it so bad.

1751
06:14:00,439 --> 06:14:21,319
nope. luigi can have that 50. yeah. i missed a 50. it hurts to miss a 50. it does.

1752
06:14:21,959 --> 06:14:31,979
unfortunately. angry angry sun. cloudy with a chance of gamma ray burst. i recommend using

1753
06:14:31,979 --> 06:14:38,729
the cloud cover to avoid getting a nasty sun burn. can you do face cam? sure i'll do it for

1754
06:14:38,729 --> 06:15:02,599
a second. i'm not fixing the audio because like it's gonna take too long. wait for the wait

1755
06:15:02,599 --> 06:15:40,900
wait wait. all right. hold on. that's better. hi. if i had just paid attention to the game.

1756
06:16:22,939 --> 06:16:51,110
oh a hamster. i don't do cam man. i don't do cam. i don't do cam dude. sorry. all right. i'm

1757
06:16:51,110 --> 06:17:04,950
it's fucking my brain. this is this level's. just watch the sun. give it to me please. all

1758
06:17:04,950 --> 06:17:12,619
right. relax. bring it back. i want. why am i reading chat and walking off of a fucking cliff

1759
06:17:12,619 --> 06:17:21,610
at the same time? what would the purpose of that be? get out of here you fucking banjo

1760
06:17:21,610 --> 06:17:39,909
kazooie looking dick. that was uncalled for. yeah but where has he been? all right. where has

1761
06:17:39,909 --> 06:17:57,189
he been for 20 years? he walked out and didn't come back. holy shit. i can still do it. greed

1762
06:17:57,189 --> 06:18:03,779
is killing me here. greed is killing me. it killed me. all right face cam on for this one.

1763
06:18:03,779 --> 06:18:42,119
watch out for the sun. watch out for the sun. i'm thinking about getting the coins.

1764
06:18:48,540 --> 06:19:23,990
oh shit. where's this going? the sun's just being annoying now. get up there. fuck did i go?

1765
06:19:23,990 --> 06:19:33,689
oh. i'm trying to jump to get the coins. words first. marticle. marticle. vertical mario mvp.

1766
06:19:46,490 --> 06:20:06,139
all right. get out of here. how much is left? there are a shitload of levels left. what happens

1767
06:20:06,139 --> 06:20:19,770
when we build the castle? reach the goal in the koopa troopa car. do a multiplayer before

1768
06:20:19,770 --> 06:20:23,529
it's too late. well it's not going to be too late because we're going to do it again.

1769
06:20:24,169 --> 06:20:46,569
it's actually a car. how do i drive it? holy. this is awesome. imagine the levels

1770
06:20:47,209 --> 06:20:56,259
that we'll get out of this. somebody will recreate the whole track. i love this level.

1771
06:20:56,259 --> 06:20:59,700
this is one of those levels in the original that just played itself and it was like

1772
06:20:59,700 --> 06:21:05,939
impossible to lose. you just had to drive and left the show. remember the songs? these are the

1773
06:21:05,939 --> 06:21:22,299
best. hey. you can go up or down. right on top. yeah that's a full letter grade up. you're

1774
06:21:22,299 --> 06:21:33,159
right. if this was like a b minus so far. like a b. it's now an a. although i don't know if i

1775
06:21:33,159 --> 06:21:47,159
would classify this as a b minus. it's just fun. buzzy the movie the book of the ride.

1776
06:21:52,150 --> 06:21:56,950
reach the goal to grabbing 80 coins. click coins while trying not to fall to your doom.

1777
06:21:56,950 --> 06:22:13,830
once you grab buzzy beetle's shell you can throw it up. all right. street fighter the movie

1778
06:22:13,830 --> 06:22:36,380
the game. all right. reach the goal to grab and at least 80 coins. let's go. uh what? right.

1779
06:22:36,380 --> 06:22:48,919
that's what it wants me to do. red the needle. nice. come on. do it again. idiot. can i?

1780
06:23:00,569 --> 06:23:10,520
i was so... i was staring at that 50. all i saw were dollar signs and nothing else.

1781
06:23:10,520 --> 06:23:20,630
i really am like a money bug. it's like a light source. i just saw money and i was like

1782
06:23:20,709 --> 06:23:30,470
money. give it to me. money. i don't understand what the hell they want me to do.

1783
06:23:31,110 --> 06:23:50,169
thread it. oh shit. all right. i'm all right. no. give me. i want to catch it. here we go.

1784
06:23:50,889 --> 06:24:02,970
perfect. get away from me. did i do it? 105. yep. how did he get that 30 down there?

1785
06:24:02,970 --> 06:24:18,279
what is up with that? what is going on here? what did it do? what did it do? what did that

1786
06:24:18,279 --> 06:24:36,099
do? there's a door. should i go in the door? oh no. that's the normal door. it stopped the

1787
06:24:36,099 --> 06:24:49,540
conveyor belt. i have enough money. we got work to do. now here's the thing. the re... how this

1788
06:24:49,540 --> 06:25:01,659
is possible to continue to... it's probably gonna be 10 plus hammers there. only five.

1789
06:25:01,659 --> 06:25:11,380
never mind. construction has started on the stained glass. okay. there's even more jobs to

1790
06:25:11,380 --> 06:25:21,689
do here. let me see. let's go all the way to the end for a second. 19. no. we already did these

1791
06:25:23,590 --> 06:25:35,159
here. invincible wind sprinter is currently the last one we have here. 100 coins under the sea.

1792
06:25:40,340 --> 06:25:50,740
grab all 100 coins. do it? no. i'll do the last couple. if they're still available, and

1793
06:25:50,740 --> 06:25:59,450
this kind of ends, you only have to do 60 or 70 levels. and i'll try some of the crazy

1794
06:25:59,450 --> 06:26:07,290
ones. and then i'll do a multiplayer night where i'll play a bunch of levels and then

1795
06:26:07,290 --> 06:26:12,869
do some multiplayer. i'll probably do that. let's see what's today. tomorrow's movie night.

1796
06:26:15,369 --> 06:26:22,299
so after tomorrow, i got... i want to do dark souls randomizer and then...

1797
06:26:24,060 --> 06:26:30,340
we'll do... all right. i got a plan. we're gonna do that. that got a lot lined up.

1798
06:26:30,340 --> 06:26:37,779
do i have to do this? i mean, i don't... you talk about the single player thing? no, not necessarily,

1799
06:26:37,779 --> 06:26:43,540
but i think it's kind of fun. plus, like i said before, i don't just want to jump into mario maker.

1800
06:26:43,540 --> 06:26:50,340
i want to, like, just get some good hours in just doing the single player and then

1801
06:26:50,340 --> 06:27:06,459
go hard on the multiplayer stuff. i'm going to do more cook serve delicious.

1802
06:27:06,619 --> 06:27:31,419
whenever, really. don't have a plan. and this is a relaxing level after the weird ones.

1803
06:27:31,419 --> 06:27:37,430
which, i'm probably going to do the enemies and items randomizer. it was heavily requested

1804
06:27:37,430 --> 06:27:44,360
long ago. seems like fun. so i'll probably do that. i don't think... i don't know if i'm

1805
06:27:44,360 --> 06:27:49,139
gonna do it with any other person, though. i feel like doing that with two people is hard

1806
06:27:49,139 --> 06:27:54,099
because if somebody dies, don't you have to, like, restart everything and, like, re-sum them

1807
06:27:54,099 --> 06:27:57,860
and stuff? i was gonna just kind of do a night where i do a bunch of weird things,

1808
06:27:58,340 --> 06:28:05,750
i was gonna just kind of do a night where i do a bunch of random weird ones.

1809
06:28:06,790 --> 06:28:18,819
but yeah, that's next week. well, i'll probably do tuesday, wednesday...

1810
06:28:19,860 --> 06:28:25,189
i gotta do... i gotta work on that carnival shit, though. i'm probably gonna have, like,

1811
06:28:25,189 --> 06:28:41,029
a meeting. i'll figure it out. the world's greatest cannon ride. that one is doing it

1812
06:28:41,029 --> 06:29:04,310
for me. i want to try it. termicorp board meeting. no. you see, i wouldn't be able

1813
06:29:04,310 --> 06:29:11,799
to do any of the things i'm doing right now if i had... remember mario maker 1? i couldn't

1814
06:29:11,799 --> 06:29:18,970
even make small jumps. i'll be ready for the the new levels in the multiplayer the next time i do

1815
06:29:18,970 --> 06:30:00,490
this. come on, get out of the way. gee, psycho! uh-oh, didn't have a good view. don't blow it

1816
06:30:00,490 --> 06:30:19,080
right before the... get up top. no, don't get up top. what do i do? oh, here. how do i get

1817
06:30:19,080 --> 06:30:54,869
that? like this? i got greedy and it was a mistake so far. don't die here. why do the bombs look so

1818
06:30:54,869 --> 06:31:06,389
weird? do they? to anyone who bought germa stock during the dread hall stream three months

1819
06:31:06,389 --> 06:31:14,220
ago, sell for profit. are you gonna sell my stock before the carnival? i think that would be

1820
06:31:14,220 --> 06:31:29,560
a mistake. what's the carnival? uh, oh yeah, that's right. i probably should talk about it

1821
06:31:29,560 --> 06:31:34,540
more often. at some point in the end of august or into somewhere into september,

1822
06:31:35,419 --> 06:31:40,540
i'm currently working with a robotics team and i'm making an entire twitch controls

1823
06:31:41,959 --> 06:31:48,650
carnival games stream. dunk tanks, claw games, and it's happening at some point in around

1824
06:31:48,650 --> 06:32:00,740
september. how long is that stream gonna be? it's gonna be at least four to six hours long.

1825
06:32:00,740 --> 06:32:09,659
has to be. and i'll be on the dunk tank yet. this is a project that is a very very long

1826
06:32:09,659 --> 06:32:13,979
time in the making. i really wanted this to happen like back in like april or march, but

1827
06:32:16,069 --> 06:32:27,340
kind of just didn't. but now it is. it's finally gonna happen. how many votes will it take to dunk

1828
06:32:27,340 --> 06:32:33,099
you? well, that's the thing. i don't really want to talk about it too much because i'd rather some

1829
06:32:33,099 --> 06:32:39,580
of it, at least most of it, be a surprise and more uh more than just like, hey here's everything

1830
06:32:39,580 --> 06:32:45,669
that's gonna happen. because there's a lot of shit that's gonna happen on that stream

1831
06:32:45,669 --> 06:32:50,310
that at least is planned to happen. so i'd rather not just be like, and here's this is

1832
06:32:50,310 --> 06:32:52,229
gonna happen and this is gonna happen and then this is gonna happen and then this is gonna

1833
06:32:52,229 --> 06:33:00,180
happen at the end. but you will have- i will tell you very specific dates, very specific times,

1834
06:33:01,060 --> 06:33:04,979
weeks in advance, if not potentially a month in advance of when the stream is gonna happen.

1835
06:33:05,700 --> 06:33:20,439
how did i do that without- i was barely paying attention to that one. million dollar joke.

1836
06:33:22,439 --> 06:33:29,740
not that much, but um for those of you- i won't give- no no no that's not- no i don't

1837
06:33:29,740 --> 06:33:39,209
want to do that. no, it's too early. too early to talk about that. you'll see. you'll see.

1838
06:33:39,770 --> 06:34:07,209
uh oh. 10? oh i could have got it right there. is there gonna be a clown? just know this.

1839
06:34:09,509 --> 06:34:17,540
i'm going as hard as i possibly can on this stream. i don't need- i don't want to say

1840
06:34:17,540 --> 06:34:32,650
anything else. that's all i really need to say. i can't have that just empty here,

1841
06:34:32,650 --> 06:34:47,669
you know what i mean? i have to do it. climbing twister cave. do you ever feel

1842
06:34:47,669 --> 06:34:56,020
nervous about doing big streams like that before them? no, not really. because it's

1843
06:34:56,020 --> 06:35:02,060
just like that shit that i've- oh come on i missed those. because by the time that you see

1844
06:35:02,060 --> 06:35:09,500
something on stream, i've probably gone over it a dozen times. i probably like talked about it

1845
06:35:09,500 --> 06:35:14,939
or planned it for weeks in advance. so i want to do it and i want to get going and i want

1846
06:35:14,939 --> 06:35:22,919
to do it now. you know what i mean? usually like at least a week or two in advance a

1847
06:35:22,919 --> 06:35:26,439
lot of those like random streams like that that would happen. oh come on i can get that.

1848
06:35:27,240 --> 06:35:34,470
do the people helping you actually know what you're doing? oh yeah and they're very much

1849
06:35:34,470 --> 06:35:45,080
included and on board. they're very excited about it too because it's just hopefully it's

1850
06:35:45,080 --> 06:35:55,500
just going to be a really fun project to do. really? are you going to come out like that?

1851
06:35:56,759 --> 06:36:09,139
well do it again. that's not a good idea. do it from here. it's 30 coins i have to try.

1852
06:36:09,700 --> 06:36:17,220
jesus i don't think i can make this jump from here. god damn it i knew that was going to

1853
06:36:17,220 --> 06:36:27,430
happen. thank the people helping with this for us. yeah you- they're- you will know-

1854
06:36:28,950 --> 06:36:34,979
you'll know exactly who they are because this is gonna- they'll be very- it'll be very evident

1855
06:36:34,979 --> 06:36:55,340
on who is- i did it again because the people that are working on this it's- they have like

1856
06:36:55,340 --> 06:37:05,349
a legit mobile unit. you know it's not- it's not like the last big big big project i did

1857
06:37:05,349 --> 06:37:10,470
which was essentially- it was germa rumble live was the last huge project that i really

1858
06:37:10,709 --> 06:37:18,729
really did. that was me and like my friends and a couple of people. this is a bunch of people that

1859
06:37:18,729 --> 06:37:24,540
do this kind of shit for a living so- and it has to be that way because there's a lot going on

1860
06:37:24,540 --> 06:37:37,580
in this stream that there has to be a lot of people essentially working on it. i gotta be

1861
06:37:37,580 --> 06:37:42,299
careful i have no health. yes i called it health but that's kind of what it is.

1862
06:37:43,259 --> 06:37:47,849
am i gonna put an act on or is it gonna be- it's i mean it's kind of just gonna be me.

1863
06:37:48,569 --> 06:38:10,700
holy fuck i thought that was an enemy one two three go i'll do that get it

1864
06:38:13,400 --> 06:38:22,180
really i've been moving real quick haven't i i haven't been moving fast how much more is there

1865
06:38:23,340 --> 06:38:43,049
oh yeah yay no he's killing everybody holy shit at least i have the time back

1866
06:38:46,900 --> 06:39:00,919
don't b come on press b try to bring a bomb up there i feel like that'll help

1867
06:39:12,700 --> 06:39:13,500
no give me a new one

1868
06:39:17,500 --> 06:39:27,299
no that's not gonna work i needed that extra hit for this he's kind of just has to kill

1869
06:39:27,299 --> 06:39:59,930
everything otherwise i'll fly into him i'll just leave one i could probably go now okay one two

1870
06:39:59,930 --> 06:40:19,860
three whatever the courtroom stream that i mentioned on the podcast we just couldn't get

1871
06:40:19,860 --> 06:40:25,750
it done it just wasn't gonna happen we had we were in contact with a couple of different

1872
06:40:25,750 --> 06:40:32,389
courts and a couple of different groups that wanted to kind of do it but they flaked out both

1873
06:40:32,389 --> 06:40:46,009
of them essentially at the very last second they were like eh stop returning emails and it was

1874
06:40:46,009 --> 06:40:53,220
good we were gonna have uh santa's uh oh i'm taking taking down the fourth wall here

1875
06:40:54,020 --> 06:41:03,020
um media meteor showdown meowser showdown what the hell is this the chief has been abducted

1876
06:41:03,020 --> 06:41:10,330
by bowser here's the last one we need to go it's the only difficulty level three uh we're

1877
06:41:10,330 --> 06:41:17,049
gonna have santa's prosecutor was going to just sing all of his lines and we had a guy that was

1878
06:41:17,049 --> 06:41:25,740
perfect for it there's gonna be christmas be music in the background while he sang all of

1879
06:41:25,740 --> 06:41:35,259
his lines there's gonna be character witnesses it's gonna be ridiculous why well because he's

1880
06:41:35,259 --> 06:41:56,810
like santa's magic fucking attorney so he's of course he's gonna be a christmas spirit kind

1881
06:41:56,810 --> 06:42:10,330

1892
06:45:27,799 --> 06:45:50,340
whole thing again all right get me through this get me through this first part of the level

1893
06:45:50,340 --> 06:46:07,979
gimmick why i tried to hit the one time that i pressed the down button and it doesn't work

1894
06:46:10,020 --> 06:46:25,000
i'm so ready i'm so ready i think i've been pressing on these buttons too hard for so long

1895
06:46:27,799 --> 06:46:33,619
that i drained the battery faster like i think i've been pressing too many buttons that have

1896
06:46:33,619 --> 06:46:42,439
drained the battery faster it feels a little less fluid i have to shake up my controllers to

1897
06:46:42,439 --> 06:46:47,849
recharge them just wait till they start doing that shit i can't wait you know those like

1898
06:46:47,849 --> 06:46:52,090
flashlights that you shake and they get charged that's gonna happen pretty soon with wireless

1899
06:46:52,090 --> 06:47:11,159
controllers you're probably gonna get out of the way try just to step on his hands

1900
06:47:12,040 --> 06:47:27,959
i'm just fucking panicking right now i'll just go all right here we go i'm not gonna get the

1901
06:47:27,959 --> 06:47:48,580
coin this time i'm just gonna beat the level i'm not gonna be an idiot up okey dokey turn

1902
06:47:48,580 --> 06:48:11,979
let's go there's a lot of unnecessary animals that i just ran over just get out of the car

1903
06:48:12,619 --> 06:48:16,950
please don't tell me the lava is gonna be right here i'm gonna go right into it

1904
06:48:35,080 --> 06:48:46,299

1905
06:48:56,229 --> 06:49:23,700
i what am i doing give me the pow no give me the pow stop all right throw it at him

1906
06:49:23,700 --> 06:50:07,740
why is he a cat too why are we both cats coins beautiful there's more i think i beat the

1907
06:50:07,740 --> 06:50:17,209
story i think i did it i completed the first time ever in over 10 years i just beat a mario

1908
06:50:17,209 --> 06:50:36,840
game in quotes i did it i rescued the chief fresh air finally i owe you one mario

1909
06:50:38,900 --> 06:50:42,490
stained glass is finished we're almost done there's one more thing to do

1910
06:50:46,619 --> 06:51:02,229
100 that's it now that was just a model now zoom out we got to do the whole castle see

1911
06:51:02,229 --> 06:51:11,139
you in 500 hours my name could go down in history for this but now is not the time for that let's

1912
06:51:11,139 --> 06:51:41,939
go to get princess peach cutscene mario you haven't changed clothes in like seven or eight

1913
06:51:41,939 --> 06:52:09,830
days you aimed those at bowser when he came to try to kill you all we even he even says

1914
06:52:09,830 --> 06:52:20,180
thank you for playing thank you for playing because they're fireworks you don't think if

1915
06:52:20,180 --> 06:52:25,220
you get a firework one of the big ones shot directly in your face it's something bad wouldn't

1916
06:52:25,220 --> 06:52:34,979
happen is he gonna press the button again and redo them are we in an infinite loop hey look

1917
06:52:34,979 --> 06:53:06,229
at that that was fun i think we're chasing him that was really fun seven hours of six to seven

1918
06:53:06,229 --> 06:53:19,080
hours and there's still like 20 or 30 levels that are there i'm gonna check and see after

1919
06:53:19,080 --> 06:53:39,240
credits what it looks like now i'm ready for super expert mode yeah that'll have to be for

1920
06:53:39,319 --> 06:53:46,119
another night though i'm gonna go check out the other levels that were the

1921
06:53:46,119 --> 06:53:59,580
final ones though isn't super expert gone actually i think it's just an endless mode right

1922
06:54:00,299 --> 06:54:24,220
it's no longer is it normal hard super hard i like this rendition they removed 100 lives

1923
06:54:24,220 --> 06:54:30,979
with the difficulties the same that makes sense i kind of liked the 100 lives thing though

1924
06:54:32,409 --> 06:54:39,319
it gave you that pressure that you only had 100 tries to get somewhere it's kind of

1925
06:54:39,319 --> 06:54:44,740
interesting although if you did run into one of those levels during the 100 mario challenge

1926
06:54:45,700 --> 06:54:50,419
if you run into one of the troll levels that guaranteed you were going to lose like 40 times

1927
06:54:50,419 --> 06:55:04,389
i mean that did happen didn't it you could skip yeah you could skip that's right that's

1928
06:55:04,389 --> 06:55:18,330
true the co-op sounds fun when it actually starts to work right isn't there isn't it not

1929
06:55:18,330 --> 06:55:24,919
that great right now didn't they not even add a bunch of the co-op multiplayer features

1930
06:55:24,919 --> 06:55:59,319
into the game yet no online with friends until later how much later you gotta buy it i thought

1931
06:55:59,319 --> 06:56:11,529
you just had to have the nintendo online pass thing well that was cute i want to go back and

1932
06:56:11,529 --> 06:56:23,159
see oh i got the hard hat it can actually be in builder mario super hammer wait you've earned a

1933
06:56:23,159 --> 06:56:30,919
new part you can use it in the super mario 3d world game style in course maker so you have

1934
06:56:30,919 --> 06:56:35,720
to play through the whole thing to get the super hammer congratulations on completing peach's

1935
06:56:35,720 --> 06:56:39,319
castle you can make all kinds of courses like the ones you played in story mode head over the

1936
06:56:39,319 --> 06:56:59,290
course maker and bring your ideas to life where's peach is she here is peach like on the level

1937
06:57:04,900 --> 06:57:20,419
what's your problem thanks mario oh new job from princess peach i think that's what he just

1938
06:57:20,419 --> 06:57:31,479
said let's go builder mario clear the way with the super hammer you need to only create a

1939
06:57:31,479 --> 06:57:35,080
builder box with up and why could you give that a try and see if you can reach the

1940
06:57:35,080 --> 06:57:44,340
goal this is from peach and i got a gear so this is the super secret princess peach end

1941
06:57:44,340 --> 06:57:54,580
of the video game after the credits post credit scene oh shit what the hell all right hold on

1942
06:57:54,580 --> 06:58:09,130
what this is crazy so you can build blocks and i only have three i guess i can have more than

1943
06:58:09,130 --> 06:58:26,459
three there's a lot of cool use cases for this oh you can only have okay you can only

1944
06:58:26,459 --> 06:58:50,779
have a certain amount dig mario dig reflexes like a goddamn animal can i yeah wait there's

1945
06:58:50,779 --> 06:59:08,330
something over here now i miss the mario has the hammer he didn't really have a hammer anymore

1946
06:59:08,330 --> 06:59:14,599
does he they put mario in all kinds of like fursuits but they don't really you don't utilize

1947
06:59:14,599 --> 06:59:39,400
his hammer anymore what is this the wall well he has it now that oh this hurts you right

1948
06:59:40,119 --> 07:00:05,659
right oh look out can't whoa all right well they can't be killed can they be boxed

1949
07:00:05,659 --> 07:00:31,619
no i just slingshot it down that hole i went so fast down that hole get over here

1950
07:00:38,220 --> 07:01:01,419
box it up again please thank you okay oh because i hit the wall that's why

1951
07:01:03,419 --> 07:01:14,360
all right don't screw this up again please so what am i doing wrong here you have to block

1952
07:01:14,360 --> 07:01:41,509
them off yeah that worked cool mechanic just jump over them do try this level i'm not going

1953
07:01:41,509 --> 07:01:50,340
to do any online levels tonight doll the princess pete's dress cool i'm gonna be wrapping

1954
07:01:50,340 --> 07:01:59,479
it up here seven hours probably take about 40 30 40 minutes to the bits i'm getting a little

1955
07:01:59,479 --> 07:02:07,180
tired but i am going to do a multiplayer and we're gonna do it again we're gonna do it

1956
07:02:15,509 --> 07:02:22,360
that was fun just to do all that i've had that was i loved that and now i got the necessary skill

1957
07:02:22,360 --> 07:02:26,840
set to be able to play online and do the levels and do the and that also gives time for people

1958
07:02:26,840 --> 07:02:31,880
to make some stuff there is stuff that already exists i'm sure that's great good luck because

1959
07:02:31,880 --> 07:02:35,240
multiplayer is wonky and not that great but that's what i mean maybe over the next

1960
07:02:36,729 --> 07:02:43,369
three or four days right maybe they'll fix out kink out some of the bugs but i'm ready for

1961
07:02:43,369 --> 07:02:54,659
the online stuff the other story levels yeah i mean maybe i'll work here's okay here uh listen

1962
07:02:55,220 --> 07:03:00,979
let me just slow down and then use my words clearly because i'm talking over myself speaking

1963
07:03:00,979 --> 07:03:08,490
somehow uh i will warm up with some of the harder ones here and then that i'm going to

1964
07:03:08,490 --> 07:03:13,130
do that for less than like probably 20 30 minutes and then we'll spend a good like

1965
07:03:13,130 --> 07:03:20,389
regular stream time between like six to eight hours doing all the online stuff i'm ready

1966
07:03:22,169 --> 07:03:27,540
but it can't happen tomorrow because tomorrow is the green screen movie encore night again if

1967
07:03:27,540 --> 07:03:30,259
you do not have that this is the last chance you're going to get probably the last time

1968
07:03:30,259 --> 07:03:37,619
i'm going to talk about it until obviously the stream is tomorrow did i explore everything i

1969
07:03:37,619 --> 07:03:47,270
think i saw all this secret stuff no i didn't thank you for saving the chief we couldn't have

1970
07:03:47,270 --> 07:03:50,630
done it without you that said mario you could probably get into that pipe you forgot

1971
07:03:50,630 --> 07:04:02,139
rid of that piranha creeper and look to a tomorrow i might just do this tomorrow because

1972
07:04:02,139 --> 07:04:12,459
it depends how long the movie night is you know you know what you know because the movie

1973
07:04:13,020 --> 07:04:20,459
the encore movie night is only going to be a couple hours that's not going to be that long

1974
07:04:22,520 --> 07:04:37,659
so why not either do that first and then just do mario maker again that makes sense i think

1975
07:04:38,299 --> 07:04:42,250
because it's not like i don't want to turn the stream on and turn it off in like an

1976
07:04:42,330 --> 07:04:51,909
hour and 25 minutes all right that's the plan if for some crazy reason the movie the green

1977
07:04:51,909 --> 07:04:55,909
screen night takes like four or five hours which i don't think there's no way it will

1978
07:04:58,729 --> 07:05:02,250
we'll just uh do the multiplayer stuff tomorrow we'll do the online courses tomorrow and stuff

1979
07:05:06,569 --> 07:05:09,930
the last movie night stream was seven hours or so this one shouldn't be that yeah especially

1980
07:05:09,930 --> 07:05:21,400
there's going to be like 60 less videos than the first one but that's where i'm going to

1981
07:05:21,400 --> 07:05:28,259
wrap it up but time tomorrow we're going to start at three to four something between three

1982
07:05:28,259 --> 07:05:37,340
and four p.m get three coins to be funny i'll do it some other day yeah the last movie night

1983
07:05:37,340 --> 07:05:44,330
had hundreds of videos this is going to be probably less than a hundred so maybe uh i'll

1984
07:05:44,330 --> 07:05:54,340
probably i don't know we'll we'll gauge the room but that's happening tomorrow i want to

1985
07:05:54,340 --> 07:05:58,659
link the form one more time if somebody didn't get it because obviously this is the last

1986
07:05:58,659 --> 07:06:13,209
chance you're going to get me shouting this out grab the link i might as well turn this on too

1987
07:06:13,930 --> 07:06:25,299
uh if you leave i'll see you tomorrow same time starting somewhere around three to four p.m

1988
07:06:25,299 --> 07:06:36,439
pacific potentially earlier it depends on when i uh get up and get going but plan for the

1989
07:06:36,439 --> 07:06:46,580
normal time anywho if you've taken off hopefully we see you tomorrow if not maybe

1990
07:06:46,580 --> 07:07:00,180
we'll see you again soon let me just go let me grab the grab this here is the submission form

1991
07:07:00,180 --> 07:07:14,220
only submit once not more than once have it be less than three minutes and again this is not

1992
07:07:14,220 --> 07:07:23,540
a contest so not all submissions don't if your submission doesn't get picked it's not like it

1993
07:07:23,540 --> 07:07:28,979
wasn't any good we're just trying to condense them down into ones that are not so similar

1994
07:07:28,979 --> 07:07:34,259
and some of that are maybe a little bit higher quality and don't see the same kind of thing over

1995
07:07:34,259 --> 07:07:40,950
and over again right it's not a contest and after this is all done and i'm going to probably see

1996
07:07:40,950 --> 07:07:46,069
if we can do just another big playlist and not stream it but have a second encore playlist

1997
07:07:46,709 --> 07:07:52,470
with most of the submissions or at least some of the ones that were um that we could show

1998
07:07:52,470 --> 07:07:57,479
afterwards you know but uh i'm gonna just go p i'll be right back we'll do the bits

1999
07:07:58,279 --> 07:08:02,340
and i will be right back see you sure

2000
07:09:30,900 --> 07:09:57,319
just walking back up i feel like a bad migraine right now where the hell will this come from

2001
07:10:01,099 --> 07:10:10,500
strange being old probably well we don't have very there's not a whole lot of bits tonight

2002
07:10:10,500 --> 07:10:18,900
so we should be able to get through this pretty quickly mario migraine now i probably

2003
