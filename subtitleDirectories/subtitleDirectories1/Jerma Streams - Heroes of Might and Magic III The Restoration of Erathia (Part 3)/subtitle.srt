1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:14,390
The music stopped because I'm opening another game, as you know, as you are aware.

2
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:53,109
I'm gonna mute this one more time. Give me one sec. Okay, I need to change this. I gotta change the

3
00:00:53,109 --> 00:01:07,819
game as well. Move you over. That looks better. That's better, right?

4
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:33,269
That looks good. So from last time, I was about to lose. Very, very, very awfully. My partner was

5
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:51,349
doing terrible. But let's see if I can do anything here. Here's my magic three. The yellow bar.

6
00:01:52,069 --> 00:02:00,010
I'll get rid of the yellow bar. Ready? Check this out. Gone. Not even there. All right.

7
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:11,860
Updated load game. It was a single scenario. Which one was it? I have no idea. Timeline two.

8
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:27,110
Battle. Do we have times on these? We do. Is it conquerors? 530? No. 529. 530 at 2039.

9
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:36,969
530 at 1808. Original team timeline. There we go. Yeah. 2358. That's just before midnight.

10
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:48,699
I think this is it. Am I not playing Sam and Max? I just did. I completed season two. Now I need to

11
00:02:48,699 --> 00:03:00,259
complete this. That is what we're doing today. All right, let's go here. I think this is it.

12
00:03:00,259 --> 00:03:10,259
Let's see. So it was purple was doing nothing. Purple has like a dwarf in here, right?

13
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:18,699
I need to finish my losing camp. We have to get closure, but it's not lost yet. Remember,

14
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:24,979
I was wiping out people. I was taking people out left and right. He doesn't have very much

15
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:34,490
left. He has this. And that's it. Change the game. I already did. You need to refresh your browser.

16
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:43,159
Refresh your Twitch browser, please. It's not over yet. See, he's starting to build up a little

17
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:53,110
bit. Red is almost dead. So let's see what I can do. Let me try to remember what the plan.

18
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:58,539
I still have like good army. I'm going to be making money. I have tons of money. Let's go

19
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:04,419
down here. All right. Lots of money. What do I want to build? Behemoth lair. Let's build it.

20
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:18,220
I got the money. Oh, let's just start. Look, get him. Okay, we got a behemoth. I still can

21
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:28,329
move around here. What is this? This is the big one here. And then, yeah, not that well

22
00:04:28,329 --> 00:04:34,379
defended. He only has like one castle that has anything in it. Two maybe, but if I can...

23
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:46,379
I just... I just need purple to do anything. All right, here we go. I'm going for it.

24
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:56,339
Like right here. Let me just take this. Everything's good down here.

25
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:10,939
New day. Did you actually just take that from purple? How is red still alive? I don't understand.

26
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:17,300
Like red sucks. I have to send somebody over here to do something about this because this

27
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:25,829
is all red has. They don't have anything else. Okay, what do we got? Let's build some more

28
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:41,750
stuff. Chris's goblin production. Orc tower. Upgrade the behemoth lair. Maybe. Just to have

29
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:51,449
better behemoths. What's the difference? Target enemy's defenses reduced by 80%. That's pretty

30
00:05:51,449 --> 00:06:02,199
awesome. Curse that volume just a little. All right. Things are not looking bad. I have tons

31
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:06,040
of troop availability. I just need some money. Let's just even them out a little.

32
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:17,899
All right. You got several. Few, few, few, and few. He has... I don't... That's not enough.

33
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:30,009
That's not enough to get this. It's enough to get... I really should just go up here.

34
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:53,660
Or all the way up here. Well, just get all the resources. You're fucked. Yeah, I know. I know.

35
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:59,750
But still. It's still possible. Well, these guys are gonna run away. Give me this.

36
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:09,879
Several... I think I can do this. What do we got down here? Tons of fucking people to buy.

37
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:17,449
And I just go for it. All right. There's red. There's red. There's red. They're both out here

38
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:45,259
now. Come on. Go for it. Take something. Help me out here. Build. I already got this stuff.

39
00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:51,579
Yeah. Just claim all the resources. The map is shit. That's the problem. I played a tough

40
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:58,889
game, but was able to use the map to my advantage to pull off an upset. Yeah. But it's

41
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:05,850
still possible. I can't just give up right now. I mean, this was such a good comeback.

42
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:11,879
I had such an opportunity. I can't. I'm like sunk cost fallacy right now.

43
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:22,120
I just gotta get somebody up there. Where's my nearest castle? Right here. Either right

44
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:27,540
there or right here. This is probably faster because it's a straight line. All right. What

45
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:32,309
can I do in here? I got plenty of fucking people next time. What about you? Let's go

46
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:44,379
with you. Several horde lots. What do you think I can do it? Think I can take this castle over

47
00:08:44,379 --> 00:08:54,470
right now? What button do I press to hire all available units? I'll show you. So in here,

48
00:08:55,110 --> 00:09:00,059
right here, this is a little castle building. You click it and it'll show you all available

49
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:07,450
that you can buy and you can just buy them all. No, I can't. I have to take like a...

50
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:19,750
What about this one? No. What about up here? These are easier to take. You know, just like

51
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:27,559
get over there. How far away is he? He's really fucking far away, isn't he? Yeah, he's like too

52
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:43,419
far away to do this. What do you have? Fuck. Is this a dead game? This might be dead.

53
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:57,929
You horde pack. Fuck. No, I was doing so well too. I'm playing it out. Here comes red.

54
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:10,220
Here. Which, what do I have here? All right. Let's get some units in here.

55
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:24,299
You have horde, horde. He has a lot, but horde of fairies is nothing. This should be okay.

56
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:32,899
I'll give this another few rounds and then decide if it's time to throw the towel in.

57
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:50,419
How do I get up here? I am claiming a bunch of shit, but it doesn't matter. They've...

58
00:10:51,379 --> 00:11:02,409
Damn it. Here we go. They're coming in. I might be okay here. What's the most,

59
00:11:02,409 --> 00:11:13,460
this is the most dangerous thing. This. I wonder if I should just fly out the dragon,

60
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:25,179
but probably not. I can't, no spells, no hero in here. 50 elementals. Yeah, but they have to get

61
00:11:25,179 --> 00:11:35,529
in. I have one unit in double digits and it's the frog. Well, I'm not going to get out there

62
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:50,460
yet. Like, they can fly? No, they can't, can they? I mean, they can. I have like minotaurs

63
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:59,139
too. I should be all right once we... I mean, this is just one harpy here. Fuck, they can

64
00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:13,659
fly. Yeah, this is bad. I don't have a hero to cast any spells. Hey, look at me. I'm gonna go over

65
00:12:13,659 --> 00:12:32,820
here. They still have to get in. These are all powerful units. I think it's time for me to get

66
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:50,899
out here. He's just gonna fly in. I can kill these guys. There you are. Kill. I could go

67
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:54,019
out there and meet them on an open field. I'm not, I'm not gonna do that though.

68
00:12:54,899 --> 00:13:11,620
Here they are at the front door. Just cheese them. Good, be the bait for the range attacks here.

69
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:25,500
Fuck, it's open. Well, they can get in now. I think I should just fly out here.

70
00:13:31,289 --> 00:14:02,970
Stand like right here. Get down here. Nobody do anything. Get in the moat. Right in the moat.

71
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:17,690
Nice. Perfect. Come on. All right, where's my dragon? From this angle. Get him. I could

72
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:37,929
probably kill these in one or two hits. Get the dragon in the way. Come on. I don't want to fly

73
00:14:37,929 --> 00:14:49,690
him out there. They're gonna get in. Block the entrance. This is not terrible. I'm okay with

74
00:14:49,690 --> 00:15:13,110
this. It's all right. It's not over. This is the only unit that's really scary. Get rid of

75
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:27,259
this. No, come on. Good. Head down here. It doesn't matter. You're not gonna do shit.

76
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:33,539
Ah, fuck. I just blocked the angle. Completely. Go up here.

77
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:56,009
Chimera's gonna die. All right, come on. What do I have? 50? 12 to 20? They don't do that

78
00:15:56,009 --> 00:16:22,340
much damage. Get in there. God damn it. Die. Why can't I shoot anybody from here? This sucks.

79
00:16:23,299 --> 00:16:31,450
Out of ammo. Oh yeah. Well, unfortunately, this is going to be really, really close,

80
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:51,990
but it's not going to be enough. It's game over. 50 of these things. Didn't have a hero in here.

81
00:16:53,269 --> 00:17:00,490
Let's just fly. Just run away. Eventually I'm going to get hit by that arrow.

82
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:20,220
Yeah, eventually this will kill me. Yeah, I'm dead. Oh, this is so sad. Now this might be

83
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:35,319
unwinnable. Can I look at like stats? Can I see if they've done any damage to any other

84
00:17:35,319 --> 00:18:03,079
player? Fucking 2v2 in the tavern. I want to see. Number of towns. Gold. Plenty of wood and ore.

85
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:24,940
Look at this shit. Attack is zero. Zero two two two. How can you not be there? How is it

86
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:38,309
possible? Can I steal this? Can I take his ore? Warrior human explorer builder. It's not

87
00:18:38,309 --> 00:18:43,750
completely. I still have the one. I have this one really good army. I'm going to go for it.

88
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:48,549
Like fuck it. Let's just go for it. I'm going to stack units and then we're going to go.

89
00:18:53,109 --> 00:19:03,140
Bone dragons. What has like the best? Let's see. You got good shit. All these places have

90
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:15,529
good shit, but I don't have money. I might as well just buy all this and then bring you down

91
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:25,980
there. Eventually the vampires will do work. Yeah, I just, I think I'm just overwhelmed at

92
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:38,970
this point. I don't think it's like possible. It was worth a shot. What the hell are you doing?

93
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:52,869
Because I need to go to here with you. So you got to get up there next turn.

94
00:19:53,589 --> 00:20:04,819
Literally nothing. Although you are right next to it. More heroes can do more stuff.

95
00:20:04,819 --> 00:20:10,710
Yeah, that's true. But it's remember it's 2v1 right now because purple ain't doing shit.

96
00:20:11,509 --> 00:20:25,990
Purple's walking around in the circle picking up the same three resources. Can I get anything

97
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:38,579
from here? I guess I could just, just to take them. Take the unicorns. Just to have better

98
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:47,579
RV for now. I guess I could take these too. Just in case I run into somebody.

99
00:20:51,269 --> 00:20:54,150
All right, anything else? So before I go up here and get some more vampires.

100
00:20:58,809 --> 00:21:04,470
Guys, Dwarf's going to take this one. I'm going to get this one. Restock,

101
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:14,170
take over this one and see what happens. The vampires. Do they not? They don't have

102
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:39,269
upgraded vampires. How do you not have this? There are bone dragons here. Okay, next day.

103
00:21:42,089 --> 00:21:56,859
What? Did he just take me on? I don't think he wins this. I'm gonna have to, okay,

104
00:21:56,859 --> 00:22:05,059
I'm gonna have to do some, I don't have like ice arrow. Who's more dangerous?

105
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:11,910
Wyverns. Fuck. He has eight Wyverns. That's very bad.

106
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:30,839
Just hang out here for a second. What the fuck just happened? He just did Armageddon.

107
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:48,920
Come on. What? Everybody's dead. I had a chance. Hold on. Can I, let me just try and

108
00:22:48,920 --> 00:23:04,980
take this out. It's not gonna happen. Is it? Come on. Kill it. I'm so defeated right now.

109
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:31,539
That sucks. I probably would have done it too. Yeah, there goes my other hero. Let's see what

110
00:23:31,539 --> 00:23:49,400
purple's up to. I wonder. What did you do? Let me see. Nice, nice. So you walked from like

111
00:23:49,400 --> 00:24:01,880
here to here. Cool. You better stack this fucking castle up. Now. Plan doesn't change.

112
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:12,279
We're still going to this castle. Jerma's angry already. I'm just remembering how

113
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:17,960
annoyed I was with my teammate. I know I'm like the salty boy after, you know,

114
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:33,740
you can't blame the teammate, but yes you can. You can. I'm sorry. I'm gonna drown here. I'm

115
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:40,380
gonna drown. He has to take something. Please take something. This is, I put like nine hours

116
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:49,900
into this campaign. I can't give up on it. Get over here right now. Come here. Give me all

117
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:59,000
your stuff. Give it to me. I can't take it from you. I can only give. I can't take. No,

118
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,250
no, no. I don't want to give you my fucking dragons. What? No, no, no, no, no, no, no,

119
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:22,420
no. What just happened? What did I just get in return? Split creatures. No, I, I can't. Oh,

120
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:38,069
my fucking God. It's okay. I just said one guy just said it's because my army is full

121
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:47,299
and now I just gave him my fucking angels. Somebody said it's because your army's full.

122
00:25:47,859 --> 00:25:52,789
I've got to watch that stress. I, you just got the best fucking.

123
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:58,700
Uh, I, uh, why can I give, but I can't take from my ally? What if he's not going to give

124
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:08,890
to me from my fucking computer? You really close windows, select left hero,

125
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:19,059
and he's not going to do anything. He's going to take those units and walk around the circle

126
00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:40,970
down here. Just don't press the check mark. Can I just exit? No, no, no. These, I needed

127
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:50,009
these so bad. I think that's, I think this is the point where I quit. I haven't saved in

128
00:26:50,009 --> 00:27:17,480
a long time. When was the last auto safe? Let's see. Is this it? It is. Okay. Thank God.

129
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:27,589
Don't ever listen to Chad. No one's ever played this game. No, I mean, if it's a good,

130
00:27:27,589 --> 00:27:44,200
it was a decent theory. The losing campaign continues. Yes, it does. All right. If I'm

131
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:51,019
going to lose, I'm going to lose. I'm not going to just quit. You got me to

132
00:27:51,019 --> 00:27:54,539
download this game. Good. It's fantastic. I hope you enjoy it. It's a really,

133
00:27:54,539 --> 00:28:03,779
really good game. He already owned that windmill and he touched it again. I hate this guy.

134
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:16,359
All right. Let's stock up again. Got more vampires. I'm going to leave the angels

135
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:33,720
because, uh, what do you think? Angels or, um, dendroids looks kind of good.

136
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:43,099
And here is my only hope. Are you ready? It's called turtle forever and just try to get like

137
00:28:43,819 --> 00:29:02,970
15 dragons and like 150 vampires. I need to upgrade the skeletons though. That's my only shot.

138
00:29:03,609 --> 00:29:07,289
Somebody's got to come out with these. This is like not a bad army either.

139
00:29:07,289 --> 00:29:20,339
I'm making a new hero. Jeremy, you already made this Australia joke.

140
00:29:20,339 --> 00:29:27,130
Well, at this point, it's not a joke. It's real life. I'm living in reality right now.

141
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:37,740
They're coming for me and I'm not going to, I'm not going to go down. Winners don't turtle.

142
00:29:38,619 --> 00:29:51,019
All right. So I want, uh, this one upgrade the skeleton. I have already upgraded. I need to do

143
00:29:51,019 --> 00:29:59,160
this. What do I need for that? Dragon vault. I already have dread nights. All right. Dragon

144
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:08,259
vault, 15,000 gold. We're doing it. Let's just save the money while we have the second here.

145
00:30:08,259 --> 00:30:14,089
Let's get a new hero because there are, uh, ancient behemoths that are here now.

146
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:28,490
Okay. We need resource silo, freelance goblin barracks, ogre fort, escape tunnel.

147
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:44,839
No, let's just get a hero. I mean, yeah, I really, it needs to be this person.

148
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:49,450
Okay. You hang out there for now. I'm going to get you an army too.

149
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:55,220
You take this because no one has even secured it. What the fuck are they thinking?

150
00:30:55,859 --> 00:31:10,779
I got the new spell. I'm ready. They're all working together. This is,

151
00:31:10,779 --> 00:31:15,559
he has so many heroes. He doesn't know what to do with it. This one just stood still.

152
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:21,609
He has like 12 heroes across two players and now they're coming for me.

153
00:31:24,619 --> 00:31:31,640
No, what do you have? Uh, I don't think it's possible to defend this pack of,

154
00:31:32,619 --> 00:31:37,880
uh, God damn it. That's when I think I'm, I get a minute to breathe.

155
00:31:39,099 --> 00:31:45,619
Well, I'm going to try. I'm going to try to defend it with my level one hero.

156
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:56,220
Ah, two more days through until a new week. What do you got? Lots of this game.

157
00:32:00,569 --> 00:32:09,420
I don't think I'm going to be able to do this one. I need like a final battle though,

158
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:15,180
just so I can say that I completed it. It was game over two hours ago. Yeah, I know,

159
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,819
but I just had to see it again because I left really abruptly.

160
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:45,299
You come with your firebirds. The behemoths didn't do anything.

161
00:32:46,099 --> 00:32:49,700
No, this is just embarrassing. Really? Yeah. At least I'm trying, right?

162
00:32:50,579 --> 00:33:01,690
Start a new map. Um, I don't think so. I think I'm going to hold onto that because starting

163
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:05,289
because then we'll, the same situation will happen. I'll get like a quarter of the way

164
00:33:05,289 --> 00:33:09,859
through a map. I'd rather do like a full, like seven to 10 hours stream of the game

165
00:33:10,579 --> 00:33:14,579
rather than play it for like another hour or two on a new map and then we save it

166
00:33:14,579 --> 00:33:20,039
and it disappears for two weeks. Tomorrow is cooking simulators. We're not doing it tomorrow.

167
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:34,599
I may as well just die. Do a real cooking stream.

168
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:40,710
Worth mentioning that this is three nine, three dollars and 39 cents right now on good old games.

169
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:46,140
Just get it. This is less than a fucking medium coffee at Starbucks. Go get this game.

170
00:33:47,660 --> 00:34:01,720
Seriously. Unfortunately, the first stream I did, the game I think was 10 bucks

171
00:34:07,619 --> 00:34:11,670
and this is where we lose. I need one more big battle.

172
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:16,150
There's going to be one more big battle that I have to at least go out with.

173
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:23,030
You know, I can't just let, I can't just lose. I'm sticking my tongue out at them while they rush.

174
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:30,219
I got it because I saw you playing it. Yeah. It's very interesting.

175
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:38,920
It's a very, very fun chill game. Big one sided battle. I don't think so. Next,

176
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:42,440
this next week here, I'm going to, I'm taking off and we're going to see what we can do

177
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:55,820
with upgraded bone dragons. I'll take six of them. Jeremy needs to get spanked hard

178
00:34:55,820 --> 00:35:01,739
before he goes to his room for good. No, you're talking about like in the getting

179
00:35:01,739 --> 00:35:07,980
beat in the game. Oh my God. What the fuck. All right. It's almost time to go out here.

180
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:16,150
I still live in the castle. Podcast listener just gave 50 dollars.

181
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:27,449
Podcast listener. Thank you for the 50 bucks. 5,000 bits. Love your streams, dude. Thanks for

182
00:35:27,449 --> 00:35:35,239
everything you do. German heart. Much love back to you. Thank you for 50 fucking dollars.

183
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:51,900
5,000 bits. Podcast listener. Thank you so much. A lot of money. 5,000 this lot.

184
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,860
There was, they've been like three or four of these tonight. Thank you guys.

185
00:35:55,579 --> 00:36:09,380
Twitch added a reward system. They did. What do you mean reward system? You get like bits

186
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:13,800
or something. What does that mean? I don't know what it means. All right. Here comes the next

187
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:25,780
week. I'm ready to move. I'm going to, I'm going to fucking explode here. I had to go

188
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:33,099
out with a bang. I have to take somebody with me and like part of me is like actually

189
00:36:33,099 --> 00:36:41,079
thinking about declaring war on purple and killing him. Can I do that? Is that possible?

190
00:36:41,719 --> 00:36:55,639
Can I? Is there a way? Did purple go through the same portal loop three times? Probably.

191
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:15,099
System option scenario info. Is there declare war? No, I can't declare war. That's

192
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:27,590
unfortunate. All right, here we go. Two more dragons. Four more of these.

193
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:38,469
Eight more of these. I should have a substantial army at this point. Some more skeletons.

194
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:42,070
And then we're going to upgrade the dragons and then we're going to get the hell out of here

195
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:58,099
and I'm going to just steamroll somebody. Mow the lawn IRL. I'm not sure you're aware

196
00:37:58,099 --> 00:38:03,719
of this, but there are really, there's not really much thing as a lawn in Las Vegas.

197
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:22,440
It'd be mold of rocks. Hey, let's do it again. Back to bed. Rake the sand. What do I need?

198
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:29,300
10,000? 15,000? I think he just took something from me.

199
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:57,719
Damn. Damn it. Okay, here we go. Dragon vault. There it is. Now I need to wait

200
00:38:57,719 --> 00:39:09,480
one more day. I may as well just wait the whole week. What did he just do that for?

201
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:17,820
He's just playing with portals now. He just did the portal infinite loop thing for fun.

202
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:31,460
Five super dragons. Look, let's just wait the whole week. I'm just waiting the whole

203
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:47,929
week. Who cares? I already lost. It doesn't matter. I don't care about this. Nothing

204
00:39:47,929 --> 00:39:54,949
matters. Don't even give him satisfaction. Run through the escape hole. What is this?

205
00:39:55,829 --> 00:40:21,289
No. Turn on auto combat. I can't even surrender. There's no one to surrender. Hey,

206
00:40:21,289 --> 00:40:33,079
at least I took out one of their sand wind people. This is sad. Sad. It's okay. At least

207
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:40,199
I've saw to its completion. That's all I care about. Here's what I will be really mad about

208
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:48,070
though. If I lose before purple does, that's what's gonna happen. That's so I'm gonna be,

209
00:40:48,070 --> 00:41:00,820
I'm gonna go to sleep tonight angry. I'm not supposed to get angry. What does purple have?

210
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:14,940
Purple has like two castles and like two or three heroes. What does purple have? Does

211
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:19,739
purple even have a house? Yeah, look, he's, I mean, doesn't have shit, but still. Oh,

212
00:41:19,739 --> 00:41:24,710
here we go. Yes, I could stop this right now, but I'm not going to want him to die.

213
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:32,280
Just so I can at least be the one that survived. Let's watch this one boys and girls and see how

214
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:57,769
this happens. No, you're not going to do it. Habitage. All right. This is the end. Eight

215
00:41:58,489 --> 00:42:05,849
ghost dragons. 29. I gotta wait to get some more vampires. We're gonna wait.

216
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:12,679
Here's the thing though. This really might be really powerful and I might kill these two

217
00:42:12,679 --> 00:42:32,489
or three of their heroes and then I'll die. It's okay. At least I'll die going down.

218
00:42:33,619 --> 00:42:39,590
Wait, no, at least I'll fight. I'll take them on. Whatever you, what I'm trying to say is just,

219
00:42:39,590 --> 00:43:05,110
give me another week. Yeah, I'm gonna sell them. Sell, sell everything. Sell all. Marketplace.

220
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:12,119
Where's the marketplace here? All right. This is, I don't want to do this, but I am.

221
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:16,059
Sell it all. Wait, what do I need for the dragons? I already have as many as I can get.

222
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:24,710
Sell. Who cares? We'll clean it out. The coffer is here.

223
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:51,420
78. All right. What? Anything else? I got $10,000. Should I get? All right. Chad, listen to me here.

224
00:43:51,420 --> 00:44:08,760
Unicorns or 60 whites? I can up, what do you think? Super whites? Unicorns or 60 upgraded

225
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:25,860
whites? Let's see what they look like. 3 to 5, 18 health. 18 to 22, 90. There's only four

226
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:38,730
unicorns. Yeah. All right. Last week. One more day. Somebody said, what a disaster.

227
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:47,619
It's all right. We're just, we're just chilling. We're just having fun.

228
00:44:47,619 --> 00:44:53,610
We're just hanging out. Thanks, purple. He noticed I had zero in everything.

229
00:44:54,329 --> 00:45:02,900
You know, it'd be really great if you did anything else besides give me like

230
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:10,780
10 of each resource. All right. Drain's enemy mana. Undead. Regenerating.

231
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:23,159
Aura of magic resistance. Blinding attack. Hates devils. This is it. This is the team.

232
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:42,150
I'm ready to go. Where do I go first? All right. You decide. Where are we going?

233
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:46,230
Top left, top right, bottom right, or bottom left? Which one?

234
00:45:52,809 --> 00:46:04,630
Stay put. Wait, you want me just to sit here? Stay put? Hold. I have to get out of here.

235
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:12,260
You want me to stay? I can't just stay here. It's never going to end.

236
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:16,260
They're never going to stop running around and collecting resources.

237
00:46:30,699 --> 00:46:36,380
No, I got to go. I got to go. They won't even come over here. I have to go to them.

238
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:42,170
They're never going to come over here. I'm going. Getting 999 skeletons. That's going to

239
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:52,380
take fucking like seven more months. I'm going. First course of action is top right,

240
00:46:52,380 --> 00:47:02,820
I think. Middle right. We're taking this. Let's go. I'm not fucking, I don't care

241
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:14,199
if I lose my capital. I'll get one. Top right? I mean, that's where we're going.

242
00:47:20,139 --> 00:47:41,960
Right here. I'll take this. We're in Orange's world. Yeah. We are in an orange world. And

243
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:47,110
then I'm going in this thing. And wherever that ends up, whatever. Here comes a battle.

244
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:58,889
There he goes. Just waiting for me to leave. Purple's dead. That was very anti-climactic.

245
00:48:05,579 --> 00:48:10,860
Purple, I think, officially is dead. They don't have anything. You have one hero,

246
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:21,030
I think, right? That's all you got. This dumb motherfucker still has default skeletons.

247
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:34,340
I hate this guy. Might as well go with a fighter. It doesn't matter. I'm going to get your

248
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:44,570
castle anyways. Did more than you. No, he didn't. No, he didn't. All right. Well,

249
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:49,739
you don't even. What's earthquake? This earthquake. Do I have earthquake?

250
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:58,500
I'm getting a meteor shower. Sacrifice. Armageddon. Clone. No, what are we going

251
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:06,599
to do? Fucking meteor shower. Right here. Right here. Right in the middle. I think so.

252
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:26,980
Get free people with it. Oh, boy. You get stronger every day. Come on out here. One hit.

253
00:49:29,739 --> 00:49:42,579
Let's go right here. Is that open yet? This is open, right? We're opening. I can't go

254
00:49:42,579 --> 00:50:01,820
into the moat. Thank you for coming out. Easy. Casual. He's expecting the AI to carry him. No,

255
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:06,940
I'm expecting the AI to get out of the backpack that's on my back.

256
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:16,570
Just weighing me down. He curled up into a ball and he's just in my suitcase.

257
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:31,619
Let's get in here. Done deal. Castle's mine. And then, okay, that's it. I'm going to get

258
00:50:31,619 --> 00:50:41,030
his artifact. Oh, fuck. Ballistics. Two aim shots at max damage or rearrange troops. Two aim shots.

259
00:50:42,170 --> 00:51:08,760
Mine. Okay, good. Now it begins. No. Top left. Here we go. Okay, I don't think I can take

260
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:15,340
this. Yes, I can. Oh, fuck yeah. I'm going to take them both. Pack, pack, few, pack.

261
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:29,559
Defend the capital. I don't even need to defend the capital. It doesn't matter. They're dead

262
00:51:29,559 --> 00:51:46,710
anyways. Pack, pack, few, pack, pack, pack. Just fly. Just cause damage. I'm back. Is

263
00:51:46,710 --> 00:52:01,130
Purple still alive? Yes, but not for long. You need multiple heroes? Yeah, I know. It's

264
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:12,230
just too late for that. I have really nothing. I thought I had multiple heroes when I had a

265
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:29,980
friend of mine playing. I didn't mean to gag myself. This guy doesn't do anything. You

266
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:43,769
may as well just do the chef. Kill the dragon. At least kill one of these dragons. You can do

267
00:52:43,769 --> 00:53:00,900
it. You're so bad. Worst unit in the game. He's getting toxic. It's not even good. It's

268
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:08,260
a bad unit. It's not even a good unit. No, it's the starting... I was the wrong

269
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:13,449
character to start with. This player's not even good. This guy's not even good. I just

270
00:53:13,449 --> 00:53:22,889
picked the wrong starting hero. This guy's not even good. It's really annoying. I should

271
00:53:22,889 --> 00:53:25,289
have fucking won. I picked the wrong fucking hero in the beginning. This guy's not even

272
00:53:25,289 --> 00:53:39,000
good at the game. You don't have a friend like that that you play games with or you

273
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,619
played games with and every time that they died, it was always like... No, this game's

274
00:53:43,619 --> 00:53:58,840
bad. That guy's bad. I am that friend. All right, here we go. Let's go. I need music for

275
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:10,489
this. Good music. Hold on. I gotta get pumped up. No, not Doom. It's gotta be like epic

276
00:54:10,489 --> 00:54:34,300
fantasy music. Not Benny Hill. Does this have a song? It does have a song, doesn't

277
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:38,389
it? All right, I'm gonna be quiet and you're gonna be able to watch the epic

278
00:54:38,389 --> 00:55:58,070
battle, okay? Does Matt just pretend you're watching a movie? Where's that guy from?

279
00:55:58,070 --> 00:56:51,380
Was that guy in the last movie? What's that guy's name? Fuck off! Hello? No, I'm

280
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:59,940
in a movie. Yeah, it's like this fantasy movie. It sucks. Put that phone down! Oh,

281
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:13,690
no, I'll call you back. Fucking dickhead! You threw fucking popcorn at me,

282
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:20,699
motherfucker? What did I do? Sit the fuck down. Fuck out of here, fucking idiot.

283
00:57:21,579 --> 00:57:43,659
Somebody get security! Get away from him! Get him out of here. Get him out of my

284
00:57:43,659 --> 00:57:48,570
fucking mouth. He hit me right in the fucking mouth. Piece of shit. He threw a whole bag of

285
00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:53,940
popcorn at my fucking friend. No, I don't want you to take my name. I don't want you to take

286
00:57:53,940 --> 00:58:03,219
my fucking name. No, you don't need my name. This is like the best part of the movie.

287
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:28,010
I won. I did it! All right, now get my stream not claimed, please. I didn't even

288
00:58:28,010 --> 00:58:41,610
lose anybody, either. Let's go. Have you ever had a girlfriend? Yeah, I got one right

289
00:58:41,610 --> 00:58:53,800
now. We're in Ips camp. Is there an after credit scene? Where am I? Oh, he's coming for the

290
00:58:53,800 --> 00:59:11,739
house. We've rested up. Any replacements? I think we can go down. Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

291
00:59:11,739 --> 00:59:21,690
Unbelievable. I have a girlfriend, but she goes to another school. I mean, that's a classic.

292
00:59:28,059 --> 00:59:30,860
Just I want you to keep in mind something very important. Just look at this.

293
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:35,880
Where was that? Was it down here? You need to see this. This is fucking so important.

294
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:44,170
I'm about to throw a bag of popcorn. Where is he? This purple is just standing and they walk

295
00:59:44,170 --> 01:00:04,519
to buy him. Where is he? There he is. Red walked by him. Isn't it like seven days and

296
01:00:04,519 --> 01:00:31,019
you automatically die of starvation? Why is he still alive? I can't understand.

297
01:00:31,019 --> 01:00:35,500
Your unintelligible Boston accent speak more clearly. Fuck are you talking about?

298
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:44,650
It's another castle. What's that? I'll take another one, please.

299
01:00:45,449 --> 01:01:30,949
What is this music? Oh, it's the castle. Turn off teleport if you do another game. Yeah,

300
01:01:34,099 --> 01:01:45,349
this was the random map. Everything random test. So it's cool. I actually probably

301
01:01:45,349 --> 01:01:48,070
rather play one of the scenarios just because remember when we first started this?

302
01:01:48,869 --> 01:01:53,269
There was random shit everywhere. Almost like as if it wasn't supposed to be where it was.

303
01:01:53,989 --> 01:02:00,969
Well, here we go. I get punched in the face in this movie too.

304
01:02:11,219 --> 01:02:17,989
There we go. I fixed it. Okay, I'm thinking we got eight versus nine. Same dragon,

305
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:30,500
but not anymore. Tell those vampires. I feel like I kind of need to just get in here,

306
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:38,869
but this is my strongest unit. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I have

307
01:02:38,869 --> 01:02:46,809
no idea. I have absolutely no idea. No idea what to do. I get going to get the first hit.

308
01:02:49,239 --> 01:03:11,260
Going in. Fuck it. Get in. Everybody get in. Get in. Is my microphone? No, it's not.

309
01:03:20,309 --> 01:03:29,590
Save the dragons, please. God. No, the dragons can't be saved.

310
01:03:30,230 --> 01:03:36,090
I'm trying to keep the vampires alive. Those are the ones that I think actually really

311
01:03:36,090 --> 01:04:02,860
matter here. Ah, that hurts. Sorrow? Stone skin? Bloodlust? I think so. Save him. You're a

312
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:08,250
heartless owner. He's gonna be fine. I need him to take hits and be able to take out the

313
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:21,099
dragons. He's doing very, very good. Okay, angel. Angel's gonna die here. No, that means

314
01:04:21,099 --> 01:04:28,179
like a super crit. Okay, I had to get rid of them first. Can I make it in here? I don't

315
01:04:28,179 --> 01:04:39,210
think I can. I can't really get over that. Can I walk over this? I have to. She's dead.

316
01:04:39,849 --> 01:05:02,250
Notice people have blood that I can steal. This is game over.

317
01:05:03,610 --> 01:05:06,090
The vampires can't drain any light because there's no light to drain.

318
01:05:07,369 --> 01:05:34,659
No, not yet. It's not a complete lost cause yet. Get in. Get inside. It's unbelievable. All

319
01:05:34,659 --> 01:05:43,900
right. Um, clone, frost ring, anti-magic. I'm thinking what's death ripple? Sends a wave of

320
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:46,539
death across the battlefield, which damage is all non-undead. Everyone's undead here.

321
01:05:47,780 --> 01:06:03,860
Ice bolt. Onto them. Decent. That's decent. I'm gonna beat it. I'm gonna do it, right?

322
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:17,500
Yeah, I am. But what did it cost? What did it cost? We already had one.

323
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:31,460
I just ripped my shirt way more than it was. This is ridiculous now. Now this has to go into

324
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:42,980
like the garbage. Did you guys hear that? This is now like a piece of spaghetti around my neck.

325
01:06:44,389 --> 01:06:55,130
No! It really, I can't like save it either. I just grabbed it like fucking idiot.

326
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:07,179
No, I have to like, I have to stitch, but if I stitch it together, the fibers are going to

327
01:07:07,179 --> 01:07:19,480
be all screwed up. Is this premium? No, this is not a premium. This is not a

328
01:07:20,519 --> 01:07:24,360
$20 premium t-shirt that you can get from the German 95 Teespring store.

329
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:47,780
$20 for a premium shirt. This is just a Hanes. I killed the dragon.

330
01:07:51,539 --> 01:07:56,260
It doesn't matter. I'm like, I'm not going to win this. I'm going to win like this

331
01:07:56,260 --> 01:08:03,719
match, but am I going to look at the fucking units I have. It doesn't matter. It's fine.

332
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:17,560
I'm like, there we go. I got 12,000 experience. Basic learning, basic error. Hey, I did it.

333
01:08:18,779 --> 01:08:26,500
This is my original home. I have five vampires. I took my home back. That's all I care about.

334
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:39,350
And I'm going to go take this one too. Did you make ads for the Teespring so that

335
01:08:39,350 --> 01:08:46,859
you can play it when chat asks for ads? Yeah, that's true. Every time you guys ask

336
01:08:46,859 --> 01:08:53,100
for an ad, I'm just going to tell you about my t-shirt. Holy shit. 37 of these. This is

337
01:08:53,100 --> 01:09:11,380
the real end here. That's too many. Is this the same castle? You'll never take me alive.

338
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:44,300
I'll blow this place to kingdom come before I go with you. What is that? I got to do my last

339
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:51,130
I'm still standing and everyone's watching. They have the respect and they have the

340
01:09:51,130 --> 01:09:56,729
dignity to let me at my own dignity and my own free will go out of the castle

341
01:09:57,369 --> 01:10:23,050
and have my final stand. Purple lived. Purple lived without a house just walking around.

342
01:10:24,170 --> 01:10:30,569
That's the third time I've lost my fucking head. I want to see stats from that game.

343
01:10:30,569 --> 01:10:45,109
Show me stats. I want to see the after the game scores. Bad military leader. Yeah,

344
01:10:45,109 --> 01:10:53,380
it's all right though. Go to the autosave and look at the tavern. What do you mean?

345
01:10:55,029 --> 01:11:11,960
Uh, no. Back, back, back. Autosave and look at the tavern. The tavern where? Uh, what about it?

346
01:11:16,649 --> 01:11:30,439
Oh, you're talking about here. Yeah, he didn't do anything. He got the most wood. I was number of

347
01:11:30,439 --> 01:11:38,170
towns. Goal. I was up here. I would have been up here. He just collected resources and sent

348
01:11:38,170 --> 01:11:45,479
them to me sometimes in the mail. Yeah, I don't have the best hero because my hero's dead.

349
01:11:45,479 --> 01:11:57,340
He just died. See that the game doesn't even think that I have a 10, 3, 6, 9 hero. How about

350
01:11:57,340 --> 01:12:12,090
doing triple time? Second place against the AI. Yeah, this is a hard game. It's a hard game.

351
01:12:12,729 --> 01:12:22,279
Fake wood more than one hero. I had, I had like three or four heroes in the first like four

352
01:12:22,279 --> 01:12:27,979
hours of this campaign. I did. Purple just was in a fucking luggage and I was storing

353
01:12:27,979 --> 01:12:46,119
them overhead all day. I need to worry about my own luggage. Streamer eats four gyros? Oh god,

354
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:52,359
it's not a real Heroes of Might and Magic 3 stream. It's not eight hours. No, I can't

355
01:12:52,359 --> 01:13:09,060
do that today. We're coming back slow during a colon. Here we go. He, he's gonna say it.

356
01:13:09,699 --> 01:13:14,100
He's about to say, he's gonna say it. He's about to say it. No, no, no, don't say,

357
01:13:14,180 --> 01:13:22,899
don't, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't do it. Guys, that's gonna be the...

358
01:13:26,260 --> 01:13:39,770
I paused the stream. Did he say, did he say it? Did he? I paused it. I'm gonna unpause. I hope

359
01:13:39,770 --> 01:14:05,510
he doesn't say it. End of the stream. No! He did it. Don't do that. Nah, yeah, I'm,

360
01:14:05,670 --> 01:14:11,220
I need to ease back into this. I've already been supposed to take it easy today and I,

361
01:14:11,220 --> 01:14:16,520
like, was screaming and yelling. I just can't have a fucking, I can't have, like, a calm stream.

362
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:22,949
I just can't. I don't know what it is. Every time I say, oh, I'm gonna play Shaman

363
01:14:22,949 --> 01:14:32,539
Vax for an episode and then do it, I always end up screaming. Is there a way that I can

364
01:14:32,539 --> 01:14:40,140
just, like, not get high energy? I'm just gonna eat, like, a bunch of pasta before

365
01:14:40,140 --> 01:14:51,579
my next comfy stream so I don't, like, do make any noises. Get a lobotomy. Whoa.

366
01:14:53,560 --> 01:15:00,260
Nah, I'm kidding around. But for real, colonoscopy went well. We cleaned up some stuff. I just kind

367
01:15:00,260 --> 01:15:04,659
of want to have a chill day today and scream and make noises and be very loud and scream some

368
01:15:04,659 --> 01:15:10,550
more. Tomorrow is Cooking Simulator. That's gonna be a fun one. I can't wait. I've been

369
01:15:10,550 --> 01:15:27,300
really looking forward to it. Hope you enjoy it. Tomorrow, regular time, same place, same

370
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:36,229
network. Thank you, everybody, for watching. He hates it. No, no. Have you seen the trailer?

371
01:15:36,789 --> 01:15:43,960
It looks very detailed and very fun. It's like House Flipper but only in the kitchen

372
01:15:44,949 --> 01:15:52,760
and you only cook food. It's very detailed. I think you're gonna like it. But take care

373
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:57,850
of yourselves. We're gonna do the bits and everything. Not quite ready to leave. It's

374
01:15:57,850 --> 01:16:01,770
not like House Flipper at all. Well, I'm just saying it's one of those, like, simulation

375
01:16:01,770 --> 01:16:15,220
kind of... you'll see. You'll see. That's what we're gonna call it. Why is Sam and Max still up?

376
01:16:15,220 --> 01:16:22,810
That was incorrect. But let's do the bits and the subs. If you've taken off, hopefully we see

377
01:16:22,810 --> 01:16:27,399
you soon. Maybe tomorrow or the next day. Normal time tomorrow. We have between three and

378
01:16:27,399 --> 01:16:36,939
four pacific. Hopefully see you there. So let us rewind five hours to the beginning of the

379
01:16:36,939 --> 01:16:42,229
stream. Let's go over some of these bits. What do you say? Am I gonna play Layers of

380
01:16:42,229 --> 01:16:53,939
Fear 2? I don't know. I really don't know. I've seen such wild mixed things about it.

381
01:16:55,020 --> 01:17:01,020
I've heard it's really awful and not in, like, a fun, funny way. Just not fun and not good at all.

382
01:17:01,579 --> 01:17:06,699
And then I've heard, no, it's actually pretty great. It's so mixed. I don't even know

383
01:17:07,420 --> 01:17:15,720
what I want to do. But it seems like it doesn't really have great response so far.

384
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:31,829
What are we talking about? Layers of Fear 2. He hates it. Hey, thank you to Atrolux8trucks

385
01:17:31,829 --> 01:17:38,840
for the 250. They say Pride 100. Pride 100. Pride 50. We fucking love you, Jerma. Those new meds.

386
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:48,579
Huh. You can do this. P.S. Happy Pride Month. Happy Pride Month. Those new meds.

387
01:17:49,460 --> 01:17:54,729
We fucking love you, Jerma. Those new meds. I did get new medication for my,

388
01:17:55,529 --> 01:18:00,939
I was gonna say my bum, but that's what it is. What am I gonna pretend that's not what it is?

389
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,239
Uh, it's, it is a little weird. I'm trying to get used to it.

390
01:18:08,119 --> 01:18:19,060
But we'll see. Thank you so much for the 250. Really appreciate it. Marvosh Magali,

391
01:18:19,060 --> 01:18:23,880
thanks for the 250. Hi, Jerma. I missed quite a lot of streams. The only VOD I watched was

392
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:28,840
the Talk to Transformer one, and that got me in tears. Glad the colonoscopy went good.

393
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:35,319
Did your mum enjoy the tour? Take care. Yes. My mother had a great time here.

394
01:18:36,199 --> 01:18:47,800
When she was here last month. It was a great time. It was great to see my mother. She's

395
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:56,140
wonderful. Hopefully I see her again soon. And yeah, the colonoscopy did, it went well,

396
01:18:56,140 --> 01:19:00,699
from my understanding. There's still tissue that's being examined. I have to wait a few

397
01:19:00,699 --> 01:19:05,739
weeks. That's how long it takes the biopsies to come back. But I was told that there are

398
01:19:05,739 --> 01:19:13,659
no major concerns, but in a few weeks I will know for sure. There's some tissue still

399
01:19:13,659 --> 01:19:24,729
being examined. Colon tour. It's just a long tube. Am I gonna stream E3? Yes. I'm going to do

400
01:19:25,689 --> 01:19:28,250
the same thing that I did last year and do the major conferences.

401
01:19:29,050 --> 01:19:37,510
So you can expect that? Absolutely. But thank you Marvosh Magali. Thank you

402
01:19:37,510 --> 01:19:43,899
Daft Skeletor for the $15. There's no message here, but 15 bucks is a large drop of money.

403
01:19:43,899 --> 01:19:56,220
Thank you. Appreciate the $15. Thank you so much. What were the minor concerns?

404
01:19:57,020 --> 01:20:02,699
Uh, I mean I have irritable bowel disease. I've had like colitis for 15 years almost,

405
01:20:02,699 --> 01:20:09,100
12 years at this point. Since I was like 24, 23. It's been almost like, no it's been like

406
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:23,619
10 years. Something like that. So I still have those problems. It's just I've never had a full

407
01:20:23,619 --> 01:20:30,380
colonoscopy before. I've had sigmoidoscopies, which is the same thing except they don't go

408
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:40,939
as far in. So yeah, there's IBS and there's IBD. IBS is irritable bowel syndrome.

409
01:20:40,939 --> 01:20:45,819
IBD is irritable bowel disease. I will have it for the rest of my life. You cannot get rid of

410
01:20:45,819 --> 01:20:56,859
it. So that's just the way it is. So I have to be a lot more conscious of my intestinal

411
01:20:56,859 --> 01:21:01,140
and gastro health. So that's why a lot of people were asking. I know we talked about

412
01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:06,170
this in the beginning of the stream, but some of you may not have been here. I have to be screened

413
01:21:07,989 --> 01:21:18,539
earlier just because of all the gastro issues that I do have. So and I was having a couple

414
01:21:18,539 --> 01:21:22,220
of symptoms that I didn't really have an explanation for. So we went down the path of

415
01:21:22,220 --> 01:21:28,300
just getting it done now. There you go. But thank you for the $15. Daffskeletor. Thank you

416
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:34,279
C4G for the $5. Jerma, I'm begging you do a dollar on high stream. Maybe when chapter five

417
01:21:34,279 --> 01:21:40,840
comes out on Thursday. No, I can't play those games in front of people because I make like

418
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:45,640
decisions that are so bad probably and aren't like completely correct and everyone would just

419
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:49,399
make fun of me. You try to tell me that if I like had lethal and I missed it,

420
01:21:50,359 --> 01:21:57,079
the chat wouldn't be like making tons of fun of me and stuff. No, I know that I don't

421
01:21:57,079 --> 01:22:06,250
know how to play well. I don't want to be told that. I already know it. I do everything

422
01:22:06,250 --> 01:22:14,420
so incorrectly that you guys would send me to the guillotine if I streamed that game.

423
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:26,939
Talking about Hearthstone. Not only do I miss lethal, but sometimes I do wrong trades and then

424
01:22:26,939 --> 01:22:33,029
I go oops, oh it's okay. I'll just do the spell to him next time. And it's completely

425
01:22:33,029 --> 01:22:44,279
incorrect, but it still works. I'm the kind of person that does like the deal two damage

426
01:22:44,279 --> 01:22:50,279
to an enemy to the hero's face. I do that sometimes. Just people are not going to be

427
01:22:50,279 --> 01:22:58,300
happy about that if I do that on stream. I'm the guy that you go up against in chicken league

428
01:22:58,300 --> 01:23:06,220
rank 25 that the first thing he does is do the two damage hunter spell that costs what one

429
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:13,420
mana to your face and you know immediately you're going to win. Yeah, arcane shot.

430
01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:19,340
I'm the guy that does the arcane shot to you turn one to your face and you are guaranteed

431
01:23:19,340 --> 01:23:27,770
to win that game. So that's why I can't stream. But thank you. I appreciate the enthusiasm on

432
01:23:27,770 --> 01:23:38,170
the way. Thank you C4G. Hey trust no one. Thanks for the $2.50. December 2018 you announced

433
01:23:38,170 --> 01:23:43,640
green screen encore. That was a long time ago. Right after that I got lots of inspiration to

434
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:52,439
produce 10 videos. It's summer already. Jerma lied again, but I still want to share my

435
01:23:52,439 --> 01:23:58,579
works with you. Have you watched them before next stream? Want to bring fun to chat fellas?

436
01:23:58,659 --> 01:24:06,550
Or no. It's always up to you daddy. All right you ready? You ready for this?

437
01:24:07,109 --> 01:24:12,550
Are you ready? You have to hold me to this date. Are you ready? Are you ready for this?

438
01:24:12,550 --> 01:24:15,750
Because I'm gonna make a date. I'm gonna give you a date here and like we have to do it.

439
01:24:21,260 --> 01:24:53,369
It is June 4th 2019. We are going to do a watch the video stream on June 29th.

440
01:24:54,949 --> 01:25:13,260
June 29th. I want to give people time to get them ready. June 29th of 2019. Can't be this week.

441
01:25:13,260 --> 01:25:18,699
Can't be next week. I got like the E3 stuff is this weekend. I've got these like unlock

442
01:25:18,699 --> 01:25:28,090
escape the room card things that I want to do on cam and then like the the week of the

443
01:25:29,289 --> 01:25:35,380
like the 17th I've got something. You can clip it. Don't let me forget.

444
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:39,699
And I will give you some details about that. I want to give like a couple weeks so I can

445
01:25:40,420 --> 01:25:47,720
get the some of the mods involved so we can actually set up something like last time.

446
01:25:52,090 --> 01:25:55,930
This is not a re-watching of this would be new videos. Videos that were not

447
01:25:55,930 --> 01:26:03,180
on the last stream and I may even if we I don't know maybe we just turn maybe we'll

448
01:26:03,180 --> 01:26:10,180
just turn it into like uh I don't know let me think about this. Let me let me think

449
01:26:10,180 --> 01:26:21,619
about this because I've got some ideas. Maybe they might not all have to be green screen

450
01:26:21,619 --> 01:26:26,819
videos. You know what I'm saying? If we might maybe we could do something here

451
01:26:27,380 --> 01:26:36,260
because people make lots of great videos that aren't necessarily only about green screen stuff.

452
01:26:36,979 --> 01:26:43,180
I mean obviously they'd have to follow some criteria where it'd have to do with the channel.

453
01:26:43,739 --> 01:26:49,779
Like you could don't just don't just like send me like a video of like Shrek playing

454
01:26:49,779 --> 01:26:52,659
like the flute or something like what that means not what does that have to do with anything.

455
01:26:56,920 --> 01:27:00,039
Well I'll figure that out. I'll start talking to some of the mods about it.

456
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:10,090
June 29th will be the day we do it. Arrest that guy. Now it has to happen. There you go.

457
01:27:12,119 --> 01:27:16,020
And we could turn we could make it uh we can we might be able to make it interesting too.

458
01:27:16,579 --> 01:27:20,020
Not that the last one wasn't interesting but maybe add a couple of things.

459
01:27:20,739 --> 01:27:26,260
Maybe put some incentives. Maybe do like a charity thing. I don't know maybe. Let

460
01:27:26,260 --> 01:27:44,220
let me just explore this. I'll explore this for a little bit. 29 guest stars. We'll see.

461
01:27:44,859 --> 01:27:50,039
But I have not forgotten it's just kind of a lot of random shit has happened.

462
01:27:50,939 --> 01:27:56,220
A bunch of people have visited here. I've had like friends and family and medical. Like

463
01:27:56,220 --> 01:27:59,260
there's just been things that have been happening that I just can't really focus on

464
01:28:01,590 --> 01:28:06,680
any of the projects that I want to focus on immediately. There's been a lot of just like

465
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:14,279
guests strangely enough. Some unexpected. But yeah it's that's just the way it is.

466
01:28:15,819 --> 01:28:20,060
We're gonna push forward. But thank you trust no one. Look forward to seeing your videos.

467
01:28:22,659 --> 01:28:27,619
Hey cornflex. Thanks for the 15 dollars cornflex. Hey German just quit my job and I

468
01:28:27,619 --> 01:28:31,140
feel fly but I hope you're doing good. Here's a bit of snack money. Keep doing

469
01:28:31,140 --> 01:28:35,539
you. I will buy snacks with those. I will buy 15 dollars worth of snacks I promise.

470
01:28:39,779 --> 01:28:49,770
Uh quit your job. Hopefully you can figure out what to do next. Wish you the best of luck.

471
01:28:49,770 --> 01:28:56,439
What do you mean I'm not gonna buy snacks with that. Guys like 45 percent of my whole income

472
01:28:56,439 --> 01:29:05,189
goes to snacks. Like this is six pantries here. I can't stop. I eat like two bags of chips

473
01:29:05,189 --> 01:29:15,819
every day. I can't stop. I eat a loaf of bread every fucking morning. I just soak the

474
01:29:15,819 --> 01:29:27,930
bread in water and then like. I do not do that. But thank you for the 15 dollars cornflex.

475
01:29:29,210 --> 01:29:36,149
I'm doing pretty good. Thank you for the snack money. After schmaff. After schmaff. Thanks for

476
01:29:36,149 --> 01:29:40,149
the three bucks. I love everything you do. You're my favorite content creator by far.

477
01:29:40,149 --> 01:29:43,670
Haven't caught a stream in a while because of emotional problems. So I'm glad to see

478
01:29:43,670 --> 01:29:47,350
nothing's changed. Here's all the rest of my bits because you deserve it. I also wanted

479
01:29:47,430 --> 01:29:56,279
ask you are you going to stream cyberpunk 2077? Okay well soon. Yes. I feel like you have to.

480
01:29:57,960 --> 01:30:06,090
That game is just looks like it's so full of stuff to do. Whenever that comes out whatever

481
01:30:06,090 --> 01:30:13,579
the criteria is for its release I feel like everyone. There's gonna be a day on twitch

482
01:30:14,539 --> 01:30:20,220
where when you go to the browse by game category there's probably gonna be like

483
01:30:20,300 --> 01:30:26,619
six games on that list and there'll be like fucking 40,000 people streaming 2077

484
01:30:27,500 --> 01:30:38,310
and then like Hearthstone, League of Legends, and CSGO. Everyone's gonna play this game. So

485
01:30:38,310 --> 01:31:04,949
I'll be one of them. 2077. Yeah 2077. 2077. Normie. Come on. Normie stream? What?

486
01:31:05,670 --> 01:31:15,899
We just played like Heroes of Might and Magic 3. Why is cyberpunk 2077? What are you talking about?

487
01:31:19,060 --> 01:31:22,739
Heroes of Might and Magic is so normie. What do you mean normie? What does that even mean?

488
01:31:23,539 --> 01:31:41,060
What does that even mean? That's pretty normal. Heroes of Might and Magic is the most played

489
01:31:41,060 --> 01:31:51,260
game of all time. Oh yeah? How many hours do you guys have in it? I bet I see a lot of

490
01:31:51,260 --> 01:32:02,199
zeros. Two because it blue screens my computer. I'm sorry to hear that that's not cool.

491
01:32:03,159 --> 01:32:13,210
Zero because I'm not a normie. I feel like if uh if you guys like watched me eat like frosted

492
01:32:13,210 --> 01:32:22,869
flakes I'd be like a normie cereal. Right? What is not a normie cereal? What is not what is not

493
01:32:22,869 --> 01:32:30,920
normie in like the cereal world? Brute Loops? No that's normie. Raisin Bran? That's normie.

494
01:32:32,300 --> 01:32:40,220
Nothing. Everything is normie. Don't you understand? Honey Bunches of Oats? That's

495
01:32:40,220 --> 01:32:48,819
not what are you talking about? That's very normal. Apple Jackson for Chad's?

496
01:32:52,869 --> 01:33:05,670
Apple what? Honey Bunches of Oats? No. Bacon Flakes? Cookie Crisp? No that's bullshit.

497
01:33:05,670 --> 01:33:10,380
Cookie Crisp before the recipe change. Maybe I would agree with you but they changed that

498
01:33:10,380 --> 01:33:26,470
recipe. It doesn't taste the same. Fruity Pebbles? No I don't I disagree. Fruity Pebbles

499
01:33:26,470 --> 01:33:34,060
you pour the milk in and before you put the spoon in to bite into the cereal it turns into wet

500
01:33:34,060 --> 01:33:59,930
napkins. I disagree. Count Chocula. Now that I can get behind. I can get behind that. Anyways

501
01:33:59,930 --> 01:34:15,300
what? I think Pops is a pretty... I think I could get behind that too. Or uh Smacks. When

502
01:34:15,300 --> 01:34:25,319
was the last time you had Smacks? That's what it's called right? With the frog? Yeah Honey

503
01:34:25,319 --> 01:34:34,600
Smacks. Honey Smacks. Those were awesome. I can get behind those. Those are the ones that looked

504
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:41,000
like coffee beans. They were little coffee beans puffed up. I might just go buy some.

505
01:34:42,739 --> 01:34:46,260
I'm just gonna prove how much of a not of a normie I am. I'm gonna just eat Honey Smacks.

506
01:34:46,979 --> 01:35:01,579
What are you linking me here? Kissed. I don't even know what that is. Cereal Unboxing. All

507
01:35:01,579 --> 01:35:09,399
right let's keep going. Thank you Dr. Low Note for the five dollars. Pogchamp. Pogchamp. Pogchamp

508
01:35:09,399 --> 01:35:16,600
Pogchamp had my LSAT yesterday. Glad you're back. I hope you're feeling good. Feeling pretty good.

509
01:35:17,239 --> 01:35:30,460
Hopefully you did well on the LSAT. That's a Pogchamp yeah. Thank you for the five dollars

510
01:35:30,460 --> 01:35:41,529
Dr. Low Note and hope you did good. Dorkcube7000 thanks for the 250. Now

511
01:35:42,409 --> 01:35:46,329
when you went to get your colonoscopy you made sure to show the doc your fire watch photos

512
01:35:46,329 --> 01:36:00,949
right? Doctor didn't need to see fire watch photos. He saw way more than that. Fire watch

513
01:36:00,949 --> 01:36:09,609
photos don't even compare to the images. I have these images by the way. I was thinking about

514
01:36:11,130 --> 01:36:18,840
they give them to you. It's a bunch of images but I don't think I can show them.

515
01:36:20,409 --> 01:36:23,770
I'm fairly certain that that's like I don't know I think that might break TOS.

516
01:36:27,260 --> 01:36:36,710
Autograph them. Post them on Twitter. I can't do that. Can't you get it? I can't do that.

517
01:36:38,579 --> 01:36:45,060
Autograph? No it's like bad. There's like inflammation and stuff. You don't want to see

518
01:36:45,060 --> 01:36:57,850
these but I already have new fire watch photos that the doctor took for me up my ass. That's

519
01:36:57,850 --> 01:37:05,939
the fucking like comedy there. Put them on discord. No I'm not gonna like I'm not gonna

520
01:37:05,939 --> 01:37:20,710
like fucking sign and show and sell my colonoscopy photos. That's like fucking

521
01:37:20,710 --> 01:37:28,279
apocalyptic like dystopian world. Me selling photos of my colonoscopy. Me signing and

522
01:37:28,279 --> 01:37:44,199
sending them to people. Welcome to 2020. What the fuck. But anyways yes thank you for

523
01:37:44,199 --> 01:37:49,479
the 250 door cube. Thank you Devakitty for the four dollars and 25 cents. Happy pride month.

524
01:37:49,479 --> 01:37:52,920
Take the rest of my bits in memory of the people like Marsha P who fought so hard for civil

525
01:37:52,920 --> 01:38:00,619
liberty. Lesbian pride. Transgender pride. Happy pride month. Thank you so much for the four

526
01:38:00,619 --> 01:38:10,810
dollars and 25 cents. Dr Oz did it and he's a doctor. Dr Oz also had a fucking tv show

527
01:38:10,810 --> 01:38:21,850
where he was a doctor on tv. I'm not a fucking doctor on stream. I'm not Dr Oz. I don't go

528
01:38:21,850 --> 01:38:28,779
on tv and talk about my stuff. Let me tell you something. I went to the store and I got

529
01:38:29,500 --> 01:38:41,510
some lentils. I do a pretty good doctor, don't I? That's what he talks like. That's what he

530
01:38:41,510 --> 01:38:55,460
talks like. Why are you comparing me to Dr Oz? That wasn't Bernie. That was that was Dr Oz.

531
01:38:56,100 --> 01:39:01,689
Hello everybody and welcome to the Dr Oz show. I'm gonna fucking prove this right now.

532
01:39:03,930 --> 01:39:08,970
Today I have a very important thing talked about on the show and that's colonoscopy.

533
01:39:09,050 --> 01:39:26,869
At Dr Oz, I want to talk. Listen to me. You ready? I can't wait to prove everybody here wrong.

534
01:39:26,869 --> 01:39:44,869
It feels so good. Hi Dr Oz here. Welcome to my official youtube channel. Hey Dr Oz here. Welcome

questions that I don't get to discuss. Your health questions that I don't get to discuss on

542
01:40:17,670 --> 01:40:29,859
the show. To submit yours. Come on guys. Give me a break. Update my Facebook. No,

543
01:40:29,859 --> 01:40:35,159
I'm gonna delete that Facebook. I'm gonna push the red button on that thing.

544
01:40:45,029 --> 01:40:52,069
What's the next big thing that's gonna come along? Is it TikTok? I feel like that already

545
01:40:52,069 --> 01:41:01,739
happened. Did TikTok take our children away from Facebook? Or is it Discord that took our

546
01:41:01,739 --> 01:41:15,590
children away from Facebook? What's the second internet? I missed TikTok's birth and death.

547
01:41:16,310 --> 01:41:23,739
I, yeah, I, I thought I, when I always thought of TikTok, I thought TikTok was

548
01:41:23,739 --> 01:41:31,960
Vine. But then I was shown videos of what TikTok is. And it's people, people lip-syncing

549
01:41:32,520 --> 01:41:43,430
for like eight seconds. And that's it. It's like Vine, but you lip-sync for like eight seconds.

550
01:41:50,569 --> 01:42:03,460
It's just, it's a shittier Vine for Gen Z. It's Evil Vine. Evil, Evil Vine.

551
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:13,939
Why does that sound so funny? Vine was Gen Zoomer though. Well, why did they need another

552
01:42:13,939 --> 01:42:21,720
one? Oh, it's because they deleted Vine. That's right. They deleted Vine and then Vine,

553
01:42:21,720 --> 01:42:33,899
then TikTok took all the Vine kids, right? Oh, fuck. All I remember from TikTok is people

554
01:42:33,899 --> 01:42:41,829
sending me videos of everybody having like vampire teeth. I swear, I think I have been shown

555
01:42:42,470 --> 01:42:53,029
10 or 12 TikTok videos. And I think eight of them, they had vampire teeth. I'm just,

556
01:42:53,029 --> 01:43:10,180
I'm just telling you just anecdotal things. Zoomers can't stay with something for more

557
01:43:10,180 --> 01:43:21,750
than a couple of months. It's because they're fucking always moving. Vampires are normie.

558
01:43:21,750 --> 01:43:28,310
Their brains are too small. What the fuck? Why? That's not, hey, wow.

559
01:43:30,680 --> 01:43:34,760
We found the boomer. We found the boomer. I, you guys call me boomer.

560
01:43:35,560 --> 01:43:41,930
Zoomers, yeah, sure. Their brains are all so small. All they do is drink fucking

561
01:43:42,010 --> 01:43:47,930
Mountain Dew, game fuel, and floss and watch TikTok. That actually, is that what you do?

562
01:43:48,489 --> 01:44:04,939
Is that what, that's what actually happens? Kind of. No, I'm talking about teeth. Like they

563
01:44:04,939 --> 01:44:09,180
floss their teeth. Boomers don't floss their teeth. Neither do millennials. Zoomers are flossing

564
01:44:09,180 --> 01:44:21,100
their teeth. That's one thing you got to remember. That's important. Mine is too beyond

565
01:44:21,100 --> 01:44:29,619
that. That was funny. Anyways, thank you The Yellowist for the $5. Thank you, Yellowist.

566
01:44:30,260 --> 01:44:35,220
Hey, Germo. There was a huge gap around 2016 where I couldn't find you in YouTube and didn't

567
01:44:35,220 --> 01:44:40,180
know you made the jump to Twitch. So there was a ton of old content I missed, but I found them

568
01:44:40,180 --> 01:44:44,899
recently. Just the streams in their entirety. So I'm going to get watching. PSU Sorcerer

569
01:44:44,899 --> 01:44:51,300
streams were amazing. You got a lot, you got a lot of stuff to watch. Because unlike YouTube,

570
01:44:51,300 --> 01:45:01,779
which was, you know, six to 12 minute videos, there are lots of five to 10 hour long streams.

571
01:45:02,500 --> 01:45:07,699
You have hundreds of potential, hundreds of hours of stuff to go through. And you're going

572
01:45:07,699 --> 01:45:12,579
to see some of the best fucking content you've seen in a decade. You thought Auto's Big Adventure

573
01:45:12,579 --> 01:45:18,899
was good? Just wait till you see The Sims 4. You thought that GTA 4, One Day I'll Die

574
01:45:18,899 --> 01:45:22,420
From Laughter, you think that was a good video? Just wait until you see the family dinner stream.

575
01:45:22,420 --> 01:45:29,989
You thought, in your head, in your own mind, you thought that Breakfast with Doofus and Goofus

576
01:45:29,989 --> 01:45:34,789
was a good video? Just wait until you get to the video content live demand of me playing

577
01:45:34,789 --> 01:45:43,079
with the Nintendo Labo. I don't want to spoil anything for you, but you've got some good

578
01:45:43,079 --> 01:45:58,340
things to catch up on. Maybe skip that one. No. No skip. But thank you, Yellowist. Welcome

579
01:45:58,340 --> 01:46:06,340
back. Glad you could find me again. Don't watch the Skate 3 one, though. You'll come

580
01:46:06,340 --> 01:46:15,060
across it and then like think I'm a bad person. Daft Skeletor. $30. No message,

581
01:46:15,060 --> 01:46:18,579
but just a lot of money tonight and community subs. Thank you, Daft Skeletor

582
01:46:19,300 --> 01:46:27,699
for your large, large amounts of money and your community subs. High, high contributions.

583
01:46:27,699 --> 01:46:37,109
Thank you. It means a lot. And we had Atomic Fox for $15. Thank you, Atomic Fox for the

584
01:46:37,109 --> 01:46:43,430
15 bucks. They say Pride. Jerma, happy Pride from a big gay. Been watching you a long time.

585
01:46:43,430 --> 01:46:49,529
I don't have a lot of money, but I hope this is something. Gay Rides. Happy Pride Month.

586
01:46:50,170 --> 01:46:56,409
Thank you so much for the $15. And you've been watching for a long time.

587
01:46:57,689 --> 01:47:18,979
Thanks a lot. From a big gay. Thank you. $15. Big Gay Al. I forgot about Big Gay Al.

588
01:47:20,979 --> 01:47:25,220
Jerma lied about the Clown Car. 5 community subs. Adventure MF Dan. 5 community subs.

589
01:47:29,189 --> 01:47:36,100
Thank you. There were a lot of 5 drops tonight for community subs. You guys are awesome.

590
01:47:36,819 --> 01:47:44,060
Thank you. Thank you Trampston for the $5. Local little man gets wallowed by his own

591
01:47:44,060 --> 01:47:52,229
colon on stream in a fit of rage. Were you meant to say swallowed? Thank you for the $5.

592
01:47:53,189 --> 01:48:03,289
Jerma lied about 5k subs. Thanks for the $2.60. Thanks a lot. Thanks for the $2.60.

593
01:48:05,050 --> 01:48:13,720
I didn't lie. I just said I'm not doing it. That's not a lie. That's just me saying no.

594
01:48:13,720 --> 01:48:18,439
I'm not going to do it. I mean is it a lie? No. Go back and watch it and get the whole

595
01:48:18,439 --> 01:48:23,850
context there. Thank you Night Team for the $10 Night Team. I was excited to play Clone

596
01:48:23,850 --> 01:48:29,130
Heroes today but the adapter that came today didn't work. So I have to wait 10 plus more days

597
01:48:29,130 --> 01:48:42,789
for a new one. 10 days? In 2019? What's up with that? Glad you came back to stream.

598
01:48:43,350 --> 01:48:48,470
Glad you came to stream to a now not so disappointing day. Hope you get better soon

599
01:48:48,470 --> 01:48:58,220
Jerma Hart. Thank you. Thanks for the $10. And I'm doing pretty good. I'm still a little

600
01:48:58,939 --> 01:49:09,399
crampy. I'll be fine. I'll be good. Thanks for the $10 Night Team. A wild Meryl thanks

601
01:49:09,399 --> 01:49:16,039
for the $15. Just show love. Show love, show love, show love. Thanks for the 15 bucks.

602
01:49:16,680 --> 01:49:27,180
No message. Thank you so much. A wild Meryl. Meryl. Thank you. Freudian Weapon thanks for

603
01:49:27,180 --> 01:49:32,119
the $2.50 Freudian. Hey Jerma. Glad to hear everything went well. Good to have you back.

604
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:35,880
Try not to over exert yourself too much. It could be a real pain in the ass.

605
01:49:36,520 --> 01:49:47,909
Sorry bad joke. Please don't ban me. Ban that guy. Thank you for the $2.50. Appreciate it.

606
01:49:47,909 --> 01:49:55,029
Abomination Zero thanks for the $5. I was having a really really rough night but you

607
01:49:55,029 --> 01:49:57,989
made it a lot better. Glad you could stream. Love you man. Thank you.

608
01:50:02,859 --> 01:50:06,140
Sorry to hear you're not having a good night. Hopefully it gets better.

609
01:50:08,359 --> 01:50:15,140
Thank you so much for the $5 and I really hope that you night really turns around. Thank you

610
01:50:15,140 --> 01:50:28,409
Abomination Zero for the $5. Coconut Sales EO thanks for the $2.65. Hey Jerma. Worry not.

611
01:50:28,409 --> 01:50:33,210
One more inch sir. I've bought one of your shirts. Thanks for the opportunity to buy one.

612
01:50:33,210 --> 01:50:38,010
I just wanted to say after purchasing it I'm thoroughly impressed. Impressed sorry I meant

613
01:50:38,010 --> 01:50:45,939
depressed. I used to be happy. Well you don't have the shirt yet so hopefully when

614
01:50:45,939 --> 01:50:52,699
it gets there you'll be very happy about your purchase. Thank you for the $2.65. If

615
01:50:52,699 --> 01:50:57,739
you bought a shirt I hope you love it because they are high quality. Very very competitively

616
01:50:57,739 --> 01:51:07,210
priced but very good. You're gonna love it. But thank you. Hey Vilemi thanks for the $25.

617
01:51:07,930 --> 01:51:14,279
$25 from Vilemi. Hey Jerma now that you're done with the colonoscopy you can finally

618
01:51:14,279 --> 01:51:17,880
get back to chugging Mountain Dew like the gamer god that you are. Here's some bits so

619
01:51:17,880 --> 01:51:27,270
you can stock up on that gamer brew I know you're craving. No I'm not gonna drink that

620
01:51:27,270 --> 01:51:34,680
shit. Thank you for the $25 Vilemi. But I mean technically I probably could drink it but I'm

621
01:51:34,680 --> 01:51:47,180
not going to. Hey FlyingPixels thanks for the $15.02. Much love to you and chat. Y'all are

622
01:51:47,180 --> 01:51:57,560
awesome. I agree. Thanks for the $15 and yeah we got a pretty good chat here. We have some

623
01:51:57,560 --> 01:52:09,779
pretty fun people here. Asana Genova thanks for the $3. I know it doesn't really fit with

624
01:52:09,779 --> 01:52:13,939
the thematic of the channel but I made this hypothetical germ of room emote. Hope you like

625
01:52:13,939 --> 01:52:31,689
it. It looks like a like a video game like go kart character. He's so cute. It's like the

626
01:52:32,329 --> 01:52:40,020
Baron. I really appreciate it. Unfortunately there already is a germ of room emote that

627
01:52:40,020 --> 01:52:46,630
is going to be coming very soon. Thank you so much for that though. It's very cute. It's

628
01:52:46,630 --> 01:52:56,420
very nice. We actually have a lot of things coming. Bloor Dau is currently very hard at

629
01:52:56,420 --> 01:53:02,819
work making a lot of new shit. There's going to be like five to ten new emotes. There's going

630
01:53:02,819 --> 01:53:06,340
to be a bunch of new music. There's going to be a bunch of new stuff. Some new screens,

631
01:53:06,340 --> 01:53:12,520
new animations. It's coming out. Bloor Dau is currently in the process of doing it now.

632
01:53:13,859 --> 01:53:17,539
New music. Oh yeah there's going to be like 10 to 15 new tracks. I'm not making that up.

633
01:53:17,539 --> 01:53:20,500
That's real. Jerma did not lie about Bloor Dau making 15 new music tracks.

634
01:53:21,300 --> 01:53:32,170
I did just say 15 but it's like 10 maybe 12 maybe. It's going to be good stuff. But

635
01:53:32,170 --> 01:53:41,460
thank you Sun of Genova. That's a very very cute emote. I love the scarf. Why don't we get a

636
01:53:41,460 --> 01:53:56,939
Jerma popcorn? Like dog popcorn? Let's get the subs on the screen. Thank you everybody for

637
01:53:56,939 --> 01:54:06,439
your subs. Here come the credits. We were actually, me and Bloor Dau were actually

638
01:54:06,439 --> 01:54:13,380
talking about this. About how to change the credits a little bit maybe. Make them some

639
01:54:13,380 --> 01:54:19,670
maybe more interesting. Change them up so it's not just a scrolling text. We might try to do

640
01:54:19,670 --> 01:54:28,090
something with it. Should be fun. See if it's something we can do. But these are all subs

641
01:54:28,090 --> 01:54:34,460
and wow there's a lot. There's a lot of reason. I guess I haven't been around for like four

642
01:54:34,460 --> 01:54:45,989
days huh? Thanks everybody. Thank you. I know that you know some of you guys only have

643
01:54:45,989 --> 01:54:50,229
like a few subscriptions. Some of you guys only have one sub that you do. Whether it's

644
01:54:50,229 --> 01:54:57,289
like Prime or just a regular sub. And a lot of you guys have been subbed for a

645
01:54:58,250 --> 01:55:06,569
just concurrently for a long long fucking time. So thank you for choosing me. If you do,

646
01:55:09,399 --> 01:55:16,979
thank you. Because there are a lot of other people that stream on this platform so

647
01:55:17,960 --> 01:55:28,020
I'm honored to have the people that sub to this channel sub. Thank you. We have a

648
01:55:28,020 --> 01:55:38,180
couple more bits to do. We have five dollars from iCain, iCainling, iCain. I'm just gonna call you

649
01:55:38,180 --> 01:55:47,189
iCain. My brain is having trouble. You can propose- I don't want to see spoilers. I don't

650
01:55:47,189 --> 01:55:52,149
want to see season three spoilers for Sam and Max. I don't want to see spoilers for Sam and

651
01:55:52,149 --> 01:56:03,430
Max season three. They say Max is extremely hot and if any of you disagree you're lying to

652
01:56:03,510 --> 01:56:23,140
yourself. I'm just gonna fucking Homer Simpson into the bush. Because I don't- I can't- Thank

653
01:56:23,140 --> 01:56:33,189
you for the five dollars. Dragon breath 75 thanks for the 250. Hey Jerma, I wanted to bring up

654
01:56:33,189 --> 01:56:36,710
something about what it was like for me on the anesthetic. Reminder, I'm the guy that was

655
01:56:36,710 --> 01:56:40,550
blabbering your name after my wisdom teeth removal. I do remember that video. It was very

656
01:56:40,550 --> 01:56:45,670
funny. While I was out of it, I swear I had a dual personality experience. The voice in my

657
01:56:45,670 --> 01:56:50,550
head sounded like me talking normal and I was yelling at myself to say normal things but

658
01:56:50,550 --> 01:56:53,430
nothing came out right. Did you have any experience like that with your colonoscopy?

659
01:56:54,550 --> 01:56:59,189
No I was completely- I was completely aware of all the things that I was saying and doing.

660
01:57:00,310 --> 01:57:07,930
I have had that experience before on a different anesthesia where before getting

661
01:57:07,930 --> 01:57:13,449
the IV, I remember saying to myself, oh I really hope I don't say anything stupid or

662
01:57:13,449 --> 01:57:16,489
funny. Don't say anything dumb. Don't say anything funny. Don't say anything stupid.

663
01:57:17,449 --> 01:57:23,369
And as I was getting the medicine and I started to kind of go out, I said to the person that was

664
01:57:24,010 --> 01:57:29,050
administering it, hey do people say anything funny on this? And they told me to stop talking.

665
01:57:29,050 --> 01:57:42,949
They were like stop talking, stop. Your brain's weird. It does just strange things. Yeah I was

666
01:57:42,949 --> 01:57:48,010
told to stop. I was actually told to shut up by the person that was doing it because I was

667
01:57:48,010 --> 01:57:53,289
just so- I was floating out of existence and the one thing that I thought to say was,

668
01:57:53,369 --> 01:57:58,489
hey do people ever say anything funny on this? Because I was over and over again telling my brain

669
01:57:58,489 --> 01:58:04,090
not to say anything funny. So I was trying to pretend to be completely with it for some reason.

670
01:58:04,729 --> 01:58:07,689
Like hey do people ever say anything funny on this? Because I'm not going to say anything

671
01:58:07,689 --> 01:58:15,989
funny because I just told myself not to say anything funny. It probably came out really

672
01:58:15,989 --> 01:58:20,869
fucked up. Yeah it was probably really embarrassing and so was me telling the nurse

673
01:58:20,869 --> 01:58:23,909
that this is not my first rodeo when I'm trying to put my shoes on and almost put

674
01:58:23,909 --> 01:58:31,859
my head through the drywall. Brain altering, brain chemistry altering drugs, hard drugs like that,

675
01:58:31,859 --> 01:58:39,930
just fucking turn you upside down. You didn't hear that part? I told the story at the beginning

676
01:58:39,930 --> 01:58:47,060
of the stream. But I remember everything. I remember waking up. The last thing I remember,

677
01:58:47,060 --> 01:58:51,460
I remember on my side, because you have to lie on your side when they do the colonoscopy,

678
01:58:52,180 --> 01:58:57,140
and the guy said, hey you're gonna feel like a sting in your arm. It's pretty,

679
01:58:57,140 --> 01:59:00,899
it's normal. That's what happens right before and I felt a little sting and then I woke up.

680
01:59:02,890 --> 01:59:12,039
So but when I woke up I was completely aware. It's not like oh I have no idea about anything

681
01:59:12,039 --> 01:59:16,920
I said. I was completely aware of where I was and what I was saying, but I was still saying

682
01:59:16,920 --> 01:59:25,579
fucking dumb shit. And the nurse came in and was talking to me and I kept on talking about

683
01:59:25,579 --> 01:59:31,020
how great of a practice it was. And you guys are all pros. You guys are all pros. You guys

684
01:59:31,020 --> 01:59:38,149
are pros. Let me tell you. I may have, I don't, I have this weird half memory of saying this.

685
01:59:38,149 --> 01:59:41,909
I might not have, but maybe I did. That I was going to give like a Yelp review.

686
01:59:44,649 --> 01:59:56,300
Can you even give a Yelp review for a hospital? Is that even possible? I guess,

687
01:59:56,300 --> 02:00:05,960
yeah, I guess it is. The cafeteria. I give review for like getting like surgery and it's

688
02:00:05,960 --> 02:00:13,420
like the cafeteria in the hospital. Everyone there was a pro. The colonoscopy was fantastic.

689
02:00:14,060 --> 02:00:17,659
The doctors were so nice. The nurse when they were doing the IV and it's like,

690
02:00:18,380 --> 02:00:23,100
uh dude, how was like the, how was the fucking toast? What are you talking about?

691
02:00:26,199 --> 02:00:28,920
But yeah, I almost fell down like three times putting my shoes on.

692
02:00:29,399 --> 02:00:35,079
I was trying so hard to be normal. That's the worst part because you know you're so fucked up.

693
02:00:35,079 --> 02:00:40,220
You know you're on hard drugs and you are so desperate to be normal. You're doing,

694
02:00:40,220 --> 02:00:45,880
you're trying so hard that you try too hard and you do something stupid. And then in

695
02:00:45,880 --> 02:00:50,279
your brain you go, a normal person wouldn't do what I just did. I have to correct this.

696
02:00:51,159 --> 02:00:55,399
Hey, don't worry. This ain't my first rodeo. I have to correct that. And I,

697
02:00:55,399 --> 02:01:07,020
normal people don't say that either. You completely go over what a normal person does.

698
02:01:11,130 --> 02:01:17,399
But the thing is I was, that was not incorrect. This ain't my first rodeo. I've had two

699
02:01:18,359 --> 02:01:23,460
sigmoidoscopies. So maybe my brain was saying like, no, no, it's fine. I've had this done

700
02:01:23,460 --> 02:01:29,420
like before. Or the nurse probably thought I was talking about how I do drugs all the time.

701
02:01:33,380 --> 02:01:38,460
Right? Like we talked about in the beginning of the stream. Sir, sir, sir, please sit down.

702
02:01:38,460 --> 02:01:48,279
Please. No, no, this ain't my first rodeo. I do drugs every day. Oh, oh, okay. They have

703
02:01:48,840 --> 02:02:02,619
both of those scenarios work. Yeah. But yes, Dragon Breath, that is, drugs are fucking

704
02:02:02,619 --> 02:02:11,050
ridiculous. I don't do them. I don't like doing them. Rock Esper, thanks for the 250.

705
02:02:11,050 --> 02:02:15,529
Random question, but I've just been curious. Many streams back, you mentioned listening to

706
02:02:15,529 --> 02:02:20,250
the Lost Odyssey OST in your car. Do you like that game? Because it's one of my all-time

707
02:02:20,250 --> 02:02:29,399
favorites. Also, you're cute. Yes. I told you, yeah, I did tell that story about how

708
02:02:30,279 --> 02:02:35,560
I had some like people that I worked with. There were some acquaintances that were in

709
02:02:35,560 --> 02:02:39,560
my car and I was driving people home and stuff. And I was playing that. And they

710
02:02:39,560 --> 02:02:48,020
thought I was fucking crazy. Lost Odyssey OST. Remember, this is more than, this is like 15

711
02:02:48,020 --> 02:02:58,810
years ago. Can you think of anyone in your entire life that would have the Lost Odyssey

712
02:02:58,810 --> 02:03:11,579
OST in their car in the CD player? Besides me and besides you. That's why it was so

713
02:03:11,579 --> 02:03:16,619
embarrassing because it's just like, I don't know, maybe like part of it was trying to

714
02:03:16,619 --> 02:03:21,430
seem like interesting or something. Hey, what music is, what are you gonna put on? Oh,

715
02:03:21,430 --> 02:03:26,140
put this on, I guess. Look at how interesting I am. Oh, you're listening to like

716
02:03:26,859 --> 02:03:33,989
classical music. No, it's video game music. Oh, look at how interesting you are. Yeah,

717
02:03:33,989 --> 02:03:44,100
I am. Maybe part of me like thought that was what I was doing. I listened to OST. Yeah,

718
02:03:44,100 --> 02:03:50,199
well, not 2019. This is a different time. Back in like, back in like 2003,

719
02:03:52,010 --> 02:03:55,369
there wasn't like Overwatch costumes at the spirit of Halloween stores.

720
02:03:55,930 --> 02:04:01,909
You know what I'm saying? This is like before, this is before games were like cool.

721
02:04:02,550 --> 02:04:14,010
This is back in the day where video games were still kind of like video games.

722
02:04:15,750 --> 02:04:25,850
Well, what's a PC gaming? I've heard of that. So like listening to like a video game OST in

723
02:04:25,850 --> 02:04:30,970
your car now is like, oh, whatever. But in 15 years ago, it was kind of like, why are

724
02:04:30,970 --> 02:04:49,880
you doing this? Back in my day, we had put you know, 15, not 50, 15. But did you Oh,

725
02:04:49,880 --> 02:04:55,239
yeah, let me answer the question. Did you like the game? Oh, yeah, I did. I liked the

726
02:04:55,239 --> 02:05:01,539
combat system in that game. I thought it was engaging. It wasn't just put cursor on this

727
02:05:01,539 --> 02:05:10,489
person and let them get hit. I liked the timed hits. I'm a huge fan of Super Mario RPG and in a

728
02:05:10,489 --> 02:05:15,369
traditional turn based RPG that gives you some kind of control. I like better than just putting

729
02:05:15,369 --> 02:05:21,819
a cursor on somebody. timed hits are more fun for me because it engages me in the game.

730
02:05:24,810 --> 02:05:28,680
Yeah, I thought it was good. I was sad to see that they weren't going to do anything more

731
02:05:28,680 --> 02:05:36,090
with that franchise or that series. Because it wasn't um, what's the designer's name,

732
02:05:36,090 --> 02:05:40,810
he was commissioned to do two or three games for the Xbox. And then that was it.

733
02:05:40,810 --> 02:05:44,090
And there was talk that he might do another one, but never came out never happened.

734
02:05:44,890 --> 02:05:55,100
The same guy that did Blue Dragon, right? Blue was Blue Dragon, right? Am I thinking

735
02:05:55,100 --> 02:06:05,829
of the right thing? Am I excited for cooking simulator tomorrow? Oh, hell yeah. So yeah,

736
02:06:05,829 --> 02:06:10,949
I did want to see another installment in the series. I thought if they had a second go at

737
02:06:10,949 --> 02:06:13,430
it, they could have improved on some of the things that I didn't like it made a better

738
02:06:13,430 --> 02:06:17,829
game. And, you know, I think it was like a solid game to begin with. But yeah,

739
02:06:20,409 --> 02:06:27,510
but thank you for the 250 Rock Esper creamy sensation. Thanks for the $5. Appreciate it.

740
02:06:28,659 --> 02:06:34,020
No message. Thank you. Sergio, but thanks for the 250. I've been under a few times

741
02:06:34,020 --> 02:06:40,970
and each time has been such a trip. I had a liver biopsy at like 17. And I was still

742
02:06:40,970 --> 02:06:48,220
young enough to be in the pediatric hospital. So I came to just slurring. Oh,

743
02:06:48,220 --> 02:06:54,939
fuck, that feels so weird. I can't even feel my eyes yet. God damn it. Next to a five-year-old

744
02:06:54,939 --> 02:07:10,199
playing on his iPad. Oh, that's a good, that's a good story. That was a good story.

745
02:07:11,399 --> 02:07:28,140
Oh, fuck, this feels so weird. Thank you for the 250 Sergio, but and then Space Dad rules.

746
02:07:28,140 --> 02:07:33,750
Thanks for the $15 right at the very end. They say, I love you. Thank you. Space Dad rules

747
02:07:35,020 --> 02:07:44,220
15 bucks. Not even a minute ago. Thank you so much. And that's going to be it for tonight.

748
02:07:46,199 --> 02:07:54,420
I will see you guys. I will see you guys tomorrow. Tomorrow is going to be a new game

749
02:07:54,420 --> 02:08:00,500
called on this show. That's not the name of the game. The game is going to be called

750
02:08:00,500 --> 02:08:04,899
Cooking Simulator. I'm going to show you some healthy recipes that you can have in your home

751
02:08:06,100 --> 02:08:21,770
with low spices. I promise on the next Actas. Maybe the whole stream is Dr. Roz. Okay. If I

752
02:08:21,770 --> 02:08:28,039
didn't, if I didn't say anything, if I just, if I talked like that, just from the beginning

753
02:08:28,039 --> 02:08:33,850
of the stream, people would be fucking so irritated by that. I think if I didn't like

754
02:08:33,850 --> 02:08:39,829
make it a joke, if I was just doing that, I would give that like 15 to 20 minutes before people

755
02:08:39,829 --> 02:08:46,659
were like, stop doing this. Stop fucking doing that. Why are you doing that? And I just didn't,

756
02:08:46,659 --> 02:08:51,750
it would, I would get too self-conscious and have to stop it unless it was like a very

757
02:08:51,750 --> 02:08:58,869
specific bit or routine that I was planning or doing. I couldn't talk like Dr. Oz during the

758
02:08:58,869 --> 02:09:06,819
whole stream. You say you think that would be funny, but after five minutes, let's see.

759
02:09:14,579 --> 02:09:20,739
Dr. Oz for Jerma Rumble. Okay. Yeah. Yup. Oh, you better fucking believe it. I swear to God.

760
02:09:22,119 --> 02:09:30,710
I swear to God. Yes. I'm seeing a lot of nos. Yes. I don't care. Dr. Oz is going to be like

761
02:09:30,710 --> 02:09:39,609
in the next ladder match. You heard it here first. It's going to happen. This is a one-off

762
02:09:39,609 --> 02:09:45,770
joke. Yes. I know. So the 13, 1400 people here, you're the only people that are going to

763
02:09:45,770 --> 02:09:49,909
think this is funny. No one else is going to know what this is. And that's, I don't care.

764
02:09:49,909 --> 02:09:59,260
That's fine. And scan his face and like put it in. People are going to be like, why is Dr. Oz

765
02:09:59,260 --> 02:10:04,939
here? Do you watch Dr. Oz? The only way that would be possible is if I watched Dr. Oz every

766
02:10:04,939 --> 02:10:13,510
day. And I like was a fan. I'll just pretend to be a fan. Yeah. That sounds about right.

767
02:10:19,500 --> 02:10:23,579
Now. Yeah. Now I got to watch Dr. Oz to get some info so I can make some

768
02:10:24,539 --> 02:10:32,489
interesting references. I'm going to do some Dr. Oz research. Yeah. I got to find out

769
02:10:32,489 --> 02:10:41,829
what kind of shirts he wears, the pants he wears. All right. I'll see you guys tomorrow. Have a good

770
02:10:41,829 --> 02:10:48,420
rest of your night. But hold on. Moo means Moo just came with five dollars. Moo means Moo hospital

771
02:10:48,420 --> 02:10:53,300
Yelp review. They got my order wrong. I went in for blood work and they took out a kidney

772
02:10:53,300 --> 02:11:02,550
instead. Terrible service. One star. Thank you Moo. All right. See you guys tomorrow.

773
02:11:02,550 --> 02:11:07,350
Cooking simulator. Should be fun. Take care. Have a great rest of your night.
