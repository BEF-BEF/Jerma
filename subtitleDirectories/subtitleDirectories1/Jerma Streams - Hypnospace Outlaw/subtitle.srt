1
00:00:02,549 --> 00:00:13,820
What is sicko mode? What is that? I just keep seeing it. I don't know what it is. Is it a

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:28,760
Spongebob reference? I see it on Spongebob videos. Yes. Yeah, it's a rap song from Spongebob.

3
00:00:33,429 --> 00:00:39,530
You are sick, so you are in the sick mode. Yeah, I'm sick in a couple of strange ways.

4
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:50,950
Somebody just fall up! Yeah, we gotta fall up! I can't be loud. I'll explain what's going on

5
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,789
to everybody that's out of the loop. Like, where the fuck has he been for three days?

6
00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:02,310
Yeah, just wait. We'll just let some people trickle in and we'll discuss all these things, okay?

7
00:01:03,109 --> 00:01:46,060
See you in just a second. Hey, so I'm seeing some people say it was the seaman mic and I hate to

8
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:53,909
think that that's even remotely possible. No, I don't think it was. This is uh, that would be

9
00:01:53,909 --> 00:02:02,439
horrible. I would not sleep for the rest of my life if I knew that that's what it was. If I

10
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:07,430
actually shoved the butthole mic up the ass in the mouth, I would have been really bad. This is not

11
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:15,289
even an M rated stream. I gotta, what am I doing? You know, this is not a, I'm not one of those like

12
00:02:15,289 --> 00:02:30,889
18 plus streams. I better, I better cut it out. We said the F word, which is, was that 18? No,

13
00:02:30,889 --> 00:02:39,340
no, no, no, no, no. They said, they said fucking venom. PG-13 is now allowed like two or three

14
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:50,780
fucks and shits, right? Why is there not another rating? You know, there should be two more ratings.

15
00:02:53,050 --> 00:03:02,949
One like 30 plus and have it be movies like the notebook. You can't go to that movie unless you're

16
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:12,180
30. There should be another one. Okay, so PG-13 and then you get all the way to 18. No, this should

17
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:19,580
be like a, this should be like a, I don't know. I don't know. How do you fix that? I used all my

18
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:28,439
swears from today. It's called NC-17. NC-17 doesn't exist. That Peggy 16. There it is. The Europeans

19
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:37,259
know what they're doing. They got it right. You understand, Peggy 16. Why do we have Peggy's 13?

20
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:43,379
I don't understand. The America's got to get with the times, man.

21
00:03:49,689 --> 00:04:00,419
Yeah, Peggy 33. You see like a Peggy 16. That is a god of war.

22
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:14,870
The next trailer that you get at E3, Peggy 33. Hidden object game. Look, I see it over there.

23
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:26,870
Do you see it? Anyways, let's go over a couple things before we get started with Hypno Space

24
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:34,439
Enforcer. I've been gone for a few days, not because I wanted to be gone, because I had

25
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:43,160
some medical problems. Those of you that know that I have migraines and sometimes they're okay,

26
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:48,410
sometimes they're bad, sometimes they're not so bad. Usually if I have one maybe every couple

27
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:55,129
months and what it does is it kind of puts me out of commission for six to eight hours or so. I'll

28
00:04:55,129 --> 00:05:00,810
be okay and then I can get back to normal. I had a migraine two days ago, two or three,

29
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:06,310
whatever it was. It was the day after the sea man stream and it was the worst migraine I've had in

30
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:12,569
probably three or four years. It was horrible. I feel like I was in the exorcist. I believe in

31
00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:16,490
exorcism now because it happened to me. A demon fucking came out of my body. There's no way it

32
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:26,790
didn't. They must have been a priest. They must have been doing an exorcism two doors down and

33
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:32,420
it didn't work. The priest is sitting there going, I don't understand why this is not working. This

34
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:38,500
child is obviously possessed. He ends up leaving. They have like tea and shit and I'm just sitting

35
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:52,620
there in my bed like. So a priest, if you're watching, it worked. It worked on me, but it

36
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:58,149
shut me off for two days and then for some reason all of my digestive problems came back

37
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:07,750
the next day. So I've been kind of working at like 60% the last day or two. That's why I didn't want

38
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:13,829
to stream because I didn't want to have some like sick shitty stream or I'm just like turning it on

39
00:06:13,829 --> 00:06:22,470
like, okay guys, here we go. Hey guys, so we're gonna play. No. So what I'm gonna do is I still feel

40
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:27,639
kind of sloppy. So I don't know how long this stream is going to be. We're just going to kind

41
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:35,240
of play it by ear. I do plan on streaming tomorrow and maybe the next day depends,

42
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:43,879
but I'm gonna take another few days off. I have a couple of friends coming in, like my mother's

43
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:49,480
coming in soon over the next 30 days here. My friend's coming in like next week. I have to be

44
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,500
healthy. So I'm gonna have to take another couple days off, probably three or four days off,

45
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,680
because I want to go to the doctor and just see what the fuck's going on. Because this,

46
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:05,379
it was the worst migraine I've had in years, like I said. So pardon my absence over the next,

47
00:07:05,379 --> 00:07:11,350
probably as of stream today, stream tomorrow, maybe stream the next day, and then I'm probably

48
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:20,069
going to be gone for like three, four days. Can we meet your mom? Maybe. If she's comfortable

49
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:28,139
doing that, maybe. I mean, you've already met her, but anyways, let's get started. So pardon my

50
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:36,329
potential. Is he off today? He seems off today. I am. So just want to get that out of the way.

51
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:40,410
I get to have a, that's just great. I get to have a blanket statement. Oh, you know, guys,

52
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:47,670
the stream like not going to be good today. Perfect. That means you have such a low expectation.

53
00:07:47,670 --> 00:08:01,589
I'm going to pull the rug up from underneath you. Let's get this off. And here we are. So what I

54
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:05,930
know about this game, there's only a few things that I know, is that actually, I don't know

55
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:10,170
anything at all. I know this is a game where you pretend to go on the internet in the 90s,

56
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:18,740
and I figured it was in slightly relaxing kind of hangout stream, and maybe it's not.

57
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:27,050
Maybe I'm going to trigger a new migraine. We'll find out. But if you weren't alive,

58
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:36,389
if you're not a 90s kid, then you're not going to know what this is like. Just read the title.

59
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:49,370
Okay. So I know that you're an enforcer and you have to scour the internet for bad pages.

60
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:53,559
I don't know. Okay. Enter your name. Custom pronunciation. What the hell does that mean?

61
00:08:53,559 --> 00:09:14,440
Should it be like that? Custom pronunciation? Is that better? No, this is fine.

62
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:23,159
How? What does this mean? Custom pronunciation. German.

63
00:09:27,669 --> 00:09:34,820
That? German. Okay. Should I have the custom pronunciation be the 985?

64
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:51,370
German 985. No, no, no. It's not 85. German 985. There it is. 85. No, I don't want to say that.

65
00:09:51,370 --> 00:10:07,029
Just German is fine. Hypno OS version 1.04 November 5, 1999. Double click the question

66
00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:19,379
mark to begin. It is 1999. This is 1105. This is November 5th. Or no, it's not. This is the day.

67
00:10:19,379 --> 00:10:28,440
I have no idea. Is this British? Is this a British game? All right. Here's the settings.

68
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,700
This is the fitness tab. Here's the app menu. Okay. Let's double click here.

69
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:44,419
The future is you. Turn it up a little. Your passion, your imagination.

70
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:49,139
I love the compressed video. Your hard work. We're used to seeing this shit.

71
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:56,519
And now, with the help of hypnospace, you have the tools. Remember that. Tense already. Remember

72
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:05,419
that clock. To make it a reality. Witness the dawning of a new world where sleep time is no

73
00:11:05,419 --> 00:11:10,220
longer downtime. You turn into a... It's where the future is built. You turn into like a serial

74
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:20,230
commercial advertising. A future built by you. Hypnospace. You turn into a gushers commercial

75
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:25,429
advertisement. Welcome to hypnospace patrol department enforcer training. Okay. Enforcer

76
00:11:25,429 --> 00:11:35,659

00:11:49,049 --> 00:11:54,009
in several key areas. Okay. This tutorial will guide you through everything you need to know

80
00:11:54,009 --> 00:11:58,330
to best serve your fellow hypnospace citizens. What's with the WarioWare guy here? What's with

81
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:14,059
the WarioWare face? Let's do this. Why does everybody have like a WarioWare avatar? Okay.

82
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:24,230
Using hypnos. Direct your attention to the top of your desktop and you'll notice the

83
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:29,909
hypnos info bar. From left to right, this handy toolkit features quick access to...

84
00:12:29,909 --> 00:12:36,740
You're old. To the settings menu. What? The quick switcher.

85
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:49,419
The application menu. I love this. The current date and time. Your hypno coin balance. Hypno coin?

86
00:12:49,419 --> 00:12:54,139
The restart and log off buttons. Where do I get those? Make sure to click the log off button to save

87
00:12:54,139 --> 00:13:00,860
your progress and safely exit Hypno-S. The info bar may be repositioned anywhere along the top

88
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:08,259
or bottom of your desktop. Okay. You can move it around. The settings menu you can do. I'll

89
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:15,320
probably just open that now. How are we doing on volume? Probably fine. Sound effects, sound effects,

90
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:22,279
special effects, key special effects, mouse special effects, caption, all hype speech,

91
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:29,899
uh, autoplay, rage music, page music, voice speed. Hypno space is great.

92
00:13:31,419 --> 00:13:40,039
Okay, that's fine. Turn it up a little. Robot language only. That's just fine. Pizza? Display.

93
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:49,350
What wallpaper should we have? These ones are gonna hurt my head. In fact, all of these are

94
00:13:49,350 --> 00:14:02,100
gonna hurt my head. Which one is gonna hurt the least? Probably this one. Oops. Now that one's

95
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:17,049
fine. Theme. Olivine alloy eggplant. Screen saver. Oozle drip. That's probably the one. Yep. Wow,

96
00:14:17,049 --> 00:14:27,049
this is really scratching the 90s computer itch. No, I don't want that one. That one's cool.

97
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:41,529
Wow, computers really did suck. Kids make this shit in Roblox now. Humans are progressing too

98
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:53,139
fast. Somebody set up Minecraft electricity blocks and probably made this. This has been

99
00:14:53,139 --> 00:15:03,539
10 to 15 years. Why are we going so fast? What's gonna happen in like another 20 years?

100
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:09,960
It's called redstone. Yeah, whatever. That's, I know. All right. Pizazz. Mouse trail. Uh,

101
00:15:11,289 --> 00:15:22,539
that shit's fucking annoying. Is that, doesn't this mean less mouse trail?

102
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:29,029
No, there we go. Yeah, I don't want the, like, I'm on mushroom's mouse.

103
00:15:29,669 --> 00:15:38,940
12 hour time. That's good. Double click icons. Okay. All right. Sounds good. Nice smooth mouse

104
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:46,580
experience. The streamers on mushrooms. Set captions. Yeah, I probably should do that too,

105
00:15:46,580 --> 00:16:00,059
shouldn't I? Caption all high piece speech. Okay, let's go. Did I do the pizza menu? I did. Yeah,

106
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:05,740
I just want to make sure. Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep. All right. Next. I can move this around too.

107
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:11,259
It's fine up there. Hippie, also known as the hypnospace intelligent intermediary, is your

digital helper. He'll notify you when you receive important messages and even alert you to new

109
00:16:16,539 --> 00:16:24,440
hypno-ass system updates. Hippie is always happy to help. Here's a useful tip. Right click any text

110
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:30,600
in hypnospace and Hippie will read it out loud. Whether you're new to hypnospace or a veteran

111
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:36,200
citizen, you've come to the right place. It's like the manager's talking in the background.

112
00:16:38,809 --> 00:16:43,940
Okay, so you can right click any text and he'll read it out loud. Okay. Enable

113
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:51,539
caption in settings for additional captions. Digital helper. Yep. So let's see.

114

Hypno-s enforcer edition is different from the standard version of hypno-s in several key areas.

116
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:09,980
This tutorial will guide you through everything you need to know to best serve your fellow

117
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:17,180
hypnospace citizens. I'm getting some real 3D movie maker vibes. Let's do this. All right,

118
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:24,140
select a topic. Let's see. We've got chime laws, HSPD inbox, HSPD cases, investigating citizens

119
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:28,859
enforcement tools. What about the, let's go laws. Chime is an easy way to remember the five types

120
00:17:28,859 --> 00:17:34,460
of violations that we'd like enforcers to keep an eye out for. C stands for content infringement.

121
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:41,660
H is for harassment. I for illegal activity. M for malicious software. And E is for extralegal

122
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:47,259
commerce. Find more information in the HSPD handbook. Extralegal? Does that mean that

123
00:17:47,259 --> 00:17:51,180
a lawyer is there every time you make a transaction? He just sits there and watches

124
00:17:51,180 --> 00:18:00,970
you transact the money. How about it's extralegal? Beyond legal. Outside of the law. Why would it just

125
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:08,329
be illegal? Sue, that's so legal. I've got a notary, a lawyer, and a doctor there watching

126
00:18:08,329 --> 00:18:14,599
me transact my muffin business. All right, so content infringement. We're going to like content

127
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:20,980
ID claim, harassment, illegal content, malicious software. All right, let's say click the video to

128
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:26,900
pause and resume. Okay, so we chime. Let me see. I got to remember that. Chime, content infringement.

129
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:33,430
I'm not looking at the screen. H, harassment. I, infection of software. No, illegal content. Okay.

130
00:18:34,069 --> 00:18:43,259
I is illegal. M is for malicious software. E is extralegal. So why is there an I and an E?

131
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:50,410
Illegal content and extralegal content. Okay, but this is commerce. So this is okay. All right.

132
00:18:51,609 --> 00:18:54,900
You don't need to memorize this. Oh, all right. There we go.

133
00:18:54,900 --> 00:19:03,259
Thank you for volunteering to help keep our wonderful community of hypno space citizens safe.

enforcers have access to. Nice. The inbox allows you to receive messages from merchant soft,

138
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:31,420
hypno space, or HSPD dispatch agents. You may also receive automated communications from

139
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:38,539
some messages come with files attached. Attached files will appear at the top of the

140
00:19:38,539 --> 00:19:44,940
message and look like this. Attached files will be downloaded to your Hypno S download manager.

141
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:53,109
But then what am I supposed to do? Read messages sent from the dispatch to or automated

142
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:57,430
communications from hypnos space pages. Some messages contain file attachments which are stored

143
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:01,829
in the download manager. So what if somebody sends me illegal content? What am I supposed to

144
00:20:01,829 --> 00:20:10,630
do? Report them? Is there a report button? The cases tab opens as a database of all cases

145
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:17,029
you've accepted. Most of your time will be spent on cases assigned to you by an HSPD dispatch agent.

146
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:22,230
Cases are generated in response to complaints from hypno space citizens or leads from the

147
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:28,789
hypno space security team. Once a violation has been found, the offending citizen's name will be

148
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:33,990
listed here. Click to jump to the page to the where the violation was removed from.

149
00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:40,710
Once all reported violations have been found in a case, you may close it by clicking the close

150
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:47,430
case button. Upon closing a case, you will earn a bonus payout of five hypno coin per violation reported.

151
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:55,349
Bitco coins, bitco coins, all right. So this is the main important portion of the okay let's think

152
00:20:55,349 --> 00:21:00,789
about this. You get cases, you gotta investigate, you gotta get evidence, and then you get Bicno coins.

153
00:21:00,869 --> 00:21:10,869
Got it. So let's look at the end box cases. We did this already. Investigating citizens. Here we go.

154
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:15,349
The version of hypno space explorer you'll be using has been modified with an expanded search feature

155
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:20,309
enabling you to find unlisted pages by searching for the tags that they contain.

156
00:21:20,309 --> 00:21:27,130
Search illegal. Good time scam watch. Bad citizen McGee's page. Bad citizens. Yeah I'm bad. So

157
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:33,339
don't you know anything about being illegal? Why would you put illegal content in the

158
00:21:33,339 --> 00:21:40,410

159

a little easier. Or maybe not. View list. Hypno space's citizens place the pages they've built

163

Secret coins. What do you do with the coins? There were plenty of VR stuff they tried before

187
00:24:51,819 --> 00:24:59,960
2000s. The virtual boy doesn't count as VR. Virtual boy was an eye microwaving device.

295
00:38:03,429 --> 00:38:10,059

296
00:38:10,059 --> 00:38:15,019
gooper feature about being safety minded in all kinds of different situations. It's old but such

302
00:38:51,849 --> 00:39:01,699
even if it is nice. Is this real artwork you think? Gumshoe gooper finds a bag with bad stuff.

303
00:39:01,699 --> 00:39:05,300
He tells a grown-up and they throw the bad stuff in the trash can. The end.

479
01:11:46,199 --> 01:12:03,909
seepage review heavy brooding hybrid rock rap for the teenage set scrape records it's easy to

480
01:12:03,909 --> 01:12:08,390
immediately dismiss bands that have such a blatantly manufactured facade but to do

481
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:12,390
this with seepage would be a mistake the group's image may not age well i believe that their music

482
01:12:12,390 --> 01:12:18,949
will be remembered as something special seepage's debut self-titled record packed with

483
01:12:18,949 --> 01:12:26,710
inventive production inspired fusion of heavy riffs and hip-hop beats okay the lyrics are

484
01:12:26,710 --> 01:12:30,310
not technically impressive we're looking for a name of a record or a name of a song

485
01:12:31,270 --> 01:12:37,779
they always have scrape records are angling for angst-ridden teenagers

486
01:12:37,779 --> 01:12:40,420
see if you've recorded something tight fresh and enjoyable

487
01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:58,840

668
01:43:46,699 --> 01:44:01,979

669
01:44:01,979 --> 01:44:12,949
is i don't think the squisher is deception uh-oh well her princess in the midst thereof are like

670
01:44:12,949 --> 01:44:19,109
wolves ravening the prey to shed blood and destroy souls to dishonest gain ezekiel

671
01:44:19,909 --> 01:44:26,859
the wolf of squisher z the bible warns about woes many times it's a streamer

672
01:44:28,340 --> 01:44:36,329
that's a twitch name that hat that's that's like a top 500 fortnight player has to be

673
01:44:39,539 --> 01:44:46,840
and he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and satan and bound him a

674
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:54,840
thousand years revelation all right that thing's zooming how much more convincing do you need a

675
01:44:54,840 --> 01:44:59,960
serpent for kids to play with if you need more evidence let's look at his eyes for a moment

676
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:15,539
what is this i don't understand what this is a picture of a squisher z's it's like a cartoon

677
01:45:15,539 --> 01:45:21,109
or something the snake's eye very clearly drawn to look like the egyptian third eye

678
01:45:23,510 --> 01:45:29,109
the eye of chorus this eye supposedly grants its viewer sight that transcends good and evil

679
01:45:29,989 --> 01:45:36,100
meaning the snake is teaching our kids that good and evil do not exist who else tried to erase

680
01:45:36,100 --> 01:45:42,949
good and evil i'll give you a hint satan did in the garden in his serpent form then the serpent

681
01:45:42,949 --> 01:45:49,350
said to the woman you will not surely die for god knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will

682
01:45:49,350 --> 01:45:58,069
be opened and you'll be like god knowing good and evil that's from genesis three four six and

683
01:45:58,069 --> 01:46:06,859
we're not through yet let's take a closer look at this popular giraffe squisher there's no way

684
01:46:06,859 --> 01:46:10,539
this funny looking creature can carry a hidden message can it i'll let you see for yourselves

685
01:46:12,859 --> 01:46:18,939
not so cute anymore is it nope it is not

686
01:46:18,939 --> 01:46:28,779
jesus paid it i can't take it anymore that's right pentagramic markings right on your kid's

687
01:46:28,779 --> 01:46:34,380
toys how did this happen when a generation grows up without the lord what do you expect

688
01:46:35,319 --> 01:46:41,800
we were so busy having nice little pageants and school plays that we forgot god now this rebellious

689
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:48,279
generation is in charge and we're reaping what we have sown these people make the popular cartoons

690
01:46:48,279 --> 01:46:54,920
and movies and design the toys for our children and grandchildren if you think these people have

691
01:46:54,920 --> 01:47:00,619
your kids best interest at heart think again at best they are unwitting servants of satan

692
01:47:00,619 --> 01:47:06,220
at worst they are card carrying members of the cult there's a lot more where this came from we're

693
01:47:06,220 --> 01:47:15,770
just getting started okay well you kind of go squisher z we're gonna have to remember that

695
01:47:40,380 --> 01:47:41,500

01:47:59,829 --> 01:48:05,460

called stickle for a short time and rather than being played in a circular court with three

1101
02:50:32,409 --> 02:50:43,420
participants it was played in a much more sensible rectangle with two participants what pictured as

done with cyber worlds if you're not into the culture of cool punk you might be skeptical but

1122
02:56:32,489 --> 02:56:39,690
to me the cool fest 99 announcement says it all graze peak gets it graze peak may be a big company

1123
02:56:39,690 --> 02:56:44,250
but is run by people whoever those people are they obviously get what cool punk is about

1124
02:56:47,020 --> 02:56:53,780
what is what is cool not only that but they helped get freezer signed to estonic a respected

1125
02:56:53,780 --> 02:56:59,540
independent record label or even setting him up for his own concert and helped him release a single

1126
02:56:59,540 --> 02:57:09,750
like cool punk is on the radio it's a fan a group freezer verified by hypnosis community leader

1127

police people if you have any issues let me know there we go what is cool punk what is cool punk

1129
02:57:33,190 --> 02:57:42,979
anyway it all started around christmas of 1998 jan wolf was on break from school for the holidays

1130
02:57:42,979 --> 02:57:50,180
and was very very bored he found an old acapella tape recording of the graze peak cola theme song

1131
02:57:51,219 --> 02:57:56,200
as a joke he decided to mix it into his music much to his surprise it sounded very cool

1132
02:57:57,079 --> 02:58:02,569
in december of 1998 he released a seven minute song featuring this new cool punk music he invented

1133
02:58:03,690 --> 02:58:09,909
called colder than the rest it was an underground hit especially in hypnospace where it had the most

1134
02:58:09,909 --> 02:58:16,010
fans even though the first release was popular and made cool punk an underground sensation

1135

03:44:58,200 --> 03:45:03,399

1495
03:56:55,780 --> 03:57:00,020
because i have good behavior but that's because i don't ever use hypnospace other than for listening

to songs haha if you are having trouble you can contact me but i am sometimes busy and i'm also

03:58:47,110 --> 03:58:55,860
to its fullest with my husband this is sandy okay sandy gumshoe gooper statement why are they all

1506
03:58:55,860 --> 03:59:06,500
obsessed with the gooper thing hello my loves please don't take this as me being against you all

1507
03:59:06,579 --> 03:59:09,860
but i think we should not be putting the gumshoe gooper cartoons on our page it

1508
03:59:10,500 --> 03:59:16,809
if we brig's estate doesn't want us to it doesn't seem like merchant soft are lying about this one

1509
03:59:16,809 --> 03:59:27,579
beef brain is a hoax click here to go to my humor picture gallery yeah we already saw these gumshoe

1510
03:59:27,579 --> 03:59:41,479
gooper was on here anymore beef brain is a hoax stop falling for these obvious tricks hello friends

1511
03:59:41,479 --> 03:59:46,440
i understand that some of you are concerned that hypnospace can hurt your brain and who knows maybe

1512
03:59:46,440 --> 03:59:51,399
it can but i have to say that this beef brain thing is very suspicious if you look at the bottom

1513
03:59:51,399 --> 03:59:57,430
of the beef brain main page it says something about minks if i remember right these are the

1514
03:59:57,430 --> 04:00:02,469
same hooligans who pulled the explosive headband prank and then half of you put that horrible

1515
04:00:02,469 --> 04:00:09,020
horrible song on your page in order to prevent your head from blowing up if the hypnospace

1516
04:00:09,020 --> 04:00:14,950
headband is unhealthy it's probably just because it makes you tired and not some crazy brain

1517
04:00:16,780 --> 04:00:30,899
love sandy okay sandy the dumpster the dumpster page should be shut down i don't know how they

1518
04:00:30,899 --> 04:00:35,159
get away with tearing people down all the time arlen your artwork is awesome don't listen to

1519
04:00:35,159 --> 04:00:40,620
these spoiled punks who wouldn't know good art if it bit them in the behind if they were any good

1520
04:00:40,620 --> 04:01:04,760
they wouldn't hide their page like slimy cowards we're going the dumpster taking out hypnospace's

1521
04:01:04,760 --> 04:01:18,139
trash so you don't have to previous dumpings i went to cool fest 99 this event was incredible

1522
04:01:18,139 --> 04:01:23,739
cool punk is finally dead folks and cool fest killed it from the moment i stepped out of my

1523
04:01:23,739 --> 04:01:29,530
car onto the ironically scorching pavement of the king amphitheater parking lot i knew this was

1524
04:01:29,530 --> 04:01:37,559
going to be special germa lied about minecraft vr thanks to five community subs again your

1525
04:01:37,559 --> 04:01:47,350
username is going to be pretty pretty irrelevant in like a week when i play minecraft vr but thank

1526
04:01:47,350 --> 04:01:55,540
you so much for your five subs okay hold on sandwich between two enormous ads for extra

1527
04:01:55,540 --> 04:02:00,579
thick chips was the cool fest ticket window waiting patiently in front of where 200 people

1528
04:02:00,579 --> 04:02:05,059
not quite the 5 000 person turnout the cool fest plan as we're hoping for here's a highly

1529
04:02:05,059 --> 04:02:12,920
scientific pie chart of the attendee types confused 45 year old chowder man fans 15

1530
04:02:12,920 --> 04:02:21,659
year old cool punk kids and parents of 15 year old cool punk kids is this a fire festival

1531
04:02:21,659 --> 04:02:28,069
jab here after grabbing our tickets a venue attendant had us from another line at the

1532
04:02:28,069 --> 04:02:33,989
opposite end of the venue for our promised joeman merch only the cool punk kids and parents hit

1533
04:02:33,989 --> 04:02:39,399
this line with the chowder man people heading inside to get good seats for his opening act

1534
04:02:39,399 --> 04:02:44,680
after waiting for nearly an hour for the merch to show up the sound of tires screeching called

1535
04:02:44,680 --> 04:02:50,250
our attention to a truck speeding towards us knocking a few trash cans over on the way

1536
04:02:50,250 --> 04:02:57,129
some sweaty guy emerged with a single box of joeman keychains no shirts and no free grace

1537
04:02:58,090 --> 04:03:04,409
as promised people were pissed and the keychains were used as projectiles throughout the rest of

1538
04:03:04,409 --> 04:03:13,930
the evening chowder man had already launched into the chowder man's hotel room let's get some

1539
04:03:13,930 --> 04:03:51,590
what did i download where's uh where's chowder man there we go found it to be appropriate

1540
04:03:51,590 --> 04:03:55,940
chowder man had already launched into the chowder man's hotel room when me and the

1541
04:03:55,940 --> 04:04:00,739
gaggle of cool punk kids and parents arrived at the stage he followed it up with some eight

1542
04:04:00,739 --> 04:04:05,860
minute song about shaving a couple of newer rap rock songs with his new band cruncher

1543
04:04:05,860 --> 04:04:11,379
and an encore of an extended version of the greys peak jingle no one really cared or seemed

1544
04:04:11,379 --> 04:04:17,459
particularly into the stuff until the greys peak thing then it happened a helicopter landed on a

1545
04:04:17,459 --> 04:04:26,340
platform in the middle of the crowd and the band ate and a few the band and a few fans from that

1546
04:04:26,420 --> 04:04:32,500
stage hopped aboard i was surprised that the thing even made it safely with all the wires hanging

1547
04:04:32,500 --> 04:04:38,979
around as i'm sure you all know chowder man crashed his copter old chowder's leg had to be

1548
04:04:38,979 --> 04:04:43,620
amputated and their drummer died i can't bring myself to be awful about this because it was

1549
04:04:43,620 --> 04:04:49,979
harrowing to watch do you think they'd call it a night after a helicopter crash but no cool fest

1550
04:04:49,979 --> 04:04:56,139
continued an old guy from greys peak a guy in a joeman costume and a few merchant saw people

1551
04:04:56,139 --> 04:05:00,620
came up and gave a speech about how amazing and dedicated cool punk fans are and threw a

1552
04:05:00,620 --> 04:05:07,420
few shirts into the crowd it would have been weird anyway but the crash just made it completely

1553
04:05:07,420 --> 04:05:14,059
surreal to watch freezer hit the stage next and played for only 15 minutes before it became clear

1554
04:05:14,059 --> 04:05:20,139
that he was lip syncing the cool punk kids started yelling mild swear words and started throwing

1555
04:05:20,139 --> 04:05:25,500
their joeman key change on stage an old guy came out and told everyone that cool fest was over

1556
04:05:26,139 --> 04:05:30,940
and that was it needless to say the event exceeded my expectations

1557
04:05:44,440 --> 04:05:49,979
well that was fucking rude that was very well written too that's a very good comedy write-up

1558
04:05:49,979 --> 04:06:04,120
right there all right so the dumpster i want to cool fester it is too popular now currently

1559
04:06:04,120 --> 04:06:08,360
filling the void the ditch exchange left behind after merchants off banned it until recently

1560
04:06:08,360 --> 04:06:14,040
people were only using it to post rips of the bad obscure music they listen to but now the hypnospace

1561
04:06:14,040 --> 04:06:21,020
ravel is sharing passwords i guess and it's getting really really bizarre oh like do these

1562

people get that it's private here are a bunch of interesting poems this is a password these are

1563
04:06:28,440 --> 04:06:37,350
passwords drawings of cars with human heads even chowder man himself is using it and well just see

1564
04:06:37,350 --> 04:06:48,739

1570
04:07:35,750 --> 04:07:42,809
like what they're done it's dumb as hell but i love it instead of a list of pages you have

1571
04:07:42,809 --> 04:07:48,569
to navigate their zone by clicking arrows on a giant multi-page map and click on landmarks to

1572
04:07:48,569 --> 04:07:55,909
visit their pages it takes ages to find what you're looking for i have sticky notes maybe

04:09:51,700 --> 04:09:56,340
the freelance page so technically anyone who knows about it can get in and make changes

1584

know if this was you being funny or what because everyone shares music nowadays but the fact of

2023
05:43:03,139 --> 05:43:09,130
the matter is that our whole team knows about my flist page now if any of our interns are snitches

2024
05:43:09,930 --> 05:43:16,090
you could really cause a problem for me and the entire company we're doing some amazing things

2025
05:43:16,090 --> 05:43:20,490
over here and i'll be damned if some little idiot is going to bring it crashing down because they

2309
06:40:40,900 --> 06:40:45,860
reached out to me about supporting the h.a.p i literally jumped for joy there was something

2310
06:40:45,860 --> 06:40:52,340
special about hypnospace it felt like a livid in place that folks out there trying to preserve its

2311
06:40:52,340 --> 06:41:01,319
history inspires me greatly sorry about the old picture did you use a hypnospace in 98.99 it sure

2312
06:41:01,319 --> 06:41:08,139
did if so did you do anything embarrassing i'm not so sure it's been ages from my age at the time it

2313
06:41:08,139 --> 06:41:14,139
was highly probable young tamara didn't know where to take her life she was an autumn leaf blown

2314
06:41:14,139 --> 06:41:19,259
every which way by people in social movements and her own creative whims what are you up to now

2315
06:41:19,979 --> 06:41:26,779
i'm a poet for children i wrote a few anthologies that kids your kids have probably seen at their

2316
06:41:26,779 --> 06:41:37,060
school library between the angry spaces and river river river river how's chowder man doing okay

2317
06:41:37,540 --> 06:41:51,590
interesting uh okay let's see i have tim's page tim stevens profile there he is it is not an

2319
06:41:54,790 --> 06:42:04,180
any messages directly thank you i'm just gonna let it die i'm sorry feels a little strange using

2320
06:42:04,180 --> 06:42:08,819
this page builder so many years later but yes hi i'm tim yep the same thing you probably heard

2321
06:42:08,819 --> 06:42:13,939
about back in 2000 yes i went to prison and yes i spent the whole six years there i'm much different

2322
06:42:13,939 --> 06:42:21,479
now as anyone is after adolescence i did use hyper hypno space in 98 you do anything embarrassing

2323
06:42:22,040 --> 06:42:25,319
i'm not really sure how to answer this one embarrassing is not the right word for what i

2324
06:42:25,319 --> 06:42:33,400
caused i still think about it every day and i'm deeply deeply sorry for it i was a kid missing

2325
06:42:33,400 --> 06:42:39,159
around with tech that i knew almost nothing about my entire world revolved around wooing a girl

2326
06:42:39,799 --> 06:42:45,479
i was infatuated with and getting into a hacker group and i would have done anything to impress

2327
06:42:45,479 --> 06:42:50,650
either of them i had no idea that i'd even be capable of harming people with the software i'd

2328
06:42:50,650 --> 06:43:00,599
made it was all so so stupid i now work in computer security and live a contended contented life with

my wife and daughter okay uh we have chelsea chelsea's page i'm chelsea the h.a.p. co-lead along

2331
06:43:23,610 --> 06:43:27,450
it's unlikely that anyone remembers me since i never made my own hypnosis page i used chit chat

2332
06:43:27,450 --> 06:43:34,790
but hypnosis was a very important part of my life uh this whole project was my idea thankfully

2333
06:43:34,790 --> 06:43:41,459
tomorrow was interested enough to help foot the bill i did use it do anything embarrassing nope

2334
06:43:41,459 --> 06:43:46,779
if i ever got around to making a page i wouldn't have plenty i'd have plenty to share okay not a

2335
06:43:46,779 --> 06:43:50,860
whole lot really just working a boring office job and reminiscing about hypnosis in my off time

2336

2346
06:45:21,130 --> 06:45:26,970
only in hypno space and would otherwise be lost to time all you need to do is view the page that

2347
06:45:26,970 --> 06:45:33,299
these things exist on and they'll be sent to us and archived okay please do your best to find them

2348
06:45:33,299 --> 06:45:41,689
germa as your headband backups may be our last hope okay look the chowder man song okay found

2349
06:45:41,689 --> 06:45:48,139
one adrian wanted to know if you dig up a song that the chowder man wrote about his helicopter

2350
06:45:48,139 --> 06:45:55,479
accident i got that one yeah this is something i'm missing close friend of mine and famous rap star

2351
06:45:55,479 --> 06:46:00,759
remembers putting his music on hypno space when he was in his early 20s but never really getting

2352
06:46:00,759 --> 06:46:06,150
any attention all he remembers is that some guy deleted him from a listing saying that his music

2353
06:46:06,150 --> 06:46:11,909
wasn't real music because it was flip-flop and that he should do something more imaginative

2354
06:46:12,630 --> 06:46:20,520
i found him this would be a huge deal uh roddy's early test pet i'm almost certain that roddy made

2355
06:46:20,520 --> 06:46:26,200
an odd looking test pet early in november that looked like that comic book floating eye he

2356
06:46:26,200 --> 06:46:33,880
always talked about would love to play with it again weird secret eye cult all kinds of

2357
06:46:33,880 --> 06:46:38,520
pages with a strange encryption eye on them if my memory serves i'm pretty sure even adrian

2358
06:46:38,520 --> 06:46:45,450
merchant had that symbol somewhere can you find out what that's all about missing person demetri

2359
06:46:45,450 --> 06:46:50,169
jackson the daughter and ex-wife of a demetri jackson have contacted us requesting any information

2360
06:46:50,169 --> 06:47:08,580
we can find what may have happened to cause his disappearance in 1999 no i'm laughing now because

2361
06:47:08,580 --> 06:47:12,419
i'm trying not to laugh because i know that people think i'm laughing at it

2362
06:47:22,259 --> 06:47:25,619
all they know is that he was using hypno space frequently at the time and was communicating

2363
06:47:25,619 --> 06:47:29,700
frequently with a rich guy who was going to help him fund some sort of sea voyage

2364
06:47:31,290 --> 06:47:55,540
what that's me i killed him i what no i didn't i caused him to die no let me check my emails

2365
06:47:58,650 --> 06:48:09,700
you found the chowder of antoine yep welcome to the archive project i knew there had to be

2366
06:48:09,700 --> 06:48:18,840
someone out there with a working enforce it there is no mail can i just so yeah this is the

2367
06:48:20,040 --> 06:48:24,490
i mean if you form a hypno space users formed a ragtag group to preserve content from the

2368
06:48:24,490 --> 06:48:30,330
services late 1990 period just before the crash we've been unable to find anyone involved with

2369
06:48:30,330 --> 06:48:35,930
merchant soft outside of arty which is a story in itself and we're pretty certain that the backup

2370
06:48:35,930 --> 06:48:40,650
servers are long gone after merchant soft got raided you represent the first major breakthrough

2371
06:48:40,650 --> 06:48:45,369
we've had towards preserving a piece of history that would otherwise be lost please check out

2372
06:48:45,369 --> 06:48:50,490
the lost and found page on our intranet and help us track down a few of those things there

2373
06:48:52,599 --> 06:48:57,159
enforcer headband units had an entire gigabyte of internal disk space our best guess is that

2374
06:48:57,159 --> 06:49:03,720
enforcer units doubled as many backup servers which conveniently wasn't told to the unpaid

2375
06:49:03,720 --> 06:49:08,759
moderators who might have scrapped them for parts we coded a little program to help you

2376
06:49:09,479 --> 06:49:12,919
help us extract the data accessible in your headband and upload it to us

2377
06:49:13,639 --> 06:49:19,240
download and install the attached program to get started we're all really excited to see what you

i'm charting maps and looking for the most likely place of hiding treasures

2456
07:09:36,860 --> 07:09:41,099

2522
07:23:03,479 --> 07:23:12,259
floating eye he was always talking about so what's the name of this stupid thing important message

2523
07:23:12,259 --> 07:23:16,340
received from ms underscore samantha dude what do you want i still need your help what do you

2524
07:23:16,340 --> 07:23:22,229
think i'm doing you died it's been 10 seconds once upon a time i was an overworked employee

2525
07:23:22,229 --> 07:23:27,909
at merchant soft you can still see my picture on the team page while we scrambled to put together

2526
07:23:27,909 --> 07:23:35,110
the hypno os year 2000 update dylan merchant worked on whatever he pleased flissed some weird

2527
07:23:35,110 --> 07:23:41,189
big game project i also caught him hanging around in some hacker group a few hours before we went

2528
07:23:41,270 --> 07:23:45,270
live with the update a giant software package was uploaded from somewhere else in the building

2529
07:23:45,270 --> 07:23:49,830
while everyone was gearing up for the merchant soft new year's party i believe this was a

2530
07:23:49,830 --> 07:23:54,950
software patch added to the year 2000 update message received from ms underscore samantha

2531
07:23:54,950 --> 07:24:01,029
you are just firing away at the keyboard inserting last minute changes that ultimately caused the y2k

2532
07:24:01,029 --> 07:24:07,799
mine crash i believe dylan merchant is responsible for the resulting deaths i believe dylan

2533
07:24:07,880 --> 07:24:13,479
knowingly allowed tim a fellow team member you know him as tim mcgeddon to be framed for this

2534
07:24:13,479 --> 07:24:18,599
disaster and spend six years of his young life in prison i need your help to prove it details in

2535
07:24:18,599 --> 07:24:25,849
coming i need you to find and access files that prove merchant soft knew the year 2000 update

2536
07:24:25,849 --> 07:24:32,630

2593
07:33:43,689 --> 07:33:51,939
to stop it i mean i'm already the villain right and you don't want people to think you're involved

2594
07:33:51,939 --> 07:33:58,500
in illegal stuff this way you can be the hero also i promise i won't use any more bright flashing

2667
07:49:24,759 --> 07:49:31,180
there's no meaning almost all of his junk is to show off for that tiff chick it's a high school

2668
07:49:31,180 --> 07:49:36,860
mentality half of his greasy pimple friends would be in minx in no time if you invite him so no

2669
07:49:40,389 --> 07:49:46,229
no meaning is an interesting critique from the dude who runs the dumpster oh so did you see what

2670
07:49:46,229 --> 07:49:50,549
he did to those guys in teen topia that's just as if i've ever seen it small scale sure but

2671
07:49:50,549 --> 07:49:58,459
effective okay you guys were right tim just launched a year 2000 mine crash attack code

2672
07:49:59,099 --> 07:50:03,900
more gain than an attack really on hypnospace tonight and it's entirely meaningless it's

2673
07:50:03,900 --> 07:50:10,139
completely overshadowing my leak and people really need to see this i wish he'd stop it

2674
07:50:10,139 --> 07:50:15,259
with the theatrics because this could hurt people if anything happens to my leak i'm putting a backup

2675
07:50:15,259 --> 07:50:33,459
on my island in scdfl scdfl that's freelance so that's reckoning inc with a backup in freelance

2781
08:06:13,900 --> 08:06:19,659
getting decent sleep while using hypnospace lazy bums who stay up late watching tv don't get good

2782
08:06:19,659 --> 08:06:25,419
sleep so what's your damn point in hypnospace they can talk to people and learn which helps brains a

2783
08:06:25,419 --> 08:06:33,930
lot not my point the doc said that look don't worry about it if people are tired after sleep time

2784
08:06:33,930 --> 08:06:39,049
just get on fewer nights per week people are responsible for their own choices too much ice

2785
08:06:39,049 --> 08:06:44,950
cream will kill you but no one does studies on that yeah hypnospace is like ice cream it's good

2786
08:06:47,750 --> 08:06:54,150
it's we who don't get sleep with these long streams this i know we're late we're late again

2787
08:06:54,150 --> 08:07:06,180
very late at night i mean he's beef braining us along with himself it's all right yeah hypnospace

2788
08:07:06,180 --> 08:07:10,979
is like ice cream it's good it's fine also it's our study it was privately commissioned by us so

2789
08:07:10,979 --> 08:07:17,750
it can just stay private the new pr guy suggested it as a way to deal with the beef brain rumors

2790
08:07:17,750 --> 08:07:23,400
we'll find some other way not a big deal good uh the report said that beef brain is fake right

2791
08:07:23,400 --> 08:07:29,080
that would be bad for pr if it was real and people's brains did that yuck not good for the evening

2792
08:07:29,080 --> 08:07:34,729
news i'm reading the afscar it's lots of big words i'm guessing you're still trying to get

to further determine effects of continued hypno space use until then we recommend discontinuing

best friend at the end there who is this who's making these my work consumed me and became me

2957
08:42:59,849 --> 08:43:04,490
people who weren't helping me build my masterpiece were invisible through all of it you were always

2958
08:43:04,490 --> 08:43:08,729
willing to come back and put up with my garbage and god i wish you hadn't i'm sorry this is dylan

2962
08:43:33,479 --> 08:43:40,810
the waterworks for a lot of us zane you could have become someone your mother was proud of

2963
08:43:41,610 --> 08:44:07,740
i'm sorry zane that was a backhanded compliment it's like i got one dollar what am i gonna spend

2964
08:44:07,740 --> 08:44:16,490
it on it turns out i didn't even like need these now but even after you're done there's still a

2965
08:44:16,490 --> 08:44:25,580
bunch of pages that i didn't really see that i skipped skim through you could probably spend

2966
08:44:25,580 --> 08:44:38,200
another there's at least probably another two or three hours of time at least to go through bwl

2967
08:44:38,200 --> 08:44:47,000
burst out laughing right play janitor for the next six hours no no no no uh that was a lot of

2968
08:44:47,000 --> 08:44:54,810
fun thanks for joining me i'll see you guys tomorrow tomorrow there's one of two options here

2969
08:44:55,450 --> 08:45:03,930
either we're gonna do space channel five or or uh then get a new game that came out on steam

2970
08:45:03,930 --> 08:45:09,049
that's co-op it's like a co-op story shooter called like was it rico i think it's called

2971
08:45:09,689 --> 08:45:18,790
space channel five is only like a couple hours long so i probably i need to put that somewhere

2972
08:45:18,790 --> 08:45:24,810
where that is the beginning or the end of the stream i'm actually really happy that i was able

2973
08:45:24,810 --> 08:45:29,580
to stay on for this long because before i turned the stream on i was sitting here thinking maybe

2974
08:45:29,580 --> 08:45:37,689
i'm not gonna peel the stream from within a couple hours but i feel okay so late tonight i know

2975
08:45:37,689 --> 08:45:46,500
thanks there was still a shit little people here all the way into like two three a.m eastern so

2976
08:45:46,500 --> 08:45:52,569
appreciate it i'm not gonna do vr for a little while until i'm not sure if anybody

2977
08:45:53,369 --> 08:45:59,849
how many of you guys were here at the beginning of the stream but i had a a massive catastrophic

2978
08:45:59,849 --> 08:46:07,450
exorcist like migraine there a few days ago and it shut me off for two straight days it fucked me

2979
08:46:07,450 --> 08:46:18,279
up bad so i'm kind of taking it easy i'm just happy i was didn't have a problem streaming today

2980
08:46:18,279 --> 08:46:28,340
so that means i'll probably be fine tomorrow actual beef brain yeah imagine getting irl beef

2981
08:46:28,340 --> 08:46:34,979
brain and then playing this game on accident what did i say blend up my brain and like piss on it

2982
08:46:34,979 --> 08:46:40,700
or something something like that well i'll see you tomorrow if you're coming we're going to do the

2983
08:46:40,700 --> 08:46:47,220
bits and the credits right at the end here i got a stamp of approval on this game this game was a

2984
08:46:47,220 --> 08:46:59,380
lot of fun and they were developers here and that's that's really cool you made an interesting uh

2985
08:46:59,380 --> 08:47:10,409
piece here so nice work let's see log off how much in-game time was it uh zero 21a

2986
08:47:11,209 --> 08:47:20,819
oh no that's a.m let's close that out and hey what do you know here comes the outro

2987
08:47:24,939 --> 08:47:29,659
i don't think we have two this bits aren't gonna take too long i don't think no this should be

2988
08:47:30,220 --> 08:47:39,619
maybe like 30 40 minutes all right let's start thank you to bake me home for the 250 get some

2990
08:47:46,840 --> 08:47:52,220
co-op lazy look thanks for the 250 by reading this message your body agrees to be perfectly

2991
08:47:52,220 --> 08:48:00,099
healthy for the next 300 years doctors hate me i wish it were that easy i wish it were that easy

2992
08:48:00,740 --> 08:48:05,700
but thank you uh foury thank you foury for the three bucks hey germa i was wondering if you

2993
08:48:05,700 --> 08:48:10,500
could do a movie night like star where you watched old videos with chat and gave behind the scenes

2994
08:48:10,500 --> 08:48:18,419
perspectives this stream is very relaxed trip down memory lane we've done some stuff like that before

2995
08:48:18,419 --> 08:48:26,409
before we sat there and watched random videos not as an entire stream though um

2996
08:48:29,270 --> 08:48:45,380
probably not maybe maybe maybe not for an entire stream i could do that for like an hour or so

2997
08:48:45,380 --> 08:48:49,220
just old videos that i maybe i'd want to re-watch or haven't seen in a long time

2998
08:48:50,020 --> 08:48:56,060
it's an interesting idea though you get carried away yeah you sit there for like six hours

2999
08:48:58,250 --> 08:49:01,689
star actually made a new video if you don't know star made a new basically video

3000
08:49:02,330 --> 08:49:14,099
just three years later it's just like bang here's another one uh it's pretty funny it's pretty fun

3001
08:49:14,659 --> 08:49:22,540
you'd probably like it imagine not uploading the same year as stars i don't have any plans

3002
08:49:22,540 --> 08:49:33,819
for any videos it was good but thank you for even three bucks and not immediately hey trust

3003
08:49:33,819 --> 08:49:39,259
no one thanks for the 250 hey germa good uh good you're in a better state now but during my long

3004
08:49:39,340 --> 08:49:43,500
ride through your archive streams i stumbled upon several occasions of you saying something

3005
08:49:43,500 --> 08:49:48,540
particular but most of it turned out to be something different later to be more precise

3006
08:49:48,540 --> 08:49:55,099
lies lots of lies i've collected some examples just to reveal the truth to chat i have to bring

3007
08:49:55,099 --> 08:50:01,180
this message to the people they must know justice must be served please don't be mad god damn it

3136
09:11:46,809 --> 09:11:50,730
no bits old man i've said about a thousand times but i really enjoy the fact that you regularly

3137
09:11:50,730 --> 09:11:55,610
stream for something like six hours or more and on that note do you ever get sick of streaming

3138
09:11:55,610 --> 09:11:59,610
or feel like you just don't want to play anything would you feel like playing a certain game that

3139
09:11:59,610 --> 09:12:11,779
you already streamed and don't because of it um no you gotta remember i i don't stream like a lot

3140
09:12:11,779 --> 09:12:20,250
of other people stream i stream four days a week sometime you know three or four days a week

3141
09:12:21,190 --> 09:12:25,830
i don't go hard every day i don't have the kind of the same game or the same content that i like

3142
09:12:25,830 --> 09:12:35,050
to do so i have time to not be streaming you know and have a life outside of streaming and

3143
09:12:35,690 --> 09:12:43,769
do other things and see other things and try to work on myself in the quotes right but i

3144
09:12:43,769 --> 09:12:49,129
don't ever feel like ah god here we go just gotta get your face on

3145
09:12:49,930 --> 09:12:56,389
huh huh huh fuck i don't want to fucking be here hey guys what's up man uh here we go it is time

3146
09:12:56,389 --> 09:13:05,830
for stream welcome everybody it's saturday because whenever i stream it's when i want to

3147
09:13:05,830 --> 09:13:17,180
and that goes with why did you get rid of the schedule because that's able to happen but i

3148
09:13:17,180 --> 09:13:23,660
i had the same exact mindset when i did youtube was i'm gonna do it when i know i want to and

3149
09:13:23,660 --> 09:13:28,949
when i know i can when i know that i want to put myself forward and have a level of energy and

3150
09:13:28,949 --> 09:13:32,949
know that i want to do something have something i would like to do and if i don't know what i'm

3151
09:13:32,949 --> 09:13:36,470
gonna do for a couple days in a row and i spend some time trying to figure that out then i'm not

3152
09:13:36,470 --> 09:13:43,349
gonna stream it's been like that since youtube i sometimes i didn't make a video for like five

3153
09:13:43,349 --> 09:13:46,870
or six straight days because it was like ah whatever let me figure out what i want to do

3154
09:13:54,580 --> 09:14:04,330
and i am forever grateful that there are a shitload of people on the internet that are that are okay

3155
09:14:04,330 --> 09:14:14,889
with that and think that that's interesting and like the stuff that's here you know i take that

3156
09:14:14,889 --> 09:14:28,980
incredibly seriously i take it very seriously so that long-windedly maybe opened um not opened

3157
09:14:28,980 --> 09:14:37,720
maybe that closed that question for you maybe but long story short when you see a stream turn on

3158
09:14:37,720 --> 09:14:44,279
it's because i wanted to turn it on and if a stream does not turn on it's because i didn't want to do

3159
09:14:44,279 --> 09:14:49,559
it for some reason either i wanted to break i wanted a day off i had something i wanted to do

3160
09:14:50,199 --> 09:14:56,919
i had the other year in real life shit i wanted to do so every time you see the stream turn on i

3161
09:14:56,919 --> 09:15:02,419
want to fucking be here it's part of the design so thank you so much for the incredibly

3162
09:15:03,459 --> 09:15:12,260
uh wonderful continued support and thanks with three bucks thank you fraudy and weapon for the

3249
09:29:26,580 --> 09:29:32,660
somewhere to sign stuff for my first job i'm kind of nervous not gonna lie i barely slept

3250
09:29:32,660 --> 09:29:35,779
something about the commitment that gives me worries any stories from your first job

3251
09:29:37,190 --> 09:29:46,410
here's the best thing about first jobs gives you a lot of good experience when you go to work for

3252
09:29:46,410 --> 09:29:52,970
the first time but first of all yeah congratulations hell yeah glad you got a first job that's good

3253
09:29:56,330 --> 09:30:08,169
you learn a lot and you'll take that wherever you go so the story of my first job ever um i

3254
09:30:08,169 --> 09:30:13,129
don't know if i was particularly nervous as much as i was i wanted to i wanted to do as good as a

3255
09:30:13,129 --> 09:30:21,690
job as i possibly could as long as you like you don't want to overwork yourself though

3256
09:30:22,489 --> 09:30:30,569
but just you know try to care about what you do people see it people can tell and if you don't

3257
09:30:30,569 --> 09:30:34,809
if you don't like what you do and if you're not enjoying it anymore if it's something like you

3258
09:30:34,809 --> 09:30:50,860
go to work you don't like it then try to transition to something else deep lore and it can be tough

3259
09:30:52,540 --> 09:30:58,459
i worked in i did a lot of substitute teaching i did a lot i know people again i think that's a

3260
09:30:58,459 --> 09:31:05,190
meme and it's a joke that was i think that's the only time i was really ever nervous

3261
09:31:08,169 --> 09:31:12,889
because i was responsible but on all the jobs i ever had i was never responsible for other people

3262
09:31:13,930 --> 09:31:18,250
and then when i started substitute teaching it was like okay now i'm responsible for other people

3263
09:31:18,970 --> 09:31:25,050
were you the cool not i was not the cool teacher i've talked about a couple of stories

3264
09:31:25,690 --> 09:31:32,949
when i used to sub need more stories about being a teacher i don't really have any

3265
09:31:33,750 --> 09:31:40,760
i was just handing out worksheets and making sure nobody did anything bad and you know answering

3266
09:31:40,760 --> 09:31:45,800
questions it really wasn't like oh i got some school of rock oh i turned into jack black and

3267
09:31:45,800 --> 09:31:56,059
i got a guitar no i i just kind of sat around and made sure people did their work and making the

3268
09:31:56,059 --> 09:32:06,629
teacher noise sometimes yeah but congratulations on your job snoozing copter happy to hear it
