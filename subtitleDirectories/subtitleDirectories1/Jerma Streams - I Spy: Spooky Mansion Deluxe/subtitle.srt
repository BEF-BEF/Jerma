00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:07,139

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,800

5
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,020

00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:56,710
Mansion, I spy it doesn't matter. What's the title? Do I have a shitty title? No, it's pretty good

7
00:00:57,229 --> 00:01:01,829
But I don't have a Twitter. How will I know?

8
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:06,189
Just open up Twitter right now and go to twitter.com slash German on a five

00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:10,680
You'll find me and then you can see what the streams happening

10
00:01:11,019 --> 00:01:17,500
All right. I this is how you can tell how fucking dumb I am while I was talking I typed into my Twitter

11
00:01:18,939 --> 00:01:29,040
WWW dot slash German nine eight five not even like a twitch. Hey, you know, they're getting rid of URLs

12
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:38,629
You know that right? That's the thing in like five to ten years guys. It's not gonna be

13
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:41,010
WWW.twitch.tv

14
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:44,069

What do I have for my head like dishwasher repairman window between three and four Pacific?

18
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,700
That's sometimes between two and four. Sometimes they come early

19
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,900
How's the search bar gonna work?

20
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:22,710
That's a question for a scientist and I am NOT a scientist I'm a tuber and a streamer

21
00:02:23,469 --> 00:02:30,169
so today

22
00:02:30,169 --> 00:02:32,979
we're going to play a

23
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:40,939
Requested game it is called I spy and the

24
00:02:42,259 --> 00:02:44,259
spooky mansion deluxe

25
00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:50,759
Should be fun. It is a hidden object game. This idea came about

26
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,560
during 700,000 games

27
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,879
We played a hidden object game and people were like

28
00:02:55,879 --> 00:03:01,770
Oh, you know what a great hidden object game is that you should just unironically do a real stream on is I spy

29
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:09,229
Here we are. I spy mountain blade

30
00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:16,990
Yeah, if you didn't watch the mountain blade stream last night just it was a great stream. I had a lot of fun

31
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:20,110
Just don't watch past like six and a half hours

32
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:22,629
Because I this is weird bug on twitch

33
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,629
Where I think there's like a bug inside that the browser where like, you know

34
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:29,789
You know, you the computer will crash if you watch past six and a half hours. I

35
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:47,650
Heard I've done it's only on that it's only on that one vaude. I don't know why like I think there's some kind of bug

36
00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:50,990
You can't watch it past six hours something like that

37
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:59,979
But anyways, let's get started here. That sounds I'm just kidding. It's not real

38
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:05,379
I had a fucking meltdown after like six and a half hours and I like I like called out chat

39
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:13,009
It was messy. But you know, I'm not perfect, you know, I'll be the first to tell you that

40
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:19,819
But we talk we talked it out we we hashed it out everything's all good

41
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:35,699
But I'm ready give people a little a few moments to trickle in here. Our marriage is saved

42
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:51,319
First chat experience. No, no, no, no, no. No. Here we go. How do I press this button? Which one is it?

43
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:53,879
Oh, right. I have to capture my whole desktop

44
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:58,879
So hopefully there's no like fucking probably there's no like bad folders on here

45
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:04,959
Like what's what's up? What could be on that folder is tax documents. No, I'm like serious like that. Hopefully that's not there

46
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:12,670
Like did recently do that. That's ten community subs from Maddie numbers

47
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,620
Thank you for the ten community subs

48
00:05:15,779 --> 00:05:23,529
Welcome everybody. So this is I spy

49
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:27,269
this game is very old and

50
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:29,860
I don't know first of all

51
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,860
I skipped the opening cutscene because I had to make sure I could capture the game and

52
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,180
What you missed here a really really whimsical scenario is scenario

53
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,620
I got in door and

54
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:45,870
Closed boom and there's no handle here. I can't open a door with no handle

55
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,870
See

56
00:05:54,310 --> 00:06:02,839
So I have to finish the puzzle and we've got some canes here and

57
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,759
Here's how you start the game. I'm gonna click the secret message behind the picture frame

58
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:13,879
Now this is a celebrated game and a celebrated franchise in a celebrated genre that doesn't exist anymore

59
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,079
Well, it does

60
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:20,779
This is probably at least four or five companies that try to scam your grandmother into buying these

61
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:30,139
But you know, I think it's a genre that could use some revitalization secret message

62
00:06:36,379 --> 00:06:38,379
It's all the countries in Europe

63
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:46,139
Here yet to earn puzzle pieces you have to go solve the I spy riddles and play the games that I've

64
00:06:47,779 --> 00:06:51,459
Okay, then come back here and put your pieces in place

65
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:56,620
It's uh, it's it's Europe. It's it's it's it's Africa

66
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:05,740
In the bathroom and by the sink there's a riddle for you to solve I think

67
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:08,579
Okay, go in the bathroom

68
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:22,139
So we're gonna we'll just go left to right, you know, I'm not gonna go right to left. What is this a manga?

69
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,319

70
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,120

Like that. Okay. Hold on. There's a cat all the stairs

79
00:08:19,689 --> 00:08:27,329
Cat doesn't do anything. This is one of those singing basses, right?

80
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:29,930

All right. How many yums do I have to click three?

Between they only had 15 minutes at the library and they like kept playing this

That's just pretty amazing that this game was

201
00:23:38,779 --> 00:23:44,059
Developed it was like a team of about five or six hundred people because it's back when each frame had to be frame by frame

202
00:23:44,059 --> 00:23:48,859
Put together animated and each piece was actually to frame by four. It was like five or six hundred person project

203
00:23:49,099 --> 00:23:54,859
The whole entire game cost about two hundred million dollars it was more I remember it was a huge deal at the time because the spider-man

204
00:23:56,180 --> 00:24:01,660
Broke the record never once spider-man one came out. It was like a two hundred million dollar budget. They passed to this game

205
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,940
It was like one hundred ninety eight million dollars or something

206
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:14,960
All righty a bone that's stone

207
00:24:17,529 --> 00:24:25,470

I don't smoke anything

211
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:47,039
Just wait till everybody sees the giant climax at the end of this game

212
00:24:56,599 --> 00:25:00,269

Fuck my life

218
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:30,650
Watch for the hint and figure out how these objects match

219
00:25:31,289 --> 00:25:36,089
Then empty the bins by clicking on the matching pairs. I missed everything she just said

220
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:39,660
Here's your hint

And actually yesterday too

268
00:29:16,829 --> 00:29:22,670
This almost it was going to be this or warband. This was like had almost 50 percent of the vote from the straw poll

269
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,039
And I asked hey

270
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:30,519
Is this like one of those like frog fractions game where it's like insanely hard and it goes crazy and like a bunch of

271
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:32,519
Weird stuff happens. Everyone's like don't tell them

272
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:45,000
Does that happen or is this just a game for like the third grade library? Is this like a he doesn't know scenario?

273
00:29:50,299 --> 00:29:52,299
Uh

274
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:06,190

00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:12,920
dangling spider

276
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,640
Okay, it was an old clip. I needed old clipper ship

277
00:30:20,329 --> 00:30:22,329
You lack critical information

278
00:30:25,549 --> 00:30:27,549
This game is hard as fuck

279
00:30:31,099 --> 00:30:33,099
I gotta be quiet because i'll eat these words

280
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:48,859
Clipper ship. Okay, so we clipper ship paper clip. We're gonna clip the theme here candle flame

I'm gonna put my hand up my mouth and be like, oh here's how you use powerpoint

285
00:31:09,549 --> 00:31:13,869
Good thing. I didn't do that because a bunch of people would have been like, excuse me. Not funny

286
00:31:14,829 --> 00:31:20,349
I didn't do that. I didn't make that joke. You can't hold it against me. That was the second match

287
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,799
An f in a frame

288
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:32,700
Excuse me, sir. That was not amusing. I didn't make the joke. I clearly stated

289
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,420
I preemptively stated

290
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:38,839
We see a bone

291
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:47,950
Three ducks

00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:50,990
This streamed comedy has been a two out of ten so far

293
00:31:52,109 --> 00:31:55,079
That's better than one. I'm glad you gave me a fucking two

294
00:31:57,130 --> 00:32:05,579
Imagine if it was a one

295
00:32:05,579 --> 00:32:07,420
All right. Let's see

296
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:17,710
trunk trunk

297
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:20,960
One match there's a match. Where's the other match?

298
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:25,920
All right. No, that's not

299
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:38,430
No, no

300
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:40,430

That could mean anything that doesn't have to mean like a skeleton bone

307
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:04,890
Yes, it does

308
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:09,559
What else could it possibly be?

309
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:15,880
Now it's one of the legs of the chair

310
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:27,289

That's a horseshoe bone. That's a that's a horseshoe bone. That's not a wishbone

339
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:46,190
It's going to be in the tree somewhere

340
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:48,190
No, that's a car air freshener

341
00:35:48,269 --> 00:35:57,000

342
00:35:57,559 --> 00:36:02,539

344
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:10,940

00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:45,639
I looked over and cheat somebody said sky thanos. Everything is thanos. We got we can't keep making thanos references

351
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,679
Okay, to be honest

352
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:52,199
Thanos references are becoming mario references of like two years ago

353
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:55,559
Remember I made a fucking mario reference every single stream for like a year

354
00:36:56,699 --> 00:37:02,219
Now it's thanos is in every game and it has to be an infinity war reference now every stream

355
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:09,440
And then it was a wow reference, right? Yep

356
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,639
That's true

357
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:16,940
I saw the fly

358
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:21,659
Fly morbid that's what gave this game a t rating

359
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:40,719
A half moon wishbone. Oh got a wishbone

00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:41,420
How about a doll that comes to life to like kill you?

506
00:49:42,219 --> 00:49:44,300
And like it's some fucking like kid with a bat

507
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:49,760
And the whole thing is a doll like peeking around corners and finding him and finally like the kid kid does a full wind up

508
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,079
And hits the doll in the fucking mouth with the baseball bat

509
00:49:53,179 --> 00:49:57,019
And like the ending frame is like the whole family like having dinner and they're all happy

510
00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:01,530
Oh, yeah, it's supposed to be a children's book children's book so

511
00:50:02,329 --> 00:50:03,210
uh

512
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:05,210
detective teddy the

513
00:50:06,409 --> 00:50:13,659
Teddy teddy's turmoil and it's like, oh no, he didn't take a bath today. I'm gonna make a million dollars tomorrow today

514
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:18,380
Okay, so we got foot with any three bows

515
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:29,369
Already, he's been stolen just replace it with any other animal like

516
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:31,610
mosey the mouses

517
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:35,289
Bath time shenanigans or whatever it could be anything

518
00:50:39,289 --> 00:50:46,909
Okay, I need to beat this game

519
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:50,190
That's called plagiarism. No, it's not

520
00:50:50,829 --> 00:50:53,789
If it's original i'm gonna make it original. It'll be so original

521
00:50:56,170 --> 00:50:58,170
Okay, I need a foot with no toes

522
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:05,150
This shit's gonna sell so many copies

523
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:12,510
Laugh now, but this will be in the front of every barnes and noble. It'll be a it'll sweep the nation

524
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:24,860
All right. I need um, this is getting hard an eye back in place

525
00:51:29,179 --> 00:51:34,219
An eye back in place here comes a copy. Imagine if I got like fucking sued

526
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:38,860
That's why I wrote a book and I didn't realize because like everybody's written a story

527
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:42,460
About some random stuffy fluffy character

528
00:51:43,019 --> 00:51:48,219
That like has trouble eating vegetables and like I get sued and I go to court and I lose everything

529
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:50,780
That would be

530
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:52,780
That would probably be fucking hilarious

531
00:51:53,579 --> 00:51:59,260
That's like the only way I would ever accept like literally like like my career like my stream youtube, whatever

532
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:02,059
It was all taken from me because I've like plagiarized a children's book

533
00:52:03,449 --> 00:52:05,050
like on accident

534
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:18,940
That's not a porcelain hand a porcelain head. Oh

00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,710
porcelain head

536
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:27,309
Local streamer throws away his livelihood to one up for one guy

537
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:35,320
This way we're gonna fucking write it man. It's gonna be like not it's gonna be like 10 pages long

538
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:43,000

539
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,440
Let me see a needle

540
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:57,019
No, it's gonna be so original that there's no way anyone would take it three bows a face with no eyes

541
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,639
face with no eyes

542
00:53:01,719 --> 00:53:03,480

543
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:07,579
Where's a face with no eyes?

544
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:11,469

550

Isn't that count?

551
00:53:30,809 --> 00:53:40,809
How does that not count?

552
00:53:40,809 --> 00:53:42,809
Foot with no toe. It's a ruler

00:53:44,889 --> 00:53:46,889
A foot with no toes

554
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:54,079
Animals have paws not feet

Where are they?

559
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:27,449
And then says the guy that foot paw. It's not paw print. It's footprint and that's clearly a paw

560
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:29,369
and then

561
00:54:29,369 --> 00:54:31,289
I got

562
00:54:31,289 --> 00:54:33,769

563
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,900

What people are wondering what i'm talking about i'm talking about game of thrones you're already done with number nine

580
00:56:12,730 --> 00:56:13,690
So

581
00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:22,090
What do you think of this puzzle of mine? I think it's all right

582
00:56:26,010 --> 00:56:28,010
Yeah game of thrones

583
00:56:28,329 --> 00:56:30,489
Still no, it's it's still still watchable

584
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:36,170
But I mean, can you blame them? The guy was supposed to write the next book

585
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:39,769
And just went to like conventions for five years

586
00:56:40,489 --> 00:56:46,119
Like the winds of winter is never releasing. I just everybody needs to know that

587
00:56:46,199 --> 00:56:48,699
I got it. You got to come to terms with it

588
00:56:51,469 --> 00:56:53,469
He was just like living the life

589
00:56:56,719 --> 00:57:01,199
Like I love that series. I've read all the books. It's like one of my favorite series ever

590
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:07,039
But I think I think I'd have to come to terms with the fact that like hbo is just going to finish that story

591
00:57:12,039 --> 00:57:16,920
And i'm one of those like bitter annoying book fans. It's like no the show's not good enough because it's been booked

592
00:57:17,159 --> 00:57:18,679
I like the books better

593
00:57:18,679 --> 00:57:29,760
Find the right you're literally finishing it in april

594
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:36,190

No, you know why you don't you know why you think I never read them

599
00:57:49,679 --> 00:57:51,679
I'll tell you one very specific reason why

600
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Because I've read all the books

601
00:57:54,969 --> 00:57:56,969
And that was like in 2011

602
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:00,940
There's almost it's 2019

603
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:06,079

A rat eye that's red a tea back in place a winner's cup a gyroscope

616

The winner's cup the winner's cup. That's not a winner's cup

630
01:00:20,639 --> 01:00:31,800

cinderbox

853
01:23:24,659 --> 01:23:26,260
portion of the

854
01:23:26,260 --> 01:23:27,140
scene

855
01:23:27,140 --> 01:23:29,140
Okay eggs. I found them

856
01:23:30,029 --> 01:23:32,029
Okay, I gotta fucking relax

857
01:23:33,859 --> 01:23:35,859
God damn it, man

858
01:23:36,020 --> 01:23:41,140
Sometimes I look over and and like something is said and fuck I do it throws me off forever

859
01:23:42,609 --> 01:23:46,609
This is this is the dreamcast sucks laughing my ass off comment all over again

860
01:23:47,569 --> 01:23:55,859
I want me to keep a hot dog in a jar. That's like a ballpark frank, by the way

861
01:23:57,699 --> 01:24:12,640
With the fake grill marks on it a bug in a spoon you return it a spoon in a bowl

862
01:24:17,649 --> 01:24:19,649
a bug in a spoon

863
01:24:21,119 --> 01:24:23,409
I spy spice

864
01:24:23,409 --> 01:24:25,970
Where's the spice?

865
01:24:29,359 --> 01:24:35,439
Spice it's weird way to say that. Okay bug in a stew

866
01:24:36,159 --> 01:24:40,000
a knife a four

867
01:24:40,079 --> 01:24:43,409
It was a knife a knife

868
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:46,079
knife

869
01:24:46,079 --> 01:24:48,060
a knife

870
01:24:48,060 --> 01:24:52,739
Streamer refuses to eat frank on stream

871
01:24:55,979 --> 01:24:57,600
no

872
01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:03,439
Do we ever talk about the the hot dog eating competition with kubayashi versus the bear?

873
01:25:04,699 --> 01:25:10,590
We've done that. We've talked about that, right?

874
01:25:10,750 --> 01:25:12,800
No, no, we haven't

875
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:14,800
It's like one of the funniest goddamn things

876
01:25:15,439 --> 01:25:20,560
So, uh, you know the the hot dog eating champion, right? So

877
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:26,239
This guy if you don't know who kubayashi is he used to he could eat like 75 hot dogs

878
01:25:27,630 --> 01:25:32,670
In like 10 minutes. It's ridiculous. It's the coney island hot dog eating competition

879
01:25:33,550 --> 01:25:38,430
And there's they did this segment. There was this old show called like man versus beast

880
01:25:39,069 --> 01:25:41,060
Or something like that

881
01:25:41,060 --> 01:25:45,859
And one of the segments they had like people that were extraordinary at certain things go up against animals

882
01:25:46,689 --> 01:25:51,810
And it's one side but kubayashi they brought him in to go do a hot dog eating contest versus a bear

883
01:25:54,180 --> 01:26:00,579
And it was supposed to be like this huge deal where kubayashi can't he out eat a fucking grizzly bear in

884
01:26:01,039 --> 01:26:04,500
25 seconds and you're thinking oh, this is gonna be interesting

885
01:26:05,310 --> 01:26:06,350
It's not at all

886
01:26:06,350 --> 01:26:11,630
What happens is kubayashi is like mowing down these hot dogs at two a second like drinking water

887
01:26:11,949 --> 01:26:15,539
It's sucking them down as fast as he can and the bear doesn't give a shit

888
01:26:15,539 --> 01:26:17,460
The bear doesn't know it's a competition

889
01:26:17,460 --> 01:26:21,939
So he doesn't care the bear like winnie the pooh moses over to the hot dog

890
01:26:22,020 --> 01:26:24,420
It's like there's like probably a hundred hot dogs laid out in front of this bear

891
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:31,260
and the bear just was like sniffing them and there's a timer and there's commentary and shit and the bear is just like

892
01:26:32,140 --> 01:26:35,020
Like tilts his head over and like sucks one up hole

893
01:26:37,569 --> 01:26:39,569
And then like starts smelling him again

894
01:26:41,569 --> 01:26:47,649
I think the bear only eats like fucking seven hot dogs. He doesn't give a shit and kubayashi eats like 60

895
01:26:48,590 --> 01:26:50,590
And they thought it was gonna be like good television

896
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:54,979
Uh, I gotta like fucking find this right now and put it on the stream

897
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:59,600
The bear like tilts his head and like

898
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:03,920
The thing is the bear knew it was a competition. He would eat a hundred hot dogs in like five seconds

899
01:27:04,479 --> 01:27:10,640
Let's see kobayashi versus bear

900
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:17,600
There it is

901
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:24,529
Yeah, and they got the break up bruce buffer to do like the fucking intro and they had the bear like scream

902
01:27:26,850 --> 01:27:31,890
Uh, I don't this is uh, excuse me ladies and gentlemen, i'll see you in about five seconds when I get this on stream

903
01:27:31,890 --> 01:27:33,489
We're gonna watch this whole thing

904
01:27:33,489 --> 01:27:40,989
I remember when this first aired I remember fucking laughing my ass off

905
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:46,380
It was like the funniest fucking thing i'd ever seen

906
01:27:47,020 --> 01:27:49,819
And we're well, let's watch it. The quality is so low

907
01:27:59,170 --> 01:28:03,729
All right, here we go. See he's like prepared. He's coming in like strong like doing like training

908
01:28:03,729 --> 01:28:06,130
He's got his water there like all these hot dogs. He's ready

909
01:28:12,750 --> 01:28:20,060
He descends from kodiak island alaska fully this beast stands over eight feet tall do the roar

910
01:28:21,100 --> 01:28:31,649
At one thousand sixty pounds of food in a 24-hour period, but he doesn't know it's a competition

911
01:28:39,569 --> 01:28:45,250
He has no fucking just go what he's hot dogs. Oh, yeah, the contest begins as soon as the bear eats the first

912
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:55,760
As many as they can is what both the bear is going for it as well. Look at that

913
01:29:06,640 --> 01:29:12,880
I saw a flash of fear for a second in kobe yashi's eye because he's never faced a competition like this

914
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:18,800
It's unbelievable. See how casual look at how many hot dogs kobe yashi has left. I don't see how

915
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:23,840
You can make this bear you gotta remember kobe yashi is an eating machine

916
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:27,840
He's got a formula down where he just goes never takes a break. He's steady

917
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:29,840
Right and he also as you can see michael

918
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:34,239
He has the water there because his mouth gets dry and it helps him digest the hot dogs

919
01:29:34,640 --> 01:29:40,159
Well kobe yashi is the greatest professional leader in the world. He's got this eating. Yeah, who thought this is a good idea

920
01:29:40,399 --> 01:29:45,199
It's one minute into the competition now kobe yashi is doing very well. The bear is is scooping them up

921
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,119
Obviously, it's got a very different approach to eating

922
01:29:49,119 --> 01:29:53,760
But see he looks away and he takes a break because he doesn't know it's a competition

923
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:58,560
He's just a natural eating machine and he'll he'll take the break look away. Look at the lights

924
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:03,840
Look at our cameraman while kobe yashi never stops. You can see that. Did I misremember this?

925
01:30:04,479 --> 01:30:07,520
Look how skinny kobe yashi is and look at the size of the bear

926
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:12,640
You know, I was really impressed when kobe yashi first came out. He's in great shape. You can tell he's an athlete

927
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:16,399
He's got great biceps and he's and he came out with a small stomach

928
01:30:16,399 --> 01:30:21,359
He won't leave with one but he's he's a fabulous looking athlete two minutes into the competition

929
01:30:21,439 --> 01:30:27,439
Kobe yashi is watching that bear like a hot that bear is definitely going through the hot dogs michael

930
01:30:27,439 --> 01:30:31,039
He is he is he's making a strong lead. I can't count in that dish

931
01:30:31,199 --> 01:30:34,239
Yes, he is and I cannot count them from the angle that i'm at right now

932
01:30:34,319 --> 01:30:38,000
But no, he doesn't win. He is in the lead. It looks like no he doesn't win

933
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:42,720
Very shortly the bear is now looking at kobe yashi. Do you believe that exactly?

934
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:46,960
He's being distracted. This is what kobe yashi hasn't missed the beat

935
01:30:48,079 --> 01:30:53,119
There's only maybe six seven hot dogs left and there it goes. Oh my god. There's only three hot dogs

936
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:56,560
Ow, what the fuck

937
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:02,560
There's only two hot dogs left. There we go. He's down the last one. She must know that's it

938
01:31:03,119 --> 01:31:04,560
No

939
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:06,560
He's done. I thought he

940
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,439
Has won

941
01:31:09,439 --> 01:31:12,100
The alaskan cruncher is our new champion

942
01:31:17,329 --> 01:31:19,329
I got that so wrong

943
01:31:19,569 --> 01:31:24,670
I'm here with civ martin the bear handler. Did you have any doubt?

944
01:31:25,069 --> 01:31:28,510
Well, you know when a bear comes in he's this bear is really hungry

945
01:31:28,590 --> 01:31:33,229
So when they come in like that, they're gonna chow right down, but I have to give it to him

946
01:31:33,310 --> 01:31:37,149
He really did a good job on keeping up with the bear. It was a real close race

947
01:31:37,470 --> 01:31:39,470
Were you afraid at all?

948
01:31:40,750 --> 01:31:42,750
No, the best part

949
01:31:43,470 --> 01:31:48,350
Seriously like okay, so he said he said the bear has six or seven hot dogs left

950
01:31:49,390 --> 01:31:52,109
And i'm remembering from like two decades ago

951
01:31:52,670 --> 01:31:57,949
That he only ate seven but the point still stands like watch what happens when the bear the bear the first hot dog

952
01:31:57,949 --> 01:31:59,949
That he eats is just so stupid

953
01:32:01,949 --> 01:32:06,350
He just like sneaks over and it's like oh he like tilts his head to the side he eats it

954
01:32:06,430 --> 01:32:09,390
Oh, it's so funny as soon as the bear eats the first hot dog

955
01:32:11,020 --> 01:32:14,670
It is under way it's like this

956
01:32:15,229 --> 01:32:17,039
Oh

957
01:32:17,039 --> 01:32:21,359
I i'm I so I so poorly misremembered that but that makes it funnier to be

958
01:32:22,420 --> 01:32:27,420
uh

959
01:32:27,420 --> 01:32:28,300
people

960
01:32:28,300 --> 01:32:30,300
Old tv was so dumb

961
01:32:30,859 --> 01:32:33,020
You know how much that segment probably cost

962
01:32:35,739 --> 01:32:40,939
Old shows back in like the late 90s early 2000s man. They used to just throw piss money into the garbage can

963
01:32:42,430 --> 01:32:49,140
Oh my god

964
01:32:49,140 --> 01:32:51,140
I fully erect a large bear

965
01:32:51,699 --> 01:33:01,680
I don't even know how we got there what we did

966
01:33:02,859 --> 01:33:04,859
That's one of my favorite television segments

967
01:33:06,159 --> 01:33:14,739
Now I got a fucking headache

968
01:33:14,819 --> 01:33:16,979
The bear really eats like seven hot dogs

969
01:33:17,779 --> 01:33:19,779
Oh, he eats them all actually

970
01:33:19,939 --> 01:33:21,869
all of them

971
01:33:21,869 --> 01:33:29,310
Handrail. All right

972
01:33:29,310 --> 01:33:31,310
Wait, what what are you what am I getting linked here?

973
01:33:41,039 --> 01:33:43,199
What that face is so ugly

974
01:33:44,529 --> 01:33:47,500
Look at this shit

975
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:49,739
Where did this even come from? When did I do this?

976
01:33:54,670 --> 01:33:57,390
I I book I don't even look human in this photo

977
01:33:57,949 --> 01:34:13,279
Hold on. Look

978
01:34:13,279 --> 01:34:15,279
I don't even look human

979
01:34:16,449 --> 01:34:18,449
I look like anybody ever have a gerbil

980
01:34:20,399 --> 01:34:21,920
Or or hamster

981
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:24,609
Remember they used to just stuff shit in their mouth

982
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:28,930
And hide it in their cheeks

983
01:34:28,930 --> 01:34:33,489
I don't that doesn't even look like the same person. That doesn't look like jeremy elbertson. That's not even me

984
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:41,920
You look like a bogdanoff

985
01:34:58,020 --> 01:35:10,300
What the fuck uh, all right, uh hidden object game, uh

986
01:35:12,590 --> 01:35:18,460
But that was like manned versus beast or whatever the hell it was. I had so many dumb shows like that

987
01:35:22,529 --> 01:35:24,850
Yeah, well the thing is he was really hungry

988
01:35:28,109 --> 01:35:34,880
Shape of a moon big bits. Oh shit. I did I missed him with 50 bucks

989
01:35:35,359 --> 01:35:41,199
Uh 50 dollars from g y h d h f e. Uh, thank you so much for the 50 dollars

990
01:35:44,270 --> 01:35:47,310
Huge money. Thank you. Speaking of hot dogs germa, what do you prefer?

991
01:35:48,670 --> 01:35:50,000

What?

993
01:35:52,029 --> 01:35:56,989
This is just throwing this throwing me off here speaking of hot. What do you prefer tits or ass?

994
01:35:57,550 --> 01:36:00,350
If you avoid the question or answer neutrally, I will assume you like

995
01:36:01,069 --> 01:36:03,069
hot, okay, um

996

Uh, well first of all, thanks for the 50 dollars. That's a huge amount of money second of all

997

Uh
