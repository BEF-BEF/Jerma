1
00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:08,560
What's going on? Why am I always late?

2
00:00:12,009 --> 00:00:12,609
Because I'm not ready.

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,550
That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it.

4
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,149
That's the only actually that's the only explanation.

5
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:21,649
That's it.

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,820
Why are you not ready?

7
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:26,219
I'm just not.

8
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,269
I'll sit down at like 350.

9
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:33,509
Make sure like OBS and everything is working well and make sure I'm capturing the right things.

10
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:36,899
I have to I don't have a drink or anything.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,700

00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,399
I can't just like turn the stream on without a drink.

13
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:41,329
I need my tea.

14
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:46,439
And then I take a sip out of the tea and I realized that like wow, that's really moving me a little.

15
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,079
That's yeah, I have to go to the bathroom.

16
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:51,280
I have to pee.

17
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,380
I got to comb my hair.

18
00:00:54,409 --> 00:00:56,009
Maybe that does my phone ring.

19
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,939
Is it mom calling?

20
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:01,710
I don't know.

21
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,849
I can't take I can't take mom's phone call on stream.

22
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,129
So it's okay.

23
00:01:10,129 --> 00:01:11,129
I have to have a decision here.

24
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,230
It's either okay.

25
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:15,030
I see mom's calling at like 355.

26
00:01:15,969 --> 00:01:20,670
Okay, if I don't answer this mom phone call, I can't talk to mom till like 10 11 12 o'clock tonight.

27
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:23,750
I got to talk to mom.

28
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,650
I got to answer mom's call.

29
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:25,849
I got to answer the mom's call.

30
00:01:25,849 --> 00:01:26,450
Of course I am.

31
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,379
I mean mom didn't call today.

32
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:34,689
What's going on?

33
00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:35,090
How are you?

34
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:36,959
Good to see you again.

35
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:40,260
We're gonna pick up where we left off last night.

36
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:43,739
Where's my okay.

37
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:44,939
Precisely.

38
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,340
Where's my chapstick?

39
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,159
I'll be right back.

40
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,659
See this is what I'm talking about.

41
00:03:07,939 --> 00:03:08,539
Okay, I got it.

42
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,509
He fell in the toilet.

43
00:03:10,509 --> 00:03:11,310
I actually did today.

44
00:03:14,009 --> 00:03:14,310
Funny.

45
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:18,509
That was like a plant from chat because I was going to talk about that for a second.

46
00:03:18,509 --> 00:03:19,210
It wasn't a big deal.

47
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:24,810
I didn't fall in the toilet, but I sat down on the.

48
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:27,509
Like the toilet rib cage.

49
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:32,090
Not the seat.

50
00:03:32,389 --> 00:03:36,389
The seat was up and I sat down on that rigid part.

51
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,060
I was in a hurry.

52
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:54,050
I almost wish I had the audio from this this whole thing because I made this old man sound.

53
00:03:54,250 --> 00:04:07,919
It was like, hey, it's like, hey, hey, because when I sat down, it just you don't you never you're never expecting that we as humans know the exact

54
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:16,459
distance from ass to seat and even one to two millimeters off your body goes into a panic mode.

55
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:28,370
Once you're not at that spot where you know, it's supposed to be all hell breaks loose and it's holy shit.

56
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,069
I'm going I'm sinking through the earth.

57
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:33,680
Then it hurts the shit hurt.

58
00:04:44,250 --> 00:05:02,259
I mean, I don't know why I'm not just like ground pounding down on the toilet, but it kind of it kind of hurts your ass distance must be crazy.

59
00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:04,360
No, it's not you guys know what I mean.

60
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:14,100
You hit that moment where you're not your ass is not on seat and you know, it's supposed to be and even if it's not even a tenth of an inch, you know it and

61
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,000
there's not you're already sitting down.

62
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So you're screwed.

63
00:05:22,459 --> 00:05:23,360
So we're going to play some demos.

64
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,560
We're going to do what we did last night.

65
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:27,160
Looks like the internet seems to be okay right now.

66
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:33,899
I'm glad that whatever route Twitch was Twitch was taking to my internet.

67
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm glad it's fine.

68
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,899
It ended up being fine last night too.

69
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:47,100
So let's cross our fingers here maintenance.

70
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,029
Yeah, your mic sounds goofy.

71
00:05:51,529 --> 00:05:52,230
It doesn't.

72
00:05:56,949 --> 00:05:58,550
My mic does not sound goofy.

73
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,639
You got a goofy ass mic.

74
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:05,839
This is what is in my voice.

75
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:08,879
You're talking about now.

76
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:09,779
You got me all freaked out.

77
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:15,660
I am going to start with a gloom would I'm very excited for this game.

78
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:21,389
This is by I think the dusk Dev had something to do with this.

79
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:27,199
They said that company was it called new blood very excited for this.

80
00:06:28,329 --> 00:06:34,240
They usually come out with very very good products and could we see a coveted

81
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:41,240
5v not 5v5 could we see the coveted 5 out of 5 we only gave one last night.

82
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:44,509
I got high hopes.

83
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:52,430
What was the second highest score I gave last night.

84
00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:55,660
Please clear your throat.

85
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,819
Oh no, it says please don't clear your throat.

86
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:00,920
Well, dude, my voice is fucked up.

87
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:07,129
It was a four.

88
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:08,029
What did I give them?

89
00:07:13,089 --> 00:07:13,990
What did I give that other game?

90
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,300
I'm ready to go.

91
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:16,699
Let's do it.

92
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,699
You should be able to hear it.

93
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:24,000
Let's move over here.

94
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,100
That's even going to work.

95
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:27,899
I hope so.

96
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:36,329
Hi, here's gloom would and here's me too.

97
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:37,540
I'm here.

98
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:43,160
You gave nine souls of four six.

99
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:46,860
What do they give that rhythm game that fighting kind of rhythm game?

100
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,459
What did I give that?

101
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,420
It's like a four or something.

102
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:55,759
I didn't give that three six.

103
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:56,560
I get a three nine.

104
00:07:58,069 --> 00:07:58,670
That wasn't fair.

105
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:02,980
That's like a four one.

106
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:04,709
That wasn't fair.

107
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,079
You hear you.

108
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:09,779
Can you hear this?

109
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,079
I was like coughing.

110
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,870
All right, gloom would I'm ready.

111
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:15,569
Here we go.

112
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:18,870
This is a demo for those of you don't know.

113
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:23,269

We get exclusive access to it as a steam community.

118
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:44,610
It's like difficulty.

119
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:48,629
Let's do I'm just doing half moon.

120
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,129
I'm not doing any of this other stuff.

121
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,639
Okay, brightness.

122
00:08:56,299 --> 00:08:57,700
Just go full bright.

123
00:09:01,169 --> 00:09:02,669
I can see both the moons.

124
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:06,370
Wait, what does it want me to do until the left image is not visible?

125
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:10,740
I always don't listen to this though, because I know that okay,

126
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,940
when the when the moon is not visible, that's oh wow.

127
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:13,840
It's really dark.

128
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,039
I always go at least a little bit more.

129
00:09:16,929 --> 00:09:18,529
I just I can't I can't see anything.

130
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:22,320
You're gonna break the immersion.

131
00:09:25,049 --> 00:09:26,549
Yeah, but I want to be able to see.

132
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:28,450
I think that's okay.

133
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,450
Just a little bit.

134
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,750
Okay, let's go for a second.

135
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,049
I thought that was way too much.

136
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,620
It was like I did way too much.

137
00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:41,970
Put the screen shake up.

138
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,850
See I'm saying this is why I did it.

139
00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:47,700
Can you how's the audio?

140
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,000
Can you hear it?

141
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,100
Well, is the audio good?

142
00:09:58,909 --> 00:10:01,889
Oh, there he is.

143
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:03,299
There he is.

144
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:08,429
WSD.

145
00:10:08,429 --> 00:10:08,830
Yep.

146
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,240
Turn off the lights.

147
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,440
It's the middle of the afternoon where I am.

148
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,340
It doesn't not gonna help.

149
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,240
It's not gonna do anything.

150
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:26,429
Tap F to pick up items hold F to manipulate items.

151
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:30,240
Apologies that I could not encounter you in person.

152
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:33,039
For now take this vial and find your way into the manor on

153
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:33,740
the Main Street.

154
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,840
I await your arrival.

155
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,149
Okay, in the manor on Main Street.

156
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:41,830
Use tab to open your inventory and health status.

157
00:10:42,429 --> 00:10:43,330
Oh, okay.

158
00:10:45,169 --> 00:10:46,470
It's kind of like a VR setup.

159
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:50,419
Okay, so I got a letter.

160
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,519
I've got a vitalizing tonic.

161
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,009
I don't want to inject that right now.

162
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:04,480
Tap F to open the door hold F to slowly open the door.

163
00:11:10,889 --> 00:11:13,490
Your visibility is affected by light and shadow.

164
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:14,789
All right.

165
00:11:23,629 --> 00:11:25,429
Hold space to Manta.

166
00:11:32,429 --> 00:11:36,889
Creepy because you're cautious of traversing on loud surfaces

167
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:38,289
hold left shift to sneak.

168
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:43,809
Okay, I need to go in the manor.

169
00:11:57,549 --> 00:11:58,049
An enemy.

170
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:02,360
Ooh, what's this?

171
00:12:09,309 --> 00:12:11,909

172
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:16,309
Oh, that's cool.

173

All right, let's go.

174
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:18,809
Cane sword jailhouse.

175
00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:21,110
This is not the manor but whatever doors locked.

176
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:24,399
I will have a sword now.

177
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,820
Can I sneak anywhere?

178
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,519
Can I break something?

179
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:30,019
Can I break this?

180
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,120
I can.

181
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:40,860
How do you crouch cheese?

182
00:12:51,360 --> 00:13:03,950
What is this money dead end sewer cheese?

183
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:13,860
Yeah dead end bullets dead end.

184
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:26,970
What do you have a shiny nose today?

185
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:37,350
I don't know.

186
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,750
My father was fucking Rudolph.

187
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:40,889
Get over it.

188
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,450
Now that would now that was funny.

189
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,379
All right, so I need a key to get in there.

190
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:01,480
Wait weapons can be drawn and holstered.

191
00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:03,730
Oh, okay.

192
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,909
This way some objects can be destroyed.

193
00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:15,679
Why would it say that?

194
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:27,789
Oh, save your progress.

195
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:29,769
Okay, saved.

196
00:14:31,669 --> 00:14:33,269
That's quick and painless.

197
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:33,870
I like it.

198
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,059
So there's guns in this game.

199
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:47,460
That's where I need a gun.

200
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,220
There's guns and there's also sprockets.

201
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:03,840
I get him.

202
00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:07,309
Oh shit.

203
00:15:07,309 --> 00:15:08,610
Okay, that's a dump this guy somewhere.

204
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:24,610
Don't I what I didn't want to do right mouse block incoming

205
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:25,210
melee attacks.

206
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:25,610
Where is he?

207
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,000
Where'd he go?

208
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,019
Weird.

209
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:38,820
Where is this guy?

210
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,539
Oh, there's the key to the jailhouse gone.

211
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:16,090
All right, you just shot that guy.

212
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:17,289
Yeah, I did.

213
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:18,289
All right.

214
00:16:18,289 --> 00:16:18,690
I got the key.

215
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,649
You did nice stealth.

216
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:33,450
I stealthy shot that guy when he came down the stairs.

217
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,179
Can you throw stuff?

218
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:42,720
There's got to be a way right?

219
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:44,570
Yep.

220
00:16:44,769 --> 00:16:45,169
Okay.

221
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:47,470
I let him give me one of these here the box.

222
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:03,169
Anything else in here?

223
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,019
Okay, so I have the key that that's goes to the jailhouse,

224
00:17:12,019 --> 00:17:12,319
right?

225
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,990
So somebody said why are you acting like you're playing

226
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:24,789
Minecraft?

227
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,109
I'm I'm not.

228
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,299
Oh God.

229
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:36,299
Oh my God.

230
00:17:43,869 --> 00:17:45,069
Now say the bullets just hide.

231
00:17:51,289 --> 00:17:52,190
Did you see me?

232
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:53,789
I don't think you saw me right?

233
00:17:53,789 --> 00:18:00,859
No, don't step on the grate.

234
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,640
Oh my God, he shot me in the head.

235
00:18:19,779 --> 00:18:29,130
Okay, there's something in my nose.

236
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:37,279
It appears that something needs to be placed into this.

237
00:18:39,769 --> 00:18:39,970
Dude.

238
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:41,369
I have I got these right.

239
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:49,369
Oh, no, it's an that's a the wrong whatever.

240
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,900
All right guard house.

241
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,690
This door is locked shit.

242
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:02,500
I didn't be pulled through fences and oh.

243
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:09,259
Okay, nice here.

244
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,930
Oh, what?

245
00:19:18,029 --> 00:19:18,529
Oh my God.

246
00:19:18,529 --> 00:19:30,190
It was I'm gonna die.

247
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:37,890
We're good.

248
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:40,900
Dork mic.

249
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,500
I'm sorry.

250
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,900
My mic is a fucking dork.

251
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,500
I'm sorry.

252
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,900
I turned it on stealth game.

253
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,900
Yeah, I know.

254
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,500
I don't know.

255
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,799
I'm not very good at stealth games.

256
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,579
I didn't think I didn't know the window is right there.

257
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,400
Oh cool.

258
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,400
What does that do?

259
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:26,420
The men managed to confiscate one of the seals required to negate

260
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,420
the dark magics blocking ladies Sylvia's doors.

261
00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:32,920
We've reason to believe the foreigner is planning to take refuge

262
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,019
within the countess's high walls.

263
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,470
The seal has been placed in the jailhouse evidence locker.

264
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,670
Okay, seal house evidence locker.

265
00:20:44,589 --> 00:20:48,519
Okay, so I got jailhouse got it.

266
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,420
I got my task.

267
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,420
I got I know what I need to do.

268
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:55,980
Lean against doors to hear behind them.

269
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,279
Really?

270
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,019
Oh wait, somebody was in the bathroom and it is not here anymore.

271
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:12,410
Because when I shot the gun downstairs, they they all came out.

272
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:22,690
Okay, so we need to go to the jailhouse.

273
00:21:24,269 --> 00:21:26,069
I need to do I need a key for the jailhouse?

274
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:43,440
Whatever guard house.

275
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,299
All right.

276
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:46,400
I need the two seals.

277
00:21:54,509 --> 00:21:56,809
Remember to return to the phonograph to save the city of

278
00:21:56,809 --> 00:21:59,109
gloom would only gets more dangerous from here.

279
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:02,509
Oh no, I don't remember where the phonograph is.

280
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,599
Where's the phone?

281
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:06,400
Where's the phonograph?

282
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,299
This game goes hard.

283
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:21,240
Isn't it?

284
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:21,940
It's in here, right?

285
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,440
I missed a shotgun.

286
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:38,130
Did I actually miss miss the shotgun?

287
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:45,970
I did.

288
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:46,769
Holy, I thought you were lying.

289
00:22:46,869 --> 00:22:47,170
Okay.

290
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,299
So now I gotta go.

291
00:22:58,299 --> 00:22:58,599
I don't know.

292
00:22:58,599 --> 00:22:59,900
Where's the where's the safe thing?

293
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:13,920
Way too dank.

294
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,319
I'm sorry.

295
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:17,119
I put a limiter on the mic too and I can't doesn't fix it.

296
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,940
We'll do some tests on it in a minute.

297
00:23:37,779 --> 00:23:38,380
Where'd that guy go?

298
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,480
Oh fuck.

299
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,359
If I lean out, can they see me?

300
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:47,759
Can this guy that it's can that guy see me when I do that?

301
00:24:17,779 --> 00:24:19,380
What I did a backstab.

302
00:24:19,779 --> 00:24:20,779
Did I just do a backstab?

303
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,279
I thought I just backstabbed him.

304
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:26,650
Oh, it has to blink.

305
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:27,750
Okay, it has to blink.

306
00:24:32,049 --> 00:24:32,549
I get it.

307
00:24:34,789 --> 00:24:35,690
Nice face stab.

308
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:36,690
That was a backstab.

309
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:37,690
It just didn't register.

310
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,079
What can you do with the money?

311
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:50,559
Wait, hold on.

312
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,759
Did the dev say this demo is so old and crusty?

313
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:56,160
Did the dev say the demo is old and crusty?

314
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:00,799
What?

315
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:06,170
Wait, the dev came in here and said, oh God, this demo is so

316
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:07,470
old and crusty.

317
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:09,069
I think it's good.

318
00:25:10,099 --> 00:25:12,200
It's an old build compared to what they're working on now.

319
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:21,980
I don't think it's crusty.

320
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,180
What do you mean crusty?

321
00:25:25,369 --> 00:25:25,670
All right.

322
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:26,769
Here's a power station.

323
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:29,269
Can I do a force pull on it?

324
00:25:38,849 --> 00:25:40,049
All right, power station.

325
00:25:44,289 --> 00:25:45,890
Jeremy, you're old and crusty too.

326
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:46,690
Yeah, so it's fine.

327
00:25:47,789 --> 00:25:48,589
All right, relax.

328
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:05,380
Hey guys, if that was in the game, wouldn't it be better?

329
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:26,450
Where's this person?

330
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:45,099
Trying to distract him.

331
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,160
Okay, I don't know.

332
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,359
Why do I even sneak?

333
00:27:06,259 --> 00:27:07,660
But I even why would I even be sneaking?

334
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,660
I'm just crouching around shooting people with a shotgun.

335
00:27:10,059 --> 00:27:11,460
Why wouldn't I just shoot them?

336
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,759
Just shoot them.

337
00:27:20,299 --> 00:27:20,900
Is this a gun?

338
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:25,869
This is the third broken rifle this week.

339
00:27:27,069 --> 00:27:27,970
It's a stealth game.

340
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:30,369
I'm not good at stealth games.

341
00:27:35,109 --> 00:27:37,710
I don't some of you guys want to make like a big blueprint

342
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:39,109
before you get in the level and be like this is where I'm

343
00:27:39,109 --> 00:27:40,910
going to go and that X right there.

344
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,609
That's where I'm going to stay for five minutes.

345
00:27:42,609 --> 00:27:44,809
I'm going to go cook pasta and come back and then when the

346
00:27:44,809 --> 00:27:46,910
guy makes his rounds, I'm going to go sneak behind him do

347
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:49,009
one tap on his head and then this exit.

348
00:27:49,009 --> 00:27:51,809
No, I'm my brains too small to do that.

349
00:27:52,009 --> 00:27:52,710
I can't do that.

350
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:57,299
The shotgun ammo is very rare.

351
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:03,950
Like so you guys have some of you guys are very meticulous

352
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:06,950
and you want to plan out your routes and that's fun and

353
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:07,750
that you can do that.

354
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,750
You can do that in your game, but I want to throw a bottle

355
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:10,849
at somebody's face point blank.

356
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:18,519
Oh shit and hey guess what do we both get to the end of

357
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:27,559
the level see me walking around going like this and you

358
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:31,519
like sneaking around and like we both get to the end of

359
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:32,920
the level it and we both get it.

360
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,119
We both get a passing grade.

361
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,779
I don't want to hear it.

362
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:51,009
Okay, that's what that's one another gun.

363
00:28:52,380 --> 00:29:02,079
This is dual welding 2.6 GPA.

364
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:02,579
Yeah.

365
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:11,660
Okay, so I got that is the key.

366
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:15,950
What that what key is that for does it say warden court

367
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:20,799
key for the door near the jailhouse shotgun?

368
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,900
I got a lot of ammo cheese.

369
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,500
Oh eat this.

370
00:29:26,329 --> 00:29:26,829
That's it.

371
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:33,400
I just ate five wheels of cheese.

372
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:46,160
Okay, so I now the door near the jailhouse.

373
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:52,019
I got one of the Resident Evil puzzle piece stones.

374
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,539
So the dev is here, right?

375
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:09,539
Well, when are you going to add the breadcrumb the golden

376
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:12,539
breadcrumb trail that goes of GPS to where I need to go?

377
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:15,799
I thought that was going to be in the game.

378
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,400
I was like, so I was kind of convinced it was I don't know

379
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,000
why it's not here.

380
00:30:21,289 --> 00:30:22,289
I'm like, I don't want to die.

381
00:30:22,289 --> 00:30:26,059
I don't really want to say I'm disappointed but I mean

382
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:28,720
whatever it's now whatever.

383
00:30:28,819 --> 00:30:30,519
Sorry, I'm sure that they'll add it later.

384
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:36,480
I think that just scared the shit out of me.

385
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,579
I thought I was going to get zapped by Darth cities.

386
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:40,950
I just thought I thought a guy was sitting there.

387
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:42,450
We're just waiting for me with hands.

388
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:42,950
I don't know.

389
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:43,650
I just made it up.

390
00:30:46,059 --> 00:30:47,160
Okay, let's put this in.

391
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,660
I need one art jailhouse.

392
00:30:50,859 --> 00:30:51,759
It's back this way.

393
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,240
It's kind of near the beginning, isn't it?

394
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,880
Are you going to save the game yet?

395
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,400
I mean you might need save points.

396
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:12,740
I'm a hardcore gamer though and we didn't have save points

397
00:31:14,029 --> 00:31:17,730
when you got to level five in the Lion King on Super Nintendo

398
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:19,930
and when you lost you had to do the whole game over again.

399
00:31:22,859 --> 00:31:23,660
That's what I was used to.

400
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,200
Okay, let me go down here.

401
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:35,230
Wait, should I wait this is different.

402
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:36,430
Okay, I'm going to get this right.

403
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:45,529
This is completely inaccurate.

404
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:46,829
I'm not I don't look good at this.

405
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:48,470
You know what I am good at?

406
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:50,369
I'd walk around the corner be like, excuse me, sir.

407
00:31:50,569 --> 00:31:51,269
How are you?

408
00:31:51,269 --> 00:31:52,769
Oh, my name.

409
00:31:52,769 --> 00:31:53,670
Can I please shake your hand?

410
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:54,569
I would like shake his hand.

411
00:31:54,569 --> 00:31:58,039
We talk like I'm the guy that distracts the guards.

412
00:31:58,039 --> 00:32:00,740
I'm not the guy that sneaks into the castle.

413
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,539
I'm the one that walks up and does like a goofy routine

414
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:07,240
and distracts the guards while I do like magic tricks for them

415
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,539
and then laugh and clap and stuff.

416
00:32:08,539 --> 00:32:11,039
And then the main character gets to go into the castle

417
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:13,240
and then guess what I get to go home.

418
00:32:13,339 --> 00:32:14,440
I get to go home after that.

419
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,220
I did my job.

420
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:34,799
Okay, they didn't see that good.

421
00:32:41,809 --> 00:32:54,980
Oh God, it looked cool.

422
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,579
It looked cool.

423
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:07,349
He's a jester.

424
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:10,309
What do you guys think?

425
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:12,109
Okay back in old medieval times.

426
00:33:12,109 --> 00:33:13,509
What do you think I would be?

427
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:15,480
I don't know.

428
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,779
Everybody has this thing in their mind.

429
00:33:16,779 --> 00:33:19,079
No, I'd be the sword wielding hero.

430
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,079
No, no, I wouldn't.

431
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,299
I would be dancing around the dinner table.

432
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,259
You'd be dead.

433
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:28,059
No, I wouldn't.

434
00:33:32,769 --> 00:33:35,170
I'm not going to be the guy with the, you know, the rape here.

435
00:33:35,569 --> 00:33:35,970
Like...

436
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:39,170
Oh, please.

437
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:39,569
No.

438
00:33:52,809 --> 00:33:54,210
Did you have a Red Bull today?

439
00:33:55,339 --> 00:33:56,539
I don't drink Red Bull.

440
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,839
I'm just a fucking weirdo.

441
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,140
I think.

442
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:00,839
I don't know.

443
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:04,369
No, I'm not even a weirdo.

444
00:34:04,769 --> 00:34:05,569
You're the weird ones.

445
00:34:05,569 --> 00:34:06,069
Not me.

446
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:13,320
You're the town fool.

447
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,019
Is my head too...

448
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,320
Can you see me?

449
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:22,960
Copium.

450
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,960
I'm just kidding around.

451
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:28,949
Yeah, I would not be the...

452
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:31,679
No, I'm not going to be the hero.

453
00:34:35,309 --> 00:34:35,909
Don't turn around.

454
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:36,510
Don't turn around.

455
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:37,110
Don't turn around.

456
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:37,710
Don't turn around.

457
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:38,309
Don't turn around.

458
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:38,909
Don't turn around.

459
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:39,610
Don't turn around.

460
00:34:44,630 --> 00:35:11,900
All right, nice.

461
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,199
Cistern entry.

462
00:35:21,659 --> 00:35:22,960
You want to relive the Lion King?

463
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,760
He walked by the save room like three times.

464
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,719
Nobody wants to relive the Lion King.

465
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:33,920
No one.

466
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:41,610
That was so off.

467
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:44,309
I was trying to arc that so badly that it was going to hit him in the head

468
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:45,610
and it was completely off.

469
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:47,690
Somebody's coming.

470
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:48,090
Somebody's coming.

471
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:48,690
Somebody's coming.

472
00:35:49,889 --> 00:35:50,489
Somebody's coming.

473
00:35:50,489 --> 00:35:52,090
Somebody's coming in the room right now.

474
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,619
Despises that the Lion King is not good.

475
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:13,030
Where is this guy?

476
00:36:14,409 --> 00:36:15,309
Did he not come up here?

477
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:18,380
The Lion King...

478
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,679
The movie is fine.

479
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:21,780
The video game was just hell on Earth.

480
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:39,380
What did you guys think I was talking about?

481
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,820
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

482
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,619
Did you guys think I was talking about trying to watch through the

483
00:36:48,619 --> 00:36:53,099
Lion King movie and there's no save points?

484
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:58,250
What am I going to go make?

485
00:36:58,849 --> 00:36:59,449
Wait, what?

486
00:36:59,449 --> 00:37:00,449
What are you talking about?

487
00:37:01,809 --> 00:37:05,110
I'm talking about the Lion King, the video game for the SNES.

488
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:05,510
That's what I...

489
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:06,010
Wait, why?

490
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:07,309
I think you guys are getting confused.

491
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,679
I said game like three times.

492
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:21,880
Yeah.

493
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,679
Ooh, lantern.

494
00:37:24,449 --> 00:37:25,250
Oh goodness.

495
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,329
Does this cost oil?

496
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:29,519
It probably does.

497
00:37:36,349 --> 00:37:37,650
Fully visible to enemies.

498
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,260
Does that mean I'm invisible to enemies in the dark?

499
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,420
That's kind of what that means, right?

500
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,179
I'm fully visible, but not right now.

501
00:38:00,179 --> 00:38:00,780
Is there a bottle?

502
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:01,480
Give me this.

503
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:11,119
I think a bug just blew in my eye and it probably was on camera.

504
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,579
How do I get him to open the door?

505
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:25,059
There's a little entrance over there in the wall.

506
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,699
Should I follow him?

507
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:36,059
If I aggro him, will he come out somehow?

508
00:38:41,349 --> 00:38:42,150
All right, come on then.

509
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:42,650
Get out here.

510
00:38:43,969 --> 00:38:44,670
Come and get me then.

511
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:46,170
Come open the door and come get me.

512
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:50,400
All right, where's he going?

513
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:00,699
Can I turn this off?

514
00:39:07,449 --> 00:39:07,750
I don't know.

515
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:27,130
Huh?

516
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,179
Oh God.

517
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,179
These...

518
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,079
Oh, these are freshly fired.

519
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:36,980
All right, give me the shotgun.

520
00:39:47,329 --> 00:39:50,329
What the fuck is that sound that I just heard?

521
00:39:50,329 --> 00:39:51,730
What the fuck was that sound?

522
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:54,030
What the hell was that sound?

523
00:39:55,099 --> 00:39:56,400
That was horrifying.

524
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:00,630
Oh, I hate this.

525
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:12,340
Was it in front of me?

526
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:12,639
Was it...

527
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,079
Was it in front of...

528
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,179
Was it right in front of me?

529
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:15,679
And it's just...

530
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:16,380
There was no light?

531
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:20,500
I think...

532
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,500
I literally think I was looking at it.

533
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,099
I think I was looking at it and it was dark.

534
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,280
Oh goodness.

535
00:40:35,889 --> 00:40:36,389
Is it me?

536
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:38,789
That wasn't me.

537
00:40:39,289 --> 00:40:40,090
That wasn't me.

538
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:40,989
That was not me.

539
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,480
Safe point.

540
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:03,800
I got it.

541
00:41:10,059 --> 00:41:10,760
Storage.

542
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:12,500
Door control.

543
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:15,530
What?

544
00:41:15,929 --> 00:41:16,630
What the hell was that?

545
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:22,360
What?

546
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:24,659
This is a weird thing over there.

547
00:41:42,039 --> 00:41:42,440
Okay.

548
00:41:42,739 --> 00:41:43,340
Okay.

549
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:43,840
Okay.

550
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:45,139
There's the thing there.

551
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,820
It's like a fucking bird.

552
00:42:01,969 --> 00:42:04,070
Can I kill this in one hit with a backstab?

553
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:05,170
I need a DEV confirmation.

554
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,980
I need a DEV confirmation.

555
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,039
Oh shit.

556
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,940
Will it see me right here?

557
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:24,699
It won't see me right here, right?

558
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:25,599
Will it see me right?

559
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:27,400
I need to DEV post on Twitter right now.

560
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:28,699
Will it see me in this dark?

561
00:42:28,699 --> 00:42:29,400
DEV post on Twitter.

562
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:29,900
Will it see me?

563
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:53,389
Where the fuck am I?

564
00:42:54,329 --> 00:42:54,829
Okay, right here.

565
00:42:54,829 --> 00:42:55,429
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

566
00:42:55,429 --> 00:42:55,929
Storage.

567
00:43:00,929 --> 00:43:02,230
It's not coming over here, right?

568
00:43:04,219 --> 00:43:05,119
What the hell was that over there?

569
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:05,719
There were eyes over there.

570
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:06,119
What the...

571
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:06,920
Relax.

572
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:08,019
No, that's not eyes.

573
00:43:09,159 --> 00:43:09,960
No, no, no, no.

574
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:10,659
Get out of here.

575
00:43:10,659 --> 00:43:11,860
Get the fuck out of here.

576
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,880
There's one in the room right now.

577
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:21,469
Is there?

578
00:43:28,269 --> 00:43:28,969
No, just put it down.

579
00:43:28,969 --> 00:43:29,269
Put it down.

580
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:46,090
2010 YouTuber reaction.

581
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:48,289
DEV said, yeah, backstab it.

582
00:43:48,289 --> 00:43:48,690
It works.

583
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:55,760
2010, man.

584
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,460
I'm traveling back in time.

585
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:01,050
Is there two?

586
00:44:01,349 --> 00:44:02,250
I think there are two.

587
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,300
I think there are two.

588
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:10,579
This sucks.

589
00:44:36,949 --> 00:44:37,949
No, no, no.

590
00:44:37,949 --> 00:44:49,940
I'm sorry.

591
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:51,139
It's fucking 2010.

592
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:52,739
I'm sorry.

593
00:44:57,710 --> 00:45:01,889
Okay, that wasn't that bad.

594
00:45:01,889 --> 00:45:03,090
Okay, they die in like one hit.

595
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:03,989
They die in one hit.

596
00:45:04,489 --> 00:45:04,989
Two hits.

597
00:45:06,019 --> 00:45:07,519
Your mic sucks, dude.

598
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,019
I'm fixing it right now.

599
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:10,119
I'm pausing it.

600
00:45:10,119 --> 00:45:11,019
I'm fixing it right now.

601
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:11,820
You tell...

602
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:12,619
Look, here we go.

603
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:13,420
I'm fixing it.

604
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:14,119
You ready?

605
00:45:14,119 --> 00:45:15,119
My mic sucks.

606
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:15,920
Hold on, give me a second.

607
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,219
I swear to God, this is gonna take two minutes.

608
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:19,610
Okay, here we go.

609
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:20,010
Ready?

610
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:24,030
Here we go.

611
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:27,159
You tell me when it's better.

612
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:31,079
Oh, oh my God, bro.

613
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,280
Oh my God.

614
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:32,780
Is that better?

615
00:45:34,039 --> 00:45:35,239
Oh my God, bro.

616
00:45:35,239 --> 00:45:37,239
Whoa, what the fuck is happening?

617
00:45:37,639 --> 00:45:38,039
Better?

618
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:39,500
Is that better?

619
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:47,150
Dude, what the fuck?

620
00:45:47,349 --> 00:45:48,750
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

621
00:45:53,869 --> 00:45:54,769
Second one's worse.

622
00:45:58,449 --> 00:45:59,150
First one better.

623
00:46:00,969 --> 00:46:01,670
So this one right here.

624
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:02,570
This one, this is pretty good.

625
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:04,739
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

626
00:46:04,739 --> 00:46:05,539
Easy, easy, man.

627
00:46:05,539 --> 00:46:05,940
Easy.

628
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:07,539
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

629
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:07,940
Better?

630
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:16,980
It's crunchy.

631
00:46:17,849 --> 00:46:19,150
I can't, I don't think I can make it not...

632
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:21,050
I mean, I'm yelling into a microphone.

633
00:46:23,199 --> 00:46:24,699
Nice fucking eye exam, dude.

634
00:46:30,039 --> 00:46:30,840
Stop screaming.

635
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:31,739
I can't help it.

636
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:36,710
I'm an overreacting YouTube Andy.

637
00:46:36,809 --> 00:46:37,210
Okay.

638
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:38,409
I, that's not going to change.

639
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,000
All right, let's go.

640
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:42,699
I think that's in a better spot than it was last time.

641
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:43,199
All right, let's go.

642
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:43,400
Let's go.

643
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,199
Let's go, go, go, go, go.

644
00:46:45,699 --> 00:46:46,400
That's, that's better.

645
00:46:46,699 --> 00:46:47,000
We're good.

646
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:47,400
We're fine.

647
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:47,800
Everything's fine.

648
00:46:58,630 --> 00:46:59,329
This one's worse.

649
00:46:59,329 --> 00:47:00,130
How is this one worse?

650
00:47:01,829 --> 00:47:03,329
Dude, you need to get a blue Yeti.

651
00:47:09,139 --> 00:47:12,739
I remember those were, those were all the rage back in 2010.

652
00:47:13,969 --> 00:47:15,070
A blue Yeti.

653
00:47:15,369 --> 00:47:17,769
No, a blue snowball was the big one, right?

654
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:20,809
Dude, every single person had a blue snowball.

655
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:25,309
If you could buy stock in the blue snowball company back in

656
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:31,110
like 2008 and just sell it in 2012, you, you probably would

657
00:47:31,110 --> 00:47:33,409
have made a fucking shitload of money if that was actually,

658
00:47:33,409 --> 00:47:34,710
if they were actually publicly traded.

659
00:47:36,289 --> 00:47:36,989
I swear to God.

660
00:47:36,989 --> 00:47:39,289
I think every human being that was in front of a computer

661
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:40,789
in 2010 had a snowball.

662
00:47:42,539 --> 00:47:43,340
And let's be honest.

663
00:47:44,139 --> 00:47:44,940
They worked great.

664
00:47:46,489 --> 00:47:47,690
They were cheap.

665
00:47:47,889 --> 00:47:49,590
They weren't that expensive and they just plugged it in

666
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:50,090
and it was ready.

667
00:47:53,199 --> 00:47:53,400
All right.

668
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,400
What did I, did I complete my task here?

669
00:47:59,639 --> 00:48:03,750
The blue snowball is still kind of good, but every single

670
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:04,750
fucking person had one.

671
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,800
Oh dude, when they came up with the blue Yeti pro.

672
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:11,489
Oh yeah.

673
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:15,000
Hey, I'm going to get that one.

674
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:16,400
I want to sound like a pro.

675
00:48:19,949 --> 00:48:22,250
Yeah, I've used the snowball before.

676
00:48:25,619 --> 00:48:26,420
It works great.

677
00:48:30,429 --> 00:48:30,630
All right.

678
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:31,429
Am I doing this right?

679
00:48:32,429 --> 00:48:33,429
I got, well, I can read.

680
00:48:33,429 --> 00:48:33,829
Let me read.

681
00:48:39,099 --> 00:48:39,500
Apologies.

682
00:48:39,699 --> 00:48:40,699
Oh wait, I already saw this one.

683
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:42,300
So what is this thing?

684
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:47,050
It's like a crank.

685
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:55,440
What does this go?

686
00:48:58,710 --> 00:48:59,409
Is there a crank?

687
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:02,380
Excuse me.

688
00:49:08,889 --> 00:49:10,289
Do you remember the movie Crank?

689
00:49:12,539 --> 00:49:16,239
If the guy's heartbeat of his heart rate went down to a

690
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:19,239
certain beats per minute, his heart exploded.

691
00:49:23,059 --> 00:49:24,760
What a fucking hilarious movie.

692
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:26,639
All right.

693
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:27,539
Should I put it on here?

694
00:49:31,059 --> 00:49:31,960
Okay, main canal.

695
00:49:33,619 --> 00:49:34,619
Yeah, this is the movie.

696
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:36,920
If you guys, if you guys didn't know the movie Crank,

697
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:40,159
it's a movie about a guy who gets some type of like drug

698
00:49:40,159 --> 00:49:42,860
or something injected into him or he has like a fake heart

699
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:43,460
or something.

700
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:44,760
They give him a fake heart.

701
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:45,760
That's like an electrical.

702
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:46,059
I don't know.

703
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:48,260
I don't even know what the plot of the movie is.

704
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:52,460
All I know is it's like the movie Speed where you know,

705
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:54,360
in the movie Speed, you have to go a certain miles per

706
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,760
hour on the bus.

707
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:58,860
This guy had to keep his heart rate up if it went underneath

708
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:01,659
his heart would explode and they made a sequel.

709
00:50:02,739 --> 00:50:04,239
Yeah, insane.

710
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:08,599
Okay, where is it?

711
00:50:12,349 --> 00:50:13,050
Can I use it?

712
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:13,650
How do I use it?

713
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:24,710
No, it's not going to work.

714
00:50:25,989 --> 00:50:26,690
Does that not work?

715
00:50:28,039 --> 00:50:28,340
That's it.

716
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:29,440
I need to put it right here, right?

717
00:50:30,949 --> 00:50:31,849
Press the use button.

718
00:50:32,050 --> 00:50:33,050
Oh my god.

719
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:34,650
Okay, we're good main main canal.

720
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:35,349
All right, let's go.

721
00:50:42,269 --> 00:50:42,969
Something in my eye.

722
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,079
I'm loading my shotgun up just in case one of those bird

723
00:50:51,179 --> 00:50:52,280
things shows up.

724
00:50:55,070 --> 00:50:55,869
Main canal.

725
00:50:56,650 --> 00:50:57,349
Pump room.

726
00:51:06,699 --> 00:51:07,400
What the fuck?

727
00:51:20,929 --> 00:51:21,829
Oh god damn it.

728
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:39,809
No, just go back back back back.

729
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:49,500
I can do it.

730
00:52:12,659 --> 00:52:13,659
I don't know which side he's on.

731
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,460
I don't know which side he's on.

732
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:17,059
He's right in front of me.

733
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:18,460
I don't know which side he's on.

734
00:52:25,179 --> 00:52:25,679
Nobody here.

735
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:26,579
Which side is he?

736
00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:32,170
I got to keep my fucking heart rate up, mate.

737
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:34,469
I just keep punching people in the fucking face, man.

738
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:39,039
Are you fucking trying to tell me that fuck my heart rate

739
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:42,739
goes down under 14,000 fucking beats per minute, mate?

740
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:45,469
Oh god, I'm in trouble now.

741
00:52:46,369 --> 00:52:46,769
I have to run.

742
00:52:46,769 --> 00:52:47,369
How do I get out of here?

743
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,559
Idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot.

744
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:56,260
Joke was more important than playing the game.

745
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:58,559
Joke was up here playing game down here.

746
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:00,460
Way more important apparently.

747
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:09,050
I'm not afraid now.

748
00:53:12,099 --> 00:53:13,199
No, I'm not even afraid.

749
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:15,760
Let's go.

750
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:22,030
Now, now I'm annoyed.

751
00:53:22,030 --> 00:53:22,630
Let's go.

752
00:53:27,639 --> 00:53:28,340
I'm not afraid.

753
00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:40,429
Come on.

754
00:53:44,969 --> 00:53:45,769
Hey, stupid.

755
00:53:46,369 --> 00:53:47,170
Why don't you come up here?

756
00:53:47,969 --> 00:53:48,969
But only come one at a time though.

757
00:53:50,099 --> 00:53:50,400
What?

758
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:03,650
Where?

759
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:04,050
What?

760
00:54:08,159 --> 00:54:09,159
Oh my god, he's behind me.

761
00:54:18,489 --> 00:54:19,190
I have to sneak.

762
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:19,989
I can't attack him.

763
00:54:19,989 --> 00:54:21,090
I can't, I have to sneak around.

764
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:23,300
I just have to sneak around.

765
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:24,199
You can't attack them.

766
00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:25,599
Attacking is wrong.

767
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:26,300
It needs to go.

768
00:54:30,829 --> 00:54:31,730
It's a stealth game.

769
00:54:31,829 --> 00:54:34,929
I know, but I, I can't do stealth games.

770
00:54:38,849 --> 00:54:41,050
There are two things in this world that I cannot do.

771
00:54:41,989 --> 00:54:48,110
Stealth adventure and a Tetris.

772
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:54,599
Or most math problems.

773
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:01,619
Who even saw me?

774
00:55:08,949 --> 00:55:10,349
Thank god, there's no bullets in this gun.

775
00:55:10,349 --> 00:55:12,750
I would have shot it and I would have, I gave my position away.

776
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:19,969
Oh my god, what are they doing?

777
00:55:44,969 --> 00:55:46,570
They're sprinting around.

778
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:48,269
What am I supposed to do?

779
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:03,030
What?

780
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:03,429
Where?

781
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:04,230
Where are you?

782
00:56:06,159 --> 00:56:06,960
What the fuck?

783
00:56:38,179 --> 00:56:39,179
God damn it.

784
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,039
All right, turn it back down.

785
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:46,739
I got to get, I'm almost at the end of the demo.

786
00:56:46,739 --> 00:56:47,340
I imagine.

787
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:51,400
I'm going to turn it back down to where it was.

788
00:56:52,599 --> 00:56:53,000
Here.

789
00:56:54,190 --> 00:56:55,889
See, it's back down to where it was.

790
00:57:01,199 --> 00:57:01,599
That was fun.

791
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:02,599
Was that loud too?

792
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,099
Was that like crunchy and horrible?

793
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:10,880
Yes.

794
00:57:11,179 --> 00:57:19,800
God damn it.

795
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:20,800
This part's hard.

796
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,480
I'm just gonna kill them.

797
00:57:29,539 --> 00:57:30,039
Fuck it.

798
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:32,659
I'm doing it my way.

799
00:57:35,139 --> 00:57:37,239
And that's stand right here in the light.

800
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:38,840
It is this three.

801
00:57:39,869 --> 00:57:40,969
This guy's dead right now.

802
00:57:41,469 --> 00:57:41,969
There's one.

803
00:57:42,170 --> 00:57:42,670
There's one.

804
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:43,170
There's one.

805
00:57:43,170 --> 00:57:43,670
There's one.

806
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:44,269
Here comes two.

807
00:57:44,269 --> 00:57:44,869
Where's two?

808
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:45,869
Here it comes.

809
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:46,769
Right there.

810
00:57:47,570 --> 00:57:48,969
Why is there only one shot in this gun?

811
00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:51,969
There's your second.

812
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:53,269
Where's the third one?

813
00:58:07,869 --> 00:58:08,269
Let's go.

814
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:19,369
Let's do the piece.

815
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:45,280
Hey, hey boys and girls.

816
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:52,389
That would be a fucked up start to Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.

817
00:58:57,929 --> 00:59:00,230
What a weird intro.

818
00:59:06,050 --> 00:59:07,150
He's kind of like a monkey.

819
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:08,949
Or I have to get out of here.

820
00:59:11,489 --> 00:59:12,289
Where's the exit?

821
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:19,130
Okay, there's not gonna be another one spawning, right?

822
00:59:21,719 --> 00:59:22,519
Okay, I got bullets.

823
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:25,980
Get out of here.

824
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,300
Go, go, go, go, go, get out, out, out.

825
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:47,940
I'm feeling to full health.

826
00:59:48,239 --> 00:59:49,340
It's just a demo guys.

827
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:50,340
I'm gonna get to the end of the demo.

828
00:59:51,440 --> 01:00:01,039
Oh, okay.

829
01:00:01,039 --> 01:00:01,840
This is like a shortcut.

830
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:03,340
This looks wrong.

831
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,340
Oh, it's cuz I was cheating.

832
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:17,000
Okay.

833
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,300
Now that I was gonna go to that door.

834
01:00:20,289 --> 01:00:20,789
I did it.

835
01:00:20,889 --> 01:00:21,289
All right.

836
01:00:21,489 --> 01:00:22,190
That was fun.

837
01:00:22,690 --> 01:00:23,789
That's terrifying but fun.

838
01:00:28,289 --> 01:00:28,789
There we go.

839
01:00:29,090 --> 01:00:29,590
Hell, yeah.

840
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:35,280
Is there more?

841
01:00:41,989 --> 01:00:42,590
Stanley?

842
01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:44,989
Stanley walked into the church.

843
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:55,250
Very good.

844
01:00:56,789 --> 01:00:57,190
That was good.

845
01:00:57,190 --> 01:00:58,289
That was intense.

846
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:00,579
That was Gloomwood.

847
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:04,579
Uh, explore the early access August 16th.

848
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:08,880
I'd mark that one on your calendar seems like it's gonna be really good.

849
01:01:10,489 --> 01:01:11,489
Gonna give that one a rating.

850
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:15,239
No, that's higher than this 3.9.

851
01:01:19,190 --> 01:01:20,389
The demo for Gloomwood

852
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:23,599
was a four

853
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:25,840
point.

854
01:01:32,699 --> 01:01:33,099
Hold on.

855
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:34,099
Don't influence me.

856
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:36,099
Sound design.

857
01:01:36,199 --> 01:01:36,599
Five.

858
01:01:38,849 --> 01:01:39,750
Length of the demo.

859
01:01:40,449 --> 01:01:40,849
Five.

860
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:43,900
Getting right to the point.

861
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:44,699
Five.

862
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:47,039
Just right to the point.

863
01:01:47,039 --> 01:01:48,039
Hey, this is what you're doing.

864
01:01:48,039 --> 01:01:49,539
Here's a little tasks.

865
01:01:49,739 --> 01:01:50,840
Just go play the demo.

866
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:51,239
Five.

867
01:01:55,860 --> 01:01:56,559
Scare factor.

868
01:01:57,360 --> 01:01:57,760
Five.

869
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:59,260
Four point six.

870
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:01,929
Stealth game.

871
01:02:02,730 --> 01:02:03,130
Three.

872
01:02:16,099 --> 01:02:17,000
This is a 4.7.

873
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:19,699
This demo with not this demo was a 4.7.

874
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:24,280
No, I'm not.

875
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:24,679
Well, hold on.

876
01:02:24,679 --> 01:02:25,280
Whoa.

877
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:30,380
I'm not saying that like a this is me personally give this is me personally giving you a review.

878
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:33,500
Does that mean stealth games are bad?

879
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:36,800
No, that's just how I feel about stealth games.

880
01:02:37,199 --> 01:02:38,099
I'm not very good at them.

881
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:40,199
I'm very bad at them and I can't play them very well.

882
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:43,699
So for me a stealth game right off the bat is like a two.

883
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:44,300
Okay.

884
01:02:45,199 --> 01:02:47,300
A stealth game is a two right off right out of the box.

885
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:50,260
This one was really good.

886
01:02:53,670 --> 01:02:54,269
4.6.

887
01:02:54,269 --> 01:02:54,670
Let's go.

888
01:02:57,849 --> 01:02:58,650
That's a skill issue.

889
01:02:59,050 --> 01:03:00,050
I look okay.

890
01:03:02,050 --> 01:03:02,849
That was phenomenal.

891
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:05,900
Right out of the box.

892
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,900
All stealth games get like a 1.5 for me.

893
01:03:10,090 --> 01:03:12,789
There's no the game could be a 10 and 10 masterpiece.

894
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,239
That's a 4.6 out of five.

895
01:03:19,590 --> 01:03:20,989
Yeah, that was phenomenal.

896
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:23,480
Very very well done.

897
01:03:24,179 --> 01:03:29,860
I loved it, but I'm terrible at stealth games and I can never play this game the way it's intended for it to be played.

898
01:03:32,010 --> 01:03:33,409
But I can still enjoy it.

899
01:03:33,409 --> 01:03:36,039
I think what about Metal Gear?

900
01:03:36,739 --> 01:03:37,739
I feel the same way right?

901
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:42,460
You guys have any idea how many times when I was playing Metal Gear.

902
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:46,159
I heard there he is and I would just go.

903
01:03:50,289 --> 01:03:51,190
No, that was fantastic.

904
01:03:51,190 --> 01:03:53,590
4.6 gloom would look actually look forward.

905
01:03:53,590 --> 01:03:59,840
I'm looking forward to playing it because that I mean you got a Mickey Mouse scream out of me.

906
01:04:00,039 --> 01:04:01,539
It was like horror and stealth though.

907
01:04:01,639 --> 01:04:03,480
So that's that was awesome.

908
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:05,179
It wasn't just a stealth game.

909
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:07,599
Don't categorize it as that.

910
01:04:11,579 --> 01:04:16,820
Okay, so now I also because we queued up another one for today as well.

911
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:22,579
Trey Pang that I remember I got that one last night.

912
01:04:22,579 --> 01:04:23,280
I was going to try it.

913
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:23,980
Let's try that one.

914
01:04:32,239 --> 01:04:33,039
Trey Pang 2.

915
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:38,599
Okay.

916
01:04:38,599 --> 01:04:42,730
Let me get the game here difficulty normal video resolution.

917
01:04:42,730 --> 01:04:47,920
That's a weird resolution that I don't have 1440p.

918
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:52,969
Come on, bro 90 FOV.

919
01:04:53,469 --> 01:04:55,170
No motion blur, please.

920
01:04:55,469 --> 01:04:56,369
You can't see sorry.

921
01:05:06,199 --> 01:05:09,860
Okay, a field of view 90 gamma.

922
01:05:11,389 --> 01:05:12,190
I think that looks all right.

923
01:05:12,190 --> 01:05:14,889
Wait, is this a scary game to quality preset high audio?

924
01:05:14,889 --> 01:05:15,190
All right.

925
01:05:15,190 --> 01:05:15,789
This is important.

926
01:05:16,090 --> 01:05:16,789
How loud is it?

927
01:05:16,789 --> 01:05:17,389
I can't really tell.

928
01:05:17,929 --> 01:05:18,429
Is it good?

929
01:05:24,119 --> 01:05:25,519
Does it mean lower a little bit higher?

930
01:05:28,530 --> 01:05:29,429
I can't see over here.

931
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:32,380
Maybe like a little bit lower.

932
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:36,030
We'll take it down to like 70.

933
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:37,260
How's that?

934
01:05:40,230 --> 01:05:40,929
It's doing normal.

935
01:05:47,869 --> 01:05:53,059
Did that just what's going on?

936
01:06:07,860 --> 01:06:08,860
It's very far.

937
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:11,760
I was like, wait, when are we going to stop and it's going to be us standing there.

938
01:06:13,179 --> 01:06:16,079
Wait, trepang 2 was made by trepang.

939
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:18,780
There was a trepang one and it was made by trepang studios.

940
01:06:19,730 --> 01:06:20,130
Okay.

941
01:06:20,630 --> 01:06:21,030
All right.

942
01:06:21,530 --> 01:06:21,929
Let's go.

943
01:06:28,719 --> 01:06:29,420
So this is a sequel.

944
01:06:38,610 --> 01:06:39,010
Okay.

945
01:06:59,829 --> 01:07:01,230
That was that scream.

946
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:10,489
Just shoot me in the face.

947
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:15,500
Am I all right?

948
01:07:20,969 --> 01:07:21,369
What do you know?

949
01:07:21,369 --> 01:07:22,070
He missed.

950
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:23,210
He missed.

951
01:07:23,210 --> 01:07:25,309
I he point he missed.

952
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:27,250
I missed.

953
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:27,650
All right.

954
01:07:27,750 --> 01:07:32,940
I can't see fucking anything.

955
01:07:32,940 --> 01:07:33,440
Hold on.

956
01:07:41,489 --> 01:07:43,289
It's it's so dark.

957
01:07:45,719 --> 01:07:46,820
Can everybody see anything?

958
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:56,150
Little lower this DPI on this mouse is seriously.

959
01:07:56,349 --> 01:07:58,349
How would you ever have it this high?

960
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Somebody correct me.

961
01:08:03,820 --> 01:08:10,260
And is this weird to like I've never played a video game where this was ever higher than here.

962
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:18,979
Out of a hundred who how could you ever have a hundred is my mouse just fucked up?

963
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:20,619
Is it my mouse just weird?

964
01:08:23,159 --> 01:08:28,659
I'm gonna say for the feels better.

965
01:08:28,659 --> 01:08:28,960
All right.

966
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:32,020
So then now turn the gamma up a little is that cheating?

967
01:08:35,899 --> 01:08:37,000
What about just like 10%?

968
01:08:38,939 --> 01:08:41,159
I think that's okay, right?

969
01:08:43,909 --> 01:08:45,609
It has to be an even number of freak out.

970
01:08:45,710 --> 01:08:46,010
Okay.

971
01:08:47,489 --> 01:08:49,789
Like I security is not responding.

972
01:08:51,039 --> 01:08:51,739
That's the game.

973
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:10,770
What is going on?

974
01:09:14,210 --> 01:09:14,810
What was that?

975
01:09:15,899 --> 01:09:16,300
What happened?

976
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:18,600
Units were under attack by unknown elements.

977
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:21,000
Execute Operation Bright Star immediately.

978
01:09:37,649 --> 01:09:38,949
That's something was running down the hall.

979
01:09:40,119 --> 01:09:40,520
Okay.

980
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:41,920
There's something is running down the hall.

981
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:50,399
Is this stealth game?

982
01:09:56,479 --> 01:10:10,579
It is still too high.

983
01:10:14,869 --> 01:10:16,270
And I'm going 120.

984
01:10:16,270 --> 01:10:17,069
We're going 20%.

985
01:10:18,130 --> 01:10:20,930
And I need to turn this down to like two.

986
01:10:23,210 --> 01:10:27,909
You know, I've been concerned playing games before where I didn't think even down at one.

987
01:10:28,510 --> 01:10:30,210
It felt really bad.

988
01:10:31,050 --> 01:10:32,250
And I was like, what am I supposed to do about this?

989
01:10:32,250 --> 01:10:33,350
I have to like change the deep.

990
01:10:33,350 --> 01:10:34,649
I have to go into the DPI settings.

991
01:10:34,649 --> 01:10:34,949
All right.

992
01:10:36,229 --> 01:10:37,130
Three should be fine.

993
01:10:39,369 --> 01:10:40,170
Three's fine.

994
01:10:43,430 --> 01:10:43,930
Yeah, that's better.

995
01:10:43,930 --> 01:10:44,430
That feels good.

996
01:10:44,630 --> 01:10:45,229
It feels natural.

997
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:50,859
This game looks really nice hiding the dark.

998
01:10:52,859 --> 01:10:53,560
Is there a run?

999
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:57,199
I just pressed E.

1000
01:10:57,199 --> 01:10:57,600
What happened?

1001
01:10:58,600 --> 01:10:59,000
Oops.

1002
01:11:02,079 --> 01:11:02,680
Hey fellas.

1003
01:11:04,079 --> 01:11:05,279
Let me distract you for a second.

1004
01:11:05,579 --> 01:11:06,380
Would it work here?

1005
01:11:09,409 --> 01:11:13,010
You see I my car broke down on the road.

1006
01:11:14,409 --> 01:11:15,109
Can you believe it?

1007
01:11:15,109 --> 01:11:16,310
Right a mile down the road.

1008
01:11:16,310 --> 01:11:17,409
I had to walk a mile.

1009
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:20,600
It probably just killed me.

1010
01:11:23,210 --> 01:11:24,710
That would be like a target sighted.

1011
01:11:32,069 --> 01:11:33,470
It was some kind of currency thing.

1012
01:11:35,359 --> 01:11:36,159
Do I have a flashlight?

1013
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:41,640
What?

1014
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:45,050
Who?

1015
01:11:52,689 --> 01:11:56,390
Yo, yo, I think I see him.

1016
01:11:57,789 --> 01:11:58,689
What's on the dings?

1017
01:11:58,989 --> 01:11:59,789
What's going on?

1018
01:11:59,890 --> 01:12:00,289
What?

1019
01:12:00,789 --> 01:12:01,590
Clown mode?

1020
01:12:01,590 --> 01:12:02,489
What's clown mode?

1021
01:12:03,489 --> 01:12:04,289
Get out of here.

1022
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:07,920
What?

1023
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:08,920
How do I run?

1024
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:10,520
What is sprint?

1025
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:13,619
How do I run?

1026
01:12:14,119 --> 01:12:14,819
How do you run?

1027
01:12:14,819 --> 01:12:15,819
Somebody tell me how you run?

1028
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:16,619
How do I run?

1029
01:12:16,619 --> 01:12:17,119
How do I run?

1030
01:12:17,119 --> 01:12:17,720
How do I run?

1031
01:12:18,619 --> 01:12:19,220
How do I run?

1032
01:12:19,220 --> 01:12:19,819
How do I run?

1033
01:12:35,390 --> 01:12:36,989
There's nobody in the wall, man.

1034
01:12:39,079 --> 01:12:40,380
That guy's pretending to work.

1035
01:12:45,819 --> 01:12:46,720
What the fuck?

1036
01:12:50,039 --> 01:12:50,640
Clown mode.

1037
01:12:53,140 --> 01:12:54,140
I'm stuck in here.

1038
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:55,039
How do I get out of here?

1039
01:12:56,810 --> 01:13:07,380
Is there a jump throwing flares in here?

1040
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:08,279
How do I get out of here?

1041
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:09,479
Oh, wait, I see.

1042
01:13:17,399 --> 01:13:19,899
You can't get me up if I save area here.

1043
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:28,119
Who would win a hundred guys with machine guns or a walking

1044
01:13:28,119 --> 01:13:28,819
clown?

1045
01:13:40,149 --> 01:13:41,149
How do I run?

1046
01:13:43,510 --> 01:13:44,510
I like this game.

1047
01:13:44,810 --> 01:13:47,609
This I think this game's got serious potential.

1048
01:13:48,310 --> 01:13:50,909
And I mean it dead serious potential.

1049
01:14:06,689 --> 01:14:07,090
Oh my God.

1050
01:14:07,090 --> 01:14:07,590
There's a gun.

1051
01:14:19,270 --> 01:14:20,170
Is there aim down sights?

1052
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:21,500
Nope.

1053
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:22,300
It's okay.

1054
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:22,699
All right.

1055
01:14:22,699 --> 01:14:23,899
It's kind of like Counter-Strike mode.

1056
01:14:26,289 --> 01:14:26,989
Oh my God.

1057
01:14:27,090 --> 01:14:28,090
Oh, what the fuck?

1058
01:14:36,260 --> 01:14:37,960
Okay, let's go.

1059
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:41,359
Should I go across?

1060
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:42,159
Wait, what's in here?

1061
01:14:42,159 --> 01:14:42,760
Might be ammo.

1062
01:14:43,260 --> 01:14:44,060
Is there flashlight?

1063
01:14:47,489 --> 01:14:48,289
No, can't get in there.

1064
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:49,800
There we go.

1065
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:50,500
There's the sprint.

1066
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:58,239
Go to we lost contact 106 stay sharp jump and melee to do.

1067
01:14:58,239 --> 01:14:58,939
Oh my God.

1068
01:14:58,939 --> 01:14:59,439
There's a kick.

1069
01:14:59,439 --> 01:15:09,479
Okay potential left alt is slide.

1070
01:15:15,729 --> 01:15:16,430
Oh my God.

1071
01:15:16,430 --> 01:15:16,829
Okay.

1072
01:15:16,829 --> 01:15:17,829
That's gonna be hard to do though.

1073
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:23,060
Flashlight.

1074
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:23,760
Thank you.

1075
01:15:34,340 --> 01:15:35,140
I got full health.

1076
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:42,859
Would you I missed it.

1077
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:43,760
What'd I miss?

1078
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:52,140
What'd I miss?

1079
01:15:55,479 --> 01:15:56,079
Turn off the light.

1080
01:15:56,079 --> 01:15:56,680
What'd I miss?

1081
01:16:02,859 --> 01:16:03,560
You missed it.

1082
01:16:03,859 --> 01:16:04,560
I didn't miss anything.

1083
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:05,159
What'd I miss?

1084
01:16:11,399 --> 01:16:19,750
Go back up to the way the body is where I missed lore.

1085
01:16:20,050 --> 01:16:20,550
Whatever.

1086
01:16:21,239 --> 01:16:21,739
It's a demo.

1087
01:16:21,739 --> 01:16:22,140
It's fine.

1088
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:33,670
Running is clean by the way, if you're curious running is very

1089
01:16:33,670 --> 01:16:34,069
clean.

1090
01:16:56,329 --> 01:16:59,600
But what's a blue?

1091
01:17:13,909 --> 01:17:15,109
I tried to shoot two times.

1092
01:17:34,380 --> 01:17:34,680
What's that?

1093
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:34,979
What's that?

1094
01:17:34,979 --> 01:17:35,380
What is this?

1095
01:17:36,180 --> 01:17:36,579
What's this?

1096
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:37,380
What is that?

1097
01:17:57,640 --> 01:17:58,939
We can't even hit each other.

1098
01:17:59,739 --> 01:18:01,239
What a bunch of fucking idiots.

1099
01:18:07,130 --> 01:18:07,630
The gun.

1100
01:18:08,310 --> 01:18:09,310
This is great.

1101
01:18:09,409 --> 01:18:10,710
This plays really well.

1102
01:18:31,109 --> 01:18:32,310
Don't miss any lore, right?

1103
01:18:34,550 --> 01:18:35,050
What's the game name?

1104
01:18:35,050 --> 01:18:37,350
This is called trepang 2.

1105
01:18:42,130 --> 01:18:43,630
Is there is there actually a trepang 1?

1106
01:18:44,949 --> 01:18:46,550
This is actually really really good.

1107
01:19:23,020 --> 01:19:24,619
So he's playing angry foot.

1108
01:19:27,479 --> 01:19:28,079
How does this feel?

1109
01:19:28,079 --> 01:19:28,479
Is this like?

1110
01:19:31,340 --> 01:19:31,739
Yep.

1111
01:19:52,039 --> 01:19:53,539
This is like an ammo crate or something.

1112
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:54,239
No.

1113
01:19:57,220 --> 01:19:58,420
Oh, yeah, I'll take it.

1114
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:01,199
I love shotguns like my favorite in every game.

1115
01:20:06,149 --> 01:20:06,649
Armor.

1116
01:20:06,750 --> 01:20:07,149
Yep.

1117
01:20:13,739 --> 01:20:14,840
Slow down time.

1118
01:20:27,159 --> 01:20:27,760
Shit.

1119
01:20:30,649 --> 01:20:31,850
Oh my god.

1120
01:20:40,779 --> 01:20:41,680
Oh shit.

1121
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:42,880
Oh shit.

1122
01:20:44,279 --> 01:20:45,180
Oh shit.

1123
01:20:47,060 --> 01:20:49,060
That was so what an amazing game.

1124
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,100
That was fear, right?

1125
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:51,699
This.

1126
01:20:51,699 --> 01:20:51,899
Yeah.

1127
01:20:51,899 --> 01:20:52,699
This is fear.

1128
01:20:56,750 --> 01:20:57,350
Oh shit.

1129
01:20:59,090 --> 01:20:59,989
Do they do it still?

1130
01:21:04,430 --> 01:21:05,130
Oh shit.

1131
01:21:05,130 --> 01:21:05,729
Come on.

1132
01:21:21,670 --> 01:21:22,569
I can throw him.

1133
01:21:24,810 --> 01:21:25,810
What do you mean grenade?

1134
01:21:35,930 --> 01:21:38,430
Well, this is out fucking rages.

1135
01:21:38,529 --> 01:21:39,130
Okay.

1136
01:21:50,789 --> 01:21:51,489
Where should I go?

1137
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:06,760
Violent violence, Andy.

1138
01:22:18,260 --> 01:22:19,159
Jesus.

1139
01:22:20,279 --> 01:22:21,279
What the fuck happened here?

1140
01:22:27,899 --> 01:22:29,000
Oh my fucking God.

1141
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:29,899
Wait, I didn't.

1142
01:22:29,899 --> 01:22:30,600
Did I do this?

1143
01:22:31,539 --> 01:22:32,340
This is me.

1144
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:32,640
Wait.

1145
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:34,039
Oh, I'm progressing through.

1146
01:22:35,439 --> 01:22:36,340
Oh, no.

1147
01:22:37,039 --> 01:22:37,840
No, I didn't.

1148
01:22:38,039 --> 01:22:38,939
I didn't do this yet.

1149
01:22:40,010 --> 01:22:41,010
I haven't been here before.

1150
01:22:55,579 --> 01:22:57,079
He's in a time paradox.

1151
01:23:05,130 --> 01:23:09,319
Coin holding the coin like this get you killed.

1152
01:23:12,869 --> 01:23:13,569
Can I have a sword?

1153
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:18,359
Can I have the sword?

1154
01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:20,300
Sword looks pretty cool.

1155
01:23:21,930 --> 01:23:22,529
I don't think so.

1156
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:49,779
There's nobody here.

1157
01:23:50,079 --> 01:23:50,479
What?

1158
01:23:56,930 --> 01:23:57,529
Don't move.

1159
01:23:58,329 --> 01:23:59,229
Don't move.

1160
01:24:00,699 --> 01:24:02,000
Don't you dare move.

1161
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:08,000
Hey.

1162
01:24:08,699 --> 01:24:09,100
Don't.

1163
01:24:10,199 --> 01:24:12,300
I see what you're trying to do, but it's not going to work.

1164
01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:13,500
You're not going to get a good line on me.

1165
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:14,000
I tell you.

1166
01:24:16,170 --> 01:24:16,569
Hey.

1167
01:24:18,239 --> 01:24:18,739
Hey.

1168
01:24:19,739 --> 01:24:20,140
Hey.

1169
01:24:30,199 --> 01:24:31,800
I didn't want to kill that guy back there.

1170
01:24:49,439 --> 01:24:50,539
No, I wanted to grab him.

1171
01:24:55,619 --> 01:24:56,220
Stop.

1172
01:24:57,079 --> 01:24:59,350
Oh, I need more shotgun stuff.

1173
01:25:06,739 --> 01:25:07,140
Locked.

1174
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:07,439
Okay.

1175
01:25:11,789 --> 01:25:12,689
I love the flares.

1176
01:25:17,409 --> 01:25:17,710
I'm not.

1177
01:25:19,970 --> 01:25:20,869
Actually, this is probably better.

1178
01:25:21,470 --> 01:25:21,770
Yeah.

1179
01:25:29,149 --> 01:25:29,449
Okay.

1180
01:25:29,649 --> 01:25:30,449
Well, that's does that.

1181
01:25:31,250 --> 01:25:31,649
I'm all right.

1182
01:25:49,289 --> 01:25:49,689
Person.

1183
01:25:58,079 --> 01:26:00,899
The inside of my ear is itching.

1184
01:26:01,100 --> 01:26:02,899
Does that mean that somebody like sneezed?

1185
01:26:03,670 --> 01:26:04,170
What does that mean?

1186
01:26:04,170 --> 01:26:05,069
That means something right?

1187
01:26:12,899 --> 01:26:13,699
What the hell was that?

1188
01:26:13,699 --> 01:26:14,699
Was that little shimmy?

1189
01:26:23,819 --> 01:26:26,319
No, it's if somebody sneezes that means they're talking.

1190
01:26:26,420 --> 01:26:28,220
No, if you sneeze means somebody's talking about you.

1191
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:29,359
That's what it is.

1192
01:26:40,939 --> 01:26:42,140
Was that a huge kick?

1193
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:43,640
What the fuck was that?

1194
01:26:44,939 --> 01:26:46,340
What just happened to that guy?

1195
01:26:47,239 --> 01:26:48,140
Oh my God.

1196
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:58,220
I want this.

1197
01:27:11,189 --> 01:27:11,489
Okay.

1198
01:27:12,539 --> 01:27:15,090
Oh, ding dong.

1199
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:25,069
Oh, what?

1200
01:27:32,279 --> 01:27:33,279
Who's still alive?

1201
01:27:33,579 --> 01:27:34,380
Who's alive?

1202
01:27:36,439 --> 01:27:37,239
Is it what?

1203
01:27:47,239 --> 01:27:49,640
I put a grenade on him and threw him back in the elevator.

1204
01:27:50,579 --> 01:27:50,880
All right.

1205
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:51,180
We're good.

1206
01:27:51,180 --> 01:27:51,380
We're good.

1207
01:27:51,380 --> 01:27:51,680
We're good.

1208
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:51,979
I got it.

1209
01:27:51,979 --> 01:27:52,180
I got it.

1210
01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:52,479
I got it.

1211
01:28:09,890 --> 01:28:10,789
This gun sucks.

1212
01:28:24,060 --> 01:28:24,560
I love it.

1213
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:25,359
I love it.

1214
01:28:25,659 --> 01:28:27,659
I'm just having too much fun being like an idiot.

1215
01:28:42,460 --> 01:28:42,960
Open, open, open.

1216
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:44,359
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

1217
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:46,260
No.

1218
01:28:57,260 --> 01:28:57,359
All right.

1219
01:28:57,359 --> 01:28:57,859
Give me up.

1220
01:29:03,199 --> 01:29:03,600
We're good.

1221
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:09,399
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1222
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:12,220
Hey.

1223
01:29:15,850 --> 01:29:34,180
Oh, I can't leave the room.

1224
01:29:40,649 --> 01:29:41,149
Okay.

1225
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:41,850
I'm alive.

1226
01:29:42,250 --> 01:29:42,649
I'm alive.

1227
01:29:42,649 --> 01:29:43,149
We're good.

1228
01:29:51,750 --> 01:29:52,949
That was insane.

1229
01:29:54,350 --> 01:29:55,050
Oh, grenades.

1230
01:29:55,779 --> 01:29:56,180
Where are they?

1231
01:29:56,479 --> 01:29:56,779
In here?

1232
01:30:01,939 --> 01:30:02,840
All right, G is grenade.

1233
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:06,659
Health, got it.

1234
01:30:12,859 --> 01:30:13,760
Silencers.

1235
01:30:16,420 --> 01:30:18,680
Where is there a silencer?

1236
01:30:18,779 --> 01:30:19,380
Where's the silencer?

1237
01:30:19,380 --> 01:30:19,779
Where is it?

1238
01:30:19,779 --> 01:30:20,279
Where is it?

1239
01:30:20,779 --> 01:30:21,579
It just popped up on the screen.

1240
01:30:21,579 --> 01:30:22,279
Where's the silencer?

1241
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:54,520
Oh, fuck.

1242
01:30:55,710 --> 01:30:59,109
Well, the game's physics just make a shitload of noise.

1243
01:31:00,289 --> 01:31:01,689
The game's physics makes a ton of noise.

1244
01:31:01,689 --> 01:31:02,689
What am I supposed to do about that?

1245
01:31:24,670 --> 01:31:24,970
Okay.

1246
01:31:27,210 --> 01:31:27,609
What?

1247
01:31:27,609 --> 01:31:28,609
There's another person here.

1248
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:35,859
Get out, get out, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1249
01:31:35,859 --> 01:31:36,560
Don't come near me.

1250
01:31:48,890 --> 01:31:50,590
You gotta shoot me in the shoes, man.

1251
01:31:50,590 --> 01:31:52,489
Why are you shooting right into the shield?

1252
01:31:54,810 --> 01:31:55,510
No ammo.

1253
01:32:07,739 --> 01:32:08,340
Oh, come on.

1254
01:32:08,340 --> 01:32:08,739
I don't.

1255
01:32:13,130 --> 01:32:13,430
Shoot him.

1256
01:32:14,819 --> 01:32:15,220
Why can't I?

1257
01:32:15,420 --> 01:32:15,920
What's going on?

1258
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:16,920
That was weird.

1259
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:44,239
We're here?

1260
01:32:45,340 --> 01:32:45,939
No, it's locked.

1261
01:32:45,939 --> 01:32:46,140
Shit.

1262
01:32:46,140 --> 01:32:46,640
Where did I go?

1263
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:51,840
What the hell is that?

1264
01:32:54,399 --> 01:32:55,500
Do you remember you're killing them?

1265
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:58,100
Yeah.

1266
01:32:58,899 --> 01:33:02,460
I'm playing a game where I'm there.

1267
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:05,359
They're coming in with us with machine guns to try to get me.

1268
01:33:06,930 --> 01:33:07,430
I'm like it.

1269
01:33:07,829 --> 01:33:09,430
I'm this is I'm like an SCP.

1270
01:33:09,430 --> 01:33:10,329
I don't know what's going on.

1271
01:33:12,819 --> 01:33:13,720
Yeah, no shit.

1272
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:16,720
I'm yeah, I'm this is of course that's what's happening.

1273
01:33:17,119 --> 01:33:17,720
Oh, shotgun.

1274
01:33:21,510 --> 01:33:22,710
You're killing them.

1275
01:33:40,819 --> 01:33:41,220
What?

1276
01:33:54,220 --> 01:33:54,720
Did I get him?

1277
01:34:00,710 --> 01:34:01,710
Oh my goodness.

1278
01:34:01,710 --> 01:34:02,810
Customize weapon.

1279
01:34:07,079 --> 01:34:08,279
Laser and a suppressor.

1280
01:34:08,279 --> 01:34:08,779
Holy shit.

1281
01:34:08,779 --> 01:34:09,279
Yeah, cool.

1282
01:34:13,420 --> 01:34:14,619
Can I customize this laser?

1283
01:34:19,300 --> 01:34:19,600
Laser.

1284
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:25,560
Yeah, the game is so loud.

1285
01:34:26,229 --> 01:34:27,329
I thought you guys told me it was good.

1286
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:30,720
I thought you guys told me it was good.

1287
01:34:31,119 --> 01:34:32,520
It's been this loud the whole time.

1288
01:35:06,699 --> 01:35:07,199
Wow.

1289
01:35:18,100 --> 01:35:19,500
Whoa, what the hell was that?

1290
01:35:24,770 --> 01:35:26,270
Whoa, don't walk into that.

1291
01:35:30,630 --> 01:35:31,329
Oh my God.

1292
01:35:31,529 --> 01:35:32,630
Don't don't don't don't don't don't.

1293
01:35:32,630 --> 01:35:33,130
What are you doing?

1294
01:35:33,130 --> 01:35:33,630
Don't throw that.

1295
01:35:33,630 --> 01:35:34,529
It's gonna blow the whole thing up.

1296
01:35:35,229 --> 01:35:35,930
Thanks, actually.

1297
01:35:46,420 --> 01:35:47,420
Oh shit.

1298
01:36:01,729 --> 01:36:02,829
I have three bullets.

1299
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:08,260
This looks.

1300
01:36:17,890 --> 01:36:18,390
What do you know?

1301
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:28,050
See you later guys.

1302
01:36:35,100 --> 01:36:36,399
Zero one respond.

1303
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:38,800
Son of a bitch.

1304
01:36:40,699 --> 01:36:41,699
They're gonna come from this way.

1305
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:43,800
Don't don't say move in.

1306
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:45,199
I know they're gonna go on the elevator.

1307
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:46,500
You're making this wheel.

1308
01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:47,399
They're making this too easy.

1309
01:36:50,770 --> 01:36:53,369
Zero two move in from the second elevator.

1310
01:36:53,369 --> 01:36:55,869
Sierra three move in from the third elevator.

1311
01:37:24,909 --> 01:37:25,510
Oh my God.

1312
01:37:25,510 --> 01:37:26,210
That guy's probably.

1313
01:37:43,819 --> 01:37:44,720
He's trapped.

1314
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:52,779
I'm trying to get him out.

1315
01:37:54,489 --> 01:37:55,689
Holy shit.

1316
01:37:55,890 --> 01:37:57,189
Oh my God.

1317
01:37:57,189 --> 01:37:57,590
No.

1318
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:03,000
He's.

1319
01:38:04,199 --> 01:38:05,100
I don't think he's alive.

1320
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:06,699
I don't think he's alive anymore.

1321
01:38:08,819 --> 01:38:09,020
What?

1322
01:38:09,020 --> 01:38:10,520
Another Sierra team?

1323
01:38:12,130 --> 01:38:12,529
Where?

1324
01:38:12,829 --> 01:38:21,140
Oh, I'm invisible.

1325
01:38:21,140 --> 01:38:22,140
You can't see me stupid.

1326
01:38:39,850 --> 01:38:40,149
You.

1327
01:38:48,449 --> 01:38:48,850
What?

1328
01:38:53,590 --> 01:38:54,789
Oh my God.

1329
01:39:06,119 --> 01:39:06,520
Okay.

1330
01:39:32,250 --> 01:39:33,449
God, there's a lot of fire.

1331
01:39:52,689 --> 01:39:54,590
Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.

1332
01:39:54,590 --> 01:39:55,489
This is a gug of the game.

1333
01:40:08,699 --> 01:40:09,100
All right.

1334
01:40:09,699 --> 01:40:11,000
He's gonna come in on his own, right?

1335
01:40:21,340 --> 01:40:21,640
Yep.

1336
01:40:23,300 --> 01:40:23,600
Okay.

1337
01:40:31,289 --> 01:40:31,689
Is he?

1338
01:40:42,050 --> 01:40:43,050
Oh, the baby's close.

1339
01:40:51,989 --> 01:40:53,590
This guy looks like he got a bug on the character.

1340
01:40:55,079 --> 01:40:55,779
What was that?

1341
01:40:56,079 --> 01:40:56,680
What happened?

1342
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:11,760
Is he on me?

1343
01:41:13,180 --> 01:41:14,180
Why is he attached to me?

1344
01:41:14,180 --> 01:41:14,880
Get him off me.

1345
01:41:43,199 --> 01:41:44,699
What the fuck, dude?

1346
01:41:44,699 --> 01:41:45,600
What the hell?

1347
01:41:46,300 --> 01:41:47,899
No, I didn't like that.

1348
01:41:48,399 --> 01:41:49,399
I didn't like that.

1349
01:41:49,399 --> 01:41:50,300
It was horrible.

1350
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:52,000
That was fucked.

1351
01:41:54,670 --> 01:41:55,770
Are they stopping me?

1352
01:41:58,350 --> 01:41:59,449
Wait, these are bad guys?

1353
01:42:03,100 --> 01:42:03,500
What?

1354
01:42:05,529 --> 01:42:06,430
What happened?

1355
01:42:06,630 --> 01:42:07,430
What's going on?

1356
01:42:07,430 --> 01:42:08,430
What's going on?

1357
01:42:08,930 --> 01:42:10,630
Wait, these are, I thought these are the enemies.

1358
01:42:10,829 --> 01:42:11,930
These are friendlies?

1359
01:42:11,930 --> 01:42:12,329
How?

1360
01:42:13,130 --> 01:42:14,229
These guys are what?

1361
01:42:20,140 --> 01:42:22,739
We're gonna, we're gonna get you out of here, man.

1362
01:42:27,390 --> 01:42:29,289
I was like, why are they not shooting at me?

1363
01:42:29,289 --> 01:42:30,189
It was weird.

1364
01:42:34,270 --> 01:42:34,970
I need to know.

1365
01:42:35,270 --> 01:42:36,170
I need to know.

1366
01:42:36,869 --> 01:42:37,670
I need to know.

1367
01:42:41,569 --> 01:42:42,470
I have to know.

1368
01:42:42,569 --> 01:42:44,069
Okay, I'm not leaving you until I know.

1369
01:42:55,199 --> 01:42:56,600
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1370
01:42:56,600 --> 01:42:57,500
I didn't mean to do that.

1371
01:42:57,500 --> 01:42:58,399
I really didn't.

1372
01:43:02,479 --> 01:43:05,779
I've been shooting at these guys in this armor the whole time.

1373
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:10,020
I didn't know that I was being rescued.

1374
01:43:10,020 --> 01:43:12,619
I just see guys pointing guns at me and I was like, oh, there,

1375
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:13,420
there he is.

1376
01:43:19,189 --> 01:43:20,789
That was insane.

1377
01:43:20,789 --> 01:43:21,689
Holy shit.

1378
01:43:21,689 --> 01:43:22,289
That's a five.

1379
01:43:32,600 --> 01:43:34,000
That's absolutely a five.

1380
01:43:38,329 --> 01:43:38,930
Wow.

1381
01:43:44,079 --> 01:43:44,979
When does this come out?

1382
01:43:53,819 --> 01:43:54,619
There's more?

1383
01:43:57,069 --> 01:43:57,869
It's not over.

1384
01:43:58,069 --> 01:43:58,569
Really?

1385
01:43:58,569 --> 01:43:59,170
Are you serious?

1386
01:44:06,850 --> 01:44:07,750
It's coming out this year?

1387
01:44:07,750 --> 01:44:08,449
Oh, hell yeah.

1388
01:44:13,079 --> 01:44:13,779
Oh my God.

1389
01:44:13,979 --> 01:44:15,880
Pleasure to finally meet you 106.

1390
01:44:16,840 --> 01:44:20,140
The Horizon Corporation had you locked away for a very long time.

1391
01:44:21,460 --> 01:44:22,560
They must be frightened.

1392
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:23,560
Now that you're free.

1393
01:44:24,260 --> 01:44:25,560
Customized appearance.

1394
01:44:26,359 --> 01:44:27,060
So do we.

1395
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:29,060
Who's what's going on?

1396
01:44:29,359 --> 01:44:31,060
Welcome to Task Force 27.

1397
01:44:31,260 --> 01:44:32,060
Oh, it's me shooting.

1398
01:44:47,689 --> 01:44:48,489
So what I do here.

1399
01:45:03,699 --> 01:45:04,899
Oh, we select missions.

1400
01:45:05,199 --> 01:45:05,899
It's kind of like a hub.

1401
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:13,359
That was just pure.

1402
01:45:14,100 --> 01:45:15,199
That was just adrenaline.

1403
01:45:17,510 --> 01:45:19,909
I'm starting to understand the kinds of games that I really like.

1404
01:45:20,409 --> 01:45:29,960
It's just like the go go go go go go go go go go do not kill.

1405
01:45:29,960 --> 01:45:32,359
I'm not going to I know now that I'm not I'm not going to shoot anybody.

1406
01:45:32,359 --> 01:45:32,760
Don't worry.

1407
01:45:34,069 --> 01:45:35,470
We have a mission ready for you.

1408
01:45:35,869 --> 01:45:39,270
A raid on a Horizon facility similar to the one you escaped from.

1409
01:45:40,279 --> 01:45:43,479
When you're ready head to the briefing room and we can get started.

1410
01:45:46,649 --> 01:45:47,149
Intel.

1411
01:45:47,850 --> 01:45:48,350
Okay.

1412
01:45:49,710 --> 01:45:52,210
Well, they better be Intel in that computer.

1413
01:45:56,329 --> 01:46:06,189
You know I'm saying prologue and okay complex.

1414
01:46:11,869 --> 01:46:13,770
Pack in and download the encrypted data.

1415
01:46:17,039 --> 01:46:17,439
It's normal.

1416
01:46:17,439 --> 01:46:18,039
Normal is fun.

1417
01:46:23,319 --> 01:46:24,119
Did I do it?

1418
01:46:24,220 --> 01:46:24,819
Do I have to leave?

1419
01:46:26,979 --> 01:46:27,779
Launch mission.

1420
01:46:31,020 --> 01:46:32,119
Oh, I have to get on the helicopter.

1421
01:46:32,119 --> 01:46:32,319
Okay.

1422
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:36,119
What is this?

1423
01:46:40,680 --> 01:46:42,510
No, no, no.

1424
01:46:42,710 --> 01:46:43,909
Oh, serum.

1425
01:46:44,109 --> 01:46:44,510
Of course.

1426
01:46:53,029 --> 01:46:54,729
That was a dual welding serum.

1427
01:46:55,729 --> 01:46:56,329
It's kind of weird.

1428
01:47:00,920 --> 01:47:23,010
Oh, oh, can you open the door for me?

1429
01:47:25,039 --> 01:47:25,539
I'll get it.

1430
01:47:34,500 --> 01:47:36,399
Customize change your clothes.

1431
01:47:36,699 --> 01:47:37,600
I don't care.

1432
01:47:38,300 --> 01:47:39,199
I don't need to change clothes.

1433
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:40,100
I think I'm good.

1434
01:47:44,720 --> 01:47:46,319
BF bugleberry serum.

1435
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:52,699
I didn't do that.

1436
01:47:52,699 --> 01:47:53,699
Don't blame that on me.

1437
01:47:54,609 --> 01:47:55,810
That was poor placement.

1438
01:47:57,029 --> 01:48:00,130
Okay, so I have to sneak in here and hack the mainframe.

1439
01:48:03,250 --> 01:48:04,449
Clean up how much?

1440
01:48:04,649 --> 01:48:05,449
Okay, clean up.

1441
01:48:05,949 --> 01:48:06,449
Armor.

1442
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:12,020
Oops.

1443
01:48:12,619 --> 01:48:13,619
What is clean up?

1444
01:48:18,810 --> 01:48:20,109
Access denied.

1445
01:48:22,260 --> 01:48:23,260
Do I need to keep doing that?

1446
01:48:24,170 --> 01:48:25,569
All right proximity hack.

1447
01:48:29,529 --> 01:48:31,529
I'm hacking a coke machine.

1448
01:48:31,630 --> 01:48:31,930
Oh.

1449
01:48:37,630 --> 01:48:38,130
What?

1450
01:48:38,529 --> 01:48:42,029
What's going on?

1451
01:48:42,130 --> 01:48:43,130
Wait, this is a setup.

1452
01:48:43,130 --> 01:48:43,829
They were waiting for me.

1453
01:48:45,270 --> 01:48:45,970
They were waiting for me.

1454
01:48:45,970 --> 01:48:47,069
This is a setup.

1455
01:48:54,260 --> 01:48:54,960
I couldn't find the gun.

1456
01:48:57,680 --> 01:48:58,279
Dual welding.

1457
01:48:58,579 --> 01:49:30,520
Dual welding.

1458
01:49:33,079 --> 01:49:33,880
So it's just okay.

1459
01:49:33,880 --> 01:49:34,680
It's like a wave.

1460
01:49:35,380 --> 01:49:53,340
Can I do it?

1461
01:50:06,420 --> 01:50:06,819
Hey, stop.

1462
01:50:06,920 --> 01:50:07,920
Stop anti hacking me.

1463
01:50:12,100 --> 01:50:12,699
Get out of here.

1464
01:50:20,939 --> 01:50:22,039
Get out of here with that Norton.

1465
01:50:53,430 --> 01:50:54,430
I was shooting at this friend.

1466
01:51:00,829 --> 01:51:01,229
What?

1467
01:51:01,229 --> 01:51:01,630
Oh my God.

1468
01:51:01,630 --> 01:51:02,229
He's alive.

1469
01:51:02,829 --> 01:51:03,430
He's alive.

1470
01:51:04,229 --> 01:51:04,630
No, he's not.

1471
01:51:04,729 --> 01:51:05,329
Never mind.

1472
01:51:06,529 --> 01:51:07,029
No, he's not.

1473
01:51:07,529 --> 01:51:08,029
Never mind.

1474
01:51:24,899 --> 01:51:25,500
Oh, it's done.

1475
01:51:25,500 --> 01:51:25,699
All right.

1476
01:51:25,699 --> 01:51:26,199
Now what?

1477
01:51:26,939 --> 01:51:27,840
Wave two.

1478
01:51:29,390 --> 01:51:30,289
Oh my God.

1479
01:51:31,090 --> 01:51:31,890
How long does this last?

1480
01:51:31,890 --> 01:51:32,189
I don't...

1481
01:51:37,039 --> 01:51:37,439
I want the...

1482
01:51:37,939 --> 01:51:38,439
Okay, over here.

1483
01:52:02,260 --> 01:52:05,060
Where'd he get this fucking Ghostbusters proton pack out of here?

1484
01:52:14,500 --> 01:52:14,899
What?

1485
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:15,800
Where was that guy?

1486
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:17,399
Where'd he go?

1487
01:52:20,579 --> 01:52:21,579
Where did that guy go?

1488
01:52:22,279 --> 01:52:35,510
He jumped over me.

1489
01:52:35,510 --> 01:52:36,010
Oh shit.

1490
01:53:06,680 --> 01:53:22,140
My God.

1491
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:28,800
The hell is that?

1492
01:53:28,899 --> 01:53:29,500
Oh my God.

1493
01:53:29,500 --> 01:53:30,000
What is he doing?

1494
01:53:30,399 --> 01:53:30,899
Stop.

1495
01:53:36,329 --> 01:53:36,729
Stop.

1496
01:53:36,930 --> 01:53:37,430
Stop.

1497
01:53:38,130 --> 01:53:39,630
There's literally no need for any of this.

1498
01:53:39,630 --> 01:53:40,029
Stop.

1499
01:53:43,380 --> 01:53:43,880
Stop.

1500
01:53:44,579 --> 01:53:45,380
Just stop.

1501
01:53:45,380 --> 01:53:45,979
Stop.

1502
01:53:46,079 --> 01:53:46,479
Enough.

1503
01:53:47,180 --> 01:53:47,680
Enough.

1504
01:53:57,960 --> 01:53:59,060
Okay, you still want...

1505
01:54:03,550 --> 01:54:04,250
I gotta clean up.

1506
01:54:07,869 --> 01:54:09,170
Wait, I can get in my own squad?

1507
01:54:29,569 --> 01:54:29,970
Oh my God.

1508
01:54:29,970 --> 01:54:30,970
They were just guarding it.

1509
01:54:34,239 --> 01:54:35,140
Oh shit.

1510
01:54:35,539 --> 01:54:36,439
I think I'm done here.

1511
01:54:41,500 --> 01:54:42,000
What is it?

1512
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:42,600
2500?

1513
01:54:52,500 --> 01:54:53,500
Oh my God.

1514
01:54:53,500 --> 01:54:54,600
They're just collapsing here.

1515
01:54:54,899 --> 01:55:05,149
All right, that one's done.

1516
01:55:13,390 --> 01:55:14,390
Where's the last one?

1517
01:55:18,140 --> 01:55:19,340
Ow, my ears.

1518
01:55:28,750 --> 01:55:29,550
Can I pick that up?

1519
01:55:33,460 --> 01:55:34,560
I just want to see what the squad looks like.

1520
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:35,159
And then I'm out of here.

1521
01:55:55,680 --> 01:55:56,380
Okay, 25 right now.

1522
01:55:56,380 --> 01:55:56,979
Let's get the squad.

1523
01:55:58,970 --> 01:55:59,869
All right, squad time.

1524
01:56:08,449 --> 01:56:09,949
Where's the supply thing?

1525
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:11,680
Where's the supply thing?

1526
01:56:18,119 --> 01:56:19,119
Where's the supply thing?

1527
01:56:19,119 --> 01:56:23,539
They're just throwing grenades.

1528
01:56:26,020 --> 01:56:27,119
All right, squad incoming.

1529
01:56:28,220 --> 01:56:28,720
Where are they?

1530
01:56:29,819 --> 01:56:30,319
Oh my God.

1531
01:56:30,319 --> 01:56:31,420
That's a lot of people.

1532
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:33,420
That's a huge amount of people.

1533
01:56:34,720 --> 01:56:36,119
Oh my God.

1534
01:56:41,149 --> 01:56:41,850
Be careful.

1535
01:56:42,250 --> 01:56:43,050
Be careful.

1536
01:56:43,649 --> 01:56:58,210
All right, move in, move in, move in.

1537
01:57:09,840 --> 01:57:10,340
What?

1538
01:57:11,859 --> 01:57:12,859
Grenade!

1539
01:57:13,460 --> 01:57:15,869
What?

1540
01:57:17,729 --> 01:57:19,029
I'm so confused.

1541
01:57:22,600 --> 01:57:23,500
Get in there, get in there, get in there.

1542
01:57:23,500 --> 01:57:24,500
There's somebody shooting me over here.

1543
01:57:33,439 --> 01:57:35,039
Okay, I think they were, I think they moved in this way.

1544
01:57:38,789 --> 01:57:40,789
The source of the interference is right here.

1545
01:57:41,960 --> 01:57:43,960
It's you, you motherfucker.

1546
01:57:46,020 --> 01:57:48,210
All right, move in.

1547
01:57:51,199 --> 01:57:51,699
Are you up?

1548
01:57:52,199 --> 01:57:53,100
I didn't know if you were on my team.

1549
01:58:00,090 --> 01:58:00,890
All right, let's move in.

1550
01:58:06,600 --> 01:58:07,800
Wave five incoming.

1551
01:58:08,909 --> 01:58:10,909
All right, I'm too stimulated.

1552
01:58:10,909 --> 01:58:11,710
I can't do it anymore.

1553
01:58:15,899 --> 01:58:17,300
All right, I'm too, I'm overstimulated.

1554
01:58:17,300 --> 01:58:17,899
I gotta get out of here.

1555
01:58:19,470 --> 01:58:20,569
I'm over, I'm way too stimulated.

1556
01:58:20,569 --> 01:58:21,069
I gotta go.

1557
01:58:28,470 --> 01:58:29,369
Did I get on my team?

1558
01:58:29,369 --> 01:58:30,569
Oh shit, I'm sorry.

1559
01:58:31,069 --> 01:58:31,970
I didn't mean to.

1560
01:58:37,729 --> 01:58:38,930
Who are you shooting at?

1561
01:58:39,329 --> 01:58:40,529
There's no one even here.

1562
01:58:41,569 --> 01:58:42,170
Who are you?

1563
01:58:45,159 --> 01:58:47,060
If this is just chaos, I don't even know who's who.

1564
01:58:55,390 --> 01:58:56,590
All right, just kill me, just kill me.

1565
01:58:56,590 --> 01:58:57,789
I want to get out of this.

1566
01:59:05,699 --> 01:59:07,300
No, I don't want to resume the cycle.

1567
01:59:07,300 --> 01:59:09,000
I want to, don't want to get out of here.

1568
01:59:15,079 --> 01:59:15,880
That was insane.

1569
01:59:15,880 --> 01:59:16,680
This game is crazy.

1570
01:59:18,159 --> 01:59:19,359
Oh, are you playing Call of Duty?

1571
01:59:19,359 --> 01:59:20,659
It's not, I mean that, not Call of Duty.

1572
01:59:22,390 --> 01:59:23,289
Okay, let's keep going.

1573
01:59:25,829 --> 01:59:27,329
That was Trey Pang 2.

1574
01:59:29,460 --> 01:59:31,659
Were there any more that I downloaded that last night?

1575
01:59:31,659 --> 01:59:32,359
I'm trying to remember.

1576
01:59:33,640 --> 01:59:35,340
Did I, do I have any more of that from yesterday?

1577
01:59:36,380 --> 01:59:37,180
I think there was one.

1578
01:59:41,340 --> 01:59:42,340
There was one that we were looking at.

1579
01:59:45,720 --> 01:59:47,020
Which one was it though?

1580
01:59:51,220 --> 01:59:52,920
Because I'm up in the top here.

1581
01:59:54,539 --> 01:59:58,840
If you take a look, this is the, so I'm on the action tab right now.

1582
02:00:01,180 --> 02:00:02,380
This is action adventure.

1583
02:00:04,979 --> 02:00:05,880
Some of these look kind of cool.

1584
02:00:07,199 --> 02:00:07,800
Turtles.

1585
02:00:08,640 --> 02:00:09,340
What's turtles?

1586
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:12,420
Casual, cute.

1587
02:00:13,199 --> 02:00:13,800
Should I do it?

1588
02:00:15,819 --> 02:00:16,920
Turtles looks pretty fun.

1589
02:00:18,970 --> 02:00:19,869
Action shooter.

1590
02:00:21,199 --> 02:00:22,100
Beat him up in D.

1591
02:00:24,119 --> 02:00:25,020
This one looks good too.

1592
02:00:27,210 --> 02:00:28,609
Gnome online.

1593
02:00:30,340 --> 02:00:31,939
Play turtles over going to leave.

1594
02:00:32,779 --> 02:00:33,579
I'll play turtles.

1595
02:00:33,579 --> 02:00:33,979
Let's do it.

1596
02:00:33,979 --> 02:00:34,279
All right.

1597
02:00:34,279 --> 02:00:34,779
I'll get turtles.

1598
02:00:34,779 --> 02:00:35,180
Let's do it.

1599
02:00:36,810 --> 02:00:39,310
The stream is going to F for five seconds while I do this.

1600
02:00:39,710 --> 02:00:41,859
Just to let you know.

1601
02:00:51,140 --> 02:00:51,739
Okay.

1602
02:00:52,739 --> 02:00:54,140
And let's open it.

1603
02:00:59,960 --> 02:01:00,960
Turtles demo.

1604
02:01:05,989 --> 02:01:06,689
Let's check this one.

1605
02:01:10,090 --> 02:01:12,689
So this is a prototype temporary assets.

1606
02:01:13,090 --> 02:01:26,020
Okay.

1607
02:01:26,319 --> 02:01:30,720
Turtles.

1608
02:01:33,460 --> 02:01:34,159
Let's just do it.

1609
02:01:35,489 --> 02:01:36,390
World one.

1610
02:01:42,380 --> 02:01:45,079
So these globes need to turn into turtles.

1611
02:01:50,279 --> 02:01:51,279
What is this?

1612
02:02:08,140 --> 02:02:08,539
Okay.

1613
02:02:10,619 --> 02:02:11,520
That was really loud.

1614
02:02:13,439 --> 02:02:14,539
Did I just pick these up?

1615
02:02:15,140 --> 02:02:15,739
Oh shit.

1616
02:02:15,739 --> 02:02:16,439
I'm messing this up.

1617
02:02:22,020 --> 02:02:36,899
Oh, I don't get stuck.

1618
02:02:47,359 --> 02:02:49,460
I like this is I didn't lose to a kid's game.

1619
02:02:49,460 --> 02:02:50,960
I'm still in literally first place.

1620
02:02:58,350 --> 02:03:00,050
Oh lost to a kid's game literally in first place.

1621
02:03:08,880 --> 02:03:09,380
Shit.

1622
02:03:13,409 --> 02:03:14,909
It's kind of like snake in a way.

1623
02:03:24,609 --> 02:03:25,310
I got everybody.

1624
02:03:29,550 --> 02:03:30,250
That's it, right?

1625
02:03:32,750 --> 02:03:34,350
I got literally every single person.

1626
02:03:35,380 --> 02:03:36,079
That was cute.

1627
02:03:38,949 --> 02:03:40,750
That was that I was really cute.

1628
02:03:40,750 --> 02:03:41,550
What was wrong with this?

1629
02:03:45,050 --> 02:03:45,449
That was it.

1630
02:03:45,449 --> 02:03:46,050
I like that.

1631
02:03:46,050 --> 02:03:46,850
That was really cute.

1632
02:03:51,920 --> 02:03:52,319
Okay.

1633
02:03:55,819 --> 02:03:56,619
Three stars, right?

1634
02:03:56,720 --> 02:03:57,119
Yep.

1635
02:04:02,560 --> 02:04:05,260
Okay, don't go in don't go down the hole because you'll lose

1636
02:04:05,260 --> 02:04:06,159
him if you go in the hole.

1637
02:04:06,260 --> 02:04:06,560
All right.

1638
02:04:06,560 --> 02:04:07,060
I get it.

1639
02:04:08,619 --> 02:04:09,520
There's a lot of holes.

1640
02:04:18,279 --> 02:04:18,979
New meta.

1641
02:04:25,739 --> 02:04:25,939
All right.

1642
02:04:25,939 --> 02:04:29,039
So I got to go up grab this one over here.

1643
02:04:29,539 --> 02:04:30,039
What just happened?

1644
02:04:30,039 --> 02:04:30,340
What?

1645
02:04:31,840 --> 02:04:33,739
Oh, I held it down too long.

1646
02:04:35,239 --> 02:04:41,640
Okay, be careful.

1647
02:04:42,239 --> 02:04:44,800
Let's go.

1648
02:04:50,659 --> 02:05:03,100
Okay, I gotta get them all down.

1649
02:05:03,800 --> 02:05:06,079
Pretty good, right?

1650
02:05:06,680 --> 02:05:13,979
Okay.

1651
02:05:13,979 --> 02:05:15,880
Now I'm going to have to spread them out a little.

1652
02:05:16,479 --> 02:05:19,039
Oops.

1653
02:05:29,399 --> 02:05:29,600
All right.

1654
02:05:29,600 --> 02:05:30,500
Get everybody into the wall.

1655
02:05:37,939 --> 02:05:38,739
Is that blocked?

1656
02:05:38,739 --> 02:05:39,739
Does the seashell block?

1657
02:05:39,739 --> 02:05:40,140
Nope.

1658
02:05:50,060 --> 02:05:56,399
Oh shit.

1659
02:05:56,399 --> 02:05:56,899
Hold on.

1660
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:00,100
Oh fuck.

1661
02:06:00,100 --> 02:06:00,699
Oh my God.

1662
02:06:00,699 --> 02:06:01,399
I didn't mean to do that.

1663
02:06:01,399 --> 02:06:01,800
Whatever.

1664
02:06:10,590 --> 02:06:10,989
Just again.

1665
02:06:10,989 --> 02:06:11,489
I'm done.

1666
02:06:11,590 --> 02:06:11,989
I'm done.

1667
02:06:11,989 --> 02:06:12,390
I'm done.

1668
02:06:13,390 --> 02:06:14,289
I blew it so bad.

1669
02:06:15,090 --> 02:06:16,090
I blew it really bad.

1670
02:06:17,609 --> 02:06:18,810
I just like kind of went too.

1671
02:06:18,909 --> 02:06:19,310
All right.

1672
02:06:20,979 --> 02:06:21,680
Maybe one star.

1673
02:06:26,920 --> 02:06:27,319
Two stars.

1674
02:06:27,319 --> 02:06:27,720
All right.

1675
02:06:32,140 --> 02:06:32,439
Next.

1676
02:06:32,439 --> 02:06:33,140
No, not yet.

1677
02:06:34,039 --> 02:06:35,539
So be careful of the birds.

1678
02:06:36,680 --> 02:06:37,479
The birds will eat me.

1679
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:55,800
Oh, I get it.

1680
02:06:55,800 --> 02:07:00,100
Okay, so you just can't be in that spot when the seagull comes.

1681
02:07:01,399 --> 02:07:02,100
Sounds easy enough.

1682
02:07:06,220 --> 02:07:07,420
I hope it's just that one spot.

1683
02:07:24,670 --> 02:07:25,670
How do I get away from it?

1684
02:07:25,670 --> 02:07:26,170
How do I do this?

1685
02:07:31,899 --> 02:07:32,500
I can't do it.

1686
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:57,500
No.

1687
02:07:58,600 --> 02:07:59,000
I'm good.

1688
02:08:12,920 --> 02:08:13,619
Did I miss an egg?

1689
02:08:15,920 --> 02:08:16,119
Nope.

1690
02:08:16,119 --> 02:08:16,520
We're good.

1691
02:08:24,850 --> 02:08:25,649
Go back down this way.

1692
02:08:28,810 --> 02:08:29,710
Is there a time limit?

1693
02:08:30,109 --> 02:08:31,109
Why is the music getting faster?

1694
02:08:31,710 --> 02:08:32,510
Sounds like a time limit.

1695
02:08:47,239 --> 02:08:48,239
How am I going to get them up there?

1696
02:08:48,239 --> 02:08:48,640
What?

1697
02:08:50,500 --> 02:08:52,000
I have to do it like one by one.

1698
02:08:53,890 --> 02:08:54,390
Wait, I got it.

1699
02:08:54,390 --> 02:08:54,890
I got an idea.

1700
02:08:59,710 --> 02:09:01,810
Oh, no.

1701
02:09:02,609 --> 02:09:03,310
Oh my God.

1702
02:09:03,310 --> 02:09:03,710
Forget it.

1703
02:09:03,710 --> 02:09:04,109
Whatever.

1704
02:09:36,319 --> 02:09:37,319
This game is fun, actually.

1705
02:09:37,319 --> 02:09:37,619
I like it.

1706
02:09:41,819 --> 02:09:42,720
I don't have very many complaints.

1707
02:09:43,729 --> 02:09:44,029
What?

1708
02:09:45,600 --> 02:09:46,699
I don't have very many complaints.

1709
02:09:50,489 --> 02:09:51,189
I really don't.

1710
02:10:02,489 --> 02:10:04,890
I mean, is it a kind of a simple little puzzle game?

1711
02:10:04,890 --> 02:10:05,289
Sure.

1712
02:10:05,289 --> 02:10:10,050
But can you find something to complain about?

1713
02:10:11,880 --> 02:10:13,479
No, fuck this game, man.

1714
02:10:13,479 --> 02:10:18,979
It's super cute and really easy to understand and challenging

1715
02:10:18,979 --> 02:10:20,880
and really just kind of fun.

1716
02:10:20,880 --> 02:10:25,130
And where's the blood, man?

1717
02:10:25,329 --> 02:10:25,829
Where's the blood?

1718
02:10:25,829 --> 02:10:26,930
How come you're not shooting anyone?

1719
02:10:29,770 --> 02:10:30,869
What's there something to complain about?

1720
02:10:30,869 --> 02:10:31,470
I want to hear it.

1721
02:10:33,470 --> 02:10:33,770
No, man.

1722
02:10:33,770 --> 02:10:35,470
The games are cute and like fun.

1723
02:10:35,470 --> 02:10:39,170
And it's like really looks like really anybody can enjoy it.

1724
02:10:39,770 --> 02:10:41,270
Dude, anybody can enjoy this.

1725
02:10:42,270 --> 02:10:49,300
Dad, tell that to the potion game.

1726
02:10:51,449 --> 02:10:53,949
That's unfair because the potion get this game is pick up

1727
02:10:53,949 --> 02:10:54,750
and play the potion.

1728
02:10:54,750 --> 02:10:55,750
It was a big story.

1729
02:11:01,659 --> 02:11:13,399
Oops, and the potion game was really cute.

1730
02:11:13,399 --> 02:11:15,699
What would you what would you complain about the potion game?

1731
02:11:15,699 --> 02:11:16,600
Pushing it was fine, too.

1732
02:11:17,100 --> 02:11:19,000
I give that like a I get that like a three eight.

1733
02:11:26,920 --> 02:11:27,220
What?

1734
02:11:27,220 --> 02:11:28,119
Oh, come on.

1735
02:11:28,319 --> 02:11:44,279
I mean for the fact that a lot of people say and I'll move on

1736
02:11:44,279 --> 02:11:48,680
a lot of you seem to be really, really connecting and really upset

1737
02:11:48,680 --> 02:11:50,180
when one of the turtles gets grabbed.

1738
02:11:51,680 --> 02:11:53,479
But you didn't care about this game.

1739
02:11:53,479 --> 02:11:54,979
I thought this was like a kid's game.

1740
02:11:54,979 --> 02:11:55,680
I don't care.

1741
02:11:57,279 --> 02:11:57,779
You do though.

1742
02:12:00,210 --> 02:12:01,710
You're rooting for these turtles.

1743
02:12:01,710 --> 02:12:03,710
You want them to succeed just like we all do.

1744
02:12:06,619 --> 02:12:07,720
See that move right there.

1745
02:12:22,199 --> 02:12:24,199
Guys, not every game has to have swears in it.

1746
02:12:25,699 --> 02:12:27,300
Not every game has to have swear words.

1747
02:12:39,569 --> 02:12:43,369
Oops, right when you hatched right when you hatched.

1748
02:12:48,159 --> 02:12:56,960
What I think I need to thin them out.

1749
02:12:57,260 --> 02:12:58,460
I don't think I can get up there all the way.

1750
02:13:01,140 --> 02:13:02,539
The seagull mechanic is really cool.

1751
02:13:02,539 --> 02:13:05,340
You know why because you can't just sit here and think it

1752
02:13:05,340 --> 02:13:06,340
makes you have to move.

1753
02:13:07,380 --> 02:13:09,979
I would call that that's a that's a brilliant game design

1754
02:13:09,979 --> 02:13:10,380
choice.

1755
02:13:11,079 --> 02:13:12,479
This game is moving into the force.

1756
02:13:12,880 --> 02:13:34,069
I just want you to know that 3.4.

1757
02:13:34,569 --> 02:13:39,039
Oh, I like it.

1758
02:13:39,539 --> 02:13:40,739
This is really cute and fun.

1759
02:13:40,739 --> 02:13:41,840
I don't have anything to complain about.

1760
02:13:41,840 --> 02:13:44,039
I wish I could I wish I could sit here and be like, well,

1761
02:13:44,039 --> 02:13:49,300
you know, I don't like animals.

1762
02:13:49,300 --> 02:13:50,899
Like, what do you want me to say?

1763
02:13:52,369 --> 02:13:54,170
I don't like this game because I don't like turtles.

1764
02:13:54,170 --> 02:13:55,569
I don't like reptiles.

1765
02:13:55,569 --> 02:13:59,670
It pisses me off reptiles piss me off.

1766
02:14:01,859 --> 02:14:06,300
I can't think of a reason why you would not like it and

1767
02:14:06,300 --> 02:14:08,300
excuse me community.

1768
02:14:09,760 --> 02:14:13,399
One of our favorite things of all time is a game called

1769
02:14:13,399 --> 02:14:18,369
Super Frog, which is far less complex than this game.

1770
02:14:22,270 --> 02:14:23,069
Oh, I got a big one.

1771
02:14:29,819 --> 02:14:32,819
So you can merge three or is that only specifically and

1772
02:14:36,710 --> 02:14:37,310
let's find out.

1773
02:14:39,010 --> 02:14:39,609
All right.

1774
02:14:39,609 --> 02:14:40,909
You got a new mechanic here now.

1775
02:14:46,949 --> 02:14:47,449
That's three.

1776
02:14:47,449 --> 02:14:47,949
Oh, no.

1777
02:14:47,949 --> 02:14:48,350
Okay.

1778
02:14:48,649 --> 02:14:58,689
The little ones ones with a smaller design game doesn't

1779
02:14:58,689 --> 02:14:59,090
have candy.

1780
02:14:59,090 --> 02:14:59,890
You don't know that yet.

1781
02:15:02,420 --> 02:15:17,119
We just started playing it and it's like Beach, you know,

1782
02:15:17,920 --> 02:15:19,020
wait, I can combine.

1783
02:15:25,659 --> 02:15:26,460
I need to combine.

1784
02:15:39,039 --> 02:15:40,439
Yeah, it's summertime.

1785
02:15:42,479 --> 02:15:43,380
It's nice out.

1786
02:15:46,529 --> 02:15:49,029
Somebody said check your CPU and GPU usage to make sure

1787
02:15:49,029 --> 02:15:54,390
this is not a oh, oh, come on, please.

1788
02:15:54,489 --> 02:15:55,390
No, that's it.

1789
02:15:55,989 --> 02:16:00,489
Things just can't be fun and simple with like a cool

1790
02:16:00,489 --> 02:16:09,369
mechanic shit.

1791
02:16:09,369 --> 02:16:09,970
This is gonna be hard.

1792
02:16:20,729 --> 02:16:21,430
Did I get them all?

1793
02:16:21,829 --> 02:16:22,630
I think it is right.

1794
02:16:25,130 --> 02:16:25,529
I did.

1795
02:16:25,529 --> 02:16:26,130
I got everybody.

1796
02:16:27,170 --> 02:16:28,569
Can I combine the big Turtles?

1797
02:16:36,590 --> 02:16:38,489
Oh, almost three.

1798
02:16:43,049 --> 02:16:43,450
All right.

1799
02:16:43,649 --> 02:16:45,649
Well, I think I'm almost at the end of the demo.

1800
02:16:45,649 --> 02:16:46,850
Let's do we'll do one or two more.

1801
02:16:47,450 --> 02:16:47,950
I like it.

1802
02:16:48,250 --> 02:16:49,450
Three big ones makes a bigger one.

1803
02:16:56,600 --> 02:16:59,399
Yeah, almost 90% of you guys like Turtles.

1804
02:17:00,200 --> 02:17:01,500
You'll be buying this game when it comes up.

1805
02:17:01,899 --> 02:17:02,600
I guarantee it.

1806
02:17:08,360 --> 02:17:10,559
And then a year after this comes out, you're still going

1807
02:17:10,559 --> 02:17:11,760
to be listening to the soundtrack.

1808
02:17:13,420 --> 02:17:18,219
And then your YouTube history will be Turtles Steam OST.

1809
02:17:19,219 --> 02:17:27,620
You can't fool me.

1810
02:17:37,879 --> 02:17:39,479
Get a game over before you stop playing.

1811
02:17:40,479 --> 02:17:41,680
Yeah, that sounds fair.

1812
02:17:44,709 --> 02:17:49,500
We do have a lot more to go through which we don't have

1813
02:17:49,500 --> 02:17:50,500
to do all of them, right?

1814
02:17:53,239 --> 02:17:55,440
It's not like, oh my God, we have to play every single demo.

1815
02:17:55,540 --> 02:17:56,440
This is just a cool.

1816
02:17:57,040 --> 02:17:58,139
I like this event a lot.

1817
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:05,200
It makes it so stuff that I never would have even cared

1818
02:18:05,200 --> 02:18:05,600
about.

1819
02:18:05,799 --> 02:18:08,100
It's just I'm going to try it because it's just there.

1820
02:18:09,979 --> 02:18:12,680
It's just available and you can just get it and try it

1821
02:18:13,180 --> 02:18:14,280
and the games aren't out yet.

1822
02:18:14,479 --> 02:18:17,180
I would probably be less excited about this event if the

1823
02:18:17,180 --> 02:18:19,180
games that you could download were games that were like,

1824
02:18:19,180 --> 02:18:20,180
oh, they've been out already.

1825
02:18:20,780 --> 02:18:21,579
But these are most of these.

1826
02:18:21,579 --> 02:18:23,079
I think all of them are not out yet.

1827
02:18:23,780 --> 02:18:24,479
That's really cool.

1828
02:18:26,180 --> 02:18:28,280
It's like a little little taste like a little sneak peek.

1829
02:18:30,120 --> 02:18:30,920
I got to combine some.

1830
02:18:30,920 --> 02:18:31,120
Yeah.

1831
02:18:33,729 --> 02:18:34,129
All right, give me that.

1832
02:18:34,129 --> 02:18:34,930
Let's combine the big ones.

1833
02:18:37,690 --> 02:18:38,090
Shit.

1834
02:18:42,100 --> 02:18:42,700
Oh shit.

1835
02:18:43,399 --> 02:18:43,799
Fine.

1836
02:19:14,129 --> 02:19:15,030
Hey, what's going on here?

1837
02:19:16,610 --> 02:19:17,209
That's three.

1838
02:19:19,399 --> 02:19:19,799
That was three.

1839
02:19:19,799 --> 02:19:20,299
What happened?

1840
02:19:26,040 --> 02:19:26,639
I missed an egg.

1841
02:19:28,579 --> 02:19:29,280
I can't miss an egg.

1842
02:19:30,280 --> 02:19:31,780
Why did the three big ones not combine?

1843
02:19:40,200 --> 02:19:41,200
Oh fuck you.

1844
02:19:43,370 --> 02:19:44,370
I shouldn't even come back down here.

1845
02:20:01,260 --> 02:20:02,260
So why won't they combine?

1846
02:20:05,340 --> 02:20:06,139
There's three in a row.

1847
02:20:06,639 --> 02:20:16,879
Too big.

1848
02:20:16,879 --> 02:20:18,180
I thought the big ones could combine too.

1849
02:20:26,090 --> 02:20:27,489
And this is temporary assets.

1850
02:20:29,459 --> 02:20:30,959
So you tell me this game is only going to get better.

1851
02:20:35,709 --> 02:20:36,510
All right, this last one.

1852
02:20:39,209 --> 02:20:41,209
Oh, that's the pattern for the big ones.

1853
02:20:41,209 --> 02:20:41,610
I get it.

1854
02:20:41,909 --> 02:20:43,010
So it's got to be in like a triangle.

1855
02:20:47,860 --> 02:20:49,659
Yeah, games get scores for different reasons.

1856
02:20:51,479 --> 02:20:55,809
If I give this like a four three, which I'm not going to,

1857
02:20:55,809 --> 02:20:58,809
but if I do and the game I played before this was like a

1858
02:20:58,809 --> 02:21:00,909
four two or something.

1859
02:21:01,209 --> 02:21:04,280
Remember this is based on it.

1860
02:21:04,479 --> 02:21:05,379
It's like a four.

1861
02:21:05,979 --> 02:21:07,379
It's a four point one.

1862
02:21:08,180 --> 02:21:09,979
For the genre that it is in.

1863
02:21:10,879 --> 02:21:14,180
This does not mean that this game is better than any of the

1864
02:21:14,180 --> 02:21:15,979
more elaborate demos we've played.

1865
02:21:16,379 --> 02:21:20,680
This is a four point one in the category of puzzle fun kids

1866
02:21:20,680 --> 02:21:23,079
based children's type games.

1867
02:21:24,180 --> 02:21:24,579
You know what I mean?

1868
02:21:24,579 --> 02:21:27,680
Like entertainment E for everyone puzzle like kids can

1869
02:21:27,680 --> 02:21:29,180
play it old people can play it.

1870
02:21:29,180 --> 02:21:29,780
I can play it.

1871
02:21:29,780 --> 02:21:30,579
You can play it.

1872
02:21:30,979 --> 02:21:33,680
20 year olds can play it 40 year olds can play E for everybody.

1873
02:21:39,149 --> 02:21:40,549
I think I think I'm in trouble here.

1874
02:21:41,250 --> 02:22:08,370
Go faster.

1875
02:22:09,270 --> 02:22:10,370
I'm doing fine.

1876
02:22:16,659 --> 02:22:16,860
Yeah.

1877
02:22:16,860 --> 02:22:17,659
No, not even kids.

1878
02:22:17,760 --> 02:22:18,360
Not even kids game.

1879
02:22:18,360 --> 02:22:21,159
I'm just saying like an anybody can play it and enjoy it anybody

1880
02:22:21,959 --> 02:22:28,299
going to go this way.

1881
02:22:29,399 --> 02:22:30,399
No, I gotta wrap around.

1882
02:22:34,840 --> 02:22:36,340
I would rather just go crawl on the beach.

1883
02:22:38,340 --> 02:22:38,639
Yeah.

1884
02:22:38,639 --> 02:22:40,739
Okay, so go to the beach then.

1885
02:22:42,239 --> 02:22:42,540
Why?

1886
02:22:42,540 --> 02:22:43,040
Why is that?

1887
02:22:43,040 --> 02:22:44,940
Why do you have to have one or the other?

1888
02:22:47,290 --> 02:22:48,489
Nah, dude, I don't want to play this.

1889
02:22:48,489 --> 02:22:49,889
I'd rather go to the beach instead.

1890
02:22:50,889 --> 02:22:51,889
You can still do that.

1891
02:22:51,889 --> 02:22:53,090
You don't have to just not go.

1892
02:22:53,090 --> 02:22:53,590
What do you mean?

1893
02:22:53,790 --> 02:22:57,389
Why are you choosing to go to the beach or play this game?

1894
02:22:58,889 --> 02:23:00,690
No, I'd rather go to the art.

1895
02:23:03,719 --> 02:23:03,920
All right.

1896
02:23:03,920 --> 02:23:05,719
Let me make a big one a really big one.

1897
02:23:08,620 --> 02:23:09,020
Boom.

1898
02:23:10,360 --> 02:23:10,659
Nice.

1899
02:23:10,659 --> 02:23:10,959
All right.

1900
02:23:10,959 --> 02:23:11,559
I got a huge one.

1901
02:23:25,079 --> 02:23:30,780
How come I'm not seeing like pepe D's and shit really?

1902
02:23:31,680 --> 02:23:35,780
I want to see fun pepe dancing emotes because that's what belongs

1903
02:23:35,780 --> 02:23:36,079
here.

1904
02:23:40,290 --> 02:23:41,190
Yeah, that's what I want.

1905
02:23:52,270 --> 02:23:53,270
That looks so funny.

1906
02:23:58,190 --> 02:24:00,090
Like why would you be that excited to dance to this?

1907
02:24:01,360 --> 02:24:02,860
Everyone's having such a good time.

1908
02:24:03,159 --> 02:24:03,860
That's so cute.

1909
02:24:03,860 --> 02:24:04,459
I love it.

1910
02:24:13,600 --> 02:24:14,799
This is psychotic.

1911
02:24:14,899 --> 02:24:15,600
How is this?

1912
02:24:15,899 --> 02:24:17,299
How is this psychotic?

1913
02:24:18,690 --> 02:24:21,090
People are dancing to a fun song.

1914
02:24:32,950 --> 02:24:34,950
I'm so distracted by the dancing.

1915
02:24:39,219 --> 02:24:42,020
I feel like the dancing is getting faster when I look over here.

1916
02:24:43,090 --> 02:24:44,690
It looks like the dancing is getting faster.

1917
02:24:50,180 --> 02:24:51,379
No, oh God.

1918
02:24:53,680 --> 02:24:54,879
Oh, I can't see.

1919
02:25:07,719 --> 02:25:09,420
We're just fucking doing a move.

1920
02:25:13,040 --> 02:25:14,340
It is getting faster.

1921
02:25:14,340 --> 02:25:15,440
You're freaking me out.

1922
02:25:17,760 --> 02:25:19,360
It actually is getting faster.

1923
02:25:25,579 --> 02:25:26,180
No, get down.

1924
02:25:26,180 --> 02:25:26,479
Get down.

1925
02:25:26,479 --> 02:25:26,680
Get down.

1926
02:25:26,680 --> 02:25:26,979
Get down.

1927
02:25:30,340 --> 02:25:30,840
Fuck.

1928
02:25:31,340 --> 02:25:32,440
Oh my God.

1929
02:25:33,139 --> 02:25:34,239
I didn't do that on purpose.

1930
02:25:34,239 --> 02:25:34,940
I swear to God.

1931
02:25:40,309 --> 02:25:42,510
Fucking music is freaking me out.

1932
02:25:48,149 --> 02:25:50,149
Okay, now it is psychotic.

1933
02:25:56,219 --> 02:25:56,620
You guys.

1934
02:26:14,180 --> 02:26:14,680
All right, I got it.

1935
02:26:38,270 --> 02:26:38,969
I'm losing my mind.

1936
02:26:38,969 --> 02:26:41,569
I can't I honestly I keep looking over there and it's making it worse.

1937
02:27:09,559 --> 02:27:10,260
Get over here.

1938
02:27:12,799 --> 02:27:13,600
Okay, I'm good.

1939
02:27:13,600 --> 02:27:14,000
Nice.

1940
02:27:31,260 --> 02:27:32,059
It's 4.1.

1941
02:27:34,120 --> 02:27:35,020
This one's 4.1.

1942
02:27:35,420 --> 02:27:36,020
Absolutely.

1943
02:27:38,690 --> 02:27:39,389
Without a doubt.

1944
02:27:41,989 --> 02:27:42,790
Very cool.

1945
02:27:44,860 --> 02:27:45,459
There it is.

1946
02:27:46,760 --> 02:27:47,760
There's turtles.

1947
02:27:48,760 --> 02:27:51,059
Wish listable on Steam right now.

1948
02:28:16,479 --> 02:29:26,649
I just wanted to just fuck with you for a second.

1949
02:29:27,049 --> 02:29:28,250
All right, that was turtles.

1950
02:29:29,250 --> 02:29:29,750
What else we got?

1951
02:29:29,750 --> 02:29:30,250
Let's take a look.

1952
02:29:32,219 --> 02:29:34,319
Turtles with an exclamation point.

1953
02:29:35,020 --> 02:29:36,520
Turtles exclamation point.

1954
02:29:37,319 --> 02:29:40,620
That's very very I'm sure if you probably type in turtles, you probably wouldn't get it.

1955
02:29:43,879 --> 02:29:46,879
What else we got on that list of action games?

1956
02:29:47,280 --> 02:29:51,579
Let's take a look.

1957
02:29:55,479 --> 02:29:56,780
This is also open world stuff too.

1958
02:30:00,180 --> 02:30:00,879
Turtles.

1959
02:30:02,969 --> 02:30:03,969
Bloodhound.

1960
02:30:06,819 --> 02:30:08,719
This looks like another kind of shooter game.

1961
02:30:09,620 --> 02:30:11,020
Scrap Riders.

1962
02:30:13,590 --> 02:30:14,290
Is this a beat-em-up?

1963
02:30:18,100 --> 02:30:18,899
Less FPS.

1964
02:30:19,500 --> 02:30:20,399
Yeah, we've done a lot of FPS.

1965
02:30:20,399 --> 02:30:20,899
That's right.

1966
02:30:24,459 --> 02:30:26,360
Is this game is FPS but looks good.

1967
02:30:28,799 --> 02:30:29,100
No.

1968
02:30:29,100 --> 02:30:30,700
Okay, what about it's like another page.

1969
02:30:31,100 --> 02:30:36,090
What is this a cooking game?

1970
02:30:37,600 --> 02:30:38,299
Fribbles.

1971
02:30:40,799 --> 02:30:41,500
Crafting.

1972
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:43,600
Agriculture creature collection.

1973
02:30:53,649 --> 02:30:55,450
I think I'm gonna I think I'm gonna click on this one.

1974
02:30:56,090 --> 02:30:56,290
Hold on.

1975
02:30:56,290 --> 02:30:57,190
Let's not go too hasty.

1976
02:30:57,190 --> 02:30:57,489
Hold on.

1977
02:30:58,870 --> 02:31:00,069
Westwood shadows.

1978
02:31:00,170 --> 02:31:00,870
Survival Horror.

1979
02:31:05,219 --> 02:31:06,020
This is FPS.

1980
02:31:07,399 --> 02:31:08,399
Oddworld.

1981
02:31:09,459 --> 02:31:10,659
There's a new Oddworld coming out.

1982
02:31:13,979 --> 02:31:14,479
Okay.

1983
02:31:16,020 --> 02:31:16,920
Astronite.

1984
02:31:17,790 --> 02:31:18,690
Looks pretty cool.

1985
02:31:19,360 --> 02:31:22,159
Sort of retro Game Boy style 2D game.

1986
02:31:22,950 --> 02:31:23,950
Play Slayers X.

1987
02:31:23,950 --> 02:31:24,450
Well, hold on.

1988
02:31:25,760 --> 02:31:27,260
I just want to take a look at a few pages.

1989
02:31:29,979 --> 02:31:30,979
Far Star.

1990
02:31:33,440 --> 02:31:34,739
Panic Porcupine.

1991
02:31:35,860 --> 02:31:37,159
This is like a Son of the Hedgehog game.

1992
02:31:40,840 --> 02:31:42,040
It says difficult.

1993
02:31:42,139 --> 02:31:43,239
It says difficult.

1994
02:31:45,290 --> 02:31:46,590
Panic Porcupine.

1995
02:31:48,700 --> 02:31:49,200
Okay.

1996
02:31:52,600 --> 02:31:53,600
Ooh, parkour.

1997
02:31:54,260 --> 02:31:54,959
This could be fun.

1998
02:31:55,559 --> 02:31:56,360
I might puke though.

1999
02:31:56,659 --> 02:32:00,620
It's a 2D game.

2000
02:32:01,579 --> 02:32:02,379
Dread Haunt.

2001
02:32:06,159 --> 02:32:07,260
Take a couple pages.

2002
02:32:07,260 --> 02:32:07,659
Hold on.

2003
02:32:10,959 --> 02:32:12,260
Undead Pixelmonks.

2004
02:32:13,959 --> 02:32:15,059
Gust of Wind.

2005
02:32:19,620 --> 02:32:20,420
I see stealth there.

2006
02:32:20,420 --> 02:32:21,319
I'm not sure I want to click it.

2007
02:32:22,510 --> 02:32:23,510
It looks pretty cool though.

2008
02:32:26,629 --> 02:32:27,629
Kingdom Gun.

2009
02:32:32,370 --> 02:32:33,170
Zolotl.

2010
02:32:36,930 --> 02:32:37,930
Fight of Steel.

2011
02:32:39,090 --> 02:32:40,290
Whoa, what is this?

2012
02:32:42,020 --> 02:32:44,020
You make your own cyber fighter?

2013
02:32:45,719 --> 02:32:46,120
Maybe.

2014
02:32:49,840 --> 02:32:51,440
EXP War Trauma.

2015
02:32:52,799 --> 02:32:54,000
Psychological Horror.

2016
02:32:54,700 --> 02:32:56,500
Goodbye, Dr. Sanchez.

2017
02:32:59,579 --> 02:33:00,180
Mythic.

2018
02:33:02,870 --> 02:33:03,270
All right.

2019
02:33:03,270 --> 02:33:03,469
All right.

2020
02:33:03,469 --> 02:33:04,270
I don't want to get overwhelmed.

2021
02:33:08,079 --> 02:33:08,780
What is this?

2022
02:33:13,590 --> 02:33:14,790
Zombies and keys.

2023
02:33:14,790 --> 02:33:15,190
All right.

2024
02:33:15,790 --> 02:33:16,489
Let me go back.

2025
02:33:18,329 --> 02:33:19,329
We're going to do Flibbles.

2026
02:33:20,129 --> 02:33:21,030
Yeah, Flibbles time.

2027
02:33:21,030 --> 02:33:21,430
Let's go.

2028
02:33:22,750 --> 02:33:24,149
That's the one I'm most interested in right now.

2029
02:33:31,389 --> 02:33:32,790
You're going to get a minor F here.

2030
02:33:37,090 --> 02:33:38,190
And then maybe I'll go to...

2031
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:40,899
I want this so much.

2032
02:33:41,500 --> 02:33:42,000
Why haven't I...

2033
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:43,700
Why did I not do this for the last two weeks?

2034
02:33:44,950 --> 02:33:45,950
I was busy, whatever.

2035
02:33:46,969 --> 02:33:48,170
Now I'm going to be busy this week.

2036
02:33:48,270 --> 02:33:50,370
This like next six or seven days too.

2037
02:33:51,280 --> 02:33:52,280
A lot of stuff going on.

2038
02:33:53,370 --> 02:33:54,069
Not just in...

2039
02:33:54,870 --> 02:33:57,270
Kind of the stream world, but in my personal life too.

2040
02:33:58,510 --> 02:34:00,010
A lot of things I need to do.

2041
02:34:01,129 --> 02:34:01,829
It's very busy.

2042
02:34:06,469 --> 02:34:07,870
You look like Giga Chad today.

2043
02:34:13,659 --> 02:34:14,360
I don't think so.

2044
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:19,799
Okay, we're good to go.

2045
02:34:27,579 --> 02:34:29,180
Flibbles.

2046
02:34:37,370 --> 02:34:40,670
Are you guys ready for Flibbles?

2047
02:34:44,440 --> 02:34:46,139
Whoa, this is actually weird.

2048
02:34:47,139 --> 02:34:47,540
Look at this.

2049
02:34:53,739 --> 02:34:54,239
Weird.

2050
02:34:55,579 --> 02:34:56,979
Oh, this is weird.

2051
02:34:57,079 --> 02:34:57,579
Okay.

2052
02:34:57,579 --> 02:34:58,379
Should I use the controller?

2053
02:34:59,809 --> 02:35:00,309
Let's turn the...

2054
02:35:00,309 --> 02:35:01,409
All right, settings.

2055
02:35:07,860 --> 02:35:08,559
Can I do it from here?

2056
02:35:16,459 --> 02:35:16,760
How do I...

2057
02:35:16,959 --> 02:35:18,709
How do I turn the audio down?

2058
02:35:19,610 --> 02:35:20,409
Oh, should the audio...

2059
02:35:20,709 --> 02:35:23,809
The audio is not coded into the game yet.

2060
02:35:25,290 --> 02:35:26,590
Okay, so I do have to do this.

2061
02:35:45,559 --> 02:35:46,159
That's better.

2062
02:35:51,920 --> 02:35:53,520
So I cannot change this.

2063
02:35:53,520 --> 02:35:54,319
It's probably very, very...

2064
02:35:54,319 --> 02:35:55,319
It's probably very early.

2065
02:35:57,379 --> 02:35:58,379
All right, let's go Flibbles.

2066
02:36:00,760 --> 02:36:02,260
I have really high hopes for Flibbles.

2067
02:36:02,260 --> 02:36:03,260
Come on, look at this.

2068
02:36:03,260 --> 02:36:04,059
This is perfect.

2069
02:36:04,840 --> 02:36:05,739
Come on, Flibbles.

2070
02:36:10,540 --> 02:36:11,040
Continue.

2071
02:36:11,040 --> 02:36:11,739
I didn't do anything.

2072
02:36:13,120 --> 02:36:13,520
New game.

2073
02:36:19,709 --> 02:36:21,110
All right, both headphones going for this.

2074
02:36:31,680 --> 02:36:32,680
This music.

2075
02:36:40,120 --> 02:36:41,319
Wait, I can actually hold on.

2076
02:36:42,610 --> 02:36:43,209
Interact?

2077
02:36:45,680 --> 02:36:46,079
How do I...

2078
02:36:46,979 --> 02:36:47,780
Oh, okay.

2079
02:36:48,379 --> 02:36:48,979
Forward?

2080
02:36:52,739 --> 02:36:53,239
It's a five.

2081
02:36:53,639 --> 02:36:54,440
It's starting at five.

2082
02:36:55,940 --> 02:36:58,739
Protect at least 50 tomatoes from the evil goo.

2083
02:37:00,319 --> 02:37:02,120
Fish three Flibbles from the fountain.

2084
02:37:02,120 --> 02:37:03,920
Finish the level in less than nine minutes.

2085
02:37:12,069 --> 02:37:12,469
Okay.

2086
02:37:15,549 --> 02:37:16,350
We're gonna do controller.

2087
02:37:20,739 --> 02:37:21,340
Escape.

2088
02:37:21,540 --> 02:37:25,239
Open task, move, aim, interact, jump, look around, throw, shoot.

2089
02:37:25,940 --> 02:37:26,540
Dash.

2090
02:37:26,739 --> 02:37:27,639
Interact with Flibbles.

2091
02:37:36,559 --> 02:37:37,559
I can dash?

2092
02:37:39,770 --> 02:37:40,770
Interact with the crates.

2093
02:37:42,250 --> 02:37:43,149
Where are the crates?

2094
02:37:49,620 --> 02:37:50,620
I can't, man.

2095
02:37:53,159 --> 02:37:54,459
Okay, interact with the crates.

2096
02:37:54,459 --> 02:37:55,260
Where are the crates?

2097
02:37:56,299 --> 02:37:56,700
Over here.

2098
02:38:01,579 --> 02:38:02,879
Aim with up and down.

2099
02:38:02,879 --> 02:38:03,780
Okay, aim.

2100
02:38:08,520 --> 02:38:10,420
Why do I have dynamite?

2101
02:38:19,879 --> 02:38:21,280
Why would I do that?

2102
02:38:22,409 --> 02:38:24,909
Craft dynamite in the crafting menu.

2103
02:38:27,649 --> 02:38:28,149
Dude.

2104
02:38:29,340 --> 02:38:30,540
What are you talking about?

2105
02:38:31,760 --> 02:38:33,059
Why would I want to make dynamite?

2106
02:38:44,200 --> 02:38:46,500
You've got a friend in me.

2107
02:38:47,879 --> 02:38:49,379
Got a friend in me.

2108
02:38:50,440 --> 02:38:51,239
To people.

2109
02:38:52,180 --> 02:38:54,979
Having one of a life and I have...

2110
02:38:55,280 --> 02:38:56,079
That's it, right?

2111
02:39:03,620 --> 02:39:05,620
Somebody post the lyrics in the chat right now.

2112
02:39:05,620 --> 02:39:06,120
I'll do it.

2113
02:39:07,180 --> 02:39:07,979
Post the lyrics.

2114
02:39:08,079 --> 02:39:08,879
I don't care if it's spam.

2115
02:39:08,879 --> 02:39:09,479
Don't give a shit.

2116
02:39:09,680 --> 02:39:11,680
Post the lyrics to the song and I'll do it.

2117
02:39:15,709 --> 02:39:15,909
All right.

2118
02:39:15,909 --> 02:39:16,809
I'm going off cam for this.

2119
02:39:17,309 --> 02:39:18,209
Give me the lyrics of the song.

2120
02:39:20,559 --> 02:39:22,559
Actually, can one of the mods do it in the mod chat?

2121
02:39:22,959 --> 02:39:23,860
Yeah, guys, you don't do it.

2122
02:39:23,860 --> 02:39:24,260
Don't do it.

2123
02:39:24,260 --> 02:39:24,559
I'll do it.

2124
02:39:24,559 --> 02:39:25,860
Somebody in the mod chat do it.

2125
02:39:27,469 --> 02:39:29,569
Just like copy the text and paste it.

2126
02:39:34,920 --> 02:39:35,620
Oh, hold on.

2127
02:39:35,620 --> 02:39:36,620
I can't see this.

2128
02:39:40,700 --> 02:39:41,500
I'm going to try.

2129
02:39:41,600 --> 02:39:42,200
Here we go.

2130
02:39:46,860 --> 02:39:48,260
Wait, I'll get on the next cycle.

2131
02:39:55,440 --> 02:39:56,440
Me, me, me, me, me, me.

2132
02:40:04,420 --> 02:40:06,620
You got a friend in me.

2133
02:40:08,700 --> 02:40:11,399
You've got a friend in me.

2134
02:40:14,010 --> 02:40:15,610
Where the road looks.

2135
02:40:16,280 --> 02:40:22,079
Rubber head and you're miles and miles from your nice woman.

2136
02:40:23,479 --> 02:40:27,180
You just remember what your old pal said.

2137
02:40:27,180 --> 02:40:30,579
But you've got a friend in me.

2138
02:40:31,899 --> 02:40:35,299
You've got a friend in me.

2139
02:40:37,340 --> 02:40:39,639
You've got, they say it this many times.

2140
02:40:39,739 --> 02:40:40,940
He says it this many times.

2141
02:40:42,780 --> 02:40:44,079
You got troubles.

2142
02:40:44,780 --> 02:40:46,280
I've got them too.

2143
02:40:46,379 --> 02:40:50,979
There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you.

2144
02:40:52,340 --> 02:40:55,840
We stick together and see it through.

2145
02:40:55,940 --> 02:40:59,340
Cause you've got a friend in me.

2146
02:41:00,739 --> 02:41:09,680
Yeah, you've some other some other folks might be a little bit

2147
02:41:09,680 --> 02:41:10,879
smarter than I am.

2148
02:41:11,819 --> 02:41:14,020
Bigger and stronger too.

2149
02:41:15,309 --> 02:41:20,219
Maybe but none of them ever will ever love you.

2150
02:41:20,719 --> 02:41:21,120
What?

2151
02:41:21,819 --> 02:41:22,620
The what though?

2152
02:41:22,719 --> 02:41:23,520
That's what he says.

2153
02:41:24,120 --> 02:41:25,420
The way I do.

2154
02:41:25,420 --> 02:41:27,620
It's me and you.

2155
02:41:28,020 --> 02:41:30,920
And as the years go by.

2156
02:41:32,549 --> 02:41:34,649
Our friendship will never die.

2157
02:41:35,860 --> 02:41:39,360
You're gonna see it's our destiny.

2158
02:41:50,610 --> 02:41:51,510
That laugh that lyric.

2159
02:41:51,510 --> 02:41:52,809
No one's ever gonna love you.

2160
02:41:53,110 --> 02:41:53,909
What the hell?

2161
02:41:55,389 --> 02:41:55,889
I'm back.

2162
02:42:01,680 --> 02:42:02,680
You're hurting us.

2163
02:42:05,520 --> 02:42:05,819
All right.

2164
02:42:05,819 --> 02:42:06,819
So I have dynamite.

2165
02:42:06,819 --> 02:42:08,020
What do I do with the dynamite?

2166
02:42:11,760 --> 02:42:13,360
Craft on me in the crafting machine.

2167
02:42:13,360 --> 02:42:13,760
All right.

2168
02:42:24,239 --> 02:42:24,540
Okay.

2169
02:42:24,540 --> 02:42:24,940
How are you?

2170
02:42:24,940 --> 02:42:25,639
How do I turn it on?

2171
02:42:35,139 --> 02:42:49,030
Wait, what do I do with all this?

2172
02:42:52,329 --> 02:42:53,329
What do I do with this?

2173
02:42:57,879 --> 02:42:59,579
I put it in the crafting machine.

2174
02:43:01,860 --> 02:43:03,059
Does anybody know what to do?

2175
02:43:13,340 --> 02:43:15,940
Use the diamond to fish for flibble shoot with left of right

2176
02:43:15,940 --> 02:43:16,440
trigger.

2177
02:43:20,600 --> 02:43:22,000
Do I light the fuse?

2178
02:43:32,860 --> 02:43:33,860
What do I do with this stuff?

2179
02:43:34,540 --> 02:43:35,739
Fish for flibbles?

2180
02:43:45,729 --> 02:43:46,829
You have to craft it first.

2181
02:43:46,829 --> 02:43:47,329
Didn't I just do?

2182
02:43:47,329 --> 02:43:50,100
Okay, so okay crafting machine.

2183
02:43:50,100 --> 02:43:59,379
So I put this in here and then one of these things here and

2184
02:43:59,379 --> 02:44:01,079
then it's going to spit out a dynamite.

2185
02:44:01,079 --> 02:44:02,379
Okay, I have a dynamite now.

2186
02:44:03,319 --> 02:44:05,420
Now I can will this explode if I throw it?

2187
02:44:11,989 --> 02:44:12,690
How do I turn it on?

2188
02:44:15,610 --> 02:44:33,239
I can go fish for where I fish for them into the phone.

2189
02:44:35,860 --> 02:44:36,860

Mana that has not been picked up decays over time.

2373
03:01:10,729 --> 03:01:14,420
Oh, I don't.

2374
03:01:14,819 --> 03:01:15,819
Wait, I don't have any what?

2375
03:01:17,200 --> 03:01:17,799
I have no ammo.

2376
03:01:18,399 --> 03:01:31,709
Shotgun.

2377
03:01:51,870 --> 03:01:52,270
Bug.

2378
03:02:03,379 --> 03:02:05,280
Is that the villagers from Minecraft?

2379
03:02:06,420 --> 03:02:07,020
I'm almost dead.

2380
03:02:12,059 --> 03:02:12,959
Something weird in that water.

2381
03:02:12,959 --> 03:02:14,260
I'm not much of a swimmer though.

2382
03:02:15,250 --> 03:02:16,049
Something weird.

2383
03:02:17,350 --> 03:02:17,850
Let's taste it.

2384
03:02:21,030 --> 03:02:21,829
Tastes fine to me.

2385
03:02:32,270 --> 03:02:32,870
Can I pick it up?

2386
03:02:32,870 --> 03:02:33,569
What's going on?

2387
03:02:42,319 --> 03:02:44,719
Walk up and press E on pink flowers to heal.

2388
03:02:46,389 --> 03:02:47,090
Respawn point.

2389
03:02:50,940 --> 03:02:52,639
So this is my menu.

2390
03:02:54,280 --> 03:02:54,879
All right, let's go.

2391
03:02:56,059 --> 03:03:03,920
Whoa, okay.

2392
03:03:26,700 --> 03:03:27,399
All right, I get it up.

2393
03:03:29,030 --> 03:03:29,729
Shotgun shells.

2394
03:03:29,729 --> 03:03:30,329
Thank you.

2395
03:03:44,010 --> 03:03:44,510
That hurts.

2396
03:03:44,610 --> 03:03:45,209
I'm gonna die.

2397
03:04:05,909 --> 03:04:07,610
That's how much health Croft had.

2398
03:04:07,909 --> 03:04:09,010
Is that how much health he had?

2399
03:04:10,280 --> 03:04:11,280
Oh my God.

2400
03:04:14,399 --> 03:04:14,899
I got this.

2401
03:04:14,899 --> 03:04:15,500
I'm doing it again.

2402
03:04:17,000 --> 03:04:40,319
I'm in the wall.

2403
03:04:50,549 --> 03:04:51,649
Fuck, I'm gonna die again.

2404
03:04:58,719 --> 03:04:59,319
What is this?

2405
03:05:12,940 --> 03:05:13,340
I don't know.

2406
03:05:13,340 --> 03:05:14,040
I can't use a spell.

2407
03:05:14,040 --> 03:05:14,739
I don't have any mana.

2408
03:06:11,399 --> 03:06:13,299
Stop fucking reloading and shoot the guy.

2409
03:06:28,340 --> 03:06:28,940
That was fun.

2410
03:06:31,219 --> 03:06:31,719
Heal up.

2411
03:06:32,549 --> 03:06:32,850
Good.

2412
03:06:33,549 --> 03:06:34,049
Let's keep going.

2413
03:06:37,620 --> 03:06:38,420
You dropping anything else?

2414
03:06:40,329 --> 03:06:40,729
What game is this?

2415
03:06:40,729 --> 03:06:42,229
This is called Frog Monster.

2416
03:06:44,110 --> 03:06:44,909
Frog Monster.

2417
03:06:45,979 --> 03:06:47,379
Found a piece of mana upgrade.

2418
03:06:48,510 --> 03:06:48,909
I'll take it.

2419
03:06:52,190 --> 03:06:53,790
Okay, go back down.

2420
03:07:07,799 --> 03:07:08,700
Yeah, what's this called?

2421
03:07:08,700 --> 03:07:10,100
It's called, it's got stars with a V, right?

2422
03:07:11,340 --> 03:07:13,040
So cubes when you put them all together.

2423
03:07:14,440 --> 03:07:17,739
So the V of, I cannot think of it.

2424
03:07:18,239 --> 03:07:18,940
Voxel, yeah.

2425
03:07:25,940 --> 03:07:26,639
This is cute.

2426
03:07:29,010 --> 03:07:30,309
No, not virgin.

2427
03:07:31,110 --> 03:07:37,069
Well, this is pretty.

2428
03:08:07,049 --> 03:08:08,549
This is, this is nice.

2429
03:08:09,049 --> 03:08:09,850
This is nice.

2430
03:08:14,579 --> 03:08:40,690
These are kind of shrooms that you smoke.

2431
03:08:41,690 --> 03:08:42,889
But you don't smoke mushrooms.

2432
03:08:42,889 --> 03:08:43,889
You don't smoke shrooms.

2433
03:08:43,889 --> 03:08:45,190
I don't know what the hell you're talking about.

2434
03:08:53,000 --> 03:08:53,600
You get to live.

2435
03:08:54,200 --> 03:09:01,809
How does he know?

2436
03:09:03,840 --> 03:09:05,340
Why wouldn't I know that?

2437
03:09:11,750 --> 03:09:12,549
Ooh, cool.

2438
03:09:28,809 --> 03:09:29,309
Shit.

2439
03:09:30,909 --> 03:09:36,520
All right, one more try.

2440
03:09:36,620 --> 03:09:36,920
That's it.

2441
03:09:37,420 --> 03:09:38,219
I'm done with this one.

2442
03:09:38,620 --> 03:09:39,020
One more try.

2443
03:09:41,190 --> 03:09:42,389
You suck at this game.

2444
03:09:42,989 --> 03:09:44,090
The game is kind of tricky.

2445
03:09:54,569 --> 03:09:55,270
One more try and that's it.

2446
03:10:27,440 --> 03:10:29,940
Environments are beautiful and the gameplay has a lot of potential.

2447
03:10:30,139 --> 03:10:32,639
Sound design and music need a lot of, need a lot of work.

2448
03:10:33,780 --> 03:10:34,479
I would agree with that.

2449
03:10:36,250 --> 03:10:36,750
But here's the thing.

2450
03:10:37,649 --> 03:10:38,950
And this is something that's really important.

2451
03:10:41,549 --> 03:10:42,850
It's if you really think about it.

2452
03:10:42,850 --> 03:10:46,549
It's probably less than five to ten people doing this.

2453
03:10:48,659 --> 03:10:51,059
So that's why all these games, right?

2454
03:10:51,360 --> 03:10:52,159
Well, most of them, right?

2455
03:10:54,680 --> 03:10:58,180
You are never going to hear me say like, oh, wow.

2456
03:10:58,979 --> 03:11:00,680
This game's fucking awful, right?

2457
03:11:00,680 --> 03:11:01,479
Like why would I do that?

2458
03:11:02,479 --> 03:11:06,079
It takes a lot of fucking guts to kind of put yourself out there

2459
03:11:06,079 --> 03:11:06,780
and do this kind of shit.

2460
03:11:06,979 --> 03:11:07,379
It does.

2461
03:11:08,379 --> 03:11:09,780
And if you only have like a few people,

2462
03:11:12,420 --> 03:11:14,020
like especially if it's only one or two people.

2463
03:11:17,090 --> 03:11:19,790
I mean, this is, this is remarkable for it being a small team, right?

2464
03:11:21,190 --> 03:11:23,690
Yeah, you got to, I don't want, here's the thing.

2465
03:11:24,889 --> 03:11:29,090
I think discouraging people from doing something that they, that they're

2466
03:11:29,090 --> 03:11:30,590
like passionate about and they think is cool.

2467
03:11:30,889 --> 03:11:31,690
And this is good.

2468
03:11:31,690 --> 03:11:32,889
This is actually fucking good.

2469
03:11:35,219 --> 03:11:37,819
I wouldn't be able to do something like this, even if I really spent time on it.

2470
03:11:38,719 --> 03:11:43,620
I don't ever want anyone to think that like, oh, my game's fucking bad.

2471
03:11:44,420 --> 03:11:44,920
Oh shit.

2472
03:11:44,920 --> 03:11:48,020
No, I don't want somebody to, I don't want to like rain on somebody's passion,

2473
03:11:48,020 --> 03:11:51,520
rain on somebody's, you know, way they try to make a living and everything, right?

2474
03:11:52,020 --> 03:11:52,819
I'm not going to do that.

2475
03:11:55,430 --> 03:11:57,229
Could this game use a little work?

2476
03:11:57,530 --> 03:11:59,530
Yeah, it absolutely fucking could.

2477
03:12:01,360 --> 03:12:03,760
But I think it's fun.

2478
03:12:04,760 --> 03:12:05,860
I think this is good shit.

2479
03:12:08,969 --> 03:12:09,969
A little bit more time in the oven.

2480
03:12:09,969 --> 03:12:11,270
This thing can be fucking fantastic.

2481
03:12:15,340 --> 03:12:15,639
Now.

2482
03:12:15,639 --> 03:12:15,940
Yes.

2483
03:12:15,940 --> 03:12:17,139
You've heard me say, yeah.

2484
03:12:17,139 --> 03:12:17,440
All right.

2485
03:12:17,440 --> 03:12:17,739
Hold on.

2486
03:12:18,040 --> 03:12:20,440
But like fuck Capcom is a little different.

2487
03:12:21,780 --> 03:12:25,180
It's not, that's not like three people making Resident Evil 8.

2488
03:12:25,579 --> 03:12:25,979
Okay.

2489
03:12:29,200 --> 03:12:31,799
There's not one guy didn't make Resident Evil 8.

2490
03:12:33,719 --> 03:12:35,819
If they did, holy shit.

2491
03:12:35,819 --> 03:12:37,219
That would be a crowning achievement.

2492
03:12:54,239 --> 03:12:54,840
Yeah.

2493
03:12:54,940 --> 03:12:58,340
This is, this is, this is a time for us to come together as gamers.

2494
03:12:58,940 --> 03:12:59,540
I'm a gamer.

2495
03:12:59,639 --> 03:13:00,139
Don't forget.

2496
03:13:02,190 --> 03:13:05,190
And celebrate all the cool shit that people are making.

2497
03:13:05,190 --> 03:13:06,389
That's a coming up, right?

2498
03:13:10,370 --> 03:13:14,069
So I'm, the rating system is more of a joke than anything else.

2499
03:13:14,969 --> 03:13:16,569
I don't, it's not actually accurate, right?

2500
03:13:16,569 --> 03:13:17,469
Cause this is a demo.

2501
03:13:17,469 --> 03:13:18,069
This is not like it.

2502
03:13:19,500 --> 03:13:21,399
It's not like this is the full experience.

2503
03:13:21,399 --> 03:13:23,399
Some of these games are a year away.

2504
03:13:24,500 --> 03:13:26,000
Just admit that you hate this.

2505
03:13:26,600 --> 03:13:26,899
What?

2506
03:13:26,899 --> 03:13:27,500
I don't.

2507
03:13:27,899 --> 03:13:28,700
Oh, you know, you didn't say this.

2508
03:13:28,700 --> 03:13:30,100
You said that you hate video games.

2509
03:13:30,299 --> 03:13:31,500
You know, I kind of do.

2510
03:13:32,600 --> 03:13:33,500
I kind of do.

2511
03:13:33,500 --> 03:13:33,899
Okay.

2512
03:13:41,840 --> 03:13:45,170
Same, same, same.

2513
03:13:45,170 --> 03:13:45,469
All right.

2514
03:13:45,469 --> 03:13:47,670
So we're going to, we, we agree then we, we agree.

2515
03:13:59,219 --> 03:13:59,520
All right.

2516
03:13:59,520 --> 03:13:59,920
Last try.

2517
03:13:59,920 --> 03:14:00,219
That's it.

2518
03:14:01,520 --> 03:14:10,879
We're going to actually try this one now.

2519
03:14:10,879 --> 03:14:11,180
Okay.

2520
03:14:11,180 --> 03:14:16,829
Hold on geeks.

2521
03:14:19,829 --> 03:14:21,930
Why do you have to be such a positive Peter?

2522
03:14:23,010 --> 03:14:25,010
I'm really not even a positive Peter.

2523
03:14:25,510 --> 03:14:27,409
You guys have been here for a long time.

2524
03:14:28,510 --> 03:14:33,450
I'm not really positive Peter.

2525
03:14:34,450 --> 03:14:46,700
He's a positive Peter.

2526
03:14:46,700 --> 03:14:50,370
Come on.

2527
03:14:53,840 --> 03:15:00,059
No, I cannot reliably tell you that a game is good or bad based

2528
03:15:00,059 --> 03:15:02,059
on a 15 minute demo.

2529
03:15:02,659 --> 03:15:03,459
That's impossible.

2530
03:15:03,760 --> 03:15:04,360
That's not possible.

2531
03:15:06,299 --> 03:15:13,559
I actually like what I'm doing.

2532
03:15:15,059 --> 03:15:22,200
This game is called Frog Monster.

2533
03:15:22,799 --> 03:15:23,299
One word.

2534
03:15:25,040 --> 03:15:26,139
Turn the music down a little.

2535
03:15:28,040 --> 03:15:30,280
There we go.

2536
03:15:30,280 --> 03:15:37,979
That's kind of the point of a demo to see if you like it.

2537
03:15:39,899 --> 03:15:47,049
Oh, yeah.

2538
03:15:48,950 --> 03:15:49,750
Don't die, please.

2539
03:15:53,700 --> 03:15:58,360
Smash, smash, smash, smash, smash.

2540
03:15:59,260 --> 03:15:59,360
All right.

2541
03:15:59,360 --> 03:15:59,760
That's it.

2542
03:16:00,260 --> 03:16:00,860
That was fun.

2543
03:16:00,959 --> 03:16:02,879
That was called Frog Monster.

2544
03:16:03,979 --> 03:16:04,979
It's somewhere in the threes.

2545
03:16:05,780 --> 03:16:08,579
I actually like the death screen.

2546
03:16:08,579 --> 03:16:09,079
I think it's cool.

2547
03:16:09,579 --> 03:16:19,649
I come in next.

2548
03:16:20,450 --> 03:16:26,379
We've got, uh, please do Slayers X.

2549
03:16:26,979 --> 03:16:27,479
I will.

2550
03:16:32,250 --> 03:16:33,049
Oh, cat, right.

2551
03:16:34,350 --> 03:16:41,600
Grand Theft Gato, Vice Kitty.

2552
03:16:42,840 --> 03:16:43,440
The graphics up.

2553
03:16:43,440 --> 03:16:44,040
I think this is good.

2554
03:16:44,040 --> 03:16:44,540
How does this work?

2555
03:16:44,540 --> 03:16:45,040
Press B to meow.

2556
03:16:45,040 --> 03:16:46,040
Good cats can navigate.

2557
03:16:46,040 --> 03:17:15,629
Press M to view the local map.

2558
03:17:15,629 --> 03:17:23,280
Holy shit.

2559
03:17:23,280 --> 03:17:23,780
This is a whole city.

2560
03:17:23,780 --> 03:17:24,280
Okay.

2561
03:17:24,280 --> 03:17:38,719
Hi, it's great to see you.

2562
03:17:38,719 --> 03:17:39,219
You can really get hungry earning likes and subscribers.

2563
03:17:39,219 --> 03:17:39,719
We're out of food again.

2564
03:17:39,719 --> 03:17:46,409
I'll get it.

2565
03:17:46,409 --> 03:17:46,909
The downstairs door is locked.

2566
03:17:46,909 --> 03:17:47,409
We're trapped in here.

2567
03:17:47,409 --> 03:17:47,909
Man is too tired to shop.

2568
03:17:47,909 --> 03:17:48,409
Maybe he needs some candy.

2569
03:17:48,409 --> 03:17:48,909
Okay.

2570
03:17:48,909 --> 03:17:49,409
Man is too tired to shop.

2571
03:17:49,409 --> 03:17:51,040
Maybe he needs some candy.

2572
03:17:51,040 --> 03:17:51,540
Man is too tired to shop.

2573
03:17:51,540 --> 03:17:52,040
Man is too tired to shop.

2574
03:17:52,040 --> 03:17:52,540
Man is too tired to shop.

2575
03:17:52,540 --> 03:17:53,040
Man is too tired to shop.

2576
03:17:53,040 --> 03:17:58,459
Man is too tired to shop.

2577
03:17:58,459 --> 03:17:58,959
Man is too tired to shop.

2578
03:17:59,360 --> 03:17:59,860
Okay.

2579
03:18:15,459 --> 03:18:16,459
Binding human ten candy.

2580
03:18:18,459 --> 03:18:24,659
There's candy in the box.

2581
03:18:24,659 --> 03:18:25,159
Okay.

2582
03:18:25,159 --> 03:18:44,940
All right, here's candy.

2583
03:18:44,940 --> 03:18:45,940
Talk to Ricky.

2584
03:18:52,579 --> 03:18:53,079
He'll go shopping soon.

2585
03:18:53,079 --> 03:18:54,079
Now there's a cat downstairs he wants to talk to you.

2586
03:18:54,079 --> 03:18:55,579
Let's go.

2587
03:18:56,579 --> 03:18:57,079
The fuck.

2588
03:18:57,079 --> 03:18:57,579
And what do you do?

2589
03:18:57,579 --> 03:18:58,579
WHAT?!

2590
03:19:02,049 --> 03:19:16,129
Get the hell away from me! This guy's going to kick me? What the fuck? Oh my god, I'm on his head!

2591
03:19:16,930 --> 03:19:31,469
What the fuck is happening? Get this guy out of here! Am I ready? Find the strange cat. Okay.

2592
03:19:32,270 --> 03:19:42,319
Ponzilla. Want some sick power-ups? Yes. Okay, ever heard of XP? It piles up as you do awesome,

2593
03:19:42,319 --> 03:19:48,030
but it's useless by itself. You gotta spend it, cat. Open your inventory and look at the upper

2594
03:19:48,030 --> 03:20:08,719
left corner. Oh, okay. What did I just do? Are those hairballs? I'm not big, but you need me.

2595
03:20:08,719 --> 03:20:13,739
Okay, what do I need? Ever seen your journal? It's how you avoid getting lost. Open it with J.

2596
03:20:14,780 --> 03:20:31,809
Okay. In your journal, you can manage tasks. Click a finished one to get XP. Oh, all right. Okay. Yes.

2597
03:20:31,809 --> 03:20:39,200
Love cheese, I guess. Beep boop wrong. You didn't use J to read the task. What? I can't stand this

2598
03:20:39,200 --> 03:20:42,639
stuff. Why is my name Mouse3 anyway? This world makes no sense. All right, let's go.

2599
03:20:43,520 --> 03:21:03,600
Find Trinikitty next. She will help you with your skills. Wait, are you ready? I believe.

2600
03:21:04,239 --> 03:21:24,959
Climb the bookcase over there, jump at it, left click and hold. How? What the fuck? I got the

2601
03:21:24,959 --> 03:21:50,670
candy. You gotta- I can climb anything? Okay, I can climb anything. Find the strange cat. You can

2602
03:21:50,670 --> 03:22:11,329
climb anything. Are you the strange cat? What does that sound? What? How much for level one melee?

2603
03:22:11,329 --> 03:22:20,139
Um, how do I- what do I do? How do I see that? How do I get that menu? How do I get to that menu?

2604
03:22:29,569 --> 03:22:42,670
50. Okay, got it. All right, I gotta find the strange cat downstairs. How do I get downstairs?

2605
03:22:43,229 --> 03:23:01,629
There we go. Malthus. Okay. Talk to my crew. They will show you the way to the outside world.

2606
03:23:03,360 --> 03:23:10,100
My crew is on the second floor. I can only give you the keys to the door. You must walk

2607
03:23:10,100 --> 03:23:16,260
through it. Find Mayor Mittens and your destiny. Open your inventory and equip the keys.

2608
03:23:18,860 --> 03:23:46,780
Okay. How do I get out of here? I'm out. Let's go. Can you drive a car? Can I drive a car?

2609
03:23:48,430 --> 03:24:10,219
What the fuck? You can drive a car? Why can I drive a car? Dirty whiskers. Sorry, you know,

2610
03:24:10,219 --> 03:24:15,649
this is the demo, but hey, what's the next best thing to owning the game? Wish listing it on

2611
03:24:15,649 --> 03:24:19,250
Steam because that's where all the stuff is coming out. Don't you want to do it? I'm not

2612
03:24:19,250 --> 03:24:21,649
going to click that because I think it might actually do it. I don't know. I'm afraid to

2613
03:24:21,649 --> 03:24:45,659
like click that button. All right, so where do I go? Oh, no, don't ghost ride the car.

2614
03:24:55,059 --> 03:25:51,600
Funk music? Did I kill that guy? What's going on here? Okay. All right. Well, what's going on

2615
03:25:51,600 --> 03:26:05,469
here? What happened? What's it? Diesel tools? Wait, maybe you can tell me. Give me fuel. Give me fire.

2616
03:26:09,870 --> 03:26:17,840
They're cheering on a race? Oh, okay. Let's go. You ready? Three, two, one, go.

2617
03:26:26,000 --> 03:26:29,040
The car I'm telling right now. Give me the controller. I think it's probably going to be

2618
03:26:29,040 --> 03:27:03,229
easier. Nope. I died. I can't jump. Oh, wait, somebody here. All right. There's Mayor Mittens.

2619
03:27:04,770 --> 03:27:12,500
Okay. Here we go. You want to work for me? Yes. Oh my God. A lackey of my own. You've made it.

2620
03:27:13,299 --> 03:27:19,780
Okay. Right. Work. To be my helper, you need wheels. There's a small car to your right.

2621
03:27:20,420 --> 03:28:00,510
Go take it for a small car. Okay. Hi Ed. W A S D to drive. Yeah, this is a why does it keep

2622
03:28:00,510 --> 03:28:18,059
cycling through gears? The car doesn't sound right. I'm not even holding the acceleration.

2623
03:28:18,860 --> 03:28:48,940
Well, to be fair, a cat wouldn't know how to use a manual. I mean, not yet. Oh, I gotta do one, two,

2624
03:28:49,020 --> 03:29:08,590
three, four, five. Okay. Two. Where's three? Where's three?

2625
03:29:26,590 --> 03:29:32,059
I know not yet. I'm trying to go over here. It's way too dank.

2626
03:29:32,780 --> 03:30:09,100
All right. The turning is a little slow. Don't. Okay. Four, five, six. Four, five, six.

2627
03:30:10,450 --> 03:30:21,969
No way. That was six. All right. What do you need, Mittens? Okay. We're over the big time.

2628
03:30:21,969 --> 03:30:27,229
I got some real work now. It's gonna be intense. Get ready. Person was making a tree for it and

2629
03:30:27,229 --> 03:30:32,829
now they're stuck in the tree. Crazy day, right? I need to go get them down. Fire cats are already

2630
03:30:32,829 --> 03:30:37,860
there to help. Jump, hold, attack the human's back and hold down the button. You can drive

2631
03:30:37,860 --> 03:31:01,629
him around like that. Okay. Over there. All right. Let's go. Where's my car? I don't need a car.

2632
03:31:01,629 --> 03:31:41,870
Why can't this guy get down? I don't understand why you can't get down. Okay. Let's go.

2633
03:31:41,870 --> 03:32:00,370
Oh, you're welcome. What game is this? The game is called Grand Theft Gato Vice Kitty.

2634
03:32:06,540 --> 03:32:14,139
Okay. Signed up my amazing helper cat. Your reward is a new toy. Maybe it's a gun, a pack,

2635
03:32:14,139 --> 03:32:20,690
a thingy. Okay. Works in a garage over by the apartments. Tell him I'm counting on his vote.

2636
03:32:20,690 --> 03:32:33,680
Okay. Let's move. This gets at least five letter grades because of the title. Oh, give me this car.

2637
03:32:49,540 --> 03:33:09,170
Wait, where is this? Oh, it's right here. Okay. I made something amazing. Cat pack 9,000.

2638
03:33:09,889 --> 03:33:29,979
Assemble the pieces. Okay. I yawned, but I don't want to be yawning on camera. Don't

2639
03:33:29,979 --> 03:33:44,159
fucking drive off the edge. I got another one. It's fine. All right. Find the pieces.

2640
03:33:44,879 --> 03:33:54,930
End of the stream voice. No, no, I'm fine. I'll go refill my tea. Wait, where is this stuff?

2641
03:33:55,809 --> 03:34:10,579
Wait, was it right next to me? T means he's going to go smoke a bowl.

2642
03:34:11,459 --> 03:34:31,809
Where is this stuff? Oh, it's up here. I don't smoke. I don't smoke weed. I eat it.

2643
03:34:33,040 --> 03:34:49,760
I like it better. You know why I like to eat it, by the way, if you have, you know, you know,

2644
03:34:49,760 --> 03:34:54,399
and you're over 21, you know, it's illegal in your area and you just be careful. All things in

2645
03:34:54,399 --> 03:35:00,959
moderation. When I smoke weed, I don't like how fast smoking weed hits you. And then it's just gone.

2646
03:35:02,819 --> 03:35:11,059
It's like, boom, it's an absolute explosion. Just and then it's gone in like 30 minutes.

2647
03:35:12,799 --> 03:35:20,100
I like the feeling of letting it kind of work up for an hour or two. And then you can stay in that

2648
03:35:20,100 --> 03:35:31,620
kind of mellow state, whatever you want to be in for a few hours. I like it. That's why I like to

2649
03:35:31,620 --> 03:35:47,059
eat it. 30 minutes. It's like four hours for me. Um, I don't have very much experience with smoking.

2650
03:35:47,059 --> 03:35:52,020
I'd rather eat it. So but the few times I've done it, it was just like, so I was like, too,

2651
03:35:52,020 --> 03:35:56,739
too much. And it just hit me like a truck for like half an hour to an hour. And then you just have

2652
03:35:56,739 --> 03:36:03,340
to come down. I feel a little I know a lot of people the opposite, where it's like, if you take

2653
03:36:03,340 --> 03:36:09,819
a view, eat it. And all of a sudden, you're you don't want to be high for four or five hours,

2654
03:36:09,819 --> 03:36:14,209
right? Because that's sometimes if you do a lot of edibles or whatever that can happen.

2655
03:36:14,209 --> 03:36:35,920
And I get that I get it completely. How do I get on the roof? It's also what your body's used to.

2656
03:36:35,920 --> 03:36:46,559
Yeah, that's true. How do I get on the roof? Edibles can really sneak up on you. Yes, they can.

2657
03:36:46,559 --> 03:37:01,229
That's why you should really be very careful with it. It really depends on the person. Oh, yeah.

2658
03:37:03,170 --> 03:37:10,799
If you like smoking it versus eating it. Absolutely. All right, I'm done. We're gonna

2659
03:37:10,799 --> 03:37:18,399
do another one. Actually, let me get some tea. I need to perk up a little. I need to pick me up.

2660
03:37:20,159 --> 03:37:26,420
That was Grand Theft Gato Vice Kitty. It was pretty fun. I think I like I think the music's

2661
03:37:26,420 --> 03:37:32,860
part of my favorite part. I'll be right back and refill my water. Get some tea with it. I'll see in

2662
03:37:32,860 --> 03:38:16,829
like two, three minutes, maybe five minutes. BRB. I'm still here. I just wanted to somebody mentioned

2663
03:38:16,829 --> 03:38:24,079
the so what the when I when I get tea, some of the time I get something called liquid IV.

2664
03:38:24,959 --> 03:38:27,760
And somebody said be careful those things like 100 milligrams of caffeine.

2665
03:38:28,399 --> 03:38:32,719
See, I do this. This is my tactic with it. I usually only do half a packet.

2666
03:38:33,440 --> 03:38:40,610
I usually do about it's about 40 milligrams of caffeine. Liquid IV is amazing. Yes.

2667
03:38:41,329 --> 03:38:52,500
It's got a kind of a strange name. Not 100 milligrams of THC. What the fuck are you talking

2668
03:38:52,500 --> 03:38:55,780
about? No, no, no, no, no, no. We're talking about two completely different things.

2669
03:38:56,579 --> 03:39:04,690
Let me separate this out. The powder that I use is green tea powder, right? This matcha powder.

2670
03:39:06,219 --> 03:39:15,299
And this liquid IV is the name of the brand or whatever. It's like a little packet. 100 milligrams

2671
03:39:15,299 --> 03:39:23,819
of caffeine is not that big of a deal. Cup of coffee is what 80 70 to 90. So that's not a big

2672
03:39:23,819 --> 03:39:36,139
deal. One cup of coffee is less than 100. A little bit less than 100. Something between 40 50 60.

2673
03:39:37,600 --> 03:39:44,620
Regular green tea is 30. Yeah, no, I am not drinking. Let me be really clear about this.

2674
03:39:44,620 --> 03:39:49,489
I really like these things. They've been I've been drinking a lot of them over the last few

2675
03:39:49,489 --> 03:39:58,780
months. Maybe like I don't do it every day. Maybe like once every once every three or four days,

2676
03:39:58,780 --> 03:40:06,139
once every five days. So once a week, twice a week. But here's the thing. You do one packet

2677
03:40:06,139 --> 03:40:16,590
over the course of like pretty much a whole day, which ends up being about the equivalent of maybe

2678
03:40:16,590 --> 03:40:31,940
two cups of coffee. But I like it a lot. I really do. No, no, no, no. Yeah, it's electrolytes too.

2679
03:40:31,940 --> 03:40:43,459
Yeah. Essentially, it's kind of like a Gatorade with green tea powder and caffeine in it.

2680
03:40:43,459 --> 03:40:48,450
So if I don't match a powder like green tea powder is only like 30 milligrams.

2681
03:40:49,500 --> 03:40:55,979
If I really need something, I'll drink one of these liquid IVs. Yeah, I'm talking about caffeine.

2682
03:41:01,340 --> 03:41:06,579
Yeah, no, no, no, no. This stuff is no. Trust me, I wouldn't drink this if I didn't think it was

2683
03:41:06,579 --> 03:41:18,479
any good. This is an ad. No, no, I just actually drink these matches. Not that high in caffeine

2684
03:41:18,479 --> 03:41:26,559
isn't the green tea is 30 milligrams of caffeine. Some people drink a bunch of monster a day. Yeah,

2685
03:41:26,559 --> 03:41:29,680
I always try to stay. I know I'm supposed to be leaving, supposed to get out of here.

2686
03:41:30,399 --> 03:41:38,590
But I really realistically, real talk, I've tried to cut a lot of the coffee I drink a day.

2687
03:41:40,059 --> 03:41:49,170
So I typically will replace coffee with one of these green tea drinks. And it's yeah, you know,

2688
03:41:49,170 --> 03:41:59,760
still has caffeine, but it's fine. And the company in general, too, I like looked into the company

2689
03:41:59,760 --> 03:42:07,100
too. I think they're at least what they claim. They try to be sustainable and stuff. So that's

2690
03:42:07,100 --> 03:42:20,559
cool. Don't leave. How is this not an ad? I'm not being paid to tell you this. This is something

2691
03:42:20,559 --> 03:42:28,700
that I literally do on a weekly basis. I mean, could it be an ad? Sure. I mean, yeah, I guess so.

2692
03:42:29,340 --> 03:42:43,629
Have you ever had matcha ice cream? Oh, yeah. I became a green tea Andy over the last six months.

2693
03:42:43,629 --> 03:43:08,559
I love it. You should email them thoughts on coffee ice cream. I got okay, I gotta go. But

2694
03:43:08,559 --> 03:43:12,959
yeah, sponsorships and, you know, advertisement type shit. You guys know that I'm

2695
03:43:13,840 --> 03:43:24,319
evolved is working on that stuff. So I don't know. That'd be kind of cool. I mean, I actually use it.

2696
03:43:28,159 --> 03:43:42,260
Get a matcha sponsor. No, no. All right. I actually BRBS in a minute. Wait, somebody raided? What

2697
03:43:42,260 --> 03:43:48,100
happened? Can I wait, wait, wait. Somebody actually raided. Who raided? I can't see it.

2698
03:43:48,100 --> 03:44:04,219
This is a big raid. I can't even see who it is. Who is it? Big balls raid. Big balls. Big balls.

2699
03:44:05,020 --> 03:44:13,180
Um, thanks a lot. Big balls. I appreciate it. Everybody coming over. Thanks for the raid.

2700
03:44:13,819 --> 03:44:22,739
Hold on. Are you guys making this up? I saw a lot of like big balls, big balls and like, hey,

2701
03:44:22,739 --> 03:44:35,760
we're here. I don't know. I don't understand. Hold on. Let me look at my dashboard. I got,

2702
03:44:35,840 --> 03:44:44,420
yeah, I got trolled. I didn't. Yeah, I seriously did. Yeah, that's okay. Yeah, there's no raid.

2703
03:44:44,420 --> 03:50:24,989
Okay. All right. I'll be right back. Bye. What's up? How you doing? The big balls raid was real.

2704
03:50:26,110 --> 03:50:41,090
Yeah. From beta 64. Oh, cool. All right. So it was real. Well, thanks for doing it. Welcome guys.

2705
03:50:52,190 --> 03:50:58,739
You pissed on a raid? What? No, I didn't. I even asked and I looked. What are you talking about?

2706
03:50:58,739 --> 03:51:20,530
You're so high. You keep laughing like Seth Rogen. Such a specific. I'm not even sure if it's an

2707
03:51:20,530 --> 03:51:26,610
insult or not, but in a specific comment. Okay, let's go. What else was it? What was the other

2708
03:51:26,610 --> 03:51:39,739
one I downloaded? There's one more. What did I have queued up? Pi. Oh, the pirate game. Right.

2709
03:51:39,739 --> 03:52:03,040
Turn that off. Get it open. Very cool. This game is very bright. It's very colorful. Just wanted

2710
03:52:03,040 --> 03:52:36,030
to warn you. Why is all this off? Oh, sorry. Okay. All this is turned off. I don't know why.

2711
03:52:36,750 --> 03:52:57,280
You guys ready for the pirate bay? Pirates Bay. Pirates Bay. Let's go. New game. You can roll to

2712
03:52:57,280 --> 03:53:11,469
avoid damage. Probably controller, right? Yeah. Control scheme. Change the controller. Okay.

2713
03:53:11,469 --> 03:53:24,209
That's jump. Crouch. Oh, F1. That's going to be different. All right. That's dodge. This is a

2714
03:53:24,209 --> 03:53:38,479
dodge roll or dodge roll. Use. Move. Hide. Change. Target. Aim. Attack. Oh, shit. That's block.

2715
03:53:39,200 --> 03:54:00,299
All right. We'll figure it out. Talk. A. Talk. Talk. A. A. A. All right. What is it over here?

2716
03:54:00,299 --> 03:54:14,430
E. What's up? I don't want to spend any money right now. No. Is there a sprint? Okay. Just

2717
03:54:14,430 --> 03:54:32,340
checking to see what happened. Am I holding my head underwater? How do I get back up? I just want to

2718
03:54:32,340 --> 03:54:39,459
see if he died if he jumped in the water. Where do I go? Where do I go to get up from here?

2719
03:54:46,670 --> 03:54:59,200
All right. Use ladder. There we go. Oh, yeah. That was quick. Okay. So now what do I do?

2720
03:55:04,559 --> 03:55:33,440
Put the sails up. All right. Let's move. Let's go for it. Can I steer? Let's go. Let's go. We're

2721
03:55:33,440 --> 03:56:00,829
going to that island right there. Open your sails. Oh, shit. All right. Now let's go. Am I steering?

2722
03:56:00,829 --> 03:56:20,290
How do you steer? Okay. We're going to do a keyboard. You only have one person on this

2723
03:56:20,290 --> 03:56:32,579
whole crew. I would be freaking out if I saw this coming into the port. How do you... Is there a

2724
03:56:32,579 --> 03:56:41,889
break? All right. How do you... So I made it this town. How do I stop the boat from moving?

2725
03:56:42,690 --> 03:57:11,709
I need to put the anchor out? Where's the anchor? There's no... There's no brake pedal, dude. Oh,

2726
03:57:11,709 --> 03:57:50,030
drop anchor. I got way anchor. Wait. Okay. I got to get closer. Why do I need a crew? I need... I

2727
03:57:50,030 --> 03:57:55,860
can't just do this by myself. I need to take a cigar out of my mouth. Be like, all right, hoist

2728
03:57:55,860 --> 03:58:02,500
the sails. Why am I doing this by myself? Oh, fuck. We're getting in... We're coming in hot.

2729
03:58:11,329 --> 03:58:36,430
All right. Stop. There we go. That's not going anywhere, right? No, we're good. This guy looks

2730
03:58:36,430 --> 03:58:46,420
like he's waiting for me. What do I get? I want a weapon. Is this a hostile territory? I have no

2731
03:58:46,420 --> 03:59:01,420
idea. Is this a hostile territory for me? I don't think so. Oh, wait. What's up there? Okay.

2732
03:59:02,139 --> 03:59:09,940
Oh, a pirate. Want to see my weapons and ammo for sale. Okay. You've got a saber, musket,

2733
03:59:10,659 --> 03:59:16,590
blunderbuss. That's actually a lot of weapons. All right. I need... I need like a thousand bucks.

2734
03:59:17,229 --> 03:59:30,159
Thousand bucks. I think it's like a quest up here. All right. What is that? See? 20 meters.

2735
03:59:30,719 --> 03:59:54,579
I'm going that way. Your boat is floating away. No, it's not. Do I need to kill this guy? Hello,

2736
03:59:54,579 --> 03:59:58,340
traveler. Have you heard of the legends of the most terrifying pirates of these seas?

2737
03:59:58,340 --> 04:00:03,489
I can tell you where to find them for a small fee. And if you beat them, your profit will be

2738
04:00:03,489 --> 04:00:18,940
much larger. Okay. Where is the rogue admiral? Thank you. Let's go get him. All right. Where's

2739
04:00:18,940 --> 04:00:30,350
my... All right. Where's my... That's such a scam. Oh, there we go. No. Oh, there we go. Okay. Over

2740
04:00:30,350 --> 04:00:42,979
there. 1,700 meters that way. Yeah. I spent all my money, but I'm going to get... I'm going to go

2741
04:00:42,979 --> 04:00:51,299
here. I'm going to get my... I'm going to kill this guy. Get a bounty for it. I thought that was just

2742
04:00:51,299 --> 04:01:03,569
rolling credits. I was like, we're getting credits already? Did I run out of time? That's not my

2743
04:01:03,569 --> 04:01:18,340
boat right there, right? That's not my boat, right? No, that's my boat. Brawl demo time, right? Yeah.

2744
04:01:18,340 --> 04:01:37,340
That's how I was like... Right over to the music. This thing's in sync, right? What's the game? The

2745
04:01:37,340 --> 04:01:52,219
game is called Pirate Bay. Pirates Bay. Part of the Steam demo week. Go check it out if you think

2746
04:01:52,219 --> 04:01:58,020
it's cool. You don't have... It's literally free. You don't have to do anything, but just install

2747
04:01:58,020 --> 04:02:25,260
the game. That's it. Okay. Let's go find this guy. 1,800 meters this way. All right. Full speed ahead.

2748
04:02:25,819 --> 04:03:04,540
I just... I... Somebody just talked about my beard. They don't like it. They don't like it.

2749
04:03:05,180 --> 04:03:22,459
Well, I'm shaving today, so... All right. Let's do it. Let's get him. I don't have any weapons.

2750
04:03:23,180 --> 04:03:52,100
How am I going to fight this guy? He's on this island. I'll just beat his ass. It's fine.

2751
04:04:05,659 --> 04:04:14,700
Self-overcorrecting. I've never driven a sail... a boat like... a ship like this before. Sorry. I'm

2752
04:04:14,700 --> 04:04:28,030
overdoing it. Yeah, there's rain too. There's weather. Okay. I'm going to... Here's my approach.

2753
04:04:28,670 --> 04:04:47,100
Put down the anchor. There's a campfire right there. He's definitely right there. Oh, shit.

2754
04:04:47,100 --> 04:05:27,790
It's a crewmate. I have no stamina. Can I take this guy's shit? All right. Give me your sword.

2755
04:05:27,790 --> 04:05:36,700
Can I loot him? No, I can't. Okay. What? This guy's naked. This guy's naked. Wait. Why is there a

2756
04:05:36,700 --> 04:05:45,600
naked skeleton? Wait. What's going on? The other skeleton. The other guy had clothes on. Wait.

2757
04:05:45,600 --> 04:05:51,299
Chest. Chest or chest? Right here. Come on. Give me a weapon. Give me a sword. Something.

2758
04:05:52,100 --> 04:06:21,889
A thousand bucks. Get the fuck out of here. Leave me alone. Where the fuck are you running to? He's

2759
04:06:21,889 --> 04:06:29,780
got so much health. He's got way too much health. I'm going to drown him. Oh, the skeleton's going

2760
04:06:29,780 --> 04:06:54,379
to fight him? I have an idea. Did they not go in the water? I'm trying to drag him by his feet.

2761
04:06:55,100 --> 04:07:06,860
I'm going to run him over. I'm going to run his ass over. He's got... Look how many people he has.

2762
04:07:06,860 --> 04:07:38,350
This is ridiculous. Hit X to pull a weapon out? No, I don't have any weapons. No, I don't... Wait.

2763
04:07:38,350 --> 04:07:44,989
What? Do I... Was that actually a sword that I have in my inventory? Let's go. Come on. Where is it?

2764
04:07:47,120 --> 04:08:05,170
Don't even... All right. I'm dead. I died. Where do I spawn? Am I still on the island? I do have... I

2765
04:08:05,170 --> 04:08:10,430
have a sword. How do I take it out? All right. Let's go. I think I'm on the same... I think I'm

2766
04:08:10,430 --> 04:08:30,690
on the island still. Is there a map? Yep. I'm still on the island. All right. This guy's dead.

2767
04:08:31,250 --> 04:08:42,049
Is that a foam Minecraft sword or what? Am I going to be able to fight him?

2768
04:09:01,069 --> 04:09:10,780
He killed me again. It's made out of aluminum foil. Well, I'll kill him eventually. I get to keep

2769
04:09:10,780 --> 04:09:22,059
going back. I'll just... Okay. This is a spoiler for a very popular Marvel movie that I'm about

2770
04:09:22,059 --> 04:09:32,180
to spoil. There's a doctor in it. It's a... It's a movie about a doctor and he's weird. Okay.

2771
04:09:36,850 --> 04:09:41,090
I can just... I could just doormar move this guy, right? Like, doesn't matter. I'll come back over

2772
04:09:41,090 --> 04:10:22,530
and over again. Oh, no. I'm dead. Not Morbius. Doormamu. I'm here to bargain. Doormamu. I'm here

2773
04:10:22,530 --> 04:10:36,829
to bargain. Doormamu. R1M? R1? R1? Stop it. I got him. I win. I win. I got 10,000 fucking dollars.

2774
04:10:36,829 --> 04:10:50,049
Who cares if I lost 600? Are you kidding me? All right. Get out. Get out. Get out. What if I

2775
04:10:50,049 --> 04:10:56,260
lose a percentage? It's probably 20%. Yeah. Fuck all these doormamus. I don't care. I'm out.

2776
04:10:57,979 --> 04:11:22,239
This is my boat. Is that my boat? It's not. Well, it is now. Never mind. Where's my boat?

2777
04:11:22,239 --> 04:11:38,979
Is my boat gone? I don't see it anywhere. I think it's actually gone. No, that's not it. Wait. No,

2778
04:11:38,979 --> 04:11:56,750
it's over here. It's on the map. There it is. I wonder if he had any items. There's probably

2779
04:11:56,750 --> 04:12:08,350
stuff here to take, right? Maybe not. Okay. Well, I can buy a gun now. I at least need to see what

2780
04:12:08,350 --> 04:12:21,780
the gun is like. I'd rather watch you eat a jar of mayonnaise. You'd probably rather watch me eat a

2781
04:12:21,780 --> 04:12:35,229
jar of mayonnaise than a lot of stuff. I don't think it matters what we're doing. I think that

2782
04:12:35,229 --> 04:12:42,750
you would probably put that higher on the list because that's weird and crazy and you don't want

2783
04:12:42,750 --> 04:12:59,329
to miss that stream. All right. Uh, I need to get back to, what do I need to go? All right. That was

2784
04:12:59,329 --> 04:13:06,379
fun. That was good. That was called Pirates Bay. That was cool. It's like a single player pirate

2785
04:13:06,379 --> 04:13:18,209
adventure game. Pretty sick. Pretty sick. What else we got? What's the one that everybody keeps

2786
04:13:18,290 --> 04:13:23,840
to? I keep seeing it in chat. I keep seeing people saying this one, this one, this one,

2787
04:13:23,840 --> 04:13:41,549
something with an X in it. Slayers X. Is that on here? What, um, what category? Is it action,

2788
04:13:41,549 --> 04:14:00,620
adventure, simulation, RPG? What is it? Platformer? There's like, I guess I can just type it in. Okay,

2789
04:14:00,620 --> 04:14:26,420
Slayers X. Is this shooter? No, I'm not gonna play this Succubus game. Why would I do that?

2790
04:14:26,420 --> 04:14:59,180
They don't even tell me I'm having problems again with this. Why can't I download it?

2791
04:14:59,180 --> 04:15:22,780
Hold on. Let me try another one. Maintenance? No, it's not. They did maintenance yesterday.

2792
04:15:22,780 --> 04:15:43,469
It's not gonna happen again. What was the other one? What, Celico? Let me try that one. What is

2793
04:15:43,469 --> 04:16:18,670
all this about? This is weird. Um, I can't download anything. My Steam is like, fucked up. Well, um,

2794
04:16:18,670 --> 04:16:37,840
I guess I can open up the Dread X thing again. That's weird. Uh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

2795
04:16:37,840 --> 04:16:44,620
no, I can't download anything on Steam. Oh, wait. Yeah, I can. It just popped back up.

2796
04:16:44,620 --> 04:17:01,969
I think this is actually working. Dude, your chin is huge. Yeah. And guess what? If I have like,

2797
04:17:01,969 --> 04:17:16,239
in a fucking street fight, I just, it's like a bird beak hitting you right in the fucking mouth.

2798
04:17:16,239 --> 04:17:22,500
No, nevermind. I think Steam's fucked up. It looked like I could download it, but I can't.

2799
04:17:22,500 --> 04:17:29,329
Um, I can open Dread X. Play a couple more of those. I was not fair to the Dread X stuff before,

2800
04:17:29,329 --> 04:17:32,770
because I had the internet problems and I was annoyed and pissed off. So we can try some of

2801
04:17:32,770 --> 04:17:43,329
the Dread X stuff. That's sad because I, this is like over soon. All right. Well, whatever.

2802
04:17:43,329 --> 04:17:48,020
You're the comedy relief character that gets killed off. Yeah. Although I know they keep,

2803
04:17:48,020 --> 04:17:52,180
they kind of keep the comedy relief character around long enough to make jokes for the movie.

2804
04:17:52,819 --> 04:18:01,729
So I'd last a little while, I think. I think I'd last a little while.

2805
04:18:02,370 --> 04:18:11,899
Please do some of this stuff for green screen. All right. I'll do the go away,

2806
04:18:11,899 --> 04:18:17,700
go away thing. Are you guys going to have me like get attacked by a bear?

2807
04:18:28,659 --> 04:18:34,819
All right. Uh, let's go play this other thing over here. That was, that was creepy. I like that one.

2808
04:18:36,620 --> 04:18:42,829
They were all pretty good. Dread X. I love this. I love these little like micro games.

2809
04:18:44,049 --> 04:18:48,450
The demo stuff I love because it's like only 20, 30, 40 minutes an hour. It's perfect.

2810
04:18:49,010 --> 04:18:58,129
Tries to be demo Andy for the rest of my life. Okay. Um, let's get out of here.

2811
04:18:58,850 --> 04:19:09,889
What's the, the one that I have downloaded is that sell, sell it go. Let's see if it's any good.

2812
04:19:09,889 --> 04:19:15,729
How much longer are you going to stream? Probably not that much longer. And I really,

2813
04:19:15,729 --> 04:19:23,180
I'm going to disappoint a lot of people here. Unfortunately, I have a lot of stuff to do this

2814
04:19:23,180 --> 04:19:29,760
weekend and into this week. I told you I was going to be kind of erratic with the stream schedule.

2815
04:19:29,760 --> 04:19:33,649
You're not going to see me for a little while. You're not going to see me for like five or six

2816
04:19:33,649 --> 04:19:39,680
days or something. That's why I was so pissed off yesterday because I wanted to stream yesterday

2817
04:19:39,680 --> 04:19:43,040
because I knew I wanted to do two days in a row because I knew I wasn't going to be around.

2818
04:19:43,040 --> 04:19:48,540
That's why I was so mad yesterday afternoon. And I know my voice is junk. I know I'm very aware of

2819
04:19:48,540 --> 04:19:59,500
it. Let's do this though. Let's play this. Sell it go. Hopefully it's not too long.

2820
04:20:02,989 --> 04:20:09,680
Disappointed. What do you mean? Um, I just, I'm really trying to do more than a couple times a

2821
04:20:09,680 --> 04:20:22,959
week. What is this? This is a little, let me see. Okay. So here it is. Welcome to the steam next

2822
04:20:22,959 --> 04:20:28,989
fest demo. It means a lot to us to play this little game of ours. We hope you like it. It's

2823
04:20:28,989 --> 04:20:31,870
been developed for many years and it required a lot of hard work to get here to a point where

2824
04:20:31,870 --> 04:20:35,309
you can confidently hand out a free demo to you. While the development of this game is a lot of

2825
04:20:35,309 --> 04:20:40,909
fun, complete do-overs for the entire game were frequently made. And it took a while till we

2826
04:20:40,909 --> 04:20:44,270
finally had something that we truly believed in. Something that made us go, this is the game that

2827
04:20:44,270 --> 04:20:50,379
I want to spend the next couple of years on. Very fair. Oh, it had a different name. Okay.

2828
04:20:54,610 --> 04:21:01,680
Game's unfinished. The demo has been significantly altered and that's it. Okay. It's a work in

2829
04:21:01,680 --> 04:21:08,719
progress. Yeah. Okay. I get it. Adjust the graphics. Be based on your heart. Please select one of the

2830
04:21:08,719 --> 04:21:19,379
answers below. I have a state of the art gaming PC. 3090. Oh, I thought the game crashed.

2831
04:21:19,379 --> 04:21:42,770
This is Celico. Press any key. Friendly reminder that you have previously set one or more graphics

2832
04:21:42,770 --> 04:21:49,379
to ridiculous. Please be aware that this setting is not optimized for any computer and may cause

2833
04:21:49,379 --> 04:22:02,940
performance and visibility issues. So maybe I should change it. I'll go ahead and change it.

2834
04:22:08,829 --> 04:22:35,309
What a streamer mode. Really? Wow. Reduce screen shake. That's a plus one for me.

2835
04:22:37,149 --> 04:22:40,829
Avoid compression issues. That's a lot of thought that went into that. That's cool.

2836
04:22:42,430 --> 04:22:45,469
I'm going to have to put, okay, yeah, let's do this. Let's put this on just high.

2837
04:22:46,510 --> 04:22:58,340
Where's ridiculous. Okay. Real-time ground ceiling reflections, mirror reflections. That's cool.

2838
04:22:59,299 --> 04:23:07,729
All right. Decal quality. High level of detail. Ultra. I think that's fine.

2839
04:23:08,530 --> 04:23:15,219
It told me not to do this because it's literally impossible for a computer. Sounding things in a

2840
04:23:15,219 --> 04:23:29,780
good spot. Dude, I got it. Okay. Let's give a round of applause. Having a shitload of options,

2841
04:23:30,829 --> 04:23:36,909
even if nobody touches it, is such a huge deal because they might be something that you really

2842
04:23:36,989 --> 04:23:44,139
don't like in a game that you can never take out. But when you have the option to take something out,

2843
04:23:46,670 --> 04:23:53,840
it's just better. Don't applaud it yet. You didn't try it. Hold on. Look at all this stuff.

2844
04:23:53,840 --> 04:23:59,180
Let's see some gameplay. All right. Let's see some gameplay. Let's see some gameplay. Fine.

2845
04:24:00,319 --> 04:24:30,399
Okay. Shouldn't these be the same? Shouldn't these be the same? Horizontal and vertical?

2846
04:24:31,120 --> 04:24:45,280
Not in this game. Really? Huh? Okay. All right. Let's go. Let's see some gameplay. Ensign.

2847
04:24:45,280 --> 04:24:52,450
Lieutenant. Commander. Well, new lieutenant. All right. Here we go. Just play the game. I'm

2848
04:24:52,450 --> 04:24:58,989
just making sure I get it in the right spot. Choose your play style. Well, just a traditional

2849
04:25:00,590 --> 04:25:09,579
rifle. Start each level with only an assault rifle. There's glowing eyes behind you.

2850
04:25:09,579 --> 04:25:16,750
Steam Dome for Celica provides an early look at the game while it's still in development.

2851
04:25:16,750 --> 04:25:21,870
Most story elements will be absent until a later demo update. When's the game actually come out?

2852
04:25:21,870 --> 04:26:05,180
Is there a date? Grab teddy bear. Notepad. Do I have a gun? Evade soldiers and locate a weapon.

2853
04:26:05,180 --> 04:26:20,620
Oh. Lock purple door. Add it to auto. What? Okay. Oh, this is fast. Anything in the trash?

2854
04:26:21,340 --> 04:27:07,069
I can jump? We're in space? All right. Cool. All right. Where do I go? Oh, right here.

2855
04:27:07,069 --> 04:27:28,770
Right here. All right. Go, go, go, go, go, go. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2856
04:27:29,649 --> 04:27:43,379
I need a gun. I need a gun. I need a gun. Gun, gun, gun, gun. Right now. Gun, gun, gun. I need a gun.

2857
04:27:44,020 --> 04:28:41,409
Press E to pick it up. Gun. Gun. Whoa. That animation is cool. The reload animation. It's

2858
04:28:41,409 --> 04:28:47,090
like the FPS is low. It's weird. I like it. I like the reload animation.

2859
04:28:47,489 --> 04:29:11,260
All the animations are interesting. It feels like, um, I'm on just the normal difficulty.

2860
04:29:11,260 --> 04:29:19,219
It feels like, um, like Doom, but it's, it's like a 3D, much cleaner and better looking.

2861
04:29:19,219 --> 04:29:32,290
That's weird. Hard to describe. Oh, there's the key. This was, oh, this was a Doom mod. That's right.

2862
04:29:32,290 --> 04:29:52,739
Holy shit. I read that in the beginning. Data card. Codex. You can now use your wrist codecs

2863
04:29:52,739 --> 04:29:58,420
by pressing caps lock. Powerful information tool. Download a data pad. Contents. All right, cool.

2864
04:30:01,840 --> 04:30:22,319
Well, I think I need that. All right. Uh, one, four, three, two. This game is called

2865
04:30:22,319 --> 04:30:35,709
Celico. S-E-L-A-C-O. Add it to your wish list for the love of God. Whoa. Wait, wait, wait. Don't,

2866
04:30:35,709 --> 04:30:53,729
I don't want to use all my weapons. What's this? Um, oh, it's new info. Cool. So what's the objective

2867
04:30:53,729 --> 04:31:09,790
now? Incoming message. Slide attack. Okay. Nice. All right. Where's, where am I going?

2868
04:31:19,040 --> 04:31:45,149
Cool. All right. Watch out. Don't die. I'm going to, I have one health.

2869
04:31:49,870 --> 04:32:49,229
The enemies are 2D. Cool. Cool. Okay. Back here. More data. What do I do? Door unlocked. Oh,

2870
04:32:49,790 --> 04:32:58,139
oh, you need a cheeseburger. That's cool. Oh, I'm so hungry. Oh my God. I want a cheeseburger. So bad.

2871
04:32:58,139 --> 04:33:24,049
I need a burger right now. Can this open? Eat a whopper? No, I'm not into that right now. Um,

2872
04:33:24,049 --> 04:34:13,919
I went, I'm going backwards a lot. That's a long slide. Challenges. Okay. Cool. Armor lost. Uh,

2873
04:34:13,919 --> 04:34:23,310
this game gets like a five at a five for style. And I mean like a one for gameplay. Cause like,

2874
04:34:23,310 --> 04:34:33,860
how would I have died there? That's impossible. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. It's cool. Uh, this is

2875
04:34:33,939 --> 04:34:56,029
absolutely fine. I love the 2D, 3D. It's so weird. It reminds me of one time I was on family guy.

2876
04:34:56,029 --> 04:35:34,270
What these are slow down, slow down. You made my paper shredder overheat. Why? I didn't,

2877
04:35:34,830 --> 04:35:43,180
I didn't overload your paper shredder. You do up to six sheets at a time. Don't be dumb and do more

2878
04:35:43,180 --> 04:35:52,000
than six sheets. That's the thing that you did. And I know you did, you did like seven or eight

2879
04:35:52,000 --> 04:35:56,080
sheets. You said, ah, well, I don't feel like sitting here and doing six at a time. Fuck it.

2880
04:35:57,470 --> 04:36:27,299
And it went, and then you look like a fool. I mean, it was foolish what you did on lock.

2881
04:37:01,979 --> 04:37:25,630
Lockdown active. Where should I go from here? Somebody's shooting at me from her. This is

2882
04:37:25,630 --> 04:37:42,779
absolutely fucking insane to do. Jeezy doom. What's, what's Jeezy doom is it's just the doom

2883
04:37:42,779 --> 04:37:50,779
engine. Now, wait, wait, wait. Are we talking to the original doom? Just doom one, just doom

2884
04:37:51,580 --> 04:38:10,509
for the Amiga. What? That doesn't make any sense. That doesn't make any sense. This, this, this is,

2885
04:38:10,509 --> 04:38:17,340
how does that make any sense? That's crazy. Can I get in here?

2886
04:38:17,340 --> 04:38:30,860
I can go in there. Hold on. What about over here? I did this. I did that. I'm missing a door or

2887
04:38:30,860 --> 04:38:41,180
something. Well, that's insane. That's remarkable. That's really, really cool. Where's this door? I

2888
04:38:41,180 --> 04:38:47,970
know I'm lost. I know, I know, I know, I know. A key or something. Do I need to open it with

2889
04:38:47,970 --> 04:38:52,860
something? Wow. Where do I go? There's a light behind you. Yeah, I know. It's called a lamp.

2890
04:38:53,740 --> 04:39:03,009
Well, he's only it's this place is in lockdown. Wait, that doesn't mean anything. No, I'm fine.

2891
04:39:03,009 --> 04:39:15,900
What? It's in the middle of the room. Oh, got it. I thought I was just looking for a door.

2892
04:39:21,310 --> 04:39:25,869
That made that makes a lot more sense now that I'm playing this, that this is doom,

2893
04:39:25,869 --> 04:40:07,500
that they just have heavily changed. Happy birthday. Wait, that's who's that? That's me.

2894
04:40:13,700 --> 04:41:03,790
Jesus. Whoa, wait, what? Oh, dude, you should play frog monster. I already did. That game was sick.

2895
04:41:10,849 --> 04:41:24,849
All right. Where should I go from here? Oh, my goodness. I can't tell that was a bad or a good

2896
04:41:24,849 --> 04:41:49,340
idea. I think it was a good idea. What? Where am I? W. Do I have a flashlight? Oh, my God,

2897
04:41:49,340 --> 04:42:28,049
I'm going to drown. Wait, wasn't I up here already? No, I do have a flashlight. All right, good.

2898
04:42:28,049 --> 04:43:07,939
Come get me. Blue cake. Security level three. Camera feeds. It's a lot going on in this game.

2899
04:43:08,580 --> 04:43:18,319
There's a lot going on. That was just a Roomba, but I don't care. It was on the enemy team.

2900
04:43:19,040 --> 04:44:05,520
No. Crap. Use Z for med kit. Oh, my God. I'm dumb. Is there a map? I actually don't know. There might

2901
04:44:05,520 --> 04:44:14,700
be. Your room is really dumb. Yeah, because I was playing scary games earlier and here we are.

2902
04:44:15,259 --> 04:44:22,959
All right. One more attempt and that's it. Then I'm going to call it. I just, I mean, I need a

2903
04:44:22,959 --> 04:44:27,040
cheeseburger. It's so bad. It's like the only thing I care about right now. It's the number one thing

2904
04:44:27,040 --> 04:44:52,669
I care about. Perfect timing. I'm exhausted. Hopefully get some rest. Rest up. Yeah.

2905
04:44:53,549 --> 04:45:24,900
Get some rest. Why not? Those guys hurt a lot. Oh, God. I didn't know you were still here.

2906
04:45:26,900 --> 04:45:36,479
I got to go get some meat in me. I got to get some beef with lettuce. What's my special order?

2907
04:45:36,479 --> 04:46:01,759
My special order. Why am I still moving around? Lettuce. No, jalapenos, grilled onions,

2908
04:46:03,060 --> 04:46:18,130
A1 steak sauce. And that's it. Cheese, grilled onions, jalapenos, A1 steak sauce. Let's get it.

2909
04:46:22,500 --> 04:46:28,619
Oh, an A1 steak sauce. Let's get it. I guess I'm fucking tired.

2910
04:46:31,229 --> 04:46:37,549
Guys, I only put A1 steak sauce on a cheeseburger. That's it. It never goes on anything else.

2911
04:46:41,060 --> 04:46:45,139
I've never had A1 on anything besides a burger. Sometimes when I order a burger,

2912
04:46:46,020 --> 04:46:59,229
they just rename it A1 burger sauce because that's where it belongs. I don't put it on everything.

2913
04:46:59,229 --> 04:47:06,000
I don't put it on everything. No, that'd be gross. All right. That's going to conclude the stream and

2914
04:47:06,000 --> 04:47:15,650
I will see you guys later. Celico. That was really cool. The fact that that's done in a Doom mod

2915
04:47:16,290 --> 04:47:24,819
seems impossible. And that's what makes it so cool. A lot of fun games today. I like this. I don't

2916
04:47:25,139 --> 04:47:31,979
maybe even if it goes away, I might still do it. So you guys, the next time you guys are going to

2917
04:47:31,979 --> 04:47:43,619
see me, let me see. Let me check here. It's probably going to be, I just have, there's a lot going on.

2918
04:47:43,619 --> 04:47:49,569
I'll be back in a week. I want to stream. I really want to. I don't want to just leave.

2919
04:47:50,209 --> 04:47:57,119
I'm just like not stream for like a week, but probably the 23rd or the 24th. And then after

2920
04:47:57,119 --> 04:48:08,500
that, I can promise you that I will be back. No more seven day breaks. So trust me, I want to,

2921
04:48:08,500 --> 04:48:19,060
I want to be hanging out, but there's a lot of cool stuff that's going to be happening soon.

2922
04:48:19,060 --> 04:48:38,270
Stuff that I'm very excited for. Is there any IRL stuff? Yes, there is. I've got some IRL stuff

2923
04:48:38,270 --> 04:48:45,150
that I need to take care of as well as a ton of stream stuff. Baseball is in kind of crunch time

2924
04:48:45,150 --> 04:48:50,049
right now, but I'm going to have so much fun with that. That's going to be some of the,

2925
04:48:50,049 --> 04:48:56,290
oh, I can't wait. I've been waiting like two years to do that, but everything's good.

2926
04:48:56,290 --> 04:49:06,000
Everything's fine. Don't worry. When I say IRL stuff, it's not, it's everything's fine. Don't

2927
04:49:06,000 --> 04:49:28,720
worry. There's just a ton of things I have to get done. The baseball stream is going to be the first

2928
04:49:28,720 --> 04:49:35,729
first sports event I'm actually going to watch. It's going to be interesting. I will promise you

2929
04:49:35,729 --> 04:49:46,110
that it'll be interesting. Yeah. I'll see you guys in a week. Don't forget about me. I look back. I

2930
04:49:46,110 --> 04:49:56,159
promise. Thanks for watching. Thanks for the subs. Thanks for the raid. There was a couple of raids

2931
04:49:56,159 --> 04:50:07,970
today, right? Or hosts. It's late pretty much anywhere around the world right now. Get some

2932
04:50:07,970 --> 04:50:19,150
sleep. Take care of yourselves. Call your mother, you know, the usual. Have a great night guys.

2933
04:50:23,700 --> 04:50:32,240
See you soon. Oh, and by the way, when I, when I stream again, I'm going to have a ton of dates

2934
04:50:32,959 --> 04:50:36,720
for you guys to mark down. Green screen will have one. Baseball is locked in for the 20th,

2935
04:50:36,720 --> 04:50:42,240
by the way. I want to make sure I make that clear. July 20th. It's not July 14th anymore.

2936
04:50:42,240 --> 04:50:47,680
We had to do a bunch of stuff with the venue. So that's July 20th. It had to move about six

2937
04:50:47,680 --> 04:50:57,650
days later. I might even actually be able to announce the other project, which that would be

2938
04:50:57,650 --> 04:51:06,340
exciting too. I would love to be able to announce the other project. I feel like it's going to be

2939
04:51:06,340 --> 04:52:21,439
a lot of fun, but good night guys. See you soon. Have a good week. I'll be back. Take care. Goodbye.
