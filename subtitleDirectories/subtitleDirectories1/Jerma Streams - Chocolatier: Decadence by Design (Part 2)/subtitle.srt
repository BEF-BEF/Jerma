1
00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:05,860
PlayStation stream? Go to the PlayStation? PlayStation Direct?

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:10,470
No, no, no. No, I'm not- I'm not watchin' another Direct.

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,660
The last one disappointed me. I'm not- What? For me to learn what?

4
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:17,079
What are we gonna learn on this Direct?

5
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:24,600
PlayStation Direct. PlayStation Direct.

6
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:27,429
It actually is called PlayStation Direct.

7
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,200
Play the- PlayStation Direct.

8
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:35,859
No, this is like a shipping company.

9
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,200
Wait, PlayStation Direct.

10
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,840
Limited time only. Free shipping on your entire order with any accessories.

11
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,240
Purchase of $60 or more.

12
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,560
Must meet order threshold of $60.

13
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,020
Some customers may be affected by- Oh, okay.

14
00:00:55,149 --> 00:00:55,649
Watch it.

15
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,750
No, I'm not gonna- I don't wanna watch the PlayStation.

16
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,149
Okay, when did it start? When did it start?

17
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,200
30 minutes ago? Alright. And how long is it gonna go?

18
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,700
You give me updates, okay?

19
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:19,959
When the Ratchet and Clank IRL movie comes out, you just let me know when they announce it.

20
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,650
I'm not watchin' another Direct.

21
00:01:27,349 --> 00:01:28,950
Not unless it's the one I wanna watch.

22
00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:32,950
And no more of those.

23
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,200
It just ended.

24
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:38,099
You haven't missed anything?

25
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,370
It ended when you started. Oh, so you've just fucked with me, okay.

26
00:01:45,969 --> 00:01:47,310
It was a Crash Bandicoot.

27
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:50,099
Yeah.

28
00:01:50,989 --> 00:01:53,989
It's prob- They're gonna keep- They'll keep making Crash Bandicoot.

29
00:01:56,859 --> 00:01:58,459
I never was concerned they wouldn't do it.

30
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,200
Ever since they did the- The Insane Trilogy.

31
00:02:06,489 --> 00:02:07,829
Come on, of course they're gonna do another one.

32
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:11,349
Elden Ring?

33
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,219
No, there was the- Hold on. Was there an Elden Ring thing?

34
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,699
What has it been on the PlayStation one?

35
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,310
Elden Ring leaks posted by impatient fans.

36
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,080
Ha ha ha. Are fake, okay.

37
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,860
Elden Ring Insider shares update.

38
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:35,159
Okay.

39
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,280
That's- That's not real.

40
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:43,650
Whatever.

41
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,979
You tell me what happens.

42
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:52,729
You know, sitting there for 60 minutes with my fingers in my mouth just biting my fingernails, are they gonna announce?

43
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:55,930
Are they gonna announce Super Street Fighter VII?

44
00:02:56,729 --> 00:02:58,030
No, I can read it in a tweet.

45
00:02:58,930 --> 00:02:59,430
Five minutes.

46
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:00,629
After the thing's over.

47
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,900
I'd rather relax.

48
00:03:03,699 --> 00:03:06,199
And just like, make chocolates and then- Oh, wait a minute.

49
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,500
Elden Ring has an announcement?

50
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:09,800
Date?

51
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,699
Oh, okay. I can be in the bathtub and read that.

52
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,460
That's too much. Too much stress.

53
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:22,610
I'd lived through that. I did that shit. I'd lived through that and I don't want to live through that again.

54
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:26,599
I remember Super Smash Bros. Brawl.

55
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,300
Sakurai would do weekly Friday updates.

56
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:34,789
Announcing a new character or a new thing that was in the game.

57
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:36,389
And that was what you did.

58
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,189
It was at three o'clock in the morning.

59
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,389
And it was all I cared about.

60
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:41,990
Oh my god, is this the day?

61
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:44,990
Are they gonna- Is- Oh my god, is Donkey Kong in this one?

62
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:48,389
It consumed like four months of my life.

63
00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:50,360
And then I played-

64
00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:52,860
I played Brawl for probably a total of-

65
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:55,259
Oh, no, no, no. That's the one I played a lot of.

66
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:56,659
Yeah, that was worth it.

67
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,599
It's so funny because Brawl is the one that I put all the time into and it's the one that everybody says is the worst one.

68
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,469
Right? By a lot.

69
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,069
I thought it was fun.

70
00:04:13,669 --> 00:04:16,670
But I know that most people say that that's the absolute worst one.

71
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:19,439
It's the one I actually played.

72
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,269
Meta Knight was in the game.

73
00:04:23,269 --> 00:04:24,769
Oh, yeah. I remember people playing Meta Knight.

74
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:28,870
They just turned into the drill and just flew around and just won every single match.

75
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:30,269
I remember that.

76
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:35,399
Brawl was the best casual one.

77
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:36,199
Yeah, I mean, it was fun.

78
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,399
I- That's the one I put all the time into.

79
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:48,639
Why don't you stream the awful PlayStation Direct?

80
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,740
I'm not- No, we're not doing that.

81
00:04:53,449 --> 00:04:55,149
We are gonna- I'm gonna just change the camera because-

82
00:04:55,149 --> 00:04:57,050
Wait, I didn't even tweet this. I'm not even here. I'll be right back.

83
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,310
This shit ended an hour ago.

84
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:21,220
You liars. This ended like a full hour ago.

85
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:25,990
I'm sitting here being like, eh, maybe I should stream this. Eh, maybe it's almost-

86
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,389
Maybe there'll be an announcement at the end.

87
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:29,790
There's nothing on here. It was- This was like over.

88
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,730
It ended seven minutes ago.

89
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:35,930
Well, then look. Then, good, it was fu- It was good I didn't stream it.

90
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:40,170
Because guess what? I don't see anybody talking about anything in this Direct.

91
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:45,290
I've seen like two things that people thought was cool.

92
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,620
I would've- It would've been spammed if something huge was announced.

93
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,800
So, what? Whatever.

94
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,600
Alright, I'm ready. I didn't- I didn't- I didn't even tweet anything. I'll be right back.

95
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:18,420
Do I not know how to spell chocolate so badly that my iPhone thought I was trying to say cholesterol?

96
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:25,610
How do you spell- It's choc- col- choc-o-late, right?

97
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,370
Choc-o-late.

98
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,420
Factory.

99
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:32,709
Entrepreneur.

100
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,160
Holy shit.

101
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:38,959
Chocolate. Fav-tory.

102
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,360
Entree-an-or-near.

103
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,160
I can't type. I hate these fucking things.

104
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:45,459
I hate phones.

105
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:47,560
I hate them. I don't want them anymore.

106
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,860
I don't want to use this phone anymore.

107
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,759
Fucking try- Get me by goddamn-

108
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:53,699
Send to Telegram.

109
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,939
I'm gonna give you guys a stream notification by Telegram.

110
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:10,209
Alright, hold on. I'm almost ready.

111
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:13,790
PlayStation Direct.

112
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,800
You- I- I can't- Dude, what would- What- Okay.

113
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,399
What do you think would happen if Super Mario was announced for PlayStation?

114
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,279
What would happen?

115
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:30,079
I think Twitter would go down.

116
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:36,370
Like, if it was like, Super Mario!

117
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:38,690
It's 8! Or something.

118
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:42,190
Like, Super Mario Galaxy 3 was on PlayStation 5.

119
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:44,940
What do you think would happen?

120
00:08:47,659 --> 00:08:49,159
Talk to the factory entrepreneur. Alright, there we go.

121
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,490
Alright, we're gonna pick up where we left off yesterday.

122
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,789
I really like this game. I think it's fun.

123
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,799
That would make no sense.

124
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:02,559
I know, that would make no fucking sense.

125
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,500
It would make absolutely no sense.

126
00:09:07,669 --> 00:09:09,070
That's like a dream that you have.

127
00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:13,570
Right? What I just said was so stupid and just so, like, I'm just stalling to make a tweet.

128
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,500
That- You have a dream where that happens.

129
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:23,860
And it's a dream that you forget when you wake up.

130
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,059
It's so asinine.

131
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,159
And just so- Just-

132
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,000
Not important at all.

133
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,600
That's the ones you forget.

134
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:33,100
What the fuck was that dream? I don't know.

135
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,700
Something about, like, a game? I don't know.

136
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,299
I forget it. It was so fucking inconsequential to me.

137
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,070
Alright, let's go.

138
00:09:44,179 --> 00:09:45,379
Is camera not on right?

139
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,820
I'm always so paranoid about this shit. I swear to God.

140
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,120
Oh, wait, hold on.

141
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:56,830
Did it go into full screen, man?

142
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,149
Ooh, I remember this music.

143
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,600
What the fuck? Naked.

144
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:08,299
Yeah.

145
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,700
You wish.

146
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:14,429
Alright, so, where we left off, if you missed the last stream.

147
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:17,159
Wait, this is Chocolatier.

148
00:10:18,769 --> 00:10:20,269
I forget- I don't know what this is a hashtag.

149
00:10:20,669 --> 00:10:22,070
Not a hashtag, it's a colon.

150
00:10:22,669 --> 00:10:24,370
It's called the- It's just Chocolatier.

151
00:10:25,169 --> 00:10:26,169
You make chocolates.

152
00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:29,669
You have to fly around the world, buy ingredients, make money.

153
00:10:29,669 --> 00:10:32,070
If you weren't here yesterday, you missed a lot of money.

154
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:37,159
The last thing I was doing- We have a quest log here.

155
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:38,960
Right, okay. I remember.

156
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:41,629
It was gambling? Yes, there is.

157
00:10:41,629 --> 00:10:42,929
But I'm not gonna go do that right now.

158
00:10:42,929 --> 00:10:45,830
I'm gonna just chill and play- I gotta do my quests.

159
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:53,960
That was disgusting. I'm sad that that got picked up by the microphone.

160
00:10:56,809 --> 00:10:58,710
Alright, so, I got coffee here.

161
00:10:59,629 --> 00:11:01,330
This is my Cuban clock cleaner.

162
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,799
It's got cayenne pepper, Cuban coffee, and honey.

163
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,259
If I'm not mistaken.

164
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,659
This is a huge seller.

165
00:11:12,789 --> 00:11:14,590
And then I'm making the special reserve.

166
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,990
Right, I'm making it for a reason though.

167
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:20,259
I have 40 cases of Arabian Bolden Inventory.

168
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:22,759
I'm gonna go back to this fine coffee maker here.

169
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,149
I have two cases- Oh wait, this guy.

170
00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:26,149
The guy that gave us the tip.

171
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,149
I forgot about this guy.

172
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,519
He doesn't want very much.

173
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,720
Okay, we'd have to give him two cases of raspberry.

174
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:35,600
24 cases of Cafe Con Leche.

175
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:40,980
Alright, 34 cases of special 66% African cacao reserves.

176
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:42,500
Which I should have.

177
00:11:43,299 --> 00:11:43,899
Talk to-

178
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,299
Oh wait, we have to go back to this person?

179
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:59,830
This guy wants to bring two cases of raspberry.

180
00:12:00,129 --> 00:12:01,230
And he gave us a recipe.

181
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:04,929
But he also wants 34 cases of the special reserve for a recipe.

182
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,519
So I gotta make the raspberry ones too.

183
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,919
I can't go back empty-handed here.

184
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:13,220
Alright, let's go back to the chocolate factory.

185
00:12:20,129 --> 00:12:21,029
Leche means milk.

186
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,299
Why is that confusing you?

187
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,139
Look, it's been a day.

188
00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:29,889
The chocolate ark.

189
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:30,389
That's right.

190
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:31,490
Alright, so what do we got?

191
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:35,570
I have 30- Okay, I need 34 of the special reserve.

192
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:37,169
I have 34 Cuban clock cleaners.

193
00:12:37,169 --> 00:12:38,769
This is gonna be a fucking huge sale.

194
00:12:39,169 --> 00:12:41,070
Oh, that's not good.

195
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,269
No, no, I'm not selling it here.

196
00:12:42,809 --> 00:12:44,509
Get out of here with these low prices.

197
00:12:48,509 --> 00:12:49,309
What else do I need to make?

198
00:12:49,909 --> 00:12:51,009
I need to continue making this.

199
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:53,279
Almost out of peppers.

200
00:12:54,269 --> 00:12:55,769
We- I gotta change what coffee I'm making.

201
00:12:55,769 --> 00:12:59,279
But first of all, I'm gonna make-

202
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:01,080
I'm just gonna make this right now.

203
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,460
And I'm gonna change it to raspberry.

204
00:13:04,309 --> 00:13:05,210
Because we need a bunch of these.

205
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:05,610
Make it.

206
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:06,110
Here we go.

207
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:08,379
Let's see how rusty I am.

208
00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:12,509
Poison in the coffee.

209
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,250
Well, you're a psycho.

210
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,059
Hey dude, I got a wicked good idea of how you can really grow your business.

211
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,759
Put poison in the coffee.

212
00:13:24,789 --> 00:13:26,590
I think your business would not last very long.

213
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:31,889
You'd be out of business very shortly.

214
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,240
Put poison in the coffee.

215
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,370
You spend all the time.

216
00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:53,070
All the money, all the resources to get the factories, get the permits.

217
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:57,450
And the first thing you want to do, the factory's ready to go.

218
00:13:58,149 --> 00:13:58,950
You got the chocolate.

219
00:13:58,950 --> 00:13:59,850
You've got the recipes.

220
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,649
It was passed out by your fucking grandmother.

221
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,309
Spray Windex and all that.

222
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,500
What the fuck, dude?

223
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,399
No, what are you doing?

224
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,200
What's wrong with you?

225
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,399
What the fuck, dude?

226
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,700
Fuck you.

227
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,440
All right, well, that's the end of that day.

228
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,100
Like, oh, we got our chocolate spinning in that big vat

229
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,399
that you see on every single one of those How It's Made videos.

230
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,700
With the churning.

231
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,600
It's a big bowl.

232
00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:29,940
That's sideways.

233
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:30,639
That's spinning.

234
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:34,419
And some guy comes over the ladle and he drops like flavorings in it.

235
00:14:34,419 --> 00:14:36,419
It spins around.

236
00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:40,190
And then the CEO comes over with Windex and goes.

237
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:46,799
Fuck you.

238
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:47,600
Get out of here.

239
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:49,100
I'm doing shit here.

240
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:55,990
We just opened the factory.

241
00:14:56,389 --> 00:14:57,889
Get the fuck out of here.

242
00:14:58,529 --> 00:14:59,330
Go home.

243
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,500
He throws cigarettes in.

244
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:03,700
He just has a lit cigarette.

245
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,539
That chocolate looks really good.

246
00:15:10,539 --> 00:15:13,740
Imagine being the chocolatier and being like, you fucking asshole.

247
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,340
Now we got to shut the whole thing down.

248
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:19,240
God.

249
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:21,259
Well, I'm not that guy.

250
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,090
He's actually mad.

251
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,190
I am mad at this guy.

252
00:15:24,289 --> 00:15:25,889
This guy, that was stupid what he did.

253
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:26,990
He shouldn't have done that.

254
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:31,559
He sprayed Windex into my chocolate spinning undulator

255
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:32,960
and it's making me very mad.

256
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,860
This person doesn't exist, but I hate them.

257
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:35,960
I hate this person.

258
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,179
Oh, we're out of coffee.

259
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:39,480
Okay.

260
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,330
You mad at a made-up person.

261
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:45,330
So what?

262
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,049
Could be real.

263
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:52,049
Okay.

264
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,450
Now, okay, we need to change this.

265
00:15:53,549 --> 00:15:55,850
We need more of the special reserve chocolate.

266
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,049
I love this game.

267
00:15:57,049 --> 00:15:58,250
This game is so cool.

268
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:00,759
All right.

269
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,259
I need to do a change recipe.

270
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:05,120
I need a raspberry.

271
00:16:06,019 --> 00:16:06,919
Ooh, look at that.

272
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:09,929
How many cases do I need?

273
00:16:10,789 --> 00:16:11,690
Just two, right?

274
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:13,690
But we could probably sell this for pretty good.

275
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:16,350
All right.

276
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:16,850
Let's go for it.

277
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,230
Beef in the chocolate.

278
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:28,970
I mean, I don't know how the in-depth the game gets later,

279
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,389
but I know for a fact that

280
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:36,330
we have at least four of the pages that we have not made chocolates on.

281
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:38,730
That's a full stack.

282
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:39,830
That's a full stack.

283
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:40,830
I'm really happy about that one.

284
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:41,730
Really happy about that turned out.

285
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,070
I wish that I wish that I didn't want games like this.

286
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:49,039
I don't care about any other video game.

287
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,740
You guys wanted me to watch the fucking PlayStation Direct.

288
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:52,940
I care about this.

289
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,039
I want I'm gonna play this.

290
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:00,019
Like PlayStation could have come up with a press release that said

291
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,120
if you watched the direct you got $50 deposited into your bank account

292
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,519
and I would be like I'd rather play the chocolate game.

293
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:04,920
I don't care.

294
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:06,940
Be like, no, I don't care.

295
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:13,359
I'm busy.

296
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,759
I'm very busy.

297
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,480
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

298
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,170
Rich Stravers.

299
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,430
No, I'm am I the am I the weird CEO?

300
00:17:41,099 --> 00:17:45,000
No, I don't want to be the weird CEO guy that like just I'm playing my

301
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,700
chocolate game.

302
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,299
Leave me alone.

303
00:17:47,779 --> 00:17:48,880
Get the fuck away from me.

304
00:17:54,259 --> 00:17:55,759
You're a millennial CEO.

305
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:01,500
I've got I've got like a fucking Star Wars t-shirt on.

306
00:18:02,099 --> 00:18:07,960
I'm wearing slippers and like jogging pants and I like skipped out on

307
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,160
my company meeting because I'm playing an old nostalgic chocolate

308
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,259
making game.

309
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:18,720
Oh, no guys.

310
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,819
This shit like kind of happened.

311
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:26,460
I've got like important stuff going on.

312
00:18:26,859 --> 00:18:29,960
We got I got a huge fucking stream coming up and I skipped out on

313
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,660
a fucking meeting.

314
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,559
It didn't happen today, but it may have happened.

315
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:35,559
I lay yesterday.

316
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:41,730
It's real.

317
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:45,569
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't worry.

318
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:46,440
It's okay.

319
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:51,640
I'll bring myself down a few pegs when I do the Catboy stream, right?

320
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Down a few pegs.

321
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,900
It's a term.

322
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:02,400
It's cleaning your clock.

323
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,400
It's down a few pegs.

324
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,700
It's getting knocked down a few.

325
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:08,059
You have no idea what my plan is for that stream.

326
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:10,960
I'm going to tell you one of the plans and I can't do it and I

327
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,059
it's a hold on.

328
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,359
I have to ask if I can do no.

329
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:14,559
All right.

330
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,859
You know, I'm going to tell you one of the things I was going to

331
00:19:15,859 --> 00:19:18,059
do you don't think I'll be knocked down a few pegs.

332
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:22,160
I wanted to have should I tell you should I tell you should I keep

333
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,859
it a secret for the Catboy stream?

334
00:19:23,859 --> 00:19:25,259
That's something that'll knock me down a few pegs.

335
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,019
Hmm.

336
00:19:27,589 --> 00:19:28,990
Maybe I'll tell you now.

337
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:31,289
No, I can't tell you because if I can do it, it's worth it.

338
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,099
Secret.

339
00:19:33,099 --> 00:19:33,299
All right.

340
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:33,700
It's fine.

341
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,299
It's fine.

342
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:34,599
Fine.

343
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,200
Fine.

344
00:19:40,099 --> 00:19:40,299
All right.

345
00:19:40,299 --> 00:19:40,700
How about this?

346
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:45,759
If I can't do it, I'll tell you if I cannot do the thing I want

347
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:50,609
to do on the Catboy stream after the Catboy stream, I will tell

348
00:19:50,609 --> 00:19:54,180
you what it was and then you can decide if it was a bad or

349
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,079
a good idea or not.

350
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:55,579
Okay.

351
00:19:59,529 --> 00:19:59,829
Deal.

352
00:19:59,829 --> 00:20:00,130
All right.

353
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:00,329
Cool.

354
00:20:00,329 --> 00:20:00,630
Cool.

355
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:01,700
All right.

356
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,500
So I have enough.

357
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:04,460
All right.

358
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,759
So let's go deliver this to this the guy he wants the raspberry.

359
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:08,160

360
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,059
He wants to raspberry.

361
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:10,259
So I'm going to who likes row.

362
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:17,339
Ooh, it's 17 sell 15 of these raspberry cases.

363
00:20:17,339 --> 00:20:20,140
That's 8,800 bucks clean right there.

364
00:20:21,349 --> 00:20:22,250
Bring those two to him.

365
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:26,380
He needs I can get what way more for this coffee.

366
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:30,150
I changed the coffee to any cayenne peppers, but I'm flooding

367
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,450
the market with Cuban clock cleaners.

368
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,140
Remember, it's two Catboy streams.

369
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:35,950
Yeah.

370
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:42,680
Well, the first Catboy stream is going to be a little wild.

371
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,880
The second Catboy stream of us.

372
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:44,680
I don't know.

373
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,680
I'm not going to say it.

374
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:49,430
Just wait.

375
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:50,329
Just wait.

376
00:20:50,329 --> 00:20:50,829
Maybe.

377
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,130
Maybe you're like a year.

378
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:52,630
I'm just kidding.

379
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:53,630
It'll happen in like a few months.

380
00:20:54,329 --> 00:20:54,730
I'm just kidding.

381
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,529
It'll happen in probably like three months, four months.

382
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,059
All right, let's go.

383
00:20:59,019 --> 00:21:00,819
I need to travel to where was this guy?

384
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:08,480
Okay in years.

385
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,000
It's not tomorrow.

386
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,299
No.

387
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:15,250
All right.

388
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:15,650
Here we go.

389
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:18,920
Hey Steve.

390
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,220
So that was the two raspberry.

391
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,670
Oh, so we got this guy's a contact now and then 34 cases of the reserve.

392
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:26,170
There it is.

393
00:21:26,779 --> 00:21:29,079
I trust Felix had something to do with this in which case it's

394
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:32,480
my pleasure to give you a new coffee recipe special blend.

395
00:21:33,339 --> 00:21:35,940
And of course you can find the Moroccan coffee for this recipe

396
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,339
at the market here in Tangier's.

397
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,039
Stop by in a month or so.

398
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,640
I hear all kinds of things down at the port.

399
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:45,170
Ooh, special blend.

400
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:49,630
I got I have a lot of this.

401
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,700
Should I make some special blend coffee?

402
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,000
No.

403
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:53,480
No, what was that?

404
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,380
That was a weird voice.

405
00:21:55,369 --> 00:21:56,670
I had a fucking dream about SpongeBob.

406
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:57,069
What was it?

407
00:21:58,930 --> 00:21:59,230
Oh my God.

408
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,329
What was the dream about SpongeBob?

409
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:04,789
I had one of those stupid inconsequential dreams and

410
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:06,990
remember we talked about how Super Mario was on PlayStation 5

411
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:09,289
and that's like a dumb dream that like who cares and you wake

412
00:22:09,289 --> 00:22:10,289
up and you don't even give a shit anymore.

413
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:11,089
You forget it in an hour.

414
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:14,990
I had a SpongeBob on TV did something dream.

415
00:22:15,289 --> 00:22:17,490
That was so dumb and inconsequential and meant nothing.

416
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:18,390
But what was it?

417
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,339
Oh my God.

418
00:22:23,339 --> 00:22:24,039
What was it?

419
00:22:24,339 --> 00:22:25,940
It was so inconsequential.

420
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:26,740
It was stupid.

421
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:29,599
Okay.

422
00:22:31,539 --> 00:22:35,740
I think the reason why I said the imagine if Mario was on

423
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:39,839
PlayStation thing was because I think the only thing that was

424
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:43,539
weird about the dream was SpongeBob was on TBS or something.

425
00:22:44,569 --> 00:22:45,170
That was it.

426
00:22:45,769 --> 00:22:47,470
It was like, oh why SpongeBob's on TBS?

427
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:48,670
That's he's not on this network.

428
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:50,069
I think that's why I said that today.

429
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,660
Is that really what happened?

430
00:22:54,859 --> 00:22:56,960
Am I just retroactively adding that memory in?

431
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,460
I don't know.

432
00:22:58,259 --> 00:22:59,359
I think that's what happened though.

433
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:03,960
Okay.

434
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,529
Let's all right.

435
00:23:05,529 --> 00:23:06,829
I need to sell fine.

436
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:09,329
I trusted you with a recipe silly zonka wonka.

437
00:23:10,369 --> 00:23:12,970
I also trusted the next time you darken my doorway.

438
00:23:13,069 --> 00:23:15,069
You'll have 40 cases of Arabian bold.

439
00:23:15,069 --> 00:23:15,869
We agreed upon.

440
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,440
That's not a bad price considering I flooded the market with this stuff.

441
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:35,390
No, no, no, I'm not going to sell it here.

442
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:37,089
Let me say play the game.

443
00:23:37,089 --> 00:23:37,890
This is playing the game.

444
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:39,589
It's fucking talking and making deals.

445
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,890
That's the what is we talking about play the game.

446
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:54,220
I'm talking and making deals with people Jesus.

447
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,019
That's so expensive.

448
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:56,519
All right.

449
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:57,220
I'm going to go.

450
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:00,920
I'm going to go sell this.

451
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,259
You have peppers.

452
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:03,859
No.

453
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:04,160
Okay.

454
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,059
I need to get peppers.

455
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:10,970
Let's see if we can sell this Cuban clock cleaner for like 150 grand.

456
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:14,670
I can.

457
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:14,970
All right.

458
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:16,069
I can get about this is cheap.

459
00:24:19,819 --> 00:24:20,220
Fuck.

460
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,259
I had an opportunity to get rid of all this.

461
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:26,609
That's not a bad price for this though.

462
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:27,910
Yeah, I'll sell it.

463
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:32,519
Not a bad price for the raspberry either.

464
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,140
I'm gonna sell it.

465
00:24:38,339 --> 00:24:42,140
I want someone to previous to seem for 15 to 45.

466
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:45,740
I could have sold it for 2238 in Tangier's fuck.

467
00:24:49,819 --> 00:24:51,720
Did I hear that you might be able to move a bit on your offer?

468
00:24:52,619 --> 00:24:53,819
But that's still not enough.

469
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:57,089
Is that the best price?

470
00:24:57,089 --> 00:24:58,990
I'm going to get for this until I have to change coffees.

471
00:25:00,569 --> 00:25:05,910
We're like, this is the among us guy.

472
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:12,109
No, you keep people keep confusing me for that person.

473
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,660
People confuse me for that person all the time.

474
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,140
I don't know who that person is.

475
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:26,910
You're a liar.

476
00:25:29,259 --> 00:25:31,660
They used germa sus at the Sony conference.

477
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,960
What the fuck are you talking about?

478
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,559
No, they didn't.

479
00:25:34,819 --> 00:25:35,119
Hold on.

480
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:35,920
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

481
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:40,519
Fuck.

482
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:41,519
I just exit of the game.

483
00:25:42,869 --> 00:25:43,170
I did.

484
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:43,470
I'm good.

485
00:25:45,549 --> 00:25:46,049

486
00:25:47,109 --> 00:25:47,509
Show me.

487
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:48,109

00:25:49,779 --> 00:25:50,180
They did.

489
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:50,779
No, they didn't.

490
00:25:50,779 --> 00:25:51,480
I don't believe you.

491
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,599
Which master grill xbbq has been banned or whatever.

492
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:06,480
Good stream of it.

493
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,779
But why are you linking me this?

494
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:11,930
Why are you linking me this?

495
00:26:14,549 --> 00:26:15,450
Give me the real one.

496
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,650
Give me the why are you linking me this shit?

497
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:20,059
Okay.

498
00:26:20,259 --> 00:26:22,960
So for like the people that have told me please play the game

You got to blame the people like the 5,000 people that sent

We do talk about wasting time.

505
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:45,019
This is like the ultimate time waster.

506
00:26:48,009 --> 00:26:48,509
It's all right.

507
00:26:48,509 --> 00:26:49,509

I've had that command since like 2015.

524

That's a command from it's a spell in the game sorcery way

please going on with you guys today.

535
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,369
Hmm full moon.

536
00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:10,940
Is there a full moon check?

537
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:13,930
I'm gonna check and see if there's a full moon tonight.

538
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:27,309
Is it I bet it is I bet it is okay, so I can I don't know

539
00:28:27,309 --> 00:28:28,910
if I want to sell this for 1887.

540
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,299
I can get a better price somewhere else.

541
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Although I should buy some more peppers.

542
00:28:36,309 --> 00:28:37,910
Are you is this price final here?

543
00:28:39,089 --> 00:28:40,490
Is there a little bit of wiggle room here?

544
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:41,390
Thank you.

545
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:42,890
What that really is a little bit.

546
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:44,089
That was like a dollar off.

547
00:28:47,099 --> 00:28:51,480
That was three dollars off the full moon tomorrow.

548
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,079
Yeah, I know.

549
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:52,779
Trust me.

550
00:28:52,779 --> 00:28:53,180
I know.

551
00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:01,190
Well, whatever I need enough to get rid of the honey.

552
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:03,079
I'm going big.

553
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:07,390
I'm gonna sell a shitload of these.

554
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:07,589
All right.

555
00:29:07,589 --> 00:29:09,789
You might think that but it was a bad idea, but I needed the

556
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:14,569
peppers almonds are pretty cheap here.

557
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:20,750
Ooh, that's cheap friends.

558
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:21,549
These are really cheap.

559
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,740
Yeah, I'm gonna get a bunch of these two.

560
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,339
Let's get a hundred of these.

561
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:30,940
I got tons of sugar already.

562
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:37,710
All right, that should continue to produce by the way, if

563
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,609
you don't know why I did that if this is me that weren't

564
00:29:39,609 --> 00:29:44,380
here yesterday every time I travel or make a new batch

565
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:47,279
of chocolate a week goes by so this is not producing

566
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:48,079
chocolate right now.

567
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:51,380
It only starts to produce when I cycle through time.

568
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:52,549
We have not done that yet.

569
00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:55,450
It's every every time I do a task.

570
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:56,549
No one cares.

571
00:29:58,150 --> 00:29:58,950
Oh, okay.

572
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:03,049
No, no one cares says Jerma zerked on stream.

573
00:30:11,299 --> 00:30:15,000
Jerma zerked on stream says hey nobody cares.

574
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,660
Should we mod them for an hour?

575
00:30:26,089 --> 00:30:27,690
No, I can't see back.

576
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:32,180
All right back like back like years ago like all mod

577
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:32,880
that guy ha ha.

578
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,180
Oh, yeah.

579
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:36,180
I modded that guy for like 45 minutes or something.

580
00:30:36,849 --> 00:30:39,150
There are whole systems in place now across like the

581
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:40,549
discord and the channel.

582
00:30:40,849 --> 00:30:44,160
We're modding somebody for like 30 minutes might pose

583
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,559
complete disaster to detonate the entire community.

584
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:50,089
They could just they could cause mayhem if they really

585
00:30:50,089 --> 00:30:51,890
wanted to so like I can't do that anymore.

586
00:30:56,509 --> 00:31:00,619
It's a funny thought though, isn't it true?

587
00:31:00,619 --> 00:31:01,319
So do it.

588
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:05,019
No VIP them.

589
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,519
There are whole systems in place.

590
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:06,720
Now.

591
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,220
All right play the fucking game 13% of people that watch

592
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,319
the stream on the census want you to play the video

593
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:12,519
game.

594
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:13,720
I have to make them happy.

595
00:31:16,819 --> 00:31:17,119
Holy shit.

596
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:17,920
I gotta take a picture of this.

597
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:19,619
What the fuck is going on?

598
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:21,319
Quick quick quick quick quick quick quick quick.

599
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:23,019
This battery just is standing on end.

600
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:24,019
This is like a magic thing.

601
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:25,119
I have no idea what's going on.

602
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:26,220
I don't know how this is happening how this is how

603
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:26,720
this is happening.

604
00:31:27,549 --> 00:31:28,349
I gotta get a picture of this.

605
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:31,000
Oh my fucking God.

606
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,329
What is doing this floating?

607
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:35,730
I have a floating battery in front of me.

608
00:31:37,609 --> 00:31:49,880
Why why holy shit?

609
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,880
Why is that happening?

610
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:52,460
Okay.

611
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:52,759
Okay.

612
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:55,710
I have to let me get I have to shut I'm gonna put

613
00:31:55,710 --> 00:32:00,059
this on the discord or just I'm gonna put it on

614
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:05,230
here the cam on no no no I can't I'm naked.

615
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:09,720
Why did this happen?

616
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,640
You guys have to see this.

617
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,339
I gotta get this.

618
00:32:16,339 --> 00:32:16,740
I'll tweet.

619
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,640
I'm gonna tweet this out.

620
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:21,930
Here comes a tweet.

621
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:35,279
I'm just gonna I don't understand why this happened.

622
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:49,920
You tell me what's going on here.

623
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:52,819
This is probably so easily explainable, but I can't

624
00:32:52,819 --> 00:32:53,220
explain it.

625
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,819
So I'm gonna delete this tweet in like an hour.

626
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,279
Okay, here it goes.

627
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:11,710
Tell me what's going on here.

628
00:33:18,869 --> 00:33:19,470
Did it go through?

629
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,319
Why did that happen?

630
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:29,269
Why is this floating?

631
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:37,680
It's a magnet.

632
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:39,720
This is not a magnet.

633
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,019
That's a base of my that's the base of my monitors.

634
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:43,019
That's a monitor stand.

635
00:33:44,069 --> 00:33:44,769
It's dusty.

636
00:33:45,369 --> 00:33:45,869
Come on.

637
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,190
But what do you mean magnet?

638
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:50,190
This is this is the bottom of my monitor stand.

639
00:33:52,359 --> 00:34:00,000
This is not there's not a magnet right here static

640
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,400
electricity.

641
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,400
Why is the battery stuck?

642
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:01,700
I don't know.

643
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,599
It's stuck hard.

644
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,200
There's a magnet in the battery.

645
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:09,309
You can't see the magnets in the monitor.

646
00:34:09,309 --> 00:34:12,420
What your monitor has magnetic properties.

647
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:14,690
I'm gonna put it on stream.

648
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:17,579
You guys see it.

649
00:34:17,579 --> 00:34:18,179
It's all magnets.

650
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:19,480
This literally has to be a magnet in there.

651
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,679
Why would there be a magnet on the bottom of my

652
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:21,179
monitor?

653
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,599
What the fuck would the point be having a monitor

654
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:28,800
stand with a magnet in the bottom?

655
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:30,630
Why would you tweet this?

656
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,030
I don't know.

657
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:31,730
I'm deleting it.

658
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:44,940
Batteries are magnetic.

659
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:47,579
Yeah, but I have like a plastic stand.

660
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:54,590
I think that's magic.

661
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:06,190
Okay, that's this.

662
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:08,889
That's the image you send like to your mom being

663
00:35:08,889 --> 00:35:09,489
like mom.

664
00:35:09,489 --> 00:35:10,989
What the heck is going on?

665
00:35:10,989 --> 00:35:12,989
And she's like, oh honey, that's really really

666
00:35:12,989 --> 00:35:13,590
interesting.

667
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:17,130
No, there are magnets battery is magnetized

668
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:19,829
and it's sticking to the metal base of your

669
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:22,630
monitor really neat though, really really cool

670
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:23,530
that it happened that way.

671
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:24,530
I didn't put it there.

672
00:35:26,349 --> 00:35:28,559
I'm telling you I just like I took a sip of my

673
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:30,860
coffee and I heard and I looked over in this

674
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:34,199
fucking Duracell just sticking out of my monitor.

675
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:36,960
That was weird.

676
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,460
It's neat.

677
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:40,170
Okay, neat things.

678
00:35:40,269 --> 00:35:41,570
All right, clean your desk.

679
00:35:42,619 --> 00:35:43,219
It's dusty.

680
00:35:43,219 --> 00:35:44,219
I live in Las Vegas.

681
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,099
It's dry and dusty here.

682
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:55,579
Dust it.

683
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,239
No, I did.

684
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:58,340
I do and none of that.

685
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:01,079
That's oh no, I see what you guys are saying.

686
00:36:02,309 --> 00:36:05,280
That's just like a weird finish on the bottom

687
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,679
of my monitor.

688
00:36:09,949 --> 00:36:11,550
I see what you guys are saying that like the

689
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:13,349
dust on the thing is not actually dust.

690
00:36:13,349 --> 00:36:15,909
It's like a it's like just speckled for some

691
00:36:15,909 --> 00:36:16,210
reason.

692
00:36:18,699 --> 00:36:23,429
That was your fucking desk look like okay right

693
00:36:23,429 --> 00:36:28,250
now at least 5000 of you just crumpled up the

694
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:31,150
fucking like McDonald's french fry container

695
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,949
you have on there just sitting there with like

696
00:36:32,949 --> 00:36:36,150
three just dead gross fries at the bottom that

697
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:38,349
you didn't eat and you just like I threw that

698
00:36:38,349 --> 00:36:38,550
away.

699
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,449
That's not on my desk.

700
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:45,590
Sure, but I have a little bit of dust on my desk.

701
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:47,489
I am not allowed to sneeze.

702
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:48,389
I'm sorry.

703
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:49,389
Okay, let's go.

704
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:52,329
You're projecting.

705
00:36:52,429 --> 00:36:54,730
No, I it's called I am leveling with you.

706
00:36:58,539 --> 00:37:02,599
We're not American but only Americans eat

707
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:03,300
McDonald's.

708
00:37:04,869 --> 00:37:08,750
This person is lost by the way, they just keep

709
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:09,750
driving around in a circle.

710
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,650
I feel like I want to come to stop this person.

711
00:37:15,539 --> 00:37:16,739
How much cocaine do you do?

712
00:37:16,739 --> 00:37:17,340
Zero.

713
00:37:17,949 --> 00:37:22,599
I have no drugs in my system and I never have I

714
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:24,500
am naturally fucking out of my mind.

715
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:32,539
Okay, it's natural.

716
00:37:32,739 --> 00:37:33,539
What about red wine?

717
00:37:33,539 --> 00:37:34,440
No, I just today.

718
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:34,739
I don't know.

719
00:37:34,739 --> 00:37:37,139
I'm just like I'm like I'm uppity today.

720
00:37:37,139 --> 00:37:38,539
You know, I'm very up up here.

721
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,599
I don't know why let's go.

722
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:41,500
What happened today?

723
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:45,539
Cheap you're kidding.

724
00:37:45,539 --> 00:37:46,440
These are laughable.

725
00:37:53,699 --> 00:37:54,800
This coffee sells really well.

726
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,500
Let's get 200.

727
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,300
You're absolutely on something illegal.

728
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:09,320
I wonder how can you know, it's really funny.

729
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:11,650
I've had conversations with people in the past

730
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:13,550
and like, okay, let's be let's just truly just

731
00:38:14,219 --> 00:38:15,619
take a second here and just talk about this.

732
00:38:16,019 --> 00:38:17,920
I've had people in the past actually tell me.

733
00:38:19,099 --> 00:38:21,300
Yeah, dude, like I thought like maybe at some

734
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,500
point maybe you were on drugs at some point.

735
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,920
I'm just like really you actually fucking thought

736
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,400
that like yeah, I like figured maybe you could

737
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,000
have been I'm like no.

738
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,500
I've not at all like get out of here.

739
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,079
I've had that asked before like dude.

740
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,179
Like be honest though.

741
00:38:40,179 --> 00:38:42,880
Like you like you've dabbled a little while on

742
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,380
stream.

743
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,079
No, absolutely not at zero.

744
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:46,480
Never in my life in my whole life.

745
00:38:49,349 --> 00:38:50,349
Like that's okay.

746
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:53,570
And it's almost like more bizarre to them.

747
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:54,369
But that's the case.

748
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,699
Like wait.

749
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,199
All right, man.

750
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,699
No, but you have though, right?

751
00:38:59,699 --> 00:39:01,500
Like I you can tell me we're like clothes.

752
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:10,349
No, he's just fucked up.

753
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:11,250
I'm not even fucked up.

754
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:18,750
I'm just like I'm just uppity today ADHD prior.

755
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:19,250
That's what it is.

756
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:26,469
Yeah, that's yeah, of course uppity equals high.

757
00:39:26,869 --> 00:39:27,170
All right.

758
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:27,969
Let's play the game.

759
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:33,670
That's a bad excuse.

760
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:34,969
I'm not even making an excuse.

761
00:39:34,969 --> 00:39:36,070
I'm just having fun, man.

762
00:39:36,929 --> 00:39:38,230
Okay, so I have enough coffee.

763
00:39:39,789 --> 00:39:42,579
Let's go to Australia because I know there's

764
00:39:42,579 --> 00:39:43,280
no this note.

765
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:48,599
I have a feeling that I can go to Kona and sell

766
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:50,400
this incredible coffee.

767
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,440
It's a big trip.

768
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,139
I'm willing to take it.

769
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:52,539
Let's go.

770
00:39:56,409 --> 00:39:57,309
I have ADHD.

771
00:39:57,309 --> 00:39:58,110
I'm not a weirdo.

772
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:02,300
Wow.

773
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,599
Why do you have to be a weirdo?

774
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,000
If you have ADHD we're talking about.

775
00:40:12,289 --> 00:40:14,309
Oh silly zonka wonka.

776
00:40:14,309 --> 00:40:15,710
I have heard from Alexandra.

777
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,590
She needs to speak with you right away.

778
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:19,389
She will wait for you at the Hotel de Cuba.

779
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:20,289
Please go see her.

780
00:40:20,289 --> 00:40:20,889
All right, cool.

781
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,599
Somebody I have 110 cases.

782
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:32,599
I'll take two grand for this.

783
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:36,199
So expensive.

784
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:37,599
I'm almost out of raspberries.

785
00:40:38,659 --> 00:40:39,360
You have raspberries?

786
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:45,639
Damn it.

787
00:40:45,639 --> 00:40:46,639
What a waste of a trip.

788
00:40:53,429 --> 00:40:54,429
I hate that.

789
00:40:54,829 --> 00:40:55,630
I hate it.

790
00:40:55,829 --> 00:40:57,030
I should have sold it.

791
00:41:03,489 --> 00:41:03,989
I need a rock.

792
00:41:03,989 --> 00:41:05,389
Okay, let's do Arabian bold.

793
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,860
I have this Kona coffee.

794
00:41:09,889 --> 00:41:10,489
Moroccan coffee.

795
00:41:10,489 --> 00:41:12,889
Okay, I've used them almost all my Cuban coffee.

796
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,260
Who would buy?

797
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,659
Maybe if I go to Cuba, will they like that?

798
00:41:18,659 --> 00:41:19,559
I'm just gonna go to Cuba.

799
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,460
Cuban coffee in Cuba.

800
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:22,360
Have you not been to Cuba?

801
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,159
Have you not met Gina Famosa?

802
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:27,059
Have you not made me my cafe con leche?

803
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:33,199
This is the person that we owe like 40 cases of coffee to.

804
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,760
What happened to all your limes?

805
00:41:38,489 --> 00:41:39,690
I still have 880.

806
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:42,800
All right, come on.

807
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,400
Old Havana, Hotel de Cuba.

808
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:45,500
Here she is.

809
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:47,530
Silly zonka wonka.

810
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,429
I could not be more pleased with your progress.

811
00:41:49,829 --> 00:41:51,030
My search is proceeding.

812
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:54,539
Pace?

813
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,380
I fear that we are dealing with some pretty shady characters.

814
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:59,179
Do be careful about who you decide to trust.

815
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:04,619
But Link, hold on.

816
00:42:05,449 --> 00:42:06,550
Just hold on, hold on, hold on.

817
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:10,449
In any event, my travels have taken me to Bali, Indonesia.

818
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:12,949
Sean and I spent quite a bit of time in Indonesia, you know.

819
00:42:13,349 --> 00:42:15,650
And you, too, will now be able to visit this port.

820
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:19,550
Find Kintamani Plantation.

821
00:42:19,849 --> 00:42:22,250
The owner is a fan of quality confections.

822
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:24,150
Be sure to see him when you're able to make the trip.

823
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:25,250
Cool, new area.

824
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:26,710
All right, hold on.

825
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,179
I have to do this because I can't...

826
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:34,500
Blinks have to be really worth it, by the way,

827
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,059
because alt-tabbing is horrible.

828
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:38,860
The sign's gone too far.

829
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:42,929
All right, it is pretty dusty in here.

830
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,900
Now, you know what this looks like?

831
00:42:52,829 --> 00:42:57,269
This looks like you put, like, an old filter on Instagram.

832
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:01,239
You put film grain on this as an Instagram filter.

833
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:12,750
Is this image real or fake?

834
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:14,449
93% fail this quiz.

835
00:43:14,449 --> 00:43:15,250
Would you?

836
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,800
It is, it is speckles.

837
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:31,079
You get too...

838
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:33,179
Okay, I have to be really honest with you.

839
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:37,880
If you get too close with anything, it looks like this.

840
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:41,969
Ever seen what one of your skin cells looks like under a microscope?

841
00:43:45,429 --> 00:43:47,230
This is flash camera.

842
00:43:48,869 --> 00:43:50,670
Like, you have any idea what you look like right now?

843
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,539
You understand how many dust mites are all over your body?

844
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:55,349
Same exact deal.

845
00:43:55,349 --> 00:43:58,579
It's a flash camera that I took a picture of this.

846
00:44:03,019 --> 00:44:06,820
Right now, there are billions of just, like, bugs eating skin cells on your body.

847
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:08,420
I know I just freaked you all out, but go look it up.

848
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:13,260
What do you look like under a fucking microscope, I wonder?

849
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,099
There are dust mites all over us.

850
00:44:19,099 --> 00:44:19,500
Yeah.

851
00:44:24,659 --> 00:44:25,960
I cannot do any more alt tabs.

852
00:44:30,989 --> 00:44:31,889
No more alt tabbing.

853
00:44:34,869 --> 00:44:36,869
This game is like 15 years old.

854
00:44:40,039 --> 00:44:41,440
Irma has an attitude tonight.

855
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:43,039
What? No, I don't.

856
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:43,739
What are you talking about?

857
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:54,980
Okay, come on.

858
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:57,349
I'll take it.

859
00:44:58,699 --> 00:44:59,099
I'll take it.

860
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:00,500
I have 142 cases.

861
00:45:03,389 --> 00:45:04,289
This is 21.

862
00:45:04,289 --> 00:45:06,190
This is the best price I've seen so far.

863
00:45:06,889 --> 00:45:07,989
Let's see if I can get a little more.

864
00:45:08,989 --> 00:45:09,889
Are you here to do some business?

865
00:45:09,889 --> 00:45:11,090
You must do something for me here.

866
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:12,590
I'll be taking my wares elsewhere.

867
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:14,190
What are you trying to do here?

868
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:14,889
Rip me off?

869
00:45:25,849 --> 00:45:27,349
That's so much money.

870
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:28,849
I can't blow this.

871
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:32,320
This is breakeven pricing.

872
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:33,420
What are you talking about?

873
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:35,619
I got this is $300,000.

874
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:39,980
I'll be at more than half a million dollars.

875
00:45:49,139 --> 00:45:49,340
Done.

876
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:50,940
I need that.

877
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:52,440
The price is going to keep dropping.

878
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:53,639
I flooded the market.

879
00:45:53,639 --> 00:45:55,340
We're not going to see $5,000.

880
00:45:56,139 --> 00:45:57,440
Cuban claw cleaner ever again.

881
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:05,179
Come on.

882
00:46:08,219 --> 00:46:08,719
Honey, honey.

883
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:14,079
125k.

884
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:15,480
Let's go.

885
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,780
$125,000.

886
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:19,579
I'm almost at a million.

887
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:20,280
I'll get there.

888
00:46:24,139 --> 00:46:25,840
We're taking this out of circulation.

889
00:46:27,289 --> 00:46:28,789
I'm going to change my coffee to something else.

890
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:30,190
We're going to take this out of circulation too.

891
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Let's go back to coffee town.

892
00:46:36,349 --> 00:46:36,849
Cape Town.

893
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:39,579
Change the coffee.

894
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,139
All right, change the recipe.

895
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:48,760
Coffee.

896
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:49,360
What do we got?

897
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:52,230
I could do special blend.

898
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:53,429
I have enough.

899
00:46:53,429 --> 00:46:54,429
I have enough to make.

900
00:46:55,739 --> 00:46:57,039
I'm going to run out of Cuban coffee.

901
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,099
The person we need Arabian bold.

902
00:47:01,989 --> 00:47:07,960
We need 40 stacks of Arabian bold for one of the quests.

903
00:47:11,929 --> 00:47:13,030
Well, this game is about chocolate.

904
00:47:13,429 --> 00:47:18,099
It's about chocolate, coffee, lattes, and all kinds of other stuff.

905
00:47:20,429 --> 00:47:20,829
Raid?

906
00:47:20,829 --> 00:47:21,230
What raid?

907
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:22,500
I don't see a raid.

908
00:47:23,489 --> 00:47:24,590
Oh, it's because the thing's fucked up.

909
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:24,889
Hold on.

910
00:47:30,679 --> 00:47:31,480
I got to connect these.

911
00:47:32,829 --> 00:47:33,829
I want a huge one.

912
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:36,630
Nope, not yet.

913
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:42,880
Look at how big this is going to be.

914
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:57,800
Oh, I missed.

915
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:58,199
It's okay.

916
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:07,789
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

917
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:12,480
I hate its weird lag.

918
00:48:12,579 --> 00:48:14,380
It's almost like I shouldn't be using a mouse to do this.

919
00:48:15,039 --> 00:48:15,539
It's weird.

920
00:48:15,539 --> 00:48:16,239
It's really weird.

921
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:19,769
With 30 cases in that a week.

922
00:48:24,889 --> 00:48:25,690
Raid, raid.

923
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:27,579
I don't see anybody.

924
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:31,159
Okay, we got that.

925
00:48:31,159 --> 00:48:31,960
We have 30 of them.

926
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:33,760
Need to bring 40.

927
00:48:34,159 --> 00:48:35,260
Let me just check a few things here.

928
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:39,280
That's a good price.

929
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:40,619
Yeah, I'll take it.

930
00:48:42,369 --> 00:48:42,969
Is it going to get me?

931
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:44,710
$23,000.

932
00:48:44,809 --> 00:48:45,210
Nice.

933
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:47,889
Because I'm taking these out of circulation.

934
00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:54,849
Obama raid?

935
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:55,750
What are you talking about?

936
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:01,639
What are you guys doing?

937
00:49:03,139 --> 00:49:04,239
All right, we have to go.

938
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:05,820
Welcome.

939
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:07,320
I'm now stocking whipped cream.

940
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,219
It can be kind of pricey, but I recommend you pick some up.

941
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:14,150
$64 for whipped cream?

942
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:18,869
That seems kind of like a lot.

943
00:49:25,369 --> 00:49:25,969
I'm going to get some.

944
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:30,059
I can top that.

945
00:49:30,059 --> 00:49:31,260
I can put that on top of stuff.

946
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,400
Buy like $10,000.

947
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:42,230
Should I buy more than...

948
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:43,920
I'll buy...

949
00:49:44,219 --> 00:49:44,619
No, no, no.

950
00:49:44,619 --> 00:49:45,219
It'll go bad.

951
00:49:45,619 --> 00:49:46,320
I won't even use it.

952
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:47,519
I'll buy $200.

953
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:52,519
Anything else worth picking up while I'm here?

954
00:49:54,489 --> 00:49:55,989
I'm going to do enough raspberries.

955
00:49:55,989 --> 00:49:57,889
I'm going to buy 17 raspberries.

956
00:49:58,889 --> 00:50:01,889
Because I want at least one week of production here while I go back to Zurich.

957
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:03,260
Thank you.

958
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:05,349
And that's it.

959
00:50:08,019 --> 00:50:09,219
Because I'm going to change this.

960
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:15,920
I got the 40 cases.

961
00:50:16,019 --> 00:50:16,920
Have you not been to Cuba?

962
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:19,260
Have you not met Gina Famosa?

963
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:20,760
Have you not made my cafe con leche?

964
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:21,260
I have not.

965
00:50:21,659 --> 00:50:22,360
I have not made it yet.

966
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:23,260
I'm making something else.

967
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:28,820
Good price.

968
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:34,570
Change that recipe.

969
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:34,769
All right.

970
00:50:34,769 --> 00:50:35,369
What do I need to do?

971
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:36,670
Anybody have anything for me to do?

972
00:50:39,179 --> 00:50:39,880
Caribbean bold.

973
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:41,179
Cafe con leche.

974
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:42,420
All right.

975
00:50:43,349 --> 00:50:43,849
I need...

976
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:44,949
What should I make them?

977
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:46,650
What do I have?

978
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:48,750
All right.

979
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:51,050
I have the Sprite Sponge Bar, but I have no lemons.

980
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:52,949
I have 880 fucking limes.

981
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:53,849
What a waste.

982
00:50:55,079 --> 00:50:56,380
What an absolute waste.

983
00:50:56,579 --> 00:50:57,579
These are going to all go bad.

984
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:04,170
I guess I could just not make chocolate.

985
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:04,369
All right.

986
00:51:04,369 --> 00:51:05,170
Cafe con leche.

987
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:07,360
I need Cuban coffee.

988
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:09,559
I'm about to burn through all my Cuban coffee.

989
00:51:11,769 --> 00:51:13,769
This factory is not equipped to make this type of product.

990
00:51:13,769 --> 00:51:14,070
Oh.

991
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:18,500
To make this product, we'll need to equip the factory to make coffee.

992
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:21,099
It'll cost $250,000.

993
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,260
You want to purchase the machinery.

994
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:31,780
That's a lot of money.

995
00:51:38,119 --> 00:51:38,719
Maybe over the...

996
00:51:39,019 --> 00:51:39,619
Coffee is...

997
00:51:40,519 --> 00:51:40,820
No.

998
00:51:41,019 --> 00:51:41,519
Not worth it.

999
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:47,780
How many oranges do I have?

1000
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:48,880
188.

1001
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:51,539
Mint.

1002
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:53,239
Honey.

1003
00:51:55,199 --> 00:51:55,900
I can make these.

1004
00:51:57,889 --> 00:51:58,489
Yeah, let's make this.

1005
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:01,179
We're going to go for a lot.

1006
00:52:01,579 --> 00:52:02,780
Honey, people love chocolate and honey.

1007
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:13,179
Shit.

1008
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:13,780
I missed.

1009
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:19,730
Come on, come on, come on.

1010
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:20,230
Give me something.

1011
00:52:21,809 --> 00:52:22,809
Better than that, please.

1012
00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:23,710
Oh my God.

1013
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:24,309
This is terrible.

1014
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:29,980
Got it.

1015
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:30,179
Nice.

1016
00:52:30,179 --> 00:52:30,679
Full stack.

1017
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:41,360
Give me a full stack.

1018
00:52:42,639 --> 00:52:43,440
Stop screaming.

1019
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:44,239
What are you yelling at?

1020
00:52:47,989 --> 00:52:49,789
Give me a full stack.

1021
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:51,269
Jesus.

1022
00:52:58,420 --> 00:52:59,320
He's going to make it faster.

1023
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:00,019
I got to concentrate.

1024
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:08,159
Okay, that's fine.

1025
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:11,050
Oh, give me a full stack.

1026
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:14,659
Okay.

1027
00:53:16,039 --> 00:53:18,840
Now we're going to change the recipe again because that's all I can't make anymore.

1028
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:19,539
And we're going to make it something.

1029
00:53:19,539 --> 00:53:20,340
We do oranges.

1030
00:53:24,019 --> 00:53:24,519
Make.

1031
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:25,519
Oh, it's not.

1032
00:53:25,519 --> 00:53:26,519
I can do better than 19 a week.

1033
00:53:26,519 --> 00:53:26,820
Can I?

1034
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:31,780
I could get that to like 25.

1035
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:32,179
Can't I?

1036
00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:39,250
Make lime chocolate.

1037
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:47,800
Back it up.

1038
00:54:07,610 --> 00:54:08,010
Come on.

1039
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:09,110
I need a stack, please.

1040
00:54:15,070 --> 00:54:15,869
Shit, I missed.

1041
00:54:28,219 --> 00:54:29,219
Give me more nuts.

1042
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:31,449
Come on.

1043
00:54:39,969 --> 00:54:40,269
That's good.

1044
00:54:40,269 --> 00:54:40,570
That's good.

1045
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:41,469
That's better than 20.

1046
00:54:41,469 --> 00:54:42,269
That's better than 19.

1047
00:54:43,070 --> 00:54:43,670
That's 24.

1048
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:48,929
There we go.

1049
00:54:48,929 --> 00:54:49,230
All right.

1050
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:50,130
Now let that just run.

1051
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:52,030
Well, I'm going to make a ton of orange chocolate.

1052
00:54:52,429 --> 00:54:53,429
I have enough for six weeks.

1053
00:54:53,429 --> 00:54:55,530
I need more Moroccan coffee.

1054
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:06,280
We need Moroccan coffee and I need to go hand this in to Tangier.

1055
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:07,380
All right, let's go.

1056
00:55:11,519 --> 00:55:12,420
You're ignoring chat.

1057
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:15,320
Yeah, because like all it is is just people saying like Obama raid.

1058
00:55:16,019 --> 00:55:17,519
What do you want me to pull out from here?

1059
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,800
You want me to just stare at the chat while I just say Obama raid, Obama raid.

1060
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:24,699
Look, it's Obama.

1061
00:55:24,699 --> 00:55:25,599
Obama's here.

1062
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:26,599
Obama raid.

1063
00:55:26,599 --> 00:55:29,599
What kind of what am I pulling from the chat that I'm not seeing?

1064
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:31,199
That I didn't see eight minutes ago.

1065
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:36,199
Oh, hold on.

1066
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:43,980
Good to see you back in Tangier, silly zonkawonka.

1067
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:47,079
Listen, there will be some mighty fine cinnamon available here soon.

1068
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:50,780
Now that's an ingredient used in loads of delicious coffee recipes.

1069
00:55:51,079 --> 00:55:54,280
In fact, I've got one such recipe for you here.

1070
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:55,579
I give it to you now.

1071
00:55:55,579 --> 00:55:57,079
Will you be willing to do something for me?

1072
00:55:57,380 --> 00:56:02,710
Yep, cinnamon, cinnamon coffee.

1073
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:04,110
People go nuts over this shit.

1074
00:56:08,119 --> 00:56:12,420
It's gonna make a regular coffee with a regular like just Folger's coffee beans

1075
00:56:13,019 --> 00:56:18,730
and then just tap two things of cinnamon on top of it and sell it for nine bucks.

1076
00:56:20,239 --> 00:56:23,639
Oh, wow.

1077
00:56:23,639 --> 00:56:24,639
Cinnamon coffee.

1078
00:56:24,639 --> 00:56:25,639
Yep, that'll be nine dollars.

1079
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:30,980
60 cases.

1080
00:56:38,989 --> 00:56:39,989
No, they're not smelling.

1081
00:56:39,989 --> 00:56:41,289
No, it's not sniffing it.

1082
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:42,920
They're not going.

1083
00:56:44,019 --> 00:56:44,920
I mean, they could be.

1084
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:48,019
I'm sure that some people that buy coffee do that.

1085
00:56:50,119 --> 00:56:54,119
Swell brings 60 cases of chocolate with caramel here in town.

1086
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:56,659
Oh, okay.

1087
00:56:56,659 --> 00:57:01,360
So I have to make 60 cases of caramel chocolate to get to unlock cinnamon.

1088
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:02,960
Okay.

1089
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:04,059
That's a lot.

1090
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:08,239
It is here.

1091
00:57:08,239 --> 00:57:09,340
I delivered my 40.

1092
00:57:11,239 --> 00:57:18,840
Ooh, another recipe.

1093
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:27,420
Coffee mint, coffee with mint, Colombian coffee, Moroccan coffee and mint.

1094
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:28,619
I don't have any mint.

1095
00:57:28,619 --> 00:57:29,320
So whatever.

1096
00:57:30,119 --> 00:57:33,119
I think we should explore entering into a partnership for this shop.

1097
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:35,559
It would be many benefits for you.

1098
00:57:35,559 --> 00:57:38,760
For starters, I'd always offer you the highest prices for your wares.

1099
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:42,960
More importantly, I'd be able to start taking special orders on your behalf.

1100
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:44,679
Really?

1101
00:57:46,099 --> 00:57:47,300
Special orders work like this.

1102
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:52,599
I'll accept orders on your behalf and then send you a telegram with the details of each order as I receive them.

1103
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:59,000
You can decide whether or not to accept each order, but I assure you special orders command the highest profit margins you will ever see.

1104
00:58:00,590 --> 00:58:04,590
I will incur some startup costs to get the special order system up and running.

1105
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:07,690
If you're willing to share these costs by bringing me some products,

1106
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:11,789
we'll be square and I'll be ready to enter into the partnership we discussed.

1107
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:12,489
Deal?

1108
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:18,599
Deal.

1109
00:58:20,099 --> 00:58:20,800
Splendid!

1110
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:25,159
While I don't carry chocolates in my shop, I love them all the same.

1111
00:58:25,559 --> 00:58:30,159
First, bring me 100 cases of special reserve 66% African cocoa.

1112
00:58:32,070 --> 00:58:32,670
Holy shit.

1113
00:58:33,170 --> 00:58:33,969
This goes for a lot.

1114
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:38,599
Oh wait, we're in a partnership, aren't we?

1115
00:58:40,619 --> 00:58:41,420
Oh, not yet.

1116
00:58:48,889 --> 00:58:49,789
I need, um...

1117
00:58:50,489 --> 00:58:51,389
I need Moroccan coffee.

1118
00:58:52,519 --> 00:58:53,019
Yes, it's true.

1119
00:58:53,019 --> 00:58:55,820
I'm expecting a new spice soon and I'd be happy to offer you for sale.

1120
00:58:56,219 --> 00:58:58,519
As soon as you show up with 60 cases of chocolate with caramel.

1121
00:59:01,550 --> 00:59:02,550
I need, um...

1122
00:59:08,239 --> 00:59:09,440
I need more coffee.

1123
00:59:09,639 --> 00:59:11,340
I need more, um, Moroccan coffee.

1124
00:59:15,829 --> 00:59:16,230
Okay.

1125
00:59:18,699 --> 00:59:19,199
That's a lot.

1126
00:59:27,269 --> 00:59:27,769
Yes!

1127
00:59:29,929 --> 00:59:30,329
Good deal.

1128
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:34,760
So I need a lot of Moroccan coffee.

1129
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:36,260
Let's do 200.

1130
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:38,480
Okay.

1131
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:38,679
Yeah.

1132
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:39,079
Yep.

1133
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:39,780
That's fine.

1134
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:40,280
I'll make it back.

1135
00:59:42,469 --> 00:59:43,869
Can we get a battery cam?

1136
00:59:47,519 --> 00:59:48,019
No.

1137
00:59:48,949 --> 00:59:49,849
No, you can't.

1138
00:59:50,449 --> 00:59:52,750
No, there will be no battery cam.

1139
00:59:58,449 --> 00:59:58,650
All right.

1140
00:59:58,650 --> 00:59:59,750
This is going to keep producing.

1141
01:00:00,489 --> 01:00:00,989
I'm going to go.

1142
01:00:00,989 --> 01:00:01,489
I need it.

1143
01:00:01,989 --> 01:00:06,590
I'm going to go make a reserve recipe.

1144
01:00:06,590 --> 01:00:06,989
Hold on.

1145
01:00:09,489 --> 01:00:10,190
This is...

1146
01:00:11,289 --> 01:00:12,289
...Dualan cocoa...

1147
01:00:12,989 --> 01:00:13,590
...and sugar.

1148
01:00:14,429 --> 01:00:15,329
I have a ton...

1149
01:00:15,329 --> 01:00:16,130
I was prepared.

1150
01:00:16,130 --> 01:00:17,630
Remember I bought this at a discount and everyone said,

1151
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:18,530
Jerma, don't buy that.

1152
01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:19,230
What are you buying that for?

1153
01:00:19,230 --> 01:00:20,230
I bought it at a discount.

1154
01:00:20,230 --> 01:00:21,230
I haggled with the guy.

1155
01:00:21,429 --> 01:00:22,429
Now I have a shitload of it.

1156
01:00:22,630 --> 01:00:23,429
I need a hundred of these.

1157
01:00:25,239 --> 01:00:25,840
Let's go back to Zurich.

1158
01:00:37,519 --> 01:00:38,019
Good price.

1159
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:40,780
That's a good price.

1160
01:00:46,170 --> 01:00:47,070
That's a good price too.

1161
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,699
72 cases of this shit.

1162
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:52,699
Nice.

1163
01:00:54,409 --> 01:00:55,210
I'm holding onto this.

1164
01:00:55,210 --> 01:00:55,710
This is going to be...

1165
01:00:55,710 --> 01:00:57,710
I'm going to make so much money on this.

1166
01:00:57,710 --> 01:00:58,610
This would be, uh...

1167
01:00:59,409 --> 01:01:01,210
This would be like 50 times what I put in.

1168
01:01:02,699 --> 01:01:02,900
All right.

1169
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:04,099
I need to make the...

1170
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:05,599
...this one here.

1171
01:01:07,269 --> 01:01:08,369
26 cases per week.

1172
01:01:08,369 --> 01:01:09,969
I don't need to do the thing.

1173
01:01:10,070 --> 01:01:10,670
That's good enough.

1174
01:01:12,639 --> 01:01:13,739
We want to see the battery.

1175
01:01:14,039 --> 01:01:14,539
No.

1176
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:16,539
You don't need to see the battery.

1177
01:01:19,619 --> 01:01:19,920
All right.

1178
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:20,519
Should I...

1179
01:01:22,570 --> 01:01:23,769
Do I have space to do?

1180
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:26,840
No, I don't have any room.

1181
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:28,239
Why can I delete these?

1182
01:01:28,239 --> 01:01:29,239
These are such junk.

1183
01:01:29,239 --> 01:01:30,039
I want to delete them.

1184
01:01:36,519 --> 01:01:37,719
Maybe I should just keep making this.

1185
01:01:41,309 --> 01:01:42,610
Open up a new factory.

1186
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:47,659
What do I got for quest right now?

1187
01:01:47,659 --> 01:01:48,460
A new spice.

1188
01:01:48,659 --> 01:01:49,059
Okay.

1189
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:53,920
I need 60 cases of the chocolate with caramel.

1190
01:01:54,619 --> 01:01:55,719
I'm doing this first.

1191
01:01:56,849 --> 01:01:58,650
Because I'm bringing 100 cases to this guy.

1192
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:01,320
So then I get a partnership with this guy.

1193
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:03,920
And then I can sell this Arabian Bold...

1194
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:06,219
...for the maximum profit to this guy.

1195
01:02:10,070 --> 01:02:10,570
Oh shit.

1196
01:02:10,570 --> 01:02:10,969
I forgot.

1197
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:15,300
I need 24 cases of cafe con leche.

1198
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:15,699
Shit.

1199
01:02:17,369 --> 01:02:18,570
I keep blowing that lady off.

1200
01:02:18,969 --> 01:02:19,269
Okay.

1201
01:02:19,269 --> 01:02:19,769
How much...

1202
01:02:19,769 --> 01:02:20,570
What does it take?

1203
01:02:24,869 --> 01:02:25,269
Cuban...

1204
01:02:25,269 --> 01:02:26,170
I need more Cuban coffee.

1205
01:02:26,570 --> 01:02:31,980
It's Cuban coffee, milk, and sugar.

1206
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:32,679
All right.

1207
01:02:32,679 --> 01:02:33,280
Let's go to Cuba.

1208
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:41,280
I don't have it yet.

1209
01:02:41,679 --> 01:02:44,289
Oh, wait.

1210
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:48,900
Silly zonka wonka.

1211
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:51,800
I understand whipped cream has recently become available.

1212
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:54,199
I have a recipe here that uses that very ingredient.

1213
01:02:54,599 --> 01:02:55,900
Coffee with whipped cream.

1214
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:57,400
What a recipe.

1215
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,599
Wow.

1216
01:03:01,079 --> 01:03:03,780
Coffee with whipped cream on top?

1217
01:03:04,449 --> 01:03:05,550
What's the secret?

1218
01:03:05,849 --> 01:03:07,349
What are you holding back from us?

1219
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,219
Holy smokes.

1220
01:03:11,139 --> 01:03:13,139
What do I need to get the secret from you?

1221
01:03:14,579 --> 01:03:16,679
If you'd be willing to take 28 cases to...

1222
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:19,079
...Nino Brager in Zurich...

1223
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:20,679
...he will pay you well for the goods.

1224
01:03:20,679 --> 01:03:21,380
Sure.

1225
01:03:22,110 --> 01:03:23,409
Oh, boy.

1226
01:03:25,329 --> 01:03:26,429
The secret recipe.

1227
01:03:27,130 --> 01:03:28,429
It's brew a coffee...

1228
01:03:28,929 --> 01:03:31,030
...and then hold the can upside down and go...

1229
01:03:34,199 --> 01:03:36,500
...only your great-great-great-grandmother knew that.

1230
01:03:46,639 --> 01:03:47,440
So expensive.

1231
01:03:49,809 --> 01:03:51,210
Although this is actually on the low end.

1232
01:03:52,869 --> 01:03:53,670
Last seen in...

1233
01:03:54,070 --> 01:03:54,369
Okay.

1234
01:03:54,469 --> 01:03:57,269
The last time I was here, this is $515 a stack.

1235
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:02,300
Do I dare try to come down?

1236
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:03,300
I mean, this is on the low end.

1237
01:04:06,309 --> 01:04:07,309
No, no, no, no, no.

1238
01:04:07,309 --> 01:04:08,210
It's already so good.

1239
01:04:14,289 --> 01:04:14,590
Here we go.

1240
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:22,599
All right.

1241
01:04:22,599 --> 01:04:23,699
That was $100,000.

1242
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:24,500
$100,000.

1243
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:26,199
There's $520 grand in here.

1244
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:29,360
There's a hundred fucking thousand dollars on the line.

1245
01:04:30,159 --> 01:04:30,860
Just do not...

1246
01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:31,960
There's three Whammies here.

1247
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:32,860
Don't click a Whammy.

1248
01:04:33,559 --> 01:04:33,960
All right.

1249
01:04:40,010 --> 01:04:40,710
Okay, we're almost...

1250
01:04:41,710 --> 01:04:42,010
All right.

1251
01:04:42,010 --> 01:04:42,210
All right.

1252
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:42,510
All right.

1253
01:04:42,510 --> 01:04:42,809
All right.

1254
01:04:43,449 --> 01:04:44,150
I'm up.

1255
01:04:44,550 --> 01:04:44,949
One more.

1256
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:46,050
I'm done.

1257
01:04:50,730 --> 01:04:51,730
Oh, fuck yeah.

1258
01:04:56,449 --> 01:04:57,250
Oh, hell yeah.

1259
01:04:57,250 --> 01:04:58,150
That felt good.

1260
01:04:58,949 --> 01:04:59,550
That felt good.

1261
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:03,199
I haven't really used any Allspice.

1262
01:05:06,530 --> 01:05:07,530
Let us choose.

1263
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:10,699
It's gonna be really hard to do.

1264
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:11,599
I would...

1265
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:17,199
I really want to do that, but like alt-tabbing and turning on the extension and getting it to be in the right spot might be hard.

1266
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:19,719
We'll see.

1267
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:20,719
Maybe I'll do it later.

1268
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,400
Thank you, James, for the ten community...

1269
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:24,900
Oh, sorry.

1270
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:26,599
Thank you, James, for the ten community subs.

1271
01:05:27,559 --> 01:05:27,960
Thanks a lot.

1272
01:05:29,170 --> 01:05:30,070
Ten fucking subs.

1273
01:05:31,219 --> 01:05:31,619
Thanks you.

1274
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:32,420
Thanks you.

1275
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:33,619
Thanks you.

1276
01:05:35,389 --> 01:05:36,690
I thanks you.

1277
01:05:38,139 --> 01:05:38,940
He hates us.

1278
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:39,940
No, I don't.

1279
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:41,639
I just hate alt-tabbing.

1280
01:05:44,369 --> 01:05:45,170
No, don't sell.

1281
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:47,010
All right.

1282
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:51,480
I have to bring $100,000 using whipped cream.

1283
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:55,480
Yeah, this guy just...

1284
01:05:56,179 --> 01:05:58,780
Don't you feel like you want to go visit this guy and just pull him aside and be like,

1285
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:05,659
Nino, just buy the whipped cream and just put it on top of your coffee.

1286
01:06:05,659 --> 01:06:07,059
You don't need me to do this for you.

1287
01:06:07,869 --> 01:06:08,170
I don't...

1288
01:06:08,170 --> 01:06:08,769
You don't have...

1289
01:06:08,769 --> 01:06:10,469
I don't have to do this part for you.

1290
01:06:15,179 --> 01:06:15,380
All right.

1291
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:15,980
So let's do...

1292
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:20,079
We're looking for $100,000, which we have $26,000.

1293
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:20,880
It's gonna take a few weeks.

1294
01:06:25,679 --> 01:06:26,380
I need to just...

1295
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:29,380
I'm gonna just travel around and get ingredients.

1296
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:30,679
What am I low on?

1297
01:06:31,150 --> 01:06:32,050
I'm about to sneeze again.

1298
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:33,880
I didn't even sneeze once today.

1299
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:35,389
Why am I saying again?

1300
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:48,760
What about the lady?

1301
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:52,500
You got her killed.

1302
01:06:59,989 --> 01:07:03,389
Somebody came in here and like killed me and muted the microphone right by...

1303
01:07:03,389 --> 01:07:03,889
How?

1304
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:09,300
I would probably have made more noise than that.

1305
01:07:20,699 --> 01:07:22,300
A dagger thrown into me?

1306
01:07:22,599 --> 01:07:23,199
Yeah, but wouldn't...

1307
01:07:23,199 --> 01:07:27,400
Okay, if a dagger was thrown across the room, like into my neck, I wouldn't be...

1308
01:07:27,699 --> 01:07:28,400
I would be like...

1309
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:32,500
I would be like...

1310
01:07:35,639 --> 01:07:36,139
Wouldn't I?

1311
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:41,440
It was a laser weapon.

1312
01:07:46,530 --> 01:07:48,230
Yeah, it was like a vaporizing ray.

1313
01:07:48,730 --> 01:07:54,030
I look over, I see this big green alien with like a big like Mars attacks head.

1314
01:07:55,119 --> 01:07:55,920
He just goes like...

1315
01:07:58,480 --> 01:07:59,679
I see him and I see the beam.

1316
01:07:59,679 --> 01:08:00,480
That's all you get.

1317
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:02,539
I got discombobulated.

1318
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:16,739
Okay.

1319
01:08:18,090 --> 01:08:19,090
Oh, I can go here.

1320
01:08:21,550 --> 01:08:22,649
I don't have to bring something here though.

1321
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:27,460
All right.

1322
01:08:27,460 --> 01:08:30,359
This is a new area I got and I have $600,000.

1323
01:08:31,159 --> 01:08:31,859
Island Temple.

1324
01:08:33,119 --> 01:08:33,720
Oh shit.

1325
01:08:35,710 --> 01:08:36,810
She's following me around.

1326
01:08:38,159 --> 01:08:40,260
She's getting on the same planes as me now.

1327
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:43,420
Just loading her bags in the overhead.

1328
01:08:45,090 --> 01:08:46,189
Oh, hey, have you been to Cuba?

1329
01:08:46,189 --> 01:08:47,689
Have you met China Famosa?

1330
01:08:47,689 --> 01:08:48,090
Oh, yeah.

1331
01:08:48,590 --> 01:08:50,289
By the way, I'm in 24C.

1332
01:08:50,289 --> 01:08:52,590
Have you made my cafe con leche yet, motherfucker?

1333
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:57,760
She's following me around.

1334
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:06,039
The shadow market?

1335
01:09:06,739 --> 01:09:07,239
What did that say?

1336
01:09:09,010 --> 01:09:09,810
Click on ingredient.

1337
01:09:11,739 --> 01:09:13,140
Allspice is gonna be real cheaper.

1338
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:13,539
I know it.

1339
01:09:17,819 --> 01:09:18,220
Sweets.

1340
01:09:20,449 --> 01:09:21,050
I can't sell.

1341
01:09:26,119 --> 01:09:26,520
Hold on.

1342
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:27,979
Welcome to Indonesia.

1343
01:09:28,579 --> 01:09:31,279
Will we cultivate some of the world's finest specialty ingredients?

1344
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:32,979
Your reputation precedes you.

1345
01:09:33,479 --> 01:09:34,779
Silly zonko wanka.

1346
01:09:35,260 --> 01:09:37,760
I've heard tell of some of your creations.

1347
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:40,260
Tart of the Moon and Sprite Sponge.

1348
01:09:41,050 --> 01:09:43,649
If you were to bring me just 10 cases of each of those delights,

1349
01:09:44,050 --> 01:09:47,350
I will not only make our wonderful cacao and coffee beans available to you,

1350
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:50,520
I'd also hand over a couple of recipes that take advantage of the same.

1351
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:51,720
What say you?

1352
01:09:52,699 --> 01:09:53,199
Um,

1353
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:55,859
No, he's heard of some of the creations,

1354
01:09:55,859 --> 01:09:57,359
but he doesn't know how they taste.

1355
01:09:57,970 --> 01:09:58,670
Word has not

1356
01:09:59,069 --> 01:09:59,470
gotten

1357
01:09:59,970 --> 01:10:00,270
here.

1358
01:10:00,909 --> 01:10:01,710
Of how bad they are.

1359
01:10:02,439 --> 01:10:02,739
So,

1360
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:03,739
I'm going to,

1361
01:10:04,039 --> 01:10:04,539
hopefully,

1362
01:10:05,310 --> 01:10:06,310
over the next few weeks,

1363
01:10:06,609 --> 01:10:09,210
bring you these things, get your recipes before you take a bite.

1364
01:10:15,829 --> 01:10:16,930
Please make the con leche.

1365
01:10:16,930 --> 01:10:18,029
I know, I have to, I've,

1366
01:10:18,529 --> 01:10:19,329
I've got to do this first.

1367
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:22,050
I will, that sounds good.

1368
01:10:23,039 --> 01:10:26,039
So I just have to bring 10 cases of Tart of the Moon and Sprite Sponge

1369
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:29,220
to Santoso

1370
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:30,619
Devi in Bali.

1371
01:10:38,010 --> 01:10:38,310
Okay,

1372
01:10:38,609 --> 01:10:39,409
Tart of the Moon.

1373
01:10:43,479 --> 01:10:45,180
Oh, I can't do anything here until I bring this guy

1374
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:46,579
my specialty treats.

1375
01:10:48,689 --> 01:10:50,489
All right, I'll get you your cafe con leche.

1376
01:10:50,489 --> 01:10:51,390
I promise.

1377
01:10:52,859 --> 01:10:54,060
All right, back to,

1378
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:56,659
all right, is that

1379
01:10:56,859 --> 01:10:57,460
78,

1380
01:10:57,859 --> 01:10:59,260
88, 90, okay, yeah.

1381
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:00,260
Here we go.

1382
01:11:00,659 --> 01:11:01,560
We're going back

1383
01:11:02,420 --> 01:11:03,020
to this guy.

1384
01:11:05,199 --> 01:11:06,399
We have to go to Tangiers.

1385
01:11:08,470 --> 01:11:09,170
It's time.

1386
01:11:11,699 --> 01:11:12,800
What a scrumptious cake.

1387
01:11:17,470 --> 01:11:18,170
Is that what it was?

1388
01:11:20,829 --> 01:11:22,930
Holy shit, you just like triggered a memory.

1389
01:11:24,659 --> 01:11:27,760
I think it was SpongeBob was doing like a scrumptious cake

1390
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:28,659
Neelix bit

1391
01:11:31,239 --> 01:11:32,340
on TBS

1392
01:11:32,539 --> 01:11:33,439
in Star Trek.

1393
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:35,579
I think that's what it was.

1394
01:11:35,779 --> 01:11:36,680
You just like triggered it.

1395
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:37,880
I think that's actually what happened.

1396
01:11:39,319 --> 01:11:40,220
He was like, Patrick,

1397
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:42,520
I just made the most scrumptious cake.

1398
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:45,220
Ah, I actually think that's what happened.

1399
01:11:47,359 --> 01:11:47,960
All right, here we go.

1400
01:11:55,220 --> 01:11:56,220
Just about got everything in order.

1401
01:11:56,220 --> 01:11:58,220
All you need to do is bring me the hundred cases of mocha

1402
01:11:58,220 --> 01:11:59,220
and hundred, what?

1403
01:12:04,470 --> 01:12:06,069
I have to bring you a hundred cases of mocha

1404
01:12:06,069 --> 01:12:08,569
and a hundred cases of Sprite Sponge?

1405
01:12:11,239 --> 01:12:12,539
You fucker.

1406
01:12:15,170 --> 01:12:16,569
Well, I need to get rid of this stuff.

1407
01:12:19,420 --> 01:12:22,619
He's got 25 community subs from Nuclear Waffle.

1408
01:12:23,789 --> 01:12:24,989
That's a huge subs.

1409
01:12:25,289 --> 01:12:25,789
Thank you.

1410
01:12:28,390 --> 01:12:30,489
Thank you for the absolutely gigantic subs.

1411
01:12:38,010 --> 01:12:39,810
Huge community subs.

1412
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:41,239
Okay.

1413
01:12:41,239 --> 01:12:42,039
So what is it?

1414
01:12:42,140 --> 01:12:43,739
What is let me see Sprite.

1415
01:12:43,739 --> 01:12:45,140
What does it need to make Sprite Sponge?

1416
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:48,220
I don't stock this.

1417
01:12:49,310 --> 01:12:49,710
I don't.

1418
01:12:49,810 --> 01:12:50,710
Oh, they're going bad.

1419
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:55,359
A hundred and eighty have gone bad in the last couple of weeks.

1420
01:12:55,359 --> 01:12:56,260
We have to get rid of these.

1421
01:12:59,140 --> 01:13:00,239
I need lemons.

1422
01:13:01,659 --> 01:13:03,460
I don't want you to put these in stock though.

1423
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:04,460
No one likes this.

1424
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:08,319
You're a zero factor.

1425
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:09,119
I don't.

1426
01:13:11,850 --> 01:13:12,250
Okay.

1427
01:13:12,449 --> 01:13:13,649
So we have to get lemons.

1428
01:13:13,649 --> 01:13:14,550
I have plenty of milk.

1429
01:13:15,350 --> 01:13:16,550
Obviously plenty of limes.

1430
01:13:16,550 --> 01:13:17,750
And now I need a hundred lemons.

1431
01:13:19,319 --> 01:13:20,819
Mocha is

1432
01:13:22,939 --> 01:13:23,939
I need Kona coffee.

1433
01:13:23,939 --> 01:13:25,039
I need a bunch more milk.

1434
01:13:25,439 --> 01:13:26,039
God damn it.

1435
01:13:26,039 --> 01:13:39,800
Why would I put milk in this recipe?

1436
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:40,100
Now?

1437
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:44,979
I need to have like 200 more milk.

1438

Alright now we're gonna go back to Zurich get the lemons and then we're gonna change the coffee

1470
01:17:54,119 --> 01:17:58,939
I'm gonna go to K. I should have gone to Cape Town first. All right, I need lemons

1471
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:09,279
Okay, of course your prices went up. I need a hundred lemons. I'll just get 150

1476
01:19:43,890 --> 01:19:45,659

1477
01:19:45,659 --> 01:19:47,659

1478
01:19:47,739 --> 01:19:57,090
Rot to the point where I can't even make a hundred best game or moment 2021

1479
01:19:57,090 --> 01:20:01,430
I missed I'm too many the minigames too stressful it I know it is kind of stressful

1480
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:04,170
You only have to do it once per batch. So if you really don't care

1481
01:20:07,579 --> 01:20:18,100
Lemons can rot and lemons go bad in real life. Yeah, they can eat a rotten lime on stream

1482
01:20:18,340 --> 01:20:24,140
Why do I have this weird thing in my brain that lemons have this self

1483
01:20:24,899 --> 01:20:26,420
sustainable internal

1484
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:30,779
Like it they like back to like a lemon juice is so sour and so acidic

1485
01:20:31,220 --> 01:20:34,140
Like it cannot go bad because it kills all the bacteria and germs in the middle

1486
01:20:34,380 --> 01:20:39,739
Why do I have this weird thing that as long as the skins on they have like a whole ecosystem where they can be?

1487
01:20:39,739 --> 01:20:45,140
Like clean in there. I know that's not true. But why do I think it could be?

1488
01:20:50,930 --> 01:20:52,369
immortal lemons

1489
01:20:52,369 --> 01:20:58,800
Because you're dumb. No, it was it's just a little thought project. I know that lemons go bad

1490
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:03,800
I'm just saying like I why is it my mind a lemon is like this ecosystem that is

1491
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:26,060
Immutable, you know, it's kind of like blockchain technology. You've heard of that yet because you're two feet tall pan that person for at least an hour

1492
01:21:26,539 --> 01:21:35,470
What's that have to do with anything? All right, I'm gonna

1493
01:21:36,090 --> 01:21:45,750
Please have my limes not go bad. All right coffee coffee coffee coffee. We're gonna mocha. Do I have enough for mocha?

1494
01:21:45,750 --> 01:21:54,680
I have so many coffee beans. No cocoa beans. All right, we are ready to make

1495
01:21:55,319 --> 01:22:10,859
Mocha at the coffee factory down in Cape Town already almost had a lemon. Okay, let's go change a recipe

1496
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:20,300
Mocha use this recipe 32 a week. That's fine. Look at how much of this I have

1497
01:22:20,979 --> 01:22:27,430
359 Arabian bold cases, but that's not single coffees. That's stacks of this those cases

1498
01:22:28,069 --> 01:22:36,199
How many coffees are in a case? I have no idea trying not to burp on camera. This is like

1499
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:43,850
3500 coffee. Oh black tea is going bad too. Great

1500
01:22:48,409 --> 01:22:56,529
Whipped cream I need to get that secret whipped cream recipe. What about the cafe con leche? I'm that's not

1501
01:22:57,289 --> 01:23:06,579
That's not a precedent right now. That's the wrong word. Okay, I got that going. Let's head back to

1502
01:23:07,359 --> 01:23:21,649
Need a hundred sprite sponges. Wait, doesn't somebody else want sprite sponges too? Oh tar the moon, right?

1503
01:23:21,810 --> 01:23:28,140
This is what this is the most important one is something else I can do

1504
01:23:28,619 --> 01:23:33,550
I'm trying to find cheap

1505
01:23:33,989 --> 01:23:50,560
I could use more. Oh, I could use my dwelling cocoa or I have I don't have any Cuban coffee

1506
01:23:50,560 --> 01:24:12,390
Let's go to Havana. No links tonight. Nope, not right now. Holy shit. Holy shit. Holy shit. Holy shit. That's $400,000

1507
01:24:12,390 --> 01:24:14,869
Oh my god, that's 400 grand. Holy shit. I must get a million dollars

1508
01:24:16,939 --> 01:24:24,760
Wow. Oh, wow. Okay. Don't I'm never gambling ever again in the game because that's like half a million dollars almost

1509
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:36,760
It's a lot of coffee. Why is tea so expensive? Listen friend. I just harvested it. Oh

1510
01:24:43,619 --> 01:24:50,350
Like I just walked into the store and bumped my elbow on the like the side opening the door to the shop

1511
01:24:50,369 --> 01:24:57,880
It's the dagger the reaction instead of being like

1512
01:25:00,539 --> 01:25:02,779
No, no, no, it's how

1513
01:25:03,260 --> 01:25:14,779
Then I'm dead. Listen friend. I just harvested a bumper crop of coffee beans here

1514
01:25:14,819 --> 01:25:18,850
There's not a whole lot I can do on the price, but I'd be willing to trade

1515
01:25:19,649 --> 01:25:22,689
5,000 sacks of

1516
01:25:22,689 --> 01:25:32,729
Cuban coffee for 75 cases of special blend. Are you kidding me? That's five

1517
01:25:33,369 --> 01:25:40,699
Okay, hold on. It's like 300 to 400 bucks a sack. I need to do some calculation here. It's like

1518
01:25:42,659 --> 01:25:48,560
$340 a sec to 340 times 5,000

1519
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:56,109
That's one point seven million dollars of product for just 75 cases of special blend

1520
01:25:56,109 --> 01:26:04,899
How much does it cost to make special blend? Isn't special blend just all three of them? Holy shit. That's incredible

1521
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:23,130
Why would you be giving this to me? That's four hundred times. This is two million dollars in inventory. Why would I buy this? No

1522
01:26:24,449 --> 01:26:30,420
Excuse me. No, I'm not gonna buy any of that from you. Amen

1523
01:26:30,420 --> 01:26:33,859

1528
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:16,890
All right. I'm almost at the sprite sponge, which I probably should go

01:57:32,279 --> 01:57:34,279
Oh, that's a lot

1726
01:57:35,500 --> 01:57:37,500
Oh, that's a lot too

1727
01:57:38,739 --> 01:57:43,380
All right. I need to go back to where's the guy where's my guy that takes all coffee

1728
01:57:44,100 --> 01:57:46,979
Look, just take these just take these gross things from me

1729
01:57:51,909 --> 01:57:53,909
Wait, did I do the thing and yeah, I did okay

1730
01:57:57,289 --> 01:58:00,140
I need to keep the caramel

1731
01:58:00,140 --> 01:58:01,899
I have 60

1732
01:58:01,899 --> 01:58:03,899
All coffee now is gonna get sold to the other guy

1733
01:58:06,869 --> 01:58:08,869
So now where is this?

1734
01:58:10,300 --> 01:58:17,829
Okay, whipped cream that's zurich and this is in

1735
01:58:19,029 --> 01:58:20,949
uh

1736
01:58:20,949 --> 01:58:23,270
Tangiers, okay tangers and then zurg. Let's go

1737
01:58:23,909 --> 01:58:36,680
Okay, make sure that you're continually introducing new coffees. Here we go. These chocolate bars of caramel are simply scrumptious

1738
01:58:36,760 --> 01:58:40,279
So they are scrumptious. Of course they are I made them

1739
01:58:41,180 --> 01:58:45,260
In exchange, I'd like to present you with 200 sacks of a wonderful spice cinnamon

1740
01:58:46,789 --> 01:58:53,350
Eppin you won't find finer cinnamon anywhere in the world. Be sure to come back. You need any more nice. Holy shit. That's good

1741
01:58:54,449 --> 01:58:58,149
200 that's 157 000 in inventory for free

1742
01:59:00,279 --> 01:59:07,640
I didn't do anything

1743
01:59:07,640 --> 01:59:12,939
Very nice. Welcome back to your shop. Silly zonka wonka. It is always a pleasure to see you again

1744
01:59:14,710 --> 01:59:16,710
All right, let me show you don't screw this up

1745
01:59:19,479 --> 01:59:26,760
80 so the coffee with amaretto off off tape. No, I can't sell it coffee whipped cream and amaretto off the table

1746
01:59:27,829 --> 01:59:30,579
Everything else is fair game

1747
01:59:30,579 --> 01:59:32,579
mocha fair game

1748
01:59:32,579 --> 01:59:37,000
That's a good good price

1749
01:59:37,779 --> 01:59:41,239
Sell it special blend

1750
01:59:41,659 --> 01:59:48,140
Sell it that's another big take. All right whipped cream and amaretto leave them alone

1751
01:59:52,729 --> 01:59:56,090
Why do you type the number when there's a giant sell all button you can use for each item?

1752
01:59:56,329 --> 01:59:57,770
It's a very good question

1753
01:59:57,770 --> 02:00:03,529
I'll tell you the reason why I do that is so I can see the number the actual number the actual amount of money

1754
02:00:03,529 --> 02:00:06,810
I will receive because if you hit sell all it does not tell you the number

1755
02:00:07,369 --> 02:00:13,029
It's nice to kind of have a visual of how much money it's going to be worth. I like to kind of see it

1756
02:00:13,750 --> 02:00:18,739
I don't like corporate germa. Yeah, he went off corporate

1757
02:00:19,699 --> 02:00:25,050

1996
02:27:03,479 --> 02:27:21,479
This lag is pissing me off. It makes it hard to do

1997
02:27:22,040 --> 02:27:27,819
This is kind of hard to do with the lag being like this

1998
02:27:36,139 --> 02:27:41,860
Yeah, this is like annoying to do with the lag 20 cases is better than I had before

2007
02:28:24,979 --> 02:28:41,940
What do you say 25 cases for 10 grand take them? That's a lot for just chocolate with caramel

2008
02:28:42,659 --> 02:28:55,319

Or is it a coffee time? Is it time to go back?

2045
02:32:53,020 --> 02:32:58,709
I think it's time to have coffee. It's straight coffee right now. I think so

2061
02:34:27,370 --> 02:34:31,209
Splendid i'm not sure why she's so interested in our wares

02:36:10,559 --> 02:36:12,540

Silly zonka wonka. We are constantly offering official tours of the tower and I need party favors

Chocolate with raspberry we gotta get raspberries where raspberries tangiers. Okay, let's go to tangers

02:38:16,649 --> 02:38:18,569
cherries

2102
02:38:18,569 --> 02:38:20,629
blueberries

2103
02:38:20,629 --> 02:38:25,440
raspberries

2104
02:38:25,440 --> 02:38:27,440
Three weeks. You must be taking a zeppelin

2105
02:38:28,399 --> 02:38:30,399
All right, I need a hundred

2106
02:38:30,479 --> 02:38:35,309
Let's get that going and then cinnamon coffee

2107
02:38:35,950 --> 02:38:42,909
All right. We're gonna do that next

2108
02:38:42,909 --> 02:38:46,639
It's definitely cherry. I definitely need cherries. I'm gonna need them

2109
02:38:51,200 --> 02:38:54,319
It's probably it's either gonna be blueberries or cherries with a secret ingredient

2110
02:38:54,879 --> 02:39:07,399
I'm gonna get them now

2111
02:39:07,399 --> 02:39:09,399
You're rolling get them both

2112
02:39:09,479 --> 02:39:17,239
I'll get even more

2113
02:39:17,239 --> 02:39:19,239
All right. I have a shitload of cherries now

2114
02:39:22,879 --> 02:39:25,600
Uh, I need to change this coffee to cinnamon

2115
02:39:27,559 --> 02:39:30,840
And we're gonna change the chocolate as well. All right, i'm right here. Let's go change the chocolate

2116
02:39:31,079 --> 02:39:44,620
What are we doing for chocolate bars? We need raspberry chocolate bars. Let's go use that one 17 a week get the fuck out of here

2117
02:39:44,620 --> 02:39:45,899
Make that better

2118
02:39:45,899 --> 02:39:47,739
I'm gonna be laggy

2119
02:39:47,739 --> 02:39:51,770
Remember the type of guy to eat nuggets without sauce

2120
02:40:06,090 --> 02:40:07,309
I mean

2121
02:40:07,309 --> 02:40:09,469
Do you eat every single nugget with sauce?

2122
02:40:13,440 --> 02:40:26,430
I don't I would say 60% of every 70 to 60% of every nugget is dipped in sauce. Sometimes you just want a nugget

2123
02:40:27,920 --> 02:40:29,920
Not every single one has to be dipped in sauce

2124
02:40:30,159 --> 02:40:52,440
How many raspberries?

2125
02:40:52,440 --> 02:41:04,840
Cereal killer behavior. I I don't dip every single nugget into sweet and sour or something usually I do

2126
02:41:05,719 --> 02:41:07,719
And by the way, how many sauces?

2127
02:41:07,719 --> 02:41:16,250
Are we talking here? Do we do you guys do one sauce? Do you do two sauces three different sauces? How many I would say two to three?

2128
02:41:17,819 --> 02:41:19,340
Usually it's about two

2129
02:41:19,340 --> 02:41:23,360
Usually it's for me. It's if uh, if it's a like McNuggets

2130
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,299
sweet and sour sauce

2131
02:41:26,299 --> 02:41:27,500
and

2132
02:41:27,500 --> 02:41:29,500
Maybe honey mustard barbecue

2133
02:41:29,659 --> 02:41:44,600
Depends on how I feel the sweet and sour sauce from mcdonald's is the best that you can find anywhere. It's based

2134
02:41:44,680 --> 02:41:50,670
Well, no, that's yeah, of course it is

2135
02:41:50,670 --> 02:41:52,110
There it is

2136
02:41:52,110 --> 02:41:55,870
There's the whiskey. I am about to do something insane

2137
02:41:58,360 --> 02:41:59,639
Okay, so

2138
02:41:59,639 --> 02:42:03,100
We got irish coffee

2139
02:42:03,399 --> 02:42:08,250
300 i'm gonna get are you ready for this? Are you guys ready?

2140
02:42:08,809 --> 02:42:13,629
We're gonna haggle. I'm gonna I don't imagine you're doing much business with these outlandish prices

2141
02:42:14,350 --> 02:42:19,879
Again, hey, here's how this is gonna work you help me a bit on your price. I'll buy the ingredients

2142
02:42:20,600 --> 02:42:29,309
Thank you

2143
02:42:29,309 --> 02:42:36,459
400 bottles of whiskey make a custom. That's just three whiskies

2144
02:42:37,020 --> 02:42:45,049
In fact, we're gonna do 500 bottles of whiskey. I got a good deal here

2145
02:42:45,690 --> 02:42:51,879
Do I need any more of this stuff? Maybe some more cherries?

2146
02:42:57,600 --> 02:42:59,469
All right. That's it

2147
02:42:59,469 --> 02:43:02,670
22 sacks of milk. That's a good deal. I'll take

2148
02:43:03,309 --> 02:43:14,760
I'll take 500

2149
02:43:14,760 --> 02:43:26,829
Alcohol doesn't go bad. And what kind of coffee is irish coffee?

2150
02:43:29,579 --> 02:43:35,850
Alcohol just gets better with age

2151
02:43:35,850 --> 02:43:39,610
The recipe for irish coffee is 600. I need cream

2152
02:43:40,250 --> 02:43:43,850
I don't even need to look at the coffee. So I just need a little bit more cream. I need like 200 300 more cream

2153
02:43:45,319 --> 02:43:47,500
Good. All right

2154
02:43:47,500 --> 02:43:51,899
We've got this being made our quest is for 45 cases. It'll be done

2155
02:43:52,299 --> 02:43:55,100
We're gonna go down and make cinnamon coffee down in capetown right now

2156
02:44:06,219 --> 02:44:13,309
Cinnamon coffee plenty Moroccan coffee plenty of sugar plenty of cinnamon use this one. Here we go

2157
02:44:17,979 --> 02:44:19,979
Ingredients that are not alcohol will go bad

2158
02:44:20,540 --> 02:44:24,879
I'll just i'm gonna put it in like a bunch of oak barrels. I'll just put it back in the barrel

2159
02:44:38,780 --> 02:44:40,940
Oh my god, you know, I what do you think I was?

2160
02:44:45,180 --> 02:44:58,090
So annoying

2161
02:44:58,090 --> 02:45:07,340
Oh my god

2162
02:45:07,340 --> 02:45:22,200
No, i'm trying to go here. All right. These are among us kill sounds

2163
02:45:27,479 --> 02:45:29,639

2164
02:45:31,180 --> 02:45:33,180
To back to tokyo

2166
02:45:44,379 --> 02:45:47,579

2169
02:46:08,909 --> 02:46:10,590

02:46:10,590 --> 02:46:15,069
Trade these in there you are

2171
02:46:16,760 --> 02:46:20,600
It's fifty thousand dollars and a couple of fruit recipes. This is blueberry

2172
02:46:21,399 --> 02:46:23,079
And cherry. Yes

2173
02:46:23,079 --> 02:46:26,520

Like a 300 of these i'm gonna make them right now if we often host special events here at the tower

2177
02:46:42,649 --> 02:46:45,840
In fact, I could use 45 cases each

2178
02:46:46,399 --> 02:46:50,940
Of the infusion recipes I gave you that's not enough a hundred thousand

2179
02:46:51,579 --> 02:46:53,579
Make that a million 45 cases each

2180
02:47:03,399 --> 02:47:06,680
That would be almost a hundred k that's 90 cases of what she just did

Um, wait, why is it color coded? I'm so confused

2191
02:48:27,389 --> 02:48:30,250

You'll be able to reconfigure your factories without needing to travel there. That's insane

2247
02:53:54,090 --> 02:54:00,540
You can reset factories to any product they have previously produced. Believe me. This is well worth a hundred thousand dollars

2248
02:54:01,840 --> 02:54:16,120
You oh you bet. Oh my god. That's so much better. I can do this remote now

2249
02:54:16,750 --> 02:54:24,959
I don't have to fly across the world to change recipes. Perfect. Awesome. All right

2250
02:54:28,170 --> 02:54:35,549
All right, i'm gonna pee again. So we're gonna pee again. I'm gonna restart the game because it's feeling a little laggy

2251
02:54:35,549 --> 02:54:42,440
So i'm gonna save the game and quit and then restart it. So i'll be right back. We're gonna pee see in uh, like two minutes

2252
02:58:18,360 --> 02:58:33,639

2254
02:58:41,209 --> 02:58:43,610

2268
03:00:22,170 --> 03:00:29,040

2272
03:00:48,219 --> 03:00:52,600
Jesus

2273
03:00:52,600 --> 03:00:54,520

2287
03:02:25,770 --> 03:02:29,610

2359
03:11:58,399 --> 03:12:09,739
There's your nutmeg. There's your columbian cocoa. Wait, that's honey. Where's the whiskey? That's nutmeg right there. It's ground on top

2360
03:12:09,979 --> 03:12:20,879
It's nutmeg shavings nutmeg shavings a drizzle of honey

2361
03:12:22,250 --> 03:12:33,579
Whiskey infusion drizzle of honey whiskey columbian chocolate. It's a ton of nutmeg. You can never have too much nutmeg

2362
03:12:33,579 --> 03:12:41,549
Let's get this guy out of here. What are you saying? All right, this is called the uh, I don't know

2363
03:12:41,870 --> 03:12:47,129
I don't know digging for gold because it's like honey. That's like gold

2364
03:12:47,129 --> 03:13:23,340
There's whiskey which is kind of like gold nutmeg is gold digging for gold. This is fucking gross

2365
03:13:23,340 --> 03:13:26,940
This is one of this is one of the most normal yummy delicious candies

2366
03:13:26,940 --> 03:13:29,420
I've made of the four things that i've made

2367
03:13:29,420 --> 03:13:50,909
This is the one that people would actually probably eat digging for gold columbian cocoa honey nutmeg whiskey. I love it

2368
03:13:51,149 --> 03:14:01,879
So let's go back to tokyo

2369
03:14:01,879 --> 03:14:09,000
And I think I want to get this in production. Oh, right. All right, we're gonna go back to

2370
03:14:09,639 --> 03:14:14,799
I need limes to fly across the damn entire world for limes

2371
03:14:16,639 --> 03:14:20,000
Jerma, I did the dishes. Are you proud of me? Yeah, nice job

2372
03:14:21,959 --> 03:14:23,159
Wow

2373
03:14:23,159 --> 03:14:25,600
Remember how much limes were before?

2374
03:14:26,000 --> 03:14:42,079
Did the dishes? Yeah, nice

2375
03:14:42,079 --> 03:14:45,819
Back up to xeric

2376
03:14:45,819 --> 03:14:49,420
Wait a minute 60 cases chocolate peanuts for a hundred thousand dollars

2377
03:14:56,010 --> 03:14:58,729
All right. I need to dump some inventory here. I've got

2378
03:14:59,370 --> 03:15:11,000
I need lemons. I got the lemons. I'm ready to turn this over

2379
03:15:14,799 --> 03:15:16,799
the sprite sponge

2380
03:15:18,219 --> 03:15:20,459
Go for it. Use that recipe 29 a week is fine

2381
03:15:21,020 --> 03:15:24,479
Does the game sort of like this but it's lemonade

2382
03:15:26,139 --> 03:15:28,299
That's kind of cool

2383
03:15:28,299 --> 03:15:31,979
All right. So this is mocha. I don't have any I can't do any more mocha, but I needed 60 mocha

2384
03:15:31,979 --> 03:15:33,979
Did I get 60 mocha? Yes or no?

2385
03:15:34,379 --> 03:15:36,379
I do. All right, we can change this coffee

2386
03:15:38,840 --> 03:15:40,840
We're gonna change the coffee to irish coffee

2387
03:15:41,399 --> 03:15:44,489
Here you go

2388
03:15:44,489 --> 03:15:46,489
Oh, I have to go there to do it

2389
03:15:46,489 --> 03:15:49,370
Anybody want any coffee?

2390
03:15:49,370 --> 03:15:58,139
I'm ready to go back to kona with this shit

2391
03:15:58,780 --> 03:16:02,809
But I have to do this first

2392
03:16:02,809 --> 03:16:17,360
Let's start making just a absolute shit load of irish coffees. We're in sub only mode. Why?

2393
03:16:58,270 --> 03:17:00,270
Oh, I need milk. I need milk. I need milk. I need milk

2394
03:17:05,690 --> 03:17:17,049
Oh shit, it's going too fast

2395
03:17:17,049 --> 03:17:18,729
All right. That's a lot

2396
03:17:18,729 --> 03:17:20,729
That's a decent that's 35 cases a week nice

2397
03:17:28,090 --> 03:17:30,190
Only 35. That's a lot

2398
03:17:30,190 --> 03:17:32,430
And there's enough for me just to just keep this on forever

2399
03:17:33,340 --> 03:17:36,860
All right. They are making these how many of these do I own now a lot probably

2400
03:17:37,979 --> 03:17:41,680
187 who wants these who would buy these at a decent price?

2401
03:17:47,079 --> 03:17:50,250
Not here

2402
03:17:50,250 --> 03:17:54,010
All right. These are doing well. How many do I more do I need? Let's go now. Let's go to kona

2403
03:17:55,610 --> 03:18:00,440
Oh the cherries cost more than the chocolate. Yeah, that sucks

2404
03:18:01,309 --> 03:18:06,110
Oh, you manufacture at least 10 different coffee products. Nice

2405
03:18:06,670 --> 03:18:15,629
All right, here we go

2406
03:18:15,629 --> 03:18:18,670
You really know how to work wonders of my beans. Stop by and see

2407
03:18:19,389 --> 03:18:26,459
Lialoa next door. I knew this was gonna work out swimmingly

2408
03:18:26,700 --> 03:18:29,340
Trust me having an outpost here in hawaii will be great for your business

2409
03:18:29,659 --> 03:18:35,340
We see a lot of tourists, especially tourists with disposable dollars for confections. There's one last thing i'll need to you to do

2410
03:18:36,059 --> 03:18:39,979
Bring me 50 cases each of chocolate with honey arabium bold

2411
03:18:40,540 --> 03:18:45,020
And you're the cuban clock cleaner. Oh my god. That's so much

2412
03:18:50,079 --> 03:18:52,079
It sounds like you had to look down

2413
03:18:52,559 --> 03:18:56,479
i'll take a 50 cases of chocolate bars with honey arabium bold and

2414
03:18:57,690 --> 03:18:59,770
You're the cuban clock cleaner

2415
03:19:00,409 --> 03:19:05,530
God damn it. Okay, that's a lot

2416
03:19:07,600 --> 03:19:09,920
I'm just i'm gonna make irish coffees for a while. I need money

2417
03:19:12,889 --> 03:19:15,610
I have enough for this special order of peanuts

2418
03:19:18,200 --> 03:19:20,200
Oh, okay. We got to go to begota

2419
03:19:20,600 --> 03:19:24,590
And we're gonna start doing infusion stuff for japan. All right, let's go to begota

2420
03:19:25,229 --> 03:19:38,090
Here you go

2421
03:19:38,090 --> 03:19:41,690
I take it your sprite sponge products are earning a healthy profit. No, not at all actually

2422
03:19:42,329 --> 03:19:49,950
Excellent. They are even better than I had led to believe

2423
03:19:50,430 --> 03:19:57,770
Here's a recipe I mentioned for refreshing dark columbian cocoa lime infusions. Nice. Okay

2424
03:20:00,440 --> 03:20:12,520
My infusions are way better though. Can you bring me 45 cases? I'll give you a second one. You guys like cherries

2425
03:20:18,479 --> 03:20:22,030
No

2426
03:20:22,030 --> 03:20:24,030
Why does nobody want these?

2427
03:20:30,959 --> 03:20:33,520
My god, I got 200 200 i'm all right for now

2428
03:20:35,979 --> 03:20:38,409
There is a bad for you

2429
03:20:38,409 --> 03:20:40,409
There is a bad and you should feel bad

2430
03:20:40,409 --> 03:20:48,350
What's wrong with you today?

2431
03:20:48,350 --> 03:20:50,350
Okay, I have to do

2432
03:20:52,399 --> 03:20:56,040
This order is absurd

2433
03:20:58,829 --> 03:21:00,829
Chocolate bars with peanuts

2434
03:21:02,299 --> 03:21:04,299
I need peanuts. Where can I get peanuts?

2435
03:21:10,889 --> 03:21:22,219
capetown

2436
03:21:22,219 --> 03:21:27,659
You like cherries

2437
03:21:27,659 --> 03:21:32,909
Fuck. All right. Give me the peanuts

2438
03:21:35,049 --> 03:21:37,209
Here's how this works. Give me help me out a bit. Fine

2439
03:21:37,850 --> 03:21:42,780
You need you wanted a lot of these right? Let's just get let's just have let's get 200

2440
03:21:44,959 --> 03:21:47,360
All right, turn this off. We're gonna be making

2441
03:21:48,079 --> 03:21:50,079
Chocolate peanuts. Thank you

2442
03:21:50,399 --> 03:21:54,559
Only 18 a week. Holy shit. That's horrible. It's 60 cases

2443
03:21:58,750 --> 03:22:01,870
All right, is it time these cherries? Why don't nobody like them?

2444
03:22:03,149 --> 03:22:05,149
I'm missing like this is such a horrible loss

2445
03:22:05,629 --> 03:22:10,520
They keep making irish coffees. They're probably worth a shitload

2446
03:22:12,879 --> 03:22:13,840
They are

2447
03:22:13,840 --> 03:22:14,879
Okay

2448
03:22:14,879 --> 03:22:29,389
Just keep making them. I am gonna go I have to sell i'm going here irish coffee only

2449
03:22:30,010 --> 03:22:31,870
2,000

2450
03:22:31,870 --> 03:22:34,360
cinnamon

2451
03:22:34,360 --> 03:22:37,260
Are you kidding me?

2452
03:22:37,260 --> 03:22:41,500
Cinnamon coffee is worth more than an irish coffee irish coffee has whiskey in it

2453
03:22:53,799 --> 03:22:55,399
Is this spices?

2454
03:22:55,399 --> 03:23:06,350
But joe make sure I don't need any of this stuff. I need okay. I need arabian bold

2455
03:23:08,239 --> 03:23:10,239
Okay. No, I don't need any of this shit

2456
03:23:10,319 --> 03:23:13,899
Get rid of the cup of joe

2457
03:23:13,899 --> 03:23:16,540
Take some money back here mocha don't need any mocha

2458
03:23:17,790 --> 03:23:19,790
irish coffee really

2459
03:23:21,440 --> 03:23:22,559
That's it

2460
03:23:22,559 --> 03:23:30,000
I mean, that's a uh, that's almost half a million dollars, but I feel like I was gonna get more than that

2461
03:23:36,079 --> 03:23:39,120
Hmm

2462
03:23:39,120 --> 03:23:42,239
He's not so he's still not using the sell all button. I know I told you why

2463
03:23:44,239 --> 03:23:47,440
Look if I hover over sell all it doesn't say how much I get

2464
03:23:48,079 --> 03:23:50,059
I just do it

2465
03:23:50,059 --> 03:23:54,059
Putting in the maximum that I can do or putting a price it shows you and I'd like to see it

2466
03:23:57,049 --> 03:24:00,250
Uh, i'm gonna hold it for now. No, i'm not get rid of all of it

2467
03:24:03,709 --> 03:24:05,709
That price is just gonna drop. It probably will

2468
03:24:07,530 --> 03:24:09,209
Uh, I need

2469
03:24:09,209 --> 03:24:13,049
All right. We're gonna I gotta change this

2470
03:24:13,049 --> 03:24:18,329
Special order. Yeah, the peanuts order is coming

2471
03:24:18,969 --> 03:24:22,219
50 cases milk chocolate infusion with allspice

2472
03:24:23,840 --> 03:24:25,840
Milk chocolate infusion with allspice

2473
03:24:26,479 --> 03:24:31,399
I have the necessary ingredients

2474
03:24:31,479 --> 03:24:35,479
But I cannot do it because I have to make it and oh, I hate that thing. I gotta go back to japan

2475
03:24:36,540 --> 03:24:38,219
All right back to japan

2476
03:24:38,219 --> 03:24:49,200
We're making some new confections

2477
03:24:49,200 --> 03:24:51,360
I mean do I hold on to these nobody wants them?

2478
03:24:52,700 --> 03:24:56,780
That's such a low price. It's a thousand bucks. It's like 1300 bucks for cherries

2479
03:24:57,659 --> 03:25:04,329
Can I just take a loss here?

2480
03:25:04,329 --> 03:25:10,879
I'm sure I just hold it

2481
03:25:10,879 --> 03:25:12,879
All right, the rest of this junk we're getting rid of

2482
03:25:19,950 --> 03:25:21,950
No more sprite sponges

2483
03:25:22,030 --> 03:25:26,250
Peanuts we need do we need caramel? We don't think I don't think we need raspberry anymore either

2484
03:25:26,889 --> 03:25:36,250
I have the peanuts chocolate caramel. I don't think I need these either

2485
03:25:41,049 --> 03:25:43,450
I need to make new infusions though. All right new infusion

2486
03:25:44,719 --> 03:25:48,879
What do I want to do?

2487
03:25:48,879 --> 03:25:50,639
This is the one with allspice

2488
03:25:50,639 --> 03:25:54,569
Let's do this one. All right. I'm gonna try to do this right

2489
03:25:56,920 --> 03:25:59,399
All right blue blue is gonna be over here red will be here

2490
03:26:00,379 --> 03:26:03,370
We'll have two red

2491
03:26:03,370 --> 03:26:05,930
And then it's um milk over here

2492
03:26:07,049 --> 03:26:11,979
um

2493
03:26:11,979 --> 03:26:15,280
um

2494
03:26:15,280 --> 03:26:16,079
um

2495
03:26:16,079 --> 03:26:20,350
Whatever. Oh shit, this sucks

2496
03:26:29,930 --> 03:26:46,270
um oops

2497
03:26:46,270 --> 03:27:04,440
What do I need milk? What the fuck 35 cases? I thought I was doing bad

2498
03:27:05,549 --> 03:27:15,610
All right. It's really important just to do that. Okay, you sell cream. No

2499
03:27:19,180 --> 03:27:21,450
Oh, that's what happened

2500
03:27:21,450 --> 03:27:25,850
I bought the cherries at the most expensive they ever were in the course of the game. They're

2501
03:27:26,389 --> 03:27:28,389
474 dollars now they were

2502
03:27:28,389 --> 03:27:30,649
1300 like a month ago in game

2503
03:27:34,010 --> 03:27:38,250
Well, then i'm just gonna i'm gonna the price is probably just gonna keep going down. Just sell them all sell them all

2504
03:27:39,129 --> 03:27:41,690
The price is gonna keep going down get rid of them. I don't even want them

2505
03:27:46,559 --> 03:27:48,399
Raid song. I don't see raid

2506
03:27:48,399 --> 03:27:56,139
I need 50

2507
03:27:56,139 --> 03:27:59,069
I'll have that in a little bit

2508
03:27:59,069 --> 03:28:01,069
The special order will be done soon, too

2509
03:28:02,559 --> 03:28:04,559
All right, we're gonna start working on this arabian bold

2510
03:28:10,000 --> 03:28:12,399
I need kona. Oh, I need all I need coffee

2511
03:28:13,120 --> 03:28:14,879
I need coffee now

2512
03:28:14,879 --> 03:28:18,379
We need moroccan coffee. We need kona coffee a shitload of it

2513
03:28:19,979 --> 03:28:30,200
Go I managed to get a hold of 100 sacks each of cayenne pepper and anise

2514
03:28:30,989 --> 03:28:34,670
And it just so happened to have on hand an infusion recipe that uses these spices

2515
03:28:35,370 --> 03:28:37,850
If I gave you the recipe as well as the ingredients right now

2516
03:28:38,170 --> 03:28:52,489
Would you be willing to deliver your first 75 cases of the product to me? Sure. Okay

2517
03:28:54,319 --> 03:28:58,799
Ooh, that looks good. That's like that's what I wanted to make

2518
03:28:59,440 --> 03:29:02,250
That's a really good like sith candy

2750
03:59:36,930 --> 03:59:55,540
Okay, i'm gonna make these first because I want to get this out of my inventory

2754
04:01:14,899 --> 04:01:21,250
I'm sure you're aware of how high travel costs have gotten bad news is that this trend is likely to continue

2755
04:01:21,969 --> 04:01:24,690
The good news is that I am here to offer you a corporate airline

2756
04:01:25,489 --> 04:01:28,209
For an investment of five hundred thousand dollars

2757
04:01:28,530 --> 04:01:34,610
You'll be able to fly direct from any port to any port and all of your future travel costs will be zero

2758
04:01:34,850 --> 04:01:37,899
This certainly makes a difference as you fly in and out of secret ports

2759
04:01:38,540 --> 04:01:41,500
And this is not even considering the bump to your style and grace. What do you say?

It's like two or three thousand dollars a trip

2763
04:01:54,500 --> 04:01:58,909

2840
04:10:26,959 --> 04:10:28,959
There are slot machines in the game

2841
04:10:29,760 --> 04:10:31,760
I didn't like code that into the game

2842
04:10:32,399 --> 04:10:37,200
Just like pick the box for five hundred thousand dollars. Like I didn't turn it into that. They put it in twice

04:10:44,860 --> 04:10:48,379

04:24:40,750 --> 04:24:46,729
Holy fuck. That's a lot. It's an investment. This is this is all an investment. Okay

2955
04:24:47,290 --> 04:24:58,600
What about the pecans? Shit, whatever. I'll get it. I heard a new rumor that

2959
04:25:23,399 --> 04:25:28,540
What do I get pecans?

2960
04:25:28,540 --> 04:25:32,590
In begota. Was that just in begota? Oh fuck whatever

2961
04:25:34,280 --> 04:25:37,799
I'm so thrilled your milk chocolate infusion with blueberry delicious. I was indeed able to put you here

2962
04:25:37,799 --> 04:25:41,420
It is there's a recipe for it dark chocolate infusion with ginger

2963
04:25:41,979 --> 04:25:51,959
Ooh, nice

2964
04:25:51,959 --> 04:25:54,159
cloves

2965
04:25:54,159 --> 04:25:59,840
Agle, holy shit. Look at these people. Holy shit. You knew I was coming. You knew I was coming

2966
04:26:00,809 --> 04:26:03,129
I god damn it. I was here

2967
04:26:03,770 --> 04:26:05,770
I was on the phone with my agent

2968
04:26:06,350 --> 04:26:12,190
I'm like, I gotta buy 5 000 things at pecans. Where do I get them? I'll pay any price. I don't care what it is

2969
04:26:14,350 --> 04:26:17,309
I left he had a week to get ready and then I came back

2970
04:26:17,950 --> 04:26:22,440
Holy shit

2971
04:26:22,440 --> 04:26:24,440
That's absolutely

2972
04:26:24,500 --> 04:26:25,959
absurd

2973
04:26:25,959 --> 04:26:28,600
Truly fucking absurd that i'm gonna pay this but i'm gonna do it

2974
04:26:29,879 --> 04:26:33,959
Because that means that these all right hear me out. That means that this shit is worth a ton of money

2975
04:26:35,610 --> 04:26:38,809
That means that right now pecans are anything with pecans

2976
04:26:39,610 --> 04:26:41,930
Are going to be worth insane amounts of money

2977
04:26:43,420 --> 04:26:45,260
I'm gonna make a ton

2978
04:26:45,260 --> 04:26:51,579
Of those pecan chocolate infusions, but you hear my voice crack. I just broke because I just did a million dollar dump. Okay

2979
04:26:52,139 --> 04:26:54,299
My lot is that's how it's not how it works. What do you mean?

2980
04:26:55,600 --> 04:26:57,600
That's not that's not how it works in the game. What do you mean?

2981
04:27:01,020 --> 04:27:20,920
What do you mean? Why are you saying that? What are you talking about? What do you mean? Buy high sell low just wait

2982
04:27:21,559 --> 04:27:28,079
Hold on a second. Go back here

2983
04:27:29,040 --> 04:27:34,559
Holy shit, that guy was a fucking idiot. He just he just gave me a million dollars for like a hundred pecans

2984
04:27:35,280 --> 04:27:40,319
This guy didn't we got from failed every economics class. He ever took in college. What a fucking moron

2985
04:27:41,610 --> 04:27:42,729
You've done it

2986
04:27:42,729 --> 04:27:45,340
You've earned my endorsement

2987
04:27:45,340 --> 04:27:48,780
By showing me your ability to accumulate recipes for infusions way to go

2988
04:27:49,340 --> 04:27:53,340
There's still plenty of work to be done, but you are making excellent progress. I have no doubt you're going to succeed

2989
04:27:56,350 --> 04:28:01,290
These are currently worth so much money use this recipe. Let's go. I'm gonna try to get a huge amount

2990
04:28:01,850 --> 04:28:05,049
I thought you went to harvard if you were born in boston

2991
04:28:06,590 --> 04:28:11,069
No, not everybody born in boston goes to harvard. It's just a thing that people say that are from boston

2992
04:28:11,069 --> 04:28:13,069
So you think that they're smarter than they actually are?

2993
04:28:15,209 --> 04:28:21,920
Yeah, we got harvard here. You didn't go there. Yes. Well, I know but it's here. I mean we're all intelligent here

2994
04:28:22,479 --> 04:28:31,629
That's not what it means. You didn't go to harvard

04:45:37,279 --> 04:45:46,169
21 is fine. I don't care

3167
04:45:46,169 --> 04:45:51,290
You wanted the first batch?

3168
04:45:51,450 --> 04:45:58,729
Here are the handful of truffle truffle reference whatever i'm trying to even say I don't even care cool bowser bowser treat

3169
04:45:59,049 --> 04:46:00,409
Bowser treat

3170
04:46:00,409 --> 04:46:02,409
I thought that was raw meat for a second

3171
04:46:06,430 --> 04:46:09,630
Uh, here's the deal each of the other members of the board of directors some of whom you've met

3172
04:46:10,669 --> 04:46:13,310
Some of whom you haven't is holding a truffle recipe for you

3173
04:46:15,799 --> 04:46:19,159
We need to present each member with a case of truffles to exchange to their recipe

3174
04:46:19,720 --> 04:46:26,110
The tricky part is you need to figure out which recipe goes with which board member. Oh boy

3175
04:46:29,040 --> 04:46:34,319
Each of the ingredients you will need to make each of the five truffle recipes are at a market somewhere

3176
04:46:35,200 --> 04:46:37,200
What the hell are you trying to tell me to do?

3177
04:46:40,400 --> 04:46:44,159
Travel to toronto and wellington now where you'll meet the remaining members of the board

3178
04:46:47,000 --> 04:46:50,439
Each board member will yell you know and give you you know around but how do I know what they like?

3179
04:46:56,650 --> 04:46:59,689
When you show up with the correct type of truffle in your inventory

3180
04:47:00,409 --> 04:47:04,750
Whatever go to hell

3181
04:47:04,830 --> 04:47:10,439
How many do I have 21?

3182
04:47:10,520 --> 04:47:18,080
But for now I got to do the lime

3183

04:47:51,279 --> 04:47:53,279
Thank you. It's like three hundred thousand dollars

3189
04:47:53,840 --> 04:47:58,380
That's that done

3190
04:47:58,380 --> 04:48:00,380
I need to get 11 truffle recipes

3191
04:48:04,779 --> 04:48:07,180
40 cases of mango clove infusions

3192
04:48:09,229 --> 04:48:11,229

3193
04:48:12,970 --> 04:48:14,840

3195
04:48:16,360 --> 04:48:24,590
Who sells mangoes?

3196
04:48:24,590 --> 04:48:29,150
I don't know 100 million if you do the truffle shuffle

3197
04:48:29,709 --> 04:48:40,009
I'm not gonna do the truffle shuffle. Sorry

3198
04:48:40,409 --> 04:48:42,590
I have 100 strawberries. All right

3199
04:48:42,909 --> 04:48:46,909
back to tokyo

3200
04:48:46,909 --> 04:49:02,000
No, I need to have some type of chocolate production going here. All right, i'm gonna do raspberries

3201
04:49:04,090 --> 04:49:09,520
There are raspberries here. They're not raspberries here. What the hell even is here?

3202
04:49:10,159 --> 04:49:11,599
pumpkin chocolate

3203
04:49:11,599 --> 04:49:14,669
Hazelnut i'm gonna do hazelnut chocolate. Let's just buy a shitload of this

3204
04:49:15,389 --> 04:49:23,689
Yeah, just use this one

3205
04:49:23,689 --> 04:49:27,209
And that's a horrible are you kidding me do I really have to travel back there to make that better?

3206
04:49:27,610 --> 04:49:42,619
I was thinking about it. I was all right toronto

3207
04:49:47,369 --> 04:49:51,520
big town market

3208
04:49:51,520 --> 04:49:54,240
Nothing really here

3209
04:49:54,240 --> 04:49:56,509
waterfront sweets

3210
04:49:56,509 --> 04:49:59,389
It's true. Indeed. I'm holding onto a truffle recipe for you

3211
04:49:59,709 --> 04:50:04,430
And it's also true. I'm looking for you to have a particular truffle on hand before i'm willing to hand it over

3212
04:50:05,500 --> 04:50:13,560
Okay, these are still worth a lot

3213
04:50:15,709 --> 04:50:17,709
Breakfast blend. All right. I gotta

3214
04:50:18,619 --> 04:50:20,619
I gotta say I gotta go to breakfast blend

3215
04:50:20,860 --> 04:50:24,700

04:50:26,029 --> 04:50:28,029
I gotta dump a bunch of stuff. I have to sell

3217
04:50:28,909 --> 04:50:30,939

Yeah time to sell a huge bunches time to dump

3219
04:50:41,849 --> 04:50:43,549
Oh

3220
04:50:43,549 --> 04:50:46,830
As long as you're using an ingredient at one of the factories it will not expire

3221
04:50:48,439 --> 04:50:53,400
After a number of weeks of not using it. However, the ingredient will expire. Okay, that makes sense

3222
04:51:02,279 --> 04:51:04,680
I need to go sell

3223
04:51:04,680 --> 04:51:06,680

Perhaps you've heard of us

3231
04:51:35,279 --> 04:51:37,520
I understand you're making a good name for yourself with this business

3232
04:51:37,520 --> 04:51:42,970
But in terms of alex and her personal problems, why are you poking your nose into business that's got nothing to do with you?

3233
04:51:47,639 --> 04:52:03,099

3248
04:53:09,229 --> 04:53:10,830

3249
04:53:10,830 --> 04:53:22,970
Hurry. Hurry. Hurry, go. Go. Go. Go

3250
04:53:22,970 --> 04:53:24,090
Come on, give me something

3251

3254
04:55:31,740 --> 04:55:41,959
Are there hot dogs? Because this game sucks. I'm sorry. I don't know what's wrong with me tonight.

3255
04:55:41,959 --> 04:55:45,409
I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm just like in a weird mood.

3256
04:55:45,409 --> 04:56:04,279
I've been in a weird mood all day, haven't I? I want sugar. Gotta get to five million dollars.

3257
04:56:04,639 --> 04:56:10,610
Is your hazelnut? Is your hazelnut chocolate? That's good. I can produce money forever.

3258
04:56:11,049 --> 04:56:18,020
I'm gonna keep my breakfast blend up. This, however, needs to change.

3259
04:56:22,599 --> 04:56:46,069
Ginger. Let's go to Tokyo. Yeah, how about we discuss a reasonable price? Fine. Let's just produce some...

3260
04:56:46,729 --> 04:57:01,619
I've got a recipe for you. All right. This is dark chocolate with ginger. Let's do it. What happened to digging for gold?

3261
04:57:02,790 --> 04:57:34,650
I think it just sucked. I didn't get a chance to make it. Oh, for the love of God. What a shitty RNG again.

3262
04:57:35,290 --> 04:57:44,750
Terrible RNG. Just awful. Really awful. It's truly terrible RNG. Like, what a disaster.

3263
04:57:45,229 --> 04:58:45,360
Let's do it again. Much better. Much better RNG. So much better! Oh, it's like the God run.

3264
04:58:45,360 --> 04:58:59,200
Come on. Something, something. Please, please, please. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

3265
04:59:00,240 --> 04:59:11,880
All right. 40 cases a week. That's good. Let's get a shitload of ginger. That'll produce for a long time.

3266
04:59:13,740 --> 04:59:15,740
They are worth a lot. So that's good.

3267
04:59:16,299 --> 04:59:24,650
Breakfast blend is still just cranking out at 37 per week. Hazelnut chocolate bar. Look at all these white truffles.

3268
04:59:29,340 --> 04:59:35,119
I can just sell them. All right. So here's the plan. We're gonna go get more Bolognese and Colombian coffee.

3269
04:59:42,970 --> 04:59:49,279
Finally found the mangoes.

3270
04:59:49,279 --> 04:59:51,279
There they are. Finally.

3271
04:59:51,439 --> 04:59:54,759
What was it? Mango what? Mango clove.

3272
04:59:57,450 --> 05:00:01,450
Have 100 clove. Let's get a bunch of cloves. Let's do it. Let's buy it. Let's make a ton of these.

3273
05:00:02,169 --> 05:00:04,169
I'm gonna get 500 cloves, 500 mangoes.

3274
05:00:04,729 --> 05:00:21,930
Can you do something for me with these prices? God damn it. We're gonna make a shitload of those.

3275
05:00:22,490 --> 05:00:27,040
So mango clove infusion.

3276
05:00:30,169 --> 05:00:32,169
I'm just gonna make a ton.

3277
05:00:33,020 --> 05:00:35,819
Oh, these are going. They'll be going for a little while. We can sell the hell out of them.

3278
05:00:36,669 --> 05:00:38,830
I feel like Jerm is streaming this game to himself.

3279
05:00:41,840 --> 05:00:46,400
I mean, I'm just trying to play the game. I'm trying to make money here.

3280
05:00:47,770 --> 05:00:51,150
I'm streaming.

3281
05:00:51,150 --> 05:00:55,310
I'm just like talking. I'm not even streaming. I'm just like, okay, so we're gonna go over this way.

3282
05:00:56,029 --> 05:01:01,950
He read chat for once. Yeah, I'm making big fucking bucks about two million dollars. I'm up to two mil.

3283
05:01:08,040 --> 05:01:10,040
Chats are sitting here doing Jupiters.

3284
05:01:13,790 --> 05:01:18,189
Yeah, well chat's just sitting there doing Jupiters. I'm making big money.

3285
05:01:18,909 --> 05:01:22,889
I got almost 200 breakfast blends. Are you kidding me?

3286
05:01:30,810 --> 05:01:33,369
Now we're gonna go get uh, Colombian coffee.

3287
05:01:35,450 --> 05:01:43,950
To Bogota we go. Honestly, it's been five hours. I feel like I've been sitting here for 10 minutes.

3288
05:01:44,509 --> 05:01:56,860
This is his new favorite game.

3289
05:01:56,860 --> 05:02:02,889
It's a new yeah, a new mango. All right, let's keep that going. I'm gonna go to sell

3290
05:02:04,279 --> 05:02:06,200
in Kona.

3291
05:02:06,200 --> 05:02:08,430
It's over here.

3292
05:02:08,430 --> 05:02:12,029
This is my new favorite game. This is like my new favorite. It is

3293
05:02:13,340 --> 05:02:14,299
close.

3294
05:02:14,299 --> 05:02:17,500
All right, check this shit out.

3295
05:02:17,500 --> 05:02:21,740
Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. You guys ready to cross at least the three million mark?

3296
05:02:22,380 --> 05:02:28,810
Here it comes.

3297
05:02:28,810 --> 05:02:32,729
Look at this breakfast blend. Dark chocolate infusion with ginger.

3298
05:02:33,290 --> 05:02:42,560
Let's cross three million. What do you say?

3299
05:02:42,799 --> 05:02:44,799
Don't sell this here. The coffee shop guy has a better price.

3300
05:02:56,669 --> 05:02:58,669
Yeah, coffee shop guy has a much better price.

3301
05:03:03,680 --> 05:03:06,799
Whatever. I just messed up. I was gonna do 200, but I did 320. Don't care.

3302
05:03:07,119 --> 05:03:17,610
The rain streamer is panic selling all of his stocks. I want to go change the recipe to this.

3303
05:03:17,689 --> 05:03:25,310
So we have to go to Tokyo. First we're gonna take a stop in Cape Town. No, why am I going to Cape Town?

3304
05:03:25,630 --> 05:03:31,279
Where are the new recipes coming from? I don't know. I didn't want to go here.

3305
05:03:32,439 --> 05:03:43,209
Messed up.

3306
05:03:43,209 --> 05:03:45,209
Over three million dollars.

3307
05:03:45,450 --> 05:03:51,709
Today was supposed to be a fun connect stream, not some shitty chocolate game I'd find on my grandma's PC. Band that person.

3308
05:03:52,569 --> 05:04:06,220
Or at least an hour.

3309
05:04:06,220 --> 05:04:08,220
No, you know what? We'll dial it back to

3310
05:04:08,939 --> 05:04:12,619
20 minutes. You have to face the truth.

3311
05:04:16,959 --> 05:04:18,959
What?

3312
05:04:19,599 --> 05:04:23,680
I'd like the chocolate money making simulator.

3313
05:04:27,979 --> 05:04:30,540
If I'm playing connect tomorrow, it's okay. Look.

3314
05:04:31,259 --> 05:04:32,939
This is not okay.

3315
05:04:32,939 --> 05:04:39,500
I didn't say guys today we're gonna play chocolatier again. Oh, and by the way, I've burnt the connect.

3316
05:04:39,900 --> 05:04:45,180
I put it into a giant fucking steel trash can along with all the connect games and I light them on fire.

3317
05:04:46,810 --> 05:04:51,610
I smashed it. I stomped on it like grapes and I made fucking connect wine. That didn't happen.

3318
05:04:52,799 --> 05:04:54,799
It's right behind me. We're doing it tomorrow.

3319
05:04:58,330 --> 05:05:00,880
But now

3320
05:05:00,880 --> 05:05:01,759
I'm

3321
05:05:01,759 --> 05:05:04,479
enjoying making chocolates and getting five million dollars.

3322
05:05:05,599 --> 05:05:10,880
So here's what happens. Once I get to five million dollars, I'm going to go gamble until I get to 10 million or turn the stream off.

3323
05:05:11,279 --> 05:05:23,500
That's what's gonna happen. I'm gonna save it first because I like this game. It's kind of fun.

3324
05:05:26,009 --> 05:05:34,650
So now we gotta we gotta do the- what are you doing Otto? Almost running out of breakfast blend. Let's take it. We'll go to Tokyo.

3325
05:05:37,450 --> 05:05:39,950
Yeah, I want to do the mango.

3326
05:05:40,029 --> 05:05:44,750
Oh, nice Otto. I want to sneeze. I'm not about to sneeze.

3327
05:05:45,310 --> 05:06:18,779
Here we go. This is gonna be a big big money maker I got. I'm gonna make 500 of these. I need snowballs.

3328
05:06:19,259 --> 05:06:45,560
They're trying to make it harder on me. They're trying to make it harder.

3329
05:06:52,400 --> 05:07:09,979
Shit. Okay. Come on. Get me higher than 50 cases. I just need the cases.

3330
05:07:11,680 --> 05:07:23,150
51 cases. Bingo. There we are. 51 cases. Time to go

3331
05:07:23,790 --> 05:07:33,770
turn this in to Tangiers. Breakfast blend.

3332
05:07:34,330 --> 05:07:39,290
Come on, give me five million.

3333
05:07:39,290 --> 05:07:42,970
You silly zonkawonka. You're a gifted chocolatier. Here's the recipe I mentioned.

3334
05:07:42,970 --> 05:07:45,930
It may be a while before you can get a hold of all these specialty Cocos, but it'll be worth it.

3335
05:07:47,479 --> 05:07:50,360
Ooh blended cocoa dark chocolate infusion.

3336
05:07:51,000 --> 05:08:04,810
I'm not- I don't- where's Peruvian cocoa? Oh need more Moroccan coffee. No, we don't.

3337
05:08:05,450 --> 05:08:15,799
I need Bolognese and Colombian. Bolognese and Colombian. Okay, Bolognese coffee. I need hazelnuts.

3338
05:08:21,340 --> 05:08:23,979
Fuck, that wasn't a hazelnut. That was a nutmeg.

3339
05:08:28,939 --> 05:08:30,939
That's a lot.

3340
05:08:31,580 --> 05:08:33,979
Can we make a nutmeg chocolate by any chance?

3341
05:08:34,619 --> 05:08:50,349
Oh, thank god digging for gold is nutmeg. I need hazelnuts.

3342
05:08:50,909 --> 05:09:00,169
All right, Bolognese coffee, Colombian coffee.

3343
05:09:00,810 --> 05:09:07,520
Go.

3344
05:09:07,520 --> 05:09:09,919
Uh, give me better deal where I'm getting out. No.

3345
05:09:10,880 --> 05:09:32,279
God damn it. I need it. I have to do it. I- it's- I'm gonna- I'll make it back. I need it.

3346
05:09:32,759 --> 05:09:46,540
We need Colombian coffee. You got owned. I did.

3347
05:09:47,099 --> 05:09:57,689
Okay, maybe he won't be mad at me anymore if I go back there. Let's see.

3348
05:09:59,930 --> 05:10:02,409
Can you haggle somebody until they give up on their business?

3349
05:10:03,209 --> 05:10:05,369
Oh fuck, let's go to Wellington. I haven't even been here yet.

3350
05:10:05,930 --> 05:10:15,099
I didn't even give up on their business. You're doing swell silly zonkawonka and I very much look forward to working with you soon to launch our exotics.

3351
05:10:18,840 --> 05:10:20,040
God.

3352
05:10:20,040 --> 05:10:25,549
What do you mean launch your exotics?

3353
05:10:30,759 --> 05:10:33,159
Past the whiskey. It's all- wait, it went bad.

3354
05:10:35,680 --> 05:10:37,680
I had 500 whiskey and it went bad.

3355
05:10:40,169 --> 05:10:42,169
I bought these for like

3356
05:10:43,189 --> 05:10:47,220
$200,000.

3357
05:10:48,669 --> 05:10:55,500
I'm very bad at this, but it's still fun. It doesn't matter. I'm just losing money.

3358
05:10:56,139 --> 05:10:58,299
Hand over fist. Whatever that saying is.

3359
05:11:02,970 --> 05:11:04,729
Should've done some good success.

3360
05:11:04,729 --> 05:11:16,479
What else do I have to do here?

3361
05:11:16,479 --> 05:11:17,599
All right, here we go.

3362
05:11:17,599 --> 05:11:23,840
I'm going all the way back to flying across the whole world. You seem to be in a big hurry.

3363
05:11:24,400 --> 05:11:36,360
Three million, four million. Let's go.

3364
05:11:38,240 --> 05:11:40,619
Come on.

3365
05:11:40,619 --> 05:11:46,959
Four million coming on. There's so many truffles.

3366
05:11:48,270 --> 05:11:50,270
That's four million. I'm- we're almost there.

3367
05:11:51,310 --> 05:11:53,310
Somebody tell you the casino guy looks like you.

3368
05:11:53,630 --> 05:12:31,770
The raid? Did I sell everything? Was there a raid? It was. From the gray fruit.

3369
05:12:33,419 --> 05:12:39,520
Hey, I got- I got plenty of gray fruits on me right now. Thanks for the raid, dude. Take a look. Wait, that's not gray.

3370
05:12:39,520 --> 05:12:46,990
That's- do I have a gray fruit? I thought I had a gray fruit. Well, this one's kind of gray. Thanks for the raid.

3371
05:12:48,639 --> 05:12:50,860
Welcome everybody.

3372
05:12:50,860 --> 05:12:55,099
We are getting, uh, to- we're trying to get to five million dollars in the chocolate game.

3373
05:12:56,779 --> 05:13:00,540
And in the chocolate game, when you get to five million dollars, you go to the casino and you spend it so you get to 10,

3374
05:13:00,540 --> 05:13:08,299
or you turn the stream off. That's what's gonna happen. You're losing your vision? That's gray right there.

3375
05:13:10,080 --> 05:13:20,060
I didn't say the whole fruit was gray. That's- this is gray. Right there is gray. That's not green. What are you talking about?

3376
05:13:22,520 --> 05:13:23,639
This is

3377
05:13:23,639 --> 05:13:25,639
orange, like a red orange

3378
05:13:26,279 --> 05:13:28,360
into a peach color into gray.

3379
05:13:33,080 --> 05:13:43,869
Are you- is your computer screen okay? That's not green. That's not- that's gray. That's like a- that's like- what are you talking about?

3380
05:13:47,900 --> 05:13:52,779
That's not green. Are you- okay. That's green. That's gray.

3381
05:13:53,880 --> 05:14:00,200
This is green. That's gray. This is green. That's gray. How is this- how is what- where my cursor is right now?

3382
05:14:01,209 --> 05:14:08,139
How is it green? That's not green? You guys have liars. You're just fucking with me.

3383
05:14:08,380 --> 05:14:16,360
All right, what was I even doing? Oh, right, right, right, right, right. Getting to- getting to five million dollars.

3384
05:14:16,599 --> 05:14:27,979
What- okay, I need to- truffles, truffles, truffles, truffles, truffles, truffles, truffles, truffles. Here we are.

3385
05:14:28,060 --> 05:14:36,040
All right, I want to make the Bowser one. Spicy current truffles. I'm going to currents cayenne peppers.

3386
05:14:36,279 --> 05:14:48,459
I'm going to go to Wellington. Wellington, we're going to do this. Screen cap it and eyedrop tool and paint it.

3387
05:14:48,459 --> 05:14:53,099
Look at the RGB value. One of you will do it and then I- I'm gladly- we'll show it on stream.

3388
05:14:56,250 --> 05:15:21,040
What are you crazy? Okay, is that what I needed? Two hundred, two hundred,

3389
05:15:21,659 --> 05:15:28,169
six thousand, six thousand, seven hundred. All right, I need a button. I'm gonna get five hundred, five hundred, five hundred.

3390
05:15:32,779 --> 05:15:44,779
Let's go for- how many do I have? Come on, one more. This- this is gonna be the big ticket. Now I need powder.

3391
05:15:44,860 --> 05:15:55,479
It's hex zero, zero. Put your money where your mouth is. Let's be a hundred million that it's green according to an RGB value.

3392
05:15:56,490 --> 05:16:01,790
But here's the thing though. What if it is green on the RGB scale, but it's like a gray green?

3393
05:16:03,310 --> 05:16:07,919
Take- the RGB is

3394
05:16:08,000 --> 05:16:09,279
has- is hash.

3395
05:16:09,279 --> 05:16:18,119
Hold on. Green is- that's still green. But wait, wait, hold on. But if it's- if it's green-

3396
05:16:19,200 --> 05:16:21,200
But if it's gray too, then why am I wrong?

3397
05:16:21,740 --> 05:16:25,580
How come you get to be right if it's green in there, but I get to be wrong if there's gray in there?

3398
05:16:25,900 --> 05:16:31,689
That's not fair.

3399
05:16:31,689 --> 05:16:33,130
Because it's green.

3400
05:16:33,130 --> 05:16:38,680
Why can't it be- I can't be both color? It's green. It's gray. Life isn't fair.

3401
05:16:40,939 --> 05:16:48,279
You said it was gray. Show it to me. Give me the RGB value. I want to see it. Gray isn't a color, buddy. Oh, sorry.

3402
05:16:51,229 --> 05:16:53,950
Sorry. Gray is not a color, I guess.

3403
05:16:56,000 --> 05:17:05,599
It's- what is it? Five five something? Give me one sec. I'm all tapping for this.

3404
05:17:09,439 --> 05:17:10,799
It is

3405
05:17:10,799 --> 05:17:15,080
hash five five?

3406
05:17:15,080 --> 05:17:22,750
Oh, do me again? Turning links on. Does anybody have it? Five e-

3407
05:17:25,069 --> 05:17:40,220
Five e five seven three d. Is that a lie? Is that the right one? Five e five seven three d. Bullshit. That's not even right.

3408
05:17:40,459 --> 05:17:47,709
That's not even correct.

3409
05:17:47,709 --> 05:17:52,380
That's a troll color. You're fucking with me.

3410
05:17:53,369 --> 05:17:56,090
That's not what color- that's not the right color. By the way, that's like yellow.

3411
05:17:56,090 --> 05:17:59,849
That's not even- you guys were- you guys were wrong. If you think it's that one, that's yellow.

3412
05:18:00,250 --> 05:18:07,369
It's five five- somebody got the right one. Let me see it.

3413
05:18:11,259 --> 05:18:13,819
Five five five twenty three e.

3414
05:18:15,069 --> 05:18:17,549
Five five five twenty three e.

3415
05:18:20,669 --> 05:18:22,669
I don't- no, that's not right. You just picked it.

3416
05:18:22,750 --> 05:18:41,000
Give a discord- I want a- I want an image. I demand it. I command it. You changed- that's not what it looks like on my screen.

3417
05:18:41,639 --> 05:18:47,000
Can I screenshot mine? Is my color wrong on my computer?

3418
05:18:49,720 --> 05:19:07,439
It doesn't look like this on my screen. That doesn't look like that. Why is yours way darker?

3419
05:19:08,240 --> 05:19:17,209
Does it look like that?

3420
05:19:17,209 --> 05:19:19,369
Mine is- mine's way lighter than that.

3421
05:19:23,959 --> 05:19:37,319
I'm gonna take a screenshot. Everybody hold on a second. Print screen.

3422
05:19:39,630 --> 05:19:44,110
Hold on. I'm gonna put this up next to this.

3423
05:19:44,669 --> 05:20:09,919
I feel like this is- I think that this is- this is- this is a lie. Hold on. A crop? Is it the same picture?

3424
05:20:35,209 --> 05:20:40,970
Um, so the- my monitor- my monitor's colors are

3425
05:20:41,610 --> 05:20:52,360
fucked up bad. It is not- it is incredibly- it's five times lighter when I look at it. Boy.

3426
05:20:52,680 --> 05:21:08,380
This is the image I just took.

3427
05:21:08,380 --> 05:21:10,380
And in fact, I think this is darker.

3428
05:21:14,009 --> 05:21:20,250
All right, but just do me a favor. Do me a quick little favor here, and I know you say green, green, green.

3429
05:21:20,729 --> 05:21:24,729
Green, green, green. But what is right- what is that? What's that right there?

3430
05:21:25,209 --> 05:21:35,959
That little sliver there? That little white area? What is that? What color could be in there?

3431
05:21:37,869 --> 05:21:46,040
Gray. My monitor's fucked. It's way lighter on my screen.

3432
05:21:46,599 --> 05:21:48,639
That's mold.

3433
05:21:48,639 --> 05:21:58,330
Whatever. I don't even care.

3434
05:21:58,330 --> 05:22:02,490
I was- all right. Well, a good thing I didn't bet- I didn't bet any money.

3435
05:22:05,319 --> 05:22:10,330
What- what the fuck happened? How did we get here? What's going on? Why am I doing this right now?

3436
05:22:10,729 --> 05:22:13,099
Why do I care about the grapefruit?

3437
05:22:13,180 --> 05:22:21,119
Oh, that's somebody's name! That's somebody raided the channel! Hey, that was the grapefruit raided the channel!

3438
05:22:23,229 --> 05:22:32,400
Thanks for the raid, dude. Appreciate it. We're gonna, uh, keep going. Close that out. All right, let's make this bigger.

3439
05:22:39,369 --> 05:22:43,290
Oh shit, I have to close this.

3440
05:22:43,290 --> 05:22:56,270
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

3441
05:22:59,599 --> 05:23:05,119
All right, we're back. What was the last thing that I just did?

3442
05:23:06,200 --> 05:23:10,040
All right, I need a shitload of truffle powder, and I'm good to go.

3443
05:23:10,860 --> 05:23:12,860
Truffle powder. Give it to me. Who's got it?

3444
05:23:14,889 --> 05:23:16,569
This'll take us

3445
05:23:16,569 --> 05:23:18,650
over five billion,

3446
05:23:18,650 --> 05:23:20,330
and then-

3447
05:23:20,330 --> 05:23:30,349
Oh, yep. This'll take us over five million, and I'm ready to spend money. Let's go back to Tokyo.

3448
05:23:31,720 --> 05:23:36,720
Tokyo. No, San Francisco, right? San Frans- no, we need to go to Tokyo for a second.

3449
05:23:47,689 --> 05:23:50,409
San Francisco. So in Tokyo, I wanted to do this.

3450
05:23:51,130 --> 05:23:55,360
I got a recipe for you. Whatever.

3451
05:23:55,439 --> 05:23:59,020
I need

3452
05:23:59,020 --> 05:24:00,380
strawberry shit.

3453
05:24:00,380 --> 05:24:04,540
Whatever. This was a wasted trip. I didn't mean to come here.

3454
05:24:05,099 --> 05:24:14,540
And then mangoes in Tokyo?

3455
05:24:14,540 --> 05:24:22,779
I need mangoes.

3456
05:24:22,779 --> 05:24:24,779
We're gonna get mangoes. Who's got mangoes?

3457
05:24:25,020 --> 05:24:27,849
Who's got mangoes?

3458
05:24:27,849 --> 05:24:31,770
Wellington.

3459
05:24:31,770 --> 05:24:33,770
Raid song. What raid? For what?

3460
05:24:45,200 --> 05:24:47,520
Now we're going off into San Francisco.

3461
05:24:52,330 --> 05:24:59,000
No, get out of here. I'm only working with big bucks now. Let's go make the- go to the chocolate building.

3462
05:25:02,060 --> 05:25:05,630
Change recipe. We're making the spicy Bowser.

3463
05:25:07,069 --> 05:25:18,380
Oh, fuck you.

3464
05:25:18,380 --> 05:25:20,430
Sell all this?

3465
05:25:20,430 --> 05:25:22,430
That's a lot to sell here.

3466
05:25:22,430 --> 05:25:25,119
400,000. Back over 400.

3467
05:25:26,060 --> 05:25:28,299
Breakfast blend. That's a good sale here.

3468
05:25:29,099 --> 05:25:31,099
4.3 million.

3469
