00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:10,570
Hey, what is going on everybody? Dermot here with Alien Isolation.

2
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:14,570
This is a brand new Steam game that came out a couple days ago.

3
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:19,570
And it's a horror game survival where you survive the alien.

4
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:25,809
Yes, it is. I'm Ripley's, uh, Ripley's, believe it or not, daughter, believe it or not.

5
00:00:25,809 --> 00:00:32,780
So I guess you need to explore in this game. There was a crash, oh no.

6
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:37,450
I need to investigate the mystery of the crash, which is what I plan on doing.

7
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:44,140
Let's go ahead and go. Oh, fuck. That's him.

8
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,140
Can I get away without him seeing? That's the main thing that's got to be...

9
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,140
No, no, he's right behind me. He's right behind me. Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

10
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:55,140
If I can make it up these stairs, please. It's an alien. It's a fucking alien.

11
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:03,420
Hey, where is he? Where'd he go? The doors are all locked.

12
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,420
I'm trapped in this spooky game. What do I do?

13
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,420
Oh, I guess I could climb in here. Turn my flashlight on.

14
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:14,730
An achievement. Nice. You know, I love getting achievements, especially when...

15
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,730
There he is. There he is again. He's in the vent. He's in the vent. He's in the vent.

16
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:21,730
Get out of the vent. Out of the vent. Down the stairs. Through the metal detectors.

17
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:25,730
Hopefully I don't have any weapons. Okay, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

18
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:28,730
Straight down, straight down, straight down the stairs.

19
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:30,730
Come on, come on, come on, come on. I know you can hide.

20
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:34,730
Hide in here. Open it. Okay.

21
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:40,269
I don't want to... If I make any noise, I'm going to be in a lot of trouble.

22
00:01:40,269 --> 00:01:44,269
God, there he is. Oh, please don't come in here and kill me.

23
00:01:44,269 --> 00:01:49,329
What the fuck is he doing? He's eating chicken. That's psycho.

24
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:52,569
He's eating chicken for... He's eating chicken for God's sake.

25
00:01:52,569 --> 00:01:55,569
Time to go. Time to go. Get out, get out, get out, get out.

26
00:01:55,569 --> 00:01:59,569
I'm going to go this way, up to the right. I think I'm in the clear.

27
00:01:59,569 --> 00:02:03,000
Pretty sure I'm in the clear right now. I don't know though.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
He's got a food item. He's got another food item. He's got ham now.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
What does he got? Chicken, ham, drinks? What does he got? Everything?

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm going to hide in this corner here. I've never seen the tutorial.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The tutorial said hide in a corner and he might not be able to see you.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,669
So I'm going to take his advice in areas he's just conga-ing right now.

33
00:02:22,669 --> 00:02:25,669
Which is a bad sign because they conga when they're very happy.

34
00:02:25,669 --> 00:02:28,669
Aliens will do that. He must have just gotten a kill on a soldier in the top there.

35
00:02:28,669 --> 00:02:32,669
I just don't want him to come this way. Thank God he's a brainless fuck.

36
00:02:32,669 --> 00:02:35,669
And he went the other way. I don't know how he did not see me.

37
00:02:35,669 --> 00:02:38,669
It's bright out here. But I need to be careful.

38
00:02:38,669 --> 00:02:43,669
Because if he is going to pop at me again and hit me, I don't want that to happen.

39
00:02:43,669 --> 00:02:46,669
No, no, no, no. Okay, okay. There he is. There he is. That was weird.

40
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:49,680
You know, hold on. He doesn't even know I'm here.

41
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,300
Can I just bash this guy's fucking head in?

42
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:59,300
I just beat the game. I just beat the game. I just beat Alien Isolation.
