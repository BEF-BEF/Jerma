1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:08,460
Oh, you can hear me. I'm just sitting there like silent on my phone tweeting. I was just like,

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:17,050
I'm muted, whatever. That's why I always have the mic muted, because I'm just sitting there like,

3
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:26,329
okay. But hey, how you doing? How's everybody doing? Sorry for the delay. There was a lot of

4
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:34,840
strange technical issues. Talix had problems with his capture card. The lobby system in the game is

5
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:41,380
really, really strange. It's kind of a weird roundabout system in EDF 5 to play together and

6
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:51,100
joining off of each other's sessions and stuff. It's very odd. But Earth Defense Force 5 today,

7
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:59,700
tonight, and depending on how much fun this game is, you may see it again, because I was a huge fan

8
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,390
of the last one. Played it at least three or four times on stream and I played a shitload of it

9
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:10,010
off stream too. So without further ado, because we've been kind of sticking around and waiting

10
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:17,079
around, I think we're pretty much ready to go. Let's go ahead and see who's available here to

11
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:32,579
speak. I wonder who's here. Hello there. Anybody there? Hello there. Hello there. I'm here. Are

12
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:38,099
you eating? We're gonna have to wait like 15 minutes because I just got food. What'd you get?

13
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:43,620
Sounds good. What food did you get? It's, you know, rice and vegetables and pork.

14
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:54,489
Okay. But, but is it, did you make it yourself or was it? Ashley made it for me. Okay. Nice. Okay.

15
00:01:54,489 --> 00:02:01,579
Sounds delicious. Because I'm an imbecile. I mean, I don't know how to do that, you know what I mean?

16
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:10,259
I don't know how to spell it out for us. Well, now we can start. I can eat and play because I'm a god

17
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:15,939
gamer. Cause I'd run a start because you're in, we're an hour late because of you as always. Hey,

18
00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:20,419
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. There were, excuse me. Hey, yeah, there were a lot of

19
00:02:20,419 --> 00:02:26,180
problems. Yes. Yes. Italics his capture card got fucked up, but he's got enough control over that

20
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,780
and you couldn't figure out how to add friends and you couldn't figure out how to invite me to a

21
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:37,659
lobby. Beyond that, I wasn't told that maybe his eating schedule was happening beforehand. So I

22
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:45,539
didn't know to prepare a head for dinner. All right. That's it. Stream over. I'm going to go

23
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:51,719
play. I'm going to go count peanuts down the street or something. Every time you beat Cloud

24
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:57,689
Amari, you grow one centimeter. Did I just turn my, I'm like naked and I think I just accidentally

25
00:02:57,689 --> 00:03:06,759
turned my webcam on. Did I do that? No, I didn't. Thank God. Are you naked? I don't, I don't wear

26
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:13,030
clothes. It's Alex. We live together. Can you please vouch for me? Why do I need somebody to

27
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:16,310
vouch for me for this? Hey dude, you like vouching, man. I don't wear clothes, right?

28
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:23,449
You don't wear clothes. Is that what you were asking me right now? I want you to confirm or

29
00:03:23,449 --> 00:03:28,169
deny the fact that how often do I wear clothes? Is this really the question you want to be asking

30
00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:33,289
me right now? I really want to know. Can you give like an example of talks? Give us an exam. When

31
00:03:33,289 --> 00:03:39,129
did you first find out he doesn't wear clothes? Um, before we even moved, he was like, by the way,

32
00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:42,969
I don't wear clothes. I'm going to have to start wearing clothes now. That was the first thing he

33
00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:52,889
said. It was pretty immediate, like full nude or like boxers or underwear. Well, obviously I've

34
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:59,689
never seen the full nude, but I was told the stories. No, listen, I, I, I, all I said was this.

35
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:03,210
I said, I just want to make sure that you're, I want to make sure that are you okay with this? Are

36
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:07,129
you okay with me walking around shirtless? Like, yo, yo, you okay with that? Like, is that okay?

37
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:12,629
And he was like, yeah, I've seen you shirtless. Yeah, I can vouch for this actually. Cause now

38
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:15,990
that I think about it, you take your shirt off whenever you get the chance.

39
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:22,870
I just have the opposite of a never nude. No, it's good. You're very comfortable that way.

40
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:26,310
Like a lot of people would be shy taking their shirt off in front of other people, but like you,

41
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:34,149
you push past that. It's a, it's a, it's like a sweaty comfort thing. And I make sure I know,

42
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:38,790
but okay, if I told you that it's Alex before we moved in and you were like, nah, man, that,

43
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:44,040
I don't think, I don't like that. I would, I would wear like a fucking shirt. I need to make,

44
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,079
I want to make sure that you were like, okay, like you cool with me, like hanging out like with on

45
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:52,439
the couch, like no clothes on, like no shirt on. I've mentioned, I never go swimming. Like I never

46
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:56,680
go to the pool. I've never seen another human being. No, the amount of times that we've like

47
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,680
shared a hotel room and you're like, I'm going to take a shower and you just take your shirt off

48
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,879
and then you start another conversation and stand there shirtless for 10 minutes. This is how

49
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:11,699
fanfiction starts every time. That's not every time. Probably every time we've had a hotel

50
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:19,800
together. It's happened at least once. I'm going to need to install Microsoft word after this.

51
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,600
And you get really weird towards the end of the conversation. You like flex an arm and kiss it.

52
00:05:27,579 --> 00:05:33,420
All right. All right. It's time. Are we ready to play the game? Yeah. I think we're finally ready

53
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:40,300
to play. Hey, welcome to EDF five. Uh, this has been doing the first mission.

54
00:05:43,769 --> 00:05:48,170
Are we? I mean, you're the guy, the guy with the fork and knife in his hand.

55
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:54,870
I'm eating with what the fuck are you writing here? Oh, we have a valiant infantry. We are

56
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,870
the alpha team with passion and I'm not nice. That was a great, but are you writing this?

57
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:03,189
I keep trying to change controls, like, like, oh, go to prepared and then complete the mission.

58
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:09,509
But I'm using the D pad and if you touch the D pad, it's like, cause it's a dialogue.

59
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:15,290
I thought you were actually typing this stuff in being like weird. No way. Okay. Okay. No way.

60
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:20,889
Yeah. I mean, like, I'm saying, okay, I have to, how do you ready? The top option preparation

61
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:26,970
complete. Yeah. All right. So let's go over our classes. Looks like we're late because of italics

62
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:34,730
again. Oh, okay. No, what? No, it was a collective. It was a collective star. Couldn't figure out

63
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:41,129
how to use the PlayStation. It was also the last one to use the bathroom and he's eating right now.

64
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:43,610
Yeah. And by the way, when we used to have hotel rooms,

65
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:52,579
yeah, he used to, he used to eat in the bathroom. He used to bring,

66
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:58,819
I do that. You're right. Basically. Yeah. You're next to the two queens. Just one was enough.

67
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:03,860
And he takes every time. No, no, no, no. You don't have to use trash bags. If you get next to the

68
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:09,620
toilet, no, you would sit there with the fork and knife of the plate on the toilet. And it was just,

69
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:14,660
it was, it was chaos. You would leave trash around. You would let you would just, uh, by the way,

70
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,300
the shower drain is not a garbage disposal. You don't dump the leftover shit that you don't want

71
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,339
to eat down there. I don't know why you would do that. Do you, do you understand how much

72
00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:26,899
throughout my lifespan, how much plastic I've saved and how much I've helped the environment

73
00:07:26,899 --> 00:07:34,819
because I do that? By what? Doing what now? Putting food down the sink. All right. Yeah.

74
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,240
All right. There we go. Fight the aliens guys. Stop, stop talking.

75
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:48,779
If I have to, if I have to talk one more time, I just realized the bugs and then you shoot the

76
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:53,660
bugs. Yeah, I know, but I've got like a mega shield. I don't know. I don't know what I do

77
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:58,699
either. Actually. Yeah. Well, I have this cannon. I've got throwing so much shade and look in the

78
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:07,529
mirror. Look in the mirror. I cry for like an hour. That's why you never go into the hotel bathroom.

79
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:12,170
Okay. Make sure you pick up the red cases. By the way, I'm coming to a realization that playing,

80
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:17,769
like you said, wing diver on console is probably not a great idea. Yeah. I'm, I'm already using

81
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:25,540
sad control scheme. I get to shoot a lot of bullets. So mine's working pretty good. Yeah.

82
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:29,620
I mean, you're like slow and dumpy anyway. I am. Yeah. I got to figure out how to go fast.

83
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:36,899
All right. So, um, this is the one I need to be using. I need to be using the plasma cannon

84
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:46,539
for sure. More like street corridor defense force. This is just the first level. I put the bombs on

85
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:53,019
you. So you have to go in. Okay. Um, hopefully they're pointing the other direction pointing

86
00:08:53,019 --> 00:09:01,019
the other direction. We have a GPS right now. Put the food down. There we go. That's the stuff.

87
00:09:02,059 --> 00:09:12,919
Okay. Hey guys, head to the ground surface. Yeah. Look, have you got arrows? Yeah. Hurry up guys.

88
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:19,419
Team leader. We have to go fight these dinosaurs. They're not dinosaurs. They're not

89
00:09:19,419 --> 00:09:26,940
fucking dinosaurs. I just hurt myself in the other room. How, how's that possible?

90
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:37,610
I just hurt myself in the room. Did that just happen? Hey, what do you, how loud are you?

91
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:42,730
I don't know. That might be too loud. Oh, okay. All right. Yeah. I've been needing to get a new

92
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:47,769
headset for a long time because my audio leaks and you're a streamer. I know one thing about

93
00:09:47,769 --> 00:09:53,529
you. Is there actually like a sprint button for me? Uh, left L3. Well, actually I think you get

94
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:59,529
like a dash. I think I can go by the way. I'm definitely going to get all the points here.

95
00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:06,970
Yeah. I remember his dash being cancelable. I think your bombs exploded. Unfortunately.

96
00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:18,840
There's health containers too. Oh, you guys are just making it over here. Hey guys. Yeah. You're

97
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:32,950
a lot faster. Yeah, I know. I forgot about that. Also my character only gets to shoot

98
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:39,029
like once every five seconds. Oh yeah. You're using like the vehicle guy, right? Yeah.

99
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:44,970
Do we get our own Diablo three loot systems part looting system here or is it do it? Am I

100
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:48,409
picking these up? Like if you pick up armor, you're taking it away from us. Am I actually?

101
00:10:48,409 --> 00:10:52,090
And you're, yeah. And you're going to be picking it all up because you're way faster. Never going

102
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:58,299
to get looted. Oh shit. Well, you just need to get good. Oh, I can push the bugs around.

103
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:05,340
Doesn't, doesn't fence or have a, um, a dash like you go rocket feet. I do that once

104
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:13,990
armor is shared. We'll get there eventually. All right. Hey, the armor is shared.

105
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,629
So if somebody picks it up, it's shared between us all. We're going to just get in here and just

106
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:41,940
fucking lighten them up. Oh, oh, just defeat these enemies. I don't want to die like that.

107
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,820
Is health shared too? If I pick it up, is it like share between everybody?

108
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:56,679
Probably not. What did you just say? So it's not like I'm hurt or anything.

109
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:06,389
Wait, what are you? What did, what's that? What's the last part? Oh, okay. I don't know what those

110
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:20,980
are. Is it in the hive? Oh, they're on the ceiling. You killed them already. What do you think I'm

111
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:28,740
trying? So what is, what does flyboy do? What is it like? What does your class do besides glide?

112
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:34,259
Uh, it's like rockets for us then. Oh, fine. I'm fine. I'll do everything. I'll do it all.

113
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:42,600
So is armor permanent? Like, yes. Yeah, it is a permanent. Do you play it on?

114
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:47,080
So if you don't like the, this character, then very soon you need to figure out if you want to

115
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:56,279
switch. So there's four classes initially. What does that turn into by? Only four. There's like

116
00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:04,860
a thousand weapons. But you unlock new weapons as you level up and stuff like that. Yeah. There's

117
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:12,519
only four classes, but there are hundreds and hundreds of weapons in the game. So it is not,

118
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:19,179
oh, only four classes. I get four abilities and an ultimate. Uh-uh. You get an ultimate. I don't

119
00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:25,299
know. Why am I making like a MOBA reference? You don't like even play those. I want to play

120
00:13:25,299 --> 00:13:31,379
those. It's not just MOBAs anymore. Uh, every single game has an ultimate ability now. That's,

121
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:39,620
I mean, that's kind of true. You know what? I'll hear that and raise you on every game. Also,

122
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:46,070
including like a boxed open. Is there loot crates in this game? There are. Oh, we have to go the

123
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:49,830
other. Why does he keep debating us? There are, because you just see I'm picking them up on the

124
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:56,970
ground. They don't have to pay for them though. So can I get those on the free to play model?

125
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:03,590
Yeah. Well, it's, it's free. It's free to play after you pay $60. Well, I paid 60 bucks. How

126
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:12,120
many keys do I get? I don't know. That star knows that more than I do. The reason my star is not

127
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:22,500
talking. He's got things to do. You got like a piece of ham stuck in your throat or something

128
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:28,679
there. Sure. I'm up. Pay attention. Monsters are coming from the hole. He's eating with his

129
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:35,110
mic muted. No, you're doing that. No, I want you to eat with the mic on so you can call out shots

130
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:40,710
to talk to my viewers about the questions they ask without interrupting your important conversation

131
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:51,370
that you were having. It was very important. Oh, there's the dash. Oh yeah. And our weapon boxes

132
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:57,850
that you need to find. Yeah. So here's a question for the chat room here. Uh, is, yeah. Are

133
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:02,649
because I've been, I picked up at least three of them. So are they shared to share? Good sick.

134
00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:15,049
Nice. I've never played this game before. Uh, I figured out my dash. So far the tutorial was

135
00:15:15,049 --> 00:15:21,450
definitely the best part. Earth corridor. If I complimented me like, oh, you can, you can talk

136
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:26,090
on the radio and you can summon vehicles and you can do all this. Someone must really trust you.

137
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:30,409
You must be a high ranked officer. And then you made me look left and right and told me I was

138
00:15:30,409 --> 00:15:37,210
impressive for doing it. Well, you got a participation award. So I just had to get a

139
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:43,289
medal. So, well, I, the boy scouts watch out for monsters. Don't worry about stealing loot. All

140
00:15:43,289 --> 00:15:48,100
right. That's cool. Right. You guys point them out. I'll get up there and I'll fly up there.

141
00:15:53,049 --> 00:15:59,850
This base is too big for humans. It must be designed for mechas. I was about to say basically

142
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:06,250
they made this facility exclusively so it could be invaded by giant. Yeah. Yeah.

143
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:12,759
But it's a, it's supposed to be like that. Don't worry. I'm going to use the gun.

144
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:21,899
I don't like EDF because it's bad because they say bad dumb dialogue. That's part. That's part

145
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:29,929
of the allure. That's part of the lotster. They're singing. Be respectful.

146
00:16:29,929 --> 00:16:34,500
Isn't there any response from the ground? That's what your character does.

147
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:41,220
You just have a big lunchbox. Oh yeah. I got lunchboxes and inside the lunchbox is a gun.

148
00:16:49,129 --> 00:16:52,730
Oh, how do you chant EDF? That just scared the shit out of me. What you just did. I thought you

149
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:59,769
were yelling. You have the, uh, the touch pad on PS4. Yeah. You're playing with regular menu.

150
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:06,920
Oh, there's that. Also, I think the d-pad has all the stuff in it. I'm sorry.

151
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:09,559
I think to do the whole song, you need the

152
00:17:13,769 --> 00:17:20,410
voice so much louder. I like your pink Power Ranger costume by the way.

153
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:29,160
It's the lore. Oh, that's come on guys. Don't you dare. The least annoying voice in the game.

154
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:40,789
Part of the lotster. Oh my God. Your gun looks like you're about to refuel a car.

155
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:51,930
Gas pump. I'll see you have high heels, which is really, but I fly. I fly. So why do you have

156
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:55,930
high heels to get up to the air quicker? Touch the ground. So they're very comfortable because

157
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:58,809
he never has to walk. You don't know what those are. Those could be springboards.

158
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:09,460
I don't like playing this character because when I fly in the air, I don't hear all the fun dialogue

159
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:19,019
because why I don't hear all the fun dialogue because I'm too far away. Does it have simulated

160
00:18:19,019 --> 00:18:25,579
5.1 surround sound boys? No, it's too far away. I'm just flying around and I'm up in the air and I

161
00:18:25,579 --> 00:18:30,940
can't hear what he does saying. I feel like I need to be part of the amount of ammo and everything.

162
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:40,390
You just keep standing. No, I don't want to do that anymore. Thank you. All right. Shout out crates

163
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:44,549
if you see him because I got nothing else to do while my gun reloads for 30 seconds.

164
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:56,230
Console controls. Come on. Health pack. That's why I'm playing Air Raider Man

165
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:01,430
because vehicles don't feel like garbage to drive with a controller. So is the Ranger the only one

166
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:09,460
that can drive vehicles or? Oh, fuck. They're monsters. I was wondering that myself. I think

167
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:14,420
I can drive them and Rangers can drive them. Yeah. You can spawn them. I think Rangers can also drive

168
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:27,579
them. Yeah. Don't like Flyboy and you won't be able to use my wheel. I am the wheel. That would

169
00:19:27,579 --> 00:19:42,279
be silly. All right. Shout out crates. I gotta eat this food. Will you stop eating? I haven't been

170
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:52,470
eating. I don't see any extra crates. Fun hating streamer refuses to spam voice lines. I'm a fun

171
00:19:52,470 --> 00:20:04,059
streamer. See? I'm a hilarious streamer. See? And I apologize to you guys too. All right. I think

172
00:20:04,059 --> 00:20:12,970
we've just beat level one. Quick, go into the light. He thinks if he doesn't get your attention

173
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:22,420
with one type of voice or like change his tone. Help. We did it. Ladies and gentlemen, that is

174
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:25,859
EDF. No, it's not. That's like bullshit. That was just like a shitty walk around in a hallway.

175
00:20:25,859 --> 00:20:35,029
Mission complete. Game's over. This is what you play for. So it looks like we got a missile

176
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:40,869
launcher for the Ranger. Do we have the same screen? I think so. Yeah. Just total items acquired

177
00:20:40,869 --> 00:20:46,549
here. Look at all my items I get to use next round. Yeah. You will launch a lot of new things.

178
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:53,339
Are we sure? Are we sure? I got three things. All right. Short range. I'm gonna take a look at

179
00:20:53,339 --> 00:21:05,740
those. We got armor up. The power lance. There's so much text. Hold the trigger to fire it.

180
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:11,140
Power lance is in the short term. Yeah. There's a lot to look at here.

181
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:18,900
I just look at what the numbers are. You know what I mean? Yeah. But there's a lot of numbers.

182
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:25,539
I know. But like, yeah, like the rank of your equipment actually. Yeah. Is very important.

183
00:21:26,259 --> 00:21:30,329
So if you have like one that's a four and one that's a zero. Just charge the casket.

184
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:34,170
It's a big deal. Long range laser gun. Actually I kind of like this.

185
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:39,670
Also snipe distant enemies. Firepower was lower but can destroy a target by continuously firing.

186
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:53,700
Accumulate energy by holding it down. Okay. Plasma core that specializes in flying.

187
00:21:54,259 --> 00:22:00,660
Board acceleration has increased. Damn. There's so much. Dude, you can read. I look like a

188
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:06,470
disgruntled construction worker. Let me get here. I'm just orange and yellow with the

189
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:11,269
like safety vest. I'm ready. Whenever Jerm is ready because he's the one we're waiting for.

190
00:22:11,269 --> 00:22:17,190
But I'm the one that just got like seven new items to look at. I think the items that we're

191
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:24,549
getting by the way are um, we all get the same amount but what items you get are. Oh okay. Yeah

192
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:29,509
because I got a whole bunch from me and I didn't see any for your quest. Let me try this thing.

193
00:22:29,509 --> 00:22:34,950
I guess there was one new fencer item and two upgraded ones for me. I'm just gonna sit here

194
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:40,390
and eat while you guys talk about your little weapons you got. Hey I love the new Diablo

195
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:47,349
expansion. Oh you don't have phones? Just armor. Wait you can you can bring your armor down? Why

196
00:22:47,349 --> 00:22:52,819
would you do that? I think it's to scale your slight to lower level people. I'm gonna make

197
00:22:52,819 --> 00:23:13,619
the Jerma colors. Hold on. All right. Um I'm ready. Mission two. Um you guys ever use a

198
00:23:13,619 --> 00:23:20,440
mortar before? Um mortar? Wrong colors. The light mortar. You don't think I know my own colors?

199
00:23:21,579 --> 00:23:33,369
What? Try it out buddy. All right. I will. Yeah but I mean I can't. It's not gonna work guys.

200
00:23:34,009 --> 00:23:42,920
There's not an entire that's as close as I'm gonna get it. More pink but there I can't select it. I

201
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:49,299
was told that I was the last one not ready. I'm being screamed at right now. Hold on. Oh you can

202
00:23:49,299 --> 00:24:05,220
do triangle for whatever. I'll fix it later. I don't want anyone to yell at me. You will not fix

203
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:13,269
it and you know it. Okay everybody's muted right now. I just I looked over and the discord was

204
00:24:13,269 --> 00:24:21,079
just muted. So I'm gonna mute too. Fine. All right what's this new weapon I got? Can I zoom in with

205
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:28,660
this? Oh how do I let go of this? Oh my god are those dinosaurs in the sky? How do I? Holy shit.

206
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:37,930
Okay this now. Welcome to EDF. This is a yes the proper mission. I'll get it. I'll get it.

207
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:47,670
Look at this guy. I don't remember how to come close. All right so this is like a little.

208
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:58,460
I actually like this gun. Please. What do you want me to do? I wanted to see if I could drive him.

209
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:24,119
Christmas presents hold on. Oh by the way for those of you all you guys watching right now

210
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:28,119
we are playing this is on normal difficulty because you want you have to really play

211
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:36,200
to collect the boxes first. Once you get enough boxes. Yeah that was a pretty big mistake too.

212
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:40,519
Because you could beat the starting missions on like very hard but after a while

213
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:46,759
you didn't have enough armor to beat the later missions. So what's the like highest

214
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:57,750
difficulty in the whole game? Inferno which is insane. God. Well that gun kind of is terrible.

215
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:05,819
Hey uh hey hey. Holy shit. Hey germamites am I like crazy or has that gone terrible?

216
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:09,849
Oh it's pretty bad man. I'm watching your stream too while I'm playing.

217
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:17,799
Yeah that's new. Did you just drop like an airstrip of bombs? Well you you you pressed

218
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:22,200
a call on the bomber and it gives like a it zooms you way out and you place it on the ground now

219
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,000
before you just like threw a smoke and guess where it was gonna go.

220
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:36,970
How much does first aid heal? Um does it heal everybody or just like the no it depends on how

221
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:41,049
big the box is. It's like maybe 10 for a little one and maybe 25 for a big one.

222
00:26:42,009 --> 00:26:53,180
Let me see. Does this gun suck or what? I don't get it. I mean no guns should currently suck.

223
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,339
Just seems like it takes a long time to kill anyway.

224
00:27:05,019 --> 00:27:11,579
Here we go. I'm calling in. I'm calling in the thing. I can't wait to see this. I'm so

225
00:27:11,579 --> 00:27:15,099
excited for this. I hope it kills you. It's not gonna kill me. I'm not even over there.

226
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,579
Yeah also it never used to show allies where it was coming in before. Did you do that sir?

227
00:27:20,059 --> 00:27:23,900
I did. What a cool character. I did that.

228
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:42,599
I wonder if this is like spear gun. Oh oh oh oh oh I like lost audio. There were so many explosions.

229
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:49,990
Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Are you doing the green lasers?

230
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:57,930
I am. The green laser is not good. I'm doing it wrong. There's so much going on.

231
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:02,089
So well are all these like friendly mechs here pilotable or are they just like decorations?

232
00:28:02,089 --> 00:28:10,140
I think they're decorations. They're sad because they're funny. Air raider you get like vehicles

233
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:15,980
later so I can summon those for other things. There's like megazords and crazy stuff. The

234
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:20,700
helicopters. My eyes. Oh hold on I'll get these. You guys stick with the plan.

235
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:27,960
This is a special news flash. There have been accounts of UFO sightings everywhere across the

236
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:34,920
globe. So how the hell if you don't have a winged diver in your party how on earth do you collect

237
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:44,359
items? You don't. You kind of just don't huh? I think I think like if I had a tank or one of

238
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:52,200
the jeeps I could do it. Oh yeah you can get a ventral now. Should I get them all?

239
00:28:53,160 --> 00:29:02,660
Okay incoming another way. Ranger can sprint and get to the loot radius now. That's cool.

240
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:06,339
And these upgrades to aerator are really nice.

241
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:15,299
I'm just realizing this is using my jetpack. That's why I don't like it.

242
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:22,339
So I guess you have like a limited amount you can just fly around and just get to like land

243
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:30,099
birds. Yeah it's it's kind of like it's like a standard jetpack in video game where it has a bar.

244
00:29:32,819 --> 00:29:37,960
It's clear. Yeah I like this thing but I don't like the I'm gonna replace this button.

245
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:43,289
Don't for some of you guys. Oh my god. Some of you guys would like the long range I think.

246
00:29:43,849 --> 00:29:55,369
You'd like the longer range and a little more direct control. But me I'm not like that. You're

247
00:29:55,369 --> 00:30:07,400
super cool. Thanks man. Hey why don't you pick up this armor? I'm going for it. There's a lot to

248
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:15,400
pick up. Oh my god there's a lot over here actually. Get that weapon. Oh I got it. I got it.

249
00:30:16,579 --> 00:30:20,549
Okay we're good. Wow they give you five seconds after the mission's over huh?

250
00:30:22,309 --> 00:30:27,349
Look at oh okay it's definitely shared but there's quite a bias here. Okay I'm I don't know about

251
00:30:27,349 --> 00:30:34,170
that. Hey uh who's the new player? Is that me the fencer? That seems like pretty heavy bias. Oh

252
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:40,329
really? What do you mean? I think I picked the correct class here. Uh do you not see the items

253
00:30:40,329 --> 00:30:44,490
acquired? I'm gonna need about uh that's what I said earlier is that there are minutes or so if

254
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:49,690
that's okay? It depends on your character like I got a whole bunch of air raider stuff. You did?

255
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:54,170
I got a whole bunch of fencer stuff. Yeah because of what I'm playing. I got a couple of other

256
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:58,089
classes things but the majority is it is going to be the class you're playing. I got combat

257
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:02,730
bombers out here. So we've got class specific loot. Yeah that's plus one letter grade at least. Oh

258
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:08,730
okay but don't call me down. No one listens to me. No I was listening to you but then like I heard

259
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:14,329
you listen wait wait wait listens but Italics last mission you were like just ignored you but

260
00:31:14,329 --> 00:31:20,200
last mission you were like oh I didn't get anything or I didn't get shit. Didn't you say

261
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:25,640
that? I did not say that. I got three new things. What the fuck is happening? You're hallucinating.

262
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:39,660
Oh this is better. So they actually have the star system here. Everybody make their new character.

263
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,920
Yeah the fun thing about the game is that like pretty much every mission you get

264
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:49,960
pretty much every class plays with. Yeah pretty much every class. Yeah it's really she had it

265
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:53,960
fine. Super well balanced. I can't wait till the PvP mode comes up. There's so many items.

266
00:31:54,920 --> 00:32:00,299
It's just like a giant toy box of different weapons. When are they going to release the

267
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:17,880
cowboy character? Thrown by hand. Shotgun. Oh I got to use the gun. You can't be ready. We just

268
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:26,019
got eight new weapons. I can only put like one of them just come on man. The game doesn't even

269
00:32:26,019 --> 00:32:30,900
start until I get a vehicle. This thing I don't like this thing at all. So let me change this

270
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:36,420
thing at least. Yeah I basically am Bob. I'm playing Bob the Builder. It's probably a shotgun.

271
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:47,180
Like why the heck not? Charge. Maximum energy. Maybe you can tell me this. I have two hammers.

272
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:56,759
They're close range weapons. If I'm so slow how do you use melee? How do you use melee? Yeah I have

273
00:32:56,759 --> 00:33:02,200
two hammers. I could do like dual with the old hammers. I'm telling you like one of the items

274
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:06,440
that you got I think it might have been the shield. Someone who's a brilliant gamer at this

275
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:12,359
game let me know what that brilliant gamer the uh the big boy do the dash cancel so you could

276
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:18,710
fly around everywhere. I think it was any melee weapon you would need equipped and then you would

277
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:27,609
have a a dash cancel ability. Lances. Yeah I remember lances being able to do it maybe. Shield

278
00:33:27,609 --> 00:33:41,319
lances yeah. Shield lets you dash cancel. Yeah so mess around with trying to trying to do that.

279
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:50,890
Yeah it's lances. This game is fucking fun as hell. We're saying deflect shield. Don't you guys

280
00:33:50,890 --> 00:34:01,079
think this game is just fun as hell? No. They patched the dash cancel apparently. Says somebody

281
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:09,719
over here. They better not have. Fucking blizzard is always like ruining their game with fixing

282
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:17,099
bugs that were fun. Oh by the way we didn't even get a we didn't even get a star underscore

283
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:23,820
reaction to Diablo Immortal. You didn't? No we didn't. We played like Lethal League and then

284
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:28,699
you rage quit and left. I thought I talked to you about it. We didn't get like an on camera response.

285
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:32,619
On camera response? Yeah we played Lethal League and you rage quit and I haven't talked to you in

286
00:34:32,619 --> 00:34:38,869
like three weeks. Oh it's been three weeks? It's been when did Lethal League come out?

287
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:45,590
Well I didn't miss you. I said that it was clearly Mike Morhaime did the right thing

288
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:55,690
by stepping down and he picked a very good time to get out and it's only going to get worse.

289
00:34:57,019 --> 00:35:03,500
It's sad. Are we talking about blizzard drama? It's sad. Yeah sad. Look at the sky. Dude you're

290
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:07,420
fucking huge. That cloud looks like a like an ostrich.

291
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:17,750
I was trying look at how cool that is. I gotta have a new bow. I think we have to destroy it.

292
00:35:21,989 --> 00:35:26,949
I don't know. Okay this is this is my move now. This thing is cool. This is also my move.

293
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:34,809
I only have 10 bullets each. I'm bombing them both. Get out of the way.

294
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:41,619
Get I trust you'll get out of the way. Get out of the way. Oh that way. Get out of that way.

295
00:35:42,579 --> 00:35:53,559
You missed me good. Can I go in the red circle now? I'm out of juice. Mommy yeah.

296
00:35:54,199 --> 00:36:04,260
Eat shit. Watch this one baby. That's so fun. I can just charge them up. Doesn't seem very effective.

297
00:36:06,019 --> 00:36:10,230
I missed this game. If I knew we were going to be fighting pylons I would have gone like the

298
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:13,829
single target mortar thing. Should we be focusing the pylons or the ants?

299
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:21,579
Probably the pylon at this point. I'm shooting the pylon. Well I'm getting the stuff.

300
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:26,300
That soldier just said body shot. Like he was something I fucking body shot me.

301
00:36:27,579 --> 00:36:35,179
I'm calling in more bombs. Oh come on. I only have one booster. Does that mean friendly fire is on?

302
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:40,059
Actually I don't think friendly fire comes on until like on the higher difficulties.

303
00:36:40,059 --> 00:36:45,050
That might you might have you might be on to something there. Oh yeah because I was

304
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:49,610
boiling up explosives on italics when he was fine. That's true you did line me with explosives.

305
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:58,469
Yeah I don't think you need to worry about it. The lightning gun is actually really fun. It

306
00:36:58,469 --> 00:37:11,659
spreads everywhere. It uses a lot of resources though. I'm shooting a stationary target over

307
00:37:11,659 --> 00:37:18,889
and over again. My stream is loving this game. This is a fun game. Oh my goodness there's a herping.

308
00:37:20,699 --> 00:37:27,269
Wait you have herpes? Oh I can charge the hammers. Don't wait on me. Wait what?

309
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:32,809
There's like so many goodies in there and I can't get in there. Charge it all the way up.

310
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:44,010
All right I got them all. Another pylon. I love the dialogue in this game. Will we bring in more

311
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:52,070
monsters? I think this is it guys. We kill them we save the world. What is that song? Yeah what is

312
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:57,590
playing? I thought one of you was like playing. You got to go to the other pylon. I'm on the way.

313
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:07,429
It is said to be 10 meters long, extremely aggressive, and will most likely attack humans.

314
00:38:07,429 --> 00:38:11,829
Stay tuned for more updates. Uh oh something's going to attack humans. Something's going to go

315
00:38:11,829 --> 00:38:15,909
after the humans. I swear to god if you're not picking up all the weapon boxes Jerma.

316
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:27,510
I am doing my work okay. All right so attack the upper part. Yeah yeah dude the purple thing at the

317
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:34,150
top. All right I got some time here too. Let's get up there. Watch this point blank eat shit.

318
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:43,860
Watch this one. You're doing the objective. Oh god I had to have done at least two damage there.

319
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:51,849
Guys had you been hitting the bottom part of it? No I was yes. Hitting the bottom part of what?

320
00:38:52,489 --> 00:38:57,690
The pylon. Yeah I have. Yeah we both have it. So it's not just me. Yeah it's not just me.

321
00:39:00,179 --> 00:39:03,059
To be fair my weapon can only hit the bottom part of the pylon.

322
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:09,500
Yeah how's this for the bottom part of the pylon?

323
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:17,539
Oh I thought you were talking. Yeah I just did it. I thought you were being naughty.

324
00:39:18,179 --> 00:39:33,989
What the fuck? What where am I? Yes sir. All right I'm good. All right did I get all the boxes in there?

325
00:39:35,849 --> 00:39:39,820
It'll cause casualties but not only that casualties.

326
00:39:44,469 --> 00:39:47,510
All right I gotta move. All right there are boxes over here. Sorry guys.

327
00:39:47,510 --> 00:40:03,800
Do you think I'm supposed to travel abroad next week? All right now I can actually help.

328
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:13,849
I'm coming. Oh no. The last EDF like four the monsters had been dormant but this game now

329
00:40:13,849 --> 00:40:19,130
like everyone doesn't know what they are again. What are they? It's a full reboot.

330
00:40:20,809 --> 00:40:26,949
We rebooted the lore. It's true. It really is true. Man and I read the whole wiki before

331
00:40:26,949 --> 00:40:35,420
this game just to prepare. No it's monsters. Weapons.

332
00:40:36,219 --> 00:40:40,539
I need to get some more fuel in the tank.

333
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:45,420
Also I think it's safe to assume that in this world ants don't exist

334
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:50,150
because no one knew what ants were when they showed up. They said they were dinosaurs.

335
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:57,030
What are they? Dinosaurs? They would technically not be ants unless they were enlarged by some kind

336
00:40:57,030 --> 00:41:01,429
of reverse shrink ray right? They would be like because they look the same doesn't mean they're

337
00:41:01,429 --> 00:41:07,190
the same. I think we get it.

338
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:26,980
I love this game. Here come more pylons. I love the double hammers you got there.

339
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:35,239
Oh my god. I imagine if we started on hard. Hey guys start on hard like we did last time.

340
00:41:38,179 --> 00:41:46,630
Yeah that's the they said we got to retreat. I wonder what we got what's inside of our boxes.

341
00:41:51,289 --> 00:41:54,889
Dude you didn't pick up any weapon boxes. There weren't any.

342
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:59,820
There was a shitload of armor boxes. We only got four weapons this time. They weren't they were

343
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:03,820
only like three or four. Look at the amount of armor. Look at the HP that I gave you.

344
00:42:10,219 --> 00:42:17,639
I got another spark vine. Is this new? Could you get better versions of the same weapon before?

345
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:23,639
What? Yeah. You could? I don't remember this kind of upgrading part where you can pick up

346
00:42:23,639 --> 00:42:29,960
better versions of the same weapon. Yeah one of the reasons we never noticed it is because we

347
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:35,480
started on like the hard difficulty so we had the best versions of every weapon. Oh okay makes

348
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:46,260
sense. So what does a star mean next to level? I don't know. If level is the most important

349
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:50,980
factor. This thing is cool. There's like an empty star number too. Yeah I've been looking

350
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:55,619
at it. It's been confusing me. Okay literally the first weapon of the that I see here in chat is

351
00:42:55,619 --> 00:43:05,099
what I'm gonna pick. I don't care what it is. Like there's something on this list. Sparks. Okay.

352
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:15,110
Flog. I'm really confused. Oh it means it's for me. It's a star. I like the the shotgun's really

353
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:27,460
cool but I'm gonna try the grenade. I'm gonna try missile launchers. I'm gonna try readying up.

354
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:52,380
I don't know how to do that. Chut up. No you chuddle. No you chuddle. It's always a talent.

355
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:58,679
I can't help it. You gave me too much power.

356
00:44:02,059 --> 00:44:06,219
Why can you do that? Why are there like 30 different versions of ha ha ha?

357
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:15,260
Ha ha ha. Go to it. Look at it. Yeah I know. It's for how you want to express yourself.

358
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:27,780
My apology. Blink ball. Let's see what it does. It is just a grenade huh? Oh man that's kind of

359
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:32,099
cool. That takes a long time to recharge though. Oh yeah this is the one that I actually have to

360
00:44:32,099 --> 00:44:46,550
shoot I think. I get it you're sorry. Oof. Oof. Oof. Roblox. Roblox. Oof. Roblox? No Roblox. Oof.

361
00:44:47,829 --> 00:44:58,840
Oof. I'm really late to these memes. I'm fucking old. Oh we have to destroy pylons. Okay.

362
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:09,800
We're talking about like. Yeah pylons. Oh check this. I don't know what an ion shield does.

363
00:45:11,929 --> 00:45:16,889
Off the top of your head. You remember how many times we did like the first mission and the last

364
00:45:16,889 --> 00:45:27,130
one? Oh everything about that was what I liked. Everything about that is what I liked. Oops.

365
00:45:27,769 --> 00:45:39,050
Twitch chat is all chat. Twitch chat boomers. Twitch chat is all twitch chat boomers. All right

366
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:43,849
did people call you guys boomers in your chat? I've never called them boomers. Oh I found my

367
00:45:43,849 --> 00:45:53,860
favorite weapon now. I'm actually becoming a Gundam. Dude. That's just kind of hard to aim on console.

368
00:45:53,860 --> 00:46:03,699
It doesn't matter it's gonna go bot. That's what I was trying to do. Bingo. Um I'll just for well

369
00:46:03,699 --> 00:46:09,909
yeah this film's really good at killing pylons. I'm on I'm on pylon duty. All right I'm gonna be on

370
00:46:09,989 --> 00:46:15,179
collect. Get these damn bugs off me. Hey get these damn bugs off me.

371
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:25,800
Nobody calls you guys boomers. There's a weapon crate right here. I'm trying to figure out where

372
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:34,119
they fell. There's one right here. I know. Does anyone call you boomers? Yes. Why would they call

373
00:46:34,119 --> 00:46:40,280
someone who is like seven years younger than you boomers too? I don't know. Oh what? You can't

374
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:49,670
stand on the tank. I don't know. People just say it to me in a very in a very mean way.

375
00:46:51,260 --> 00:47:05,739
I hope you can still put z gun on the tank. Check it three two one action. I did that. That was me.

376
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:13,500
I did that. That wasn't you. Yes it was. That was some guy like sitting at a computer somewhere.

377
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:20,300
Hey so what we're doing. Yeah why don't you ask anyone. It was me. No it was me. I made

378
00:47:21,099 --> 00:47:26,619
you. Okay fine. You ask me anything guys. You too. AMA. We're doing an AMA right now. Not not chat.

379
00:47:26,619 --> 00:47:37,340
I'm talking with YouTube. What direction is the gigantic ship in? North. I feel like I know

380
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:47,219
everything that I need to know. Yeah you probably do. This is really hard to aim. It just kind of

381
00:47:47,219 --> 00:47:53,239
is and how. Wait that didn't. That's L2. That's really weird. Watch out there's a new pylon.

382
00:47:54,650 --> 00:48:09,860
That camera switch is like. Yeah. Like it. I feel like you probably got asked a lot of questions

383
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:15,059
and didn't AMA. Oh you said it was just for us. Yeah you said it was just for us. That was the

384
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:25,539
only question in my AMA. What is this indicator. There's nothing that I care enough about. Are you

385
00:48:25,539 --> 00:48:31,139
sure. Yeah. There's nothing that you want to ask anything. I mean I'm talking anything. This is

386
00:48:31,139 --> 00:48:48,730
ask me anything. What's your twitch password. What's your stream key. Oh oh oh. How much money

387
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:56,869
would it take to play the new Diablo on launch and stream it. The Diablo immortal. I want to do that.

388
00:48:57,510 --> 00:49:01,590
Dude if like someone gave me a way to stream from a phone then I didn't have to figure out myself

389
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:08,150
100 percent. It's very very easy. You just need to get them down. Just get the it's just the HDI

390
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:15,909
it's the HDMI adapter for like apples. You just go to the apple store you pay like the forty five

391
00:49:15,909 --> 00:49:22,420
dollars for this piece of plastic and you just plug in HDMI to it and plug that into like a

392
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:30,260
capture card. That's it. I'm ready. Oh dude I actually you tried to play with me one time

393
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:36,739
20 years ago. The media and Excel. Yes. You know media and Excel is getting like a

394
00:49:36,739 --> 00:49:41,059
an HD remastered kind of thing coming out. Interesting. You know that I downloaded that

395
00:49:41,059 --> 00:49:48,739
like four like five days ago. Not even good. I'll prove it to him. He hasn't been pitching

396
00:49:48,739 --> 00:49:54,260
about the Diablo for at least three weeks now. That's correct. What's the Diablo. All of it.

397
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:59,940
What what do you explain yourself. Diablo mortal thing and I was like what the heck.

398
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:07,219
Oh well media and Excel things coming out too. Hey I look I'm going to prove to you.

399
00:50:08,659 --> 00:50:15,300
I don't know what you're proving. That I like downloaded it. I have media and Excel installed

400
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:21,860
on my computer. I swear to god right now. The new Diablo was revealed. Diablo 2. Oh well they're

401
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:26,500
coming out with like the new version of it that has like it's the HD remastered better than

402
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:31,780
Blizzard could ever do it version. Really. Yeah it's getting like the skills are being remapped

403
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:37,860
like all the UI is on. They built a new engine. It's a widescreen. I thought it didn't just release.

404
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:42,179
It didn't that just happen or is that something else. No they just announced it so that's coming

405
00:50:42,179 --> 00:50:46,980
out in January. Um okay. They've been working on that for a long time. That sounds like fun.

406
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:50,260
I would highly recommend you try it with me because I'm down to.

407
00:50:51,059 --> 00:50:57,619
And I know all the you need the ins and outs. Yeah I did install the the original one.

408
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:05,130
The original one I know I can I can prove to you know what despite what I said the day that the

409
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:09,929
Diablo thing was announced I also installed the game except I installed path of exile.

410
00:51:10,889 --> 00:51:19,300
Yeah well median xl like the guy who made median xl did a lot of work on path of exile.

411
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:24,010
What is going on over here? It's a lot like path of exile. You should try it too italics.

412
00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:27,210
I'm converting everyone. What are we doing? Is there are we waiting for something?

413
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:29,690
Shoot the UFO or they're dropping bad guys in.

414
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:37,050
Building just collapsed and I'm standing. Yeah I've launched rockets at it. Hit it.

415
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:46,820
Hit it right in the middle. They're dropping down like CDs. Yeah it's just a disc shooter

416
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:56,070
from like the 90s 90s boomers. I mean there's a game that was on ps2 so. I missed a weapon

417
00:51:56,070 --> 00:52:00,469
crate I was too big whatever. I can't do all the work. You know he missed a weapon crate.

418
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:09,340
Uh people is see it. If they show up his w's on the map. Plasma big. We're about to get this w.

419
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:16,869
Oh I didn't get anything new. I'm ready. An up way. Oh another one. Oh another one.

420
00:52:19,539 --> 00:52:23,300
All right so I did but I'm not going to be the last one to ready this time. What am I doing?

421
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:30,659
Wait does it say what we're fighting? That would be really nice if it did.

422
00:52:30,659 --> 00:52:37,159
I don't know. Oh the flying objects. Oh god. Pulse machine gun. I kind of want to try it.

423
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:53,769
All right the first thing that I see in chat. Uh machine gun. Wait this is the two different

424
00:52:53,929 --> 00:52:59,719
it's just this one. No I want to get rid of this. It's too hard to aim on console.

425
00:53:00,599 --> 00:53:11,429
All right I'm going to try that again. Oh god Jerma. I got a lot of new stuff.

426
00:53:11,989 --> 00:53:15,429
I'm ready. It's going to be flying enemies. You're not even ready.

427
00:53:15,429 --> 00:53:19,190
Why are you complaining to me? Because I'm waiting for you. I was looking at things

428
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:23,829
because you were looking at things. It perpetuates itself. You can't be mad at me

429
00:53:23,829 --> 00:53:31,289
because you were also looking at your equipment. Isn't that the whole point of playing this game?

430
00:53:32,489 --> 00:53:39,210
Kind of. Oh new weapon. Spiders. I remember these. I hate these. New weapon spiders.

431
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:45,559
I hate these things. I fucking hate them. They're so scary. Oh the ones that like shoot webs

432
00:53:45,559 --> 00:53:52,760
and everything. They make really creepy noises. Plasma big cannon. Yes this spaceship was made

433
00:53:52,760 --> 00:54:03,800
by Russians. That's a big cannon. What are those? Oh god actual boomers in chat. Zoom in.

434
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:13,559
Oh what are those? I don't think this is I don't think I have a good load-up for this level.

435
00:54:13,559 --> 00:54:17,559
Actually laugh at that. Dude I said it was going to be flying enemies like three times

436
00:54:17,559 --> 00:54:20,280
so that you would be ready for this. Shut up you fucking boomer. Fuck.

437
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:26,440
There is nothing that I like about you. Actually this is this is pretty good.

438
00:54:34,869 --> 00:54:44,059
I'm taking out saucers man. Oh we're taking this. Plasma big cannon.

439
00:54:49,909 --> 00:54:52,730
That's the kind of noise you would actually make if that happened to you.

440
00:54:55,480 --> 00:55:01,219
So what does air support do right now? Don't you have like jets you can call into like

441
00:55:01,219 --> 00:55:04,019
How do I turn this off? I think they were shooting through the thing.

442
00:55:05,139 --> 00:55:12,280
It looked like they were. Oh it's where okay. I kind of enjoy just one-shotting all these.

443
00:55:13,239 --> 00:55:16,360
Yeah it's shooting through the big ship. I like it's not there.

444
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:24,630
That wasn't boxes. I don't see any boxes. This one. Why does my shotgun have knockback on these?

445
00:55:25,429 --> 00:55:36,340
That's cool it like tracks the saucers. Holy shit that was scary. I'm gonna I'm going to die.

446
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:42,949
I'm going to die. Do I need to come over? I need I need to find help is what needs to happen.

447
00:55:42,949 --> 00:55:46,469
How do you shoot a major pulse cannon and miss every single enemy that are disconnected and

448
00:55:46,469 --> 00:55:55,059
if they did again. Maybe if you were just picking up boxes like I told you to dead.

449
00:55:55,059 --> 00:55:59,059
I'm dead. I'm down. Taleks to your right. We may have another problem.

450
00:55:59,059 --> 00:56:05,880
Taleks is almost down too. Yeah that's why I'm running over to a stir. Star. Star.

451
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:08,760
Yeah I'm right next to him. At least I was like. Can I press you guys?

452
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:17,110
We got annihilated. They're just crashing into each other.

453
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:22,150
They're just smashing into each other. Press the vehicle rescue button. What the

454
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:25,190
fuck is the vehicle rescue button? Look just press every button okay.

455
00:56:26,949 --> 00:56:31,989
Thank you. All right now me. Now give me some heals. Are you in support?

456
00:56:33,769 --> 00:56:40,010
They're just crashing into each other. Thank you. I'm gonna die because you're dead again.

457
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:50,500
Well there is health right there. You just got it. I'm dead. What's the rescue button? It's circled.

458
00:56:50,739 --> 00:56:57,369
Or they will attack civilians destroyed. Yeah we're in a lot of trouble here.

459
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:04,360
Any more health? I can't tell. I did enjoy being alive for an extra 15 seconds.

460
00:57:05,159 --> 00:57:11,340
I get it. Ataleks you're dead in your bed. Excuse me. I'm coming. Wait.

461
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:16,460
Who's being resurrected right now? I'm coming. Not me. What are you talking about?

462
00:57:17,179 --> 00:57:20,059
Then why do you have one HP? I have three.

463
00:57:20,619 --> 00:57:23,579
I'm sorry. Did I get you?

464
00:57:26,619 --> 00:57:37,639
You gotta be in this underhang. Oh I have three health. You actually do just have to be in this

465
00:57:37,639 --> 00:57:44,460
underhang. Yeah it's actually been working really well. I'm coming. So there is friendly fire

466
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:50,139
if you do the explosion on yourself. So are we just gonna just cheese under the fucking sneeze

467
00:57:50,139 --> 00:58:08,739
guard? Okay I see health. I'm going for it in a second. All right I'm back to kind of normal here.

468
00:58:21,769 --> 00:58:25,659
What just happened to me? What did you just do? Did you just shoot a...

469
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:31,670
I just had 75 health and I'm at zero. What happened over there? Fucking guys are on your own.

470
00:58:31,670 --> 00:58:41,260
Because it's your fault. Okay you aggroed all the enemies. If you had been picking up more armor

471
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:46,780
we wouldn't be in this situation. Oh he's shot. I can see them from here. Oh yeah? I don't think

472
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:53,179
we'd get them if we lose the mission. We don't. I'm dead. I'm on the roof too. Good luck getting me.

473
00:58:56,360 --> 00:59:00,360
No one's gonna get me up here. I'm done. Nobody's shot me in a long time so I might just stay here

474
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:09,300
and not come get you. Yeah. Fucking roof. Oh god. I did so much. Figuring it out. I killed myself.

475
00:59:10,659 --> 00:59:19,699
Hang on. Hold on. I got a shield. Welcome to EDF. Can you guys destroy the building behind you?

476
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:25,420
Come to me. All right go find another safe place and blow up this building.

477
00:59:27,989 --> 00:59:32,070
No we're winning the mission. Yeah we kind of... this kind of worked out. You're not gonna beat

478
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:37,269
this. They're starting to get under here. Yeah they're like going. They're surfing on the concrete.

479
00:59:37,269 --> 00:59:45,510
We're gonna beat the mission. Uh no. Remember last game too. The first mission where we started losing

480
00:59:45,510 --> 00:59:54,679
was when they uh all the fucking flying things. Oh yeah I remember. Retreat or restart. Waiting

481
00:59:54,679 --> 01:00:00,119
for the host to make a selection. Yeah retreat or restart. Um just try it again. This time we'll be

482
01:00:00,119 --> 01:00:04,760
prepared. Just get ready for the saucers. I wouldn't mind switching weapons. Oh okay well

483
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:19,000
then we'll switch weapons. I was a bit rushed. Oh well we did get some armor. Yeah that's not

484
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:32,840
that idea. Maybe lightning bow. Lightning bow or that spark vine is good. I think I can just I

485
01:00:33,559 --> 01:00:42,570
I don't know. I'm gonna get the bombers and hope that they do things. This thing is too big. Um

486
01:00:46,500 --> 01:01:01,829
no it's got its use. It does. I want a vehicle drama. So pick it up. Or no you're right hold on.

487
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:13,559
That would be good here. I just got a bunch of zigguns. First one ready. Let the court know.

488
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:22,170
So what'd you guys do on your Sunday? What's today? My Sunday? What'd you guys do on your Wednesday?

489
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:30,099
You realize we live in the same house right? No I'm not. I know what you did today. It's today

490
01:01:30,099 --> 01:01:35,619
Wednesday. Today's Wednesday. What'd you do on this Wednesday? I did a lot of stuff. I cannot

491
01:01:35,619 --> 01:01:41,880
talk about it on the stream. People saying that you're quiet. How is that possible? Speak star.

492
01:01:43,349 --> 01:01:53,420
Speak. I'm speaking. Speak. Speaks. This is an example of speaks. Now Alex you talk. Do it

493
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:58,860
right or I'm coming over there to scream in your mic. I'm gonna be loud and then quiet and this

494
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:02,380
is normal okay. I'm coming over to scream as loud as I can on your mic if you don't do it.

495
01:02:03,349 --> 01:02:11,619
Oh I'm just what did I just do? Oh he did it okay. We're good. Go scream EDF.

496
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:18,940
Oh also we do only have three people. Scream as loud as you can and see if you can hear it on mine.

497
01:02:19,659 --> 01:02:36,889
Let's see if this helps a little. Let's see if it helps. Go peak italics' mic. Oh fuck. Oh fuck.

498
01:02:36,889 --> 01:02:44,820
Hold on. Oh fuck. All right you guys should be good now. Oh fuck. Are you ready? Oh fuck.

499
01:02:45,699 --> 01:02:51,059
What are you doing? I am. I am. I am. But fuck. I'm changing stuff. I'm good. Uh oh. No. Good. Good.

500
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:54,420
Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Everything's good.

501
01:02:54,420 --> 01:03:04,170
I guess I'm a lefty now. Okay so I got the shot. This is going to help a lot. I will take care of

502
01:03:04,170 --> 01:03:12,650
the monsters coming up from the ship. I didn't hit one shot. All you have to do is just like

503
01:03:12,650 --> 01:03:28,300
hit things and also not die. Oh this is definitely the weapon. I'm not even going to equip the other

504
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:36,599
one for any reason. Yeah. I think we just hide under here the whole time to be honest.

505
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:49,980
Start. We're dropping bombs already. Yeah. So if the aliens attack but the air support specialist

506
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:54,780
bombs the entire city anyways. Yeah it goes through them. Did we actually save anything?

507
01:03:56,119 --> 01:04:02,809
Um no I'm bombing the street and the street is fine. That's just uh. Like as long as we hang out

508
01:04:02,809 --> 01:04:07,769
under here and I bomb the street then we're good because they kept bunching up on the streets.

509
01:04:11,449 --> 01:04:17,460
I'm in my own little world over here. You guys have fun. It feels like playing a different video

510
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:30,280
game. Yeah that's that's always how that class feels. Humans. Humans. Uh oh. Uh oh.

511
01:04:31,079 --> 01:04:39,159
I need to recharge for a second. Did he just say if we let them run rampage?

512
01:04:40,039 --> 01:04:50,739
They're gonna run rampant. No he said run rampage. If we let them run rampage.

513
01:04:54,119 --> 01:04:59,610
I don't know if it's such a good idea under here. Oh my. Ow. I don't know if this is a good idea.

514
01:05:02,059 --> 01:05:04,780
Which part? All three of us standing in the same place.

515
01:05:07,699 --> 01:05:13,559
We can risk each other very easily. I'm going out. Don't worry I got knocked back. See that's why

516
01:05:13,559 --> 01:05:19,159
because we just got fucking collateral right there. Well you keep flying around then and just

517
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:25,239
don't get hit. Do you know how hard this is to do in that game? I kind of just have to stand still.

518
01:05:25,239 --> 01:05:37,079
That's a weapon crit I gotta get. That's sort of what I do. Attacked. Oh we just got permission.

519
01:05:37,079 --> 01:05:41,159
I don't know what we've been doing up until now. Attack the flying saucers. Let the government go

520
01:05:41,159 --> 01:05:51,860
ahead. Ow that hurt. I can hear that all the way over here. Good. And it's starting to bug me.

521
01:05:52,579 --> 01:05:59,559
Get it? Oh get it. Do they really just give you like constant news reports?

522
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:07,639
This is like um playing fallout where you get all the like data disks.

523
01:06:12,730 --> 01:06:15,210
This is how they tell their story. We're doing a lot better.

524
01:06:15,210 --> 01:06:25,530
Oh come on man. Don't embarrass me on my own stream. Everything's getting very quiet. Yeah.

525
01:06:26,889 --> 01:06:42,260
I thought I was losing my hearing. Easy. Here come more. You're just singing down here.

526
01:06:44,789 --> 01:06:51,510
Why do I have a different voice every time though? Because you're like Darth Vader. It's muffled in

527
01:06:54,599 --> 01:07:05,960
Oh. Oh no. Oh no guys. What? Are you fine? Are you losing?

528
01:07:11,780 --> 01:07:21,380
Is it your fault we're losing? No. What? There's a med kit. I feel like my deflection shield isn't

529
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:32,070
really deflecting much. Yeah it's because you're. Oh my god. Oh my god. He's not fun for me. I even

530
01:07:32,070 --> 01:07:38,889
have a shield. I'm still dead. Oh my god. I just took so much damage. Oh I died on the

531
01:07:38,889 --> 01:07:48,820
fucking roof again. Oh god damn it. Yeah there this is the wave where it's not possible currently.

532
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:52,739
Well we can run the other missions get more armor and you know maybe get better

533
01:07:53,940 --> 01:08:00,309
equipment. I don't have the best anti-air equipment. That is correct. Get the clean

534
01:08:00,309 --> 01:08:04,789
crates. It was hard when you get out of cover and a hundred ships surround you and you die in three

535
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:16,699
hits. Are you making fun of me? What? No I'm just saying our strategy is flawed. I don't have a

536
01:08:16,699 --> 01:08:26,010
strategy. I think you're. Oh dude yeah I could use the bunker. Standing in the same place but to

537
01:08:26,010 --> 01:08:30,710
spread out. Haven't you guys ever seen harbor before? We don't need to spread out. I have the

538
01:08:30,710 --> 01:08:35,909
electromagnetic bunker. It creates a shield that can't be shot through but we can shoot through.

539
01:08:36,470 --> 01:08:40,310
So it can. And we all just stand in the same spot. Well shut up italics. No one likes you.

540
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:45,000
Whoa no one likes being wrong either apparently.

541
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:54,439
Hold on a second. What did Ashley put in your food earlier?

542
01:08:55,699 --> 01:08:58,500
Poison. It's rat poison. Hold on a minute here.

543
01:09:00,739 --> 01:09:05,460
Hold on. Here guys we're going again. Not rat poison. What do you mean? Wait wait wait listen

544
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:16,810
listen to this listen. We go again. I also have I have a life vendor. You know what that does. It

545
01:09:16,810 --> 01:09:23,609
supplies hit points to my allies. Your voice is very loud and fucked up right now. Why is my voice

546
01:09:23,609 --> 01:09:27,689
fucked up? I don't know. I don't know what you did. You like plugged in a different mic. He's just

547
01:09:27,689 --> 01:09:32,659
leaning in. Can you ready up italics? Why are we doing this again on the same level? Yeah we're

548
01:09:32,659 --> 01:09:40,500
doing it again. We go again. I don't know. I told you this. Listen. They can't shoot us. I have

549
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:48,899
healing. We stand under thing. It's fine. What is exactly what we did last time except there was a

550
01:09:48,899 --> 01:09:55,579
healing item. You're gonna be in big trouble after this. The barrier and the healing. What do you mean

551
01:09:55,579 --> 01:10:06,329
we go? I'm ready. If we lose this time it's just probably italics. No it would be you actually

552
01:10:06,409 --> 01:10:13,210
because. Will it be you? You're the one that we're depending on. Will it be me or will it be me?

553
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:26,569
Nice whiffs man. Okay when it gets to that phase we all have to we go under the thing.

554
01:10:27,210 --> 01:10:32,949
Okay get to the phase go in the thing. Get to the phase go in the thing. Dude this is

555
01:10:32,949 --> 01:10:39,819
on normal difficulty too. You understand? I understand this is normal. I understand we're

556
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:47,350
missing a player because you don't have any friends. Wait is that some kind of jab?

557
01:10:47,909 --> 01:10:54,069
There are two players currently here in the same household. So where's your second? Because there's

558
01:10:54,069 --> 01:11:01,399
a plus one invitation. I invited you and German didn't invite anyone. Was I supposed to invite

559
01:11:01,399 --> 01:11:08,859
somebody else? Okay okay let's get under. Everyone under. We're gonna test the strat. I don't know

560
01:11:08,859 --> 01:11:13,739
how this gets deployed. I can't wait until we all die. God that's it. Yeah great girl. It was

561
01:11:13,739 --> 01:11:19,180
actually I who invited you by the way. Just so we're clear. Can we shoot through this? Yes.

562
01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:32,060
All right this stupid strategy is gonna work. How often do you put those down? How long does

563
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:37,020
shield last for I guess? I have no idea. I have to get out there and pick up stuff though every

564
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:41,819
on a periodic basis. Well once it ends all the stuff to pick up is gonna be out here.

565
01:11:42,779 --> 01:11:48,619
All right one shield down. We're gonna someone's gonna blow up. I'm gonna kill us. I can already

566
01:11:48,619 --> 01:11:53,909
guarantee it. I gotta get out of here. I can't stay near you guys. You claustrophobic or something?

567
01:11:53,909 --> 01:12:01,539
No I have like explosives. What's what? Why don't you have one over here? Hey what the fuck?

568
01:12:01,539 --> 01:12:08,149
Got destroyed and I can't place anymore. Here have a have a heal. I put the heal. What do you mean a heal?

569
01:12:09,109 --> 01:12:14,779
I put the heal drone thing down. There's green. Why do you why do you why have you know you've

570
01:12:14,779 --> 01:12:18,699
been using that since the very beginning? That's a great one. I was using artillery

571
01:12:19,420 --> 01:12:23,819
and it's more fun. I don't want to be the fucking support for you. Interesting you picked a class

572
01:12:23,819 --> 01:12:30,460
called air support. Yeah and I have nothing that comes from the air. Also it's called air raider.

573
01:12:30,859 --> 01:12:40,920
Whoa raid my health bar. Whoa that's what you should be doing not raiding the ground.

574
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:55,060
All right I don't know how I get more barriers. This is my chance to get some stuff. I might have

575
01:12:55,060 --> 01:13:06,140
to pick up like a weapon box to get more I don't know. It doesn't oh I do press reload on it and

576
01:13:06,140 --> 01:13:14,060
then they'll go away. Well I'm not gonna have them for a while. Oh no you're not? Okay well

577
01:13:14,060 --> 01:13:21,500
then this strategy yeah what's your cooldown on the on the deflection? It's like 20 percent

578
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:25,100
reloaded. Here comes the big wave I think. I still have more health I can put down. Yeah I

579
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:29,420
think this is the big one. It's incoming in a second. How?

580
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:36,760
All right here it is. I hope you guys are prepared. I'm blocking this guy on the left.

581
01:13:37,899 --> 01:13:49,029
Oh my lord. All right here it comes. I'm so scared. Don't worry this is easy. This is the easier

582
01:13:49,029 --> 01:13:53,189
mission because there's so many you can't miss. Did you switch the difficulty for the

583
01:13:54,149 --> 01:14:04,949
oh shit and we have we have the healing station still up. Powerful countries attacking us Jerma.

584
01:14:06,899 --> 01:14:16,359
Ow. Keep it up. It's almost I almost have barriers. Good because we're gonna need them.

585
01:14:17,479 --> 01:14:25,539
Oh god. It's pretty good for my shotgun because they're right on top of us. I don't know if I'm

586
01:14:25,539 --> 01:14:32,649
hurting myself or they're hurting me. Oh no I got some down. I got some down. Awful.

587
01:14:38,039 --> 01:14:43,640
You guys aren't even using them. Get behind my shield. I see it. Get behind my shield. Move

588
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:49,159
with the grace of someone wearing perpetual ice skates. I do best Reinhardt impression. Go

589
01:14:49,159 --> 01:14:58,550
italics now. No. Stir. Overwatch sucks. I can't. What are we doing? Why are we?

590
01:14:59,670 --> 01:15:02,310
It's trying to show us the new thing but we're all dying.

591
01:15:02,710 --> 01:15:04,869
All right I'll go.

592
01:15:09,989 --> 01:15:17,720
That could have been like a lot of characters.

593
01:15:20,420 --> 01:15:23,779
The silence is what's getting me right now. All right I gotta get that. I'm focused.

594
01:15:27,829 --> 01:15:33,399
Retreat. That means we did it. We did it. I can't. It's too green.

595
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:40,550
Why is there a nuke? The building's gone.

596
01:15:41,430 --> 01:15:46,710
What? The building's gone. Our only source of cover just vanished. Hey there's no doubt they're

597
01:15:46,710 --> 01:15:59,960
aliens guys. Any green crates today? I'm trying to get the fucking crates. You guys are laughing

598
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:07,619
having a laugh at about it a little bit over here. I'm trying to collect boxes. I don't think it's

599
01:16:07,619 --> 01:16:15,460
over. No it just got way harder. We gotta find a new building. Yeah we gotta change position here.

600
01:16:16,789 --> 01:16:23,930
You're dead? Yeah. Oh boy. Hold on. I'm coming. I was boosting as fast as I could to keep up.

601
01:16:24,649 --> 01:16:43,180
Does that take health from me? I think it does. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. If I put my back to another

602
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:49,770
building I have more bunkers. I'm almost dead again. I got you if you do. Trying to just stay

603
01:16:49,770 --> 01:17:05,449
close. Hostile forces. No way. I can't believe they're trying to kill us. Do you have a heal?

604
01:17:06,250 --> 01:17:10,090
I don't. I can't do any more heals. There's a couple boxes. That would be very convenient.

605
01:17:10,729 --> 01:17:19,609
Where are they? Like on the road there's some. Heals? Yeah there's a couple here. Well

606
01:17:21,210 --> 01:17:24,569
if I could move faster than five miles an hour I would love to get. That's the worst part about

607
01:17:24,569 --> 01:17:29,539
the character you're playing. Holy shit that takes half my health. Yeah you have to split

608
01:17:29,539 --> 01:17:33,380
your health with me so I'm just a liability right now. Oh look at this. Find some cover.

609
01:17:33,380 --> 01:17:36,340
Look at how many are here. We need to find a way out of here.

610
01:17:38,229 --> 01:17:48,460
Holy shit. I'm stuck on a rock. Star any right ideas? I'm trying to get to a shield.

611
01:17:49,340 --> 01:18:00,890
He's got super shield over here. Oh help. My health. Oh shield's already down. I don't know dude.

612
01:18:04,170 --> 01:18:10,329
Yeah there's health right next to me actually. I'm down. It's just germabot. Yeah there's a health

613
01:18:10,329 --> 01:18:23,960
box right next to me and there's a health box in front of star. Oh okay. All right just don't

614
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:32,699
pick me up. Your health is better spent like right now shooting things. Holy fuck. Are we

615
01:18:32,699 --> 01:18:39,750
getting reinforcement? They're talking about reinforcing us? I don't even know what to shoot

616
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:52,470
at. There's so many. Oh boy this is where I die. This is where it's all gone. Holy shit. I'm dead.

617
01:18:54,619 --> 01:18:58,220
I didn't actually mean to say thank you. My headphone hit it. It's just you man.

618
01:18:59,020 --> 01:19:07,180
Well this is easy. I have no way I lose this. Ah there's a health crate. I'm in. I walk inside of a

619
01:19:07,180 --> 01:19:18,300
ship. I think we hit the gear. I think we hit the gear check mission. We did get at least some more

620
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:27,109
armor. We did it. BMing. No I accidentally touched. Because we're still like finding loot and stuff

621
01:19:27,189 --> 01:19:31,750
right. So you just get a portion of the shields that are better to shield cancel for movement

622
01:19:31,750 --> 01:19:37,109
than others. I mean you can always go back and we can do another one and get better. I like still

623
01:19:37,109 --> 01:19:46,170
don't have a vehicle. Dragon Lance. Interesting. Single shot great damage however it requires

624
01:19:46,170 --> 01:19:54,409
several times the energy of a standard power lance. Longer charge time. Okay might be worth

625
01:19:54,409 --> 01:20:29,050
using. Bolt gun. Okay let's see. What did we get? This one. I should probably mute. Everyone else

626
01:20:29,050 --> 01:20:32,890
is muted. All right. Bolt gun. What to do. New type of gun that fires multiple electric bolts. I want a vehicle.

627
01:20:39,619 --> 01:20:51,909
Bolt gun and then dragon lance. Um maybe we should try the dragon lance. High output. Look at that

628
01:20:51,909 --> 01:21:06,100
thing. It's like a drill. Try it. All right. I'm ready. Are we doing an older mission? What are we

629
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:12,020
doing? We should probably just let's go back to the last mission. And so. Can you do the last mission on heart?

630
01:21:12,020 --> 01:21:19,500
That they fixed my dash cancel and it doesn't work anymore. I heard people saying that earlier.

631
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:27,109
Um we can do that mission on easy and then just keep playing. On easy? But don't we want to do

632
01:21:27,109 --> 01:21:30,869
you want to do it on easy? Do you want to go back and do one of the missions on heart? I kind of

633
01:21:30,869 --> 01:21:37,989
just want to progress. Also yeah I mean usually before you could do like the first mission on

634
01:21:37,989 --> 01:21:44,600
heart and get higher level stuff. I think that that's still the case isn't it? Probably. Want to

635
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:49,640
try that? You want to go back a mission and just do it on heart? But usually I think like in normal

636
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:55,720
in normal difficulty there's a there's a weapon level cap of like you can't use high level

637
01:21:55,720 --> 01:22:00,119
shit in normal. Yeah it might be. But some sometimes here we're gonna we're gonna do it.

638
01:22:01,939 --> 01:22:09,989
We're gonna we're gonna do it. Hey naked face game. This is the uh all the little bugs are

639
01:22:09,989 --> 01:22:30,300
gonna rush us. So I'm gonna change my shit. So how the heck are you? Me I'm good. I'm ready.

640
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:40,100
Waiting for italics. So this is the last mission on heart. No this is one of the first missions on

641
01:22:40,100 --> 01:22:45,220
heart. Please don't tell me this is the corridor mission. No not that one the one after that one

642
01:22:45,220 --> 01:22:49,060
because the corridor mission is stupid. So well what kind of support equipment do we eventually get?

643
01:22:49,779 --> 01:22:57,020
I have like two empty support slots for example. Um I don't for fence fence or I don't know. Yeah

644
01:22:57,020 --> 01:23:07,300
I don't remember them having support. All right let's try the bolt gun. Oh okay. Oh you're hurting

645
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:13,460
me. I am. Oh it's this guy. EDF teaches you pretty early on to go back and farm now that repeated

646
01:23:13,460 --> 01:23:18,500
weapons get upgraded. So I guess if you find the same weapon again it upgrades. That's cool.

647
01:23:20,409 --> 01:23:27,029
All right so uh I guess two auto cannons is better than one. Oh this this thing is actually

648
01:23:27,029 --> 01:23:36,199
really great. It's a great single target weapon. Dragonlance was a good choice. Whoever suggested

649
01:23:36,199 --> 01:23:43,430
it thanks for the suggestion. It doesn't go that far though. It's still in normal? What?

650
01:23:44,069 --> 01:23:48,569
Did you not change it? I definitely set it to hard. Did you confirm it? I don't know how you

651
01:23:48,569 --> 01:24:01,800
could tell that it's still in normal. I'm not seeing very many crates. It's so slow. These are

652
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:14,060
so heavy. Wait what? It says there's one right here but there's not. Oh boy. Well I'm just getting

653
01:24:14,060 --> 01:24:23,979
the armor. All right well there's a weapon crate. Well this definitely doesn't feel harder.

654
01:24:32,439 --> 01:24:42,890
Does this go through everybody? I think it only goes into one person. Yeah it does.

655
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:49,180
It does but I am collecting.

656
01:24:56,039 --> 01:25:02,920
This thing. I'd rather just use the other lightning gun. Wait why are our combat suits

657
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:09,399
acid resistant? I wonder if we ever had to deal with acid things before. Listen acid. It's in the lore.

658
01:25:11,319 --> 01:25:14,600
I don't think so. Wait they're not. What? How do they not.

659
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:28,869
There's a weapon over here. It's so hard to aim. You don't see it anywhere to buy? Yeah for some

660
01:25:28,869 --> 01:25:32,310
weird reason. This game is not featured anywhere on the PlayStation Store. You have to go looking.

661
01:25:32,310 --> 01:25:39,220
No you have to like look for it. You can like purposefully search it. Oh god in 2018 you have

662
01:25:39,220 --> 01:25:43,939
to search for your game. Well I mean you actually have to go into like all games. Actually though

663
01:25:43,939 --> 01:25:47,779
if you go to the Epic game store then there's no search bar so I think they're figuring it out.

664
01:25:47,779 --> 01:25:54,340
That's 2018. You shouldn't have to search for games anymore. What's with what's with this?

665
01:25:55,939 --> 01:26:01,930
I don't want to talk about stores. I want to talk about monsters to shoot with our monster guns.

666
01:26:07,479 --> 01:26:13,189
All right basically no one buy this game. That guy just come on comments and say it's okay if

667
01:26:13,189 --> 01:26:20,739
you're a civilian. What? All right I'm searching. I'm searching. Scanning the area. I'm scanning. I

668
01:26:20,739 --> 01:26:34,500
see one red box. I can't wait to get a good view of this. Look at this one. Nice dude. I want to

669
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:39,060
see a I want to see a mock-up of like who got the most kills. A mock-up. You don't want to see that.

670
01:26:39,939 --> 01:26:46,579
You'd be very disappointed because it's not you think it's you it's the destiny not me.

671
01:26:46,579 --> 01:26:52,869
It's going to be a talent. What? What are you talking about? Oh dude I'm gonna mock up. We're

672
01:26:52,869 --> 01:26:57,189
talking about the Epic game store and how. Excuse me I thought we were not talking about game stores.

673
01:26:58,149 --> 01:27:03,430
Yeah you just said that. Yeah you did just say that. Well we're talking about Epic games.

674
01:27:04,630 --> 01:27:09,819
You guys know that I installed Fortnite yesterday and opened it to the menu. Doesn't it make you

675
01:27:09,819 --> 01:27:15,979
install Fortnite? I did. Why? Because every time I died in Hotline Miami I was going to play around

676
01:27:15,979 --> 01:27:25,180
to Fortnite. Oh. And then I kept getting very I died like 335 times. That's a lot of Fortnite games.

677
01:27:25,180 --> 01:27:30,619
Yeah that was a lot. It was a lot. The stream was like 65 days long. Oh you're the W. God I

678
01:27:30,619 --> 01:27:36,220
thought the W was weapon. Hang on. Fortnite and W is in the same sentence? Excuse me. What? What

679
01:27:36,220 --> 01:27:43,340
stream am I on? What are you talking about? On the map for me you're a W. W. You are a W.

680
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:51,579
Star is an A. Oh yes. I'm not even on the map. No you're an F. F. That's that's accurate. So he's

681
01:27:51,579 --> 01:28:01,500
the A for A student. F for F student and then W for weirdo. Can you please not? You said today

682
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:06,220
you were going to be good. I did say that. I did say I was going to be like good today. What is good?

683
01:28:06,220 --> 01:28:09,659
No I didn't. I didn't fucking say that. I'm not even going to perpetuate that bullshit. I didn't

684
01:28:09,659 --> 01:28:22,680
say anything. You just lied twice. Don't you know that 85% of everything I ever say on stream is not

685
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:29,079
true. We've already talked about this. Is that true? I don't know. Is that in the 15%? I don't

686
01:28:29,079 --> 01:28:39,180
know. You have to figure that out. So is this part of the ask me anything? Could be. It is now.

687
01:28:39,739 --> 01:28:48,119
No I'm not going to go peek at Alex's mic. So how much truth are you doing right now? Is that a lie

688
01:28:48,119 --> 01:28:56,920
too? You need to watch Interstellar. Hey don't spoil that movie. I haven't seen it. I'm going

689
01:28:56,920 --> 01:29:05,529
to change your parameters. Holy shit there's so many things over there. Get it. Got it.

690
01:29:08,710 --> 01:29:12,949
Okay there we go. Now that's what I'm talking about. Mad weapons. Mad weapons.

691
01:29:13,750 --> 01:29:26,149
Yeah I got a bunch of the same shit. Mirage zero. Homing weapon. Leveled up. All right that's pretty

692
01:29:26,149 --> 01:29:36,220
good. Turbo core. Level up. Yeah you have to click apply settings when you change the difficulty.

693
01:29:39,369 --> 01:29:42,010
Spark mine level up. Energy cost is down. That's good.

694
01:29:42,010 --> 01:29:47,050
Why? More capacity. Lot more capacity for the machine gun. So do you want to try and do that

695
01:29:47,050 --> 01:29:54,659
on hard or no? We could. Okay I'm putting on hard and I'm applying the setting. Also this means

696
01:29:54,659 --> 01:30:06,760
there's friendly fire now. Okay which mission is this? Sorry. It's the same one we just did.

697
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:24,470
Okay so interesting. All land based. Grenade. Bolt gun I'm not a fan of. Maybe when it's upgraded

698
01:30:24,470 --> 01:30:34,840
it's better. Oh I feel like this would be not. Looks like we're waiting on a couple other people

699
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:41,670
to ready up right now. Yeah but hold on. Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. Yeah I'm gonna

700
01:30:41,670 --> 01:30:47,239
kill you guys. What? What the fuck are you talking about? All three of my equipment are artillery.

701
01:30:47,239 --> 01:30:55,460
Oh fuck. Do I get like a friendly fire on in hard? It shows you and then you can move. Okay

702
01:30:55,539 --> 01:31:00,600
That was just that was really that was a weird way to start that. I'm gonna go kill you guys.

703
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:15,060
I'm gonna kill you guys. Stop. Stop this. I'm the one that's supposed to be good today. What?

704
01:31:15,060 --> 01:31:18,899
What does it have to do with anything? You get you both are talking about killing me.

705
01:31:20,659 --> 01:31:26,060
Yeah well you haven't been very good. There's only one of us that would actually do that though.

706
01:31:28,279 --> 01:31:38,600
Whoa. And it's not me. But I you know I don't have motive but I do have opportunity.

707
01:31:39,399 --> 01:31:44,119
Oh I accidentally did the other one. What do you mean the accident? What'd you accidentally do?

708
01:31:44,119 --> 01:31:50,279
I had moved the mission forward and I didn't I didn't approve of it. Why are you doing these

709
01:31:50,279 --> 01:32:01,420
schools? Are we restarting? No. I wish I could shoot my Gatling at the same time as the mortar.

710
01:32:02,619 --> 01:32:05,739
Because I should be able to destroy these pretty easily with the shit I have.

711
01:32:07,850 --> 01:32:19,640
Well yay. Actually I kind of don't mind. This is really this is really just brainless gun.

712
01:32:20,279 --> 01:32:25,380
It just locks on and homings. It's a matter of class weapons.

713
01:32:29,239 --> 01:32:37,909
So do weapon boxes actually appear on the minimap or do you just have to spot them?

714
01:32:37,909 --> 01:32:42,869
They appear on the ground. That's I know they're on the ground. I'm asking if

715
01:32:42,869 --> 01:32:48,710
okay well you think maybe the green dots are you were jokingly saying I'm going to kill you but

716
01:32:48,710 --> 01:32:57,319
you did. I didn't mean to. You bet you did. And that did not last very long. So I wonder

717
01:32:57,319 --> 01:33:04,789
is Star the one that's killing us? No I'm the one that's winning the mission. You have heals anymore?

718
01:33:06,229 --> 01:33:15,819
No. Oh I guess I'll just die though. I just got I just landed on my neck.

719
01:33:15,979 --> 01:33:18,220
I just got blown up by your extreme explosion.

720
01:33:18,859 --> 01:33:23,420
All you gotta do is not stand next to the pylon. Hey all you gotta do is not lay it down on top

721
01:33:23,420 --> 01:33:27,979
of our name tag which is visible across the entire map. I'm not. I keep throwing them on the pylon.

722
01:33:27,979 --> 01:33:32,779
Fucking boober. All right pick me up. I'm picking up the weapon chest.

723
01:33:35,420 --> 01:33:37,020
No I think we get shit even if we fail.

724
01:33:37,020 --> 01:33:47,590
Don't die forehead. Just don't die forehead. Let me get full health and I'll come rescue you.

725
01:33:48,899 --> 01:33:59,180
I can't damage these myself. I like only have artillery. I'm trying to get as many things as

726
01:33:59,180 --> 01:34:05,399
I can. I think even if we die we get them because last time where when we failed that um

727
01:34:06,359 --> 01:34:15,189
the air the ufo one we still got shit. I just need like a second. Boom. All right I'm just

728
01:34:15,189 --> 01:34:20,329
gonna stay up here for a second and just take a look. Any more crates? I can get down over

729
01:34:20,329 --> 01:34:27,689
the pylon. Just crates. I'm gonna try to get some. Singular ants can kill me. Yeah they do a lot of

730
01:34:27,689 --> 01:34:36,939
damage because it's hard. Okay I don't have a cool guy dodge roll. I have just I jump one time. Be

731
01:34:36,939 --> 01:34:54,409
aware of that happening. Oh my god. Okay are you doing it again? No okay. Jeez Louise man. If you

732
01:34:54,409 --> 01:35:01,210
want me to I can. All right I'm dying over here. I'm coming back there now. I had to pick up stuff

733
01:35:01,210 --> 01:35:06,329
with the pylon. Oh what? Walking dead episode. What the fuck are you doing? What? You just panicked

734
01:35:06,329 --> 01:35:14,979
me. You panicked me. You maybe pressed my button and I fucking hurt myself. I meant to cancel the

735
01:35:14,979 --> 01:35:30,470
throw but it doesn't. It didn't. Stop calling me a civilian. All right are we okay? No. No there's a

736
01:35:30,470 --> 01:35:37,050
bunch of ants coming at me. Well do something about it. I don't have any guns. I'm a civilian.

737
01:35:38,010 --> 01:35:48,979
Yeah are you actually? Oh baby. You just laser yourself. Yeah. I'm just gonna hide in this bush.

738
01:35:51,159 --> 01:36:00,649
I'm almost out of power. I'm out of power. I need more power. Can you kill like one thing?

739
01:36:00,649 --> 01:36:04,010
You don't understand. It's very hard for me to do what I'm doing right now.

740
01:36:05,579 --> 01:36:09,819
I have to wait. If you kill one thing I get more bombs. I mean yes I did. I killed five

741
01:36:10,699 --> 01:36:18,470
okay and now it's gonna kill me. No don't. Oh I see. That's why I can't dash or jump because

742
01:36:18,470 --> 01:36:25,340
those are my support items I have yet to unlock. I'm just gonna break my fucking controller in my

743
01:36:25,340 --> 01:36:37,029
bare hands. Do we get any items? We did. All right look at these though. That's a level two

744
01:36:37,670 --> 01:36:48,840
pulse machine gun R. Yeah I didn't really get anything good for me. Same shit. Look at that.

745
01:36:51,460 --> 01:37:06,619
Smaller range but better. Pulse machine gun R. R for really good. The big cannon is kind of hard

746
01:37:06,619 --> 01:37:17,960
to use. Yeah look at this. This is a huge increase. Nine damage to twelve faster rate of fire. Okay

747
01:37:17,960 --> 01:37:30,060
we're doing the not pile on one on hard. I feel like I'd rather just use the let me see what this

748
01:37:30,060 --> 01:37:43,380
thing does. I think I'm just yeah I'm just gonna keep shields on permanently. I'll go back to the

749
01:37:43,380 --> 01:37:57,020
shotgun. Yeah shotgun seems pretty decent here actually. I also have one. Jerma should play

750
01:37:57,020 --> 01:38:12,140
Dante must die. DMC. Oh did you hear the drama about the new devil may cry? No I did not. What

751
01:38:12,140 --> 01:38:19,159
drama? I don't think there is any. Well let's make some. Wait hold on you you're just making that up.

752
01:38:20,899 --> 01:38:25,619
Well there's this really weird intro sequence like scene where he just starts like slapping

753
01:38:25,619 --> 01:38:34,819
women and saying like really sexist things. What's wrong with your brain? What's wrong with Dante?

754
01:38:36,020 --> 01:38:50,520
That's a great question. I hope that team ninja answers for this. All right here we go.

755
01:38:56,140 --> 01:39:05,720
All right grit shot. I can hear that. Let me see if I can hear again. I could I could hear that.

756
01:39:05,720 --> 01:39:12,439
Like they say only people under a certain age can hear that noise. Only dogs. Dogs are if you're

757
01:39:12,439 --> 01:39:18,659
young enough you can hear that. Dogs. All right I'm gonna do something tell me if your dog does

758
01:39:18,659 --> 01:39:27,939
anything. I'm gonna put that as my ringtone during class. I'm gonna try and not kill you.

759
01:39:28,500 --> 01:39:36,460
Please don't. That is what set me down the death spiral last time. This thing's actually pretty

760
01:39:36,460 --> 01:39:49,220
effective. Look at the boxes. Fobos. Fobos. What? There's a bunch of weapon crates over here.

761
01:39:49,939 --> 01:39:53,380
I'm going around collecting them. Okay I'm bombing these guys.

762
01:39:56,039 --> 01:39:58,199
All right I'm staying near you because I don't think you'll bomb yourself.

763
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:07,029
I mean he would. He already did it. He did already do that. Did he bomb himself? Oh yeah.

764
01:40:08,069 --> 01:40:14,310
Yes he did last mission. No it shows you. I actually I did last mission. Yes he did. That

765
01:40:14,310 --> 01:40:33,050
was an accident. So it happened at least once. Hold on I see a weapon. All right collecting.

766
01:40:34,390 --> 01:40:41,930
Two weapons. No I want them. Okay can you guys kill these ants? Like these dinosaurs?

767
01:40:42,010 --> 01:40:50,300
Oh yep yep yep yep yep. I'll try. I'm calling you. Oh god that poor guy.

768
01:40:51,659 --> 01:40:58,140
Shit I'm right. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. Oh my god this is not what I'm aiming at.

769
01:40:58,939 --> 01:41:07,239
Oh you're dead dead. Watch out I'm bombing you. Maybe actually good. Maybe that'll knock me over

770
01:41:07,239 --> 01:41:14,420
to near a tower. You're just stealing all the guns. It's sharing. I am putting myself. See it

771
01:41:14,420 --> 01:41:21,020
helped. I'm putting myself in harm's way to get all the items. I'm coming. And then I get bonked.

772
01:41:21,909 --> 01:41:32,279
Oh I almost shot you. I may have shot you. All right I'm here. Someone just said I'm good.

773
01:41:32,279 --> 01:41:42,199
I want you guys to know that. I mean you are but you you are good but like yeah only only at very

774
01:41:42,199 --> 01:41:53,220
specific things. Like what? Table tennis. You were good at table tennis. You are? That's about it.

775
01:41:56,920 --> 01:42:19,130
I heard that. I heard that. Okay easy. Anything over there? Yeah they survived through my earth

776
01:42:19,130 --> 01:42:33,579
right. Oh boy. Oh jeez. Oh boy. Oh jeez. There are too many enemies. I would agree.

777
01:42:46,489 --> 01:43:02,100
I gotta stay in the air. I'm also trying to stay in the air. I got another. Okay it's time to do

778
01:43:02,100 --> 01:43:16,699
or die. Are you bombing yourself? Yes. That's a sun suit tactic. God damn it. God. Danger close.

779
01:43:17,500 --> 01:43:25,420
I'm coming. This is danger close. I feel like this game's harder than last game. Personally.

780
01:43:26,140 --> 01:43:34,489
Oh my god. I got you. Get up. Because we need. We need you. I'm dead. I distracted a bunch of

781
01:43:34,489 --> 01:43:39,590
them though. Now they're all coming for you. Sweet. Hold on. I can still get stuff.

782
01:43:41,590 --> 01:43:54,199
Yeah just pick stuff up. They're all coming over here. All right. Just pick up as much as you can

783
01:43:54,199 --> 01:44:00,340
then die. I have an idea though. What if I bring them all over here? And then we're going to go

784
01:44:00,340 --> 01:44:13,159
for it. Here we go. Ready. Hold on. We're ready. Oh this is not going to take long to just die

785
01:44:13,159 --> 01:44:23,529
again. Yep. Welcome back. Red wizard. And then don't worry about me for a second. Welcome back.

786
01:44:26,729 --> 01:44:33,529
Is playing a man down change the spawn or no? Like are we playing a four player tuned? Yeah

787
01:44:33,529 --> 01:44:38,739
we're playing a man down and nothing changes because of that. Oh yeah I guess that helps

788
01:44:38,739 --> 01:44:44,310
explain. Any more items? It's like seeing a monster hunt a world without the cats.

789
01:44:47,579 --> 01:45:00,329
I see that explosion about to happen. Is that done? Is the explosion over? Yeah you'll see

790
01:45:00,329 --> 01:45:09,670
the red on the ground. I'm sorry. Oh my god. I mean if you just fly forever you should be able

791
01:45:09,670 --> 01:45:15,800
to kill them eventually. That's true. This is the last wave I have. Yeah this does seem like the

792
01:45:15,800 --> 01:45:21,640
final wave. You just have to get good. I'm handling things don't worry. Do you want to

793
01:45:21,640 --> 01:45:25,720
resurrect anybody? Just so you have to stay good. Oh they're up on the building.

794
01:45:28,420 --> 01:45:43,670
I can still like see the vomit of projectiles. God damn it. Stop singing. You're covering my

795
01:45:43,670 --> 01:45:52,260
screen with like fucking notifications. You've got like annotations all over my screen and it's

796
01:45:52,260 --> 01:46:07,289
fucking me up. There's cheese puffs following you. God. Yeah. You got this. I need to wait. I need

797
01:46:07,289 --> 01:46:19,210
to get. Look just don't get hit. Oh no what did I do? Mistake. Mistake. Mistake. Mistake. Mistake.

798
01:46:21,029 --> 01:46:29,029
Mistake. Oh I like playing this game with the soundboard enabled by default. You just jump by

799
01:46:29,029 --> 01:46:34,359
me. Look how much health you got. How many times did I say help me? And you just go right by me.

800
01:46:34,359 --> 01:46:38,600
Yeah don't res me. Res him. He can call down an airstrike. Do you want to be resurrected?

801
01:46:39,159 --> 01:46:43,000
I thought I was supposed to just run away and kill them. There was no reason not to get me

802
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:53,619
up. Okay well then fucking there we go. One two three. I panicked. Hold on. Let's count to three

803
01:46:53,619 --> 01:47:27,140
again. One. Listen help me too. Two. Three. Do it. Help me. Oh nice airstrike. Look at all those

804
01:47:27,140 --> 01:47:35,590
ants get demolished. How many more people are left? Dude I am the GPS. I can get you. I can get you.

805
01:47:36,470 --> 01:47:50,390
All right. Where the fuck are you? Oh you're. Oh I'm over here. Hey what's up? Oh I'm down again.

806
01:47:50,390 --> 01:47:53,189
But there's like there's not very much. I'll be down again in about two seconds as well.

807
01:47:53,909 --> 01:47:59,829
There's only like six. There's seven. There's seven. Don't put pressure on me. Save this like

808
01:47:59,829 --> 01:48:10,970
a hundred. There's a hundred. You have to res me. Okay I'll get you. No fuck this. Let me prove

809
01:48:10,970 --> 01:48:31,739
that I'm capable. Quiet. That's no noise. Oh my god I'm losing my mind. You can just do it.

810
01:48:31,739 --> 01:48:40,739
Just get over here. Both of you. I don't even care. Wow that was that was like an anime

811
01:48:40,739 --> 01:48:51,460
resurrection. You just whizzed by me. It was crazy. All right well I have a shotgun and a mortar so.

812
01:48:52,260 --> 01:48:54,890
All right I'm coming. I think you did it. Oh no.

813
01:48:54,890 --> 01:48:56,890
No.

814
01:49:00,329 --> 01:49:07,289
There's another wave. Oh god. No. There's it's the double wave. It's like the super wave. I'm

815
01:49:07,289 --> 01:49:18,869
going. I'm running away. I'm going on a building. Oh no. I'm making my last stand. Oh my god.

816
01:49:19,750 --> 01:49:33,720
What the fuck have I done? Well the mechs are online or whatever that's worth.

817
01:49:35,640 --> 01:49:38,199
All right hold on. Hold on. This is this might not be terrible.

818
01:49:40,420 --> 01:49:43,859
There is a health pack right next to me as well. Okay hold on. Oh my god. What.

819
01:49:44,500 --> 01:49:56,460
I have the wrong thing. Health pack right next to you Tox. Yeah coming in. Honestly then I get my

820
01:49:57,100 --> 01:50:01,739
artillery back when things die. So because there were more things I could just I just spammed them.

821
01:50:02,380 --> 01:50:08,840
We did it. Oh fuck. I see a weapon. Get me. I can't get it. What the fuck.

822
01:50:09,640 --> 01:50:18,329
Three weapons. Did I get it? Oh I almost pulled my whole monitor down. Level five items.

823
01:50:18,329 --> 01:50:24,569
I got powered exoskeletons. We're good now. We did it. Atalix. High five Atalix. You did it.

824
01:50:25,289 --> 01:50:30,789
You did it Atalix. Okay but now we have better stuff. Like you couldn't have won without me

825
01:50:30,789 --> 01:50:38,250
distracting half the enemies for the two seconds it took me to die each time. You might consider

826
01:50:38,250 --> 01:50:44,579
switching to ranger just because like fencers are so you need to like people are saying you get

827
01:50:44,579 --> 01:50:49,060
you get movement things on your support options later well what did you just get because you

828
01:50:49,060 --> 01:50:54,979
should have got some higher level stuff for um special i did get enhanced boosters add booster

829
01:50:54,979 --> 01:51:08,680
one well it sounds good atalix that's a lot better better version of the post machine gun

830
01:51:08,680 --> 01:51:16,789
are the thing we were just using better though if you do want to play ranger i can also summon

831
01:51:17,750 --> 01:51:25,210
a exoskeleton you can try it now that kind of sounds fun top secret super weapon its very

832
01:51:25,210 --> 01:51:41,770
existence is classified there's oh i think i want that oh that's better in the core that's called b

833
01:51:43,819 --> 01:51:47,819
are we doing the aerial mission again or want to do another one on hard or something

834
01:51:48,779 --> 01:51:58,180
you want to try the one we just did a bacon discharger discharges cooked bacon okay so same

835
01:51:58,180 --> 01:52:06,550
mission did you say bacon launcher yeah can i get a confirmation same mission i'm trying to decide

836
01:52:06,550 --> 01:52:12,789
if i want to switch classes yeah let's give him a second figure that out because i have one extra

837
01:52:12,789 --> 01:52:17,590
booster is there really going to be like the difference maker in my whole class well what was

838
01:52:17,909 --> 01:52:23,189
your the other stuff you've leveled up did you get better for that mission i only got like a

839
01:52:23,189 --> 01:52:33,350
i got a level five shield and add one booster um yeah i don't know switch play ranger okay

840
01:52:34,890 --> 01:52:40,659
i wonder what i should use right now well then yeah we can do the same mission i can summon you

841
01:52:40,659 --> 01:52:54,220
the mech and you can play ranger lightning bow 100 per second things are better across the board

842
01:52:55,020 --> 01:53:04,069
let's try the super weapon and then their upgraded lighting bill i wonder how cool this thing is

843
01:53:04,710 --> 01:53:14,470
oh shit that does so much more damage i was like i don't want to use some dumb limpid gun but it's

844
01:53:14,470 --> 01:53:26,970
like a level three and does so much more than everything else i'm ready yeah are you going to

845
01:53:26,970 --> 01:53:33,130
try ranger it doesn't hurt just to try it for one mission yeah it really it's a lot of um

846
01:53:34,010 --> 01:53:39,369
like projectile explosives rocket launchers grenades that type of stuff machine guns

847
01:53:40,569 --> 01:53:48,979
as some of their weapons are okay but they're basic it's a very balanced basic class that has

848
01:53:48,979 --> 01:53:54,659
good weapons you know the fencer is oh wow dash around you got your huge you have these big

849
01:53:54,659 --> 01:54:01,699
arm cannons and lances you get to fly if you play the the wing diver the air raider vehicles and

850
01:54:01,699 --> 01:54:14,979
big explosions rangers just i have weapons and i shoot them and i'm that's it all right let's

851
01:54:15,460 --> 01:54:20,520
you can just ride my mech you can just do that the whole mission okay we'll give it a try because

852
01:54:20,520 --> 01:54:26,279
it's a level five mech i'll be able to actually walk without um ice skating oh no this thing is

853
01:54:26,279 --> 01:54:34,659
going to be slow as hell yeah you guys but you come on you got to put like whooshes in the middle

854
01:54:35,859 --> 01:54:49,220
whoosh like that's if there's a storm there's gonna be rain lightning wait so i i let's see

855
01:54:49,220 --> 01:54:56,859
how this thing works oh i can't summon the mech yet i think it's a long oh my god okay

856
01:54:58,140 --> 01:55:12,220
how long does it last it lasts a long time this thing just shoots myconykes everywhere all right

857
01:55:13,930 --> 01:55:27,430
okay i'm gonna get used to these new controls here this thing's pretty cool now you're good

858
01:55:28,149 --> 01:55:42,229
you're good guys oh you're good that's like a insane person time for revenge time for revenge

859
01:55:43,510 --> 01:55:55,020
this thing this thing is so inaccurate this thing is so this thing is so do i have to like not be

860
01:55:55,020 --> 01:56:09,189
moving i can't zoom with it you just shred i think this thing shreds why am i using that term

861
01:56:09,189 --> 01:56:14,789
civilian um civilian stir how do you choose between jumping and dodge rolling uh you have

862
01:56:14,789 --> 01:56:21,590
to hold left to dodge usually okay so i'm holding l2 and sometimes it rolls and sometimes it jumps

863
01:56:21,590 --> 01:56:30,409
yeah yeah it's rolling is left and right oh i see jumping is and weather i cast off these petty

864
01:56:30,409 --> 01:56:41,130
illusions so where's that uh awesome mech i i have to kill enough things like we have to as a team

865
01:56:41,130 --> 01:56:51,210
fill enough things before i can summon it it's about 75 percent oh no no no what are you doing

866
01:56:51,210 --> 01:56:58,090
to me i don't even know you're doing this oh did you get bombed almost it takes a long time to

867
01:56:58,090 --> 01:57:15,529
come in your time that's good initiation procedure get initiated watch out behind you're actually

868
01:57:15,529 --> 01:57:24,199
like crazy glad you know yeah it's really good because their projectiles are so slow by comparison

869
01:57:24,199 --> 01:57:31,380
get out of the dirt it's kind of like dark souls hey i play that you're playing it's like the the

870
01:57:31,380 --> 01:57:43,880
souls of ants sim the souls of ants sim yeah what the hell does that mean there is like a sim

871
01:57:43,880 --> 01:57:52,010
ant game right yeah i tried to play it yeah good games it's very old all right that's the it's

872
01:57:52,010 --> 01:58:01,579
identifying characteristic it's old sim ant yeah i played that once it's old right through the front

873
01:58:01,579 --> 01:58:11,220
door one two get it out there okay i'm i'm almost sort of kind of at the point where i could maybe

874
01:58:11,220 --> 01:58:20,390
summon this thing that i wanted to have it looks like um does it matter if you burst fire or just

875
01:58:20,390 --> 01:58:35,289
hold the button down uh for accuracy yeah for accuracy that's a good question oh i'm just

876
01:58:35,369 --> 01:58:45,109
stinging get away from me okay i can summon the thing all right i guess i press circle

877
01:58:47,739 --> 01:58:51,100
i'm going to take this opportunity to pick up this stuff that's a lot of health over here

878
01:58:51,979 --> 01:59:01,609
just make sure if you need health you come over over this way i need that diffuser such a word

879
01:59:01,609 --> 01:59:13,340
blown out it's terrifying i'm coming eat it i need it oh yeah yeah walk into it come on

880
01:59:14,300 --> 01:59:16,699
i'm actually way better at killing things as a ranger

881
01:59:25,979 --> 01:59:29,159
where the fuck is my thing

882
01:59:31,399 --> 01:59:35,479
i try to keep them around this thing so they just die eventually and not summoning it

883
01:59:36,920 --> 01:59:41,880
okay what i assumed it was the same button to revive people because it said that the

884
01:59:41,880 --> 01:59:46,279
vehicle button oh i'm going towards the smoke stand ball for titanfall

885
01:59:47,930 --> 01:59:54,170
stand fall i'll come back to you guys under it will i get smashed i think so

886
01:59:55,050 --> 02:00:08,140
okay i kind of want to do it sure nope it didn't smash the bug there it is well go get it yes

887
02:00:08,140 --> 02:00:11,979
all right let's see it powered up why do you have like silly spring on your hands

888
02:00:13,699 --> 02:00:17,380
i think it has limited ammo so be aware of that what is it may i

889
02:00:17,460 --> 02:00:24,979
my is it the same buttons to shoot i think it's so slow yeah they're really slow but as long as

890
02:00:24,979 --> 02:00:35,189
you stay there anymore armor oh boy any more crates that i didn't see before there's a jump button

891
02:00:39,079 --> 02:00:40,359
what does r1 l1 do

892
02:00:46,020 --> 02:00:49,779

893
02:00:49,779 --> 02:00:57,380
my frame rate just went down so much my game rate my game rate just went down all right time

894
02:00:57,380 --> 02:01:07,130
to collect how are you supposed to walk in a straight line like mech is drunk oh my god i

895

02:01:19,350 --> 02:01:25,859
which all the grenades have a fuse and the second gun is like dragon ball z

897
02:01:27,619 --> 02:01:31,619
start picking up boxes oh that's what i'm doing don't don't kill them all box time

898
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:37,720
that's what i'm doing for the last like two straight minutes if i pick up health in the mech

899
02:01:37,720 --> 02:01:52,489
though i heal um maybe but yeah there's two separate control schemes here all right i got

937
02:07:37,770 --> 02:07:44,250
i hope it is too i don't think it is i remember that weapon really chewy though so that's where

938
02:07:44,250 --> 02:07:48,090

943
02:08:22,789 --> 02:08:34,250
you fly up into the air and mortar down on people who made that i thought this thing would be

944
02:08:34,890 --> 02:08:45,270
doing more damage so what does this thing do i got a little blinky red boy yeah this thing sucks

945

02:09:00,090 --> 02:09:09,579
aircraft claymore yeah this is not good let's kill nine aircraft plasma destroy is not bad

948
02:09:09,579 --> 02:09:22,069

02:09:22,069 --> 02:09:27,210
i bring with the homing things that i have i want to try the new weapon worth a try see if there

950
02:09:27,210 --> 02:09:32,229
were they had a homing thing as well but it's only a single shot this thing this thing's good

951
02:09:33,260 --> 02:09:41,819
this thing sucks oh fuck i forgot it's using my am i wall that's that's a surprise that's a surprise

952
02:09:41,819 --> 02:09:57,020
egg it's you it's white no one will ever know all right i understand yeah i'm like useless right

953
02:09:57,020 --> 02:10:14,439
now this does have decent range oh you can reload these i'm dead there's a giant health pack next to

954
02:10:14,439 --> 02:10:26,869
me though there's a large we'll we'll spread out coming don't pick up the health before no i have

955
02:10:26,869 --> 02:10:32,229
to because otherwise i'd be at like two health isn't it group heal oh whoops i've no i tried

956
02:10:32,229 --> 02:10:43,050
to swim no group kill the yellow reduces damage you take oh well i'm just gonna only use these

957
02:10:43,050 --> 02:10:54,789
impulse grenades from now on i can't even just i can't do anything this gun is super bad just

958
02:10:54,789 --> 02:11:04,659
germa's character screaming in pain it was supposed to be better it was a higher level

959
02:11:05,380 --> 02:11:12,939
is my thing actually doing anything i'm just gonna go get weapons

960
02:11:18,039 --> 02:11:23,289
i don't think we've got this one in the bag as they say i mean there's so many people here i get

961
02:11:23,289 --> 02:11:37,319
to summon the uh stop reloading they live here okay i feel you well okay no substantial information

962
02:11:37,319 --> 02:11:42,439
about the flying object the other weapon i have is really not great at all there you go i didn't

963
02:11:42,439 --> 02:11:45,399
reload now i'm fully protected against all ufos right here

964
02:11:56,659 --> 02:12:03,479
oh come on destroyer somehow this is working well this defense thing seems really good

965
02:12:03,479 --> 02:12:08,359
we're barely we have double defense because i'm putting down nine separate anti-airs like

966
02:12:08,359 --> 02:12:16,949
shotguns that's the red flashes all right here comes more all right time to reload

967
02:12:21,619 --> 02:12:28,579
oh humans anymore if they were attacking any other mammal we would not be so concerned

968
02:12:30,699 --> 02:12:37,899
basically i love that series what series any other mammal no he's talking about your

969
02:12:37,899 --> 02:12:48,699
basically series oh so he's being a sarcastic cunt whoa whoa my god what the fuck it's a reload

970
02:12:48,699 --> 02:13:03,939
i was just in shock all right here we go uh are you in the mech yeah cool oh my god i think but

971
02:13:03,939 --> 02:13:13,590
it's dealing a lot of damage also i'm almost dead easy easy there what people say that in

972
02:13:13,590 --> 02:13:29,350
england like it's the word serial you're fine demonetize yeah this thing shreds that guy's

973
02:13:29,350 --> 02:13:37,590
already dead all right here it comes that weapon crate but i guess i'll just look up we have to

974
02:13:37,590 --> 02:13:41,590
move from here and die we gotta move from here oh my god they're destroying everything here

975
02:13:42,470 --> 02:13:47,500
it's okay i have a dodge roll his eye frame get me in that little zone

976
02:13:49,500 --> 02:14:02,569
it's still this is actually working i really can't believe you said that on stream star

977
02:14:03,210 --> 02:14:13,130
what like you said serial on stream why are you gonna be so tight you can't say cereal

978
02:14:14,890 --> 02:14:21,689
oh that that green i'm shooting at us what happened to me why does that happen to me

979
02:14:21,689 --> 02:14:34,340
that shot a super giant green laser i love that line i gotta get to this heal there's what there's

980
02:14:34,340 --> 02:14:41,270
a healed station down still where's it in the green where i am oh no it's gone it disappeared

981
02:14:41,270 --> 02:14:48,119
right as i got shoot i'm almost reloaded my guard post though which is the defense this is a pretty

982
02:14:48,119 --> 02:14:58,789
good little weapon here for this mission oh my god okay here comes a shit load where are we off

983
02:14:58,789 --> 02:15:05,449
to and people said this class was boring all right you got it down good i don't think they had anti-air

984
02:15:05,449 --> 02:15:15,380
beacons before i gotta get this health let me try and drop something here

985
02:15:21,590 --> 02:15:25,189
so much going on this actually might work

986
02:15:34,140 --> 02:15:49,289
found the heel the gigantic ship god damn it what happened they're all relatively quite large

987
02:15:50,010 --> 02:16:09,210
i oh my goodness this is what it would like to play far cry five this is what it feels like to

988
02:16:09,210 --> 02:16:25,479
choose right dump sponsored all right i'm gonna start collecting audio back is it really gonna

989
02:16:25,479 --> 02:16:34,899
take this many shots to kill you what the heck was that there's no crates really anywhere i'm

990
02:16:34,899 --> 02:16:47,270
gonna fly over me i dare you okay seriously this thing is a machine gun that like one shot sees

991
02:16:55,610 --> 02:17:03,610
what is it yellow force field uh like our just our health up like she like we resist damage better

992
02:17:03,610 --> 02:17:11,500
yeah yeah there's this damage quite a bit which is i think a big reason why we weren't dying

993
02:17:11,500 --> 02:17:24,729
all right let's see a couple over here did we beat it i don't know it seems kind of quiet seems very

994
02:17:24,729 --> 02:17:37,639
quiet you see any crates into teams of hundreds i don't see any great danger now there's two down

995
02:17:37,639 --> 02:17:42,520
here he's all right we're gonna play laser tech uh there's still something coming this way

996
02:17:44,299 --> 02:17:49,739
let's just race ships over there i just thought you might want a disco party what is over here

997
02:17:49,739 --> 02:17:54,219
since you've got these big red uh flares coming out of your gun these things are remaining

998
02:17:54,219 --> 02:18:00,360
these things are stuck in the building i would have so many points right now

999
02:18:01,159 --> 02:18:07,180
it's gonna stuck in the building you're not allowed to look at me he's desperately trying

1000
02:18:07,180 --> 02:18:12,860
to get over here look i'm gonna protect you i'm gonna make sure not a single alien ship

1001
02:18:12,860 --> 02:18:16,700
gets in i should uh i should reload my stuff just in case we're not done

1002
02:18:18,379 --> 02:18:23,510
i think we're good there you go stand in that circle you'll be safe forever

1003
02:18:23,510 --> 02:18:36,889
hey we finally beat that mission what do you know all right i got the suppressed gun

1004
02:18:40,059 --> 02:18:44,459
oh dude you try out this new silent gun suppressed gun we finally beat it

1005
02:18:45,260 --> 02:18:50,360
well what difficulty was that on that was uh that was normal that was the normal that we couldn't

1006
02:18:50,360 --> 02:18:59,370
take it before closed laser turbo car grit shot up okay what did it do though this mag blaster

1007
02:19:00,649 --> 02:19:03,850
so every time you get a level up it increases the star counter right

1008
02:19:05,290 --> 02:19:11,930
i yeah this doesn't go level up just because you got an up no it's just i think it's a randomized

1009
02:19:11,930 --> 02:19:17,770
chance to have like a better roll maybe depending on how what level it is oh i think if you just

1010
02:19:17,770 --> 02:19:22,569
look and don't immediately press x on every notification it tells you exactly what it

1011
02:19:22,569 --> 02:19:28,729
did yeah it shows you what like what yeah increase too but i just have to x fast because i don't have

1012
02:19:28,729 --> 02:19:34,969
time to look oh you're you're you're mashing x yeah because because i'm the last person to like

1013
02:19:34,969 --> 02:19:40,729
ready up so i gotta go fast well don't listen to him he's a fucking psycho i'm not saying anything

1014
02:19:40,729 --> 02:19:47,079
all i'm saying is that you guys better watch out for my suppressed gun i'm gonna try this i'm

1015
02:19:47,079 --> 02:19:51,639
going to suppress your audio well does it doesn't say what the next mission is

1016
02:19:52,360 --> 02:20:02,309
heading into the city i think it's more air things we need to so many is the same healing

1017
02:20:03,110 --> 02:20:15,530
the quiet threat weapon level up to level three armor limit 320 or less the plan was to head to

1018
02:20:15,530 --> 02:20:20,649
the city through the industrial area but look at those flying saucers in the sky we need to be

1019
02:20:20,649 --> 02:20:26,010
careful all right so is this like a primary error should i keep my anti-air yeah load up

1020
02:20:26,809 --> 02:20:35,559
sounds like it shouldn't do that i'm gonna use my suppressed gun on them i mean you did you have

1021
02:20:35,559 --> 02:20:42,819
said that four times now i think that's because the mission name is the quiet threat i kind of

1022
02:20:42,819 --> 02:20:51,739
want to try a missile launcher they're fun oh actually i have a my class has an item that

1023
02:20:51,739 --> 02:20:57,500
puts like homing beacons on things so that your rocket launchers will home them i was told not

1024
02:20:57,500 --> 02:21:06,520
to pick the air tortoise quiet sequel but the reload is two seconds you're gonna listen to your

1025
02:21:06,520 --> 02:21:14,469
chat oh the lock on time you know let them decide what you do uh do you have a problem with them

1026
02:21:15,479 --> 02:21:22,600
just use a suppressed gun all right i'm just gonna need access to your playstation account see there

1027
02:21:22,600 --> 02:21:26,760
we go see that that's what they changed item collection range is higher on the ranger it

1028
02:21:26,760 --> 02:21:35,159
makes sense it is the ranger here we go wow i like your uh net gun from the how far does this go

1029
02:21:35,159 --> 02:21:44,280
yeah this gun isn't gonna do anything look how far those bullets are spread apart dude this the

1030
02:21:44,280 --> 02:21:51,350
dentist directly up again i don't like the dentist gun very much hey come down here i knew this was

1031
02:21:51,350 --> 02:22:00,389
gonna be bad this thing sucks i think the ufo's are faster than my rockets

1032
02:22:01,430 --> 02:22:05,670
okay just gotta wait for them to come down here and then boom get suppressed

1033
02:22:07,350 --> 02:22:09,909
and not even destroyed get like slightly

1034
02:22:11,510 --> 02:22:17,350
inconvenienced we may have we may have not done the necessary research every start like retreat

1035
02:22:18,229 --> 02:22:24,309
hold on let me just see if i can kill one flying saucer i broke the bridge that was me i got one

1036
02:22:25,270 --> 02:22:38,760
i can't do i'm i'm not here don't fight them all at once i guess that's what they want us to do

1037
02:22:44,420 --> 02:22:50,780
actually this thing's not that bad i don't hate this anymore i can't like lock on to anything

1038
02:22:50,780 --> 02:22:57,620
because nothing is dude let's just run forward into the city they say one by one let's go

1039
02:22:57,620 --> 02:23:03,059
forward and i'll drop down the beacons why would you go against our intelligence my stuff

1040
02:23:03,780 --> 02:23:10,469
don't listen to chat don't listen to the game either so at full power i get it i figured out

1041
02:23:10,469 --> 02:23:18,069
the like speed run tactics here to die forward right at full power this thing does a lot more

1042
02:23:18,069 --> 02:23:21,110
damage

1043
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:40,549
you guys just hit george george okay let's take let's take a stand here all right seems good

1044
02:23:44,059 --> 02:23:51,959
and i'll use my suppressed gun okay i've got anti-air claymores surrounding us

1045
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:57,159
i have this gun where if they come into like melee range of me i push them away and then they

1046
02:23:57,799 --> 02:24:03,479
keep doing us a wind gun this thing i actually like this a lot this is perfect for this michonne

1047
02:24:05,319 --> 02:24:13,909
michonne walking dead wait what can't just come down here and i don't even need to go in the air

1048
02:24:19,510 --> 02:24:22,870
yeah we're playing um i wish i had a mouse for this man versus machine right now

1049
02:24:23,829 --> 02:24:29,829
once i get my own neck will be good well i'll just do something you guys can kill the

1050
02:24:31,190 --> 02:24:33,270
ufo's faster than my rockets can get there

1051
02:24:36,229 --> 02:24:40,579
yeah why do you literally have like the beam weapon that looks probably the best of this

1052
02:24:40,579 --> 02:24:46,420
weapon mission i know it just is i made the right decision somehow and i was just trying it up

1053
02:24:46,420 --> 02:24:52,680
watch out they're gliding in well i suppressed it have any of my rockets hit anything no

1054
02:24:53,559 --> 02:24:59,559
they like don't hurt us at all i think we found the broken overpowered weapon which is your thing

1055
02:24:59,559 --> 02:25:12,870
here you just got to kill a few more and then i can be useful it's fun just hovering around

1056
02:25:12,870 --> 02:25:20,090
just dentists and people look at that guy over there looks like he belongs there okay how far

1057
02:25:20,090 --> 02:25:28,180
can that laser even shoot across like the whole game oh but at 50 percent ammo it's kind of

1058
02:25:28,180 --> 02:25:35,350
worthless well i'm just the guy that makes sure nobody actually gets close because i can't really

1059
02:25:35,350 --> 02:25:40,709
do anything else i think i have to get out you're doing a pretty good job of just doing that

1060
02:25:41,670 --> 02:25:52,549
there's a couple of strays over here why would i even put on the other weapons so the blue ones

1061
02:25:52,549 --> 02:26:04,459
are just background yeah they fly is actually well when my rocket does hit it's really good

1062
02:26:07,260 --> 02:26:08,620
is this uh building gonna go down anything

1063
02:26:09,100 --> 02:26:15,420
we have no choice but to suppress you you mean like the gas refinery next to us

1064
02:26:16,219 --> 02:26:21,500
yeah that thing's gonna blow right all right i'm gonna go collect i'm gonna be useful here

1065
02:26:22,379 --> 02:26:27,819
i haven't been collecting anything they're all scattered around so far though it's hard to

1066
02:26:27,819 --> 02:26:38,059
collect anything i gotta get like a better view all right what we got anyway okay now i know to

1067
02:26:38,059 --> 02:26:46,020
jump up finally not really are we like done did i get my mech and then like the mission was over

1068
02:26:46,819 --> 02:26:53,059
uh i don't really see any ufos in the sky anymore so possibly unless there's a phase two

1069
02:26:57,350 --> 02:27:05,319
can i try the mech next time no that is not my mech no though i was told that it could be if i

1070
02:27:05,319 --> 02:27:12,569
chose this glass well like you actually have guns that do things why does your why does your mech

1071
02:27:12,569 --> 02:27:20,500
have such a big dick what your mech has like a gigantic dick oh it's like zone of the enders

1072
02:27:20,500 --> 02:27:27,299
where you you are you're in the cockpit you're like physically in the cockpit you know i'm out

1073
02:27:27,299 --> 02:27:33,940
of here like seriously it's even got like a discoloration on what do you what do you mean

1074
02:27:33,940 --> 02:27:39,940
what do you have a discolored dick what are you talking about like dickhead yeah but why is that

1075
02:27:39,940 --> 02:27:42,819
what do you tell what do you mean this that's like that adds to the realism what are you talking

1076
02:27:42,819 --> 02:27:49,270
about oh i got the dexter automatic this is the d and edf i gotta get out of here i gotta go

1077
02:27:50,069 --> 02:27:54,870
dude didn't you ever play zone of the enders i didn't play zone of the enders yeah zone of the

1078
02:27:54,870 --> 02:27:59,989
enders like you have a giant flying mech with a head but the guy the pilot is in a see-through

1079
02:27:59,989 --> 02:28:06,579
cockpit oh well when i played i was like 13 so i didn't really put two and two together now you

1080
02:28:06,579 --> 02:28:16,889
know is this uh flying again um it doesn't say we're safe here trust me it says monsters attack

1081
02:28:16,889 --> 02:28:24,010
mission seven so i'd assume okay monsters attack time to not do air stuff then time to never use

1082
02:28:24,010 --> 02:28:34,440
the suppressed gun ever again try the this thing every time star comes around we just

1083
02:28:35,159 --> 02:28:41,879
the conversations they just go off the rails i think you just don't like me anymore

1084
02:28:42,520 --> 02:28:50,520
like you're done with me cast me aside he's too vulgar we only make jokes about being short here

1085
02:28:50,520 --> 02:29:04,139
wait who's too vulgar me i didn't say any of these things i love the completion rate 0.7 percent 0.59

1086
02:29:04,139 --> 02:29:11,350
percent completion rate how do you have a 0.72 percent completion rate oh he played offline no

1087
02:29:11,350 --> 02:29:17,590
no you me you have almost a one percent completion rate probably how many items i found

1088
02:29:17,590 --> 02:29:24,870
yeah because he found items on two classes so maybe oh two for one completed it not even one

1089
02:29:24,870 --> 02:29:35,299
percent okay so i'm good to go german deny it i did deny it that's not true you guys want me to

1090
02:29:35,299 --> 02:29:43,989
be like uh is there any reason i should take a heal gun uh not yet once we start having trouble

1091
02:29:44,950 --> 02:29:52,299
it's based on mission completion with the different classes okay um yeah so that makes sense

1092
02:29:57,700 --> 02:30:05,500
you guys ready i'm ready oh hold on come on you're the expert you have more completion than both of

1093
02:30:05,500 --> 02:30:18,950
us i can't pick my level five gun throw up puke do it puke oh my god everything just goes off the

1094
02:30:18,950 --> 02:30:26,600
rails when you start hearing someone about to throw up wow talk about vulgar it seems safe

1095
02:30:27,239 --> 02:30:32,940
so how is this thing compatible anymore this thing can charge how much does it use

1096
02:30:34,659 --> 02:30:43,590
nice okay i get it let's get in there destroy the monsters oh it's the spiders

1097
02:30:45,030 --> 02:31:00,680
it is the spiders well this thing is fucking awesome i'm gonna drop them

1098
02:31:02,280 --> 02:31:15,079
these things are always scary yeah this game's too scary beware of the thread

1099
02:31:16,040 --> 02:31:35,620
yeah the thread comes out and goes it gets you disgusting really mute are are your anti-air

1100
02:31:35,620 --> 02:31:42,120
guns hitting them when they jump sorry these are like the same as anti-air guns except i pointed

1101
02:31:42,120 --> 02:31:49,209
them down they're effectively the same weapon but they're different loadouts so this is like my

1102
02:31:49,209 --> 02:32:03,750
ground claymore i don't even need guns you want to just die i'm stuck be honest this is really

1103
02:32:03,829 --> 02:32:15,209
effective games is fun to watch i'm not numb to it yet because it's my first one since like

1104
02:32:15,209 --> 02:32:23,270
the playstation 2 but i love how nonchalant you guys are about like oh yeah it's just this is

1105
02:32:23,270 --> 02:32:28,870
default yeah these are spider ones oh this is hey oh yeah the spiders i remember them oh this is

1106
02:32:28,870 --> 02:32:35,340
nothing just wait till just wait till the the game goes off the rails yeah especially when you get

1107
02:32:35,340 --> 02:32:39,420
the megazord happens to play this is this is off the rails for me they gotta up the anti every

1108
02:32:39,500 --> 02:32:42,620
no no no you're playing wait you got the bumpers on in the bowling alley man

1109
02:32:43,579 --> 02:32:52,760
well my point is it's fun that is a very good point i would agree can you not shoot me please

1110
02:32:53,399 --> 02:33:01,450
i mean i could where's the fun in that i want to have fun watch it here it comes it's going

1111
02:33:01,450 --> 02:33:08,149
to open up it's going to be saucers is it crashing i don't know i'm sorry going in a really weird

1112
02:33:08,149 --> 02:33:19,430
direction where is it going okay so the vehicles i get the pilot are they all from the support guy

1113
02:33:19,430 --> 02:33:26,459
or are there going to be like vehicles in the game that the this guy can pilot i don't know

1114
02:33:26,459 --> 02:33:36,979
if you here it comes that you can use it's opening something you can use my mech if you want right now

1115
02:33:37,620 --> 02:33:44,379
i'm kind of having fun with my uh my other weapon i'm melting your whole face off what the hell

1116
02:33:45,850 --> 02:33:51,979
we're supposed to be going somewhere i think we have to wait like ride on it with you that'd be

1117
02:33:51,979 --> 02:33:58,469
pretty cool what happens if you step on me uh i don't it's just in the air isn't it i think

1118
02:33:58,469 --> 02:34:03,510
i can try jumping try pressing on here here it comes here they come no i thought that was

1119
02:34:03,510 --> 02:34:17,799
gonna arc hey push right defeat all monsters so do you get to keep like a an armor buff on your leg

1120
02:34:18,920 --> 02:34:26,440
yeah so i'm bringing that also doing that rain hell it's on top of the mech oh so i place it on

1121
02:34:26,440 --> 02:34:31,719
the mech and it gives me the defense what if it went through them can i put like anti ground

1122
02:34:31,719 --> 02:34:36,760
on your feet uh if you jump up on my hind leg you could probably put them on there

1123
02:34:40,069 --> 02:34:47,299
oh boy bad kind of move i gotta reload i'm just gonna go in and fly through with like a full

1124
02:34:47,299 --> 02:34:54,219
phalanx here let's do it hold on i'm dropping i'm dropping oh you can't dash when you're using

1125
02:34:54,219 --> 02:35:05,290
that okay that makes sense if i'm honest i got one of them on i have like my own spider webs

1126
02:35:05,290 --> 02:35:13,719
uh all these edf guys they're following us yeah i got another one there we go hey you're very

1127
02:35:13,719 --> 02:35:22,200
well defended from a close range right now i don't know what that means that those like red beams

1128
02:35:22,200 --> 02:35:36,979
will auto kill anything they could pull oh all right i gotta collect lots of weapon crates you

1129
02:35:36,979 --> 02:35:42,739
gonna do something about it i'm getting them attention i am collecting them as best as i can

1130
02:35:57,209 --> 02:36:02,489
i don't think they used to like squirt purple goo everywhere i was about to ask if it was like

1131
02:36:02,489 --> 02:36:07,530
bad to stand in or if there's any acid damage or anything it probably is i would not stand in anything

1132
02:36:08,409 --> 02:36:17,129
that is on the ground it's fine god it's fine did we just win yeah uh why was that mission

1133
02:36:17,129 --> 02:36:23,690
significantly easier if there really is such a place the flying levels always are a pain in the

1134
02:36:23,690 --> 02:36:30,889
butt until you get shit like you had the anti-air stuff i think i got all the boxes over here too

1135
02:36:31,690 --> 02:36:35,780
i think it's a bit easier also uh germa's flying class has like

1136
02:36:36,579 --> 02:36:45,639
homing lasers that make it a bit easier yeah the power assist gun long range bolt shooter

1137
02:36:46,680 --> 02:36:55,620
three plus level two let me try that one short range more range not that much though

1138
02:36:56,260 --> 02:37:07,319
i keep getting upgrades for this but that's the the dentist beam lightning bow less energy

1139
02:37:07,399 --> 02:37:17,899
cost pretty good more range on the bolt gun and faster shot speed this is new we got a long

1140
02:37:17,899 --> 02:37:21,659
range weapon developed for use by winged i fire super high voltage bolts of lightning from a long

1141
02:37:21,659 --> 02:37:27,100
distance accurately they can snipe distant targets because the weapon is an early model

1142
02:37:27,100 --> 02:37:31,020
its trajectory may not be very accurate i don't know that we need garden posts anymore actually

1143
02:37:31,020 --> 02:37:48,709
i'll try okay let's go let's go try it um ready that thing is good but oh yeah you you did you

1144
02:37:48,709 --> 02:37:53,510
play smash you're you like smash i did play a little bit of smash not on stream though

1145
02:37:54,069 --> 02:38:03,340
oh so you're already over it uh no it the the online was the online was pretty terrible

1146
02:38:04,379 --> 02:38:10,219
it just you'd queue up nintendo i mean the game is really fun for smash it's like hey queue up

1147
02:38:10,219 --> 02:38:15,260
one v1 let's do some one v1s and it's like oh you want to do four player what type enemy types

1148
02:38:15,260 --> 02:38:23,940
for this particular mission it says monsters so cool maybe more spiders i'm gonna put this

1149
02:38:23,940 --> 02:38:34,809
back on this thing is really good capacity nine nine target lock on i feel like i'm the only one

1150
02:38:36,010 --> 02:38:41,930
that's like it just feels like move me same thing what the fuck it's a new smash game but it just

1151
02:38:41,930 --> 02:38:53,209
it looks it's just the same game i i probably don't know enough did you look account get hacked

1152
02:38:54,889 --> 02:39:11,420
what no i'm talking about one of my mods oh that's how he is

1153
02:39:18,729 --> 02:39:27,979
jesus christ all right let's see how this thing is i'm so ready but oh pylons pylons

1154
02:39:29,479 --> 02:39:37,459
oh look at this thing how far does it go and i wonder what how much energy does it take a lot

1155
02:39:37,459 --> 02:39:42,260
and it's very slow to reload oh hey i got that wait wait wait wait wait wait stand still italics

1156
02:39:42,260 --> 02:39:50,899
stand still that gives you extra damage you're good thank you very nice i think that thing

1157
02:39:50,899 --> 02:39:56,180
actually is a fun weapon whoops i accidentally targeted some civilians but you know what they

1158
02:39:56,180 --> 02:40:06,389
say about civilians this is really fast reload but they're all missing where did you come from

1159
02:40:08,250 --> 02:40:15,770
oh do you want damage bonus jarama oh that sounds like fun coming to me stand still

1160
02:40:15,770 --> 02:40:26,649
i'm standing still and still i don't even have to aim with this gun just power the dentist i just

1161
02:40:26,649 --> 02:40:37,909
let it do all the work i wonder how much damage is that they're doing can these people shut up

1162
02:40:38,709 --> 02:40:45,379
no they say they don't want to die one more time i'm killing them why are you so sadistic

1163
02:40:47,829 --> 02:40:51,110
oh well you were yelling at me earlier for spamming help me and listen to them

1164
02:40:56,219 --> 02:41:00,059
just barely had a range with that is your uh i probably should have picked a weapon that

1165
02:41:00,059 --> 02:41:11,430
was capable of doing damage to the big pylon boom i did good okay time to collect and what

1166
02:41:11,430 --> 02:41:16,790
do you say with what do you say we pick up some weapon pick up pick up some weapon crates

1167
02:41:17,430 --> 02:41:27,159
watch out for the threats i just blew that guy's teeth out of his head here we go

1168
02:41:31,770 --> 02:41:38,520
my frames my frames oh with the power of ps4 pro i have 15 extra frames per second

1169
02:41:38,520 --> 02:41:50,809
your mind okay mission's over oh look at this what is that supposed to be somebody will

1170
02:41:50,809 --> 02:41:56,729
fuck me right stand still stand still stand still you fucking stand i'm gonna shoot you out of here

1171
02:41:57,530 --> 02:42:09,139
what do you want hold on stand still are you like attaching c4 to it what the fuck are you doing

1172
02:42:10,659 --> 02:42:16,500
what the hell all right go what do you mean go there's nothing here yeah there's a pylon over

1173
02:42:16,500 --> 02:42:22,819
here why are they attached to me you they're attached to me yeah now you're like you're like

1174
02:42:22,819 --> 02:42:36,649
even better at shooting oh my god why is this possible like a glowing red this shouldn't be

1175
02:42:36,649 --> 02:42:45,530
possible that's not disco different era come on look at dragon ball z new grounds animation that

1176
02:42:45,530 --> 02:42:56,760
was powering up oh no i've read that i've juke it's distracting to me get these tools off of me

1177
02:42:57,639 --> 02:43:02,120
why do i feel like this is easier than like the first mission yeah because we powered up

1178
02:43:02,120 --> 02:43:05,559
man maybe we should be playing on horror well no it's just like one pylon at a time

1179

i'm getting webbed oh my uh sorry it's alex hi there's something on me i need to go collect

1180
02:43:19,670 --> 02:43:22,629

1181
02:43:23,510 --> 02:43:32,780
i really need to conserve my energy you're putting things on me there's a weapon crate right here

1224
02:50:03,750 --> 02:50:09,670

1225
02:50:09,670 --> 02:50:16,790
launcher tier two oh man here too ants don't live in mountains i had to buy that one for dlc

1330
03:05:52,680 --> 03:05:56,520
there weren't any saucers in that mission but they like that you could kill what's your favorite

flying teleportation vehicles with their golden armor look they gotta pace the game you know they

you're you're not decent just like in real life in where are you taking us we're just driving in a

1546
03:37:25,260 --> 03:37:31,420
circle no i'm driving us to the enemies get out it's enemy time so you can see me too no i don't

1548
03:37:39,879 --> 03:38:06,600
oh you got it ding dong dong that's the doorbell oh they've got me i tried to line up a bommie

1549
03:38:07,239 --> 03:38:13,479
they're they're red i got you i got you i got you i got you almost got you oh they have more hp

1550
03:38:15,430 --> 03:38:19,030
all right collection time to go yeah i don't know if you heard me germa but uh

1551
03:38:19,590 --> 03:38:22,389
this character is not decent down there well

1552
03:38:24,389 --> 03:38:27,909
you gotta warn me in this stuff star hold on don't do don't talk to the chief commander

1553
03:38:39,979 --> 03:38:47,559
really the mother ship i didn't i reacted building oh boy

1554
03:38:49,530 --> 03:38:55,139
so if we destroy that thing so every time you get an armor it permanently adds it what's like a good

1555
03:38:55,139 --> 03:39:03,219
amount of armor to have uh hundreds is it just damage negation or is it like hp it's just hp i

1556
03:39:03,219 --> 03:39:11,340
think it's just hp at least that's what i think now maybe does that h see it says armor in here

1557
03:39:11,340 --> 03:39:14,620
but it says hp when you finish the mission but i'm pretty sure it's damaged negation

1558
03:39:15,260 --> 03:39:22,500
hmm it depends on the class the other game depends on the class yeah what class you are

1559
03:39:22,500 --> 03:39:35,620
it would mitigate damage different amounts here comes an air strike goodbye i would like them to

1560
03:39:35,620 --> 03:39:45,930
use some of the air vehicles because i can kill those um behind us it looks like it's like some

1561
03:39:45,930 --> 03:39:53,459
kind of currency thing it might be we're missing somebody is it one ant over there

1562
03:39:54,420 --> 03:40:06,520
yeah i got it i'm gonna do some driving i'm gonna make my way over this way it looks like

1563
03:40:06,520 --> 03:40:16,979
just a handful of ants i'm in oh yeah we're coming whoops so daisy okay watch out here comes the

1564
03:40:16,979 --> 03:40:24,149
grape is there a mother ship i don't watch out here comes the great happening i think it's just

1565
03:40:24,149 --> 03:40:29,780
these ants over here at the moment i'm glad this mission is not gonna show my kill i think i'm gonna

1566
03:40:29,780 --> 03:40:35,270
switch back to the class i think that's it because you guys are carrying right now

1567
03:40:36,069 --> 03:40:44,889
what are you you still on um i'm still on the uh soldier guy ranger i thought i was going to

1576
03:42:09,829 --> 03:42:15,510
i'm underneath a giant red ant ass you know you can still shoot while you're being eaten

1577
03:42:15,510 --> 03:42:20,780
yeah that like helps you free yourself yeah i killed myself with explosives

1578
03:42:26,250 --> 03:42:28,729
well that was a little hairy

1579
03:42:31,610 --> 03:42:39,909
i got you on the floor did we go into space well initially that initial explosion i thought i went

1580
03:42:39,909 --> 03:42:48,700
over the mountains this isn't just a world war it's a space war it is a space war any other

1581
03:42:55,030 --> 03:43:04,569
this isn't just a ground war we're from space plasma fall up we did get napalm though maybe

1582
03:43:04,569 --> 03:43:12,139
we should be playing with grenades plasma fall i just i need a corridor i need a long stretch of

1583
03:43:12,139 --> 03:43:26,170
land for it to work very well okay um we might okay this might be the destroy the mothership

1584
03:43:26,170 --> 03:43:31,129
mission it's a destroy the mothership mission then i'm going to pick so you have to shoot up

1585
03:43:31,129 --> 03:43:36,969
into it but i think it also drops stuff um so i need this to level up what's the best thing

1586
03:43:36,969 --> 03:43:47,930
i got probably this i oh you can use level five stuff now yeah bolt shooter no plasma

1587
03:43:47,930 --> 03:43:54,120
falling i'm gonna get rid of these special right now i feel like it's good but i'd rather have

1588
03:43:54,120 --> 03:43:59,829
more things to shoot so i'm gonna go lightning bow m2 i haven't got any more deployable guns

they're hiding in the shadows of buildings germa how can we fight this enemy blow his arms off

1640
03:52:43,799 --> 03:52:54,819
jeez damn it am i not getting these rockets are they hitting the mother

1641
03:52:54,819 --> 03:53:01,350

1642
03:53:01,350 --> 03:53:18,979
all right i'm coming to utah thank you so much oh boy oh boy no what the fuck

1644
03:53:30,579 --> 03:53:36,760
there's soldiers my gun isn't doing it like there's nothing about okay what i missed that

1645
03:53:36,760 --> 03:53:50,280
one apparently okay oh we all no wonder we're on all sides right now fuck okay this is definitely

1646
03:53:50,280 --> 03:53:55,639
better even though i cannot block anything uh we you know we got to focus oh my god we have to

1647
03:53:55,639 --> 03:54:02,200
focus on one of them at a time they're regenerating yeah the frogs regenerate i think the wrong time

1648
03:54:02,280 --> 03:54:11,420
to change classes shit oh shit i'm not my gun isn't doing anything fuck i'm dead goodbye

1649
03:54:13,319 --> 03:54:18,409
i guess they're joining you shortly yeah we have to focus we have to focus on one at a time

1650
03:54:18,409 --> 03:54:24,090
otherwise they're just gonna keep undertaking back up i have my gun stopped doing things

1651
03:54:24,809 --> 03:54:37,540
i'm gonna get my shotgun back that thing is just too inaccurate for me are they talking there that

1652
03:54:37,540 --> 03:54:52,540
was weird all right yeah all played all played did your mom i would do that so i could just sing

1653
03:54:52,540 --> 03:55:02,790
the theme song over and over again oh wait i had a sniper what oh my god dummy um it's not a big

1654
03:55:02,790 --> 03:55:08,629
fat dummy i think what else do i want though what would be good against those guys maybe something

1655
03:55:08,629 --> 03:55:22,389
like this what what's the thing that just goes which one's better probably power lance or spark

1656
03:55:22,389 --> 03:55:27,670
spark mine hey could you do me a favor what's up can you leave the call and then come back in

1657
03:55:27,670 --> 03:55:33,670
me oh is he's hearing staticky to you too yes he is i'm staticky yeah you're just static guy

1658
03:55:37,350 --> 03:55:44,790
hello i was apologizing yeah wait am i still was hello yeah you're still bad how i don't know

1659
03:55:44,790 --> 03:55:53,219
is either discord or i don't know yeah it might be that discord problem i had because you sound

1660
03:55:53,219 --> 03:55:59,540
normal stir yeah hold on i know the fix for it and because you use uh scarlet solo right yes

1661
03:56:00,420 --> 03:56:03,860
yeah that call hold on let me try and remember what the fix is wait a minute wait a minute wait

1662
03:56:03,860 --> 03:56:10,260
wait am i am i statically statically on the stream no it would only be on your discord

1663
03:56:10,260 --> 03:56:19,579
so go to voice and video settings on discord yeah on discord okay scroll down to where it says

1664
03:56:19,579 --> 03:56:31,020
audio subsystem yeah oh my in the advanced sound options okay echo cancellation noise

1665
03:56:31,020 --> 03:56:39,430
suppression automatic gain control quality of service uh lower lower audio subsystems

1666
03:56:39,430 --> 03:56:53,399
below that standard show a warning when yeah set it set it to legacy legacy yeah okay all right hold

1667
03:56:53,399 --> 03:57:01,739
on what the fuck is my back hello yep how do i sound you're better i sound better you sound

1668
03:57:01,739 --> 03:57:11,239
great crisp as clear as kittens so what what the hell was that that's strange all right well

1669
03:57:11,239 --> 03:57:19,739
but it yeah it really would be like that sometimes i think i like my preparation here i'm just gonna

1670
03:57:19,739 --> 03:57:25,540
fully charge this and drive right into their face i'm gonna just drive straight in and just

1671
03:57:25,940 --> 03:57:32,899
uh did you fix it i think so i guess cool when did this start happening like 20 minutes ago

1672
03:57:34,340 --> 03:57:38,899
it like slowly got worse and worse it did yeah i thought it was the same thing as italics i

1673
03:57:38,899 --> 03:57:43,540
thought it was my capture card so i just ignored it that's odd i have the capture card interference

1674
03:57:43,540 --> 03:57:47,620
too it would have been fine on your stream though because it's only discord that happens

1675
03:57:48,579 --> 03:57:59,610
it's very odd all right i'm gonna try this again yeah all right let's try this again i'm gonna try

1676
03:57:59,610 --> 03:58:09,110
to take damage modifiers up what's the range on this thing again so does each one of these

1677
03:58:09,110 --> 03:58:29,770
stack on me how much damage boost is this i don't know one all righty two that's two hits

1678
03:58:33,270 --> 03:58:53,139
oh boy well you're flying real low whoa oh dear watch out for the frogs okay when the game audio

1679
03:58:53,139 --> 03:59:04,229
gets real quiet and it just people going get me away from this nonsense i'm with tank boy

1680
03:59:05,110 --> 03:59:09,850
are you riding on the thing uh no i put the damage boost on it so i'm just following it

1681
03:59:09,850 --> 03:59:14,700
i'm gonna come back to you guys i'm kind of getting overwhelmed i'm getting overwhelmed

1682
03:59:14,780 --> 03:59:18,059
i need to come back with the team oh i can do a booster that's pretty cool

1683
03:59:23,290 --> 03:59:27,049
yeah you i haven't like seen anything you just like flew over there in a bit of fighting with

1684
03:59:27,049 --> 03:59:35,620
everything yeah it's turning around i'm buying you guys know drink drink drink oh boy you're

1685
03:59:35,620 --> 03:59:40,860
playing a drinking game in chat what did somebody say drinking game in real life

1686
03:59:43,270 --> 03:59:47,829
every time cat takes a drink we take a drink that's the game yeah that's the whole game

1687
03:59:48,790 --> 03:59:53,510
that sounds that sounds good who's drinking right now all right ready here we go

1688
03:59:55,190 --> 04:00:00,760
butt chug why do i always pick the worst fucking things to read

1689
04:00:01,719 --> 04:00:08,139
did you read butt chug i just read that out loud yeah i wrote that i wouldn't be surprised we did

1690
04:00:09,260 --> 04:00:13,260
since i don't know like you think you're being such a jokester

1691
04:00:14,059 --> 04:00:21,190
extraterrestrial beings similar to humans i hate that they say frogs are similar to humans

1692
04:00:21,190 --> 04:00:25,670
they are though you know that they stand up on two feet that's the only enemy so far that only has

1693
04:00:25,670 --> 04:00:30,790
two feet and they regenerate and they are giant and they're frogs wait you guys hold on you guys

1694
04:00:30,790 --> 04:00:35,590
actually he said almost identical to humans that's what you guys don't know that frog dna is actually

1695
04:00:35,590 --> 04:00:41,989
like genetically like the genome is as close as to humans as anything else say chino oh chino

1696
04:00:41,989 --> 04:00:50,969
oh you know you're not wrong yes frogs are genetically as close as possible to humans

1697
04:00:50,969 --> 04:00:59,020
almost identical yeah we're growing in batch just like those i'm just as slimy as them

1698
04:01:01,159 --> 04:01:10,649
that's because i don't shower i got an idea what are those i love that my idea stands directly next

1699
04:01:10,649 --> 04:01:15,290
to one of the canisters all three of us my idea is just get uh get the f out of here you know

1700
04:01:15,290 --> 04:01:22,809
i mean and wait till they spawn and then hey germa pick your head up pick your i want to see you

1701
04:01:23,450 --> 04:01:30,809
i got you i want to see you something is coming out here we go gotcha i don't think we're supposed

1702
04:01:30,809 --> 04:01:36,489
to defend from this like open no cover courtyard where they come from all sides oh he was like i

1703
04:01:36,489 --> 04:01:42,790
didn't even know he got shot in the head he just was like i'm ready to go guys break discord again

1704
04:01:46,729 --> 04:01:52,250

1705
04:01:53,370 --> 04:01:59,340
i think my brain broke last round okay i switched guns and i'm also actually killing things now too

1706
04:01:59,340 --> 04:02:03,340
so all right do we have to how much of their body has to be destroyed is this like um

1707
04:02:04,139 --> 04:02:10,299
oh geez man dragon ball z reference no it's a like a zombie reference they have to destroy their head

frogs oh shit no wonder my head was hurting like all this yelling all right we need to focus

1730
04:05:25,670 --> 04:05:32,280
because we need to focus on least which canister we're going up first uh i don't know there's so

04:05:32,280 --> 04:05:39,000
many how about oh my god who knows you choose i don't know all right why later over here with

1733
04:05:54,489 --> 04:06:12,309
what okay okay we did it we did it good job good nice work grenades and support equipment okay

1734
04:06:15,479 --> 04:06:29,530
i like i'm not getting anything new anymore now that's a victory let's go it's you it's

1735
04:06:29,530 --> 04:06:34,229
really good to see you in one piece yeah the minigun was doing well i kind of can't take

1736
04:06:34,229 --> 04:06:46,090
this thing off but this thing got better yeah i'll try it again the galleon i haven't tried

1737
04:06:46,090 --> 04:07:02,170
this yet i'm gonna give it a go oh i never summoned my capacity 19 what version of fortnight is this

1738
04:07:02,170 --> 04:07:12,979
um season seven one it's a good version dude did you see the storm king no do you play fortnight

1739
04:07:12,979 --> 04:07:18,420
didn't you play fortnight for a little while i played save the world when that's all there was

1740
04:07:19,219 --> 04:07:27,700
so why didn't use what type of enemies uh it's probably frogs frogs i would assume it's probably

1741
04:07:27,700 --> 04:07:32,659
frogs because we just got overwhelmed by frogs okay yeah i think it's frogs then i won't pick

1742
04:07:32,659 --> 04:07:49,379
sword guy uh but yeah if so did you ever play any of the battle royale for fortnight played like

1743
04:07:50,889 --> 04:07:55,770
one day when it the first day it came out i played at first and then i first impression

1744
04:07:56,729 --> 04:08:05,610
oh what was my first impression yeah well what's your first impression first impression was that

1745
04:08:05,610 --> 04:08:09,770
the random bullet spread was way too extreme and i quit because of that and then they fixed it three

1746
04:08:09,770 --> 04:08:16,700
days later and i never played it again anyway okay okay they fixed it three days okay i wait i

1747
04:08:16,700 --> 04:08:22,379
zoomed out they're like they're like roaming as if they don't know we're here so we i think it's

1748
04:08:22,459 --> 04:08:29,979
assuming that we're going to like this guy's still fucking alive he's still alive i'm still

1749
04:08:29,979 --> 04:08:37,959
talking how is this guy still living okay we need to stick together so when germa flies away and

1750
04:08:37,959 --> 04:08:44,440
does his own thing dude well i can actually keep up with you guys now all right so because i have

1751
04:08:44,440 --> 04:08:52,809
two behind us down the road down the road behind us i do see they're roaming but there's one

1752
04:08:52,809 --> 04:08:57,209
actually behind us yes there actually is one behind there is actually one behind us

1753
04:08:58,840 --> 04:09:09,719
he's dodging a lot actually to our right my god the accuracy the inaccuracy

1754
04:09:15,319 --> 04:09:20,389
that's that's the pinpoint accuracy i want things actually really good

1755
04:09:27,290 --> 04:09:33,059
dude they're just like humans well i feel like i'm killing people when i kill them that's going

1756
04:09:33,059 --> 04:09:39,219
to leave me with some severe ptsd oh fuck i just too many here why am i doing what am i doing over

1757
04:09:39,219 --> 04:09:51,049
by myself i cannot dehumanize this enemy i'm going back to you guys class dismissed i just need

1758
04:09:51,049 --> 04:09:57,290
to get my mech so that i can be a big human then you'll look just like them even more yeah all

1759
04:09:57,290 --> 04:10:07,030
right let's pick up some of this shit what do you say go for headshots really yes because they're

1760
04:10:07,030 --> 04:10:16,709
just like humans is that why that's what i've been told they are zombies oh i'm pretty good

1761
04:10:16,709 --> 04:10:20,229
at those headshots his head does come off and i don't think they can regenerate them oh my god

1762
04:10:20,629 --> 04:10:30,469
behind me what the just watching the giant frogman collapse is pretty humorous

1763
04:10:37,299 --> 04:10:41,299
they're just shooting walls oh dodge good dodge man

1764
04:10:45,590 --> 04:10:46,469
a lot of power services

1765
04:10:53,450 --> 04:10:57,370
uh any more boxes that i missed anymore maybe back here

1766
04:10:58,010 --> 04:11:02,569
i don't think i've seen a single

1767
04:11:06,440 --> 04:11:10,709
okay why is this one like easier than the last one yeah it really is

1768
04:11:15,770 --> 04:11:21,190
because they don't spawn in a circle around us all aware of us maybe true

1769
04:11:24,899 --> 04:11:33,450
headshot standing right next to it okay never mind wait what what i do

1770
04:11:34,010 --> 04:11:40,969
there's a big health box right behind you if you want it i got full health who am i next to

1771
04:11:40,969 --> 04:11:48,569
star no i'm next to an mpc that is just you but without your name this is a special

1772
04:11:49,290 --> 04:11:54,729
you were like really good at fortnight weren't you what are you talking to what are you saying

1773
04:12:00,780 --> 04:12:02,780
oh i forgot i was the stupid grenade

1774
04:12:04,860 --> 04:12:10,459
who's the last person in this call to play pubg it's probably star no it's you

1775
04:12:14,440 --> 04:12:21,350
no but are we counting pubg on mobile yeah because is that not also called pubg i mean

1776
04:12:21,350 --> 04:12:26,790
that's the first part of the title the second part is mobile why why did you play pubg on mobile

1777
04:12:26,790 --> 04:12:34,250
i don't know why does anybody do anything forward and i wanted to try it that was a well-timed

1778
04:12:34,250 --> 04:12:42,969
stream i got that was a double headshot that was worth it right there bingo i'll get all three of

1779
04:12:42,969 --> 04:12:50,700
them oh man i could smell it from here they're not singing anymore they were screaming but they're

1780
04:12:50,700 --> 04:12:56,600

1781
04:12:56,600 --> 04:13:08,260
one of the strongest chorus this is the strongest thing i have is that kind of floating all right

1782
04:13:08,260 --> 04:13:18,600
fuck it wow that guy's dead i saw that so do you get to choose what your mech weapon loadout is

1783

uh there's different mechs oh yeah can i land oh fuck what that just get the shit out of me

1784
04:13:30,979 --> 04:13:42,180
i think you're gonna slide off yeah you can fly so much longer than me mommy mech i'm going down

1785
04:13:42,180 --> 04:13:54,870
this side street it's not worth it i'm gonna go check for health found an enemy finally

1786
04:13:57,610 --> 04:14:10,860
yeah i'm doing more like walking around this yeah than anything yeah i keep accidentally touching

1787
04:14:10,860 --> 04:14:18,819
the touchpad the touch screen and they like run away and hide i don't have the time to go over there

1788
04:14:18,819 --> 04:14:29,020
here no he's dead don't worry i got it whoops my finger hurts there's one more guy down here

1789
04:14:29,020 --> 04:14:34,569
getting cramps too i feel like if my guy's so slow and floaty that if i just push the thumb

1790
04:14:34,569 --> 04:14:40,459
sticks harder i'll go faster look how far away these last two are well i'll see you guys uh when

1791
04:14:40,459 --> 04:14:45,420
the end of the mission happens now i'm gonna hit him from here i think you're the fastest one aren't

1792
04:14:45,420 --> 04:14:53,209
you well yeah i'm like i'll be there in like two seconds touching a touchpad is what is yeah the

1793
04:14:53,209 --> 04:15:00,739
touchpad makes it go emote you do like a random emote this is actually a lot down here i probably

1794
04:15:00,739 --> 04:15:13,219
can't do this by myself well may as well play with the civilians i'm getting there

1795
04:15:21,620 --> 04:15:35,590
this stream is my stream is jazz plus help me help me you're gonna finish it by the time i get

1796
04:15:35,590 --> 04:15:47,299
no i'm not i'm not i'm not i'm not i'm not i'm dead every time i say thanks i think they emote

1797
04:15:47,299 --> 04:15:54,889
at you no i hit the emote accidentally i think like after they killed you they emote taunt it

1798
04:15:59,579 --> 04:16:09,190
this is like the perfect gun for killing them nothing like the good sea shit his arms are

1799
04:16:09,270 --> 04:16:13,829
flying into the screen that guy with no arms rolled backward looks so cute

1800
04:16:17,239 --> 04:16:21,319
hey i finally made it pick me up pick me up before it's over so i can pick up all the stuff

1801
04:16:22,120 --> 04:16:29,899
i'm coming it's really not much stuff here is there

1802
04:16:31,959 --> 04:16:38,409
well that was not a fart i i would okay oh big plasma can i got leveled up nice

1803
04:16:38,969 --> 04:16:46,600
oh a dash cell okay how much not farting

1804
04:16:49,500 --> 04:17:00,059
pretty decent damage upgrade i'll keep it on i don't know more frogs of course ready

1805
04:17:00,860 --> 04:17:05,260
i want a helicopter already mom maybe we can go back into a hard mission

1806
04:17:05,899 --> 04:17:15,350
yeah we could stuff should i do that um can i pee after this mission or before the mission

1807
04:17:15,350 --> 04:17:19,030
go pee right now because italics takes like 20 minutes to pick what he wants all right i'm peeing

1808
04:17:19,750 --> 04:17:24,409
i'll be right back i'm gonna put it on the hard i like to have fun and i switch my weapons sometimes

1809
04:17:24,409 --> 04:17:33,479
peeing what was a quick easy one this was a nice one also i don't understand the difference

1810
04:17:33,479 --> 04:17:56,120
between booster and thruster enhancer but this one blood storm i'm gonna use blood storm we're

1811
04:17:56,120 --> 04:18:04,020
gonna fight a bunch of ants okay okay hard difficulty ants and red ants well then this

1812
04:18:04,020 --> 04:18:11,799
is probably not a good weapon um the swords actually might make sense here then

1813
04:18:20,170 --> 04:18:34,549
if that's the case then i would want the dash cell okay i'm also gonna pee because i'm ready

1814
04:18:34,549 --> 04:18:39,559
and you can start whenever you want oh maybe i should pee and be the last one to come back

1815
04:18:40,520 --> 04:20:11,190
maybe i should be the last one to pee and the last one to come back all right they put here well

1816
04:20:11,190 --> 04:20:21,459
looks like it's just me they all left hi no no i'm here oh i was the last one to leave and

1899
04:31:49,100 --> 04:31:53,020
there is nowhere safe on earth the earth is turning into a battlefield

1900
04:31:53,020 --> 04:31:56,940
and if i shoot it i'm dead so i'm whatever i'm coming

1901
04:32:06,120 --> 04:32:12,680
i know they're dead i'm dead only left is germabot we're all dead i'm coming

1902
04:32:15,239 --> 04:32:18,120
this is not a promotion for a film or a tv show

1903
04:32:18,520 --> 04:32:23,059
extraterrestrials this is not a tv show

1904
04:32:29,239 --> 04:32:31,049
it's pretty far apparently actually

1905
04:32:34,739 --> 04:32:38,819
man i should have summoned my mechs a long time ago yeah probably isn't that your special

1906
04:32:38,819 --> 04:32:44,020
forgetting i have them is that it we love it i'm just having bombs all the time is there anything

1907
04:32:44,020 --> 04:32:55,420
else is that the end of it i thought that's a good farm pretty good farm level alien alien ant farm

1908
04:32:55,420 --> 04:33:05,290
you guys like that band well i got level zero items from that hard mission that was really

1909
04:33:05,290 --> 04:33:11,419
that was good i got some really great new shit i did not spark find that better stuff

1910
04:33:14,619 --> 04:33:24,860
almost my first level eight guys i'm so excited class we can't be this might be too high though

1911
04:33:24,860 --> 04:33:33,779
a little six well let's do that one more time rapid mirage so i didn't get anything and then

1912
04:33:33,779 --> 04:33:50,139
the vibro hammer i didn't get anything so i can use rapid mirage that's a lot of rockets

1913
04:33:50,779 --> 04:33:57,130
oh i can use this too both of them and they're both really good 15 targets very cool let's try

1914
04:33:57,130 --> 04:34:11,770
it watch your back this time as you level up you get to wear less armor um i don't think so no i

1915
04:34:11,770 --> 04:34:18,139
think it's just you pick up those armor boxes and that's how you permanently increase your armor in

1916
04:34:18,139 --> 04:34:37,900

2001
04:48:03,849 --> 04:48:09,369
like a raspberry and blueberry popsicle just watch out for the monsters it didn't work out

2002
04:48:10,330 --> 04:48:21,130
they're in it together what's the difference between the aliens and monsters the aliens came

2003
04:48:21,130 --> 04:48:26,729
from above and the monsters came from below um no one knows i don't yeah what i'm doing

2004
04:48:26,729 --> 04:48:41,779
pretty far off i gotta get back here look like i came out of the frog i was in his stomach i need

2005
04:48:41,779 --> 04:48:49,819
to fly up there and do a little bit of spray i feel like i'm just like throwing marbles being

2006
04:48:49,819 --> 04:49:06,380
being effective i can't even see what i'm throwing well we're not dying as fast we are not

2007
04:49:11,849 --> 04:49:25,369
electricity melee yeah i'm shocking this guy's brain i saw that oh missed one yeah

2008
04:49:26,810 --> 04:49:30,490
well we're using these stupid grenades because it's so annoying to shoot my stupid gun

2009
04:49:34,520 --> 04:49:38,919
this thing's all right but i don't it doesn't seem too effective maybe when it gets a higher

2010
04:49:38,919 --> 04:49:43,319
rank of level because just yeah long as taking me to kill this regular just

2011
04:49:43,959 --> 04:49:50,520
ray and yeah that's how i feel i'd use like a level one weapon for this yeah i think i don't

2012
04:49:50,520 --> 04:49:58,810
know about that thing it's cool but it is cool but it's not as good as this not even close

2013
04:49:59,529 --> 04:50:06,340
let me get some stuff i hope this mission is over soon i don't want to use this anymore

2014
04:50:07,220 --> 04:50:10,169

2015
04:50:21,689 --> 04:50:27,930

2022
04:51:29,659 --> 04:51:40,979
oh fuck okay like time to really get the fuck out of here i am basically the tank now though

2023
04:51:45,659 --> 04:52:06,060
there's so many raw guy back go to hell ants don't go to hell or anywhere they go to

2024
04:52:07,639 --> 04:52:21,990
ant heaven why why would they do that my grandma was an ant my grandma was a queen ant

2025
04:52:24,569 --> 04:52:32,389
can we deal with the frog over here please what the frog are you pulling a uh you know who right

2026
04:52:32,389 --> 04:52:43,340
now yeah i can't say it the joke is off limits why are you doing off limit references you got

2027
04:52:43,659 --> 04:52:50,139
you do only only references that are you got the syllabus you got the syllabus before the stream

2028
04:52:51,259 --> 04:52:55,380
you know it's allowed it's not allowed i didn't read it no one reads their syllabus

2029
04:52:55,380 --> 04:52:58,340
and that's what happens when you get punished for not reading the syllabus that's what

2030
04:52:58,340 --> 04:53:00,900
now you're in trouble because you want to make references that are not allowed

2031
04:53:02,020 --> 04:53:11,369
you're all right my gun is capable of freeing me from from the ant i'm on my way so you're

2032
04:53:11,369 --> 04:53:17,049
all right i'm all right but i'm gonna die soon if i don't get healed i'm dead i feel like every

2033
04:53:17,049 --> 04:53:22,250
ant has ignored me because i'm not doing anything those are some cool flips you did there to get to

2034
04:53:22,250 --> 04:53:32,650
me thanks man i was impressed i kind of need this oh fuck and this is where it all goes to hell

2035
04:53:35,159 --> 04:53:42,779
this is where it goes to hell squad following me true flipping around all over the place

2036
04:53:49,909 --> 04:53:55,189
all right so am i crazy and saying this in chat some some chat people actually know did the air

2037
04:53:55,189 --> 04:54:01,990
raider used to have the tanks and the helicopters and i was told that the ranger gets tanks yeah he

2038
04:54:01,990 --> 04:54:06,709
does and his equipment there was a spot for tanks like it doesn't like i don't know your name is

2039
04:54:06,709 --> 04:54:13,509
air raider you don't get the helicopters so air raider does not get helicopters no that's all i

2040
04:54:13,509 --> 04:54:18,709
want maybe because ranger was kind of just default and maybe a little boring for people they

2041
04:54:19,110 --> 04:54:25,189
decided to give the ranger some other stuff are there any more classes by chance no okay

2042
04:54:26,619 --> 04:54:31,099
they just took the four and were like let's just make up a bunch of things last game the jetpack

2043
04:54:31,099 --> 04:54:39,060
one was new wasn't it um i don't remember i mean i only played the the last one i played four i

2044
04:54:39,060 --> 04:54:46,259
think i played the third one or i didn't get it at all yeah air raider only gets land vehicles

2045
04:54:46,259 --> 04:54:53,450
and and apcs i feel like the ranger would get the apcs depending down for you know i got the

2046
04:54:53,450 --> 04:55:02,169
minion buster new stuff nice better plasma cannon watch out better grit shot get the minion buster

2047
04:55:02,169 --> 04:55:11,270
that's my cannon oh and i never used my collector thing that i had that's not really that much of an

2048
04:55:11,270 --> 04:55:24,150
upgrade but oh and the dinky motorcycles oh we're doing it we're doing a cave is it a cave

2049
04:55:25,029 --> 04:55:33,270
all right i'm gonna put on the uh anti-ant gear coming where is it this thing and

2050
04:55:35,349 --> 04:55:42,139
i wonder what else i should do maybe this should add a shotgun just leveled it up anyways

2051
04:55:43,880 --> 04:55:53,540
oh yeah this stupid thing this is perfect 1.5 completion rate yeah this game is absolutely huge

2052
04:55:55,430 --> 04:56:00,389
what wait we're just in terms of how many things there are to find i mean we're on level 17 on

2053
04:56:00,389 --> 04:56:06,950
normal yeah i believe like 1.5 percent through the content well because i think it's every level is

2054
04:56:06,950 --> 04:56:15,110
a piece of that percentage every difficulty so there are like 170 there's like 170 levels

2055
04:56:15,110 --> 04:56:20,150
each one of those levels has a different difficulty and there are yeah there's a

2056
04:56:20,150 --> 04:56:26,630
hundreds of hundreds of am i crazy or did the last game have like a dlc that added like 40 levels

2057
04:56:26,630 --> 04:56:34,790
um there's one you want to use the laser you want to use the laser guide kit for this or no

2058
04:56:34,790 --> 04:56:42,459
oh no i'm playing radio each difficulty with each class so there are four classes and let's say

2059
04:56:42,459 --> 04:56:50,779
there's 150 levels and five difficulties per level so you're doing that's five ten fifteen twenty

2060
04:56:51,819 --> 04:56:59,720
just for the classes two or you don't know you'll see that added like the dragons and stuff

2061
04:57:00,599 --> 04:57:08,259
dude i'm telling you it's italics every time that's because i'm being falsely accused of things also

2062
04:57:08,259 --> 04:57:14,500
you were the last one literally the last mission so no never happened literally can someone back

2063
04:57:14,500 --> 04:57:21,500
him up his claim because i think it's baseless anyways he distracted me from what i was doing

2064
04:57:22,459 --> 04:57:30,939
i like at least i got time to like stand up and stretch like if every time i'm waiting for

2065
04:57:31,900 --> 04:57:35,979
the game i'm gonna be jacked you only have one weapon per slot for your new character

2066
04:57:35,979 --> 04:57:40,740
should play something that doesn't pad the game yeah but this is really good just

2067
04:57:41,380 --> 04:57:44,419
it is fun just to kind of run around and shoot bugs

2068
04:57:48,330 --> 04:57:53,049
there we go oh i'm gonna love this level stupid bounce gun oh man

2069
04:57:56,650 --> 04:58:13,750
that is the thing is awesome all right here we go monsters just melt melt melt melt

2070
04:58:14,389 --> 04:58:25,349
holy shoot these grenades are huge going down the toilet drain compared to the little tiny fire

2071
04:58:25,349 --> 04:58:35,380
cracker things foxes do we get them holy shit it takes like 300 bullets what's my other gun

2077
04:59:38,220 --> 04:59:42,380
dude these grenades are like bigger explosions than the airstrikes i was calling in

2078
04:59:47,750 --> 04:59:55,319
we're gonna have to use full force in both of these holes you really are you are quite a comedian

2079
04:59:56,439 --> 05:00:07,799
what a comedian no i want that help i am just you know repeating my favorite joke that i heard

2080
05:00:08,840 --> 05:00:14,439
from one comedian german 985 when did i make that joke when did i make that reference ever

2081

2082
05:00:26,150 --> 05:00:33,419

2083
05:00:33,419 --> 05:00:42,299
radius around your body yeah i'm pretty fast now actually i'll scout it out looks like we got

2084
05:00:44,229 --> 05:00:50,680
um and it like hurts to hold this down it looks like um there are frogs down here

2085
05:00:53,430 --> 05:00:57,380

and why does it put my camera in my butt there are aliens underground did you know that watch

2087

2088
05:01:21,590 --> 05:01:28,150
this grenade i'm sure the frog is dead yeah this missile launcher is way overkill for what we're

2089
05:01:28,150 --> 05:01:36,840
fighting plus it hits the my rocket launcher hits the ceiling weapon crate over here

2090
05:01:37,720 --> 05:01:45,049
well that was a useless item don't step in they will certainly become a terrible threat in the

2091
05:01:45,049 --> 05:01:50,090
future we must eliminate should have just been dash man i wonder when the bosses do you remember

2092

2109
05:04:38,099 --> 05:04:45,380
you just holding the left thumbstick as fast as me r1 r1 switch r1 switch r1 i have to do like a

2110
05:04:46,020 --> 05:04:53,029
like a sequence of modifiers to go this fast well this really hurts my phone

2111
05:04:55,349 --> 05:04:57,509
through any consolation a new species

2112
05:04:57,669 --> 05:04:58,310
species

2113
05:05:04,069 --> 05:05:11,380
70 meters long we're asking about bosses maybe this is the queen ant

2114
05:05:13,060 --> 05:05:13,459
probably

2115
05:05:13,860 --> 05:05:17,700
so

2116
05:05:20,569 --> 05:05:29,060
urgent if you don't call it like enemy omega well i'm very close so i think we're about to fight

2117
05:05:29,060 --> 05:05:40,939
uh the bad enemy the big one the scary one that uh it does sound accurate dude this room feels

2118
05:05:40,939 --> 05:05:46,779
like just this room feels like oh i'm just begging for a boss fight in here up top there's gonna be

2119
05:05:46,779 --> 05:05:50,459
it really was so dark in the last game actually i remember we had some of the fights in rooms

2120
05:05:50,459 --> 05:06:01,099
like this you couldn't see anything huh well we can really only go one way not really at all

2121
05:06:01,099 --> 05:06:07,619
actually do we have to keep going down we might have to keep going this way uh aren't they below

2122
05:06:07,619 --> 05:06:13,619
us according to the mini map i mean this we can we can go this way i think we have to keep going

2123
05:06:13,619 --> 05:06:21,580
the direction we were coming hopefully there's no fall damage so back towards me let's see if

2124
05:06:21,580 --> 05:06:33,220
you're right it's just on the other side of the map i'll be there in a moment it's just no i don't

2125
05:06:33,220 --> 05:06:46,540
see anything are we i think we might be lost in the tunnels should do this for us is that a dead end

2126
05:06:51,029 --> 05:07:00,380
oh down here oh that's just wrapped around really yeah i think it was the other way

2127
05:07:02,409 --> 05:07:12,819
but we came from that way did we so hold on split up hand hurts so much with splitting up actually

2128
05:07:12,819 --> 05:07:17,779
help if we get lost and can't find each other anyway there's nothing over here so it has to be

2129
05:07:17,779 --> 05:07:30,979
that way is there like a map of any kind up top right well i know that okay it's not what i was

2130
05:07:30,979 --> 05:07:40,740
asking maybe we just have to keep going that way wait what about over here can this is this kind

2131
05:07:40,740 --> 05:07:47,290
of like let's be shot down uh it just looks like a dead end is this just a dead end it looks like

2132
05:07:48,250 --> 05:07:55,750
this water here the x button so are they all up or down according to the mini map

2133
05:07:56,389 --> 05:08:03,029
that's a great question because there's like a line pointing up

2134
05:08:08,889 --> 05:08:16,360
and i'm about to be right under or above them i'm not sure which think we're going the right

2135
05:08:17,240 --> 05:08:25,509
way we are going there they are they're right here well i would have got there first i'm sorry

2136
05:08:25,509 --> 05:08:40,069
that was all my fault and it's a frog do you guys forgive me yeah it's comically uh inaccurate

2137
05:08:42,009 --> 05:08:57,610
watch out they're trying to get up top damn will be more monsters i just barely didn't run out of

2138
05:08:57,610 --> 05:09:13,770
the fuel there i can't see anything no idea what's happening annihilate that's all you need to know

2228
05:23:05,240 --> 05:23:13,610
something new every single mission i don't well you switch classes i don't like i stopped

2229
05:23:13,610 --> 05:23:20,009
getting new things like 10 missions ago because we're not playing on the harder

2230
05:23:20,009 --> 05:23:26,680
difficult since i've switched i've gotten nothing new well i got something new every mission so

2231
05:23:26,680 --> 05:23:32,119
it sounds great for you italics that's great for you i think they were jumped on skill so

2232
05:23:32,119 --> 05:23:39,830

2238
05:24:24,790 --> 05:24:33,720
possible well that's none of those kids actually the first time you fight it in edf4 it walks back

2239
05:24:33,720 --> 05:24:38,919
into the ocean and i think the mission ends yeah i think this is just like do enough damage for him

2249
05:26:26,740 --> 05:26:33,700
them up fades out how mad would you be hold on i think we've got some reinforcements here

05:26:34,419 --> 05:26:40,099
there are a lot of humans on the ground all of a sudden can you imagine this on inferno

2252
05:27:04,520 --> 05:27:11,450
him i mean it's not hard it's very difficult for him to hit you well you say that but okay i

2253
05:27:11,450 --> 05:27:22,419

2256
05:27:43,349 --> 05:27:46,419
enemy on earth just look how big he is

2257
05:27:53,000 --> 05:27:59,240

2260
05:28:28,840 --> 05:28:39,029
better than sea of beads when they play all the instruments at the same time so when do they

2261
05:28:39,029 --> 05:28:47,180
bring in like a new uh instead of small arms fire i don't even know where i just went is that

2262
05:28:47,180 --> 05:28:52,419
just i framed that are there any i friends in the dog it's really actually the dark souls of

2263
05:28:53,540 --> 05:29:01,220
monster games you get a mech that's big enough to fight him really as a fincer as the air raider

2264
05:29:01,779 --> 05:29:07,860
oh but you said you like i know i'm saying like i'm just saying you as a player like we as as a

2265
05:29:07,860 --> 05:29:13,659
team is he gonna jump can we do like a mega zord where we each sit in one of the seats

2266
05:29:14,299 --> 05:29:22,200
i wish come on i'm waiting for you to do something come on jump i too am waiting for something to

2267
05:29:22,200 --> 05:29:33,819
happen where's it going jump move you tell me i gotta throw this already jump here we go i've

2268

been at like 10 health for a long time now yes me as well 72 after yawning there are way more

2269
05:29:53,419 --> 05:29:59,900
verses to the song how do you get to them hey honestly ask yourself this as you're shooting

2270
05:29:59,900 --> 05:30:04,139
him you see how many people are shooting at him how much dps do you think you're adding

2271
05:30:06,139 --> 05:30:10,540
like what percentage of dps compared to the amount of npcs there are well depends on if

2272
05:30:10,540 --> 05:30:16,709
they nerf the npcs or are they as strong as the player that's what i'm saying this on inferno is

2273
05:30:16,709 --> 05:30:26,659
just like how the fuck are you supposed to do this retreat uh pick me up i killed myself no i didn't

2274
05:30:26,659 --> 05:30:35,580
for health i'm good bye hi thank you he's running away don't worry he's retreating he's retreating

2275
05:30:35,580 --> 05:30:39,740
retreated the monster and then he leaves that was easy oh yeah i'm gonna get out of here

2276
05:30:40,459 --> 05:30:47,860
yeah well we need to retreat okay it's leaving yeah well he heard how scared we were and then

2277
05:30:47,860 --> 05:30:50,659
he said look i'm gonna go terrorize someone else he only cares about fear

2278
05:30:51,459 --> 05:30:57,619
ah he was in our dreams or maybe maybe it's one of those scenarios where it's like honey i shrunk

2279
05:30:57,619 --> 05:31:02,740
the kids or he doesn't even know we exist he's just kind of walking around oh i i got level zero

2287
05:32:07,270 --> 05:32:18,330
what's the damage on this 250 plasma cannon is more than this and it's only oh yeah you can use

05:32:49,720 --> 05:32:57,939
city and destroys it do you still win yeah i'll try the lightning bow again who cares about those

2292
05:33:01,580 --> 05:33:06,630
turn off your webcam i know the joke is you're you're trying to get me to think

2293
05:33:06,630 --> 05:33:11,830
my webcam is on so i go oh fuck and i press the webcam button to turn it off but that turns it on

2294
05:33:13,400 --> 05:33:19,720
but you have to remember i have a preview of whatever is on the stream over here on a monitor

2295
05:33:19,720 --> 05:33:28,540
so i already know what's on the stream i'm playing from my stream view personally are you actually

2296
05:33:29,580 --> 05:33:35,799
yeah really why there's no delay what do you have for a capture card

2297
05:33:39,779 --> 05:33:46,099
live gamer extreme hd or something the live gamer extreme yeah it's really uh

2298
05:33:52,860 --> 05:34:04,599
live gamer extreme hd 2 hd 2 uh i just remember the beast level with the weird robots that lasted

2299
05:34:04,599 --> 05:34:16,790
like 40 minutes for that one that was the worst level you just bought the same 100 robots and the

2300
05:34:16,790 --> 05:34:22,630
you had to like go across there's other mission to destroy ant hills like oh the beach that's

2301
05:34:22,630 --> 05:34:27,270
what you meant yeah i fucking love the beach level i've played the beach level over and over

2302
05:34:27,270 --> 05:34:35,830
and over again me and arcade and played the beach level like a hundred times well here we are enjoy

2303
05:34:36,549 --> 05:34:48,819
so what's so good about this nothing oh i didn't do as much as i wanted to i'll be honest

2304
05:34:51,240 --> 05:34:57,750
it's like the air raid is doing the majority of the damage here yeah what's new the beach level

2305
05:34:58,869 --> 05:35:13,139
please reply please respond i sent a message at least 10 minutes ago please respond all right well

2306
05:35:13,139 --> 05:35:25,750
these guns suck like just terrible they are lower level but whatever so yeah now i remember why you

2307
05:35:25,750 --> 05:35:32,470
like the beach level because it drops a ton well yeah you get a shit ton of loot and there's just

2308
05:35:32,470 --> 05:35:39,060
so much stuff to fight are we playing the same game i'm confused what do you mean i didn't what

2309
05:35:39,060 --> 05:35:45,700
is this this is edf5 right yeah no the beach level was different the other one was it

2310
05:35:46,500 --> 05:35:55,459
i mean they do kind of bleed together but do you happen to know what did they change

2311
05:35:56,180 --> 05:36:03,049
i mean it's definitely new stuff no this is very different you don't i know i'm just i'm making a

2312
05:36:03,049 --> 05:36:09,130
statement well not very i don't want to say it's very different but yeah i'm just making a statement

2313
05:36:09,130 --> 05:36:12,729
if the last one was edf 4.1 this one's like 4.3

2314
05:36:16,250 --> 05:36:20,150
hey you don't know what's in the end game could be anything

2315
05:36:20,869 --> 05:36:35,380
i'm not sure these are going very far oh okay i'm gonna sneeze i hope you're ready for it

2316
05:36:36,180 --> 05:36:47,979
i can't mute because you heard the man hide behind the tanks let them handle

2317
05:36:48,619 --> 05:37:04,389
big boy job that sounded like something in the game dude if i don't get a new weapon this time

2318
05:37:04,389 --> 05:37:08,470
i'm gonna complain about it and sound like a whining loser put it on the forums for the game

2319
05:37:09,430 --> 05:37:18,580
forum complain to the devs okay they'll fix it before it becomes out of beta i remember this

2320
05:37:18,580 --> 05:37:23,939
this level is it goes pretty quick though doesn't it so i have to like be on top of this i mean

2321
05:37:23,939 --> 05:37:33,259
there could be another wave i don't know i'm gonna need to move the fuck around because this level

2322
05:37:33,259 --> 05:37:45,900
was just a shitload from this it's pretty similar i'm very stuck honestly it no it's not the same

2323
05:37:45,900 --> 05:37:52,380
map but like no we're really trying to be the same mission i will let you get that gun because

2324
05:37:52,380 --> 05:37:57,419
it's very far away i'm just kind of skating around collecting the things that i can get

2325
05:37:58,779 --> 05:38:09,130
it's over okay so how do i do the full song of what's apparently there's a full song

2326
05:38:10,869 --> 05:38:13,189
if you do it around other soldiers they sing it with you

2327
05:38:14,150 --> 05:38:20,009
oh i ran out of power you might be in the gesture of d-pad options

2328
05:38:21,529 --> 05:38:31,099
it's probably a bad time for this and i'm i can't move oh hey i think i got most of them

2329
05:38:31,659 --> 05:38:35,700
yeah i deserve that i don't know i know i deserve this

2330
05:38:41,020 --> 05:38:51,639
holy shit god that was oh my goodness that was a lot danger close oh what happened again i got hit

2331
05:38:51,639 --> 05:39:10,009
again you can get in the mech if you want i'm calling a lot of air strikes oh okay i need to

2332
05:39:10,009 --> 05:39:19,720
get some shit oh don't grab me he's right above me who is able to stand against the enemies

2333
05:39:19,720 --> 05:39:26,860
the situation is becoming more we have the upper hand yes it is the situation has become stagnant

2334
05:39:26,860 --> 05:39:37,819
i'm gonna go back to the beach to collect yeah make sure you persist i'm being very persistent

2335
05:39:37,819 --> 05:39:42,250
on my collection

2336
05:39:45,979 --> 05:39:51,099
yeah one of the classes does just kind of call airstrikes what do we have for like a standard

2337
05:39:51,099 --> 05:39:57,020
weapon do you have do you have a standard weapon um they have the limbic guns which is like you

2338
05:39:57,020 --> 05:40:02,700
shoot detonatable explosives and they have like smaller airstrikes they can call them like

2339
05:40:02,700 --> 05:40:07,580
individual ones that reload pretty quickly but uh the way the airstrikes work is when

2340
05:40:08,939 --> 05:40:12,619
they take points to call in and you get points for killing things so these missions where there's

2341
05:40:12,619 --> 05:40:20,700
like a thousand ants like every airstrike refills your airstrike that's cool that's very cool

2342
05:40:27,029 --> 05:40:32,069
all right i think i got most i'm having a bunch of these like flying girls dancing like flying

2343
05:40:32,069 --> 05:40:37,830
all over my giant mech saying party time wow i'm married and it's really hard right now

2344
05:40:37,990 --> 05:40:43,099
made it in time is it we suffered heavy casualties we saved several survivors

2345
05:40:45,720 --> 05:40:53,290
well see if ashley wants to get in on it so you know that she doesn't she never does

2346
05:40:57,029 --> 05:41:00,069
look at all those weapons i got for us do you see how many i picked up

2347
05:41:00,790 --> 05:41:10,040
oh i got i got some it says new i got new stuff for other classes so did i

2348
05:41:10,119 --> 05:41:23,259

2355
05:42:28,340 --> 05:42:42,599
really good oh dude the suppressed gun and then the grid shot 116 118

2356
05:42:43,720 --> 05:42:53,849

indoors or something i had a whole bunch of airstrikes what are we doing up here i don't know

2360
05:43:20,330 --> 05:43:29,380
this is a very ugly mission though well it's night time so that oh i see the frogs frogs

2361
05:43:29,380 --> 05:43:38,360
i don't have any booster yeah just like sitting over here they're just this is their natural

2362
05:43:38,360 --> 05:43:48,650
habitat man all the way down i've destroyed all the industry mission complete see if we can

2363
05:43:48,650 --> 05:44:09,110
lock on that was pretty cool yeah god oh i can't just stand still like that i guess he's dead

2364
05:44:09,830 --> 05:44:17,580
because the rocket stopped yeah it is midnight it's too late oh yeah that's growing red i keep

2365
05:44:17,580 --> 05:44:29,220
forgetting that you were two hours behind you yeah but it's not that means i haven't like gotten to

2366
05:44:29,220 --> 05:44:41,180
shoot at something yet well then maybe you should try harder it's pretty good no i'll get that guy

2367
05:44:41,180 --> 05:44:53,479

2368
05:44:53,479 --> 05:44:59,959
many people here that one hit this air shot i have to log on to them one at a time i want a better

2369
05:44:59,959 --> 05:45:06,650
version of this i want this thing at level three or something yeah this one was like even more

2370
05:45:06,650 --> 05:45:09,930
rockets would be amazing this thing is so good against these guys in the head

2371
05:45:15,099 --> 05:45:27,779
how i think i'm a lot more of these you know i want a better version what the fuck is happening

2372
05:45:28,500 --> 05:45:41,130
oh dear all right i'm not going over there watch out it's gonna explode wherever you want

2373

can you believe how good this guy is whoa that didn't look good all right i'm gonna go collect

2374
05:45:59,340 --> 05:46:04,860
have fun have fun kids what was it on the game we played a long time ago where you had like somebody

2375
05:46:04,860 --> 05:46:11,909
always had to go gather stuff every few seconds like there was always someone in charge of going

2376
05:46:11,909 --> 05:46:18,569
together someone had a machine it probably was man versus machine actually yeah you had to go

2377
05:46:18,569 --> 05:46:26,180
like yeah yeah yeah plenty of time played it we played it a bunch everybody had to gather like

2378
05:46:26,180 --> 05:46:39,500
pick up the drops oh don't kill me please yeah that's a scout when the scout everyone that's how

2379
05:46:39,500 --> 05:46:49,659
you get money and the scout then gets healed and overhealed the more money he picks up damien

2380
05:46:49,659 --> 05:46:55,220
you really get out of the way where's the moat what i'm going to get the frog over here

2381
05:46:56,759 --> 05:47:01,580
so i'm not saying a lot there's a lot of frogs everywhere the one that's being annoying to me

2382
05:47:01,580 --> 05:47:08,650
this one getting this one get him the one that was marked the one that was just being annoying

2383
05:47:08,650 --> 05:47:25,750

i heard submarine yeah it's unlikely they brought submarines with them

2391
05:48:28,459 --> 05:48:32,299
to take advantage of this opportunity well they are from outer space didn't you hear him he

2392
05:48:32,299 --> 05:48:43,560
clarified that he made sure you realized that such an overkill for a spider is it wouldn't you like

2407
05:50:36,619 --> 05:50:41,740

2416
05:51:59,990 --> 05:52:07,349

2421
05:52:36,549 --> 05:52:39,349
okay what i gotta wait 30 seconds to lock on to this

2422
05:52:44,380 --> 05:52:50,970
hey it's ready there it goes this all away that was a big missile i think someone just blew it up

2423
05:52:52,090 --> 05:53:02,619
those things very good oh there it's running away it just hit a building

2424
05:53:05,139 --> 05:53:12,599
that thing was stupid that was comically slow that really was that's the worst thing ever

2425
05:53:13,400 --> 05:53:20,549
all right let me get the high ground killed all those people okay we get to use it on this

2426
05:53:20,549 --> 05:53:26,790
building up here oh my god what is shooting out here i have my bulge laser watch out for the

2427
05:53:27,349 --> 05:53:31,750
5 million cannons all shooting at the same time what is this lightning from zoos that's my bulge

2428
05:53:31,750 --> 05:53:40,299
laser the zoos cannon look at these bubble lights i mean at this point we're like

2429
05:53:40,939 --> 05:53:48,389
there's a bunch of jelly beans coming at us all right mark uh mark one of those like

2430
05:53:48,389 --> 05:53:54,700
forward cannons on the big machine are we even destroying them i don't know that's what we're

2431
05:53:54,700 --> 05:54:04,409
advancing to i think they're all shooting yeah give it 30 seconds all right i'm going in

2432
05:54:05,770 --> 05:54:13,319
oh there's too many insects oh did you already lock on to something yeah okay there's a lot more

2433
05:54:13,319 --> 05:54:17,479
swarms coming in a second wait you dropped it i had to restart because you lost the laser

2434
05:54:17,479 --> 05:54:20,700
so

2435
05:54:22,139 --> 05:54:27,340
ready and there's a mech in my way fire you firing to where you're firing towards the

2436
05:54:27,340 --> 05:54:32,380
cannons i don't know wherever he's marking it's going to shoot one of those cannons

2437
05:54:32,380 --> 05:54:38,500
all right going which one where the laser pointing can you see on its way it's wiggling around

2438
05:54:39,220 --> 05:54:49,319
hopefully it goes down where i'm trying to get a good view there it goes i think it actually

2439
05:54:49,560 --> 05:54:54,360
oh i didn't even see it it actually worked it killed that whole turret

2440
05:54:55,400 --> 05:54:59,720
that uh let's do that another 30 seconds that hey i'm already over here don't worry i'll get

2441
05:54:59,720 --> 05:55:04,919
all the turrets you guys just take care of them watch this even have guns check it ready tell me

2442
05:55:04,919 --> 05:55:10,520
when you're ready for me to paint or when you're painting i'm not doing it i'm doing my laser on

2443
05:55:10,520 --> 05:55:17,779
all these freaking hands firing my laser don't worry guys boomer mean you take care of you you

2444
05:55:17,779 --> 05:55:29,619
guys just stay you guys stay well stay you guys just stay you stay i go i can't see far enough to

2445
05:55:29,619 --> 05:55:43,669
get what is this pink was it is the pink what the other laser chases i yeah i'm pointing my laser

2446
05:55:43,669 --> 05:55:55,290
and it's going towards that how inaccurate is this gun got it got bullet drop what do

2447
05:55:55,290 --> 05:55:58,330
you mean this it is i'm i'm shooting at it right now there's a lot of these

2448
05:56:00,090 --> 05:56:08,659
it is though we've destroyed a lot of turrets that was way too low it's not working

2449
05:56:11,259 --> 05:56:17,639
i guess they mean like i have no activity whatsoever i can't even get up there is the

2450
05:56:17,639 --> 05:56:31,020
big blazer shooting no all right all the turrets that are shooting in that direction there's a

2451
05:56:31,020 --> 05:56:34,540
bunch shooting in the other direction but the ones that are shooting towards you guys are all

2452
05:56:34,540 --> 05:56:40,860
pretty much gone i'm going to take me 10 years to get over here i don't even know if i can get

2453
05:56:40,860 --> 05:56:48,680
up there i said two drums what about the big cannon should we be aiming at that

2454
05:56:49,560 --> 05:57:08,900
i wonder how effective that is are you kidding me how are you going to get up there well

2455
05:57:10,549 --> 05:57:17,619
uh-oh yeah yeah i can't get up there well here they come what is it trying to make me look at

2456
05:57:17,619 --> 05:57:34,250
drones a lot of them holy shit okay i'm gonna try to take out all the saucers that just came out

2457
05:57:41,180 --> 05:57:54,729
give them the bulge because it is one hit with this holy shit what the fuck is firing right now

2458
05:57:56,340 --> 05:58:00,340
uh which what are you talking about like a giant laser beam just came out of the sky

2459
05:58:00,419 --> 05:58:06,819
jesus christ germa that was like the first thing i asked when we started this mission but yeah

2460
05:58:06,819 --> 05:58:15,930
what i mean i i've been away from you guys the entire time i i have like a giant purple beam

2461
05:58:15,930 --> 05:58:21,209
coming down from the sky so it's not like the view distances i've been i've been taken out

2462
05:58:22,409 --> 05:58:26,729
i didn't mean to say oh he's been so busy being productive oh yeah what do you think what do you

2463
05:58:27,049 --> 05:58:32,099
think the cannons just disappeared on their own we killed like two of them just the two of us

2464
05:58:32,099 --> 05:58:37,779
well great i killed 14 look it's only because you're faster not because you're stronger okay

2465
05:58:37,779 --> 05:58:43,619
you can't wait to see your new movie that comes out soon faster not stronger what is that the

2466
05:58:43,619 --> 05:58:59,000
sonic the hedgehog movie all about you what the hell is what been asking at the whole game

2467
05:59:07,849 --> 05:59:14,180

i like green shakes anything green really yeah well that's pretty accurate there are frogs

2506
06:06:11,700 --> 06:06:18,090
this just reminds me of the scholar of the lost sins whatever it's called there's just

2507
06:06:18,090 --> 06:06:27,830

2513
06:07:30,599 --> 06:07:33,799
lots of armor good why are we naming the pylons now

2514
06:07:35,080 --> 06:07:40,860
what are they called now teleportation anchors isn't what you just said we're calling them that

2515
06:07:40,860 --> 06:07:44,619
now most you've been calling them they couldn't take the same pylons the whole game i guess well

2516
06:07:44,619 --> 06:07:48,619
no they're not called that anymore now they're called teleportation anchors well they needed to

2517
06:07:48,619 --> 06:07:52,540
research it for a few weeks we needed to change the name because it was offending some people

2518
06:07:55,930 --> 06:08:13,110
how it was insensitive i'm summoning a creep grapes do you like frozen grapes no thanks

2519
06:08:13,110 --> 06:08:23,909
they ain't no friend to me i've never had one all right red ants careful don't get grabbed

2520
06:08:24,630 --> 06:08:42,540
you must construct additional teleportation ink it's a good one chat boom no he didn't explode

2523
06:09:16,310 --> 06:09:20,500

2705
06:38:24,860 --> 06:38:28,700
indeterminate amount of time nobody knows because only the ps4 is capable of rendering these

right well i have a grenade for this i probably shouldn't play ranger you can't undone 25 that's

2724
06:41:28,299 --> 06:41:43,479

2725
06:41:44,439 --> 06:41:50,439
i don't know i don't know recently like like seriously lately i've been thinking

2726
06:41:51,240 --> 06:41:56,360
how old am i i think i'm 29 you don't know how old you are i don't know how old you are

2727
06:41:57,159 --> 06:42:01,319
you don't have you don't actually know how old you are i was doing i was doing the math like

2728
06:42:01,319 --> 06:42:07,479
a day ago there's only one generation that forgets how old they are on purpose or on accident no i'm

2729
06:42:07,479 --> 06:42:19,880
28 are you though 28 yeah i am come on i just did the math are you though i think you're all

2730
06:42:19,880 --> 06:42:28,869
the i thought you were 31 no i was born 1990 i think you just made that up is that what you're

2731
06:42:28,869 --> 06:42:39,459
the one you're the you're the only 30 here that's may be accurate uh okay oh just wait hey just wait

2732
06:42:39,459 --> 06:42:48,740
you two you two boys just wait just wait yeah hey hey two boys here uh gonna be waiting for a long

2733
06:42:48,740 --> 06:42:57,770
time i guess just you guys wait you know a couple years before you're as old as i am now yeah and

2734
06:42:57,770 --> 06:43:07,770
then you'll see what it's like to be 30 over 30 well we'll just we'll just be regular 30 and then

2735
06:43:07,770 --> 06:43:14,569
eventually over 30 yeah and you you tell me how you feel on that next day

2736
06:43:16,229 --> 06:43:22,150
well even then though you're gonna be just as much older than us as you are right now so

2737
06:43:24,939 --> 06:43:31,909
whatever oh yeah these artillery things didn't they used to be like robots but now i guess they're

2738
06:43:31,909 --> 06:43:38,090
fraud instead of robots that's right now how is this one any different than the other one i mean

2739
06:43:38,090 --> 06:43:49,580
again maybe it's more damage for long range support what's the objective kill this thing

2740
06:43:49,580 --> 06:43:57,590
is kind of good but it takes a ton of power it's not that good

2741
06:44:02,150 --> 06:44:27,380
everyone's getting old you're not old until you're forgotten my plan for this show young

2742
06:44:30,020 --> 06:44:34,419

2795
06:53:14,619 --> 06:53:21,659

2799
06:53:50,169 --> 06:53:55,130

2802
06:54:08,970 --> 06:54:13,930
all go into our own separate solo games and do the same mission and like stop talking to each other

2803
06:54:16,490 --> 06:54:21,799
animal crossing all right which one of these guns is good for killing lots of people

2857
07:03:53,180 --> 07:04:01,000
missiles per launcher it'd be good probably just requires two people to aim them yeah i cannot

2858
07:04:01,000 --> 07:04:08,630
catch up with any of these guys yeah this mission is gonna suck it is required this is gonna require

2859
07:04:08,630 --> 07:04:14,389
a lot more objective kill all the things kill it's always kill all the things yeah but they're

2860
07:04:14,389 --> 07:04:20,490
