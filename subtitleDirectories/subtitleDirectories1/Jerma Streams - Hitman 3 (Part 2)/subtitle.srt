1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:10,660
Hello. He forgot to talk. No, no, all right, all right, all right. Listen, listen, listen.

2
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:22,620
He's very early. I'm like seven minutes early. Somebody said, were you, were you all right at

3
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:32,409
the end of yesterday's stream? Yeah? Yeah, what, what do you mean? At the end of the stream? What

4
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:47,350
happened? What happened at the end of last night's stream? I don't know, what is the person talking

5
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:56,679
about? He forgets. Jesus, this is bad. Wait, wait, didn't I scream because, wait, didn't we raid

6
00:00:56,679 --> 00:01:00,979
somebody? Did we raid somebody and I like screamed because I ran out of time? Is that what you're

7
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:05,739
talking about? What happened? We didn't raid anybody last night, did we? Yes, we did. We raided

8
00:01:05,739 --> 00:01:22,870
Ludwig. Anyways, oh, by the way, I was there for Ludwig's raid song. It was fucking pretty good.

9
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,890
You guys just make everybody do the raid song. He's sitting there like,

10
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:31,480
like do the raid song, do the raid song. Keep seeing. He's like, what is the raid song? He said,

11
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,760
we don't have a raid song. You're just confusing the absolute fuck out of him.

12
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:40,329
And on the spot, he just turned on a little music file and he did a song better than anything I

13
00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:50,120
could have ever done. Do the raid song. You're just going to confuse everybody we ever raid.

14
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:05,510
We're raiding you right now. No, you're not. Yeah, I think everybody we've raided has had

15
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:14,180
to do a raid song. You guys can't just force people to do a raid song. Anyways, tonight we're

16
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:21,379
going to play Hitman 3. I'm very scared to open up the save file because I'm going to be very

17
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:27,639
honest with you. This third level, I'm just going to kill them and run to the exit. I don't like

18
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:32,860
this place. I'm going to just find the people. I'm going to kill them and run and like save state

19
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:40,520
and run out of the level. I think we also had a thing today, which I want to go over.

20
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:49,460
It was about maybe playing Hitman while a little bit high, right? And while I think that's a fun

21
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:56,759
idea, I want to make sure I let you guys know this. There's going to be no debt wiping today.

22
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:01,699
This is not going to do any debt. This is not for any reason in particular.

23
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:14,250
I don't want to incentivize like doing drugs on stream for a benefit. So if I'm going to do

24
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:20,949
anything, it's going to be because I just feel like it. I do it sometimes, but no, I don't really

25
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:25,990
like the idea of incentivizing me doing drugs. I don't think that's cool. I think that's not a

26
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:33,020
good way to, I think that's not a good start to like doing something like this. So cause like,

27
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:38,219
oh, hey, hey, hey, dude, 500 million. If you get high right now, wait, right now. Okay. Yeah.

28
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:44,460
No, that's not going to happen. So there's no incentive here. If I'm going to do it today,

29
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:52,310
I'm going to do it for fun. And that's it. So there's no, don't, there's no debt wipes or

30
00:03:52,310 --> 00:04:04,469
anything like that. Pull, pull out the what you've bong rips. No, no, no. And I'm not going to do

31
00:04:04,469 --> 00:04:11,319
that. I look, Hitman is a very complicated game. And I know a ton of you guys are going to laugh

32
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:16,470
and be like, no, it isn't. You just have to go strangle people with piano wire. I know, I know

33
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:22,550
it's not, it's, but it is this, okay. If there's more than like a hundred people in a room and I

34
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:27,430
have an apple in my hand and all the people in that room can get hit in the face by an apple,

35
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:39,379
it's incredibly complicated. There's too many, the flow chart is all over the place. So we're

36
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:45,860
going to try to do this level that I, I don't, dude, I don't remember. It was, I just walked

37
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:50,100
around in the circle for 20 minutes and said, I hate this. I hate this place. I hate cement. Delete

38
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:56,069
this level. And I couldn't figure out how to get back to the dance floor. So I'm just going to

39
00:04:56,069 --> 00:05:01,740
really try to beat this level because I want to see the rest of the game. You're no longer family

40
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:06,620
friendly. It's, you got to click the 18 plus mature audience warning. How many times do I have to say

41
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:13,860
that? How many times do I have to say that? This is a mature audience stream. We talk about mature

42
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:20,730
things here, like your favorite Yoshi character. Mine's definitely

43
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:35,259
Oshi. All right, let's go. You hit the beat. All right. I have to be ready for this. I was,

44
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:41,740
I got to, I'm trying to look the best pitchers in the major leagues. If they let up a home run,

45
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:46,889
or they let up 10 runs and they have to pitch two days later, the last one didn't even happen. You

46
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:55,939
got to delete it from your memory. Didn't even happen. So that last stream didn't happen.

47
00:05:56,579 --> 00:06:01,480
All right. Here we go. So like, I'm ready. I'm ready to pitch. I'm ready to pitch right now.

48
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:05,560
I'm ready to pitch. I got to kill that guy over there. Gun, uh, with the gun, gun, gun.

49
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:14,329
This is really loud. Hold on. Spoilers. This is level three. Yeah. We're playing hitman three,

50
00:06:14,329 --> 00:06:23,899
level three. Are you high already? No. All right. Hitman three, level three. I'm currently the DJ.

51
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:33,379
Poison. Those look pretty good. What's going on here? What's wrong with my computer? All right.

52
00:06:33,379 --> 00:06:37,240
No, don't go into this. Don't go. Don't go into the cement yet. All right. Who'd I kill?

53
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:51,019
Kill somebody who died. Did I, somebody died? Somebody just walk off a cliff. Okay. All right.

54
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:53,420
Where are you? Where? Okay. I'm going to, I'm going to kill that guy over there.

55
00:06:54,339 --> 00:07:01,560
David. Somebody died. Perfect. Holy shit. That's fucking unbelievable. All right. Thank God.

56
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,379
I only have to kill. I don't even know how many more people will. Let's go. What do I have for

57
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:11,689
weapons? I don't have any weapons. Do I? Oh, yes, I do. All right. I'm going to syringe somebody in

58
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:24,250
the neck. That's very important. I want to go. He's so good. Let's go get this guy over here.

59
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:30,459
I want to syringe this part. Put the syringe away. Wait, I thought I'm going to, I'm not allowed

60
00:07:30,459 --> 00:07:41,980
in here. Is he going to be mad that I try to come in? Tech only. Brown this guy and froth. All right.

61
00:07:41,980 --> 00:08:03,769
Hold on. There he is. I played cool. Intel. What? You want to bench press me? What the fuck? That

62
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:14,939
was Intel. Actually just kill. What do you think I'm trying to do? Okay. I'm going to follow this guy

63
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:25,500
around. That's the guy I have to kill. I'm going to syringe him in the neck and I'm going to step

64
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:30,300
on his head. This person is going to fight me. Look at this person walking up to me like they're

65
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:43,899
going to punch me in the face. Get away from me. Where are you going? Okay. So I can't do it on the

66
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:48,919
dance floor. Does he like go to the bathroom over here? All right. He goes in here. Who else is in

67
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:55,690
there? There's some tech people in there. Wait, that's two of these guys to get. Oh shit. Hold on.

68
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:03,139
They come in this little staff room. Can I go in that? Maybe I can go. Okay. I'm going to go kill

69
00:09:03,139 --> 00:09:08,259
people in the staff room first. What do you think? That's probably a good idea. Does he walk this way

70
00:09:08,259 --> 00:09:15,220
or that way? God damn it. I hate this place. I'm really thinking about just going for stabbing

71
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,779
him in the neck and then running and stabbing the other guy in the neck and then killing the other

72
00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:33,429
guy and then stabbing. I just want to kill both these guys right now. Shut up. Does he only walk?

73
00:09:33,429 --> 00:09:40,149
All right. I need to get in this. Can I sneak around him? All right. He goes in here. His path

74
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:55,210
goes in here. What's in here? I need a key card. The DJ is just following a guy around.

75
00:09:55,769 --> 00:10:07,450
There has to be a creative way I can kill this guy, right? I'm going to syringe him in the neck

76
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:11,029
and run. What else am I going to do? I don't know. Look, I know there's probably an elaborate way.

77
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:27,700
Just do it and run. I just want to see if this guy's path is just a circle on the dance floor

78
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:35,820
because if it is, then we have to drop a chandelier on his head. That's the one thing I wasn't doing

79
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:40,120
last time. I wasn't following their individual paths around. Where's he going? Okay. There he

80
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:50,710
goes. Where's this at? Where's this at? Where's this at? Opportunity coming up. Probably right

81
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:59,110
here. I should have done it right there. Oh my God. Can I throw a beer bottle?

82
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:08,500
Fuck. Are you talking about? God damn it, dude. Really? Shut up. Don't point. Don't point. Hide

83
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:17,769
and seek. Don't point at me. How could you? You don't know that I'm the DJ. I'm the DJ.

84
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:22,649
You want to? You're going to? That's just random guy here is the guy that you're going to

85
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:26,570
give information to. You came here to see me tonight. Don't you want to make me happy?

86
00:11:28,980 --> 00:12:03,190
He's dead. Here's the broom. Who's shooting? I'm just going to go fucking kill this guy. I'm

87
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:06,309
just going to go syringe him. I don't care. I don't like this level. I don't. I don't like

88
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:28,889
this level. I'm just going to go syringe him. Who is this? Is that one of them? How could?

89
00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:43,539
Oh my fucking God. I hate this level. Where is it? Right here? Just use a gun. I don't have

90
00:12:43,539 --> 00:13:00,950
a gun. The syringe doesn't kill them. I'm just going to fucking sprint. I'm allowed to be here.

91
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:16,820
I'm the DJ. What do you mean? What am I doing back here? This is my set. You're on my set.

92
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:33,639
What do you mean they see through you? They see 3PO. What? They see through you.

93
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,720
Hey, what are you doing back here? You're not supposed to be back here. Oh, by the way,

94
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:50,340
I loved the last song you played. You'll be paying me in the parking lot, right?

95
00:13:50,340 --> 00:14:20,379
Oh, I did it again. Oh my God. I hate this level. I have to beat this level.

96
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:34,519
I hate this place. Where's my opportunities? I don't have any intel. I need my intel.

97
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:44,519
There's no good things to do. I just have to follow these people around and then kill them.

98
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:59,240
There's like 3,000 people here. Entitled streamer needs his intel. Where's my intel?

99
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:07,799
You know what? I'm going to go after that guy up there. Fuck this.

100
00:15:11,669 --> 00:15:14,309
Where are the opportunities? No, there's no opportunities because this is not like an

101
00:15:14,309 --> 00:15:19,580
assassin mission. This is just going to avoid the red guy but kill the red guy.

102
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:37,820
There's no assassination here. I'm going up there. All right. I'm going to go up. I'm

103
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:45,419
going to wait for his path to go up that way. Why are you already mad? I hate this level.

104
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:59,559
This guy's got a bodyguard with him too. All right. You know what? Do I have any grenades?

105
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:07,179
I'm throwing a grenade in that room. He's going to come through here. Hold on. This

106
00:16:07,179 --> 00:16:10,500
is my opportunity right here. I'm going to save it right here. Watch this shit.

107
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:41,620
I'm going to get one right here. Come on. Walk through here. He's zonked and naked.

108
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:58,809
Does he take a right or take a left? I think he takes a right. Here he comes.

109
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:17,049
Where's my intel? I need that. Look, I know. I'm one of those... Wait, this guy's number six,

110
00:17:17,049 --> 00:17:26,359
but I'm not allowed to be... Wait a minute. Do they like me now? No. Put that back on.

111
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:31,400
Look, I know. I'm one of those people that I'm playing hitman. You got to play it the real way.

112
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:37,960
You know, you can't have any intel, no blue markers on the map, but I'm sorry. I need those.

113
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:43,450
I need you to show me where the thing to drop the chandelier is. I need it.

114
00:17:44,089 --> 00:17:51,859
Let me go up. They just walk up and round a circle. All right. This guy's dead.

115
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:57,420
I'm going to cut this guy off in the concrete up here, and I'm going to kill him.

116
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:06,069
Could I disguise as somebody else that he trusts or something and lure him away or take him

117
00:18:06,069 --> 00:18:13,109
somewhere or do something? I feel like I don't have anything to do. There was the electrocute

118
00:18:13,109 --> 00:18:29,819
the guy with the tree. What are the things going to do to these guys? They just walk around up

119
00:18:29,819 --> 00:18:39,339
here. All right. I might be able to kill him over there. I can come back here. Yeah. That's the

120
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:45,099
play. The play here is I'm going to brick. Okay. This is the play. I got it. These two guys walk

121
00:18:45,099 --> 00:18:48,299
down here. I'm going to wait. They're going to cycle over here. I'm going to hide right here.

122
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:53,269
I'm going to brick the first guy and I'm going to punch him. What will kill them? Definitely.

123
00:18:53,269 --> 00:18:56,710
Crowbar? A knife. All right. I'm going to stab him. I'm going to stab him in the head.

124
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:16,759
Did they walk back this way? If they do, I'll hide over here. I just don't want these techs to see

125
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:31,559
this. He's definitely ADHD. Too much to wait that long. Oh, I don't like this. I like the 47. This

126
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:39,849
is Diana here. Here we have a Bingleberry Tingleberry, an oil rig, a machinery extraordinaire.

127
00:19:39,849 --> 00:19:44,250
He's welled up in his panta. I don't want to just wait around and follow the fucking red outline guy.

128
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:58,490
No, I hate this. I don't like this level. Just go kill them. I tried that. Every single person in

129
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:13,019
this dance floor has a gun. They just start firing at me. I really might be too ADHD to wait this

130
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:21,349
long. I have to wait this long. Kill one and take their gun. That's the plan. The plan is when this

131
00:20:21,349 --> 00:20:25,430
guy dies, I'm going to stab him in the throat. No, first of all, I have two of these. I'm going

132
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:30,339
to throw the knife into his face and then kill his partner. I'm going to take his gun. I'm going to

133
00:20:30,339 --> 00:20:32,740
lean over the edge. I'm going to shoot that guy in the fucking head and then I'm going to go to the

134
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:48,859
exit. This is going to take so long. In fact, I could probably just do this right now. Can I reach

135
00:20:48,859 --> 00:20:54,980
from here? Wait, can I reach from here? Nobody will know what it is. Nobody will know if I can

136
00:20:54,980 --> 00:21:07,349
get it from here. No, it does not. Okay. All right. Here they come. Where are they? Where do you go?

137
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:18,809
There he is. Okay. I'm ready. I'm going to be ready for the save it so I don't fuck this up.

138
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:25,559
There are five guards. No, there's not. There's four. Wouldn't I have found the other one by now?

139
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:29,480
If there's a fifth guard, if I have to walk around and just stand next to people until

140
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:35,210
one of them puts a thing on their ear, I'm not going to be happy at all.

141
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:50,569
There are five. Great. Got to get up here already. This is awful gameplay. I don't, I look, this is

142
00:21:50,569 --> 00:21:57,779
probably the worst hitman gameplay you're ever going to see. You could put a headset on your dog

143
00:21:57,779 --> 00:22:05,049
and put the mouse on their paw and then put a treat in the air and the movement from the tail

144
00:22:05,049 --> 00:22:12,359
wagging, the moving, and their paws going back and forth would probably kill both these guys.

145
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:22,390
All right. Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait a minute. Is he alone? They're both

146
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:28,180
coming up here. Can I get a double? Here we go. Here we go. This is important. I got two of these.

147
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:32,150
I'm going to throw one in his head. Let Otto play. Hey, tiger. Thanks for the vibe. Give me

148
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:41,160
it or these apps. You're just standing there. Yeah, I'm being an assassin. Assassins wait for

149
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:53,799
their prey. Come on. Just walk down here. This is a nice concrete stream. Don't even get me

150
00:22:53,799 --> 00:23:04,039
started on that concrete. Where is he? Why is he walking that way? They're going to come this way.

151
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:11,670
You're a camper. I have to get out of this level. I did. I need to beat this level because if I skip

152
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:20,490
this level, like a lot of people have said, then I didn't beat hitman three. Here they come. Don't

153
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:30,700
walk all the way down. Take a right. There we go. Okay. Here we go. You play the other games. You

154
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,579
should know how to play this one. This is the first time they've done a mission like this

155
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:38,180
where there's no target. You just have to like wait around and like fucking kill the guy.

156
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:52,660
I'm ready. This is it. Are you ready? First time. Here we go. First try. One, two. Who? What? Who is

157
00:23:52,660 --> 00:24:19,750
it? Get off. Get off cover. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Where is he? No. Did anybody hear the shot?

158
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:53,980
No. Nobody else come up here. What? He was two people. He just dead ringered. Kill that spy.

159
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:12,950
I'm done. I'm done. I'm skipping the level. I'm skipping the level. Why did he hear it? He

160
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:31,000
shouldn't have heard it. That was so stupid. You got face stabbed. Okay. Well, obviously they see

161
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:37,849
this, so I need to move. I have to wait even a little longer. This is surprising if this guy's

162
00:25:37,849 --> 00:26:22,940
standing here, right? Don't shoot. Who found it? Oh my God. I hate this place. You fucking suck.

163
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:27,900
Stop saying that. It's making me unconscious. It's making me self-conscious. Stop saying that.

164
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:47,259
I need to move. Hold on. Here's the play. Here's the play. Here's the play. Ready?

165
00:26:47,259 --> 00:26:55,539
Will he see me or is he stupid? He's too dumb, right? Too dumb. No. I want to stab him with the

166
00:26:55,539 --> 00:27:16,009
fucking syringe. What are you doing? Oh my God. No, no, no, no, no. He's arresting me.

167
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:55,210
I'm being arrested. Oh shit. I'm being arrested. All right. I'm good. Eliminate agents too.

168
00:27:56,859 --> 00:28:06,730
That guy's fucking alive. What do you mean? He's alive. He's alive. He's not alive. Oh my God.

169
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:13,829
He's alive. No, no, no, no, no. I didn't take his knife. Oh my fucking God. Are you kidding me?

170
00:28:29,619 --> 00:28:48,140
Get the fuck out of here. Leave. What the fuck? Oh shit. I have to hide in the locker.

171
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:52,619
Is there a locker over here? Oh my God. I'm in so much trouble. I'm in so much trouble.

172
00:28:53,339 --> 00:29:15,430
Oh my God. He has to die. That guy has to die right now. No one will hear it, right?

173
00:29:33,369 --> 00:29:41,029
No, no, no. That guy has to die. That guy has to die. No, this guy has to die. He's fucking naked.

174
00:29:45,509 --> 00:29:48,950
No, the other guy. The other guy. The other guy. The other guy. The other guy. The other guy.

175
00:29:48,950 --> 00:30:18,980
There he is. Thank you. Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick. I need new clothes. Montgomery Burns?

176
00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:40,259
Wait, we're clearing the place out. Get back in here. Get in here. Come in here. Thank you.

177
00:30:40,259 --> 00:30:45,269
Oh my God. Why did you open that fucking door? Why did you open that door? Why did you open

178
00:30:45,269 --> 00:30:49,430
this door? You're supposed to be clearing out the facility, not opening doors to like staff rooms.

179
00:30:49,430 --> 00:31:11,289
I need a new clothes. Just evacuate. I'm compromised. I need new clothes. Everybody

180
00:31:11,289 --> 00:31:27,799
knows me. Ow. Every single person here knows who I am now. This is like Batman dropping down with

181
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:42,150
the Batman costume on. Oh, I'm fucking in tons of trouble here. I think I'm in... I just messed

182
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:49,609
everything up. I have nowhere to go. I just blew it so bad. I can't go anywhere. Can I stand up and

183
00:31:49,609 --> 00:32:04,869
grab that? Stand up. Why can I not stand up? Just go and kill. I... All right. I can't even stand up.

184
00:32:04,869 --> 00:32:15,500
Whatever. I don't care. Save it here. I think I'm all right. Holy shit. Nobody saw. All right. Good,

185
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:25,289
good, good, good, good. I got two tech people down there. There's one dude over there. Oh,

186
00:32:25,289 --> 00:32:37,529
nice. Okay. Who's here? Okay. Perfect. There's no one else in this room. I need to lure these two

187
00:32:37,529 --> 00:33:51,339
over. I don't even... I don't have no idea. Wait. That's... There he is. Oh, no. What? I didn't even

188
00:33:51,339 --> 00:34:17,579
put him on. I have to find the last person. I have to find the last person. Intel. The drug dealer

189
00:34:17,579 --> 00:34:22,920
is apparently supplying some of the staff and security... Where was this? I can't follow that.

190
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:38,280
Where's my blue marker for that? Wait. Is that right below me? Is that the drug dealer right

191
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:48,900
there? Where's the drug dealer? It's my Intel. Drug dealer. He's got a red hat on. There he is.

192
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:55,179
Oh, God. That's the drug dealer. Okay. I need a new costume. Follow that guy. Follow the guy in

193
00:34:55,179 --> 00:35:28,380
the red hat. Save it here. Follow that guy in the red hat. There he is. Where's he going? Destroy

194
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:35,800
that guy. I need a new outfit. This one's already compromised. I have to lure... Oh, you up there.

195
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,989
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

196
00:35:39,989 --> 00:35:43,690
Get him. Get this motherfucker right now before he goes upstairs. Go, go, go, go, go, go. Get him,

197
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:45,849
get him, get him, get him, get him, get him, get him, get him, get him, get him, get him, get him.

198
00:35:45,849 --> 00:36:11,460
I want to follow... I want to do a mission. Follow the drug dealer. There he is. Okay. There's somebody

199
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:16,760
in here does not know... Can see right through me. He's not in the room though. Okay. What's going on

200
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:30,019
here with these drugs? Apparently busy. I was getting killed by a derma in Team Fortress 2

201
00:36:30,019 --> 00:36:38,519
last night. Was it you? What happened? Am I searching what? What do you mean searching?

202
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:56,099
I don't understand. Searching for what? Okay. How many fucking times? He's still alive?

203
00:36:56,739 --> 00:37:16,019
Where's this last person? Look at the link, please. Literally just you're in a bad trip. I'm fine.

204
00:37:16,019 --> 00:37:29,050
Look at it. Look at it. Mission stories. Just click this. Oh, my God, derma. What? Hold on.

205
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:41,320
What do you mean? Just click this. Just click this. Mission stories. The game's like crashing.

206
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:56,090
Mission stories. Not available for this mission. It's a really good game. It's a really good...

207
00:37:56,090 --> 00:38:06,699
Where's this last person? It's probably you. Is it you? I don't care if I get a zero in

208
00:38:06,699 --> 00:38:22,619
this mission. I don't care. Where'd he go? Where'd you go? What? Did they find this body?

209
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:34,900
Who found this body? It said searching. Does he turn around and come down here? Let's find out.

210
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:47,320
Why did it say searching? I shot someone. No, no, no. When I went to the drug dealer,

211
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:53,559
it said, oh, searching now. I didn't do anything. He got scared. I think somebody comes up these

212
00:38:53,559 --> 00:39:13,539
stairs and sees him. Okay. Found him. Found him. I just karate chopped his neck. Okay. I think I'm

213
00:39:13,539 --> 00:39:37,940
in a clear now. Talk to the drug dealer. Drug dealer. Hi. What's up? Ask about buying drugs.

214
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:47,860
Follow me. I can't go that way. I can't. Can we go a different way? Can we go a different way? I

215
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:56,500
can't go... I know somebody here. I don't want them to see me here. I don't want them to see

216
00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:02,500
we went to the same club on the same night. I literally texted this person that I wasn't

217
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:07,139
around tonight, that I had family in town. Okay. So fucking come on. Can we go a different way?

218
00:40:20,659 --> 00:40:55,179
Thanks. How do I syringe him? What's wrong with him? Why is he not falling down? This guy,

219
00:40:55,179 --> 00:41:02,469
I think this guy does a lot of drugs. So like, it's not going to make him fall down. I think

220
00:41:02,469 --> 00:41:21,860
he'll be okay in like five minutes. I can't kill. I feel kind of like, I can't hurt this guy.

221
00:41:50,219 --> 00:41:54,059
How did I break it? I just stabbed him and I was trying to take his clothes.

222
00:42:04,329 --> 00:42:10,300
He's stupid. I wanted to subdue him so I could take his clothes and hide his body because I'm

223
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:13,820
the drug dealer now and I can go to one of the staff members with the drugs. He was sitting there

224
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:25,369
going... The game was glitched. I couldn't even get out of it. So I had to shoot the guy. I gave

225
00:42:25,369 --> 00:42:48,070
that plenty of time for that to work itself out and it didn't. So I had to shoot him. I had to.

226
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:58,460
Don't sell me the drugs right here. What are you stupid? Can I save it here? Okay. Thank God.

227
00:42:58,539 --> 00:43:03,289
Oh, Richard Nixon impression. Sure.

228
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:16,869
There. That'll be a thousand dollars. In joke currency, fake money. Not real money.

229
00:43:16,869 --> 00:43:34,619
Why does he drop it on the ground? You notice that? So give it to me. Oh, right. He wants money.

230
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:54,650
That's what I wanted to have happen last time. Get silent. Somebody will hear me if I stab him.

231
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:03,539
Okay. I'm now the drug dealer. So now I have to walk up to one of these guys and sell drugs to him.

232
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:14,199
Okay. Which one of these guys does the drugs? Let's see if it's you.

233
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:33,510
I have something for you. You might like... You think that... Why wouldn't he? He should put on

234
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:40,780
like a... Put a voice on, right? 47 never puts a voice on. Every time you disguise, he's just like,

235
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:46,150
yes, I'm here. The chef ready to serve you. You think if he was an assassin like that,

236
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:52,820
why wouldn't you put a voice on? Put a voice on. Okay. And would you like some drugs?

237
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:59,400
Why do I have to just speak my normal voice? This guy doesn't want any drugs, I don't think.

238
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:16,380
At some point, I've never been recorded. And if I'm the most incredible assassin in the world,

239
00:45:17,099 --> 00:45:21,820
nobody picked me up. I'm like a microphone in an office complex being like,

240
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:27,639
the job is done. I just blew it. I got too close. I was talking.

241
00:45:27,639 --> 00:45:51,590
The game crashed. It's a hard crash. I have to... Oh, god damn it. Okay.

242
00:46:01,349 --> 00:46:19,079
Oops. I think that was just... You just walked directly in front.

243
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:23,320
I was so quick that you wouldn't even be able to avoid it if you wanted to.

244
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:34,010
Did that person lean in? Was that person over my shoulder with a stretched out neck being like,

245
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:38,170
hey, what's happening over here? Like Beetlejuice style? Like a long neck?

246
00:46:38,889 --> 00:46:52,199
Hey, yeah. Whoa. Bang. Like, I don't understand. Watch the clip. The hitscan was behind you. What?

247
00:46:57,159 --> 00:47:02,250
No, hold on. I actually do want to see how this happened. At some point...

248
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:28,730
Let's see. See how this played out. Okay. Let's see. So, I'm walking around.

249
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:34,119
Like, at some point, I've never been recorded. And if I'm the most

250
00:47:34,679 --> 00:47:40,039
incredible assassin in the world, nobody picked me up. I'm like a microphone in an

251
00:47:40,039 --> 00:47:46,260
office complex being like, the job is done. I just blew it. Who is this person?

252
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:48,820
I got too close. I don't see... It was a lady, right? Is this lady right here?

253
00:47:52,599 --> 00:47:57,800
What happened? What? I just blew it. I got too close. I was talking.

254
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:04,980
There she is. She walks forward. The gun is out. The gun is in front of me.

255
00:48:05,619 --> 00:48:11,510
And I shoot her directly in the head. It's like I held the gun up and pointed my wrist

256
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:19,860
backwards and just blew her head off. What? I got too close. I was talking.

257
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:23,300
This is one of those scenarios where this is the assassin behind me.

258
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:26,739
And this is just a big show with this guy in front of me.

259
00:48:26,739 --> 00:48:37,800
She's coming up to kill me. Wrist back kill. The bullet is from the camera.

260
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:48,699
Third person game. Let's go. Let me turn it up too. It's a little low.

261
00:48:48,699 --> 00:48:58,739
The hitscan is from the camera. Well, I guess we figured that out.

262
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:03,619
Where's the save point? 17 right here. Where is it? Yeah.

263
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:21,559
Hmm. This game is zonked. When are you going to get high?

264
00:49:23,269 --> 00:49:28,789
Look, relax. When am I going to... Hey, I'm only here for the guy to get high.

265
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:33,219
Yeah. I mean, I heard that this dude was going to just get high today.

266
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:38,070
That's the only reason why I showed up. Wait. Why does the guy have a...

267
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:51,429
The drug dealer has a key card? I may or may not be currently partaking.

268
00:49:51,429 --> 00:49:55,110
You don't know. And I'm doing it on my own for my own amusement.

269
00:49:55,110 --> 00:50:04,250
What is even back here? Okay. So this dude right here does not care about drugs

270
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:08,489
because he literally... I followed him around for a minute or two.

271
00:50:08,489 --> 00:50:13,420
Okay. I can't unlock this door. Yes, I can. Oh, no, I can't.

272
00:50:16,739 --> 00:50:20,019
Let me guess. The person that wants the drugs is somebody I've already killed.

273
00:50:20,019 --> 00:50:26,440
Let me guess. We get to do the fun thing where we now walk around in circles until somebody goes,

274
00:50:27,639 --> 00:50:33,659
yeah, I'm looking for him. I don't see him. Out of the 5,000 people here.

275
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:52,739
Why are you dressed up as Paddington Bear? I don't know, man.

276
00:50:55,690 --> 00:50:57,530
Okay. So I don't think it's anybody else on the dance floor.

277
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:06,099
We're looking for a girl. The fifth agent is a girl.

278
00:51:06,099 --> 00:51:14,010
Does the guy want drugs? Get out of here. Looking for a girl.

279
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:48,789
Who are you? Approach. What? I really think it's one of the people back here.

280
00:51:48,789 --> 00:51:51,829
I did not explore this way yet. I got to find this last person.

281
00:51:52,550 --> 00:52:09,190
Why not? Hey, hey, vouch for me. Vouch for me. Look, I'm with the tech.

282
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:19,769
Can you vouch for me? Can you say something, please? Say something.

283
00:52:21,929 --> 00:52:25,530
Or I'm going to blow this up right now and say that I'm selling you drugs. Say something.

284
00:52:27,219 --> 00:52:37,289
Hey, Bob Richardson is buying drugs from me. Say it. Let us in. Let us in. Are you really trying

285
00:52:37,289 --> 00:52:40,809
to get me? I will expose you right now. I don't care. People know I'm the drug dealer. Everybody

286
00:52:40,809 --> 00:52:59,420
knows me in here. I'm the drug dealer with the red hat. All right. Looking for a girl.

287
00:53:00,139 --> 00:53:08,099
They keep communicating that there's a girl assassin somewhere. Up top, maybe.

288
00:53:08,659 --> 00:53:20,650
Is this guy still following me? He is. What if I never give this guy drugs? I just take him on

289
00:53:20,650 --> 00:53:33,989
an elaborate just follow mission where he just follows me around. I can't talk to him. Oh,

290
00:53:33,989 --> 00:53:50,090
you're getting upset. Omega Lol Skyrim partner. Oh wait, here's the merch store. Is there an assassin

291
00:53:50,090 --> 00:54:12,199
in here? Nobody here. I'm looking for the last person. Staff only. There's no one even back here.

292
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:24,889
This is the front. Did I even check out front? You know what I mean? I feel like I didn't spend

293
00:54:24,889 --> 00:54:31,940
very much time back here. Is somebody in here? Is somebody out here in the line? I don't know

294
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:45,000
where this final person is. They're just waiting in the line. I don't know. What?

295
00:54:49,159 --> 00:55:02,679
What? What is he talking about? He's doing like a football juke to spin around him.

296
00:55:02,679 --> 00:55:06,679
Okay all right all right I'm gonna leave. Okay you whip around.

297
00:55:08,599 --> 00:55:13,510
Where's the other one? Where's the last one? Where's the last guy?

298
00:55:14,659 --> 00:55:20,260
Where's the last one? Where's the last one? Davenport. I killed Davenport.

299
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:29,219
Where's the last one? No no no no no no no no I don't hurt anybody.

300
00:55:29,219 --> 00:55:34,260
No no no I don't want to hurt anybody. I don't want to hurt anybody.

301
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:51,269
I don't want to hurt anybody

302
00:56:00,010 --> 00:56:08,650
With the last guy ways alive

303
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:18,539
The guy live with the guy that I shot in the head is live. No, he's not

304
00:56:18,539 --> 00:56:45,400
I can't save it until I'm not a country anymore. Oh fuck. I gotta go down. I save it

305
00:57:14,170 --> 00:57:22,550
Shit I didn't I gotta get his body

306
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:26,579
Give me the body. Who the fuck are you? Who's looking at me? Who are you? What are you doing?

307
00:57:27,139 --> 00:57:55,849
That's unconscious. What is it? Does he know the controls? Yeah, but you hold holding G is awkward

308
00:57:55,889 --> 00:58:09,800
It's like a weird button to have it be like E. There's a real nasty troublemaker out there

309
00:58:10,159 --> 00:58:14,230
You don't you say that for like somebody dropped like firecrackers like outside

310
00:58:14,829 --> 00:58:22,369
Not like someone's killing people with an axe. Thank God. I found security. There's a real like rascal troublemaker out there

311
00:58:22,369 --> 00:58:24,369
He's dropping the firecrackers

312
00:58:53,719 --> 00:59:07,030
You gotta be fucking dead

313
00:59:07,909 --> 00:59:14,170
No

314
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:37,889
God damn it. It's give me out of this mission. I don't want to do this one anymore

315
00:59:37,889 --> 01:00:15,800
I hate this place fucking game is lagging. Oh my god, of course this cameras it hits me

316
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:43,380
Really that camera is gonna do this audible frustration intensifies. It doesn't even feel like a hitman mission. Where's the exit?

317
01:00:49,909 --> 01:01:19,210
No, the exits like up here. Okay, where does he go? They have to go up another floor

318
01:01:19,769 --> 01:01:25,730
Let me see. Let me look at the map. Club security. Let's go level zero

319
01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:40,000
Let's see. He just that guy just walks around down here. He just walks around in a circle

320
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,360
I probably had to have done something to him down there

321
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:47,199
The exits up here you leave through this way. I just gotta run but how am I gonna kill this guy?

322
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:52,239
How do I kill this guy down here without causing a huge scene?

323
01:01:53,199 --> 01:02:00,320
Poison or something. He's not that I that's not the drug guy. I don't know. He goes into that side room

324
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:05,769
I think I'm gonna shoot him in the head and then run. I need to took out of the next mission

325
01:02:05,769 --> 01:02:21,190
I just to get out of here and run by with a bicycle. That's plan

326
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:32,550
Yeah, I know this is dogshit gameplay. This is like horrible gameplay Andy

327
01:02:32,550 --> 01:02:42,980
I know but I want to see that I want to get it. I don't like this level. I'm just gonna go for

328
01:02:43,519 --> 01:02:55,769
Kill him already. I'm just gonna wait till he gets into view so I can do it and I better not shoot this lady in

329
01:02:55,769 --> 01:03:13,670
The head I better not get up don't no one stand behind me. He's actually coming upstairs. It's perfect

330
01:03:13,670 --> 01:03:21,769
Alright, here we go. Line it up. Get a good line of sight here

331
01:03:22,409 --> 01:03:34,579
Right there right there. Here we go. Three two one action. Don't get out. Get it my way

332
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:41,849
They don't know it's me, right? They don't know it's me. They've no idea

333
01:03:48,679 --> 01:03:58,420
What I just went the wrong way. I got shot himself. Wait, what happened? This wasn't the right way

334
01:03:58,619 --> 01:04:24,710
Isn't this that you've done you hold on? Let me see with this. Where does this go? This goes up here and then

335
01:04:25,269 --> 01:04:33,739
Bang a left right out this way. How do I get out of here? What's the actual like exit?

336
01:04:41,159 --> 01:04:50,989
It was the other way. So like down here. Wait, so come here. I go here

337
01:04:51,590 --> 01:04:56,900
That's not good. You have to go up the exit. Don't you?

338
01:04:57,260 --> 01:05:09,949
Up the stairs to the right this way and then you're trapped here. No, not off this. It's the same staircase

339
01:05:10,570 --> 01:05:18,000
And then to the right but then wait the straight through here. Let me see

340
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:34,070
It was just the actual I've never been out here yet. What the hell is this place? What the fuck? What is this?

341
01:05:34,590 --> 01:06:00,449
Why is it like nobody out here? What's the point of this whole area? Just follow the exit sign. Hold on. This is the exit

342
01:06:00,489 --> 01:06:19,949
That's the exit, right? I'm going for it. There's more areas with more agents. I hope you enjoy it

343
01:06:19,949 --> 01:06:27,610
I hope this is your favorite level. I hope you love this place. I will never open this level ever again

344
01:06:27,929 --> 01:06:44,139
I'm not gonna open this level for any reason you could tell me that love it

345
01:06:44,139 --> 01:06:48,260
It was like five BTC hidden on this level and I wouldn't care. I'd be like, I don't care

346
01:06:48,260 --> 01:06:59,599
I don't know. I don't want even going there. I'm not going there. I'm following that follow the goddamn exit signs

347
01:07:01,989 --> 01:07:14,400
There was two green exit signs

348
01:07:23,719 --> 01:07:45,929
Okay, fine. Where am I?

349
01:07:46,010 --> 01:07:51,340
It's the bright lights and the fucking concrete and the thousand people get me out of here

350
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:57,980
Get me out of the streamer room. I don't want to be in this live streamers room. Okay, get me out of this place, too

351
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:09,460
Excuse me. Excuse me. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. It was very nice. That was very fun to see you. Goodbye exit

352
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:17,000
I'm out. Where's the exit?

353
01:08:17,079 --> 01:08:33,000
What I let me locate the exit and I didn't leave who the fuck are these people I'm going to the fucking sewer

354
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:44,609
Get out get out go in the sewer. What are you doing? Go in the sewer

355
01:08:45,310 --> 01:08:57,520
Go in the sewer. Where's the my fucking god? Why can I not go in here put the gun away get me?

356
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:34,100
Hiding behind this guy. Oh

357
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:39,750
Yes, when will it end why can't I leave

358
01:09:40,550 --> 01:09:45,439
Why can't I go down sewer? What the fuck is this buggy shithawk?

359
01:09:46,359 --> 01:09:49,359
Shithawk, what's a shithawk?

360
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,119
shithawk

361
01:09:59,119 --> 01:10:02,960
That's some kind of large bird

362
01:10:17,350 --> 01:10:19,350
God why can't I fucking leave?

363
01:10:19,710 --> 01:10:37,100
Why are they doing this to me? They're doing it to me on purpose. They're doing to me. This is on purpose. Move

364
01:10:48,329 --> 01:11:06,590
Please get away from me exit combat. Are you kidding me? Just reload it. Reload it. Reload it. Reload it. Reload it.

365
01:11:06,590 --> 01:11:15,989
Is that what was happening? I couldn't go in. Use the map. The map in Hitman is one of the most confusing things in the whole game

366
01:11:16,149 --> 01:11:28,100
No, no, what do you mean blind? I can't even go up there. It was an arrow

367
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:31,760
I know but I was trying to sneak away. It's just taking me the same way

368
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:35,539
Why can't I just go in the in the in the manhole cover?

369
01:11:36,319 --> 01:11:39,640
Jesus you're a stormtrooper

370
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:56,880
Because you were in combat. I've no I wasn't I wasn't in combat when I opened the manhole

371
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:01,760
I I did like the whole G to exit and it didn't do anything

372
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:25,460
Go right into the store and then right again it bugged out but the silencer run I guys I didn't unlock the silencer because the game

373
01:12:25,659 --> 01:12:32,239
Doesn't stay connected to the internet for more than fucking two hours. You remember that shit. I don't have any unlockables

374
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:39,489
I've completed like two missions being kicked off line, so I have no progress

375
01:12:40,449 --> 01:13:03,850
Just stop killing them die. It's the starting gun. Is it? Oh, we're getting real anger

376
01:13:06,329 --> 01:13:09,090
No, we're not I just like I couldn't unlock any cool things

377
01:13:09,770 --> 01:13:15,640
All right, just fucking come on. Just get out of here. I'm gonna listen to the one guy

378
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:30,880
Let's see if they're right. I said go to the store take a right. Please don't let me down. Don't let me down one guy come on

379
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:12,000
I can't I can't just run. I'll die guys. I'll die. I will just die and I can't say

380
01:14:12,739 --> 01:14:15,109
I'll get shot like three times in the back and die

381
01:14:16,029 --> 01:14:24,880
Yeah, I will I'll die. I will die

382
01:14:25,399 --> 01:14:36,220
These guys are made out of like ceramic. Why I don't

383
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:40,890
Alright, I'm gonna settle down. I'm gonna relax

384
01:14:41,250 --> 01:14:49,890
Okay, if I could rank every hitman level across every single one of the video games. This is below ET

385
01:15:15,899 --> 01:15:24,739
All right, my favorite comment I've read was in all capitals this sucks and you suck at least we both equally suck

386
01:15:24,739 --> 01:15:47,060
It's not just we both equally suck. I'm like, thank god damn it man. Just fuck this place never coming back here again

387
01:15:47,060 --> 01:15:50,619
There's gonna be like a five achievements to get here. I'm never gonna see this opened up one way ever

388
01:15:51,140 --> 01:15:57,350
We started back here like taking a phone call. Remember there's a guy. I gotta try to call somebody

389
01:15:58,510 --> 01:16:22,949
The Joker how did I get this many achievements for this? This is so embarrassing

390
01:16:23,550 --> 01:16:26,529
This is so embarrassing

391
01:16:26,529 --> 01:16:32,329
That's the most amount of achievements for a level think I've gotten in any level even doing it right and doing it the way that you're

392
01:16:32,329 --> 01:16:49,619
Supposed to but what it isn't that's embarrassing, isn't it? Oh man. Finally, what a shithawk of a level

393
01:17:01,210 --> 01:17:07,430
Shit cock maybe that's what I was saying. I don't know. Oh cool

394
01:17:25,310 --> 01:17:29,770
He's and I'm right here and he's doing jumping Jackson he's looks huge he's really really good

395
01:17:34,260 --> 01:17:41,600
47 he didn't suffer did he he made it

396
01:17:42,420 --> 01:17:52,819
Nobody cares about the hitman story skip. I

397
01:17:55,079 --> 01:17:57,079
Mean, I don't but I'm still gonna watch it

398
01:17:57,079 --> 01:18:03,159
I didn't care about like the Sonic the Hedgehog the movies storyline, but I watched it and thought it was cool

399
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:17,720
You stormed the heavens took down the untouchables and yet here we are

400
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:26,270
Status quo it just goes to show you can't fight power miss Byrd would power never dies

401
01:18:26,470 --> 01:18:28,470
It only changes hands

402
01:18:29,350 --> 01:18:31,350
the best

403
01:18:33,829 --> 01:18:35,829
Pretty nice picture of a

404
01:18:37,109 --> 01:18:44,000
It's the thing that gets you to the thing as the next constant you can be the

405
01:18:47,550 --> 01:18:49,550
Transform the system from the inside

406
01:18:50,829 --> 01:18:54,529
Be transformed the thing that gets you to the thing

407
01:18:55,789 --> 01:19:01,510
Power is the thing that gets you powerful. It gives the thing to different people to you to me. It's power

408
01:19:01,510 --> 01:19:10,350
It's a bit of an object that we can grasp and hold and bring it and bring it hard and bring the gas

409
01:19:10,869 --> 01:19:21,970
Power power power is power power is a curious thing. Are you fond of riddles?

410
01:19:21,970 --> 01:19:29,409
Why am I about to hear one three men stand in the barracks a priest a rich man and a clergyman

411
01:19:29,850 --> 01:19:33,130
Each is bidding the sellsword to kill the other man

412
01:19:33,729 --> 01:19:39,609
Who kills who well that depends on the sellsword does it he is if not gold or no favor with the crown

413
01:19:40,170 --> 01:19:45,529
It depends on the sellsword. I don't know. Well, I'll tell you a very small man can cast a large shadow

414
01:19:46,050 --> 01:19:55,930
No other way. It's a very small. Did I say it right?

415
01:19:55,930 --> 01:20:03,340
I said it wrong

416
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:06,340
Closer. I'm telling you the file John

417
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:15,000
Constant doesn't so much burn his bridges as blow them up Arthur Edwards, whoever he was don't exist anymore

418
01:20:15,699 --> 01:20:21,659
His personal data somehow deletes itself from any system that records him way beyond advanced

419
01:20:22,319 --> 01:20:26,689
The partner spared no expense to make sure that controller would be untraceable

420
01:20:27,250 --> 01:20:29,250
How untraceable I?

421
01:20:29,649 --> 01:20:38,560
Did what you asked but gray's gone and I'm no Diana. That's the first since I actually comprehended in about you gotta be kidding six minutes

422
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:46,670
I see they're hacking somewhere. I used every encryption known to men. Who are these guys best?

423
01:20:46,909 --> 01:20:52,319
It's only a matter of time before they get luck. We need to take them down

424
01:20:53,380 --> 01:21:00,399
You and which army I don't need one the agency stores its files mission reports client data

425
01:21:01,119 --> 01:21:05,250
If we leak it to the public you want to whistleblow the ICA

426
01:21:06,289 --> 01:21:09,649
It's the path of least resistance. Holy shit. They made a hitman movie

427
01:21:10,529 --> 01:21:14,689
Did anyone see it? I don't think anybody saw it

428
01:21:15,590 --> 01:21:28,789
And i'm out. So what are we breaking into data facility and chunking three of them run by a man, of course

429
01:21:29,430 --> 01:21:35,520
The ICA side in Chongqing houses the agency's data storage and analyst division

430
01:21:36,659 --> 01:21:39,140
Needless to say security is daunting

431
01:21:40,180 --> 01:21:44,979
The state of the art server vault is biometrically wired to the facilities to overseers

432
01:21:45,939 --> 01:21:47,460
imaging reuss

433
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:49,539
behavioral analysis pioneer

434
01:21:49,539 --> 01:21:50,819
and hush

435
01:21:50,819 --> 01:21:54,600
A data security guru with a taste for fringe transhuman experimentation

436
01:21:55,779 --> 01:22:01,060
Tell me about hush. It's a matrix a former cyber terrorist for the ministry of state security in kadan yang

437
01:22:01,619 --> 01:22:05,380
Who fled his country after one of the po regime's periodic purges?

438
01:22:06,260 --> 01:22:12,579
He made a career doing cyber security for dark web deplorables human traffickers organ harvesters

439
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:16,979
Scum like him with no code or conscience no code

440
01:22:17,699 --> 01:22:20,020
ICA sure can pick them

441
01:22:20,020 --> 01:22:21,380
No offense

442
01:22:21,380 --> 01:22:23,380
Can you disable security? Whoa?

443
01:22:23,779 --> 01:22:30,100
A dual authentication wait are they plugged in any handling of data must be directly authorized by hush and royce

444
01:22:30,819 --> 01:22:34,180
The proverbial human factor device to make the system impenetrable

445
01:22:35,140 --> 01:22:37,380
Luckily, I found a loophole

446
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:41,939
If both overseers should unexpectedly die within a short space of time

447
01:22:41,939 --> 01:22:48,020
Oh, no, the system reverts to a temporary failsafe protocol, which I can buy so they both have to die within like a minute

448
01:22:48,020 --> 01:22:50,899
Take them off the board and you'll have free access to the data core

449
01:22:51,699 --> 01:22:53,619
And i'll handle the rest

450
01:22:53,619 --> 01:22:56,119
And you're sure it'll work

451
01:22:56,199 --> 01:23:01,579
Look, I know hush. Oh just like the romeo and juliette encounter. We won't live long enough in carousel

452
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:04,199
Yes like that

453
01:23:04,199 --> 01:23:16,899
Wink wink both of us leave you to prepare. I'm so glad i'm getting just massive minus two

454
01:23:20,039 --> 01:23:22,319
All right, let's go

455
01:23:22,319 --> 01:23:25,520
That's on master

456
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:27,520
Excuse me. Oh, no, I thought it was selected. Okay

457
01:23:28,340 --> 01:23:29,220
Oh

458
01:23:29,220 --> 01:23:36,310
All right. Here we go

459
01:23:36,310 --> 01:23:38,039
neon city

460
01:23:38,039 --> 01:23:40,789
I'm ready mission stories

461
01:23:41,270 --> 01:24:06,000
Certainty principle impulse control all seeing I i'm looking forward to this one. Let's go. I'm not doing master. No chonking china

462
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:12,800
This city is big brother's wet dream with more than 2.5 million cameras covering 15 million people that seems

463
01:24:14,159 --> 01:24:16,159
That seems like they would get stuck everywhere

464
01:24:16,239 --> 01:24:22,239
It's pretty ironic four of those would just be in your pantry randomly during the day. That'd be horrible

465
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:31,810
You'll find hush conducting his fringe experiments in an abandoned apartment building while imaging royce the archivist

466
01:24:32,289 --> 01:24:35,250
Runs a day-to-day business of the ica data facility. Okay

467
01:24:36,369 --> 01:24:38,369
I just hope you know what you're doing 47

468
01:24:39,909 --> 01:24:45,439
All right sniper

469
01:24:45,439 --> 01:24:50,319
All right, eliminate hush eliminate emojin royce hack the data core

470
01:24:50,800 --> 01:25:00,920
What we got here, this is pretty level they're very very far away. They're very far away. Okay

471
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:11,619
Holy shit. This is so high up

472
01:25:11,699 --> 01:25:16,050
And look anybody that wants to tell me

473
01:25:16,050 --> 01:25:18,050
That says durama don't push her

474
01:25:20,659 --> 01:25:22,659
She's only here to be pushed

475
01:25:23,380 --> 01:25:25,569
You understand?

476
01:25:25,569 --> 01:25:27,409
It's the beginning of the level

477
01:25:27,409 --> 01:25:29,489
It's just one person right at a balcony

478
01:25:30,369 --> 01:25:36,529
They put this person here to try to just see who will push her off. It doesn't it's why there's no reason for this person

479
01:25:36,529 --> 01:25:50,949
To be here. Okay. Look at look. She's the only one

480
01:25:51,670 --> 01:25:59,189
All right, let's get I want to get some intel. It's a very pretty map. It is

481
01:25:59,829 --> 01:26:01,029
ooh

482
01:26:01,029 --> 01:26:17,029
Can I ride that? I think i'm gonna go this way go back and shove her now

483
01:26:17,670 --> 01:26:27,029
No, you can do it in your playthrough. I guess i'm just gonna just check out up here

484
01:26:28,630 --> 01:26:29,909
Oh, wait

485
01:26:29,909 --> 01:26:31,350
I can drop these

486
01:26:31,350 --> 01:26:38,960
But why would I want to do that? This guy care that i'm going into this like a house

487
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:54,390
Laundromat what's going on in here?

488
01:26:55,479 --> 01:26:58,579
Uh, wait, what is going on in here?

489
01:27:03,159 --> 01:27:05,560
It's like just buckets. So they do you go to a laundromat and like wash your

490
01:27:06,359 --> 01:27:08,119
Clothes and like just like a bucket

491
01:27:08,119 --> 01:27:13,060
Wait, i'm confused. Well, where are the wait a minute. Oh, they're just not here. Okay

492
01:27:16,789 --> 01:27:25,479
Any intel

493
01:27:35,829 --> 01:27:46,710
Oh, well, sorry

494
01:27:46,710 --> 01:27:52,210
Buy one buy one and let it come up

495
01:27:55,090 --> 01:27:56,609
Oh nothing came out

496
01:27:56,609 --> 01:28:01,399
You just kick it. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, we just boot that

497
01:28:09,090 --> 01:28:11,140
You didn't get one here

498
01:28:11,140 --> 01:28:12,659
Here I can help you

499
01:28:12,659 --> 01:28:14,659
Look, I know these things can be kind of finicky

500
01:28:15,439 --> 01:28:21,840
There yeah, I pressed on uh lemon lime soda and a root beer came out. That means yours was in the queue before mine

501
01:28:27,159 --> 01:28:28,930
um

502
01:28:28,930 --> 01:28:29,810
Okay

503
01:28:29,810 --> 01:28:34,930
What's in here?

504
01:28:34,930 --> 01:28:37,329
Sorry, I like looked at you for a second

505
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:43,199
Just throw it to her

506
01:28:43,199 --> 01:28:52,949
Oh, yeah, good call

507
01:28:52,949 --> 01:28:53,909
Okay

508
01:28:53,909 --> 01:29:00,800
Out of the laundromat. We're now

509
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:20,340
You up there opportunity 47 a guard patrols are clearly searching for something on the roof of the laundry

510
01:29:20,899 --> 01:29:28,760
What could they be looking for?

511
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:32,840
Why don't we find out?

512
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:42,800
Okay, is there a ladder I can climb up on is there a way to go up from here?

513
01:29:43,039 --> 01:29:52,920
What about this way interact with the keypad?

514
01:29:53,479 --> 01:30:15,239
I gotta get the code from this guy

515
01:30:15,239 --> 01:30:18,500
Watch the code to the door

516
01:30:18,579 --> 01:30:21,460
Say it on one of the uh, one of these things. No, that'd be funny if it did

517
01:30:25,170 --> 01:30:26,689
Ooh, what is that?

518
01:30:26,689 --> 01:30:30,840
Okay, this like poison over there. Hold on. I just want to get heaven. I want it to come out

519
01:30:37,670 --> 01:30:39,670
Wait, can I give me the iron?

520
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:47,989
Is there a way to go up from here? I gotta get on the roof

521
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:55,810
And wait

522
01:30:55,810 --> 01:30:58,449
Can I jump out when it's right there?

523
01:31:06,279 --> 01:31:14,399
It's written on one of the laundry machines

524
01:31:15,199 --> 01:31:16,819
Is it?

525
01:31:16,819 --> 01:31:25,729
Well, do I need to do that?

526
01:31:25,729 --> 01:31:39,000
I climbed the pipe. Let's go down here. See if I can wrap around. I don't want to push him yet

527
01:31:39,079 --> 01:31:42,420
No, I need to explore the area. What's going on in the noodle place?

528
01:32:03,399 --> 01:32:04,760
Noodle run. Okay

529
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:15,090
That wasn't data. How was that not data? I just don't want I don't want that to be very loud. Hold on

530
01:32:15,329 --> 01:32:21,279
Okay, that wasn't intel of any kind

531
01:32:23,239 --> 01:32:26,369
But up there

532
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:37,380
Okay, I see a pipe. I'm gonna let me get on top of the laundromat. Let me find a way up there down here

533
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:43,510
And then go up that way. He's drinking a heel

534
01:32:48,710 --> 01:33:04,289
Okay, get on top of the laundromat. What's this?

535
01:33:08,640 --> 01:33:12,560
No, I already went up this way. Is there how do I get on there? I do I think I have to jump out of that

536
01:33:13,119 --> 01:33:15,760
This just takes me around the back

537
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:18,199
It's a loop. Yeah

538
01:33:23,460 --> 01:33:28,500
Can I hang from here? How do I need maybe I can't can I get on this pipe? I don't think I can get on the pipe

539
01:33:36,199 --> 01:33:39,300
Can I jump from here? I don't know

540
01:33:40,180 --> 01:33:48,399
What's the map look like? No, I don't know because this is the laundromat here. There's a staircase

541
01:33:49,409 --> 01:33:51,489
Wait, I think I might do I need the password?

542
01:33:52,210 --> 01:33:55,670
I think I need the password

543
01:33:55,670 --> 01:34:07,140
Do I need to reload the whole map? Is that you guys not fucking around? I was gonna explore

544
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:20,560
You know, okay down i'm gonna down to this. How what's the time? How I have to kill him in a certain time frame

545
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:40,550
Is that legit?

546
01:34:40,710 --> 01:34:45,250
Stealing her past

547
01:34:46,050 --> 01:34:48,800
What does that mean though? What's that mean?

548
01:34:53,590 --> 01:35:18,079
Is it just me or have they upped the crazy lately? Where's the fucking intel? I want to do this one

549
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:32,470
It says I can make a lot of money to be in some experiment

550
01:35:33,029 --> 01:35:35,029
Oh put me in the experiment, please

551
01:35:35,430 --> 01:35:41,560
What the hell is happening?

552
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:44,079
What are you guys doing? Why is everyone freaking out?

553
01:35:46,390 --> 01:35:48,390
This is my chance

554
01:35:48,390 --> 01:35:52,079
Are we throwing it on sub only?

555
01:35:52,079 --> 01:35:56,930
Throw it on sub on throw it on sub only immediately. I just missed this

556
01:36:06,310 --> 01:36:09,989
All right disguise yourself as a homeless person, right? They were talking about like the okay

557
01:36:10,949 --> 01:36:15,300
This is I kind of I don't this like I don't like this

558
01:36:19,989 --> 01:36:22,630
Why do I have to take a homeless person's disguise?

559
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:26,199
Why can't I just say i'm homeless? I don't understand that

560
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:30,920
Why do I have to like take this guy out?

561
01:36:38,180 --> 01:36:40,340
Oh shit, the fucking channel points shit

562
01:36:42,550 --> 01:36:44,550
Turn it in emote only instead

563
01:36:46,470 --> 01:36:49,829
Or turn turn slow mode. I don't know what to do. I don't what do I don't know what to do

564
01:36:50,390 --> 01:36:52,390
There's tons of shit going on

565
01:36:52,710 --> 01:37:00,079
All right. Let me let me turn off channel points. Hold on. I wish everybody could just fucking behave themselves

566
01:37:01,189 --> 01:37:06,340
I don't want to have to do this, but I will i'm gonna have to turn off the chat channel points

567
01:37:20,479 --> 01:37:34,770
Sub only emote only mode. Holy fuck. That's like a extreme. Let me turn this off

568
01:37:35,489 --> 01:37:42,000
All right. I just typed into fucking google channel points. God damn it

That's intel. All right. Where's the fine entrance to the homeless shelter?

633
01:47:57,119 --> 01:48:08,000
There's an unusual number of chefs entering the restaurant kitchen in the middle of the night might be something worth investigating

634
01:48:10,039 --> 01:48:15,380
hmm

635
01:48:15,380 --> 01:48:17,380
They're gonna see if I climb on this though, won't they?

636
01:48:17,939 --> 01:48:22,979
Where's the laundromat up here?

637
01:48:24,819 --> 01:48:42,229
How do I find the homeless shelter? Excuse me, the numbers germa the numbers I could go just do that

638
01:48:49,970 --> 01:49:01,430
Unusual amount of chefs going in and out welcome to yuzong district. What is this place?

639
01:49:01,909 --> 01:49:11,640
Why does it have a passcode for what?

640
01:49:12,550 --> 01:49:15,439
zero one one eight

641
01:49:15,439 --> 01:49:25,039
Zero one one eight one of the restaurant chefs seems to have lost a note with an access code

642
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:28,960
What kind of a restaurant requires a code for the employees to get to work?

643
01:49:39,380 --> 01:49:57,600
So this is the is this restaurant? All right, so I have the code. Let's check it out. Let's see what's down there big doors

644
01:50:26,850 --> 01:50:28,850
Someone is here for a tour of the facility

645
01:50:29,010 --> 01:50:32,340
Might be a way to get in

646
01:50:43,600 --> 01:50:56,680
The p41

647
01:50:56,680 --> 01:51:02,050
the p41

648
01:51:03,140 --> 01:51:04,420
Back of the restaurant

649
01:51:04,420 --> 01:51:13,840
Mr angus pritchard the visiting ica board member forgot a form in his apartment across the street from the restaurant

650
01:51:14,079 --> 01:51:17,600
He needs to bring this to the facility guide before she can take him on the tour

651
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:22,229
He's going to go there. He's going to use the bathroom. Give him a swirly until he dies

652
01:51:22,630 --> 01:51:27,670
47 good luck. Did he leave already?

653
01:51:31,079 --> 01:51:34,119
I'll see to it. Oh, no, he's like distracted. I'm just gonna go over there now

654
01:51:34,760 --> 01:51:50,359
Here we go. Let's go get the p41

655
01:51:53,640 --> 01:51:58,550
Hard candies. I wish I had something juicy for you straight laced as they come

656
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:02,800
Everyone just gossips about everybody, huh?

657
01:52:19,409 --> 01:52:26,760
41 throw scissors to the guy's head

658
01:52:27,720 --> 01:52:41,460
You know how many times wait? Oh shit. This is the fucking door. Oh, this is his door

659
01:52:50,630 --> 01:52:52,949
I like needed that info to get in here

660
01:52:53,670 --> 01:52:56,470
Does he walk back over here? I need to I have to wait for him, right?

661
01:52:56,550 --> 01:53:01,590
I have to like smoke weed in his gta apartment before he comes over. Ooh, we got an answer machines and

662
01:53:02,840 --> 01:53:07,350
The 41 what's the answer machine say?

663
01:53:11,270 --> 01:53:17,569
I've just learned that will be delayed beyond the lifetime of the entry code you received for the facility

664
01:53:18,210 --> 01:53:20,210
For your convenience. We've set up the new

665
01:53:22,130 --> 01:53:25,250
To match the one for the apartment why would somebody be guessing that

666
01:53:28,949 --> 01:53:34,130
Some ladies like

667
01:53:34,529 --> 01:53:36,529
You forgot it

668
01:53:40,130 --> 01:53:42,130
This guy's talking from around the wall

669
01:53:53,350 --> 01:53:57,880
Yeah, that was not a message that person's in the room with me game volume

670
01:54:19,890 --> 01:54:24,689
That was perfect best part of the game right here. Oh, he got that right here

671
01:54:26,050 --> 01:54:31,079
I love this

672
01:54:31,079 --> 01:54:40,119
Can I just I suppose I got to talk for the rest of the game?

673
01:54:40,680 --> 01:54:42,680
All right. Wait, is this guy gonna come back to his apartment?

674
01:54:43,079 --> 01:54:46,899
Where's this dude?

675
01:54:46,899 --> 01:54:53,699
Will he come up here?

676
01:54:53,699 --> 01:54:55,699
Because I have to swirly him till he's dead

677
01:55:11,699 --> 01:55:19,359
I don't think he comes back. I was hoping I could just do it cleanly in here. All right. Well, let's go

678
01:55:20,079 --> 01:55:29,380
This guy's as the board member. Yeah, isn't that the guy that was just sitting at the restaurant?

679
01:55:31,010 --> 01:55:33,439
restaurant restaurant

680
01:55:35,359 --> 01:55:54,020
He's opened up a bunch of zorn tabs on his computer save it here. How do I just how am I supposed to do that?

681
01:55:57,220 --> 01:55:59,220
Um, does he end up going to the bathroom?

682
01:56:06,369 --> 01:56:19,750
Can I talk to him?

683
01:56:19,750 --> 01:56:32,640
Yep. Yeah

684
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:38,279
You can you go somewhere? I feel like something is supposed to happen with this interaction or something

685
01:56:38,600 --> 01:56:43,890
Why are they letting me just go in the kitchen?

686
01:56:44,050 --> 01:56:46,050
I just like walked behind and went to the kitchen

687
01:56:47,159 --> 01:56:50,479
Um, I guess i'm gonna i'm gonna poison this guy

688
01:57:02,899 --> 01:57:14,869
People talking

689
01:57:15,670 --> 01:57:17,670

690
01:57:18,560 --> 01:57:22,920

In the bathroom, he's gonna go to the bathroom

694
01:57:39,140 --> 01:57:45,590
Why is there rat poison in here? He's absolutely he's gonna go to the bathroom

695
01:57:47,569 --> 01:57:48,850
He is now

696

I mean honestly

697
01:58:02,439 --> 01:58:07,800
I guess maybe this wouldn't be a distraction because I would just think whoever was in here was just doing it right into the water piss

698
01:58:08,199 --> 01:58:45,600
No, here we go. Hold on. You don't hear this. There we go. Okay. Here we go. I tried to close the fucking door

Not hungry anymore. That's rude. I just think I just puked. Well, I poisoned it but still

733
02:04:07,170 --> 02:04:16,000
Hello need to inspect the facility now good. Hope you enjoyed the food. Nope. Did you bring the p41?

734
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,640
We left for you in the apartment. Yes

735
02:04:19,199 --> 02:04:29,960
Everything I need good. Okay, good. Let's continue the tour continue you may say

736
02:04:30,520 --> 02:04:32,520
We haven't even started the tour yet

737
02:04:33,159 --> 02:04:40,199
But we have without you even noticing it. Mr. Pritchard. It really is the best security there is

738
02:04:40,600 --> 02:04:42,600
You see the red

739
02:04:42,600 --> 02:04:46,529
All is a break, please. Why?

740
02:04:50,949 --> 02:04:53,510
Oh, that's what this is the secret takes you along

741
02:04:57,920 --> 02:04:59,920
Oh, I know the password

742
02:05:00,239 --> 02:05:02,239
It's zero one one eight

743
02:05:07,140 --> 02:05:09,140
See I know the password

744
02:05:11,140 --> 02:05:13,140
Yeah, I knew it was zero one one eight

745
02:05:13,380 --> 02:05:23,029
I'm pretty good at guessing

746
02:05:23,029 --> 02:05:27,430
No, this is why it's cement everywhere. I can't wait. Well, there's the big reveal

747
02:05:27,750 --> 02:05:32,500
Welcome, please report to security desk for visitor sign in we'll do

748
02:05:36,479 --> 02:05:43,840
Is really looking out for us and we're in the inside is a self-contained modular bill that can be disassembled

749
02:05:43,920 --> 02:05:50,319
I'm in in less than 12 hours. I'm in we are compromised no trace. We will ever hear I agree

750
02:05:51,039 --> 02:05:53,680
Leaving no trace behind is the only sensible

751
02:05:54,479 --> 02:06:02,319
The outside shell is a building marked for demolition. We put a hold on it with city planning a deliberate misplacement of the order

752
02:06:02,960 --> 02:06:05,600
But have people in place to rectify that

753
02:06:06,319 --> 02:06:09,279
At first shift city construction will move in

754
02:06:10,640 --> 02:06:18,239
Our policy around ica personnel is that they are a resource but also a risk on top of contractual repercussions

755
02:06:18,319 --> 02:06:22,319
If breaches occur, we perform detailed vetting on every

756
02:06:25,859 --> 02:06:27,859
Blood

757
02:06:27,859 --> 02:06:33,640
To vetting is a frisk. We have of course never had you can use your camera to hack that panel

758
02:06:36,420 --> 02:06:43,239
But we do consider that important i'll need to stop the setup of your visitor security clearance

759
02:06:43,300 --> 02:06:45,300
I'm just like taking pictures of everything

760
02:06:45,779 --> 02:06:49,460
Please give me your people you want mr. Richard so we can get things rolling

761
02:06:51,779 --> 02:06:57,989
Hello, sir, p41. How do I give it to you?

762
02:07:06,869 --> 02:07:08,869
Procedure

763
02:07:12,470 --> 02:07:17,909
Okay, you'll have to be frisked like everyone. Oh, I should probably put the gun down mr. Richard

764
02:07:21,430 --> 02:07:23,430
All right. Let me take a let me look around first

765
02:07:25,489 --> 02:07:27,489
There's no way you're getting through that door 47

766
02:07:27,890 --> 02:07:33,489
It only opens for people with an authentic security clearance. The signal is encrypted without a dongle. We can't hack it

767
02:07:33,489 --> 02:07:38,289
Uh, did you see did you see on your camera? Did you see I hope you did?

768
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:49,319
Of course, I got it

769
02:08:01,189 --> 02:08:04,550
Oh god damn this guy's on a fucking cell phone, of course, he's not gonna pay attention

770
02:08:06,159 --> 02:08:33,109
Wait, that means I can just walk by him

771
02:08:33,189 --> 02:08:36,470
Why her because I was trying to run out the door and she was in the way

772
02:08:50,079 --> 02:08:54,159
Tier one access dongle. I don't even need to be in here anymore. I got an access dongle

773
02:08:54,800 --> 02:09:00,289
Holy shit. I got an access dongle

774
02:09:00,289 --> 02:09:04,770
A dongle provides olivia with the encryption key needed to hack access tier one rfid panels

775
02:09:05,250 --> 02:09:09,640
Now I gotta hide my gun

776
02:09:09,640 --> 02:09:19,560
So I can I you what is it? I guess that blocks out the view

777
02:09:25,220 --> 02:09:27,220
Security protocol overruled

778
02:09:30,449 --> 02:09:35,250
Security protocol overruled I can just open up off the door. Wait, can I open up the door behind them?

779
02:09:36,930 --> 02:09:38,449
God, that would be funny

780
02:09:38,449 --> 02:09:40,689
No, don't first me yet. I'm not ready. I have a gun on me

781
02:09:52,819 --> 02:09:54,819
I'm just fucking with their house

782
02:09:55,300 --> 02:09:57,600
Server room

783
02:09:57,600 --> 02:10:00,000
What's in here? Whoa, what is this?

784
02:10:00,640 --> 02:10:05,510
uh

785
02:10:05,829 --> 02:10:07,829
Is a vent into this room

786
02:10:08,439 --> 02:10:10,439
Okay, hold on. Cool. This is cool. I like hacking stuff

787
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:18,770
This is way cooler than the the 15 watchdogs allegiance missions that I played

788
02:10:19,409 --> 02:10:21,569
Where was the same two missions back and forth?

789
02:10:22,050 --> 02:10:32,560
What's this package? I'll take it. I don't even know what it is. I'll take it though. All right, I gotta put a gun away

790
02:10:33,279 --> 02:10:38,689
All right, we're gonna conceal, uh the gun

791
02:10:39,250 --> 02:10:43,359
Do I have anything else illegal?

792
02:10:43,359 --> 02:10:46,310
No, what the fuck man?

793
02:10:46,310 --> 02:10:48,390
I have okay. I have a lot of illegal items

794
02:10:48,789 --> 02:11:00,640
What is it? How do you drop stuff? F G L

795
02:11:07,359 --> 02:11:11,520
Z

796
02:11:11,520 --> 02:11:13,520
All right. I have no more illegal items. Right?

797
02:11:14,079 --> 02:11:30,020
I kind of want to get frisked while I hold a meaty bone in my hand. Yeah. Sorry. I just got back from disneyland

798
02:11:31,300 --> 02:11:35,619
Have you had one of these have you had one of these yet? I'm gonna need to go through your pockets my friend

799
02:11:36,020 --> 02:11:39,800
Let me just pat you down here

800
02:11:40,199 --> 02:11:49,090
Proceed by the way, those things are gross

801
02:11:50,420 --> 02:11:55,380
Oh the gigantic turkey leg those things are disgusting. I hate them. Who wants to eat that? They're terrible

802
02:11:55,699 --> 02:11:59,699
They get cold and shit you you bite like two bites off of it and it's cold in five to ten minutes

803
02:11:59,699 --> 02:12:04,500
You're walking around like outside. It's really like stringy meat. It's just like a meme

804
02:12:04,579 --> 02:12:18,500
I don't know. They're not even they're not good. Don't order those go get the mickey mouse ears chocolate bar. Can I close this window?

805
02:12:18,979 --> 02:12:26,340
Good you're here. I am here

806
02:12:28,260 --> 02:12:31,539
It will take a little while since you're covered by the zero protocol

807
02:12:32,180 --> 02:12:33,939
all your data will

808
02:12:33,939 --> 02:12:41,600
Be encrypted and inaccessible without your authorization access only facility ai will use it for id analysis

809
02:12:42,159 --> 02:12:47,199
Fully anonymized, of course, but we can do a few more steps on the tour while it's validating

810
02:12:48,479 --> 02:12:51,039
Id analysis what the hell does that mean?

811
02:12:52,149 --> 02:12:54,149
Give me a minute. I'll try to find out

812
02:12:54,550 --> 02:13:07,220
Nothing in here take something something to take chloroform and

813
02:13:07,939 --> 02:13:15,750
Tiered an access dongle

814
02:13:22,199 --> 02:13:30,199
Caught

815
02:13:30,199 --> 02:13:32,520
I'm just so annoying. This is probably you know

816
02:13:32,520 --> 02:13:38,199
This is probably what it was like to like be a hotel concierge and deal with the rock bands that came in

817
02:13:38,760 --> 02:13:40,359
Back in like the 80s

818
02:13:40,359 --> 02:13:45,079
We perform a type of obnoxious shit. They probably had to deal with to guarantee that no

819
02:13:50,039 --> 02:13:57,079
Drug use physical health issues external pressure or moral hesitancy the scan only takes a few seconds

820
02:13:57,479 --> 02:13:59,479
Let's step inside

821
02:14:00,199 --> 02:14:11,840
Until the iSafe facility has top-level security because of the highly stressful nature of the job employees are put through mandatory checkups on a regular basis

822
02:14:12,539 --> 02:14:18,159
Additionally, they are being monitored for elevated stress levels and other risk factors while in the workplace

823
02:14:18,479 --> 02:14:34,479
Will they scan my barcode? We can't proceed beyond this room until your security clearance is finalized

824
02:14:35,039 --> 02:14:39,520
So why don't you have a little look around while we wait? Mr. Richard? It should be here

825
02:14:40,479 --> 02:14:42,369
Shortly

826
02:14:42,369 --> 02:14:43,569
Shit

827
02:14:43,569 --> 02:14:47,409
We need to intercept that 47 or the facility ai will blow your cover

828
02:14:48,050 --> 02:14:52,930
Blow me up to one of those computers and do it fast computer. You've got 60 seconds before all hell breaks loose

829
02:14:52,930 --> 02:14:56,449
I have 60 seconds to get into a computer. What do we 60 hack this one?

830
02:14:57,489 --> 02:14:59,489
Wait, don't look at me

831
02:15:00,239 --> 02:15:09,079
security protocol

832
02:15:09,560 --> 02:15:17,960
Good i'm in i'm in and and you're safe

833
02:15:19,359 --> 02:15:20,880
That was a close one

834
02:15:20,880 --> 02:15:24,000
You didn't see shit

835
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:29,829
What's on your desk?

836
02:15:29,829 --> 02:15:32,229
You are way too close to me and you're really freaking me out

837
02:15:35,319 --> 02:15:38,039
Your clearance just came through let's continue

838
02:15:39,649 --> 02:15:41,649
How many of these dongles do I have?

839
02:15:47,539 --> 02:15:49,539
All right, let's see what it did

840
02:15:50,340 --> 02:15:53,859
Come on this way. Uh, your floor is two floors up on the elevator

841
02:15:55,060 --> 02:16:00,239
Maybe just go take a look inside what we just did over there with the printer. What did you do?

842
02:16:00,560 --> 02:16:02,880
I signed my ass and I scanned my ass on it

843
02:16:04,529 --> 02:16:17,569
Ha ha ha great very serious about security

844
02:16:18,130 --> 02:16:25,890
What we protect is after all core to all ica operation we and we alone store all legal work

845
02:16:30,210 --> 02:16:34,450
I just made her mouth closed do like the closed jaw teeth it like

846
02:16:35,889 --> 02:16:40,209
It made like a loud and she bit her teeth together that sucks when that happens

847
02:16:40,290 --> 02:16:44,129
Target profiles and of course offer real-time contract support

848
02:16:44,450 --> 02:16:51,889
If your chin gets closed too hard like you get bumped and it's like you bite like that takes constant vigilance to keep safe

849
02:16:52,610 --> 02:16:59,969
We have a team of engineers solely dedicated to that task and on top of that we have a dual human authentication process set up

850
02:17:00,450 --> 02:17:01,329
all

851
02:17:01,329 --> 02:17:07,219
Access and alterations to the source are authentic

852
02:17:07,620 --> 02:17:10,569
Oh

853
02:17:18,409 --> 02:17:22,889
I'm sorry. It's like if you get too close to the ropes in the wrestling ring, i'm gonna push you over

854
02:17:24,149 --> 02:17:26,870
I saw that coming. She was getting really close

855
02:17:34,180 --> 02:17:36,180
Wait, that was the target that walked out

856
02:17:40,250 --> 02:17:43,190
Oh my god, it is

857
02:17:47,930 --> 02:17:51,129
Imogen royce i've been looking forward to meeting you likewise

858
02:18:06,219 --> 02:18:08,319
Wait, hold on. Did that just say attack?

859
02:18:24,780 --> 02:18:27,459
I'm gonna get you

860
02:18:27,700 --> 02:18:29,940
Wait a second. Hold on

861
02:18:30,100 --> 02:18:33,819
Hold on just a second

862
02:18:33,899 --> 02:18:36,520
If I can I pull her off?

863
02:18:41,989 --> 02:18:43,989
I hope I can

864
02:18:50,420 --> 02:18:53,540
Nice to meet you. Yes, it is. It's very it's wonderful

865
02:19:19,399 --> 02:19:29,399
What I could have pushed him out the grade

866
02:19:30,120 --> 02:19:40,040
Try to put the gun down

867
02:19:40,120 --> 02:19:42,200
All right. All right. All right, let's go. Let's go. Let's go

868
02:19:44,889 --> 02:19:46,889
Can you imagine seeing that?

869
02:19:47,540 --> 02:19:51,780
The person you're giving the tour to oh, yes, it's very nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. Yeah

870
02:19:52,899 --> 02:19:57,459
Over the edge, although that guy's fucking weird. I don't know why excuse me. Um, mr. Mr. Pritchett

871
02:19:57,459 --> 02:20:10,809
Do you know can you come back over just grabs pulls her over what's I don't even know his name

872
02:20:22,540 --> 02:20:25,819
I want to remember this moment the rest of my fucking life

873
02:20:28,059 --> 02:20:30,059
Looking forward to meeting you likewise

874
02:20:30,860 --> 02:20:34,729
Let's go

875
02:20:34,729 --> 02:20:36,809
So show me what's going on in this facility

876
02:20:40,469 --> 02:20:42,950
God damn it. Don't get close. Don't get that close to the edge. I'm telling you

877
02:20:43,030 --> 02:20:46,950
I'm like a fucking trapdoor spider if you get too close, you're gonna go i'm gonna grab you

878
02:20:47,750 --> 02:20:54,950
This is the blood and emp shielded call room the nervous system of the ica where we store the past and facilitate the present

879
02:20:56,090 --> 02:21:02,729
In general only a handful of people can access this room hush and myself plus bodyguards and a chosen few of the engineers

880
02:21:03,290 --> 02:21:09,370
I'm the most likely person to meet in here because I perform a regular physical check-in on the core console as you plug in

881
02:21:15,899 --> 02:21:23,100
We have a strict routine of daily core maintenance part of that procedure is a flash process evaporating all biological matter in the room

882
02:21:24,059 --> 02:21:26,420
Yeah, do it with that maybe we could

883
02:21:27,620 --> 02:21:33,059
It's her job to initiate the maintenance. Don't worry. We're safe. I read the safety mechanism is engaged

884
02:21:33,459 --> 02:21:38,819
Even if reed presses the button the procedure will not happen until we leave the call room the doors to the call room

885
02:21:38,819 --> 02:21:40,819
Are all equipped with

886
02:21:41,780 --> 02:21:43,780
What screw this tour?

887
02:21:44,100 --> 02:21:47,059
I know why you're really here. It's a chase. I see

888
02:21:48,340 --> 02:21:50,100
Knowledge is power

889
02:21:50,100 --> 02:21:57,059
More importantly knowledge stand the way turn around. Don't look at me spin around you kill him. Don't kill him

890
02:21:58,659 --> 02:22:00,659
Power is power

891
02:22:00,659 --> 02:22:04,020
Has not been reported it has no doubt brought you here

892
02:22:04,739 --> 02:22:10,100
You do have authority to shut down unwanted efforts, but I just did that like an hour ago

893
02:22:10,180 --> 02:22:12,180
But there was not an opportunity to do it

894
02:22:12,579 --> 02:22:18,340
You have sway with the board and as I see it your opinion is now power is the thing that gets you the thing

895
02:22:20,500 --> 02:22:22,579
So here we go imagine this

896
02:22:23,459 --> 02:22:30,020
Having a time schedule on a target with minute details on location doesn't matter who has the power someone will always have power

897
02:22:30,899 --> 02:22:32,819
power is

898
02:22:32,819 --> 02:22:36,979
Attainable and one of us will have it will have that transform a contract

899
02:22:37,299 --> 02:22:39,299
powerful

900
02:22:39,620 --> 02:22:41,620
No mess no fuss

901
02:22:41,620 --> 02:22:43,620
Low cost just how I like it

902
02:22:44,200 --> 02:22:52,360
I've been working on a prediction algorithm based on a combination of big data analysis and micro targeted surveillance of defining target markers

903
02:22:52,360 --> 02:22:53,959
I have to pee so bad

904
02:22:53,959 --> 02:22:56,040
are astounding

905
02:22:56,120 --> 02:23:03,719
All this state of the art is nothing but heavy old-fashioned machinery compared to what I offer analysts preparing detailed files

906
02:23:03,799 --> 02:23:10,840
Dedicating days weeks to prepare our contracts gone handlers and analysts supporting our operatives during missions

907
02:23:11,239 --> 02:23:16,200
Gone teams for cleanup and media manipulation in the rare case something else does happen

908
02:23:16,920 --> 02:23:20,920
All of it gone. I asked you to imagine that scenario

909
02:23:21,319 --> 02:23:24,840
But what good is imagination when you can see it with your own eyes?

910
02:23:25,479 --> 02:23:28,920
I've set up a little demonstration for you. This is where they kill me

911
02:23:29,639 --> 02:23:33,000
Three employees unaware that I can accurately predict their behavior

912
02:23:33,639 --> 02:23:38,120
Accurately predict my behavior in an already clearly defined reaction on the top left

913
02:23:38,200 --> 02:23:43,159
We have sharon reed who you saw downstairs. She's a dutiful and trusted employee

914
02:23:43,879 --> 02:23:51,799
If she is to be fired my algorithm predicts with a certainty of 97.8 percent that she will finish up her most important tasks

915
02:23:51,879 --> 02:23:58,360
Before she leaves the building interesting specifically she will press the maintenance button within 11 seconds

916
02:23:58,440 --> 02:24:02,760
Will she the guard in the lower left is as tough as nails when on duty

917
02:24:03,239 --> 02:24:05,559
But in private he's a real mummy's boy

918
02:24:06,200 --> 02:24:13,000
If fired he will immediately call his mother and at her advice seek out who he considers his best friend for support

919
02:24:13,079 --> 02:24:15,799
Why is she giving me mission intel objectives?

920
02:24:16,760 --> 02:24:25,850
Explains why he's always next to me at lunch at the top right you see alicia reynolds right and very passionate about her job

921
02:24:26,409 --> 02:24:29,930
However, also very possessive about her contribution

922
02:24:30,010 --> 02:24:34,969
Okay, my prediction is that she will try to disable the work she has done for the ica

923
02:24:35,610 --> 02:24:37,610
If she's not allowed to enjoy her results

924
02:24:37,850 --> 02:24:44,010
No one is specifically that means she will try to enter the call room and disable the safety mechanism

925
02:24:44,090 --> 02:24:47,530
I'll leave you to consider your choice of who you want me to use for the demonstration

926
02:24:47,690 --> 02:24:52,329
Just let the guard outside the door know when you're ready and i'll be right back. I will have a closer look

927
02:24:53,129 --> 02:24:56,489
Maybe your project could play a part in the future of the ica

928
02:24:56,729 --> 02:25:01,129
Just let the guard outside the door know when you're ready and i'll be right back only two of us in here

929
02:25:01,129 --> 02:25:04,969
If you decide to leave the room a guard will escort you around safety protocol

930
02:25:05,610 --> 02:25:09,690
So there's only two of you. She really takes the term god complex to a whole new level

931
02:25:10,649 --> 02:25:16,870
Sitting in there pulling the strings like that. Oh, I think you should take her setup and give it a spin 47 sure

932
02:25:17,430 --> 02:25:18,709
I see

933
02:25:18,709 --> 02:25:24,540
Potential if you time it right

934
02:25:25,110 --> 02:25:27,110
Use terminal who are you gonna fire?

935
02:25:28,139 --> 02:25:29,579
erin reid

936
02:25:29,579 --> 02:25:33,049
disabled

937
02:25:33,049 --> 02:25:34,409
jeremy bolt

938
02:25:34,409 --> 02:25:36,409
or alicia reynolds

939
02:25:36,409 --> 02:25:38,329
disabled safety mechanism

940
02:25:38,329 --> 02:25:40,569
performs core maintenance by disabled safety

941
02:25:48,219 --> 02:26:06,680
Uh, okay, that was weird. All right. I'm gonna fire alicia reynolds. We're gonna disable

942
02:26:06,760 --> 02:26:11,659
The security system alicia reynolds

943
02:26:12,139 --> 02:26:16,950

948
02:26:44,379 --> 02:26:46,219

Okay, um

Yeah, so I I disabled the safety mechanisms and then I go do something

953
02:27:13,719 --> 02:27:20,100
Do I have to do these in a row? I gotta pee. Let me go pee

954

Engineer so why hold on right and very passionate if fired

960
02:32:11,260 --> 02:32:15,340
There's a 98 that she will try to disable the safety mechanism in the core room

961
02:32:16,229 --> 02:32:22,620
Okay, if fired he will leave his post at the core room door to call his mother

962
02:32:23,180 --> 02:32:28,680
Okay, if fired she will finish her most critical task before leaving the facility

963
02:32:28,760 --> 02:32:31,959
She will press the core maintenance button within 11 seconds

964
02:32:33,850 --> 02:32:42,299
Okay, so we need to so core maintenance so we have to go

982
02:34:15,290 --> 02:34:19,180
It still might happen

983
02:34:19,989 --> 02:34:21,270
Okay

1058
02:41:49,590 --> 02:41:54,389
Act event, okay

1059
02:41:56,329 --> 02:41:59,420
This is tier two, right?

1060
02:41:59,420 --> 02:42:01,420
Oh shit. Okay, I can go out there

1061
02:42:01,739 --> 02:42:09,110
Move it this way access granted

1062
02:42:09,989 --> 02:42:11,989
Shit, I don't know. Where should I go?

1063
02:42:12,149 --> 02:42:16,010
What should I do?

1064
02:42:16,010 --> 02:42:18,280
the dongle

1065
02:42:18,280 --> 02:42:21,799
Knew vincent's girlfriend was breaking up with him before he did

1066
02:42:22,520 --> 02:42:33,979
Save the game. I got you. She's spying on us all of us. Well, we're in it now there is to know

1067
02:42:34,700 --> 02:42:36,860
She knows still doesn't feel right

1068
02:42:38,120 --> 02:42:46,379
Okay, I think i'm gonna go out one of the vents

1069
02:42:51,530 --> 02:42:53,530
I'm going out this vent over here this one

1070
02:42:53,930 --> 02:42:58,870
Why not? I mean, this is a little strange that i'm doing this, right?

1071
02:42:59,510 --> 02:43:07,159
But I I want to go up. This is super sus what you're doing

1072
02:43:07,979 --> 02:43:09,979
I'll let you have it for a minute, but i'm just

1073
02:43:11,899 --> 02:43:13,899
That came on like I got hit by a

1074
02:43:14,459 --> 02:43:15,860
Truck

1075
02:43:15,860 --> 02:43:17,139
I couldn't stop that

1076
02:43:17,139 --> 02:43:21,139
That was sincerely one of the most intense feelings. I I couldn't stop I couldn't move

1077
02:43:21,780 --> 02:43:32,069
That just came out of nowhere. I have no idea why that happened. Nice ron

1078
02:43:32,549 --> 02:43:37,559
Access granted nice, right

1079
02:43:38,780 --> 02:43:42,059
Wait, didn't I say I was never gonna say that ever again in the rest of my life

1080
02:43:54,069 --> 02:43:57,670
All right, so should I be maybe security office? This is tier two security. Okay

1081
02:44:07,989 --> 02:44:09,989
Like an armory

1082
02:44:14,629 --> 02:44:16,309
Oh my god

1083
02:44:16,309 --> 02:44:17,989
Disable that camera

1084
02:44:17,989 --> 02:44:24,729
This is a suitcase over here. Don't ignore chat

1085
02:44:25,290 --> 02:44:27,860
You said you would add debt if you did that again. I did

1086
02:44:36,700 --> 02:44:44,250
What's in the briefcase? What's in the briefcase?

1087
02:44:49,239 --> 02:44:53,500
Tier three

1088
02:44:53,500 --> 02:44:55,100
Can I open the briefcase?

1089
02:44:55,100 --> 02:45:03,780
I just get to be a briefcase

1090
02:45:03,780 --> 02:45:07,579
Man, I want to get in there

1091
02:45:07,579 --> 02:45:09,879
tier three sub

1092
02:45:12,219 --> 02:45:14,260
Put a gun in there

1093
02:45:14,260 --> 02:45:16,739
Oh, I could put a gun in here. You're right, but I need to get over there

1094
02:45:16,899 --> 02:45:21,860
How do I get this camera to leave me alone? I mean, does it really matter? Does it matter?

1095
02:45:24,459 --> 02:45:25,500
Not really

1096
02:45:25,500 --> 02:45:52,069
We're doing grenade

1097
02:45:52,069 --> 02:45:53,670
Oh my eyes

1098
02:45:53,670 --> 02:45:57,959
I messed with a shotgun twice

1099
02:45:58,440 --> 02:46:05,719
Did you see that like kill him kill this motherfucker

1100
02:46:18,760 --> 02:46:20,760
2.5 billion. What?

1101
02:46:21,319 --> 02:46:24,120
No, that's bullshit. That was probably just that particular stream

1102
02:46:24,920 --> 02:46:53,270
That was definitely for that stream. I had it. I fucking got too greedy

1103
02:46:58,969 --> 02:47:34,500
I got too greedy had to try. I need the do I need the briefcase? All right. I got the shotgun in the briefcase

1104
02:47:35,370 --> 02:47:47,209
I'm good. Neck is tense

1105
02:47:47,450 --> 02:47:56,790
Too many conversations happening at the same time

1106
02:48:05,399 --> 02:48:13,399
All right, I need to go I got a tier three dongle now I can go up to tier three if that guy had brick massage

1107
02:48:17,590 --> 02:48:23,430
Yeah, what is this shit brick massage?

1108
02:48:26,809 --> 02:48:28,489
I thought that was a door

1109
02:48:28,489 --> 02:48:33,750
That looks that's a door. That's not a closet

1110
02:48:36,709 --> 02:48:39,510
All right to go up the stairs all the way up to tier three

1111
02:48:39,989 --> 02:49:09,059
Does that mean tier three like three deep or three up? That's three deep

1112
02:49:11,219 --> 02:49:21,610
Is it use the map? That's three deep or is it?

1113
02:49:30,229 --> 02:49:37,540
With the emergency exit open if I hack it I get in one guide. Is that real? Oh

1114
02:49:43,719 --> 02:49:49,100
Plus three. Okay. I thought that that guy was a bad guy because he was red

1115
02:49:49,180 --> 02:49:57,750
I thought I was doing this I need to go number three

1116
02:50:00,790 --> 02:50:19,860
Up we're on almost to three. Where the hell did I how did I get over here? Oh shit. Okay, cool

1118
02:50:30,420 --> 02:50:32,819
Is he in actually actually inside the facility?

1119
02:50:34,569 --> 02:50:36,569
He has to be right. This is like an exit

1120
02:50:40,440 --> 02:50:44,059
Am I losing my mind or what?

1121
02:50:44,059 --> 02:50:48,459
Holy shit. Oh my god. Oh my goodness. That's a lot of cameras

1122
02:51:03,899 --> 02:51:24,180
There's no one up here. I can shoot these

1123
02:51:24,180 --> 02:51:26,819
My god, that's gamer moment of the fucking century right there

1124
02:51:27,620 --> 02:52:00,649
Now I need to kill you

1125
02:52:00,649 --> 02:52:09,219

1126
02:52:13,290 --> 02:52:32,790
Why did that explode? Oh, it's a stupid drone

1142
02:55:53,219 --> 02:56:01,930
I need to go that way. Oh, hold on

1143
02:56:03,639 --> 02:56:05,399

02:59:12,809 --> 02:59:19,399
Can I not climb this?

1160
02:59:19,399 --> 02:59:40,149
Poison the ventilation system. He missed it twice. I did what do you mean? Is he coming out here?

1161
02:59:42,379 --> 02:59:48,649
I guess I do have gas I could do this and that goes into the room that he's in right now

03:02:22,489 --> 03:02:38,579
Get rid of your gun get rid of gun get rid of gun. It's not illegal. It fused pro bar

1171
03:02:38,579 --> 03:02:42,250
I'm definitely gonna need that

1172
03:02:42,250 --> 03:03:09,420
It's a gun. What is it? I'm a security. I'm a security guard. Do I have to pretend to be a test subject?

1173
03:03:09,739 --> 03:03:16,389
Okay, let's let's let's do the test subject one

1174
03:03:31,020 --> 03:03:33,829
Because it doesn't I don't want to do it

1175
03:03:34,469 --> 03:03:56,520
No package for you

1176
03:03:56,520 --> 03:04:08,360
Bye. Okay. Now I why would they give me the opportunity to do that now? I have to get rid of the gun

1177
03:04:08,600 --> 03:04:18,889
Here we go. He's coming up. Oh, they're coming to get me. Did I save it?

1178
03:04:37,750 --> 03:04:49,540
Are they gonna come get me? I'm ready for my treatment. That's him. That's it. He's in this chair bastard

1179
03:04:51,959 --> 03:04:55,159
He looks a lot older

1180
03:05:29,059 --> 03:05:47,399
Tomato in his face identify memory marker 90. I mean, I can't keep getting away with it, right?

1181
03:05:55,350 --> 03:05:57,350
Why it wants me to throw in his head

1182
03:06:12,649 --> 03:06:15,700
You can't go around people's heads like that

1183
03:06:16,739 --> 03:06:21,750
I understand

1184
03:06:21,750 --> 03:06:24,950
Does that jog the memory does that jog your memory?

1185
03:06:32,920 --> 03:06:44,360
I mean, I guess I could could I just go and zap him. Okay, I just I could just overload his brain with

1186
03:06:44,920 --> 03:06:51,829
Just junk, right?

1187
03:07:01,909 --> 03:07:07,290
I want to overload his brain

1188
03:07:16,469 --> 03:07:18,469
I can all right. All right. All right

1189
03:07:19,510 --> 03:07:24,569
I'm ready to experiment. Oh good. I'll let sister. They know to join us for the experiment

1190
03:07:30,809 --> 03:07:34,649
We'll get started now. We're gonna lock in and have like a battle inside of our heads

1191
03:07:36,920 --> 03:07:39,000
I see what we have an eye and e is there an o

1192
03:07:39,639 --> 03:07:53,590
He's ready for you. He looks strong. Hey by good specimen to conclude this phase. We'll get started when sister lays here

1193
03:07:55,750 --> 03:07:57,750
It's gonna be a mind battle. Yeah

1194
03:07:57,750 --> 03:07:59,750
we're both gonna be like

1195
03:08:00,979 --> 03:08:04,940
Came to his senses. I see sister lay

1196
03:08:05,659 --> 03:08:08,010
Yes

1197
03:08:08,010 --> 03:08:10,010
Please I need space

1198
03:08:10,409 --> 03:08:19,690
What sister lay yes, we're about to perform the final test of this project here we go

1199
03:08:21,719 --> 03:08:28,629
Hijack the data

1200
03:08:35,879 --> 03:08:46,420
Ready when jimmy let's start at 100 signal spectrum. What am I supposed to do here? I mean, there's no need

1201
03:08:46,979 --> 03:08:52,819
The subject is clean cooperative. I was thinking 25 percent and then adjust if necessary

1202
03:08:53,139 --> 03:08:59,659
60 percent is minimum. We'll get no motor control below. Am I actually gonna like blow his head up with my brain?

1203
03:09:00,219 --> 03:09:06,440
Long experiment page 109 initiated operation 60 percent

1204
03:09:07,239 --> 03:09:09,989
I feel like I was supposed to mess with something

1205
03:09:09,989 --> 03:09:14,309
page 109 initiated load suggestion motor control

1206
03:09:15,500 --> 03:09:17,500
44.1

1207
03:09:22,860 --> 03:09:27,930
The signal's too low resist

1208
03:09:30,620 --> 03:09:33,909
The signal is too weak. We'll get nothing

1209
03:09:38,969 --> 03:09:43,450
100 percent

1210
03:09:45,659 --> 03:09:50,139
Is the meter on the right it's safe don't resist

1211
03:09:56,149 --> 03:10:03,229
100 percent I can't say continuing experiment h 109 volt meter. Should I watch should I watch the volt meter?

1212
03:10:20,840 --> 03:10:26,969
100 let's go

1213
03:10:27,530 --> 03:10:29,530
Is

1214
03:10:37,770 --> 03:10:39,770
Voltage is getting too high

1215
03:10:50,940 --> 03:11:02,829
We're going to a hundred and fifty percent attack him with the soda

1216
03:11:03,309 --> 03:11:15,600
Became to be without pain calling it quits hush. You need rest. Okay. Okay a short break

1217
03:11:20,350 --> 03:11:29,770
What the fuck how did I did it wrong

1218
03:11:40,409 --> 03:11:44,489
link impulse drink point zero two two to defining a moment so

1219
03:11:45,209 --> 03:11:47,209
Do I have to overload? I have to overload his chair

1220
03:11:48,680 --> 03:11:53,399
Because I I definitely have to overload the chair. Hold on the same that calibration unit in the other room

1221
03:11:53,399 --> 03:11:59,100
I'm supposed to wait. What I was doing it, right?

1222
03:12:00,840 --> 03:12:03,149
Wait, what?

1223
03:12:03,149 --> 03:12:05,149
You can't do it on the first one

1224
03:12:05,229 --> 03:12:06,430
Oh

1225
03:12:06,430 --> 03:12:07,389
Okay

1226
03:12:07,389 --> 03:12:13,559
Run simulation an experiment. I need to do it. Uh, I thought if that was it like, oh well, we'll try it again

1227
03:12:13,719 --> 03:12:15,719
I thought we were resetting his encounter

1228
03:12:15,879 --> 03:12:20,540
Oh, okay. I thought I I needed to do something else

1229
03:12:30,809 --> 03:12:32,809
ADHD dumb fuck

1230
03:12:34,729 --> 03:12:38,000
Jesus

1231
03:12:40,729 --> 03:12:54,700
He's ready for you hush he looks strong good specimen to conclude this phase so

1232
03:12:55,739 --> 03:13:01,659
The test subject came to his senses. I see. Hi good. Just delay. Yes

1233
03:13:02,379 --> 03:13:05,579
We're about to perform the final test of this project

1234
03:13:08,379 --> 03:13:12,459
All right, sit down let's get it saved right before he sits down so I can just not have to do this again

1235
03:13:12,540 --> 03:13:17,840
Because something screws the fuck up. Okay sick. Yeah sick sick sick sick sick. Yeah sick

1236
03:13:22,940 --> 03:13:36,200
Take a seat ready when you generally let's start at 100 signal strength 100 percent. I mean

1237
03:13:39,799 --> 03:13:44,860
200 percent

1238
03:13:44,860 --> 03:13:50,680
60 percent is minimum. We'll get no motor control below and wasting my time but

1239
03:13:51,319 --> 03:13:56,920
60 log concluding experiment page 109 initiated we talked yesterday about

1240
03:13:58,360 --> 03:14:02,440
Going into a vr headset and controlling somebody else like an avatar in the real world

1241
03:14:04,799 --> 03:14:06,799
This is that this is what he wants to do

1242
03:14:24,969 --> 03:14:33,709
Wow, you're paying attention ban that person for six days six days in dog years

1243
03:14:33,790 --> 03:14:43,260
It can cause you real physics it's safe you're strong you can overcome it

1244
03:14:44,530 --> 03:14:53,440
100 percent do it log continuing experiment h 109 run calibration. Yeah, that'd be about that'd be about four hours

1245
03:14:54,399 --> 03:14:56,399
It's like an hour. Yeah

1246
03:15:13,059 --> 03:15:15,059
You're fucking nuts

1247
03:15:17,229 --> 03:15:26,379
It's too much it's too much it's too much

1248
03:15:34,690 --> 03:15:39,950
He is a strong one and you banned me for a little bit. It's a sex thing

1249
03:15:41,329 --> 03:15:43,329
Do not ban that person

1250
03:15:58,979 --> 03:16:03,540
Came to be without pain. I'm calling it. Nothing can stop the blob

1251
03:16:04,260 --> 03:16:07,950
Okay, okay a short break

1252
03:16:08,829 --> 03:16:10,829
I'll return with a clear head

1253
03:16:11,489 --> 03:16:16,399
God damn that assistant if they up the signal it will kill him. Oh

1254
03:16:17,200 --> 03:16:19,200
You need to be the assistant

1255
03:16:21,520 --> 03:16:24,639
I'll stick around

1256
03:16:24,639 --> 03:16:26,639
We need to get rid of I thought I just took a gun out

1257
03:16:31,200 --> 03:16:33,200
Oh, we need to be the assistant

1258
03:16:35,920 --> 03:16:42,139
No, increase the power

1259
03:16:42,139 --> 03:16:44,379
Increase power increase the power level increase power

1260
03:16:45,180 --> 03:16:48,059
Jack up power to way higher than than we can allow

1261
03:16:49,149 --> 03:16:52,260
Tons of power put the power up

1262
03:16:52,260 --> 03:16:54,479
Jack up the power

1263
03:16:54,479 --> 03:16:56,340
Just wait

1264
03:16:56,340 --> 03:17:00,770
What do you mean? Just wait

1265
03:17:00,770 --> 03:17:19,139
Kill the assistant. It's definitely I definitely mess with the server room or something

1266
03:17:19,379 --> 03:17:23,059
That has to be what I have to do. All right, I mean look at that power. We need more power power

1267
03:17:35,979 --> 03:17:38,930
God he is dumb

1268
03:17:38,930 --> 03:17:42,350
What?

1269
03:17:42,350 --> 03:17:48,579
Mm-hmm. Wait, is this the assistant?

1270
03:17:49,299 --> 03:18:02,979
Where's the assistant?

1271
03:18:02,979 --> 03:18:16,180
This is the assistant right here. You're pretending he's pretending again. Uh-oh

1272
03:18:26,909 --> 03:18:33,629
Let me read this sister lay has been pushing for hush to go further than advisable in his testing

1273
03:18:33,629 --> 03:18:39,100
But his personal assistant has convinced him. It's too dangerous if testing is to proceed

1274
03:18:39,840 --> 03:18:45,219
That assistant might need to be taken care of the assistant needs to die

1275
03:18:55,219 --> 03:19:00,299
so

1276
03:19:00,299 --> 03:19:03,459
We need the assistant now. Give me a hand here

1277
03:19:05,680 --> 03:19:07,680
I think it's bugged out. Is it? No, it's not

1278
03:19:12,079 --> 03:19:14,079
All right. So

1279
03:19:14,079 --> 03:19:16,579
All right. So

1280
03:19:16,579 --> 03:19:22,979
All right. So why are you writing that?

1281
03:19:22,979 --> 03:19:25,870
You already failed it

1282
03:19:25,870 --> 03:19:27,870
The other lady not the one doing that. Yeah, I know but

1283
03:19:28,430 --> 03:19:42,420
If we had missed the opportunity to you should have gotten up by now. This is a legit bug

1284
03:19:43,139 --> 03:19:49,040
Oh

1285
03:19:49,040 --> 03:19:55,469
Is it 13?

1286
03:19:55,469 --> 03:19:57,370
1936

1287
03:19:57,430 --> 03:20:12,700
1840 he's supposed to get up. It's not bugged. I think I broke it

1288
03:20:18,079 --> 03:20:19,680
Shoot him and run

1289
03:20:19,680 --> 03:20:46,299
I'm not gonna do that. Like we did the last one just shoot him and run. Okay, so is it actually bugged?

1290
03:20:47,870 --> 03:20:52,520
It's not bugged. Why are you guys are people just gaslighting me? Am I getting gaslighted?

1291
03:20:54,010 --> 03:21:13,610
He's literally supposed to get up. I mean, there's only three people. You know what? Let's just try this you got up

1292
03:21:27,950 --> 03:21:30,270
You're gonna be part of something truly amazing

1293
03:21:30,989 --> 03:21:32,989
He's a genius

1294
03:21:37,469 --> 03:21:40,860
It actually did bug oh

1295
03:21:41,659 --> 03:21:45,500
Actually had to get up if you could just go along with it, okay

1296
03:21:46,299 --> 03:21:49,500
Don't try to resist the impulses he sends

1297
03:21:50,379 --> 03:21:52,700
I don't want him to exert himself

1298
03:21:53,739 --> 03:21:55,739
Can you do that?

1299
03:22:11,870 --> 03:22:14,829
That's the most brutal thing i've ever seen

1300
03:22:24,329 --> 03:22:26,329
Oh my god my stomach

1301
03:22:28,409 --> 03:22:29,690
Okay

1302
03:22:29,690 --> 03:22:47,049
It's time to do the test again get to the skies. No, I have to be the patient

1303
03:22:54,110 --> 03:22:57,819
Wait, why are you doing that?

1304
03:22:58,139 --> 03:23:12,920
I hit an enrage timer. What happened save save it save save save save save. It's good. Just wait

1305
03:23:14,139 --> 03:23:16,540
I have to wait up here. You're gonna make me sit up here

1306
03:23:17,180 --> 03:23:21,040
I you I have to sit up here and not do anything stupid

1307
03:23:28,520 --> 03:23:30,520
Oh my god, are you kidding me?

1308
03:23:30,840 --> 03:23:46,139
These people are gonna wake up by the time he gets back. Just make some noise in the meantime. Okay, that's yeah

1309
03:23:46,139 --> 03:23:48,139
Sure. What do I have? I have a meaty bone

1310
03:23:56,829 --> 03:23:59,149
Sorry, excuse me. You're not allowed here, you know

1311
03:24:01,079 --> 03:24:15,790
You know what the best part about that was

1312
03:24:15,790 --> 03:24:52,600
That yeah, it didn't make any noise. I hit him with like the meat part. What's wrong? Is the gun I need help here

1313
03:24:53,000 --> 03:25:01,239
I couldn't fucking wait. I couldn't I couldn't wait. I couldn't wait. I couldn't wait. I couldn't wait. I couldn't wait

1314
03:25:01,319 --> 03:25:05,840
I couldn't wait. I couldn't fucking wait. I couldn't wait

1315
03:25:07,479 --> 03:25:18,799
I'm gonna take my hands off. I'm gonna take my hands off the mouse and shit. Well, I did wait

1316
03:25:18,959 --> 03:25:21,520
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, let me give it. I gotta take some credit here

1317
03:25:22,520 --> 03:25:27,000
I didn't know that walking by this guy would make him immediately be like hey get back here

1318
03:25:27,399 --> 03:25:30,760
So I had to hit him in the face of the meat and I and I had to improvise so I dragged him into

1319
03:25:30,760 --> 03:25:32,360
The thing and I've left the gun

1320
03:25:32,360 --> 03:25:44,329
I'm not moving not going anywhere

1321
03:25:44,329 --> 03:25:46,329
You were fine when you took a step back

1322
03:25:46,719 --> 03:25:57,680
Idiot call me an idiot. How dare you? That was my day. My day is going pretty well

1323
03:25:58,620 --> 03:26:02,139
First thing I see in chat doesn't matter what it is. It doesn't even if it's an unedible. I'm gonna eat it for dinner

1324
03:26:02,139 --> 03:26:10,639
What is it?

1325
03:26:10,639 --> 03:26:13,129
ass

1326
03:26:13,530 --> 03:26:15,530
No, the first thing was burger

1327
03:26:16,270 --> 03:26:21,770
Excellent. Hey, you know a burger could be ass

1328
03:26:22,409 --> 03:26:24,489
It could be

1329
03:26:24,489 --> 03:26:28,010
Right. It's ground beef that could be like ass. So

1330
03:26:28,649 --> 03:26:46,840
I'm good. Here we go

1331
03:26:46,840 --> 03:26:48,840
And it's between two buns. Yeah

1332
03:26:49,479 --> 03:26:53,129
That's that's fine

1333
03:26:53,129 --> 03:26:54,969
Don't load save

1334
03:26:54,969 --> 03:26:59,450
All right, let's go

1335
03:27:02,090 --> 03:27:05,290
Push yourself harder

1336
03:27:10,329 --> 03:27:14,969
Yes, 100 percent I feel strong I can take him

1337
03:27:20,079 --> 03:27:20,959
um

1338
03:27:20,959 --> 03:27:24,780
So does 47 just have some type of power where he can resist this dude?

1339
03:27:26,649 --> 03:27:30,889
I didn't do anything special. Like i'm just 47. He's going into my head and stuff

1340
03:27:33,850 --> 03:27:35,850
I hope his head explodes

1341
03:27:36,809 --> 03:27:43,290
What does that say on the safe and then gamer he's gonna go full gamer mode or something I don't understand what's that mean

1342
03:27:52,040 --> 03:28:06,590
So I should just let him do it oh resist nope safe

1343
03:28:09,000 --> 03:28:11,370
The way we have to build it up. Okay

1344
03:28:24,120 --> 03:28:29,879
47 has a huile brain

1345
03:28:36,569 --> 03:28:41,260
Experiment h 109 calibration 120

1346
03:28:42,139 --> 03:28:44,780
I have to wait like right to the very end and then pull it

1347
03:28:48,299 --> 03:28:50,299
That was a plus two chat joke it was

1348
03:28:59,100 --> 03:29:03,559
Let's go his head's gonna explode you're gonna get to see the head explosion part

1349
03:29:25,309 --> 03:29:30,459
Brain blast both targets down good

1350
03:29:31,260 --> 03:29:33,020
Give me a second

1351
03:29:33,020 --> 03:29:36,299
And i'm in you can now access the core 47

1352
03:29:43,610 --> 03:29:45,610
I'm fine, by the way

1353
03:29:46,860 --> 03:29:59,549
Okay, I need the data core are there so many I don't know which one is which

1354
03:30:15,159 --> 03:30:17,790
All the guard what

1355
03:30:31,020 --> 03:30:40,889
Where's the guard just got some personal shit going on where's the guard all the guard

1356
03:30:40,889 --> 03:30:48,239
You're currently enough shit it's too late

1357
03:30:48,879 --> 03:31:10,989
So I followed it was too late. That's all right one earbud andy. Oh, is that the problem?

1358
03:31:12,239 --> 03:31:25,579
Okay, did the guards say follow me follow me freeman so focused that he just forgets

1359
03:31:25,659 --> 03:31:31,930
I mean, this is a nice big kitchen. He wants to be alone. We can just sit in the corner. We won't bother

1360
03:31:33,770 --> 03:31:36,090
What hey you what the

1361
03:31:37,290 --> 03:31:39,290
Hold on. I'm very

1362
03:31:39,290 --> 03:31:47,950
Just wait, what do you mean? Wait, I was wrong again. I turn around

1363
03:31:48,510 --> 03:31:54,350
Is somebody in the room?

1364
03:31:54,350 --> 03:31:55,870
Follow that guy

1365
03:31:55,870 --> 03:32:29,930
Go back to preschool. Why don't you go back to preschool? I could be way better painted than you could be in preschool

1366
03:32:30,569 --> 03:32:33,850
They used to hang my shit up in the classroom

1367
03:32:34,489 --> 03:32:36,489
I did that they did not do that to you

1368
03:32:37,979 --> 03:32:41,739
I would be they put it on the table with some tape and it'd be on a table as a placemat

1369
03:32:42,299 --> 03:32:46,010
I didn't do that to you

1370
03:32:46,010 --> 03:32:48,010
Okay, I need that data core

1371
03:32:48,010 --> 03:33:00,379
You save it. All right, so we gotta keep going down. It's all the way down

1372
03:33:05,209 --> 03:33:07,850
It's a placemat

1373
03:33:07,850 --> 03:33:11,290
All right. We gotta get you out of here quick sirs. This is where I this is where I killed this guy

1374
03:33:11,850 --> 03:33:22,399
I mean like it's a perfect place

1375
03:33:49,100 --> 03:33:50,540
All right, let's get that

1376
03:33:50,540 --> 03:34:28,040
Don't do it. Should I beat this guy? You do so don't pretend to be bad. It's it's not funny

1377

03:34:37,420 --> 03:34:40,860
Of course, i'm gonna keep pretending at video games and like falling down and stuff. Are you crazy?

1379
03:34:41,500 --> 03:34:54,959
This is a statue

1380
03:34:54,959 --> 03:35:14,270
A horror game soon. Uh, maybe this is a very big level, isn't it? This place I I forgot that we were outside at one point

1381
03:35:14,750 --> 03:35:18,670

1382
03:35:18,670 --> 03:35:20,670
it was not a

1383
03:35:20,750 --> 03:35:22,350
There was a facility

1384
03:35:22,350 --> 03:35:24,510
We brought a bunch of people alive in a room

1385
03:35:25,149 --> 03:35:29,069
In this weird ai room. This is a huge level. This level is a monster level

1386
03:35:34,059 --> 03:35:35,340
I keep going

1387
03:35:35,340 --> 03:35:38,989
There's nothing special that I need to do here

1388
03:35:51,229 --> 03:35:53,229
Like look at this. I forgot this even existed

1389
03:36:15,770 --> 03:36:18,079

03:36:18,959 --> 03:36:20,079
Okay

1391
03:36:20,079 --> 03:36:23,840
Did that guy just say security's tight? We're not allowed to let you guards in here

1392
03:36:25,770 --> 03:36:33,770
Excuse me

1393
03:36:33,770 --> 03:36:37,370
I am a guard

1394
03:36:37,370 --> 03:36:40,059
What the fuck are you talking about?

1395
03:36:40,139 --> 03:36:42,379
We're guards. We can't let you guards in here either

1396
03:36:46,059 --> 03:36:50,489
All right. Well, I gotta get in there. It's the same lady from earlier

03:37:09,239 --> 03:37:37,389
Both of you go check it out

1400
03:37:38,030 --> 03:37:39,309
Can't let you through

1401
03:37:39,309 --> 03:37:41,309
Sorry for the inconvenience

1402
03:37:41,309 --> 03:37:47,840
We have someone in serious trouble could be an assault

1403
03:37:51,280 --> 03:37:54,989
I was trying to get behind him. He didn't go far enough

1404
03:37:55,549 --> 03:38:04,409
What was I doing? I I was trying when I threw the fire extinguisher one

1405
03:38:04,409 --> 03:38:10,540
I got to keep going so I could choke him over there and put it this is not mafia

1406
03:38:10,540 --> 03:38:15,629
You're playing it like mafia. That's a really weird thing to be compared to be playing like

1407
03:38:16,760 --> 03:38:18,520
Hey, this is not mafia

1408
03:38:18,520 --> 03:38:20,760
I mean like a third person. What do you mean?

1409
03:38:23,420 --> 03:38:25,739
Dta would be better. Wouldn't it like comparing to mafia?

1410
03:38:32,639 --> 03:38:38,329
Free the non-subs that depends that they're gonna behave. I needed to go like there

1411
03:38:44,440 --> 03:38:57,790
The guy on the right saw that how the guy on the right see that i'll take any chances you go check it out

03:39:07,610 --> 03:39:35,000
Oh, come on lady

03:44:21,899 --> 03:44:36,350
This is like the biggest map in hitman. I gotta get one of these guys to come in here

1433
03:44:43,420 --> 03:44:44,940
I need to screw up

1434
03:44:44,940 --> 03:45:06,979
How do I get somebody to come over here? I know there's a gun in the trash can

Where is this body?

1444
03:46:37,520 --> 03:46:55,469
I need to get one of these disguises which one of these is silent. I don't have anything silent anymore

1445
03:46:56,110 --> 03:47:05,260

1446
03:47:10,450 --> 03:47:18,430
Damn it. They saw it

1447
03:47:18,430 --> 03:47:20,829

1453
03:47:49,520 --> 03:47:53,040
Now I remember. All right. Now i'm gonna go get the gun and i'm gonna snipe somebody

Get all these knives and shit, too

1458
03:48:15,489 --> 03:48:17,489
I gave myself an entire arsenal

1459
03:48:17,649 --> 03:48:28,579
Okay, here we go. The plan here

1460
03:48:29,950 --> 03:48:31,950
Is we're gonna go

1461
03:48:32,510 --> 03:48:35,809
This way I just need a disguise

1462
03:48:36,290 --> 03:48:42,420
It's got to be one person hanging out somewhere

1463
03:48:43,649 --> 03:48:44,450
one

1464
03:48:44,450 --> 03:49:02,540
Wait a minute. Can I get in there? Wait, this is just the core

1465
03:49:08,940 --> 03:49:30,299
What? Um, what about the lady up there? Good. You're alone. I'm sealing the room and dimming the windows 47

1466
03:49:31,100 --> 03:49:33,100
No need to worry about intruders. Oh

1467
03:49:34,459 --> 03:49:40,290
What about that person? Oh, what's on the ground here?

1468
03:49:51,809 --> 03:49:53,809
Opening up the data core

1469
03:49:57,149 --> 03:49:59,149
Holy shit

1470
03:49:59,729 --> 03:50:01,170
It's all here

1471
03:50:01,170 --> 03:50:06,930
Clients operatives every hit the ica ever sanctioned enough to shut them down for good

1472
03:50:07,969 --> 03:50:12,530
But first you need to locate all files referencing diana and yourself. It's not in this mission, too, is it?

1473
03:50:17,340 --> 03:50:19,340
Oh, okay. It's a cutscene

1474
03:50:35,200 --> 03:50:37,200
We're gonna start overwatch back up again

1475
03:50:39,569 --> 03:50:41,569
Send the word out to all the operatives

1476
03:50:42,219 --> 03:50:46,739
taking lives

1477
03:50:46,739 --> 03:50:48,510
disorder

1478
03:50:48,510 --> 03:50:52,430
Well, we are here basic training starts at 600 hours

1479
03:50:53,149 --> 03:50:54,590
I should

1480
03:50:54,590 --> 03:50:56,110
Leave you to prepare

1481
03:50:56,750 --> 03:51:00,270
Perhaps I see possibility where others see limitation do I have to escape?

1482
03:51:01,469 --> 03:51:02,909
I choose him

1483
03:51:02,909 --> 03:51:04,909
The two of you go way back

1484
03:51:05,379 --> 03:51:07,440
I didn't realize that you

1485
03:51:07,440 --> 03:51:12,129
I don't know. I get why at what point does the lady that was looking over this go

1486
03:51:13,250 --> 03:51:22,850
I can't see somebody blacked out every window killing the past delete the files

1487
03:51:23,569 --> 03:51:38,000
Okay, good. I've set up a link to an information non-profit site

1488
03:51:38,639 --> 03:51:41,360
When you press that button is up there and the whole world will know

1489
03:51:42,159 --> 03:51:44,159
There's no undo 47

1490
03:51:44,399 --> 03:51:46,399
This will shut the ica down for good

1491
03:51:47,219 --> 03:51:48,180
you

1492
03:51:48,180 --> 03:51:50,180
Really? Okay with this

1493
03:51:50,180 --> 03:51:52,610
It's who you've been for so long

1494
03:51:52,610 --> 03:51:54,850
This is I'd make a choice

1495
03:51:54,930 --> 03:51:56,930
upload or

1496
03:51:58,450 --> 03:52:00,450
upload only

1497
03:52:00,690 --> 03:52:08,659
I'll just return things to normal no need to alert than we were here prematurely

1498
03:52:13,040 --> 03:52:15,040
I better save this shit

1499
03:52:15,440 --> 03:52:21,790
We're blown 47 give me a save point for a little while use the fence to get out go now

1500
03:52:28,459 --> 03:52:31,280
Use the fence this is bad that means they'll shoot on sight

1501
03:52:32,000 --> 03:52:34,500
I'm gonna create some havoc 47

1502
03:52:34,500 --> 03:52:36,500
You're gonna create some havoc

1503
03:52:36,500 --> 03:52:39,389
Make the core melt down maybe we'll divert their attention a bit

1504
03:52:46,420 --> 03:53:06,260
There's a photo I can take over there

1505
03:53:06,340 --> 03:53:10,110

The balls in your court miss burnwood. I do have other candidates, you know

1558
04:00:33,360 --> 04:00:35,760
Most of whom have never tied me to a chair

1559
04:00:36,639 --> 04:00:38,479
You've seen the news

1560
04:00:38,479 --> 04:00:40,719
That was 47 acting on his own

1561
04:00:41,440 --> 04:00:45,680
He is untethered. He is unstoppable and he cannot be bargained with

1562
04:00:46,319 --> 04:00:48,319
He will find you. Mr. Edwards

I saw it coming from my every flight all the video games, you know

1569
04:01:17,920 --> 04:01:20,899
You just know

1570
04:01:20,899 --> 04:01:23,649
Okay, um mission accomplished. Let's keep going

1571
04:01:24,530 --> 04:01:27,969
next up

1572
04:01:27,969 --> 04:01:50,430
A farewell how many missions are there two three left in the game? I found something

1573
04:01:51,069 --> 04:01:58,700
Buenos Aires international airport this morning now watch this

1574
04:02:00,450 --> 04:02:03,780

1575
04:02:04,500 --> 04:02:09,219
Turns out that a top providence operative owns a vineyard in the area three faces were on that

1576
04:02:09,700 --> 04:02:14,180
Of infamous new york law firm morgan yates and colin and that fucking terrifying look behind the luggage

1577
04:02:15,299 --> 04:02:19,700
Today you can barely see it fucked up. She's infiltrated them. She's sending a message

1578
04:02:20,700 --> 04:02:26,510
She needs my help could have fooled me. You don't know her anyway

1579
04:02:27,899 --> 04:02:29,659
You're going after her

1580
04:02:29,659 --> 04:02:36,059
You'll need to deal with the herald her name is tamara vidal former cia asset and political firebrand

1581
04:02:36,940 --> 04:02:41,659
She's a master of surveillance and the constant's most trusted aid. She'll have eyes everywhere

1582
04:02:42,299 --> 04:02:44,299
You won't get far as long as she's in the game

1583
04:02:44,780 --> 04:02:46,780
Why are you telling me this?

1584
04:02:46,940 --> 04:02:48,940
I thought you were out. Yeah

1585
04:02:50,159 --> 04:02:53,100

Landed out smuggled items. I don't have anything

04:03:24,340 --> 04:03:26,659
Fiber wire or a snow globe

1594
04:03:31,020 --> 04:03:33,280

1597
04:03:41,600 --> 04:03:53,979

04:03:57,729 --> 04:04:00,209
I've not used the fiber wire once the entire game

1601
04:04:00,930 --> 04:04:06,909
I don't think I ever have

1602
04:04:06,909 --> 04:04:11,840
P break collective p break. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I don't i'm not sure i'm gonna beat this one tonight

1604
04:04:16,100 --> 04:04:20,159
We'll finish it up tomorrow. Just want to let you know

1605
04:04:25,950 --> 04:04:28,430

We're back. Uh, let's do this for a little bit. Let's check

1611
04:07:25,299 --> 04:07:28,819
You know, we're gonna check the level out and then i'll probably stop

1612
04:07:29,379 --> 04:07:37,680
I like the idea of actually starting a new level in one of the last levels tomorrow

1613
04:07:38,159 --> 04:07:46,030
Let's go. Let's go walk around though. Let's take a look mr. Green. There he is

1614
04:07:49,819 --> 04:07:58,909
Oh, look at that fireman, but he is real fireman is real. What do you mean fireman is real?

1615
04:08:00,190 --> 04:08:20,770
Huh, he's real iron man is a shitty character. Um, what does that have to do with fireman?

1616
04:08:21,170 --> 04:08:47,010
So that's diana we're gonna find out what the real allegiance is because you're not an idiot

1617
04:09:02,829 --> 04:09:11,780
No, no talking. Oh replay. Whatever do not ele you know what my favorite hitman level is the ones where

1618
04:09:12,340 --> 04:09:16,239
There's a target and they're literally right next to you when you start the mission

1619
04:09:16,479 --> 04:09:20,129
It's like I get you could just shoot them right there and run and leave

1620
04:09:21,069 --> 04:09:22,510
But you shouldn't

1621
04:09:22,510 --> 04:09:30,930
What are you doing?

1622
04:09:30,930 --> 04:09:43,469
Has everybody been quiet was it the dot dot dots? Oh god. Damn it. I've

1628
04:10:47,010 --> 04:10:49,809
I'm this close to becoming the next constant

1629
04:10:50,450 --> 04:10:53,170
I'll be able to dismantle providence from the inside

1630
04:10:54,049 --> 04:10:56,049
Only one man stands in my way

1631
04:10:56,530 --> 04:10:57,969

That we're here to go partners legal counsel for years

He's the top candidate but remove him from the playing field

1634
04:11:05,170 --> 04:11:10,020

1635
04:11:10,020 --> 04:11:12,100

1636
04:11:12,639 --> 04:11:14,180
