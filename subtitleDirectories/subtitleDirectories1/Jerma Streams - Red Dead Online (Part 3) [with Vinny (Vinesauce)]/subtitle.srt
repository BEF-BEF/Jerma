1
00:00:01,659 --> 00:00:03,660
Just because.

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:09,160
Alright, so now you're in the party? Okay.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:15,109
We're getting playstationed. Yeah, that doesn't matter.

4
00:00:15,109 --> 00:00:17,989
Alright, so, join the party.

5
00:00:17,989 --> 00:00:20,300
Here we are. Okay.

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,859
Now play together.

7
00:00:23,859 --> 00:00:25,859
Play together is a feature that makes it easy to play multiple games

8
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,899
with a place to play to power up the AI. Okay.

9
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:32,460
How do you want to play together? Join game session.

10
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:40,700
What's the method?

11
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,640
And then join friends game.

12
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,539
Oh, okay, okay. That would make sense.

13
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:50,299
Alright, so I'm just going to look into

14
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:52,299
free roam and just try to jump into your game.

15
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:56,520
That would make sense, wouldn't it?

16
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,359
Oh, okay.

17
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:02,359
So while we're doing this, have you played through all the single player yet in this?

18
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:04,359
Uh, I have not.

19
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:06,359
I'm like 40% of the way through.

20
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:09,239
Okay, so you're on like chapter 3 then?

21
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:11,239
Yeah.

22
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:13,239
I just barely am like into chapter 3, I think.

23
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:17,340
Yeah, there's a lot left.

24
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,340
I mean, there's a hot air balloon.

25
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,769
Really? There's a hot air balloon?

26
00:01:21,769 --> 00:01:23,769
No, that was you.

27
00:01:23,769 --> 00:01:26,140
Ooh.

28
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,140
There's an Elvis impersonator. I love those things.

29
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,140
That's some of my favorite means of travel.

30
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,500
I'm glad you're bringing it up.

31
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,870
Yeah, I want to know all about that in a couple minutes.

32
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,870
But before we, um,

33
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,870
before we do that, I want to also say there's a game called Rust

34
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,870
that just implemented hot air balloons.

35
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,870
Oh my god, are you serious?

36
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,870
Yeah, swear to god.

37
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,870
Alright, let me, uh, give me one second.

38
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,939
I have to say hello to somebody.

39
00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:51,939
Somebody just knocked on my door.

40
00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:53,939
I gotta say hello to them. Hold on.

41
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:55,939
Hey, it's you guys! It's my stream!

42
00:01:55,939 --> 00:01:57,939
My stream!

43
00:01:57,939 --> 00:01:59,939
I'm half expecting this to be

44
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:01,939
It's not.

45
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:03,939
Uh, oh.

46
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:06,250
I just want to say hello.

47
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,250
Playing Red Dead Online with Vinnie.

48
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,020
In case you didn't know, just want to make sure you're aware of that.

49
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,020
Hey, how you doing?

50
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,710
It's me, Elvis.

51
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,710
Vinnie Vinesauce.

52
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,710
That was fucking really good.

53
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,710
That was really,

54
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,710
that was really good.

55
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,710
I had to come back and say that.

56
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,710
I'm half expecting this to be a skit.

57
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,710
I had to fucking clown here.

58
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,710
I just sent him home.

59
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:35,080
Hey, that's Vinnie!

60
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,900
Wait, is that Vinnie?

61
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,520
That's Vinnie! Vinnie!

62
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,520
Hey, I made it!

63
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,520
Let me see your character. What is, what is this character?

64
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,520
My character is loathsome looking.

65
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,270
Let me see yours.

66
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,270
Yeah, I hate my character. At least, at least you're a dude looks like.

67
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,639
You're about to say me.

68
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:56,330
You're about to say looks like me.

69
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:59,590
You think that's what I look like?

70
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,590
No. Well hey, I mean, if anything, we could be in a band called The Stooges.

71
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,590
I look like Iggy Pop. You look like the drummer.

72
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,590
So I guess we're good.

73
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,960
Let me add you to a posse.

74
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,139
I think we can do that now.

75
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:12,139
No, this looks like the taxi driver from The Muppets.

76
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,409
Don't make fun of my face ever again!

77
00:03:18,409 --> 00:03:20,409
Alright, so now we're friends.

78
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:22,409
That was a friend punch.

79
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:25,030
So, get your hat.

80
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,530
You look like Solid Snake from the third one.

81
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:32,180
Squeeze the hop.

82
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,180
Oh yeah, I started the cycle.

83
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,680
I got a posse.

84
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,680
You must be able to pay fee to create a posse.

85
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,300
I must be able to pay fee?

86
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,740
Fuck you, Rockstar.

87
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,740
That's like a funny laugh out loud Rockstar

88
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,740
is taking payment joke, right?

89
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,340
Uh huh. Oh, it's real though.

90
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,340
You're on my all temporary posse.

91
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,780
Alright, so invites.

92
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,860
Your tent has been moved

93
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,860
to Vinesauce's camp.

94
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,349
So we share a camp now.

95
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:06,039
Yeah.

96
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:08,039
Let's just do a quick test.

97
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,539
Alright, let me use your hat though.

98
00:04:10,539 --> 00:04:13,419
I'm ready for my picture.

99
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,419
Alright, friendly fire is confirmed off.

100
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:17,420
Which is good because I didn't know if that was going to work.

101
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,420
But I have to figure out which one of our hats

102
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,100
I like better on my hat.

103
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,730
I hate my hat, so.

104
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,899
Where did you get this thing?

105
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:28,899
It was a default, like jabroni hat.

106
00:04:28,899 --> 00:04:30,899
So is this one.

107
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:33,850
Then why is mine dirtier than yours?

108
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,850
I don't know actually. What have you been doing?

109
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,850
What have you been rolling around in the mud?

110
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,850
I think so. Last time I played this, I think that's what I did.

111
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,730
Alright, let's go have fun.

112
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,730
Yeah, I don't know where that is.

113
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:46,730
So this is a bunch of random missions.

114
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,730
Have you done any online at all?

115
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,220
I've done some of the missions online, yeah.

116
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,220
I've done like a death match.

117
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,720
I've done some of the team based stuff.

118
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,089
It was fun, I enjoyed it. Cool, cool.

119
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,089
Whoa, what was that? Lightning?

120
00:05:00,089 --> 00:05:02,899
There's a lightning mission starting.

121
00:05:02,899 --> 00:05:05,459
We have horses, don't we?

122
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:07,769
Somewhere we have horses.

123
00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:10,199
My horse is coming from behind here.

124
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:12,889
This is interesting. Showdown series.

125
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:14,889
Large match. Oh, this is the stuff I did.

126
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:19,300
This stuff is pretty fun.

127
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,300
You want to just ride off and like...

128
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,300
You want to just lasso people and torture them?

129
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,540
Oh yeah, that's the first thing you want to do when you get online.

130
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,540
Why don't we torture people?

131
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:33,000
That sounds like fun.

132
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,939
Like this guy.

133
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:42,009
He's pulling out his gun. Well, we killed him.

134
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,009
He's dead.

135
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:46,009
I guess we did torture him.

136
00:05:46,009 --> 00:05:48,009
He was tortured in life.

137
00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:50,009
We got a murder trophy?

138
00:05:50,009 --> 00:05:52,009
I guess that means we're bad.

139
00:05:52,009 --> 00:05:54,009
I was wondering why...

140
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:56,009
Are you a good guy or are you a bad guy in these games?

141
00:05:58,009 --> 00:06:00,009
I'm more or less a good guy online.

142
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:02,009
Though I've done some horrendously questionable things.

143
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:04,009
How about you?

144
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:06,009
I'm always a good guy.

145
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:08,009
No matter what.

146
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:10,009
Any opportunity that presents itself, I always do the right thing.

147
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:14,379
Is that going to be a problem for this stream?

148
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:16,680
I'm not sure.

149
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,680
We may have some disagreements.

150
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,180
I fed someone to an alligator.

151
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,459
I hear gunshots.

152
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:27,459
Okay, that's a good deed.

153
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:29,459
Just trying to do good deeds over here.

154
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:32,540
Yeah, that seems like it was a good deed.

155
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,540
For sure.

156
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,540
I just ran past that guy's horse.

157
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,540
That poor, frightened, scared horse.

158
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,540
He just killed its owner.

159
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,540
I was trying to help that guy.

160
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,540
There was flies around his head.

161
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:47,100
I was trying to get rid of them.

162
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,339
This is like his camp.

163
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:52,089
Oh man, that guy just good-guided me.

164
00:06:52,089 --> 00:06:54,089
Get that good guy down there.

165
00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:56,259
I got him.

166
00:06:56,259 --> 00:06:59,589
Can you help me?

167
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:01,769
Yeah, let me find you.

168
00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:03,769
Is this left or dead?

169
00:07:03,769 --> 00:07:06,709
I think so.

170
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:08,709
You're bleeding out and you're dead.

171
00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:16,339
That guy's whole camp just disappeared.

172
00:07:16,339 --> 00:07:19,800
I'm going to do an emote.

173
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,800
I'm going to wave. I want to be friends.

174
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,800
Are you going to be friends with this guy?

175
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,980
I'm going to try to be friends with him.

176
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,860
I'm going to offer the twig of peace.

177
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,860
What's the emote wheel?

178
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,860
You hold L2, you press R1,

179
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,860
and then you get an emote.

180
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,860
You can do an emote wheel.

181
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:42,569
Please tell this guy

182
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:44,569
over the fake voice chat.

183
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:46,569
Oh, never mind.

184
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:49,129
What?

185
00:07:49,129 --> 00:07:51,129
I didn't try to do anything.

186
00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:53,129
I think he has his flag up.

187
00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:56,779
I don't think we can do anything to him.

188
00:07:56,779 --> 00:07:58,779
I didn't know that was a thing, but I'm glad it is.

189
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:01,079
I'm going to farewell handshake this guy.

190
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:03,079
Never mind.

191
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:05,079
I tried.

192
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:11,689
It's just like GTA Online.

193
00:08:11,689 --> 00:08:13,689
Excuse me, partner.

194
00:08:13,689 --> 00:08:18,149
You go.

195
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:21,350
Over the table, quick.

196
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:25,959
Don't let him get away.

197
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:27,959
I don't think we can

198
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,959
do a whole lot with this dude.

199
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,959
I feel like the game has

200
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:33,960
some safety checks in place.

201
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,960
This dude wants to be peaceful

202
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,960
and we're just trying to run him down with all the horses.

203
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,259
All right.

204
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:42,259
That was fun.

205
00:08:42,259 --> 00:08:44,259
Yeah, I enjoyed that for all

206
00:08:44,259 --> 00:08:46,259
three seconds.

207
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:48,259
There's another thing here.

208
00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:50,259
I set a waypoint off.

209
00:08:50,259 --> 00:08:52,259
You can see it, but there seems to be a group of people.

210
00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:54,259
What are you doing?

211
00:08:54,259 --> 00:08:56,259
I just figured I was going to come over here.

212
00:08:56,259 --> 00:08:58,259
I'm not a very good driver.

213
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:00,259
My horse does not have

214
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:02,259
the load-bearing potential for this kind of thing, right?

215
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:04,259
It's all right. Trust me.

216
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:06,259
If I drive one of these cars,

217
00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:08,259
I'm going into a bench post.

218
00:09:08,259 --> 00:09:10,259
All right. Fair enough.

219
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:16,519
So, you know,

220
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:18,820
hot air balloon?

221
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,820
Yeah. Pretty much how it works is

222
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,820
you go up in the air.

223
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,820
And why are these people all ghosts?

224
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,820
I don't know. What is this?

225
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,820
They're made of vapor.

226
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,820
Why are they like Metal Gear Solid

227
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,820
invisible? Why are they able to shoot us?

228
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,820
Hold on. We'll take care of this.

229
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:41,799
Wait, they're ghosts, but they can shoot us still.

230
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:43,799
How does it

231
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:45,799
make any sense? Kill the NPC.

232
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:48,039
Kill the NPC.

233
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:50,039
Trying.

234
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:52,039
Fuck their flight path giver.

235
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:54,409
Just like the Crossroads back in the early 2000s.

236
00:09:54,409 --> 00:09:56,580
The NPC is the Irishman.

237
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,580
What's his name?

238
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,580
Sean.

239
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,580
I don't understand why we can't interact with these guys.

240
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,580
They can't interact with us.

241
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,580
That seems very unfair.

242
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,580
Oh, this is fair.

243
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,850
Wait, wait. Did you just do that?

244
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:14,980
Why are ghosts?

245
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,980
No, I didn't do that. The ghost bullies

246
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,980
are taking care of all this.

247
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,419
Alright, well, we found

248
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:23,720
a strange happening here.

249
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,179
This online doesn't make

250
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:29,179
a whole lot of sense to me right now.

251
00:10:29,179 --> 00:10:31,179
So they're in a different server and they're able to interact with our server.

252
00:10:31,179 --> 00:10:33,179
I don't know.

253
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:35,929
There's a

254
00:10:35,929 --> 00:10:37,929
mission here, but we can't do it because

255
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:39,929
we're in a danger zone or something.

256
00:10:39,929 --> 00:10:41,929
That's too bad. You know what? I was going to

257
00:10:41,929 --> 00:10:43,929
sabotage their vehicles.

258
00:10:43,929 --> 00:10:47,049
Vehicles? Yeah.

259
00:10:47,049 --> 00:10:49,049
I can't even sabotage their vehicles.

260
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:51,049
Oh, that guy got out of

261
00:10:51,049 --> 00:10:53,049
the phase for a second. No.

262
00:10:53,049 --> 00:10:55,049
I saw that. This is really

263
00:10:55,049 --> 00:10:57,049
Westworld shit.

264
00:10:57,049 --> 00:10:59,049
Yeah, it's kind of not fair.

265
00:10:59,049 --> 00:11:01,740
So hot air balloons, you fill

266
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,740
them with air and they go up into the sky.

267
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,740
Yeah, and then you eat all the passengers to stay alive.

268
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,169
Okay, cool.

269
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:10,169
Oh, I understand.

270
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,169
Like in a video game.

271
00:11:14,169 --> 00:11:16,169
In one of those video games.

272
00:11:16,169 --> 00:11:18,169
What's a video game where you eat stuff

273
00:11:18,169 --> 00:11:20,169
when you're

274
00:11:20,169 --> 00:11:22,169
traveling?

275
00:11:22,169 --> 00:11:26,139
Do you know? Any idea?

276
00:11:26,139 --> 00:11:28,139
No.

277
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:30,889
When you fly around...

278
00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:32,889
The Oregon Trail. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

279
00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:34,889
Except that one you drive on.

280
00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:36,889
You're on an Oregon

281
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:38,889
on the trail.

282
00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:41,830
You know,

283
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:43,830
I don't...

284
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,830
That's fucking disgusting. Why would I ever...

285
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,830
Oh boy, what have I done?

286
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:49,830
I'm assuming there's a lot

287
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,830
to the story that I'm unaware of.

288
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,830
So I'm just going to let you do you.

289
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,830
No, no, I just...

290
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:57,830
I...

291
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:00,200
It's been a while since I was in the air, so...

292
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,200
Jerma, do you have a horse reviver?

293
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,200
I think I just killed my horse.

294
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,200
I killed mine too.

295
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,200
Are you serious?

296
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,200
Yeah, I jumped off the cliff. Did you jump off

297
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,200
this one? Yeah, I jumped off this one.

298
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:16,570
Oh, now he's...

299
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,129
Oh.

300
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,750
I hope you have horse insurance.

301
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,750
I think I do. Well, whatever. These are like shitty

302
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,750
default free ones.

303
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,750
Yeah, but I named mine Oatmeal.

304
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,210
No, don't shoot oatmeal!

305
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:37,580
There you go.

306
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,779
If anything, at least turn him into food.

307
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:43,139
It won't let me stab oatmeal.

308
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:45,139
Well, now we have to walk.

309
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,139
Alright, well there's a whole gang hideout

310
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:49,139
over here. You want to go kill some stuff?

311
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:51,139
Let's go light some people up.

312
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:53,700
Okay.

313
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,700
Wait a minute.

314
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,700
I think I can skin my horse.

315
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,700
Can I skin your horse?

316
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,029
No.

317
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:07,399
I think these are the bad guys.

318
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:11,299
So we can take this place out.

319
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:13,299
That guy was like a pinball machine.

320
00:13:13,299 --> 00:13:15,929
That was pretty good.

321
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:17,929
That was really good.

322
00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:19,929
Earn, earn. We got you.

323
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:22,230
That's how a cowboy says yes

324
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,230
just in case you didn't know. They say earn, earn.

325
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:26,230
Earn, earn?

326
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,230
They say earn, earn.

327
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,409
Earn, earn.

328
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,409
Minister.

329
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:40,100
No more tears.

330
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,100
I just fucking died.

331
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,100
I was too busy paying attention to earn, earn.

332
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,100
I'm sorry.

333
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,470
The local fucking dentist.

334
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,779
You know what I mean, earn?

335
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:53,529
I've become a bit of a psychopath

336
00:13:53,529 --> 00:13:57,049
it seems.

337
00:13:57,049 --> 00:13:59,049
Ernest, Ernest.

338
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:04,759
Alright, I'm coming to rescue you.

339
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:08,340
Don't worry. Don't worry. If you die I got a horse

340
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,649
reviver. I'll take care of you.

341
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:13,080
Okay.

342
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,080
It works on people too. Same drug.

343
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,580
There's only a couple dudes left

344
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,580
so we just have to like

345
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,580
kill the main dude who's like on the docks

346
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,580
I guess. Alright, so you can stab him a hundred times.

347
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:26,580
Watch this.

348
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:30,980
Alright, we got him.

349
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,159
Fuck him up.

350
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:35,529
Ooh, that was, okay.

351
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:38,980
He's in the water now.

352
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,980
So we split every piece of treasure

353
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,980
every treasure chest we find, it's fifty-fifty, right?

354
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,980
Yes.

355
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:47,860
This we do.

356
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:54,259
Alright, come watch me stab this guy.

357
00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:56,259
Oh, you're fighting the main guy. I'm fighting like his

358
00:14:56,259 --> 00:14:58,259
I'm fighting his uncle out here.

359
00:14:58,259 --> 00:15:00,259
I just slit his throat.

360
00:15:00,259 --> 00:15:02,259
You got the guy with lumbago?

361
00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:05,980
Alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

362
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,879
Don't touch anything.

363
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:12,379
How many hats did he have?

364
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:14,379
He only had one and it says you cannot store this hat.

365
00:15:14,379 --> 00:15:16,379
Well, we're gonna have to cut it in half.

366
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:20,090
Because that's the only way that's fair.

367
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,090
It says here you can get your free Arabian

368
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:24,090
horse from the strawberry stables.

369
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,090
Someone in chat said so. If you want to

370
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:28,090
get a non-shitty horse in a bit

371
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:30,090
maybe that'll be a good thing to do on stream.

372
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,090
That'll be a good fun thing to do.

373
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:34,090
Is there any

374
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:36,090
loot box in here

375
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:38,090
or something? There's a cabinet.

376
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:40,090
It costs three rock star gold to open, yeah.

377
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:42,259
Once purchased, looted,

378
00:15:42,259 --> 00:15:44,259
or crafted consumables. It's so dark over here.

379
00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:47,269
Oh, I got a guy.

380
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:49,899
There's a guy in there.

381
00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:51,899
Where'd you get that guy from?

382
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:55,539
He was in the cabinet.

383
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:57,539
I guess we just get to take this guy.

384
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,539
Maybe we can sell him somewhere?

385
00:15:59,539 --> 00:16:02,100
Pretty sure we can do that.

386
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,100
Let's do that.

387
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,100
I dropped him in the water and

388
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,100
you have to bring him to the iPhone store.

389
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,100
The water damage is like

390
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,100
you just can't fucking recover it.

391
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,100
I just got disconnected.

392
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,919
And just like that

393
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:18,919
you're gone.

394
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:20,919
Did you get DC'd?

395
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:22,919
I don't know if I got DC'd

396
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:24,919
but I can't loot anybody right now.

397
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:26,919
The cycle never ends.

398
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:29,419
You would think

399
00:16:29,419 --> 00:16:31,419
Vegas would have good internet.

400
00:16:31,419 --> 00:16:33,419
I got

401
00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:35,419
a greater internet at the moment.

402
00:16:35,419 --> 00:16:37,419
For some reason my connection to rock star

403
00:16:37,419 --> 00:16:42,279
I don't know why.

404
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:47,059
This is what was happening to me before too.

405
00:16:47,059 --> 00:16:49,059
Are you still in the game?

406
00:16:49,059 --> 00:16:51,059
I'm still in game.

407
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:53,500
Let me know when you're back online.

408
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:58,100
I can invite you.

409
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,100
What the...

410
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,409
Can I swear?

411
00:17:02,409 --> 00:17:04,410
I swear a little.

412
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:07,670
Shit.

413
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,670
What the shit?

414
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:12,940
I'm sorry.

415
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,940
By rights we shouldn't even be friends.

416
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,940
I'm a New York Yankees guy.

417
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,940
What?

418
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,940
What?

419
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:24,200
I can't believe you

420
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,200
just fucking said that.

421
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,910
The truth is though

422
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,910
I don't really care.

423
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,910
I was told I was a Yankees fan when I was a child.

424
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:35,910
I was told

425
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,910
I was a Yankees fan.

426
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,910
I was told that I was.

427
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,910
You know

428
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,910
watched a couple games here and there.

429
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:46,339
I'm supposed to be angry at you

430
00:17:46,339 --> 00:17:48,339
according to the laws of thermodynamics.

431
00:17:48,339 --> 00:17:50,779
I mean that's

432
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:53,980
okay.

433
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,980
Being a Yankee fan

434
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,980
obviously

435
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,980
there's something wrong with you.

436
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,980
Right, of course there is.

437
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,980
If you go to the doctor

438
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,980
and you tell the doctor

439
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,980
when they do a physical exam

440
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,980
one of the first things they have to ask you is

441
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,980
still a baseball fan?

442
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,980
Yeah, yeah I am.

443
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,980
Yankees? Red Sox? Which one?

444
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,980
Because it's very important.

445
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,980
You get a CT scan for that.

446
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,220
They have to check your whole body

447
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,220
and make sure it's not like an ulcer

448
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,220
or something. That could be what's causing it.

449
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,220
I think

450
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,220
it's the Lumbego again though.

451
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:33,029
Pretty sure.

452
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:35,029
What is Lumbego?

453
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:37,029
So the uncle character in this game

454
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:39,029
says that he has a killer case of Lumbego

455
00:18:39,029 --> 00:18:41,029
and apparently what that is

456
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:43,029
is just his lower back hurts.

457
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:45,029
So it's his lower back pain.

458
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:47,029
I like to blame a lot of my failings

459
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:49,029
on Lumbego these days.

460
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:51,029
Am I in your game?

461
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:53,029
I might even just be in your game.

462
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:56,099
Am I in here?

463
00:18:56,099 --> 00:18:58,099
Am I with you?

464
00:18:58,099 --> 00:19:00,099
No, I'm sending you another invite.

465
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:02,099
Doesn't look like you're in here.

466
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,099
Oh god, this guy is going to kill me.

467
00:19:04,099 --> 00:19:06,339
I hope I can portal out of here.

468
00:19:06,339 --> 00:19:08,339
Lethal hog. Processing invite.

469
00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:10,339
Okay, thank god.

470
00:19:10,339 --> 00:19:12,650
This guy in his whole posse

471
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:14,650
was medicinally walking around me

472
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:16,650
with their guns out.

473
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:20,869
Just portal to it out of the way.

474
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:23,240
Were they ghosts?

475
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,240
No, they were just bandits.

476
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,240
Okay, because I think that might be

477
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,240
a glimpse at the DLC.

478
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,240
Ghost cowboys. We had zombies in the

479
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,240
previous game and it'll just be ghosts this time around.

480
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,240
I wonder what their plan is.

481
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,240
Do they have no plan at all?

482
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,420
Think?

483
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,420
Yeah, they have a plan. The plan is to continue

484
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,420
implementing weapons and cosmetic items

485
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,420
and selling gold bars

486
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,420
that you can then buy them with.

487
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,420
Did you know that

488
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,420
one of the dudes at Rockstar

489
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,420
or was it Take Two or something

490
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,420
said that they didn't feel GTA Online was monetized

491
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,420
enough? Wait, is that for real?

492
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,420
Yeah, apparently. Somebody actually said that?

493
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,420
Yeah.

494
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:06,200
And I like Rockstar.

495
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,200
And they're really good to me. And I think

496
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,200
that that's ridiculous. That was a highly

497
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,200
monetized game. What the?

498
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,140
I think I'm in your game.

499
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,140
But I don't think I'm in your posse. Is this you up here?

500
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,140
Hold on. I don't know. Let me just

501
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,140
make sure.

502
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,640
Strauss said that. There you go.

503
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,069
Yeah.

504
00:20:26,069 --> 00:20:28,069
Yeah, I'm right next to you. Telling that there's a character

505
00:20:28,069 --> 00:20:30,069
that is a loan shark in this game

506
00:20:30,069 --> 00:20:32,069
called Strauss.

507
00:20:32,069 --> 00:20:37,299
Just want to make sure he was dead.

508
00:20:37,299 --> 00:20:39,299
Hey.

509
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:41,299
Thank you.

510
00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:43,299
Wasn't there

511
00:20:43,299 --> 00:20:45,299
an Activision

512
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:47,299
executive that said they wished they

513
00:20:47,299 --> 00:20:49,299
could sell a controller that was like $150

514
00:20:49,299 --> 00:20:51,299
or if they

515
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:53,299
could sell their games for like double, they would do it

516
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:55,299
if they could get away with it or something.

517
00:20:55,299 --> 00:20:57,299
I think so. Yeah, I seem to remember.

518
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:59,299
I don't know for sure, but that sounds familiar.

519
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,299
That was a couple years ago, no? Yeah.

520
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:03,299
Something ridiculous like that.

521
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:05,539
It's just it's a gift

522
00:21:05,539 --> 00:21:07,539
that keeps on giving. It really is.

523
00:21:07,539 --> 00:21:09,539
All right.

524
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:11,539
I'm trying to join your posse.

525
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:13,539
I got you the invite now.

526
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:17,059
There's someone mad at me.

527
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:19,059
So if someone appears over the ridge and tries to shoot

528
00:21:19,059 --> 00:21:21,059
us, then

529
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:23,059
that's my fault.

530
00:21:23,059 --> 00:21:25,059
All right. So where's this free horse?

531
00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:27,059
Is that your horse?

532
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:29,059
Yeah, it is. I guess it is now.

533
00:21:29,059 --> 00:21:31,059
I guess it is yours now.

534
00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:33,059
So Valentine,

535
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:35,059
I'll set a waypoint. Set a waypoint for us.

536
00:21:35,059 --> 00:21:37,059
And by the way, there

537
00:21:37,059 --> 00:21:39,059
is- Wait, wait. Valentine chat?

538
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:43,609
Oh, okay.

539
00:21:43,609 --> 00:21:45,609
There's like a 90 to 95 percent

540
00:21:45,609 --> 00:21:47,609
chance that I'm going to dump us.

541
00:21:47,609 --> 00:21:49,609
What's that?

542
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:51,609
Is that the guy that was trying to fight you?

543
00:21:51,609 --> 00:21:54,920
That's my horse.

544
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,920
Why was it just angry? It just had like a

545
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,920
blip on the screen. Really?

546
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,920
Yeah, it was a red blip. No, I don't

547
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,220
know. That was weird.

548
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,980
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

549
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,980
Watch this, they're going to go

550
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:11,619
bowling. They're fast

551
00:22:11,619 --> 00:22:13,619
though. These horses are real fucking

552
00:22:13,619 --> 00:22:17,400
shitty. These pins.

553
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,400
So Jeremy, are you going to Pax East

554
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,400
this year, even though you now live halfway across

555
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,400
the country? More than halfway.

556
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,400
I am not.

557
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,400
Not going to Pax East this year.

558
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,400
Unfortunately. I had to

559
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,400
check. I just wanted to know. Are you chasing after

560
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,400
this guy? No, I'm just

561
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,400
trying to head to Valentine.

562
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,769
Yeah, not this year.

563
00:22:37,769 --> 00:22:40,460
Vinny, are you going to Pax East?

564
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,460
I will be there in body

565
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:45,079
but not in spirit.

566
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:47,509
So no.

567
00:22:47,509 --> 00:22:50,009
Because your spirit

568
00:22:50,009 --> 00:22:52,009
is what controls the body. The body is just a

569
00:22:52,009 --> 00:22:54,009
big case.

570
00:22:54,009 --> 00:22:56,009
Yeah, it's like

571
00:22:56,009 --> 00:22:58,009
a meat machine.

572
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:00,009
So you're sending your horse hair cooler master

573
00:23:00,009 --> 00:23:02,009
to Pax.

574
00:23:02,009 --> 00:23:04,009
That's correct.

575
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:06,250
I need a new keyboard for this

576
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,250
fucking game.

577
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,250
And I need some more memory because, man, I am

578
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,250
running out.

579
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,250
I've got to learn how to laugh without being a disgusting

580
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,490
human being.

581
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:18,490
Me just laughing right there.

582
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:20,490
What was my horse doing?

583
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:22,490
What the fuck?

584
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:25,049
He just ran over my

585
00:23:25,049 --> 00:23:30,619
head.

586
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:32,619
That was good. Keep it up.

587
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,619
I need to feed him.

588
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:36,980
Oh, carrots.

589
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,980
Where's the horse food? Oh, that's right.

590
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,980
I can feed him my clothes.

591
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,980
I barely have anything to feed this fucking

592
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:52,779
thing.

593
00:23:52,779 --> 00:23:54,779
Are you trying to shoot that guy? Yeah, I tried.

594
00:23:54,779 --> 00:23:57,210
But yeah, what I'm saying is

595
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:59,210
people must hate

596
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:01,210
talking to me. Okay, so let me ask

597
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:03,210
you something. We like hung out.

598
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:05,210
We hung out in person.

599
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,210
In person.

600
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:09,210
When I like laughed at something, did I just

601
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:11,210
like sprinkle or spit in

602
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:13,210
your face? No. Okay.

603
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:15,210
I don't know what it is about sitting here, but every time I laugh, I just like

604
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:17,210
droplets of water just all over my

605
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:19,210
screen. I'm not even sipping anything.

606
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:21,210
I don't understand how.

607
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,210
You know, I have a weird

608
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:25,210
confession to make. Okay.

609
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:27,210
So my Wii U gamepad, the screen

610
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:29,210
is like

611
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:31,210
is kind of gross. That's like

612
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:33,210
four years of streaming it and speaking

613
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:35,210
in front of it. And I thought I didn't

614
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:37,210
spit when I spoke or laugh.

615
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:39,210
I was clearly extremely

616
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:41,210
mistaken. So I think this is just being

617
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:43,210
a human. This is just faulty hardware.

618
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:45,210
Something that we all share.

619
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:47,210
No, I think you're honest in there because

620
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:49,210
it's gonna happen again. Don't you do it.

621
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:51,210
Okay, we're fine. This horse

622
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:53,210
sucks. I'd rather just ride on yours.

623
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,450
You can if you want. My

624
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:59,450
oatmeal is a sturdy horse

625
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:01,450
firm, I guess. But also the

626
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:03,450
frame rates are dipping. Are you getting like weird frame rates?

627
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:05,450
Oh yeah, it's bad. It's like

628
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:07,450
20 frames a second. Yeah, what's

629
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:09,450
going on? I feel like I'm playing Ocarina of Time again.

630
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:11,450
Uh, but I think

631
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:13,450
that's just like a hill. Let me like transfer.

632
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:16,069
Let me transfer.

633
00:25:16,069 --> 00:25:18,069
I think that's just a

634
00:25:18,069 --> 00:25:20,569
almost a tree.

635
00:25:20,569 --> 00:25:22,569
Just hang on a minute, okay? Yeah. Where's your horse?

636
00:25:22,569 --> 00:25:26,279
Take care of it.

637
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:28,279
Wait, you're killing him. You just killed my horse?

638
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:30,279
No, no, I

639
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:32,279
wouldn't let me. We're friends.

640
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:34,279
Tidge wouldn't let me. Yeah,

641
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:36,710
I tried.

642
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:38,710
But you haven't noticed that, I don't know, do you have like an iPad

643
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:40,710
or anything? I don't have

644
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:43,019
any, um, no.

645
00:25:43,019 --> 00:25:45,019
Even like the Switch or the Wii U,

646
00:25:45,019 --> 00:25:47,019
you're right there, but for some

647
00:25:47,019 --> 00:25:49,019
reason, it's the most embarrassing thing in the world.

648
00:25:49,019 --> 00:25:51,019
Even your phone too. If somebody

649
00:25:51,019 --> 00:25:53,019
ever is like, hey, can I use your phone?

650
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:55,019
It's just like, oh fuck, and you look at it and

651
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:57,019
it's just like, oh, and I was like, I was like shitting and like

652
00:25:57,019 --> 00:25:59,019
using this. I gotta like wipe it off. I gotta like

653
00:25:59,019 --> 00:26:01,019
pissing and

654
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:03,019
There's particles.

655
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:05,019
There's particles, whether you want there to be or not,

656
00:26:05,019 --> 00:26:07,019
there's particles. And nobody wants, nobody

657
00:26:07,019 --> 00:26:09,019
wants you to, if there's a screen involved,

658
00:26:09,019 --> 00:26:11,019
you never want

659
00:26:11,019 --> 00:26:13,019
someone to touch it or look at it.

660
00:26:13,019 --> 00:26:15,900
Anytime somebody wants to, oh, can I use your iPad

661
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,650
for a second? Well, that person didn't

662
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:20,650
let us use their iPad.

663
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:26,410
Fuck. Maybe there are horses

664
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:28,410
better. I can't steal it.

665
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:32,950
We can't take it?

666
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:34,950
Oh, hey.

667
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:37,829
Calm it down,

668
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:39,829
calm down, calm down, calm down.

669
00:26:39,829 --> 00:26:41,829
Alright, let's get out of here before they get mad at us.

670
00:26:41,829 --> 00:26:43,829
No, no, I'm talking about the horse. I calmed the horse down. This thing is cool.

671
00:26:43,829 --> 00:26:46,140
We need to take this thing.

672
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,140
I don't think we can. I think it's, it's got a

673
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,140
saddle on it. That thing tried to kick you

674
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:54,680
by the way.

675
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:58,579
Well, that person's head is still bleeding.

676
00:26:58,579 --> 00:27:02,299
I can't wait to get our cool, oh, there they are,

677
00:27:02,299 --> 00:27:05,180
they're there. Alright,

678
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,180
line it up. I'm jumping to the horse.

679
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:12,180
Not even necessary.

680
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,490
Nope, none of this

681
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:16,490
is necessary. I told you, I'm not a good guy.

682
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:18,490
I am morally as

683
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:20,490
gray as you can get. This is your, this is

684
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:22,490
good guy, right?

685
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:24,660
I'm a good guy, yeah. No, that's what,

686
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,660
good, we,

687
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,900
what's bad about it?

688
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,900
They are bad. We're killing the bad guys.

689
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:35,130
That's what I'm saying. So,

690
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:37,130
oh, oh, oh, here, in regards to the

691
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:39,130
discussion that we just had about touchscreens,

692
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:41,130
did you know that they did,

693
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:43,130
I don't know who they is,

694
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:45,130
but they did some tests

695
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:47,130
on McDonald's touchscreens

696
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:49,130
for ordering, and they determined that

697
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:51,130
there is poo on every one of the ones

698
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:53,130
that they tested. Oh,

699
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,130
that's, that's fucking

700
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:57,130
disgusting.

701
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:59,369
Nice jump, by the way.

702
00:27:59,369 --> 00:28:02,630
Yeah. I'm

703
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:04,630
sorry, man, but I'm of the opinion, that doesn't really

704
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:06,630
gross me out because I feel like there's poo

705
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:08,630
everywhere. Yeah, there is poo

706
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,630
everywhere. As Bruce Willis once said, there's always

707
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:12,630
a little shit in the meat. I mean, like

708
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:14,630
there's probably, there's probably shit on your hands

709
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:16,630
right now. Yeah.

710
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:18,630
No, I wouldn't be surprised. I mean, you know, little

711
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,630
microbes.

712
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:22,630
I mean, if you test the oxygen around you, it's

713
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:24,630
probably like point one percent poo.

714
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:26,630
And you just look down and it's like, oh my

715
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:28,630
god. My hands

716
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:30,630
are covered in shit. I look

717
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:32,630
down and my controller is just filled

718
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:35,319
with turds.

719
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:37,500
That would be disgusting. I'm getting

720
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,500
someone just said, Vinnie, I'm getting sick.

721
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,500
I'm sorry, chat member. You didn't deserve that.

722
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,740
How much vomit

723
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,740
particulates do you believe are floating

724
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:47,740
around at any given moment? Well,

725
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,740
to be, I'll be completely honest, at least

726
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,740
a few dozen here because I, when you said you were a

727
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,740
Yankees fan, I threw up into my glass. So

728
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,740
Oh, good point. That did happen.

729
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,740
How did you feel about

730
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,740
I mean, are you, I don't know, I don't remember

731
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,740
if we talked about this when we were in Boston, but are

732
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,740
you a big enough baseball fan to have really felt

733
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,740
like a dopamine hit when

734
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,740
they won? Um, no.

735
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,740
Because I took the ultimate

736
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:13,000
drug in 2004. Jesus.

737
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Jesus.

738
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I found Jesus.

739
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Oh, no, really?

740
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
What did you hit?

741
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
When the Red Sox won the World Series for the first

742
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
time in like a hundred years. Oh, okay.

743
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
That was 2004 was like the magical

744
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
year and no other drug could ever

745
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
come close.

746
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
2007 was pretty good too because

747
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
one of my favorite players was on the

748
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
World Series with 2007 and

749
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
you know, that team

750
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I think was a really great team. But then

751
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
2013, it was like, oh, okay.

752
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Man, this is

753
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Red Sox are so good this third time

754
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
in like less than 10 years.

755
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
And then this last one, it's like the best team they've ever

756
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
had in history of the history of the entire

757
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
franchise. And it's like, yeah.

758
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Man, I wish I could get that 2004

759
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
drug bill.

760
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Right, right. It just gets less. It's like

761
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
when the Yankees won a bunch in

762
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
a row in the

763
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
late 90s and it was just getting boring.

764
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
And then when they didn't win, it was like, well, fuck, I wanted a day

765
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
off from school.

766
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
It wasn't even like special anymore. It was just

767
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
where's my day off? Because they were giving us a day off when the Yankees

768
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
won. Really?

769
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Yeah, they did. For the parade.

770
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
You could choose not to go and they wouldn't be upset.

771
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Wow.

772
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Uh huh. So where's our free horse?

773
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,240
Um, hey chat.

774
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,940
Was that a jape?

775
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,500
Did you guys, uh...

776
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,799
Were you just joking with us the whole time, huh?

777
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:37,799
No. The free horse is in strawberry.

778
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:41,059
Jeremy, I have a

779
00:30:41,059 --> 00:30:43,299
I have a confession. What is it?

780
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:45,299
I took us to the wrong town. Oh.

781
00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:47,859
It's okay.

782
00:30:47,859 --> 00:30:49,859
Because I go to the wrong town literally

783
00:30:49,859 --> 00:30:51,859
every time I play the game. So.

784
00:30:51,859 --> 00:30:54,680
Okay. Um, we have to go to strawberry.

785
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,750
Wait, wait, can we take a, um,

786
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,750
take a fast travel? I think it costs money.

787
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:02,869
What's this horse? Did I get a...

788
00:31:02,869 --> 00:31:04,869
Oh, this is the horse that I got from... Okay, yeah.

789
00:31:04,869 --> 00:31:07,430
So this is my actual horse.

790
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:09,430
There's one with the frame rates in multiplayer.

791
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:11,430
Jesus. Yeah, they're pretty bad.

792
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:14,700
Um, I'm gonna

793
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,700
attempt to do the stagecoach and see how long that takes.

794
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,700
And how much money

795
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,700
it costs to fast travel. Oh, yeah, yeah.

796
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,259
That's probably a good idea.

797
00:31:23,259 --> 00:31:25,259
It's under buy horses superior.

798
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:27,259
But it's only in strawberry. Only in

799
00:31:27,259 --> 00:31:31,609
strawberry. How far away is that from here?

800
00:31:31,609 --> 00:31:33,609
That's not that far. It's not too bad.

801
00:31:33,609 --> 00:31:35,609
It's not terrible. Vinny, no. Hang on.

802
00:31:35,609 --> 00:31:37,609
Wait, wait, wait. Only strawberry.

803
00:31:37,609 --> 00:31:39,609
No. In any stables. Only strawberry.

804
00:31:39,609 --> 00:31:41,609
Any stable. Only

805
00:31:41,609 --> 00:31:43,609
strawberry. I hate life sometimes.

806
00:31:43,609 --> 00:31:45,609
Okay, I'm gonna go back to this and I'm gonna let you know.

807
00:31:45,609 --> 00:31:47,609
Eat the raspberries, Vinny.

808
00:31:47,609 --> 00:31:49,609
That's what they say.

809
00:31:49,609 --> 00:31:51,609
Eat those raspberries. Don't eat them.

810
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:53,609
They're not poisonous. Those raspberries

811
00:31:53,609 --> 00:31:55,609
in front of you are not poisonous. Yes, they are.

812
00:31:55,609 --> 00:31:57,609
They're poisonous. Like,

813
00:31:57,609 --> 00:31:59,609
I've talked about this on my stream before, but let me

814
00:31:59,609 --> 00:32:01,609
see how you feel about this.

815
00:32:01,609 --> 00:32:03,609
If you were in a room and

816
00:32:03,609 --> 00:32:05,609
there were a hundred people

817
00:32:05,609 --> 00:32:07,609
outside, like we're talking like a two-way

818
00:32:07,609 --> 00:32:09,609
mirror, like glass, right? You're sitting in like

819
00:32:09,609 --> 00:32:12,099
a interrogation room.

820
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:14,099
And a guy comes in and puts

821
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:16,099
berries down in front of you.

822
00:32:16,099 --> 00:32:18,099
They're like

823
00:32:18,099 --> 00:32:20,099
red. Just red berries on the little

824
00:32:20,099 --> 00:32:22,859
plate and he leaves the room. Are you going to eat

825
00:32:22,859 --> 00:32:24,859
them if you hear fifty

826
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:26,859
percent of the people screaming, don't eat those.

827
00:32:26,859 --> 00:32:28,859
They're poisonous from the other room.

828
00:32:28,859 --> 00:32:30,859
Or eat them. They'll give you superpowers. Don't listen

829
00:32:30,859 --> 00:32:35,910
to them. What are you gonna do? Are you gonna eat them?

830
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:37,910
How depressed am I before I enter this room?

831
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:39,910
Today was a great day.

832
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:42,660
Like, today was a fantastic day.

833
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,029
One of the best you probably had all week.

834
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:50,009
Did Smash come out yet?

835
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:52,009
Yeah, Smash came out.

836
00:32:52,009 --> 00:32:54,009
And Gino got confirmed for DLC.

837
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:02,839
Okay, I won't eat the berries then. You won't eat them?

838
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:04,839
Alright. No. Alright, so when you push that

839
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:06,839
away, half of the people in the other room

840
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:08,839
are screaming at you.

841
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:11,720
And they're very upset with you. And like your

842
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,720
day gets worse because as you're walking out

843
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,720
there's like drinks are getting thrown at you.

844
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,019
There's like fruits that are flying by your head.

845
00:33:18,019 --> 00:33:20,019
Like, you should have eaten yours, you fucking idiot.

846
00:33:20,019 --> 00:33:22,019
And like somebody drives by and throws like a large soda at you.

847
00:33:22,019 --> 00:33:27,400
God, this is tough. What would

848
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,150
you do?

849
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:32,150
I wouldn't do it. No, I don't think so.

850
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:35,609
I mean, super powers sound cool

851
00:33:35,609 --> 00:33:37,609
and everything, but isn't God much

852
00:33:37,609 --> 00:33:39,609
more cooler?

853
00:33:39,609 --> 00:33:41,609
Alright, I'm gonna sell oatmeal. Goodbye oatmeal.

854
00:33:41,609 --> 00:33:43,609
Why are you selling your

855
00:33:43,609 --> 00:33:45,609
horse? I liked oatmeal because

856
00:33:45,609 --> 00:33:47,609
it was a cool name, but someone else can have oatmeal.

857
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:49,609
There's a free horse in here, dude. There's a free horse in there?

858
00:33:49,609 --> 00:33:51,609
Yeah, there's a free horse.

859
00:33:51,609 --> 00:33:55,000
Did you just like ram

860
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
into the fucking stables at full speed?

861
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Because I saw that on the

862
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
cutscene.

863
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Alright, go to buy horse,

864
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
go to superior at the bottom,

865
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Arabian, red chestnut,

866
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,880
and you can claim a free

867
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,179
horse. Your stable is full?

868
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:14,179
Yeah, you gotta sell your other horse.

869
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:16,489
How much did you get for selling that one?

870
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:18,489
Next to nothing.

871
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:20,920
My horse's name is Sean.

872
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:25,579
Alright, sorry.

873
00:34:25,579 --> 00:34:27,579
Someone said name it Bagel.

874
00:34:27,579 --> 00:34:31,269
Name it Nut. Oh, that's a good

875
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:33,269
idea. I'll name it Nut. People are gonna be so upset

876
00:34:33,269 --> 00:34:35,829
I'm about to sell this horse.

877
00:34:35,829 --> 00:34:37,829
Yeah, my audience was not happy.

878
00:34:37,829 --> 00:34:40,780
Oh, by the way,

879
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,780
why don't we do a quick plug? I want to plug your

880
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,780
stream. If anyone wants to see what's going on, or

881
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,780
do like a multi-stream and watch Jerma

882
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,949
stream too, you can go to Twitch.tv

883
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:51,449
slash Jerma.

884
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:55,750
That's good enough.

885
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:57,750
They'll find me. Sure. Twitch.tv

886
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:00,380
slash Jerma. Yeah, it's

887
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:02,380
J-H-E-R-R-H-H-H.

888
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,739
Twitch.tv slash.

889
00:35:04,739 --> 00:35:06,739
Because there's numbers, right? At the end.

890
00:35:06,739 --> 00:35:08,739
Yeah, I'm one of those idiots that has numbers.

891
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:11,750
Jerma985, J-H-E-R-M-A-985.

892
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:13,750
And if anybody over here that wants to go check out

893
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:17,019
Vinnie. Yeah, you

894
00:35:17,019 --> 00:35:19,019
could go to Twitch.tv

895
00:35:19,019 --> 00:35:21,019
slash. Yeah.

896
00:35:21,019 --> 00:35:23,019
This is like four H's.

897
00:35:23,019 --> 00:35:26,599
Vine. Vine

898
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:29,739
sauce. That is correct.

899
00:35:29,739 --> 00:35:32,360
You know, multi-stream us.

900
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,539
You know what I'm saying? Yeah, there's

901
00:35:34,539 --> 00:35:36,539
gonna be a way to do that natively

902
00:35:36,539 --> 00:35:38,539
soon enough, like Twitch is implemented

903
00:35:38,539 --> 00:35:40,539
or they're working on implementing a way to do that.

904
00:35:40,539 --> 00:35:43,289
So that way

905
00:35:43,289 --> 00:35:45,780
you can just enjoy other

906
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,780
streamers without having to go to like a multi-stream website.

907
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:50,090
So I think that's kind of cool.

908
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:52,090
Yeah. That's kind of, that's very

909
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:55,030
necessary. Yeah. I think it's

910
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:57,590
a great idea. I'm surprised it hasn't happened sooner.

911
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:01,619
There we go. Alright, so I got my free

912
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:04,889
horse. Thank God. There's

913
00:36:04,889 --> 00:36:06,889
a couple free saddles available.

914
00:36:06,889 --> 00:36:09,260
Yeah. I'm looking

915
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,260
at some of the stuff right now. 80

916
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,750
bucks. How are you ever gonna get like

917
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:15,750
more than five gold bars in this game?

918
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,750
How is that impossible?

919
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,750
Oh, I know how it's possible.

920
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,750
There was a big drama post about how

921
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:25,750
someone was like, they did the math and to earn

922
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,750
enough money to buy another

923
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,750
stable or like, you know, a horse.

924
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:31,929
A good horse. They said it was something

925
00:36:31,929 --> 00:36:33,929
like 80 hours.

926
00:36:33,929 --> 00:36:35,929
And then that was disproven. I mean, they got the

927
00:36:35,929 --> 00:36:37,929
math wrong and it was like seven hours instead.

928
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:40,170
Oh, I don't want to

929
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:42,170
cause you any alarm here.

930
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:44,469
But horse insurance

931
00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:46,469
for this horse is five gold bars

932
00:36:46,469 --> 00:36:49,099
that I don't have. Found out that the

933
00:36:49,099 --> 00:36:51,099
horses come back no matter what. The insurance

934
00:36:51,099 --> 00:36:53,099
just makes them more healthy. Oh,

935
00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:56,489
okay. So you can't

936
00:36:56,489 --> 00:36:58,489
if you have an owned horse and multiplayer,

937
00:36:58,489 --> 00:37:01,739
you're good. Okay, that's good.

938
00:37:01,739 --> 00:37:05,130
But yeah, you definitely

939
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:07,130
want to get another saddle because

940
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:09,820
there's some really good ones.

941
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,820
So what you do is go to empty slot,

942
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,820
attack one of them, and then

943
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,820
special. Oh, you got it? Yeah, I got one.

944
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:19,590
Okay, cool. I don't know why these are free.

945
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:21,900
Are these all for free?

946
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:25,289
I mean, I can't buy them though. Some of them.

947
00:37:25,289 --> 00:37:27,289
Oh, some of them. Did you get the couple

948
00:37:27,289 --> 00:37:30,099
free ones or? This one's 39.

949
00:37:30,099 --> 00:37:32,469
Which one is the free one? This one's 67.

950
00:37:32,469 --> 00:37:34,710
It should just be 00.

951
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,909
Oh, I doubt it's special. Okay, I see.

952
00:37:37,909 --> 00:37:40,280
Alligator Ranch. Yeah, I'll get this one.

953
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,739
The very last one at the end is really

954
00:37:43,739 --> 00:37:49,219
good. Let's see. Rattlesnake.

955
00:37:49,219 --> 00:37:53,050
Some of them are pretty cool. Oh,

956
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:55,050
quick recommendation while we're here.

957
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:57,050
I'd recommend getting some provisions

958
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:59,050
for your horse so they can eat and not die.

959
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:01,289
Oh, that's a good idea.

960
00:38:01,289 --> 00:38:03,289
Yeah, and maybe a horse reviver too.

961
00:38:03,289 --> 00:38:06,599
A little expensive, but it's probably

962
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:10,630
worth it. So it's services, right?

963
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:12,630
Well, not services. Under

964
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:15,769
provisions. How much is it? Yeah.

965
00:38:15,769 --> 00:38:17,769
That's a lot of money. Well, the horse reviver's a lot

966
00:38:17,769 --> 00:38:19,769
of money, but the hay is a quarter,

967
00:38:19,769 --> 00:38:22,900
so that's not too bad, and it's... I'm just gonna buy

968
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,079
shit right now. Hey, what about a sugar

969
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:27,769
cube? You gonna get a couple of those? I'm gonna

970
00:38:27,769 --> 00:38:29,769
get some beets from Shroot Farms, but

971
00:38:29,769 --> 00:38:31,769
yeah, I'm gonna get some sugar cube. I got a horse

972
00:38:31,769 --> 00:38:35,860
reviver, I got some food. You know, by doing this,

973
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,860
we're never gonna afford new weapons.

974
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:40,980
Never. I've come to

975
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,480
terms with the fact that it's just gonna be

976
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,980
I'm gonna use the pea shooter with the BB gun.

977
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:48,409
Yeah. Me too.

978
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:52,380
Should we get our horses? Sorry, I had some

979
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,619
peanut butter. Like a horse would.

980
00:38:54,619 --> 00:38:56,980
That's what they used to feed Mr.

981
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,980
Ed to make it look like he was talking.

982
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:01,860
The way you said

983
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,860
that too, like the way your voice managed to squeak

984
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,860
out that sentence, it sounded like Mr. Ed a little bit

985
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,860
gush-poo-poo.

986
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:12,539
So, good job.

987
00:39:12,539 --> 00:39:15,539
I didn't even... That show sucks!

988
00:39:15,539 --> 00:39:18,360
Yeah, I hated Mr. Ed.

989
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,860
That horse scared the fuck out of me.

990
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:24,380
Why does it talk? I don't like it.

991
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:28,090
Why didn't anybody try to breed it?

992
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:30,090
You could have a bunch of... You could start an entire

993
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:32,090
new horse...

994
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:34,519
Sub-species. Yeah.

995
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:36,519
We could have intelligent horses

996
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:38,820
all talking. Sell them.

997
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:41,260
They would be so happy. We could...

998
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,260
Horses that just love to sit around and eat hay, right?

999
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,429
Yeah. That's all they do.

1000
00:39:45,429 --> 00:39:47,429
Just put a headset on, yeah.

1001
00:39:47,429 --> 00:39:49,800
Put a headset on them and they could be like

1002
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:53,320
telemarketers while they're just hanging out.

1003
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,320
Where are we going? That's right!

1004
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,559
You give them jobs again. Like, because they don't have

1005
00:39:57,559 --> 00:39:59,559
as many jobs these days like they used to back in the

1006
00:39:59,559 --> 00:40:01,559
old west and, you know, before that, of course.

1007
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:03,559
But I think, yeah, make them telemarketers.

1008
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:05,559
Hello! How can I help you?

1009
00:40:05,559 --> 00:40:07,929
They would be so happy.

1010
00:40:07,929 --> 00:40:09,929
They would get paid. They would get paid.

1011
00:40:09,929 --> 00:40:12,679
Of course we would pay them. Of course.

1012
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:14,679
Fucking horse cars. Of course.

1013
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:18,059
Where are we going? I don't know.

1014
00:40:18,059 --> 00:40:20,059
Do you want to kill some things?

1015
00:40:20,059 --> 00:40:22,420
Yeah, let's go...

1016
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,420
In the context of this video game, yes.

1017
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:27,050
It's out of context.

1018
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:29,289
Hey, you want to go kill some stuff? Yeah!

1019
00:40:29,289 --> 00:40:32,420
Yeah, we don't want to do that.

1020
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:34,420
I want to go run over some rabbits.

1021
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:39,800
I can start up a quick join

1022
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,099
and we can do a mission.

1023
00:40:42,099 --> 00:40:44,099
We can do a story mission or we can do like a

1024
00:40:44,099 --> 00:40:46,789
showdown mission.

1025
00:40:46,789 --> 00:40:48,789
Let's do a showdown mission.

1026
00:40:48,789 --> 00:40:54,039
Why not?

1027
00:40:54,039 --> 00:40:56,039
Showdown series. You'll also join as a member of their posse.

1028
00:40:56,039 --> 00:41:11,829
Okay, cool. It looks like we're going.

1029
00:41:11,829 --> 00:41:13,829
So how's the weather over there, man?

1030
00:41:13,829 --> 00:41:16,329
It's beautiful. Do you miss Boston weather?

1031
00:41:16,329 --> 00:41:19,340
Not at all.

1032
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:21,340
This is snow season here

1033
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,340
for Boston, so

1034
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,340
I am absolutely ecstatic that

1035
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:27,340
it's like 50 degrees

1036
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,340
every day. It drops down overnight

1037
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,340
because it's obviously the desert, so it drops down to like

1038
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:33,340
low 40s.

1039
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:35,340
So it gets cold, but

1040
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:37,340
the days are great.

1041
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:40,789
He's literally talking about

1042
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:42,789
the weather.

1043
00:41:42,789 --> 00:41:44,789
Oh god, I just got booted.

1044
00:41:44,789 --> 00:41:46,789
Wait, you got booted?

1045
00:41:46,789 --> 00:41:48,789
Really? Yeah.

1046
00:41:48,789 --> 00:41:50,789
Oh, okay. Why does this game

1047
00:41:50,789 --> 00:41:52,789
hate me so much?

1048
00:41:52,789 --> 00:41:56,059
I'll just quit out.

1049
00:41:56,059 --> 00:41:58,059
I don't know why this game hates me so much.

1050
00:41:58,059 --> 00:42:03,239
What's wrong with the weather?

1051
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:05,239
I'll just say this. Lately it's been pretty cold

1052
00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:08,760
here, but

1053
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,059
considered at times in my life

1054
00:42:11,059 --> 00:42:13,059
moving to a place where I don't

1055
00:42:13,059 --> 00:42:15,059
have to deal with like

1056
00:42:15,059 --> 00:42:17,690
bone chill.

1057
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:19,690
The one thing that I will say

1058
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:21,690
is going to the west coast

1059
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:24,489
is, I mean

1060
00:42:24,489 --> 00:42:26,489
there are pros and cons everywhere. I mean I miss Boston

1061
00:42:26,489 --> 00:42:28,489
all the time. Yeah.

1062
00:42:28,489 --> 00:42:30,489
But you miss bagels. Yeah.

1063
00:42:30,489 --> 00:42:32,489
You bet your ass I do.

1064
00:42:32,489 --> 00:42:35,559
I miss the bagels. I miss the

1065
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:37,559
sub sandwiches, like the steak and cheese subs.

1066
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:39,989
I miss those.

1067
00:42:39,989 --> 00:42:42,360
Yeah. I would miss those too.

1068
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:45,050
I miss the pizza. Ah, that's

1069
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:47,050
right. Do you find any good pizza?

1070
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:49,219
Yeah, I mean there's some decent pizza places

1071
00:42:49,219 --> 00:42:51,219
out here, but not like there are in New York

1072
00:42:51,219 --> 00:42:55,829
obviously. Okay, I'm

1073
00:42:55,829 --> 00:42:57,829
going to try to invite you again. Yeah,

1074
00:42:57,829 --> 00:42:59,829
I don't know why

1075
00:42:59,829 --> 00:43:01,829
because

1076
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,829
every time it kicks me out it says, there's a problem

1077
00:43:03,829 --> 00:43:05,829
with the Rockstar servers. It doesn't

1078
00:43:05,829 --> 00:43:07,829
like say, you've been disconnected because your computer

1079
00:43:07,829 --> 00:43:09,829
sucks. It's, you've been

1080
00:43:09,829 --> 00:43:11,829
disconnected but our servers are a problem.

1081
00:43:11,829 --> 00:43:13,829
That's like what the error code is. At least

1082
00:43:13,829 --> 00:43:17,099
they're honest about it. I don't know

1083
00:43:17,099 --> 00:43:19,099
though, I feel like, I don't

1084
00:43:19,099 --> 00:43:21,099
know who this is. Who the fuck is this?

1085
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:27,369
I think I just,

1086
00:43:27,369 --> 00:43:31,849
all right. All right.

1087
00:43:31,849 --> 00:43:36,199
I'm ready for an invite.

1088
00:43:36,199 --> 00:43:38,199
Here it is. Hey, coming

1089
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:40,199
to you. Hey.

1090
00:43:40,199 --> 00:43:43,530
Hey.

1091
00:43:48,329 --> 00:43:50,329
I've been watching The Office like

1092
00:43:50,329 --> 00:43:52,329
a dumbass lately. I don't know why. It's a good show.

1093
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:54,329
There's an episode.

1094
00:43:54,329 --> 00:43:56,329
It's a good show. I don't know. It's just it was something to watch

1095
00:43:56,329 --> 00:43:58,329
and there's an episode where in the beginning

1096
00:43:58,329 --> 00:44:00,329
it was cold open.

1097
00:44:00,329 --> 00:44:02,329
We talked about the weather and now I'm talking about

1098
00:44:02,329 --> 00:44:04,329
I'm describing episodes of The Office.

1099
00:44:04,329 --> 00:44:06,329
Your audience is going to be like, can you stop

1100
00:44:06,329 --> 00:44:08,329
streaming with this guy?

1101
00:44:08,329 --> 00:44:10,329
This guy sucks. He can't even

1102
00:44:10,329 --> 00:44:12,329
stay connected to Rockstar's video game

1103
00:44:12,329 --> 00:44:14,329
servers and he's talking about the weather.

1104
00:44:14,329 --> 00:44:18,039
Anyway, there's an episode

1105
00:44:18,039 --> 00:44:20,039
where they go A and I'm going to stop

1106
00:44:20,039 --> 00:44:22,039
there. It's good enough.

1107
00:44:22,039 --> 00:44:24,039
There's an episode where they go A.

1108
00:44:24,039 --> 00:44:26,039
Yeah, they go A.

1109
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:28,280
Here, I'll invite you again.

1110
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,280
We have another problem at this point.

1111
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:32,280
I'll just like watch you stream.

1112
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,280
No, I mean, I'm down to

1113
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,280
try a couple more matches at least.

1114
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,280
It's worth a shot.

1115
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,280
I think we could have some fun if it

1116
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,280
just was stable. I know, I know. I don't understand.

1117
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,280
I've gotten

1118
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,280
disconnected like three or four times when I stream this too.

1119
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,280
But it happens.

1120
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,280
Usually from random matches.

1121
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:53,019
I don't understand.

1122
00:44:53,019 --> 00:44:55,019
What's the weather like on The Office?

1123
00:44:55,019 --> 00:44:57,019
What's the weather like?

1124
00:44:57,019 --> 00:44:59,019
Well,

1125
00:44:59,019 --> 00:45:01,019
there's an episode where they go A.

1126
00:45:01,019 --> 00:45:03,829
I can answer that

1127
00:45:03,829 --> 00:45:05,829
because it was filmed in

1128
00:45:05,829 --> 00:45:07,829
California and they try to make it look

1129
00:45:07,829 --> 00:45:09,829
like Scranton, Pennsylvania, so it's snowy.

1130
00:45:09,829 --> 00:45:11,829
But it's really not.

1131
00:45:15,719 --> 00:45:17,719
Well,

1132
00:45:17,719 --> 00:45:21,559
I got booted again.

1133
00:45:21,559 --> 00:45:23,559
Super cool.

1134
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:25,559
Wait, wait, wait, wait. But you're still

1135
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:27,559
like, you haven't had any problems streaming.

1136
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:29,559
Oh, no, not at all. I've got no drop frames at all.

1137
00:45:29,559 --> 00:45:32,570
It's something

1138
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:34,570
to do with where I'm coming from.

1139
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:36,869
Why does Rockstar not want to

1140
00:45:36,869 --> 00:45:38,869
acknowledge Las Vegas?

1141
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:40,869
Maybe they don't. I don't understand.

1142
00:45:40,869 --> 00:45:42,869
No, I'm not deleting the game.

1143
00:45:45,619 --> 00:45:47,619
Yeah, I don't know. It's something to do with

1144
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:49,800
how they connect. I figured

1145
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,800
it was a problem from three days ago because it was the

1146
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,800
first day or two of the beta, but

1147
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,800
it looks like it's kind of just a server routing

1148
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,800
or server problem

1149
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,800
with Rockstar. And

1150
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,230
specifically either Las Vegas

1151
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:04,599
servers or

1152
00:46:04,599 --> 00:46:06,599
California servers because, I mean, technically

1153
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:09,929
I'm on the West Coast.

1154
00:46:09,929 --> 00:46:11,929
Well, maybe they'll get that sorted out in a couple days.

1155
00:46:11,929 --> 00:46:13,929
That's what I was hoping for

1156
00:46:13,929 --> 00:46:15,929
three days ago.

1157
00:46:15,929 --> 00:46:17,929
Yeah, sorry. Sorry this is kind of

1158
00:46:17,929 --> 00:46:19,929
impeding on everything.

1159
00:46:19,929 --> 00:46:21,929
That's fine. I mean, I'm still shooting people in the

1160
00:46:21,929 --> 00:46:23,929
face. It's not a big deal. But I would prefer

1161
00:46:23,929 --> 00:46:25,929
to shoot people in the face with you in an

1162
00:46:25,929 --> 00:46:28,679
actual match. That would be better.

1163
00:46:28,679 --> 00:46:30,679
I'll invite you again.

1164
00:46:30,679 --> 00:46:34,010
Let's try again. Yeah, let's try again.

1165
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:38,170
Even though it says I'm on a mission.

1166
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:40,170
Maybe they just hate you.

1167
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:43,690
I don't know, maybe. I tried restarting

1168
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:49,320
it. Moving to the country,

1169
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,320
gonna eat myself some

1170
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,320
peaches. Moving

1171
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,320
to the country, gonna eat

1172
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,320
me a lot of peaches.

1173
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,320
Look out!

1174
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,320
Look out, man!

1175
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:04,199
Peaches come

1176
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:06,199
in a can. They was put

1177
00:47:06,199 --> 00:47:08,199
there by a man.

1178
00:47:10,699 --> 00:47:12,699
I haven't heard that in a long time. Holy shit.

1179
00:47:12,699 --> 00:47:14,699
Yeah, that was

1180
00:47:14,699 --> 00:47:16,699
for you. I figured you might know about that. That was

1181
00:47:16,699 --> 00:47:18,940
great. Yeah.

1182
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:20,940
I feel like, I feel really good

1183
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:22,940
right now. I was a little sad

1184
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:24,940
about like the Rockstar server issue here, but

1185
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:26,940
I feel fantastic.

1186
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:28,940
Yeah, that just takes

1187
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:30,940
the power of song. That's all it takes.

1188
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:33,989
Alright, here we go.

1189
00:47:33,989 --> 00:47:36,230
Don't do it, Rockstar. I know

1190
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:38,230
you want to. Look at them.

1191
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:40,230
Look at them do it. Look at how much they want.

1192
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:42,230
Okay. I'm ready

1193
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:44,599
for an invite.

1194
00:47:44,599 --> 00:47:46,599
And this will be the last time because it's going to stay

1195
00:47:46,599 --> 00:47:48,599
on. I'm not going to get disconnected from

1196
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:51,030
Rockstar servers. The problem is

1197
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:53,030
I can't actually invite you now because I'm in a mission.

1198
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:55,030
Supposedly. Maybe for the better

1199
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:57,030
so I can stay connected for a minute.

1200
00:47:57,030 --> 00:48:04,010
That's what you think. I know.

1201
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:07,590
Let me try...

1202
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:09,590
Explain to me what

1203
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:11,590
you were just doing. Because

1204
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:13,590
you were doing like a randomized Ocarina

1205
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:16,539
of Time? Yeah.

1206
00:48:16,539 --> 00:48:18,539
So there's a randomizer

1207
00:48:18,539 --> 00:48:20,539
and you can assign a bunch of different

1208
00:48:20,539 --> 00:48:22,539
options. It's a really customizable randomizer.

1209
00:48:22,539 --> 00:48:24,539
And

1210
00:48:24,539 --> 00:48:26,539
all you have to do is

1211
00:48:26,539 --> 00:48:28,539
every chest...

1212
00:48:28,539 --> 00:48:30,539
Wow, I did what you did earlier.

1213
00:48:30,539 --> 00:48:32,539
Every treasure chest.

1214
00:48:32,539 --> 00:48:34,539
Oh, Jesus.

1215
00:48:34,539 --> 00:48:36,539
Good luck saying it the right way ever again.

1216
00:48:36,539 --> 00:48:38,539
Every treasure chest

1217
00:48:38,539 --> 00:48:40,539
has randomized content

1218
00:48:40,539 --> 00:48:42,539
except for a couple. And

1219
00:48:42,539 --> 00:48:44,539
you can find medallions, you can find items,

1220
00:48:44,539 --> 00:48:46,539
you can find swords, you can find all kinds of crazy shit.

1221
00:48:46,539 --> 00:48:48,539
Really? And essentially

1222
00:48:48,539 --> 00:48:50,539
you have to get the six medallions

1223
00:48:50,539 --> 00:48:52,539
and they could be anywhere. And then you can fight

1224
00:48:52,539 --> 00:48:54,539
Ganon. And you can

1225
00:48:54,539 --> 00:48:56,539
make it really hard for yourself

1226
00:48:56,539 --> 00:48:58,539
or you can make it a lot easier for yourself.

1227
00:48:58,539 --> 00:49:00,539
Like, for example, I started the game

1228
00:49:00,539 --> 00:49:02,539
Kakariko Village was open.

1229
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:04,539
I started the game where

1230
00:49:04,539 --> 00:49:06,539
Kokiri Forest was open so I could just leave

1231
00:49:06,539 --> 00:49:08,539
and go to the world map anytime. Oh, really?

1232
00:49:08,539 --> 00:49:10,539
So, but yeah,

1233
00:49:10,539 --> 00:49:12,539
I mean, it's kind of cool because you could just play the game

1234
00:49:12,539 --> 00:49:14,539
in like six or seven hours

1235
00:49:14,539 --> 00:49:16,539
if you're lucky and you know what you're doing.

1236
00:49:16,539 --> 00:49:18,539
So could you get everything in the first six

1237
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:20,539
chests of the game?

1238
00:49:20,539 --> 00:49:22,539
I got a hookshot in the first chest.

1239
00:49:22,539 --> 00:49:24,539
Wow. That's cool.

1240
00:49:24,539 --> 00:49:26,539
And you can get some, I got a

1241
00:49:26,539 --> 00:49:28,539
medallion real early. You can get really broken

1242
00:49:28,539 --> 00:49:30,539
like stuff early on

1243
00:49:30,539 --> 00:49:32,539
or you can get five blue rupees.

1244
00:49:32,539 --> 00:49:34,539
Five rupees every time.

1245
00:49:34,539 --> 00:49:36,539
Which is the worst thing ever.

1246
00:49:36,539 --> 00:49:38,539
Yeah, that's like

1247
00:49:38,539 --> 00:49:40,539
what is it, green rupee the lowest?

1248
00:49:40,539 --> 00:49:43,929
Mhm.

1249
00:49:43,929 --> 00:49:45,929
But it's a really fun thing.

1250
00:49:45,929 --> 00:49:47,929
I love it. I'm really enjoying it.

1251
00:49:47,929 --> 00:49:50,739
No, it seemed cool. It seemed really cool

1252
00:49:50,739 --> 00:49:53,110
from what I saw.

1253
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:55,110
You've never done a randomizer stream?

1254
00:49:55,110 --> 00:49:57,110
Never. I mean, the only randomizer

1255
00:49:57,110 --> 00:49:59,110
I've ever heard of or ever done was something like

1256
00:49:59,110 --> 00:50:04,489
Team Fortress

1257
00:50:04,489 --> 00:50:06,489
and that just randomizes loadouts, not like

1258
00:50:06,489 --> 00:50:08,489
randomizing the whole game essentially. Oh, I see.

1259
00:50:08,489 --> 00:50:11,110
I gotcha. So I'm just

1260
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:13,110
kind of, I'm just running until my character

1261
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:15,539
dies.

1262
00:50:15,539 --> 00:50:17,539
Is that possible?

1263
00:50:17,539 --> 00:50:19,539
You need to feed the character eventually.

1264
00:50:19,539 --> 00:50:21,539
Hey chat, does anyone know how to

1265
00:50:21,539 --> 00:50:23,539
abandon this stupid mailbag quest?

1266
00:50:23,539 --> 00:50:25,539
Oh yeah, I got stuck in

1267
00:50:25,539 --> 00:50:27,909
the mail room by the way. You gotta be

1268
00:50:27,909 --> 00:50:36,869
careful with that mail door.

1269
00:50:36,869 --> 00:50:38,869
Shoot yourself in the head. Okay, now

1270
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:40,869
the timer ran out. Okay, so now I can probably

1271
00:50:40,869 --> 00:50:45,860
invite you.

1272
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:48,619
Yes, the mail door.

1273
00:50:48,619 --> 00:50:50,619
The door to the mail room. The mail door.

1274
00:50:50,619 --> 00:50:52,619
I got trapped in there. Remember when I was

1275
00:50:52,619 --> 00:50:56,199
breaking windows? Did someone not

1276
00:50:56,199 --> 00:50:58,199
understand? They were like, what are you talking about, Jerma?

1277
00:50:58,199 --> 00:51:00,199
They were saying like M-A-L-E, like

1278
00:51:00,199 --> 00:51:02,199
mail door. Oh.

1279
00:51:02,199 --> 00:51:13,130
Okay.

1280
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:15,559
You alright? You okay?

1281
00:51:15,559 --> 00:51:17,989
What happened?

1282
00:51:17,989 --> 00:51:19,989
Tell me in minute detail.

1283
00:51:19,989 --> 00:51:21,989
I got shot in the head.

1284
00:51:21,989 --> 00:51:23,989
Hey, can you invite me?

1285
00:51:23,989 --> 00:51:25,989
I see.

1286
00:51:25,989 --> 00:51:27,989
Because my invite thing is totally

1287
00:51:27,989 --> 00:51:29,989
blocked out for some reason.

1288
00:51:29,989 --> 00:51:33,559
Mine is too.

1289
00:51:33,559 --> 00:51:35,559
You invites and updates.

1290
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:38,250
Can I?

1291
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:41,699
Yeah, I can't invite you either.

1292
00:51:41,699 --> 00:51:45,670
It's blocked out.

1293
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:47,670
Rockstar, what the heck are you doing here?

1294
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:55,289
I guess I'll just die.

1295
00:51:55,289 --> 00:51:57,289
Are we in the same game?

1296
00:51:57,289 --> 00:52:00,170
I'm playing Red Dead Redemption 3.

1297
00:52:00,170 --> 00:52:02,539
Well, because

1298
00:52:02,539 --> 00:52:04,539
if we're in the same lobby,

1299
00:52:04,539 --> 00:52:07,159
I don't think so.

1300
00:52:07,159 --> 00:52:09,159
No, because I can't. No, I don't think so either.

1301
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:11,159
Because I can't even get you into my posse.

1302
00:52:11,159 --> 00:52:15,130
R1 on the player list.

1303
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:19,159
Apparently

1304
00:52:19,159 --> 00:52:24,280
you're not even online.

1305
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:26,280
Yeah, apparently.

1306
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:28,280
Go to your friends tabs or go to players and hit R1.

1307
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:30,460
And does it say I'm like

1308
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:39,590
online?

1309
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:45,420
I'm just eating baked beans.

1310
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:47,420
You know what's a cool thing to do as a streamer I found out

1311
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:49,420
I've learned over the years?

1312
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:51,420
Eat food while you're streaming.

1313
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:53,420
I can't

1314
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,420
do that, man.

1315
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:57,420
It's either the best thing for some

1316
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:59,420
people and they love it.

1317
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:01,420
Or it's like they'll watch

1318
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:03,420
the stream specifically because it's social eating.

1319
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:05,420
Yeah, I've heard of that.

1320
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:07,420
They hate the way it sounds, yeah.

1321
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:09,420
I've heard of like the social eating thing, but not just like

1322
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:11,420
oh, hey guys, just gonna take a break from Red Dead

1323
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:13,420
and eat a plate of spaghetti. Hold on.

1324
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:15,420
I couldn't do it. I don't want people

1325
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:17,420
to look at me when I'm eating.

1326
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:19,420
Yeah, don't fucking look at me is what I say.

1327
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:21,420
I don't?

1328
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:23,420
When I go to dinner, out with friends

1329
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:25,420
or family and the food comes out,

1330
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:27,420
I hate the fact that everyone's just

1331
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:29,420
able to look at me just across the table.

1332
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:31,420
Fuck, you know what?

1333
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:33,420
Let's go off on this. Fuck the whole table

1334
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:35,420
scenario that we have here in the United States.

1335
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,420
Somebody's sitting across from you.

1336
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:39,420
They're always looking at you and they're staring at your eyes

1337
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:41,420
like you do the weird eye contact when you both take a huge

1338
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:43,420
bite and you're like, oh, whoops.

1339
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:45,420
Just line us up on the

1340
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:47,420
other side so it's just a giant bench

1341
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:49,420
and no one's across

1342
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:51,420
from you. Everyone just sits and you can fit so many

1343
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:54,619
more people. Like Thanksgiving, except

1344
00:53:54,619 --> 00:53:56,619
for the fact that you don't have to sit across from anybody.

1345
00:53:56,619 --> 00:53:59,369
That's like the Last Supper you mean, right?

1346
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:01,369
What the fuck are you doing here?

1347
00:54:01,369 --> 00:54:03,369
How did you get in here? How did you get in here?

1348
00:54:03,369 --> 00:54:07,590
No, no, no. Get off me.

1349
00:54:07,590 --> 00:54:10,280
Get off me.

1350
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:14,309
Get your hands in the air. How did you find me?

1351
00:54:14,309 --> 00:54:17,000
I don't even understand how

1352
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,840
you got in here.

1353
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:24,679
I went into

1354
00:54:24,679 --> 00:54:26,679
the menus and I found you.

1355
00:54:26,679 --> 00:54:29,619
Easy, easy.

1356
00:54:29,619 --> 00:54:32,500
Watch the edge.

1357
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,500
Oh my god, you're choking me to death.

1358
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,500
Oh shit, I didn't mean to do that.

1359
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:39,449
Oh, that's a shame.

1360
00:54:39,449 --> 00:54:41,449
No, stay right there.

1361
00:54:41,449 --> 00:54:43,449
I want to take a picture of you.

1362
00:54:43,449 --> 00:54:47,420
I want to get like a good photo of you.

1363
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:54,969
By the way, I'm the camera.

1364
00:54:54,969 --> 00:54:57,460
Okay.

1365
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:05,210
I lived. I somehow lived.

1366
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:07,210
Oh, look who I've got.

1367
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:10,659
Hey, come on down here.

1368
00:55:10,659 --> 00:55:12,659
Come retrieve your body. Who's this?

1369
00:55:12,659 --> 00:55:14,659
Oh, that's me. Was that me?

1370
00:55:14,659 --> 00:55:16,659
Yeah, I threw you down there.

1371
00:55:16,659 --> 00:55:18,659
What the fuck? Hold on a minute.

1372
00:55:18,659 --> 00:55:21,539
I know what we're going to do today.

1373
00:55:21,539 --> 00:55:25,559
Okay, we're going to make

1374
00:55:25,559 --> 00:55:27,559
a bunch of dead bodies of ourselves

1375
00:55:27,559 --> 00:55:29,800
on this ledge.

1376
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,800
It really will be Westworld then.

1377
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,800
I just invited you to a posse though.

1378
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,800
Oh, did you?

1379
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,800
I don't see any invites.

1380
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,800
I think I just kicked the muskrat.

1381
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:42,039
How come I don't have any invites from you?

1382
00:55:42,039 --> 00:55:44,659
Because this fucking

1383
00:55:44,659 --> 00:55:46,659
service is so fucking broken.

1384
00:55:48,659 --> 00:55:58,389
I'm gone.

1385
00:55:58,389 --> 00:56:00,389
Here's the wild thing.

1386
00:56:00,389 --> 00:56:02,389
This is worse than before. This is worse than it was

1387
00:56:02,389 --> 00:56:05,139
three days ago.

1388
00:56:05,139 --> 00:56:07,139
Did you get disconnected again?

1389
00:56:07,139 --> 00:56:10,599
Yeah, this is worse than it was three days ago.

1390
00:56:10,599 --> 00:56:18,260
Damn.

1391
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:20,260
There's something wrong with

1392
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:22,260
what Rockstar servers on the East Coast,

1393
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:24,260
West Coast specifically, has to be.

1394
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:26,820
I'm sure it's something.

1395
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:28,820
Because I have a

1396
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:30,820
stable connection everywhere.

1397
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:38,949
Okay, this is weird.

1398
00:56:38,949 --> 00:56:40,949
I'm lagging too because my character is doing the

1399
00:56:40,949 --> 00:56:42,949
whistling face, but there are no whistles coming out of it.

1400
00:56:48,579 --> 00:56:50,579
He says he doesn't eat on stream, but

1401
00:56:50,579 --> 00:56:52,579
there was a time you shoved a bunch of taquitos

1402
00:56:52,579 --> 00:56:54,579
into your mouth or something.

1403
00:56:54,579 --> 00:56:59,769
The character is going

1404
00:56:59,769 --> 00:57:02,579
meme-y.

1405
00:57:02,579 --> 00:57:04,579
I'm all lagged out.

1406
00:57:04,579 --> 00:57:06,579
Did you eat like taquitos

1407
00:57:06,579 --> 00:57:08,579
on stream?

1408
00:57:08,579 --> 00:57:10,579
They said you don't

1409
00:57:10,579 --> 00:57:12,579
eat on stream, but you ate a

1410
00:57:12,579 --> 00:57:14,579
shitload of taquitos when you were shitfaced or something.

1411
00:57:14,579 --> 00:57:17,590
What?

1412
00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:19,590
Oh, they're talking about

1413
00:57:19,590 --> 00:57:21,590
me.

1414
00:57:21,590 --> 00:57:27,420
Oh, me.

1415
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:29,420
You don't remember this.

1416
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:31,420
I guess you were shitfaced.

1417
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:33,420
When did I eat taquitos?

1418
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:39,239
What the fuck are you guys talking about?

1419
00:57:39,239 --> 00:57:41,239
I ate testiculitos.

1420
00:57:41,239 --> 00:57:43,239
Vdub gave me some.

1421
00:57:43,239 --> 00:57:45,239
What?

1422
00:57:45,239 --> 00:57:47,539
What the fuck?

1423
00:57:47,539 --> 00:57:49,539
I have a rival as a pro Call of Duty player

1424
00:57:49,539 --> 00:57:51,539
named Vdub.

1425
00:57:51,539 --> 00:57:53,539
He's got a thing called testiculitos.

1426
00:57:53,539 --> 00:57:55,539
It's a long story.

1427
00:57:55,539 --> 00:57:57,539
Testiculitos.

1428
00:57:57,539 --> 00:57:59,539
Okay, is your invite

1429
00:57:59,539 --> 00:58:01,849
grayed out?

1430
00:58:01,849 --> 00:58:03,849
Oh yeah, yes it is.

1431
00:58:03,849 --> 00:58:05,849
So, I don't know, maybe there's just a problem again

1432
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:07,849
and we picked the great, perfect day

1433
00:58:07,849 --> 00:58:09,849
three days later where it just doesn't work

1434
00:58:09,849 --> 00:58:12,659
again.

1435
00:58:12,659 --> 00:58:14,659
I mean, I know how I joined your game before.

1436
00:58:14,659 --> 00:58:16,659
I went into the friends menu, I went to your profile

1437
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:18,659
and then I clicked join, so I'm going to do that again

1438
00:58:18,659 --> 00:58:20,659
and see if that works.

1439
00:58:20,659 --> 00:58:22,659
Yeah, I don't understand, man. I wish I knew.

1440
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:32,380
Oh, there's tobacco here.

1441
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:36,659
I was wasted and

1442
00:58:36,659 --> 00:58:38,659
Kim brought me

1443
00:58:38,659 --> 00:58:42,119
taquitos.

1444
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:45,059
That didn't happen. I've never had a taquito before

1445
00:58:45,059 --> 00:58:52,679
in my life.

1446
00:58:52,679 --> 00:58:54,679
What did you just crack open?

1447
00:58:54,679 --> 00:58:57,110
Is it like a coarse light?

1448
00:58:57,110 --> 00:58:59,110
No, it was gum, dude.

1449
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:01,110
I got disconnected again.

1450
00:59:01,110 --> 00:59:03,610
Is there something else we can do?

1451
00:59:03,610 --> 00:59:05,610
I feel like I've like torn

1452
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:07,610
you away from what you were doing and it's like,

1453
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:09,610
hey, it's been an hour and everything's just shot.

1454
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:11,610
This was the plan from the beginning.

1455
00:59:11,610 --> 00:59:13,610
This is not at all

1456
00:59:13,610 --> 00:59:15,610
disrupting me or my streaming.

1457
00:59:15,610 --> 00:59:18,809
Well, I mean, I kind of have to go soon anyway,

1458
00:59:18,809 --> 00:59:20,809
so this isn't really that big of a deal. It's just a shame

1459
00:59:20,809 --> 00:59:22,809
that this doesn't work because I was having fun.

1460
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:24,809
Yeah, I really want to play it.

1461
00:59:29,159 --> 00:59:31,159
Just watch you play. We're going to

1462
00:59:31,159 --> 00:59:33,159
live vicariously through you.

1463
00:59:33,159 --> 00:59:35,159
Yeah, but even if you do watch me play, I'm going to get

1464
00:59:35,159 --> 00:59:37,159
disconnected too. I've been getting disconnected.

1465
00:59:37,159 --> 00:59:39,849
Alert, you have been disconnected

1466
00:59:39,849 --> 00:59:41,849
from Red Dead Online due to a fault on

1467
00:59:41,849 --> 00:59:43,849
Rockstar Game Services.

1468
00:59:43,849 --> 00:59:48,500
When is the beta supposed to be done?

1469
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:54,309
A year.

1470
00:59:54,309 --> 00:59:59,539
Alert. Hey, did you

1471
00:59:59,539 --> 01:00:02,170
get the alert? I got an alert.

1472
01:00:02,170 --> 01:00:04,860
Yep. I got it on my cell phone.

1473
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:07,480
Hey, please ping me.

1474
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:09,480
Please send me a text every time that

1475
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:12,360
the servers go down. By the way,

1476
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:14,360
I think Kraken was playing this not too long ago,

1477
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,360
so maybe we can get the old crew

1478
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:18,360
back together. Yeah, I'd

1479
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:20,360
love to actually play this because what's here would

1480
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:23,369
be fun. Yeah.

1481
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:25,369
Maybe not, you know, when the game

1482
01:00:25,369 --> 01:00:27,369
is still broken, but when it's fixed,

1483
01:00:27,369 --> 01:00:29,369
we can

1484
01:00:29,369 --> 01:00:31,860
bug Kraken. Yeah, how many people

1485
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:33,860
can you have in like a squad?

1486
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:36,099
I think four.

1487
01:00:36,099 --> 01:00:38,099
Four for a non-paid posse.

1488
01:00:38,099 --> 01:00:40,099
You have to pay,

1489
01:00:40,099 --> 01:00:42,469
you have to actually pay for it

1490
01:00:42,469 --> 01:00:45,480
with like in-game money.

1491
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:47,480
That's kind of weird. That's cool.

1492
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:49,480
Yeah. What about

1493
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:51,480
Critical? Critical is like, he's a bigger

1494
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,480
YouTuber slash street, like

1495
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:55,480
I guess more YouTuber, but he's like such a big

1496
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:57,480
YouTuber. I always feel bad bothering him. I don't know.

1497
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:00,150
It's hard to explain.

1498
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:02,150
I would like to get Critical involved.

1499
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:04,150
He's not a very proactive person

1500
01:01:04,150 --> 01:01:06,150
when it comes to stuff like this.

1501
01:01:06,150 --> 01:01:08,710
He threw

1502
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:10,710
cards at me the other day, and

1503
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:12,710
I was screaming at him and stuff. So yeah,

1504
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:14,710
maybe he'll play. You think he would be

1505
01:01:14,710 --> 01:01:16,710
down? Maybe, yeah.

1506
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:18,710
I'll give him a shout. I was going to talk to him anyways.

1507
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:20,710
So how

1508
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:22,710
about we make a plan without

1509
01:01:22,710 --> 01:01:24,710
people expecting it to be

1510
01:01:24,710 --> 01:01:26,710
like Word of God, that it's going

1511
01:01:26,710 --> 01:01:28,710
to happen 100%. But when this

1512
01:01:28,710 --> 01:01:30,710
game gets fixed, and when

1513
01:01:30,710 --> 01:01:32,710
we can play with a stable connection,

1514
01:01:32,710 --> 01:01:34,710
me, you, Criken,

1515
01:01:34,710 --> 01:01:36,710
Critical will try to get like a thing going.

1516
01:01:36,710 --> 01:01:39,139
Oh, sick! That sounds

1517
01:01:39,139 --> 01:01:41,699
good. Cool.

1518
01:01:41,699 --> 01:01:43,699
So,

1519
01:01:43,699 --> 01:01:45,699
I think,

1520
01:01:45,699 --> 01:01:47,699
I don't know what your plan is. Are you going to just

1521
01:01:47,699 --> 01:01:50,519
take off? What, tonight?

1522
01:01:50,519 --> 01:01:52,519
Like right now. Like

1523
01:01:52,519 --> 01:01:54,519
right now? I'm going to invite you one more time because

1524
01:01:54,519 --> 01:01:56,519
I think the server's restarted. Oh, the server's

1525
01:01:56,519 --> 01:01:58,519
restarted? Yeah, maybe.

1526
01:01:58,519 --> 01:02:04,090
Okay. Somebody said,

1527
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:06,090
oh no, it's the end of the stream voice.

1528
01:02:08,090 --> 01:02:10,090
Mine? No, I like mine.

1529
01:02:10,090 --> 01:02:12,090
Like, all right, do you do a thing when you

1530
01:02:12,090 --> 01:02:14,090
stream, when like, okay, let's say you've been streaming for

1531
01:02:14,090 --> 01:02:16,090
you know, six, seven, four,

1532
01:02:16,090 --> 01:02:18,090
whatever, five. You're getting a little tired.

1533
01:02:18,090 --> 01:02:20,389
Do you do like a, okay,

1534
01:02:20,389 --> 01:02:22,389
so, do you do like a, I'm going to

1535
01:02:22,389 --> 01:02:24,389
end the stream voice? Yep.

1536
01:02:24,389 --> 01:02:26,389
Yeah. I think so.

1537
01:02:26,389 --> 01:02:32,340
I didn't just do it right there.

1538
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:34,340
Are you in game? I'm loading in

1539
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:36,340
right now. Okay, when, okay, let me know

1540
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:38,340
when you, when you load it in because it says

1541
01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:40,340
it wants me to invite, um,

1542
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:43,289
it wants to invite me to watch

1543
01:02:43,289 --> 01:02:45,590
your stream. It wants to invite

1544
01:02:45,590 --> 01:02:47,590
you to watch my stream? To watch your

1545
01:02:47,590 --> 01:02:49,590
gameplay, yes. Oh, you're going to come watch

1546
01:02:49,590 --> 01:02:51,590
my gameplay? That's what it wants, yeah.

1547
01:02:51,590 --> 01:02:54,280
Share play? Yeah,

1548
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:56,280
it's the end of the phone call voice.

1549
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:58,710
Yeah, that's, when you

1550
01:02:58,710 --> 01:03:01,460
talk to somebody on the phone. And you're

1551
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:03,769
like, oh, all right. Yeah,

1552
01:03:03,769 --> 01:03:05,769
that's how people end conversations.

1553
01:03:05,769 --> 01:03:07,769
You add some inflection to let people know

1554
01:03:07,769 --> 01:03:09,769
that, hey, this is like, the conversation

1555
01:03:09,769 --> 01:03:12,329
is going to be over here in a minute.

1556
01:03:12,329 --> 01:03:14,329
My, my, like, here's mine.

1557
01:03:14,329 --> 01:03:16,329
All right. Yeah.

1558
01:03:16,329 --> 01:03:18,329
All right.

1559
01:03:18,329 --> 01:03:20,329
All right. And then it goes up real

1560
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:22,329
high. All right. Yep.

1561
01:03:22,329 --> 01:03:25,590
Mine is usually,

1562
01:03:25,590 --> 01:03:27,590
it starts with, okay, so,

1563
01:03:27,590 --> 01:03:29,590
or it's, but,

1564
01:03:29,590 --> 01:03:31,960
yeah. Okay, so, I

1565
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:35,099
think. How about cool?

1566
01:03:35,099 --> 01:03:37,099
You're doing one of the cool.

1567
01:03:37,099 --> 01:03:39,099
I don't know if I like cool, because

1568
01:03:39,099 --> 01:03:41,099
cool kind of sounds like I'm not interested in

1569
01:03:41,099 --> 01:03:43,099
conversation, like a cool, all

1570
01:03:43,099 --> 01:03:45,099
right, I gotta go. It's like, you didn't think that was cool.

1571
01:03:45,099 --> 01:03:47,099
If you thought that was cool, you'd just stick around a little bit longer, right?

1572
01:03:47,099 --> 01:03:49,099
Yeah, it's a little passive

1573
01:03:49,099 --> 01:03:51,530
aggressive. Yeah. I think

1574
01:03:51,530 --> 01:03:53,530
all right works, because all right's like, all right, like, it's over.

1575
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:56,900
All right. How's

1576
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:58,900
the weather on your phone, by the way?

1577
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:01,400
My phone? It's pretty good.

1578
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:03,699
Yep. All right.

1579
01:04:03,699 --> 01:04:06,460
All right.

1580
01:04:06,460 --> 01:04:08,460
My invites are grayed out.

1581
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:10,460
There we go. I gotcha. Okay, the invites are still

1582
01:04:10,460 --> 01:04:12,460
grayed out, but I can invite you to the posse. We're in the same

1583
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:14,460
server. Oh. All right.

1584
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:17,460
Come find me. Come find me, and

1585
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:19,960
come take a picture with me.

1586
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,960
Okay. Well, I think we should try to do,

1587
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:23,960
while we're in a server together, we should try to do, like,

1588
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:25,960
an actual, like,

1589
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:27,960
fight match. Yeah.

1590
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:29,960
Okay. So it starts now,

1591
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:32,969
then. I think we have to be in the posse.

1592
01:04:32,969 --> 01:04:36,420
Oh, okay. I thought

1593
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:38,420
you meant, like, you and me are just gonna fight.

1594
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:40,980
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I was, I was gonna say

1595
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:43,860
we could do a, like,

1596
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:46,360
you know, like a team death match thing.

1597
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:48,789
Oh, I actually tried to load, yeah, I tried to load into one.

1598
01:04:48,789 --> 01:04:51,099
No, that, apparently

1599
01:04:51,099 --> 01:04:53,099
the weather is a little too harsh on these, yeah,

1600
01:04:53,099 --> 01:04:56,300
I'm disconnected.

1601
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:58,300
No shit already? No shit, yep.

1602
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:00,659
Already, this is way,

1603
01:05:00,659 --> 01:05:02,840
we at least, three days ago, we could

1604
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:04,840
play for at least 20, 30 minutes

1605
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:08,170
before it would do this, so. It's a shame.

1606
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:10,170
This is a shame. Well, I mean, this is not, this is

1607
01:05:10,170 --> 01:05:12,170
not a bother to me. I want you to know

1608
01:05:12,170 --> 01:05:14,170
that this is also affecting me.

1609
01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:16,170
That's okay, it's affecting me too.

1610
01:05:16,170 --> 01:05:18,170
Okay. I think, let's just wait

1611
01:05:18,170 --> 01:05:20,170
a little bit, wait a couple days, and then we'll try

1612
01:05:20,170 --> 01:05:23,179
again. That sounds good to me. I wanna, I wanna

1613
01:05:23,179 --> 01:05:25,179
actually play this with you, but yeah, it's a

1614
01:05:25,179 --> 01:05:28,309
shame that this isn't happening.

1615
01:05:28,309 --> 01:05:30,309
It is a shame, but it's alright. It happens.

1616
01:05:30,309 --> 01:05:32,619
Nothing to do about it.

1617
01:05:32,619 --> 01:05:34,619
What are you gonna, what are you gonna cry, just cry over

1618
01:05:34,619 --> 01:05:37,110
spell servers? I can jump off a cliff.

1619
01:05:37,110 --> 01:05:39,670
Oh, I just did that.

1620
01:05:39,670 --> 01:05:41,670
I love how that's both the go-to

1621
01:05:41,670 --> 01:05:43,670
thing, whatever.

1622
01:05:43,670 --> 01:05:48,519
Sleep off.

1623
01:05:48,519 --> 01:05:50,519
You can't cry, you can't cry over

1624
01:05:50,519 --> 01:05:52,820
spilled servers. No, you can't.

1625
01:05:52,820 --> 01:05:55,579
I'm just gonna go and do

1626
01:05:55,579 --> 01:05:57,579
like a showdown match.

1627
01:05:57,579 --> 01:06:00,630
You know, I have like another

1628
01:06:00,630 --> 01:06:02,630
10, 20 minutes that I'm gonna play this, so

1629
01:06:02,630 --> 01:06:04,630
may as well play.

1630
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:07,449
Oh shit, someone got a jump. Can you

1631
01:06:07,449 --> 01:06:09,449
explain, is it, it's

1632
01:06:09,449 --> 01:06:11,619
jup or jump?

1633
01:06:11,619 --> 01:06:13,619
It is, it is

1634
01:06:13,619 --> 01:06:15,860
Jupiter, jup.

1635
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:17,860
Okay, because I've been saying, I think the chat tricked me into

1636
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:19,860
saying jup. They did. I was like, yeah, but it's Jupiter.

1637
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:21,860
It's pronounced jup. Yeah, they lied to you.

1638
01:06:21,860 --> 01:06:24,039
They were like, nah, bro. Yeah, figures.

1639
01:06:24,039 --> 01:06:26,039
I mean, I've said, I've clarified

1640
01:06:26,039 --> 01:06:28,039
it at least a hundred times. It is

1641
01:06:28,039 --> 01:06:30,039
Jupiter, the planet is Jupiter, it's not Jupiter.

1642
01:06:30,039 --> 01:06:33,369
Oh yeah, there's the moon, there's

1643
01:06:33,369 --> 01:06:35,369
the, oh, there's, there's the mon.

1644
01:06:35,369 --> 01:06:37,539
There's Murs.

1645
01:06:37,539 --> 01:06:39,539
What's back there, oh, that's Venus.

1646
01:06:39,539 --> 01:06:42,099
What else? Oh, Jupiter.

1647
01:06:42,099 --> 01:06:44,099
Oh, of course. Behind that you got

1648
01:06:44,099 --> 01:06:46,099
Plateau, yeah.

1649
01:06:46,099 --> 01:06:51,219
Plateau is my favorite, yeah.

1650
01:06:51,219 --> 01:06:53,219
So, can I ask you why it

1651
01:06:53,219 --> 01:06:55,219
exists? Because it's become a bit of

1652
01:06:55,219 --> 01:06:57,219
a local chat, like a lot of your memes have spilled

1653
01:06:57,219 --> 01:06:59,219
over into my life. I want you to know that.

1654
01:06:59,219 --> 01:07:01,530
Oh, I'm sorry. I don't mind.

1655
01:07:01,530 --> 01:07:03,530
I'm sure it's been somewhat vice versa,

1656
01:07:03,530 --> 01:07:07,940
but I'll take it.

1657
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:09,940
Well, I don't, I just

1658
01:07:09,940 --> 01:07:12,250
one day was looking through

1659
01:07:12,250 --> 01:07:14,420
my, my mother got me

1660
01:07:14,420 --> 01:07:17,110
a telescope when I was younger, and

1661
01:07:17,110 --> 01:07:19,110
I've always been like interested in the stars

1662
01:07:19,110 --> 01:07:21,289
and the moon and everything.

1663
01:07:21,289 --> 01:07:23,590
And that just, I just, those are

1664
01:07:23,590 --> 01:07:25,590
images that were taken. I just

1665
01:07:25,590 --> 01:07:27,590
I'm into the planets and I think the solar

1666
01:07:27,590 --> 01:07:29,900
system's really cool and just

1667
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:31,900
through the telescope I have a picture

1668
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:34,579
that's able to take photos. It's one of those things

1669
01:07:34,579 --> 01:07:36,579
that you know of, oh, you can take binoculars, you can take pictures.

1670
01:07:36,579 --> 01:07:38,579
But if you're at like the baseball game

1671
01:07:38,579 --> 01:07:40,579
or you have a telescope and you're at the baseball

1672
01:07:40,579 --> 01:07:42,579
game, you want to get like a good close up of a home plate

1673
01:07:42,579 --> 01:07:44,579
and who's batting when you're in the bleachers.

1674
01:07:44,579 --> 01:07:46,889
So yeah, it's a telescopic

1675
01:07:46,889 --> 01:07:49,829
view of just, that's just what they look like.

1676
01:07:49,829 --> 01:07:52,780
Chat, is he lying? I mean,

1677
01:07:52,780 --> 01:07:54,780
the telescope is an incredibly expensive

1678
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:56,780
it's at least like a

1679
01:07:56,780 --> 01:07:59,019
it's like $145. It's like

1680
01:07:59,019 --> 01:08:01,019
$144.99.

1681
01:08:01,019 --> 01:08:03,019
No, that doesn't sound like an expensive telescope.

1682
01:08:03,019 --> 01:08:05,019
It makes it the most expensive one you can get on Amazon.

1683
01:08:05,019 --> 01:08:09,050
I believe you because

1684
01:08:09,050 --> 01:08:14,300
I don't know why I believe you, but I do, but I

1685
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:16,300
feel like I shouldn't. No, that's just

1686
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:18,600
what the planets look like. Go do it.

1687
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:20,600
Wait, your mother got this for you when you were like

1688
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:22,600
10 and you got it on Amazon? No, no, no.

1689
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:24,600
When I was younger, my mother

1690
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,600
got me a telescope, but it's what interests me so much

1691
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,600
in the solar system. So you bought another one?

1692
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:30,600
Yeah, so years later obviously

1693
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:32,600
I'm a grown man now.

1694
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:34,600
You know, 20, 24 and

1695
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,970
decided I was going to

1696
01:08:36,970 --> 01:08:38,970
keep my passion going and that's

1697
01:08:38,970 --> 01:08:40,970
the solar system and the planets and those are just

1698
01:08:40,970 --> 01:08:43,270
images taken from the telescope.

1699
01:08:43,270 --> 01:08:47,050
Wait, you're 24?

1700
01:08:47,050 --> 01:08:50,949
What do you mean? Chat, how much is Jerma

1701
01:08:50,949 --> 01:08:53,899
lying? 85% of the time.

1702
01:08:53,899 --> 01:08:58,420
That's probably what it is.

1703
01:08:58,420 --> 01:09:00,420
No, he's your age. You're my age.

1704
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:03,819
Yeah, but I got

1705
01:09:03,819 --> 01:09:06,060
We're talking about like internal age, you know?

1706
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:08,060
Right, right, how do you feel?

1707
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:10,060
I feel

1708
01:09:10,060 --> 01:09:12,060
I feel like 45, but I mean

1709
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:14,060
internally I wish I was 25.

1710
01:09:14,060 --> 01:09:16,939
I believe that. Alright, so I've

1711
01:09:16,939 --> 01:09:18,939
been in the game for more than 30 seconds

1712
01:09:18,939 --> 01:09:20,939
and I'm not disconnected yet.

1713
01:09:20,939 --> 01:09:22,939
Wait, in my game?

1714
01:09:22,939 --> 01:09:25,180
Am I in your game?

1715
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:27,180
Are you playing a death match?

1716
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:29,180
Oh, I'm not, but I'm ready for you when you come out maybe.

1717
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:31,180
It's possible, it's very possible

1718
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:33,180
we'll get to play for like 20 minutes.

1719
01:09:33,180 --> 01:09:35,420
I like the idea that we're doing a co-op match

1720
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:37,420
of Red Dead, but playing separately

1721
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:39,420
in separate servers.

1722
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:43,260
What is Sean doing here?

1723
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:45,560
So here's the thing, I wanted to

1724
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:47,560
actually tell you that I also had a

1725
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:49,560
telescope when I was younger. This is no bullshit.

1726
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,560
So when you say that, I was like fucking

1727
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:53,560
fascinated. I wanted to be an astronomer when I was a kid.

1728
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:55,560
And I had a telescope, I had books,

1729
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:57,560
I had the whole fucking thing.

1730
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:59,560
I'm dead serious, which then turned into alien

1731
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:01,560
conspiracies, which was the

1732
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:03,859
wrong way to go about that.

1733
01:10:03,859 --> 01:10:05,859
Alien conspiracies.

1734
01:10:05,859 --> 01:10:08,789
Yeah, that's true.

1735
01:10:08,789 --> 01:10:11,029
Well, think about it.

1736
01:10:11,029 --> 01:10:13,029
No, but like honest to God, when you start to really

1737
01:10:13,029 --> 01:10:15,029
think about, especially when you're

1738
01:10:15,029 --> 01:10:17,720
younger, what's up there? You know what I mean?

1739
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:19,720
You're looking up there, there's like planets and the moons

1740
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:22,020
up there, what the fuck is up there?

1741
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:24,520
Jupiter. Jupiter is up there.

1742
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:28,039
So, if

1743
01:10:28,039 --> 01:10:30,039
that's true, and you got that from your telescope,

1744
01:10:30,039 --> 01:10:33,479
that's kind of cool. Yeah.

1745
01:10:35,659 --> 01:10:37,659
Your emutes don't make any sense.

1746
01:10:37,659 --> 01:10:39,899
They don't make any sense. I'm like, okay, go

1747
01:10:39,899 --> 01:10:42,840
look. Go look through a telescope

1748
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:45,399
of what the moon looks like.

1749
01:10:45,399 --> 01:10:47,770
That's just an image.

1750
01:10:47,770 --> 01:10:49,770
There's a lot of people that are

1751
01:10:49,770 --> 01:10:51,770
spouting bullshit about me.

1752
01:10:55,399 --> 01:10:57,399
They keep using the word doctor,

1753
01:10:57,399 --> 01:10:59,399
like doctor. I'm not a doctor.

1754
01:10:59,399 --> 01:11:05,529
I'm a fucking streamer.

1755
01:11:05,529 --> 01:11:08,279
Wait, you're not? No.

1756
01:11:08,279 --> 01:11:10,279
So what are some jobs you've had

1757
01:11:10,279 --> 01:11:12,279
that you've had before you were streaming? I'm just

1758
01:11:12,279 --> 01:11:14,279
curious. Doctor.

1759
01:11:14,279 --> 01:11:16,279
Physician. Mostly.

1760
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:23,340
Oddly enough, I was

1761
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:25,340
a substitute teacher

1762
01:11:25,340 --> 01:11:27,510
for a long time. Substitute.

1763
01:11:27,510 --> 01:11:29,689
That's cool.

1764
01:11:29,689 --> 01:11:31,689
I did wedding videos

1765
01:11:31,689 --> 01:11:35,720
for a while. Oh, you have

1766
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:37,720
video editing? Yeah. Yeah.

1767
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:39,720
I did some of that too, actually.

1768
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:41,720
Video editing

1769
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:43,720
video, just making

1770
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:46,340
freelance, just kind of on the

1771
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:48,340
side when I did other stuff.

1772
01:11:48,340 --> 01:11:52,439
I got real

1773
01:11:52,439 --> 01:11:54,439
gripping, thrilling stuff going on over here.

1774
01:11:54,439 --> 01:11:56,439
Thanks for hanging out, guys.

1775
01:11:56,439 --> 01:11:58,439
Oh no, I'm talking about on my stream.

1776
01:11:58,439 --> 01:12:00,439
How was the weather around those jobs?

1777
01:12:00,439 --> 01:12:02,439
It was fucking beautiful.

1778
01:12:02,439 --> 01:12:04,439
I'm talking about just on my stream.

1779
01:12:04,439 --> 01:12:06,439
I'm just riding on a road, just

1780
01:12:06,439 --> 01:12:09,380
holding X.

1781
01:12:09,380 --> 01:12:12,069
I got real thrilling stuff over here.

1782
01:12:12,069 --> 01:12:14,819
As you can see.

1783
01:12:14,819 --> 01:12:16,819
Look at those invitations.

1784
01:12:16,819 --> 01:12:18,819
I can't invite you to the match I'm in, but I'm going to try

1785
01:12:18,819 --> 01:12:20,819
to join yours.

1786
01:12:20,819 --> 01:12:23,380
No, just do your thing.

1787
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:25,380
I've come to the

1788
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:27,380
realization that this is probably just

1789
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:29,380
too good to be true.

1790
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:31,380
And you're going to get in here. I'm going to take

1791
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:33,380
a quality photo of you coming into the stream

1792
01:12:33,380 --> 01:12:35,380
into the server.

1793
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:37,380
And then it's going to go

1794
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:41,159
grrrr.

1795
01:12:41,159 --> 01:12:43,659
That's what I'm hoping.

1796
01:12:43,659 --> 01:12:45,659
No, I'm not. What?

1797
01:12:45,659 --> 01:12:47,659
I'm not hoping that happens.

1798
01:12:47,659 --> 01:12:49,659
I've become so conditioned to think it's going to.

1799
01:12:49,659 --> 01:12:53,300
Am I in your server?

1800
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:55,300
No, I'm not in your server, but I will. I'm going to get in there.

1801
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:57,300
Maybe we get a chance to do

1802
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:59,300
one more match. Let's see.

1803
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:01,300
I love that urn urn thing.

1804
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:03,300
I love it.

1805
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:05,300
Thanks, man. Yeah, I figured that would, you know,

1806
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:07,300
that's the natural evolution of Arthur's

1807
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:10,060
show.

1808
01:13:10,060 --> 01:13:12,060
Urn urn.

1809
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:14,060
Pail boss, mate.

1810
01:13:14,060 --> 01:13:17,130
Okay, you've

1811
01:13:17,130 --> 01:13:19,130
been in a match. You've been in a server for six minutes

1812
01:13:19,130 --> 01:13:21,130
without disconnect, apparently.

1813
01:13:21,130 --> 01:13:23,130
That's pretty impressive. So I'm going to join

1814
01:13:23,130 --> 01:13:25,130
yours.

1815
01:13:25,130 --> 01:13:27,130
I want a good photo of me.

1816
01:13:27,130 --> 01:13:29,750
This looks pretty good right here with the snowy

1817
01:13:29,750 --> 01:13:35,579
mountaintop. Be careful.

1818
01:13:35,579 --> 01:13:37,819
Okay, I'm good. So I got a good

1819
01:13:37,819 --> 01:13:39,819
spot for you to come on in when you get in here.

1820
01:13:39,819 --> 01:13:47,420
Cool.

1821
01:13:47,420 --> 01:13:50,300
Enable focus lock.

1822
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:52,300
So are you excited for the Detective Pokemon movie?

1823
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:55,880
Detective Pokemon? Yeah.

1824
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:58,939
I'm excited for it.

1825
01:13:58,939 --> 01:14:00,939
I think it looks really

1826
01:14:00,939 --> 01:14:02,939
fun.

1827
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:06,060
I think so. I think so, Mr. Red.

1828
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:08,060
Yeah.

1829
01:14:08,060 --> 01:14:10,060
Did you play Pokemon Let's Go?

1830
01:14:10,060 --> 01:14:12,060
I've never played

1831
01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:14,060
a Pokemon game before in my life.

1832
01:14:14,060 --> 01:14:16,060
Except for- Really? So you-

1833
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:21,800
Never.

1834
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:23,800
Pokemon, I think I did try

1835
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:26,300
to play

1836
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:28,300
Pokemon Diamond or

1837
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:30,300
Pearl, whatever that was, the one for DS. Oh, there you are.

1838
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:35,350
Look. Hey, mister.

1839
01:14:35,350 --> 01:14:37,659
Okay, I got a good photo of you.

1840
01:14:37,659 --> 01:14:39,659
That one's going on the album of friends.

1841
01:14:39,659 --> 01:14:43,500
Oh.

1842
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:46,180
You're fine.

1843
01:14:46,180 --> 01:14:48,810
You just gave me a new face.

1844
01:14:48,810 --> 01:14:53,609
Hey, mister.

1845
01:14:53,609 --> 01:14:56,300
Alright, so

1846
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:59,369
we're still here. We're not disconnected.

1847
01:14:59,369 --> 01:15:01,369
That's amazing. Yeah, neither

1848
01:15:01,369 --> 01:15:03,369
of us are ghosts. Holy shit.

1849
01:15:03,369 --> 01:15:05,369
I guess join the posse and then we'll

1850
01:15:05,369 --> 01:15:07,369
go shoot some stuff and see if that lasts.

1851
01:15:07,369 --> 01:15:09,800
Uh, posse.

1852
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:12,100
I see your posse.

1853
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:14,100
I cannot join. This posse is closed

1854
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:16,539
and cannot be joined. And I have no

1855
01:15:16,539 --> 01:15:23,130
invites.

1856
01:15:23,130 --> 01:15:27,420
This is just

1857
01:15:27,420 --> 01:15:29,420
what happens when you go

1858
01:15:29,420 --> 01:15:31,420
to the bird exhibit at the local zoo.

1859
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:33,420
Right?

1860
01:15:33,420 --> 01:15:35,420
The bird room?

1861
01:15:35,420 --> 01:15:37,420
Yeah, this is the bird room.

1862
01:15:37,420 --> 01:15:39,420
Oh, Jesus. See ya.

1863
01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:41,420
Goodbye. See you later.

1864
01:15:41,420 --> 01:15:43,420
God damn it.

1865
01:15:43,420 --> 01:15:45,420
You know what's funny? Your horse is still

1866
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:47,659
here. Yeah, he's got a better

1867
01:15:47,659 --> 01:15:49,659
connection to Rockstar apparently than I do.

1868
01:15:49,659 --> 01:15:53,819
But anyways,

1869
01:15:53,819 --> 01:15:55,819
just to follow up on the bird exhibit, have you

1870
01:15:55,819 --> 01:15:57,819
been to a butterfly exhibit?

1871
01:15:57,819 --> 01:15:59,819
I have, yeah. Well, I mean,

1872
01:15:59,819 --> 01:16:01,819
I remember the one

1873
01:16:01,819 --> 01:16:03,819
time I was in Texas

1874
01:16:03,819 --> 01:16:05,819
in Galveston there was a

1875
01:16:05,819 --> 01:16:07,819
butterfly room in some place and I went in

1876
01:16:07,819 --> 01:16:09,819
there for a bit. I don't know why I'm telling

1877
01:16:09,819 --> 01:16:11,819
you this, but yes, yes.

1878
01:16:11,819 --> 01:16:13,819
Well, I mean, it's important because

1879
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:15,819
the bird

1880
01:16:15,819 --> 01:16:17,819
room, the butterfly room is like the bird room

1881
01:16:17,819 --> 01:16:19,989
.5.

1882
01:16:19,989 --> 01:16:21,989
But the scary part about the butterfly room

1883
01:16:21,989 --> 01:16:23,989
is aren't you just terrified of

1884
01:16:23,989 --> 01:16:25,989
just being in there because there's just butterflies

1885
01:16:25,989 --> 01:16:27,989
in every direction. They're above you, they're

1886
01:16:27,989 --> 01:16:29,989
below you, they're left and right. I feel like

1887
01:16:29,989 --> 01:16:31,989
I'm just gonna like

1888
01:16:31,989 --> 01:16:33,989
Godzilla stomp on one of them. Yeah, like

1889
01:16:33,989 --> 01:16:35,989
devastate one, right? Or breathe

1890
01:16:35,989 --> 01:16:38,489
one in?

1891
01:16:38,489 --> 01:16:40,489
Maybe not that.

1892
01:16:40,489 --> 01:16:42,489
Breathe one in?

1893
01:16:42,489 --> 01:16:44,489
Like throw your nose into your lungs?

1894
01:16:44,489 --> 01:16:46,489
Yeah.

1895
01:16:46,489 --> 01:16:48,729
I guess that was kind of a

1896
01:16:48,729 --> 01:16:50,729
weird thing to say. But yeah, I thought

1897
01:16:50,729 --> 01:16:52,729
maybe that was a problem.

1898
01:16:52,729 --> 01:16:54,729
Next time I go to a butterfly room.

1899
01:16:54,729 --> 01:16:56,729
Was it Moody Gardens? Does

1900
01:16:56,729 --> 01:16:58,729
Moody Gardens have a butterfly room?

1901
01:16:58,729 --> 01:17:04,300
Moody Gardens, Butterfly.

1902
01:17:04,300 --> 01:17:06,300
Maybe I made that up. Maybe I lied.

1903
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:08,300
Yeah, they have them. Butterfly. Rainforest

1904
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:10,300
pyramid, yeah. That's that. Yep.

1905
01:17:10,300 --> 01:17:12,300
I've been to Moody Gardens.

1906
01:17:12,300 --> 01:17:14,470
Jesus Christ. I was 18 when

1907
01:17:14,470 --> 01:17:16,470
that happened. 15 years ago.

1908
01:17:16,470 --> 01:17:19,350
That's as old as some of you.

1909
01:17:19,350 --> 01:17:21,350
No offense.

1910
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:23,350
Do you forget how long ago 15

1911
01:17:23,350 --> 01:17:25,350
years ago is? You know what I mean?

1912
01:17:25,350 --> 01:17:27,350
Yeah, I know. That's a decade

1913
01:17:27,350 --> 01:17:30,229
and a half.

1914
01:17:30,229 --> 01:17:32,229
I mean, playing on the rune of time again is weird

1915
01:17:32,229 --> 01:17:34,229
for that reason. Brings back a lot

1916
01:17:34,229 --> 01:17:36,229
of memories. So what were you saying then?

1917
01:17:36,229 --> 01:17:38,229
I was making a call back.

1918
01:17:38,229 --> 01:17:40,229
I was going, okay,

1919
01:17:40,229 --> 01:17:42,229
so, Butter.

1920
01:17:42,229 --> 01:17:44,229
Alright, alright.

1921
01:17:46,409 --> 01:17:48,409
How's the weather around? Let's end this.

1922
01:17:48,409 --> 01:17:50,409
Let me

1923
01:17:50,409 --> 01:17:52,409
see. What's it gonna be like?

1924
01:17:52,409 --> 01:17:54,409
It's gonna be cloudy

1925
01:17:54,409 --> 01:17:56,409
with a chance of meatballs.

1926
01:17:56,409 --> 01:17:58,409
Why am I typing that in?

1927
01:17:58,409 --> 01:18:00,409
Cloudy with a chance of disconnect.

1928
01:18:00,409 --> 01:18:02,409
2009. That's when that came up.

1929
01:18:02,409 --> 01:18:04,409
Anyone's curious.

1930
01:18:04,409 --> 01:18:06,409
Sorry, everybody.

1931
01:18:06,409 --> 01:18:08,409
I really figured it was gonna be

1932
01:18:08,409 --> 01:18:10,409
fun. I'm sure it was nice to have you

1933
01:18:10,409 --> 01:18:12,409
as a special guest. Honestly, my audience always

1934
01:18:12,409 --> 01:18:14,409
really enjoys talking

1935
01:18:14,409 --> 01:18:16,409
about you, whether it be in a positive

1936
01:18:16,409 --> 01:18:18,409
or negative way. They enjoy you quite a bit.

1937
01:18:18,409 --> 01:18:20,409
Well,

1938
01:18:20,409 --> 01:18:22,409
thank you. Thank you,

1939
01:18:22,409 --> 01:18:24,409
everybody in the Vinesauce chat. Appreciate it.

1940
01:18:24,409 --> 01:18:26,409
Thank you, Germachat,

1941
01:18:26,409 --> 01:18:28,409
for tolerating me for a couple minutes.

1942
01:18:28,409 --> 01:18:30,409
Everybody over here loves you, dude.

1943
01:18:30,409 --> 01:18:32,899
You are like,

1944
01:18:32,899 --> 01:18:34,899
everybody here in Hearns you over here, so don't worry.

1945
01:18:34,899 --> 01:18:36,899
That is nice. I like that.

1946
01:18:36,899 --> 01:18:39,210
That's a good compliment.

1947
01:18:39,210 --> 01:18:41,210
But we'll try again.

1948
01:18:41,210 --> 01:18:43,210
Let's see what happens during the week.

1949
01:18:43,210 --> 01:18:45,640
Listen, I've been having

1950
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:47,640
disconnects too, so maybe one day we'll both

1951
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:49,640
be able to play this.

1952
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:51,640
And until then, I guess,

1953
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:53,640
you know, take care of yourself.

1954
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:55,640
Go find some good pictures of planets.

1955
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:57,640
Yeah. And you

1956
01:18:57,640 --> 01:18:59,640
yourself go look up, go

1957
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:01,640
get a telescope and look, and you'll see.

1958
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:04,010
One day I will, maybe.

1959
01:19:04,010 --> 01:19:06,010
Alright. Have a good one. And until then,

1960
01:19:06,010 --> 01:19:08,010
I'm gonna go kill a couple dudes, and then

1961
01:19:08,010 --> 01:19:10,010
we'll be in touch. We'll meet somewhere in

1962
01:19:10,010 --> 01:19:12,010
the middle. So take care, Germachat.

1963
01:19:12,010 --> 01:19:14,010
See you later, guys. Take care. Bye.

1964
01:19:14,010 --> 01:19:18,810
I wanted to

1965
01:19:18,810 --> 01:19:20,810
fucking play!

1966
01:19:20,810 --> 01:19:22,810
I wanted to play

1967
01:19:22,810 --> 01:19:24,810
Money Player!

1968
01:19:24,810 --> 01:19:26,810
I was keeping it so, so

1969
01:19:26,810 --> 01:19:28,810
collected the whole time!

1970
01:19:28,810 --> 01:19:30,810
I just wanted to play Money

1971
01:19:30,810 --> 01:19:32,810
Player with my friend!

1972
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:34,810
Tears are fucking pouring down my face!

1973
01:19:36,810 --> 01:19:40,520
You know how hard it is to contain yourself?

1974
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:42,890
No, that's unfortunate. It really is.

1975
01:19:42,890 --> 01:19:44,890
I thought this was gonna be fixed.

1976
01:19:44,890 --> 01:19:51,220
Uh, Vinny,

1977
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:53,220
Vinny, the great guy.

1978
01:19:53,220 --> 01:19:55,220
Highly recommend

1979
01:19:55,220 --> 01:19:57,399
If you do not follow that stream,

1980
01:19:57,399 --> 01:20:00,729
give it a follow.

1981
01:20:00,729 --> 01:20:02,729
So we can talk about one thing here.

1982
01:20:02,729 --> 01:20:04,729
The plan today

1983
01:20:04,729 --> 01:20:07,289
got a little messed up.

1984
01:20:07,289 --> 01:20:10,739
Vinny and Vine!

1985
01:20:13,689 --> 01:20:18,170
It's apparently been happening all day.

1986
01:20:18,170 --> 01:20:20,170
The plan was

1987
01:20:20,170 --> 01:20:22,170
we were only gonna play this for like

1988
01:20:22,170 --> 01:20:24,539
two or three hours. So

1989
01:20:24,539 --> 01:20:26,710
it's kind of at the point where

1990
01:20:26,710 --> 01:20:28,710
the plan was I was only gonna

1991
01:20:28,710 --> 01:20:30,710
stream for like two or three hours anyways.

1992
01:20:30,710 --> 01:20:32,710
So, I'm sorry guys

1993
01:20:32,710 --> 01:20:34,710
that this kind of in the middle

1994
01:20:34,710 --> 01:20:36,710
extra stream here turned out to be

1995
01:20:36,710 --> 01:20:38,710
a little bit of a uh, you know what I mean?

1996
01:20:41,529 --> 01:20:43,529
For tomorrow, the reason why this stream was

1997
01:20:43,529 --> 01:20:45,529
not gonna be very long is cause I'm going to

1998
01:20:45,529 --> 01:20:47,529
prepare the movie night.

1999
01:20:47,529 --> 01:20:49,529
I wanna make sure it's ready to go. I wanna make sure

2000
01:20:49,529 --> 01:20:51,529
that it is

2001
01:20:51,529 --> 01:20:53,529
uh, perfect.

2002
01:20:53,529 --> 01:20:55,529
There are a lot of submissions,

2003
01:20:55,529 --> 01:20:57,529
there are a lot of, there's a lot of work

2004
01:20:57,529 --> 01:20:59,529
that went into it, so

2005
01:20:59,529 --> 01:21:01,529
the plan was I was gonna only stream for an hour or two

2006
01:21:01,529 --> 01:21:03,529
and I just, I just deleted an hour for some

2007
01:21:03,529 --> 01:21:05,529
reason because it's been an hour or two and I'm just like

2008
01:21:05,529 --> 01:21:07,529
I'm like inceptioning that into your brain that the stream

2009
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:09,529
is only gonna be an hour.

2010
01:21:09,529 --> 01:21:11,529
Um, I'm so excited for it. I'm looking

2011
01:21:11,529 --> 01:21:13,529
forward to it. It's gonna be a lot of fun.

2012
01:21:13,529 --> 01:21:15,529
So, I'm gonna end the stream here.

2013
01:21:15,529 --> 01:21:17,529
Uh, again, I'm sorry

2014
01:21:17,529 --> 01:21:19,529
about the Rockstar servers. I

2015
01:21:19,529 --> 01:21:21,529
really, really thought after a few days it was gonna be

2016
01:21:21,529 --> 01:21:23,529
fixed. So, I'm gonna go

2017
01:21:23,529 --> 01:21:25,529
I'm gonna go fix, uh, not fix

2018
01:21:25,529 --> 01:21:27,529
my internet. I'm

2019
01:21:27,529 --> 01:21:31,180
I'm so used to saying that.

2020
01:21:31,180 --> 01:21:33,180
But, I'm gonna go prepare. I wanna make sure I put a lot of

2021
01:21:33,180 --> 01:21:35,180
time into the movie night.

2022
01:21:35,180 --> 01:21:37,180
So,

2023
01:21:37,180 --> 01:21:39,180
uh, take care.

2024
01:21:39,180 --> 01:21:41,180
I'll go through the bits. It's probably gonna be very quick.

2025
01:21:41,180 --> 01:21:43,930
I'll see you guys tomorrow. If you don't know what I'm talking

2026
01:21:43,930 --> 01:21:45,930
about, we're doing a movie night tomorrow

2027
01:21:45,930 --> 01:21:47,930
where I gave

2028
01:21:47,930 --> 01:21:49,930
uh, like two or three hours of brain-threat

2029
01:21:49,930 --> 01:21:51,930
footage to

2030
01:21:51,930 --> 01:21:53,930
everybody in this entire community

2031
01:21:53,930 --> 01:21:55,930
and some of the incredibly

2032
01:21:55,930 --> 01:21:57,930
talented and creative funny fucking people

2033
01:21:57,930 --> 01:21:59,930
that are here have made some great shit

2034
01:21:59,930 --> 01:22:01,930
to watch tomorrow. In the stream tomorrow,

2035
01:22:01,930 --> 01:22:03,930
probably only gonna be like a couple hours, two or three hours.

2036
01:22:03,930 --> 01:22:05,930
I don't wanna have it over states welcome. I don't want it to be

2037
01:22:05,930 --> 01:22:07,930
one of those scenarios where it's like, alright, we're like

2038
01:22:07,930 --> 01:22:09,930
five hours in and like, here's

2039
01:22:09,930 --> 01:22:11,930
another like me keyed in front of Minecraft.

2040
01:22:11,930 --> 01:22:13,930
Cause, you know,

2041
01:22:13,930 --> 01:22:15,930
it's inevitable.

2042
01:22:15,930 --> 01:22:18,100
But there are a lot of really funny fucking people in this

2043
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:22,649
community. And I'm

2044
01:22:22,649 --> 01:22:24,649
really looking forward to it. It's been in the making

2045
01:22:24,649 --> 01:22:26,649
for like four months. And

2046
01:22:26,649 --> 01:22:28,649
um, just really glad that it's gonna be

2047
01:22:28,649 --> 01:22:30,649
actually a thing we do tomorrow.

2048
01:22:30,649 --> 01:22:32,649
So, let me go.

2049
01:22:32,649 --> 01:22:34,649
Uh, let's do the bits.

2050
01:22:34,649 --> 01:22:36,649
Really quickly.

2051
01:22:36,649 --> 01:22:39,850
If you just showed up.

2052
01:22:39,850 --> 01:22:41,850
Sorry, I didn't even tweet the stream

2053
01:22:41,850 --> 01:22:44,090
out, I'm glad I didn't. Cause

2054
01:22:44,090 --> 01:22:47,020
uh, you know, unfortunately.

2055
01:22:47,020 --> 01:22:51,560
There isn't actually that much

2056
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:53,560
Minecraft. I know, I'm just kidding around.

2057
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:55,989
I'm just playing around. For what was there, I hope you

2058
01:22:55,989 --> 01:22:57,989
enjoyed just hanging out. Cause we kinda just hung out

2059
01:22:57,989 --> 01:22:59,989
and talked about the weather. For like an hour.

2060
01:22:59,989 --> 01:23:02,170
Uh, if Vinny is

2061
01:23:02,170 --> 01:23:04,170
streaming, go watch him. Metallix is streaming, go

2062
01:23:04,170 --> 01:23:06,170
watch him. While I work

2063
01:23:06,170 --> 01:23:08,170
on some stuff.

2064
01:23:08,170 --> 01:23:14,569
What time tomorrow? Tomorrow at 4

2065
01:23:14,569 --> 01:23:16,569
pm pacific time. Is when

2066
01:23:16,569 --> 01:23:18,569
the stream is going to start.

2067
01:23:18,569 --> 01:23:25,670
4 pm pacific.

2068
01:23:25,670 --> 01:23:27,670
Which is 7 pm eastern.

2069
01:23:27,670 --> 01:23:29,670
And I am trying to

2070
01:23:29,670 --> 01:23:32,619
uh, I am trying

2071
01:23:32,619 --> 01:23:34,619
to, cause I've been so used to telling everybody

2072
01:23:34,619 --> 01:23:36,619
times in eastern. And I feel like

2073
01:23:36,619 --> 01:23:38,619
there's a lot of people that still

2074
01:23:38,619 --> 01:23:40,619
um, when I say, oh 4 o'clock!

2075
01:23:40,619 --> 01:23:42,619
A lot of people don't know I mean

2076
01:23:42,619 --> 01:23:44,619
pacific. Cause I've been so,

2077
01:23:44,619 --> 01:23:46,619
it's just, for 3, 4 years

2078
01:23:46,619 --> 01:23:48,619
it's been eastern.

2079
01:23:48,619 --> 01:23:50,619
So, that's why I keep saying the eastern times

2080
01:23:50,619 --> 01:23:54,329
as well. It was fun

2081
01:23:54,329 --> 01:23:56,329
watching you two go off cliffs together.

2082
01:23:56,329 --> 01:23:59,460
It was. But thank you

2083
01:23:59,460 --> 01:24:02,090
uh, thank you again everybody.

2084
01:24:02,090 --> 01:24:04,090
Thank you daf. Skeletor for the

2085
01:24:04,090 --> 01:24:06,090
10 bucks. No message, 10 dollars.

2086
01:24:06,090 --> 01:24:08,090
Uh, coconut, thanks for the 1 buck.

2087
01:24:08,090 --> 01:24:10,090
2 bucks actually, 3 bucks!

2088
01:24:10,090 --> 01:24:12,329
They say uh, plug

2089
01:24:12,329 --> 01:24:15,850
walk. I don't know what that means.

2090
01:24:15,850 --> 01:24:17,850
Thank you Divus for the 5 dollars.

2091
01:24:17,850 --> 01:24:19,850
No message.

2092
01:24:19,850 --> 01:24:21,850
Uh, Hawkeye, thank you Hawkeye

2093
01:24:21,850 --> 01:24:23,850
for the 30 dollars Hawkeye.

2094
01:24:23,850 --> 01:24:26,659
30 bucks, a little more than an hour ago.

2095
01:24:26,659 --> 01:24:32,100
They say, hey there Jerma,

2096
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:34,100
works pretty slow right now. And there's a

2097
01:24:34,100 --> 01:24:36,100
snowstorm outside. So I decided to pop in and

2098
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:38,100
give these that have been meeting to

2099
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:40,100
donate. I work pretty late so I'm resigned

2100
01:24:40,100 --> 01:24:42,100
to be a slimy

2101
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:44,100
vaude boy. But the laughs

2102
01:24:44,100 --> 01:24:46,600
are always well worth it. See you around.

2103
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:48,600
Thank you for the 30 dollars and

2104
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:50,600
slimy vaude

2105
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:54,439
boy. That's

2106
01:24:54,439 --> 01:24:58,729
slimy vaude boy. But thank you

2107
01:24:58,729 --> 01:25:02,310
so much Hawkeye. 30 dollars,

2108
01:25:02,310 --> 01:25:04,310
lots of money. Sorry that the stream

2109
01:25:04,310 --> 01:25:06,489
that you gave that money on was

2110
01:25:06,489 --> 01:25:08,489
uh, not even, I would even

2111
01:25:08,489 --> 01:25:10,489
not even classify the, it's been

2112
01:25:10,489 --> 01:25:12,489
like an hour and a half.

2113
01:25:12,489 --> 01:25:15,050
Um, don't worry. We got tomorrow

2114
01:25:15,050 --> 01:25:17,050
night, we got a very very good

2115
01:25:17,050 --> 01:25:19,050
fun stream ready to go. So

2116
01:25:19,050 --> 01:25:21,050
thank you. Thank you Garf for the

2117
01:25:21,050 --> 01:25:23,050
Monday killer for the one dollar. My name is Garf and I'm here

2118
01:25:23,050 --> 01:25:25,050
to say I eat lasagna every day.

2119
01:25:25,050 --> 01:25:27,050
Yo yo Jerma, it's Garf the rapper here.

2120
01:25:27,050 --> 01:25:29,050
I'm hoping to reboot my rap career.

2121
01:25:29,050 --> 01:25:31,050
Yes there's a six minute Garfield rap in the

2122
01:25:31,050 --> 01:25:33,050
early 90s. Uh, speaking of reinventing

2123
01:25:33,050 --> 01:25:35,050
your image, have you heard of those two Shrek

2124
01:25:35,050 --> 01:25:37,050
remakes? Well you just said Shrek so

2125
01:25:37,050 --> 01:25:39,859
I'm censoring the rest of this comment.

2126
01:25:39,859 --> 01:25:41,859
Won by the guy who made the minions and the

2127
01:25:41,859 --> 01:25:44,039
fan made one. The fan

2128
01:25:44,039 --> 01:25:46,039
made one called Shrek retold was

2129
01:25:46,039 --> 01:25:49,109
released two days ago. Every scene is

2130
01:25:49,109 --> 01:25:52,060
directed by a different artist. What movie would you

2131
01:25:52,060 --> 01:25:54,060
want remade by fans?

2132
01:25:54,060 --> 01:26:00,819
Um, I don't

2133
01:26:00,819 --> 01:26:03,449
know. Probably

2134
01:26:03,449 --> 01:26:06,579
maybe you could try

2135
01:26:06,579 --> 01:26:08,579
Why am I taking this comment seriously? Uh,

2136
01:26:08,579 --> 01:26:12,039
what movie? I would

2137
01:26:12,039 --> 01:26:16,460
say, uh, crocodile

2138
01:26:16,460 --> 01:26:19,140
Dundee. There's some stuff

2139
01:26:19,140 --> 01:26:21,510
there that could be done maybe. Uh, thank you

2140
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:23,510
Jess for the one dollar. When I was a kid I used

2141
01:26:23,510 --> 01:26:26,890
to say, uh,

2142
01:26:26,890 --> 01:26:28,890
Chay Kane instead of Keychain.

2143
01:26:28,890 --> 01:26:30,890
I couldn't shake it for years. I would

2144
01:26:30,890 --> 01:26:32,890
also say sunshine

2145
01:26:32,890 --> 01:26:34,890
every time. I remember this. I can't say it

2146
01:26:34,890 --> 01:26:36,890
normally for days after.

2147
01:26:36,890 --> 01:26:38,890
Cheshire Trust. It's a Cheshire

2148
01:26:38,890 --> 01:26:40,890
Trust at this point. It's not a treasure chest.

2149
01:26:40,890 --> 01:26:44,920
It's hard to say it the other way.

2150
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:46,920
But thank you. Thank you ExtraCheesy for the one dollar. He says

2151
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:48,920
he doesn't eat, but yeah, the whole

2152
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:51,800
taquitos things. Uh, ExtraCheesy

2153
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:53,800
thanks again for the ten dollars here. Here's

2154
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:55,800
what you said you never did before.

2155
01:26:55,800 --> 01:27:09,819
What the hell is this? I'm

2156
01:27:09,819 --> 01:27:13,399
eating taco

2157
01:27:13,399 --> 01:27:15,399
You drive dude. I'm eating.

2158
01:27:15,399 --> 01:27:18,220
That's not even me. Four?

2159
01:27:18,220 --> 01:27:22,380
Eat four taquitos at the same time.

2160
01:27:22,380 --> 01:27:24,380
Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2161
01:27:24,380 --> 01:27:26,619
When did I do this?

2162
01:27:26,619 --> 01:27:30,260
I don't remember putting

2163
01:27:30,260 --> 01:27:32,260
like five fucking taquitos in my mouth.

2164
01:27:32,260 --> 01:27:35,720
Hold on a second.

2165
01:27:51,130 --> 01:27:55,159
This is one of the last streams before I left.

2166
01:27:55,159 --> 01:27:57,159
Oh. Oh, okay.

2167
01:27:57,159 --> 01:28:00,939
You drive dude. I'm eating.

2168
01:28:00,939 --> 01:28:04,140
Four? One, two,

2169
01:28:04,140 --> 01:28:06,630
three, four. I don't

2170
01:28:06,630 --> 01:28:08,630
do this, do I? This is a joke, right?

2171
01:28:08,630 --> 01:28:12,659
I'm not doing it.

2172
01:28:12,659 --> 01:28:22,010
I knew it.

2173
01:28:22,010 --> 01:28:24,010
I knew it. I knew I wasn't

2174
01:28:24,010 --> 01:28:26,180
gonna do it. We got a helicopter

2175
01:28:26,180 --> 01:28:28,180
dude. We got a helicopter. Okay

2176
01:28:28,180 --> 01:28:30,180
I've had enough of that.

2177
01:28:34,899 --> 01:28:36,899
I thought you guys were talking about Vinny.

2178
01:28:39,850 --> 01:28:42,539
I've never eaten a taquito

2179
01:28:42,539 --> 01:28:44,539
in my life.

2180
01:28:44,539 --> 01:28:47,479
It's so funny cause that was

2181
01:28:47,479 --> 01:28:49,479
that wasn't like five years ago

2182
01:28:49,479 --> 01:28:51,479
that wasn't like three years ago. That was like

2183
01:28:51,479 --> 01:28:53,479
two months ago.

2184
01:28:56,409 --> 01:29:01,079
Oh

2185
01:29:03,079 --> 01:29:05,079
How do you guys remember these things?

2186
01:29:05,079 --> 01:29:07,079
Good thing you keep me honest.

2187
01:29:07,079 --> 01:29:09,510
But thank you Extra Cheesy for that.

2188
01:29:09,510 --> 01:29:11,510
Ten dollars, eleven dollars, twelve dollars.

2189
01:29:11,510 --> 01:29:13,510
And I want

2190
01:29:13,510 --> 01:29:15,819
the red badge. Thank you

2191
01:29:15,819 --> 01:29:18,310
Extra Cheesy. Red badge.

2192
01:29:18,310 --> 01:29:20,310
Mark Bosh Magali

2193
01:29:20,310 --> 01:29:22,310
thanks for the one dollar. The disconnect joke was really

2194
01:29:22,310 --> 01:29:24,310
interesting. Not sure what you were trying to accomplish.

2195
01:29:24,310 --> 01:29:26,310
Either way, it was nice seeing you

2196
01:29:26,310 --> 01:29:28,310
with Vinny. Take care.

2197
01:29:28,310 --> 01:29:30,310
The disconnecting from

2198
01:29:30,310 --> 01:29:33,319
the game joke. That's too

2199
01:29:33,319 --> 01:29:36,390
bad. That's too

2200
01:29:36,390 --> 01:29:40,359
bad. But

2201
01:29:40,359 --> 01:29:42,359
I would be more upset about this

2202
01:29:42,359 --> 01:29:44,359
if, cause I know that he

2203
01:29:44,359 --> 01:29:47,239
when we talked about doing this he was like

2204
01:29:47,239 --> 01:29:49,239
oh let's do this. This sounds like fun. Like let's give

2205
01:29:49,239 --> 01:29:51,239
it a few days though cause there's internet problems. There's like

2206
01:29:51,239 --> 01:29:53,239
Rockstar servers are kinda fucked up or whatever

2207
01:29:53,239 --> 01:29:55,420
right. I'm just glad that he

2208
01:29:55,420 --> 01:29:57,420
was already streaming something. He was doing

2209
01:29:57,420 --> 01:29:59,420
something. This wasn't like a okay

2210
01:29:59,420 --> 01:30:01,420
here's the stream for today.

2211
01:30:01,420 --> 01:30:03,420
He had already been playing like Ocarina of Time

2212
01:30:03,420 --> 01:30:05,420
and I'm really glad that it wasn't

2213
01:30:05,420 --> 01:30:07,420
just like oh hey let's just

2214
01:30:07,420 --> 01:30:09,420
let's just ruin this stream.

2215
01:30:09,420 --> 01:30:12,470
So. And

2216
01:30:12,470 --> 01:30:14,470
on this end at least that this was

2217
01:30:14,470 --> 01:30:16,470
an in between to tomorrow.

2218
01:30:16,470 --> 01:30:18,470
And we streamed yesterday, streamed tomorrow

2219
01:30:18,470 --> 01:30:20,470
and I'm just glad that this wasn't

2220
01:30:20,470 --> 01:30:22,470
you know oh that's it.

2221
01:30:22,470 --> 01:30:26,180
Red dead connection.

2222
01:30:26,180 --> 01:30:30,729
Yeah. Sorry

2223
01:30:30,729 --> 01:30:32,729
again everybody. I wish

2224
01:30:32,729 --> 01:30:34,729
I could snap my fingers and magically

2225
01:30:34,729 --> 01:30:36,729
have it not happen but

2226
01:30:36,729 --> 01:30:38,729
I'm actually going to do a little bit of research

2227
01:30:38,729 --> 01:30:40,729
because the stuff that I read

2228
01:30:40,729 --> 01:30:42,729
about it there's like workarounds

2229
01:30:42,729 --> 01:30:44,729
and I tried the workarounds

2230
01:30:44,729 --> 01:30:46,729
already. They didn't work.

2231
01:30:46,729 --> 01:30:49,100
But maybe there's some other things to try.

2232
01:30:49,100 --> 01:30:51,720
But thank you Marvish

2233
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:53,720
Magali. Thank you Hunter Kane for the one dollar. Have some

2234
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:56,220
bits. Thanks. Mostly lost thanks for

2235
01:30:56,220 --> 01:30:58,220
the one dollar. You should host Vinny or

2236
01:30:58,220 --> 01:31:00,220
Italics. You do know how the host button works right?

2237
01:31:00,220 --> 01:31:02,970
I don't know what

2238
01:31:02,970 --> 01:31:04,970
you mean like they

2239
01:31:04,970 --> 01:31:07,720
appear like I hope

2240
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:09,720
they appear inside of me.

2241
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:17,060
What do you mean? Like I have to

2242
01:31:17,060 --> 01:31:19,060
be inside. That's like a that's like a tapeworm.

2243
01:31:19,060 --> 01:31:24,380
I don't think I want that.

2244
01:31:24,380 --> 01:31:26,380
That's how the movie Venom starts.

2245
01:31:26,380 --> 01:31:31,689
I don't think I want that.

2246
01:31:31,689 --> 01:31:33,689
Ha ha ha ha ha

2247
01:31:33,689 --> 01:31:37,079
ha ha. Hey thank you

2248
01:31:37,079 --> 01:31:39,079
D Jack for the one dollar. I rewatched the Zoo Tycoon stream

2249
01:31:39,079 --> 01:31:41,079
and nearly shit myself with the T-Rex not being

2250
01:31:41,079 --> 01:31:43,079
able to find his car joke. Keep bringing

2251
01:31:43,079 --> 01:31:47,500
the chuckles. Thank you D Jack.

2252
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:51,140
It was a fun stream. Spoilers.

2253
01:31:51,140 --> 01:31:53,140
Oh sorry. Sorry guys.

2254
01:31:53,140 --> 01:31:56,149
Venom is a symbiote. Sorry.

2255
01:31:56,149 --> 01:31:58,149
Sorry for the spoils.

2256
01:31:58,149 --> 01:32:00,149
And Smelly Boy right at the end. When are you going to play

2257
01:32:00,149 --> 01:32:02,149
Metal Gear Rising? Tomorrow.

2258
01:32:02,149 --> 01:32:04,149
No it's a lie. I'm kidding. Not tomorrow.

2259
01:32:04,149 --> 01:32:06,329
Tomorrow we're doing the...

2260
01:32:06,329 --> 01:32:13,689
No. Tomorrow we're doing the movie night.

2261
01:32:13,689 --> 01:32:19,380
How long is the stream going to be

2262
01:32:19,380 --> 01:32:22,010
tomorrow? That's up

2263
01:32:22,010 --> 01:32:24,010
for potential debate because

2264
01:32:24,010 --> 01:32:26,180
after I turn the stream off

2265
01:32:26,180 --> 01:32:28,180
here I'm going to go to the bathroom.

2266
01:32:28,180 --> 01:32:30,180
I'm going to go grab a drink and then sit down

2267
01:32:30,180 --> 01:32:32,180
and really get it hammered out.

2268
01:32:32,180 --> 01:32:34,810
And I don't know.

2269
01:32:34,810 --> 01:32:36,810
I'm going to assume it's going to be

2270
01:32:36,810 --> 01:32:38,810
like less than two or three hours long.

2271
01:32:38,810 --> 01:32:41,239
Because we're just going to be watching a playlist.

2272
01:32:41,239 --> 01:32:43,239
We're watching a huge community

2273
01:32:43,239 --> 01:32:47,899
playlist. So

2274
01:32:47,899 --> 01:32:51,989
I'm going to assume up to three hours.

2275
01:32:51,989 --> 01:32:55,319
It's one minute max. Two minutes max.

2276
01:32:55,319 --> 01:32:57,319
I plan on, I'm just going to tell you

2277
01:32:57,319 --> 01:32:59,319
just a fair warning, I plan on drinking a little bit

2278
01:32:59,319 --> 01:33:01,939
of wine. This is the sun.

2279
01:33:01,939 --> 01:33:03,939
It's been a couple of, it's been like two or three

2280
01:33:03,939 --> 01:33:06,569
weeks since I've had some good wine.

2281
01:33:06,569 --> 01:33:11,539
It's going to be a red blend.

2282
01:33:11,539 --> 01:33:13,539
But that is

2283
01:33:13,539 --> 01:33:15,539
it. Here come the credits

2284
01:33:15,539 --> 01:33:17,539
for the short stream that was

2285
01:33:17,539 --> 01:33:19,979
here. Thank you for

2286
01:33:19,979 --> 01:33:21,979
subscribing and contributing

2287
01:33:21,979 --> 01:33:23,979
everybody. It means a lot.

2288
01:33:23,979 --> 01:33:27,430
I wish it was better circumstances.

2289
01:33:27,430 --> 01:33:30,500
He's going to eat food and forget.

2290
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:36,329
And there's also

2291
01:33:36,329 --> 01:33:38,329
a very, very real

2292
01:33:38,329 --> 01:33:41,460
possibility where the

2293
01:33:41,460 --> 01:33:43,770
it's broken up into two nights.

2294
01:33:43,770 --> 01:33:47,399
You know what I mean? Because if

2295
01:33:47,399 --> 01:33:49,399
there are, if there's more than four

2296
01:33:49,399 --> 01:33:51,399
or five hours of

2297
01:33:51,399 --> 01:33:54,020
videos to watch, then it might,

2298
01:33:54,020 --> 01:33:56,020
it'll be better probably to break it up into two

2299
01:33:56,020 --> 01:34:05,109
separate occasions. It depends.

2300
01:34:05,109 --> 01:34:07,109
I mean, maybe we'll just do the whole thing. It really depends

2301
01:34:07,109 --> 01:34:09,109
on how long the whole, after going

2302
01:34:09,109 --> 01:34:11,289
through and

2303
01:34:11,289 --> 01:34:13,289
making sure that it's cleaned up

2304
01:34:13,289 --> 01:34:15,289
and some duplicates are removed

2305
01:34:15,289 --> 01:34:17,289
or ones that weren't

2306
01:34:17,289 --> 01:34:19,289
following the rules or ones that just didn't make

2307
01:34:19,289 --> 01:34:21,289
any sense. Once it's cleaned up a little

2308
01:34:21,289 --> 01:34:34,920
bit, we'll find out. I can watch it at

2309
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:36,920
times two speed.

2310
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:41,060
Don't

2311
01:34:41,060 --> 01:34:43,060
watch them. What do you mean don't watch them?

2312
01:34:43,060 --> 01:34:45,880
Ones that don't make any sense.

2313
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:47,880
Here's what I'm talking about. If there's like

2314
01:34:47,880 --> 01:34:50,250
we need to shave time off,

2315
01:34:50,250 --> 01:34:52,250
here's the reason why these all had to

2316
01:34:52,250 --> 01:34:54,250
be screened and had to be

2317
01:34:54,250 --> 01:34:56,250
predetermined if they were

2318
01:34:56,250 --> 01:34:58,250
capable of being on. Because the rules

2319
01:34:58,250 --> 01:35:00,250
that I set forth were original

2320
01:35:00,250 --> 01:35:02,250
content encouraged,

2321
01:35:02,250 --> 01:35:04,250
more than 10 seconds, less than two minutes,

2322
01:35:04,250 --> 01:35:06,250
like give or take

2323
01:35:06,250 --> 01:35:08,250
some people, if you go over by

2324
01:35:08,250 --> 01:35:10,250
five seconds or so, like okay,

2325
01:35:10,250 --> 01:35:12,250
as long as, or ten seconds, whatever,

2326
01:35:12,250 --> 01:35:14,250
if the video was made well,

2327
01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:16,250
we're just trying to see how that works.

2328
01:35:16,250 --> 01:35:18,250
But, there weren't very many

2329
01:35:18,250 --> 01:35:20,250
other rules

2330
01:35:20,250 --> 01:35:22,250
in regards to, well, I mean, obviously there was no

2331
01:35:22,250 --> 01:35:24,250
hateful shit, there was no sexual stuff,

2332
01:35:24,250 --> 01:35:26,250
obviously. But,

2333
01:35:26,250 --> 01:35:28,250
the reason why we have to go through them all

2334
01:35:28,250 --> 01:35:30,250
is because somebody could just put up

2335
01:35:30,250 --> 01:35:32,250
hey, here's my, here's my submission

2336
01:35:32,250 --> 01:35:34,250
and it's a minute and 58 seconds

2337
01:35:34,250 --> 01:35:36,250
of a black screen and then it flashes me

2338
01:35:36,250 --> 01:35:38,250
on the screen for one second.

2339
01:35:38,250 --> 01:35:40,250
That one's not going on, we're not putting

2340
01:35:40,250 --> 01:35:42,250
that one on the video, you know what I mean? That's not going on.

2341
01:35:42,250 --> 01:35:45,449
Like, that shit's not going on.

2342
01:35:45,449 --> 01:35:47,619
That's just a waste of time,

2343
01:35:47,619 --> 01:35:49,619
you know what I mean? Time is of the essence

2344
01:35:49,619 --> 01:35:55,579
tomorrow. And so, there's been

2345
01:35:55,579 --> 01:35:57,579
a few submissions that have

2346
01:35:57,579 --> 01:35:59,579
just been, just absolute,

2347
01:35:59,579 --> 01:36:01,579
just carnage,

2348
01:36:01,579 --> 01:36:03,579
just keyed out, just

2349
01:36:03,579 --> 01:36:05,579
volume at max,

2350
01:36:05,579 --> 01:36:07,579
blasting music, and just

2351
01:36:07,579 --> 01:36:09,579
like, and every one of the

2352
01:36:09,579 --> 01:36:11,579
green screens just like flying around and stuff.

2353
01:36:11,579 --> 01:36:13,579
For like two minutes.

2354
01:36:13,579 --> 01:36:16,260
It's like,

2355
01:36:16,260 --> 01:36:18,260
there's been some wild submissions,

2356
01:36:18,260 --> 01:36:20,260
so we need to make sure that we have

2357
01:36:20,260 --> 01:36:22,260
ones that aren't going to be obviously,

2358
01:36:22,260 --> 01:36:24,260
you know, blow anybody's ears out.

2359
01:36:24,260 --> 01:36:31,109
That sounds amazing.

2360
01:36:31,109 --> 01:36:33,109
And if, yo, I didn't say there was

2361
01:36:33,109 --> 01:36:35,109
anything wrong with it, but for the purposes of

2362
01:36:35,109 --> 01:36:37,109
tomorrow's viewing,

2363
01:36:37,109 --> 01:36:39,609
it needs to be at least fairly

2364
01:36:39,609 --> 01:36:50,100
structured. I've

2365
01:36:50,100 --> 01:36:52,100
I've tried to abstain from watching as many

2366
01:36:52,100 --> 01:36:54,100
of them as I can, but there are a lot of occasions

2367
01:36:54,100 --> 01:36:56,100
where I do have to watch them,

2368
01:36:56,100 --> 01:36:58,100
because I'm not sure, is this one okay?

2369
01:36:58,100 --> 01:37:00,100
Is this one kind of pushing the line

2370
01:37:00,100 --> 01:37:02,100
a little bit, and I have to watch them. I have to watch

2371
01:37:02,100 --> 01:37:04,100
a lot of them, pretty much.

2372
01:37:04,100 --> 01:37:06,100
But, because there's been

2373
01:37:06,100 --> 01:37:08,100
the mod team has been doing an absolutely

2374
01:37:08,100 --> 01:37:10,100
fucking fantastic job

2375
01:37:10,100 --> 01:37:12,340
to keep this

2376
01:37:12,340 --> 01:37:14,340
where I don't see very many

2377
01:37:14,340 --> 01:37:18,380
of them, you know what I mean?

2378
01:37:18,380 --> 01:37:20,380
But they do need to be watched, and I go, alright, I don't know about

2379
01:37:20,380 --> 01:37:25,939
that. Have somebody watch them for you.

2380
01:37:25,939 --> 01:37:27,939
That is essentially

2381
01:37:27,939 --> 01:37:33,770
what the mods have been doing.

2382
01:37:33,770 --> 01:37:36,010
It's been a huge fucking help.

2383
01:37:36,010 --> 01:37:38,010
That they deserve praise, they deserve

2384
01:37:38,010 --> 01:37:40,010
all the love you can give them.

2385
01:37:40,010 --> 01:37:45,180
And they deserve

2386
01:37:45,180 --> 01:37:49,850
compensation.

2387
01:37:49,850 --> 01:37:54,520
Because that's a lot of work. Especially this.

2388
01:37:54,520 --> 01:38:01,180
Yeah, coming, bits coming

2389
01:38:01,180 --> 01:38:08,659
your way.

2390
01:38:08,659 --> 01:38:10,659
Because, I mean, I'll be real here for a minute.

2391
01:38:10,659 --> 01:38:12,659
There's been occasions where

2392
01:38:12,659 --> 01:38:16,119
you know, you just can't do

2393
01:38:16,119 --> 01:38:18,739
it alone, you know what I mean?

2394
01:38:18,739 --> 01:38:20,739
There's been at least three or four streams that

2395
01:38:20,739 --> 01:38:23,609
just

2396
01:38:23,609 --> 01:38:25,609
without the help of at least

2397
01:38:25,609 --> 01:38:27,609
three, four of these mods.

2398
01:38:27,609 --> 01:38:29,609
There's no way that the streams would have even been

2399
01:38:29,609 --> 01:38:31,609
in reality, never would have been in reality, ever.

2400
01:38:31,609 --> 01:38:35,819
So, big thanks.

2401
01:38:35,819 --> 01:38:42,539
In reality.

2402
01:38:42,539 --> 01:38:45,989
And thank you all the subs, everybody

2403
01:38:45,989 --> 01:38:49,130
that just came in. Get excited for tomorrow,

2404
01:38:49,130 --> 01:39:00,649
it's gonna be a lot of fun. And finally,

2405
01:39:00,649 --> 01:39:02,649
right at the very end,

2406
01:39:02,649 --> 01:39:04,649
we had mostly lost

2407
01:39:04,649 --> 01:39:06,649
with the dollar. Also, thanks to you, I'm never gonna be able to drink

2408
01:39:06,649 --> 01:39:08,649
a red blend again without laughing.

2409
01:39:08,649 --> 01:39:10,649
Oh, come on, it's the best. It's the best.

2410
01:39:10,649 --> 01:39:13,659
I should have asked, I should have asked

2411
01:39:13,659 --> 01:39:16,149
a video about that. He would know.

2412
01:39:16,149 --> 01:39:18,149
He would be like, yeah, of course.

2413
01:39:18,149 --> 01:39:20,899
Mr. Picklesworth, thanks for the one dollar.

2414
01:39:20,899 --> 01:39:22,899
Hey, Jerma, how you doing today? I think I got banned from the discord

2415
01:39:22,899 --> 01:39:24,899
because I said, give,

2416
01:39:24,899 --> 01:39:28,489
I give back

2417
01:39:28,489 --> 01:39:30,489
a couple of times in the chat

2418
01:39:30,489 --> 01:39:32,489
when you took away the image posting.

2419
01:39:32,489 --> 01:39:34,979
Sorry, if my messages were spammy.

2420
01:39:34,979 --> 01:39:37,670
Hit up one of the

2421
01:39:37,670 --> 01:39:39,670
mods in a private message.

2422
01:39:39,670 --> 01:39:41,670
They will take care of it. They will

2423
01:39:41,670 --> 01:39:43,670
just, they will take a look and see what happened.

2424
01:39:43,670 --> 01:39:50,460
I hope it's not too late for you to see this.

2425
01:39:50,460 --> 01:39:55,939
No. And just

2426
01:39:55,939 --> 01:39:57,939
also remember something.

2427
01:39:57,939 --> 01:39:59,939
If somebody gets from the discord

2428
01:39:59,939 --> 01:40:01,939
or in this channel,

2429
01:40:01,939 --> 01:40:03,939
if you get like banned,

2430
01:40:03,939 --> 01:40:06,890
for the, all

2431
01:40:06,890 --> 01:40:08,890
bans, like permanent, we're talking like

2432
01:40:08,890 --> 01:40:11,130
bans, are

2433
01:40:11,130 --> 01:40:13,130
discussed. And it's not just like, hey,

2434
01:40:13,130 --> 01:40:16,579
you got banned. And there's usually

2435
01:40:16,579 --> 01:40:18,579
a dialogue you can open up to

2436
01:40:18,579 --> 01:40:20,579
potentially talk about what happened

2437
01:40:20,579 --> 01:40:22,819
or why or

2438
01:40:22,819 --> 01:40:30,949
that does happen. So

2439
01:40:30,949 --> 01:40:32,949
all hands are disgust.

2440
01:40:32,949 --> 01:40:41,529
Can I negotiate

2441
01:40:41,529 --> 01:40:43,529
why I should be banned? You could, yeah.

2442
01:40:43,529 --> 01:40:46,539
You could. If you really

2443
01:40:46,539 --> 01:40:51,590
wanted to. But that's going to be

2444
01:40:51,590 --> 01:40:53,770
it. See you guys tomorrow.

2445
01:40:53,770 --> 01:40:57,220
Four p.m. Pacific. I'm excited.

2446
01:40:57,220 --> 01:40:59,220
You're excited. We're all excited.

2447
01:40:59,220 --> 01:41:02,619
Have a wonderful rest of your evening.

2448
01:41:02,619 --> 01:41:05,819
Sorry again

2449
01:41:05,819 --> 01:41:08,119
for Rockstar's servers

2450
01:41:08,119 --> 01:41:10,920
not working. Good night.

2451
01:41:10,920 --> 01:41:14,039
Take care. See you tomorrow.
