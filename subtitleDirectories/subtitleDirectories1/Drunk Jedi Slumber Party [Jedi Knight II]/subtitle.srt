1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:07,299
What an awful name. All right, save her color. I want that to be green like Luke Skywalker.

2
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,890
All right, let's see if there's any weirder ones.

3
00:00:11,689 --> 00:00:21,579
This guy's all ugly. I think it's gonna be that guy. What is this like photoshopped Darth Vader?

4
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,440
This guy looks like somebody photoshopped Darth Vader's face on like a cookie.

5
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,020
Where I don't- where are you? You're not even in here. Oh, there you are.

6
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,100
Yeah

7
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,960
Oh damn, how are you still alive?

8
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:59,320
That's not how this game works. This is fucking bullshit. Why are you still alive? That's not how this game works.

9
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,399
What do you mean? That's not how the game works. I was putting a lightsaber through your body and you would stand-

10
00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:07,049
I just feel like we're both shit faced.

11
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:15,319
Did we both- did we both share a bottle of Jameson before we decided to play this? Like seriously.

12
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,879
All right, this is- this is stupid.

13
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,670
This is stupid.

14
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:27,269
All right, can we go into like an actual server now and no more- like

15
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,579
No, get out of here with that stupid move.

16
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,420
Do it

17
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:50,280
Oh, yeah, hey mace Windu is in this game. You better be careful. I think these are bots.

18
00:01:51,719 --> 00:02:00,340
Probably. Who's playing this game? Emperor Palpatine, Bidu, Lieutenant Cable, Leia, Mace Windu. Yeah, these are fucking bots.

19
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,019
Okay. All right. Well, you ready to get your ass kicked by bots?

20
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:07,780
We're- yeah, we're the only people who readied up just there. Yeah. What?

21
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:09,860
What?

22
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,379
Why did this just turn into a first-person shooter? Because you have a gun now.

23
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,650
You don't start with a lightsaber. Why is it an FPS?

24
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:26,009
Who am I supposed to be shooting? Is it- are you guys shooting? No, we're leaving. This is- this is a bad server.

25
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,710
Is this me and you just like standing at the side watching this?

26
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:34,949
Can I get this thing off my screen? This like message for the day?

27
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:38,150
I wanna-

28
00:02:38,389 --> 00:02:40,389
This is stupid.

29
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,240
Who's this lady in like the pajamas?

30
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,219
Is that like Princess Leia? Well, I don't remember playing Princess Leia wearing like a nightie.

31
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:01,659
How does this guy have negative one?

32
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,699
This is so stupid. This isn't how the game is supposed to work.

33
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:11,580
Oh.

34
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,659
It just spawned us all in this courtyard.

35
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:17,580
There are legitimate game modes where you can have like guns and fight people with lightsabers.

36
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,659
No, screw that. I want to play like the pajama pillow fight mode like this.

37
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:30,710
I'm fairly certain. This is not what a Jedi master fight looks like.

38
00:03:31,909 --> 00:03:37,509
I don't think this is what it looks like when people become Jedi's and fight each other.

39
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,710
I don't.

40
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,340
What else can you say?

41
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:47,419
This is real, real dumb.

42
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:55,590
Are you just like standing back watching? Yeah, I don't even like want to get in there.

43
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:00,150
This guy with the green saber is freaking the fuck out.

44
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:12,469
I'm wondering why this isn't a one-shot kill. I thought maybe the shift was necessary. I'm curious if I can just walk through here.

45
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:28,069
This guy's like freaking. This guy wants to kill us so bad, but he can't kill us.

46
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:48,540
This is not right. This just shouldn't be a thing. All right, can somebody please win?

47
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,420
Ew.

48
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,459
Oh, you're gross. All right, well you want to get this guy?

49
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,579
Watch out for this guy.

50
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:04,540
Did you just see?

51
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,920
I don't.

52
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
What even just happened?

53
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:14,040
I've got pushed off somehow. So did I. We both got like thrown off.

54
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:16,680
I'm surprised

55
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,339
and appalled.

56
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:23,899
I gotta end it on the backstab technique. That's I have to end this video on the backstab technique. Have to.

57
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:27,699
You taught it to me. It has to be done.

58
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:36,199
Come on. I have to end the video on the backstab.

59
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,639
This guy's trying to do it too.

60
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,680
I just don't.

61
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:52,519
That's not happening.

62
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,220
Remember all that training we did guys?

63
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:05,100
Let's just freak the fuck out and swing around in circles at each other.

64
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,439
Jedis, we're Jedi masters.
