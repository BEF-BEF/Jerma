00:00:02,359 --> 00:00:07,879
Hello, and welcome to Jerma's first ever Spooky Trivia Night.

00:00:08,919 --> 00:00:16,280
I'm your host Shannon Sharon, and you're you're involved tonight as well here at home. We have you here on chat

3
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:24,660
So you'll be answering some of our questions. Let's go ahead and introduce our guests over here. We have first up Jerma

4
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,370
That's me, Jerma985. Y'all know who I am. Do I need an introduction?

5
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:35,329
I'm going to destroy. This is trivia round, which you're involved in. By the way, happy Halloween. Those of you that are having parties

6
00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:43,310
Hope you have fun. I mean, I'm stuck here doing trivia, but I plan on destroying. I plan on doing very well. This is you guys here

7
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:49,270
This is chat. That's you. I feel like I'm gonna be I feel pretty confident. I do really do.

8
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:55,590
I'm glad that you feel that way. Let's see what the board says afterwards. Yeah. So secondly, we have you here, chat

9
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:01,820
You can see yourselves. Smile and wave, boys. And lastly, welcome back, Dr. Schmortsen. How are you doing tonight?

10
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:08,920
Absolutely wonderful. Thank you, Sharon. I'm so glad to hear that. I hope you're having a spooky day. Very spooky.

11
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:16,159
I got scared in the car. Did I tell you that? That's concerning. What happened? I don't remember. Oh, they took my memories.

12
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:21,200
They? There was multiple. It was like 30. I mean, that's fine. It was very strange.

13
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:30,739
Are we even live? Oh, we are. Okay. Hey, welcome everybody. Welcome to the trivia section. So, uh, how we do this?

14
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,040
How do we do this? All right. Well, let's introduce our first categories here today.

15
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,700
Here are today's categories.

16
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:39,680
We have

17
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,719
17th century poetry. That's a good one. Super good. My favorite.

18
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:53,489
Oh, I need to change this. By the way, if you're having a Halloween party right now, pump up the music.

19
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:58,290
No, no, actually turn the music down because you want to be able to hear us. You want to be able to hear what we're doing.

20
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:02,810
So again, here we are with today's categories. First off, we have

21
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:08,340
17th century poetry. Okay. Next up, wide open space.

22
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:17,960
Interesting. Thirdly, Goosebumps books part one. Yes. He's pumped. Water, water,

23
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:27,340
everywhere. To be or not to be. Sounds pretty good. And lastly,

24
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,439
spooky things. No. All right.

25
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,870
Now, uh. Because it's Halloween, right?

26
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:37,430
Jerma, as this is your show, would you like to kick us off here? I get to go first?

27
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:43,990
Yeah, you do. All right. Well, I think I'll take 17th century poetry for 50, please. All right.

28
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:50,729
Let's uh, let's see what we got here. John Calvin crafted this Christian

29
00:02:52,050 --> 00:03:03,719
Ideology stressing God's power and the moral weakness of human beings that many of the era's poets followed. Uh, what is?

30
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:14,610
Dr. Strange. I have no idea. Times up. All right, Dr. Schmoyzen. What do you got for us? Yes, Shannon.

31
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,610
It's what is

32
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,789
Calvinism. Why is that?

33
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:22,469
Congratulations, Dr. Schmoyzen. You have won the first points of the evening.

34
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:30,389
Uh, and uh, you know, as the rules of our super generic non-trademark finding show goes, you get to pick the next category.

35
00:03:30,389 --> 00:03:33,360
What would you like to go for? I will continue with

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:42,289
17th century poetry, please for 200. 200. All right. Let's uh, let's start racking up these points here. Now,

37
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:48,129
followers of Ben Johnson touted themselves as this family-oriented namesake.

38
00:03:52,639 --> 00:04:00,639
Who are the sons of Ben? Well done. All right. Sons of Ben. Okay, the sons of Ben. Pretty good job.

39
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:12,449
Appreciate the nice work. Yeah, got some. All right. So now we're at a 250 solid points category.

40
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:19,439
How about Shannon wide open spaces for 400, please. All right, Dr. Schmoyzen.

41
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:23,250
Let's uh, let's see what's in this category. Let's open up this box.

42
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:28,449
This curious individual was the first person to ever look through at the moon through a telescope.

43
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:40,240
Uh, uh, uh, who is Thomas Harriot? Thomas Harriot? Who is Thomas Harriot? Yes, that would be the correct answer.

44
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,680
Thank you, Dr. Schmoyzen. That was Galileo. Wasn't it Galileo?

45
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,800
I'm, uh, not sure that Wikipedia would agree with you. Is that even correct? Apologies for this. That's not even correct.

46
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:56,000
That's not a correct answer. That's Galileo was the first person, wasn't it? That is right. Who the fuck is Thomas Harriot?

47
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:01,600
How do you, why do you know that? I guess he's a damn, he's a goddamn doctor. What am I talking about? Go on.

48
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:06,399
All right. Sorry about that, Dr. Schmoyzen. We have a little bit of a rowdy crowd this evening. It wasn't Galileo.

49
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,519
Uh, would you, uh, like to take us to the next question?

50
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:16,000
Yes, please. Uh, 17th century poetry once again for 400, please.

51
00:05:16,779 --> 00:05:27,300
400. All right. A religious allegory by John Bunyan, which has never been out of print and was the first ever novel written in English.

52
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:34,319
What is Pilgrim's Progress?

53
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,300
What is the Pilgrim's Progress?

54
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,459
Well done.

55
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:44,339
Can I? Yes, Sheremo. How many of these are you going to get right? Can I answer a question? Is that possible?

56
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:50,149
Well, if you could get one right, yes. Well, I didn't, I got the first one wrong, but all right, go ahead. Keep going.

57
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:53,839
All right. Dr. Schmoyzen, take us back.

58
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:59,459
Surely. Um, let's go with wide open spaces for 800, please.

59
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:07,300
All right. Wide open spaces for 800. Measuring at negative 240 degrees Celsius.

60
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:11,060
This is the coldest known spot in our solar system. Uh, yes.

61
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:17,860
Do you know it well, Dr. Schmoyzen? I do. What is the lunar south pole?

62
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:23,779
What? What? What is the lunar south pole? Yes. No, it's Neptune. That is the correct answer. What?

63
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:29,000
Neptune. Is it Neptune? I thought Neptune was the coldest spot on the galaxy.

64
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:31,399
What were the questions? Idiot.

65
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:37,879
Oh my. Oh my. It seems like we have a little bit of a rivalry here folks on this evening show.

66
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:43,160
All right, Dr. Schmoyzen. You're, uh, you're taking us away here. What, uh, what are you gonna crush next?

67
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:45,639
Certainly. Let's go for

68
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:55,509
water, water everywhere. All right. Four? How many points? How about 200 points? Water, water everywhere for 200 points.

69
00:06:56,629 --> 00:07:00,870
Reaching down nearly into the underworld. The world's lowest lake sits at

70
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:07,750
1,371 feet below sea level. Uh, what is the Dead Sea?

71
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:11,959
All right. Let's take a look at that answer. What is the Dead Sea?

72
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:16,839
Correctamundo there, Dr. Schmoyzen. Jerma, how you feeling right now? We should have invited Burger Boy.

73
00:07:17,649 --> 00:07:19,959
Because he's getting all these answers right.

74
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:24,920
Uh, so how does it work if he gets it wrong that I get it right? I can answer or we can answer, right?

75
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:30,199
Should he ever? We're in this together. Yeah, Chad. Chad, how you feeling right now? How's it going out there for you folks?

76
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,670
I mean, I kind of wish I could answer a question.

77
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:41,649
I feel like Chad feels the same way. Go on. Go on. No, keep going. All right. All right, Dr. Schmoyzen. Take us away.

78
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,209
All right. Let's try

79
00:07:45,649 --> 00:07:48,449
to be or not to be for 50.

80
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,829
To be or not to be for 50 points? Absolutely.

81
00:07:52,769 --> 00:07:54,769
This carrot crunching

82
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,610
Wascley Wabbit

83
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:03,350
soared Warner Brothers into the spotlight in the 1940s. Dr. Schmoyzen, might you know? Jerma seems to know.

84
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,050
Unfortunately. Who is Bugs Bunny?

85
00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:13,269
We get double points. Put that down here. I get points for that. Let's uh, let's take a quick point check.

86
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:16,790
What do we got here? So we have Jerma, proudly.

87
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:24,339
Would you mind saying aloud what your points may be? How well you doing this evening? Zero. Zero. Okay. All right.

88
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:31,040
Uh, we have chat over here also with zero. Sorry guys. We'll bring back the doctor. This is what happened. I swear to god.

89
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:36,799
And uh, you bring the good doctor back and he just okay. I mean he's a doctor.

90
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,750
He's a doctor. What do you what do you even do about it? Dr. Schmoyzen, proudly here with

91
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:48,070
2,100 points. Doing pretty good. Doing pretty good. I will give you a commend you. Doing well. Doing pretty well. As we should.

92
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:52,389
Good sportsmanship is always appreciated here. Love to answer a question. On our first ever spooky.

93
00:08:52,549 --> 00:08:57,320
I would love to talk on my own stream. It'd be great. Eventually.

94
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,710
I've got the buzzer here, but gone. All right, Dr. Schmoyzen.

95
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:07,509
Why would you like to blow us away with next? Let's go for a 17th century

96
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:11,190
poetry for a 100, please. Gonna be easy.

97
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:18,840
It's gonna be like who is. One of the most influential poetic figures of this era. Most know him now by only two syllables.

98
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,240
Who is Voltaire?

99
00:09:24,049 --> 00:09:31,009
And the answer. Yes. Who is Voltaire? Congratulations, Dr. Schmoyzen. You really know your stuff. How can I say?

100
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:36,610
How do you know all this stuff? It's frankly quite embarrassing. You're a lie detector doctor. You shouldn't know all this information.

101
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:44,440
Maybe you do. I don't know. Maybe. All right, Dr. Schmoyzen. Next category. Yes, indeed.

102
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:50,840
Let's try to continue. Let's try with to be or not to be for.

103
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:58,740
To be or not to be for 400. All right, Parker, Griffin, and Dinklage.

104
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:06,129
All famous faces sharing this common name. Dr. Schmoyzen. Yes, I believe that is

105
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:14,049
Beater. Who's Beater? Who? What is Beater? What? What?

106
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:15,940
What?

107
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:22,019
There's no way you know that question's answer. What do you mean? I should have known that. What does that mean?

108
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:28,500
What does what does happen? I mean, that's why you have it. All right, Dr. Schmoyzen. Take us away.

109
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:31,399
I could have got that question right. How much was that worth?

110
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:34,690
Let's try.

111
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:37,090
Whatever. Are you quite done? I'm, yeah.

112
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:42,840
Let's try to be or not to be for 800, please. All right.

113
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,519
Oh, looks like we have a daily double. Daily double.

114
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,870
Daily double. Hooray. Is it worth double points?

115
00:10:51,720 --> 00:11:00,019
I hope not, for your sake. The best hand is the natural nine in this Bond beloved card game. Dr. Schmoyzen?

116
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:02,519
Yes, that is

117
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:04,070
Poker.

118
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:09,539
I'm sorry, sir. Oh, I can't answer. I'm sorry. Mr. Elbertson. Are you ready to answer?

119
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:15,120
And that question is what is Baccarat? What is Baccarat?

120
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:19,600
Congratulations, Dr. Schmoyzen. You get another several hundred points.

121
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:27,799
This is fucking stupid. All right, Dr. Elbertson. I'm sorry. You're not the doctor. Mr. Elbertson. I went to school.

122
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,799
I imagine.

123
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:31,799
But not for any of these.

124
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,399
All right, Dr. Schmoyzen. What do you got for us?

125
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:41,879
Uh, Shannon. All right. We're ready again. Let's try wide open spaces for 50, please. Okay.

126
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:44,840
Really still going for the low points here.

127
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:49,909
I mean really racking them up. The flattest planet. The flattest planet in our solar system.

128
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:52,950
This was originally thought to be three separate planets.

129
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:56,070
Yes, because of. Can you get me a drink?

130
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,789
What is?

131
00:11:58,789 --> 00:12:03,250
Saturn. What is Saturn? All right. Yes.

132
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:06,110
Congratulations. You've won yet another question.

133
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:13,360
Dr. Mr. Elbertson. How you feeling? Oh, would you like to hear from me? Uh, just this once.

134
00:12:14,429 --> 00:12:18,909
Um, no, this is all right. I guess we're supposed to be able to play together and

135
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,440
2020 hindsight, it really was probably a bad idea to bring somebody that was that smart. We need like

136
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:32,129
50 IQ people up here because I have like 72 IQ. It's just not very good. Oh, he's falling asleep. Oh, it's not great.

137
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:38,129
Okay. All right. All right. This guy. This guy. Me and this guy. What do you got for us, Dr. Schmoyzen? We got history.

138
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:45,710
Are you crazy? Let's try Shannon to start to wrap things up. Let's try

139
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:49,629
water water everywhere for 800, please.

140
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,190
All right, bigger points.

141
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:59,440
This lake just sits at an interesting junction between the borders of Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. Uh, yes.

142
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:07,139
Lake Mead? No, that's in Vegas. What is Lake Constance?

143
00:13:08,379 --> 00:13:11,259
All right. Yes. What is Lake Constance?

144
00:13:11,659 --> 00:13:17,700
Wow, I'm not sure that we've ever had a streak this long on the show. Thank you, Dr. Schmoyzen. All right, take us away.

There's a second round. There is a second round. All right, thanks. We're supposed to be banking points.

I was told it didn't. There it goes. It's out. All right, no more buzzers. No buzzers on this round.

156
00:14:23,179 --> 00:14:25,019

00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:20,740
All right. So Dr. Schmoyzen, as you did lead us in the last round, uh, you do get to pick the first

165
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:27,629
question. Uh, choose wisely, I advise. Um, but, uh, what would you like to talk about today?

173
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:38,580
That's not three. It seems to be a pretty popular number here. I mean, I would imagine, Jerma,

174
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:43,710
with this costume you have on, you might know a bit, a bit about this. I mean, I know a little.

175
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:49,740
I know a little. I mean, if you, oh, this costume. Right. Cause well, it was either this or a child

176
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:53,840
size incredible hook. That's what happens when you buy a costume two days before Halloween.

177
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:59,710
Child size, you say? Yeah. All right. And you're sure that wouldn't fit? How tall are you?

178
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:05,819
What? How tall? What do you mean? What? How tall might you be? Five, six, six feet tall. Six, one.

179
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:10,349
Six, one. You're sure? Yes. In the empirical system?

180
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:20,430
Whatever. Can we get the next question, please? Okay. All right. So what was our answer here for

181
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:30,160
question one of round two? 400 C. So I don't think. Wait, what? It was 400? It was 400.

182
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,740
How does, how does 400 times? Wait, hold on a minute. Let me just get my points back in the

183
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:43,940
middle. There we go. It's not three. It's not three. It's 400. Why is it, why is it not super

184
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:52,609
saying 400? Whatever. All right. We all fucking lose. We're still at zero points. You guys,

185
00:17:52,609 --> 00:18:00,349
we got to do something about this. We're at zero. Okay. All right. So chat, we're going to let you

186
00:18:00,349 --> 00:18:06,990
pick the next category as a kind of rough goings on scene here. What, what category, what number,

187
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:16,430
what are we going for? I think we have Goosebumps books, part two for 1600. Goosebumps part two.

188
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:26,769
All right. Let's see what the question is here. What do we got? Who is Naruto's father? Good lord,

189
00:18:26,769 --> 00:18:37,940
saying his names. All right. Option A. Minato Namikaze. B. Remember this one? Kakashi Hattotake.

190
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:48,769
Goosebumps volume 58. Naruto. C. Kushina Uzumaki and D. Hiruzen Sarutobi.

191
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:57,789
Jerma, might you have an opinion? This is not a Goosebumps book. This is a, this is a Naruto

192
00:18:57,789 --> 00:19:07,839
question. They were just pumped in to be mean to me. Okay. Who is Naruto's father? Yes. Minato

193
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:18,930
Kakashi, Kushina or Hiruzen? I'm going to say, I'm going to say, well, wouldn't it be Naruto?

194
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:23,890
Something Naruto? What's, what's Naruto's first name? I'm not sure that that's how their family

195
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:27,410
names work. Do you know Naruto's first name? Not sure if there's a logic behind this. No, no, no,

196
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:32,269
wait, it's Naruto Uzumaki. I'm not going to say it out loud because you'll get it. It's, uh, wait a

197
00:19:32,269 --> 00:19:36,269
minute, but you'll hear it. I'll tell you. I'll just tell you. I'm going to whisper it to you. Okay.

198
00:19:36,269 --> 00:19:43,089
Okay. The answer that I'm going to give is in case I don't want them to hear. All right. I know

199
00:19:43,089 --> 00:19:47,740
Naruto. You really going to know what the fuck I'm doing? Absolutely. I gave my answer. Not a

200
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:54,299
doubt in my mind. Doctor, go ahead. Oh, yes. Let's uh, well, let's, let's let chat chime in here.

201
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:59,660
Oh, chat has an answer. Chat, how you doing over there? What do we got for chat? All right. So chat

202
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:07,329
has voted A, Minato Namikatsu. Wait, what? Yes. Why did they do that? Why? Because it may be the

203
00:20:07,329 --> 00:20:14,259
correct answer. Why did they do that? I could not tell you. It's, it's, all right. All right. Doing

204
00:20:14,259 --> 00:20:22,180
great. Doctor, we're all friends here. Don't be frozen. You know anything about anime, doctor?

205
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:33,089
Certainly. Uh, it's D, Hirose and Saratobi. D. All right. So chat has voted A. We have Jeremie over

206
00:20:33,089 --> 00:20:41,150
here with C and the doctor with answer D. Now, uh, what might be the correct answer? Who is Minato

207
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:47,819
Namikatsu? A. I need to get one point in this whole game. Otherwise it's going to be bad. Wait,

208
00:20:47,819 --> 00:20:53,839
it's not, it's, I thought it was Naruto Uzumaki. It is not. But that's not, isn't that Naruto's

209
00:20:53,839 --> 00:21:00,930
name? Is that, is that Naruto's name? Naruto Uzumaki? You don't know. Does anybody back there know?

210
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:07,259
Does anybody fucking know? I can't see the chat so I have no idea. What? Okay. All right. All right.

211
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:20,059
Where are they going next? Where are we going next, guys? And it is a somewhat even split.

212
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:23,900
Where are they? Somewhere in between. No one has a favorite. All right. It looks like Jeremie's life.

213
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:32,900
Okay. We're going to take this. Jeremie's life for 800. Okay. I hope to God you get this one right.

214
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:40,400
Oh, what is that? This is our, uh, daily double scare. Daily double scare. Okay. You may be asking

215
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:45,359
what that is. I don't know what that is. So does that, does that mean points are deducted or? It

216
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:50,349
means something fun is going to happen. What the fuck is that thing? What is that thing? Hey, hey!

217
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:57,490
All right. All right. Fun. That was fun. Here he is. That was fun. I think it is. That was very fun.

218
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:02,609
Okay. What was that? And who is that person? I don't remember that person being here an hour ago.

219
00:22:02,609 --> 00:22:09,150
Well, he's a ghost. Can I stand back on my thing? I feel so much more powerful when I'm on this.

220
00:22:09,789 --> 00:22:18,849
If it makes you feel better, yes. Oh, shit. That's better. All right. What's the question?

221
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:27,619
What is Jeremie's grandpa's last name? Once again, Jeremie. I hope to the Lord and Savior

222
00:22:27,619 --> 00:22:38,880
that you get this correct. I, I know this. A. Boyle. B. Richards. C. Wilfred. D. Steelhelm.

223
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:51,859
I know. Tell me. Oh, you, I go first? Yes. Oh, um, but if I say it, then everybody's gonna hear it.

224
00:22:51,859 --> 00:22:57,420
That's true. All right, chat. All right, do chat first, do chat first. Chat, what do you got for us?

225
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:12,910
How to check it? Oh, right. All right. I know what I, my turn. Okay. I'm gonna go with D. D.

226
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:27,710
All right. So chat has said D. Jeremie has said D. Dr. Spoitser? No, C. Wilfred, please. C. Okay.

227
00:23:28,269 --> 00:23:33,789
There it is. All right. What is Steelhelm? Congratulations, chat, as it was your question.

228
00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:38,960
I just wanted to give Jeremie a little bonus there that he got to answer your question. I did.

229
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,759
That's a good question. So there he is. That's an old question, too. That's really cool. All right.

230
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:48,480
So here we go, chat. Still your turn. Winning points over here. What do you got for us?

231
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:56,859
I wonder if it's Naruto's father again. Okay. You're, but you already did Jeremie's life. Yeah,

232
00:23:56,859 --> 00:24:06,859
we already did that one. All right. Okay. So we have anime for 2000. Oh, boy. I wonder what this is.

233
00:24:06,859 --> 00:24:12,539
Here we go. Another daily scare. Well, I can see you here standing there. So wow, this is really

234
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:23,809
fucking scary. Oh, no. There he is. He's scary. What's on his face? Oh, shit. That's what I

235
00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:29,779
should have done. Another fucking Naruto question. All right. All right. Go on.

236
00:24:31,779 --> 00:24:40,420
In Naruto, which of the following is not a current Shinobi village? A. Hidden star village. B.

237
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:50,799
Hidden grass village. C. Hidden rain village. D. Hidden ice village. And this is what is not

238
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:59,299
currently a village. It is not. There's a lot. I don't think any of their villages are out in

239
00:24:59,299 --> 00:25:02,900
the open, honestly, based on these answers. Okay. Well, let's see. Whatever. All right, chat. Chat,

240
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:15,500
what do you got for us? What do you got, chat? What do you got? Are they voting? No, there are

241
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:21,380
more than like three animes that aren't Naruto, right? I don't think they know. Maybe talk to your

242
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:28,420
people. All right. So I'm going to say, all right, grass. I remember grass. That's like what Naruto

243
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:35,759
is in. Naruto is in grass village. A lot of grass. So definitely rain. Grass and rain. Naruto is from

244
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:41,599
grass village. So I'm going to say D. D. I don't know. That's what I'm going with. Okay. So Jared

245
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:48,000
comes in hot with D. Hidden ice village. There's no hidden ice village. Chat has let us know that

246
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:59,970
a hidden star village is their choice. And a doctor. I'll go with hidden star village. A. Sorry,

247
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:10,930
which one? A, please. A. All right. Well, we do have two winners. Yeah. Ice village. That's the one.

248
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:16,000
I knew it. I'm telling you. He's from grass village. There's only like two other options.

249
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,839
There we go. He's getting more points here. So not exactly taking the lead. 2800. Holy shit.

250
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:25,519
That's pretty good. That's pretty great. Yeah. Second place. Come on. You got to suck it up a

251
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:32,559
little bit here. Professors look a little sleepy here. All right. Jerma, your turn. I get to pick.

252
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:38,130
You do get to pick. Oh, all right. You know what? I got an idea here. Why don't we do

253
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:50,319
Jerma's content for 2000. Jerma's content for 2000. Hopefully. I hope so. How many

254
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:57,039
YouTube subscribers did Jerma have when he had 100 uploads? What? How would anybody know this?

255
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:13,359
10,000? B, 50,000? C, 75,000? Or D, 100,000? At any rate, pretty impressive. Do you know?

256
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:24,619
I could take a pretty good guess. Chat, go first. All right, chat. You go first. You go first.

257
00:27:24,619 --> 00:27:30,829
Chat, what do you got for us? All right. So it seems that there's a little bit of a split

258
00:27:30,829 --> 00:27:39,200
in chat. Really? But B is winning. So chat believes that you had 50,000 followers for 100 uploads.

259
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:50,750
I don't think so. I think it's more. No, or less. 100. Okay. My first, my first like 40 uploads went

260
00:27:50,750 --> 00:28:02,750
to like 30 people. I know that for a fact. No, I'm going to write. I'm going with A. A? All right. So

261
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:10,190
Jerma's coming in with A. It might be a little too low. Chat has B. Dr. Schmoyzen. What is it?

262
00:28:12,019 --> 00:28:24,660
You know what YouTube is? C. C. He doesn't know what YouTube is. Okay. What is 10,000?

263
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:31,150
Congratulations, Jerma. You know your own life. I know my own channel. It's doing great. And I'm

264
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:39,230
fucking posing. Let's do a little point check here. We have Jerma with 4,800. Climbing up on you.

265
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:44,109
Chat with 1,600. You guys are not doing very well. And the professor with 5,050. He's not doing very

266
00:28:44,109 --> 00:28:47,329
well. Yeah, it doesn't seem like he's doing too well in the second round. I'm about to pass you.

267
00:28:47,329 --> 00:28:51,970
Yeah, yeah. All right. So let's let chat pick the next question here. Get a little interaction.

268
00:28:56,769 --> 00:29:07,410
All right. Where are we going? How are we doing? All right. What is that for 2,000? Frankly, guys,

269
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:12,529
I'm pretty excited for this one. What is that? What is that? What does that mean? What is that?

270
00:29:12,529 --> 00:29:23,069
Maybe the category. Yes. Okay. Who is this? I have my own guesses, but I shouldn't say.

271
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:38,660
All right. A few seconds left on the clock here, Jerma. How is chat going to be able to answer this?

272
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:46,900
What do you mean, who is this? They can't answer this question. There's no choices here.

273
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:56,049
It's just who is this? All right. What are they writing? Is it a better idea? What are they

274
00:29:56,049 --> 00:30:04,210
writing? It's a gnome is what they're saying. Okay. It's anum or it is gnome. I'm going to go with

275
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:20,740
a close-up of a mustache. A mustache? What's the red? What is the red? That's what I want to know.

276
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:25,220
Doctor, you're a doctor. What is that? Yes, doctor. Might you have a live opinion of this?

277
00:30:26,099 --> 00:30:32,589
Sure. It's a rabbit. It's a rabbit. A rabbit? I'm going to go with a mustache. I'm going to

278
00:30:32,589 --> 00:30:37,309
go with a mustache. A mustache. All right. So we've got a gnome, a mustache, and a rabbit.

279
00:30:37,309 --> 00:30:46,369
Chat's answer is A. What is it? Which I hate to inform you, it's not a multiple choice question.

280
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:56,049
It's Ronald Reagan, folks. Ronald Reagan. Unfortunately, we're not going to be able to

281
00:30:56,049 --> 00:31:04,109
give out any points for this round. That's impossible. That is an impossible question.

282
00:31:04,109 --> 00:31:09,390
I think we should all get 1,000 points. We all get 1,000 points for that one

283
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:14,829
because that's impossible. Mr. Albertson. You know what? No, fuck it. We're going,

284
00:31:14,829 --> 00:31:20,980
what is that for 1,600? All right, he's taking the lead. Mr. Albertson. Let's go. Let's go. What is

285
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:33,500
it? What song is this? What song is this? Listen up, folks. What song is this? How are we going to hear

286
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:48,769
this? What? What song is this? You've got to give more than a tenth of a second. What song is this?

287
00:31:54,619 --> 00:31:59,920
Do it again. I need you to do it again. Professor, where are you in all this?

288
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,680
We're both on the same page. I don't think we can both get this. Do it like a couple, two more times.

289
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:17,069
So chat's answer is in. Okay, chat's answer is in. So a couple more seconds here.

290
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,789
I'm pretty impressed with their knowledge, honestly.

291
00:32:19,789 --> 00:32:31,650
There are like 700,000 songs that all of them start like that. I'm going to say

292
00:32:39,809 --> 00:32:43,410
And time's up. Professor, what is your answer? I have no idea. I have absolutely no idea.

293
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:49,329
Row Your Boat. Row Your Boat, folks. Row Your Boat. All right. Actually, that's pretty good.

294
00:32:49,329 --> 00:32:55,680
Chat's answer, Blue Daboudi by Eiffel 65. Jerma.

295
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:08,160
I don't think that's an answer. Whatever. How many points was that worth?

296
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:15,869
1600. All right. So chat got 1600 points just in that question. Congratulations, chat. What's

297
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:21,069
your final time? 3200 points. All right. We're still in third here, but we can still catch up.

298
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:26,720
All right. So chat, you're up next to pick the question. Let's see what you got.

299
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:40,720
15, 18%, 20%. All right. Jerma's Friends for 2000. Okay.

300
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:48,609
Oh, look at this. He's ready. Oh, look at that.

301
00:33:49,329 --> 00:33:55,299
Too much. Look, let him see you. Let him see you. Go to this camera right here. Look at this. Look

302
00:33:55,299 --> 00:34:05,809
over there. Let him see you. He's got like a metal face. There he is, folks. Hope you're enjoying

303
00:34:05,809 --> 00:34:14,769
that at home. Here we go. All right. How many formal appearances has Mr. Sneak Man had? Mr. Sneak?

304
00:34:14,769 --> 00:34:27,760
A, three. B, four. C, five. D, six. Formal appearances. That doesn't count. What do you mean

305
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:35,280
informal? Has there ever been an informal appearance? What's your opinion? Okay. One.

306
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:48,320
No, he wasn't even in Jerma, but one. Two. Chat, what do you think? Okay. I think I have an idea

307
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:58,099
because he was in like, he was in at least two. One, two. I have an idea. I have an idea.

308
00:34:59,469 --> 00:35:09,139
I got an idea. All right. Jerma, what do you have? Five. C. Five. C. All right. So, Jerma,

309
00:35:09,699 --> 00:35:20,639
answer C with five. Chat, A with three. Professor? A, three. That actually might be three.

310
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:28,380
That actually might be three. All right. It's six. What is six? What are they, though? Do we know?

311
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:37,409
Jerma Rumble 2, Jerma Rumble 3, Jerma Rumble Rumblehouse. Is it three? Do I not even know?

312
00:35:37,409 --> 00:35:44,880
Is it three? Did you black out? There's only been three rumbles and then like one or two offshoots.

313
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:50,980
It's six? What's the other video? I have no idea. All right. I have no idea. Well, since you don't

314
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:54,800
know your own life, we're going to move on from this. Well, I mean, let's pull out random shit

315
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,300
from everybody else's life from 10 years ago and find out what it is. All right. Chat, what do you

316
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:19,199
have for us? And what is that for 1200? Our favorite category here in round two. Who is this?

317
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:26,510
That's either an eye or a mouth. I don't know. Bold statements there. Professor looks a bit

318
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:32,030
perplexed. But we don't get any. Nope. There's no way for us to answer this. Nope. That's all you get.

319
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:40,190
Eight grainy potato pixels. Why do you think they're spelling out? Is it like an I? I think

320
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:49,219
it's an I. There's no way anybody can answer. You think it's an I. I'm falling off my body.

321
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:56,780
Let's go with. All right, Jerma. Chat has their answer in. What do you got for us?

322
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:01,280
How do you mean chat has their answer in? They're very confident. There's a consensus already.

323
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:09,340
They're confident people. Okay. So chat has their answer in now. And it took them 15 seconds. Is

324
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:20,750
this something that I don't know that I should know? I'm going to say my eye. Your eye. Your own eye.

325
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:32,190
My own eye like zoomed in or something. Wow. All right. Chat, your answer is scout and professor.

326
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:43,389
That's pretty good. Lassie. Lassie. That's could be. Jeremy's own eye, scout or lassie. All right,

327
00:37:43,389 --> 00:37:50,780
let's see who it is. It is the one, the only Genghis Khan. Could you at least have made these

328
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:56,559
like slightly related to like the community? Congratulations everyone, you all lost. That's

329
00:37:56,559 --> 00:38:02,369
a painting of Genghis Khan. That's not Genghis Khan. That's a portrait of Genghis Khan,

330
00:38:02,369 --> 00:38:10,159
right? That's a portrait. That's not a picture. All right, whatever. All right. Are they picking

331
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:25,360
again? Back to the board. Where are they going? Chat, what do we got? I think we know. What is

332
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:33,389
this for 800? Shittiest category. Best category I think you mean. Thank you doc. What song is this?

333
00:38:33,389 --> 00:38:36,429
What song is this? Oh, I wonder what it is.

334
00:38:36,429 --> 00:38:42,289
Oh, I've heard that one on the radio a thousand times.

335
00:38:54,980 --> 00:39:01,980
Three seconds. A full three seconds. Do it. A full three seconds. Do we not have a full three

336
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:06,539
seconds if the song is not available? That's the whole song actually. That's the whole song.

337
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:12,190
Every song starts like that. Every single song in human history goes like

338
00:39:14,349 --> 00:39:23,250
that and then it goes into the song. What song is that? Can you even name the song you just

339
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:32,880
saw? No, but they all do that. I don't know. Gorillaz. A Gorillaz song. Not even a single

340
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:43,570
specific one. All right. Might be a Gorillaz song. Congratulations to those three people.

341
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:48,610
If you can sort through all those comments, you may be one of them. Three people got this right?

342
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:55,519
How? Unless this is your favorite song and you just know it like it's just automatic.

343
00:39:55,519 --> 00:40:02,989
Find them after an award. This is ridiculous. I think this is ridiculous. Oh wow. I mean I'm

344
00:40:02,989 --> 00:40:06,829
creeping up on you and I'll probably I mean I'm getting close but you know. Not too close I hope.

345
00:40:07,469 --> 00:40:14,719
I mean you're still in the lead but we'll see. And professor, your answer? Sound of music. The

346
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:34,880
sound of music, folks. You just played every dubstep stop. I don't even know how to say it.

347
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:41,389
You played every dubstep song I've ever heard. Is that correct? It was Beetlejuice. That's not

348
00:40:41,389 --> 00:40:48,190
Beetlejuice. Beetlejuice goes. That's a dubstep mix. That's a dubstep mix of Beetlejuice. Yes.

349
00:40:50,019 --> 00:40:53,139
Have you been on the internet? Yeah. That's what we listen to. What's going to happen in 20 more

350
00:40:53,139 --> 00:41:00,380
years? Are they going to do a dubstep remix of the remix of Beetlejuice? How the fuck would anybody

351
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:03,820
know that? All right. So are we giving that to chat since three people got it right or?

352
00:41:06,849 --> 00:41:10,670
No. They're going to be dropping glasses on the ground. It's going to sound like

353
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:13,869
Beetlejuice and they'll do it. It'll be like another remix 30 years in the future. God damn

354
00:41:13,869 --> 00:41:18,429
millennials. All right. We're going to give that to chat. Congratulations to those three people.

355
00:41:18,429 --> 00:41:23,389
You know who you are. Go wild. You're giving it to chat even though three people got it right.

356
00:41:23,389 --> 00:41:29,789
And guess what category chat has picked next. What is that for 400? No, this better be really easy.

357
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:38,030
It's not. What do you mean it's not? Oh. Who is this? That's a lampshade. That's what you're

358
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:41,630
saying in that? No, I'm not saying it yet. I'm not saying it yet. All right. Hold on. The professor's

359
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:52,000
down. It's not. You're looking for the exit. All right. I think he's pretty done. All right,

360
00:41:52,000 --> 00:42:05,099
Jeremiah. Give me your best shot. I know what I'd guess. It's an egg. It's an egg? No, it's not an

361
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:15,250
egg. Is it like an embryo? Yours are very thematic here. Is it like an egg? Is it like a zoomed in

362
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:28,349
egg? Like a microscope egg? All right. So we have egg. Egg. Chat says doge. Doge. And professor?

363
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:52,420
UFO kazoo. A UFO kazoo. Oh, it's actually. I hope for your sake it is a UFO kazoo.

364
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:59,900
Oh, it's Banjo Kazooie. Here we have it, folks. Banjo Kazooie. You got it pretty close.

365
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:08,510
You got it pretty close. A UFO kazoo. You just had to add an IE on the end and you would have

366
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:15,940
added it. Unfortunately, Dr. Shmoysen, that was not the answer we were looking for. A UFO shaped

367
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:27,650
kazoo? Or a UFO with a kazoo? Why don't you tell me? All right, Dr. Lee, the category.

368
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:35,409
This has been wildly concerning. Chat, we're going to let you pick the next one here.

369
00:43:35,409 --> 00:43:40,530
Banjo Kazooie. A bit of a mess on site here. What do you mean what is that? We already did all of

370
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:47,980
them. They want more. All right. All right. There you go, Dr. Shmoysen. Well deserved.

371
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:53,659
UFO kazoo. Get that as a tattoo. I'm going to give you a clap for that one. All right. Who is

372
00:43:53,659 --> 00:44:11,250
the narrow-toes father? Who is it? All right. Anime for $1,600. Good Lord. Who is the only

373
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:24,579
homunculus without... Excuse me. It's Ouroboros. I know. I've got the outfit on.

374
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:29,920
You better get this right. Who is the only homunculus without Ouroboros tattoo?

375
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:41,550
A. Envy. B. Pride. C. Gluttony. D. Sloth. But what anime? It's just anime. Who is the only

376
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:47,260
homunculus in anime that doesn't have a tattoo? Showing his true colors here. Honey, come on.

377
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:54,400
What do you think? I got this. Well, it seems like we have quite a consensus from chat. So,

378
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:59,199
they seem to have narrowed down. I actually do know this. Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood is my...

379
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:04,400
I hear people laughing. I hear people laughing back there. Multiple. And it's messing with my

380
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:09,199
psyche. All right. I know this because it's one of my favorite animes ever. It's one of the only

381
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:15,460
animes I've ever watched. That would be... Well, Doctor, why don't you answer for me? Pause. Yes.

382
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:25,920
C. Gluttony. All right. C. Gluttony. Pretty good guess. We have chat here. Strong answer. B.

383
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:30,880
Right. I said it at the same time. Wow. Right. There you go. Hey. Hey. Hey. Come on, man. Ready?

384
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:37,619
High five. Ready. Get in there. Well, I was talking to chat. He's in it. He's in it to win it here,

385
00:45:37,619 --> 00:45:45,010
folks. All nine of us. All right. I'll still give you a high five, though. All right. So, the answer

386
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:51,170
is yes. B. Who is pride? Yes. How much was that worth? That was a really high point question for

387
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:57,460
being so easy. So easy. That was very easy. Have you ever seen Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood?

388
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:00,900
Not the original one. The original one, they split halfway through. Full Metal Alchemist,

389
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:06,800
Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood. The Brotherhood is a real story from the manga. I'm sorry. No,

390
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:13,519
like the back here hid. Oh, I thought you said it's not. I was like, excuse me. Oh, my. Say it's not.

391
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:18,000
All right, Jeremy. We're going to give you this one. All right. We'll do Jerma985's content for

392
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:26,349
$1,600. I know my own stuff. All right. Jerma's content for $1,600. What did Jerma do to personally

393
00:46:26,349 --> 00:46:36,750
thank his first 500 subscribers? A. Tell a personal story. B. Create a TF2 server. C. Lift weights.

394
00:46:38,269 --> 00:46:48,900
The funniest part about this is the correct answer is like the shittiest one. Nothing. Jerma,

395
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:54,420
how about you go? Let's have Doctor answer first. Oh, yeah, Doctor. What do you think I would do?

396
00:46:54,420 --> 00:47:03,579
Sure. How about nothing? Nothing. Strong nothing, Professor. What about chat? Chat? Chat's gone with

397
00:47:03,579 --> 00:47:10,030
C. Lift weights. It is C. Lift weights. Doctor, you haven't seen my 500 subscriber thank you video

398
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:14,590
where I was in the bottom of my parents' Facebook, lifting 35 pound dumbbells, pretending to be really

399
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:21,219
cool? Possibly. You haven't seen that video? Best gift to us all. Yeah, I mean, it probably was.

400
00:47:21,219 --> 00:47:26,530
All right. Wait a minute. Hold on a second. How many points is that? How many points do I have?

401
00:47:26,530 --> 00:47:32,059
I'm doing pretty good. 6400 to be exact. Chat in. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

402
00:47:32,059 --> 00:47:40,269
wait, wait. Chat just get all those points. Update. Jerma, we have... I want, I want Goose,

403
00:47:40,269 --> 00:47:46,110
I get to go, right? Yes. I want Goosebumps Books for 2000. Let's go. Bring it in. Goosebumps for

404
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:55,199
2000. In Monster Blood, what is the name of the witch that gives the blood its abilities? A.

405
00:47:55,199 --> 00:48:13,659
Sarabeth. B. Ymiriden. C. Valshesh. D. Syndral. In Monster Blood. Yes. You ever read the Goosebumps

406
00:48:13,659 --> 00:48:21,119
Book? No. He must like reading Doctor. Yes, certainly. Doctor Professor. I mean, you've read

407
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:24,719
a lot of books, but have any of them been Goosebumps Books? I don't think you're allowed to wear elbow

408
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:30,880
patches if you don't read all of them. Oh, come on. Goosebumps? Goosebumps? Yeah, R.L. Stein. Great

409
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:37,619
literature. Yeah, that's good stuff. All right, I got my answer. Okay. I'm gonna, okay, I'm gonna,

410
00:48:37,619 --> 00:48:44,019
my reasoning for this answer is it's the only one that has a apostrophe in it, so that makes sense

411
00:48:44,019 --> 00:48:49,710
to me. It's elegant. So I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say Valshesh. C. C. Valshesh. Because that's like,

412
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:53,630
oh, it's a scary name, because it's like, oh, it's Valshesh. It's like a different, you know,

413
00:48:53,630 --> 00:49:03,409
that makes sense to me. And Chat, what was your answer? What was Chat's name? Chat says A.

414
00:49:04,289 --> 00:49:10,750
That's like a regular name. It's a very regular name. Hello to all the Cerebets out there.

415
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:20,000
Professor? Valshesh. That's a good, right? That's a good answer. So we have two Cs and an A. That

416
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,519
means I'm as smart as a doctor, by the way, if anyone's watching. That means I'm as intelligent

417
00:49:23,519 --> 00:49:30,420
as he is. All right, so the correct answer is A. Cerebetsh. It's actually Cerebetsh. It is Cerebetsh,

418
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:36,380
yes. It's actually Cerebetsh. The apostrophe proved you wrong, unfortunately. Okay, well,

419
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:48,670
that's all good. All right, Chat, since you won that round, where are we going? I believe...

420
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:53,889
There are no more what is this category, so stop choosing it. Please do not all choose

421
00:49:53,889 --> 00:50:05,820
what is that. Anime. All right, anime for $1200. I think we have a specific crowd here. They do

422
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:13,679
know they're anime. I could... Rightfully so. What is the name of the cage in the hidden mist?

423
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:28,820
A. Hokage. Hokage? I don't even know this answer, but I know it's kage. It's kage and hokage.

424
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:44,579
That one. B. Raikage. C. Mizukage. And D. Kazekage. I already said it. A. All right,

425
00:50:44,579 --> 00:50:51,920
well, we have your answer. That hurt my hand a little. Professor? Give me a minute.

426
00:50:53,599 --> 00:51:08,320
Will do. D. Kazekage. Kazekage. It could be. I don't know. I think it's hokage. All right,

427
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:18,300
and then we have Chat's answer. C. Mizukage. And they are correct. What is Mizukage? Congratulations,

428
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:23,820
Chat. Congratulations. You won another, what was that, 1200 points? Is it 1200? I believe it was.

429
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:31,469
So what do you have now? Was it 9200? 10,400 points. They have broken the barrier, folks.

430
00:51:31,469 --> 00:51:38,829
They're in the five digits. All right, congratulations. Are they going anywhere else?

431
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:48,610
All right. I'm sorry to say this, but I mean, you gotta get it. Come on. You know, you gotta

432
00:51:48,610 --> 00:51:51,889
get a G. Come on. You're Jeremy's life for 2000? Let's see how well you do here.

433
00:51:53,789 --> 00:52:00,349
Here we are. Jeremy's life for 2000. How did Jeremy get the scar on the back of his head?

434
00:52:00,349 --> 00:52:09,940
A. Baseball accident. I know this, like very, very, very vividly. B. Being karate kid. C.

435
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:17,699
Falling off a ladder. D. Thinking too hard. Well, that's a funny meme answer for the last one.

436
00:52:17,699 --> 00:52:22,349
I wonder, I wonder how many people actually get this. Me too. In the chat. I really am curious.

437
00:52:22,349 --> 00:52:29,150
Me too. Because I think I've told the story, like, have I ever told the story ever? I don't think

438
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:36,340
I've ever told the story. Maybe I have. Professor, what do you think about Jeremy's life at this point?

439
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:38,980
How do you think he got that scar? I have a scar on the back of my head. Maybe you could take a

440
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:45,780
look at it later. Why don't we try thinking too hard? I see he's making fun of me. I know he has

441
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:51,059
like 132 IQ. He's trying to make me look bad. That's all right. Getting a little heated in here.

442
00:52:51,059 --> 00:52:57,780
That's okay. That's fine. Everyone's allowed one, right? Chat says C. Falling off a ladder.

443
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:05,780
Well, unfortunately, you're all wrong. It's from B. Being the Karate Kid. Karate Kid was one of the

444
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:09,300
most popular movies when I was younger and my brother kicked me off the bed. We were doing it.

445
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:14,019
I smashed my head on the back of a fireplace. I actually had to get a bunch of staples in my head

446
00:53:14,579 --> 00:53:19,780
and I remember it was very, very, very tragic. It was very, like, very, like, very, like, tragic.

447
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:22,980
It was horrible. Sorry. I remember it for the rest of my life. It's Karate Kid. That's correct.

448
00:53:23,699 --> 00:53:27,940
Being Karate Kid. That's right. Not acting as Karate Kid. I mean, like, in that moment,

449
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:33,710
you were Karate Kid. I was like 11. Got it. How many points was that worth? 2,000. Why was

450
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:39,570
that worth so much points? And Jerma? Okay, so I get to pick now, right? All right. Absolutely.

451
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:46,530
Why don't we go with, I'm going to stay there. Let's go. Jeremy's Life 1600. I'm going to bank

452
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:53,630
points here. Jeremy's Life for 1600, folks. During what year did Jerma's brother get married?

453
00:53:54,429 --> 00:54:05,539
A. 2009. B. 2010. C. 2011. And D. 2012. Jerma, do you know?

454
00:54:07,409 --> 00:54:12,449
That's really easy to get wrong because it's a four-year span, so I could be,

455
00:54:13,409 --> 00:54:27,019
I hope you're not watching because I'm probably going to get it wrong. I have an idea.

456
00:54:33,059 --> 00:54:36,500
25% chance of getting it right here. There is a 20, but it's like, look, okay,

457
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:43,440
let me explain. There's a way, when you have a span of, like, a lot of people got married

458
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:49,199
during that time. I had my brother, my sister, a bunch of friends, and it all happened between,

459
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:54,079
like, 2009 and 2012. We're looking for a one-sentence answer here, sir. Okay, I'm going to say.

460
00:54:59,139 --> 00:55:04,739
I think the professor knows. Do you know this? He's there. I was actually at the, were you at the

461
00:55:04,739 --> 00:55:09,380
wedding? You may have been. The best man, pay attention. I'm going to go with B. 2010. Final

462
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:18,639
answer. That's how this works on final millionaire. Final millionaire. I think it was 2010, I think.

463
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:22,429
It could have been 2009. I don't know. All right, so Jerma with B.

464
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:35,179
Chat, your answer. C, 2011. I don't think it was. Professor? B, 2010. Right, I know, come on.

465
00:55:35,739 --> 00:55:44,019
B, 2010. All right, and here we have it, folks, the correct answer. What is 2011? Right. Okay,

466
00:55:44,019 --> 00:55:51,469
well, I was, I was one year away. Just one. Just one. I mean, it was, all right, so I, I switched

467
00:55:51,469 --> 00:55:55,780
him around. I switched him around. I switched him around. It's okay. I was, it was within like

468
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:59,940
eight months. Okay, that's fine. Happens to all of us. That's right. Okay. All the best of us.

469
00:56:01,389 --> 00:56:04,190
Where's chat going? All right, chat, we're going to let you pick this next one.

473
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:40,110
remember the, I don't remember. Seems like a personal problem, sir. I'm sorry. I don't remember.

474
00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:43,389
I don't remember. I was paying attention. If you had to guess. Why would I not pay attention during

475
00:56:43,389 --> 00:56:51,809
a quiz show? Okay, it's not, doc, it's, let's work together on this because, are we allowed to do

476
00:56:51,809 --> 00:56:57,889
that? It was, it was not, okay, it was not Uzumaki. I remember that. What, what, what's the answer?

483
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:42,110
cord out from you guys. Then we have the professor here with his award-winning first round 5,850

484
00:57:42,110 --> 00:57:46,829
points. That's just what happened. The tables have turned here, folks. All right, so who picks?

485
00:57:46,829 --> 00:57:58,690
Chat? Chat's gonna get to pick this one. Jerma's friends for 1,600. My friends. I love all my

488
00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:34,510
I'm gonna say, no, I gave Adam Sandler zero in every category, so definitely listen.

489
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:47,900
I'm gonna say Greenscreen. I'm gonna say B. A little bit of a kerfuffle here on the set,

folks. We're doing all right. We're all right. A little rowdy. Am I hurt? No, I've never hurt.

00:59:30,369 --> 00:59:39,469
dangerous. Maybe we go back to your real height. All right, last question here, folks. This is the

503
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:10,900
will heal you. Yeah, I don't think I'd have that much bullshit in the title. Maybe I would.

504
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:17,980
We're looking for the real video title. Oh, okay, the real one. Yes. It's so confusing. There's so

many words. C. C. All right. Chat, what do you got? What is a real video title? Chat says B.

01:01:56,539 --> 01:02:04,019
the above. All right. Okay. All right. Okay. So I suppose you would all get the points there.

508
01:02:04,019 --> 01:02:09,059
Do we all get the points? What do we have? Right. What's our account right now? What do we have for

509
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:22,210
account? Total. 12, 4, 10, 4, 13, 11, 7. Doing well here, Chat. Crap. Well done. Oh crap. I have

510
01:02:22,210 --> 01:02:30,739
a question. Yes. Can I go to the bathroom? Can you go to the bathroom? I mean, it's your show. You

511
01:02:30,739 --> 01:02:37,010
can do whatever you want. Really, really badly. I mean, if you really have to. I mean, yeah. Do

512
01:02:37,010 --> 01:02:41,010
you want to stop the stream? I mean, it is your show. No, no, no. Keep the stream going. I have

513
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:45,489
to go to the bathroom. Okay. All right. We will keep going with that. Stay strong. I hope you make

514
01:02:45,489 --> 01:02:51,630
it. How many points do I have? Let's do a final count before he checks up. I have 11, 6. If they

515
01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:58,510
change that, tell me, Chat, okay? There he goes. All right. 13,600. And Dr. Schmoyzen, what did you

516
01:02:58,510 --> 01:03:07,679
have? I think, oh. 7,050. All right. Okay. So Chat, you're still in the lead here. All right. We

517
01:03:07,679 --> 01:03:15,179
do have time for a couple more questions. Apologies for that before, folks. All right. So Dr. Schmoyzen,

518
01:03:15,179 --> 01:03:35,780
would you like to pick? Certainly. I will take Goosebumps 400. All right. Sorry. Goosebumps for

nobody was allowed to answer? A. The Evil Chamber. B. The Ghost Room. C. The Forbidden Room. D. The

01:03:54,989 --> 01:04:04,050

01:04:04,050 --> 01:04:14,929
my library. D. Forbidden Cabin. All right. So we have D. The Forbidden Cabin. Chat, what do you

523
01:04:14,929 --> 01:04:28,239
got for us? All right. You've agreed with the professor D. The Forbidden Cabin. And our correct

524
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:40,559
answer would be? It is D. The Forbidden Cabin. Congratulations to all of you out there at home

525
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:46,699
and the professor. Wonderful. All right. So let's trade off here. Chat, we're going to let you pick

526
01:04:46,699 --> 01:05:06,719
the next question. All right. So we got Goosebumps books, part two, for 1600. In The Abominable

527
01:05:06,719 --> 01:05:12,480
Snowman of Pasadena, what allows Jordan and Nicole to escape the grasp of the snowman during their

528
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:23,230
first encounter? A. Loud construction work. B. A barking dog. C. A police siren. D. The cave

529
01:05:23,230 --> 01:05:44,909
collapses. Professor, are you familiar with this specific work? No. Barking dog. All right. The

530
01:05:44,909 --> 01:05:54,340
professor goes with B. A barking dog. Chat, could you help us out here? What do you got for us?

531
01:05:54,340 --> 01:06:02,079
Chat agrees. B. A barking dog. All right. Let's see if we're all right here. The correct answer

532
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:14,480
is B. Congratulations to the both of you again. Well done. We're really racking up points here.

533
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:20,500
All right. Professor, we're going to let you go. Select a category. Select your points here.

534
01:06:22,639 --> 01:06:31,940
Goosebumps, once again, for 800, please. All right. Let's go with Goosebumps for 800.

535
01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:36,909
In The Haunted Mask, what does Carly Beth notice when she puts on the mask?

536
01:06:36,909 --> 01:06:48,639
A. It doesn't fit. B. She looks taller. C. It changes her eyes. D. Her friend has the same one.

537
01:06:48,639 --> 01:06:59,219
How embarrassing. She looks taller? All right. The professor's going to go with B. She looks taller.

538
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:10,829
Chat's going to go with C. It changes her eyes. All right. Well, let's see what happens in this

539
01:07:10,829 --> 01:07:25,119
novel. It is C. It changes her eyes. Congratulations. All right. What points are we up to now?

540
01:07:31,519 --> 01:07:37,409
16,400. Really crushing it out there, folks. Folks there at home. All right. Looks like you get to

541
01:07:37,409 --> 01:08:07,010
choose the next question. We have Jerma's friends for 1200. Did Jerma kill Santa Claus? A. It was

542
01:08:07,010 --> 01:08:16,430
self-defense. B. Jerma pleads insanity. C. No, he did not. And D. The magic can never die.

543
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:26,289
Professor, thoughts on this. Did Jerma kill Santa Claus? When's the last time you saw him?

544
01:08:28,770 --> 01:08:35,659
Jerma pleads insanity. B. Jerma pleads insanity. Answer B. Chat, what are your thoughts on this

545
01:08:35,739 --> 01:08:50,109
subject? All right. Also B. Jerma pleads insanity. All right. Let's see what our answer. What is

546
01:08:51,310 --> 01:08:57,250
none of the above? Sorry, guys. This is one of our first rounds in a while. And it looks like

547
01:08:57,250 --> 01:09:02,779
we're out of time. Thank you very much for joining us again here, professor. Let's get a final point

548
01:09:02,779 --> 01:09:15,520
count. All right. We have Jerma currently in the bathroom with 11,600 points. Chat with 16,400.

549
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:22,319
Congratulations, guys. And the professor again with 9,050. We look forward to seeing you again

550
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:28,420
next time. I'm Shannon Cheryl. I will be on the next rumble. And we're going to go off and pass

551
01:09:28,420 --> 01:12:58,640
this off to B.F. Bugleberry. I got something to tell you guys. No, no. Have we ever seen him again?

552
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:11,680
Have we ever seen him again? Who knows? Lord, I can't believe it. Ladies and gentlemen,

553
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:26,960
welcome to my scary, horrible portion of the screen if you don't know. Because I am B.F. Bugleberry

554
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:54,579
V1. And seeing all the feedback, I've seen what people have been saying. Every single person says,

555
01:13:54,579 --> 01:14:01,869
Bugleberry, we love you. We love your stories. We love the funny things. You do the funny things.

556
01:14:01,869 --> 01:14:16,369
You say the interesting, horrible things. What would I love to see something do from you? I've

557
01:14:16,369 --> 01:14:25,260
seen the response. And I have something very special for you today to do one of my other passions.

558
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:32,930
That's not just scary stories. It's something else entirely, endeavorish, something awful,

559
01:14:32,930 --> 01:14:39,010
something that you will throw up in your mouth when you see the disgusting thing that you're going to

560
01:14:39,010 --> 01:14:50,560
see today. We're going to do pottery. Pottery with Bugleberry will show you the techniques you do.

561
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:58,399
If you will get your materials out of class, I will show you horrible ends.

562
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:04,930
Well, the first thing you need to do is you have all of your materials.

563
01:15:04,930 --> 01:15:12,689
You need clay. You can get it at a local clay store. Make sure it is pottery clay.

564
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:19,439
We're going to slap that right in the center of our pottery here.

565
01:15:23,979 --> 01:15:39,970
So full of demonic energy. Oh, I can feel it. Do that too if you need somebody to do that for you.

566
01:15:39,970 --> 01:15:48,699
If you need somebody to curse your clay, you're probably asked, what do you use these for?

567
01:15:49,739 --> 01:15:59,600
Well, you see, I get my friends together and all of us, all of us get together and we make urns

568
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:06,180
for all kinds of purposes. And what I'm doing right now is centering the clay. That's right.

569
01:16:06,180 --> 01:16:13,699
You need to get a little bit more water. The thing about clay molding is you need to feel yourself

570
01:16:13,699 --> 01:16:20,979
get into it. Don't just put your hands on the clay. That's not how it works. Get into the clay.

571
01:16:21,939 --> 01:16:28,909
Feel it, center mouse. We are making today an urn to keep up.

572
01:16:32,510 --> 01:16:39,739
That's what we're doing. Now, when I put my hand up, you want to make sure all the wheels

573
01:16:39,739 --> 01:16:52,670
to put your hands in as if you are driving a car at 10 and two. Very tightly around the clay.

574
01:16:52,670 --> 01:16:56,800
We are doing this to create a center mass, like I said before.

575
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:08,500
It gets very hot, especially if you get your clay from the underworld. Once we have achieved

576
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:14,100
the circle in the center, we're going to move with this part of your hand. Use the bone.

577
01:17:14,659 --> 01:17:19,949
Don't use this part alone. That's not the part you're supposed to use. You're supposed to use

578
01:17:19,949 --> 01:17:27,819
the pinky all the way down to the breastbone. You're simply going to place it here and you're

579
01:17:27,819 --> 01:17:35,789
going to put some pressure down to give yourself a nice center. Just even pressure down the middle.

580
01:17:36,670 --> 01:17:42,189
Not too much. You should end up a nice flat top like that. I have a little bit of an issue on the

581
01:17:42,189 --> 01:17:47,149
side. You don't have to go full throttle. That's my father used to tell me. He said,

582
01:17:47,149 --> 01:17:55,520
Barry, you don't got to go full throttle. I'd say, fuck you, Barry. I never saw him again.

583
01:17:56,319 --> 01:18:05,680
So as we center the clay on to continue to put pressure down into the middle just enough to

584
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:23,229
give us a nice urn shape reminds me of a story. We don't need that today. We're just making urns.

585
01:18:23,229 --> 01:18:35,600
And as I continue, and my people, we need to get really close in here. Make sure your clay

586
01:18:35,600 --> 01:19:04,109
always needs to be wet. Do not ever try to mold clay. There's a large presence

587
01:19:05,149 --> 01:19:08,989
in this part of the moment. I can feel it. There's something in this room.

588
01:19:09,789 --> 01:19:21,090
But as I try to, what is that?

589
01:19:44,479 --> 01:20:02,189
Don't worry. I got it on my bottom, everybody. As we continue, I'm going to start creating.

590
01:20:02,189 --> 01:20:12,539
I do this with my friends all the time. We always get together. We create. Creation is incredibly

591
01:20:12,539 --> 01:20:21,729
important. As you see, we have a nice piece here, which I'm going to now put my two thumbs down,

592
01:20:21,729 --> 01:20:32,430
do this at home. Two thumbs go in. Just let the clay do the work we're trying to do.

593
01:20:32,430 --> 01:20:41,600
If you need to wet your hands again, absolutely do so. I'm not moving at all. The clay is doing

594
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:55,869
all the work. Simply going down deeper and deeper. Mind-destructing portion of the clay. You see here,

595
01:20:55,869 --> 01:21:04,340
if you got some scraps, give yourself a bucket. It's hard to squeeze sometimes because I can feel

596
01:21:04,340 --> 01:21:12,189
the presence at the beginning. That's okay. How beautiful that is. Your stories are cool, but

597
01:21:12,909 --> 01:21:21,420
how beautiful that is. You should come back. I'm getting deeper down into this clay,

598
01:21:21,420 --> 01:21:30,130
just letting it do the work for me. Do not move during this procedure. You could get seriously

599
01:21:30,130 --> 01:21:52,529
injured. I mean seriously. You have to go to the doctor. Working all the way down. You see,

600
01:21:52,529 --> 01:22:14,659
we have a little portion. Don't touch it, Robert. No shortcuts here. I want that. Let's go look at

601
01:22:14,659 --> 01:22:41,520
that. That's a big one. That's a huge one. Can I zoom in on this? I'm sorry. Just seems appropriate.

602
01:22:57,680 --> 01:23:03,680
And only use this for touching up your piece. I'm putting gentle pressure down.

603
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:15,409
We pay attention to this portion of the clay. I'm just letting it do what it needs to do,

604
01:23:15,409 --> 01:23:28,220
smoothing out the center piece. It is delicious. There we are. Like I said, once every two weeks,

605
01:23:28,220 --> 01:23:36,850
me and all of my friends, we get together and we do it to a point where all of us can present.

606
01:23:36,850 --> 01:23:43,569
And it's not about winning. It's not about winning. Oh, I didn't win. No, who cares if you won?

607
01:23:43,569 --> 01:23:51,659
It's about creating. And that's it. That looks pretty good. We have a nice little piece in the

608
01:23:51,659 --> 01:24:14,960
middle. I can move that. Two fingers down the box. Storing whatever you want in here. Could be

609
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:26,800
cigarettes. Could be cigars. If you have cigarettes, you can go. And remember, it's about constant

610
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:36,079
pressure. It doesn't need to be perfect. I tried to put together something and it didn't

611
01:24:36,079 --> 01:24:52,560
turn out perfectly. Death flows through into the urn. Now, as you see, finishing the urn requires

612
01:24:52,560 --> 01:25:06,079
newt. Finished up choked. Finishing the urn requires newt inside the center. And that's

613
01:25:06,079 --> 01:25:21,859
for display only. The lid is very difficult and you can't make the lid until this portion is

614
01:25:21,859 --> 01:25:36,609
completed. It's like eggs. Weirdly enough, but it's something I enjoy. And don't tell me when

615
01:25:36,609 --> 01:25:46,899
I'm doing this. You shouldn't be making these things. Do you know what day it is today?

616
01:25:47,859 --> 01:26:04,029
No trouble. So as you see here, I have finally crafted an urn that is full of god scar started.

617
01:26:04,989 --> 01:26:22,640
Make the lid. If you put your finger down, just press it. Don't push down here. You will

618
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:42,130
ruin the lid you created. I'm not moving. Edge is turned up a little, but that's okay because

619
01:26:42,130 --> 01:26:49,069
it needs to be just elegant. And elegance can come from destruction. It can come from chaos.

620
01:26:49,149 --> 01:26:50,770
This is the rising wave.

621
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:26,430
Stop, stop, stop. Did you hear it? Sounded like a spirit was flying through. If I could only

622
01:27:26,430 --> 01:27:46,239
catch him. Oh, if I could catch that spirit, he would be in a bad spot. For the lid, I have

623
01:27:46,239 --> 01:27:51,579
two pieces that I'll be making. One is the top and the other is the bottom. This is the bottom.

624
01:27:52,140 --> 01:28:06,260
Me too. Hello. What's the matter? Hold on, he's bitten somebody? Did he actually bite somebody?

625
01:28:07,970 --> 01:28:19,550
Okay, he's eating raw hamburger meat backstage. He doesn't get on the house very much. He doesn't

626
01:28:19,550 --> 01:28:27,970
get up very much. His face is very, very, he's not. It's all right. It's okay. Is it a problem?

627
01:28:27,970 --> 01:28:45,390
Do you need me to go get him? Is anybody injured? Okay, well, just put some hamburger meat on the

628
01:28:45,390 --> 01:28:49,470
ground. I'll go get him. You just put it in a trail over to a hook. You know the traps if they're

629
01:28:49,470 --> 01:28:58,350
making looney tunes? You know the stick that falls down? Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and

630
01:28:58,350 --> 01:29:09,470
gentlemen, I have to be quite short because problems are a little difficult. 15 years, son of a bitch.

631
01:29:11,140 --> 01:29:15,699
I will be back. You don't think you'll never see me again. You'll see me again.

632
01:29:29,600 --> 01:41:09,409
Which one is this? Hello, how are you? I had a little. Hi, welcome back. We're currently set

633
01:41:09,409 --> 01:41:14,800
up right now for the actual main event portion of the stream, which takes actually a little longer

634
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:22,000
than you would think, right? I'll explain what's going to happen here. I am currently for what I'm

635
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:26,000
going to do on the computer because we're trying to figure this out. Like, oh, what the hell are

636
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:31,460
you even going to do? We have a couple of things that I'm going to do for the actions. But if you're

637
01:41:31,460 --> 01:41:36,130
just watching for the first time ever, right now, well, not right now, but when the round starts,

638
01:41:36,130 --> 01:41:45,170
you know, over the last like three weeks, there has been at least three or four hundred actions

639
01:41:45,170 --> 01:41:50,909
that the community has come up with to try to slime me on this broadcast. We have a couple of

640
01:41:50,909 --> 01:41:57,680
angles as we see. And over the course of the next probably 40 to 50 minutes to an hour, we're going

641
01:41:57,680 --> 01:42:03,380
to see if I do any of those actions. I do not know what any of these things are. I have no idea.

642
01:42:03,380 --> 01:42:07,619
I have not been briefed. No one has told me, oh, Jeremy, oh, by the way, the action is say,

643
01:42:07,619 --> 01:42:11,619
look at me. You know, that's like action number one. I have no idea. Hopefully that's not action

644
01:42:11,619 --> 01:42:20,850
one because I just did it. But also at the same time, while I am doing this, you also are going

645
01:42:20,850 --> 01:42:26,539
to be judged because there are actions that if you do them during these rounds without you knowing,

646
01:42:26,539 --> 01:42:32,560
you will lose points. The points that we banked from over there, by the way, Bugleberry was $800.

647
01:42:33,199 --> 01:42:38,739
Just want to make sure everyone's aware of that. It's the worst $800 I've ever spent.

648
01:42:38,739 --> 01:42:45,260
And I absolutely will spend it again next year. So how this works again, each round we're going

649
01:42:45,260 --> 01:42:53,409
to have a series of actions. When those actions happen, if I do one, I have kind of a death trap

650
01:42:53,409 --> 01:42:57,250
up here that is going to slime me. If I do it during the round, you will be aware of those

651
01:42:57,250 --> 01:43:03,470
actions. I will not. Who knows? We're going to keep score. If I get slimed, I lose points. If you

652
01:43:03,470 --> 01:43:08,859
say a word that you're not supposed to say, you lose points too. And we're going to keep track of

653
01:43:08,859 --> 01:43:15,199
them. You may even get banned too like that. That's probably not going to happen. So the game that

654
01:43:15,199 --> 01:43:23,840
I'm going to be playing is plants versus zombies, because that was like the most easy thing to play

655
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:28,060
because it was like, oh, what are we going to play? Oh, I could play a horror game. I played them all.

656
01:43:28,060 --> 01:43:34,689
I could play like a shooter game. I played them all. I could play a, I don't know. We've done

657
01:43:34,689 --> 01:43:38,529
them all, right? So we've done them all. So I'm going to play plants versus zombies while we do

658
01:43:38,529 --> 01:43:48,880
this. And when do we start? Oh, look at that. You can see it. That's coming at me. That's coming for

659
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:54,449
me. That is trying to kill me. Don't you understand? You thought this was all bullshit. You thought this

660
01:43:54,449 --> 01:44:02,510
is a joke. No, we don't do jokes on this stream. We do real, real stuff. It's actually

661
01:44:02,510 --> 01:44:09,920
kind of menacing and there is slime in there. Yes. So I have like a thing. Can we see plants

662
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:16,060
versus zombies? Oh, we're gripping game play. I'm going to play plants versus zombies. Oh,

663
01:44:16,060 --> 01:44:23,100
look at that. It's a tutorial level. This is, this is great. We're recharging. Okay. So when

664
01:44:23,100 --> 01:44:27,359
do we start around? Do we have any idea? Are we, are we going to get like started or should I just

665
01:44:27,359 --> 01:44:36,000
play plants versus zombies for like two hours? How am I losing in the tutorial? Is that one of them?

666
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:40,020
That's not the first one, right? Make sure that's not the first one. I actually am losing.

667
01:44:45,699 --> 01:44:59,630
So that we have the points should come up on screen. Do we have points? I can't even hear

668
01:44:59,630 --> 01:45:06,539
this audio. So instead of secret slime action. Hey, I'm just like a weird guy in the lower

669
01:45:06,539 --> 01:45:14,430
corner of your screen playing plants versus zombies. Oh, I got, I got a bomb that guy.

670
01:45:14,430 --> 01:45:18,670
Imagine waiting for this stream. And it's just like, nah, nah, this is what we're going to do.

671
01:45:18,670 --> 01:45:29,729
I'm just going to play play. That is what we're doing. Let's see how fast I can click it.

672
01:45:29,729 --> 01:45:38,689
The real time killer. See if I can break the record. You know, I should just do that right now

673
01:45:38,689 --> 01:45:44,369
while we fix the technical problems that are going on. Just click as fast as I can. I cannot

674
01:45:44,369 --> 01:45:48,210
even, I actually can't even see chat. So I have no idea what they're saying. They could be saying

675
01:45:48,210 --> 01:45:53,890
anything right now. Well, the guy in the Halloween costume. I'm not even in Halloween costume.

676
01:45:58,930 --> 01:46:04,939
Oh shit. He's not out. Drop it on me. It's not the Halloween costume. So there are,

677
01:46:04,939 --> 01:46:11,819
there actually are like 400 things. If I do them, then I'll be in a lot of trouble. We came back

678
01:46:11,819 --> 01:46:14,539
to the break just because it was like, you know, just put me live. Do it.

679
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:22,880
I have like one of those secret service things. Actually losing in the tutorial. I know what you're

680
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:32,979
saying. And it's true. I actually just lost in the tutorial. I lost in the tutorial.

681
01:46:38,979 --> 01:46:56,270
Well, shit. I'm going to try it again. Whoops. I was just, all right. You put the sunflowers down

682
01:46:56,270 --> 01:47:00,109
and then when the sunflowers, okay, take the sunflower at 25. I remember, I know how this,

683
01:47:00,189 --> 01:47:06,939
the whole back row is sunflowers. And then the next row is the pea shooters, right?

684
01:47:10,260 --> 01:47:13,619
We got doctor, doctor, doctor. Dr. Sparks. Are you still in the house?

685
01:47:14,260 --> 01:47:21,649
I think I need my blood pressure taken. So how are we doing? Are we, are we any closer?

686
01:47:24,220 --> 01:47:32,939
Are we any closer to slime time? Or should I lose in the tutorial again? He's pretending to lose.

687
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:45,520
How many times can I win? I know I haven't played, this is actually a pretty good game.

688
01:47:46,399 --> 01:47:49,920
The second one's stupid, but this one is actually really good.

689
01:47:52,960 --> 01:48:00,859
Just dunk them, dunk them now. We're stalling. I might actually, this is what you do, right?

690
01:48:04,899 --> 01:48:24,960
Works, works. Let me, let me just get a full row. Guy playing plans versus zombies.

691
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:30,159
That's why I baited you all. I baited you all here. We started with that trivia

692
01:48:30,159 --> 01:48:40,529
round into like Bugleberry was here. Now, hey, settle back in the play. This is riveting.

693
01:48:45,699 --> 01:48:48,500
The funny thing is, there's probably some of you here that are like,

694
01:48:49,300 --> 01:48:53,460
now this is great. Just keep doing this. Let's do this for like another six hours.

695
01:48:55,710 --> 01:49:00,159
All right, fine. Whatever. We will. Definitely not six hours.

696
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:23,779
So how are we looking? What'd you say? Secret service. What'd you say?

697
01:49:27,779 --> 01:49:33,020
I've lost, I've lost communication. I've lost communication with the back team.

698
01:49:33,819 --> 01:49:41,920
Wait, we're going? Wait, we're going now? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on. We're going

699
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:49,539
right now. How long have they been there for? What? I thought I was still like, filling time.

700
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:55,939
Oh, now you freaked me the fuck out. Now I'm like, I'm scared. Wait, everything's ready.

701
01:49:57,810 --> 01:50:12,560
What? I thought I was like, filling time still. Okay. So that means I'm armed. Uh, okay.

702
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:22,239
Okay. Let me put a back row. So let me first of all, my back is killing me. Let me just like,

703
01:50:27,039 --> 01:50:33,500
my back is just absolutely killing me. You ever get like a tense back? I mean,

704
01:50:33,500 --> 01:50:46,560
seriously, that's how you get like a bad back. That's how you get a bad back. You sit too long.

705
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:53,119
I was sitting for too long. That's my problem. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I gotta watch out

706
01:50:53,119 --> 01:51:05,840
down here. So wait, I have actions too. I'm sitting there just like, well, who knows if we're

707
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:17,869
starting or not. I hope I don't lose. Oh, I gotta put the onion there. If I put the onion there,

708
01:51:17,869 --> 01:51:26,500
I win. I'm sorry. It's a walnut. I know what it is. Oh shit. Wait, I got one lawn mower down.

709
01:51:26,500 --> 01:51:32,510
The thing is, I'm trying, I don't touch any, I keep, what if I don't touch anything?

710
01:51:35,039 --> 01:51:40,960
How long is the round? How much time do I have in round to like, worry about this?

711
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:58,539
That makes it even worse about knowing because I'm completely in the dark.

712
01:51:58,539 --> 01:52:14,079
Again, let me just like, good shot of him. I almost just dropped it. I almost just dropped it.

713
01:52:19,229 --> 01:52:34,979
Yes. Cherry Bomb. Best gameplay you're going to watch on Twitch of Plants vs. Zombies 1.

714
01:52:36,460 --> 01:52:42,619
We can talk about a quick story about how Plants vs. Zombies 2 took this formula and then they

715
01:52:42,619 --> 01:52:51,779
turned it into a pay to win game that really nobody cares about. It's where people come back

716
01:52:51,779 --> 01:52:56,260
to this game and they talk about how this is like, oh, what a fantastic, awesome game this is.

717
01:52:57,060 --> 01:53:01,300
And the second one is just, I don't think anybody's ever played it. Only like,

718
01:53:04,899 --> 01:53:09,220
I'm just moving. What did I do? Did I, what did I do? It started to, all right, this thing started

719
01:53:09,220 --> 01:53:30,289
to move. So I'm going to stop talking about that. I heard like, I don't know what to say.

720
01:53:31,010 --> 01:53:35,250
When you, when you have like nothing you're allowed to say, you have no words to say.

721
01:53:37,390 --> 01:53:43,789
I could, I could just like say, I don't know. I don't know. I'm scared. You guys, okay.

722
01:53:44,750 --> 01:53:51,390
You just have, oh, there are points. There are the points. I can see them. You guys have,

723
01:53:51,390 --> 01:53:56,109
where'd you guys have 16,000 points from? Oh, from the trivia. Right. That's right.

724
01:53:58,189 --> 01:54:12,720
This game is like, oh, this game is good. I'm trying to think of something. Imagine one of

725
01:54:12,720 --> 01:54:18,989
the actions is play Plants vs. Zombies 1. No, touching the nose is, it might be one of them.

726
01:54:18,989 --> 01:54:27,859
I ain't going to do it. A huge wave is approaching, but from what direction? East? West?

727
01:54:35,819 --> 01:54:51,060
I, how do you get more? No, I have to actually set this up, don't I? I got to be careful because

728
01:54:51,060 --> 01:54:54,579
every time I get, if I get slimed and I lose like, how many points do I lose if I get slimed?

729
01:54:55,939 --> 01:55:00,260
500. That's not good. Well, it's probably not going to happen. So that's fine.

730
01:55:01,380 --> 01:55:04,850
I'll just be quiet the whole time and just actually play this game.

731
01:55:07,840 --> 01:55:20,109
That's what we're doing. I have a lot of money. When is the round end?

732
01:55:20,109 --> 01:55:55,199
Oh, click to remove it. Wow. This is, I love Plants vs. Zombies. Now we're going bowling.

733
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:09,220
I should, I should just like dance on camera. Just dance in action. Oh, it's been to the left.

734
01:56:09,220 --> 01:56:20,210
Right, right, right. Oh, it's bowling. Okay. I would laugh my ass off if this just didn't happen

735
01:56:20,210 --> 01:56:29,220
one time. If this doesn't happen once, I will fucking laugh. Hey, we set all this up and it died.

736
01:56:29,220 --> 01:56:40,140
Nope, not going to happen. This is the big explosion one, right? Oh, by the way,

737
01:56:41,020 --> 01:56:46,109
I got some cool clothes on.

738
01:56:55,779 --> 01:57:02,899
How was your guys Halloween? How was your guys day? Did you guys have a good day? My day was great.

739
01:57:08,460 --> 01:57:16,140
I did, uh, well I did all this. I set all this up and it was really good.

740
01:57:18,430 --> 01:57:23,789
Do you remember, you guys remember when conventions, when people would wear these

741
01:57:23,789 --> 01:57:27,949
to conventions, it was a huge thing. Why would they not make Plants vs. Zombies 3?

742
01:57:28,989 --> 01:57:32,989
Everybody loves this franchise. This is gonna make a mobile game and that's it. Make it free.

743
01:57:32,989 --> 01:57:54,619
Make it a real game. Oh, with ricochets, right. You gotta try to get free. There we are.

744
01:57:58,529 --> 01:58:00,850
Why did I just do that? That was stupid. I gotta hit this guy.

745
01:58:06,220 --> 01:58:09,180
Yes. All right, final wave.

746
01:58:12,859 --> 01:58:20,000
Everybody has this. I remember being at PAX East in like 2012 and they would just be cones.

747
01:58:28,770 --> 01:58:31,810
I'm going to win this. I'm definitely going to win.

748
01:58:35,170 --> 01:58:38,689
All right, if it's not like, oh, touch your nose, touch your face. Look out. Whoa,

749
01:58:38,689 --> 01:58:42,930
what happened to you? Oh, watch it. Watch his bum. Watch out for his bum. I am safe,

750
01:58:42,930 --> 01:58:52,770
I think, this whole round. There's like, yeah, no, call this round. I'm not, it's over. I win.

751
01:58:56,899 --> 01:59:00,579
They didn't get shit. Hey, what was, what was your word by the way?

752
01:59:03,979 --> 01:59:08,859
Their word was diaper. Your word was diaper. How did you do?

753
01:59:08,859 --> 01:59:20,739
You. Minus 800, 840 of you said the word diaper. That means you lose. That means you lose 800

754
01:59:20,739 --> 01:59:34,829
points because one person's worth one point. Nothing happened to me. I'm fine right now.

755
01:59:37,819 --> 01:59:41,199
It was probably something really specific. It was probably like,

756
01:59:43,760 --> 01:59:48,770
talk about Jemercraft. Actually, I probably shouldn't say that word.

757
01:59:48,930 --> 01:59:59,779
So we're officially on the second round in five seconds. We've got the next round, the next round.

758
02:00:01,140 --> 02:00:13,340
I, I thought it was going to be way more than 800. That means I actually cannot get son. How

759
02:00:13,340 --> 02:00:33,149
many people are here? How many people are watching the stream right now? All right. So out of 7,400

760
02:00:33,149 --> 02:00:39,069
people, only 800 of you, I'm wearing a fucking diaper on screen. How did you hope you could

761
02:00:39,069 --> 02:00:45,170
contain that? You could contain yourselves during that? I don't know how that's possible.

762
02:00:47,170 --> 02:00:54,300
Wait, is the word still banned in the chat? No, it's not. Okay. Thank God I unbanned it.

763
02:00:54,300 --> 02:00:59,260
I thought it was still banned. It was banned like two months ago. So we're on round two, right?

764
02:01:00,220 --> 02:01:12,770
So this is new actions, right? Not the old ones or are you compounding them?

765
02:01:17,920 --> 02:01:27,520
All right. So, all right, put my hands down. I'm going to put my hands down.

766
02:01:31,250 --> 02:01:38,979
That means you guys have a new thing too. Watch what you say for the next little bit.

767
02:01:41,600 --> 02:02:00,220
Be careful. Something about like something about my hair is just fucking bothering me.

768
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:11,420
Something about it. I don't know what it is.

769
02:02:14,539 --> 02:02:20,300
Maybe it has to do with the fact that they're right. What are you doing? What did I do? What did I do?

770
02:02:20,300 --> 02:02:22,859
What did I do? What did I do? What did I do? What did I do? What did I do? What did I do? What?

771
02:02:23,659 --> 02:02:37,810
What did I do? What? What did I do? What was the action? I touched my hair.

772
02:02:39,199 --> 02:02:51,810
I touched my hair twice was the action. Well, how many fucking people said that I had? Oh,

773
02:02:51,810 --> 02:02:58,960
for the love of God. Did I just, how many points? 500 points? How am I going to play?

774
02:03:00,739 --> 02:03:04,100
We didn't think this through. We didn't think this through. How am I going to play?

775
02:03:04,979 --> 02:03:14,699
I can't play the game. I can't do anything. My fucking hand cannot come back down here.

776
02:03:15,260 --> 02:03:20,640
Touch your hair twice. Oh, for the love of God. This stuff stinks.

777
02:03:23,729 --> 02:03:29,970
This smells so bad. Does that end? Can we go to the next round? Oh, we keep going.

778
02:03:31,649 --> 02:03:40,369
I need to play with my left hand. Thank you. I just got a towel.

779
02:03:41,090 --> 02:03:52,270
This is my eye. This stuff, this smells like baby puke. I don't know why I know that. It

780
02:03:52,270 --> 02:04:00,859
just smells like baby puke. Am I losing it in the game? I'm not even paying attention.

781
02:04:01,979 --> 02:04:17,060
All right. I need to, okay. We're good. The thing is I heard, I heard like the crank

782
02:04:17,060 --> 02:04:22,770
and that's when I was like, what the fuck happened? What's the score? 11, what is it? 11 what?

783
02:04:23,489 --> 02:04:32,449
1100. Okay. I didn't lose it. I won actually. That's good. The thing, this is going to be

784
02:04:32,449 --> 02:04:39,090
horrible. Honestly, I'm not kidding around after one. Cool. Let's not ever do that again,

785
02:04:39,090 --> 02:04:48,220
because now like I feel like shit. Let me fill this back up. Oh, we're still on that same round?

786
02:04:48,859 --> 02:05:07,119
Good thing I'm wearing a diaper. All right. I got the, I got the ice snow pea. So Jesus Christ.

787
02:05:11,649 --> 02:05:18,350
Oh, don't touch my face, right? Oh, touch my hair. Should I not touch anything? But what if I have

788
02:05:18,350 --> 02:05:36,460
to rub my face? Cause there's slime in my eyes. All right. How does it look? This shit's not even,

789
02:05:36,460 --> 02:05:46,689
this is not even orange. It's like fucking, it's like, it's like white. It's supposed to be orange,

790
02:05:47,250 --> 02:05:55,149
but I don't think it doesn't. Is it because of the light? It looks like it's like pale.

791
02:05:56,029 --> 02:05:58,029
It should have been a green. That would have been better.

792
02:06:03,100 --> 02:06:20,380
I need like, it's like, it's hardening in my like ear canal. Hey, welcome to the,

793
02:06:20,380 --> 02:06:38,140
hey, welcome everybody to the stream. I gotta, I, all right. What do you, I, what do they have?

794
02:06:38,140 --> 02:06:48,750
Okay. Can you pump it to me what they have for action? So this round is over. The word was

795
02:06:48,750 --> 02:06:53,630
bald, by the way, but apparently in doing so, I had to touch my head twice, which is technically

796
02:06:53,630 --> 02:06:57,069
my hair, but it's not really my hair. So that's a technicality. I don't believe that that should

797
02:06:57,069 --> 02:07:05,439
be allowed. Do you guys have a timer up? Just going by, you know what? I can see the chat.

798
02:07:06,239 --> 02:07:18,979
Why is everybody saying he said orange? What do you mean? He, what are you talking about?

799
02:07:18,979 --> 02:07:24,819
He just said it. Orange is, orange is one of the words.

800
02:07:33,279 --> 02:07:42,899
Somebody just shit in my pants. Somebody shit my pants. I didn't do it, but somebody else very

801
02:07:42,899 --> 02:07:55,890
clearly did. Holy shit. The word was orange. I talked about how this didn't look orange.

802
02:08:03,340 --> 02:08:08,460
Can we, can we like watch a movie or something? Because I can't even, I can't even touch the

803
02:08:08,460 --> 02:08:20,689
screen. I can't touch anything. Are we on a new round? I just got an achievement. Watch rat movie.

804
02:08:22,210 --> 02:08:29,859
No, that's probably an action. Actually, it's going to happen with playing Plants

805
02:08:29,859 --> 02:08:33,380
vs. Zombies because like there's no way I could have done anything else. Oh dude, what the fuck?

806
02:08:33,380 --> 02:08:44,159
You should be playing like Soma. Yeah. Should I? I'm sticking to the ground. Jesus.

807
02:08:49,090 --> 02:09:03,260
Your hair looks dumb. Wait, I didn't do anything. Are we on a new round? We're on a new round,

808
02:09:03,260 --> 02:09:06,060
right? I just like burped really loudly and hopefully that's not something.

809
02:09:06,859 --> 02:09:11,630
What am I doing? I gotta, I gotta get rid of this guy. It's hard to even grab.

810
02:09:12,350 --> 02:09:23,039
Oh, you guys don't understand. I don't have a mouse pad. It's slime here. Slime is my mouse pad.

811
02:09:24,399 --> 02:09:34,659
I think like, really? How am I going to do this? Wait, wait, wait, wait. No, no, no, no. I can't

812
02:09:34,659 --> 02:09:37,460
lose. I can't lose. I can't lose. I can't lose. I can't lose. I can't lose. Don't lose. Don't lose.

813
02:09:37,460 --> 02:09:47,090
Please don't lose. I'm going to lose. Look, you don't have to deal with somebody getting slimed.

814
02:09:47,090 --> 02:09:54,609
I do. I have to deal with somebody sliming my ass. It's actually in like the back of my underwear

815
02:09:54,609 --> 02:09:59,649
and every time I get up and get down, it's like, it's the worst feeling ever. What's,

816
02:09:59,649 --> 02:10:04,210
what are we slated to do here? Like an hour and a half. Uh, just kidding. More like 25 minutes.

817
02:10:04,850 --> 02:10:18,829
See you guys next time. Cut his mic. If I lean over good enough, I can see. All right. So

818
02:10:22,689 --> 02:10:30,609
here we go. New round, new time. Let's do it. I have to at least win one round.

819
02:10:30,609 --> 02:10:43,250
Did they, how many? Okay. So it's 10. What is it? 10? What is it? I can't see it from there.

820
02:10:43,250 --> 02:10:52,449
10 what? We're, we're, we're in a new round, right? Am I on actually new actions right now?

821
02:10:53,170 --> 02:10:57,020
People are spamming show the actions, show actions. I don't even know what they are.

822
02:10:59,260 --> 02:11:02,779
Oh, new actions are going up now. I think I'm just playing, playing for zombies.

823
02:11:03,500 --> 02:11:10,210
I think. Well, show actions, show actions, show actions. There we go.

824
02:11:11,010 --> 02:11:13,250
Do they, we haven't, are they up? Okay.

825
02:11:28,020 --> 02:11:52,399
Spitters. Hey, mine. How long does the arm take to mine? 20 seconds. 25. This is so unnerving

826
02:11:53,279 --> 02:11:56,800
because I just hear like production people like going like this. I hear them like

827
02:11:59,680 --> 02:12:07,579
they're like moving around back there. All that happens is you guys lose points. What happens to

828
02:12:07,579 --> 02:12:11,819
me is somebody goes to the bathroom in the back of my underwear as it happens to me.

829
02:12:12,699 --> 02:12:37,579
I'd rather have it hit me in the face. Seriously. I have to win this. I'm starting to harden.

830
02:12:43,979 --> 02:12:53,260
All right. I need to take care of this guy. Okay. Look at how covered I am in shit. I am from like

831
02:12:53,340 --> 02:13:00,699
up to down. Let's get you a towel. Let's get you a towel. This is like a face cloth.

832
02:13:28,800 --> 02:13:35,310
Don't lose again. The gameplay is what matters on this stream. Nothing else matters. Only the

833
02:13:35,310 --> 02:13:45,039
video game is being shown. What's going on? What's wrong with the computer? Just blue screen. Wait.

834
02:13:45,039 --> 02:13:52,720
Oh, wait. The computer blue screen. What? Oh shit. That's an action. That's an action for the

835
02:13:52,720 --> 02:14:09,949
computer. Oh, God damn it. Oh, what the fuck? Oh, I was like, what's going on here? It's like

836
02:14:09,949 --> 02:14:25,810
smoking. The computer is smoking from the back. It's smoking. How many points does the computer

837
02:14:25,810 --> 02:14:37,279
lose? How many points did the computer have? Is it all right? Somebody reboot it. Can you reboot

838
02:14:37,279 --> 02:14:51,180
it? If you hit control, I'll delete on it. See if it works. Let's see. No, I'm not getting anything

839
02:14:51,180 --> 02:15:15,100
from this PC. Should I blow on it? Damn. Okay. What do we do? Okay. Because that's actually like

840
02:15:15,100 --> 02:15:23,069
this thing's dead. I'll have my iPad. Do you want to bring up my iPad? Okay. I'll get my iPad.

841
02:15:24,210 --> 02:22:22,719
We can play something on the iPad for a while. I'm Jerma and now we're going to play iPad games

842
02:22:22,719 --> 02:22:29,950
because that's what we have. Yeah, it's not just you and me. It's the computer as well as involved

843
02:22:29,950 --> 02:22:34,909
in this. This is actually caking. It's an iPad stream. This it is. You didn't think we were going

844
02:22:34,909 --> 02:22:41,069
to come back to this, but we always do. So where do we stand on points? I am currently losing

845
02:22:41,069 --> 02:22:50,639
because I went to the bathroom during the trivia. I had a long piss. It was about four minutes.

846
02:22:51,440 --> 02:23:01,010
But we have right here in our hands Halloween themed horror games. And we are going to start

847
02:23:01,010 --> 02:23:09,299
with one called Spirit Oracle Board. If you don't have TikTok, now's the time to get it.

848
02:23:11,059 --> 02:23:17,520
There are ads on this. I'm going to do it. The scary stories. I'm not going to click that. It's

849
02:23:17,520 --> 02:23:23,360
going to open up like a webpage. All right. Start the seance. Okay. We got a full page TikTok ad.

850
02:23:28,690 --> 02:23:35,940
Okay. Instructions. Can we get some ambience in here? If possible, darken the room. You are in

851
02:23:36,899 --> 02:23:44,899
and light some candles before starting a seance. Place your finger on the planchette.

852
02:23:45,459 --> 02:23:51,790
Is that the term? The wooden piece in order to initiate the spiritual connection to the other

853
02:23:51,790 --> 02:23:57,389
side. Ask the spirit your question loud and clear. Always start a seance with a question,

854
02:23:57,389 --> 02:24:02,899
is anyone there? Wait for the spirit. This is a lot of, this is a huge amount of questions.

855
02:24:05,489 --> 02:24:10,930
This is a huge amount of instructions here, not questions. Wait for the spirit to respond. The

856
02:24:10,930 --> 02:24:15,889
planchette will start moving. Okay. Always be polite and ask normal questions. This is a way

857
02:24:15,889 --> 02:24:22,110
to make it so kids don't say anything bad. Right? Don't say anything mean. Don't say fuck. Be careful

858
02:24:22,110 --> 02:24:29,409
not to upset any spirit. A couple running around here today actually. In case you have anger to

859
02:24:29,409 --> 02:24:33,889
spirit, quickly move the planchette to goodbye before the countdown is over or unexplained

860
02:24:33,889 --> 02:24:45,090
things might happen. Sure. Speech recognition required. Do we actually have to do this? Do I

861
02:24:45,090 --> 02:24:53,389
have to do, do I have to allow speech recognition? I don't want this like, you talk, you can always

862
02:24:53,389 --> 02:25:01,569
change this later. Okay. So I allow access, right? Are we good? Spirit would like to access speech

863
02:25:01,569 --> 02:25:09,139
recognition. Okay. Why does it need to know all this stuff? Listen to your microphone. Okay.

864
02:25:11,299 --> 02:25:22,370
Turbo seance. Unlock these special features. Turbo seance. Messages will, no, no, thank you.

865
02:25:22,370 --> 02:25:26,370
I don't think I need to do the turbo seance. Place fingers on the planchette to start.

866
02:25:26,370 --> 02:25:33,409
Do we have any scary music going here? We do? Okay. Place finger on planchette to start. You've

867
02:25:33,409 --> 02:25:49,899
got it? Ask. I don't know what to ask. Do you, are there any spirits here? Are there any spirits here?

868
02:25:58,899 --> 02:26:28,670
Are there any spirits here? Are, are there any spirits here? Oh shit. You're going to see me

869
02:26:28,670 --> 02:26:43,969
doing this. This thing sucks. What? Hello. Let's try it again. Warning. Seance in progress. If

870
02:26:43,969 --> 02:26:55,010
you've made contact with a spirit, you should end the seance by moving to the goodbye. Exit. I love

871
02:26:55,170 --> 02:27:02,719
how you, I love how you cut that. I saw you go, but look, no, no, no. Come back. Come back.

872
02:27:02,719 --> 02:27:10,590
They're doing it. They're doing it. Look, that's like G. Oh no. So you got the bomb. Oh shoot.

873
02:27:11,739 --> 02:27:18,059
Oh shit. What monster is this going to summon? Oh, the rainbow. That means you got five.

874
02:27:18,780 --> 02:27:24,940
Give me a fucking, no, I don't know. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. I don't want to,

875
02:27:24,940 --> 02:27:28,079
I'm going to try this one more time and then move on to the next fucking iPad game. No, thanks.

876
02:27:28,319 --> 02:27:48,510
Place. Okay. Are you here? This thing even, does this even do anything? Do we know if this even do

877
02:27:48,510 --> 02:27:57,540
anything? I don't think this does anything. This is fucking stupid. All right. I'm going to hit the

878
02:27:57,540 --> 02:28:03,250
button and we're going to do another one because, okay, I'm going to hit the button. That's the end

879
02:28:03,250 --> 02:28:15,260
of the round for chat. The word, what? The word was turbo. How many points did they lose? Holy shit.

880
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:25,069
That's some next level baiting if I've ever seen it. All right. Do I want you to show? Okay.

881
02:28:25,069 --> 02:28:40,620
This is granny two is this one. This is granny chapter two. So do I have new actions?

882
02:28:41,420 --> 02:28:54,719
I didn't do anything, right? We're going to keep the same one. All right. We're going to do normal.

883
02:28:57,709 --> 02:29:05,040
Granny play as options. That's fine. Normal quality. Granny and grandpa move at normal speed.

884
02:29:05,120 --> 02:29:11,170
That's fine. Be quiet. Granny hears everything. Grandpa doesn't hear very well, but he hits hard.

885
02:29:14,399 --> 02:29:17,680
Press and hold the remove button to free yourself from bear traps.

886
02:29:17,680 --> 02:29:21,440
Hiding under beds or in wardrobes. You have five days. It's a long time. Use headphones.

887
02:29:21,440 --> 02:29:32,690
My best experience. I don't, I can't do that. So how many actions do we have for chat right now?

888
02:29:33,250 --> 02:29:57,120
Do I, is it, is it, is it like a gyro? Oh wow. This is so scary. What's the goal here?

889
02:29:57,680 --> 02:30:02,780
Do I just have to stay away from granny? Why are there spikes in this? Wait, if I go in here,

890
02:30:02,780 --> 02:30:12,879
is this going to kill me? Is this an iron maiden? Oh, you can crouch too. All right. So what do I

891
02:30:12,879 --> 02:30:18,319
do? This is granny chapter two, by the way. If you don't know, this is the number one downloaded

892
02:30:18,319 --> 02:30:26,049
game on the whole app store. I don't know why granny is just number one on the, it's just,

893
02:30:26,049 --> 02:30:39,680
there's like 700,000 reviews for this game as well. Wait a minute. Can I open this? I just spit on

894
02:30:39,680 --> 02:30:45,120
this, but I've had slime up my nose for the last like 40 minutes. So does it really matter?

895
02:30:45,440 --> 02:31:05,440
Oh, I spit it. Where the hell am I? What? Is the slime yummy? Is that what you're asking?

896
02:31:06,750 --> 02:31:16,819
Uh, not particularly. It just, it's, it just smells like, like baby formula. Is it actually

897
02:31:16,819 --> 02:31:26,420
edible? I think it is, right? No. I, what'd I just do that for? No, I can't touch this.

898
02:31:28,879 --> 02:31:37,340
Is the slime yummy? Is that a trick question? It might be. So now I know. Don't put the slime

899
02:31:37,340 --> 02:31:43,420
in your mouth. That's one of the, I know one of the actions now. I got a man on the inside.

900
02:31:43,420 --> 02:31:51,760
The shower tonight that I take is going to be the best shower I've taken in my whole life. All

901
02:31:51,760 --> 02:32:01,090
right. What am I supposed to do? No, I haven't gotten any in the mouth because it went back.

902
02:32:01,649 --> 02:32:09,059
I've only been slimed twice. I've been slimed two times. I think I'm good. And one of them was

903
02:32:09,059 --> 02:32:18,319
bullshit because I had to point to my head twice. So I need a key in granny's house. Oh, this game.

904
02:32:18,959 --> 02:32:22,639
Wait, I can't see. Can I talk shit about like the most popular game in the app store?

905
02:32:22,639 --> 02:32:30,079
I probably can't, right? Like, can I say like granny sucks? I can't. That, that there's like

906
02:32:30,079 --> 02:32:37,100
800,000 people that disagree with me. So I'm wrong, right? I don't even know where I'm supposed to be

907
02:32:37,100 --> 02:32:54,639
going. Back upstairs? And what did, what killed me the first time? Can I turn the brightness up on

908
02:32:54,639 --> 02:33:02,340
the iPad? All right. I, I, I'm going to put, I'm going to turn the brightness up. It's pretty low.

909
02:33:02,340 --> 02:33:10,959
I can't see that. All right. Now I can see it was so, it was really low. Now I can see. All right.

910
02:33:10,959 --> 02:33:18,430
We're good. Now I think it was so dark. All right. I'm upstairs. Okay. There's there. I am assuming

911
02:33:18,430 --> 02:33:37,700
that was granny. There was just people in granny's house. What does he know? Like how do I peel?

912
02:33:38,850 --> 02:33:47,659
How do you feel? How do you feel? It looks like, Oh, I'm going to peel. Sure. No, don't click the

913
02:33:47,659 --> 02:33:59,139
ad. Don't click the ad. Don't click the ad. All right. Well, it's time for me to peel, I guess.

914
02:33:59,139 --> 02:34:09,579
Let's go choose my peeler. I think that's a good one up here. Nope. Nope. No, no, no, no, no.

915
02:34:09,579 --> 02:34:16,219
I'm not going to do that. I'm stuck to the ground. When I stand up, we're carving a pumpkin soon.

916
02:34:16,219 --> 02:34:25,549
Oh, that might be a slippery action. That may be, don't say it. He's doing a pumpkin carving.

917
02:34:29,760 --> 02:34:37,329
No, I can't, but we're doing a pumpkin carving after that, after this. So there's more to see.

918
02:34:38,430 --> 02:34:43,940
I, I think I'm done playing granny. So I am going to move on to the next one because granny is pretty,

919
02:34:43,940 --> 02:34:48,579
it's just, it's just granny and the other person in the house and they attack you.

920
02:34:49,860 --> 02:34:56,989
Okay. Good old iPad horror games that I don't know how to accomplish anything in them.

921
02:34:56,989 --> 02:35:00,670
I also don't have audio, so that's another thing you guys maybe not, maybe might not know.

922
02:35:01,469 --> 02:35:06,659
You guys might not know that. I guess I can sneak. I'll try one more time.

923
02:35:06,659 --> 02:35:11,700
Well, that's the death room. I probably have like, hold on, let me fix my nerd neck.

924
02:35:11,700 --> 02:35:18,579
I don't want to have like nerd neck, but how do you, okay. I'm dead again. All right. So granny is

925
02:35:18,579 --> 02:35:32,770
a fun game and she's a wonderful, wonderful person. This five, should I just do all five days? I'm

926
02:35:32,770 --> 02:35:38,659
going to go to the next game because this is just stupid. All right. Round over or are we still

927
02:35:38,659 --> 02:35:49,299
going to stay with whatever we have here? Keep it up for a little bit on here. Oh, cause this,

928
02:35:49,299 --> 02:35:57,700
cause this game sucks. All right. New game. Uh, how about, how about scary butcher 3d,

929
02:35:57,700 --> 02:36:08,020
new actions, new game. All right. How about scary butcher 3d? That one looks pretty good play.

930
02:36:08,260 --> 02:36:11,340
Chad says that you violated one.

931
02:36:11,340 --> 02:36:18,030
What do you mean I violated one? What do you mean I, what do you mean I violated one?

932
02:36:18,030 --> 02:36:28,620
People saying rigged. What do you, what do you mean cheated rigged? What are you talking about?

933
02:36:28,620 --> 02:36:52,530
What? Well, you can't just like retroactively add a slime because you, we didn't do it. I just like

934
02:36:52,530 --> 02:36:59,389
backed up. I was like, okay, I guess I'll put that. So what, what do you mean hand motions?

935
02:37:05,729 --> 02:37:22,260
So what? Okay. All right. Well, I, I'm just going to say, I have to, okay, I have an idea.

936
02:37:22,260 --> 02:37:33,620
I have to keep my fucking hands down. So in the small town of Erie, they lived a butcher

937
02:37:33,620 --> 02:37:38,340
bee with his wife. One stormy night, Elena got, I'm stuck to the back of the chair. I'm stuck to the

938
02:37:38,340 --> 02:37:45,739
back of the chair. Can you see this? I'm at, I'm actually stuck to the back of the chair. Who cares

939
02:37:45,739 --> 02:37:51,040
about the butcher's life? Since then, he cooks all kinds of sausages. Who gives a shit about

940
02:37:51,040 --> 02:38:03,659
the butcher? I'm stuck to the chair. Since then, his pets keep vanishing all around. I can hear it

941
02:38:03,659 --> 02:38:10,540
being refilled and it's seriously causing me a lot of anxiety. Since then, the pets keep vanishing

942
02:38:10,540 --> 02:38:14,379
all around town. Some believe it's the butcher who captures and eats the pets. This guy's fucking

943
02:38:14,379 --> 02:38:28,670
crazy. Okay. You know, when you watch a cartoon and there's always that like weird part of the

944
02:38:28,670 --> 02:38:33,950
cartoon where, or no, you know, I'll put it this way. Um, men in black, right? I got, and like in

945
02:38:33,950 --> 02:38:38,370
every men in black movie, I've been eaten by the alien and then spit out, you know, like,

946
02:38:40,450 --> 02:38:46,450
what the fuck? I'm the guy that got eaten and spit out by the alien. I think I'm doing pretty

947
02:38:46,450 --> 02:39:00,770
well. Okay. I'm the person that gets regurgitated. Okay. Let's continue. Your cat fuzzball went

948
02:39:00,770 --> 02:39:05,969
missing yesterday. Could be captured by bee. The butcher's hill is heavily protected by alarms.

949
02:39:05,969 --> 02:39:19,340
So you have to be careful. This person stole my cat. Press button to throw the stone. Hold follow

950
02:39:19,340 --> 02:39:23,020
arrows to reach destination. When we throw the stone, why did I do that? What was the point of

951
02:39:23,020 --> 02:39:36,500
that? Keep your fucking hands down here. No, no, like download now promotion. Well done. Level

952
02:39:36,500 --> 02:39:42,559
completed. Walked in a straight line. It was a close call and I'm still going to compute. Okay.

953
02:39:42,559 --> 02:39:55,020
It's good that you managed to hide or you could be his next victim. Breaking to beat. Then that

954
02:39:55,020 --> 02:40:06,690
game look fun. Right. Cool. No, don't watch the whole ad. I can't even click the X. Okay.

955
02:40:06,690 --> 02:40:16,260
Stop opening the fucking app store. Okay. Breaking to be shed and steal his night vision goggles.

956
02:40:16,260 --> 02:40:40,079
Use this button to toggle display. That's him in the corner. Can he not see me? Oh, there he is.

957
02:40:40,079 --> 02:40:46,670
Look out. Oh no. He got you. And he just goes like, he just like dances. Oops. Butcher caught you

958
02:40:46,670 --> 02:40:55,649
red handed restart. Here's that shooter game. You know, I can't, this is that shooter game for you

959
02:40:55,649 --> 02:41:12,700
kids. I can't hit the X. We just have to let it play out. Oh no, no, no. It's like opening,

960
02:41:12,700 --> 02:41:16,579
like to actually opening the app store. We have to move on. All right. We're going to do

961
02:41:16,579 --> 02:41:27,069
horror clones. Are we on a new round? Same round. New round. Okay. Uh, the iPad is upside down

962
02:41:27,069 --> 02:41:34,899
because the game crashed. So we're going to pick a different one. How about evil nun? Evil nun? Uh,

963
02:41:34,899 --> 02:41:53,170
evil nun might also be broken too. Evil nun doesn't work. How about, uh, Emily? How about Emily? Do

964
02:41:53,170 --> 02:42:02,690
you work, Emily? We'll find out. Emily wants to play a new game. Holy shit, it actually works.

965
02:42:02,690 --> 02:42:11,100
And what are we going to get into the ad? Oh, of course we are. Here it comes. No, this is actually

966
02:42:11,100 --> 02:42:39,219
has a cut scene. Oof. Uh, did you see that? This is, I have, okay, this has been fucking stupid.

967
02:42:39,219 --> 02:42:50,479
The iPad segment was a bust. Interact. Although I still have, what was chat's word? What does chat

968
02:42:51,040 --> 02:43:12,959
have for a word last time? Ass. Okay. Well, sorry to hear that you guys lost so many points.

969
02:43:12,959 --> 02:43:30,079
Why was it ass? Ooh, hold on. What's on the computer? What's on the computer? Let's get a zoom in.

970
02:43:32,750 --> 02:43:45,729
Thanks for what? Thanks for ordering. I don't know what I ordered. Thanks a lot. Okay. Uh,

971
02:43:45,729 --> 02:43:59,180
can I go on? Oh, that's a hint. Wait, I can just turn the lights off in the whole house?

972
02:44:01,469 --> 02:44:11,579
Oh, let's play at midnight says one guy. Sure. I'll try. All right. This game sucks too. I'm going

973
02:44:11,579 --> 02:44:23,469
to just carve the pumpkin. This game sucks. No, it doesn't. That's not fair. That's not fair.

974
02:44:23,469 --> 02:44:33,459
That's not fair. Let me give it like another 30 seconds. Look, tap center to interact with objects.

975
02:44:34,020 --> 02:44:40,850
This game actually is for an iPad game is pretty good. Let me turn the lights back on. Hold on.

976
02:44:40,850 --> 02:44:52,290
Can I leave the house? The slime has caked underneath my head. I want to so badly take

977
02:44:52,290 --> 02:45:01,120
this off, but I can't because if it happens again, then it, this is real life. I want you to get this

978
02:45:01,120 --> 02:45:12,670
like, look at this. This is, it's like glued to my forehead. If I take this off and I get slimed

979
02:45:12,670 --> 02:45:30,690
again, I will be very upset. I ain't taking the bald cap off. Does anybody know anything about

980
02:45:30,690 --> 02:45:40,829
these games? I just heard dump it. And why are we dumping it? I'm not going to, don't look up into

981
02:45:40,829 --> 02:45:49,729
it. What do you mean? I'm going to get in my eyes. Close your eyes. Holy shit. This is disgusting.

982
02:45:50,590 --> 02:46:04,079
You put extra in this one. Okay. Oh my God. That's, that is, this is vile. I'm trying to be,

983
02:46:04,079 --> 02:46:25,860
I'm trying to be normal about this. It smells, it smells like acid. What smells like, but

984
02:46:26,260 --> 02:46:34,219
over exaggerated detail. That's not, that's a real life. That's an over-exaggerating.

985
02:46:38,860 --> 02:46:47,059
No, there's no glue in this. It's just eco-friendly slime. Oh my God. I just saw.

986
02:46:49,440 --> 02:46:54,399
Hey, remember I met in black when the guy gets like fucking puked up. The guy pukes and he's like,

987
02:46:54,399 --> 02:47:03,549
it's me. What's that? Don't do it. Move. Mom, if you're watching, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, mom.

988
02:47:03,549 --> 02:47:14,819
I really don't mean to be like this. I have to take this off. Where's the pumpkin? I still have

989
02:47:14,819 --> 02:51:31,340
the diaper on. Nice watch. Hi, welcome back. Welcome. Right now, we're going to do a thing.

990
02:51:32,139 --> 02:51:36,430
We're going to do a thing where I carve a pumpkin. By the way, the diaper has to stay on

991
02:51:37,229 --> 02:51:42,829
because if the diaper comes off, the pants do too, because they're way down to a point where I,

992
02:51:43,309 --> 02:51:49,229
I have to keep them on. Let me get rid. I have like, okay, this is, I'm making it worse.

993
02:51:51,329 --> 02:51:58,319
So as you see here, we have a regular size pumpkin. I'm going to draw a stencil on him.

994
02:52:01,219 --> 02:52:13,540
I look really bad. Really bad. In fact, like, so as we see here, I've, I don't, I don't know shit

995
02:52:13,540 --> 02:52:17,780
about carving pumpkin. I'm realizing this right now. Oh, what do we want to do to like do the,

996
02:52:17,780 --> 02:52:23,420
what's, how do you want to end this, this like show? I'll carve a pumpkin. Okay. I don't know

997
02:52:23,420 --> 02:52:30,590
how the fuck to do that. So where, what are you doing? What are you doing? What'd I do?

998
02:52:31,309 --> 02:52:38,989
I swear, did I say the word pumpkin? The word pumpkin. You're going to set me up with a segment

999
02:52:38,989 --> 02:52:44,479
where I get a pumpkin and I say the word pumpkin and that's a problem. So that's not fair.

1000
02:52:44,479 --> 02:53:10,690
How's that fair? Okay. I can't just, the pumpkin is gone. I can say the word pumpkin now. Okay.

1001
02:53:12,659 --> 02:53:20,819
So I'm going to draw a stencil here. Can you see that? That's my stencil. Okay.

1002
02:53:25,170 --> 02:53:31,010
Okay. There are knives of now around. There are knives. I'm going to move the knives over here

1003
02:53:31,010 --> 02:53:49,010
because these are knives. Okay. So, you know, why don't I just punch it? Okay. You guys have no

1004
02:53:49,010 --> 02:53:53,809
fuck. This is like a challenge on a game show, which is pretty much what this is.

1005
02:53:54,610 --> 02:54:01,649
I'm going to have to get up with my hands because there's fucking slime everywhere here.

1006
02:54:01,649 --> 02:54:21,409
So why would you give somebody a knife when they're standing on ice? This is a challenge.

1007
02:54:25,600 --> 02:55:00,260
I can't get in with my nails. Okay. That's unsafe. It's unsafe. All right. We got a vacuum.

1008
02:55:21,680 --> 02:55:30,770
That's not, that's not a risk. Okay. The word is not vacuum. I just don't want to be harmed on

1009
02:55:30,770 --> 02:55:40,340
spring. That's not the word. Is it the word? No, it's actually not vacuum. That's too bad.

1010
02:55:41,059 --> 02:56:29,979
Oh, that's better. That's better. Okay. Anybody want a pumpkin? It's not that I've never carved

1011
02:56:29,979 --> 02:56:37,420
a pumpkin. I just don't want to. Hold on. All right. Here's what we're going to do. I'm going to make

1012
02:56:37,979 --> 02:56:47,389
let's go like this. Wait a minute. The hammer, the hammer with the hammer. Where's the hammer?

1013
02:56:47,389 --> 02:56:53,340
The hammer with the like, literally nobody on production knows what I'm trying to say.

1014
02:56:53,340 --> 02:57:03,219
The hammer with the little nails that light up. The chisel. I can do that.

1015
02:57:15,860 --> 02:57:21,120
Scary. All right. That this works. No, I don't have to worry about it. I'm going to make a,

1016
02:57:21,120 --> 02:57:33,020
I'm going to make a face. Is it a real pumpkin? What do you mean is this a real pumpkin?

1017
02:57:33,020 --> 02:57:42,290
Like this is a real pumpkin. Look at the stem. I can see. Oh, I just have to squint real hard,

1018
02:57:42,290 --> 02:57:49,920
but I can see what you said. This frame's pre-recorded. Oh, is it? Would it be

1019
02:57:49,920 --> 02:57:59,620
pre-recorded if I went like this? It's a fake stream. Just wait a minute. Let me just get this

1020
02:57:59,620 --> 02:58:05,940
because I know what your, I know what your, where's the, there it is. Oh, let me go.

1021
02:58:05,940 --> 02:58:18,260
Doctor, how am I doing? Oh, I'm doing just fine. All right. That works.

1022
02:58:21,860 --> 02:58:46,319
I'm going to hit my fucking hand with this. That, okay. We're getting there. I can't even

1023
02:58:46,319 --> 02:58:55,010
pick it up. Okay. What about, hold on like this. I am making something. The face I'm going to make

1024
02:58:55,809 --> 02:59:04,500
is going to be a very special guest. You might find this thing at the circus. You might find

1025
02:59:04,500 --> 02:59:15,569
this thing at a birthday party. Ow. I need like red. I need like purple. We actually had one of

1026
02:59:15,569 --> 02:59:27,489
these on stream. Uh, actually two of them. So that was red. I can't even get in there. Okay.

1027
02:59:27,489 --> 02:59:31,889
That looks fucking terrible. It looks like somebody just put three pegs into a pumpkin.

1028
02:59:31,889 --> 02:59:52,420
We're getting there. Great. I can't, I've done this first. You got to get it in like, there we go.

1029
02:59:52,420 --> 02:59:58,270
You know, don't even, why am I even hitting it like this? Just press it in. I'm using it like

1030
02:59:58,270 --> 03:00:03,069
it's an actual mallet. This thing weighs like four, like maybe four ounces. My pants aren't

1031
03:00:03,069 --> 03:00:08,739
falling down, right? Okay. That's just the diaper. I thought that was my underwear. I actually thought

1032
03:00:08,739 --> 03:00:42,670
that was my actual underwear. This is Jeremy gets hurt on stream. Don't try this at home. It

1033
03:00:42,670 --> 03:00:52,110
ain't going in there. It's going to have to go somewhere else. We should have just had somebody

1034
03:00:52,110 --> 03:01:00,750
make one. We should have had somebody make one of these. Hey, can somebody carve a cool pumpkin?

1035
03:01:01,709 --> 03:01:11,569
I'm not, I'm, I just, I'm not going to do that. Let's do it with my hands. It's way easier.

1036
03:01:12,610 --> 03:01:28,049
Fuck off. Can these be eyes? No, there's no red. Guys, I'm having trouble. What's that thing?

1037
03:01:28,610 --> 03:01:34,719
You have no idea how to do this? No, I do. It's, it's with knife. It's with knives.

1038
03:01:36,059 --> 03:01:42,379
And I'm, I am no, I, I am slippery. I am that's like my superpower right now. You want the slippery

1039
03:01:42,379 --> 03:02:05,790
guy to hold the knife? What? That actually felt pretty good. Hold up more than three fingers.

1040
03:02:06,590 --> 03:02:15,469
Have I, how have I not done that before? He's not reacting. Don't, he's bad. React. React harder.

1041
03:02:15,469 --> 03:02:25,649
React harder. Halloween. No, I, oh, for saying clown, you guys lose points. That's the end of

1042
03:02:25,649 --> 03:02:33,340
the round. You said clown. He didn't react. No, cause at some point it just becomes like numb.

1043
03:02:33,340 --> 03:02:36,459
You know what I mean? At some point, like I, it's happened so many times. It's like, okay,

1044
03:02:36,459 --> 03:02:44,590
I guess it's happening again. You guys said clown. What the fuck am I even doing this? What? This is

1045
03:02:44,590 --> 03:02:50,030
like a, okay, this is like a map to where you've been. You know, you have this shit in like your

1046
03:02:50,030 --> 03:02:54,829
living room to make like your friends jealous. Oh, I've been to Canada. I've been to Toronto.

1047
03:02:54,829 --> 03:03:00,750
And then I, I've been over here, up here into the great lakes down here. Oh yeah. I love Oklahoma.

1048
03:03:00,750 --> 03:03:14,860
Are you doing it again? Oh, I was like, what the fuck? Um, how do I get in this? Can this be taken

1049
03:03:14,860 --> 03:03:21,860
off? This is like bad, right? Can I like pull this off? Audio and video are now out of sync,

1050
03:03:21,860 --> 03:03:31,979
apparently. Why, why is that? He doesn't know. He didn't react. What? I mean, how does he not know?

1051
03:03:31,979 --> 03:03:45,020
What are you talking about? What? What did I not do? We have to get their points down by the way.

1052
03:03:45,020 --> 03:03:55,700
I, I, okay. Lightning round put up 15 actions for me and like 10 actions for chat. Don't tell him.

1053
03:03:55,700 --> 03:04:01,020
Hollow out the pumpkin. We didn't do that beforehand. Oh, we ran out of time. I don't

1054
03:04:01,100 --> 03:04:19,180
know. I seriously might as well just like go like this action. You can fuck off. Oh, look at me.

1055
03:04:20,500 --> 03:04:24,100
Get it all out of the way before anybody has any actions. There's no battery in here.

1056
03:04:27,469 --> 03:04:33,489
Oh, can I just draw on it? What's our, what's it? Feed it into my ear. What's our actions?

1057
03:04:33,489 --> 03:04:50,049
Hold on. I can't, I used to have to go to my diaper. Hold on. What is it? Say it softly. I will,

1058
03:04:50,049 --> 03:05:15,250
I will win this if you give it to me. Give me their actions. Okay. Guys are fucked. Although I have,

1059
03:05:15,250 --> 03:05:25,840
how many do I have? I'll have eight. Okay. Um, that's solidified enough where I can,

1060
03:05:25,840 --> 03:05:31,280
no, I can, I'm not going to do that. I'm not going, okay. I, people might go, oh, come on.

1061
03:05:31,280 --> 03:05:35,680
You're not going to carve the pumpkin. I'm not going to be the guy on Twitch that has the knife

1062
03:05:35,680 --> 03:05:47,729
in his hand and is like, not going to happen. It's, I'm not doing that. Does that violate TOS?

1063
03:05:47,809 --> 03:05:57,979
Oh, I, oh yeah. Violates my life. It went right down my ass crack right now. Just went in,

1064
03:05:57,979 --> 03:06:02,540
it went all the way. It didn't, it's, it's just right now for the first time. The diaper has been

1065
03:06:02,540 --> 03:06:11,899
breached. Uh, so I'm going to draw on this. We'll spin it around. I'm serious. Just spray me with

1066
03:06:11,899 --> 03:06:17,680
the hose back. Like I was back. This is not, this is not a joke. This is actual, like spray me all

1067
03:06:17,680 --> 03:06:26,020
of my whole body with the hose. So this is, this marker is dead. We're just going to look at the

1068
03:06:26,020 --> 03:06:34,159
pumpkin. Might as well just play like funny videos. Might as well. Oh, I have new actions?

1069
03:06:35,469 --> 03:06:49,420
Okay. Chat sees them. Can the pumpkin have, we did the computer. Can we have the pumpkin actions?

1070
03:06:52,059 --> 03:07:01,500
What do I have to do here? Get off of that. We're almost at the end of the show. If you guys are

1071
03:07:01,500 --> 03:07:06,620
curious. Should I try running again? This is a treadmill. Ready? Remember that? How's my

1072
03:07:06,620 --> 03:07:21,100
nerd neck? All right. Move the knives. Ready? Don't run this way. Run this way. But then what

1073
03:07:21,100 --> 03:07:34,829
if I like, all right, this is, this looks fucking bad. I look like I'm like soaking my, oh darling,

1074
03:07:34,829 --> 03:07:46,909
please help me. All right. Not bad. I can get it one more time. That was a false ride. That was a

1075
03:07:46,909 --> 03:08:00,739
false ride. I think I got some on the camera. This is what we like to call, this boy is out of material

1076
03:08:00,739 --> 03:08:10,079
and he can't get into the pumpkin. So he's been, he's at the point where he's got nothing left

1077
03:08:10,079 --> 03:08:21,100
to do. Dropping him. No, I'm not going to drop it. This thing weighs like 200 pounds. What if I just

1078
03:08:21,100 --> 03:08:26,610
like shot foot it over at production? Drop it. I'm not going to smash this. You know, that's

1079
03:08:26,610 --> 03:08:33,709
bullshit. Just do Gallagher. This is Gallagher. You're watching Gallagher right now. Let me tell

1080
03:08:33,790 --> 03:09:00,819
you something. What? What? Funny voice. Hey, so what we do here now that a funny voice is done,

1081
03:09:02,340 --> 03:09:12,379
we just do funny voices for the rest of the stream. This is not a good diaper. It's actually

1082
03:09:12,379 --> 03:09:20,180
pretty good. And by the way, it's over the top half of, it's, it's over of my clothes. Put the

1083
03:09:20,180 --> 03:09:35,170
diaper on the pumpkin. Give me a diaper. This is like 20 in that case. Do a back flip. I might

1084
03:09:35,170 --> 03:09:41,329
need three. Should I just wear them? Should I just put these on? Okay, let's test it. Dump it. Oh,

1085
03:09:41,329 --> 03:09:47,170
he did a thing. He did something fucking weird. Into the diaper. Let's test the diaper. Dump it.

1086
03:09:47,170 --> 03:10:08,239
Let's see how good these are. You guys talked a lot of shit. Nothing got through at the bottom.

1087
03:10:08,239 --> 03:10:17,819
Look at that. Pretty good actually. This is what I'm doing right now. We're testing diapers. That

1088
03:10:17,819 --> 03:10:25,260
means I'm out of content. I just, like that image is now forever on, on camera.

1089
03:10:26,959 --> 03:10:37,420
Is dumping slime into a, into a diaper to test it. Shit. Put it on the pumpkin.

1090
03:10:37,420 --> 03:10:44,540
Okay. I'll take that. That's a bad idea. Why, why is that bad?

1091
03:10:49,600 --> 03:11:00,110
Diapers are going to protect me. This thing can hold like five gallons. That's bad advice.

1092
03:11:00,430 --> 03:11:14,989
It's kind of good advice. That's disgusting. It just, can we get the vac back here, please?

1093
03:11:15,709 --> 03:11:30,159
That was nothing in there. I don't like that sound. Can I see that for a sec? You'll see it

1094
03:11:30,159 --> 03:11:49,680
for just a sec. Up here. If you could. There you go. Thank you. Thanks a lot. It's like up my nose.

1095
03:11:54,819 --> 03:12:02,719
There's no point for this to even be here anymore. There's no reason for this pumpkin.

1096
03:12:04,079 --> 03:12:17,840
We can wash this pumpkin off. All right. I'm going to try to get into the pumpkin.

1097
03:12:17,840 --> 03:12:30,620
Very gently. I just want to get in. Carve it. What is all over this? I thought that was blood.

1098
03:12:31,340 --> 03:12:37,200
I was like, what the fuck is that? Behind you? Yeah, I know.

1099
03:12:39,020 --> 03:12:56,260
I can hear them. No, not the top rope. We're going to get like frog splashed. Okay. I just

1100
03:12:56,260 --> 03:13:02,319
got to get in. If I can get in and we can see what's in there. It's like a science experiment.

1101
03:13:05,120 --> 03:13:08,719
I'm being extraordinarily careful. The most careful I've ever been in my whole life is right

1102
03:13:08,719 --> 03:13:28,379
now. All right. I'm almost in. Okay. I'm in. Okay. I'm in. This is bait. It's not bait.

1103
03:13:32,479 --> 03:13:35,280
You know, when you do some things and you go, you know what? I probably should just like go

1104
03:13:35,280 --> 03:13:47,170
to church tomorrow. That's like, that's kind of what's in my mind at the moment. Like I don't,

1105
03:13:47,170 --> 03:13:50,930
I didn't do anything wrong, but I really just feel like I should go to church.

1106
03:13:54,340 --> 03:14:04,219
I can't get in here. This pumpkin is thick. What we got for a time? We got another five minutes.

1107
03:14:04,940 --> 03:14:14,479
You want to putt his chat? Okay. What was the words for chat?

1108
03:14:15,360 --> 03:14:44,430
Ooh, woo. Comcast. Wait, the word was streamer. Omega lull. Wow. And P. How many points did they

1109
03:14:44,430 --> 03:14:59,649
lose? 1700, which puts them way ahead of me still. P. Streamer P. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1110
03:15:01,860 --> 03:15:06,829
When we thought about this, like two or three weeks ago, it was, it was a great idea.

1111
03:15:07,469 --> 03:15:15,920
I don't know if you guys heard that, but the people at production said nobody said that.

1112
03:15:21,520 --> 03:15:28,049
Oh, but we got like, I like this. I actually like this costume. Be this for Halloween next year,

1113
03:15:29,139 --> 03:15:32,180
except don't put the diaper on. People will think you're something's wrong. You know,

1114
03:15:32,180 --> 03:15:34,899
if you have like a diaper on over your clothes, actually Doug does that.

1115
03:15:38,049 --> 03:15:41,889
All right. Uh, we, we should probably close it out here. Maybe one more round and that's it.

1116
03:15:43,170 --> 03:15:48,850
Put the rest of the actions on the screen. Yeah. Put every action at the rest of every single action

1117
03:15:48,850 --> 03:15:57,459
that's available on the screen for me right now. Okay. I am going to literally just stare into the

1118
03:15:57,459 --> 03:16:06,450
camera. What am I going to do with pumpkin? Um, I don't know, wipe it down and, and clean it and

1119
03:16:06,450 --> 03:16:17,459
give it to my mother. No, I'm not going to throw the pumpkin. Like what is going on here?

1120
03:16:18,340 --> 03:16:36,350
Oh, it's like dirt. Oh, it's actually really dirty. I wait, I, you guys have time. Okay.

1121
03:16:37,069 --> 03:16:41,489
How are you guys doing tonight? You guys having a good Halloween? Did you have a good Halloween?

1122
03:16:43,659 --> 03:16:57,709
There's new actions on screen. Okay. How many? A lot. There are more than two dozen. Okay.

1123
03:17:06,959 --> 03:17:33,469
A pose. That's not, let's try to get the whole hat orange. I feel like I'm like that first grade.

1124
03:17:33,469 --> 03:17:42,639
I'm just like, Oh, this is fun. Oh, that looks really good. What you're doing there. Oh,

1125
03:17:43,520 --> 03:17:54,399
Johnny, that's really nice. Yes, it is. Oh, wow. What is it? What'd you make up? What is it? What

1126
03:17:54,399 --> 03:18:04,670
is that a pic? What is that? What is that of? Oh, it's a face. It looks fan. It looks so good.

1127
03:18:04,670 --> 03:18:10,209
Wow. I can't wait to tell you mother about it. Thank you. Like what the fuck am I doing? I'm

1128
03:18:10,209 --> 03:18:17,010
just standing here rubbing a pumpkin. I've been rubbing a pumpkin. This is the stream content

1129
03:18:17,010 --> 03:18:26,270
you've received in the last like 30, 40 minutes is rubbing a pumpkin with oil. Is it, it's what

1130
03:18:26,350 --> 03:18:32,819
is chat's fault. That's true. You guys did come up with these actions. They're pretty good.

1131
03:18:36,079 --> 03:18:57,260
All right. So how I've only done one in like two dozen actions. Really? Okay. Wait, that actually

1132
03:18:57,260 --> 03:19:00,379
might be an action. I'm not going to, I'm going to do something. Okay. I have to decide. I have to

1133
03:19:00,379 --> 03:19:09,309
continuously move, but not do anything. This thing is heavy enough where I can hold.

1134
03:19:09,790 --> 03:19:17,309
I'm like fucking Jim Carrey from dumb and dumber. Jim Carrey with the suit on.

1135
03:19:19,569 --> 03:19:32,290
I'm not losing points for this. Am I? I should be. What about chat? Does chat have a thousand

1136
03:19:32,290 --> 03:19:40,370
things to do? It's a shitty Freddy Krueger. This is Freddy. It's Splatoon Freddy Krueger.

1137
03:19:40,930 --> 03:19:46,290
Oh, oh, oh. I would be right now. Right now. I would be, I would be gagging right now. I would

1138
03:19:46,290 --> 03:19:57,870
be going, but I'm not going to freak out. I'm going to be everyone. I'm going to use a diaper.

1139
03:19:57,870 --> 03:20:03,309
Okay. Because that was horrible. You know, when something hits you on the lip and it's something

1140
03:20:03,309 --> 03:20:08,049
that you really don't want to have in your mouth, that just happened. And I almost had that immediate

1141
03:20:08,049 --> 03:20:16,000
reaction. It was immediate, but I slowed down and I wiped it off with a diaper. So thanks for watching

1142
03:20:16,000 --> 03:20:23,760
everybody. Really appreciate everybody coming out and hanging out here. That was a lot of fun. Hey,

1143
03:20:23,760 --> 03:20:30,590
how about that? Dr. Schmikeson comes and says, hello. That was a treat. Glad to have Dr. Schmikeson

1144
03:20:30,590 --> 03:20:43,629
back. Did pretty good. Trevi was fun. We got Bugleberry. That was fun. But I like, seriously,

1145
03:20:44,190 --> 03:20:51,059
this is getting like to a point where it's too gross. So I like, do I have something I can like

1146
03:20:51,059 --> 03:20:56,799
spit into? Do I have something I can spit into? I know that sounds disgusting, but it's been like

1147
03:20:56,799 --> 03:21:02,079
in the back of my throat for like at least 20 minutes and I need to spit. Do we have anything

1148
03:21:02,079 --> 03:21:12,639
to spit? We do. Okay. Where is it? I need like a cup or a glass or something. Not on

1149
03:21:12,639 --> 03:21:23,620
the, no, no, no, no, not on the floor. There's something over here. I can spit it. Doesn't matter.

1150
03:21:30,209 --> 03:21:38,450
Oh, oh, holy. Whoa. Oh, that's, oh, what the fuck was in here?

1151
03:21:47,709 --> 03:22:01,520
What the fuck is going on? Hey, no, no, no, no, no.
