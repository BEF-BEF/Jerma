1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:07,139
Yeah, I'm addicted to Diablo 2. I know. I said last night, I'm like, I don't think I'm gonna be

2
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:13,429
doing Diablo tomorrow. Maybe just 10 hours and like, yeah, maybe we'll do something. Well,

3
00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:20,219
no, I'm addicted to Diablo 2. This is hardcore still. I talked to Joel. We've decided we're gonna

4
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:29,699
talk about tomorrow is the day for bomb defusal. Just one more, I can stop. Yeah, when it turned

5
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:33,780
out that tomorrow was gonna be the day, I was like, all right, fine. We'll just do Diablo again.

6
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:41,619
But it's been tomorrow for two weeks. Yes, it has. It's been tomorrow since January

7
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:48,340
third. It's all good. It's okay. It's probably gonna happen tomorrow. Will it? I don't know.

8
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:56,149
Something happens. Shit happens. It's okay. But since I stayed alive last night, I was thinking

9
00:00:56,149 --> 00:01:02,229
about it. Like, yeah, it's whatever. But those of you that are like, I'm not really into Diablo.

10
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:07,989
That's all right. That's okay. You don't have to be into everything we do here. But every five

11
00:01:07,989 --> 00:01:18,359
levels, I'm going to do a tier list. I have 14 of them. Tier lists we have not done. So every

12
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:25,129
probably every like 30 or every like 30 minutes or so, there's gonna be another tier list. All

13
00:01:25,129 --> 00:01:34,200
right. Well, then looks like I'm gonna have to watch if you're gonna do tier lists. We're going

14
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,640
full on double variety stream today. Every stream is a variety stream here.

15
00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:51,290
Do one to start things off. All right, I could I could we could start one off with an easy one.

16
00:01:51,290 --> 00:02:03,500
We're targeting all audiences with this one here. I hate variety. But yeah, the plan is tomorrow to

17
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:09,159
do keep talking and nobody explodes. That'd be funny if we've been doing this for this long and

18
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:13,860
saying, Hey, we'll do it again. We'll do it again. And we just play a different game. We just do a

19
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:26,629
different co-op game tomorrow. Am I going to play Temtem? I don't think so. I don't think I'm

20
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:43,030
gonna play Temtem. Oh, Freddy. Freddy. Freddy Dread. Yeah, it didn't even show up on the screen

21
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:48,870
because I'm on my intro screen. But that was $200 from Freddy. 20,000 bits from Freddy Dread.

22
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:59,050
Welcome back again, Freddy. Thanks for your insane contributions. And yes, this is Freddy Dread. Yes,

23
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:08,469
this is this is the real Freddy Dread. Some of you guys like it. No. Oh, yes, it is a real one.

24
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:19,689
They say, German, I'm in Vegas for my first time in five days. Oh, hey, dude, I've been in Vegas for

25
00:03:19,689 --> 00:03:24,409
the first time since last week. I'm in Vegas for the first time for five days. Please suggest

26
00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:34,659
something I should do or see. Well, do I've got something for you to do. I have a very, very

27
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:42,340
special place that you should go to. It is a restaurant. It is... Finish the sentence, guys.

28
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:55,189
It's in the... Where is it? You guys all know. Where is it? It's in the... Do you guys not know?

29
00:03:56,389 --> 00:04:01,830
No, it's not in the link. Thank you. It's in the link. It's a restaurant. It's my favorite restaurant

30
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:09,900
in Vegas. It is Hash House at GoGo. Go to the one in the link. Oh, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

31
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:17,980
whoa, whoa. Not the link in the description, the link on the strip. And if you like blue cheese,

32
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:23,579
get the blue cheese burger. It's right up there on their favorites on the menu. It's a huge burger,

33
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:29,980
double patty, thin, delicious, juicy patties. You've got to go to Hash House at GoGo and tell

34
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:36,060
them German985 sent you. The four of you that have done that so far. And when you say that,

35
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,660
they're not going to know who the fuck I am or what you're talking about. They're just going

36
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:50,680
to think you're a strange person and you're going to get charged extra. No, but for real,

37
00:04:50,680 --> 00:05:00,470
Freddie, thanks for the... What are you doing in Vegas? What are you doing in Vegas? The German

38
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:24,389
fan tax. He's in Vegas doing his best. They will be like that guy who was eating tuna from a can

39
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:35,060
with his bare hands. Probably performing. That's pretty sick. You're here for five days? I might

40
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:44,579
have to... I tried to read it. Any news on keep talking? Yep. Tomorrow. It's always tomorrow.

41
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:52,629
It's always tomorrow until it doesn't happen, right? But that's a shitload of money to start

42
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:57,819
the stream off. Thanks a lot, Freddie. Have fun in Vegas. Besides eating, oh my God, I did another...

43
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:04,660
I knocked the same battery over on my desk every time. I have this exact same pattern where I go

44
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:12,339
like this with my hands. When I talk... So when I talk... You guys can't even see this. Nevermind.

45
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:24,089
Actually, yeah, you can. So when I talk, I use my hands. If you're standing in a vicinity around me,

46
00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:29,610
just watch out because I go fucking all over the place. I'm like, let me tell you this.

47
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:37,209
The thing is... And people just think I'm nuts. But anyways, I do the same motion. I go out and

48
00:06:37,209 --> 00:06:43,850
I go to the left. So I go to talk that way and then bang into the left. I do that forward and

49
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:50,360
left and I knock down stuff on my desk all the time. And you can do... Your hair looks weird today.

50
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:56,550
You know, I told myself that I was going to stop reading out one negative comment that I see in

51
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:05,189
my chat rooms. I'm supposed to be doing that anymore. Anyways, yeah, I talk with my hands a

52
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:10,709
lot. So just... Now I'm realizing why people stand so far away from me when I'm talking.

53
00:07:11,829 --> 00:07:14,870
I'm just figuring this out. No, this is... When I talk to somebody, they usually

54
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:18,790
like at least seven feet away from me and they keep going like this. What does this mean?

55
00:07:19,829 --> 00:07:46,220
What's that mean? Why are they doing that? Because you're a spit talker. Yeah, no, I'm not.

56
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:50,139
Anyways, so we're going to start... You want to do a tier list first?

57
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:58,410
Is that what you guys want to do? Is that the plan? We start off with a tier list? All right,

58
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:06,629
we'll get one out of the way. All right, the first one I'm going to do is... Let me move this over

59
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:15,209
here. First tier list is a lot here. All right, we're going to do... We'll do pet reptiles for

60
00:08:15,209 --> 00:08:25,740
the first one. That sounds pretty good. Pet reptiles. I'm going to be a little smaller

61
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:38,820
so you can see all the reptiles. Okay, pet reptiles. Tier lists. Well, can I even do... Can

62
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:43,139
I do this tier list if I've never had a pet reptile before? It comes in my eye. Can you see it? What

63
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:52,629
is it? In this eye right here. It's wicked blurry. What's in it? That was weird. All my vision was

64
00:08:52,629 --> 00:08:57,750
just blocked by like a floating thing. All right, a pimple in your eye. No. All right, can I do a

65
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:05,210
reptile tier list if I've never had a reptile before? Can I do this? Well, how about this is

66
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:13,370
just like what I would want as a reptile owner? No, I can't. No, no. So hold on. If I've never...

67
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:19,220
That doesn't make any sense. No, I'm doing it. I don't care. All right, turtles. For pets or...

68
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:26,389
I'm going to use this as like what I think is coolest or what I'd want. Unfortunately,

69
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:35,340
turtles are cool, but I don't know if I'd really want one. What is this thing? I don't know what

70
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:54,470
that is. These are all snakes. Where's the huge dragon? There we go. But that's a... Okay,

71
00:09:55,110 --> 00:10:03,340
wait, that's a giant tortoise. That's kind of cool actually. I don't want a snake. They're cool,

72
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:08,100
but I don't want one. Bearded dragon? That's what I want. I want a bearded dragon probably the most

73
00:10:08,659 --> 00:10:21,450
or a huge lizard that eats its own room. Yeah, I know the names. I've watched the reptile guy

74
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:27,539
and I know what these are. They're like the best geckos. Crested skull geckos. What are they called?

75
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:32,220
Crested geckos? Crested geckos? I knew. See, I knew it. I knew what I was talking about.

76
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:43,909
These are supposed to be the best geckos. Is this a chameleon? Chameleons seem kind of fragile to

77
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:48,070
me. I don't think I'd want one as a pet. They're really interesting animals, but they feel fragile.

78
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:51,190
I feel like I would hurt it or something. You know what I mean? Like they just have these little

79
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:57,830
arms and I feel I wouldn't want to handle... I would want to just have them to enjoy viewing.

80
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,779
They're pretty fragile. Yeah, I just don't... I wouldn't want to potentially do any harm.

81
00:11:04,419 --> 00:11:16,940
Um, we got a snake. What's with the turtles? There's too many turtles and too many snakes

82
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:25,700
on this list. What is that? This is skateboard. That's not even... That's not... That shouldn't

83
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:37,879
be on the list. I don't know what this is either. This is a leopard gecko. Those are pretty cool.

84
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:55,929
I like them. All right, let me refine this. Big tortoise is cool, but I feel like they take big

85
00:11:55,929 --> 00:12:00,710
dumps. I don't know if that would want one. Oh, this thing takes big dumps too.

86
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:25,240
Okay, that's all right. Would I rather have a snake or a turtle? Where's the ball python? Right

87
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:31,610
here, right? This is a ball python, isn't it? Or is it this? Ball python? No, which one's a ball

88
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:41,750
python? This brown one here? I mean, I really don't... I don't know. Is this an iguana or

89
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:49,350
something? I don't know what these are. Turtles are a pain to take care of. I've never had one.

90
00:12:49,909 --> 00:12:54,940
I don't know what these are though. I feel like if I don't know what it is, it shouldn't be this

91
00:12:54,940 --> 00:13:06,090
high up on a list. I'd probably... But no, but if you have a snake, you have to feed a snake

92
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:21,139
mice, don't you? Remember, what's with the title and category? What? This is Diablo 2. We're playing

93
00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:29,129
Diablo 2. Diablo 2 looking... Yeah, this is just starting the stream. Diablo 2. See, look at the

94
00:13:29,129 --> 00:13:39,299
background. It's coming up. All right, I think this is accurate. What's with the quality of the start

95
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:57,940
of this stream? You mean high quality? That's what they meant. Cool. Big ass cup here. Look at

96
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:10,649
this thing. Isn't this too big? There's like 16 ounces of liquid in here. Why do they make them

97
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:20,330
like this? It's such a thick outside and they make it huge. All right, sick. That's a normal size cup.

98
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:35,740
Yeah, I think this is accurate. Why did you buy it? Because it fucking looked neat to me. I didn't

99
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:52,200
buy it. I'm drinking out of Kim's cup today. You're a thief. Yeah. All right. All right,

100
00:14:52,200 --> 00:15:00,440
that's it. Bearded dragon. I want a big tegu, is that called? Or I don't... Tegu's the best

101
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:06,809
big monitor style lizards, right? Yeah, crested gecko. This is an accurate list.

102
00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:14,679
He's awesome and I don't want a skateboard. Cool. Hey, you know what time it is now? Diablo 2.

103
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:41,179
Let's go. Dude, how the fuck are you guys? Welcome to Act 3. Where are the bone friends? By the way,

104
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:50,100
take a look at this. I did some work. I've been working. I made this much easier for you guys.

105
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:56,179
If you take a look at what happens, take a look at this shit. Ready? Bingo. Now look at not only

106
00:15:56,179 --> 00:16:01,460
do we have accurate stats and everything, you can see how many points are in it and you don't have

107
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:06,580
to pick the category. You can just click on the one you want. For instance, like here we are

108
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:12,309
banging. Now there's two. I can take that away. Look at that. We don't have to spend so much time

109
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:24,330
doing this anymore and check it. We come right back here. Bingo. Done. What the hell does that

110
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:35,259
even mean? I missed. Oh, you missed the last stream. Oh yeah. Okay. So how this works? No,

111
00:16:35,259 --> 00:16:43,289
everyone knows. Let's get our spaghetti. Um, eat some monster here. What was the last thing I did?

112
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:47,690
Didn't want to kill on Dario again. I'm so addicted to this. I wanted to play it so bad after

113
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:52,840
streaming that I went to bed immediately because I knew I wanted to wake up early to play it again.

114
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:56,330
Where are the skeletons? Well, I have to kill something to get a skeleton. We need to win

115
00:16:56,330 --> 00:17:04,940
admission first. They don't know. All right. How does it work? Let me explain. So, uh, you level

116
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:10,170
up in this game with an experience bar. What do you fucking do? Okay. So you level up with an

117
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:15,750
experience bar. When we level up, we're going to get five stat points to put into these. And

118
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:23,670
I have 50 strength as a necromancer, which is, it's a little odd this early. 75 vitality. The

119
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:28,759
chat has been picking these. These are skill points, right? So the images that you're seeing

120
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:35,579
here are all laid out across here. Before yesterday, we were picking categories first,

121
00:17:35,579 --> 00:17:39,539
and that was sort of a pain in the ass. So I figured just dump the whole thing out,

122
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:44,069
stop blaming chat. And this is what chat has selected so far. Uh, they, they really like

123
00:17:44,069 --> 00:17:50,759
skeleton friends, but they don't like giving me any offensive abilities. So I'm forced,

124
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:57,480
unfortunately, to walk around with an axe and swing at it with a bunch of strength.

125
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:02,359
So, and not only that, they've been incredibly indecisive at what they want to do here

126
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:07,480
because look, we have points in skeleton, we have points in skeletal mage, skeleton mastery,

127
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:13,099
but also we're going multiple points down here into golems and golem mastery. They're not really

128
00:18:13,099 --> 00:18:22,900
sure what they want to do. He's mad about this. No, I think it's fun. What are the skeleton's names?

129
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:41,259
Okay. So there's seven. So it's Laffy, Daffy, Sleepy, Snoozy, um, Grumpy, Hungry, and Ed,

130
00:18:41,259 --> 00:19:01,819
whatever they are. Got Donkey? That's Shrek. All right. Well, let's get some skeletons.

131
00:19:01,819 --> 00:19:12,009
Hungry? Really? What's wrong with Hungry? You missed the dark wanderer. No, I didn't. I knew

132
00:19:12,009 --> 00:19:17,859
he turns into the slugs. All right. We didn't even get that. No, no, we got to talk to, um,

133
00:19:17,859 --> 00:19:25,099
no, we don't. You act free sucks. Let's just be real. How long is the stream going to be today?

134
00:19:25,099 --> 00:19:36,940
As long as until I'm satisfied. So he's very long. Yesterday. I was not satisfied for a long

135
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:51,000
time. Here we go. Here's our friends. Oh yeah. So actually it's 10 people both fight in Dariel

136
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,319
till you get a unique, but I got to make some progress first because act three really is such

137
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:58,839
a pain in the ass. And then we get to do act four, which is the best act in the game.

138
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:10,039
You started catching your streams live playing Minecraft. It's the dream. Well, welcome.

139
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:18,180
Oh, don't you have to find the weapon? Yeah, you got, I got to find a weapon out here.

140
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:28,200
The random event. How many players? Uh, five setting the players to five. You can say I'm

141
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:32,680
in single player because it doesn't have one yesterday. I got my account up and, um, I don't

142
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:39,160
know why it did. So, uh, I have a band fucking battle net account and I have to play in single

143
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,119
player. This is hardcore. If I die, it's over and I can't get this character back.

144
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:51,880
Uh, but when I do players, I can set the game to be harder. So the game thinks there's five

145
00:20:51,880 --> 00:21:07,529
people in the game right now. So everything's hard. I think I already found it. Oh, how would I?

146
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:13,930
Oh yes. And by the way, every, uh, every 30 or 40 minutes, we're going to do another tier list.

147
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:30,680
We're doing a double here. What did I say? Every, every like, every like five levels,

148
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:41,960
there's so much poison in acts two and three. Yeah, there is. He's going to forget. No, what

149
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:49,750
the stream has been live for 20 minutes. So at minute number, let's see. So when did I,

150
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:59,130
what 10 minutes ago did I start? When did I run out here? All right. We need to find the spider.

151
00:22:00,329 --> 00:22:05,049
The thing about act three is you have to find member of the cube and the staff and all that

152
00:22:05,049 --> 00:22:10,650
bullshit in act two. Well, they decided that they wanted to do that, but make it add like three more

153
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:17,190
items to find. So we have to find the heart, the brain, the guts, the blood that we've got to find

154
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:23,559
so much shit and make this giant flail, which then lets us go to Mephisto's lair. We never played

155
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:40,809
this before and there's nothing over here. That's a spoiler. That's okay. Imagine explaining that all

156
00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:46,890
to a boomer. Well, if you were, if you're a boomer, you may have played this game already.

157
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:54,730
Something that a boomer might know more than you guys right now is the necromancer skill tree.

158
00:22:54,730 --> 00:23:10,180
All right. We can, we're not going over there. Oh fuck. I forgot about this. Damn it. It upgrades

159
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:18,519
the gem that's in your inventory. God damn it. I've ruined it. That gem shrine. If you bring any gem,

160
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:22,119
it upgrades it immediately. If it's in your inventory to the next higher quality,

161
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:27,849
I could have just made like a flawless. I'm just going to, I think I've probably restarted the whole

162
00:23:27,849 --> 00:23:36,839
thing. Yeah. I'll restart from scratch. All right. Well, where do I, where the hell am I going?

163
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:46,950
Looking for the spider cavern. Ooh. Oh, that wasn't even a good one. You're saved scumming.

164
00:23:50,009 --> 00:23:59,849
I'm not saved scumming. That was a stunted room. Here we go. There's a well up here. Thank God.

165
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:13,539
Ah, that's some good sight here. Make the top corner of all different face cams of you.

166
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:19,859
If people wanted me to do that yesterday, but that's, I feel like that's going to get old real

167
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:55,819
quick. That's, you know, that's going to get old very quickly. Do it. All right. Um, it's going to

168
00:24:55,819 --> 00:25:24,789
take a long time. I got to go in a place that's safe. Okay. There we go. I'm safe here, right?

169
00:25:25,589 --> 00:25:58,569
This is going to fucking break my computer and I'm going to delay them too. So when I move around,

170
00:25:59,529 --> 00:26:28,410
this actually might fuck up the computer though. That's not, why is that not working?

171
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:40,660
No, I can't. It can only be one source. It can only be one source. It can't happen.

172
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:46,019
Just, I, I get, I'm going to have to like invert the colors and move them around. I can't delay them.

173
00:26:46,019 --> 00:26:51,450
It has to be different cameras because these are, these are technically a copy

174
00:26:52,410 --> 00:27:07,269
because now it's going to do it all of them. Yeah. Watch this. Ready? I can't. It's still connected.

175
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:25,109
Sorry guys. We tried. I need like six cameras. Worth a shot. Yeah. I can't do them individually.

176
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:49,640
Go get, go get six cameras. What did I do? I just became the green goblin.

177
00:27:50,519 --> 00:28:19,980
Which one of these is real? All right. Get rid of this one. I'm still alive, right? No,

178
00:28:20,059 --> 00:28:34,250
no, I'm playing Diablo 2 now. That's weird. You look sick. I look like I'm about to puke.

179
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:57,339
Cartoon. Hold on. Oh, wait. Hold on. Wait. We need that music.

180
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,700
Wait, wait, wait. We need, hold on. We need that music to play.

181
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:25,670
Someone that's like, what was it called? No, no, no. It's longer than this. Isn't it?

182
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:39,660
Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. How old is this?

183
00:29:40,539 --> 00:29:43,720
It's a little, two days maybe.

184
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:25,380
Can I play Diablo 2 now, please? I don't, I, I don't know what to tell you. I don't understand.

185
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:32,099
I don't, okay. I'm playing the game now. I'm going to play the game. That was not, not even close.

186
00:30:32,099 --> 00:30:43,619
Wait, I want to see that. Show it to me. Show it to me. I need to see what I, I need to see what

187
00:30:43,619 --> 00:31:08,170
I've done. I need to see that. Please show me. Please. Don't show them. Show me. It wasn't that

188
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:14,299
bad. It was, it was kind of humorous. No one clipped it because no one thought it was funny.

189
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:19,210
Oh, really? Nobody thought it was funny?

190
00:31:26,069 --> 00:31:58,490
If I die right now in hardcore, if I can trap somewhere. God damn it. All right, here we go.

191
00:31:59,289 --> 00:32:08,940
A necromancer. What am I looking for? Stony field or something? I think my girlfriend's cheating on

192
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:15,740
her husband. What do I do? Um, I don't think it's going to, I don't think it's going to work out.

193
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:30,789
Um, why did I read that? Because it was the first thing that my brain looked at.

194
00:32:31,589 --> 00:32:40,500
All right, come on. We need spider caverns. Watch it. Watch it. Watch it.

195
00:32:41,779 --> 00:33:01,720
Why are we all spread out? Everyone join together. Wait, I need the, uh, the permanent stat point.

196
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:16,259
Do another joke, E-clown. How about you sit down? You've been standing this whole time.

197
00:33:24,579 --> 00:33:29,059
You were waiting for an opportunity to point and scream during a lull in the, uh, in the,

198
00:33:29,059 --> 00:33:29,940
in the performance here.

199
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:48,859
You bring a potion to this guy and he gives you stat increases. Stop reading chat messages. A

200
00:33:48,859 --> 00:34:18,119
red spy is in the base. What? I had to breathe halfway through that because I went right into

201
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:24,199
it. So that's why it stopped when it went that fast. I had to breathe. All right, get in here.

202
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:32,460
Let's go. Big fight. Big fight. Can't just drop a track like that without warning.

203
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:40,789
I was about to turn the fucking cam on. He puked green and played sound again.

204
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:48,780
After every fucking bad thing that happens, I'm going to do that.

205
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:54,119
And I'm going to see how long it takes for a thousand people to leave. Found it.

206
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,360
If more people leave from Bugleberry than they do from that,

207
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:08,260
then Bugleberry really might need to retire as a hero.

208
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:20,539
Oh shit, need mages. I'm kidding. Why would I ever retire Bugleberry? The best character ever.

209
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:31,820
Is there a unique here? All right, we're looking for the eyes or the brain? What's in the cavern?

210
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:43,480
I forgot to look at all these potions. This is a joke.

211
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,170
13 to life. They're getting rid of these.

212
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:05,800
Still keep that. That's good. Add. Add. Sell. Sell. Sell. Sell. Sell. Sell. Sell. Sell. Only big

213
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:21,800
potions. Uh, I wish I had a bigger belt. What keys do I have? Get rid of that. Get rid of, uh,

214
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:27,719
all right. Put these here. I'm sorry for backups. Get rid of that. Okay. Oh, I got six. One.

215
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:32,619
He's still... Why is he playing a normie build?

216
00:36:37,059 --> 00:36:45,500
Is the title of my stream working? Is the title of the stream working? Hello? Hello? Is the title

217
00:36:45,500 --> 00:37:03,000
working? I didn't pick any of this. Why did he pick a normie build? Hello? Are you calling Bugleberry

218
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:14,139
a bad character? No. Now he's mad. No, he's not. He's fucking glad. Bugleberry emote? Yeah, and

219
00:37:14,139 --> 00:37:19,980
it's going to be 12 slots. I'm going to ruin my chat. All right, let's go get that side.

220
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:28,219
And it's going to be a screen cap of when he goes...

221
00:37:29,989 --> 00:37:52,539
Oh! It's going to be like Bugleberry 01 through 12. Oh, he's got something there. H22. Yep.

222
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:14,710
Yeah. All right. How many slots do I have? Well, there goes... There's your April Fool's joke,

223
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:31,880
guys. It's going to be like 35 slots or like 38 slots. Oh, I don't know about that. I'm going to

224
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:41,510
have to get rid of it immediately though, because that would be a disaster because people would be

225
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:46,630
doing that and other people's streams and shit. And nobody wants like a 50 slot emote destroying

226
00:38:46,630 --> 00:39:03,500
their whole chat room. I'm not going to... I don't want to be responsible for that one. Unleash the

227
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:11,099
plague. No. It's so bad. Hey, you want to know the quickest way to make a bunch of people hate

228
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:20,659
your guts? Ruin their stream with a 50 slot emote that people spam. What's this guy with

229
00:39:20,659 --> 00:39:30,219
the mask on in the chat? What's this? Can we fucking take care of that? That's it. And now do

230
00:39:30,219 --> 00:39:43,460
that across 5,000 channels. What the fuck is that? Jerma? Fucking stupid, man. That's it. That's it.

231
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:51,239
It's not going to be like, oh, that was funny. Fucking Jerma. Who the fuck's that?

232
00:39:52,630 --> 00:40:10,630
Fucking dick. Holy shit. That was a big chest. Flawed diamond. Always pick up the diamonds.

233
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:23,019
Anything else? And then that person then goes into their Discord and gets in a group with a

234
00:40:23,019 --> 00:40:28,969
couple of friends, other streamers or something. You guys see this like Jerma, bugleberry emote

235
00:40:28,969 --> 00:40:35,210
thing? Yeah. Yeah. Who's this fucking guy? I think he is. That's funny, dude. You could like

236
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:41,059
take over a whole channel with that. That's funny. Imagine the fucking, imagine the fucking

237
00:40:41,059 --> 00:40:55,349
what kind of person you got to be to do that. That's so funny, dude. Yeah. And I got it. And

238
00:40:55,349 --> 00:41:00,469
by the way, that happened. No, no, no. Seriously, that's such fucking bullshit. I just got an ace

239
00:41:00,469 --> 00:41:05,510
in CSGO when it happened too. And that's in the dead people where I just ruined everything.

240
00:41:07,909 --> 00:41:11,989
I had to turn away from the computer, take the middle of it and ban a bunch of people and shit,

241
00:41:11,989 --> 00:41:23,269
man. Who should fucking do something about that? I can't believe I still haven't found this thing.

242
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:37,590
Why do all the streamers sound like the E3 actual gameplay fake voice chat?

243
00:41:47,420 --> 00:42:05,320
I don't know. That's pretty good. Come on, give me some, give me some unique.

244
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:23,820
F-rude. Are we missing anybody? I'm, I'm, I don't even, I'm missing like six people. I wish I had a

245
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:31,099
move instead of just D. This is guys. If you come to a Diablo two stream and you see the arrow

246
00:42:31,099 --> 00:42:42,900
pointing down here on the left mouse click some, Hey dude, somebody help this guy. Omega low. Look

247
00:42:42,900 --> 00:43:00,329
omega low, omega low. What is it? Halo and the Nancy Drew game were among the most popular

248
00:43:00,409 --> 00:43:20,469
Steam games in December. No way. There's no way. No fucking way. What? I can't believe it. How?

249
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:43,800
Do we have a source on this? Hold on a second. This is PC gamer. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

250
00:43:44,599 --> 00:44:06,820
Okay. Hold on. I have to read this. I don't fucking believe this. I really don't. No, wrong thing.

251
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:36,010
Where is it? Why can I capture this? Horn tabs. Yeah. No. Okay. Here we go.

252
00:44:41,590 --> 00:45:06,099
Halo. I can't fucking believe this. This is going to be fucked up for a second. We need to read this.

253
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:22,699
Okay. This has to be a joke. No, it's not. Red Dead. Okay. Valve has posted a list of the most

254
00:45:22,699 --> 00:45:27,179
successful Steam releases in December. And as usual, it's a mix of the expected. Halo,

255
00:45:27,179 --> 00:45:34,489
Red Dead Redemption 2 and surprising Nancy Drew Midnight in Salem. VR Paradise Gentleman's Club.

256
00:45:34,489 --> 00:45:38,489
The list isn't ordered. So we don't know which among these sold best, but it's testament to

257
00:45:38,489 --> 00:45:44,300
the wide range of games available on the platform. The list is determined by the amount of revenue

258
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:57,210
generated during the first fortnight of each game's launch. No, no, this is not this. This

259
00:45:57,210 --> 00:46:14,280
is not us. This is a popular franchise. This has nothing to do with us. Even the screenshot though

260
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:25,030
is no, there's no way. It's probably just really popular. I don't, I have no fucking idea, man.

261
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:44,760
Don't ask me. All right. Anyways, weird shit today. Huh? Weird shit today.

262
00:46:45,639 --> 00:46:55,980
I guess I'm real weird shit going on. Nobody else even streams that game, but don't people

263
00:46:55,980 --> 00:47:07,019
buy that game? Is the Drew crew really that large? It can't be. I talked a lot of shit too. I said

264
00:47:07,019 --> 00:47:12,300
there wasn't enough people on the Drew crew to even make a whole baseball team and it was the

265
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:20,420
second most revenue generating game on steam. Uh, reverse it. They're the ones in the stadium.

266
00:47:25,239 --> 00:47:37,050
They weren't ordered. So you're telling me that VR Gentleman's Club could be more popular. Is this

267
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:42,969
even the right place to get the item? It's not. No, it's not. I'm not, I'm in the wrong place.

268
00:47:43,769 --> 00:47:56,440
Yeah, I'm in the wrong place. It's the spider cavern, not the arachnid lair.

269
00:47:58,150 --> 00:48:04,659
Jeremy, how many copies did I buy? I mean, I bought like 20 Nancy Drew games or something.

270
00:48:05,539 --> 00:48:23,769
It's guaranteed top 20. Spider cavern, spider cavern. Oh, here's the waypoint. Literally just

271
00:48:23,769 --> 00:48:37,739
you. You made it make millions of dollars. That would be something, wouldn't it? Not in the right

272
00:48:37,739 --> 00:48:53,579
place. Apologize. What's this link? Nancy Drew midnight in Salem. All time peak 800.

273
00:48:54,460 --> 00:49:07,909
How much is, how much is midnight in Salem? How much is midnight in Salem?

274
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:34,760
$20 was 800 times 20, about $1,600. That's not 1600. It's like, it's like 20 grand.

275
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:39,289
A lot of y'all getting that wrong.

276
00:49:42,010 --> 00:49:47,369
And people, what people make fun of my math. A lot of y'all getting that wrong.

277
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:53,590
That's my favorite comment in the chat. All right, so let's just assume that 800 people bought it.

278
00:49:54,309 --> 00:50:01,860
There's no way 800 of you guys bought that game during that, during those streams. No way.

279
00:50:03,539 --> 00:50:15,110
I would assume maybe like six of you. Not a thousand. We all bought it. Teenagers play

280
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:34,900
video games too. That's what I'm saying. I think this is just a weird coincidence.

281
00:50:35,619 --> 00:50:39,219
I don't think this means anything. It's very odd, but I don't think it means anything.

282
00:50:39,219 --> 00:51:02,710
All right. Well, the next time I get approached by a brand and they say, Hey, Mr. Albertson,

283
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:06,309
we just want to know we're just so we can be confident that you could potentially help us

284
00:51:06,309 --> 00:51:12,780
out with talking about our product. Do you have any, any kind of experience? And I'll just link

285
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:20,420
them this article and go fucking Nancy Drew was top 20 on steam. Nancy Drew was, and they'll go,

286
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:52,460
Holy shit. If this guy can sell Nancy Drew, he can sell any. You're a Scientologist.

287
00:51:54,099 --> 00:52:11,929
What the hell are you talking about? Look at how big this forest is. Missing a mage. We need to

288
00:52:11,929 --> 00:52:26,389
have a full stack of friends. Otherwise it's not worth it. Ring sucks. Charm. I'm sorry. Now it's

289
00:52:26,389 --> 00:52:33,019
stuck. Somebody, uh, no, I'm not, I'm not going to influence chat. Somebody, somebody said,

290
00:52:33,179 --> 00:52:37,099
we're doing this all wrong and I'm not going to influence chat, but we're doing it all wrong.

291
00:52:37,099 --> 00:52:42,219
Just want to make sure everyone's aware of that. All wrong. All of it. Wrong. All wrong.

292
00:52:46,070 --> 00:53:03,849
Now what? Nancy Drew is now the most played game in history of steam. And it's all

293
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:13,139
thanks to this wacky streamer. Yeah. I, I, you can, I can inspect and edit too.

294
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:29,639
Now this is all messed up. What happened to my skill tree? The Drew crew strikes again.

295
00:53:30,519 --> 00:53:37,510
We go. Now I can see what the hell I'm doing. All right, let's go. He hates the joke. He can

296
00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:55,900
inspect. He can edit. I'll get back to town as that only works on your parents. You know, you,

297
00:53:55,900 --> 00:54:03,480
you could, you could edit a page that says that you were nominated for best actor in a supporting

298
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:08,840
role and send it to your mom. And she'd be like, what's going, what's going on? What? I didn't know

299
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:15,829
you, you were an, wait, what? You're an actor. Who did this? I know because I did it one time.

300
00:54:18,329 --> 00:54:31,400
She was like, what the heck? I'm just kidding. And then she got real sad. She was like, oh,

301
00:54:32,679 --> 00:54:56,519
you asshole. Not doing it. Everyone has expected it. Didn't do it. Didn't do it.

302
00:54:56,519 --> 00:55:03,880
Now everyone's pissed because I didn't do it. All right. Oh, what's this rune?

303
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:10,599
Do I already have one? No, I can, I can select every single rune, even Zed or Zod.

304
00:55:11,159 --> 00:55:18,579
The hardest rune to find in the game. Zod. That shit used to go for like 30 SOJ. It was the most

305
00:55:18,579 --> 00:55:26,380
expensive thing in the whole game. It was insane. It was impossible to find. It was part of so many

306
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:34,889
rune words. Some of the best rune words in the whole game were because of Zod. What was, what

307
00:55:34,889 --> 00:55:55,460
was Enigma? What was the actual rune word? Listen to this nerd. Oh, that brings back memories.

308
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:11,460
Almost a level up. How many people did you scam? With Zod? I didn't. I never had a Zod. Some runes

309
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:21,690
you can't get outside a ladder. That's right. It's not fair. I can't get them. How's that fair?

310
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:26,090
You, you, you reserve some of the coolest stuff in the game for like the best players and the ones

311
00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:41,320
that come on. It's not fair. Blizzard doesn't care. Why isn't the Harajuku in the inventory?

312
00:56:42,219 --> 00:56:45,820
Because I don't, I don't like it. I don't like it being in my inventory because I like it to

313
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:53,610
be a clean inventory. I like having structure. I know. Yes, there's been 20 potions. That's

314
00:56:53,610 --> 00:57:00,630
because my belt sucks and I need a better belt. Just stay tuned. It's about to get way cooler,

315
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:05,320
but it's a cube. I know. Uh, what do I, what do I want to do? I want to gamble. All right. What

316
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:10,809
do I have? What's the worst thing I have? Boots. I need better boots. It's boots or ring. Should

317
00:57:10,809 --> 00:57:23,059
I buy a ring? I'm going for it. I'm going all in. I'm just going to buy a ring. Here we go.

318
00:57:23,059 --> 00:57:27,380
Level one telekinesis. Too bad. That's not teleport. I thought it was teleport and I almost

319
00:57:27,380 --> 00:58:05,050
shit my pants. Get a belt. My belt's okay. I need boots. Well, I'm out of money. So we just said

320
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:10,329
your belt was shit. Well, I mean, we're holding stuff. There's only two slots. You can have up

321
00:58:10,329 --> 00:58:26,550
to, I believe five slots in some of the big belts, big heavy belts. I didn't do that though. So that's

322
00:58:26,550 --> 00:58:41,900
false. You know what that means? It's time for some chat interaction.

323
00:58:55,219 --> 00:59:06,789
Chat fix everything. Plate mail. Let me stop this blunt junk. We're about to go into the

324
00:59:06,789 --> 00:59:19,400
marsh I think. Still in the forest. Somehow. Somehow we're still in the forest. I don't know how.

325
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:35,659
Player jungle. Yeah, I gotta go back. Unless if the waypoint's right here, that's good.

326
00:59:42,519 --> 00:59:45,000
This is probably as close to a pacifist run as you can get in this game.

327
00:59:49,239 --> 01:00:04,150
Second unique in the game. And it's probably going to go right to Vic. Yeah, unique, unique,

328
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:08,789
unique. I used to do this thing where I would, I'm kind of a psycho about this,

329
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:15,030
but I would hold on to uniques as long as I could and then do just a mass unveiling of what it was.

330
01:00:15,670 --> 01:00:21,190
This is back when I didn't really know the game very well. It was so much fun. Especially with

331
01:00:21,190 --> 01:00:24,710
rings. If you got like four or five rings and you're like, all right, which ring is it? Because the

332
01:00:24,710 --> 01:00:41,420
ring could be, it's only, you know, there's so much variety. Let's go. Oh, that's, that's,

333
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:51,929
ah, it's good though. 10 strength, 35% chance to open wound. 10% HP per hit. This is going to

334
01:00:51,929 --> 01:01:12,599
the Vic. 10% health stone per hit. He's never going to die. This guy's never going to die.

335
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:22,070
That's 10% HP. Kyle would have used it. Kyle can't even equip it. So no, he wouldn't have.

336
01:01:27,159 --> 01:01:42,969
Got to fight the monster here. Champion rat man. Oh, I must just fucking, I thought it was another

337
01:01:42,969 --> 01:01:57,219
one. We got the, uh, the good bin though. This is a quest at a lack. I get this shit out of here.

338
01:01:57,219 --> 01:02:08,760
I have so much crap. My inventory is loaded with free up. Um, I can get them later. Put them down.

339
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:23,829
How big is this? Actually kind of normal attack. That's kind of good.

340
01:02:30,119 --> 01:02:37,829
Come back for it. All right. Uh, return to the good bin to Ormus.

341
01:02:45,219 --> 01:02:50,780
Ormus congratulates you. Old spirits of Skatsim will watch over you for returning.

342
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:59,420
Bro, why do you, you have a big what? Ormus will now once again use his powers to protect the

343
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:15,050
innocent from the shadow. Yes. Tearless now? Nope. This magic ring does me no good. Here, wear it

344
01:03:15,050 --> 01:03:23,659
proudly. Okay. What is it? Well, thank you Ormus. That's not bad. Oh, but a hunter to

345
01:03:23,659 --> 01:03:30,969
attack rating. Holy shit. That's really good actually. Hold resist, poison resist, dexterity.

346
01:03:31,530 --> 01:03:33,690
Oh, we're going to get rid of, what are we getting? Yeah. Let's get rid of this.

347
01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:49,300
333. That's a good number. That's a weird 33% number. All right. Let's, uh, let's, let's try out

348
01:03:49,300 --> 01:04:03,900
our new technique to get the skills. Huh? What do you say? 16 to 37. Yeah. It's time to get rid of

349
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:13,079
this. How much strength do I need? Don't I have that? Wait. Oh, it's 54 strength. Why do I care

350
01:04:13,079 --> 01:04:20,179
about strength? I don't, I don't want you to do 54 strength, whatever. All right. Uh, so first of all,

351
01:04:20,179 --> 01:04:34,170
when you do this, you could do me a favor and, um, click on a stat that you want. If you click

352
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:37,530
on the screen, if you, if you have extensions enabled, you can click on the screen. If you

353
01:04:38,329 --> 01:04:46,340
so inclined, which stat do I want to do? Did derma stay up all night? Yeah, dude. Yep.

354
01:04:46,340 --> 01:05:12,199
How come I can't see it? That's why it looks like you guys want strength, strength, the gang.

355
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:35,500
Equally as important. Let's, um, whoops. Uh, would that go equally as important?

356
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:41,909
I'm going to actually put this, where am I going to put this fucking thing? All right. So as you see,

357
01:05:43,050 --> 01:05:53,030
uh, here are what we have for points right now. Skeletal mage. You get left is summoning,

358
01:05:53,030 --> 01:06:01,110
middle is bone, right is curse. Don't have to pick a, don't have to pick a category anymore.

359
01:06:01,110 --> 01:06:16,969
Just what do you want me to do? What do you want the point to go? Interesting. Very interesting.

360
01:06:17,690 --> 01:06:43,300
Interesting. Let me give this about two seconds. Iron golem it is. Thanks for voting.

361
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:55,190
And we're going to go like this and iron golem now has one point in it. And just in case you

362
01:06:55,190 --> 01:07:07,219
needed to know, needed to see it over here. Here we go. Iron golem iron golem. You have to transform

363
01:07:07,219 --> 01:07:14,619
a metal object. So you need something, a weapon or armor and, uh, takes on the properties of that

364
01:07:14,619 --> 01:07:23,400
item. And then also it has thorns. So 150% of all damage it takes, it returns it back to the attacker.

365
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:42,900
So, um, so the axe now, what do I lose? I'll turn, I'll turn him, I'll make him from this.

366
01:07:43,539 --> 01:07:54,760
Just hope he doesn't die. Oh no, this is not, it's no, no, no, I can't wear this. This is two-handed.

367
01:07:54,760 --> 01:08:08,570
I lose two to gray skeleton. Nope. I thought it was one-handed. This is not made out of metal.

368
01:08:08,570 --> 01:08:29,800
I mean, it's, it's, yes it is. This ring. Watch this. Ready? Check this out. Uh, does that work

369
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:44,699
on rings? I thought it worked on rings. There he is. And he's made out of a rare. So he's

370
01:08:44,699 --> 01:08:55,750
fucking awesome. He gets all the properties from what we just did. Good luck taking this down.

371
01:08:55,750 --> 01:09:05,939
Just don't exit the game for a while and don't get him killed. All right. Well, there's that quest.

372
01:09:05,939 --> 01:09:17,029
Now we need to talk to Asherah. I think it's down here and then believe. No, that's probably, uh,

373
01:09:17,029 --> 01:09:32,359
where's it? It will carry over when you leave the game. Pretty sick. Our armor. All right. The act

374
01:09:32,359 --> 01:09:39,159
three, the act three mercenaries are awesome, but I don't want to lose, uh,

375
01:09:39,159 --> 01:09:54,869
Vic. How many golems can you have? Only one. But the more points you put into golems, the more

376
01:09:55,909 --> 01:10:01,159
powerful that that single one becomes to the point where it becomes its own character

377
01:10:01,239 --> 01:10:12,789
that is unstoppable. All right. So now I can hire, I can hire, but I'm not going to get rid of Vic

378
01:10:12,789 --> 01:10:29,050
because it's good. I like the aura. Okay. Quest completed. Now we just have to find this stupid

379
01:10:29,050 --> 01:10:37,560
thing in the spider cavern. I'm going back to the waypoint. Spider forest, spider cavern. That's a

380
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:54,229
ractid lair, not the correct one. What are you shooting at? Do the gold birdie thing? Yeah,

381
01:10:54,229 --> 01:10:59,239
but isn't that, that's a random drop though. The gold birdie quest is a random drop outside,

382
01:10:59,239 --> 01:11:12,250
right? From a champion. Where the hell can I go this way to the left here? List waiting room.

383
01:11:14,199 --> 01:11:21,289
I wish I had a ding, ding, ding ready. Like you're the first person to say that we were waiting for

384
01:11:21,289 --> 01:11:40,439
somebody. So you won. You won. What was the name? What do they win? Many people have said that.

385
01:11:42,069 --> 01:11:45,609
Well, that's the first one that I've noticed from, I thought it was another one.

386
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:57,880
Raul or Tao. I'm giving you your first rune word. Raul or Tao. Remember that one?

387
01:12:17,130 --> 01:12:23,260
Now we're in the great marsh. Where is the spider cavern? That's my lightning resist. Pretty bad.

388
01:12:23,899 --> 01:12:39,829
He kind of looks like a skeleton too, the waypoint. No, I don't want to be here.

389
01:12:40,470 --> 01:12:52,170
I need to go into, I need to find the spider cavern. Can you get a McChicken? I don't know,

390
01:12:52,170 --> 01:12:59,420
that depends. How far away is the McDonald's from where you live? You have a car. You have Uber Eats

391
01:12:59,420 --> 01:13:09,659
available or one of those other apps. And you walk. I mean, are you in an area where I can just take

392
01:13:09,659 --> 01:13:15,989
a walk, the sidewalk so I can get there. And you can figure it out. I can't help you there. I can't

393
01:13:15,989 --> 01:13:30,250
be the one. I can't help you. There's not much more that I can do. Google.com. You live at

394
01:13:30,250 --> 01:13:35,939
McDonald's. How do you guys say McDonald's? Do you guys say McDonald's or do you guys say like

395
01:13:35,939 --> 01:13:47,939
McDonald's? McDonald's. McDonald's. Which one? You guys say McDonald's. McDonald's. McDonald's.

396
01:13:50,729 --> 01:14:18,600
All right. I think I'm going crazy. Where is the spider cavern? This has to be this way. It has to

397
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:56,010
be right down here. This is it, right? This is it right here. This is it. Oh, it's not it. Act three

398
01:14:56,010 --> 01:15:17,100
Pepe laugh. Yeah. He's missing chests like this. I'm fine. Okay. I'm okay. Mages dying so quickly.

399
01:15:17,819 --> 01:15:36,229
Spider cavern. I'm running out of stamina. It was really entertaining for a second when you asked

400
01:15:36,229 --> 01:15:41,909
us how to pronounce McDonald's. Thanks. That was a cool conversation. You're right.

401
01:15:47,289 --> 01:15:51,130
Terraria stream 2.0. You're walking around letting your minions do everything.

402
01:16:00,779 --> 01:16:05,579
Is this what it feels like if somebody comes in to like the store you work at and complains

403
01:16:05,579 --> 01:16:13,159
about something that you don't have control over? So I came in yesterday and there was,

404
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:17,960
I was going to buy this book. Why do you not have more than two of those books in your inventory?

405
01:16:19,689 --> 01:16:27,369
I don't, I don't, we, I don't fucking know. I don't know. Well, why don't you? What are you idiot?

406
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:31,930
No, I don't, I have nothing to do with what kind of inventory we get. I just work here.

407
01:16:32,890 --> 01:16:44,380
We just don't, somebody bought them. Somebody picked skeleton mages. Why did you do that? I

408
01:16:44,380 --> 01:17:08,100
didn't, but you did though. Get me the manager. No, they've been so, that's been, that's been a

409
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:12,579
buzz kill. The rumors are really, that was going to be a huge one. And then they went,

410
01:17:12,579 --> 01:17:26,939
no, no, no, no, no. I look forward to them now somehow. Yeah. I'm, I'm, I'm sorry. I didn't,

411
01:17:26,939 --> 01:17:35,369
I didn't pick that. Uh, chat did. Why do you associate with them? Um, because they're here.

412
01:17:36,090 --> 01:17:42,920
Well, why are you letting them in? It's part of what I, what is it what I do? That's what I'm

413
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:51,800
doing. We're in the flier jungle again. All right. Have I lost my fucking mind? It's been a while

414
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:59,829
since I played. Oh my God. I forgot about those guys. Normie build. Oh my God. Okay. Seriously.

415
01:17:59,829 --> 01:18:06,739
I can't die to this. I will die. Yeah. I just, I was in here yesterday and it looks like you're

416
01:18:06,739 --> 01:18:24,659
doing a normie build. I'd like to make a return on, on the bits that I gave because you're doing a

417
01:18:24,659 --> 01:18:34,069
normie build. And then this drops. Oops. Well, I actually just did break something. It drops like

418
01:18:34,069 --> 01:18:40,699
a big container. It's like shattered glass in it. Uh, man, did you drop this down the stairs?

419
01:18:41,340 --> 01:19:04,539
Why does it matter? I have my receipt and no, it was an elevator shaft. Oh, are you all right?

420
01:19:04,539 --> 01:19:24,680
How have I not found this? I'm going to lose my mind. It's not, how have I not found the spider

421
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:50,649
cavern? Dude, the golem's dead. He's dead. It always takes forever. I know. But how have I,

422
01:19:50,649 --> 01:20:00,359
I look at all the, I've covered so much ground. Uh, he's not dead. He's alive and he doesn't get

423
01:20:00,359 --> 01:20:17,529
to be as cool. All right. I'm going to say maybe closer to town. Let's go downtown. He's a washed

424
01:20:17,529 --> 01:20:36,579
up Diablo bro. Yeah. I know. Down this way. It's not the one. It's not our favorite one.

425
01:20:37,220 --> 01:20:44,420
All right. What about that way down here? Cause this is the arachnid layer. It has to be close

426
01:20:44,420 --> 01:20:54,260
to this. Below it maybe. Cause that's the arachnid layer, not the spider cavern. There's no other way

427
01:20:54,260 --> 01:21:12,500
to go that way. So it has to be over here. Down this way. Maybe over there. You need to look up

428
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:16,659
a walk through. No, walk through this. It's randomly generated. There's no walk through will help me.

429
01:21:17,619 --> 01:21:52,229
Over here. There's some, yeah. Right here. I see us. Oh, this is a great marsh. Hold on. Let me

430
01:21:52,229 --> 01:22:14,979
look at the full map. Is it down here? Cause the, the, wait, it might've, it might be down here.

431
01:22:15,859 --> 01:22:35,689
Did I just miss it or something down this way? Oh, don't tell me it's right here. I've walked

432
01:22:35,689 --> 01:22:42,659
past it. No, that was the arachnid layer. It's not the same one. Hold on. Let me stand still.

433
01:22:45,239 --> 01:22:48,920
All right. It's probably right here. I probably just didn't see it like in the corner.

434
01:22:57,989 --> 01:23:20,579
No, no, it would be purple. What a pain in the ass. Yes, I know. Search for his eye in the spider

435
01:23:20,659 --> 01:23:41,779
cavern. I wish you could tell me where it was. All right. I'm going to walk out the front door

436
01:23:41,779 --> 01:23:52,380
again. No, give me stamina potions. Be connected to the flayer jungle. Yeah. That's what I thought

437
01:23:52,380 --> 01:24:08,220
too. Act three. It's great. You don't even sell stamina potions. Do I ever like to go through

438
01:24:08,220 --> 01:24:35,460
another act to get them? Jesus Christ. All right. Let's go. Hey, what the hell do you want?

439
01:24:36,420 --> 01:24:50,779
What are you doing here? Daryl's dead. Fuck off already. All right. What we got? Not here.

440
01:24:50,779 --> 01:25:12,810
It would be over here. Nope. It would be right here. Nope. We do the left that way. I think it

441
01:25:12,810 --> 01:25:20,380
might be somewhere. Me too. That's the great. No, that's the great marsh over there. Dermot,

442
01:25:20,380 --> 01:25:25,100
you were already there. No, that was the arachnid layer. That was not the spider cavern. I already

443
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:40,699
went inside the arachnid layer. It's two different dungeons. Look, look what I found. Just a sliver

444
01:25:40,699 --> 01:25:59,420
on the side and it's guaranteed to be right here. Spider cavern. What do you mean rude?

445
01:26:01,050 --> 01:26:05,369
Wait, how was me saying fucking what the fuck? You fucking dumb. How is that rude?

446
01:26:07,180 --> 01:26:11,340
I'm just making like a point. I'm saying like stupid fucking goddamn fucking comment.

447
01:26:11,340 --> 01:26:14,979
But is that rude? Just trying to be like agreeable, you know.

448
01:26:14,979 --> 01:26:39,239
You're being a bully. Oh, nope. You should put on a mature content filter. Look at all this crap I

449
01:26:39,239 --> 01:26:48,810
have. I have so many stamina. I thought it was going to take so much longer too. If we can get

450
01:26:48,810 --> 01:27:01,220
the eye. What's the deal with airline food? It's actually kind of good now. Snacks are pretty top

451
01:27:01,220 --> 01:27:11,609
tier. I've had like those like eat up boxes from JetBlue. They're pretty great actually. They're

452
01:27:11,609 --> 01:27:16,810
really good. It's like you can get like six bucks or something. You can get a like this like sausage

453
01:27:16,810 --> 01:27:21,770
jerky cheese like crackers and they're like they're like nice brands too. It's actually kind of good

454
01:27:21,770 --> 01:27:42,090
now. No seriously. When was the last time you guys had uh I mean obviously depends on what airline

455
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:55,079
you're on but by JetBlue you got a plenty of options. Oh did I mention more non-stop flights

456
01:27:55,079 --> 01:28:17,180
than any airline in the country? Something like that. How's iron doing? Good. Rich streamer eats

457
01:28:17,180 --> 01:28:24,069
airline food for lunch every day. That would probably not. I wouldn't want that. I wouldn't

458
01:28:24,069 --> 01:28:43,739
want to eat airplane food every day. I feel like something bad might happen. Skeleton mages keep

459
01:28:43,739 --> 01:28:58,539
dying. They're almost getting to the point where they're unsummonable. My airplane food is for

460
01:28:58,539 --> 01:29:34,010
airplanes. Gasoline. I'm trying to lose health too. I can't just be an idiot. No wrong. Oh a scepter.

461
01:29:34,649 --> 01:29:38,890
I'm not playing as paladin though. Unfortunately not a paladin.

462
01:29:44,810 --> 01:29:51,050
Balanced. There's all knives should be. Give that person. Give that person a raise.

463
01:30:02,819 --> 01:30:07,380
Lightning? No just wrong. Oh don't get hit. Don't get hit. Don't get hit. I have amplify damage on

464
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:14,970
me. It means I can die in one hit. There's a jade figurine. That's a good one to have.

465
01:30:17,029 --> 01:30:26,699
There's the random quest. Man that guy just won the internet.

466
01:30:30,939 --> 01:30:43,289
That guy just won the internet. Dude. All right we have the figurine now. Let's get out of here.

467
01:30:49,270 --> 01:30:55,750
Meshef told me he had a fondness for jade figurines. On his trading voyages he could

468
01:30:55,750 --> 01:31:02,579
put a strange little figurine into such small statues. Show him the ashes of Guile that

469
01:31:02,579 --> 01:31:10,680
mixed with you a potion. Only it can reveal the true path to Mephisto. Is the game quiet?

470
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:17,079
Face the eye in the Herodric Cube along with Kaleem's other relics. The heart, the brain,

471
01:31:17,079 --> 01:31:31,180
and the flail. I don't know. It is. All right search for Kaleem's brain in the flayer dungeon.

472
01:31:31,739 --> 01:31:35,899
Now we go to Meshef. Say hey Meshef. What do you think about this?

473
01:31:43,689 --> 01:31:55,180
Well it's still holy. I wish I'd never returned to this accursed place. Praise you. That jade

474
01:31:55,180 --> 01:32:00,859
figurine will complete the set I was collecting here. I've had the statuette of a golden bird

475
01:32:00,859 --> 01:32:15,380
for years but I consider it a fair exchange. I low sell high. Ask Cain about the bird. Oh

476
01:32:15,380 --> 01:32:21,050
that's worth way more than what you came with. You should try to sell that to somebody for a profit

477
01:32:22,010 --> 01:32:28,220
even though it might not be even worth a tenth of what you're getting for it. I've read legends

478
01:32:28,220 --> 01:32:36,539
about a sage named Cuile who studied the mysteries of life beyond death. If I remember correctly

479
01:32:37,260 --> 01:32:44,119
his ashes were ensconced within a golden statuette. It was a very strange tale.

480
01:32:46,170 --> 01:32:55,720
Give the golden bird to Alcor. This is where you get something awesome. This is where you get

481
01:32:55,720 --> 01:33:04,409
a cool item. The golden bird of Cuile? Thank you my friend. Busy yourself when I experiment with

482
01:33:04,409 --> 01:33:10,819
the ashes within it. Then return and see what I've made for you. Return to Alcor.

483
01:33:11,300 --> 01:33:17,539
And okay. What do you got? From the ashes of Cuile I have mixed for you a potion.

484
01:33:19,220 --> 01:33:42,010
Got it. That potion is permanently increased 20 to your health. What?

485
01:33:42,890 --> 01:33:53,850
Come on. I think I'm that dumb. 286? All right we're on the right track now. That's actually

486
01:33:53,850 --> 01:33:59,529
kind of annoying to do these two in a row. You have to find the Gidvan which kind of sucks

487
01:33:59,529 --> 01:34:04,789
and then this randomly drops from a champion or higher monster. So got them both knocked out of

488
01:34:04,789 --> 01:34:09,819
the park right away. Now you've got to go to the Flare Dungeon get Gleam's brain. That does not

489
01:34:09,819 --> 01:34:14,779
pick the loot. No. Otherwise I actually would probably not be able to even complete a single

490
01:34:14,779 --> 01:34:35,880
mission in the game. All right you can pick a couple of these. All right Gleam's Eye. Rao?

491
01:34:36,979 --> 01:34:40,100
We have a nice little rune collection here. Oh I already have a Rao.

492
01:34:42,380 --> 01:35:04,810
I flood the market with Rao's and then dump it. Raar. Get out of here. Why? What's the point?

493
01:35:08,010 --> 01:35:12,489
You know I look over and I envy some. I like want to be that person that just says like

494
01:35:12,489 --> 01:35:19,460
Raar XD and some stream. You know what I mean? That's like that's just so you can do. You can

495
01:35:19,460 --> 01:35:27,000
say anything. It doesn't even matter. Like I want to be and yes I have I've made plenty of

496
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:31,880
alt accounts in my on Twitch. You've seen some of them already like binary man zero one zero zero

497
01:35:31,880 --> 01:35:39,350
one one one zero right? But I just want to be the guy in the chat that just writes like

498
01:35:39,350 --> 01:35:43,590
laughing my ass off. When when do you get Gleam's poo poo right? Somebody said that. I didn't react

499
01:35:43,590 --> 01:35:58,229
to it but like imagine being that person. Sometimes I envy you being up being able to do that. That's

500
01:35:58,229 --> 01:36:04,149
the dream. That's the dream. Someone did say that. Yes they did and I looked over and I was like

501
01:36:04,149 --> 01:36:11,159
mother fucker. But I was you know that could have been me. All right we're going to clear uh

502
01:36:11,159 --> 01:36:23,979
where is it? It's closer. Uh what's stopping you? Um I don't know the respect of my peers

503
01:36:25,210 --> 01:36:55,140
or something. He thinks he has respect. aircraft lost all respect.

504
01:36:56,739 --> 01:37:02,779
So you're saying that you lost all your respect for me in 2012? What are you still doing here?

505
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:18,380
I'm here being angry. Why are you hate watching me right now? Am I being hate watched? Is that

506
01:37:18,380 --> 01:37:27,979
what's going on? I look for the uh flare dungeon. There it is. Now look at how easy that was compared

507
01:37:27,979 --> 01:38:01,060
to the other one. All right get in there. I'm not killing you. Take a look. 10 to 26. Uh he has a

508
01:38:01,060 --> 01:38:05,380
unique on right now right? And this thing's much better. Notice how he has not been in any trouble

509
01:38:05,380 --> 01:38:12,890
at all. He's healing 10% of his health per hit. This guy's this is going to be a perfect boss

510
01:38:12,890 --> 01:38:35,739
friend. Four mages now and five still. What? Careful that the fire can melt you instantly

511
01:38:36,779 --> 01:38:49,800
as you've seen. Very very dangerous. Sometimes I feel like we're all just the people who slow

512
01:38:49,800 --> 01:39:14,380
down to look at the car accident. Um that's an interesting thought but no it's inaccurate.

513
01:39:15,699 --> 01:39:23,189
This would be like you seeing car accident pulling over getting out of the car sitting

514
01:39:23,189 --> 01:39:27,750
on the curb and watching the rest of the accident and everything play out and like the police report

515
01:39:27,750 --> 01:39:46,600
and stuff. And it takes like six hours or so and you fall asleep on the curb. You just sleep in

516
01:39:46,600 --> 01:39:54,310
there. Eventually cop comes over and he's like hey um you good? Oh yeah yeah yeah it was just like

517
01:39:55,109 --> 01:39:59,750
glad to see that. I was oh yeah I'm going to bed. I'm going I'm going to bed. Bye Jerma.

518
01:40:00,390 --> 01:40:40,409
Wait what are you talking about? While mocking the accident. Wait you wait you you know it looks

519
01:40:40,409 --> 01:40:51,050
just a fender bender. Why did you not see that car? Look at his look at his bumper. You you broke

520
01:40:51,050 --> 01:41:01,939
that bumper. And then you over here the cop. Sir I'm gonna have to ask you to step out of the car.

521
01:41:01,939 --> 01:41:25,510
Oh oh mama s. All right I could die in here. I need friends. I know I have to I can't not I

522
01:41:25,510 --> 01:41:32,329
can't just start talking random shit in hardcore. I know I have a bunch of people playing the game

523
01:41:32,329 --> 01:41:47,189
for me. Okay okay. Okay okay I have to stop fucking around. This is I don't if I lose it I

524
01:41:47,189 --> 01:42:12,470
can't just respawn. Mom said it was my turn. Well your mom is not my mom. Well I don't have

525
01:42:12,470 --> 01:42:29,720
to listen to your mom. My mom said it was okay. Watch out for traps. All right it's down here.

526
01:42:56,979 --> 01:42:59,539
Guys are dead. These guys are dead.

527
01:43:09,560 --> 01:43:17,289
Watch out Jerma the the soul the killers the flares are coming.

528
01:43:18,170 --> 01:43:42,500
Come on give me a unique ring. I think it's all worth it. Unique ring. That was I'm gonna put that

529
01:43:42,500 --> 01:43:50,859
on if that was plus three to uh skeletons. A lot of death in there. That's a scary room.

530
01:43:51,659 --> 01:44:04,010
Oh if. Cool yeah I don't know why but for a long time when I was younger I thought it was

531
01:44:04,010 --> 01:44:29,779
re-enjuvenation potion. Level two here we go. Oh you were a stupid kid.

532
01:44:29,779 --> 01:44:55,670
Paladin only. You know I can't I want to write that. I hate paladins. What about you?

533
01:44:56,630 --> 01:45:00,149
Paladins are fun to play because you feel like you're contributing.

534
01:45:01,510 --> 01:45:08,390
When you used to walk into a lobby and people would say like oh paladin yeah what kind of paladin

535
01:45:08,390 --> 01:45:15,189
would you like? Oh all defensive defensive paladin. I don't even have any moves. I just

536
01:45:15,189 --> 01:45:21,350
had 20 points 25 plus points is some of the best defensive or you just walk next to people and just

537
01:45:21,350 --> 01:45:46,949
chatted. You're just a walking buff. Wow kind of like how you're doing this now. Kind of.

538
01:45:52,199 --> 01:46:07,989
So take a rating. No I'm participating. I'm making them take a hundred percent more damage.

539
01:46:08,550 --> 01:46:27,590
That's participation. Are you guys the skeletons? Yeah. Watch out guys.

540
01:46:28,550 --> 01:46:42,630
We got a raid. Watch out. Here comes a raid from a channel. We did it. We defended.

541
01:46:58,420 --> 01:47:04,890
Yeah I think you know what I figured it out. I figured it out. That is me chatting in a random

542
01:47:04,890 --> 01:47:10,979
fucking stream. What I just did right there. I do that all the time. I do shit like that all the

543
01:47:10,979 --> 01:47:34,199
fucking time. Though I do get to participate in that. No they all left. They away from the fire.

544
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:36,119
Look at he killed all the skeletons.

545
01:47:43,939 --> 01:47:51,159
What streamers do you watch? That's a pretty cool question.

546
01:47:52,039 --> 01:47:56,600
Uh I open up my own VODs and watch them back every night. I really like that guy.

547
01:48:08,869 --> 01:48:42,439
Level three. Here it is. Out here somewhere. It's an ego. Um is it? Stop stepping on shit.

548
01:48:43,079 --> 01:48:45,479
You're stepping on it. Oh these guys are running over all the traps.

549
01:48:46,199 --> 01:48:53,060
Fuck. That just saved my life whatever it was. I don't know what it was but it saved my life

550
01:48:53,060 --> 01:49:01,579
freezing because they all stopped. Oh my god I have to leave. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out.

551
01:49:01,579 --> 01:49:05,420
I have to leave because these guys are going to come. No I'm kidding. Alright everyone get in.

552
01:49:05,420 --> 01:49:12,810
Get in here please. Everybody get in. Jeez they all started standing outside.

553
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:25,720
If those two guys with fire came over I may have died. That was kind of terrifying. I have no way

554
01:49:25,720 --> 01:49:47,000
to defend myself. I just have skeletons. I just have friends and death is permanent so I can't

555
01:49:47,000 --> 01:50:20,619
walk around. It's called mess. What a mess. What a mess. What a mess. Wait doesn't it say hardcore

556
01:50:20,619 --> 01:50:28,409
on the top right when you're in hardcore mode? What are you talking about? Well you watched me

557
01:50:28,409 --> 01:50:46,649
select it right? Yeah you guys you guys watched me check the box. Does it? Oh got him. Okay don't

558
01:50:46,649 --> 01:50:51,510
scare me like that. Not like it matters. If this character dies I could just delete him. Like if

559
01:50:51,989 --> 01:51:05,050
it's not like that changes very much. I'm very paranoid in this room though because of these

560
01:51:05,050 --> 01:51:26,140
things. These guys are a pain in the ass. Fire zero. Hey you should do a killed by enemy joke.

561
01:51:27,340 --> 01:51:43,529
It'd be kind of funny actually. It'd be really funny. Come on where is it? Come on.

562
01:51:43,529 --> 01:51:57,140
Come on. Come on. Explored almost the whole thing. Where's the chest? Over here. Bang on the left.

563
01:51:59,640 --> 01:52:06,359
And don't go too far because wait for everyone to get here. This corner. There it is. All right.

564
01:52:06,359 --> 01:52:12,260
There's a champion there and there's lightning and shit in here. Yeah I ain't going in.

565
01:52:13,399 --> 01:52:26,739
Fuck that. You guys do it for me. Oh yep immune to fire. Just kill them. I don't want nothing

566
01:52:26,739 --> 01:52:41,979
to do with that. Good. Nice work. That's another unique. All right. Hold on. Yeah. Is this shield?

567
01:52:49,479 --> 01:52:56,439
Oh no. It's it's ethereal. It can't be repaired. It can. I can only use this until it breaks.

568
01:53:04,310 --> 01:53:22,739
50% chance to block. 50% chance of open wounds. Tart it into a golem. Yeah probably.

569
01:53:22,739 --> 01:53:37,720
I can't carry anymore. All right. Let me just put this. Damn it. That would be a pretty cool.

570
01:53:38,439 --> 01:53:47,130
That'd be 50% chance to bleed. That would be cool actually. Let me make a ruby.

571
01:53:51,180 --> 01:53:59,300
Time to clean up this inventory. Pissing me off. Okay. Time to clean my room. All right.

572
01:53:59,300 --> 01:54:04,470
I'm cleaning my room. F. How many F's do I have? Um yeah. Time to clean the room.

573
01:54:06,569 --> 01:54:30,140
If uh-oh guys. I can't make mules. I can't make more than one character to store things.

574
01:54:30,939 --> 01:54:44,199
That's a problem. I love collecting items. Open bnet. I can't even use open bnet. Apparently I

575
01:54:44,199 --> 01:54:55,989
did something so awful. So rotten and terrible that I'm banned from open battle net as well.

576
01:54:56,069 --> 01:55:04,470
Even open bnet. Yes. Where hacking is legal. Hacking is legal on open bnet.

577
01:55:16,250 --> 01:55:33,289
I ring scammed too many people. No. I don't understand. Let me clean my room. Let's sell

578
01:55:33,289 --> 01:55:54,729
this ship. Cloud skull banned from open bnet as well. There are people that like speed hack

579
01:55:54,729 --> 01:56:00,069
and teleport around in open bnet. There are people that have modded characters running around with

580
01:56:00,069 --> 01:56:07,479
five million of every stat in open bnet. What the hell did I do to not be allowed in that?

581
01:56:07,479 --> 01:56:31,000
Wait. Let me sell. I think it's time to. Yeah. Let's clean my room. Time to clean the room.

582
01:56:33,380 --> 01:57:07,670
What are we doing on diamonds? We're good. All right. Keep writing. All right. Guys.

583
01:57:08,310 --> 01:57:21,770
Let's take a look at the skills. We got a skill point to use. Please. Use it. You need some

584
01:57:21,770 --> 01:57:27,939
reminders. Of course this is the summoning tree again. This is blood golem. This is iron golem.

585
01:57:28,819 --> 01:57:32,279
This is fire golem. But I don't think we can't do that yet. I don't think.

586
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:42,229
This is just to make sure you can see. All right. You can see. Where's the skill point going?

587
01:57:44,380 --> 01:58:10,100
Vote. No. Dim vision gang. Curses are important but we're neglecting them.

588
01:58:10,819 --> 01:58:25,590
When I say we but I mean you. When I say you. I mean you. 212 of you that clicked on teeth.

589
01:58:26,470 --> 01:58:39,350
I don't even know what you're clicking on over here. Make sure you try to differentiate so

590
01:58:39,350 --> 01:58:58,260
the blob doesn't go together. Which one do you want me to do? I can't even do the guys.

591
01:58:58,260 --> 01:59:08,760
Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Look. I can't do the fire one. That's level 30. I am currently level 26.

592
01:59:09,560 --> 01:59:22,229
I can't do that yet. Fire golems not available. Fire golem receives but you got to figure out.

593
01:59:22,229 --> 01:59:30,279
You guys. I think you guys are lost. What do you want? Figure it out. Skeletons. Powerful golems.

594
01:59:30,279 --> 01:59:34,680
Do you want me to you know what I mean? This hit by the way revive is a thing in the game as well.

595
01:59:34,680 --> 01:59:43,720
It revives any monster in the whole game. They fight for you instead. Fire golem. Iron golem.

596
01:59:43,720 --> 01:59:57,930
They all get benefits from each other. Golem mastery. Okay. We've seen it. Also this is what's

597
01:59:57,930 --> 02:00:05,909
available in poison and bone. This is what's available in curses. Iron maiden. Weaken. There's

598
02:00:05,909 --> 02:00:10,470
also decrepify. Curses a group of enemies to make them slow, weak, and take amplified damage.

599
02:00:12,869 --> 02:00:20,039
Lower resist. These seem kind of cool. These are cool too. All right. What do you want?

600
02:00:20,039 --> 02:00:22,600
Pick it again. This time know that I can't go doing things in the bottom.

601
02:00:23,479 --> 02:00:41,060
And make sure you're clicking in the correct spot to differentiate your vote from manipulating us.

602
02:00:51,930 --> 02:01:03,210
Well. Still clicking on the fire golem. And revive. 20% of the people that have clicked so far

603
02:01:04,170 --> 02:01:21,850
still don't get it. We are going to click on iron golem. Okay. Bone wall.

604
02:01:22,649 --> 02:01:30,390
Another point in iron. Let's see what it does. Here we go. Just, you know, so you can see to make

605
02:01:30,390 --> 02:01:39,659
sure that I'm doing, I'm actually clicking these. Remembering them. So this is going to bring,

606
02:01:40,300 --> 02:01:50,810
it's going to bring the thorns up to 165%. Almost double the defense. What's the attack turn into?

607
02:01:50,810 --> 02:02:04,710
Seven to nine. Let's see. Yeah. Huge defense increase and more thorns. All right. Stat points.

608
02:02:04,710 --> 02:02:11,020
You know what to do. You guys are smart. You know what to do. By the way, if you don't know,

609
02:02:11,020 --> 02:02:16,939
strength is melee damage and wearing heavy equipment. Dexterity is how often you hit

610
02:02:16,939 --> 02:02:23,829
enemies in your defense. How often you obviously don't get hit. Vitality, health and stamina.

611
02:02:23,829 --> 02:03:01,770
Energy is just mana pool. More mana. Getting close to a tier list. What is the right choice?

612
02:03:02,649 --> 02:03:11,270
Um, if you're talking about a super duper min max build. No, why would I even tell you?

613
02:03:21,619 --> 02:03:36,710
Vitality. Vitality. At least you guys are doing that. If you guys actually did put every point

614
02:03:36,710 --> 02:03:43,640
to strength. Remember when I took that fire damage down to here without this extra 150,

615
02:03:43,640 --> 02:03:51,449
whatever, a hundred plus health. I'm dead. Cleaned my room a little bit.

616
02:03:54,220 --> 02:04:01,979
Stored some gold just in case I die. And then, you know, my heirs don't get it. All right. We

617
02:04:01,979 --> 02:04:12,300
need to get the heart. Not the heart. The brain, right? Kaleem's brain. How many sloths are in

618
02:04:12,300 --> 02:04:22,899
here? Three. Five to fifteen. Hold on. This is most fortunate. Kaleem's brain knows Mephisto's

619
02:04:22,899 --> 02:04:29,859
weakness. Place it in the Herodric Cube along with Kaleem's other relics. The eye, the heart,

620
02:04:29,859 --> 02:04:45,699
and the flail. The eye, the heart, the brain, and the flail. I don't wonder

621
02:04:45,859 --> 02:05:09,319
what Wizard of Oz character wanted that. This guy's still alive. Wow. Yes, I'm doing fine.

622
02:05:09,960 --> 02:05:24,090
All right. If I do, we do fire and ice. Fire, ice, and poison. All in one. All right. Yeah,

623
02:05:24,090 --> 02:05:29,850
I'm going to do, let's go, let's go to the fountain drink thing and just get like Coke, Diet Coke,

624
02:05:29,850 --> 02:05:45,960
Sprite, Pepsi, the high C. Let's just do it all. This is eight to twelve fire damage. The five

625
02:05:45,960 --> 02:05:54,180
percent life per hit is not going to do it for me. Let's go. Look, later on in the game,

626
02:05:54,180 --> 02:06:11,260
these are going to drop all the time anyways. Oh, shit. Five to thirty fire damage. That's

627
02:06:11,260 --> 02:06:16,979
pretty good. Oh, shit. I got two of these. I got two of these. No, we're just going Diet Coke.

628
02:06:16,979 --> 02:06:28,119
We're just going to go Diet Coke. All right. Eighteen to seventy-two fire damage. And I got,

629
02:06:28,119 --> 02:06:38,939
all right, let's see. Oh, fuck. Yeah, let's go. Thirty-five to a hundred and three damage.

630
02:06:38,939 --> 02:06:50,340
It's just raw, raw. What class are we again? We are summoning Necromancer, but Chad is doing this

631
02:06:50,340 --> 02:06:58,149
laugh out loud scenario where they put most of my points into strength. So if I'm going to have

632
02:06:58,149 --> 02:07:02,970
more than sixty to a hundred strength, then I might as well swing a weapon at somebody

633
02:07:02,970 --> 02:07:09,130
because they have not given me any offensive move. I have a shield and a bunch of skeleton friends.

634
02:07:09,130 --> 02:07:29,460
That's it. This is just what's happening. Look at this thing. See, like the red, the red. All

635
02:07:29,460 --> 02:07:40,939
right. Colleen's heart is in the sewers under the Curest Bazaar. This guy's complaining even

636
02:07:40,939 --> 02:07:48,630
though he's got one tooth. Yeah. No, right. I do have an offensive ability. Let's see how much

637
02:07:48,630 --> 02:08:08,760
damage it does. Teeth. Yeah. Okay. Right. Okay. So that's that's comparable. All right. Wait,

638
02:08:08,760 --> 02:08:17,689
wait, wait, wait. I got to go back. We got to go back up to the Flare Jungle. Not me. I want you

639
02:08:17,689 --> 02:08:25,510
to succeed. That's why I'm clicking on Constitution every time. Thanks. Dentist build. You can do a

640
02:08:25,510 --> 02:08:32,039
dentist build. You just put all your points in the teeth and then all your points into bone

641
02:08:32,039 --> 02:08:41,399
sphere and shit. You can have like 50 teeth come up. Dude, I'm going to destroy everybody with this

642
02:08:41,399 --> 02:08:56,869
build. I'm doing a lot of damage. It's not even without this is without amplify on. Am I really

643
02:08:56,869 --> 02:09:06,260
out of stamina? Tier list stream. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Yeah. All right. Next level

644
02:09:06,260 --> 02:09:26,649
up. I'm going to do the next tier list. We're going to keep going up to the Curest Bazaar.

645
02:09:27,289 --> 02:10:04,119
I believe it's this way. This way. Poison. Uh-huh. That was the Gitvin. Hang on. Right.

646
02:10:05,079 --> 02:10:21,460
Let's get to the Bazaar. I thought they were on the other team for a second.

647
02:10:22,180 --> 02:10:33,640
Uh, no. Keep going up. We can't. Where are the trees? The weird tree enemies are scary.

648
02:10:35,079 --> 02:10:51,779
Oh, I missed three times. Bone Master needs bone abilities.

649
02:10:51,779 --> 02:11:17,779
This is the heart maybe. See the fire when I hit people. It's so cool. It's that little

650
02:11:17,779 --> 02:11:40,329
explosion. It goes, why are you killing? This is a, this is a war for good. This is a war for good

651
02:11:40,329 --> 02:12:04,979
and evil, man. Hell's demons versus the rest of us. Easy. This is demons versus me and you.

652
02:12:04,979 --> 02:12:27,159
Everyone's still alive. This is pretty great. You're with the demons. How could you?

653
02:12:29,699 --> 02:12:41,180
Traitor. Oh, Iron Golem's dead. I mean, there was too much overwhelming. Overwhelming.

654
02:12:43,020 --> 02:13:03,270
You got to close the game. What? It's hardcore for my minions too. Oh, fuck. That was bad.

655
02:13:05,029 --> 02:13:28,710
That could have been. How long until Fire Golem friend, people heaven.

656
02:13:30,300 --> 02:13:37,109
Uh, we need four more levels. I'm assuming before we finished act three, you'll see, uh,

657
02:13:37,109 --> 02:13:41,510
Fire Golem maybe ends. And if your fellow chat members also would like to see that

658
02:13:43,739 --> 02:14:02,140
fight indecisive recently, we spread out. I don't like being spread out. Uh, Vic leveled up.

659
02:14:03,579 --> 02:14:18,010
I was, you know, I forgot if I'm going to hold things in my inventory, I might as well just

660
02:14:18,010 --> 02:14:40,329
see what they are on the way to Bazzar. I don't use Kane to identify things because on the fly,

661
02:14:40,649 --> 02:14:43,829
I might want it. Plus there's not that much money.

662
02:14:47,050 --> 02:14:49,930
This might be better than what I have on right now. I don't want to go home for this.

663
02:14:51,210 --> 02:14:56,439
I mean, it's not, but it could have been, but yeah, it is. No, it's not. That's actually good

664
02:14:56,439 --> 02:15:06,199
too. 5% chance to cast Frost Nova. That's where that's coming from. You're impatient.

665
02:15:06,920 --> 02:15:13,180
That's what the point of the book is for. So I can trash it that I don't want. I'm going to

666
02:15:13,180 --> 02:15:34,020
keep going back to town. That's too, it's too far. The F rune ring. All right. Do I have enough

667
02:15:34,020 --> 02:15:40,020
for just even a shitty rune word? I know there's dozens and dozens and dozens of them in the game,

668
02:15:40,020 --> 02:15:52,470
but do I have any of the crappy ones? Uh, two or three slot armor? How F? What about three?

669
02:15:53,590 --> 02:16:05,989
How F, huh? It's called stealth. I might want to look that up.

670
02:16:05,989 --> 02:16:16,600
Here. Stealth would be pretty good.

671
02:16:22,760 --> 02:16:31,100
That's not even a real thing. What are you trying to get me to say? Okay. I'm trying to figure out

672
02:16:31,100 --> 02:16:46,809
what you're, what are you trying to get me to say? Here's my heart. Heart. Okay, but wouldn't it be

673
02:16:46,809 --> 02:17:03,579
just, uh, that's come on. I hope I don't miss anything. I still only have level one bone armor.

674
02:17:11,639 --> 02:17:15,479
Yo, that's right. Mr. Peanut fucking died. We talked about it in the pre-stream chat.

675
02:17:19,219 --> 02:17:23,940
We went over this for like 40 minutes, but imagine nobody caring about peanuts.

676
02:17:24,659 --> 02:17:35,450
Go point where you have to kill one of the most iconic food brand mascots and not just like,

677
02:17:35,450 --> 02:17:39,850
oh, we're discontinuing the use of Mr. Peanut. No, we're going, we're, we were going to kill him.

678
02:17:50,040 --> 02:18:03,690
Super bold marketing shit. We have to go back around. Wait, really? Yes, really. Yes. We've

679
02:18:03,690 --> 02:18:21,059
gone full, full kill somebody for memes. And I brought this up too. It's a really important

680
02:18:21,059 --> 02:18:28,540
point. I'm surprised none of the other serial characters have died. Like doesn't Sonny the

681
02:18:28,540 --> 02:18:32,459
Cocoa Puff Bird do crazy shit and like jump out of planes without parachutes and like

682
02:18:33,020 --> 02:18:55,899
crash his car into stuff? How is he still alive? Like the Trix Rabbit stalks children

683
02:18:56,709 --> 02:19:03,510
and steals from them. Should we be in prison by now? Okay. That was fucking close.

684
02:19:15,059 --> 02:19:29,459
That fire move is so deadly. That's the run killer. I need fire resistance. I don't even

685
02:19:29,459 --> 02:19:48,280
care if I put it on just even if I take something good off. That's it. All right, here we go. Player

686
02:19:48,280 --> 02:19:53,819
jungle, finally. And from here, we're going to go to the lower cuirass and then cuirass bazaar.

687
02:19:56,229 --> 02:20:12,180
Mr. Peanut Wiki. Yes, some of the other masked food mascots live so much more dangerous lives

688
02:20:12,180 --> 02:20:22,469
than Mr. Peanut. How often did Captain Crunch get raided by other pirates? They had like swords

689
02:20:22,469 --> 02:20:42,540
and guns and stuff. Tony the Tiger played soccer. He could have taken a football, a soccer ball

690
02:20:42,540 --> 02:20:51,829
right in the mouth and like broke his face and shit. Mr. Peanut just dances. He just dances.

691
02:20:51,829 --> 02:20:56,469
He just dances around. He's like, oh, Mr. Peanut, my PB crisps. It's not like he's

692
02:20:56,469 --> 02:21:11,780
doing anything dangerous. Speaking of PB crisps, can they sacrifice Mr. Peanut to bring back PB

693
02:21:11,780 --> 02:21:18,440
crisps? Is that what this whole thing is for? This is going to... All right, here's my prediction.

694
02:21:18,440 --> 02:21:24,360
Super Bowl ad PB crisps is coming back and this was just a big thing for him to reveal that PB

695
02:21:24,360 --> 02:21:30,120
crisps are returning is not really dead. This is a big marketing ploy to bring back PB crisps,

696
02:21:30,120 --> 02:21:40,229
the only product that anyone buys from planters that ever did buy. And I have a theory that the

697
02:21:40,229 --> 02:21:43,989
reason why they discontinued him and they're like, oh, maybe one day we'll bring him back.

698
02:21:43,989 --> 02:21:50,809
No, they were delicious. What were they made out of? What's the big secret as to why everyone

699
02:21:50,809 --> 02:21:57,959
wants them? Everyone loves those things. Why'd they get rid of them? Yeah, everyone loves PB

700
02:21:57,959 --> 02:22:07,899
crisps. Yummy peanut cream in the middle. What chemical was in there? I'm saying like, what?

701
02:22:07,899 --> 02:22:11,819
Why won't they bring them back? Ah, shit, we can't bring back the original recipe.

702
02:22:12,700 --> 02:22:30,680
They were good though. These things are so awesome. I used to, in my mouth, I would separate the outer

703
02:22:30,680 --> 02:22:36,040
shell of the crisp and separate the inside peanut butter, eat the shell first, and then I would eat

704
02:22:36,040 --> 02:22:39,559
the peanut butter in the middle afterwards. You all did it and it was the best thing you've ever done.

705
02:22:40,520 --> 02:22:50,489
Or I would peel the shell around it, eat it, and then take that solid creamy peanut butter

706
02:22:50,489 --> 02:23:08,600
and put it in, eat it. I actually have to go. So you're fucked up. No, that these are coming

707
02:23:08,600 --> 02:23:12,920
from the people that told me that they eat Reese's. They like stick their tongue through the middle,

708
02:23:13,639 --> 02:23:18,600
push up, smear out the peanut butter, and then put it into their hand and eat it and then break

709
02:23:18,600 --> 02:23:22,600
the ring in half. I told you guys that I eat Reese's just normally, and it was like, what?

710
02:23:23,319 --> 02:23:32,979
But you're a serial killer. Like I, in Oreos, I talked about Oreos. I eat Oreos just normally.

711
02:23:32,979 --> 02:23:38,180
I dunk them in milk and I just eat them. But you don't twist them and like rub your feet on them

712
02:23:38,180 --> 02:23:58,780
and then sit on them and then blow your nose on it and then eat it? No, I don't. I thought you said

713
02:23:58,780 --> 02:24:09,510
you dunked Reese's in milk. No, I dunked cookies in milk. I have another, uh, just sell it, whatever.

714
02:24:09,510 --> 02:24:20,379
I'm gonna gamble. I know it's pronounced Reese's, but Reese's is how I say it. Reese's

715
02:24:21,020 --> 02:24:26,139
with different countries, different dialects, you know, like Reese's. That's how we say it here.

716
02:24:27,659 --> 02:24:43,350
A flawed skull in here. I have these greater health potions. All right, I'm just gonna sell it. I

717
02:24:43,350 --> 02:24:52,700
don't want it. I haven't repaired in a long time. I want sweets so bad right now. I don't blame you.

718
02:24:52,700 --> 02:25:18,250
They're really delicious. I don't blame you. Bagged milk, yes or no? Um, I don't, I don't know.

719
02:25:18,250 --> 02:25:35,879
All right, here we go. You know what I'm about to do with this. Buy and be reborn. I can't,

720
02:25:35,879 --> 02:25:51,819
it's not made out of milk. I'll figure out what to do with it. How do I speed up a stream? Um,

721
02:25:52,780 --> 02:25:57,899
you leave the stream, you go to sleep, go take like a two-hour nap and come back to your chair.

722
02:25:58,700 --> 02:26:14,340
That should do it. You need to go faster. You can't, there is no such thing as going

723
02:26:14,420 --> 02:26:23,270
faster in an ARPG. You got to take it slow and steady. We're not trying to win any race,

724
02:26:24,540 --> 02:26:34,979
just trying to continue. Wait, that was the right way, wasn't it? I'll get a pizza instead.

725
02:26:35,540 --> 02:26:47,940
Isn't it up this way? God damn it, I need potions. Go back, go back, go back, go back, go back. I'm

726
02:26:47,940 --> 02:27:04,299
going to buy stamina potions. Oh, cat, I'm not going to answer that question.

727
02:27:05,420 --> 02:27:21,959
I'm going to just, I'm going to damn you. Did I, I thought I was there? Apparently not.

728
02:27:22,840 --> 02:27:40,790
I need to know if I beat your record. Um, no, we, I, I used to bring the computer into the bathroom.

729
02:27:45,559 --> 02:27:51,159
I used to bring either a laptop, I would bring my whole computer into the bathroom. A lot of

730
02:27:51,159 --> 02:27:57,319
long-term viewers know this. When I was younger, I, I wanted to play so bad and just chill and

731
02:27:57,319 --> 02:28:02,600
relax. So I would bring my entire computer into the bathroom, plug it in and shit and sit on the

732
02:28:02,600 --> 02:28:09,000
toilet and have a little desk, a little card table. And I would sit there for like two hours.

733
02:28:09,959 --> 02:28:31,799
There we go. And it would be so irritating because after I was done, I had to take it all apart and

734
02:28:31,879 --> 02:28:44,520
put it all back where it was supposed to be. And it was the biggest pain in the ass. Can you imagine

735
02:28:44,520 --> 02:28:51,420
being my parents? As I didn't have headphones, I had like little speakers. Can you imagine being

736
02:28:51,420 --> 02:29:02,629
my parents and knowing that your son was in the bathroom and you hear a battle scenario? This is

737
02:29:02,629 --> 02:29:14,709
what you listen to. What you're hearing right now. Can you come back every 20 minutes and still hear

738
02:29:14,709 --> 02:29:30,229
this? Like, what is he doing? I need the, uh, curious, the sewers under the curious as are.

739
02:29:31,030 --> 02:29:48,540
There's also a skill book here or a stat book. He must have eaten something funny.

740
02:29:52,180 --> 02:30:04,649
Well, I don't know. My, you cooked it. Now imagine if I had the opportunity to be playing online

741
02:30:05,610 --> 02:30:15,219
with a mic in there. You just hear that toilet flush sound. You couldn't mute microphones back

742
02:30:15,219 --> 02:30:27,180
then. And people still don't even mute their mics anymore. I, you think that's some kind of issue.

743
02:30:27,180 --> 02:30:40,500
How many times have you heard somebody's ceiling fan? Somebody comes into a lobby with their

744
02:30:40,500 --> 02:30:42,340
gain up to a hundred percent. And it's just like,

745
02:30:58,940 --> 02:31:05,819
it's a huge, just ear piercing, blow out the microphone a hundred percent and gain

746
02:31:05,819 --> 02:31:11,510
cough into the microphone. And it's like, Oh, and you rip the headset off. It's like,

747
02:31:11,510 --> 02:31:57,530
it sounds like they're just walking over shattered glass in your ears. I think it's

748
02:31:57,530 --> 02:32:23,000
up here. Taco bell has potato chips. Taco bell has nachos. Ooh. I mean, they have corn chips,

749
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:37,530
right? I'm gonna be mad at me for not opening chests. I'm doing it for that guy.

750
02:32:39,180 --> 02:32:46,709
All right. Here we go. The bazaar. I need to find the last piece of the puzzle here.

751
02:32:48,280 --> 02:32:50,440
All right. Yeah. And then after this level up, we're going to do a tier list.

752
02:32:59,829 --> 02:33:07,450
We're looking for the sewers, sewers. Aren't there like six of these? Why am I saying it

753
02:33:07,450 --> 02:33:17,450
like this with all the S's? Sewers. It's in the sewers. It's inside the sewers. Fuck. Now

754
02:33:17,450 --> 02:33:33,719
that sounds weird. This used to be a tier, this used to be a tier list stream. The S's are,

755
02:33:34,520 --> 02:33:46,940
I don't like the letter S anymore. All right. What's it like being the number one Diablo

756
02:33:46,940 --> 02:33:53,739
2 streamer on Twitch? Well, real easy when you play games that nobody plays.

757
02:34:03,059 --> 02:34:22,729
It's real easy to be number one when the closest number next to you is zero. Wacky,

758
02:34:22,729 --> 02:34:43,190
wacky comedy stream. Is this sewers? You should stream more Hearthstone. No, this is not the sewer.

759
02:34:46,120 --> 02:34:58,139
No, no, no, no. Not the sewer. Look at all this crap. Yeah. And what have a patch they last did,

760
02:34:58,139 --> 02:35:04,459
like two years, three years ago to this game, whatever it was, they had, they upped the potion

761
02:35:04,459 --> 02:35:09,989
drops. It was holy shit. I've never seen this before. Even with the max players and shit.

762
02:35:10,870 --> 02:35:19,620
I used to do lobbies with eight people. There are other Diablo 2 streamers. I thought you said I

763
02:35:19,620 --> 02:35:36,340
was the only one. Never. No, I've never played hardcore before. Doors. I said you were number

764
02:35:36,340 --> 02:35:50,170
one. Oh, I thought you said that I was the only one. Like I'm the only one. Hey sewers, you got it.

765
02:35:55,940 --> 02:36:02,760
Look at the ego on this guy. Level two. Playing barbarian here was really fun because they had

766
02:36:02,760 --> 02:36:06,500
leap. You could just jump over around and everything. It's cool. One of the first

767
02:36:06,500 --> 02:36:11,850
experiences I ever had with this game was a childhood friend of mine was in the sewers part

768
02:36:11,850 --> 02:36:14,889
here and they would just do leap as barbarian. I thought it was the coolest thing I've ever seen.

769
02:36:16,090 --> 02:36:26,600
Hey, new viewer here. Are you the shpee guy?

770
02:36:29,239 --> 02:36:41,540
Weird to be a new viewer when Jerma is in your name. Hey dude, new viewer. I've like been on

771
02:36:41,540 --> 02:37:05,590
Twitch just like browsing around and your name is in my name. Coincidence. It's weird. Also Jerma.

772
02:37:05,590 --> 02:37:26,020
Maybe. It'd be weird. So are you the shpee guy or no? No. I gave that up a long time ago.

773
02:37:38,940 --> 02:38:04,389
Mace. Stay healthy. Stay healthy. Stay healthy. Is this a hardcore thing? Is that what it is?

774
02:38:09,159 --> 02:38:31,799
Yes. Level two. Is this some kind of hardcore thing? I mean.

775
02:38:54,059 --> 02:39:14,309
There's a head jump. I'm killed. I think I got Vic here. Resident sleeper. Where's the commentary?

776
02:39:15,270 --> 02:39:25,879
People are fucking trying to sleep. Oh green green green green. I think it's the same one I have.

777
02:39:26,520 --> 02:39:32,549
Berserkers. Oh do I have any Berserkers?

778
02:39:35,510 --> 02:39:49,670
Not a skeleton. Why are people trying to sleep? What am I saying? People are trying to fucking sleep.

779
02:39:50,790 --> 02:40:00,250
Um this is kind of better. That's fire resist though. I know who would wear this. No Berserkers

780
02:40:00,250 --> 02:40:09,979
again. He's got 75 fire resistance. That guy's ready to go. Nancy Drew napping room.

781
02:40:18,780 --> 02:40:35,620
Key filter waiting room. Not that way. I just want to get off work. I'm playing uh

782
02:40:36,420 --> 02:40:47,670
Necro dude. It's really fucking odd. What are you gonna do? A bathtub stream.

783
02:40:49,909 --> 02:40:53,340
Let's turn my camera on right now until it's time to go to the bathroom.

784
02:40:53,340 --> 02:41:08,579
We get some hogs in the chat to wake up these these I was gonna say I was gonna say idiots

785
02:41:08,579 --> 02:41:24,809
but if you're you know if you're tired you're not an idiot you're just tired almost time for

786
02:41:24,809 --> 02:41:29,930
a level up which means almost time for a tier list a tier list you said it all right I'm getting up

787
02:41:33,819 --> 02:41:46,409
hey I just shook the bag of dog treats what what's that oh yeah okay I'm ready shit

788
02:41:48,010 --> 02:42:03,020
it's starting to get dangerous I really do need to find I might have to do some endarial runs

789
02:42:03,020 --> 02:42:10,459
after this before I go to Mephisto I think I have to do a couple of endarial runs I mean

790
02:42:10,459 --> 02:42:20,889
I'm kind of getting beat up if I get hit once it's like ow remember you promised me she's

sewers are so huge don't run that far without I don't have anything to do

Leem's heart it's a gem shrine a gem shrine just automatically upgrades any gem in your inventory

832
02:53:10,680 --> 02:53:15,000
to the next tier so I could have brought a regular gem here and it would have been

833
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:24,360
upgraded to a flawless gem and that's when I cry what we got first for Kaleem's flail and

834
02:53:24,360 --> 02:53:36,860
in provincial beware of the high council Leem's heart and it still bears the courage to face

835

Mephisto place it in the horodric cube along with Kaleem's other relics the eye the brain

it has to be the number one thing that's like on every wiki like why can't it be I'd rather

891
03:08:43,540 --> 03:08:48,809
be this one I mean at least this one's like a joke this is me scary looking into a camera

892
03:08:49,450 --> 03:08:54,250
like I'm like I'm I'm coming and I'm fucking mad I this one's a joke you know what I mean

893
03:08:58,489 --> 03:09:09,860

897
03:09:56,360 --> 03:10:08,020
there's a lot of d faces here mustache hair has to be up kind of high

uh like a twitter picture I took one time this one's all right I'll just do some refinement

899
03:10:16,899 --> 03:10:23,049

900
03:10:23,049 --> 03:11:02,809
face it's it's it's my favorite image could be could be accurate it's accurate okay it's real

901
03:11:02,809 --> 03:11:11,129
um just that there's a story behind this one there's a story behind all of these this one I

902
03:11:11,129 --> 03:11:18,500
think has there's so much going on in this one because the circumstance all right let's get down

903
03:11:18,500 --> 03:11:31,799
here um it's I like it but it's old you know these are these are new what even what's this

904
03:11:31,799 --> 03:11:39,530
even from what is this this looks like it's not taken from here this is taken from some

905
03:11:39,530 --> 03:11:54,899
other place from where is it the green screen the awards ah okay the awards all right it's

906
03:11:54,899 --> 03:12:12,840
pretty good this one's so stupid is the clown better than all these though you don't even

907
03:12:12,840 --> 03:12:18,659
look at itchy ear like inside your ear and I can't reach that far I want to take like

908
03:12:18,659 --> 03:12:28,700
a little device and go in and just like scratch but that's so bad for you it's like no you don't

909
03:12:28,700 --> 03:12:32,600
you're not supposed you're not supposed to put q-tips in your ears you're really not well

910
03:12:32,600 --> 03:12:37,000
everybody does it's funny we all say that to each other now I don't put q-tips in your ears

911
03:12:37,000 --> 03:12:44,219
yes everyone every single person does it everyone says don't do it but all of us do it why why why

912
03:12:44,219 --> 03:12:53,399
can't we just come clean about that no don't fucking do that not good for you did it this

913
03:12:53,399 --> 03:13:39,979
morning I'm working on it I'm working what's the worst the worst possible face is probably this one

914
03:13:39,979 --> 03:13:55,530
it's just not it's just me these two no it's this one yeah what's the best all right this

915
03:13:55,530 --> 03:14:04,139
one's really bad too so is this one so is this one so is this one it's probably these are probably

916
03:14:04,139 --> 03:14:21,290
the best so is this one now these belong together because they're just like screen there's just

917
03:14:21,290 --> 03:14:28,549
screen caps from a youtube video I wasn't making any faces here I wasn't trying to be funny or do

918
03:14:28,549 --> 03:14:37,959
a joke this is just you took a screen cap from two different videos from like 2012 oh yeah that's

919
03:14:37,959 --> 03:15:12,729
bad put these two together I could you could say the same thing it's funny when you can tell when

920
03:15:12,889 --> 03:15:30,790
from the same stream was it this bad one day was it this fucked up one day what was going on on

921
03:15:30,790 --> 03:15:46,840
this stream these could all be the same day all right that's accurate this is yeah this is accurate

922
03:15:46,840 --> 03:15:58,489
because you have four shirts that way this green one all the time is it is the green one in any

923
03:15:58,489 --> 03:16:12,340
of these thank god there you go there's there's me raiding my own face not a narcissist by the

924
03:16:12,340 --> 03:16:28,569
way not an egomaniac by the way the joker face is too low are you sure the joker face is better

925
03:16:28,569 --> 03:16:43,479
than mustache hair or scrunched mcchicken face yeah actually yeah actually it is actually it is

926
03:16:43,479 --> 03:16:50,500

i take i'm a bath hobbyist we talked about my hobbies i'm taking baths as a hobby can i put

938
03:19:11,129 --> 03:19:22,809
that up here i take i take a bath like three times a week i'm not making that up i swear to god

939
03:19:24,280 --> 03:19:50,149
i love it and then i go like under the water and i just go not bad true gamer all right what this

940
03:19:50,149 --> 03:19:57,860
is from a river no you're gonna get like a tapeworm it's probably safer to drink toilet water than it

941
03:19:57,860 --> 03:20:11,000
is to drink water right out of a river you're gonna get like this is i don't know i know that's

942
03:20:11,000 --> 03:20:17,020
actually true if you you could there's like all kinds of bacteria and contaminated this is

943
03:20:17,020 --> 03:20:24,229
regulated i mean as long as nobody's shipping it yeah i would probably i don't know that's tricky

944
03:20:24,229 --> 03:20:32,809
where's smart water i don't know it's not on here what happened to diablo we're going back to it

945
03:20:32,809 --> 03:20:39,690
we got caught up what is domino diamond water not even close to being fiji i don't even know

946
03:20:39,690 --> 03:20:45,670
what it is all right let's put the antifreeze over here all right what's safer drinking antifreeze

947
03:20:45,670 --> 03:21:04,069
or drinking water out of a river river water is safer than of course it is i don't even know

948
03:21:04,069 --> 03:21:08,469
what these are i don't i'm just gonna put them over on d d is like i don't d is don't care

949
03:21:08,469 --> 03:21:16,889
d is don't care because i've never had it drinking water from a pool but all right hold on drinking

950
03:21:16,889 --> 03:21:29,579
water tier list you don't drink water from a pool there's two things going on here all right

951
03:21:29,579 --> 03:21:43,739
drinking water from a pool versus drinking water from a toilet the it the toilet's probably safer

952
03:21:43,739 --> 03:21:52,629
uh is this a pool that is this a pool that just got shocked or chlorinated all right yeah so it's

953
03:21:52,629 --> 03:21:56,729
it's safer to drink out of a toilet than out of a pool and we're not talking about oh you got a

954
03:21:56,729 --> 03:21:59,610
little bit up your nose or you got a little bit in your mouth you know we're talking about like a

955
03:21:59,610 --> 03:22:05,700
we got like a full 16 ounce glass of water right drinking like a full like 24 ounce glass like

956
03:22:05,700 --> 03:22:11,430
downing it on the pool right so that's i would i don't know if i would do that but i would you

957
03:22:11,430 --> 03:22:15,030
know what i'd probably do that before drinking water over a toilet this is just too much to bear

958
03:22:15,030 --> 03:22:22,069
i would do a full like 16 ounce glass of water from a pool then i would have 16 ounces from a

959
03:22:22,069 --> 03:22:26,709
toilet but i would do toilet before i did like a random river that could have like e coli in it

960
03:22:26,709 --> 03:22:32,739
and i would do river after before doing drinking any freeze so okay out of the ocean you don't

961
03:22:32,739 --> 03:22:37,459
want to do that either out of a lake you don't want to do that either and then i don't know

962
03:22:37,459 --> 03:22:49,930
what this is drink water from this is much safer than than this drinking water out of a lake is

963
03:22:49,930 --> 03:22:58,629
probably wouldn't because the salt water salt water versus freshwater they're both bad river

964
03:22:58,629 --> 03:23:10,360
yeah what no no no standing water that's even worse i would drink a full glass out of a sea

965
03:23:10,360 --> 03:23:16,440
then a full glass out of a pool then a full glass out of a toilet then a full glass out of a river

966
03:23:17,180 --> 03:23:21,610
running water it's moving standing water is mosquitoes and i don't want to drink mosquito

967
03:23:21,610 --> 03:23:33,610
eggs and then any freeze you would die if i drank 16 ounces of salt water i'm gonna die

968
03:23:33,610 --> 03:23:40,389
uh sorry guys i i used to drink gatorade out of the just for no reason the same thing i would die

969
03:23:40,389 --> 03:23:47,020
if i drank 16 ounces what is this the only water i get to have ever why is this the only water i

970
03:23:47,020 --> 03:24:01,209
get to drink why is if i drink 16 ounces of water you're not gonna hydrate but it's going to kill

971
03:24:01,209 --> 03:24:21,049
you if you if i drink 16 ounce glass of water from the ocean i die i'm going to die but what

972
03:24:21,049 --> 03:24:30,120
if i drank 16 ounces of ocean water and then a fucking full like disani right what happens

973
03:24:30,120 --> 03:24:45,399
they will negate each other but this is like what are the circumstances we didn't go over the

974
03:24:45,399 --> 03:24:52,280
circumstances we didn't go over the rules am i like trapped on an island am i the only person

975
03:24:52,280 --> 03:24:58,549
at the pool am i the only one using the toilet am i what there are no ground rules here we haven't

976
03:24:58,549 --> 03:25:10,700
made them i'm not drinking salt water to hydrate i just is it safer to drink 16 ounces of salt water

977
03:25:10,700 --> 03:25:18,500
or 16 ounces of water from a chlorinated shocked fucking pool they're both dangerous but which one

978
03:25:18,979 --> 03:25:35,530
which one is worse pool is safer you know how much pool water i've gotten in my eyes and in my nose

979
03:25:35,530 --> 03:25:48,920
and in my mouth i've drank probably four or five glasses of this water before and i'm all right no

980
03:25:48,920 --> 03:25:57,540
i don't believe it this is the worst thing you can drink because there's mosquito eggs in like this

981
03:25:57,540 --> 03:26:04,709
standing water standing lake water you just that's you could actually actually die this you're saying

982
03:26:04,709 --> 03:26:09,989
it just it dehydrates you but if i'm not stranded on an island i would be safer drinking this and

983
03:26:10,069 --> 03:26:17,530
then just drinking a glass of water and maybe like eating some bread or something the salt water

984
03:26:17,530 --> 03:26:43,000
kills all the germs all right all right any that's done it's over it's over arrowhead arrowheads are

985
03:26:43,000 --> 03:26:49,219
not better than evian and evian's not better than fiji and i love taking baths so that's this is

986
03:26:49,219 --> 03:27:05,430
accurate i'm not drinking this you guys really gonna make me do this fine it's safer to drink

987
03:27:05,430 --> 03:27:11,780
water out of your bathtub than any of these other things because who cares it's just a bathtub

988
03:27:11,780 --> 03:27:17,219
there's nobody shits in their bathtub nobody pisses in their bathtub i like taking baths

989
03:27:17,219 --> 03:27:39,290
it's not fair everyone pees in their bathtub so let's get this straight when i tell you that

990
03:27:39,290 --> 03:27:44,469
i've peed in the shower before which to pee directly into a drain and you don't have to sit

991
03:27:44,469 --> 03:27:50,260
in it that's weird but all of you guys are saying that you've pissed in your bathtub before where

992
03:27:50,260 --> 03:28:00,489
you have to sit in your fucking bathtub and be surrounded by urine but you're not weird you're

993
03:28:00,489 --> 03:28:18,739
you're not weird i'm weird if you pee directly into the drain if you pee directly into the drain

994
03:28:18,739 --> 03:28:34,950
what's the difference yeah i just i need i want to know the difference what's the difference

995
03:28:34,950 --> 03:28:39,450
after you take the bath you pee you're just sitting in a bath what are you talking about

996
03:28:39,450 --> 03:29:04,379
this is done accurate you stand up and do it i'm never going to your house you put like the two or

997
03:29:04,379 --> 03:29:07,340
three towels out for me and you put it on the bathtub and you just hang them over there and

998
03:29:07,340 --> 03:29:17,129
you're like yeah you got a bathtub i'm not i'm not going in that bathtub bathtub is kind of just a

999
03:29:17,129 --> 03:29:36,219
big urinal though i guess i get it i get it what's the next one i already did this one before i'm

1000
03:29:36,219 --> 03:29:59,379
gonna do it real quick who gets the coffee from all these places all right so this is what's your

1001
03:29:59,379 --> 03:30:23,290
favorite coffee just kidding where do you like what's your favorite fast food restaurant is

1002
03:30:23,290 --> 03:30:32,260
influencing all right that was fun what's this one all right i want i want to do this one i want to

1003
03:30:32,260 --> 03:30:41,930
do this one and then we're going back to diablo this is jim carrey movie the mask number one

03:30:41,930 --> 03:30:52,889
all right jim carrey movies we've got ace ventura get up there where ace ventura uh two wait no no

1005
03:30:52,889 --> 03:31:00,889

1011
03:31:53,340 --> 03:32:04,379
penguins didn't see it me myself and irene i mean it's a classic cable guy it's classic the majestic

1012
03:32:04,379 --> 03:32:17,319
the one with the other movie the movie theater one yes man the dumb and dumbers are backwards

1013
03:32:19,030 --> 03:32:33,420
oh yeah you're right batman forever s uh i didn't see this one i didn't see this one i didn't see

1014
03:32:33,500 --> 03:32:39,850
this one i didn't see this one christmas carol it's all right sonic the hedgehog movie we nobody's

1015
03:32:39,850 --> 03:32:50,250
seen it yet i haven't seen this one i don't know vermin show get up there man of the moon get up

1016
03:32:50,250 --> 03:33:01,290
there grinch it's all right i don't know oh no this uh fun with uh i didn't see it i didn't see

1017
03:33:01,290 --> 03:33:08,579
this one i don't even know what this one is i don't know this one is uh i don't know this one is uh

1018
03:33:08,579 --> 03:33:16,229
oh this is okay i don't know this one is i don't know this one is i don't know what this one is

1019
03:33:16,229 --> 03:33:23,899
all right let's get this right oh wait that was eternal sunshine where's where's eternal

1020
03:33:23,899 --> 03:33:40,549
where's eternal sunshine which one is it this one okay that's an accurate s tier

1021
03:33:40,549 --> 03:33:55,530
for jim carrey movies why would i put eternal sunshine next to the mask that's that's so far

1022
03:33:55,530 --> 03:34:01,959
below it that's better that's i mean that's that's inaccurate the mask is the best movie

1023
03:34:01,959 --> 03:34:19,940
that he's ever done it was incredible that everything we're gonna have to bump something

1024
03:34:19,940 --> 03:34:33,000
off i think no liar liar was good but i don't know if it was cable guy good the grinch goes

1025
03:34:33,000 --> 03:34:37,590
up no the grinch was like two hours too long you shaved like three and a half hours off that movie

1026
03:34:37,590 --> 03:35:09,260
and i would i would agree uh i like bruce almighty more than eternal sunshine what's the worst jim

1027
03:35:09,260 --> 03:35:30,440
carrey movie that i've seen i mean they're both not very good the grinch feels like it was a day

1028
03:35:30,440 --> 03:35:35,479
long yes that's what happens when you take an old fun children's story that was 12 minutes long and

1029
03:35:35,479 --> 03:35:54,100
you make it like a four and a half hour long movie remember that these are i just haven't seen these

1030
03:35:54,100 --> 03:36:01,139
so if you're like oh dark dark crimes that's great i just haven't seen it the upload two is in the

1031
03:36:01,139 --> 03:36:15,370
background it is that movie's an hour and 32 minutes thanks for proving my point that we all

1032
03:36:15,370 --> 03:36:19,989
of us thought we all thought it was like three and a half hours long again it was like three

1033
03:36:19,989 --> 03:36:35,420
hours too long great performance though it goes up fantastic performance by jim carrey preemptively

1034
03:36:35,420 --> 03:36:42,219
rate sonic s tier that's a safe bet i'm not sure that's a safe bet i would probably assume that

1035
03:36:42,219 --> 03:36:53,139
this is going to be up here somewhere though is is his dr egg man performance going to be as good

1036
03:36:53,139 --> 03:37:04,889
as his yes man performance that's to be seen yes man sucked well why do you think it's right

1037
03:37:04,889 --> 03:37:19,000
next to burt wonderstone i don't know maybe we'll see we'll see if it's a fun it's a fun

1038
03:37:19,000 --> 03:37:29,770
movie it could be fun it's one of the first jim carrey comedy kind of he's going back to comedy

1039
03:37:29,770 --> 03:37:33,850
it's been a while well dumb and dumber two was the last time he did he was in like a comedy movie

1040
03:37:33,930 --> 03:37:48,420
right in like three or four years and before that it was a while too six years remember the bad

1041
03:37:48,420 --> 03:37:54,659
taste in movies joke is getting old if you think that this belongs somewhere else besides s if you

1042
03:37:54,659 --> 03:38:02,139
think these three belong somewhere else i'm not sure what i don't know how to how to explain to

1043
03:38:02,139 --> 03:38:14,059
you these things this is like the required reading for jim carrey movies a s and a tier is required

1044
03:38:14,059 --> 03:38:24,860
jim carrey reading he almost got a academy award for this he got like a golden globe for man on

1045
03:38:24,860 --> 03:38:37,879
the moon it was great ace pentura is overrated i don't know i mean like the second one's the

1046
03:38:37,879 --> 03:38:48,729
first one is i like the second one better than the first one and eternal sunshine was i mean

1047
03:38:48,729 --> 03:38:53,770
whatever it's all right it's good he doesn't mean a bad movie he just means it's not it's not the

1048
03:38:53,770 --> 03:39:14,020
truman show there's your list and now let's do adam sam you don't mess with the zohan

1049
03:39:14,739 --> 03:39:27,590
happy gilmore s tier i saw this movie in the theaters me and burger boy saw this because we

1050
03:39:27,590 --> 03:39:31,590
were like oh this has to be like the worst movie ever and we it was hard for us to not get up and

1051
03:39:31,590 --> 03:39:37,530
leave we were just like let's go fucking watch this shitty movie and it was hard to say stay

1052
03:39:37,530 --> 03:39:44,899
and watch the whole thing the the only good part about that movie is the al pacino duncacino song

1053
03:39:45,909 --> 03:39:50,979
that's it so i don't go don't go don't i mean that's the only thing that was worth watching in the

1054
03:39:50,979 --> 03:39:56,459
whole movie the ad and it was just giant product placement i don't even care it was it was so

1055
03:39:56,459 --> 03:40:06,899
stupid don caccino is the only reason why that movie was even tolerable oh the gobbler no the

1056
03:40:06,899 --> 03:40:15,079
cobbler haven't seen it d is haven't seen it f is just like why if the first dates didn't see it i

1057
03:40:15,079 --> 03:40:22,360
didn't have a reason to see it oh this is this is a boston movie someone was like fucking talking

1058
03:40:22,360 --> 03:40:26,040
like fucking this all the fucking time this is a boston movie so it has to be at sea for me

1059
03:40:29,260 --> 03:40:40,629
um wedding singer was all right but i'm i really did i'm not like a huge wedding singer fan why is

1060
03:40:40,629 --> 03:41:04,309
hotel transylvania on here but not with eight crazy nights where is it all right i think this

1061
03:41:04,309 --> 03:41:24,139
is good big daddy better than uh yeah there we go that's accurate no uncut gems that movie just

1062
03:41:24,139 --> 03:41:35,989
came out like three months ago i didn't see this it's supposed to be kind of good i didn't see it

1063
03:41:38,299 --> 03:41:45,100
nothing comes close to happy gilmore no nothing does i would say the difference between the this

1064
03:41:45,100 --> 03:42:01,079
s tier and this a tier is probably it's probably like 60 feet probably like 70 feet actually that's

1065
03:42:01,079 --> 03:42:27,209
no that's great that's better zohan is beyond s tier all right let's go back to diablo 2

1066
03:42:28,600 --> 03:42:38,649
they're your tier list tier list hotel is not f tier no i hotel okay wait wait i didn't see that

1067
03:42:38,809 --> 03:42:44,489
okay i didn't see hotel transylvania i got upset that it was the only animated one on here um i

1068
03:42:44,489 --> 03:42:55,850
didn't i didn't see this i didn't you want me to put pixels anywhere besides f all right let's go

1069
03:42:55,850 --> 03:47:35,799
that's fun now i gotta pee so let's take the first break i'll be right back okay they're returned

1070
03:47:35,799 --> 03:47:59,700

1079
03:50:36,780 --> 03:50:45,959
spring but kim hates it so anytime that i would want to use it kim is like no no do not

1080
03:50:45,959 --> 03:51:03,420
oh i don't use it anymore all right my weapon is broken it's all right i don't need to go back

1081
03:51:04,139 --> 03:51:06,440
it smells like chemicals

1082
03:51:17,590 --> 03:51:26,790
it does have a sort of a chemical smell it has a green chemical smell all right i need to get the

1083
03:51:26,790 --> 03:51:32,440
flail and prevention i gotta move actually i have this as long as i use it

1084
03:51:35,700 --> 03:51:38,340
don't go that fast don't go that fast it's seriously i don't have a weapon

1085
03:51:38,340 --> 03:51:48,329
and i'm in hardcore i forget that sometimes no i get off everything is made out of chemicals

1086
03:51:49,829 --> 03:51:58,250
yeah who repairs an act three it's still after yes we're getting to the end of act three

1087
03:51:58,250 --> 03:52:03,610
greeting we'll be at the end of act three after i get the flail we'll then be going to the durance

1088
03:52:03,610 --> 03:52:14,489
of hate and then be doing the most farmable thing in the game it used to be pinwheel not what's his

1089
03:52:14,489 --> 03:52:19,930
what's his name they nerfed him because it was so easy and what was it what was his name what's his

1090
03:52:19,930 --> 03:52:33,000
name his name is pendle or something right greetings here good day indel skin yeah you

1091
03:52:33,000 --> 03:52:41,079
used to be able to uh so there was this little mini boss in diablo 2 it was pendle skin uh he

1092
03:52:41,079 --> 03:52:47,420
was right next to the waypoint and you could kill him in one hit and he dropped in an amazing

1093
03:52:47,420 --> 03:52:52,700
drop table he had the same drop table as bosses so you would just remake a game kill him in one

1094
03:52:52,700 --> 03:52:56,299
second loot remake the game kill him in one second loot over and over again hundreds and hundreds of

1095
03:52:56,299 --> 03:53:10,299
times and then they nerfed it because it was way too easy to get anything and then i think that

1096
03:53:10,299 --> 03:53:26,819
they also nerfed mephisto too didn't they a long time ago they nerfed an easy to kill character

1097
03:53:26,819 --> 03:53:30,260
well they'd nerfed his loot table they made it so you didn't drop this thing

1098
03:53:32,659 --> 03:53:36,180
because i mean at some point people are just making in your battle net lobbies

1099
03:53:36,180 --> 03:53:44,100
a new game every five seconds or every 12 like 10 seconds to kill the same enemy and that's what

1100
03:53:44,100 --> 03:53:49,219
every single person is doing that's logged in at some point you look at that and go uh this is

1101
03:53:49,219 --> 03:53:58,600
kind of that's probably dumb we should probably do something about that do i eat mcdonald's it's

1102
03:53:58,600 --> 03:54:06,139
like one of my favorite places yes in fact i may even eat mcdonald's later because he just said

1103
03:54:06,139 --> 03:54:16,700
that you've influenced me influencer how would i know didn't you get banned oh what the fuck's

1104
03:54:16,700 --> 03:54:30,299
what happened that was weird what has happened huh yeah i lost chat too for like a second

1105
03:54:31,180 --> 03:54:37,139
it was like one tenth of a second almost hit travencel

1106
03:54:46,540 --> 03:54:58,500
yeah it was dead for a second this part is always such a pain in the ass but having

1107
03:54:59,059 --> 03:55:08,600
necromancer with summon is it's pretty great actually um do i like bath bombs yes i do but

1108
03:55:08,600 --> 03:55:16,600
one time probably two three months ago uh i did a bath bomb and i thought i had jaundice and i

1109
03:55:16,600 --> 03:55:24,489
freaked out and almost canceled the stream i was seconds away from canceling i think i actually did

1110
03:55:24,489 --> 03:55:28,329
cancel the stream i was like guys this is i gotta do something i gotta go i have to go to like the

1111
03:55:28,329 --> 03:55:54,950
doctor and i did like a mustard colored bath bomb and it stained my skin oh yeah almost went

1112
03:55:54,950 --> 03:56:00,250
to yeah we talked about it on the screen because we talked about if i had gone to the doctor

1113
03:56:00,889 --> 03:56:04,809
how horrible would that have been he would have been like what's wrong yeah i got i've got i've

1114
03:56:04,809 --> 03:56:08,569
got jaundice i'm not sure because we were talking about i've had i had like a liver scan and they

1115
03:56:08,569 --> 03:56:13,690
because remember when all these medical things were going on i had a liver scan so i'm sitting

1116
03:56:13,690 --> 03:56:21,450
there going uh-oh this is it this is it's my liver right as i go into the doctor and he takes

1117
03:56:21,450 --> 03:56:23,530
a napkin and just kind of wipes your skin

1118
03:56:26,569 --> 03:56:40,950
garamy what are you doing here uh the council can auto kill like you can automatically kill

1119
03:56:43,290 --> 03:56:48,329
have to be ready they sprint really fast and one of them has an insanely deadly move

1120
03:56:50,170 --> 03:57:02,680
you've got to be ready you're a hypochondriac yeah i that's what i'm saying it would have been

1121
03:57:02,680 --> 03:57:06,680
really really weird it would have been so hard to describe too it would have been like oh well

1122
03:57:06,680 --> 03:57:14,979
i have a liver scan coming up and i thought i had jaundice and i i don't i i should go

1123
03:57:14,979 --> 03:57:24,969
oh thanks all right we need to do a turban to waypoint usually pretty close usually

1124
03:57:25,530 --> 03:57:34,389
i'm gonna use that term pretty loosely because i am bad at this game you can see lots of fails

1125
03:57:34,389 --> 03:57:50,940
you're gonna see lots of triumph the council might get them no i don't think so if we come this far

1126
03:57:51,579 --> 03:57:59,610
i think it's gonna be something in act four that truly kills me if we've come so far i'm not sure

1127
03:57:59,610 --> 03:58:13,209
it's gonna be actually that doesn't act the ancients will get them yeah because i can't

1128
03:58:13,209 --> 03:58:19,450
leave that area i don't know it's going to be tricky i would be happy if i completed all the

1129
03:58:19,450 --> 03:58:29,209
normal on hardcore just because i've never done it before not that waypoint did i get it wait i

1130
03:58:29,209 --> 03:58:37,879
did get it didn't i it's right there any ftk news yes actually just had a meeting with the people

1131
03:58:37,879 --> 03:58:46,409
that are making it uh we are going to it's it's still being developed and it's going to be a lot

1132
03:58:46,409 --> 03:58:54,340
more we took all the feedback from everybody so it's gonna be a lot more it's not just gonna

1133
03:58:54,340 --> 03:59:00,020
be kind of random like hey leg let's go and i if you kill me kill me we're gonna be doing

1134
03:59:00,020 --> 03:59:08,700
lots of interesting things so it's not just gonna be a mess they just actually started working out

1135
03:59:08,700 --> 03:59:19,899
it again like as of tomorrow or like as of today and it's going to bleed into that server

1136
03:59:20,950 --> 03:59:25,430
after the next stream we're gonna do a couple of uh funds we're gonna do a couple of fun things

1137
03:59:25,430 --> 03:59:32,979
on stream and then that's going to turn into a 24 7 minecraft server at least for a little while

1138
03:59:35,610 --> 03:59:42,379
just for you guys to play on whoever wants to participate in that and i'm scared of doing

1139
03:59:47,770 --> 03:59:52,729
i cannot promise that that server will be available forever but i can tell you that

1140
03:59:52,729 --> 04:00:00,760
it will be available at least or i would assume a majority of 2020 all right here we go this is

1141
04:00:00,760 --> 04:00:06,040

imbued him's flail can destroy the compelling orb and reveal the way to mefisto place it

1163
04:04:26,899 --> 04:04:32,659
into the favorite scent okay it's gonna sound weird his heart is when you drive around the

1164
04:04:32,659 --> 04:04:41,399
back of a burger king then transmute them to carry out kalim's will ridding kurost of the council

1165
04:04:41,399 --> 04:04:52,120
of zakka room was essential that burger king exhaust is what i'm gonna call it

1166
04:05:06,600 --> 04:05:13,399
brands mute everything make kalim's will are spoilers that was called the eye brain the heart

1167
04:05:13,399 --> 04:05:22,389
in the flail kalim's will he can only use this the only thing that works to break

1168
04:05:23,110 --> 04:05:38,489
the orb to bring you to mefisto so we're making our way to the durance of hate let's sell some

1169
04:05:38,489 --> 04:05:47,159
shit diablo and bale have surely found the temple city by now they seek to free their brother

1170
04:05:47,159 --> 04:05:53,319
mefisto who was imprisoned by the haradrim in the temple my brothers will not die in vain

1171
04:05:54,280 --> 04:05:59,000
sorry i can do that better and prevent them from releasing hatred upon the world

1172
04:06:03,780 --> 04:06:27,739
my brothers will not die in vain one of my favorite lines bash the orb dude was that

1173
04:06:27,739 --> 04:06:42,090
what was that was was that was stuff speaking can we get a bugleberry emote uh the idea is

1174
04:06:42,090 --> 04:06:52,420
maybe to have like a 50 slot bugleberry yeah we're all out of here who's with me

1175
04:06:53,219 --> 04:07:09,129
oh me me me me all right let's go birds of hate level one search for mefisto in the durance of

1176
04:07:09,129 --> 04:07:24,489
hate when we find two i've got to find the uh waypoint mefisto right hopefully i don't

1177
04:07:24,489 --> 04:07:47,350

1178
04:07:47,350 --> 04:07:53,290
and have it pop up right here that'd be great earns of hate level two come on it's been a while

1179
04:07:53,290 --> 04:08:00,309
since i've been in here so you know these memories are coming back this door runs for better gear

1180
04:08:00,870 --> 04:08:13,110
yeah what was the orange thing was a rune socket runes and if you do let's say you have a three

1181
04:08:13,110 --> 04:08:18,790
four five or six socket piece of gear there are words you can spell with the runes that make a

1182
04:08:18,790 --> 04:08:26,979
unique item something that they did not have in diablo 3 i don't i don't really know why

1183
04:08:27,540 --> 04:08:31,379
because people really liked it people thought it was one of the best parts about this game was

1184
04:08:31,379 --> 04:08:37,299
collecting runes and making rune words i don't know why they got rid of it and we got fucking

1185
04:08:37,299 --> 04:09:05,450
lucky hey otto what are you doing the oh diablo mega low three yeah i i'm not a i'm not a major

1186
04:09:05,530 --> 04:09:07,530
gigantic fan of diablo 3

1187
04:09:09,989 --> 04:09:17,750
i did think diablo 3 was fun to play but i didn't think it was fun to continue to play

1188
04:09:24,139 --> 04:09:34,340
the part the original is diablo 3 was eh it was good it was okay

1189
04:09:34,819 --> 04:09:42,709
okay they had like the most uninspiring shitty item system the abilities were fun to use

1190
04:09:44,700 --> 04:09:51,180
combat was fun although it was sort of a little it was a little uh the word i'm gonna use here

1191
04:09:51,180 --> 04:09:58,389
is like nose bleeding you know what i mean i'm gonna get that it was just like you just kind

1192
04:09:58,389 --> 04:10:05,030
of sit back and just get noses bleeding while you just click the same button and just stand

1193
04:10:05,030 --> 04:10:09,319
into a hallway and go a thousand boring

1194
04:10:15,030 --> 04:10:35,420
you mean brains yeah it's a little nose bleeding all right be careful i could die here fire protect

1195
04:10:35,420 --> 04:10:51,110
me at all costs losing people the iron golem is still pretty good though it wasn't all right

1196
04:10:51,829 --> 04:11:03,319
there were like three enemies in all of act one it's just i'm an item person i like collecting

1197
04:11:03,319 --> 04:11:14,219
items there was no reason to do that in diablo 3 every legendary was the same like it just had

1198
04:11:14,219 --> 04:11:22,250
hundreds of stats up it was just that was it and i also would and i know when they greet

1199
04:11:22,250 --> 04:11:27,819
yourselves came out they approved that game a lot but there's only so many band-aids you can put on

1200
04:11:27,819 --> 04:11:35,850
something before um you know you have to go to the hospital one of the things i really didn't

1201
04:11:35,850 --> 04:11:47,219
like about diablo 3 was grinding for legendaries and then rerolling stats it added that rng on top

1202
04:11:47,219 --> 04:11:58,540
of rng on top of rng it just was it was just a madness you had to roll you to get the item

1203
04:11:58,540 --> 04:12:03,739
and see what it rolled and then you had to reroll something on that item to be better for what you

1204
04:12:03,739 --> 04:12:08,860
wanted it for and then after that roll there was another roll to see what it rolled as

1205
04:12:10,540 --> 04:12:14,459
it was roll roll roll roll roll roll did you get what did you get max now you didn't it

1206
04:12:14,459 --> 04:12:23,940
was a shitty roll on that roll oh sorry you were looking for a plus 15 to uh to to fireball you

1207
04:12:23,940 --> 04:12:32,200
got eight you got 11 i have to do it again i'm being like what the fuck am i doing this for

1208
04:12:37,239 --> 04:13:03,670
i'm good looking for that weight thing you only have one point and summon resist

1209
04:13:04,469 --> 04:13:29,909
hey we're okay this way i also like putting points in too i know that some of the argument

1210
04:13:29,909 --> 04:13:35,590
against okay you have to you could put 20 skill points in that but it doesn't matter because if

1211
04:13:35,590 --> 04:13:40,149
it just was based on your level anyways you'd see it grow you don't have to put it but i like

1212
04:13:40,229 --> 04:13:49,000
putting points in it's fun for me it's scratches and itch for me every single move you have in

1213
04:13:49,000 --> 04:13:53,719
this game can have 20 skill points put into it by you something about it is i like it well here

1214
04:13:53,719 --> 04:14:02,680
we go but i need the waypoint am i gonna play diablo 4 i don't know a diablo 4 really does seem

1215
04:14:02,680 --> 04:14:10,090
like they weren't really ready at all for it they saw all the backlash that diablo immortal had

1216
04:14:10,090 --> 04:14:13,450
and they may have been developing it but then they're just like all right dude we gotta fucking do

1217
04:14:13,450 --> 04:14:20,940
something because this is not even close like hey we're gonna announce diablo 3 it's not even

1218
04:14:20,940 --> 04:14:26,840
close you maybe you'll see it eventually over the next few like three or four years i don't even

1219
04:14:26,840 --> 04:14:45,659
know who knows it might have happened for five years and it looked like diablo 3 to me just looked

1220
04:14:45,659 --> 04:14:52,280
like diablo 3 but they put it on another engine kind of let's put it this way i don't have very

1221
04:14:52,280 --> 04:14:58,600
much confidence that diablo 4 will be a very good game now would i like to be pleasantly surprised

1222
04:14:58,680 --> 04:15:13,180
yes but judging by the fact that in that first itemization preview it was red light green light

1223
04:15:14,260 --> 04:15:20,600
attack defense and they're going back to what why people didn't like diablo 3 in the first place

1224
04:15:24,090 --> 04:15:31,239
and it was i i want to make dumb choices i want to have i want to be able to put 20 fucking points

1225
04:15:31,239 --> 04:15:40,120
i want to have like a bunch of crazy uh fixes you know what i mean i was thinking something

1226
04:15:40,120 --> 04:15:45,719
i didn't like about diablo 3 was everything was tied to weapon damage like no i don't want to

1227
04:15:45,719 --> 04:15:54,549
just have it be uh like 800 weapon damage 1200 weapon damage 375 weapon damage

1228
04:15:55,510 --> 04:16:02,309
just made it too it just yeah it's too samey not only that when you make a character in

1229
04:16:02,309 --> 04:16:06,950
diablo 3 you don't have to make another one ever again if you make a barbarian in diablo 3 that's

1230
04:16:06,950 --> 04:16:10,950
the only character that's the only barbarian you're ever gonna make if you can just be anything you

1231
04:16:10,950 --> 04:16:18,870
just do anything am i ranting am i ranting right now i feel like i am like i'm ranting this is kind

1232
04:16:18,870 --> 04:16:35,450
of ranty but then you have to think back too right so this is like also important is a very

1233
04:16:35,450 --> 04:16:43,129
important part of this conversation the people that made this game none of them are even gonna

1234
04:16:43,129 --> 04:16:47,770
work on it you know what i mean it's this game was made by completely different fucking people

1235
04:16:48,569 --> 04:17:00,680
but 100 different dev team 100 so it's well i really wish we'd get like a true sequel to

1236
04:17:00,680 --> 04:17:04,920
diablo 2 the reason why we're never gonna get a true chrono trigger sequel because

1237
04:17:04,920 --> 04:17:17,819
none they're not they're never gonna be together again where is this waypoint it's like yeah but

1238
04:17:17,819 --> 04:17:25,190
like dozens of three done how did you know i was gonna say dozens of different companies and three

1239
04:17:25,190 --> 04:17:37,530
employees but i corrected myself and then i freaked out that's kind of the nature of

1240
04:17:38,500 --> 04:17:44,739
game development it's kind of a kind of like a sad annoying reality of the whole thing is a lot of

1241
04:17:44,739 --> 04:17:50,500
times when a game comes out there's a lot of just layoffs and changing and you go down all right

1242
04:17:50,500 --> 04:17:54,100
thanks for making that game uh 30 of you no longer work here and you're going to go to different

1243
04:17:54,100 --> 04:18:01,000
companies and we'll never be on the same team again like all of blizzard north was gone after

1244
04:18:01,000 --> 04:18:07,799
diablo 2 gone i don't nobody knows really what happened or why it's like blizzard north did not

1245
04:18:07,799 --> 04:18:13,319
exist anymore after this game may we even working i think on a prototype for diablo 3 and then it

1246
04:18:13,319 --> 04:18:19,540
was like no you're all gone there you go all right you're never gonna get that same it's like the

1247
04:18:19,540 --> 04:18:32,120
series is not even the same series it'd be like if i made a youtube video right let's say let's

1248
04:18:32,120 --> 04:18:38,200
say like tomorrow i upload a youtube video i'm like okay guys here's my next video it's been

1249
04:18:38,200 --> 04:18:44,920
it's been like four years since my latest youtube video check it out and it's another person

1250
04:18:47,610 --> 04:18:53,209
and they're going like hey man what's up it's germa985 here and i'm playing uh i'm playing

1251
04:18:53,209 --> 04:19:08,600
apex legends i feel like this is not even the same person i didn't make that video

1252
04:19:09,319 --> 04:19:22,020
there's even my video still this is even my channel still that's where it gets weird

1253
04:19:22,659 --> 04:19:29,379
because we're led to believe that all these things are sequels but it's like it's not even the same

1254
04:19:29,379 --> 04:19:40,139
people and eventually there it is because eventually i'll find this fucking waypoint

1255
04:19:40,780 --> 04:19:43,399
do miss piggy's shirt

1256
04:20:05,430 --> 04:20:09,450
all right are you guys ready to take on bathisto and maybe die

1257
04:20:11,450 --> 04:20:20,500
86 000 i should probably level up one more time before doing this

1258
04:20:25,340 --> 04:20:28,219
anything that's not a greater healing potion is getting sold

1259
04:20:28,219 --> 04:20:55,350
and even some of the greater hand just sell them once we get to nightmare you're gonna realize that

1260
04:20:55,350 --> 04:21:09,260
this was all not even worth doing but it's okay all right let's go did i redeem a wink

1261
04:21:11,000 --> 04:21:27,209
nah nah save it trust me save it nah save it save it save it save it you want to save it

1262
04:21:28,329 --> 04:21:41,670
we have to find another council by the way which sucks this one's arguably worse than the last one

1263
04:21:42,309 --> 04:21:58,540
you redeem it no you don't be so right about diablo you make me mad kill bathisto

1264
04:21:59,340 --> 04:22:06,309
i need to what's my lightning resistance not very good i have lots of cold but no lightning

04:59:46,180 --> 04:59:50,099
chest backs here that you see locked that's why you should have a key every time you do this

1470
05:08:34,200 --> 05:08:50,790
like i don't know these by heart let me take a look double two rune words cheating that was a

1471
05:08:50,790 --> 05:08:59,180
knot how does the epic game store come up when you type in diablo two rune words that makes no sense

1472
05:09:00,139 --> 05:09:20,099
all right rune words we need okay three socket shield no scepter weapon three socket sword

1473
05:09:21,740 --> 05:09:28,619
to make this king's grace three socket sword or scepter is am ral and ful i don't have ful yet

1474
05:09:28,619 --> 05:09:44,459
though but that's a lot it's a lot of cool shit there's also leaf two sockets stave two socket

1475
05:09:44,459 --> 05:09:58,650
helm is orton soul those are kind of rare two socket helm nef and tier rhyme is shale and f but

1476
05:09:58,650 --> 05:10:07,180
shale is actually is not easy to find i don't have shale it's pretty good what about uh stealth

1477
05:10:07,180 --> 05:10:15,610
yeah talon f two socket body armor that's good but let's poison resist though

1478
05:10:16,569 --> 05:10:22,360
dexterity and poison resist and then a bunch of running and fat you run like really fast

1479
05:10:23,319 --> 05:10:42,340
that's not like not for me tier and l wouldn't be bad am and tier is called strength all right well

1480

bone walls are just to troll people in pvp lobbies let's see sort of accurate

1518
05:21:19,220 --> 05:21:32,069
this really is a big game his weapon he's just doing so what's he doing 53 to 99

1519
05:21:33,110 --> 05:21:37,590
and look at his resistances they're all maxed out wait do you have fire resistance on any of

1520
05:21:37,590 --> 05:21:47,939
shit no you just have it because you're better than me oh i'm also not sure why i keep casting

1521
05:21:47,939 --> 05:22:09,459
bone shield considering there's one point in it begged us for bone shield i did beg you for bone

1522
05:22:09,459 --> 05:22:55,590
shield and you only gave me one skill point i can't even get two stop crying frame oh it's

1523
05:22:55,590 --> 05:23:05,860

1524
05:23:05,860 --> 05:23:16,939
oh

1525
05:23:22,439 --> 05:23:25,139

1529
05:24:08,740 --> 05:24:22,540
so yeah it's at this point i need to start to really pay attention we're going focus

1530
05:24:22,540 --> 05:24:47,209
mode for a little bit until we get close still everybody right yeah thankfully i can hurt you

1547
05:30:34,520 --> 05:30:39,220

1548
05:30:39,220 --> 05:30:57,740
10 random people this amplified damage has such a low radius that i have to cast it five times

1575
05:38:30,229 --> 05:38:38,950
sword or a scepter uh this is going to enhance the damage by 100 so this would be 16 to 40

1576
05:38:39,509 --> 05:38:49,000
pretty great considering uh it will do a an increased 100 damage to demons

1596
05:43:54,470 --> 05:44:05,720
golem's still alive yeah it was a lot of defense it was pretty good item for normal

1597
05:44:06,119 --> 05:44:16,470
so i'm gonna have to farm the pisto for a really amazing unique

1598
05:44:17,669 --> 05:44:25,990
and turn it into a golem so i can kill diablo you are looking into the future right now there he is

1604
05:46:05,580 --> 05:46:36,200
here

1605
05:47:24,889 --> 05:47:30,659
why did you do it why did you do it

1606
05:47:39,080 --> 05:47:53,319
power all right guys this is important thank you hero it goes thank you hero

1607
05:47:53,319 --> 05:48:06,009
is was tortured spirit to rest the light protect you then i fear that we have been played for

1608
05:48:06,009 --> 05:48:12,099
feelings all along is wall helped diablo and his brothers tricked me into using the soul stones

1609
05:48:12,099 --> 05:48:19,319
against them now the stones powers are combined powers of the soul stones under their control

1610
05:48:19,319 --> 05:48:22,759
don't know i know the first line of every single one of these will be able to turn the mortal

1611
05:48:22,759 --> 05:48:30,090
because i've played this game hundreds of hundreds and hundreds of times

1612
05:48:30,090 --> 05:48:39,770
and most of the time the dialogue goes like this long ago i swore i don't know the rest of it

1613
05:48:39,770 --> 05:48:46,500
i just know the first line and i've heard that first line from every character

1614
05:48:47,220 --> 05:49:01,900
probably 2000 times all right this thing sucks one to 54 no junk two skill points bow

1615
05:49:04,040 --> 05:49:18,020
these skill points mean a lot to me this is a big boy 26 to 54

1616
05:49:18,740 --> 05:49:31,189
level one sacrifice an actual melee move that i could use instead of just default shit left click

1617
05:49:31,830 --> 05:49:43,900
it's two handed never mind i'll turn it into a uh bill i don't have room to do that anymore

1618
05:49:51,060 --> 05:49:55,590
all right we have two points to spend in fact i'm gonna hold off on this

1619
05:49:55,590 --> 05:49:59,430
because we're gonna have three points to spend so we're gonna do that first

1620
05:50:00,069 --> 05:50:19,779
i'm gonna keep moving uh where was that was down here right i found the other place to go

1621
05:50:19,779 --> 05:50:29,020
i forget where it is big map here in a second well actually i know it's right down here right

1622
05:50:29,020 --> 05:50:35,849
down here i think it's right here i mean i can run pretty damn fast so i'm not like in any real

percent down here that's 37 resplit but 63 split three times is 21 percent each blame the people

1665
06:02:38,569 --> 06:03:26,060
that are still clicking fire golem where the stats gone that's my fault it had 41 percent versus 34

06:09:21,500 --> 06:09:31,830
it took you guys until act four to start to ruin the game

1684
06:09:35,830 --> 06:09:41,270

to take on the gloves because the gloves can't do anything all right now let's let's do let's do

1764
06:28:21,880 --> 06:28:29,479
humans just like just humans okay is the king supposed to be a human chef boyard he's a human

1765
06:28:30,040 --> 06:28:39,580
is that all right this is a human oh that's not a human that's not a human i thought it was i

1766
06:28:39,580 --> 06:28:45,880
don't know why i thought that okay we didn't get this dog could be classified as a human

1767
06:28:45,880 --> 06:29:04,119
we need real all right this is a human this is a human this is a human in a costume small human

1768
06:29:05,189 --> 06:29:20,650
also small human green huge green human okay okay also human human except this this one has a gun

1769
06:29:23,720 --> 06:29:39,990
right this is supposed to be like a revolutionary guy but it doesn't look like a musket he doesn't

1770
06:29:39,990 --> 06:29:51,619
have like this guy's a musket right all right Ronald McDonald's a human all humans have to be

1771
06:29:51,619 --> 06:29:59,819
on the same tier because there's no they would Wendy's a human this is also cute there's a furry

1772
06:29:59,819 --> 06:30:09,240
right that's a human there's an anthropomorphic human uh no that's no no no no no no i just saw

1773
06:30:09,240 --> 06:30:20,979
the pants and shit this is also a dog okay dog cookie okay baby eats cookie

1774
06:30:22,900 --> 06:30:50,869
cookie stains gloves that's Julius Caesar i don't know who this is but it looks like a person is

1775
06:30:50,869 --> 06:30:58,860
it a person i think that's a human Count Dracula is a fucking creep but he's a human

1776
06:31:02,439 --> 06:31:17,380
and he's like Dracula's cousin so he goes over here all right now we do now it's animals no no

1777
06:31:18,340 --> 06:31:33,020
humans dog bigger dog obviously goes in front this is a cheetah so she's deadly

1778
06:31:34,060 --> 06:31:41,509
all right now we've got Pillsbury Doughboy would just get rolled over someone would step on him

1779
06:31:42,549 --> 06:31:57,270
these guys are supposed to be little right this is a bee but a bee would would just be able to get

1780
06:31:57,270 --> 06:32:08,810
just hit and knocked out by any human polar bear who know hold on we're just gonna get this right

1781
06:32:08,889 --> 06:32:17,819
frog would be down here this is like a wolf or something all right frog versus baby would a

1782
06:32:17,819 --> 06:32:22,060
baby accidentally kill a frog right if there was like a fight going on the baby would just like

1783
06:32:24,549 --> 06:32:38,709
and like roll over in the frog all right fragile but made out of glass so it's got to go higher

1784
06:32:38,709 --> 06:32:44,310
and this is yeah this would this would take this is taking somebody with him

1785
06:32:45,029 --> 06:32:50,180
what do you mean yes he's fragile he's made out of glass this is a big glass pitcher

1786
06:32:52,090 --> 06:32:56,330
all the all the Quaker Oats guy has to do is use the butt of his rifle and

1787
06:32:57,770 --> 06:33:11,299
and shatter him it's fragile he's made of glass he breaks through walls he literally runs through

1788
06:33:11,299 --> 06:33:29,369
walls it's just an owl little dog eats owl no actually owls owls are vicious this is just

1789
06:33:29,369 --> 06:33:35,849
a rabbit I don't be this would be if this would be a tough fight a chihuahua versus a bunny rabbit

1790
06:33:35,849 --> 06:33:55,909
would be that would I don't know bunny no I don't know chihuahuas don't chihuahuas

1791
06:33:55,909 --> 06:34:24,380
just kind of go like this what is this Captain Crunch is canonically microscopic well let's

1792
06:34:24,380 --> 06:34:29,669
let me just this is a big one let me get over this first what is this what is that an animal

1793
06:34:29,669 --> 06:34:40,060
it's a dinosaur I don't recognize a dinosaur all right it goes up here the bear another rabbit

1794
06:34:41,020 --> 06:35:11,959
they're both even doing the same move the Trix rabbit's a predator but okay okay hold on I

1795
06:35:11,959 --> 06:35:16,680
think that I think the Nesquik bunny would would beat the shit out of the Trix rabbit

1796
06:35:20,310 --> 06:35:25,990
they both do the same moves though it's hard they both do like when when the Nesquik rabbit

1797
06:35:25,990 --> 06:35:31,830
sucks up the Nesquik his ears go in a circle around and then when he eats the Trix it goes

1798
06:35:33,130 --> 06:35:36,090
and they wrap it they both do the same move they both move said it's a mirror match

1799
06:35:36,650 --> 06:35:51,540
that's too tricky I don't know this is a rooster I don't know probably down here somewhere this is

1800
06:35:51,540 --> 06:36:00,729
a regular dog all right wait wait wait okay Keebler elf would get stung by the bee and be and it would

1801
06:36:00,729 --> 06:36:05,209
spear him through his chest so he would die it would spear him directly through his heart

1802
06:36:06,169 --> 06:36:16,520
same with these three and a baby a baby okay the baby's leveling up

1803
06:36:17,319 --> 06:36:32,729
but the baby might accidentally eat the bee though okay also these guys tiny right

1804
06:36:36,549 --> 06:36:50,819
snap crackle they like this big yeah bee also kills these three this is a stork all right the

1805
06:36:50,819 --> 06:37:05,319
birds over here the M&Ms all right uh Tony the tiger tiger versus cheetah now that's tricky

1806
06:37:05,959 --> 06:37:19,639
this is just okay this is an apple this is an apple and a cinnamon stick at least the glove can

1807
06:37:19,639 --> 06:37:36,459
grab and squish and crush what am I thinking yeah the glove the hamburger helper could like wrap

1808
06:37:36,459 --> 06:37:42,139
around his neck and just start squeezing all right same here this would be tough because he has teeth

1809
06:37:48,680 --> 06:38:04,950
I think they lose to the frog though the frog destroys him but also he's made out of he's made

1810
06:38:04,950 --> 06:38:13,080
out of he's made out of like polyester the green giant is 55 feet tall we'll get to it

1811
06:38:13,080 --> 06:38:22,340
we're gonna get to it I don't know eat more chicken is this supposed to be just a cow

1812
06:38:22,340 --> 06:38:36,540
it's a cow right and these are just M&Ms but they're kind of big though they're bigger than

1813
06:38:36,540 --> 06:38:51,340
the rabbits and bigger than the chihuahuas human size they're like this big they're like two or

1814
06:38:51,340 --> 06:38:58,569
three feet tall all right let's think about this some nothing can compete with the sun

1815
06:38:59,450 --> 06:39:08,229
is that this is a dinosaur all right green giant you said he's 55 feet tall

1816
06:39:09,270 --> 06:39:26,950
that's just pure size no one can compare oh shit sorry yeah nobody can compare if you're 55 feet

1817
06:39:26,950 --> 06:39:37,700
tall the dinosaur would be tricky but this is like a friendly happy dinosaur this is not like a t-rex

1818
06:39:37,700 --> 06:39:45,880
right but this is also this this is the jolly green giant I don't know that's they're the same

1819
06:39:46,840 --> 06:40:12,860
remember the dinosaur is the size of a macaroni noodle oh it's the craft dinosaur all right you

1820
06:40:12,860 --> 06:40:19,750
actually these two actually can't do anything they just sit there they can't even move you guys are

1821
06:40:19,750 --> 06:40:27,099
all the way down here with this with the shit that is inanimate this would be a hard fight

1822
06:40:32,700 --> 06:40:47,020
please caesar has a massive army at his disposal out in 2020 well if we're judging if we're going

1823
06:40:47,020 --> 06:41:00,599
by that then these two are dead then these two are dead this is no no no no no by the way this

1824
06:41:00,599 --> 06:41:15,580
is little caesar he's like a foot tall I forgot he does have he does have a weapon though little

1825
06:41:15,580 --> 06:41:30,040
caesar is like a foot tall and he has a weapon he might not this the stork might beat him I'm

1826
06:41:30,040 --> 06:41:52,150
not sure little caesar can go up his dog or the bigger birds all right hold on let's get this

1827
06:41:52,150 --> 06:41:58,860
right you don't belong up here although you do crash through build it you like he like breaks

1828
06:41:58,860 --> 06:42:14,619
through like building walls and shit nobody else does that I think he actually might be stronger

1829
06:42:26,490 --> 06:42:36,119
tiger or cheetah probably tiger polar bear or cheetah polar bear sunny the cuckoo bird

1830
06:42:36,759 --> 06:42:51,369
or cheetah tuna fish or cheetah bear bear wolf wolf owl they're both fucked but I don't know

1831
06:42:51,369 --> 06:43:06,360
tuna versus cheetah you know no but okay wait but if we I don't let's I don't know

1832
06:43:07,240 --> 06:43:14,389
no tuna versus bear the tuna is huge they weigh like two thousand they weigh like three thousand

1833
06:43:14,389 --> 06:43:21,659
pounds if a tuna just swims really fast it's like it's like a mack truck running into you

1834
06:43:22,619 --> 06:43:33,959
no they're not well it's a blue whale whatever he's blue tuna's not fucking blue I don't wear

1835
06:43:33,959 --> 06:43:46,310
glasses either bear versus cheetah bear polar bear versus just regular bear this is a grizzly bear

1836
06:43:46,310 --> 06:44:00,700
what kind of bear is he no polar bear polar bear or tiger it's probably tiger the tigers are huge

1837
06:44:00,700 --> 06:44:11,669
and they're deadly tuna versus wolf all right this is where it gets I don't know if a wolf would

1838
06:44:11,750 --> 06:44:36,340
kill a tuna that had to be done it's just too powerful it's too many powers okay this is uh

1839
06:44:36,340 --> 06:44:44,619
let's get to the humans also two feet tall he is and he like two feet no no he's not he's just

1840
06:44:44,619 --> 06:44:52,470
kind of like he's just kind of a regular dude how I think most people could probably beat up a cow

1841
06:44:53,509 --> 06:45:03,830
in fact he's super old yeah he is old what I don't know what this guy is what is this thing

1842
06:45:14,569 --> 06:45:25,159
wario what is that that's john what a burger right what is he superhero is he just a guy in

1843
06:45:25,159 --> 06:45:48,500
a suit I don't get it what is he he's a superhero I'm not sure he well superhero but what are his

1844
06:45:48,500 --> 06:45:56,310
powers eating a shitload of calories like what do you how are you a hamburger how are you a hamburger

1845
06:45:56,310 --> 06:46:03,590
superhero ronald mcdonald is a hamburger character but he's not a superhero what does that even mean

1846
06:46:16,580 --> 06:46:20,180
yeah he can fly and he has super strength what do we know that though

1847
06:46:21,299 --> 06:46:33,060
or is this just somebody is this just a cosplay yes it's canon so then he has to be up here

1848
06:46:33,860 --> 06:46:43,020
if you're a superhero then you're up here if you can fly and super strength like obviously

1849
06:46:43,020 --> 06:46:48,520
you're going to be next to the guy that can crash through walls I still don't think he would win

1850
06:46:49,080 --> 06:46:57,259
maybe he would but I don't I'm not going to give it to him all right the king

1851
06:46:58,220 --> 06:47:13,459
just a guy these are all just humans wendy I think wrong okay this guy's got a gun so he's

1852
06:47:13,459 --> 06:47:27,159
always up at the top in fact he might be above the birds oh shit he might actually be above

1853
06:47:27,159 --> 06:47:46,200
tony the tiger he's got his revolutionary musket he would just shoot these people

1854
06:47:48,020 --> 06:48:04,380
what quaker a member of the religious society of friends that's a real name

1855
06:48:06,279 --> 06:48:12,979
religious society of friends a christian movement founded by george fox devoted to

1856
06:48:12,979 --> 06:48:18,419
peaceful principles central to the quaker's belief is the doctrine of the inner light

1857
06:48:19,299 --> 06:48:46,310
they're past the pacifists the fucking pacifist well then you're gonna get you're gonna get

1858
06:48:47,349 --> 06:48:56,970
bit to death by the apple good for you in this battle of all wits and skills the glove is

1859
06:48:56,970 --> 06:49:05,110
gonna just like suffocate you whatever the peanut would choke him peanuts dead he died he died

1860
06:49:06,069 --> 06:49:27,770
today he died this afternoon the rest of this is just like who got the first point I mean this

1861
06:49:27,770 --> 06:49:31,689
is this is this guy's all the way to the bottom is it you know how hard it is to be in one of

1862
06:49:31,689 --> 06:49:43,540
these suits it's hard for Mickey Mouse to even lean down and give you a hug in this he'd get

1863
06:49:43,779 --> 06:50:03,509
get mauled by the rooster maybe uh you lose to a dog you would he said he said captain crunches

1864
06:50:03,509 --> 06:50:10,040
is like it's like this no he's not there's like children in those commercials this would be a

1865
06:50:10,040 --> 06:50:39,220
fight no there's no way you lose you lose uh king this is just another person in a costume

1866
06:50:40,180 --> 06:50:55,750
why is wendy so strong if she pushed you just you push an old man down he's gonna die

1867
06:50:56,790 --> 06:51:15,909
he's all old men and these people are two feet tall how big is what is a king to a god a vampire

1868
06:51:15,909 --> 06:51:29,819
can't die i feel like this owl would just shred him up he's just still a person wait he can turn

1869
06:51:29,819 --> 06:51:47,669
to a bat yeah that's fine you're old you're old you're old ronald mcdonald though

1870
06:51:56,310 --> 06:52:01,430
how old is how old is wendy is when he's supposed to be like 12 or like 15 or something how old is

1871
06:52:01,430 --> 06:52:34,970
wendy just like 50 no i mean like now everybody's gonna throw haymakers i don't know if you're

1872
06:52:36,009 --> 06:52:40,090
fighting an owl though i feel like you you you'd probably win but you'd get

1873
06:52:40,090 --> 06:53:05,080
fucked up these are all the people that would lose to the to a vicious owl i mean if you were

1874
06:53:05,080 --> 06:53:24,180
big enough it how big is wendy is she like five four feet tall all right this is more accurate

1875
06:53:24,180 --> 06:53:28,900
the elderly would not you think chef boyardee is going to get attacked by a fucking owl

1876
06:53:30,630 --> 06:54:09,380
he's these guys they're they're toast donald sanders makes chicken for a living he kills

1877
06:54:09,380 --> 06:54:16,819
all birds but if he were face to face with a giant bird he's going to lose

1878
06:54:17,939 --> 06:54:31,189
he also walks around with a cane if you think that a giant fucking bird is not going to beat

1879
06:54:31,189 --> 06:54:43,500
colonel sanders this is just going to can open his head it's a hidden weapon cane that's not

1880
06:54:43,500 --> 06:55:04,020
part of any lore that's not true that's not part of any lore i think this is legit

1881
06:55:04,659 --> 06:55:37,259
hmm the dog might just okay wait the dog we're leveling dog up and cow little caesar has a spear

1882
06:55:37,259 --> 06:55:48,009
why is he so low because he's this big he's this big that spear is the equivalent of you getting

1883
06:55:48,009 --> 06:56:02,619
stabbed from the end of a straw and how much weight do you think he can put behind that spear

1884
06:56:03,580 --> 06:56:13,990
this guy weighs like 14 pounds you think he's going to be able to skewer you with a spear this

1885
06:56:13,990 --> 06:56:34,470
big and he's 14 pounds and he's eating he's currently eating always and his eyes are closed

1886
06:56:38,599 --> 06:56:47,560
you're going to be scared of that guy everybody else here has their eyes open he's the only one

1887
06:56:47,560 --> 06:57:18,439
that's not prepared also the only one currently eating quicker has god to back him up but he can

1888
06:57:18,439 --> 06:57:25,500
open his eyes he's eating a pizza every time you've ever seen little caesar ever he's been

1889
06:57:25,500 --> 06:57:30,459
consuming a pizza he's what he thinks he's going to lose that during a fight no this is that's his

1890
06:57:30,459 --> 06:57:40,119
lore that's what he does he's going to be eating a pizza why is quaker all the way quaker is a

1891
06:57:40,200 --> 06:57:51,959
pacifist i've got yelled at for this he might be able to he might be able to kill the rats all

1892
06:57:51,959 --> 06:58:04,259
right fine quaker has old man strength all right he would accidentally fucking step on some of

1893
06:58:04,259 --> 06:58:11,659
these things yeah okay they can eat right like of course they could they can eat he can eat

1894
06:58:11,659 --> 06:58:17,419
cookies he can eat bread he could eat apples all right he would eat he can eat he would eat these

1895
06:58:17,419 --> 06:58:22,779
guys if he like if he maybe he wouldn't know they were people and he ate them i don't know

1896
06:58:28,540 --> 06:58:32,709
what about the glove this glove can't do anything it doesn't have fingers all this thing can do is

1897
06:58:32,709 --> 06:58:42,520
scream at least these other things have arms or legs it's in a series of armless legless

1898
06:58:43,240 --> 06:58:48,139
faces that will just scream they're all in a row they're all in the same level

1899
06:58:48,139 --> 06:59:08,599
oh this thing might be punching and kicking and punching but the glove kills him the glove

1900
06:59:08,599 --> 06:59:26,200
just wraps around his neck don't underestimate the cinnamon toast crunch guys yeah that's true

1901
06:59:27,000 --> 06:59:32,569
that's yeah this he can't do anything they would just stick their fingers in his eyes over and over

1902
06:59:32,569 --> 06:59:47,619
again until he passed out or something i don't know still on diavolo 2 yeah we're probably

1903
06:59:47,619 --> 07:00:00,020
gonna call it here in a little bit turkey fried chicken presents the kernel of two worlds volume

1904
07:00:00,020 --> 07:00:11,349
one one and mr peanut's already dead please remember there's a literal baby above eat here

1905
07:00:11,349 --> 07:00:22,310
okay now explain to me how a a baby would not be able to defeat somebody that is an inch tall

1906
07:00:25,299 --> 07:01:20,500
or a single bee or a frog so the glove is gonna be taco bell dog but yeah but okay so but

1907
07:01:22,889 --> 07:01:29,689
but the the quaker guy here's the wall this is the problem the baby is the wall because

1908
07:01:30,490 --> 07:01:39,529
anything below baby needs to be able to be killed or defeated by being rolled over accidentally

1909
07:01:39,529 --> 07:01:54,259
everything else on this list it could the quaker guy does not that doesn't fit that category all

1910
07:01:54,259 --> 07:02:15,700
right quaker beats baby glove chokes quaker bunny rabbit eats glove done glove would just no it

1911
07:02:15,700 --> 07:02:23,590
wouldn't no no but it wouldn't though it wouldn't no it wouldn't no it wouldn't no it wouldn't

1912
07:02:23,590 --> 07:02:55,750
it wouldn't it just this is a pacifist no no i can't have that quakers used to hunt

1913
07:02:55,750 --> 07:03:02,540
so they have a gun thank you very much so he goes back to where he was before

1914
07:03:03,180 --> 07:03:21,220
but they don't shoot people but what's the all right so they hunt but they don't hunt

1915
07:03:21,220 --> 07:03:28,119
they're a pacifist but they they they shoot stuff they don't if chef boyardee sprinting at the

1916
07:03:28,119 --> 07:03:40,439
quaker in a full fucking sprint with a hatchet in his hand is he going to shoot him is the answer

1917
07:03:40,439 --> 07:04:14,439
no that would go against the ideology the answer is no and he's he's getting strangled by the glove

1918
07:04:36,779 --> 07:04:49,959
the quaker wouldn't kill the quaker wouldn't kill any the quaker oh he won't kill anything else he

1919
07:04:49,959 --> 07:05:15,209
won't attack but he'll attack a baby like that's not accurate the baby baby baby attacks quaker

1920
07:05:16,090 --> 07:05:31,139
yes defeats quaker glove defeats baby be yeah a quaker would like oops

1921
07:05:32,180 --> 07:05:45,639
how does baby kill quaker do you understand this is a paradox how does baby kill quaker how does

1922
07:05:45,639 --> 07:06:01,479
quaker kill baby paradox he wouldn't fight so he would die he wouldn't fight so he wouldn't kill

1923
07:06:02,200 --> 07:06:23,099
you understand the paradox here he'd be outlived all right that's fair all right let's go let's

1924
07:06:23,099 --> 07:06:44,700
it i'm done quaker in his own tier no he's just a guy baby starves to death no baby eats bee baby

1925
07:06:44,700 --> 07:06:50,759
eats keibler elf no no this has nothing to do with eating people this is fighting right this

1926
07:06:50,759 --> 07:06:59,430
is nothing to do with eating anybody all right that's it all right what no no no there it is

1927
07:06:59,990 --> 07:07:26,299

2009
07:25:55,939 --> 07:26:05,270
it looks in the inventory clutter like having 16 mana potions and 12 healing potions five different

2019
07:27:37,060 --> 07:27:46,650
afternoon because when i was in boston i started 7 p.m my time and i was late all the time so it

2020
07:27:46,650 --> 07:27:59,270
really turned out to be like 7 30 7 45 my time pm so i had i had to pull back my time to be able to

2021
07:27:59,270 --> 07:28:06,939
make it so there was no change your time you know what i mean i pulled the stream back about four

2022
07:28:07,020 --> 07:28:13,930
hours just to make it so it didn't start eu time like four o'clock in the morning or something

2023
07:28:16,860 --> 07:28:23,990
but i can't go much earlier than that i really can't i am not at my most energetic until at

prilla d five community subs thanks both of you now if you guys think that i can't reliably turn

2037
07:31:12,970 --> 07:31:21,540
a stream on between you know one to two p.m or like two to three p.m you know how exponentially

2038
07:31:21,540 --> 07:31:28,259
more unreliable i get every hour you go back you are talking about scenarios where i will sleep

2039
07:31:28,259 --> 07:31:35,180
through an entire stream oh hey i'm streaming it tomorrow at 8 a.m between like seven and eight

2040
07:31:35,180 --> 07:31:43,990
a.m pacific i'm gonna wake up at like 11 30 and it's gonna be like oh shit no no no i'm supposed

2041
07:31:43,990 --> 07:31:49,029
to stream and i'm gonna fucking rip out of bed and throw water in my face i'm gonna no that's

2042
07:31:49,029 --> 07:32:08,740
not happening i'm gonna sleep through every alarm i think this the sweet spot for me somewhere

2043
07:32:08,740 --> 07:32:18,020
between 1 30 p.m and like 3 30 p.m between like one and four is where almost every single stream

2044
07:32:18,020 --> 07:32:22,020
is going to start depending on the day and who i'm playing with and what i'm doing do i have

2045
07:32:22,020 --> 07:32:41,299
anything to do during the day or at night that's the sweet spot for me stream at 1 a.m

2046
07:32:43,880 --> 07:32:52,009
i it's weird no my my i'm no i can't because then i'll that's just i'll fuck up my sleep schedule

2047
07:32:52,009 --> 07:33:00,330
forever if i turn a stream on at like 11 to 12 p.m like 11 to 12 a.m like 11 p.m to 12 or 1 a.m

2048
07:33:00,330 --> 07:33:08,810
right i'm gonna be going to bed at like seven o'clock in the morning and then i'm just toast

2049
07:33:09,610 --> 07:33:16,889
you just reversed forever i've been on that schedule before and i hated it i did not like

2050
07:33:16,889 --> 07:33:26,759
it at all it kind of fucks with you you start to feel just strange after three or four weeks of

2051
07:33:26,759 --> 07:33:33,080
being on a schedule where you're going to sleep when the sun comes up and waking up when the sun

2052
07:33:33,080 --> 07:33:39,340
goes down it's just oh i have to do it for like i did it for like four or five months just total

2053
07:33:40,060 --> 07:33:43,259
maybe like three months in a row and it was just like holy shit i feel

2054
07:33:44,139 --> 07:33:58,220
just odd if you are able to do a true night shift then seriously more power to you because

2055
07:33:58,779 --> 07:34:10,180
i could never do it it's nice for a little it is nice for a little while because the world kind

2056
07:34:10,180 --> 07:34:17,060
of turns off and i hear something inherently nice and relaxing and almost it's like your own person

2057
07:34:17,060 --> 07:34:23,380
a little world because there's nothing is not there's no cars really going around

2058
07:34:24,520 --> 07:34:29,080
there's nobody calling you there's you don't have like an errand to do at 3 30 in the morning

2059
07:34:29,880 --> 07:34:38,680
four in the morning you get to live in your own personal little world but once that overstays

2060
07:34:39,560 --> 07:34:59,740
you can get bad for some people they love it and i hope you do but anyway a cream corn

2061
07:35:00,700 --> 07:35:05,990
thanks for the 250 250 bits from a longtime viewer here never knew that you'd love this

2062
07:35:05,990 --> 07:35:23,779
game so dearly do you think you've played it more than tf2 i don't know probably not because

2063
07:35:27,220 --> 07:35:33,700
i had time constraints when i used to play this at at its peak about three to four hours a night

2064
07:35:34,419 --> 07:35:40,099
i played it every day for years i played d2 every single day probably two or three years straight

2065
07:35:41,900 --> 07:35:49,270
but i was under time constraints because i was still in high school so i couldn't stay up i

2066
07:35:49,270 --> 07:35:56,700
could only really play for a few hours a night team fortress 2 was when i was in college and

2067
07:35:56,700 --> 07:36:06,459
then after college when i had every single day besides going to classes so instead of three to

2068
07:36:06,540 --> 07:36:24,020
four hours a day i could play tf2 for like eight to ten so he didn't study a six hour session

2069
07:36:24,020 --> 07:36:31,000
in tf2 was like ah that was that was awesome so just based on that alone that i don't didn't

2070
07:36:31,000 --> 07:36:37,349
have as many time constraints as i did when i was a teenager i would say yes tf2 probably at least

2071
07:36:37,349 --> 07:36:48,599
30 more uh doug mendio thanks again for 500 bits what would be your advice for motivation for a

2072
07:36:48,599 --> 07:36:53,459
project i have albums worth of music and my girlfriend really wants to see me finish the

2073
07:36:53,459 --> 07:37:03,770
record but sometimes i feel a bit scared to finish it just do it finish it because you don't know

2074
07:37:03,770 --> 07:37:09,860
what the end product is until it's done and i know we're getting the foreheads here right just do it

2075
07:37:09,860 --> 07:37:23,340
forehead but you have to take shots there's no such thing as a hypothetical shot you have to take it

2076
07:37:23,340 --> 07:37:34,569
you have to there's no hypothetical shot that's the way in gretzky quote it's true you miss

2077
07:37:34,569 --> 07:37:43,779
100 of the shots that you don't take wayne gretzky wayne gretzky smarter than albert einstein

2078
07:37:43,779 --> 07:37:56,490
because of that quote so you don't know you might finish that you might finish whatever you're doing

2079
07:37:57,450 --> 07:38:01,209
and go holy shit that this is great this is awesome i'm going to do it again

2080
07:38:02,619 --> 07:38:06,139
rather than hypothetically thinking what might happen if you do or do not do it

2081
07:38:06,779 --> 07:38:23,700
you can't miss if you don't shoot though it makes no logical sense well then revise it if you don't

2082
07:38:23,700 --> 07:38:40,099
take any shots you don't have an opportunity to make any goals there you go if you don't take any

2083
07:38:40,099 --> 07:38:52,310
shots one day you are going to die well yes of all of us eventually sure you don't take it

2084
07:38:53,799 --> 07:39:03,110
but you could say but you could say if if you cut your lawn tomorrow eventually one day you'll die

2085
07:39:05,340 --> 07:39:24,459
that could be if you drink water today you'll die eventually no i won't i won't die oh monkey i'm

2086
07:39:24,459 --> 07:39:33,979
drinking water right now but yeah you just have to let yourself do it you have to you just have to

2087
07:39:33,979 --> 07:39:40,580
try to do it try to finish it see how you feel when you're done you might have great things to

2088
07:39:40,580 --> 07:39:49,610
say you don't know give it a try hey airless thanks for the 250 bits didn't you say like five

2089
07:39:49,610 --> 07:39:53,689
years ago that when co-op was available on stardew valley you'd play it again i did say that

2090
07:39:54,250 --> 07:40:06,279
then i watched my girlfriend 100 percent the whole game so kim 100 percented the entire game

2091
07:40:06,840 --> 07:40:15,270
and i sat behind her and or on the couch and watched almost the whole thing i got to be the

2092
07:40:15,270 --> 07:40:39,099
viewer this time stardew valley why didn't she let you sit next to her on the couch no i'm saying

07:41:02,470 --> 07:41:17,459
of the twinkies that of the twinkie box in one sitting just be careful i know it seems like a

2155
07:52:13,720 --> 07:52:25,700
welcome sad e clown uh somnus thanks for the 500 bits uncut gems was robbed adam sandler should

2156
07:52:25,700 --> 07:52:34,900
have been on that ballot for best actor unfortunate apple shift thanks for the 250 bro i feel you man

2157
07:52:34,900 --> 07:52:40,020
i'm a huge night owl and a few summers ago i got completely nocturnal i went to bed at 6 a.m and

2158
07:52:40,020 --> 07:52:45,220
woke up at 5 p.m every day it's honestly really fun at first but after a while you just start to

2159
07:52:45,220 --> 07:52:57,299
feel like garbage yeah it happens and then it takes you so long to fix because even if you stay up

2160
07:52:57,299 --> 07:53:01,939
i'm gonna stay up all day and all night and then i'm gonna fix it and i'm gonna bet it doesn't work

2161
07:53:02,659 --> 07:53:07,220
you end up sleeping the same amount of time in different random time you'll wake up after four

2162
07:53:07,220 --> 07:53:25,479
hours stay up and then sleep for six hours it sucks how do you fix it you want to know the

2163
07:53:25,479 --> 07:53:30,360
real way to fix your sleep schedule and i mean this this is no bullshit this is true this is

2164
07:53:30,360 --> 07:53:44,919
actually real it's with food you have to eat at normal times if you do not wait till you are

2165
07:53:44,919 --> 07:53:51,959
hungry to eat at four or five o'clock in the morning your body will start to regulate itself

2166
07:53:51,959 --> 07:54:04,200
around your clock of eating food so if you just try to keep your meals out of like the wild zone

2167
07:54:07,770 --> 07:54:19,509
it actually can help am i serious no i i'm serious you look it up it actually like eating

2168
07:54:19,509 --> 07:54:25,400
at like normal times like keeps you regular no this ain't fake no it's not i promise

2169
07:54:35,700 --> 07:54:44,169
yeah how to fix your sleep schedule a late dinner can delay sleep so eat your last meal two to three

2170
07:54:44,169 --> 07:54:49,689
