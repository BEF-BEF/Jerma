1
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:25,059
How's it going? What is happening? How are you? What kind of tea do I got?

2
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:35,909
Uh, black tea today, actually. I said I don't drink black tea, but I really want the caffeine today.

3
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:47,670
And it's black tea with nothing in it, which is the worst kind of black tea.

4
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:56,109
Black tea with nothing in it just kind of tastes like water with.

5
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:02,579
Okay. Do you know, you don't like it like a seltzer water.

6
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:09,900
Seltzer water just has that it's water with a little bit of flavor, just a little bit.

7
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:16,219
It's a black tea is just kind of dry water with a hint of something kind of bitter.

8
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:23,150
I normally would put honey or sugar in it, but not today. I don't really have any.

9
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:36,019
All right. Let me, let me tweet and we'll go. Give me one second.

10
00:01:36,019 --> 00:02:16,270
All right. Let me get comfortable this out of the way today. We're going to play a world box.

11
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:21,039
This was in the recommended channel. Looks pretty fun.

12
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,460
It's a game where you just kind of control everything.

13
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:31,650
I guess you watch civilizations kind of come and go.

14
00:02:32,449 --> 00:02:39,009
The God game seems kind of fun. I've heard it's very, very interesting.

15
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:48,780
They just had an update, I think. Uh, it looks like a day or two ago today.

16
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,490
Maybe I don't even know. God complex Andy.

17
00:02:54,289 --> 00:03:00,219
Hey, are you drinking hot Dr. Pepper?

18
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:16,379
I feel like that would not be as bad as I think it is. It's bad.

19
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:23,490
If you okay, if you took 70% of the sugar. Oh, fuck. Hold on. I got to restart the game.

20
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:31,900
Hold on a second. I've been idling here for like 20 minutes. Hold on. I gotta restart.

21
00:03:37,729 --> 00:03:40,530
If you took like 70% of the sugar out of Dr. Pepper,

22
00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:43,490
I feel like it would not even be bad hot.

23
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:55,310
Although I have no idea. It could be awful. Let me reopen it.

24
00:03:56,849 --> 00:04:01,759
All right. Is this a randomly generated? I think it is.

25
00:04:04,289 --> 00:04:10,099
There we go. Okay. Move back over here and come on.

26
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:17,339
Hey, there it is. Turn the volume on. There's no sound or anything yet.

27
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:25,680
All right. So this is, this is it. This is world box. I'm very ready.

28
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:32,500
Tutorial bear. Let me just take a nice sip of my tea.

29
00:04:38,269 --> 00:04:41,519
Hi there. I'm tutorial bear. Take a moment and hear me out.

30
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:45,279
Super world box is a game about creation and destruction.

31
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:52,610
Control is simple. W A S D arrow mouse. There's a lot of info. Hold on.

32
00:04:52,610 --> 00:05:01,360
W A S D arrow keys to move the camera. Right. Q and E to control zoom.

33
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,899
One, two, three, four, five to select powers and then escape quits the game.

34
00:05:05,899 --> 00:05:09,920
I'm going to accidentally press that. It's literally only four. Yeah.

35
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:17,180
But it was just like, all right. So it's Q E W A S D. I got it.

36
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,620
All your powers are the bottom panel. Here are some important buttons.

37
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:26,339
The save button. Use it to save and load your worlds.

38
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:29,500
Custom worlds. Create worlds with bigger size.

39
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,980
World laws. Customize rules for your world.

40
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,980
Drawing. Tools to create your world so you can make your own world.

41
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:45,230
Oh, this is like a dragon or something. Change brush size for some powers.

42
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:51,810
This button will be on the left. Civilizations. Use it to create villages

43
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:55,220
and mess with kingdoms. Creatures and monsters.

44
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,000
Looking for dragons. That's the place. All right.

45
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,120
Nature and disasters. There's also some tools to help your civilization.

46
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:05,889
Destruction. Here you can find bombs and nukes.

47
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:11,649
Okay. And other various powers and menus.

48
00:06:11,649 --> 00:06:15,199
There's so much stuff in there. Try them out and experiment.

49
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:24,939
Enjoy the game. Oh, shit. Okay. What do I do?

50
00:06:24,939 --> 00:06:43,899
I just wiped out the only fire. Oops. Can I restart?

51
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:53,139
Don't give me this power in the first five seconds of the game.

52
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:56,339
All right. Create your world. All right. I'm making my own world.

53
00:06:56,339 --> 00:07:07,139
I'm deleting all this. Oh, my goodness. You didn't save it.

54
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:12,860
It doesn't matter. All right. How do I make a new world?

55
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:17,360
Create new world. Here it is. All right. Choose the size and select a template.

56
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:28,220
Continent. Oh, shit. Okay. Hold on. So these are the resources.

57
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:33,759
So I think, do people just live? Animals start to spawn? What is this?

58
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:40,019
A bee. It shows how many kills it has. What the fuck?

59
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:46,160
All right. Hold on. This is the Fortnite map. Wait. Let me look at it again.

60
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:52,500
Continent. One big landmass. Box world. Islands. Boring planes.

61
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,879
Donut. Toast. Pancake. I think we'll start with this.

62
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:03,339
We'll just start with... I gotta figure out how to play.

63
00:08:03,339 --> 00:08:10,819
Cool. So let's see. All right. How do I get people?

64
00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:16,370
Civilizations, kingdoms, and villages. Okay. Kings and leaders.

65
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:31,360
See the location. Oh, we got trees. Oh, humans. Basic human with basic needs.

66
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,159
Where should I put them? Will they just start a civilization?

67
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:44,940
All right. So what do they do? All right. Good luck.

68
00:08:46,769 --> 00:08:49,649
All right. We're going to spawn an alligator. Oh, wait. They're starting.

69
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:03,600
Wait. They're going to kill it? Now he's like a... What is this structure?

70
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:12,850
The only two humans on earth. I guess the one... Uh-oh. They're retreating.

71
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:19,059
Oh, no. Oh. Fucking assholes. Nuke them.

72
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:23,940
Okay. Humans? Elves? All right. Let's do like...

73
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:29,220
How many humans should we do? All right. All right. All right. All right.

74
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:34,049
Let's do... I got like... What? Okay. Should I put elves somewhere?

75
00:09:34,049 --> 00:09:40,929
What about orcs? All right. Dwarves. Will they be friends?

76
00:09:40,929 --> 00:09:44,190
Didn't I play this already? I did not. All right. So they made a fire.

77
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,429
They're making like a house or something. There's a mine here.

78
00:09:46,429 --> 00:09:58,580
All right. Let's put the dwarves over here. All right. So there's 10 dwarves.

79
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:03,250
New kingdom. Wait. They made a new kingdom.

80
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:16,659
Okay. Let's put animals here too. Hold on. I'm just... I gotta populate the world.

81
00:10:22,429 --> 00:10:31,409
Turtles and shit. Okay. Cool. Make a frog kingdom.

82
00:10:31,409 --> 00:10:33,730
Uh... All right. We'll put the frogs down here.

83
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:44,850
I'm not fucking up the whole ecosystem, right?

84
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:57,580
Piranha? Rhinos? What is this? Oh, this is the king.

85
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:18,990
This is the king of the dwarves. So I think they just... Do they have children?

86
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:25,710
View kingdom. There's 10 people in Gursul. They have one village.

87
00:11:30,539 --> 00:11:36,690
They're researching. Okay. This is just gonna end up... Did they fight?

88
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:45,340
Will they become friends? All right. Hold on. What about the sponge? Vortex?

89
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:51,460
Shovel? Wait. I can make mountains.

90
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:55,309
Shallow water. All right. I'm gonna make a mountain range over by the dwarves.

91
00:11:55,309 --> 00:12:10,240
Oh, they already have mountains. Oops. Oopsie.

92
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:16,929
What do you mean you've ruined it? No. They live in the mountains.

93
00:12:16,929 --> 00:12:21,070
Oh, wait. I think they are having children. All right. 10 versus...

94
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:24,059
No. I have to make it even. I'm gonna make it even.

95
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:35,139
Three more, right? I'm gonna put rhinos up here too.

96
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:43,740
Oh, we'll put rhino island. Nature? Temperature? Oh, I'm making it hot.

97
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:48,500
No, no, no. I don't want to do that. Make rat island?

98
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:57,860
Okay. Can they build structures? That would be actually pretty funny if they could.

99
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:01,139
The humans are developing a lot faster than the dwarves are.

100
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:09,440
What's going on here? Their favorite food is sushi.

101
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:18,179
The dwarves' favorite food is sushi. What? What are the humans' favorite food?

102
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:23,919
What is this? Cider. Okay. What traits?

103
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:31,200
Peaceful. Never attacks first. They have individual names. Okay.

104
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:40,190
Oh, yes. The dwarves love sushi. The dwarves are probably eating raw meat.

105
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:48,269
What are you doing? Oh, I guess they have different preferences. Never mind.

106
00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:54,929
Stop poking me. Okay. All right. Let's make some more kings and leaders.

107
00:13:54,929 --> 00:14:04,379
Yeah. Who? They show up on the map. Show... Wait. Armies? Enemies? Boats?

108
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:14,720
What? 12. Wait. Okay. So the humans are developing faster than the dwarves

109
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,799
with the, you know, civilization. But the dwarves are...

110
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:27,710
They're having more children faster. Okay. Let's add some more.

111
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:32,480
Uh-oh. Oh, should I leave it? Should I just see what happens?

112
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:41,409
The dwarves are having way more sex than the humans. Coffee?

113
00:14:41,409 --> 00:14:47,470
Bless creatures to make them stronger. Madness?

114
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:54,080
Divine light. Oh, my God. Oh, wait, wait, hold on. The humans are catching up.

115
00:14:54,080 --> 00:15:01,490
The dwarves have... They're currently mastering the navy.

116
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:08,740
Wait a minute. Where are they going? What is this thing?

117
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:17,950
There's nobody even on this boat. Why were they... They couldn't just... They

118
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:24,159
couldn't walk this way? It's a fishing boat. Okay. They're

119
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:36,590
keeping up. Should we add another kingdom? Yes. Okay.

120
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:43,620
Um, what should we do? Orcs? Or elves? All right. Orcs.

121
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:49,919
Where's it gonna be the orc? Okay, the orcs are gonna be up here. Yeah, like here.

122
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:57,139
Okay, they're already attacked. How many do I need? Ten?

123
00:15:57,139 --> 00:16:15,740
All right. That's good. Okay, there are 13. The orcs are OP.

124
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:28,620
Save this. Statistics. 15 years. It's taken 15 years and it's only... You only

125
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:33,200
could... Okay. Infected? Natural death?

126
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:40,019
Death from hunger? Creatures eaten? New village has been founded.

127
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:43,779
New kingdom has been founded. Okay, the orcs are progressing rapidly.

128
00:16:43,779 --> 00:17:00,460
All right, they're doing well. All right, we got to put the elves down here too

129
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,059
then. All right, should the elves be on like a little

130
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:08,480
island or something? No, they'll be down here. Far away. Far

131
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,009
away. And the elves have been around for centuries, so there's gonna be like 20

132
00:17:13,009 --> 00:17:23,339
of them already. Oh wait, this is the frog kingdom!

133
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:27,859
Oh shit. I may have just caused a problem. That's okay, right?

134
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:41,250
What the hell is this? I didn't make this a giggly?

135
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:51,779
Okay, well, they'll be all right. So we have the... Wait, what's this?

136
00:17:51,779 --> 00:18:00,579
Is this a different... Who is this? Is this an orc?

137
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:06,849
So wait, this one guy made his own kingdom.

138
00:18:06,849 --> 00:18:15,920
This guy's fucked. Okay, well, good luck. Wait a minute. No, it's got two now. All

139
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:23,220
right, let's just see what happens. This is interesting to me. All right,

140
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:35,410
they're doing a little... They're expanding. Uh-oh. Okay, we already got this. Now I

141
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:42,319
need to... All right, let's let's add some stuff.

142
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:47,309
Let's bless the elves. No, they have plenty of frogs.

143
00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:51,500
I'm gonna... Okay, I'm gonna bless this kingdom with chickens.

144
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:58,460
I don't know if that does anything. I don't know if that matters, but whatever. I

145
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:09,839
think there's gonna be conflict here. Bless them with rain. Rain. All right,

146
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:12,720
who's... Who do we bless with rain? These are the

147
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:33,519
underdogs. Here, I grant you rain. There you go. And candy.

148
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:41,980
Click show kingdom zones in the civilization menu.

149
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:50,059
Interesting. This is like a game of risk. Funny, okay.

150
00:19:50,059 --> 00:20:08,819
So how do they own this much land? Click on the boats.

151
00:20:08,819 --> 00:20:15,890
Um, I don't know what these boats are doing. Uh, humans,

152
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:21,630
should I bless... All right, we'll bless them again with

153
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:29,809
uh, enchanted seeds. No, that's cheating. How about let's bless them with an

154
00:20:29,809 --> 00:20:37,809
earthquake. Acid. You're progressing too quickly.

155
00:20:37,809 --> 00:20:51,440
It's time for you to have to deal with some acid. Plain soil.

156
00:20:51,440 --> 00:21:01,569
It's... They've slowed down. Favorite food. Burgers.

157
00:21:01,569 --> 00:21:19,089
Children zero. Children four, okay. Likes bread. Children eight. Holy shit.

158
00:21:19,089 --> 00:21:24,029
You are responsible for a major percentage of everybody here.

159
00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:42,299
What about you? Zero. Ten. There's two people here that are

160
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:47,650
responsible for half of the village. All of these...

161
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:54,690
They're currently in there now. Okay. Where are you going?

162
00:21:54,690 --> 00:22:01,099
They're expanding. What's this? What's going on? What's this? What are they doing?

163
00:22:01,099 --> 00:22:07,180
What is this? What's this banner? Wait, they have shields.

164
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:18,109
Uh-oh. They're getting ready for war already?

165
00:22:18,109 --> 00:22:28,500
With who? War has already been declared. Should I slow them down?

166
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:38,220
I'm gonna slow them down. What the fuck was that?

167
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:45,359
I didn't do that. What's happening? Where is that happening?

168
00:22:45,359 --> 00:23:01,069
I'm not doing that. Wait, are they fighting? Oh shit!

169
00:23:01,069 --> 00:23:05,819
No, it's... Oh, let me bless them. That's unfair.

170
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:18,880
That's not fair. They just got... They get lightning striked?

171
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:28,349
You good? Everything's good to go? Random lightning strikes?

172
00:23:28,349 --> 00:23:32,450
Give them money. Yeah, their kingdom kind of sucks.

173
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:43,650
Sponges. Copies pixels under it to others around it.

174
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:54,220
Pickaxe. Removes grass. Shows where... Oh, shows where armies are going.

175
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:57,740
Shows where armies are going to attack when...

176
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:04,990
Some other god hates these elves. Okay, so it's showing where they're gonna

177
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:15,660
attack. I think, wait, people are dying in the

178
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:20,670
in the elf camp. I definitely want to see where they're

179
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:33,069
going. What happened here? This kingdom is

180
00:24:33,069 --> 00:24:39,900
disintegrating. The one guy kingdom. 24 versus 13.

181
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:49,740
Wait, they're all defecting over here. Why are they all defecting?

182
00:24:49,740 --> 00:25:12,240
Is it because this area is just fucked up? Because it's lava. I can change that.

183
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:41,700
There. And make some cool water. Nice ice cold water. Oh, another human

184
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:51,039
kingdom over here. It's because you gave them a chicken.

185
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:56,130
What, it created a whole civilization? What about... Wait, where are those

186
00:25:56,130 --> 00:26:00,299
frogs? Did they eat all the frogs or something?

187
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:02,140
Wait, how can I see where all the animals are?

188
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:10,880
Statistics about your world. A hundred deaths?

189
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:18,910
What? No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. This is not... I'm not gonna let this...

190
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:27,339
I'm not gonna let this slide. I'm sorry.

191
00:26:27,339 --> 00:26:40,210
Get out of here. That's too much expansion. No, I'm sorry. That's not... I'm sorry.

192
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:52,259
You don't... That's too much expansion. Candy? Create the candy biome.

193
00:26:52,259 --> 00:26:56,740
Should I just make candy island over here? Okay, I'm gonna make candy island over here.

194
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:07,089
Oh, wait, should I just put a bunch of candy... Wait, okay. So this

195
00:27:07,089 --> 00:27:14,559
candy over here. Corrupted seeds. Mushroom seeds. Grass seeds.

196
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:22,930
Let's make them fight for this island. I mean, it already was grass, but let's make

197
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:35,900
it really, really just like nice and lush.

198
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:41,299
They're persevering.

199
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:53,599
Is the orc actually gonna be able to kill the bear? No.

200
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:58,400
Oh, wait a minute. This is probably a bad idea. Oh,

201
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:06,190
all right. Get rid of this. This is enough of this. I just want to make it a

202
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:11,859
little harder for them. Cad Till has become the biggest kingdom

203
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:15,809
and the one guy kingdom. Wait, where's the actual one guy? How many kids do you

204
00:28:15,809 --> 00:28:31,980
have? 39? Holy shit, dude. Every...

205
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:40,750
Wait, that's kind of fucked up. Doesn't that imply

206
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:45,099
that... Wait, how is it possible that you've had 38

207
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:58,210
children and there's 38 people here? I don't know. I think I have to get a

208
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:05,140
tornado. From the other kingdom? Uh-oh, we're gonna

209
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:13,859
fight here. Are they gonna go for it? Are they going for it? The orcs

210
00:29:13,859 --> 00:29:20,289
over here are scattered. They're not preparing.

211
00:29:20,289 --> 00:29:30,589
No, they back down. Wait, where they... Where they going?

212
00:29:30,589 --> 00:29:39,329
Uh-oh, they're getting an army ready over here too.

213
00:29:39,329 --> 00:29:54,240
Dude, what's with all the lightning? They're kind of just hanging out.

214
00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:02,819
Oh, all right. Check this out. Let's make this whole thing fucking awful.

215
00:30:02,819 --> 00:30:10,029
Fruit bushes right in the middle. Good luck. Fight over the bushes.

216
00:30:10,029 --> 00:30:24,980
Amuse me. Fight over these fruit bushes. Amuse me.

217
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:33,789
Come on, you're just gonna... Uh-oh, a deco... Wait, what is this person doing?

218
00:30:33,789 --> 00:30:43,519
They... Oh, now that they're part of this place.

219
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:56,529
38 children. Is that even... Like, I feel like at some point it's just 236%

220
00:30:56,529 --> 00:31:09,759
full hunger that's gonna get ugly over here. Who's got the biggest kingdom?

221
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:28,180
77. They've been very busy. Villages? Cultures? Force kingdom to start a war.

222
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:32,849
When used on a village, that's not a capital. It becomes its own kingdom.

223
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:39,950
All right, I'm curious about this. Let's take a look. 11 houses, 16 people in the

224
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:50,349
army. 27... How did... Who died? Okay, so this is the leader of this village.

225
00:31:50,349 --> 00:32:06,960
They have no children. They get in boats. Oh, he got killed by a bear. That's right.

226
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:23,980
No battles. Okay. Still no fight yet. What about a dog? You guys... Who should get the

227
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:41,789
dogs? You can all have... Okay, you can all have three dogs. Weird building pattern.

228
00:32:41,789 --> 00:32:56,109
They kind of came back strong though. You guys... Let's put a few... A couple of cows.

229
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:14,210
Um... Wait, I can make enemies? All right, who should deal with the first... Who should deal

230
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:25,730
with the first group of, uh, like, attacking bandits? Oh my god, there's so much more that

231
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:41,460
I didn't see. A dragon? UFO? Beehive? Make Monster Island. All right, hold on. First,

232
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:47,069
I'm gonna make... We need to make somebody... A village has to get attacked by bandits.

233
00:33:47,069 --> 00:34:01,170
Make Dragon Island. This thing is scary. All right, who is the most progressed?

234
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:18,429
It's either... You... You... You Boredran? E.S. or Ostod? Who needs a challenge here? E.S.?

235
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:26,369
I can check. Yeah, let's... Let's see who could use a challenge. Statistics. What about your world?

236
00:34:26,369 --> 00:34:35,650
Oh, no. World laws? Kingdoms can declare wars and treaties. Yeah. Cities can rebel when

237
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:40,980
have low loyalty. So that's what we've seen. Kingdoms will send settlers to establish new

238
00:34:41,059 --> 00:34:49,650
villages. They have armies. Allows the stealing of borders. Babies will be born. Everyone needs

239
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:55,360
food to live and creatures can die of old age. Baby animals can be born. Animals can randomly spawn.

240
00:34:55,360 --> 00:35:20,500
Okay. So... World history. Demons from another realm have invaded this world. What? Since when?

241
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:35,460
Uh-oh. I didn't have to do anything. This thing has almost six... It's six hundred health? All

242
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:40,159
right, let's see. Here you go. You guys can have, like, a bunch of chickens and, like, two cows.

243
00:35:40,639 --> 00:36:02,110
And let's, like, bless them with water. Here. Have some, like, grass seeds. This... They're looking

244
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:13,309
at each other from over... Okay. So now they can start their entire kingdom over here. They're

245
00:36:13,309 --> 00:36:25,260
already doing machinery. Ah! What's going on here? Nobody in it. Is this a... Is this a diplomatic

246
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:43,460
ambassador of the Demon Kingdom? I don't know. Stone? Uh, let's put some... Actually, you know what?

247
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:53,019
Let's put some stone up here. I feel like they need it. They definitely need it. I just killed,

248
00:36:53,019 --> 00:37:14,849
like, three people. Oops. Fill the hole up here. Now mine this for resources. Plants? All right.

249
00:37:14,849 --> 00:37:36,320
Let's do some plants over here. Lemon seeds on the top of the mountain. Getting close to each other.

250
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:51,760
Hourglass? Change the flow of... Ah! What happened? Baby tornado? What's going on? Why are we all

251
00:37:51,760 --> 00:38:10,429
celebrating? What happened? What are we celebrating? The King Oz of Zagad is dead. Oh, I crushed him

252
00:38:10,429 --> 00:38:26,940
with a rock. Zoom out? Oh. Why is there a tornado kingdom? And why would the whole world celebrate

253
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:44,260
a tornado? Oh, right. Uh-oh. Okay. Favorite units? Oh, I should have favorited the guy that had like

254
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:53,860
40 kids. Can you handle that? I think they have the biggest army.

255
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:12,190
I'm picking favorites here, but it's all right. I'm gonna give it to everybody. Don't worry.

256
00:39:12,829 --> 00:39:36,900
What are you doing? Favorite food? Cider. Mood normal. Children 16. Is this like, um,

257
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:55,900
can you put more plants? I mean, more plants, you think? Should we make it? Let's, let's,

258
00:39:55,900 --> 00:40:03,789
let's heat something up. When do they start killing each other? I don't know. I would imagine

259
00:40:03,789 --> 00:40:13,329
probably soon. There's not much, there's no more, there's nowhere else to go. Okay. Let's put some,

260
00:40:13,329 --> 00:40:24,210
uh, oh, a hot spring. Volcano. Snow! Okay. Let's, let's, let's make some snow. This would be nice.

261
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:54,139
Give him like a winter wonderland. I hear hitting. What's being hit? Oh, they're killing a sheep.

262
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:14,699
All right. Should I drop a, uh, I don't want to drop on it. A heat ray. Robot Santa? Oh,

263
00:41:14,699 --> 00:41:19,860
what about fireworks? Okay. Let's do, let's celebrate the fact that we just had another

264
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:54,579
30 kids. Am I going to light them? What happened? The size is too big. That's all right. I can fix

265
00:41:54,579 --> 00:42:04,670
it. All right. That's, that's my apology. I gave you like six chickens. There's some cooled water.

266
00:42:08,769 --> 00:42:22,340
It's time for war. This gag pond has 40. Oh, they're all here. All right. It looks,

267
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:28,510
I can influence this. Here it comes. I'm thinking about throwing a fireball at some point. Lava.

268
00:42:28,510 --> 00:43:05,139
No. Um, they're getting very close. There's a lot of play out. Poison the water. Uh, they're just

269
00:43:05,139 --> 00:43:15,780
matching each other's speed. Nobody wants to make the first move. They're all peaceful with each

270
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:36,530
other. 45 deaths from hunger. Other deaths. Are they still over there? It's like two. I picked them

271
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:52,530
up. Burning feet, fire, blood, fireproof. Cool. Um, all right. I think this is as big as the world

272
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:58,139
is going to be able to get. Cause I mean, we have so many kingdoms here. It's time to start a little

273
00:43:58,139 --> 00:44:10,289
bit of conflict. What do you think? Like I'm just, okay. I'm just going to put a grenade over here

274
00:44:10,289 --> 00:44:29,650
and it's going to be like, what the hell was that? Right? It's like, what was that? Oh,

275
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:45,699
they're just sitting at the border. Okay. We could make it be, we could speed the time up a

276
00:44:45,699 --> 00:44:56,929
little bit here and see what happens in like a hundred years. Increased. What was it? Times one.

277
00:44:56,929 --> 00:45:07,619
Okay. I could do times two maybe, right? Oh man. All right. What do you, what should I do? Times

278
00:45:07,619 --> 00:45:26,719
five. What does the world look like? Uh, yeah, this is happening now. This is definitely happening.

279
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:36,510
No, fuck you. No, fuck you. No, fuck you. Well, how big is their army?

280
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:41,230
Attack speed. I don't know who's going to, who's going to hit first. You just drank coffee.

281
00:45:41,230 --> 00:46:01,300
Here we go. Here we go. They're getting too close. There it goes. Oh no. They're fighting over,

282
00:46:02,829 --> 00:46:16,420
they're attacking their huts. Just freak them out a little. I am angry. Stop fighting. Holy shit.

283
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:31,019
They wiped them out. They wiped them out completely. Nobody even died here. The one guy kingdom

284
00:46:31,019 --> 00:46:47,489
is now very strong. Absolutely wiped them out. That's bad for you. Let us bet next time. Well,

285
00:46:47,489 --> 00:46:56,539
how about this? Why don't you bet on who reigns completely supreme here? You got, um,

286
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:02,510
I think the dwarves have been wiped out. No, they're not. The dwarves are here. You've got,

287
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:09,650
I don't know. Should we go by kingdom or just humans, dwarves, orcs, or I don't know. But I'm

288
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:15,650
going to be influenced. This is killing a lot of people. All right. Don't vote for these people

289
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:21,949
because the tornado just went through the whole village and I think took out a lot of people.

290
00:47:21,949 --> 00:47:46,369
Oh man. Are they all right? All right. I'm glad I tested that over there because eventually,

291
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:58,219
oh, God's just testing. Um, like this is still going. Just, I want them to make sure they know

292
00:47:58,219 --> 00:48:13,730
what they're dealing with. This little tornado is causing so many problems. All right. It's,

293
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:40,480
we're at, we're at halftime. Everybody gets a dozen chickens. Why is nobody going to Candy

294
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:57,059
Island? It looks like, okay, we can speed up time a little bit now. Relations. These diplomatic

295
00:48:57,059 --> 00:49:14,429
relations with other kingdoms. Death is health. They're militarist. Damn. Okay. War is peace.

296
00:49:14,429 --> 00:49:21,489
Okay. They're at peace with pretty much everybody besides, I'm not worried with anybody. They

297
00:49:21,489 --> 00:49:30,690
already destroyed everybody. Where are you guys? They're currently at peace over here too. Culture

298
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:48,239
level. How many villages this has? Peaceful militarist. Click the light bulb. Research.

299
00:49:50,849 --> 00:50:03,780
Common knowledge is windmill population. Okay. Move over here. All right. Nobody else is at war.

300
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:26,909
We can change that really quickly though. I thought they weren't at war. They're gonna. All

301
00:50:26,909 --> 00:50:35,219
right. I, we got to slow them down. I'm actually going to slow them down a little and then great

302
00:50:35,219 --> 00:50:47,500
heat. What are they doing? Did you guys already, uh, do a poll? I don't remember. What are they

303
00:50:47,500 --> 00:51:06,940
doing over here? What's going on here? Why are they all hanging around the windmill? All right.

304
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:38,670
Let's speed it up. Times five. Nobody decided to go over to the islands. What was going on over here?

305
00:51:38,670 --> 00:52:00,449
Gold mine. Change the laws of the world now. Okay. Okay. Here we go. Natural disasters,

306
00:52:00,449 --> 00:52:05,179
other disasters. Minerals. We need to start some fights. Look at the grayed out options.

307
00:52:05,179 --> 00:52:13,679
Creep tiles like tumor pumpkin biomass would stay even after base structure is gone. Eternal lava.

308
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:40,960
Okay. Make a volcano. Look at the grayed out options. Hold on. Let me see. Peaceful monsters.

309
00:52:42,929 --> 00:52:49,489
A hundred. Limit maximum population of a hundred. Villagers will also participate in insane. Really?

310
00:52:49,489 --> 00:53:18,909
Okay. That's fine. Go up. Hold on a sec. This is as high as, as high as I can go. Kingdom tab. Let's see.

311
00:53:18,909 --> 00:53:44,960
Okay. Is it still snowing over here? Mods are watching Sopranos. Oh, that's all right. So,

312
00:53:44,960 --> 00:54:02,610
let's do, what is this? Under development. Okay. Force a kingdom to war. I think this is probably

313
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:25,659
going to be very hard to beat. Everyone's kind of just chilling. This is fine. I want to speed it

314
00:54:25,659 --> 00:54:38,960
up one more time. Another times five and see what happens. Put on earthbound OST. No, that's all

315
00:54:38,960 --> 00:55:03,059
good. I need to concentrate. Maybe in a minute. All right. It's time. Here we go. Here's my plan.

316
00:55:03,059 --> 00:55:17,099
I want to see. Crabzilla. I feel like Crabzilla is going to end the whole thing. If I, if I click

317
00:55:17,099 --> 00:55:31,619
Crabzilla, this is going to be a disaster. This was not my plan to play this all night, by the way.

318
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:37,980
I just wanted to check it out. I really liked this so far though. It's fun. Just like kind of

319
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:58,400
people watching. Save it. Oh my God. Thank you. Uh, where's the, no, do not quit. There it is.

320
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:07,219
Actually, I want to, I want to see the difference. What's the difference? 14 years versus 85,

321
00:56:07,219 --> 00:56:16,590
four kingdoms, three, two cultures, five, three villages, seven, and then 359 population. Okay.

322
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:24,829
Uh, I'm just, I'm curious. I'm, I'm curious to see what happens here. Let's, let's do something weird.

323
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:41,889
Um, okay. Lava cloud. Robot Santa. Where should robot Santa spawn? How about over here in candy

324
00:56:41,889 --> 00:57:04,719
world? Okay. So what, what are these two Santas? He's not doing anything. Oh, it's for everything.

325
00:57:04,719 --> 00:57:18,340
Right. Okay. Okay. Well, I'm really glad I spawned that over here. Wait, this, look at this. Hold on

326
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:27,519
a second. I have an idea. What am I doing? Just staying over here? Oh, it's cause I can only go

327
00:57:27,519 --> 00:58:08,429
here. Okay. It's forest soil and I put grass. I'll connect it. I'm going to put grass. I'm,

328
00:58:08,429 --> 00:58:15,150
I'm very curious to see what happens here. You can make the world way bigger. That's pretty cool,

329
00:58:15,150 --> 00:58:25,409
but let's see what happens when I do this. Uh, let's make some more elves over here.

330
00:58:25,409 --> 00:58:47,949
Give them a chance. Let's give them a shitload of resources too. Why not? A bunch of water,

331
00:58:47,949 --> 00:59:05,090
bunch of seeds, bunch of mushrooms, a bunch of enchanted seeds, a ton of lemon seeds,

332
00:59:05,090 --> 00:59:11,860
tons of fertilizer. Oops. Bunch of fruit bushes. All right. This is the place to be.

333
00:59:15,889 --> 00:59:39,119
Lemon Island. Animals. I put some already. They're fighting. Okay. Let's see what happens.

334
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:44,300
There was no pole, right? So I can just kind of mess around. Now that we have the world is here.

335
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:58,460
Ooh, they split off. Take a look. How are the demons? The demons have the same three. I'm

336
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:05,179
connecting. Why? They haven't developed any technology. They've just been walking around.

337
01:00:05,179 --> 01:00:15,139
Give the orcs a boss to fight. That's a good idea. All right. The orcs are going to fight

338
01:00:15,139 --> 01:00:28,099
five skeletons. Let's see if they can handle it. They look at how huge they are. Here we go. Ready?

339
01:00:28,739 --> 01:00:38,159
They destroyed it. Oh my God. That wasn't even a... All right. What about a dragon? All right. It's

340
01:00:38,159 --> 01:00:42,659
time for a dragon. We're putting a dragon into the orc kingdom and we're going to put it up in the

341
01:00:42,659 --> 01:01:08,719
corner. Here we go. What is going on? Are these monkeys? Wait, there's monkeys that have made...

342
01:01:11,739 --> 01:01:22,400
It wants nothing to do with the monkeys over there. Why are there so many? I didn't put these here.

343
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:48,800
Oh my goodness. Okay. Get him. Get the dragon. Fight it. What are they even throwing? I actually

344
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:57,920
don't want the kingdom over here to die, so I'm going to help. All right. Now blow it up.

345
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:15,500
Fuck. What happened? Shit. Oh no. Sorry. They can rebuild. They can rebuild. They can rebuild.

346
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:33,809
I got to bless them. I got to help them. No, everyone's fine. They're doing just fine over

347
01:02:33,809 --> 01:02:42,880
here. You better stay the fuck away from Monkey Island. In fact, I don't trust that you won't.

348
01:02:45,119 --> 01:03:06,429
Change the size of the rain. How do I make it bigger? Oh, right. Like this. Ooh. All right.

349
01:03:06,429 --> 01:03:39,840
Let's bless everyone with the cooling, clean, crisp mist. Here we go. Civilization simulator.

350
01:03:39,840 --> 01:04:03,150
All right. How about... People are drowning? Who? What are you talking about? You're stuck in the

351
01:04:03,150 --> 01:04:26,849
wood. You're stuck in the wood age? This is going well over here. They need minerals. Okay. Like

352
01:04:26,849 --> 01:05:11,340
ore. All right. Give the monkeys gold. Yeah. It's a good idea. They deserve it. You know what? Let's

353
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:18,989
put some gold over here too. Let's just give it to everybody. We need to make this a little

354
01:05:18,989 --> 01:05:42,829
more enticing over here. Some mithril. So are they going to start making more advanced things?

355
01:05:42,829 --> 01:06:04,559
Silver. The monkeys don't even care about this. Oh god damn it. Oh, I think I just killed a few

356
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:24,860
people. Stone. You got to get through the demons. All right. Let's pass some time. Let's see what

357
01:06:24,860 --> 01:06:46,420
happens to our civilizations. Curious. Okay. Oh, wait a minute. Something happening over here.

358
01:06:50,510 --> 01:07:00,750
This group in the middle here has gotten really, really a lot of people and they're starting to...

359
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:08,829
Yeah, this is a problem right here. The elves have... The elves are probably going to take it.

360
01:07:08,829 --> 01:07:36,110
We need more metal. Do we need more metal? More ore too. Should I just make ore island? Okay. I'm

361
01:07:36,110 --> 01:08:00,239
going to just make a... I'm going to pick an ore island. Just one piece. No, this is just

362
01:08:00,239 --> 01:08:15,730
developer island. Okay. Stone. I think it's a little smaller. They're already coming over here.

363
01:08:15,730 --> 01:08:26,270
Oh, wait. The demons. The demons can actually make it over here now. Oh, big mistake. They one shot

364
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:33,500
everybody. That's not good. I think that was just the king. Well, stop coming over here. What are

365
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:57,359
you doing? Stop. Why? You know what? Just let them fight. They're slowly just trickling over

366
01:08:57,359 --> 01:09:05,550
here and dying. I don't know why they're just running over here. They're slowly... All right.

367
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:31,569
Why are you still alive? Dude, get out of here. Thank God. I may have just made a big mistake.

368
01:09:31,569 --> 01:09:41,340
Well, that's their army, right? One demon is going through this whole thing. Okay. They got it. A

369
01:09:41,340 --> 01:09:59,630
lot of people died though. Oh, they've made another kingdom. Okay. Let's keep going. All right. This

370
01:09:59,710 --> 01:10:12,930
silver. Let's do ore and then I'm going to speed it up times five and see what happens. No, no,

371
01:10:12,930 --> 01:10:16,689
no. You don't own this. This is, this is developer island. You don't own this.

372
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:35,199
Nobody owns this. Nobody owns this. Stop making a, you're not making a town here.

373
01:10:41,250 --> 01:10:47,949
You're really going to... All right. Who are these people? You're really going to come over

374
01:10:47,949 --> 01:11:05,619
here and claim developer island. Now you've angered me. Holy shit. That's not what I thought that was

375
01:11:05,619 --> 01:11:22,859
going to do, but it worked. Oh, I thought it bounced down. It's okay. It's all good.

376
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:35,489
Stop, stop. You know what? Whatever. Go ahead and claim it. How's monkey island doing?

377
01:11:35,489 --> 01:11:42,479
They're thriving up here. Look at it. Everything's peaceful. Everyone's friends.

378
01:11:42,479 --> 01:11:50,659
It's rhinoceroses and chickens and frogs. They defended it from a dragon. They have growing trees.

379
01:11:50,659 --> 01:12:11,069
They're being sustainable up here. Look at this. I want a little bit more ore. Let's do gold too.

380
01:12:11,390 --> 01:12:28,909
And then adamantite. Okay. We have our ore island and let's do some bushes too. Berries.

381
01:12:28,909 --> 01:12:49,729
Oh, I can't put it there. Why not? Sure. We're like a geyser again. I mean, this is,

382
01:12:49,729 --> 01:12:58,079
wouldn't you want to claim this whole area? If you've got like 10 different civilizations on

383
01:12:58,079 --> 01:13:07,180
earth and all the resources are running out and all of a sudden half a mile off the coast,

384
01:13:07,180 --> 01:13:14,300
the water level drops and there's an island with every valuable resource ever invented,

385
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:28,779
you're going to cause a lot of problems. Okay. Let's speed it up and then we can do some wacky

386
01:13:28,779 --> 01:13:34,899
stuff. They've already, yeah, they already claimed it. The humans. Wait, is it the humans or the

387
01:13:34,899 --> 01:13:40,899
dwarves? I don't know, but this is going to be a fight here. They've already claimed it.

388
01:13:49,630 --> 01:14:00,640
Kingdom lair. Looks like these two are, this one's doing the best. This one's stayed out of most of

389
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:10,850
the conflict. This one stayed pretty much not any fights or anything. These people have been in a

390
01:14:10,850 --> 01:14:15,199
fight. These people obviously have been in a fight. The elves have not really done very much.

391
01:14:22,350 --> 01:14:31,729
Monkey islands doing fine. Wait, monkey islands getting attacked by lightning. Oh no, it's not.

392
01:14:31,729 --> 01:14:51,659
Okay, cool. That's not good. It's happening over here. Which island is mine? I don't know.

393
01:14:51,659 --> 01:15:02,670
They're on the border over here. The other thing that I was going to do today, I wanted to play

394
01:15:02,670 --> 01:15:20,319
pizza tower. I was going to load that up after this. Everybody hates the candy kingdom. Yeah,

395
01:15:20,319 --> 01:15:26,449
I'm surprised. Nobody's, yeah, I think nobody likes it. Let's get some stats here.

396
01:15:26,449 --> 01:15:46,939
520. Infected. Infected. I don't know what that means. Yeah, they claimed it. All right,

397
01:15:46,939 --> 01:15:55,500
let's see what happens. I'm going to do this. Let's see if there is anything. Let me save it

398
01:15:55,500 --> 01:16:05,789
first. I like looking at the progress. It's cool. Let's see. Ready? Yeah. Look at the left and then

399
01:16:05,789 --> 01:16:23,739
all the way to the right. 14, 85, 129. Population slowly increasing. Okay. Uh, try summon the giant

400
01:16:23,739 --> 01:16:48,319
crab. Gray goo? Do crabzilla. Okay. Where should crabzilla spawn? All right. Good luck, everybody.

401
01:16:48,319 --> 01:17:06,829
Wait, I control it? Well, okay. Well, they're all gone. Are you serious? I'm unstoppable.

402
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:22,659
Nobody is going to stop me. I'm sorry. That's how would they ever deal with this?

403
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:49,220
Can I be killed? Okay. All right. Oh, I didn't, I didn't think that was going to happen. Sorry.

404
01:17:49,220 --> 01:17:56,850
Uh, a-otade. Sorry. Almost all of the earth. They already took almost all the resources.

405
01:17:56,850 --> 01:18:25,470
What about here? Lava cloud. I'm curious. One person. One person. It's just like,

406
01:18:25,470 --> 01:18:38,670
holy shit. I don't even know what just happened, but I will rebuild. Good luck.

407
01:18:38,670 --> 01:18:54,050
That's determination right there. All right. What else can I do here? How about, um, earthquake?

408
01:18:54,050 --> 01:19:20,479
Where should I do it? Oh my goodness. Damn. Okay. Hey, make a hot climate up here. Infinity coin.

409
01:19:20,479 --> 01:19:41,180
Meteor eat ray. Really guys? Really? Now, now you decide to go in after all that.

410
01:19:44,670 --> 01:19:50,899
Was this seen as an opportunity of weakness where a bunch of this got wiped out? So they're like,

411
01:19:50,899 --> 01:20:03,939
all right, well, let's go in. That's kind of messed up. They have flaming swords. They're

412
01:20:03,939 --> 01:20:08,560
running now. Like, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out. Wait. No, no, no, no, no, no.

413
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:14,800
Now it's actual constant total conflict. Everybody. Okay. The everybody's just fight.

414
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:25,300
Everybody's just attacking each other. I don't even know who is it. Wait, I need to see the map.

415
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:33,859
That the kingdom map thing. Ooh, it's pretty splintered. They're trying to take this. They're

416
01:20:33,859 --> 01:20:53,260
not going to get it. Especially when a cloud of acid rains. Now they didn't get it. That's a very,

417
01:20:55,470 --> 01:21:07,180
oh my goodness. That's loud. Why is this as a typewriter?

418
01:21:15,020 --> 01:21:44,260
Everything is wow. This person is very big. All right. Stop, stop typewriter ring. They don't

419
01:21:44,260 --> 01:21:56,430
even care. I got it saved. So don't worry. We're good. What about this? What's gray goo?

420
01:22:16,210 --> 01:22:28,210
I didn't want to do. Okay. Oh my God. It's eating the whole place. What are they going to do?

421
01:22:28,210 --> 01:22:55,279
Why are this person so big? Oh Jesus. Oh my goodness. How do I stop it? How do you stop it?

422
01:22:55,279 --> 01:23:04,460
How do I stop it? I didn't want to. Okay. That's not what I wanted to do. That's, I wanted to,

423
01:23:04,460 --> 01:23:10,270
you said, I didn't know it was going to be that big. I didn't know it was going to be that big.

424
01:23:10,270 --> 01:23:26,500
Water? Dude, water is not going to stop this. How do I stop it? You can't stop the gray goo event.

425
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:34,619
No, no, not monkey Island. Anything but monkey Island. Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop, stop. Pause.

426
01:23:34,619 --> 01:24:16,989
Oh my goodness. Escape route. No, no, stop. Stop. I'm trying to save. I'm trying to save somebody.

427

Is there anybody left? No, you don't understand. Go over this way. You don't get it. There's one

01:24:29,729 --> 01:24:38,140
other rhino that you guys need to make friends right now. Well, wait. Okay. At least we have.

433
01:26:11,380 --> 01:26:19,060
