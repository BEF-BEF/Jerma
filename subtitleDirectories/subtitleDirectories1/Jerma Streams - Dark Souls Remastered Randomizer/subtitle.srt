1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:18,379
Hello. How are you? I'll wait until you say good. Good. Good. Bad. Why? What's the best chat color?

2
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:31,940
Um, I'm more of a prehensical myself. That light kind of pale orange color.

3
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:47,460
Somebody said, uh, awful. That color sucks. That color's fine. Oh wait, wait, wait. Can you change

4
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:56,969
your color? Can you guys all make your colors orange? Wait, have I had the same color

5
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:06,200
for like five years on Twitch? I have, haven't I? I've only been this lime green forever.

6
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:16,120
I've never changed color. I thought that just meant I was the streamer. I think that I could,

7
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:24,219
how do I change it? I don't think I want to. It's been that lime green since I made this

8
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:40,180
account. What a revelation I'm getting right now. Now it's too recognizable. Yeah, I'm just the

9
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:55,260
green guy. How am I doing? I'm doing pretty good. I'm just hanging up. I forgot you could

10
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:59,739
change color. I didn't think you could. I don't know why, because people, I don't know,

11
00:01:59,739 --> 00:02:03,260
I thought it was just, I thought it was every new account you could change color.

12
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:18,229
I don't know. How do I do it? I'm scared though, because I'm, okay, I'm clicking on

13
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:23,500
the chat. I'm scrolling around. I see emotes. Where's the change color button?

14
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:34,280
Chat settings. Edit appearance? I feel like it's going to crash my account.

15
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:40,120
I've been green for too long. Nah, okay, I know where it is. All right, that's fine.

16
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:47,060
Anyways, today we're going to do Dark Souls remastered, except not the regular Dark Souls

17
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:55,449
remastered. We're doing Dark Souls remastered randomizer. Got a lot of requests to do this

18
00:02:55,449 --> 00:02:59,129
over the last few months or so, the last six months or so, people have really

19
00:03:00,169 --> 00:03:07,300
been talking about this. This is going to randomize, and I can set the parameters. I have

20
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:14,810
it, I have it pretty basic right now. This is randomizing every item in the game. This

21
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:25,180
randomize every enemy in the game. I think I'm going to have random armor on and a random

22
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:38,729
enemy. I can also change it to be every single enemy can be one enemy, so I can actually just

23
00:03:38,729 --> 00:03:45,590
fight. Well, I don't want to spoil it, because it's something I want to do. Dermot lied about

24
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:51,639
the clown car. He's going to be changing his name at some point over the summer,

25
00:03:53,219 --> 00:04:00,979
but thank you for the five community subs. Appreciate it. All pinwheels. Well, don't ruin

26
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:07,370
the joke already. There's a couple of different playthroughs I want to do here.

27
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:17,910
I'm going to try... how hard do you think that would be to play through the whole game against

28
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:28,009
pinwheel? Every enemy, every boss is pinwheel. Do you think I could do that in two hours?

29
00:04:28,649 --> 00:04:42,439
I kind of just have to run to the end, right? Anyways, it's ready. Hopefully the game

30
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:52,069
doesn't break, because I have random enemies and random items. They're going to keep

31
00:04:52,069 --> 00:05:00,920
cloning themselves, so it's going to be kind of hard. Make every enemy a wheel skeleton.

32
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:10,339
Look, my goal here is to see if I can get to the first boss. How random? Everything is random.

33
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:21,160
Just to test it, I made it so bosses can't randomly just spawn in. Everything else is

34
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,800
completely random. I can change that, but I just wanted to see if this works, because I

35
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:31,449
didn't really want to test it because I didn't want to see it. We can go back and fix that.

36
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:43,959
There's a lot to do. But anyways, welcome everybody. Let's get started. I'm going to do new game.

37
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:56,360
Already have stuff. What do I have? What is that? Oh, it's best shield in the game?

38
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:15,560
All right. I don't even know what this stuff is. You're in the chef costume. Brand... oh yeah,

39
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:22,600
random name. Right, yeah, random name. That's true. What am I thinking? I can't do this shit.

40
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:31,319
Random name. Is there a name generator online? Random name generator. There has to be one of

41
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:45,819
these. Random name generator. This website can suggest names for babies. Why would you

42
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:54,810
fucking have a random website generate your baby's name? Okay, I'm just going to do

43
00:06:54,810 --> 00:07:08,790
generate name. First, first name only. A masculine first name. Random. Generate a life story.

44
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:19,910
What the fuck is this website? I can generate a life story? Okay, I'm going for it. Okay,

45
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:31,910
so I've got, uh, Waldemar Manfredi, masculine, elderly, adult, nationality, German, from Bavaria,

46
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:47,779
aged 84, physical, 5'9", right-handed, blood O-type, and is gonna die by heart disease

47
00:07:47,779 --> 00:07:52,819
in less than like six years. This character's like dead. All right, Waldemar Manfredi.

48
00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:21,740
Okay, uh, class, uh, randomized. Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

49
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:37,480
what's going on here? What? Oh, it's, oh yeah, it's random. The bandit? What is that? I don't

50
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:51,460
think I've ever even seen that item in the game. Two swords? There's another giant hammer?

51
00:08:56,009 --> 00:09:16,700
I mean, look at that bandit hammer though. I'm going for bandit. Gift.

52
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:30,019
Binoculars. No, no, no, this is important. Uh, fire bomb. Physique. I feel like, is that

53
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:53,100
random? Tiny head. Just make him a pear. I kind of like the pear. Face. All right, here we go.

54
00:09:54,059 --> 00:10:32,659
We have to do random, right? Is there a way I can just do random? All right, I just took a

55
00:10:32,659 --> 00:10:44,460
picture of my face every day for 10 years. That's just one of these YouTube videos. I

56
00:10:44,460 --> 00:11:01,980
didn't have it on different. Oh, wait, wait. Oops. I don't know when to stop. All right,

57
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:06,700
I'm going to do 30 more times. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,

58
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:11,340
17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. No, I already had a blue person. I

59
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:23,929
had a blue character before. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,

60
00:11:23,929 --> 00:11:29,529
12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.

61
00:11:29,529 --> 00:12:05,669
This is a sunburned dad. No, that's fine. That's good to me. Yeah, that looks good to

62
00:12:05,669 --> 00:12:21,129
me. I'm ready. I'm ready to test it. You ready for the test? Start the game with this

63
00:12:21,129 --> 00:12:25,879
character. Here we go. It's going to be loud. You can't turn down cutscenes. Turn your volume

64
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:35,620
down. You guys have seen this cutscene a fucking hundred times. What is that?

65
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:49,220
It's a bush. Who's in there?

66
00:12:49,860 --> 00:13:01,879
And in this land, the undead are caught.

67
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:19,879
Are those crystal lizards? Here I am. So what is this weapon?

68
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:21,720
This is your fate.

69
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:33,190
Okay, I would have laughed so hard if that randomized that rat or something.

70
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,830
I can't remember how to play this game. It's been a long time.

71
00:13:46,620 --> 00:14:02,139
Thank you. Look at that beef jerky. Slim Jim. All right, here we go.

72
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:07,179
Dungeon cell key. I thought it was supposed to be random items.

73
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:32,279
It's okay. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. What is that? What is that? Sif?

74
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:47,000
This is too much. I thought I made it so it couldn't do this.

75
00:14:47,799 --> 00:15:12,919
Just give me my weapon. Wait, that's a boss. Oh, oh, right. That's the asylum demon.

76
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:17,320
I'm so confused. Oh, it's just. Look at how laggy this is.

77
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:29,159
How am I going to be able to beat Sif at level zero? Does he still come to the same place?

78
00:15:29,879 --> 00:16:02,700
Where is he? Oh, what? Can he not come down? Do I have a bow and arrow?

79
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:09,539
Hold on. I think I can get him. Can I get him from the other side?

80
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:27,539
Because the asylum demon jumps down, I guess. Go for the egg thing.

81
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,070
Oh my god. Hold on. Those things are late game, aren't they?

82
00:16:32,789 --> 00:16:39,379
I can't even equip my thing yet. Okay, hold on.

83
00:16:40,019 --> 00:17:06,900
These things are easy. I don't remember. Blacksmith giant hammer.

84
00:17:07,539 --> 00:17:15,269
I gotta put that on right now. Hold on. Insufficient strength to wield this.

85
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,539
This thing sucks. Why did you guys tell me to get this?

86
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:57,900
Give me the Estus. Is it actually good? Okay, thanks.

87
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,190
Take this off. I'm not even going to use it. All right, so hold on.

88
00:18:03,829 --> 00:18:10,819
Let me see the stats here. I have to go actually into my equipment.

89
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:28,019
Do I? No. 237. That's actually pretty good. Minus 83.

90
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:30,259
I need 16 strength to hold it in one hand.

91
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:42,900
That's like mankind off the fucking top of the cage.

92
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:52,220
Somebody's dead. How the hell are you a normal enemy?

93
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,670
Actually, is this an electric divide? The shield is actually good.

94
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:03,450
Keep the shield on. Is it? Oh, it's the grass crest shield.

95
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:08,920
Yeah, right. Why is it? Okay, cool. This is the stamina one.

96
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:19,589
I forgot about this thing. Oh, Jesus Christ.

97
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:31,049
I gotta fight the Capra demon up here? That's not gonna happen.

98
00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:33,690
I have to reload this and redo the randomization.

99
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:48,470
I fucking hate fat rolling. Drink something quick.

100
00:19:54,019 --> 00:20:08,470
I can't even fucking move. I'm taking off all my armor.

101
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:15,900
I can kill this guy. Let's go. I got this.

102
00:20:16,539 --> 00:20:38,150
Now that I can actually maneuver around. Let's go.

103
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:45,319
What? All right, let's go Capra. Firebomb.

104
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,630
I feel like these should all be randomized too.

105
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:55,059
I think the whole thing should be. All right, let's go Capra demon.

106
00:20:55,059 --> 00:20:59,099
Where'd he go? Where the hell is he?

107
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:10,490
Where did the Capra... Am I losing my mind?

108
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:11,369
Where the fuck did he go?

109
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:16,069
You pre-recorded stream not wearing hat.

110
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:34,779
All right, settle down. 389 damage.

111
00:21:35,339 --> 00:21:45,940
There's another rat in here. This is doing so much damage.

112
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:53,210
I think the asylum is toned down so you can actually get out.

113
00:21:53,210 --> 00:22:12,789
But can I get out? What?

114
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:15,930
Oh, what? I thought it was Sif.

115
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:19,609
What is happening? I'm so confused right now.

116
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:31,609
Stop doing the same move. He's dead.

117
00:22:32,579 --> 00:22:38,809
All right, wait. Sif was the other one.

118
00:22:38,809 --> 00:22:40,569
All right, for the one that you can fall down.

119
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:44,059
Right, right, right. Okay. Nice.

120
00:22:44,859 --> 00:22:59,079
This thing is pretty good. This is so stupid.

121
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:06,700
And you've doubted us. I don't know why. Why would I ever doubt you guys?

122
00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:20,390
I really hope it's like Gwyn flying over here to pick me up.

123
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:23,589
No, that's too bad.

124
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:44,650
How long am I gonna do this for?

125
00:23:45,529 --> 00:23:48,329
Until I get to a point where it is no longer feasible.

126
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:55,289
And then I'm gonna go absolute psycho mode.

127
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:01,190
This is essentially just the test to make sure it's possible.

128
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,549
And then we do it again.

129
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:23,019
You're gonna get over-encumbered in 10 minutes.

130
00:24:23,019 --> 00:24:23,819
No, I'll be all right.

131
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,599
Tiny being's ring. What's the tiny being's ring?

132
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:46,250
I'll take it. Let's go. I'm ready.

133
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:49,319
Let's go fight the gold guy.

134
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:58,680
This is like a storyline DLC guy, isn't it?

135
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,039
1500. Guys, if we get some...

136
00:25:07,259 --> 00:25:08,460
Oh, Jesus Christ.

137
00:25:26,019 --> 00:25:27,140
It's the phone column.

138
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,119
Oh, wait. Will he fall off the edge?

139
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:37,079
He's stupid, right? He's too big to be over here.

140
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:38,519
He'll fall off if he swings this way.

141
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:52,710
Oh, great. They're all just single file coming down this way.

142
00:25:57,339 --> 00:25:58,299
Oh, Jesus.

143
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,819
Watch out for the mushroom. Watch out for the mushroom. Watch out.

144
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:13,700
Slowly the phone column is making its way over here.

145
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:28,599
God. And you wonder why I didn't turn bosses on initially.

146
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:29,319
This is hell.

147
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:34,440
Holy shit. I thought I just got one punched.

148
00:26:35,579 --> 00:26:36,859
That was really close.

149
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,910
It's like that was a...

150
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:45,349
I wouldn't have paid for that pay-per-view.

151
00:26:45,349 --> 00:26:46,390
I would have wanted my money back.

152
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:00,970
Okay, we're fine.

153
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:04,170
Got it.

154
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:12,680
I'm just gonna go level up again.

155
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,200
Why wouldn't I? Just wait.

156
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,710
Oh, gold pine risen.

157
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:17,509
Nice. All right, hold on.

158
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:30,650
Just a shit... an absolute shit lot of vitality.

159
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:33,980
All right, I'm taking on the fucking golden guy up here.

160
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:38,950
They will respawn.

161
00:27:40,309 --> 00:27:41,029
That's right.

162
00:27:41,829 --> 00:27:42,869
I forgot.

163
00:27:43,509 --> 00:27:45,589
I forgot what game I was playing.

164
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:49,589
Oh, god damn it, man.

165
00:27:49,589 --> 00:27:51,589
Like that... this is gonna be impossible.

166
00:27:51,589 --> 00:27:52,470
I'm gonna have to just run.

167
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,740
A hundred and eleven.

168
00:27:57,299 --> 00:27:57,539
Bye.

169
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:01,660
What the fuck?

170
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,460
What is that?

171
00:28:03,019 --> 00:28:06,230
Hold on. Every item is randomized, so I have to try to get them.

172
00:28:06,789 --> 00:28:12,970
Hello?

173
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:16,789
You can't... you cannot come over here, can you?

174
00:28:16,789 --> 00:28:17,910
There's no way he can come over here.

175
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:24,089
Do I not get...

176
00:28:24,089 --> 00:28:26,089
Okay, I was gonna say, do I not get the souls?

177
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,160
Miracle great heal and twin humanities.

178
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,519
What's the other ring that I just picked up?

179
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:39,450
Boost curse resistance.

180
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:40,410
Just put it on.

181
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:42,259
Might as well just have it on.

182
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:44,650
All right.

183
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:45,769
This is the safe zone here.

184
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,059
Okay.

185
00:28:54,230 --> 00:29:00,009
I... I forgot that it's not left button.

186
00:29:00,009 --> 00:29:00,730
It's not... hold on.

187
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:01,369
Just listen to me.

188
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:05,289
You have to... you have to tap dodge again.

189
00:29:05,289 --> 00:29:07,450
I was clicking in left stick.

190
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:10,759
It doesn't matter.

191
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:12,119
I'll be fine.

192
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:21,660
He dropped an item down there, though.

193
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:24,470
I don't care.

194
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:25,029
Fuck it.

195
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:25,670
What am I gonna go?

196
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:26,630
Collect all that shit?

197
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:26,869
No.

198
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,140
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

199
00:29:35,019 --> 00:29:41,180
Dragon scale and a sorcerer's catalyst.

200
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:48,970
Okay, hold on.

201
00:29:50,579 --> 00:29:52,180
The items... I have to pick them up.

202
00:29:58,279 --> 00:29:59,960
Chester's long coat.

203
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:12,279
Hold on.

204
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:12,920
Damn.

205
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,640
I'll put this on.

206
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:16,299
It's mid roll, sorry.

207
00:30:17,019 --> 00:30:30,059
That's not gonna do anything.

208
00:30:38,059 --> 00:30:43,480
I can't even cross the bridge.

209
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:53,460
I just gotta run.

210
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:56,549
There's no way you're gonna be able to do that.

211
00:30:56,549 --> 00:30:57,109
You have to run.

212
00:30:57,829 --> 00:30:58,549
You gotta get to...

213
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,349
Killing one of these things is 5,000 souls.

214
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:13,019
Out of my way.

215
00:31:13,019 --> 00:31:18,900
Just run to the bonfire.

216
00:31:19,539 --> 00:31:21,099
I should be fine.

217
00:31:22,059 --> 00:31:25,579
I gotta maneuver my way.

218
00:31:25,579 --> 00:31:26,380
Maybe go up top?

219
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,220
You motherfucker.

220
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:32,839
Oh, you dick.

221
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:33,240
How did you...

222
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,519
Why would you even be coming down here?

223
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:56,839
I have to kill him.

224
00:31:56,839 --> 00:32:03,380
Just let him despawn.

225
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,259
Let him go all the way back.

226
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:07,880
Just go back.

227
00:32:16,259 --> 00:32:17,460
This is the remastered version.

228
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:19,269
Lose you that of curious.

229
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,099
Got it.

230
00:32:25,099 --> 00:32:25,740
Alright, I'm fine.

231
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,450
Alright, good.

232
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:40,119
What?

233
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:40,359
Who?

234
00:32:43,369 --> 00:32:44,250
I don't know what that was.

235
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:45,369
I don't know what's in the wall.

236
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:49,740
It's a giant rat.

237
00:32:52,309 --> 00:32:52,630
I got...

238
00:32:56,309 --> 00:32:57,109
No, dude.

239
00:32:57,109 --> 00:32:57,829
You can't.

240
00:32:58,549 --> 00:32:59,349
You can't.

241
00:32:59,349 --> 00:33:00,390
This is just...

242
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:01,670
This is comedy only.

243
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:03,430
Because how am I gonna be able to fight Yhorm?

244
00:33:04,309 --> 00:33:05,190
Whatever his name is.

245
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:09,529
This is...

246
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:09,769
That...

247
00:33:09,769 --> 00:33:10,490
It's in the way.

248
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:13,400
Oh, god.

249
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:21,930
Okay, I'm good.

250
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:22,329
I gotta go...

251
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:27,190
Just get to the bonfire.

252
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,099
I'm gonna go get him.

253
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,059
It's my turn now.

254
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,299
I just wish he's blobbing in the way.

255
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:44,200
I can't get by this.

256
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,599
Is there a sec...

257
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:51,720
Is there another way I can go?

258
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,519
Can I jump off the fucking side?

259
00:33:58,779 --> 00:34:00,220
Oh, how did you get by?

260
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:00,460
What?

261
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,579
How did the fat guy get by?

262
00:34:07,029 --> 00:34:07,670
Relentless.

263
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,429
They're fucking relentless.

264
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:10,389
Alright.

265
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,119
I'm gonna...

266
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,159
I think I can run around.

267
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:16,440
I'm gonna try to run around them.

268
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:23,960
I'm pretty sure I can get around that phalanx thing.

269
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,519
Whatever it is.

270
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:34,280
Just go up to the catacombs.

271
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,559
You know, that's not a bad idea.

272
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:38,619
I could also hold on.

273
00:34:38,619 --> 00:34:39,739
I could also go down too.

274
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:40,300
Hold on.

275
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:40,860
Wait a minute.

276
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:43,659
Let me go through the graveyard.

277
00:34:55,849 --> 00:34:56,650
Is he gonna die?

278
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:05,190
Alright.

279
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:06,469
Can I go up here?

280
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:08,650
I'm trying to remember Dark Souls.

281
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:09,449
I remember this guy.

282
00:35:09,449 --> 00:35:10,010
And then I remember...

283
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,449
There's an elevator up here.

284
00:35:11,449 --> 00:35:12,170
So I can't do this yet.

285
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:12,730
I don't think, right?

286
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,780
No, I need to activate the elevator.

287
00:35:22,659 --> 00:35:23,300
Check for the items.

288
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:23,539
Oh, yeah.

289
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:23,780
That's right.

290
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,739
There's items and shit.

291
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,460
Well, that's Astora's straight sword.

292
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,739
Isn't that thing one of the best...

293
00:35:31,739 --> 00:35:34,380
That's one of the best short swords in the game, isn't it?

294
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,070
Well, I'm gonna work towards that.

295
00:35:46,389 --> 00:35:47,510
I'll keep on the hammer for now.

296
00:35:48,469 --> 00:35:48,789
Alright.

297
00:35:48,789 --> 00:35:49,989
Now I can go down.

298
00:35:49,989 --> 00:35:50,389
What's the thing?

299
00:35:50,389 --> 00:35:50,710
Where is he?

300
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:51,349
You can go down.

301
00:35:52,309 --> 00:35:53,980
There's like a...

302
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,260
There's a couple of chests, right?

303
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:55,659
Over here.

304
00:35:58,619 --> 00:35:59,980
It's not good in Dark Souls 1.

305
00:36:12,519 --> 00:36:13,559
Guardian soul.

306
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,159
And the hammer of Vamos.

307
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:24,630
Really?

308
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:24,949
Really?

309
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:29,079
Should I just get fucking like 20,000 souls?

310
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:33,590
Let me see that hammer.

311
00:36:41,349 --> 00:36:42,630
C scaling and strength.

312
00:36:43,429 --> 00:36:47,190
And it's a one-handed hammer.

313
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:47,989
So this is better.

314
00:36:54,219 --> 00:36:54,699
Is it worse?

315
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,699
With better strength though, wouldn't it be?

316
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,550
Oh, what?

317
00:37:01,829 --> 00:37:02,230
You're right.

318
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:02,710
It is worse.

319
00:37:11,699 --> 00:37:14,260
Dark hand and crystal greatsword.

320
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:17,559
This is so overwhelming.

321
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:25,739
Should I just use the crystal greatsword?

322
00:37:25,739 --> 00:37:26,860
That doesn't break, don't they?

323
00:37:32,219 --> 00:37:32,940
Dark hand?

324
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,079
What?

325
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:49,320
This is 200 damage?

326
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,840
I'm gonna try it.

327
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:56,090
I didn't want this in my chest, right?

328
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:56,650
No.

329
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:59,849
There's one over here.

330
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:03,829
Well, there it is, guys.

331
00:38:04,389 --> 00:38:05,179
There it is.

332
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:06,780
You got what you wanted.

333
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:21,139
Come on, get it.

334
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:32,710
Oh, I don't know if I want to use this thing.

335
00:38:32,949 --> 00:38:33,989
I need to parry you.

336
00:38:33,989 --> 00:38:43,500
That's it?

337
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,139
25?

338
00:38:44,139 --> 00:38:45,179
No, no, no, no.

339
00:38:45,179 --> 00:38:45,980
He's dead.

340
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:46,699
The dark hand.

341
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,219
This thing's actually pretty good for a parry.

342
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,039
I'm gonna drop.

343
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:55,179
Why does he not do anything?

344
00:38:55,179 --> 00:38:59,940
I'm still confused at what that does.

345
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,320
Why is there a house cat over here?

346
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:14,579
Is that just a scaled up house cat?

347
00:39:22,659 --> 00:39:23,860
Oh my god.

348
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,980
That was fucking scary.

349
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,000
It's just dogs and cats.

350
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:29,800
They don't even attack.

351
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,599
He's not even gonna attack.

352
00:39:33,739 --> 00:39:35,980
Don't even tell me he's gonna throw that ball.

353
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,840
What is he doing?

354
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:43,289
He's just placing balls.

355
00:39:43,289 --> 00:39:44,329
Is there a hole?

356
00:39:44,329 --> 00:39:45,610
I don't see a hole there.

357
00:39:53,139 --> 00:39:55,179
He's just dropping them.

358
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:10,389
Don't hurt the cat.

359
00:40:10,389 --> 00:40:11,349
You said free souls.

360
00:40:21,909 --> 00:40:22,630
What?

361
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:23,670
I need the soul.

362
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:24,230
All right, fine.

363
00:40:27,829 --> 00:40:29,510
Look, I'll cast an energy spell to heal.

364
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,030
I'll get this role playing heal spell.

365
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:42,809
What?

366
00:40:42,809 --> 00:40:45,500
Hey, easy.

367
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:47,380
Easy.

368
00:40:47,380 --> 00:41:04,789
Slow down.

369
00:41:04,789 --> 00:41:06,150
Go this way.

370
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:10,300
Move this way.

371
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,019
No, move.

372
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:36,409
Is that an NPC?

373
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:49,820
Oh, it's a painted guardian, right?

374
00:41:50,539 --> 00:42:00,139
What is sprinting over here?

375
00:42:00,139 --> 00:42:00,699
It's one of...

376
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:02,570
I'm back.

377
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:03,530
It's me, the kitty.

378
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:07,099
Oh shit.

379
00:42:07,099 --> 00:42:07,820
He's getting closer.

380
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:08,380
He's getting closer.

381
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:08,860
He's getting closer.

382
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:09,260
I gotta move.

383
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:15,849
Can this not...

384
00:42:15,849 --> 00:42:16,809
I can't hurt this, right?

385
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:18,840
Listen.

386
00:42:19,659 --> 00:42:21,500
Oh, that's what that sound is.

387
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:21,820
All right.

388
00:42:22,539 --> 00:42:23,500
I need to get in there though.

389
00:42:24,059 --> 00:42:37,429
This is so dumb.

390
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:39,139
Okay.

391
00:42:40,119 --> 00:42:41,960
So I got dingy gloves.

392
00:42:42,679 --> 00:42:44,920
Purple moss clump.

393
00:42:46,329 --> 00:42:47,130
Really?

394
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:55,300
I can't really help you.

395
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,739
You're locked in here.

396
00:42:56,739 --> 00:42:57,940
There's nowhere for you to really go.

397
00:43:00,389 --> 00:43:02,550
Don't push me off the fucking edge, you punk.

398
00:43:03,269 --> 00:43:04,550
If one of us is going, it's going to be you.

399
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:07,440
Oh.

400
00:43:09,769 --> 00:43:10,090
Move.

401
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:10,889
Just fall off.

402
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:24,659
Move.

403
00:43:24,659 --> 00:43:27,960
It's not going to move.

404
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:28,440
There it goes.

405
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:37,690
I actually can't get out of here.

406
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:52,619
No, there we go.

407
00:43:52,619 --> 00:43:53,260
Okay.

408
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:54,059
Now let's...

409
00:43:54,059 --> 00:43:54,619
Don't...

410
00:43:54,619 --> 00:43:55,579
Did you even think about it?

411
00:43:55,579 --> 00:43:56,079
Okay.

412
00:43:56,619 --> 00:43:58,699
I want to go investigate the guy dropping the rocks.

413
00:44:00,099 --> 00:44:01,139
This is really important.

414
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:14,489
Wait, I can't pick up the...

415
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,079
Does he fight?

416
00:44:17,079 --> 00:44:18,119
I thought he just drops rocks.

417
00:44:18,679 --> 00:44:32,699
I don't think he fights.

418
00:44:32,699 --> 00:44:35,099
I think his AI is only to pick up and drop rocks.

419
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:35,659
Free souls.

420
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:49,300
He's friendly.

421
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:49,860
Sorry.

422
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:51,699
He was doing the equivalent of gardening.

423
00:44:51,699 --> 00:44:53,380
But that's like 10,000 souls.

424
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:56,409
Yeah, that's a lot.

425
00:44:56,409 --> 00:44:57,530
Red titanite chunk too.

426
00:44:58,329 --> 00:45:04,829
Shit.

427
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:09,849
Is it two black knights?

428
00:45:14,409 --> 00:45:15,449
I got to go level up.

429
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:18,630
Just take the items and run.

430
00:45:19,269 --> 00:45:21,769
Oh, just get one.

431
00:45:21,769 --> 00:45:22,489
Just get one.

432
00:45:22,489 --> 00:45:23,210
I'm not going to...

433
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:23,690
I won't live.

434
00:45:24,409 --> 00:45:31,989
This is the Uchi Katana.

435
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:39,210
No, not worth it.

436
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:39,449
Go.

437
00:45:39,449 --> 00:45:39,949
Get out.

438
00:45:40,349 --> 00:45:47,739
All right.

439
00:45:47,739 --> 00:45:48,380
Time to level up.

440
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:52,599
I could go down.

441
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:53,400
No, it's too risky.

442
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,480
I have 10,000 souls.

443
00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:00,360
I'll kill the...

444
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,159
I could...

445
00:46:01,159 --> 00:46:01,559
Hold on.

446
00:46:02,119 --> 00:46:04,460
Let me take care of this.

447
00:46:05,099 --> 00:46:11,480
It's that one person said no balls and I had to prove them wrong.

448
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:24,880
What did he just throw out of me?

449
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:34,940
No item?

450
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:40,250
This guy's gonna take a lot more.

451
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:47,159
He's got a big mind up.

452
00:46:47,159 --> 00:47:03,230
This is gonna take a while.

453
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:04,030
Leave him alone.

454
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:05,230
Well, he's attacking me.

455
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:06,030
He's trying to kill me.

456
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:19,719
I'm gonna get killed.

457
00:47:23,869 --> 00:47:24,190
Dammit.

458
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:25,389
I thought I could get the third one.

459
00:47:25,949 --> 00:47:36,000
Oh god.

460
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:36,639
Fuck him.

461
00:47:36,639 --> 00:47:37,280
I don't even care.

462
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:37,780
Fuck him.

463
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:39,219
No, he's almost halfway.

464
00:47:39,219 --> 00:47:39,860
He's gonna hit him once.

465
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:52,619
Got it.

466
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:53,340
All right.

467
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:56,050
That guy sucked.

468
00:47:56,050 --> 00:47:56,769
No items.

469
00:47:56,769 --> 00:47:57,010
Why?

470
00:47:57,809 --> 00:47:58,530
I need items.

471
00:48:04,849 --> 00:48:05,409
Now leave.

472
00:48:05,409 --> 00:48:06,289
Not yet.

473
00:48:06,289 --> 00:48:09,949
I want to get to a boss.

474
00:48:09,949 --> 00:48:10,989
The closest boss is the...

475
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:12,750
The Taurus Demon.

476
00:48:13,389 --> 00:48:24,960
Now there's a bonfire down there but I ain't gonna do it.

477
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:25,760
Just pinwheel.

478
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:28,980
Yeah.

479
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:30,980
I'm just gonna level up and I'm gonna go get Taurus Demon.

480
00:48:35,889 --> 00:48:36,530
That's safe.

481
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:37,809
That's a safe play.

482
00:48:37,809 --> 00:48:38,210
You're right.

483
00:48:43,179 --> 00:48:45,019
Guys, it's not even gonna be pinwheel.

484
00:48:45,019 --> 00:48:45,820
Don't you understand?

485
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:47,019
It's gonna be a different person.

486
00:48:53,219 --> 00:48:54,260
Yeah, I am afraid of pinwheel

487
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:57,059
because he's gonna get randomly rolled into like three Gwyns.

488
00:48:57,699 --> 00:49:03,650
Painted cardian robes.

489
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:06,480
Let's go.

490
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:12,719
It's so funny how it just starts hanging.

491
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:43,329
Use the docket.

492
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:49,840
Well, now you have to die.

493
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:58,210
They take up so much space.

494
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:02,699
What should I even be stacking here?

495
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:03,260
Just health?

496
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:08,989
All right.

497
00:50:08,989 --> 00:50:10,110
Let's get some more endurance.

498
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:13,440
Just a shitload of strength.

499
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:16,559
More.

500
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:28,579
Okay.

501
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:30,480
I'm going.

502
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:30,800
Here we go.

503
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,000
More.

504
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,210
I'm gonna get to Taurus Demon.

505
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:42,929
I need...

506
00:50:42,929 --> 00:50:43,329
You know what?

507
00:50:43,329 --> 00:50:45,969
Actually, 20-20 hindsight here.

508
00:50:45,969 --> 00:50:47,409
I should stack in here.

509
00:50:47,409 --> 00:50:51,420
I think I got punched in the back of the head

510
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:53,260
and it severed my spinal cord.

511
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:57,019
It's all right.

512
00:50:57,019 --> 00:50:57,820
I'm fine with dying here.

513
00:50:59,309 --> 00:51:00,110
Use the soul?

514
00:51:01,619 --> 00:51:02,260
Yeah, I can.

515
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:02,659
I could.

516
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:03,380
Just use the...

517
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:03,780
You're right.

518
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:04,019
Yeah.

519
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,280
Use the guardian soul and get 12,000.

520
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,079
Sounds pretty good.

521
00:51:25,630 --> 00:51:27,150
He leveled 23 already.

522
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,500
Didn't mean to do that.

523
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,380
I have another one.

524
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:37,940
It's all right.

525
00:51:38,579 --> 00:51:40,739
Now I shouldn't just take a punch in the back of the head and die.

526
00:51:41,889 --> 00:51:43,889
I need to get to the first fucking boss first

527
00:51:43,889 --> 00:51:44,849
before we do anything else.

528
00:51:49,019 --> 00:51:49,739
Well, I'm dead here.

529
00:51:50,300 --> 00:52:04,219
I just jumped into that.

530
00:52:04,219 --> 00:52:10,880
Oh, god damn it.

531
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:14,559
I'll be happy if I get past the first boss.

532
00:52:15,679 --> 00:52:17,039
I wonder if I can randomize...

533
00:52:17,039 --> 00:52:18,639
Is anybody familiar with this mod?

534
00:52:19,809 --> 00:52:22,449
Know that if I can just turn the game off

535
00:52:22,449 --> 00:52:24,530
and randomize it and play this game again,

536
00:52:25,409 --> 00:52:27,469
do I have to skip?

537
00:52:28,110 --> 00:52:29,630
Oh, and do I have to reload a new game?

538
00:52:30,349 --> 00:52:32,420
Or does it just do it no matter what?

539
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:33,539
Okay, that's cool.

540
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:39,599
I just have to get to the bonfire.

541
00:52:40,239 --> 00:52:42,610
Unless you change the seed, it's fine.

542
00:52:42,610 --> 00:52:43,170
All right, that's cool.

543
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:53,730
Just a humanity in a randomized land.

544
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:55,409
You gotta be kidding me.

545
00:52:55,969 --> 00:52:58,320
Oh, the rat, right?

546
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:04,429
All right, let's try this again.

547
00:53:04,989 --> 00:53:05,869
I'm gonna get topped off

548
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:09,630
and I'm gonna go on the right side.

549
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:13,280
Holy shit.

550
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,159
I didn't even pick anything up.

551
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,880
I got hit so hard, I got an item out of me.

552
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,639
I dropped a loot for that guy.

553
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:34,449
You guys, come on.

554
00:53:35,090 --> 00:53:36,030
Wait, he moved.

555
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:39,809
I don't know what triggered the move, but he moved.

556
00:53:44,139 --> 00:53:45,260
I don't even know why I opened that door.

557
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:48,139
No, no, get out of the way.

558
00:53:51,679 --> 00:53:52,639
Get out of the way.

559
00:53:53,519 --> 00:53:55,119
No, please.

560
00:53:59,150 --> 00:54:01,150
Oh, I can't touch it because they're in here.

561
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:13,550
I gotta get all these people.

562
00:54:25,019 --> 00:54:26,059
No, fuck.

563
00:54:26,059 --> 00:54:31,539
I got tripped up on the pot on the ground.

564
00:54:32,099 --> 00:54:38,900
I'll get up there.

565
00:54:39,619 --> 00:54:43,679
It was the stupid armor dog that blew that whole thing.

566
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:56,030
Thank you.

567
00:54:56,030 --> 00:54:57,230
That was a pretty good jump you just did.

568
00:54:57,230 --> 00:54:57,789
You just saved me.

569
00:54:58,429 --> 00:55:04,639
Move arrow.

570
00:55:05,199 --> 00:55:09,539
Is it time for me to puke?

571
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:10,099
No, not yet.

572
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:11,630
I'm doing all right.

573
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:18,340
The same shit's gonna happen again.

574
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:19,139
He's gonna be in the way.

575
00:55:24,739 --> 00:55:29,380
I'm gonna have to try to shove the hammer.

576
00:55:38,719 --> 00:55:42,300
Why?

577
00:55:44,429 --> 00:55:48,139
I just alley-ooped myself onto his lance.

578
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:57,360
I might have to go down to the crypts.

579
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:12,349
I'll get stuck down there.

580
00:56:12,349 --> 00:56:14,110
Yeah, but at least I might make a little bit of progress.

581
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:30,099
What if I just go down?

582
00:56:30,099 --> 00:56:31,619
No, I have to eventually get up here.

583
00:56:32,179 --> 00:56:37,599
All right, here we go.

584
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:43,760
I need to go right this way.

585
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:48,050
What?

586
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,460
Wow, what does it make any sense?

587
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:55,179
He hit me with the backswing.

588
00:56:55,179 --> 00:56:58,219
I was the catcher behind him and he swung too hard and hit me.

589
00:56:58,219 --> 00:56:58,940
Oh, come on.

590
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:14,130
I'll get it.

591
00:57:16,739 --> 00:57:17,780
Look, this is the hard part.

592
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:22,340
The easy part is when the boss gets re-rolled as this pinwheel five times.

593
00:57:23,139 --> 00:57:25,250
I'll laugh my ass off.

594
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:25,969
I'm not gonna get hit by it.

595
00:57:25,969 --> 00:57:27,010
Not gonna get hit by it.

596
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:27,489
Ready?

597
00:57:27,489 --> 00:57:28,449
One, two, three.

598
00:57:29,409 --> 00:57:30,059
Told you.

599
00:57:31,219 --> 00:57:31,780
All right.

600
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:32,659
I have the right idea.

601
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:37,340
Comes.

602
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:40,130
Get through.

603
00:57:40,769 --> 00:57:43,039
Watch out.

604
00:57:43,039 --> 00:57:44,400
I'm not gonna get hit by this.

605
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:44,880
Told you.

606
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:46,500
To the right.

607
00:57:47,059 --> 00:57:55,630
I get stuck on the thing somehow.

608
00:57:56,429 --> 00:57:58,849
In a second, I'm gonna have to wait for him to come over here.

609
00:57:58,849 --> 00:57:59,329
Yeah, all right.

610
00:57:59,329 --> 00:58:01,329
When he gets down here, I'm going, I gotta wrap around.

611
00:58:02,849 --> 00:58:03,809
One, two, three.

612
00:58:04,530 --> 00:58:15,710
Okay.

613
00:58:15,710 --> 00:58:17,230
This is actually not terrible.

614
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:22,210
I'm invincible.

615
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:23,010
This is perfect.

616
00:58:23,010 --> 00:58:23,510
Perfect.

617
00:58:30,769 --> 00:58:32,050
Not perfect.

618
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:32,769
Very bad.

619
00:58:43,739 --> 00:58:44,460
One v one.

620
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:49,869
All right.

621
00:58:49,869 --> 00:58:51,789
This is the best attempt I'm gonna have here so far.

622
00:58:52,670 --> 00:58:56,860
What does this thing do?

623
00:58:56,860 --> 00:59:00,559
Does it just moan?

624
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:01,280
Or does it do anything?

625
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,239
I don't remember this enemy.

626
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:09,010
He tried.

627
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:09,969
Do you see that?

628
00:59:09,969 --> 00:59:12,449
He tried to just lance me from all the way up.

629
00:59:12,449 --> 00:59:12,690
All right.

630
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:13,889
He has a tongue that comes out.

631
00:59:14,769 --> 00:59:17,309
He's not gonna be able to hit me with it.

632
00:59:17,309 --> 00:59:17,789
I'm too tall.

633
00:59:17,789 --> 00:59:18,670
I'm too short.

634
00:59:18,670 --> 00:59:18,909
Yeah.

635
00:59:18,909 --> 00:59:19,230
Okay.

636
00:59:19,230 --> 00:59:19,710
I'm gonna be...

637
00:59:20,909 --> 00:59:28,420
I'm just gonna stand here.

638
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:29,699
I'm way too small.

639
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:39,739
That guy's so desperate.

640
00:59:39,739 --> 00:59:40,619
I have to get rid of him too.

641
00:59:40,619 --> 00:59:41,019
No, I don't.

642
00:59:41,019 --> 00:59:42,380
I just have to make it up there.

643
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:43,980
I think I should probably kill this thing though.

644
00:59:44,699 --> 01:00:03,300
He's gonna be able to come down.

645
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:03,539
All right.

646
01:00:03,539 --> 01:00:03,860
Drink.

647
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:07,949
Oh, the Estus ship.

648
01:00:08,590 --> 01:00:14,420
I'm not gonna do it.

649
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:14,900
I'm gonna run.

650
01:00:20,190 --> 01:00:25,469
All right.

651
01:00:25,469 --> 01:00:25,789
Out of the way.

652
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:26,110
Out of the way.

653
01:00:26,110 --> 01:00:27,070
Out of the way.

654
01:00:27,070 --> 01:00:27,869
Out of the way please.

655
01:00:27,869 --> 01:00:28,590
Out of the way.

656
01:00:28,590 --> 01:00:29,070
Out of the way.

657
01:00:29,070 --> 01:00:29,469
Out of the way.

658
01:00:29,469 --> 01:00:29,789
Oh my god.

659
01:00:29,789 --> 01:00:30,429
Please get out of the way.

660
01:00:31,389 --> 01:00:31,869
Oh my god.

661
01:00:32,510 --> 01:00:33,300
Where is he?

662
01:00:47,650 --> 01:00:48,210
Just kill it.

663
01:00:48,210 --> 01:00:49,969
I thought he was gonna keep moving backwards.

664
01:00:50,610 --> 01:00:51,650
How hard is it to kill this?

665
01:00:52,530 --> 01:00:53,010
Find out.

666
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:57,900
I don't know.

667
01:00:57,900 --> 01:00:59,260
I'm not gonna fight it.

668
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:02,670
I'm gonna run and hit the boar

669
01:01:02,670 --> 01:01:03,789
and then keep running around in a circle.

670
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:12,539
Do it.

671
01:01:12,539 --> 01:01:12,860
Do it.

672
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:13,099
Do it.

673
01:01:13,099 --> 01:01:14,860
Do it.

674
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:15,420
Sit down.

675
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:15,980
Sit down.

676
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:16,460
Sit down.

677
01:01:33,889 --> 01:01:34,769
I'm good.

678
01:01:34,769 --> 01:01:45,699
So, uh, next step is to keep going

679
01:01:45,699 --> 01:01:46,980
and to go kill the Taurus demon.

680
01:01:47,619 --> 01:01:49,230
I'm gonna wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

681
01:01:49,230 --> 01:01:55,599
Use this.

682
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:59,170
Congratulations.

683
01:01:59,170 --> 01:02:00,449
You made it through the first bonfire.

684
01:02:00,449 --> 01:02:01,170
Yeah, I know, right?

685
01:02:02,289 --> 01:02:04,590
I want more health and endurance.

686
01:02:05,389 --> 01:02:10,269
Is my plan to keep not killing things?

687
01:02:10,269 --> 01:02:11,309
I just killed a bunch of things.

688
01:02:12,190 --> 01:02:17,309
I mean, it's kind of hard with what they're these.

689
01:02:17,949 --> 01:02:31,380
All right.

690
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:32,579
Yeah, you're gonna put another one

691
01:02:32,579 --> 01:02:33,780
of those right in front of there.

692
01:02:34,739 --> 01:02:35,539
But this is hell.

693
01:02:36,099 --> 01:02:37,139
This is actually hell.

694
01:02:37,139 --> 01:02:38,500
I'm not gonna be able to do this.

695
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:39,780
This is fucking over.

696
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:40,820
Are you serious?

697
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:54,369
Hi, guys.

698
01:03:01,090 --> 01:03:06,719
I could jump off, right?

699
01:03:06,719 --> 01:03:08,130
It's these boars.

700
01:03:08,130 --> 01:03:09,409
The boars are just blocking the path

701
01:03:09,409 --> 01:03:10,530
and making it impossible.

702
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:12,300
I think I could get in there.

703
01:03:12,940 --> 01:03:13,820
Let me try to jump down.

704
01:03:17,309 --> 01:03:17,949
Wait, hold on.

705
01:03:18,590 --> 01:03:20,880
Let me see if I can just.

706
01:03:21,519 --> 01:03:23,179
As long as I get in.

707
01:03:23,179 --> 01:03:23,739
All right, I'm in.

708
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:41,119
I don't even know where the dog came from.

709
01:03:45,389 --> 01:03:47,150
It's like Minecraft.

710
01:03:47,150 --> 01:03:48,750
Yeah, it is kind of like Minecraft.

711
01:03:50,050 --> 01:03:50,369
When you.

712
01:04:04,610 --> 01:04:06,860
Oh, my God.

713
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:07,500
Just climb up.

714
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:09,170
They can't get up.

715
01:04:20,429 --> 01:04:20,909
Damn it.

716
01:04:23,630 --> 01:04:24,190
I have to.

717
01:04:24,190 --> 01:04:25,949
I have to kill them one by one.

718
01:04:25,949 --> 01:04:27,070
That's the only way this is gonna happen.

719
01:04:27,070 --> 01:04:27,469
Let's go.

720
01:04:28,429 --> 01:04:29,150
Like that one.

721
01:04:37,179 --> 01:04:37,500
Okay.

722
01:04:38,139 --> 01:04:39,519
What are you doing?

723
01:04:39,519 --> 01:04:40,400
Did you walk up here?

724
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:43,679
I hear something moving.

725
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:44,159
It's that.

726
01:04:44,159 --> 01:04:44,480
I don't.

727
01:04:45,199 --> 01:04:46,320
I have to take care of this thing.

728
01:04:49,659 --> 01:04:50,619
Oh, you dick.

729
01:04:56,019 --> 01:05:04,800
No, I'm gonna jump off.

730
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:11,360
Where's the jump?

731
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,300
Is it at the end of the bridge?

732
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:38,139
All right, I know where it is.

733
01:05:38,139 --> 01:05:38,300
Yeah.

734
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:38,460
Okay.

735
01:05:57,329 --> 01:05:59,889
Go's armor and bellowing dragon crest ring.

736
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:09,869
Are they going all the way around?

737
01:06:10,670 --> 01:06:11,070
All of them.

738
01:06:11,710 --> 01:06:14,530
That's how Dark Souls works, right?

739
01:06:14,530 --> 01:06:26,369
Sorry, it's gonna take them a long time to get here.

740
01:06:26,369 --> 01:06:27,250
Is there any items over here?

741
01:06:38,219 --> 01:06:39,579
Do I hear a cookie bug?

742
01:06:39,579 --> 01:06:40,059
All right.

743
01:06:40,059 --> 01:06:41,260
It's just one of these little idiots.

744
01:06:42,449 --> 01:06:43,409
Oh, you fell down.

745
01:06:43,409 --> 01:06:43,809
Stupid.

746
01:06:44,610 --> 01:06:48,239
Not as tough as your mother.

747
01:06:48,239 --> 01:06:48,639
Are you?

748
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:52,269
Cyanide just gave 20 community subs.

749
01:06:53,949 --> 01:06:57,230
Thank you, Cyanide, for your 20 community subs.

750
01:06:58,030 --> 01:07:02,940
That's a shitload of money.

751
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:03,260
Thank you.

752
01:07:04,769 --> 01:07:07,010
At some point, I gotta make a move here.

753
01:07:07,010 --> 01:07:08,369
And I'm not gonna go for that chest right now.

754
01:07:08,369 --> 01:07:09,010
I'll get it later.

755
01:07:09,809 --> 01:07:11,699
This...

756
01:07:11,699 --> 01:07:12,500
Oh, god, there's nobody.

757
01:07:13,059 --> 01:07:13,860
There was nobody up there.

758
01:07:15,099 --> 01:07:15,659
Oh, no.

759
01:07:15,659 --> 01:07:15,980
Okay.

760
01:07:26,239 --> 01:07:27,679
I'm kind of panicking.

761
01:07:27,679 --> 01:07:29,199
I just gotta get up there to get to the...

762
01:07:29,199 --> 01:07:30,239
Get to the Taurus Demon.

763
01:07:31,650 --> 01:07:32,449
Taurus Demon, go.

764
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:38,739
That is not the Taurus Demon.

765
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:39,940
That...

766
01:07:39,940 --> 01:07:40,820
I think...

767
01:07:40,820 --> 01:07:42,739
I think he's just gonna fall off the edge.

768
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:44,289
Hello?

769
01:07:44,849 --> 01:07:49,599
Wait a minute.

770
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:50,719
This is important.

771
01:07:50,719 --> 01:07:56,610
The gaping dragon cannot fit up here.

772
01:07:56,610 --> 01:07:57,730
These guys don't do anything, right?

773
01:07:57,730 --> 01:07:58,130
They can't.

774
01:07:58,690 --> 01:08:04,159
They're just spectators.

775
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:07,099
All right.

776
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:19,779
Good luck.

777
01:08:19,779 --> 01:08:20,739
Is he gonna aggro?

778
01:08:26,619 --> 01:08:29,409
He takes up the whole bridge.

779
01:08:30,369 --> 01:08:32,689
If he goes down, he's gonna be on the whole bridge.

780
01:08:32,689 --> 01:08:33,569
I can't do this.

781
01:08:34,369 --> 01:08:49,069
Oh, he's on the...

782
01:08:49,069 --> 01:08:50,670
His tin box is so big right here.

783
01:08:51,470 --> 01:08:55,569
Is he aggro?

784
01:09:00,829 --> 01:09:01,390
No!

785
01:09:01,390 --> 01:09:01,630
No!

786
01:09:02,989 --> 01:09:04,430
No, he's gonna run, isn't he?

787
01:09:04,430 --> 01:09:05,310
He runs, right?

788
01:09:06,829 --> 01:09:08,189
I don't fucking remember.

789
01:09:22,159 --> 01:09:25,260
Oh, shit.

790
01:09:25,979 --> 01:09:36,380
Did he...

791
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:37,340
Did he go down?

792
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:37,979
Is he gonna run?

793
01:09:38,859 --> 01:09:40,029
Oh, god.

794
01:09:40,590 --> 01:09:41,229
Oh, no.

795
01:09:41,229 --> 01:09:41,630
I'm dead.

796
01:09:55,090 --> 01:09:55,409
Oh!

797
01:09:56,130 --> 01:10:00,960
Do I have anything...

798
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:01,840
I'm gonna take a humanity.

799
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:03,439
Should I take a humanity?

800
01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:06,930
Oh, god.

801
01:10:06,930 --> 01:10:07,409
He's gonna run.

802
01:10:08,289 --> 01:10:09,329
I am fucked.

803
01:10:09,329 --> 01:10:09,810
I'm fucked.

804
01:10:09,810 --> 01:10:10,210
I'm fucked.

805
01:10:10,210 --> 01:10:10,529
I'm fucked.

806
01:10:10,529 --> 01:10:10,770
I'm fucked.

807
01:10:10,770 --> 01:10:11,090
I'm fucked.

808
01:10:11,090 --> 01:10:11,409
I'm fucked.

809
01:10:11,409 --> 01:10:11,649
I'm fucked.

810
01:10:11,649 --> 01:10:11,970
I'm fucked.

811
01:10:11,970 --> 01:10:12,289
I'm fucked.

812
01:10:12,289 --> 01:10:12,609
I'm fucked.

813
01:10:12,609 --> 01:10:13,010
I'm fucked.

814
01:10:13,010 --> 01:10:13,890
I'm fucked.

815
01:10:13,890 --> 01:10:14,369
I'm fucked.

816
01:10:15,250 --> 01:10:15,810
I'm fucked.

817
01:10:18,579 --> 01:10:19,380
Wait.

818
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:19,939
What?

819
01:10:19,939 --> 01:10:20,739
Climb the ladder!

820
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:24,239
How did you get down here?

821
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:43,810
Yeah!

822
01:10:44,529 --> 01:10:54,859
Oh, fucking god damn it.

823
01:10:59,939 --> 01:11:03,069
Oh, and there goes the humanity.

824
01:11:03,069 --> 01:11:03,390
Shit!

825
01:11:04,109 --> 01:11:06,430
And now I'm all the way back here.

826
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:11,489
That sucks.

827
01:11:12,130 --> 01:11:20,180
I think I missed.

828
01:11:20,180 --> 01:11:20,579
I did.

829
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:25,220
I'll get it this time.

830
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:26,500
I thought he was gonna fall off the edge.

831
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:34,979
I'll get it this time.

832
01:11:34,979 --> 01:11:35,380
Don't worry.

833
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:35,859
I got this.

834
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:44,560
Let me be fair.

835
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:48,399
That's only like the third time I've ever actually done this jump in the five times

836
01:11:48,399 --> 01:11:49,279
I've played through this game.

837
01:11:50,000 --> 01:12:01,680
All right.

838
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:02,319
I'm not doing this right.

839
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:06,239
That's the sixth time I've attempted to do that jump in the five times I've played this game.

840
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:12,079
I didn't even know that existed until somebody told me to do it.

841
01:12:15,279 --> 01:12:15,920
Just roll?

842
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:16,720
I thought I was supposed to jump.

843
01:12:17,439 --> 01:12:22,739
I'm trying just to roll.

844
01:12:22,739 --> 01:12:24,100
I'm trying to do it.

845
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:24,659
I can't do it.

846
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:46,979
How did I do this right the first two times?

847
01:12:47,539 --> 01:12:53,539
I don't understand.

848
01:12:53,539 --> 01:12:55,340
What am I doing different this time?

849
01:12:59,779 --> 01:13:00,899
I don't understand what I'm doing different.

850
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:09,340
Fucking dicks.

851
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:10,539
Oh my god.

852
01:13:29,199 --> 01:13:38,430
I have no idea why I can't do this.

853
01:13:38,430 --> 01:13:38,989
Please stop.

854
01:13:38,989 --> 01:13:40,590
I'm not doing this on purpose.

855
01:13:40,590 --> 01:13:42,270
I'm trying to make the jump.

856
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:51,119
What is happening?

857
01:13:51,119 --> 01:13:52,479
Why can't I do this?

858
01:14:01,229 --> 01:14:03,390
My fucking god.

859
01:14:03,390 --> 01:14:04,590
What am I doing wrong?

860
01:14:05,310 --> 01:14:12,350
I'm about to turn the stream off.

861
01:14:13,489 --> 01:14:13,890
I'm doing it.

862
01:14:13,890 --> 01:14:15,010
I'm turning the stream off.

863
01:14:15,090 --> 01:14:18,539
Gotta put my password in.

864
01:14:18,539 --> 01:14:21,579
There it is.

865
01:14:21,579 --> 01:14:22,300
Okay.

866
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:23,659
Countdown in about four or five hours.

867
01:14:23,659 --> 01:14:24,539
The stream's gonna turn off.

868
01:14:27,010 --> 01:14:27,569
I did it.

869
01:14:27,569 --> 01:14:29,170
The countdown started in like six hours.

870
01:14:29,170 --> 01:14:36,750
The stream's gonna turn off.

871
01:14:36,750 --> 01:14:39,630
I, honest to god, have no fucking idea why I can't do this.

872
01:14:39,630 --> 01:14:41,149
I did it like the first three times I tried it.

873
01:14:41,149 --> 01:14:41,869
What am I doing wrong?

874
01:14:42,510 --> 01:14:45,840
I'm just gonna run.

875
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:56,659
First of all, let me change the worst setting of any video game in history.

876
01:14:56,659 --> 01:14:57,060
Hold on.

877
01:15:13,439 --> 01:15:24,979
No, no.

878
01:15:24,979 --> 01:15:27,859
No, what the fuck are you doing?

879
01:15:27,859 --> 01:15:28,739
Oh, I am.

880
01:15:28,739 --> 01:15:29,779
What is happening?

881
01:15:29,779 --> 01:15:31,779
Just what the hell is going on?

882
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:34,689
It's because I'm using Switch.

883
01:15:37,409 --> 01:15:38,850
Fuck you, game.

884
01:15:38,850 --> 01:15:39,890
Unbelievable.

885
01:15:45,569 --> 01:15:46,210
Back.

886
01:15:46,210 --> 01:15:46,689
Save.

887
01:15:46,689 --> 01:15:47,170
Changes.

888
01:15:47,170 --> 01:15:47,409
Go.

889
01:15:48,210 --> 01:16:01,739
Why is this?

890
01:16:01,739 --> 01:16:02,539
Why can I not dab?

891
01:16:02,539 --> 01:16:03,180
What?

892
01:16:03,180 --> 01:16:04,020
Okay.

893
01:16:04,020 --> 01:16:05,060
It's fixed.

894
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:05,380
It's fixed.

895
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:06,420
It's fixed.

896
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:08,210
I'm gonna try this last time.

897
01:16:08,850 --> 01:16:18,260
I tried just to roll off.

898
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:18,659
I don't know.

899
01:16:18,659 --> 01:16:19,380
I don't know what I'm doing wrong.

900
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:20,020
I don't understand.

901
01:16:20,020 --> 01:16:21,300
I really don't get it.

902
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:24,350
I'm just gonna go the normal way before I fucking freak out.

903
01:16:27,550 --> 01:16:29,149
I tried just to roll off.

904
01:16:29,149 --> 01:16:30,989
No, I'm going the fucking way.

905
01:16:30,989 --> 01:16:32,109
I'm not taking the shortcut.

906
01:16:32,109 --> 01:16:32,510
Let's go.

907
01:16:36,159 --> 01:16:36,640
I made it.

908
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:48,399
These enemies.

909
01:16:52,260 --> 01:16:54,020
Those things are so horrible here.

910
01:17:06,939 --> 01:17:08,060
I swear to God.

911
01:17:08,060 --> 01:17:12,430
I seriously sucks.

912
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:16,960
This jump is easy.

913
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:21,229
I don't know what I'm doing incorrect.

914
01:17:21,229 --> 01:17:24,189
And plus I have like this asshole up my ass the whole time.

915
01:17:24,189 --> 01:17:25,149
I can't line it up.

916
01:17:31,390 --> 01:17:32,029
Just walk?

917
01:17:38,180 --> 01:17:39,060
Just walk off.

918
01:17:51,140 --> 01:17:52,739
Why can't I do this?

919
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:54,340
Oh my God.

920
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:55,300
I'm seriously.

921
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:56,979
I'm fucking getting so pissed off from this.

922
01:17:57,699 --> 01:18:03,979
This is making me madder than the whole eight and a half fucking hours

923
01:18:03,979 --> 01:18:05,020
of Mario Maker last night.

924
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:09,340
I tried to press B.

925
01:18:29,869 --> 01:18:31,229
No, I'm getting caught.

926
01:18:31,229 --> 01:18:32,029
I'm just gonna run.

927
01:18:32,029 --> 01:18:32,510
Oh my God.

928
01:18:32,510 --> 01:18:33,710
I'm gonna fucking lose my mind.

929
01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:34,670
I'm just gonna run.

930
01:18:34,670 --> 01:18:47,300
I'm gonna fucking lose it.

931
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:54,020
I'm not doing it anymore.

932
01:18:54,020 --> 01:19:01,149
Why is that the thing that's got me so caught in fucking A?

933
01:19:01,789 --> 01:19:10,300
This is such a shit roll too.

934
01:19:10,300 --> 01:19:12,699
I have like all these fucking DLC enemies.

935
01:19:37,229 --> 01:19:40,020
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

936
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:40,899
You did it.

937
01:19:40,899 --> 01:19:42,180
Hey, you did it everybody.

938
01:19:42,180 --> 01:19:43,300
Yeah, he's won.

939
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:44,819
I see you finally.

940
01:19:44,819 --> 01:19:58,579
Why are you standing in the worst possible spot?

941
01:20:08,449 --> 01:20:09,649
I couldn't fucking do it.

942
01:20:09,649 --> 01:20:10,609
I promise.

943
01:20:10,609 --> 01:20:11,890
I don't know what the hell is wrong.

944
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:12,689
I couldn't get it.

945
01:20:12,689 --> 01:20:13,810
I tried.

946
01:20:13,810 --> 01:20:15,409
All right, let's get the gaping dragon.

947
01:20:15,409 --> 01:20:19,340
Thank you Pixel Mike for the five community subs.

948
01:20:19,340 --> 01:20:20,779
I have to kill these guys up here

949
01:20:20,779 --> 01:20:24,300
because last time the guy came down and caused a problem.

950
01:20:27,649 --> 01:20:29,329
This guy made his way down somehow.

951
01:20:29,329 --> 01:20:30,449
I don't know how the fuck he did it.

952
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:37,060
All right, if like shitty Ornstein and Smog kill me up here,

953
01:20:37,060 --> 01:20:38,819
I'm gonna be so mad.

954
01:20:39,220 --> 01:20:42,340
I'm gonna be so upset by this and I can already tell.

955
01:20:53,699 --> 01:21:00,960
Why do you have so much health?

956
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:02,399
Is lightning resistant another problem?

957
01:21:09,649 --> 01:21:11,649
All right, this is the attempt here.

958
01:21:11,649 --> 01:21:13,170
I'm gonna try to just be careful.

959
01:21:15,090 --> 01:21:15,970
I almost puked.

960
01:21:15,970 --> 01:21:17,250
It was almost time to turn the stream off.

961
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:18,210
I seriously almost threw up.

962
01:21:25,279 --> 01:21:29,619
All right, so let me put on something.

963
01:21:31,380 --> 01:21:33,220
I'm not gonna put on like this dumb shit.

964
01:21:41,279 --> 01:21:43,460
Am I still?

965
01:21:43,460 --> 01:21:44,100
All right, what about?

966
01:21:44,819 --> 01:21:57,229
I mean, it's a mid roll, but I don't want the mid roll.

967
01:21:57,949 --> 01:22:02,369
Here we go.

968
01:22:02,369 --> 01:22:19,329
Oh no, he really immediately.

969
01:22:20,529 --> 01:22:22,880
Also, why do I keep jumping?

970
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:24,239
I thought I unbound that from B.

971
01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:30,189
That's a hitbox still.

972
01:22:30,829 --> 01:22:33,039
Cut the tail.

973
01:22:38,020 --> 01:22:39,460
He's in such an awkward position.

974
01:22:40,100 --> 01:22:47,619
Oh my God.

975
01:22:48,340 --> 01:22:59,810
Don't do it.

976
01:22:59,810 --> 01:23:00,289
Don't do it.

977
01:23:00,289 --> 01:23:00,689
Don't do it.

978
01:23:00,689 --> 01:23:01,090
Don't do it.

979
01:23:08,750 --> 01:23:09,630
He's too big.

980
01:23:10,510 --> 01:23:20,989
Oh my God.

981
01:23:26,609 --> 01:23:27,489
He's gonna go forward.

982
01:23:28,449 --> 01:23:29,810
Stop running.

983
01:23:29,810 --> 01:23:30,529
Stop running, please.

984
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:32,560
Oh shit.

985
01:23:33,439 --> 01:24:00,369
Anyways, that...

986
01:24:00,369 --> 01:24:11,149
Okay, hold on.

987
01:24:11,149 --> 01:24:14,930
I know, gaping dragon, I'm not gonna make fun of you

988
01:24:14,930 --> 01:24:16,369
because I know how hard it is to make it

989
01:24:16,369 --> 01:24:18,210
from there to the platform down there.

990
01:24:18,210 --> 01:24:19,250
I'm not gonna make fun of you.

991
01:24:19,250 --> 01:24:20,289
And I know you were very close

992
01:24:20,289 --> 01:24:21,409
to just turning off your stream.

993
01:24:22,350 --> 01:24:23,869
And I think you actually did turn it off

994
01:24:23,869 --> 01:24:26,189
because you're not still live anymore.

995
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:32,899
Missed the item, did I?

996
01:24:32,899 --> 01:24:36,079
All right, what do you guys think?

997
01:24:36,079 --> 01:24:37,119
It's time for a roll.

998
01:24:37,119 --> 01:24:37,840
You want to roll it?

999
01:24:52,029 --> 01:24:53,550
Let's try to get to one more boss

1000
01:24:53,550 --> 01:24:54,510
and I'm gonna roll it.

1001
01:24:54,510 --> 01:25:29,949
I'm not gonna kill him.

1002
01:25:29,949 --> 01:25:31,300
Why do you think I'm gonna kill...

1003
01:25:31,300 --> 01:25:32,180
All right, is it gonna be the...

1004
01:25:32,899 --> 01:25:35,250
Will it be the dragon?

1005
01:25:35,250 --> 01:25:41,279
Or is it gonna be somebody else?

1006
01:25:41,279 --> 01:25:43,439
No, why do you have to be here?

1007
01:25:45,100 --> 01:25:46,539
Oh, come on.

1008
01:25:46,539 --> 01:25:50,369
This is like the fourth one of these guys.

1009
01:26:01,039 --> 01:26:02,000
I'm coming here too.

1010
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,800
Me too.

1011
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:05,760
Let's go get him.

1012
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:16,319
Does he breathe the fire?

1013
01:26:16,319 --> 01:26:16,720
Where is he?

1014
01:26:17,279 --> 01:26:18,260
Where is he?

1015
01:26:18,819 --> 01:26:21,010
Where is he?

1016
01:26:21,569 --> 01:26:25,760
Where is he?

1017
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:27,579
Is he just not here?

1018
01:26:27,579 --> 01:26:28,670
Oh, he's up there.

1019
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:29,920
It's...

1020
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:31,039
Is it a gargoyle?

1021
01:26:31,039 --> 01:26:32,159
He's just stuck up there.

1022
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:40,460
No, he's still in here.

1023
01:26:41,020 --> 01:26:54,819
I gotta go back.

1024
01:26:54,819 --> 01:26:55,300
I gotta go back.

1025
01:26:55,300 --> 01:26:55,699
I gotta go back.

1026
01:26:55,699 --> 01:26:56,500
I gotta go to the shortcut.

1027
01:26:57,699 --> 01:26:59,939
I had to just escape through one zone somewhere.

1028
01:26:59,939 --> 01:27:00,420
Is he...

1029
01:27:00,420 --> 01:27:01,220
I see the shadow.

1030
01:27:01,220 --> 01:27:02,020
He's still following me.

1031
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:04,479
Is that a shadow?

1032
01:27:05,699 --> 01:27:07,619
Oh, he's still following me.

1033
01:27:08,260 --> 01:27:10,210
He's gonna fall off the edge though, I think.

1034
01:27:11,229 --> 01:27:12,109
He can't fit up here.

1035
01:27:12,909 --> 01:27:14,909
There's just a bigger rat in here.

1036
01:27:18,930 --> 01:27:19,250
No.

1037
01:27:24,020 --> 01:27:25,699
I have to knock that shortcut down.

1038
01:27:26,340 --> 01:27:41,409
Okay, I'm fine.

1039
01:27:41,409 --> 01:27:42,130
We're good.

1040
01:27:42,130 --> 01:27:49,789
Slide down.

1041
01:27:51,699 --> 01:27:52,100
All right.

1042
01:27:53,439 --> 01:27:54,000
Good.

1043
01:27:54,000 --> 01:28:03,869
Are these random?

1044
01:28:03,869 --> 01:28:04,510
Are these random?

1045
01:28:04,510 --> 01:28:05,310
I didn't choose anything.

1046
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:07,600
You can't choose.

1047
01:28:15,300 --> 01:28:15,779
Hold B?

1048
01:28:15,779 --> 01:28:16,020
That's...

1049
01:28:16,020 --> 01:28:17,220
I thought that that's what I was trying to do.

1050
01:28:19,149 --> 01:28:20,350
All right, let's go back.

1051
01:28:20,350 --> 01:28:22,029
Okay, let's see what happens when we get up there.

1052
01:28:22,750 --> 01:28:23,789
I'm not going that way.

1053
01:28:23,789 --> 01:28:24,430
I'm going up.

1054
01:28:27,010 --> 01:28:28,210
Is he actually gonna breathe fire?

1055
01:28:28,770 --> 01:28:29,649
I don't think he's gonna breathe fire.

1056
01:28:29,649 --> 01:28:30,529
He just stuck in the wall.

1057
01:28:31,090 --> 01:28:35,060
He's just a decoration.

1058
01:28:37,279 --> 01:28:38,159
Cleric armor?

1059
01:28:46,109 --> 01:28:46,430
Can I...

1060
01:28:51,810 --> 01:28:52,609
Let it...

1061
01:28:52,609 --> 01:28:53,569
I let the fire.

1062
01:28:57,569 --> 01:28:58,930
This is fucking crazy.

1063
01:29:04,449 --> 01:29:06,609
You probably had to pick all these enemies.

1064
01:29:06,609 --> 01:29:07,729
No, it's all random.

1065
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:11,520
You can go in and make every enemy the same enemy,

1066
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:13,199
but you can't do random.

1067
01:29:13,199 --> 01:29:14,159
You can't place them anywhere.

1068
01:29:17,439 --> 01:29:18,399
You cannot place them.

1069
01:29:22,619 --> 01:29:23,500
Yeah, we are...

1070
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:25,180
Once I want to see the next area.

1071
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,479
Can you imagine if From Software games were actually like this?

1072
01:29:31,119 --> 01:29:31,920
Well, they are.

1073
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:33,359
Scholar of the First Sins did this.

1074
01:29:34,460 --> 01:29:36,460
That's what that expansion was.

1075
01:29:37,260 --> 01:29:38,529
So they did...

1076
01:29:38,529 --> 01:29:39,810
They already did that.

1077
01:29:39,810 --> 01:29:52,380
And I thought I got through.

1078
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:55,890
Okay.

1079
01:30:05,779 --> 01:30:08,260
This guy's like just trying to pretend he's not here.

1080
01:30:08,260 --> 01:30:10,340
He's trying to camouflage into the wall.

1081
01:30:10,340 --> 01:30:11,300
Hey, I'm not here.

1082
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:13,380
I'm part of the decoration.

1083
01:30:18,140 --> 01:30:19,260
Jeremiah lied about the clown car.

1084
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:20,380
Thanks for five community subs.

1085
01:30:22,050 --> 01:30:22,449
Thank you.

1086
01:30:25,260 --> 01:30:26,140
At least I'm safe here.

1087
01:30:26,859 --> 01:30:38,300
I love it.

1088
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:39,100
It's so dumb.

1089
01:30:39,739 --> 01:30:41,100
You talk about immersion breaking.

1090
01:30:43,229 --> 01:30:43,710
It's that...

1091
01:30:45,619 --> 01:30:45,939
That's like...

1092
01:30:45,939 --> 01:30:46,659
This is comedy.

1093
01:30:46,659 --> 01:30:47,460
That's just a joke.

1094
01:30:47,460 --> 01:30:48,020
All right.

1095
01:30:48,020 --> 01:30:48,500
I need to...

1096
01:30:51,069 --> 01:30:52,989
I'll be safe as long as I get to the button.

1097
01:31:12,699 --> 01:31:13,739
I can't.

1098
01:31:13,739 --> 01:31:15,020
I'm gonna dash through here to the T.

1099
01:31:15,819 --> 01:31:16,859
Oh, I'm dead.

1100
01:31:16,859 --> 01:31:17,819
Well, the door's open.

1101
01:31:18,619 --> 01:31:22,319
So at least I can probably handle that now.

1102
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:31,170
I want to throw...

1103
01:31:31,170 --> 01:31:33,649
I want to shoot the dragon up there.

1104
01:31:36,529 --> 01:31:37,329
3,000.

1105
01:31:37,329 --> 01:31:37,810
Who died?

1106
01:31:38,449 --> 01:31:42,479
Can he spawn at the bonfire?

1107
01:31:42,479 --> 01:31:43,680
I need the Lord Vessel, don't I?

1108
01:31:44,979 --> 01:31:47,460
Which I'm kind of just coming to a realization here.

1109
01:31:48,579 --> 01:31:52,180
I think the Lord Vessel is a random item now.

1110
01:31:52,819 --> 01:32:01,170
Hey!

1111
01:32:01,630 --> 01:32:04,779
What happened to his head?

1112
01:32:04,779 --> 01:32:05,279
Oh.

1113
01:32:23,140 --> 01:32:23,779
I can't go...

1114
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:26,020
Those of you that wanted me to go the rat way.

1115
01:32:26,739 --> 01:32:28,659
I don't think it's gonna happen.

1116
01:32:29,300 --> 01:32:37,869
Maybe it is.

1117
01:32:37,869 --> 01:32:59,840
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1118
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:00,560
Okay.

1119
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:02,000
Ring of the Sun Princess.

1120
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:05,649
I gotta look at some of these rings.

1121
01:33:06,289 --> 01:33:15,420
Boost defense.

1122
01:33:15,420 --> 01:33:16,380
Well, boost sorcery.

1123
01:33:16,380 --> 01:33:17,659
Boost miracle synergy.

1124
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:19,899
Well, none of these are really any good.

1125
01:33:20,859 --> 01:33:22,479
Here we go.

1126
01:33:22,479 --> 01:33:23,199
Undead Parish.

1127
01:33:25,699 --> 01:33:26,199
Slinky.

1128
01:33:30,779 --> 01:33:31,500
Demon...

1129
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:32,699
Two Demon Titanite.

1130
01:33:34,899 --> 01:33:35,539
What?

1131
01:33:35,539 --> 01:33:36,300
Wait a minute.

1132
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:40,159
This is the...

1133
01:33:40,159 --> 01:33:40,960
That's the dragon.

1134
01:33:43,489 --> 01:33:44,130
You all right?

1135
01:33:44,930 --> 01:33:50,770
He's all right.

1136
01:33:50,770 --> 01:33:56,670
He'll be fine.

1137
01:33:56,670 --> 01:33:58,829
I want to see if I can spawn that dragon.

1138
01:33:58,829 --> 01:34:00,109
I want to see if I can kill the dragon.

1139
01:34:00,909 --> 01:34:04,369
I'm gonna throw like a fire bomb at the dragon.

1140
01:34:04,369 --> 01:34:06,130
Let me see if I can get him to be back here.

1141
01:34:06,130 --> 01:34:08,369
Can I just farm Demon Titanite?

1142
01:34:09,090 --> 01:34:10,029
I probably can.

1143
01:34:10,750 --> 01:34:12,829
Yeah, I can just...

1144
01:34:12,829 --> 01:34:14,189
I can farm this bro.

1145
01:34:14,829 --> 01:34:16,689
Now, who's up here?

1146
01:34:17,329 --> 01:34:20,180
There's usually a Black Knight up here.

1147
01:34:20,899 --> 01:34:23,260
What is it now?

1148
01:34:30,239 --> 01:34:37,329
Ring.

1149
01:34:37,329 --> 01:34:37,890
And there it is.

1150
01:34:37,890 --> 01:34:38,850
The best ring in the game.

1151
01:34:38,850 --> 01:34:40,130
I will definitely take that, sure.

1152
01:34:44,420 --> 01:34:44,739
Thank you.

1153
01:34:55,539 --> 01:34:56,420
What rings you got?

1154
01:34:57,140 --> 01:35:01,229
I favor protection.

1155
01:35:01,229 --> 01:35:04,369
The unstoppable.

1156
01:35:04,369 --> 01:35:11,920
All right.

1157
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:12,399
Let's go.

1158
01:35:13,220 --> 01:35:14,819
Deal with this idiot.

1159
01:35:15,539 --> 01:35:16,609
He threw his weapon.

1160
01:35:16,609 --> 01:35:17,329
Doesn't have one anymore.

1161
01:35:19,539 --> 01:35:20,340
That didn't hit.

1162
01:35:20,340 --> 01:35:20,840
Oh.

1163
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:31,279
I got such a shit seed here.

1164
01:35:34,239 --> 01:35:36,640
I think the reroll happens at Capra Demon.

1165
01:35:37,359 --> 01:35:39,149
Because if Capra Demon...

1166
01:35:40,189 --> 01:35:41,460
Hold on.

1167
01:35:41,460 --> 01:35:41,859
No.

1168
01:35:41,859 --> 01:35:42,359
Bye.

1169
01:35:42,819 --> 01:35:48,850
I'm just gonna run through the...

1170
01:35:48,850 --> 01:35:49,810
I'm just running straight through.

1171
01:35:53,659 --> 01:35:54,859
If I even get there, yeah.

1172
01:35:54,859 --> 01:35:55,579
That's another thing.

1173
01:35:55,579 --> 01:35:56,779
If I can even go there.

1174
01:35:59,420 --> 01:35:59,899
Let's see.

1175
01:36:04,510 --> 01:36:05,069
I also...

1176
01:36:05,069 --> 01:36:08,140
I need Estes Chunks.

1177
01:36:11,979 --> 01:36:13,579
Well, thankfully the boar is not here.

1178
01:36:15,579 --> 01:36:17,739
There's just a couple of little enemies.

1179
01:36:18,619 --> 01:36:20,350
Okay, what have we got?

1180
01:36:21,649 --> 01:36:23,010
Gauntlets of the Vanquisher.

1181
01:36:25,619 --> 01:36:26,819
I gotta clear this.

1182
01:36:26,819 --> 01:36:28,260
I can't bring these guys all up here.

1183
01:36:30,529 --> 01:36:31,409
I mean, will it...

1184
01:36:31,409 --> 01:36:34,130
Hold on.

1185
01:36:34,130 --> 01:36:34,529
Thank god.

1186
01:36:34,529 --> 01:36:36,449
I think that's just a regular skeleton that just came on.

1187
01:36:37,170 --> 01:36:39,250
That's the first regular skeleton I think we've seen.

1188
01:36:41,380 --> 01:36:42,739
You're too big to fit in there.

1189
01:36:42,739 --> 01:36:43,220
Yeah.

1190
01:36:43,220 --> 01:36:44,020
So I'm safe here.

1191
01:36:45,060 --> 01:36:45,779
What is this?

1192
01:36:46,420 --> 01:36:48,539
That's another pig.

1193
01:36:51,359 --> 01:36:51,920
How did...

1194
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:53,859
How did you get up here?

1195
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:03,439
What is that?

1196
01:37:15,010 --> 01:37:16,050
I think he's stuck.

1197
01:37:16,609 --> 01:37:20,989
He can't move.

1198
01:37:20,989 --> 01:37:22,189
This, like, elephant thing can't move.

1199
01:37:22,189 --> 01:37:22,750
I can kill it.

1200
01:37:36,640 --> 01:37:43,060
Eldritch Horror.

1201
01:37:43,060 --> 01:37:44,899
His audio isn't even working.

1202
01:37:44,899 --> 01:37:47,970
That's the kind of enemy I feel like will crash the game.

1203
01:37:48,529 --> 01:37:52,140
All right, let's keep going.

1204
01:37:58,399 --> 01:37:59,279
There's more of these.

1205
01:38:01,550 --> 01:38:02,909
Say horror, horror.

1206
01:38:02,909 --> 01:38:03,630
Horror.

1207
01:38:03,630 --> 01:38:04,130
Horror.

1208
01:38:19,069 --> 01:38:20,590
I am in so much trouble.

1209
01:38:21,149 --> 01:38:22,779
I'm in so much trouble.

1210
01:38:28,210 --> 01:38:29,250
Don't come all the way down.

1211
01:38:30,140 --> 01:38:30,619
Back up.

1212
01:38:30,619 --> 01:38:31,420
Please back up.

1213
01:38:32,619 --> 01:38:34,539
You can actually fit down here.

1214
01:38:35,100 --> 01:38:43,970
Look at the top of the church to see the boss.

1215
01:38:44,609 --> 01:38:47,310
Hold on.

1216
01:38:54,659 --> 01:38:56,739
Nice fucking superhero anime move.

1217
01:38:57,300 --> 01:38:58,609
I think I can go by.

1218
01:39:01,020 --> 01:39:04,000
I was raided by Robaz.

1219
01:39:06,689 --> 01:39:08,609
Welcome everybody from Robaz's channel.

1220
01:39:08,609 --> 01:39:10,579
Hope Robaz...

1221
01:39:10,579 --> 01:39:11,699
Hope you had a good stream.

1222
01:39:11,699 --> 01:39:12,579
Welcome.

1223
01:39:12,579 --> 01:39:15,100
We're doing Dark Souls Meltdown stream.

1224
01:39:15,819 --> 01:39:16,140
Where...

1225
01:39:17,180 --> 01:39:19,310
I almost just rolled off the edge.

1226
01:39:19,310 --> 01:39:20,670
But this is randomizer.

1227
01:39:20,670 --> 01:39:21,550
Everything's randomized.

1228
01:39:22,109 --> 01:39:22,909
As per the name.

1229
01:39:23,710 --> 01:39:26,529
That means all enemies, all items.

1230
01:39:26,529 --> 01:39:27,810
Everything has been randomized.

1231
01:39:28,689 --> 01:39:30,210
And there is an Estus thing right here.

1232
01:39:30,770 --> 01:39:32,369
Unless it's random, which...

1233
01:39:34,180 --> 01:39:35,220
Yeah, I...

1234
01:39:35,220 --> 01:39:35,460
That...

1235
01:39:35,460 --> 01:39:36,100
It's all random.

1236
01:39:36,100 --> 01:39:37,300
I'm not gonna be able to get the Lord Vessel.

1237
01:39:37,939 --> 01:39:52,380
I'm gonna have five Estus Flasks the whole game.

1238
01:39:53,180 --> 01:39:59,600
The Lord Vessel isn't random or isn't the Estus Flasks shards not random either?

1239
01:40:00,399 --> 01:40:01,359
I'm gonna be screwed.

1240
01:40:03,140 --> 01:40:05,380
But welcome everybody from Robaz's channel.

1241
01:40:06,720 --> 01:40:07,840
Thanks for joining us.

1242
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:09,760
If you want to stick around, there's plenty to see.

1243
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:12,319
If not, then have a nice rest of your night.

1244
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:15,279
And happy 4th of July soon.

1245
01:40:19,899 --> 01:40:21,739
Oh yeah, this doesn't have shards.

1246
01:40:21,739 --> 01:40:23,899
It has the Firekeeper Souls though.

1247
01:40:23,899 --> 01:40:35,859
The shops are also random?

1248
01:40:35,859 --> 01:40:36,899
That's so stupid.

1249
01:40:37,619 --> 01:40:39,819
All right, let's take inventory here.

1250
01:40:40,619 --> 01:40:45,920
I'll keep the grass shield on.

1251
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:46,420
I don't...

1252
01:40:47,199 --> 01:40:49,500
This is good, but I don't want to use it until I need to.

1253
01:40:50,220 --> 01:40:57,840
I forgot, yeah, you kindle the fire.

1254
01:40:57,840 --> 01:40:58,560
I remember that, yeah.

1255
01:40:59,439 --> 01:41:00,399
All right, let's see what he got.

1256
01:41:23,340 --> 01:41:23,979
Let's see what he got.

1257
01:41:27,859 --> 01:41:28,899
What do we have for miracles?

1258
01:41:39,619 --> 01:41:41,539
Not very holy of you.

1259
01:41:42,420 --> 01:41:46,220
You got Havel's Helm and Crimson Robe.

1260
01:41:46,220 --> 01:41:47,020
How much is that?

1261
01:41:47,020 --> 01:41:47,579
Five thousand?

1262
01:41:51,359 --> 01:41:52,239
Free Souls?

1263
01:41:53,279 --> 01:41:54,239
Wait, hold on.

1264
01:41:56,720 --> 01:41:58,960
Oh, I thought I could buy them as many times as I wanted to.

1265
01:42:01,229 --> 01:42:02,029
All right, bye.

1266
01:42:02,590 --> 01:42:03,649
I'll come back with money.

1267
01:42:04,289 --> 01:42:08,500
Let's go see...

1268
01:42:09,300 --> 01:42:10,579
So here's my question.

1269
01:42:10,579 --> 01:42:11,380
The gargoyles...

1270
01:42:12,989 --> 01:42:16,189
Is both gargoyles considered one entity?

1271
01:42:16,989 --> 01:42:20,989
Or are two gargoyles going to have two different bosses here?

1272
01:42:20,989 --> 01:42:22,029
This is going to be horrible.

1273
01:42:22,829 --> 01:42:29,279
This might be the end where we have to re-roll.

1274
01:42:30,079 --> 01:42:32,159
Because I don't foresee this being...

1275
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:33,520
What's that word again?

1276
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:34,479
Oh yeah, possible.

1277
01:42:35,439 --> 01:42:37,100
But I've done the impossible before.

1278
01:42:39,229 --> 01:42:40,109
I almost...

1279
01:42:40,829 --> 01:42:44,109
I took like 20 to 30 attempts to jump over that bridge thing.

1280
01:42:45,970 --> 01:42:47,489
So, you know, anything's possible.

1281
01:42:48,130 --> 01:42:48,770
All right, let's go.

1282
01:42:49,329 --> 01:42:58,109
Thankfully, it's just a dog.

1283
01:42:58,109 --> 01:42:59,869
Usually it's a guy with a sword and shield.

1284
01:43:00,510 --> 01:43:04,899
Let's play this safe.

1285
01:43:05,460 --> 01:43:07,380
Wait, aren't there like 300 people in this room?

1286
01:43:19,979 --> 01:43:22,300
Am I even going to be able to get up the stairs?

1287
01:43:22,300 --> 01:43:26,939
And it's all huge, huge enemies that are so hard to beat.

1288
01:43:27,899 --> 01:43:30,000
I don't know how to do this.

1289
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:45,020
I'm going to have to just get the throw.

1290
01:43:45,020 --> 01:43:45,819
He got in, he got in.

1291
01:43:45,819 --> 01:43:47,180
They got in, they got in, they got in, they got in.

1292
01:43:47,180 --> 01:43:47,659
Oh shit.

1293
01:43:47,659 --> 01:43:48,779
Oh my god, they're going to flood in here.

1294
01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:50,380
Oh god, no.

1295
01:43:51,260 --> 01:43:51,760
Okay.

1296
01:44:05,630 --> 01:44:08,189
My only option, I think, is to pull them all down here.

1297
01:44:10,500 --> 01:44:14,420
So then it's a bigger space and then I can run by them.

1298
01:44:17,300 --> 01:44:18,020
You are stuck.

1299
01:44:18,579 --> 01:44:30,859
All right, how much health do you have?

1300
01:44:30,859 --> 01:44:31,420
Way too much.

1301
01:44:32,460 --> 01:44:34,609
There's no chance I'll be able to fight this thing.

1302
01:44:35,170 --> 01:44:37,090
I got to get you over here and then I got to run around.

1303
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:39,060
Goodbye.

1304
01:44:40,100 --> 01:44:41,300
See you later.

1305
01:44:41,300 --> 01:44:43,619
I also have to go get the bonfire down by the blacksmith too.

1306
01:44:46,819 --> 01:44:47,779
Oh fuck.

1307
01:44:47,779 --> 01:44:48,819
Oh no, this is not good.

1308
01:44:48,819 --> 01:44:49,319
Very bad.

1309
01:44:50,020 --> 01:44:51,140
Is it not?

1310
01:44:52,319 --> 01:45:03,670
I can't believe I just got fucking hit right when I was about to swing at them.

1311
01:45:07,729 --> 01:45:08,770
I can't believe it.

1312
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:12,720
They're too big.

1313
01:45:16,850 --> 01:45:17,350
What?

1314
01:45:18,850 --> 01:45:20,130
Where are they coming from?

1315
01:45:21,989 --> 01:45:23,829
Why did every single one of these rolled enemies

1316
01:45:23,829 --> 01:45:26,069
have to be five times larger than the space?

1317
01:45:36,520 --> 01:45:38,760
Oh my god, and there's another one of these crabs.

1318
01:46:10,760 --> 01:46:12,600
No, I thought he was stuck.

1319
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:13,890
I thought he was stuck.

1320
01:46:13,890 --> 01:46:14,529
I thought he was stuck.

1321
01:46:18,640 --> 01:46:21,520
What was that teleport dash?

1322
01:46:22,899 --> 01:46:24,340
And Andrew, what's his name?

1323
01:46:24,340 --> 01:46:25,619
Andrew, I need your help, please.

1324
01:46:34,369 --> 01:46:36,800
He cannot get down here.

1325
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:38,159
There's no way it's possible.

1326
01:46:38,159 --> 01:46:39,520
He's not going to make it down here.

1327
01:46:40,159 --> 01:46:42,960
Get the bonfire right here.

1328
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:47,010
Let's go see what he has for us.

1329
01:46:47,010 --> 01:46:59,159
By the way, let's just check what this usually is the thunder god.

1330
01:46:59,800 --> 01:47:02,369
It's just kind of a regular enemy here.

1331
01:47:03,010 --> 01:47:03,649
No, it's not.

1332
01:47:03,649 --> 01:47:04,289
It's one of these guys.

1333
01:47:04,289 --> 01:47:05,090
These guys are awful.

1334
01:47:05,729 --> 01:47:11,890
There we go.

1335
01:47:11,890 --> 01:47:12,840
Scratch that.

1336
01:47:14,600 --> 01:47:15,100
Easy.

1337
01:47:15,479 --> 01:47:21,079
A falchion.

1338
01:47:22,899 --> 01:47:23,399
All right.

1339
01:47:29,300 --> 01:47:30,340
Hello, Andrew.

1340
01:47:34,119 --> 01:47:34,619
Andre.

1341
01:47:39,859 --> 01:47:40,420
Humanity.

1342
01:47:40,420 --> 01:47:41,220
Large soul.

1343
01:47:41,220 --> 01:47:41,859
Large soul.

1344
01:47:42,579 --> 01:47:43,300
Homeward bone.

1345
01:47:45,510 --> 01:47:47,189
Velka's rapier.

1346
01:47:47,750 --> 01:47:49,029
Barb straight sword.

1347
01:47:49,029 --> 01:47:49,829
Spiked shield.

1348
01:47:50,789 --> 01:47:53,779
Leather boots.

1349
01:47:53,779 --> 01:47:54,579
Maiden gloves.

1350
01:47:54,579 --> 01:47:55,079
Hat.

1351
01:48:03,489 --> 01:48:06,180
Well, I can't none of these.

1352
01:48:08,239 --> 01:48:09,840
You can buy infinite souls this time.

1353
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:17,449
Can I?

1354
01:48:22,600 --> 01:48:24,659
Well, I guess God lied to.

1355
01:48:25,380 --> 01:48:27,079
All right.

1356
01:48:27,079 --> 01:48:28,840
Let's try to make it back up there to the gargoyles.

1357
01:48:33,170 --> 01:48:34,850
And I'm gonna I'm gonna tune this one too.

1358
01:48:34,850 --> 01:48:36,850
This is a pretty central bonfire in my opinion.

1359
01:48:39,119 --> 01:48:41,439
Because the uh later on you have sends right there.

1360
01:48:50,340 --> 01:48:51,460
I don't have any humanity.

1361
01:48:52,100 --> 01:48:52,500
All right.

1362
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:54,100
You have to actually use it.

1363
01:49:12,979 --> 01:49:13,859
Invades incoming.

1364
01:49:13,859 --> 01:49:14,500
I'm offline.

1365
01:49:15,140 --> 01:49:20,520
I'm gonna get this to 15.

1366
01:49:29,729 --> 01:49:30,930
Oh, you can't get this one to 15.

1367
01:49:32,840 --> 01:49:33,340
Right.

1368
01:49:33,880 --> 01:49:34,359
It's all right.

1369
01:49:34,359 --> 01:49:34,680
All right.

1370
01:49:34,680 --> 01:49:35,180
Cool.

1371
01:49:36,840 --> 01:49:37,340
Here we go.

1372
01:49:37,880 --> 01:49:39,319
I don't have the right of kindling.

1373
01:49:39,319 --> 01:49:39,819
Right.

1374
01:49:42,939 --> 01:49:47,109
I'm gonna make it up there and it's time to go.

1375
01:49:47,109 --> 01:49:48,630
You can see my bum.

1376
01:49:49,430 --> 01:49:53,750
You really can.

1377
01:49:54,470 --> 01:49:59,159
This is very revealing.

1378
01:49:59,720 --> 01:50:05,930
I'm gonna go quick.

1379
01:50:08,060 --> 01:50:09,500
You take up that much space.

1380
01:50:12,020 --> 01:50:12,899
I'm shocked.

1381
01:50:18,949 --> 01:50:20,390
It's not no way.

1382
01:50:21,109 --> 01:50:22,390
I have to re-roll this.

1383
01:50:24,920 --> 01:50:26,039
Just let it on my neck.

1384
01:50:34,819 --> 01:50:36,100
I have to pull them down.

1385
01:50:37,239 --> 01:50:38,600
They have to fall off.

1386
01:50:38,600 --> 01:50:40,359
And then I gotta climb the ladder.

1387
01:50:40,359 --> 01:50:42,119
I'm not gonna be able to get the ladder in that time.

1388
01:50:42,680 --> 01:50:43,180
No way.

1389
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:48,220
The gargoyles are right up there though.

1390
01:50:48,220 --> 01:50:49,020
I need to get up there.

1391
01:50:49,020 --> 01:50:49,659
I'll get up there.

1392
01:51:00,489 --> 01:51:01,689
Everybody's so huge.

1393
01:51:05,609 --> 01:51:07,609
Just make a giant blockade.

1394
01:51:08,329 --> 01:51:15,279
Okay.

1395
01:51:15,819 --> 01:51:23,779
I'm not even hurting this dude.

1396
01:51:31,819 --> 01:51:32,539
Diagro.

1397
01:51:32,539 --> 01:51:40,359
Come on.

1398
01:51:40,359 --> 01:51:41,000
Diagro.

1399
01:52:00,180 --> 01:52:01,779
I just brought the other guy over.

1400
01:52:10,010 --> 01:52:11,210
Just reset them.

1401
01:52:11,210 --> 01:52:14,090
Reset them.

1402
01:52:14,090 --> 01:52:27,159
Just kill me.

1403
01:52:27,159 --> 01:52:27,960
Damn it.

1404
01:52:27,960 --> 01:52:33,130
Can I re-roll while the game is open?

1405
01:52:34,500 --> 01:52:34,739
No.

1406
01:52:34,739 --> 01:52:36,340
That would probably be a very bad idea, right?

1407
01:52:37,060 --> 01:52:47,300
I'll try this one more time.

1408
01:52:47,300 --> 01:52:53,880
Because he's in the spot right now where he's very easily just block the door.

1409
01:52:54,520 --> 01:52:56,460
Hey, he's gonna block it every time.

1410
01:52:56,460 --> 01:52:59,399
There we go.

1411
01:52:59,399 --> 01:52:59,880
I made it.

1412
01:53:03,319 --> 01:53:03,960
All right, come on.

1413
01:53:03,960 --> 01:53:04,600
I'm...

1414
01:53:04,600 --> 01:53:05,479
Forget about the dog.

1415
01:53:05,479 --> 01:53:06,279
I'm going right up.

1416
01:53:14,729 --> 01:53:15,229
No!

1417
01:53:15,850 --> 01:53:21,000
All right.

1418
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:22,119
I have to do this tactically.

1419
01:53:22,680 --> 01:53:28,840
How do I tactically take care of this?

1420
01:53:29,399 --> 01:53:32,250
All right.

1421
01:53:32,250 --> 01:53:33,369
Now they have to all fall down.

1422
01:53:33,369 --> 01:53:33,850
So here we go.

1423
01:53:33,850 --> 01:53:34,350
Ready?

1424
01:53:35,579 --> 01:53:37,020
Now they're all looking at me.

1425
01:53:37,020 --> 01:53:38,600
Now get them to all fall down.

1426
01:53:50,979 --> 01:53:52,180
Come on, all of you.

1427
01:53:52,180 --> 01:53:54,420
The whole entire trip of you come down.

1428
01:53:54,420 --> 01:53:55,460
Come on, please.

1429
01:53:55,460 --> 01:53:55,939
All right, go.

1430
01:53:59,369 --> 01:54:00,170
I don't think there's anything...

1431
01:54:00,890 --> 01:54:01,850
You motherfucker.

1432
01:54:01,850 --> 01:54:02,970
You're the only one.

1433
01:54:02,970 --> 01:54:04,409
You're the only one.

1434
01:54:04,409 --> 01:54:21,500
You gotta be kidding me.

1435
01:54:25,529 --> 01:54:26,489
That was the one, too.

1436
01:54:26,489 --> 01:54:28,970
I have to pull them all down that little hallway.

1437
01:54:28,970 --> 01:54:29,470
They'll...

1438
01:54:30,949 --> 01:54:31,270
Sorry.

1439
01:54:31,270 --> 01:54:32,149
I'm good.

1440
01:54:32,149 --> 01:54:32,630
I'll get it.

1441
01:54:33,270 --> 01:54:39,340
I'm just gonna walk straight through his legs.

1442
01:54:40,060 --> 01:54:49,640
He'll do that every time.

1443
01:54:50,359 --> 01:54:52,060
All right.

1444
01:54:52,060 --> 01:54:52,539
Here we go.

1445
01:55:02,539 --> 01:55:02,939
Agro.

1446
01:55:02,939 --> 01:55:03,340
Everybody.

1447
01:55:03,899 --> 01:55:05,100
Here they all come.

1448
01:55:05,100 --> 01:55:05,979
Hey, look at me.

1449
01:55:05,979 --> 01:55:06,699
Yes, yes, yes.

1450
01:55:06,699 --> 01:55:07,739
You're all very, very cool.

1451
01:55:07,739 --> 01:55:08,220
Here we go.

1452
01:55:09,930 --> 01:55:10,489
There's you.

1453
01:55:14,810 --> 01:55:17,529
I have to wait till that weird blob,

1454
01:55:17,529 --> 01:55:19,770
amorphous, weird thing falls down, too.

1455
01:55:19,770 --> 01:55:24,329
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1456
01:55:24,329 --> 01:55:24,810
There it is.

1457
01:55:24,810 --> 01:55:25,289
They're all down.

1458
01:55:28,229 --> 01:55:29,590
Nothing is gonna block the way now.

1459
01:55:30,229 --> 01:55:32,739
There's gonna be a slug right here.

1460
01:55:34,170 --> 01:55:34,569
No.

1461
01:55:34,569 --> 01:55:34,890
Good.

1462
01:55:34,890 --> 01:55:35,130
Go.

1463
01:55:45,159 --> 01:55:45,960
Oh, Jesus.

1464
01:55:46,680 --> 01:55:47,350
All right.

1465
01:55:47,350 --> 01:55:55,960
I made it.

1466
01:55:55,960 --> 01:55:56,520
Here we go.

1467
01:56:12,329 --> 01:56:13,130
Did the gargoyle...

1468
01:56:14,090 --> 01:56:15,770
Is that a gargoyle up in the top left?

1469
01:56:15,850 --> 01:56:16,890
Is this a skeleton?

1470
01:56:26,090 --> 01:56:26,409
What?

1471
01:56:26,970 --> 01:56:27,210
No.

1472
01:56:27,210 --> 01:56:27,850
What is that?

1473
01:56:32,300 --> 01:56:33,979
I don't know what I'm looking at here.

1474
01:56:46,359 --> 01:56:51,619
He's being pulled through a fucking black hole.

1475
01:56:56,819 --> 01:56:57,140
Wait.

1476
01:56:57,140 --> 01:56:58,659
What do you mean bell gargoyle?

1477
01:56:58,659 --> 01:56:59,220
Is there gonna be a...

1478
01:57:00,100 --> 01:57:22,279
Shit.

1479
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:49,689
Ow.

1480
01:57:49,689 --> 01:57:57,479
Oh, fuck.

1481
01:57:57,479 --> 01:57:58,039
Oh, my God.

1482
01:57:58,039 --> 01:57:58,199
No.

1483
01:58:03,659 --> 01:58:04,539
Oh, I didn't dodge it.

1484
01:58:05,100 --> 01:58:05,500
I'm bad.

1485
01:58:05,500 --> 01:58:06,939
I'm in trouble.

1486
01:58:06,939 --> 01:58:26,500
He's fucked up.

1487
01:58:26,500 --> 01:58:27,380
His AI is fucked up.

1488
01:58:27,380 --> 01:58:29,930
No, it's not.

1489
01:58:29,930 --> 01:58:30,890
Off the edge.

1490
01:58:30,890 --> 01:58:31,529
Back up.

1491
01:58:31,529 --> 01:58:32,090
Off the edge.

1492
01:58:32,090 --> 01:58:32,329
Quick.

1493
01:58:32,890 --> 01:58:34,489
Wait, he can fly.

1494
01:59:12,329 --> 01:59:12,810
I don't think...

1495
01:59:13,449 --> 01:59:14,869
I don't think that's possible.

1496
01:59:16,789 --> 01:59:17,829
Use the dark hand?

1497
01:59:19,220 --> 01:59:19,859
Reroll.

1498
01:59:19,859 --> 01:59:20,340
Reroll.

1499
01:59:20,340 --> 01:59:20,500
All right.

1500
01:59:20,500 --> 01:59:21,140
Let's reroll.

1501
01:59:21,140 --> 01:59:21,699
Let's reroll.

1502
01:59:21,699 --> 01:59:22,340
We're gonna reroll it.

1503
01:59:22,340 --> 01:59:22,739
Here we go.

1504
01:59:23,380 --> 01:59:31,210
Wait, hold on.

1505
01:59:31,210 --> 01:59:33,930
Should I put the crystal sword on?

1506
01:59:35,510 --> 01:59:37,029
It's gonna spawn another boss.

1507
01:59:39,399 --> 01:59:40,119
Go down to...

1508
01:59:40,119 --> 01:59:40,279
All right.

1509
01:59:40,279 --> 01:59:40,920
I could go down.

1510
01:59:41,819 --> 01:59:41,979
Yeah.

1511
01:59:41,979 --> 01:59:42,699
Let's do...

1512
01:59:42,699 --> 01:59:43,420
I'll do dark root.

1513
01:59:43,420 --> 01:59:44,220
I'll try dark root.

1514
01:59:50,069 --> 01:59:51,989
I'm allowed to reroll once an hour.

1515
02:00:00,680 --> 02:00:01,079
Yeah.

1516
02:00:01,079 --> 02:00:02,039
Can I upgrade the hammer?

1517
02:00:02,039 --> 02:00:03,079
What does it take?

1518
02:00:03,079 --> 02:00:06,789
I can.

1519
02:00:06,789 --> 02:00:07,670
What is it?

1520
02:00:07,670 --> 02:00:09,430
Twinkling titanite, unfortunately.

1521
02:00:16,840 --> 02:00:17,319
I'll try...

1522
02:00:18,439 --> 02:00:19,479
Here's the thing about the butterfly.

1523
02:00:20,840 --> 02:00:22,840
This could be a very, very good thing.

1524
02:00:22,840 --> 02:00:24,920
Because the butterfly might just spawn in the air

1525
02:00:24,920 --> 02:00:26,439
when I go through the bonfire

1526
02:00:26,439 --> 02:00:27,399
and just fall and die.

1527
02:00:28,779 --> 02:00:30,140
If it's not the butterfly.

1528
02:00:31,399 --> 02:00:33,800
So it might actually be a pretty good idea.

1529
02:00:34,600 --> 02:00:43,220
Thanks for the easy enemy.

1530
02:00:43,939 --> 02:00:46,649
I really appreciate that.

1531
02:00:46,649 --> 02:00:53,699
What the hell was that?

1532
02:00:57,579 --> 02:00:58,460
It's dead, whatever it was.

1533
02:00:59,100 --> 02:01:18,010
Yeah, this is our remastered.

1534
02:01:18,010 --> 02:01:19,689
That is the best T-pose I've ever seen.

1535
02:01:21,460 --> 02:01:22,180
Ow.

1536
02:01:22,180 --> 02:01:26,550
It's marvelous.

1537
02:01:26,550 --> 02:01:42,439
What am I stuck on?

1538
02:01:57,619 --> 02:01:57,859
How?

1539
02:02:02,699 --> 02:02:03,260
No!

1540
02:02:03,260 --> 02:02:04,060
Don't die here.

1541
02:02:05,560 --> 02:02:06,359
I don't know what it is.

1542
02:02:06,359 --> 02:02:08,600
I've always had trouble with these snakes.

1543
02:02:08,600 --> 02:02:09,399
For some weird reason.

1544
02:02:09,399 --> 02:02:10,039
I don't know what it is.

1545
02:02:11,529 --> 02:02:12,329
Like, I don't know what it is,

1546
02:02:12,329 --> 02:02:13,050
but I don't know what it is,

1547
02:02:13,050 --> 02:02:13,850
but I don't know what it is.

1548
02:02:14,649 --> 02:02:29,260
All right, let's go butterfly.

1549
02:02:29,260 --> 02:02:30,300
I just have to get through here.

1550
02:02:31,100 --> 02:02:32,300
Don't forget about the secret.

1551
02:02:32,300 --> 02:02:34,220
Don't forget about the bonfire that's right here.

1552
02:02:34,939 --> 02:02:38,899
You never played Dark Souls before.

1553
02:02:38,899 --> 02:02:39,460
It's right there.

1554
02:02:40,180 --> 02:02:50,890
Am I gonna be able to...

1555
02:02:50,890 --> 02:02:52,729
I can't get that open ever.

1556
02:02:53,369 --> 02:03:08,100
Moonlight Robe and Red Sign Soapstone.

1557
02:03:08,100 --> 02:03:09,699
Well, at least I can invade somebody now.

1558
02:03:10,260 --> 02:03:22,500
Let's go.

1559
02:03:23,140 --> 02:03:26,140
Now, if I remember that there's

1560
02:03:27,100 --> 02:03:28,619
like six or seven enemies over here,

1561
02:03:29,260 --> 02:03:33,510
and they're all crabs and shit.

1562
02:03:33,510 --> 02:03:34,710
Why does it have to be crabs?

1563
02:03:35,590 --> 02:03:44,420
Thankfully, they're not getting up.

1564
02:03:45,060 --> 02:03:56,310
Homeward Bone.

1565
02:03:56,310 --> 02:03:57,829
Key to the Seal.

1566
02:03:57,829 --> 02:04:05,180
Do I get to skip Light Town?

1567
02:04:05,180 --> 02:04:06,140
Wait a minute.

1568
02:04:06,140 --> 02:04:15,689
Key to the floodgates of New Londo,

1569
02:04:15,689 --> 02:04:17,449
which seal away the Four Kings.

1570
02:04:17,449 --> 02:04:18,890
Oh, it's the Four Kings.

1571
02:04:22,569 --> 02:04:23,529
That's so stupid.

1572
02:04:40,260 --> 02:04:41,060
Will they aggro?

1573
02:04:41,619 --> 02:04:44,220
I don't want to fight these guys.

1574
02:04:44,220 --> 02:04:45,020
I'm just gonna go around the edge.

1575
02:04:50,899 --> 02:04:51,779
I'm putting up with this.

1576
02:04:59,529 --> 02:05:00,489
Giant Rat?

1577
02:05:00,489 --> 02:05:06,920
Just a regular rat, actually.

1578
02:05:07,560 --> 02:05:16,090
Is there something back here?

1579
02:05:16,729 --> 02:05:23,579
You need to get every single item.

1580
02:05:23,579 --> 02:05:25,340
One of them is going to be the Lord Vessel.

1581
02:05:25,340 --> 02:05:25,899
I know.

1582
02:05:25,899 --> 02:05:26,779
That's what I'm saying.

1583
02:05:26,779 --> 02:05:29,100
I think I have it set that key items

1584
02:05:29,819 --> 02:05:30,460
are not...

1585
02:05:33,180 --> 02:05:36,300
T-Pussing Dragon is so stupid.

1586
02:05:36,300 --> 02:05:38,060
He's just doing a plane impression.

1587
02:05:51,220 --> 02:05:52,260
Oh my god!

1588
02:05:53,300 --> 02:05:55,300
Why did they all come to life instantly?

1589
02:05:55,939 --> 02:06:08,619
Well, at least I got the item.

1590
02:06:17,430 --> 02:06:19,270
Oh, a golden legend.

1591
02:06:20,149 --> 02:06:27,050
Get out of here.

1592
02:06:29,779 --> 02:06:30,579
No, no, no.

1593
02:06:32,409 --> 02:06:32,890
Hold on.

1594
02:06:36,659 --> 02:06:37,699
Isn't this shit down here?

1595
02:06:38,420 --> 02:06:58,060
There's like three to four items.

1596
02:06:58,060 --> 02:07:01,130
Yeah.

1597
02:07:01,130 --> 02:07:02,649
I hope one of them is the Lord Vessel.

1598
02:07:02,649 --> 02:07:03,770
I would laugh my ass off.

1599
02:07:04,569 --> 02:07:12,409
Oh, no.

1600
02:07:13,369 --> 02:07:14,250
Don't do it, Jeremy.

1601
02:07:14,250 --> 02:07:16,010
No, that's not what's gonna get you killed.

1602
02:07:16,010 --> 02:07:16,729
It's not that.

1603
02:07:16,729 --> 02:07:17,529
It's the enemies.

1604
02:07:20,279 --> 02:07:21,560
Oh, I'm in trouble now.

1605
02:07:21,560 --> 02:07:22,680
Oh, I've really done it now.

1606
02:07:43,029 --> 02:07:44,949
Crystal Shield, Shortbow.

1607
02:07:44,949 --> 02:07:47,399
Fuck, these guys are horrible.

1608
02:07:47,399 --> 02:07:49,239
I remember they're in the depths, right?

1609
02:07:49,239 --> 02:07:51,479
The catacombs with that pitch black place.

1610
02:07:52,279 --> 02:07:56,020
Nothing else.

1611
02:07:56,020 --> 02:07:56,819
Get up back up.

1612
02:07:56,819 --> 02:07:57,460
I don't even care.

1613
02:07:58,500 --> 02:08:18,390
Tomb of the Giant, not the catacombs, though.

1614
02:08:19,029 --> 02:08:21,770
I knew it was one of them.

1615
02:08:21,770 --> 02:08:23,449
Whatever the one is that is all dark.

1616
02:08:30,060 --> 02:08:30,859
Missed item.

1617
02:08:30,859 --> 02:08:32,699
It's too dangerous down there right now.

1618
02:08:46,260 --> 02:08:47,619
It could be the Lord Vessel.

1619
02:08:47,619 --> 02:08:51,430
This is gonna be the Lord Vessel.

1620
02:08:51,430 --> 02:08:52,550
What the fuck?

1621
02:08:52,550 --> 02:09:02,329
All right, got that item.

1622
02:09:02,890 --> 02:09:06,340
All right, now I just gotta go this way

1623
02:09:06,340 --> 02:09:07,619
and then we gotta fight the butterfly.

1624
02:09:07,619 --> 02:09:08,579
Let's see what it's gonna be.

1625
02:09:10,229 --> 02:09:11,989
I'm thinking the butterfly is gonna be...

1626
02:09:13,189 --> 02:09:19,100
What do you get?

1627
02:09:19,100 --> 02:09:19,659
Place your bets.

1628
02:09:20,300 --> 02:09:32,489
Who do you think?

1629
02:09:33,130 --> 02:09:35,770
It's gonna be Gwyn.

1630
02:09:35,770 --> 02:09:37,930
Whoever it is, they're gonna fall right to their death.

1631
02:09:37,930 --> 02:09:39,159
Here we go.

1632
02:09:47,850 --> 02:09:49,369
It's Ornstein.

1633
02:09:50,090 --> 02:09:50,970
Ornstein.

1634
02:09:50,970 --> 02:09:52,569
And he is so huge.

1635
02:09:53,659 --> 02:09:54,220
I don't...

1636
02:09:54,220 --> 02:09:55,020
He needs to fall off.

1637
02:10:08,970 --> 02:10:09,689
He's not dead?

1638
02:10:10,329 --> 02:10:11,939
What do you mean he's not dead?

1639
02:10:12,579 --> 02:10:15,699
How is he still alive?

1640
02:10:17,619 --> 02:10:20,340
He fell off the edge, but he was so big

1641
02:10:20,340 --> 02:10:21,699
that the fall damage didn't kill him.

1642
02:10:37,369 --> 02:10:38,329
Just menu him.

1643
02:10:38,329 --> 02:10:38,729
Hold on.

1644
02:10:38,729 --> 02:10:39,130
Not yet.

1645
02:10:39,770 --> 02:10:41,220
I may be able to get him to walk off.

1646
02:10:41,859 --> 02:11:01,659
I don't even see him.

1647
02:11:02,460 --> 02:11:05,529
No, I'm just gonna reload

1648
02:11:05,529 --> 02:11:06,890
and he'll probably die, right?

1649
02:11:10,729 --> 02:11:30,020
All right, here we go.

1650
02:11:30,020 --> 02:11:31,619
No, it just resets the area.

1651
02:11:39,539 --> 02:11:40,020
Where am I?

1652
02:11:44,140 --> 02:11:44,380
I...

1653
02:11:45,020 --> 02:11:56,170
He died to moonlit butterfly.

1654
02:11:58,970 --> 02:12:03,109
I gotta get him to fall off

1655
02:12:03,109 --> 02:12:05,189
to where there's no ground

1656
02:12:05,189 --> 02:12:06,789
and it's that side that he's on.

1657
02:12:06,789 --> 02:12:07,750
I'll get there, hold on.

1658
02:12:30,630 --> 02:12:32,409
All right, let's try this again.

1659
02:12:33,289 --> 02:12:34,890
I have to get him to fall off up here.

1660
02:12:35,529 --> 02:12:44,579
Over this way, come here.

1661
02:12:45,220 --> 02:12:46,359
You're gonna fall off here.

1662
02:12:47,159 --> 02:12:49,819
Can I just kill him?

1663
02:12:49,819 --> 02:12:51,100
He doesn't have that much health, does he?

1664
02:12:53,930 --> 02:12:54,170
Fall.

1665
02:12:56,090 --> 02:12:57,130
Fall that way.

1666
02:12:57,130 --> 02:13:03,109
He's got a dickload of health.

1667
02:13:03,109 --> 02:13:04,229
What am I talking about?

1668
02:13:04,229 --> 02:13:04,710
There he goes.

1669
02:13:04,710 --> 02:13:05,270
All right, dead.

1670
02:13:13,300 --> 02:13:14,819
No, it has to be over here.

1671
02:13:15,539 --> 02:13:46,699
This room is not programmed to kill bosses who fall.

1672
02:13:46,699 --> 02:13:47,420
Yeah, that's right

1673
02:13:47,420 --> 02:13:49,500
because there is no way to fall.

1674
02:13:49,500 --> 02:13:55,380
Falling is not possible.

1675
02:13:55,380 --> 02:14:12,520
Optional, so it doesn't matter.

1676
02:14:12,520 --> 02:14:13,640
I'm gonna try to fight him.

1677
02:14:15,220 --> 02:14:16,579
Here's the problem about fighting him.

1678
02:14:18,359 --> 02:14:19,800
I might actually get him down to halfway

1679
02:14:19,800 --> 02:14:21,159
and he'll fall off.

1680
02:14:21,159 --> 02:14:32,899
It's gonna take forever.

1681
02:14:41,609 --> 02:14:41,930
Shit!

1682
02:14:52,460 --> 02:14:53,020
Just wait.

1683
02:14:54,310 --> 02:14:55,750
I don't think it's gonna happen.

1684
02:14:55,750 --> 02:14:57,109
Wait, wait, wait.

1685
02:14:57,829 --> 02:14:58,569
Just wait.

1686
02:15:00,789 --> 02:15:01,350
Just wait.

1687
02:15:01,909 --> 02:15:20,649
You sounded like a crosswalk.

1688
02:15:21,579 --> 02:15:21,819
Wait.

1689
02:15:22,819 --> 02:15:23,140
Wait.

1690
02:15:25,750 --> 02:15:26,069
Wait.

1691
02:15:27,079 --> 02:15:27,399
Wait.

1692
02:15:29,020 --> 02:15:29,659
I'm getting baited.

1693
02:15:37,670 --> 02:15:38,390
Reroll.

1694
02:15:38,390 --> 02:15:39,189
Time to reroll.

1695
02:15:42,380 --> 02:15:43,340
It's reroll time.

1696
02:15:44,779 --> 02:15:45,979
I think we're locked.

1697
02:15:45,979 --> 02:15:50,340
Here we go.

1698
02:15:50,340 --> 02:15:57,640
It's time to reroll.

1699
02:15:57,640 --> 02:15:58,920
Wait.

1700
02:15:58,920 --> 02:15:59,239
Wait.

1701
02:16:01,640 --> 02:16:03,670
All right, I'm gonna do it.

1702
02:16:03,670 --> 02:16:04,949
This time I'm gonna make it.

1703
02:16:04,949 --> 02:16:06,630
We're gonna up the ante a little bit here.

1704
02:16:06,630 --> 02:16:15,800
So this time, let's see.

1705
02:16:15,800 --> 02:16:16,760
Let's do...

1706
02:16:16,760 --> 02:16:21,239
I can have it be replace bosses with only bosses

1707
02:16:21,239 --> 02:16:25,000
with normal enemies or with bosses or normal enemies.

1708
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:31,130
Replace normal enemies with bosses or normal enemies.

1709
02:16:34,489 --> 02:16:35,209
Or, okay.

1710
02:16:36,180 --> 02:16:38,420
How about replace normal enemies with bosses?

1711
02:16:40,389 --> 02:16:42,069
Might have to reroll this one instantly.

1712
02:16:44,219 --> 02:16:46,700
Replace all normal enemies with bosses.

1713
02:16:48,340 --> 02:16:53,719
That's clown show though.

1714
02:16:53,719 --> 02:16:54,680
No, we're not there yet.

1715
02:16:54,680 --> 02:16:55,479
We aren't there yet.

1716
02:16:58,069 --> 02:17:00,549
Replace NPCs with bosses.

1717
02:17:01,479 --> 02:17:02,440
I think that's kind of fun.

1718
02:17:08,409 --> 02:17:11,260
All right.

1719
02:17:11,260 --> 02:17:12,780
Enemy placement anywhere.

1720
02:17:12,780 --> 02:17:15,020
Percentage for a boss to spawn.

1721
02:17:15,020 --> 02:17:16,780
Chance that a boss will be replaced with a boss

1722
02:17:16,780 --> 02:17:18,299
instead of a normal enemy.

1723
02:17:18,299 --> 02:17:19,180
I'm gonna put this at...

1724
02:17:19,180 --> 02:17:20,059
Let's put this at 50%.

1725
02:17:24,899 --> 02:17:25,940
100%.

1726
02:17:25,940 --> 02:17:27,059
No, that's too wild.

1727
02:17:28,309 --> 02:17:29,350
Let's do like 30%.

1728
02:17:30,229 --> 02:17:31,739
That's better.

1729
02:17:34,139 --> 02:17:34,620
All right, here we go.

1730
02:17:34,620 --> 02:17:35,420
I'm rolling it.

1731
02:17:35,420 --> 02:17:35,899
You ready?

1732
02:17:36,860 --> 02:17:38,059
Three, two, one.

1733
02:17:38,059 --> 02:17:38,540
Here it comes.

1734
02:17:57,129 --> 02:17:57,690
This is gonna...

1735
02:17:57,690 --> 02:17:57,930
Hold on.

1736
02:17:57,930 --> 02:17:59,129
Wait, I gotta do it again.

1737
02:17:59,129 --> 02:18:03,079
This is gonna be fucking nuts.

1738
02:18:04,229 --> 02:18:06,549
33% chance for a normal enemy to be boss.

1739
02:18:16,819 --> 02:18:19,299
We may or may not have to redo this again.

1740
02:18:19,299 --> 02:18:19,940
Because this...

1741
02:18:19,940 --> 02:18:21,379
And I'm not rerolling the items.

1742
02:18:21,379 --> 02:18:22,659
The items are still the same.

1743
02:18:22,659 --> 02:18:23,700
That's way too high.

1744
02:18:25,219 --> 02:18:25,780
We'll see.

1745
02:18:25,780 --> 02:18:26,420
It might not be.

1746
02:18:26,420 --> 02:18:26,899
Well, maybe we'll...

1747
02:18:27,940 --> 02:18:29,219
Maybe we'll get a good roll here.

1748
02:18:29,940 --> 02:18:34,549
All right, let's get back in.

1749
02:18:35,190 --> 02:18:38,090
Let's see who we rolled Orenstein into.

1750
02:18:38,809 --> 02:18:40,969
Now it's possible that Orenstein could be rolled into a skeleton.

1751
02:18:40,969 --> 02:18:41,770
And I'll kill him in one hit.

1752
02:18:45,420 --> 02:18:47,100
Every three monsters is a boss.

1753
02:18:48,120 --> 02:18:48,520
Kind of.

1754
02:18:54,600 --> 02:18:55,559
That's too high.

1755
02:18:55,559 --> 02:18:58,360
Well, it's all right.

1756
02:18:58,920 --> 02:19:06,620
Here we go.

1757
02:19:06,620 --> 02:19:17,379
I think it's a normal enemy.

1758
02:19:20,180 --> 02:19:23,159
Moonlit Butterfly is...

1759
02:19:24,520 --> 02:19:25,639
I think it's just like a chef.

1760
02:19:44,409 --> 02:19:45,690
That's the easiest boss in the game.

1761
02:19:45,690 --> 02:19:46,329
Pyromance.

1762
02:19:46,329 --> 02:19:47,290
The Acid Surge.

1763
02:19:48,170 --> 02:19:49,209
Purple Moss Clump.

1764
02:19:49,770 --> 02:19:50,489
And what?

1765
02:19:50,489 --> 02:19:51,610
I don't even know what I just picked up.

1766
02:19:51,610 --> 02:19:52,729
There was like five items here.

1767
02:19:52,729 --> 02:19:53,370
What did I just get?

1768
02:20:03,270 --> 02:20:04,069
Acid Surge.

1769
02:20:06,329 --> 02:20:06,969
Humanity.

1770
02:20:06,969 --> 02:20:09,860
Okay.

1771
02:20:09,860 --> 02:20:10,100
Nice.

1772
02:20:14,969 --> 02:20:18,139
All right.

1773
02:20:18,139 --> 02:20:19,100
Did you reroll items?

1774
02:20:19,100 --> 02:20:19,659
No, I did not.

1775
02:20:20,219 --> 02:20:23,739
I will not reroll items until it's very, very necessary.

1776
02:20:23,739 --> 02:20:25,340
And maybe when I reroll the items,

1777
02:20:25,340 --> 02:20:27,500
maybe we'll do it a few times and get something weird.

1778
02:20:33,540 --> 02:20:38,840
I don't know.

1779
02:20:38,840 --> 02:20:40,920
Hello Carving is what was up here.

1780
02:20:41,719 --> 02:20:42,760
And Helm of Thorns.

1781
02:20:44,040 --> 02:20:44,920
And Wolf Ring.

1782
02:20:45,559 --> 02:20:54,600
Hello.

1783
02:20:54,600 --> 02:20:56,149
What's that helmet?

1784
02:20:56,149 --> 02:20:57,110
Helm of Thorns.

1785
02:20:57,750 --> 02:20:58,469
Yeah, let's get it on.

1786
02:20:59,270 --> 02:20:59,510
All right.

1787
02:20:59,510 --> 02:21:09,799
Let's head back down and let's have the fun begin again.

1788
02:21:10,360 --> 02:21:12,200
Now I'm going to go try to do the gargoyles again

1789
02:21:12,200 --> 02:21:14,120
because it's going to be something different.

1790
02:21:15,020 --> 02:21:15,420
Use it.

1791
02:21:15,420 --> 02:21:15,739
Use it.

1792
02:21:15,739 --> 02:21:16,700
No, I don't think so.

1793
02:21:16,700 --> 02:21:17,180
I don't want to.

1794
02:21:18,469 --> 02:21:19,270
No, no, no.

1795
02:21:19,270 --> 02:21:19,829
I don't think so.

1796
02:21:27,799 --> 02:21:28,200
Do it.

1797
02:21:28,200 --> 02:21:28,600
All right.

1798
02:21:28,600 --> 02:21:28,840
Fine.

1799
02:21:30,860 --> 02:21:32,700
Hello.

1800
02:21:32,700 --> 02:21:36,420
God.

1801
02:21:36,420 --> 02:21:39,989
That wasn't it?

1802
02:21:42,840 --> 02:21:45,399
That was an exact audio replication of that item.

1803
02:21:54,260 --> 02:21:56,180
Why is the rat so big now?

1804
02:21:56,739 --> 02:22:02,569
I didn't do anything to increase the rat's size.

1805
02:22:02,569 --> 02:22:03,450
Why is he huge?

1806
02:22:04,170 --> 02:22:18,790
This is kind of freaking me out.

1807
02:22:20,969 --> 02:22:21,770
He's enormous.

1808
02:22:22,489 --> 02:22:32,260
Okay.

1809
02:22:35,719 --> 02:22:36,680
Let's go back.

1810
02:22:36,680 --> 02:22:38,040
I want to do the gargoyles again.

1811
02:22:38,760 --> 02:22:41,190
I need to level up too.

1812
02:22:41,750 --> 02:22:46,940
I hope the gargoyle is a rat.

1813
02:22:46,940 --> 02:22:48,780
I hope the gargoyle is two hollows.

1814
02:22:49,819 --> 02:22:50,780
Are two hollows.

1815
02:22:54,069 --> 02:22:55,270
No, I'm not doing that.

1816
02:23:05,190 --> 02:23:05,430
All right.

1817
02:23:05,430 --> 02:23:06,229
Let's do strength.

1818
02:23:10,969 --> 02:23:11,850
Where are all the bosses?

1819
02:23:11,850 --> 02:23:13,370
See, I told you it was a decent number.

1820
02:23:14,569 --> 02:23:18,329
That means there's a 70% chance and it rolls every time.

1821
02:23:18,329 --> 02:23:21,129
70%, 70%, 70% that it's not going to be a boss.

1822
02:23:21,930 --> 02:23:36,459
This thing is freaky.

1823
02:23:44,459 --> 02:23:45,180
Got it.

1824
02:23:45,180 --> 02:23:51,420
Another one of those blobs.

1825
02:23:52,139 --> 02:23:53,020
Just avoid it.

1826
02:24:04,600 --> 02:24:06,899
I don't want anything to do with you.

1827
02:24:09,370 --> 02:24:09,690
Ow.

1828
02:24:10,409 --> 02:24:12,200
My back is so itchy.

1829
02:24:12,840 --> 02:24:19,829
Could you put Bart Simpson in with this mod?

1830
02:24:19,829 --> 02:24:20,709
I don't think so.

1831
02:24:20,709 --> 02:24:21,829
It has to.

1832
02:24:21,829 --> 02:24:22,069
No.

1833
02:24:22,629 --> 02:24:29,020
A secure randomizer.

1834
02:24:29,420 --> 02:24:33,260
I think that game may be not completable, but you can.

1835
02:24:36,139 --> 02:24:36,940
Let's upgrade the hammer.

1836
02:24:39,540 --> 02:24:40,979
Wait, I need twinkling titanite.

1837
02:24:40,979 --> 02:24:41,940
Never mind.

1838
02:24:41,940 --> 02:24:46,569
There's a mod for custom skins.

1839
02:24:46,569 --> 02:24:48,170
I feel like that would be so hard to implement.

1840
02:24:55,209 --> 02:24:56,889
Andre, you look a little...

1841
02:24:56,889 --> 02:24:57,850
Hi, Andre.

1842
02:24:57,850 --> 02:24:58,250
Speaking...

1843
02:24:58,250 --> 02:24:58,969
No, never mind.

1844
02:24:59,850 --> 02:25:01,209
No, no, no, no, no.

1845
02:25:01,209 --> 02:25:01,930
Don't say it.

1846
02:25:01,930 --> 02:25:02,969
I know what everyone's going to say.

1847
02:25:14,389 --> 02:25:15,430
That's pretty good, though.

1848
02:25:23,030 --> 02:25:23,909
These didn't change.

1849
02:25:28,979 --> 02:25:30,979
There's a reference I can make here, but I'm not going to.

1850
02:25:31,780 --> 02:25:34,600
Uh-oh.

1851
02:25:35,159 --> 02:25:55,659
I have to re-roll.

1852
02:25:59,879 --> 02:26:02,440
I got to go through the Valley of the Drakes.

1853
02:26:02,440 --> 02:26:02,840
Yep.

1854
02:26:02,840 --> 02:26:04,520
I got to go around the whole thing.

1855
02:26:04,520 --> 02:26:12,120
Just kick him?

1856
02:26:15,209 --> 02:26:28,790
Does he stay like this forever?

1857
02:26:31,770 --> 02:26:32,409
He doesn't, right?

1858
02:26:33,049 --> 02:26:44,250
I just fucked up the whole game.

1859
02:26:53,700 --> 02:26:54,420
Wait, no, no, no.

1860
02:26:54,420 --> 02:26:55,299
I can remove sins.

1861
02:26:55,299 --> 02:26:56,180
I can remove sins.

1862
02:26:57,219 --> 02:26:57,780
That's right.

1863
02:26:57,780 --> 02:26:58,100
Okay.

1864
02:26:58,100 --> 02:26:58,979
Everything's going to be fine.

1865
02:26:58,979 --> 02:27:00,260
I just can't level up any items.

1866
02:27:03,500 --> 02:27:06,059
You have to beat the gargoyles to get them de-aggroed.

1867
02:27:06,059 --> 02:27:06,459
That's it.

1868
02:27:06,459 --> 02:27:07,020
I can do that.

1869
02:27:19,350 --> 02:27:19,909
What?

1870
02:27:19,909 --> 02:27:23,620
I don't understand.

1871
02:27:23,700 --> 02:27:28,489
Um, it's that...

1872
02:27:38,340 --> 02:27:41,700
How do they get them both as the demon?

1873
02:27:43,379 --> 02:27:44,659
10,000 souls for free.

1874
02:27:44,659 --> 02:27:45,700
Oh, look, a skeleton.

1875
02:27:46,420 --> 02:27:47,510
So scary.

1876
02:27:50,299 --> 02:27:50,780
I'm going to...

1877
02:27:50,780 --> 02:27:51,819
I got to go to this bonfire.

1878
02:27:54,739 --> 02:27:54,979
What?

1879
02:27:55,620 --> 02:27:57,020
Get it?

1880
02:27:57,020 --> 02:27:57,500
No, no, no.

1881
02:27:57,500 --> 02:27:57,899
I need...

1882
02:27:57,899 --> 02:27:58,620
I want this bonfire.

1883
02:27:59,260 --> 02:28:19,829
That was the centipede demon.

1884
02:28:19,829 --> 02:28:29,579
You're not changed.

1885
02:28:29,579 --> 02:28:30,459
That's kind of freaking me out.

1886
02:28:30,459 --> 02:28:42,489
Why are you still the same?

1887
02:28:42,489 --> 02:28:43,930
Did he roll into himself?

1888
02:28:52,440 --> 02:28:53,159
All right.

1889
02:28:53,159 --> 02:28:56,659
Now we're going to go back and it's this Capra demon.

1890
02:28:56,659 --> 02:28:57,219
That's fine.

1891
02:29:02,059 --> 02:29:03,739
Yeah, I'll get the secret items on the elevator.

1892
02:29:03,739 --> 02:29:04,379
Not a bad idea.

1893
02:29:04,940 --> 02:29:19,020
How high up is it?

1894
02:29:19,020 --> 02:29:20,940
Is this the first cliff or the second cliff?

1895
02:29:20,940 --> 02:29:22,139
I think it's the second cliff, right?

1896
02:29:24,600 --> 02:29:25,799
There's two ways to go, right?

1897
02:29:26,760 --> 02:29:28,809
Or this is just the first cliff.

1898
02:29:37,340 --> 02:29:38,700
Yeah, it's that first one.

1899
02:29:41,239 --> 02:29:42,920
When you walk up the tree, you go to the bird.

1900
02:29:43,799 --> 02:29:45,399
There is only one, right?

1901
02:29:45,399 --> 02:29:48,200
I'm like combining every game I've played from From Software.

1902
02:29:49,000 --> 02:30:01,379
Okay, so I got those.

1903
02:30:01,379 --> 02:30:01,780
Isn't there...

1904
02:30:01,780 --> 02:30:02,739
Yeah, there's those up there.

1905
02:30:03,780 --> 02:30:04,739
How do I get up there?

1906
02:30:04,739 --> 02:30:05,540
Can I even get up there?

1907
02:30:06,420 --> 02:30:08,059
Wait, I already got those.

1908
02:30:08,700 --> 02:30:11,620
How do I get across there?

1909
02:30:12,340 --> 02:30:19,239
Oh yeah, you jump, right?

1910
02:30:19,239 --> 02:30:20,280
Now you jump to one of these.

1911
02:30:21,159 --> 02:30:30,790
Now you jump from here.

1912
02:30:35,639 --> 02:30:35,959
Whoops.

1913
02:30:35,959 --> 02:30:36,600
I was trying to...

1914
02:30:36,600 --> 02:30:37,879
I got fucking locked.

1915
02:30:39,290 --> 02:30:41,129
Yeah, you jump from the grass part.

1916
02:30:41,129 --> 02:30:41,770
It's been a while.

1917
02:30:45,450 --> 02:30:46,409
I got stuck down there.

1918
02:30:57,799 --> 02:30:59,000
Now you get AI?

1919
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:01,639
All of a sudden, the first time in two and a half hours,

1920
02:31:02,280 --> 02:31:07,940
the armored pigs have artificial intelligence now.

1921
02:31:07,940 --> 02:31:11,670
It took you 10 of those for you to do anything.

1922
02:31:12,229 --> 02:31:13,780
Well, let's do this again.

1923
02:31:14,420 --> 02:31:24,809
This is my first Dark Souls experience.

1924
02:31:24,809 --> 02:31:26,090
This game looks fun, but hard.

1925
02:31:27,590 --> 02:31:28,469
Yeah, it is.

1926
02:31:28,469 --> 02:31:31,579
It is pretty hard, especially considering

1927
02:31:33,100 --> 02:31:35,979
when they do this, all the random bosses that spawn.

1928
02:31:36,780 --> 02:31:39,059
It's like weird that they put that in the game.

1929
02:31:41,579 --> 02:31:43,340
Oh yeah, so jump from here to there, right?

1930
02:31:43,340 --> 02:31:44,219
Yeah, right here.

1931
02:31:46,729 --> 02:31:48,250
I'm so awful at this kind of shit.

1932
02:31:48,969 --> 02:31:50,200
I got it.

1933
02:31:50,200 --> 02:31:55,340
All right, there's items.

1934
02:31:55,899 --> 02:31:56,700
Is there one over here?

1935
02:31:57,260 --> 02:31:59,639
Up there.

1936
02:32:01,180 --> 02:32:02,620
Actually, I have to fall from there, don't I?

1937
02:32:03,340 --> 02:32:17,110
Anything in the nest?

1938
02:32:23,219 --> 02:32:23,620
Mimics?

1939
02:32:23,620 --> 02:32:24,979
I'm not even sure Mimics spawn.

1940
02:32:25,700 --> 02:32:26,420
I don't think it can.

1941
02:32:27,139 --> 02:32:28,100
Isn't it impossible?

1942
02:32:38,040 --> 02:32:38,840
Master key.

1943
02:32:39,719 --> 02:32:44,840
What does the...

1944
02:32:44,840 --> 02:32:46,360
Open any basic lock.

1945
02:32:46,360 --> 02:32:47,559
Oh, right.

1946
02:32:48,940 --> 02:32:49,180
Cool.

1947
02:32:50,059 --> 02:32:53,420
Is there anything else up here?

1948
02:32:53,979 --> 02:33:03,500
Whoa, don't fall off.

1949
02:33:03,500 --> 02:33:09,770
It's slipping me off into the nest.

1950
02:33:10,329 --> 02:33:17,420
Is there an item in the nest?

1951
02:33:17,420 --> 02:33:18,219
Wasn't I just up there?

1952
02:33:18,780 --> 02:33:24,139
I'm going to fucking fall off here.

1953
02:33:28,920 --> 02:33:31,209
Yep, bye.

1954
02:33:31,209 --> 02:33:32,090
Whatever.

1955
02:33:32,090 --> 02:33:38,459
All right, I'm going forward.

1956
02:33:39,020 --> 02:33:45,709
Hello?

1957
02:33:55,819 --> 02:33:57,420
That fucking hurt my face.

1958
02:33:57,420 --> 02:33:58,620
My chest hurts.

1959
02:33:59,500 --> 02:34:00,860
I just did not expect that at all.

1960
02:34:15,420 --> 02:34:16,700
Okay, he's dead.

1961
02:34:16,700 --> 02:34:21,850
I'm sorry about that loud noise.

1962
02:34:21,850 --> 02:34:22,969
That was fucking terrifying.

1963
02:34:29,139 --> 02:34:32,979
All right, I'm going back to the tower to go to the gargoyles.

1964
02:34:33,620 --> 02:34:36,329
He was silent.

1965
02:34:36,329 --> 02:34:36,969
It was completely...

1966
02:34:36,969 --> 02:34:38,090
There was no sound at all.

1967
02:34:38,090 --> 02:34:39,209
It was silent.

1968
02:34:40,889 --> 02:34:42,409
That was so quiet.

1969
02:34:43,049 --> 02:34:46,579
Use the nest, go back to the undead asylum.

1970
02:34:46,579 --> 02:34:47,459
Yeah, we can do that.

1971
02:34:48,020 --> 02:34:49,059
I want to do this first, though.

1972
02:34:49,780 --> 02:34:56,280
Because then...

1973
02:34:56,280 --> 02:34:57,319
Well, it was sift before.

1974
02:34:57,399 --> 02:34:58,600
Now who knows what hell it is now.

1975
02:35:01,879 --> 02:35:02,440
It's my birthday.

1976
02:35:02,440 --> 02:35:03,639
Can you say what's up, sinners?

1977
02:35:04,280 --> 02:35:05,780
What's going on, sinners?

1978
02:35:05,780 --> 02:35:06,420
Happy birthday.

1979
02:35:08,329 --> 02:35:09,530
I don't know why I just even did that.

1980
02:35:22,040 --> 02:35:23,639
This is going to be horrible getting up here.

1981
02:35:23,639 --> 02:35:24,680
Oh no, a slug.

1982
02:35:25,559 --> 02:35:26,600
Thank God it's not a boss.

1983
02:35:27,639 --> 02:35:37,209
Okay.

1984
02:35:50,379 --> 02:35:52,459
We got to do the same thing again.

1985
02:35:52,459 --> 02:35:53,979
We got to pull everybody down.

1986
02:35:53,979 --> 02:35:55,819
Oh, hey, guess what?

1987
02:35:55,819 --> 02:36:05,670
The demon just jumped off a cliff somewhere.

1988
02:36:05,670 --> 02:36:06,629
Come on, everybody.

1989
02:36:07,270 --> 02:36:11,430
Holy shit, that reach went through the whole cathedral.

1990
02:36:12,709 --> 02:36:16,870
Oh, come on.

1991
02:36:17,430 --> 02:36:23,819
Let's try this again.

1992
02:36:32,040 --> 02:36:32,680
Unbelievable.

1993
02:36:34,440 --> 02:36:37,079
Well, now I know he can reach me from wherever he's standing.

1994
02:36:38,280 --> 02:36:39,079
Click on the link.

1995
02:36:41,129 --> 02:36:43,750
Link, link, link.

1996
02:36:43,750 --> 02:36:51,450
What is this just going up?

1997
02:36:51,450 --> 02:36:54,090
I will get to these gargoyles.

1998
02:36:54,090 --> 02:36:54,809
It's going to happen.

1999
02:37:02,139 --> 02:37:03,739
Reroll, but make everything a skeleton.

2000
02:37:04,379 --> 02:37:07,219
I mean, once I get sick of doing this,

2001
02:37:07,940 --> 02:37:10,180
we're going to throw all the dice in the air.

2002
02:37:10,180 --> 02:37:12,100
I'm talking every enemy pinwheel.

2003
02:37:12,100 --> 02:37:13,700
I'm talking only giant rats.

2004
02:37:13,700 --> 02:37:15,299
Like, only rats run through.

2005
02:37:15,299 --> 02:37:16,739
See if I can beat the game against all rats.

2006
02:37:21,430 --> 02:37:22,950
All right, I got to make...

2007
02:37:22,950 --> 02:37:23,829
I need to pull.

2008
02:37:23,829 --> 02:37:24,469
There we go.

2009
02:37:24,469 --> 02:37:25,030
Come on down.

2010
02:37:25,590 --> 02:37:26,950
I think I got the guy that was the...

2011
02:37:26,950 --> 02:37:27,909
Okay, Ornstein's down.

2012
02:37:27,909 --> 02:37:28,870
They're both down.

2013
02:37:30,420 --> 02:37:31,139
Oh, fuck.

2014
02:37:31,940 --> 02:37:32,739
Oh, man.

2015
02:37:32,739 --> 02:37:33,379
Not good.

2016
02:37:33,379 --> 02:37:34,260
You got to be kidding me.

2017
02:37:34,260 --> 02:37:34,739
This is bad.

2018
02:37:36,170 --> 02:37:37,049
No, I'm fucked.

2019
02:37:49,930 --> 02:37:51,290
I have to kill stuff.

2020
02:37:51,290 --> 02:37:52,329
I can't just run through this.

2021
02:37:53,530 --> 02:37:55,370
When people come down, they have to die.

2022
02:37:56,090 --> 02:37:58,260
I got to go up the stairs first,

2023
02:37:59,989 --> 02:38:02,069
kill the two things that are there,

2024
02:38:02,069 --> 02:38:03,430
and then aggro everybody down.

2025
02:38:09,659 --> 02:38:11,260
Every single enemy is Artorias.

2026
02:38:11,819 --> 02:38:13,700
Can do that.

2027
02:38:27,219 --> 02:38:28,100
Oh, that's a sign.

2028
02:38:28,100 --> 02:38:29,700
It's time for rat-only mode.

2029
02:38:33,340 --> 02:38:33,819
Not yet.

2030
02:38:37,450 --> 02:38:37,850
Okay.

2031
02:38:38,649 --> 02:38:39,530
Quickly go up here.

2032
02:38:40,409 --> 02:38:41,610
Take out these two enemies.

2033
02:38:46,459 --> 02:38:48,860
And when I say quickly, I mean do it quickly.

2034
02:38:50,219 --> 02:38:50,700
This guy...

2035
02:38:51,500 --> 02:38:58,920
Stupid long arms.

2036
02:38:58,920 --> 02:38:59,319
All right.

2037
02:38:59,319 --> 02:39:01,399
Now I have a straight shot.

2038
02:39:02,280 --> 02:39:04,149
Pull everybody down.

2039
02:39:04,149 --> 02:39:05,829
Watch out for this demon.

2040
02:39:06,549 --> 02:39:07,350
Everybody come down.

2041
02:39:13,100 --> 02:39:13,579
Come on.

2042
02:39:13,579 --> 02:39:14,299
I need Ornstein.

2043
02:39:15,100 --> 02:39:15,819
And there we go.

2044
02:39:16,379 --> 02:39:16,790
All right.

2045
02:39:16,790 --> 02:39:17,670
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

2046
02:39:17,670 --> 02:39:17,909
You too.

2047
02:39:17,909 --> 02:39:18,389
I need you too.

2048
02:39:18,389 --> 02:39:19,030
You too, you too.

2049
02:39:19,670 --> 02:39:23,510
The big guy had to go down too.

2050
02:39:23,510 --> 02:39:24,149
I don't think he did.

2051
02:39:24,149 --> 02:39:25,030
No, I'm in trouble.

2052
02:39:35,579 --> 02:39:36,219
Oh, no.

2053
02:39:39,180 --> 02:39:40,860
This guy is attached to me.

2054
02:39:44,360 --> 02:39:45,959
They all have to come down.

2055
02:39:45,959 --> 02:39:46,520
All of them.

2056
02:39:47,239 --> 02:39:52,500
Otherwise, I can't even physically walk through the door.

2057
02:39:57,319 --> 02:39:59,079
It's just that stupid demon outside

2058
02:39:59,079 --> 02:40:02,520
that can just sweep and hit me from anywhere in the cathedral.

2059
02:40:03,239 --> 02:40:17,260
Do I have skulls?

2060
02:40:17,260 --> 02:40:18,940
I do not have any skulls, I don't think.

2061
02:40:20,100 --> 02:40:21,700
All items are randomized as well.

2062
02:40:21,700 --> 02:40:23,379
So I don't think I even have one.

2063
02:40:37,850 --> 02:40:38,809
Check new Londo?

2064
02:40:38,809 --> 02:40:39,530
Yeah, that's true.

2065
02:40:40,569 --> 02:40:42,170
I'm going to give this one more attempt

2066
02:40:42,170 --> 02:40:43,690
and then I'm going to go the other way.

2067
02:40:43,690 --> 02:40:44,889
I'm going to go somewhere else.

2068
02:40:44,889 --> 02:40:46,729
Although, is there even another way I can go right now?

2069
02:40:47,690 --> 02:40:51,989
I'm going to pull the ones that I know I can kill

2070
02:40:52,790 --> 02:40:54,389
because I keep getting screwed by the rat.

2071
02:40:55,110 --> 02:40:56,389
The two long-armed people.

2072
02:41:03,059 --> 02:41:06,790
Yeah, see, this is what's causing a problem.

2073
02:41:07,350 --> 02:41:09,110
I would love to see.

2074
02:41:11,219 --> 02:41:14,299
All right, that clears out all the shitties.

2075
02:41:14,860 --> 02:41:17,670
I think I'm going to pull the other shitties through the wall here

2076
02:41:17,670 --> 02:41:22,409
because I think there's a couple that can still make it through.

2077
02:41:23,049 --> 02:41:25,770
There's a rat there.

2078
02:41:26,569 --> 02:41:43,430
Oh, God.

2079
02:41:46,360 --> 02:41:47,399
Oh, my God.

2080
02:41:48,200 --> 02:41:50,020
That just killed me instantly.

2081
02:41:50,659 --> 02:41:55,049
I thought I had the right idea.

2082
02:42:00,790 --> 02:42:01,110
Fuck.

2083
02:42:02,520 --> 02:42:04,280
Oh, it's so aggravating.

2084
02:42:04,280 --> 02:42:04,680
Damn it.

2085
02:42:05,479 --> 02:42:09,139
Why did they have to kill me in one hit?

2086
02:42:09,139 --> 02:42:10,659
Like, does it really have to kill you instantly?

2087
02:42:10,659 --> 02:42:12,420
Like, you just die?

2088
02:42:13,219 --> 02:42:22,940
That's the most amount of damage I possibly could have taken.

2089
02:42:22,940 --> 02:42:23,659
Yeah, I know.

2090
02:42:23,659 --> 02:42:24,219
It sucks.

2091
02:42:24,940 --> 02:42:31,239
I'm getting up there.

2092
02:42:53,510 --> 02:42:55,030
Stuff everybody into a door.

2093
02:42:55,030 --> 02:42:57,110
I just delete the dragon.

2094
02:42:57,110 --> 02:42:58,950
It's the dragon that's causing the problem.

2095
02:42:59,909 --> 02:43:07,879
There's the rat.

2096
02:43:07,879 --> 02:43:10,409
There's the rat.

2097
02:43:10,809 --> 02:43:15,350
The dragon is making this so hellish.

2098
02:43:16,540 --> 02:43:18,540
If only he just wasn't in the way.

2099
02:43:19,100 --> 02:43:29,209
All right.

2100
02:43:29,209 --> 02:43:30,729
Well, I'm going to go for it.

2101
02:43:30,729 --> 02:43:36,780
It's important that they all come down.

2102
02:43:40,819 --> 02:43:41,940
One, two.

2103
02:43:42,819 --> 02:43:43,620
Where's Ornstein?

2104
02:43:43,620 --> 02:43:44,180
Come on.

2105
02:43:44,180 --> 02:43:44,420
Three.

2106
02:43:44,420 --> 02:43:45,219
I need the big guy, too.

2107
02:43:45,860 --> 02:43:46,260
Big guy.

2108
02:43:46,260 --> 02:43:46,500
Come on.

2109
02:43:46,500 --> 02:43:46,819
Come on.

2110
02:43:46,819 --> 02:43:47,059
Come on.

2111
02:43:47,059 --> 02:43:47,299
Go.

2112
02:43:47,940 --> 02:43:49,319
This is the one.

2113
02:43:49,319 --> 02:43:49,639
This is it.

2114
02:43:49,639 --> 02:43:49,959
This is it.

2115
02:43:49,959 --> 02:43:50,440
This is the one.

2116
02:43:50,440 --> 02:43:51,079
I'm going to get up there.

2117
02:43:51,639 --> 02:43:53,620
Just watch out here.

2118
02:43:53,620 --> 02:43:55,139
This is probably going to be like a rat or two.

2119
02:44:02,940 --> 02:44:04,700
35,000 soul.

2120
02:44:05,340 --> 02:44:08,250
Oh, I don't know what's following me.

2121
02:44:08,250 --> 02:44:09,930
They're scaring the shit out of me.

2122
02:44:09,930 --> 02:44:10,409
All right, I'm fine.

2123
02:44:11,370 --> 02:44:12,329
Taurus demon time.

2124
02:44:12,329 --> 02:44:13,129
Not Taurus demon time.

2125
02:44:13,129 --> 02:44:13,610
Gargoyles.

2126
02:44:17,579 --> 02:44:18,299
All right, here we go.

2127
02:44:22,229 --> 02:44:23,670
Please be a default enemy.

2128
02:44:26,299 --> 02:44:27,340
I can handle this.

2129
02:44:27,340 --> 02:44:27,979
I can handle this.

2130
02:44:32,299 --> 02:44:33,819
There's the guy in the back.

2131
02:44:37,739 --> 02:44:39,420
There's a guy standing in the back.

2132
02:44:40,379 --> 02:44:41,739
I could have done it, too.

2133
02:44:41,739 --> 02:44:42,700
Wow.

2134
02:44:42,700 --> 02:44:43,100
God.

2135
02:44:43,979 --> 02:44:45,100
It was the Taurus.

2136
02:44:46,920 --> 02:44:50,040
I was paying attention to the magician in the background.

2137
02:44:51,219 --> 02:44:51,940
I can do this.

2138
02:44:52,579 --> 02:44:54,020
It's going to be two Taurus demons.

2139
02:44:54,020 --> 02:44:54,420
Whatever.

2140
02:44:55,379 --> 02:44:57,639
Oh, I'm going to pee my pants, too.

2141
02:44:57,639 --> 02:44:58,280
Shit.

2142
02:44:58,280 --> 02:44:58,680
Whatever.

2143
02:45:06,790 --> 02:45:07,989
I have to get through this.

2144
02:45:10,899 --> 02:45:13,299
It's such a pain in the ass to get them all to follow.

2145
02:45:14,260 --> 02:45:16,709
Now, I need a weapon I can actually upgrade, too.

2146
02:45:18,100 --> 02:45:18,819
All in due time.

2147
02:45:19,700 --> 02:45:21,059
So many things are going to go wrong here.

2148
02:45:21,700 --> 02:45:22,200
You know what?

2149
02:45:22,200 --> 02:45:22,520
I don't care.

2150
02:45:22,520 --> 02:45:23,959
Just fucking come down now.

2151
02:45:23,959 --> 02:45:24,440
Let's go.

2152
02:45:24,440 --> 02:45:24,920
All of you.

2153
02:45:24,920 --> 02:45:27,350
Now, you're on the perfect spot.

2154
02:45:27,350 --> 02:45:28,309
One, two, three.

2155
02:45:28,309 --> 02:45:28,629
Come on.

2156
02:45:28,629 --> 02:45:29,670
Down, down, down, down, down.

2157
02:45:29,670 --> 02:45:30,069
All of you.

2158
02:45:30,069 --> 02:45:30,389
Everybody.

2159
02:45:30,389 --> 02:45:31,590
Down, down, down, down, down, down.

2160
02:45:31,590 --> 02:45:31,829
Good.

2161
02:45:33,180 --> 02:45:41,129
He just dragged across the whole game.

2162
02:45:41,129 --> 02:45:41,770
Oh, shit.

2163
02:45:41,770 --> 02:45:42,729
Don't be the wall here.

2164
02:45:49,100 --> 02:45:49,579
All right.

2165
02:45:49,579 --> 02:45:50,299
That was pretty clean.

2166
02:45:52,200 --> 02:45:53,719
Everything could always be better, but that was fine.

2167
02:45:54,280 --> 02:46:02,069
It's just a Taurus demon.

2168
02:46:02,069 --> 02:46:02,629
Oh, fuck.

2169
02:46:04,680 --> 02:46:06,040
The boogie man's coming to get me.

2170
02:46:19,610 --> 02:46:19,850
What?

2171
02:46:22,059 --> 02:46:22,620
Hold on.

2172
02:46:22,620 --> 02:46:22,860
What?

2173
02:46:24,700 --> 02:46:25,739
Is that Gwyn?

2174
02:46:31,770 --> 02:46:32,969
It's actually Gwyn.

2175
02:46:34,489 --> 02:46:35,370
He's serious.

2176
02:46:38,180 --> 02:46:38,979
Just let me get it.

2177
02:46:56,889 --> 02:46:57,209
All right.

2178
02:46:57,209 --> 02:46:59,209
This is possible, but it's own.

2179
02:47:01,540 --> 02:47:02,260
I have to.

2180
02:47:03,059 --> 02:47:04,899
I have to kill the Taurus demon immediately.

2181
02:47:05,620 --> 02:47:10,180
I have to kill.

2182
02:47:10,180 --> 02:47:11,860
It's going to be like four or five swings.

2183
02:47:11,860 --> 02:47:12,739
He has to die immediately.

2184
02:47:17,350 --> 02:47:18,870
And then I have to just start parrying Gwyn.

2185
02:47:21,159 --> 02:47:23,559
Oh, go fuck up Gwyn first because he's T-posing.

2186
02:47:23,559 --> 02:47:24,280
That's very.

2187
02:47:24,280 --> 02:47:25,479
Yeah, that's not a bad idea either.

2188
02:47:43,799 --> 02:47:47,500
I hope I can kill him while he's standing there.

2189
02:47:55,290 --> 02:47:55,850
Come on.

2190
02:47:55,850 --> 02:47:57,930
Two, three, four, five.

2191
02:47:57,930 --> 02:47:58,569
Bring him down.

2192
02:47:59,209 --> 02:47:59,450
Good.

2193
02:48:12,700 --> 02:48:14,139
You have to be sitting in the door right here.

2194
02:48:16,260 --> 02:48:17,540
Could you be anywhere else?

2195
02:48:17,540 --> 02:48:18,899
I mean, and I'm talking anywhere.

2196
02:48:18,899 --> 02:48:20,180
I'm talking about fucking anywhere.

2197
02:48:23,579 --> 02:48:23,899
This is bad.

2198
02:48:24,700 --> 02:48:28,579
Oh, here the dragon is.

2199
02:48:30,180 --> 02:48:32,180
How did you fit in here?

2200
02:48:32,739 --> 02:48:35,540
There's no way you can even fit up here.

2201
02:48:35,540 --> 02:48:39,780
And yet you walked up the stairs normally, very casually.

2202
02:48:47,690 --> 02:48:49,290
I'm going to try this one more time.

2203
02:48:49,290 --> 02:48:49,610
That's it.

2204
02:48:50,329 --> 02:48:52,729
And then I'm going down to like the skeleton zone.

2205
02:48:53,370 --> 02:49:08,489
Here comes a meltdown.

2206
02:49:08,489 --> 02:49:09,129
No, you can't.

2207
02:49:09,129 --> 02:49:11,530
There's no such thing as a meltdown on a randomizer stream.

2208
02:49:21,670 --> 02:49:22,870
You can't melt down here.

2209
02:49:23,510 --> 02:49:24,629
None of this is in my control.

2210
02:49:25,430 --> 02:49:27,879
Two, three, there they go.

2211
02:49:27,879 --> 02:49:28,360
All right, let's go.

2212
02:49:28,920 --> 02:49:39,959
You had to leave that one.

2213
02:49:39,959 --> 02:49:41,079
How dare you?

2214
02:49:41,079 --> 02:49:42,360
The dragon's out coming up here.

2215
02:49:42,360 --> 02:49:42,760
I see him.

2216
02:49:42,760 --> 02:49:43,319
He's making a...

2217
02:49:44,200 --> 02:49:44,520
What?

2218
02:49:45,399 --> 02:49:48,920
How the fuck did you already get up here?

2219
02:49:49,959 --> 02:49:52,040
Get out of my fucking way.

2220
02:49:53,079 --> 02:49:53,399
No.

2221
02:49:57,540 --> 02:50:01,059
Why do they have to take up every space?

2222
02:50:08,790 --> 02:50:10,069
I have to go up there.

2223
02:50:10,870 --> 02:50:33,579
Just skip to Blighttown with the master key.

2224
02:50:36,700 --> 02:50:38,219
If you kill Gwyn, you beat the game.

2225
02:50:39,190 --> 02:50:40,950
I'm going to try to hammer him as much as I can.

2226
02:50:41,590 --> 02:50:47,829
Like just...

2227
02:50:47,829 --> 02:50:49,190
I'm going to go kill everything first.

2228
02:50:50,360 --> 02:50:51,159
And then I'm going to pull it.

2229
02:50:51,159 --> 02:50:52,600
I'm going to do it the way that I did it before.

2230
02:50:57,940 --> 02:50:58,420
Come on in.

2231
02:50:58,979 --> 02:50:59,459
Let's go.

2232
02:50:59,459 --> 02:51:00,180
Like turn the corner.

2233
02:51:00,180 --> 02:51:02,020
You can do the same dumb thing over and over again.

2234
02:51:02,899 --> 02:51:10,520
Okay.

2235
02:51:10,520 --> 02:51:11,159
Who's next?

2236
02:51:11,159 --> 02:51:12,040
There's a rat too.

2237
02:51:12,840 --> 02:51:16,780
Anybody else fit through there?

2238
02:51:18,090 --> 02:51:18,729
No.

2239
02:51:18,729 --> 02:51:19,049
Okay.

2240
02:51:20,579 --> 02:51:21,059
Let's go.

2241
02:51:21,700 --> 02:51:37,059
Come on.

2242
02:51:37,059 --> 02:51:37,700
I need you to fall.

2243
02:51:37,700 --> 02:51:38,659
This is why I didn't...

2244
02:51:38,659 --> 02:51:40,340
This is why it doesn't work that well.

2245
02:51:40,979 --> 02:51:48,469
Slug?

2246
02:51:49,030 --> 02:51:53,159
I can skip the slug.

2247
02:51:54,360 --> 02:51:55,639
You punk.

2248
02:51:55,639 --> 02:51:56,520
You've got to be kidding me.

2249
02:51:56,520 --> 02:51:58,920
Why would you turn at that exact moment?

2250
02:52:00,729 --> 02:52:03,450
The exact moment that I needed to go through that door.

2251
02:52:11,459 --> 02:52:11,620
No.

2252
02:52:11,620 --> 02:52:12,579
No meltdowns.

2253
02:52:12,579 --> 02:52:13,819
I'm good.

2254
02:52:13,819 --> 02:52:15,020
I'm going to go straight through.

2255
02:52:15,020 --> 02:52:16,379
I'm going to try to kill Gwyn as fast as I can.

2256
02:52:39,459 --> 02:52:39,860
Wait.

2257
02:52:39,860 --> 02:52:40,739
Will he kill him?

2258
02:52:43,100 --> 02:52:43,899
I don't think he will.

2259
02:52:57,860 --> 02:52:58,420
Oh shit.

2260
02:52:58,420 --> 02:52:59,219
Don't activate him.

2261
02:53:01,579 --> 02:53:02,219
What?

2262
02:53:02,219 --> 02:53:04,340
What was that?

2263
02:53:04,340 --> 02:53:15,899
Okay.

2264
02:53:15,899 --> 02:53:16,780
Let's go back.

2265
02:53:16,780 --> 02:53:18,219
I'm trying to pull him as far away as I can.

2266
02:53:19,260 --> 02:53:20,299
Don't jump off the edge.

2267
02:53:20,299 --> 02:53:21,020
I don't want to fight him.

2268
02:53:35,989 --> 02:53:37,510
Cut off Gwyn's tail.

2269
02:53:37,510 --> 02:53:38,309
Gwyn is...

2270
02:53:42,229 --> 02:53:42,629
Hold on.

2271
02:53:42,629 --> 02:53:43,030
Hold on.

2272
02:53:50,059 --> 02:53:51,579
Is this actually hurting him though?

2273
02:53:52,379 --> 02:54:06,170
Kill the demon now.

2274
02:54:06,889 --> 02:54:18,520
He just killed him.

2275
02:54:18,520 --> 02:54:19,239
He killed him.

2276
02:54:19,239 --> 02:54:19,879
I didn't kill him.

2277
02:54:20,440 --> 02:54:27,659
Why can he not hurt me?

2278
02:54:27,659 --> 02:54:36,950
What?

2279
02:54:36,950 --> 02:54:37,670
Oh.

2280
02:54:37,670 --> 02:54:40,329
I...

2281
02:54:40,969 --> 02:54:43,420
I'm like flipping.

2282
02:54:43,420 --> 02:54:44,459
I can't.

2283
02:54:44,459 --> 02:54:44,780
Fuck.

2284
02:54:47,129 --> 02:54:48,889
I thought he couldn't hurt me.

2285
02:54:48,889 --> 02:54:50,010
He was like swinging.

2286
02:54:51,110 --> 02:54:51,989
Why am I parrying?

2287
02:54:51,989 --> 02:54:54,920
Because my brain wanted to...

2288
02:54:54,920 --> 02:54:55,559
I don't know.

2289
02:54:56,440 --> 02:54:57,079
I'm going down.

2290
02:54:57,719 --> 02:54:59,700
When he killed...

2291
02:55:03,620 --> 02:55:05,219
When he killed the Taurus demon,

2292
02:55:05,219 --> 02:55:06,100
it like freaked me out.

2293
02:55:06,100 --> 02:55:06,819
And then all of a sudden,

2294
02:55:06,819 --> 02:55:20,469
I get to fight the last boss in the game

2295
02:55:20,469 --> 02:55:21,590
on the fucking tower.

2296
02:55:22,309 --> 02:55:34,899
Let's go.

2297
02:55:34,899 --> 02:55:35,540
I'm going to go down here.

2298
02:55:57,000 --> 02:55:57,399
Idea.

2299
02:55:57,399 --> 02:55:58,440
Have the master key.

2300
02:55:58,440 --> 02:55:59,879
So why the hell wouldn't I just go here?

2301
02:56:16,889 --> 02:56:17,290
Okay.

2302
02:56:17,290 --> 02:56:22,870
Well, nobody seems to be doing anything.

2303
02:56:22,870 --> 02:56:24,870
So this is a perfect opportunity to like pick up stuff.

2304
02:56:37,639 --> 02:56:38,760
Go to the smith.

2305
02:56:38,760 --> 02:56:39,559
I can't.

2306
02:56:39,559 --> 02:56:42,200
I have to kill Gwyn to unlock the smith.

2307
02:56:43,239 --> 02:56:58,889
That's...

2308
02:56:58,889 --> 02:56:59,209
Isn't that...

2309
02:56:59,209 --> 02:57:00,090
That's a boss.

2310
02:57:00,090 --> 02:57:00,969
I don't want that to happen.

2311
02:57:01,610 --> 02:57:03,030
Wait, the smith...

2312
02:57:03,030 --> 02:57:03,590
The giant?

2313
02:57:03,590 --> 02:57:04,149
Wait.

2314
02:57:04,149 --> 02:57:05,590
Am I mixing three games together?

2315
02:57:07,610 --> 02:57:08,889
Oh, the Giants and Dark Souls 3.

2316
02:57:13,690 --> 02:57:14,889
What the hell is pendant?

2317
02:57:14,889 --> 02:57:25,270
Oh, it doesn't do anything.

2318
02:57:26,229 --> 02:57:28,979
Who's down there?

2319
02:57:28,979 --> 02:57:30,100
I don't know.

2320
02:57:30,100 --> 02:57:31,059
Who is any fucking idea?

2321
02:57:36,950 --> 02:57:37,670
Actually, no.

2322
02:57:37,670 --> 02:57:38,870
I know who you guys are talking about.

2323
02:57:38,870 --> 02:57:39,430
Yeah.

2324
02:57:39,430 --> 02:57:40,149
Nah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2325
02:57:40,149 --> 02:57:40,870
This guy down here.

2326
02:57:52,100 --> 02:57:58,500
I still can't even upgrade this.

2327
02:57:59,299 --> 02:58:08,149
What do you got for items?

2328
02:58:08,950 --> 02:58:10,409
Murakumo.

2329
02:58:10,409 --> 02:58:15,190
Gauntlet of thorns.

2330
02:58:24,010 --> 02:58:25,530
I'm putting all my points into

2331
02:58:26,170 --> 02:58:26,649
strength.

2332
02:58:27,530 --> 02:58:30,340
The Sorcerer's Catalyst.

2333
02:58:33,059 --> 02:58:35,299
Why is this 500,000 sold?

2334
02:58:45,219 --> 02:58:46,420
Very, very rare.

2335
02:58:47,540 --> 02:58:49,959
I need Twinkling Titanite if I have any chance.

2336
02:58:49,959 --> 02:58:50,840
I already defined like a...

2337
02:58:51,719 --> 02:58:52,440
Buy the sword?

2338
02:58:53,239 --> 02:58:57,129
How much was it?

2339
02:58:58,069 --> 02:58:58,950
Should I get that sword?

2340
02:58:58,950 --> 02:58:59,270
But I...

2341
02:58:59,909 --> 02:59:00,469
My strength...

2342
02:59:00,469 --> 02:59:01,350
I have no...

2343
02:59:01,350 --> 02:59:01,829
I can't even...

2344
02:59:08,709 --> 02:59:09,909
Yeah, it does cost nothing.

2345
02:59:09,909 --> 02:59:10,709
You're right.

2346
02:59:10,709 --> 02:59:12,149
Well, here's the thing though.

2347
02:59:12,790 --> 02:59:14,420
I don't think I can even put it on.

2348
02:59:15,059 --> 02:59:20,040
I need 13 decks.

2349
02:59:20,840 --> 02:59:22,899
I can't even like use the damn thing.

2350
02:59:23,780 --> 02:59:32,469
A lot of people want me to use the Dark Hand.

2351
02:59:40,920 --> 02:59:42,760
But nah, this is just doing way more damage.

2352
02:59:44,569 --> 02:59:45,450
Use it as a shield?

2353
02:59:47,270 --> 02:59:47,989
All right.

2354
02:59:47,989 --> 02:59:49,030
Where the hell do I want to go?

2355
02:59:49,909 --> 02:59:51,770
Try just fight Artorias.

2356
02:59:52,729 --> 02:59:54,010
No, that would be a mistake.

2357
03:00:00,489 --> 03:00:01,049
No balls.

2358
03:00:30,020 --> 03:00:30,739
What?

2359
03:00:30,739 --> 03:00:31,719
Where is he?

2360
03:00:39,829 --> 03:00:40,469
Get him to fall?

2361
03:00:40,469 --> 03:00:41,030
That's the plan.

2362
03:00:41,670 --> 03:00:50,950
Crash.

2363
03:00:53,909 --> 03:00:54,629
It's dead.

2364
03:00:54,629 --> 03:01:03,379
Oh well.

2365
03:01:03,379 --> 03:01:10,920
Let's reroll it again.

2366
03:01:10,920 --> 03:01:11,639
Except this time.

2367
03:01:12,979 --> 03:01:13,459
I'm going...

2368
03:01:14,659 --> 03:01:16,020
I'm gonna go nuts here.

2369
03:01:16,020 --> 03:01:25,350
Let's see if I can do it.

2370
03:01:25,350 --> 03:01:26,709
I'm gonna do all Pinwheel.

2371
03:01:26,709 --> 03:01:36,780
Replace normal enemies with Pinwheel.

2372
03:01:36,780 --> 03:01:38,780
Replace NPCs with Pinwheel.

2373
03:01:38,780 --> 03:01:44,649
Let's open the config here.

2374
03:01:45,510 --> 03:01:47,989
Disable all and only Pinwheel.

2375
03:01:48,549 --> 03:01:50,379
The thing is I have to find Pinwheel.

2376
03:01:50,940 --> 03:01:56,459
This is gonna be the ultimate run.

2377
03:02:00,520 --> 03:02:01,399
Pinwheel.

2378
03:02:01,399 --> 03:02:02,120
Pinwheel.

2379
03:02:02,120 --> 03:02:02,680
Where...

2380
03:02:02,680 --> 03:02:03,239
Pinwheel.

2381
03:02:03,239 --> 03:02:03,799
There we go.

2382
03:02:05,909 --> 03:02:06,149
Done?

2383
03:02:07,940 --> 03:02:08,260
Okay.

2384
03:02:21,819 --> 03:02:26,969
I wonder if I can even walk like 20 feet.

2385
03:02:26,969 --> 03:02:34,709
This is gonna be fucking so stupid.

2386
03:02:35,350 --> 03:02:37,270
But that's what we're doing here, right?

2387
03:02:37,270 --> 03:02:38,229
That's why we're doing this.

2388
03:02:38,950 --> 03:02:46,520
Where am I gonna end up?

2389
03:02:52,469 --> 03:02:53,030
That's alright.

2390
03:02:53,750 --> 03:02:56,260
How scared am I?

2391
03:02:57,530 --> 03:02:57,850
Eh.

2392
03:02:58,569 --> 03:02:59,690
I think maybe like a four.

2393
03:03:00,649 --> 03:03:13,700
Well, one of them already died.

2394
03:03:13,700 --> 03:03:14,500
I didn't have to do anything.

2395
03:03:20,329 --> 03:03:21,850
Pinwheel, easiest boss in the game.

2396
03:03:32,219 --> 03:03:34,219
That's not Pinwheel, okay?

2397
03:03:34,219 --> 03:03:35,899
Why is that here?

2398
03:03:35,899 --> 03:03:37,020
That's not Pinwheel.

2399
03:03:37,020 --> 03:03:38,219
I selected Pinwheel.

2400
03:03:40,309 --> 03:03:41,430
This is not Pinwheel.

2401
03:03:43,180 --> 03:03:43,899
Weirdly enough.

2402
03:03:50,889 --> 03:03:53,370
It's all bosses, but none of them are Pinwheel.

2403
03:04:00,090 --> 03:04:01,770
That doesn't make any sense.

2404
03:04:02,329 --> 03:04:03,129
Oh god.

2405
03:04:03,850 --> 03:04:06,489
Why would I come to Blighttown of all places?

2406
03:04:17,579 --> 03:04:18,540
Look at this shit.

2407
03:04:24,579 --> 03:04:25,139
Jump off?

2408
03:04:25,139 --> 03:04:26,260
I'm not gonna jump off.

2409
03:04:29,100 --> 03:04:30,540
This is fucking terrible.

2410
03:04:34,969 --> 03:04:35,530
I don't...

2411
03:04:35,530 --> 03:04:37,209
Did it not save properly?

2412
03:04:53,829 --> 03:04:54,389
Pinwheel...

2413
03:04:55,270 --> 03:04:55,750
Clones...

2414
03:04:56,229 --> 03:05:05,219
I don't even remember how to get down.

2415
03:05:07,579 --> 03:05:08,620
Oh, Jesus.

2416
03:05:10,309 --> 03:05:28,950
Um, I haven't even collected any items.

2417
03:05:28,950 --> 03:05:30,229
I have so many souls.

2418
03:05:38,299 --> 03:05:38,940
Oh, fuck.

2419
03:05:41,020 --> 03:05:42,860
That was right next to my head.

2420
03:05:43,579 --> 03:05:48,069
Kick him off!

2421
03:05:48,069 --> 03:05:48,469
Kick him!

2422
03:05:56,379 --> 03:06:00,120
Um, um, um...

2423
03:06:00,120 --> 03:06:00,440
Down...

2424
03:06:07,540 --> 03:06:08,180
Wait.

2425
03:06:08,180 --> 03:06:16,620
Is this a mimic?

2426
03:06:21,430 --> 03:06:22,469
I can upgrade the sword.

2427
03:06:29,639 --> 03:06:30,040
Finally.

2428
03:06:30,040 --> 03:06:30,680
Thank god.

2429
03:06:30,680 --> 03:06:31,000
Alright.

2430
03:06:31,000 --> 03:06:33,000
Now, what's the safest...

2431
03:06:33,000 --> 03:06:34,920
There's so much going on the screen right now.

2432
03:06:34,920 --> 03:06:44,170
This is a bone home.

2433
03:06:44,170 --> 03:06:44,569
Not yet.

2434
03:06:45,209 --> 03:06:53,739
I am sweating right now.

2435
03:06:55,020 --> 03:06:55,340
Bad.

2436
03:06:56,139 --> 03:07:04,020
Yeah, you're right.

2437
03:07:04,020 --> 03:07:04,579
You're right.

2438
03:07:04,579 --> 03:07:04,979
You know you're right.

2439
03:07:04,979 --> 03:07:05,620
You guys are right.

2440
03:07:05,620 --> 03:07:06,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2441
03:07:06,100 --> 03:07:07,139
Let's get out of here.

2442
03:07:07,139 --> 03:07:08,659
I'm gonna level off like fucking 30 times.

2443
03:07:09,860 --> 03:07:17,829
Okay.

2444
03:07:43,049 --> 03:07:43,370
No!

2445
03:07:44,170 --> 03:07:45,959
I fell off the shite.

2446
03:07:47,100 --> 03:07:48,139
That's the voice we had.

2447
03:07:48,139 --> 03:07:48,940
Didn't you all know it?

2448
03:08:00,280 --> 03:08:00,600
Okay.

2449
03:08:01,239 --> 03:08:02,100
What is that?

2450
03:08:03,979 --> 03:08:04,540
Who is that?

2451
03:08:06,059 --> 03:08:06,540
Found him!

2452
03:08:07,260 --> 03:08:17,579
Let's go, you motherfucker.

2453
03:08:18,299 --> 03:08:19,260
You and me!

2454
03:08:19,260 --> 03:08:28,229
No, no, no.

2455
03:08:28,229 --> 03:08:28,629
Not good.

2456
03:08:33,350 --> 03:08:33,670
Shit.

2457
03:08:43,459 --> 03:08:44,260
God!

2458
03:08:44,260 --> 03:08:48,489
Is she dead?

2459
03:08:48,489 --> 03:08:50,489
Did she fall off?

2460
03:08:50,489 --> 03:08:50,969
She fell off.

2461
03:08:50,969 --> 03:08:51,530
Okay, she fell...

2462
03:08:51,530 --> 03:08:52,329
It's just me and him now.

2463
03:08:52,969 --> 03:09:06,090
Got him.

2464
03:09:06,090 --> 03:09:06,489
I win.

2465
03:09:20,340 --> 03:09:20,899
You didn't see?

2466
03:09:20,899 --> 03:09:22,180
What do you mean you didn't see?

2467
03:09:22,180 --> 03:09:29,799
Scripted, scripted, scripted.

2468
03:09:29,799 --> 03:09:30,360
What do you mean?

2469
03:09:30,360 --> 03:09:31,319
I don't understand what you're talking about.

2470
03:09:31,319 --> 03:09:31,719
He's dead.

2471
03:09:33,129 --> 03:09:34,329
Oh, what is that?

2472
03:09:34,329 --> 03:09:38,600
Just do it like...

2473
03:09:38,600 --> 03:09:39,879
Wait, somebody's behind me.

2474
03:09:39,879 --> 03:09:40,600
Somebody's behind me.

2475
03:09:40,600 --> 03:09:41,479
Somebody's behind me.

2476
03:09:41,479 --> 03:09:42,280
I don't know who it is.

2477
03:09:42,280 --> 03:09:42,920
Can I get out?

2478
03:09:47,209 --> 03:09:47,610
He...

2479
03:09:47,610 --> 03:09:49,610
Did he follow me?

2480
03:09:49,610 --> 03:09:50,010
Oh, no.

2481
03:09:50,010 --> 03:09:51,770
It's because I hit the reset button.

2482
03:10:00,920 --> 03:10:01,959
Oh my god.

2483
03:10:24,780 --> 03:10:25,500
What?

2484
03:10:25,500 --> 03:10:26,299
I was behind him.

2485
03:10:29,159 --> 03:10:32,659
Yeah, I can almost afford that sorcerer's staff.

2486
03:10:33,299 --> 03:10:35,930
I'll kill him again right now.

2487
03:10:36,569 --> 03:10:38,489
For the doubters.

2488
03:10:39,049 --> 03:10:43,799
Where is he?

2489
03:10:43,799 --> 03:11:15,159
I'm terrified.

2490
03:11:15,159 --> 03:11:15,879
I can't really move.

2491
03:11:21,909 --> 03:11:22,469
Where's Pinwheel?

2492
03:11:29,739 --> 03:11:30,379
This time.

2493
03:11:30,379 --> 03:11:31,500
It was for real.

2494
03:11:31,500 --> 03:11:33,049
Where's Pinwheel?

2495
03:11:39,049 --> 03:11:39,930
I need to...

2496
03:11:39,930 --> 03:11:41,290
I'm gonna be unstoppable.

2497
03:11:41,290 --> 03:11:43,290
I'm gonna level up everything into strength.

2498
03:11:44,010 --> 03:11:44,649
Into...

2499
03:11:44,649 --> 03:11:45,850
I'm gonna get to 50 strength

2500
03:11:45,850 --> 03:11:46,889
and then all hit in hell.

2501
03:12:02,149 --> 03:12:02,549
God.

2502
03:12:09,959 --> 03:12:10,600
Just let...

2503
03:12:10,600 --> 03:12:12,040
I can't touch the bonfire

2504
03:12:12,040 --> 03:12:13,239
because he's just hanging out here.

2505
03:12:14,040 --> 03:12:34,280
Where is it?

2506
03:12:34,840 --> 03:12:41,159
What are we doing?

2507
03:12:41,159 --> 03:12:41,879
What?

2508
03:12:41,879 --> 03:12:42,520
Why would it...

2509
03:12:42,520 --> 03:12:43,719
Why would it highlight no?

2510
03:12:44,520 --> 03:12:45,940
Can anyone explain to me

2511
03:12:45,940 --> 03:12:47,299
when I press use item

2512
03:12:47,299 --> 03:12:48,979
why does it highlight no?

2513
03:12:49,780 --> 03:12:50,100
First.

2514
03:12:50,739 --> 03:12:52,840
It should highlight yes.

2515
03:12:52,840 --> 03:12:53,959
Why does it highlight anything?

2516
03:12:54,760 --> 03:13:10,840
I have to go to another bonfire.

2517
03:13:10,840 --> 03:13:12,280
I have to go to another...

2518
03:13:12,280 --> 03:13:12,760
Pinwheel.

2519
03:13:13,639 --> 03:13:13,959
Wait.

2520
03:13:20,889 --> 03:13:21,209
Got it.

2521
03:13:31,100 --> 03:13:33,420
I just keep spawning.

2522
03:13:38,709 --> 03:13:41,030
I'm just gonna keep getting free souls forever.

2523
03:13:41,030 --> 03:13:42,709
I'm gonna get 99 in every step.

2524
03:13:49,110 --> 03:13:49,909
I just keep doing it.

2525
03:13:50,549 --> 03:14:05,750
This is just cheating.

2526
03:14:05,750 --> 03:14:06,790
It's just cheating.

2527
03:14:19,319 --> 03:14:19,639
All right.

2528
03:14:19,639 --> 03:14:20,280
Up to Pinwheel.

2529
03:14:20,280 --> 03:14:20,680
Let's go.

2530
03:14:20,680 --> 03:14:22,120
This time Cox ain't gonna fuck it up.

2531
03:14:42,729 --> 03:14:43,290
Dad.

2532
03:14:43,290 --> 03:14:45,620
You saw it on camera.

2533
03:14:45,620 --> 03:14:51,459
What'd he drop?

2534
03:14:51,459 --> 03:14:52,020
He dropped something.

2535
03:14:52,819 --> 03:14:53,860
Pinwheel did not kill me.

2536
03:14:53,860 --> 03:14:54,979
This is this guy killing me.

2537
03:15:11,030 --> 03:15:11,430
All right.

2538
03:15:11,430 --> 03:15:13,270
I have to get the fuck out of this.

2539
03:15:13,270 --> 03:15:30,420
What is coming out of the house?

2540
03:15:32,069 --> 03:15:34,309
This is like being inside of a hurricane.

2541
03:15:35,979 --> 03:15:37,979
I'm inside the eye of a storm right now.

2542
03:15:37,979 --> 03:15:38,780
This is a tornado

2543
03:15:38,780 --> 03:15:40,139
and a hurricane going on.

2544
03:15:40,139 --> 03:15:41,420
This is lightning striking.

2545
03:15:47,690 --> 03:15:47,850
No.

2546
03:15:48,409 --> 03:15:50,170
This is like riding a Harry Potter ride.

2547
03:15:50,170 --> 03:15:51,610
I feel like I'm riding a ride

2548
03:15:51,610 --> 03:15:53,209
at fucking Universal Studios.

2549
03:15:54,010 --> 03:15:58,520
Are they killing each other?

2550
03:15:59,159 --> 03:16:12,889
All right.

2551
03:16:12,889 --> 03:16:13,290
Let's go.

2552
03:16:13,290 --> 03:16:13,850
RT Ice.

2553
03:16:14,649 --> 03:16:45,930
Are the gargoyles dead?

2554
03:16:45,930 --> 03:16:50,489
They just...

2555
03:16:50,969 --> 03:16:52,170
What is the ice?

2556
03:16:53,049 --> 03:16:55,209
What is causing the ice wave?

2557
03:16:55,209 --> 03:16:56,649
This is too much stimulation.

2558
03:16:56,649 --> 03:16:57,129
It really is.

2559
03:17:14,520 --> 03:17:14,840
Okay.

2560
03:17:15,799 --> 03:17:18,200
So I am now going to...

2561
03:17:25,670 --> 03:17:26,309
I'm laddered.

2562
03:17:27,350 --> 03:17:30,899
Try to get Pinwheel to work.

2563
03:17:30,899 --> 03:17:32,420
So what am I doing wrong?

2564
03:17:32,420 --> 03:17:34,500
I thought everybody was supposed to be Pinwheel.

2565
03:17:55,159 --> 03:18:06,379
Get me the fuck out of here.

2566
03:18:07,420 --> 03:18:08,139
Get me out of here.

2567
03:18:10,229 --> 03:18:11,590
Let's try this again.

2568
03:18:12,629 --> 03:18:17,500
Okay.

2569
03:18:17,500 --> 03:18:17,819
So.

2570
03:18:25,450 --> 03:18:25,770
Okay.

2571
03:18:25,770 --> 03:18:28,940
Disable all and then Pinwheel.

2572
03:18:28,940 --> 03:18:31,420
And then I guess I have to save it and then load it.

2573
03:18:33,139 --> 03:18:33,780
So there.

2574
03:18:34,500 --> 03:18:36,340
Save as Pin...

2575
03:18:36,340 --> 03:18:36,739
Okay.

2576
03:18:36,739 --> 03:18:37,299
Pinwheel.

2577
03:18:37,940 --> 03:18:39,799
This should do it.

2578
03:18:41,079 --> 03:18:41,319
Okay.

2579
03:18:42,040 --> 03:18:44,680
So I need to select Pinwheel.

2580
03:18:45,239 --> 03:18:50,489
Pinwheel is selected.

2581
03:18:51,129 --> 03:18:57,819
Pinwheel.

2582
03:18:57,819 --> 03:18:58,139
All right.

2583
03:18:58,139 --> 03:18:58,940
I think we got it now.

2584
03:18:59,659 --> 03:19:08,629
Let's try it.

2585
03:19:21,000 --> 03:19:25,159
Watching the Crystal Dragon just fall into the abyss and putting his hands up.

2586
03:19:27,000 --> 03:19:27,559
That was...

2587
03:19:27,559 --> 03:19:28,920
That was a highlight of the night for me.

2588
03:19:30,569 --> 03:19:30,809
All right.

2589
03:19:30,809 --> 03:19:31,209
Let's try it.

2590
03:19:31,850 --> 03:19:36,840
It keeps going down a roller coaster.

2591
03:19:36,840 --> 03:19:37,719
Like the first drop.

2592
03:19:40,299 --> 03:19:40,700
All right.

2593
03:19:44,500 --> 03:19:44,819
Please.

2594
03:19:47,059 --> 03:19:47,379
No.

2595
03:19:47,379 --> 03:19:48,180
What the fuck?

2596
03:19:50,090 --> 03:19:51,770
It's like they never stopped.

2597
03:19:51,770 --> 03:19:52,809
They never stopped.

2598
03:20:14,899 --> 03:20:15,700
Hold on.

2599
03:20:15,700 --> 03:20:17,270
Let's try it.

2600
03:20:17,510 --> 03:20:17,909
Hold on.

2601
03:20:17,909 --> 03:20:18,389
I gotta do one...

2602
03:20:18,389 --> 03:20:19,270
Let me try one more thing.

2603
03:20:19,989 --> 03:20:23,239
All right.

2604
03:20:23,239 --> 03:20:24,440
Let's select that.

2605
03:20:24,440 --> 03:20:25,239
Get that gone.

2606
03:20:26,219 --> 03:20:26,540
Okay.

2607
03:20:27,719 --> 03:20:28,440
See if this works.

2608
03:20:33,510 --> 03:20:34,469
Now I got it.

2609
03:20:34,469 --> 03:20:35,270
This will be it I think.

2610
03:20:36,780 --> 03:20:37,340
There we go.

2611
03:20:39,110 --> 03:20:40,309
Pretty sure I just did it.

2612
03:20:41,270 --> 03:20:42,870
If not, there's one more thing I can try.

2613
03:20:42,870 --> 03:20:44,069
And if not, it might...

2614
03:20:44,069 --> 03:20:45,350
But I don't know why it won't work.

2615
03:21:05,510 --> 03:21:06,469
It's just a war.

2616
03:21:07,110 --> 03:21:10,500
I think we got it.

2617
03:21:11,219 --> 03:21:11,700
All right.

2618
03:21:11,700 --> 03:21:14,340
So if I die one time, then that's bad for my image.

2619
03:21:28,649 --> 03:21:30,090
Then I have to turn the stream off.

2620
03:21:31,620 --> 03:21:31,860
No.

2621
03:21:31,860 --> 03:21:32,340
I need to...

2622
03:21:32,340 --> 03:21:32,579
All right.

2623
03:21:32,579 --> 03:21:32,899
Let's go.

2624
03:21:33,540 --> 03:21:34,500
Let's go down to...

2625
03:21:35,540 --> 03:21:36,739
Where the fuck do I even need to go?

2626
03:21:36,739 --> 03:21:40,309
I gotta kill the stupid Taurus...

2627
03:21:40,309 --> 03:21:40,629
I gotta...

2628
03:21:40,629 --> 03:21:40,790
No.

2629
03:21:40,790 --> 03:21:42,870
I gotta kill the pinwheel guardians.

2630
03:21:42,870 --> 03:21:44,469
The pinwheel gargoyles.

2631
03:21:44,469 --> 03:21:45,860
I'm just gonna...

2632
03:21:45,860 --> 03:21:46,979
I have to run all the way back.

2633
03:22:00,090 --> 03:22:20,620
Get the most important speedrun of all.

2634
03:22:40,440 --> 03:22:40,840
All right.

2635
03:22:40,840 --> 03:22:45,610
Almost there.

2636
03:22:45,610 --> 03:22:46,809
I'm not going to die.

2637
03:22:47,610 --> 03:22:49,690
It is almost impossible for me to lose this.

2638
03:22:55,670 --> 03:22:56,870
It's two pinwheels.

2639
03:22:58,020 --> 03:22:59,299
And I have 50 strength.

2640
03:22:59,299 --> 03:22:59,700
But I don't...

2641
03:22:59,700 --> 03:23:01,139
This is not even an upgraded weapon.

2642
03:23:03,620 --> 03:23:04,420
That's the one problem.

2643
03:23:04,420 --> 03:23:05,620
This is not an upgraded weapon.

2644
03:23:05,620 --> 03:23:06,979
Can I even climb this without getting hit?

2645
03:23:11,159 --> 03:23:11,879
I don't...

2646
03:23:11,879 --> 03:23:14,120
Guys, I may as well have one Estus.

2647
03:23:14,120 --> 03:23:16,440
Because I have to drink the whole thing to fill a health bar.

2648
03:23:17,159 --> 03:23:17,879
He's making excuses...

2649
03:23:17,879 --> 03:23:19,079
I am making excuses already.

2650
03:23:19,719 --> 03:23:25,620
All right.

2651
03:23:25,620 --> 03:23:26,020
Here we go.

2652
03:23:33,899 --> 03:23:34,139
All right.

2653
03:23:34,139 --> 03:23:36,059
I'm kind of freaking out because this is so...

2654
03:23:36,059 --> 03:23:37,659
This is so easy.

2655
03:23:50,940 --> 03:23:51,500
I did...

2656
03:23:51,500 --> 03:23:52,299
But I got a mushroom.

2657
03:23:52,299 --> 03:23:53,579
I just skipped it accidentally.

2658
03:23:58,360 --> 03:23:59,399
Ring the bell.

2659
03:23:59,399 --> 03:24:01,500
I'm gonna beat this whole game tonight.

2660
03:24:02,139 --> 03:24:02,940
What do you think about that?

2661
03:24:12,059 --> 03:24:17,180
By the way, here is the stipulation for the rest of this particular thing that I'm doing here.

2662
03:24:17,180 --> 03:24:18,299
If I die, the run's over.

2663
03:24:19,180 --> 03:24:20,700
Or I have to get to the end.

2664
03:24:20,700 --> 03:24:21,420
I have to beat the game.

2665
03:24:26,870 --> 03:24:28,469
You want me to start from scratch with this?

2666
03:24:40,659 --> 03:24:43,139
No, because everybody wants me to lose all my stats.

2667
03:24:45,959 --> 03:24:46,200
No.

2668
03:24:48,680 --> 03:24:49,639
That's not part of the deal.

2669
03:24:50,200 --> 03:24:54,260
All right.

2670
03:24:54,260 --> 03:24:55,219
Let's go down.

2671
03:24:55,219 --> 03:25:16,979
Get some of that new gear.

2672
03:25:16,979 --> 03:25:17,700
Oh yeah, that's right.

2673
03:25:18,260 --> 03:25:27,739
Oh, he doesn't need to just do that.

2674
03:25:27,739 --> 03:25:30,229
I thought he was T-posing.

2675
03:25:30,229 --> 03:25:30,549
All right.

2676
03:25:30,549 --> 03:25:31,030
Pardon me.

2677
03:25:33,139 --> 03:25:33,940
Request.

2678
03:25:33,940 --> 03:25:34,579
Absolution.

2679
03:25:35,059 --> 03:25:38,340
I don't have enough money.

2680
03:25:38,979 --> 03:25:47,510
Look at this thing.

2681
03:25:47,510 --> 03:25:48,860
Grant?

2682
03:25:49,500 --> 03:25:55,540
All this stuff is bare...

2683
03:25:55,540 --> 03:25:56,659
This stuff is all pretty much free.

2684
03:26:26,680 --> 03:26:27,479
Learn gesture.

2685
03:26:28,200 --> 03:26:28,680
I will.

2686
03:26:30,040 --> 03:26:30,360
All right.

2687
03:26:30,360 --> 03:26:31,079
Learn T-pose.

2688
03:26:31,079 --> 03:26:32,200
Now I can do it with my friends.

2689
03:26:33,239 --> 03:26:34,280
And I still can't do this.

2690
03:26:35,319 --> 03:26:37,159
Well, oh well.

2691
03:26:38,920 --> 03:26:41,540
You can make a new character without deleting this one.

2692
03:26:41,540 --> 03:26:42,020
Yeah, I can.

2693
03:26:49,159 --> 03:26:49,399
Pull?

2694
03:26:49,399 --> 03:26:50,120
What do you mean pull?

2695
03:26:50,120 --> 03:26:50,600
Pull, pull.

2696
03:26:50,600 --> 03:26:51,000
We gotta...

2697
03:26:51,000 --> 03:26:51,319
You wanna...

2698
03:26:51,319 --> 03:26:52,360
Wait, what do you mean pull?

2699
03:26:53,239 --> 03:26:55,940
Now let...

2700
03:26:55,940 --> 03:26:57,139
I'm gonna do the pull.

2701
03:26:57,139 --> 03:26:57,860
Let me do the pull.

2702
03:26:57,860 --> 03:26:58,340
It's my...

2703
03:26:58,340 --> 03:26:59,059
I'm gonna do the pull.

2704
03:26:59,620 --> 03:27:00,579
No, that pull doesn't count.

2705
03:27:00,579 --> 03:27:01,219
That pull...

2706
03:27:01,219 --> 03:27:01,620
I'll do one.

2707
03:27:01,620 --> 03:27:01,940
I'm gonna go...

2708
03:27:01,940 --> 03:27:02,979
Look, we haven't gone pee.

2709
03:27:02,979 --> 03:27:03,860
It's been three and a half hours.

2710
03:27:03,860 --> 03:27:04,579
Let's go to the bathroom.

2711
03:27:07,829 --> 03:27:09,350
I can keep this character.

2712
03:27:23,639 --> 03:27:24,520
I can keep this character.

2713
03:27:28,899 --> 03:27:29,459
All right, here you go.

2714
03:27:30,180 --> 03:27:36,360
We need some official rules.

2715
03:27:36,360 --> 03:27:38,120
I think you should start with normal enemies

2716
03:27:38,120 --> 03:27:40,040
and bosses only as pinwheel

2717
03:27:40,040 --> 03:27:41,639
until you ring the first bell.

2718
03:27:41,639 --> 03:27:42,760
Then pinwheel all.

2719
03:27:42,760 --> 03:27:44,440
We're gonna get like super deep with this.

2720
03:27:49,879 --> 03:27:50,120
All right.

2721
03:27:50,120 --> 03:27:51,000
Well, I'm gonna pee.

2722
03:27:51,000 --> 03:27:51,639
I'll be right back.

2723
03:27:52,899 --> 03:27:53,540
We'll see what happens.

2724
03:29:57,500 --> 03:29:57,899
All right.

2725
03:29:59,239 --> 03:30:00,760
So I'm gonna save this character.

2726
03:30:00,760 --> 03:30:02,440
It looks like majority has ruled here.

2727
03:30:04,200 --> 03:30:05,639
I'm gonna implement some rules, though.

2728
03:30:06,440 --> 03:30:12,100
This is gonna be some important rules.

2729
03:30:15,000 --> 03:30:16,360
Yes, that's exactly what it's gonna do.

2730
03:30:16,360 --> 03:30:18,440
Rats for enemies, pinwheel for all bosses.

2731
03:30:19,000 --> 03:30:25,659
I'm gonna try to beat this game as fast as I can.

2732
03:30:28,520 --> 03:30:30,280
By the way, I get to die three times.

2733
03:30:30,280 --> 03:30:31,079
I get three lives.

2734
03:30:41,639 --> 03:30:43,319
If I die three times before...

2735
03:30:43,319 --> 03:30:44,360
Okay, let's put it this way.

2736
03:30:44,360 --> 03:30:45,000
Hold on a second.

2737
03:30:45,639 --> 03:30:47,399
I'm not gonna beat the entire game

2738
03:30:47,399 --> 03:30:48,760
with pinwheels and rats.

2739
03:30:48,760 --> 03:30:50,870
That's gonna just get boring.

2740
03:30:50,870 --> 03:30:52,229
I have to beat three pinwheels.

2741
03:30:52,229 --> 03:30:56,889
I have to...

2742
03:30:56,889 --> 03:30:57,930
No, you only get to die once.

2743
03:30:59,139 --> 03:31:00,020
All right, fine.

2744
03:31:00,020 --> 03:31:01,780
If I die once, then it's over.

2745
03:31:01,780 --> 03:31:04,739
I have to beat at least three pinwheels.

2746
03:31:05,459 --> 03:31:07,270
All right, here we go.

2747
03:31:07,270 --> 03:31:08,229
Let me just save this.

2748
03:31:09,110 --> 03:31:15,159
Make a new character.

2749
03:31:15,159 --> 03:31:16,040
Put a timer on.

2750
03:31:16,920 --> 03:31:17,989
What do you mean?

2751
03:31:17,989 --> 03:31:19,510
Why do I need a timer for this?

2752
03:31:19,510 --> 03:31:20,309
How long do I get?

2753
03:31:20,950 --> 03:31:27,850
Like, guys, I don't even remember

2754
03:31:27,850 --> 03:31:29,370
half the ways to go in this game.

2755
03:31:29,370 --> 03:31:30,729
You think I'm gonna beat this whole game

2756
03:31:30,729 --> 03:31:31,610
in an hour or two?

2757
03:31:32,170 --> 03:31:35,510
All right, let's go do it.

2758
03:31:39,139 --> 03:31:39,540
All right.

2759
03:31:42,200 --> 03:31:45,239
Replace normal enemies only with normal enemies.

2760
03:31:46,120 --> 03:31:47,719
And then the normal enemies are gonna be rats.

2761
03:31:48,360 --> 03:31:50,040
Replace NPCs.

2762
03:31:50,040 --> 03:31:51,399
Do not replace NPCs.

2763
03:31:51,399 --> 03:31:53,239
Or should I replace NPCs with pinwheels?

2764
03:31:58,780 --> 03:32:00,219
No, do not replace NPCs.

2765
03:32:02,309 --> 03:32:03,670
All right, fully randomized.

2766
03:32:04,760 --> 03:32:05,639
They can be anywhere.

2767
03:32:08,069 --> 03:32:08,950
All right, this looks good.

2768
03:32:08,950 --> 03:32:10,469
Now I'm gonna open up the config.

2769
03:32:10,469 --> 03:32:13,110
Let's put on pinwheel.

2770
03:32:13,989 --> 03:32:15,909
And small rat, rat...

2771
03:32:16,469 --> 03:32:18,469
Large rat and snow rat are active.

2772
03:32:29,819 --> 03:32:30,620
That looks good.

2773
03:32:33,399 --> 03:32:35,079
All bosses are gonna be replaced with boss,

2774
03:32:35,079 --> 03:32:37,000
and pinwheel is the only one that's selectable,

2775
03:32:37,000 --> 03:32:37,639
so this should work.

2776
03:32:38,280 --> 03:32:42,520
Let's go.

2777
03:32:43,079 --> 03:32:55,639
By the way, dying to a rat does not count.

2778
03:32:55,639 --> 03:32:57,239
Dying to a pinwheel ends the whole run.

2779
03:33:05,829 --> 03:33:09,430
And I may, I may need to...

2780
03:33:09,430 --> 03:33:09,909
It depends.

2781
03:33:09,909 --> 03:33:10,709
Let's see.

2782
03:33:10,709 --> 03:33:14,059
It depends on if a new character is a random roll

2783
03:33:14,059 --> 03:33:15,579
or if it's all the same random.

2784
03:33:16,940 --> 03:33:17,579
Let's find out.

2785
03:33:18,709 --> 03:33:20,229
I might start with the same equipment.

2786
03:33:25,909 --> 03:33:26,790
Yeah, let's see.

2787
03:33:26,790 --> 03:33:27,750
I'm gonna have to change equipment.

2788
03:33:43,739 --> 03:33:44,299
Pinhead.

2789
03:33:45,260 --> 03:33:46,299
Pinhead is pretty good.

2790
03:33:47,100 --> 03:33:59,000
I'm gonna be knight.

2791
03:34:02,229 --> 03:34:03,350
You have to pick the class?

2792
03:34:03,350 --> 03:34:04,389
Deprived.

2793
03:34:04,389 --> 03:34:10,340
Why do you guys get to pick?

2794
03:34:10,899 --> 03:34:24,379
A hair.

2795
03:34:24,379 --> 03:34:26,059
I don't know, let me go to customize.

2796
03:34:27,100 --> 03:34:36,620
All right, that's fine.

2797
03:34:47,379 --> 03:34:49,719
Here it goes.

2798
03:34:51,719 --> 03:34:52,520
Rat!

2799
03:34:52,520 --> 03:34:55,659
That's not a rat.

2800
03:34:58,100 --> 03:34:58,819
What the fuck is that?

2801
03:35:01,620 --> 03:35:13,139
It's not a rat?

2802
03:35:16,549 --> 03:35:17,909
Why are they all these...

2803
03:35:17,909 --> 03:35:19,190
Why is this happening?

2804
03:35:19,190 --> 03:35:34,409
Let me see.

2805
03:35:34,409 --> 03:35:35,450
Did I have something wrong here?

2806
03:35:36,569 --> 03:35:36,969
Shouldn't be.

2807
03:35:39,799 --> 03:35:40,440
It's on...

2808
03:35:40,440 --> 03:35:42,200
The profile is set to...

2809
03:35:45,049 --> 03:35:46,409
It's on pinwheel.

2810
03:35:47,129 --> 03:35:52,579
Pinwheel.

2811
03:35:53,219 --> 03:35:54,579
It's selected, okay.

2812
03:35:54,579 --> 03:35:57,700
That's rat, small rat, snow rat, and then pinwheel and that's it.

2813
03:35:58,260 --> 03:35:58,899
It's selected.

2814
03:35:59,540 --> 03:36:06,250
So that should be fine.

2815
03:36:07,209 --> 03:36:13,319
Hmm.

2816
03:36:13,319 --> 03:36:22,170
Replace normal enemies only with normal enemies.

2817
03:36:22,809 --> 03:36:28,040
Replace bosses with bosses and I have them selected.

2818
03:36:28,680 --> 03:36:37,209
Is the beginning just an exception?

2819
03:36:37,209 --> 03:36:37,770
It might be.

2820
03:36:39,500 --> 03:36:39,979
Hold on.

2821
03:36:44,920 --> 03:36:45,799
All right, here we go.

2822
03:36:45,799 --> 03:36:46,840
This is probably what's going on.

2823
03:36:52,729 --> 03:36:54,489
Enemy boss can be placed anywhere in the world.

2824
03:36:54,489 --> 03:36:57,049
Yes, you can find things like madness in the asylum.

2825
03:36:57,049 --> 03:36:57,290
Okay.

2826
03:36:57,850 --> 03:36:59,850
I think I had like a little lock on it.

2827
03:36:59,850 --> 03:37:00,969
Let's try it.

2828
03:37:01,610 --> 03:37:12,229
Okay.

2829
03:37:12,229 --> 03:37:16,299
And I'm on pinwheel config.

2830
03:37:17,340 --> 03:37:21,379
Should do it.

2831
03:37:21,379 --> 03:37:21,780
Let's go.

2832
03:37:26,280 --> 03:37:28,680
If this doesn't work, then I'm not sure what else to do.

2833
03:37:29,399 --> 03:37:35,799
We might have to just go back to the other file and say sorry.

2834
03:37:37,239 --> 03:37:41,059
You got a 300 word essay due tomorrow.

2835
03:37:41,860 --> 03:37:44,100
Dude, get on that.

2836
03:37:44,100 --> 03:37:44,739
What are you doing here?

2837
03:37:45,700 --> 03:37:48,600
It worked.

2838
03:37:48,600 --> 03:37:49,319
All right, we're good.

2839
03:37:50,120 --> 03:37:52,979
So begins the run.

2840
03:37:53,700 --> 03:37:57,510
300 word...

2841
03:37:57,510 --> 03:37:57,909
That's not...

2842
03:37:57,909 --> 03:37:58,629
Yeah, that's like...

2843
03:37:59,270 --> 03:38:04,389
You've probably written more words in chat today than you will for your essay.

2844
03:38:04,950 --> 03:38:15,579
Will I do you math homework?

2845
03:38:15,579 --> 03:38:16,059
Yeah, what is it?

2846
03:38:16,700 --> 03:38:19,780
Give me a problem.

2847
03:38:20,500 --> 03:38:24,979
There he is.

2848
03:38:24,979 --> 03:38:25,620
He's already up there.

2849
03:38:25,620 --> 03:38:26,100
I see him.

2850
03:38:31,879 --> 03:38:32,360
See ya.

2851
03:38:33,079 --> 03:38:40,549
It's a 2016 meme.

2852
03:38:41,190 --> 03:38:45,479
Am I really getting grabbed by old 2016 meme?

2853
03:38:45,479 --> 03:38:46,360
Is that happening to me?

2854
03:38:47,159 --> 03:38:56,180
Got the hammer.

2855
03:38:56,739 --> 03:38:58,219
All right, let's go.

2856
03:38:59,100 --> 03:39:06,739
Blood shield.

2857
03:39:06,739 --> 03:39:07,620
What does a blood shield do?

2858
03:39:08,579 --> 03:39:11,510
All right, let's go.

2859
03:39:11,510 --> 03:39:12,709
Kill the first pinwheel.

2860
03:39:13,670 --> 03:39:23,370
Gives resistance.

2861
03:39:23,370 --> 03:39:23,850
Oh, I see.

2862
03:39:34,840 --> 03:39:35,079
Thanks.

2863
03:39:35,719 --> 03:39:45,559
This is going to be actually pretty easy.

2864
03:39:46,840 --> 03:39:51,420
The only thing I have to worry about is the first two pinwheels are going to be hard

2865
03:39:51,420 --> 03:39:51,899
because...

2866
03:39:53,020 --> 03:39:57,020
Why is he up here now?

2867
03:39:57,020 --> 03:39:58,659
He shouldn't be up here now.

2868
03:40:04,860 --> 03:40:07,420
Yeah, the first two pinwheels are going to be hard because I have no stats.

2869
03:40:08,139 --> 03:40:15,850
Where's his health bar?

2870
03:40:16,409 --> 03:40:17,690
Oh, he doesn't even exist yet.

2871
03:40:17,690 --> 03:40:18,010
I have to...

2872
03:40:18,010 --> 03:40:18,329
Hold on.

2873
03:40:18,889 --> 03:40:26,100
Where'd he go?

2874
03:40:26,100 --> 03:40:32,440
This is just going to hurt me.

2875
03:40:43,479 --> 03:40:45,000
All right, here we go.

2876
03:40:52,069 --> 03:40:53,270
I thought that was going to hit me.

2877
03:40:53,989 --> 03:41:13,159
He's stuck.

2878
03:41:13,159 --> 03:41:14,200
He's stuck in a time loop.

2879
03:41:14,200 --> 03:41:14,680
I can kill him.

2880
03:41:19,159 --> 03:41:20,280
He's so fucked up.

2881
03:41:22,280 --> 03:41:23,319
First pinwheel down.

2882
03:41:25,559 --> 03:41:27,399
The first of at least two.

2883
03:41:28,120 --> 03:41:33,850
Take the humanity.

2884
03:41:33,850 --> 03:41:34,170
Thank you.

2885
03:41:35,770 --> 03:41:36,969
Level one, one.

2886
03:41:37,690 --> 03:41:46,500
Hold on.

2887
03:41:46,500 --> 03:41:47,139
Give me a second.

2888
03:41:47,940 --> 03:41:49,700
I have to be right back real quick.

2889
03:41:49,700 --> 03:41:52,549
I got to talk to Kim about something very quickly.

2890
03:41:52,549 --> 03:41:53,590
I'll be right back.

2891
03:41:53,590 --> 03:43:19,159
All right, we're good.

2892
03:43:19,159 --> 03:43:19,799
Sorry about that.

2893
03:43:21,909 --> 03:43:23,110
We're good.

2894
03:43:25,780 --> 03:43:27,299
Weirdly enough, for some reason,

2895
03:43:27,459 --> 03:43:37,030
uh, the ceiling light in our bedroom like crashed just fell down.

2896
03:43:37,030 --> 03:43:37,510
I don't know how.

2897
03:43:38,729 --> 03:43:39,770
So everything's fine.

2898
03:43:39,770 --> 03:43:43,459
It just don't ask me how that happened.

2899
03:43:43,459 --> 03:43:44,260
A fucking ghost.

2900
03:43:48,299 --> 03:43:49,420
Uh, yeah, I'll put those on.

2901
03:43:50,379 --> 03:43:52,680
Is the eagle shield better?

2902
03:43:53,319 --> 03:43:56,950
What was that?

2903
03:43:56,950 --> 03:44:02,760
Somebody's shooting at me?

2904
03:44:03,319 --> 03:44:07,819
Whatever, let's go.

2905
03:44:07,819 --> 03:44:08,700
All right, speed run time.

2906
03:44:08,700 --> 03:44:14,870
Let's hurry.

2907
03:44:14,870 --> 03:44:17,030
Oh, it's the pinwheel that's downstairs.

2908
03:44:20,739 --> 03:44:21,299
This should...

2909
03:44:21,860 --> 03:44:22,579
Actually, you know what?

2910
03:44:23,399 --> 03:44:25,079
I will beat this tonight.

2911
03:44:25,239 --> 03:44:26,760
I'm going to beat the whole game tonight.

2912
03:44:26,760 --> 03:44:27,719
You know why that is?

2913
03:44:27,719 --> 03:44:39,860
Because I'm simply just going to run to every pinwheel.

2914
03:44:39,860 --> 03:44:41,620
This is not going to take more than like 30 minutes.

2915
03:44:47,159 --> 03:44:49,399
All these items are in the same spot, though.

2916
03:44:49,399 --> 03:44:51,559
That's the only problem here.

2917
03:44:52,360 --> 03:44:53,079
All right, what?

2918
03:44:53,079 --> 03:44:53,719
Doesn't matter.

2919
03:44:53,719 --> 03:44:54,040
I'm going.

2920
03:44:54,040 --> 03:44:54,520
Let's go.

2921
03:44:54,520 --> 03:44:55,159
Go, hurry up.

2922
03:44:58,600 --> 03:44:59,799
30 minutes on no balls.

2923
03:44:59,799 --> 03:45:00,520
Time it.

2924
03:45:00,520 --> 03:45:00,760
Fine.

2925
03:45:01,559 --> 03:45:15,590
How do I do that?

2926
03:45:15,590 --> 03:45:20,809
I don't think I can add one.

2927
03:45:21,370 --> 03:45:33,340
Here we go.

2928
03:45:33,340 --> 03:45:34,620
I got one.

2929
03:45:34,620 --> 03:45:46,790
So I got, uh, let's say one hour.

2930
03:45:46,790 --> 03:45:49,610
This should do it.

2931
03:45:49,610 --> 03:45:50,489
I said 30 minutes.

2932
03:45:51,290 --> 03:45:51,930
That's too bad.

2933
03:45:52,729 --> 03:45:53,530
One hour.

2934
03:45:53,530 --> 03:46:00,420
If I don't beat this in an hour, then I have lost a pinwheel.

2935
03:46:00,420 --> 03:46:01,700
I will accept it.

2936
03:46:01,700 --> 03:46:05,379
But I'm just going to literally jump down the hole and kill like the speedrun strategy.

2937
03:46:05,940 --> 03:46:09,299
All right, here we go.

2938
03:46:09,299 --> 03:46:10,500
Let me add this source.

2939
03:46:11,139 --> 03:46:16,739
Where is it?

2940
03:46:21,659 --> 03:46:35,059
I need this to be in Chrome because Firefox can't be pulled.

2941
03:46:35,059 --> 03:46:35,540
I forgot.

2942
03:46:40,649 --> 03:46:41,930
Cane and lynch rules.

2943
03:46:41,930 --> 03:46:44,489
No, I'm not doing a cane and lynch rule set here.

2944
03:46:45,129 --> 03:46:47,100
I'm doing one hour.

2945
03:46:47,739 --> 03:46:48,219
How about this?

2946
03:46:48,219 --> 03:46:51,500
Okay, if I kill at least five pinwheels in an hour, I win.

2947
03:46:51,500 --> 03:47:07,479
I might not even be able to get all the way through.

2948
03:47:07,479 --> 03:47:09,319
It's pretty possible that I might not do this at all.

2949
03:47:09,879 --> 03:47:34,489
Pinwheel percent.

2950
03:47:34,489 --> 03:47:35,850
All right, let's get this a little smaller.

2951
03:47:36,489 --> 03:47:38,520
All right, you ready?

2952
03:47:43,340 --> 03:48:18,250
In three, two, one, go.

2953
03:48:18,250 --> 03:48:21,290
All right, can I make the, can I make the rats smaller?

2954
03:48:21,290 --> 03:48:23,020
This is not fair.

2955
03:48:23,020 --> 03:48:26,920
They take up so much space.

2956
03:48:27,799 --> 03:48:28,840
That doesn't count.

2957
03:48:29,959 --> 03:48:30,760
That doesn't count.

2958
03:48:30,760 --> 03:48:31,479
It really doesn't.

2959
03:48:39,639 --> 03:48:41,799
I can die to it as many times as I want to a rat.

2960
03:48:51,270 --> 03:48:52,950
They're really just going to blow this whole thing.

2961
03:48:54,170 --> 03:48:55,370
Oh, god damn it.

2962
03:48:57,260 --> 03:48:58,139
Bye, all of you.

2963
03:48:58,139 --> 03:48:58,940
Okay, what's this item?

2964
03:48:59,739 --> 03:49:11,100
Five pinwheels, right?

2965
03:49:11,100 --> 03:49:12,139
That's all I need.

2966
03:49:12,139 --> 03:49:24,620
What do you mean no?

2967
03:49:24,620 --> 03:49:29,049
Why does this one have like rot all over it?

2968
03:49:29,049 --> 03:49:30,860
Is this a pig?

2969
03:49:30,860 --> 03:49:31,579
This is not even a rat.

2970
03:49:31,579 --> 03:49:32,059
This is a pig.

2971
03:49:32,780 --> 03:49:39,350
Nice random items.

2972
03:49:39,350 --> 03:49:39,829
More shit.

2973
03:49:57,079 --> 03:49:58,280
These are just a nuisance.

2974
03:49:58,280 --> 03:50:01,319
I've come to, that did so much fucking damage.

2975
03:50:01,319 --> 03:50:02,600
It's unbelievable.

2976
03:50:02,600 --> 03:50:05,379
I, can I get rid of the rats?

2977
03:50:05,379 --> 03:50:07,139
Can I please get rid of the snow rat

2978
03:50:07,139 --> 03:50:08,500
that does all your health in one hit?

2979
03:50:22,090 --> 03:50:23,370
No, I can do five.

2980
03:50:41,159 --> 03:50:55,370
Take off the leg armor, recall.

2981
03:50:55,370 --> 03:50:56,409
Leave these things alone.

2982
03:50:56,409 --> 03:50:57,770
They do so much damage.

2983
03:50:57,770 --> 03:51:08,219
The rats are harder than pinwheel.

2984
03:51:08,219 --> 03:51:10,069
I'm going to lose again.

2985
03:51:10,069 --> 03:51:12,889
I'm going to get hit again.

2986
03:51:12,889 --> 03:51:13,850
This is such a mess.

2987
03:51:14,729 --> 03:51:21,670
Because then he's going to stuff his face over here and die.

2988
03:51:22,729 --> 03:51:23,930
Oh, he fell off the edge.

2989
03:51:28,299 --> 03:51:30,299
Guys, it's fucking stupid.

2990
03:51:30,940 --> 03:51:31,979
I can't even move.

2991
03:51:32,780 --> 03:51:45,219
I would have had this better off all of them being pinwheel.

2992
03:51:45,860 --> 03:52:00,889
Give me the item.

2993
03:52:00,889 --> 03:52:01,770
Just dropped an item.

2994
03:52:01,770 --> 03:52:02,889
You rolled all the way.

2995
03:52:02,889 --> 03:52:04,090
You can't be serious.

2996
03:52:04,649 --> 03:52:07,750
Make them all small rats.

2997
03:52:07,750 --> 03:52:08,629
Yeah, can I make them all?

2998
03:52:09,780 --> 03:52:11,059
If I can't get up there again, I don't care.

2999
03:52:11,059 --> 03:52:11,379
I'm doing it.

3000
03:52:11,379 --> 03:52:12,500
I'm making them all small rats.

3001
03:52:31,479 --> 03:52:32,520
Pickaxe, nice.

3002
03:52:32,520 --> 03:52:49,260
What's the timer for?

3003
03:52:49,260 --> 03:52:50,540
Uh, for me to beat the game.

3004
03:52:50,540 --> 03:52:54,260
Me beating the game is killing pinwheel five times.

3005
03:52:54,260 --> 03:53:02,170
I've already done it once, so four more times.

3006
03:53:02,170 --> 03:53:03,530
This time I'm going to be ready.

3007
03:53:03,530 --> 03:53:06,649
Because these people, the guy, they aggro from over here.

3008
03:53:07,290 --> 03:53:08,250
Just wait it out.

3009
03:53:36,040 --> 03:53:36,600
Fuck it, just go.

3010
03:53:41,670 --> 03:53:42,229
Seriously.

3011
03:53:59,530 --> 03:54:01,049
All right, I got the first bonfire.

3012
03:54:01,690 --> 03:54:04,389
Touch it.

3013
03:54:04,389 --> 03:54:07,530
Just let him in.

3014
03:54:07,530 --> 03:54:09,129
I can't, that's not going to happen.

3015
03:54:09,129 --> 03:54:11,379
What do I want to do?

3016
03:54:11,379 --> 03:54:53,819
Uh, it doesn't count if I die to rats.

3017
03:54:53,819 --> 03:55:04,620
You can't help it.

3018
03:55:04,620 --> 03:55:06,219
Get out of the way.

3019
03:55:06,219 --> 03:55:10,469
Please leave me the fuck alone.

3020
03:55:14,780 --> 03:55:15,280
No.

3021
03:55:16,729 --> 03:55:18,250
They're just obstacles.

3022
03:55:19,610 --> 03:55:20,569
They don't even attack.

3023
03:55:20,569 --> 03:55:23,930
The giant rats are just fucking annoying obstacles.

3024
03:55:23,930 --> 03:55:24,409
I'm dead.

3025
03:55:25,209 --> 03:55:52,459
Get over here, you motherfucker.

3026
03:55:53,260 --> 03:56:02,379
The snow rats are actually later game enemies.

3027
03:56:03,340 --> 03:56:04,139
What was I thinking?

3028
03:56:04,940 --> 03:56:17,770
Okay, give me.

3029
03:56:19,590 --> 03:56:22,729
You actually attacked this time.

3030
03:56:23,450 --> 03:56:49,350
I can skip a bunch of that shit.

3031
03:56:49,350 --> 03:56:51,989
I just skipped like, I skipped like fucking 20% of the game.

3032
03:56:52,629 --> 03:57:16,340
Okay, just, just go.

3033
03:57:16,340 --> 03:57:22,459
How much time?

3034
03:57:22,459 --> 03:57:30,739
50 minutes?

3035
03:57:30,739 --> 03:57:31,540
I want to get up there.

3036
03:57:31,540 --> 03:57:33,139
No, don't even, just go.

3037
03:57:33,139 --> 03:57:34,500
Pinwheel is the easiest thing in the game.

3038
03:57:34,500 --> 03:57:35,780
It's almost impossible to lose.

3039
03:57:36,579 --> 03:57:38,020
I just have to get through the rats.

3040
03:57:45,139 --> 03:57:45,940
Somebody do it.

3041
03:57:48,549 --> 03:57:49,909
My fucking god.

3042
03:58:13,139 --> 03:58:19,819
There he is, pinwheel number two.

3043
03:58:19,819 --> 03:58:20,319
Come here.

3044
03:58:24,579 --> 03:58:26,020
I teleported all the way back here?

3045
03:58:27,719 --> 03:58:29,479
Oh shit, I forgot about the rats.

3046
03:58:30,040 --> 03:58:34,379
That's like the fucking real bots.

3047
03:58:37,479 --> 03:58:38,520
Watch out for the fireball.

3048
03:58:39,319 --> 03:59:25,049
I need, I need to, I'm just doing all endurance.

3049
03:59:25,049 --> 03:59:31,059
On to the gargoyles.

3050
03:59:31,059 --> 03:59:40,579
Sometimes they drop an item.

3051
03:59:40,579 --> 03:59:41,059
Okay, let's go.

3052
03:59:41,700 --> 03:59:58,790
I have to beat the whole game.

3053
03:59:59,750 --> 04:00:13,909
I'm working on it.

3054
04:00:13,909 --> 04:00:15,270
It's, it's going to be pinwheel, right?

3055
04:00:20,420 --> 04:00:21,700
Pinwheel is just going to be hanging out up top?

3056
04:00:27,659 --> 04:00:28,860
Yep, he's just hanging out up there.

3057
04:00:30,649 --> 04:00:31,450
Sorcerer's Cloak.

3058
04:00:53,940 --> 04:00:54,440
Die.

3059
04:00:54,899 --> 04:01:06,489
Another pickaxe.

3060
04:01:06,489 --> 04:01:09,370
You're doing speedrun prevention tactics.

3061
04:01:09,370 --> 04:01:10,090
Oh, I'm aware.

3062
04:01:11,049 --> 04:01:13,430
Uh, strength and dex.

3063
04:01:13,430 --> 04:01:13,909
Which one?

3064
04:01:13,909 --> 04:01:14,409
Strength.

3065
04:01:14,950 --> 04:01:18,360
I need to be doing, I need to do a little bit more damage.

3066
04:01:18,360 --> 04:01:30,629
I need, um, what's with all the dumb shit stuff?

3067
04:01:30,629 --> 04:01:31,270
This is boring.

3068
04:01:32,360 --> 04:01:33,479
I want items.

3069
04:01:33,479 --> 04:01:34,120
Whatever, run.

3070
04:01:34,920 --> 04:01:41,879
40, 46 minutes?

3071
04:01:42,520 --> 04:02:04,379
Why would I ever select to have big rats?

3072
04:02:05,180 --> 04:02:10,940
Looking for items.

3073
04:02:13,239 --> 04:02:14,120
No, fuck the rats.

3074
04:02:14,760 --> 04:02:16,579
Just get the items and run.

3075
04:02:23,770 --> 04:02:24,489
Chain leggings.

3076
04:02:25,129 --> 04:02:29,459
That may have been a mistake.

3077
04:02:30,420 --> 04:02:31,459
Willard just showed up.

3078
04:02:34,549 --> 04:02:35,670
Oh, god damn it.

3079
04:02:37,739 --> 04:02:38,540
Please, no.

3080
04:02:39,340 --> 04:02:41,979
No, he's going to fill the door, isn't he?

3081
04:02:42,620 --> 04:02:48,600
I thought he was going to run right into the door.

3082
04:03:09,219 --> 04:03:11,540
Just try to block my screen.

3083
04:03:12,420 --> 04:03:36,709
Oh, no, it's king rat.

3084
04:03:36,709 --> 04:03:38,069
They're fucking everywhere, man.

3085
04:03:39,670 --> 04:03:41,829
I, I, I'm going to give it the shortcut.

3086
04:03:42,389 --> 04:03:43,899
I'm going to need it.

3087
04:03:43,899 --> 04:03:59,659
I know this is a waste of time, but I want to, I can just skip it.

3088
04:03:59,659 --> 04:04:30,010
Let's go.

3089
04:04:30,010 --> 04:04:30,569
Left close.

3090
04:04:36,180 --> 04:04:38,500
You have to beat actual pinwheel last.

3091
04:04:38,500 --> 04:04:39,459
That's not part of the deal.

3092
04:04:45,690 --> 04:04:46,969
Your goal is five pinwheels.

3093
04:04:46,969 --> 04:04:51,930
So if you fight the rat goils and go below the blacks, but that's all five.

3094
04:04:52,649 --> 04:04:55,719
I need that master key.

3095
04:04:55,719 --> 04:04:56,520
Oh, shit.

3096
04:04:59,319 --> 04:04:59,879
I'll get it later.

3097
04:05:00,520 --> 04:05:02,889
I don't have time for that.

3098
04:05:23,690 --> 04:05:26,250
Oh, oh, no, they fill in the doors.

3099
04:05:32,809 --> 04:05:34,649
The rats were the worst decision.

3100
04:05:36,090 --> 04:05:37,770
I think the rats may be the worst decision.

3101
04:05:45,129 --> 04:05:45,690
Impossible.

3102
04:05:46,409 --> 04:05:47,049
This is impossible.

3103
04:05:47,989 --> 04:05:49,430
Whatever this item is, just what is it?

3104
04:05:49,430 --> 04:05:49,930
Sorcery.

3105
04:05:58,219 --> 04:06:01,100
I have to clear this whole room of rats because the giant rats

3106
04:06:01,899 --> 04:06:04,540
are going to make it impossible for me to run fast.

3107
04:06:05,180 --> 04:06:16,069
I need more strength.

3108
04:06:16,709 --> 04:06:24,579
That was just a drop in the bucket right there.

3109
04:06:24,579 --> 04:06:25,139
What do I need?

3110
04:06:28,469 --> 04:06:29,750
24 and 13.

3111
04:06:29,750 --> 04:06:31,030
24, 24 strength.

3112
04:06:31,030 --> 04:06:31,750
I can, I can do that.

3113
04:06:40,969 --> 04:06:42,250
What a great speed run.

3114
04:06:42,250 --> 04:06:42,729
Yeah.

3115
04:06:42,729 --> 04:06:44,250
Oh, good speed run.

3116
04:06:44,250 --> 04:06:45,209
Saving frames here.

3117
04:06:45,930 --> 04:07:22,979
Master key.

3118
04:07:22,979 --> 04:07:24,340
What the fuck just happened?

3119
04:07:25,829 --> 04:07:26,870
I hate this.

3120
04:07:26,870 --> 04:07:27,829
Why did that happen?

3121
04:07:27,829 --> 04:07:29,670
I just bumped my head and fell backwards.

3122
04:07:32,920 --> 04:07:34,120
I don't know why that happened.

3123
04:07:36,219 --> 04:07:37,739
It bounced me backwards.

3124
04:07:38,299 --> 04:07:39,739
Why did that happen?

3125
04:07:42,950 --> 04:07:44,469
It doesn't even make any sense.

3126
04:07:45,110 --> 04:07:46,870
You couldn't do that if you all,

3127
04:07:46,870 --> 04:07:48,549
if you all loaded up Dark Souls right now

3128
04:07:48,549 --> 04:07:50,309
and tried to just do what I did.

3129
04:07:51,110 --> 04:07:52,149
It wouldn't be possible.

3130
04:08:04,950 --> 04:08:06,149
My hand fucking slipped.

3131
04:08:06,149 --> 04:08:06,950
This is what I wanted to do.

3132
04:08:06,950 --> 04:08:07,909
I forgot about these items.

3133
04:08:08,469 --> 04:08:16,979
There's my strength.

3134
04:08:17,620 --> 04:08:23,989
Okay, go.

3135
04:08:23,989 --> 04:08:38,420
Okay, let me go back around.

3136
04:08:39,139 --> 04:08:51,819
Break the soul.

3137
04:08:51,819 --> 04:09:03,690
Get the strength.

3138
04:09:03,690 --> 04:09:04,729
Optimal route.

3139
04:09:04,729 --> 04:09:05,129
It's all right.

3140
04:09:05,129 --> 04:09:05,770
I'm good.

3141
04:09:05,770 --> 04:09:15,750
I'm gonna need two.

3142
04:09:16,629 --> 04:09:27,719
I need more than that.

3143
04:09:28,440 --> 04:09:39,399
What happened? 38 minutes?

3144
04:09:39,399 --> 04:09:46,040
Uh, I'd lose.

3145
04:09:46,040 --> 04:09:48,840
I have to clear the rats though.

3146
04:09:48,840 --> 04:09:49,639
Use my souls.

3147
04:09:50,280 --> 04:09:51,879
What do you, what do you mean?

3148
04:09:52,440 --> 04:09:59,059
I don't have to, I gotta go.

3149
04:09:59,059 --> 04:09:59,780
I don't have time for this.

3150
04:09:59,780 --> 04:10:00,180
I gotta go.

3151
04:10:00,180 --> 04:10:01,299
I, there's just no time for this shit.

3152
04:10:07,700 --> 04:10:08,420
Use the greatsword.

3153
04:10:08,420 --> 04:10:09,219
I'm using the axe.

3154
04:10:09,219 --> 04:10:16,889
Because this has a, uh, how about this?

3155
04:10:16,889 --> 04:10:17,850
Will this be good?

3156
04:10:17,850 --> 04:10:36,340
It's one hit.

3157
04:10:36,340 --> 04:10:36,899
Okay.

3158
04:10:36,899 --> 04:10:38,020
That's pretty great actually.

3159
04:10:38,020 --> 04:10:38,340
Let's go.

3160
04:11:11,020 --> 04:11:12,139
Dark Hand doesn't have enough,

3161
04:11:12,139 --> 04:11:13,659
they're all stuffing through here.

3162
04:11:13,659 --> 04:11:26,860
This is fucking hell.

3163
04:11:32,979 --> 04:11:34,659
They're just gonna chase me up the stairs, guys.

3164
04:11:39,350 --> 04:11:41,350
I don't, I hate the rats.

3165
04:11:42,149 --> 04:11:43,989
They're ruining this whole thing.

3166
04:11:43,989 --> 04:11:59,319
It's just, it's these snow rats.

3167
04:11:59,319 --> 04:12:02,040
They're like fucking DLC rats.

3168
04:12:02,040 --> 04:12:03,879
And they're killing this run.

3169
04:12:03,879 --> 04:12:14,500
I knew they were behind me.

3170
04:12:14,500 --> 04:12:14,979
I knew it.

3171
04:12:14,979 --> 04:12:16,420
Look at how many snow rats.

3172
04:12:16,420 --> 04:12:17,379
It's not even fair.

3173
04:12:17,940 --> 04:12:19,139
There's too many snow rats.

3174
04:12:19,700 --> 04:12:38,100
And pinwheel is like, I could,

3175
04:12:38,100 --> 04:12:39,860
I could close my eyes and take a bath.

3176
04:12:41,670 --> 04:12:43,510
It's these dumb snow rats that I put in.

3177
04:12:59,829 --> 04:13:00,389
Do something.

3178
04:13:07,370 --> 04:13:08,489
I'm gonna have a lot of shit.

3179
04:13:09,129 --> 04:13:13,500
All right, time?

3180
04:13:13,500 --> 04:13:14,139
34 minutes.

3181
04:13:14,780 --> 04:13:32,469
I'm almost halfway done with the game.

3182
04:13:41,670 --> 04:13:44,549
I get to add like 30 seconds to the time because of the cutscene.

3183
04:13:44,549 --> 04:13:55,459
I know I can skip, but I want to see this.

3184
04:13:55,459 --> 04:14:02,940
Is that his teeth?

3185
04:14:02,940 --> 04:14:19,590
That's his insides.

3186
04:14:19,590 --> 04:14:21,590
Yeah, I think that's his intestines or something.

3187
04:14:40,379 --> 04:14:41,020
Not today.

3188
04:14:45,590 --> 04:14:46,090
Uh-oh.

3189
04:14:47,079 --> 04:14:47,579
Uh-oh.

3190
04:14:58,059 --> 04:14:59,340
I gotta stop panicking right now.

3191
04:14:59,340 --> 04:15:01,020
I'm like freaking out because

3192
04:15:01,020 --> 04:15:02,139
everyone's laughing in the chat.

3193
04:15:02,139 --> 04:15:03,420
I can feel you laughing at me.

3194
04:15:32,379 --> 04:15:33,659
He's really close to the edge though,

3195
04:15:33,659 --> 04:15:34,780
and I don't want to go over there.

3196
04:15:34,780 --> 04:15:36,170
I'm gonna wait till he disappears.

3197
04:15:36,170 --> 04:15:36,969
I'm gonna kick him off the edge.

3198
04:15:37,770 --> 04:15:38,649
Will he fall off the edge?

3199
04:15:39,370 --> 04:15:41,709
Please.

3200
04:15:42,250 --> 04:15:53,030
Just kill the motherfucker.

3201
04:16:07,430 --> 04:16:14,139
How did that miss?

3202
04:16:14,139 --> 04:16:14,860
I'm good.

3203
04:16:14,860 --> 04:16:15,420
Everything.

3204
04:16:15,420 --> 04:16:16,299
Don't worry about me.

3205
04:16:17,020 --> 04:16:21,319
Ring the bell.

3206
04:16:21,319 --> 04:16:26,299
It's Twin Humanities.

3207
04:16:26,299 --> 04:16:27,040
That's it.

3208
04:16:27,579 --> 04:16:47,420
Go 10 flasks is what it took.

3209
04:16:47,420 --> 04:16:48,860
Blame the rats for that shit.

3210
04:16:48,860 --> 04:16:49,819
That's not my fault.

3211
04:16:59,340 --> 04:17:02,139
So what's the fastest way to me to get to the end of the game?

3212
04:17:02,139 --> 04:17:03,260
Like to win.

3213
04:17:03,260 --> 04:17:14,440
Oh wait, what am I doing?

3214
04:17:14,440 --> 04:17:14,920
What am I doing?

3215
04:17:14,920 --> 04:17:15,479
Why am I doing this?

3216
04:17:20,180 --> 04:17:21,219
Nah, I didn't want to use that.

3217
04:17:21,780 --> 04:17:25,049
Do the Sen's Fortress skip?

3218
04:17:25,049 --> 04:17:25,930
How do I do that?

3219
04:17:25,930 --> 04:17:40,790
Is it enough to do two-handed?

3220
04:17:41,270 --> 04:17:46,180
What do I need for two-handed?

3221
04:17:52,409 --> 04:17:53,930
I need those two decks.

3222
04:17:53,930 --> 04:17:54,250
Shit.

3223
04:17:54,809 --> 04:18:03,659
I'm using the crystal.

3224
04:18:03,659 --> 04:18:03,979
All right.

3225
04:18:03,979 --> 04:18:05,180
How do I do Sen's skip?

3226
04:18:05,819 --> 04:18:13,420
No, I seriously can't.

3227
04:18:13,420 --> 04:18:13,979
I don't know.

3228
04:18:17,819 --> 04:18:18,940
I can't do it.

3229
04:18:18,940 --> 04:18:21,690
Let's go.

3230
04:18:21,690 --> 04:18:27,450
All right, now I have to go back here and then down.

3231
04:18:28,010 --> 04:18:31,219
I gotta go.

3232
04:18:31,219 --> 04:18:33,459
No, I gotta go through with that.

3233
04:18:33,459 --> 04:18:34,899
I need that basement key.

3234
04:18:35,620 --> 04:18:43,739
Yeah, I gotta go to Blight Town.

3235
04:18:43,739 --> 04:18:55,909
I need to get that master key right now.

3236
04:18:55,909 --> 04:18:56,870
Go get it.

3237
04:18:56,870 --> 04:19:05,750
Do the Underground Asylum pinwheel?

3238
04:19:05,750 --> 04:19:06,950
No, no, no, no.

3239
04:19:06,950 --> 04:19:07,909
That's optional.

3240
04:19:07,909 --> 04:19:10,950
I gotta get the master key

3241
04:19:10,950 --> 04:19:13,110
and then I gotta go open the door and then go to Blight Town.

3242
04:19:13,750 --> 04:19:34,809
All right, let's go.

3243
04:19:34,809 --> 04:19:41,379
Whatever the fuck this is, let's get it too.

3244
04:19:47,209 --> 04:19:48,729
Can you give us a Monka S?

3245
04:19:49,450 --> 04:19:51,049
Not unless it's warranted.

3246
04:20:00,170 --> 04:20:07,500
All right, now we gotta go down from the...

3247
04:20:08,059 --> 04:20:09,659
Everything's fucking up in my brain

3248
04:20:09,659 --> 04:20:10,620
because of the dumb timer.

3249
04:20:10,620 --> 04:20:14,139
I have to go up to the blacksmith.

3250
04:20:14,860 --> 04:20:18,149
No, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down.

3251
04:20:18,790 --> 04:20:31,340
What are you...

3252
04:20:31,340 --> 04:20:49,420
What is he doing here?

3253
04:20:49,420 --> 04:20:51,100
Where was the favor of protection?

3254
04:20:52,940 --> 04:20:54,940
It's in the same spot where it was last time.

3255
04:20:54,940 --> 04:21:12,389
I have to kill that fucking asshole.

3256
04:21:12,389 --> 04:21:12,889
Sorry.

3257
04:21:13,430 --> 04:21:21,659
Yeah, I don't have time for it, you're right.

3258
04:21:21,659 --> 04:21:25,979
All right, let's go here through Blight Town.

3259
04:21:26,860 --> 04:21:28,299
Well, isn't there a way that you can jump

3260
04:21:28,299 --> 04:21:29,579
across the whole thing in Blight Town?

3261
04:21:36,760 --> 04:21:37,719
I don't know where the hell it is.

3262
04:21:37,719 --> 04:21:38,200
I don't remember.

3263
04:21:50,489 --> 04:21:52,010
You fall and then exit game.

3264
04:21:52,010 --> 04:21:52,889
Is that what you really do?

3265
04:22:00,170 --> 04:22:01,370
Like, jump all the way down there.

3266
04:22:03,590 --> 04:22:05,030
Is that actually how I do this?

3267
04:22:05,590 --> 04:22:26,010
Let me go.

3268
04:22:26,010 --> 04:22:29,139
So fall off here and then exit the game.

3269
04:22:30,809 --> 04:22:31,530
Is that true?

3270
04:22:36,170 --> 04:22:37,290
When do I have to exit the game?

3271
04:22:52,600 --> 04:22:53,319
I forgot.

3272
04:22:54,280 --> 04:22:58,840
Everything requires a confirmation in Dark Souls.

3273
04:22:58,840 --> 04:23:00,100
Quit the game.

3274
04:23:00,100 --> 04:23:00,739
Are you sure?

3275
04:23:01,379 --> 04:23:03,620
Windows user authorization services.

3276
04:23:03,620 --> 04:23:05,219
Are you sure you want to open that program?

3277
04:23:23,819 --> 04:23:26,379
So you do quit game and right before you die.

3278
04:23:34,280 --> 04:23:38,940
So you like land quit, but you can't be dead.

3279
04:23:39,500 --> 04:23:45,030
I don't have time for this.

3280
04:23:45,030 --> 04:23:45,750
You'll fuck it up again.

3281
04:23:45,750 --> 04:23:47,350
All right, you're right, you're right, you're right.

3282
04:23:47,909 --> 04:23:48,629
I'm just gonna go down.

3283
04:23:48,629 --> 04:23:49,989
I'm gonna try to go down swiftly.

3284
04:23:50,629 --> 04:23:56,680
It's at any point during the fall.

3285
04:23:56,680 --> 04:23:58,680
You have to quit as soon as you hear the scream.

3286
04:23:59,879 --> 04:24:15,750
They're lying.

3287
04:24:15,750 --> 04:24:16,469
He's lying.

3288
04:24:17,110 --> 04:24:19,909
I'm just gonna quickly get down.

3289
04:24:19,909 --> 04:24:26,620
You dumbass snow rat shitheads.

3290
04:24:27,579 --> 04:24:28,219
Leave me alone.

3291
04:24:29,180 --> 04:24:30,139
All right, quickly.

3292
04:24:30,139 --> 04:24:30,540
Let's go.

3293
04:24:31,340 --> 04:24:50,940
How do you speed through Blight Town?

3294
04:24:50,940 --> 04:24:53,700
You just like walk across.

3295
04:24:53,700 --> 04:24:55,299
And there's giant rats here too.

3296
04:24:55,299 --> 04:24:56,420
This is such a mistake.

3297
04:24:57,780 --> 04:24:58,899
Can I go across that?

3298
04:24:58,899 --> 04:25:00,579
No, I have to go down again and then across.

3299
04:25:01,780 --> 04:25:23,180
Hold circle.

3300
04:25:23,180 --> 04:25:24,139
Yeah, I'm holding circle.

3301
04:25:24,139 --> 04:25:25,100
I don't know why it's not doing it.

3302
04:25:25,739 --> 04:25:27,770
I'm like holding down circle.

3303
04:25:28,489 --> 04:25:31,049
Or B, whatever.

3304
04:25:31,049 --> 04:25:39,340
I'm down.

3305
04:25:46,809 --> 04:25:47,450
I'm doing it.

3306
04:25:47,450 --> 04:25:47,930
I'm trying.

3307
04:25:47,930 --> 04:25:48,569
It won't do it.

3308
04:25:48,569 --> 04:25:49,209
I'm trying.

3309
04:26:01,620 --> 04:26:02,180
Dick.

3310
04:26:02,180 --> 04:26:10,420
What did I, what the hell did I just do?

3311
04:26:10,420 --> 04:26:11,219
I gotta go down there.

3312
04:26:11,860 --> 04:26:24,299
It's the quickest way to, can I fall over there?

3313
04:26:24,940 --> 04:26:37,670
And then, and then from here I gotta go down.

3314
04:26:38,469 --> 04:26:40,899
Right here, come on.

3315
04:26:40,899 --> 04:26:48,219
And then there's a bonfire down here.

3316
04:26:49,510 --> 04:26:50,389
Somewhere.

3317
04:26:50,389 --> 04:26:53,610
Where the fuck is the bonfire?

3318
04:26:53,610 --> 04:26:54,409
It's like over here.

3319
04:26:55,290 --> 04:26:56,780
Yeah, it's like down here.

3320
04:27:01,020 --> 04:27:02,299
Screw the bonfire.

3321
04:27:02,299 --> 04:27:03,340
I need the bonfire.

3322
04:27:05,909 --> 04:27:06,389
Where is it?

3323
04:27:37,909 --> 04:27:39,590
If you seriously kill me,

3324
04:27:39,590 --> 04:27:41,909
the rats have the shittiest timing too.

3325
04:27:41,909 --> 04:27:43,590
They do like the little bit, bit.

3326
04:27:44,469 --> 04:27:45,829
It's the worst enemy in the game.

3327
04:27:45,829 --> 04:27:47,190
Why did I pick all rats?

3328
04:27:47,190 --> 04:27:47,989
I should have done all,

3329
04:27:47,989 --> 04:27:50,069
like what other joke could I fucking come up with?

3330
04:27:50,069 --> 04:27:53,350
How about all skeletons?

3331
04:27:53,989 --> 04:27:54,709
Funny, right?

3332
04:28:12,600 --> 04:28:14,120
And these idiots poison too.

3333
04:28:14,680 --> 04:28:20,170
I couldn't think of a stupid or fucking thing to try.

3334
04:28:20,969 --> 04:28:33,430
Leave me alone.

3335
04:28:33,430 --> 04:28:45,110
Are these all gonna be rats down here?

3336
04:28:45,110 --> 04:28:46,870
Because they're technically enemies.

3337
04:28:52,649 --> 04:28:53,690
Oh, please.

3338
04:29:18,889 --> 04:29:19,370
Here we go.

3339
04:29:26,629 --> 04:29:40,870
Why is this one on fire?

3340
04:29:40,870 --> 04:29:41,909
Demon pinwheel.

3341
04:29:57,940 --> 04:29:58,979
I thought that hit me in the head.

3342
04:30:20,020 --> 04:30:21,620
No, I'm not going to lose.

3343
04:30:21,620 --> 04:30:25,379
It's just ring the second bell

3344
04:30:25,379 --> 04:30:27,540
and then I have to go through sense fortress

3345
04:30:27,540 --> 04:30:28,899
and then I can get to the end of the game, right?

3346
04:30:51,639 --> 04:30:52,840
Okay, now let me get out.

3347
04:30:53,739 --> 04:30:56,299
Now, it's the four kings.

3348
04:31:01,260 --> 04:31:04,059
Sense fortress is like the end of the prologue chapter.

3349
04:31:07,959 --> 04:31:09,719
I have to do the four pinwheels.

3350
04:31:09,719 --> 04:31:12,309
Okay, give me out.

3351
04:31:12,309 --> 04:31:12,709
I need to.

3352
04:31:21,860 --> 04:31:23,780
I did kill five pinwheels, that's true.

3353
04:31:24,979 --> 04:31:27,909
All right, now where do I go from here?

3354
04:31:27,909 --> 04:31:28,469
We go from...

3355
04:31:29,909 --> 04:31:31,270
I'm back in Blighttown though.

3356
04:31:38,809 --> 04:31:40,090
Do the ceaseless discharge.

3357
04:31:40,090 --> 04:31:40,729
There's no time.

3358
04:32:01,399 --> 04:32:02,200
There's a chest back here.

3359
04:32:02,200 --> 04:32:03,000
Hold on.

3360
04:32:03,000 --> 04:32:08,459
This could be a game changer.

3361
04:32:09,450 --> 04:32:20,649
No, not really.

3362
04:32:20,649 --> 04:32:22,729
Go back and fight.

3363
04:32:22,729 --> 04:32:26,579
I have to go back and fight ceaseless discharge.

3364
04:32:26,579 --> 04:32:27,540
Well, hold on.

3365
04:32:27,540 --> 04:32:29,299
I have to go all the way back here.

3366
04:32:29,299 --> 04:32:30,340
Why did I bone then?

3367
04:32:30,340 --> 04:32:31,620
What was the point of me boning?

3368
04:32:32,979 --> 04:32:35,219
Somebody said bone now and I listened to them.

3369
04:32:35,860 --> 04:32:59,850
Why would you listen to us?

3370
04:32:59,850 --> 04:33:02,010
Because you guys are helpful sometimes.

3371
04:33:02,010 --> 04:33:03,690
You give me correct guidance.

3372
04:33:17,110 --> 04:33:18,709
Waste of like six minutes.

3373
04:33:19,590 --> 04:33:31,029
If we told you to jump off a cliff, would you do it?

3374
04:33:31,029 --> 04:33:33,049
No, because I know that would harm me.

3375
04:33:36,569 --> 04:33:37,689
Ceaseless is optional.

3376
04:33:40,810 --> 04:33:46,090
Yeah, but at some point I have to kill as many pinwheels in another 12 minutes.

3377
04:33:46,810 --> 04:33:55,290
And why do you think ceaseless is really optional?

3378
04:33:55,290 --> 04:34:15,020
This is the clue.

3379
04:34:15,020 --> 04:34:19,000
Hey, well, I might not do it in an hour,

3380
04:34:19,000 --> 04:34:21,479
but I could probably get this done in like another 30-40 minutes.

3381
04:34:22,119 --> 04:34:25,369
All right, let's go.

3382
04:34:25,930 --> 04:34:26,650
I gotta go down.

3383
04:34:28,099 --> 04:34:29,619
And then doesn't there look a lady down here?

3384
04:34:31,830 --> 04:34:32,330
No!

3385
04:34:59,580 --> 04:35:01,020
We had some time for the cutscenes.

3386
04:35:08,409 --> 04:35:09,610
It's not intentional.

3387
04:35:09,610 --> 04:35:11,130
I swear to God.

3388
04:35:11,130 --> 04:35:12,169
I thought I had enough health.

3389
04:35:12,729 --> 04:35:14,490
I didn't realize that because I was poisoned.

3390
04:35:14,490 --> 04:35:15,849
So I was just taking damage.

3391
04:35:15,849 --> 04:35:17,130
I wasn't paying attention to it.

3392
04:35:19,819 --> 04:35:21,389
Oh well.

3393
04:35:34,599 --> 04:35:36,840
No, I'm gonna die again because of this.

3394
04:35:37,720 --> 04:35:43,479
How did you swim through all this?

3395
04:35:43,959 --> 04:35:55,779
I fucking hate the rats.

3396
04:35:55,779 --> 04:35:56,500
I hate the dogs.

3397
04:35:57,380 --> 04:35:58,819
Dogs and rats are two of the worst.

3398
04:36:01,979 --> 04:36:06,060
This time I'm not gonna let my poison tick down

3399
04:36:06,060 --> 04:36:08,700
and not pay attention to it to a point where I die from that fucking drop.

3400
04:36:09,500 --> 04:36:20,900
I mean, there are a lot of mistakes made here.

3401
04:36:20,900 --> 04:36:24,500
One of which is having giant rats and snow rats and any rats.

3402
04:36:24,500 --> 04:36:25,540
I should have had no enemies.

3403
04:36:40,259 --> 04:36:41,459
How did the time go back up?

3404
04:36:43,560 --> 04:36:44,520
I don't know.

3405
04:36:44,520 --> 04:36:45,159
I don't know.

3406
04:36:45,880 --> 04:36:46,360
Did you come?

3407
04:36:47,240 --> 04:36:48,439
Did you go to the bathroom and come back?

3408
04:36:50,119 --> 04:36:53,939
Because maybe you thought you were gone for longer than you were.

3409
04:36:54,500 --> 04:37:22,869
I'm just a bonfire.

3410
04:37:22,869 --> 04:37:23,590
I don't care.

3411
04:37:28,599 --> 04:37:29,639
I know it's the spider lady.

3412
04:37:29,639 --> 04:37:30,119
It doesn't matter.

3413
04:37:30,680 --> 04:37:40,090
Okay, now if I remember it's...

3414
04:37:40,090 --> 04:37:40,650
Wait a minute.

3415
04:37:41,459 --> 04:37:43,459
How is this ceaseless discharge gonna exist?

3416
04:37:45,450 --> 04:37:46,650
It's just pinwheel.

3417
04:37:46,650 --> 04:37:59,290
You see him down there?

3418
04:37:59,290 --> 04:38:05,189
I don't see anything down there.

3419
04:38:05,189 --> 04:38:06,709
Watch him be like 500 feet tall.

3420
04:38:45,669 --> 04:38:57,000
I don't think this is gonna work.

3421
04:38:57,000 --> 04:38:59,159
How do I get him to spawn?

3422
04:38:59,159 --> 04:39:06,409
Didn't even get a chance to spawn.

3423
04:39:06,409 --> 04:39:07,130
He's dead.

3424
04:39:25,819 --> 04:39:28,150
All right, now I need to...

3425
04:39:29,560 --> 04:39:31,319
What's the fastest way to get the hell out of here?

3426
04:39:31,319 --> 04:39:34,009
And the fastest way...

3427
04:39:34,009 --> 04:39:36,090
What's the fastest way to get out of this?

3428
04:39:36,090 --> 04:39:42,759
Go to the altar and get the armor set.

3429
04:39:42,759 --> 04:39:43,639
It's not gonna be an armor set.

3430
04:39:43,639 --> 04:39:44,520
It's gonna be dumb.

3431
04:39:44,520 --> 04:39:51,959
There's nothing here.

3432
04:39:51,959 --> 04:39:52,360
It's gonna be...

3433
04:39:52,360 --> 04:39:55,020
It's random.

3434
04:39:55,020 --> 04:39:55,819
It's a humanity.

3435
04:39:55,819 --> 04:40:02,950
So ceaseless discharge.

3436
04:40:02,950 --> 04:40:03,270
Dead.

3437
04:40:07,020 --> 04:40:27,750
Bone and walk to the elevator and go back up.

3438
04:40:27,750 --> 04:40:28,950
Why did I do that?

3439
04:40:28,950 --> 04:40:31,270
What the fuck did I listen to people for?

3440
04:40:31,270 --> 04:40:33,290
It was right behind me.

3441
04:40:33,290 --> 04:40:33,849
I just had to...

3442
04:40:34,490 --> 04:40:35,130
I thought I...

3443
04:40:37,930 --> 04:40:39,529
I can't believe I did it again.

3444
04:40:39,529 --> 04:40:41,369
I really thought that I was, for some reason,

3445
04:40:41,369 --> 04:40:42,650
didn't rest at that bonfire.

3446
04:40:42,650 --> 04:40:43,930
Let's at least go through here.

3447
04:40:45,349 --> 04:40:45,990
Where's the...

3448
04:40:45,990 --> 04:40:47,909
Where's Quelaag's door?

3449
04:40:47,909 --> 04:40:49,270
It's like a hidden door or something.

3450
04:40:49,270 --> 04:40:49,830
Where is it?

3451
04:41:21,419 --> 04:41:22,919
All right.

3452
04:41:22,919 --> 04:41:23,560
So now...

3453
04:41:24,119 --> 04:41:24,680
Killer.

3454
04:41:24,680 --> 04:41:25,080
Killer.

3455
04:41:25,080 --> 04:41:25,639
You know you're right.

3456
04:41:25,639 --> 04:41:26,040
That's true.

3457
04:41:35,689 --> 04:41:36,330
There's not even...

3458
04:41:37,049 --> 04:41:39,290
There's not even a fucking fire soul here.

3459
04:41:40,470 --> 04:41:42,069
It's a random goddamn item.

3460
04:41:42,069 --> 04:41:42,569
Okay.

3461
04:42:08,200 --> 04:42:08,700
Let's go.

3462
04:42:09,400 --> 04:42:12,040
That doesn't count either because those aren't rats.

3463
04:42:12,040 --> 04:42:13,159
I mean, those aren't pinwheels.

3464
04:42:21,580 --> 04:42:22,299
Sen's fortress.

3465
04:42:22,299 --> 04:42:22,799
Let's go.

3466
04:42:29,590 --> 04:42:29,909
Why...

3467
04:42:29,909 --> 04:42:31,990
Why do I still give a shit about this?

3468
04:42:31,990 --> 04:42:41,299
It's been like an hour and 10 minutes.

3469
04:42:41,299 --> 04:42:43,580
Why do...

3470
04:42:43,580 --> 04:42:44,139
Why am I...

3471
04:42:44,139 --> 04:42:45,819
Why do I care about this so much?

3472
04:42:45,819 --> 04:42:50,970
Ring the bell?

3473
04:42:50,970 --> 04:42:52,299
I did, didn't I?

3474
04:42:52,299 --> 04:42:54,580
I didn't.

3475
04:42:54,580 --> 04:42:55,060
Ring the bell?

3476
04:42:55,060 --> 04:42:55,700
I...

3477
04:42:55,700 --> 04:42:56,580
I rang the bell.

3478
04:42:56,580 --> 04:42:58,939
What do you mean it didn't ring the bell?

3479
04:42:58,939 --> 04:43:00,139
That's the first thing I did when I got up here.

3480
04:43:12,250 --> 04:43:22,360
Let me go back up.

3481
04:43:22,360 --> 04:43:23,400
Do you actually didn't?

3482
04:43:23,400 --> 04:43:23,900
No.

3483
04:43:24,439 --> 04:43:25,799
You're not gonna fool me on this one.

3484
04:43:25,799 --> 04:43:26,360
I'm sorry, guys.

3485
04:43:27,939 --> 04:43:29,939
The first thing I did was pull the lever.

3486
04:43:30,819 --> 04:43:31,459
I remember...

3487
04:43:31,459 --> 04:43:32,580
I have a distinct memory.

3488
04:43:33,299 --> 04:43:39,909
I want that item.

3489
04:43:40,470 --> 04:43:58,659
Swan, let's go.

3490
04:44:01,639 --> 04:44:03,400
I'm gonna turn timer off because I don't even need it.

3491
04:44:03,400 --> 04:44:03,880
What's the point?

3492
04:44:04,599 --> 04:44:23,419
If you turn off the timer, you're admitting defeat.

3493
04:44:23,979 --> 04:44:33,880
And then we go back around.

3494
04:44:34,599 --> 04:44:38,180
What am I looking for here?

3495
04:44:38,180 --> 04:44:39,060
What am I trying to get to?

3496
04:44:39,700 --> 04:44:47,959
If I fell off right there, I would have been...

3497
04:44:47,959 --> 04:44:49,159
It would have probably been the other whole thing.

3498
04:44:49,159 --> 04:44:49,720
I would have turned it off.

3499
04:44:52,659 --> 04:44:54,979
Up all the way and then back to Sen's, right?

3500
04:44:55,779 --> 04:45:07,590
Sen's fortress should be pretty easy,

3501
04:45:07,590 --> 04:45:09,990
considering there's literally nothing besides rats.

3502
04:45:09,990 --> 04:45:10,630
But who knows?

3503
04:45:10,630 --> 04:45:11,430
That might be horrible.

3504
04:45:12,150 --> 04:45:14,069
There's something over there too, but I don't care.

3505
04:45:15,270 --> 04:45:16,229
I'm on a timer over here.

3506
04:45:18,090 --> 04:45:19,689
Yeah, there are traps, but I know where they are.

3507
04:45:20,490 --> 04:45:37,930
Jerma ain't shit.

3508
04:45:39,369 --> 04:45:43,830
Get rid of them.

3509
04:45:43,830 --> 04:45:44,630
Get rid of that person.

3510
04:45:45,189 --> 04:45:45,750
Get rid of them.

3511
04:45:52,150 --> 04:45:53,349
Don't die to poison.

3512
04:45:54,310 --> 04:45:55,430
Poison is your enemy.

3513
04:45:56,150 --> 04:46:02,759
Okay, now I need...

3514
04:46:02,759 --> 04:46:03,479
That's the way out.

3515
04:46:05,430 --> 04:46:06,069
See you later.

3516
04:46:14,709 --> 04:46:15,909
Just a couple of snow rats.

3517
04:46:16,939 --> 04:46:17,979
Don't even pay attention to them.

3518
04:46:17,979 --> 04:46:18,220
Just go.

3519
04:46:18,860 --> 04:46:21,669
I go right into you.

3520
04:46:31,139 --> 04:46:32,419
Bone now.

3521
04:46:32,419 --> 04:46:35,880
Oh, fuck.

3522
04:46:35,880 --> 04:46:36,520
Okay, no, no.

3523
04:46:36,520 --> 04:46:37,720
Seriously, like, I can't fuck this up.

3524
04:46:53,029 --> 04:46:55,909
Dying here would be an actual stream disaster.

3525
04:46:57,319 --> 04:46:58,119
All right.

3526
04:46:58,119 --> 04:46:58,520
Sen's.

3527
04:46:59,240 --> 04:47:00,119
Back through.

3528
04:47:00,680 --> 04:47:01,560
Gotta wrap around.

3529
04:47:04,330 --> 04:47:05,049
I'm gonna go the...

3530
04:47:05,049 --> 04:47:06,810
I'm just gonna go the way that I know how to go.

3531
04:47:07,450 --> 04:47:22,680
Some people are probably saying,

3532
04:47:23,720 --> 04:47:25,479
Dude, dude, boy, you're going the wrong way, man.

3533
04:47:25,479 --> 04:47:26,119
You wrapped...

3534
04:47:26,119 --> 04:47:26,680
No, you went the right way.

3535
04:47:26,680 --> 04:47:27,479
You could have gone the other way.

3536
04:47:27,479 --> 04:47:28,279
You could have gone that way.

3537
04:47:28,279 --> 04:47:29,159
And I'm like, it doesn't matter.

3538
04:47:29,159 --> 04:47:30,040
I'm gonna be fine.

3539
04:47:30,919 --> 04:47:46,599
Should I bone now?

3540
04:47:47,560 --> 04:47:48,900
This is a good time to bone.

3541
04:48:08,569 --> 04:48:12,569
Uh-oh.

3542
04:48:12,569 --> 04:48:13,369
This is bad.

3543
04:48:14,330 --> 04:48:25,400
So I have to go this way.

3544
04:48:26,040 --> 04:48:31,270
Blacksmith and then across to Sen's.

3545
04:48:31,830 --> 04:48:36,330
And to stream.

3546
04:48:36,330 --> 04:48:38,549
No, I'm going to do this.

3547
04:48:39,110 --> 04:48:44,790
I just have to kill Penguin.

3548
04:48:45,430 --> 04:49:11,500
Was there a spell in front of the...

3549
04:49:11,500 --> 04:49:19,240
I really cannot die before getting to the blacksmith.

3550
04:49:19,240 --> 04:49:21,000
You're still following me.

3551
04:49:21,000 --> 04:49:22,279
This is really, really stupid.

3552
04:49:22,279 --> 04:49:23,080
Like, hold on.

3553
04:49:37,400 --> 04:49:40,040
I can't skip Sen's because I can't parry rats.

3554
04:49:42,759 --> 04:49:43,000
Right.

3555
04:49:43,639 --> 04:49:44,520
You're right.

3556
04:49:44,520 --> 04:49:45,639
Yeah, unfortunately.

3557
04:49:46,279 --> 04:49:47,369
It's all right.

3558
04:49:47,369 --> 04:49:47,689
I got this.

3559
04:49:48,569 --> 04:50:00,810
I didn't make him like a Taurus Demon or something, right?

3560
04:50:01,450 --> 04:50:04,200
No, thank God.

3561
04:50:09,159 --> 04:50:09,880
What do I need?

3562
04:50:09,880 --> 04:50:11,159
Demon Titanite?

3563
04:50:11,159 --> 04:50:12,680
Where was the Demon Titanite?

3564
04:50:12,680 --> 04:50:13,720
Didn't the slug have it?

3565
04:50:14,279 --> 04:50:16,520
No, it's because the rats are all...

3566
04:50:17,720 --> 04:50:19,720
I'm not going to get any items to upgrade weapons.

3567
04:50:19,720 --> 04:50:21,880
I'll be seeing you, Speaker.

3568
04:50:21,880 --> 04:50:22,439
That's not good.

3569
04:50:22,439 --> 04:50:23,319
I'm not going to be able to get them.

3570
04:50:25,590 --> 04:50:26,470
It's all rats.

3571
04:50:26,470 --> 04:50:27,430
I'm just going to pick up dung.

3572
04:50:27,430 --> 04:50:28,470
That's the only thing they're going to drop.

3573
04:50:29,270 --> 04:50:31,500
Whatever.

3574
04:50:31,500 --> 04:50:31,900
Let's go.

3575
04:50:45,450 --> 04:50:47,529
You have a Gravelord sword.

3576
04:50:47,529 --> 04:50:48,650
You don't need upgrades.

3577
04:50:48,650 --> 04:50:49,130
Yes, I do.

3578
04:50:49,930 --> 04:50:51,990
You know who you're talking about here?

3579
04:51:14,169 --> 04:51:38,729
It's in the chest.

3580
04:51:41,779 --> 04:51:42,659
A regular mace.

3581
04:51:42,659 --> 04:51:43,139
That's great.

3582
04:51:52,409 --> 04:51:53,689
Did the balls that still drop?

3583
04:51:55,450 --> 04:51:56,650
No, the boulders can't drop

3584
04:51:56,650 --> 04:52:03,139
because there's no giants to drop them.

3585
04:52:03,139 --> 04:52:03,939
You gotta be kidding me.

3586
04:52:04,500 --> 04:52:18,680
This is what you do, right?

3587
04:52:18,680 --> 04:52:18,919
Yeah.

3588
04:52:33,159 --> 04:52:33,799
Oh, fuck.

3589
04:52:33,799 --> 04:52:35,240
I forgot there's some traps.

3590
04:52:35,240 --> 04:52:46,700
And then...

3591
04:52:46,700 --> 04:52:47,180
Wait, hold on.

3592
04:52:47,180 --> 04:52:48,619
I have to wait for this to come down.

3593
04:52:48,619 --> 04:52:52,729
I did know where the traps are.

3594
04:52:52,729 --> 04:53:00,279
I know where they are.

3595
04:53:07,110 --> 04:53:08,389
This is the right thing, right?

3596
04:53:20,279 --> 04:53:20,599
Okay.

3597
04:53:20,599 --> 04:53:22,279
Now, it's...

3598
04:53:22,279 --> 04:53:23,000
I have to move...

3599
04:53:23,000 --> 04:53:23,720
I have to turn this.

3600
04:53:24,599 --> 04:53:25,479
And then we go...

3601
04:53:26,360 --> 04:53:29,529
Where the fuck do we go now?

3602
04:53:33,220 --> 04:53:34,259
Up or around or...

3603
04:53:35,139 --> 04:53:35,860
I don't remember.

3604
04:53:35,860 --> 04:53:36,259
I forget.

3605
04:53:36,979 --> 04:53:39,479
I need to go on top.

3606
04:53:40,599 --> 04:53:57,099
Oh!

3607
04:53:58,060 --> 04:54:02,840
I told you I knew where the traps were.

3608
04:54:03,479 --> 04:54:24,759
All right.

3609
04:54:24,759 --> 04:54:25,240
Then it's up.

3610
04:54:25,799 --> 04:54:26,840
Watch out for the rat.

3611
04:54:26,840 --> 04:54:27,240
There's two.

3612
04:54:27,959 --> 04:54:28,889
I don't know where they are.

3613
04:54:29,450 --> 04:54:33,259
Now we're on...

3614
04:54:33,259 --> 04:54:34,380
This is the iron...

3615
04:54:34,380 --> 04:54:35,659
The iron giant's up here, right?

3616
04:54:48,520 --> 04:54:49,799
I gotta move my body for this.

3617
04:54:49,799 --> 04:54:50,680
I'm going too fast.

3618
04:54:50,680 --> 04:54:52,759
I can stand right there, I think, right?

3619
04:54:53,560 --> 04:54:54,360
Can I stand in the middle?

3620
04:54:55,080 --> 04:55:00,680
All right.

3621
04:55:00,680 --> 04:55:01,000
We're good.

3622
04:55:05,540 --> 04:55:05,939
There it is.

3623
04:55:20,650 --> 04:55:21,369
Now is...

3624
04:55:21,369 --> 04:55:22,889
There's no explosive throws.

3625
04:55:24,470 --> 04:55:25,349
That can't be possible.

3626
04:55:25,349 --> 04:55:25,590
No.

3627
04:55:25,590 --> 04:55:25,909
No way.

3628
04:55:29,770 --> 04:55:32,330
No rat is going to throw an explosive bomb over here.

3629
04:55:52,500 --> 04:55:54,759
Okay.

3630
04:55:54,759 --> 04:55:55,560
Just got to go up.

3631
04:55:56,279 --> 04:56:07,500
I'm almost there.

3632
04:56:07,500 --> 04:56:08,380
And then I can go to Gwyn.

3633
04:56:09,020 --> 04:56:16,459
Wait.

3634
04:56:16,459 --> 04:56:17,180
What about that ring?

3635
04:56:17,180 --> 04:56:17,659
Let me see it.

3636
04:56:18,299 --> 04:56:21,479
Reduces lava damage.

3637
04:56:26,900 --> 04:56:28,500
Crown of the Dark Sun.

3638
04:56:41,060 --> 04:56:41,380
Nice.

3639
04:56:42,180 --> 04:56:43,779
I'm the Angry Mario Sun.

3640
04:56:43,779 --> 04:56:44,020
Cool.

3641
04:56:45,220 --> 04:56:45,459
All right.

3642
04:56:45,459 --> 04:56:45,779
Let's go.

3643
04:57:01,020 --> 04:57:03,340
Now that was an epic gamer reference.

3644
04:57:03,340 --> 04:57:03,740
Thanks.

3645
04:57:08,569 --> 04:57:09,770
You can go up in those, can't you?

3646
04:57:10,330 --> 04:57:25,099
I remember this place was so ridiculous.

3647
04:57:25,099 --> 04:57:26,860
Thank god I can just walk around through it.

3648
04:58:05,290 --> 04:58:10,099
Leggings of Thorns, purging stone.

3649
04:58:10,099 --> 04:58:11,220
Humanity.

3650
04:58:11,220 --> 04:58:12,020
Hooray!

3651
04:58:12,020 --> 04:58:13,139
I did it.

3652
04:58:13,139 --> 04:58:14,099
Give it to me.

3653
04:58:14,099 --> 04:58:31,639
All right.

3654
04:58:31,639 --> 04:58:32,360
And a Londo.

3655
04:58:34,700 --> 04:58:35,900
How much more do I have?

3656
04:58:35,900 --> 04:58:38,549
To actually just jump right down to Gwyn.

3657
04:58:38,549 --> 04:58:39,930
I'm almost there, right?

3658
04:58:53,860 --> 04:58:56,099
Yeah, this is 50% of the way through the game.

3659
04:58:56,099 --> 04:58:56,979
You're right.

3660
04:58:58,220 --> 04:58:58,779
That's true.

3661
04:58:58,779 --> 04:58:59,580
You know, you're right.

3662
04:59:10,200 --> 04:59:12,840
You still are about 30 minutes to an hour to get to Gwyn.

3663
04:59:27,220 --> 04:59:29,619
Hey, well, at least, hey, I beat the good half of the game, right?

3664
04:59:29,619 --> 04:59:31,299
Yeah, that was fun.

3665
04:59:31,299 --> 04:59:36,630
I'm not, no, I'm not.

3666
04:59:36,630 --> 04:59:54,759
That's the only fire keeper I have left.

3667
04:59:54,759 --> 04:59:55,880
Didn't beat Bed of Chaos.

3668
04:59:55,880 --> 04:59:56,680
I know I'm missing stuff.

3669
04:59:56,680 --> 05:00:02,680
I'm just trying to...

3670
05:00:02,680 --> 05:00:05,000
Oh yeah, still have to beat like Ornstein and Smog and...

3671
05:00:05,560 --> 05:00:14,580
Why is there a pinwheel here?

3672
05:00:14,580 --> 05:00:57,060
All right, can I turn it back to like random nonsense again?

3673
05:00:57,060 --> 05:00:59,380
I think this has lost its luster.

3674
05:00:59,380 --> 05:01:17,049
Do a pole?

3675
05:01:17,049 --> 05:01:17,610
Hold on.

3676
05:01:17,610 --> 05:01:22,169
After the next pinwheel, I'll do a pole.

3677
05:01:22,169 --> 05:01:23,290
I'll give it the eight minutes.

3678
05:01:23,930 --> 05:01:53,049
Because I truly failed at that point, right?

3679
05:01:53,049 --> 05:01:53,770
Perfect.

3680
05:01:53,770 --> 05:01:57,770
Why do they always perfectly do this?

3681
05:01:57,770 --> 05:01:59,130
Even a rat will do it.

3682
05:01:59,130 --> 05:02:02,540
So that's surprising to me somehow.

3683
05:02:02,540 --> 05:02:06,220
Watch the Lord Vessel be in the rafter.

3684
05:02:06,779 --> 05:02:19,319
Holy shit, that almost didn't make it.

3685
05:02:19,319 --> 05:02:36,020
Then I got to turn this.

3686
05:02:39,509 --> 05:02:47,880
We spin all the way around, which leads me over here.

3687
05:02:49,880 --> 05:02:50,919
To which is the...

3688
05:02:50,919 --> 05:02:52,119
There's a front door, right?

3689
05:02:52,119 --> 05:02:52,599
Over here.

3690
05:03:01,560 --> 05:03:05,049
This makes 10 pinwheels, doesn't it?

3691
05:03:05,049 --> 05:03:06,650
I think this is 10 pinwheels.

3692
05:03:15,560 --> 05:03:16,759
Almost, that was close.

3693
05:03:17,240 --> 05:03:18,119
You almost had it.

3694
05:03:18,680 --> 05:03:28,439
What'd he drop?

3695
05:03:29,080 --> 05:03:39,779
I don't know.

3696
05:03:39,779 --> 05:03:43,060
Did you set these enemies yourself or did you get fucked by the seed?

3697
05:03:44,180 --> 05:03:46,740
That would be really funny if I didn't set this.

3698
05:03:46,740 --> 05:03:48,740
And it was actually just pinwheels and rats.

3699
05:03:51,450 --> 05:03:53,130
All right, executive decision.

3700
05:03:53,130 --> 05:03:55,290
At six minutes, I'm turning it back on to complete random.

3701
05:03:55,290 --> 05:03:57,049
And I'm going to try to get through at least this part again.

3702
05:04:00,500 --> 05:04:05,060
I mean, there's only so long that you can take an hour and a half of pinwheel and rats.

3703
05:04:07,779 --> 05:04:09,380
You know, there gets to be a point where...

3704
05:04:10,900 --> 05:04:13,669
You see what I'm saying?

3705
05:04:19,189 --> 05:04:20,389
How much more of that can you take?

3706
05:04:29,689 --> 05:04:30,650
Not very much, right?

3707
05:04:38,939 --> 05:04:40,939
This is actually a really hard part of the game.

3708
05:04:41,580 --> 05:04:47,479
It is made completely negligible from rats running off the cliff.

3709
05:04:47,479 --> 05:04:49,560
This is where the big bow and arrow guys are.

3710
05:04:49,560 --> 05:04:50,680
This is awful.

3711
05:04:50,680 --> 05:04:52,040
This spot in particular sucks.

3712
05:05:03,080 --> 05:05:16,470
Where's the bonfire?

3713
05:05:16,470 --> 05:05:17,270
Isn't it in here somewhere?

3714
05:05:22,060 --> 05:05:24,060
I don't even need a bonfire where I'm going.

3715
05:05:24,779 --> 05:05:27,270
Where's Ornstein?

3716
05:05:27,270 --> 05:05:28,310
I'm close to Ornstein.

3717
05:05:28,869 --> 05:05:33,209
I don't need a bonfire where I'm going.

3718
05:05:33,770 --> 05:05:34,810
That's gonna be fine.

3719
05:05:34,810 --> 05:05:35,529
It's just rats.

3720
05:05:36,169 --> 05:05:41,580
I thought that was an enemy and I was like, why is that here?

3721
05:05:41,580 --> 05:05:41,979
Shouldn't be.

3722
05:05:44,380 --> 05:05:44,939
Four minutes.

3723
05:05:45,500 --> 05:05:59,430
This will be the final thing that I do until we do absolute hell mode again

3724
05:05:59,430 --> 05:06:00,549
and I'll try to get through something.

3725
05:06:01,189 --> 05:06:04,659
I have to be pinwheel and pinwheel.

3726
05:06:05,380 --> 05:06:15,110
How do you pronounce Einstein?

3727
05:06:15,669 --> 05:06:17,130
Einstein.

3728
05:06:17,689 --> 05:06:34,340
I don't need bonfires where I'm going.

3729
05:06:34,340 --> 05:06:34,979
Don't worry guys.

3730
05:06:35,779 --> 05:06:48,169
Oh yeah, I can jump off this.

3731
05:06:48,169 --> 05:06:50,169
Here we go.

3732
05:06:50,169 --> 05:06:55,939
Here we go.

3733
05:06:56,580 --> 05:07:14,709
This doesn't do anything, right?

3734
05:07:16,060 --> 05:07:23,909
Wait, will it be...

3735
05:07:23,909 --> 05:07:25,830
Is it gonna be NPCs?

3736
05:07:26,630 --> 05:07:33,799
I don't got time for this shit.

3737
05:07:33,799 --> 05:07:34,680
It's just gonna be normal.

3738
05:07:34,680 --> 05:07:36,040
No, you've already seen that before.

3739
05:07:36,040 --> 05:07:38,549
Who cares?

3740
05:07:38,549 --> 05:07:48,150
You want me to use the orb or do you want to see two pinwheels?

3741
05:07:48,150 --> 05:07:48,790
Both.

3742
05:07:48,790 --> 05:07:56,200
I'm gonna die to this person.

3743
05:07:56,200 --> 05:07:57,319
I can't even use this.

3744
05:07:57,319 --> 05:08:14,939
It's gonna be three pinwheels.

3745
05:08:15,500 --> 05:08:16,220
Oh no, it's not.

3746
05:08:57,000 --> 05:09:06,299
I got no stamina for this shit.

3747
05:09:07,020 --> 05:09:17,340
Bastard.

3748
05:09:28,340 --> 05:09:34,229
No!

3749
05:09:34,229 --> 05:09:35,669
That does so much fucking damage.

3750
05:09:58,360 --> 05:09:58,680
Whoa!

3751
05:10:00,200 --> 05:10:00,520
Hey!

3752
05:10:01,240 --> 05:10:01,959
What's going on?

3753
05:10:02,840 --> 05:10:04,040
What happened?

3754
05:10:04,040 --> 05:10:04,279
Hey!

3755
05:10:08,869 --> 05:10:09,669
What's happening?

3756
05:10:10,630 --> 05:10:11,669
It's so loud.

3757
05:10:12,389 --> 05:10:14,069
It's fucking up my concentration.

3758
05:10:16,709 --> 05:10:17,990
It's burning into my brain.

3759
05:10:18,549 --> 05:10:19,110
It hurts.

3760
05:10:22,200 --> 05:10:24,279
Take the popcorn out of the microwave.

3761
05:10:28,220 --> 05:10:29,259
Oh, it's the timer.

3762
05:10:29,259 --> 05:10:29,979
It's the timer.

3763
05:10:31,099 --> 05:10:37,619
The hard part's over.

3764
05:10:37,619 --> 05:10:38,259
Just get it done.

3765
05:10:47,959 --> 05:10:49,000
It's getting louder.

3766
05:10:49,560 --> 05:10:54,549
I think it's actually getting louder.

3767
05:10:59,189 --> 05:10:59,830
I miss it.

3768
05:10:59,830 --> 05:11:00,549
I like Monopack.

3769
05:11:01,430 --> 05:11:02,630
I kind of like want it back.

3770
05:11:02,630 --> 05:11:03,110
Where is it?

3771
05:11:03,669 --> 05:11:04,939
Oh, it's freaking me.

3772
05:11:04,939 --> 05:11:06,860
It's fucking messing with me even more.

3773
05:11:06,860 --> 05:11:16,520
Did I win?

3774
05:11:16,520 --> 05:11:29,750
I didn't even get his item.

3775
05:11:29,750 --> 05:11:31,270
That, I swear to God.

3776
05:11:31,270 --> 05:11:32,470
I thought, I, you know what?

3777
05:11:32,470 --> 05:11:33,909
Here's what I thought actually happened.

3778
05:11:35,080 --> 05:11:37,560
I thought there was an emergency on the computer.

3779
05:11:39,529 --> 05:11:43,130
Like somehow in Windows 10, there's an emergency signal

3780
05:11:43,130 --> 05:11:44,250
with something really bad.

3781
05:11:44,250 --> 05:11:47,450
Like you got a virus or your memory is bad

3782
05:11:47,450 --> 05:11:49,209
or your computer's gonna start to burn or something.

3783
05:11:49,209 --> 05:11:50,090
Like Intel has a thing.

3784
05:11:50,090 --> 05:11:52,250
Like your computer's burning.

3785
05:11:52,250 --> 05:11:53,529
I had no idea what that was.

3786
05:11:54,169 --> 05:12:05,580
Here they go.

3787
05:12:13,580 --> 05:12:18,250
I love the little teeth intestines thing.

3788
05:12:23,930 --> 05:12:25,290
Pinwheel and pinstein.

3789
05:12:26,090 --> 05:12:49,049
Wait, what happens when you kill one of them?

3790
05:12:49,049 --> 05:12:50,810
Do they turn into a super pinwheel?

3791
05:13:13,290 --> 05:13:16,009
Oh, look at this.

3792
05:13:16,009 --> 05:13:29,990
I think he just got bigger.

3793
05:13:51,930 --> 05:13:53,639
That was a lot easier.

3794
05:13:54,840 --> 05:13:55,799
Which way did he go?

3795
05:13:58,459 --> 05:14:00,860
I swear he was just standing right in front of me.

3796
05:14:02,009 --> 05:14:02,409
Weird.

3797
05:14:03,049 --> 05:14:24,779
Here comes the Lord Vessel.

3798
05:14:24,860 --> 05:14:27,340
Now I go talk to the weird snake thing in the ground

3799
05:14:27,340 --> 05:14:28,459
and I say yes.

3800
05:14:28,459 --> 05:14:37,900
And we're going back to fully random.

3801
05:14:37,900 --> 05:14:39,020
I did my pinwheel.

3802
05:14:40,259 --> 05:14:41,380
I did my pinwheel.

3803
05:14:41,380 --> 05:15:22,150
Penance, give me the Lord Vessel.

3804
05:15:22,150 --> 05:15:25,619
Thank you.

3805
05:15:25,619 --> 05:15:29,220
Go get the Lord Vessel and then come back to see me.

3806
05:15:29,860 --> 05:15:34,500
Bring the Lord Vessel back and claim Gwyn as the rightful.

3807
05:15:35,220 --> 05:15:39,110
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

3808
05:15:39,110 --> 05:15:43,619
Oh, by the way, eat shit.

3809
05:16:05,689 --> 05:16:07,930
I will transform into pinwheel.

3810
05:16:19,500 --> 05:16:20,220
Whatever.

3811
05:16:20,220 --> 05:16:29,689
Let's go to...

3812
05:16:29,689 --> 05:16:30,729
Where do I want to go now?

3813
05:16:30,729 --> 05:16:31,610
Quickly, quickly, tell me.

3814
05:16:31,610 --> 05:16:32,090
Where do I go?

3815
05:16:32,090 --> 05:16:37,610
I go to Firelink, talk to the snake.

3816
05:16:37,610 --> 05:16:39,209
And then we're going to do all random.

3817
05:16:44,060 --> 05:16:46,060
Oh, yes, you found the Lord Vessel.

3818
05:16:46,939 --> 05:16:49,740
Give it here, you fucking wanker.

3819
05:16:50,299 --> 05:17:07,130
All right, fastest way for me to do this.

3820
05:17:08,220 --> 05:17:10,220
What's the fastest way to get to Gwyn?

3821
05:17:19,500 --> 05:17:20,459
Say yes or say no.

3822
05:17:33,689 --> 05:17:35,369
Did you kill a bunch of people going down here?

3823
05:17:37,930 --> 05:17:38,810
Who are you killing?

3824
05:17:38,810 --> 05:17:39,689
People are just dying.

3825
05:17:46,599 --> 05:17:48,759
Sif, Four Kings, Pinwheel, Nito, Gwyn.

3826
05:17:48,759 --> 05:17:49,400
That's too long.

3827
05:17:50,520 --> 05:18:06,069
Killing the actual pinwheel is your real final fight.

3828
05:18:06,069 --> 05:18:08,470
But the thing is, pinwheel is not going to be pinwheel.

3829
05:18:09,189 --> 05:18:11,349
Pinwheel is going to get replaced by a different boss.

3830
05:18:12,389 --> 05:18:16,389
See, that's the big kicker here.

3831
05:18:33,060 --> 05:18:33,939
All right, here we go.

3832
05:18:34,979 --> 05:18:36,020
The timer's still on the screen?

3833
05:18:36,020 --> 05:18:36,979
Yeah, I'll do it.

3834
05:18:38,500 --> 05:18:40,779
Let's warp to...

3835
05:18:42,540 --> 05:18:43,500
Where the hell do I need to go?

3836
05:18:43,500 --> 05:18:44,540
First of all, let me do random.

3837
05:18:45,500 --> 05:18:47,700
This is all saved, we're good.

3838
05:18:51,459 --> 05:18:53,060
All right, here comes the shit show.

3839
05:18:53,860 --> 05:18:55,700
And we're probably going to end on this note here.

3840
05:18:56,580 --> 05:18:59,450
I'm actually surprised we've been doing this for five and a half hours almost.

3841
05:18:59,450 --> 05:19:06,520
So let's do one more rowdy randomize.

3842
05:19:07,159 --> 05:19:12,759
Replace bosses with bosses.

3843
05:19:13,400 --> 05:19:18,220
Replace normal enemies with bosses or normal enemies.

3844
05:19:21,080 --> 05:19:22,680
Replace NPCs.

3845
05:19:22,680 --> 05:19:28,220
Replacement chance for a boss to be a random enemy will be 20%.

3846
05:19:30,380 --> 05:19:31,259
All bosses.

3847
05:19:31,740 --> 05:19:40,650
So replace bosses with bosses and replace normal enemies with bosses.

3848
05:19:41,369 --> 05:19:43,750
Am I doing...

3849
05:19:48,150 --> 05:19:49,909
We already did that and it was too much.

3850
05:19:50,470 --> 05:19:54,860
No, replace bosses with bosses.

3851
05:19:54,860 --> 05:19:57,900
Replace normal enemies with normal enemies or bosses.

3852
05:19:59,240 --> 05:20:03,720
And there is a 10% chance that a normal enemy will be a boss.

3853
05:20:04,279 --> 05:20:07,400
Don't replace NPCs.

3854
05:20:07,400 --> 05:20:09,799
It's fully random, you can put them anywhere, 10%.

3855
05:20:10,680 --> 05:20:19,750
Let's open up the config and enable everybody.

3856
05:20:19,750 --> 05:20:21,930
Okay, that sounds good to me.

3857
05:20:22,569 --> 05:20:24,470
Am I feeling lucky?

3858
05:20:24,470 --> 05:20:25,110
We'll find out.

3859
05:20:31,430 --> 05:20:33,270
This is the best night to be high.

3860
05:20:37,459 --> 05:20:40,419
Oh, by the way, I'm not going to be live tomorrow because of 4th of July.

3861
05:20:41,139 --> 05:20:44,229
Kim and I are going to go see some fireworks.

3862
05:20:44,869 --> 05:20:48,889
So you'll probably see me again on either Friday or Saturday.

3863
05:20:50,009 --> 05:20:51,930
I might have some stuff that I want to do for the carnival.

3864
05:20:52,729 --> 05:20:53,930
So depending on...

3865
05:20:53,930 --> 05:20:55,290
Just keep an eye on the sus.

3866
05:20:55,290 --> 05:20:56,569
Friday or Saturday you'll see me again.

3867
05:20:57,209 --> 05:21:02,759
Should be fun.

3868
05:21:04,790 --> 05:21:05,669
And I'm ready to start.

3869
05:21:05,669 --> 05:21:05,990
Let's go.

3870
05:21:09,450 --> 05:21:21,590
Speaking of getting high, I won't be broadcasting tomorrow.

3871
05:21:21,590 --> 05:21:22,950
Oh, really makes you think.

3872
05:21:22,950 --> 05:21:23,189
No.

3873
05:21:24,900 --> 05:21:25,139
No.

3874
05:21:30,970 --> 05:21:31,770
All right, let's go.

3875
05:21:32,790 --> 05:21:33,669
I need to go to...

3876
05:21:36,439 --> 05:21:37,639
Uh, what?

3877
05:21:37,639 --> 05:21:38,520
Firelink?

3878
05:21:38,520 --> 05:21:40,040
Or what's closest to...

3879
05:21:41,159 --> 05:21:42,840
I have to go down in like the depths or something.

3880
05:21:42,840 --> 05:21:44,279
Catacombs or something, right?

3881
05:21:44,279 --> 05:21:52,659
If I remember correctly, I just have to walk down from Firelink.

3882
05:21:53,459 --> 05:21:58,810
Go revive the Firekeeper.

3883
05:22:02,180 --> 05:22:02,979
What's dying?

3884
05:22:02,979 --> 05:22:03,619
I don't know.

3885
05:22:03,619 --> 05:22:04,500
Something above us?

3886
05:22:05,299 --> 05:22:07,930
Oh, the timer overlay, right.

3887
05:22:18,069 --> 05:22:18,709
10%?

3888
05:22:20,409 --> 05:22:21,450
10% chance.

3889
05:22:22,009 --> 05:22:24,389
Oh, are you sure it's on 10%?

3890
05:22:25,029 --> 05:22:31,450
Because I swear it is.

3891
05:22:32,090 --> 05:22:41,130
It's not on 100.

3892
05:22:41,130 --> 05:22:41,849
I saved it.

3893
05:22:41,849 --> 05:22:42,810
I made sure it wasn't.

3894
05:22:52,819 --> 05:22:53,299
You're back.

3895
05:22:53,299 --> 05:22:53,860
Everything's fine.

3896
05:22:53,860 --> 05:22:54,340
You're alive.

3897
05:22:55,060 --> 05:23:05,959
Is it still not lit?

3898
05:23:12,900 --> 05:23:14,180
I have to light this thing.

3899
05:23:14,900 --> 05:23:17,139
I'm not going to go like this.

3900
05:23:17,139 --> 05:23:18,099
But now you stand up.

3901
05:23:21,659 --> 05:23:22,860
Well, maybe I...

3902
05:23:30,009 --> 05:23:30,970
You ran out of time.

3903
05:23:30,970 --> 05:23:31,450
You lose.

3904
05:23:31,450 --> 05:23:33,369
All right, let me get this off the screen.

3905
05:23:33,369 --> 05:23:34,090
That would be nice.

3906
05:23:35,209 --> 05:23:44,759
Let's go to Firelink.

3907
05:23:53,419 --> 05:23:55,259
Now I need to go from Firelink.

3908
05:23:55,819 --> 05:23:56,380
No, don't...

3909
05:23:56,380 --> 05:23:56,779
I don't...

3910
05:23:56,779 --> 05:23:57,580
Everything's already lit.

3911
05:23:57,580 --> 05:23:58,060
It's fine.

3912
05:23:58,060 --> 05:23:58,619
Okay, we're good.

3913
05:23:59,500 --> 05:24:00,939
So now I need to level up.

3914
05:24:01,740 --> 05:24:02,459
I don't have enough.

3915
05:24:03,419 --> 05:24:09,049
Here come all the enemies up there.

3916
05:24:13,700 --> 05:24:15,380
So you're just hanging out here sleeping.

3917
05:24:19,000 --> 05:24:23,560
Now I need to go down from here to the graveyard, right?

3918
05:24:24,279 --> 05:24:29,209
This is the fastest way to the graveyard.

3919
05:24:30,569 --> 05:24:36,150
I always have trouble getting to the graveyard

3920
05:24:36,150 --> 05:24:37,270
by simply walking to it.

3921
05:24:37,830 --> 05:24:41,369
It's like down that way, right?

3922
05:24:47,000 --> 05:24:56,090
Isn't it like down here?

3923
05:24:57,909 --> 05:25:00,150
Where is that dumb walkway to the graveyard?

3924
05:25:01,509 --> 05:25:02,470
It's not this way.

3925
05:25:03,029 --> 05:25:04,540
Help me, help me, help me, help me.

3926
05:25:04,540 --> 05:25:05,099
Somebody help me.

3927
05:25:05,099 --> 05:25:05,740
Help me.

3928
05:25:05,740 --> 05:25:06,540
Help me.

3929
05:25:06,540 --> 05:25:07,099
I need help.

3930
05:25:07,819 --> 05:25:19,080
Wait, it's an emote-only mode.

3931
05:25:19,080 --> 05:25:19,580
Fuck.

3932
05:25:20,279 --> 05:25:23,189
What are you guys doing?

3933
05:25:25,180 --> 05:25:26,459
Why is it an emote-only mode?

3934
05:25:26,459 --> 05:25:45,189
What's going on over here?

3935
05:25:45,189 --> 05:25:46,470
Left of the snake man.

3936
05:25:46,470 --> 05:25:47,990
All right, I'm going to go left of the snake man.

3937
05:26:05,080 --> 05:26:05,479
Thank you.

3938
05:26:13,700 --> 05:26:17,290
10 percent.

3939
05:26:17,290 --> 05:26:18,650
How is this 10 percent?

3940
05:26:18,650 --> 05:26:19,770
It's like 60.

3941
05:26:23,750 --> 05:26:25,029
I don't- I've never-

3942
05:26:25,029 --> 05:26:26,310
I don't think I've seen-

3943
05:26:26,310 --> 05:26:27,509
Did I actually get cursed?

3944
05:26:27,509 --> 05:26:31,189
Oh yeah, because these stupid things curse you.

3945
05:26:31,189 --> 05:26:33,750
I've never even seen that boss before.

3946
05:26:38,419 --> 05:26:39,139
Oh, and I'm-

3947
05:26:39,139 --> 05:26:40,740
My HP is cut in half.

3948
05:26:42,009 --> 05:26:42,650
Great.

3949
05:26:42,650 --> 05:26:45,270
Good thing I have that-

3950
05:26:47,349 --> 05:26:48,709
Good thing I have the purging stone.

3951
05:26:49,270 --> 05:26:50,869
I'm not using it yet till I get through this.

3952
05:26:51,509 --> 05:27:00,819
I wanted the item.

3953
05:27:13,060 --> 05:27:13,560
Shit.

3954
05:27:16,220 --> 05:27:17,020
I gotta just run.

3955
05:27:17,979 --> 05:27:20,200
That wake up was-

3956
05:27:21,400 --> 05:27:23,240
May as well have been street fighter.

3957
05:27:23,799 --> 05:27:24,299
What?

3958
05:27:25,000 --> 05:27:31,610
Why does he have a big purple rock?

3959
05:27:34,819 --> 05:27:36,419
He has a crunch berry.

3960
05:27:46,020 --> 05:27:47,299
That was boo berry.

3961
05:27:47,299 --> 05:27:48,500
That wasn't even an enemy.

3962
05:27:49,220 --> 05:27:58,299
What a shithole.

3963
05:27:58,860 --> 05:27:59,659
Oh my god.

3964
05:28:00,299 --> 05:28:04,409
This is just a shit show.

3965
05:28:05,290 --> 05:28:07,659
Thankfully Sip is not running over here too.

3966
05:28:15,110 --> 05:28:17,189
Is it 10 percent for normal enemies?

3967
05:28:17,189 --> 05:28:19,110
I really would not be surprised

3968
05:28:19,110 --> 05:28:19,909
if that were the case.

3969
05:28:28,490 --> 05:28:29,689
I deserve to die for that one.

3970
05:28:30,250 --> 05:28:36,150
Dude, it really might be 10 percent for normal-

3971
05:28:36,150 --> 05:28:37,909
There's another big fucking enemy over here.

3972
05:28:41,700 --> 05:28:44,419
There's another centipede down here.

3973
05:28:52,380 --> 05:28:52,939
Let me look at it.

3974
05:28:52,939 --> 05:28:53,500
What does it say?

3975
05:28:54,220 --> 05:28:58,919
Percent boss chance.

3976
05:28:58,919 --> 05:29:00,759
Chance that a normal enemy or NPC

3977
05:29:00,759 --> 05:29:02,200
will be replaced with a boss

3978
05:29:02,200 --> 05:29:03,639
instead of a normal enemy.

3979
05:29:03,639 --> 05:29:05,319
10 percent.

3980
05:29:05,959 --> 05:29:11,430
It's 10-

3981
05:29:11,430 --> 05:29:12,709
It's on 10 percent.

3982
05:29:12,709 --> 05:29:32,919
Percentages don't work like a one in 10.

3983
05:29:35,240 --> 05:29:36,279
That's 10 percent.

3984
05:29:37,080 --> 05:29:39,080
That means 10 percent per enemy.

3985
05:29:39,080 --> 05:29:41,560
So one in 10 chance for every enemy to be a boss.

3986
05:29:43,700 --> 05:29:46,020
Yeah, but that's still a nine out of 10 chance.

3987
05:29:46,020 --> 05:29:46,900
It has to roll that.

3988
05:29:46,900 --> 05:29:48,020
You still have to roll a one.

3989
05:29:54,200 --> 05:29:55,080
You know, in that scenario

3990
05:29:55,080 --> 05:29:56,520
you still got to roll a one.

3991
05:29:56,520 --> 05:29:58,040
I don't know why I keep going down

3992
05:29:58,759 --> 05:29:59,560
the stairs over there.

3993
05:30:03,860 --> 05:30:05,540
If you open random number generator right now

3994
05:30:05,540 --> 05:30:08,740
you probably get six, two, two, eight, nine,

3995
05:30:08,740 --> 05:30:12,740
two, six, six, six, four, three, three, three, six, eight, two, two, one.

3996
05:30:13,619 --> 05:30:31,400
I don't think I'm even gonna be able to walk through this door.

3997
05:30:35,669 --> 05:30:36,889
What an ass.

3998
05:30:46,119 --> 05:30:47,159
Oh no, an ass?

3999
05:30:54,299 --> 05:30:54,939
All right.

4000
05:30:54,939 --> 05:30:55,900
Perching stone time.

4001
05:30:58,580 --> 05:31:11,560
Do you see anything down there?

4002
05:31:13,259 --> 05:31:14,220
I do not see a boss.

4003
05:31:22,740 --> 05:31:28,040
I love how the dog T-pose is just a fancy weird rug.

4004
05:31:28,599 --> 05:31:35,610
It's one of those like stupid like rugs on the ground.

4005
05:31:35,610 --> 05:31:46,250
Just rolled into that.

4006
05:31:46,810 --> 05:31:50,790
Okay, is it bonfire?

4007
05:31:50,790 --> 05:31:59,619
I'm rolling it again.

4008
05:31:59,619 --> 05:32:04,549
I'm putting it down to five percent.

4009
05:32:05,110 --> 05:32:13,849
I just rolled it.

4010
05:32:13,849 --> 05:32:15,529
I ain't having the centipede down there.

4011
05:32:28,700 --> 05:32:29,419
OBS crash?

4012
05:32:29,419 --> 05:32:30,380
No, OBS is fine.

4013
05:32:30,380 --> 05:32:32,139
Reach it up.

4014
05:32:32,139 --> 05:32:33,419
Well, you want to reroll the items too.

4015
05:32:33,419 --> 05:32:34,540
I mean, we're at the end.

4016
05:32:34,540 --> 05:32:39,580
Why don't we just reroll items?

4017
05:32:39,580 --> 05:32:46,700
Just who cares?

4018
05:32:46,700 --> 05:32:47,259
Yeah, fuck it.

4019
05:32:47,259 --> 05:32:47,740
Let's do it.

4020
05:32:49,189 --> 05:32:59,900
All right, here it comes.

4021
05:32:59,900 --> 05:33:03,669
Let's reroll the items again.

4022
05:33:03,669 --> 05:33:11,939
So let's do just scrambled.

4023
05:33:11,939 --> 05:33:12,900
Scrambling the items.

4024
05:33:17,419 --> 05:33:19,580
Success.

4025
05:33:19,580 --> 05:33:21,860
Items have been scrambled.

4026
05:33:21,860 --> 05:33:23,139
So have the enemies.

4027
05:33:23,139 --> 05:33:27,900
Do I like my eggs scrambled?

4028
05:33:27,900 --> 05:33:28,779
Yes, I do.

4029
05:33:28,779 --> 05:33:33,000
I like them over easy, over medium.

4030
05:33:33,560 --> 05:33:37,770
Semi-side up to me is disgusting.

4031
05:33:40,939 --> 05:33:42,939
No, would not like to eat that.

4032
05:33:49,990 --> 05:33:52,520
Is there a bear in here?

4033
05:33:52,520 --> 05:33:53,689
Oh, it's a cat.

4034
05:33:55,500 --> 05:33:56,459
Did my items?

4035
05:33:56,459 --> 05:33:58,779
The items on me didn't scramble.

4036
05:33:58,779 --> 05:34:11,319
Where the hell does it think I am?

4037
05:34:14,340 --> 05:34:14,900
Oh, okay.

4038
05:34:14,900 --> 05:34:16,020
No, this is where I was.

4039
05:34:23,000 --> 05:34:43,880
What's the tree?

4040
05:34:44,439 --> 05:34:51,860
Is that a piece of broccoli?

4041
05:34:53,509 --> 05:34:55,029
Wait.

4042
05:34:55,029 --> 05:34:58,069
Oh, all the items have been respawned and replaced.

4043
05:35:04,549 --> 05:35:05,029
Interesting.

4044
05:35:05,590 --> 05:35:13,959
Okay.

4045
05:35:13,959 --> 05:35:14,759
I want to see what it is.

4046
05:35:15,740 --> 05:35:20,520
I just want to see what the tree is, man.

4047
05:35:21,400 --> 05:35:24,599
I just want to see what the broccoli thing is.

4048
05:35:26,040 --> 05:35:29,180
Okay, somebody explain this to me.

4049
05:35:29,819 --> 05:35:37,700
Do you know that inside of a clamshell package,

4050
05:35:37,700 --> 05:35:41,459
a plastic packaging smell, like brand new plastic packaging.

4051
05:35:42,259 --> 05:35:45,159
Why am I smelling that right now?

4052
05:35:45,720 --> 05:35:46,360
What does that mean?

4053
05:35:47,560 --> 05:36:08,040
My room right now smells like synthetic plastic.

4054
05:36:08,040 --> 05:36:12,099
Synthetic plastic for no reason.

4055
05:36:22,340 --> 05:36:22,900
As opposed to...

4056
05:36:22,900 --> 05:36:23,220
No, no, no.

4057
05:36:23,220 --> 05:36:26,020
It's a very distinct plastic smell.

4058
05:36:26,580 --> 05:36:27,860
Just give it to the broccoli, please.

4059
05:36:31,669 --> 05:36:33,029
No, not like plastic burning.

4060
05:36:33,029 --> 05:36:35,189
Just plastic like inside of a plastic bag.

4061
05:36:36,069 --> 05:36:39,270
I need to kill the broccoli before I die.

4062
05:36:39,270 --> 05:36:39,990
Thank God.

4063
05:36:51,419 --> 05:36:52,459
Bag on head.

4064
05:36:53,099 --> 05:36:53,740
What's happening?

4065
05:36:53,740 --> 05:36:54,619
There's a bag on me.

4066
05:36:55,659 --> 05:37:01,130
What the fuck is that smell?

4067
05:37:01,130 --> 05:37:02,569
It's freaking me out.

4068
05:37:02,569 --> 05:37:03,209
All right, hold on.

4069
05:37:03,209 --> 05:37:07,340
I'm gonna need to go see why the house smells like

4070
05:37:07,979 --> 05:37:11,020
the inside of a clamshell synthetic packaging.

4071
05:37:11,819 --> 05:37:13,770
All right, hold on.

4072
05:37:13,770 --> 05:37:14,330
Give me a second.

4073
05:37:14,330 --> 05:37:15,770
What the fuck is going on?

4074
05:37:16,409 --> 05:38:58,500
I'm not crazy.

4075
05:38:58,500 --> 05:39:04,549
So Kim is cleaning the oven all the way up here.

4076
05:39:04,549 --> 05:39:05,270
I knew it was happening.

4077
05:39:06,069 --> 05:39:11,450
Yeah, I'm telling you.

4078
05:39:12,330 --> 05:39:14,819
Am I putting you guys to sleep?

4079
05:39:16,659 --> 05:39:17,380
Sorry about that.

4080
05:39:17,380 --> 05:39:19,540
All right, let's wrap this up.

4081
05:39:19,540 --> 05:39:20,900
I need to kill the real pinwheel

4082
05:39:22,150 --> 05:39:23,990
and then stream some propaganda.

4083
05:39:36,330 --> 05:39:39,849
I'm determined to go get whatever is in pinwheel's place.

4084
05:39:40,490 --> 05:39:41,880
It has to die.

4085
05:39:45,220 --> 05:39:46,500
Not terrible spawn here.

4086
05:39:47,220 --> 05:39:51,619
Remember, all the items have been replaced again.

4087
05:39:51,619 --> 05:39:52,500
They've all been rolled again.

4088
05:39:54,919 --> 05:39:55,799
Not worth it.

4089
05:39:55,799 --> 05:40:02,659
You don't want to eat something coming up.

4090
05:40:02,659 --> 05:40:04,340
No, so what happens is when you clean an oven,

4091
05:40:04,340 --> 05:40:05,700
you have to make it really, really hot.

4092
05:40:06,659 --> 05:40:11,909
And from there, it's just kind of hot.

4093
05:40:11,909 --> 05:40:12,549
What is that?

4094
05:40:24,299 --> 05:40:25,659
Use the parry dagger.

4095
05:40:25,659 --> 05:40:31,610
No, it's a DLC boss.

4096
05:40:32,490 --> 05:40:34,650
I did all the Dark Souls DLC, didn't I?

4097
05:40:34,650 --> 05:40:35,849
I don't remember seeing that.

4098
05:40:36,409 --> 05:40:37,819
I didn't skip anything.

4099
05:40:45,529 --> 05:40:48,409
I know, I remember the Kameera thing.

4100
05:40:49,209 --> 05:40:51,290
I never remember it looking like that.

4101
05:40:51,290 --> 05:40:54,970
I thought it was orange and like tan, not white.

4102
05:40:55,930 --> 05:41:04,470
No, that's just him.

4103
05:41:05,029 --> 05:41:06,150
Remember I did both of them?

4104
05:41:07,189 --> 05:41:09,419
I did, yeah.

4105
05:41:10,220 --> 05:41:11,580
Remember I did the thing where you don't have to do it

4106
05:41:11,580 --> 05:41:12,299
and I killed them both?

4107
05:41:16,470 --> 05:41:18,790
Hey, you know I did the thing where I started talking

4108
05:41:18,790 --> 05:41:19,669
and walking in a circle?

4109
05:41:20,549 --> 05:41:22,069
You know how I do that, right?

4110
05:41:22,069 --> 05:41:22,470
LOL.

4111
05:41:23,430 --> 05:41:58,599
Yeah, when I get to this, this has got to end.

4112
05:42:00,630 --> 05:42:06,979
This is like, I think this is what it feels like

4113
05:42:06,979 --> 05:42:08,340
when somebody screams in your face

4114
05:42:08,340 --> 05:42:10,340
for more than like five to 10 straight minutes.

4115
05:42:11,060 --> 05:42:12,889
This is definitely what it feels like.

4116
05:42:13,610 --> 05:42:31,799
You'd feel all fucked up,

4117
05:42:31,799 --> 05:42:34,139
but it would be things would seem off.

4118
05:42:35,020 --> 05:42:36,700
Your room would start to smell like plastic.

4119
05:42:37,340 --> 05:42:55,900
Okay, I'm so close.

4120
05:42:56,919 --> 05:42:59,639
This time, just fall and run.

4121
05:43:00,599 --> 05:43:10,540
No, you're too big.

4122
05:43:10,540 --> 05:43:11,419
He's too big.

4123
05:43:12,220 --> 05:43:18,919
And then there's the little dinosaur things down here.

4124
05:43:18,919 --> 05:43:20,200
There's a guy down here.

4125
05:43:23,369 --> 05:43:24,970
What did I get caught on?

4126
05:43:25,770 --> 05:43:35,159
I have to kill this fucking thing, don't I?

4127
05:43:35,799 --> 05:43:53,900
You can do the same fucking move like five times.

4128
05:43:55,720 --> 05:43:56,599
I hate this game.

4129
05:44:06,169 --> 05:44:07,930
He's not even supposed to be down here.

4130
05:44:07,930 --> 05:44:08,889
I have to kill this.

4131
05:44:17,270 --> 05:44:21,580
Let me fight a blue dragon in as much room

4132
05:44:21,580 --> 05:44:24,459
as it takes to fit a blue dragon.

4133
05:44:24,459 --> 05:44:25,979
It's fucking great.

4134
05:44:58,439 --> 05:45:00,119
There's all kinds of zany characters here.

4135
05:45:00,119 --> 05:45:01,400
Everything is so zany.

4136
05:45:02,599 --> 05:45:11,000
Is he still trying to beat the game?

4137
05:45:11,000 --> 05:45:14,819
No, I'm just trying to get to Pinwheel

4138
05:45:14,819 --> 05:45:16,340
who is not even real Pinwheel.

4139
05:45:17,560 --> 05:45:19,319
But there's a different problem here.

4140
05:45:19,319 --> 05:45:24,680
There is a blue dragon who is now blocking my path.

4141
05:45:24,680 --> 05:45:26,040
I'm probably gonna have to aggro up here.

4142
05:45:27,000 --> 05:45:38,150
I didn't even know you could do that.

4143
05:45:46,279 --> 05:45:47,319
Actually, stay there

4144
05:45:47,319 --> 05:45:48,759
because you'll block anything that comes in.

4145
05:46:08,700 --> 05:46:10,220
He can't fit through there now either.

4146
05:46:11,610 --> 05:46:12,490
Oh my God.

4147
05:46:24,180 --> 05:46:24,979
Don't block me.

4148
05:46:26,650 --> 05:46:27,369
Come on.

4149
05:46:33,750 --> 05:46:36,470
I have to bait the electricity and then...

4150
05:46:37,349 --> 05:46:38,549
What just came down here?

4151
05:46:40,020 --> 05:46:41,459
What just sprinted down here?

4152
05:46:42,020 --> 05:46:42,819
The cat.

4153
05:46:48,200 --> 05:46:49,080
I'm gonna reroll it.

4154
05:46:49,639 --> 05:46:53,299
You can't fight that thing down there.

4155
05:46:53,299 --> 05:46:54,819
You can't fight that fucking thing in that room.

4156
05:46:56,650 --> 05:46:57,610
I gotta reroll that thing.

4157
05:47:08,680 --> 05:47:09,319
Pull the switch.

4158
05:47:11,299 --> 05:47:13,299
I want the bonfire so I don't have to keep...

4159
05:47:13,299 --> 05:47:15,139
But even if I get the bonfire,

4160
05:47:15,779 --> 05:47:18,259
I'm going to be at that bonfire

4161
05:47:18,259 --> 05:47:20,500
and a blue dragon will be behind me every single time.

4162
05:47:37,930 --> 05:47:38,810
I'm just rushing.

4163
05:47:39,529 --> 05:47:41,340
Fucking randomizing, man.

4164
05:47:42,139 --> 05:47:46,580
We're getting close to throwing up.

4165
05:48:01,450 --> 05:48:03,130
I would just walk straight, but watch.

4166
05:48:03,770 --> 05:48:09,049
I have to deal with all this bullshit.

4167
05:48:17,880 --> 05:48:19,240
It's safer to almost die.

4168
05:48:20,360 --> 05:48:21,639
All right, I'm gonna go pull the switch

4169
05:48:22,200 --> 05:48:24,090
and I'm gonna run the hell out of there.

4170
05:48:24,090 --> 05:48:38,580
This double blue dragon shit is like seriously...

4171
05:48:39,380 --> 05:48:40,659
How many enemies are in this game?

4172
05:48:40,659 --> 05:48:41,700
Like 600.

4173
05:48:42,659 --> 05:48:44,419
And I get just blue dragons.

4174
05:48:45,220 --> 05:48:57,110
I'm going for the pole and then I'm out.

4175
05:48:57,909 --> 05:49:01,340
Okay, give me stamina.

4176
05:49:01,340 --> 05:49:01,740
Here we go.

4177
05:49:02,459 --> 05:49:19,319
Please move.

4178
05:49:19,319 --> 05:49:38,310
There's another blue dragon, I swear.

4179
05:49:39,029 --> 05:49:45,270
All right, what do we got?

4180
05:49:45,270 --> 05:49:46,790
What do we got, what do we got, what do we got?

4181
05:49:46,790 --> 05:49:49,259
We have nothing that...

4182
05:49:49,259 --> 05:49:50,380
Is this thing gonna activate?

4183
05:49:51,099 --> 05:49:52,220
Is it gonna activate, isn't it?

4184
05:49:53,799 --> 05:49:54,680
It's not gonna activate, right?

4185
05:49:55,240 --> 05:50:05,959
Can I just...

4186
05:50:05,959 --> 05:50:06,919
No, it's a...

4187
05:50:06,919 --> 05:50:12,060
Shit.

4188
05:50:12,060 --> 05:50:19,580
Where are you shooting me from?

4189
05:50:19,580 --> 05:50:21,419
What's this line of sight you got here?

4190
05:50:22,299 --> 05:50:35,959
Oh, God.

4191
05:50:46,520 --> 05:50:48,040
Just go, just run around them.

4192
05:50:50,380 --> 05:50:51,020
Don't activate.

4193
05:50:53,939 --> 05:50:56,099
As long as these pigs don't activate, I'll be fine.

4194
05:50:56,659 --> 05:51:09,880
Why am I not hurting this?

4195
05:51:30,439 --> 05:51:31,720
Fully armored pig.

4196
05:51:31,720 --> 05:51:34,659
All right, so far so good.

4197
05:51:50,250 --> 05:51:51,130
Oh, God.

4198
05:51:51,130 --> 05:51:51,610
Come on.

4199
05:52:04,919 --> 05:52:05,639
Basement key.

4200
05:52:05,639 --> 05:52:06,599
That's not gonna do shit.

4201
05:52:07,159 --> 05:52:20,250
I don't want to get punched in the back of the head.

4202
05:52:20,970 --> 05:52:30,490
What the hell?

4203
05:52:30,490 --> 05:52:36,279
Is this a trap or is this a...

4204
05:52:37,240 --> 05:52:38,119
Why is this over here?

4205
05:52:51,659 --> 05:52:53,020
You can't be serious.

4206
05:52:53,819 --> 05:52:56,459
Did I just actually get hit right in the fucking head?

4207
05:52:57,340 --> 05:53:00,139
But a toxic...

4208
05:53:07,750 --> 05:53:08,950
Oh, my God.

4209
05:53:08,950 --> 05:53:10,229
Why do you have to be here?

4210
05:53:13,799 --> 05:53:14,840
I don't have any clumps, I don't think.

4211
05:53:15,400 --> 05:53:26,459
No, why would I have any clumps?

4212
05:53:28,919 --> 05:53:29,959
All right, I need...

4213
05:53:29,959 --> 05:53:30,759
What do I need to do?

4214
05:53:30,759 --> 05:53:31,959
I need to deactivate.

4215
05:53:31,959 --> 05:53:32,520
What do I need to do?

4216
05:53:33,159 --> 05:53:34,869
I need to...

4217
05:53:34,869 --> 05:53:35,349
I'm dead.

4218
05:53:35,909 --> 05:53:37,689
I don't even have the fucking bonfire either.

4219
05:53:38,409 --> 05:53:48,709
I don't even...

4220
05:53:48,709 --> 05:53:50,470
I don't remember this area at all either.

4221
05:53:51,590 --> 05:53:55,799
Of course you have to place those toxic enemies everywhere.

4222
05:53:56,520 --> 05:53:57,900
Like, why wouldn't you?

4223
05:53:58,540 --> 05:53:59,020
Just put...

4224
05:53:59,740 --> 05:54:01,819
Put blue dragons and toxic fucking...

4225
05:54:02,700 --> 05:54:03,580
Blow dart people.

4226
05:54:20,299 --> 05:54:22,860
I ain't ever gonna get that bonfire as long as he's in there.

4227
05:54:23,659 --> 05:54:24,619
No, I'm dead.

4228
05:54:24,619 --> 05:54:28,970
There's nothing I can do.

4229
05:54:28,970 --> 05:54:29,369
Just die.

4230
05:54:31,819 --> 05:54:32,220
Mushroom?

4231
05:54:32,220 --> 05:54:32,700
Use a...

4232
05:54:32,700 --> 05:54:33,259
What mushroom?

4233
05:54:33,819 --> 05:54:35,500
Removes plastic from the body.

4234
05:54:51,700 --> 05:54:53,540
This fucking thing has to die.

4235
05:54:54,419 --> 05:54:59,220
Where is it even aiming?

4236
05:54:59,220 --> 05:55:14,330
What's with the stamina?

4237
05:55:15,049 --> 05:55:19,290
I just cheesed this asshole.

4238
05:55:19,290 --> 05:55:19,610
All right.

4239
05:55:20,250 --> 05:55:20,569
I got...

4240
05:55:20,569 --> 05:55:34,419
I'm good.

4241
05:55:34,419 --> 05:55:35,700
Ay, yi, yi.

4242
05:55:35,700 --> 05:55:38,810
Not everything's respawned, though.

4243
05:55:39,770 --> 05:55:41,959
Not like it matters.

4244
05:55:50,659 --> 05:55:54,020
If Pinwheel is not Pinwheel and he's somebody...

4245
05:55:54,020 --> 05:55:56,099
I hope he's somebody really, really easy.

4246
05:55:56,979 --> 05:55:59,580
Please, Pinwheel.

4247
05:56:00,659 --> 05:56:01,540
Do not be...

4248
05:56:01,540 --> 05:56:03,540
Can't I just jump over this or something?

4249
05:56:03,540 --> 05:56:04,740
There's a way to do this, isn't there?

4250
05:56:05,459 --> 05:56:08,520
I can just launch over here and grab or something, right?

4251
05:56:09,080 --> 05:56:14,840
It's like right there, isn't it?

4252
05:56:15,400 --> 05:56:21,619
It's like right there, isn't it?

4253
05:56:21,619 --> 05:56:22,099
Am I...

4254
05:56:22,099 --> 05:56:23,220
I'm correct, aren't I?

4255
05:56:23,939 --> 05:56:29,479
No.

4256
05:56:30,759 --> 05:56:31,319
Is it up higher?

4257
05:56:32,439 --> 05:56:36,119
Over there?

4258
05:56:36,119 --> 05:56:38,919
I've never tried...

4259
05:56:38,919 --> 05:56:39,959
I've never done it before.

4260
05:56:39,959 --> 05:56:40,360
Right there?

4261
05:56:41,240 --> 05:56:51,779
On the other side of the bridge?

4262
05:56:58,680 --> 05:56:59,479
I've never tried it before.

4263
05:56:59,479 --> 05:57:00,439
I don't know.

4264
05:57:00,439 --> 05:57:02,040
I'm just trying to get to Pinwheel.

4265
05:57:04,340 --> 05:57:05,939
Right off the front of the bridge, okay?

4266
05:57:06,659 --> 05:57:13,159
This guy wasn't here before.

4267
05:57:13,799 --> 05:57:16,619
Is there a reason why there's a giant in the way?

4268
05:57:16,619 --> 05:57:26,340
In fact, I'm gonna like right there,

4269
05:57:26,340 --> 05:57:27,380
but there's spikes there, aren't there?

4270
05:57:28,340 --> 05:57:31,500
Won't that kill me?

4271
05:57:38,580 --> 05:57:39,459
Bottom of the bridge.

4272
05:57:39,459 --> 05:57:40,659
Like right here?

4273
05:57:41,619 --> 05:57:45,880
Is that it?

4274
05:57:46,439 --> 05:57:47,400
And is that the right way?

4275
05:57:52,279 --> 05:57:53,560
I was gonna jump over there the first time.

4276
05:57:56,119 --> 05:57:57,319
Just drop, don't jump.

4277
05:57:58,619 --> 05:57:59,259
You just...

4278
05:57:59,259 --> 05:57:59,659
Really?

4279
05:58:00,819 --> 05:58:01,380
Don't jump.

4280
05:58:01,380 --> 05:58:02,020
You just fall.

4281
05:58:07,770 --> 05:58:08,650
Just drop.

4282
05:58:08,650 --> 05:58:08,970
Really?

4283
05:58:09,610 --> 05:58:24,599
So you're talking about...

4284
05:58:25,159 --> 05:58:26,869
Let me just get this right.

4285
05:58:27,909 --> 05:58:29,270
So you're talking about just drop...

4286
05:58:29,270 --> 05:58:29,990
Oh, that little...

4287
05:58:29,990 --> 05:58:31,270
That little thing right there.

4288
05:58:31,270 --> 05:58:32,150
I see what you mean.

4289
05:58:32,150 --> 05:58:32,630
Like right...

4290
05:58:32,630 --> 05:58:33,590
That's what you're talking about, right?

4291
05:58:34,389 --> 05:58:36,099
Okay.

4292
05:58:36,900 --> 05:58:53,180
All right.

4293
05:58:53,180 --> 05:58:54,060
So now I know what that is.

4294
05:58:56,580 --> 05:58:57,860
Then you do a second drop.

4295
05:59:00,380 --> 05:59:01,580
Learning things every day here.

4296
05:59:02,220 --> 05:59:04,979
I haven't played Dark Souls Remastered in a long time,

4297
05:59:04,979 --> 05:59:06,259
but last time I played...

4298
05:59:06,259 --> 05:59:07,700
I only really completed Dark Souls

4299
05:59:07,700 --> 05:59:09,139
and played it when I streamed it.

4300
05:59:09,939 --> 05:59:13,939
Please get out of my way.

4301
05:59:15,880 --> 05:59:17,560
You're making this hard for me because I can't see.

4302
05:59:17,560 --> 05:59:18,360
You big giant.

4303
05:59:19,080 --> 05:59:20,540
Okay.

4304
05:59:24,299 --> 05:59:25,500
Why did you come down here?

4305
05:59:31,529 --> 05:59:33,610
Did you see me do that or something?

4306
05:59:33,610 --> 05:59:34,409
I don't understand.

4307
05:59:36,360 --> 05:59:36,840
Okay.

4308
05:59:36,840 --> 05:59:38,520
Well, that's good.

4309
05:59:39,080 --> 05:59:39,479
I wonder if...

4310
05:59:39,479 --> 05:59:40,200
Can I just go in here?

4311
05:59:47,580 --> 05:59:48,779
Aren't I getting close to Pinwheel?

4312
05:59:52,090 --> 05:59:53,049
This is Manus, right?

4313
05:59:53,049 --> 05:59:53,610
Oh, Nito.

4314
05:59:54,869 --> 05:59:55,830
There's an item down there.

4315
05:59:58,060 --> 05:59:59,659
Doesn't Nito like come pick you up?

4316
06:00:06,810 --> 06:00:08,409
You lie in the coffin, he drags you in.

4317
06:00:13,619 --> 06:00:13,860
All right.

4318
06:00:13,860 --> 06:00:15,139
So let's drop again.

4319
06:00:17,979 --> 06:00:18,380
But where...

4320
06:00:19,020 --> 06:00:19,740
I'm just going to be careful.

4321
06:00:22,009 --> 06:00:22,810
So drop again.

4322
06:00:23,689 --> 06:00:24,330
Where though?

4323
06:00:24,889 --> 06:00:25,610
Over there?

4324
06:00:25,610 --> 06:00:25,930
Okay.

4325
06:00:29,060 --> 06:00:30,180
And it's a cool item,

4326
06:00:30,180 --> 06:00:31,619
but it's definitely not the item you think it is.

4327
06:00:35,180 --> 06:00:35,500
All right.

4328
06:00:47,060 --> 06:00:47,860
Holy shit.

4329
06:00:53,099 --> 06:00:54,540
The giant came down.

4330
06:00:55,720 --> 06:00:56,840
Everybody came down.

4331
06:01:00,099 --> 06:01:00,979
And now...

4332
06:01:00,979 --> 06:01:02,259
I bad-grewed everything somehow.

4333
06:01:03,459 --> 06:01:04,099
Just run.

4334
06:01:04,659 --> 06:01:06,099
I'm not dealing with this bullshit.

4335
06:01:06,099 --> 06:01:07,380
Everybody just got hit by the grenade.

4336
06:01:08,259 --> 06:01:11,860
Don't do this to me.

4337
06:01:21,779 --> 06:01:22,740
Unfucking believable.

4338
06:01:24,500 --> 06:01:25,619
Unfucking believable.

4339
06:01:27,180 --> 06:01:27,419
Just...

4340
06:01:28,700 --> 06:01:33,500
Just big obnoxious fucks always in the way.

4341
06:01:33,500 --> 06:01:41,659
I'm just trying to run those boars,

4342
06:01:41,659 --> 06:01:45,500
the boars and the rats on this randomizer night.

4343
06:01:45,500 --> 06:01:48,860
They haven't done anything but just be gigantic assets

4344
06:01:48,860 --> 06:01:49,900
that just get in the way.

4345
06:01:49,900 --> 06:01:50,939
They don't do anything else.

4346
06:01:50,939 --> 06:01:51,659
They don't even fight you.

4347
06:01:51,659 --> 06:01:52,299
They don't even attack.

4348
06:01:53,020 --> 06:01:54,540
They just get in the fucking way.

4349
06:01:55,779 --> 06:01:57,139
They're just kaizo blocks.

4350
06:01:57,139 --> 06:01:58,180
They don't even do anything.

4351
06:01:58,900 --> 06:02:08,950
Don't come down here.

4352
06:02:09,590 --> 06:02:12,229
Is he dead?

4353
06:02:27,450 --> 06:02:27,849
What?

4354
06:02:27,849 --> 06:02:28,090
Oh.

4355
06:02:28,729 --> 06:02:35,689
And it's always a chef.

4356
06:02:36,409 --> 06:02:37,930
I'm gonna fucking kill this chef.

4357
06:02:45,830 --> 06:02:46,470
All right.

4358
06:02:46,470 --> 06:02:58,819
Are you guys ready?

4359
06:02:59,380 --> 06:03:00,790
I think it's time.

4360
06:03:01,430 --> 06:03:04,299
Here we go.

4361
06:03:04,299 --> 06:03:06,380
It's time for me to beat the real Pinwheel.

4362
06:03:15,509 --> 06:03:32,490
Who is it?

4363
06:03:36,709 --> 06:03:37,430
Somebody easy.

4364
06:03:38,069 --> 06:03:59,029
What is it?

4365
06:03:59,029 --> 06:03:59,669
Wait.

4366
06:03:59,669 --> 06:04:02,380
Doesn't this guy spawn like a hundred skeletons?

4367
06:04:09,450 --> 06:04:10,090
Oh no.

4368
06:04:12,380 --> 06:04:22,869
He...

4369
06:04:22,869 --> 06:04:23,909
Pinwheel, Nito.

4370
06:04:24,549 --> 06:04:27,180
Doesn't he do like a big explosion?

4371
06:04:28,419 --> 06:04:29,939
I'm not gonna be able to get away from that.

4372
06:04:29,939 --> 06:04:31,139
It's gonna hit me every time, I think.

4373
06:04:38,599 --> 06:04:39,560
There's the real enemy.

4374
06:04:45,220 --> 06:04:46,659
There he is.

4375
06:04:46,659 --> 06:04:55,080
I killed Pinwheel.

4376
06:04:55,080 --> 06:04:56,700
I killed Pinwheel.

4377
06:04:56,700 --> 06:04:57,419
That was Pinwheel.

4378
06:04:57,419 --> 06:04:59,020
Pinwheel was spawned and I killed Pinwheel.

4379
06:04:59,020 --> 06:05:06,139
I win.

4380
06:05:06,139 --> 06:05:06,939
Sorry, guys.

4381
06:05:06,939 --> 06:05:07,659
That's how it works.

4382
06:05:08,220 --> 06:05:10,740
I died to Nito.

4383
06:05:10,740 --> 06:05:12,099
I killed Pinwheel.

4384
06:05:12,099 --> 06:05:15,770
That's a victory.

4385
06:05:15,770 --> 06:05:26,340
I missed.

4386
06:05:27,340 --> 06:05:28,380
If it wasn't, fuck.

4387
06:05:28,380 --> 06:05:29,180
I already won.

4388
06:05:29,180 --> 06:05:30,139
I already won.

4389
06:05:30,139 --> 06:05:31,659
Now that stream's over.

4390
06:05:32,220 --> 06:05:32,939
I killed Pinwheel.

4391
06:05:35,689 --> 06:05:36,650
The giant was in the way.

4392
06:05:36,650 --> 06:05:37,290
I couldn't see.

4393
06:05:39,049 --> 06:05:39,930
It's over.

4394
06:05:39,930 --> 06:05:40,490
I beat him.

4395
06:05:42,700 --> 06:05:43,419
You all saw it.

4396
06:05:43,419 --> 06:05:44,380
I don't need any more proof.

4397
06:05:46,470 --> 06:05:48,310
The name tag said Pinwheel.

4398
06:05:48,310 --> 06:05:49,189
I killed Pinwheel.

4399
06:06:00,490 --> 06:06:01,610
He nudged me a little bit.

4400
06:06:03,720 --> 06:06:06,759
Why does he have to be standing in the exact place that I won?

4401
06:06:26,569 --> 06:06:28,330
Have I eaten a McChicken yet?

4402
06:06:28,330 --> 06:06:28,970
Yeah.

4403
06:06:28,970 --> 06:06:29,689
Yeah, I have.

4404
06:06:29,689 --> 06:06:30,189
Yes.

4405
06:07:03,099 --> 06:07:06,540
I can't kill Nito with like in 30 seconds.

4406
06:07:08,220 --> 06:07:08,700
All right, here we go.

4407
06:07:08,700 --> 06:07:16,340
I have to kill Nito in like 12 seconds with like 30% health.

4408
06:07:41,930 --> 06:07:42,810
Got him.

4409
06:07:42,810 --> 06:07:44,330
No, you don't get to say shit.

4410
06:07:44,330 --> 06:07:51,619
You thought it was going to happen, but it didn't.

4411
06:07:51,619 --> 06:07:53,700
I just want to close the book on this.

4412
06:07:59,270 --> 06:08:00,709
All right, the book is closing on this.

4413
06:08:04,150 --> 06:08:06,229
If I wasn't toxic, and you know what?

4414
06:08:06,229 --> 06:08:08,869
I'm going to dump a humanity into this.

4415
06:08:11,540 --> 06:08:12,419
Who really cares?

4416
06:08:12,419 --> 06:08:13,939
I'm just going to take three humanities.

4417
06:08:14,580 --> 06:08:25,130
I have to at least try.

4418
06:08:25,770 --> 06:08:40,650
I cannot do this twice, right?

4419
06:08:47,700 --> 06:08:48,340
Summon help?

4420
06:08:49,220 --> 06:09:04,150
I don't think I want to go online with this because it might be bad.

4421
06:09:08,659 --> 06:09:10,900
All right, please just get out of the way.

4422
06:09:10,900 --> 06:09:12,099
No toxic bullshit.

4423
06:09:12,979 --> 06:09:16,009
There it is.

4424
06:09:16,729 --> 06:09:18,659
He's going to try to smash me.

4425
06:09:18,659 --> 06:09:19,299
Don't let him.

4426
06:09:19,299 --> 06:09:20,659
Yep, I knew it was coming.

4427
06:09:21,380 --> 06:09:25,299
Why am I online?

4428
06:09:25,860 --> 06:09:40,520
That's an NPC.

4429
06:09:41,080 --> 06:09:44,150
Here we go.

4430
06:09:44,150 --> 06:09:44,790
All right, let's try.

4431
06:09:45,349 --> 06:10:20,819
Is there enough room?

4432
06:10:21,939 --> 06:10:36,810
I just barely have to go all the way to the end.

4433
06:10:36,810 --> 06:10:37,610
Is there enough room?

4434
06:10:39,619 --> 06:10:40,500
God damn it.

4435
06:10:40,500 --> 06:10:41,060
It's close.

4436
06:10:41,700 --> 06:10:42,900
I got to keep him at this side.

4437
06:10:43,619 --> 06:10:55,290
I think this is too close.

4438
06:10:55,290 --> 06:10:55,770
I'm dead.

4439
06:10:56,330 --> 06:10:59,619
Oh, that sucks.

4440
06:11:00,340 --> 06:11:18,840
See, I already killed the pinwheel so he's not spawning.

4441
06:11:48,500 --> 06:12:03,979
This is too many.

4442
06:12:03,979 --> 06:12:07,340
There's like 15 pinwheels in that room.

4443
06:12:07,340 --> 06:12:08,139
So yes, guys.

4444
06:12:08,700 --> 06:12:14,380
Yes, I died to a room that had Nito and 15 pinwheels in it.

4445
06:12:14,380 --> 06:12:15,180
All right?

4446
06:12:15,180 --> 06:12:16,299
Yeah, sure.

4447
06:12:16,299 --> 06:12:17,580
I will take that loss.

4448
06:12:17,580 --> 06:12:28,900
That's okay, but it's not even real.

4449
06:12:28,900 --> 06:12:30,259
Thanks for watching, everybody.

4450
06:12:30,259 --> 06:12:31,540
Hope you have a happy Fourth of July.

4451
06:12:33,139 --> 06:12:35,459
They die in one hit, but that doesn't matter.

4452
06:12:39,849 --> 06:12:41,770
Yeah, ants die in one hit too.

4453
06:12:41,770 --> 06:12:44,009
But if there's a thousand of them, you're gonna die.

4454
06:12:54,970 --> 06:12:57,450
If you get swarmed by like two or three thousand ants,

4455
06:12:57,450 --> 06:12:58,009
you're dead.

4456
06:12:58,009 --> 06:12:58,889
You're gonna die.

4457
06:12:58,889 --> 06:13:00,569
You're gonna get like stung in the face and shit.

4458
06:13:01,540 --> 06:13:02,180
Oh my god.

4459
06:13:02,180 --> 06:13:03,299
All right, the stream's actually over.

4460
06:13:05,880 --> 06:13:07,000
I can't attempt this again.

4461
06:13:12,330 --> 06:13:14,409
He was deposing.

4462
06:13:22,200 --> 06:13:23,080
All right, that's it.

4463
06:13:23,080 --> 06:13:23,479
That's it.

4464
06:13:23,479 --> 06:13:25,319
I am not doing it anymore.

4465
06:13:35,880 --> 06:13:36,520
Didn't puke.

4466
06:13:39,779 --> 06:13:40,340
I just did.

4467
06:13:43,639 --> 06:13:44,439
Fuck you, man.

4468
06:14:15,799 --> 06:14:16,599
Why did I just do that?

4469
06:14:37,110 --> 06:14:38,150
All right, quiet time.

4470
06:14:39,189 --> 06:14:39,590
Here we go.

4471
06:14:40,659 --> 06:14:41,619
Real attempt.

4472
06:14:41,619 --> 06:15:25,930
How the fuck am I not hitting this guy?

4473
06:15:27,290 --> 06:15:31,430
Okay, here come the pinwheels.

4474
06:15:32,069 --> 06:16:00,220
Oh shit, I'm gonna get hit by this.

4475
06:16:00,220 --> 06:16:23,720
I gotta tank one.

4476
06:16:23,720 --> 06:16:24,840
Look, look, what do you mean look?

4477
06:16:25,479 --> 06:16:27,659
What am I looking at?

4478
06:16:27,659 --> 06:16:28,459
Why am I looking at chat?

4479
06:16:34,709 --> 06:16:38,520
Pinwheel is officially dead.

4480
06:16:49,049 --> 06:16:55,750
I did not lose to pinwheel.

4481
06:16:55,750 --> 06:16:58,150
Three tries to beat the real pinwheel.

4482
06:17:02,680 --> 06:17:06,520
Hey, now I'm like satisfied and I can turn this stream off.

4483
06:17:06,520 --> 06:17:07,000
That's it.

4484
06:17:07,639 --> 06:17:12,869
That was Dark Souls randomizer items and enemies and bosses and shit.

4485
06:17:14,060 --> 06:17:14,779
It was really fun.

4486
06:17:15,659 --> 06:17:17,020
It was a little ridiculous,

4487
06:17:17,020 --> 06:17:19,799
but you can probably hear some of the fireworks right now.

4488
06:17:20,599 --> 06:17:24,869
People uh, July 3rd and July 4th.

4489
06:17:26,919 --> 06:17:27,560
Uh, that's gonna be it.

4490
06:17:27,560 --> 06:17:28,599
I'll see you guys in a couple days.

4491
06:17:29,159 --> 06:17:29,799
I'll let you know.

4492
06:17:29,799 --> 06:17:30,520
Check the sus.

4493
06:17:30,520 --> 06:17:31,959
It'll probably be either Friday or Saturday.

4494
06:17:34,250 --> 06:17:40,250
And we got 20 community subs from cyanide and five from play for doctor.

4495
06:17:42,069 --> 06:17:42,790
Thank you both of you.

4496
06:17:42,790 --> 06:17:43,590
Thank you cyanide.

4497
06:17:43,590 --> 06:17:45,909
That's hundreds of dollars at this point, right?

4498
06:17:46,549 --> 06:17:48,229
That's like 50 community subs tonight.

4499
06:17:49,830 --> 06:17:51,830
Jesus.

4500
06:17:51,830 --> 06:17:52,229
Thank you.

4501
06:17:57,060 --> 06:17:58,180
Happy 4th of July.

4502
06:17:58,180 --> 06:17:59,060
I'll see you real soon.

4503
06:17:59,619 --> 06:18:03,819
Will I do a Dark Souls 3 randomizer?

4504
06:18:03,979 --> 06:18:06,060
I did a lot of weird Dark Souls 3 stuff before.

4505
06:18:07,099 --> 06:18:15,290
I was played as bosses and times 20 speed and slow motion.

4506
06:18:15,290 --> 06:18:16,490
I had a lot of mods before.

4507
06:18:17,459 --> 06:18:20,580
First person mod, which was really fun until you get to a boss.

4508
06:18:25,560 --> 06:18:33,020
But yeah, you can find these on uh, the Nexus mods guy has a page.

4509
06:18:33,740 --> 06:18:38,580
But yeah, thanks everybody.

4510
06:18:38,580 --> 06:18:39,060
See you soon.

4511
06:18:39,060 --> 06:18:39,779
We're going to do the bits.

4512
06:18:40,659 --> 06:18:41,540
Hope you enjoyed it.

4513
06:18:41,540 --> 06:18:43,619
That was exactly what I thought it was going to be.

4514
06:18:46,810 --> 06:18:48,580
It was a lot of fun.

4515
06:18:48,580 --> 06:18:49,700
Do Dark Souls 2.

4516
06:18:50,259 --> 06:19:02,650
What am I doing tomorrow?

4517
06:19:02,650 --> 06:19:04,889
Me and Kim are going to go.

4518
06:19:04,889 --> 06:19:09,529
We're probably going to be just somewhere in Vegas to see the fireworks.

4519
06:19:10,169 --> 06:19:17,159
Because I'm pretty sure they do like a pretty big display at every major casino

4520
06:19:17,159 --> 06:19:18,439
and resort and stuff.

4521
06:19:18,439 --> 06:19:19,560
So I think we're gonna go see it.

4522
06:19:20,439 --> 06:19:32,069
But let's go back to earlier this afternoon.

4523
06:19:34,650 --> 06:19:36,409
We had snoozing copter with 250.

4524
06:19:37,209 --> 06:19:38,169
Thank you snoozing copter.

4525
06:19:39,189 --> 06:19:41,029
Can't watch for long because I work tomorrow.

4526
06:19:41,029 --> 06:19:43,750
I know we are obligated to watch, but I can't.

4527
06:19:43,750 --> 06:19:44,630
I'm sorry.

4528
06:19:44,630 --> 06:19:46,229
Please don't ban me like all the others.

4529
06:19:46,869 --> 06:19:49,830
Anyway, years back, you told us about a smoothie drink you made every morning.

4530
06:19:49,830 --> 06:19:51,990
The only thing I remember was frozen strawberries, I think.

4531
06:19:52,549 --> 06:19:54,229
What are the other ingredients?

4532
06:19:54,229 --> 06:19:56,709
Also, when was the last time you actually went to the gym?

4533
06:19:56,709 --> 06:19:59,029
I'm curious because you still look like you're in shape.

4534
06:20:02,779 --> 06:20:04,860
Well, the you're talking about banana.

4535
06:20:06,220 --> 06:20:11,349
So Greek yogurt, a banana, strawberries,

4536
06:20:11,990 --> 06:20:17,509
and coconut water or milk or almond milk.

4537
06:20:17,509 --> 06:20:18,790
I would not do regular milk.

4538
06:20:19,430 --> 06:20:23,349
I would do a lighter milk because the banana and the yogurt is already really heavy.

4539
06:20:23,349 --> 06:20:24,630
You don't want to really weigh it down.

4540
06:20:25,430 --> 06:20:28,740
I used to drink that all the time.

4541
06:20:36,540 --> 06:20:37,340
Doctors hate them.

4542
06:20:39,270 --> 06:20:43,349
Or if you want to do peanut butter, peanut butter and banana

4543
06:20:44,659 --> 06:20:48,180
with the same base of that Greek yogurt and almond milk.

4544
06:20:48,900 --> 06:20:51,639
Not as heavy.

4545
06:20:51,639 --> 06:20:52,520
It tastes awesome.

4546
06:20:53,159 --> 06:20:58,520
You can throw in some whey protein, too, if you really wanted to.

4547
06:20:59,400 --> 06:21:02,310
Almond milk is bad.

4548
06:21:02,310 --> 06:21:03,669
I can't drink it straight.

4549
06:21:03,669 --> 06:21:06,310
Yeah, but almond milk is really, really good to mix with a bunch of other stuff.

4550
06:21:06,950 --> 06:21:11,450
Almond milk tastes the most like milk to me

4551
06:21:11,450 --> 06:21:14,729
when it's mixed with other things that you usually would mix milk with stuff.

4552
06:21:18,549 --> 06:21:21,990
It's a good milk substitute for a lot of things that require milk.

4553
06:21:22,630 --> 06:21:27,259
I just said the same thing,

4554
06:21:28,220 --> 06:21:30,700
but the second time I actually made it a coherent state.

4555
06:21:31,419 --> 06:21:34,119
I translated it for you.

4556
06:21:34,840 --> 06:21:38,700
But now I haven't been to the gym in a while.

4557
06:21:40,380 --> 06:21:41,500
I walk around a lot, though.

4558
06:21:42,500 --> 06:21:44,180
It's so nice out over here.

4559
06:21:44,180 --> 06:21:45,540
It's so hot out every day.

4560
06:21:46,729 --> 06:21:50,169
I kind of make it a mission to at least get outside and move around and walk around.

4561
06:21:51,049 --> 06:21:55,049
So I do stay active, but I'm not lifting weights anymore.

4562
06:21:56,470 --> 06:21:58,229
My back is all fucked up.

4563
06:21:58,229 --> 06:21:59,430
I can't really can't do it anymore.

4564
06:22:00,150 --> 06:22:07,819
I don't know.

4565
06:22:07,819 --> 06:22:09,180
Something happened like a couple years ago

4566
06:22:09,180 --> 06:22:11,020
and I just started to get really tight back there.

4567
06:22:11,020 --> 06:22:13,900
So it's hard to really do much lifting-wise.

4568
06:22:13,900 --> 06:22:15,180
I mean, if I can move around, fine.

4569
06:22:15,180 --> 06:22:16,540
I can run.

4570
06:22:16,540 --> 06:22:17,180
I can jump.

4571
06:22:17,180 --> 06:22:17,900
I can dash.

4572
06:22:17,900 --> 06:22:18,540
I can slide.

4573
06:22:19,580 --> 06:22:25,590
But lifting weights is kind of like off the table, I would say.

4574
06:22:29,939 --> 06:22:30,580
Triple jump?

4575
06:22:30,580 --> 06:22:32,419
Nah, I can double jump, though.

4576
06:22:34,599 --> 06:22:36,200
But C4G, thanks for the 250.

4577
06:22:36,200 --> 06:22:37,880
Ignore that last guy and ban them.

4578
06:22:38,439 --> 06:22:43,900
We don't ban anybody here unless they do something wrong.

4579
06:22:43,900 --> 06:22:44,860
Or they break a rule.

4580
06:22:45,580 --> 06:22:48,310
Or I just look at you and go, you're out.

4581
06:22:49,029 --> 06:22:51,380
Or if you make fun of me.

4582
06:22:51,380 --> 06:22:54,979
Or if you backseat too much.

4583
06:22:54,979 --> 06:22:58,180
Or if you disrespect somebody in the chat.

4584
06:22:58,819 --> 06:23:01,860
We don't ban anybody here unless you do any of those things.

4585
06:23:01,860 --> 06:23:07,689
How much did you bench?

4586
06:23:07,689 --> 06:23:10,250
I used to back in the day.

4587
06:23:10,250 --> 06:23:12,490
Somewhere around like 2011, 2012.

4588
06:23:13,529 --> 06:23:17,099
I could do like 215.

4589
06:23:17,979 --> 06:23:19,180
Like three or four times.

4590
06:23:19,740 --> 06:23:20,700
And then I had to put it up.

4591
06:23:22,389 --> 06:23:23,509
I also weighed.

4592
06:23:25,060 --> 06:23:27,060
I was a lot heavier than I am now.

4593
06:23:28,459 --> 06:23:32,060
I topped, I think I was like 165 or like 170 or something.

4594
06:23:32,060 --> 06:23:36,939
168 when I was at my most stacked up human.

4595
06:23:39,020 --> 06:23:42,580
I think like two, it was over 200.

4596
06:23:42,580 --> 06:23:44,180
I know it was at least like 200, 215.

4597
06:23:44,180 --> 06:23:45,939
That I did at least two or three, like four times.

4598
06:23:48,869 --> 06:23:50,630
They say as long as you can do your body weight,

4599
06:23:51,700 --> 06:23:52,819
then that's pretty good.

4600
06:23:52,819 --> 06:23:53,700
That's actually really good.

4601
06:23:54,580 --> 06:23:58,790
I've since come way down.

4602
06:23:58,790 --> 06:24:01,750
I mean I'm probably like 155 pounds now.

4603
06:24:01,750 --> 06:24:03,830
154 maybe.

4604
06:24:08,939 --> 06:24:11,560
Yeah, I was 168.

4605
06:24:12,200 --> 06:24:13,720
I'm now like 150.

4606
06:24:14,520 --> 06:24:15,500
Maybe a little bit more.

4607
06:24:16,139 --> 06:24:18,700
That's great for your weight.

4608
06:24:18,700 --> 06:24:19,580
Oh yeah, man.

4609
06:24:19,580 --> 06:24:24,939
I used to do 35 pound dumbbells to curl with.

4610
06:24:25,659 --> 06:24:28,169
I don't think I could do with two hands.

4611
06:24:28,169 --> 06:24:31,049
Pick up a 35 pound dumbbell and put it over my head right now.

4612
06:24:31,610 --> 06:24:33,689
I think back at the shit that I was doing and I'm going,

4613
06:24:33,689 --> 06:24:35,290
how the how did I do that?

4614
06:24:36,009 --> 06:24:37,689
I can't even pick up one.

4615
06:24:38,650 --> 06:24:46,790
I was really into it though.

4616
06:24:48,259 --> 06:24:49,779
I was super passionate about it.

4617
06:24:49,779 --> 06:24:50,900
I was really into it.

4618
06:24:50,900 --> 06:24:54,659
I was super into being healthy and eating really, really good

4619
06:24:54,659 --> 06:24:57,380
and going to the gym and doing it right.

4620
06:24:57,380 --> 06:24:59,060
Trying to do as good form as I can.

4621
06:25:00,919 --> 06:25:03,560
Going four or five days a week.

4622
06:25:03,560 --> 06:25:04,759
Not working the same muscle groups.

4623
06:25:04,759 --> 06:25:06,360
I'm talking Monday is chest.

4624
06:25:06,919 --> 06:25:10,119
You know, Tuesday is what you usually do.

4625
06:25:10,119 --> 06:25:12,599
Like chest and tris back and bis is what you do.

4626
06:25:13,639 --> 06:25:17,299
And then you give your day of rest and you come back and do legs.

4627
06:25:18,259 --> 06:25:19,380
You do back core.

4628
06:25:20,020 --> 06:25:22,619
I was out of the gym four or five days a week.

4629
06:25:23,419 --> 06:25:29,990
I was so into it, but you kind of have to be

4630
06:25:29,990 --> 06:25:32,470
to be able to have like real results.

4631
06:25:32,470 --> 06:25:35,029
If you want to be, oh, you know, I want to get jacked.

4632
06:25:36,250 --> 06:25:39,049
It becomes a part-time job that you have to fulfill.

4633
06:25:40,540 --> 06:25:42,700
And it got to the point where I started caring more about

4634
06:25:44,169 --> 06:25:45,770
hanging out and making a YouTube video

4635
06:25:45,770 --> 06:25:47,369
than going to the gym for three hours.

4636
06:25:48,090 --> 06:25:50,680
So really it was making YouTube videos

4637
06:25:50,840 --> 06:25:52,840
is what kept me back in the house.

4638
06:25:52,840 --> 06:25:54,680
And I was like, no, I don't feel like doing that.

4639
06:25:54,680 --> 06:25:56,360
I want to play like GTA four.

4640
06:26:00,150 --> 06:26:01,349
I became a gamer.

4641
06:26:01,349 --> 06:26:05,299
Yeah, but it's all good.

4642
06:26:05,299 --> 06:26:08,119
I started, I still try to save as healthy as I can.

4643
06:26:11,299 --> 06:26:14,700
You can be healthy without lifting weights.

4644
06:26:14,700 --> 06:26:17,209
As long as you keep yourself fairly active

4645
06:26:17,209 --> 06:26:18,729
and you eat right, you'll be all right.

4646
06:26:21,340 --> 06:26:26,360
But thank you to C4G again, C4G again for the 250.

4647
06:26:26,360 --> 06:26:27,319
Also bots back.

4648
06:26:27,319 --> 06:26:28,279
Thanks for clearing it up.

4649
06:26:28,919 --> 06:26:30,840
Here's the stats of some previous streams.

4650
06:26:30,840 --> 06:26:38,310
If you are curious, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on.

4651
06:26:38,310 --> 06:26:39,270
What happened?

4652
06:26:39,270 --> 06:26:41,029
Oh, I know this is this.

4653
06:26:41,029 --> 06:26:41,909
I love data.

4654
06:26:42,790 --> 06:26:43,830
This is awesome.

4655
06:26:48,259 --> 06:26:50,020
I want to go over these because this is great.

4656
06:26:53,430 --> 06:26:54,389
Let's go over these charts.

4657
06:26:54,950 --> 06:27:02,900
I'm going to put them on the screen.

4658
06:27:04,310 --> 06:27:08,470
So we've got these are the amount of plus twos and minus twos

4659
06:27:08,470 --> 06:27:09,750
and it's in a chart sense.

4660
06:27:10,310 --> 06:27:13,380
Let's get them on the screen so you can see.

4661
06:27:13,380 --> 06:27:21,369
This is very interesting.

4662
06:27:21,369 --> 06:27:27,299
Here we go.

4663
06:27:27,299 --> 06:27:28,020
There's another one.

4664
06:27:28,819 --> 06:27:30,259
There's three in total here.

4665
06:27:31,220 --> 06:27:38,009
This one is great.

4666
06:27:38,569 --> 06:27:39,610
This is my favorite one.

4667
06:27:40,330 --> 06:27:43,580
All right.

4668
06:27:43,580 --> 06:27:45,900
So this is the deep rock galactic stream.

4669
06:27:47,560 --> 06:27:51,880
So as you notice, there's a huge decline in the very beginning here.

4670
06:27:52,840 --> 06:27:56,279
And the reason for that is because the stream started

4671
06:27:56,279 --> 06:28:00,040
and once we got going, Star and I pretended

4672
06:28:00,919 --> 06:28:04,540
that we were just going to sit there silent playing the game.

4673
06:28:04,540 --> 06:28:05,259
We were doing the...

4674
06:28:06,139 --> 06:28:06,779
Yeah, what do you got?

4675
06:28:07,580 --> 06:28:08,810
Yeah, send it over here.

4676
06:28:09,450 --> 06:28:13,080
Okay, yeah, we did that for about a half an hour.

4677
06:28:15,180 --> 06:28:15,979
Everybody hated it.

4678
06:28:15,979 --> 06:28:16,700
Let's see.

4679
06:28:16,700 --> 06:28:18,860
I mean, people thought it was absolutely terrible.

4680
06:28:21,000 --> 06:28:21,880
And we came right back.

4681
06:28:21,880 --> 06:28:23,080
We bounced right back.

4682
06:28:23,959 --> 06:28:26,759
I think I fell off the cliff and that's where it just jumped.

4683
06:28:29,900 --> 06:28:30,860
It was like five minutes.

4684
06:28:30,860 --> 06:28:32,459
Yeah, well, I'm embellishing.

4685
06:28:33,400 --> 06:28:36,520
And then near the end here when we started to do the soundboard stuff

4686
06:28:37,900 --> 06:28:38,540
really picked up.

4687
06:28:38,540 --> 06:28:39,259
That's really funny.

4688
06:28:39,259 --> 06:28:40,299
But this one, this is...

4689
06:28:40,299 --> 06:28:40,779
What's this one?

4690
06:28:40,779 --> 06:28:41,900
This is the Mario Maker.

4691
06:28:42,779 --> 06:28:44,819
So this is Mario Maker.

4692
06:28:44,819 --> 06:28:48,819
So what happened in the middle that was so funny?

4693
06:28:50,419 --> 06:28:51,939
And then what happened at the...

4694
06:28:51,939 --> 06:28:54,180
Somewhere an hour before the end of the stream

4695
06:28:54,180 --> 06:28:56,180
where it was like, holy shit, I hate this.

4696
06:28:56,180 --> 06:28:59,139
And then we bounced way back near the end.

4697
06:29:00,099 --> 06:29:01,540
This is all over the place.

4698
06:29:02,259 --> 06:29:10,330
It was the car.

4699
06:29:10,970 --> 06:29:19,189
That's so funny.

4700
06:29:21,880 --> 06:29:24,200
Oh, the McChicken was right at the end.

4701
06:29:24,200 --> 06:29:25,639
Right there at the very end.

4702
06:29:26,279 --> 06:29:47,029
And this last one was Space Engine and Cook Serve Delicious.

4703
06:29:49,689 --> 06:29:50,970
I don't know what happened here.

4704
06:29:54,470 --> 06:29:56,069
Still at minus 50.

4705
06:29:56,069 --> 06:29:58,069
Well, these are only three that were taken.

4706
06:29:58,069 --> 06:29:58,709
There's a lot.

4707
06:30:00,889 --> 06:30:02,330
This was a really funny stream.

4708
06:30:03,049 --> 06:30:07,750
I think the Flush joke happened, right?

4709
06:30:07,750 --> 06:30:08,549
See that first peak?

4710
06:30:09,349 --> 06:30:14,549
Yo, then I said...

4711
06:30:14,549 --> 06:30:15,029
Yeah, you're right.

4712
06:30:15,029 --> 06:30:15,590
I said, Shpee.

4713
06:30:16,919 --> 06:30:19,159
Somewhere in there I said Shpee and we rocketed.

4714
06:30:19,159 --> 06:30:20,919
We went parabolic after I said Shpee.

4715
06:30:21,799 --> 06:30:25,740
There was no stopping it.

4716
06:30:25,740 --> 06:30:33,139
That's interesting though.

4717
06:30:40,060 --> 06:30:40,860
So what was today?

4718
06:30:44,700 --> 06:30:45,500
7.42.

4719
06:30:46,139 --> 06:30:49,720
So what was yesterday?

4720
06:30:49,720 --> 06:30:50,759
And do we have any idea?

4721
06:30:52,040 --> 06:30:56,700
That's not bad.

4722
06:30:57,770 --> 06:30:58,970
Yesterday was like 500.

4723
06:31:04,470 --> 06:31:05,750
Oh yeah, it was off yesterday, right?

4724
06:31:06,470 --> 06:31:09,700
That's so funny.

4725
06:31:09,700 --> 06:31:10,419
That's great though.

4726
06:31:10,419 --> 06:31:12,099
Thanks for the charts.

4727
06:31:12,099 --> 06:31:12,900
It's funny to look at.

4728
06:31:12,900 --> 06:31:15,849
It's interesting just to see what works

4729
06:31:15,849 --> 06:31:17,450
and what doesn't in real time almost.

4730
06:31:17,450 --> 06:31:18,009
It's interesting.

4731
06:31:19,430 --> 06:31:20,470
But thanks for the 250.

4732
06:31:21,770 --> 06:31:23,770
Thank you, S10W Update for the $5.

4733
06:31:24,729 --> 06:31:27,290
Hey, Jerma985 of the hit YouTube channel,

4734
06:31:27,290 --> 06:31:28,169
Jerma985.

4735
06:31:28,169 --> 06:31:29,529
Back to donate here again after...

4736
06:31:30,409 --> 06:31:32,490
Even after the horrifying McChicken eating.

4737
06:31:32,490 --> 06:31:33,930
Hope to donate lots more now

4738
06:31:33,930 --> 06:31:35,610
and good luck with life.

4739
06:31:35,610 --> 06:31:36,110
Enjoy.

4740
06:31:41,459 --> 06:31:42,740
Those McChickens were pretty good.

4741
06:31:45,080 --> 06:31:46,040
What am I gonna eat tonight?

4742
06:31:47,000 --> 06:31:47,720
Something healthy.

4743
06:31:48,279 --> 06:31:49,720
I'm talking about lifting weights

4744
06:31:49,720 --> 06:31:50,439
and being at the gym.

4745
06:31:50,439 --> 06:31:51,639
I need to eat something good.

4746
06:31:52,360 --> 06:31:59,459
I'll think about that.

4747
06:31:59,459 --> 06:32:01,779
But thank you for the $5, S10W Update.

4748
06:32:01,779 --> 06:32:02,279
Appreciate it.

4749
06:32:03,779 --> 06:32:05,060
I will do my best.

4750
06:32:05,860 --> 06:32:08,060
Good luck with your life too.

4751
06:32:10,139 --> 06:32:11,340
Jerma lied about Taco Bell.

4752
06:32:11,340 --> 06:32:12,060
Thanks for the $3.

4753
06:32:12,060 --> 06:32:12,540
Hey, Jerma.

4754
06:32:12,540 --> 06:32:13,740
Can't stick around for the whole stream

4755
06:32:13,740 --> 06:32:14,860
but I just saw Spider-Man.

4756
06:32:15,500 --> 06:32:16,380
No spoilers.

4757
06:32:16,380 --> 06:32:18,299
But it was a super good movie.

4758
06:32:18,939 --> 06:32:23,259
I heard it was fantastic.

4759
06:32:27,689 --> 06:32:29,689
Yeah, I'm not gonna read anymore.

4760
06:32:29,689 --> 06:32:30,169
I don't...

4761
06:32:30,169 --> 06:32:31,610
I know there's no spoilers in this message

4762
06:32:31,610 --> 06:32:32,889
but I don't want to even say the words...

4763
06:32:34,250 --> 06:32:34,729
That word.

4764
06:32:34,729 --> 06:32:37,290
The guy that is the bug with eight legs.

4765
06:32:38,169 --> 06:32:40,340
But I heard it is fantastic.

4766
06:32:45,290 --> 06:32:46,889
Thank you, Jerma lied about Taco Bell.

4767
06:32:46,889 --> 06:32:48,569
I'm actually looking forward to seeing it.

4768
06:32:48,810 --> 06:32:50,490
I heard it was really good.

4769
06:32:52,759 --> 06:32:53,479
Sol Harv.

4770
06:32:53,479 --> 06:32:54,360
Thanks for the $2.50.

4771
06:32:54,919 --> 06:32:55,319
Hey, Jerma.

4772
06:32:55,319 --> 06:32:56,439
For your next burger eating stream,

4773
06:32:56,439 --> 06:33:00,200
may I suggest reviewing the new Cheetos and chicken burger from KFC?

4774
06:33:00,200 --> 06:33:03,240
It goes great with a cup of coffee to wash it down.

4775
06:33:03,959 --> 06:33:08,889
I feel like that's the only opportunity I'm ever gonna have

4776
06:33:09,450 --> 06:33:12,250
to solidify that joke in history forever.

4777
06:33:17,220 --> 06:33:20,979
Do I eat the KFC Cheetos chicken sandwich

4778
06:33:21,540 --> 06:33:22,740
and drink a black coffee?

4779
06:33:24,020 --> 06:33:25,139
Just to even take a bite?

4780
06:33:25,139 --> 06:33:26,659
Just so I can have it on camera

4781
06:33:26,659 --> 06:33:27,619
and know that I did it.

4782
06:33:28,419 --> 06:33:31,180
That'll be the next eating food embarrassing stream.

4783
06:33:31,900 --> 06:33:32,779
We'll see when that happens.

4784
06:33:35,400 --> 06:33:36,439
Jerma lied about Taco Bell.

4785
06:33:36,439 --> 06:33:37,319
Thanks for the $2.50.

4786
06:33:37,319 --> 06:33:38,279
They say Jerma Defoe.

4787
06:33:39,939 --> 06:33:42,700
Jerma Defoe.

4788
06:33:42,700 --> 06:33:45,369
Thank you.

4789
06:33:45,369 --> 06:33:45,849
Do it quick.

4790
06:33:45,849 --> 06:33:46,970
It might be a limited time thing.

4791
06:33:46,970 --> 06:33:47,369
You're right.

4792
06:33:48,090 --> 06:33:48,729
I'll do it soon.

4793
06:33:49,979 --> 06:33:50,700
Oh, Rijian.

4794
06:33:50,700 --> 06:33:51,659
Thanks for the $3.50.

4795
06:33:51,659 --> 06:33:53,500
Jerma, why are you such a psycho

4796
06:33:53,500 --> 06:33:56,459
hurting these innocent kittens and workers?

4797
06:33:56,459 --> 06:33:58,139
How would you like it if I walked into your office

4798
06:33:58,139 --> 06:33:59,500
and stabbed you midstream?

4799
06:34:01,959 --> 06:34:02,520
Here's the thing.

4800
06:34:02,520 --> 06:34:04,599
I don't work in a dungeon.

4801
06:34:05,400 --> 06:34:08,680
With bones everywhere and bodies and urns.

4802
06:34:10,299 --> 06:34:12,060
I haven't eaten three people today.

4803
06:34:15,029 --> 06:34:16,389
Some of the fucking monsters out here

4804
06:34:16,389 --> 06:34:18,790
have eaten people in the last four hours.

4805
06:34:18,790 --> 06:34:19,509
I haven't done that.

4806
06:34:20,229 --> 06:34:26,389
You hear that?

4807
06:34:26,389 --> 06:34:30,869
Hold on.

4808
06:34:30,869 --> 06:34:32,860
Wait, wait, wait.

4809
06:34:32,860 --> 06:34:35,369
Oh, what the hell?

4810
06:34:35,369 --> 06:34:36,330
It was just getting started.

4811
06:34:42,869 --> 06:34:44,229
It's fireworks.

4812
06:34:44,229 --> 06:34:45,430
It's the 4th of July.

4813
06:34:46,709 --> 06:34:48,630
Well, it's the 4th of July eve.

4814
06:34:49,189 --> 06:34:51,029
Don't you guys know that 4th of July

4815
06:34:51,029 --> 06:34:56,470
means a week before and four months after

4816
06:34:56,470 --> 06:34:58,389
people still do fireworks?

4817
06:34:58,389 --> 06:34:59,270
That's how it works.

4818
06:34:59,990 --> 06:35:08,500
But thank you, Rijian, for the $3.50.

4819
06:35:15,159 --> 06:35:17,639
Cyanide Zero gave a ton of subs.

4820
06:35:17,639 --> 06:35:19,159
I think at least 40 or 50 of them

4821
06:35:19,159 --> 06:35:20,040
over the course of the stream.

4822
06:35:20,599 --> 06:35:21,400
Hundreds of dollars.

4823
06:35:21,400 --> 06:35:22,360
Thank you, Cyanide.

4824
06:35:25,099 --> 06:35:26,459
Is Otto okay with fireworks?

4825
06:35:26,459 --> 06:35:27,099
Yeah, he's okay.

4826
06:35:27,900 --> 06:35:29,419
He's not bad with loud noises

4827
06:35:29,419 --> 06:35:31,819
or consistent popping, cracking sounds.

4828
06:35:32,779 --> 06:35:34,380
During thunderstorms, he's fine.

4829
06:35:35,990 --> 06:35:36,389
Hold on.

4830
06:35:36,950 --> 06:35:38,439
Do it again.

4831
06:35:39,000 --> 06:35:40,419
Do it again.

4832
06:35:42,580 --> 06:35:47,209
I actually got fireworks are legal in Nevada.

4833
06:35:47,209 --> 06:35:51,049
So Kim and I have some sparklers

4834
06:35:51,049 --> 06:35:52,490
and some little spinny things.

4835
06:35:52,490 --> 06:35:55,619
And probably going to just play with them.

4836
06:35:55,619 --> 06:36:00,840
That's one thing.

4837
06:36:00,840 --> 06:36:02,919
Fireworks were always illegal in Massachusetts.

4838
06:36:02,919 --> 06:36:03,720
And it was always like,

4839
06:36:03,720 --> 06:36:05,319
oh, look at all these fireworks.

4840
06:36:05,319 --> 06:36:07,159
Oh, we can't really do anything.

4841
06:36:09,099 --> 06:36:12,659
I'm not even sure sparklers are legal

4842
06:36:12,659 --> 06:36:14,580
to buy or own in Massachusetts.

4843
06:36:15,139 --> 06:36:21,830
I don't know why.

4844
06:36:22,389 --> 06:36:27,189
Because I know that there's like three

4845
06:36:27,189 --> 06:36:28,549
different types of fireworks, right?

4846
06:36:28,549 --> 06:36:31,049
There is no fireworks.

4847
06:36:31,049 --> 06:36:31,849
Fireworks are legal.

4848
06:36:32,409 --> 06:36:36,009
There's fireworks that cannot go into the air or explode.

4849
06:36:36,009 --> 06:36:37,450
They call them safe and sane.

4850
06:36:38,090 --> 06:36:40,540
Those are legal in Nevada.

4851
06:36:40,540 --> 06:36:43,900
So you can't know aerials and no explosions.

4852
06:36:44,540 --> 06:36:47,909
Everything else is able to be purchased here.

4853
06:36:47,909 --> 06:36:56,200
That's the same thing in New York.

4854
06:36:56,759 --> 06:37:04,310
Yeah, it's like that everywhere.

4855
06:37:04,310 --> 06:37:05,750
There's only a few states, I think,

4856
06:37:05,750 --> 06:37:07,270
in the United States that even allow

4857
06:37:07,990 --> 06:37:12,150
the purchase and sale of aerial fireworks

4858
06:37:12,150 --> 06:37:14,470
and firecrackers and Roman candles.

4859
06:37:15,669 --> 06:37:16,229
I don't know.

4860
06:37:16,229 --> 06:37:17,029
There's not very many.

4861
06:37:20,229 --> 06:37:22,549
Way more states in the United States

4862
06:37:22,549 --> 06:37:26,709
have sort of put a leash on fireworks.

4863
06:37:32,860 --> 06:37:34,139
But yeah, you'll probably hear it

4864
06:37:34,139 --> 06:37:35,020
a few times in the background.

4865
06:37:35,900 --> 06:37:37,580
Sir Black Mage, thanks for the 250.

4866
06:37:37,580 --> 06:37:38,299
There's a clip here.

4867
06:37:38,299 --> 06:37:39,020
I wonder what it is.

4868
06:37:41,000 --> 06:37:43,240
German admits he is afraid of pinwheel.

4869
06:37:46,409 --> 06:37:47,529
Yeah, I am afraid of pinwheel.

4870
06:37:52,380 --> 06:37:53,340
I did say that.

4871
06:37:54,439 --> 06:37:56,360
But you have to give me the context of

4872
06:37:56,919 --> 06:37:58,520
I'm afraid of 100 pinwheels.

4873
06:37:59,159 --> 06:38:01,959
Are you afraid of one Nito-sized pinwheel

4874
06:38:01,959 --> 06:38:04,919
or 100 duck-sized pinwheels?

4875
06:38:04,919 --> 06:38:06,279
Whatever the thing is that people say.

4876
06:38:07,240 --> 06:38:07,880
It doesn't matter.

4877
06:38:14,279 --> 06:38:18,279
Thank you to Sir Canine for the five dollars.

4878
06:38:18,279 --> 06:38:19,159
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

4879
06:38:19,159 --> 06:38:21,319
Welcome to episode one of Dark Souls Randomizer,

4880
06:38:21,319 --> 06:38:23,000
the series where I play Dark Souls.

4881
06:38:23,000 --> 06:38:25,000
This is going to be a single-player let's play.

4882
06:38:25,000 --> 06:38:25,880
And when I say let's play,

4883
06:38:25,880 --> 06:38:27,080
I use that term pretty loosely

4884
06:38:27,080 --> 06:38:28,919
because I am an idiot in this game.

4885
06:38:28,919 --> 06:38:30,200
You're going to see lots of fails.

4886
06:38:30,200 --> 06:38:31,400
You're going to see lots of cheating,

4887
06:38:31,959 --> 06:38:33,240
at least I'm hoping.

4888
06:38:33,240 --> 06:38:35,159
So grab yourself a nice cup of coffee,

4889
06:38:35,159 --> 06:38:36,599
a nice hot cup of cocoa.

4890
06:38:36,599 --> 06:38:38,360
I got apple cider here, freshly brewed.

4891
06:38:38,360 --> 06:38:39,319
Let me just take a sip.

4892
06:38:39,880 --> 06:38:40,919
Oh, that's some...

4893
06:38:40,919 --> 06:38:42,040
And then they ran out of space.

4894
06:38:44,090 --> 06:38:47,049
Thank you Kermit the Frugue for the three dollars.

4895
06:38:47,049 --> 06:38:48,169
Love you and your streams, Jerma.

4896
06:38:48,169 --> 06:38:49,930
If you're ever in the mood for more JermaCraft,

4897
06:38:51,130 --> 06:38:51,529
call me.

4898
06:38:51,529 --> 06:38:54,009
Carson said he would love for you to join

4899
06:38:54,810 --> 06:38:58,490
SMP Live, his big Minecraft server for streamers.

4900
06:38:59,290 --> 06:39:01,319
People do there.

4901
06:39:01,880 --> 06:39:07,159
Please Tim, but they have Shpleef.

4902
06:39:08,939 --> 06:39:09,740
Do they have Shpleef?

4903
06:39:10,380 --> 06:39:14,169
That's all I care about.

4904
06:39:19,290 --> 06:39:20,009
Yes, they do.

4905
06:39:22,090 --> 06:39:23,049
Thank you for the three bucks.

4906
06:39:23,049 --> 06:39:25,689
And maybe if I ever get the urge to play Minecraft,

4907
06:39:25,689 --> 06:39:26,970
I'll hit some people up.

4908
06:39:26,970 --> 06:39:27,369
We'll see.

4909
06:39:28,569 --> 06:39:29,529
Thank you for the three dollars.

4910
06:39:30,729 --> 06:39:32,090
Smelly boy, thanks for the 250.

4911
06:39:32,090 --> 06:39:34,009
I honestly cannot believe you allowed yourself

4912
06:39:34,009 --> 06:39:35,529
to be killed by Pinwheel again.

4913
06:39:38,119 --> 06:39:39,400
This time it was on camera.

4914
06:39:40,299 --> 06:39:43,500
Actually recorded broadcast live on this website.

4915
06:39:45,860 --> 06:39:47,299
Tar Alecran, thanks for the five dollars.

4916
06:39:47,299 --> 06:39:48,900
I think it's pretty obvious after watching you tonight

4917
06:39:48,900 --> 06:39:51,060
that you've never actually played this game.

4918
06:39:51,060 --> 06:39:52,740
And at the time you beat this game on stream

4919
06:39:52,740 --> 06:39:54,099
was actually just pre-recorded footage

4920
06:39:54,099 --> 06:39:55,700
with gameplay by a different streamer.

4921
06:39:58,139 --> 06:39:59,259
I mean it was a different,

4922
06:39:59,900 --> 06:40:01,259
I mean it was a different streamer.

4923
06:40:02,139 --> 06:40:03,659
It was me and a different day.

4924
06:40:05,240 --> 06:40:06,599
So it was a different me.

4925
06:40:07,930 --> 06:40:09,610
Every day when you wake up, it's a new you.

4926
06:40:10,979 --> 06:40:11,860
When you go to sleep,

4927
06:40:12,979 --> 06:40:14,979
you wake up as a new person, like in your brain.

4928
06:40:18,090 --> 06:40:24,259
Every day you get up, you're a new person.

4929
06:40:24,259 --> 06:40:26,020
I think you can get banned, of course.

4930
06:40:26,020 --> 06:40:26,979
I'm not going to say that.

4931
06:40:28,340 --> 06:40:29,860
But thank you Tar Alecran.

4932
06:40:29,860 --> 06:40:32,419
I beat Dark Souls Remastered on stream

4933
06:40:32,419 --> 06:40:34,180
and most recently beat Sekiro on stream

4934
06:40:34,180 --> 06:40:36,259
and also finished The Last Boss, The True Last Boss.

4935
06:40:36,900 --> 06:40:38,740
I know a lot of other YouTubers and streamers

4936
06:40:38,740 --> 06:40:41,860
that you may have come across gave up or said,

4937
06:40:41,860 --> 06:40:43,380
nah, this is too much.

4938
06:40:43,380 --> 06:40:46,580
Or they did it like two, three hundred tries.

4939
06:40:46,580 --> 06:40:47,540
I did it in 52.

4940
06:40:48,099 --> 06:40:49,380
I think that gives me a little bit of a right

4941
06:40:49,380 --> 06:40:53,619
to say these things and play Randomizer

4942
06:40:53,619 --> 06:40:55,060
and follow a couple of clips.

4943
06:40:55,700 --> 06:40:56,900
I think I get the pass there.

4944
06:41:08,150 --> 06:41:10,150
I missed Jerma from last Tuesday.

4945
06:41:10,950 --> 06:41:11,509
Where's that?

4946
06:41:11,509 --> 06:41:12,310
Where's that guy?

4947
06:41:13,509 --> 06:41:16,869
But thank you Tar Alecran for the five dollars.

4948
06:41:16,869 --> 06:41:17,430
Appreciate it.

4949
06:41:18,150 --> 06:41:18,950
Man up.

4950
06:41:19,669 --> 06:41:21,430
Thank you, man up for the 250.

4951
06:41:21,430 --> 06:41:22,630
Have a McDouble on me.

4952
06:41:24,020 --> 06:41:25,060
Not tonight, but I will.

4953
06:41:25,619 --> 06:41:26,099
Eventually.

4954
06:41:27,049 --> 06:41:27,529
Thank you.

4955
06:41:28,169 --> 06:41:29,849
That was man up with Icy Hot.

4956
06:41:31,180 --> 06:41:32,619
Bake me home thanks for the 250.

4957
06:41:33,259 --> 06:41:36,340
Sir, no, it's the same one.

4958
06:41:36,340 --> 06:41:38,020
Bake me home thanks for the 250.

4959
06:41:38,020 --> 06:41:39,860
The fax machine thanks for the 10 bucks.

4960
06:41:42,009 --> 06:41:44,330
Scrambled eggs are the best with the shell.

4961
06:41:45,049 --> 06:41:49,849
I mean, you have there's a kappa here before this.

4962
06:41:51,240 --> 06:41:53,159
Scrambled eggs are best with the shell.

4963
06:41:54,180 --> 06:41:56,180
That means it's a joke and it's not real.

4964
06:41:59,779 --> 06:42:00,659
Can you eat?

4965
06:42:00,659 --> 06:42:02,180
You can eat eggshells, can't you?

4966
06:42:12,060 --> 06:42:13,740
You're not like supposed to, but I think you can.

4967
06:42:14,860 --> 06:42:20,979
Hard boiled.

4968
06:42:22,919 --> 06:42:24,360
You can eat gravel too.

4969
06:42:24,360 --> 06:42:25,560
Yeah, but I mean, you can act.

4970
06:42:31,799 --> 06:42:33,529
Yeah, yep.

4971
06:42:35,349 --> 06:42:36,630
But thank you for the 10 dollars.

4972
06:42:36,630 --> 06:42:37,349
That's a lot of money.

4973
06:42:37,349 --> 06:42:37,669
Thank you.

4974
06:42:38,389 --> 06:42:39,270
The fax machine.

4975
06:42:41,450 --> 06:42:43,610
Let's get the credits rolling here.

4976
06:42:44,409 --> 06:42:45,770
There was shitload of community subs.

4977
06:42:47,180 --> 06:42:47,819
Throw them up.

4978
06:42:51,860 --> 06:42:52,580
Thank you everybody.

4979
06:42:53,459 --> 06:43:00,860
If you're a sub to this channel, or if you're not, either one.

4980
06:43:01,419 --> 06:43:05,270
Here are tonight's subs and resubs.

4981
06:43:05,830 --> 06:43:10,470
Much love to you.

4982
06:43:10,470 --> 06:43:13,270
Thank you for your continued support of this live stream.

4983
06:43:17,319 --> 06:43:19,799
If you play SMP live, you will be famous.

4984
06:43:20,599 --> 06:43:29,220
But then I'll be Minecraft famous.

4985
06:43:29,779 --> 06:43:33,099
Is that something I necessarily want?

4986
06:43:38,540 --> 06:43:40,220
That's the best kind of famous.

4987
06:43:40,459 --> 06:43:41,740
Is Minecraft famous?

4988
06:43:47,430 --> 06:43:49,270
You already are Minecraft famous.

4989
06:43:49,270 --> 06:43:51,189
I am not Minecraft famous.

4990
06:43:52,069 --> 06:43:53,990
Speaking of Minecraft, thanks for the sub, Minecraft.

4991
06:43:53,990 --> 06:43:54,549
Appreciate it.

4992
06:43:55,830 --> 06:43:56,790
How would I beat that?

4993
06:43:58,599 --> 06:44:04,040
I made 11 videos on Minecraft and they got like fucking 8,000 views each.

4994
06:44:13,299 --> 06:44:14,979
JermaCraft is how I found you.

4995
06:44:19,220 --> 06:44:24,889
Anyways, thank you to BakeMeHomeForThe250.

4996
06:44:24,889 --> 06:44:27,529
I think we got it already, but it popped up here again.

4997
06:44:27,529 --> 06:44:29,049
Trampston, thanks for five dollars.

4998
06:44:30,009 --> 06:44:32,330
McChicken part two, McChicken part two.

4999
06:44:33,290 --> 06:44:37,369
I'm not going to eat McChickens on stream every night.

5000
06:44:37,369 --> 06:44:39,049
That's not going to be a thing I'm going to do.

5001
06:44:39,770 --> 06:44:45,380
I mean, that's a pretty hilariously stupid thing to do at the end of your streams.

5002
06:44:46,340 --> 06:44:47,939
You're just the McChicken guy?

5003
06:44:49,740 --> 06:44:51,419
That's your live stream schtick?

5004
06:44:54,569 --> 06:44:56,729
I would start to feel bad every day.

5005
06:44:57,529 --> 06:45:03,430
People get hyped in the chat over it,

5006
06:45:03,430 --> 06:45:05,909
and people get really excited for the McChicken portion.

5007
06:45:06,630 --> 06:45:08,229
All right guys, here it comes.

5008
06:45:08,790 --> 06:45:10,549
I got two McChickens tonight.

5009
06:45:11,189 --> 06:45:13,450
Here's the McChicken portion of the stream.

5010
06:45:14,169 --> 06:45:24,340
Two?

5011
06:45:24,340 --> 06:45:26,259
Yeah, you don't just eat one McChicken.

5012
06:45:26,900 --> 06:45:35,779
You can't go to McDonald's and just get a double cheeseburger meal.

5013
06:45:35,779 --> 06:45:43,400
No, you get a double cheeseburger meal, two McChickens, a large fry, and an apple pie.

5014
06:45:45,459 --> 06:45:47,860
You don't just, oh yeah, I'll take a Big Mac meal and that's it.

5015
06:45:47,860 --> 06:45:48,659
No, no, no, no, no.

5016
06:45:48,659 --> 06:45:52,250
I'll take a Big Mac meal and a 10-piece nugget.

5017
06:45:55,080 --> 06:46:03,669
You don't just order one thing off that menu, ever, because you know it's not enough.

5018
06:46:05,509 --> 06:46:07,990
You know it's too much, but you also know it's not enough.

5019
06:46:08,630 --> 06:46:20,139
But we have a couple more here.

5020
06:46:20,139 --> 06:46:24,220
We have SirK9 for $2.50, all these bits, and still in Anor Londo.

5021
06:46:24,860 --> 06:46:26,729
Omega Low.

5022
06:46:26,729 --> 06:46:29,319
Omega Low, the big one.

5023
06:46:30,220 --> 06:46:31,900
Man up with Icy Hot, thanks for the $2.50.

5024
06:46:31,900 --> 06:46:34,380
I had no idea that eating burgers was a German meme now,

5025
06:46:34,380 --> 06:46:39,459
but you should buy a second McDouble on me, for plus two's sake.

5026
06:46:40,020 --> 06:46:48,470
I'm not, I gave McDonald's a two out of five last night.

5027
06:46:49,110 --> 06:46:51,270
You think I'm gonna be the McDonald's guy?

5028
06:46:51,270 --> 06:46:52,549
I told you it was gross.

5029
06:46:54,040 --> 06:46:55,479
At least three or four times.

5030
06:46:56,119 --> 06:47:02,580
2.8, 2.8 is not free, and 2.8 is not a good score.

5031
06:47:02,580 --> 06:47:03,779
That's still under 500.

5032
06:47:04,580 --> 06:47:06,340
Well, it's just not, it's just over 500.

5033
06:47:06,900 --> 06:47:07,779
That's not very good.

5034
06:47:08,419 --> 06:47:11,990
That's like getting a 58 on your math test.

5035
06:47:11,990 --> 06:47:12,630
That's not good.

5036
06:47:17,590 --> 06:47:18,389
That's still an F.

5037
06:47:18,950 --> 06:47:28,840
That's good for me.

5038
06:47:29,479 --> 06:47:32,729
Clueless Sniper, thanks for the $2.50.

5039
06:47:33,450 --> 06:47:34,439
Right at the end.

5040
06:47:35,159 --> 06:47:37,319
And thanks everybody for watching.

5041
06:47:37,959 --> 06:47:43,270
These last couple of streams have been kind of insanity.

5042
06:47:44,540 --> 06:47:47,180
So we're probably gonna dial it back a little

5043
06:47:47,180 --> 06:47:50,060
and relax on the stream on Friday or Saturday.

5044
06:47:50,860 --> 06:47:52,540
I have a couple things that I could do.

5045
06:47:56,540 --> 06:47:57,659
Hopefully you have enjoyed them.

5046
06:47:58,220 --> 06:48:00,490
I've had a lot of fun in these last couple of streams,

5047
06:48:00,490 --> 06:48:02,409
even though they were a lightning rod,

5048
06:48:03,130 --> 06:48:05,049
like times 10 energy streams.

5049
06:48:05,930 --> 06:48:06,810
They've still a lot of fun.

5050
06:48:08,919 --> 06:48:11,319
But happy 4th of July to everybody that celebrates it.

5051
06:48:12,409 --> 06:48:14,650
I'll be back in a couple of days.

5052
06:48:15,529 --> 06:48:19,259
Keep an eye on the sus as of tomorrow night

5053
06:48:19,259 --> 06:48:20,540
and you'll have a really good indication

5054
06:48:20,540 --> 06:48:21,659
of what the next stream will be.

5055
06:48:23,020 --> 06:48:23,500
Take care.

5056
06:48:24,299 --> 06:48:25,020
Much love to you.

5057
06:48:25,740 --> 06:48:27,209
See you really soon.

5058
06:48:28,090 --> 06:48:29,209
Take care, guys.
