1
00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:05,700
Okay, so I have a couple of options here that I think we could pivot to that would be fun.

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:13,619
I don't know which one to do because there's very real possibility that one of the two of these

3
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:18,660
things that I want to just throw in here are going to be so bad. I'm not sure which one.

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,660
I have Universal Studios Ride the Rides for GameCube. I don't know why I bought it,

5
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:36,500
I don't even know how I bought this. Or another Cooking Mama game that was on the Wii,

6
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:41,460
the Cooking Mama 2 for the Wii, and then go to Animal Crossing in like another couple hours.

7
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:47,659
I'm not sure which one of those I want to do right now, but they both sound very interesting to me.

8
00:00:50,070 --> 00:01:01,140
Should we ride the rides at Universal? Universal Studios? Look, this just got caught in the wind

9
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,810
here. I'm just looking up GameCube games that look like they could be fun and interesting,

10
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:11,530
and I'm like, when am I going to have an opportunity to play this fucking game? Ever.

11
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:16,180
Because this game, this is a game that I will never play for more than an hour or two,

12
00:01:18,459 --> 00:01:32,629
so it seems like a pretty good spot for it right now. And look, if this game is absolute dog shit,

13
00:01:32,629 --> 00:01:37,140
then we can just keep moving around. I'm open today, I'm open to whatever,

14
00:01:38,709 --> 00:01:42,790
but this is already set up so it's going to have to be something for the GameCube or the Wii.

15
00:01:44,019 --> 00:01:54,969
We want to go on rides? Okay, let's go on some rides. We might have to do some changing of the

16
00:01:54,969 --> 00:02:14,039
audio. Let's see. Do we have to do any changing of the audio? This game is not a true representation

17
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:21,689
of Universal Studios theme parks. What? I missed, oh, I missed 50 dollar bits, holy shit. 5,000 bits

18
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:28,840
from Phylacter Lich, that's 50 more bucks. Please play Gotcha Force, you sexy BLT clown. Gotcha

19
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,449
Force is probably going to be like a 10 hour stream, and that was not on the plans for today.

20
00:02:33,449 --> 00:02:55,099
This is going to take too long. Oh, there he is! Wait, why is he in there? Why is he in there?

21
00:02:55,659 --> 00:03:01,750
Are we going to get a, please be the person that takes us around the whole park.

22
00:03:02,469 --> 00:03:23,479
There's no dialogue. Are you guys ready to ride these rides? This game is going to be very bad,

23
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:37,289
I can already tell. You know, in hindsight, I'd like to uncheck the box when this is in my cart

24
00:03:37,849 --> 00:03:49,530
to remove it from my cart, but I can't do that. All right, you ready to test the audio? We're

25
00:03:49,530 --> 00:04:05,750
going to do some audio testing here. Ready? Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Oh, shit. Boom. It's all right.

26
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:18,519
Just skip and play Cooking. How is this game hard? Rumble feature. I don't know, I hate Rumble.

27
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:39,029
Universal Studios theme park adventure. Name, what's your name? That doesn't matter. Me. I don't

28
00:04:39,029 --> 00:05:05,019
care. It doesn't matter. Jeremy. Player select. No. Oh, there, there. Oh, please do it. Please.

29
00:05:05,019 --> 00:05:09,660
That's all I care about. It'll be worth the like 80 cent purchase if we get like a

30
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:33,420
uh

31
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:42,329
Welcome to Universal Studios. I'm Woody Woodpecker. And today at Universal Studios,

32
00:05:42,329 --> 00:05:49,350
we have exciting theme areas based on the movie world. Today in the marketing of stamp collection

33
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:57,529
contest. That's not Woody Woodpecker. This is not how Woody Woodpecker sounds. Let's begin.

34
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:09,579
Get lost. Do it. Holy shit. They couldn't even get somebody to do it. They couldn't get somebody

35
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:17,370
to go to do the it is it's it's about put those kids to sleep. Well, yeah, I can do this on this

36
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:21,449
thing. It's gonna take some thinking. You can do this on my sound machine right now.

37
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:59,689
All right, let's go. I can't wait. I can't wait. I can't wait. I can't wait. I can't wait. I can't

38
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:07,509
wait. I can't wait. Come on. Come on. Come on. I want to get to the right. I want to get to

39
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:25,110
Space Mountain. How do I do anything? Oh, all right. That's not real. This is the kind of costume

40
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:34,360
man. Can I talk to people? Stamps are either red or blue. You'll earn a red stamp if you score high

41
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,949
in an attraction.

42
00:08:00,089 --> 00:08:06,250
Motion picture magic. No, I don't want to watch a movie. I want to ride. The game is very loud.

43
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:11,930
Is that better? Oh, no, I'm quiet. That was my fault.

44
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:32,009
ET. Give me on ET. What's up, you fucking creep? Yes.

45
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:28,600
I didn't get any of that. I don't know how this works. I don't know how to play the game. All I

46
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:34,679
heard was everybody sticking a needle into my ear and hitting like the fucking right side of my

47
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:43,159
brain. Wait, I actually have to do... This is not how the ride works. I thought I was just going to

48
00:09:43,159 --> 00:10:02,070
ride the ride. Wait, it like put me in ET the movie. Go. All right, can I stop bunny hopping

49
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:23,059
and go for these speed bumps? All right, to be fair, I do that. I used to do that shit all the

50
00:10:23,059 --> 00:10:36,169
time on my bike, even when I wasn't rushing to deliver an alien through his spaceship. God,

51
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:51,700
this ride sucks. This is really... What a shitty ride. Hey, kid, just go ride down the street.

52
00:10:53,129 --> 00:11:07,860
You have four minutes to ride a regular bike down the street. Cool. I left three and a half

53
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:21,259
minutes to get there. How do I speed up? At what point is there adult intervention?

54
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:47,690
He keeps falling down. But now they're trying to kill him. Crunchy. This is fucking terrible.

55
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:51,370
But I need to... Hold on. We're getting into the hard part.

56
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:59,100
Holy shit. They're dropping... They're doing like Bowser, every Bowser boss fight.

57
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:13,139
All again, Jeremy. It's funny. I'm just pedaling, dude. I'm going to get there.

58
00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:18,169
By the way, somebody said they guarantee I don't... They guaranteed I don't beat the first

59
00:12:18,169 --> 00:12:22,009
level. Somebody said that. I want to make sure that that's on the line now.

60
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:52,860
He actually did it. Yeah. We're almost at the end. I have two minutes to get like 15 feet.

61
00:12:53,500 --> 00:13:01,100
It's not over yet. I know. I can see. This is a loading screen. Yeah, it was a loading screen.

62
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:17,370
Did it go over this? Oh, okay. I will tell you. I promise. If the next level is this exact same

63
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:24,409
level, this exact same game with a different coat of paint on it. It's a side scrolling racer with

64
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:32,009
a goal at the end. If that's the next game, I will take the discount immediately and I will throw it

65
00:13:32,009 --> 00:13:50,299
away. Okay? I promise. I will recycle. I will recycle this, if that's the case. Eat the disc.

66
00:13:50,299 --> 00:14:05,240
No. All right. How did it end? Is this a ride or is this a really, really, really rich kid's

67
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:20,360
expensive birthday party? This is all for me. Holy fuck, man. It took some of you motherfuckers

68
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:35,940
an hour to do this. 59 minutes. That's impossible. That's not even possible.

69
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:44,250
Some. All, actually. All. Did I get a stamp? Oh, we can do a quiz. All right. I got the E.T.

70
00:14:44,250 --> 00:15:04,389
stamp. All right. I'm not done. Is there a map? Map. Where's map? Item. Is there a map? Can I go

71
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:11,320
in the mailbox? Go to Jurassic Park? I mean, I have no idea where to even go. I'm like a lost kid.

72
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:24,440
Most in picture. Magic. What's this thing? Can I do this one? Press tab, noob. There's no tab on a

73
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:32,870
GameCube. Wait, somebody wanted to talk to me. What do you want? Someone was handing out maps

74
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:46,649
at the park entrance. I mean, he looked. Looked at what? All right. There's the park entrance

75
00:15:46,649 --> 00:15:53,929
right here. Where are the maps? Map. Do you have a cap? You can enter some attractions whenever you

76
00:15:54,009 --> 00:16:12,470
want if you have a cap. This music not like this. All right. Give me a map. Hello. There are letter

77
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:16,789
tiles hidden inside the park. You'll receive a stamp if you collect all the tiles. You'll earn

78
00:16:16,789 --> 00:16:25,129
points if you click. Uh-huh. All right. Woody, give me a map. Right now, every attraction is at

79
00:16:25,129 --> 00:16:30,970
full capacity and nobody can get in. I'll give you this. E-pass. You can only have one E-pass,

80
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:35,690
but you have priority to enter any attraction that you want. So if you decide to use your E-pass,

81
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:47,210
choose the attraction wisely. What? I have to use an express pass? I want to exchange my points.

82
00:16:52,710 --> 00:17:04,579
ET cap. T-Rex shoes. No, no. No, no, no. I want to come back. This is just animal crossing, yeah?

83
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:11,859
Where's the entrance to this park that somebody has a map for me? Over 40,000 points.

84
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:23,349
Get the fuck out of here. Unlock everything. I'm not gonna do that. Where do I get this map?

85
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:27,750
I heard somebody was handing out maps at the entrance. Well, where the hell are they?

86
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:42,099
Is there a sprint? Can I go right? No. I'm just gonna keep following the road. What's the,

87
00:17:42,099 --> 00:17:46,490
what's the worst that could happen? Right? What do you mean? There? There? Right there? Where?

88
00:17:47,289 --> 00:17:57,799
Who has a map? Nobody has a map. Who's going down the road? You're gonna get hit by a truck.

89
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:06,940
Do you have a map? No. Okay. I don't have a map. If you don't have a map, get one back at the park

90
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:58,089
entrance. The red lady? Nobody has a map. There's no, this lady? This lady didn't, hey, hello.

91
00:18:58,089 --> 00:19:06,069
Nobody has a map, guys. Nobody has a fucking map. Red lady. This is a blast. I'm having so much fun.

92
00:19:07,829 --> 00:19:12,490
I need an, I need an adult to help me do this. Where's there? I'm at the park. This is the park

93
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:19,849
entrance right now. Red. Do you know where you're going next? I don't know. I don't know where to go.

94
00:19:21,849 --> 00:19:28,730
Help. Which attraction should I go see now? I don't know. I need help. I'm lost. Wait. I can go down

95
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:52,819
here. Wait. Just get this shit out of me. Map. All right. This is the park entrance. I'm supposed

96
00:19:52,819 --> 00:20:04,220
to go into the fucking parking lot. Where is the map person? I'm in the parking lot. Do you have

97
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:14,019
maps? The weather is always nice. Don't leave. I'm not gonna just leave. You think this kid has

98
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:19,460
enough to like survive walking down? No, he's got like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and

99
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:30,569
like Ritz crackers in his backpack. I'm not, Lee, I'm not going anywhere. This map doesn't

100
00:20:30,569 --> 00:20:41,220
fucking exist. It doesn't. I just have to walk to the next ride. I'll just walk into the next ride.

101
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:46,359
I don't even care what it is. Do you have a Ritz sponsorship? No, but they're fucking utterly

102
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:53,099
delicious. When you put a Ritz cracker in your mouth, you can eat them by themselves. Wait,

103
00:20:53,099 --> 00:21:07,849
you mean blind again? The guy in blue. What? Here, have a map. All right. We're going to,

104
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:15,880
we're going, here we go. When you put a Ritz cracker in your mouth, this shit disintegrates.

105
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:21,640
It's so buttery and flavorful and it just disintegrates in your mouth. You put a little,

106
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:27,160
one little like cube of cheese on it. You put a little piece of salami on it. Ritz crackers

107
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:31,799
are seriously some of the best snack you could ever have. You can eat them by themselves.

108
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:37,799
They're fulfilling. They're, they're, they're satisfying. I, I fully endorse Ritz crackers

109
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:48,579
for a snack president, I guess. All right. Where am I going? All right. Let's go this way.

110
00:21:56,339 --> 00:22:15,660
I got it. I L. Oh, what's that up there? New ride. It's not even a ride. It's not even a ride.

111
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:34,259
Got it. Can I find something? Please? I think I found something. Jaws. All right. Let's get on

112
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:45,420
Jaws. You can't enter this attraction because there are too many people. Wait, you have an E

113
00:22:45,420 --> 00:23:10,809
pass. Let me know whenever you want to try this attraction. Just wait in line. I can go once.

114
00:23:11,529 --> 00:23:18,019
All right. Let's fucking go. A Jaws. This is going to be the coolest one. Let's go. I'm going to

115
00:23:18,019 --> 00:24:06,710
Jaws. I'm freaking me the fuck out. I don't, I don't even know how to play. I have no fucking idea.

116
00:24:08,339 --> 00:24:16,680
A and B. Wait, I'm Jaws. All right. Let's go pick up barrel and throw barrel at Jaws.

117
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:55,509
Hurry up. Get out of here. Oh shit. He took a bite. Uh, starboard, right? Get up, get up, get up,

118
00:24:55,509 --> 00:25:03,029
get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up. Oh my God. He's

119
00:25:03,029 --> 00:25:25,400
going to eat me. Oh shit. A kid fell down off the jaws where I turned it off. This is not even

120
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:34,569
hitting him. How do I open shit? Can I open these boxes? He's wrecking the boat. Yeah. I mean,

121
00:25:34,569 --> 00:26:00,779
I have to hit him with these things, but he keeps. It was so dumb. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come

122
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:15,990
on. Do it again. Here we go. I'm running out of Donkey Kong barrels to throw at this guy.

123
00:26:31,609 --> 00:26:54,940
Are the yellow ones worth more damage or something? Imagine paying like $150 million to license all

124
00:26:54,940 --> 00:27:13,609
the shit in this game and you throw boxes at Jaws off the boat. I have 30 seconds to continue.

125
00:27:14,329 --> 00:27:31,880
Wait, which one's selected? All right. Here we go. I'll get it. Now I understand the mechanics.

126
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:47,980
Well, I didn't know if it was like, it was like depressed or not. Please no more. No, no, no. I'm

127
00:27:47,980 --> 00:28:07,289
not done. I'm not done. I'm not done. Please no more. That zoom in on his face. That perfect

128
00:28:07,369 --> 00:28:19,779
zoom in with the thing in the fucking head. Oh, throw it. Look at Jaws in the top left.

129
00:28:20,339 --> 00:29:35,099
Fuck out of here. Jaws. Please no more. Don't fall kid. It's only one guy saying no more. All

130
00:29:35,099 --> 00:29:49,769
right. All right. All right. Okay. All right. That's fine. It's so dumb. It's so dumb. It's so dumb.

131
00:29:50,650 --> 00:30:18,730
Only one guy said only one guy was saying no more. Wait, what? Only one guy was saying

132
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:26,890
only one guy was saying no more. You're going through too many layers of one guy. I can't,

133
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:41,019
I can't follow you that well. All right. I think I only have to do one more. There's only one spot?

134
00:30:41,019 --> 00:30:57,509
No, there's like four. Let's go. What's he doing? He's circling the boat. Let's go, man.

135
00:30:57,509 --> 00:31:19,180
Oh, oh, because he's, oh, yeah. Okay. Yes. Yes. I see what you're saying because there's only

136
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:26,220
one green spot left on the boat. The game is so stupid and it has to be here. Get boxed, motherfucker.

137
00:31:27,660 --> 00:32:08,549
He just leaves. Yeah, you're done. Yeah, you're done. Got the stamp. Good job. Is that loud?

138
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:14,980
Wait, that was, oh my God, that is very loud. Oh my God. I'm so sorry. I didn't know. I didn't

139
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:20,630
realize I was going to be that loud. I just, I'm sorry. I'm actually very, very sorry about that.

140
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:25,109
I did not know that was going to be that crunchy and that extreme. Sorry about that. I really am.

141
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:39,829
I didn't mean to do that. My neck. Hello, guys. This game is giving me a stiff neck.

142
00:32:46,140 --> 00:33:01,079
My hands are a little sore. That feels a little better. We have $50 coming. We had

143
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:10,009
a 50, a 50, 50, 50, 50. 5,000 bits from Goiki. Seriously, thanks for the 5,000 bits. Thanks for

144
00:33:10,009 --> 00:33:14,569
the $50, Goiki. This game is fun in a stupid way, but it reminds me of the countless nightmares I've

145
00:33:14,569 --> 00:33:21,660
had about falling into the Jaws ride and it being a real shark. I remember, here's a quick story

146
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:25,900
for you. I remember being really, really scared of the Jaws ride when I was like 10 or 11 years

147
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:31,819
old or something like that when I went to Universal. And I was, I hyped myself up so much

148
00:33:31,819 --> 00:33:37,099
and I was so terrified of it that when I actually got on the ride, I kind of closed my eyes for the

149
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:43,019
almost the entire duration of the ride. But I heard my brother laughing and he thought it was

150
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:47,579
really funny and I didn't understand why he was laughing so hard. And he like kind of was like,

151
00:33:47,579 --> 00:33:58,460
open your eyes, open your eyes. And the Jaws animatronic is so old. It was so old and so shitty.

152
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:07,059
It was just like a sock puppet going like this. And then it would turn and go like,

153
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:15,380
it was not scary at all. It was a, it was, the thing was on fucking strings at that. It was like

154
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:23,130
the thing was built like in the fucking 70s. It didn't even look like a shark and it's gone now.

155
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:28,309
Yeah, unfortunately. So I remember that. Me and my brother just were laughing. We were like laughing

156
00:34:28,309 --> 00:34:35,449
and fucking high-fiving each other and shit. But I will tell you that the Alien ride at Disney World,

157
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:38,889
I did not fuck around on that one. There was a ride at Disney World, and I'm not sure if it's

158
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:43,769
still there, it was at Epcot. It was something, it was like escape, alien escape, whatever it was

159
00:34:43,769 --> 00:34:48,409
called. This is back before they rebranded it. They made it a men in black ride. But before it

160
00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:53,769
was a men in black ride, it was just like an alien escapes from a fucking tube, the ride.

161
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:58,889
And I remember doing this. So I heard how scary it was. There's an alien in the fucking tube and

162
00:34:58,889 --> 00:35:04,090
it breaks out, right? And the whole, the lights go dark. There's like scientists all screaming,

163
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:07,929
like he's out, he got out, run. And they have these weird sensory things where it breeze on

164
00:35:07,929 --> 00:35:11,530
your neck and shit. I remember going like this. Well, here's a strategy. If you're ever scared

165
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:14,809
and you don't want to fucking see anything that's going on on the ride, here's a strat.

166
00:35:14,809 --> 00:35:18,809
It's the pinky and the thumb, pinky and the thumb, pinky on the eyes. Make sure your eyes

167
00:35:18,809 --> 00:35:28,099
are tight and closed. Thumb in the ears. And you won't, there's no sensations. So absolutely.

168
00:35:28,099 --> 00:35:33,860
And in here, I didn't see anything. It's a foolproof tactic. Boom, boom. Like this.

169
00:35:34,579 --> 00:35:41,820
Because everyone goes, Oh no, no, no. Nope. You got the pinky and the thumb technique.

170
00:35:42,619 --> 00:35:47,219
And I did that the whole ride and I did, I didn't even see it. I got out of there.

171
00:35:47,219 --> 00:36:05,579
Professional coward, professional coward. I was, I was like eight. You guys act like I was there.

172
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:14,070
I was there like a couple of months ago being like a scary alien. No, I was like eight or

173
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:18,309
nine years old. I was like fucking 30. Although I probably still would use that technique.

174
00:36:19,429 --> 00:36:27,159
Oh, this is the wild West world. Why are you giving us tips? I'm telling you,

175
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:33,699
okay. It's not even nine year olds that you had. No, you know what? I'm getting really into it.

176
00:36:33,699 --> 00:36:40,219
I go like this with my hand like that. All right. I got it. Let's play. If you have like a little

177
00:36:40,219 --> 00:36:46,860
brother or I don't know, like, I don't know. I skipped this line. You can't get in here because

178
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:59,099
there are too many people. How are you supposed to ride? Ride? Do I have to buy? So you tell me I

179
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:04,039
have to buy. People should throw garbage in the garbage cans. It's pure common sense.

180
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:13,820
Do the quiz. Well, I don't know what the quiz is. I have to go get a pass. Get another E pass.

181
00:37:18,019 --> 00:37:22,579
Why would you gate this game behind fucking E passes? I picked up trash.

182
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:33,780
You have to deposit the trash into the trash receptacle. Oh, nice. Do you know where you're

183
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:41,719
going next? No idea. So I'm going to go buy. How many points do I have? So I'm going to go buy

184
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:46,360
another E pass and then we're going to go do the quiz and then I'm never going to open this game

185
00:37:46,360 --> 00:38:00,840
ever again. Why is a kid picking up trash? You shouldn't be doing this. Oh, I got another stamp.

186
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:12,920
Go on Jurassic Park. It's going to be tough. You hear that? There's a big crunch up here.

187
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:28,519
Jurassic Park is good. Jurassic art. Omega lull. All right. Do I really need a pass to do this?

188
00:38:30,219 --> 00:38:40,519
Why do I have to? That's stupid. Can I just buy it from Woody Woodpecker? Do I have to actually

189
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:44,519
go to the very beginning? I don't have to go to the very beginning of the entrance, do I?

190
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:53,159
Oh, why? You can't get in here because there are too many people. Okay, so why? I would like to

191
00:38:53,159 --> 00:39:03,909
purchase a pass from you. Just go in. Just fucking just go in. Just go in. I have to go all the way

192
00:39:03,909 --> 00:39:22,730
to the beginning of the entrance. This is so... There are two hour waits in most theme parks.

193
00:39:25,659 --> 00:39:38,840
Not if you do the easy pass. Not if you do the easy pass. The E pass. Go get the Jurassic

194
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:49,159
Park hat. I need a pass first. You missed bits, coward. I did actually, right? That was from

195
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:57,780
another more fucking huge money drop. 5,000 bits from Yes Is Online. Another 50 bucks.

196
00:39:58,739 --> 00:40:02,579
Thank you for your insane contribution. Remember, that was part of the great movie

197
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:06,739
ride. It was a compilation of movies with actors and animatronics. They tore it down.

198
00:40:08,409 --> 00:40:16,710
PepeHands. They did a lot of... They changed a lot of shit, didn't they?

199
00:40:19,159 --> 00:40:22,440
Didn't they replace it with like a Fast and the Furious ride or something?

200
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:32,380
Where the hell am I going? Is it like a... You ride with the screen or something?

201
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:45,079
All right, this map is so bad. I can't even tell you where I am. I have to go this way.

202
00:40:45,719 --> 00:41:16,940
Where's the entrance? Why am I so far away? There's no entrance and no exit. No, I didn't

203
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:28,679
get a cap. Get out of my way. Okay, we're almost done. Now I gotta go this way. I can't even go

204
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:50,219
this way. Left? What the fuck? I have to go there. What is this Final Fantasy VII map? Yeah, it

205
00:41:50,219 --> 00:42:07,719
actually is. Dude, where the fuck? Jaws is over there, so I have to go back from Jaws. But isn't

206
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:28,500
that what I'm doing? Go to animation or right. I can't go anywhere. Okay, we're all the way out

207
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:40,860
here. I need to go down that way. Back up and bang a left. This makes no fucking sense. This

208
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:57,300
makes no sense. So I need to... I'm just going straight again. I just saw in the chat the funniest

209
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:01,940
thing I've seen all week. The funniest thing I've seen all week. Absolutely. Without a doubt. In

210
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:08,179
like the last five plus fucking streams. The funniest thing I've seen all week. You ready?

211
00:43:08,179 --> 00:43:18,900
They said Olive Garden music. That's perfect. That's fucking perfect. This is exactly what

212
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:28,650
it sounds like when you're in an Olive Garden. Why is that so fucking perfect? And you see they're

213
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:40,440
eating your like your fucking tortellini and your endless soup salad and bread bowl. And then they

214
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:46,440
give you that you're out of it. Oh, I'll take the fettuccine Alfredo. Our fettuccine Alfredo.

215
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:53,110
Whipping it up with the... Our fettuccine Alfredo. Whippered up with the most delicious cheese sauce.

216
00:43:53,909 --> 00:44:01,030
And the best, freshest wheat. And don't forget about our soup salad and breadsticks. Only $11.99

217
00:44:01,909 --> 00:44:08,440
at your Olive Garden. We're in the neighborhood. And you order your fettuccine Alfredo when it

218
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:12,760
comes out and then fucking half the goddamn thing is cold and it's enough to feed eight people.

219
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:35,590
Where am I going? Anime voice. Get me... All right. Up here and that way. That way. But it's good. Oh,

220
00:44:35,989 --> 00:44:43,929
it's absolutely delicious. It's unbelievable and it's like $12. I didn't tell you it wasn't any good.

221
00:44:49,239 --> 00:44:52,519
This way. That way. This way. That way. This way. That way. This way. That way. This way. That way.

222
00:45:07,639 --> 00:45:15,610
Anybody feel like I'm... I'm going in... How did I even get here? Can I please ride this?

223
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:34,539
Talk to me. Talk to me. Yes. You can see the demonstration of the climax here. Here's your

224
00:45:34,539 --> 00:45:43,530
seat to see the demonstration. It starts the climax scene when you are seated. Choose your seat.

225
00:45:43,530 --> 00:46:01,130
The demonstration starts when you press A. Holy shit. They don't do that. When did I choose... I

226
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:22,440
didn't even choose my seat. When do we get to see the water world demonstration? This is the water

227
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:54,940
world demonstration. Oh, this reminds me of... So, you know, in some martial art movies,

228
00:46:55,739 --> 00:46:59,340
when it shows the same thing, the guy getting like punched in the face from like 12 different

229
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:12,230
camera angles. It's like bang, bang, bang, bang. I love that shit. I love that. That's what we're

230
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:23,179
seeing right here. I used to love that as a kid. Yeah. But we only got one scene though. Somebody

231
00:47:23,179 --> 00:47:33,610
said, Twitch is shit. Go back to YouTube. I think you're about six years late. Yeah. All right. One

232
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:48,900
more time. One more time. Okay. Get me out. I'm done. I'm done. All right. Do I get a,

233
00:47:48,900 --> 00:48:03,099
do I get a pass for that? You picked the wrong seat. 100 points though. Wow. All right. I

234
00:48:03,099 --> 00:48:05,900
seriously want to spoil our Jurassic Park and I'm fucking never play this game again. I promise.

235
00:48:06,619 --> 00:48:11,539
I promise I'll never play it again. I promise I'll never do it again. Just let me get,

236
00:48:11,539 --> 00:48:23,900
let me do the Jurassic Park ride once. And don't forget our seasonal minstrel, Olive Garden.

237
00:48:24,539 --> 00:48:30,679
When you hear, what's it? Olive Garden. What happens here stays here. What's, what's their,

238
00:48:30,679 --> 00:48:34,360
what's their quote? Olive Garden. When you hear your family, that's what it is.

239
00:48:39,579 --> 00:48:58,570
That would be fucking weird if that was the actual thing. Get the cap. I would,

240
00:48:58,570 --> 00:49:06,570
I would love to get the cap if I could fucking find the way to the entrance. Somebody just said

241
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:19,510
with a heart, somebody loves me. What? Oh, it's garbage. How do I get out of here? I just,

242
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:22,150
I can't see the left, that left road. I can't go there. There's no way to go there.

243
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:25,590
I can't get there. It's not, it's impossible. There's no way. I need to go there from right

244
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:33,739
there. Where do I go? I can't go there. There's nowhere to go. Holy fuck. It was a tiny little

245
00:49:33,739 --> 00:50:09,860
area. Burt. Uh, where are we going? Over here. Olive Garden music. I just need to know.

246
00:50:36,579 --> 00:50:42,019
Olive Garden. Start with our unlimited homemade soup or fresh signature salad and a basket of

247
00:50:42,019 --> 00:50:58,920
our famous never ending breadsticks. Strike one. There's something you can't miss at Olive Garden.

All new giant Italian classics starting at $12.99. Choose from four new specialties done up in a big

249
00:51:05,639 --> 00:51:21,179
way. Feast your eyes on giant. Strike two. With catering delivery from Olive Garden,

250
00:51:22,139 --> 00:51:26,940
we make the food and deliver right to your door so you won't have to lift a.

251
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:43,639
This is definitely an Olive Garden commercial that uses this. I know it is. I've, I've heard

252
00:51:43,639 --> 00:51:57,559
it a thousand times. We're going to get it and it's going to hold on. Never ending classics is back

253
00:51:57,559 --> 00:52:04,489
at Olive Garden. Fuck. It's this like, it's this like warm acoustic guitar. No, no. I know what

254
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:10,519
you're talking about. They, they changed their ad platform in like, in like 2017, they changed it

255
00:52:10,519 --> 00:52:17,579
from like snappy fucking restaurant to like warm. We're sitting around with an acoustic guitar.

256
00:52:17,579 --> 00:52:24,010
Hold on. We're going to go back to like, we're going to go back to like 2006. Check the ad

257
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:28,010
playlist. Is there, there's an ad playlist for Olive Garden? Why the fuck would that exist?

258
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:41,079
From the home of never ending comes never. Spaghetti and meat sauce. So many of us make it.

259
00:52:41,079 --> 00:52:46,199
I. Right. Put your feet up. Now get ready.

260
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:56,500
Why is it all Gordon Ramsay? Right. What happened? Why is what this playlist? Why would you have an

261
00:52:56,500 --> 00:53:02,119
ad for? Okay. I'm on the official Olive Garden channel. I'm going to go back to like fucking

262
00:53:02,119 --> 00:53:11,929
2009 or something. This, I know it is. Somebody's got it. You got it. You actually got it. Do you

263
00:53:11,929 --> 00:53:15,369
actually fucking have this? Please tell me you haven't. Did you find it? If this is a no,

264
00:53:15,369 --> 00:53:25,849
I'll never turn my stream on ever again. What have you done? What have you done? No,

265
00:53:25,849 --> 00:53:36,360
I can't ever turn the stream on again. All right. Give me Olive Garden. Fuck. Olive Garden,

266
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:43,099

it, you can still watch this. They don't even, Olive Garden 24 seven 24 seven breadsticks.

268
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:15,670
Okay. There's spam going on. Friday nights with my best friends. We have one rule. Everyone orders

269
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:20,949
something different. Now at Olive Garden, new smoked mozzarella chicken sauteed and topped with

270
00:54:20,949 --> 00:54:34,059
melted mozzarella and a sauce at Olive Garden. We have one rule. Everyone orders something different.

271
00:54:34,059 --> 00:54:41,980
Now at Olive Garden. Why would that be a rule? Who fucking cares? Well, I wanted to get, I wanted

272
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:49,059
to get the crusted eggplant salad. Well, order it, you fucking weirdo. Why do we have to get

00:54:49,059 --> 00:55:02,099
this different food? This has it. Hold on. Another one. Let me see. You know, I love our family

274
00:55:02,099 --> 00:55:06,420
tradition. What's that? The one where we pass our plates to the right. When did that become a family

275
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:12,659
tradition? When you ordered that. Try Olive Garden's new grilled garlic shrimp, marinated shrimp topped

276
00:55:12,659 --> 00:55:17,619

hair pasta and homemade cream sauce. Two new grilled dishes with endless salad.

278
00:55:25,429 --> 00:55:31,670
I love going out to dinner and ordering food and then just fucking handing it to the next person.

279
00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:36,630
Why don't you just order the food you want? Why don't they make all these fucked up commercials?

280
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:47,190
But it's, it's accurate though. You ready? There's another one. 2005. Got it. Got it. Now you got,

281
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:50,710
well, I mean, obviously you're going to get it in every other commercial. Okay. This is like

00:55:50,710 --> 00:55:55,960
family guy funny moments. What the fuck are you doing? I don't want to watch this.

283
00:55:56,679 --> 00:56:03,219
Okay. This one's called, uh, we're all family. Now this is not, this is not it.

284
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:12,980
That's not it. You got it wrong. Why would you look? All right. Last one. Is this a good one?

minutes of the movie. He has, like, the clothes on his head and he's like, and he's got these in
